WEBVTT

00:52.052 --> 00:54.964
You startled me!

00:55.055 --> 00:56.465
We need to speak on something.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.139
You didn't buy bread, did you, Richmond?

00:59.226 --> 01:02.184
I think it is woeful how we have abandoned

01:02.271 --> 01:05.604
the old, respectable mode
of yeast brewing.

01:05.691 --> 01:09.024
But it is not your place to think.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.022
- Not in my house.
- Our house.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.228
You're my wife.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.860
So in the eyes of the law,
the house is mine.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.408
Well, the law abides
by the will of the estate.

01:18.495 --> 01:22.454
A will my father
quite deliberately crafted.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.957
It vexes me. I'm now quite vexed.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.413
You don't think I'm vexed?

01:31.508 --> 01:35.217
Then why indulge in these vexing matters?

01:53.405 --> 01:56.442
So what really did happen
on that fateful day?

01:56.533 --> 02:00.401
Was it an accident?
Her husband claimed she tripped,

02:00.495 --> 02:04.204
but her friends say
she was anything but a klutz.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.624
Could alcohol have played
a role in her demise?

02:07.711 --> 02:10.874
Perhaps one too many
mint juleps for the lady.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.752
The answers to these questions
might lie with the housekeeper.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.802
Or they might be buried
six feet underground. Who can say?

02:18.889 --> 02:21.505
Oh. What are you doing up so early?

02:21.600 --> 02:24.592
There's a masters of murder marathon on.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.426
Did you finish all the bread?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.514
Mm, there was only one slice left.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.850
I wanted to make a sandwich.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.900
It's breakfast.
What do you want a sandwich for?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.900
For lunch. To take to work.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.279
- You know that thing that adults go to?
- I have a job, dick.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.487
Oh, that's right. You're a...
You're a drug dealer. I almost forgot.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.118
I'm not a drug dealer, okay?
I'm a drug deliverer.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.619
Huh. Big difference.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.496
There is a big difference.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.579
I don't do the deals.
I just deliver the product.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.665
Well, one day,
if you play your cards right,

02:55.759 --> 02:57.279
maybe you can become an actual dealer.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.925
Every kid's dream.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.218
You're an asshole.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.715
I love you too, honey.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.219
Have a great day. Enjoy your high!

03:04.309 --> 03:05.594
I will!

03:10.315 --> 03:12.556
- "Enjoy the high!”
- She was out of control.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.892
That's what people
were saying about her after she died.

03:14.986 --> 03:19.571
That story that came out in the press
was not... it was hot accurate.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.775
So what was the truth?
What was accurate?

03:24.496 --> 03:29.536
Will we ever know?
Stay tuned to find out.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.662
Shit.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.709
Next on masters of murder...

03:54.067 --> 03:56.900
J don't think twice j

03:56.987 --> 04:02.573
j although we'd never make it
tonight I'm gonna fake it &

04:02.659 --> 04:05.571
j only for tonight j

04:13.920 --> 04:17.161
I have to get my roots done at 2:15.
Where the hell is that idiot?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.918
Honey. I don't know.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.680
So what's this all about?
Are you guys finally getting a divorce?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.351
Your father has something
he wants to tell you.

04:30.437 --> 04:34.146
Shortly, I shall be announcing
my candidacy for mayor of Savannah.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.315
- Cool. Good luck.
- Sit down.

04:40.197 --> 04:46.238
Son, I know how much you enjoy doing
absolutely nothing with your life

04:46.328 --> 04:49.912
and spending your allowance on
god-knows-what or god-knows-who.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.580
Are you accusing me
of fucking prostitutes?

04:52.667 --> 04:53.907
- Tanner!
- No, I'm sorry, mom,

04:54.002 --> 04:55.208
but it's really insulting.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.162
I would never pay for sex.
Because I don't have to.

04:58.256 --> 05:02.795
Would you shut your mouth?
I was not talking about your sex life,

05:02.886 --> 05:05.878
- which I have no doubt is quite robust.
- Hell yeah.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.556
In regards to my campaign, there are
gonna have to be some changes made.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.510
I will no longer have the time,
nor quite frankly the energy,

05:12.604 --> 05:15.391
to oversee the day-to-day operations
of Wadsworth manor.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.315
That responsibility
shall fall upon your shoulders.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.018
Why can't mom do it?

05:21.905 --> 05:26.444
Your mother, bless her heart,
will be joining me on the campaign.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.491
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I get you folks anything?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.114
- No, thank you, Nia.
- Okay.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.241
Yeah, get me an iced pumpkin spice latte.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.369
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't think we have that.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.792
Really? That's weird.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.086
Well, then I guess
I'll just get a mango smoothie.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.379
But not too sweet.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.923
Bring him a water, Nia.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.841
- Of course, ma'am.
- Thank you, Nia.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.137
Hey, why doesn't she do it?

05:50.225 --> 05:52.216
- Who?
- The lady that works here.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.925
The one that won't make me a good drink.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.932
Nia is already staff manager.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.934
She has been for years.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.482
There needs to be someone in charge
of the entire operation.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.526
To oversee everything.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.446
I just don't think I have time
to take on another job.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.024
And what do you mean, "another job"?

06:09.119 --> 06:12.703
Me and Preston and Chaz
are working on developing an app.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.405
And what does this app do?

06:15.500 --> 06:18.333
It, like, gives you rides places.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.911
Oh, like uber?

06:21.006 --> 06:25.170
Yeah, kinda. But with sicker cars.
And like super-hot drivers.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.091
Well, I'm afraid your app

06:27.178 --> 06:30.762
is going to have to be put on
the back burner for a little while.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.589
I think I'm gonna have to say no, dad.

06:32.684 --> 06:38.896
Well, then I'm gonna have to say
since Wadsworth manor is your inheritance,

06:42.402 --> 06:43.562
this is horseshit!

06:43.653 --> 06:46.565
Nia will brief you on all the particulars.

06:46.656 --> 06:52.652
Oh, and, son, this property has been
in our family for over 180 years.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.989
Don't you be the one to fuck it up.
Darling.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.263
Hey. Um, it's me.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.219
Hey, come on in.
Make yourself at home.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.804
I'm making some sweet tea.

07:20.899 --> 07:21.899
Mm.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.184
Come on in.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.075
Hi.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.362
Hello.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.819
- That looks good.
- Tis.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.371
- Is that, like, lemon?
- Rainbow.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.164
Rainbow. Cool.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.913
Since I'm a kid, I love lollipops.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.914
Um, hey, are your, like,

07:47.008 --> 07:51.798
parents or siblings here, by any chance?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.879
You wanna make sure I'm alone?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.680
Yeah.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.849
Wait, no. That sounds weird. I kinda...

07:57.936 --> 08:00.247
- Get on the ground!
- On your fucking knees!

08:00.271 --> 08:01.999
You're under arrest
for the solicitation of a minor.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.023
What?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.440
- Hands behind your back.
- Um, okay.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.360
- Okay. Okay.
- You have the right to remain silent.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.092
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.981
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Wait...

08:13.076 --> 08:16.159
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.532
- Not to interrupt...
- With these rights in mind,

08:18.623 --> 08:20.184
do you still wish to discuss
the charges against you?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.540
Yes. I certainly do. Um...

08:22.627 --> 08:26.290
I'm so ticklish.
Is this 72 Jackson street?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.838
No. It's 72 Jackson Avenue.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.509
Oh, my god.
See, this is so funny.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.053
Well, maybe it's not so funny, but it's...
That I can explain.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.008
Solicitation of a minor with the intent
to sell narcotics to said minor.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.934
No, no, no, no. Um, okay.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.727
Not to narc out my bosses,

08:43.815 --> 08:46.648
but I work for a company
called lady Mary Jane.

08:46.735 --> 08:51.399
And I was supposed to deliver
that weed and, um, yeah,

08:51.489 --> 08:55.448
that bag of edibles to 72 Jackson street.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.151
I'm not here for sex.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.952
And even if I was here for sex,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.201
I wouldn't want to do it with him.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.408
How old is he?
Is he like 12 or something?

09:04.502 --> 09:05.617
I'm 19.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.293
You're 19?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.746
That is just... really?

09:09.841 --> 09:12.298
- I'm an actor.
- He doesn't even have pubes.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.546
I have all the pubes. Tons of pubes.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.252
- Like tons of pubes?
- Tons.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.633
That's not something to brag about,
by the way.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.966
Don't lick your lollipop right now.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.143
He's like sexually harassing me for real.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.890
Why don't you arrest this creep?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.643
- He's just doing his job, ma'am.
- What is wrong with you?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.816
Doesn't even have to be acting anymore.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.865
On!

09:37.952 --> 09:39.988
Todd! I'm so glad you're here.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.288
You don't know the difference
between street and Avenue?

09:43.374 --> 09:44.705
I was a little stoned.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.875
- Shocking.
- Todd.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.794
I was arrested for soliciting sex
from a kid today.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.712
Please just be nice to me.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.961
For a change.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.964
Look, my uncle is friends with the da.
I talked to him.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.296
- They're giving you a break.
- Oh, that's amazing!

09:59.390 --> 10:02.132
They're dropping all the drug charges.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.343
All you have to do
is register as a sex offender.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.645
Yeah, right.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.939
Do you know how lucky you are, Hannah?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.859
This could've been way worse.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.902
I sure hope you can
get your shit together,

10:14.989 --> 10:18.527
because this is...
This is really fucking pathetic.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.368
Wait. Are you breaking up with me?

10:22.455 --> 10:26.198
Well, I can't introduce my parents
to a sex offender.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.291
Well...

10:28.378 --> 10:30.039
I'm gonna go pack up your shit.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.961
Well, you know what? Good.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.538
I didn't want to meet them anyway.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.373
What kind of people name their kid "Todd"?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.299
Such a stupid name.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.252
They sound like assholes actually.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.630
I've been cheating on you.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.305
Huh? With who?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.429
With the mailman.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.600
- Betty?
- With the milkman.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.929
- We don't have a milkman.
- Ah, fuck.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.103
Bye, Hannah.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.270
Now, upon the night that general sherman

10:56.364 --> 10:59.356
placed his prized hat
into my grateful hands,

10:59.450 --> 11:03.113
little did I know our home
would forever become an integral part

11:03.204 --> 11:05.411
of Savannah's rich and turbulent history.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.365
Thank you. Thank you.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.666
I would now be more than happy
to answer any queries

11:10.753 --> 11:13.119
you may have regarding our beloved manor.

11:13.214 --> 11:18.254
Yeah. Did general sherman place
anything else into your grateful hands?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.630
No, sir, he did not.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.468
Thank you kindly.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.595
Thank you. Have a good day.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.393
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye. Thank you.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.892
Very impressive, milady.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.269
Thank you, Mr. Wadsworth.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.727
Please, "Mr. Wadsworth"
is so stuffy and formal.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.813
- You can call me Tanner.
- Oh.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.023
Wadsworth.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.607
And...

11:44.287 --> 11:46.243
- Thank you.
- You earned it.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.323
You sounded exactly like you were
an old colonial lady or whatever.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.833
It was really hot.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.501
Thank you, sir.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.453
Let's have dinner tonight. My treat.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.504
Oh, uh, thank you, but...

11:57.592 --> 11:59.332
Fine, we'll split the bill.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.339
I am actually having dinner
with my boyfriend tonight.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.139
Cancel it.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.636
I'm sorry, Mr. Wadsworth.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.391
Hmm, I'm sorry too.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.312
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- What?

12:12.398 --> 12:16.437
Now please leaveth the premises-eths.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.529
Then what'd she say?

12:22.617 --> 12:25.700
Nothing. She was just literally like,
"fuck you."

12:25.787 --> 12:27.243
- But she didn't say it.
- Oh, yeah.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.241
- What a slut!
- Total slut!

12:29.332 --> 12:31.072
"I have a boyfriend who I love."

12:33.586 --> 12:35.451
Oh, my god. It's my fiancée.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.956
Sorry. Gotta Blaze.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.960
Hey, baby.
I've been thinking about you too.

12:40.051 --> 12:45.512
Now I have to register as a sex offender,
which probably isn't going to be easy.

12:45.598 --> 12:51.309
Like if registering your car
at the dmz or whatever is such a bitch,

12:51.396 --> 12:54.809
can you imagine how much more
of a bitch it's gonna be

12:54.899 --> 12:57.265
to register as a sex offender?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.817
You know, I hope it's harder.

12:59.904 --> 13:04.193
If it is easier to register
as a sex offender...

13:04.284 --> 13:08.368
You know,
I think I could be a stand-up comedian.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.662
"What's the deal with
registering as a sex offender?"

13:11.749 --> 13:14.081
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

13:16.796 --> 13:22.962
Uh, I don't actually know
'cause I'm not, like, a real sex offender.

13:23.052 --> 13:27.295
I was set up by this,
like, adult kid actor.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.847
This fruity little youthful narc.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.141
- Ugh.
- I see.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.184
Don't take this the wrong way,

13:35.690 --> 13:37.668
but you're really, really handsome.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.308
If that fake kid today
had looked like you?

13:40.403 --> 13:43.395
Ooh, boy, like, throw the book at me.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.729
Ooh!

13:44.824 --> 13:46.564
Can I ask what you do?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.492
Um, I used to be in
the pharmaceutical business

13:49.579 --> 13:53.743
and now I am self-unemployed.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.289
Hmm.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.334
You just passing through?

13:58.421 --> 14:00.412
No, I live in Savannah.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.087
- Oh, where?
- Where?

14:04.594 --> 14:10.339
What, are you, like, a person who, like,
asks a lot of questions?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.890
I'm a person who would
like to offer you a job.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.058
- Fuck off.
- I'm serious.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.312
Do you have any acting experience,
by any chance?

14:23.112 --> 14:26.400
Um, yes, by some chance, I do.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.573
I know. It's crazy.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.947
I was in an acting play,
drugs are for slugs.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.903
You've probably heard of it.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.613
I played the main slug.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.744
It was part of this, like,
after-school program

14:37.835 --> 14:41.293
for kids whose parents thought
they might end up doing drugs.

14:41.381 --> 14:46.216
So pretty good casting, if you ask me.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.963
I knew you'd be perfect.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.553
There's only one thing.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.973
You'll have to live at Wadsworth manor.

14:55.812 --> 14:56.847
Okay.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.630
So pretty much you'll be in charge

15:04.654 --> 15:07.145
of maintaining the interior
of Wadsworth manor.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.322
Laundry, light cleaning,
things of that nature.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.449
If you have any questions,

15:10.493 --> 15:12.679
you can direct them towards myself
or my brother, Marcus.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.410
And of course you'll be
in charge of leading the tours,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.955
which start promptly at 9:30 every day.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.954
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
Nia, have you seen my toolbox?

15:21.045 --> 15:23.036
I think I saw it in the garage.
Check there.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.622
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.924
Who is that sexy hunk of man meat?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.170
That's Marcus. My brother.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.847
Oh. Cool. Cool.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.016
He seems smart. Oh, what's this?

15:37.103 --> 15:40.140
This is a pretty dress.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.971
Wow! Who makes this?

15:42.066 --> 15:46.605
Yep. Itis a jzp. I knew it.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.659
Who just so happened to be
my great-great-great grandmother,

15:54.745 --> 15:56.406
Josephine Zelda pipkin.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.284
She sewed that into all her possessions,
few as they were.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.913
Zelda, huh?
This is probably a dumb question,

16:03.004 --> 16:05.962
but she wasn't, by any chance,

16:06.048 --> 16:11.384
named after the actual
legend of Zelda, was she?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.711
Moving on.

16:15.558 --> 16:20.894
This right here is the most
prized possession of our Wadsworth manor.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.019
Oh, sorry. This is my most
prized possession, too, so...

16:25.109 --> 16:28.567
When general William tecumseh sherman
stayed here during the civil war,

16:28.654 --> 16:31.066
he was so charmed by lady Wadsworth,

16:31.157 --> 16:33.773
by her hospitality,
graciousness and class,

16:33.868 --> 16:35.904
he gave her his hat as a gift.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.111
Oh, shit.

16:38.206 --> 16:42.495
Lady Wadsworth, that's the role
I'm getting my hands on, right?

16:42.585 --> 16:43.791
That's right.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.493
And she was classy.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.670
The absolute classiest.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.426
Sorry.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.176
I did have a few beers tonight.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.881
Let me show you where you'll be staying.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.307
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.983
Here we are. The lady's bedroom.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.401
Oh, my god!

17:10.488 --> 17:12.228
Remember, this will be part of the tour,

17:12.323 --> 17:15.156
so it's imperative that you
keep it as the lady kept it.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.904
Immaculate.

17:16.993 --> 17:18.700
Wow, this is amazing!

17:21.915 --> 17:24.328
- Shoes?
- Um...

17:24.417 --> 17:27.034
I don't know, I think they're skechers.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.040
Oh! You mean...

17:30.758 --> 17:31.758
Excuse me.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.924
Is there anything else I can get for you?

17:34.011 --> 17:37.174
Uh, no. I think I'm good.
Thank you so much.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.177
Make sure you're well versed
on the history of the manor by tomorrow.

17:40.268 --> 17:43.308
There's a packet with all relevant
information on the side table next to you.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.761
Oh, yep.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.846
- Good night, Hannah.
- Okay. Good night.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.769
What?

17:52.863 --> 17:58.529
"Wadsworth manor,
founded in 1840 by Jennings f. Daubmire,

17:58.619 --> 18:02.453
is one of the oldest
and most treasured historical homes..."

18:02.540 --> 18:04.076
Ugh!

18:33.863 --> 18:34.863
Fuck.

19:13.861 --> 19:18.696
Hear ye, hear ye.
My name is lady Wadsworth,

19:18.783 --> 19:22.492
but you can call me Nancy.

19:22.578 --> 19:29.450
I built this house with my own two hands
in the summer of 1855.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.909
Uh, I know what you're all thinking.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.336
Wow, that makes you super old!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.379
Uh, let me tell you my secret.

19:37.134 --> 19:40.297
Spf 50.

19:40.388 --> 19:45.303
And this is, uh, ye olde living room,

19:45.393 --> 19:49.636
where they used to host parties and shit...
And digs.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.730
Shindigs.

19:52.274 --> 19:56.108
Yes. A question.
A little early for a question, but okay.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.562
Oh, sorry. I just... really quick.
Um, what are you talking about?

20:00.574 --> 20:01.905
I'm sorry, what?

20:01.992 --> 20:05.905
Well, first of all,
your name is Elizabeth, not Nancy.

20:05.996 --> 20:09.238
Uh, this house was built in 1840,
and not 1855.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.245
It's literally right on
the cover of the pamphlet.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.499
And, um, this is definitely not called
"ye olde living room"

20:15.589 --> 20:19.548
because, well, that's-that's ridiculous.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.216
So what-what are you talking about?

20:23.472 --> 20:27.806
Uh, if you'll excuse me
just for one minute. Please.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.178
- Sorry. Uh...
- Please.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.885
- Okay.
- Please.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.016
What the fuck is your problem?

20:33.107 --> 20:35.018
- What's my problem?
- Yeah.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.896
Oh, I'm sorry I was hoping for
some facts on this tour.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.477
I am giving you facts.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.904
- No, you're not.
- Fact after fact.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.856
Not real facts. Not actual facts.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.237
Well, what makes you
so qualified to say that?

20:46.328 --> 20:49.912
- A phd in American history from Harvard.
- Oh.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.832
Yeah. What is going on?
Do you even work here?

20:52.918 --> 20:57.628
Look, I'm just trying not to get fired,
okay? It's my first day.

20:57.715 --> 21:01.173
I'm sorry.
Just, I really need this job. Please?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.215
I'm here with some students
from my seminar.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.720
It's a little weird.
I was hoping they would learn something.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.389
Ah, screw it.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.936
I'll catch 'em up later.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.809
Ugh, thank you. You're so sweet.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.900
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.771
Listen, if you ever want
any actual facts...

21:19.862 --> 21:21.853
- Oh.
- Let me know.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.155
Thank you.
Just gonna tuck it right in here.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.153
Okay. Yeah. No pockets.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.575
- Thank you.
- Sure.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.995
Now where were we
before we were interrupted?

21:35.085 --> 21:37.827
Oh, right,
I was gonna show you ye olde den,

21:37.922 --> 21:39.753
where they used to watch...

21:41.091 --> 21:42.422
Probably plays. Come on.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.795
Right this way.

21:46.096 --> 21:51.887
So, as lady Wadsworth, um,
as I always used to say,

21:51.977 --> 21:56.095
"ye don't have to go home,
but ye can't stay here." Thank you.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.733
Bravo!

22:01.821 --> 22:02.936
Oh, my god.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.737
- You were fantastic.
- Was I?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.692
I couldn't tell the difference
between you and lady Wadsworth.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.822
Oh, my god.
That is so nice of you.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.529
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
- Yeah.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.580
Let's celebrate tonight.
What do you say?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.997
Okay. Sure.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.453
That's the right answer.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.797
Sorry to bother you, but...

22:26.887 --> 22:30.550
Don't worry.
I'll clean it up before the next tour.

22:30.641 --> 22:35.556
I'm trying to figure out what to wear.
I got a hot date with our hunky boss.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.558
- Lucky you.
- What do you think about this?

22:38.649 --> 22:40.389
You think Tanner will like this?

22:40.484 --> 22:43.726
I really think the best thing
is to just be a lady.

22:43.821 --> 22:48.235
That way you can better serve the role
of "the lady." You feel me?

22:48.325 --> 22:52.193
Oh, mm-hmm.
Tanner's into classy ladies.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.495
- Well...
- I got you. I can do this.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.494
My ex-roommate used to watch
downtown Abbey all the time, so...

22:57.585 --> 22:59.871
I guess that's a good start.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.999
- Hey, Nia?
- Yes?

23:03.090 --> 23:05.297
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.669
You're gonna do just fine here.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.762
Mm. I like that dress.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.727
Classy.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.274
Thank you, Nia.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.851
- Huh?
- What?

23:25.946 --> 23:27.777
My name is Tanner.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.940
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Addison,

23:31.035 --> 23:32.679
and I'll be your waitress for the evening.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.193
Can I start you off with some drinks?

23:35.247 --> 23:39.331
Uh, yes, indeed. I think I shall.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.910
- Something classy, of course.
- Would you like to look at our wine list?

23:43.005 --> 23:44.996
Do you think I don't know my wines?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.580
No. Not at all. I was just...

23:46.675 --> 23:50.167
I'll peruse the list just to make sure
the ones you got on it

23:50.262 --> 23:51.798
are classy enough for me.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.754
Very good.
And for the gentleman?

23:54.892 --> 23:57.474
Yeah, gimme a shot of patron
and a vod sodes.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.724
- Huh?
- A vodka soda.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.021
- Yeesh.
- Yeah.

24:06.111 --> 24:10.354
They have got the most sick
tasting fish here.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.276
Ham cubes are fire.

24:12.368 --> 24:13.904
Oh, they have ham cubes? Where?

24:13.994 --> 24:16.076
- Yeah, you can't go wrong.
- No.

24:17.289 --> 24:23.000
I still can't believe you just, like,
swooped into the bar and you were like,

24:23.087 --> 24:27.501
"hi, I'm hot, you want a job
and a sick place to live?"

24:29.468 --> 24:33.211
I know this isn't a classy thing to admit,

24:33.305 --> 24:37.844
but I wasn't really on my way
to join the circus like I said.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.891
I had no real plan.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.929
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

24:43.023 --> 24:48.017
Well, maybe there's some way
you can repay the favor.

24:48.112 --> 24:53.106
Oh, my god.
You're like a knight in shiny armor.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.940
But hotter.

24:55.035 --> 24:58.653
Well, you're pretty great too.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.581
- Do you mean it?
- I do.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.705
Oh. That's so beautiful.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.708
I mean, honestly, you're like a poet.
But hotter.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.838
I can't believe I get to live
in your family's mansion.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.883
Yeah, it's a pretty nice house, I guess.

25:16.974 --> 25:20.432
"Nice house."

25:20.519 --> 25:23.977
Yeah, and the Taj Mahal
is just a "nice hall."

25:25.357 --> 25:29.191
So what was it like growing up
in that "nice house"?

25:29.278 --> 25:30.984
I didn't live in that house.

25:31.071 --> 25:34.939
It's more like a dusty old family museum.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.650
But I get to sell it when my parents die,
so that's cool.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.451
Wow. That's awesome.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.827
What do you say we head back there
and, uh, dust the bed,

25:43.917 --> 25:45.157
if you know what I mean?

25:47.546 --> 25:49.912
I'm pretty sure I do.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.998
You're talking about sex, right?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.423
Bingo.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.030
Can I get you anything else?

25:55.095 --> 25:56.676
Some coffee perhaps, ma'am?

25:56.764 --> 25:58.300
- Why would I want coffee?
- No.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.346
- Hey, uh, Adderall.
- It's Addison.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.223
I just wanted to let you know
that I finished

26:05.314 --> 26:09.478
the entire bottle of the strun...
Jun... junior.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.274
So now who doesn't know their wines?

26:11.361 --> 26:15.070
- Ha-ha.
- Congratulations.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.272
Thank you.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.652
I outclassed the fuck outta her.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.458
You're such a good drunk driver.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.876
Thanks, I know.

26:36.678 --> 26:40.921
Whoa. You kiss like a horse.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.303
Oh, yeah!

26:49.525 --> 26:50.765
I et's do this.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.101
Wait. Okay.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.691
Oh, my god.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.533
Oh, my god, you're so hot. Okay.

27:01.620 --> 27:06.785
I'm just, um... I'm gonna go freshen up.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.708
So just, real quick.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.832
Wanna smoke?

27:27.855 --> 27:29.516
Condoms, condoms.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.065
Thank you, Jesus. I'll be right out!

27:37.156 --> 27:38.942
Oh, you're great.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.906
Eat your heart out, Todd. Dickhead.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.834
Hi. You look comfortable.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.632
Are you having a little nap?

27:59.720 --> 28:02.177
Oh, my god, that's so cute.

28:06.727 --> 28:12.768
Maybe little tan-tan
needs a little wake-up call. Hmm?

28:12.858 --> 28:15.440
Is that a yes? Okay.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.358
Great.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.987
I just wanna make sure
that this is consexual.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.693
Sounds good to me.

28:27.623 --> 28:28.783
Okay.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.489
No!

28:30.584 --> 28:32.120
What the fuck?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.578
Oh, my god! Who are you?

28:35.672 --> 28:39.290
No, poor depraved wench,
the question is who are you?

28:39.384 --> 28:42.922
I am the lady who lives in this room.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.971
And that is my cock
that you are blocking me from.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.595
Now, who are you?

28:48.685 --> 28:52.894
I am lady Elizabeth Wadsworth,
and I am afraid to tell you

28:52.981 --> 28:55.643
I take umbrage with the despicable,

28:55.734 --> 28:58.316
animalistic way
you are behaving in my room!

28:58.403 --> 29:02.112
Yeah. Okay, right.
No, 'cause Tanner told me about you.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.689
You had the job before me, right?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.945
Had I ever the job you possess,

29:06.036 --> 29:09.779
I shall think I would have long ago
gone mad from syphilis. Or worse.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.242
- You think I'm a prostitute?
- I know you to be.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.873
Grateful only that your customer
seems to have saved himself

29:16.964 --> 29:19.671
from whatever lusty madness
with which you mean to inflict him.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.250
Okay. You're nuts. Uh, what?

29:23.345 --> 29:27.258
You quit 'cause you couldn't stand
being around Tanner after he rejected you

29:27.349 --> 29:30.716
and now you're stalking him
but in character!

29:30.811 --> 29:32.722
And I'm the mad one?

29:32.813 --> 29:35.600
Hey, Tanner.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.606
Seriously, wake up, okay?

29:38.694 --> 29:40.434
'Cause your weird stalker is here,

29:40.529 --> 29:43.191
and I don't feel like
getting stabbed by a lunatic.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.822
Hey.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.665
Little known fact,

30:03.760 --> 30:07.719
this is my favorite room
in all of Wadsworth manor.

30:07.806 --> 30:13.176
Can anybody guess why?
Yes. You, the natural brunette.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.851
Because you love to read?

30:15.689 --> 30:18.601
Wrong. Reading is for nerds.

30:18.692 --> 30:23.311
I'm joking. So, over here we have...

30:23.405 --> 30:24.895
Fuck!

30:24.990 --> 30:28.903
That... fuck. Fuck.
That was to illustrate,

30:28.994 --> 30:32.782
uh, the fact that contrary
to popular belief,

30:32.873 --> 30:37.162
women of the time
had the tongues of filthy sailors.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.252
They really did.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.671
It was very customary, uh,
for women to say "fuck"

30:42.758 --> 30:46.046
and "shit" and even "cocktease."

30:46.136 --> 30:49.845
"Pussy" was a very popular
word of the day.

30:49.931 --> 30:53.890
But, you know, "fuck" did not mean
what it means today.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.052
Right? It didn't mean that.

30:57.147 --> 31:01.641
It actually meant
a polite wink at a stranger.

31:01.735 --> 31:07.275
So, in fact, right now,
I am fucking all of you.

31:09.785 --> 31:10.865
Oh, my god!

31:10.952 --> 31:14.865
How dare you pose as me
in my own house, spewing such filth!

31:15.665 --> 31:18.122
Okay, um...

31:18.210 --> 31:21.452
Does everybody see this
old-timey-looking lady right now?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.085
- Hi.
- Holy shit.

31:26.176 --> 31:30.089
You are an abomination.
A filthy tramp, you are.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.513
- What did you call me?
- I didn't call you anything.

31:35.227 --> 31:40.517
Call... call on me.
Uh, I had so many gentleman callers...

31:40.607 --> 31:43.144
- That is a lie!
- Calling upon me.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.726
I was a faithfully married woman.
You take your lies...

31:45.821 --> 31:48.091
- Just one after the other.
- And vacate this house at once.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.875
Just gentleman caller
after gentleman caller.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.523
One after the other. In and out.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.346
You should be ashamed
speaking in such a crass manner.

31:53.370 --> 31:57.613
- It is most unbecoming!
- Okay. Now, that's the end of the tour.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.164
That's it. Um, thank you for coming.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.664
And, uh, please come see us again soon.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.042
Excuse me.
Is that really the end of the tour?

32:07.134 --> 32:09.625
You are a disgrace.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.132
I am not listening to you,
you obnoxious old asshole!

32:14.057 --> 32:15.342
On!

32:15.434 --> 32:17.425
Oh...

32:17.519 --> 32:20.511
Sorry, ma'am, you were great.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.601
What the f...

32:44.588 --> 32:46.203
Come on in.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.505
So many different theories
that it wouldn't...

32:48.592 --> 32:50.423
Oh. Sorry.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.421
I didn't know you were busy with a lady.

32:52.512 --> 32:56.380
Uh, this is my student, Jenny.
Jenny, this is, uh...

32:56.475 --> 33:00.468
Hannah. Hi. I'm an actress.
And a model sometimes.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.427
Fa oiite =

33:02.522 --> 33:07.607
okay. So I guess I'll, uh,
come back when you're not, um...

33:07.694 --> 33:11.186
Oh, no. No!
Jenny and I were just finishing up.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.114
Hannah, uh, so that-that
would be perfect. You can do it.

33:14.201 --> 33:16.567
- Thanks, Dr. plumm.
- Sure. I'll see you in class, Jenny.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.946
- Hi.
- Dr. plumm?

33:21.041 --> 33:24.158
- What?
- Were you guys doing, like, role-playing?

33:24.252 --> 33:28.165
Like doctor-patient shit?
You are kinkier than I thought.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.497
It's nothing inappropriate, I assure you.

33:30.592 --> 33:33.504
- Oh.
- Just regular office hours. I...

33:33.595 --> 33:37.383
Honestly. Yeah.
You can throw it away.

33:37.474 --> 33:40.511
- Don't tell anyone about my office hours.
- Oh, I won't.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.684
That everyone has. All teachers have.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.057
- It's just a student.
- Yeah.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.855
What can I...
What can I help you with, Hannah?

33:47.943 --> 33:50.559
Okay. So you say you're a doctor.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.895
- Well, I am a doctor.
- Okay.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.900
Do you know anyone
who can do an exorcism?

33:56.076 --> 33:58.067
- An exorcism?
- Mm-hmm.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.197
What's this about?

34:00.288 --> 34:03.997
Okay, so,
I was giving a tour this morning,

34:04.084 --> 34:05.790
and lady Wadsworth was on it.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.621
Like, the real lady Wadsworth.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.705
Like, she was a ghost, I think.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.382
But not like a scary, like, ghost.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.007
She was more like
an old-fashioned bitch ghost.

34:18.098 --> 34:21.306
Like all like stuffy and shit.
Like, "neh, neh, neh."

34:21.393 --> 34:24.304
Super annoying and, like, yelling at me.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.226
So now I need to try to get rid of her,

34:26.313 --> 34:28.475
and I thought the easiest way to do that

34:28.567 --> 34:32.650
would be to find someone who knows about,
like, potions and spells and whatever,

34:32.737 --> 34:38.322
like a doctor or a witch doctor
or like a priest who can do an exorcism.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.650
But not like an old weak priest.

34:40.745 --> 34:44.329
I want, like, a hot, young,
like, athletic priest

34:44.416 --> 34:46.577
who can really take a beating.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.205
So what do you think? Can you help me?
Do you know anyone?

34:53.049 --> 34:54.585
Oh, forget it.

34:54.676 --> 34:57.292
What... wait, hold on. I'm sorry. Hold on.

34:57.387 --> 35:00.094
Wait, wait, wait.
I... you just caught me a little off guard

35:00.181 --> 35:03.173
- coming in here talking about exorcisms.
- Well...

35:03.268 --> 35:06.226
So I don't really know much
about this kinda thing.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.805
- It's not my field. Um...
- Sorry.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.561
I do know that exorcisms only really work

35:12.652 --> 35:14.483
if the spirit
is possessing a living person.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.187
So I don't think that would be
your best bet.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.113
Okay, well, thanks anyway.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.407
Well, wait! Where are you going?

35:21.494 --> 35:23.985
- What do you mean? I'm giving up.
- Just like that?

35:24.080 --> 35:28.449
Yeah. This is more effort than I've
put into anything in a long time,

35:28.543 --> 35:29.578
and I'm tired.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.375
- You're tired already?
- Yes!

35:31.463 --> 35:33.875
Well, there might be
some other things we can try.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.125
Okay.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.880
Um, Cynthia,
cancel all my afternoon appointments.

35:41.431 --> 35:42.716
Who's Cynthia?

35:42.807 --> 35:44.343
That's my fake secretary.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.972
I just told her to cancel
all my fake appointments.

35:48.063 --> 35:51.305
Oh, it's a joke.
Oh, yeah. It's funny.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.811
Is that... okay, now see...

35:56.905 --> 35:59.066
Ask about ghosts.
How to get rid of ghosts.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.551
- Think this will be that simple?
- Mm-hmm.

36:00.575 --> 36:01.575
Oh, yeah.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.492
- Ow!
- Oh, my god.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.785
- It's all right.
- Seriously?

36:05.872 --> 36:06.872
It's fine.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.620
Wow. It's really going.

36:11.711 --> 36:15.329
J pushing our way through the crowd j

36:15.423 --> 36:17.709
j wait, he said
got the devil in his head j

36:17.801 --> 36:20.543
I think I'm allergic to Sage.

36:20.637 --> 36:24.175
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.096
J and kick the devil out the door &

36:26.184 --> 36:30.177
j and watch him walk away like a prince j

36:30.271 --> 36:33.559
j once again he's original as sin j

36:33.650 --> 36:37.188
j but there ain't nowhere to run
I got the evidence j

36:37.278 --> 36:38.609
"or"

36:39.155 --> 36:40.155
"or"

36:40.240 --> 36:41.821
"n."

36:41.908 --> 36:43.614
"N mn -

36:43.702 --> 36:46.569
- "clean my roon."
- Huh.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.574
What's a "roon"?

36:48.665 --> 36:52.999
Well, I'm-I'm guessing she meant
"room," with an "m."

36:53.086 --> 36:55.998
I think that's a leap.

36:56.089 --> 36:58.831
How do you know she didn't mean
"clean your roop"?

36:58.925 --> 37:00.005
What's a "roop"?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.800
Exactly.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.175
J once again he's original as sin j

37:06.266 --> 37:10.600
j but there ain't nowhere to run
I got the evidence j

37:13.606 --> 37:16.222
j we still got far to go j

37:16.317 --> 37:19.275
j but there's plenty of time
and we're watching for the signs &

37:19.362 --> 37:21.318
whoa.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.692
What are you, a 13-year-old boy?

37:23.783 --> 37:25.398
These are from the '80s.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.451
It was my favorite era of d.
I'm old school.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.075
- Your favorite era of "d"?
- Yeah. My favorite.

37:31.166 --> 37:36.957
So keep in mind, these are classics
that I'm throwing out right now.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.339
Whoa! Jesus.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.345
See? Old school.
I call this one my Tom Selleck.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.298
Why? Oh, yeah.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.393
J once again he's original as sin j

37:54.481 --> 37:58.019
I am keeping judd Nelson. Okay?

38:01.488 --> 38:03.479
We've been through too much together.

38:03.573 --> 38:06.110
I wonder why I'm the only one
who can see her.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.962
Well, I don't know. You know,
I think when a spirit is stuck in limbo,

38:09.037 --> 38:11.198
it means that they-they need something.

38:11.289 --> 38:15.532
Like something's been left unfulfilled
or unsolved or something.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.495
Then why me?
Why isn't she bugging anyone else?

38:19.589 --> 38:22.547
Maybe you're the only one who can
get her what she wants.

38:22.634 --> 38:28.880
Hey! Is this what you want?
Is this okay? Clean enough for you?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.883
- Pretty clean.
- It's very clean.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.519
- I've never seen so many dildos before.
- Oh.

38:44.614 --> 38:46.400
Even in like a dildo store.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.366
You've been to a dildo store?

38:50.453 --> 38:52.318
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, lots of them.
- Lots?

38:52.413 --> 38:54.495
Yeah. Well, I-1 don't really buy anything.

38:54.582 --> 38:58.746
I just peruse the aisles, you know.
I find it very calming.

38:58.837 --> 38:59.872
Yeah.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.711
I'm just kidding. Obviously.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.217
You know, I can't believe I'm saying this.

39:15.311 --> 39:19.350
Uh, all this exorcising
really worked up my appetite.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.273
What-what are you doing for dinner?
You have plans?

39:23.653 --> 39:28.943
Oh, sorry, I-l kinda just made plans.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.365
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

39:31.452 --> 39:35.445
That's all right.
Um, I'm gonna... I'm gonna head out.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.657
- Okay. Yeah. Another time.
- Yeah. Okay, good.

39:38.751 --> 39:39.831
- Yeah.
- Good, good.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.705
- Sorry.
- No. No, no.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.412
Have fun, uh, with your plans,
and I'll-I'll see you.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.747
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.839
- What's up, bro?
- Nothing. Bro.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.843
What'd you say?

39:59.314 --> 40:00.599
Nothing.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.772
Did you just call me "bro"?

40:02.859 --> 40:05.441
Well, yeah, but you called me bro,
so I thought it was cool.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.770
It's cool for me, not for you.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.776
- Okay, bro?
- Okay. Sorry.

40:10.867 --> 40:11.867
Yeah, you are.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.319
Dick.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.533
What'd you say?

40:20.209 --> 40:21.209
Nothing.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.007
Knock, knock. I got your cock, cock.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.763
- Oh.
- I'm just kidding.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.560
Ha. Good one.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.349
I et me see that smile.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.277
- Uh. There it is. There it is.
- Yeah.

40:52.075 --> 40:56.034
- Mm. One second.
- What's wrong, baby?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
Nothing.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.912
What do you do exactly?

41:00.583 --> 41:02.369
Huh? You serious?

41:03.169 --> 41:05.000
Yeah. Uh...

41:05.088 --> 41:08.831
Like I just realized
I don't really know anything about you,

41:08.925 --> 41:14.340
like, what you do
for a living or anything.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.591
I don't know. I do lots of stuff.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.844
Like with my family business.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.845
Cool. Like-like what?

41:25.024 --> 41:29.358
Like I run family business or whatever.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.356
Oh, sure. Okay.

41:34.742 --> 41:35.948
For shame!

41:36.035 --> 41:38.822
I would never play with
the carnal emotions of a man

41:38.913 --> 41:40.494
in such a childish manner.

41:40.581 --> 41:43.823
Yeah, well, get it through your thick,
translucent ghost brain,

41:43.918 --> 41:45.454
I am not you.

41:45.545 --> 41:48.662
- What?
- Nothing.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.297
If you do not wish to engage
in these debaucherous activities,

41:54.387 --> 41:56.548
then simply extricate yourself
from his presence.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.971
He's clearly not in a sober state of mind.

41:59.058 --> 42:02.095
- It's not that easy.
- No shit. Can you help?

42:02.186 --> 42:05.804
A lady should be neither
a trollop nor a tease.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.435
Yet somehow you succeed in being both.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.609
I can't do this.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.688
Dude, are you serious?
What the fuck?

42:14.782 --> 42:17.945
Yeah. I'm so sorry, um...

42:19.120 --> 42:22.453
I have diarrhea.

42:22.540 --> 42:27.375
Well, I guess we'll just cross that bridge
when we come to it.

42:27.462 --> 42:29.919
Mm, uh, okay. Yeah, we've come to it.

42:30.006 --> 42:32.042
So you should probably go.

42:33.801 --> 42:34.961
Fine.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.302
Wait. Where are you going?

42:38.389 --> 42:39.629
To jerk off in your bathroom.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.215
I can't drive home like this.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.686
I cannot believe you would let him...

42:46.773 --> 42:50.482
Defile himself in
the sanctity of my powder room!

42:50.568 --> 42:52.775
Who cares? It's a bathroom.

42:52.862 --> 42:56.775
I'm sure you've done plenty
of unsanctimoni-bous things in there.

42:56.866 --> 43:00.859
A lady does not indulge
in the scatological particulars

43:00.953 --> 43:02.068
of her daily routine.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.119
Why not? It's natural.

43:04.207 --> 43:08.792
Not everything in nature
needs to be indulged in. Onanism, for one.

43:08.878 --> 43:10.288
What is that?

43:10.379 --> 43:12.335
The spilling of one's seed.

43:12.423 --> 43:17.008
The act of self-arousal
just for one's own pleasure.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.677
Oh, my god. What is wrong with pleasure?

43:19.764 --> 43:21.254
There's nothing wrong with pleasure.

43:21.349 --> 43:24.091
I myself have experienced many pleasures
in my lifetime.

43:24.185 --> 43:25.516
- Baking.
- Easy...

43:26.312 --> 43:27.893
Taking walks.

43:28.773 --> 43:30.013
Writing in my journal.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.565
Journal. Wow.

43:32.652 --> 43:37.362
Should be some good stuff in here, I bet.
Look out, "penthouse forum."

43:37.448 --> 43:41.282
Oh. My god. That was fast.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.109
What can I say, you turn me on.

43:44.205 --> 43:45.945
Um, I'm sorry about that...

43:46.040 --> 43:47.325
Good luck with your shits.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.878
Good riddance! Ugh!

43:53.965 --> 43:57.833
Being so close to that wantonly
spilled seed is making me uncomfortable

43:57.927 --> 43:59.883
so I will take my leave as well.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.929
Wait a minute. Hey!

44:04.016 --> 44:08.259
Don't just leave the door
closed in my face!

44:08.354 --> 44:09.935
I'm talking to you!

44:10.022 --> 44:12.684
Your anger is most unwarranted.

44:12.775 --> 44:15.232
If anything,
I should be the one angry at you

44:15.319 --> 44:18.857
for shamelessly
and so inaccurately impersonating me.

44:18.948 --> 44:21.405
Okay. Let me explain something to you.

44:21.492 --> 44:24.029
I am not pretending to be you. Okay?

44:24.120 --> 44:27.203
I was hired as a tour guide
for this house.

44:27.290 --> 44:29.952
It's not your house anymore,
but people know you used to live here,

44:30.042 --> 44:34.752
so as part of the tour,
I dress as you and I act like you.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.170
Okay?

44:36.257 --> 44:39.590
- Do you get it?
- Well, I think you are a disgrace,

44:39.677 --> 44:43.261
and I won't have people
thinking I behave like you,

44:43.347 --> 44:44.883
a common miscreant.

44:44.974 --> 44:49.559
Hey! I am not a miscreant.
I don't think.

44:49.645 --> 44:52.478
And can you just stay the hell
out of my room?

44:55.943 --> 44:59.401
Oh, okay. Stay outta my room too, please.

44:59.488 --> 45:02.400
Oh...
Not you... not you, Marcus.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.356
It's.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.365
I have a proposition for you.

45:08.456 --> 45:10.913
If you insist on pretending to be me,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.729
for whatever reason you have
concocted in your mad, syphilitic mind...

45:13.753 --> 45:16.586
Oh, my god, for the last time,
I don't have syphilis.

45:16.672 --> 45:23.259
Then I insist that you do so properly,
with dignity and, dare I say, respectably.

45:23.346 --> 45:28.966
In other words, will you allow me
to teach you how to act like a lady?

45:29.060 --> 45:32.348
Oh, I am a lady!

45:32.438 --> 45:36.647
Oh, fine. No. Don't disappear
into the floor or whatever.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.851
I... okay. I'll do it.

45:39.946 --> 45:45.441
Just give me some space and please,
please stop cock-blocking me.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.152
Cock. Blocking?

45:49.247 --> 45:51.533
Just-just let me do me.

45:51.624 --> 45:55.116
- Do you?
- Just...

45:55.211 --> 46:00.706
Let me do some things that are not
necessarily ladylike from time to time,

46:00.800 --> 46:02.256
in my room.

46:02.343 --> 46:06.962
All right. If you will allow yourself
to be taken under my tutelage,

46:07.056 --> 46:09.012
then I suppose I could look the other way

46:09.100 --> 46:13.434
if you would like to occasionally
indulge in a second mint julep.

46:13.521 --> 46:17.389
- Thank you.
- Or have a spot of morphine or cocaine.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.223
Geez, calm down.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.934
Well, one never knows when one
will be taken by the vapors,

46:22.029 --> 46:26.614
especially in this powerful afternoon heat
of these Savannah summers.

46:27.493 --> 46:30.451
- Right. Right.
- Yes.

46:30.538 --> 46:32.824
I think I'll be okay,
but thank you for the...

46:32.915 --> 46:34.451
All right.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.659
Well, then...

46:37.753 --> 46:40.870
I suppose we have
what your gambling addicted customers

46:40.965 --> 46:42.421
would refer to as a deal.

46:43.801 --> 46:48.795
A deal, but only if you
stop referring to me as a prostitute.

46:48.889 --> 46:52.006
- I will indeed.
- Thank you.

46:52.101 --> 46:53.932
As long as you stop behaving like one.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.352
Yeah. I forgot my razor.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.439
Now, the family portrait wall.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.025
This is my aunt Helena.

47:11.120 --> 47:14.078
Uh, so this is my aunt Helena.

47:14.165 --> 47:17.703
Whenever I would have guests
over to the manor,

47:17.793 --> 47:21.661
I would make sure I was properly
dressed and, of course,

47:21.756 --> 47:24.088
I would offer them tea and sex.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.631
- Snacks!
- Snacks!

47:26.552 --> 47:30.545
So, uh, anyway. Right this way.

47:30.639 --> 47:33.631
So a lady should walk
as though her entire body

47:33.726 --> 47:35.762
is being lifted off the ground.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.560
Like a marionette. Like this.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.854
Okay. Marionette.

47:44.570 --> 47:48.062
Bread-making is an art that a lady
should do well to master.

47:48.157 --> 47:51.365
- Diction is very important.
- Hmm.

47:51.452 --> 47:54.444
It's not funny, Hannah. Diction.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.530
Say it. Without laughing.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.286
Diction.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.417
I think I am getting it.

48:05.508 --> 48:09.217
Oh, I can assure you
by any objective measure, you are not.

48:09.303 --> 48:13.467
Who wants to walk like
a fucking marionette anyway?

48:22.316 --> 48:26.480
After every bite of food,
a lady dabs her lips with her napkin.

48:26.570 --> 48:31.030
- Even if there's no reason to?
- Even if there is no reason to.

48:31.117 --> 48:33.324
But in this case, there is.

48:33.411 --> 48:36.027
We have these things called grocery stores

48:36.122 --> 48:40.991
where you can literally just pick up
as much of this stuff as you want.

48:45.297 --> 48:46.662
No.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.713
Miraculously, you keep missing it.

48:48.801 --> 48:52.134
It's actually worse.
It's worse than it was before.

48:52.221 --> 48:53.677
- Try this one. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.755
To sit in solemn silence
on a dull, dark dock

48:55.850 --> 48:57.966
in a pestilential prison
with a life-long lock,

48:58.060 --> 49:00.176
awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock

49:00.271 --> 49:02.432
from a cheap and chippy chopper
on a big black block.

49:02.523 --> 49:03.523
Oh, you gotta be fu...

49:12.700 --> 49:14.907
Careful. Hmm.

49:14.994 --> 49:16.279
Yeah!

49:21.625 --> 49:22.625
Mm!

49:32.636 --> 49:33.796
Oh, my god!

49:33.888 --> 49:36.095
Thou shalt not take
the lord's name in vain.

49:36.182 --> 49:43.055
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.729
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather!

49:45.816 --> 49:47.352
Very good!

49:47.443 --> 49:49.775
This is my cousin Mandy.

49:49.862 --> 49:53.320
- This is my cousin... Mandy?
- She died.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.719
She fell off a horse and broke her neck
right in front of my eyes.

49:55.743 --> 49:56.743
It was awful.

49:56.827 --> 49:59.694
- That's my mother.
- Oh, this is my mother.

49:59.788 --> 50:02.530
A lady is not, under any circumstances,

50:02.625 --> 50:08.040
to produce nonverbal sounds. Hmm?

50:08.130 --> 50:09.540
While in mixed company.

50:09.632 --> 50:12.044
- Do you mean like a fart?
- Oh!

50:12.134 --> 50:16.423
Well, a lady would also not use
a crass term like... like fart.

50:16.514 --> 50:21.304
But if you must expel any naughtiness
from your nether regions,

50:21.393 --> 50:25.477
you would excuse yourself from
whatever room you're in to go be alone,

50:25.564 --> 50:26.974
in another room.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.682
Actually, uh, if you don't mind,

50:29.777 --> 50:32.234
I'm going to test out
this method right now.

50:36.325 --> 50:37.940
By all means.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.027
- Milady.
- Yes.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.125
Did you just come into my room to fart?

50:57.680 --> 50:59.341
Did somebody fart?

51:00.975 --> 51:02.340
I think it was the floor.

51:02.434 --> 51:04.800
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. It's creaky.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.351
Yeah, I smell it now. Yeah.

51:06.438 --> 51:09.020
- Mm-hmm. Mm.
- Mm. Huh.

51:09.108 --> 51:10.268
Hmm. Hmm. Yeah.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.644
- It wasn't you?
- No.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.236
- How's the book?
- It stinks.

51:19.618 --> 51:20.618
Okay.

51:30.963 --> 51:32.669
What are you doing?

51:32.756 --> 51:36.248
A lady arises promptly
to greet the morning.

51:36.343 --> 51:39.506
Ugh. What time is it?

51:39.597 --> 51:42.384
It's 6:00 A.M.,
and I apologize for my tardiness.

51:42.474 --> 51:45.841
Okay. Ten more minutes. Ten more minutes.

51:45.936 --> 51:48.473
No, Hannah. It's time to wake up now.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.054
Yoop, yoop, yoop, yoop!

51:50.149 --> 51:52.105
- Yoop!
- Please shut the fuck...

52:08.834 --> 52:11.951
Hey. We had a deal.

52:12.046 --> 52:14.879
Force of habit. My apologies.

52:16.675 --> 52:17.915
Thank you.

52:19.219 --> 52:20.550
Enjoy your opium.

52:22.723 --> 52:25.510
And it's weed. It's not opium.

53:06.392 --> 53:08.428
Happy anniversary, Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.839
We'd love to offer you
a complimentary bottle of champagne.

53:10.896 --> 53:12.261
Thanks.

53:13.232 --> 53:14.438
Baby Yoda.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.031
Congratulations.

53:24.743 --> 53:26.699
Tanner. Pic.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.416
Make sure you tag me this time.

53:39.717 --> 53:40.752
Okay?

53:43.554 --> 53:46.394
I'd like to
thank you all for coming to my home today.

53:46.432 --> 53:48.548
And I wish you all a lovely day.

53:52.062 --> 53:54.053
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Thank you.

53:54.148 --> 53:57.515
Lady Wadsworth. Look at you.
That was very impressive, I must say.

53:57.609 --> 53:59.289
I only saw the tail end of it,
but so good.

53:59.361 --> 54:02.603
Oh, well, that's very nice of you to say,
professor plumm.

54:02.698 --> 54:04.359
Oh, please don't call me that.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.406
Would you rather be called
colonel mustard?

54:06.493 --> 54:08.484
- Yeah. You know, I would actually.
- Okay.

54:08.579 --> 54:11.036
So what are you, uh, doing here?

54:11.123 --> 54:13.956
Uh, well, uh, I'm the head
of the Savannah historical society.

54:14.042 --> 54:16.249
We're cosponsoring this event
for Grayson Wadsworth

54:16.336 --> 54:17.896
that's coming up here in a couple days.

54:17.921 --> 54:20.537
I was just picking up contracts for that.

54:20.632 --> 54:25.922
I'm so sorry. I saw a dog,
and I, like, spaced out for a minute.

54:26.013 --> 54:28.755
Actually, I just came by to see
if my favorite reenactress

54:28.849 --> 54:31.181
wanted to hang... hang out.

54:32.644 --> 54:34.180
If you want. Or not.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.852
- Not a a big deal. Yeah.
- I would.

54:36.899 --> 54:40.983
I just, like... I would feel like
I was cheating on my new boyfriend.

54:41.069 --> 54:43.811
I'm so sorry. I didn't know you
had a boyfriend. I'm sorry.

54:43.906 --> 54:48.445
Yeah. I mean it's, like, our status
is kind of up in the air right now.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.368
- Right.
- I'm not good at a lot of things,

54:51.455 --> 54:54.037
but one thing I am good at
is reading people,

54:54.124 --> 54:57.241
and I just have a feeling
it's about to get serious.

54:57.336 --> 54:59.418
- Oh. Uh...
- It's gotta be like...

54:59.505 --> 55:03.874
Of course. Of course.
Uh, well, I'm happy for you. That's nice.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.923
- Thank you.
- You deserve...

55:06.011 --> 55:09.720
Uh, I'm gonna go. Well, I'll see you...
I'll see you around.

55:09.807 --> 55:10.807
Yeah.

55:14.478 --> 55:17.470
- That's bullshit, by the way.
- What?

55:17.564 --> 55:19.304
You're good at a lot of things.

55:19.942 --> 55:21.273
I think.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.901
Oh, thanks.

55:32.996 --> 55:35.453
Did that boy finally muster
the courage to ask you out?

55:36.250 --> 55:37.410
Oh, he mustered it.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.583
Oh, thank god. I like him.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.661
Yeah, I like him too.

55:44.341 --> 55:48.004
Oh, I've been dying to talk
to someone about this.

55:48.095 --> 55:51.508
I actually think I'm falling for Tanner.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.678
Don't say it.

55:54.726 --> 55:57.138
- What?
- Mm.

55:57.229 --> 56:01.518
Okay. Look, I know he comes across,
like, weird a little bit.

56:01.608 --> 56:07.023
Like a little bit cool
and, like, douchey, but...

56:07.114 --> 56:09.275
And he's also a little, um...

56:09.366 --> 56:12.153
- Married?
- Married. Yeah, and, like...

56:12.244 --> 56:13.780
Wait, married?

56:13.871 --> 56:15.736
Married, like married to his work?

56:21.461 --> 56:24.328
I'm sorry, honey. I thought you knew.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.177
Wow.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.632
Hey, sweetie.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.305
Tum-tum all better?

56:39.688 --> 56:42.350
- Where were you?
- Sorry I was a little late.

56:42.441 --> 56:45.854
Keeping a lady waiting is not
a gentlemanly thing to do.

56:45.944 --> 56:47.559
A lady?

56:47.654 --> 56:51.943
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Don't you think I'm a lady?

56:53.035 --> 56:54.616
You're sexy when you're mad.

56:57.539 --> 56:58.654
Are you married?

57:01.919 --> 57:02.999
Yes, I am.

57:03.086 --> 57:05.372
But before we get into that,

57:05.464 --> 57:08.422
I think we need to talk about
your performance the last few weeks.

57:08.508 --> 57:09.588
What about it?

57:10.636 --> 57:11.921
It hasn't been good.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.421
So I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

57:16.642 --> 57:18.598
- You're firing me?
- You were right.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.846
You're just not cut out for this.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.519
What are you doing?

57:26.610 --> 57:27.725
What do you mean?

57:27.819 --> 57:30.231
- You just fired me.
- Yeah.

57:30.322 --> 57:32.358
I fired you. I didn't break up with you.

57:32.449 --> 57:35.156
Let's make your last night here
a special one.

57:39.706 --> 57:43.949
So then he was like,
"we should fuck anyway."

57:44.044 --> 57:46.035
And I was like, "hmm, what?"

57:46.129 --> 57:48.211
And he was like, "yeah."

57:48.298 --> 57:50.584
And I was like,
"I'm not gonna go near your dick."

57:50.676 --> 57:53.634
- Anna.
- Sorry. It's Hannah.

57:53.720 --> 57:57.508
Okay. Um, I have other customers
I have to take care of, so...

58:03.397 --> 58:04.603
Where?

58:05.440 --> 58:08.853
Here. Surprise!

58:10.487 --> 58:12.819
- Whoo!
- Shit.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.363
It's fun to be a ghost.

58:15.450 --> 58:17.816
Boy, what I wouldn't give
for a mint julep.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.447
I miss my mortal lips.

58:19.538 --> 58:23.531
What are you doing here?
I mean, how can you be here?

58:23.625 --> 58:25.411
I can be anywhere I want to be,

58:25.502 --> 58:27.993
even in this place of ill repute.

58:28.088 --> 58:33.128
So you've just been choosing to be
in the mansion this whole time?

58:33.218 --> 58:35.379
I have. And what of it?

58:35.470 --> 58:37.927
L... it's just...

58:38.015 --> 58:41.382
- So boring.
- Hmm.

58:41.476 --> 58:45.594
Hannah, if you do not wish to share in my
company this evening, please just say so.

58:45.689 --> 58:47.417
I can see you are here with
a group of friends,

58:47.441 --> 58:49.272
of which I am clearly not welcome.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.725
Oh, no, these are just mine.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.186
I'm-I'm here alone.

58:54.281 --> 58:55.942
I actually could use some company.

58:56.033 --> 58:58.900
Well, you must get yourself
to an apothecary immediately

58:58.994 --> 59:01.280
for some leeches
or you'll risk death by alcohol!

59:01.371 --> 59:05.410
No. I'm fine. I'm good.
I've got the tolerance of a fat guy.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.537
By the way,
did you hear I got fired tonight?

59:08.628 --> 59:12.371
Hopefully the new "you"
is gonna be more to your liking.

59:12.466 --> 59:16.505
- Why did the pipkins fire you?
- Huh?

59:16.595 --> 59:19.211
What error did you commit
to lose favor with them?

59:19.306 --> 59:21.547
Why do you think the pipkins fired me?

59:23.018 --> 59:25.179
Well, because they own the house.

59:26.646 --> 59:29.388
They... they do?

59:29.483 --> 59:32.225
Don't be silly. Of course, they do.
I left it to them.

59:35.822 --> 59:39.064
Holy fucking shit.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:03.756
Oh, there you are.
Before you say anything, hear me out.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:07.468
I need your help,
but not because you're a man, okay?

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:08.642
Okay.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.062
- Because you're a nerd.
- Oh.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.891
- Why are you so out of breath?
- Oh, my god.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.567
I've been running around
this whole dumb place looking for you.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.237
- Well, wasn't in my office.
- Tanner kicked me out.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.324
Oh. I'm so sorry.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.178
And I'm pretty sure
his relatives might have stolen

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:25.365
Wadsworth manor from Nia's relatives,
according to the ghost.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.618
Anyway, I think I like her.
I think we might be friends.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.074
And, like, it kinda sucks
nobody but me can see her.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:34.206
Also, can I crash on the couch
in your office for a few days?

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.004
Please”? And by the way,
why aren't you in your office?

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.341
Should I go, Dr. plumm?

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.047
- No.
- Oh, wow.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.508
Dewey... what?

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.015
I-I mean, I wasn't expecting that.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:53.563
- Expecting what?
- I'm sorry, Dewey.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.687
Actually, it kind of makes sense.

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:59.019
You know, look, I know that I hurt you

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:03.232
and I'm really sorry,
but you moved on really fast.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.442
He's ..

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:08.199
Dewey, hold on one second.
Just give me a minute, okay?

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.655
Sorry, Dewey.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.489
- He's my student, idiot.
- Sure.

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:14.497
- All right, look...
- I mean, I get it, like...

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:18.297
What? Sorry, Dewey.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.624
You can crash on the couch
for a day or two,

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.883
but I gotta start drawing boundaries
for myself, okay?

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:28.181
I can't help you out any more than that.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:31.635
Okay. I... I understand.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.015
I'm sorry. Hold on.

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.573
Oh, gimme a break!

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:55.868
Sorry.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:07.888
No, it's just about the dumb tour
and the Wadsworth's.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:12.263
There's a whole worldwide web
of information.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.639
What do they call it?

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.766
Well, they call it the Internet, okay?

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.519
- Internet.
- Yes.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:24.988
Oh. There's that bespectacled
gentleman caller of yours.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.033
I fear he suffers from consumption.
He does not look well.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:30.826
No, he's just a nerd.
That's what they look like.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.199
A nerd.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.702
- Maxi-pad! Yoo-hoo!
- Shh!

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.330
- I'm here by this computer.
- Shh!

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.078
Who's shushing?

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:41.663
What are you doing?

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.669
Why are you talking like that?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.376
What do you mean?
It's a library. I'm whispering.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.553
That's just as loud as I was being!

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.050
Shh!

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:53.133
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Shh!

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.389
- What are you even doing here?
- Research.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.347
Something that you
wouldn't know anything about.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.352
It's literally what I do for a living.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.230
What books have you been looking in?

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.607
Oh, yeah, they have books here.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.782
Look, this is not me helping you,

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:12.156
but you're gonna have much better luck
finding anything from the 1800s

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:14.078
if you go to the county courthouse.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.685
That's where they keep all that stuff.
Wills, deeds, everything.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.452
Yeah, I know.
We were going to do that next.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:20.706
But thank you.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.960
Consumption. I told you.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:42.349
Ma'am? Ms. gunderson.

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:44.856
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you may.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:49.315
Uh, I am a cold case attorney
from the firm, um...

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:54.821
- Salt and pepperstein.
- Okay.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:04:00.329
And, um, I would like to
heretofore request the will

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:04.914
of one Elizabeth Wadsworth
from the year...

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.669
- 1875.
- 1875.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.719
Best I can do is provide you
with a printout copy.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.638
Uh, I'm not sure if you heard me,

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:18.389
but I'm an attorney, so, like,
I'm gonna need the original copy.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.391
This is all public record.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.939
- Oh, is it?
- What does that mean?

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.982
What does that mean?

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.062
That means you don't have to pretend
to be an attorney to see them.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.238
Sorry.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.907
The records from that era
are no longer available.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:35.610
They were converted to digital years ago.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:41.826
But this should suffice
for whatever your purposes are.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:46.580
Just regular purposes.
Like nothing weird. Just...

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:51.885
I don't believe it!
This document has been forged!

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.257
How do you know it's been forged?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600
Bluetooth.

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.766
That is not my signature!

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.139
- I didn't do my h's that way.
- Oh.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:06.191
I put a squiggle with my w's.
And I would never use a quill that thin.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:10.486
And the ink I used
is so much thicker, Hannah.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.565
I had the most beautiful penmanship.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:17.073
I simply do not understand why
my husband would have done this.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:20.530
I was explicitly clear
that Wadsworth manor,

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:24.038
my beloved father's home,
would be left to the pipkin family,

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:26.085
since I could not bear
children of my own.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.914
Wait, so if you couldn't bear children,

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.624
that means you're not even
related to Tanner?

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.927
I am not.
After my death, my husband remarried

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.345
and began a legacy of his own.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.594
A legacy that is thriving today.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.597
I don't know if I'd say "thriving."
He's a total dick.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:43.599
You and that word "dick."

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.432
It's a shortened version
of "Richard," yes?

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.484
I have known many,
many dicks in my lifetime.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:52.483
I don't understand why it took you
over 100 years

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.906
to figure out that he fucked you over.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:58.281
- Ugh!
- Oh! That he screwed you over.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.783
Messed you over?

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.034
That's better.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.834
You know, for a ghost,
your powers are pretty limited.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.004
Aren't you supposed to be, like,
all-knowing or whatever?

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.423
I just assumed my wishes
had been fulfilled.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.377
Nia always seemed so in charge,
like her mother before her.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:18.680
Okay. I have watched enough
cold case shows

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.472
to be able to figure this out.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.520
The first thing they do is
they talk about what they already know.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:29.600
So, what do we already know?

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:34.859
- Wadsworth manor has tours.
- You can write on a wall.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:39.318
- I, Hannah, worked there for a while.
- Just wipe it right off.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.447
You, lady Wadsworth,

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:47.659
is a ghost with crappy powers.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.871
That's hurting my feelings a little bit.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:53.331
"Crappy powers."

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:58.841
Oh. Anyone can get a will
from a courthouse.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:04.634
Well, you have just
broken this case wide open.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:06.060
Oh. Sarcasm.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.014
I didn't think that was invented
until the 1900s.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:14.228
You know, for such an anal lady,
you're actually pretty careless.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:17.439
I don't know why you
wouldn't have made a duplicate copy

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:18.990
of the will or something.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.409
- Of course I made a duplicate copy.
- What?

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.908
- Where is it?
- In a book in my bedroom.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:26.205
Oh, my god!
Why didn't you tell me that?

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:29.705
We've wasted so much time
doing all this research!

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.253
Well, surely the duplicate
would have been discovered by now.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.660
My crucial mistake was putting it

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.708
inside of such a wildly popular
work of literature.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:39.089
Where did you put it, in the Jesus book?

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.262
- The Bible?
- Yes.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:44.716
Close. The American woman's home
by Harriet beecher stowe.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.598
Oh, my god.
Did you erase my lesson plan?

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:50.101
Look, I'm sorry to offend you,

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.603
but what we are doing
is so much more important

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:53.854
than your little lesson plan.

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.778
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah. I can see that.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:08:01.324
You know, if you're not gonna help,
I'm going to kindly ask you to leave.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:04.403
- This is my office.
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:08.991
Out of curiosity, how much longer
are you planning on living here?

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.537
Hold that thought.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.872
You don't happen to know
someone in the play department,

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.959
by any chance, do you?

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.212
What?

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:27.474
And while I lived here, I hosted...

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:30.099
I'm sorry, but the 12:00 tour
already started, rabbi.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.474
You can come back for the 2:00.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.477
Uh, that's okay.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:37.937
I have to, uh, snip a little boy's
wiener at that time,

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.272
so, uh, I'll just go to this one.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.779
Uh, enjoy the tour.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.787
Mazel.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:52.625
In fact, in a few days,
this lobby will once again host...

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:13.430
Yes!

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:18.109
Thief! I must insist that you
vacate my bedroom at once!

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.232
It's me.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.486
Oh, my god. It's Hannah, you idiot.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.362
- Oh, my word!
- I found the will.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:28.327
What kind of sorcery is this?

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.076
How have you come to
transform yourself so?

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:35.163
I got bit by a dog that has rabbis.

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.870
Oh, you don't get it.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:40.877
I get it. I just don't find it
to be humorous.

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:42.832
Oh, like you would know funny.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.511
I thought it was against
the lady rules to even laugh.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.840
It's against them to indulge in laughter.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.768
That's nuts.
Laughter is such a great part of life.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.765
A little laughter is fine.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.472
A touch of silliness.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:10:00.606
I myself have been known to make
a silly face from time to time.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.359
- Really? Let's see it.
- Mm-mmm.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.155
I want to see it. Come on.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.577
That's it? That's your silly face.

01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:11.700
- Yes!
- Oh, come on.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.498
It's like this. It's not even...

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.789
Okay. Try this one.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.216
How about this?

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:23.879
- Oh, I couldn't possibly.
- Come on.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.490
- I couldn't possibly!
- You were going like this. Try this one.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.365
I'd love to hear what's so funny.

01:10:57.962 --> 01:10:59.202
What have you got there?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.333
Oh, nothing.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.085
Psst. Catch.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:06.634
On!

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.554
- Hello, police?
- Fuck.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:13.678
I'd like to report a break-in
at Wadsworth manor.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.849
Now we must remain calm,

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:19.521
so we can figure out how to
get another copy of that will

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.961
since your carelessness destroyed it,

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:23.192
along with my most cherished book,
I might add.

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.565
Oh, I destroyed it?
You're the one who didn't catch it!

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.238
I cannot touch material things
of this world. You know that!

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.908
Then how the fuck were you
planning on reading the book again?

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:34.579
- Your language is...
- Is unladylike?

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:38.032
- Yes!
- Guess what, Lizzie, it's not 1875.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.584
Ladies say "fuck" and "shit" and "fart,"

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:44.289
and sometimes, gasp,
they actually do fart and shit and fuck!

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:47.591
- At the same time?
- Time to catch up to the 20th century.

01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:50.507
That's what I meant!

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:53.260
You always gotta be right, don't you?

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:55.808
I'm just never good enough
or smart enough

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:57.760
or-or fucking ladylike enough.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:00.767
And I am so sick
of constantly being reminded.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.691
Well, I am so sick of having to remind!

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:06.485
You are so utterly careless
with your own affairs.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:08.425
I was a fool to think
you could help me with mine,

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:09.489
as friends are wont to do.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.907
Friends? Oh, we're not friends.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.826
I never asked to be part of your life.
Or afterlife.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.828
Or whatever the fuck this is.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:22.285
Everything okay in here, ladies?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.871
Uh, can I request a transfer?

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:30.714
Well, if that is the way that you feel,
then I will not bother you anymore.

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:31.965
I'm sorry I haunted you.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.047
I'm sorry if I have caused you any pain.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:39.352
And I'm sorry for any cock blockage
I may have put you through.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.640
Oh, wait! Don't go!

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.478
Okay.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:50.563
I'm jinx, by the way.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:53.149
You got any extra meds that I can get?

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:58.163
Hey, rabbi. You made bail.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:01.824
I'm over here.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:05.036
Actually, I think I'm gonna walk.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.213
- I've got work to do.
- Oh, yeah?

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.838
Yeah.
Someone's gotta save Wadsworth manor.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:13.635
- You really care about her, huh?
- What do you mean?

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.492
Lady Wadsworth.
Remember, it wasn't that long ago

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.132
we were trying to Sage her
out of existence.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.597
I care about Nia.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.178
She deserves that house.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.889
And I'm gonna make damn sure she gets it.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:51.796
It's, like, how the fuck
am I supposed to do this by myself?

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:56.346
Like, who do I think I am?
Do you know who I am?

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.469
Do you? Huh? Like...

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:06.098
I was friends with a ghost,
like, an actual ghost,

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:12.483
and now it's like, like,
Tanner is such a dick!

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:15.781
You know, like, who cares”?

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.324
Like, who cares?

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:24.537
Listen, I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, but here's the deal.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.243
You're a smart, confident woman,

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:30.296
who I fully believe could do
anything she sets her mind to.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.873
Now go do it.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.214
- Go.
- You're right.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:39.889
I can do anything you set my mind to.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.261
Close enough.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.718
I'm gonna make you proud!

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:48.432
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
You still have a tab here for $279.

01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:53.486
- How you want to settle that?
- Oh. What? Oh.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:57.360
Yeah? 'Cause my friend is,
like, calling out to me.

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:00.443
No, I'll be right there! Sorry.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:05.618
I-I don't hear anything.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:23.887
When I was alive, I hosted
a number of festive galas and balls.

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:27.891
In fact... we may once again
play host to such an event.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:31.941
And right over here, of course,
we have general sherman's hat.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.565
J maybe living on another shore j

How's the investigation going, Sherlock?

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.244
I would kindly thank you
not to patronize me.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:12.666
You sound like you're giving a tour.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:16.916
I'm sorry. Seriously, how is it going?

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:22.127
Not great. I just feel like
I'm missing something.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.507
Oh, I got it!
You're missing your pipe and your hat.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.260
Sherlock? Get it?

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.806
Oh, my god!

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.332
I'm sorry.
That was the last one, I swear.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.722
No. The hat.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:37.809
It's in the hat! Holy shit.
You're a genius!

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:40.690
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm not following you.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:44.899
Okay. It doesn't matter.
I will explain it to you on the way.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:46.154
On the way to where?

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:48.577
On the way to the fancy campaign
thing that you're hosting.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.620
- Come on!
- That's not for another four hours.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:53.324
Come on, great. Well, that will give us
time to find costumes.

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.080
Costumes?

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.036
Welcome to Wadsworth manor.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:58.746
Damn it, Hannah. If Tanner sees you,

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.402
- he's gonna flip his shit.
- I know, but...

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:04.010
No! No! Sorry. Sorry, freaks.
Not on the list.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:07.805
Oh, well, actually, um, I am Max plumm,
head of the Savannah historical society

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.972
and keynote speaker for the evening.
Check your list.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.476
We'll just get one of
the other history nerds to do it.

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:16.021
Babe, what the fuck?
You just left me there talking to...

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:18.144
Oh, my god, stop.

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:19.691
- What?
- I can't.

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.894
- You can't what?
- Deal.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:23.525
- With what?
- I'm dead.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.572
I cannot deal with your outfits.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:28.116
- I'm obsessed.
- Oh. That's a good thing...

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.240
Well, it's a funny story.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:33.744
Hannah used to work here
until she was let go.

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:36.917
Don't know if you care to explain
to your wife the reason behind that.

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:38.494
Bro.

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:58.435
I simply adore your costumes.

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:00.937
Oh, I simply adore yours.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:03.936
Wonderful.

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:06.647
Gertrude armitage.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:09.825
My ex-husband went to school with Grayson.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:11.777
Did he now?

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:15.490
This is my second husband.
This is Felix.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:20.920
Oh, hello. Lady Wadsworth,
and this is my first husband...

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:24.089
- Um...
- Uh, Richmond Wadsworth.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.041
She forgot my name.

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:28.343
Please forgive me.
I was already thinking of

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.843
who I would like my second husband to be.
Perhaps Felix.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.220
Ooh! I'm gonna keep you two apart.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.767
Grayson!

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:37.264
Felix, hello there.

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:39.893
You simply must meet
our charming new guests.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:43.272
Well, charming,
I'm afraid I can't argue with,

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.148
but we are anything but new.

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.730
Yes, because we are dead.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.899
- Yeah.
- Well...

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:54.203
I just love the fact
that you have decided to dress

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.281
as our beloved ancestors.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.331
It's charming. Simply charming.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.125
And may I introduce my wife.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.827
- Lydia.
- Charmed.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.878
I'm charmed too.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.877
- Oh!
- The hem of your dress is filthy.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:10.007
Oh, and who is this
charming little rascal?

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:14.507
Don't mind mother.
She's not of sound mind, I'm afraid.

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.592
Sounder mind than you, rummy.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.678
Mother. Please.

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:19.807
If you'll excuse us,

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:21.809
I think she just may need
a breath of fresh air.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.357
- Yes.
- Come along, mama.

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.527
So nice catching up with you.

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:29.070
Is that the accent you're going with?

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.319
- No good?
- It's awful.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.616
- Really?
- It's so bad.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:35.820
Attention! Your attention, please.

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:38.872
As most of you know,
my name is edna Smythe.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:42.960
Please. Save your applause until the end.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:47.165
Now, as vice chairwoman of the sps,

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:50.717
I feel fortunate to introduce
one of the earliest inhabitants

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:52.920
of this stunning domicile.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:56.382
But before I do,
I'd like to say a few words about...

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:57.967
Just "Wadsworth."

01:20:58.062 --> 01:20:59.097
"Wadsworth."

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.769
- Oh, my god.
- "Oh, my god."

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.767
You gonna do my airbnb joke?

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.066
- I don't think so.
- I think that's a mistake.

01:21:06.153 --> 01:21:08.940
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm gonna lose my job.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:12.194
Of the glorious
historical legacy of Savannah.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:17.529
Ladies and gentlemen,
I ord Richmond Wadsworth.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:22.708
Thank you!
What a wonderful introduction.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:25.832
Thank you kindly.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:30.508
It is an honor to be back here
for this most auspicious occasion.

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.585
But it is not I to whom this house

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:35.762
owes its rightful place
among Savannah notoriety.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:39.592
In 1865, general sherman and his troops,

01:21:39.686 --> 01:21:43.144
while they held my wife
hostage at gunpoint,

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:49.728
and this is after they savagely marauded
and pillaged their way across Georgia.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.985
Too bad they didn't just use airbnb.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:22:03.625
So now, may I present my lovely wife,
the lady Elizabeth Wadsworth.

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:07.168
Oh, shit.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.526
Thank you kind citizens of Savannah.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:12.508
I'd like to thank my husband
for that kind introduction,

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:17.588
even though, truth be told,
he wasn't always the kindest husband.

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:20.049
For one thing, he murdered me.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:22.100
So

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.562
What... what did she say?

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:29.016
What I said was your relative murdered me.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:35.357
I'm pretty sure he did, anyway.
Uh, but I am definitely sure of one thing.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:39.364
This house, known as Wadsworth manor,

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.413
was, in fact,
not left to the Wadsworth's at all.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:46.617
It was left to the family of my friend,
Josephine pipkin.

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:49.328
Oh, snap.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:52.165
Dear? Whatever is she talking about?

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:53.874
Okay, enough! This is crazy.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:56.130
I know this lady, and she's no lady!

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:59.588
There are cameras everywhere, idiot.
Don't do something stupid.

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:04.643
I recently came into possession
of the original will, uh, my will,

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:07.972
which I found had been doctored.

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:11.229
Sadly, that will was destroyed

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.858
because of a clumsy miscalculation
on my part.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:19.362
I tried to, uh... it's a long story.
It's not important.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:24.368
But I do have here my diary.

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:28.201
Here. My diary.

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:29.501
Jesus Christ.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.874
Which can easily be authenticated.

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:36.208
"The hat. Now my hat,
once a symbol of Southern aggression,

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:40.216
I hereby proclaim anew
as a symbol of Southern hospitality

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:44.926
and fellowship to all persons
be they rich or poor, white or black.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:49.684
And I further declare
whosoever possesses this hat

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:53.609
to be the rightful owner of the manor
in which it should forever rest."

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:58.484
- My dear, my dear, my dear.
- Yeah.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:01.692
I do admire your dedication
to this matter.

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:04.529
- Thank you.
- But that hat has been in the possession

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:06.579
of my family for generations now.

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:09.409
So, if we could get on
with the festivities.

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:11.856
Marcus, would you escort the young lady
from the stage please. Madam?

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.838
- Just one minute, sir.
- Marcus! Do your job!

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.007
Wait! Wait! I can explain!

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:23.468
Nia. Nia pipkin,
will you please come up here?

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:31.973
Now, Nia, what did your great-great-lots-
of-greats-grandmother

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:35.525
always sew in everything that she owned?

01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:37.564
Her initials.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:40.814
- Her initials.
- So?

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:45.323
Josephine Zelda, it is not just the name
of a legendary video game, sir...

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:50.875
- What is she talking about?
- Pipkin. Jzp.

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:56.797
Sewn into every dress, every pair of socks
and every hat that she owned.

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:58.293
Darling, your cane?

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:01.217
- You sure about this?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.810
Everybody, please stand back.

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:14.265
And the truth shall reveal itself.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.480
What is she doing?

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:23.566
Okay. I'm just gonna... just...

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.070
Fucker.

01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:29.116
Uh... okay. Oh, god.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:30.875
Okay!

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:38.121
Oh, my god.

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.217
All right.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.587
Sorry about that.

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:49.675
As I said, the truth shall reveal itself.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.058
Show me "jzp."

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.843
- Huh.
- Very exciting, wasn't it? Very exciting.

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:05.949
That was a wonderful performance.
Just wonderful.

01:26:06.036 --> 01:26:08.368
Okay. Let's go, psycho. Come on.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:11.197
I don't get the big deal
with that ugly old hat.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:14.078
It used to be filthy. Like your dress.

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.730
What do you mean "it used to be filthy"?

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:17.210
It used to be filthy, yes,

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:21.256
until I took it and had it cleaned
and had the old lining restored.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:25.638
Okay.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:31.308
Jzp!

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:37.181
Marcus, do your fucking job
and get her outta here.

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:38.936
I don't think I work for you anymore.

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:43.895
What about the murder?

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:47.608
Oh, right. Oh, my god.
The-the murder. Uh, yes.

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:51.116
Because I, Elizabeth,
was unable to bear children,

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.743
my husband became increasingly agitated.

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:58.453
In fact, he became very abusive
and, in short, he was quite a...

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:01.789
How would you say? Kind of a...

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:02.883
Dick.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.006
Ah, yes, thank you. A dick.

01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:12.925
"I fear Richmond,
perhaps in an intoxicated state,

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:14.884
of which he is increasingly prone
to being in,

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.811
may come to do me harm."

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:21.608
That was one of the lady's
last diary entries.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:25.608
She died one week later
of injuries sustained

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:28.611
from a fall, you guys.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:32.786
Oh, friends, ladies and gentlemen,
please, please.

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:36.286
Tonight marks the launch
of my campaign for mayor of Savannah.

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:40.210
And as mayor, one of my chief goals
is to promote justice

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:43.039
for all of Savannah's citizens.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:48.253
In light of the information
and evidence presented here tonight,

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:51.679
I do hereby bequeath this house...

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.177
Did he just say "queef"?

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.133
And all the contents herein

01:27:55.228 --> 01:28:00.518
to its rightful heirs,
and my dear friends,

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:04.522
- Nia and Marcus pipkin.
- This is retarded bullshit!

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:06.174
So, ladies and gentlemen... son...

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:10.237
Would you all kindly raise your glasses
and join me in a toast.

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:13.573
To pipkin manor.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.040
Wonderful! Mama, drinks in the bar.

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:32.071
She's gone?

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:33.784
Yeah.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:35.742
It's a good thing.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:39.617
Thanks to you,
she's not stuck here anymore.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:43.040
- And thanks to you.
- Yeah.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:05.142
How's everybody doing today?

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.689
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah.

01:30:06.776 --> 01:30:07.776
Awesome.

01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:16.984
Oh, shit. Oh, I overslept.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:19.785
Come on. Five more minutes.

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:24.583
- Oh, I would love to, but I can't.
- Okay.

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:34.046
- Five minutes. Four minutes.
- Jesus.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.097
Knock 'em dead, lady.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:40.594
Yeah, no problem.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:42.641
My brother will reach out to you.
Thank you.

01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:44.845
Nia, I'm so sorry.
We forgot to set the alarm.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.396
Girl, you're fine.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:48.940
- Have fun on the tour.
- Thank you!

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:52.773
Well, the lady should be here
any minute now.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.942
Oh! And here she is now.

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:01.682
Thank you, lord pipkin.

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:03.321
I am your humble hostess,

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:04.906
lady Elizabeth daubmire.

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:07.208
I'd like to welcome you to pipkin manor.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.206
Today you'll learn a bit about me,

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:13.006
but mostly I'll be telling you
about this beautiful manor

01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:15.209
and why it is so very, very special.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:19.637
So, today's tour will begin
where all good home tours should begin,

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:22.136
in the bar room.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:24.013
Usually, I like to wait until the sun

01:31:24.104 --> 01:31:26.311
has dipped below the banyan tree
in our backyard

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:29.640
before I have my afternoon
mint julep, but...

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:34.061
Since-since y'all are here...

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:38.357
Why don't you go on ahead
with lord pipkin,

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:39.987
and, uh, I'll see you in the lobby.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.072
Well, come on, friends.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.412
Come on in. Don't push.

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:47.081
There you go. Welcome to my home.

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:50.001
- I'm so proud of you.
- Oh.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.587
Wow! What are you doing here?

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.585
I just wanted to say hello.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:57.793
It was my house, after all.

01:31:57.887 --> 01:32:03.302
I don't quite know how to say this,
but you don't have to be here.

01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:05.349
Like, I'm good.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:06.847
Looking for Hannah Daniels.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:11.477
Okay. I'm Hannah Daniels.
Can I help you, officers?

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:16.187
Ma'am, you are under arrest for violating
the Georgia penal code 147-b.

01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:20.820
- What? What even is that?
- Public flatulence.

01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:23.777
Failure to register as
a sex offender within 30 days.

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:25.362
- Oh, Hannah.
- Oh, that's real?

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:29.826
Hannah, haven't I taught you
that a lady never offends sexually?

01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:31.125
I didn't. Shit.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.294
- Language!
- Sorry.

01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:37.458
Okay, y'all. Let's-let's go on inside.

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:45.803
I'll be here when you get back!

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.428
Bye, Hannah!

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:11.750
J used to wish I was never born j&

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:13.196
j now I don't 'cause I found you j

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.744
j it's really cool you like me too j

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.956
you don't need to be in character anymore.
You already told me you're 19.

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.793
- "Tons of pubes."
- I have tons of pubes, by the way.

01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:27.595
I don't like this kid.

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:32.019
- You're laughing.
- Sorry!

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:34.769
Cubed is my favorite way to eat meat.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.113
I have a great teeth whitening team
if you want to borrow them.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.532
- It's more than one guy?
- Yeah, it's a team.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:45.950
Well, all right.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:53.412
- That's bullshit, by the way.
- What?

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:56.461
You're good at a lot of things. I think.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.182
Oh.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.181
- Sorry.
- Yeah. You're messing this up.

01:34:13.857 --> 01:34:17.770
What's a good dildo shake position?

01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:20.102
Keep in mind this is
gonna be my Oscar clip, so...

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.091
- Yeah. "For your consideration."
- We want it... yeah.

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:23.901
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

01:34:23.992 --> 01:34:25.357
Well, most of her is gone.

01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:30.160
But it's good. It's nice.

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:32.284
It's good.
You know, she's not stuck anymore.

01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:33.581
Yeah.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:37.877
She's not all pent up anymore.
She's been relieved.

01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:41.001
- Just go away.
- Okay.

01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:43.879
I ook. I've cracked the code.

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:47.925
And I've changed your flight.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:50.428
You'll now take off at 4:00 P.M.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.224
You'll connect in Dallas.

01:34:56.566 --> 01:34:58.227
What the fuck is your problem?

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:01.526
- What's your problem?
- Sorry. We're so close.

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:04.070
What do you mean?
What's your problem?

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:07.274
Look, my uncle's friends with the da.
I talked to him.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:10.326
They're dropping all the charges.
No, they're not. Sorry.

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:14.782
Yeah, I think so. Maybe a little bounce.
This would be fun.

01:35:14.876 --> 01:35:16.832
- Okay.
- Who is this man?

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:25.463
Well, if you must create wind
from either the front or the back...

01:35:26.179 --> 01:35:27.385
If you must...

01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:29.303
If you must...

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.551
I ook.

01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:34.225
This is not me helping you, but you...
Would you stop?

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:36.974
Oh, what? I'm acting in the scene.

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.271
So good. I'm sorry.

01:35:38.358 --> 01:35:41.600
Yes. You and that word "dick."

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.234
Sorry. It's my fault.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:50.658
I guess I'll get
a fresh squeezed tangerine juice.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:51.985
Uh, but no pulp.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.787
I guess I'll just have
a cajun-spice bloody Mary,

01:35:54.874 --> 01:35:57.957
but don't crowd it up with all those
celery stalks and bullshit.

01:35:58.044 --> 01:36:00.376
I guess I'll just take
a green tea matcha latte,

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:01.623
but with cow milk!

01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:03.250
None of that vegan bullshit.

01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:07.710
Then I'll just get a mint
chocolate-chip milkshake, but no chips.

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.295
Then I'm getting a bikini wax at 3:00.

01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:13.974
Well, thank god.
I had a whisker rash for four days.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.346
I wasn't able to do campaign.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.644
Brian, can you start
closer to this camera?

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:20.437
I guess that'll never make the cut.

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:21.890
I don't think so.
