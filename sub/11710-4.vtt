eat all that?"

You want the driver,
that's your power club.

Now line it up,
you pull it back, slowly...

11:40.282 --> 11:43.119

that dude's head with it.

You know...you were right.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.637

spends a lot of money.

I'll see you later.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.183
Uh, hang on.

12:06.183 --> 12:10.604

your hair done?

Well, yeah.
It's a big expenditure.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.863
I'm going to Phillipe's,
where I always go.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.783
Hmm. And you get, what,
a two-color process,

12:21.783 --> 12:23.951
maybe a little
conditioning toner at the end?

12:23.951 --> 12:27.955
- Yes.
- And that plus tip
is how much?

12:27.955 --> 12:30.082
You can't put a price
on good hair color.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.710

Probably close to 200 bucks.

to Russell's advice?

13:10.372 --> 13:14.126
His longest relationship was
three lap dances in a row.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.922
You're pretty hypocritical,
spending all that money
on your hair.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.592
I can't color it myself.
I've been going to Phillipe
for years.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.469
Well, I played video games
long before I met you.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.722
Which is probably
why it took you so long
to meet me.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.184
Look, this isn't
just about my hair
or your game.

13:30.184 --> 13:35.147
It's about us
spending on ourselves
without talking to each other.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.691
You're right.
We need money for our wedding,

13:37.691 --> 13:39.526
our honeymoon,
and a flat screen TV.

13:39.526 --> 13:40.987
Exactly.
And how about this?

13:40.987 --> 13:46.450
To begin our new plan
of fiscal responsibility,
I will color my own hair.

13:46.450 --> 13:50.787
Okay, and I will
sell my video game system
to Russell

13:50.787 --> 13:51.914
for an outrageous profit.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.250
- It's fun working together!
- Yeah!

13:54.250 --> 13:58.462
All right.
I will go to the drugstore
and get my hair color kit.

looks better.

I'll tell you right now.
First one.

Jeff, you could at least
pretend to care.

No, no, no.

do anything special
for our anniversary.

to be fun for both of us,

- Yup.
