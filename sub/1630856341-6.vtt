13:25.583 --> 13:28.750
I thought I saw a tooth, waiting to smile.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.250
C'mon, Keila, we can talk
and walk at the same time.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.458
Listen, Bruce.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.291
You and I are finishing our job.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.041
We're neither friends nor colleagues.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.583
So we don't have to pretend
we want to get coffee together.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.250
Or send each other Christmas cards.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.583
And we don't have to talk as we walk.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.666
So once this job is done, ciao.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.958
Well, I won't keep quiet.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.708
I don't know what to say now.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.541
She's fucking with my head.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.583
[sighs] I better shut up.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.666
[engine running]

14:10.000 --> 14:11.125
Okay, stop!

14:11.625 --> 14:12.750
[engine turns off]

14:18.041 --> 14:21.125
You handle the interior decorating.
I'll handle the gardening.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.625
[clicks]

14:43.000 --> 14:44.458
[drill whirs]

15:19.250 --> 15:20.375
[Damián sniffles]

15:21.958 --> 15:24.125
- Do you need any help?
- No, I'm fine.

15:26.541 --> 15:27.875
I'll take a look around.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.208
[dog barking in distance]

15:34.375 --> 15:36.375
[energetic music fades]

15:48.666 --> 15:51.166
[menacing string music playing]

15:58.125 --> 16:01.791
[Camille, echoing] <i>I had decided
to leave my husband and live with you.</i>

16:02.291 --> 16:04.916
<i>I know that François is a good person.</i>

16:06.125 --> 16:08.541
- [knocking on door]
- [music subsides]

16:09.500 --> 16:10.750
Good evening, sir.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.125
If you have any idea of
how long you wish to stay,

16:13.125 --> 16:15.000
kindly keep me posted.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.708
I've decided to stay indefinitely.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.041
- Thank you.
- Of course.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.083
Would you like me
to send you housekeeping?

16:20.083 --> 16:22.041
If you'd like to change your sheets?

16:22.041 --> 16:24.541
You've left the "do not disturb"
for some time now.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.583
I appreciate your concern,
but I'm busy working.

16:26.583 --> 16:27.500
[phone rings]

16:27.500 --> 16:30.125
If you'd excuse me,
I need to answer that call. Thanks.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.583
- [sighs]
- [call connects]

16:33.583 --> 16:36.458
[Roi] <i>Sir, the police search operation
is ongoing all around Paris.</i>

16:36.458 --> 16:38.666
- Roadblocks everywhere.
- [tense music playing]

16:38.666 --> 16:41.166
Damián decided to stop
at a camping site for three days

16:41.166 --> 16:42.791
and wait for things to cool down a bit.

16:42.791 --> 16:45.916
- It's the right decision.
<i>- Are you already on the way to Madrid?</i>

16:46.833 --> 16:47.833
No.

16:48.958 --> 16:52.041
- You're in Paris?
- Yes. There's no need to worry about me.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.041
There's something you need to know.
We have a loose end.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.916
<i>It's my fault. I held onto
the Eleanor of Avignon necklace.</i>

16:58.916 --> 17:00.791
I had it with me
when I went out last night.

17:00.791 --> 17:03.000
<i>I stole a car
and ended up in a street race.</i>

17:03.000 --> 17:04.541
So where is the jewel now, Roi?

17:07.833 --> 17:09.208
I lost the car, sir.

17:10.708 --> 17:12.250
The necklace was inside.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.166
Right now, it must be somewhere in Paris.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.250
[tense music continues]

17:19.250 --> 17:20.666
[engine revs]

17:26.166 --> 17:27.750
[officer] Out of the car. Now!

17:29.166 --> 17:30.958
[tense music fades]

17:30.958 --> 17:33.541
[somber piano music playing]

17:33.541 --> 17:35.125
I've put us all in danger.

17:36.416 --> 17:39.208
If you want me to disappear,
I will, and I will give up my share.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.541
I'm aware my mistake is unforgivable.

17:41.541 --> 17:43.291
<i>Yes, it</i> is <i>unforgivable.</i>

17:43.291 --> 17:47.208
And typical of a brainless moron
who doesn't understand the game.

17:51.291 --> 17:52.875
Why did you do it, Roi?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
I was mad.

17:58.541 --> 18:00.166
I was angry about how you treated me.

18:02.791 --> 18:05.166
It really hurt
when you treated me like a dog.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.208
I wanted to be my old self again.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.791
You know, I would say
that there are two good things

18:11.791 --> 18:13.833
that've come from this mess
you've gotten us into.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.625
<i>The first is that the necklace</i>

18:15.625 --> 18:18.291
<i>is in the hands
of some illegal street racers.</i>

18:18.291 --> 18:22.250
Not the kind of people
who would simply take the jewels

18:22.250 --> 18:24.125
to the police
to help in their investigation.

18:24.125 --> 18:28.583
And second, and most important,
Roi, is that you have shown pride<i>.</i>

18:29.291 --> 18:31.833
<i>And dignity. And balls.</i>

18:31.833 --> 18:35.000
<i>You had the courage to stand up
against the man who humiliated you.</i>

18:39.083 --> 18:40.291
I'm sorry too, Roi.

18:40.291 --> 18:41.541
<i>Forgive me.</i>

18:42.583 --> 18:44.958
You see, I was... confused.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.125
I was hurt, and that's
why I insulted Damián and I insulted you.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.166
<i>- Who hurt</i> you<i>?
- </i>  Camille.

18:50.166 --> 18:52.458
She had decided that she would be with me.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.583
<i>And just when she was going
to tell that fool Polignac, well,</i>

18:55.583 --> 18:56.916
he wasn't there.

18:56.916 --> 18:58.416
Because we had him arrested.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.125
We were too eager to have him framed.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.208
<i>You're right.</i>

19:02.208 --> 19:04.208
And now I can't even kill him.

19:04.833 --> 19:07.750
<i>Can't make him disappear
from the face of the earth.</i>

19:07.750 --> 19:09.875
He's under lock and key, the bastard.

19:09.875 --> 19:13.500
And what's worse now is that Camille says
she can no longer leave him

19:13.500 --> 19:15.125
and run away with me.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.833
She believes he's innocent?

19:16.833 --> 19:20.000
She thinks that he's a good person.
That he's so wonderful.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.083
We've put him on a pedestal, Roi.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.583
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

19:23.583 --> 19:24.500
What'll you do?

19:24.500 --> 19:27.458
New strategy. Camille likes good people.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.541
So be it.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.916
<i>Now that her bank accounts
have been frozen,</i>

19:30.916 --> 19:32.875
<i>I'm gonna throw
a load of cash in front of her</i>

19:32.875 --> 19:35.625
so that she can hire
the best criminal lawyer in Paris.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.083
<i>I'll be like the Gandhi of France.</i>

19:38.083 --> 19:40.791
<i>And once he's released,
she'll leave him, and...</i>

19:41.500 --> 19:43.958
And then she'll choose me. [laughs]

19:43.958 --> 19:45.250
That's a lot of money.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.416
To help you pay the best lawyer in Paris.

19:47.416 --> 19:50.291
I know your accounts are frozen,
so you'll need cash.

19:50.291 --> 19:53.250
Any other man would be happy
to see my husband in jail.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.833
Like having your opponent
taken out of the game, I suppose.

19:57.416 --> 19:58.583
But you want to help.

19:59.541 --> 20:02.458
Simón, are you an angel sent from heaven?

20:03.333 --> 20:06.875
Don't get me wrong.
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.208
[energetic music playing]

20:08.208 --> 20:10.375
I have a code of honor.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.041
And I would never consider
kicking a man when he's down.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.500
I'd like you to come
with me to visit François.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.375
Mm, Camille...

20:24.166 --> 20:25.958
I'll follow you wherever you go.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.791
[energetic music fades]

20:28.791 --> 20:30.125
[Bruce sighs]

20:30.125 --> 20:32.291
[insects buzzing]

20:34.708 --> 20:35.750
[Bruce exhales]

20:36.500 --> 20:37.333
Are you done?

20:38.208 --> 20:39.041
Sleeping outside?

20:39.041 --> 20:41.458
Yeah, I have a feeling
you'll be more comfortable with that.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.583
That's true.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.541
[somber music playing]

20:56.708 --> 21:00.250
- Where are the rest of the jewels?
- What are you talking about?

21:00.250 --> 21:04.041
I don't know anything about any jewels.
I never saw that necklace before.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.583
Then what was it doing in your car?

21:05.583 --> 21:08.000
[siren wailing]

21:08.000 --> 21:10.458
- It's not my car. I told you.
- [Lavelle] I know that.

21:10.458 --> 21:13.125
The owner reported
the car stolen last night.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.875
Just when someone pulled a score

21:14.875 --> 21:16.916
and made off with
a priceless set of jewels.

21:16.916 --> 21:23.083
So you see, what I really wanna know is,
how did this necklace end up in this car?

21:23.083 --> 21:27.666
I didn't even know the car was stolen.
I won it from some guy at a race.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.333
Okay. Let's assume
that what you said is true.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.583
Imagine that you just pulled the score
of the century.

21:34.583 --> 21:37.291
Would you then go drag racing
with the goods?

21:37.291 --> 21:40.750
And forget a necklace
in the back seat worth four million euros?

21:42.916 --> 21:44.791
It's not just about the race.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.791
The girls are riding on top of the car.

21:47.791 --> 21:49.875
The race is all about the adrenaline.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.416
Maybe these two just wanted
to have some thrills after their score.

21:53.416 --> 21:56.375
Find them, and you can ask them.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.833
What did these two people look like?

22:00.416 --> 22:02.291
I'd say around 23.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.708
She was a brunette, long hair.

22:04.708 --> 22:07.708
And the guy,
he had a glove on his left hand.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.958
A driving glove. Black.

22:09.958 --> 22:13.041
Did you notice any scars
or tattoos or anything different?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.333
He had a tattoo on his right hand.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.791
It looked like, uh... deer antlers.

22:18.791 --> 22:20.083
Something like that.

22:20.583 --> 22:23.083
- French?
- No. They were foreigners.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.416
- Are you sure?
- I used to live in Spain.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.833
My guess, they're Spanish.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.708
I swear on my mother. [kisses]

22:30.708 --> 22:31.958
[tense music playing]

22:36.958 --> 22:38.041
[intercom beeps]

22:38.041 --> 22:39.666
Get me Europol Spain.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.750
[door opens, closes]

22:44.750 --> 22:47.000
- What's up with him?
- [Cameron] He's heartbroken.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.916
A long story. [sighs]

22:54.583 --> 22:56.041
- Roi?
- Mm-hmm?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.583
I just wanted to say...

22:59.125 --> 23:00.750
thank you for covering for me again.

23:01.708 --> 23:05.583
I heard you talking with Berlin
on the phone about the necklace.

23:07.291 --> 23:08.666
That's another one you owe me.

23:08.666 --> 23:09.666
[scoffs]

23:10.166 --> 23:13.125
And the next time,
you'll tell me why you joined our crew.

23:14.875 --> 23:16.208
And how you know Berlin.

23:16.916 --> 23:18.250
- It's a deal.
- [Roi chuckles]

23:19.000 --> 23:20.666
[Cameron laughs]

23:20.666 --> 23:21.791
[Roi] Promise?

23:27.708 --> 23:29.750
[Cameron sighs]

23:29.750 --> 23:31.625
[gentle music playing]

23:33.083 --> 23:33.958
I promise.

23:34.541 --> 23:35.708
[chuckles softly]

23:35.708 --> 23:37.583
[sighs]

23:49.916 --> 23:51.166
Good night.

23:53.583 --> 23:54.583
[Cameron sighs]

23:56.750 --> 23:58.041
[exhales deeply]

23:58.041 --> 23:59.250
[softly] Sweet dreams.

- [rain pattering on tent]

24:03.041 --> 24:04.041
Bruce?

24:06.041 --> 24:08.416
It's raining really hard.
Are you all right?

24:08.416 --> 24:11.000
[Bruce] I'm fine.
Don't worry. It's clearing up.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.791
[Keila] You're completely soaked!

24:24.791 --> 24:26.583
Come in. We're being stupid.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.458
- No way. I don't wanna go in. I'm fine.
- Bruce, come in!

24:29.458 --> 24:32.125
If you catch pneumonia,
we'll never get the jewels out of France.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.250
Be professional.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.291
You're right. [grunts]

24:35.291 --> 24:36.291
Quickly!

24:41.250 --> 24:42.625
[thunder rumbles]

24:45.458 --> 24:47.041

You're right. I'm soaked.

26:38.291 --> 26:39.541
[woman speaks French]

26:39.541 --> 26:40.791
Sorry?

26:42.250 --> 26:43.833
I was asking if you are okay.

26:45.041 --> 26:47.291
My wife, she, um... Uh...

26:47.291 --> 26:50.916
She died three weeks ago,
and I'm finding it very hard.

26:51.875 --> 26:52.791
My condolences.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.333
Would you like to talk about it?

26:56.333 --> 26:57.791
Um... [sighs]

26:58.291 --> 26:59.416
[exhales]

26:59.416 --> 27:01.125
I'd say you're not ready yet.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.125
Let me get you something.

27:07.625 --> 27:08.875
[woman] Limoncello.

27:09.625 --> 27:11.541
It's a Sicilian recipe. I made it myself.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.041
Try it.

27:14.708 --> 27:16.000
You'll like it.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.666
[woman's footsteps fade]

It's almost two in the morning.

- Tell me.

28:43.708 --> 28:46.375
Well you see, I ran into this woman.

And, well, you know,
we've been talking all night, and...

- Ah.

28:52.291 --> 28:55.041
She made it... uh... Sicilian recipe.

28:55.541 --> 29:00.166

you'd reconsidered our separation?

<i>The last time on the phone,
I know we said a lot of things, and...</i>

29:04.125 --> 29:09.666
Well, I was thinking that you can't make
a decision just like that.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.500
Damián, it wasn't "just like that."

29:12.500 --> 29:13.666

to tell you that, well,

There's some really powerful chemistry

29:26.333 --> 29:29.458

I wanted to find out
if you're okay with this.

uh, how long is this hiatus?
