WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.775
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:08.842 --> 00:11.144
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:11.211 --> 00:12.679
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:13.747 --> 00:17.584
We're gonna mission
around all the party islands.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.721
(screaming)

00:21.788 --> 00:24.090
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.561
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:28.628 --> 00:31.131
Boat parties.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.732
Paint parties.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.168
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.570
More necking on.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.508
Oh, shit.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.077
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:45.745 --> 00:49.149
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:49.215 --> 00:51.584
Let's fucking do this.

00:52.585 --> 00:55.321
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:59.359 --> 01:01.428
Kick-offs.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.129
Marnie, Marnie!

01:05.165 --> 01:07.400
Drama.
Fuck off!

01:09.536 --> 01:11.171
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:11.237 --> 01:13.573
Let's get fucking mortal.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.911
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:19.879 --> 01:23.483
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:23.550 --> 01:25.785
Welcome to the pirate ship!

01:25.852 --> 01:29.689
Have I had too many sangrias,
or can I see Gaz kissing Chantelle?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.524
What?
Wanna be my girlfriend?

01:31.591 --> 01:33.960
What the hell?
We can't neck on any more.

01:34.027 --> 01:37.263
I shoulda told Aaron I was bisexual
when I had the chance.

01:37.330 --> 01:39.098
We're going to Ibiza!

01:39.165 --> 01:41.568
Ibiza, here we come!

01:41.634 --> 01:42.769
Oh, my God!

01:44.204 --> 01:47.240
Charlotte's bed's
not even fucking cold yet.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.144
We're in the club pulling
two wicked birds. I'm back.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.847
Marty's actually pulled a girl.
(screams)

01:55.515 --> 01:58.451
We can't go on as a couple
if he's not putting me first.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.487
You are not boyfriend material.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.622
We're not friends.
Not friends?

02:02.689 --> 02:05.325
She needs help.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.227
I am fucking done with her.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.965
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.300
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.437
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.772
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.141
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.177
I'm preened to perfection.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.613
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.581
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.617
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.719
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.121
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:49.569 --> 02:52.639
Well, it was until I found you
spooning us last night.

02:52.705 --> 02:56.409
Oh, here we go. Happy Holly has
finally got something to moan about.

02:56.476 --> 02:57.477
Shut up.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.046
Cos...

03:02.482 --> 03:05.885
Last night, finding out that Gary
and Chantelle kissed upset us.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.422
The fact Gary pulled so soon
after everything that's happened

03:09.489 --> 03:10.957
made it even worse.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.427
I feel like me and you
should be in the shag pad.

03:17.196 --> 03:20.166
All they talk about and care about
is fucking birds.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.603
And that's the last thing that I can
think of on my list I wanna do.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.639
Since we've been away,
I'm not feeling close to the boys.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.275
I love them,
but we don't have much in common.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.247
I had a wicked time
dusting this bird last night.

03:34.314 --> 03:37.584
Now it's time to get rid of these
girls and crack on with the day.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.824
Fucking hell.
Everything kicked off last night.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.227
What happened with you and Aaron?
Chloe was crying in my arms,

03:48.294 --> 03:50.363
so I walked over to Marty
and his girl,

03:50.430 --> 03:52.865
then Aaron came over
and got involved.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.868
I don't know why Aaron doesn't
let us just get on with it.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.705
If I've got a problem with Marty,
it's between us.

03:58.771 --> 04:02.041
It doesn't take a genius
to stay out of an argument.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.443
Yeah.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.647
Once again, last night,
me and Marnie were arguing

04:07.714 --> 04:09.382
over someone else's business.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.585
How can you reason with someone
that's unreasonable?

04:12.652 --> 04:14.654
So, boys, you had fun in the club?

04:16.856 --> 04:19.559
And it felt amazing.
I'm still smiling.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.495
Gary and Scott are both single
and they both shagged.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.565
I'm in a relationship and I
didn't get any sex last night.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.266
What the fuck is going on?

04:27.333 --> 04:30.703
No matter what I said last night...
I coulda said, "Nice dress."

04:30.770 --> 04:32.772
She woulda said, "What did you say?"

04:32.839 --> 04:34.841
"Fucking (indistinct)."
(laughter)

04:34.907 --> 04:38.344
Aaron, are you surprised Marnie's
kicking off? She's your bird.

04:38.411 --> 04:41.481
And that's just what birds do.
Since the dawn of birds.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.517
When Eve was booting off
with Adam over a fucking apple.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.490
I've woken up with a horrible
feeling that I drank too much.

04:50.556 --> 04:54.160
And I think I might have
fucked things up with Marty.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.962
Come here.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.699
I'm in such a bad position, man.
You're not.

04:59.766 --> 05:03.136
I feel so sorry for Chloe
and I hate seeing her upset.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.972
The Marty situation
is really fucking with her head.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.342
You're too good for him, but
you know what? He went to bed alone.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.944
Did he not go with the girl?
No. Why?

05:12.011 --> 05:15.381
I don't know. You tell me.
Obviously because he cares.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.650
Marty didn't bring
a girl back last night,

05:17.717 --> 05:19.819
that's the best news
I coulda woke up to,

05:19.886 --> 05:22.855
but I need to stop kicking off,
it's getting out of hand.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.963
It is time to leave Ibiza!

05:31.030 --> 05:33.566
And head back to Magaluf!

05:33.633 --> 05:36.769
Where we're all getting get fucked
off Anna cos we ran away.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.338
I can't wait.

05:39.405 --> 05:40.606
Scott's not ready.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.175
Scott, come on!

05:42.241 --> 05:43.743
Shut up, man. I'm coming!

05:43.810 --> 05:46.212
Shock horror,
everybody's ready, bar Scott.

05:47.413 --> 05:50.883
Scott, howay, man. Scott!
I'm shutting my fucking case!

05:50.950 --> 05:53.586
They shout at me
just cos I look after my things.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.489
I'm not like you, I'm not gonna
hide my shitty knickers

05:56.556 --> 05:58.458
next to my fucking eye mask.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.027
Howay! Come on, hurry up! Now

06:05.031 --> 06:08.334
We've arrived at the airport
and I can't wait to get on the plane

06:08.401 --> 06:12.271
cos I love turbulence, I love when
they move, it feels nice on my clit.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.878
Ibiza was pure fucking shit for me.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.947
But I'm so glad
to be back in Magaluf.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.648
In that wicked villa.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.726
Oh, yous, Anna's there.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.462
I don't wanna get out first,
you get out first.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.932
There's Anna. She looks like
she's got a fanny full of wasps.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.334
She's furious.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.803
Where the hell have yous been?
Ibiza.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.004
What?! Ibiza?!

06:45.071 --> 06:49.008
This is not a holiday. I'm not gonna
tolerate any slacking any more.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.778
It was nothing do with me,
I got forced into it.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.579
It was all Holly, I swear.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.982
Yous all know better
and yous all went.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.718
Anna is booting off
and spitting everywhere.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.419
Say it, don't spray it.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.255
Yous are gonna go back to work.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.224
You know that boat
you were partying on the other day?

07:05.291 --> 07:06.826
You're gonna go and clean it.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.562
Let's get back in the car!
Let's scrub some decks.

07:09.629 --> 07:12.331
Anna's saying we gotta go out
and clean the boat.

07:12.398 --> 07:16.803
Joke's on her cos I love boats
and I love cleaning.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.471
Fuck.

07:24.043 --> 07:26.412
We get to the harbour and fuck me,

07:26.479 --> 07:28.848
Jack Sparrow and his pal
are still there.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.017
Do these radge packets
live on the boat?

07:31.083 --> 07:33.486
Hello, pirates!

07:34.554 --> 07:37.323
The boat is a fucking shit tip.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.091
This is gonna be a nightmare.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.362
Eurgh. Eurgh! What the fuck?!

07:43.429 --> 07:45.565
Anna can fuck off. I'm hungover.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.335
And everyone knows Scott will
happily clean this boat for us.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.937
And he will fucking love it.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.773
Girls, start wiping the seats
and the thingies down,

07:53.840 --> 07:54.941
we'll do the floors.

07:55.007 --> 07:58.878
Scott expects me to clean?
I don't even clean my teeth.

08:02.348 --> 08:06.052
Why the fuck do we need to wash
the boat when it's in the water?

08:06.118 --> 08:09.255
Scott is in his absolute element
cleaning this boat.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.625
It's a good job we've got him,
cos no-one else is doing fuck all.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.995
(Chloe laughs)
Scott, man. Stop washing me!

08:18.164 --> 08:22.134
Right. I feel like we need to
talk about last night.

08:22.201 --> 08:25.238
What's more important than cleaning
is clearing the air,

08:25.304 --> 08:27.707
I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.676
I know you were upset
and angry about Charlotte,

08:30.743 --> 08:33.145
I'm moving on
and that's gonna involve

08:33.212 --> 08:35.982
decisions I'm gonna make
that people might not like.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.085
If you did fancy someone,
I would find that better

08:39.150 --> 08:41.921
than doing it for the banter.
That's disrespectful.

08:41.988 --> 08:45.258
Gary going on the pull after
everything that's happened,

08:45.324 --> 08:47.627
of course I'm not gonna be happy.

08:47.693 --> 08:51.731
Charlotte necking on with Marty
is the same as me and Chantelle.

08:51.797 --> 08:55.468
Everybody's like, "Gaz kissed
Chantelle. Poor Charlotte."

08:55.534 --> 08:59.038
It wasn't that when Charlotte kissed
Marty. I've got feelings too.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.807
You are here with your family.
She is the one...

09:01.874 --> 09:04.644
Do not put Charlotte not being here
on me. I do, sorry.

09:04.710 --> 09:08.247
Sorry, that's her choice. If she
wanted to be here, she'd be here.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.882
It's her choice, not mine.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.884
She ditched you as well as me.

09:11.951 --> 09:15.588
It's different to be in a situation
where I don't have a best friend.

09:15.655 --> 09:16.856
It's different for me.

09:16.923 --> 09:20.960
For one second, never think I do not
miss having that girl here. I do.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.562
I know it's hard
finding out I kissed Chantelle.

09:23.629 --> 09:24.997
And that I pulled in Ibiza,

09:25.064 --> 09:27.800
but I don't want things
to carry on being awkward.

09:27.867 --> 09:32.338
Me and you've been here the longest.
I want you to know I'm there for you.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.041
You can talk to us if you need
to talk to someone.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.642
Don't think you can't.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.812
I'm glad I've spoken to Gary.
I've already lost Charlotte

09:39.879 --> 09:41.881
and I don't wanna
lose him as a friend.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.686
The pirates are fucking dafties.
They've left the beer pump on.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.254
It's so clean in here.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.791
Oi, oi, Scotty T, seven pints
down the line. Cheers, mate.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.897
Let's go.
Here we go, howay.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.765
You know what? Fuck everyone.

09:59.832 --> 10:02.134
I've cleaned
this whole boat by myself

10:02.201 --> 10:06.973
I loved every minute of it, so
thank you, Anna. Thank you so much.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.942
I've done most of it,
but them fuckers have left it.

10:10.009 --> 10:12.345
Thank you very much.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.815
See you later, kid. Ah-har.

10:27.426 --> 10:31.163
It's to get out of these minging
shorts and put wicked clothes on

10:31.230 --> 10:34.433
cos we're going out.
Tonight is gonna be waxer.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.140
Me.
You'll bottle it.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.342
Fucking right,
I'll get my head smashed.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.644
Scott. I'm brave,
but I'm not that brave.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.813
If I pulled
it would be World War Three.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.850
You need to straighten it out.
Say what's happening.

10:50.916 --> 10:54.520
At the minute, you're upset.
I want a good night.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.188
That means not talking to her.

10:56.255 --> 10:59.959
Aaron's telling me he's gonna go
out, not talk to his bird all night

11:00.026 --> 11:03.963
and not go on the pull.
What could possibly go wrong?

11:04.030 --> 11:06.966
Right, boys. I'm just gonna
tell you this now,

11:07.033 --> 11:10.569
there's no other way to tell yous.
I'm gonna move to the girl's room.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.773
Don't take offence.
It's not for an offensive reason.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.776
Nathan says he's moving room.
Have you lost the plot?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.044
Why are you leaving?

11:18.110 --> 11:20.980
Nathan, I'm not being funny,
you're one of the lads...

11:21.047 --> 11:23.015
Like I said,
it's no offence to yous.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.285
It's something I wanna do.
It's not that I don't like the lads.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.322
But after Ibiza, I've come closer
to the girls. I can be myself.

11:30.389 --> 11:34.326
Is it because like, obviously,
we're talking about banging birds,

11:34.393 --> 11:36.862
you can fit in more
with their conversations

11:36.929 --> 11:38.597
rather than ours?
Yeah.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.467
Nathan can't get involved
cos we talk about banging,

11:41.534 --> 11:43.969
well talk about banging lads.
Bring a lad back.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.439
Bang him all hour,
I'll fucking bang you.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.240
Is there anything we can do?

11:48.307 --> 11:50.743
I don't want to feel like
you're not involved.

11:50.810 --> 11:54.847
You've always stayed in the lad's
room. I'm just moving rooms.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.586
I've managed to explain to the boys
and they've got my back.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.522
Look at yous,
kicking me out already!

12:03.589 --> 12:06.826
Adios, boys. Hola, chicas.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.962
What the fuck is that?
Hi, roomies.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.565
(cheering)

12:12.631 --> 12:14.133
I'm here.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.969
I do hope Nathan knows
what he's getting himself in to

12:17.036 --> 12:19.638
moving to the girls room,
cos we live like pigs.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.774
And he probably will catch a disease.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.843
Chloe, have you spoken
to Marty today?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.878
Nah.
Are you gonna? Dunno.

12:25.945 --> 12:29.048
I don't think you should.
I don't want you to ruin tonight.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.983
If you get drunk,
you will kick off.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.252
I'm not drinking tonight!

12:33.319 --> 12:36.655
Come on, man. Why don't you
believe us? I never kick off.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.758
What's happening with Aaron?
I dunno, we haven't spoken.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.928
I wish you'd sort your shit out.
I'm not gonna say anything,

12:42.995 --> 12:45.664
I'm gonna have a good night.
I won't speak to him.

12:45.731 --> 12:49.168
Me and the girls really want to
celebrate Nathan being with us.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.738
If that means staying away from
Aaron, that's what I gotta do.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.840
Girls, you ready? Nathan?
Yeah.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.009
Everyone's ready and we look wicked.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.346
It's time to hit Magaluf harder
than we've ever hit it before.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.384
Let's get fucking mortal.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.453
Where the fuck did this come from?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.723
It's not how you treat a girl.
It's starting to piss us off.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.558
What the actual fuck?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.227
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:16.996 --> 13:17.196
.

13:19.732 --> 13:19.932
.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.868
'Listen up, this part
contains more strong language,

13:22.935 --> 13:25.337
aggressive behaviour.
And plenty of nudity,

13:25.404 --> 13:29.074
so if you're easily offended,
you know what to do. Stop watching.'

13:37.283 --> 13:39.718
We get in to Project
and the place is bouncing.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.387
I am buzzing.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.227
This is pure mint.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.029
Let's go and get fucking mortal.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.302
So, Nathan's left
the boys room, has he?

13:56.368 --> 14:01.640
And he's never gonna see this coming
out of the shower ever again.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.043
Where the fuck did this come from?

14:04.109 --> 14:05.945
I was just trying to enjoy my night

14:06.011 --> 14:08.547
and now I've got
both your dicks in my face.

14:11.884 --> 14:15.588
I'm not saying I'm enjoying this,
but a lap dance is a lap dance.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.370
The Marnie situation
is getting to us.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.840
I thought asking her to be my
girlfriend would be a good decision,

14:34.907 --> 14:37.109
it's turned out to be a nightmare.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.454
Maybe Gary's right,
I should talk to Marnie.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.725
This isn't the time or the place and
I don't wanna ruin everyone's night.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.760
So, I'm just gonna leave it.

14:58.364 --> 15:02.735
I'm having a wicked night, but after
what happened it's time to apologise.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.947
It's so nice
to hear Chloe apologise.

15:20.586 --> 15:24.456
Marty's being really sweet. It makes
us think something could happen.

15:24.523 --> 15:27.993
I just need to make sure
I do not kick off.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.169
I'm hoping that me and Chloe
can get on as friends now

15:37.236 --> 15:41.674
cos nowt is gonna happen with us. I
cannot be arsed with the kick-offs.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.180
I just don't get it.

15:48.247 --> 15:52.284
When a boyfriend and girlfriend
fall out, the man should make up.

15:52.351 --> 15:55.888
Aaron's just standing at the bar
quiet and not speaking to us

15:55.954 --> 15:57.690
like some sort of fucking wimp.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.201
I expected, when Aaron asked us
to be his girlfriend

16:09.268 --> 16:13.105
it would totally change, but I
feel like we're in the same place.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.746
I dunno what it is,
but Holly loves flirting with me.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.549
I wish she could accept
the fact I've banged her

16:23.615 --> 16:25.517
and let us have a go again.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.324
Where the fuck
has this even came from?

16:37.930 --> 16:42.801
I will never, and I repeat,
never, ever, ever, ever

16:42.868 --> 16:45.104
in a million years
go back there with you.

16:53.612 --> 16:56.048
Scott's all over me now. Give over.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.951
There's no way I'd go
anywhere near you again.

17:09.728 --> 17:13.464
I'm having a really good night,
but I'm still waiting for Aaron.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.300
I'm getting nothing from him.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.037
This is ridiculous. Maybe if I speak
to Scott I can get a lad's view.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.649
Marnie, give the kid a break.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.519
Everyone can see when it comes
to cutting himself in,

17:33.585 --> 17:36.688
he knows what to do. But when
it comes to being a boyfriend,

17:36.755 --> 17:38.424
he doesn't have a fucking clue.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.563
Not being in a relationship
for two years is no excuse

17:44.630 --> 17:46.665
to not speak to us all day.

17:46.732 --> 17:51.370
It's not how you treat a girl. I'm
really starting to get pissed off.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.741
I know I said
I wasn't gonna drink tonight,

17:55.808 --> 17:59.111
but by accident,
I'm kinda fucking mortal.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.382
(laughter)

18:03.449 --> 18:06.452
Tonight is pure bouncing.
I am fucked.

18:07.453 --> 18:12.057
If Aaron isn't gonna give me the
attention, I'll go somewhere else.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.460
Chloe, get your arse here.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.996
Marnie hasn't spoken to us all
night, now she's all over Chloe.

18:18.063 --> 18:21.800
I feel like she's making a mug
out of us. What's she playing at?

18:21.867 --> 18:25.037
It's so frustrating.
How can he just stand there

18:25.103 --> 18:28.106
and not come and speak to us?
What's wrong with him?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.977
I know what she's trying to do,
I won't bite.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.146
The last thing I want
is another fight.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.117
I've done everything
to get Aaron's attention.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.253
He hasn't come anywhere near us.

18:41.320 --> 18:45.691
I'm drunk, pissed off and I can
think of one way for him to notice.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.733
What the actual fuck?
That tart has just swilled us.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.735
And I hate being swilled.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.741
Marnie's just swilled Aaron
for no reason.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.811
Fucking foaming.
He needs to fuck her clean off.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.116
All of a sudden,
Aaron's wearing Marnie's drink.

19:11.183 --> 19:14.520
Why the fuck
is there always drama in Maga?

19:14.586 --> 19:16.388
Fuck this, we need to get home now.

19:25.531 --> 19:29.735
I will never, ever, ever
talk to that girl again.

19:29.801 --> 19:33.238
This is by far the worst
relationship I've ever been in.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.439
It's a fucking mess.

19:34.506 --> 19:38.243
The worse thing is we don't even
have arguments. He's not man enough.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.413
I'm not even acknowledging
that Aaron exists.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.453
No, Chloe.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.055
Inside.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.758
Well, surprise, surprise,
we get back to the villa

19:52.824 --> 19:57.229
and Chloe can't even wait 30 seconds
to use a functioning toilet.

19:57.296 --> 20:00.966
I'm sorry, but when nature calls,
Chloe answers.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.303
Hello, nature? Is it all right
if I go for a piss?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.904
All right. Cheers. Sound.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.879
We get back to the villa
and before things escalate,

20:13.946 --> 20:16.648
Aaron and Marty get upstairs
and don't say a peep.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.286
I'm absolutely sick
of everyone moaning,

20:21.353 --> 20:23.388
whinging and just kicking off.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.692
I'm off to clear me head and sleep
with Holly in the shag pad.

20:26.758 --> 20:30.128
I'm not risking getting involved in
anything, I'm going to bed.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.798
Even if it means
sleeping next to Scott.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.907
I am pure mangled me, like.
I'm in a bad way.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.144
Are you in a bad way?

20:46.211 --> 20:49.348
Piss in the toilet.
Listen, Gaz, I'm in a bad way.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.850
Gaz, you need to help me out, like.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.986
Right, boys. Bed. Let's go.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.887
No more kick-offs.
Tomorrow.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.856
Tomorrow I will do something wrong.

20:57.923 --> 21:01.927
Once again, a day being Marnie's
boyfriend has resulted in a row

21:01.994 --> 21:05.597
and me going to bed alone.
This relationship is fucked.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.802
Marnie's had a shit night with Aaron.

21:10.869 --> 21:14.139
What she needs to do
is have some fun and get over him.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.442
Get your clothes off, bitch.
And let's get in that pool.

21:24.883 --> 21:27.786
This is what I needed.
I might have had a shit night,

21:27.853 --> 21:30.722
but at least I've got
Chloe and Nathan.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.667
I'm eventually trying
to get some sleep,

21:41.733 --> 21:43.735
but what the fuck is that?

21:45.871 --> 21:47.372
What the fuck?

21:47.439 --> 21:50.442
It's a moth the size of a pigeon
and it's freaking me out.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.110
There, man.
Shit.

21:54.713 --> 21:57.282
How am I meant to sleep
with that in the room?

21:57.349 --> 21:59.184
Gaz, I'm getting into bed with you.

22:00.519 --> 22:04.056
Skinny dipping was a great end
to a shit day.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.691
Things have gotten worse.

22:05.757 --> 22:09.728
This is the worst relationship
I've ever been in.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.998
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.133
I will never talk to her again.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.169
I'm over this whole situation.

22:17.235 --> 22:18.904
Whoo!

22:18.970 --> 22:21.707
I don't feel too good here, like.
(throws up)

22:21.773 --> 22:23.709
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

22:26.478 --> 22:26.678
.

22:29.214 --> 22:29.414
.

22:29.481 --> 22:33.218
'Alreet? The bad language and
sexual scenes continue in this part.'

22:33.285 --> 22:35.387
'You have been warned.'

22:44.496 --> 22:45.497
I had a good night.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.400
I've woke up this morning
and I don't feel depressed.

22:48.467 --> 22:51.536
Cos I haven't kicked off.
This is incredible.

22:51.603 --> 22:55.707
Chloe has lasted a full night
without kicking off.

22:55.774 --> 22:56.808
Is she all right?

23:00.879 --> 23:04.850
There's only one way to welcome
Nathan in my scruffy manor.

23:04.916 --> 23:09.454
(farts, laughter)

23:09.521 --> 23:13.024
I swear to God, you have not
just farted in my face.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.861
Chloe, you are
a fucking little troll.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.629
That's disgusting.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.865
Wakey, wakey, Nathan.

23:19.931 --> 23:22.701
Welcome to the girls' room
you little radge packet.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.936
Cock-a-doodle-do, Nathan.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.239
In a bad place
you and Aaron, aren't you?

23:27.305 --> 23:30.142
You don't look like
boyfriend and girlfriend.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.544
We haven't spoke
for about 48 hours now.

23:32.611 --> 23:35.147
Aaron and Marnie argue all the time.

23:35.213 --> 23:39.518
And they don't even have make-up
sex, what is the fucking point?

23:39.584 --> 23:41.653
What are you gonna do now
about Aaron?

23:41.720 --> 23:45.157
I'm literally gonna walk around
and pretend he's not there.

23:45.223 --> 23:46.925
Like what he did last night.

23:46.992 --> 23:49.761
Me and Aaron clearly
aren't getting on at the minute.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.931
The best thing I can do
is just stay well away from him.

23:57.469 --> 23:59.538
Morning.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.841
This is the most hungover
I've been in my life.

24:02.908 --> 24:07.279
Yeah, I mean, I think everyone
last night wasn't planning on that.

24:07.345 --> 24:10.015
As far as me and Marnie
are concerned, I will never,

24:10.081 --> 24:11.383
ever talk to her again.

24:11.449 --> 24:15.220
If she doesn't realise we're over
by me not talking, she never will.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.223
Why would I wanna be with someone
that treats us shit?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.958
I've over this whole situation.

24:27.065 --> 24:30.869
I'm doing some squats
and I hear the phone ring, ring.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.237
(phone rings)

24:32.304 --> 24:33.605
Hello?!

24:34.506 --> 24:36.041
Hi. Hi, Anna. You all right?

24:36.107 --> 24:37.843
"Hello, it's Anna."

24:45.350 --> 24:46.852
Oh, OK, Anna.

24:46.918 --> 24:50.555
Me, Nathan and Marnie are going
to work? That old chestnut.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.592
What?

24:59.364 --> 25:00.932
Kavos?!

25:00.999 --> 25:04.336
(screaming) Anna! Kisses!

25:04.402 --> 25:07.606
I can't believe we're going to Kavos.
It sounds wicked.

25:07.672 --> 25:08.807
But where is it?

25:11.243 --> 25:13.144
OK. Love you. Love you so much.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.614
"See you. Bye."
Bye.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.182
Everyone!

25:17.249 --> 25:20.218
I need to tell all these little
radgies the good news

25:20.285 --> 25:21.386
and the bad news.

25:21.453 --> 25:22.454
Well, tell us then.

25:22.520 --> 25:27.626
Right. The bad news first. Me, Marnie
and Nathan are working today.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.227
(laughter)

25:29.294 --> 25:32.297
For fuck's sake, Anna.
You know I hate work.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.299
Why do you send me every time?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.202
But this is the good news,
everyone brace yourselves.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.437
Tomorrow, we're going to Kavos!

25:39.504 --> 25:40.772
(Marty screams)

25:40.839 --> 25:43.708
I've never been to Kavos,
but I've heard it's scruffy.

25:43.775 --> 25:46.845
Saying that, I love scruffy places.
Bring it on.

25:46.912 --> 25:49.481
My arsehole is cleaner than Kavos.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.016
Well, I'm buzzing about it.

25:51.082 --> 25:54.252
Magaluf hasn't been the best.
We've had more downs than ups.

25:54.319 --> 25:55.887
Kavos can't get any worse.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.857
After last night, we need
to do something. Water park?

25:58.924 --> 26:01.960
I was just thinking chillies.
I'm fucking knackered.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.495
I'm fucking shattered.

26:03.561 --> 26:07.132
And there's no way I'm leaving
this villa. So you can crack on.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.533
Cos I'm gonna kip.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.638
I hope the water park is closed.

26:25.550 --> 26:28.386
I'm not gonna lie,
I love a water park, me.

26:28.453 --> 26:31.089
I'm buzzing, me.
So am I. We could be at work.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.236
It's wicked being at the water park,

26:45.303 --> 26:48.173
having a nice fun day with no shit.

26:50.875 --> 26:55.013
So far, Anna has been
giving us mint jobs.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.282
Oh, fuck off.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.919
Flyering for a party
we can't even go to?

27:00.986 --> 27:04.289
In my eyes,
she is now a devil bitch

27:04.356 --> 27:06.057
and I fucking hate her.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.293
Does anyone know how to use this?
Yeah.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.928
Turn it on at the bottom.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.964
I'm not the loudest person,
so I need this to help us out

27:13.031 --> 27:15.000
so these people
know what I'm saying.

27:15.066 --> 27:17.469
Shut up and get to work!

27:17.535 --> 27:18.937
I'm your boss!

27:19.004 --> 27:21.840
Chloe's voice
is annoying on its own.

27:21.906 --> 27:26.177
And the fact she has a megaphone
has turned it up to unbearable.

27:26.244 --> 27:29.014
Oi, you in the red shorts!
Give us your digits.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.915
Sexy.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.820
Hello, boys.
Hi, guys.

27:35.887 --> 27:40.358
Do yous wanna come to a pool party
tomorrow? Here at nine o'clock.

27:40.425 --> 27:42.127
Whoo!

27:42.193 --> 27:44.329
Work has been mint
so far on this trip,

27:44.396 --> 27:48.199
but today it's absolutely shit.
I'm walking around like a freak,

27:48.266 --> 27:52.704
telling them about a pool party
I can't go to. Pool party!

27:52.771 --> 27:54.005
Hello!

27:54.072 --> 27:56.341
Where is it?
Here!

27:56.408 --> 27:58.777
Thank fuck that Chloe's at work.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.446
Me and Marnie would never
have done that.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.015
Right, work's shit. I want a drink.

28:04.082 --> 28:06.885
Fuck this.
I'm bored of this shit.

28:06.951 --> 28:10.855
Pool party tomorrow!
See you all there, you radgies.

28:15.593 --> 28:19.130
What's going on with Aaron? Cos last
night you threw a drink at him.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.698
I feel like a fucking idiot.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.935
Now I feel like I've lost him
as a friend as well.

28:24.002 --> 28:27.772
When you get into a relationship,
it's supposed to be exciting,

28:27.839 --> 28:30.742
but me and Aaron have gone wrong.
It's getting us down.

28:30.809 --> 28:34.279
I'm closer to you than Aaron.
I treat you more like a girlfriend.

28:34.345 --> 28:38.650
And that's saying something. I've
probably kissed you more times.

28:38.716 --> 28:41.519
It's not right and I think
you need a big chat.

28:41.586 --> 28:45.323
I just think you that you need to be
honest and tell him you're bisexual.

28:45.390 --> 28:49.527
No. Because it's totally irrelevant.
You need to be honest.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.697
Keeping a secret from your
boyfriend isn't right.

28:52.764 --> 28:56.601
If Marnie speaks to Aaron later,
she needs to tell him the truth.

29:04.008 --> 29:05.043
Whoo!

29:09.080 --> 29:12.183
I thought that being in the water
park would change my mood,

29:12.250 --> 29:15.720
but it hasn't. I'm still foaming
that Marnie threw a drink over us.

29:26.798 --> 29:28.133
Aaron, you've been limp.

29:28.199 --> 29:31.302
Unless you tell her she's finished,
you're still a couple.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.204
It's as simple as that.

29:40.411 --> 29:44.015
I asked her to be my girlfriend
cos I wanna be more than friends.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.684
Since we got in a relationship,
it hasn't worked.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.153
That makes me feel shit.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.924
Aaron's feeling low,
we're meant to enjoy ourselves.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.627
Get back on that slide!

29:55.693 --> 29:57.529
That ride is pure rapid

29:57.595 --> 30:01.599
and after a heavy night
on the sauce, I'm in a bad way.

30:01.666 --> 30:04.002
I don't feel too good here, like.

30:04.068 --> 30:06.938
(throws up)

30:07.005 --> 30:11.543
Marty, you've got a whole water park
and you throw up in front of me?

30:11.609 --> 30:12.877
Thanks very much.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.983
There's no way I'm going near
a drink tonight, like.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.886
I need to stay in and recover,
cos I feel fucked.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.693
Work's been shit, as usual,

30:28.760 --> 30:32.463
but tonight is our last night,
so I'm gonna make sure I have fun.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.869
I can't believe it's the last night.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.104
Tonight, we need to go out
with a bang.

30:48.413 --> 30:51.416
If there was someone nice,
I would, but there never is.

30:51.482 --> 30:52.817
Chloe, what about you?

30:52.884 --> 30:54.552
Nah.
Good girl.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.525
I'm honestly not interested
in any other boy.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.894
The only person
I'm interested in is Marty

31:02.961 --> 31:04.862
and I hope something happens.

31:04.929 --> 31:07.799
Marn, have you spoke to Aaron today?
Nah.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.867
But if he speaks to you...
Yeah.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.769
...then you're gonna speak?
Yeah.

31:11.836 --> 31:15.807
I hope to God Aaron speaks to us.
I can't go another day of silence.

31:15.873 --> 31:18.376
But it's always me
who has to move things on.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.812
He needs to come to me.
I'm not going to him.

31:20.878 --> 31:23.848
Right, everyone,
we're gonna have a belter night.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.218
We're gonna dance like radgies,
or dance like Chantelle...

31:27.285 --> 31:29.120
Or you can dance like me.

31:29.187 --> 31:32.423
I'm excited for Kavos tomorrow.
Whoo! Cheers!

31:34.359 --> 31:36.561
Oh, yeah. The corpse.

31:36.628 --> 31:39.264
Walk in to Scott's room
and it looks like he's been

31:39.330 --> 31:41.599
pulled through a hedge backwards.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.201
(both) SCOTT!

31:44.202 --> 31:45.803
Who the fuck is that, man?

31:45.870 --> 31:48.139
We're going out.
Fuck that.

31:48.206 --> 31:49.540
What?
Feel proper ill.

31:49.607 --> 31:51.376
Still in last night's clothes.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.845
I love a night out,
but I'm knackered,

31:53.911 --> 31:57.548
I'm sweating my tits off and
I cannot get out of bed. Liberty.

32:01.185 --> 32:04.289
Unless you bring one back for me.
I'll try.

32:04.355 --> 32:07.692
It's our last night, Scott's not
coming out cos he's fucked,

32:07.759 --> 32:10.461
Marty's ill, Nathan's with the girls,

32:10.528 --> 32:14.399
Aaron's not speaking to the girls.
This is gonna be fucking wicked.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.868
Hopefully tonight
will be more chilled.

32:16.934 --> 32:19.837
If it's just me you and the girls,
what could fucking...

32:19.904 --> 32:23.207
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?

32:24.609 --> 32:27.679
I'll answer that question
in five hours time.

32:27.745 --> 32:30.014
Me and Marnie have argued
for two nights,

32:30.081 --> 32:32.784
but I don't want to fight any more.
Let hope tonight

32:32.850 --> 32:35.720
she apologises and hopefully
we can have a good night.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.223
Scotty's not coming out, dunno where
Marty is, think he's in bed.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.958
So... shall we do it?

32:41.025 --> 32:43.861
I was hoping
something might happen with Marty,

32:43.928 --> 32:46.664
but he's staying in.
What a sickener.

32:48.733 --> 32:52.003
Tonight is our last night, I just
hope me and Aaron can make up.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.639
I don't want any kick-offs.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.942
Tonight, I wanna go out with a bang.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.178
When I dance, I look fucking sexy.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.647
I've never felt so low
than what I feel now.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.818
The way I'm feeling,
I don't see us ever coming back.

33:06.884 --> 33:09.187
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:11.956 --> 33:12.156
.

33:14.692 --> 33:14.892
.

33:14.959 --> 33:18.262
'Very bad language and sexual scenes
continue in this part,

33:18.329 --> 33:22.800
there are also scenes of aggressive
behaviour, consider yourself warned.'

33:26.371 --> 33:28.606
We get to the club
and it's fucking wicked.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.308
Tonight is gonna be mint.

33:30.375 --> 33:34.145
The place is absolutely bouncing
and everyone's buzzing.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.754
Let's get fucking mortal.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.693
We're all getting along,
we're all dancing, all drunk.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.027
I've got a good feeling.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.333
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm gutted Marty's not here.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.568
I like him
and I wanna spend time with him.

33:57.635 --> 34:00.905
But I'm having a wicked night
and I feel like I'm back to myself.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.013
Everyone takes the piss
out of my dancing,

34:09.080 --> 34:13.184
but I know they're jealous.
When I dance, I look fucking sexy.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.956
Howay, Chantelle. Let's have
a lap dancing competition.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.659
I know you're a pro,
but I'm still the best dancer.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.762
One, two, three!

34:26.931 --> 34:29.333
Chloe's challenged us
to a competition,

34:29.400 --> 34:32.335
but to be honest,
it's not much of a competition.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.206
I love you Chloe,
but don't give up the day job.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.011
I mean, I'm no expert on lap dances,

34:40.077 --> 34:44.081
but Chloe wouldn't be getting 20 quid
off me for this. It's fucking shit.

34:46.350 --> 34:50.987
Chloe's dancing is
an embarrassment to the human race

35:00.331 --> 35:02.967
I need to teach
this bitch some moves.

35:07.238 --> 35:11.909
Nathan, you can't even walk, let
alone dance. You fucking charva.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.716
Well, that was an epic fail.
I'm just gonna stick to drinking.

35:20.585 --> 35:24.922
I can see Marnie is still bothered
that her and Aaron aren't talking.

35:24.989 --> 35:27.992
But I think Aaron will man up
tonight and speak to her.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.869
Chloe can see I'm stressed

35:37.935 --> 35:40.705
and she's literally got
the mentality of a goldfish.

35:40.771 --> 35:43.774
So, if she can see,
everyone else must be noticing, too.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.020
Come on, Aaron, I'm right here.
Come and speak to us.

35:56.087 --> 35:59.223
We're better than this,
I don't want to argue any more.

36:03.094 --> 36:06.597
It's our last night in Magaluf
and I wanna go out with a bang.

36:10.134 --> 36:15.039
Fuck me. Whoo! This drink is lethal.

36:26.083 --> 36:29.954
Fucking hell, man. What are you
trying to do? Blow my head off?

36:41.465 --> 36:44.769
I can see that Aaron's a bit lost,
it seems the Marnie situation

36:44.835 --> 36:49.373
is getting to him a lot more
than he's making out.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.376
Nights out used to be about
me and Marnie having a laugh.

36:52.443 --> 36:56.314
I hate the way missing her makes us
feel. I hope she says sorry soon.

37:14.665 --> 37:18.002
I can't believe Marnie and Aaron
haven't talked to each other.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.770
It's totally ridiculous.

37:19.837 --> 37:23.674
If they don't talk to each other,
how are they meant to sort it out?

37:51.002 --> 37:54.605
Talking to Nathan
and he says that he misses us,

37:54.672 --> 37:57.074
which is nice to hear.
He is a good lad.

38:02.079 --> 38:05.249
Marnie still hasn't told him
that she's bisexual.

38:05.316 --> 38:08.719
It's not a big deal, but it's a
massive secret in a relationship.

38:25.903 --> 38:29.173
Nathan's pulled me over to tell us
that Marnie's bisexual,

38:29.240 --> 38:31.709
which is fine,
but she's my girlfriend,

38:31.776 --> 38:34.111
so why the fuck am I
the last person to know?

38:41.886 --> 38:44.488
What annoys me is that Marnie
keeps kissing Chloe

38:44.555 --> 38:47.091
thinking it's all right.
It's fucking not.

38:50.561 --> 38:53.097
I can't believe this.
I can't think straight.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.665
I'm so fucking annoyed.

38:57.802 --> 39:01.605
What the fuck have I just done?

39:05.276 --> 39:07.712
I look over and Aaron
has ran out of the club.

39:19.490 --> 39:23.694
Gary's got something to tell Marnie,
he looks worried. What's going on?

39:30.601 --> 39:34.705
Nathan knows above anyone
that this news should come from me.

39:34.772 --> 39:36.440
I can't believe he told Aaron.

39:40.811 --> 39:44.081
I've spent the whole night
waiting for Aaron to speak to us,

39:44.148 --> 39:47.017
to find out that he's left
the club without telling us.

39:47.084 --> 39:49.720
I am fuming. I can't be here now.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.931
I thought this was gonna be
a drama-free night,

40:00.998 --> 40:03.834
but it seems as though
that's not the case any more.

40:15.913 --> 40:19.083
Ever since I walked in the house,
me and Marnie have kissed,

40:19.150 --> 40:22.653
there's nothing wrong with it.
Aaron needs to grow the fuck up.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.599
Everyone's used to us kissing.
No-one bats and eyelid.

40:35.666 --> 40:37.535
We do it regular, it's like a hobby.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.373
Why do things always get so messy?

40:42.439 --> 40:46.243
It's time to get out of here
before it gets worse.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.948
I've never felt so low
than what I feel now.

40:51.015 --> 40:54.418
Aaron has made this situation
ten times worse.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.288
I thought I could rely on him to be
there for us

40:57.354 --> 41:00.558
and he's completely walked out
on us. I can't believe it.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.837
I get back to the villa and I just
wanna pack my bags and be gone.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.942
I haven't got a problem
with Marnie's sexuality.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.845
I just wish she'd told us about it.
I'm fucked off

41:20.911 --> 41:24.415
that she was kissing Chloe,
cos that is basically cheating.

41:24.481 --> 41:27.318
And she couldn't apologise
when she swilled us.

41:27.384 --> 41:30.955
My head is all over the place.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.633
We're back at the villa and I'm
going up to see if Aaron's there.

41:46.871 --> 41:47.972
Everything's gone.

41:49.106 --> 41:50.407
Everything.

41:50.474 --> 41:53.544
Aaron's fucked off
and Marnie's fuming.

41:53.611 --> 41:55.212
This isn't a relationship.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.316
Tonight has been a disaster.

41:59.383 --> 42:02.820
If Marnie had just spoken to Aaron,
this could have been avoided.

42:02.887 --> 42:06.624
Now I've lost Aaron.
This night couldn't get any worse.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.095
I honestly thought
it was gonna be a good night.

42:11.161 --> 42:15.599
I was having the best time,
but that was me being a mug.

42:15.666 --> 42:19.003
Once again, me and Aaron
are in the same position.

42:19.069 --> 42:22.940
He's got an issue and instead of
sorting it, he's run away from it.

42:23.007 --> 42:26.677
I'm always a fucking mug to Aaron.
Always, man.

42:29.246 --> 42:32.616
Aaron leaving proves that
he's got no respect for me

42:32.683 --> 42:35.386
and no respect for the relationship.
I am fuming.

42:40.491 --> 42:43.494
I've been waiting so long for us
to make a go of things,

42:43.560 --> 42:45.729
but since day one, it's been a mess.

42:45.796 --> 42:48.265
There's no way I can live
in a house with Marnie.

42:48.332 --> 42:51.669
And the way I'm feeling,
I don't see us ever coming back.

42:56.607 --> 42:59.009
I never thought Aaron
would leave and give up.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.377
I hate him so much.

43:00.444 --> 43:03.614
Hopefully, Kavos can bring us
all back together.

43:04.815 --> 43:06.884
Gary, what the fuck are you doing?

43:06.951 --> 43:09.987
Who's your fucking baby?!
(screaming)

43:10.054 --> 43:12.323
It's Sophie!
Gary and Chantelle kissed.

43:12.389 --> 43:15.693
This boy is a heartless bastard.

43:17.394 --> 43:18.729
I'm fucking fuming.

43:18.796 --> 43:21.098
You are mugging me off.

43:21.165 --> 43:23.133
What the fuck is wrong with her?

43:23.200 --> 43:25.302
It's a good time to be alive.

43:25.369 --> 43:26.603
Goodnight.

43:51.428 --> 43:51.628
.
