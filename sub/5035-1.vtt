01:38.731 --> 01:41.199
Emily?

01:41.301 --> 01:42.131
Emily!

01:42.235 --> 01:45.432
Come, little children

01:45.572 --> 01:49.702
I'll take thee away

01:49.809 --> 01:52.835
- Into a land
- Emily!

01:52.946 --> 01:57.576
Of enchantment

01:57.717 --> 02:00.948
Come, little children

02:01.087 --> 02:05.217
- The time's come to say
- Elijah! Elijah!

02:05.325 --> 02:08.259
- Hast thou seen my sister Emily?
- Nay.

02:08.394 --> 02:11.192
But look. They conjure.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.231
Oh, God. The woods!

02:22.308 --> 02:23.935
Emily!

02:25.712 --> 02:27.771
- She's done for.
- Not yet!

02:27.881 --> 02:31.112
You wake my father.
Summon the elders. Go!

02:36.289 --> 02:38.519
Emily!

03:13.993 --> 03:15.483
Come, child.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.785
- Ahh.
- Oh, yes.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.324
- Emily.
- Huh?

04:00.673 --> 04:05.372
Oh, look.
Another glorious morning.

04:05.511 --> 04:09.174
It makes me sick!

04:09.282 --> 04:11.648
- Sisters!
- Yes, Winnie.
- We're coming, Winnie.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.049
Right away. Sorry.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.485
Must've been an imp.

04:16.589 --> 04:21.185
My darling.
My little book.

04:21.293 --> 04:25.196
We must continue with our spell now that
our little guest of honor has arrived.

04:25.298 --> 04:28.699
Wake up. Wake up, darling.

04:28.801 --> 04:34.171
Yes. Oh, come along, darling.
There you are.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.742
- Mary!
- Right here, Winnie, right here.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.538
- Sorry.
- Hello. Hello.

04:39.646 --> 04:43.742
- I've noticed sister Sarah isn't helping.
- I lured the child here.

04:43.883 --> 04:47.284
Leave her be.
She hath done her chore.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.217
- You're right, I'm wrong.
- Mmm.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.790
All right.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.721
'Tis time!

04:55.995 --> 05:01.297
There it is: '' Bring to a full rolling
bubble. Add two drops oil of boil.''

05:01.434 --> 05:03.800
Ah-ah-ah. I got it. It's heavy.
You do that, I'll do this.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.938
'' Mix blood of owl
with the herb that's red.

05:15.081 --> 05:18.244
Turn three times,
pluck a hair from my head.

05:18.351 --> 05:21.912
Add a dash of pox
and a dead man's toe.''

05:22.021 --> 05:26.082
- Dead man's toe, and make it a fleshy one.
- Dead man's toe!

05:26.192 --> 05:29.093
Deadman's toe
Add a deadman's toe

05:29.195 --> 05:31.595
Deadman's toe
Deadman's t--

05:31.698 --> 05:34.098
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead

05:34.200 --> 05:35.599
D-- Ooh!

05:37.003 --> 05:40.598
- Uh-oh. Deadman's toe
- Fresh one.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.501
- Deadman, deadman
- Deadman's toe, add a--

05:47.480 --> 05:52.008
Will you two stop that!
I need to concentrate!

05:52.151 --> 05:54.346
Sorry, uh--

05:54.487 --> 05:56.955
She needs to concentrate.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.796
''Green newt saliva.''

06:08.901 --> 06:13.463
- I-I smell a child.
- Ehh, what dost thou call that?

06:13.573 --> 06:15.632
- A child.
- Hmph!

06:15.742 --> 06:18.836
Sisters, gather 'round.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.811
- One thing more, and all is done.
- Yes?

06:21.914 --> 06:24.883
Add a bit of thine own tongue.

06:27.587 --> 06:31.853
Oh, Winnie, thou art divine.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.721
'Tis ready for tasting.

06:34.861 --> 06:39.525
One drop of this
and her life will be mine.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.065
- I mean, ours.
- Yeah.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.400
All right, girl.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.907
Open up your mouth.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.171
- No!
- A boy!

06:54.280 --> 06:58.080
- Get him, you fools!
- I got him. I knew I smelled a boy!

06:58.217 --> 07:00.685
I got him. Come on. Come on.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.186
- Get away!
- Here you go.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.188
- Get away from my potion!
- Ohh!

07:08.561 --> 07:09.926
Ohh!

07:11.397 --> 07:13.865
- Winnie!
- My potion!

07:14.534 --> 07:15.899
Emily!

07:20.473 --> 07:22.373
Hmm. Hmm.

07:30.817 --> 07:34.412
Winnie. Winnie.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.546
- Look.
- Ahh!

07:37.657 --> 07:40.421
Sisters, prepare thyselves.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.961
'Tis her life force.
The potion works!

07:44.096 --> 07:47.759
Take my hands.
We will share her.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.562
Oh, Winnie,
how generous of thee.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.649
Sisters, behold!

08:12.792 --> 08:18.162
I am beautiful!
Boys will love me!

08:19.665 --> 08:21.656
Weâ€™re young!

08:23.102 --> 08:25.662
Well, younger.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.670
But it's a start!

08:29.108 --> 08:30.973
Sisters!

08:32.477 --> 08:34.809
Winifred, thou art
a mere sprig of a girl.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.414
Liar! But I shall be
a sprig forever,

08:37.517 --> 08:42.010
once I suck the life out of
all the children in Salem!

08:42.154 --> 08:44.782
Let's brew another batch!

08:44.891 --> 08:49.021
You hag! There are not enough
children in the world to make
thee young and beautiful!

08:49.161 --> 08:51.959
- Hag.
- Uh-oh.

08:52.064 --> 08:56.160
Sisters, did you hear
what he called you?

08:56.302 --> 08:58.133
Whatever shall we do with him?

08:58.237 --> 09:01.001
Let's barbecue and fillet him.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.940
- Hang him on a hook
and let me play with him?
- No!

09:05.044 --> 09:08.844
Book, darling, come to Mommy.

09:08.981 --> 09:12.712
Yes. His punishment
must be more fulsome,

09:12.852 --> 09:14.877
more lingering.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.548
Dazzle me, my darling.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.660
Let's see: amnesia, bunions,
chilblains, cholera.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.389
- We can do better than that, I think.
- Yes.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.464
Let's see what we have. Oh!

09:26.566 --> 09:30.127
Ahh. Perfect.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.670
As usual.

09:32.772 --> 09:37.038
- His punishment shall not be to die,
- No?

09:37.176 --> 09:41.135
but to live forever
with his guilt.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.978
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- Jump back!

09:45.084 --> 09:47.518
Twist the bones
and bend the back.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.679
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.916
Trim him of his baby fat.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.185
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.523
Give him fur,
black as black.

09:56.629 --> 09:59.097
- Just...
- Like...
- This.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.512
- Open!
- Witches!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.610
Daughters of darkness!
Open this door!

10:21.754 --> 10:24.245
- Hide the child!
- The child!
- Come on!

10:24.390 --> 10:28.417
Witches? Uh, there be
no witches here, sir!

10:28.561 --> 10:31.428
Don't get your knickers
in a twist!

10:31.564 --> 10:34.556
We are just three kindly
old spinster ladies!

10:34.667 --> 10:37.568
Uh, spending a quiet
evening at home!

10:37.670 --> 10:40.070
Sucking the lives
out of little children!

10:41.340 --> 10:43.900
- Winifred Sanderson?
- Yes?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.410
I will ask thee one final time.

10:46.512 --> 10:49.413
- Yes?
- What hast thou done
with my son Thackery?

10:49.515 --> 10:51.745
- Thackery. Mmm.
- Answer me!

10:51.851 --> 10:54.547
- Well, I don't know.
- Speak!

10:54.654 --> 10:56.622
Cat's got my tongue.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.495
This is-- This is
terribly uncomfortable.

11:06.632 --> 11:08.657
Sisters, sing.

11:12.471 --> 11:15.804
Thrice I with mercury purify
and spit upon the 12 tables

11:15.941 --> 11:19.274
- Don't listen! Cover your ears!
- Listen to them not!

11:23.049 --> 11:26.280
Ah! Fools! All of you!

11:26.385 --> 11:28.478
My ungodly book speaks to you.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.953
On All Hallows Eve
when the moon is round,

11:31.057 --> 11:35.016
a virgin will summon us
from under the ground.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.959
Ohh! Ohhh! We shall be back!

11:38.064 --> 11:41.363
And the lives of all
the children shall be mine!

12:04.256 --> 12:06.224
Away!

12:06.358 --> 12:08.485
Away, beast!

12:12.098 --> 12:13.963
Poor Thackery Binx.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.695
Neither his father, his mother,
nor anyone else...

12:17.837 --> 12:20.169
ever knew what became of him...

12:20.272 --> 12:23.730
those 3OO years ago.

12:23.876 --> 12:27.972
And so the Sanderson Sisters...

12:28.080 --> 12:32.039
were hanged
by the Salem town folk.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.676
Now, there are those who say
that on Halloween night...

12:35.788 --> 12:41.385
a black cat still guards
the old Sanderson house,

12:41.527 --> 12:45.861
warning off any who
might make the witches...

12:45.965 --> 12:48.525
come back to life!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.899
Gimme a break.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.840
Aha. We seem to have
a sceptic in our midst.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.037
Mr. Dennison,
would you care to share...

13:01.147 --> 13:04.583
your California, laid-back,
tie-dyed point of view?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.113
Okay.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.245
Granted that, uh,
you guys here in Salem...

13:10.389 --> 13:13.449
are all into these, uh, black
cats and witches and stuff.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.890
- Stuff?
- Fine.

13:15.995 --> 13:19.556
But everyone here knows that Halloween
was invented by the candy companies.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.190
- Ohh!
- It's a conspiracy.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.861
It just so happens that
Halloween is based...

13:24.970 --> 13:27.871
on the ancient feast
called All Hallows Eve.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.602
It's the one night of they ear
where the spirits of the dead
can return to Earth.

13:34.847 --> 13:37.407
Well said, Allison.

13:40.786 --> 13:45.450
Well, in case Jimi Hendrix shows
up tonight, here's my number.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.331
Come on, let's go.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.762
- Hey, wait up.
- Did he call you?

13:54.867 --> 13:56.767
- Yeah.
- Well, what did he say?

13:56.869 --> 13:59.429
Max. Fat chance.

14:22.895 --> 14:24.692
- Allison.
- Hi.

14:24.830 --> 14:29.494
Hi. Look, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you in class.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.830
You didn't.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.838
- My name is Max Dennison.
- Yeah, I know.
You just moved here, huh?

14:34.974 --> 14:37.966
- Yeah, last week.
- Must be a big change for you.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.136
Yeah, that's for sure.

14:40.246 --> 14:44.649
- You don't like it here?
- Oh, the leaves are great, but--

14:44.750 --> 14:48.481
- I-I don't know.
just all this Halloween stuff.
- You don't believe in it?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.988
What, do you mean, like,
the Sanderson Sisters? No way.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.219
- Not even on Halloween?
- Especially not on Halloween.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.659
Trick or treat.

15:10.376 --> 15:13.174
- Hey, Christie, wait for me.
- No, I don't think so.
- I'm coming!

15:47.379 --> 15:50.507
Halt! Who are you?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.880
Max. I just moved here.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.920
- From where?
- Los Angeles.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.388
- L.A.?
- Ohh!

16:01.493 --> 16:04.951
- Dude!
- Tubular.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.292
I'm Jay. This is Ernie.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.203
How many times I gotta tell you,
my name ain't Ernie no more.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.068
- It's Ice.
- Oh.
- Ice.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.276
This is Ice.

16:24.616 --> 16:28.074
So, let's have a butt.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.984
Ah, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.488
They're very health conscious
in Los Angeles.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.595
You got any cash...

16:40.032 --> 16:42.125
Hollywood?

16:42.267 --> 16:44.929
- No.
- Gee.

16:45.037 --> 16:49.838
We don't get any smokes from
you, we don't get any cash.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.910
What am I supposed to do
with my afternoon?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.810
Maybe you could learn to
breathe through your nose.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.285
Whoa!

17:01.387 --> 17:03.981
Check out
the new cross-trainers.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.819
Cool. Let me try 'em on.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.160
Ah-ah.

17:12.897 --> 17:16.128
- Later, dude!
- See ya, Hollywood!

17:33.052 --> 17:35.953
- Hey, Max! Hey, how was school?
- It sucked!

17:36.055 --> 17:37.818
Hey, hey, hey,
watch your language.

17:40.926 --> 17:43.827
I can't believe
you made me move here!

17:49.935 --> 17:52.335
Huh. He wasn't wearing
any shoes.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.573
Well, must be
some form of protest.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.587
Hey, guys.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.534
Oh, Allison.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.373
You're so soft.
I just wanna--

18:35.481 --> 18:37.381
- Boo!
- Dani!

18:41.153 --> 18:44.281
I scared you, I scared you!
Ha ha ha-ha ha!

18:44.423 --> 18:48.553
I'm Allison. Allison.
Kiss me. I'm Allison!

18:48.660 --> 18:50.924
Mom and Dad told you
to stay out of my room!

18:51.063 --> 18:53.224
Don't be such a crab!

18:53.332 --> 18:56.893
Guess what. You're gonna
take me trick-or-treating.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.971
- Not this year, Dani.
- Mom said you have to.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.404
- Well, she can take you.
- She and Dad are going to
a party at Town Hall.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.477
Well, you're eight!
Go by yourself.

19:12.184 --> 19:15.915
No way! This is my first time!
I'll get lost!

19:16.021 --> 19:19.582
Besides, it's a full moon
outside! The weirdos are out!

19:23.595 --> 19:28.760
Come on, Max. Couldn't you
forget about being a cool
teenager just for one night?

19:28.867 --> 19:31.062
Please? Come on.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.436
We used to have so much fun together
trick-or-treating. Remember?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.839
It'll be like old times.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.774
No. The old days are dead.

19:40.879 --> 19:44.440
It doesn't matter what you say.
You're taking me!

19:44.550 --> 19:46.450
Wanna bet?

19:55.227 --> 19:57.923
Mom!

20:00.399 --> 20:04.130
Let's go. Hurry up!
The bewitching hour is about to begin!

20:04.236 --> 20:06.136
Wow-- Aah! Please help me!
Aah!

20:06.238 --> 20:09.469
-Isn't that a scary witch?
-Stop! You look very scary. Wow!

20:12.144 --> 20:14.840
What about you, Max?
What are you supposed to be?

20:14.980 --> 20:17.107
- A rap singer.
- Oh.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.116
Well, your hat should be
on sideways, shouldn't it?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.152
- Say '' Halloween''!
- Halloween!
- Halloween!

20:25.357 --> 20:27.723
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

20:35.033 --> 20:37.399
- Lighten up, Max.
- Can we go home now?

20:37.536 --> 20:39.401
No.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.573
Letâ€™s just go this way.

20:50.716 --> 20:51.683
Dani.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.553
Ding-ding. Ding-ding.

20:55.687 --> 20:58.918
- Stop and pay the toll, kid.
- Ten chocolate bars. No licor ice.

20:59.057 --> 21:03.357
- Dump out your sack.
- Drop dead. Moron.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.692
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

21:05.797 --> 21:08.027
Yo, twerp.

21:08.133 --> 21:11.034
- How'd you like to be hung
off that telephone pole?
- Yeah!

21:11.136 --> 21:16.199
Iâ€™d just like to see you try,
because it just so happens
I've got my big brother with me.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.037
- Oooh!
- Max!

21:21.280 --> 21:24.374
- Hollywood!
- Oh, no!

21:30.055 --> 21:33.957
So, you're doing
a little trick-or-treating.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.957
- Ding-dong.
- Whoo!

21:38.230 --> 21:40.790
- I'm just taking
my little sister around.
- Mmm.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.797
That's nice.

21:42.934 --> 21:46.426
- Whoa! I love the costume!
- Yeah!

21:46.571 --> 21:50.063
But what are you supposed to be?
A New Kid On The Block?

21:51.610 --> 21:54.602
For your information,
he's a Little Leaguer.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.907
- Whoa!
- Ooh, tough guy!
- I'm a Little Leaguer!

21:57.015 --> 21:58.414
Whoa!

21:59.785 --> 22:02.219
Yeah!

22:02.321 --> 22:06.257
- Wait a minute.
Everybody pays the toll.
- Stuff it, zitface.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.087
- Why, you little--
- Hey!

22:08.193 --> 22:11.424
Ice, here. Pig out.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.589
Come on, Dani, let's go.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.257
jerk.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.961
And Hollywood,
the shoes fit great!

22:20.539 --> 22:21.836
Yeah!

22:21.973 --> 22:23.964
- Trick or treat!
- You should've punched him.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.475
He would've killed me.

22:26.611 --> 22:29.637
- At least you would've died like a man.
- Hey!

22:32.517 --> 22:36.248
You just humiliated me in front
of half the guys at school!

22:36.355 --> 22:39.324
So collect your candy
and get out of my life!

22:39.458 --> 22:41.653
I wanna go home now!

22:43.795 --> 22:47.322
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!
- Hi. Hi. Ooh, there's plenty--

22:58.377 --> 23:00.709
Dani, I'm sorry.

23:00.846 --> 23:03.371
Trick or treat!

23:03.515 --> 23:06.313
It's just that
I hate this place.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.613
I miss all my friends.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.688
I wanna go home!

23:10.822 --> 23:14.223
Well, this is your home now,
so get used to it.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.985
Yeah.

23:18.096 --> 23:21.623
Trick or treat!

23:21.733 --> 23:24.634
- Give me one more chance?
- Why should I?

23:26.738 --> 23:28.638
Because I'm your brother.

23:36.114 --> 23:39.015
Whoa. Check that out.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.018
What?

23:42.120 --> 23:44.350
Something just few
across the moon.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.864
- Fooled ya.
- Let's go,jerkface.

23:53.965 --> 23:55.523
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

23:55.634 --> 23:57.534
- Wow!
- Wow!

23:57.636 --> 23:59.604
Check out this house!

23:59.738 --> 24:02.172
Ehh. Rich people.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.107
They'd probably make us
drink cider and bob for apples.

24:05.243 --> 24:08.041
- My accountant suggested penny stocks.
- Yeah.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.951
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

24:16.455 --> 24:19.117
-Jackpot!
- Ahh.

24:19.257 --> 24:20.724
Whoa!

24:22.427 --> 24:25.055
Max Dennison.

24:25.163 --> 24:26.391
Allison!

24:26.498 --> 24:29.956
Ohh. Allison, hmm?

24:30.101 --> 24:32.797
I thought you weren't
into Halloween.

24:32.938 --> 24:36.237
I'm not. I'm, I'm just taking
my little sister Dani around.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.104
That's nice.

24:38.243 --> 24:41.576
- I always do it.
- My parents made him.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.910
Do you guys want some cider?

24:44.015 --> 24:45.744
- No.
- Sure.

24:50.188 --> 24:52.748
- Ah, yes.
- Oh, I had my eye on that.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.126
Thanks.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.566
So, um, how's the party?

25:04.669 --> 25:07.797
Boring. It'sjust a bunch of my parents'
friends. They do this every year.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.439
I've got candy duty.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.844
- By the way, Dani, I love your costume.
- Thank you.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.813
I really like yours too.

25:18.950 --> 25:22.613
Of course, I couldn't wear anything
like that because I don't have any--

25:22.721 --> 25:25.281
What do you call 'em, Max?
Yabos?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.619
Max likes your yabos.

25:29.728 --> 25:32.288
In fact, he loves 'em.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.598
- I'm really into witches.
- Really? Me too.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.001
We just learned about
those sisters in school.

25:41.139 --> 25:43.130
Oh, you mean
the Sanderson Sisters?

25:43.241 --> 25:45.607
I know all about them.
My mom used to run the museum.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.769
There's a museum about 'em?

25:47.879 --> 25:52.782
Yeah, but they shut it down because, um,
a lot of spooky things happened there.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.819
Well, wh-why don't we go to
this old Sanderson house?

25:58.423 --> 26:00.823
Well, come on,
make a believer out of me.

26:02.427 --> 26:05.328
Okay, let me get changed.
They'll never miss me.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.237
Max, I'm not going up there.

26:13.371 --> 26:17.171
My friends at school told me all
about that place. It's weird!

26:17.275 --> 26:19.675
Dani, this is the girl
of my dreams.

26:19.778 --> 26:23.179
- So? Take her to the movies
like a normal person.
- Dani!

26:25.383 --> 26:28.011
Look,just--just do
this one thing for me,

26:28.119 --> 26:30.019
and I'll do anything you say.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.214
Please?

26:32.357 --> 26:35.019
- Please? Please?
- Oh-- Okay. Okay.

26:35.126 --> 26:38.926
Next year we go trick-or-treating
as Wendy and Peter Pan.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.929
With tights, or it's no deal.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.903
Okay, okay. Deal. Deal. Fine.

26:49.541 --> 26:53.773
Legend has it that the bones
of a hundred children were
buried within these walls.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.777
Oh, great.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.223
Ecch.

27:23.675 --> 27:27.076
- I can't see a thing.
- Ooh.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.648
Well, there's a light switch
around here somewhere.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.431
Found a lighter.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.575
Whoa!

28:04.549 --> 28:06.847
Here's the original cauldron.

28:06.985 --> 28:09.453
And upstairs
is where they slept.

28:14.726 --> 28:18.287
Oh, and be careful where you
step. The foors are old.

28:21.966 --> 28:25.299
''This is the spell book
of Winifred Sanderson.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.702
It was given to her
by the devil himself.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.705
The book is bound
in human skin...

28:30.842 --> 28:35.279
and contains the recipes for her
most powerful and evil spells.''

28:35.380 --> 28:37.280
I get the picture.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.377
What's that?

28:41.519 --> 28:44.386
Oh. It's the black fame candle.

28:53.064 --> 28:56.795
Hmm. Black fame candle.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.369
'' Made from the fat of a hangman.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.667
Legend says that on a full moon it
will raise the spirits of the dead...

29:02.774 --> 29:05.174
when lit by a virgin
on Halloween night.''

29:08.279 --> 29:10.747
Hmm.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.511
So let's light the sucker
and meet the old broads.

29:14.619 --> 29:17.520
- Will you do the honors?
- No, thanks.

29:17.622 --> 29:18.520
Well--

29:24.596 --> 29:27.861
- Stupid cat!
- Okay, Max, you've had your fun.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.696
It's time to go.
Come on, Allison.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.362
Max, she's right. Let's go.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.702
Oh, come on. It's just
a bunch of hocus pocus.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.767
Max, I'm not kidding this time.
It's time to go!

29:40.912 --> 29:42.777
Max, no!

29:45.650 --> 29:48.118
Uh-oh.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.487
What happened?

30:29.627 --> 30:32.425
A virgin... lit the candle.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.781
We are home!

30:55.887 --> 30:57.946
Oh, sweet revenge!

30:58.056 --> 31:01.492
Do you see, sisters?
My curse worked perfectly!

31:01.626 --> 31:03.321
That's because thou art perfect.

31:10.168 --> 31:13.467
I knew I left this cauldron on.
Didn't I tell you? Oh, I knew it.

31:13.571 --> 31:17.974
My lucky rat tail!
just where I left it!

31:20.311 --> 31:25.112
But who lit
the black fame candle? Hmm.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.319
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyhead.

31:33.424 --> 31:36.882
Oh, I've missed you.
Did you miss me too?

31:38.763 --> 31:40.355
Come on, now,
we've got work to do.

31:40.498 --> 31:41.965
- Winnie.
- Yes?

31:42.066 --> 31:44.660
I smell children.

31:46.671 --> 31:48.002
Sic 'em!

31:49.774 --> 31:52.504
- It's a little girl.
- Mmm!

31:52.610 --> 31:55.408
Seven. Maybe eight.
And a half.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.810
Ooh, let us play with her!

31:57.916 --> 32:01.147
Come, little children

32:01.252 --> 32:04.881
I'll take thee away

32:05.023 --> 32:10.325
- In--
- Come out, my dear.
We will not harm thee.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.692
We love children!

32:14.132 --> 32:16.862
I thought thou would
never come, sisters.

32:16.968 --> 32:18.936
Greetings, little one.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.937
- 'Twas I who brought you back.
- Imagine.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.934
Such a pretty little...

32:27.078 --> 32:28.739
child.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.247
Look at her. And she's
so well fed, isn't she?

32:32.383 --> 32:35.113
Plump. Plump!

32:35.253 --> 32:36.584
Shis-ka-baby.

32:37.956 --> 32:42.256
Tell me, dumpling,
what is the year?

32:42.393 --> 32:44.588
1 993.

32:44.729 --> 32:49.428
Sisters, we have been gone
3OO years.

32:49.567 --> 32:52.058
Well, Winnie,
how time fies, huh?

32:52.270 --> 32:54.067
When you're dead!

33:03.915 --> 33:07.442
It's been great fun, but I--
I guess I'd better be going.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.450
Oh, stay for supper.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.548
I'm-- I'm-- I'm not hungry.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.922
Oh, but we are.

33:18.429 --> 33:21.262
- Soup!
- Hey!

33:21.366 --> 33:23.926
- Let go of my little sister.
- Roast him, Winnie.

33:24.035 --> 33:26.765
No, let me.
Let me play with him.

33:38.883 --> 33:40.851
You. There.

33:42.987 --> 33:45.353
I haven't lost my touch,
sisters. See?

33:45.490 --> 33:47.185
- Winnie, Winnie--
- Max!

33:48.559 --> 33:51.790
- Hello. Good-bye.
- Hello, hello.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.198
Max!

33:59.070 --> 34:01.038
- Mary!
- Well, hello--

34:03.574 --> 34:05.508
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my.
- Don't!

34:07.645 --> 34:09.340
Okay!

34:09.480 --> 34:12.710
- You leave my brother alone!
- Ohh!

34:14.217 --> 34:15.879
- Max!
- I'll get you!

34:18.156 --> 34:22.149
- Get him! Get this ani--
Get this beast off me!
- Max, come on. Let's go!

34:25.096 --> 34:26.563
Get out! Go, go, go!

34:28.032 --> 34:30.364
Get it off. Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha!

34:35.172 --> 34:36.639
- Hey!
- Hmm?

34:38.275 --> 34:40.676
You've messed with the
great and powerful Max...

34:40.777 --> 34:43.007
and now must suffer
the consequences.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.514
I summon the burning rain
of death.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.210
- Burning what?
- Burning rain of death.
- Burning rain of death.

34:49.954 --> 34:52.013
He makes fire in his hand.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.220
Ohh! Ohh! The burning
rain of death! Ohh! Ohh!

34:58.362 --> 35:00.694
Come on, you idiots!
Get under shelter!

35:00.798 --> 35:03.198
Come on, you fools!

35:08.306 --> 35:10.365
Nice going, Max!

35:10.475 --> 35:12.705
- It's all your fault!
- You can talk.

35:12.810 --> 35:17.076
- Yeah, no kidding.
Now, get the spell book.
- You idiots!

35:17.215 --> 35:20.048
Come on, move it!

35:20.151 --> 35:22.881
N-N-No, it's not!
It's the burning rain of death!

35:26.491 --> 35:29.255
Sic 'em! Aah! My book!

35:32.330 --> 35:35.925
Don't! He's going for my book!
Ohhh!

35:36.067 --> 35:38.058
- My book!
- He's got the book!
- The book!

35:39.403 --> 35:41.064
Max! Max, over here!

35:41.172 --> 35:43.140
- Come on! Come on!
- This way!

35:45.843 --> 35:47.936
Ohh! Confound it!

35:49.313 --> 35:52.578
- Winnie!
- We are dead!
- Shut up!

35:52.683 --> 35:55.481
- It is but water!
- Huh?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.315
- Most refreshing.
- Ahh. It is.

35:57.455 --> 36:00.049
- You idiot!
- Ahhh!
- The boy has tricked us!

36:00.158 --> 36:02.626
- And he's stolen the book!
- Ahhh!
- After him!
- Ohh!

36:11.969 --> 36:16.133
- 'Tis a b-black river.
- Perhaps it is not too deep.

36:22.146 --> 36:24.842
- 'Tis firm!
- Careful, Winnie.
- Hmm. Mmm.

36:24.982 --> 36:27.610
- 'Tis firm as stone.
- Why-- Why, it's a road!

36:27.718 --> 36:29.310
- Firm asstone
- Sisters!
- Firm asstone

36:29.453 --> 36:31.318
My book!

36:47.972 --> 36:51.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on! This is a graveyard!

36:51.676 --> 36:55.840
It's hallowed ground.
Witches can't set foot here.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.811
- He talks.
- Oh.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.484
Follow me!

37:08.859 --> 37:11.885
Over here.
I want to show you something.

37:12.029 --> 37:14.896
Give you an idea of exactly
what we're dealing with.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.841
''William Butcherson,
lost soul''?

37:24.942 --> 37:27.172
Billy Butcherson
was Winifred's lover,

37:27.278 --> 37:29.712
but she found him sporting
with her sister Sarah,

37:29.847 --> 37:33.339
so she poisoned him and sewed
his mouth shut with a dull needle...

37:33.451 --> 37:36.249
so he couldn't tell her
secrets even in death.

37:36.387 --> 37:39.151
- Winifred always was the jealous type.
- You're Thackery Binx.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.885
- Yes.
- Huh. So the legends are true.

37:42.026 --> 37:44.995
Well, come along. I want
to show you something else.

37:49.734 --> 37:52.828
Teenagers again.
I hate Halloween.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.269
Man, this is the worst night of
the year. You wanna give me a hand?

37:55.406 --> 37:57.874
- Who-- Who-- Who-- Who are they?
- Boys?

37:57.975 --> 37:59.704
Witch hunters. Observe.

37:59.810 --> 38:04.372
They wear black robes and carry
axes to chop the wood to burn us.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.541
- Hold me.
- What a pretty spider.

38:08.252 --> 38:12.086
Sisters! Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.249
The magic
that brought us back...

38:15.393 --> 38:18.226
only works tonight,
on All Hallows Eve.

38:18.329 --> 38:21.594
When the sun comes up,
we are dust.

38:21.732 --> 38:22.960
- Dust?
- Toast!

38:23.100 --> 38:24.863
Toast?

38:24.969 --> 38:27.233
- Pudding!
- Aaah!

38:27.338 --> 38:30.739
Fortunately the potion I brewed
the night we were hanged...

38:30.841 --> 38:33.571
will keep us alive
and young forever.

38:33.678 --> 38:37.444
Unfortunately the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

38:37.581 --> 38:39.105
and the little wretches
have stolen it!

38:39.250 --> 38:42.583
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

38:42.687 --> 38:45.155
that we must find the book,
brew the potion...

38:45.289 --> 38:49.055
and suck the lives out of the children
of Salem before sunrise.

38:49.160 --> 38:54.291
Otherwise, it's curtains!
We evaporate! We cease to exist!

38:54.432 --> 38:56.957
Dost thou comprehend?

38:57.101 --> 38:58.625
You explained it
beautifully, Winnie.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.760
The way you sort of started out
with the adventure part...

39:00.871 --> 39:02.998
- and then you sort of slowly--
- Explained what?

39:04.175 --> 39:07.611
- Come! We fy!
- Fly!

39:07.712 --> 39:11.011
Because of me my little
sister's life was stolen.

39:11.148 --> 39:15.676
For years I waited for my life to end
so I could be reunited with my family.

39:15.820 --> 39:20.120
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.954
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

39:23.060 --> 39:26.826
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

39:26.964 --> 39:31.264
When Winifred and her sisters returned,
I'd be there to stop them.

39:31.369 --> 39:35.203
So for three centuries I've guarded
the house on All Hallows Night,

39:35.339 --> 39:38.467
when I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

39:38.576 --> 39:42.137
- Nice going, airhead.
- Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

39:44.048 --> 39:47.484
We're talking about three ancient hags
versus the 2Oth century.

39:47.585 --> 39:50.850
- How bad can it be?
- Bad.

39:50.988 --> 39:53.388
- Stay out of there!
- Why?

39:53.524 --> 39:56.982
It holds Winifred's most dangerous
spells. She must not get it.

39:57.094 --> 39:58.994
Well, let's torch the sucker.

40:06.337 --> 40:09.204
It's protected by magic.

40:15.713 --> 40:20.173
It's just a bunch
of hocus pocus!

40:20.284 --> 40:22.184
- Sarah!
- Mmm?

40:22.286 --> 40:24.550
Mary.

40:24.688 --> 40:28.419
- Max!
- Brave little virgin
who lit the candle.

40:28.559 --> 40:31.892
- I'll be thy friend.
- Hey, take a hike!

40:32.029 --> 40:33.860
Ooh! Ouch!

40:35.132 --> 40:39.364
- Book!
- Huh?

40:39.470 --> 40:42.098
- Come to Mommy!
- 'Fraid not!

40:42.239 --> 40:45.367
Thackery Binx,
thou mangy feline!

40:45.476 --> 40:47.706
- Still alive?
- And waiting for you!

40:47.812 --> 40:50.212
Ohh! Thou hast waited
in vain!

40:50.314 --> 40:52.407
And thou will fail
to save thy friends,

40:52.550 --> 40:54.916
just as thou failed
to save thy sister!

40:56.587 --> 40:58.555
Grab the book!

41:12.736 --> 41:16.103
- They can't touch us here, right?
- Well, they can't.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.302
I don't like the way
you said that.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.934
Unfaithful lover
long since dead,

41:22.079 --> 41:24.377
deep asleep in thy wormy bed,

41:24.482 --> 41:27.246
wiggle thy toes,
open thine eyes,

41:27.351 --> 41:30.411
twist thy fingers
toward the sky.

41:30.521 --> 41:33.081
Life is sweet.
Be not too shy.

41:33.190 --> 41:37.126
On thy feet, so sayeth I!

41:46.937 --> 41:48.802
Max! Max!

42:00.284 --> 42:02.149
Huh?

42:13.564 --> 42:15.623
Hi. Hello, Billy.

42:16.901 --> 42:19.495
Catch those children!
Get up!

42:19.637 --> 42:22.800
Get up! Get out of that ditch!
Faster!

42:32.349 --> 42:34.214
In here!

42:46.196 --> 42:47.561
Yes!

43:00.010 --> 43:02.137
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

43:02.246 --> 43:05.147
- What is this place, Binx?
- It's the old Salem crypt.
- Here, take the book.

43:05.249 --> 43:10.016
- It connects to the sewer
and up to the street.
- Oh. Uh, charming.

43:12.089 --> 43:15.684
- Uh, don't look up, Dani.
- Don't worry. I won't.

43:15.793 --> 43:18.921
Relax. I've hunted mice
down here for years.

43:19.063 --> 43:22.362
- Mice?
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. Just great.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.704
Oh, cheese and crust!
He's lost his head!

43:27.805 --> 43:30.774
Ha! Damn that Thackery Binx!
Damn him!

43:30.908 --> 43:34.071
Billy, which way did they go?
Aaah!

43:34.211 --> 43:36.236
Billy, listen to me.

43:36.380 --> 43:40.248
Follow those children,
you maggot museum, and get my book!

43:40.384 --> 43:44.377
Then come find us!
We'll be ready for them!

43:44.488 --> 43:47.924
Quit staring at me!
Get moving down that hole!

43:48.058 --> 43:49.889
- Damn, damn, double damn!
- Oh!

43:49.994 --> 43:51.723
Broom, ho!

43:53.564 --> 43:55.429
This way!

44:00.771 --> 44:02.739
- Broom, ho.
- Ahh.

44:05.109 --> 44:06.872
They're here.
I know they're here.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.741
- I know they're here,
but where are they?
- Winnie, look.

44:09.847 --> 44:13.578
- Sniff them out, Mary.
- Uh, they're, they're, uh--

44:13.684 --> 44:15.652
- Oh, I can't. They've gone too far.
- Aah!

44:15.786 --> 44:18.084
- I've lost them!
- Aaah!
- Aah!

44:18.188 --> 44:22.249
I'll have your guts for garters, girl!
Confound you!

44:22.359 --> 44:25.226
Very well.
We must outwit them.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.422
- When Billy the butcher
gets here with my book,
- Book!

44:27.531 --> 44:28.998
- we shall be ready for them!
- Ready!

44:29.133 --> 44:31.124
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

44:31.268 --> 44:34.135
- Let us start collecting children.
- Why?

44:35.873 --> 44:38.774
Because, you great buffoon,
we want to live forever,

44:38.876 --> 44:40.503
not just until tomorrow.

44:40.644 --> 44:43.670
The more children's lives we snatch,
the longer we shall live!

44:43.814 --> 44:47.011
- Right! Let us fy!
- Fly!
- Wait!

44:47.151 --> 44:50.814
Sisters. I have an idea.

44:50.954 --> 44:55.288
Since this promises to be a most
dire and stressful evening,

44:55.392 --> 44:58.122
I suggest we form
a calming circle.

44:58.228 --> 45:00.992
- I am calm!
- Oh, sister.

45:01.131 --> 45:06.159
Thou art not being honest
with thyself, are we? Huh? Huh?

45:06.303 --> 45:08.669
Come on. Come on.
Give me a smile.

45:19.883 --> 45:22.010
Come along. Not much further.

45:22.152 --> 45:25.383
Let's see. Which way, which way.
I can't remember. Oh! Look, down here!

45:25.723 --> 45:27.714
Think soothing thoughts.

45:27.858 --> 45:28.984
- Rabid bats.
- Yum!

45:29.093 --> 45:32.654
Black death.
Mummy's scorpion pie.

45:32.763 --> 45:34.663
- Mother.
- Mother.
- Mother.

45:41.939 --> 45:45.841
Bubble, bubble, I'm in trouble.

45:45.943 --> 45:48.377
Tell me, friend,
what is this contraption?

45:48.512 --> 45:51.379
I call it... a bus.

45:51.515 --> 45:53.574
- A bus.
- A bus?

45:53.717 --> 45:57.050
- And its purpose?
- To convey gorgeous creatures
such as yourselves...

45:57.187 --> 46:00.679
to your most forbidden desires.

46:02.359 --> 46:04.350
Well, fancy,

46:04.461 --> 46:06.361
we desire...

46:07.131 --> 46:09.190
children.

46:09.299 --> 46:12.359
Hey, that may take me a couple of tries,
but I don't think that'd be a problem.

46:12.469 --> 46:14.528
- Oh.
- Hop on up.
- Marvellous!

46:14.638 --> 46:16.037
Thank you.

46:17.207 --> 46:19.732
Thank you.

46:19.877 --> 46:22.072
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

46:22.212 --> 46:27.411
I need one of those instant ice packs.
You girls are giving me a fever! Yeow!

46:30.154 --> 46:33.055
- Go, Binx!
- Come here, you guys! This way!

46:40.998 --> 46:43.592
Hurry! Come on!

46:43.734 --> 46:45.599
Up the ladder!

46:47.271 --> 46:50.240
- Come on!
- Careful.

46:50.340 --> 46:55.403
Hey, buttercup, anybody ever tell you
you're very easy on the eyes?

47:01.618 --> 47:04.052
Binx! Look out!

47:04.154 --> 47:05.587
Whoa! Speed bump!

47:07.124 --> 47:10.787
- Binx! Ohh!
- Speed bump!

47:13.664 --> 47:15.928
Oh, my God.

47:16.033 --> 47:18.968
- No.
- It's all my fault.

47:20.671 --> 47:23.799
- Max, it's not your fault.
- Ohh.

47:28.212 --> 47:31.113
- Look!
- Max!

47:33.650 --> 47:35.743
I hate it when that happens.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.480
Well.

47:37.621 --> 47:41.113
I told you, I can't die.
Dani, you all right?

47:41.225 --> 47:43.125
- Yeah!
- Okay, then, let's go!

47:44.628 --> 47:47.324
Stop!

47:50.000 --> 47:53.299
- I smell children.
- Marvelous.

47:53.403 --> 47:56.304
Hey, hey, cupcake, don't I get
your phone number? Your area code?

47:56.406 --> 48:00.001
- You want my route schedule?
- Oh, thou wouldst hate me
in the morning.

48:00.143 --> 48:02.976
- No, I wouldnâ€™t.
- Oh, believe me, thou wouldst.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.378
Party pooper.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.817
What is this, sisters?

48:08.919 --> 48:10.853
Odds bodkins.

48:12.489 --> 48:14.514
Farewell, mortal bus boy.

48:14.658 --> 48:17.718
- Oh, my.
- What are those? What's that?

48:17.861 --> 48:19.351
- Um--
- What is that?
- Uh, hobgoblins.
- Oh.

48:19.496 --> 48:21.464
Ohh! Oh.

48:21.565 --> 48:22.862
Bless you.

48:27.004 --> 48:30.531
- Enough!
- Uh, sisters, I'm very confused.

48:30.674 --> 48:34.235
I-- I smell children,
but I-- I don't see children.

48:34.378 --> 48:37.313
I-- I've lost my power!

48:37.414 --> 48:40.076
- Enough, enough, enough!
- Sorry.

48:40.217 --> 48:41.844
- We are witches. We are evil!
- Evil.

48:41.952 --> 48:45.046
What would Mother say
if she could see us like this?

48:45.188 --> 48:46.883
Oh.

48:47.024 --> 48:48.889
- Mother.
- Mother.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.730
- Master!
- Master!
- Master! Ohh!

48:54.865 --> 48:56.730
- Oh, my!
- He will help us!

48:56.867 --> 49:00.894
- What kind of costumes are these?
- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

49:01.038 --> 49:03.199
It's the Sanderson Sisters,
right?

49:03.307 --> 49:06.401
-At your service.
-Yes, yes.
-Haven't seen you for centuries.

49:06.543 --> 49:11.742
But what the heck? Why don't you come
in? Come in to the non-smoking section.

49:11.882 --> 49:15.613
- Come on, come on, right this way.
- Oh, I can't believe it's him!

49:15.752 --> 49:17.686
Don't step on my tail!

49:21.224 --> 49:25.251
- Officer! Officer!
- Officer, we need your help.

49:25.395 --> 49:27.420
What's the problem?

49:27.564 --> 49:29.794
- Tell him.
- Go ahead.

49:29.933 --> 49:32.265
Well, um--

49:32.402 --> 49:35.098
Well, you see, for--
I just, I just moved here.

49:36.840 --> 49:41.038
W-Well, you see, i-it's like this.
I-- I, um--

49:41.144 --> 49:44.773
I broke into the old Sanderson
house and I brought the witches
back from the dead.

49:44.915 --> 49:47.076
See, I even have the book.

49:49.286 --> 49:52.414
- You lit the black fame candle?
- Yeah.

49:56.626 --> 49:59.959
Come on. Okay, let's
get on the sidewalk.

50:02.699 --> 50:04.758
And he's a virgin.

50:12.042 --> 50:13.942
Come here.

50:16.646 --> 50:20.275
- Are you a virgin?
- Yeah.

50:20.384 --> 50:22.284
Really.

50:22.386 --> 50:24.479
Look, I'll get it tattooed
on my forehead, okay?

50:24.621 --> 50:26.748
- Officer, this is not a prank.
- Really!

50:26.857 --> 50:31.453
Hey! I put my life on the line
to protect this community,
and you punks pull this?

50:31.561 --> 50:33.119
- Get outta here.
- Come on, Dani.

50:33.230 --> 50:35.130
And take that cat with ya.

50:39.803 --> 50:44.172
- What's so funny, Eddie?
- Ahh,just a bunch of kids
pullin' my chain.

50:47.477 --> 50:49.342
They thought I was a real cop.

51:07.998 --> 51:10.364
I want you to meet
the little woman.

51:12.102 --> 51:16.129
- He has a little woman.
- Sounds tasty.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.900
- Today--
-Swimmingpool, swimmingpool--

51:18.041 --> 51:20.407
- Petunia face.
- What?

51:20.544 --> 51:23.911
Would you stop clicking?
We have company!

51:24.047 --> 51:26.311
- I don't care who's here.
I'm sick and tired...
- Sisters.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.852
- of these dressing-up games.
- Satan has married Medusa.
See the snakes in her hair?

51:29.953 --> 51:32.717
- I don't wanna play in this.
I don't wanna play.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

51:34.758 --> 51:38.023
My three favorite witches.

51:38.128 --> 51:40.892
Arenâ€™t you broads a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

51:41.031 --> 51:44.694
- We'll be younger in the morning.
- Yes.

51:44.801 --> 51:48.737
- Yeah, sure. Me too.
- I went out with him Valentine's Day.

51:48.872 --> 51:50.396
Excuse me.

51:54.044 --> 51:57.571
Wow! Neat brooms!

52:01.885 --> 52:03.284
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

52:03.420 --> 52:05.547
Forget the kids.
I'm serving you from my cauldron.

52:05.655 --> 52:07.885
- Winnie!
- Yes?
- For you.

52:07.991 --> 52:11.085
Master, I plague thee.
What about the book?

52:11.228 --> 52:14.595
We'll get to the book later.
Mary, go long!

52:16.066 --> 52:18.432
Yeah! You could be
a tight end!

52:20.070 --> 52:23.597
Master, would thou
dance with me?

52:26.743 --> 52:28.768
Behold!

52:28.912 --> 52:30.777
A torture chamber.

52:40.924 --> 52:44.587
Honey, I lost five pounds
according to the bathroom--

52:44.694 --> 52:46.958
- Now there's a Stain master carpet...
- Master.

52:47.097 --> 52:49.588
that handles foot traffic
like never before.

52:51.601 --> 52:55.731
Okay, that's it. Party's over!

52:55.839 --> 53:00.742
Get out of my house!
Get outta here! Get outta my house!

53:00.844 --> 53:03.813
- Sorry.
- Calm down, puddin' face.

53:03.947 --> 53:06.006
- Shove it, Satan.
- Ohh.

53:06.149 --> 53:09.641
- Thou should not speak to
Master in such a manner.
- Mm-mmm.

53:09.786 --> 53:13.483
- They call me Master.
- Wait'll you see what
I'm gonna call ya.

53:13.623 --> 53:17.753
Now, tart face, take your Clark bars
and get out of my house!

53:19.362 --> 53:21.830
Make us!

53:21.965 --> 53:25.162
- Yeah!
- Honey bunch.

53:25.302 --> 53:28.169
Ralph! Sic 'em!

53:35.645 --> 53:37.670
Winnie! Winnie!

53:37.814 --> 53:40.180
- My broom!
- My broom!
- My broom!

53:40.317 --> 53:43.980
Purloined! Curses!

53:44.087 --> 53:47.955
Sisters, look. 'Tis the
chocolate-covered finger
of a man named Clark.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.686
Mmm. Ooh! Ugh!

53:50.827 --> 53:53.352
It's candy. Why would
the master give us candy?

53:53.496 --> 53:55.293
- Because he is not our master.
- He isn't?

53:55.398 --> 53:57.298
- And these are not hobgoblins.
- Ohh!

53:57.400 --> 53:59.061
- See?
- Ohh!
- Cool it, man!

53:59.202 --> 54:03.002
A child! Ohh!

54:03.106 --> 54:07.065
- Weirdos!
- Weirdos!
- Sisters!
- Mmm.

54:07.210 --> 54:10.236
- All Hallows Eve has become
a night of frolic...
- Oh.

54:10.380 --> 54:13.144
- where children wear costumes
and run amok!
- Oh!

54:13.250 --> 54:16.981
Amok! Amok, amok,
amok, amok, amok--

54:17.087 --> 54:20.420
- Oh, Winnie, just one child.
- No!

54:20.557 --> 54:24.152
Ah, great. How are we ever gonna
find Mom and Dad in this place?

54:26.096 --> 54:28.257
Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

54:33.937 --> 54:36.838
Owww! Whoo!

54:39.542 --> 54:42.443
Those fingers through my hair

54:42.579 --> 54:45.742
Thatsly ''come hit her''stare

54:45.882 --> 54:48.009
That strips my conscience bare

54:48.118 --> 54:50.177
It's witchcraft

54:50.287 --> 54:52.221
- I'm gonna look for Mom.
- Baby!

54:52.322 --> 54:55.416
-And I got no defense for it
- I can't see a thing!

54:55.558 --> 54:58.550
- Whoo! Waah! Whoo!
- The heat is too intense for it

54:58.662 --> 55:03.361
What good would
common sense for it do

55:03.466 --> 55:05.366
- Aaah!
- It's witchcraft

55:05.468 --> 55:09.962
- Oh. Dad!
- It's not Dad. It's '' Dadcula.''

55:10.106 --> 55:14.805
Oh, my goodness. Who must this
charming young blood donor be?

55:14.944 --> 55:17.640
Dad! Something terrible
happened.

55:17.781 --> 55:20.807
- Dani? What's wrong? Wh-Wh--
- No, Dani's fine.

55:20.950 --> 55:23.248
Good. Excuse me. Come here.

55:27.290 --> 55:29.155
Mom?

55:34.097 --> 55:36.657
- Mom?
- Hmm?

55:36.800 --> 55:39.394
What are you supposed to be?

55:39.502 --> 55:41.936
Madonna.

55:42.038 --> 55:46.407
Well, you know--
Well, obviously. Don't ya think?

55:46.509 --> 55:50.912
Shoot, Max. Look,
whatever it is, just tell me.

55:51.014 --> 55:52.914
- Come here.
- What?

55:53.016 --> 55:55.314
This cat here, Binx, right?
He can talk.

55:55.452 --> 55:57.579
My brother's a virgin:
he lit the black fame candle.

55:57.687 --> 56:00.520
The witches are back from the dead
and they're after us. We need help.

56:00.657 --> 56:02.648
How much candy
have you had, honey?

56:02.792 --> 56:05.260
Mom, I haven't O.D.'d.
I haven't even had a piece.

56:05.362 --> 56:09.696
They're real witches, they can
fy, and they're gonna eat all
the kids in Salem. They're real!

56:09.833 --> 56:13.701
All right, let's just
find your father.

56:13.837 --> 56:16.772
It's such an ancient pitch

56:16.873 --> 56:20.036
But one I wouldn't switch

56:20.176 --> 56:23.270
- 'Cause there's non icer witch
- Slither about.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.678
- Find them!
- Oh, no, I'll never switch

56:25.815 --> 56:28.943
- Ohh! Aah!
- 'Cause there's non icer witch

56:29.052 --> 56:31.953
Than you

56:32.055 --> 56:34.615
I put a spell on you

56:34.724 --> 56:38.353
And now you're mine

56:38.495 --> 56:40.554
- Max, I love you, but enough is enough.
- Come on, Dad, if I was
gonna pull your chain--

56:40.697 --> 56:42.528
- Now, just calm down.
- But they're gonna come--

56:42.665 --> 56:45.133
- Don't you see how crazy this sounds?
- Max! Max!

56:45.235 --> 56:48.068
- Max, really--

56:51.674 --> 56:54.541

57:10.093 --> 57:12.653
- Hey, cut the music! Cut the music!
- Hey, man, I'm in the middle of a song!

57:12.762 --> 57:15.595
It's an emergency!
Only for a minute!

57:15.732 --> 57:18.530
Will everybody listen up,
please?

57:18.635 --> 57:20.398
- No. Youâ€™re just getting
everybody worked up.
- Well, listen to him.
Listen to him. He's fine!

57:20.537 --> 57:23.233
- Your kids are in danger.
- What do you mean?

57:23.373 --> 57:26.900
3OO years ago the Sanderson
Sisters bewitched people.

57:27.043 --> 57:30.012
Now they've returned
from their grave.

57:30.113 --> 57:32.240
Hey, man, I'm serious!
It's not a joke!

57:32.382 --> 57:33.906
- All right, this has gone far enough.
- No, wait a minute.

57:34.050 --> 57:36.075
I know this sounds dumb,

57:36.219 --> 57:38.084
but they're here tonight.

57:38.221 --> 57:40.382
They're right over there!

57:44.461 --> 57:46.361
- Aah!
- Ohh.
- Wow.
- Thank you, Max,

57:48.431 --> 57:51.594
for that marvelous introduction.

57:53.403 --> 57:57.362
i put a spell on you

57:57.474 --> 57:59.874
And now you're mine

58:01.611 --> 58:05.809
You can't stop
the things I do

58:05.949 --> 58:09.441
- I ain't lyin'
- No! No!

58:09.586 --> 58:10.985
- Ohh
- Don't listen to them!

58:11.120 --> 58:12.917
Been3OOyears

58:13.022 --> 58:15.252
Right down to the day

58:15.358 --> 58:17.553
Now the witch is back

58:17.660 --> 58:21.289
And there's hell to pay

58:21.431 --> 58:25.299
i put a spell on you

58:25.435 --> 58:27.903
- Good joke. Happy Halloween.
Thanks a lot.

All right. Yeah, gear up.
Let's go, guys.

58:37.814 --> 58:40.146
Hello, Salem!

58:40.283 --> 58:43.446
My name's Winifred!
What's yours?

58:43.553 --> 58:45.987
i put a spell on you

58:46.122 --> 58:49.819
-And now you're gone
- Gone, gone, gone, so long

58:49.959 --> 58:52.655
My whammy fell on you

58:52.795 --> 58:56.322
-And it was strong
-So strong, so strong, so strong

58:56.466 --> 58:59.367
Your wretched little lives
have all been cursed

58:59.502 --> 59:02.665
'Cause of all the witches
working I'm the worst

59:02.805 --> 59:05.137
i put a spell on you

59:05.241 --> 59:08.540
-And now you're mine
- Binx, where are you?

59:10.179 --> 59:12.613
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out

59:15.652 --> 59:19.383
If you don't believe
you'd better get superstitious

59:19.522 --> 59:22.355
-Ask my sisters
- Mom! Dad! Thank God!
- Hey, Max, great show.

59:22.492 --> 59:25.290
- Cover your ears!
- Cover our ears!
- i put a spell on you

59:27.196 --> 59:29.357
What? Ho-ho! Uh-oh!

59:29.499 --> 59:33.731
- i put a spell on you
- Oh, I wish we had a camera.

59:33.870 --> 59:36.964
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

59:37.073 --> 59:40.065
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

59:40.209 --> 59:43.235
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma

59:43.379 --> 59:44.812
- Hey
- Hey!
- High
- High!

59:44.914 --> 59:46.313
-Say
- Say!
- Bye
- Bye!

59:46.416 --> 59:50.409
Bye

59:50.553 --> 59:52.248
Bye-bye

59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.530
Dance! Dance!
Dance until you die!

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.105
Oh, Binx, come on!

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:24.380
- This is really bad!
- Max, come on! Calm down!

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:27.456
Look, I want you to take Dani
back to your house and don't
let her out of your sight!

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.854
Max, I'm not leaving you.

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:34.260
Okay, guys, who's goin'
for the jacuzzi?

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:38.359
Yeah, Angelo, too bad.

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:45.264
- Uh-oh.
- Get down!

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.601
- I smell--
- Yes?

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.941
- Winnie, I smell--
- Yes? Yes?

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:55.448
I smell scrod.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.450
Scrod. You know.
It's a bottom dweller.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:59.782
You cook it sometimes with lovely
bread crumbs, little bit of margarine.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.719
Or oil. Olive oil is good.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:05.726
But you have to cook it at 35O degrees
or else it tastes really-- Aah!

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:08.558
Sarah. Sarah!

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.409
I have an idea.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:30.646
- What is this place?
- Mmm, it reeks of children.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:33.187
It is a prison for children.

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:44.662
Welcome to High School Hell.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:48.168
I'm your host,
Boris Karloff Jr.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:53.441
This way. I know I'm right.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.512
It's time to meet
our three contestants:

01:01:56.646 --> 01:02:00.946
Sarah, Mary
and Winifred Sanderson.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.450
Read any good spellbooks
lately?

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.622
Hag tracks!

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.357
Get him!

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:16.658
Hello. Welcome to the library.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.868
I would like a book.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.246
Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:36.351
What kind of book
are you looking for?

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:41.022
We've got them!
We've got them, we've got them!

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.252
- What? Hello.
- I am looking for a children's book
- Yes?

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.703
- Wretches!
- It's warm in here.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.708
Fire. Fire!

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.910
Aah! It's hot! It's hot!

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.117
Farewell, Winifred Sanderson!
Ha ha!

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.885
- Yes! Yay!
- Burn! Burn! All right!

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.224
Whoo! Whoo!

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.958
Yeah! All right!

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.401
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.636
Yes!

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.148
We did it, Binx.
We stopped them.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:46.813
I've wanted to do that for 3OO
years, since they took Emily.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.326
You really miss her, donâ€™t you?

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:57.660
Man, you can't keep blaming yourself
for that. That happened so long ago.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.893
Take good care of Dani, Max.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:04.496
You'll never know how precious
she is until you lose her.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:13.779
Hey, Binx! Where do you
think youâ€™re goin'?

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.852
You're a Dennison now, buddy.
One of us.

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:19.682
Come on, Binx, let's go home.

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:22.120
Home.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:24.953
Home.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:34.695
Mom? Dad?

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:38.102
We got a new cat! Mom?

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:42.709
Well, I guess they're
still partying. Come on in.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.883
You're my kitty now.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:59.324
You'll have milk and tuna fish every
day, and you'll only hunt mice for fun.

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:03.888
You're going to turn me into
one of those fat, useless,
contented house cats.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.898
You betcha.

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:13.334
- Yeah.
- You know, Binx,
I'll always take care of you.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.967
My children will
take care of you too.

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:21.414
And then their children after
that, and theirs after that,

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:25.748
forever and ever...

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:28.254
and ever.

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:57.545
Hello. I want my book.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:07.694
- You wanna smash some pumpkins?
- Nah.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.960
Well, then you wanna look in
windows and watch babes undress?

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.762
It's 3:OO.
They're undressed already.

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:20.807
- Well, then you think of something!
- I don't feel so good.

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:24.140
- It's 'cause you're eatin'
too much candy, ya oinker!
- Seek them out, Mary.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.612
- Seek them out.
- Okay, Winnie.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.318
- Yes!
- Yo, witch. Get your face off my shoe.

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:38.825
- Uhh, wrong boy.
- Natch!
- Ohh, sorry, Winnie.

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:43.057
Why, why, why was I cursed
with such idiot sisters?

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.598
-Just lucky, I guess.
- Ohh!

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:52.436
Oh, man, how come it's always
the ugly chicks that stay out late?

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:57.512
Chicks?

01:06:57.646 --> 01:07:01.946
We haven't much time left!
We shall have to-- We shall have
to make the potion from memory!

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.246
Hey! Let us outta here!

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:07.845
- Yeah, we're really sorry.
- We think youâ€™re really cute.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:09.753
- Hush!
- Aaah!

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.521
- I've got to think.
- Ohh.

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:15.494
- Please!
- Remember. Remember.

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.622
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:20.668
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Now I remember!

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.703
- I was here.
- Yes.
- The book was there.
- Uh--

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:26.535
You, Mary, you were here. Sarah, you
were in the back, dancing idiotically.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.939
- And the book said--
- Yes?
- I remember it like it was yesterday.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:33.982
- Yes?
- Oil of boil...
- Mmm?
- and a dead man's nose.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.313
- Dead man's toes!
- She's trying to concentrate!

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.148
- No.
- Go! Go, go, go!

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.654
- His thumbs.
- Thumbs? Could be thumbs.
- Or was it his gums?

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:43.316
- I don't know. Thumbs, gums.
- Or dead man's buns.
- Dead man's buns. Buns.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:44.893
- Sounds like--
- Mums?
- Mums.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.892
- Funs.
- Funs.
- Chungs?
- Chungs? Mmm!

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:50.328
- It's chungs!
- Chungs?
- Dead man's chungs!

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:53.027
There is no such thing
as chungs.

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.727
- You're right.
- I am? I'm right?

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.896
It's no use. I don't
remember the ingredients.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.840
I-- I-- I've got to
have my book!

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:10.013
- Leave him alone!
- Aaah! I'm gonna puke!

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:14.216
Book!

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:18.224
Come home
or make thyself known!

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.210
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.549
Oh, my God. It's 5:OO.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:48.555
My parents are gonna kill me.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:52.787
- I should go.
- I wish you could stay.

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.696
Poor Binx.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.270
Yeah. Poor Binx.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:09.410
- We owe him a lot.
- Yeah.

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:13.413
Look, cou-- could we find
some kind of way to help him?

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.609
The book.

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:21.621
The witches used it to put
the spell on him.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:24.624
Maybe there's a way in here
to take it off.

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:29.995
Mmm, I don't know.
Binx told us not to open it.

01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:32.999
Well, the witches are dead.
What harm could it do?

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:40.903
Well, just be careful.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.478
I will.

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:46.240
- Hold my hand.
- All right.

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.850
Nothing weird so far.

01:09:56.992 --> 01:10:00.018
Winnie, oh, do you wanna hit me?
Would that cheer you up?

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:04.292
- Okay. There you go.
- This is the end.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.698
- No.
- I feel it.
- Okay.

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:11.772
We are doomed. I feel
the icy breath of death upon my neck.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.669
- Mary?
- What?
- Take me to the window.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.301
- This one?
- I wish to say good-bye.

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:18.880
Yes, Winnie.

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:20.379
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:23.041
- Good-bye, cruel world.
- Bye-bye, cruel world.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.278
- Good-bye to life.
- Bye-bye, life.

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:28.049
- Good-bye, good-bye.
- Good-bye-bye.

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.215
- Good-bye to all that.
- To all that.

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:35.186
- Sister! Observe!
- What?
- They've opened it!

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:37.959
Ha ha! Just when our time
was running out!

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:42.902
- Come! We fy!
- We fy! On what do we fy?

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:56.651
Ahh! Into the night! Ahh!

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.265
Winnie?

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:18.862
Broom, ho!

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.942
Ohh!

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.948
Oh, listen to this.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:31.451
Only a circle of salt can protect
thy victims from thy power.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.964
- We were just trying to help you.
- Well, don't!

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:46.192
Nothing good can come
from this book. You got it?

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.714
- Maybe we should go now.
- Okay.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.420
Mom? Dad?

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.633
Still not home. That's weird.

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:23.829
Must be having a great time.

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.907
I don't know.
Something's not right.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.672
I'd feel a lot safer walking
home if we had some salt.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.185
Salt.

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.194
Ahh!

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.858
What's it say?

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:56.664
Uh, it says form a circle of
salt to protect from zombies,

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:59.137
witches and old boyfriends.

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:01.141
Yeah? And what about
new boyfriends?

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.044
Dani.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.457
Dani!

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.232
Max, the book is gone.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:31.505
I'm telling you,
something's weird.

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.343
- Dani, wake up.
- Trick or treat!

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:40.411
- Looking for this?
- Or this?

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:49.189
Boy down.

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:53.990
Salt! Ha!

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:57.259
- What a clever little white witch.
- Yeah!

01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:00.163
But it will not save
thy friends. No.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:03.238
Come, sisters. The candle's
magic is almost spent.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.932
- Dawn approaches.
- Bye-bye.

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.872
Max!

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:13.038
Put me down! Let me go!
Aaah! Put me down!

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:22.115
Dani? Dani?

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:28.724
Dani!

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.127
Max. Max.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.239
- Ohh.
- Get up.
- Ohh.
- Are you okay?

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.865
- Ohh.
- Come on, get up.
- Where's Dani?

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:45.306
Use thy voice, Sarah!
Fill the sky!

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:48.314
Bring the little brats to die!

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:56.486
Come, little children

01:14:56.625 --> 01:15:00.755
I'll take thee away

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:03.798
Into a land

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:08.426
Of enchantment

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.995
Come, little children

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.076
The time's come to play

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:19.670
Here in my garden

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:24.912
Of magic

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.024
- Dani!
- Dani!

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:42.032
Hey! Hey, you guys!

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:46.266
Don't listen to her!
Hey! Up here!

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:49.776
- Don't listen to her!
- Max! Max, I've figured it out.

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:53.006
- What?
- Winifred said...

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.673
the candle's magic
will soon be spent...

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:58.149
and dawn approaches.

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:02.383
The black fame candle only brought
them back for this one Halloween night.

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:05.391
And unless they can steal
the lives of children,

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:09.019
when the sun comes up
they're dust.

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.860
Yeah, but how can we
make the sun come up?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.197
They've got Dani.

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.669
We need a miracle.

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.858
The children are coming.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.191
- Ohh! Well done, sister Sarah.
- Mmm! Good, good, good, good!

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.862
Let me out of here!

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.698
Hurry, okay? Oh, watch out!

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:56.767
Come on! Get out of the way!
Move it!

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:03.012
- Aaah! I'm gonna ralph.
- Open up!

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:05.450
No more candy, please!
Oww! Oww!

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:09.045
- Soon the lives of all thy
little friends will be mine,
- Oww! Oww!

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:11.955
and I shall be young
and beautiful again forever.

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:16.224
It doesn't matter how young or old
you are! You sold your soul!

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:20.358
You're the ugliest thing that's
ever lived, and you know it!

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:24.604
You die first.

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:47.423
- No!
- Ahh! 'Tis ready!

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:49.429
- Pry open her mouth.
- Gladly.

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:51.499
- Dani, don't drink it!
- Shut up, you!

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.567
- Don't drink it, Dani!
- Come on, open your mouth.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:56.729
- Open up--
- Aah!
- Aah! She bit me!

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:01.500
She bit me, Winnie!

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.277
Prepare to die!

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.309
- Again.
- You!

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:08.507
- You have no powers here, you fool!
- Hollywood!

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:11.619
- Maybe not!
- Come here!
- But there's a power
greater than your magic,

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.120
- and that's knowledge!
- Hey, come on, man!

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:17.749
- And there's one thing that
I know that you don't!
- Ohh!

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.759
And what is that, dude?

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.524
Daylight savings time.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:26.099
'' Daylight savings time.''

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.763
- Winnie!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.363
The sun! No!

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:36.944
- Max! Get me out of here!
- The sun!

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.709
It hurts!

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.813
- Don't worry, Binx!
I've got you! I'm here!
- Aah! Hot! Hot cat! Hot cat!

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:49.550
Hey! Let me outta here!

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:55.223
Help! Help! Hey! Hollywood!
Help us out here.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:03.737
- Tubular.
- Aaah! Aaah!

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:07.735
- Yes!
- Let me outta here, man!

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:10.640
- Come on, Dani, let's go!
- Let me outta here, man!

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:13.909
Max! I wanna see her
turn to dust!

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.084
Pump it!

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.254
Allison!

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.596
I am alive!

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.174
Damn that boy.
He's tricked us again.

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:44.336
- Oh, you're right. You're always right.
I don't know how you do it--
- It's my curse!

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:49.349
- That, and you two. Get off me,
you thundering oafs!
- Ohh! Sorry.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:53.444
Look! The candle's almost out,
and my potion--

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:55.783
My beautiful potion.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:20:01.123
Look! There's just
enough left for one child.

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:02.787
Get the vial.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.730
Come on! Move it!

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.735
Oh, joy! What luck!

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:11.704
This is perfect for that
little towheaded brat.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.799
- We have a child.
- Him!
- Him!

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:19.642
And look, Winnie, more children
are arriving. Come on in.

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:25.151
Winnie. Winnie, we will make more potion
because, Winnie, we have the book!

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:26.982
We haven't the time!

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:30.819
Besides, I want to get that little
rat-faced kid that called me--

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:33.928
- Oh! Oh, don't say it.
Don't even say it.
- Ugly?

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:40.131
- Oh, honey. I know.
- She really hurt my feelings.

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:43.567
- She's jealous.
- She doesn't even know me!
- I know. I know. And she said--

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.835
- You know, I always wanted a child.
- I know.

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:49.841
- And now I think I'll have one.
- Mm-hmm?

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:51.809
On toast!

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:56.944
- Step on it, Max!
- Are they following us?

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.686
- No.
- Good.

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:14.030
Pull over! Let me see
your driver's permit.

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:27.471
Resisting arrest?
Aah! Whoa!

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:31.382
- Yee-hah!
- Way to go!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.549
Hurry! Hurry!

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:41.059
- Run!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.892
Come on! Let's get a move on!

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.469
- Max!
- No, wait, Dani!

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.811
Run, Dani, run! Come on!

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.878
Billy! Billy, listen to me!

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:06.681
Kill him if you must!
just bring me that child, that Dani!

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:11.521
And put some wiggle in it,
you putrid, festering sore!

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.151
Don't dawdle! Come along now!

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:19.556
Come along now! Kill him!

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.601
Do it now!

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:26.173
Wench! Trollop!

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:31.268
You bucktoothed,
mop-riding firefy from hell!

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:35.440
- Aaah!
- I've waited centuries to say that.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:37.949
Well, say what you want.
just don't breathe on me.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:40.919
Billy! I killed you once!

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:44.685
I shall kill you again,
you maggoty malfeasance!

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:48.524
Hang on to your head!

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.897
- Max, run!
- Max, come on, move!
Move out of the way!

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:58.098
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait!
No! No. No.

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:01.299
He's a good zombie. Come on.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:07.543
Come on, then. We'll have to hold them
out until dawn. It's our only hope.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.581
Hi, Billy.

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.754

For the last time,
