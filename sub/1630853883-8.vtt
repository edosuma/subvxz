00:07.883 --> 00:10.302
But since I got out,
there's this place I've been going to.

00:11.303 --> 00:14.431
There's a minister there, Dr. Payne.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.603
He's all about this shit called,
um, personal accountability.

00:20.938 --> 00:24.149
And part of that is facing up to people
that you've hurt in the past,

00:25.651 --> 00:27.027
making amends and shit.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.696
So I came here today to,

00:31.114 --> 00:32.533

00:35.244 --> 00:37.287
that I deeply regret
shooting you in the ass.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.625
You know, it was funny to me at the time,

00:41.625 --> 00:45.045
but now I realize that
even though it was super funny,

00:46.380 --> 00:47.673
it was also wrong.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.884
So I just wanna say to you...

00:50.884 --> 00:52.094
that I'm sorry--

You didn't shoot me in my ass.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.647

01:07.484 --> 01:09.027
- Nah, homey, I'm pretty sure it was me.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.197
'Cause I actually remember
I was gonna shoot you in the leg,

01:12.197 --> 01:14.116
but then at the last second I thought,
"Ah, fuck it.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.577
It'll be funnier
if I shoot him in the ass."

01:16.577 --> 01:18.537

the ass would be funnier?

01:19.121 --> 01:20.539

all the evil shit that I did.

01:32.384 --> 01:33.844

01:34.845 --> 01:36.638

21:51.311 --> 21:53.522
- They called me dick girl
for a whole year.

21:53.522 --> 21:54.565
LUIS:
I know.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.775
I was also one of the fools
that called you that.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.194
My primo Johnny,

22:00.487 --> 22:01.947
sorry that I slept with your wife.

22:02.865 --> 22:04.408
What up, Myra? [whistles]

22:04.408 --> 22:05.492
That wasn't right, primo.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.953
Even if it was only because
you weren't putting it down.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.998
- Luis, stay on track, buddy.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.708
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Nah, this feels good.

22:13.292 --> 22:14.293
Right, minister, thank you.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.170
To my tío Eugenio,

22:17.421 --> 22:18.672
I'm sorry for robbing you

22:19.339 --> 22:20.632
and for making fun of you

22:20.632 --> 22:22.384
because you were so scared
that you pissed your pants.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.428
That shit was hilarious.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.305
But perdon, tío.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.515
And, Ana,

22:29.141 --> 22:31.059
I'm sorry I made your homegirl Loretta cry

22:31.059 --> 22:32.853
because she had a big forehead
and I called her Forhedda,

22:32.853 --> 22:35.022
and all the homeys was like, Damn,
my boy has to go," and I say, "Yeah."

22:35.022 --> 22:36.607
But looking back on it, that wasn't right.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.194
I'm sorry to my homie Spider.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.613
Sorry that I borrowed money from you.

22:42.613 --> 22:45.073
And then paid you back
with money that I stole from you.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.658
That wasn't right, big dawg.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.578
But my advice is, you know,
keep your feria in a safe.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.289
To my cousin Miguel,

22:52.289 --> 22:55.584
I'm sorry that whenever we played,
I always socked you in your face.

22:56.210 --> 22:58.253
But you gotta practice
your self-defense, my boy.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.714
And my tía Sofia,

23:00.714 --> 23:03.634
perdón por robarle
el catalítico a tu carro.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.512
And to my cousin Ricky,

23:06.512 --> 23:08.680
I'm sorry that one time
the police pulled us over

23:08.680 --> 23:09.932
and I had that gun on me.

23:09.932 --> 23:11.808
And, you know, I just said it was yours.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.269
Because I remember you saying
you loved that movie Blood In, Blood Out.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.271
So I said, fuck it,
let that fool experience

23:16.271 --> 23:18.023
prison if he loves that movie so much.

23:18.023 --> 23:19.441
Lo siento, primo.
