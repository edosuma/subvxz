01:15.123 --> 01:18.251
What part did you play in the
recent local elections, Mr. Rienzi?

01:18.293 --> 01:21.463
You got me mixed up with
somebody else, senator.

01:21.547 --> 01:23.966
I'm in the cement and
contracting business.

01:24.049 --> 01:25.926
What would you say your
earnings are per year?

01:25.968 --> 01:28.387
Around 20,000 or 30,000.

01:28.429 --> 01:32.016
Say 30,000. You've got
a $60,000 home here.

01:32.058 --> 01:35.520
A winter place in Miami.
A summer place in Maine.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.565
Two limousines.
A sailboat worth 50,000.

01:38.649 --> 01:42.945
All on $30,000 a year.
How do you do it, Mr. Rienzi?

01:43.028 --> 01:46.115
Sometimes I wonder myself, senator.

01:48.326 --> 01:50.828
It was testified here yesterday
that you were paid...

01:50.954 --> 01:54.374
$200,000 in cash to, uh,
influence the election.

01:54.416 --> 01:57.210
Yeah, I read that in the papers.

01:57.294 --> 01:59.963
Now, if somebody'll only tell me
where all that money is hiding

02:00.047 --> 02:02.967
- You deny meddling in the election?
- Does it look like it?

02:03.050 --> 02:06.012
After all, you got elected,
didn't you, senator?

02:23.322 --> 02:27.827
Fire swept through
upper floors of hospital...

02:29.287 --> 02:31.289
You say this man keeps
getting undressed...

02:31.372 --> 02:33.416
without pulling down the shades?

02:33.458 --> 02:35.502
Well, what's your complaint, madam?
Boy!

02:35.585 --> 02:37.587
Here.

02:40.757 --> 02:44.303
Well, from the condition of the body, she'd
been soaking in the river for several days.

02:44.428 --> 02:46.472
This fur coat she wore
was all she had on.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.683
Well, maybe she was
a rich society matron.

02:48.766 --> 02:51.519
Mink isn't class-Conscious,
Sonny. No.

02:51.603 --> 02:53.646
No other clothes, no identification...

02:53.688 --> 02:56.900
Mr. Hutcheson wants to
see you in his office, sir.

02:56.983 --> 02:59.152
Boy!

03:05.910 --> 03:07.828
What about the Rienzi story,
George?

03:07.870 --> 03:09.997
Boss wants to check it first.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.939
One column head three line bank.

03:33.022 --> 03:35.066
A.P. Says the paper's being sold.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.861
What? Sold? Who to? When?

03:37.903 --> 03:41.281
- What about that, Frank?
- That's something only the Garrison heirs,

03:41.365 --> 03:43.617
Hutcheson and the gods
would know, not us.

03:43.701 --> 03:47.038
It's a conspiracy to keep you
just as you are, nice and ignorant.

03:47.079 --> 03:49.415
Sold. I can't believe it.

03:49.499 --> 03:51.542
Don't believe the associated press?

03:51.584 --> 03:54.504
- My, my.
- Maine 2000.

03:54.587 --> 03:56.590
Better run for your lives, men.

03:56.673 --> 03:59.176
And don't forget to trample
the women, loudmouth.

03:59.259 --> 04:01.970
Record?
Give me the city desk.

04:02.054 --> 04:04.974
Look, who's the boss?
Who says what goes in the paper?

04:05.057 --> 04:07.935
The managing editor, Mr. Hutcheson.
Then he's the man I want to see.

04:07.977 --> 04:11.064
Well, right now, he's busier than
a bird dog. Why don't you sit down?

04:11.105 --> 04:13.108
If you don't mind.

04:13.191 --> 04:15.902
He's still in a makeup conference.
Call him, call him.

04:15.944 --> 04:18.822
Credit controls. Inflation
to be halted. Billions.

04:18.904 --> 04:20.908
Yes? Frank Allen. Urgent.

04:21.033 --> 04:23.619
Okay. Billions required.

04:23.661 --> 04:27.498
National budget.
O.P.S., N.A.M., P.C.A.

04:27.707 --> 04:31.336
What's all this mean
to the reader?

04:31.544 --> 04:34.172
Consumption tax? Huh,
sounds like a disease.

04:34.297 --> 04:37.050
It'll be page one in every paper
in the country. In the day too.

04:37.134 --> 04:39.761
What does this tax program mean
to the average man and woman?

04:39.845 --> 04:42.848
Not billions, that's an impossible
figure. Here, break it down.

04:42.931 --> 04:45.518
Yes, sir. What'll it cost the
housewife for groceries?

04:45.559 --> 04:49.063
How much more for a car? A radio?
Fifty bucks? A hundred? How much?

04:49.147 --> 04:52.192
Run the story as is, page one.
New lead for the second edition.

04:52.275 --> 04:54.361
Right.

04:54.444 --> 04:56.780
United press flood story
in same slot?

04:56.863 --> 05:00.033
- Pictures come in yet?
- With casualty lists.

05:00.117 --> 05:02.077
All right. Yes, Frank. Ed.

05:06.582 --> 05:08.835
What about the dead nude murder story?

05:08.918 --> 05:10.920
- Is it murder?
- Looks like it.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.923
Looks like it! Who is she?

05:14.007 --> 05:16.676
I don't know yet. Got some
pictures of her though.

05:16.718 --> 05:18.720
Very interesting.

05:20.764 --> 05:22.766
Put 'em on postcards
and send 'em to Paris.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.436
- Second section. Play it down. No pictures. - Yes, sir.

05:25.519 --> 05:27.897
Story's fine, George.
Tie it off.

05:28.022 --> 05:30.108
Yes?

05:30.233 --> 05:32.902
- You're late for the dome.
- Okay.

05:32.986 --> 05:35.196
Can you leave tonight to
handle that strike upstate?

05:35.280 --> 05:37.365
Oh, I'd like to stay
with the Rienzi story.

05:37.407 --> 05:40.202
- You're wasting your time, baby.
- Not if we can prove he's guilty.

05:40.285 --> 05:42.287
It's not our job to prove he's guilty.

05:42.329 --> 05:44.748
We're not detectives, and we're
not in the crusading business.

05:44.832 --> 05:48.002
- Gimme a week.
- Forget it. State senate couldn't prove anything.

05:48.085 --> 05:50.129
Neither could that probe
four years ago.

05:50.171 --> 05:53.675
We've had a nice circus, that's all.
Television's had a field day,

05:53.717 --> 05:56.469
All the papers raised their circulation,

05:56.595 --> 05:58.555
And Rienzi's lawyers got richer.

05:58.639 --> 06:02.142
One week. Three days.
Please, I got a good lead.

06:04.270 --> 06:07.690
All right. Stay out of trouble.

06:09.984 --> 06:12.111
Ed.

06:12.237 --> 06:15.031
That's right, Frank.
Baby's on the auction block.

06:15.156 --> 06:20.204
But we're the best outfit in town, in
the country maybe. But why? Why sell?

06:20.245 --> 06:23.832
Money. That's usually the reason
something is sold, isn't it?

06:23.916 --> 06:26.001
Tell 'em I'm on my way up.

06:26.043 --> 06:28.838
The heirs and the lawyers are
up in the dome right now...

06:28.880 --> 06:32.342
waiting to explain the nature of
their crime with facts, figures...

06:32.425 --> 06:34.469
and falsehoods.

06:34.511 --> 06:37.055
One more "f" and they won't be drafted.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.268
But, mother,
the paper belongs to us.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.437
Why do we have to go
to court to sell it?

06:43.520 --> 06:45.940
Perhaps because we never
intended it to be sold.

06:46.023 --> 06:48.943
Oh, please, mother. We've
been over that a hundred times.

06:49.026 --> 06:51.279
The surrogates court will
decide that, Mrs. Garrison.

06:51.321 --> 06:53.198
- Ed.
- Mrs. Garrison.

06:53.281 --> 06:54.741
What kept you so long?

06:54.783 --> 06:56.785
- How is the expectant mother?
- Lousy.

06:56.827 --> 06:58.912
- Hello, Ed.
- Alice.

06:59.037 --> 07:01.331
- You're looking very well.
- Thank you. How's your husband?

07:01.415 --> 07:04.084
- Oh, fine. Just fine.
- It's fine, isn't it?

07:04.168 --> 07:07.296
- Let's get this over with.
- I suppose you know why we're here, Mr. Hutcheson.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.383
Practically everybody seems to know
except the people who work here.

07:10.425 --> 07:14.846
We're sorry about that. We thought it best
to make a general announcement discretely.

07:14.888 --> 07:17.599
The death of a newspaper
is never discreet.

07:17.682 --> 07:19.851
Here we go again.

07:19.935 --> 07:22.730
The last will and testament
of the late John Garrison,

07:22.771 --> 07:25.149
Drawn up just prior to
his death 11 years ago,

07:25.232 --> 07:28.402
Designated as his heirs
his eldest daughter Alice,

07:28.486 --> 07:32.407
His daughter Katherine
and his wife Margaret.

07:32.490 --> 07:35.368
Inasmuch as Katherine attained
her majority last week...

07:35.452 --> 07:37.537
and became entitled to a full vote,

07:37.621 --> 07:40.040
- It was decided by the three stockholders
- Decided?

07:40.165 --> 07:43.168
- Unanimously?
- Of course.

07:43.252 --> 07:46.047
Uh, any objections?

07:46.130 --> 07:48.216
Would it make any difference?

07:48.257 --> 07:51.928
- None.
- Then I have no objections.

07:51.970 --> 07:55.098
- The reason it was decided
- Must we go into detail?

07:55.181 --> 07:57.267
I don't feel well.

07:57.434 --> 07:59.645
My entire staff feels the same way.

07:59.728 --> 08:03.023
Oh, Ed. What do Alice or
I know about newspapers?

08:03.065 --> 08:05.067
Gives you an income.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.862
We never even come down here
except twice a year for meetings.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.031
You're invited every day.

08:10.114 --> 08:13.618
Mrs. Courtney's husband feels the money
could be invested more wisely elsewhere.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.705
John Garrison founded this paper,
not Mrs. Courtney's husband.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.790
- We're taking care of you, Ed.
- What?

08:18.874 --> 08:21.794
- We always try anyhow.
- You're to get one percent of the sale price.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.256
- Your share will amount to slightly more than $50,000.
- Thank you.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.342
You're to notify all personnel
they will receive two weeks' pay.

08:28.426 --> 08:31.512
- In the meantime
- Wait a minute, this sounds as if we're being closed down.

08:31.596 --> 08:33.890
Who's buying the day? What
difference can it make?

08:33.932 --> 08:36.852
To the 1500 people who work for
you, it makes a lot of difference.

08:36.893 --> 08:39.270
Well, who is buying it?

08:39.313 --> 08:41.940
Or are you ashamed of it?

08:44.275 --> 08:46.404
Lawrence white is the buyer.

08:46.445 --> 08:49.449
White? We're being sold to The Standard.

08:49.532 --> 08:51.910
Oh, I think I'm going to vomit.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.995
So do I.

08:54.079 --> 08:56.206
Mr. White's paper is very successful.

08:56.248 --> 08:58.542
He will undoubtedly make
this one more profitable too.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.919
It won't be this paper anymore.
It'll be lost in The Standard.

09:00.961 --> 09:03.255
As far as we're concerned,
his offer is a generous one.

09:03.339 --> 09:06.926
He's only buying our circulation,
features and goodwill.

09:07.009 --> 09:10.304
He's eliminating his competition,
that's all.

09:10.346 --> 09:13.308
Mrs. Garrison, you've got to stop them.

09:13.349 --> 09:16.853
Your husband created a new kind
of journalism, and you helped him.

09:16.895 --> 09:19.523
Take a look at the first
paper you ever printed.

09:19.606 --> 09:23.277
Here. Page one.
Quote:

09:23.319 --> 09:26.405
"This paper will fight
for progress and reform.

09:26.489 --> 09:28.950
"We'll never be satisfied
merely with printing the news.

09:28.991 --> 09:31.119
"We'll never be afraid
to attack wrong,

09:31.244 --> 09:34.664
Whether by predatory wealth
or predatory poverty."

09:34.748 --> 09:36.792
You're not selling the day,
- you're killing it.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.961
The hearing to approve
the sale will take place...

09:39.044 --> 09:41.130
in surrogates court
day after tomorrow.

09:41.213 --> 09:44.425
- You'll be there, of course.
- I never go to funerals.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.430
I think I like that man.

09:49.514 --> 09:51.808
Too excitable, much.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.103
It might be advisable to replace
him until the sale is consummated.

09:55.186 --> 09:58.815
Oh, shut up.
Please.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.401
Stop it! Stop it!

10:01.527 --> 10:05.823
Come on. Get him, Frank.

10:08.701 --> 10:12.121
Kill him, Frank. Kill him.

10:13.873 --> 10:15.876
Hey, cut it out.

10:20.672 --> 10:23.008
- You all right?
- In the pink.

10:23.092 --> 10:26.470
Yeah. What happened?

10:26.554 --> 10:30.975
One punch, six pushes, two kicks,
lots of hollerin', no decision.

10:31.017 --> 10:33.520
- Henry?
- Well, I was settin' there, minding my own business...

10:33.645 --> 10:37.232
He's been asking for it. Heard the rumor.
Quit without notice. Took a job at the record.

10:37.274 --> 10:40.360
The rumor?
Well, how about it, Mr. Hutcheson?

10:40.444 --> 10:44.657
Is it a rumor? We have a right
to protect ourselves, haven't we?

10:44.698 --> 10:46.742
Well, go ahead.

10:46.826 --> 10:48.786
Tell us we got nothing to worry about.

10:54.751 --> 10:57.087
The day after tomorrow
in surrogates court...

10:59.464 --> 11:01.967
You got two weeks' pay coming
to ya. The paper's closing.

11:02.092 --> 11:04.720
Quit now and look
for another job or...

11:04.762 --> 11:07.181
wait for the probate
judge's decision.

11:07.223 --> 11:09.600
It's up to you.

11:09.684 --> 11:14.105
It was nothing personal, Mr. Hutcheson.
I have my family to think about.

11:14.189 --> 11:16.525
That's right, Henry.
Nothing personal.

11:18.735 --> 11:21.697
- Oh, Mr. Hutcheson, the mayor wants
- I'm busy.

11:23.198 --> 11:25.826
- What are you gonna do?
- I got an assignment.

11:25.868 --> 11:29.705
- Harry?
- There's still a sports page to get out.

11:45.473 --> 11:49.602
- Fighting. A man your age.
- Did me good.

11:49.685 --> 11:52.647
- He was right to quit. They all oughta quit.
- Maybe.

11:52.730 --> 11:55.108
Anyway, I got it out of my system.

11:55.150 --> 11:57.694
You were with the new
york world, weren't you?

11:57.778 --> 12:01.115
Under Pulitzer,
Cobb and Barrett.

12:01.156 --> 12:04.034
- What'd you do when it folded?
- Let's see now.

12:04.076 --> 12:07.747
I think I got myself a drink. Yep,
I'm sure of it.

12:07.830 --> 12:11.793
- Then what'd you do?
- Came over here and went to work for old man Garrison.

12:11.876 --> 12:13.878
He was a great newspaperman.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.674
Yeah, but no good as a father.
Terrible.

12:17.716 --> 12:20.886
Daughters, one of 'em married
to a high-Class broker...

12:20.928 --> 12:23.597
who knows how to invest
their money more wisely.

12:23.639 --> 12:26.642
They hate the paper, same
as they hated the old man.

12:26.726 --> 12:30.563
Couldn't get at him when he was alive, so
now they're kickin' him when he's dead. Yes?

12:30.605 --> 12:34.067
- Five minutes to press time.
- Okay. Come in.

12:34.109 --> 12:37.779
Everybody in this racket gets kicked
sooner or later, dead or alive.

12:37.863 --> 12:40.782
- Get that in the fudge box.
- Yes, sir. Uh, the mayor...

12:40.866 --> 12:44.286
- Darn the mayor!
- Yes, sir.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.999
The mayor.

12:48.207 --> 12:51.711
All he cares about is who'll support
him for reelection if we fold.

12:51.753 --> 12:55.757
By now, the boys will be having a nice
lively wake at O'Brien's. Ever been to one?

12:55.840 --> 12:59.678
Before you know it, lad, you won't be
feeling a thing, not a blessed thing.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.222
That's what a wake is for.

13:14.152 --> 13:17.280
Yes, that's right.

13:17.364 --> 13:21.034
Brothers and sisters,
hush up for a minute.

13:21.118 --> 13:23.245
Friends and unemployed...

13:23.329 --> 13:25.456
Hear, hear. Lend me your ears.

13:25.498 --> 13:28.459
- We're gathered here to bury Caesar.
- No!

13:28.543 --> 13:32.964
Brothers and sisters, we came
to praise the day, not bury it.

13:35.300 --> 13:39.471
- I got the urge, brother! I got the urge!
- Repent and rejoice.

13:39.554 --> 13:42.725
Brother Cleary, a sinner
of 14 years standing,

13:42.766 --> 13:48.356
- Sitting or lying down, will let out the misery.
- Hallelujah!

13:48.397 --> 13:50.692
Maestro, uh, "b" flat,
if you please.

13:50.817 --> 13:54.320
Flash! Scoop-Scoop. Da-Dee-Deep,
Dee-Dee, Dee-Dee, Dee-Dee-Deep. *

13:54.362 --> 13:57.532
I came over the river Jordan
from a weekly scandal sheet...

13:57.616 --> 13:59.868
and asked old John Garrison for a job.

13:59.952 --> 14:02.162
"Are you a journalist
or a reporter?" He said.

14:02.246 --> 14:04.331
"What's the difference?"
I said.

14:04.456 --> 14:06.667
"A journalist makes himself
the hero of the story.

14:06.751 --> 14:11.881
A reporter is only the witness."

14:11.965 --> 14:14.008
Sister Barndollar.

14:14.092 --> 14:18.221
Sister Barndollar, has the spirit
moved the research department?

14:20.432 --> 14:22.810
Ah. The spirits moved her, all right.

14:22.893 --> 14:25.062
Hallelujah and pass
the collection box.

14:25.146 --> 14:27.148
- Sister Willebrandt.
- Cheers.

14:27.189 --> 14:30.943
Comin' through the rye, present
and, uh, half accounted for.

14:30.985 --> 14:33.029
Hey!

14:33.113 --> 14:35.907
Hey, hey, hey! Come on,
honey. Give us a soul talk.

14:35.991 --> 14:38.201
It's a lovely corpse.

14:38.243 --> 14:42.081
Alas, poor dear.
I knew it well.

14:42.122 --> 14:47.295
And why not? I gave it the
best 14 years of my life.

14:47.336 --> 14:49.547
And what have I got
to show for it, huh?

14:49.630 --> 14:54.094
Eighty-One dollars in the
bank, two dead husbands...

14:54.219 --> 14:59.600
and two or three kids I
always wanted but never had.

14:59.683 --> 15:02.227
I've covered everything
from electrocutions...

15:02.311 --> 15:04.396
to love nest brawls.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.526
I've got fallen arches, unfixed teeth,
and you wanna know something, I...

15:08.609 --> 15:12.739
I never saw Paris, but...

15:12.822 --> 15:15.909
But I wouldn't change those years.

15:15.992 --> 15:20.622
Not for anything in this world.

15:22.791 --> 15:26.128
- I see the light, brother.
- Hallelujah!

15:26.212 --> 15:28.631
Purify your soul, sinner.

15:28.714 --> 15:31.426
Save your tears.
This is what the readers want.

15:31.467 --> 15:34.054
- No!
- Throw the atheist out.

15:34.137 --> 15:37.140
Don't sell it short. It's
got twice our circulation...

15:37.224 --> 15:40.102
and three times
our advertising lineage.

15:43.522 --> 15:46.859
It's wild and yellow, but
it's not exactly a newspaper.

15:48.528 --> 15:51.656
- It keeps its people working.
- Hallelujah.

15:51.781 --> 15:55.535
Well, maybe if I'd given you this
kind of paper, you'd still have jobs.

15:55.660 --> 15:58.664
- There's a place for this kind of sheet.
- Where, daddy?

15:58.705 --> 16:00.958
All right, so it's not your kind of paper.

16:00.999 --> 16:03.127
Who are we puttin' out
papers for? You?

16:03.168 --> 16:06.213
You? You?
Huh.

16:06.297 --> 16:08.508
It's not enough anymore
to give 'em just news.

16:08.591 --> 16:11.552
They want comics, contests, puzzles.

16:11.636 --> 16:15.056
They want to know how to bake a cake,
win friends and influence the future.

16:15.098 --> 16:18.143
Ergo, horoscopes, tips on the horses,

16:18.226 --> 16:21.730
Interpretation of dreams so they
can win on the numbers lotteries.

16:21.897 --> 16:26.402
And, if they accidentally
stumble on the first page,

16:26.444 --> 16:28.446
News.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.242
<i>Old man Garrison lies
a moldering in the grave</i>

16:32.283 --> 16:36.413
<i>Old man Garrison lies
a Moldering in the grave</i>

16:36.454 --> 16:39.041
<i>Old man Garrison lies
a moldering in the grave</i>

16:39.082 --> 16:42.211
you know, I never got to Paris either.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.964
Have some anesthetic, brother.

16:45.047 --> 16:57.227
<i>glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

16:57.310 --> 17:02.066
<i>his day is done and gone</i>

17:18.208 --> 17:20.919
Feeling any pain, ed?

17:22.546 --> 17:24.924
Ah, it was a nice wake.

17:24.964 --> 17:26.925
Good night.

17:35.769 --> 17:38.397
Mr. Hutcheson?

17:38.480 --> 17:41.567
I've been trying
to see you all day, sir.

17:41.650 --> 17:44.278
They said I'd find you here and...

17:44.361 --> 17:48.407
This will introduce me, sir. It's from
my journalism professor at the university.

17:48.491 --> 17:52.537
Oh, so you want to be a newspaperman.

17:52.579 --> 17:55.498
Yes, sir. One student a
semester is recommended.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.626
- And you're it.
- Yes, sir.

17:57.667 --> 18:01.004
Newspaperman is the best
profession in the world.

18:01.088 --> 18:03.215
You know what a profession is?

18:03.299 --> 18:08.971
- It's a skilled job.
- Yeah, so's repairing watches. Nope.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.600
A profession is a
performance for public good.

18:12.684 --> 18:15.437
That's why newspaper
work is a profession.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.398
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir."

18:18.565 --> 18:21.652
I-uh, I suppose you want to be a columnist.

18:21.735 --> 18:23.904
Foreign correspondent. To Egypt.

18:24.029 --> 18:26.907
- Do you speak Arabic?
- No, sir, but...

18:26.949 --> 18:29.952
But you do know the
customs, habits, religion,

18:30.036 --> 18:34.708
- Superstitions of the people.
- Well, I took a course in near eastern relations...

18:34.749 --> 18:38.045
You know the psychology of Egyptian
politics and Muslim diplomacy?

18:38.128 --> 18:42.591
- No, sir.
- Expert on economy, topography and geography of Egypt?

18:42.716 --> 18:45.719
I speak a little french.
Maybe I could get a job in the...

18:45.761 --> 18:50.683
Yeah, so do I, but I couldn't hold
down a job in my own Paris office.

18:50.725 --> 18:53.353
I see.

18:55.605 --> 18:57.983
Hey, Joe.

19:01.361 --> 19:04.323
So, you want to be a reporter?

19:04.365 --> 19:07.451
Here's some advice
about this racket.

19:07.493 --> 19:11.080
Don't ever change your mind. It
may not be the oldest profession,

19:11.164 --> 19:13.249
But it's the best.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.377
Yes, sir.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.778
Hi.

19:39.861 --> 19:42.656
Why don't you go home, ed?

19:42.698 --> 19:44.783
Yes'm.

19:51.291 --> 19:56.171
- Guess what?
- Scotch.

19:56.254 --> 20:00.342
I have decided to
dedicate my life to you.

20:00.384 --> 20:02.428
- Yes, dear.
- Yes, dear.

20:04.346 --> 20:07.224
That's why I'm gonna give
you the best years of my life.

20:07.308 --> 20:09.685
Mm-hmm.

20:11.562 --> 20:15.066
Do you know what's the matter with you,
you're a "spektic."

20:15.150 --> 20:17.486
Hmm? Uh, a skeptic.

20:17.611 --> 20:20.531
Yes, dear.

20:20.572 --> 20:22.908
- White beer?
- Homogenized.

20:24.577 --> 20:28.289
Couldn't we spike it
with a little scotch?

20:28.372 --> 20:30.708
Drink that. As is.

20:30.750 --> 20:34.838
Nora, I love you.

20:34.879 --> 20:37.924
Let's get married again.
Tonight.

20:46.684 --> 20:50.813
- This could bring on my second childhood.
- It already has,

20:50.897 --> 20:52.941
Coming here this time of night.

20:56.570 --> 21:00.073
Nora, I'm free.

21:00.115 --> 21:02.701
Fired. Canned.

21:02.785 --> 21:06.580
No more paper. Nothing
to keep us apart anymore.

21:06.622 --> 21:10.877
- The paper has been sold.
- I know.

21:18.760 --> 21:23.390
Divorce is a very evil thing, Nora.

21:23.515 --> 21:29.188
Down from my Olympian
heights, I come... humbly.

21:30.940 --> 21:33.485
I'm gonna make a decent
woman of you again, Nora.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.613
- Yes, dear.
- Yes, dear.

21:38.156 --> 21:40.158
We'll go on a second honeymoon.

21:40.242 --> 21:44.830
- We never had a first.
- No, I'm leveling, baby. There's no more paper.

21:44.997 --> 21:47.041
Travel. That's what we'll do.

21:47.124 --> 21:49.335
Europe, south America, everywhere.

21:49.418 --> 21:51.713
No worry about expense.

21:51.838 --> 21:54.841
- I am loaded.
- So I noticed.

21:54.883 --> 21:59.221
I mean money. More money than
we've ever had in our lives.

21:59.262 --> 22:03.684
- I was paid off for being a good boy.
- Ed.

22:05.811 --> 22:08.105
Listen,

22:08.189 --> 22:10.608
You shouldn't have come here.

22:12.861 --> 22:15.405
It won't work out.

22:17.115 --> 22:18.992
Yeah.

22:29.504 --> 22:34.676
Not bad copy.
Not bad at all.

22:34.801 --> 22:39.264
How is the advertising business?

22:39.306 --> 22:42.184
You know, you were right
to quit the newspaper.

22:42.267 --> 22:45.980
Now, you've got something
you can depend on.

22:46.063 --> 22:49.108
Something legitimate.

22:49.192 --> 22:52.904
I went to a wake tonight.
Saw the light, sister.

22:52.946 --> 22:56.449
Hallelujah.

23:02.039 --> 23:05.793
Why should I fight?
For what?

23:05.876 --> 23:08.296
The publishers don't care
about the paper.

23:08.379 --> 23:10.631
The paper doesn't care about me.

23:10.715 --> 23:14.678
I don't care about anybody except you.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.763
Haven't I met him somewheres before?

23:16.847 --> 23:19.016
Just now, in the living room.

23:19.099 --> 23:22.144
Oh, yeah.
Fight. What with?

23:22.186 --> 23:25.648
I'm an employee, not a stockholder.

23:25.689 --> 23:28.317
Maybe I should have
taken it to the readers.

23:28.401 --> 23:32.488
Ah, what do they care? You
gotta have an issue for that.

23:32.572 --> 23:35.492
Red-hot story.

23:35.533 --> 23:37.577
Nora?

23:37.661 --> 23:40.831
- Right here, darling.
- "Right here, darling."

23:40.914 --> 23:44.460
I don't have to think
about anybody but us.

23:45.461 --> 23:47.505
Yes, dear.

23:47.588 --> 23:51.217
You know, we'll have some great
times together like we used to.

23:51.259 --> 23:54.637
Remember that time in Saranac when
everybody thought we weren't married,

23:54.763 --> 23:58.350
- So we went out and got married?
- For the second time.

23:58.433 --> 24:00.644
And the fishing trips we never went on.

24:00.727 --> 24:03.188
And the hunting trips I promised you.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.524
- We'll make 'em all this time.
- Yes, dear.

24:05.566 --> 24:09.195
How I went up to Reno to
try to stop the divorce.

24:09.237 --> 24:12.365
- What was that you charged me with?
- Incompatibility.

24:12.407 --> 24:16.411
Incompatibility.
Huh, that was a lie.

24:16.494 --> 24:18.497
They know where to reach you?

24:18.538 --> 24:21.083
- Oh, I don't have to account to anybody.
- Yes, dear.

24:24.503 --> 24:26.505
I don't like him.

24:26.589 --> 24:28.674
I'll think of a reason later.

24:28.716 --> 24:30.593
Good night, dear.

25:03.545 --> 25:08.217
City desk. What?

25:08.259 --> 25:10.386
Oh. Hold it.

25:16.351 --> 25:19.479
Okay, go ahead.

25:19.563 --> 25:22.066
When did this happen?

25:22.107 --> 25:24.068
What time is it now?

25:24.109 --> 25:27.238
Six what? 6:20.

25:27.279 --> 25:30.199
Where'd it happen?

25:30.283 --> 25:32.994
Did you call the hospital?

25:33.036 --> 25:35.497
Are they sending an ambulance?

25:35.580 --> 25:37.582
Okay.

25:40.586 --> 25:43.547
- Good morning, darling.
- Ed.

25:43.589 --> 25:46.801
I thought no one knew you were here.

25:46.884 --> 25:49.095
Where else would I go
when I'm in trouble?

25:49.137 --> 25:52.098
- Ed!
- Who slept here?

25:52.140 --> 25:54.184
It's time we had a talk, Ed.

25:54.225 --> 25:56.561
Oh, no, not now, baby.
I'm in a hurry.

25:56.603 --> 25:59.106
- That call was urgent.
- Dinner tonight?

25:59.189 --> 26:01.608
- Why not every night?
- Alberto's place okay?

26:01.692 --> 26:05.654
8:00. I thought you were in a hurry.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.157
Did I have a pleasant time last night?

26:08.241 --> 26:10.535
- Yes, dear.
- I did?

26:10.576 --> 26:12.704
Well, what do you know.

26:23.215 --> 26:26.552
I was making my rounds, sir.
First, I didn't notice anything.

26:26.635 --> 26:29.806
Then I heard a kind of low moaning
coming from the road down there.

26:29.931 --> 26:33.143
Well, good morning.
Automobile accident, eh?

26:33.226 --> 26:35.228
- Get him to the hospital.
- Name?

26:35.270 --> 26:37.355
- I said, get him to the hospital!
- Wait a minute...

26:37.439 --> 26:39.816
My name is Burrows.

26:39.858 --> 26:42.778
I work for the day. He runs it.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.239
Oh. Ben!

26:50.370 --> 26:53.623
They started banging me around
when they got me in the car.

26:53.748 --> 26:55.792
How many were there?

26:55.792 --> 26:57.961
Three, maybe four.

26:58.086 --> 27:00.756
- Well, what was it? Three or four?
- I don't know.

27:00.797 --> 27:04.593
- All right. They gave you a going-over. What with?
- Fists.

27:04.677 --> 27:08.347
One of 'em hit me in the face with
something hard. A sap, I guess.

27:08.389 --> 27:11.392
- What'd they say?
- Nothing. Not after they got me in the car.

27:11.434 --> 27:14.396
- Before?
- Yes. Outside the hall of records. I told you.

27:14.479 --> 27:16.481
- Tell me again.
- Please, sir. He's...

27:16.523 --> 27:18.567
Shut up. The hall of records.

27:18.692 --> 27:21.862
You went there to check on Rienzi.

27:21.904 --> 27:24.031
George.

27:24.073 --> 27:26.867
The man I talked to
must have tipped Rienzi.

27:26.909 --> 27:30.913
- Yeah? How do you know?
- He left the office for a few minutes. Probably phoned.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.166
- Probably? But you're not positive.
- No.

27:33.249 --> 27:37.587
- That won't stand up in court.
- How else were they waiting for me when I came out?

27:37.671 --> 27:40.299
- Who was waiting?
- Rienzi's men.

27:40.340 --> 27:45.429
- Can you identify them?
- One,maybe. A former boxer,Torpedo.

27:45.471 --> 27:50.476
- Know his name?
- Whitey. I'm not sure. Whitey something.

27:50.601 --> 27:52.937
If I brought him in,
could you identify him?

27:52.979 --> 27:55.941
He asked me if I was Burrows.
He asked me if I worked for the day.

27:56.024 --> 27:57.859
- What make car was it?
- I don't know.

27:58.068 --> 28:01.071
- Sedan? Blue? Black? What?
- What are you trying to do, protect Rienzi?

28:01.113 --> 28:03.073
I want facts that won't bounce.

28:03.157 --> 28:06.202
Facts that'll stand up against
Rienzi's lawyers and libel suits.

28:06.243 --> 28:09.080
Facts that'll tear Rienzi's
syndicate wide open.

28:09.163 --> 28:13.126
There just can't be any mistake.
We can't have any retractions.

28:15.045 --> 28:17.005
George.

28:31.562 --> 28:34.691
- How's it look?
- I'm afraid he may lose that eye.

28:36.568 --> 28:38.945
Mrs. Burrows.

28:39.029 --> 28:41.782
Go away, Mr. Hutcheson.
Let us alone.

28:41.865 --> 28:43.784
Are you blaming me?

28:43.867 --> 28:46.704
Who sent him out?
And for what?

28:46.746 --> 28:49.582
The great big, fat glory
of a newspaper?

28:49.665 --> 28:51.876
A paper you haven't
even got anymore.

28:56.131 --> 28:58.884
Mr. Allen? One moment, please.
The day, good morning.

28:58.967 --> 29:01.512
Put every man you can
spare on the Rienzi story.

29:01.595 --> 29:03.722
- Picture layout?
- The works, where he gets his money,

29:03.806 --> 29:06.392
His tie-ups, data, facts,
facts and more facts.

29:06.475 --> 29:09.270
- The tough thing is to prove them, Ed.
- Prove them later.

29:10.354 --> 29:12.357
- Charlie.
- Boy.

29:12.398 --> 29:15.902
Uh, city morgue?
This is Willebrandt of the day.

29:16.027 --> 29:19.156
Any identification yet on
that nude in the fur coat?

29:19.239 --> 29:23.077
Miss Barndollar. Relax.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.120
- Ever heard of Rienzi?
- Mm-hmm.

29:25.162 --> 29:28.124
Okay, now. Rienzi, Tomas. Fifty-One.

29:28.165 --> 29:31.586
Born, Palermo, Sicily.
Emigrated here, 1914.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.671
Attended public school number 47.

29:33.755 --> 29:35.757
Has two children
by legal wife Gertrude.

29:35.799 --> 29:37.926
We're not proposing him
for the chamber of commerce.

29:37.968 --> 29:40.262
We want to convict him of
every known crime in the books,

29:40.304 --> 29:42.890
All of which he's committed and some
even you, even I, never heard of.

29:42.973 --> 29:45.100
- I want everything.
- Yes, sir.

29:45.184 --> 29:48.271
I must've taken 20 shots of her as
they were dragging her out of the river.

29:48.312 --> 29:51.065
- That fur coat's worth $5000 or $6000
- Tim, get your camera.

29:51.149 --> 29:54.235
- Cover Burrows in the city hospital.
- George? Our George?

29:54.319 --> 29:57.697
That's right. You take Rienzi,
his wife, home, cars, everything.

29:57.781 --> 30:00.075
What if he smashes the
camera? He's done it before.

30:00.158 --> 30:02.870
Let him.
You get pictures of him doin' it.

30:02.995 --> 30:05.748
Go ahead.

30:05.831 --> 30:09.168
Bill, Bill, I want a cartoon on Rienzi.

30:09.210 --> 30:11.421
It's gotta be hard,
tough, below the belt.

30:11.504 --> 30:15.425
A vulture sucking the life
out of a city. You got it?

30:15.467 --> 30:19.262
But a vulture only preys
on the dead or the dying.

30:19.346 --> 30:21.348
Preys.

30:21.431 --> 30:24.476
"Let us prey." P-R-E-Y.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.604
The paper, the paper. Why
should I stick my neck out?

30:26.729 --> 30:29.023
I want it for the first edition.

30:29.106 --> 30:33.194
I don't like the idea. I get in a jam with
Rienzi and tomorrow the paper folds anyway.

30:33.278 --> 30:35.572
- Where does that leave me?
- You're fired.

30:35.655 --> 30:37.866
- Wait a minute
- Pay him off and get him out of here.

30:37.949 --> 30:40.994
- Why the excitement? Everybody knows we're washed up. - That's your mistake.

30:41.078 --> 30:43.288
- But I worked here four years.
- That's my mistake.

30:43.414 --> 30:45.458
Boy.

30:45.541 --> 30:47.418
City desk.
Get your voucher.

30:49.212 --> 30:51.297
Miss Bentley, get your
stenotype in there.

30:51.422 --> 30:53.466
Get Dr. Emmanuel on the phone.

30:53.508 --> 30:57.679
Draw $500 out of my bank and
get it over to Burrows's wife.

30:57.721 --> 30:59.640
Mr. Bellamy here's been waiting.

30:59.681 --> 31:01.809
Oh, yeah.

31:01.850 --> 31:05.646
- Rewrite desk. Lobster shift.
- What's the lobster shift?

31:05.729 --> 31:07.857
After midnight we serve lobsters.

31:07.982 --> 31:10.151
Thermidor, naturally.

31:10.234 --> 31:12.862
Uh...

31:12.946 --> 31:16.867
Page one editorial.
Ten point type. Double column.

31:16.950 --> 31:19.077
Byline,

31:19.119 --> 31:21.789
Set off in boldface will be:

31:23.666 --> 31:26.419
John Garrison.

31:26.460 --> 31:30.047
Quote:

31:30.173 --> 31:33.426
"I am dead.

31:33.468 --> 31:36.179
"I've been dead for 11 years.

31:36.221 --> 31:40.058
"By tomorrow, this newspaper
may also be dead.

31:40.142 --> 31:44.313
"But as long as it lives, the day
will continue to report the facts...

31:44.396 --> 31:48.693
"and the meaning of
those facts without fear,

31:48.776 --> 31:52.530
"Without distortion, without
hope of personal gain...

31:52.614 --> 31:55.241
as it always has done."

31:56.785 --> 31:59.162
- Yes?
- Dr. Emmanuel on two.

32:01.457 --> 32:05.461
Hello, doctor.
No, no, no. I'm fine.

32:05.544 --> 32:08.798
Yeah, uh, I want to ask you a favor.

32:08.840 --> 32:13.386
A personal friend of mine needs
your help. He's in the city hospital.

32:13.511 --> 32:17.432
Name is Burrows, George Burrows.
What?

32:19.309 --> 32:21.436
What is more important, doctor,

32:21.478 --> 32:25.316
Your delivering a lecture in
London or saving a man's eyesight?

32:25.399 --> 32:27.610
Well, cancel it.

32:27.818 --> 32:29.987
Well, then delay it.

32:30.071 --> 32:32.615
We weren't too busy to
raise funds for your clinic.

32:32.699 --> 32:34.909
Well, certainly I'm putting
it on a personal basis.

32:34.993 --> 32:37.913
What's a friend for, if not for a favor?

32:37.954 --> 32:40.374
Thank you.

32:40.457 --> 32:42.960
A real humanitarian.

32:44.378 --> 32:48.382
Oh. Where was I?

32:48.507 --> 32:51.427
"Will continue to report the facts
and the meaning of those facts"

32:51.511 --> 32:53.596
Oh, that sentence is too long.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.224
Break it down. Change
the word "distortion."

32:56.349 --> 32:59.770
Somebody mightn't know
what it means. Okay?

32:59.811 --> 33:02.815
Paragraph. Quote:

33:02.898 --> 33:05.651
"What are the facts?

33:05.734 --> 33:07.820
Rienzi stuffs your ballot boxes."

33:39.479 --> 33:42.357
If anything will save the paper,
this is it.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.496
You see the paper yet?

33:54.537 --> 33:57.624
- Who's responsible?
- Obviously Hutcheson.

33:57.666 --> 33:59.918
- Hutcheson?
- Afraid so.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.464
Well, talk to him.

34:03.589 --> 34:07.635
Why can't you?

34:07.677 --> 34:12.014
I wanna meet him personally.

34:12.098 --> 34:16.686
Why not?

34:16.728 --> 34:20.357
Everybody can be reached.
Remember, judge?

34:20.440 --> 34:22.484
Evening, Mr. White.

34:22.568 --> 34:24.527
Evening, Mr. White.
Mr. White.

34:24.570 --> 34:27.031
Give me a three column lead
with two line bank on that raid.

34:27.072 --> 34:30.159
- Evening, Mr. White.
- Did you see this spread on Rienzi in the day?

34:30.243 --> 34:32.370
Yes, sir. What have you
done about it for our paper?

34:32.453 --> 34:34.621
Done, sir? A reporter
gets into a barroom brawl?

34:34.706 --> 34:37.042
- They say it was Rienzi.
- But can they prove it?

34:37.125 --> 34:39.710
- Prove it?
- Front page editorials, flashy cartoons...

34:39.753 --> 34:41.755
Why, it's old-Fashioned, Mr. White.

34:41.839 --> 34:45.342
And what's so ultramodern
about this horse in our paper?

34:45.426 --> 34:48.721
Then give me some old-Fashioned
journalism in The Standard.

34:48.929 --> 34:51.139
Yes, sir.

34:51.224 --> 34:53.141
Get me the city hospital.

34:56.187 --> 34:58.273
Sorry I'm late.

34:58.315 --> 35:01.360
- You like it?
- It's the best looking front page in town.

35:01.401 --> 35:03.404
- As usual.
- The makeup...

35:03.529 --> 35:06.490
- Thank you.
- The cartoon, the editorial under the name of Garrison.

35:06.532 --> 35:08.576
- Yours?
- Mm-hmm.

35:08.659 --> 35:10.703
- It's wonderful.
- As usual.

35:10.787 --> 35:13.081
And how are we?
Are we as usual?

35:13.206 --> 35:15.417
Maybe the heirs will
sit up and take notice.

35:15.458 --> 35:18.628
- Of us?
- They won't sell the paper. Not now.

35:18.670 --> 35:21.799
Not in the middle of a fight like this.
It would be like endorsing Rienzi.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.134
It's a wonderful dress for dinner.

35:24.218 --> 35:26.262
You look much better
than you did last night.

35:26.345 --> 35:28.306
- How do you feel?
- Amorous.

35:28.389 --> 35:30.391
- Good evening, Mrs. Hutcheson.
- Evening.

35:30.516 --> 35:32.977
Mr. Hutcheson. Your table's
ready, sir. Will you order now?

35:33.061 --> 35:36.773
- An appetizer first perhaps?
- Oh, no, thank you. I have mine.

35:36.815 --> 35:40.110
- Oh, just steak for me.
- Telephone, Mr. Hutcheson.

35:40.235 --> 35:43.739
- Tell 'em I'm feeding.
- They said it's important.

35:43.781 --> 35:46.784
Urgent, dear. As usual.

35:50.538 --> 35:54.000
- Keep calling her Mrs. Hutcheson.
- Yes, sir.

35:54.167 --> 35:55.919
Uh, Mrs. Hutcheson.

35:59.464 --> 36:02.885
- Yes?
- This is Willebrandt. I'm at the city morgue.

36:02.926 --> 36:05.179
The place where little girls
check their fur coats.

36:05.262 --> 36:08.516
The dead nude? What about her?

36:08.599 --> 36:11.227
Well, her mother showed up to
identify her this afternoon.

36:11.269 --> 36:13.271
Is a Mrs. Schmidt.

36:13.396 --> 36:15.774
That's the girl's name,
Bessie Schmidt.

36:15.815 --> 36:19.403
But she also used
the name Sally Gardiner.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.572
Why bother me? Write it.

36:21.655 --> 36:23.782
Well, what I wanted to know is this.

36:23.866 --> 36:28.913
Now, Allen thought I ought to
check with you first, but uh,

36:29.038 --> 36:33.168
This Mrs. Schmidt knows a
lot more than she's telling.

36:34.335 --> 36:36.338
No.

36:36.379 --> 36:39.466
No, but I thought maybe if you
talked to her, you could get...

36:39.508 --> 36:41.468
Let's not be dramatic, Mrs. Willebrandt.

36:41.510 --> 36:43.887
No, no, no, I can't. You handle it.

36:56.443 --> 36:59.279
Her name's Fifi. She made a
pass at me in the cloakroom.

36:59.363 --> 37:02.282
It's a way I have with women.

37:03.742 --> 37:06.787
I'm getting married again, Ed.

37:10.792 --> 37:14.129
That's right. I'm giving
it to you straight and fast.

37:14.212 --> 37:18.633
You don't know the man. He-he's
my boss at the advertising agency.

37:20.010 --> 37:22.096
First me, now another boss.

37:22.179 --> 37:24.223
It's getting to be a habit with you,
isn't it?

37:24.306 --> 37:26.642
- I'd like you to meet him.
- Compare notes, you mean?

37:26.726 --> 37:28.853
Thanks, I know enough people already.

37:28.895 --> 37:31.856
- His name is Lewis Shafer.
- I don't want to know anything about him.

37:31.940 --> 37:34.984
- I told him all about you.
- Everything?

37:35.068 --> 37:37.112
Sit down.

37:37.153 --> 37:39.364
I'm not one of your modern husbands,

37:39.448 --> 37:41.950
Chin up, stiff upper lip
and all that sort of stuff,

37:42.159 --> 37:43.994
Always ready to discuss things sensibly.

37:44.036 --> 37:47.206
There isn't anything to discuss.
I don't need your consent.

37:47.289 --> 37:50.168
- We're divorced. Have been for two years
- I don't recognize the divorce.

37:50.251 --> 37:52.629
- You agreed to it.
- I was wrong.

37:52.670 --> 37:56.591
You're my wife. Not only because
somebody said a few words over us,

37:56.675 --> 37:59.344
But because of all we meant
to each other for eight years.

37:59.428 --> 38:02.473
You can't change all that with
more words, legal or otherwise.

38:02.556 --> 38:05.851
- They want you on the telephone, Mr. Hutcheson.
- Go away.

38:05.935 --> 38:09.021
You want me to quit the paper, okay.
I'll get another job, something..

38:09.230 --> 38:12.317
- I don't want you to quit.
- I had to go back today. Tomorrow, it's over.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.820
It's right that you should go
back. It's where you belong.

38:15.904 --> 38:19.241
You're the best newspaperman in the world.

38:19.282 --> 38:21.785
I don't want to change
that. I never did.

38:21.994 --> 38:25.498
It's your whole life, and for you,
it's right.

38:25.539 --> 38:29.877
But I've got a right to a life too,
and you can't give it to me.

38:30.002 --> 38:34.090
- Can he?
- Maybe.

38:34.174 --> 38:38.929
Can you be the same with him as
you were with me? Is it that easy?

38:40.889 --> 38:44.476
Do you love him?

38:44.518 --> 38:47.813
No, you don't.
Not the same way.

38:47.855 --> 38:51.275
Maybe love isn't enough
to make a marriage work.

38:51.401 --> 38:53.820
Please, Mr. Hutcheson.

38:53.903 --> 38:57.115
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but it's your office.

38:57.199 --> 39:02.371
Mr. Allen. He said if you won't come to
the phone than to come back to the paper.

39:02.454 --> 39:04.415
I'm sorry, sir.

39:19.932 --> 39:21.892
Yes?

39:23.102 --> 39:26.147
What? Yanked what story?

39:26.230 --> 39:30.526
Willebrandt's story on Sally Gardiner.

39:30.610 --> 39:34.280
Well, it was pulled by our
advertising department.

39:34.364 --> 39:38.785
It seems Mr. Andrew Wharton, president
of Wharton's department store,

39:38.827 --> 39:40.829
Was Sally's caviar ticket.

39:42.414 --> 39:46.252
Right. Right.

39:46.293 --> 39:49.881
Composing room. One column head
one bank on this weather report.

39:49.964 --> 39:52.008
- Yes?
- Jake?

39:52.091 --> 39:54.344
On Willebrandt's story, Sally Gardiner?

39:54.427 --> 39:57.639
Yeah. Hold it, but don't kill it.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.155
You worry about every story
in our paper, Mr. Fenway?

40:12.238 --> 40:14.407
It just seemed to me
this was libelous material.

40:14.532 --> 40:17.369
- We got a hundred stories in this
issue. Check 'em all for libel?
- No, sir.

40:17.452 --> 40:19.621
- Or any of them?
- No, sir.

40:19.705 --> 40:23.167
I see. You're a self-appointed censor
only on stories involving big advertisers.

40:23.208 --> 40:26.128
- I was trying to protect us.
- Us or you or Mr. Wharton, and for how much?

40:26.170 --> 40:28.589
- He denies this story.
- Willebrandt included his denial.

40:28.673 --> 40:30.717
From there on, it's up to the police.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.011
- I thought as a matter of policy
- Policy?

40:33.094 --> 40:36.973
Since when has the advertising department
of this paper dictated its policy on news?

40:37.015 --> 40:41.436
- I didn't act on my own.
- No. You haven't got the guts, so you went to Wharton.

40:41.478 --> 40:43.564
- Run the story.
- I talked to Alice Garrison.

40:43.647 --> 40:46.150
Mr. Wharton came here. We phoned
her. It was on her authority.

40:46.233 --> 40:49.237
She hasn't got the authority,
not until I'm out of here.

40:49.278 --> 40:52.198
Or have you arranged
for that too? No, sir.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.200
You're slipping.

40:54.242 --> 40:57.412
Well, you talk to Mr. Wharton.
He's waiting right in here.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.582
Mr. Wharton.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.168
- This is Mr. Hutcheson.
- How do you do, sir?

41:05.421 --> 41:08.674
- May I give you my side of it?
- I'll take care of this.

41:12.220 --> 41:14.681
- Please don't publish that story.
- Why? Isn't it true?

41:14.723 --> 41:18.602
It can't do you much good, and
it'll ruin me and hurt my family.

41:18.685 --> 41:21.396
I've been doing business
with your paper for 20 years.

41:22.773 --> 41:24.817
You're a big advertiser, Mr. Wharton.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.236
- We need your business, but not on those terms.
- All right.

41:27.278 --> 41:30.448
I made a mistake with Sally,
but that was 10 years ago,

41:30.490 --> 41:32.867
And I've paid for it
in blackmail every month.

41:32.951 --> 41:35.495
I'm sorry, Mr. Wharton.
This is a matter for the police.

41:35.578 --> 41:38.039
You are interested in facts,
aren't you?

41:40.292 --> 41:42.252
One day, Sally phoned.

41:42.294 --> 41:46.424
She was quitting her job at the store.
She was letting me off the hook.

41:46.507 --> 41:48.509
She said there was another man.

41:48.593 --> 41:52.847
- Another man? There always is.
- In this case, the man was Tomas Rienzi.

41:52.931 --> 41:56.101
Sally said she loved him,
would never bother me again.

41:56.142 --> 42:01.023
She even sent back some...
damaging photographs... of us.

42:01.064 --> 42:03.067
She said she was set for life.

42:03.150 --> 42:05.486
- What did she mean by that?
- She didn't say.

42:07.363 --> 42:09.323
Surely you don't think I killed Sally.

42:09.365 --> 42:11.367
I haven't seen her in over two years.

42:11.492 --> 42:14.370
Mrs. Wharton knew about Sally.
She suggested that I talk to you.

42:14.454 --> 42:17.290
Your paper forced me to come
here, but now that I'm here,

42:17.332 --> 42:19.376
I don't know...

42:19.459 --> 42:25.341
- Wharton, you can tell your wife I'm holding the story.
- Thank you, sir.

42:25.424 --> 42:28.094
- But if that yarn about Rienzi doesn't jell
- It will.

42:28.177 --> 42:30.054
It better, for both our sakes.

42:31.639 --> 42:34.350
- Jim?
- Uh, later, dear.

42:34.434 --> 42:36.436
What have you got on Sally Gardiner?

42:36.478 --> 42:38.605
- The furry blonde?
- Uh-huh.

42:38.647 --> 42:41.108
- She was a broad.
- Yes, but whose?

42:41.275 --> 42:45.154
- Since when do you go in for gossip?
- Since now.

42:48.741 --> 42:52.745
Jim, was Rienzi playin' around with Sally?

42:52.787 --> 42:56.249
- What do you want?
- Proof. I wanna be sure.

42:56.333 --> 42:59.086
From this, a fella could catch a
hole in the head.

42:59.169 --> 43:01.505
Yeah, he could. That bother you?

43:01.547 --> 43:04.383
Oh, no. No, no, no.

43:13.726 --> 43:15.687
Harry?

43:16.938 --> 43:19.066
Ever hear of Herman Schmidt?

43:19.149 --> 43:21.860
Small-Time stuff. Had some kind
of a political job at the arena.

43:21.944 --> 43:24.029
Boxing judge, I think.

43:24.071 --> 43:27.742
- Oh, yeah. I got him now.
- Brother of Sally Gardiner.

43:27.825 --> 43:30.161
Sally may have been tied in with Rienzi.

43:30.244 --> 43:33.581
I know one thing. Rienzi's tied
in with the boxing commission.

43:35.166 --> 43:39.379
Yeah. Get a hold of Schmidt.
Sweat him.

43:39.421 --> 43:41.840
- 'Bout his job?
- About Sally.

43:41.965 --> 43:43.968
- Boy!
- Here's Willebrandt's copy.

43:44.051 --> 43:47.513
All we've got on Sally is
she was once a bathing beauty.

43:47.555 --> 43:50.266
One thing you're short on is time.

43:50.349 --> 43:52.477
Sally and her brother were born here.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.605
Her mother came from Germany.
Father dead.

43:55.689 --> 43:58.859
No known criminal record for Sally.
No recorded marriages.

43:58.942 --> 44:01.945
Yes?

44:02.029 --> 44:04.823
A Mr. Lewis Shafer to see you.

44:07.410 --> 44:09.370
Okay.

44:11.914 --> 44:13.917
- Barndollar?
- Yes, sir?

44:14.000 --> 44:18.171
Relax. If Luggerman's closed the
financial page, ask him to come in.

44:18.213 --> 44:20.090
Yes, sir.

44:27.431 --> 44:29.475
- Happy to meet you, Mr...
- Yeah.

44:29.559 --> 44:31.769
- Got those pictures?
- Uh, right here.

44:31.811 --> 44:33.771
Put 'em up here, chronologically.

44:33.855 --> 44:35.940
- Sit down, Mr. Shafer.
- Thank you, but what I...

44:36.024 --> 44:38.860
Leave a space for the missing
period between Wharton and Rienzi.

44:38.944 --> 44:40.988
Yes, sir.

44:41.071 --> 44:43.073
- Coffee, Mr. Shafer? Sandwich?
- No, thanks.

44:43.157 --> 44:45.493
I didn't mean to interrupt your work.

44:45.534 --> 44:48.371
- How's my wife?
- That's what I came to see you about.

44:48.454 --> 44:50.581
- Shoot.
- Well...

44:50.665 --> 44:53.293
- Nora ask you to come?
- Well, of course not.

44:53.418 --> 44:55.670
I thought that we could...

44:55.712 --> 44:57.714
Well, this is rather personal,
Mr. Hutcheson.

44:57.798 --> 45:02.219
In as much as it concerns my wife,
I hope it's not too personal.

45:02.261 --> 45:04.722
- You're making her very unhappy...
- Want me?

45:04.805 --> 45:09.352
Oh, Luggerman. I want a report on all
Rienzi's investments, legit and otherwise...

45:09.393 --> 45:12.605
Dummy corporations, everything. Real
estate, manufacturing, investments...

45:12.647 --> 45:14.691
- Whatever you can dig up.
- You got a starting point?

45:14.774 --> 45:18.153
Try the tax reports. Charlie in the
governor's office might give you a hand.

45:18.236 --> 45:20.238
- Right.
- Make it thorough.

45:23.117 --> 45:26.954
So I'm, uh, making her unhappy,
Mr. Shafer?

45:26.996 --> 45:29.791
Let her alone. You're confusing her,
making her feel guilty.

45:29.832 --> 45:31.876
Her responsibility to you is over.

45:31.918 --> 45:35.046
- Well, then why are you here?
- I'm only trying to do what's best for Nora.

45:35.088 --> 45:38.425
Well, that's not only ridiculous, but
insulting. You're not that much of a prize.

45:38.508 --> 45:40.677
Ed, here's the... Oh, excuse me.

45:40.719 --> 45:43.722
What have you got?

45:43.806 --> 45:45.808
- Sally bought some government bonds.
- When?

45:45.891 --> 45:47.893
- Five months ago.
- Sally or Rienzi?

45:47.977 --> 45:50.521
In her name. 40,000 worth. And
it took some doing at this hour,

45:50.730 --> 45:53.274
But we've got a checkup working
in every bank for saving accounts.

45:53.358 --> 45:55.360
- Safety deposit boxes?
- That too.

45:55.443 --> 45:57.404
That's all we've got.
Okay.

45:57.487 --> 45:59.531
Look here, Frank.

45:59.614 --> 46:02.534
Sally as a high school girl, model
for Wharton's department store,

46:02.659 --> 46:06.664
Showgirl, kept girl,
missing portion, the river.

46:06.705 --> 46:10.126
Now if we can plug up this hole between
Wharton's department store and the river,

46:10.168 --> 46:12.587
Fill it up with Rienzi...

46:12.670 --> 46:15.674
Goodbye, Mr. Shafer.
I can't wish you good luck.

46:15.757 --> 46:18.635
- You know how it is.
- There's something you ought to know, Mr. Hutcheson.

46:18.719 --> 46:21.555
- Yes?
- Jim Cleary on one.

46:21.597 --> 46:24.892
- Yes, Jim?
- Nora and I are getting married tomorrow night.

46:24.934 --> 46:27.687
Ed? Ed!

46:27.770 --> 46:32.108
I thought it best not to delay
any longer. You know how it is.

46:34.110 --> 46:36.696
- Ed?
- Yes, yes. Go ahead.

46:36.738 --> 46:39.574
Here it is, just what
you've been looking for.

46:39.658 --> 46:42.327
Yeah. Rienzi's your boy, all right.

46:42.411 --> 46:44.580
Showgirl in a musical
produced by Al Murray.

46:44.663 --> 46:48.376
The show was backed by Rienzi
over three years ago. Frank.

46:48.417 --> 46:52.797
Oh, it's the only show Rienzi
backed. He insisted Sally be in it.

46:52.839 --> 46:55.592
I'm with Al Murray now.

46:55.675 --> 46:59.680
He says that Rienzi used to send a car
around for her every night after the show.

46:59.721 --> 47:01.765
- Hold it.
- Yep.

47:01.807 --> 47:05.144
- Switch this call to rewrite. You hear that, Cleary?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

47:05.186 --> 47:07.521
Oh, Frank.

47:07.605 --> 47:10.399
On the Willebrandt story, uh,
kill the part about Wharton.

47:10.483 --> 47:12.610
Use Cleary's story for a lead-all.

47:12.652 --> 47:15.196
Throw in Sally's face.
No nudity.

47:21.286 --> 47:23.956
- Miss Barndollar?
- Yes, sir?

47:23.998 --> 47:26.083
I want a complete check
on Lewis Shafer,

47:26.125 --> 47:28.961
Runs the united advertising agency.

47:29.045 --> 47:32.006
- Shafer.
- Yes, sir.

47:32.090 --> 47:34.592
- Yes, sir?
- Anything from Thompson yet?

47:34.634 --> 47:36.678
No, sir.

47:48.691 --> 47:51.444
Mr. Schmidt?

47:56.366 --> 47:59.202
Mr. Schmidt?

48:04.959 --> 48:06.961
- Don't move.
- I just wanna...

48:07.002 --> 48:09.046
Shut up!

48:13.301 --> 48:15.261
Take your hat off.

48:18.974 --> 48:21.768
Sit down. No, over there.

48:25.523 --> 48:27.316
Put your hands on the table.

48:32.155 --> 48:34.699
Relax, Herman.
I'm here to help you.

48:34.741 --> 48:37.118
- Who's with you?
- Nobody.

48:38.954 --> 48:41.039
What's the pitch?

48:41.123 --> 48:44.209
My name is Thompson.
Reporter, sports, for the day...

48:44.251 --> 48:46.337
Don't do that!

48:48.381 --> 48:50.550
Sports, huh?

48:52.510 --> 48:54.387
What'd you write today?

49:00.227 --> 49:03.981
"The question of televising
next season's baseball games...

49:04.064 --> 49:07.985
was discussed at a heated session
of the hot stove league yesterday".

49:13.241 --> 49:15.326
What do you want?

49:15.410 --> 49:17.496
Do you mind putting that thing away?

49:17.579 --> 49:19.623
How did you find me?

49:19.665 --> 49:21.917
You know a lot of people
in the fight game.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.670
They owe me favors.
I collected a few.

49:24.712 --> 49:27.465
All right. Get to it.

49:31.427 --> 49:34.264
Why did Rienzi... kill your sister?

49:35.807 --> 49:37.726
Did he?

49:39.394 --> 49:43.691
Then who you afraid of, Herman?
Why the hideout?

49:43.732 --> 49:45.818
That won't get you anywhere.

49:45.901 --> 49:50.072
I phoned your address in to
the paper. They know I'm here.

49:50.156 --> 49:52.784
By the next edition,
Rienzi'll know where you are.

49:57.664 --> 50:00.125
We're your only chance, Herman.

50:00.208 --> 50:02.377
Let me take you to the paper
and you'll be safe.

50:04.630 --> 50:06.715
Sooner or later,
Rienzi'll get to you,

50:06.799 --> 50:08.843
And you'll wind up
in the morgue beside Sally.

50:12.597 --> 50:15.767
As long as Rienzi is free,
you're a dead pigeon.

50:19.354 --> 50:21.815
Take your time.

50:21.899 --> 50:25.528
Rienzi won't get his copy of the
day with your address until morning.

50:41.628 --> 50:44.715
I have carefully read
the last will and testament...

50:44.798 --> 50:46.550
of the deceased, John Garrison.

50:46.675 --> 50:49.470
I find nothing therein
to prevent the sale...

50:49.554 --> 50:52.307
of the publication enterprises
known as the day.

50:52.348 --> 50:55.769
Your honor, Mrs. Garrison, wife of
the deceased and one of the heirs,

50:55.852 --> 50:59.856
- Would like to address the court.
- Mrs. Garrison?

50:59.940 --> 51:03.736
Sir, I object to the sale
of this paper to Mr. White.

51:03.819 --> 51:06.280
Your honor, Mrs. Garrison has agreed...

51:06.322 --> 51:10.118
But this request for sale was
signed by you, Mrs. Garrison.

51:10.201 --> 51:12.287
I've changed my mind.

51:12.328 --> 51:15.165
Mrs. Garrison's daughters have
not, and they constitute a majority.

51:15.248 --> 51:18.168
My husband would not have wished for
this paper to be sold to Mr. White.

51:18.293 --> 51:21.296
- How do you know?
- Your honor, I object to cross-Examination...

51:21.380 --> 51:23.590
until the witness has
completed her statement.

51:23.632 --> 51:26.385
You knew the paper was
being sold to Mr. White.

51:26.385 --> 51:29.388
But I did not know it was going
to be rubbed out of existence,

51:29.472 --> 51:32.850
Which it will be if
this contract is approved.

51:32.892 --> 51:36.646
What happens to this newspaper after it has
been sold is of absolutely no concern here.

51:36.730 --> 51:38.774
Is Mr. Crane the lawyer and the judge?

51:38.857 --> 51:41.985
This is a cheap display of
sensationalism and conspiracy.

51:42.069 --> 51:45.865
- Would the other heirs care to reconsider?
- No, sir.

51:45.948 --> 51:48.284
Would it be all right, Mr. Crane,

51:48.326 --> 51:50.620
If they answered for themselves?

51:53.456 --> 51:57.210
Mrs. Alice Garrison Courtney.

51:57.294 --> 52:00.672
- Do you still wish to sell?
- Yes, sir.

52:00.756 --> 52:05.135
Mrs. Katherine Garrison Geary.

52:05.219 --> 52:07.805
Yes, sir.

52:09.432 --> 52:12.602
In that case, the paper may be sold.

52:12.685 --> 52:15.188
- Then I'll buy it.
- A contract already exists.

52:15.230 --> 52:17.774
But, your honor, Mrs. Garrison
has priority of purchase.

52:17.983 --> 52:21.570
- I'll raise Mr. White's offer.
- Your honor, I cannot see that my client's interests...

52:21.612 --> 52:24.573
I don't see why you should object
to my daughters receiving more money.

52:24.657 --> 52:26.700
That's what they're selling
out for, isn't it? Money?

52:26.784 --> 52:28.703
Will the counsel kindly step up here?

52:32.498 --> 52:36.002
- You can't do this.
- I can, I want to, and I'm going to.

52:36.169 --> 52:38.046
What good will it do?

52:38.130 --> 52:40.799
You'll be happy to know that
stupidity is not hereditary.

52:40.883 --> 52:42.926
You've acquired it all by yourselves.

52:42.968 --> 52:45.179
You're making us sound like fools.

52:45.221 --> 52:48.099
- Well...
- What changed your mind?

52:48.140 --> 52:51.185
Have you seen today's paper,
and yesterday's?

52:51.269 --> 52:56.775
Loyalty changed my mind, a principle
evidently lacking in the present generation.

52:56.816 --> 52:58.902
You haven't got the money
to buy the paper.

52:58.985 --> 53:02.072
- I'll get it.
- You're crazy.

53:02.156 --> 53:07.370
No, just ashamed. Ashamed for
me, for you and for your father.

53:07.411 --> 53:10.456
I'm not going to let this paper die.

53:10.498 --> 53:14.461
If that makes me crazy,
I'm good and crazy.

53:14.544 --> 53:16.504
All right?

53:18.548 --> 53:24.013
I should have required time to
consider Mrs. Garrison's request.

53:24.054 --> 53:27.183
Counsel will be notified
when this court will reconvene.

53:27.224 --> 53:29.477
- Sir?
- Mr. White?

53:29.560 --> 53:33.314
Any delay, even 24 hours,
will wreck the value of the day.

53:33.398 --> 53:37.611
People will not buy a dying
paper nor advertise in it.

53:37.694 --> 53:40.572
Now the staff of the day
will become demoralized.

53:40.656 --> 53:43.617
No newspaper can function
under this handicap.

53:43.659 --> 53:45.995
Thank you, Mr. White.

53:46.078 --> 53:50.208
However, I must preserve decision.

53:50.291 --> 53:55.463
But... if the current high standard
of journalism in the day slackens,

53:55.505 --> 54:00.010
Or any act of neglect threatens
the well-Being of this newspaper,

54:00.052 --> 54:03.263
I shall be forced to make an
immediate decision...

54:03.305 --> 54:05.474
based upon the current contract.

54:11.522 --> 54:13.858
- Mr. Hutcheson? My name is Hansen.
- Yes?

54:13.900 --> 54:17.779
I'm, uh, Mr. Rienzi's lawyer.
He's waiting to see you in his car.

54:17.946 --> 54:19.823
- Why?
- It's personal business.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.952
- A ride?
- No, sir. A drive.

54:31.335 --> 54:33.254
How do you do, Mr. Hutcheson?

54:39.386 --> 54:42.765
- I give you a lift someplace?
- Why?

54:42.848 --> 54:46.727
- I'm a sociable type.
- They're expecting me at my office.

54:48.229 --> 54:51.357
- Okay, lippy.
- Okay, what?

54:51.441 --> 54:55.612
- Just okay.
- I wondered when and how you'd get around to this.

54:55.653 --> 54:59.157
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I expected something a little more poetic.

55:00.284 --> 55:02.995
Drink?

55:03.078 --> 55:05.414
- Now that's rather poetic.
- What'll it be?

55:05.456 --> 55:07.833
- Nothing.
- Not a drinkin' man?

55:07.917 --> 55:10.253
No, not in an armored car.

55:11.379 --> 55:14.048
- I think I like you.
- Why?

55:14.132 --> 55:17.552
Imagination. I like a man
with imagination.

55:17.594 --> 55:19.638
You're a good newspaperman,
they say.

55:19.680 --> 55:21.765
You're not bad at your trade either.

55:21.849 --> 55:25.060
You got two Pulitzer prizes,
they say. Are they worth much?

55:25.102 --> 55:27.813
In cash, about $500 a piece.

55:27.855 --> 55:30.983
- Your kind of imagination is worth more.
- I agree.

55:31.025 --> 55:34.696
- But you're a hothead, they say.
- Who's "they"?

55:34.779 --> 55:39.117
Friends.
I got friends everywhere.

55:39.201 --> 55:41.161
I'd like for you to be my friend.

55:41.203 --> 55:43.288
- I got a friend.
- Not like me.

55:43.330 --> 55:46.125
Is that a proposal or a proposition?

55:46.208 --> 55:49.879
- What do you got against me?
- You're not my type.

55:49.962 --> 55:53.925
You ever meet me before,
do business with me?

55:54.050 --> 55:56.011
Well, maybe you got
the wrong impression of me.

55:56.094 --> 55:58.430
What kind of an impression
would you like me to have?

56:01.391 --> 56:04.395
My family reads the paper.

56:04.436 --> 56:06.439
It's not nice, what you print.

56:06.522 --> 56:11.736
I got a nice family. Sometime
I'd like for you to meet them.

56:11.778 --> 56:15.240
No point in that, unless they're
the ones that almost killed Burrows.

56:15.281 --> 56:18.994
- Burrows?
- Never beat up a reporter, they say.

56:19.035 --> 56:21.955
It's like killin' a cop on duty, they say.

56:22.039 --> 56:25.709
Never drop girls in the river,
clothed or unclothed, they say.

56:25.793 --> 56:28.296
What have I got to do
with reporters, or girls?

56:28.379 --> 56:32.175
- I'm in the cement and contractin' business.
- Capone was in insurance.

56:32.216 --> 56:34.886
- You got a sense of humor, friend.
- Then why don't you laugh?

56:35.011 --> 56:38.223
- Very funny.
- Tomorrow's newspaper will be even funnier.

56:42.603 --> 56:45.981
Ah. That's the Rienzi I like to see.

56:46.065 --> 56:48.109
This where you start shooting?

56:48.192 --> 56:50.361
What are you supposed to be,
a little tin god?

56:50.403 --> 56:53.281
You gonna save the world?
A hero or somethin'?

56:53.323 --> 56:56.618
There's only one kind of
martyr friend, dead ones.

56:56.701 --> 56:59.871
Show me a martyr, I'll lay you
4 to 1 he winds up out of the money.

56:59.913 --> 57:02.708
My lawyer says
I could sue you for this.

57:02.750 --> 57:07.296
- Well?
- What you're tryin' to do has been tried before.

57:07.338 --> 57:10.258
Nobody could ever make it stick.

57:10.299 --> 57:12.594
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

57:20.686 --> 57:24.023
Thanks for the lift.
I can't say I enjoyed it.

57:24.064 --> 57:27.193
Cops, tax collectors, politicians,
citizens' committees...

57:27.276 --> 57:29.779
They all got an angle.
What's yours? Name it.

57:29.821 --> 57:32.824
What do you want? My prizes
are worth more than pulitzers.

57:32.865 --> 57:36.328
I know. I got a look at Sally's fur coat.

57:42.084 --> 57:44.670
Wasn't that Herman Schmidt
just went in?

57:44.753 --> 57:47.715
Yeah.

57:56.558 --> 57:59.728
Okay, from the beginning.

57:59.770 --> 58:01.855
First, let's see the money.

58:01.897 --> 58:05.109
He said you'd pay for the story.

58:07.361 --> 58:09.280
Five grand.

58:11.366 --> 58:14.744
- $1,000.
- How far would that get me?

58:14.828 --> 58:19.124
Out of the country, after you
testify against Rienzi. Yes or no?

58:19.166 --> 58:23.837
- Well, he said you'd protect me.
- These days, accommodations in jail are hard to get.

58:23.921 --> 58:27.842
However, I'll use my influence.

58:27.925 --> 58:32.096
- Well?
- All right.

58:32.138 --> 58:35.350
Get some sleep, and on your way
out, have 'em send in $1,000.

58:35.392 --> 58:37.477
- In cash!
- In cash.

58:40.022 --> 58:42.691
Okay, you got the floor.

58:47.780 --> 58:51.909
- Where do you want me to start?
- Sally and Rienzi.

58:51.993 --> 58:54.037
Well, they liked each other.

58:54.078 --> 58:56.915
- Liked?
- Well, you know.

58:56.998 --> 59:01.086
- Rienzi pay her bills?
- What else?

59:01.169 --> 59:04.924
- For everything?
- She was worth it.

59:05.007 --> 59:07.051
That's what i like: family pride.

59:07.134 --> 59:09.262
Larry Hansen kicked in for the apartment,

59:09.345 --> 59:13.558
Her fur coat, some cheap
jewelry, maybe her car too.

59:13.641 --> 59:18.146
But Sally bought $40,000 worth
of government bonds in her name.

59:18.230 --> 59:20.232
Rienzi pay for that?

59:21.441 --> 59:23.444
I guess so.

59:23.485 --> 59:27.615
- You're a liar.
- Sally used the $200,000 Rienzi gave her to hold for him.

59:27.656 --> 59:29.700
What $200,000?

59:29.784 --> 59:32.412
- Why would a guy part with that kind of scratch?
- Hot money.

59:32.495 --> 59:35.874
- The city bank says your sister rented a safety deposit box.
- She gave it up a month ago.

59:35.957 --> 59:38.627
- On the same day she moved out of her apartment.
- Why?

59:41.672 --> 59:45.050
All right. It's true. He gave
her the money to keep for him.

59:45.092 --> 59:48.638
When he wanted it back, she
was scared he'd make a break.

59:48.679 --> 59:52.684
She said as long as she
kept the cash... he'd stick.

59:55.270 --> 59:57.272
Didn't work out that way.

01:00:00.776 --> 01:00:02.694
I don't feel so good.

01:00:10.036 --> 01:00:13.748
- Have this typed. More coming.
- Yes. Mrs. Garrison wants to see you in the dome.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.709
- Well, stall her.
- Here's that $1,000 you wanted.

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:17.836
Uh-huh.

01:00:19.504 --> 01:00:21.673
- Uh, Al, this camera in there.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:21.757 --> 01:00:24.009
- What did you say?
- Are you married, honey?

01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:26.512
- Cleary...
- Later, baby.

01:00:26.554 --> 01:00:29.557
Get hold of the governor. Ask him if
he'll appoint a special grand jury...

01:00:29.599 --> 01:00:31.601
to investigate
the last election.

01:00:31.726 --> 01:00:33.770
Some of the names
that'll come up.

01:00:33.811 --> 01:00:36.690
- We supported a few for office.
- A newspaper has no political party.

01:00:36.731 --> 01:00:39.234
We support men for office-
Some good, some bad.

01:00:39.317 --> 01:00:41.820
Mr. Hutcheson, Mrs. Willebrandt's on here.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:45.241
If the governor won't act, uh, get the
chairman of the state senate committee.

01:00:46.283 --> 01:00:48.244
Yes? Hutcheson.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.956
Oh, hold it.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.042
Uh, go ahead, Willebrandt.

01:00:56.044 --> 01:00:58.421
Sally? What about her?

01:01:00.007 --> 01:01:03.635
Where'd she move to?
What hotel?

01:01:03.719 --> 01:01:05.596
When did you find out
Sally was dead?

01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:07.807
Well, I- I read
about it in the paper.

01:01:07.848 --> 01:01:09.809
She was dead three days
before the papers got it.

01:01:09.892 --> 01:01:12.604
Your mother says you left the house
last Saturday and didn't come back.

01:01:12.645 --> 01:01:14.647
- Sally was killed that same night.
- So what?

01:01:14.731 --> 01:01:17.567
- I leave the house lots of times. For weeks sometimes.
- But not to hide out.

01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:20.696
You were afraid of Rienzi. Why? You knew
he was going to Sally's place last Saturday.

01:01:20.779 --> 01:01:24.617
- I didn't even know where she lived.
- Hold it. Shoot.

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:30.331
Sally was moved from
her apartment on maple avenue...

01:01:30.414 --> 01:01:33.585
by the intercity storage company
four weeks ago...

01:01:33.626 --> 01:01:38.089
to the Leroy Hotel, registered under
the name of, uh, Bessie Schmidt.

01:01:38.131 --> 01:01:42.052
Never left her room. She had only two visitors.
Your mother and you.

01:01:42.094 --> 01:01:44.680
You were there Saturday night.

01:01:44.722 --> 01:01:47.641
- I don't remember. Maybe I was.
- Why did you go there?

01:01:47.683 --> 01:01:49.727
Well, I, uh...

01:01:51.646 --> 01:01:54.524
She phoned me. Yeah,
that's right. She phoned me!

01:01:54.607 --> 01:01:58.028
The desk clerk says you phoned her
from the desk, 1:30 am

01:01:58.111 --> 01:02:01.490
He could be wrong!

01:02:01.532 --> 01:02:05.536
Yeah. That's right.

01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:09.749
Somewhere out there,
Rienzi's waiting for you.

01:02:09.832 --> 01:02:13.253
Either you tell the truth, or I'll turn
you loose. No money, no protection.

01:02:15.964 --> 01:02:18.008
Okay.

01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:21.178
- Throw him out.
- Wait.

01:02:22.387 --> 01:02:25.140
Rienzi wanted his money.

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.853
They couldn't find out
where she was living.

01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:31.272
- So you showed 'em.
- Why'd you do it?

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:34.567
- What did Rienzi promise?
- Well, he got me my job.

01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:37.696
I owed him some money.
I couldn't pay him.

01:02:37.737 --> 01:02:40.240
He said the favor
would square us.

01:02:40.282 --> 01:02:43.035
All you had to do was put
the finger on your own sister.

01:02:43.118 --> 01:02:45.830
I didn't know what they
were gonna do. I swear it.

01:02:45.913 --> 01:02:47.915
- Who went with you, Rienzi?
- I went alone.

01:02:47.999 --> 01:02:50.877
- So she wouldn't be afraid to let you in.
- They came later.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.130
- All you did was open the door for them. That's all.
- Who's "they"?

01:02:54.172 --> 01:02:57.551
- Lefty Smith, Whitey Franks and Kid Jones.
- They belong to Rienzi?

01:02:57.592 --> 01:03:00.304
- Except whitey. He hires out.
- You let 'em in. Then what?

01:03:00.387 --> 01:03:03.849
Well, they asked her
for the money.

01:03:03.932 --> 01:03:09.063
She wouldn't give,
so whitey, he hit her.

01:03:09.188 --> 01:03:12.650
Then Lefty.
She began to scream.

01:03:12.692 --> 01:03:14.569
She hollered for me
to help her.

01:03:16.738 --> 01:03:21.118
Then whitey, he shut her up.

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:26.123
I got scared. I couldn't watch what
they were doin', I ran into the bathroom.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:32.046
I beat it out of there.
That's all I know. Honest.

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.508
- Yes?
- Mrs. Garrison's still waiting. What'll I tell her?

01:03:35.592 --> 01:03:37.385
I'll be right up.

01:03:38.845 --> 01:03:41.473
The word was out Rienzi wanted me.

01:03:41.557 --> 01:03:43.559
They was afraid I was gonna sing.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.395
If I stay for the trial,
they'll get to me.

01:03:46.479 --> 01:03:48.522
You don't know them.
In jail, no matter where...

01:03:48.564 --> 01:03:50.650
Soon as that's typed,
have him sign it.

01:03:50.691 --> 01:03:52.694
We won't have time
to get this all in the bulldog.

01:03:52.735 --> 01:03:55.155
We'll get the text of the
statement in the second edition.

01:03:55.196 --> 01:03:57.824
Count it. Count it!

01:03:57.949 --> 01:03:59.785
And have this office fumigated.

01:04:09.128 --> 01:04:11.547
- Mr. Hutcheson? About Lewis Shafer
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:11.672 --> 01:04:13.800
- Uh, that information you requested.
- Uh-huh?

01:04:13.842 --> 01:04:16.428
Uh, Lewis Shafer, age 42,
born in Baltimore,

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:20.474
Only child of John and Harriet
Shafer of the chemical fortune.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.810
- Was he ever married before?
- No, sir.

01:04:22.851 --> 01:04:26.772
- Ever get pinched? Was he ever arrested?
- No record, if he was.

01:04:26.814 --> 01:04:29.817
Alcoholic? Swindler?

01:04:29.859 --> 01:04:32.946
Maybe he's a fiend.
You know, he looked like one.

01:04:33.071 --> 01:04:35.782
Check his army record?
Maybe he's a spy.

01:04:35.824 --> 01:04:38.702
Got the silver star
and the purple heart.

01:04:38.785 --> 01:04:42.414
- That's a rotten report.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:42.498 --> 01:04:45.125
Eddie, two things.

01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:49.046
Rienzi's started his libel suit. We were
served with the papers half an hour ago.

01:04:49.088 --> 01:04:52.759
- Second?
- Judge Mckay is gonna hand down a decision tonight at 9:00.

01:04:52.842 --> 01:04:55.887
- Because of the libel suit? We'll be ready for him.
- And another thing,

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:59.182
That one percent you were
promised when we sold the paper?

01:04:59.266 --> 01:05:01.351
Well, Alice and kitty
have withdrawn it.

01:05:01.393 --> 01:05:03.437
- What took 'em so long?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.481
You were wonderful today, baby.

01:05:05.522 --> 01:05:08.109
- Oh. Mr. Blake and Mr. Green, this is Mr. Hutcheson.
- How do you do?

01:05:08.234 --> 01:05:10.403
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

01:05:10.486 --> 01:05:14.115
Their banking firm has offered to lend us
the extra money to meet Mr. White's offer.

01:05:14.199 --> 01:05:16.743
- Pending a few facts, of course
- Of course.

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:19.746
Try to remember Rienzi's exact
words when he asked you...

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:21.874
to bring the three hoods
to Sally's hotel room.

01:05:21.915 --> 01:05:23.917
We can get that...

01:05:24.001 --> 01:05:26.670
Got a warrant here
for Herman Schmidt.

01:05:26.796 --> 01:05:29.549
We're not finished yet. We
want him to sign the statement.

01:05:29.674 --> 01:05:33.177
- It'll only take a few minutes.
- Come along, Schmidt. You got no right to take statements.

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:35.388
- As long as it's not a police state, we have.
- Sorry.

01:05:38.308 --> 01:05:41.019
- Whitey!
- Shut up.

01:05:41.061 --> 01:05:43.188
Take him out the back way.

01:05:43.313 --> 01:05:45.858
I didn't tell him anythi...

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:51.114
Whitey, I didn't tell 'em anything.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:56.077
And that doesn't include
the higher cost of newsprint.

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:59.748
- How's that?
- It keeps going up. Right now, it's $110 a ton.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:02.459
In 1942, it was $50 a ton.

01:06:02.543 --> 01:06:06.255
Takes talent to get the news, think it
through, write it and back it up with research.

01:06:06.297 --> 01:06:09.050
Without good reporting,
you haven't got a paper.

01:06:09.091 --> 01:06:12.804
- That extra four percent...
- Might make it dangerous venture.

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:17.100
A free press, sir, like a
free life, is always in danger.

01:06:19.603 --> 01:06:21.939
That's why I hid out, 'cause
I knew somebody would get me.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.608
- Listen. You gotta believe me.
- Ah, shut up.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.110
You do believe me,
don't you?

01:07:01.732 --> 01:07:05.110
I like the proposition.

01:07:05.194 --> 01:07:08.739
- Barring unforeseen complications, I think...
- Ed, it's for you.

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.744
Yeah?

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:39.523
Give him a description of what
that so-called police look like.

01:07:39.564 --> 01:07:42.526
Yes, Captain.

01:07:42.568 --> 01:07:45.863
When's the press gonna grow up
and stop playing detective?

01:07:45.905 --> 01:07:48.366
Can't you tell the difference
between a hoodlum and a cop?

01:07:48.449 --> 01:07:50.827
- In this town?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:54.998
Captain.

01:07:55.081 --> 01:07:57.125
Got the address?

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.252
Now see that Mrs. Garrison
gets home all right.

01:07:59.336 --> 01:08:01.338
What about Schmidt's confession?
We run anyway?

01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:05.259
Without his signature? That
judge would surely close us down.

01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:09.513
You made a mess of it.

01:08:09.597 --> 01:08:12.266
I told you
I don't want no violence.

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:14.394
Not yet, anyway.

01:08:14.477 --> 01:08:17.354
There's a time and place for this
kind of thing. This is stupid.

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:24.404
No. No.
Run away from what?

01:08:24.446 --> 01:08:27.116
I'll talk to them myself,
personally.

01:08:27.241 --> 01:08:30.243
Get 'em down here
to my office, all of 'em.

01:08:30.328 --> 01:08:34.374
Sure, now. Right now.
You too.

01:08:34.415 --> 01:08:38.127
And find Sally's old lady, Mrs. Schmidt.
Bring her in. I wanna talk to her.

01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:40.839
And this time,
don't foul it up.

01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:49.098
No paper ever did a better,
faster, more thorough job.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:54.145
All we needed was that one
bit of evidence, and we had it.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:57.732
Why do you think we hung the
whole thing on Rienzi's case?

01:08:57.774 --> 01:09:01.528
'Cause we were sentimental about
a dead girl and a mink coat? No.

01:09:01.612 --> 01:09:06.367
No, we had something big,
big enough to save our necks.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:10.162
Rienzi in the liquor business,
the financial department dug that one up.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.707
Distributed for two of the
biggest name brands.

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:16.127
Rienzi's brother runs
a wire service for race results,

01:09:16.169 --> 01:09:21.966
Transportation, a loan agency for
bookies, real estate, hotels, nightclubs.

01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:24.678
Slot machines, et cetera, et cetera.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:30.225
Years ago, my husband tried to do a
story like this on a man just like Rienzi.

01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:34.063
No, I figured with a story like this
to tell, they'd never close us down.

01:09:35.231 --> 01:09:38.026
Well...

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.904
We showed 'em how a real
newspaper can function.

01:09:40.988 --> 01:09:44.491
And now, we're licked, baby.

01:09:44.533 --> 01:09:46.410
Put a head on this, will you?

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:54.294
My husband always said if it was a
worthwhile fight, didn't matter who won.

01:09:54.335 --> 01:09:56.504
Some good was sure
to come out of it.

01:09:59.674 --> 01:10:02.219
- That Rienzi's wine?
- Uh-huh.

01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:05.514
- Pretty good.
- The best.

01:10:06.765 --> 01:10:09.769
- Well, you're quite a girl.
- Yeah.

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.397
Guess they made 'em different
in your day.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.191
- Yeah.
- More durable.

01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:17.611
More pliable.

01:10:17.694 --> 01:10:23.033
Girls these days have stuff, but
they're... brittle, break more easily,

01:10:23.075 --> 01:10:25.077
Don't roll with the punches.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.830
Plenty of gall and no guts.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.253
- Meaning Nora?
- Uh, meaning Nora.

01:10:33.294 --> 01:10:38.425
There will now be a respectful silence
while we feel sorry for ourselves.

01:10:38.508 --> 01:10:42.012
- Well, she had no right to walk out on me.
- Why not?

01:10:42.054 --> 01:10:44.848
- Well, because.
- Because it inconvenienced you.

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:46.934
Because she's my wife.

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:51.689
You wouldn't have had a wife if that
newspaper had had beautiful legs.

01:10:51.773 --> 01:10:55.151
Sure, sure.

01:10:55.235 --> 01:10:58.864
- You never walked out on John.
- Who said so? Twice.

01:10:58.947 --> 01:11:01.116
- You must've had a pretty good reason.
- The best.

01:11:01.158 --> 01:11:04.828
The bride always likes to think
she's indispensable,

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:07.540
Even in the morning.

01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:10.001
I woke up, and he was gone.

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:13.922
Gone back to the paper,
to do the Lusitania story.

01:11:14.005 --> 01:11:16.383
- I walked out.
- Ah, but you came back.

01:11:16.466 --> 01:11:20.554
Two days later. He didn't
even know I'd been gone.

01:11:20.637 --> 01:11:23.474
- But he loved you.
- Passionately,

01:11:23.515 --> 01:11:25.559
But between editions.

01:11:25.643 --> 01:11:29.897
He had time to change the face
of journalism, fight for reform,

01:11:29.939 --> 01:11:34.444
And crusade for a thousand lost causes,
but he had no time for his family.

01:11:34.486 --> 01:11:38.949
So I took my two daughters and
left this big, beautiful mausoleum.

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:42.703
- Why did you come back?
- Well, we needed each other.

01:11:42.786 --> 01:11:45.039
It was I who did
the adjusting, though.

01:11:45.122 --> 01:11:49.085
It wasn't Alice or kitty
or John.

01:11:49.126 --> 01:11:52.296
He needed a son
to carry on the paper.

01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:55.759
And they needed a father
to love, not a bulldog edition.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.512
- Enter me.
- Spittin' image.

01:12:01.265 --> 01:12:04.643
- And what did you want?
- To be useful.

01:12:04.727 --> 01:12:06.687
Well...

01:12:06.771 --> 01:12:09.106
To newspapers.

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:13.319
To editors like you,
a publisher's delight.

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:19.201
Don't blame Nora.

01:12:19.284 --> 01:12:23.831
Unless she wants to come back,
it won't work. If she stays away...

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:27.209
I can look for a newspaper
with nice legs.

01:12:27.334 --> 01:12:29.837
Court convenes in
about half an hour.

01:12:29.921 --> 01:12:32.006
- You gonna be there?
- Maybe.

01:12:35.468 --> 01:12:38.013
- Will you marry me?
- You're too old.

01:12:41.433 --> 01:12:43.852
You go through old lady
Schmidt's house? Top to bottom.

01:12:43.894 --> 01:12:45.896
- Well?
- Nothing.

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.107
- Mrs. Schmidt, you find her?
- Not yet.

01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:50.568
- Got anybody at the house waitin' for her?
- Inside and out.

01:12:50.651 --> 01:12:55.281
Don't bring her here. I don't
want none of your boys around here.

01:12:55.323 --> 01:12:57.534
- Now or anytime. You understand?
- I understand.

01:12:57.576 --> 01:13:01.788
And don't phone me,
here or at home, any of you!

01:13:01.872 --> 01:13:05.000
- Would it be better if we left town for a while?
- No. We stay put.

01:13:05.042 --> 01:13:07.420
- Suppose the grand jury indicts?
- Leave 'em indict!

01:13:07.461 --> 01:13:10.089
- Larry'll take care of things.
- I'll try.

01:13:10.214 --> 01:13:14.969
That's right. You'll try.
I don't want no panic...

01:13:15.011 --> 01:13:18.682
if there's an investigation
or even a trial.

01:13:18.765 --> 01:13:21.685
We been through this kind of thing
before. We're still in business.

01:13:21.768 --> 01:13:24.772
Our story's printed
in the paper. So what?

01:13:24.855 --> 01:13:26.857
Tomorrow, it's old news.
Next week, people forget.

01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:28.985
But if they keep printing?

01:13:29.026 --> 01:13:31.654
- They won't.
- But if they keep us in the news until the trial,

01:13:31.738 --> 01:13:35.033
- If they heat up the public...
- You take care of your end. I'll handle the paper.

01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:37.577
- Hutcheson won't handle easily.
- He's got nothing.

01:13:37.619 --> 01:13:39.621
With Schmidt out of the way,
what's he got?

01:13:39.663 --> 01:13:41.582
- That won't stop him.
- And he won't stop us!

01:13:43.459 --> 01:13:45.461
Tomorrow, he won't even have a paper.

01:13:45.544 --> 01:13:47.963
Courts'll take it away from him.

01:13:48.047 --> 01:13:52.927
And if they don't, we'll
take him away from the paper.

01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:55.722
Maybe they all need an example.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.641
Yeah, that's what they need.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:05.608
- You better find Hutcheson.
- You wanna see him?

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.693
No.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:20.332
Mrs. Garrison? How are you?

01:14:27.173 --> 01:14:29.258
Please rise.

01:14:35.765 --> 01:14:37.726
His honor, the surrogate.

01:14:37.767 --> 01:14:39.770
Please be seated.

01:14:46.443 --> 01:14:48.738
I'm a little bit worried about him.

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:58.331
Regarding the sale and purchase
of the publishing company...

01:14:58.373 --> 01:15:00.667
herein referred to as "the day"...

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:07.466
I've made a careful study
of the existing contract...

01:15:07.508 --> 01:15:12.513
between the heirs of the late John Garrison
and Lawrence white publishing enterprises.

01:15:12.555 --> 01:15:17.060
I can see no reason why this
contract should not be enforced.

01:15:17.143 --> 01:15:22.357
Therefore, unless further evidence or
argument is presented to alter my judgment,

01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:27.029
The court is prepared
to render its decision.

01:15:27.113 --> 01:15:30.283
Mrs. Garrison,
do you have anything to add?

01:15:30.366 --> 01:15:32.368
Do you want to say anything?

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:34.496
No statement, your honor.

01:15:34.579 --> 01:15:39.084
Your honor, before you decide,
may I say something?

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:42.921
If your honor please, I don't think
this gentleman is one of the heirs.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:48.427
He's not here as amicus curiae, and I'm positive
he's not here in the interests of Mr. White.

01:15:48.469 --> 01:15:50.596
Whom does he presume to represent?

01:15:50.596 --> 01:15:53.892
Well, sir, I'm trying
to save a newspaper.

01:15:53.933 --> 01:15:56.311
Which is not yours
in the first place.

01:15:56.394 --> 01:16:01.358
That is true. The day consists of
a big building. I don't own that.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.614
It also consists of typewriters, teletypes,
presses, newsprint, ink and desks.

01:16:06.655 --> 01:16:09.867
I don't own those either. But
this newspaper is more than that.

01:16:09.951 --> 01:16:12.495
We're all aware
of what a newspaper consists.

01:16:12.537 --> 01:16:14.497
I'm not so sure about that.

01:16:16.333 --> 01:16:20.796
The Day is... more than a building.
It's people.

01:16:20.837 --> 01:16:24.466
It's 1500 men and women whose skill,
heart, brains and experience...

01:16:24.508 --> 01:16:26.760
make a great newspaper possible.

01:16:26.844 --> 01:16:29.722
We don't own one stick
of furniture in this company.

01:16:29.805 --> 01:16:33.851
But we, along with the 290,000
people who read this paper,

01:16:33.935 --> 01:16:35.979
Have a vital interest
in whether it lives or dies.

01:16:36.146 --> 01:16:38.106
This is highly irregular procedure.

01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:40.233
So is the murder
of a newspaper!

01:16:40.275 --> 01:16:42.361
Aren't you carrying this
a bit too far?

01:16:42.444 --> 01:16:45.030
The death of a newspaper
sometimes has far-Reaching effects.

01:16:45.072 --> 01:16:47.408
- Meaning your own pocketbook in this case.
- In this case,

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:49.577
Meaning some unfinished business
called Rienzi.

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.704
If you read the day,
you'd know what I mean.

01:16:51.788 --> 01:16:54.457
- I don't care to discuss Mr. Rienzi.
- This newspaper does!

01:16:54.499 --> 01:16:56.292
This doesn't concern us
here today.

01:16:56.376 --> 01:16:58.378
It concerns the public
every day.

01:16:58.461 --> 01:17:00.547
A newspaper, as Mr. White will agree,

01:17:00.589 --> 01:17:03.175
Is published first, last and
always in the public interest.

01:17:03.217 --> 01:17:05.719
Yours is not
the only newspaper in town.

01:17:05.761 --> 01:17:08.681
Right now, it's the only
newspaper willing to expose Rienzi.

01:17:08.723 --> 01:17:11.350
- Your honor.
- An honest, fearless press...

01:17:11.392 --> 01:17:13.770
is the public's first protection
against gangsterism,

01:17:13.811 --> 01:17:15.814
Local or international.

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:20.235
Mr. Hutcheson, though
a surrogates court is informal,

01:17:20.318 --> 01:17:22.571
There are certain rules
and procedure.

01:17:22.654 --> 01:17:24.281
May we have
your decision now, sir?

01:17:25.824 --> 01:17:30.288
As one of your 290,000 readers,
Mr. Hutcheson,

01:17:30.329 --> 01:17:34.334
I rule that... you may proceed
with your statement.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:36.503
Thank you, sir.

01:17:36.628 --> 01:17:40.757
But let's try to keep this from
becoming a personal matter, please.

01:17:40.841 --> 01:17:43.469
Well, a newspaper's a very
personal matter, sir.

01:17:43.552 --> 01:17:45.638
Ask the people
who let us in their homes.

01:17:45.679 --> 01:17:49.433
I've read the day
for more than 35 years.

01:17:49.517 --> 01:17:52.186
Before that,
I sold it in the streets.

01:17:52.228 --> 01:17:55.356
However, here
we're only concerned...

01:17:55.398 --> 01:17:58.652
With the legal aspect of the
sale and purchase of property.

01:17:58.693 --> 01:18:01.238
What happens after
Mr. White takes possession...

01:18:01.321 --> 01:18:03.365
Is outside of the
jurisdiction of this court.

01:18:03.449 --> 01:18:05.701
Well, in whose
jurisdiction is it?

01:18:05.743 --> 01:18:10.373
Just a moment. Since when is it immoral
for someone to legally purchase a newspaper?

01:18:10.414 --> 01:18:15.920
I don't care if Mr. White buys and runs
two papers or 20 papers or 100 papers.

01:18:15.962 --> 01:18:19.090
Some of the best newspapers in
this country are part of a chain.

01:18:19.132 --> 01:18:21.843
But I do care when he buys a
newspaper to put it out of business!

01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:27.808
Because without competition, there
can be no freedom of the press.

01:18:27.892 --> 01:18:30.311
And I'm talking about
free enterprise, your honor,

01:18:30.394 --> 01:18:35.150
The right of the public to a
marketplace of ideas, news and opinions.

01:18:35.191 --> 01:18:39.321
Not of one man's or one leader's
or even one government's.

01:18:39.404 --> 01:18:42.032
I...

01:18:42.074 --> 01:18:45.494
Well, I guess
that's all I have to say.

01:18:48.414 --> 01:18:53.503
The existing contract is valid,
made in good faith.

01:18:54.754 --> 01:18:57.382
As of tomorrow, November 14th,

01:18:57.465 --> 01:19:01.553
The Lawrence white publications
will assume control of The Day.

01:19:01.595 --> 01:19:03.514
Court adjourned.

01:19:07.518 --> 01:19:10.354
Well, thanks for trying.

01:19:10.438 --> 01:19:14.150
- There'll be another day. Goodbye, Ed.
- Goodbye.

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:22.576
Here you are, Mr. Hutcheson.
I have the city desk.

01:19:22.659 --> 01:19:25.162
Frank? Here it is.

01:19:25.245 --> 01:19:27.415
Lead-off for the morning edition.

01:19:27.498 --> 01:19:32.253
"The day, after 47 years of daily
publication, was sold last night."

01:19:32.337 --> 01:19:34.547
Ed, get back here
as quick as you can.

01:19:34.631 --> 01:19:36.633
Yeah, well give it to me
over the phone.

01:19:40.887 --> 01:19:43.056
I'll be right there.
Five minutes.

01:19:45.142 --> 01:19:48.104
Would you care to state who
killed your daughter, Mrs. Schmidt?

01:19:48.145 --> 01:19:51.274
- Was it Rienzi?
- Some of his men?

01:19:51.357 --> 01:19:53.526
I come to see boss.

01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:56.655
Did you know your son
was working for Rienzi?

01:19:56.696 --> 01:19:59.449
Was that Hutch?

01:19:59.491 --> 01:20:02.828
Do you think
we ought to call the police?

01:20:02.911 --> 01:20:04.997
I'm worried about her.

01:20:08.876 --> 01:20:12.130
Paper's been sold.
Write a new lead.

01:20:39.576 --> 01:20:41.495
Coffee.

01:20:42.996 --> 01:20:45.416
Have you been to
your home yet, Mrs. Schmidt?

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:50.630
- Where you been?
- I speak to boss.

01:20:55.969 --> 01:20:59.973
Mrs. Schmidt wandered in,
on her own, looking for you.

01:21:00.057 --> 01:21:02.559
Won't talk to anyone else.

01:21:02.643 --> 01:21:05.271
Mrs. Schmidt, the boss.

01:21:05.396 --> 01:21:07.356
How do you do, Mrs. Schmidt?

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.359
- Your name, please?
- Hutcheson.

01:21:10.443 --> 01:21:12.362
I am mother to Bessie.

01:21:14.656 --> 01:21:18.785
Oh, uh, about your son...
I'm very sorry.

01:21:18.869 --> 01:21:20.829
I do not come for that.

01:21:28.421 --> 01:21:30.298
Sit down, please.

01:21:31.841 --> 01:21:34.219
Here.

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:39.307
My Bessie, she comes to me
and she says,

01:21:39.349 --> 01:21:42.728
"Here, mama. You keep this.

01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:46.857
Something happens to me,
you do not have to worry."

01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:50.653
This is Bessie's diary?

01:21:50.695 --> 01:21:56.284
She says what happens to her
and this Mr. Rienzi.

01:22:00.747 --> 01:22:04.084
- Yes, sir?
- Get Captain Finlay over here right away.

01:22:04.126 --> 01:22:07.046
And tell Allen we're getting
out the final edition as usual.

01:22:07.129 --> 01:22:09.006
Yes, sir!

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.344
Why didn't you go
to the police, Mrs. Schmidt?

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:18.225
Police?
I do not know police.

01:22:18.308 --> 01:22:22.271
I know newspaper.
This newspaper.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:25.482
For 31 years,
I know this paper.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:29.904
I come to America.
I wish to be good citizen.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:33.658
How to do this?
From newspaper.

01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:36.619
It shows me
how to read and write.

01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:41.333
My Bessie dies, you do not say
bad things of her.

01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:44.461
You do not show
bad pictures of her.

01:22:44.545 --> 01:22:49.717
You try to find...
who hurt my Bessie.

01:22:51.719 --> 01:22:54.430
Good. I help.

01:22:54.556 --> 01:22:58.185
I think what to do.
I go on subway.

01:22:58.268 --> 01:23:02.481
I ride all day.
I think. I come.

01:23:04.441 --> 01:23:07.695
By doing this, you may be
in danger, like your son.

01:23:07.778 --> 01:23:10.323
You are not afraid.

01:23:11.532 --> 01:23:13.409
Your paper's not afraid.

01:23:14.577 --> 01:23:16.538
I am not afraid.

01:23:29.176 --> 01:23:32.930
Hello, Mrs. Hutcheson.
Or is it... Mrs. Shafer now?

01:23:32.972 --> 01:23:34.891
- Where is he?
- In the press room.

01:23:37.394 --> 01:23:39.938
- Has he lost the paper yet?
- Yes.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.107
What's he gonna do?

01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:45.945
Get out the last edition, and
it ought to be quite a paper.

01:23:45.986 --> 01:23:49.448
- But then what?
- Look for another job, I guess.

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:52.243
Is it Mrs. Shafer?

01:23:52.368 --> 01:23:54.329
No.

01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.543
- Hello, Alex.
- This is it, huh?

01:23:59.668 --> 01:24:02.379
Yeah. Looks like our last one.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.646
Phone, Mr. Hutcheson.

01:24:25.279 --> 01:24:28.866
Yes? Who?

01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:32.954
Well, put the call through.

01:24:39.044 --> 01:24:41.672
- Hutcheson?
- Hello, baby.

01:24:43.674 --> 01:24:48.179
How am I feeling? I hear Mrs.
Schmidt come in to see you.

01:24:48.262 --> 01:24:52.058
That's right. That's right.

01:24:52.141 --> 01:24:57.188
There's some loose cash here
belongs to you, $200,000 worth.

01:24:57.272 --> 01:24:59.232
Uh-huh, and there's
something else too.

01:25:04.071 --> 01:25:06.699
What diary?

01:25:06.782 --> 01:25:10.411
Who's gonna believe what a
little tramp writes to herself?

01:25:10.495 --> 01:25:12.538
Wait a minute!
Don't hang up!

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:14.582
Here's some advice
for you, friend.

01:25:14.666 --> 01:25:17.294
Don't press your luck.
Lay off of me.

01:25:17.335 --> 01:25:19.337
Don't print that story.

01:25:19.379 --> 01:25:22.257
What's that supposed to be?
An order?

01:25:22.299 --> 01:25:26.220
If not tonight, then tomorrow.
Maybe next week. Maybe next year.

01:25:26.262 --> 01:25:28.305
But sooner or later,
you'll catch it!

01:25:28.347 --> 01:25:32.310
Listen to me! Print that
story, you're a dead man!

01:25:32.352 --> 01:25:36.690
It's not just me anymore. You'd have to
stop every newspaper in the country now,

01:25:36.773 --> 01:25:38.859
And you're not big enough
for that job.

01:25:38.942 --> 01:25:42.696
People like you have tried it before,
with bullets, prison, censorship,

01:25:42.738 --> 01:25:46.033
But as long as even one newspaper
will print the truth, you're finished.

01:25:46.116 --> 01:25:49.996
Don't give me that fancy double-talk!
I want an answer. Yes or no?

01:26:03.469 --> 01:26:06.972
Yes or no?

01:26:09.934 --> 01:26:12.478
Hey! Hutcheson?

01:26:12.562 --> 01:26:14.522
That noise.
What's that racket?

01:26:14.564 --> 01:26:18.151
That's the press, baby,
the press,

01:26:18.235 --> 01:26:21.280
And there's nothing
you can do about it. Nothing.
