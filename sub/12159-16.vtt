THAN THAT CHAIN-SMOKING BABY
ON THE INTERNET.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.773
BABIES CAN SMOKE?

08:28.775 --> 08:30.475
YES, BOYD.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.844
BECAUSE CONSTANTLY
THROWING UP AND POOPING

08:32.846 --> 08:35.046
DOESN'T MAKE THEM
DISGUSTING ENOUGH.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.682
WHY DON'T YOU GO UPSTAIRS
AND PLAY BEFORE DINNER, OKAY?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.384
OKAY.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.721
IT'S GREAT THAT RYAN'S SELFIES
ARE STARTING TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.155
HE'S BEEN
TRAVELING SO MUCH,

08:44.157 --> 08:45.657
HE'S HAD TO NEGLECT
HIS OTHER CAUSES.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.992
I KNOW.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.693
NOW'S THE TIME
TO CHOP DOWN THE RAINFORESTS

08:48.695 --> 08:49.895
AND PIG OUT ON DOLPHIN.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.831
DO NOT SAY THAT
AROUND DAD.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.499
HE'LL WANT TO SERVE DOLPHIN
BURGERS AT OUTDOOR MAN GRILL.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.800

YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:55.802 --> 08:57.969
LET'S GET POLITICS OUT
BEFORE DINNER

08:57.971 --> 08:59.738
BECAUSE I AM MAKING
A GREEK SALAD HERE,

08:59.740 --> 09:02.073
WHICH SOMEHOW YOUR FATHER
WILL TURN INTO A LECTURE

09:02.075 --> 09:04.075
ON THE DECLINE
OF THE EURO.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.378
I'VE NOTICED A DECLINE
IN EUROS LATELY, TOO.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.015
I THINK THEY'RE GETTING REALLY
STINGY WITH THAT YOGURT SAUCE.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.184
WELL, LOOK WHO'S
ALL DRESSED UP.
WOW! YEAH.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.454

09:17.924 --> 09:19.991
YEAH, FOR OUR SINS.
BUT THEN HE CAME BACK.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.860
THERE'S A WHOLE BOOK
ABOUT IT.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.228
HOW WAS CHURCH, BABE?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.729
OH, REAL GOOD.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.531
I HADN'T BEEN TO A SUNDAY
MORNING SERVICE IN MONTHS.

09:26.533 --> 09:31.002
AND THE SERMON WAS GREAT.
WE ARE ALL DOOMED.

WERE ON A DELIVERY RUN TO YUMA.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.008

TO THE ATTENTION OF THE MAN.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.348
AND THE MAN IS
COMING DOWN ON ME, MAN.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.884
OH, I AM REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, MAN.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.920
OH, GOD, NOW YOU
GOT ME SAYING IT.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.089
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
GONE UP AGAINST GOD.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.591
HE CAN BE VERY VENGEFUL.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.593
I THOUGHT THAT GOD
WAS PURE LOVE.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.429
YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT
A BIG WUSS ABOUT IT.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.864
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HOW LONG
ARE YOU GONNA BE SUSPENDED?

09:59.866 --> 10:01.566
JUST TILL I TAKE DOWN
THE PROTEST SELFIES.

STARTING TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE,

10:03.437 --> 10:04.936
THEY TAKE AWAY MY VOICE.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.205

YOU DOING HERE?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.647
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
TOO, MIKE.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.782
KRIS SAID YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT
TO SUNDAY DINNER.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.251
THE ONLY VEGETABLE I GOT
WAS CHICKEN.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.321
RYAN GOT SUSPENDED
OVER HIS PROTEST SELFIES.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.323
YEAH, HE HAD TO TURN
IN HIS BEADED BACKREST

10:25.325 --> 10:28.793
AND HIS TINY, LITTLE
PINE-TREE AIR FRESHENER.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.730
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU CANNOT LOSE THAT JOB.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.565

AND TAKE DOWN THE PHOTOS.

YOUR COMPANY'S RIGHT

10:40.240 --> 10:42.073

SHOULDN'T HAVE WORN YOUR UNIFORM

ABOUT WORLD PROBLEMS.

THEY DRINK BEER.

YOU GET TO DO YOUR VLOGS
AND EXPRESS YOUR OPINION
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.692

APPROVES OF MY MESSAGE.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.861
OF COURSE,
<i>YOU'RE</i> MANAGEMENT.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.431

THE APPROVAL PROCESS.

WANT TO HAVE FREE SPEECH,

A FIGHT WITH GOD,

11:16.043 --> 11:17.676
YOU COULD HAVE COME WITH ME
TO CHURCH.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.444

HAVE USED ANOTHER TENOR

11:19.446 --> 11:20.879

OF KYLE.

AND EXERCISED HIS RIGHT

11:25.619 --> 11:27.018
TO WORSHIP
AS HE SEES FIT.

BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE FIT.

THE ORIGINAL LEFTY.

AND THE SANDALS FOOL YOU.

WITH BIG GOVERNMENT.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.173

FOR YOUR SUPPORT, MIKE.
