- Who do you guys,
like, not wanna see?

23:33.612 --> 23:34.647
- Shanae.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.181
She'll just [bleep]
with everyone.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.150
- But even if Shanae walked
out, I wouldn't give a [bleep].

23:38.217 --> 23:39.418
Just leave me alone.
- That's what I'm saying.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.586
- Just leave me alone.
- Exactly.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.887
But she's going
to [bleep] with you.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.422
- Yeah.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.890
- You had one of the most
dramatic journeys

23:44.957 --> 23:46.692
ever on the show.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.460
How are you hoping this
experiences is for you?

23:48.527 --> 23:50.596
- Honestly, just being me.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.264
New season.
It's Paradise.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.265
Like, let's have some fun.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.533
- She'll act very charming.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.601
She's beautiful.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.069
She's sweet, like,
to your face.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.470
But then she goes to interviews
and it's,

23:58.537 --> 24:00.205
like, absolutely horrible.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.674
- Do you think
some of these women

24:01.740 --> 24:03.108
can keep your name
out of their mouths?

24:03.175 --> 24:05.878
- I mean, hey,
I am Shanae, so--

24:05.945 --> 24:07.146
- Okay.
Have fun.

24:07.212 --> 24:08.580
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.049

your way on down there.

- You guys.

is the calm before the storm?

24:21.860 --> 24:24.964
- Sounds like
trouble's on its way.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.165

I'm Michael.

24:36.775 --> 24:37.977
- Hi, I'm Shanae.
- Nice to meet you.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.111
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

24:39.178 --> 24:40.179
- I'm good.
How are you?

24:40.245 --> 24:41.814
- Hey.
- Shanae is beautiful.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.782
I mean, her eyes,
they draw you in.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.551
She's got some
beautiful green eyes.

24:45.617 --> 24:46.652
- How is everyone?
- Good.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.653
How are you?
- We're good.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.654
- It's good to be here.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.522
- Shanae-Nae is here.

24:50.589 --> 24:53.025
She really doubled down
on Clayton's season,

24:53.092 --> 24:55.794
so I have no faith in
her, to be quite honest.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.529
What, did she just take
all the men?

24:57.596 --> 24:59.765
- Are you cool with
everyone back here now or?

24:59.832 --> 25:02.534
- I don't know if I'm
cool with everyone,

25:02.601 --> 25:04.570
but I'm trying to have fun
and enjoy my experience

25:04.636 --> 25:05.838
for once.
- Absolutely.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.439
- I don't know
what she's gonna do.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.208
I just have a feeling whoever
I have a connection with,

25:09.274 --> 25:11.510
Shanae will, I don't know,
probably take him

25:11.577 --> 25:13.145
just to maybe try to get to me.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.980
- Here I go.
- Make friends.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.049
- We'll be watching.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.650
- Oh, here she comes.

25:18.717 --> 25:19.685
Don't look.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.253
Okay, cool, everyone look.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.254
- Well, how are you gonna say?

25:22.321 --> 25:23.555
- Hi.

25:23.622 --> 25:24.590
- Hello.

25:24.656 --> 25:25.657
all: Hi.

25:25.724 --> 25:26.658
- How are you?
- I'm good.

25:26.725 --> 25:27.659
How are you?

25:27.726 --> 25:28.727
- Have a seat.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.029
How are you feeling?
- I'm good.

25:30.095 --> 25:31.864
I'm here.
New Shanae.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.932
I want y'all to--
- New Shanae.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.401
- I want y'all to see
the fun, outgoing--

25:35.467 --> 25:36.402
- Tell us about her.

25:36.468 --> 25:37.569
- Okay, Shanae 2.0.

25:37.636 --> 25:38.570
- Okay.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.040
- Inside, I'm losing my mind.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.308
She can really turn it on
when she wants to.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.844
And so I do think
that a lot of the guys

25:45.911 --> 25:47.980
probably have seen the season.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.982
And hopefully,
they will be cautious.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.450
- I'll say she
had gorgeous eyes.

25:51.517 --> 25:52.484
- Yeah.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.887
- Like, the green was glowing.

25:54.953 --> 25:56.622
- She's prettier in person,
for sure.

25:56.688 --> 25:58.090
- That suit that matched
the eyes,

25:58.157 --> 25:59.258
that was the perfect
combination.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.659
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She looks great.

26:00.726 --> 26:01.760
- And I found her
very confident.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.328
- Yeah, me too.
- We'll see.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.264
- I'm just so scared
that I'm going

26:05.330 --> 26:09.334
to end up falling for someone
and Shanae ruins it.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.770
- Justin.
What's up, man?

26:11.837 --> 26:13.305

coming, but happy to be here.

- One of the things
that you're most famous for

is the iconic Justin faces
that we saw

26:24.083 --> 26:25.818

- There's a couple of 'em.

through some of these?

26:39.898 --> 26:41.600
- This is you walking down
the stairs of Paradise.

26:41.667 --> 26:45.404
- First day in Paradise,
the sun is not quite out,

26:45.471 --> 26:47.806
so the guns
aren't gonna be quite out.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.475

I know things tend

So I'm cool
with the breeze for now.

How are you?

he's funny, and he's goofy,

27:18.804 --> 27:20.472
and he has, like,
a sensitive side.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.574
And that's all very
important to me.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.575
- Did you think
he smelled good?

27:23.642 --> 27:24.610
- I did.
- He has good cologne.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.680
I think he's very handsome.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.582
But when it comes down
to it, personality

27:30.649 --> 27:31.583
is, like, the biggest thing.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.585
So I have to talk to him.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.888
And then after I talk to him,
it's either gonna be, like,

27:35.954 --> 27:39.558

27:41.260 --> 27:42.427
