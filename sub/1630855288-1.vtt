really sunk in.

all the little people, okay?

07:00.879 --> 07:03.048
I don't know, I think
that nerd fame's going to go
straight to my head.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.633
I am just so stoked for you.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.052
You totally deserve it.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.804
I keep pinching myself
to make sure I'm not dreaming.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.806
Pinching is my department.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.100
Hmm. Someone's
getting possessive.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.852
Maybe a little.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.104
Too much?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.356
No.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.450
Aren't they pretty?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.827

07:32.827 --> 07:34.621

to impress some stranger?

07:38.917 --> 07:41.586

to get here.

is give her a warm welcome.

-No one, I swear.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.416
Well, someone talked.
The sheriff's been
asking questions.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.001
It wasn't me.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.712
It's gonna be double now.
Unless you don't want it?

09:31.154 --> 09:34.240
Wow. It looks
just like the pictures!

09:34.240 --> 09:36.493
Gosh, you guys are so lucky
to live right by the water.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.994
I could stare
at that view all day.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.121
Debbie:
Ah, we never get tired of it.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.290
Lily:
Where are you from?

09:42.290 --> 09:46.669
Well, I was born in New York,
but we left the States
when I was six months old.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.254
I've lived all over the place.

09:48.254 --> 09:53.384
I've lived in India, Malaysia,
England, Argentina, Japan...

09:53.384 --> 09:55.011
Just... everywhere.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.679
My parents are diplomats, so...

09:56.679 --> 09:59.474
Wow! Isn't she
incredible, Megan?

10:01.184 --> 10:02.602
Isabella:
Um, open it.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.566
It's beautiful.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.360
Well, it was made
for those gorgeous flowers.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.907
Uh, Lily? This is for you.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.076
If you don't like it,
we can always just, like, go

10:18.076 --> 10:19.994
and exchange it for
something else, but, um...

10:19.994 --> 10:22.330
I love it. Thank you.
Perfect.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.084
Megan. This is for you.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.168

10:29.295 --> 10:30.797

10:30.797 --> 10:33.341
Your mom said that
you liked mysteries, so...

10:37.303 --> 10:38.513

11:56.382 --> 11:57.634
Seriously?

11:57.634 --> 11:59.677
Sorry, um--um...

12:12.315 --> 12:14.651
God, I love shopping
your closet.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.861
That color really makes
your eyes pop.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.821
Can I wear this to Luke's dad's
Christmas party?

12:18.821 --> 12:20.573
Like you even have to ask.
Come on.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.574
(giggles)

12:22.951 --> 12:23.993
(sighs)

12:30.333 --> 12:32.502
I have never seen you
look so happy.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.295
(inhales sharply)
I don't know.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.880
Ever since I got
the scholarship,

12:35.880 --> 12:38.299
I feel like this 5,000-pound
weight has been lifted off me.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.468
I'm so happy for you.
Seriously.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.678
Megan:
Thanks.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.554
So...

12:43.554 --> 12:45.473
there's this thing that
I've always wanted to do.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.101
-Mm-hmm.
-But I've always been
too scared and too practical.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.186
-And too much
of a rule follower?
-Yes, maybe.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.272
-Isabella: Mm-hmm.
-(both giggle)

12:52.272 --> 12:54.983
Well, lucky that I came along
and corrupted you.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.318
I know, you keep telling me.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.779
But I think that,
now that the pressure's off,

12:59.779 --> 13:01.948
I want to do it.
With you.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.658
Like, right now.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.160
-I'm in.
-Okay.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.705
(tea kettle whistling)

13:11.374 --> 13:13.251
Lily: It's just ten dollars
for the movies.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.752
What's your problem?

13:14.752 --> 13:16.713
What did you do with
all your babysitting money?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.256
Debbie:
Just give it to her.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.633
It's bad enough they cancelled
the Ocean Bloom.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.509
Let her have some fun.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.683
Change your shirt.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.311
-(softly) You're such a beyatch.
-And you look slutty.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.813
Rather look like a slut than
have everyone think I'm a freak.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.897
Do you want the money or not?

13:40.028 --> 13:41.904
You don't have to be
so hard on her.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.575
I'm trying to protect her.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.410
If she gets a reputation now,
she'll never shake it.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.837
She's thousands of miles
from home.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.339
She's probably just
as nervous as you are.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.800
(scoffs) That girl hasn't been
nervous a day in her life.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.052
She was born cool.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.970
Oh, give her a chance.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.930
Well, I'm not changing
my routine for her.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.100
I have to go by the restaurant,
get new cables for my computer,
get gas.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.769
Boring, normal, everyday stuff.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.937
And then I'm gonna meet Luke
at the Bloom.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.023
-Take her with you.
-Mom...

14:17.023 --> 14:18.775
I told her you'd show her
around town.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.027
-It'll be fun.
-(floorboard squeaks)

14:22.737 --> 14:23.738
Ready to go?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.581
(relaxing rock ballad playing)

14:38.711 --> 14:41.714
Megan: So what, uh,
what made you pick Chatham
of all places?

14:41.714 --> 14:45.468
Oh, I've never, like, spent
any real time in the U. S.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.554
And your mom's letter
was so lovely, so...

14:48.554 --> 14:50.807
made me feel like
I would be really welcome here.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.230
I wanted to come
to a small town,

14:57.230 --> 15:00.817
you know, be a part
of a family, a community.

15:00.817 --> 15:04.195
Have that normal
American high-school experience
that I've always seen in movies.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.990
Well, I hope
you're not disappointed.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.700
Nothing too exciting
happens here.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.286
It looks so pretty.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.122
Like out of a postcard.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.873
Megan:
A very small postcard.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.584
Where everyone knows everything
about everybody else.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.211
That can be nice though, right?

15:20.211 --> 15:22.213
Except when you do something
stupid in fourth grade

15:22.213 --> 15:24.382
and people remind you about it
for the rest of your life.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.017
♪ There's nothing wrong
with me ♪

15:37.562 --> 15:39.105
What are you up to?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.940
I thought that you
were afraid of heights.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.567
I used to be afraid
of a lot of things.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.657
To the best friend
I could ever ask for,

15:49.657 --> 15:51.659
my ultimate "ride or die."

15:51.659 --> 15:53.911
You helped me see things
in myself

15:53.911 --> 15:56.080
that I never believed
were there.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.248
I never want you to leave.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.127
(giggling)

16:01.127 --> 16:02.086
Let's do this.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.979
It's really cold.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.439
That's the whole point.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.649
Anybody can do this
in the summer.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.234
Ride or die.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.572
Ride or die.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.368
-Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.079
One, two, three...

16:57.308 --> 16:59.018
(bell clanging)

16:59.018 --> 17:01.103
(pop music on car radio)

17:09.237 --> 17:10.655
(music stops)

17:24.835 --> 17:26.837
(sirens wailing)

17:29.048 --> 17:30.883
(sirens fading)

17:46.107 --> 17:49.652
Parker:
None of this would've happened
if she never came to town.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.487
I think about that all the time.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.886
Hey, Megan.
And hello, Megan's friend.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.138
-Isabella.
-Hey.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.806
Is that a Manhattan?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.309
-Yeah. Good eye.
-My dad drinks those.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.061
I like to steal the cherries
after they've soaked up
some of the whiskey.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.857
-Really? Do you?
-Mm-hmm.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.734
Uh, do you have my check?

18:29.734 --> 18:33.696
Yeah, uh... Kim's gonna take
your shifts this weekend.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.698
And you'll work her Monday
and Tuesday.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.701
-But I'll make,
like, half the money.
-It all evens out in the end.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.871
Except it doesn't.
I need that money
for my college applications.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.624
You're just giving her
the best shifts because
she flirts with you.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.293
Jerry: Well, it's not my fault
if she finds me irresistible.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.669
Do we got a problem?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.592
Nope.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.179
Bye.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.438
Isabella: Where do you want
to go to college?

19:07.438 --> 19:10.232
Uh... University of Washington--
U Dub.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.817
They have this one scholarship,

19:11.817 --> 19:14.362
it's a full ride
for computer science majors.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.530
Computer science? Wow.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.991
God, I'm, like,
so bad with numbers.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.868
They've always come
really easily to me.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.373
Uh, what about you?
What are you into?

19:25.373 --> 19:27.792
Oh, uh, school's
never really been my thing.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.210
I'm more a student of life.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.389
-Well, there's
my Gates Scholar.
-(Megan giggles)

19:41.389 --> 19:43.599
You must be walking on air.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.435
I could barely sleep.
I'm so excited.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.937
I can't believe it's real.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.314
I'm so proud of you, baby.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.108
The first Landry woman
to go to college.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.402
You're gonna run
the world one day.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.696
-Thanks.
-I wish I had your drive.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.115
Your focus.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.658
You've done so great.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.493
I never could have done
any of this without you.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.334
Hey, just so you know,

20:10.334 --> 20:12.420
I'm still gonna have
a job while I'm at school,

20:12.420 --> 20:14.046
-so I'll be able
to help out.
-No.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.132
I want you to enjoy college.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.551
Take your foot off the gas
a little, let loose.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.177
Let me be the adult
for a change.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.889
Okay.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.100
Speaking of...

20:26.100 --> 20:27.768
I will see you later.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.104
Oh, wait.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.317
-(sighs) Thanks.
-Yeah.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.116
I'm really excited to be
in one place for a change.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.784
Really explore it.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.121
Yeah, well, you can basically
see all of Chatham in one day.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.166
There's not a lot to discover.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.793
My friend Luke, his dad
owns most of the businesses
around here,

20:52.793 --> 20:54.712
so if you're not
working for him,

20:54.712 --> 20:57.923
then there's no real future,
aside from waiting tables.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.925
That's why I'm
trying to get out.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.761
Isabella:
Where would you go?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.137
Megan:
Um...

21:03.137 --> 21:04.221
-After college?
-Yeah.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.639
Silicon Valley.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.433
That's where all
the opportunities are.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.810
Work for Apple or Yahoo!
or maybe a start-up.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.858
Here's the thing
about this town,

21:15.858 --> 21:18.986
just keep your expectations low
and you'll be less disappointed.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.864
Don't worry, I'm all about
living in the now.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.324
That sounds horrible.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.367
Actually,
it's pretty liberating.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.911
You should try it.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.378
You've got lots of time
to figure out what you want
to do with your life.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.130
That's what these years
are all about.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.466
Yeah, my dad doesn't
really see it that way.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.009
He's a reasonable guy.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.011
Just keep talking to him,
he'll come around.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.306
Megan:
Luke!

21:49.642 --> 21:50.935
Luke:
Hey.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.103
Jack: Hey, Megan,
how's your summer going?

21:53.103 --> 21:55.898
Uh, it's...
a little complicated.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.608
Sounds intriguing.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.068
But I'm sure it's nothing
you can't handle.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.281
-Have fun at the Bloom.
-Yeah. See ya.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.076
Hey, so it must be going well,
you haven't thrown her
into the lake yet.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.329
Not really.
We kind of had a run-in earlier.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.998
What, did she catch you going
through her stuff or something?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.917
Kind of.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.460
Megan, I was kidding.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.878
I wish I was.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.549
You must be Isabella.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.051
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm-- I'm Luke.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.138
Um, did you just get arrested?

22:28.138 --> 22:30.140
No, no, sorry.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.935
I'm doing this high school
law enforcement thing.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.105
It's dumb, but my dad thinks
it builds character, so...

22:36.105 --> 22:38.357
Does it?

22:38.357 --> 22:42.319
Well, drunk tourists have
some very educational stories.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.322
Having been one,
I couldn't agree more. (laughs)

22:45.322 --> 22:48.158
Well, there's nothing wrong
with the occasional vice.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.828
Unless it's an empty stomach
and a Zodiac full of Zima.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.083
Anyways... has Megs given you
the 411 on the Bloom tonight?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.334
Hm-mm.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.919
Oh, um, every July,

22:58.919 --> 23:01.380
there's bioluminescence
in the water for a couple days.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.509
Yeah, so of course this town
turned the cool natural wonder

23:05.509 --> 23:08.679
into an opportunity to sell
snow cones and glow sticks.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.348
Sounds fun. I can't wait.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.984
man:
Thank you.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.153
Hey, Megan.
Picking up for your mom?

23:24.153 --> 23:25.070
Mm-hmm.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.782
Main Street was all backed up.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.950
Big ruckus on the water.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.493
woman:
What's going on?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.537
man: Fisherman found
a body in the lake.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.247
-woman: They
know who it is?
-man: Not yet.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.082
Coast Guard's
on the way out there.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.876
-Here we go.
-Thanks.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.291
(door clatters)

24:19.291 --> 24:20.834
(Megan panting)

24:42.690 --> 24:44.274
Well, I'm excited for you,

24:44.274 --> 24:46.652
and I'll have it for you
by the end of the day.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.903
Thanks, hon.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.405
-I will.
-(knock on door)

24:49.405 --> 24:51.073
All right, bye-bye.
Come in.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.491
Oh, hey.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.575
Hi.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.579
I ran the numbers
on that Northland project.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.624
-And?
-It's a big swing.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.209
Sure you want to take on
that kind of risk?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.502
You think it's a mistake?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.295
No. Just a high flyer.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.839
Well, it is.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.091
And I appreciate the caution,
but I am moving on this.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.509
I mean...

25:10.509 --> 25:12.928
from my experience,
Northland is the kind of deal

25:12.928 --> 25:14.972
that could have
a real impact on the town.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.640
Right? It brings in business
all year round,

25:16.640 --> 25:18.183
it puts Chatham on the map.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.272
Debbie:
Luke was at the house earlier.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.149
Can you believe
they're going to be seniors?

25:25.149 --> 25:27.484
Oh, I feel like they were
in kindergarten yesterday.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.404
Time flies, huh?

25:30.404 --> 25:33.240
Lining up investors already.
Lots of interest.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.867
The congressman's on line one.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.493
Thank you.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.497
Joe, buddy.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.292
You still licking your wounds
from that ass-kicking
I put on you last week?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.837
Oh, yeah, rematch
any time, any place.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.631
Tell me when,
I'll be on the first tee
waiting for you, sir.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.385
(sighs) Sorry.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.970
Um...

25:54.970 --> 25:57.306
the Northland investors
are starting to get cold feet.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.183
Can you find new investors?

25:59.183 --> 26:01.602
Yeah, but that takes time
and we're already losing

26:01.602 --> 26:04.063
so much summer foot traffic
to Pine Cove.

26:04.063 --> 26:09.234
Northland was going to recoup
all of it, maybe more.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.905
Have you tried hitting them
with a full blast
of the Chambers charm?

26:15.741 --> 26:17.117
I think that's gone.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.702
(scoffs) Hardly.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.537
Most of the women in this town

26:20.537 --> 26:23.248
would ditch their husbands
if you looked at them twice.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.416
Oh, yeah?

26:26.668 --> 26:27.669
Yeah.

26:41.892 --> 26:45.729
So, anyway,
that's my long-winded story.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.439
(laughs) Well,
it was very entertaining.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.649
Hope I didn't bore you.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.400
No, I loved it.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.487
Oh, guys, everyone. Hi.
This is Isabella.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.114
She's visiting
for the year from...

26:55.114 --> 26:56.782
-Uh, France,
most recently.
-France.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.159
-Bonjour.
-Seriously?

26:59.159 --> 27:01.537
Well, I'm just trying
to make her feel more at home.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.872
It's actually not the worst
French accent I've heard.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.374
This charmer is
my brother Brent.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.668
And that's Parker,
Kellie, and Amy.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.503
-Hey!
-Hey!

27:09.503 --> 27:11.255
-Hi.
-Oh, my God.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.840
I need a drink.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.883
Great shirt.
It's like very Gwen.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.262
Oh. Um... thanks.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.305
How do you say "You're hot"
in your language?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.057
You mean in English?

27:22.057 --> 27:23.517
Or do you want me
to translate it

27:23.517 --> 27:25.185
into whatever it is
that you speak?

27:25.185 --> 27:27.646
Okay, you're done, you're done.
You're cut off, you're cut off.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.690
-(girls giggling)
-I'm Jeff.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.358
Nice to meet you.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.026
Hi.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.696
Oh, cool.
Are you making a documentary?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.865
More like cinema verité.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.992
-Nice.
-Jeff: You lucked out.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.328
You couldn't ask for
a better host than Megan.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.706
(indistinct chatter)

27:45.706 --> 27:49.418
(overlapping dialogue)

28:03.223 --> 28:05.058
Ah, I wish we were going
to the same college.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.436
We're only gonna be
an hour apart, we'll see
each other every weekend.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.271
-What if I can't
wait that long?
-(laughs)

28:10.856 --> 28:13.650
-(gunshot)
-What was that?

28:13.650 --> 28:16.737
(gunshot)

28:16.737 --> 28:19.615
(gunshot, crows cawing)

28:23.076 --> 28:24.328
That guy's a stone cold freak.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.704
(gunshot)

28:25.704 --> 28:28.123
That freak was
employee number 12 at Apple.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.250
He's coder royalty,
worth millions.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.753
-(gunshot)
-I heard him going on
at the hardware store

28:32.753 --> 28:35.339
about how the world's
gonna end on Y2K.

28:35.339 --> 28:38.342
What's he gonna do if it
comes and nothing happens?

28:38.342 --> 28:40.052
Let's go inside.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.848
(crows cawing)

28:50.395 --> 28:52.022
(intense electronic music
playing)

28:52.022 --> 28:54.650
(horns blaring)

29:03.784 --> 29:05.744
(sirens wailing)

29:23.720 --> 29:25.931
Uh, yeah, about four years.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.766
But we-we'll get
into that next week.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.393
Okay? See ya.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.939
You look beautiful.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.315
Ah!

29:35.315 --> 29:37.317
You're pretty dashing yourself.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.446
I like the shoes.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.824
Oh! Well,
you have excellent taste.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.412
You've outdone yourself.

29:48.412 --> 29:51.206
Well, uh, Wayne Bright
and some of the Northland
investors are coming.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.459
I thought...
pull out all the stops. Yep?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.336
They should be very impressed.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.842
They're adorable.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.844
Steve:
Puppy love.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.595
Oh, I don't know.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.807
I think it may run
deeper than that.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.143
Steve:
Yeah, I mean...

30:11.143 --> 30:13.186
they have their whole futures
ahead of them,

30:13.186 --> 30:16.148
a little too young
to get tied down.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.526
Here's Wayne now.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.570
-Want to help me
close this?
-Debbie: You bet.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.905
-Glad you could make it.
-Debbie: It's nice
to finally meet you.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.907
-Hey, hey!
-Happy holidays.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.784
-What's up?
-Hi, Jeff.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.369
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.371
-Luke: Thank you.
-Okay.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.540
Uh, the bartender,
he goes to school with Brent,

30:33.540 --> 30:34.666
so he's really cool.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.334
And he's smoking hot.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.341
-Hi.
-(seductively) Hi!

30:43.341 --> 30:45.385
Oh, that guy
does not stand a chance.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.346
No. She's pretty irresistible
when she wants something.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.140
Sounds like someone else I know.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.308
(Megan sighs)

30:51.308 --> 30:53.935
(pop ballad in background)

31:00.567 --> 31:02.360
(teens chatting in distance)

31:06.823 --> 31:10.160
Isabella: Wow.
That doesn't even look real.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.830
Megan: It only lasts for,
like, three days,
so enjoy it while you can.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.624
Luke's cute.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.334
How long have
you two been dating?

31:17.334 --> 31:18.960
(laughs) Ah...

31:18.960 --> 31:21.505
it's... it's not like that.

31:21.505 --> 31:24.966
I've known him my whole life,
he's practically my brother.

31:24.966 --> 31:28.053
Oh. Okay, I thought that
there was, like, a vibe
or something going on,

31:28.053 --> 31:29.137
but I didn't...

31:29.137 --> 31:30.472
You thought wrong.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.515
(giggles)

31:31.515 --> 31:33.892
-Guys.
-Hey, what's up?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.185
Hey, you guys made it.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.978
-Hey!
-Do you want some?

31:36.978 --> 31:38.230
Uh, sure.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.819
(friends laughing)

31:43.819 --> 31:45.779
-Oh, I'm good.
-Wait, you don't drink?

31:45.779 --> 31:47.489
-Hm-mm, no.
-Like ever?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.533
both:
Never!

31:49.533 --> 31:52.619
No, trust me, I've tried
to corrupt her many times,
but she's just...

31:52.619 --> 31:54.412
too much of a control freak.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.873
Yeah, and your drunk ass loves
having a designated driver.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.209
(friends laughing)

31:59.209 --> 32:01.211
So true. Please, thank you.

32:01.211 --> 32:03.338
(friends laughing)

32:03.338 --> 32:05.549
(coughing)

32:08.718 --> 32:10.679
Principal Bowers,
it's so good to see you.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.764
Your dad was just telling me
how excited you are

32:12.764 --> 32:15.183
to be following
in his and Brent's
footsteps at Branson.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.979
It's the Chambers way.

32:18.979 --> 32:22.232
Branson has
a great business program
and he'll love it.

32:24.526 --> 32:28.071
Sorry to interrupt.
I need to steal you two.
Judge Fallon wants to say hi.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.197
Okay.

32:31.449 --> 32:34.119
(sighs) Every time
I hear "business program,"

32:34.119 --> 32:36.746
I want to eat a gun.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.832
Have you tried
telling your dad that?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.333
(scoffs) Are you kidding?

32:40.333 --> 32:42.210
His head would explode
into, like, a million pieces.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.920
I know.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.132
Well, if you ever want to try,
you know I'll have your back.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.258
I love you.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.020
I love you too.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.484
Mike the bartender may be
the dumbest person
I've ever met.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.111
Including Freddy.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.531
Well, is he hot enough
that you don't care?

33:11.531 --> 33:13.074
I think so. Yeah.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.701
You girls are ice cold.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.578
Oh, come on,
guys are just as bad.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.580
-We're just honest
about it.
-Mm-hmm.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.585
(Luke gasping)

33:23.585 --> 33:25.670
-Hey!
-Hey.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.131
Oh! Man.

33:28.131 --> 33:31.551
You were so worried that you
were gonna have to babysit her,
but she's doing fine.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.305
You... have to admit,
she's kinda great.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.684
Is she?

33:42.312 --> 33:44.898
You know, you're not the best
at letting people in.

33:47.317 --> 33:51.238
Okay, fine, maybe there's
nothing objectively
wrong with her.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.323
Yeah? But?

33:53.323 --> 33:55.867
I just don't see us
ever being friends.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.877
♪ She'll make you
take your clothes off ♪

34:05.877 --> 34:08.964
♪ And go dancing

34:08.964 --> 34:11.591

34:39.035 --> 34:41.246
You and Luke, like,
really aren't a thing?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.832
Nope.

34:43.832 --> 34:46.876
So you would be okay
if I hooked up with him?

34:48.586 --> 34:51.339
Uh, n-- yeah, no, go for it.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.300
Cool.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.468
I mean, he may not
even be interested, but...

35:02.809 --> 35:04.561
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.896
(indistinct chatter)

35:20.785 --> 35:23.663
Freddy! Freddy,
why would you do that?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.633
(contemplative music playing)

35:41.431 --> 35:42.932
(indistinct chatter)

35:54.694 --> 35:56.404
(distant siren wailing)

36:05.789 --> 36:07.582
(police radio in background)

36:50.333 --> 36:52.335
I'm sorry, um...

36:52.335 --> 36:53.753
about before.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.338
Going through your stuff.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.631
That wasn't cool.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.055
Good night.

37:15.275 --> 37:18.236
(orchestra playing
"Jingle Bells"
over sound system)

37:19.779 --> 37:21.239
-Can I...?
-(music stops)

37:21.239 --> 37:23.074
Thank you all for coming.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.076
When my late wife Jane and I

37:25.076 --> 37:27.370
first started
throwing these parties,

37:27.370 --> 37:30.331
our boys, Brent and Luke,
were babies.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.792
(clicks tongue)
Uh, the first year it was

37:32.792 --> 37:36.129
just a handful of close friends
and, you know, some pizzas.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.715
Things have changed
a little bit since then.

37:38.715 --> 37:42.177
Um, Brent is now at Branson,

37:42.177 --> 37:47.182
and Luke is following
in his footsteps this fall.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.808
Couldn't be
more proud of you.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.729
And we all couldn't
be more excited

37:52.729 --> 37:56.483
to share this evening
with all of you.

37:56.483 --> 38:00.069
So, tradition dictates that
we'll show a Christmas movie.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.573
This year's selection
was Jane's favorite,

38:03.573 --> 38:06.493
and it's one
that holds a special place
in my heart as well.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.245
So, please get another drink,
get some food,

38:09.245 --> 38:10.955
and enjoy.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.417
Uh... merry Christmas.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.253
-(subdued cheering)
-man: Hear, hear!

38:17.253 --> 38:20.089
-woman 1: Merry Christmas!
-woman 2: Happy holidays.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.675
-Nicely done.
-Yeah, well, thank you.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.928
Want to head inside?

38:24.928 --> 38:26.846
-Yeah, I do.
-(static from film)

38:26.846 --> 38:30.183
(shocked murmurs)

38:30.183 --> 38:35.355
(panting on film)

38:35.355 --> 38:37.190
What the hell is this?

38:37.190 --> 38:39.150
(panting continues)

38:39.150 --> 38:41.569
Someone turn off the tape.
Someone turn it off!

38:41.569 --> 38:44.072
-man: Turn it off!
-woman: Is that
Isabella's sweater?

38:44.072 --> 38:46.741
girl:
That's totally Isabella!

38:46.741 --> 38:49.410
-(shocked murmurs)
-(girl in film panting)

38:54.207 --> 38:55.542
Luke! Turn it off!

39:05.343 --> 39:06.886
(softly)
Some best friend you are.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.522
Isabella:
Megan, please!

39:17.522 --> 39:19.566
Megan, wait! Megan!
Megan, listen to me!

39:19.566 --> 39:20.567
Let go of me!

40:11.701 --> 40:13.828
-Don't need to-- Steve!
-Jack, Jack!

40:19.792 --> 40:20.960
It's Luke.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.632
It's Luke.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.263
(zipper closes)

40:56.037 --> 40:57.580
We have to get
our story straight.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.544
(high-pitched tone droning,
growing louder)

41:15.598 --> 41:18.393
(theme song playing)
