01:52.412 --> 01:55.677
If I had to pick a beginning
to this bizarre story,

01:55.748 --> 01:57.682
I guess it would have to be the dream.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.615
Yeah, definitely the dream.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.313
That's when it all started.

02:01.387 --> 02:04.879
That's me, Jeremy Capello,
sitting inside the tuba.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.086
If I appear disoriented, it's because
I don't know how to play a tuba

02:08.161 --> 02:10.356
or any other musical instrument.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.456
I'm not in the band.
That's Candy Andrews.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.299
She's a cheerleader.
I think she likes me.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.930
But for some unknown reason,
I can't keep my eyes

02:20.006 --> 02:22.804
off Darla Blake, musical prodigy.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.639
Juilliard candidate perhaps,

02:24.711 --> 02:27.544
but not what you would call
centerfold material.

02:27.614 --> 02:33.450
In fact, Darla Blake is not someone
you would call, period.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.715
Then comes the note.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.053
I can't believe it, but I'm fascinated.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.588
"Follow me."

02:46.833 --> 02:49.961
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.465
So I went for it.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.769
Suddenly, I'm in the girls' locker room,

02:59.846 --> 03:02.940
no man's land, the forbidden zone.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.711
I'd heard the horror stories.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.547
Men caught in here were castrated

03:06.619 --> 03:09.452
and made to pass out towels for eternity.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.922
A living hell I could do without.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.086
And then I see her.

03:16.162 --> 03:18.027
She's gorgeous.

03:18.097 --> 03:20.622
Is this the same Darla Blake?

03:20.700 --> 03:24.864
Without being too obvious,
I check out her birthday suit.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.099
She asks me to take a shower with her.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.438
I tell her I'm clean, but she insists.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.375
"Make love to me," she says.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.777
I tell her, "We're moving too fast."

03:34.847 --> 03:36.838
I offer to take her to lunch instead.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.316
L... l...

03:39.385 --> 03:41.910
Suddenly, there's a new babe in my arms.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.752
I'm shocked. I excuse myself
and ask, "Where's Darla?"

03:44.824 --> 03:46.485
She tells me to kiss her.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.426
I say, "Whose dream is this anyway?
I'm looking for Darla."

03:49.495 --> 03:50.792
She tells me to kiss her again.

03:50.863 --> 03:53.593
I refuse. Then things get ugly.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.974
Throw him down!

04:27.166 --> 04:29.157
All units, 7 A85.

04:29.235 --> 04:32.500
Code 6 on Kirby and Westheimer.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.972
7X23. Roger on your Code 6.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.032
Louis, call your son.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.704
- His eggs are ready.
- Jeremy.

04:43.182 --> 04:44.444
Morning.

04:44.517 --> 04:45.950
Morning.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.511
Morning. Morning, Dad.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.258
Mom, I've got a problem.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.021
What's your problem, Jeremy?

04:55.094 --> 04:58.063
Honest to God, I cannot remember
what Dad looks like.

04:59.265 --> 05:02.234
Well, he's still a very handsome man.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.430
Dad, you're bald.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.601
Morning, Mrs. Capello, Mr. Capello.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.647
- Morning, Ralph.
- Sorry I can't stay for breakfast, but...

05:14.714 --> 05:16.409
- We're running late, as usual.
- As usual.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.074
Ralph's right. We have to go.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.483
Ralph, there's a speed trap
over at the Montrose off-ramp.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.713
Thanks, Mrs. Capello.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.082
Drive carefully, boys.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.319
We always do.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.964
The same dream, fourth night in a row.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.500
Darla Blake.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.763
How can you totally ignore Candy Andrews,

05:37.837 --> 05:40.772
who, by the way, is hot after your tailpipe,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.968
then have perverted dreams
about frigid and rigid Blake?

05:44.043 --> 05:46.068
- It's not perverted.
- You're right.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.737
It's not perverted, it's bizarre.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.078
Okay, but what does it mean?

05:50.149 --> 05:53.277
If you're crazy enough to waste
a perfectly good wet dream on Darla Blake,

05:53.353 --> 05:54.684
you need professional help.

05:54.754 --> 05:55.880
You don't understand.

05:55.955 --> 06:00.085
I see a side to this girl
that nobody knows exists.

06:00.159 --> 06:03.219
I have a theory about this dream of yours.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.196
Okay, when was the last time you got laid?

06:05.264 --> 06:06.891
What does that have to do with anything?

06:06.966 --> 06:08.194
Can't you remember?

06:08.267 --> 06:11.566
Not that it's any of your damn business,
but Peterson's party.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.036
Jenny Cicero in the closet, remember?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.300
Oh, no! Yeah, I remember.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.605
You bought her a dozen roses
and invited her home to meet your parents.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.440
- What is that?
- She's a nice girl.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.481
No, you're confusing true love
with common household guilt.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.039
What you need
is an incredible sexual encounter

06:25.118 --> 06:28.246
with no strings attached,
no emotional involvements,

06:28.321 --> 06:31.119
just pure, unadulterated lust.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.215
- That's not me.
- It could be.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.590
I mean, a carefree,
fun-Ioving romp in the sack

06:35.661 --> 06:37.094
with but a single purpose...

06:37.163 --> 06:39.393
to use and degrade another human being

06:39.465 --> 06:41.399
to satisfy your own selfish pleasures.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.059
Sorry. Not interested.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.400
Sex without guilt is the greatest.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.564
Hi, Pam.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.574
But pick a girl who doesn't go
to this school.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.288
- Hi, Flo.
- Hi, Jeremy.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.026
- He's in the back.
- Thanks.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.597
Hiya, George.
How many today?

07:54.674 --> 07:57.472
Oh, the usual.
A dozen or so.

07:57.543 --> 08:00.410
George, what would
all these old ladies do without me?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.175
Probably die of constipation.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.016
Yeah.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.710
You know, just once,
I wish I could make a delivery

08:08.788 --> 08:10.688
to someone who still had all their teeth.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.485
Got a new one for you today.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.048
Oh, yeah?

08:14.126 --> 08:15.787
Highline Drive?

08:15.862 --> 08:17.523
You're sure about this address, George?

08:17.597 --> 08:19.224
That's the address she gave.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.095
This is the old Gardner mansion.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.897
It's been deserted for years.
It's a dump.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.699
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.001
No PoliGrip. No Geritol.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.439
No Deep Heating Rub?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.876
George, we may be on to something here.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.587
This has got to be a joke.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.070
Come in.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.442
Hello!

09:14.020 --> 09:15.681
Groceries!

09:16.689 --> 09:18.350
Hello!

09:26.098 --> 09:27.429
Hello?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.195
Hey!

09:29.268 --> 09:31.031
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Hi.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.966
Where is everybody, huh?

09:36.042 --> 09:37.737
This comes to 13.49.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.278
I can take a check, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to see some ID.

09:45.985 --> 09:46.974
Are you hurt?

09:49.722 --> 09:53.988
I'm afraid Nora's a bit nervous
around strangers.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.460
Is anything the matter?

09:57.530 --> 09:59.464
No...

09:59.532 --> 10:01.932
I just thought you were somebody else.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.969
Have we met before?

10:04.036 --> 10:05.628
I'm not sure.

10:05.705 --> 10:09.607
You're bleeding.
I feel responsible.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.972
Let me see.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.102
It's really just... just a scratch.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.477
When I was little and scratched my finger,

10:16.549 --> 10:18.949
my mother would always kiss it.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.223
My mother used Band-Aids.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.852
I've got one in the car.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.953
How's that? Better?

10:31.030 --> 10:33.123
Much better.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.636
I have to go.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.295
- Jeremy?
- Yes?

10:39.372 --> 10:42.034
- Do you find me attractive?
- Very.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.303
I have to go.
More deliveries, you know?

10:44.377 --> 10:45.901
I like you, Jeremy.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.605
Can you come back later?

10:47.680 --> 10:50.376
You want me to come back?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.643
How about tonight?

10:51.717 --> 10:55.346
I really, really have to go.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.321
Around midnight?

10:57.390 --> 10:58.550
I'm a night owl.

10:58.624 --> 11:01.218
Night owl.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.129
She sucked your what?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.327
My finger, you jerk!

11:12.805 --> 11:14.363
My finger!

11:14.440 --> 11:16.931
He lets her get away.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.102
Ralph, there's something
very weird about this woman.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.043
She's the woman in my dreams.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.876
Great. Then she's perfect.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.041
No! Ralph, she's not
the woman of my dreams,

11:25.117 --> 11:27.415
the woman in my dreams!

11:27.486 --> 11:29.784
- She knew my name.
- So what?

11:29.855 --> 11:32.289
I didn't tell her my name.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.724
Look, this is like an omen from God, okay?

11:34.794 --> 11:36.887
Look at it this way.
You like this woman, right?

11:36.962 --> 11:39.863
There's an attraction.
A sexual attraction.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.526
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Perfect.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.228
Is this someone you could
see being married to?

11:44.303 --> 11:45.793
- No.
- Perfect.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.202
What is the problem?

11:47.273 --> 11:49.605
- Let's go for it, man.
- No.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.734
I promise, nothing will go wrong.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.678
- I'll drive.
- It's a school night.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.908
Do it, nerd!

11:59.752 --> 12:01.379
I don't even know her name.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.388
Perfect.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.962
Well, she's still up, stud.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.999
You're absolutely certain
this will make me a better person?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.693
If nothing else, you'll sleep better.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.599
No more nightmares about Darla Blake.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.694
What if I was wrong?

12:18.771 --> 12:21.672
What if I misinterpreted
the entire situation?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.710
Jeremy, a beautiful woman
sucked your finger and begged for more.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.176
This is a date with destiny.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.611
Now get in there and enjoy it.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.615
All right. All right.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.882
How do I look?

12:33.953 --> 12:35.477
Like a vacuum cleaner salesman.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.911
No, I'm kidding.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.753
Relax. You look great.

12:39.825 --> 12:40.951
All right.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.389
Here goes nothing.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.453
Professor, shouldn't we warn him?

12:45.531 --> 12:48.022
No. Maybe he's one of them.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.091
But what if he isn't?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.376
Professor, what if he isn't one of them?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.844
Either way, it's too late now.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.744
Hello?

13:06.018 --> 13:07.679
Hello?

13:11.056 --> 13:12.216
It's me.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.852
Hello?

13:20.699 --> 13:21.859
Don't even think about it.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.302
Up there?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.163
Yeah?

13:29.608 --> 13:31.599
Why am I talking to a cat?

13:42.121 --> 13:43.179
Hello.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.063
Hello, Jeremy.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.434
I... The door was open.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.869
I called out, but...

13:59.939 --> 14:01.964
I've been expecting you.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.339
Oh, boy.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.607
Go ahead and look at me, Jeremy.
Don't be afraid.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.848
People said dreams don't come true.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.411
I'm glad you came.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.582
I want you to know

14:19.658 --> 14:22.923
that I'm usually not
this forward with women.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.212
Jeremy. Shit.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.871
What do I do?

14:54.927 --> 14:56.394
Jeremy.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.029
Jeremy!

15:01.133 --> 15:02.657
Hurry.

15:02.735 --> 15:07.434
You are the most intense,
gorgeous woman I ever met.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.838
I don't even know your name.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.241
Call me Nora.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.711
Nora?

15:14.780 --> 15:17.044
I thought that was your cat's name.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.777
Whatever.

15:32.164 --> 15:33.791
Did you hear something?

15:40.940 --> 15:44.467
You're not expecting anyone, are you?

15:55.487 --> 15:57.352
Stop this obscenity!

15:57.423 --> 15:59.948
- Oh, God!
- Get him.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.617
Oh, you...

16:01.694 --> 16:03.491
Hey, you!

16:03.562 --> 16:05.154
Hey! Stop!

16:10.369 --> 16:12.064
Hey! Hey!

16:12.137 --> 16:14.128
Quick! I knew it!

16:14.206 --> 16:15.673
Drive!

16:17.810 --> 16:19.573
- Where are your clothes?
- Screw my clothes!

16:19.645 --> 16:21.169
Let's get the hell out of here!

16:30.723 --> 16:32.816
Milton High School, huh?

16:32.891 --> 16:35.451
Well, we'll see.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.119
Professor!

16:38.263 --> 16:39.355
Professor!

16:46.739 --> 16:48.331
I knew it. I knew it.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.399
I'm having the most intense
sexual experience of my life,

16:51.477 --> 16:53.206
and some wild man kicks the door down.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.473
- Who was it?
- Her husband, boyfriend...

16:55.547 --> 16:56.775
How the hell am I supposed to know?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.373
- You didn't see anybody?
- No, man.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.782
I saw this white van, but what could I do?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.684
Look. Come on.
This isn't funny.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.382
I could've been killed.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.287
You know, maybe you should
stick to your dreams, man.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.519
You're just not ready for real life yet.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.787
All right, all right.

17:16.568 --> 17:19.162
Look, I'm sorry things
didn't work out, okay?

17:19.238 --> 17:21.604
We don't have to tell anybody about this.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.005
- No, of course not.
- Come on, l...

17:24.076 --> 17:26.067
This wasn't one
of my prouder moments, okay?

17:26.145 --> 17:28.841
- Hey, you're bleeding.
- What? Oh, my...

17:28.914 --> 17:30.381
Wow. It looks like bite marks.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.076
Hey, I am impressed.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.086
I told you, she was intense.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.849
- Damn.
- That's right.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.356
- Later, man.
- See you later.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.949
Watch your sheet.

17:59.511 --> 18:02.776
What now, Professor?

18:02.848 --> 18:05.373
First we finish here,

18:05.451 --> 18:08.284
then we locate the young man.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.849
What a night.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.361
Go!

18:39.384 --> 18:40.749
Wow.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.564
Hey. Hey. Hey.

19:19.124 --> 19:22.651
Jeremy, you haven't even
touched your breakfast.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.491
I'm not hungry.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.259
Louis, Jeremy won't eat his breakfast.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.259
- Eat.
- Do you feel all right?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.736
You look a little pale.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.864
I'm fine.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.568
I'm just tired.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.577
What'd you do to your neck?

19:39.645 --> 19:43.046
I cut myself shaving.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.242
Morning, Mrs. Capello, Mr. Capello.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.409
Morning, Ralph.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.783
- I think I'll stay home today.
- You better go on without him.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.378
I think he's caught something.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.959
I'm okay. Sort of.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.494
I'm just not hungry.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.620
Any speed traps today, Mrs. Capello?

19:59.698 --> 20:01.563
Lumkin Street and Fountain.

20:01.633 --> 20:05.330
Thanks. See you later, pal.

20:05.404 --> 20:06.803
Now, maybe if you'd eat something...

20:06.872 --> 20:08.464
Mom, please.
I'm not hungry.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.030
All right. Go ahead.
Starve yourself.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.405
See if I care.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.776
Hey.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.684
You don't feel warm.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.347
I don't get it.

20:25.424 --> 20:26.948
I have to go.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.694
But you're sick.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.771
Damn!

20:48.847 --> 20:51.338
Well done, Grimsdyke.
You managed to hit the wall.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.976
- Sorry, Professor.
- You think we're playing games here?

20:54.052 --> 20:56.782
The fate of the human race
is hanging in the balance.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.322
Sorry, Professor.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.291
If my calculations are correct,
and they always are,

21:01.360 --> 21:04.955
20 percent of the human race
will be infected by 1990.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.828
Within the next decade, we'll have lost
the entire North American continent,

21:07.899 --> 21:11.995
and by the year 2000,
vampire Armageddon.

21:13.372 --> 21:14.464
Damn!

21:14.539 --> 21:16.268
Luckily for us, there's still time

21:16.341 --> 21:19.572
while the threat
is still containable, localized.

21:19.645 --> 21:23.581
Someday we'll be revered
as heroes, you and I.

21:23.649 --> 21:28.416
Meantime, the teenager
in the red convertible must die.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.562
What about Casey Baldwin?
Would you do it with him?

21:44.636 --> 21:46.729
No way. I hate jocks.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.739
What about Matt Newberry?

21:48.807 --> 21:50.741
God, I get hot just mentioning his name!

21:50.809 --> 21:52.674
He's too status conscious.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.508
Darla, you wouldn't do it with anybody.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.172
- Well...
- Wait a minute.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.944
What about Tom Cruise?

21:59.017 --> 22:00.746
Okay, you can put him down as a "maybe."

22:00.819 --> 22:04.778
Are you just saying that
because he's not here?

22:04.856 --> 22:06.824
Hi, Jeremy.
I heard you were sick.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.484
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he had a bad night.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.255
Excuse us, please.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.728
Ralph, we have to talk.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.459
That girl's crazy about you, man.
I can't believe you don't go for her.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.728
- Not now, Ralph.
- Well, put in a good word for me.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.803
- Do you know anything about that guy?
- Why?

22:20.872 --> 22:22.897
Well, he keeps staring at me in algebra.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.908
That's Jeremy Capello.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.877
- Don't tell me you want him.
- Very funny, Gloria.

22:27.946 --> 22:30.813
- We are in deep shit.
- What are you talking about?

22:30.882 --> 22:33.749
Last night, after we left the Gardner place,
somebody torched it.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.878
- What?
- The police think it was arson.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.717
Don't you see? We were there.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.723
Yeah, but we didn't do anything.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.725
I mean, nobody even knows we were there...

22:41.793 --> 22:43.283
except the guy who busted in on you.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.386
Right. Exactly.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.454
What if he sets us up?

22:46.531 --> 22:48.192
Who's gonna believe
a couple of high school kids?

22:48.266 --> 22:50.393
Okay, look, let's calm down, okay?
Let's not panic.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.666
Ralph, I think someone's following me.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.138
What are you talking about? Who?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.072
I don't know. Some guy.

22:57.142 --> 22:58.871
Maybe a cop.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.912
Cops?

23:00.979 --> 23:03.038
Our lives are over.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.208
We're talking prison.

23:05.283 --> 23:08.150
We're talking homosexual rape
by convicts named Bruno.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.054
Hey, listen, we didn't do anything.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.592
- We got nothing to worry about, right?
- Right.

23:20.766 --> 23:21.858
There it is, Professor.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.901
That's the demon's car, remember?

23:23.969 --> 23:26.836
Be patient, my fat friend.
We'll get him.

23:28.306 --> 23:29.671
Park over there.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.380
Here. I can't drink this.

23:44.456 --> 23:47.186
I thought cherry was your favorite.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.920
Not today.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.255
That's him.

23:57.068 --> 23:58.535
Stay with him!

23:58.603 --> 24:00.594
Don't let him get away!

24:00.672 --> 24:02.799
Hey, hey, hey!

24:05.644 --> 24:07.874
Damn!

24:13.585 --> 24:15.780
Tell me that isn't the same
white van from last night.

24:15.854 --> 24:16.946
What?

24:17.022 --> 24:18.614
It's probably nothing to worry about, right?

24:22.928 --> 24:24.225
We're dead.

24:27.365 --> 24:28.889
See? Nothing.

24:28.967 --> 24:32.130
I wasn't really worried.
Just after last night...

24:32.204 --> 24:34.968
After last night, you're paranoid as hell.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.667
Damn right.

24:38.877 --> 24:41.471
- Shit!
- What?

24:41.546 --> 24:44.037
That's him, Nora's husband.

24:44.115 --> 24:46.948
Where'd your mom say
that speed trap was today?

24:47.018 --> 24:50.215
Lumkin Street and Fountain. Why?

24:50.288 --> 24:52.188
Hang on, man.
Here we go.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.700
Yeah!

25:24.322 --> 25:26.483
I am an animal!

25:45.443 --> 25:47.343
I knew it.

25:55.453 --> 25:58.445
- God, I'm sorry!
- You!

25:58.523 --> 26:00.218
Hi...

26:02.360 --> 26:03.793
Are you okay?

26:03.862 --> 26:05.762
Nothing's broken,
if that's what you mean.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.354
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

26:07.432 --> 26:09.764
How come you keep staring
at me in algebra?

26:09.834 --> 26:12.325
- I wasn't staring.
- Yes, you were.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.894
All right. I was staring.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.167
I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.303
Come on.

26:19.377 --> 26:21.072
- Come on.
- What?

26:21.146 --> 26:23.444
Go. Go!

26:23.515 --> 26:25.039
In here.

26:25.116 --> 26:26.777
You're very weird.
Do you know that?

26:26.851 --> 26:28.318
- Just get down.
- What?

26:28.386 --> 26:29.819
What? What?

26:29.888 --> 26:31.150
- There's someone following me.
- Who?

26:31.222 --> 26:32.621
I don't know.
I think he's a cop.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.124
Really? What did you do?

26:34.192 --> 26:35.750
Nothing. It's a long story.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.057
Jeremy, are you okay?

26:38.129 --> 26:39.790
Do me a favor.

26:39.864 --> 26:43.129
Look in that mirror up there
and tell me who you see.

26:43.201 --> 26:44.896
- No one.
- Okay, good.

26:44.970 --> 26:48.872
Look out that glass door
and tell me who you see.

26:51.176 --> 26:52.438
Nobody.

26:52.510 --> 26:53.602
Nobody?

26:55.146 --> 26:56.545
No, there was someone out there.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.048
There was this weird guy.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.981
Okay, that's it.

27:00.051 --> 27:02.884
This has really been enlightening,
but I'm needed back on Earth.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.649
Don't let him see you leave the cooler!

27:04.723 --> 27:05.883
No problem.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.755
I'm carrying a can of invisible hair spray.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.899
How you feeling, Jeremy?

27:24.976 --> 27:27.240
I'm okay. I'm just tired.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.746
Well, drink plenty of liquids.
That's the thing.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.476
Yeah. I think it's a protein deficiency.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.347
I'm making a protein shake.

27:34.419 --> 27:36.614
Your mom said a girl
named Candy called today.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.448
That's a great name.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.551
Candy. Sounds yummy.

27:43.628 --> 27:45.425
Yeah. She's a cheerleader.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.862
Blonde hair, all that stuff.

27:46.931 --> 27:48.091
Big deal.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.997
Women can really be a bother, can't they?

27:50.068 --> 27:52.468
Calling you all the time, wanting to go out.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.665
It's missing something.

27:55.740 --> 27:58.937
Well, it's been nice having this little
man-to-man chat with you, son.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.739
Night, Dad.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.260
Protein drink, huh?

29:17.288 --> 29:19.279
Wake up, Jeremy.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.517
Jeremy.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.221
We have to talk.

29:24.295 --> 29:25.489
Shit!

29:26.998 --> 29:29.125
I'm too young to go to jail.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.835
Permit me to introduce myself.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.065
I am Modoc, at your service.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.937
You mean you're not a cop?

29:37.008 --> 29:40.637
Jeremy, it has come to my attention
that you have recently had

29:40.712 --> 29:44.876
a sordid sexual encounter
with a strange and beautiful woman.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.940
It wasn't sordid.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.883
You were bitten by this woman,
were you not?

29:48.953 --> 29:51.046
That's none of your damn business!

29:51.122 --> 29:53.716
Jeremy, this woman was...

29:53.792 --> 29:56.784
how shall I say... infected.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.886
Oh, God.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.932
She looked so clean.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.865
It's all right.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.393
I'll cooperate, but please
don't tell my parents.

30:07.472 --> 30:12.739
I think I'm missing something
in the translation here.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.509
You're not from the health department.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.243
No.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.619
All right.
What is this all about?

30:29.694 --> 30:32.185
Have you experienced anything strange

30:32.263 --> 30:34.857
or unusual during the past 24 hours?

30:34.933 --> 30:36.560
Just you.

30:39.204 --> 30:40.193
How about them?

30:40.271 --> 30:42.296
A couple of stupid dogs.
Big deal.

30:42.373 --> 30:44.238
They know, Jeremy.

30:44.309 --> 30:47.676
When that woman bit you,
she transferred a legacy unto you...

30:47.745 --> 30:50.908
the legacy of a secret society
which has endured for centuries.

30:50.982 --> 30:52.506
You're not like other people anymore.

30:52.584 --> 30:53.778
Come on.
Who the hell are you?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.285
A new awareness is arising within you.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.581
New desires, even as we speak.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.019
- You can feel it, can't you?
- No!

30:58.089 --> 30:59.920
No longer will you tread with ordinary men.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.583
Get to the point!

31:03.094 --> 31:05.892
All right. All right.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.524
In a nutshell, you're alive,
but you're not alive.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.295
You're dead, but you're not dead.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.802
Did you ever hear the word "undead"?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.930
How about this one..."vampire"?

31:15.006 --> 31:18.407
I hope you've heard that one,
because that's what you are, okay?

31:18.476 --> 31:20.137
A vampire.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.340
I wanted to break it
to you nice and easy, but no.

31:24.415 --> 31:26.645
Everything with you young people
has to be fast, fast, fast.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.016
- Get out of here.
- I know. It's a shock.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.952
No one wants to believe
it can happen to them.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.512
- I'm not a vampire.
- What's going on?

31:32.590 --> 31:34.353
Honey?

31:34.425 --> 31:35.858
- Get out of here!
- Jeremy?

31:35.927 --> 31:37.155
Hi.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.855
I thought I heard you talking to somebody.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.398
No. It was the radio.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.934
No. It didn't sound like the radio.

31:44.002 --> 31:46.334
It sounded like a man's voice.

31:48.940 --> 31:51.067
Well, good night.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.507
You leave me alone.
Get out of here!

32:23.574 --> 32:24.563
I am not a vampire!

32:24.642 --> 32:26.974
And what makes you so sure?

32:27.045 --> 32:29.639
Vampires drink virgin blood, right?

32:29.714 --> 32:32.615
I'm not a virgin.
Ask Jenny Cicero.

32:32.684 --> 32:33.776
Louis?

32:33.851 --> 32:35.011
Come here.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.554
Haven't you noticed
your complexion turning pale?

32:37.622 --> 32:38.919
What about it?

32:38.990 --> 32:42.084
How about that uncomfortable glare
you're beginning to feel from the sun?

32:42.160 --> 32:43.627
I can explain that.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.255
- Your loss of appetite?
- Protein deficiency!

32:46.331 --> 32:47.958
How about your craving for raw meat?

32:48.032 --> 32:50.523
- More precisely, fresh blood?
- That's not true.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.262
Do you recognize this man?

32:53.972 --> 32:56.600
You are in grave danger, Jeremy.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.471
Wait, wait, wait. This...

32:58.543 --> 33:00.272
This guy's been following me.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.074
We need to talk.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.477
What?

33:03.548 --> 33:05.482
Who's that man?

33:06.551 --> 33:08.018
Get in the car.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.383
I don't know.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.149
He's not from the neighborhood.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.153
This man is Professor Leopold McCarthy,

33:17.228 --> 33:21.164
a noted historian by profession,
a ruthless murderer by choice.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.029
Together with his feeble-minded assistant,

33:23.101 --> 33:25.569
he's waged a war against
our kind for 20 years,

33:25.636 --> 33:29.265
and he will not rest until he has wiped
the last of us from the face of the earth.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.329
"Us"?

33:30.408 --> 33:34.105
- Vampires?
- Stop the car, freako.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.612
I'm here to help make the transition

33:36.681 --> 33:40.139
from your old life to your new life
as easy as possible.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.152
For the next few days,
I shall be your tutor

33:42.220 --> 33:44.586
and hopefully your friend.

33:44.655 --> 33:48.853
If you are a vampire,
how can you be out in the daylight?

33:48.926 --> 33:50.826
Undead vampires must remain in the dark.

33:50.895 --> 33:52.829
But you and I are living vampires.

33:52.897 --> 33:55.331
You will find that
and other useful information

33:55.400 --> 33:57.960
covered in this.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.765
"<i>Vampirism</i>.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.772
<i>A Practical Guide</i>
<i>to an Alternative Lifestyle</i>"?

34:02.840 --> 34:05.809
That is your Bible.
Read it, learn it, live it.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.004
- That's it.
- At least take this.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.344
What? What is this?

34:10.415 --> 34:12.178
That's the name of a reliable
all-night butcher.

34:13.351 --> 34:16.411
There's no getting around it, kid.
Vampires drink blood.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.114
We suggest pigs' blood, B-negative.

34:19.190 --> 34:23.456
I think you'll find it surprisingly
full-bodied with a smooth flavor.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.860
Just pull over and let me out, all right?

34:25.929 --> 34:27.726
All right, all right.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.232
Believe me, I know how you feel.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.326
But read your handbook,
get some sunglasses,

34:32.402 --> 34:34.530
and don't fret over drinking a little blood.

34:34.605 --> 34:37.505
Think of it as taking your vitamins.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.235
I am not a vampire!

34:39.310 --> 34:42.177
Well, I'll pop up from time to time
just to see how you're getting on.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.510
Don't bother, 'cause I never want
to see you again.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.708
And I'm not reading this book!

34:47.885 --> 34:50.217
And I'm not a vampire!

35:01.132 --> 35:02.827
I'm intrigued by her.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.834
There's definitely more to this girl
than meets the eye.

35:04.902 --> 35:08.235
Yeah, I hope so, for your sake.

35:08.306 --> 35:09.739
All right, Ralph.

35:09.807 --> 35:13.265
As much as I hate it,
it's your turn to drive.

35:13.344 --> 35:15.835
You're next, Capello.
In the back.

35:15.913 --> 35:19.440
This time, try and stay with him.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.485
I will, Professor.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.417
I warn you, any nonsense,

35:23.488 --> 35:26.389
and I'll make sure
your insurance skyrockets.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.485
Constant, gentle pressure
on the accelerator.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.654
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Turn left here.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.994
You failed to check your mirrors.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.359
Shit!

35:38.436 --> 35:40.131
- I beg your pardon.
- Shit!

35:40.204 --> 35:41.796
What the hell are you doing?

35:45.776 --> 35:48.074
- Yeah!
- Ralph, look out!

35:55.386 --> 35:57.286
Where are you going?

35:57.355 --> 36:00.290
Oh, my God, watch it!
Watch these people!

36:04.662 --> 36:06.527
"Endangering pedestrians."

36:10.067 --> 36:12.535
Look out!

36:12.603 --> 36:14.036
Easy, easy!

36:16.007 --> 36:19.374
- Watch that guy!
- Hey, look out!

36:19.443 --> 36:21.911
You will never drive in this town again.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.987
Grimsdyke.

36:34.058 --> 36:35.150
That's it!

36:35.226 --> 36:37.160
Fine. Let's bounce this bozo.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.458
Get back here, young man!

36:39.530 --> 36:42.431
Hey! You got a problem, pal?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.899
He's attacking!

36:47.171 --> 36:48.433
Oh, shit!

36:56.347 --> 36:57.609
Damn!

37:00.651 --> 37:03.119
- Ralph.
- I saw that!

37:03.187 --> 37:05.655
Your driving frightened
that man into an accident!

37:05.723 --> 37:07.714
More points!

37:07.792 --> 37:10.317
Hey! Come back here!

37:31.148 --> 37:32.638
Hi.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.015
You're staring at me again.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.852
Look, I'm really sorry about yesterday.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.686
I really made a jerk of myself.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.352
You know, you make me very nervous.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.725
I had a dream about you the other night.

37:45.796 --> 37:48.162
Are you gonna gross me out?

37:48.232 --> 37:50.166
No, it wasn't like that.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.833
Would you go out with me sometime?

37:57.341 --> 37:59.741
I don't know. Maybe.

37:59.810 --> 38:02.108
You let me slip through your fingers,
and you'll always regret it.

38:05.149 --> 38:07.947
Well, okay.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.146
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:10.221 --> 38:13.713
Great! I'll pick you up at 7:00.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.419
- Wait. Tonight?
- Why not?

38:18.462 --> 38:20.123
What did he want?

38:20.197 --> 38:23.030
Guess what.
I've got a date for tonight!

38:23.100 --> 38:24.761
Not with that geek.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.462
Darla, he's all wrong.

38:26.537 --> 38:29.165
Shut up, Gloria.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.765
He dreamed about me.

38:55.599 --> 38:56.861
The mirror's not working.

39:00.204 --> 39:02.695
Great. Great.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.885
Doesn't anything in this house work?

39:30.868 --> 39:33.564
- You must be Jeremy.
- We're so happy to see you.

39:33.637 --> 39:36.003
Don't block the doorway, Helen.
Let the boy come in.

39:36.073 --> 39:39.236
I'm Darla's father, Buddy Blake.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.902
You can call me Buddy.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.570
Okay, Buddy.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.773
- This is my wife Helen.
- Hi.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.476
You're a sharp-Iooking boy.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.518
Isn't he a sharp-Iooking boy, Buddy?

39:48.586 --> 39:50.520
He certainly is.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.751
Well, let's see if Darla's ready.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.959
Princess!

39:57.027 --> 39:58.722
Your escort is here!

39:58.796 --> 40:00.730
Coming!

40:00.798 --> 40:03.392
Would you like a drink, Jeremy?

40:03.467 --> 40:06.027
No. I'm driving.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.502
Of course. Good answer.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.973
There she is.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.135
Isn't she lovely?

40:14.211 --> 40:16.577
Come on, Mom. Cut it out.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.917
They make a really cute couple,
don't they, Helen?

40:23.988 --> 40:25.285
Just like us.

40:25.356 --> 40:26.482
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.286
Okay, kids.
Up against the wall.

40:28.359 --> 40:29.656
Mom!

40:29.727 --> 40:34.061
Come on now.
Don't spoil your father's fun.

40:34.131 --> 40:36.497
Ready now? Okay.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.228
Oh, wait. Wait.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.202
Helen, they're perfect.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.570
This is totally humiliating!

40:43.641 --> 40:46.906
Okay, big smiles now.

40:46.977 --> 40:47.966
One more.

40:48.045 --> 40:49.774
- One more for Grandma.
- Say "cheese."

40:51.348 --> 40:53.009
Look, we're late.
We've gotta go. Bye.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.017
Have a good time, Princess.

41:02.326 --> 41:04.760
I'm really sorry about that.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.888
Look, I understand.
Don't worry about it.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.432
I have parents, too.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.934
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

41:12.002 --> 41:13.993
Didn't they turn out?

41:16.740 --> 41:18.002
Piece of junk.

41:21.579 --> 41:24.480
Okay, you ordered one garbage can pizza,

41:24.548 --> 41:27.745
double on everything but anchovies.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.718
Thank you.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.812
But Ralph isn't really a jerk.

41:31.889 --> 41:35.120
He's... He's a good guy at heart.

41:35.192 --> 41:39.526
But he... he thinks that I should
only date gorgeous girls

41:39.597 --> 41:41.565
who have big...

41:42.800 --> 41:45.769
Big boobs and long, blonde hair

41:45.836 --> 41:48.737
- and beautifully suntanned skin and...
- Ditzy.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.866
When it comes to girls,
Ralph's only interested in one thing.

41:51.942 --> 41:53.170
You know.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.871
Yeah, I know.

41:54.945 --> 41:58.711
Ralph is... can be a jerk sometimes,

41:58.782 --> 42:01.080
but he's my best friend.

42:01.151 --> 42:04.484
And, what can I say?

42:04.555 --> 42:06.716
That's okay. I understand.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.350
Gloria doesn't exactly think
you're hot stuff, either.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.519
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:12.530 --> 42:16.125
Well, I'm glad they don't
pick our dates, I guess.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.669
Jeremy, are you okay?

42:21.972 --> 42:23.405
Yeah.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.807
I'm suddenly not hungry.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.504
You know, I heard you've been sick lately.

42:28.579 --> 42:31.514
- It's nothing, really.
- Well, maybe you have an allergy.

42:31.582 --> 42:34.779
Excuse me, but what's on this pizza?

42:34.852 --> 42:36.183
You ordered everything.

42:36.253 --> 42:37.618
That's pepperoni, sausage,

42:37.688 --> 42:40.987
tomatoes, mushrooms, onions,
olives, peppers and garlic.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.753
Garlic.

42:51.602 --> 42:52.728
That's his car.

42:52.803 --> 42:54.293
We've found him.

43:18.896 --> 43:20.386
Shit!

43:31.342 --> 43:33.776
It's a beautiful night.

43:33.844 --> 43:36.369
Yeah. I like the dark.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.610
I think I'm a night person.

43:39.683 --> 43:42.777
Jeremy, why did you ask me out?

43:44.021 --> 43:46.080
Well, I don't know.

43:46.156 --> 43:48.818
You see someone you like,
you wanna know them better,

43:48.892 --> 43:51.292
you ask them out.

43:51.362 --> 43:54.354
And because I wanna prove to you
I'm not the big jerk that you think I am.

43:54.431 --> 43:56.296
I don't think you're a big jerk.

43:56.367 --> 43:58.232
Gloria does, but I don't.

43:58.302 --> 43:59.792
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:59.870 --> 44:02.566
Well, Ralph thinks you're
a musical freak or something.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.006
Well, Gloria says you're...

44:05.075 --> 44:07.475
you're a repulsive, sickly slimeball.

44:07.544 --> 44:08.806
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:08.879 --> 44:10.608
Ralph says...

44:10.681 --> 44:12.308
Wait. That's his problem.

44:12.383 --> 44:15.477
I like you just the way you are.

44:15.552 --> 44:16.644
You're special.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.085
I am?

44:18.155 --> 44:19.782
Yeah.

44:28.098 --> 44:30.828
- Grimsdyke?
- Yes, sir?

44:30.901 --> 44:32.994
I think I'll go and lie down for a bit.

44:33.070 --> 44:35.300
Yes, Professor.
I'll take the first watch.

44:35.372 --> 44:39.570
Right. Call me if you
witness anything unusual.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.770
I will, Professor.

44:51.789 --> 44:53.450
Grimsdyke!

44:58.028 --> 45:02.089
Out. Now.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.396
Yes, Professor.

45:17.648 --> 45:18.808
Jeremy.

45:38.902 --> 45:41.564
Jeremy, what's wrong?
You're wheezing.

45:48.112 --> 45:49.636
Oh, no.

45:49.713 --> 45:52.511
Jeremy, what's wrong?
You're not sick, are you?

45:54.918 --> 45:56.476
I have to go.

45:56.553 --> 45:58.384
Jeremy, what's wrong?

45:58.455 --> 46:00.480
Where are you going? Stop!

46:00.557 --> 46:02.787
Wait! You can't do this!

46:02.860 --> 46:05.420
Stop! Please don't go!

46:05.496 --> 46:08.021
You can't leave me here.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.032
Come back!

46:10.100 --> 46:12.500
Wait!

46:12.569 --> 46:14.503
- Where are you going?
- Darla!

46:16.240 --> 46:18.572
What happened?

46:22.446 --> 46:23.879
Damn it!

46:23.947 --> 46:25.744
Jeremy Capello, you blew it!

46:35.025 --> 46:36.959
Find what you're looking for?

46:37.027 --> 46:39.587
Nah, the evil slime hasn't shown himse...

46:43.033 --> 46:44.625
Yes, he has.

46:44.701 --> 46:46.635
No!

46:46.703 --> 46:49.297
Who are you?
What do you want?

46:49.373 --> 46:51.534
Why are you watching my house?

46:54.511 --> 46:56.741
Stay back!

46:56.814 --> 46:58.748
You don't want me!

46:58.816 --> 47:00.078
I'm old!

47:00.150 --> 47:02.584
My blood's polluted with cholesterol!

47:02.653 --> 47:05.178
- What?
- Professor!

47:31.181 --> 47:32.910
Get a grip on yourself.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.980
Slow down, you maniac!

47:36.053 --> 47:38.214
You mad little bastard!
What happened?

47:38.288 --> 47:40.279
It was horrible, Professor.

47:40.357 --> 47:43.053
The monster snuck up behind me!

47:45.529 --> 47:49.056
His eyes burned like coal.

47:49.132 --> 47:52.295
Fangs 3 inches long
glistened in the moonlight.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.961
That scum!

47:54.037 --> 47:56.471
He had me totally under his spell!

47:56.540 --> 47:58.132
Thank God for this.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.175
Can I get you anything?

48:07.251 --> 48:08.741
Yes.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.377
I'd like a...

48:11.688 --> 48:14.657
a... two of those.

48:18.495 --> 48:19.985
Three T-bones.

48:21.531 --> 48:24.261
And six chickens, please.

48:25.669 --> 48:26.658
What else?

48:26.737 --> 48:29.297
I'd like a quart of pigs' blood.

48:29.373 --> 48:31.364
What was that last one?

48:31.441 --> 48:33.375
A quart of pigs' blood.

48:33.443 --> 48:35.707
"A quart of pigs' blood."

48:35.779 --> 48:37.974
- A pint.
- Pint of pigs' blood.

48:43.987 --> 48:46.217
How much for just the blood?

48:46.290 --> 48:47.848
2.59.

48:49.493 --> 48:50.755
Thank you.

48:51.962 --> 48:54.294
First time, huh, kid?

48:59.136 --> 49:01.127
I think I'm gonna puke.

49:05.375 --> 49:07.206
It's not bad.

49:08.645 --> 49:10.044
It's not bad.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.890
I can't believe it.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.862
I'm a vampire.

50:19.716 --> 50:22.116
This blood's for you.

50:22.185 --> 50:23.652
I'm proud of you, Jeremy.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.382
You got my vote
for Vampire Rookie of the Year.

50:26.456 --> 50:28.549
Why is this happening to me?

50:28.625 --> 50:30.991
I've been good.
No drugs, no alcohol.

50:31.061 --> 50:34.656
I do my homework.
Why me?

50:34.731 --> 50:39.031
Look, try not to think
of this as a handicap.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.900
I mean, there are a lot worse things
than being a vampire.

50:41.972 --> 50:44.236
Are you aware that one of past presidents

50:44.307 --> 50:46.502
of these United States was a vampire?

50:46.576 --> 50:48.009
Which one?

50:48.078 --> 50:49.545
That's not the point.

50:49.613 --> 50:52.173
I'm trying to illustrate
that life can still be full,

50:52.249 --> 50:54.114
it can still be rewarding,

50:54.184 --> 50:57.153
that there are certain advantages
to being a vampire.

50:57.220 --> 51:00.189
Yeah? Name one.

51:00.257 --> 51:01.952
All right.

51:02.025 --> 51:04.357
How old do you think I am?

51:04.428 --> 51:07.363
I don't know.
40? 50? So what?

51:09.066 --> 51:10.533
This coming October,

51:10.600 --> 51:15.401
I shall celebrate my 265th birthday.

51:15.472 --> 51:18.908
For every decade,
you shall age but a single year.

51:18.975 --> 51:21.034
That's not a bad deal.

51:21.111 --> 51:22.169
What?

51:23.346 --> 51:26.008
Wait. You're telling me
that I'm gonna be a teenager

51:26.083 --> 51:27.846
for another 20 years?

51:27.918 --> 51:30.079
Are you gonna sit around
and sulk for the next century?

51:30.153 --> 51:32.121
No.

51:32.189 --> 51:34.419
But I deserve a few minutes.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.590
I happen to like garlic.

51:37.661 --> 51:39.424
Well, it's a minor loss.

51:39.496 --> 51:41.657
Garlic just doesn't go with blood.

51:41.731 --> 51:43.858
But there are compensations.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.164
With a long life,
you're gonna have a chance

51:46.236 --> 51:48.431
to meet some of the most
fascinating people on earth.

51:48.505 --> 51:50.700
Over the years, I've known people

51:50.774 --> 51:53.265
like Pablo Picasso, Sigmund Freud,

51:53.343 --> 51:55.573
Isabel Watson, Madame Curie.

51:55.645 --> 51:57.237
Who's Isabel Watson?

51:57.314 --> 51:58.747
Trust me, she was fascinating.

51:58.815 --> 52:00.544
What's more, with time on your side,

52:00.617 --> 52:03.347
you're gonna have the opportunity
to pursue your interests to their fullest.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.251
You sound like my guidance counselor.

52:05.322 --> 52:07.483
Look, all I'm trying to say is that

52:07.557 --> 52:10.685
whether you're a vampire
or a regular person,

52:10.760 --> 52:13.923
you must set goals,
make plans, live a full life.

52:13.997 --> 52:15.225
You can live several of them.

52:15.298 --> 52:18.062
Well, that's just great,
but you're forgetting one thing.

52:18.135 --> 52:21.593
I made a fool of myself with Darla
because I'm a vampire.

52:21.671 --> 52:24.834
Come on. Men have been making fools
of themselves for centuries

52:24.908 --> 52:27.001
where women are concerned.

52:27.077 --> 52:30.376
Luckily for us, they rather like it.

52:30.447 --> 52:33.109
She'll come around as soon as she thinks
you've suffered enough.

52:33.183 --> 52:34.241
No, no.

52:34.317 --> 52:37.013
You don't know Darla Blake.

52:37.087 --> 52:41.114
Then again, there are the powers.

52:41.191 --> 52:42.658
Powers?

52:44.027 --> 52:45.358
I wish you'd read that book.

52:45.428 --> 52:47.589
I mean, you might find some
pleasant surprises in there,

52:47.664 --> 52:52.158
like how to emit
a certain irresistible charm.

52:52.235 --> 52:54.863
- What page?
- Try the index under "Trances."

52:57.174 --> 53:00.109
Hey, hey.
Can I turn into a bat?

53:00.177 --> 53:01.838
Don't be silly.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.257
Darla, hi.

53:16.326 --> 53:18.419
Listen, I wanna explain about last night.

53:18.495 --> 53:21.293
Look, you don't have to.
You came through loud and clear.

53:21.364 --> 53:22.729
No, you don't understand.

53:22.799 --> 53:25.165
I've had something happen to me recently.
I've been going through some changes.

53:25.235 --> 53:28.170
Yeah, it's called puberty, jerk,
and she's not interested.

53:28.238 --> 53:30.035
Gloria, give it a rest, okay?

53:30.106 --> 53:32.870
Darla, don't give in.
He made a fool out of you.

53:32.943 --> 53:35.844
Gloria's right, you know?
And you're doing it again.

53:35.912 --> 53:37.209
Look, I'm sorry.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.805
First date's always the worst, right?

53:39.883 --> 53:41.714
- Just give me one more chance.
- Why should I?

53:41.785 --> 53:45.221
Because I like you and because
I don't want our relationship

53:45.288 --> 53:46.550
to end before it begins.

53:46.623 --> 53:49.091
I have to get back to practice.

53:50.727 --> 53:51.716
Darla...

53:56.066 --> 53:57.294
come back.

53:59.769 --> 54:02.533
Raise your right hand.

54:08.345 --> 54:10.540
When I snap my fingers,

54:10.614 --> 54:14.812
you will awaken,
you will accept my apology,

54:14.884 --> 54:17.250
and you will go out with me
on Saturday night.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.652
Do you understand?

54:24.027 --> 54:26.018
You've gotta be kidding.

54:44.014 --> 54:45.982
Our next selection
is from Barry Manilow,

54:46.049 --> 54:48.415
- the man who writes the songs...
- Barry Manilow!

54:48.485 --> 54:49.884
Save it.

54:55.158 --> 54:57.149
Oh, no!

55:13.143 --> 55:15.907
- Hi, Mrs. Capello.
- Hi, Ralph.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.970
Oh, Ralph.

55:18.048 --> 55:20.812
You know, Jeremy's been
acting pretty weird lately.

55:20.884 --> 55:23.352
Do you have any idea
what's wrong with him?

55:23.420 --> 55:25.684
Not really.
He's a pretty complicated guy.

55:25.755 --> 55:27.950
What do you mean?

55:28.024 --> 55:30.322
He's having some girl problems.

55:30.393 --> 55:31.553
That's probably all it is.

55:31.628 --> 55:35.291
Well, Ralph, see if you can find out
what's bothering him, okay?

55:35.365 --> 55:37.799
I will, Mrs. Capello.

55:37.867 --> 55:39.232
My son...

55:39.302 --> 55:41.167
has a problem with girls?

55:41.237 --> 55:44.365
The goddamn white van is still following me.

55:44.441 --> 55:46.909
What? Why is it following you?

55:49.646 --> 55:52.080
- Is it gone?
- Yeah.

55:53.683 --> 55:55.480
Man, I don't get this.

55:55.552 --> 55:57.110
Ralph, I've got something to tell you.

55:58.988 --> 56:00.114
I'm...

56:00.190 --> 56:02.715
I'm a vampire.

56:05.562 --> 56:07.086
That's cool, man.

56:07.163 --> 56:09.495
That's all you're gonna
say to me..."That's cool"?

56:09.566 --> 56:11.796
Jeremy, you're my best friend.
What do you want me to say?

56:11.868 --> 56:13.267
- "I think you're crazy"?
- No, no.

56:13.336 --> 56:15.861
Remember I was telling you
about that cop that was trailing me?

56:15.939 --> 56:16.928
Yeah?

56:17.006 --> 56:19.167
He told me that that woman
who bit me was a vampire.

56:19.242 --> 56:20.766
He told me I was a vampire.

56:20.844 --> 56:22.277
A cop told you that?

56:22.345 --> 56:23.573
Ralph, he wasn't a cop.

56:23.646 --> 56:25.079
He's a vampire, too.

56:25.148 --> 56:26.274
Wow.

56:26.349 --> 56:27.816
You don't believe me, do you?

56:27.884 --> 56:29.943
To tell you the truth, man, I'm kinda torn.

56:30.019 --> 56:33.079
See, I have this problem
with vampirism in general.

56:33.156 --> 56:36.023
Come on, let me show you something.
Come on. Let's go.

56:42.465 --> 56:43.830
Go in.

56:49.172 --> 56:50.400
What?

56:50.473 --> 56:52.236
Watch this.

56:55.612 --> 56:57.102
Well?

56:57.180 --> 56:58.977
It's a trick.

56:59.048 --> 57:01.710
A trick?

57:01.785 --> 57:04.720
Yeah, David Copperfield
does this stuff all the time.

57:04.788 --> 57:09.020
I once saw him make
the Statue of Liberty disappear.

57:09.092 --> 57:10.116
Okay.

57:13.930 --> 57:18.629
But let me show you something
David Copperfield doesn't do.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.072
Yeah, it's red and it's liquid.

57:30.146 --> 57:31.909
Is it blood?

57:43.426 --> 57:44.723
Hey, Ralph.

57:50.900 --> 57:53.926
Well, what did he say?

57:54.003 --> 57:55.527
You don't want to know.

57:55.605 --> 57:57.664
Ralph, I'm his mother.

57:57.740 --> 57:59.731
I want to know what's bothering him.

57:59.809 --> 58:01.106
No, you don't.

58:01.177 --> 58:02.872
Trust me.

58:02.946 --> 58:06.507
Some things are too personal.

58:07.917 --> 58:09.578
Too personal?

58:12.021 --> 58:14.990
Oh, my God.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.227
Jeremy.

58:29.305 --> 58:31.967
I just dropped in to say good-bye.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.565
You're leaving?

58:33.643 --> 58:35.270
My work is finished here.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.573
Terrific.

58:36.646 --> 58:39.171
My life is ruined and you're going on.

58:39.249 --> 58:40.546
What's gonna happen?

58:40.617 --> 58:42.244
Well, that's entirely up to you.

58:42.318 --> 58:44.718
My purpose was merely to point you
in the right direction,

58:44.787 --> 58:47.381
not to hold your hand forever.

58:47.457 --> 58:50.324
You're going to be a vampire
for a long, long time.

58:50.393 --> 58:52.327
I know.

58:52.395 --> 58:54.659
There's just...

58:54.731 --> 58:58.223
still so much I don't know.

58:58.301 --> 58:59.928
What if I screw up?

59:00.003 --> 59:03.302
What if people find out?

59:03.373 --> 59:05.500
Everybody screws up.

59:05.575 --> 59:06.940
Dead or undead.

59:07.010 --> 59:09.774
People who love you
will always protect you.

59:09.846 --> 59:11.905
Remember that.

59:11.981 --> 59:13.710
I just got used to having you around.

59:15.251 --> 59:17.879
Don't get sentimental on me.

59:17.954 --> 59:20.286
And by the way,
I'm going to need to park my car

59:20.356 --> 59:21.983
for the next century or so.

59:22.058 --> 59:25.323
- Do you think you can look after it for me?
- You're kidding.

59:25.395 --> 59:27.522
This is great!

59:27.597 --> 59:29.326
Wait'll Ralph sees this.

59:31.467 --> 59:33.162
The Professor's after Ralph now.

59:33.236 --> 59:34.635
He thinks he's one of us.

59:34.704 --> 59:38.140
Well, it's a rather unsavory trait of man

59:38.207 --> 59:40.835
that whenever he stumbles
across something different,

59:40.910 --> 59:44.311
quite often his first impulse
is to destroy it.

59:44.380 --> 59:46.314
Vampire's are like any other minority

59:46.382 --> 59:49.146
that's been persecuted
down through the ages.

59:49.218 --> 59:52.153
Our reputations are a bit
more tarnished than that.

59:52.221 --> 59:56.157
I mean, people think
we're blood-sucking monsters.

59:56.225 --> 01:00:00.719
I'm afraid a few bad apples
back in the Dark Ages

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:03.163
spoiled it for the rest of us.

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:06.599
Professor McCarthy
is not one to forgive and forget.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.160
What is it with this guy?
What's his problem?

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:12.036
He's quite mad, of course.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.008
But don't be misled.

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.204
He poses a very real threat.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.770
What do I do?

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.976
You're a vampire, Jeremy.

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.951
Use it.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:32.353
Louis, Jeremy's behavior
is just too peculiar to ignore.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.988
Ralph says he has
some problem with girls.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.326
Yes.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:39.061
And I know I heard a man's voice

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.535
up in his room the other night.

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.632
The man in the BMW.

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:49.401
Good night.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.141
Jeremy, where are you going?

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.374
Out.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.509
You know your father and I are here

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:59.987
to talk about anything
that might be bothering you.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.683
That's great, Mom.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:03.191
Louis.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.954
Do you have anything you want to tell us?

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:07.826
Just good night.

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.475
Where did he get that car?

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:25.946
It's that same Artic Blue BMW 735.

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.209
What does that license plate mean?

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:49.795
You're not getting any of my blood.

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.163
Hey!

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.038
Go away.

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.602
Come on, open up.
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.483
Thank you.

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.022
That's far enough, Count Dracula.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:12.323
What... Ralph, will you cut it out?

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.022
I had to tell somebody.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.689
Why did it have to be me?

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.960
'Cause you're my best friend.
I need you.

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.264
So I can lure young virgins

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.634
back to your lair for a midnight snack?

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:23.797
Not me, pal.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.864
Don't be a jerk.

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:28.274
This is too much, man.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.606
Ralph, I'm still the same person.

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.476
I'm not some monster.

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.640
Okay, let me think.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.081
Okay, look, we're in this thing
together, all right?

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.489
My lips are sealed.

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.925
Just make sure yours stay that way, too.

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.088
I don't want to wake up a few pints low.

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:50.029
Great.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.896
So now what do we do?

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.301
I don't know.

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.782
What are we doing here?

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.512
Hey, look, if vampires really have
secret powers over women,

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:11.985
you can't hold out on your best friend.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.419
Look at these girls.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.218
Ralph, I haven't even read this yet.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.883
You'll do fine. Just wing it.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.824
Now look, I'm not choosy, okay?

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.089
Tall blonde, skinny brunette...

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:21.221
I'll take anything.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.992
Almost anything.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:28.002
Come on. Let's go over here.

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.101
- That girl.
- Like her?

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.108
Yeah. Go to it Count Capello.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.803
Do your thing.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:41.780
- What a hunk.
- Him?

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.819
That face.

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.911
That body.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:49.651
Now he's a walking sex machine.

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.792
Missed by that much.

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:03.797
My God, it's an entire satanic cult!

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.067
Grimsdyke, you take the back.

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.301
Be careful.

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.883
Blonde at the bar.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.857
Now nothing fancy, okay?

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.187
A simple love slave will do.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.285
Love slave.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.632
One love slave to go.

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.830
Hey, nice glasses.

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:35.734
Look, is it okay if we go to your place?

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:38.672
My parents wouldn't understand
all the screaming and moaning

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.299
coming from my bedroom.

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:46.548
- Well...
- Satisfied?

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.039
Her.

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:53.046
All right. If I blow it, you're on your own.

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.817
- You understand?
- Well, just nail her.

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.370
Make me your love slave.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.534
Oh, my God!

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.805
Get the hell off of me, man.

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:22.108
Grimsdyke!

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:24.482
Professor, no!

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.251
Pull yourself together!

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:31.316
- Ralph!
- Who is that guy, man?

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.793
Come on. Let's get out of here!

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.022
Did you get him?

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.463
Here, hold this.

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:41.969
I'll be right back.

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.078
Don't just sit there, Grimsdyke.

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.245
They're getting away.

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.690
Ralph, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:02.883
Yeah?

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.358
Apparently there's some nutcase
running around

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.418
trying to wipe vampires out of existence.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:09.089
He's the guy that broke down the door
and torched the Gardner place.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.996
Don't worry.
I won't let him get to you.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.297
He's also the guy that drives the white van.

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.631
The guy that's been following you.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:15.728
What are you saying?

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.170
That they think I'm a vampire?

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.729
They can't be that stupid.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.173
If they kill me, I'm dust.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.073
If they kill you, it's murder, right?

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.543
Yeah, great.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:24.601
Thanks a lot.

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:37.115
We have to face the facts, honey.

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:38.387
Our son is gay.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.090
How do you feel about that?

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:44.564
I really wanted grandchildren.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.115
Oh, my God. There he is.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.156
- She's here, stud.
- What?

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:10.021
- Where?
- Corner table. Don't look.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.457
Don't look!

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.757
Don't look.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.494
This is dumb.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:28.699
Hi, Darla.

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.303
- You never give up, do you?
- No.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.847
Darla, l...

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.314
Look, you're important to me.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:36.715
Just give me one more chance.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.117
I don't know, Jeremy.

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:41.350
I like you, but you're so weird.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:42.584
He'll freak out on you again.

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:45.183
I won't freak out. I promise.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.388
Look, I had some problems before, okay?

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:49.693
But I'm fine now.

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.289
Don't make me beg.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:54.564
- Make him beg.
- I'm begging.

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.029
Shit.

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:59.631
Don't make any foolhardy
attempt to run away.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.767
This revolver is pointing at your navel.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.573
It's loaded with silver bullets.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.580
- Professor, there's a...
- Be quiet.

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:08.913
You will slowly get up and walk out
to that van parked in the street.

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.612
If you so much as bat an eyelid,
I won't hesitate to use this.

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:14.850
- Is that clear?
- Perfect. Very.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.448
Let's go!

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:21.890
Okay, I'll give you one more chance.

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.734
That wasn't too weird, was it?

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:31.295
Look, I know you think I'm gonna
go bananas any minute, but I'm not.

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.832
Where's Ralph?

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.572
He just left with a couple of freaks.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:38.943
What?

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:41.642
That's them over there in that van.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.344
Come on.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.885
Wait, don't go.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.459
Hurry! Get in.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.398
Are we stealing this car?

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.395
Hey, look.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:04.996
You guys are making a big mistake here.

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:06.803
I'm not a vampire.

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.106
I hate the taste of blood.
I hate the sight of blood.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:12.113
Professor, maybe he's telling the truth.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.443
Lies, all lies.

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:14.505
Don't listen, Grimsdyke.

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:17.416
These bastards will say anything
to protect their black hearts.

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:18.885
You promised you wouldn't freak out!

01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:20.353
You know that?
You promised!

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.822
I'm sorry. Darla, my best friend's
about to be murdered.

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.019
Murdered? By whom?

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.287
It's a long story.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.761
It's really me they should be after.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.991
What are you talking about?

01:09:30.064 --> 01:09:31.930
Professor McCarthy... he's a maniac.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.524
He thinks Ralph's a vampire.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.194
That's crazy.

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:37.636
Of course, it's crazy.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:40.334
Ralph's not the vampire.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:41.876
I'm the vampire.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.506
Oh, my God.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.140
There they are.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:57.288
Professor, somebody's following us.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.020
That's right, pal.

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:02.791
The FBI, the CIA, the National Guard!

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.264
And when all this over,

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.392
my dad is going to kick your ass!

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.974
Evasive action, Grimsdyke.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.635
Yes, Professor.

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:25.713
I'm not crazy, okay?

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.619
Whatever you're thinking,
please believe me.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.782
I need your help.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:32.793
Modoc told me someone that really cares
will never let you down.

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:34.260
Modoc?

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:38.890
He's... He's my vampire advisor.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.337
You're gonna kill us!

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:55.005
Darla, remember what we said
about being different?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.278
Different, yes.

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.411
Like being taller or skinnier
or wearing braces.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.785
Or maybe even being just a little bit weird.

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:03.051
But not being a vampire.

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:11.859
Cops! All right!
Hang on, Ralph.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.300
BMW, license plate "NITEMAN."

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.632
Westbound on Allen Parkway.

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.569
32 X-ray, request assist.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.006
Roger. All units in vicinity
of Allen Parkway

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.702
roll to assist 32 X-ray.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.574
Pursuit of a blue BMW, westbound...

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:28.741
Oh, my God!

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:38.751
- You okay?
- Stop!

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.469
Hang on, Darla.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.467
Shit!

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.482
Good work, Grimsdyke.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:05.782
It looks like the cavalry's
been cut off at the pass.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:08.622
Freeze!

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.563
You kids all right?

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.933
Yeah, I think so.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.403
We have to stop the white van.

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:24.996
They're gonna kill Ralph.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.974
Take it easy, kid.
You're in shock.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.873
They're gonna murder him.
We have to stop it.

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:31.242
Relax, son.
We'll get you an ambulance.

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:33.178
Listen to me.
They're crazy.

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.476
They're vampire hunters.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:36.040
They think my friend's a vampire.

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.552
They've kidnapped him
and they're going to kill him.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:43.289
Hey, Wally, looks like we've got
another vampire hunter on our hands.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.656
Another one?

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.251
See?

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.489
Damn. We better call in
a Code V and get after 'em.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.498
Come on, kids.
Let's get to the car.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:52.534
Come on.

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:55.664
Let's go!

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:58.697
Come on!

01:12:58.774 --> 01:12:59.866
Hey.

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.138
You can't do this!

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.338
Yeah, right.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.903
Sober up, kid.

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.812
Hey!

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.216
Ralph's gonna die and it's all my fault.

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.052
Maybe not.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.024
I don't believe you're gonna do this.

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:23.087
You don't believe it?

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.303
Holy shit!

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.782
Come on, hurry up.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.285
That was great!

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:47.822
I could be falling for you.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.551
Don't push your luck.

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.029
This is One Adam-12.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.001
I'd like to put out an APB
on a white Ford van,

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:04.004
last seen heading north
on Henderson Way.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.734
And, Mom, if you're listening,

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:10.006
I'd like to tell you
that this really isn't my fault.

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:12.308
I had to steal this police car
in order to save Ralph.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:13.746
Oh, my God! Let's go!

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.977
And, Mom, I'd like you to meet Darla Blake.

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:18.417
Hello, Mrs. Capello.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.148
She's great, Mom.
You'll love her.

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.884
Hurry up, Louis. Run!

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.984
Our son's in trouble!

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.557
Come on!
Where are you, buddy?

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.100
I think they went that way.

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.432
- Where?
- That way.

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:40.401
Stolen police unit traveling north
on Highway 41.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.943
Proceed with caution.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.240
Perpetrator is presumed
armed and dangerous.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:47.043
Repeat, perp is presumed
armed and dangerous.

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.275
That's our baby.

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.649
Turn there.

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:05.925
We'll release the creature's soul
on sanctified ground.

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:14.837
Come on, you piece of junk!

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:15.899
Haul ass!

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:18.139
You heard him. Haul ass!

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:21.640
Hang on, Ralph.

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.500
Grimsdyke, will you stop that?

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:41.994
Come here.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:48.173
- You do this one.
- Me, Professor?

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.676
Yes, you.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:58.652
Right. Now, you hit the stake
right in the center.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.883
Hard enough to drive the shaft
through the ribcage,

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:04.482
into the chest cavity,
piercing the heart.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.618
Go on.

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.255
Go on.

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.967
I can't do it.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:20.338
I've never hurt a human being in my life.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.332
Wait! There it is.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.874
You're a spineless creature, Grimsdyke.

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:30.009
Now I've got to do it myself.

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:47.396
May God have mercy on your soul.

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.061
Stop!

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:53.297
Hi.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.967
I know what this must look like.

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.943
How about attempted murder?

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.604
No, you're mistaken.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.671
We're just performing a little exorcism.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:03.718
This is a vile,
disgusting creature of the night.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.753
A vampire.

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.186
We're the good guys.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:10.554
You kill him and you'll fry
for Murder One, pal, guaranteed.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.116
No way.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:13.661
There won't even be a corpse.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:16.095
He'll crumble to dust
before your very eyes.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:18.155
- Watch.
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:21.100
If he is a vampire, that's one thing.

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:23.797
If he isn't, an innocent guy is dead.

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:25.806
Yes, yes, yes.

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:27.637
That's a chance I'm prepared to take.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:28.971
Forget it.

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.978
Let's see some proof.

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.446
What's in your little
vampire hunters kit there?

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.244
You have a crucifix, right?

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.117
Maybe he's a Jewish vampire.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.557
Right.

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:47.026
What else have you got?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.997
String of garlic.

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.432
And you were gonna kill this guy?

01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:59.297
Holy water, right?

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.398
Good idea.

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.204
Nothing worse than a dirty vampire.

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:03.676
And the stake.

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:07.146
If I kill him with a stake through the heart,
he's definitely a vampire.

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.115
A stake through the heart
would kill anything.

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:12.381
I'm afraid this evidence
wouldn't be too persuasive

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.513
at your murder trial.

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.352
Grimsdyke, you've made a mistake.

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.722
Let him go.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.094
A mistake?

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.897
That's all?

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.459
No apology?

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.335
No "I'm sorry, Ralph"?

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:33.135
"I beg your pardon, Ralph"?

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.938
"Sorry about that stake
through your heart, Ralph"!

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:40.542
You sly little bloodsucker, you.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.094
- Come on!
- The car!

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.794
Ralph, the car...

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.268
Ralph, wait!

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:10.140
The car is over there.

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:11.679
No problem. Follow me.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.079
Right.

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.207
Come on!

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.183
Freeze!

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.117
No need to remind you that silver bullets

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:21.553
serve the same purpose
as a stake through the heart.

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.147
Professor...

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.522
Okay.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.926
You have me.

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:29.554
Let them go.

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.861
They're only innocent bystanders.

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:36.432
Your heroic plea has been
noted and rejected.

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.234
Do I really think I'll let you kill me?

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:39.933
My friends?

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.873
I don't see how you can prevent it.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:47.173
You forget, Professor, I'm a vampire.

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:51.777
That has certain advantages.

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:54.913
You've abandoned
your precious tools, Professor.

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:58.187
You have no crucifix,
no garlic, no holy water.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.693
Grimsdyke, shoot him!

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.094
I can't!

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:05.361
Luckily for you, I don't kill people.

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:08.732
Aren't you gonna drain my blood?

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.795
You sound disappointed.

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:13.363
No, just surprised.

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.966
Pleasantly surprised.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.341
Didn't you hear me?

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.281
I'm letting you go.

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:25.581
I'll never stop coming after you, never!

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:28.521
Why? What do I have to do, kill you?

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.285
Rip your heart out?

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:32.087
Do it, Jeremy.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.185
Let's share a toast with his blood.

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.991
Nora.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.929
You've returned from the grave.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.365
Of course. I'm a vampire.

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:42.027
Who's she?

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.571
Join me, Jeremy,

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:46.630
in a taste of immorality.

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:49.108
Starting with the professor's blood.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:50.303
Well, surely you wouldn't...

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:51.675
You were eager enough to kill me.

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.270
That was different.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:54.781
Go, Professor.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:58.183
You see we're not all the insidious
creatures you'd like to believe.

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:00.778
All we want is a chance to live in peace

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.950
without worrying about someone
trying to ram a stake through our hearts.

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.752
Bravo, my boy. Bravo.

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:13.895
I've waited a long time to get you
into my sights, old man.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:19.131
My dear professor,
why does it have to be this way?

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.641
When will you understand
that I'm not your enemy?

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:28.509
- Grimsdyke, where'd you get these bullets?
- But, Professor...

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:31.381
Now I'm gonna have to rip him apart
with my bare hands.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.477
As you wish.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.114
But first, allow me
to introduce some friends.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:47.694
This is getting interesting.

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:50.260
Oh, no. Not that.

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:53.330
Grimsdyke, what are they gonna do to me?

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:54.875
Oh, my goodness.

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.706
Grimsdyke, don't let them take me away.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:57.802
Grimsdyke!

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.278
Don't let them take me away.

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:00.871
Grimsdyke, help me!

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:07.449
What'll happen to him?

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:10.685
What better way to vanquish an enemy
than to make him an ally?

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.353
Help me!

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.453
Hey, are those chicks
coming back or what?

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:19.156
Wait a minute.
You were shot.

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.929
With silver bullets.

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:24.199
Jeremy, once again you're guilty
of not reading your handbook.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:26.172
Silver bullets are an effective means

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:30.371
of dispatching werewolves, not vampires.

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.606
I don't even want to get into werewolves.

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.444
Professor...

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.242
What have they done to you?

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.780
Well, this is an ironic turn of events,
isn't it, Grimsdyke?

01:22:42.857 --> 01:22:45.087
What's to become of you?

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.094
I don't know.

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:50.859
Maybe I'll run with the pack
for a while, see what happens.

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:53.457
I feel 20 years younger.

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.559
Bye, Grimsdyke.

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.377
I'm afraid that's our signal.

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.040
You're welcome to join us, Jeremy.

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:11.017
You'd be among friends,
with others like yourself.

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.144
Thanks, Modoc.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.347
But I have school tomorrow.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:17.585
Besides, I have a few friends right here.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.684
Good-bye, Jeremy.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.592
Good-bye, Modoc.

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:25.960
Okay, listen, next time
you're in town, give me a call.

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:27.433
We'll go out for a drink.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:28.833
Bloody Marys.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.941
Come, children. Away!

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.615
This has been one hell of a night.

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:57.859
I've gotta read that book.

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.830
Look, Louis!
There they are over there!

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.532
Look, honey! Turn around.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.813
Jeremy?

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.684
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.087
Son.

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:58.057
Guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:01.493
We know that you've been
going through this change lately.

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:04.691
Wait, you knew?
You knew all along?

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.290
We're not blind, Jeremy.

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:08.562
We know what's going on in the world.

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:11.036
We don't want to be part of your problem.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.734
Just be happy with who you are.

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.742
Incredible.

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:20.739
Mom, Dad, this is Darla Blake.

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:22.783
She's my new girlfriend.

01:25:24.352 --> 01:25:29.255
Well, we're very, very happy to meet you.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.924
Unbelievable.
