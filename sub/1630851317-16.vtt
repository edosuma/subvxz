<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.482 --> 00:07.398
I would like to propose that we
produce a series of commercials

00:07.442 --> 00:08.747
for TikTok,

00:08.791 --> 00:11.054
YouTube, Instagram,
all of social media.

00:11.098 --> 00:13.013
Or an infomercial for TV.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.232
No one watches TV anymore.

00:15.276 --> 00:18.714
- I do.
- Then we should make an infomercial for TV.

00:18.757 --> 00:19.932
I'm Bob Wheeler,

00:19.976 --> 00:22.065
president and CEO
of MaxDot.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.067
When you buy a pair
of MaxDot socks,

00:24.111 --> 00:25.416
you're not just
a customer--

00:25.460 --> 00:26.809
you're part of the family.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.419
Isn't that right,
Abishola?

00:28.463 --> 00:30.465
That's right, Bob.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.423
We love our...

00:32.467 --> 00:34.904
- MaxDot socks!
- MaxDot socks!

00:34.947 --> 00:38.299
Married couples love
MaxDot socks.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.130
Medical professionals
love MaxDot socks.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.568
We rely on them
every day.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.265
So the next time we see ya,

00:48.309 --> 00:49.614
don't be shy.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.834

Try not to
move your head.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.690
You look familiar.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.301
Ever play bingo at the church
over on Belmont Street?

01:24.345 --> 01:26.782
- No.
- What about offtrack betting?

01:26.825 --> 01:28.131
You play the ponies?

01:28.175 --> 01:29.350
No ponies.

01:29.393 --> 01:30.873
Dogs?

01:30.916 --> 01:32.309
No.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.442
I'm not gonna be able
to enjoy my operation

01:34.485 --> 01:36.270
till I figure this out.

01:36.313 --> 01:37.619
If it makes you feel better,

01:37.662 --> 01:39.011
I do not recognize you,

01:39.055 --> 01:41.231
nor will I remember you.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.843
Okay, let's put your feet
back under the covers.

01:44.887 --> 01:47.846
Oh. Feet! Socks!

01:47.890 --> 01:49.631
You're from
that sock commercial!

01:49.674 --> 01:50.719
Yes, I am.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.329
- Say it.
- I'd rather not.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.417
Say it.

01:54.723 --> 01:57.334
♪ MaxDot socks,
socks that rock. ♪

01:57.378 --> 01:59.293

02:02.252 --> 02:03.340
Show us your socks!

02:03.384 --> 02:06.256
Thank you. Very nice.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.258
I've been getting
it all day, too.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.260
Careful of the little
dude in the wheelchair.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.741
He showed me more
than his socks.

02:22.446 --> 02:23.839
Can you believe
all this?

02:23.882 --> 02:26.407
Today I got pulled over
for going 70 in a school zone.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.712
Cop recognized me,

02:27.756 --> 02:29.236
showed me his socks.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.498
Wow! So no ticket?

02:30.541 --> 02:31.673
Course I got a ticket.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.240
It was a school zone, Bob.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.896
Abishola, I can't talk
right now! It's crazy here!

02:37.940 --> 02:38.897
I love you!

02:38.941 --> 02:40.377
I love you, too, sir!

03:13.976 --> 03:15.195
That's not gonna work.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.631
Our commercial aired
before <i>Blue Bloods.</i>

03:16.674 --> 03:19.242
Every old person in
the country's ordered the socks.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.722
<i>Blue Bloods?</i>

03:20.765 --> 03:22.463
Yeah! <i>Blue Bloods!</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:27.772
Well, good for her.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.252
Just get me the socks!

03:32.995 --> 03:35.389
I didn't know sooner.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.917
Well, I didn't.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.097
Wati!

03:52.623 --> 03:54.277
Wati!

03:58.194 --> 04:00.109
How many times I got to say it?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.639
- What are you doing?
- It's 6:00. We're going home.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.425
But there are more shipments
to go out tonight.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.991
They'll go out tomorrow.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.734
I see.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.868
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.045
See ya in the morning.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.786
No, you will not.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.527
Good luck
on your future endeavors.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.355
Dude, you can't
threaten to fire me

04:28.398 --> 04:30.052
just 'cause I don't
want to work overtime.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.489
You will not get fired. I will.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.623
When thousands of customers
do not get their orders,

04:35.666 --> 04:36.798
they will want blood.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.452
Supervisor blood!

04:38.495 --> 04:41.629
Goodbye. Goodbye.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.153
Until we meet again.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.502
On the street.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.853
Where I will be living.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.466
Bob's not gonna fire you.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.468
What choice does he have?

04:54.511 --> 04:55.686
I have failed him.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.646
But do not worry about me.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.997
Go home to your families.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.433
Hug them.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.349
Hold them close!

05:06.393 --> 05:09.483
Because your life
can change in an instant!

05:12.050 --> 05:15.140
I suppose we can help you out
a little longer.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.360
All of you?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.144
Because it has to be all of you.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.888
I'm sorry, honey.
I-I don't think

05:23.932 --> 05:25.673
I'm gonna make it home
for dinner.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.893
Oh, Bob, that is wonderful.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.199
It is?

05:30.242 --> 05:31.374
You are so successful,

05:31.418 --> 05:33.071
you have no time
for your family.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.856
Mwah.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.118
What was that?

05:36.161 --> 05:37.728
I blew you a kiss.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.513
You've never done that before.

05:39.556 --> 05:42.080
You never earned it before.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.081
Hello?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.909
Abishola?

05:47.085 --> 05:49.044
<i>E kaale,</i> Mummy.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.698
<i>Kaale.</i>

05:50.741 --> 05:52.700
Bob will not be home
for dinner.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.223
Because he's working late.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.181
Congratulations.

05:56.225 --> 05:59.837
May his success have you
eating alone for years to come.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.884
I approve of this marriage.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.276
We're already married.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.277
Yes.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.323
And now I approve.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.542
You did not before?

06:08.585 --> 06:10.457
No.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.768
All right. I got a cargo plane
full of socks on the tarmac

06:17.812 --> 06:20.249
at Kuala Lumpur--
should be here by Thursday.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.686
Attaboy, Bobby!

06:22.730 --> 06:23.731
Careful with that thing!

06:23.774 --> 06:25.907
Sorry. I'm excited.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.778
Feels like
the good old days.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.259
When your father and I
started this company,

06:30.302 --> 06:33.567
there were times
we'd work 48 hours straight.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.177
How is that possible?

06:35.220 --> 06:36.787
Easy. We were young,

06:36.831 --> 06:38.398
and we had cocaine.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.574
Mom!

06:40.617 --> 06:42.576
It was the '70s.
It's what you did.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.534
Right off this table.

06:46.014 --> 06:49.974
Mr. Wheeler, with our sales
rising at an unprecedented pace,

06:50.018 --> 06:53.282
your mother and I
have been focused on the future.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.110
We want to make sure
the tracks are clear

06:55.153 --> 06:57.242
so we can keep
this gravy train chuggin'.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.331
We have identified the following

06:59.375 --> 07:01.508
as possible hindrances
to our success.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.685
Our limited
dock capacity.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.164
Outdated equipment.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.818
And...

07:09.341 --> 07:11.822
...the following individuals.

07:11.866 --> 07:15.478
We're calling them
the Feeble 15.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.654
You want to fire people?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.134
Well, not tonight, honey.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.831
We need them
to finish their shift.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.181
We wouldn't be here
without these guys.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.009
They helped us get where we are.

07:25.053 --> 07:28.012
And we will say thank you
when we fire them.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.319
These people

07:30.362 --> 07:31.799
are holding us back!

07:32.843 --> 07:34.715
I love this thing.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.544
We can't fire Jerry.
He has four kids.

07:37.587 --> 07:38.719
I went to his wedding.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.982
I sent a small gift
but did not attend,

07:41.025 --> 07:43.854
because I know
how to set boundaries!

07:43.898 --> 07:45.552
Rule number one--

07:45.595 --> 07:48.598
never name the animals
on the farm.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.600
Then you can't eat them.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.299
Actually, my uncle
named all his goats.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.171
The best stew I ever had

07:56.214 --> 07:58.042
was from a goat
named George Michael.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.524
We're not firing
anybody, you hear me?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.352
We're gonna stay loyal
to the goats

08:03.395 --> 08:04.658
that got us here.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.659
Oh.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.360
I think he's too
soft for this.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.101
Mm.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.409
Shall I add him to the list?

08:18.367 --> 08:19.934
Goodwin, he's my son.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.241
I'll do it.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.727
Bob's commercial
- is everywhere.
- Oh.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.904
Today, someone recognized us
- at Baskin-
- Robbins.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.384
We sang them
the jingle.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.299
And they turned
our single-scoop cups

08:37.342 --> 08:40.781
into double-scoop
waffle cones!

08:40.824 --> 08:43.740
It just goes to show you
what a man can accomplish

08:43.784 --> 08:46.047
when he has
two strong women behind him.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.397
Mm.
Three,
if you include Abishola.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.746
And a loyal uncle.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.966
I have always been Team Bob.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.054
Me, too.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.664
Yes, but I was first.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.580
Now that you
are wealthy,

08:57.624 --> 08:59.060
the pastor
will be expecting

08:59.103 --> 09:00.975
bigger donations
from you and Bob at church.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.454
Mm.
For enough money,

09:02.498 --> 09:04.108
they will put
your name on a pew.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.284
Wouldn't that be fun, Dele?

09:07.285 --> 09:08.460
Sure.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.420
Now with these
additional funds,

09:11.463 --> 09:13.640
we will have to rethink
the whole guesthouse.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.730
What guesthouse?

09:16.773 --> 09:18.732
The guesthouse you
are building for me.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.951
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.605
Because there was
nothing to discuss

09:22.649 --> 09:24.128
until the permits
were approved.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.913
Do not worry.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.305
I have seen
the plans.

09:27.349 --> 09:30.613
It is going to be beautiful!

09:30.657 --> 09:33.224
Have you told Bob
how proud you are of him?

09:33.268 --> 09:35.618
I tried,
but he was too busy to talk.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.272
Oh!

09:38.447 --> 09:40.841
Oh, I'm glad I hugged him
the last time I saw him.

09:40.884 --> 09:43.626
Who knows
when we will see him again?

09:43.670 --> 09:47.935
Until then, this chair will
sit empty in his honor.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.327
To Bob.

09:49.371 --> 09:52.330
- We are so proud of you.
- Mm.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.419
Finally.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.950
It's nice to see you helping out
on the floor, Kofo.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.387
Teamwork makes for
the dream work, Mr. Wheeler.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.171
Did you miss being down here?

10:07.215 --> 10:08.520
Not for one second.

10:08.564 --> 10:11.785
Ever heard of a town
called Surprise, Arizona?

10:11.828 --> 10:13.264
- No.
- Me, either, but a company there

10:13.308 --> 10:15.179
just ordered 10,000 pairs
of socks.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.529
- 10,000?
- Surprise.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.836
Jerry, the orders
are backing up.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.142
I need you to get
off the phone.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.317
Yeah, I'm talking to my boy.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.797
He just got his yellow belt.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.146
That's great.
Can you wrap it up?

10:25.189 --> 10:26.321
Yeah, it'll just be a minute.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.975
No, no, no, it's fine.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.367
It's just Uncle Bob.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.152
Yeah, Uncle Bob needs
Daddy to get back to work.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.457
Yeah, sure, put your mom on.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.545
Hang up the phone.

10:33.589 --> 10:34.677
Just give me a second.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.810
I said hang up!

10:36.853 --> 10:38.681
Everybody, listen.
I don't want to be a jerk here,

10:38.725 --> 10:40.814
but we don't have time
for slacking off.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.338
Okay, from now on,
when you're at work, you work.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.427
No more phone calls
about karate.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.429
- Jujitsu.
- I don't care!

10:48.604 --> 10:51.259
You all have no idea how close
you are to being fired.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.827
And the only thing standing in
the way of that happening is me.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.524
You want to be goat stew, Jerry?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.352
- No.
- No, you don't.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.094
Everybody, get back to work.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.357
He's so scary when he yells.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.272
Yeah.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.230
It's beautiful.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.710
Three of these, two hours, okay?

11:07.754 --> 11:10.539
Shall I remove his
name from the list?

11:10.582 --> 11:11.975
No rush.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.994
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.822
- What are you doing?
- Coming home from work.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
But it is 7:00 in the morning.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.565
Oh, then I guess
I'm leaving for work.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.221
- It was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.483
Are you sure
you're okay to drive?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.832
You bet.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.840
Sorry! Forgot it was Tuesday!

11:58.326 --> 11:59.893
Christina Wheeler's office.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.764
It's her brother Bob. Is she in?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.897
Can I say what this
is regarding?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.637
Uh, I'm driving to work

12:05.681 --> 12:07.944
and wanted to call
and talk to my sister?

12:07.988 --> 12:12.949
"Not business-related."

12:12.993 --> 12:15.125
One moment, please.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.605
Hey, Bob.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.085
Hey, how's it going?

12:18.128 --> 12:19.782
Good. How's it going with you?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.653
Good. Just busy.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.569
Mm, I heard. Congratulations.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.789
Yeah.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.096
What's going on?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.620
Nothing. Can't a guy
just call his sister

12:31.663 --> 12:34.101
and get some reassurance that...

12:34.144 --> 12:36.668
he's a good boss
and not a monster?

12:37.669 --> 12:38.888
Did you yell?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.761
Yeah, I kind of lost it.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.111
You're very scary when you yell.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.852
I know.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.810
You yelled at me once
at the Deerfield Mall.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.159
I never went in there again.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.639
You never went in there again

12:50.682 --> 12:53.294
because you got caught shoplifting.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.992
Funny, I can't remember
what I took,

12:56.036 --> 12:58.690
but I can remember you yelling.

12:58.734 --> 13:02.520
It was two lip glosses
and a Spice Girls CD.

13:02.564 --> 13:06.307
It was a cry for help
and no one answered the call.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.657
Okay, I should get going.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.051
I'm glad I could
be here for you.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.183
Sure.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.489
Bob, don't worry.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.404
Everyone at work
will forgive you.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.972
Thanks, Christina.

13:19.015 --> 13:23.150
Forgive... but never forget.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.195
All right.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.682
Morning, everybody.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.339
Brought in a little treat

13:38.382 --> 13:40.645
to show I appreciate
your hard work.

13:40.689 --> 13:44.519
We've all been under
a lot of stress. I know I have.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.914
But nothing helps you
start fresh like hot doughnuts.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.524
Come and get 'em.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.706
Douglas, help me out here.

13:57.749 --> 13:58.881
Have a doughnut.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.187
Is this a test?

14:00.230 --> 14:01.710
How would this be a test?

14:01.753 --> 14:04.104
Whoever stops working
to have one of those doughnuts

14:04.147 --> 14:06.236
ends up on your Feeble 15 list.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.369
- No, you won't.
- So there is a list.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.197
Jerry, you were right.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.635
I was just trying
to do something nice.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.768
Jerry, I got you a bear claw,
your favorite.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.383
Connie.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.429
Oh, don't be scared.
- Th-
- They got sprinkles.

14:26.778 --> 14:27.997
Nobody?

14:29.085 --> 14:30.608
Nobody's gonna eat
these doughnuts

14:30.652 --> 14:33.916
I spent 30 minutes
standing in line for?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.092
To show my thanks.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.094
For all your hard work...

14:38.138 --> 14:40.749
and dedication.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.795
Well, fine.
You're gonna be like that?

14:46.102 --> 14:48.757
I will forgive you for being
on your phone, but I will

14:48.800 --> 14:53.153
never forgive you for making me
throw away doughnuts.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.504
Any of you. Get back to work.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.595
Congratulations, sir.
The workers are terrified.

15:00.638 --> 15:01.813
Move!

15:01.857 --> 15:03.467
Magnificent.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.430
Yes, it is me.

15:09.473 --> 15:13.651
♪ MaxDot socks,
socks that rock. ♪

15:13.695 --> 15:14.957
What are you doing?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.959
Acknowledging my fans.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.136
You should get Bob to
do another commercial.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.572
No more commercials.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.793
Perhaps my face
on a bus bench.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.316
Or on a bus.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.623
My face works anywhere, really.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.494
Bob is busy enough.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.409
He is already never home.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.456
Can I tell you a secret?

15:35.499 --> 15:36.979
Of course.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.983
Late at night, alone in bed... Mm-hmm.

15:41.027 --> 15:44.421
I find myself wishing
that Bob...

15:44.465 --> 15:47.294
worked less.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.295
No.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.731
Yes.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.994
You would trade
money and success

15:52.038 --> 15:54.170
for more time
with your husband?

15:54.214 --> 15:55.955
I know, it is ridiculous.

15:58.696 --> 16:02.004
Don't worry, your
secret is safe with me.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.310
Thank you.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.312
Until we have a
falling-out, of course.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.357
Of course. Yeah. Mm.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.117
You made it out of your car.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.293
Barely. Sorry to wake you.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.034
It's okay. I wanted to see you.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.516
<i>Principles</i> <i>
of Geriatric Medicine.</i>

16:35.559 --> 16:37.561
How could you fall asleep
reading that?

16:39.215 --> 16:41.565
How was work?

16:41.609 --> 16:42.827
I'm sorry.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.351
How was your day?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.181
Hospital or mom?

16:49.747 --> 16:51.880
Got it. Mom.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.361
But it does not matter now.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.363
Yeah.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.757
This... this right here
is what got me through my day.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.543
Yes, now that you're here,
it does not matter

17:02.586 --> 17:05.067
that my mother has looked
into dual citizenship.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.378
It's okay. Everything is okay.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.772
It's perfect. Mm.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.607
- It is 8:00.
- I know.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.870
Our shift was over
two hours ago.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.916
- I know.
- When can we leave?

17:27.959 --> 17:29.352
I don't know!

17:31.311 --> 17:32.790
Look at that.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.619
The hum of activity
and the smell of fear.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.099
I love it.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.278
Well, we are down
to a Feeble Five.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.933
We can thank Bob for that.

17:44.976 --> 17:49.111
Why is it so much more effective
when Mr. Wheeler yells at them?

17:49.155 --> 17:51.200
Mm, they expect it
from you or me.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.810
Bob's a sweetheart.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.769
And now he's a monster.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.119
Our monster.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.252
Do you think he can
keep this up?

17:59.295 --> 18:01.123
Of course he can.
He's a Wheeler.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.430
- Ah.
- We work till we drop dead.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.040
It is what makes America great.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.389
