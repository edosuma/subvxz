Come on.
How's he doing?

00:15.760 --> 00:17.010
Stay with me, Malachy.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.010
Took the file.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.230
Don't. Don't speak.
Just rest. Don't.

Rose

00:25.100 --> 00:26.150
I love you.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.860
Always.

00:29.030 --> 00:29.980
Malachy?

00:31.690 --> 00:33.360
Jake.
Hurry!

00:44.460 --> 00:46.880
A little help!
A little help here!

00:54.090 --> 00:54.680
Malachy?

00:55.590 --> 00:55.970
He's gonna be okay.
Alright?

00:57.600 --> 01:00.220
That's more than I can say for
the fella who did this to him.

Well, um. He's still in surgery.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.510
And the only thing that
they would tell me

01:40.550 --> 01:42.470
is that the
bullet is lodged

01:43.180 --> 01:44.480
close to his heart.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.770
Do you have any idea who could
have done this?

01:48.480 --> 01:49.520
I don't know.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.360
I don't.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.740
But, your father
was working on a

01:54.780 --> 01:56.820
case he wouldn't
talk to me about.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.330
You know your father
never lies, But...

02:01.410 --> 02:02.580
But what, Rose?

02:04.490 --> 02:07.080
But, I saw him meet
someone in the bar.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.670
And I could just feel that there
was something really wrong.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.800
He was going on and on
about some file

02:12.840 --> 02:14.090
when he was in the
back of the car.

02:14.130 --> 02:15.630
Do you have any idea what he
was talking about?

02:15.670 --> 02:16.550
No.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.350
Whoever it was.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.350
Why would they wanna
shoot Dad?

02:24.140 --> 02:25.270
They want Malachy dead.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.440
If that's the case,
they might show up here

02:28.480 --> 02:29.900
and try
to finish the job.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.560
How is he?

02:32.440 --> 02:34.030
Well, he's still in surgery.

02:34.070 --> 02:34.570
We don't know yet.

02:36.150 --> 02:38.320
Look, Jake. I can't even begin
to think what you're feeling

02:38.360 --> 02:39.530
right now.
Are you okay?

02:39.570 --> 02:42.320
Well, we think that
whoever did this

02:42.370 --> 02:43.950
may have targeted
Dad specifically

02:43.990 --> 02:45.160
Can you do me a favor and get a

02:45.200 --> 02:47.080
guard on his door

02:47.580 --> 02:48.500
Sure.

We'll know soon honey.

02:53.130 --> 02:54.500
I can't believe this
is happening. The last thing

02:54.540 --> 02:56.130
I said to him is what do you
plan on wearing today?

02:56.170 --> 02:58.470
'Cause I didn't want our
outfits to clash.

02:59.630 --> 03:00.300
Okay. Everyone just relax.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.300
Father's too stubborn to let

03:02.340 --> 03:03.390
something like this
take him down.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.560
I'm gonna head back
to the house.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.520
And pick up a couple
of things.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.720
I'll come with you.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.730
Des. Stay here and,
you know, think about

Jake,

03:16.730 --> 03:19.240
I know you're actually going to
the office.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.950
To the crime scene, right?

03:20.990 --> 03:22.240
Just-- please be careful.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.660
- I will.
- There's an officer

03:23.700 --> 03:24.780
outside the
door already.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.740
And I know the cops have
combed the place.

03:26.790 --> 03:26.830
Don't worry.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.870
I know how to break into my
own office.

03:31.750 --> 03:32.630
He'll be okay.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.280
What's this?

04:04.780 --> 04:05.990
Where are the contents?

04:07.700 --> 04:08.410
Just--

04:09.000 --> 04:09.200
Take it easy.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.750
Who are you? And what
the hell are you doing here?

04:12.790 --> 04:15.380
Go ahead. Take your shot like
you did with Malachy.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.170
What?

04:17.210 --> 04:19.670
Malachy is my father.
What are you doing here?

Apologies for the--

04:22.840 --> 04:23.840
Head Hunting.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.180
First of all, shut up.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.220
There's a bunch of cops at the
bottom of the stairs.

04:28.260 --> 04:30.180
Second of all--
Answer my question.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.390
What are you doing here?

04:32.430 --> 04:33.980
I'm sorry about your father.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.350
We worked a case together
years ago.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.360
I'm an insurance adjuster.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.860
What does that have to do with
my father's shooting?

04:39.900 --> 04:41.400
I came to talk to Malachy.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.200
The thief we put away
twelve years ago?

04:43.240 --> 04:44.280
He just got out of prison.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.450
And he wants revenge.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.660
[Hood] You want an armed
officer over at the hospital?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.120
Please. As soon as
someone's available.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.500
Where are we to
with the shooter?

04:54.540 --> 04:56.120
Malachy was
shot at close range.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.580
We're trying to narrow
down the weapon.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.590
Forensics have been all over
the crime scene. Nothing.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.800
Maybe he knew the killer,
if the shooter got so close.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.720
- Where to now?
- Get Forensics back there.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.300
If they didn't find anything
the first time,

05:05.340 --> 05:06.300
they're gonna have
to try harder.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.220
Copy that.

05:10.260 --> 05:10.430
[Renee]
T.L. Fleming's Spruce.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.890
Estimated to be worth
four million dollars.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.650
This painting was stolen
twelve years ago?

05:16.690 --> 05:17.810
And never recovered.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.360
Though Malachy and Rose
caught the thief.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.030
You think this guy Nash, he's
the guy who shot my father.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.320
He was released a week ago.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.780
Since then, my apartment's
been broken into

05:25.820 --> 05:27.200
and my car's been shot up.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.370
For what? Revenge?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.330
Did you call the cops?

05:30.370 --> 05:31.410
No.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.080
Why not?

05:33.620 --> 05:34.540
Maybe--

05:36.540 --> 05:38.580
I hate to say this
with your father shot...

05:39.840 --> 05:40.800
Say what? What are
you talking about?

05:42.210 --> 05:44.340
My insurance company sent me
here to talk to Malachy.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.670
Since it's always
been suspected

05:45.720 --> 05:46.680
he may have been
working with Nash.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.590
You think that my father
is a thief.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.600
Are you out of your mind?
Have you ever met Malachy Doyle?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.810
I know. I never
thought he was guilty.

05:54.270 --> 05:54.890
But--

05:56.020 --> 05:58.150
- But--?
- All leads point to your dad.

05:59.230 --> 06:00.520
All leads. What leads?

06:00.560 --> 06:01.770
Mostly circumstantial.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.690
Fingerprints and fibers
that matched

06:03.730 --> 06:05.740
your dad's were
found at Nash's place.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.070
I'm just giving you
the facts of the case.

06:08.530 --> 06:11.280
We need to find Nash.
And get the truth out of him.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.410
How?

06:12.450 --> 06:13.540
I don't know.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.960
But whoever shot my father
wasn't just out for revenge.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.960
They took the contents
of this file.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.380
Maybe he's using it
to track down

06:23.420 --> 06:25.090
everyone who's responsible
for putting him in prison.

06:25.130 --> 06:25.670
Maybe.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.050
[muffled walkie talkie]

06:28.800 --> 06:30.470
It's the cops. Let's go.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.430
Watch your step.

06:49.150 --> 06:50.490
How long has it been?

06:50.530 --> 06:52.070
This is taking too much time.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.410
I should go in.
Maybe I can go in.

06:53.450 --> 06:56.370
I can help. I can hold
something, or something.

06:57.410 --> 07:00.670
Des, just-- try and relax,
okay.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.420
He's gonna be fine.
Just breathe.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.460
I know, I'm breathing,
I'm breathing b'y. It's just--

07:06.590 --> 07:08.470
Malachy's like a father
to me and--

07:08.510 --> 07:11.090
I just wish I could do
something. You know?

07:11.140 --> 07:12.640
He's gonna be okay.

07:13.970 --> 07:15.430
He's gonna be fine.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.020
Trust me.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.680
Thank you.

07:20.770 --> 07:21.900

Hey.

07:22.310 --> 07:23.230
Hey.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.570
Okay. He's stable.

07:25.730 --> 07:28.650
But he's not out of danger
yet. And...

07:28.690 --> 07:30.110
He hasn't regained
consciousness, but

07:30.150 --> 07:32.320
the doctors are
feeling really positive.

07:32.990 --> 07:34.160
[ringing]

07:37.830 --> 07:38.540
Hey Jake.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.210
Anything?

07:40.250 --> 07:41.830
Yeah, he's gonna make it.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.120
Thank God.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.210
Does the name Gilbert Nash
ring a bell?

07:44.790 --> 07:46.090
I know that name.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.800
He might be our guy. Just
check your phone.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.720
I sent you a photo
a few minutes ago.

07:51.090 --> 07:53.800
Oh no. This is the guy
Malachy met at the Duke.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.890
Malachy met with Nash?

07:54.930 --> 07:56.350
Who's this?

07:56.390 --> 07:59.100
Rose, it's Renee Johnstone.
I'm an insurance adjuster.

07:59.140 --> 08:00.480
Oh yeah. Renee.
I remember you.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.560
The T.L. Fleming painting.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.190
Do you remember any of the
details about that old case?

08:05.230 --> 08:08.150
Gosh, that was so long ago,
I'm drawing a blank.

08:08.190 --> 08:10.110
But you know, if I had my old
case files from the office...

08:10.150 --> 08:12.150
It's gonna be a bit of
a problem.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.700
Nash-- the guy convicted of
stealing the painting?

08:14.740 --> 08:16.580
He's got the file.
I think it's the

08:16.620 --> 08:17.990
one that Dad
was going on about.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.000
We're gonna have to rely on
your memory.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.370
No, wait.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.870
Yeah. A week ago,
Malachy had me create a

08:23.920 --> 08:26.170
digital backup for
some important file.

08:26.210 --> 08:28.050
- I think this was the case.
- This case?

08:28.090 --> 08:29.590
If I can get into the office--

08:29.630 --> 08:31.880
And I can get my tablet. Then
I can get a digital backup

08:31.920 --> 08:31.970
of this whole file.

08:33.550 --> 08:35.720
That's not gonna happen. The
cops are all over the place.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.890
Look. Just leave that to me.

08:36.930 --> 08:38.060
Okay, I got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

08:39.470 --> 08:41.520
And by a few, I mean one. But
I think I can do it.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.310
I'll go with him. Make sure he
doesn't get into any trouble.

08:44.350 --> 08:47.190
Okay be careful. Rose, take me
off speaker will you?

08:47.230 --> 08:48.150
[Rose] Sure.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.860
Hey. Done. What's...
What's going on?

08:52.900 --> 08:57.160
Listen. Renee says that the
insurance company

08:57.200 --> 09:00.910
thinks that Dad might
have been a part of the theft

09:00.950 --> 09:02.160
of the missing painting.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.410
That's ridiculous.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.830
I know. I just wanted
you to know.

09:04.870 --> 09:07.830
In case it came down the pike.
Listen, do me a favor.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.340
Look after Dad for me, okay?

09:09.920 --> 09:10.800
Always.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.600
[Renee]
The Spences--

09:19.640 --> 09:21.140
The original
owners of the painting.

09:21.180 --> 09:22.390
Seems they've
made a little more money

09:22.430 --> 09:23.600
since the last
time I saw them.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.890
They didn't own this
place before?

09:24.940 --> 09:27.060
The Oceanview Executive
Suites? No.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.980
They operated a small B&amp;B.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.150
Cozy and all. But nothing
close to this size.

09:31.190 --> 09:32.400
They're obviously no one staying

09:32.440 --> 09:33.740
here, with all these
renos going on.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.110
By the way, the wife's
name is Tilda.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.320
They still have their
taste in art.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.120
I gotta admit, it all
looks the same to me.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.410
This is actually some pretty
high quality stuff.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.040
Didn't take you for
an art lover.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.000
Well, you know
what they say.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.420
Don't judge a book

09:47.460 --> 09:48.540
by it's...
whatever.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.750
[Tilda] Back off!
I'm telling you.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.880
Did Nash beat us here?

09:54.460 --> 09:58.340
I said. You'll have your money
by the end of next week.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.060
Oh. Sorry. I had to cancel
a conference booking.

10:04.810 --> 10:05.230
Renovations.

10:06.390 --> 10:09.190
- How can I--
- Wedding. Next summer.

10:09.230 --> 10:10.400
Will the renos be
done by then?

10:10.440 --> 10:12.780
- Of course.
- Perfect. Right honey?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.280
Yeah. Best kind.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.450
If you book now,
the honeymoon suite is free.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.160
You have to see it.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.320
Try and stop us.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.370
What's the security like
around here?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.830
Hmmm. Odd question.

10:24.870 --> 10:26.330
No, no, we just want privacy
for our wedding, that's all.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.170
Well, my husband, Anthony
and I manage the place.

10:31.210 --> 10:32.420
It's pretty quiet.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.720
Renovations. We just have
to cut through here.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.100
You know, we could look
at this another time.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.520
How stupid do you think I am?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.690
Change your hair all you want,
Renee Johnstone--

10:53.730 --> 10:55.230
I'll still recognize you.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.240
This is just great.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.540
Oh man. It's the fuzz.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.960
The policeman. Woman.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.580
The officers of the law.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.210
Did I offend you,
or your people?

11:14.250 --> 11:15.670
Okay.
I'm just gonna ask them.

11:15.710 --> 11:16.840
See if they'll let me
in for a minute.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.590
No, Tinny. No.
You're a police officer.

11:18.630 --> 11:20.260
You can't get tangled
up in this.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.590
If you're caught sneaking around
a sealed off crime scene,

11:22.640 --> 11:23.720
you could be suspended.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.680
Or worse.
But I need a digital

11:25.720 --> 11:26.930
file to find Malachy's
shooter.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.980
- Des--
- Trust me.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.480
I have a plan.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.220
Good morning.
You know.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.760
I just wanna say--
You guys.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.350
You're doing a
heck of a job here.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.850
And I want a lawyer.

12:10.140 --> 12:11.020
Please.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.730
Thank you. Thank you.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.950
Come on hon,
you gotta wake up soon.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.120
I'm gonna head home and let
you two have some space.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.870
I could really use
the company.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.790
And I know for a fact,
Malachy would

12:30.830 --> 12:32.660
want one of his granddaughters
with him.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.420
I suppose I could stay.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.750
But I really could
use some air.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.300
I'll be five.
Do you want anything?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.380
No. I'm good.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.260
Still no guard
outside there, huh?

12:43.180 --> 12:44.140
No, not yet.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.470
I'm really sorry you're
dealing with this.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.060
I am.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.520
We're all dealing
with it, Sloan.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.690
He's gonna be just fine.

12:59.730 --> 13:00.860
Go get some air.

13:01.570 --> 13:01.900
And--

13:03.280 --> 13:05.450
Know that we'll be here for you
no matter what.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.460
You need to pull it
together, love.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.790
We need you.

13:20.170 --> 13:21.340
We all need you.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.550
- Rose Doyle?
- Who are you?

13:25.590 --> 13:29.350
Look, I'm sorry. My
name is Anthony Spence.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.390
- Anthony Spence...
- You remember me.

13:31.430 --> 13:32.680
Give me some I.D.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.850
Right now!

13:39.400 --> 13:40.320
Remind me.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.690
I had a painting
stolen years ago.

13:44.820 --> 13:45.950
- What's with the--
- With the knife?

13:45.990 --> 13:46.950
Yes, the knife.

13:46.990 --> 13:48.910
Look. I don't
wanna hurt anyone.

13:48.950 --> 13:50.580
It's really hard to believe
that right now.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.620
Whoever shot Malachy--

13:52.660 --> 13:53.950
They're
after me too.

13:59.580 --> 14:00.210
You're late.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.840
Well, it's nice to
see you too Sloan.

14:04.340 --> 14:04.380
No.

14:05.630 --> 14:07.970
You're looking great.
I guess it's true.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.140
You're doing pretty
good these days.

14:09.890 --> 14:10.260
That's so cute, Luke.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.720
Like, how you still believe
everything you hear.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.180
Look, I need some cash.

14:16.230 --> 14:16.690
Don't we all?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.480
Why do you need cash?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.020
That's none of your business.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.400
Okay, you make me come here. And
then you treat me like crap.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.440
Same old Sloan.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.440
Okay, wait.

14:27.150 --> 14:29.110
- A friend has a shipment.
- Of...?

14:29.160 --> 14:30.950
I tell you, and
you're in fifty-fifty.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.620
You provide the capital,
and I do the deal.

14:32.660 --> 14:33.580
The deal for what?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.080
Okay, designer knock off crap.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.290
We buy it.
Get rid of it,

14:37.330 --> 14:38.710
And we trickle the take-home.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.250
You've grown up.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.590
- How much do you need?
- Thirty.

14:44.340 --> 14:44.840
Thirty thousand?

14:45.840 --> 14:47.220
I don't have
that kind of cash.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.720
I know you don't.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.180
But your boss does.

14:50.470 --> 14:53.060
So I need you to set up
a meeting with Saul.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.310
Okay. First off,

14:54.930 --> 14:56.350
he's not my boss.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.770
And secondly,
it's Vic Saul.

14:58.810 --> 14:59.190
And trust me.

15:00.310 --> 15:02.770
You do not wanna
owe Vic Saul anything.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.980
You're such a wimp.

15:05.610 --> 15:06.440
You're so scared.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.490
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.280
But I guarantee you, he'll
wanna meet with you.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.290
The only way out is
by talking to me.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.130
You haven't changed
in twelve years.

15:26.170 --> 15:27.630
You're still a little
bit touched!

15:27.670 --> 15:30.630
Look. We're here to warn you
about Gilbert Nash.

15:30.670 --> 15:32.850
He's the guy who stole that
painting all those years ago.

15:33.470 --> 15:34.890
He's in prison.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.180
[Renee]
No. He's out.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.810
He shot Malachy,
and he's coming after us.

15:37.850 --> 15:38.930
All of us.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.230
All of us? Why would he
come after me?

15:41.270 --> 15:43.270
Revenge? I don't know.
Maybe you can tell me.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.900
[doorbell rings]

15:45.440 --> 15:47.070
Stay here.

15:49.150 --> 15:50.700
We gotta get the hell
out of here.

15:51.150 --> 15:51.950
[gunshot]

15:52.950 --> 15:53.990
[Renee]
That doesn't sound good.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.990
We gotta find a way outta here.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.500
Stand back,

16:04.000 --> 16:04.880
[crash]

16:08.590 --> 16:09.840
Want me to give you a boost?

16:10.550 --> 16:12.050
Or you can go first.

16:24.770 --> 16:25.690
Where's the painting?

16:25.730 --> 16:26.900
You stole it, like,

16:26.940 --> 16:27.820
a decade ago. How the
hell should I know?

16:28.900 --> 16:31.400
Lady, I spent a
long time in jail.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.740
And I spent every single
minute of it, on the inside.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.240
And I thought about
what I'd do to you

16:36.280 --> 16:37.450
and everyone who
put me there.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.370
So I'll ask you again.

16:39.410 --> 16:40.580
Slowly this time.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.290
Where is it?

16:42.750 --> 16:43.790
Now what?

16:43.830 --> 16:45.080
I don't have it.
I swear.

16:45.790 --> 16:46.630
Wait a few seconds.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.550
When you see me,
pull the fire alarm.

16:49.590 --> 16:51.880
[Nash] If you don't have it, and
the P.I. doesn't have it...

16:51.920 --> 16:53.130
Then the question remains.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.090
And guess what that is.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.180
Okay.
It could be--

16:56.220 --> 16:57.140
[alarm rings]

16:58.260 --> 16:58.970
[Nash]
Renee.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.140
Now I don't have to
hunt you down.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.320
I'm gonna do to you
what you did to my father.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.690
What are you talking about?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.030
You shot Malachy Doyle.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.250
Malachy? What are
you crazy?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.210
I didn't shoot him.
I was working with him.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.460
- What?
- I didn't do anything to him.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
- You're lying.
- Stop. Or I'll shoot.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.260
No, no, no.
Don't. Don't!

17:35.630 --> 17:37.090
Just don't---
Give me that.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.890
Nash is the only one
who could have shot your dad.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.440
Yeah. Well, he seems
to think that

17:45.480 --> 17:46.560
Tilda's got the painting.

17:47.350 --> 17:48.860
And until we get it back,

17:50.520 --> 17:52.230
we'll never know
who shot my father.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.160
[Tinny] He's an idiot.
It's my fault.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.160
But it won't happen again. Okay?

18:02.410 --> 18:02.740
Thank you.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.000
I just had to cover three
double shifts for him.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
There's too many,

18:08.790 --> 18:10.250
you know, officers
of the law up there.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.590
How many is too many?

18:11.630 --> 18:15.510
More than one. Less
than nine. I don't know. Ow!

18:16.420 --> 18:17.680
So that was your master plan?

18:17.720 --> 18:20.430
No. My master plan was more
of a bad idea.

18:20.470 --> 18:23.060
And that's really obvious
now. But, as they say,

18:23.100 --> 18:25.770
hindsight is twenty twenty.
So I'm gonna shut up now.

18:25.810 --> 18:27.430
How are we gonna get
Rose's old file?

18:27.480 --> 18:29.770
Oh I got it. I shoulda told you
that first. I realize that now.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.110
But your tablet.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.190
I made a copy.

18:33.650 --> 18:34.030
Oh. Good.

18:35.650 --> 18:39.610
Yeah. So you, uh, you think I'm
hot now that I'm a criminal?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.870
I mean, I know you're sworn to
fight crime. Tinny--

18:43.740 --> 18:45.200
[Jake] Why does Nash
seem to think

18:45.240 --> 18:46.000
that you have
the painting?

18:46.540 --> 18:47.910
How do I know.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.540
I think you know a lot more
than you're letting on.

18:50.290 --> 18:51.540
Don't feel like talking?

18:51.580 --> 18:53.040
Fine.
We'll just leave you here

18:53.090 --> 18:54.550
for Nash to come
back and question.

18:54.590 --> 18:56.960
I got a feeling next time he
won't be so gentle.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.220
Look at me. My father
is in the hospital dying.

19:00.260 --> 19:02.010
And I need to find out
who put him there.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.470
Okay, look. I can't prove
it or anything.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.600
But I've always thought
that Anthony--

19:06.640 --> 19:07.890
You think your husband...

19:08.690 --> 19:09.480
Stole his own painting.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.940
I don't know.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.570
All I know is that he was
acting very, very odd back then.

19:14.610 --> 19:15.940
When the painting
disappeared.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.320
How odd?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.650
I confronted him.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.160
And ultimately, that's why
we're getting a divorce.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.570
That and the fact that
he okay'd these

19:22.620 --> 19:24.740
renovations that are
putting us in debt.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.040
Oh, yeah, and I
supposed your charming

19:26.080 --> 19:28.330
personality has nothing
to do with the split.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.580
Where's Anthony now?

19:30.620 --> 19:32.580
He disappeared,
over a week ago.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.040
[beeping]

19:35.340 --> 19:35.840
Are you sure about that?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.680
Because I think I found
your husband.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.140
[Jake] Where's Nash?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.770
I don't know. And honestly,
I don't want to know.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.600
That's why I came here.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.520
I thought maybe we
could work together.

19:52.560 --> 19:52.600
Protect each other.

19:54.270 --> 19:57.070
Well, if we had the painting, we
might be able to stop all this.

19:57.110 --> 19:58.440
If I had the painting,
I would have

19:58.480 --> 20:00.240
divorced Tilda a long time ago.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.900
[Renee] What about the payout
from the insurance company?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.740
I seem to recall a pretty
hefty settlement.

20:03.780 --> 20:04.990
It's all long gone.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.290
So, this has nothing to do
with the painting?

20:07.580 --> 20:08.990
- How did you...?
- I took it off your wallet

20:09.040 --> 20:10.790
when I was checking your I.D.
What does it open?

20:10.830 --> 20:12.170
Just my safety deposit box.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.500
Barely anything
in it, you know.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.380
Birth certificates.
Stuff like that.

20:16.420 --> 20:18.340
Rose, why don't you
hold on to this

20:18.380 --> 20:19.880
until we know that we can
trust this tool?

20:20.550 --> 20:20.920
[Des]
I got it.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.510
The digital copy of Mal's
old case file.

20:23.550 --> 20:24.930
What's it say, Des?

20:24.970 --> 20:27.560
Well the painting belonged to
Tilda and Anthony Spence

20:27.600 --> 20:30.480
but was never recovered.
But the thief, Gilbert Nash--

20:30.520 --> 20:31.930
Nash was offered
a lighter sentence

20:31.980 --> 20:33.650
if he revealed where
he hid the painting.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.980
But he didn't take it.

20:35.020 --> 20:37.060
No. No, he refused.
Even when the judge

20:37.110 --> 20:38.030
threatened him with
a tougher sentence.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.400
Someone connected to all of this
is the one who shot Dad.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.990
[Renee]
If Nash came after Tilda,

20:44.030 --> 20:46.620
me, it doesn't take a genius to
figure out who's next.

20:47.280 --> 20:47.700
Me.

20:48.450 --> 20:49.040
[Jake]
Well, buddy.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.120
If Nash is coming
for you, great news.

20:53.870 --> 20:55.420
You just became bait.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.340
[Des] It doesn't make any sense.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.720
In Malachy's file...

21:03.510 --> 21:04.380
Forget it.

21:05.090 --> 21:05.140
What is it?

21:06.430 --> 21:09.260
It's just-- Nash was working
with someone.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.390
And nobody
knows who.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.930
What are you getting at?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.400
It couldn't be Malachy,
could it?

21:17.110 --> 21:17.150
No.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.070
I mean. Whoever it is,
probably has the painting.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.990
Yeah, see, but if
that was the case,

21:23.030 --> 21:24.860
wouldn't Nash go after
that person first.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.740
And Malachy was the first one
who was shot.

21:29.620 --> 21:33.410
Not if Nash didn't know
who his partner was.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.040
Like, what if he was hired by an

21:36.080 --> 21:38.000
anonymous party
to steal the painting?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.800
That makes so much sense.
Oh my God!

21:42.960 --> 21:45.800
You know, your smartness
somehow outweighs

21:45.840 --> 21:47.760
your massive amounts of hotness.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.180
Does that make you
feel lopsided?

21:51.720 --> 21:54.020
Just check and see if you can
find Nash's phone records.

21:54.060 --> 21:54.890
Okay.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.770
He didn't own a phone.

21:56.810 --> 21:57.310
So they must have used
pay phones.

21:58.400 --> 21:58.810
Probably to keep the
cops off him.

22:00.270 --> 22:01.940
But everyone else involved in
the case had a phone.

22:03.230 --> 22:04.490
Well, I can run their
phones at the station.

22:04.530 --> 22:05.990
See if anyone made
calls to pay phones.

22:06.030 --> 22:07.110
Yes b'y.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.080
What if he's here already?

22:19.540 --> 22:20.000
Listen.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.340
We've got eyes all
over the place.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.460
All the entrances
and exits, okay.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.670
He's not here. So sit tight.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.880
Are you sure he's
gonna be here?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.140
Nash is coming for you,
alright?

22:30.180 --> 22:31.470
He knows this is your
favorite bar.

22:32.260 --> 22:33.930
He's coming.
Trust me.

22:38.230 --> 22:39.150
What?

22:39.190 --> 22:39.940
What are you smiling at?

22:40.860 --> 22:41.440
You remind me of your father.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.520
You have the same
way about you

22:43.570 --> 22:45.320
when it comes to tracking
down a suspect.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.030
Like a dog with a bone.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.660
Okay. Sure.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.580
He's gonna be okay.

22:52.410 --> 22:53.620
And we're gonna find Nash.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.080
Is that him?

22:57.160 --> 22:57.910
What if he's here already?

22:59.080 --> 23:01.080
Just calm down, okay?
I'll handle this.

23:02.710 --> 23:03.880
Not good enough, Doyle.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.210
Great. Just--

23:06.260 --> 23:07.920
call the cops if
anything happens.

23:13.550 --> 23:16.890
False alarm.
Just a delivery guy.

23:18.310 --> 23:19.230
[man] Spence?

23:19.270 --> 23:20.520
- For me?
- Yeah. It's for you.

23:27.150 --> 23:28.320
Help me! Help!

23:29.150 --> 23:30.610
- Put me out.
- What?

23:30.650 --> 23:32.740
- Come on! Put me out
- You want me to put you out?

23:32.780 --> 23:33.780
- Come on!
- Tell me what you did

23:33.830 --> 23:34.830
with the painting.

23:34.870 --> 23:35.870
Nash!

23:35.910 --> 23:36.790
[crack]

23:44.920 --> 23:47.170
Explosive powder in
the envelope.

23:47.210 --> 23:49.380
I mean that's very, very
impressive.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.050
I'm gonna ask you
one more time:

23:51.840 --> 23:53.340
Did you shoot my father?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.890
No. I'd never hurt him.

23:54.930 --> 23:55.600
Are you the one
that was spreading

23:55.640 --> 23:56.970
that garbage around town

23:57.010 --> 23:59.270
that he was working with
you to steal that painting?

23:59.310 --> 24:03.310
What? No. Malachy's a good
man. He was helping me.

24:03.350 --> 24:03.610
Helping you do what?

24:04.900 --> 24:07.820
Find your anonymous
partner? Or the painting.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.490
When I heard he got
shot,

24:10.530 --> 24:13.030
I came to see him because
I thought I was next.

24:13.070 --> 24:16.540
I came after him and Tilda
to find out the truth.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.250
Call the cops.

24:24.460 --> 24:25.420
Are you okay?

24:25.460 --> 24:26.340
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

24:27.590 --> 24:29.590
If he didn't shoot your dad,
then who did?

24:31.970 --> 24:32.880
Renee!

24:37.560 --> 24:38.520
Son of a --

24:46.940 --> 24:47.820
Rose?

24:49.530 --> 24:50.400
Sloan?

24:52.740 --> 24:53.240
Where's--

24:54.610 --> 24:55.950
Jake and Tinny are out
chasing down the bad guys.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.580
- They're fine.
- I, I...

24:58.620 --> 25:00.620
Oh, oh. Take it easy
there young man.

25:00.660 --> 25:01.950
[Rose]
Oh. Thank God.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.670
I need to tell you something.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.630
Nash--

25:07.090 --> 25:08.040
The file.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.840
No, we know dear.
Nash shot you.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.880
Okay? Just rest. Jake's
about to catch--

25:11.920 --> 25:14.010
Nash didn't shoot me.
Renee did.

25:14.630 --> 25:15.930
- Who?
- Renee.

25:16.550 --> 25:17.100
She got the file.

25:17.890 --> 25:19.260
She wants the painting.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.060
I'll call Jake.

25:24.310 --> 25:26.190
Hey. You okay?

25:27.310 --> 25:29.150
Yeah. I'm great.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.280
Jake. He's awake.
Mal's awake.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.610
Thank God.

25:35.650 --> 25:37.740
Listen, I think Renee
is the shooter.

25:37.780 --> 25:39.120
I know. She might be
on her way there

25:39.160 --> 25:40.330
right now.

25:40.370 --> 25:42.370
Just get Dad out of there.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.500
I'm gonna protect him.
I promise you that.

25:47.040 --> 25:47.710
We have to go now.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.080
Renee's almost here.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.250
No, no, no. Leave me. You
both go. You're in danger.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.590
Yeah. That's not on.

25:52.630 --> 25:54.170
Just ignore him. It's the
drugs talking. Come on.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.430
We gotta get you outta here.

26:01.180 --> 26:03.470
It's a good outfit for you.
Very Hugh Hefner.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.810
As you know, the similarities
don't end there.

26:05.850 --> 26:07.730
Guys hurry.
Renee will be here any minute.

26:09.270 --> 26:11.320
There's a man in the
parking lot with a gun.

26:12.860 --> 26:13.740
Come on.

26:18.860 --> 26:20.240
Go through that door!
Go. Go!

26:20.660 --> 26:21.620
Rose!

26:22.490 --> 26:23.540
There's nowhere to run.

26:26.870 --> 26:27.750
Out of my way.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.130
Where's the painting?

26:33.170 --> 26:35.470
You've got a very charming way
of trying to get information.

26:35.510 --> 26:36.470
Really smooth.

26:39.470 --> 26:41.640
I want that painting,
Malachy. Be a good little

26:41.680 --> 26:43.510
private investigator
and find it for me.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.470
Or else.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.520
Let her go!

26:46.480 --> 26:47.440
Rose.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.480
Rose! Rose!

26:49.520 --> 26:50.440
Malachy?

26:51.310 --> 26:52.230
Malachy!

27:03.410 --> 27:04.620
What are you working on there?

27:04.660 --> 27:07.080
Oh, I'm just catching up on
some emails.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.620
You can't do that from
the hospital?

27:08.660 --> 27:10.120
You really shouldn't
be at work during

27:10.170 --> 27:10.960
a time like this.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.290
I needed to clear my head.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.800
Are you sure whatever
it is your working on

27:14.840 --> 27:16.590
has nothing to do
with Gilbert Nash?

27:17.340 --> 27:17.970
You're not in trouble.

27:19.010 --> 27:20.300
Tilda Spence went on
the record.

27:20.340 --> 27:21.260
Nash tried to
kill her.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.890
We found him tied to the bar.

27:22.930 --> 27:24.720
Do you have any idea how
that happened?

27:25.220 --> 27:25.260
Not really.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.310
Well, I got more uniforms
at the hospital.

27:28.350 --> 27:30.730
And Jake's not
telling me anything.

27:30.770 --> 27:31.190
I just wanna help.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.150
Think you can
help me get the phone logs

27:34.190 --> 27:35.570
from
twelve years ago?

27:35.610 --> 27:37.070
What? Why?

27:37.110 --> 27:38.490
Nash had a partner

27:38.530 --> 27:40.110
that helped him steal
the Spences painting.

27:40.150 --> 27:41.530
We gotta find out who.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.580
This is Sergeant Bennet.
I'm gonna need a few

27:51.620 --> 27:54.540
things from the archives.
Some old phone records.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.470
You know, you're
just a little too much

27:59.510 --> 28:00.800
like your uncle, sometimes.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.110
[Jake]
You okay?

28:14.150 --> 28:15.690
I'm just a bit freaked out

28:15.730 --> 28:16.770
that Malachy's in
the hospital

28:16.820 --> 28:18.610
and that Renee
missus kidnapped Rose.

28:18.650 --> 28:20.400
But. I could be okay.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.650
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.820
So what does Peewee
Herman have on Renee?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.830
Look, Renee is a ghost.

28:27.870 --> 28:28.330
Okay. I got nothing.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.210
The only way we're gonna be
able to get Rose is--

28:32.250 --> 28:34.040
We'll have to do an
exchange for the painting.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.000
How? Nash. We don't know
anything about

28:36.040 --> 28:37.670
Nash's partner.
And he's not talking.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.670
I know you told me
to wait outside.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.680
It's Renee.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.140
Hello, where are you?

28:47.930 --> 28:49.100
Put Malachy on the phone.

28:49.140 --> 28:50.930
Well, that's not
really possible.

28:50.970 --> 28:53.190
He's kinda out of it right
now, thanks to you.

28:53.230 --> 28:55.350
You have two hours to
find my painting.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.820
After that, Rose will be joining
your father in the hospital.

28:58.860 --> 28:59.940
How am I supposed
to do that?

29:00.990 --> 29:01.490
Hello?

29:02.610 --> 29:04.490
- We got two hours.
- [phone beeping]

29:04.530 --> 29:07.030
That's Tinny. She got a phone
log of everyone involved

29:07.070 --> 29:09.290
with the case. She got a name.
Nash's partner.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.250
Anthony Spence.

29:14.080 --> 29:14.790
You're Nash's partner?

29:16.250 --> 29:19.170
I, uh... I needed the money
to buy the hotel but...

29:20.510 --> 29:22.510
I didn't want to lose
the painting. I loved it.

29:22.550 --> 29:24.630
So you anonymously hired Nash

29:24.680 --> 29:26.340
to rob your own painting
from you.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.930
I had him drop it in a spot
for safekeeping.

29:28.970 --> 29:30.560
I'd sell it.
We'd split the money.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.810
He collected the
insurance money.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.810
Nash went to jail.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.690
Where is the painting now?

29:39.860 --> 29:41.480
I locked it in the safe
at the hotel.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.570
With our
pending divorce--

29:43.610 --> 29:44.740
Tilda, she has control of it.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.030
She changed the combination.

29:47.240 --> 29:47.990
Does Tilda know the
painting's in there?

29:49.240 --> 29:50.740
No. It's hidden in a locked
box in the safe.

29:51.450 --> 29:52.750
I have the only key.

29:52.790 --> 29:52.830
Had.

29:54.370 --> 29:56.830
I'm guessing it's the same one
the Rose took from you.

29:57.580 --> 29:58.000
I'll get the lock box.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.920
I'll figure out what I'm gonna
do about the key later.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.380
What about me?

30:05.630 --> 30:08.970
I suggest you get outta here
and get yourself a good lawyer.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.820
Hi. I'm looking for a room.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.030
[Tilda]
I'm sorry.

30:26.070 --> 30:27.490
We're closed
for renovation.

30:27.530 --> 30:29.780
I can check another hotel and
see if they have space.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.370
It's okay. I guess
I'll just

30:32.410 --> 30:34.660
wander around downtown
until I find something.

30:36.000 --> 30:36.660
Oh!

30:37.080 --> 30:37.250
Damn.

30:38.210 --> 30:40.170
- Cheap luggage.
- No worries.

30:40.210 --> 30:43.500
We'll get you packed up.
And on your way soon.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.590
There you go.

30:50.430 --> 30:51.430
Okay.

30:51.470 --> 30:51.890
Alright. Let's paint.

30:53.140 --> 30:56.640
And by paint, I mean
break into that safe.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.310
- Just hurry up, will ya?
- Okay. Alright.

30:58.350 --> 30:59.270
This looks pretty solid Des,
I don't know.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.900
Yeah, don't worry, okay?

31:00.940 --> 31:03.320
You know, I learned a lot in my
time with the Master Plumber.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.400
Come on!

31:04.440 --> 31:05.530
I know. I'm coming,
Hang on. Hang on.

31:06.650 --> 31:08.700
Okay. Now. It's got an
electronic lock.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.780
So, if we can override the CPU.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.120
Then we should be able
to break in.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.490
[beeping]

31:13.530 --> 31:14.410
See?

31:16.660 --> 31:17.960
That's pretty impressive.

31:18.000 --> 31:18.870
Thanks.

31:23.630 --> 31:25.460
This must be what Spence
was talking about.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.090
[Des]
A safe inside a safe.

31:27.130 --> 31:28.300
Maybe there's another
safe inside--

31:28.340 --> 31:30.840
Like one of those Russian
nesting dolls.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.140
I need you to run a check on
all Tilda's financials for me.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.220
Okay, why?

31:36.270 --> 31:37.310
Just call it a hunch.

31:37.350 --> 31:38.270
I'm gonna bring these
back to Renee.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.390
Okay. Cool.

31:39.430 --> 31:40.940
Should I close the door?
Maybe I should.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.520
Yes. And wipe everything
down for prints.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.160
Over here.

31:56.080 --> 31:56.990
It's about time.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.540
I want that
painting now.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.540
Relax. Jake always
comes through.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.170
He takes after his
father that way.

32:03.460 --> 32:04.750
[Renee]
Funny. I thought I asked

32:04.790 --> 32:06.130
for a painting.
Not a metal box.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.720
Just relax. I need the
key from Rose.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.010
Open it.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.810
And it's...

32:24.860 --> 32:26.070
A roll of paper towels.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.780
So now I have to shoot three
Doyles today.

32:35.830 --> 32:36.740
Or...

32:36.780 --> 32:37.870
I'll shoot Rose!

32:37.910 --> 32:39.290
Then you'll take me
seriously, maybe?

32:39.330 --> 32:42.160
No, no, no. Listen. You have
our full attention.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.250
Do you know I was demoted
because I couldn't recover

32:44.290 --> 32:46.040
the painting?
I lost everything.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.920
No promotions.
No bonuses. No pension.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.470
It took me years to get back to
my old position.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.550
You shot my father for your
retirement fund?

32:54.590 --> 32:56.050
Once Nash was out
of prison, it was only a

32:56.090 --> 32:57.600
matter of time before
he found the painting.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.060
Yeah, and then you wouldn't
get your payday.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.180
Shut up, Rose.
I will shoot you.

33:01.230 --> 33:03.100
Just--take it easy.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.020
I can still get you
the painting.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.020
- You had your chance.
- [ringing]

33:07.980 --> 33:10.030
Just let me answer
this call.

33:10.070 --> 33:10.610
And I'll be able to
get it for you.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.150
It doesn't cost you
anything to listen.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.660
Answer, with the speaker.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.030
Des, what do you got?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.990
Hey, it's like you thought.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.330
Tilda's bank records
show that she

33:21.370 --> 33:23.710
received a payment
from an art collector--

33:23.750 --> 33:26.170
two days ago. And it looks
like a deposit.

33:27.790 --> 33:29.340
Now, why else would
she have that?

33:29.380 --> 33:30.710
Tilda has the painting.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.090
Let Rose go.

33:32.130 --> 33:33.510
I'll go get it for you.

33:33.550 --> 33:34.760
Untie her.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.890
You okay?

33:43.480 --> 33:44.730
I'm going with you.

33:44.770 --> 33:45.810
We'll take my car.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.830
[Jake] Is the honeymoon
suite still available?

34:02.870 --> 34:04.370
You shouldn't have sent your
police friends home--

34:04.410 --> 34:05.000
just because Nash
was in custody.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.750
You're gonna need to give
Renee the painting.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.880
Otherwise, I'm gonna end up
with a bunch of new air holes.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.750
And this whole place will be
covered in my blood.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.840
I told you. I don't
know where it is.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.880
You sure you didn't
swap it out of the lock

34:16.930 --> 34:19.590
box for a roll of
paper towels, maybe.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.220
The lock box? No.
Anthony is the only one

34:21.260 --> 34:21.470
with a key to it.

34:22.930 --> 34:25.140
You jimmied the hinge. And
you took out the painting.

34:25.850 --> 34:27.270
If I had the painting,

34:27.310 --> 34:29.440
don't you think I'd use it
to get my hotel out of debt?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.820
You're about to. I know you
sold it to an art dealer.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.070
You said she had it.
If she sold it...

34:37.110 --> 34:40.370
Relax. It was just a deposit.
Wasn't it Tilda?

34:41.910 --> 34:45.290
The painting's still here.
Right where it's always been.

34:46.790 --> 34:48.750
This is quite a collection of
art you got going here.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.960
Quite beautiful, actually.

34:54.170 --> 34:56.130
Really nice frames.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.220
Except for this one.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.850
That's not the painting,
Jake.

35:01.470 --> 35:02.850
Maybe it isn't.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.270
Let's find out,
shall we?

35:12.230 --> 35:15.820
I gotta say. It's pretty
brazen to have it

35:15.860 --> 35:17.950
here hiding
in plain sight.

35:20.530 --> 35:21.820
Finally.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.030
Please don't let her take
it. Please!

35:23.080 --> 35:24.790
I need that to save
the hotel!

35:26.290 --> 35:28.960
Would you just please
knock it off, alright?

35:29.000 --> 35:32.080
Fine. Send me to jail. It's
not like I'll be there long.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.710
[Rose] Who says you're
going to jail?

35:33.750 --> 35:35.130
[Jake] Rose, what
are you doing?

35:35.170 --> 35:36.670
Did you really think
you could just shoot my husband

35:36.710 --> 35:38.010
and get away with it?

35:38.050 --> 35:39.430
Save it. You're not a killer.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.760
Would you shut up.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.560
Rose. Give me the gun.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.060
Malachy almost died.

35:47.100 --> 35:51.560
If you shoot her, you'll go to
jail for a very long time.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.770
It might be worth it.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.070
Okay, don't shoot, okay?

35:55.900 --> 35:57.150
I didn't plan to kill him.

35:57.190 --> 35:58.280
I couldn't risk him finding
the painting,

35:58.320 --> 35:59.700
But I didn't mean
to shoot him.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.610
I didn't plan on shooting
you either.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.990
- But now.
- Rose.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.210
I just wanted you to
see what it felt like.

36:13.420 --> 36:15.090
What it must have been
like for him.

36:23.970 --> 36:25.640
She was totally gonna
shoot you.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.650
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.320
How are you?

36:37.360 --> 36:38.400
I'm good.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.490
I'm really,
really good, actually.

36:40.820 --> 36:44.360
'Cause if this whole thing
made you, you know--

36:44.410 --> 36:45.740
Scared to sleep alone.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.170
What's this?

36:53.210 --> 36:54.420
That is...

36:54.460 --> 36:56.250
Are you asking me to
move in with you?

36:56.290 --> 36:58.750
Because it's a bit hard if you
haven't move in yet.

36:58.800 --> 37:04.430
No. That is a key to my trunk,
where I keep a lot of my things.

37:04.470 --> 37:06.510
So it's like a
symbolic gesture.

37:06.550 --> 37:07.510
But don't worry.

37:07.550 --> 37:08.640
You're gonna get a real one,

37:08.680 --> 37:09.310
As soon as I take possession.

37:10.220 --> 37:12.180
That's really something, Des.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.560
Now, having said that, do you
think that maybe we should tell

37:14.600 --> 37:16.190
Jake and Malachy
about the fact that

37:16.230 --> 37:19.690
we, you know,
make out and stuff.

37:19.730 --> 37:23.150
No? I'm thinking that's not
the right time for that.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.570
I'm thinking you're right.

37:24.610 --> 37:25.490
Okay.

37:36.370 --> 37:38.590
Do you know I almost shot
that woman tonight?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.260
If it wasn't for Jake,
you know, I might have.

37:42.590 --> 37:46.590
Well. I know you'd hold
up well in jail. But--

37:47.720 --> 37:49.850
I'm happy that you'll be
here with me.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.020
You think you'll
sleep tonight?

37:57.060 --> 37:59.440
Not if you keep leaning into
the bullet wound.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.440
Oh God! Sorry. Malachy!

38:03.570 --> 38:05.530
Please tell me I didn't
just walk in on

38:05.570 --> 38:07.200
something extremely
disgusting here.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.120
Yes please.

38:09.950 --> 38:12.580
Hey, why don't you and
I go for a little walk.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.370
Let these two fellas do
whatever it is they need to do.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.330
Lottie's?

38:16.370 --> 38:19.710
Ha ha, no. The closest you're
getting to a White Russian is

38:19.750 --> 38:21.250
the coffee machine
in the hallway

38:21.290 --> 38:22.710
here at the hospital. Let's go.

38:27.510 --> 38:29.220
You enjoying the vacation
here, Skipper?

38:29.260 --> 38:29.640
Some vacation.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.680
The only drink I've had has
been through the old I.V.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.730
I've got a prescription
for that.

38:37.770 --> 38:38.690
A small one.

38:38.730 --> 38:39.810
Sure.

38:42.440 --> 38:46.900
Well, this has been...
quite the ride.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.110
How many times have
you been shot?

38:49.070 --> 38:50.620
- This is the first.
- Wimp.

38:51.530 --> 38:51.950
I've been shot at least twice.

38:53.290 --> 38:56.540
I'm just smarter. This one
caught me off guard.

38:56.580 --> 38:59.290
Yeah, you are getting older
and slowing down a lot. So...

39:01.710 --> 39:03.340
But I'm sure glad you're okay.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.170
Me too.

39:13.970 --> 39:17.640
Things like this... kinda put

39:17.680 --> 39:20.020
things into perspective.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.480
Are you thinking of getting
another job on your own?

39:25.190 --> 39:26.780
That's a good idea.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.950
I'm being serious here.

39:28.780 --> 39:30.240
It's just that we people--

39:31.160 --> 39:33.530
We tend to think about things

39:34.660 --> 39:36.490
that we want, but we
can't necessarily

39:36.540 --> 39:38.040
have.
And sometimes these things

39:39.330 --> 39:41.290
were never actually there
in the first place.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.340
Why do I have the feeling

39:43.960 --> 39:45.920
that this "thing"

39:47.300 --> 39:50.260
has blonde hair and a badge.
With a killer smile.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.510
Maybe Leslie and I are just
a thing of the past.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.440
To the future.

40:01.770 --> 40:02.690
Cheers.

40:14.570 --> 40:17.450
So Luke.
This must be Sloan.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.660
Hi Sloan.

40:19.710 --> 40:19.870
Hi.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.840
Yeah. So I know it's
a lot of money,

40:24.880 --> 40:26.710
But you know me.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.800
Yeah, I know you, Luke. But I've
just met Sloan here.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.430
And I'd like to speak with her a
little, if that's okay with you.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.390
Yeah. Of course. I mean--

40:35.050 --> 40:36.180
You gotta do that.

40:37.930 --> 40:41.020
Okay. So--Are you gonna give
us the money or not?

40:42.060 --> 40:43.270
This generation.
Such impatience.

40:44.770 --> 40:47.780
I was just hoping that we'd get
it sometime this year.

40:48.940 --> 40:52.070
Ha. Well you got gall,
kid. I like that.

40:53.650 --> 40:56.740
But what you're asking-- I don't
usually deal with your type.

40:57.530 --> 40:57.870
Two reasons.

40:58.910 --> 41:00.290
One: You hardly ever
pay me back.

41:00.330 --> 41:01.500
- I'll pay you.
- And two:

41:02.960 --> 41:05.790
I hate punishing young girls
for not paying me back.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.460
But sometimes it has to be done.

41:09.670 --> 41:12.420
And whenever it has to be done,
we do it.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.510
Make no mistake.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.090
Reputation and all.

41:16.140 --> 41:16.800
Compassion is bad for business.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.770
But you're a smart kid.
You understand all that, right?

41:21.560 --> 41:22.890
Look. Maybe we should go.

41:22.930 --> 41:24.140
Somebody talking to you?

41:25.730 --> 41:27.110
Kent, were you talking to him?

41:27.730 --> 41:29.020
See? Nobody.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.240
Thirty thousand.
That's a lotta cash.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.160
What's it for?

41:36.780 --> 41:37.200
I just need it.

41:38.700 --> 41:40.870
Well Luke tells me you're
trying to move some of that--

41:41.620 --> 41:43.790
fake designer product.

41:43.830 --> 41:45.370
I gotta tell you that's
one big headache.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.960
Easy enough to bring it in.
But you gotta move it so fast.

41:50.000 --> 41:50.340
[Sloan]
Yeah. I know what I'm doing.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.840
This isn't something to piss
Mommy and Daddy off.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.970
It'll work. Because
I need it to.

41:58.050 --> 42:00.810
I think we're dealing with
a real professional here, Kent.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.270
How about this?

42:06.020 --> 42:07.440
You come work for me.

42:08.270 --> 42:09.730
You'll earn it in no time.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.070
Yeah. I'd rather just....

42:14.110 --> 42:15.360
I'm joking.

42:16.110 --> 42:17.280
See, I can be funny too.

42:17.870 --> 42:18.740
Heh, heh, heh.

42:19.910 --> 42:22.160
This is thirty thousand dollars.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.330
With interest, in three weeks,
you'll owe me forty thousand.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.750
You good at math?

42:27.330 --> 42:28.420
I'm pretty good.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.250
You better be.
