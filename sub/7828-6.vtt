00:03.580 --> 00:04.850
Hello, once again.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.434
As usual, I must warn you all that this
year's Halloween show is very scary...

00:10.649 --> 00:14.777
...and those of you with young children
may want to send them off to bed and...

00:14.945 --> 00:20.485
Oh, my. It seems the show is so scary,
Congress won't even let us show it.

00:20.659 --> 00:24.360
Instead they've suggested the 1947
classic Glenn Ford movie...

00:24.538 --> 00:26.329
...Two Hundred Miles to Oregon.

00:32.421 --> 00:34.829
There's nothing wrong
with your television set.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.332
Do not attempt to adjust your picture.

00:37.551 --> 00:39.591
We are controlling the transmission.

00:39.762 --> 00:41.505
What's that, boy? We're in control?

00:41.680 --> 00:44.218
Hey, look! I can see my voice!

00:49.897 --> 00:55.104
This is my voice on TV

00:55.277 --> 00:57.851
- Dad, you're ruining the mood!
- Sorry.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.862
For the next half-hour,
we will control what you see and hear.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.411
You are about to experience
the terror and foul horror of...

01:06.580 --> 01:09.581
...The Simpsons Halloween Special.

02:02.261 --> 02:05.961
Well, it was a long trip,
but we're almost there.

02:06.181 --> 02:09.265
Homer, did you remember to lock
the front door of the house?

02:11.770 --> 02:15.850
Well, it's been two long trips,
but we're finally almost there again.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.559
When you locked the front door,
did you remember to lock the back door?

02:23.657 --> 02:27.702
Oh, no! We left Grampa
back at the gas station!

02:29.121 --> 02:31.244
What about Grampa?

02:35.628 --> 02:36.956
- Hello!
- Hi!

02:37.129 --> 02:38.754
- We're here!
- Oh, goody.

02:38.922 --> 02:40.796
The sea monkeys I ordered
have arrived.

02:41.508 --> 02:43.382
Look at them cavort and caper.

02:43.594 --> 02:46.595
Sir, they're the new
winter caretakers for the lodge.

02:46.764 --> 02:50.970
Yes, they work hard
and they play hard.

02:50.309 --> 02:53.263
This house has quite a long
and colorful history.

02:53.437 --> 02:56.224
It was built on an ancient
Indian burial ground...

02:56.398 --> 03:00.147
...and was the setting of Satanic rituals,
witch burnings...

03:00.319 --> 03:03.154
...and five John Denver
Christmas specials.

03:04.114 --> 03:05.822
John Denver.

03:11.914 --> 03:15.746
That's odd. Usually the blood
gets off at the second floor.

03:22.257 --> 03:24.831
Hey, I found a shortcut
through your hedge maze.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.339
Why, you little...

03:26.512 --> 03:28.385
No, no. Go easy on the wee one.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.971
His father's gonna go crazy
and chop them all into haggis.

03:32.142 --> 03:33.423
What's haggis?

03:33.602 --> 03:37.101
Boy, you read my thoughts!
You've got the shinning.

03:37.314 --> 03:40.232
- You mean shining.
- You want to get sued?

03:40.401 --> 03:43.402
Now, look, boy,
if your da goes gaga...

03:43.570 --> 03:49.360
...you just use that shin of yours
to call me and I'll come a-running.

03:49.535 --> 03:52.655
But don't be reading my mind
between 4 and 5.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.158
That's Willie's time!

03:57.584 --> 04:01.368
Yes, by cutting off cable TV
and the beer supply...

04:01.547 --> 04:04.501
...I can ensure an honest winter's work
out of those lowlifes.

04:04.675 --> 04:07.711
Sir, did you ever stop to think
that maybe it was doing this...

04:07.886 --> 04:11.718
...that caused the previous caretakers
to go insane and murder their families?

04:11.890 --> 04:15.940
Perhaps. Tell you what, we come back
and everyone's slaughtered...

04:15.269 --> 04:16.644
...I owe you a Coke.

04:24.278 --> 04:27.113
Cable's out. Think I'll have a beer.

04:28.365 --> 04:30.737
Not a drop in the house.
What do you know.

04:30.909 --> 04:33.745
Homer, I'm impressed.
You're taking this quite well.

04:33.954 --> 04:35.746
I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!

04:35.956 --> 04:39.400
- Homer!
- Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry.

04:39.209 --> 04:41.700
There's plenty I can do
to keep myself occupied.

04:41.879 --> 04:44.168
Maybe I'll check out
that ax collection.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.131
See you later.

04:46.342 --> 04:48.490
Mom, is Dad gonna kill us?

04:48.218 --> 04:50.258
We're just gonna have to
wait and see.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.930
- So, what'll it be, Homer?
- Moe, give me a beer!

04:57.102 --> 04:59.120
No. Not unless you kill your family.

04:59.188 --> 05:01.264
Why should I kill my family?

05:01.482 --> 05:03.106
They'd be much happier as ghosts.

05:03.275 --> 05:06.609
- You don't look so happy.
- Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy.

05:07.196 --> 05:09.521
See? Now waste your family,
I'll give you a beer.

05:10.532 --> 05:13.652
Homer? Homie?

05:14.161 --> 05:16.996
What he's typed will be a window
into his madness.

05:21.877 --> 05:23.502
"Feeling fine."

05:23.712 --> 05:25.539
Wow, that's a relief.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.762
This is less encouraging.

05:42.815 --> 05:44.973
Well, what do you think, Marge?

05:45.234 --> 05:47.392
All I need is a title.

05:47.569 --> 05:49.479
I was thinking along the lines of...

05:49.655 --> 05:54.281
...No TV and No Beer Make Homer
something, something.

05:54.493 --> 05:55.904
Go Crazy?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.445
Don't mind if I do!

06:07.715 --> 06:09.292
Stay away from me, Homer!

06:09.466 --> 06:11.922
Give me the bat, Marge!
Give me the bat!

06:12.136 --> 06:14.342
Give me the bat! Come on.
Give me the bat.

06:14.513 --> 06:16.304
Give me the bat...

06:17.766 --> 06:19.593
Scaredy cat.

06:25.774 --> 06:28.526
You stay here till
you're no longer insane.

06:28.694 --> 06:30.733
Chili would be good tonight.

06:34.330 --> 06:36.720
Homer, it's Moe.

06:36.243 --> 06:38.948
Look, some of the ghouls and I
are a little concerned...

06:39.121 --> 06:42.288
...the project isn't moving forward.
- Can't murder now. Eating.

06:42.458 --> 06:46.123
- For crying out loud. Come on.
- No!

06:51.550 --> 06:53.507
Here's Johnny!

06:55.179 --> 06:58.345
David Letterman!

06:58.515 --> 07:01.351
Hi, David. I'm Grampa.

07:02.144 --> 07:05.150
I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer.
And I'm Ed Bradley.

07:05.189 --> 07:07.858
All this and Andy Rooney
tonight on 60 Minutes!

07:12.112 --> 07:14.690
Hello, police, this is Marge Simpson.

07:14.281 --> 07:16.902
My husband is on
a murderous rampage. Over.

07:17.117 --> 07:20.700
Well, thank God that's over.
I was worried there for a second.

07:20.913 --> 07:22.656
- No answer.
- Don't worry, Mom.

07:22.831 --> 07:26.781
I can use my shinning to call Willie.

07:29.296 --> 07:32.100
And that was the first time
she'd ever flown a plane.

07:32.966 --> 07:35.292
The little fat boy and his family
are in trouble.

07:35.761 --> 07:38.299
I'm coming to rescue the lot of you!

07:39.306 --> 07:43.900
All right, loony,
show me what you got.

07:43.268 --> 07:46.560
Is that the best you can do?

07:46.230 --> 07:49.314
Oh, my. I hope that rug
was Scotchgarded.

07:50.442 --> 07:53.313
Must kill family.

08:07.293 --> 08:09.962
- Had been given rifles,
but no ammunition.

08:10.254 --> 08:12.792
- Fortunately, there was a hardware store.
- Dad, look!

08:12.965 --> 08:16.168
Television! Teacher!
Mother! Secret lover.

08:16.468 --> 08:19.420
Urge to kill fading.

08:19.221 --> 08:21.794
Fading. Fading.

08:21.974 --> 08:24.263
Rising! Fading.

08:24.476 --> 08:27.394
Fading. Gone.

08:30.482 --> 08:33.482
Come, family.
Sit in the snow with Daddy...

08:33.652 --> 08:39.572
...and let us all bask in television's
warm, glowing, warming glow.

08:41.702 --> 08:44.489
Live from Broadway,
it's The Tony Awards.

08:44.663 --> 08:47.866
With your hosts,
Tyne Daly and Hal Linden.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.457
- Homer, change channel.
- Can't. Frozen.

08:54.965 --> 08:58.299
Urge to kill rising.

09:03.849 --> 09:06.550
You know, Marge,
I've had my share of troubles.

09:06.226 --> 09:08.349
But sitting here now
with you and the kids...

09:08.520 --> 09:11.355
...in our cozy home in this beautiful,
free country...

09:11.523 --> 09:15.473
...it just makes me feel
that I'm really a lucky guy.

09:15.694 --> 09:18.648
Dad, your hand is jammed
in the toaster!

09:18.906 --> 09:20.365
What?

09:23.243 --> 09:27.288
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off of me!

09:31.377 --> 09:33.850
Dad, it's in there again!

09:33.796 --> 09:36.417
No! It's stuck on my hand.

09:39.843 --> 09:44.173
This shouldn't be too hard to fix,
with the right tools.

09:49.603 --> 09:51.975
There. Better than new.

09:53.399 --> 09:56.269
Now, to take her for a test toast.

09:58.404 --> 09:59.779
What the...?

10:06.161 --> 10:07.572
Look at that.

10:07.746 --> 10:11.826
I'm the first non-Brazilian person
to travel backwards through time.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.792
Correction, Homer. You're the second.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.333
- That's right, Mr. Peabody.
- Quiet, you.

10:22.302 --> 10:28.920
I've gone back to the time when
dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.428
Okay, don't panic.

10:30.602 --> 10:33.853
Remember the advice your father
gave you on your wedding day.

10:34.230 --> 10:37.890
If you ever travel back in time,
don't step on anything.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.440
Because even the tiniest change...

10:40.612 --> 10:44.640
...can alter the future
in ways you can't imagine.

10:44.241 --> 10:48.191
Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still
and don't touch anything...

10:48.412 --> 10:51.164
...I won't destroy the future.

10:51.582 --> 10:54.333
Stupid bug! You go squish now!

10:55.544 --> 10:58.117
That was just one little
insignificant mosquito.

10:58.297 --> 11:00.455
That can't change the future, right?

11:01.800 --> 11:02.632
Right?

11:09.266 --> 11:10.844
I'm back.

11:14.980 --> 11:18.930
My loving family. Nothing's changed.

11:22.488 --> 11:24.611
Hidilly-ho, slave-a-reenos.

11:24.823 --> 11:26.567
Okilly-dokilly.

11:26.784 --> 11:30.912
Hey, what the hell is that geek
Flanders doing on TV?

11:31.789 --> 11:35.917
I see by the big board we got
a Negative Nelly in sector two.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.955
I'm gonna have to ask
the whole family to kind of freeze...

11:39.129 --> 11:40.921
...and prepare for re-Neducation.

11:41.256 --> 11:42.501
Don't you remember, Dad?

11:42.675 --> 11:45.462
Flanders is the unquestioned
lord and master of the world.

11:57.815 --> 12:01.433
Okay, everybody.
Let's see some big smiles.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.236
Just relax.
Let the hooks do their work.

12:08.330 --> 12:09.942
What the hell are you smiling at?

12:11.370 --> 12:13.861
Now, in case all that smiling
didn't cheer you up...

12:14.390 --> 12:16.320
...there's one thing that never fails:

12:16.208 --> 12:19.791
A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap,
and a total frontal lobotomy.

12:20.212 --> 12:21.956
It's not so bad, Homer.

12:22.172 --> 12:25.800
They go in through your nose...

12:25.175 --> 12:28.212
...and they let you keep
the piece of brain they cut out.

12:28.387 --> 12:30.712
Look. Hello.

12:30.889 --> 12:34.804
Hello there. Who's that big man there?
Who's that?

12:35.190 --> 12:37.640
- Join us, Father.
- Join us, Father.

12:37.855 --> 12:41.188
It's bliss.

12:42.484 --> 12:43.682
No!

12:49.783 --> 12:53.330
Oh, no. They're gaining on me.
Wait! I have an idea!

12:53.203 --> 12:56.952
These wieners will give me
the quick energy I need to escape!

13:00.669 --> 13:03.421
I gotta go back, fix future.

13:07.468 --> 13:09.756
This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.

13:13.265 --> 13:16.219
Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it.

13:18.145 --> 13:21.431
I wish, I wish
I hadn't killed that fish

13:28.113 --> 13:30.865
Hey, where is everybody?

13:33.535 --> 13:35.742
Hey, there's a bug that looks like Dad.

13:35.954 --> 13:38.310
- Let's kill it.
- Okay.

13:57.601 --> 13:59.724
This is gonna cost me.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.604
I mean, hey.

14:07.778 --> 14:10.351
Good morning, Father, dear.
Hope you're well.

14:10.531 --> 14:13.651
Are we taking the Lexus to
Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?

14:13.992 --> 14:18.405
Fabulous house, well-behaved kids,
sisters-in-law dead, luxury sedan...

14:19.390 --> 14:20.581
I hit the jackpot!

14:20.100 --> 14:24.582
Marge, dear, would you
kindly pass me a doughnut?

14:24.753 --> 14:26.627
Doughnut? What's a doughnut?

14:32.511 --> 14:33.886
It's raining again.

14:37.182 --> 14:39.508
You're still not in
your own world, Homer.

14:39.727 --> 14:43.724
I can get you home,
but you have to do exactly as I...

14:45.607 --> 14:48.692
This is indeed a disturbing universe.

14:49.653 --> 14:53.568
Don't touch anything?
I'll touch whatever I feel like!

15:05.210 --> 15:09.125
Foolish earthling, totally unprepared
for the effects of time travel.

15:22.394 --> 15:25.160
- What happened to us, Kodos?
- Quiet, you.

15:33.822 --> 15:35.400
- Good morning.
- What's my name?

15:35.574 --> 15:38.824
What color is the sky?
What of doughnuts? What?

15:38.994 --> 15:41.201
For the love of God, tell me!

15:41.372 --> 15:46.800
Homer, the sky is blue, doughnuts are
plentiful, Friday is TGIF night on ABC.

15:46.251 --> 15:47.876
- What's gotten into you?
- Nothing.

15:48.450 --> 15:50.666
Nothing at all. Let's just eat.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.805
Close enough.

16:08.607 --> 16:11.312
Hey, everybody!
Let's all turn our desks backwards...

16:11.485 --> 16:13.394
...before Mrs. Krabappel shows up.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.650
- Yeah!
- Great idea!

16:19.618 --> 16:22.904
All right, backwards boy,
back your butt down to detention.

16:25.374 --> 16:26.572
Over here, Simpson.

16:26.750 --> 16:30.250
The detention room is overcrowded,
so you'll be serving in the cafeteria.

16:30.421 --> 16:31.701
Oxygen running out.

16:31.880 --> 16:35.470
You should've thought of that
before you made that paper airplane.

16:36.677 --> 16:39.168
This overcrowding in detention
is becoming critical.

16:39.346 --> 16:42.596
It's a powder keg waiting to go off
in an explosion of bad behavior.

16:42.766 --> 16:44.474
Don't bitch to me, boss man.

16:44.643 --> 16:47.763
Thanks to the latest budget cuts,
I'm down to using Grade F meat.

16:49.815 --> 16:53.350
It would be wonderful if there was a
common solution to both our problems.

16:53.527 --> 16:56.611
- That would be great.
- Hey, Bart. Watch this.

16:58.407 --> 17:01.760
Oh, no! My favorite outfit!

17:01.243 --> 17:04.577
Jimbo, this is by far the worst...

17:08.208 --> 17:12.123
Jimbo, why don't you assist
Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen?

17:12.296 --> 17:14.916
- Bite me, Skinner.
- Well, might we.

17:15.214 --> 17:17.374
It's hard for me
to clean this giant pot...

17:17.550 --> 17:21.200
...when you keep spilling
meat tenderizer all over me.

17:21.180 --> 17:24.880
Oh, great!
Now I gotta work in the dark.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.936
This sandwich tastes
so young and impudent.

17:33.525 --> 17:35.601
Seymour, what's with the good grub?

17:35.778 --> 17:38.482
Well, perhaps I ought to
let you folks in on a secret.

17:38.656 --> 17:42.321
You remember me telling Jimbo Jones
that I'd make something of him one day?

17:43.410 --> 17:45.486
Are you saying you killed Jimbo...

17:45.662 --> 17:48.782
...processed his carcass,
and served him for lunch?

17:55.756 --> 17:57.380
I wonder where Jimbo is today.

17:57.591 --> 18:00.343
He should've beaten us up
for our lunch money an hour ago.

18:00.511 --> 18:03.962
Frau Lunchlady, please to have
another Sloppy Jimbo?

18:05.349 --> 18:09.347
That's your third helping, young man.
It's making you fat and soft...

18:10.104 --> 18:11.847
...and tender.

18:13.148 --> 18:14.940
You just cut in line, didn't you?

18:15.109 --> 18:17.647
- Report to detention, Uter.
- For how long?

18:17.861 --> 18:20.317
About seven minutes a pound
should do it.

18:24.326 --> 18:27.327
Okay, I got your German grub right here.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.126
Bart, does it strike you as odd
that Uter disappeared...

18:32.292 --> 18:35.827
...and suddenly they're serving us this
mysterious food called "Uterbraten"?

18:36.460 --> 18:37.375
Oh, relax, kids.

18:37.548 --> 18:40.999
I've got a gut feeling
Uter's around here somewhere.

18:42.177 --> 18:45.677
After all, isn't there
a little Uter in all of us?

18:49.590 --> 18:52.309
In fact, you might even say
we just ate Uter...

18:52.479 --> 18:55.931
...and he's in our stomachs
right now!

18:58.260 --> 18:59.818
Wait, scratch that one.

19:00.290 --> 19:01.820
Mom! Mom! You've gotta help!

19:01.989 --> 19:04.444
They're cooking kids
in the school cafeteria!

19:04.658 --> 19:06.984
Listen, kids,
you're 8 and 10 years old now.

19:07.161 --> 19:09.996
- I can't fight all your battles for you.
- But, Mom!

19:10.205 --> 19:12.993
No buts. You march
right back to that school...

19:13.167 --> 19:16.286
...look them straight in the eye
and say, "Don't eat me."

19:16.462 --> 19:18.390
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:22.593 --> 19:26.293
Since so many students have been
put on permanent detention...

19:27.431 --> 19:29.756
...we've merged everyone
into a single class.

19:29.933 --> 19:32.887
I trust there are no objections?

19:39.860 --> 19:41.235
Detention.

19:52.289 --> 19:57.746
Hey, you guys, I was just thinking
that any one of us could be next.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.837
So, what do you say
we make a break for it?

20:12.184 --> 20:15.434
Easy there, young man. You'll only
make yourself tired and stringy.

20:15.604 --> 20:18.274
Now to check on
the free-range children.

20:23.988 --> 20:25.316
Hold on, kids!

20:25.489 --> 20:28.823
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you! I'll...

20:29.994 --> 20:31.571
I'm bad at this.

20:35.749 --> 20:39.533
I'm going to enjoy devouring you,
Bart Simpson.

20:39.712 --> 20:44.208
Yes, I believe I'll start
as you've so often suggested...

20:44.383 --> 20:47.520
...by eating your shorts.

21:00.399 --> 21:04.170
Don't worry, guys. Something
always comes along to save us.

21:06.322 --> 21:08.148
Nevertheless, I remain confident...

21:08.324 --> 21:11.609
...that something will come along
and save the two Simpson children.

21:17.708 --> 21:21.373
Relax, honey. You were just
having a crazy nightmare.

21:21.587 --> 21:25.170
You're back with your family now,
where there's nothing to be afraid of...

21:25.340 --> 21:28.176
...except that fog
that turns people inside out.

21:29.678 --> 21:31.338
It's seeping in.

21:31.930 --> 21:33.590
Stupid, cheap weather stripping!

21:44.526 --> 21:47.978
One chorus line of people

21:48.197 --> 21:51.566
Dancing till they make us stop

21:51.784 --> 21:53.492
Two!

21:53.911 --> 21:58.822
Many dancing people
Covered with blood, gore and glop

21:59.166 --> 22:05.667
Just one sniff of that fog
And you're inside out

22:06.965 --> 22:13.170
It's worse than that flesh-eating virus
You've read about

22:14.265 --> 22:17.301
Vital organs
They are what we're dressed in

22:17.476 --> 22:21.426
The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine

22:21.647 --> 22:27.899
Happy Halloween

22:49.299 --> 22:51.375
