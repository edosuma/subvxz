Oh, brother Reed,
you have messed up my afro.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.649
All right, don't worry, bro.

09:43.649 --> 09:46.552
Just be cool
and let me handle this.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.354
All right, Jake?

09:48.354 --> 09:49.855
Jake?

09:49.855 --> 09:52.356
Jake!

09:52.356 --> 09:53.757
Oh, no.

09:53.758 --> 09:56.295
Oh, baby.
Oh!

09:56.294 --> 09:57.629
Oh, no.

09:57.629 --> 10:00.265
Oh! Oh, my grill.

10:00.265 --> 10:02.600
Oh, Black Beauty, oh.
Oh!

10:02.600 --> 10:03.936
Oh!

10:03.936 --> 10:05.503
See, when I left
school today

10:05.503 --> 10:07.439
I didn't think I was going
to run into you this summer.

10:07.438 --> 10:09.240
Or I didn't think you
was going to run into me.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.675
I mean, just <i>run</i>
into me like this.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.377
You're in trouble
with me, young man.

10:12.376 --> 10:13.444
You're in trouble
with me!

10:13.445 --> 10:14.813
No, listen, Mr. Wheat,
listen.

10:14.812 --> 10:15.947
It wasn't my fault.

10:15.947 --> 10:17.515
See, this nut
on some roller blades,

10:17.515 --> 10:19.718
he skated into my vision sight,
and I couldn't

10:19.719 --> 10:20.951
see nothing,
so I swerved...

10:20.951 --> 10:22.187
Roller blades?
Roller blades?!

10:22.187 --> 10:23.188
And we was spinning
around like that...

10:23.188 --> 10:24.423
I don't want
to hear it!

10:24.423 --> 10:25.990
...and then
I couldn't control it...

10:25.990 --> 10:27.192
I don't want to hear it.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.927
Know how much
that car cost me?

10:28.927 --> 10:29.927
No.

10:29.927 --> 10:31.062
Do you know?

10:29.927 --> 10:31.062
No.

10:31.062 --> 10:32.463
That's a $22,000 car.

10:32.464 --> 10:33.599
$22,000!

10:33.599 --> 10:35.100
And that's just
the base price!

10:35.100 --> 10:36.302
Check out
the chrome, see?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.735
I waited four weeks
for the chrome!

10:37.735 --> 10:39.638
You can't get chrome
wheels at base price!

10:39.638 --> 10:40.906
See that leather?

10:40.905 --> 10:43.307
That's Detroit leather.
That's Detroit leather.

10:43.307 --> 10:46.010
You got to order Detroit
leather from Detroit!

10:46.010 --> 10:47.344
Huh? What's that tell you?

10:47.345 --> 10:51.182
They always get you
with them extras.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.786
Give me your
driver's license.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.021
Um...

10:56.020 --> 10:57.555
Give me your
driver's license.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.490
Um, regarding my
driver's license,

10:59.490 --> 11:02.461
I'd give it to you, but
you're going to have to wait.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.562
For what?

11:03.562 --> 11:04.895
Oh, about a year.

11:04.895 --> 11:05.963
Oh, no.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.666
That-that's when
I get one.

11:07.666 --> 11:08.801
No, no...

11:08.801 --> 11:10.302
When they
put it in my hand.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.769
You don't have
a driver's license?

11:10.302 --> 11:11.769
No.

no insurance, do you?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.339
I guess...

11:14.339 --> 11:15.607
I hate to do this,
young man.

11:15.606 --> 11:17.241
I hate to put a
black man in jail,

11:17.241 --> 11:18.142
but I'm going to have
to call the police.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.478
Black man in jail?

11:23.014 --> 11:24.350
No, please, don't call them.
Don't call them.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.617
Please, don't call
the police!

11:25.616 --> 11:26.951

I was driving

let me fix it, please.

have been driving.

11:32.123 --> 11:34.493
No, let me fix it.
Let me fix it!

11:35.693 --> 11:36.728

11:37.729 --> 11:39.297
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.066
Yeah, I'll let you
fix the car.

it's going to cost to fix?

11:49.841 --> 11:51.909
I don't have $1,900.

11:51.909 --> 11:53.044
That's all right.

11:53.044 --> 11:54.579

will help you out.

Ooh, oh, um, wait.
I'll get the money.

Most of them started

That's when my dad left me

I saw my Dad.

38:07.951 --> 38:09.351
I was seven years old,

38:09.351 --> 38:12.722
and for no reason at all,
he bought me this yo-yo.

38:12.722 --> 38:14.858
It was so cool.

38:14.858 --> 38:17.460
I mean, it wasn't
just an ordinary yo-yo.

38:17.460 --> 38:20.530
It had lights that lit up
when you yo-yoed it.

38:20.530 --> 38:24.168
Red lights on one side,
and blue lights on the other.

38:24.168 --> 38:27.403
And it made this funky,
whistling noise, too.

38:27.403 --> 38:28.606
Wow.

38:28.606 --> 38:30.540
That sounds
like quite a yo-yo.

You-you still got it?

38:32.009 --> 38:33.809
No.

38:33.809 --> 38:36.146
After awhile,
it stopped lighting up.

38:36.146 --> 38:39.282
Then it quit making that funky
whistling noise.

38:39.282 --> 38:42.853
Then I guess
my mom just threw it away.

38:45.755 --> 38:47.990
