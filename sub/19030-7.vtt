WEBVTT

00:06.473 --> 00:07.872
Dr. Dorian?

00:07.907 --> 00:09.238
Katie, we've been over this.

00:09.275 --> 00:12.472
It's inappropriate to interrupt
an attending while he's hitting that.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.377
Particularly while he's hitting it good.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.814
<i>J.D.: Turk and I used Katie</i>
<i>as a messenger service.</i>

00:16.850 --> 00:18.943
Dr. Turk liked the drawing
you had me take him.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.351
He had never seen himself
as a deep-sea diver before.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.652
Awesome! Go back and say,
"J.D. Says you're welcome.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.884
"And here's a little something
for your bottom."

00:26.059 --> 00:27.117
And he wanted me to ask you

00:27.160 --> 00:28.957
if you wanted to go to
the batting cages after work.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.555
Remind him I don't like to do
things that I'm not good at.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.589
Yeah, that's why
we don't have sex much.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.125
That hurt me so much,
I lost my breath a little.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.331
Ooh. Barbara, can you please
put Mrs. Newell

00:39.372 --> 00:41.306
on 150 milligrams of Clindamycin?

00:41.341 --> 00:43.241
Can't we use Azithromycin instead?

00:43.276 --> 00:45.437
That way she only requires
one dose instead of four

00:45.478 --> 00:47.412
and I won't have to be
running around all day.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.709
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.613
<i>J.D.: Elliot didn't think</i>
<i>it was interesting,</i>

00:50.650 --> 00:52.641
<i>so they went to the person</i>
<i>who settled all disputes</i>

00:52.685 --> 00:54.118
<i>between nurses and physicians.</i>

00:54.154 --> 00:56.714
Okay, I'm glad you guys
didn't let this escalate.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.451
Elliot, I bet you didn't know
that on weekends,

00:58.491 --> 01:01.255
Barbara was a
semi-professional kick-boxer.

01:01.294 --> 01:02.386
I did not.

01:02.429 --> 01:06.661
Still, doctors decide all prescription
orders and you know that.

01:12.705 --> 01:15.265
Oh, my God,
did she just kick that ceiling tile?

01:15.308 --> 01:17.071
Yeah. She's really good.

01:18.044 --> 01:20.342
Well, about time, Champ. Beer me.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.144
No problem. Just remember our deal.
I bring the beer

01:23.183 --> 01:27.119
and you don't tell anybody that
we are now spending time together.

01:27.487 --> 01:31.651
You're the new Chief, I'm the old Chief.
Who better to guide you through it?

01:31.691 --> 01:33.022
I'm just gonna hit the floor
and be a doctor,

01:33.059 --> 01:34.583
like I have my entire career.

01:34.627 --> 01:37.425
Well, you can kiss that idea goodbye.

01:37.464 --> 01:41.696
I spent so much time behind that desk
dealing with red tape,

01:41.734 --> 01:44.601
my behind still has
the imprint of the chair.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.563
You want to see?
Since we're friends now,

01:46.606 --> 01:47.834
I can show you my butt.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.341
Bob, I saw it five years ago

01:49.375 --> 01:51.570
at Nurse Roberts'
above-ground pool party

01:51.611 --> 01:53.704
and I am still recovering.
Honest to God,

01:53.746 --> 01:57.614
there are times when I close my eyes
and it's just there.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.479
That still doesn't change the fact

01:59.519 --> 02:02.784
that you are going to spend most of
your day trapped in that office.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.120
Look, there are a few key
differences between us.

02:05.158 --> 02:09.458
For instance, I know that white leather
shoes are never gonna be classy.

02:09.496 --> 02:13.364
I believe that a yard should have trees,
not gay little angel fountains.

02:13.399 --> 02:17.028
And I'm damn sure not gonna be
stuck in my office all day long.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.836
Enid picked out the damn fountains.
I don't even like them.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.671
- Bob?
- Fine.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.169
I like to pretend that
they're friendly stone people.

02:26.212 --> 02:30.273
All right, I'm partial to the one with
tiny wings and the flowers in her hair.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.216
- That's Leslie.
- Well...

02:34.287 --> 02:36.812
Dr. Turk wanted me to give you this.

02:36.856 --> 02:38.221
I warned you about abusing interns.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.885
That better not be
another stupid drawing.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.520
Elliot, please. Turk just wanted me
to look up a study about

02:42.562 --> 02:46.123
intra-operative beta-blockades to
prevent post-operative complications.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.895
- Really?
- No.

02:47.934 --> 02:51.495
He took a picture of me and
Photoshopped on cactus hands.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.802
Look at me,
I can't touch anything I love

02:53.840 --> 02:55.501
without hurting it.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.335
Do not do him
any more personal favors.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.404
- Okay.
- All right, let me have it.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.539
What are you talking about?

03:02.582 --> 03:06.416
It is my first official day
as Chief of Medicine,

03:06.452 --> 03:10.684
and I'm sure you've set up some
elaborate, annoying spectacle.

03:10.723 --> 03:11.917
I didn't do anything.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.155
I suppose that giant cake
has nothing to do with me?

03:15.195 --> 03:18.130
No, that's 'cause Colonel Doctor
has two years sober.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.630
Please, just go ahead
and do whatever it is you're gonna do

03:24.671 --> 03:26.434
so I might get to work.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.834
<i>J.D.: Come on, think of something.</i>

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.621 --> 04:18.317
That was actually pretty impressive
there, Newbie. Thank you for that.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.848
You're welcome, Perry.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.757
<i>J.D.: How lucky was that?</i>

04:24.230 --> 04:25.822
Why are you playing bongos?

04:25.865 --> 04:28.163
It's Monday. Monday is bongo day.

04:29.636 --> 04:33.072
<i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

04:33.106 --> 04:34.733
<i>No, I know</i>

04:34.774 --> 04:36.366
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

04:39.946 --> 04:41.709
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

04:45.585 --> 04:48.179
I just had to come see it for myself.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.451
You are the Chief of Medicine.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.548
I know.

04:51.591 --> 04:55.550
It is great to see someone
other than Kelso behind that desk.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.687
Ted!

04:56.729 --> 05:00.495
This is the first time
I've been allowed to use the couch.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.728
Dr. Kelso always made me stand.

05:02.769 --> 05:06.933
Even when I had
thigh reconstruction surgery.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.334
His dog Baxter ate
the lower half of my hamstring.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.902
Oh, yeah, that was gross.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.176
Go ahead
and make yourself comfortable, pal.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.011
So I hope you don't mind
my barging in.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.520
You got to be kidding me. In fact, Ted,

05:21.554 --> 05:25.513
go ahead and put Carla
on the "Always allowed in" list.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.116
You got it.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.587
Too comfortable, Ted.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.688
Thanks, sir. I need boundaries.

05:31.731 --> 05:36.464
So, you have a list of
who can and can't come in here?

05:36.502 --> 05:40.768
There's the "Always allowed in" list,
the "Sometimes allowed in" list,

05:40.807 --> 05:46.006
and the "Never, ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever" list.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.576
Who's on the
"Never, ever, ever, ever, ever"?

05:49.048 --> 05:51.608
Dr. Dorian at your service.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.416
How was your weekend, Howie?

05:53.453 --> 05:56.354
Well, I bought some new soap,
but it turns out I was allergic to it.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.949
I tried to get a refund,
but I lost my receipt.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.925
I was hoping you'd just say "fine."

06:00.960 --> 06:03.724
Okay, let's start rounds over here.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.755
Mr. Vaughn, how are you today, sir?

06:06.799 --> 06:10.235
Pretty good, but could you have
the maid send some fresh towels?

06:10.269 --> 06:12.601
Mr. Vaughn has pneumonia.

06:12.638 --> 06:14.868
It was touch and go there for a while,
but you're bouncing back.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.204
You're gonna be out of here
any day now.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.607
I hope not.

06:17.643 --> 06:20.305
It's nice being with people for a change.

06:20.346 --> 06:21.973
We like having you around, too, sir.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.505
If you need anything, you let us know.

06:27.253 --> 06:30.586
- What the hell is that?
- Some stupid gift from the Board.

06:30.623 --> 06:34.059
It's a photo of Sacred Heart
when it first opened in 1884.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.685
There's a hybrid
in the parking lot.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.492
I might have the date wrong.
So where do you want me to hang it?

06:38.531 --> 06:39.964
Somebody else's office.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.967
Are you trying to stop me
from doing my job?

06:42.001 --> 06:43.559
How would you feel if I tried to stop you

06:43.603 --> 06:46.094
from taking patients' wallets
after they died?

06:46.139 --> 06:47.367
Doctors don't do that.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.637
Look at you, sticking with the plan.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.643
Just put it someplace, will you?

06:51.677 --> 06:54.305
- Well, I got to go.
- I'll go with you.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.838
- Chiefs can do that?
- I don't wanna stay in here all day.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.852
I wanna get out and see people,
check on patients,

06:59.886 --> 07:02.081
maybe make an intern cry.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.818
Actually, Dr. Cox, you need to
look over the JAYCO paperwork

07:05.858 --> 07:08.725
and these nursing
home transfer requests.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.353
See you later.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.392
What are you doing there, Ted?

07:14.434 --> 07:18.336
Dr. Kelso always used to
sign his paperwork on my back.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.505
It's not so bad.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.805
I imagine it's what a hug feels like.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.872
- Is it?
- I'm not gonna hug you, Ted.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.251
Hey, Carla,
next time you hang with Dr. Cox,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.719
maybe instead of
braiding each other's hair

07:34.754 --> 07:36.585
you could talk to him
about making some new hires

07:36.622 --> 07:39.056
so we don't have to work
forced overtime.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.417
Why is Nelly giving you
so much attitude?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.260
Even though I'm the head nurse,
I mostly hang with doctors.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.165
I'm married to a doctor,
my best friend is a doctor.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.567
- Who's your best friend?
- You are.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.901
I know. I just wanted to
hear you say it out loud.

07:52.939 --> 07:56.898
The point is, nurses sometimes think
I'm on the wrong team.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.844
How could they think that? You're,
like, the most loyal person I know.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.712
Except for the time that you booed me
off the stage at the karaoke bar.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.717
Elliot, you're not allowed to sing
<i>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.</i>

08:05.751 --> 08:07.218
I just can't hit those low notes.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.948
Sure, that's why.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.850
Look, most nurses
feel under-appreciated,

08:11.891 --> 08:13.654
especially by doctors.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.456
It's not that bad here, is it?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.430
You know what the MD at
the end of this badge means?

08:18.464 --> 08:20.557
It means, I make the decisions.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.227
You got that, missy?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.302
I'll see you at home.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.739
And sometimes,
it's not even that subtle.

08:29.942 --> 08:33.571
My post-op patient is still going in
and out of consciousness.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.808
You know what I'd like to go
in and out of?

08:35.847 --> 08:37.975
Disrespecting nurses five!

08:40.019 --> 08:41.452
They're booting Mr. Vaughn.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.852
His insurance won't pay for him
to stay here any longer.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.723
He lives all alone. He's not ready
to take care of himself yet.

08:46.759 --> 08:49.319
You know what? I've got pull
with Dr. Cox. Let me handle this.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.091
Mr. Vaughn is such a sweetie.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.588
Don't you wish you could just bring him
home and take care of him yourself?

08:58.905 --> 09:00.304
You're late.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.466
Not five seconds in the door,

09:02.508 --> 09:05.534
and it's already number three
on Mr. Vaughn's greatest hits!

09:05.578 --> 09:07.273
You know, why stop there, Frank?

09:07.313 --> 09:11.147
Coming in at number two, "You never
introduce me to people at parties."

09:11.183 --> 09:15.813
And at the top of the charts, as always,
"What about my feelings?"

09:16.188 --> 09:18.349
I only say those things
because I love you.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.518
Well, you've got a
funny way of showing it.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.220
You know what?
That might be a little weird.

09:26.766 --> 09:29.599
And how many catheters
do we normally order?

09:29.969 --> 09:32.494
Well, just order that! Great.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.002
And there we go.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.802
- What do you think?
- Why?

09:37.843 --> 09:40.778
Because, now you can see
the back of it. See?

09:40.813 --> 09:43.475
Life is more interesting
when you look at the back of things.

09:43.516 --> 09:47.418
Women, that's obvious,
baseball cards, puppet shows.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.513
Plus, you get the 3D effect.
Look at this.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.787
Hey, what's that off in the distance?
A hospital of some sort?

09:53.826 --> 09:56.624
It is a hospital.
Never mind, it took off again.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.129
Here it comes again. What's it want?

09:58.164 --> 10:01.964
It's got Terry! Everyone run!
You know. It's a game.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.298
Try again there, Chewie.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.768
And done. We are the hell out of here.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.570
Hey there, new Chief!

10:09.609 --> 10:11.577
Barbie, did you not see the list outside?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.239
I saw it. I'm a "Sometimes allowed."

10:14.280 --> 10:15.975
Well, now isn't one of those times.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.812
- Yeah, but...
- Don't care, get out.

10:17.850 --> 10:18.942
Man!

10:20.052 --> 10:21.485
I am not answering that.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.284
Carla, finally, a friendly face.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.551
The phone won't stop ringing.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.559
Everybody and their sister
wants a favor.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.288
Actually, speaking of favors,

10:29.328 --> 10:32.627
I've been noticing
all the recent forced overtime.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.361
Maybe we could
hire a few extra nurses?

10:35.668 --> 10:37.260
Of course that's what you wanted.

10:40.239 --> 10:43.970
Just testing out the hammer.
See if it works. It does.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.241
The Board wants to know why
you haven't submitted a new budget.

10:47.279 --> 10:50.146
Hey! You're not the only one
who can hammer.

10:53.786 --> 10:56.846
I'll just come back another time.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.052
Carla.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.157
Stop it.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.666
I can't help you with the nurses.
And I'm really sorry.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.559
It's okay.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.631
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.178
Wow!

11:20.212 --> 11:21.770
Nice digs, Per.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.840
Didn't you see your name on the
"Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever" list?

11:24.884 --> 11:26.181
No, it's not on there.

11:26.218 --> 11:28.152
- Ted!
- I'm on it.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.680
Look, my pneumonia patient
is being discharged,

11:30.723 --> 11:32.350
and he's not ready.
If he goes home now,

11:32.391 --> 11:34.723
he could develop ARDS,
he could relapse,

11:34.760 --> 11:37.354
even fall and break his hip.
I need you to keep him here longer.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.454
Can't do it.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.328
The Board knows
I pull strings for patients

11:40.366 --> 11:41.765
and they're all over my ass.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.031
I got to stay below the radar
for a little while.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.334
Okay. You know what? We're cool.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.533
No. We are not cool.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.599
<i>J.D.: What? Why aren't we cool?</i>

11:50.643 --> 11:53.669
<i>It must be because</i>
<i>we're super cool. Ask him.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.443
- Is it because...
- And no, we're not super cool.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.713
Look, you seem to think that
just because I have this new job,

11:59.752 --> 12:02.949
that suddenly I don't realize
that the patients come first.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.822
That I've somehow forgotten
what matters.

12:05.858 --> 12:09.055
For the love of God,
I taught you what matters,

12:09.095 --> 12:12.758
you arrogant, pretentious,
self-righteous, little jackass.

12:13.332 --> 12:17.462
Are you hammering
in the perfect spots for emphasis?

12:17.803 --> 12:18.895
I was trying to, yeah.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.997
Well, it was just terrific.
Thank you for that.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.705
And you, get the hell out of my office.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.802
Yes, sir.

12:25.845 --> 12:29.008
<i>J.D.: As I left, I couldn't tell if that</i>
<i>pounding was the Janitor's hammering</i>

12:29.048 --> 12:33.041
<i>or just the sound in my head</i>
<i>of Dr. Cox finally being boxed in.</i>

12:46.365 --> 12:47.832
<i>Sometimes, all you can hope for</i>

12:47.867 --> 12:50.427
<i>is a chance to breathe</i>
<i>every now and then.</i>

13:01.580 --> 13:03.377
This is the Chief of Medicine.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.346
Well, that's fine. We will get together

13:08.387 --> 13:11.379
and discuss the NICU issue
on Thursday then.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.754
All righty.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.555
Are you finally finished
with the project?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.825
Yep. All done.

13:18.864 --> 13:19.888
Uh-oh.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.526
Oh, boy!

13:21.934 --> 13:24.562
I got the nail in there, but it's loose.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.968
You know what?
I'm gonna go get some putty.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.906
If you just hold this right here,
I'll be done in a second.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.875
For the love of God.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.343
Just hold it level and tight.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.606
- Bear the weight.
- Here.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.807
Hold it right there.
I'll be back in one minute.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.509
You're doing great.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.879
So, that's what
a Chief of Medicine does.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.015
Now what's with the lab coat, Bob?

13:45.057 --> 13:48.151
The old gal down in pharmacy
doesn't know that I've retired,

13:48.194 --> 13:51.254
so she still hooks me up
with free morning-after pills.

13:51.297 --> 13:55.700
Sir, I was just looking over the...
Oh, dear God in heaven!

13:58.070 --> 13:59.469
Still got it.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.097
How's the pulse, Ted?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.300
Nothing.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.674
Why don't you go somewhere
and lie down?

14:05.711 --> 14:09.203
Nah. I don't need to go dressing on...

14:11.550 --> 14:14.314
So, the Janitor still doing
the picture thing, huh?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.479
I beg your pardon?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.684
Well, every time he would ask me
for a real office, I'd say "no."

14:18.724 --> 14:22.216
So, now if anyone gets
a nice new office,

14:22.261 --> 14:26.925
he gets very angry and he uses
that picture to drive them insane.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.839
Now what the hell does
a janitor need an office for anyway?

14:36.108 --> 14:38.804
So you wanna discuss the urinal
cake issue on Thursday, huh?

14:38.844 --> 14:40.334
Let me check my calendar.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.903
All right, Steve. I'll...

14:43.015 --> 14:44.039
Huh?

14:44.283 --> 14:45.750
What did they do?

14:45.784 --> 14:48.844
Hey. Good one. A little racist.

14:49.688 --> 14:50.746
Yeah, you...

14:50.789 --> 14:53.519
You know what?
Just give my love to Darlene, okay?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.322
Real... Syphilis, huh?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.161
Well, that's...

14:57.529 --> 14:59.895
I'm not a doctor, Steve. But...

15:01.066 --> 15:03.000
That seems unusual, even for syphilis.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.066
I can't believe
they're just kicking him out.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.164
Yeah.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.142
What happened to all that
pull you have with Dr. Cox?

15:11.176 --> 15:12.871
Look, he said
his hands are tied on this one.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.442
- Poppycock.
- What?

15:15.481 --> 15:17.108
That's old man for "bullcrap."

15:17.149 --> 15:18.411
You're an odd duck, aren't you?

15:18.450 --> 15:20.884
That's what they tell me,
but I don't see it.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.221
So I asked Dr. Cox about hiring
some extra nurses and he said "no."

15:26.258 --> 15:30.695
Did you really ask him or did you
just compliment him on his new office?

15:30.729 --> 15:34.096
- You know what? Frick them.
- Frick them? I'm one of them.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.067
Yeah, but they're acting like
a bunch of frickheads.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.069
Sorry about all the F bombs.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.561
I don't blame them
for being frustrated at working here,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.474
because a lot of the times,
I feel the same way.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.535
God, you are so clueless.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.910
You're not mad at me, you're just
frustrated about something else

15:48.948 --> 15:50.381
and you're taking it out on me.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.213
I mean, it's like last night,
when my favorite shoes

15:52.251 --> 15:55.709
made my toes bleed, and so I called
you a frizzy-haired mega-bitch.

15:55.754 --> 15:56.880
That's why we had to make the rule

15:56.922 --> 15:58.014
that we can't just dump on each other

15:58.057 --> 15:59.649
just 'cause we're pissy
about other stuff.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.250
We need to cancel that rule.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.555
Yeah, I agree. It was stupid. I hated it.

16:02.594 --> 16:06.223
Yeah, but, Elliot, all nurses want is
to be treated with the same respect

16:06.265 --> 16:09.530
that you doctors get treated
with every single day.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.092
- I do that.
- You do with me.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.367
But what about all the other nurses?
Like Barbara this morning.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.806
Were you as respectful
as you could have been?

16:17.710 --> 16:20.008
And, ma'am, you should feel
confident in the decision

16:20.045 --> 16:22.104
to give you Clindamycin,
because it was made by someone

16:22.147 --> 16:23.239
who went to medical school

16:23.282 --> 16:24.579
and not someone who turned to nursing

16:24.616 --> 16:26.743
after a failed career
as a recording artist.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.650
And don't you dare try to kick-box me.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.581
Maybe not totally respectful.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.196
When he gets a startle
like the one I gave him earlier,

16:40.232 --> 16:42.826
he usually sleeps about 18 hours.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.533
Have people been taking care
of him since I left?

16:46.572 --> 16:47.937
We've all been pitching in,

16:47.973 --> 16:50.533
spending time with him,
taking him on walks.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.101
Who's a good boy?

16:54.513 --> 16:58.040
So, why are you so afraid to
get all up in Dr. Cox's grill?

16:58.083 --> 17:01.450
We both know he can occasionally
be somewhat of a vengeful person.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.948
- This is demeaning.
- I know,

17:04.990 --> 17:07.788
but that's where I want the picture
for the rest of the day.

17:10.061 --> 17:14.328
Listen, if he wanted to find a place
to hide your patient, he could.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.425
He's just stressed
and out of his elements,

17:16.468 --> 17:18.026
and, hell, he's scared.

17:18.069 --> 17:21.733
And even if he hasn't realized it,
this job is changing him already,

17:21.773 --> 17:25.266
because it comes with a whole host
of overwhelming responsibilities,

17:25.310 --> 17:27.972
including keeping this hospital afloat.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.743
I'd help him if he'd let me,
but you know he won't.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.183
When I was Chief,
if Dr. Cox came to me

17:33.218 --> 17:36.085
and complained about something
I would automatically say "no."

17:36.121 --> 17:38.817
And if he never complained again,
I'd know it wasn't that important.

17:38.857 --> 17:42.224
But if he came back
and fought for it over and over,

17:42.261 --> 17:44.889
I knew it was something
that I'd have to take a look at.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.160
Now he's me,

17:47.199 --> 17:49.895
and he's got this damn voice
in his head

17:49.935 --> 17:52.426
telling him to say "no" all the time.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.237
And he desperately needs
someone on the other side

17:56.275 --> 17:59.335
to tell him what he should do,
whether he wants to hear it or not.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.903
And now, that person is you.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.047
Here we are.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.610
- Will he at least be grateful?
- No.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.623
He's gonna hate you for it.

18:12.391 --> 18:13.517
Go!

18:18.363 --> 18:19.489
What?

18:19.898 --> 18:22.230
Hey, guys. How's it going over here?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.568
Awesome.

18:27.072 --> 18:31.736
Look, Barb, I really just wanted
to come by and apologize

18:31.777 --> 18:33.608
for the way I treated you earlier.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.442
I was planning on waiting for you
in the parking lot tonight

18:35.481 --> 18:37.005
and kicking your teeth in.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.846
- Please don't.
- Even if she tried,

18:38.884 --> 18:42.149
Carla would just swoop in
and protect her doctor friend.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.950
Look, you guys aren't
even really mad at Carla.

18:43.989 --> 18:47.254
You're just frustrated by the situation
and you're taking it out on her.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.260
Carla and I actually had
a rule about that earlier,

18:49.294 --> 18:50.886
but we canceled it because...

18:50.929 --> 18:53.261
You know what?
Probably not that pertinent.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.096
The point is, Carla's a nurse first.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.103
Even if it means
yelling at her best friend.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.331
That's me.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.538
She said that out loud earlier.
You can ask anyone.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.668
Anyway. You can either use her
relationships with us as doctors

19:05.711 --> 19:08.305
to start a dialog
and make things better,

19:08.347 --> 19:11.373
or ignore me, stay pissed
and you can all hold me down

19:11.416 --> 19:14.476
in the parking lot tonight
while Barb here boot-stomps my face.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.750
Taking a pretty long time
to think about it.

19:24.396 --> 19:25.761
Oh.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.264
You got me there.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.790
I thought that was
when it was all gonna go down.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.835
Look, I don't care if we have to fake
a secondary infection,

19:32.871 --> 19:34.998
or claim he's allergic to his medication,

19:35.040 --> 19:38.407
Mr. Vaughn needs to be back here
in a bed, and you know it.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.377
<i>J.D.: I got about the answer I expected.</i>

19:40.412 --> 19:42.107
- Get out!
- No.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.716
Actually, you know what,
stay if you want to.

19:45.751 --> 19:49.050
I'm going to get out of this cage

19:49.588 --> 19:52.056
and I'm gonna go out
and see some patients.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.991
No, you're not.
It's 7:00. Your day's over.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.485
<i>J.D.: It's scary how easy it is to</i>
<i>become resigned to your lot in life.</i>

19:59.231 --> 20:01.825
<i>You just go about your business,</i>
<i>same as always.</i>

20:01.867 --> 20:04.062
So, I hear you're
the new personnel director.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.764
Nice office. I just have to hang this.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.907
<i>J.D.: That's why even the tiniest</i>
<i>change in a dynamic</i>

20:09.942 --> 20:11.307
<i>can seem monumental.</i>

20:11.343 --> 20:14.312
- Good night, Carla. Good night, Elliot.
- Good night.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.246
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:17.282 --> 20:20.740
- Did you do something good?
- I totally did.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.051
Okay, take good care of him.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.588
<i>J.D.: As for me,</i>
<i>I was fine with my new lot in life,</i>

20:30.629 --> 20:34.156
<i>because I knew the payoff</i>
<i>would always outweigh the cost.</i>

20:34.199 --> 20:35.427
Dr. Cox.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.597
Look, I want to thank you
for listening to me about Mr. Vaughn.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.632
Yeah. Go to hell.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.077
<i>J.D.: Or not.</i>

20:57.422 --> 21:03.361
<i>Swing low, sweet chariot</i>

21:03.395 --> 21:05.454
<i>Chariot</i>

21:06.231 --> 21:11.294
<i>Coming for to carry me home</i>

21:11.336 --> 21:13.327
Oh, hey, Dr. Wells. How's it going?

21:13.472 --> 21:16.805
<i>Swing low</i>

21:17.109 --> 21:21.239
<i>sweet chariot</i>

21:21.613 --> 21:28.177
<i>Coming for to carry me home</i>
