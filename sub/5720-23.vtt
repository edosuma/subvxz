WEBVTT

00:02.313 --> 00:03.692
How great is this?

00:03.693 --> 00:06.352
Fresh air and the endorphins.

00:06.353 --> 00:10.102
Ooh, and the cute
little babies and dogs.

00:10.103 --> 00:12.062
This puts everything in perspective.

00:12.063 --> 00:13.312
I ought to do this every day.

00:13.313 --> 00:14.732
I swear, I don't know why I don't.

00:14.733 --> 00:16.352
(breathing hard): I need to stop.

00:16.353 --> 00:18.333
We <i>just</i> started.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.102
Gordon hates running.

00:22.103 --> 00:24.402
Then why did Gordon
say "yes" to running?

00:24.403 --> 00:25.802
Because he's insanely competitive?

00:25.803 --> 00:26.802
What are you looking at?

00:26.803 --> 00:27.772
(children laugh)

00:27.773 --> 00:31.732
And yet, here you are,
wallowing in defeat.

00:31.733 --> 00:33.482
This is a hard thing for me to watch.

00:33.483 --> 00:35.232
You'll get over it.

00:35.233 --> 00:36.562
And I sense you need to
talk to me about something

00:36.563 --> 00:38.102
that requires a working brain,

00:38.103 --> 00:39.812
so I'd rather not risk a stroke.

00:39.813 --> 00:42.352
Well, at least walk
with me, you big baby.

00:42.353 --> 00:45.602
Strangely turned on by you abusing me.

00:45.603 --> 00:46.503
This is sensitive.

00:50.143 --> 00:53.102
Something I haven't read my staff in on.

00:53.103 --> 00:55.102
MIKE: Okay.

00:55.103 --> 00:57.232
I'm starting to normalize, go.

00:57.233 --> 01:00.272
Last time I saw Foreign
Minister Avdonin,

01:00.273 --> 01:01.642
he proposed a trade with me.

01:01.643 --> 01:02.623
Do I need context?

01:02.624 --> 01:03.692
No.

01:03.693 --> 01:07.142
Peter Buckley for an American asset

01:07.143 --> 01:10.602
with a great deal of personal
significance to Henry and me.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.562
Previously, they told us he was dead.

01:12.563 --> 01:14.746
Now they're saying he's not,
and we could get him back.

01:14.747 --> 01:19.942
Now, I know the politics of
a trade can be complicated,

01:19.943 --> 01:22.522
so I'm asking if you
could imagine a scenario

01:22.523 --> 01:25.482
where Dalton might agree to that deal.

01:25.483 --> 01:26.692
No. Breakfast?

01:26.693 --> 01:29.312
Come on.

01:29.313 --> 01:31.296
You're really gonna make
me step this out for you?

01:31.297 --> 01:33.812
First, to clarify, Peter Buckley,

01:33.813 --> 01:35.762
the most notorious
American spy in history.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.482
- Responsible for the deaths
- I know that.

01:37.483 --> 01:38.732
of six CIA agents,

01:38.733 --> 01:39.942
Two of whom, Dalton,

01:39.943 --> 01:42.272
former Director of the
CIA, knew personally.

01:42.273 --> 01:43.852
That Peter Buckley? I'm sorry,

01:43.853 --> 01:44.942
I actually do need context

01:44.943 --> 01:46.852
as to why you would ask
me anything so stupid.

01:46.853 --> 01:49.352
Because it is incredibly important,

01:49.353 --> 01:50.812
and there's a clock on it.

01:50.813 --> 01:52.482
You really made me step <i>that</i> out?

01:52.483 --> 01:54.642
Okay. Even if Dalton would consider it,

01:54.643 --> 01:57.042
Russell Jackson would throw
his body in front of that train.

01:57.043 --> 01:58.026
Making a trade like that

01:58.027 --> 01:59.610
with the Russians, in an election year?

01:59.611 --> 02:01.812
Even if you had monkey
pictures on both of them,

02:01.813 --> 02:03.522
- and got them to agree,
- What are monkey pictures?

02:03.523 --> 02:05.786
I highly doubt your prisoner
exchange is even legitimate.

02:05.787 --> 02:08.312
If you think your asset is
dead, he's probably dead.

02:08.312 --> 02:09.482
But by even

02:09.483 --> 02:11.482
considering a trade for Buckley,

02:11.483 --> 02:13.562
you've revealed your
attachment to your asset.

02:13.563 --> 02:15.482
Now, Avdonin's using
that to his advantage,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.312
claiming this dead person is alive

02:17.313 --> 02:18.776
without having to provide any proof.

02:18.777 --> 02:20.562
So brilliant negotiating strategy there.

02:20.563 --> 02:22.442
I he... I hear you,

02:22.443 --> 02:25.413
when you say you think
this is a terrible idea.

02:27.353 --> 02:29.312
But I haven't had a moment's peace

02:29.313 --> 02:31.352
since I realized this was possible.

02:31.353 --> 02:33.602
I have to try.

02:33.603 --> 02:36.522
Can't... can't you just do your thing...

02:36.523 --> 02:39.522
to find out exactly how
suicidal this mission is?

02:39.523 --> 02:40.666
I guess I could talk to some

02:40.667 --> 02:42.022
of my data-wonk pollster friends,

02:42.023 --> 02:43.522
and see what the favorability stats

02:43.523 --> 02:44.982
would be on a Buckley trade.

02:44.983 --> 02:46.902
And it has been almost 20 years

02:46.903 --> 02:48.522
and people are idiots.

02:48.523 --> 02:50.106
Long-term memory is at an all-time low,

02:50.107 --> 02:51.522
so we've got that going for us.

02:51.523 --> 02:52.852
Well, see?

02:52.853 --> 02:54.953
Things are looking up already.

02:55.733 --> 02:57.232
(sighs deeply)

02:57.233 --> 02:57.963
HENRY: Hey, babe.

02:57.964 --> 02:58.732
Hey.

02:58.733 --> 02:59.942
Hey, Mom. How was your run?

02:59.943 --> 03:02.402
It was great. I feel so clean

03:02.403 --> 03:04.522
and healthy and... (gasps). Waffles!?

03:04.523 --> 03:05.826
Yeah, Dad fixed the waffle iron.

03:05.827 --> 03:06.692
Yes!

03:06.693 --> 03:07.836
It just needed a new switch.

03:07.837 --> 03:09.642
And he built a firepit in the backyard.

03:09.643 --> 03:11.982
- I dug a hole and put some bricks
around it. - ELIZABETH (laughs): What?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.531
Course, the Secret Service
won't let us use it.

03:13.532 --> 03:14.127
ELIZABETH: Aw...

03:14.128 --> 03:16.272
ALISON: And now he's talking mini-golf.

03:16.273 --> 03:19.732
Ho! So this is Henry
McCord on sabbatical, huh?

03:19.733 --> 03:20.942
I'm enjoying the time.

03:20.943 --> 03:22.562
It doesn't happen that often.

03:22.563 --> 03:24.602
And come on, we love mini-golf.

03:24.603 --> 03:26.186
It was a Friday night thing for like...

03:26.187 --> 03:26.852
A summer.

03:26.853 --> 03:28.402
Two summers, at least.

03:28.403 --> 03:29.301
You sure have been jazzed

03:29.302 --> 03:30.902
about all these
life-affirming activities

03:30.903 --> 03:32.401
since your weekend with a think tank

03:32.402 --> 03:34.104
- in San Diego.
- I've got the time off.

03:34.105 --> 03:35.649
I think I should take advantage of it.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.402
So, come on,

03:36.403 --> 03:38.163
who's in? Mini-golf tonight.

03:39.103 --> 03:40.142
Um, I can't.

03:40.143 --> 03:41.968
I have to see Jareth tonight.

03:41.969 --> 03:44.267
'Cause he just accepted a...

03:44.268 --> 03:45.517
two-year fellowship in Oxford,

03:45.518 --> 03:47.622
so we have to talk about
how we're going to do the...

03:47.623 --> 03:48.141
(sighs)

03:48.142 --> 03:48.966
long-distance thing.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.017
ELIZABETH: Gosh,

03:50.018 --> 03:52.057
honey, that... that's
rough, but you know what?

03:52.058 --> 03:52.961
Your dad and I did it.

03:52.962 --> 03:53.848
A lot of people do it.

03:53.849 --> 03:54.807
ELIZABETH: Yeah.

03:54.808 --> 03:55.897
You'll-you'll figure it out.

03:55.898 --> 03:57.380
- Hey, uh, you know what would really
clear your minds, - STEVIE: Dad.

03:57.381 --> 03:59.644
- Give you some perspective...
Mini-golf. - Don't... Dad.

03:59.645 --> 04:01.017
I'm serious. Just ask Jareth.

04:01.018 --> 04:02.727
He's British. He's got to like golf.

04:02.728 --> 04:03.387
Mini-golf.

04:03.388 --> 04:04.887
Hey, help me out.

04:04.888 --> 04:05.723
Alison, Jason.

04:05.724 --> 04:07.428
- All right. Fine. I'm in.
- Yeah, me, too.

04:07.429 --> 04:08.347
I'll ask him.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.727
Joe and Mimma's after

04:09.728 --> 04:11.407
- for gooey calzones, yeah?
- They bought.

04:11.408 --> 04:12.307
Stop selling.

04:12.308 --> 04:14.307
Well, they'll get into
it once we're there.

04:14.308 --> 04:15.948
I'm sure.

04:16.468 --> 04:20.846
So aside from fixing the waffle iron,

04:20.848 --> 04:22.597
and building a firepit,

04:22.598 --> 04:24.427
and obsessing about mini-golf,

04:24.428 --> 04:26.637
everything okay post Islamabad?

04:26.638 --> 04:28.427
It's fine.

04:28.428 --> 04:30.807
'Cause, you know, we
could always go back

04:30.808 --> 04:32.637
and see Dr. Sherman.

04:32.638 --> 04:34.597
Honestly, I just want to immerse myself

04:34.598 --> 04:36.677
in mindless activities for a while.

04:36.678 --> 04:37.948
Okay.

04:39.468 --> 04:41.427
Not counting on me
for mini-golf, are you?

04:41.428 --> 04:44.395
Uh, after the last time, I don't think
you're allowed back there,

04:44.396 --> 04:46.011
- 'cause you threw...
- I did not throw that club.

04:46.012 --> 04:46.698
All... all right.

04:46.699 --> 04:47.517
I...I...

04:47.518 --> 04:49.189
- ...was gesturing.
- Yeah, tell that

04:49.190 --> 04:51.533
- and it slipped. My hands were wet.
- to the lady who's...

04:51.534 --> 04:53.764
- We'll miss you.
- I think it was raining.

04:53.899 --> 04:55.028
JAY: <i>Our intel is that</i>

04:55.029 --> 04:57.608
all remnants of Hizb Al-Shahid
have gone underground.

04:57.609 --> 04:59.568
Even the remaining stolen uranium

04:59.569 --> 05:01.568
has been found and
seized by American forces.

05:01.569 --> 05:02.632
Yeah, their press releases

05:02.633 --> 05:05.818
are all full of optimism,
and national pride.

05:05.819 --> 05:08.188
Global response has been positive,

05:08.189 --> 05:09.818
with just a handful
of the usual suspects

05:09.819 --> 05:11.122
grumbling about U.S. aggression.

05:11.123 --> 05:14.528
From a polling data and optics
perspective, we're on course.

05:14.529 --> 05:16.858
Okay. Good. Um,

05:16.859 --> 05:18.608
No Matt, today?

05:18.609 --> 05:20.032
Commencement season. He's holed up.

05:20.033 --> 05:23.528
Apparently, he's agreed to
write six speeches this year.

05:23.529 --> 05:25.278
Yeah, including mine.

05:25.279 --> 05:27.608
Oh, who are the lucky graduates?

05:27.609 --> 05:28.709
UMASS Pittsfield.

05:30.529 --> 05:32.648
(clears throat) They have quite a
respected foreign policy program.

05:32.649 --> 05:33.512
And they asked first.

05:33.513 --> 05:35.408
The Secretary's a big
fan of "asked first."

05:35.409 --> 05:37.818
- (chair squeaking)
- Was that Dr. McCord's strategy, ma'am?

05:37.819 --> 05:40.238
(laughs) Possibly.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.579
I have an appointment.

05:42.529 --> 05:44.478
It's personal. Spontaneous.

05:44.479 --> 05:45.528
Whimsical, even.

05:45.529 --> 05:47.629
It's fine. I'm reachable.

05:50.819 --> 05:52.339
I know what that is.

05:53.279 --> 05:53.924
Madam Secretary.

05:53.925 --> 05:54.648
Yeah.

05:54.649 --> 05:55.608
Oh, you're leaving?

05:55.609 --> 05:56.818
I'll be back.

05:56.819 --> 05:58.028
I was working on your
commencement speech,

05:58.029 --> 05:59.738
and I was hoping you could give me

05:59.739 --> 06:00.898
some personal anecdote

06:00.899 --> 06:03.318
that-that proffers
some nugget of wisdom

06:03.319 --> 06:04.528
that we could give the kids.

06:04.529 --> 06:07.648
Uh, saving the Pacific Rim
Trade Agreement, for example.

06:07.649 --> 06:09.358
Détente with Russia.

06:09.359 --> 06:10.622
Dropping the embargo with Cuba.

06:10.623 --> 06:12.278
I mean, there's a lot of good options.

06:12.279 --> 06:13.782
Yeah, I-I-I don't know if any of that

06:13.783 --> 06:15.978
really jibes with my overall message.

06:15.979 --> 06:17.648
You have an overall message?

06:17.649 --> 06:20.478
I don't know. Do I?

06:20.479 --> 06:22.568
I'm just data-gathering,
but I'm open to your ideas.

06:22.569 --> 06:24.858
I... let me... let me mull it over.

06:24.859 --> 06:27.068
See if I can come up with a message,

06:27.069 --> 06:28.818
or even a theme.

06:28.819 --> 06:30.898
Ooh, a theme would be awesome.

06:30.899 --> 06:33.278
Oh, what about the chrysalis thing?

06:33.279 --> 06:35.648
A caterpillar into the butterfly...?

06:35.649 --> 06:38.028
Are you messing with me?

06:38.029 --> 06:40.738
(bell tolling slowly)

06:40.739 --> 06:42.778
ELIZABETH: Anton, thank you for agreeing

06:42.779 --> 06:45.478
to meet on short notice.

06:45.479 --> 06:47.648
ANTON: The last time we
did this, it worked out.

06:47.649 --> 06:49.608
ELIZABETH: It did. Those boys

06:49.609 --> 06:52.398
made it safely home
from Syria. Thank you.

06:52.399 --> 06:56.398
You're still a cultural attaché, huh?

06:56.399 --> 06:57.528
Yes.

06:57.529 --> 06:59.108
The work itself is quite dull,

06:59.109 --> 07:02.568
but the quality of life
makes it all worthwhile.

07:02.569 --> 07:06.778
Katarina got into Harvard, early action.

07:06.779 --> 07:08.539
Congratulations.

07:09.819 --> 07:11.478
I need information

07:11.479 --> 07:14.898
on a Russian army
captain, Dmitri Petrov.

07:14.899 --> 07:17.648
Officially, he died from a fever

07:17.649 --> 07:19.608
he contracted while stationed in Ukraine

07:19.609 --> 07:20.524
during the conflict.

07:20.525 --> 07:21.478
Yes.

07:21.479 --> 07:23.818
Officially, that is how
every Russian soldier

07:23.819 --> 07:26.688
who died at the front met his fate.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.858
Our young men are impervious to bullets,

07:28.859 --> 07:31.608
but, sadly, suffer from weak lungs.

07:31.609 --> 07:33.738
I have reason to
believe he's still alive,

07:33.739 --> 07:35.858
but I need hard evidence.
Incontrovertible.

07:35.859 --> 07:37.528
And why do you care so much

07:37.529 --> 07:39.499
about this particular
Russian army captain?

07:41.689 --> 07:43.648
I know you do realize that I'm friends

07:43.649 --> 07:45.192
with the dean of admission at Harvard.

07:45.193 --> 07:49.778
I'm sure Katarina got
in on her own merits,

07:49.779 --> 07:51.818
but you did list me as a reference,

07:51.819 --> 07:56.398
and I had some free
time, and I made a call.

07:56.399 --> 08:00.039
I will do my best, Madam Secretary.

08:01.979 --> 08:03.499
Thank you.

08:10.899 --> 08:12.642
(music playing, golf
ball plinking into cup)

08:12.643 --> 08:14.421
HENRY: Have anything like
this in the UK, Jareth?

08:14.422 --> 08:15.631
JARETH (chuckles): No, sir.

08:15.632 --> 08:17.272
Golf's quite a serious
pursuit over there.

08:17.273 --> 08:19.102
STEVIE: It's fine to think it's goofy.

08:19.103 --> 08:20.442
Part of its charm.

08:25.962 --> 08:27.791
Your turn, dingus. Go.

08:27.792 --> 08:29.591
Um, I'll pass on this one.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.815
I know those guys from school.

08:30.816 --> 08:32.001
But what about your score?

08:32.001 --> 08:32.818
What was...?

08:32.820 --> 08:35.211
It's already the size
of the national debt.

08:35.212 --> 08:36.551
Let her go.

08:36.552 --> 08:39.841
Hello, hole-in-one.

08:39.842 --> 08:40.852
HENRY: Oh, sorry.

08:47.882 --> 08:49.631
You know what? This is ridiculous.

08:49.632 --> 08:50.841
The clowns and the windmills

08:50.842 --> 08:51.825
and the jumping dolphins

08:51.826 --> 08:53.291
are supposed to convey an atmosphere

08:53.292 --> 08:54.771
of family fun, while the game itself

08:54.772 --> 08:56.155
is just designed to infuriate you.

08:56.156 --> 08:58.381
Okay, look, just take a
deep breath. It's okay.

08:58.382 --> 08:59.527
It's all right.

08:59.528 --> 09:00.772
I'm getting a snow cone.

09:02.052 --> 09:03.671
I counsel we skip this one.

09:03.672 --> 09:05.482
Just give ourselves twos and move on.

09:08.552 --> 09:10.501
Sorry, this isn't exactly the
kind of outing I'd planned.

09:10.502 --> 09:11.501
No, it's fine. I'm having a lovely time.

09:11.502 --> 09:13.251
Um, wh-while... while
I've got you a moment,

09:13.252 --> 09:15.155
- there's something I wanted to ask you.
- Sure.

09:15.156 --> 09:16.711
Um, I know Stevie's already told you

09:16.712 --> 09:18.671
that I accepted a fellowship at Oxford.

09:18.672 --> 09:21.051
Yes. Oh, wow, I-I know
you're going to work

09:21.052 --> 09:22.711
- the relationship part out.
- Yeah.

09:22.712 --> 09:24.655
Elizabeth and I did it
when I was in the Marines,

09:24.656 --> 09:26.679
and that was before Skype
and JetBlue and all that.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.631
Yeah. Oh, oh, see, uh,
uh, about that, um...

09:29.632 --> 09:31.522
see, the thing is, Dr. McCord, um...

09:33.552 --> 09:36.751
The thing is, I'm hopelessly
in love with your daughter.

09:36.752 --> 09:39.631
And I don't... I don't want to imagine

09:39.632 --> 09:42.751
my life without her. I...

09:42.752 --> 09:46.751
I don't want to go off to
Oxford without this settled,

09:46.752 --> 09:52.091
um, and so, I suppose,
I'm rather awkwardly, uh,

09:52.092 --> 09:55.812
asking your blessing to propose to her.

09:59.422 --> 10:00.591
Propose...

10:00.592 --> 10:02.072
Marriage?

10:02.073 --> 10:03.631
That's what I said.

10:03.632 --> 10:05.791
I mean, don't these kids
have other steps, first?

10:05.792 --> 10:06.627
The way we did.

10:06.628 --> 10:07.461
I know.

10:07.462 --> 10:09.631
Like... living together.

10:09.632 --> 10:10.461
Breaking up,

10:10.462 --> 10:11.547
and living together.

10:11.548 --> 10:12.631
We didn't break up.

10:12.632 --> 10:14.751
I-I just needed a
little time to freak out.

10:14.752 --> 10:15.961
It was the worst

10:15.962 --> 10:17.501
- five days of my life.
- Three.

10:17.502 --> 10:20.341
Followed by the greatest proposal ever.

10:20.342 --> 10:23.751
Yes, the discount skywriter.

10:23.752 --> 10:25.711
"Mar Me Elibet."

10:25.712 --> 10:26.921
Hey, it worked.

10:26.922 --> 10:28.791
It did. But wait...

10:28.792 --> 10:30.812
So what did you say?

10:31.712 --> 10:32.982
I said yes.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.062
Without talking to me?

10:37.592 --> 10:38.591
Wow!

10:38.592 --> 10:43.381
Did you guys just
full-on Edith Wharton this

10:43.382 --> 10:45.961
and act like my voice
wasn't going to matter?

10:45.962 --> 10:48.812
Did you negotiate a dowry?

10:49.842 --> 10:51.671
I-I... honestly,
babe, I was so stunned,

10:51.672 --> 10:53.841
I might have actually
turned into an idiot.

10:53.842 --> 10:55.711
- Huh.
- It was really more E.M. Forster

10:55.712 --> 10:57.501
'cause of the whole English thing.

10:57.502 --> 11:00.001
Look, it was just...

11:00.002 --> 11:02.551
It's just a formality, anyway.

11:02.552 --> 11:04.751
He's going to do what he wants.

11:04.752 --> 11:07.501
Well, what do we say if she says yes?

11:07.502 --> 11:08.461
I don't know.

11:08.462 --> 11:12.671
He's such a great guy,
but they're so young.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.501
That's what we say.

11:15.502 --> 11:18.501
We love Jareth,

11:18.502 --> 11:21.631
but we will love him
even more in two years.

11:21.632 --> 11:24.091
Okay, let's just see what happens.

11:24.092 --> 11:26.051
It's just getting engaged.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.591
Exactly, exactly.

11:27.592 --> 11:29.591
And they can take their
time getting married.

11:29.592 --> 11:33.711
I mean, some-some...
engagements go on forever.

11:33.712 --> 11:36.591
My brother and Sophie?

11:36.592 --> 11:38.711
(scoffs) Oh, yeah,
like, 15 years, right?

11:38.712 --> 11:40.615
- (laughing): Yeah.
- Did they ever get married?

11:40.616 --> 11:42.501
I don't know. I think so.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.501
(sighs) You know what,

11:44.502 --> 11:47.841
this... is kind of a champagne problem.

11:47.842 --> 11:52.501
I mean, this terrific guy with
a fellowship to Oxford in physics

11:52.502 --> 11:54.961
wants to marry our daughter.

11:54.962 --> 11:56.501
I think we'll survive.

11:56.502 --> 11:57.192
(laughing): Yeah.

11:57.193 --> 11:57.982
(chuckles)

12:02.882 --> 12:04.881
Oh, Henry.

12:04.882 --> 12:06.852
Our baby.

12:11.462 --> 12:13.562
I know.

12:15.748 --> 12:17.251
JAY: <i>After your commencement address,</i>

12:17.252 --> 12:19.751
you'll be joining the school's president

12:19.752 --> 12:20.921
for a luncheon in his home.

12:20.922 --> 12:23.131
(gasps) Gordon, come here, good buddy.

12:23.132 --> 12:24.501
Come here, come on, Gordon.

12:24.502 --> 12:25.591
There's a good boy.

12:25.592 --> 12:27.591
Mike B., you can come in.

12:27.592 --> 12:28.551
Hi.

12:28.552 --> 12:30.751
Are we doing this
here, in front of them?

12:30.752 --> 12:34.211
Always a pleasure to see you too, Mike.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.635
I'm ready to read them in. Here,
you go walk with Uncle Mike.

12:36.636 --> 12:38.946
Oh, come here. All
right. Who raised you?

12:39.712 --> 12:40.751
ELIZABETH: So, uh,

12:40.752 --> 12:44.091
had Mike B. running
some favorability numbers

12:44.092 --> 12:47.841
on the idea of trading Peter
Buckley to the Russians.

12:47.842 --> 12:49.835
Obviously, that does
not leave this room.

12:49.836 --> 12:50.746
Well, it ain't pretty.

12:50.747 --> 12:53.349
48% say they'd view
the trade unfavorably.

12:53.350 --> 12:55.018
Well, that's less than 50.

12:55.019 --> 12:58.058
With 32% saying they'd view
it "extremely unfavorably."

12:58.059 --> 12:59.218
Oh.

12:59.219 --> 13:00.842
And how would they view President Dalton

13:00.843 --> 13:01.978
for making such a trade?

13:01.979 --> 13:05.348
Ah, that came in at 78%:
"What are you, nuts?"

13:05.349 --> 13:07.018
Figured as much.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.218
That's why you're here.

13:08.219 --> 13:10.058
Wha...?

13:10.059 --> 13:11.558
I have no idea what's going on.

13:11.559 --> 13:13.218
It's Washington. Who does?

13:13.219 --> 13:15.388
I want you to put together a package

13:15.389 --> 13:18.178
of inducements of equal or greater value

13:18.179 --> 13:19.522
to the Russians as Peter Buckley.

13:19.523 --> 13:20.348
Can you do that?

13:20.349 --> 13:23.598
I can try, but it'll have
to be pretty damn enticing.

13:23.599 --> 13:25.178
He's kind of a white whale for them.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.978
And who or what would we be

13:27.979 --> 13:29.138
getting in return?

13:29.139 --> 13:32.348
Let's just say another white whale.

13:32.349 --> 13:34.333
Understood, ma'am.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.414
Great, now that we're done
speaking in Melville code,

13:36.415 --> 13:37.262
can we have the room?

13:37.263 --> 13:41.072
You and I have other
problems to discuss.

13:47.013 --> 13:48.012
Really?

13:48.013 --> 13:49.642
Really.

13:49.643 --> 13:51.012
Really.

13:51.013 --> 13:52.642
Fine.

13:52.643 --> 13:54.866
My friend also told me that
his company was commissioned

13:54.867 --> 13:57.227
by an unnamed entity...
read: the White House...

13:57.228 --> 13:59.637
to do a poll on three
people: Albert Kopp,

13:59.638 --> 14:02.597
Lloyd Frost and Calvin Hastings.

14:02.598 --> 14:03.643
So?

14:03.644 --> 14:04.727
They're all heavy-hitters

14:04.728 --> 14:06.597
with foreign policy credentials.

14:06.598 --> 14:08.427
In fact, they were on the short list

14:08.428 --> 14:10.051
- (snoring)
- after Secretary Marsh died.

14:10.052 --> 14:11.712
The White House is looking to dump you.

14:12.928 --> 14:14.927
(laughing): Oh, come on.

14:14.928 --> 14:16.578
What...?

14:19.688 --> 14:22.727
First of all, Conrad is a friend.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.448
Uh-huh.

14:25.518 --> 14:27.347
And secondly,

14:27.348 --> 14:29.427
I-I-I've had a few successes.

14:29.428 --> 14:31.427
Listen, you could be Thomas Jefferson,

14:31.428 --> 14:33.891
but I'm telling you, it looks
like you're about to get canned.

14:33.892 --> 14:35.517
Why?

14:35.518 --> 14:36.477
It's an election year.

14:36.478 --> 14:38.698
There... there could
be a million reasons.

14:42.978 --> 14:44.977
Well, thank you for the
heads up, Mike, but...

14:44.978 --> 14:47.807
I'm not worried.

14:47.808 --> 14:50.477
And now that that's settled,

14:50.478 --> 14:52.807
let's let the secretary
get back to work.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.578
Sure. Why not?

- Let me see.

15:43.514 --> 15:44.803
Yeah, I forgot.

15:44.804 --> 15:47.473
Um, yeah, and he got down
on one knee and-and...

15:47.474 --> 15:49.473

restaurant was watching.

15:51.854 --> 15:53.853
Wow, because you said yes.

15:53.854 --> 15:55.893
Of course you did, with that ring.

15:55.894 --> 15:57.303
Oh, it's a family heirloom.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.119
Yeah.

15:58.120 --> 15:58.973
Oh. Mm!

15:58.974 --> 16:00.643
Well, congratulations.

16:00.644 --> 16:02.183
Uh, that...

16:02.184 --> 16:03.847
We-we couldn't be
happier for you, really.

16:03.848 --> 16:05.473
And we're sure the date is way off.

16:05.474 --> 16:07.563
'Cause you got to finish
college and law school.

16:07.564 --> 16:09.827
Oh, why are we...? We don't
need to think about that now.

16:09.828 --> 16:10.893
Let's not.

16:10.894 --> 16:12.803
Let's... let's have that champagne.

16:12.804 --> 16:14.473
Well, actually, it's not that far.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.303
We were thinking we-we might
have it in DC at the courthouse.

that this is too fast?

16:34.434 --> 16:36.393
(whispering): Way too fast.

16:36.394 --> 16:38.393
MIKE: Okay, I've done my homework,

16:38.394 --> 16:40.263
and here's where we are.

16:40.264 --> 16:42.723
First up, Albert Kopp,
deputy secretary under Marsh,

16:42.724 --> 16:45.579
now works in the private
sector consulting for an NGO.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.248
I knew him well.

16:48.249 --> 16:50.208
(sighs) The plagiarism
scandal from years ago

16:50.209 --> 16:51.288
is probably behind him,

16:51.289 --> 16:54.868
but the "everyone in
bureaucracy hated him" scandal

16:54.869 --> 16:56.368
most likely is not.

16:56.369 --> 16:59.708
I doubt Dalton would hoist
him on the rank and file.

16:59.709 --> 17:01.038
Lloyd Frost.

17:01.039 --> 17:03.078
Former high-ranking military officer,

17:03.079 --> 17:06.657
two-term congressman and
ex-ambassador to Indonesia.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.082
Frost would never relocate to DC...

17:08.083 --> 17:10.208
Because his mistress lives in San Diego.

17:10.209 --> 17:11.208
Yes, I know.

17:11.209 --> 17:13.208
Okay.

17:13.209 --> 17:15.417
Calvin Hastings, former
ambassador to the UN.

17:15.419 --> 17:16.882
Plenty of foreign policy experience.

17:16.883 --> 17:18.117
And he's from a purple state,

17:18.118 --> 17:20.417
so his constituency
would be useful to Dalton.

17:20.419 --> 17:21.748
Uh-huh.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.078
His wife is a veteran.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.417
They have three beautiful children.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.748
And he has a history of
outside-the-box thinking.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.788
If anything, he's a
Secretary McCord 2.0.

17:32.789 --> 17:34.158
And he's clean.

17:34.159 --> 17:36.658
Well...

17:36.659 --> 17:38.328
if you can't find dirt
on him, nobody can.

17:38.329 --> 17:41.208
Thank you.

17:41.209 --> 17:42.328
Frankly, I think he'd make

17:42.329 --> 17:44.828
a more useful secretary than Elizabeth.

17:44.829 --> 17:46.708
Because he's from a swing state.

17:46.709 --> 17:47.929
Relax.

17:52.159 --> 17:54.158
I miss my shoes.

17:54.159 --> 17:56.708
ELIZABETH: <i>Well, that was brutal.</i>

17:56.709 --> 18:01.708
All that champagne and terrible ideas.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.328
My face hurts from fake smiling.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.418
How do you think my tongue
feels from me biting it?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.288
She's going to put school

18:08.289 --> 18:10.158
on hold and maybe

18:10.159 --> 18:13.748
find work in a pub... she did say pub.

18:13.749 --> 18:17.708
For the experience of immersing herself

18:17.709 --> 18:18.958
in the culture?

18:18.959 --> 18:20.742
Oh, yeah, we are gonna
have to say something.

18:20.743 --> 18:23.458
Oh, you are definitely
gonna have to say something.

18:23.459 --> 18:26.248
Really?

18:26.249 --> 18:31.158
You're going to have to make her
understand about concrete plans,

18:31.159 --> 18:35.918
and-and contingency
plans, and future PLA...

18:35.919 --> 18:37.562
you're just gonna have to explain plans.

18:37.563 --> 18:38.587
Look, I know you're upset

18:38.588 --> 18:40.342
you weren't consulted
about the proposal,

18:40.343 --> 18:42.342
- Yeah! - but now I'm the
one that has to tell her

18:42.343 --> 18:43.686
she's about to screw up her life?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.049
Yes, and now is not a good time

18:45.050 --> 18:46.668
for me to confront my contradictions.

18:46.669 --> 18:50.168
I just need you to stop
this from happening.

18:50.169 --> 18:51.498
Okay, okay, I'll do my best.

18:51.499 --> 18:56.298
I-It is like my entire
history of parental guidance

18:56.299 --> 18:58.708
is-is being erased.

18:58.709 --> 19:00.378
There's no bank.

19:00.379 --> 19:02.588
Nothing that I have done

19:02.589 --> 19:05.758
up to this point matters.

19:05.759 --> 19:07.878
Is this all about Stevie?

19:07.879 --> 19:09.269
Yes! Maybe.

19:11.459 --> 19:12.668
I don't know.

19:12.669 --> 19:14.769
What's going on?

19:15.707 --> 19:17.758
Conrad's looking to replace me.

19:17.759 --> 19:20.519
What?! Says who?

19:22.459 --> 19:23.548
Mike B.

19:23.549 --> 19:26.088
Mike B., come on, that guy

19:26.089 --> 19:29.498
dines out on controversy and bad news.

19:29.499 --> 19:33.758
Yes, and as a result, he
has a jump on everything.

19:33.759 --> 19:35.628
That's got to be some
kind of crazy rumor.

19:35.629 --> 19:37.708
Conrad would never do that to you.

19:37.709 --> 19:38.798
You've been so loyal.

19:38.799 --> 19:41.088
I find it inconceivable
that he would turn on you

19:41.089 --> 19:42.258
like this.

19:42.259 --> 19:44.628
Well, it is Washington

19:44.629 --> 19:48.128
and there is an election coming up,

19:48.129 --> 19:50.399
and the crazy thing is...

19:52.799 --> 19:55.208
...until now, I didn't even realize

19:55.209 --> 19:57.559
how much I've come to love the job.

19:59.919 --> 20:02.269
That's the first time I've
ever heard you say that.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.809
I know.

20:16.401 --> 20:17.740
BLAKE: <i>Uh, good morning, ma'am.</i>

20:17.741 --> 20:18.740
<i>Uh, you received a call</i>

20:18.741 --> 20:19.820
from an Anton Durchenko

20:19.821 --> 20:21.490
from the Russian Embassy.

20:21.491 --> 20:22.490
- Yeah.
- Uh...

20:22.491 --> 20:23.870
He's a cultural attaché.

20:23.871 --> 20:25.174
He-he-he says that you know him.

20:25.175 --> 20:26.910
Yeah, from my CIA days.

20:26.911 --> 20:29.160
Oh, well, uh, he called to
invite you to a concert today

20:29.161 --> 20:30.910
at the Russian Embassy.

20:30.911 --> 20:33.240
I told him you were very
busy but he insisted that

20:33.241 --> 20:34.780
you would be interested.

20:34.781 --> 20:37.280
It's, uh, <i>Rachmaninoff's
String Quartet Number 1.</i>

20:37.281 --> 20:38.881
Okay, clear my afternoon.

20:39.951 --> 20:40.740
R-Really?

20:40.741 --> 20:43.490
Yeah, I could use a little break.

20:43.491 --> 20:45.080
Tell Anton I'm coming.

20:45.081 --> 20:47.160
Uh, yes, ma'am.

20:47.161 --> 20:49.620
Bring you back some caviar and vodka.

20:49.621 --> 20:50.780
Oh, please, don't.

20:50.781 --> 20:52.881
I'm cleansing.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.921
<i>(Rachmaninoff's String
Quartet Number 1 plays)</i>

21:21.821 --> 21:23.921
That's all the
documentation I could find.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.301
<i>(String Quartet Number
1 continues playing)</i>

21:53.531 --> 21:56.761
(sighs)

21:58.621 --> 21:59.820
ELIZABETH: <i>Minister Avdonin,</i>

21:59.821 --> 22:01.910
where did you think this road would lead

22:01.911 --> 22:05.030
when you decided to manipulate me

22:05.031 --> 22:06.660
and the United States Government?

22:06.661 --> 22:08.990
It took exactly one move from me

22:08.991 --> 22:11.030
to find the proof that Captain Dmitri

22:11.031 --> 22:12.080
Petrov is dead.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.950
Madam Secretary, forgive me,

22:13.951 --> 22:16.370
but I have to call into
question this so-called proof

22:16.371 --> 22:17.820
that you claim to have.

22:17.821 --> 22:19.660
Oh, it was-it was pretty convincing.

22:19.661 --> 22:21.030
Dmitri Petrov's treachery

22:21.031 --> 22:23.200
had to remain secret to the public

22:23.201 --> 22:26.200
at large, but in order
to maintain the appearance

22:26.201 --> 22:28.700
of strength among the
military's officer class,

22:28.701 --> 22:32.870
President Salnikov falsified
the captain's execution.

22:32.871 --> 22:36.740
I saw a photo of him
with a bullet in his head.

22:36.741 --> 22:38.080
What can I say?

22:38.081 --> 22:39.921
We're very good at what we do.

22:41.081 --> 22:44.080
I want proof of life
before we can proceed.

22:44.081 --> 22:45.410
No.

22:45.411 --> 22:47.740
President Salnikov wants to maintain

22:47.741 --> 22:49.370
the pretense of Dmitri's death.

22:49.371 --> 22:52.780
He will not risk exposing this operation

22:52.781 --> 22:55.910
for anything short of
Peter Buckley's freedom.

22:55.911 --> 22:58.740
It's the reason why he
kept the traitor alive.

22:58.741 --> 23:00.910
Now he sees that the time is right,

23:00.911 --> 23:03.240
given such high-level interest.

23:03.241 --> 23:06.740
I would only consider
moving forward with the trade

23:06.741 --> 23:10.261
if there was a good faith gesture.

23:11.911 --> 23:14.950
Dmitri Petrov's sister Talia released

23:14.951 --> 23:17.080
from prison in advance.

23:17.081 --> 23:19.660
That can be arranged.

23:19.661 --> 23:22.120
I will process the orders right away.

23:22.121 --> 23:25.120
But as for Dmitri,
it's Buckley or nothing.

23:25.121 --> 23:27.120
And I'm running out of patience.

23:27.121 --> 23:30.051
Good-bye, Madam Secretary.

23:31.871 --> 23:32.910
Ma'am, a word?

23:32.911 --> 23:33.910
We have proof.

23:33.911 --> 23:34.854
You're on your way out.

23:34.855 --> 23:36.450
We have some rather unsettling news,

23:36.451 --> 23:37.611
but I wouldn't call it proof.

23:37.612 --> 23:39.146
They're gonna be moving the
furniture out while you're

23:39.147 --> 23:40.910
- protecting her feelings.
- Just tell me.

23:40.911 --> 23:42.780
Calvin Hastings' wife
moved heaven and earth

23:42.781 --> 23:44.284
to get their child put on a wait list

23:44.285 --> 23:45.950
for the Circle of Friends preschool,

23:45.951 --> 23:47.254
which is the finger paint feeder

23:47.255 --> 23:48.910
for all the best prep schools in DC.

23:48.911 --> 23:51.120
Hastings doesn't even have
a preschool-aged child.

23:51.121 --> 23:52.780
He will soon enough.

23:52.781 --> 23:55.091
His wife is six months pregnant.

23:58.991 --> 24:01.091
Damn it.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.160
Hey. I was just coming to find you.

24:06.161 --> 24:07.666
I have a draft. It's rough,

24:07.667 --> 24:09.823
- but I think it's pretty good.
- (sighs) The commencement speech.

24:09.824 --> 24:10.551
I-I can't.

24:10.552 --> 24:11.320
You can't what?

24:11.321 --> 24:13.990
I-I can't do it.
There's a lot going on.

24:13.991 --> 24:14.952
It's complicated.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.604
Bailing on them at this
point, all due respect,

24:17.605 --> 24:18.817
- is pretty rude.
- I'm not bailing on them.

24:18.818 --> 24:19.543
I'm sending you.

24:19.544 --> 24:20.558
Wait, wait, what?!

24:20.559 --> 24:23.160
Look, you wrote the speech.
It's all you.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.950
And, besides, the kids will
relate to you more. Thank you.

24:25.951 --> 24:27.950
I'll coordinate it. Just trust me.

24:27.951 --> 24:29.990
Madam Secretary, they're
really expecting you.

24:29.991 --> 24:31.870
I'm-I'm gonna be a big disappointment.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.910
Look, I'll make a
contribution to the school.

24:33.911 --> 24:36.080
I'll take individual
meetings with the graduates.

24:36.081 --> 24:37.910
- How many?
- 400.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.530
(sighs) We'll figure it out. And, Matt,

24:40.531 --> 24:42.950
you're not gonna be a disappointment.

24:42.951 --> 24:45.181
You're gonna crush it.

24:51.371 --> 24:52.370
Elise.

24:52.371 --> 24:54.530
Russell...

24:54.531 --> 24:57.530
(chuckling): Now that I'm
on the other side of this,

24:57.531 --> 24:59.120
it is pretty rude.

24:59.121 --> 25:00.370
We need to talk.

25:00.371 --> 25:03.370
Yes, we do.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.200
You need to drop the
Peter Buckley thing.

25:06.201 --> 25:10.080
Look, I have no idea why you'd want

25:10.081 --> 25:12.030
to give up a traitor to the Russians.

25:12.031 --> 25:15.160
All I know is that you have no
business even discussing this

25:15.161 --> 25:16.780
in the middle of an election.

25:16.781 --> 25:20.301
And why should I listen to
this when I'm losing my job?

25:22.161 --> 25:24.160
Yeah.

25:24.161 --> 25:26.820
Two can play at the omniscience game.

25:26.821 --> 25:29.240
I know that you are planning on offering

25:29.241 --> 25:31.820
my position to Calvin Hastings.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.971
(sighs) Look...

25:36.581 --> 25:38.449
I can't talk about this.

25:43.411 --> 25:46.341
You're not even denying it?

25:48.241 --> 25:51.580
You need to talk to the president, soon.

25:51.581 --> 25:54.280
He's in Chicago at a fund-raiser.

25:54.281 --> 25:56.080
He'll be back tomorrow.

25:56.081 --> 25:58.410
I'll get you a face-to-face with him.

25:58.411 --> 26:01.080
Don't bring up Buckley.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.160
We'll see about that.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.011
(door shuts)

26:10.121 --> 26:12.221
(sighs)

26:24.065 --> 26:25.394
HENRY: <i>We love Jareth.</i>

26:25.395 --> 26:27.184
We think he's a great guy.

26:27.185 --> 26:29.415
But you're rushing into
this marriage too quickly.

26:32.065 --> 26:33.014
No, just "rushing."

26:33.015 --> 26:35.564
"Rushing" is "quickly."
You don't need both.

26:35.565 --> 26:38.474
You're rushing into
this marriage. And why?

26:38.475 --> 26:39.814
Marriage is forever,

26:39.815 --> 26:41.758
and forever is a lot
longer than you think it is.

26:41.759 --> 26:43.644
This is stupid.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.474
Okay.

26:45.475 --> 26:48.354
Just go out there and start talking.

26:48.355 --> 26:49.814
It can't be that hard.

26:49.815 --> 26:51.354
STEVIE: <i>Yeah, but isn't an up-do,</i>

26:51.355 --> 26:52.520
like, too much going on?

26:52.521 --> 26:53.724
Not if it's casual,

26:53.725 --> 26:55.394
- like a modified ballerina bun
- Yeah.

26:55.395 --> 26:56.564
or a messy French twist.

26:56.565 --> 26:59.088
Oh, you mean the ones that
messy, like, have to look messy

26:59.089 --> 27:00.799
but you can't actually have
them be mess... (laughs)

27:00.800 --> 27:01.514
That's the magic.

27:01.515 --> 27:02.954
- Thank God you're here.
- Hey, Dad.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.354
Hey. It's just a dry run.

27:05.355 --> 27:07.684
Um, the big day is still on Saturday.

27:07.685 --> 27:09.724
You look beautiful.

27:09.725 --> 27:11.274
Noodle, could we have a minute?

27:11.275 --> 27:13.184
Of course.

27:13.185 --> 27:14.205
Thank you.

27:14.206 --> 27:15.274
(grunts)

27:15.275 --> 27:17.000
You look so beautiful. Seriously.

27:17.001 --> 27:18.825
Thanks, Ali.

27:20.185 --> 27:22.604
So...

27:22.605 --> 27:24.514
is this the big sentimental dad talk

27:24.515 --> 27:26.535
about sending me off into the world?

27:28.605 --> 27:29.705
Not exactly.

27:30.685 --> 27:32.665
Okay.

27:34.605 --> 27:36.814
Look...

27:36.815 --> 27:39.224
Mom and I are concerned that...

27:39.225 --> 27:41.325
It's too soon, isn't it?

27:45.395 --> 27:46.495
Yes.

27:50.395 --> 27:51.825
Oh, God.

27:54.355 --> 27:56.774
I was wondering when one
of you was gonna stop me

27:56.775 --> 27:59.564
from doing something incredibly...

27:59.565 --> 28:01.394
impulsive and stupid,

28:01.395 --> 28:04.394
which this does feel like it is.

28:04.395 --> 28:07.514
But at the same time...

28:07.515 --> 28:10.104
I love him, and...

28:10.105 --> 28:12.564
I don't want to lose him.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.495
And I know that he's the forever guy.

28:15.775 --> 28:18.684
I just don't know that I want
to start forever right now.

28:18.685 --> 28:21.564
Right. Because forever is a
lot longer than you think it is.

28:21.565 --> 28:25.224
I just didn't know what
to say when he proposed.

28:25.225 --> 28:28.564
I mean, people were watching.

28:28.565 --> 28:31.274
And it was so romantic!

28:31.275 --> 28:34.684
And he's the greatest guy... ever.

28:34.685 --> 28:39.455
Being willing to take
that risk, you know?

28:43.435 --> 28:46.434
Commitment is really hard to find in...

28:46.435 --> 28:48.274
people my age.

28:48.275 --> 28:49.705
Or anybody.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.745
How can I just throw all of that away?

29:01.685 --> 29:04.974
You don't have to.

29:04.975 --> 29:07.514
And you shouldn't.

29:07.515 --> 29:08.604
We love Jareth.

29:08.605 --> 29:09.750
(quiet laugh)

29:09.751 --> 29:10.934
Uh...

29:10.935 --> 29:13.604
We just think that...

29:13.605 --> 29:16.394
if you're willing to
commit to a life together,

29:16.395 --> 29:19.644
then that's not going anywhere.

29:19.645 --> 29:23.434
It'll stand the test of time.

29:23.435 --> 29:25.739
I'm speaking in clichés now,
exclusively. I just can't...

29:25.740 --> 29:26.514
That's okay.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.514
- Dad, you're a little freaked out.
- I am.

29:28.515 --> 29:29.875
So am I. (chuckles)

29:31.315 --> 29:32.644
Okay.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.285
♪ ♪

29:37.895 --> 29:40.474
(sighs)

29:40.475 --> 29:42.014
Tell me what you know, Bess.

29:42.015 --> 29:44.934
That you made an unofficial
offer to Calvin Hastings

29:44.935 --> 29:47.434
to replace me as secretary of state.

29:47.435 --> 29:50.564
Hastings hasn't unofficially accepted.

29:50.565 --> 29:52.331
I was hoping to bring
you into the circle

29:52.332 --> 29:54.035
- when the situation...
- I've been told by

29:54.036 --> 29:55.388
Foreign Minister Avdonin

29:55.389 --> 29:56.934
that Dmitri Petrov is alive.

29:56.935 --> 29:59.934
They'll give him his freedom
in exchange for Peter Buckley.

29:59.935 --> 30:02.615
(sighs) Here we go.

30:04.895 --> 30:06.375
Give us a moment.

30:11.395 --> 30:12.394
(door opens)

30:12.395 --> 30:14.495
(door shuts)

30:19.475 --> 30:20.894
You need to let this go.

30:20.895 --> 30:22.014
Not a chance.

30:22.015 --> 30:24.814
After everything that I have done

30:24.815 --> 30:26.564
in service to you and
this administration,

30:26.565 --> 30:29.724
only to find myself turned out

30:29.725 --> 30:32.811
at the first glimmer
of political expediency?

30:32.812 --> 30:33.313
Bess...

30:33.314 --> 30:36.854
Not to mention the sacrifices
my whole family made,

30:36.855 --> 30:39.854
especially Henry, who did
his best to put it behind him

30:39.855 --> 30:41.774
and support you after his own asset

30:41.775 --> 30:43.514
was surrendered to the greater good.

30:43.515 --> 30:46.774
Do you have any idea the
stress that put on us?

30:46.775 --> 30:50.724
We survived it because we did
have a bigger picture in mind,

30:50.725 --> 30:53.514
because we did serve
at the pleasure of a man

30:53.515 --> 30:55.684
we both respected

30:55.685 --> 30:58.104
and admired and trusted.

30:58.105 --> 30:59.934
And now this? You're firing me?

30:59.935 --> 31:02.934
Bess, I'm not firing you.

31:02.935 --> 31:05.705
I'm trying to ask you
to be my vice president.

31:07.435 --> 31:08.535
Oh.

31:11.015 --> 31:12.434
What?!

31:12.435 --> 31:15.774
Mark Delgado has serious health issues.

31:15.775 --> 31:18.314
It's just not a viable
job for him anymore.

31:18.315 --> 31:19.934
It was a very short list

31:19.935 --> 31:23.724
when it came to his replacement.

31:23.725 --> 31:26.035
Only one name on it.

31:29.605 --> 31:31.934
I'm going to need your
help on the campaign trail.

31:31.935 --> 31:36.514
But more importantly, I'm
going to need your wise counsel

31:36.515 --> 31:38.644
on all matters, foreign and domestic.

31:38.645 --> 31:40.474
I didn't want to bring you into this

31:40.475 --> 31:44.974
until I had a solid choice
for secretary of state.

31:44.975 --> 31:47.785
That person has some
pretty big shoes to fill.

31:48.725 --> 31:51.724
(sighing): Uh...

31:51.725 --> 31:54.724
Mr. President...

31:54.725 --> 31:57.825
I don't know what to say.

31:59.475 --> 32:01.644
First of all, thank you.

32:01.645 --> 32:03.564
Um...

32:03.565 --> 32:05.148
And I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

32:05.149 --> 32:07.434
It's quite all right.

32:07.435 --> 32:08.774
(trembling sigh)

32:08.775 --> 32:10.854
And then, um,

32:10.855 --> 32:14.684
I suppose I'll need some time to think.

32:14.685 --> 32:16.785
Of course.

32:24.145 --> 32:27.394
Sir, I-I'm not... I'm
not bargaining here.

32:27.395 --> 32:29.684
It's a separate issue, this
matter of Dmitri Petrov.

32:29.685 --> 32:31.509
It's out of the question.
American assets were

32:31.510 --> 32:33.684
sent to their deaths
when Buckley burned them.

32:33.685 --> 32:34.685
Two of them were friends.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.684
I know.

32:35.685 --> 32:38.283
As the former CIA director,
you know I can't begin

32:38.284 --> 32:41.242
to consider giving this
traitor his freedom.

32:41.243 --> 32:43.452
You also know that
Dmitri is probably dead.

32:43.453 --> 32:48.032
But while there's a
chance, we have to try.

32:48.033 --> 32:52.242
He was one of the most
effective assets we've ever had.

32:52.243 --> 32:54.612
His intel may have
prevented a world war.

32:54.613 --> 32:57.112
Meanwhile,

32:57.113 --> 33:01.213
Buckley is no longer a
threat to American security.

33:03.203 --> 33:06.162
But besides all that,

33:06.163 --> 33:07.612
you know in your heart of hearts

33:07.613 --> 33:08.702
that giving up Dmitri

33:08.703 --> 33:12.322
to make that deal with Russia was wrong.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.662
It was a necessary wrong.

33:14.663 --> 33:17.162
But it was wrong.

33:17.163 --> 33:20.372
Here we have a chance to make it right.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.553
How often do we get that?

33:24.703 --> 33:26.202
Here I am, offering you

33:26.203 --> 33:27.986
the second most important
job in the country,

33:27.987 --> 33:28.662
(laughs)

33:28.663 --> 33:31.492
and you're poking at my conscience.

33:31.493 --> 33:34.343
Any wonder why I want
you to take the job?

33:41.283 --> 33:44.093
Well, it looks like we both
have a lot to think about.

33:52.526 --> 33:54.525
JARETH: <i>So, for the wedding reception,</i>

33:54.526 --> 33:57.525
plenty of room for mingling
but not too cavernous.

33:57.526 --> 34:00.935
Got craft beers on tap,
nice wine selection,

34:00.936 --> 34:02.565
all the small batch liquors.

34:02.566 --> 34:04.605
Walks right up to precious,

34:04.606 --> 34:06.265
and then says, no, wait,

34:06.266 --> 34:07.706
sophisticated.

34:08.976 --> 34:10.935
Yeah.

34:10.936 --> 34:12.706
It's nice.

34:14.396 --> 34:17.225
Okay, so...

34:17.226 --> 34:18.685
why does it look like you're being

34:18.686 --> 34:19.956
led to your execution?

34:23.565 --> 34:26.725
It's, uh, it's too soon.

34:26.726 --> 34:28.264
What?

34:28.266 --> 34:29.185
For getting married.

34:29.186 --> 34:30.905
- Yes, no, I put that together.
- Jareth...

34:30.906 --> 34:32.895
I love you so much.

34:32.896 --> 34:36.576
And I love the idea of
marrying you, it's...

34:37.976 --> 34:40.815
...just every time I th... I think about

34:40.815 --> 34:43.565
actually doing it, I...

34:43.565 --> 34:46.605
I kind of feel like...

34:46.606 --> 34:48.895
throwing up or-or passing out,

34:48.896 --> 34:51.395
and-and that's not how I really

34:51.396 --> 34:52.331
want to feel.

34:52.331 --> 34:53.366
No, that's not ideal.

34:54.315 --> 34:56.025
So why can't we wait?

34:56.025 --> 34:57.685
Of course we can.

34:57.686 --> 35:00.525
It's just when I think of
being separated from you

35:00.526 --> 35:03.666
for that long without
some kind of plan...

35:04.896 --> 35:06.525
I don't want to risk it.

35:06.526 --> 35:08.685
So...

35:08.686 --> 35:09.536
let's make a plan.

35:10.646 --> 35:13.645
I will finish out my semester here

35:13.646 --> 35:16.855
and then I'll jo...
I'll join you in Oxford

35:16.856 --> 35:17.916
for the summer.

35:18.856 --> 35:20.626
We can, we can live in a...

35:22.066 --> 35:24.565
...charming little cottage and...

35:24.566 --> 35:26.645
go punting...

35:26.646 --> 35:28.149
Probably more like a sad little flat.

35:28.150 --> 35:29.395
But I do know how to punt.

35:29.396 --> 35:31.435
Well, I didn't actually
know that was a real thing,

35:31.436 --> 35:32.539
it just sounded good, so...

35:32.540 --> 35:34.640
And after our idyllic summer?

35:36.526 --> 35:40.036
We... we figure it out. Together.

35:41.726 --> 35:43.025
I like the together bit.

35:43.026 --> 35:44.866
Me, too.

35:51.436 --> 35:52.475
HENRY: <i>Babe?</i>

35:52.476 --> 35:54.025
Text from Stevie.

35:54.026 --> 35:57.645
"Wedding off, engagement
on, explain later."

35:57.646 --> 35:59.685
Oh, thank God.

35:59.686 --> 36:03.765
"P.S. summer in Oxford."

36:03.766 --> 36:06.105
Sounds expensive.

36:06.106 --> 36:07.355
(chuckles)

36:07.356 --> 36:09.645
Still, nice save, Professor.

36:09.646 --> 36:12.576
Well, believe me, she was
ready for the intervention.

36:13.976 --> 36:15.956
I need to tell you something.

36:16.896 --> 36:18.725
Couple of things, actually.

36:18.726 --> 36:20.126
Yeah?

36:22.686 --> 36:25.475
There's a chance Dmitri's still alive.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.605
What?

36:27.606 --> 36:29.065
How?

36:29.066 --> 36:30.815
I'm told the Russians preserved him

36:30.816 --> 36:33.725
in the event of a chance
for a prisoner exchange,

36:33.726 --> 36:36.525
and now that chance is here.

36:36.526 --> 36:39.395
Avdonin wants to swap
him for Peter Buckley.

36:39.396 --> 36:41.685
Took some convincing,

36:41.686 --> 36:44.145
but Conrad's agreed to the trade.

36:44.146 --> 36:45.475
He's alive.

36:45.476 --> 36:47.855
The whole thing could be a ploy.

36:47.856 --> 36:49.065
I mean, all accessible proof,

36:49.066 --> 36:51.605
everything except Avdonin's word,

36:51.606 --> 36:52.765
speaks to the contrary,

36:52.766 --> 36:56.206
and the Russians could just
be playing us to get Buckley.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.935
We wouldn't know for certain
until the actual exchange.

37:00.936 --> 37:04.145
When is it?

37:04.146 --> 37:05.475
Tomorrow night.

37:05.476 --> 37:06.765
Where?

37:06.766 --> 37:08.815
Vartius, Finland.

37:08.816 --> 37:10.956
Border checkpoint with Russia.

37:13.106 --> 37:14.895
We need someone there

37:14.896 --> 37:16.475
who can identify him.

37:16.476 --> 37:17.475
It has to be me.

37:17.476 --> 37:19.379
Do you really want to
put yourself through that?

37:19.380 --> 37:22.725
If it isn't real, what's
that gonna do to you?

37:22.726 --> 37:25.895
Y-you have to consider that, Henry.

37:25.896 --> 37:30.536
In your best ex-CIA estimation,
what are the odds he's alive?

37:32.566 --> 37:33.855
Forty-five percent.

37:33.856 --> 37:36.126
I have to go.

37:40.896 --> 37:42.666
Okay.

37:44.066 --> 37:47.036
Then we need to pack.

37:47.976 --> 37:49.895
What was the other thing?

37:49.896 --> 37:52.895
Oh...

37:52.896 --> 37:55.475
Conrad asked me to
be his Vice President.

37:55.476 --> 37:56.935
Oh... what?

37:56.936 --> 38:00.565
ELIZABETH: Yeah, big day.

38:00.566 --> 38:01.705
MATT: <i>Uh, good morning.</i>

38:01.706 --> 38:02.537
(feedback whines)

38:02.538 --> 38:04.161
- MAN: Good morning.
- I'd like to, uh...

38:04.162 --> 38:06.605
(stammers)

38:06.606 --> 38:10.036
uh, begin by stating the obvious.

38:11.106 --> 38:15.706
I am not Elizabeth McCord.

38:17.936 --> 38:20.536
I'm her speechwriter.

38:21.936 --> 38:24.855
Believe me, uh, no one
is more disappointed that

38:24.856 --> 38:26.855
the secretary won't
be giving the address

38:26.856 --> 38:28.565
that I wrote for her.

38:28.566 --> 38:29.855
You know, now that I know

38:29.856 --> 38:31.399
that it'll never see the light of day,

38:31.400 --> 38:33.935
I think it's safe to say that

38:33.936 --> 38:35.645
it was the greatest speech ever written.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.645
(audience laughs)

38:37.646 --> 38:39.855
I mean, honestly, uh,

38:39.856 --> 38:43.265
this is probably the first
moment in my adult life

38:43.266 --> 38:45.996
that I've stood in the spotlight.

38:47.266 --> 38:50.666
Truth be told, it's
probably gonna be the last.

38:51.856 --> 38:54.145
Why?

38:54.146 --> 38:58.025
Because I'm one of those
people who works in the dark.

38:58.026 --> 39:00.025
I know what you're thinking.

39:00.026 --> 39:04.025
As soon as my Etsy
page is discovered, uh,

39:04.026 --> 39:07.525
I'll invent my own job title
on Buzzfeed and livestream

39:07.526 --> 39:09.935
my Christopher Walken
impression as I hoverboard

39:09.936 --> 39:11.975
to the Soylent dispenser
in the playroom...

39:11.976 --> 39:13.935
(audience laughs)

39:13.936 --> 39:15.225
...and I don't blame you.

39:15.226 --> 39:20.605
In this world of
relentless self-promotion,

39:20.606 --> 39:23.935
we've all been raised to
think that the limelight

39:23.936 --> 39:26.326
is the only light worth seeking.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.286
But that isn't the case.

39:33.106 --> 39:36.605
And if I can impart one thing today,

39:36.606 --> 39:41.025
a small, simple truth to carry with you

39:41.026 --> 39:44.126
as you walk through
those gates, it's this:

39:46.766 --> 39:50.206
<i>Achievement is often anonymous.</i>
