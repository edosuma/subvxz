09:06.826 --> 09:09.364
Look, we could do this all day.
Why don't we split up

09:09.364 --> 09:11.970
and try to find the bang sticks?
(clicks tongue)
Yeah.

09:11.970 --> 09:14.775
And who shot his friend?
Maybe I can get some tips.
Uh‐huh.

09:14.775 --> 09:16.378
♪ You ain't got to work ♪

09:16.378 --> 09:18.917
♪ All you got to do
is put your back into it... ♪

09:18.917 --> 09:20.386
(whistles)

09:20.386 --> 09:23.860
Whoa, 305 V‐8.

09:23.860 --> 09:27.300
15‐inch radials with spinners.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.406
You are one hot

09:30.406 --> 09:33.078
piece of American pie.

09:33.078 --> 09:34.615
Why, thank you.

09:35.684 --> 09:37.320
I was talking about the car.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.923
I know.

09:38.923 --> 09:40.961
I like a man who appreciates
the classics,

09:40.961 --> 09:42.898
even if he is a cop.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.438
You the owner of
that fine‐ass Harley?

09:46.438 --> 09:49.177
You don't ever own a Harley.

09:49.177 --> 09:52.050
The Harley owns you.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.385
Heritage Softail.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.189
Twin cam engine.

09:55.189 --> 09:57.226
Dark, slim <i>and</i> smooth.

09:57.226 --> 09:59.832
Huh. Just how I like it.

09:59.832 --> 10:02.203
Uh, yeah, um...

10:02.203 --> 10:03.873
getting to the point.

10:03.873 --> 10:06.478
Uh, you might know something
about some stolen guns?

10:06.478 --> 10:08.883
Ah. You want to
talk to Booker.

10:08.883 --> 10:11.823
Ever since Carlo got got,
he's the man in charge.

10:11.823 --> 10:13.125
He over there.

10:14.494 --> 10:16.231
(indistinct chatter)

10:16.231 --> 10:17.901
Hey! This looks like fun.

10:17.901 --> 10:19.505
You guys mind if I play?

10:19.505 --> 10:22.009
Uh, sorry, buddy,
this game is full.

10:22.009 --> 10:23.780
Oh, that's all right.
Look, I, uh...

10:23.780 --> 10:25.784
brought my own tiles.

10:25.784 --> 10:27.286
Oh, there we go.
What the hell is this?

10:27.286 --> 10:29.324
Coming up in here
dropping Chinese Scrabble.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.794
No, that's mah‐jongg.

10:30.794 --> 10:32.063
Fun as hell.

10:32.063 --> 10:33.398
My man knows
what's up.

10:33.398 --> 10:35.269
Man, this dude's a cop.

10:35.269 --> 10:37.541
LAPD must have lowered the bar
on that entrance exam, huh?

10:37.541 --> 10:39.912
Yeah, well,
it is multiple choice.

10:39.912 --> 10:41.414
Right? One gets lucky.

10:41.414 --> 10:43.152
(chuckles)
Well, Officer,

10:43.152 --> 10:45.456
if you plan on arresting us
for betting on dominoes,

10:45.456 --> 10:47.026
can you do it now?

10:47.026 --> 10:49.297
'Cause I'm up, like,
50 bucks on these fools.

10:49.297 --> 10:50.600
(all chuckling)

10:50.600 --> 10:52.370
Look, I got a bet.

10:52.370 --> 10:56.478
I bet you know where I can find
about 400 stolen weapons.

10:57.581 --> 10:59.985
Can't help you there.

10:59.985 --> 11:02.256
All right, let me double down.

11:02.256 --> 11:04.528
I bet that 9mm you're holding

11:04.528 --> 11:06.064
matches the weapon
that shot Carlo.

11:09.437 --> 11:11.474
What's he talking about?

11:11.474 --> 11:13.045
Oh, wait a minute.

11:13.045 --> 11:14.882
You‐you didn't
tell these guys?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.151
Oh, look, here's the thing.

11:16.151 --> 11:18.556
I... I don't fault
the impulse, okay?

11:18.556 --> 11:19.892
That, I get.

11:19.892 --> 11:21.896
But shooting him in the back...

11:21.896 --> 11:24.434
Dang, bud, that's
cold‐blooded.

11:33.352 --> 11:34.454
WOMAN:
Oh!

11:36.458 --> 11:38.462
(people shouting)

11:38.462 --> 11:39.999
MAN:
Hey, man.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.502
(horn honks, tires screech)

11:41.502 --> 11:44.140
(shouting)

11:44.140 --> 11:46.411
(shouting continues)

11:54.160 --> 11:56.532
Hey, look...
the guns are secure, all right?

11:56.532 --> 11:57.668
I'm a cop.

11:57.668 --> 11:59.103
You're a cop?

11:59.103 --> 12:00.907
Not so loud.

12:00.907 --> 12:02.243
Look, you are messing with
a federal operation.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.513
There he is.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.215
Here, quick, just hit me.

12:05.215 --> 12:06.619
Wait, wait a minute.
What now?

12:06.619 --> 12:08.388
Hit me, man.
To protect my cover.

12:10.627 --> 12:12.063
And make it
look good.

12:13.498 --> 12:16.071
MAN: Oh!
Huh.
WOMAN: Oh!

12:17.507 --> 12:19.878
Came out of nowhere.
For real?

12:19.878 --> 12:21.615
(handcuffs tighten)

12:21.615 --> 12:23.553
Good job, Rog.
TOYA: Hey.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.289
Aren't you gonna
give me your number?

12:25.289 --> 12:26.625
My number, baby?

12:26.625 --> 12:28.028
Mm‐hmm.

12:28.028 --> 12:29.999
911.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.101
(Riggs groans)

12:35.643 --> 12:38.248
How many times
do I have to say it?

12:38.248 --> 12:40.119
We're not gonna put
a hard number on that, are we?

12:40.119 --> 12:41.655
Nope.

12:41.655 --> 12:44.394
I shot Carlo because
he was about to shoot a uni.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.464
You know what, you're welcome.

12:46.464 --> 12:48.201
He's a nutjob.
Uh‐huh.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.470
Yeah, that's delightful.

12:49.470 --> 12:50.940
But the guns.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.145
Where are the guns?

12:53.145 --> 12:55.617
You will get the guns
when I'm done with the op.

12:55.617 --> 12:57.086
Now, if you
keep me here,

12:57.086 --> 12:58.556
a major arms dealer

12:58.556 --> 13:00.092
is just gonna skate away.

13:00.092 --> 13:02.296
Right, 'cause you're
an "undercover cop."

13:02.296 --> 13:04.902
(chuckles)

13:04.902 --> 13:06.237
I'm ATF.

13:06.237 --> 13:07.574
Hmm.

13:07.574 --> 13:09.177
Now, do you need me
to spell that for you?

13:09.177 --> 13:10.379
Wow. All right,
that's the best

13:10.379 --> 13:11.515
alibi I've heard all day.

13:11.515 --> 13:13.285
You win the coffee.

13:13.285 --> 13:15.022
ATF. Nobody's ever
come in here

13:15.022 --> 13:16.391
and sat down
and said that.

13:16.391 --> 13:18.328
(sniffs)
Ugh, man.

13:18.328 --> 13:19.397
Precinct swill.

13:19.397 --> 13:21.301
It's off‐brand Maxwell House.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.438
It's the cutbacks of 2016,
right?

13:23.438 --> 13:25.610
And I think
I believe him.

13:25.610 --> 13:27.146
Because he smelled
the coffee?

13:27.146 --> 13:28.348
He knew about the
cutbacks of 2016.

13:28.348 --> 13:29.952
There's always cutbacks.

13:29.952 --> 13:32.022
Look, buddy,

13:32.022 --> 13:34.227
I've seen undercover.

13:34.227 --> 13:37.233
I know
undercover.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.239
You are not undercover.

13:40.239 --> 13:41.174
(knocking on glass)

13:42.978 --> 13:44.515
Be right back.

13:44.515 --> 13:47.052
AVERY:
<i>I got a call. He's ATF.</i>

13:47.052 --> 13:49.758
Oh, he's ATF.

13:49.758 --> 13:52.998
But posing as
a gang member.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.535
What do they call that again?

13:54.535 --> 13:56.371
I just don't understand
how I missed it.

13:56.371 --> 13:58.676
Undercover!
Well, undercover
or not,

13:58.676 --> 14:00.479
stealing guns from
our backyard, not cool.

14:00.479 --> 14:01.682
The ATF's gonna
hear from this guy.

14:01.682 --> 14:05.055
Undercover's supposed
to smell undercover.

14:05.055 --> 14:06.959
My compass must be off.

14:06.959 --> 14:08.963
What's he babbling about?
Just don't.

14:08.963 --> 14:10.299
Just‐‐ no, don't‐don't ask.

14:10.299 --> 14:12.236
Oh, no. Really?

14:12.236 --> 14:14.307
Rog, have you
ever been undercover?

14:16.444 --> 14:18.583
Not just undercover.

14:18.583 --> 14:22.122
Deep,
deep undercover.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.126
(sighs)
It was two weeks.

14:24.126 --> 14:26.231
Undercover as what?

14:26.231 --> 14:29.370
Randy Drexler,

14:29.370 --> 14:32.510
a journeyman used car salesman.

14:32.510 --> 14:34.113
The youngest
of six children.

14:34.113 --> 14:35.415
Randy grew up poor

14:35.415 --> 14:38.355
in a cabin built
by his grandpappy

14:38.355 --> 14:40.092
just outside of Reno.

14:40.092 --> 14:41.427
Created a whole
character bio.

14:41.427 --> 14:42.764
For two weeks, we
had to call him Randy.

14:42.764 --> 14:44.568
Yeah, because
I was Randy!

14:44.568 --> 14:49.645
A gifted salesman with
questionable moral judgment.

14:49.645 --> 14:51.815
You know,
Randy took down

14:51.815 --> 14:54.453
an entire criminal enterprise.

14:54.453 --> 14:56.190
It was a chop shop in El Monte.

14:56.190 --> 14:58.461
And helped
a certain unnamed actor

14:58.461 --> 15:01.200
win his second Academy Award.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.242
Denzel went on a
ride‐along with Randy.

15:05.242 --> 15:07.246
Mm‐hmm. Yep. But he didn't

15:07.246 --> 15:09.417
even thank Randy
or I at the Oscars.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.287
What's he doing?

15:11.287 --> 15:12.356
I don't know.

15:12.356 --> 15:14.427
Hopefully a sequel to <i>Glory.</i>

15:14.427 --> 15:16.431
Not Denzel.

15:16.431 --> 15:18.636
Bowman, what are you doing?

15:18.636 --> 15:21.107
Ah, there you are.
I got that name for you.

15:21.107 --> 15:22.777
The one harassing Ruthie.
He's still
seeing Ruthie?

15:22.777 --> 15:24.447
Yeah. I think
it's purely sexual.

15:24.447 --> 15:25.382
Ugh.
Uh,

15:25.382 --> 15:27.186
his name's Teddy Malkin.

15:27.186 --> 15:28.522
He's a repo man.

15:31.829 --> 15:33.599
<i>(tow truck whirring)</i>

15:33.599 --> 15:34.601
Ted Malkin?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.471
Is this your car?

15:36.471 --> 15:37.741
Take it up with your bank, pal.

15:37.741 --> 15:39.310
Two steps back
or we're gonna have a problem.

15:39.310 --> 15:42.216
Yeah, this is not
my vehicle, Teddy,

15:42.216 --> 15:43.853
but we do have a problem.

15:43.853 --> 15:46.090
See, you been hunting
down Ruthie Krumholz.

15:46.090 --> 15:47.459
I need you to lose
her paperwork.

15:47.459 --> 15:48.863
Ruthie Krumholz?

15:48.863 --> 15:51.635
You're talking to me
about Ruthie Krumholz?

15:51.635 --> 15:53.304
I don't like the way
you keep saying her name.

15:53.304 --> 15:55.175
(sighs) Mom, where do
you find these guys?

15:55.175 --> 15:57.747
What are you‐‐ let me
guess‐‐ spoken word poet?

15:57.747 --> 15:59.183
What did you just say?

15:59.183 --> 16:00.586
Sorry, sorry, didn't
mean to offend.

16:00.586 --> 16:01.655
Twig furniture maker?

16:02.724 --> 16:04.661
Wait, Ruthie's your mother?

16:06.431 --> 16:08.803
She never mentioned
she had kids.

16:08.803 --> 16:11.340
Makes it easier to pretend
she doesn't.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.478
So, you called her this morning

16:13.478 --> 16:15.348
and you're the one that freaked
her out. What was it you said?

16:17.286 --> 16:20.492
My mother uses
my mailing address.

16:20.492 --> 16:23.097
Every collection
agent, IRS auditor

16:23.097 --> 16:25.235
that tries to
reach her finds me.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.774
I called to tell her that
the City of L. A. sent a bill

16:27.774 --> 16:29.711
for 1,800 parking tickets.

16:29.711 --> 16:31.582
I asked if she needed money.

16:31.582 --> 16:33.451
Money?

16:33.451 --> 16:36.892
I know. I'm a
real dick, right?

16:36.892 --> 16:39.396
How long you known my mom?

16:39.396 --> 16:40.600
Two or three weeks.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.406
Two or three weeks?

16:44.406 --> 16:48.147
So you overheard
a phone call

16:48.147 --> 16:50.352
and then took it upon yourself
to trace the number,

16:50.352 --> 16:53.424
track me down,
and confront me all because...?

16:58.401 --> 17:00.405
I didn't want her to leave.

17:00.405 --> 17:02.610
Wow.

17:02.610 --> 17:04.113
Dude,

17:04.113 --> 17:07.787
if you're holding on
to her that tight,

17:07.787 --> 17:09.758
I think I just met
the one person

17:09.758 --> 17:11.460
more dysfunctional than she is.

17:19.476 --> 17:22.750
Brooks Avery, the
disappointment of Delta Tau.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.486
Blum.

17:24.486 --> 17:26.692
You're still with the ATF?
(chuckles)

17:26.692 --> 17:31.233
Try newly appointed special
agent in charge of Los Angeles.

17:31.233 --> 17:32.937
You didn't read about
it in the class notes?

17:32.937 --> 17:35.308
The alumni newsletter?

17:35.308 --> 17:36.578
Yeah, no, no one reads that.

17:36.578 --> 17:37.647
Where's Booker?

17:37.647 --> 17:38.916
I want my guy back.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.553
I want my weapons back.

17:40.553 --> 17:42.657
The weapons LAPD lost?

17:42.657 --> 17:45.663
The weapons ATF stole in some
half‐assed undercover operation.

17:45.663 --> 17:47.800
(sighs)
The ATF

17:47.800 --> 17:52.309
doesn't sanction covert
robberies of the LAPD, okay?

17:52.309 --> 17:53.812
There was no
undercover operation.

17:53.812 --> 17:55.315
Your‐your guy Booker said...

17:55.315 --> 17:57.319
My guy is a lunatic.

17:57.319 --> 17:59.557
He said he's been undercover,
chasing some arms dealer.

17:59.557 --> 18:00.860
Luther Strickland.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.429
It was only supposed
to last six months.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.567
Then Strickland shoots
Booker's partner.

18:04.567 --> 18:06.505
Booker then goes
off the deep end.

18:06.505 --> 18:07.774
I can't control him.

18:07.774 --> 18:09.176
And now it's like
he's his own boss.

18:09.176 --> 18:11.113
And since then,
the job has been...

18:12.249 --> 18:13.384
Yep. Been there.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.721
Please.

18:14.721 --> 18:17.392
You have no idea
what it's like trying to manage

18:17.392 --> 18:18.929
a certifiable maniac for years.

18:18.929 --> 18:20.966
Trust me, I do.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.872
I have a stress‐induced hiatal
hernia the size of a melon.

18:23.872 --> 18:25.876
My chiropractor says
this job is giving me

18:25.876 --> 18:27.947
the posture
of a 16th‐century serf.

18:27.947 --> 18:29.450
I'm growing a hunch.

18:29.450 --> 18:30.953
My guy's worse.

18:30.953 --> 18:32.623
I'm gonna get
a character witness.

18:32.623 --> 18:34.594
Hey, Bowman!

18:34.594 --> 18:36.565
Send Murtaugh
in here.

18:41.575 --> 18:43.846
Can you hurry up, dude?

18:43.846 --> 18:46.450
I do have places to be.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.591
It's possible that
you have not torpedoed

18:49.591 --> 18:51.260
my entire operation yet.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.897
There is no operation.

18:52.897 --> 18:54.466
(scoffs)

18:54.466 --> 18:56.605
You want to help me,
tell me where the guns are.

18:56.605 --> 18:59.009
My God, man,
are you really back to this?

18:59.009 --> 19:01.280
You just spoke
to my handler, right?

19:01.280 --> 19:02.482
Yeah, we talked.

19:02.482 --> 19:04.219
As a matter of fact,

19:04.219 --> 19:05.890
he's here now to take you in.

19:05.890 --> 19:07.693
(chuckles) Please, Blum is...
(door opens)

19:07.693 --> 19:09.998
Come on, let's go.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.302
(grunts)

19:14.507 --> 19:16.611
Look, did he tell you that
Strickland killed my partner?

19:16.611 --> 19:18.615
He did.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.251
And I'm sorry.

19:20.251 --> 19:22.523
I understand
why you went off the rails.

19:22.523 --> 19:23.759
Been there myself.

19:23.759 --> 19:25.328
But it's over.

19:25.328 --> 19:28.735
Your only play is to tell me
where the guns are.

19:35.749 --> 19:38.221
Looks like I got a
couple of plays left.

19:39.824 --> 19:41.828
BOOKER:
Everybody stay back!

19:41.828 --> 19:42.964
Stay back!

19:42.964 --> 19:44.801
Oh, my good God.

19:44.801 --> 19:45.803
Stay back!

19:45.803 --> 19:46.905
OFFICER:
Put the weapon down!

19:46.905 --> 19:48.642
Booker!
Move!

19:48.642 --> 19:50.311
Booker.
Everybody calm down!

19:51.581 --> 19:53.451
Roger, you okay?

19:53.451 --> 19:54.988
Fine. Why do you ask?

19:54.988 --> 19:56.791
You be smart, Booker.

19:56.791 --> 19:57.793
(dings)

20:04.473 --> 20:07.880
(alarm buzzes)
You should think
about what you're doing.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.020
You know, if I thought about it,
I probably wouldn't do it.

20:11.020 --> 20:12.990
(chuckles)

20:12.990 --> 20:14.994
Undercover life.

20:14.994 --> 20:17.600
Every day's an adventure,
am I right?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.504
Booker, stand down.
This is not gonna end well.

20:19.504 --> 20:20.973
Surrender that weapon.

20:20.973 --> 20:22.643
What the heck's going on?

20:22.643 --> 20:25.315
His lunatic took Murtaugh
hostage in the elevator.

20:28.154 --> 20:29.857
Who is that?

20:29.857 --> 20:30.893
My lunatic.

20:30.893 --> 20:32.863
(elevator dings)

20:46.490 --> 20:47.425
(whirring)

21:10.405 --> 21:11.775
Well, Booker,

21:11.775 --> 21:15.549
I know you're not
gonna shoot a cop.

21:15.549 --> 21:16.551
So what's your plan?

21:16.551 --> 21:17.653
I don't know.

21:17.653 --> 21:18.955
What would you do?

21:18.955 --> 21:21.561
I don't know.
Me, I'd probably...

21:21.561 --> 21:23.565
climb down, turn myself in.

21:23.565 --> 21:25.569
Yeah, you know what,

21:25.569 --> 21:27.372
I don't think you would.

21:28.909 --> 21:31.581
And I don't think I will either.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.123
Riggs!

21:36.123 --> 21:37.960
Figure you
got about

21:37.960 --> 21:39.664
30 seconds to save your partner.

21:47.078 --> 21:49.216
Well, look who
decided to drop in.

21:49.216 --> 21:50.686
Everything all right
with Ruthie?

21:52.088 --> 21:54.694
Would you like to talk
about this now, or...

21:54.694 --> 21:56.163
I'd like to talk about
this in the break room.

21:56.163 --> 21:57.700
If you could just‐‐
I don't have the key.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.835
I got a key.
Watch your eyes.

22:03.812 --> 22:05.047
(both grunting)

22:06.083 --> 22:07.385
Come on, Rog.

22:10.859 --> 22:12.796
(shouting)

22:14.667 --> 22:16.938
(elevator crashes)
You know what?

22:16.938 --> 22:18.140
If Trish calls tonight,

22:18.140 --> 22:20.546
you might not want
to mention this.

22:20.546 --> 22:21.614
Yeah.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.564
ROGER JR.: <i>Yo, Dad, this is the</i>
<i>best macaroni and cheese ever.</i>

22:29.564 --> 22:31.634
Well, it's the
breadcrumbs.

22:31.634 --> 22:33.170
Your mother doesn't seem
to like them.

22:33.170 --> 22:35.509
But in this house,
we are all

22:35.509 --> 22:37.646
captains of our own ship.
Captains of our own ship.

22:37.646 --> 22:39.182
Got it.
Very well said, son.

22:39.182 --> 22:41.186
Good, very good.

22:41.186 --> 22:42.856
Here. Take these.

22:42.856 --> 22:46.129
Why, aren't you
the sweet one?
No.

22:46.129 --> 22:48.300
You are. You're giving them
to mom when she gets home.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.273
Why, pray tell, would I do that?

22:51.273 --> 22:54.012
'Cause this has gone on
long enough, Dad.

22:54.012 --> 22:55.649
Okay, look what
you're doing to RJ.

22:55.649 --> 22:57.886
He's having two
dinners every night.

22:57.886 --> 22:59.657
Wh‐‐ you've been eating
with your mother, too?

22:59.657 --> 23:01.159
Don't drag me into this.

23:01.159 --> 23:02.596
RIANA:
Mm‐hmm.

23:02.596 --> 23:03.965
I'm only here for the free food.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.969
Judas.
RIANA:
Dad.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.575
You left your bike in the
middle of the driveway.

23:08.575 --> 23:10.579
You're trying
to provoke her.

23:10.579 --> 23:13.785
No, I'm trying to set an
example for my children.

23:13.785 --> 23:16.891
There comes a time when
a man must plant his flag.

23:16.891 --> 23:20.131
And he must hold firm
to that flag,

23:20.131 --> 23:21.934
consequences be damned.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.470
(car crashes outside)

23:25.642 --> 23:27.680
I think Mom just
ran over your flag.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.219
MURTAUGH:
<i>You murdered my bike.</i>

23:31.219 --> 23:33.958
You hit her on purpose.

23:35.562 --> 23:37.833
Roger, it was dark,

23:37.833 --> 23:41.641
and you left it in the
middle of the driveway.

23:41.641 --> 23:44.914
Vehicles belong in the driveway.

23:44.914 --> 23:47.853
That is why they're
called "driveways."

23:49.657 --> 23:52.228
It was an innocent accident.

23:52.228 --> 23:53.965
Oh, was it?

23:53.965 --> 23:56.203
<i>Art of War,</i> chapter 11.

23:56.203 --> 23:59.844
"Destroy that which
the enemy holds dear."

24:01.647 --> 24:05.789
Oh, so you think
this is a war.

24:05.789 --> 24:07.626
Who's winning, Roger?

24:07.626 --> 24:09.329
You know what?
The joke is on you,

24:09.329 --> 24:12.068
because when I report you,
and I will,

24:12.068 --> 24:13.838
your insurance rates
are gonna go up.

24:19.784 --> 24:21.086
I can afford it.

24:24.994 --> 24:26.062
<i>(elevator dings)</i>

24:29.937 --> 24:33.277
Martin Ellis Riggs, what the
hell is wrong with you?

24:33.277 --> 24:34.680
That's not my middle name.

24:34.680 --> 24:38.086
You booted my RV.

24:38.086 --> 24:41.961
No, you booted your RV by not
paying those parking tickets.

24:41.961 --> 24:43.765
You know, when the cop told me

24:43.765 --> 24:45.836
that a mustachioed detective
ratted me out,

24:45.836 --> 24:48.641
I‐I figured, sure, another one
of Tom Selleck's pranks,

24:48.641 --> 24:50.779
but no, it was you.

24:50.779 --> 24:52.783
Why?

24:52.783 --> 24:55.054
Vehicular truancy
is a serious offense.

24:55.054 --> 24:57.058
You had 1,800
parking tickets.

24:57.058 --> 24:58.795
What am I supposed
to do with that?

24:58.795 --> 24:59.897
How'd you find out about that?

25:02.268 --> 25:04.105
A concerned citizen.

25:04.105 --> 25:06.076
A concerned citizen?
A concerned citizen.

25:06.076 --> 25:08.080
Who would even
know that I...?

25:08.080 --> 25:11.253
Oh, my God. You...

25:11.253 --> 25:13.257
You talked to my son?

25:16.831 --> 25:19.703
Okay. How'd you find him?

25:19.703 --> 25:21.908
I would love to tell you that,
but, technically,

25:21.908 --> 25:23.845
that would be a violation
of the Fourth Amendment.

25:23.845 --> 25:25.982
You had no right
to do that.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.653
Look, I thought you
were in trouble.

25:27.653 --> 25:29.790
Okay?
So you tried to keep
me here with a boot.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.259
Look, I‐I didn't know,
Ruthie.

25:31.259 --> 25:33.798
I thought you were in trouble,
okay? You‐you were scared

25:33.798 --> 25:35.669
when you came in
from that phone call.

25:35.669 --> 25:37.305
I'm not scared, Marty, you are.

25:37.305 --> 25:38.942
Scared of what?

25:38.942 --> 25:40.879
That when I go,
you'll be all alone.

25:40.879 --> 25:43.350
All right.
And on those
quiet nights,

25:43.350 --> 25:45.287
in that empty tin coffin,

25:45.287 --> 25:47.893
you won't have
anybody or anything

25:47.893 --> 25:50.297
to keep you from
falling off the wagon.

25:50.297 --> 25:53.170
Or worse.

25:53.170 --> 25:55.207
I'm not your crutch, Marty.

25:55.207 --> 25:57.044
I wasn't put here to save you.

25:57.044 --> 26:00.317
I never asked you to.

26:00.317 --> 26:02.021
Good.

26:02.021 --> 26:05.027
Because some people
are beyond saving.

26:17.084 --> 26:18.387
MAN (on recording): ...one the
ancients called "The Fighter,"

26:18.387 --> 26:20.090
is one who not only wins,

26:20.090 --> 26:22.863
but excels in winning with ease.

26:22.863 --> 26:24.900
He who knows when he can fight,

26:24.900 --> 26:26.704
and when he cannot...
(phone rings)

26:26.704 --> 26:29.242
...will be victorious.

26:31.781 --> 26:33.851
Murtaugh, how's the stakeout?

26:33.851 --> 26:35.722
Did Blum's tip pay off?

26:35.722 --> 26:39.262
He who is prudent lies in wait.

26:39.262 --> 26:40.431
For the love of God,
when are you

26:40.431 --> 26:41.934
gonna be done with that book?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.738
I think Booker just led me
to the truck

26:43.738 --> 26:44.773
from the gun buyback.

26:44.773 --> 26:46.009
Any guns in that truck?

26:46.009 --> 26:48.881
No idea, but the truck's
on the move.

26:48.881 --> 26:50.919
(engine starts)
Any word from Riggs?

26:50.919 --> 26:52.789
No, not yet.

26:52.789 --> 26:53.891
You know what they say.

26:53.891 --> 26:55.360
He who is pru...
(beeps)

27:05.114 --> 27:07.017
(snoring nearby)

27:10.424 --> 27:12.428
(snoring continues)

27:19.175 --> 27:20.879
Yep. That's Riggs
in a drawer.

27:20.879 --> 27:22.214
Did you not believe me?

27:22.214 --> 27:23.483
I thought you were trying
to trick me down here

27:23.483 --> 27:24.820
for a birthday party.

27:24.820 --> 27:25.955
Can you both please shut up?

27:25.955 --> 27:27.158
Did you sleep in here?

27:27.158 --> 27:28.293
This is a new low.

27:28.293 --> 27:30.297
So many health
code violations.

27:30.297 --> 27:32.434
AVERY: This is for a college
friend to settle a bet.

27:32.434 --> 27:34.105
What are you do‐‐
shut the drawer.

27:34.105 --> 27:36.042
Murtaugh's looking for you.
He's following Booker.

27:36.042 --> 27:38.213
He may have a lead on the guns.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.921
Oh, that is
not formaldehyde.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.190
Riggs, are you drunk?

27:43.190 --> 27:44.325
Not at the moment.

27:44.325 --> 27:45.460
Should I be worried?

27:48.133 --> 27:49.202
I mean...

27:55.347 --> 27:57.151
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

27:57.151 --> 27:58.821
Excuse me?

27:58.821 --> 28:01.292
You hit Dad's
motorcycle on purpose.

28:01.292 --> 28:03.496
You aimed for it,
maybe even sped up.

28:03.496 --> 28:05.334
What? No.

28:05.334 --> 28:07.037
I‐I didn't see it.
I tried to stop.

28:07.037 --> 28:08.173
Then where are the skid marks?

28:08.173 --> 28:10.845
(scoffs)
Riana, I'm telling you...

28:10.845 --> 28:12.381
No. Let's go out into
the driveway right now.

28:12.381 --> 28:13.951
You can show me

28:13.951 --> 28:16.356
where the skid marks are
from where you braked.

28:16.356 --> 28:18.093
There are no skid marks.

28:18.093 --> 28:20.531
I didn't brake.
I hit it on purpose.
Why?

28:20.531 --> 28:22.501
Because he knows
he's not supposed

28:22.501 --> 28:24.005
to be riding
that motorcycle.

28:24.005 --> 28:26.109
He knows, and he won't
listen to words, so...

28:26.109 --> 28:27.812
Mom. What are
you guys doing?

28:27.812 --> 28:31.019
You guys? No,
not "you guys."

28:31.019 --> 28:32.555
I'm not the one acting‐‐

28:32.555 --> 28:35.494
Listen, I have been
very rational.

28:35.494 --> 28:37.966
Oh, oh, besides the
whole driveway thing.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.368
You know what?
He's the one digging in.

28:39.368 --> 28:41.005
You're both digging in.
Your father started it.

28:41.005 --> 28:42.274
Do you hear
yourself right now?

28:42.274 --> 28:43.511
Listen, you don't understand.

28:43.511 --> 28:44.846
When you're married, you will.

28:44.846 --> 28:46.115
There are lines
that are crossed,

28:46.115 --> 28:48.587
and you just,
you got to dig in.

28:48.587 --> 28:50.057
Fine, Mom.

28:50.057 --> 28:52.394
Even if you're right,

28:52.394 --> 28:55.067
what happens if you guys
dig in so far

28:55.067 --> 28:56.269
that you can't make it back?

28:56.269 --> 28:58.206
(scoffs)

29:15.440 --> 29:17.846
You getting ready to take
those back to the LAPD, right?

29:17.846 --> 29:19.048
What are you doing here, man?

29:19.048 --> 29:20.918
You're gonna mess
this up for me.

29:20.918 --> 29:23.256
Just walk away.
I ain't going nowhere
without you, baby.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.936
Is there a problem, William?

29:29.936 --> 29:33.009
Nah. Ain't no problem
at all, Mr. Strickland.

29:33.009 --> 29:35.080
Yeah, just give us a
second to sort this out.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.284
All I'm saying
is your Glock 19

29:37.284 --> 29:39.623
will take your
Glock 17 magazines,

29:39.623 --> 29:41.593
and not the other way around.
And I think that

29:41.593 --> 29:43.898
that should be
reflected in the price.

29:43.898 --> 29:45.300
STRICKLAND:
William.

29:46.970 --> 29:49.509
You didn't tell me
you'd be bringing someone.

29:49.509 --> 29:52.347
Who's this?

29:52.347 --> 29:54.218
Who am I?

29:54.218 --> 29:57.391
You want to know who I am.

29:57.391 --> 30:00.598
Mr. Strickland, who are you
that you don't know me?

30:03.938 --> 30:05.675
I'm the broker, baby.

30:05.675 --> 30:07.077
I'm the man.

30:07.077 --> 30:09.081
I'm Randy Drexler.

30:09.081 --> 30:11.219
Is that right?

30:13.657 --> 30:15.160
He's with you?

30:19.135 --> 30:20.705
Hell yeah.

30:20.705 --> 30:22.976
It's Randy Drexler.

30:22.976 --> 30:24.513
He's my broker.

30:24.513 --> 30:25.982
I don't leave home
without him.

30:25.982 --> 30:29.388
(laughs)
Fair enough.

30:29.388 --> 30:30.658
(mouths)

30:32.595 --> 30:34.699
(grunts)

30:36.202 --> 30:38.139
That's so next time...

30:38.139 --> 30:41.345
you tell me when
you're bringing someone.

30:41.345 --> 30:44.051
Get your partner here inside,

30:44.051 --> 30:45.555
Randy Drexler.

30:48.226 --> 30:49.428
Let's do some business.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.448
All right, this is a bad idea.
You should wait for backup.

30:59.448 --> 31:02.522
Avery, would you please
take this guy to school?

31:02.522 --> 31:04.091
They don't wait for backup.

31:04.091 --> 31:06.462
We don't know what Strickland
has planned.

31:06.462 --> 31:08.066
This could be an ambush.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.769
Could be, but it's probably not.

31:09.769 --> 31:11.673
Probably not?

31:11.673 --> 31:14.078
You're gonna let him risk
his life on "probably not"?

31:14.078 --> 31:16.015
I don't "let him" do anything.

31:16.015 --> 31:17.552
He just sort of does it.

31:17.552 --> 31:21.158
Yeah. Booker, too.
It's infuriating.

31:21.158 --> 31:24.098
Sometimes I fantasize about
getting hit by a bus.

31:24.098 --> 31:25.433
Not enough to kill me, you know,

31:25.433 --> 31:27.037
just enough to
put me in a coma.

31:27.037 --> 31:28.239
Yeah. For me, it's a train.

31:28.239 --> 31:29.643
A train's interesting.

31:29.643 --> 31:32.281
You‐you know I can
hear you both, right?

31:32.281 --> 31:34.586
What's your plan, Riggs?

31:34.586 --> 31:36.657
You can't just walk up
and knock on the door.

31:36.657 --> 31:39.295
Uh, you're right.

31:39.295 --> 31:41.399
I'll ring the bell.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.436
(doorbell buzzes)

31:43.436 --> 31:46.442
Oh. He's gonna
ring the bell.
It's nicer.

31:46.442 --> 31:49.481
Club's closed.

31:49.481 --> 31:51.352
Oh, I'm not here
for the party.

31:51.352 --> 31:53.456
I have a meeting
with Strickland.

31:53.456 --> 31:55.093
I'm representing
Carlo Gutierrez.

31:55.093 --> 31:56.295
Carlo's dead.

31:56.295 --> 31:57.565
Ah, well.

31:57.565 --> 31:59.501
All the more reason
he needs representation.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.305
Who are you?

32:01.305 --> 32:03.176
Me? I'm, uh...

32:03.176 --> 32:05.548
I'm Randy Drexler.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.384
You're Randy Drexler?

32:07.384 --> 32:08.654
Yeah. Named after my grandpappy

32:08.654 --> 32:10.390
who built the cabin
I grew up in.

32:10.390 --> 32:11.660
Really special man.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.597
Randy Drexler.

32:13.597 --> 32:15.668
Strickland's definitely
gonna want to see you.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.270
Ah, beautiful.

32:18.540 --> 32:21.345
(men speaking softly)

32:21.345 --> 32:22.615
Arms up.

32:29.228 --> 32:30.363
Randy Drexler...

32:32.167 --> 32:33.436
...meet Randy Drexler.

32:33.436 --> 32:34.506
Hey.

32:34.506 --> 32:36.510
Small world.

32:36.510 --> 32:38.045
Microscopic.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.318
What are the odds?

32:41.318 --> 32:44.324
Two Randy Drexlers
in the same club.

32:44.324 --> 32:45.661
Like Drexler and Drexler.

32:45.661 --> 32:47.598
This sounds kind of like
a law firm or something.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.136
Funny. Well, I'm in sales, so...
MURTAUGH: Funny.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.205
You don't look like...

32:51.205 --> 32:52.474
a Randy Drexler.

32:52.474 --> 32:55.915
Funny. That's not
what Denzel said.

32:55.915 --> 32:58.286
I signed an NDA, so I shouldn't
really talk about it,

32:58.286 --> 33:00.490
but he loosely based
one of his characters on me.

33:00.490 --> 33:01.793
Denzel played you in a movie?

33:04.164 --> 33:05.333
I've said too much already.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.370
What do you think,
William?

33:07.370 --> 33:09.509
You vouched for
one Randy.

33:09.509 --> 33:10.578
What about the other?

33:12.582 --> 33:15.119
I ain't never seen that dude
before in my life.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.590
STRICKLAND:
Good.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.594
Then you won't mind
if we kill him.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.800
Look, come on, man.
You ain't got to shoot this guy.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.402
Oh. (laughs)

33:23.402 --> 33:24.806
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

33:24.806 --> 33:26.375
You know, I...
You‐you get me wrong.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.145
I don't care if there's
one Randy Drexler

33:28.145 --> 33:30.618
or two or 12.
I just don't like cops.

33:30.618 --> 33:32.655
Who said anything
about cops, baby?
I did.

33:32.655 --> 33:34.491
Me.

33:34.491 --> 33:36.763
That's who.
And I think you might be one.

33:36.763 --> 33:39.636
Now, I'm more than happy
to be proven wrong.

33:39.636 --> 33:41.773
Go on, take it.

33:44.679 --> 33:45.648
Shoot him.

33:47.317 --> 33:50.958
Hey, look, this... this wasn't
part of the deal, man.

33:50.958 --> 33:53.597
Oh, well, I could kill
all three of you instead.

33:53.597 --> 33:54.966
That's your call.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.736
Or...

33:56.736 --> 33:59.207
we could let him go

33:59.207 --> 34:01.412
and make him live in
the shame of defeat.

34:01.412 --> 34:03.349
Ooh, that
would be cold‐blooded.

34:03.349 --> 34:04.886
You don't
come back from that.

34:04.886 --> 34:06.756
Mm‐mm. You shoot him.

34:06.756 --> 34:08.359
Or he shoots you.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.770
Come on, Randy.

34:13.770 --> 34:16.442
You don't have much of a choice.

34:16.442 --> 34:18.279
It's all right. Shoot me.

34:18.279 --> 34:20.249
You want me to shoot you?

34:20.249 --> 34:21.686
Yeah.

34:21.686 --> 34:23.857
I want you to shoot me.

34:23.857 --> 34:26.395
Just‐just shoot me.
This is...

34:26.395 --> 34:27.698
Randy, it's okay.

34:27.698 --> 34:29.669
Some people...

34:29.669 --> 34:31.539
they're beyond saving.

34:31.539 --> 34:33.677
Let's go.
It's now or never.

34:33.677 --> 34:34.979
Let's go, Randy!

34:34.979 --> 34:36.683
Shoot!
On three.
Three...

34:36.683 --> 34:38.419
two...
Shoot, Randy!

34:38.419 --> 34:39.856
Shoot!
Do it!
(gun clicks)

34:40.824 --> 34:42.360
What?

34:42.360 --> 34:43.830
(laughs)

34:43.830 --> 34:45.433
You thought we'd give
you a loaded gun?

34:47.370 --> 34:48.874
But you did good, Randy.

34:48.874 --> 34:50.376
You did real good.

34:50.376 --> 34:53.182
Now take him out back
and do it right.

35:11.553 --> 35:12.621
You shot at me!

35:12.621 --> 35:13.990
You told me to shoot you!

35:13.990 --> 35:15.627
You were supposed
to shoot over me.

35:15.627 --> 35:16.696
Or shoot the bad
guy, something!

35:16.696 --> 35:18.165
How was I supposed to know that?

35:20.971 --> 35:23.309
Listen, I was very clear
with my signal!

35:23.309 --> 35:25.446
MURTAUGH:
You suck at charades.

35:25.446 --> 35:27.852
Besides, I knew it wasn't loaded

35:27.852 --> 35:29.387
'cause I could feel
the weight of the gun.

35:29.387 --> 35:30.991
Lies.

35:30.991 --> 35:32.528
How? What‐what lies?

35:32.528 --> 35:34.397
A bullet weighs ten grams.

35:34.397 --> 35:35.901
I'm an industry professional.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.337
I know my tools.

35:37.337 --> 35:38.740
(gunfire continues)

35:41.646 --> 35:43.750
(grunts)

35:43.750 --> 35:46.355
Hey, speaking of tools,
mine's empty.

35:47.625 --> 35:48.894
Yeah. Me, too.

35:50.296 --> 35:52.033
Hey, Randy?

35:52.033 --> 35:53.503
Yeah?

35:55.439 --> 35:56.676
Been nice working with you.

35:58.814 --> 36:00.717
You, too, Randy.

36:05.326 --> 36:06.663
(door opens)
LAPD! Hands in the air!

36:06.663 --> 36:08.667
On your knees!
Hands in the air!

36:08.667 --> 36:09.735
Put your weapons down now!

36:09.735 --> 36:11.673
Stay on the ground!

36:11.673 --> 36:12.942
Hey, Cap.

36:14.745 --> 36:16.215
What took you guys so long?

36:17.818 --> 36:19.354
You're right.

36:20.824 --> 36:22.293
Train's faster.

36:28.439 --> 36:30.042
You're serious?
Rog, I am just dying

36:30.042 --> 36:31.646
to see this magical
skill of yours.

36:31.646 --> 36:33.583
So you choose the weapon
that's unloaded,

36:33.583 --> 36:34.886
and I'll shoot myself
in the foot.

36:34.886 --> 36:36.321
I don't want to.

36:36.321 --> 36:37.591
Because you can't. Admit it.
I can.

36:37.591 --> 36:38.860
You got lucky.
Uh, hey.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.329
How's your shoulder?
(clears throat)

36:40.329 --> 36:42.467
It's about as good
as this coffee.
Mm.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.770
(chuckles) Hey, listen, man,

36:43.770 --> 36:45.473
I need to apologize
for the other day.

36:45.473 --> 36:47.878
The elevator.
Hey, forget it.

36:47.878 --> 36:49.749
Undercover life, right?

36:49.749 --> 36:51.351
Every day's an adventure.

36:51.351 --> 36:54.659
Yeah, well, you saved my ass,
Randy Drexler.

36:54.659 --> 36:55.894
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

36:55.894 --> 36:57.030
What?

36:57.030 --> 36:58.566
This gun. That's the one.

36:58.566 --> 36:59.769
Oh, is this it?
Yep.

36:59.769 --> 37:01.371
You know,
it doesn't feel like it.

37:01.371 --> 37:02.373
Yeah, trust me.
All right, I'm gonna shoot.

37:02.373 --> 37:04.612
One, two, three!
Ah!

37:05.981 --> 37:07.584
You're right.

37:07.584 --> 37:09.487
Your lunatic's worse.
Thank you.

37:09.487 --> 37:11.793
Let's go.

37:11.793 --> 37:12.995
What was that?

37:12.995 --> 37:15.499
Rog has a special skill.

37:15.499 --> 37:18.673
He can determine
if a weapon is loaded or not

37:18.673 --> 37:19.875
simply by putting it
in his hands.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.679
Yeah, my hands
are like scales.

37:21.679 --> 37:23.883
Really? Can they also
deliver wine, flowers...
Mm‐hmm.

37:23.883 --> 37:25.654
...and a romantic
apology weekend for your wife?

37:25.654 --> 37:27.357
I don't need an apology weekend.

37:27.357 --> 37:28.893
Oh, you and Trish made up?

37:28.893 --> 37:30.964
Even better. She screwed up.

37:30.964 --> 37:32.500
(laughs)

37:32.500 --> 37:34.772
She ran my motorcycle
over on purpose,

37:34.772 --> 37:35.941
but now she
feels really bad.

37:35.941 --> 37:37.410
She's called me
twice already.

37:37.410 --> 37:38.913
Solved like adults.
What did she say?

37:38.913 --> 37:40.517
I didn't even pick up the phone.

37:40.517 --> 37:41.719
(Riggs and Avery groan)
I'm milking it.

37:41.719 --> 37:43.088
For the first time,
I have

37:43.088 --> 37:45.594
the upper hand
in the relationship.

37:45.594 --> 37:46.729
You don't have the‐‐
you've got pocket threes, Rog.

37:46.729 --> 37:48.666
At best. You should fold.
Yeah.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.871
You should fold. Fold.
It's like Sun Tzu
says. If you...

37:56.983 --> 37:58.720
What he said.

38:01.959 --> 38:04.497
(seabirds squawking)

38:10.544 --> 38:12.514
(exhales)

38:32.888 --> 38:35.594
I see you took care
of your boot problem.

38:35.594 --> 38:37.598
Well, a couple of shotgun shells

38:37.598 --> 38:38.967
will pretty much
take care of anything.

38:38.967 --> 38:41.104
Let me guess.
Charles Bronson taught you that?

38:41.104 --> 38:42.508
Ricardo Montalbán's stableboy.

38:42.508 --> 38:43.877
(clicks tongue)

38:43.877 --> 38:46.047
So, uh...

38:46.047 --> 38:47.851
what are you still
doing hanging around?

38:47.851 --> 38:49.989
Well, you know,
wanted to say good‐bye.

38:49.989 --> 38:52.126
And, uh...

38:52.126 --> 38:56.168
you know, something maybe
in the apology arena.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.606
("The Weight" by The Band
playing)

38:58.606 --> 39:00.476
Uh...

39:00.476 --> 39:02.480
you didn't come home last night.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.820
Thinking I was maybe
a little too harsh.

39:05.820 --> 39:07.456
♪ I pulled into Nazareth ♪

39:07.456 --> 39:09.695
♪ Was feeling
about half past dead ♪

39:13.435 --> 39:16.141
Maybe you could change
your mind.

39:17.578 --> 39:19.582
Stick around for a little while.

39:19.582 --> 39:20.984
Wish I could.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.488
(sighs) I'm not built
to stick around.

39:23.488 --> 39:24.892
Not like you.

39:24.892 --> 39:27.129
I never did figure out
how to put down roots.

39:27.129 --> 39:28.465
Roots? Lady,

39:28.465 --> 39:30.637
my house has wheels on it, too.

39:30.637 --> 39:33.041
Wheel. One wheel.

39:33.041 --> 39:34.912
Yeah, the left one
had some life in it,

39:34.912 --> 39:36.616
so I took it
in case I need a spare.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.939
And I was thinking...

41:11.939 --> 41:14.043
About running over
my motorcycle.

41:14.043 --> 41:15.880
Don't even worry about it.

41:15.880 --> 41:17.016
You're forgiven.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.318
I'm forgiven?
Mm‐hmm.

41:18.318 --> 41:20.222
I did park haphazardly

41:20.222 --> 41:22.059
in the middle of the driveway.
That's true.

41:22.059 --> 41:24.230
Mm‐hmm. And it was dark out,

41:24.230 --> 41:26.034
so you probably didn't see it.
It was dark.

41:26.034 --> 41:27.971

the first time

41:38.091 --> 41:40.830
that I ran over your motorcycle.

And I'm sorry
that I said that I'm over it,

41:43.836 --> 41:46.007
and I really wasn't over it.

41:46.007 --> 41:49.247
And I'm still not over it,
but I'm getting over it.

41:49.247 --> 41:52.086

41:52.086 --> 41:54.223

Mm‐hmm.

No, outside.

Well, actually,

you know? (chuckles)

42:20.342 --> 42:21.946

42:21.946 --> 42:24.016

42:24.016 --> 42:26.387

made a mistake,

42:30.997 --> 42:32.867

"Mistake"?

was a mistake.
