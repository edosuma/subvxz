00:01.697 --> 00:02.567
<i>Previously on</i> Alaska Daily...

00:02.567 --> 00:04.047
Ezra Fisher?

00:04.047 --> 00:05.266
Can I speak with you?

00:05.266 --> 00:06.397
What's this about?

00:06.397 --> 00:07.529
Gloria Nanmac.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.574
- Yeah? I remember Gloria.
- You knew her?

00:09.574 --> 00:11.141
Last place she was known
to be alive

00:11.141 --> 00:13.361
was at a house belonging
to Clarence Redding.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.145
Skeeter. Yeah. I know him.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.712
If you were looking for drugs

00:16.712 --> 00:18.801
or just about anything else,
you'd go to Skeeter's.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.238
How did your custody
mediation thing go this morning?

00:21.238 --> 00:23.153
- Kinda intense.
- You deserve better.

00:24.589 --> 00:25.851
Do I?

00:25.851 --> 00:27.723
Because I don't think--
I don't-- It doesn't--

00:28.898 --> 00:30.508
Good morning, Mr. Crenshaw.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.815
You're being charged with
murder in the first degree

00:32.815 --> 00:35.296
in the death of Gloria Nanmac.
How do you plead?

00:35.296 --> 00:36.688
Not guilty, Your Honor.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.690
Look, Toby's case isn't unusual.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.562
The cops get a young guy
in the box without a lawyer,

00:40.562 --> 00:42.564
he's pressured into confessing
and signing a statement.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.826
Does that mean
you're gonna take the job

00:43.826 --> 00:45.175
at <i>The New York Times?</i>

00:45.175 --> 00:46.698
If I'm being honest,
I haven't decided.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.135
Your turn. Getting an offer

00:48.135 --> 00:50.572
from <i>The Washington Post</i>
ain't no small feat.

00:50.572 --> 00:53.879
I always thought I'd jump at it,
but now... I don't know.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.534
Special delivery. The records
for Gloria's burner phone.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.841
Look at the date
of the last call she made.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.538
To 911.

01:00.538 --> 01:01.713
There has to be a recording.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.411
And we gotta hear it.

01:08.285 --> 01:11.158
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:11.158 --> 01:13.421
<i>Help.</i>

01:13.421 --> 01:14.726
<i>Please help.</i>

01:14.726 --> 01:17.294
<i>Ma'am, I can't hear you.</i>

01:17.294 --> 01:19.557
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

01:19.557 --> 01:21.298
<i>Can you tell me your name?</i>

01:21.298 --> 01:24.432
<i>Gloria. My name is Gloria.</i>

01:24.432 --> 01:25.737
<i>Where are you, Gloria?</i>

01:25.737 --> 01:27.435
<i>Are you alone?</i>

01:27.435 --> 01:29.567
<i>GLORIA [distorted]:
I don't know.</i>

01:29.567 --> 01:31.569
<i>Ezra, please...</i>

01:32.570 --> 01:34.442
She said "Ezra."

01:34.442 --> 01:35.834
You're sure this date
is correct?

01:35.834 --> 01:38.446
Yeah, if that's what it says,
that's what it is.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.231
That was more than 24 hours
after she was reported missing.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.190
How could she have survived
out on the tundra

01:43.190 --> 01:44.495
with all those injuries?

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323
Maybe that old boat
where they found her,

01:46.323 --> 01:47.890
maybe she used it for shelter.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.457
Why didn't anyone look for her?

01:49.457 --> 01:51.198
We never got her location.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.678
You're 911. Isn't it your job
to figure it out?

01:54.810 --> 01:56.768
This call came
from Meade, right?

01:56.768 --> 01:58.466
That's 500 miles from here,

01:58.466 --> 02:01.512
and we cover five times
that square mileage every day.

02:01.991 --> 02:05.255
Over that distance, the call
gets relayed so many times,

02:05.255 --> 02:07.475
we lose the location data.

02:07.475 --> 02:10.478
Didn't the previous governor
have a plan to fix that?

02:10.478 --> 02:12.175
Yeah, that's been
the promise for years,

02:12.175 --> 02:14.438
but getting a promise
from the governor

02:14.438 --> 02:17.528
and funds from the state
are two very different things.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.488
Cops in Meade never heard
this recording, did they?

02:20.488 --> 02:22.925
I can almost guarantee it.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.943
She said "Ezra." No question.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.684
But with no context.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.425
But we do know
he left the party with her.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.035
He was the last one
to see her alive.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.733
Well, still, the recording
doesn't link him to her murder.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.345
So what do we do?

02:51.997 --> 02:53.260
We should report on this,

02:53.260 --> 02:54.609
see if it shakes
something loose.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.654
We'll say that
newly released 911 records

02:56.654 --> 02:57.960
reveal that Gloria was alive

02:57.960 --> 02:59.962
for more than a day
after she went missing.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.833
The lack of spending
on the village infrastructure

03:01.833 --> 03:03.879
is the reason why she
couldn't reach the Meade cops.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.404
If she had, they could have
saved her life.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.538
Do we drop Ezra's name?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.409
Yeah. We'll print
the recordings.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.976
Public record.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.238
Wish we had more.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.848
I asked Gabriel to call
the other numbers

03:16.848 --> 03:18.023
on Gloria's phone.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.851
We'll see if that
gives us something.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.593
It better.
Toby's hearing is in two days.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.858
Hey. Did you get that list
of family law firms I sent you?

03:26.858 --> 03:28.425
I did, thanks.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.906
I got a meeting on the books
with Lisa Battle,

03:30.906 --> 03:32.299
mostly 'cause I liked the name.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.998
Hey, um,

03:35.998 --> 03:39.871
I got a call from Marcilena
from <i>The Wasilla Gazette.</i>

03:39.871 --> 03:41.003
- You know her?
- Yeah, I do.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.874
Marci's cool. Good reporter.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.006
- What does she want?
- To meet.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.442
Sounded urgent.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.704
More layoffs.

03:46.704 --> 03:47.879
Ah, could be, yeah.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.316
Hey, you want me
to pick you something up?

03:49.316 --> 03:51.318
No, it's okay.
I brought my own lunch.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.015
Oh. Brown bagging it.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.451
Respect.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.887
All right, see you in a bit.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.631
It's happening, isn't it?

04:01.545 --> 04:02.807
Totally happening.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.592
I knew it was happening.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.463
I'm kvelling.

04:06.463 --> 04:07.508
Wait, hold on. How do we kvell?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.944
Wait, what's kvell?

04:08.944 --> 04:11.033
You kvell when something
makes you proud and happy.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.600
- It's from Yiddish.
- Oh, yeah.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.079
I'm not sure if we can say that
without being Jewish.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.733
I'm pretty sure
anyone can kvell.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.780
I don't know.
I dated this guy from Iceland.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.826
He was nearly destroyed
for saying he wanted a siesta.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.915
He was always tired.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.352
So I can't kvell anymore?

04:25.352 --> 04:26.614
Why can't you kvell?

04:26.614 --> 04:27.963
Apparently because
I'm not Jewish.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.747
Oh, you can kvell all you want.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.358
What are you kvelling about?

04:31.358 --> 04:32.750
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.057
Oh, well, carry on kvelling.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.406
Just no kvetching.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.755
But not because
it's appropriating.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.366
I just don't like complainers.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.628
Copy that.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.370
Yuna, have you filed
the school voucher story?

04:43.370 --> 04:45.807
I did. Just waiting on
some fact-checking questions.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.635
Okay, but you're late, right?

04:49.027 --> 04:51.421
- Right.
- When in doubt, leave it out.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.683
Get the damn story in.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.644
That's not about you.

05:10.658 --> 05:11.659
How you doing, Bob?

05:12.137 --> 05:13.356
I'm okay. Why?

05:13.356 --> 05:14.879
Just checking in.

05:14.879 --> 05:18.013
If this is about Yuna,
she needs to respect deadlines.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.928
This isn't the first time
she's blown through one.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.800
Okay, but we all miss deadlines.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.367
Maybe we shouldn't.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.804
Maybe this place would be
in better shape if we didn't.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.023
Just 'cause
the world's falling apart

05:28.023 --> 05:29.459
doesn't mean
we don't have a job to do.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.462
Is it? Falling apart?

05:33.681 --> 05:35.857
I have to take this.
If you'll excuse me.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.555
Sure.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.863
But if you need...
anything, just ask.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.877
I appreciate you meeting me
on such short notice.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.618
Yeah, what's going on?

05:57.618 --> 06:01.143
You think you can put in a word
at <i>The Daily Alaskan?</i>

06:01.143 --> 06:02.405
I need a job.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.625
You know, I gotta be honest,

06:04.625 --> 06:08.019
it's pretty tight
at the <i>Alaskan</i> right now.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.369
I thought you guys
were doing okay.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.459
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but, um,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.199
half the newsroom
got axed this morning.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.723
My God.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.594
Yeah, I mean, nobody was
getting rich or anything,

06:17.594 --> 06:20.205
but they gathered us together
this morning

06:20.205 --> 06:22.599
and told us
the paper's been sold.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.166
- To who?
- They wouldn't say.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.473
Just, "We're sold."

06:26.473 --> 06:28.213
Then they pulled half of us
into the conference room

06:28.213 --> 06:30.172
to tell us-- as a group--

06:30.172 --> 06:33.480
we were being laid off,
effective immediately.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.177
- Classy.
- Yeah.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.614
Uh, was it Horizon Capital,
by chance?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.181
They tried to buy us.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.878
You know, I--

06:40.878 --> 06:43.185
I don't know. Um, listen,

06:43.185 --> 06:47.189
I don't mean to be pushy,
but could you ask today?

06:47.189 --> 06:50.061
I mean, I've got a kid
and a mortgage,

06:50.061 --> 06:53.630
and... I'm worried.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.676
I'll ask as soon as I'm back.
I promise.

06:57.939 --> 06:58.940
And, Marci,

07:00.594 --> 07:02.073
I'm sorry.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.553
Thanks.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.859
That's good.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.644
Uh, lose that, I think.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.080
Yeah.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.734
Good. Done.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.083
Great. Send it to Stanley.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.563
Tell him to give us
a strong headline.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.912
We need to grab eyes.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.785
Like 911 is broke as hell
and killing people?

07:17.785 --> 07:19.134
Something like that.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.659
Hey, I think I got a hit
on those phone numbers

07:22.659 --> 07:24.531
you asked me to check
from Gloria's phone.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.229
- Yeah?
- Yeah, so most of them
are names you've reported on--

07:27.229 --> 07:29.971
Alice, Toby Crenshaw, Gallahorn,

07:29.971 --> 07:34.541
but this number is
for a Clarence Redding.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.542
I didn't know that name.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.717
Holy crap.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.545
- Holy crap good?
- Holy crap very good.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.589
We know Clarence Redding.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.895
Yeah, we do.

07:40.895 --> 07:41.983
We call him Skeeter.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.125
<i>Hello?</i>

07:54.125 --> 07:56.127
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.739
Uh, I thought this was
Skeeter's number?

07:58.739 --> 08:01.698
<i>This is his old number.
Who's this?</i>

08:01.698 --> 08:03.613
Uh, my name is Roz Friendly.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.615
This is the only number I had.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.618
I live in Anchorage,
and I thought

08:08.618 --> 08:10.838
that I saw him
on the street the other day.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.709
<i>Yeah, he lives there now.</i>

08:12.709 --> 08:14.276
<i>Well, in Palmer.</i>

08:14.276 --> 08:15.712
<i>You from Meade?</i>

08:15.712 --> 08:17.845
No. Um, Southeast.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.150
Is this his sister?

08:19.150 --> 08:20.630
<i>His niece.</i>

08:20.630 --> 08:21.849
<i>Sarah.</i>

08:21.849 --> 08:23.154
Hey, Sarah.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.286
Do you have his new number?

08:24.286 --> 08:25.592
I'd love to reach out.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.637
<i>I would, but Skeeter told me</i>

08:27.637 --> 08:29.160
<i>not to pass on his new number</i>

08:29.160 --> 08:31.162
<i>when he gave me his phone.</i>

08:31.162 --> 08:32.729
I get that. Sure.

08:32.729 --> 08:36.733
Well, if you talk to him,
let him know Roz said hi.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.648
It was really nice to see him,

08:38.648 --> 08:41.738
and, uh, you have my number
if you'd like to give it to him.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.000
<i>Okay.</i>

08:44.785 --> 08:46.613
Bye, Sarah. Have a great day.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.918
<i>You, too.</i>

08:49.833 --> 08:51.356
Should I have told her
I was a reporter?

08:51.356 --> 08:53.750
Mm, wouldn't have helped.
You played it well.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.064
It's her.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.066
"You sounded nice."

09:06.589 --> 09:08.635
We have his number
and his address.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.333
Like I said, you played it well.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.900
Let's go to Palmer.

09:37.838 --> 09:38.839
Can I help you?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.231
Hi, there.
Uh, Roz Friendly,

09:40.231 --> 09:43.104
Eileen Fitzgerald
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

09:43.104 --> 09:45.019
Are you Skeeter?

09:45.019 --> 09:46.847
I go by Clarence now.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.286
We can talk outside.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.249
We were hoping to talk to you
about a woman

09:58.249 --> 10:01.078
we're reporting on,
Gloria Nanmac.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.297
Do you remember her?

10:04.038 --> 10:05.648
Yeah. I do.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.084
Several people we talked to
placed her

10:07.084 --> 10:08.259
at your house
the night she went missing.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.652
Is that true?

10:10.827 --> 10:13.090
Why are you asking
about Gloria?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.962
Thought they got Toby Crenshaw
for her murder.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.311
Isn't that all over?

10:16.311 --> 10:18.269
We're just filling out
a timeline for a story.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.837
Just tying up
loose ends.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.971
Yeah.
She came by that night.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.320
Bunch of other people, too.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.627
Including Ezra Fisher?

10:29.803 --> 10:31.282
Yeah, he was there.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.110
Was his son, Jackson,
there, too?

10:35.722 --> 10:36.940
Yeah.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.336
Ezra told us that he left
your house that night

10:41.336 --> 10:44.295
to get Jackson
and never came back.

10:44.295 --> 10:47.124
Why would he lie
about that?

10:47.124 --> 10:49.866
Yeah, um,
I don't know.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.781
It was a long time ago.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.478
Hard to remember everything,
you know?

10:53.478 --> 10:55.089
Do you remember
what happened to your home?

10:55.089 --> 10:56.177
'Cause we couldn't find it.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.702
I sold it
to my buddy's brother.

10:59.702 --> 11:02.139
He put it on a sled
and moved it down to Nasiq,

11:02.139 --> 11:03.880
next village over.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.968
Why did you leave Meade
so quickly

11:04.968 --> 11:06.187
after Gloria disappeared?

11:08.058 --> 11:09.799
Nancy got pregnant.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.671
She wanted to leave,
so we did.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.369
Look, I...

11:17.198 --> 11:19.243
They changed my life.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.071
I'm not that guy anymore.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.727
I believe that.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.251
But Toby Crenshaw is about
to go to prison for a long time,

11:27.251 --> 11:30.472
and we both know
he didn't kill Gloria.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.213
Are you okay with that?

11:34.432 --> 11:36.347
Uh, I just...

11:36.347 --> 11:38.741
I'm done
talking about this.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.264
Just leave me alone.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.184
He knows more than
he's telling us.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.751
Yeah.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.231
- So we come back?
- We have to.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.930
Excuse me.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.933
Are you the ones that wrote
that article today?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.369
About the 911 recordings?

11:58.369 --> 12:00.807
Yeah. We did.

12:08.771 --> 12:09.990
Just tell them, Clarence.

12:13.384 --> 12:16.518
Look, you got a-a good life
here, Clarence.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.999
I understand why you left
your crowd back in Meade,

12:18.999 --> 12:21.958
but, you know,
if you know anything

12:21.958 --> 12:24.744
about what happened to Gloria,
you're gonna screw all this up.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.051
Just tell them.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.270
Just tell us what?

12:31.011 --> 12:33.056
She said Ezra's name
in the 911 recording.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.405
They're going to get him.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.580
Stop it.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.974
I'm no lawyer,
but if you know something

12:37.974 --> 12:40.411
and you come clean, there's
always a deal to be made.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.022
I don't need a deal.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.197
You sure about that?

12:43.197 --> 12:44.589
You could go to the DA,

12:44.589 --> 12:47.070
ask for immunity in exchange
for your testimony.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.986
But if Ezra talks first
and throws you under the bus,

12:49.986 --> 12:52.119
it's gonna be bad.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.598
Tell them.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.166
You shouldn't have to keep
his secrets anymore.

13:01.432 --> 13:05.436
Ezra left his kid in my bedroom

13:05.436 --> 13:09.310
when he took off with Gloria,
and she was pretty out of it.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.833
Where did they go?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.008
I don't know.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.575
He said he was just
dropping her home,

13:13.575 --> 13:15.446
but he didn't come back
for hours,

13:15.446 --> 13:18.188
and when he did, he told me
to start a burn barrel.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.887
What did he want to burn?

13:20.887 --> 13:24.891
A bag of clothes,
uh, his clothes.

13:24.891 --> 13:28.024
Was he wearing different clothes
when he came back to your house?

13:28.024 --> 13:30.461
He changed. Yeah.

13:30.461 --> 13:34.509
He told me that he'd kill me
if I told anyone.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.469
And then he left
with Jackson.

13:38.469 --> 13:42.212
So you burned his stuff
and went to bed?

13:43.213 --> 13:44.432
Yeah.

13:45.694 --> 13:48.218
But, um...

13:48.218 --> 13:50.917
not everything burned.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.309
What didn't burn?

13:52.309 --> 13:55.356
I figured I needed
some kind of security.

13:56.444 --> 13:59.316
So I hid them in the house.

13:59.316 --> 14:02.189
In the house we couldn't find?

14:02.189 --> 14:04.191
What didn't burn, Clarence?

14:34.090 --> 14:35.352
I'll be blunt.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.528
You're screwing me here.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.575
Getting things to you that early
is deeply problematic.

14:40.575 --> 14:43.534
- Stanley, I realize--
- To state the obvious,

14:43.534 --> 14:46.363
we're the biggest
printing job in Anchorage.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.669
So, why is this happening?

14:47.669 --> 14:50.106
There's a new player
in town.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.108
They have lots of money
and lots of demands.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.110
- Who is this new player?
- I can't say.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.243
Not until the deal
is closed.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.331
I'm sorry, Stanley.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.593
You've always been
a good partner,

14:58.593 --> 15:00.551
but it's just
too much money.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.423
Hmm.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.382
Who's taking our 9:00 p.m.?

15:05.382 --> 15:06.949
I'm trying to find out.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.039
A 7:00 p.m. print deadline means
we have to file at 3:00 p.m.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.606
We won't be able to report
half the day's news.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.564
Yeah. We'll be in trouble.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.088
I mean, why would they...

15:15.088 --> 15:17.133
We've been the only daily paper
in this town since--

15:17.133 --> 15:19.005
Since the last daily paper
went out of business?

15:19.005 --> 15:21.398
- Is there a new daily paper?
- Apparently.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.618
They're gonna try and poach
our public notices and inserts.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.316
Not to mention,
if they do have deep pockets,

15:26.316 --> 15:29.015
they can subsidize their losses
and bleed us dry.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.581
I just saw Marci
from <i>The Wasilla Gazette.</i>

15:30.581 --> 15:32.018
She said they got bought.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.454
- By who?
- She didn't know.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.369
Circle back with her.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.197
See if she knows
anything else.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.328
Will do.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.590
There was a group
out of Juneau

15:39.590 --> 15:41.418
sniffing around the paper
a few years ago,

15:41.418 --> 15:43.594
funded by that guy who owns
the Heavy Equipment chain.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.162
Yeah.
Uh, Victor Bernard?

15:46.162 --> 15:47.511
Yeah. That's him.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.426
Bernard.
Bad dude.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.298
- Yuna, look into it.
- Okay.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.603
I've known Frank Lester
for years.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.083
- I'll give him a call.
- Who's that?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.302
Editor of the <i>Gazette.</i>

15:55.302 --> 15:57.043
- I'll put out some feelers too.
- Okay.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.088
- Let me know if I can help.
- Yeah.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.460
You seeing this, ladies?

16:23.460 --> 16:24.679
We're seeing it.

16:26.507 --> 16:27.899
<i>McKENNA: Two crutches.</i>

16:27.899 --> 16:30.206
<i>I'll hand them off
to Trooper Wilson.</i>

16:30.206 --> 16:31.512
<i>He'll keep
chain of custody intact,</i>

16:31.512 --> 16:33.079
<i>bring them to Anchorage.</i>

16:33.079 --> 16:34.123
<i>Quyanaq,</i> Chief.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.820
Absolutely. <i>Quyanaq.</i>

16:35.820 --> 16:38.562
<i>Glad I could be of help.</i>

16:38.562 --> 16:40.477
The proverbial smoking crutches.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.652
Right.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.393
Skeeter was on the record, right?

16:43.393 --> 16:44.873
He was.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.570
How long before Toby Crenshaw's
plea change hearing?

16:46.570 --> 16:47.919
36 hours.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.486
We need to publish again,
try and move the needle.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.227
- Definitely.
- Okay, what do we have?

16:51.227 --> 16:54.535
We have Clarence saying
that Ezra left with Gloria

16:54.535 --> 16:56.798
and returned hours later
with her crutches

16:56.798 --> 16:58.321
and wearing different clothes.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.888
After Ezra threatened him,

16:59.888 --> 17:02.064
Clarence burned the clothes
that Ezra was wearing that night

17:02.064 --> 17:04.110
and hid Gloria's crutches
in the wall of his house.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.459
It's him, Stanley.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.808
Ezra killed Gloria.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.506
He did. We got him.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.117
Write it up.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.165
Thanks, Frank.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.080
And thanks for calling me back.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.343
I know it's a tough time.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.389
The <i>Gazette</i> deserves better.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.173
You deserve better.

17:25.522 --> 17:26.741
Take care.

17:33.574 --> 17:34.749
Hey.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.490
Did you follow up with Marci?

17:36.490 --> 17:38.274
I did.
She didn't know anything else.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.754
- Mm.
- Said the vibe's really weird.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.364
A lot of rumors swirling.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.539
Nothing about Victor Bernard?

17:42.539 --> 17:44.193
No.
Well, at least not yet.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.847
I did a deeper dive on him.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.544
He's scary.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.851
He got indicted twice
on racketeering charges.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.114
Yep. That's who we want running
a daily newspaper.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.160
I just heard Victor's in D.C.
right now.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.857
I wonder if that has something
to do with the sale.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.903
- Mm.
- Well, if it's Victor,
he's got big plans.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.601
I just got off the phone
with Frank Lester.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.342
And?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.866
Not only is the new owner
rebranding the <i>Gazette,</i>

18:04.866 --> 18:06.172
they're expanding.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.869
Wait, so they're
laying people off,

18:07.869 --> 18:09.175
but they're expanding?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.219
With who?

18:10.219 --> 18:11.655
Frank didn't know.

18:11.655 --> 18:15.181
How does the editor not know
who's buying them?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.486
Because he was fired.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.314
He got canned, too?

18:18.314 --> 18:20.534
- Who replaced him? Does he know?
- Oh, he knows.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.581
Dennis Gibson is replacing him.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.192
Dennis Gibson?!

18:26.192 --> 18:28.324
He's a blogger, not an editor.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.326
And he hates us.
All he does is attack us.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.459
Well, he's about to have
a much larger platform

18:32.459 --> 18:34.417
from which to do so.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.295
So... Ezra did it?

18:43.470 --> 18:45.167
We think so.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.908
Yes.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.476
So can I go?

18:49.476 --> 18:52.218
No, Toby, you-- you can't go.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.264
But I'm not gonna have to change
my plea to guilty, right?

18:55.264 --> 18:57.788
This guy Ezra did it.
They're gonna let me out.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.790
You're sure as hell
not gonna plead guilty,

18:59.790 --> 19:03.620
but whatever happens
is gonna take a minute.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.361
I don't understand.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.930
The DA has to be willing to act
on Clarence Redding's statement

19:08.930 --> 19:10.845
and the evidence found
in his house.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.368
We need the DA to believe

19:12.368 --> 19:14.240
that he can build
a winnable case against Ezra.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.373
- But...
- You signed a confession.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.679
That's a cakewalk for them.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.510
The DA is lazy.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.512
We have to make it easy
for them.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.948
But here's the good news.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.819
Our reporter friends here
have dug up

19:28.819 --> 19:31.213
a lot of reasonable doubt.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.607
So if they don't charge
Ezra Fisher and exonerate you,

19:33.607 --> 19:35.652
we'll have to go to trial,
but now,

19:35.652 --> 19:38.525
we have a pretty good chance
of getting an acquittal.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.179
A good chance?

19:41.354 --> 19:42.529
But what about bail?

19:42.529 --> 19:44.487
I can't stay
in here anymore.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.662
Can you get me out
on bail?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.229
Not without a hearing.
But I...

19:47.229 --> 19:48.839
Look, I can file for one.
It's just...

19:48.839 --> 19:50.406
It's gonna take a minute.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.979
The Eagle has totally
revamped their site.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.415
None of those small,
niche ads

19:59.415 --> 20:01.417
for apocalypse supplies
or whatever.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.332
Some major legit
advertisers now.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.420
It has begun.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.335
- The rise of Dennis Gibson.
- Hmm.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.989
No wonder he's been
dodging my calls.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.252
He's too big for us now.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.906
How did you find out
where he lives?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.603
We do book club
at his house.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.913
Roz.
Uh, she had it.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.568
Paid him a visit while Eileen
and Gabriel were held hostage.

20:21.568 --> 20:22.917
Mm.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.527
And here we are.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.016
And there goes Dennis.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.019
On it.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.392
What's he doing?

21:03.392 --> 21:05.351
Yeah, why's he doing it here?

21:05.351 --> 21:08.484
These are the old
Harlan Oil offices.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.356
Yeah.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.358
Do you want
to approach him?

21:12.358 --> 21:14.098
Let's give it a minute.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.535
Curious.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.496
Your story's number three
and climbing.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.063
People are reading it.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.543
Let's hope the DA has.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.848
Did you e-mail him?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.415
And everyone else
in his office.

21:26.415 --> 21:30.071
Hey, there are people gathering
outside the DA's office.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.942
- Demonstration?
- Looks that way.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.683
I'm heading that direction.
I'll take a look.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.772
Maybe I'll give him a call,
see if he wants to comment

21:35.772 --> 21:37.513
- on the growing foot traffic.
- Good idea.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.080
Anything to keep
the pressure on.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.603
We gotta flush him out.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.996
DA just announced
a press conference.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.433
Consider him flushed.

21:46.522 --> 21:47.958
The State of Alaska

21:47.958 --> 21:49.960
has decided to drop
the charges

21:49.960 --> 21:51.701
of murder
in the first degree,

21:51.701 --> 21:53.529
sexual assault
in the first degree,

21:53.529 --> 21:56.663
and aggravated assault
against Toby Crenshaw.

21:58.142 --> 22:01.842
Ezra Fisher of Anchorage
was arrested a few minutes ago

22:01.842 --> 22:05.149
for the murder
of Gloria Nanmac.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.588
Now, Governor Thacker would like
to make a brief statement.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.635
Good afternoon.

22:12.635 --> 22:17.118
I can say with certainty that
Alaska is safer for all women

22:17.118 --> 22:19.773
since the arrest
of Ezra Fisher.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.471
The system may be imperfect,
but today, it worked.

22:22.471 --> 22:26.040
To see it continue working,
the Department of Public Safety

22:26.040 --> 22:29.522
will be put under review,
and adjustments will be made.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.439
But I want to make one thing
very clear...

22:33.439 --> 22:34.918
Thacker found
his scapegoat.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.485
...that
suggestions from the media

22:36.485 --> 22:39.009
over the past few months
that the State of Alaska

22:39.009 --> 22:42.012
is somehow responsible
for the death of Gloria Nanmac

22:42.012 --> 22:44.711
are both false
and offensive.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.756
It's fake news, folks.

22:46.756 --> 22:50.151
The truth is, Ezra Fisher
and Ezra Fisher alone

22:50.151 --> 22:53.937
killed Gloria,
and for that, he will pay.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.852
No questions at this point.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.027
Governor!

22:57.027 --> 22:59.029
This guy.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.466
- Yeah.
- Let's file this.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.435
I like stakeouts
with you.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.092
Do we have
to tell Stanley?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.878
You mean
that we're involved?

23:21.878 --> 23:23.880
There are rules
about this stuff.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.883
I mean, are we supposed
to inform HR?

23:26.883 --> 23:28.929
That's only if there's
a power differential.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.496
Is there?

23:30.496 --> 23:33.760
I mean, I am a bit
senior to you,

23:33.760 --> 23:35.501
but we're both reporters,

23:35.501 --> 23:37.677
and you do scare
the hell out of me.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.679
Fear is good.

23:39.679 --> 23:40.984
Keeps things honest.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.204
Well, definitely gonna tell HR
you said that.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.162
You do,
and I'll destroy you.

23:47.904 --> 23:50.080
Look.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.561
Okay.
Here we go.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.655
Well, cue the bad-guy music.

24:12.755 --> 24:15.149
No...

24:15.149 --> 24:16.759
Way.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.852
Hey, Stanley.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.115
Are you still
in Anchorage?

24:25.115 --> 24:27.683
<i>Yeah, I had some work
to finish up. What's up?</i>

24:27.683 --> 24:30.251
We just found out who's
financing the new daily in town.

24:30.251 --> 24:31.905
It's your father.

24:35.299 --> 24:36.823
My father?

24:36.823 --> 24:39.260
He's merging
the Anchorage Eagle Blog

24:39.260 --> 24:41.610
with <i>The Wasilla Gazette,</i>

24:41.610 --> 24:43.830
and they're setting up
their new office

24:43.830 --> 24:46.485
in the old Harlan Oil building.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.141
<i>Aaron, I'd like to believe</i>

24:51.141 --> 24:52.621
<i>that this is
just business, but--</i>

24:52.621 --> 24:53.927
It's not.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.147
It's personal.

24:57.147 --> 24:59.628
<i>If I know my father,
he's gonna come after us</i>

24:59.628 --> 25:01.195
<i>with everything he's got.</i>

25:02.109 --> 25:04.285
That's how he works.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.722
You cut him, he destroys you.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.811
Understood.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.815
Thanks for calling, Stanley.

25:12.815 --> 25:13.860
<i>You got it.</i>

25:30.616 --> 25:32.531
What's up?

25:35.664 --> 25:38.232
They freed Toby
and arrested Ezra.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.323
Why don't I feel any better?

25:42.323 --> 25:45.021
They're just symptoms,
not the disease.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.893
We're not done yet.

25:53.334 --> 25:56.642
So, the moment of truth.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.687
Are you staying or going?

25:58.687 --> 26:01.560
Anchorage or New York?

26:03.387 --> 26:04.998
You first.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.698
I'm staying.

26:11.265 --> 26:14.964
The <i>Post</i> is a great paper.
Love to live in D.C.

26:14.964 --> 26:18.054
But this is my community.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.752
I still have a lot
of work to do here.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.278
The <i>Alaskan</i> is lucky
to have you.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.021
Your turn.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.244
Saved by the DM.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.855
And it's a doozy.

26:35.855 --> 26:38.248
From someone called
"Disillusioned."

26:38.248 --> 26:42.078
"You've shined a light in dark
places, but you're not done yet.

26:42.078 --> 26:45.821
LRS192. Happy hunting."

26:45.821 --> 26:48.911
LRS192? What the hell's that?

26:48.911 --> 26:51.827
Um, all I'm getting is
waste management,

26:51.827 --> 26:54.264
health services...

26:54.264 --> 26:56.005
road services.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.138
Ask them what we missed.

26:58.138 --> 26:59.879
"What do you mean,
we're not done yet?

26:59.879 --> 27:01.445
What did we miss?"

27:03.752 --> 27:06.189
"They knew what to do.
They just didn't do it."

27:06.189 --> 27:07.408
Who's they?

27:07.408 --> 27:10.280
"Who is they?"

27:11.978 --> 27:14.110
"Do your job. Investigate."

27:18.071 --> 27:19.289
Listen up, gang.

27:19.289 --> 27:22.205
Does anyone know
what LRS192 means?

27:22.205 --> 27:23.772
Competition
or a riddle?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.731
Both. Anyone?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.689
LRS192.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.997
Legislative
Research Services.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.955
Ugh.
I hate not winning.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.479
They publish reports
for the Alaska Legislature.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.438
- Michael for the win.
- He's right.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.787
Damn you, Michael.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.746
Anyone know where
those records are kept?

27:40.746 --> 27:44.010
The Legislative Information
Office on Minnesota and Benson.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.316
Got it.
Thanks, guys.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.024
Uh, there is
no report 192.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.809
No report 192?
At all?

28:00.809 --> 28:02.724
Nope.
Checked twice.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.901
Is there a report 191?

28:08.774 --> 28:10.819
Yep. Right here.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.213
What about report 193?

28:16.346 --> 28:17.826
Yep. Got it.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.915
So it's only report 192
that's missing?

28:19.915 --> 28:21.395
Yep. Weird.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.484
Sorry.

28:23.484 --> 28:25.399
Thanks.

28:25.399 --> 28:26.792
It's me.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.142
- LRS192 is missing.
<i>- Hm.</i>

28:29.142 --> 28:31.884
<i>Maybe we pay one more visit
to our old buddy Brenda.</i>

28:34.103 --> 28:35.757
Commissioner Haynes
will see you.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.845
She has five minutes.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.412
Should be enough.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.159
Maybe I should just have
a standing appointment

28:46.159 --> 28:47.421
for you two.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.857
Thanks for
squeezing us in.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.946
Well, actually,
I'm just curious.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.295
What else could you
possibly want?

28:52.295 --> 28:55.081
How about
file LRS192?

28:55.081 --> 28:56.386
What is that?

28:56.386 --> 29:00.086
Legislative Research Service
Report 192.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.828
We'd like to take a look at it,
but it's missing.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.612
Files go missing.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.962
It might be missing
'cause someone didn't
want it to be seen.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.398
We think
this is important.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.836
- Are you familiar with it?
- No, I'm not.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.229
It had something to do
with the MMIW crisis.

29:13.229 --> 29:16.406
- Look, we have a--
- Task force. We know.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.104
Did you bury the report?

29:18.104 --> 29:21.194
Did you erase it
from the LRS servers?

29:21.194 --> 29:23.892
You have no idea
how this system works.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.241
So tell us.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.113
Look, Thacker just threw you
under the bus

29:27.113 --> 29:28.375
at the press conference.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.072
This isn't the time
to be a good soldier.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.292
The Governor and I
have a great relationship.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.859
Do you?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.208
I have a source in Juneau
that tells me

29:35.208 --> 29:37.123
Thacker's shopping
your job.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.559
Don't pull
that crap with me.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.474
Brenda.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.563
This is one of
those times in life.

29:42.563 --> 29:43.999
Do the right thing here.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.088
Be on the right side
of history.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.005
I'm sorry, but I have
another appointment.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.878
Mm. So am I.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.973
- Love that woman.
- She's just the best.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.454
She didn't
give it to you?

30:04.454 --> 30:06.152
Nope.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.893
You're Disillusioned.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.112
You DM'd me, didn't you,
Mary Anne?

30:10.112 --> 30:11.374
I thought if I gave her
the chance

30:11.374 --> 30:14.029
to do the right thing,
she would.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.509
What's in the report?

30:18.077 --> 30:20.906
Real solutions to solve
the MMIW crisis,

30:20.906 --> 30:22.298
and they just ignored it.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.909
Can you get us a copy?

30:23.909 --> 30:26.346
- No.
- Who has it?

30:28.087 --> 30:30.350
Not sure.
A lot of people saw it.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.874
The Governor's
chief of staff, probably.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.486
She has one.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.098
But even if I could,
I-I wouldn't give it to you.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.317
So you're a loyal
whistleblower?

30:43.232 --> 30:44.538
Yeah.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.409
Guess I'm pretty
messed up, huh?

30:49.238 --> 30:50.936
Don't stop, okay?

30:55.114 --> 30:58.900
So you think they created this
report and then they ditched it?

30:58.900 --> 31:01.294
- Why?
- Money. Politics.

31:01.294 --> 31:02.948
Apathy. Racism.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.514
- All of the above.
- Stay on it.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.516
It feels like this is
at the heart of our reporting

31:06.516 --> 31:08.518
on the systemic problems.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.085
We need somebody to go
on the record.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.521
- We go back to Mary Anne.
- Doubt it.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.306
She's busted,
and not in a good way.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.525
Is there a good version
of busted?

31:15.525 --> 31:17.353
Me?

31:18.441 --> 31:19.921
I need caffeine. Anyone?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.923
- Always. Black.
- All right.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.624
Eileen.

31:37.069 --> 31:40.028
Commissioner.
Are you stalking me?

31:40.028 --> 31:42.291
My assistant quit today.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.947
She told me she's leaving
public service altogether.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.298
Well, if it helps,
she wouldn't turn on you.

31:49.298 --> 31:52.562
She told me she got into
politics because of me.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.565
And I was also the reason
she was leaving.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.263
Mary Anne cared.

31:57.263 --> 32:00.005
She believed she could
make a difference.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.571
Now she doesn't.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.965
That's tough.
I'm sorry.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.058
This is the report.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.763
Brenda, this is only good
if we know who made it go away.

32:19.763 --> 32:22.157
- We need a--
- Bad guy?

32:22.157 --> 32:23.767
There isn't just one.

32:23.767 --> 32:27.336
An assistant or deputy
or department head

32:27.336 --> 32:30.774
or chief of staff
or deputy chief.

32:30.774 --> 32:34.430
Any one or all of them could
have pulled it off the server.

32:34.430 --> 32:37.607
You don't need a bad guy
when you've got a bad culture.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.740
We still need a reason.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.264
You know the reason.

32:42.264 --> 32:45.050
It just wasn't a priority.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.616
It should have been.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.096
On the record?

32:49.793 --> 32:51.447
Yeah.

32:51.447 --> 32:54.059
On the damn record.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.321
Thanks.

34:03.128 --> 34:06.087
Let's get a read from Bob,
then it goes to legal and copy.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.656
Guys, she's here.

34:19.492 --> 34:22.016
I'm sorry to interrupt your day,

34:22.016 --> 34:24.105
but I just wanted
to take a moment

34:24.105 --> 34:26.020
to express my gratitude.

34:28.675 --> 34:31.112
When Eileen approached me

34:31.112 --> 34:34.681
about reporting on the murder
of my daughter, Gloria,

34:34.681 --> 34:36.465
I slammed the door
in her face.

34:38.598 --> 34:42.689
And then she returned with Roz,
and I would have done the same,

34:42.689 --> 34:45.126
except there was
no door to slam.

34:47.346 --> 34:51.480
So, I listened and watched

34:51.480 --> 34:55.223
with growing admiration and awe

34:55.223 --> 34:57.138
as these two women,

34:57.138 --> 35:01.099
with your support,
sought the truth.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.668
And just as the whale
gives itself to us

35:05.668 --> 35:10.195
when our intentions are right,
the truth gave itself to them.

35:12.545 --> 35:16.853
One or two people
cannot land the mighty Agviq.

35:16.853 --> 35:20.466
It takes a committed crew.

35:20.466 --> 35:25.297
God willing, your work will
prevent more of our women

35:25.297 --> 35:29.344
and men from suffering
the same fate as my Gloria.

My father is creating a paper

He wants a war.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.388
That's how he operates.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.652
And as your publisher,
I will tell you right now,

39:53.652 --> 39:55.436
he will not get one.

39:56.829 --> 40:02.356
Instead, we are gonna continue
to do what this paper does best.

40:02.356 --> 40:07.405
We will pursue the truth
fearlessly, without favor.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.451
We will give voice

on crime and corruption.

40:14.107 --> 40:15.978

40:15.978 --> 40:18.764
we'll correct it
and learn from it.
