reading interactively--

03:52.733 --> 03:54.291
"make it fun."

03:54.309 --> 03:55.976
Well, he said that to us, too,

03:56.128 --> 03:58.128
but we didn't believe him.

never to believe him.

tried to kiss or wear as a hat.

a wonderful, amazing son.

04:39.521 --> 04:40.687

like him?

04:59.875 --> 05:02.208

we blame Bart for throwing
our lives out of whack?

that we could see him

of ten years of parenting him.
