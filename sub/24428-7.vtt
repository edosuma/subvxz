WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:04.919
your self-assessment
tax return for this year,

00:04.920 --> 00:06.879
we estimate your company
to be in debit

00:06.880 --> 00:09.799
to the sum of 5,128 Denari."

00:09.800 --> 00:12.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God. Five grand?!</font>
Well, a bit more.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.359
<font color="#FFFF00">We're getting five big ones!</font>
Get in, my son!

00:15.360 --> 00:16.919
Hoo-hoo! Five biggies!

00:16.920 --> 00:19.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's buy a yacht! Oh, or a tiger!</font>

00:19.600 --> 00:21.359
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:21.360 --> 00:24.239
You guys don't know
what "debit" means, do you?

00:24.240 --> 00:26.320
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, shit. Is it the other one?</font>

00:27.960 --> 00:30.799
# Yeah!
When in Rome

00:30.800 --> 00:33.480
# Do as the Romans do

00:36.160 --> 00:38.119
# Far from home

00:38.120 --> 00:41.479
# All I got is you #

00:41.480 --> 00:43.999
So, it says we've got
one week to pay up

00:44.000 --> 00:45.919
or the bar will be liquidated.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.679
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, before I celebrate again,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what does that one mean?</font>

00:48.680 --> 00:50.679
It means finding other, proper jobs

00:50.680 --> 00:54.599
where we can't just eat nuts
and pretend to polish cups all day.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.199
And Jason, please,
please, stop running tabs.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it's just so much easier</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">than taking actual money.</font>

01:00.080 --> 01:03.959
That's the whole point. Taking money
is literally our only objective.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.319
I mean, who's Viggo?
<font color="#FFFF00">He's my barber.</font>

01:06.320 --> 01:09.639
Right, well, he apparently
owes us 570 Denari.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Nah. It's more like 500 now.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's been paying me back.</font>

01:12.480 --> 01:14.239
OK, good. And...

01:14.240 --> 01:16.759
Hang on, in money or...?
<font color="#FFFF00">Haircuts, yeah.</font>

01:16.760 --> 01:20.319
Right, that explains why you've had
five different styles this week.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos none of them have really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">settled. Know what I mean?</font>

01:22.760 --> 01:24.239
<font color="#FFFF00">What do you think of a mohawk?</font>

01:24.240 --> 01:26.239
I think stop getting haircuts,
mainly.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.279
And get the money he owes us.
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, chill. I'm going.</font>

01:29.280 --> 01:31.079
(CRUNCH UNDERFOOT)

01:31.080 --> 01:34.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Snails are back.</font>
Oh, not again.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.199
Grumio,
I thought you got rid of them.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.799
<font color="#FFFF00">I did. I suppose they just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like the vibe in here.</font>

01:38.800 --> 01:40.759
That's because the vibe
is damp and pooey.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.919
They'd stay away if you
cleaned this place up.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I am. Starting with these nuts.</font>

01:45.000 --> 01:47.919
No, start with the snails.
Just round 'em up.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.720
If they don't outpace you, that is.
(CRUNCH)

01:53.080 --> 01:55.840
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, blimey, it's a bloody massacre.</font>

01:56.960 --> 02:00.039
I'm just saying, a quiff would look
banging on you.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.719
<font color="#FFFF00">No, thanks. I've had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the same haircut for 28 years,</font>

02:02.720 --> 02:05.119
<font color="#FFFF00">so I'll probably</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stick with it till I die now.</font>

02:05.120 --> 02:08.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, Gloria. Hi. Sorry to interrupt</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your pegging.</font>

02:08.280 --> 02:10.799
<font color="#FFFF00">I was wondering if you could</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">give us some advice</font>

02:10.800 --> 02:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">about something a bit delicate?</font>
Ooh, go on. Sounds intriguing.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, we've just been hit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with a hefty tax bill</font>

02:16.600 --> 02:19.639
<font color="#FFFF00">and are wondering how to appeal it.</font>
Not so intriguing, it turns out.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.399
Um, no idea, I'm afraid.
I leave all that to my accountants.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.799
You might know them -
Shatzberg and Shatzberg.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.999
<font color="#FFFF00">No. Why would I know them?</font>

02:28.000 --> 02:31.479
Well, cos it's a small community.
I thought you all knew each other.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. I mean, I'm not Jewish.</font>

02:33.920 --> 02:38.239
Oh. Sorry, I thought you were.
<font color="#FFFF00">No way! So did I at first.</font>

02:38.240 --> 02:40.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos of the whole...</font>
And the personality.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.079
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, I am still here. </font>It was when I
saw his pecker weren't circumcised

02:44.080 --> 02:46.479
that I knew for sure.
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's leave it there, ideally.</font>

02:46.480 --> 02:49.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Thanks, anyway. </font>It turns out
it was intriguing after all.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Please don't discuss my pecker</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in front of Gloria.</font>

02:53.080 --> 02:56.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Or call it a pecker. It doesn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">make it sound very impressive.</font>

02:56.360 --> 02:59.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Hang on, where are we going?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">The barber's that way, isn't it?</font>

02:59.360 --> 03:01.000
Uh-huh, change of plan.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I am really not sure about this.</font>
It'll be fine. It suits you.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Their Almighty God won't like it.</font>

03:10.440 --> 03:12.479
<font color="#FFFF00">He might smite me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's one of his things.</font>

03:12.480 --> 03:14.919
Relax. No-one's getting smited.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.519
Just get in there and bag us
a bad-ass Jewish tax guru.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm.</font>

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074

03:33.160 --> 03:34.599
<font color="#FFFF00">'Ey up.</font>

03:34.600 --> 03:36.880
<font color="#FFFF00">How d'you get all the way</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">over there?</font>

03:37.920 --> 03:39.360
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, love.</font>

03:42.160 --> 03:44.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh.</font>

03:44.600 --> 03:48.239
See you later, man. Thanks a lot.
So, who's next?

03:48.240 --> 03:50.919
(LAUGHS) What's going on, bro?
Have a seat.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.359
<font color="#FFFF00">No, I'm not here</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for a cut this time, Viggo.</font>

03:53.360 --> 03:56.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I need to call in your bar tab.</font>
I hear you. No problem.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.839
Just a shame you have to do it now.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Give me what's there</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you ain't got it all.</font>
Oh, no. Shame for you.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.279
I just got the new look-book
in today.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.279
All the freshest styles.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, right. It's...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Nah, I shouldn't really.</font>

04:09.200 --> 04:10.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh.</font>
Check it out.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.919
See how it stands up.
And then it fades out.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.519
It's called the Gallic Box.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.879
Sick, innit?
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, that is extremely sick.</font>

04:16.880 --> 04:20.599
Ladies are gonna go bonkers
for the Box, trust me.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.920
But if you have to settle
that tab...

04:29.920 --> 04:31.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Salve, Grumio.</font>

04:31.440 --> 04:33.839
All right, Landlord?
<font color="#FFFF00">Busy day, then?</font>

04:33.840 --> 04:36.119
Yeah, you know, just taking
my new pet for a walk.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.079
Her name's Shelley.
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, nice.</font>

04:38.080 --> 04:40.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos of the shell.</font>
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.159
Lordy. Look at her go!

04:43.160 --> 04:45.759
She's dead nippy, isn't she?
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you kidding me? Nippy?</font>

04:45.760 --> 04:48.639
Fastest damn snail I've ever
spent the day watching.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.479
<font color="#FFFF00">As if. Any bozo from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my mum's cabbage patch</font>

04:51.480 --> 04:53.079
<font color="#FFFF00">would be just as fast as that div.</font>

04:53.080 --> 04:55.599
Do you want a bet?
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, any time, any time.</font>

04:55.600 --> 04:57.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's say 10 Dennies.</font>

04:57.440 --> 04:59.839
What do you reckon, Shelley, love?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.760
Shelley says, "Bring it on."

05:10.920 --> 05:12.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Shabbat Shalom.</font>
Oh, yes.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.119
Um... Thank you?

05:15.120 --> 05:17.239
<font color="#FFFF00">So who the hell are you, then?</font>

05:17.240 --> 05:20.359
Er, I... How do you mean?
<font color="#FFFF00">Take a look around.</font>

05:20.360 --> 05:23.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Most of the guys here</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are ancient and bearded.</font>

05:23.800 --> 05:27.559
<font color="#FFFF00">So when one shows up who isn't,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">people are gonna notice.</font>

05:27.560 --> 05:30.119
Right, yes. Well, I'm lapsed.

05:30.120 --> 05:34.359
And just wanted to reconnect
with the old Jewish...

05:34.360 --> 05:35.679
belief system.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Judaism.</font>
As it's known.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.199
And also to meet an accountant.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.239
I believe there's a Shatzberg
and also a Shatzberg

05:43.240 --> 05:45.199
in the community.
<font color="#FFFF00">There is.</font>

05:45.200 --> 05:48.039
<font color="#FFFF00">That's Solomon Shatzberg over there,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with one of the beards.</font>

05:48.040 --> 05:49.839
<font color="#FFFF00">He won't be able to help you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">though.</font>

05:49.840 --> 05:52.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I know for a fact</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's run off his feet.</font>

05:52.040 --> 05:53.919
Ah. And the other Shatzberg?

05:53.920 --> 05:56.639
<font color="#FFFF00">The other Shatzberg</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">might be able to fit you in.</font>

05:56.640 --> 05:57.919
Oh, fantastic.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.359
Er... which one's he?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.719
<font color="#FFFF00">"He" would be me.</font>

06:01.720 --> 06:03.839
Oh, shit, sorry.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.039
<font color="#FFFF00">It's fine, really.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Rebecca Shatzberg.</font>

06:06.040 --> 06:10.000
<font color="#FFFF00">It's good to meet you.</font>
Marcus. Gallo... berg.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I told you it would be fine.</font>
It was better than fine, mate.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.759
I got myself an accountant
who is female, hot

06:17.760 --> 06:20.439
and has invited me for
a slap-up family dinner.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.119
<font color="#FFFF00">All that for just plonking on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a little hat? </font>I know.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.439
I should've worn this ages ago.
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a very sharp look on you, bro.</font>

06:26.440 --> 06:29.199
Don't take advice from a man
with a loaf on his head.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Not a loaf. I'm wearing a sweet</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">new look called The Gallic Box.</font>

06:32.360 --> 06:33.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Ladies are gonna love it.</font>
Hm.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.239
So you've not called in
your tab with the barber?

06:36.240 --> 06:39.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Not yet, but this is my last</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">haircut. I swear down.</font>

06:39.080 --> 06:42.599
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll call in my tab tomorrow.</font>
Salve, boys. Are you open?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Evening, Landlord.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What can we get you?</font>

06:44.560 --> 06:46.559
A glass of wine for me, please,

06:46.560 --> 06:50.519
and a slice of humble pie
for Grumio.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.999
Because my snail here,
Mr Random Snail,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.239
is about to prove that
fast snails don't exist.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Whatever, mate.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Shelley's gonna fuck him up.</font>

06:58.680 --> 07:00.319
Nize! Are we having a snail race?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, sort of nize.</font>

07:01.720 --> 07:04.039
<font color="#FFFF00">You did say you'd take</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the snails out of the bar,</font>

07:04.040 --> 07:06.039
<font color="#FFFF00">not bring more in.</font>
Yeah, I know, I know.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.119
This is my last snail race.
I swear down.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you both for doing pretty much</font>

07:09.840 --> 07:12.119
<font color="#FFFF00">the exact opposite</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of what I asked you.</font>

07:12.120 --> 07:13.720
<font color="#FFFF00">As per bloody usual.</font>

07:15.440 --> 07:18.759
'Ey up, Shelley, love,
it's show-time.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.639
<font color="#FFFF00">In lane one, hailing from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Landlord's mother's allotment,</font>

07:21.640 --> 07:23.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Mr Random Snail.</font>

07:23.600 --> 07:25.399
Come on, you Random Bastard.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.919
<font color="#FFFF00">And in lane two, from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the Crown and Toga itself,</font>

07:27.920 --> 07:30.599
<font color="#FFFF00">local girl Shelley.</font>
Brrap, brrap, brrap!

07:30.600 --> 07:32.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Focus, Shelley, love.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't get distracted.</font>

07:32.720 --> 07:34.279
On your marks.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.559
Get set.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.160
(BLOWS WHISTLE)

07:44.320 --> 07:46.759
<font color="#FFFF00">Right, let's maybe get a drink</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and come back?</font>

07:46.760 --> 07:48.040
Yeah, good shout.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.039
(LAUGHTER)
<font color="#FFFF00">I must say, Mrs Shatzberg,</font>

07:52.040 --> 07:54.519
<font color="#FFFF00">this is the finest gefilte fish,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if not fish,</font>

07:54.520 --> 07:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I have ever eaten.</font>
So have a little more, then.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Oy vey,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what are you doing to me here?</font>

07:59.200 --> 08:01.759
<font color="#FFFF00">I won't need to eat all week.</font>
(LAUGHTER)

08:01.760 --> 08:04.559
Marcus runs his own bar, Tatty.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, very good. Would I know it?</font>

08:06.480 --> 08:08.959
It's the Crown and Toga.
On the Aventine.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.599
<font color="#FFFF00">The old toilet. Yeah,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've walked past it a few times.</font>

08:11.600 --> 08:13.319
Well, next time, come on in.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.959
<font color="#FFFF00">According to the menu outside,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it says you serve squid.</font>

08:16.960 --> 08:18.319
We do. It's delicious.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.919
<font color="#FFFF00">And squid isn't kosher.</font>

08:19.920 --> 08:23.679
I've heard it's delicious.
I've not tried it myself, obviously.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.999
I stick to our kosher dishes.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Right. Like what?</font>

08:28.040 --> 08:30.439
Like... er, well, we do gefilte fish.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm-hm. What else?</font>

08:32.039 --> 08:34.599
Potato kugel, anyone?
<font color="#FFFF00">Potato kugel. Yeah, we do that.</font>

08:34.600 --> 08:37.359
What else, that we haven't
already eaten tonight?

08:37.360 --> 08:39.558
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh, um...</font>

08:39.559 --> 08:41.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Let me think, um...</font>

08:41.240 --> 08:44.720
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, we also... do...</font>

08:46.400 --> 08:47.519
<font color="#FFFF00">..omelettes?</font>

08:47.520 --> 08:50.239
I practically live on omelettes.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.839
(LAUGHTER)

08:51.840 --> 08:54.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Tell me, Marcus,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what do you think of</font>

08:54.240 --> 08:56.599
<font color="#FFFF00">the political situation</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in Palestine?</font>

08:56.600 --> 09:00.039
Ugh. Well, you know,
it's complicated, isn't it?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Is it? Complicated how?</font>

09:01.800 --> 09:04.519
Give it a rest, Simon, we're
not doing politics tonight.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.079
And I really think we should take
a look at your accounts, Marcus.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Of course. Shame.</font>

09:09.800 --> 09:12.519
<font color="#FFFF00">I love talking about Palestine.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, well.</font>

09:12.520 --> 09:14.560
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you so much for dinner.</font>

09:18.000 --> 09:20.159
Come on...
<font color="#FFFF00">Move it, Random!</font>

09:20.160 --> 09:22.479
Nearly there, Shelley. Yes...

09:22.480 --> 09:24.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi, wake up, dickhead.</font>
Oh!

09:24.160 --> 09:26.399
We have a winner. Which one's that?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.879
<font color="#FFFF00">It's Shelley. Shelley's the winner.</font>
Nice one, Random, you lazy twat.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.759
(CRUNCH)
<font color="#FFFF00">That's a bit dark.</font>

09:31.760 --> 09:34.039
Best thing for it.
He couldn't hack the pace.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.599
<font color="#FFFF00">That's 10 Dennies, I believe.</font>

09:35.600 --> 09:39.079
Sorry I doubted you, Grumio,
fast snails are a thing.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.119
For our next race, I shall find
myself a proper little mover.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, I dunno about that. I promised</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Marcus it were a one-off.</font>

09:46.080 --> 09:48.079
Too late. I'm into it now.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.279
And I'm gonna step it up a level.
I'm talking 10 lanes.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.519
Big money.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes!</font>

09:52.520 --> 09:54.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Can we get some hotties</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to present the trophies?</font>

09:54.880 --> 09:56.759
Sure - hotties, trophies, the lot.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.439
Unless Shelley's ready to retire?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Er...</font>

10:01.560 --> 10:05.079
They haven't taken into account
the small business exemptions,

10:05.080 --> 10:07.759
the cost of refurbishment,
your payroll.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.719
<font color="#FFFF00">So, can you get the bill reduced?</font>

10:09.720 --> 10:12.359
Of course. It's what I do.
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh.</font>

10:12.360 --> 10:15.079
As long as we cite legitimate
expenses in the appeal,

10:15.080 --> 10:17.959
then, Baruch Hashem,
I think we can get it down to zero.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry? Zero as in nothing?</font>

10:19.720 --> 10:21.959
That's what zero usually means.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.080
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHS) You're incredible.</font>

10:28.240 --> 10:30.599
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.359
<font color="#FFFF00">No, no, it's fine. I mean,</font>

10:32.360 --> 10:35.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I get turned on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by financial savings as well.</font>

10:35.320 --> 10:39.319
I make financial savings every day
but meeting a nice Jewish boy,

10:39.320 --> 10:41.200
that's extremely rare.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh. No. Maybe we shouldn't.</font>

10:48.000 --> 10:50.679
Really? Why? Don't you want to?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.839
<font color="#FFFF00">No, I do.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I really want to... do that.</font>

10:52.840 --> 10:56.759
<font color="#FFFF00">It's just... I feel bad,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with your parents in the next room.</font>

10:56.760 --> 11:00.719
<font color="#FFFF00">As a nice Jewish boy, I wouldn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want to... disrespect them, so...</font>

11:00.720 --> 11:05.639
Wow. Hot, charming and respectful.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.119
You really are the whole package.

11:08.120 --> 11:12.560
So, we should get you
onto a pension scheme.

11:14.078 --> 11:15.645
<font color="#FFFF00">But she didn't see your pecker?</font>

11:15.672 --> 11:19.231
No, I managed to stop her before
she came eye to eye with it.

11:19.232 --> 11:21.871
But I've also got her brother
all up in my face,

11:21.872 --> 11:23.671
quizzing me about forbidden food.

11:23.672 --> 11:25.711
<font color="#FFFF00">Why would food be forbidden?</font>
I don't know.

11:25.712 --> 11:28.271
I guess their God Jehovah's
just quite a fussy eater.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.271
I've been swatting up on the rules.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.271
So, for now, we have to take pork
and squid off the menu pronto

11:33.272 --> 11:35.671
and you can get your slimy snail
out of there too.

11:35.672 --> 11:38.631
<font color="#FFFF00">What, why? There's nothing piggy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">or squiddy about Shelley.</font>

11:38.632 --> 11:41.111
No, but she's a mollusc.
<font color="#FFFF00">Eff off. YOU'RE a mollusc.</font>

11:41.112 --> 11:44.071
As in, she's not kosher.
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not gonna eat her.</font>

11:44.072 --> 11:45.791
We can't take any risks, Grumio.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.551
So long as we don't trip up on
my foreskin or your mollusc,

11:48.552 --> 11:50.271
it is bye-bye tax bill

11:50.272 --> 11:53.031
and welcome back your lovely,
lazy lives of leisure.

11:53.032 --> 11:54.591
<font color="#FFFF00">Amen.</font>

11:54.592 --> 11:56.191
<font color="#FFFF00">Jehovah be praised.</font>

11:56.192 --> 11:59.112
Well, it's mainly me, but
all right... cheers, Jehovah.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.671
<font color="#FFFF00">Mollusc, my big balls.</font>

12:03.672 --> 12:05.871
<font color="#FFFF00">You're not a mollusc,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are you, Shelley?</font>

12:05.872 --> 12:08.191
<font color="#FFFF00">No, you're a bloody champion.</font>

12:08.192 --> 12:11.632
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, now, then.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Where did you lot come from?</font>

12:12.632 --> 12:14.151
<font color="#FFFF00">Get out of it.</font>

12:14.152 --> 12:16.951
OK, kosher or no-sher?

12:16.952 --> 12:18.711
Cheese steak?
<font color="#FFFF00">No-sher.</font>

12:18.712 --> 12:20.871
<font color="#FFFF00">Can't mix meat and dairy.</font>
Correct.

12:20.872 --> 12:22.671
What about mackerel pate?
<font color="#FFFF00">Kosher.</font>

12:22.672 --> 12:24.991
<font color="#FFFF00">A mackerel has fins and scales,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my friend.</font>

12:24.992 --> 12:27.911
Of course it does.
In which case, mazel tov.

12:27.912 --> 12:29.351
Your training is complete.

12:29.352 --> 12:30.871
I mean, foreskin aside,

12:30.872 --> 12:33.231
you're basically
one of God's chosen people.

12:33.232 --> 12:34.991
<font color="#FFFF00">I like to think I already was.</font>

12:34.992 --> 12:36.631
Right, I'm gonna bounce.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.511
This steam is wilting my Box.

12:38.512 --> 12:39.992
<font color="#FFFF00">Sure, see you back at the bar.</font>

12:41.192 --> 12:42.832
<font color="#FFFF00">Call in that tab.</font>

12:48.832 --> 12:51.551
Viggo...
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey, what's happening, man?</font>

12:51.552 --> 12:54.871
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry, mate, I really need to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">call in your tab this time, OK?</font>

12:54.872 --> 12:57.831
<font color="#FFFF00">No more haircuts.</font>
No problem. I'll get you the cash.

12:57.832 --> 13:00.391
Give me a second, OK?
<font color="#FFFF00">Sure, no worries.</font>

13:00.392 --> 13:04.311
Aurelius. What are you doing here?
<font color="#FFFF00">Getting my hair cut, weirdly.</font>

13:04.312 --> 13:06.431
Whoa, hey, no. Nuh-uh.

13:06.432 --> 13:07.671
You can't copy my Box.

13:07.672 --> 13:10.431
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not copying your Box.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted one anyway.</font>

13:10.432 --> 13:11.951
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a very fresh look.</font>
I know,

13:11.952 --> 13:14.071
but not if you have one as well.

13:14.072 --> 13:16.192
<font color="#FFFF00">Shall I fetch the look-book?</font>

13:23.432 --> 13:24.751
Marcus!

13:24.752 --> 13:26.951
<font color="#FFFF00">Simon, hi.</font>

13:26.952 --> 13:29.311
<font color="#FFFF00">Didn't see you there.</font>
Well, I saw you.

13:29.312 --> 13:31.071
And I saw it.

13:31.072 --> 13:32.991
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry? You saw what?</font>

13:32.992 --> 13:35.072
Your shmecky, Marcus. I saw it.

13:36.272 --> 13:38.391
<font color="#FFFF00">And? Do you not have one?</font>

13:38.392 --> 13:41.431
Not like that.
Your one has a sleeve.

13:41.432 --> 13:44.071
<font color="#FFFF00">Pfff! I don't think so, mate.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You made a mistake.</font>

13:44.072 --> 13:46.311
Did I? Well, let's find out.
<font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>

13:46.312 --> 13:48.431
<font color="#FFFF00">What are you doing?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Get off. Get off!</font>

13:48.432 --> 13:50.311
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi, ah, let go!</font>

13:50.312 --> 13:52.391
Here we are.
<font color="#FFFF00">(SHRIEKS) This is assault!</font>

13:52.392 --> 13:54.391
I can feel it.
<font color="#FFFF00">No. That's the scrotum.</font>

13:54.392 --> 13:56.111
I can feel the foreskin.

13:56.112 --> 13:57.831
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, fine. Fine!</font>

13:57.832 --> 13:59.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got a foreskin.</font>

13:59.392 --> 14:02.271
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, I just haven't got round to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">being circumcised yet.</font>

14:02.272 --> 14:05.591
Haven't got round to it? It gets
done when you're eight days old.

14:05.592 --> 14:07.111
<font color="#FFFF00">So I'm a bit late. So what?</font>

14:07.112 --> 14:10.071
So you're not a Jew at all, are you?
Selling your squid

14:10.072 --> 14:12.511
with your foreskin flapping about
all over the place.

14:12.512 --> 14:15.592
You're just a lying Roman goy,
aren't you? Aren't you?

14:16.672 --> 14:18.031
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

14:18.032 --> 14:19.911
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you going to tell Rebecca?</font>

14:19.912 --> 14:22.191
Well, I don't want to humiliate her.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.471
So as long as you agree to
stay out of her life,

14:24.472 --> 14:26.551
for ever, I'll keep shtum.

14:26.552 --> 14:27.791
<font color="#FFFF00">OK. Thank you.</font>

14:27.792 --> 14:29.791
But if you darken our door again,

14:29.792 --> 14:33.152
I'll expose that foreskin faster
than you can say "potato kugel".

14:35.312 --> 14:37.072
(SNIFFS) Gross.

14:42.392 --> 14:45.191
<font color="#FFFF00">That's it. I am through</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with being a Jew.</font>

14:45.192 --> 14:48.871
<font color="#FFFF00">The brother saw, or rather felt,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my foreskin at the bathhouse.</font>

14:48.872 --> 14:52.071
Oh, shit. So what now?
<font color="#FFFF00">So now I can't see Rebecca again.</font>

14:52.072 --> 14:54.391
<font color="#FFFF00">You know what that means?</font>
Get circumcised.

14:54.392 --> 14:57.711
<font color="#FFFF00">What? No, it means we have to pay</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">our massive tax bill.</font>

14:57.712 --> 14:59.911
<font color="#FFFF00">Of course I'm not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">getting circumcised.</font>

14:59.912 --> 15:01.431
Why not? It's a piece of piss.

15:01.432 --> 15:04.471
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, is it, Grumio? You do it, then.</font>
I will. Would that help?

15:04.472 --> 15:06.671
<font color="#FFFF00">It would help me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It would make my day</font>

15:06.672 --> 15:08.551
<font color="#FFFF00">to watch someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">slice your dick off.</font>

15:08.552 --> 15:10.591
It's not the whole dick.
It's just the tip.

15:10.592 --> 15:13.671
You can go back to Rebecca and say
the brother made the whole thing up.

15:13.672 --> 15:15.631
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not getting circumcised, OK?</font>

15:15.632 --> 15:18.551
<font color="#FFFF00">Stop devising scenarios</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in which I get circumcised.</font>

15:18.552 --> 15:20.111
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not happening.</font>

15:20.112 --> 15:22.191
<font color="#FFFF00">Look, the tax bill is five grand.</font>

15:22.192 --> 15:24.792
<font color="#FFFF00">Right?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">So how much do we have in cash?</font>

15:26.352 --> 15:28.151
About 700, I think.
<font color="#FFFF00">Uh-huh.</font>

15:28.152 --> 15:31.111
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, plus the 500</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from the barber's, right?</font>

15:31.112 --> 15:33.831
<font color="#FFFF00">From your silence</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and stupid new haircut,</font>

15:33.832 --> 15:35.631
<font color="#FFFF00">I guess that's a no.</font>
In my defence,

15:35.632 --> 15:38.751
I had to get the Etruscan Fin
cos Aurelius copied my Gallic Box.

15:38.752 --> 15:40.551
<font color="#FFFF00">I actually prefer that one.</font>
Really?

15:40.552 --> 15:42.951
I think maybe Viggo
took a bit too much off.

15:42.952 --> 15:45.351
<font color="#FFFF00">So we're a mere four and a half</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">big ones short.</font>

15:45.352 --> 15:48.991
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done, everyone.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We can wave goodbye to this place.</font>

15:48.992 --> 15:51.471
I know how we can get the big ones.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.151
<font color="#FFFF00">What? How?</font>

15:53.152 --> 15:56.111
So, you know you told me not to do
any more snail racing and that?

15:56.112 --> 15:58.191
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes?</font>
Well, instead,

15:58.192 --> 16:00.151
I set up another
even bigger snail race

16:00.152 --> 16:01.951
tonight with Landlord
and his mates.

16:01.952 --> 16:03.431
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, fantastic news.</font>

16:03.432 --> 16:05.751
It's a 500 Denari buy-in.
Winner takes all.

16:05.752 --> 16:08.271
Landlord reckons there'll be
quite a few runners.

16:08.272 --> 16:10.111
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh, I like where this is going.</font>

16:10.112 --> 16:11.751
I don't. I hate where this is going.

16:11.752 --> 16:14.271
We are not staking everything
on a snail.

16:14.272 --> 16:17.231
<font color="#FFFF00">Why not? She breezed past</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Landlord's chump last time.</font>

16:17.232 --> 16:18.711
Shelley's a winner. Fact.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.631

Right, mystery solved.
