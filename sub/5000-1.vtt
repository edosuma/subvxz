03:44.023 --> 03:46.287
You ain't leaving
that baby here...

03:46.326 --> 03:48.157
not hollering like
that, you ain't.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.000
Yo, girl! Hey, baby!

03:59.105 --> 04:01.096
Come on over here
and get warm.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.404
Come on, now.

04:08.481 --> 04:12.315
We gonna trade you
some good shit!

04:12.352 --> 04:15.378
Come on, you can have
a little bit of this.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.389
Come on, now.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.587
You know, we know
what you need.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.118
Come on, baby.

04:23.162 --> 04:25.562
Okay, Isaiah.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.590
There you go, okay? Shh.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.227
I'll be right back, okay?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.170
That's right.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.502
Okay, okay.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.108
Okay, there you go.

04:42.181 --> 04:45.446
Okay.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.675
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.979
I'm telling you, man,
the Bulls are going to repeat.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.984
Yeah, yeah, you said the same
thing after the '85 Bears.

05:53.052 --> 05:53.984
Ain't gonna happen.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.645
The Knicks have got Pat Riley,

05:55.688 --> 05:57.918
and he's going to make
Patrick Ewing play some ball.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.083
Hey, you got

05:59.125 --> 06:01.423
B.J. coming off
the bench, shooting a three.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.294
I'm thinking about coming out of
retirement and playing myself.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.422
Yeah, I heard that.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.632
I know one thing...

06:08.668 --> 06:09.635
I can stop Ewing.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.432
I just have to deal
with Oakley's muscle

06:11.471 --> 06:12.438
underneath the board.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.337
I-I used to play
some great defense.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.932
They used to call me "The Wall."

06:16.008 --> 06:18.533
Yeah... wall-eyed Wally.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.637
Yeah, Oakley under the boards,
my butt.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.705
M.J. and Scottie'll
take care of the Knicks.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.307
Pippen's bad.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.114
The Knicks are playing
some mean D.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.417
Hey, did you see what Jordan did
to that defense last night?

06:29.455 --> 06:30.683
That's what
I'm talking about!

06:30.723 --> 06:32.190
- Swoosh!
- I wouldn't trade defense...

06:32.225 --> 06:34.523
Hey, hey, you got B.J.
Coming off...

06:34.560 --> 06:35.788
Holy shit!

06:35.828 --> 06:37.295
Stop the blade!

06:37.330 --> 06:39.798
Stop the blade! Stop it!

06:49.008 --> 06:50.839
What's he been given?

06:50.877 --> 06:52.310
Two cc's epinephrine, I.M.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.972
- Let's get him to the warmer.
- It's over there!

06:54.013 --> 06:57.676
Let's roll! Get out of the way...
baby coming!

06:57.717 --> 06:59.207
All right.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.221
Okay, let's get
some new vitals on him.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.483
What do we got here?

07:03.523 --> 07:05.218
I need a half-normal saline

07:05.258 --> 07:07.488
with glucose drip,
and get me a respirator.

07:07.527 --> 07:08.824
- Hold it, hold it.
- Wait.

07:08.861 --> 07:09.828
Where's the IV?

07:09.862 --> 07:10.829
- No IV established?
- No.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.763
- Why not?
- Not ready to get a line in.

07:12.799 --> 07:13.766
Okay, 24-gauge ampule.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.767
I'll do it myself.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.893
Go ahead, hold that, yeah.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.664
Let me have a blood gas.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.864
He's a subdermal hematoma,
Mrs. Lanelli.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.032
He's five months old.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.200
You didn't think he might
roll off that top bunk?

07:23.242 --> 07:24.470
He never did it before.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.535
Well, now you know
it's possible.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.604
He's not Peter Pan.
He can't fly.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.479
We need you.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.040
You're going to have
to wait here

07:32.084 --> 07:33.608
until the x rays get back.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.247
At least she didn't dump him
in a pot of boiling water, huh?

07:36.289 --> 07:39.224
Yeah, she did that last month...
said his bath was too hot.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.316
What have we got?

07:40.359 --> 07:42.793
This one was found
in a dumpster.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.457
Jesus.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.631
- Social Services?
- Mm-hmm?

07:48.668 --> 07:50.295
He's not breathing on his own.

07:50.336 --> 07:51.428
Can you sign off?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.438
Sign off?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.303
Yeah. No extraordinary measures.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.399
Why don't we just dump him back
in the garbage?

07:56.442 --> 07:57.431
All right, lady...

07:57.477 --> 07:59.274
play God.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.045
Anyone got the paperwork
on Mr. Romano?

08:05.852 --> 08:07.615
It's tachycardia.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.779
BP's down.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.152
Respiratory's erratic.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.723
- BP up.
- It looks like a brain bleed.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.725
Keep the oxygen up.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.250
This infant's having a seizure.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.126
Uh, doctor!

08:18.164 --> 08:19.495
Phenobarbital, stat.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.466
Let's get him up to NICU.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.832
What'd I tell you?

08:24.937 --> 08:26.461
Hold the elevator!

08:27.874 --> 08:30.172
Damn it,
hold that elevator!

09:03.709 --> 09:05.301
Oh, my God!

09:05.344 --> 09:07.312
Oh, my God, my baby! My baby!

09:07.346 --> 09:09.041
- Shut up, ho!
- Where's my baby!

09:09.081 --> 09:10.912
Had enough racket around here!

09:11.017 --> 09:13.485
Police! Dead babies!

09:13.519 --> 09:15.384
Get out of here!

09:15.421 --> 09:18.652
I said get out my alley!

09:20.393 --> 09:22.258
Get!

09:22.295 --> 09:24.593
My baby...

09:36.042 --> 09:38.272
I know all the tubes and wires
are frightening,

09:38.311 --> 09:39.278
but you can hold him.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.870
Okay.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.312
Ain't this
a cute baby?

09:42.348 --> 09:43.508
Oh, there you go.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.517
- Excuse me, Margaret.
- Shh. What?

09:45.551 --> 09:47.314
That baby you asked about
last round?

09:47.353 --> 09:49.082
- Yeah?
- He's in NICU.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.952
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Thank you.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.888
Just talk to him.
He'll be all right.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.586
His prints
were on the computer.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.595
He was born at Cook County
three days ago.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.324
Mother and baby
both crack-addicted.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.128
He's over there:
Isaiah Richards.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.600
Huh.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.762
Nurse Forgen to East Wing Two.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.337
Isaiah.

10:20.987 --> 10:24.684
"And he shall be called
wonderful."

10:28.594 --> 10:31.586
Dr. Parks, 6214.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.122
Dr. Parks, 6214.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.063
- Look at her.
- Yeah.

11:11.103 --> 11:12.297
- Just asking for it.
- Yeah.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.932
Arrest her. The little thief.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.642
Where's the party?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.178
Hey...

11:30.222 --> 11:31.985
Come on.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.322
Pay the nice man.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.328
Get off me.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.922
One, two, three.
Crazy. Beautiful. Maybe.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.025
Come on...

11:48.974 --> 11:51.841
Oh, look what we got here.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.943
Now, see what you
made me do?

11:55.981 --> 11:59.678
You have to use every dish in
the house, Charick Lewin-sky?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.415
Ja, I do, but I'll clean up.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.946
I know you will.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.457
Is she home?

12:06.492 --> 12:07.720
Yeah, she's in her room,

12:07.760 --> 12:09.091
on the phone, door closed,

12:09.128 --> 12:11.392
waiting for you to tell her
she has a French quiz

12:11.430 --> 12:13.660
and a history paper
due tomorrow.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.064
You have a French quiz

12:15.101 --> 12:17.126
and a history paper
due tomorrow.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.568
Just a minute.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.128
I'm on the phone.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.639
That's easy to fix.
Get off it.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.335
Will you please get
out of my room

12:23.375 --> 12:24.637
so I can study?

12:24.677 --> 12:26.645
Oh, I think you might
want to phrase that

12:26.679 --> 12:27.976
a little differently, honey.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.676
Can I call you back?
My mother's being a jerk.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.845
Mom, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.320
Thank you.

12:36.355 --> 12:41.349
This is gone if you don't
do well on the exam tomorrow.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.691
...and hairline fractures

12:43.729 --> 12:45.492
of the clavicle and cranium.

12:45.531 --> 12:46.998
Burns and old scarring.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.090
Maggie, what are you,

12:48.134 --> 12:50.102
a social worker
or a war correspondent?

12:50.136 --> 12:51.899
War correspondent.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.564
Recommend foster care to avoid

12:53.606 --> 12:55.198
further trauma to this child.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.004
The old scar tissue
indicates...

12:57.042 --> 12:58.703
Uh, would you say
"multiple lacerations

12:58.744 --> 13:00.609
to the upper torso"
one more time, please?

13:00.646 --> 13:02.273
No.

13:02.314 --> 13:04.373
Patient continues
to have trauma...

13:04.416 --> 13:05.940
"Hairline fracture."

13:05.985 --> 13:08.476
- No. No.
- Hmm?

13:08.521 --> 13:12.150
"Burns and old scarring"?

13:12.191 --> 13:14.421
No.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.087
We continue to explore...

13:16.128 --> 13:19.291
Charlie... would you
scratch my back?

13:19.331 --> 13:20.889
No.

13:20.933 --> 13:26.337
Next case, B-14-20.
Child shows signs

13:26.372 --> 13:28.932
of forced responsiveness
to his environment...

13:36.615 --> 13:38.082
Yeah?

13:38.117 --> 13:39.948
Cranial contusion.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.581
How did you get this number?

13:44.623 --> 13:47.649
I could meet you somewhere...
anywhere.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.422
Show you the x rays.

13:49.461 --> 13:53.090
Uh, oh, d-don't you have
a st-staff meeting tonight?

13:53.132 --> 13:55.100
It's canceled.

13:55.134 --> 13:58.934
Uh, Margaret, I can't, um...

13:58.971 --> 14:02.134
I got a whole pile
of screwed-up wirings

14:02.174 --> 14:04.335
got to be worked out
by tomorrow.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.934
Oh, well.

14:06.011 --> 14:11.210
There's a surgeon here
who's just dying to show me

14:11.250 --> 14:13.718
some new suture-tying
techniques.

14:39.845 --> 14:40.937
Let's go!

14:40.980 --> 14:42.709
Take all your belongings!

14:42.748 --> 14:44.579
Let's go!

14:44.617 --> 14:46.551
Come on, come on!

14:46.585 --> 14:48.109
Get off me!

14:48.153 --> 14:49.120
Move it, move it!

14:49.154 --> 14:50.121
Get out the way!

14:50.155 --> 14:51.087
Move!

14:54.927 --> 14:56.986
Get off me!

14:57.096 --> 15:00.088
Move it! Move it!

15:02.001 --> 15:03.559
Your names are on your beds.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.901
You'll be expected to keep
your area clean at all times.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.304
Now, there are those of you

15:08.340 --> 15:10.433
who elected this program
to cut your time.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.205
Well, if that's why you're here,

15:12.244 --> 15:14.838
you better turn around
and get back on that bus,

15:14.880 --> 15:16.438
because you won't last a day.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.747
This is work... hard work.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.049
One mistake... one...

15:22.087 --> 15:25.420
and you're out on your
base-head, pill-popping,

15:25.457 --> 15:28.722
alcoholic asses,
back in the general population

15:28.761 --> 15:31.093
quicker than you can
blink your eyes.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.257
Understand?

15:36.035 --> 15:37.900
I don't know.
What do you want me to say, hmm?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.370
I mean,
I've only been recommending

15:39.405 --> 15:40.872
permanent foster care
for that child

15:40.906 --> 15:42.840
for four years now.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.570
No, no, go ahead...

15:44.610 --> 15:46.771
send her back if that's
what the courts want.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.178
But listen, you tell that
son-of-a-bitch judge...

15:49.215 --> 15:51.615
that if her father
finally kills her,

15:51.650 --> 15:54.118
not to come weeping to me.

16:09.635 --> 16:14.402
<i>... nothing says</i>
<i>I would wish it to be.</i>

16:15.574 --> 16:18.407
That's my grandma's song.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.610
Yeah, she would've liked you.

16:22.648 --> 16:27.051
You're a little fighter,
aren't you, huh?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.816
Beans, beets, rice.

16:30.856 --> 16:31.948
Hey, Ethel.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.959
- There you go.
- Oh, let's see.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.154
Give me just some rice
and veggies.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.560
- Rice and veggies.
- Thanks.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.156
You've been a social worker
for what, 15 years?

16:40.199 --> 16:41.666
Mm-hmm.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.726
Let's say a nice,
well-meaning white lady

16:44.770 --> 16:47.261
came into your office
and told you

16:47.306 --> 16:50.434
she was thinking of taking
a black crack baby home,

16:50.476 --> 16:53.570
thinking she could save it.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.375
What would you say?

16:57.516 --> 16:58.983
Not to.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.248
It's insane, Margaret.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.914
A black crack baby...
it's insane.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.479
There's nothing wrong with him.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.492
Well, he could have problems
that won't show up for years.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.925
So could we.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.396
Look, Charlie,
you haven't seen him.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.525
I mean, there's something
so great about him.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.058
He has... he has this spirit.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.933
You can see it in his eyes.

17:19.003 --> 17:20.800
And he has nothing.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.204
He's so all alone.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.368
You're lying,
you know you're lying.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.844
Is you for real?

17:26.878 --> 17:27.936
Bullshit.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.947
You-you really think your kids
don't know

17:30.049 --> 17:31.209
that you turning tricks?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.478
What are they, retarded?

17:32.518 --> 17:34.042
Is anybody talking to you?

17:34.086 --> 17:35.678
Where your kids think
you is right now...

17:35.721 --> 17:37.689
on a Carnival cruise
or some shit?

17:37.723 --> 17:38.690
Shut up, okay?

17:38.724 --> 17:39.952
Like your kids
don't know

17:40.059 --> 17:41.321
what you be doing
late at night?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.294
Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.797
She just trying to help
your lying butt... that's all.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.230
Yeah, I'm just trying to help
your lying ass.

17:49.101 --> 17:50.068
Shh, shh.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.296
Whoa, yo!

17:51.337 --> 17:53.237
It don't do no good
to beat on each other

17:53.272 --> 17:56.332
about shit we did when we was
bugging and drugging.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.070
Huh?

17:58.110 --> 18:00.408
Now, come on,
let's look at this thing

18:00.446 --> 18:01.845
from a positive place.

18:03.048 --> 18:07.917
What kind of mother
would you like to be?

18:07.953 --> 18:11.719
One your kids can
depend on coming up?

18:14.960 --> 18:16.587
Sade?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.494
I don't have nothing to say.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.725
See?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.234
Khaila, what about your kids?

18:25.004 --> 18:28.337
I ain't got no kids.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.908
Here, look where you are.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.214
- I'll park the car.
- Okay.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.553
That always happens, though.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.819
Look.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.918
Oh, my God, Mom.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.326
Here he is.

18:50.362 --> 18:51.852
He's so small.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.125
Mm-hmm.

18:53.165 --> 18:56.191
C-Can I call you back? Bye.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.901
Oh...

18:59.938 --> 19:02.236
How do you get clothes
that small?

19:02.274 --> 19:03.639
Leprechauns.

19:04.910 --> 19:08.778
This is your sister,
little guy.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.555
Shh, shh...

19:20.592 --> 19:21.786
Can I hold him?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.158
Yes.

19:23.195 --> 19:27.131
Watch his head.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.134
What do I do?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.136
Just rock him a little bit,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.661
but-but don't look
right in his face, okay?

19:33.706 --> 19:36.675
Crack babies sometimes
have trouble with that.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.108
Hey there, small stuff.

19:38.143 --> 19:41.442
That's what your daddy
used to call you.

19:45.951 --> 19:50.047
Oh... coochie coochie coo.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.692
He doesn't like me.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.660
It's not that, Hannah.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.152
Of course he likes you.
It's not that.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.859
Where are you going?

20:00.899 --> 20:03.060
I told Jenny I'd come over.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.900
You're not upset,
are you, Hannah?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.565
No.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.972
Well, why don't you bring
her back to see the baby?

20:10.008 --> 20:11.407
I don't think so.

20:11.443 --> 20:12.808
Why not?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.904
Well, be home by 5:00.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.438
Bye.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.145
Oh, I forgot the formula.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.751
Shh, shh, shh.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.988
Shh...

20:43.675 --> 20:46.439
What'd we learn today, buddy?
You keep your...

20:46.478 --> 20:49.003
- Eye... eye on the ball!
- That's right, and then,

20:49.114 --> 20:51.844
when you swing the bat,
you got to swing...

20:51.884 --> 20:53.852
- Level!
- Level, level, right.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.319
- Level!
- And then what do you do

20:55.354 --> 20:56.446
when you hit the ball?

20:56.488 --> 20:58.513
What do you got to do?
You got to...

20:58.557 --> 20:59.717
- Run like crazy!
- Run like crazy!

20:59.758 --> 21:01.817
You run to first base, and
then he goes to second base.

21:01.860 --> 21:05.728
- Second base!
- Then he goes to third base.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.959
- Then he goes to third base.
- Then he slides

21:08.066 --> 21:09.693
all the way home!

21:09.735 --> 21:11.430
And then he goes
all the way home!

21:11.470 --> 21:13.768
Right.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.505
Ooh, you giving your daddy's
hair a cream rinse?

21:21.547 --> 21:23.981
- I hit a home run! Wham!
- Where are you going?

21:24.082 --> 21:25.174
To Carrie's.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.616
No, no, no, no,
wait a minute now.

21:26.652 --> 21:27.778
Mom...

21:27.820 --> 21:29.185
No, listen,
I got this letter,

21:29.221 --> 21:30.984
and I want to read it
to you... listen.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.523
"It is accordingly

21:32.558 --> 21:35.994
"therefore ordered
that Isaiah Richards,

21:36.094 --> 21:37.755
- a minor..."
- That's me!

21:37.796 --> 21:39.457
"Shall be, to all

21:39.498 --> 21:41.557
"legal intents and purposes,

21:41.600 --> 21:45.195
the child of Charles
and Margaret Lewin."

21:45.237 --> 21:47.637
Poor kid... you're stuck
with them now.

21:47.673 --> 21:48.970
Very funny.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.201
No, wait, Hannah, don't go.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.675
Don't go. We want to celebrate.

21:51.710 --> 21:52.972
Mom, I can't.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.535
- Yes, you...
- Not tonight.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.013
Bye, kiddo.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.743
Kiddo! Kiddo! Kiddo! Kiddo!

21:57.783 --> 21:59.546
Hannah...

21:59.585 --> 22:00.711
I'll call.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.084
Kiddo, kiddo! Kiddo!

22:03.121 --> 22:05.885
You know, just because
she's a teenager...

22:05.924 --> 22:07.391
Kiddo, kiddo, kiddo, kiddo...

22:07.426 --> 22:08.484
Ooh.

22:08.527 --> 22:09.892
Do you want to go out?

22:09.928 --> 22:12.624
Oh, you know he can't sit still
in a restaurant.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.462
Take this. Ugh!

22:15.501 --> 22:17.401
All right, let's call out
for a pizza.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.097
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.901
We'll get him to bed early,
then, uh, you and I can...

22:21.940 --> 22:24.238
- What shape is a pizza?
- A big bowl like this!

22:24.276 --> 22:26.335
What's that called?

22:46.398 --> 22:49.299
- Mommy.
- Excuse me.

22:49.334 --> 22:52.098
Sorry.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.695
Glad you made it.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.086
You see who it is up there?

23:15.127 --> 23:16.685
It's Hannah.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.070
Mommy, look!

23:26.104 --> 23:27.628
Isaiah, shh.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.118
Hannah! Hannah!

23:51.797 --> 23:53.697
Boo!

23:59.905 --> 24:00.997
No!

24:01.106 --> 24:03.040
No! No!

24:20.292 --> 24:21.520
Just stop it.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.400
Yeah!

24:35.440 --> 24:36.566
Why did you even bring him?

24:36.608 --> 24:37.768
It was my play.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.970
You knew he would do
something like this.

24:40.078 --> 24:41.602
He always does.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.137
Yes, and you know
he cannot help it.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.739
Hey!

24:44.783 --> 24:47.980
Hannah, he's...
he ju... Oh...

24:48.020 --> 24:49.885
You know he adores you.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.548
Just try not to be so angry.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.989
I'm not angry!

24:53.058 --> 24:54.525
Yes, you are,
and it's okay.

24:54.559 --> 24:55.992
Oh, please.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.861
He was so proud of you...

24:58.897 --> 25:00.728
jumping up and down,
calling out your name.

25:00.766 --> 25:01.858
Yeah, I know.

25:01.900 --> 25:02.924
I heard him.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.993
And so did everybody else.

25:13.979 --> 25:17.176
I just wanted Mom to see it.

25:29.494 --> 25:30.893
Hannah?

25:30.929 --> 25:32.294
What?

25:32.330 --> 25:33.763
Can I tell you something?

25:33.799 --> 25:35.858
Yeah, whatever, Mom.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.401
When I heard you sing tonight...

25:48.013 --> 25:49.981
I thought, "There's Hannah,

25:50.015 --> 25:52.415
doing something
I can't begin to do."

25:52.451 --> 25:54.681
Right.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.655
It gave me such pleasure.

26:06.331 --> 26:09.698
Good morning!

26:09.735 --> 26:10.929
Good morning.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.095
What you doing?

26:12.137 --> 26:14.071
Jumping.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.937
Boy, your mama ain't teach you
to knock

26:16.008 --> 26:18.272
before you just come
barging in somebody's room?

26:18.310 --> 26:20.335
This is my room.
Aunt Joe said.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.540
We just lending it to you.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.209
No, you just renting it.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.184
You better get your little
skinny self dressed

26:27.219 --> 26:29.187
if you're going to
go to school today.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.347
Daycare.

26:30.389 --> 26:34.155
Well, you got to be dressed
for daycare, too.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.251
They ain't gonna take you
in no pajamas.

26:36.295 --> 26:39.287
Josette's in the bathroom.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.765
Don't I know it.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.960
Josie, let's go.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.901
You better wake up Mama, Amir.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.131
I ain't taking you
to no daycare.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.979
Come on, Amir.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.004
I'll take you.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.160
Amir!

27:09.194 --> 27:11.560
Where's my sugar?

27:14.733 --> 27:16.724
Thank you. Go.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.623
- Khaila.
- Hey.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.786
Excuse me.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.954
Got your living situation

27:43.995 --> 27:45.121
straightened out?

27:45.163 --> 27:47.154
Mm-hmm.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.190
Job?

27:53.538 --> 27:55.665
I'd appreciate an answer.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.642
I got a room.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.942
You ever had a room
to yourself before?

28:03.448 --> 28:05.916
Then stop complaining.

28:05.951 --> 28:09.352
Let's get to work.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.379
You been reading?

28:11.423 --> 28:12.913
Some.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.549
Some ain't good enough.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.755
Well, the book is dumb.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.526
How you know
if you ain't been reading it?

28:20.565 --> 28:23.227
'Cause I am reading it.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.236
Good.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.238
So, tell me...

28:27.272 --> 28:29.934
what's been happening with

28:29.975 --> 28:32.443
George...

28:32.477 --> 28:34.604
and Katherine?

28:34.646 --> 28:39.515
Kath-er-ine done gone
and got herself knocked up.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.848
She happy?

28:45.323 --> 28:47.587
Don't say.

28:49.795 --> 28:52.093
Why you doing this, Khaila?

28:52.130 --> 28:56.396
Oh, we're gonna share now?

28:57.669 --> 29:01.127
You're wasting our time here.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.607
Let's just forget about it,
'cause it's useless

29:03.642 --> 29:04.904
unless you want to do it.

29:04.976 --> 29:06.409
I already know how to read.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.777
Well, I don't want
to read this bullshit.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.406
Then why you busting my ass?

29:10.449 --> 29:13.748
Look, I have my lunch
sitting at home waiting on me.

29:24.129 --> 29:28.190
"Kath-er-ine visits the clinic.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.201
"The doctor tells her

29:30.235 --> 29:34.433
"to be careful
about what she eat.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.464
"It can help...

29:36.508 --> 29:39.739
"her...

29:39.778 --> 29:43.179
"baby... grow strong.

29:50.922 --> 29:56.417
"She must drink lots of milk
and eat green

29:56.461 --> 30:01.899
"ve-ge-ta-bles if she want
to be a good mother.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.127
The doctor..."

30:03.168 --> 30:04.294
Khaila, what's the matter?

30:04.336 --> 30:06.736
"...tells her
not to drink any

30:06.771 --> 30:11.435
"al-co-hol
or take any me-di-cine.

30:11.476 --> 30:15.242
"It could harm her...

30:15.280 --> 30:18.272
"baby.

30:18.316 --> 30:22.184
She should get lots of sleep."

30:23.922 --> 30:25.947
Khaila?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.982
Look at me.

30:33.198 --> 30:36.395
What's wrong?

30:38.970 --> 30:41.029
I threw him away.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.199
My baby.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.974
Threw him in the garbage can.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.445
I killed him.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.684
Killed him.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.856
Oh, God.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.988
Oh, my God.

31:19.644 --> 31:22.204
You got a book about that?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.528
Hey, how you doing?

31:37.562 --> 31:39.553
Hi.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.963
Oh.

31:54.145 --> 31:55.544
Hello?!

31:55.580 --> 31:57.980
Amir?!

31:58.016 --> 32:00.143
Josie?!

32:01.820 --> 32:04.448
Oh, my...

32:04.489 --> 32:05.649
What happened?

32:05.690 --> 32:07.715
They gone in the ambulance.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.831
She was bleeding
all over the bed.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.357
She wouldn't move.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.700
I cooked supper,
and I went to call her,

32:19.738 --> 32:21.706
but she wouldn't move.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.300
Doctor say she lost a baby.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.469
What baby?

32:26.511 --> 32:29.241
Hey, little man.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.145
You okay?

32:33.018 --> 32:34.508
Y'all hungry?

32:34.552 --> 32:36.486
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.732
Whoo! Whoo, yeah.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.903
Can I give you
a hand there?

32:59.944 --> 33:01.138
No, I got it.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.113
You sure? I got a little cousin
about that age.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.843
You know, they can do damage
to your back.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.475
I said I got it.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.247
Okay.

33:08.286 --> 33:11.221
Lord, boy, you heavy.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.554
Mama...

33:13.591 --> 33:15.218
It's okay. Go back to sleep.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.251
I'm going to stay
with you tonight.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.661
Pizza.

33:19.698 --> 33:23.828
You gonna have your pizza.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.353
I'm sor...

33:51.396 --> 33:52.920
Eddie Hughes.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.262
You know, I didn't
meet you before.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.133
I got to get back inside.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.694
To your kids?

34:00.739 --> 34:01.865
They ain't my kids,

34:01.906 --> 34:04.033
and why you got to be lurking
up here on my floor?

34:04.075 --> 34:05.201
I'm not lurking.

34:05.243 --> 34:06.767
I'm just having a smoke.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.641
Well, smoke somewhere else,
goddamn it.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.513
I'm a working man on vacation...

34:11.549 --> 34:13.540
up from Tampa.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.280
You ever been to Tampa?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.311
Oh, this look like
a vacation spot to you?

34:19.424 --> 34:22.824
Actually, my brother lives here.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.159
Yeah, you know,
he don't like to smoke, so...

34:27.165 --> 34:29.326
I'm just visiting him.

34:29.367 --> 34:30.958
We're, uh...

34:31.002 --> 34:33.061
we're in the music business.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.799
Mm-hmm.

34:34.839 --> 34:36.830
I was just, uh...

34:36.875 --> 34:40.242
working on a song about, uh...

34:40.277 --> 34:42.405
concrete.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.108
Check it out.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.402
I got to work
on the melody a little bit.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.910
I hope you good
at something else.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.339
- Hello, Mama.
- Uh, Khaila.

35:45.376 --> 35:48.106
Uh, there's some leftover pasta
in the fridge...

35:48.146 --> 35:49.272
Bye, Khaila. So long, sweetpea.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.305
And, uh, laundry needs
to go in the dryer.

35:51.349 --> 35:52.316
I'm out the door, honey.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.510
Okay.

35:55.353 --> 35:56.820
Give me a kiss. Mwa!

35:56.855 --> 35:58.652
Oh, I might be
a few minutes late tonight,

35:58.690 --> 36:00.681
but you can stay, huh?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.152
Bye, girls.

36:16.241 --> 36:17.765
The Fredericks residence.

36:17.809 --> 36:18.935
Khaila?

36:19.043 --> 36:20.271
Yeah?

36:20.311 --> 36:21.505
It's Gussie.

36:21.546 --> 36:24.174
Can we meet somewhere?

36:28.119 --> 36:30.815
He ain't dead?

36:32.824 --> 36:34.985
My baby ain't dead?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.487
Well, now, where is he?

36:40.531 --> 36:43.967
In the city,
living with a family in DePaul.

36:44.068 --> 36:47.003
Well...

36:50.008 --> 36:52.203
Well, I got to see him.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.268
Slow down, Khaila.

36:54.312 --> 36:56.371
There are a lot of issues
involved here.

36:56.414 --> 36:59.281
He's been legally adopted.

36:59.317 --> 37:01.877
So? I got to see my baby,
Gussie.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.080
Where is he?

37:03.121 --> 37:04.611
Okay, we're going to work
on that,

37:04.656 --> 37:06.123
but it's going
to take some time.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.591
- No. Come on, let's go.
- I'm on your side.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.355
I'm going to help you,
but it's going

37:10.395 --> 37:12.295
- No, no, no, no, no.
- To take some time,

37:12.330 --> 37:14.594
and you're going to have
to be patient, Khaila.

37:14.632 --> 37:15.758
I can't be patient.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.926
- Listen.
- I need to see my baby.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.559
Listen to me,
listen to me, Khaila.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.730
Don't let

37:20.772 --> 37:24.401
everything you worked
so hard for fall apart.

38:00.812 --> 38:01.938
Hey,

38:01.980 --> 38:03.345
what are you doing in here?

38:03.381 --> 38:04.575
Nothing.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.276
Looking for Gussie.

38:06.317 --> 38:07.545
Oh, she's in the hall.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.576
Thanks.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.618
- I'll call you tonight.
- Yeah.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.324
Pop the hood.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.370
See you, buddy.

38:27.405 --> 38:29.498
- Bye.
- I'll call you tonight.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.531
- Bye, Daddy, bye, Daddy.
- Have a good trip.

38:31.576 --> 38:32.634
Take your ticket.

38:32.677 --> 38:33.939
Take me, please.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.071
You wouldn't like it, sweetie.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.082
It's in a big city with...
it smells,

38:38.116 --> 38:41.608
in a big room
with men with no hair.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.711
Bye, Daddy.

38:43.755 --> 38:44.881
Bye, Daddy.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.082
Sorry.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.923
Oh, don't be sad.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.622
Daddy will be back
in two days.

38:51.662 --> 38:52.788
Look who's here.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.923
Aw... two days.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.332
You know what two is?

38:57.368 --> 39:00.428
One, two... that's not long.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.598
Besides, Heidi's going
to take you to the park now.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.039
Then after the park,

39:04.075 --> 39:05.906
you're going to take a nap,

39:05.977 --> 39:07.842
and drink your apple juice.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.540
Use your sipper cup.

39:09.580 --> 39:12.105
And Mama's going
to come home

39:12.150 --> 39:13.913
right after work like
I always do, okay?

39:13.951 --> 39:15.145
Good night.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.154
Uh-huh, and you're going
to draw me a picture?

39:17.188 --> 39:18.155
Yes.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.713
- Of what? Of an airplane?
- Yes.

39:19.757 --> 39:21.657
With two wings,
flying up in the sky.

39:21.692 --> 39:26.356
- Up in the sky!
- Up in the sky, yeah.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.922
How many wings
does an airplane have?

39:28.966 --> 39:30.160
Two.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.294
Two! How many hands
does Isaiah have?

39:32.336 --> 39:33.462
Two.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.335
And how many eyes
does Isaiah have?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.533
Two.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.667
And how many kisses
is Mama going to get?

39:38.709 --> 39:39.767
Two.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.675
Oh, you're my boy.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.080
Okay, have fun at the park.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.448
I want to race.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.544
Okay. Bye-bye, honey.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.851
Bye, Mommy.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.824
W-W-W-W-Whee!

39:54.859 --> 39:57.885
Okay, now, guess
where we're going?

39:57.929 --> 39:58.896
Where?

39:58.930 --> 40:01.262
To the park.

40:10.174 --> 40:13.701
What are you going to go on
when you go in there first, huh?

40:13.744 --> 40:15.735
The slide?

40:19.317 --> 40:21.717
Ah, push.

40:25.022 --> 40:28.321
Ready? One, two, three, up.

40:28.359 --> 40:31.294
Good boy. Okay.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.991
Heidi, over here.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.497
How you doing?

40:35.533 --> 40:36.557
Good.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.660
So, can you come?

40:38.703 --> 40:39.931
I don't know.

40:39.971 --> 40:40.995
I'm pretty tired.

40:41.038 --> 40:42.005
So, can you get off?

40:42.073 --> 40:43.131
I don't know.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.438
They're supposed to go out.

41:22.547 --> 41:24.947
Hello, Isaiah.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.973
I get so nervous.

41:27.084 --> 41:30.781
Hi.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.749
Hello?

42:51.102 --> 42:52.592
Hello?

42:52.637 --> 42:54.537
Miss Richards.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.005
You're late.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.597
I'm sorry.

43:02.781 --> 43:05.841
Gussie said
you was a real good lawyer.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.785
Yeah. Now, she's explained
some of this to me,

43:08.820 --> 43:11.254
but there's still
a lot of holes here.

43:11.289 --> 43:15.055
She tells me you'd like to
reinstate your parental rights.

43:19.798 --> 43:21.766
You gave your child
up for adoption.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.960
Now you want him back.

43:23.067 --> 43:27.231
No, I never gave my child up
for no adoption.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.671
You left him in an alley.

43:28.706 --> 43:29.798
You abandoned him

43:29.841 --> 43:31.604
and made no effort
to find him again.

43:31.643 --> 43:33.133
Legally, that's the same thing.

43:35.447 --> 43:38.075
Well, that's 'cause
I thought he was dead.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.879
No one ever sent you any letters

43:39.918 --> 43:41.681
informing you
of his whereabouts?

43:41.719 --> 43:43.687
Nope.

43:43.721 --> 43:46.451
Or of the Lewins'
intent to adopt him?

43:46.491 --> 43:48.755
Mm-mmm.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.192
Now, Miss Richards,
you know

43:50.228 --> 43:51.388
you couldn't read very well

43:51.429 --> 43:53.124
before you went into
the rehab program.

43:53.164 --> 43:55.462
You sure you didn't throw
away any official papers?

43:55.500 --> 43:58.992
No. I ain't never got no papers.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.437
Not even in jail?

44:01.473 --> 44:03.634
If I would've got some papers
like that,

44:03.675 --> 44:05.768
don't you think
I would've remembered?

44:14.018 --> 44:16.714
You don't like me all that much,
do you?

44:16.754 --> 44:18.619
I don't like what put you in

44:18.656 --> 44:20.715
this situation, Miss Richards.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.892
How do I know that when
I help you get your boy back,

44:24.929 --> 44:26.829
you're not going to go back
to smoking rock

44:26.865 --> 44:28.127
and leave him again?

44:28.166 --> 44:32.068
'Cause I'm telling you
I'm through with all that.

44:32.103 --> 44:34.298
Oh, well,
that's what you all say.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.933
You ain't got
to talk down to me.

44:36.975 --> 44:38.203
I can pay.

44:38.243 --> 44:39.608
There's no fee involved here.

44:39.644 --> 44:41.839
We take on cases
that are socially relevant.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.939
If we win them,
they set legal precedent.

44:43.982 --> 44:46.314
Your case fits that profile.

44:46.351 --> 44:49.149
The fee's taken care of
by donations.

44:51.489 --> 44:53.354
It's going to be tough.

44:53.391 --> 44:55.518
The family he's with is white,

44:55.560 --> 44:57.118
they treated him well.

44:57.161 --> 44:59.186
They'll fight this.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.300
But I'm his mother.

45:05.336 --> 45:06.769
Well, I'm sure that white woman

45:06.804 --> 45:08.362
feels fairly strongly
that she is,

45:08.406 --> 45:10.874
and there are a lot of people
who'll agree with her.

45:26.357 --> 45:28.052
Mommy, pussycat.

45:28.092 --> 45:32.222
The owl and the pussycat...

45:32.263 --> 45:34.754
Went to sea.

45:34.799 --> 45:38.496
In a beautiful pea-green...

45:38.536 --> 45:39.901
Boat.

45:39.938 --> 45:41.405
They took some...

45:41.439 --> 45:42.599
Honey.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.801
And plenty of...

45:44.842 --> 45:46.309
Money.

45:46.344 --> 45:54.183
Wrapped up
in a five-pound... note.

45:54.218 --> 45:57.016
Night-night, sweet boy.

46:39.030 --> 46:40.327
Charlie?

46:40.365 --> 46:42.026
Margaret, hello.

46:44.268 --> 46:45.667
She wants him back.

46:45.703 --> 46:46.897
What?

46:46.938 --> 46:49.202
Who? Who wants him back?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.208
I don't know.

46:51.242 --> 46:54.109
We got a letter
from some legal service.

46:54.145 --> 46:57.114
She never signed away
her rights.

46:57.148 --> 47:00.174
She's going to challenge
the adoption.

47:00.218 --> 47:02.778
Where did she come from?

47:06.824 --> 47:09.918
What are we going to do?

47:09.961 --> 47:12.088
Listen, sweetheart,
it-it's going to be all right.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.256
No, it's not.

47:13.297 --> 47:15.424
Mommy, I want Daddy.

47:15.466 --> 47:17.195
Oh...

47:17.235 --> 47:19.669
Mommy, I want Daddy.

47:21.305 --> 47:23.398
Daddy's not home.

47:23.441 --> 47:25.807
I want Daddy.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.333
So do I.

47:27.378 --> 47:29.938
I want him to be here.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.641
I want Daddy.

47:31.683 --> 47:33.947
She's claiming she never
received any notice

47:34.052 --> 47:35.576
to terminate
parental rights.

47:35.620 --> 47:36.780
That can't be.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.584
You handled that yourself,
right?

47:38.623 --> 47:41.490
Look, this is what I do
for a living.

47:41.526 --> 47:45.963
I followed every procedure...
the newspaper notifications,

47:46.030 --> 47:48.828
computer checks of prisons,
the welfare rolls...

47:48.866 --> 47:51.061
I mean, we even hired
a-a private detective

47:51.102 --> 47:53.195
with our own money
to look for relatives,

47:53.237 --> 47:55.102
but you can't find
somebody on the street

47:55.139 --> 47:56.572
if they don't want to be found.

47:56.607 --> 47:58.268
And what does it matter, anyway?

47:58.309 --> 48:00.641
The adoption is final...
it can't be reversed.

48:00.678 --> 48:03.010
Oh, I'm afraid it can.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.912
The court can vacate a judgment

48:04.982 --> 48:07.109
if it was entered
into by default,

48:07.151 --> 48:09.585
and it will vacate
if there's a child involved.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.679
She's going to have a right
to be heard.

48:11.723 --> 48:14.123
We're talking about a woman
who is a junkie,

48:14.158 --> 48:15.921
who put her kid
in a garbage can.

48:15.993 --> 48:17.688
Someone who should be arrested,

48:17.729 --> 48:19.663
not given back
her parental rights.

48:19.697 --> 48:23.565
Well, that's what
you'll have to prove.

48:23.601 --> 48:25.125
Look, I know you came to me

48:25.169 --> 48:27.034
because you thought
it would help

48:27.071 --> 48:28.504
to have a black attorney,

48:28.539 --> 48:31.133
but understand this is
a difficult situation.

48:31.175 --> 48:33.541
Is that a polite way
of saying no?

48:33.578 --> 48:36.445
I said I'd think
about it, and I will.

48:36.481 --> 48:38.415
This isn't a simple issue.

48:38.449 --> 48:39.939
You might raise a black child

48:39.984 --> 48:42.714
with the best intentions
in the world, colorblind,

48:42.754 --> 48:45.587
but in the end,
the world is still out there.

48:45.623 --> 48:47.147
He needs to know who he is.

48:47.191 --> 48:50.058
A child should be
with his parents.

48:50.094 --> 48:52.085
We agree there.

48:54.565 --> 48:58.592
Whoo... pretty.

48:58.636 --> 49:00.866
Again. More bubbles.

49:00.905 --> 49:03.567
More bubbles, Hannah.

49:06.077 --> 49:07.635
More!

49:07.678 --> 49:09.043
More, more!

49:09.080 --> 49:12.709
Come on, Isaiah,
we've been doing this all day.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.775
More bubbles, Hannah!

49:14.819 --> 49:16.810
Bubbles!

49:18.723 --> 49:20.588
Isaiah.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.684
- Give me that.
- Isaiah.

49:22.727 --> 49:25.195
Isaiah, look at our hands.

49:28.432 --> 49:30.059
What's different about them?

49:30.101 --> 49:32.331
My hand's smaller.

49:32.370 --> 49:34.531
Bubbles, bubbles!

49:42.914 --> 49:46.281
Hannah, come set the table
for dinner.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.959
Stop switching channels.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.223
I want to see some cartoons.

49:58.262 --> 50:00.457
Give me that thing, boy.

50:00.498 --> 50:01.726
Oh, hey.

50:05.102 --> 50:06.364
Where's your mama?

50:06.404 --> 50:07.632
Out.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.731
Girl, is you crazy?

50:09.774 --> 50:13.175
You don't just let some strange
man come walking up in here.

50:13.211 --> 50:15.645
He gave us all this TV stuff.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.944
Hey, little man, help me
put all these tools away

50:17.982 --> 50:19.847
and clean this mess up,
and I'll show you

50:19.884 --> 50:21.442
how to work
the video games, okay?

50:21.485 --> 50:22.747
Yeah.

50:22.787 --> 50:25.085
Help him put
all them tools away,

50:25.122 --> 50:27.249
so he can get on out of here.

50:27.291 --> 50:28.952
Look, I didn't mean nothing
by all this.

50:28.993 --> 50:30.620
I just thought the kids
would like it.

50:30.661 --> 50:32.288
Mmm.

50:32.330 --> 50:34.696
Hey, there's a <i>Scooby</i>- <i>Doo</i>
marathon on tonight.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.495
Yeah...!

50:36.534 --> 50:38.468
Well, you can Scooby-Doo
your butt on out of here.

50:38.502 --> 50:39.491
Let's go.

50:42.907 --> 50:43.896
Here.

50:43.941 --> 50:46.341
No, no, you keep that,
all right?

50:46.377 --> 50:49.403
Remember what I said:
Honorary cable man.

50:49.447 --> 50:51.381
See you later.

50:51.415 --> 50:53.178
Don't wait up for me.

50:53.217 --> 50:54.343
Why are you

50:54.385 --> 50:55.682
so mean to him?

50:55.720 --> 50:58.985
He act kind of stupid,
but he's nice.

50:59.023 --> 51:03.255
Yeah, real stupid...
and a little too nice.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.201
Hey, pretty lady, how you doing?

51:13.237 --> 51:15.762
Why don't you let me
carry that for you?

51:15.806 --> 51:17.831
I'm doing just
fine by myself.

51:17.875 --> 51:19.103
Oh, come on, I got it.

51:19.143 --> 51:21.839
Now, see, look, now,
was that so hard? Come on.

51:21.879 --> 51:24.404
There you go.

51:24.448 --> 51:25.710
Let me ask you something.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.274
What did I do
that was so bad?

51:27.318 --> 51:28.683
You ain't had no business

51:28.719 --> 51:30.584
walking in on them kids
like that.

51:30.621 --> 51:34.489
You didn't like my singing
much either, right?

51:34.525 --> 51:35.753
What's happening?

51:35.793 --> 51:37.420
So, what kind of
music do you like?

51:37.461 --> 51:38.519
None of your business.

51:38.562 --> 51:40.860
Bet you like rap, right?

51:40.898 --> 51:44.595
Dr. Dre, Salt & Pepa, right?

51:44.635 --> 51:47.001
See, that's why
I can't get no gigs.

51:47.038 --> 51:49.563
These youngsters today...
they don't even know

51:49.607 --> 51:51.336
what a bass guitar
sounds like.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.707
You know what the key
to playing bass is?

51:53.744 --> 51:57.009
Nope... and I really don't care.

51:58.749 --> 52:00.011
Thank you.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.641
Big hands.

52:01.686 --> 52:03.119
See that?

52:05.022 --> 52:07.286
That's pitiful.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.191
I like you.

52:10.227 --> 52:12.559
You don't know nothing about me.

52:12.596 --> 52:15.565
Well, do me a favor...
tell me something.

52:15.599 --> 52:17.590
I don't like
fast-talking brothers

52:17.635 --> 52:18.966
who get up in my face.

52:19.003 --> 52:20.334
Well, there you go.

52:20.371 --> 52:22.896
I like pretty ladies
that don't like

52:22.940 --> 52:26.307
fast-talking brothers
who get up in their face.

52:37.955 --> 52:39.286
Later.

52:44.495 --> 52:47.487
All right.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.431
Sorry. Had to bring her.

52:53.471 --> 52:56.167
Miss Fredericks is going to
kill me if she find out.

52:56.207 --> 52:58.266
I don't think the child
will tell her.

53:02.079 --> 53:03.876
How much does this place cost?

53:03.914 --> 53:05.074
It's $300 a month.

53:05.116 --> 53:09.485
You crazy? I can't
afford no $300 a month.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.284
Well, how much
can you afford?

53:12.323 --> 53:14.450
I don't know. Maybe $150.

53:14.492 --> 53:15.459
That way.

53:15.493 --> 53:16.824
If I stop saving.

53:16.861 --> 53:19.159
Well, we'll get the rest
taken care of

53:19.196 --> 53:20.925
by Aid to Dependent Children.

53:20.965 --> 53:23.695
I ain't got no
dependent children.

53:23.734 --> 53:25.634
Oh, you will.

53:33.310 --> 53:36.973
All right, get it cleaned up,
find some furniture,

53:37.048 --> 53:38.515
and fix the window.

53:39.750 --> 53:40.717
For what?

53:40.751 --> 53:42.582
It's just gonna get broke again.

53:42.620 --> 53:44.178
Somebody gonna look in here

53:44.221 --> 53:45.984
and see what I got and take it.

53:46.057 --> 53:48.890
Fix it so the sun can shine in,
so you can look out,

53:48.926 --> 53:50.985
watch your boy play
in the courtyard.

53:51.095 --> 53:55.225
And get rid of your boyfriend.

53:57.368 --> 53:59.461
I ain't got no boyfriend.

53:59.503 --> 54:03.166
Eddie Hughes?

54:03.207 --> 54:05.937
Oh, so, you spying on me now?

54:06.010 --> 54:07.102
It's part of my job.

54:07.144 --> 54:08.236
They're going to try

54:08.279 --> 54:10.577
and make you look
like the Devil in court.

54:10.614 --> 54:13.481
There can't be anything
you do to help them.

54:14.618 --> 54:16.586
He's married.

54:16.620 --> 54:18.645
He ain't married.

54:18.689 --> 54:20.384
You asked him?

54:21.992 --> 54:23.516
You jealous?

54:26.430 --> 54:29.957
Don't flatter yourself.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.525
This goes way beyond you.

54:32.570 --> 54:36.506
Black babies belong
with black mothers.

54:36.540 --> 54:39.941
I'm not going to let you
do anything to mess that up.

54:39.977 --> 54:42.810
Now, you break it off
with this guy,

54:42.847 --> 54:44.439
or I drop the case.

54:49.587 --> 54:52.283
This is your first place,
isn't it?

54:54.458 --> 54:57.291
Yeah.

55:01.599 --> 55:02.896
Welcome home.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.741
I'm leaving.

55:18.782 --> 55:19.749
Not without paying

55:19.783 --> 55:21.717
for the rest of the time
you owe, you ain't.

55:21.752 --> 55:23.947
Why Khaila gotta go, Mom?

55:24.021 --> 55:26.581
Shut up, boy. My head hurts.

55:26.624 --> 55:27.921
I don't want her to go.

55:27.958 --> 55:29.721
Don't nobody care
what you want!

55:29.760 --> 55:30.954
Now go on out of here!

55:31.061 --> 55:33.621
Tell Josette to comb the naps
out your head!

55:33.664 --> 55:35.655
Do something. Go!

55:36.767 --> 55:38.394
What you looking at?

55:38.435 --> 55:41.802
It ain't right for you
to talk to him like that.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.363
Well, when you get your own kid,

55:43.407 --> 55:45.739
you talk to him the way
you want to talk to him.

55:45.776 --> 55:49.212
This kid here is mine... mine!

55:49.246 --> 55:50.770
Just take your funky ass

55:50.814 --> 55:52.907
outta here if you going!

55:52.950 --> 55:54.440
Bye.

55:54.485 --> 55:56.009
Go on. Leave!

56:20.277 --> 56:22.643
Hello, sweetheart.

56:24.148 --> 56:25.547
How'd you find me?

56:25.583 --> 56:26.880
Ah. Shorty Big-head.

56:26.917 --> 56:29.044
Gave him a pack
of Now & Laters...

56:29.086 --> 56:30.747
he gave you up like that.

56:30.788 --> 56:32.949
Hi, Khaila.

56:33.023 --> 56:34.081
Hi.

56:34.124 --> 56:36.024
Come on, guys.

56:38.862 --> 56:41.888
Ooh, your place is nice.

56:41.932 --> 56:44.492
Yeah. All this furniture.

56:44.535 --> 56:46.298
Why didn't you tell me
you were moving?

56:46.337 --> 56:48.237
You know, I would've helped
or something.

56:48.272 --> 56:50.240
This your boy's?

56:50.274 --> 56:51.263
Mm-hmm.

56:51.308 --> 56:53.208
Where he at?

56:53.244 --> 56:55.872
I told you that
a hundred times already.

56:55.913 --> 56:58.438
Put that stuff down.
That ain't yours.

56:58.482 --> 57:00.313
Check it out.

57:00.351 --> 57:01.545
I got four tickets

57:01.585 --> 57:03.917
to the James Brown concert
tonight.

57:03.954 --> 57:06.013
I know you think my music
is older than dirt,

57:06.056 --> 57:07.421
but I'm going
to show you that

57:07.458 --> 57:08.686
it can still be funky.

57:08.726 --> 57:10.250
Hey!

57:10.294 --> 57:13.695
Dirt... that's something
you should know a lot about.

57:15.899 --> 57:17.833
Kids, sit tight.

57:17.868 --> 57:20.496
Would you...
outside, please?

57:21.505 --> 57:22.665
Humor me.

57:26.810 --> 57:29.005
Give me that.

57:31.148 --> 57:34.242
You want to tell me
something?

57:34.285 --> 57:37.880
Uh-uh. Maybe you ought
to tell me something.

57:37.921 --> 57:40.822
Okay. What do you
want to know?

57:40.858 --> 57:41.825
Huh?

57:41.859 --> 57:44.794
Maybe about... your wife?

57:44.828 --> 57:47.092
Okay.

57:51.535 --> 57:55.528
We're separated... all right?
We don't even talk.

57:55.572 --> 57:58.973
Oh, you on vacation
from that, too?

57:59.076 --> 58:00.737
Khaila...

58:00.778 --> 58:03.042
you know,
it's a whole big mess, and...

58:03.080 --> 58:04.911
I didn't want to get into...

58:05.015 --> 58:06.983
But you still married.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.920
It don't mean nothing.

58:11.955 --> 58:13.923
Oh, it don't?

58:13.991 --> 58:15.390
Don't mean nothing?

58:15.426 --> 58:17.758
Don't mean nothing
at all, huh?

58:17.795 --> 58:19.763
I'm not trying to run a game
on you, Khaila.

58:19.797 --> 58:20.821
Somebody is always

58:20.864 --> 58:22.855
trying to run a game on me.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.128
You ain't no different.

58:24.168 --> 58:26.568
Walking around here
carrying groceries,

58:26.603 --> 58:28.901
singing little silly songs
and shit.

58:28.939 --> 58:30.406
You ain't nothing.

58:30.441 --> 58:33.308
You just like every other
sorry ass man I ever knew...

58:33.344 --> 58:34.606
bullshit!

58:34.645 --> 58:35.907
Stay the hell away from me,

58:35.946 --> 58:38.244
and stay away from them kids!

58:45.656 --> 58:47.214
Shit.

59:01.572 --> 59:05.167
You're letting me wear
these pearls?

59:05.209 --> 59:06.471
Your pearls.

59:46.083 --> 59:48.916
Just stay calm.

59:48.953 --> 59:51.581
He's going to try his best
to get a rise out of you

59:51.622 --> 59:53.613
any way he can.

59:53.658 --> 59:56.593
That will only work
to his advantage.

01:00:00.298 --> 01:00:01.959
Who's that?

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:04.500
Khaila.

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:07.731
So...

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:09.262
don't worry about it.

01:00:09.307 --> 01:00:11.502
Just... stay with it, okay?

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:15.109
All right?

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.618
And how long have you
been clean, Miss Richards?

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:29.858
Two years and one month.

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:31.555
And what made you stop?

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:39.994
Isaiah.

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:42.129
Could you please speak up,
Miss Richards?

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.268
Isaiah.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.709
What about Isaiah?

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.480
How I left him.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:56.042
Left him where, Miss Richards?

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:04.960
I just needed to get me a hit...
so bad.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.134
He was crying.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:15.605
He was screaming.

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:18.039
Like he was calling my name.

01:01:20.011 --> 01:01:22.411
And that's what made you stop?

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.144
Yes.

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.752
I wanted to hear my baby.

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:34.053
I didn't want no drugs
taking me out of my head.

01:01:35.226 --> 01:01:40.289
I wanted to fe...
feel that pain.

01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:44.893
I didn't want nothing
to ease that for me.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.010
Do you have a higher power,
Miss Richards?

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.101
Objection!

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.114
Relevance?

01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:58.308
I'll allow it.

01:01:58.349 --> 01:02:00.010
Please answer

01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:01.450
the question.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:03.476
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:08.252
It's because of Him
that I'm here today.

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.556
Could you explain
what you mean, please?

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:17.431
Because...
it's because of Him...

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:22.064
that I have this second chance
to make it up to Isaiah.

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:25.075
- Oh, shit!
- Mama, I'm thirsty!

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:26.701
- Watch it.
- Wait-wait-wait, oh, okay.

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:29.542
There's broken glass everywhere.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.207
I want apple juice.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.806
I don't have apple,
I just have orange.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.818
- I told him that this morning.
- Can I have apple juice?

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.786
- I can get you some lemonade.
- I want apple juice.

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:38.652
Sit down, Isaiah,
you're going to fall.

01:02:38.689 --> 01:02:40.816
- I want apple juice!
- I don't have apple.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:41.984
I want apple juice!

01:02:42.026 --> 01:02:43.220
- Sit down!
- I want apple...

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.957
Sit down! Sit down! Sit down!

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.724
I'm going for apple juice.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.463
Hannah, don't go near this.
I'll be right back.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:55.597
Sweetie, it's okay.

01:03:04.415 --> 01:03:05.882
She's a crack addict

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:08.680
who left her newborn baby
in a garbage heap

01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:11.244
in the dead of winter,
and that damn lawyer

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.279
makes her look
like Mother Teresa.

01:03:13.324 --> 01:03:14.552
Shh.

01:03:14.592 --> 01:03:16.924
Higher powers!

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:19.953
Tell me he was
calling her name.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:23.898
He was screaming from all
the crack she pumped into him!

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:27.893
Charlie, how can they think
about giving him back to her?

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:29.269
They're not going to.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.137
I mean, she's
not a mother.

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:32.972
She doesn't even know how
to take care of him.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.535
I mean, what,
what if he got sick?

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:37.877
What if he got hurt
or something?

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.906
She wouldn't know
what to do.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.617
I'm just so afraid we're
going to lose him.

01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:46.714
- What if we lose him?
- We're not going to lose him.

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:49.089
- I couldn't bear to lose him.
- We're not going to lose him.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.559
No, but what if we do?

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:53.654
Margaret, we're not,
we're not going to lose him.

01:03:58.102 --> 01:04:01.299
Charlie, did you see
how beautiful she was?

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:05.069
She was so beautiful.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.344
I was never no prostitute.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.473
You never took money for sex?

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.176
That was for drugs.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.913
Well, that makes it okay, then.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:16.920
Objection.

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:18.478
Sustained.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.990
Who's Isaiah's father?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.351
I don't know.

01:04:25.396 --> 01:04:28.957
So I assume that he won't be
helping you with child care.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:31.466
Who will you turn to, Khaila?

01:04:31.502 --> 01:04:32.969
Is there any kind

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:34.095
of support system

01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:37.301
that you can depend on
to help you with Isaiah?

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:41.368
My counselor, Gussie Chestnut,

01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:43.846
my sponsor,

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.610
my friends.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.183
These people
you've just mentioned,

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:51.279
aren't they all reformed
drug addicts themselves?

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:54.883
They all been clean
for at least five years.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:57.894
Just answer the question,
please, yes or no?

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:00.864
Yes.

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:02.160
Couldn't they relapse

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:03.723
at any time?

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:05.632
I mean, there's no
real assurance

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:06.636
that you yourself

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.262
won't relapse,
is there?

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:09.829
That's not going to happen.

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:13.775
"That's not going to happen."

01:05:13.811 --> 01:05:15.142
The pledge

01:05:15.179 --> 01:05:17.010
of a drug-addicted prostitute.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:23.185
Seizures, inter-cranial bleeds,
malformed kidneys.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.279
And all these can be
the result of drug use

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:26.846
while the child is in utero?

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.825
Yes, and they're almost always
low-birth-weight babies,

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.829
frequently premature,
higher incidence of crib death.

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:34.592
And later?

01:05:34.632 --> 01:05:37.328
They're usually
highly irritable.

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.529
Some have severe
learning disabilities,

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.767
moodiness, poor coordination.

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:46.401
Stress usually aggravates
these symptoms.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:50.937
Can anything be done
to alleviate these problems?

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.312
We don't know for sure,

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.977
but calm, steady,
dependable parenting

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:56.849
is certainly in the
child's best interest.

01:05:56.887 --> 01:05:59.549
The kind he's receiving
from the Lewins.

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.455
I would say so.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:13.798
Amir?

01:06:21.779 --> 01:06:23.770
You going to let me in?

01:06:33.924 --> 01:06:35.824
Hey.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.886
Why are you here?

01:06:40.798 --> 01:06:42.629
Came to see you.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.794
That ain't no reason.

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:48.964
Yes, it is.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.975
And I brought you something.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:54.068
That's his.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.611
Yeah...

01:06:57.648 --> 01:06:59.616
but I brought it for you.

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:00.742
Hey, boy,

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:04.117
who you talking to?

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:06.122
Well, well, well, if it ain't

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:07.783
Miss High-and-Mighty.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:10.293
The rent gone way up,
all right?

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:12.921
Now, wait, wait,
hold on, wait up.

01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:15.193
What, what, what, what you think
I should charge her?

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:17.860
What you think
I should charge her, huh?

01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:19.766
Something high, right?

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:20.770
$200?

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:22.169
- $250!
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:24.834
- $250.
- Make it $300.

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:27.706
You staying?

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:34.950
No, baby, I can't stay,

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:36.542
but I know you want me to,

01:07:36.587 --> 01:07:38.214
but I can't.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:40.780
Hey, hey! You holding up
the program, now, boy.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:42.758
Come on, now,
and show your Uncle Tyrone

01:07:42.793 --> 01:07:44.590
that dance you done for me
last week.

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.220
Come on, now.

01:07:47.865 --> 01:07:50.493
Amir...

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:52.399
I know things
right now seem like

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:55.234
it don't make sense to you,
and you don't understand,

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:58.503
but I've been just where you are

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.703
and it ain't gonna be easy,

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.144
but it don't mean
you can't make it.

01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:07.442
Come on, boy, I'm waiting now.

01:08:14.892 --> 01:08:17.587
Come on, boy, do it.

01:08:21.799 --> 01:08:23.460
That's my boy.

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:29.372
Who combs his hair?

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:31.741
What?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.504
Who combs his hair?

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:34.908
Margaret.

01:08:36.913 --> 01:08:38.279
Uh... we all do.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.044
Who taught you how?

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.017
Or did you read that in a book?

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.014
Our black pediatrician.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.581
So you know
an African-American.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:52.527
One with a professional degree.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.688
Have you ever had
your black pediatrician

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.359
over to dinner, Mr. Lewin?

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.868
Do you have your pediatrician
over to dinner?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.897
Answer my question, yes or no?

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.201
No.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.439
When's the last time
you and your wife had dinner

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.880
with anyone of color, Mr. Lewin?

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:16.314
Please answer

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.048
the question, Mr. Lewin.

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.421
I'm sorry, I can't remember
the last time.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.657
You love your wife, Mr. Lewin?

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:31.566
Oh, yes, very much.

01:09:31.602 --> 01:09:32.660
How long you been married?

01:09:32.703 --> 01:09:34.568
14 years.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:35.935
And you love your daughter?

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:38.337
- Of course.
- So this is a nice,

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:41.435
stable environment to bring
Isaiah into, wouldn't you say?

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:42.911
Yes, I would say.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.810
Yes.

01:09:46.517 --> 01:09:48.417
Who's Suzanna Polaski,
Mr. Lewin?

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.947
Uh, she's an architect
who works in my office.

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:56.652
You having an affair
with Suzanna Polaski?

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:02.764
No.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.096
No?

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:07.467
Be careful, Mr. Lewin,
you're under oath.

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:10.337
I'm not having an affair.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:15.335
Have you ever had an affair
with Suzanna Polaski?

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:17.677
Yes or no?

01:10:24.488 --> 01:10:26.683
Yes.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.715
I spent one evening with her.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:54.909
I'm sorry.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:01.947
What exactly are you sorry for?

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:04.961
That you threw your baby
in the trash?

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:08.123
That you dragged my family
through hell?

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.191
No, I just want my son back.

01:11:12.236 --> 01:11:15.672
Your son?

01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:17.765
What makes him your son?

01:11:17.808 --> 01:11:19.969
That you fucked some junkie
in an alley

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:23.070
three years ago to get high?

01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:24.478
Well, if you were
all of that,

01:11:24.515 --> 01:11:26.745
your husband wouldn't have
fucked somebody else,

01:11:26.784 --> 01:11:28.649
and maybe you'd have
a baby of your own,

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.152
and you wouldn't be trying

01:11:30.187 --> 01:11:31.176
to take mine.

01:11:31.221 --> 01:11:32.654
Look in the mirror.

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:33.815
Look at my face.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:34.983
I'm his mother.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:35.992
God says so.

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:36.993
Take yours?

01:11:37.027 --> 01:11:38.995
I didn't have to take him.

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:40.656
You threw him away, remember?

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:43.222
Any animal can give birth.

01:11:43.267 --> 01:11:45.394
That doesn't make it a mother.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:47.665
Oh, so you calling me an animal?

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.001
If you think

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.529
you just gonna walk
up in this court

01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:51.700
and take my baby

01:11:51.742 --> 01:11:53.539
like you take some
puppy from a pound,

01:11:53.577 --> 01:11:55.704
you got another
thing coming, lady,

01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:58.715
'cause you ain't gonna
take my baby from me.

01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:01.445
He's not a baby.

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:02.543
You don't even know him.

01:12:02.586 --> 01:12:04.053
You don't know
anything about him.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.452
Wait!

01:12:05.489 --> 01:12:07.582
Don't do this.

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:10.092
Don't do this to Isaiah.

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:13.357
Don't do what?

01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:14.523
Tell him the truth...

01:12:14.565 --> 01:12:17.659
that his real mama is as black
as he is?

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.191
Black?

01:12:19.236 --> 01:12:21.568
All you people
think about is color.

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:22.970
You people?

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.633
You people?

01:12:24.675 --> 01:12:29.135
Well, me and Isaiah...
we the same kind of people...

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:32.546
or didn't you notice?

01:12:50.634 --> 01:12:52.602
Margaret?

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:55.366
I'm not going to talk
about this right now.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:27.734
Hi, honey.

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:29.762
Hi, Mom.

01:13:32.009 --> 01:13:33.169
Mom?

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:35.838
Hmm?

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.904
Are they going to take Isaiah?

01:13:37.948 --> 01:13:40.246
Are you going to be okay?

01:13:40.284 --> 01:13:42.252
Oh, honey.

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:49.885
I love you, Mommy.

01:13:49.927 --> 01:13:52.293
Oh, Hannah, Hannah,

01:13:52.329 --> 01:13:54.422
Hannah, Hannah.

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:57.126
There's never been
anybody like you.

01:14:48.018 --> 01:14:49.610
Is this policy

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:51.814
unique to your agency?

01:14:51.855 --> 01:14:52.981
No.

01:14:53.023 --> 01:14:55.355
Most if not all
agencies prefer

01:14:55.392 --> 01:14:59.522
to place a child with a family
of the same racial background.

01:14:59.563 --> 01:15:01.531
Hmm.

01:15:01.565 --> 01:15:04.932
Given the facts in this case
as you understand them,

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:07.937
what would be
your recommendation?

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:10.872
That the child
should be returned

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:12.067
to his birth mother.

01:15:12.109 --> 01:15:14.168
Thank you.

01:15:14.211 --> 01:15:16.202
No further questions.

01:15:19.516 --> 01:15:20.949
Dr. Goldfein, you've stated

01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:22.952
that your organization
is opposed

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:24.851
to interracial adoptions.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:26.947
Does that mean you never
place black infants

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.924
with white couples?

01:15:28.959 --> 01:15:32.952
Oh, no. We do this all the time,
but these are temporary.

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:36.261
These children stay temporarily
in the white home

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:39.063
until a suitable black family
comes along?

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:40.262
That's right.

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:41.702
How long does that take?

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:43.706
It can take years.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.173
And the child is then

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:49.372
wrenched from the only family
they've ever known...

01:15:49.413 --> 01:15:53.975
and turned over to strangers
because of the color

01:15:54.051 --> 01:15:55.541
of their skin?

01:15:55.585 --> 01:15:58.918
It's the long-term
interest of the child

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.718
we are trying to protect.

01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:01.883
Well, wouldn't
you say

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.825
you were putting
political policy

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.522
above the emotional
health of these children?

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:07.928
No.

01:16:07.964 --> 01:16:09.932
All things being equal,

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:12.935
the black child is better off
with black parents.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:15.027
All things being equal.

01:16:15.072 --> 01:16:17.199
Well, what if all things
are not equal?

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.506
Miss Jones, I am sick and tired

01:16:21.545 --> 01:16:23.274
of the attitude that says

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:25.440
that taking poor
black children out

01:16:25.482 --> 01:16:27.677
of their environment
and placing them

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:29.207
in an affluent household

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:32.278
is better for the child.

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:35.314
What kind of values
does that suggest?

01:16:37.394 --> 01:16:39.624
- How much time do you got?
- Not much.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:40.789
How about lunch?

01:16:40.831 --> 01:16:41.957
No.

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:43.226
Look, no strings
or nothing.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:44.358
Would you leave me alone?

01:16:44.401 --> 01:16:45.663
I can't give them nothing

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:48.068
to use against me in there,
or I'll lose my boy.

01:16:48.105 --> 01:16:49.265
I don't want to do nothing

01:16:49.306 --> 01:16:50.568
to hurt your chances.

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:52.131
Why didn't you
answer my letters?

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:54.234
'Cause I didn't open them.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:55.972
I cannot talk to you.

01:16:56.012 --> 01:16:58.003
I want you to know something.

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:00.607
I filed for a divorce...

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.414
and I'm coming back
when I get it.

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:08.785
Okay, I just wanted to say that.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.355
You said it.

01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:18.797
Mrs. Lewin,

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.029
does Isaiah play with dolls?

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:21.196
Sometimes.

01:17:21.238 --> 01:17:23.331
Any of them black?

01:17:24.975 --> 01:17:26.442
Yes.

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:29.673
And some of them are green,
and some of them are purple,

01:17:29.713 --> 01:17:30.771
and some of them are orange.

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:31.781
It doesn't seem

01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:32.782
to matter to him.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:33.942
He plays with all of them.

01:17:33.984 --> 01:17:35.144
As you know, Mrs. Lewin,

01:17:35.185 --> 01:17:38.882
people don't have green
or purple or orange faces.

01:17:41.892 --> 01:17:43.860
When you and Isaiah read
together,

01:17:43.894 --> 01:17:46.954
do any of the books you read
have African-American characters

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:49.522
or pertain to African-American
history or culture?

01:17:49.566 --> 01:17:53.593
We read Isaiah all sorts
of books in our home.

01:17:53.637 --> 01:17:55.605
Oh, I'm sure you do,

01:17:55.639 --> 01:17:58.802
but is there a black face
in any of them?

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.673
For instance,

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.439
have you read
<i>The Planet of Junior Brown,</i>

01:18:02.479 --> 01:18:03.503
or <i>The People Could Fly,</i>

01:18:03.547 --> 01:18:05.344
or <i>Many Thousand Gone</i>
by Virginia Hamilton?

01:18:05.382 --> 01:18:06.747
Not yet.

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:08.910
Well, how about <i>The Red</i>
<i>Dancing Shoes</i> by Denise Patrick

01:18:09.019 --> 01:18:11.180
or Faith Ringgold's <i>Aunt</i>
<i>Harriet's Underground Railroad</i>

01:18:11.221 --> 01:18:12.483
<i>in the Sky?</i>

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.682
Not yet.

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:16.817
Or maybe your husband
has read him <i>Fathers and Sons,</i>

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.920
or <i>Uncle Jed's Barbershop</i>
by Margeree King Mitchell.

01:18:19.963 --> 01:18:21.954
No, I don't think so.

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:27.333
Well, who do you think
he identifies with, Mrs. Lewin?

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:30.237
The orange-faced muppet?

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:33.470
Does he share
its muppet history?

01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:36.411
You ever stop to think
how Isaiah must feel

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:37.606
living in a world

01:18:37.647 --> 01:18:40.343
where he never sees
anyone like himself?

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:43.944
Might be kind of troubling,
don't you think?

01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:46.319
Well, what's your point,
Mr. Lewis?

01:18:46.356 --> 01:18:49.450
That our skin isn't
the right color?

01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:53.952
That we're incapable
of teaching this child

01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.965
what he needs to learn?

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:59.457
That I can't raise Isaiah up
to be an honorable man

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:01.527
because my skin is white?

01:19:05.609 --> 01:19:07.577
What about love?

01:19:09.379 --> 01:19:12.610
You haven't even spoken
that word here.

01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:14.776
Or doesn't that fit
into your equation

01:19:14.818 --> 01:19:17.184
of black and white?

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.484
And what about Isaiah?

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:22.685
How does he fit
into all of this?

01:19:22.726 --> 01:19:25.718
Or is it more important
that we be

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:27.957
politically correct?

01:19:39.476 --> 01:19:42.377
What we should be thinking
about here...

01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:47.116
is what is going to happen...

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:50.085
to the spirit
of this little boy...

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:55.583
if he's...

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:58.287
taken away from us.

01:19:58.328 --> 01:20:00.387
So, what you're saying is,

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:03.228
you're his only hope.

01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:07.637
What I'm saying is,

01:20:07.671 --> 01:20:10.196
we are all he knows,

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.108
and if you take him away
from us, it'll kill him.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:17.603
Oh.

01:20:19.616 --> 01:20:22.244
So only you can save him.

01:20:24.254 --> 01:20:26.279
You're the great white hope.

01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:30.717
No.

01:20:32.729 --> 01:20:35.197
But I am his mother.

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:38.496
Are you?

01:21:15.505 --> 01:21:17.700
Shit.

01:21:36.359 --> 01:21:38.486
Thank you.

01:21:39.529 --> 01:21:41.861
You're welcome.

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:12.921
Higher, higher up. Faster.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:16.227
Vroom, vroom!

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.960
- Vroom!
- I'm going to tickle you.

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:19.398
I'm going to tickle you!

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:22.370
BI-bl-bl-bleah!

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.770
Make it go really high.

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:26.274
Mom, is that you?

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:27.969
Hi, honey.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:30.240
Mommy, Mommy!

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:31.769
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:32.781
Mommy!

01:22:32.815 --> 01:22:35.579
Oh... there's my boy!

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:37.711
There's my boy.

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:40.221
Oh, little boy-o.

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:43.987
Mmm...

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.390
Mommy!

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:47.156
See you later, Mom.

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:51.927
Gonna tickle you!

01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:55.060
Gotcha.

01:23:08.918 --> 01:23:10.215
Hello?

01:23:10.252 --> 01:23:11.947
Khaila, the judge has asked us

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:13.419
to be at the court at 11:00.

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:15.320
Okay. Bye.

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:30.338
All rise.

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.966
This branch of the Circuit Court
of Cook County

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:34.133
is now in session,

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:36.576
the Honorable Renata Silbowitz
presiding.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:37.601
Be seated.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:45.250
This was not an easy decision.

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:49.950
I have decided to return
the child, Isaiah,

01:23:49.992 --> 01:23:51.857
to his biological mother.

01:23:51.894 --> 01:23:53.987
When the mother is capable...

01:23:54.063 --> 01:23:58.124
and I believe Miss Richards
is functioning well enough

01:23:58.167 --> 01:23:59.862
to parent this child...

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:02.302
it is usually
in the child's best interest

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:04.101
to be with his natural mother,

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:08.269
especially when there
is a racial issue involved.

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:11.711
This may cause
some initial trauma,

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:13.146
but Isaiah is young...

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:14.547
We're just going
to take him away.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.210
...and should be able
to deal with this...

01:24:16.252 --> 01:24:17.651
Out of the state,
out of the country.

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:19.677
...if the adults conduct
themselves thoughtfully.

01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:22.555
- No.
- Oh, why not?

01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:25.219
Our jobs can move.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:26.819
We'll go to California.

01:24:26.862 --> 01:24:28.762
You always wanted
to go there.

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.890
No, Charles.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.866
Well, we're going
to appeal.

01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:37.338
No!

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.143
It's over!

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.932
What you doing?

01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:16.944
I said, "Nothing."

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:19.209
You a dinosaur?

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:20.875
I'm coming.

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.907
What you doing?

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:23.941
Nothing.

01:25:24.053 --> 01:25:26.214
Isaiah?

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:28.052
Come on, honey, it's time to go.

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.526
Let's get your jacket on, okay?

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.360
You're going to see
Khaila now... remember?

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:37.865
I told you about her.

01:25:40.703 --> 01:25:43.763
You're going to live
with her, Isaiah.

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:45.967
And then I'm coming back.

01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.908
No, honey, you're
not coming back.

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:49.308
I coming back.

01:25:49.345 --> 01:25:50.812
No, Isaiah, wait, wait!

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:52.143
Wait a minute.

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:03.786
Here.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:05.726
Look.

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:07.956
This is Mama's.

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:12.925
I want you to keep it, okay?

01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:14.833
No matter what happens.

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:19.830
I want you to know that
we're always together...

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:22.673
that I'm always with you...

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:25.077
inside you, in here...

01:26:25.114 --> 01:26:29.073
just like you're
always with me...

01:26:29.118 --> 01:26:31.951
in here, all right?

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:34.114
And nobody...

01:26:35.991 --> 01:26:39.358
can ever change that.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:47.131
You promise you won't forget?

01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:03.917
Hey, kiddo.

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:06.817
Hannah?

01:27:09.358 --> 01:27:10.188
Kiddo?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.386
Isaiah.

01:27:12.428 --> 01:27:13.486
Isaiah, this is the lady

01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:15.759
that's going to take you
to Khaila's house, okay?

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:17.493
Hi, Isaiah, you want
to come with me?

01:27:17.533 --> 01:27:19.194
It's going to be all right,
Isaiah.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:20.599
Let me just take
him, all right?

01:27:20.636 --> 01:27:21.796
I swear it'll be all right.

01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:23.566
- It's going to be all right.
- No.

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:24.902
Why don't you just
let me take him?

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.737
It'll be better,
and you'll get used to it.

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:29.335
Why don't you just let me
take him, Mrs. Lewin, okay?

01:27:29.378 --> 01:27:30.709
I promise you
it'll be all right.

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:31.713
- Let me just take him.
- No!

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:33.510
Mr. Lewin, this isn't helping.

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:34.641
And you are?!

01:27:34.683 --> 01:27:36.207
Let me have him.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.310
- Just a minute.
- Mommy!

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:40.844
Just a minute!
Just a minute!

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:42.049
Just a minute!

01:27:42.091 --> 01:27:44.582
Well, what about his things?

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.116
They're not his things now.

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:50.257
Tell her he has to have
a light on to sleep.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:26.260
Hi, Isaiah.

01:29:26.295 --> 01:29:29.696
You scared? Don't be scared.

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:33.929
I'm your mama...
and I ain't gonna hurt you.

01:29:34.036 --> 01:29:37.267
I know what it's like
to be scared.

01:29:37.306 --> 01:29:41.106
That's why I'm gonna give you
all the time you need.

01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:43.077
All the time in the world.

01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:46.205
This is where
you gonna live, you and me.

01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:50.878
I fixed this whole place up
just for you.

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:53.786
And your toys that
you brought with you

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:55.983
are right over there in a box.

01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:01.486
That your boy?

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:04.624
Yeah.

01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:06.634
What's his name?

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:11.568
Isaiah.

01:30:11.607 --> 01:30:13.268
Hey, Isaiah.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.480
He's deaf.

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:22.983
Nah, he ain't deaf.

01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:25.713
Just a little tired right now.

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:27.483
Come back tomorrow.

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:30.320
He'll play with you then.

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:33.759
Something's wrong with him.

01:30:47.476 --> 01:30:49.944
Hi. Who's this?

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:51.275
Isaiah.

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:52.507
Oh, hi.

01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:00.648
You know where class 3B is?

01:31:00.689 --> 01:31:02.213
I think...
Do you know where 3B is?

01:31:02.257 --> 01:31:04.191
Up the stairs and to your left.

01:31:04.226 --> 01:31:06.057
So, you're new here, huh?

01:31:06.094 --> 01:31:07.356
Yep. First day.

01:31:07.396 --> 01:31:09.057
Welcome.

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:18.562
Come on, sweetie,
don't be slow.

01:31:18.607 --> 01:31:19.733
Come on.

01:31:22.878 --> 01:31:26.370
Everyone pick up a piece
of paper when you come in.

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.217
Okay, I got to go to work,

01:31:35.257 --> 01:31:36.952
so I'm gonna leave
you here, okay?

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:39.620
Now, all these kids here,
you can play with them...

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.492
and have fun, okay?

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:44.363
I'll be back
to get you later.

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:45.889
Go on and play.

01:31:47.436 --> 01:31:49.461
Bye-bye.

01:32:07.556 --> 01:32:09.786
Leave it there.

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.624
Okay.

01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:26.131
Yeah, let's just
leave everything

01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:28.233
exactly the way it
is, shall we?

01:32:29.611 --> 01:32:33.138
You can just sit right
there, and I'll, uh...

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:35.911
I'll sit...

01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:39.079
right here.

01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:41.453
And Hannah can lock herself
in her room,

01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:44.516
and we don't ever have
to talk to her again, do we?

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:46.720
Remember her? Hannah?
Your daughter!?

01:32:46.762 --> 01:32:48.161
Let go of me.

01:32:48.196 --> 01:32:49.959
I'm not going to,
Margaret. I can't.

01:32:49.998 --> 01:32:53.297
- Get out of my way!
- Margaret,

01:32:53.335 --> 01:32:54.927
what happened here
is as bad as it gets,

01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:55.994
but you got to get over it.

01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:58.572
"Get over it"?

01:32:58.607 --> 01:32:59.767
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:59.808 --> 01:33:00.900
Oh, I forgot, we're supposed

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:02.170
to feel sorry
for poor Margaret

01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:03.700
because she lives
in an unjust world,

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:05.508
and she's just going
to have to live there.

01:33:05.547 --> 01:33:06.571
Hmm? What's the matter?

01:33:06.615 --> 01:33:08.412
Can't you fix
this one, Maggie?

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.815
You son of a bitch!

01:33:12.854 --> 01:33:17.484
No! No! No, no!

01:33:17.526 --> 01:33:22.896
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:24.228
Margaret,

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.564
Margaret, maybe he's better off
where he is.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.832
Maybe, just maybe,
that lawyer was right.

01:33:32.374 --> 01:33:34.501
I know he isn't ours.

01:33:34.543 --> 01:33:35.942
I just...

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:40.914
didn't know
I'd miss him this much.

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:48.851
Neither did I.

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:55.161
I didn't know.

01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:06.866
Thought you might
like to read to him.

01:34:06.908 --> 01:34:10.901
He don't even talk to me.

01:34:11.947 --> 01:34:14.142
It's only been two weeks.

01:34:14.182 --> 01:34:18.278
It's a tough thing for a child
to understand all at once.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.617
He'll come around.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:22.145
And if he don't?

01:34:23.859 --> 01:34:26.555
It happened to me.

01:34:26.595 --> 01:34:29.758
I remember I used to sit
under a chair

01:34:29.798 --> 01:34:33.097
when they used
to come try to get me...

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:35.932
take me from one
foster place to another.

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:40.837
I know what it's like...

01:34:40.876 --> 01:34:44.073
to want to get
inside yourself...

01:34:44.112 --> 01:34:47.570
and just disappear.

01:34:47.616 --> 01:34:50.084
But you didn't.

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:56.486
Okay, got you a hamburger
and some French fries.

01:34:56.525 --> 01:34:58.823
Look, they gave you
a car. Look.

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:01.420
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

01:35:03.465 --> 01:35:04.762
Okay. Want a French fry?

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.767
Here, try a French fry.
Go ahead.

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:07.927
Okay, wait a minute.

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:09.901
Here, here, try another one.

01:35:09.938 --> 01:35:11.599
Come on, it's good.

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.766
Come on, Isaiah, please?

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:13.933
Come on, look,

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:15.566
now you going to have
to eat something,

01:35:15.610 --> 01:35:17.601
'cause if you don't eat,
you're going to get sick.

01:35:17.646 --> 01:35:19.170
Now, look-look at Mama,
I'm gonna eat.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:21.546
Mmm, good. Good.

01:35:21.583 --> 01:35:23.210
Come on, try your hamburger.

01:35:23.251 --> 01:35:24.616
- Isaiah.
- No. No.

01:35:24.653 --> 01:35:26.518
Take a bite of your hamburger.

01:35:26.555 --> 01:35:27.954
- No. No!
- Come on, please?

01:35:27.989 --> 01:35:28.956
- Isaiah.
- No, go away!

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:29.957
Isaiah!

01:35:29.991 --> 01:35:31.219
Please, come on, turn around.

01:35:31.259 --> 01:35:32.487
- No, no, no, no.
- Eat the hamburger.

01:35:32.527 --> 01:35:33.459
Come on, please?

01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:34.962
Isaiah, eat the...

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:36.121
Ouch!

01:35:36.164 --> 01:35:38.632
I want my mommy!

01:35:38.667 --> 01:35:39.964
Isaiah! Isaiah, no!

01:35:40.035 --> 01:35:41.127
I want my mommy!

01:35:41.169 --> 01:35:42.500
Isaiah, not the chair.
No, Isaiah!

01:35:42.537 --> 01:35:43.799
Please, Isaiah, come here.

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:45.032
Isaiah, no!

01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:51.137
Oh, don't do this.

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:52.976
Don't do this.

01:35:53.014 --> 01:35:56.313
No. Don't do this.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:06.587
Isaiah.

01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:08.119
Isaiah?

01:36:09.131 --> 01:36:13.591
Isaiah! Isaiah!

01:36:13.636 --> 01:36:15.763
Stop playing games!

01:36:15.804 --> 01:36:16.930
Isaiah!

01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:17.939
Shit.

01:36:17.973 --> 01:36:21.773
Isaiah! Isaiah!

01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:23.778
Isaiah!

01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:26.110
Shit. Isaiah!

01:36:26.148 --> 01:36:28.139
Isaiah!

01:36:29.485 --> 01:36:31.282
Isaiah!

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.289
Isaiah, are you in here?

01:36:34.323 --> 01:36:37.486
Isaiah! Isaiah!

01:36:42.998 --> 01:36:44.795
Isaiah!

01:36:58.847 --> 01:37:01.338
Okay.

01:38:00.175 --> 01:38:01.836
Hannah.

01:38:02.945 --> 01:38:04.913
Why do I always have
to get the phone?

01:38:04.947 --> 01:38:07.939
'Cause it's always for you.

01:38:12.621 --> 01:38:14.612
Hello.

01:38:16.458 --> 01:38:18.392
Mom.

01:38:56.064 --> 01:38:58.123
Thank you for coming.

01:38:58.167 --> 01:38:59.634
Is he all right?

01:38:59.668 --> 01:39:01.659
No.

01:39:07.643 --> 01:39:11.079
I guess I just wanted him so bad
that I wasn't thinking.

01:39:11.113 --> 01:39:13.172
Maybe I was just hoping.

01:39:15.484 --> 01:39:18.681
I wanted him to know who he was
and where he came from,

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.654
and that I never
would've given him up

01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:23.419
if I'd have been clean and
hadn't been all messed up,

01:39:23.459 --> 01:39:26.087
and that I was going to
always be there for him.

01:39:26.128 --> 01:39:28.596
And I want him to stay
in school, right here,

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.291
with these kids just like him.

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.063
Khaila, what are you talking
about?

01:39:34.102 --> 01:39:35.865
I want you to go in there,

01:39:35.904 --> 01:39:38.805
and hold him till he
ain't scared no more.

01:39:40.309 --> 01:39:42.607
I'm not saying I'm
giving him back to you.

01:39:42.644 --> 01:39:43.804
I'm just saying he's going

01:39:43.846 --> 01:39:45.677
to come live with you
for a little while

01:39:45.714 --> 01:39:47.238
till he can understand
all this.

01:39:47.282 --> 01:39:48.909
Now, some people
are going to think

01:39:48.951 --> 01:39:50.509
that I'm crazy,
but I don't care.

01:39:50.552 --> 01:39:52.110
All that matters
to me is Isaiah.

01:39:52.154 --> 01:39:53.621
And you may not like me,

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:55.384
but you're going to
have to deal with me.

01:39:55.424 --> 01:39:58.450
I'm doing this
because I love him.

01:39:58.494 --> 01:40:01.156
I really, really love him.

01:40:03.198 --> 01:40:05.962
I love him, too.

01:40:23.719 --> 01:40:26.085
Isaiah?

01:40:35.364 --> 01:40:38.663
- Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
- Oh, Isaiah!

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.361
Mommy! Mommy!

01:40:40.402 --> 01:40:41.664
Mommy!

01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:42.829
Oh, my boy!

01:40:42.871 --> 01:40:44.998
Oh, Isaiah!

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.507
Oh...

01:40:46.542 --> 01:40:49.204
Oh, I've missed you,
I've missed you.

01:40:50.212 --> 01:40:52.373
Mommy.

01:40:56.218 --> 01:40:57.685
Thank you.

01:41:05.494 --> 01:41:09.328
Isaiah, this is a nice
school you have here, hmm?

01:41:10.666 --> 01:41:13.328
Can you show me and Khaila
what you like to do?

01:41:14.336 --> 01:41:15.462
Huh?

01:41:15.504 --> 01:41:18.132
He likes to play with blocks.

01:41:18.173 --> 01:41:20.733
Do you want to play
with some blocks?

01:41:21.777 --> 01:41:23.642
Do you want to build something?

01:41:23.679 --> 01:41:26.307
Oh, look.
Khaila's got the blocks.

01:41:26.348 --> 01:41:28.339
Show me, Isaiah.

01:41:33.855 --> 01:41:36.653
Put that... oop...
put that big one there.

01:41:36.692 --> 01:41:38.990
A house?

01:41:39.027 --> 01:41:41.325
Is that a house?

01:41:41.363 --> 01:41:43.160
Which house
is Khaila's house?

01:41:43.198 --> 01:41:46.497
This one and this is yours.

01:41:46.535 --> 01:41:48.833
Isaiah's tower.

01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:51.168
You can have that room
at the very top, huh?

01:41:51.206 --> 01:41:54.175
All right.
