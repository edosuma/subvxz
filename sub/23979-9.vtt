00:01.040 --> 00:02.997
Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:03.040 --> 00:05.782
Wes: And I bumped into you.
Everything changed.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.582
I was supposed to marry Pippa.
Five days before I met you.

00:08.630 --> 00:10.587
You're not dying.
I'm cured.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.371
Stella: My cancer was gone

00:12.430 --> 00:14.171
and the eight years my family
spent taking care of me

00:14.220 --> 00:15.927
had kind of ruined
their lives.

00:15.970 --> 00:17.677
You're under arrest.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.091
You really did
get off easy.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.801
Easy?!

00:21.850 --> 00:24.478
I got a week in jail,
150 hours of community service,

00:24.520 --> 00:27.353
and I have to wear
a tracking anklet with a curfew.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.858
You have to stop
offering me rides

00:29.900 --> 00:31.811
and...amazing advice

00:31.860 --> 00:33.146
and -- and making me feel like

00:33.200 --> 00:34.736
you're the only person
on Earth

00:34.780 --> 00:36.817
who really gets me.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.697
Calluses are sexy.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.401
They're a sign of somebody
who's willing to do the work.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.748
You know I'm not here
'cause I wanna be, right?

00:43.790 --> 00:45.167
I'm aware.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.700
I got a job interview
in San Francisco.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.036
Pippa set it up.
Pippa?

00:48.090 --> 00:49.160
Yeah.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.541
She recommended me
for it.

00:50.590 --> 00:52.126
How am I supposed
to feel about this?

00:52.170 --> 00:53.376
I trusted you.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.468
_ Now
it's your turn to trust me.

00:55.510 --> 01:00.175
[ Layup's "Growing Pains"
plays ]

01:00.220 --> 01:02.632
Since Wes left
for San Francisco,

01:02.680 --> 01:04.262
I'd barely slept.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.392
Thank God he was coming home
this morning.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.262
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:09.320 --> 01:11.357
I, oh, I

01:11.400 --> 01:14.028
I got these growing pains

01:14.070 --> 01:18.985
When the storm wind blows,
I'm the weather vane

01:19.030 --> 01:20.691
I, oh, I

01:20.740 --> 01:23.448
I'm made from what remains

01:23.500 --> 01:28.165
Thick skin, knowing
it's just growing pains

01:31.880 --> 01:34.463
Only problem?
Wes was late.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.831
So I was late for work.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.226
Hi.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.056
Hi.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.937
Sorry.
The plane was delayed.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.813
San Francisco
has a lot of fog.

01:55.860 --> 01:57.350
Reminded me of London.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.152
I-I wanna
to hear everything.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.941
Like did you see Pippa?

02:00.990 --> 02:02.116
Oh, you've got to work,
right?

02:02.160 --> 02:03.480
I can just fill you in
later.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.746
Or you could just give me
the highlights.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.155
Like did you see Pippa?

02:06.210 --> 02:08.918
Actually, uh,
we probably should talk now.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.416
Oh, God.
You saw Pippa.

02:10.460 --> 02:13.703
I-I did not see Pippa.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.252
Oh, good.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.291
Though I-I wouldn't blame you
if you did.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.501
Talk to her, I mean.

02:18.550 --> 02:20.757
She did get you
the interview.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.290
I'm -- I'm sorry.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.591
I-I think I'm just feeling
really guilty about Seattle.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.631
Should we sit? Do you want
some tea? I made some tea.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.886
They offered me the job,
Stell.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.516
Oh.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.608
It's a really great job.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.312
I mean, I wouldn't
just be moving money around.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.273
I would actually be helping
real companies

02:39.320 --> 02:42.119
do real things to make
the world a better place.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.946
Wow.

02:43.990 --> 02:48.655
That sounds really...real.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.997
It is.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.202
And they need an answer
tomorrow.

02:53.250 --> 02:59.292
Wes, I-I don't know if I can
move to San Francisco right now.

02:59.340 --> 03:00.922
But we don't have to move.

03:00.970 --> 03:02.506
That's why it's perfect.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.712
Eventually,
I could work from here.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.421
But...currently?

03:06.470 --> 03:09.633
Well, you know,
for the first couple years,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.340
I'd probably have
to be there a lot.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.937
But, still,
I could come back on weekends.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.608
And you could come
when you can.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.311
The company said
that they'll pay for travel,

03:18.360 --> 03:20.988
and we'd rack up
frequent flyer miles,

03:21.030 --> 03:24.193
and we'd have enough
for a trip to Paris so soon.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.696
What do you think?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.321
I think...

03:31.830 --> 03:34.162
...you deserve it.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.166
Let's do it.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.166
Wait. Really?

03:36.210 --> 03:38.087
Absolutely. Yeah.

03:44.930 --> 03:46.341
Hey! You're late!

03:46.390 --> 03:48.461
I know. I'm so sorry.
Crazy morning.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.512
Wes' plane was delayed
and...

03:52.900 --> 03:54.095
You're gone.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.606
So, what do you need?

03:55.650 --> 03:57.311
Register help or --

03:57.360 --> 03:59.101
I need you to turn in
your end-of-the-month time card

03:59.150 --> 04:00.811
so I can pay you.
What do you mean?

04:00.860 --> 04:02.817
You know the words
I just said out loud?

04:02.860 --> 04:05.818
I mean those. Yeah, but the end
of the month isn't for another week.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.328
Yeah, well, time flies
when you're constantly tardy.

04:08.370 --> 04:10.532
Check the calendar.
-Wait.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.820
If it's the end of the month,

04:11.870 --> 04:14.168
I didn't pay any of my bills
and...

04:17.380 --> 04:19.291
Stella: I was late
for something else, too.

04:19.339 --> 04:20.875
Hey.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.548
I am so sorry for being late
today, but I have to go.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.046
But I-I'll be right back.

04:25.090 --> 04:28.469
You are the worst person
who's ever worked here!

04:29.810 --> 04:33.303
You're a close second.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.682
The funny thing
about a pregnancy test is,

04:35.730 --> 04:39.064
being pregnant
is always a positive...

04:39.110 --> 04:40.726
even though
the test has no idea

04:40.780 --> 04:42.236
how you'll actually feel
about it.

04:48.660 --> 04:51.652
Don't worry about a thing

04:51.700 --> 04:55.580
You'll learn to live again

04:55.620 --> 04:57.247
You're gonna learn
to live again

04:57.290 --> 05:02.080
Oh, oh, oh

05:05.430 --> 05:07.330
Oh. Hey.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.926
Do you mind
if I order from my sister?

05:08.970 --> 05:10.176
She knows
how I like my coffee.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.676
How does
she like her coffee?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.017
Free.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.516
Thanks!

05:14.560 --> 05:16.801
So, how was Wes' interview?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.852
Did he see Pippa?
How are you feeling?

05:18.900 --> 05:21.642
He got the job.
He did not see Pippa.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.237
And I'm feeling pregnant.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.897
What?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.907
Oh, my God!
You're pregnant?!

05:27.950 --> 05:29.577
Lizzie, you are at a 10.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.032
I'm gonna need you at a 2.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.570
How do you feel?

05:33.620 --> 05:36.328
Um...overwhelmed.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.952
Terrified.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.877
On a scale of 1 to,
"How can I do this right now?"

05:39.920 --> 05:42.127
I am solidly at, "How can
I do this right now?"

05:42.170 --> 05:43.456
I just got my life back,

05:43.510 --> 05:45.547
and Wes is taking this job
out of town,

05:45.590 --> 05:47.467
and all this stuff
with Dr. Grant and Pippa,

05:47.510 --> 05:49.421
we're not
exactly crushing it.

05:49.470 --> 05:50.881
And I know that
there is never a good time

05:50.930 --> 05:52.420
to have an "oops" baby,
but if there was,

05:52.470 --> 05:53.926
this is definitely not it.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.597
Okay.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.761
But I'm also
really excited.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.567
Lizzie, I really want
to be a mom,

06:01.610 --> 06:04.102
and I never thought
that I'd get the chance to.

06:04.150 --> 06:05.982
And Wes wants kids,
and we're married,

06:06.030 --> 06:07.816
so that might be fate,
you know?

06:07.860 --> 06:09.612
Then again, I can't even
take care of a cactus,

06:09.660 --> 06:11.150
and that requires
zero effort,

06:11.200 --> 06:12.577
so I am definitely gonna
forget to water the baby.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.826
Stella.

06:13.870 --> 06:14.940
Breathe.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.570
Come here.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.280
Congratulations.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.627
You're gonna be
a rock-star mom.

06:25.050 --> 06:27.712
I have repeatedly screwed up
taking care of your children.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.047
They survived,
and they adore you.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.751
You're gonna be amazing
at this.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.632
You really think so?

06:33.680 --> 06:35.091
I really do.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.556
Okay.
Okay.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.011
Well, I am choosing
to believe you

06:40.060 --> 06:41.858
because,
out of everyone I know,

06:41.900 --> 06:44.221
you are the one person who is
always 100% straight with me.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.772
Mm. Oh, but can
you not tell anyone?

06:45.820 --> 06:47.527
I'm still figuring out
how to tell Wes,

06:47.570 --> 06:49.732
and I-I'm so nervous.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.487
He's gonna be thrilled.

06:51.530 --> 06:54.989
Hey, you got this, sis.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.439
Oh, and before I go,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.116
Aiden wanted me to get
two of his favorite coffees.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.912
I assume, by "favorite,”
you mean "free."

06:59.960 --> 07:02.201
Totally.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.958
The dog park is full
of people looking to get laid.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.583
Basically, it's like going
to a bar during the daytime

07:07.630 --> 07:10.839
with no alcohol and a wingman
who pees on your foot.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.291
I've been that wingman.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.551
Hey, um, thanks again
for the coffee.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.635
What do I owe you?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.227
Nah, it's cool.

07:18.270 --> 07:20.307
I don't mind throwing money
around for the big boss.

07:20.350 --> 07:22.978
Aw, you were doing so well
before you said the word "big."

07:23.020 --> 07:24.431
But big is a good thing.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.436
Just quit while you're ahead.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.686
Am I ahead?

07:26.730 --> 07:29.734
It's unclear.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.817
Anyway...time to work.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.659
What do you mean?
I got here like an hour early.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.077
That's how long
we've been talking.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.997
We've been talking
for an hour?

07:41.040 --> 07:43.748
Whoa, I've never talked
to a chick for an hour before.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.201
I mean a girl.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.331
Lady?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.291
I prefer "broad."”
Really?

07:48.340 --> 07:50.251
Absolutely not.

07:54.930 --> 07:57.752
Hey, do you mind if I put the
floor cleaner on a high shelf?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.268
We don't want toxic chemicals
at the kids' snacking height.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.688
I truly do not care
where you put anything.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.051
Diego, do you know
where Fiona's pink elephant is?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.147
She wants to take it to school,
and I can't seem to --

08:07.190 --> 08:08.897
Does no one see
that I'm trying to work here?

08:08.940 --> 08:10.351
Oh, excuse us.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.107
We were just trying to take care
of your children.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.027
I'm sorry.

08:14.070 --> 08:17.028
Look, I do appreciate that.
I'm just trying to focus.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.946
There's this new territory
up for grabs at work,

08:18.990 --> 08:20.287
and I really want it.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.866
I thought you were close
with your boss.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.880
Yeah, he transferred, and
my new boss is not yet a fan.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.287
So I still got
to win her over.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.411
You should have Ida
make her brunch.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.871
That is a great idea.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.719
We can kill her
with kindness and carbs.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.830
You think that'll work?

08:34.890 --> 08:36.961
How do you think
I got tenure?

08:37.010 --> 08:38.307
Boom!

08:38.350 --> 08:40.557
Please don't ever
do that again.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.017
I was waiting
for the perfect moment

08:45.060 --> 08:47.188
to tell Wes about the baby.

08:47.230 --> 08:49.608
But this wasn't it.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.893
Why are
we driving through a cemetery?

08:52.950 --> 08:55.191
Because, this way,
we avoid Market Street,

08:55.240 --> 08:58.028
which cuts off two blocks
and a traffic light.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.821
Got it.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.747
So...

09:03.580 --> 09:05.491
...have you said yes
to the job yet?

09:05.540 --> 09:08.248
Are they excited?
Yeah, I can't wait to start.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.997
It's like
a whole new adventure.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.085
I'm pregnant.
What?!

09:28.020 --> 09:30.011
-Yeah, I'm fine.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.356
I just...

09:31.400 --> 09:34.188
feel bad
for Mr. Klapholz.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.026
How did this happen?
It doesn't say.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.368
It just says he was a husband,
father, and grandfather.

09:38.410 --> 09:39.946
No, I mean us.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.118
We've been careful.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.492
Yeah, we have.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.451
But...not always.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.707
And apparently not enough.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.832
How do you feel
about all this?

09:53.880 --> 09:57.839
I'm overjoyed, actually.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.336
You are?

09:59.390 --> 10:00.789
Yeah.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.342
I mean, this is
what we've wanted, right?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.682
I'm gonna be a dad.

10:06.730 --> 10:08.550
I'm gonna be a dad!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.975
You hear that,
Mr. Klapholz?!

10:12.020 --> 10:13.897
I'm gonna be a dad!

10:13.940 --> 10:15.681
And you're gonna be a mom.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.607
I'm so glad you understand
how parenthood works.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.152
We're gonna be parents!

10:22.740 --> 10:25.038
We were so happy
we were literally dancing

10:25.080 --> 10:26.070
on someone's grave.

10:27.410 --> 10:30.869
My grandfather
was a terrible person.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.371
Sorry for your loss.
sorry.

10:34.420 --> 10:37.162
Just like that, all the crap
with Dr. Grant and Pippa

10:37.220 --> 10:39.086
didn't matter anymore.

10:39.130 --> 10:40.586
It was just us now.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.460
Well, us and a baby.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.650
Yes?

11:01.700 --> 11:04.112
Question --

11:04.160 --> 11:06.071
Do you know how many women
I've slept with?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.615
Me neither.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.412
But every single one of them,

11:10.460 --> 11:12.371
I could tell you exactly
what they look like naked.

11:12.420 --> 11:13.740
Every detail.

11:13.790 --> 11:15.292
Grab me a piece of paper
and a number 2 pencil,

11:15.340 --> 11:17.661
and I can accurately sketch
them nude from memory.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.462
We all have gifts.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.046
But I couldn't tell you
if any one of them

11:21.090 --> 11:23.548
had jobs, hobbies,
feelings...

11:23.600 --> 11:25.557
Aiden, where are
you going with this?

11:25.600 --> 11:28.422
Kayla's different.
I actually like talking to her.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.767
I like listening to her.

11:30.810 --> 11:34.053
So, um,
what is the problem?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.896
Since I can't go out at night
or drink,

11:35.940 --> 11:37.567
my moves are out the window.

11:37.610 --> 11:40.318
Well, what do you know
about this girl?

11:40.360 --> 11:41.907
What does she like?
Uh...

11:41.950 --> 11:44.362
she has a ridiculously large
LEGO pirate-ship collection,

11:44.410 --> 11:45.946
which is totally weird,
but it's kind of cool

11:45.990 --> 11:47.537
that she'd admit that.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.117
Well, you need to find
something you both like...

11:50.160 --> 11:51.491
a common interest.

11:59.210 --> 12:01.372
Hey.
Kayla has a dog.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.171
You're not stealing
our neighbor's dog.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.757
I would never do that.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.677
But I would borrow it.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.728
Gina, thanks again
for coming over.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.511
Happy to.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.564
New in town, so my weekends
are pretty open at the moment.

12:16.610 --> 12:20.069
-I'd love a mimosa,

12:20.110 --> 12:21.987
<i>minus the 0.].</i>

12:22.030 --> 12:23.941
Ah, I like the way you think.
Make that two.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.731
I like the way you drink.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.657
Now, Gina, this is
my new experiment --

12:27.700 --> 12:29.407
gluten-free crusts.

12:29.450 --> 12:30.690
Try and see how...

12:30.750 --> 12:32.366
You know what?
Close your eyes.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.367
Oh, uh, Mom,

12:34.420 --> 12:36.991
I-I-I-I don't think
Gina wants to...

12:37.040 --> 12:39.372
Okay, fine.
Don't close your eyes.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.910
Because they are beautiful.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.758
-Oh, Lord.
-Thank you, Ida.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.541
You're the second person
that told me that this week.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.752
I think it's because
I started wearing contacts.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.508
Oh, I bet you looked adorable
in glasses, too.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.210
Nah. I didn't have
the face for it.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.635
Yeah, you do, girl.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.262
Oh, thanks, girl.

12:54.310 --> 12:56.187
Yeah, excuse me one moment.

12:56.230 --> 12:57.857
Diego,
where's the ladies' room?

12:57.900 --> 13:00.892
It is, uh, down the hall
and to the right.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.567
Okay.
Hey, while you're in there,

13:02.610 --> 13:04.237
look at your cheekbones
in the mirror.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.157
I'm telling you -- stunning.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.156
Oh.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.980
What the hell was that?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.906
The first step
to Diego's promotion.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.920
You are locked in, my friend,
because that lady digs me.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.281
Really? I mean, you --
you really think so?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.378
Yep.
My gay-dar is going off.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.740
Or is it my bi

13:20.800 --> 13:22.416
Either way,
that new territory

13:22.460 --> 13:24.121
is as good as yours,
D-dawg.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.252
For the record, I didn't sign
off on that nickname. No.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.007
You're welcome.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.428
Okay, what about Petunia?

13:30.470 --> 13:31.676
No.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.927
That sounds like
a grandma name.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.095
Arabella?

13:35.140 --> 13:36.301
No.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.091
Oh! Clementine.
No way!

13:38.150 --> 13:39.640
IICIemll
rhymes with "phlegm,"

13:39.690 --> 13:41.180
and all the kids
would call her "Phlegmentine.”

13:41.230 --> 13:43.528
You're demoted.
Veto power only.

13:43.570 --> 13:44.856
All right,
well, what if it's a boy?

13:44.900 --> 13:46.527
It's a girl.

13:46.570 --> 13:48.152
I wouldn't know
what to do with a boy.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.272
Except
buy him wee little knickers.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.788
Hey, just to be clear,
you don't sound like me.

13:53.830 --> 13:56.788
You sound like Mary Poppins
after a very subtle stroke.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.116
Hey, that is no way

13:58.170 --> 14:00.286
to talk
to the mother of your child.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.798
Do we want to know the gender?
Or wait and see?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.330
Ooh!
Ooh.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.792
Maybe we should do one
of those gender-reveal cakes

14:06.840 --> 14:08.922
where you cut it open
and it's either blue or pink.

14:08.970 --> 14:10.961
And, that way, if it's a boy,
I won't be sad,

14:11.010 --> 14:13.342
because it's impossible to be
disappointed when there's cake.

14:13.390 --> 14:15.677
What's that?

14:15.730 --> 14:17.630
OB-GYN appointment
is confirmed.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.260
Didn't even have to call.

14:19.310 --> 14:22.018
Wow. There's literally an app
for everything now.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.936
We're not gonna be those parents
that just put their kids

14:23.980 --> 14:25.607
in front of a screen
and forget about them, right?

14:25.650 --> 14:26.981
Right.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.600
Although I'm pretty sure
everyone says that

14:28.660 --> 14:30.867
before they have kids.
Hm.

14:30.910 --> 14:32.321
Oh, my God!

14:32.370 --> 14:33.326
Baby trainers.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.077
Aww!
Sorry. Sneakers.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.286
I cannot believe I was
so nervous to tell you.

14:38.330 --> 14:40.071
Thank you
for being so incredible.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.586
We're doing this.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.159
She was right.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.212
This place really is
like a singles' mixer.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.631
Hey, don't look at me
like that.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.421
- There's a lot
of single dogs here, too.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.932
I didn't know
you had a dog.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.267
I do. Love dogs.

15:02.310 --> 15:03.516
Especially mine.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.857
Though yours is cute, too.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.949
Got to say, I didn't peg you
as a tiny-dog person.

15:08.990 --> 15:11.311
Well, she thinks
she's a 150-pound mastiff.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.158
Hey.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.941
What's this guy's name?

15:14.990 --> 15:16.901
Bark.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.361
You named your dog Bark?

15:18.410 --> 15:21.038
Of course not.
Nobody names their dog Bark.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.536
It's just his first name.

15:22.580 --> 15:23.957
It's short for...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.879
Bark Zuckerberg.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.719
Ah,
That's clever.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.250
I like that.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.091
Stella:
How about Agatha?

15:35.140 --> 15:36.881
Wes: Oh, I love it.

15:36.930 --> 15:38.887
Yeah.
A proper British name.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.261
Could call her "Aggie"
for short.

15:40.310 --> 15:41.846
Mm.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.301
Hi, Stella. Wes.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.898
So, I rushed things a little,
and we got your blood results.

15:47.940 --> 15:50.819
The hCG levels in your blood
indicate that...

15:52.160 --> 15:53.776
...you're not pregnant.

15:53.820 --> 15:57.074
I'm not pregnant?

15:57.120 --> 15:58.531
I don't understand.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.366
She took a test.

16:00.410 --> 16:03.573
I mean, aren't those
supposed to be 99% accurate?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.997
Supposed to be,
but there are many things

16:06.040 --> 16:08.202
that could lead
to a false positive.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.719
One is ovarian cancer,

16:10.760 --> 16:12.376
SO we ran extra tests.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.251
I'd gotten bad news
in doctors' offices enough

16:18.310 --> 16:19.630
to know when to brace yourself

16:19.680 --> 16:21.762
so you don't spin
out of control.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.556
Is it back?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.011
It

16:26.060 --> 16:27.141
No.

16:27.190 --> 16:28.851
No,
you're completely healthy.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.777
Then why are
you looking at me like that?

16:30.820 --> 16:34.279
Like --
Like something's wrong?

16:34.320 --> 16:35.902
Is something wrong?

16:35.950 --> 16:40.114
Because of the treatment you
underwent when you were sick,

16:40.160 --> 16:41.491
your ovaries
aren't functioning

16:41.540 --> 16:43.781
as they should
in someone your age.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.377
Your egg count is very low.

16:45.420 --> 16:49.163
Are you telling me
I can't have kids?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.466
Are you saying
I can't have kids?

16:59.510 --> 17:01.512
We never say never.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.631
But we still have options,
right?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.808
I mean, um, harvesting eggs.
Or --

17:06.859 --> 17:09.682
Unfortunately, your egg count
is too low for that.

17:09.730 --> 17:12.188
If you want to have
biological children,

17:12.240 --> 17:14.310
your very best chance
is to try naturally

17:14.359 --> 17:16.271
dsS sSo0n as you can.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.527
It's not impossible.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.820
But your window is closing.

17:24.829 --> 17:27.070
Gina: You are an
incredible cook, Ida. Ida: Oh.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.030
You're gonna have to give me
that quiche recipe.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.546
Well, I could show you
how to make it.

17:30.590 --> 17:33.161
- We could do a little
cooking lesson. Perfect.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.713
Ooh. Maybe you can show me
around the farmers' market, too.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.387
Done-zo.

17:37.430 --> 17:40.138
Put your number in here.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.132
Well, this has been
so much fun.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.589
Uh, Gina,
I'll walk you to your car.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.801
Oh, I-I could take her.

17:47.850 --> 17:50.569
Mom!
Let him take it from here.

17:50.610 --> 17:52.396
So, listen, Gina,
I would --

17:52.440 --> 17:54.272
I would love to talk about the
new territory that opened up.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.947
Diego, I think we've both
earned our weekends.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.947
Let's save that talk
for the office, okay?

17:57.990 --> 17:59.116
But duly noted.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.480
Fiona: Dad!

18:00.530 --> 18:02.328
Grandpa took us
to see the airplanes!

18:02.370 --> 18:04.998
Oh, did he?
Oh, tell me all about it.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.326
Grandma!

18:07.790 --> 18:10.373
Attention spans of goldfish.
-Hey, guys.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.411
Hi. I'm Peter.
The ex-grandpa.

18:12.460 --> 18:15.168
Sorry. Current grandpa.
Ex-husband.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.587
- Gina.
Diego's new boss.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.291
So, you took them
to the airport?

18:19.340 --> 18:21.672
Actually, we were
at the Aviation Museum.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.882
They have a hangar --
Oh, with the B-24 exhibit.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.227
I've been wanting
to see that.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.385
That's the plane
that Joe Kennedy

18:26.430 --> 18:27.477
was flying when he died.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.932
Exactly.
Operation Aphrodite.

18:29.980 --> 18:31.470
You're a history buff, Gina?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.567
I am.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.931
I'm a history professor.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.233
Well, if you ever want
to go back...

18:37.280 --> 18:39.408
To tell you the truth,
the kids were more interested

18:39.450 --> 18:42.772
in the gift shop than
the actual displays. So...

18:42.830 --> 18:44.116
I'd love to.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.742
Great. Um...

18:45.790 --> 18:47.656
Why don't you put your number
in here?

18:47.710 --> 18:48.745
Ah,
And I'll give you a call.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.661
I'll be waiting.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.917
All right, then.
It was nice to meet you.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.007
I'll see you at work, Diego.

18:56.050 --> 18:57.415
Yeah.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.370
Wow.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.829
She is something.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.039
Yeah.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.716
Ida thought so, too.

19:07.560 --> 19:11.269
You're both gonna start
dating my boss, aren't you?

19:11.310 --> 19:13.688
How fun for me.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.436
Kayla:

19:16.480 --> 19:17.777
So, it's kinda nice

19:17.820 --> 19:19.697
to see you
without steel-toed boots on.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.560
Yeah. You too.

19:21.610 --> 19:23.578
It's cool that we have
something in common.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.019
Totally.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.946
So, we should do this again.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.152
Maybe at a planned time
with food or something?

19:30.210 --> 19:31.780
If we decided in advance

19:31.830 --> 19:35.164
to meet each other
at a predetermined location,

19:35.210 --> 19:36.666
wouldn't that
feel like a date?

19:36.710 --> 19:39.338
I was kinda hoping
it would be a date, yes.

19:39.380 --> 19:41.462
Yeah.

19:41.510 --> 19:42.796
Then no.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.002
No?

19:45.050 --> 19:47.428
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with "no."

19:47.470 --> 19:50.440
I don't date guys that game me
as a general rule.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.515
I'm not gaming you.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.346
You're not?
No.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.518
Come here, Bark!

20:00.400 --> 20:02.949
So?
He's not trained.

20:04.410 --> 20:05.821
Come here, Winston!

20:11.120 --> 20:12.747
How did you know his name?

20:12.790 --> 20:15.248
It's on his name tag,
doofus.

20:15.290 --> 20:18.544
Good boy.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.797
I'm really sorry.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.171
Hey, no.

20:22.220 --> 20:24.507
This isn't your fault.

20:24.550 --> 20:28.589
I know, but it doesn't
make it feel any less awful.

20:30.890 --> 20:34.144
You grabbed me,
and you held me

20:34.190 --> 20:37.603
And I just let my body hang

20:37.650 --> 20:39.721
I let you say
what you needed to say

20:39.780 --> 20:41.566
Should we try?

20:41.610 --> 20:44.318
Yeah, we should.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.317
Then I turned from you

20:46.370 --> 20:49.829
I want our little girl.

20:49.870 --> 20:52.703
It felt like we had her
for a second, and...

20:52.750 --> 20:55.879
I really liked that second.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.242
I really liked it, too.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.213
Okay. So...

21:02.260 --> 21:04.046
we do this?

21:04.090 --> 21:05.216
Yeah.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.342
I'll turn down
San Francisco.

21:07.390 --> 21:09.711
If we're gonna make this
happen, I need to be here.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.479
Are you sure?
That's a really great job.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.342
It is, but, you know,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.516
a job is
not the most important thing.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.108
I want to be a dad.

21:22.150 --> 21:26.155
So our family has to be
the priority right now.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.237
Okay?

21:28.280 --> 21:29.657
Okay.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.499
...and started my day

21:45.510 --> 21:50.425
Well, the job
is officially turned down.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.097
Let's make a baby.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.767
Not really that simple.

21:53.810 --> 21:57.348
I had no idea how much detail
went into baby making.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.107
Okay, so,
we have to change our diet,

21:59.150 --> 22:01.141
and you have to stop putting
your phone in your front pocket,

22:01.190 --> 22:02.601
and no more bike shorts.

22:02.650 --> 22:03.811
Which you don't even
ride a bike,

22:03.860 --> 22:05.180
so I think
it's a little silly

22:05.240 --> 22:06.196
that you wear them
in the first place.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.651
Okay.

22:07.700 --> 22:11.330
Consider me a kale-eating,
baggy-short-wearing guy

22:11.370 --> 22:13.236
who carries his phone
in his wife's purse.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.782
That is very sexy.
Mm.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.741
Wait till
I start rocking my dad bod.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.201
Ooh.

22:19.250 --> 22:23.164
Seriously, though,
whatever it takes, I am in.

22:23.210 --> 22:26.589
I'm 100%
on Team "Let's Do This."

22:26.630 --> 22:28.212
Me too.

22:28.260 --> 22:30.331
And I'm thinking we can
make Team "Let's Do This"

22:30.390 --> 22:31.846
a little bigger?

22:31.890 --> 22:33.426
Maybe we could ask
Lizzie and Diego for help.

22:33.470 --> 22:34.801
They went through
all this fertility stuff

22:34.850 --> 22:36.090
when they were trying
to get pregnant.

22:36.140 --> 22:37.471
It's how they ended up
with twins.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.010
Okay.
Well, let's ask them.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.064
And hope to be 50%
as successful as they were.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.726
Yes.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.601
Hey.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.368
I feel like
you've been avoiding me today.

22:52.410 --> 22:56.825
-I have been.
-Okay, I lied about Bark.

22:56.870 --> 22:57.996
I'm sorry.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.826
I just wanted
to hang with you.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.998
And it was fun,
You gotta admit that.

23:02.040 --> 23:06.045
So, unless you got another good
reason why you can't date me,

23:06.090 --> 23:07.501
then you should consider it.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.507
I'm quite the catch.
Ask my dad.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.507
Ohh.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.632
There is another reason.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.802
I'm very attracted to you.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.313
Is it safe to date me now?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.146
I really want
to take you out,

23:28.190 --> 23:32.024
but I am completely poor,
and it's almost my curfew.

23:32.070 --> 23:33.617
Can I cook for you?

23:33.660 --> 23:36.948
Look, Aiden,
you're really sweet, but...

23:36.990 --> 23:38.287
Stop.

23:38.330 --> 23:39.650
You know how many girls
I've been given

23:39.710 --> 23:40.996
the "you're really sweet,
but..." line to?

23:41.040 --> 23:44.032
Me neither, but a lot.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.707
Which is another reason
I can't go out with you.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.378
I know you, Aiden.
I've dated you before.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.672
Way too many times.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.176
I'm not doing it again.

23:52.220 --> 23:55.133
Well, then let's not date.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.921
We'll keep it casual.

23:56.970 --> 23:58.347
That's the point, though.

23:58.390 --> 24:00.472
I'm not looking
for casual.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.397
If I'm going to get involved
with somebody,

24:02.440 --> 24:04.147
I want it to be serious.

24:04.190 --> 24:06.181
I want him to be serious.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.436
I am serious.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.187
You stole a dog
to hang out with me.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.526
I borrowed a dog.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.561
Big difference.

24:12.610 --> 24:14.271
I just can't.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.573
I'll end up
really liking you,

24:16.620 --> 24:18.657
and then
I'll wake up one day,

24:18.700 --> 24:21.328
and you'll be on
to the next girl,

24:21.370 --> 24:24.032
and I'll have wasted
a lot of time.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.412
I'm not gonna -- I'm not --
I'm not planning on meet--

24:26.460 --> 24:28.622
Don't sweat it.
You'll recover.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.126
Tomorrow, you'll meet
another cute girl

24:30.170 --> 24:31.877
and forget all about me.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.331
What if I don't?

24:33.380 --> 24:36.099
You will.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.465
Okay.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.558
C

24:42.600 --> 24:44.932
I really like
hanging out with you.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.550
You have female friends?

24:46.610 --> 24:49.773
It's a brave new world.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.731
What do friends do?

24:51.780 --> 24:53.396
They hang out
and don't have sex.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.942
That sounds awful.

24:55.990 --> 24:58.118
I'm listening.
Tell me more.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.901
Simple stuff.

24:59.950 --> 25:03.534
Like, I'm going for a hike
at dawn the day after tomorrow.

25:03.580 --> 25:06.663
"Hike" and "dawn" are
my two least favorite words.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.701
You just combined them.

25:08.750 --> 25:10.707
I'm in.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.467
I wasn't
actually inviting you.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.547
I was just filling you in
on my morning.

25:16.430 --> 25:17.716
That was so much fun.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.000
It really was.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.300
If you'd told me a week ago

25:20.350 --> 25:22.011
there was a beautiful woman
out there

25:22.060 --> 25:24.802
who would share my passion
for the history of aviation,

25:24.850 --> 25:26.432
I'd have said
you were crazy.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.858
Well, if you'd told me
there was a man out there

25:28.900 --> 25:31.187
who could feign interest
in the pharmaceutical industry

25:31.230 --> 25:34.393
for the last three hours,
I'd have said you were crazy.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.100
Oh,
it really is interesting.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.150
No, it's not.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.565
It's really not.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.487
But your enthusiasm
is contagious.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.860
Listen, Gina...

25:42.910 --> 25:45.493
if you don't have plans
this afternoon,

25:45.540 --> 25:47.872
we could continue this
conversation over lunch.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.706
I'd really like that.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.206
But I do have plans.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.832
Ida: Jean-Bean!

25:52.880 --> 25:55.258
Hey, there.
You ready to hit the market?

25:55.300 --> 25:56.711
I am.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.671
Give me just a second.
Okay.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.711
Hello?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.515
-Well, hello, Peter.
-Ida.

26:05.850 --> 26:08.182
Well, this is silly.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.141
So silly.

26:10.190 --> 26:11.760
You should probably
just give up now.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.026
She's playing on my team.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.981
I really don't think she is.

26:15.030 --> 26:16.691
But maybe we should ask her.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.606
No need.
I'll find out.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.119
And T'll be thinking of you
when I take her home.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.537
That's -- No.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.196
You know
that's not what I meant.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.866
I know
what I wished you meant.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.038
And T'll be thinking of that
on my way home.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.209
Ha!

26:35.300 --> 26:37.871
Oh, and, now, make sure
you lie perfectly still

26:37.930 --> 26:40.001
with your hips above your heart
for at least 15 minutes

26:40.050 --> 26:41.381
after you complete
the conception attempt.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.000
You mean sex.

26:43.060 --> 26:46.052
There's nothing
sexy about making a baby.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.182
All right.
Well, we should get going.

26:48.230 --> 26:49.800
We got a big game today.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.896
Bye.
Bye!

26:54.110 --> 26:55.851
-Okay.
-Mm. Bye.

26:57.190 --> 26:58.442
Seriously, Lizzie,
thank you for today.

26:58.490 --> 27:00.231
It means so much
to have you and Diego

27:00.280 --> 27:01.987
on Team "Let's Do This."

27:02.030 --> 27:03.862
I love you, Stella,
but the only team I'm on

27:03.910 --> 27:05.287
is Team "This is
a Dumb-ass Idea,

27:05.330 --> 27:06.946
and I Think
You Two Are Crazy."

27:07.000 --> 27:08.570
What?

27:13.290 --> 27:15.292
You said you thought I was
gonna be a rock-star mom.

27:15.340 --> 27:16.910
I do. Someday.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.917
No, you literally said --
No, I know what I said.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.540
That's when I thought
you were already pregnant.

27:20.590 --> 27:21.887
How is this any different?

27:21.930 --> 27:23.000
Well, if you were
already pregnant,

27:23.050 --> 27:24.211
I would have
to be supportive.

27:24.260 --> 27:25.386
I'm your sister.
That's my job.

27:25.430 --> 27:26.841
But it's also my job
to tell you

27:26.890 --> 27:29.018
when you're doing
something stupid.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.971
You told me that you and Wes
were having problems.

27:32.020 --> 27:34.261
No, I-I said
that things were complicated

27:34.320 --> 27:35.936
because
of Dr. Grant and Pippa.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.436
Honey, when other people
come into the mix,

27:37.490 --> 27:38.980
it is a symptom
of a bigger issue.

27:39.030 --> 27:41.317
There is no bigger issue.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.862
In fact,
ever since Wes and 1

27:42.910 --> 27:44.526
have started talking
about having a baby,

27:44.580 --> 27:46.070
things have been amazing.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.111
We are on the same team,
and we have a plan.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.867
Wes even turned down
a job in San Francisco

27:49.910 --> 27:51.617
because of how excited
he is to have a baby.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.286
Okay, but when do you get
to the part

27:53.330 --> 27:55.458
when you tell me how excited
you are to have a baby?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.502
You know what?

27:57.550 --> 27:59.791
If this is how you're
gonna be, you can leave.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.296
Stell,
you said it yourself --

28:01.340 --> 28:03.081
You love that
I'm always straight with you.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.256
Okay, that is
all I'm doing here.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.211
Kids don't fix problems.

28:07.260 --> 28:08.887
They make them worse.

28:08.930 --> 28:11.729
Before we had the twins,
Diego and I never fought.

28:11.770 --> 28:14.102
But after?

28:14.150 --> 28:17.188
Ooh,
things got really hard.

28:17.230 --> 28:19.779
We started fighting
about everything.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.198
We almost got a divorce,
Stella.

28:22.240 --> 28:26.529
We spent every Monday night
for two years in therapy.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.321
You said
you joined a bowling league.

28:28.370 --> 28:30.691
Nobody
"joins a bowling league.”

28:30.750 --> 28:32.286
Well, we don't
really have a choice.

28:32.330 --> 28:34.207
If we want to have a baby,
we have to start trying now.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.627
There are other ways
to have a baby.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.661
You don't get it.

28:37.710 --> 28:38.950
You don't get what it's like

28:39.000 --> 28:41.082
to live with a ticking clock
on your life.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.541
I'm not you, Lizzie.

28:42.590 --> 28:45.218
I don't get to sit at home
all perfect and fertile

28:45.260 --> 28:47.342
with my feet up in the air,
taking my sweet time

28:47.390 --> 28:48.676
to write
some stupid children's book

28:48.720 --> 28:51.803
_ that no one
is ever gonna publish.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.852
Okay.
Uh, you know what?

28:57.900 --> 29:01.234
Next time you need help
with something, call Aiden.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.668
Ahh!

29:21.590 --> 29:22.830
Girl problems?

29:22.880 --> 29:24.041
Yeah. You?

29:24.090 --> 29:25.546
Same.

29:25.590 --> 29:26.921
What's up with yours?

29:26.970 --> 29:29.883
She wants to date
a "serious" person.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.967
What about you?
What's your problem?

29:32.020 --> 29:34.011
The woman I like
might like your mom.

29:34.060 --> 29:35.892
That is also a toughie.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.648
Yep.
Couple of toughies.

29:41.230 --> 29:43.358
Hey, there, stranger.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.731
You got a sec?

29:44.780 --> 29:46.771
Denise. Hey.

29:46.820 --> 29:47.946
Ahh!

29:47.990 --> 29:50.573
I'm gonna make myself
a potpie.

30:01.420 --> 30:02.751
You're the lion
that I'm taming

30:02.800 --> 30:04.620
Hey, you

30:04.670 --> 30:06.581
What is all this for?

30:06.630 --> 30:09.008
The candles
are for romance,

30:09.050 --> 30:11.178
and the pillows
are for conception.

30:11.220 --> 30:14.554
"Conception"”
is not a sexy word.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.886
It really isn't.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.511
But you are very sexy.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.188
And so are you,
so get over here.

30:25.610 --> 30:26.941
After the market,

30:26.990 --> 30:29.027
Gina asked me to help her
shop for home goods.

30:29.070 --> 30:30.947
It was very intimate.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.823
There was this one moment in
the small-appliance section...

30:33.870 --> 30:35.952
ah, sparks were flying.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.991
You sure it wasn't
a toaster short

30:38.040 --> 30:41.203
You mock, but it was one
of the best dates I ever had.

30:41.250 --> 30:44.550
I'm gonna call Diego and see
if she said anything about me.

30:46.590 --> 30:48.297
Hey, are you okay?

30:48.340 --> 30:49.717
Yeah.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.830
All good here.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.039
Call away.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.090
Okay.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.687
Mom, I am on my way home,

30:58.730 --> 31:01.142
and I picked up
some Chinese food for dinner.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.568
Diego. Question.
Gina.

31:03.610 --> 31:04.930
That is not a question.

31:04.980 --> 31:06.778
Did she say anything
about me?

31:06.820 --> 31:08.561
I feel like
it's going well.

31:08.610 --> 31:11.113
I threw her a wink, and it felt
like she caught it, but...

31:11.160 --> 31:12.776
<i>- You want me to see
if she caught your wink?</i>

31:12.830 --> 31:13.900
Yes.

31:13.950 --> 31:16.032
Uh, hold on one sec.
Hello?

31:16.080 --> 31:17.070
Diego, hey.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.076
What's up, Pop?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.531
I was just wondering...

31:19.580 --> 31:21.571
has Gina said anything
about me?

31:21.630 --> 31:23.587
We had the best time
at the museum,

31:23.630 --> 31:26.008
but I'm a little confused
about where we stand.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.666
That makes two of us.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.790
What's that
supposed to mean?

31:28.840 --> 31:31.218
Nothing.
Uh...hold on one sec.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.842
Hey. Sorry.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.257
Just do a little digging
for me, okay?

31:35.310 --> 31:37.347
I-T'll see
what I can find out.

31:37.390 --> 31:38.801
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

31:38.850 --> 31:40.056
Hey, you still there?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.226
Yeah.

31:41.270 --> 31:43.557
So, you'll do
a little recon for me?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.180
Nothing I'd rather do.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.686
You're the best.

31:49.150 --> 31:51.198
Oh, boy.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.902
I really am sorry about
the whole drug-bust thing.

31:53.950 --> 31:55.020
I feel like
it was my fault.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.616
It wasn't.
And don't be.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.947
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.149
I think.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.416
I hope.

32:01.460 --> 32:02.950
Being optimistic.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.209
Listen, my husband and I
split up,

32:06.250 --> 32:09.299
and I could really use
some casual fun in my life

32:09.340 --> 32:10.330
if you're game.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.462
You know what's cool?

32:12.510 --> 32:14.797
I think
you are a beautiful woman.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.091
Like,
you are ridiculously hot.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.178
And...I used to be
so attracted to you,

32:20.230 --> 32:21.720
but I'm not anymore.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.807
How is that cool?

32:23.850 --> 32:25.261
I guess it's not
as cool for you.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.563
It's more of a me thing.

32:27.610 --> 32:29.271
I guess
what I'm trying to say is,

32:29.320 --> 32:31.641
the words "casual" and "fun"

32:31.700 --> 32:35.523
are being replaced
by "dawn" and "hike."

32:35.570 --> 32:37.823
And that feels
like progress.

32:37.870 --> 32:40.783
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:40.830 --> 32:43.959
Right.
Also kind of a me thing.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.536
Now, if you'll excuse me,

32:45.580 --> 32:48.914
I'm gonna see if I can
go get in on that potpie.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.137
You know
what I was just thinking?

32:56.180 --> 33:00.629
That I should win some sort
of award for what I just did?

33:00.680 --> 33:04.594
That, and, also...

33:04.650 --> 33:08.769
how cool would it be
if we just made a baby?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.936
On our first try?

33:10.980 --> 33:13.984
I mean, I know
it's a long shot, but...

33:14.030 --> 33:15.941
it's a nice thought,
isn't it?

33:15.990 --> 33:17.947
You told me that you and Wes
were having problems.

33:17.990 --> 33:19.480
How am I supposed
to feel about this?

33:19.540 --> 33:20.905
How was I supposed to feel

33:20.950 --> 33:22.440
about you spending
the night in Seattle?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.207
It's a shame I didn't meet you
seven months ago.

I was supposed
to marry her.

33:25.710 --> 33:26.950
Elizabeth: When other people
come into the mix,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.411
it is a symptom
of a bigger issue.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.121
Stella: Wes even turned down
a job in San Francisco

33:30.170 --> 33:31.956
because of how excited
he is to have a baby.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.796
If we're gonna make this
happen, I need to be here.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.796
I want to be a dad.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.638
Kids don't fix problems.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.750
They make them worse.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.040
Stell?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.465
You okay?

33:40.510 --> 33:44.060
I don't think
I can do this, Wes.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.974
I'm not ready
to have a baby.

33:56.490 --> 33:58.401
I don't understand.

33:58.450 --> 34:02.193
You said that
you wanted our little girl.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.401
What changed?

34:06.080 --> 34:09.072
I just got this clean slate,
you know?

34:10.710 --> 34:14.089
And I've been trying to figure
out who I'm supposed to be.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.371
And I realize
that every choice,

34:16.429 --> 34:18.580
every single decision
I've ever made

34:18.639 --> 34:21.849
has been based
on me being sick.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.347
Thanksgiving on Easter.

34:25.389 --> 34:27.518
And it's not just because
it's a better holiday.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.018
It's because nobody thought

34:30.060 --> 34:32.266
that I would make it
to November.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.481
Even you and I got married

34:35.530 --> 34:38.818
because we thought
we had no time.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.737
What are you saying?

34:40.780 --> 34:42.987
I'm saying...

34:44.580 --> 34:45.945
we heed
to take our time here.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.208
We...can't rush
into having a baby.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.991
But you heard
what the doctor said.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.373
If we don't do this now, then
we might not get to at all.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.581
Then we might not get to.

34:56.630 --> 34:59.588
Not in the way we imagined,
anyway.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.803

other ways to be a family.

It's not okay.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.180
I get it.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.699
But we're married, Stells.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.947
So you don't get to make
all the decisions all the time.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.025
We're a team.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.572
I don't make
"all" the decisions.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.076
Yes, you do.

All the important ones,
anyway.

is about your wants

and your needs
and your feelings.

about what I want?

35:52.270 --> 35:54.728
I'm gonna stay
at Diego's tonight.

36:01.070 --> 36:02.606
Good.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.946
Come on.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.866
Hey.

36:06.910 --> 36:08.116

Which, for me,
is still very early.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.661
I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

36:12.710 --> 36:14.030
I almost didn't.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.037
Turns out I have
a morning curfew, too.

thrilled by the piercing alarm

Well, sounds like
you're all warmed up,

right?

We're supposed
to bring our own water?

winking at me.

my total blessing.

though, so...

to this much trouble

Thank you so much.

I said you deserve it.

Hey, I-I told Ida

37:32.750 --> 37:34.866
that I was not signing off
on that nickname.

37:37.540 --> 37:41.044
I didn't know how Wes and I
were going to get through this.

37:43.840 --> 37:47.504
And the worst part was, the one
person I wanted to talk to

37:47.550 --> 37:49.962
wasn't speaking to me.

37:53.810 --> 37:57.974
I would have come sooner,
but...

37:58.020 --> 37:59.510
the ros had to chill,

37:59.560 --> 38:03.019
and I couldn't find my copy
of "Sweet November."

38:03.070 --> 38:04.356
What are you doing here?

38:04.400 --> 38:05.982
I was so mean to you.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.816
I'm your big sister.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.658
I'll always be here.

No matter what.

Ida:
She's as good as yours, Peter.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.426
Thanks, Ida.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.256
I appreciate
the concession call.

All is fair in love and war.

For what it's worth, if she
were even a little bit bi...

she would have picked you.

38:34.850 --> 38:37.137
Uh...duh.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.557
I'm amazing.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.568
Now, you two go have fun.

38:41.610 --> 38:45.103
And, please, do all
the things that I would do.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.278
[ Whitley's "More Than Life"
plays ]

38:47.320 --> 38:49.231
Ready to go?

38:53.490 --> 38:55.618
Belief
Ah.

38:55.660 --> 38:58.789
In the breeze

38:58.830 --> 39:01.288
The smoky morning haze

39:01.330 --> 39:02.707
That was fun.

39:02.750 --> 39:04.912
You liked hiking?
No.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.587
Hiking was exhausting.

39:07.880 --> 39:11.009
So, I'm moving into
a new place tomorrow.

39:11.050 --> 39:13.098
How would you feel
about giving me a hand?

39:13.140 --> 39:14.460
I feel like
that's something you do

39:14.510 --> 39:15.807
when you're sleeping
with someone.

39:15.850 --> 39:17.557
Or if you're friends
with someone.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.886
Then count me in.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.056
- Do I have
to bring my own water?

39:21.100 --> 39:23.262
Come on, Misty.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.890
Then goes away

39:24.940 --> 39:26.146
Ahh!

39:27.190 --> 39:28.567
Mm!

39:28.610 --> 39:31.238
And we are homeward bound

39:32.820 --> 39:36.905
And I

39:36.950 --> 39:38.327
What was that for?

39:38.370 --> 39:40.998
Don't ask questions.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.826
Women are confusing.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.990
To touch

39:46.050 --> 39:48.712
Something real

39:48.760 --> 39:50.546
You were right.

39:51.970 --> 39:53.961
There are bigger issues.

39:54.010 --> 39:56.388
What are they?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.130
Wes is amazing.

40:02.520 --> 40:05.148
But I'm just not sure
if we're gonna last forever.

40:06.860 --> 40:09.067
Do you still love him?

40:09.110 --> 40:10.600
So much.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.948
Then you don't give up.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.151
You work on it.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.192
I want this more than life

40:19.250 --> 40:21.150
I knew Lizzie was right.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.373
I want this more than life

40:24.420 --> 40:26.707
I couldn't give up.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.162
I was ready to fight for us.

40:29.210 --> 40:32.714
I just hoped
it wasn't too late.

40:32.760 --> 40:36.298
I want this more than life

40:38.850 --> 40:41.683
I want this more than life
