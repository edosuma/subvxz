00:18.309 --> 00:19.269
Yours!

00:19.352 --> 00:21.771
You are perfect as this
character, Mrs. Sanders.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.566
Samantha, and thank you.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.234
So, did you enjoy rehearsal?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.402
We loved it.
As a matter of fact,

00:27.485 --> 00:28.903
we're running late.
We gotta go.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.448
{\an3}DAVID:
Um, uh...

00:32.490 --> 00:35.285
Mrs.-- Samantha, um...

00:35.368 --> 00:37.120
{\an1}I really want
to ask you a favor.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.330
{\an1}I-I... I do a radio show
up at KVIB,

00:39.414 --> 00:41.624
{\an1}and I'd really like
to interview you.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.960
Well, I'm not exactly
rock and roll.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.754
{\an1}Oh, well, it's
alternative mostly.

00:45.837 --> 00:49.090
Alternative?

00:49.174 --> 00:50.467
David, I'm honored,

00:50.550 --> 00:53.470
but I don't consider myself
alternative.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.180
{\an3}No, no, that's not
what he meant.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.431
I don't want to be

00:56.514 --> 00:58.808
a spokesperson
for the gay lifestyle.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.020
{\an3}(sighs)

01:02.103 --> 01:04.480
Uh, did you just say...?

01:04.563 --> 01:08.818
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.448
{\an1}Yeah, uh, yeah,
okay, yeah, sure.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.454
I thought that's why
he wanted me on the show.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.414
He's a fan.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.626
{\an3}In ninth grade, he
used to trail after me,

01:24.709 --> 01:26.795
wanting to meet you.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.838
Haven't you talked
to anyone about this?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.006
{\an3}No.

01:30.089 --> 01:32.300
I wanted to protect
your privacy.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.552
I know this is hard for you.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.347
I told you, it's okay
to talk to your friends.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.474
You're gay.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.850
Congratulations, Mom.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.560
What else is there to say?

01:42.644 --> 01:44.229
The truth.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.855
That you're ashamed of me.

All righty.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.336
Ooh, business
is booming.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.547
Yep, and I haven't helped you
with a single sale.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.215
Oh, please, your grandfather's
in the hospital.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.716
Don't worry about it.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.554
Matthew, working late?

02:17.637 --> 02:20.014
Just billing, unfortunately.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.391
No new cases.

{\an3}Christmas.
This whole goodwill-

02:23.309 --> 02:24.894
toward-men thing
cuts way into my business.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.230
Oh, that's the spirit.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.733
Um, I was thinking driving
around Hancock Park,

02:30.817 --> 02:33.278
maybe taking a look
at the Christmas lights.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.613
Oh, do people have them up yet?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.074
Well, we'll park and wait.

He can't breathe;
I don't know what to do!

02:45.331 --> 02:46.416
Mom, slow down.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.251
He has pneumonia.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.419
Yeah, his breathing got so fast,

02:49.502 --> 02:51.254
but he wasn't
getting enough oxygen.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.422
They want to put him
on this machine

02:52.505 --> 02:53.882
that will breathe for him.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.758
He doesn't want
any machines, Mom.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.554
He is struggling
for every breath.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.556
If we don't intubate him,
they said we'll lose him.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.392
In his living will,
it says no extraordinary

life-saving measures.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.102
You have final say.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.812
He has been doing
so much better.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.772
He could have weeks left,
months!

03:09.856 --> 03:11.441
He doesn't want
to suffer anymore.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.443
He needs air!

03:13.526 --> 03:15.570
All right, put the doctor on.

Hello, this is the doctor.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.243
Yeah, hi. I'm Kelly Taylor.

So, the ventilator
breathes for him?

05:38.046 --> 05:42.592
Yeah, he has this huge tube
down his throat.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.260
Donna, it's really awful.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.262
Okay, I'll come by right away.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.266
No, you know, he's stabilized,
and I think I'm gonna be okay.

I have to go; the doctor's here.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.605
Okay, thanks.

{\an3}His lungs weren't passing
enough carbon dioxide.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.405

his confusion.

{\an3}But the ventilator's
breathing for him now.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.117
{\an1}Does that--
the thing hurt him?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.536
He's on pain medication
for the moment.

Oh, in the future,
a chalkboard will really help.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.291
Um, till then just work out
some signals with him.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.794
{\an3}For what?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.337
To communicate with him.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.464
He might be on that ventilator
indefinitely.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.757
But he's alive.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.926
That's the main thing.

06:32.725 --> 06:37.105
You saved his life.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.316

06:53.913 --> 06:56.165
Yeah, definitely.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.167
All right, add it
to the pile, then.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.263
{\an1}Oh, please,
two years ago,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.097
she was crazy
about Clare's father.

nuts about yoga.

a chameleon.

she knows what she wants.

that the thought
of two women together

08:51.989 --> 08:53.282
doesn't excite you?

Oh, uh... (chuckles)

09:36.701 --> 09:39.036
You were sleeping,
I took a walk to Pediatrics.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.955
Beat some kid at tic-tac-toe.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.999
Ah, well, that's an achievement.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.500
Yeah.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.252
I, uh, I spoke to your mom.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.461
She gave me an update.

What are you doing here?

10:10.401 --> 10:11.402
Uh, taking a deposition.

10:11.485 --> 10:15.239
{\an3}The hours on this case,
we could build a pyramid.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.490
{\an3}All right.
How's things by you?

10:16.574 --> 10:19.076
I'm choking, looking
at that tie of yours,

but you wouldn't understand.

Yeah, well, I'm trying to get
his attention just like you are.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.459
{\an1}Yeah, well,
crane your neck.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.335
Hey, Noah.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.379
Uh, the movie's
only playing this week.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.297
Um, remind Donna.
We'll go with you.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.425
Oh, yeah, well,
Donna has to work.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.510
He rejected you.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.139
{\an3}Hey, that was a question,
not an offer.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.391
Yeah, right.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.308
He's a friend.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.310
(beer dripping)

12:08.394 --> 12:10.438
Thanks.
Let's keep it that way.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.398
{\an1}(sighs)

12:14.400 --> 12:16.318
Excuse me. Hey.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.279
{\an1}This guy's
a little wasted,

12:18.362 --> 12:19.905
{\an3}and he's got a pretty
short fuse. I'd watch it.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.615
Yeah, I saw.
I'm not serving him.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.117
You're not serving him?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.160
Oh, that's a start.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.121
I'll take your course
on what I should do next.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.456
In the meantime,
relax, all right?

12:32.501 --> 12:34.211
{\an3}So, is, uh,
is this true?

12:34.295 --> 12:37.214
I said do not touch me,
all right?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.883
{\an3}What, was this a big hit
at the trailer park?

12:38.966 --> 12:41.010
{\an1}Do you see a girl
who's interested in you?

12:41.093 --> 12:42.344
No, I just see a skank

12:42.428 --> 12:43.637
who's had one too many
needles stuck in her.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.514
Oh, really?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.515
{\an1}(gasps)

12:46.599 --> 12:47.725
{\an6}MAN:
Hey!
(gasps)

12:47.808 --> 12:49.268
Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:49.351 --> 12:50.227
Hey, let go.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.228
{\an3}Come on,

12:51.312 --> 12:52.605
{\an1}back off!

12:54.190 --> 12:55.608
Break up! You'll wish
I called the cops.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.076
{\an3}I don't like
being interrupted.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.369
You didn't bother talking
about it.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.871
You had some kind of
pissing contest.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.247
Dylan, come on, man.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.249
{\an3}We don't want any fights
in here, all right?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.376
Then keep this guy out
of my face.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.216
{\an3}This punk's
got to pay!

13:20.299 --> 13:22.051
{\an3}You don't be pushing
us around!

13:22.134 --> 13:23.052
(guy laughs)

13:23.135 --> 13:24.303
Oh, yeah.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.349
(glass shattering)

13:28.432 --> 13:30.226
Hey!

13:30.684 --> 13:32.394
Hey!

13:34.647 --> 13:36.565
{\an1}(grunting):
You son of a...

13:36.649 --> 13:37.566
Dylan!

13:37.650 --> 13:38.400
{\an3}(grunting)

13:38.484 --> 13:39.318
Stop!

13:39.401 --> 13:42.238
{\an3}Only one of us is
afraid to die here.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.614
(car engine starting)

13:50.704 --> 13:52.706
Is this your car?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.250
Get away from her.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.897
(birds chirping)

14:23.487 --> 14:25.447
Hey.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.283
How long you been out here?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.368
The sun was up.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.247
Sad day for German
engineering, huh?

14:33.330 --> 14:35.457
You know, we could probably
help you put this windshield

14:35.541 --> 14:37.293
back in.
That's okay.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.252
If we each take a side,

14:38.335 --> 14:39.753
and somebody could steady it
from the rear.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.755
{\an3}I said no.
All right.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.632
{\an3}But thanks.
Sure.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.092
{\an4}NOAH:
Dave, somebody
from the station

14:45.175 --> 14:46.260
{\an1}left these for you
at the club.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.429
{\an3}Some kind of contract
or something.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.639
They need it
back today.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.266
Oh, this must
be the release

14:52.349 --> 14:54.602
for Steve's mom
to do my show.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.020
You guys want some coffee?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.354
Nah. I gotta go.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.150
{\an1}All right.
Thanks.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.654
You got a hole here, man.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.323
(three gunshots)

15:11.869 --> 15:14.330
I know a guy
who does vintage cars.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.999
I said no.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.960
Very in your face.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.420
Look where it gets you.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.230
You wanted to see me?

15:40.314 --> 15:41.440
Did you see this?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.321
It's garbage, Mom.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.323
Nobody reads this.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.368
{\an3}Bill, who plays my husband
in the show,

15:52.451 --> 15:54.536
dropped a kiss
at the end of a scene.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.039
It's in the script, we're
both professional actors,

15:57.122 --> 15:59.375
suddenly he's afraid
I'd hate it.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.753
I hate that.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.837
I'm sorry.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.381
{\an3}Do you know how
hard it was

16:05.464 --> 16:07.049
for me to tell you I'm gay.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.592
{\an3}I knew it would
hurt you.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.219
Look, this is a rag.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.845
{\an1}Nobody takes it
seriously.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.222
I do.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.599
Did you tell a reporter

16:15.683 --> 16:18.060
{\an3}that you weren't
my son?

16:18.143 --> 16:19.436
Uh...

16:19.520 --> 16:22.439
Did you tell a stranger
you weren't my son?

16:22.523 --> 16:24.900
How do you think I felt?

16:24.983 --> 16:26.235
{\an1}Somebody calls me
at work

16:26.318 --> 16:27.403
to tell me about my mother

16:27.486 --> 16:28.404
sleeping with another woman.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.406
They have no right to pry!

16:30.489 --> 16:31.573
It's their job.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.242
That's what they do.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.244
You chose this life.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.620
The celebrity, all of it.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.748
I did not choose to be gay!

16:41.834 --> 16:43.794
What sort of mother
would suit you?

16:43.877 --> 16:47.256
Should I bake cookies?
Volunteer at the library?

16:47.339 --> 16:49.091
Run a Girl Scout troop.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.342
They wouldn't let you.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.056
I didn't mean that.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.434
Have I always had
these feelings?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.437
I don't know, maybe.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.440
If I was afraid to act on them,
can you blame me?

17:04.522 --> 17:06.608
You want my honest response?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.902
{\an3}Okay.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.904
Don't do this.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.991
Just... don't.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.578
(sighs)

17:18.537 --> 17:20.705
Your agent called.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.416
{\an1}Emergency meeting
with the powers-that-be.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.468
I was treating Mrs. Klein
during your visit,

17:32.551 --> 17:34.428
so I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation

17:34.511 --> 17:36.513
or notice that you're scum.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.433
(gasps)

17:39.516 --> 17:40.601
Let me guess.

17:40.684 --> 17:41.810
You're working.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.771
Taking a deposition.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.773
{\an3}Feel the need
to add anything?

17:45.856 --> 17:47.775
It's your job.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.777
{\an1}I understand,
but this time...

17:49.860 --> 17:51.153
It's someone you love.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.155
{\an1}I just don't understand
the draw of smoking.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.323
{\an1}I mean,
something's burning,

17:54.406 --> 17:55.824
{\an1}you don't lean in
and suck on it.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.451
{\an3}Well, it's
the nicotine.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.996
Besides, it's something to do
with your hands, you know.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.375
You-you make me nervous,
you ever notice that?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.379
Yesterday when I woke up,
and you were here,

18:09.463 --> 18:10.422
I was so glad to see you.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.635
But I really wish
you weren't here doing this.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.512
Well, there are two sides.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.180
So, be on mine.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.182
Looking at you right now,

18:20.265 --> 18:22.643
I couldn't imagine
being on any other, but...

18:22.726 --> 18:25.604
but your grandfather knew
the dangers of smoking.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.524
So, it was his fault
that he got emphysema?

18:28.607 --> 18:31.360
Look, there's a warning

18:31.443 --> 18:33.362
right on the label.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.822
Right there.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.407
You smoke?

18:37.491 --> 18:41.578
No, I-- well, yeah,
I... I started again

18:41.662 --> 18:42.871
{\an3}recently.
It's...

18:42.955 --> 18:45.249
So, this isn't about freedom
of choice.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.417
This is defending

18:47.501 --> 18:48.210
your own habit.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.878
No, two separate issues.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.422
The fact is, Kelly, I represent
all types of clients.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.216
Let me just ask you something.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.553
If a client came to you and
said, "I'm thinking of killing

18:57.636 --> 18:58.554
someone..."

18:58.637 --> 19:00.180
With a drug like nicotine.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.724
You wouldn't help them do it,
would you?

19:09.565 --> 19:10.899
(sighs)

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
Hi.
Hey.

19:21.159 --> 19:23.328
That dress would look great
on you.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.248
My dad got a job,

19:26.331 --> 19:28.625
so we can invite everybody
to this party we're having.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.294
{\an3}Oh, yeah, what's
the party for?

19:30.377 --> 19:32.421
Me. It's my 15th birthday.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.464
{\an3}Hey, can I try this on?
Yeah, sure.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.592
Right this way.
Thanks.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.055
{\an3}DONNA: There you go.
SONIA: Thanks.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.770
Uh, check her bag
before she leaves.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.814
{\an3}No, no, no. I'm keeping
an eye on her.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.274
{\an1}Yeah, but
where's her posse?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.109
{\an3}No, she came in alone.
She's only 15.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.153
All right, if you want
to be her first felony.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.739
Or maybe the first person
who's gonna give her a break.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.955
Look at you!

20:07.039 --> 20:08.957
Do I took stupid?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.459
Like a kid?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.336
You look beautiful.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.089
Whoa.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.925
Do you have, like, layaway
or something?

20:22.179 --> 20:23.847
Sure.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.265
When's the party?

20:25.349 --> 20:26.975
Actually, I need it today,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.977
{\an3}but I could pay you back
in a couple of weeks.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.771
I got this after-school job,
so...

20:30.854 --> 20:33.774
Um... okay.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.275
Uh, why don't you give me

20:35.359 --> 20:37.611
{\an3}the name of your employer,
some identification,

20:37.694 --> 20:39.237
and then the dress is yours.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.113
Thanks.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.365
Sure.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.662
You're never gonna see
the money.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.497
You don't know that.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.623
Look, you pity her.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.876
For that, you'll pay.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.341
WOMAN (over PA):
Nurse Supervisor, dial 521.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.552
{\an3}Hey, where's
his ventilator?

21:05.555 --> 21:07.474
{\an1}The doctor's didn't
remove the ventilator.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.142
{\an1}He pulled it out
himself.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.519
How could he do that?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.062
{\an1}Well, apparently
it happens.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.856
The patients get disoriented,
and they're uncomfortable.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.899
Fortunately,

21:15.983 --> 21:17.818
{\an1}he managed
to breathe on his own.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.531
Well, the antibiotics have
cleared up the pneumonia;

21:22.614 --> 21:24.533
blood oxygen seems
to be holding.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.867
So, he's gonna be okay?

21:25.951 --> 21:26.994
Well, he's doing well.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.330
For a man with severe emphysema,

21:30.414 --> 21:32.416
that prognosis
isn't gonna change.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.511
Hey, Grandpa.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.554
What are these?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.389
Take these off of him.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.557
He was trying to get out of bed.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.185
I can't stand this.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.355
I didn't know what to do,
Grandpa.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.942
I told you, let me die.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.779
It was for his own good.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.240
(Velcro unfastening)

22:05.323 --> 22:07.409
{\an1}Shh. Shh.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.830
{\an1}Did you see
what they did to him?

22:11.913 --> 22:13.373
{\an3}Kelly...

22:13.457 --> 22:15.375
{\an1}They strapped him
down, Mom.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.918
Yes. I know.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.879
{\an1}(sighs)

22:18.962 --> 22:20.380
What I did...

22:20.464 --> 22:23.592
I convinced myself that I did it
for him, but I didn't.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.093
I did it for me.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.304
{\an1}When I had
to make the decision about

22:27.387 --> 22:30.432
whether to keep him alive
or not...

22:32.517 --> 22:34.603
...I actually thought
about Christmas morning

22:34.686 --> 22:38.815
and how much I would miss him
if he wasn't there.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.068
I want him with us, too.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.780
You thought you were
being selfish. You weren't.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.448
You love him.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.368
Then I should have let him go.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.663
(sighs)

22:53.747 --> 22:55.499
Get me out of
here, Dylan.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.837
(sighs)

23:03.173 --> 23:05.092
(child shouting playfully)

23:05.175 --> 23:07.302
{\an3}KELLY: My grandfather used
to push me so high,

23:07.385 --> 23:09.096
{\an3}my mom would
freak out.

23:09.179 --> 23:12.390
{\an1}Hey, I thought you wanted
to get away from all of that.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.602
{\an1}Where would I go?
There are some

23:15.685 --> 23:17.312
places I could recommend.

23:18.396 --> 23:19.815
Well, you're here now.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.441
What are you
going to do?

23:21.525 --> 23:25.153
I paid a pretty high price
for my leisure time.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.198
You gonna stay?

23:28.281 --> 23:31.201
You want me to push you?

23:39.292 --> 23:41.086
I could have given him morphine.

23:41.169 --> 23:44.005
Let him slip away, they said.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.383
But I said no.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.343
Some things
you just can't fight.

23:48.426 --> 23:49.553
{\an1}Not everything's
black and white, Dylan,

23:49.636 --> 23:50.804
not when you have a choice.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.473
What do you want me to say,
that you did the wrong thing?

23:53.557 --> 23:57.352
{\an1}No. You could stop acting like
it's all beyond our control.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.354
Some things are.

23:59.437 --> 24:00.981
Not this.

24:01.064 --> 24:04.359
Kelly, he has emphysema.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.486
{\an3}He's dying. The
only question

24:06.570 --> 24:09.322
is whether
it's gonna be his way, or yours.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.968
(grunts)

24:35.849 --> 24:38.435
This is for your thirst.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.731
{\an1}This is for your hunger,
and this

24:42.814 --> 24:44.733
would be for coming
to my rescue.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.866
{\an3}I keep hearing how
grateful I should be.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.242
Oh.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.535
(clears throat)

24:55.619 --> 24:58.288
Well, uh, you're welcome.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.415
Oh. Uh, by the way,

25:00.498 --> 25:03.376
I know how to handle guys
like that, so we're even.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.253
Yeah, I could tell.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.881
Um, who was your first
serious boyfriend anyway?

25:07.964 --> 25:10.592
Some hillbilly?

25:10.675 --> 25:13.637
You know, beer, pizza,
low-cut top.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.847
You really think
guys are that simple?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.432
I've had boyfriends.

25:17.515 --> 25:18.934
Yeah, boys.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.435
(spits)

25:20.519 --> 25:23.438
Look, I might have
been a little busy.

25:23.521 --> 25:26.650
Skating was my life.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.109
I was a national finalist.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.111
Were you number one?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.406
It's a legitimate question.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.243
Well, I finished a three-minute
program with a broken ankle.

25:36.326 --> 25:39.579
Well, competition
must have been fierce.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.623
{\an4}Duh.
You know,
their gain is

25:41.706 --> 25:43.416
your loss.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.336
Everybody's always trying
to take what you got.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.463
Well, right. That's the way
of the world, right?

25:48.546 --> 25:50.257
That's one way
to look at it.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.633
Here's another.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.134
You have this cousin.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.469
She takes you in.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.096
You thank her.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.681
Yeah, I'm very grateful to her.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.474
You don't try to take

25:59.557 --> 26:02.435
{\an1}what she has, because
Donna's happiness does not

26:02.519 --> 26:03.812
cost you a point.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.438
What you do?

26:05.522 --> 26:07.482
Watch some documentary
on figure skaters?

26:07.565 --> 26:09.776
Why Noah?

26:09.859 --> 26:11.444
I mean, really?

26:11.528 --> 26:14.948
Of all the guys in this town,
why.... Noah?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.658
{\an1}I don't know.
'Cause if you get him,

26:16.741 --> 26:19.327
you know that all you've done
is get the wrong guy.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.288
{\an1}Definitely not
first place, and

26:21.371 --> 26:22.289
definitely not number one.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.833
You can get tattoos

26:24.916 --> 26:28.336
removed, you know,
if it's not working for you.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.972
{\an1}When I was in
the fifth grade,

26:39.055 --> 26:42.309
{\an1}he could still throw me up
high over his head.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.394
He was so strong.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.731
{\an1}Imposing.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.774
He would tell me
the best stories.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.526
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:51.609 --> 26:54.696
{\an1}Now, he gets winded
saying his name.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.866
Could have lived
so much longer.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.369
(sighs)

27:01.453 --> 27:03.997
If it weren't for these.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.082
(sighs)

27:08.668 --> 27:09.878
{\an1}Hi, Matt.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.087
Nice to see you.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.340
(sighs)

27:13.423 --> 27:16.009
The nurses said he wouldn't
eat anything all day.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.011
He hates hospital food.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.596
Yeah, well, he needs nutrition.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.223
I'll have to talk to him
about a feeding tube.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.100
It goes through the nose
and down into the stomach.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.102
Oh, my God, no!

27:26.186 --> 27:27.937
That's too much.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.731
He wants to be left alone.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.733
He's still competent, isn't he?

27:31.816 --> 27:32.817
Yeah.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.487
Then it's his choice.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.739
{\an6}DOCTOR:
He'll refuse the tube,
he'll weaken,

27:37.822 --> 27:38.907
the pneumonia could come back,

27:38.990 --> 27:40.283
and we'll be right back
where we started.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.493
And he'd need
the ventilator again?

27:41.576 --> 27:44.746
If you want us to continue
to aggressively treat him, yes.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.374
He's had enough, Mom.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.958
You know he's had enough.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.549
How soon can he be released?

27:56.633 --> 27:59.969
Medically, I would have
to advise against that.

28:00.053 --> 28:03.390
{\an1}But if it was your father,
you'd do the same thing.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.395
(gasping for air)

28:13.024 --> 28:14.484
(crying)

28:21.199 --> 28:22.659
How about closing
up early tonight?

28:22.742 --> 28:24.285
I can't.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.620
(laughs)

28:25.703 --> 28:26.955
{\an3}Mmm.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.623
How about closing for one hour?

28:28.706 --> 28:29.958
Hmm.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.292
{\an3}GINA:
Hey.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.295
{\an3}So what's the
deal with Dylan?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.089
Uh, don't touch his car.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.674
He's very particular
about his car.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.468
His wife was shot in that car.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.846
He was married?

28:42.929 --> 28:44.764
Yeah.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.474
And her family was involved

28:46.558 --> 28:48.268
with some sort of
illegal business.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.437
{\an1}She got caught
in the crossfire.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.272
She was shot in the car
and died in his arms.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.274
Wow. That's intense.

28:54.357 --> 28:58.611
{\an3}Oh, man, I-I pointed out these
holes in his passenger seat.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.530
They were bullet holes.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.366
You didn't know.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.705
(knocking)

29:10.290 --> 29:14.294
Janet said you went home sick
with the stomach flu.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.671
Well, I'm feeling better.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.925
And a fever.

29:22.510 --> 29:25.972
{\an3}The truth is, you're
embarrassed by the rumors.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.475
{\an3}I get dragged out
of the closet,

29:28.558 --> 29:30.143
and you go running in.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.352
(sighs)

29:33.313 --> 29:34.856
I was fired.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.066
What?

29:37.150 --> 29:39.319
Well, this way, I'll just fade
into the woodwork,

29:39.402 --> 29:41.988
so you won't
be publicly humiliated.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.364
How can they do that?

29:43.448 --> 29:45.742
It was a creative decision.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.994
They're writing the mother out.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.704
They fired you
because you're gay.

29:49.787 --> 29:52.582
Who wants a homosexual
in their living room?

29:52.665 --> 29:54.334
Not you.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.544
(sighs)

29:56.628 --> 29:58.379
You're my mother.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.714
That's a little different.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.883
Because I don't fit
some idea you had

30:01.966 --> 30:03.384
about who your mother is?

30:03.468 --> 30:05.345
Who she is, who she was.

30:05.428 --> 30:08.765
I was wondering why you even
got married in the first place.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.391
Why did you adopt a kid?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.060
Was this some kind
of cover-up, Mom?

30:12.143 --> 30:13.353
I mean, you must have known.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.854
Steve!

30:14.938 --> 30:17.357
Did you really want a kid?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.566
Did you really...?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.485
Did you really want me?

30:23.321 --> 30:26.074
Holding you in my arms,

30:26.157 --> 30:30.870
raising you was the best job
that I ever had.

30:30.954 --> 30:34.082
{\an3}For years, it was the
one decision I made

30:34.165 --> 30:36.417
that I knew was right.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.388
So, how come it never worked out
between Dylan and Kelly?

30:48.471 --> 30:50.640
{\an3}(laughs)
Sizing up the competition?

30:50.723 --> 30:53.560
No. I'm just curious.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.770
What I do know
about Kelly is,

30:55.853 --> 30:57.272
she's my best friend,

30:57.355 --> 30:58.731
she's my business partner,

30:58.815 --> 31:00.108
she's your roommate.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.609
{\an1}All right.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.695
(laughs)

31:05.488 --> 31:06.948
Hey.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.157
About the dress...

31:08.241 --> 31:09.951
{\an3}LUCY:
It was messed up.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.286
She ain't
paying for it.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.954
{\an3}What's wrong
with the dress?

31:13.037 --> 31:15.039
Show her.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.002
It had a rip...

31:19.085 --> 31:21.296
{\an1}ADRIAN:
When she bought it.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.047
Now she's returning it,
so she don't owe you nothing.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.092
{\an1}ADRIAN:
Yeah, girl.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.385
(giggling)

31:27.468 --> 31:28.386
Sonia?

31:29.637 --> 31:30.805
I trusted you.

31:30.888 --> 31:32.849
Yeah, well, you screwed up.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.186
(all laughing)

31:47.530 --> 31:48.531
(knocking)

31:54.412 --> 31:56.414
Hey.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.501
My grandfather's being released
from the hospital tomorrow.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.005
(sighs)

32:04.088 --> 32:05.548
He's gonna die.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.137
{\an1}He tried to quit smoking,
but he never could.

32:13.139 --> 32:16.476
{\an1}I keep telling myself
we're just old friends.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.311
Does that work for you?

32:18.394 --> 32:21.230
Not always.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.650
Something to do
with your hands.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.736
{\an1}That's what someone
once told me about smoking.

32:26.819 --> 32:30.073
It's an addiction.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.325
It's terrible for you.

32:32.408 --> 32:35.203
I keep saying
I don't understand.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.871
{\an3}But you do.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.332
You know you do.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.086
I was doing okay
before you came back.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.380
Yeah.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.340
Lately, I've, um...

32:47.423 --> 32:49.342
I've been thinking,

32:49.425 --> 32:54.263
this probably isn't
very good for you.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.765
I don't care.

33:15.993 --> 33:18.496
(yelling)

33:20.456 --> 33:22.667
(screaming)

33:25.044 --> 33:26.587
{\an3}(muttering)

33:26.671 --> 33:28.715
{\an1}Hey, Dylan.
(yelling)

33:30.341 --> 33:32.260
What are you doing?
It's all right, man.

33:32.343 --> 33:35.054
{\an3}The door was open;
I heard you screaming.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.140
David's not here right now.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.403
{\an3}The other day
about the car, man.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.572
I didn't know.

33:52.655 --> 33:55.408
As far as those dreams
and night sweats you're having,

33:55.491 --> 33:56.325
I've had them.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.327
{\an3}I know what
they're about.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.497
My old man killed himself,
and I knew this girl.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.503
{\an1}It wasn't my favorite topic
either, all right?

34:07.587 --> 34:11.466
So, we're blood brothers now?

34:11.549 --> 34:15.303
{\an1}Yeah, sure, whenever
you're ready, man.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.554
I wouldn't sit by the phone.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.842
{\an1}So, how long ago
did you quit?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.303
About 40 years too late.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.222
You?

34:59.305 --> 35:02.475
About 18 hours ago.

35:02.558 --> 35:03.476
This time for good.

35:03.559 --> 35:04.519
(chuckles)

35:04.602 --> 35:05.603
Mm.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.731
Hi, Grandpa.

35:08.815 --> 35:09.899
{\an1}Hey.
Matt.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.359
Well, we can take a break,

35:11.442 --> 35:12.819
but the board doesn't move.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.028
I'm winning.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.029
Oh, yes, it does.

35:15.112 --> 35:16.531
Daddy...

35:17.323 --> 35:18.407
...you're being released.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.868
Yep, we're getting you
out of here.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.204
Oh, I'll skip the good-byes.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.580
Where are my pants?

35:32.755 --> 35:34.382
You quit smoking.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.383
Congratulations.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.717
Dropped the tobacco case, too.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.178
{\an3}You know, you
should be a lawyer.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.555
And you like my grandfather.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.724
Your grandfather
is Mr. Perfect.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.935
So, what do you say
we celebrate?

35:46.018 --> 35:48.521
I should really help
get him settled.

35:48.604 --> 35:50.022
Yeah, after.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.567
I don't really know
how long it's gonna take.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.318
It's okay, uh, tomorrow.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.989
The next night?

36:00.825 --> 36:02.743
Can we stop playing
date book here?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.120
Matt, I really want to be
straight with you

36:04.203 --> 36:05.413
about everything.

36:05.496 --> 36:06.956
Well, you can
spare me the details.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.207
It's not real complicated.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.585
On the one hand,
there's this guy

36:10.668 --> 36:12.253
{\an3}you once had
something great with.

36:12.336 --> 36:16.424
But on the other hand,

36:16.507 --> 36:22.763
there's this really great guy
you could miss out on.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.895
(sighs)

36:33.149 --> 36:34.442
It's only ten dollars.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.235
{\an3}I'll give you the rest
of what I owe you.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.236
Save it.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.280
{\an3}With that knife yesterday,
you made your point.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.282
I didn't want to do that.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.450
Look, I could work it off.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.118
Push a broom, anything.

36:44.201 --> 36:46.162
(Donna sighs)

36:46.245 --> 36:47.288
Why did you come back here?

36:47.371 --> 36:50.291
{\an3}I told you--
about the dress.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.794
{\an1}Why don't you tell me
about the birthday party?

36:53.878 --> 36:54.503
You didn't go, right?

36:54.587 --> 36:56.964
My mom cooked all day.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.133
My aunts and uncles were there.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.468
Lucy said if I went, I was out.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.345
Of the gang.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.096
Why don't you just say it,
you're in a gang?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.264
They're my friends.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.599
Friends don't threaten you.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.184
You don't understand.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.311
They want me to do a drug run.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.979
Isaac, he's Adrian's boyfriend.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.773
He's got, like,
this business.

37:13.856 --> 37:16.442
Sonia, what you need to do
is get away from these girls.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.652
In my neighborhood,

37:17.735 --> 37:19.445
you're in or you're a target.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.822
{\an3}I met Lucy
in Arts and Crafts

37:21.906 --> 37:23.783
in the park when we were 12.

37:23.866 --> 37:26.327
{\an3}Now there's no more
after-school programs.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.329
There's nothing to do.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.082
{\an3}And one day,
these girls jump me.

37:31.165 --> 37:35.044
Lucy, Mouse, Adrian,
they go after them.

37:35.127 --> 37:37.254
{\an3}This one girl's
got a razor, and...

37:37.338 --> 37:39.465
You think that they protect you.

37:39.548 --> 37:42.301
But one day they're
going to get you arrested.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.636
Or even killed.

37:43.719 --> 37:46.681
Lucy got cut for me.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.724
Now I owe them.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.561
(sighing)

37:54.981 --> 37:57.400
GRANDPA ED:
Easy, easy.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.318
Gene Krupa's band
is on the radio,

37:59.402 --> 38:00.903
and she says I have to come in.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.364
{\an1}I want you to see
something, Dad.

38:03.447 --> 38:07.034
I want to get to the hospice
and get settled in.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.328
Turn on some damn lights,
would you?

38:13.791 --> 38:15.334
Merry Christmas, Grandpa.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.712
It's weeks away.

38:17.795 --> 38:18.713
Not in this house.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.048
You're home.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.550
Your room's all ready.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.802
Kiddo, I can't stay with you.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.721
{\an3}Dad.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.389
Mel and I want you to.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.100
I'm not getting any better.

38:31.183 --> 38:32.351
Some days...

38:32.435 --> 38:36.564
Every day is a gift.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.358
I know what I'm taking on.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.402
{\an3}We're going to
do this together.

38:41.485 --> 38:42.737
Whatever you want.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.447
You know what I want.

38:44.530 --> 38:49.285
Yes, when the time
comes, we'll do it.

38:49.368 --> 38:53.414
I wouldn't miss this
for anything.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.709
{\an1}We can wait on the
presents if you want.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.754
Oh, hell, no!

38:59.837 --> 39:02.006
(laughing)

39:09.847 --> 39:11.807
{\an3}For me?

39:16.854 --> 39:18.647
♪ ♪

39:23.027 --> 39:24.320
{\an3}SAMANTHA:
Hi.

39:24.403 --> 39:25.488
Mom.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.448
Here I am. What's up?

39:27.531 --> 39:29.784
I think you should do
David's show.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.827
Steve, I'm not doing the series.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.287
I have nothing to talk about.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.623
Mom, you have an enormous
fan base.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.625
People love you.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.960
I love you.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.047
If I go in there,

39:43.130 --> 39:45.466
my dismissal from the show
will come up.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.801
Whatever.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.302
And the rumors.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.137
{\an1}Be proud of
who you are, Mom.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.388
I am.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.893
{\an1}Come on.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.155
Well, that's my mom.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.490
{\an1}She's gay.
Cool.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.159
{\an3}Go, Mom.
Bartender.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.369
David.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.204
Oh, hey, come on in.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.622
Are you up for this?
Oh, absolutely.

40:16.705 --> 40:17.998
{\an3}Absolutely.
Thank you so much.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.458
{\an3}Here you go, there's
some headphones.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.501
Okay.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.086
{\an3}All set?
Yeah.

40:24.755 --> 40:28.342
Okay, this is,
this is very exciting.

40:28.425 --> 40:32.429
Tonight we have
the extremely talented,

40:32.513 --> 40:35.057
{\an3}the lovely,

40:35.141 --> 40:36.892
the mom you wish you had,

40:36.976 --> 40:39.645
the Hartley House's
own Samantha Sanders.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.567
That's 1,100, 1,150,

40:44.650 --> 40:46.193
{\an1}and you got the
bank check for the rest.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.445
Yeah, cash, check, whatever.

40:52.449 --> 40:55.452
(car door closes, engine starts)

41:17.349 --> 41:18.726
Hey.

41:20.477 --> 41:22.021
Hey.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.564
You sure you're ready
to let something go

41:23.647 --> 41:24.982
that means that much?

41:25.065 --> 41:27.359
Yeah, it's easy.

41:27.443 --> 41:31.030
You just gotta, you know--
one, two, three.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.741
You know, I got
laser surgery today.

41:35.367 --> 41:37.536
Three more visits
and my tattoo's gone.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.914
What inspired you?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.540
You.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.252
I have my car

41:45.336 --> 41:48.047
if you want a ride anywhere.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.965
I'm not going home just yet.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.927
Can I come with you?

41:53.010 --> 41:55.763
It's no place you'd want to be.

41:59.934 --> 42:00.935
Um...

42:02.519 --> 42:05.648
Yeah... does that hurt?

42:07.691 --> 42:08.776
Nothing to it.

42:08.859 --> 42:11.904
Yeah, brave girl.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.764
What are you doing?

42:38.847 --> 42:42.810
I'm burning my wife's ashes.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.480
Dude, you are serious...

42:46.563 --> 42:47.940
Listen, uh,

42:48.023 --> 42:50.359
maybe I got a little
something to help you out.

42:50.442 --> 42:52.319
Highly unlikely.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.154
Nobody comes around here

42:54.238 --> 42:55.864
unless you're looking
for a little...

42:55.948 --> 42:57.324
{\an1}something.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.285
I got some smoke,

42:59.368 --> 43:01.704
rock, got some meth, some smack.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.999
Smack?

43:05.082 --> 43:07.209
You looking for
a little heroin?

43:07.293 --> 43:09.670
Okay.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.672
You wait right here.
