[tires squeal]MAN:
Watch where you're going!

00:22.109 --> 00:23.675
[grunts]Watch it.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.898
[whimpers]

00:32.119 --> 00:34.338
She can't stop me.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.732
I gotta keep moving.
I can't let them find me.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.647
I can't...

00:38.690 --> 00:40.083
[woman panting]

00:40.127 --> 00:41.345
Come on.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.043
Come on.

[people murmuring]

00:46.350 --> 00:47.699
WOMAN 2:
No, wait!

00:47.743 --> 00:48.961
[tires screeching]

01:21.559 --> 01:24.649
No, tell me.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.608
Sweetheart,
I don't get embarrassed.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.915
You little vixen.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.790
I hope you warmed that up first.
[chuckles]

01:34.833 --> 01:35.834
Listen, I gotta go.

01:35.878 --> 01:36.835
Uh, pick you up tonight,

01:36.879 --> 01:37.880
say, 8:00?

01:37.923 --> 01:39.403
Great.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.579
Ciao.

01:41.623 --> 01:45.061
Who's the lucky
little vixen, Tony?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.324
Adult relationship stuff,
McTween.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.196
You wouldn't understand.ZIVA:
Adult relationship?

01:49.239 --> 01:51.198
You?
He must be dating
one of those

01:51.241 --> 01:54.288
late-night chat girls again.She was a student

01:54.331 --> 01:56.028
putting herself
through medical school.

01:56.072 --> 01:59.075
Hmm, I have now
lost my appetite.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.251
Ethel's different.
She's special.

02:01.295 --> 02:04.254
Special Ethel?Good, Tony.
You're finally dating

02:04.298 --> 02:06.561
within your age range.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.911
Happens to be a family name.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.260
And I happen to like it.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.480
It's strong, distinguished.

02:12.523 --> 02:15.483
It says..."I've fallen
and I can't get up"?

02:15.526 --> 02:16.919
[laughing]

02:16.962 --> 02:18.355
Laugh all you want,

02:18.399 --> 02:21.402
but I think Ethel and I really
have something.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.404
Well, there are antibiotics
for that, Tony.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.754
She's even started...

02:25.797 --> 02:27.495
I can share this.

02:27.538 --> 02:31.194
She's even started talking about
role-playing.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.196
You're taking
a drama class?That's not the kind

02:33.240 --> 02:34.328
of role-playing
he's talking about.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.156
Just don't you
show up tomorrow

02:36.199 --> 02:37.809
wearing a diaper
and carrying a whip.

02:37.853 --> 02:40.334
Okay?
Oh, that kind
of role-playing.

02:40.377 --> 02:43.075
So, what is she into?

02:43.119 --> 02:44.686
She's keeping it a secret
till Halloween.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.817
Says it's gonna bring

02:45.861 --> 02:47.471
our relationship
to a whole new level.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.039
Well, what if she wants you to
dress up like a ballerina?

02:50.082 --> 02:51.301
[Tony chuckles]

02:51.345 --> 02:53.608
Well, trust me.
This woman could get Gibbs

02:53.651 --> 02:56.176
into a tutu and a leotard
if she wanted to.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.352
Not likely, in this lifetime,
DiNozzo.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.223
No, boss. I'm sure you would
never wear a leotard.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.921
But if you did,
you could pull it off.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.272
I'm gonna grab my gear.Good idea.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.969
Got a dead Navy lieutenant.
Let's go.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.497
Heck of a way to catch a bus.

03:13.541 --> 03:16.500
So, boss, uh, police
think it was an accident.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.328
Bus driver claims
that the, uh,

03:18.372 --> 03:20.374
victim tried to run
the light and missed.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.984
Got an I.D.?Yeah.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.116
Navy Lieutenant
Clea Thorson.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.858
29 years old.
Chemical engineer.

03:26.902 --> 03:30.035
Two tours overseas before
joining the Reserves in 2006.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.124
I have a witness that says
the victim was acting

03:32.168 --> 03:34.257
paranoid prior to the collision.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.346
Police have another who says
she was mumbling to herself

03:36.390 --> 03:37.956
about trying to get
away from someone.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.523
Mental problems?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.656
Maybe she really was
running away from someone.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.875
Good morning, all.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.095
To whom do we have
the privilege?

03:46.138 --> 03:48.271
Navy Lieutenant
Clea Thorson.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.013
Pedestrian versus bus.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.450
How unfortunate.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.538
Walk on the green,
not in-between.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.716
I am so sorry.
I-I used to say that

03:58.760 --> 04:01.284
to myself, uh, when I
was a kid whenever
I wandered into...

04:01.328 --> 04:03.895
Never mind.
Never mind.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.550
DUCKY:
Severe trauma to the head
consistent with a collision.

04:06.594 --> 04:10.032
The impact threw the victim

04:10.075 --> 04:12.339
12 to 15 feet, making the speed

04:12.382 --> 04:15.211
of the bus at the point
of collision...?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.300
Uh...15 to 20 miles an hour.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.652
Are those scratches
on her hands, Mr. Palmer?

04:23.872 --> 04:25.700
Naturally, she would have

04:25.743 --> 04:27.789
extended her arms
to protect herself.

04:27.832 --> 04:31.706
Oh, this is weird.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.927
GIBBS:
Palmer?

04:35.971 --> 04:37.277
Check the other arm.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.339
McGEE:
Some kind of chemical symbols?

04:56.383 --> 05:00.430
Looks like my cheat sheet from
an eighth grade math final.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.867
DUCKY:
Whatever this is, Mr. Palmer,

05:02.911 --> 05:06.175
I am certain that you did not
learn it in eighth grade.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.753
TONY:
Seems Lieutenant Thorson was
something of an overachiever.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.712
Background.Graduated first in
her class from MIT.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.324
While she was in the service,
she led a civil engineering

05:24.367 --> 05:27.152
project to rebuild water
systems in Iraq.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.677
She was 21.Recruited by every
biotech firm in the country.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.679
She chose
Martin Stillwell's

05:31.722 --> 05:34.203
Gen-1 Biotech, Inc. in DC.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.422
She was working on

05:35.465 --> 05:37.119
a research project there
until two weeks ago.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.382
Fired. We're not sure why.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.384
A spotless military record.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.299
Family?Never married.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.867
No children.
No boyfriend to speak of.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.738
Only relative
is her mother in Boston.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.045
She's in the air as we speak.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.786
Well, boss, no current home
address in the database.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.832
Most recent is from
about six months ago.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.486
No cell phone or credit card
trails, either.

05:56.530 --> 06:00.229
But I did find a bank account
registered to her in Maryland.

06:00.272 --> 06:04.886
She made several recent
deposits-- all over $20,000,

06:04.929 --> 06:08.150
and all within
the last two weeks.After Stillwell fired her.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.847
Could've been working
for someone on the sly.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.196
Find out who was paying her.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.070
I really appreciate you guys
letting me do this.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.857
I mean, don't get me wrong,
Tony's pictures are great.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.685
I just... I need specifics.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.428
Oddly Diane Arbus to me.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.256
Wow, I love her.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.085
I'll take that
as a compliment.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.827
How great is "Child With Toy
Grenade in Central Park"?

06:32.870 --> 06:34.263
Mmm, I worship "Triplets
in Their Bedroom."

06:34.306 --> 06:36.134
Totally!

06:36.178 --> 06:38.485
I worship getting my work done.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.660
Abby? Psh!

06:39.703 --> 06:42.358
Holy mother of Einstein!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.664
[sighs]

06:47.711 --> 06:50.932
There's a pattern here.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.237
I would love to know what it is.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.414
Ah, Jethro.
Thank goodness.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.893
Never seen anything like
this before, Gibbs.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.199
I'm not sure
exactly what it is.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.593
Did she write it,
or did someone else do it?

06:59.636 --> 07:02.726
I don't know that
yet, either.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.337
It's just... it's an...
indecipherable puzzle.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.862
That's what makes it
so cool.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.951
My point is, it's gonna take me

07:09.994 --> 07:11.822
a while to process
all this, so...

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
Right.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.524
Off I go. Bye.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.439
Bye, Abbs.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.267
I'm afraid we're not
finished yet, Jethro.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.140
But what I've discovered
so far really bothers me.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.272
Broken capillaries
in both eyes.

07:27.316 --> 07:30.754
Her skin is
extremely dehydrated.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.364
Both of these are unrelated

07:32.408 --> 07:36.281
to the blunt force trauma
she incurred at the accident.

07:36.325 --> 07:39.937
This was a very sick
woman, Jethro.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.462
Mr. Palmer, would you...?

07:42.505 --> 07:45.595
Her spleen expanded to nearly
twice its size.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.903
The liver and pancreas
are also enlarged.

07:48.946 --> 07:52.036
She had almost
complete organ failure.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.648
From what?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.127
Some kind of poison.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.653
I have no idea what kind.
Abby will start tests.

07:59.696 --> 08:04.266
But whatever it was, it's been
in her system for some time.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.007
She was dying.

08:06.050 --> 08:11.534
I-I have no idea how the
poison got into her system.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.970
It didn't get there by itself.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.495
Whoever did this to her

08:15.538 --> 08:19.020
knew just what to do
not to get caught.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.327
Come on, DiNozzo,
give me something.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.460
Uh, no luck on the
money trail, boss.McGee?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.941
Found several IM's in
Thorson's e-mail cache.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.290
One's video.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.772
You ungrateful bitch.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.121
You're not going anywhere.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.906
And if you do leave me,

08:35.950 --> 08:38.605
I will make your life hell!

08:38.648 --> 08:40.781
Wow. Mel Gibson much?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.522
Huh. There was no evidence

08:42.565 --> 08:43.697
that Lieutenant Thorson
had a boyfriend.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.915
McGee?

08:44.959 --> 08:46.090
Yep, finding the IP address.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.052
Okay, uh, this is not

08:51.095 --> 08:53.707
her boyfriend;
that's her boss.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.797
STILLWELL: You know, you're out
of your mind if you think

08:56.840 --> 08:59.582
I had something to do
with Clea's death.No, actually, you are.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.105
We got the video message
to prove it.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.500
Easy, tiger.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.025
Guy could go a little nuts
after getting dumped, huh?

09:08.069 --> 09:10.506
Clea and I had a
professional relationship.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.421
That's it.

09:12.464 --> 09:15.293
I gave her her break in this
business; I nurtured her.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.121
So, you don't deny
you were close?

09:17.165 --> 09:19.341
About the work? Yes.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.038
You see, Clea was the most
brilliant engineer

09:21.082 --> 09:22.997
I'd ever known
and ever worked with.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.303
But of course, what comes along
with all that brilliance are

09:25.347 --> 09:27.262
certain... challenges.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.916
What kind of challenges?

09:28.959 --> 09:30.918
Clea never wanted
to be a team player.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.224
She had to do everything
on her own in her own way,

09:33.268 --> 09:34.791
and that's not how
I run things here.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.228
She'd also become
impossible to deal with,

09:37.272 --> 09:40.188
especially during our
research project at Norfolk.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.581
Can you explain
this research project?

09:41.624 --> 09:44.845
My company was hired by the
Navy to help them become

09:44.888 --> 09:47.238
fuel independent--
to go green, if you will.Well, no more dependence

09:47.282 --> 09:49.589
on foreign oil-- I like
the sound of that.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.155
Well, essentially,
the goal

09:51.199 --> 09:53.027
was to make sure
every Naval base

09:53.070 --> 09:55.377
was completely off
the grid by 2020.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.683
Well, that sounds like

09:56.726 --> 09:58.119
a large undertaking.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.600
Uh, it's massive,
actually.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.558
Hi. And you are...?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.473
April Ferris.
I'm an engineer

10:04.516 --> 10:06.170
here at Gen-1.

10:06.214 --> 10:09.739
Engineer... so you worked
with Clea Thorson, then?

10:09.783 --> 10:12.742
I did, for five years.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.352
She was a friend.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.443
It's awful what happened.It is.

10:18.487 --> 10:21.142
Can you tell us about
her last days here

10:21.185 --> 10:22.534
before she was... fired?

10:22.578 --> 10:24.536
I'm sorry.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.191
I can't right now. I've got a
meeting that I need to get to.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.717
And of course, any
other questions can be
answered by my attorney.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.196
We're not done yet.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.329
I believe we are.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.335
Who did this?

10:40.378 --> 10:42.816
Who killed my daughter?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.950
Was she in any trouble?

10:46.994 --> 10:51.128
Everything was fine.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.914
Clea was just fine.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.438
Until she lost her job.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.701
Any idea why?

10:58.745 --> 11:01.008
No.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.444
But she kept sending money,

11:02.487 --> 11:05.665
telling me to keep it
in case anything happened.

11:05.708 --> 11:09.538
She was scared.

11:09.581 --> 11:13.281
At first, I thought
it was the meds,

11:13.324 --> 11:17.328
but this was different.

11:17.372 --> 11:20.288
Meds.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.726
Started when
she was about four.

11:23.770 --> 11:24.945
Mood swings,

11:24.988 --> 11:29.558
manic behavior, insomnia.

11:29.601 --> 11:33.518
She struggled
till her early teens.

11:36.304 --> 11:40.264
Then we found the right doctor,
the right medications,

11:40.308 --> 11:43.790
and everything
was under control.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.356
Until recently.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.971
That had to be hard.

11:52.146 --> 11:56.367
Something... had my daughter

11:56.411 --> 11:59.849
shaken up, Agent Gibbs.

11:59.893 --> 12:03.331
And I don't think
it was her illness.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.339
Do you have children?

12:17.911 --> 12:20.870
Did.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.655
Please tell me
the pain goes away.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.230
I've been going over
the photos I took in autopsy.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.797
See how the writing

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
on the left arm is similar to

12:36.843 --> 12:38.235
that on the right,
but it's angled funny?

12:38.279 --> 12:40.847
It's two different people.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.631
No, not people.

12:42.674 --> 12:43.632
Hands.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.895
Her own hands.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.114
Ambidextrous.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.812
If the killer did this,

12:49.856 --> 12:52.815
then the handwriting would be
exactly the same on both arms.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.599
She wrote it
all herself.

12:54.643 --> 12:55.600
How's that for dedication?

12:55.644 --> 12:58.821
I'm officially a fan.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.214
There's more.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.476
[typing]

13:03.870 --> 13:06.481
It's a formula.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.787
Or it's pieces

13:07.830 --> 13:11.921
of-of a longer, elaborate
chemical formula.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.141
I just don't know
what it is yet.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.316
And I'm stumped.

13:15.359 --> 13:16.578
You want to know why?

13:16.621 --> 13:19.102
'Cause it's a code
inside a code.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.409
And it was written so only
she could understand it.

13:21.452 --> 13:22.976
This is pure
brilliance

13:23.019 --> 13:24.020
with a capital B.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.761
Or with a capital P.B.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.808
It's just one part
of a bigger equation.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.027
She did this
for a reason.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.115
She wanted to
protect it.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.551
Look.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.381
[typing]

13:37.425 --> 13:38.905
See these little numbers

13:38.948 --> 13:40.471
written in the
crease of her elbow?

13:42.865 --> 13:43.823
Coordinates.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.824
Yeah.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.260
[typing]

13:47.435 --> 13:49.741
Ding, ding, ding.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.657
1649 Delaney Street Southeast.Thanks.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.272
Someone was
security conscious.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.927
Or paranoid.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.645
Maybe paranoid
for a reason, huh?

14:35.309 --> 14:37.050
We should get Abby out here.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.926
You should see
this, Tony.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.545
Left us a message.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.861
[camera shutter clicking]

15:14.478 --> 15:16.828
ZIVA:
I am a little concerned.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.700
I have never seen Abby so...

15:18.743 --> 15:20.006
Quiet.

15:20.049 --> 15:23.096
She's fine.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.011
She's just thinking.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.274
ZIVA:
I admit,

15:27.317 --> 15:28.579
it's a lot to absorb.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.667
Could take us
weeks to process.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.976
I've already counted
three security cameras inside.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.326
Should be able to
get whoever was

15:36.370 --> 15:38.241
in here on playback.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.721
If somebody was in here.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.592
I sense skepticism, Tony.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.203
Well, you sensed right,
Dr. Phil.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.122
Think it's the same formula?

15:49.165 --> 15:50.601
McGee, hi. Yes.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.125
I mean, no, no.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.126
It's not the same.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.866
Well, part of it is.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.740
This is actually an extension
of what's on her body.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.308
This is the second piece
of the formula.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.050
Just-- I've never seen

16:04.093 --> 16:07.444
someone so focused before.

16:07.488 --> 16:08.750
Oh, I have.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.321
In a good
way, I mean.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.932
Talking about
you, Abbs.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
Go. Shoo.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.414
I have to check
the hard drive.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.460
Okay.

16:23.504 --> 16:27.377
Ziva, anything here?

16:27.421 --> 16:29.597
Well, Lieutenant Thorson
was definitely

16:29.640 --> 16:31.251
having problems
with Stillwell. Look.

16:31.294 --> 16:34.036
She writes that he was
watching her every move.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.255
What about the
Norfolk project?

16:35.298 --> 16:36.908
Nothing.

16:36.952 --> 16:40.651
Maybe Stillwell had her
too scared to write about it.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.002
Maybe Alice took a few
too many pills in Wonderland.

16:43.045 --> 16:43.785
[pills rattle]

16:43.828 --> 16:46.440
Hey, bite your tongue.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.529
Respect,

16:48.572 --> 16:49.573
please.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.358
Sorry, Abbs, I
just think we need

16:51.401 --> 16:53.099
to consider the possibility that

16:53.142 --> 16:54.448
Lieutenant Thorson's

16:54.491 --> 16:56.580
paranoia was imagined.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.323
Her hard drive's been erased.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.283
Is that a euphemism?

17:03.326 --> 17:04.327
They used a remote device

17:04.371 --> 17:05.981
to erase the hard drive.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.156
I don't think that

17:07.200 --> 17:08.375
is imagined.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.550
Someone was stealing her work.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.208
TONY:
Well, boss, say hello
to the Green Hornet.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.124
The first F-18
jet fueled by

17:18.167 --> 17:20.691
50% biofuel.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.737
Tested off the charts
last spring.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.565
Stillwell's company involved?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.306
Yeah, his and about 20 others.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.437
The Navy's investing billions.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.482
Check it out.

17:28.525 --> 17:29.831
Thermonuclear power,

17:29.874 --> 17:30.962
wind energy,

17:31.006 --> 17:33.356
geothermal power,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.663
hybrid ships--
you name it.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.404
Companies are in a race to
patent new technologies.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.320
Yeah, and whoever gets the
patents first makes a fortune.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.452
Oh, yeah.
Daddy Warbucks kind of fortune.

17:42.496 --> 17:46.065
Thorson's project could've been
worth enough to get her killed.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.762
Hmm.

17:47.805 --> 17:48.893
Money trail.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.678
McGEE:
All deposits were
strictly cash.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.594
Whoever was paying her
did not want to be found.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.161
Prints in the loft.
Just hers.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.771
Nothing off the security
camera footage either.

17:56.814 --> 18:00.122
Only person I've seen
so far is her.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.472
Time codes begin
the day she was fired

18:02.516 --> 18:03.952
and end the day she died.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.957
She locked herself away
for two weeks.

18:09.000 --> 18:09.871
She was dedicated to her cause.

18:10.611 --> 18:11.525
TONY:
Hey.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.141
Obsessive.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.795
ZIVA:
Now, Gibbs, I've found

18:20.838 --> 18:24.015
references to a Mr. K.
in her journals,

18:24.059 --> 18:26.192
as well as entries
of meetings in a calendar.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.150
Any dates?
Yeah.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.717
Several in the past two weeks.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.848
Find him.

18:30.892 --> 18:34.069
Check employees
at Stillwell's company,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.593
Navy colleagues, anyone linked
to this Norfolk project.

18:40.554 --> 18:44.253
ABBY:
I can see a kindred spirit
in you.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.474
I mean, not that I can
see your spirit,

18:47.517 --> 18:49.345
'cause that would be weird.

18:49.389 --> 18:53.828
But I guess not too weird
'cause you're in here,

18:53.871 --> 18:57.048
and you're, you know, you're...

18:57.092 --> 18:59.573
[clears throat]

18:59.616 --> 19:03.707
Um, anyway, uh, so what
I'm trying to say is-is

19:03.751 --> 19:06.493
we communicate in the same way.

19:06.536 --> 19:10.018
I could tell the first time
I saw all of this.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.284
Everyone else saw chaos,
and I-I saw patterns right away.

19:15.328 --> 19:18.896
There was order to the chaos.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.909
So... I just, I want you to know

19:31.953 --> 19:35.913
that whatever it is...

19:35.957 --> 19:38.481
that you're trying to tell me,

19:38.525 --> 19:41.223
I promise you,

19:41.267 --> 19:44.313
I promise I'll understand.

19:44.357 --> 19:45.575
DUCKY:
Careful.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.273
Sometimes they
talk back.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.491
Ducky.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.798
Hi.

19:50.841 --> 19:55.237
I just, I wanted to get one last
look at the-the writings.

19:55.281 --> 19:59.937
It's a rather
fascinating case

19:59.981 --> 20:02.766
with a rather
fascinating young woman.

20:02.810 --> 20:05.682
We could study her
brain for years

20:05.726 --> 20:10.209
and never know just
what made her tick.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.167
[chuckles]

20:12.211 --> 20:16.084
But, I suppose, that could
be said for any one of us.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.783
You all right?

20:19.827 --> 20:23.004
You look a
little peaked.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.702
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

20:25.746 --> 20:26.703
Go home, Abby.

20:26.747 --> 20:27.704
Get some rest.

20:27.748 --> 20:31.969
I can assure you
of one thing:

20:32.013 --> 20:34.624
Lieutenant Thorson will
still be here in the morning.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.815
McGee! You're here.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.295
I've had some
breakthroughs.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.862
Or maybe it's
more like

20:54.905 --> 20:56.951
some little bursts
of inspiration.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.518
'Cause if I had a
breakthrough, that would mean

20:58.561 --> 21:00.650
I have all the answers,
but I don't, not yet.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.957
But I'm close. I know I
am, because I can feel it.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.524
I've got, like, this
tingling feeling

21:04.567 --> 21:05.829
going up and
down my spine.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.353
How many Caf-POWs
you had today?

21:07.396 --> 21:09.093
Um, eleven-teen.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.052
Did you even go home last night?

21:11.095 --> 21:12.836
I've been inputting the
raw data from the writings,

21:12.880 --> 21:14.098
trying to
crack the code

21:14.142 --> 21:16.840
to the formula,
and then bam, it hit me.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.494
That it's not
about the code.

21:18.538 --> 21:19.495
It's about her.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.715
What I need to crack is her.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.413
The DTA bus line--
she rode it every week.

21:24.457 --> 21:27.068
It's all in here.

21:27.111 --> 21:29.766
And she wrote about
a-a college mentor.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.682
I don't know where he is, but
I think he was her confidant.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.250
And maybe he could
tell us about Mr. K.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.861
And you think we
should find him?

21:37.905 --> 21:40.516
Lieutenant Thorson--
she had a whole life,

21:40.560 --> 21:42.692
out there somewhere.

21:42.736 --> 21:43.737
She was on a journey.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.347
And it's my duty to follow it.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.131
That's how we're gonna
find out who killed her.

21:47.175 --> 21:51.048
I can't do it alone,
McGee.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.441
I need you to come with me.

21:55.401 --> 21:59.230
ZIVA:
3:00 in the afternoon,
she has a sandwich and a soda.

21:59.274 --> 22:03.191
Exactly 20 minutes later,
she goes back to her desk.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.587
6:00 in the evening,

22:07.630 --> 22:09.197
she takes a shower.

22:09.240 --> 22:13.027
Same every day,
like clockwork.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.421
[groans]

22:15.464 --> 22:17.858
I know that sound.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.992
What sound?
I didn't make a sound.

22:22.036 --> 22:26.562
It is the sound of things not
boding well for poor Ethel.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.521
I don't want to talk about it.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.826
What's wrong?

22:29.870 --> 22:31.001
Are you having second thoughts

22:31.045 --> 22:32.046
about the role
you're going to play?

22:32.089 --> 22:33.047
She wants me

22:33.090 --> 22:34.570
to dress up like...

22:34.614 --> 22:38.182
No, I can't.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.749
It's sacrilege.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.186
I'm gonna have to end it.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.972
Oh, come on, Tony,
it's only been two days.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.495
It's too short...

22:46.539 --> 22:48.367
even for you.
Trust me, Ziva.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.543
There's some things
a man should never do.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.805
We're are not talking
about a man here.

22:51.848 --> 22:52.849
We're talking about you.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.547
Did you let her know?

22:54.590 --> 22:58.942
I need some time to process.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.815
If you are going
to end it, do it now.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.600
It is not fair to just...

23:04.644 --> 23:06.428
Tony, what is this?

23:06.472 --> 23:08.735
Miss Ferris. She called.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.476
I told her to come in.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.609
Hi. Does Stillwell know
you're here?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.394
No.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.961
Keeps everyone around him on
a pretty tight leash, huh?

23:18.005 --> 23:19.963
In some ways, yes.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.052
What about Lieutenant Thorson?

23:22.096 --> 23:24.054
Their relationship
was very complicated.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.708
And that's all I'll say.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.754
What about your relationship
with her?

23:27.797 --> 23:30.626
We were the only women engineers
at Gen-1.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.715
She was a lot braver
than I was.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.587
How so?

23:34.630 --> 23:37.067
She wasn't afraid to stand up
to Martin or anyone else.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.593
I only wish
I had known her better.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.813
And how her mind worked. I...

23:49.079 --> 23:52.343
Uh, these are some
of the things from
her locker.

23:52.387 --> 23:54.041
Maybe you'll be able

23:54.084 --> 23:57.479
to find some of the answers
I never could.

23:57.523 --> 24:01.744
All right. We'll be in touch.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.097
Who was that?

24:07.141 --> 24:09.622
Lieutenant Thorson's
colleague.

24:09.665 --> 24:10.623
You get anything?

24:10.666 --> 24:13.713
Yes.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.497
I think we did.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.933
A final meeting

24:16.977 --> 24:18.369
with "Mr. K."

24:18.413 --> 24:20.546
This one's scheduled
for later this afternoon.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.809
You got a location?

24:22.852 --> 24:25.725
Wiley's Cafe across town.

24:25.768 --> 24:26.856
ABBY:
The 35 should take us

24:26.900 --> 24:28.467
to 16th Street.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.685
From there we can
take the Red Line
to DuPont Circle.

24:29.729 --> 24:32.383
Okay, Abby, we have been
on five buses

24:32.427 --> 24:34.429
in the last two hours, okay?
This isn't working.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.300
I need to find what
I'm looking for, McGee.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.086
Yeah, but you don't even know
what you're looking for.

24:39.129 --> 24:43.264
I mean, at least be pragmatic.
Listen to yourself.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.876
Clea took this path
all the time.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.748
I have find out why.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.445
I thought you wanted
to help me.

24:52.273 --> 24:56.146
Abby, I do want
to help you. I... Whoa!

25:08.985 --> 25:11.640
McGEE:
Bringing up the cell grid.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.733
No hits where
I last saw Abby.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.518
She must have turned
her cell phone off.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.302
She didn't just disappear
into thin air, Tim.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.913
I know, boss.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.306
We'll find her.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.500
How did you know where
to find me?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.893
I followed
Lieutenant Thorson's path.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.634
It only took me
eight different buses

25:48.677 --> 25:50.810
and ten miles
on foot to do it.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.725
Knowing Clea,
she had a reason.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.117
She was scared,

25:54.161 --> 25:55.597
Professor Redner.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.164
Someone was following her.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.382
The same person that hurt her?

26:00.471 --> 26:01.908
I was worried
something had happened

26:01.951 --> 26:03.605
when she didn't show
the other day.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.434
So...

26:06.477 --> 26:09.785
she was on her way to
see you when she died.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.876
I can't believe that she's gone.

26:15.922 --> 26:19.360
Well, I don't think she is.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.884
I mean, not totally.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.233
Look at this.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.630
Okay,

26:28.674 --> 26:30.893
she left all
this behind.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.895
Do you have any idea
what this means?

26:35.028 --> 26:38.640
Well, there's a
focus on hydrogen,

26:38.684 --> 26:41.991
carbon dioxide,

26:42.035 --> 26:45.168
but the rest I don't,
I don't recognize.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.388
She kept her own
projects secret,

26:47.431 --> 26:49.259
even from me.

26:49.303 --> 26:51.435
She-she had to have shared
something with you.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.698
She trusted you.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.309
She wrote
about a "Mr. K."

26:55.352 --> 26:57.180
She mentioned him
a few times, yes.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.355
Ever by his full name?

26:58.399 --> 27:00.227
No.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.184
Sorry.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.103
You know, Clea gave me
something a few years ago.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.672
We would read from it

27:10.716 --> 27:12.152
during her visits.

27:12.195 --> 27:15.634
It seemed to calm her.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.766
Maybe it can do the
same thing for you.

27:21.422 --> 27:23.424
Oh, I-I couldn't take that.

27:23.467 --> 27:24.904
That was a gift.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.993
Science is poetry,
Ms. Sciuto.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.690
It's about making order...

27:28.734 --> 27:29.865
From chaos.

27:29.909 --> 27:32.868
Yeah, that's what
I do every day.

27:32.912 --> 27:35.088
Then this book is in good hands.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.402
We are not sure
what to believe
at this point.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.796
The meeting with Mr. K. wasn't
quite what we hoped for.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.276
He never showed?You could say that.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.581
Well, the restaurant
manager confirmed

27:50.625 --> 27:51.713
Lieutenant Thorson
was there

27:51.757 --> 27:53.410
many times these
past two weeks.

27:53.454 --> 27:56.413
Dates correspond to meetings
found in her calendar. Look.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.459
TONY:
We got video footage.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.853
Let's see it.

28:03.072 --> 28:06.162
TONY:
At first I thought maybe
she was on her phone,

28:06.206 --> 28:08.295
but manager says that
she stays like this

28:08.338 --> 28:10.297
for about an hour
every time.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.561
He kicked her out after
a customer complained

28:13.604 --> 28:14.997
that she was getting too loud.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.308
Turn it off.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.353
Boss, Abby's turned
her cell phone back on.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.921
I'm gonna try and nail down
her exact location.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.618
Last time we let you two
out on a field trip.

28:27.662 --> 28:29.577
GIBBS:
DiNozzo.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.319
Is that Thorson meeting with...

28:32.362 --> 28:33.494
The notorious Mr. K.?

28:33.537 --> 28:35.757
Yes, it is.
In the flesh, so to speak.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.933
Who's gonna tell Abby?

28:37.977 --> 28:38.760
I nominate you.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.721
I'll handle it.

28:42.764 --> 28:46.028
Well, someone will have
to and quickly.

28:48.814 --> 28:49.989
Abby, are you all right?

28:50.032 --> 28:51.512
Gibbs, whirlwind of a day!

28:51.555 --> 28:52.818
You wouldn't believe
where I've been.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.733
You want to guess?
Go for it.
Abby...

28:54.776 --> 28:55.777
Okay, I'll tell you.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.692
So, I found

28:57.736 --> 28:59.346
Lieutenant Thorson's college
mentor, Professor Daniel Redner.

28:59.389 --> 29:00.434
He's a great guy.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.175
We talked about poetry,
he made tea.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.785
I loved the poetry,
I hated the tea.

29:03.829 --> 29:04.917
Stop.
Anyways,

29:04.960 --> 29:06.570
he knows all about Mr. K.

29:06.614 --> 29:10.270
And he said that Thorson was
really secretive about him,

29:10.313 --> 29:12.011
which means that
she felt threatened by him.

29:12.054 --> 29:13.795
So we have
to find Mr. K., Gibbs!

29:13.839 --> 29:15.971
Stop!

29:17.712 --> 29:19.540
You just raised
your voice to me.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.020
You never raise
your voice to me.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.469
It's her delusion, Abbs.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.736
I was wrong...

29:43.390 --> 29:45.914
...about you.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.788
You don't understand.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.267
None of you understand!

29:56.011 --> 29:57.621
GIBBS:
There's no reasoning with her.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.188
I'm afraid not, Jethro.

29:59.232 --> 30:01.451
Not when she locks
herself in her lab,

30:01.495 --> 30:05.760
convinced that she can find
all the answers on her own.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.198
Right. Just like Thorson did.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.852
Well, there's no doubt that Abby
greatly identifies

30:10.896 --> 30:11.853
with the lieutenant.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.812
Has done from the beginning.

30:13.855 --> 30:16.118
It's a slippery slope, Duck.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.293
Yeah. Well, as
Nietzsche says,

30:17.337 --> 30:19.339
"When you gaze long
into the abyss,

30:19.382 --> 30:21.689
the abyss will gaze into you."

30:21.732 --> 30:23.865
I need to get her back.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.520
You will.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.348
We're still waiting results
from the outside lab

30:28.391 --> 30:29.871
as to the type of poison.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.394
However, this morning

30:31.438 --> 30:33.701
I pulled a piece of tissue

30:33.744 --> 30:35.659
from beneath one
of Thorson's fingernails.

30:35.703 --> 30:38.010
There a fight?

30:38.053 --> 30:40.012
It could have been
a nasty one.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.275
The tissue was deeply imbedded.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.059
You got an I.D.?

30:47.889 --> 30:49.108
Just got that back.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.507
TONY:
Boss, it's Stillwell.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.335
[engine starting]

31:02.121 --> 31:03.209
Get out of the car, Stillwell!

31:04.819 --> 31:06.168
Get out!

31:06.995 --> 31:09.215
He's on the move!

31:09.258 --> 31:10.607
[gasping]

31:10.651 --> 31:11.608
Help me!

31:11.652 --> 31:14.307
[grunts]

31:14.350 --> 31:15.874
[people nearby clamoring]

31:24.534 --> 31:27.059
Gibbs?

31:27.102 --> 31:30.018
Ducky's initial
autopsy findings
point to poison.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.280
Same way Thorson was killed.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.934
GIBBS:
Same killer.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.196
Well, you know what?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.328
Maybe Thorson wasn't
completely insane.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.764
I mean, boss,
we know that

31:36.807 --> 31:38.200
Thorson and Stillwell were both
working to redesign

31:38.244 --> 31:40.115
energy systems for the Navy.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.291
Billions are at stake.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.685
Maybe Thorson's formula really
is the key to all of this.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.382
Well, then,
if that is true

31:46.426 --> 31:49.211
then Abby's the only one
who can make this breakthrough.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.386
Somebody's gotta break through
her first.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.910
Think I might know someone.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.870
No matter where I was,

31:55.914 --> 31:59.308
I could always tell
when Clea was in trouble.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.093
My stomach got twisted up.

32:01.136 --> 32:05.314
I didn't sleep.
Didn't eat.

32:05.358 --> 32:08.535
I knew something was wrong,
but I never expected this.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.885
She had a mission.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.843
Nothing was gonna stop her.

32:12.887 --> 32:16.195
From what I hear,
you feel the same way.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.848
Well, I promised your daughter

32:17.892 --> 32:19.981
that I would finish
what she started.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.461
At what cost, Ms. Sciuto?

32:25.813 --> 32:27.902
Clea was a scientist

32:27.946 --> 32:29.556
above all else.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.340
Her work fed her.

32:31.384 --> 32:34.126
Gave her the happiness
I never could,

32:34.169 --> 32:36.867
but it also drove
her to the brink.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.739
I'm not on the brink.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.610
I'm just looking for answers.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.308
Where?

32:42.351 --> 32:44.136
In my daughter's head?

32:44.179 --> 32:48.967
I'd do anything to tell
you how Clea's mind worked,

32:49.010 --> 32:50.794
but after 29 years
and all the love

32:50.838 --> 32:53.623
a mother could possibly give,
not even I can tell you that.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.454
You connected
to my daughter

32:58.498 --> 33:00.456
because of science.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.632
Yes.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.373
And you want
to help her?

33:05.809 --> 33:08.290
That's all I want to do.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.989
Then do what she
would have done,

33:11.032 --> 33:14.253
and put emotion aside.

33:14.296 --> 33:18.431
Please, you have to let her go.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.914
Progress, Gibbs.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.438
Observe progress.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.005
Music to my ears, Abbs.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.789
Okay, after whittling
away at the mass

33:28.832 --> 33:30.356
of symbols and letters,
I kept coming back

33:30.399 --> 33:32.010
to two distinct chemical
compositions.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.098
The first was taken

33:33.141 --> 33:35.100
from the writings
on the body.

33:35.143 --> 33:38.059
It happens to be a unique
construction of the
bacteria E Coli.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.148
Right. Sorry.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.584
Inside voice.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.456
It just feels really good
to have my mojo back.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.849
Okay, now behold the
second composition.

33:45.893 --> 33:49.418
It was found in the writings
inside Thorson's loft.

33:49.462 --> 33:52.073
And it is--
drumroll please--

33:52.117 --> 33:54.945
a synthesis of compounds
with the aid of radiant energy.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.339
A.K.A. photosynthesis.

33:57.383 --> 34:01.082
Wait. So this is all about
plants and bad meat?

34:01.126 --> 34:02.257
Yeah, it's confusing, huh?

34:02.301 --> 34:03.998
Okay, next equation, stat.
I mean please.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.046
At first

34:08.089 --> 34:09.699
I thought this was about

34:09.743 --> 34:12.528
converting the organisms
of E Coli into fuel,

34:12.572 --> 34:14.139
but there's too much
carbon dioxide

34:14.182 --> 34:15.662
for that process to ever work.

34:15.705 --> 34:19.883
In other words, my mojo
has sort of hit a no-jo.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.929
I still don't have the last
piece of the formula.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.235
I feel like I'm
missing something,

34:23.278 --> 34:25.411
but I've been over
this a million times.

34:25.454 --> 34:26.803
This is our anomaly, boss.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.414
And we still can't figure out

34:28.457 --> 34:30.111
where it fits
in the formula.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.547
Looks like a plant.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.726
It's not a plant, Gibbs.

34:37.858 --> 34:39.512
It's a leaf.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.827
McGEE:
A memory card.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.407
Whoa, guys.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.583
Clea Thorson was a genius.

35:07.627 --> 35:10.020
Carbon dioxide
wasn't the problem--

35:10.064 --> 35:11.674
it was the solution.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.676
She discovered a way
to make fuel

35:13.720 --> 35:15.200
from bacteria.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.594
This is revolutionary
for green energy.

35:18.638 --> 35:21.206
I mean, she's figured out
how to power the planet

35:21.249 --> 35:23.295
out of stuff that
we try to get rid of.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.036
GIBBS:
Avaxis employee list.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.652
Systems director

35:32.695 --> 35:34.610
Rupert Kritzer.

35:34.654 --> 35:37.352
Ha! I told you there
was a Mr. K.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.965
Yes, she was
working for me.

35:42.009 --> 35:44.794
You paid her under
the table. Why?

35:44.838 --> 35:46.927
It's a cutthroat business.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.669
It's the way it
has to be done.

35:49.712 --> 35:52.976
Keep it hidden
from Stillwell?

35:53.020 --> 35:55.370
I know you were working
on the Navy energy plan.

35:55.414 --> 36:00.245
And I know that he was one
of your main competitors.

36:00.288 --> 36:01.550
It's complicated.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.030
Well, yeah.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.859
Two people are dead and
you're the chief suspect.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.774
[chuckles]

36:07.817 --> 36:09.167
Doesn't get much more
complicated than that.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.914
Look, the biotech business

36:17.958 --> 36:21.179
is this generation's
dot-com boom, okay?

36:21.222 --> 36:24.704
Everyone is trying to discover
the next big thing.

36:24.747 --> 36:27.533
And everyone is looking
for the next big talent.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.188
Talent like
Lieutenant Thorson?

36:30.231 --> 36:31.624
Right. So when
Stillwell fired her,

36:31.667 --> 36:34.888
I pounced, okay?

36:34.931 --> 36:36.629
I told her to keep
it to herself.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.021
He'd stolen ideas
from me before.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.328
I wasn't going to let
him do that again.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.286
I didn't want our project

36:41.329 --> 36:43.244
ever getting back to him.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.333
Yeah, and when it did,
you killed them.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.857
Had to keep it
for yourself.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.082
I didn't kill anyone.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.827
I don't believe you.

37:00.870 --> 37:04.483
Clea's bacteria
conversion formula

37:04.526 --> 37:07.660
has just netted me $2 billion,

37:07.703 --> 37:09.052
Agent Gibbs.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.838
I was just about to hire
her for a second project.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.144
Why would I want her dead?

37:17.539 --> 37:20.499
Martin Stillwell's throat
was burned from swallowing

37:20.542 --> 37:22.805
a significant amount
of something.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.808
So much, in fact,
that you can still smell it.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.421
[sniffs]

37:29.464 --> 37:30.987
Gasoline.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.815
Dead bodies.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.426
Close.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.385
It's a highly refined
version of ethanol

37:37.429 --> 37:40.649
mixed with traces
of formaldehyde.

37:40.693 --> 37:41.998
Where would somebody
get something like that?

37:42.042 --> 37:42.956
They can't.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.653
Mr. Palmer.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.786
With Abby's help,
I found a patent filing

37:46.829 --> 37:48.048
from three years ago

37:48.091 --> 37:49.876
for a grain-based fuel
called Nanathol.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.661
But the patent was
never given because

37:52.705 --> 37:54.054
the fuel left behind
the deadly by-product of...

37:54.097 --> 37:55.273
Formaldehyde.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.274
Who filed it?

38:00.713 --> 38:02.628
Stillwell's company.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.327
Well, Palmer, find out
who spearheaded the project.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.198
Go, now, go.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.939
On it.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.811
Additionally, Jethro,

38:11.854 --> 38:14.683
Lieutenant Thorson
was not poisoned

38:14.727 --> 38:17.033
the same way as
Martin Stillwell.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.209
Hers was more methodical.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.515
Meaning?

38:20.559 --> 38:23.910
Meaning she absorbed the poison
through her skin

38:23.953 --> 38:25.781
over a period of two weeks.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.348
Possibly mixed

38:27.392 --> 38:30.786
in a lotion
or some kind of liquid.

38:30.830 --> 38:33.920
And done by someone
who knew her rituals.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.531
Precisely.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.359
ZIVA:
Every day at 6:00
in the evening

38:38.403 --> 38:40.187
Lieutenant Thorson
took a shower.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.320
It did not change
for two weeks,

38:42.363 --> 38:43.930
but here's what did change.

38:46.933 --> 38:47.977
This is the day

38:48.021 --> 38:50.240
before she died.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.898
She's getting sicker
by the minute.Mm-hmm.

38:55.942 --> 38:56.943
McGEE [over speakers]:
Hey, Tony.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.859
I think McGee
found something.

38:59.902 --> 39:03.384
McGEE:
I'm at some pipes
underneath the stairs

39:03.428 --> 39:05.299
outside Thorson's loft.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.434
Goes right into
the water supply.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.174
She never had a chance, boss.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.614
TONY:
Look who's taking center stage.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.180
Ms. Ferris,
we need to talk to you.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.574
Uh, I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.010
Can't it wait?

39:21.054 --> 39:23.317
Gentlemen.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.885
Excuse us.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.932
I don't understand.

39:29.976 --> 39:32.021
I've told you all I know.
I've helped you.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.545
GIBBS:
No, you only helped
yourself, ma'am.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.112
To a brand-new job
it looks like.

39:36.156 --> 39:39.028
Must feel good to finally
be the one in charge.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.814
TONY:
Doesn't suit you, though.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.163
You're more
of a background player.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.557
I've worked hard
for what I have.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.037
GIBBS:
No, the work only
got you so far.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.431
Lieutenant Thorson--
she was the real deal.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.086
You're a phony.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.218
We were never competitors.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.786
Clea was my friend.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.005
At least that's
what she thought.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.833
This is

40:00.876 --> 40:03.966
a direct quote
from her journal.

40:04.010 --> 40:06.186
"'I feel alone at
Gen-1 most of the time.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.622
"I do not like it here.

40:07.666 --> 40:10.886
"But April makes
the days easier.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.193
"Maybe we will be friends.

40:13.236 --> 40:14.760
I trust her."

40:15.935 --> 40:18.633
She never said...

40:22.158 --> 40:25.031
She didn't care about me.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.249
It's a terrible thing--

40:26.293 --> 40:27.555
betraying someone's trust
like that.

40:30.776 --> 40:36.216
You have no idea
what I had to put up with.

40:38.392 --> 40:41.047
People fawned over her

40:41.090 --> 40:43.092
like she was the Second Coming.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.793
How do you think
that made me feel?

40:47.836 --> 40:49.925
Make you feel bad enough
to kill.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.712
[handcuffs clicking]

41:13.035 --> 41:13.993
It's Tony as Tony.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.734
I am completely
impressed.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.953
Are you supposed
to be Fat Elvis?

41:17.997 --> 41:21.217
[as John Travolta]:
It's Saturday Night Fever.

41:21.261 --> 41:23.481
Travolta, '77.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.395
In a John Badham
directed classic.

41:25.439 --> 41:28.486
[normal voice]:
I know!

41:28.529 --> 41:30.270
Looks ridiculous,

41:30.313 --> 41:31.532
right?

41:31.576 --> 41:33.839
It feels even worse.

41:33.882 --> 41:36.450
It's like I'm
betraying the gods.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.713
I was not aware
you were so religious.

41:38.757 --> 41:40.541
The film gods.McGEE:
So I take it

41:40.585 --> 41:41.847
this means

41:41.890 --> 41:44.937
you haven't ended
things with Ethel?
Ethel.

41:44.980 --> 41:48.506
[as Travolta]:
A man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.246
I'm gonna give
Special Ethel

41:50.290 --> 41:53.554
what she thinks she wants.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.295
But this...

41:57.166 --> 41:59.821
This will always belong to me.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.136
Oh.

42:10.179 --> 42:10.963
[laughing]

42:23.802 --> 42:25.543
Looks good.

42:26.761 --> 42:29.068
I like it.

42:29.111 --> 42:31.636
I'm just trying to
get in the spirit.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.899
It's more "me."

42:36.205 --> 42:38.599
Look, Gibbs, I'm sorry...

42:38.643 --> 42:40.427
I'm sorry that I am...

42:41.733 --> 42:44.257
I'm sorry.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.954
Abbs.

42:45.998 --> 42:47.260
It's okay.
