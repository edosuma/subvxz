00:11.764 --> 00:13.074
Hey, Dean. It's me.

00:14.867 --> 00:16.707
- How long you been back?
- About a year.

00:17.136 --> 00:19.036
You've been back practically
this whole time?

00:19.472 --> 00:21.692
- You finally have what you wanted.
- You wanted a family.

00:22.174 --> 00:23.954
I need you to go. You're a hunter.

00:30.049 --> 00:31.599
It's Sam. He's different.

00:34.186 --> 00:35.936
It's his soul. It's gone.

00:37.156 --> 00:40.726
You bag me a live Alpha and
I'll give you little Sammy's soul back.

00:42.361 --> 00:44.531
- We wait for the word.
- Alpha's building an army.

00:44.997 --> 00:46.897
- Like we're going to war.
- Bring me creatures.

00:50.870 --> 00:52.770
But if you're the first, who made you?

00:53.205 --> 00:54.435
We all have our mothers.

00:54.807 --> 00:57.767
When we freaks die, where do we go?
Not heaven, not hell.

00:58.344 --> 00:59.714
- Purgatory.
- And I want it.

01:00.079 --> 01:02.039
- I want my soul back.
- I can't.

01:05.584 --> 01:09.834
Sam's soul has been locked in the cage
with Michael and Lucifer.

01:10.589 --> 01:12.609
Putting this back in
would smash me to bits.

01:13.059 --> 01:15.989
We have no idea
what will happen. Paralysis, insanity...

01:16.562 --> 01:19.662
psychic pain so profound, he's locked
inside himself for the rest of his life.

01:20.266 --> 01:22.846
- The horseman of Death.
- Hello, Dean.

01:23.369 --> 01:24.479
Death can put up a wall.

01:24.837 --> 01:26.327
- Wall?
- You wouldn't remember hell.

01:26.705 --> 01:27.965
What's the bet?

01:28.340 --> 01:29.890
I want you to be me for one day.

01:30.276 --> 01:31.706
It's my life. It's my soul.

01:32.078 --> 01:34.448
- I don't want it.
- You need to scar your vessel.

01:34.947 --> 01:36.377
I'm sorry.

01:38.117 --> 01:40.517
- Don't do this.
- Don't scratch the wall.

02:01.574 --> 02:02.624
How you doing?

02:04.076 --> 02:06.656
I'm great. This is great.

02:07.179 --> 02:08.579
Penny, it's gonna be okay.

02:09.582 --> 02:11.772
You know, a lot more people
have died in the shower.

02:12.251 --> 02:14.001
Good to know. Thanks.

02:15.321 --> 02:17.461
I didn't think
we'd run into any weather, though.

02:19.125 --> 02:20.905
Look, can we just land, please?

02:21.327 --> 02:24.367
Couple minutes, all right?
We're close. I'm sorry.

02:32.505 --> 02:33.905
- What was that?
- What?

02:34.273 --> 02:36.763
Something just flew by the window.
It was huge.

02:37.276 --> 02:41.466
- It was probably just a bird, okay?
- No. No, Stan, that was not a bird.

02:42.214 --> 02:44.324
- Well, then what was it?
- I don't know.

02:46.652 --> 02:50.052
Penny, there's nothing out there.
I promise.

02:52.224 --> 02:54.624
- Hey, just close your eyes, okay?
- No.

02:55.127 --> 02:58.637
It's okay. Just lean back. Try to relax.

02:59.632 --> 03:02.702
- Think of someplace nice.
- Okay.

03:04.570 --> 03:07.290
Nice waves on a beach.

03:11.377 --> 03:13.107
Stan?

03:13.712 --> 03:15.702
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

03:16.148 --> 03:17.228
No.

03:40.372 --> 03:41.512
Well?

03:41.840 --> 03:43.540
His soul is in place.

03:46.779 --> 03:48.589
Is he ever gonna wake up?

03:49.348 --> 03:51.098
I'm not a human doctor, Dean.

03:51.517 --> 03:54.147
- Could you take a guess?
- Okay.

03:55.254 --> 03:57.424
- Probably not.
- Oh, well, don't sugarcoat it.

03:57.890 --> 04:00.140
I warned you not
to put that thing back inside him.

04:00.626 --> 04:01.996
What was I supposed to do?

04:03.262 --> 04:05.602
Let T-1000 walk around,
hope he doesn't open fire?

04:06.098 --> 04:10.198
Let me tell you what his soul felt like
when I touched it.

04:11.203 --> 04:13.223
Like it had been skinned alive, Dean.

04:15.307 --> 04:18.346
If you wanted to kill your brother,
you should have done it outright.

04:42.468 --> 04:45.098
Like my daddy always said,
"Just because it kills your liver...

04:45.638 --> 04:47.098
don't mean it ain't medicine."

04:47.673 --> 04:49.543
Sam still asleep?

04:50.309 --> 04:51.599
Yeah.

04:52.344 --> 04:55.034
- He'll wake up.
- Yeah.

04:55.581 --> 04:58.241
Dean, he's been through how much?

04:58.784 --> 05:00.244
Somehow he always bounces back.

05:01.153 --> 05:03.463
He's never been through this.

05:07.326 --> 05:09.056
- Job?
- Hmm, might be.

05:12.097 --> 05:14.967
Can I help?
Send me to the library? Anything?

05:15.567 --> 05:18.557
Couple goes up in a light plane.
Wreckage was just found in the woods.

05:19.138 --> 05:22.238
Couple of Buddy Hollys doesn't really
seem like "News of the Weird."

05:22.841 --> 05:26.531
Pilot was found 17 miles away,
flambÃ©ed.

05:27.212 --> 05:30.522
Girl's just gone. No body, no nothing.

05:31.517 --> 05:33.357
- Okay, I'm not changing the channel.
- Dean.

05:40.893 --> 05:42.063
Sam?

05:43.796 --> 05:45.166
Are you...?

06:04.316 --> 06:05.336
Good to see you.

06:05.651 --> 06:07.871
Wait. I saw...

06:08.354 --> 06:10.604
I felt Lucifer snap your neck.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.645
- Well, Cass kind of...
- Cass is alive?

06:16.161 --> 06:18.681
Yeah, Cass is fine.
Sam, are you okay?

06:21.633 --> 06:22.833
Actually, um...

06:23.168 --> 06:24.338
I'm starving.

06:31.043 --> 06:33.263
- So, Sam.
- Yeah?

06:33.746 --> 06:35.886
What's the last thing you remember?

06:38.917 --> 06:41.347
The field, and then I fell.

06:42.354 --> 06:44.194
Okay, and then?

06:45.357 --> 06:48.197
Um, I woke up in the panic room.

06:48.761 --> 06:50.311
That's it?

06:50.696 --> 06:52.626
- You really don't remember...
- Let's be glad.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.327
Who wants to remember all that hell?

06:57.903 --> 07:00.093
- Well, how long was I gone?
- About a year and a half.

07:00.572 --> 07:01.472
What?

07:03.876 --> 07:05.516
I was downstairs...

07:06.745 --> 07:07.825
I don't remember anything.

07:09.548 --> 07:11.298
So how'd I get back? Was it Cass?

07:12.818 --> 07:13.808
Not exactly.

07:15.487 --> 07:17.297
Dean, what did you do?

07:19.425 --> 07:21.005
- Me and Death...
- Death?

07:21.393 --> 07:24.083
- The horseman?
- I had leverage.

07:25.197 --> 07:26.337
It's done.

07:27.499 --> 07:29.639
- You sure?
- It's over.

07:30.102 --> 07:31.062
Slate's wiped.

07:32.504 --> 07:35.754
- Well, isn't this just neat and clean?
- Yes, it is, for once.

07:40.612 --> 07:42.222
Is there anything else I should know?

07:45.784 --> 07:47.074
No.

07:47.419 --> 07:50.049
- Another beer?
- Uh, yeah.

07:54.526 --> 07:55.486
Hey.

07:57.429 --> 07:59.039
How is he?

07:59.865 --> 08:01.295
He's, uh...

08:02.000 --> 08:04.720
He's good. Really good.
Better than I could have hoped.

08:07.339 --> 08:08.449
Mm-hm.

08:08.774 --> 08:10.234
What? Why the poopface?

08:20.986 --> 08:23.356
I'm glad he's better. I really am.

08:24.356 --> 08:29.216
But that kid went straight-up
Menendez on me not 10 days ago.

08:30.496 --> 08:32.546
And now it's all just erased?

08:34.299 --> 08:36.818
Sorry. I'm having a bit of a hard time
even looking at him.

08:37.336 --> 08:39.676
- It wasn't Sam.
- Well, maybe it wasn't all Sam...

08:40.172 --> 08:41.922
- but it was him.
- What do you wanna do?

08:42.341 --> 08:46.261
- You want to tell him everything?
- No. Just wish I could, that's all.

08:46.979 --> 08:50.079
We throw that at him, we don't know
what'll happen. Could crack the wall.

08:50.682 --> 08:51.882
I know. I know.

08:52.217 --> 08:54.207
So you know what?
As far as I'm concerned...

08:54.653 --> 08:56.793
it's a gift horse
and I'm not looking for teeth.

08:57.289 --> 08:59.369
I'm sending Death
a damn fruit basket.

09:01.393 --> 09:02.733
He's gonna find out, you know.

09:04.096 --> 09:07.526
One way or another, someone will
tell him or he'll figure it out on his own.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.976
He's not dumb.
He should hear it from us.

09:13.205 --> 09:15.395
Can we just leave it alone
for the moment, please?

09:16.575 --> 09:18.125
Okay.

09:19.011 --> 09:21.091
But you better prep for the B side...

09:21.547 --> 09:24.007
because when Sam realizes
we're shining him...

09:25.751 --> 09:28.271
it ain't gonna be cute.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.730
Sam still asleep?

09:40.065 --> 09:41.875
Yeah, let him rest. We'll call him later.

09:42.334 --> 09:43.674
Call me from where?

09:44.937 --> 09:45.987
Oh.

09:46.838 --> 09:49.058
- Uh, there's this thing in Oregon.
- Great. I'm in.

09:49.541 --> 09:51.351
Whoa, whoa, you just got vertical.

09:51.777 --> 09:53.327
Exactly. I'm up. I'm good.

09:53.712 --> 09:55.322
A few more days of cable couldn't hurt.

09:55.714 --> 09:58.584
Right, because that's what you did
when you got back from hell.

10:01.219 --> 10:02.999
All right. You, me and Bobby.

10:03.422 --> 10:05.472
Oh, you two go on ahead.
You got this covered.

10:06.391 --> 10:11.111
I, uh, forgot I promised that idiot Rufus
I'd work the phones for him, so...

10:11.930 --> 10:13.220
You sure?

10:14.466 --> 10:16.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You two enjoy catching up, okay?

10:22.307 --> 10:23.947
What was that?

10:24.943 --> 10:27.403
One part age, three parts liquor.

10:37.122 --> 10:39.782
You got it, officer. Thank you.
You too.

10:40.325 --> 10:44.075
Besides the crash, there were two other
disappearances in town this week.

10:44.763 --> 10:45.783
- Really?
- Last weekend...

10:46.098 --> 10:48.178
a college girl vanished
from her apartment.

10:48.634 --> 10:49.974
On the 17th floor.

10:50.335 --> 10:52.325
Another girl didn't make it home
from school.

10:52.771 --> 10:54.521
- They know each other?
- No. No connection.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.280
Just young and female,
like the plane crash girl.

10:57.776 --> 10:59.556
What would disappear a girl
out of the sky?

10:59.978 --> 11:01.618
Good question.

11:02.014 --> 11:03.414
<i>Yeah</i>

11:03.782 --> 11:05.772
<i>And then I kissed you once</i>

11:06.718 --> 11:08.858
So you never even tried, huh?

11:09.321 --> 11:11.401
- Tried?
- To go live a life, after.

11:12.791 --> 11:14.721
You do remember
you promised that, right?

11:16.995 --> 11:18.805
Yeah, I remember.

11:19.464 --> 11:21.894
- So why didn't you try?
- What makes you think I didn't?

11:22.434 --> 11:25.274
Because look at you. Look at this.
You're exactly the same.

11:27.973 --> 11:29.343
Yeah, you're probably right.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.608
<i>Looking for a game to play</i>

11:33.078 --> 11:34.098
<i>My luck should be so bad...</i>

11:34.446 --> 11:37.196
I was with them for a year,
Lisa and Ben.

11:39.017 --> 11:40.217
A year?

11:41.453 --> 11:42.383
So then what?

11:42.688 --> 11:44.438
<i>Oh, I had to leave today</i>

11:44.856 --> 11:46.166
Didn't work out.

11:47.726 --> 11:50.826
<i>It was a new day yesterday</i>

11:51.463 --> 11:54.273
<i>But it's an old day now</i>

12:01.173 --> 12:03.543
You're, uh, Penny Dessertine's sister,
right?

12:04.042 --> 12:04.942
Mm-hm.

12:05.243 --> 12:07.323
Uh, we'd just like to ask you
a few questions.

12:07.779 --> 12:09.889
Look, the cops already came by.
I'm tired.

12:10.348 --> 12:13.008
- So if you don't mind...
- I understand. Really, I do.

12:13.752 --> 12:15.012
I know how hard this must be.

12:15.353 --> 12:17.433
We'd just like
to figure out what happened.

12:17.889 --> 12:20.079
This will be quick. I promise.

12:21.293 --> 12:22.903
Okay. Fine. Come in.

12:30.769 --> 12:33.929
Penny was very shy. To herself.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.350
Not at all
what you'd call adventurous.

12:37.242 --> 12:39.322
Flying through a lightning storm
in a two-seater?

12:39.778 --> 12:41.238
She was terrified of that thing.

12:43.115 --> 12:45.575
- She just did it for Stan.
- Stan?

12:47.319 --> 12:50.339
They were just starting to get serious.

12:50.922 --> 12:54.732
She didn't wanna seem,
you know, not interested.

12:57.028 --> 12:59.338
I just wish I'd told her to stay home.

12:59.831 --> 13:01.561
We don't even have a body to bury.

13:08.673 --> 13:10.863
- Hey.
- What do you got?

13:12.577 --> 13:17.297
Well, looks like those other two missing
girls both baked cookies for the Lord.

13:18.116 --> 13:19.486
- What is that, code?
- No.

13:19.851 --> 13:22.541
Church choir, bake sales,
uh, promise ring clubs, the works.

13:23.088 --> 13:24.428
They were good girls.

13:24.790 --> 13:28.010
- But Penny wasn't even a Christian, so...
- I have another theory.

13:28.860 --> 13:29.820
Penny's diary.

13:30.295 --> 13:32.045
Did you steal that from her room?

13:32.631 --> 13:35.591
- I love that you even ask me that.
- And why wouldn't I?

13:36.168 --> 13:37.598
No reason. So girlnappings.

13:37.969 --> 13:40.779
What if it's not about religion?
What if it's about purity?

13:42.874 --> 13:45.424
- You mean you think they're all...?
- Virgins, Sam. Virgins.

13:47.479 --> 13:49.559
- Penny was 22.
- Yeah, with a pink room.

13:50.015 --> 13:51.915
- So?
- And stuffed teddy bears.

13:53.718 --> 13:55.268
Fine, but you really think...?

13:56.855 --> 14:01.335
"I've decided I'm going to give Stan
my most precious gift."

14:04.963 --> 14:06.953
Wow. That sounded creepy
coming out of your mouth.

14:07.732 --> 14:08.722
I think I delivered it.

14:09.034 --> 14:11.934
You know, you could have led
with the diary, you know?

14:12.504 --> 14:15.434
Anyways, let's say you're right. Fine.
Who would want virgins?

14:16.374 --> 14:19.714
You got me.
I prefer ladies with experience.

14:20.345 --> 14:22.335
- I just can't believe it.
- Yeah, I know, right?

14:26.017 --> 14:27.067
I'm going this way.

14:27.385 --> 14:28.525
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

14:29.054 --> 14:31.484
- Bye.
- See you guys tomorrow.

15:05.891 --> 15:07.941
No. No.

15:22.107 --> 15:23.747
It happened so fast.

15:24.142 --> 15:25.602
It's all right, Melissa.

15:25.977 --> 15:28.057
What came at you? You can tell us.

15:30.148 --> 15:32.338
It... It looked like, uh...

15:34.853 --> 15:36.023
a giant bat.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.388
You think I'm making it up, right?

15:42.828 --> 15:46.638
- That's what the other man said.
- Well, I'm not the other man.

15:51.002 --> 15:53.172
It came right at me.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.692
It was huge. I swear.

15:57.242 --> 15:59.142
That's how I got this.

16:07.018 --> 16:10.268
So it attacked,
and then what happened?

16:11.022 --> 16:12.222
I don't know.

16:12.557 --> 16:15.337
I passed out and when I woke up,
it was gone.

16:17.662 --> 16:18.972
Anything else you can think of?

16:19.331 --> 16:22.461
Anything you can tell us,
even if it doesn't seem important?

16:23.335 --> 16:25.855
Well, my ring got lost.

16:27.205 --> 16:29.695
Or else that thing stole it,
if that makes any sense.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.108
- What kind of ring?
- Gold.

16:32.544 --> 16:33.884
Promise ring.

16:35.046 --> 16:36.386
Promise ring.

16:36.748 --> 16:40.698
So, uh, from, like, a church,
like a purity ring?

16:41.419 --> 16:43.289
Yeah. Why?

16:44.689 --> 16:46.909
Ahem. I gotta ask. Ahh...

16:47.392 --> 16:52.582
Melissa, look, nobody is judging
anybody here, okay? Believe me.

16:54.366 --> 16:56.326
But should you really be wearing
that ring?

16:58.303 --> 17:00.583
- Well, I mean, I am...
- Really?

17:08.180 --> 17:10.050
Matt Barne didn't count.

17:13.417 --> 17:16.318
So, what, you think Batman
tried to rape her?

17:16.887 --> 17:18.498
Well, he does carry a lot of rage.

17:18.890 --> 17:21.579
But he rejected her because
she was already dehymenated, huh?

17:22.127 --> 17:23.027
You think?

17:23.328 --> 17:26.318
I think it just goes to show that
being easy is pretty much all upside.

17:28.098 --> 17:30.409
So, what kind of thing
likes virgins and gold?

17:30.902 --> 17:32.652
- P. Diddy?
- Heh.

17:33.071 --> 17:34.471
- It's comforting.
- What's that?

17:34.839 --> 17:37.329
I died for a year, came back
and you're still not funny.

17:37.842 --> 17:40.182
Shut up. I'm hilarious.

17:46.484 --> 17:48.324
- This can't be possible.
- Try me.

17:48.753 --> 17:51.383
I Googled fire, claws, flying...

17:51.923 --> 17:54.793
stealing virgins and gold,
and it all takes me to the same place.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.110
- Where?
- "World of Warcraft" fansites.

18:01.099 --> 18:03.729
- I don't know what that means.
- Dragons, dude.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.063
See? Told you. Not possible.

18:07.505 --> 18:10.025
- Actually, it might be.
- How? In what reality?

18:10.542 --> 18:13.582
It's been a strange year.
We should get a second opinion.

18:20.819 --> 18:21.719
Yeah?

18:22.020 --> 18:23.420
<i>What do you know about dragons?</i>

18:23.788 --> 18:25.278
What? Nothing.

18:25.657 --> 18:26.677
Seriously.

18:26.992 --> 18:29.162
Well, they're not like
the Loch Ness monster, Dean.

18:29.628 --> 18:31.378
Dragons aren't real.

18:31.796 --> 18:34.196
<i>- Could you make a few calls?</i>
- To who, Hogwarts?

18:35.066 --> 18:37.236
- Humor me.
- Fine.

18:37.702 --> 18:39.692
- You're a gentleman and a scholar.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

18:40.138 --> 18:42.188
Hey, how's <i>Memento</i>
doing over there?

18:42.641 --> 18:44.891
<i>He caught you in any lies yet?</i>

18:45.710 --> 18:48.340
Everything's fine. Sam says hey.

18:56.321 --> 18:57.841
You okay?

18:58.223 --> 18:59.213
Yeah.

19:00.725 --> 19:01.985
Bobby say anything?

19:02.661 --> 19:03.971
Nope.

19:19.244 --> 19:21.764
Dad never wrote anything
about dragons. I promise.

19:22.314 --> 19:25.214
I'd remember if I read
<i>The Neverending Story </i> in there.

19:26.718 --> 19:28.888
Hey, did we hunt a Skinwalker lately?

19:32.524 --> 19:33.754
Doesn't ring a bell. Why?

19:35.527 --> 19:38.157
I don't know.
Just dÃ©jÃ  vu or something.

19:39.931 --> 19:43.151
- Are you sure? I could have sworn...
- Your eggs are still a little scrambled.

19:43.768 --> 19:44.908
But, yeah, I'm sure.

19:48.406 --> 19:50.486
All right. Yeah. Never mind.

19:55.647 --> 19:56.817
Hey, Bobby. What do you got?

19:57.148 --> 19:59.168
<i>Can't believe she didn't
jump right to mind.</i>

20:00.385 --> 20:03.225
Dr. Visyak. Medieval Studies, SFU.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.828
Dr. Visyak, SFU. Got it. Thanks.

20:12.263 --> 20:16.363
All right. I'm going to San Francisco,
figure out how to kill these things.

20:17.402 --> 20:20.772
- You figure out where they are.
- Did Bobby say where they like to park?

20:21.406 --> 20:23.486
- No.
- Great. Back to the lore.

20:23.942 --> 20:26.162
Which says what,
that they live in Middle-earth?

20:27.011 --> 20:28.531
No, caves.

20:30.582 --> 20:32.422
You're such a nerd.

20:53.638 --> 20:56.188
Please. Oh, please.

21:03.782 --> 21:06.912
- Please, please, let me go.
- Shut up. Shut up.

21:09.721 --> 21:10.681
Please.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.590
No. No.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.913
Shut up.
Shut up or I'll break the other one.

21:24.569 --> 21:27.089
Now get in there. Come on.

21:44.456 --> 21:47.116
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

22:08.046 --> 22:10.656
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Dr. Visyak.

22:11.182 --> 22:12.852
My name is Dean Winchester.

22:13.251 --> 22:14.921
<i>Office hours are Monday and Friday.</i>

22:15.320 --> 22:17.400
Bobby Singer sent me.

22:20.058 --> 22:21.518
Hello?

22:31.836 --> 22:33.006
Hi.

22:34.272 --> 22:35.562
Bobby Singer.

22:36.207 --> 22:39.137
Tell him something for me
next time you see him.

22:39.844 --> 22:43.244
Actually, just kick him in the jewels.
That's more poetic.

22:45.049 --> 22:46.799
No love lost between you two, huh?

22:48.720 --> 22:50.650
No. Just the opposite.

22:51.589 --> 22:52.639
Oh?

22:53.258 --> 22:54.658
That's his story to tell.

22:55.026 --> 22:56.726
He's the idiot.

22:59.931 --> 23:01.361
So, what's this about?

23:03.535 --> 23:05.675
Well, ahem, ahh...

23:06.170 --> 23:07.100
dragons.

23:08.039 --> 23:09.029
Really?

23:11.976 --> 23:13.966
What, no 12-sided-dice joke?

23:14.412 --> 23:16.632
We can joke about them
because they've disappeared.

23:17.115 --> 23:19.745
But they aren't funny. At all.

23:20.285 --> 23:22.475
Well, one just flew in stateside.

23:22.954 --> 23:25.034
- Are you sure?
- Fits the lore to a T.

23:28.993 --> 23:31.543
But how? I mean, why?
It's been 700 years.

23:32.430 --> 23:34.680
Banner crop of crazy
all the way around these days, doc.

23:35.199 --> 23:37.719
- So you wanna know how to kill it.
- That's right.

23:40.071 --> 23:42.181
Well, you need a blade.

23:45.076 --> 23:47.216
Ahh, ahem. Okay. What kind of blade?

23:48.112 --> 23:49.892
One forged with dragons' blood.

23:53.651 --> 23:56.961
You need one to kill one, but gotta kill
one to make one. How does that work?

23:57.589 --> 23:59.549
There aren't many dragon swords
around anymore.

23:59.991 --> 24:01.481
Five or six tops, worldwide.

24:01.859 --> 24:04.439
There's the sword of St. George
and of course Excalibur and...

24:04.963 --> 24:08.153
- You know a lot about this, don't you?
- Well, I sure as hell better.

24:08.766 --> 24:10.136
I have one in the basement.

24:11.469 --> 24:12.399
You have one.

24:12.770 --> 24:15.050
Finding it took two decades,
countless hours...

24:15.540 --> 24:19.850
and some really bad sex with an
Eastern European ambassador, but, yeah.

24:27.018 --> 24:30.088
That is not real. Is that real?

24:31.189 --> 24:34.089
- Is it Excalibur?
- Ha. No.

24:34.692 --> 24:38.152
This is the sword of Bruncvik.

24:38.796 --> 24:40.256
Love of my life.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.140
So, uh, what's with the cement shoe?

24:45.637 --> 24:48.507
You know, binding sword to stone
used to be all the rage.

24:49.207 --> 24:51.347
To protect them.

24:52.577 --> 24:54.447
All right, well,
how do we get this puppy out?

24:56.547 --> 24:58.387
Oh, come on. You know this one.

24:58.816 --> 25:02.066
We need a brave knight who's willing
to step up and kill the beast.

25:03.221 --> 25:04.331
Right.

25:06.090 --> 25:09.430
All right, well, I'll, uh, give it a whirl.
Do you mind?

25:10.061 --> 25:11.351
Oh.

25:33.217 --> 25:34.417
You okay?

25:35.053 --> 25:36.663
Never better.

25:55.039 --> 25:56.849
Oh, son of a bitch.
That's really on there.

25:57.742 --> 26:00.112
Yeah, afraid so.

26:01.546 --> 26:03.796
- Well, I have another idea.
- What?

26:05.083 --> 26:06.953
You're not gonna like it.

26:31.476 --> 26:34.496
- Sam. Where's Dean?
<i>- Hey. Um...</i>

26:35.079 --> 26:36.569
He went to go see your friend.

26:36.948 --> 26:40.288
So look, I'm trying to figure out
where this thing lairs up.

26:40.918 --> 26:43.258
- Little help, maybe?
- What are the parameters?

26:43.755 --> 26:46.335
Caves, basically.
But there's nothing around for miles.

26:46.891 --> 26:49.031
So less literal, then.

26:49.494 --> 26:51.574
What else you got local
that's cold, dark and wet?

26:52.029 --> 26:53.459
Huh.

26:53.831 --> 26:55.561
Well, um...

26:55.967 --> 26:57.337
there's no subway lines.

26:59.137 --> 27:01.157
Sewers. Heh.

27:01.606 --> 27:03.156
- That could be it. Thanks.
- All right.

27:03.541 --> 27:05.531
Wait, Bobby. Wait. Um...

27:06.978 --> 27:10.018
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course. Why? What's wrong?

27:10.615 --> 27:12.865
Besides the way you been acting
and talking, nothing.

27:14.786 --> 27:16.776
- Is there something I should know?
- No.

27:17.221 --> 27:19.411
<i>All you need to know
is where Godzilla's holed up.</i>

27:19.924 --> 27:22.064
Well, Bobby,
what happened this last year?

27:25.830 --> 27:27.230
It had its moments.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.735
<i>No more than usual.</i>

27:30.134 --> 27:32.244
Got nothing to do with you, Sam.
How could it?

27:32.703 --> 27:35.313
- Right. Of course.
- Call me if you need anything.

27:58.496 --> 28:00.136
Castiel.

28:00.598 --> 28:01.968
Um...

28:03.267 --> 28:06.547
I'm back, so if you got a minute...

28:15.913 --> 28:17.463
Sam.

28:18.216 --> 28:19.766
It's so good to see you alive.

28:21.052 --> 28:23.982
Yeah. You too.

28:28.526 --> 28:32.536
- Um, look, I would hug you, but...
- That would be awkward.

28:34.098 --> 28:37.258
Um, so crazy year, huh? Heh.

28:37.902 --> 28:40.592
I just talked to Bobby.
He told me everything that happened.

28:41.138 --> 28:43.598
Frankly, I'm surprised
that you survived.

28:45.276 --> 28:46.796
I was begging Dean not to do it.

28:47.812 --> 28:50.212
Yeah. No, I can understand that.

28:50.715 --> 28:52.525
You know, it's a miracle
it didn't kill you.

28:53.017 --> 28:55.977
Yeah. Yeah, it's a miracle, all right.

28:57.221 --> 28:58.891
So how does it feel?

28:59.657 --> 29:02.267
- What?
- Well, to have your soul back, of course.

29:05.463 --> 29:08.863
Right. You mean because I was walking
around with no soul.

29:10.067 --> 29:11.707
Uh...

29:12.103 --> 29:14.293
Really good, Cass. I'm real good.

29:14.772 --> 29:17.992
You know what? I'm just hazy
on a few of the details, though.

29:19.911 --> 29:22.901
You think maybe
you could walk me through?

29:27.551 --> 29:30.651
You know what?
I don't like this at all.

29:31.822 --> 29:36.182
You do realize that this is the single most
valuable artifact you have ever touched?

29:36.961 --> 29:38.571
It's also the only weapon we got.

29:40.598 --> 29:43.728
Look, I know what I'm doing, okay?
I actually learned it all from Bobby.

29:44.335 --> 29:47.875
Hey, whatever happened there,
you know he's at least a genius at this.

29:48.839 --> 29:50.979
You want me to kill that dragon
or not?

29:54.645 --> 29:55.935
Okay.

29:57.114 --> 29:58.484
Trust me.

30:05.456 --> 30:07.856
You rocks think you're so smart.

30:20.638 --> 30:24.558
All right.
Welcome to the 21st century.

30:33.851 --> 30:36.041
All right, stand back.

30:57.508 --> 30:59.618
Okay. Now...

31:15.393 --> 31:16.973
You've got insurance for this, right?

31:28.246 --> 31:30.826
What are we supposed to do with this,
give it a booster shot?

31:31.349 --> 31:33.869
It's what we got.
We just have to get closer. That's all.

31:34.585 --> 31:36.135
- Where are we on the caves?
- Nowhere.

31:36.521 --> 31:39.481
Sewers, on the other hand.
Here, check this out.

31:40.058 --> 31:42.958
So two of the disappearances
happened within a mile of here.

31:43.528 --> 31:45.778
So I figure we start there,
work our way around.

31:46.264 --> 31:49.194
Awesome. Who doesn't love sewers?
Let's go.

31:53.571 --> 31:54.531
What?

31:57.775 --> 31:59.175
Nothing. Uh, yeah, let's go.

32:05.950 --> 32:10.310
Oh, God. Just when I get used
to a smell, I hit a new flavor.

32:11.089 --> 32:12.669
Dude, we have been here for hours.

32:13.057 --> 32:17.187
There is nothing. I think the lore is off.
Hey, what if dragons like nice hotels?

32:17.929 --> 32:19.739
- What is that?
- What?

32:20.832 --> 32:22.672
Holy crap.

32:26.838 --> 32:29.028
Okay, maybe there are dragons here.

32:30.975 --> 32:34.015
Wait. Dean, not now. Check this out.

32:49.627 --> 32:51.707
A little arts-and-crafty
for a giant bat, right?

32:54.999 --> 32:55.899
Huh.

32:56.234 --> 32:59.044
Hello? Is someone there?

32:59.604 --> 33:02.184
Can you please help us?

33:17.889 --> 33:19.119
Hello?

33:19.657 --> 33:21.407
Over here.

33:21.826 --> 33:23.436
Help us.

33:23.828 --> 33:25.318
Hey. We're gonna get you out.

33:26.531 --> 33:28.871
- He's coming back.
- Okay.

33:36.574 --> 33:38.384
Where do you think
you're gonna stick that?

33:42.980 --> 33:44.790
- Where did you get that?
- Comic-Con.

34:05.703 --> 34:06.723
Come on, come on.

35:05.514 --> 35:08.004
Hey, Sam. Ahem.
Ask me what time it is.

35:10.753 --> 35:12.773
Why don't you cut to the chase,
just roll in it?

35:13.222 --> 35:15.212
I rarely have wealth.

35:23.099 --> 35:25.379
- Dean.
- Yeah?

35:28.404 --> 35:30.424
I am so...

35:31.507 --> 35:34.937
so sorry. I can't even begin to say.

35:36.946 --> 35:38.206
For what?

35:40.082 --> 35:41.392
You know what.

35:47.390 --> 35:49.200
- Did Bobby...?
- Cass.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.345
Cass. Frigging child.

35:52.895 --> 35:55.235
- You should have told me.
- You weren't supposed to know.

35:55.731 --> 36:00.181
What I did? To Bobby? To you?
Of course I should know.

36:00.970 --> 36:03.110
Sam, Death didn't just shove
your soul back in.

36:03.572 --> 36:06.882
He put up the Great Wall of Sam between
you and the things you don't remember.

36:07.543 --> 36:10.123
Trust me when I say
the things you don't know could kill you.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.926
- That's not a joke.
- All right.

36:13.983 --> 36:15.293
But I have to set things right.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.401
- Or what I can anyway.
- It wasn't you.

36:19.355 --> 36:21.785
I feel like I got slipped
the worst mickey of all time.

36:22.291 --> 36:25.281
And I woke up to find out
that I had burnt the whole city down.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.060
And you can say it wasn't me...

36:30.366 --> 36:32.356
but I'm the one with the zippo
in my pocket.

36:32.802 --> 36:34.792
So I'm not sure it's that cut-and-dry.

36:36.839 --> 36:39.449
Look, I appreciate you trying
to protect me. I really do.

36:39.975 --> 36:41.935
But I gotta fix...

36:43.979 --> 36:44.939
what I gotta fix.

36:45.648 --> 36:47.728
So I need to know what I did.

36:48.718 --> 36:50.998
- That could be dangerous.
- What would you do?

36:54.090 --> 36:55.430
Right. Same thing.

36:56.325 --> 36:57.755
Sam...

36:59.895 --> 37:02.295
Boys, something I think
you ought to see.

37:05.868 --> 37:10.058
Now, as near as I can figure it,
this dates back around the 14th century.

37:11.474 --> 37:13.664
- What language is it?
<i>- Da Vinci Code.</i>

37:14.376 --> 37:15.836
Real obscure Latinate.

37:16.212 --> 37:19.172
Gonna take me my golden years
to translate it all.

37:19.749 --> 37:21.709
Oh, and, uh, FYI...

37:23.018 --> 37:24.768
- that ain't paper.
- What is it?

37:25.654 --> 37:27.174
It's human skin.

37:31.393 --> 37:34.023
Okay. I'm fairly clear on this first bit.

37:34.563 --> 37:38.903
It basically describes this place. It's
like the backside of your worst nightmares.

37:39.668 --> 37:42.188
It's all blood and bone and darkness.

37:43.272 --> 37:48.602
<i>Filled with the bodies and souls
of all things hungry, sharp and nasty.</i>

37:54.016 --> 37:55.216
Where are they?

37:57.353 --> 38:00.193
- I ran into trouble.
- You're damn lucky I got enough.

38:10.733 --> 38:12.633
This is your lucky day, little girl.

38:14.236 --> 38:15.406
Come on.

38:19.775 --> 38:20.795
Come on.

38:21.177 --> 38:23.197
<i>- Monsters?
- It's monster land.</i>

38:23.679 --> 38:27.019
According to this, it goes by many names,
most of which I can't pronounce...

38:27.683 --> 38:29.763
but I'm thinking
you know purgatory.

38:31.086 --> 38:32.396
Purgatory?

38:34.223 --> 38:37.763
Awesome.
Well, that is, ahem, good to know.

38:38.427 --> 38:42.847
So you're saying that these dragon
freaks were squatting in the sewers...

38:43.632 --> 38:46.852
and reading tone poems
about purgatory?

38:47.469 --> 38:49.079
Oh, no, no, no.

38:49.471 --> 38:52.191
- They're reading an instruction manual.
- What?

38:52.741 --> 38:57.161
<i>Yeah. If you're nuts enough
to want access to a place that gnarly...</i>

38:57.947 --> 39:00.377
<i>this book will show you
how to open a door.</i>

39:04.220 --> 39:05.770
Door to purgatory.

39:06.155 --> 39:08.735
I know a demon who would have loved
to have known about that.

39:11.493 --> 39:13.893
So how do you open the door?

39:16.265 --> 39:19.335
Ask <i>Cloverfield.</i>
I'm pretty sure he's got that page.

39:47.029 --> 39:48.139
No.

39:53.302 --> 39:54.232
Let me go! Please, no!

39:54.970 --> 39:56.460
Don't!

39:57.706 --> 39:59.286
It'll go easier if you relax.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.480
<i>- It gets worse.
- Worse?</i>

40:16.859 --> 40:19.879
This ain't talking about
how to take a vacation over there.

40:21.163 --> 40:24.353
This is all about opening a door
to let something in.

40:25.567 --> 40:26.997
Bring something here.

40:27.369 --> 40:29.299
- What?
- I'm working on it.

40:32.174 --> 40:33.514
Could you give us something?

40:33.876 --> 40:35.576
- I got a name.
- Okay.

40:37.579 --> 40:39.419
- Mother.
- Mother?

40:39.848 --> 40:42.478
- Mother of what? Mother of dragons?
- I wish.

40:43.252 --> 40:45.092
It says it a few times here.

40:45.854 --> 40:46.964
Mother of all.

41:03.772 --> 41:04.732
Welcome.

41:08.077 --> 41:09.857
You kept me waiting.

41:10.279 --> 41:11.979
<i>What the hell
does "mother of all" mean?</i>

41:13.415 --> 41:14.435
I don't know.

41:20.589 --> 41:22.259
We have so much to do.
