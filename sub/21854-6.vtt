WEBVTT

00:00.561 --> 00:03.998
Ugh! God, it's so ridiculous
that we can't, like,

00:04.030 --> 00:05.332
control the heat in our own apartment.

00:05.366 --> 00:07.067
It's like, we're old enough to drink,

00:07.101 --> 00:09.670
we're old enough to chaperone
a high school dance, to vote.

00:09.703 --> 00:10.871
Like that did fuck anything.

00:10.904 --> 00:12.840
But to control your own temperature, no.

00:12.873 --> 00:15.676
Some crazy landlord in
the sky gets to do that.

00:15.709 --> 00:17.778
And I was this close
to being able to afford

00:17.811 --> 00:20.614
the Hot Dream Q20-X space heater.

00:20.648 --> 00:22.182
It's the one that Drew Barrymore uses.

00:22.216 --> 00:24.118
Do you, like, get her credit
card statements or something?

00:24.151 --> 00:26.620
I think she's got great taste,
and, like, a pixie spirit.

00:26.654 --> 00:28.455
Dude, just let me buy it for you.

00:28.489 --> 00:29.556
I'm a waitress.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.525
I am for real rich, not Trump rich.

00:31.558 --> 00:33.360
No, I don't want you to buy it for me.

00:33.394 --> 00:35.929
I should be able to buy
this stuff for myself.

00:35.963 --> 00:37.965
I mean, it's just hard
right now without a job.

00:37.998 --> 00:39.533
I'm a little hard right now.

00:42.136 --> 00:43.437
Okay.

00:45.839 --> 00:48.075
Oh, my God, when were you gonna tell me?

00:48.108 --> 00:49.076
About what?

00:49.109 --> 00:51.211
About this, Abigail.

00:51.245 --> 00:53.714
The most powerful
moment in a woman's life:

00:53.747 --> 00:54.882
Your first gray hair!

00:54.915 --> 00:56.884
No, is it... Oh, my gosh! No, no, no!

00:56.917 --> 00:58.786
- Yas, rejoice, yas, yas!
- No!

00:58.819 --> 01:00.688
I'm not rejoicing, I'm freaking out!

01:00.721 --> 01:01.989
What happened? You guys okay?

01:02.022 --> 01:03.691
Dude, aren't you freezing?

01:03.724 --> 01:05.525
No, I was snuggled under a blanket.

01:05.559 --> 01:06.727
What's going on?

01:06.760 --> 01:08.195
Dude, Abi got her first gray hair.

01:08.228 --> 01:10.197
I'm full-on flooding with envy.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.765
Well, you can have it if you want it.

01:11.799 --> 01:13.634
God, I wish it were that simple.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.869
Don't you see? You're becoming a witch.

01:15.903 --> 01:18.672
A dope and powerful fucking witch.

01:18.706 --> 01:19.974
Like Dame Judi Dench.

01:20.007 --> 01:23.110
And Stacey London from "What
Not to Wear" before you.

01:23.143 --> 01:24.211
You're ascending.

01:24.244 --> 01:25.679
Witches aren't real, you guys.

01:28.148 --> 01:30.384
Uh, okay.

01:30.417 --> 01:33.220
Wow. What do you think this is all...
What do you think is happening here?

01:33.253 --> 01:37.424
You think this is all
just literal stuff?

01:37.458 --> 01:40.661
Dude, if witches aren't real,
then who makes all the kombucha?

01:40.694 --> 01:43.364
And where do scarves
come from? Scarf tree?

01:43.397 --> 01:45.532
There's people that
knit all over the place.

01:45.566 --> 01:47.034
You are magical.

01:47.067 --> 01:50.938
It's a swirling chasm of magic.

01:50.971 --> 01:54.241
Okay, I just thought that by
the time I'd have gray hair,

01:54.275 --> 01:55.876
I'd have... I don't know,

01:55.909 --> 01:58.445
a MacArthur Genius Grant or
at least be posting pictures

01:58.479 --> 02:01.148
of "akai" bowls on my Instagram account.

02:01.181 --> 02:02.249
Acai.

02:02.283 --> 02:03.284
Whatever.

02:03.317 --> 02:06.487
Well, where am I now? Nowhere.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.021
I mean, what do I have? Nothing.

02:08.055 --> 02:09.857
You have a gray hair on your head.

02:09.889 --> 02:11.625
He's right. That's something.

02:11.659 --> 02:13.260
First of all, I don't like
what's going on with you two.

02:13.294 --> 02:14.662
But you know what?

02:14.695 --> 02:17.231
I'm gonna take my life
into my own hands right now.

02:17.264 --> 02:20.467
I am gonna buy that Drew
Barrymore space heater

02:20.501 --> 02:23.137
with my money that I
make selling my artwork.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.705
Double, double, toil and trouble,

02:24.738 --> 02:26.707
fire burn and cauldron bubble, bitch!

02:26.740 --> 02:27.975
Oh, my God, I totally forgot!

02:28.008 --> 02:30.210
I have 250 handmade Christmas cards

02:30.244 --> 02:32.313
that I was planning on
sending my 250 camp friends.

02:32.346 --> 02:33.714
250 camp friends?

02:33.747 --> 02:35.616
But not anymore. I am selling 'em.

02:35.649 --> 02:37.017
You know what?

02:37.051 --> 02:39.353
I am gonna set up my table at the Met.

02:39.386 --> 02:40.421
Ooh, yes!

02:40.454 --> 02:41.522
This is perfect.

02:41.555 --> 02:42.623
Can you set up with me?

02:42.656 --> 02:43.891
Uh, totally.

02:43.924 --> 02:46.226
I just have to meet up
with my dad for pedicures.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.895
Oh, I thought that
you said that you were

02:47.928 --> 02:49.363
doing the ice skating
with your mom today.

02:49.396 --> 02:52.199
Whole... family day planned.

02:52.232 --> 02:53.934
I just gotta make sure
that I find the time

02:53.968 --> 02:57.504
for a powerful genital sneeze, or four.

02:57.538 --> 02:59.473
'Cause I'm a cum kween!

02:59.506 --> 03:01.408
I just have to come sometimes.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.944
Like today, so fucking
much, so maybe you guys

03:03.978 --> 03:06.677
can get the fuck out so
I can jerk off real quick.

03:08.182 --> 03:09.550
- What?
- What?

03:09.583 --> 03:11.385
I'm okay.

03:11.418 --> 03:12.353
I'm okay.

03:13.587 --> 03:15.556
Am I allowed to behave that way?

Ooh! So much better.

03:31.205 --> 03:33.107
I think it's warmer out here
than it is in my apartment.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.775
I can finally feel my toes.

03:34.808 --> 03:36.510
Yeah, I love these knishes,

all pressed up on me and that
heat, you feel that steam.

So how much do you have to
sell to get that space heater?

03:41.882 --> 03:44.452
Well, with the BB&B coupon,
it comes to, like, 69 bucks...

03:44.485 --> 03:45.987
Oh, horny number!

Ooh, yowza, love it!

All right.

03:49.757 --> 03:51.158
Gotta run to my, uh, hair appointment.

03:51.192 --> 03:52.326
Uh, nice to see you.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.728
I thought you said you
were getting pedicures

03:53.761 --> 03:55.563
and going ice skating with your parents.

03:55.596 --> 03:59.634
Yes, and... and then
haircuts, with Eliot.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.969
It's kinda like the
Wexlers Take Manhattan.

04:02.003 --> 04:03.871
We actually call it that.

04:03.904 --> 04:06.140
- It's cute.
- Yeah. Totally.

04:06.173 --> 04:07.775
Hey, new blood.

04:07.808 --> 04:09.076
Welcome to the steps.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.144
I'm Margo.

04:10.177 --> 04:11.245
Hey.

04:11.278 --> 04:12.580
Would you like a hit of some soup?

04:12.613 --> 04:14.081
- Wow.
- Homemade lentil.

04:14.115 --> 04:16.117
Oh, my goddess. You two
have the same thermos.

04:16.149 --> 04:17.985
Oh, wow, that's... that's neat.

04:18.019 --> 04:19.654
Same wheelie cart, too.

04:19.687 --> 04:21.422
Soul sisters.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.624
What a hot coincidence.

04:23.658 --> 04:25.593
Well, it's actually
the only one where...

04:25.626 --> 04:27.128
...the wheels don't turn to squares

04:27.161 --> 04:29.563
when you roll over snow salt.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.098
That was spooky.

04:31.132 --> 04:34.402
Cute cards, Young Abbi.

04:34.435 --> 04:35.970
You're gonna be a hit here.

04:36.003 --> 04:37.238
Thanks.

04:37.271 --> 04:40.074
That Margo's a mighty witch.

04:40.107 --> 04:42.810
She nearly gave me a
clit, throat and butt-gasm.

04:42.843 --> 04:43.978
Butt-gasm?

04:44.011 --> 04:45.746
I'm a crazy, sick sex addict,

04:45.780 --> 04:48.115
like David Duchovny in
that show, and in real life.

04:48.149 --> 04:49.850
Ilana, you're being really weird.

04:49.884 --> 04:51.252
Oh, I gotta... run.

04:51.285 --> 04:53.187
My annual family massage appointment.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.690
Damn, I am so horned up, dude.

04:55.723 --> 04:57.958
Better jerk off before
I get on the subway.

04:57.992 --> 04:59.093
Ew, Ilana, chill.

Hi. Thanks.

05:15.743 --> 05:17.244
Beautiful apartment.

05:17.278 --> 05:19.914
Is this, um, pre...
pre-war, or... yeah.

05:19.947 --> 05:22.883
Yeah, I've lived here 50 years.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.151
Wow.

05:24.185 --> 05:27.154
There's a lot of history in these walls.

05:27.188 --> 05:29.190
So cozy.

05:29.223 --> 05:31.158
Wow, you can keep plants alive.

05:31.192 --> 05:33.294
- You're an adult.
- Yeah.

05:33.327 --> 05:35.162
Go on in, don't be shy.

05:41.102 --> 05:42.503
So, Ilana...

05:42.536 --> 05:44.205
Show me your vulva.

05:47.045 --> 05:51.283
So basically, I've had more sex than,
like, anybody in the entire world.

05:51.316 --> 05:55.721
Not just average sex, but,
like, dank '70s porno sex.

05:55.754 --> 05:58.223
I can squirt, and like, spray.

05:58.256 --> 06:00.325
I leave a cum trail wherever I go,

06:00.359 --> 06:02.060
kind of like a slutty slug.

06:02.094 --> 06:03.328
Uh-huh.

06:03.362 --> 06:06.064
I'm just really on the
edge of orgasm at all times.

06:06.098 --> 06:09.301
So then what seems to
be your problem today?

06:09.334 --> 06:11.103
It's not, uh, my problem,

06:11.136 --> 06:13.872
it is my friend Abbi's problem,

06:13.905 --> 06:16.908
so I'm just here for her by proxy.

06:16.942 --> 06:22.314
She hasn't, uh, orgasmed in months.

06:22.347 --> 06:27.552
And she's too embarrassed to
come, L-O-L, here, to see you.

06:27.586 --> 06:30.622
I just want to help her be a cum kween

06:30.656 --> 06:32.291
like her best friend, me, is.

06:32.324 --> 06:36.662
So your friend hasn't come in
months and you're here for her.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.397
Exactly.

06:43.268 --> 06:45.003
Okay.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.239
If that's what you want to do.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.815
- How's business, Young Abbi?
- Oh, my God.

06:56.848 --> 07:00.285
Um, it's going okay.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.187
I've only made five bucks so far.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.423
Would you like a puff of my wand?

07:04.456 --> 07:05.657
It's pretty magical.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.459
Uh, sure.

07:07.492 --> 07:08.627
Cool wand.

07:09.928 --> 07:11.563
You seem cold.

07:11.596 --> 07:14.333
You know, most people
don't realize this,

07:14.366 --> 07:17.202
but you lose most of your body heat

07:17.235 --> 07:18.603
from your upper wing area.

07:18.637 --> 07:21.907
Wing area? Oh, I just...

07:21.940 --> 07:23.608
Oh, wow.

07:23.642 --> 07:25.510
That feels really good, actually.

07:25.544 --> 07:26.511
Yeah, thank you.

07:26.545 --> 07:28.113
All right, well....

07:28.146 --> 07:29.848
Holler if you need anything else.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.516
It's lunchtime.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.752
I guess it is lunchtime.

07:35.687 --> 07:37.923
Hey! Same Tupperware!

07:37.956 --> 07:39.224
Oh, yeah.

07:39.257 --> 07:40.926
Uh, twinsies, I guess.

07:44.062 --> 07:47.132
Beautiful, isn't she?

07:47.165 --> 07:48.800
Straight up gorgeous.

07:48.834 --> 07:51.937
Ilana, I want you to name your vulva.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.806
What about... "Abbi"?

07:56.008 --> 07:57.309
All right, Ilana,

07:57.342 --> 07:59.811
I want you to have a
conversation with Abbi.

07:59.845 --> 08:02.180
Tell Abbi how you've
been feeling lately.

08:02.214 --> 08:04.116
Abbi...

08:04.149 --> 08:07.085
you've been stubborn lately.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.787
Like, withholding.

08:08.820 --> 08:09.955
You're so full of shit.

08:09.988 --> 08:12.724
You can't even focus enough to relax.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.793
You're not even a vulva or a vagina.

08:14.826 --> 08:16.895
You're just a butthole
that happens to bleed.

08:16.928 --> 08:18.897
I fucking hate you, bitch! Fuck you!

08:18.930 --> 08:22.701
It's okay. It's just
the first layer: rage.

08:22.734 --> 08:23.869
Go deeper.

08:23.902 --> 08:25.304
Tell Abbi what's in your heart.

08:26.571 --> 08:29.308
Abbi, I...

08:29.341 --> 08:30.976
I know it's not you.

08:31.009 --> 08:32.277
It's me.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.179
I increased my dosage
of antidepressants.

08:35.212 --> 08:37.381
And I've also just been
more anxious and depressed,

08:37.416 --> 08:41.285
this whole disgusting, gross year.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.654
And now I have dead pussy.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.657
Dead pussy.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.426
Dead pussy.

08:47.459 --> 08:48.794
Dead pussy.

08:48.827 --> 08:50.262
It's essentially dead.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.302
Dead pussy.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.837
How about a little hug for the Donald?

08:58.870 --> 08:59.905
It's like a magnet.

08:59.938 --> 09:01.540
Grab 'em by the pussy.

09:01.573 --> 09:03.976
Grab 'em by the pussy.

09:04.009 --> 09:07.479
USA! USA! USA!

09:07.512 --> 09:09.681
Grab 'em... Grab 'em by the pussy.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.149
I won. I won.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.250
Let's go, ladies.

09:12.284 --> 09:14.286
Oh, my God!

09:14.319 --> 09:16.822
Game show president *** in chief!

09:16.855 --> 09:18.523
I haven't come since the election!

09:18.557 --> 09:20.359
And come is a lot of who I am.

09:20.392 --> 09:22.260
I'm a cum kween.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.829
Oh, good.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.831
Let it out, Ilana.

09:25.864 --> 09:27.633
You're not alone.

09:27.666 --> 09:31.770
Orgasms have been down 140%
since Trump was elected.

09:31.803 --> 09:32.871
Ugh!

09:32.904 --> 09:34.272
It's been horrible for everyone.

09:34.306 --> 09:36.074
Great for me, though.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.777
I'm technically the
only small business owner

09:38.810 --> 09:41.246
that that human skin
tag has ever helped.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.284
Betty, can you help me?

09:49.354 --> 09:51.056
Oh.

09:52.424 --> 09:54.026
Oh, um, you have a little...

09:54.059 --> 09:55.027
It's a gray!

09:55.060 --> 09:56.361
Uh, no. On your nose.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.730
Here. Take a look.

09:59.931 --> 10:02.534
Oh, it's a... It's a lentil.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.336
It's a lentil from way... earlier.

10:04.369 --> 10:05.737
I don't know how that got up there.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.339
It's not a wart.

10:07.372 --> 10:08.507
Huh.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.208
Did you really do all of these yourself?

10:10.242 --> 10:11.810
Oh, yes, I'm... I'm the artist.

10:11.843 --> 10:13.645
I went to this small school called MICA.

10:13.679 --> 10:14.680
Get out.

10:14.713 --> 10:17.049
My daughter goes to MICA.

10:17.082 --> 10:18.717
Sorry, but how old are you?

10:18.750 --> 10:21.086
- I'm 51.
- What?!

10:21.119 --> 10:23.355
Wait, you're 51. Fuck you.

10:23.388 --> 10:25.724
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
You're 51 years old?

10:25.757 --> 10:27.993
I get that a lot. I'm a dermatologist.

10:28.026 --> 10:30.228
An Upper East Side dermatologist,

10:30.262 --> 10:31.296
if you catch my drift.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.099
Yeah, okay, I see.

10:34.132 --> 10:35.801
But what do you mean by that?

10:35.834 --> 10:38.537
Let's just say I can get my
hands on whatever a girl needs

10:38.570 --> 10:40.472
to stay fresh and young-looking.

10:40.505 --> 10:43.308
Botox, fillers, bat feces.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.444
Ew, wait. Fillers?

10:45.477 --> 10:46.979
I tell you what.

10:47.012 --> 10:48.780
I'm gonna take five
stacks of these cards.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.515
My clients are gonna love them.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.117
Wow, okay. Cool.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.352
Um, that's awesome.

10:53.385 --> 10:54.786
That'll be 50 bucks.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.688
Ugh! And what a steal.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.357
That's, like, free.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.926
Yeah, it's nothing for me, either.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.527
That's my business card.

11:02.561 --> 11:03.862
My office is just around the corner,

11:03.895 --> 11:06.999
you know, if you're ever in
the mood to... freshen up.

11:07.032 --> 11:08.533
Oh.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.002
I'm still in my 20s.

11:10.035 --> 11:11.503
I mean, the gray is super premature,

11:11.536 --> 11:14.172
and the hunchback is just
a scarf to protect my wings.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.173
No pressure.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.942
Okay, thanks.

11:18.076 --> 11:20.712
I went to MICA, too!

11:20.746 --> 11:22.281
You could hear all that?

11:22.314 --> 11:23.649
Spooky.

11:32.491 --> 11:33.725
Ugh!

11:33.759 --> 11:35.727
I think I'm just... broken.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.796
You look perfectly healthy to me.

11:37.829 --> 11:40.599
Then why aren't I coming yesterday?

11:40.632 --> 11:42.467
Orgasms are a journey.

11:42.501 --> 11:43.802
They start in your mind.

11:43.835 --> 11:45.771
You're traumatized by the fact

11:45.804 --> 11:49.641
that a sexual-assault
bragging steak salesman

11:49.675 --> 11:51.043
has become our president.

11:51.076 --> 11:55.080
You need to find a way to
rise above it in spite of him.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.949
Look inside yourself.

12:03.822 --> 12:05.157
Ew! Wait! Ugh!

12:05.190 --> 12:07.893
God, I'm never gonna come again!

12:07.926 --> 12:09.594
It's not going to be easy.

12:09.628 --> 12:10.662
Stay in the moment.

12:12.097 --> 12:13.966
Fuck you, Trump!

12:13.999 --> 12:16.001
I'm going back in.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.972
That's not too bad.

12:20.005 --> 12:23.408
Oh, my God. Abbi?

12:23.442 --> 12:25.644
Jeremy?

12:35.621 --> 12:37.923
- I thought that was you.
- Hey! Hi!

12:37.956 --> 12:39.224
How's it going, man?

12:39.257 --> 12:40.492
"Man"?

12:40.525 --> 12:41.760
Natalie, this is Abbi, my old neighbor.

12:41.793 --> 12:43.028
"Old"?

12:43.061 --> 12:44.196
Hi, Zabby!

12:44.229 --> 12:46.231
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

12:46.264 --> 12:47.733
And this is Milo.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.168
Yeah.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.536
He adopted us.

12:51.570 --> 12:52.838
Wow.

12:52.871 --> 12:54.539
Congrats.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.542
I mean, and you're married,
that's... that's awesome.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.077
Oh, no, no, no.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.679
No, no, we're not married.

13:00.712 --> 13:02.114
She's not my property.

13:02.147 --> 13:03.615
- No, yeah.
- No, no.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.251
We're best friends. Soul mates.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.252
Co-parents.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.654
Wow.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.689
Um, yeah, obviously, you're not married.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.958
This is not what I do for a living.

13:12.991 --> 13:15.294
This is... I lost a bet, so that's why.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.296
Nice cards.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.830
Babe, we should get some.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.899
"Thank you" cards, for the
Planned Parenthood fundraiser.

13:20.932 --> 13:22.134
Oh, my God, that's a great idea.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.903
- These are great, Abbi.
- Thanks.

13:24.936 --> 13:27.272
Oh, I guess we need 'em all.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.974
How much do you want for all of these?

13:29.007 --> 13:31.543
Oh, uh... This... This...

13:31.576 --> 13:34.279
Like, uh, 80 bucks would be good?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.380
Totally reasonable.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.684
And I love helping struggling artists.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.485
Actually, you know what? Keep it.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.522
No, I don't... I can't. A hundred bucks?

13:43.555 --> 13:46.825
Okay, I mean that's...
That's a fair price.

13:46.858 --> 13:48.827
God, it's crazy running into you.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.063
Stay warm. Good to see you.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.931
You too, family.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.533
Say bye, Milo!

13:58.637 --> 14:01.874
I should be pounding that ass tonight.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.884
Hey, Margo, can you
watch my stuff for a sec?

14:11.917 --> 14:13.352
I got money to spend.

14:13.385 --> 14:14.987
Money is a mind control technique

14:15.020 --> 14:17.289
that quantifies the
progress of the patriarchy!

14:18.223 --> 14:19.391
Yeah, I'll watch your stuff.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.093
Okay. Thanks.

14:22.828 --> 14:23.929
An average-sized dick...

14:23.962 --> 14:25.130
Yes.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.865
Electoral college!

14:26.899 --> 14:29.568
Come on.

14:29.601 --> 14:32.471
Fat titties.

14:32.504 --> 14:33.839
Mike Pence!

14:33.872 --> 14:35.741
Focus, focus...

14:37.309 --> 14:40.312
Hairy taints...

14:40.346 --> 14:42.848
Tiny, tiny hands!

14:42.881 --> 14:44.083
Push through.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.517
Tap in.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.052
You are powerful.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.053
You are woman.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.288
Yes.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.724
You... are... cum kween!

14:51.757 --> 14:53.993
Yes. No!

14:54.026 --> 14:55.094
Yes.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.898
When they go low, we go high.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.234
Women can get stuff done.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.750
He can never, ever
take away our cumming.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.852
Yes. Yes.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.445
Aah!

15:24.884 --> 15:26.186
Looking good.

15:26.219 --> 15:27.987
Just let that sink
in for a little longer

15:28.021 --> 15:29.422
before we hit the other side.

15:29.455 --> 15:32.692
So, uh, this is what you use personally

15:32.725 --> 15:33.760
to look so young, right?

15:33.793 --> 15:35.628
That and 20 of its cousins.

15:35.662 --> 15:37.931
It's hard to be beautiful these days.

15:37.964 --> 15:40.567
It is my full-time job,
but for most other women,

15:40.600 --> 15:44.637
it's their second full-time
job where you're losing money.

15:44.671 --> 15:48.341
Anyway, while you're here,
can I do a little peel or...

15:48.374 --> 15:49.809
No, I... I don't need...

15:49.843 --> 15:51.945
Obviously, your chin is of concern.

15:51.978 --> 15:53.213
I thought I... I had a...

15:53.246 --> 15:55.648
like, a Reese Witherspoon chin.

15:55.682 --> 15:57.650
Or, I can make you whiter.

15:57.684 --> 15:59.652
Uh...

15:59.686 --> 16:01.688
You know what?

16:01.721 --> 16:05.091
I think that I'm, um... I'm okay.

16:05.124 --> 16:06.593
I think I'm good with just this one.

16:06.626 --> 16:08.528
This feels like a big deal.

16:08.561 --> 16:11.231
But that first side
hasn't settled yet, so...

16:11.264 --> 16:13.199
Yeah. Um...

16:13.233 --> 16:15.268
I'm feeling like I made
a little bit of a mistake.

16:15.301 --> 16:18.805
I found a gray hair and then
I ran into an ex of mine today,

16:18.838 --> 16:21.441
and I think I just got, like,
real swept up in that moment.

16:21.474 --> 16:25.211
'Cause I actually really like
the way that I look, you know?

16:25.245 --> 16:27.647
I think I'm really hot.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.383
Usually. I usually feel super hot.

16:30.416 --> 16:32.785
But thank you so much.
You've been so kind to me.

16:32.819 --> 16:34.554
Um...

16:34.587 --> 16:36.089
And you know what?

16:36.122 --> 16:38.191
I think you're really beautiful.

16:38.224 --> 16:39.826
And I think that you would be

16:39.859 --> 16:42.090
even if you didn't do any of
this crazy shit to your face.

16:44.931 --> 16:47.634
Oh, no. I laughed.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.543
Hey, drink up.

16:56.576 --> 17:00.246
You lost a lot of fluids
during that humongous orgasm.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.149
It's mostly weed, a little
ginger and some cumin.

17:03.183 --> 17:04.717
It's really good.

17:04.751 --> 17:05.919
I think I'm gonna cÃ¼m again.

17:08.755 --> 17:10.589
Yes!

17:10.623 --> 17:12.724
The floodgates are open now.

17:12.759 --> 17:15.361
You've got a lot of orgasming
to do after a year of

17:15.395 --> 17:17.262
Trump-related pussy constipation.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.965
I hate to 'gaz and dash,

17:19.999 --> 17:23.036
but I want to go tell Abbi
what "Abbi" accomplished today.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.436
Good.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.039
I can't thank you
enough for helping m...

17:26.071 --> 17:27.540
Oh...

17:27.574 --> 17:29.409
Ooh, it's happening again!

17:29.442 --> 17:30.410
Oh!

17:30.443 --> 17:32.679
It's gonna be a big one!

17:32.712 --> 17:34.380
Oh!

17:34.414 --> 17:36.683
I'm gonna have to get
these rugs cleaned.

17:39.219 --> 17:42.589
- Oh, Abbi?
- Ilana?

17:42.622 --> 17:45.325
Oh, my God, this timing is weird.

17:45.358 --> 17:47.293
- Are you sweating?
- What happened to your face?

17:47.327 --> 17:49.963
Well, I ran into Jeremy
and he's, like, married now.

17:49.996 --> 17:52.832
And then there was this dermatologist and
she looked like she was in her twenties,

17:52.866 --> 17:54.426
- but she was, like, in her fifties.
- Hot.

17:54.434 --> 17:56.269
And then I just felt
like it's cooler to be,

17:56.303 --> 17:57.971
like, hot and young than warm,

17:58.004 --> 18:00.440
but then as the Botox was
being injected into my face,

18:00.473 --> 18:02.075
I was like, it's...
it's cooler to be warm.

18:02.108 --> 18:03.977
Botox? Abbi, what?

18:04.010 --> 18:06.780
Oh, my God, my table's gone!

18:08.448 --> 18:09.749
Oh, my God!

18:09.783 --> 18:12.118
- Dude.
- Dude.

18:14.855 --> 18:16.523
"Dear Young Abbi,

18:16.556 --> 18:18.725
"at the start of the
winter solstice tonight,

18:18.758 --> 18:20.594
"come into the thicket of the park.

18:20.627 --> 18:22.696
You'll know when you've arrived."

18:22.729 --> 18:26.666
Oh, God, that is witchy!

18:26.700 --> 18:28.268
Are you all right?

18:28.301 --> 18:31.571
I'm phenomenal.

18:31.605 --> 18:34.074
So my pussy hadn't
popped since the election.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.108
What?

18:35.141 --> 18:36.743
But Betty coached me through it.

18:36.776 --> 18:40.280
She tapped me into this
ferocious female current

18:40.313 --> 18:44.584
that is just constantly
zip-zap-zoppin'

18:44.618 --> 18:47.754
around the universe
like the speed of light,

18:47.787 --> 18:49.890
and I bazinga'd.

18:49.923 --> 18:52.926
- Hard.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.195
It was just the most incredible thing.

18:55.228 --> 18:57.297
I saw shit, man.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.199
Witches who run the world.

18:59.232 --> 19:01.652
And witches aren't
monsters, they're just women.

19:01.653 --> 19:04.804
- Yes.
- They're fucking women who cum and giggle

19:04.838 --> 19:06.573
and play in the night.

19:06.606 --> 19:08.308
And that's why everybody
wants to set 'em on fire,

19:08.341 --> 19:09.743
'cause they're so fucking jealous.

19:09.776 --> 19:10.877
Dude, I don't know
why I ever doubted you.

19:10.911 --> 19:12.512
I'm in.

19:19.619 --> 19:21.821
Do you... do you hear that?

19:21.855 --> 19:23.723
I think it's this way.

19:23.757 --> 19:25.825
I've never seen this
part of the park before.

19:30.897 --> 19:32.699
What the frig?

19:34.801 --> 19:37.170
This is, like, "The Crucible"
and "The Witches of Eastwick,"

19:37.204 --> 19:39.506
and Hillary Clinton
getting caught in the woods!

19:39.539 --> 19:41.741
Ah.

19:41.775 --> 19:44.010
Cum kween.

19:44.044 --> 19:46.279
Betty!

19:46.313 --> 19:47.514
Young Abbi!

19:47.547 --> 19:48.949
You found us!

19:48.982 --> 19:50.517
Ilana...

19:50.550 --> 19:52.352
Maybe we really are witches.

19:52.385 --> 19:53.486
Of course we are.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.623
We're gigantic, humongous witches.

19:56.656 --> 19:57.937
- Join us.
- Oh, my God.

19:57.972 --> 19:59.492
Margo, you are just...

19:59.526 --> 20:00.861
Uh, you know what?

20:00.894 --> 20:03.096
I gotta go see about a girl.

20:04.264 --> 20:06.166
Please.

20:19.346 --> 20:20.347
Hey.

20:29.155 --> 20:30.390
Hey, Ilana.

20:30.423 --> 20:32.859
It's period blood!

20:46.566 --> 20:48.332
I'm gonna cum!

20:50.622 --> 20:52.372
Thank you so much for
buying me the heater.

20:52.405 --> 20:53.606
Of course, dude.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.708
Witches have to have each other's backs.

20:55.742 --> 20:58.344
What are you gonna do now that
you know you have magical powers?

20:58.378 --> 21:02.148
Well, I think I'm gonna
whip up a spell to get a job.

21:02.181 --> 21:03.616
Good call.

21:03.650 --> 21:06.953
It is so bananas that you got Botox.

21:06.986 --> 21:08.821
Yeah, it is.

21:08.855 --> 21:11.357
But to be for real, I'm like,

21:11.391 --> 21:13.860
I would get it if I wanted
it at some point in my life.

21:13.893 --> 21:15.261
Exactly.

21:15.295 --> 21:17.999
I also heard about this thing
where you can freeze your butt.

21:18.034 --> 21:18.798
They do that?

21:18.831 --> 21:21.935
Apparently, it makes it really
hard and shiny and grippable.

21:21.968 --> 21:24.170
Like a bowling ball, baby, yas.

21:24.203 --> 21:25.505
So what are you doing back there?

21:25.538 --> 21:27.574
'Cause it's just, like,
the one gray, right?

21:27.607 --> 21:30.009
Oh, yeah, just the one.

21:30.043 --> 21:33.146
Thousand.

21:33.179 --> 21:34.514
Cool.

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
