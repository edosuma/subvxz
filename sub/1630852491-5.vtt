with each other in the past.

Uh, we're both very single,

07:48.647 --> 07:50.251

your temperature

07:53.757 --> 07:55.996
I mean, I could go either way.

07:56.029 --> 07:57.265
It'd be nice to know, though,

07:57.298 --> 07:59.035

08:05.581 --> 08:07.752
Did I ask you with that in mind?

08:07.785 --> 08:10.224
No, but then‐then you said,

Ooh, the branzino.
That's a sexy fish.

09:03.497 --> 09:05.434
Okay, and after that,
I'm thinking maybe we

09:05.467 --> 09:07.505
‐do a little dancing.
What? What?
‐No. No.

09:07.538 --> 09:09.108
I'm gonna have to burst
this fantasy bubble

09:09.142 --> 09:10.311
before I get too depressed.

09:10.344 --> 09:12.248
We can't do tomorrow night.

09:12.281 --> 09:15.387
Sí, se puede.
We can, and we must. Why? Why?

09:15.421 --> 09:18.260
Um, because Deja said that
Malik is in town for 24 hours

09:18.293 --> 09:20.264
and wants to have dinner
with us tomorrow night‐‐

09:20.297 --> 09:23.203
Correction, make dinner for us
tomorrow night.

09:23.237 --> 09:24.639
He wants to make us dinner?

09:24.672 --> 09:26.643
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐What's his game?

09:26.676 --> 09:29.616
I don't know, but it smells
a little branzino to me.

09:29.649 --> 09:31.319
Huh.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.357
Well, maybe it's an apology

09:33.390 --> 09:35.728
for participating
in her secret trip to Boston

09:35.761 --> 09:38.467
and the lying and the... stuff
I don't like to talk about.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.239
I hope it's an apology,
but I don't know.

09:41.273 --> 09:43.744
‐Hmm.
‐Kind of feel like we need to...

09:43.777 --> 09:45.481
"worst case scenario" this bish.

09:45.514 --> 09:47.618
You go.

09:47.652 --> 09:49.455
Okay.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.226
Well, obviously,

09:51.259 --> 09:53.297
‐she's pregnant. Go.
‐(scoffs) God.

09:53.330 --> 09:55.601
‐They went to Vegas...
‐Mm‐hmm.

09:55.634 --> 09:57.772
...and eloped
while we were sleeping.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.377
‐Not preggo,
just married. You go.
‐Okay.

10:00.411 --> 10:03.650
Malik brings out dessert
and there's an engagement ring

10:03.684 --> 10:05.321
in Deja's soufflé,

10:05.354 --> 10:07.625
and he proposes to her
in front of all of us.

10:07.658 --> 10:09.395
He pulls me out
onto the back porch

10:09.429 --> 10:12.668
before he proposes to ask
for permission, and, uh...

10:12.702 --> 10:14.772
I don't know, he chooses
the back porch because

10:14.806 --> 10:17.778
‐we've had some
really good talks out there...
‐Play the game, Randall.

10:17.812 --> 10:19.148
‐Um...
‐(knocks on table)

10:19.182 --> 10:21.419
You go.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.490
Deja wants to adopt
Malik's daughter,

10:23.523 --> 10:26.630
and they move in here together
and live with us forever.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.410
‐We need a new game.
‐Mm‐hmm.

10:42.395 --> 10:44.565
.
‐(sighs)
‐All right. What do you think?

10:44.599 --> 10:46.336
Hat or no hat?

10:46.369 --> 10:48.173
Uh, no hat.

10:48.206 --> 10:50.878
Guys in hats are usually trying
to hide their hair, and you have

10:50.911 --> 10:52.515
‐great hair.
‐Oh.

10:52.548 --> 10:54.152
I really like your curls.

10:54.185 --> 10:55.888
What about my lipstick,
is it too much?

10:55.921 --> 10:59.462
No. (stammers)
You look, um... very nice.

10:59.495 --> 11:01.866
(groans) It's too much.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.337
‐Okay.
‐(sighs)

11:03.370 --> 11:05.708
‐(sighs)
‐All right.

11:05.741 --> 11:08.280
‐You ready for this?
‐Not at all.

11:08.313 --> 11:11.152
‐(bell dings)
‐Okay, let's see, um...

11:11.186 --> 11:13.657
I have three children,

11:13.690 --> 11:15.427
all the same age,

11:15.461 --> 11:18.734
and I currently
live with my daughter.

11:18.767 --> 11:21.406
‐(bell dings)
‐Actually, I'm‐I'm not divorced.

11:21.439 --> 11:23.510
I'm a widow, actually.

11:23.543 --> 11:25.848
I know, sad, sad, sad.

11:25.881 --> 11:27.918
‐(bell dings)
‐There was a fire,

11:27.952 --> 11:30.557
and our whole house
burned down. (chuckles)

11:30.591 --> 11:33.330
We lost almost everything.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.501
‐(bell dings)
‐He didn't even die in the fire.

11:35.534 --> 11:36.836
He died of a heart attack

11:36.870 --> 11:38.373
in the hospital after.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.876
‐(bell dings)
‐He saved the dog. (chuckles)

11:39.909 --> 11:41.780
‐(bell dings)
‐They call it a widowmaker.

11:41.813 --> 11:44.786
‐(bell dings)
‐I wasn't even in the room.
I was eating a candy bar.

11:44.819 --> 11:47.692
‐(bell dings)
‐I don't think I'm doing great.

11:47.725 --> 11:49.762
Yeah, me neither.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.633
Oh, by the way, I'm Miguel,

11:51.666 --> 11:53.470
and I'm divorced.

11:53.503 --> 11:55.808
I live in a different state
from my kids, and they hate me.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.611
Oh, hi, Miguel. I'm Rebecca.

11:57.645 --> 12:00.217
I'm a widow who can't seem

12:00.250 --> 12:02.188
to stop talking
about her husband's death.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.627
‐(bell dings)
‐Oh, um,

12:05.661 --> 12:08.633
if this next one's a dud,
can we just get out of here?

12:08.667 --> 12:10.637
‐Deal. (chuckles)
‐Great.

12:10.671 --> 12:12.508
See you soon.

12:20.557 --> 12:23.363
‐REBECCA: Hi.
‐Rebecca.

12:23.397 --> 12:24.532
Matt Dickson,

12:24.565 --> 12:26.803
from the PTA.

12:26.836 --> 12:28.640
It's nice to see you again.

12:28.673 --> 12:30.444
It's good to see you, too.

12:30.477 --> 12:32.448
How are you?

12:32.481 --> 12:33.583
(laughs)

12:33.617 --> 12:35.387
Okay, so, today is officially

12:35.421 --> 12:38.360
‐take most of your family
to work day.
‐(laughs)

12:38.393 --> 12:39.962
I brought Jack

12:39.997 --> 12:43.670
‐and Hailey and my mom, Rebecca.
‐Hi.

12:43.703 --> 12:47.445
Yeah, and she's actually
a really great piano player.

12:47.478 --> 12:50.284
‐I'm okay. (chuckles)
‐KATE: No, she's really great.

12:50.317 --> 12:52.822
So, I figured, for our
jam session today, we could have

12:52.855 --> 12:55.861
a guest musician.
What do you think, Mom?

12:58.300 --> 13:01.039
Oh, my God.
They're gonna kill you.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.942
When are you gonna tell them?

13:02.975 --> 13:04.812
We're thinking
right before dessert.

13:04.846 --> 13:06.416
Malik's making blueberry pie.

13:06.449 --> 13:07.284
Smart.

13:07.318 --> 13:08.687
You got to butter
them up beforehand.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.956
Stroke their egos a little bit.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.294
Ask about Dad's addiction
initiative thing.

13:12.328 --> 13:13.563
He loves talking about that.

13:13.597 --> 13:15.667
Annie, you still got
knock‐knock jokes?

13:15.701 --> 13:17.705
I feel like I've aged out
of knock‐knock jokes.

13:17.738 --> 13:21.613
Well, if I need help,
I'll give you the signal, okay?

13:21.646 --> 13:23.817
(footsteps approaching)

13:26.456 --> 13:27.958
What are you ladies
conferencing about?

13:27.993 --> 13:29.997
‐Algebra.
‐Knock‐knock jokes.
‐Nothing.

13:30.030 --> 13:32.334
Oh, I miss your
knock‐knock jokes, Annie.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.872
‐(phone rings)
‐Hey, brother of mine.

13:34.906 --> 13:36.709
(front door opens, closes)

13:36.743 --> 13:39.081
KEVIN:
Hey, so I'm in a car
headed to the mom house.

13:39.115 --> 13:40.985
Uncle Nicky's there
on the ground floor,

13:41.019 --> 13:42.955
and Cassidy's coming
this weekend, so...

13:42.989 --> 13:44.325
RANDALL:
Whoa, war vet Cassidy?

13:44.358 --> 13:45.360
Like, Nicky threw
a chair at her,

13:45.394 --> 13:46.629
and then you slept with her?

13:46.663 --> 13:48.366
Well, I mean,
that's a bit reductive,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.602
but... yeah, her.

13:49.635 --> 13:51.339
Oh, man, I did not
see that one coming.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.877
Huh. Coming down
the home stretch,

13:53.910 --> 13:55.047
seemingly out of nowhere,

13:55.080 --> 13:56.616
beating out
all the local favorites,

13:56.649 --> 13:58.019
passing Sophie, passing Madison

13:58.053 --> 14:00.491
passing Zoe,
my African‐American cousin.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.428
Can she do it? Yes!

14:02.461 --> 14:05.400
It's Cassidy
by a hundredth of a second.

14:05.434 --> 14:06.936
It's not like that at all.

14:06.970 --> 14:08.740
Believe it or not,
there are people out there

14:08.773 --> 14:10.344
that are capable of having

14:10.377 --> 14:12.882
casual, consensual, you know,

14:12.915 --> 14:14.685
"we're both hot,
so let's just do it" sex.

14:14.719 --> 14:17.892
And you, my brother,
are not one of them.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.063
You try to have
a one‐night stand,

14:20.097 --> 14:22.401
and you wind up with twins.

14:22.434 --> 14:24.906
You are the world's strangest

14:24.939 --> 14:26.776
serial monogamist.

14:26.809 --> 14:28.613
Okay, well, I'm here, so, um,

14:28.647 --> 14:30.751
thank you for the most
useless conversation ever.

14:30.784 --> 14:33.523
Yeah, man. You have fun
at your couples retreat,

14:33.557 --> 14:34.926
and do me a favor.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.763
Try not to propose, okay?

14:36.796 --> 14:38.099
You know how you get.

14:38.133 --> 14:39.969
Thank you, Randall. (chuckles)

14:40.003 --> 14:41.973
(phone beeps)

14:42.007 --> 14:43.877
NICKY:
Hey!

14:43.910 --> 14:45.982
♪

14:46.015 --> 14:47.351
Good to see you.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.096
EDIE:
Married three times,
but they never stuck.

14:53.129 --> 14:55.534
You know, I wasn't
that great at it

14:55.567 --> 14:57.104
because I was always
traveling for work.

14:57.137 --> 14:58.940
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

14:58.974 --> 15:01.412
But I do have two
beautiful children that made

15:01.446 --> 15:03.783
‐the divorces,
you know, worth it.
‐Hmm.

15:03.817 --> 15:05.520
She has three marriages,
and I have none,

15:05.554 --> 15:07.091
so, I think between
the two of us,

15:07.124 --> 15:10.030
‐we almost make a normal person.
‐EDIE (laughs): Yes.

15:11.065 --> 15:12.134
So, what do you think?

15:12.167 --> 15:14.005
Ah, I think she seems

15:14.038 --> 15:15.507
surprisingly lovely.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.811
I mean...

15:17.845 --> 15:19.415
Sometimes I worry, you know.

15:19.448 --> 15:21.753
I mean, she's been
a flight attendant, you know.

15:21.786 --> 15:23.690
She's... you know,

15:23.723 --> 15:25.127
been around all sorts of guys.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.199
‐Oh, well...
‐I just, you know,
sometimes I worry

15:28.233 --> 15:30.837
that maybe I'm just a port
in her storm, you know.

15:30.871 --> 15:32.141
Oh, here's a curveball,

15:32.174 --> 15:34.845
she brought an overnight bag
for tonight.

15:34.879 --> 15:36.683
‐Brought an overnight bag?
‐Mm‐hmm.

15:36.716 --> 15:37.986
Wow. (chuckles)

15:38.019 --> 15:39.589
‐We're going there?
‐Oh, yeah.

15:39.622 --> 15:41.626
Ah, I mean, have you guys
consummated yet, or...?

15:41.659 --> 15:43.630
‐Would you keep your voice down?
‐I'm sorry.

15:43.663 --> 15:44.966
‐No.
‐You know, she's not listening

15:45.000 --> 15:45.867
‐to what we're saying.
‐Shh!

15:45.901 --> 15:47.571
‐Shh!
‐Sorry.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.642
No, we have not.

15:49.675 --> 15:52.047
It's been more than a little
time since I've, you know,

15:52.081 --> 15:54.051
made love to a real, live woman.

15:54.085 --> 15:56.556
A real, live woman?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.860
What do you mean by that?
That's just... Listen.

15:58.893 --> 16:01.165
Just do it. Just do it.

16:01.199 --> 16:02.768
‐Right.
‐I'm sure you'll remember,
you know.

16:02.801 --> 16:05.040
‐It's not that complicated.
‐Right.

16:05.073 --> 16:06.876
Oh, so, what about, uh...

16:06.909 --> 16:08.446
you and Cassidy, uh,

16:08.480 --> 16:09.983
you guys gonna
sleep together this weekend?

16:10.017 --> 16:11.786
(exhales) It's complicated.

16:11.819 --> 16:14.492
Oh, yeah.

16:14.525 --> 16:16.629
Oh, that salad looks great.

16:16.663 --> 16:19.669
‐Yeah, not bad, right?
‐So, you guys met on the plane?

16:19.702 --> 16:20.671
Yes.

16:20.704 --> 16:23.677
He was belligerent
and very, very disruptive.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.883
And she was unhelpful
and unfriendly.

16:26.916 --> 16:28.620
‐Hmm.
‐(chuckles)

16:28.653 --> 16:30.557
Got to love that initial first
spark, you know what I mean?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.861
‐Yeah.
‐I always say my Uncle Nicky's
an acquired taste.

16:32.895 --> 16:33.863
EDIE:
Tell me about it.

16:33.897 --> 16:35.067
Hey, tell‐tell Kevin

16:35.100 --> 16:36.803
what you think of The Manny.

16:36.836 --> 16:38.873
‐Nicky. Nick‐‐
No, that's terrible.
‐Go on, tell him.

16:38.907 --> 16:40.811
‐She hates it.
‐Oh, my God.

16:40.844 --> 16:43.516
‐She hates it. She thinks
it's really dumb.
‐I...

16:43.550 --> 16:45.787
‐So rude. Would you stop...
‐(laughs)

16:45.821 --> 16:47.057
...eating my chicken.

16:47.091 --> 16:50.831
Can my Uncle Nicky
be a closet lady killer?

16:50.864 --> 16:52.234
They're very cute.

16:52.267 --> 16:53.937
‐Can you pass the salad?
‐Yeah.

16:53.970 --> 16:56.175
(indistinct whispering)

16:56.209 --> 16:58.580
‐Thank you.
‐New love.

16:58.613 --> 17:00.517
It's quite nice.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.021
Yeah.

17:11.973 --> 17:14.578
Oh, gosh. Okay, so that's
Randall, that's Kate... Oh, um, and my son, Kevin,

17:14.612 --> 17:17.618
is in Los Angeles
trying to be an actor.

17:17.651 --> 17:18.820
‐An actor?
‐Mm‐hmm.

17:18.853 --> 17:21.259
Wow, and how do you
feel about that?

17:21.292 --> 17:24.598
It seems impossible
to me, but, um...

17:24.632 --> 17:26.302
part of me is just proud that he

17:26.335 --> 17:27.638
has the guts to do it,

17:27.671 --> 17:29.642
‐you know?
‐Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

17:29.675 --> 17:31.579
I wanted to be a detective.

17:31.612 --> 17:34.719
‐Really?
‐Yeah. That was always
my big dream.

17:34.752 --> 17:36.723
Well, you‐you could
still be a detective.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.660
‐You think so?
‐Yeah.

17:38.693 --> 17:40.964
I mean, I don't want to brag,
but I am really good at guessing

17:40.998 --> 17:43.103
‐who did it on Law & Order.
‐(chuckles)

17:43.136 --> 17:45.741
See, I never know who did it.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.346
I always just assume
it's the first person.

17:48.380 --> 17:49.983
No, you‐‐
That's your first problem.

17:50.016 --> 17:51.119
It's never the first person,

17:51.152 --> 17:52.554
and also, it's never the person

17:52.588 --> 17:53.890
that works at the pizzeria.

17:53.923 --> 17:55.093
Ah.

17:55.127 --> 17:56.629
I am learning so much right now.

17:56.662 --> 17:58.900
‐(Matt and Rebecca laugh)
‐(bell dings)

17:58.933 --> 18:00.771
MATT:
Ah...

18:00.804 --> 18:02.908
‐I‐I have to...
‐This was really fun.

18:02.941 --> 18:04.712
It was nice to catch up
with you, Matt.

18:04.745 --> 18:06.783
‐This was nice.
‐Yeah.

18:11.726 --> 18:14.331
Hi. I'm Ren. I like your vibe.

18:14.365 --> 18:17.271
‐Hi. I'm...
‐MATT: Rebecca?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.642
I'm‐I'm so sorry
to interrupt. Uh...

18:19.675 --> 18:21.913
I don't know if the, you know,
speed dating police

18:21.946 --> 18:24.351
are gonna arrest me
for speeding or something,

18:24.385 --> 18:27.157
but I was wondering...

18:27.191 --> 18:29.595
do you want
to get coffee with me

18:29.628 --> 18:31.132
‐after this?
‐Um...

18:31.165 --> 18:33.369
Yeah.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.340
I'd love that.

18:35.373 --> 18:37.945
‐Me, too.
‐REBECCA: Okay. (laughs)

18:39.348 --> 18:41.886
(chuckles)

18:41.919 --> 18:44.725
I have a ferret.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.762
Oh...

18:46.796 --> 18:48.032
WOMAN (on TV):
Seriously?

18:48.066 --> 18:50.070
‐It's like you're Photoshopped.
‐(laughing)

18:50.103 --> 18:51.706
(groans)

18:51.739 --> 18:54.078
You know what?
Makes me nervous just to imagine

18:54.111 --> 18:56.149
what might be going on
under that blanket.

18:56.182 --> 18:58.920
(chuckles)
I'm proud of the old man.

18:58.953 --> 19:01.759
Listen, um...

19:01.793 --> 19:04.031
Would you want to help

19:04.064 --> 19:06.702
Nicky oversee
the construction here

19:06.736 --> 19:09.008
on the days you
don't have Matty? I mean,

19:09.041 --> 19:11.345
‐I could pay you for it.
‐I don't need your charity.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.817
It's not a charity thing.
It's a...

19:13.850 --> 19:15.754
It's a "the contractor
told me that Uncle Nicky

19:15.787 --> 19:17.357
‐threw a stapler at him" thing.
‐(laughs)

19:17.391 --> 19:19.061
And since you,

19:19.094 --> 19:21.933
since you managed classified
operations in Afghanistan,

19:21.966 --> 19:25.373
I figure maybe you could handle
a contractor and my uncle.

19:25.407 --> 19:27.077
I'll think about it.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.682
You'll think about it?
Very good. Well, you think away.

19:29.715 --> 19:31.185
Thinking. Still thinking.

19:31.219 --> 19:32.921
(laughs)

19:35.961 --> 19:37.631
Thank you.

19:40.203 --> 19:41.172
What?

19:41.205 --> 19:43.042
Nothing.

19:45.982 --> 19:48.753
Hey, do you want to go get
ice cream or something?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.859
‐Yeah, sure. Yeah.
‐Yeah?

19:51.893 --> 19:53.730
Let's go.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.704
(sighs)

19:59.041 --> 20:00.844
(water continues pouring)

20:01.779 --> 20:03.850
MALIK:
There you go.

20:03.883 --> 20:05.887
BETH:
Gnocchi looks...

20:05.921 --> 20:08.193
excellent, Malik.

20:08.226 --> 20:10.096
Thank you. Everybody,

20:10.130 --> 20:12.067
please, dig in.

20:19.048 --> 20:20.083
(Beth clears throat)

20:20.116 --> 20:22.254
MALIK:
Um...

20:22.287 --> 20:25.393
We had wanted to apologize

20:25.427 --> 20:27.864
for the weekend
that Deja came to Boston.

20:27.898 --> 20:31.272
We should've handled that
differently for sure.

20:31.305 --> 20:34.178
I know that you guys have
already spoken with Deja, but...

20:34.211 --> 20:36.249
I wanted to get a chance
to look you both in the eyes

20:36.282 --> 20:39.388
and apologize myself as well.

20:39.421 --> 20:41.392
It was definitely
a mutual decision.

20:45.901 --> 20:48.273
Thank you for
saying that, Malik.

20:48.306 --> 20:49.475
And may I just say

20:49.508 --> 20:52.247
that, um... this is

20:52.281 --> 20:54.518
the best butter sauce
I've ever tasted, so...

20:54.551 --> 20:57.124
Thank you. Brown butter.

20:58.293 --> 21:01.299
Um, Mom, how's it going
at the dance studio?

21:01.332 --> 21:03.937
‐I'd love to hear about it.
‐What?
‐That's very nice, Tess.

21:03.970 --> 21:06.842
It's unusually nice, Tess.
Yeah, work is fine.

21:06.876 --> 21:10.050
Busy, finding my way, but...

21:10.083 --> 21:13.489
You know... it's good.
Thanks for asking,

21:13.523 --> 21:15.493
for the very first time ever.

21:18.066 --> 21:20.136
Does anyone want to hear
a knock‐knock joke?

21:20.170 --> 21:22.841
‐Okay, what's going on?
‐RANDALL: Hmm...

21:22.874 --> 21:24.111
‐DEJA: What? What?
‐MALIK: What?

21:24.144 --> 21:25.480
You two are making eyes
at each other,

21:25.513 --> 21:27.184
and not the normal
lovey‐dovey eyes,

21:27.217 --> 21:29.054
okay, it's the
"we're up to something" eyes.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.794
And Tess is showing unusual
interest in things she is

21:32.828 --> 21:34.798
off‐the‐charts uninterested in,
and I ain't heard

21:34.832 --> 21:36.135
a knock‐knock joke in this house
for a clean seven years,

21:36.168 --> 21:38.339
so what's going‐‐
You're tugging your ear.

21:38.373 --> 21:40.243
‐Why's she tugging her ear?
What's tugging that ear?
‐RANDALL: What's she doing?

21:40.276 --> 21:42.014
‐I'm getting a C in Algebra.
‐RANDALL: What?

21:42.047 --> 21:43.316
But you've been working
with a tutor. What the...

21:43.349 --> 21:45.086
It's a tactic. It's all tactics.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.357
‐They're tactics. Spill it.
‐Yeah, you right.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.428
Now.

21:51.098 --> 21:53.870
I'm finishing out
this school semester next month,

21:53.903 --> 21:55.940
and I'm moving to Boston
with Malik.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.858
Knock, knock!

22:21.192 --> 22:23.930
(engine turns off)
‐Thank you for the coffee.
‐Oh, you're welcome.

22:23.963 --> 22:25.467
And I would've sprung
for the muffin.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.137
Oh, the muffin
would've been moving

22:27.170 --> 22:30.010
‐a little too fast
for me, but...
‐(chuckles)

22:30.043 --> 22:32.247
I had a lot of fun.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.251
‐Me, too.
‐Mm.

22:34.284 --> 22:35.988
A‐And next time we go out,

22:36.022 --> 22:38.259
I promise I won't make you date
seven guys beforehand.

22:38.292 --> 22:39.428
(both laughing)

22:39.461 --> 22:41.098
Deal.

22:47.244 --> 22:48.513
I'll call you.

22:48.546 --> 22:50.483
I'd like that.

22:57.030 --> 22:58.900
(engine starts)

‐Hey!
‐KATE: Are you
still on the boat?

23:37.344 --> 23:41.252
No. I'm actually walking back
to the car, and for the record,

23:41.285 --> 23:44.525
it was not a canoe. Legit yacht.

23:44.558 --> 23:47.431
‐Everything okay?
‐Yeah.

23:48.266 --> 23:50.303
No.

23:50.336 --> 23:53.176
We're at the school
with my mom, and she's...

23:53.209 --> 23:54.411
so happy.

23:54.445 --> 23:56.348
W‐We're happy.

23:56.382 --> 23:59.021
Finally in a good place and...

23:59.054 --> 24:01.192
(sighs) It just took
a long time to get here, Tobe.

24:01.225 --> 24:04.364
How many bumps in the road?
Like 30 years of bumps.

24:04.398 --> 24:06.602
We just lost so much time.

24:06.635 --> 24:08.372
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:08.406 --> 24:11.011
You still have time.

24:11.045 --> 24:14.551
Kate, you‐you still have
a lot of time.

24:14.585 --> 24:18.059
‐(applause)
‐REBECCA: Nice. Sounds so good.

24:18.726 --> 24:21.165
But, Tobe, I've got to
tell her tonight.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.136
(sighs) I'm sorry.

24:23.169 --> 24:25.240
I love you so much.

24:25.273 --> 24:27.110
Love you.

24:27.144 --> 24:29.214
Okay. Bye.

24:29.248 --> 24:30.517
Bye.

24:30.550 --> 24:33.122
(Rebecca playing piano)

24:40.203 --> 24:42.507
You're joking, right?

24:42.541 --> 24:46.081
I took on three extra
A. P. classes

24:46.115 --> 24:47.417
this semester,

24:47.450 --> 24:49.421
so, technically, that gives me

24:49.454 --> 24:52.060
enough credits to graduate.

24:52.093 --> 24:54.999
And I can take the G.E.D.
in December,

24:55.033 --> 24:57.470
‐with your permission.
‐Permission not granted.

24:57.504 --> 24:59.474
‐Take a breath, babe.
‐Uh...

24:59.508 --> 25:01.045
You two, go upstairs, please.

25:10.129 --> 25:13.135
Harvard does offer classes
for current high school students

25:13.169 --> 25:15.440
and students that are looking
to take a year off.

25:15.473 --> 25:17.744
It would essentially be
like a gap year,

25:17.777 --> 25:19.448
and then I'd apply
to college in the fall.

25:19.481 --> 25:20.750
Enough.
You don't have to show us

25:20.783 --> 25:22.454
the whole
PowerPoint presentation.

25:22.487 --> 25:24.091
BETH:
You know what, Deja,
you're 17 years old.

25:24.124 --> 25:25.693
You're a junior in high school.

25:25.727 --> 25:27.197
You're not dropping out
to move in

25:27.230 --> 25:29.101
with your boyfriend
in another state.

25:29.134 --> 25:31.672
It wouldn't be dropping out.
It would be graduating early.

25:31.705 --> 25:32.807
MALIK:
I promise, we would be doing

25:32.841 --> 25:34.278
a lot of studying.

25:34.311 --> 25:36.115
I‐I mean, we hold each other
accountable.

25:36.148 --> 25:38.553
‐We encourage each other.
‐(laughs) I bet you do.

25:38.586 --> 25:41.158
‐That's rude.
‐I'm rude?

25:41.192 --> 25:42.694
I'm sorry,
this whole thing is rude.

25:42.727 --> 25:44.331
Y'all are rude.

25:44.364 --> 25:46.769
You are not old enough
to make this kind of decision.

25:46.802 --> 25:50.210
‐Oh, now I'm not old enough?
‐RANDALL: What are you
talking about, man?

25:51.345 --> 25:54.785
All those times you told me
I'm "wise beyond my years"?

25:54.818 --> 25:57.724
(chuckles)
It's because I am, Randall.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.263
I've lived a lot

26:00.296 --> 26:03.836
more life in my 17 years

26:03.869 --> 26:06.742
than a lot of people
twice my age,

26:06.775 --> 26:10.450
and you,
out of anyone in this world,

26:10.483 --> 26:12.187
knows that best.

26:19.501 --> 26:21.472
(chair scrapes)

26:21.505 --> 26:22.774
‐Randall.
‐Hmm?

26:22.807 --> 26:24.278
Can you take a breath
and have a conversation?

26:24.311 --> 26:27.384
‐Can we do that?
‐No, we can't, Beth.

26:27.417 --> 26:30.323
'Cause I have nothing
to say about any of this.

26:32.127 --> 26:34.298
(footsteps departing)

26:49.661 --> 26:51.131
Hi. I thought you were at Molly's.

26:51.165 --> 26:55.673
Aunt Molly was tired.
Whose car was that?

26:55.707 --> 26:59.648
Uh, believe it or not,

26:59.681 --> 27:01.685
I was on a date.

27:01.719 --> 27:04.224
You went on a date?

27:04.257 --> 27:06.195
Well, eh, kind of.
(chuckles)

27:06.228 --> 27:09.801
Miguel and I went and did this
silly speed dating thing,

27:09.835 --> 27:11.872
and I ended up
running into a man

27:11.905 --> 27:13.476
that I actually knew there,

27:13.509 --> 27:15.146
and we went and had some coffee.

27:15.179 --> 27:17.884
You went and got coffee
until, like, 10:00?

27:17.917 --> 27:20.290
You were the one telling me
to get a life.

27:20.323 --> 27:23.362
No, no, I told you to stop
watching that stupid show

27:23.396 --> 27:24.665
with stupid Miguel.

27:24.698 --> 27:27.537
So, what, what, you're,
like, dating now?

27:27.570 --> 27:30.410
Uh, I don't know.

27:30.443 --> 27:34.451
Look, Kate, I know it's weird,

27:34.484 --> 27:37.357
but I have to start to
try to move on.

27:37.390 --> 27:42.534
Oh, right. Move on from Dad,
because he's dead. I'm aware.

27:42.567 --> 27:44.438
I'm sorry.

27:44.471 --> 27:46.175
I'm sorry, yeah. I, I'm‐‐

27:46.208 --> 27:47.510
I should have been a little bit
more sensitive with you

27:47.544 --> 27:49.915
when I brought it up,
but I really believe

27:49.948 --> 27:51.385
that I deserve happiness.

27:51.418 --> 27:52.921
I think it's what
your father would want.

27:52.954 --> 27:54.558
In fact, I know it's what
your father would want.

27:54.591 --> 27:57.564
Oh, by making out with some
random dude you just met?

27:57.597 --> 27:59.301
Okay, you know what?

27:59.334 --> 28:02.374
You are on some thin ice
with me right now, young lady.

28:02.407 --> 28:05.246
That is not what happened, and
maybe one day you'll understand.

28:05.279 --> 28:08.319
No, Mom. No, I won't.
And neither would Dad.

28:08.352 --> 28:11.492
And he wouldn't be happy for you
running around town like a slut!

28:15.600 --> 28:18.205
You don't know what
you're talking about.

28:24.584 --> 28:25.887
(door slams)

28:34.638 --> 28:36.375
‐Mom.
‐Hmm?

28:36.408 --> 28:38.512
Thank you so much for
all of your help today.

28:38.546 --> 28:40.516
Oh, my pleasure.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.287
I had a blast.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.426
And I learned who Doja Cat is.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.664
Not a cat, but a rapper.

28:47.697 --> 28:49.568
(chuckles)

28:49.601 --> 28:51.371
When does Toby get in?

28:51.405 --> 28:53.776
Ah, in an hour.

28:53.809 --> 28:56.014
You know, you both have been
working so hard.

28:56.048 --> 28:57.617
If you ever want to go
have a date night,

28:57.650 --> 28:59.921
or, you know,
go out for the afternoon,

28:59.955 --> 29:03.896
I am so happy to come over
and watch the kids for you.

29:05.566 --> 29:08.639
Actually, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:08.672 --> 29:11.645
Toby and I talked, and...

29:11.678 --> 29:13.649
What? What's wrong?

29:13.682 --> 29:15.988
Well, given your last PET scan,

29:16.021 --> 29:19.694
we just don't feel comfortable
with you taking care

29:19.728 --> 29:21.465
of the kids alone anymore.

29:21.498 --> 29:25.006
We know that you would never
do anything intentionally.

29:25.039 --> 29:26.675
It's just without
another adult around,

29:26.708 --> 29:28.813
we just can't‐‐
Mom, I'm really sorry.

29:28.846 --> 29:32.353
Oh, so that's why you wanted me
to go to school with you today

29:32.387 --> 29:35.426
instead of watching
the kids here.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.797
Not 'cause you actually
wanted me to go with you.

29:38.833 --> 29:40.570
No, I did want you to come.

29:40.603 --> 29:42.841
Okay, um...

29:42.874 --> 29:45.346
I think I'm gonna go home, Kate.

30:03.849 --> 30:05.887
(cracks knuckles)

30:08.559 --> 30:11.064
Apologies for walking out.

30:11.098 --> 30:13.869
Didn't expect that conversation.

30:15.873 --> 30:18.779
(scoffs)
I get it.

30:21.852 --> 30:25.059
You know, you and I have spent
a lot of time together, Malik.

30:26.562 --> 30:30.069
And, uh, I feel like

30:30.102 --> 30:33.676
I've tried to impart
some wisdom to you.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.413
No, you‐you've been great to me.

30:35.446 --> 30:37.650
And you're on a path, man.

30:37.684 --> 30:41.058
You are on a great path.

30:45.600 --> 30:49.641
Deja needs to find
her own path now, Malik.

30:49.674 --> 30:53.549
She's got two big years
ahead of her.

30:53.582 --> 30:58.425
Two years that could determine
the rest of her life.

31:00.998 --> 31:03.569
You need to end it, Malik.

31:03.602 --> 31:05.139
‐You need to do it for her.
‐What?

31:05.172 --> 31:07.644
I'm not gonna...
I love her.

31:07.677 --> 31:09.614
If you really love her, man,
then you will do

31:09.648 --> 31:11.418
what is best for her.

31:11.451 --> 31:15.026
But leaving school,
leaving her home...

31:15.059 --> 31:16.662
Moving six hours away.

31:16.695 --> 31:20.536
Moving in with an 18‐year‐old
and his daughter.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.776
That is not what's best
for her, man.

31:23.809 --> 31:27.584
You are a very smart young man.
You know that.

31:36.969 --> 31:38.806
I'm gonna go ahead
and not tell Deja

31:38.839 --> 31:42.013
about this conversation.

31:42.046 --> 31:45.419
Because I really do love her.

31:45.453 --> 31:49.427
And I care about you all's
relationship.

31:49.461 --> 31:52.667
And I can promise you she would
not feel good about this.

31:59.047 --> 32:02.120
I'm just saying,
Bubble Gum is...

32:02.153 --> 32:04.024
I've just never seen anyone
over the age of nine

32:04.057 --> 32:05.526
order that before.

32:05.559 --> 32:06.862
It's the universal worst
flavor of ice cream.

32:06.895 --> 32:10.670
Well, maybe I like an underdog.

32:14.711 --> 32:16.181
What are you doing?

32:16.214 --> 32:20.089
I'm sorry, I thought we said
that was on the table.

32:20.122 --> 32:21.658
I said I might want
to have sex with you.

32:21.692 --> 32:23.429
I didn't say I wanted
to hold your hand.

32:23.462 --> 32:25.399
O‐Okay.

32:26.735 --> 32:28.572
Wait, hold‐‐ Why?

32:28.606 --> 32:32.714
Yes, we did, we came together
in a time of loneliness

32:32.747 --> 32:34.651
and‐and addiction.

32:34.684 --> 32:36.655
But what if...

32:36.688 --> 32:39.894
What if that inner darkness
actually turned out to be

32:39.928 --> 32:41.665
something kind of wonderful?

32:41.698 --> 32:45.673
You've watched too many
rom‐coms, Kevin.

32:45.706 --> 32:48.012
I think you're scared.

32:48.045 --> 32:49.581
I...
(inhales sharply)

32:51.785 --> 32:57.463
There's no reality to
a relationship working with us.

32:57.497 --> 33:01.138
Your kids are in L. A.
My kid is in Pennsylvania.

33:01.171 --> 33:02.740
I know that, but look,
you and I obviously

33:02.774 --> 33:03.776
have a connection.

33:03.809 --> 33:06.214
It's a false equivalency, Kevin.

33:08.118 --> 33:12.727
Your inner darkness...
(clears throat)

33:12.760 --> 33:14.264
is not the same as mine.

33:14.297 --> 33:16.835
Have you noticed that when
you text at 3:00 in the morning,

33:16.868 --> 33:18.505
I'm always awake?

33:20.276 --> 33:25.619
Our darknesses are not the same.

33:27.156 --> 33:32.734
You are chasing the wrong blonde
in the wrong city.

33:32.767 --> 33:34.170
And if you want

33:34.204 --> 33:38.112
that rom‐com love story,

33:38.145 --> 33:40.716
you should go make things
right with her.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.257
I'm not even sure I know which
blonde you're talking about,

33:44.290 --> 33:45.292
to be honest with you.

33:45.326 --> 33:48.132
You see how that's a problem?

33:48.165 --> 33:50.202
‐Yeah.
‐Aw, Kevin,

33:50.236 --> 33:51.738
you've been blowing up
women's lives

33:51.772 --> 33:54.144
for the better part of
two decades.

33:54.177 --> 33:55.179
‐I know you mean‐‐ Oh, come on.
‐Ah!

33:55.212 --> 33:56.915
I know you mean well, I do.

33:56.948 --> 34:01.158
But, you know, you are, like,
a big handsome wrecking ball.

34:01.191 --> 34:02.894
I'm not blowing
people's lives up, no.

34:02.927 --> 34:05.066
Okay. All right,
you married one,

34:05.099 --> 34:06.635
and then cheated,

34:06.668 --> 34:08.706
and then nearly married her
again.

34:08.739 --> 34:10.943
The current one,
you couldn't say "I love you,"

34:10.976 --> 34:14.751
but now you're obsessed with
hating the new boyfriend.

34:14.784 --> 34:18.058
Be careful, or you're gonna
blow that up, too.

34:20.896 --> 34:24.804
I'm too messed up already.

34:24.838 --> 34:26.842

Oh, Miguel...

34:47.049 --> 34:49.320
Kate and I just got in
this horrible fight.

34:49.354 --> 34:52.760
She said some really
terrible things to me,

34:52.794 --> 34:54.130
and I lost it.

34:54.164 --> 34:58.038
I mean, I really, really,
really lost my temper.

34:58.071 --> 35:02.713
God, Miguel... I slapped her.

35:02.747 --> 35:07.590
Hey, it's okay. I'm‐I'm here,

35:07.623 --> 35:11.331
Every once in a while
a parent loses it. Okay?

35:11.364 --> 35:14.204
Yeah, I know, but it was just
so hard to go out tonight

35:14.237 --> 35:16.007

35:16.041 --> 35:18.345

And, I don't know, it's just,

35:25.359 --> 35:28.198
it's‐it's unbearable, you know?

35:28.232 --> 35:30.636
It's like I don't know how
to do this.

any of this.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.861
Sorry.

35:59.894 --> 36:02.300
I ran into Malik on his way out.

36:02.333 --> 36:03.669
Oh, yeah?

36:03.702 --> 36:07.210
Yeah. I talked to him.
Didn't go great.

36:07.243 --> 36:10.082
What did you say?

36:10.115 --> 36:13.889
I said that he should
think about Deja here,

36:13.922 --> 36:16.661
and that he should
take a step back.

36:16.695 --> 36:17.897
(laughs) Oh, babe.

36:17.930 --> 36:20.402
