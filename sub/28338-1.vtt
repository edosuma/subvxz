For corn's sake,
Star Butterfly,

01:38.120 --> 01:41.620
this is the third time
you've ruined my prison tower!

01:41.620 --> 01:45.540
Couldn't you have used
one of the holes
you already made?

01:45.540 --> 01:46.830
Uh, sorry.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.330
We just wanted
to triple check

01:48.330 --> 01:49.500
to make sure we hadn't
missed anything.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.880
I believe
I told you before--

01:50.880 --> 01:51.880
let me say it again--

01:51.880 --> 01:53.830
Queen Moon's not here!

01:53.830 --> 01:56.170
You know, this is all
your mom's fault anyway.

01:56.170 --> 01:59.380
Keeping secrets and conspiring
with evil queens.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.500
I know things
are a little shaky right now,

02:01.500 --> 02:03.000
but it's not my mom's fault.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.960
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.420
It's your fault.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.790
Ugh!

02:07.790 --> 02:09.830
Yes, the moment
you're in charge,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.960
you just hand
the whole kingdom over

02:11.960 --> 02:13.500
to the Queen of Darkness

02:13.500 --> 02:15.830
and her frozen
Monster husband.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.330
How's that feeling?
Too tight?

02:17.330 --> 02:19.250
Oh, no, you--
you could go tighter.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.120
Now with Queen Eclipsa
in charge,

02:21.120 --> 02:23.710
I'm no longer allowed
to imprison Monsters.

02:23.710 --> 02:27.170
Now I've had to resort
to imprisoning Mewmans,

02:27.170 --> 02:31.540
and, well,
you know, I'm just not
as passionate about that.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.790
How about just
not imprisoning anybody?

02:33.790 --> 02:35.750
How about you let me
keep doing my job,

02:35.750 --> 02:38.250
and I'll let you
keep ruining everything
for everybody?

02:38.250 --> 02:39.880
Fine!

you checked twice already?

03:21.790 --> 03:24.120
Uh, no! What do you know
about towers?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.790
You live underground.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.380
There are towers
in the Underworld, you know?

You're right, Tom.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.710
You're not stupid.

You never
said I was stupid.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.790
We've looked at this
a million times.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.670
Maybe we've been looking
at it all wrong.

03:52.670 --> 03:54.120

to make sure

03:54.120 --> 03:56.000

what a tower is, right?

Yeah, I know you know
what a tower is.

So you'll be home
at some point, right?

03:59.880 --> 04:01.960

wants to re-check
a few more places,

out of options.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.250
Why would your mom
be at a Pie Carnival?

04:35.250 --> 04:36.830
She's probably confused.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.500
The time she spent
in the Realm of Magic

04:38.500 --> 04:40.380
really did a number
on her memory.

Are you Star Butterfly?!

But they gotta deal
with us now, you know?

04:56.670 --> 04:59.710
Ever since you gave
the kingdom back to Eclipsa,

04:59.710 --> 05:01.670
you've given
us Monsters a chance

05:01.670 --> 05:03.580
to live
a normal life again!

05:03.580 --> 05:05.500

the right thing to do.

The sleaziest scammers
in all of Mewni.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.920
What may seem like
a fun carnyaval is but a trap

05:50.920 --> 05:52.420
to take everything you have.

Your horse, your carriage,
your wedding ring.

want about the pie folk.

for weeks,

had a proper meal.

not to eat the pies!

Including 13 different
types of Moon Dolls!

08:25.920 --> 08:29.500
Our newest addition
is the Supportive
Mom Moon Doll!

08:29.500 --> 08:32.080
[Queen Moon] You're doing
just fine, sweetheart!

08:32.080 --> 08:34.000
No! We don't want
your dumb merchandise!

08:34.000 --> 08:36.750
Maybe just one or two.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.250
I thought you said
you hated the pie folk.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.580
Yes. But do I hate
the pie folk

08:41.580 --> 08:43.880
more than I love my wife?

08:43.880 --> 08:45.750
[frustrated] Ugh!

08:47.460 --> 08:49.500
She's everywhere.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.420
[conversing indistinctly]

08:51.420 --> 08:52.710
[Star] Just look around.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.750
They all love my mom.

08:54.750 --> 08:59.000
Sounds like you need
a Supportive Mom Moon Doll.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.710
I thought giving
the kingdom back to Eclipsa
was the right thing to do.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.920
But I don't know.
Did I-- Did I blow it?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.880
You were Queen,
and you made a decision.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.420
Some people might just need
some time to get used to it.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.920
-[fanfare playing]
-[Fake Manfred]
Fellow Mewmans!

09:13.920 --> 09:16.080
Let us tell you a tale...

09:16.080 --> 09:19.290
one that
we all know too well.

09:19.290 --> 09:21.710
Maybe this will take
my mind off of things.

09:21.710 --> 09:25.330
[Fake Manfred]
The Butterfly Follies.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.790
Ho ho ho,
being king of Mewni

09:28.790 --> 09:31.750
is the easiest job
I've ever married into!

09:31.750 --> 09:33.290
[laughter]

09:34.620 --> 09:37.210
Who... Who is this idiot?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.750
[burp]

09:38.750 --> 09:40.960
All hail your king!

09:40.960 --> 09:42.880
[laughter and boos]

09:42.880 --> 09:44.290
[man]
He's the king!

09:44.290 --> 09:45.880
Oh, no! It's me!

09:45.880 --> 09:47.620
I'm the idiot?!

09:47.620 --> 09:50.210
I'm all out of fooood!

09:50.210 --> 09:51.580
What do I do?!

09:51.580 --> 09:53.580
[crowd]
There's a pie on your head!

09:53.580 --> 09:56.880
Oooh! There's
a pie on my head?

09:58.670 --> 10:00.540
[laughter]

10:00.540 --> 10:02.710
I can't! I can't!

10:02.710 --> 10:04.540
He's so dumb!

10:04.540 --> 10:07.620
He's just like
the real King River!

10:07.620 --> 10:08.750
-Ohh!
-[thud]

10:08.750 --> 10:10.620
This is an outrage.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.540
Let's get out of here.
We don't have to watch this.

10:13.540 --> 10:17.080
[Fake Star] Papa!
Save some pie for me!

10:17.080 --> 10:18.830
Star Butterfly!

10:18.830 --> 10:21.750
-[audience boos]
-Oh, no.

10:21.750 --> 10:25.670
I'm here to destroy
the great Butterfly legacy

10:25.670 --> 10:28.540
with my love of Monsters!

10:28.540 --> 10:31.210
[laughter]

10:31.210 --> 10:36.500
But, dear! What about
your responsibilities
to the Mewmans?

10:36.500 --> 10:39.420
Here's what I got
to say about Mewmans!

10:39.420 --> 10:40.580
Narwhal blast!

10:40.580 --> 10:42.000
[farts]

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
[laughter]

10:45.000 --> 10:47.210
That's not how
the Narwhal Blast works.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.540
Hey.
Let's-- Let's leave.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.380
No. No no no no. No, no.

10:50.380 --> 10:51.380
I wanna see
where they take this.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.920
But I don't!

10:52.920 --> 10:54.540
What do you think
they're gonna do to me?

10:54.540 --> 10:56.250
What's that I hear?

10:56.250 --> 10:59.080
I think my best friend is
about to make an appearance!

10:59.080 --> 11:01.710
It's... Horseface!

11:01.710 --> 11:03.170
[laughter]

11:03.170 --> 11:05.120
My only friend!

11:05.120 --> 11:07.080
Girl,
you know I'm so sassy.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.330
Hee haw!

11:09.330 --> 11:11.540
[Queen Moon] You two always
make such a mess!

11:11.540 --> 11:12.830
[spotlight thuds]

11:12.830 --> 11:14.750
[both] Oh, no!

11:14.750 --> 11:16.540
[Queen Moon]
But do not worry.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.460
[audience gasps]

11:18.460 --> 11:20.120
Your queen is here.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.000
[cheering]

11:24.880 --> 11:27.120
-[fanfare playing]
-[cheering]

11:27.120 --> 11:28.620
We love you, Moon!

11:29.670 --> 11:31.670
The rightful queen
of Mewni!

11:31.670 --> 11:33.880
All hail Queen Moon!

11:34.920 --> 11:36.000
Moonpie!

11:36.000 --> 11:37.250
Is that really her?

11:37.250 --> 11:38.290
It has to be.

11:38.290 --> 11:39.790
Oh, Star,
what are you doing?!

11:39.790 --> 11:41.290
Mama! Mama!

11:41.290 --> 11:43.120
It's me, Star!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.790
[music stops]

11:44.790 --> 11:46.920
[straining]
You're here!

11:46.920 --> 11:48.250
Mmm!

11:48.250 --> 11:50.000
Um, excuse me?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.420
You don't remember me,

11:51.420 --> 11:53.420
but this hug
feels good right now.

11:53.420 --> 11:54.750
Who is that?

11:54.750 --> 11:56.250
What's going on?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.250
Who... Who are you?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.620
Mom, you were
in a magical dimension.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.290
You lost your memory.

12:02.290 --> 12:03.960
There was a unicorn?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.960
Um...

12:05.960 --> 12:07.670
I know it doesn't
make any sense,

12:07.670 --> 12:09.000
but you're my mom.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.960
Indeed!

12:10.960 --> 12:14.620
Queen Moon is
like a mom to us all!

12:14.620 --> 12:16.620
No, she is actually
my mother!

12:16.620 --> 12:19.250
I am
the real Star Butterfly!

12:19.250 --> 12:21.710
Well, I've got the wand!

12:21.710 --> 12:24.000
But I don't know
how to use it!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.420
[laughter]

12:25.420 --> 12:26.830
-Aah!
-[crowd gasps]

12:26.830 --> 12:28.420
I don't need a wand.

12:28.420 --> 12:31.380
It's the real
Star Butterfly.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.920
-Get her!
-[shouting]

12:33.920 --> 12:35.120
I'm sorry. [gasps]

12:35.120 --> 12:36.710
But I need
to queen-nap you.

12:36.710 --> 12:38.080
Aah!

12:38.080 --> 12:40.290
You make
terrible pies!

12:40.290 --> 12:41.670
You tell them, sweetie!

12:41.670 --> 12:43.170
We gotta go.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.120
[crowd shouting]

12:45.120 --> 12:46.500
Warnicorn stampede!

12:46.500 --> 12:48.620
-[neighing]
-Hyah!

12:48.620 --> 12:51.670
[King River] We'd love to stay,
but we don't want to!

12:51.670 --> 12:53.250
[shouting]

12:55.000 --> 12:56.210
Mom!

12:56.210 --> 12:58.170
Moonpie! Mmm!

12:58.170 --> 13:01.000
-Mmm!
-Mmm!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.040
You've come back to me.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.330
I was so scared
I would forget your face,

13:06.330 --> 13:11.250
but you're as beautiful
as I remembered...

13:11.250 --> 13:13.710
Uh... [mutters]

13:13.710 --> 13:17.120
Um, I have
to tell you something.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.710
[King River and Star gasp]

13:19.710 --> 13:22.580
You... cut your hair?

13:22.580 --> 13:25.540
No. I'm not--
[clears throat]

13:25.540 --> 13:28.120
[man's voice] I'm not
the real Queen Moon.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.750
My name is Erik.
[nervous chuckle]

13:29.750 --> 13:31.170
Sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.

13:31.170 --> 13:33.540
I was trying
not to break character.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.670
We were so close!
[crying]

13:35.670 --> 13:39.170
Oh, my gosh.
You have a gift!

13:39.170 --> 13:42.250
This is the most flawless
contouring I've ever seen!

13:42.250 --> 13:45.250
I used my new luminizer
to highlight my cheekbones.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.540
Sometimes Turdina likes
to highlight with glitter.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.880
[Erik] I like to use
glitter on my eyelids
to make 'em pop!

13:49.880 --> 13:51.250
[Marco] Sometimes I'll put
a little bronzer on

13:51.250 --> 13:52.710
and then blend it with my--

13:52.710 --> 13:54.380
Marco! We don't have
time for this!

13:54.380 --> 13:56.210
Oh, my gosh,
can I just say

13:56.210 --> 13:59.250
its an honor to meet
the real Star Butterfly?

13:59.250 --> 14:02.790
What does it feel like
knowing you single-handedly
ruined your kingdom?

14:02.790 --> 14:04.460
Look, she's been
through a lot,

14:04.460 --> 14:06.170
and she really doesn't
need this from you.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.170
Argh!

14:07.170 --> 14:08.710
[ribbits]

14:08.710 --> 14:09.960
Star!

14:09.960 --> 14:11.000
What?!
I'm gonna change him back.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.040
-[ribbits]
-Wait!

14:12.040 --> 14:13.580
[ribbits]

14:13.580 --> 14:14.750
[calling]

14:16.420 --> 14:19.500
[sighs] Great,
one more thing I messed up.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.120
Erik.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.830
I guess the only thing
left to do

14:22.830 --> 14:25.920
is retrace our steps
and start searching
all over again.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.750
Or... we could go home.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.710
Oh, you mean give up?

14:29.710 --> 14:33.040
It's just that
we've been out
here for a while.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.790
We'll be more efficient
if we're well-rested!

14:35.790 --> 14:37.290
[growls]

14:37.290 --> 14:39.580
Hey. I promise
we're not quitting.

14:39.580 --> 14:42.670
Just washing days
of funk off our bodies.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.710
Or in River's case,

14:44.710 --> 14:45.790
-weeks of funk.
-[buzzing]

14:45.790 --> 14:47.290
[chuckling]

14:47.290 --> 14:49.120
Let's go home.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.580
[clanking]

14:52.580 --> 14:54.790
Come on, Dad. Not again!

14:54.790 --> 14:56.790
I have no home
without my Moonpie!

14:56.790 --> 14:59.460
I'm sleeping outside tonight!

14:59.460 --> 15:00.960
Just leave him.
It's not our fault

15:00.960 --> 15:02.380
if he wants to be
a drama king.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.920
Ugh, fine.
I guess you're right.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.380
[Star]
Hey, Eclipsa!

15:16.380 --> 15:19.250
Oh! Star, Marco!
Welcome back!

15:19.250 --> 15:22.000
Any luck finding your mother?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.670
[sighs] No.

15:24.670 --> 15:27.330
You know, have you checked
the tower down the way?

15:27.330 --> 15:28.540
I've checked the tower.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.290
[whispering]
Three times.

15:30.290 --> 15:33.540
Well, you never can
be too thorough.

15:33.540 --> 15:34.750
You wanna bet?

15:34.750 --> 15:35.920
What?

15:37.460 --> 15:38.960
The Castle's really
coming along.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.000
It's a work in progress.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.210
Luckily, I've had
lots of help from
my transition team.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.830
I'd be lost
without them.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.330
Fresh lemonade,
milady?

15:47.330 --> 15:49.330
Thank you, Archibald

15:49.330 --> 15:51.120
[puppies barking,
lasers blasting]

15:51.120 --> 15:52.250
Aah, puppies!

15:52.250 --> 15:54.750
Aw, did you miss us?

15:54.750 --> 15:57.420
Let's head inside.
You must be tired.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.500
Actually, I could
really go for some food.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.960
[puppies barking]

16:02.710 --> 16:04.460
[guards]
Left. Left.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.120
-Left, right, left.
-[Eclipsa] Where's your father?

16:06.120 --> 16:07.960
Still camping off-site?

16:07.960 --> 16:09.380
You know my dad.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.620
He's processing things
slowly.

16:12.620 --> 16:15.500
Princess Star!
I mean, Regular Star!

16:15.500 --> 16:17.540
How goes the search
for your mother?

16:17.540 --> 16:18.960
It's going!

16:18.960 --> 16:21.620
Just taking
some time to recharge.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.080
Did you check that tower?

16:23.080 --> 16:26.000
So, Lavabo,
how are things going here?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.500
I am busy performing
my royal duties as always.

16:29.500 --> 16:33.460
Mmm. Fresh linen smell.

16:33.460 --> 16:38.710
I am still getting used
to seeing the fruits
of my labor defiled.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.040
[panting]
Oh, Star!

16:41.040 --> 16:42.620
Did you find
your mother?

16:42.620 --> 16:47.920
Things have been a bit, uh,
different in her absence.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.250
Star, might I borrow you
for a second?

16:50.250 --> 16:54.330
Wow. This is
quite a production.

16:54.330 --> 16:58.040
[Eclipsa]
I've spared no expense
to free my poor husband.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.500
Ohh, not again!

17:00.500 --> 17:03.120
That is... not working.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.170
No, it's not.

17:05.170 --> 17:09.710
But I just can't help
but try everything I can
to bring him back.

17:09.710 --> 17:12.000
You know what that's like.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.040
Yeah, I do.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.670
Let's get you settled in.

17:16.670 --> 17:19.500
I'm afraid your rooms
aren't quite ready yet.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.830
Things have been
a bit hectic around here.

17:21.830 --> 17:23.750
Ha ha ha!
Don't worry about it.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.330
I'm just happy to sleep
in a real bed for once.

17:26.330 --> 17:27.620
Gah!

17:27.620 --> 17:28.750
Huh?!

17:28.750 --> 17:29.920
[Star] Whoa!

17:32.750 --> 17:33.750
[screech]

17:33.750 --> 17:34.880
Yeeeh!

17:34.880 --> 17:37.250
There's my baby!
Come to Mama!

17:37.250 --> 17:38.750
-[grunting]
-Oof!

17:38.750 --> 17:40.210
-[baby talk]
-[cooing]

17:40.210 --> 17:42.460
Aw, baby Meteora!

17:42.460 --> 17:43.540
Long time no see.

17:46.580 --> 17:50.420
Uh... are you sure
she doesn't remember
anything from before?

17:50.420 --> 17:51.750
Of course not!

17:51.750 --> 17:53.380
At least I hope not.

17:53.380 --> 17:54.750
That'd be bad
for all of us, wouldn't it?

17:54.750 --> 17:56.040
[magic whooshing sound]

17:56.040 --> 17:57.500
Oh! Would you look at that.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.250
My old spying spell!

17:59.250 --> 18:01.210
Back to work already, Star?

18:01.210 --> 18:04.920
Yep. May as well start
quadruple-checking
all the places.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.960
That's...
very thorough of you.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.580
But don't work
yourself too hard.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.460
You need some time to rest.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.210
Ugh! This is pointless!

18:15.920 --> 18:17.460
Star, wait!

18:17.460 --> 18:20.580
Okay, she's somewhere,
but where is where?

18:20.580 --> 18:23.460
Ugh, I don't know
what to do!

18:23.460 --> 18:25.000
[shaking sound]

18:26.170 --> 18:28.540
[scraping noise]

18:32.670 --> 18:34.330
Okay, Glossaryck,
here's what's goin' down.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.960
I need your help,
but I don't have time

18:35.960 --> 18:37.380
for any
of your weird riddles.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.790
I am going
to ask you a question,

18:38.790 --> 18:40.750
and you are going
to answer it, okay?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.330
Okay.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.500
I think the reason
I can't find my mom

18:44.500 --> 18:46.000
is because something
happened to her

18:46.000 --> 18:47.750
when we went
to the magic dimension.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.460
But I can
hardly remember what
even happened there.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.540
What did the magic
do to my mom?

18:52.540 --> 18:54.500
You're asking
the wrong question.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.080
The real question is,

18:56.080 --> 18:58.380
what were you doing
in the magic dimension at all?

18:58.380 --> 19:00.040
That was your first mistake.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.380
What are you talking about?

19:01.380 --> 19:03.500
I had to go there
to find my mom!

19:03.500 --> 19:06.120
Just like I had to go
there to defeat Toffee!

19:06.120 --> 19:08.540
Maybe that
was a mistake, too.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.710
Huh?

19:09.710 --> 19:12.380
[baby cooing]

19:12.380 --> 19:14.000
[raspberries]

19:14.000 --> 19:15.880
I'm worried about Star.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.380
If she can't even find Moon
with the All-Seeing Eye,

19:18.380 --> 19:21.210
well, it's not a good sign.

19:21.210 --> 19:23.620
But she was
in a dimension
of pure magic!

19:23.620 --> 19:26.880
I mean, maybe there's
some kind of interference
or something?

19:26.880 --> 19:29.460
That doesn't really change
how my spell works, Marco.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.710
I'm afraid someone
will have to have

19:31.710 --> 19:33.710
a very difficult conversation
with Star.

19:33.710 --> 19:35.210
[sighs] I know.

19:35.210 --> 19:36.920
There's just never
a good time.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.710
Now might be a good time.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.710
[knock on door]

19:42.710 --> 19:44.040
[Marco] Hey.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.040
Could we, uh, chat?

19:47.040 --> 19:49.170
Yeah, sure, what's up?

19:50.420 --> 19:53.620
So... how is you?

19:53.620 --> 19:58.080
I mean-- I mean,
how is you are doing?

19:58.080 --> 19:59.750
Ugh, you are so bad
at small talk.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.040
Just get to it.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.380
Okay. Okay.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.540
It's just, we've
searched everywhere in
the kingdom for your mom,

20:05.540 --> 20:08.210
but we never seem to get
any closer to finding her.

20:08.210 --> 20:12.380
Have you ever worried
that maybe there's
a tiny chance that...

20:12.380 --> 20:14.290
we might never find her?

20:14.290 --> 20:16.960
Nope. We'll find her.
I know it.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.170
But how can you
possibly know that?

20:19.170 --> 20:21.380
Because I have this.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.960
A picture of us
that says "Beach Day!"?

20:23.960 --> 20:26.040
Look closely, Marco.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.880
When exactly did we
go to that beach?

20:28.880 --> 20:31.080
What is this?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.210
It's a gift
from Father Time.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.830
It's from the future.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.290
What?!

20:35.290 --> 20:37.460
Father Time gave it to me,
and I keep it with me

20:37.460 --> 20:38.790
because sometimes
I need a reminder--

20:38.790 --> 20:40.710
Oh, my gosh,
this was on our fridge!

20:40.710 --> 20:42.540
How long have you
had this thing?!

20:42.540 --> 20:45.210
That's, like,
so many levels
of time paradox!

20:45.210 --> 20:47.040
Just listen, okay?!

20:47.040 --> 20:49.120
I don't know how,
but someday soon,

20:49.120 --> 20:51.620
we're gonna have
this awesome beach day,

20:51.620 --> 20:54.040
and there's no way
I'd be this happy

20:54.040 --> 20:56.120
if we never found my mom.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.500
Huh. Well...

20:59.500 --> 21:01.460
I'm not keen
on paradoxes,

21:01.460 --> 21:03.920
but you do look
pretty happy in that photo.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.330
Still a paradox, though.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.710
Let's get some rest.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.420
The sooner
we find your mom,

21:09.420 --> 21:12.420
the sooner we get
to go to the beach.

21:12.420 --> 21:14.250
Ahh!

21:15.290 --> 21:16.580
[Marco] Good night.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.540
Night night, Marco.

21:20.830 --> 21:22.290
Good night, future Star.

21:24.420 --> 21:27.580
[paper crinkling]

21:28.830 --> 21:31.380
[gasps] You bought
one of their pies?!

21:31.380 --> 21:33.040
-Aah!
-Star!

21:33.040 --> 21:35.120
I'm tired of corn, okay?
Don't judge me.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.960
Those pies are garbage,
so, yes, I will judge you.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.750
Mm! Mm!

21:39.750 --> 21:40.920
Star, you should try this.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.500
It's actually pretty good!

21:42.500 --> 21:44.920
Yeah, who am I kidding?
I'm not above garbage.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.420
[gasps] Marco!

21:46.420 --> 21:48.000
Huh!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.420
Over, under,
around, and through!

21:49.420 --> 21:51.380
Grab the little Mewni rabbit,
pull him through!

21:51.380 --> 21:53.250
What are you doing?

21:53.250 --> 21:54.460
The crust!

21:54.460 --> 21:56.210
It's just how
my mom makes it!

21:56.210 --> 21:58.620
She made them all the time
when I was a little girl.

21:58.620 --> 22:00.250
So do you think... ?

22:00.250 --> 22:01.250
Yes.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.670
My mom made these pies.
