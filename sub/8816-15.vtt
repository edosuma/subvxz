Yes, because all the heaven
I've ever needed

18:41.118 --> 18:43.255
was being with Francine
and my kids.

18:43.374 --> 18:46.408
Oh, wow, Stan.
I had no idea...

18:46.527 --> 18:48.824
that you were such a bitch!

18:48.973 --> 18:50.794
Fine, you got a deal.

18:52.016 --> 18:53.949
Oh, and when you get back
to Earth,

18:54.015 --> 18:56.082
tell Rachael Ray
to (bleep) off.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.770
She'll know what she did.

18:57.852 --> 19:00.324
That is not how you treat
another person!

19:00.427 --> 19:02.531
(smacks)
(flames whoosh)

19:03.608 --> 19:07.009
I can't believe they're dead!
(gasping)

19:07.115 --> 19:09.548
Now, I'm just as broken up
about this as you are,

19:09.640 --> 19:12.311
but we can't ignore the facts...
It's pretty chilly out,

19:12.347 --> 19:14.469
and neither of us knows
how to work the thermostat.

19:14.505 --> 19:16.670
Our only option
is to slice open the bodies

19:16.706 --> 19:18.479
so we can huddle inside them
for warmth.

19:18.613 --> 19:20.917
(inhales deeply)
Let's do it.

19:21.163 --> 19:23.284
I refuse to sleep in socks.

19:23.365 --> 19:25.008
(both gasp loudly)

19:25.266 --> 19:27.066
Stan, we're alive!

19:27.146 --> 19:28.315
Oh, thank God!

19:28.385 --> 19:30.054
What... happened?

19:30.110 --> 19:33.605
I guess someone realized
we needed more time here together.

19:33.641 --> 19:34.702
And this time around,

19:34.738 --> 19:37.291
I'm gonna make it last
as long as possible.

19:37.808 --> 19:39.643
(lowered voice) 'Cause then
I'm going to hell.

19:40.486 --> 19:41.914
What's with the knife?

19:42.043 --> 19:44.117
You shouldn't have to be
a goddamn electrician

19:44.179 --> 19:45.585
to live in this house!

19:45.808 --> 19:47.373
(door creaks open)

19:47.989 --> 19:50.560
Oh, is it cookie time already?

19:50.677 --> 19:53.428
Circle up, boys.
We have a game to play.

19:53.517 --> 19:55.852
No, Steve, you're late
for graduation!

19:56.034 --> 19:57.313
From pledging?

19:57.404 --> 19:59.346
No, from ASU!

19:59.481 --> 20:01.428
Come on, it's about to start!

20:01.603 --> 20:03.936
How?! I was only here
for a week.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.527
Remember when you asked
a question in the science lab?

20:06.608 --> 20:09.442
That was the minimum requirement
to graduate!

20:09.532 --> 20:10.661
Now hurry up!

20:10.705 --> 20:14.068
Oh, and get a speech ready.
You're also valedictorian!

20:14.230 --> 20:15.696

20:15.984 --> 20:17.819

20:44.612 --> 20:46.633
Stan, ready for a jog?

20:46.681 --> 20:47.947
STAN:
Yep! Just one minute.

20:48.048 --> 20:49.359
Stan, I love that

20:49.470 --> 20:51.316
you're beasting it
on the salmon ladder,

20:51.424 --> 20:53.672
but there's no shame
in starting basic.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.546
I know. I just think this will
be very beneficial long-term.

20:56.627 --> 20:57.893
(groans)

20:58.107 --> 20:59.784
I need to live forever.

That's the spirit! (flames whoosh)
