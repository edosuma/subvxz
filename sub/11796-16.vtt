( elevator dings )

01:20.480 --> 01:23.316
Wow, look at this line.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.152
Man, we'll never get tickets
to the U2 concert.

01:26.186 --> 01:29.756
- O ye of little faith.
- We told you we had a plan.

01:29.789 --> 01:33.159
- Have I ever let
you down before?
- Both: Yeah.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.362
When?

01:35.395 --> 01:38.565
The time you snuck us into
the drive-in movie in
the trunk of your car.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.234
So I forgot the trunk key.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.936
You still got to
hear the movie.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.238
Yeah, but it was
a Japanese movie.

01:45.271 --> 01:49.809
Hey,
I tried to read the subtitles
as fast as I could.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.479
No, girls, he really has
a good idea this time.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.414
And there it is now.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.555
Hey, how did Screech get
to the head of the line?

02:02.589 --> 02:04.524
He slept here all night.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.760
- How'd you get
him to do that?
- Simple.

02:06.793 --> 02:10.229
- We bribed him
with a new teddy bear.
- ( alarm clock rings )

02:10.263 --> 02:13.233
Just five more minutes, Mom.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.635
Hey, Screech, get up.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.238
Five tickets
to the U2 concert, please.

02:18.271 --> 02:20.774
The window's not open yet.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.310
Screech, this is the nicest,
sweetest thing
you've ever done.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.179
Even nicer than the time
I wrote ''I love you''

02:26.212 --> 02:28.915
in chocolate syrup
on your mother's white couch?

02:29.716 --> 02:31.785
Forget the whole thing.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.888
Let's check out that
video store while Screech
gets the tickets.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.323
Sure. Screech, you do
have all our money?

02:37.357 --> 02:40.827
Yep,
right here in my slippers.

02:40.860 --> 02:44.297
Since you guys got the tickets
covered, we're going shopping.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.635
Yes, let's go slip our toes
into the new shoes at
the Hot Feet Boutique.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.370
Ooh-la-la. All right.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.906
Let's say we meet in an hour
at the directory sign.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.974
- See ya.
- Bye, Screech.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.510
U2 tickets are now on sale.
Cash only.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.846
I'd like five seats
as close as you've got.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.349
When I say close,
I want to see nose hairs.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.355
I have tickets in mezzanine
or orchestra. What'll it be?

03:08.388 --> 03:11.057
Oh my goodness.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.794
Oh my gosh. Zack will kill me
if I make the wrong decision.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.631
These people will kill you
if you don't hurry up.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.601
Excuse me, fellow U2 fan,
would you hold
my spot in line?

03:21.634 --> 03:23.870
I need to consult
with my friends.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.905
Thanks.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.778
Slater, why can't we meet
girls like that?

03:31.811 --> 03:35.315
Yeah, great figure,
doesn't talk back.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.884
Hi, guys. Who's the cute babe
in the window?

03:37.917 --> 03:39.619
She's a dummy, dummy.

03:39.652 --> 03:42.355
- Screech,
you got the tickets?
- Not exactly.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.791
- You want
mezzanine or orchestra?
- Wait a minute.

03:44.824 --> 03:46.760
You left the line
to ask us that!?

03:46.793 --> 03:49.295
Dimwit!
You lost your place in line.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.964
No problem.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.367
The guy behind me
is saving my spot.
Here he comes now.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.303
Thanks, sir,
for saving my spot in line.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.507
<i>No comprendo, senor.</i>
<i>Adios.</i>

04:02.042 --> 04:06.379
Wait, if he's here,
then who's there? Oops!

04:07.480 --> 04:09.783
I'll save you the trouble.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.619
Get back in line, lunkhead.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.422
If we miss out
on this concert,
I'm gonna kill you.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.628
Hey, Kelly.
Where's Lisa?

04:21.661 --> 04:24.064
She's at the shoe store
flirting with the salesman.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.467
He's taking Polaroids
of her feet.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.836
- Hey, did you buy anything?
- No, I'm broke.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.905
I gave you guys
all the money for the concert.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.074
Where's Screech?
Shouldn't he have
the tickets by now?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.542
( stammering )

04:35.575 --> 04:38.378
Well, you see...
Hey, let's go eat!

04:38.411 --> 04:41.915
- What happened, guys?
- He was born,
need I say more?

04:41.948 --> 04:46.086
Look, I'm sorry, Kelly.
He accidentally stepped out
of line and lost his place.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.954
- You'd better call a priest.
- Why?

04:47.987 --> 04:51.358
Because Lisa's gonna kill him,
and I'm going to
have bad thoughts.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.959
- Lisa: Hi, guys.
- Hey, Lisa.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.462
How are things going
with the shoe salesman?

04:55.495 --> 05:00.100
Oh, they're lookin' good.
Eddie wants to give me a ride
in his Air Jordans.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.802
How many pairs of shoes
did you buy, Lisa?

05:02.836 --> 05:05.372
Just three.
I'm on a tight budget.

05:07.107 --> 05:10.043
- Hey, whose bag is this?
- All: Not mine.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.046
( gasps )
Whoa, Mama!!!

05:13.079 --> 05:16.516
All: Whoa, Mama!

05:16.549 --> 05:19.786
- Is that real money?
- Smells like it.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.922
Sounds like $5,000,
give or take a 20.

05:22.956 --> 05:26.393
Yes, this is going to be
a good day after all.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.961
Wait. This isn't our money.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.563
Some poor person lost it
and we have to return it.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.933
Get real, Kelly.
What ''poor''
person has $5,000?

05:33.967 --> 05:37.504
If they weren't poor before,
they're poor now.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.806
We can't keep this.
It's somebody else's money.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.741
All right, let's be fair.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.377
If it is
someone's money, we should
give them time to reclaim it.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.578
- Agreed?
- ( all agreeing )

05:45.612 --> 05:47.380
Good.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.983
Then I hereby invoke
the ''five-foot,
five-second'' rule.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.518
The what?

05:51.551 --> 05:55.088
If no one is within five feet
of this money when I count
to five, it's ours.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.090
- One, two...
- Cut it out, Zack.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.859
We have to ask around to see
if anybody lost $5,000.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.561
Okay, okay.

06:03.596 --> 06:07.033
( whispering )
Has anyone lost $5,000?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.135
I don't know what you two
are arguing about.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.638
This is my money.
I'm the one who found the bag.

06:11.671 --> 06:14.107
Your money?
You never
would've found the bag

06:14.140 --> 06:17.444
if Zack and I
didn't slide over
so you could sit down.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.146
- Okay,
I'll split it with you.
- Split it with them?

06:20.180 --> 06:23.116
There wouldn't
be a bag to find
if I didn't sit at this bench.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.753
You'd still be
rattling on about
Eddie and his Air Jordans.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.755
( all arguing )

06:28.788 --> 06:30.757
Hold it. Hold it!

06:30.790 --> 06:33.893
I think I've
got a way to solve
this money problem.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.629
How?
Give it all to you?

06:36.663 --> 06:39.065
All right, I'll think
of another way.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.202
We should give it all back,
but not before we put it
to work for us.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.104
What does that mean?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.973
That means, we take the money
and buy as many
tickets as we can.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.642
Then we sell those puppies
for a big profit.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.078
- And the money is returned?
- Absolutely.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.648
We'll think of this
as a short-term loan
with a great interest rate.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.584
- Okay?
- All: All right.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.020
All right, guys, come on.
Let's go find Screech.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.155
- You got the money.
- Yeah, I got the money.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.533
- Bag's gone, Frankie.
- It had to be
those kids, Louie.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.035
Let's go.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.810
Zack:
Whoa, Screech, how did you
move up in line so fast?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.745
Old Disneyland tactic.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.515
I hid under a fern until
I could blend into the line.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.851
- You're goofy.
- No,
but that's who taught me.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.722
We've got a little secret
to tell you but you've got
to keep it quiet.

07:35.755 --> 07:40.694
Did I ever tell Slater
how you filled his locker
with tapioca pudding?

07:40.727 --> 07:44.497
- That was you?
- Uh...
we don't have time for that.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.067
Screech, we want you to buy
a lot of tickets

07:47.067 --> 07:49.636
'cause we just found $5,000.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.205
- Shhh!
- ( loudly ) $5,000?!

07:55.208 --> 07:58.078
Did you have a doughnut
for breakfast, Lisa?

07:58.078 --> 08:01.147
- Your hand tastes good.
- (all groaning )

08:01.181 --> 08:04.184
Look, guys, we still need
to get Screech to
the head of the line.

08:05.585 --> 08:08.555
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.692
Hey, buddy, look at this.

08:12.726 --> 08:16.763
- Mmm, look at that.
- Double-scoop,
we're talking serious.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.269
- Come here, baby.
- ( girls giggle )

08:29.743 --> 08:33.546
- ( both gasp )
- Thank you.

08:36.049 --> 08:40.053
Excuse me, ma'am.
I wonder if you'd
let my friend go ahead of you.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.956
- He missed last
year's concert.
- He was so depressed,

08:43.056 --> 08:46.059
that he locked himself
in the basement for a year.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.294
And today is
his first day out.

08:48.328 --> 08:53.099
No way, blondie.
I never miss a U2 concert!

08:55.235 --> 08:58.605
Would $50 help you
change your mind?

08:58.638 --> 09:00.707
What are you doing?
That's our ticket money.

09:00.740 --> 09:05.011
- You're
forgetting about our find.
- Did he say 50, beautiful?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.281
'Cause I think he meant 100,
little darling.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.551
100 smackers?

09:11.584 --> 09:14.554
Make it two and
I'm outta here.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.025
There you go.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.698
All right, one more customer
and we're rich.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.408
I can't believe
the concert's sold out.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.678
I can't believe
we gave so much
money to that old lady.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.047
And I can't
believe there's a planet
of Elvis impersonators

09:41.081 --> 09:43.350
on a collision
course with Earth.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.252
Can you believe this?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.457
We should turn
the money in right away.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.325
Hey, hey, hey,
let's not be so rash.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.461
There are plenty of ways
to make a quick buck.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.297
We could invest
in the stock market
and double our money.

09:57.330 --> 10:01.101
- And what if we lose?
- Who cares?
It's not our money.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.804
It's not right. I'm telling
that security
officer right now.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.207
Excuse me, Officer,
I'd really...

10:07.240 --> 10:10.043
Low blood sugar.
She has to eat all the time.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.112
What did she say?

10:12.145 --> 10:15.115
She'd like to go
to the restroom, but she
doesn't know where it is.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.384
It's right down there
in the South Promenade.

10:17.417 --> 10:21.154
Thanks for your help, Officer.
And hey, be careful out there.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.258
PA:
<i>Attention, mall shoppers,</i>

10:25.291 --> 10:27.894
<i>due to the phenomenal sales</i>
<i>of U2 concert tickets,</i>

10:27.927 --> 10:30.830
<i>Power Records announces</i>
<i>a second concert</i>
<i>has been added.</i>

10:30.864 --> 10:33.366
<i>Tickets go on sale</i>
<i>tomorrow at 9:00 AM.</i>

10:33.400 --> 10:37.070
Bingo! Who says
opportunity
doesn't knock twice?

10:37.103 --> 10:39.873
This is great!
We have a second chance
to go to the concert.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.909
Better yet, another chance
to make a killing
selling tickets.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.978
Oh no, I'm not sleeping
here again.

10:45.011 --> 10:48.515
Last night, the security dogs
were nipping at my underwear.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.917
No, Screech,
this time we're all staying

10:50.950 --> 10:52.986
so we're guaranteed
to be first in line.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.155
How are we going to pull
that off, Preppie?

10:55.188 --> 10:58.491
I don't know yet.
But I do know we
have a lot of money

10:58.525 --> 11:00.627
and a lot of hours to kill.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.364
How about a little advance
on tomorrow's profits?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.366
Tickle my palm, honey.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.903
I've got places to go
and shoes to try on.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.539
I guess it'd be all right
to look at some bathing suits.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.140
They are selling them
for half off.

11:14.174 --> 11:18.144
Which half
are you going to buy?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.915
You know,
I've always defended you,
but you really are a bozo.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.085
All right, step right up.
Free enterprise. I love it.

11:25.085 --> 11:29.356
Here's $200 for you,
and for you, and you.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.425
- Zack,
some guys are staring at us.
- Zack: Huh?

11:32.459 --> 11:37.530
All right,
all right, no need to draw
attention to ourselves.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.934
We'll split up
now and meet back
at the movies at 6:00.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.403
Hey, you guys,
maybe we should hide the bag.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.271
That's a good point.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.008
Screech, when I put
the money in Lisa's shoebox,

11:48.108 --> 11:50.877
- create a diversion.
- No, I've got a better idea.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.413
I'll create a diversion.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.484
( Screech mimicking monkey )

12:08.628 --> 12:12.198
Oh gosh, now they're holding
hands and feet.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.969
Kelly, don't you have
somewhere to go... quickly?

12:16.069 --> 12:20.073
Come on, Lisa. We're going
to the movies, remember?

12:20.073 --> 12:23.076
Lisa, it's those guys, again.
We've got to get out of here!

12:23.109 --> 12:26.179
Gotta run, Eddie.
We'll do boots tomorrow.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.554
- Move it!
- Ow! Hey, hey, ouch!

12:34.587 --> 12:38.091
- What's going on?
- Those weird guys
were following us.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.493
- We saw them at the boutique.
- They're obviously killers.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.662
We've stolen their money
and now we're going to die.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.498
I'll never get married,
never have
a white picket fence.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.467
I'll never get a letter
from Ed McMahon again.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.703
Kelly, shut up.
They're not killers.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.305
They're just shoppers.
This is a mall, you know.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.341
This money
is making us paranoid.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.177
I'm sure nothing weird will
happen while we're in here.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.080
- Slater: I know. Relax.
- Hi, guys.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.417
- I take that back.
- Why are you
dressed like that?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.587
Because they wanted $300
for the Little
Bo Peep costume.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.056
But why are you wearing
this costume?

13:10.056 --> 13:12.625
That way,
when the bad guys come,
they won't notice me.

13:12.659 --> 13:16.396
The only place you wouldn't
be noticed is in a nuthouse.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.565
Don't be so sure.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.668
- You should have
come shopping with us.
- Check out what I got.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.204
- Bam!
- Psycho!

13:31.544 --> 13:35.148
Female character:
<i>Don't go, Jonathan.</i>
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

13:35.181 --> 13:37.083
Male character:
<i>If you want me to stay, Lydia,</i>

13:37.083 --> 13:40.153
<i>let me hear those three</i>
<i>special words.</i>

13:40.186 --> 13:41.988
( mocking )
Oh, Jonathan.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.191
Not here. Not now.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.727
Oh, Lydia, don't tease me so.

13:47.761 --> 13:50.196
You know how weak I am.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.732
It doesn't matter, Jonathan.

13:52.766 --> 13:56.202
- You're rich.
- Shh!

13:56.236 --> 13:58.371
- What? Girls!
- You gonna move?

14:00.807 --> 14:03.677
( mimics ghosts )

14:03.710 --> 14:06.146
Lisa:
You're so infantile, Slater.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.281
We're trying to
watch the movie.

14:08.314 --> 14:11.051
Female character:
<i>Oh, Jonathan, I love you.</i>

14:11.051 --> 14:13.253
<i>Let's ask the warden</i>
<i>to marry us.</i>

14:13.286 --> 14:17.057
Are you proposing to me,
my precious flower?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.259
Oh yes, darling.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.595
You're the only man
I ever loved.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.330
Lydia.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.466
Jonathan.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.168
Both: Oh!

14:29.736 --> 14:33.239
- Can I be the best man?
- No, but you can
be the dork of honor.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.176
Now will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch the movie!

14:36.209 --> 14:38.211
You can't scare Screechman.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.348
- Oh no? Watch this.
- Ooh, ooh!

14:43.116 --> 14:44.751
It's them!
They're here!

14:44.784 --> 14:46.519
''Just shopping.
It is a mall, you know.''

14:46.553 --> 14:48.755
Right. I hope
they kill you two first.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.091
Okay, everyone stay calm.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.760
We have to get out
without attracting attention.

14:53.793 --> 14:57.130
One at a time, make like
you're leaving
for the bathroom.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.766
Got it? Follow my lead.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.770
( whistling )

15:05.238 --> 15:07.474
( whistles )

15:16.383 --> 15:20.053
Diet soda. Goes through you
faster than a speeding bullet.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.793
Excuse me.

15:26.826 --> 15:31.398
- Hey, guys, where's Screech?
- I don't know.
He was right behind me.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.701
We're being chased by crooks
and you have time
to stop for a yogurt?

15:34.734 --> 15:38.605
Yes. Even Screechman
needs nourishment.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.774
It's almost closing time.
We've got to find
a place to sleep.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.642
We're sleeping here?

15:42.676 --> 15:46.513
Couldn't we find
someplace else,
like The Beverly Hills Hotel?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.415
I guess we could.
But then we wouldn't be

15:48.448 --> 15:50.483
next to the ticket booth
when it opens in the morning.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.419
Morning?
What about our parents?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.821
We'll call our parents
and tell them

15:54.854 --> 15:57.157
everybody is sleeping
at somebody else's house.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.759
And where exactly are we
supposed to be sleeping?

16:00.727 --> 16:03.196
Well... you see that tent?

16:05.832 --> 16:07.267
We're camping out.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.703
When I give you the signal,
go for it.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.848
- Anything I
can help you with?
- Uh... yeah, yeah.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.517
How much is that football
up there?

16:33.693 --> 16:37.163
- $29.95.
- $29.95. Good.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.866
Now, is that hogskin,
boarskin or pigskin?

16:39.899 --> 16:42.469
I don't know.
Nobody's ever asked.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.372
Well, then,
it's a good thing I did.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.513
- It's pigskin.
- Good.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.749
I'm the manager
of a school football team

16:55.782 --> 16:59.419
and I need
footballs for practice.
Do you have any more,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.788
- say, in back?
- I'll check.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.491
You'd better hurry, because
the season starts
in three months.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.410
Sorry, guys,
we're closed.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.612
- But... wait!
- Sorry.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.256
( door closes )

17:36.289 --> 17:39.392
Slater: Can you please move?
Your foot is on my hand.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.295
Zack:
Hey, your hand is on my foot.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.798
- Lisa: It's dark in here.
- Screech:
That's all right, my darling.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.600
I have x-ray vision.
Ow!

17:47.634 --> 17:51.404
Lisa: And get rid
of that stupid costume!

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
Everything is going just fine.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.911
I'll be happy
when this is all over
and we return the $5,000.

17:57.944 --> 18:01.548
There are five of
us and we'd like
the maximum 10 tickets apiece.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.583
Anywhere on the floor
would be fine.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.654
- That'll be $3,000.
- All right.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.859
- It's gone!
- What?!

18:12.892 --> 18:15.695
The money is gone!

18:20.767 --> 18:24.871
- How could it just disappear?
- How could I buy
these ugly shoes?

18:24.904 --> 18:28.041
The boxes must've gotten
switched when you guys ran
out of the shoe store.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.910
Now, let's go find the money.
Let's go!

18:38.818 --> 18:41.955
There are
a thousand boxes in here.
What are we going to do?

18:42.055 --> 18:44.290
Slater,
Screech and I will check
all the shoeboxes out.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.861
You guys start trying some on.
One of us is bound
to find the money.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.065
Excuse me, ma'am.
Store security.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.367
- I have to check that box.
- Why?

18:54.401 --> 18:58.638
Parliamentary procedure.
There's been a bunch of
floor sample thefts.

18:58.672 --> 19:01.007
Thank you.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.610
- Okay, you can go.
- Right this way.

19:08.314 --> 19:12.018
- Lisa, I've missed you.
- Can the jive, Eddie.

19:12.052 --> 19:14.320
We want to try on
every shoe in the store.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.823
Get some help, honey,
'cause we've got work to do.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.061
- Yaa-hooo!
- What, Screech?

19:21.094 --> 19:25.131
- Did you find the money?
- No, but I found
a slide for my turtle.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.044
We have checked
every box in the store.
Where could it be?

19:46.052 --> 19:48.688
- You again?!
- Good morning, ma'am.

19:48.722 --> 19:51.224
- I'll be taking
this if you don't mind.
- Over my dead body.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.060
Look, there's Kevin Costner.

19:54.094 --> 19:56.396
- Where?
- Bingo!

19:56.429 --> 19:58.865
Let's go buy us
some concert tickets.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.267
- There they are, Frankie.
- Hey, kids, c'mere.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.304
- We want to talk to ya.
- Run for it, guys!

20:04.337 --> 20:07.741
Here's some money
for the mess.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.843
- Now what?
- I don't know,
I'm out of ideas.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.912
- Anybody got any suggestions?
- Eat fiber,
you'll live longer.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.881
- Man: Hey, you kids.
- It's security.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.718
- The boutique
must have reported us.
- In there! Rush it!

20:20.220 --> 20:23.289
We should have
turned the money in
right when we found it.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.026
Lisa, why did you have to be
so nosey and
pick up that bag!?

20:26.059 --> 20:29.829
Don't blame this on me.
Zack's the one
with the bright ideas.

20:29.863 --> 20:32.799
- Is my corsage on straight?
- Yes, it looks great.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.339
How can you say
this is my fault?

20:39.372 --> 20:42.475
None of this
would have happened
if Screech had stayed in line.

20:42.509 --> 20:45.879
- Don't blame me.
- He was following
your dumb scheme.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.248
- No, it was Slater's idea.
- Me?!

20:48.281 --> 20:50.984
- See?
- Hold it!

20:54.120 --> 20:56.156
( all shouting )

21:05.231 --> 21:07.434
Hold it!

21:07.467 --> 21:09.469
Stop the fighting.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.071
We've got to figure
a way out of this.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.340
Why can't we just
use the front door?

21:13.373 --> 21:16.076
Screech, don't make me
clobber a priest.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.346
We have to find a way
to return the money. Maybe...

21:19.379 --> 21:22.082
Shh.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.319
Zack!

21:29.856 --> 21:33.226
- Officer,
I'm glad we found you.
- We need your help.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.128
These two mob guys
are chasing us.

21:35.161 --> 21:38.264
- They want this
money we found.
- Or they're going to kill us.

21:38.298 --> 21:42.235
- Is that a jelly doughnut?
- Yes,
which means I'm on break.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.804
- Come back in 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes?!

21:44.838 --> 21:47.307
In 10 minutes, we're gonna
be wearing cement boots,

21:47.340 --> 21:50.944
- sleeping in
the ocean with the fishes.
- All right, break's over.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.380
- Now, what can I do for you?
- ( Kelly screams )

21:53.413 --> 21:56.883
- Save us from those guys!
- Why should l?

21:56.916 --> 22:01.087
- I'm with them.
- I want my mommy!

22:01.121 --> 22:03.490
All right, kids,
hand over the dough.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.492
All right, all right.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.962
- Here you go. See ya.
- You're not going anywhere!

22:09.062 --> 22:11.331
We've got a surprise for you.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.067
We're dead!

22:14.067 --> 22:18.405
No, kids,
you're on <i>Candid Video!</i>

22:18.438 --> 22:21.341
Wave to everyone at home!

22:24.411 --> 22:27.313
The television show?!

22:27.347 --> 22:30.917
You mean you've
been videotaping
this whole thing?

22:30.950 --> 22:34.888
That's right...
the ticket line, the movies,
the boutique... everything.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.556
This is terrible.

22:36.589 --> 22:39.559
I was wearing the same outfit
for two days.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.127
And for being guests
on our show,

22:41.161 --> 22:46.366
<i>Candid Video's</i> giving you
five front-row tickets
to the U2 concert!

22:46.399 --> 22:48.301
Five front-row tickets?

22:48.335 --> 22:51.004
Do you know how much money
we could get for these?

22:51.104 --> 22:52.872
All: No!

22:59.346 --> 23:02.215
( instrumental
theme music plays )
