00:10.510 --> 00:14.431
She has always found
a way to hurt you, Nick.

00:14.514 --> 00:19.644
You wrote her a heartfelt melody,
and she rejected you quick.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.188
-Maybe you were just a joke…

00:22.272 --> 00:25.025
…and Judd was always her pick.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.735
-She humiliated you

00:26.818 --> 00:28.737
-worse than when everyone saw…
-Ahh!

00:28.820 --> 00:31.614
-…your tiny little dick.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.160
-Huh?
-You're having a nightmare about me?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.954
-So pathetic.
-Ew. I'm stuck! What is this?

00:38.038 --> 00:41.082
You're standing in the middle
of the road like an idiot!

00:41.166 --> 00:43.793
-What the fuck? Jessi?

00:43.877 --> 00:47.922
-Glazer…

00:48.006 --> 00:49.799
-Walter?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.634
Walter? What happened to you, man?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.219
Jessi did this to me.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.930
I was a gorgeous butterfly,

00:56.014 --> 00:58.558
and she turned me into this horrid worm!

00:58.641 --> 01:00.477
Yeah, because she's a goddamn nightmare.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.146
You hate her. Don't you, Nick?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.899
I wish she'd get really bad diarrhea
and then vanish.

01:05.982 --> 01:09.611
Zip-zap, she treats you like crap.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.489
We want her to take a permanent dirt nap.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.450
Oh, man, this is gonna be a scary episode.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.243
I hope I don't spill my popcorn.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.495
A-booga-booga-booga, bitch!

01:18.578 --> 01:19.829
My popcorn!

01:54.364 --> 01:57.200
-Cheater, cheater, pussy eater!
-Ew!

01:57.283 --> 01:59.536
Save some snatch for the rest of us!

01:59.619 --> 02:02.163
Dang, Missy, your rumor worked!

02:02.247 --> 02:04.541
The whole school's
going medieval on Ali and Jessi.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.377
If V is for "Vendetta", then M is for

02:07.460 --> 02:11.131
"Motherflippers shouldn't have
stolen my affinity group!"

02:11.214 --> 02:13.049
Die from shame, you heathen scum!

02:13.133 --> 02:14.342
-Ow!

02:15.885 --> 02:18.555
Firefly, what's so funny
on your cellular device?

02:18.638 --> 02:22.475
Oh, uh, nothing much.
Just looking at Instagram.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.434
Lie to 'em, girl!

02:23.518 --> 02:27.355
Ooh! Say it's a new Internet challenge
where people draw eyes on their balls,

02:27.438 --> 02:29.607
then smush their dicks
down between their balls

02:29.691 --> 02:31.734
so their genitals look like Squidward!

02:31.818 --> 02:34.237
-Share some of those giggles, Don Rickles.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.780
Um, it's just a meme

02:35.864 --> 02:38.950
where SpongeBob is wiping the counter
with a tiny version of himself.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.703
Well, that's clever because he's a sponge!

02:41.786 --> 02:44.539
Now, c'mon, girl. Let's refresh
the comments every 30 seconds.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.375
-Give me some.
-Blue Cross Blue Shield just followed me.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.710
Get into it, influencer!

02:48.793 --> 02:51.963
Look, I know you guys thought
Charles Lu was awesome…

02:52.046 --> 02:57.468
He gets that magic is the perfect storm
of art, science and sex.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.347
See, the problem was I wanted him
to swallow me whole like a pelican,

03:01.431 --> 03:02.724
but in the end,

03:02.807 --> 03:07.353
he wanted to wet-shit me out
all over the pier like a common seagull.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.023
That's tragic, Jay. Like my life.

03:10.106 --> 03:15.153
No! It helped me realize
that I have a boner for intimacy,

03:15.236 --> 03:18.698
and the only one who can
jack my heart off is Lola Skumpy.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.408
But how will you win her back?

03:20.491 --> 03:23.328
Money? Jewels? A romantic indie rock song?

03:23.411 --> 03:27.123
Guys, I think it might be time
to perform the ultimate magic trick.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.710
Sawing your finger in half,
then having your cock double in size,

03:30.793 --> 03:32.545
but now your cock has a fingernail?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.964
Todd, that's an amazing trick, but no.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.925
I'm gonna admit that I was wrong.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.261
I wish you
the most sensual of fortunes, Jay.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.346
Thank you, Paul.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.556
And I hope that pawn shop
gives you good money

03:43.640 --> 03:45.475
for your missing daughter's ukulele.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.893
Ah, another goddamn day.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.562
-Hey.
-Jesus, Nick, you don't look so good.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.648
Did you drink too much water before bed

03:51.731 --> 03:54.192
and you stayed up all night
pissing with a big water belly?

03:54.275 --> 03:56.527
-Jessi's such a bitch!
-Whoa! Nick!

03:56.611 --> 03:59.906
What? She knew Ali had a girlfriend
and then she fucking teased me.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.575
-Fucking bitch.
-Oh, Nick, man, that's just a rumor.

04:02.659 --> 04:07.038
It's just a sexy,
girl-on-girl, jailhouse rumor.

04:07.121 --> 04:11.167
No, it's not sexy! Jessi is trash.
And if you don't see that, then fuck off!

04:11.251 --> 04:14.170
What a little asshole.
Let's curb stomp his fat mouth!

04:14.254 --> 04:16.714
No, I'm taking the high road now, okay?

04:16.798 --> 04:20.176
Oh, God, you're still doing
that "Tender Andrew" thing?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.096
I am, and the view up here is pretty nice.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.808
You can look down girls' shirts
and see their sternum!

04:26.891 --> 04:28.309
Ah, yes, the sternum.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.438
The jail of the heart,
but the foundation for them titties.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.357
-Good morning!

04:34.440 --> 04:35.566
Our top story today,

04:35.650 --> 04:38.569
Ms. Benitez got dropped off
at school by her new boyfriend,

04:38.653 --> 04:40.905
and he's got a ponytail.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.617
But first, I had a quick conversation
with the victims of a vicious rumor.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.203
Jessi, Ali, how are you gals holding up?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.454
Well, thank you for asking.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.791
I have to say,
this whole situation sucks and is unfair!

04:51.874 --> 04:53.584
And I didn't cheat on Samira.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.086
Jessi is-is just a friend.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.756
-There is no water in my mug.
-Water is for guests, Caleb.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.052
Now, Jessi, if Dr. PlainTalk were watching
right now from the medical facility

05:03.136 --> 05:05.680
where they practice gossip,
what would you say to them?

05:05.763 --> 05:09.809
I would say I don't know why you're
trying to besmirch our reputations,

05:09.892 --> 05:12.687
but all you're really doing
is making our friendship stronger.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.315
And if I find you, you little fucker,

05:15.398 --> 05:18.192
I'm gonna twist your nipples off,
wear them as earrings,

05:18.276 --> 05:22.655
and everyone's gonna be like,
"Ooh la la, Ali, who are you wearing?"

05:22.739 --> 05:24.699
"Oh, these? Just some little fucker!"

05:24.782 --> 05:27.493
"Little fucker"?
Oh, hell no! You a big fucker.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.495
That's right! I fuck big!

05:29.579 --> 05:31.080
Jessi's so full of shit.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.751
"Oh, I don't like you.
Oh, look at my red hair. Nyuh!"

05:34.834 --> 05:36.878
Yeah, Jessi is full of shit, actually.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.921
Did you hear
the way she said "besmirched"?

05:39.005 --> 05:41.257
It's like, we get it.
Your parents are divorced.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.469
You're filling a void
with vocabulary words. Congrats.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.597
Yeah, that's totally
what's happening there. And it's sad!

05:47.680 --> 05:50.141
Ha-ha! This girl is on fire!

05:50.224 --> 05:52.226
Hey, nice to meet you, I'm Rochelle.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.730
Rochelle, it's me, Walter Las Palmas.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.941
Oh, shit! Walter! You look amazing now!

05:59.025 --> 06:01.235
-How'd you turn into such a bad bitch?
-Do you like?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.237
I've been on this hate diet all week.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.406
I just eat cookies and talk shit.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.200
Before, you were so annoying
being all nice.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.118
-I agree.
-Now you look like wet garbage

06:09.202 --> 06:10.703
'cause you got some hate in your life.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.246
I'mma cry. Thank you so much.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.583
What I tell you?
Let the love go and let the hate overflow.

06:15.666 --> 06:19.712
Wow! It's really sweet
to see Nick and Missy reconnecting.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.506
This is a nice episode.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.384
You have a dead onion
in your skull, you know that?

06:24.467 --> 06:27.970
And you, you at home,
you're laughing at this block of wood?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.722
You're all complicit.

06:29.806 --> 06:34.435
That's right, I'm a bad fucking mitten,
and this is the hate episode.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.438
Now eat this fucking light bulb,
you ass fuck.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.523
Okay!

06:38.606 --> 06:40.400
Oh!

06:40.483 --> 06:42.318
-It's giving me an idea.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.113
I think I'm gonna poop blood later.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.782
All right, does anyone have any questions?

06:47.865 --> 06:49.867
-That aren't about my boyfriend

06:49.951 --> 06:51.285
-with the ponytail.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.914
Excuse me,
I have a delivery for a Lola Skumpy.

06:54.997 --> 06:58.501
Someone sent her
a 40-year-old jacked magician.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.086
Mmm, I'll let this play out.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.003
You know what?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.381
I also would like to see
where this is going.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.425
-Lola Ugfuglio Skumpy.
-What?

07:05.508 --> 07:09.470
I was wrong about everything,
and I owe you an apology.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.513
Listening.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.682
-See, I want to give you my heart.
-Hmm.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.644
The only problem is
it's stuck inside of my guts.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.354
-Todd, if you will.
-Mm-hmm.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.110
-That's actually, like, very sweet.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.655
Ha-ha! I live!

07:27.738 --> 07:29.740
My death may have been fake, Lola,

07:29.824 --> 07:32.368
but the pain of being apart from you is…

07:33.828 --> 07:34.787
very real.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.372
Come back to me, my queen.

07:36.456 --> 07:41.502
I yearn to taste the earth from your feet.
How else will I know where you've been?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.463
But how do I know I can trust you?

07:43.546 --> 07:45.381
For I've been burned before.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.509
Mainly from eating
Totino's Pizza Blasts from the microwave

07:48.593 --> 07:51.095
while they're still, like,
very much in the microwave.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.347
Ooh, your lack
of impulse control is so hot.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.183
Oh my God, we should move in together!

07:55.266 --> 07:57.310
-I was thinking the exact same thing!
-Really?

07:57.393 --> 07:58.561
Uh, yeah!

07:58.644 --> 08:02.148
Ms. Benitez, if you will
kindly unroll your cigarette, please.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.610
-"Lola plus Jay equals house."

08:05.693 --> 08:07.320
Oh, my God, Jay!

08:07.403 --> 08:11.824
-I will totally house with you!
-I can't believe this is happening!

08:11.908 --> 08:14.619
Oh, my God, Jay,
you thought of everything!

08:14.702 --> 08:16.787
And you know what? I know just the place.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.957
Okay, but it has to be two bedrooms
because I need a home office.

08:20.041 --> 08:24.545
My Etsy shop for unlicensed Hamilton merch
is, like, blowing up.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.091
-I don't like this!

08:29.175 --> 08:30.801
Yeah. Everybody's staring at us.

08:30.885 --> 08:35.139
And not in a sexy way, like when you
walk up to Seann William Scott and say,

08:35.223 --> 08:38.935
"Excuse me, did you,
Seann William, drop this?"

08:39.018 --> 08:41.145
And Sean looks down,
and you're holding his dick.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.774
Mmm, no, Connie,
it's not like any of what you just said.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.693
Guys. I heard Ali spread
Jessi's boobs so far,

08:47.777 --> 08:50.112
-her areolas touched in the back. Boop!

08:50.196 --> 08:51.739
Get the fuck out of here, Lars!

08:51.822 --> 08:54.408
When I get my hands
on whoever started this rumor,

08:54.492 --> 08:56.077
it's gonna be titty-twist city!

08:56.160 --> 08:58.120
-I have a tingle in my tummy

08:58.204 --> 09:00.915
telling me
a slimy little fucker is behind this.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.626
-Yeah, I'm starting to feel that same

09:03.709 --> 09:05.586
"slimy little fucker" tingle.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.463
I have a tingle in my tummy too!

09:07.547 --> 09:10.633
I put a remote control vibrator
in my vagina.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.677
I bet you can't guess
who's controlling it.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.803
Seann William Scott?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.304
No, it's Jason Biggs.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.350
I asked him to give it to Seann William,
and he kept it for himself.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.353
I would like to propose
a toast to Dr. PlainTalk.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.605
Whoever that guy is, he is a genius.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.482
Tell him it's you, Missy. Get that glory!

09:26.566 --> 09:31.445
Well, let me bust up your gender norms,
because that guy is a girl!

09:31.529 --> 09:34.782
-What?
-And that girl is Missy, and Missy is me!

09:34.865 --> 09:35.825
I'm confused.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.201
I'm Dr. PlainTalk.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.121
I started the rumor.
I made it up from my brain.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.081
I'm a fucking maniac!

09:42.164 --> 09:44.208
Holy shit. You? Missy?

09:44.292 --> 09:47.336
Ms. Missy if you're nasty. Uh, which I am.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.046
-Yes, honey!
-Come on, Miss Nasty!

09:49.130 --> 09:50.381
Nick and Missy?

09:50.464 --> 09:52.925
Yeah, it's, uh… It's kind of weird, right?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.136
You do know that
according to the bro code,

09:55.219 --> 09:58.014
you'd be well within your rights
to pull his tongue so hard

09:58.097 --> 10:00.474
that his asshole comes out
of his fucking mouth.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.102
And while that may be
a fun visual for everyone,

10:03.185 --> 10:05.229
for all we know,
they're just having a friendly lunch.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.481
Well, I'm still gonna do
that tongue thing to Rick.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.482
What tongue thing?

10:10.568 --> 10:13.946
-Uh-oh, I'm made of SpaghettiOs!

10:14.530 --> 10:18.284
-Hey! Gentle with my castle, you idiot!

10:18.367 --> 10:21.662
And you, put that
Gronk Bobble-Butt on my nightstand.

10:21.746 --> 10:25.416
He's got that Gronk-a-donk
that makes my Lola lumps plump!

10:25.499 --> 10:27.084
What the fuck, Jay?

10:27.168 --> 10:30.713
-You're back? And who's this girl?
-Who's this fucking genie?

10:30.796 --> 10:33.090
I'm not a genie. I'm a ghost!

10:35.092 --> 10:39.430
Well, if you're Duke Ellington,
then I'm Queen Shit, so smell my ass!

10:39.513 --> 10:41.223
Ooh, isn't she the best?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.100
And wait till you peep her feet.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.227
-Hey, man, I get it.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.779
Zip it! None of your boring music,
you dead dud.

10:54.862 --> 10:58.115
Only Anna Kendrick's "Cups"
is allowed in my house!

10:58.199 --> 11:01.077
Sweet Lord, please kill me again.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.081
Attention! Attention, everyone.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.792
In an obvious effort
to steal Lola's thunder,

11:07.875 --> 11:12.004
Devon and I have also decided
to repair our relationship.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.715
Of course Devon went back
to her like a little bitch.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.259
Yeah, those two
are really perfect for each other.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.595
Mazel Tov to Mr. and Mrs. Who Cares!

11:19.679 --> 11:21.263
Sweetie, we care.

11:21.347 --> 11:25.810
You wanted to kiss Devon's pee-pee
with your vee-vee. Or your lippies.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.979
Dude…
…I had one crazy rager with the boys,

11:29.063 --> 11:31.440
and realized I am too old
for the street life, man.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.609
Devon, nobody cares
about your thought process.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.195
Good to be back, babe.
This is the structure I crave.

11:36.278 --> 11:39.323
You know what I crave?
Devon getting diarrhea and vanishing.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.491
Oh, my God. Yes!

11:40.574 --> 11:44.328
And then Devin slips on the diarrhea,
and she's like, "Ooh! Whoa! Whaa!"

11:44.412 --> 11:47.540
And then she breaks her neck. I love that!

11:48.749 --> 11:51.335
Damn! You wicked worm!

11:51.419 --> 11:54.213
Hating with you is,
like, uh, the most fun!

11:54.296 --> 11:55.464
Right back at you, boo!

11:55.548 --> 11:57.842
Missy, I feel like
we're the only ones who get--

11:57.925 --> 12:00.261
Like, how stupid and lame everyone is?

12:00.344 --> 12:01.846
Yes! Exactly!

12:01.929 --> 12:04.014
-Fuck yeah!

13:08.037 --> 13:08.954
Just say, "Fuck it!"

13:10.706 --> 13:11.707
You all can suck it!

13:19.465 --> 13:21.091
Whoa, look at you!

13:21.175 --> 13:22.092
Right?

13:22.176 --> 13:25.137
I feel thick in all the right places.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.932
Your hate nourishes me, Nick!

13:28.015 --> 13:29.225
Holy shit, Missy.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.769
Nick looks so hot
with his Sid Vicious hair.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.896
Let's attach a leash to that spiked collar

13:33.979 --> 13:36.190
and hide a pill for him
in some peanut butter!

13:36.273 --> 13:39.485
No, Mona, we're not being horny,
we're being hateful.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.569
Can't we be both?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.155
Hey, when I want a slut's opinion,
I'll ask for it.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.366
Why don't you go get lost
and play cricket or some shit.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.992
Is that how you feel, Missy?

13:47.076 --> 13:48.035
Slut says what?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.662
Well, fuck you, then!

13:49.745 --> 13:52.665
Bye, ho! We don't need
that walking Daily Mail article.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.750
-We already have the perfect crew.
-Damn right!

13:54.834 --> 13:56.085
I hope she ODs!

13:56.168 --> 13:57.336
And then pulls through,

13:57.419 --> 14:00.756
taking the recovery time
to work on herself. Ahh! Bitch!

14:01.382 --> 14:03.884
Okay. Potential Dr. PlainTalk suspects.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.054
Devin LeSeven,
Rabbi Paulblart's adult son Leore…

14:07.137 --> 14:09.723
Honestly, I think it might have been Nick.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.016
Of course!

14:11.100 --> 14:13.227
He's probably pissed
because you told the whole school

14:13.310 --> 14:15.312
he makes your pussy
want to sew itself shut.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.314
Okay, that is not what I said.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.357
It's what I heard.

14:18.440 --> 14:23.028
If Nick did this,
I will never be able to forgive him.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.739
-I--I will just--
-You'll hate his fucking guts?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.449
Well, that seems a tad harsh.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.577
Maybe, maybe not.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.036
Do you wish ill on Nick?

14:31.120 --> 14:33.038
Do you want him dead like a doornail?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.832
-I don't know!

14:34.915 --> 14:36.709
-Jessi, help!
-Nick?

14:36.792 --> 14:39.336
So you gonna
flatten the little shit or what?

14:39.420 --> 14:43.048
Yeah, you gonna be a bitch
and run me over like a bitch, you bitch?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.301
Dude, what is your problem?

14:45.384 --> 14:46.969
Do you want me to hit you?

14:47.052 --> 14:48.596
Seems like he does.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
-No!

14:52.391 --> 14:57.479
Ugh! Nick is being such a dick right now,
but I guess I don't want him to die.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.065
Huh, so you don't completely hate him.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.317
Yeah, that seems to be…

15:01.400 --> 15:03.235
-What's going on?

15:03.319 --> 15:06.780
-Connie, what's happening?
-Whoo! Jason Biggs just made me cum.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.366
Yeah, I'm--I'm never
gonna get used to saying that.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.411
Alright, just gonna hang out
at Nick's house like normal.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.163
Or you could burn the house down.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.915
Might not even mention how weird it was

15:15.998 --> 15:17.708
that he and Missy
were having lunch together.

15:17.791 --> 15:22.087
Or you could mention it while you're
pissing on his tiny, charred corpse.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.256
No, no, I'm just gonna say hi. Okay?

15:24.340 --> 15:26.717
-I'm just gonna… Whoa, Nick!
-Hey, Andrew. Shut the door.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.386
Darrell, get out of here, man. It's scary!

15:29.470 --> 15:31.305
What the hell are you two doing in here?

15:31.388 --> 15:34.725
-If you're having sex, I hope it's safe!
-No, it's not like that, Andrew.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.852
We're shitting
all over Jessi's bitch face.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.021
Check it out, I photoshopped her mugshot.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.523
Ooh, send me that.
I'll post it on Dr. PlainTalk.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.525
Whoa! You're Dr. PlainTalk?

15:43.609 --> 15:46.153
Oh, the doctor is a woman!

15:46.236 --> 15:49.490
She must be a gynecologist.
This was a good riddle.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.159
Missy, I never figured you for a troll.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.870
I'd get off your high horse
if I were you, Fart Boy.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.331
You're the poster child
for yucky behavior.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.917
Yeah, but nobody wants to touch
the poster because it's covered--

16:00.000 --> 16:02.461
"Covered in my jizz." I know that line.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.838
We're all having fun
at ol' Andrew's expense.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.924
Well, that's what the show is, dumb ass.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.927
Hey, hey! Don't you dare
undercut what we're doing here.

16:10.010 --> 16:14.932
This show is middle-aged people playing
masturbating children with big feelings!

16:15.015 --> 16:16.600
And they get their periods!

16:16.684 --> 16:18.394
Wait, Maury,
have we done a queefing episode?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.479
No, there's no queefing episode.
I keep pitching it.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.438
-It'd be funny.
-Right?

16:21.522 --> 16:25.317
Well, this big, fat masturbator
and his big feelings are hurt right now.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.236
So, what are you gonna do, cry about it?

16:27.319 --> 16:29.029
Oh, are you a crybaby?

16:29.113 --> 16:33.200
You know what, "friends" in quotes?
Being here is bad for my anger sobriety.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.662
Well, good! Don't let the door
hit your lumpy butt on the way out.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.582
Okay! Well, now I know you're just jealous
because I've got cheeks for weeks,

16:40.666 --> 16:43.460
and you both just have flat kid ass.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.798
Hey, babe, Steve's gonna pop by
for a drink before dinner. Is that cool?

16:47.881 --> 16:51.343
Oh, that's great. I'll start heating up
some almond milk on the radiator.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.261
Hey.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.347
What was that for, you stinky stud?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.766
I love you, Lola Ugfuglio Skumpy.

16:57.850 --> 17:02.938
Well, for peak's sake, I love you,
Jayzerian RicFlairian Bilzerian.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.357
Oh, my God. You said it! You love me?

17:05.441 --> 17:06.692
Like, duh!

17:06.775 --> 17:07.609
Whoo!

17:07.693 --> 17:10.529
Jay is loved! Jay is loved!

17:10.612 --> 17:12.364
My dad was wrong.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.576
We're in such, like,
a healthy place right now, Jay.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.662
I agree.
Coming home to a woman who loves me,

17:18.746 --> 17:21.123
stealing dinners from the Birch's kitchen…

17:21.206 --> 17:25.377
This is exactly what I was missing when
I was deep-tonguing down with Charles Lu.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.422
Hold on. Pause.
Play that back one more time!

17:28.505 --> 17:30.924
No, no, it's cool.
It happened after we broke up.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.676
Charles Lu?

17:32.760 --> 17:36.513
In fact, sucking on his mouth snake
is what made me realize

17:36.597 --> 17:38.891
how much I missed your mouth snake.

17:38.974 --> 17:42.269
So what do you say
we pay a visit to the reptile house?

17:43.854 --> 17:45.230
I'll fucking kill you, Jay!

17:45.314 --> 17:48.317
-What's going on upstairs?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.360
Oh, Jay and his girlfriend
moved into the attic.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.278
-What?
-Oh, yeah.

17:51.361 --> 17:55.115
I said it was okay because any girlfriend
of Jay's is a daughter of mine.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.910
-I'll tear your face from your skull!

17:57.993 --> 18:01.080
Jesus, babe, are you mad
because Charles is a guy?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.624
-What is this?
-How dare you insinuate that!

18:03.707 --> 18:06.251
I am nothing if not a future gay icon.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.753
My pubes are even gay!

18:07.836 --> 18:11.715
-Uh, we're just British, Your Majesty.
-We've explained this several times.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.885
I'm upset because
you were supposed to be mourning me,

18:14.968 --> 18:17.930
but instead you were scorning me!

18:18.013 --> 18:21.433
So you're saying you wouldn't have
made out with the hottest guy in school

18:21.517 --> 18:22.684
if it was offered to you?

18:22.768 --> 18:26.230
How dare you speak of
someone else's hotness in front of me!

18:26.313 --> 18:28.023
I'm taking back my "I love you"!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.900
Stop quoting my dad's wedding vows!

18:29.983 --> 18:33.737
I will not, and I want you out
of our humble abode!

18:33.821 --> 18:38.867
Oh, you can't throw me out
because, baby, I'm outta here!

18:38.951 --> 18:41.870
Charles Lu might not have
given me the intimacy I ache for,

18:41.954 --> 18:45.374
but at least he wasn't a fucking psycho!

18:45.457 --> 18:47.835
I am not a psycho!

18:48.418 --> 18:52.589
With my gay pubes as my witness,
I will get my vengeance, Jay!

18:52.673 --> 18:55.425
We're not gay,
Your Majesty, we're just British!

18:55.509 --> 18:56.635
What's the difference?

18:58.303 --> 18:59.388
Hey, fat tits!

18:59.471 --> 19:01.265
Oh, God! Okay!

19:01.348 --> 19:04.768
Whatever you do,
I want you to be as rough as possible.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.647
There are no limits.
And my safe word is "Mama's calzone."

19:08.730 --> 19:12.151
Ew, gross! Now where's
your little fucker of a friend?

19:12.234 --> 19:13.610
He owes me nipples!

19:13.694 --> 19:14.528
What friend? Who?

19:14.611 --> 19:17.281
Don't play dumb, dummy!
We know Nick started the rumor.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.032
Oh, no, Nick didn't start that rumor.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.327
I know who did,
though, but I'm so shy.

19:22.411 --> 19:27.875
I can't disclose that information unless
you make me almost pass out from pain.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.334
-Oh, fuck! Yes.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.712
Okay. Missy did it. She's Dr. PlainTalk.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.422
-Oh, outrageous!

19:33.505 --> 19:35.757
What? Missy started the rumor?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.969
Oh, God, we knew
Nick hated you, but Missy?

19:39.052 --> 19:40.679
Why would she hate me?

19:40.762 --> 19:43.307
Missy hates you?
I wonder who else hates you.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.641
I don't-- I don't know.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.395
Well, so far, we've got Nick,
Michael Angelo, Cantor Dina, Tito,

19:48.478 --> 19:50.898
Lizer, the cheese girl, the cheese baby!

19:50.981 --> 19:53.233
Why do all these people hate me?

19:53.317 --> 19:57.654
-Is it possible you're a bad person?
-Oh, he's got a point.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.239
I've often worried about that!

19:59.323 --> 20:00.240
Oh, God.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.411
Probably best to just curl up
and fall asleep for a week.

20:04.494 --> 20:08.165
-The world could use a break from you.
-They'll be happy you're gone!

20:08.248 --> 20:11.960
-There's too many creatures in your head!
-Yeah, this does seem like a lot.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.295
Oh god, I can't breathe.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.923
-Hey, honey, Jessi. You okay?

20:16.006 --> 20:18.091
I don't know, are you?

20:18.175 --> 20:20.636
I will be, once I fucking kill Missy!

20:20.719 --> 20:23.931
-Oh, snap. Lola's up in my DMs.

20:24.014 --> 20:27.184
It's an AirDrop, Lump, we all got it.
And it's a video of Jay?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.561
Here we go, ready? Coin…

20:29.645 --> 20:31.104
No coin.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.147
See?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.776
Much like The Giving Tree,
I'm positively stumped.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.570
-More like "Skumped"!
-However does it work?

20:38.654 --> 20:40.530
Babe. I can do the tricks for you,

20:40.614 --> 20:43.075
but it's against the magician's code
to tell you how to do it.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.869
No, that's okay.
I totally respect your code.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.705
You know what?
Fuck it. I trust you, Lola.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.707
-Okay, here's how you do the trick.
-No!

20:50.791 --> 20:52.292
Fuck! No, no, no!

20:52.376 --> 20:54.544
-Throw your phones out the window!
-The secret is…

20:54.628 --> 20:57.464
-I hide it in my ample foreskin.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.217
-No!
-See?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.219
Lola! Why the fuck would you do that?

21:02.302 --> 21:05.472
Because I'm a psycho. Remember, Jay?

21:05.555 --> 21:08.350
Yeah, but you can't be
sending videos to people of Jay's dick.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.476
I think that's a crime.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.603
I don't give a shit
that everyone saw my dick!

21:11.687 --> 21:15.023
That's right. The brilliance
of my diabolical plan

21:15.107 --> 21:18.527
is that I revealed how he does
his stupid magic trick.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.905
Oh, no, I broke the Magician's Code.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.573
I'll be disgraced.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.825
How could you do this?

21:24.908 --> 21:27.494
You called me a name,
so I ruined your life.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.871
Your move, David Copperfuck.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.292
-I have no more moves. You've broken me.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.710
You win, Lola.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.253
The magic is gone.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.298
Good. So, like, mission accomplished.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.465
Go, Lola.

21:40.549 --> 21:44.803
Oh, my God, did you see
Jessi's purple fucking shirt today?

21:44.886 --> 21:47.014
-She's such a tease.
-Yeah.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.308
Wait, what? Did you say "tease"?

21:49.391 --> 21:52.436
Yeah, she's a total slut.
She led me on and then rejected me.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.438
Jessi definitely sucks,

21:54.521 --> 21:57.566
but I don't know
if she actually led you on.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.860
Oh, really? She touched my arm.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.904
Ooh! Okay. Well, let's unpack that,

22:02.988 --> 22:06.074
because I'm not so sure that's
a very fair thing to hate someone for.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.869
Who is this one
to tell us how to hate Jessi?

22:08.952 --> 22:12.664
She called me ugly in front of everyone
after I professed my love!

22:12.748 --> 22:15.083
-She said she wasn't attracted to you…
-Ugh.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.086
…after you, like, cornered her
in front of the whole class.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.255
-Whatever!
-You basically pushed her to say it.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.465
I was there, dude.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.466
Okay, "dude".

22:22.549 --> 22:24.217
What exactly did Jessi do to you?

22:24.301 --> 22:27.095
Talk over you
at some stupid affinity group meeting?

22:27.179 --> 22:30.390
Ooh, see? I never fucked with
that little Creamsicle Nick anyway.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.476
-Uh, excuse you?

22:32.559 --> 22:34.936
Bitch! Jessi has been
running all over my girl.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.688
Y'all new to this hatin' Jessi shit.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.690
It doesn't matter who hated Jessi first.

22:38.774 --> 22:42.152
What matters is
whose hateful flame burns the brightest.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.155
And, girl, I am a phoenix

22:45.238 --> 22:49.618
emerging from
Wendy Williams' morning matcha.

22:49.701 --> 22:53.205
Do not let this little fuck
minimize what she did to you.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.791
Jessi didn't just interrupt me, Nick.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.834
She stole my whole group from me.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.045
She's a jackal.
She's a cracker jackal.

23:00.128 --> 23:04.549
Because you roofied everybody comatose
with your boring-ass plans, you dork.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.551
Well, a dork is a whale's penis,

23:06.635 --> 23:10.305
and I would be proud to be
any part of that noble creature.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.890
Only a dork would know that!

23:11.973 --> 23:13.934
Wow, Jessi was right.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.895
You are ugly inside and out.

23:16.978 --> 23:19.815
No wonder she wouldn't
touch you with a ten-foot dork!

23:19.898 --> 23:23.235
-Hey, Dr. PlainTalk, your nips are mine!

23:23.318 --> 23:25.070
Yes, it's finally happening.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.655
-Boop, boop.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.616
-An altercation has started!

23:30.951 --> 23:34.663
Yes, yes,
whoever wins gets me as a piss boy.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.082
And whoever loses
gets to take a shit in his ass.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.583
-What?
-Trust me, you want it.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.543
Okay. Yeah.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.087
Fuck the high road! Poop in my butt hole!

23:42.170 --> 23:44.423
Take a bite of my Skechers, bitch!

23:44.506 --> 23:45.882
-Hiya!
-Ah!

23:45.966 --> 23:49.219
-Whoa!
-Missy, stop! Please. Somebody help!

23:49.302 --> 23:51.138
Shut up. Fuck you. Eat shit.

23:51.221 --> 23:54.349
-Oh, my God.
-You want some more, huh? Screw you!

23:54.433 --> 23:56.226
And screw Jessi too!

23:56.309 --> 23:58.061
I hate you, Jessi!

23:58.145 --> 24:01.565
-I hate it here! 
-Missy is fucking crazy, okay?

24:01.648 --> 24:03.400
She ripped out my permanent retainer.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.653
I don't know what's going on with her.
She's so different.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.196
That's hate, man.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.032
It'll get inside you,
bring you to your knees,

24:11.116 --> 24:13.577
and make you say shit
you never thought you'd say.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.996
Just like Jason Big-ig-ig-ig-ig-ig-igs!

24:16.079 --> 24:19.291
Oh, God, not again!

24:23.545 --> 24:25.297
What were you thinking, Lols?

24:25.380 --> 24:27.966
What you did was a child pornography.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.509
You're not my dad, Rodney!

24:29.593 --> 24:32.429
-You're just my mom's parole officer.
-Hey!

24:32.512 --> 24:35.056
And it's so obvious
that you're in love with her,

24:35.140 --> 24:38.810
and FYI, she doesn't love anyone
who loves her back.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.521
And that's not a lesson
that I want to learn right now.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.356
Esteemed sorcerers, please!

24:43.440 --> 24:46.902
You have to understand,
I--I was betrayed by the woman I love!

24:46.985 --> 24:49.696
You chose the wand between your legs.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.574
And now you must relinquish your wand

24:52.657 --> 24:54.826
that's in your magician's JanSport.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.119
I understand.

24:59.623 --> 25:03.585
-Hi, Nicky. How was school?
-How was staying home and being stupid?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.837
Oh, shut up. Fuck you. Eat shit.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.048
Missy, I am at a loss.

25:08.131 --> 25:10.008
It wasn't my fault. Jessi started it!

25:10.091 --> 25:13.595
Enough! You're smoking marijuana,
getting into fights at school,

25:13.678 --> 25:14.971
starting rumors?

25:15.055 --> 25:16.806
This isn't the little girl we raised.

25:16.890 --> 25:22.854
Well, you really have become a hateful,
loathsome creature, haven't you, Missy?

25:22.938 --> 25:24.064
Maybe he's right.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.483
I've never gotten in trouble
at school before.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.236
You're an embarrassment and a disgrace!

25:29.319 --> 25:30.862
-Oh!
-Fuck that noise.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.281
-You a bad bitch for choking out Ali.
-Really?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.076
Hell yeah!
You don't need that crusty old wizard,

25:36.159 --> 25:38.245
or your parents, or Nick, or anybody.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.329
You got me, baby.

25:39.412 --> 25:42.332
-Yeah, I do.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.626
-Well, Missy?

25:44.709 --> 25:46.920
-What do you have to say for yourself?
-Missy?

25:47.003 --> 25:50.340
I fucking hate you!
