01:35.472 --> 01:36.973
Jesus Christ!

01:37.474 --> 01:38.975
Damn, that was close.

01:39.476 --> 01:40.977
Look!
Buzzard!

01:42.353 --> 01:44.355
Look at that!

01:46.858 --> 01:50.862
Hey!

01:52.864 --> 01:55.742
Jesus!
That goddamn crazy bird!

01:55.777 --> 01:57.494
He just tried to kill us.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.496
That's your point of view.

01:59.996 --> 02:02.874
Shall we stop and ask the bird
what his was?

02:07.879 --> 02:09.846
Somethin' hit the roof.

02:09.881 --> 02:12.383
So will the chief if we don't grab
this guy Cameron.

02:31.778 --> 02:33.745
Hey, Morton.

02:33.780 --> 02:37.248
Is your ass attached to that machine?

02:37.283 --> 02:41.287
You wiggle it, that's gonna make the ball
go where you want to, huh?

02:44.290 --> 02:46.167
Here you go, babe.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.547
Put a little fat on ya.
I'm gonna get you, Mary.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.425

Come on, stunt guys.
Into the pads.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.544
Townsend, move the crane,
or the plane'll hit it.

11:08.044 --> 11:09.546
Rod, get up!
Candle ready.

11:10.046 --> 11:12.048
All right, that's enough.
Come on, clear.

11:12.549 --> 11:15.051
Let's start passing out the boxes.
Line up. Who wants distance?

11:15.086 --> 11:17.053
Get down into the water.

11:17.428 --> 11:19.430
You need a bath anyway.
Come on.

11:24.185 --> 11:27.438
All right, people, quiet. We're
losing the sun. This is a take.

11:27.939 --> 11:32.068
You're welcome to take pictures, but please
don't move around while we're rolling.

11:32.569 --> 11:34.070
You'll spoil the shot.

11:34.571 --> 11:36.287
Okay, stand by.

11:36.322 --> 11:39.701
This is a five-camera shot-
Cameras A, B, C, D and E.

11:39.826 --> 11:42.078
Scene number 36, take one.
Roll!

11:42.113 --> 11:44.330
Background action.
Speed.

11:44.365 --> 11:46.297
Markers!

11:46.332 --> 11:48.209
- B camera.
- B camera marker!

11:48.244 --> 11:50.211
"A" mark!
Action!

12:19.616 --> 12:22.076
Zoom!

12:24.996 --> 12:27.499
Here he comes again!

12:47.393 --> 12:49.354
Ammo, ammo, ammo!

13:11.126 --> 13:12.627
Medics!

13:13.128 --> 13:14.629
Somebody get the medics!

13:26.891 --> 13:30.895
Cut!
That's a print!

13:38.403 --> 13:41.121
Oh, my God!

13:41.156 --> 13:44.159
Come on, come on.
Look at him.

13:51.332 --> 13:53.835
Oh, my God, it's Sarah Bernhardt.

13:53.870 --> 13:56.355
It's Oscar time.

13:56.390 --> 13:58.840
- Look-
- Come on.

14:00.842 --> 14:03.845
Put the fake head on it.
Hey, Bob!

14:04.345 --> 14:06.848
Knock off the smoke. The shot's over.
Beautiful, Chuck.

14:07.348 --> 14:09.315
You gave everybody a heart attack.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.853
Eli'll hate it. He said he wanted
the shot in one, right?

14:11.888 --> 14:14.821
Now, watch, he'll do six hours
of pickups.

14:14.856 --> 14:17.859
Great, but why do they
always use so much blood?

14:17.894 --> 14:20.879
It ruins the realism,
don't you think?

14:20.914 --> 14:23.865
Asshole.

14:26.367 --> 14:29.370
Come on.
A, B and C camera, over here.

14:33.875 --> 14:36.127
Hey. Hey, you!

14:40.381 --> 14:43.551
Mr. Bailey.

14:43.802 --> 14:46.304
- Mr. Bailey.
- Yes, ma'am?

14:46.805 --> 14:48.807
Are you Raymond Bailey,
the actor?

14:48.890 --> 14:50.391
Yes, ma'am.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.895
May I please have your autograph?

14:54.062 --> 14:56.064
Certainly.

14:59.067 --> 15:02.570
Write, "To Emily, for Eternal Peace."

15:02.605 --> 15:04.572
All right.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.576
I'm certainly glad you're all right.

15:09.577 --> 15:13.081
I lost my husband and my son
in the wars.

15:19.921 --> 15:22.924
All right, come on. Come on,
everybody back behind the ropes.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.927
Let's clear a helicopter pad down there!
Let's go, boys, come on.

15:52.871 --> 15:54.873
What happened on the bridge, Eli?

15:54.956 --> 15:57.459
All the divers found in the car
was the fucking camera.

15:57.959 --> 16:00.462
- And Burt?
- No Burt.

16:00.497 --> 16:02.464
All gone.

16:02.964 --> 16:06.468
They're diving downstream,
searching the riverbanks.

16:06.968 --> 16:08.935
But...

16:08.970 --> 16:11.473
don't say anything
to anyone for a while.

16:11.508 --> 16:14.976
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, yeah.

16:15.011 --> 16:17.444
Jesus Christ.

16:17.479 --> 16:19.731
- What do you wanna do?
- I do not know, Ace.

16:20.231 --> 16:22.198
Telephone my mother...

16:22.233 --> 16:24.736
and have her convince me
it wasn't my fault.

16:25.236 --> 16:27.739
What in the name of God
could have happened?

16:28.239 --> 16:30.116
Jesus Christ.

16:44.005 --> 16:46.007
Aaah!

16:48.885 --> 16:50.386
Hey!

16:50.887 --> 16:54.390
Hey!
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

16:54.425 --> 16:56.392
Here!

16:59.896 --> 17:02.398
It's okay.

17:02.774 --> 17:05.116
I got you. Don't be afraid.
It's all right.

17:05.151 --> 17:08.655
It's all right.

17:08.780 --> 17:12.282
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

17:17.789 --> 17:19.756
Ow!

17:19.790 --> 17:22.759
Jesus!

17:22.794 --> 17:24.761
It's a makeup test.

17:24.796 --> 17:27.298
W- W- Wait a second.

17:27.799 --> 17:29.300
Hold it.

17:29.801 --> 17:31.302
Hold it. Hey.

17:31.803 --> 17:33.805
I know you, don't I?

17:34.305 --> 17:36.808
You're, uh-
I've seen you on TV. You're, uh-

17:36.843 --> 17:39.811
Nina Franklin.

17:43.314 --> 17:46.206
They gotta be crazy to
cover a face like yours.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.219
Only at the end of the film.

17:48.570 --> 17:51.260
- Come on.
- No, no. Rescue me.

17:51.295 --> 17:53.915
- What for?
- Come on. Please?

17:53.950 --> 17:57.454
I've always wanted someone
to rescue me from something.

17:57.489 --> 17:59.956
This is just like in the movies.

18:01.458 --> 18:02.959
I am the movies.

18:13.595 --> 18:15.597
Nina!

18:19.100 --> 18:22.569
Nina, why are you
scaring me to death?

18:22.604 --> 18:26.107
Oh, hell, Eli, it's all ruined now.
I wanted you to see the makeup.

18:26.142 --> 18:29.611
Where were you?

18:29.736 --> 18:32.058
I even got Raymond's autograph,
and he didn't even know.

18:32.084 --> 18:33.239
You'd have been proud of me.

18:33.274 --> 18:35.206
- Chuck?
- Sir?

18:35.241 --> 18:37.709
Stick her into a tub, then bed.

18:37.744 --> 18:41.247
Then I wish to see her in full makeup
and costume again before dinner.

18:43.249 --> 18:44.751
Oh. Hey!

18:45.251 --> 18:46.753
Thank you.

18:47.253 --> 18:50.882
That was really gallant,
rescuing an old lady like that.

18:55.011 --> 18:56.978
One moment!

18:57.013 --> 19:00.016
Follow me, boys.
We'll set up right here.

19:00.517 --> 19:03.144
I, too, should wish to thank you,

19:04.145 --> 19:07.398
and I suggest you don't run away.

19:09.901 --> 19:11.903
What is that, a habit with you?

19:11.938 --> 19:13.905
Also smoke too much.

19:22.163 --> 19:24.130
The bridge.

19:24.165 --> 19:28.169
Yourself and Burt- That was
his name- On that bridge.

19:28.545 --> 19:30.046
Would you tell me what happened?

19:30.547 --> 19:32.889
All I know is,
he tried to run me down.

19:32.924 --> 19:36.893
Really? Now, why on earth would he
do that, I wonder.

19:36.928 --> 19:39.931
Didn't get a chance to ask him.
He was comin' at me too fast.

19:42.433 --> 19:44.295
Wanna get home for Thanksgiving,
you better figure

19:44.321 --> 19:45.962
the guy comin' at you
is tryin' to kill you.

19:46.437 --> 19:48.189
- Learned that from the gooks.
- "Gooks"?

19:48.690 --> 19:51.818
That has a nostalgic ring.
You really did call them gooks?

19:52.193 --> 19:54.195
I thought that was just Time magazine.

19:54.696 --> 19:56.197
It's 'nam.

19:56.698 --> 19:59.701
If I called 'em Wops, nobody would know
what I was talking about.

20:02.704 --> 20:06.708
Get this outta here
before somebody falls.

20:11.212 --> 20:14.257
All right, Ace, that's it. This
time you've had it. Now, where is he?

20:14.292 --> 20:17.267
I'm glad you dropped by. Eli says
there's too many people on the beach.

20:17.302 --> 20:20.805
30 minutes is what you got to get this
equipment off this beach and out of town!

20:20.840 --> 20:22.772
Where's your sense of humor, Jakey?

20:22.807 --> 20:24.875
Tell cross if your men
are on the street after 4:00,

20:24.901 --> 20:26.811
I'm gonna throw
their ass outta town.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.813
- What am I, an asshole?
- Well-

20:29.189 --> 20:30.690
Talking of jail,

20:30.940 --> 20:34.944
would you get very upset if I asked
just how many policemen are after you?

20:34.979 --> 20:37.912
Me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:37.947 --> 20:40.950
The way you ran from the bridge,
the look on your face,

20:40.985 --> 20:43.953
and your charm bracelet-
That's what I'm talking about.

20:43.988 --> 20:46.956
Don't suppose you'd care
to tell me what you did.

20:46.991 --> 20:49.424
Not really.

20:49.459 --> 20:50.960
May I try categories?

20:52.462 --> 20:55.930
- Ever done any stunt work?
- Huh?

20:55.965 --> 20:59.969
You're very fit, very fast on your feet.
You could do it.

21:00.004 --> 21:02.722
Besides, your choices
are a bit limited.

21:03.223 --> 21:05.725
Bullshit!
I don't want to hear any more!

21:05.760 --> 21:07.692
You lie, you break promises.

21:07.727 --> 21:10.069
Now, don't be hasty.

21:10.104 --> 21:13.608
And remember your ass. It's just like
mine. Maybe I can save them both.

21:13.733 --> 21:15.235
Cross, I've gone out of my way,

21:15.735 --> 21:17.237
But this time you really did it.

21:17.737 --> 21:20.240
You don't give a shit about anybody-
Jake!

21:20.740 --> 21:22.242
It's been a rotten morning.

21:22.742 --> 21:24.244
You're hot, you're tired.

21:24.744 --> 21:26.246
Let's go inside, have a drink...

21:26.746 --> 21:28.748
and find out what's displeasing you.

21:29.249 --> 21:31.251
Don't treat me
like these other morons.

21:31.751 --> 21:34.254
You know goddamn well
what's "displeasing" me...

21:34.754 --> 21:37.882
is that Duesenberg on the bottom
of the river with a dead man in it.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.850
That is a public bridge
and a public river.

21:40.885 --> 21:44.389
You go there without permits, without
precautions, and you get a man killed!

21:44.424 --> 21:45.890
- Jake-
- No!

21:46.391 --> 21:47.892
No more bullshit explanations!

21:48.393 --> 21:51.396
Just get outta here before I figure out
how to hang you with a manslaughter charge.

21:51.896 --> 21:54.399
No explanations, Jake.
I do not have any.

21:56.401 --> 22:00.780
- But maybe he does. Go on, Jake, ask him.
- Don't blame me!

22:01.030 --> 22:03.533
Why ever not, Burt?
Because you're a fraud?

22:03.568 --> 22:05.535
Is that it, Burt?

22:06.035 --> 22:09.539
Because you're just a ridiculous
daredevil with a head filled with cement?

22:09.664 --> 22:12.167
Burt here grabs the bread. That's number one
- The bread. Right, Ace?

22:13.668 --> 22:15.135
Right.

22:15.170 --> 22:18.173
He then screws the shot up.
He screws me up, screws you up.

22:18.208 --> 22:21.641
He's a hopeless yo-yo, Jake,
but he's not dead yet.

22:21.676 --> 22:25.180
So do me a favor
- Put your handcuffs on him and heave the son of a bitch into some hole...

22:25.680 --> 22:27.682
where he cannot get hurt.

22:28.183 --> 22:29.684
Is that Burt?

22:39.944 --> 22:41.946
- How did you get out of the car?
- He didn't.

22:42.447 --> 22:44.449
He couldn't get out of a paper bag.

22:44.949 --> 22:47.952
The divers took him out of the car
and brought him here in the chopper.

23:05.470 --> 23:07.472
Let's go.

23:07.722 --> 23:10.225
You wanna ride in the chopper?
We could-

23:11.226 --> 23:14.229
Cross, when these three days are up,

23:14.729 --> 23:16.731
I'm going to arm my men
with shotguns...

23:17.232 --> 23:20.235
and tell them it's open season
on any fruit carrying a camera.

23:20.735 --> 23:22.702
You get my drift, Cross?

23:22.737 --> 23:24.739
I love you, Jake!

23:25.240 --> 23:26.741
That's a beaut, Jake.

23:27.242 --> 23:29.994
Listen, I'll tell you what.
If we get this stuff-

23:31.996 --> 23:33.998
You did that very well.

23:34.033 --> 23:35.965
Hey, I just listened.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.003
There are a few actors only
in the entire world...

23:39.038 --> 23:41.471
who've mastered that art.

23:41.506 --> 23:45.009
Anyway, that was a very good audition.

23:47.262 --> 23:48.763
And the part is yours.

23:49.264 --> 23:51.266
What are you talking about?
What part?

23:51.766 --> 23:53.268
The stunt man.

23:59.274 --> 24:02.277
What about the people
that work for you?

24:02.312 --> 24:05.280
They gonna look at me
and go, "Hi, Burt"?

24:05.315 --> 24:07.247
Do you prefer "Hi, Alice"?

24:07.282 --> 24:10.285
Don't worry about the people
who work for me, my crew.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.787
They'll call you
anything I wish them to.

24:12.822 --> 24:14.754
And I'm not being callous merely.

24:14.789 --> 24:18.793
Burt is a bloody tragedy, but there's
nothing I can do about it, nothing.

24:20.295 --> 24:23.298
I must have this location
for three days,

24:23.333 --> 24:26.766
And you need a place to hide.

24:26.801 --> 24:29.429
Eli, the crew is waiting.
We need the next setup.

24:29.464 --> 24:33.933
The hand!
Close-up of the hand.

24:34.434 --> 24:37.437
- With you in a minute!
- An Eli minute, or a real minute?

24:37.937 --> 24:40.440
By tomorrow the cops are gonna know
exactly what I look like.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.944
Burt, do stop this worrying. You must
have heard, surely, of movie magic.

24:45.069 --> 24:48.288
You shall be a stunt man
who is an actor,

24:48.323 --> 24:51.826
who is a character in a movie,
who is an enemy soldier.

24:51.861 --> 24:54.829
Who'll look for you amongst all those?

24:54.864 --> 24:56.911
People like to believe in things,

24:56.946 --> 24:58.958
And policemen are just people.

24:58.993 --> 25:00.960
Or so I'm told.

25:02.962 --> 25:04.929
Frankly,

25:04.964 --> 25:09.469
our problem is so simple
it's almost beneath us.

25:09.504 --> 25:11.471
Now, listen to me.

25:14.974 --> 25:17.977
That door is the looking glass,

25:18.478 --> 25:19.979
and inside it is wonderland.

25:24.484 --> 25:26.986
Have faith, Alice.

25:27.021 --> 25:29.489
Close your eyes...

25:29.524 --> 25:31.491
and enjoy.

25:33.993 --> 25:35.912
Okay, open your eyes.

25:42.585 --> 25:45.088
Don't touch.
It's still wet.

25:50.593 --> 25:52.845
Yeah, that's nice.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.063
Oh, that's just great.

25:55.098 --> 25:57.600
Well, now, what do you think?
Huh?

25:57.635 --> 25:59.619
Could be worse.

25:59.654 --> 26:01.630
Could be green.

26:01.665 --> 26:03.571
I think I like it.

26:03.606 --> 26:07.610
Of course you do. Ask anybody.
Denise gives great hair.

26:07.645 --> 26:09.612
You got any grass?

26:11.114 --> 26:13.116
Huh?
Mm-mmm.

26:15.994 --> 26:18.997
Oh, well, our leading man
isn't going to like you.

26:19.032 --> 26:20.964
Why not?
You're too good-looking.

26:20.999 --> 26:25.503
His idea of a perfect stunt double
is 200 pounds of hamburger in a blond wig.

26:25.538 --> 26:29.007
What's she like?
I've seen her on TV.

26:30.508 --> 26:33.011
Selling Douche powder,
she's terrific.

26:33.261 --> 26:36.764
But the dog food-
I'm not sure she's sincere.

26:36.799 --> 26:38.641
You sore?

26:38.766 --> 26:40.768
So, what are you sore about?

26:41.269 --> 26:42.770
I'm not sore.

26:43.271 --> 26:45.273
Is that what you meant?

26:45.308 --> 26:47.240
Or did you mean,

26:47.275 --> 26:50.743
what's the real Nina Franklin like,

26:50.778 --> 26:54.282
without the greasepaint and the tinsel,
hmm?

26:54.532 --> 26:56.534
What's she really like underneath?

26:56.569 --> 26:58.411
Hmm?

26:58.536 --> 27:02.415
What do you say about a girl who
wears things like that? Shy, sensitive?

27:02.450 --> 27:04.918
Hmm?

27:08.546 --> 27:10.548
Oh, you're so wet.

27:10.583 --> 27:12.515
Very wet.

27:12.550 --> 27:15.518
Raymond, the explosion.
You saw it.

27:15.553 --> 27:19.557
Now, this is what happens
after a bomb has been dropped.

27:19.592 --> 27:21.451
That's bloody carnage.

27:21.486 --> 27:23.276
And here's the bitter bit.

27:23.311 --> 27:27.315
The bomb was dropped on you
by a man from your own squadron.

27:28.817 --> 27:30.819
All right?

27:33.321 --> 27:35.288
When you're ready.

27:35.323 --> 27:38.827
Bring in the smoke.
Roll the film.

27:38.862 --> 27:40.829
We're rolling.
Slate.

27:40.864 --> 27:42.831
Marker!

27:44.833 --> 27:46.835
And... action, Raymond.

27:50.713 --> 27:52.715
And the fingers move.

27:54.217 --> 27:55.718
And then the hand turns...

28:01.724 --> 28:04.477
Aaaaaah!

28:04.512 --> 28:07.230
Aaaah!

28:07.730 --> 28:09.232
Got you this time, didn't I?

28:09.732 --> 28:12.235
Yes, you've got me
half an hour behind.

28:12.270 --> 28:14.077
Is he alive down there?

28:14.112 --> 28:18.116
What's the difference? If he's dead,
all we gotta do is bury the hand.

28:18.151 --> 28:21.119
I thought we'd cheer the chief up
a little today.

28:21.154 --> 28:23.639
You mean about Burt.

28:23.674 --> 28:26.089
Yeah.
Any more word?

28:26.124 --> 28:29.127
No, Raymond, I'm afraid not.
No, there isn't.

28:30.128 --> 28:33.131
And no picture ever made
is worth it.

28:33.631 --> 28:36.083
I'll never understand why
these guys take the chances.

28:36.109 --> 28:36.885
I don't know.

28:36.920 --> 28:40.263
Probably all we know
is that we shall die...

28:41.764 --> 28:45.017
of nothing more important
than wrinkles.

28:45.052 --> 28:48.271
And it makes us so scared,
so crazy,

28:48.306 --> 28:50.273
we'll do anything-

28:50.773 --> 28:53.276
Fight wars, fight windmills,

28:54.277 --> 28:56.279
go off bridges, anything.

28:58.281 --> 29:01.785
Which is what our film is about.
Or did no one tell you that?

29:01.820 --> 29:03.787
Burt!

29:05.288 --> 29:07.290
Come here to me.

29:13.296 --> 29:15.298
Raymond Bailey.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.300
It's a pleasure.

29:17.335 --> 29:19.267
Mine.

29:19.302 --> 29:21.770
My new cock and balls?
Not new.

29:21.805 --> 29:25.308
It's fairly important we don't
let that circulate for a while.

29:25.343 --> 29:29.312
So in the meantime, let's make believe
that he is Burt.

29:29.347 --> 29:32.280
But no longer known
as brass-balled Burt.

29:32.315 --> 29:35.819
Ever since his fortunate escape,
we'll refer to him as Lucky.

29:35.854 --> 29:37.786
Eli.
Uh-huh?

29:37.821 --> 29:40.281
- Camera's still rolling.
- Cut it.

29:49.624 --> 29:51.626
Done any stunt work?

29:51.661 --> 29:53.593
Not really.

29:53.628 --> 29:57.097
"Not really"?
You have or you haven't.

29:57.132 --> 30:00.635
I got out of 'nam in one piece.
That's a hell of a stunt.

30:00.670 --> 30:02.602
Ancient history.

30:02.637 --> 30:04.639
Seems like yesterday to me.

30:04.674 --> 30:06.606
You, uh-

30:06.641 --> 30:10.103
You think you can jump from that tower
to the platform over there?

30:13.106 --> 30:15.073
To save my ass once,

30:15.108 --> 30:18.653
I jumped out of a banana tree into
a cart full of buffalo shit.

30:18.688 --> 30:21.114
Count?
We'll see.

30:22.115 --> 30:24.388
Put these on.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.543
Where do they go?

30:26.578 --> 30:28.663
Under the pants.

30:38.131 --> 30:41.134
You think you can jump
from there to there?

30:42.635 --> 30:44.637
From there to there?

30:48.141 --> 30:49.642
Okey-dokey.

30:53.646 --> 30:55.613
Oh!
Very good!

30:55.648 --> 30:58.651
Except you're dead. Your brains
are scattered all over the pavement.

30:58.686 --> 31:01.654
I mean, you should land
in a tuck, and then roll.

31:01.689 --> 31:03.656
Show me, sergeant.

31:14.417 --> 31:16.419
Very fancy.

31:20.590 --> 31:22.592
Very fancy.

31:26.429 --> 31:28.932
Oooh!

31:29.349 --> 31:31.351
Okay?
It's better.

31:32.352 --> 31:35.355
My specialty's the broad jump.

31:35.855 --> 31:37.857
And Burt's specialty was drowning.

31:38.358 --> 31:40.360
One daredevil on this picture
was enough.

31:40.693 --> 31:45.198
What the hell is Eli thinking, sending me
a smart-ass kid when I need a stunt man?

31:45.233 --> 31:47.200
It's different when you're running
across those roofs...

31:47.235 --> 31:49.167
and they're pumping tracer bullets
over your head.

31:49.202 --> 31:54.207
I was runnin' for 26 months with guys
shootin' at my head, not over my head.

31:54.242 --> 31:56.209
I'm here. I'm alive.

31:56.709 --> 32:01.214
I knew daredevils, and I ain't got nothin'
against 'em. It's just they're all dead.

32:01.714 --> 32:03.716
So how about givin' me a break?

32:05.135 --> 32:07.137
You puttin' me on?
Huh?

32:07.172 --> 32:09.104
Me?

32:09.139 --> 32:12.142
I wouldn't know how to do that.

32:14.644 --> 32:16.146
Can you imagine?

32:16.646 --> 32:19.149
Eli's doing a World War I film
without horses.

32:19.649 --> 32:22.652
You know the stunts I could do with
four runaway horses pulling a caisson?

32:25.155 --> 32:28.158
Next time, hit me higher. What's Eli
got against horses? I love horses.

32:28.658 --> 32:30.160
Don't butter me up.

32:41.171 --> 32:44.924
We'll draw a sight line for you to follow
down the roof while you're rolling.

32:44.959 --> 32:48.261
Now, it's not very difficult,
but this is where you gotta think.

32:49.929 --> 32:52.397
Your mind can't be on snatch.

32:52.432 --> 32:55.150
It's gotta be on
grabbing that gutter.

32:55.185 --> 32:58.153
Or my brains are all over
the pavement again, right?

32:58.188 --> 33:00.232
A good falling horse makes
more money in four minutes

33:00.258 --> 33:02.275
than a bank president
does in a year.

33:02.310 --> 33:05.278
The picture's not over.
Maybe you'll still get your chance.

33:05.313 --> 33:07.245
Marker.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.283
But all they care about is story.

33:10.318 --> 33:13.286
Tsk.

33:15.789 --> 33:17.791
Now, here's where the scuffle ends.

33:18.291 --> 33:20.794
When that drainpipe
breaks loose and falls,

33:20.829 --> 33:22.761
you'll hit that awning.

33:22.796 --> 33:24.449
Then ol' Eli yells "Cut,"
and ol' Raymond takes

33:24.475 --> 33:25.965
your place for the
close-ups and the glory.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.469
That's the scene where the Germans
catch him and throw him in a nuthouse.

33:29.504 --> 33:31.436
They're shooting that down there now.

33:31.471 --> 33:33.973
That's gonna hold me?
That wouldn't hold water.

33:34.008 --> 33:36.441
It's not a real awning.
It's a catcher.

33:36.476 --> 33:40.480
Now, it's no different up here
than it is on the ground.

33:40.515 --> 33:42.982
It's the same gag,
just a little scarier.

33:43.233 --> 33:45.735
- But that's what you get paid for.
- Yeah?

33:46.236 --> 33:48.238
- How much?
- Ah, stealin' candy with this one.

33:48.738 --> 33:50.240
You get 600 bucks.

33:50.740 --> 33:53.243
Jesus! Christ!
Watch it, will ya!

33:54.744 --> 33:57.747
What do you think a stunt man is?

33:57.782 --> 33:59.714
He's a professional.

33:59.749 --> 34:02.217
If the camera jams,
you get 600 bucks,

34:02.252 --> 34:04.754
and if Eli says do it again,
you get another 600.

34:04.789 --> 34:07.257
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

34:07.292 --> 34:10.760
Yeow!
Six hundred fuckin' bucks!

34:12.762 --> 34:15.723
Jesus Christ, what a dummy.
Yaaaaah!

34:16.181 --> 34:18.768
It's a nightmare!

34:30.697 --> 34:35.159
Six hundred fucking
beautiful dollars! Yahoo!

34:35.195 --> 34:37.127
All right, cut!

34:37.161 --> 34:40.165
Cut, cut, cut! Hold it!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.132
What the hell is going on
up there?

34:43.168 --> 34:46.670
Somebody find out who's making
all that noise! Oh, shut up, Whitey.

34:46.706 --> 34:49.674
I'm not happy anyway.
It ran one minute, three seconds.

34:49.708 --> 34:52.444
Wardrobe, I need a new jacket!
Wardrobe!

34:52.478 --> 34:55.145
I don't need hair!
Give her the hook.

34:55.179 --> 34:58.183
For Christ's sake, Eli!
Time. Money. Time!

34:58.218 --> 35:00.650
Ahh!

35:00.685 --> 35:03.188
Come on, for Christ's-
Let's-

35:03.223 --> 35:05.207
Get your ass up there-

35:05.242 --> 35:07.157
What's wrong, Eli?

35:07.192 --> 35:10.195
Wrong? The scene's wrong.
That's what's wrong.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.697
The scene plays like a dream.

35:12.732 --> 35:14.699
Plays like Marat/Sade.

35:16.701 --> 35:18.668
It was shit.

35:18.703 --> 35:20.670
Shit?
Shit, huh?

35:20.705 --> 35:23.673
Who was that that called me
when he first read it,

35:23.708 --> 35:27.670
woke me up in the middle of the night
raving about the magical madhouse scene?

35:27.705 --> 35:30.173
Who was that?
My upstairs maid, Eli?

35:30.208 --> 35:32.140
It's still shit.

35:32.175 --> 35:34.177
I don't need this aggravation.

35:35.303 --> 35:37.270
Problem is, Eli, way back when,

35:37.305 --> 35:41.810
when you were all so charged up about
making a great big antiwar statement,

35:41.845 --> 35:43.777
they wouldn't let you.

35:43.812 --> 35:46.780
Well, now they'll let you,
but you haven't got a war.

35:46.815 --> 35:50.318
What you do have, my friend,
is a great deal of egg on your face.

35:50.353 --> 35:52.337
Vietnam is long since gone,

35:52.372 --> 35:54.287
and it's too damn late.

35:54.322 --> 35:57.325
This film I'm making is not about
fighting war, Sam.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.417
Oh? Really?

35:59.452 --> 36:01.454
No, it's about fighting windmills.

36:01.955 --> 36:03.421
You tell him, Eli.

36:03.456 --> 36:07.961
Appalling though it is, war isn't the
disease. It's merely one of the symptoms.

36:07.996 --> 36:10.964
The rooms are full,
the town is sold out...

36:10.999 --> 36:13.233
and I just hired a second crew.

36:13.268 --> 36:15.468
Eli, pray, what is the disease?

36:15.969 --> 36:17.470
Ah, Sam, interesting.

36:17.971 --> 36:19.472
Define the disease,

36:19.973 --> 36:21.474
write me a new scene,

36:21.975 --> 36:25.478
the egg will drop from my face,
and we shall have a relevant screenplay.

36:25.603 --> 36:27.605
Maybe.

36:27.730 --> 36:30.859
Ask him, for he might know.
Mightn't you, Lucky?

36:31.359 --> 36:32.861
Tell us, how did you like Vietnam?

36:32.896 --> 36:34.863
How'd you like the plague?

36:40.118 --> 36:41.744
Were you drafted?

36:43.496 --> 36:45.713
- No.
- There you go, Sam.

36:45.748 --> 36:50.253
Another one.
He hates war, but he enlisted.

36:50.753 --> 36:54.257
You fought for two years, actually
out there for two years killing people.

36:55.758 --> 36:57.725
I didn't kill that many people.

36:57.760 --> 37:02.265
Ah, you're modest, Lucky, and there is
no need, for we all dig a little violence.

37:02.765 --> 37:06.144
- What was that you said on the beach?
- About what?

37:06.179 --> 37:08.396
Something about
being home for Thanksgiving.

37:08.897 --> 37:13.777
That you, uh, you'd better figure the
guy comin' at you is tryin' to kill you?

37:14.152 --> 37:15.653
That's it.

37:16.154 --> 37:18.621
Sam, perhaps that's
what our film is about.

37:18.656 --> 37:22.118
Being scared shitless, whistling
in the dark, inventing enemies.

37:22.153 --> 37:24.621
- Are you finished?
- No, I'm not finished. Does it-

37:24.656 --> 37:26.588
Everybody wants to
take things away from me.

37:26.623 --> 37:29.090
You wanna take my scene,
she wants to take my food.

37:29.125 --> 37:31.466
You got another scene. I'll
write you another scene.

37:31.492 --> 37:32.128
Thank you.

37:32.163 --> 37:34.596
It won't make
a goddamn bit of difference.

37:34.631 --> 37:38.134
Studio'll cut 'em all out anyway
like they do everything else.

37:38.510 --> 37:41.387
All you're gonna have left
is a bunch of swell battle scenes,

37:41.422 --> 37:43.389
which they said looked just terrific.

37:43.640 --> 37:47.143
What'd they say about me? I know.
Never mind. Take a guess. Turkey.

37:47.178 --> 37:49.110
Yeah.

37:49.145 --> 37:51.898
- Well, they won't cut my scenes out.
- No? What makes you so special?

37:53.274 --> 37:56.778
Because they know that if they
touch my film, I'll kill them.

37:56.903 --> 37:58.870
You mean, bang.

37:58.905 --> 38:00.907
Kill 'em just like that.

38:01.783 --> 38:04.786
No, I'll kill them,

38:05.787 --> 38:07.789
and then I'll eat them.

38:08.164 --> 38:09.666
That's disgusting.

38:10.166 --> 38:12.133
Waste not, want not.

38:12.168 --> 38:15.171
They call him Eli the terrible.

38:15.206 --> 38:18.174
Sam, this picture is my child.

38:18.424 --> 38:20.802
What would you say if the studio said
your daughter Jennifer would look better...

38:21.302 --> 38:22.804
with her fingers chopped off?

38:24.305 --> 38:26.272
Well,

38:26.307 --> 38:28.274
being an insecure writer,

38:28.309 --> 38:32.313
I'd call my agent
and get a second opinion.

38:38.820 --> 38:40.321
If you'll excuse me-

38:40.822 --> 38:43.074
- Don't go away, Burt. I want you.
- Jake.

38:43.109 --> 38:45.326
What an unexpected but delightful...
shock.

38:45.361 --> 38:47.794
I am not talkin' to you.

38:47.829 --> 38:51.332
I understand you got that film out of
the Duesenberg. It's at the lab, Jake.

38:51.367 --> 38:54.300
I am talking to this gentleman.
I wanna see that film.

38:54.335 --> 38:57.338
Tell the chief of police it'll be our
pleasure as soon as we get it back.

38:57.373 --> 38:59.806
- But ask him why.
- Why?

38:59.841 --> 39:03.344
You can tell your Mr. Cross that this
inquiry comes from a source so high,

39:03.845 --> 39:06.848
It is not his to question,
it is his to do it or else.

39:07.348 --> 39:10.852
Somebody they're looking for may have
been on the road when the car went off.

39:10.887 --> 39:13.354
- Burt, you see anybody?
- Uh-uh.

39:14.856 --> 39:18.359
Hey, was your hair always blond?

39:18.860 --> 39:22.829
Yeah. She sprays it every day
so I'll look like Raymond.

39:22.864 --> 39:26.868
Would you tell the chief of police
that Burt was so busy being brilliant...

39:26.903 --> 39:30.371
he wouldn't have noticed sweet Jesus
Christ walking across the water.

39:30.406 --> 39:32.390
He wouldn't have noticed.

39:32.425 --> 39:34.340
Has anybody seen this man?

39:34.375 --> 39:36.843
Burt, you have it upside-down.
The eyes go on the top.

39:36.878 --> 39:40.882
Couple of telephone linemen saw
this guy Cameron headed this way.

39:47.889 --> 39:50.391
Oh. Looks like a fine,
clean-cut kid.

39:50.892 --> 39:53.985
I know a lot of angry,
weary people who don't happen to think so.

39:54.020 --> 39:57.899
Really. Would you ask the chief of police
what it was that this young man has done?

39:57.934 --> 40:00.401
This guy is wanted by every-
Give me that!

40:00.652 --> 40:03.154
The minute that film gets here,
you give me a call, okay?

40:03.530 --> 40:06.498
How was Jill last night, Jake?

40:06.533 --> 40:09.250
- Jake and Jill.
- Clap, clap, clap.

40:09.285 --> 40:12.288
Enough of this.
It's time to go dancin' and partyin'!

40:12.323 --> 40:15.308
All right, as long as you're back
in 90 minutes.

40:15.343 --> 40:18.570
But remember, it's a shooting night
for some of us.

40:18.605 --> 40:21.798
For those of us who give a shit.
I give a shit.

40:51.661 --> 40:54.414
Aah! Raymond!

40:54.449 --> 40:57.132
Oh, you nut.

40:57.167 --> 41:00.670
I bet they're looking for that guy
who killed all those campers in-

41:00.705 --> 41:03.138
What are you doing to my foot?

41:03.173 --> 41:06.141
Is this a gift
from William S. Hart?

41:06.176 --> 41:08.643
Too many campers.
You have to weed them out.

41:08.678 --> 41:11.646
Imagine waiting an hour at a roadblock.
You brownies!

41:11.681 --> 41:14.684
We should have waited. It wouldn't
have been an hour. She's right!

41:14.719 --> 41:17.454
We should be dancing!
I agree, my little kumquat!

41:17.489 --> 41:20.190
What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?

41:20.225 --> 41:22.657
My kumquat, my lovely-
My rose petal.

41:22.692 --> 41:25.695
What could I possibly have done?

42:14.744 --> 42:16.746
What next?

42:17.747 --> 42:20.250
Gonna rescue the maiden
from the tower?

42:20.285 --> 42:22.252
Hi.

42:24.003 --> 42:26.471
It does look pretty high.

42:26.506 --> 42:29.509
- Are you worried about tomorrow?
- Not much.

42:33.012 --> 42:36.516
If there was any real danger,
Eli wouldn't let me do it, would he?

42:36.551 --> 42:40.395
Oh, no.
I'm sure it's safe.

42:40.430 --> 42:42.021
Okay, you jump.

42:45.525 --> 42:47.492
Uh, okay.

42:47.527 --> 42:49.994
Okay. Come on.

42:50.029 --> 42:51.996
What, right now?
Yeah, right now.

42:52.031 --> 42:54.499
Uh-
Look, I'm afraid of heights.

42:54.534 --> 42:57.502
I'm gonna freeze up there.
I'll give you a push.

42:57.537 --> 43:01.541
- That's what friends are for.
- Uh, I think I hear my mother calling.

43:01.576 --> 43:03.508
Let her call.

43:03.543 --> 43:06.045
Wait!

43:09.799 --> 43:12.517
Oh, no. I don't like it.

43:12.552 --> 43:15.520
This is terrifying.
This isn't funny.

43:15.555 --> 43:18.148
You're crazy.
You're gonna get killed just like Burt.

43:18.183 --> 43:21.686
It's not that bad. Chuck says it's like
taking candy from a baby.

43:21.721 --> 43:23.688
Stop it.

43:24.814 --> 43:26.281
I'm going! I'm-
Hey!

43:26.316 --> 43:29.033
- What's wrong?
- It's just dumb.

43:29.068 --> 43:33.573
It's so incredibly dumb to just
strut around, trying to talk brave.

43:38.578 --> 43:40.580
You are scared,

43:41.080 --> 43:42.582
aren't you?

43:44.584 --> 43:46.586
Not really.

43:48.087 --> 43:50.089
Yes, you are.

43:52.091 --> 43:54.093
You're trembling.

43:55.595 --> 43:59.599
So are you,
and you're not even gonna jump.

44:10.735 --> 44:13.488
And hit two!

44:20.245 --> 44:23.248
I could kill the supers,
fill from behind...

44:23.283 --> 44:25.715
and give you a halo around the tower.

44:25.750 --> 44:29.016
I do not have the time, Gabe.
It's only an establishing shot.

44:29.042 --> 44:30.755
It's only two seconds on screen.

44:30.790 --> 44:34.008
No, I don't have the time.
You have six minutes, Gabe.

44:34.043 --> 44:35.975
I gotta have seven.

44:36.010 --> 44:38.012
- Six and a half.
- Six, forty-five.

44:38.047 --> 44:40.014
- Six, thirty-five.
- Done. Henry.

44:41.015 --> 44:43.483
Children!

44:43.518 --> 44:45.985
We are lighting!

44:46.020 --> 44:49.524
If you have noticed this,
you may be of use to us.

44:49.559 --> 44:52.527
Would you stand up
and face the sea...

44:52.562 --> 44:54.529
so we can see your profile.

44:55.530 --> 44:59.534
Light this, Eli!

45:01.661 --> 45:04.838
Oh, thank you for the tour.
It was so informative.

45:04.873 --> 45:08.376
I'm going to write father. He's so
interested in God and things like that.

45:08.411 --> 45:10.378
Good evening.
Want a lift?

45:10.413 --> 45:12.345
Oh, Christ, Eli.

45:12.380 --> 45:14.347
Palm trees.
Yet more palm trees.

45:14.382 --> 45:18.852
Who had the audacity to put palm trees
there? They will be in every shot.

45:18.887 --> 45:21.239
And what are palm trees
doing on a battlefield

45:21.265 --> 45:23.141
in Europe during the
First World War?

45:23.176 --> 45:26.644
Answer me that, Nina,
the actress so fair,

45:26.679 --> 45:29.612
who fancied a man with blond hair.

45:29.647 --> 45:33.651
But Raymond discovers,
as he lifts up the covers,

45:33.686 --> 45:36.654
that his double, young Lucky, is there.

45:37.030 --> 45:38.997
- Eli!
- Now- Yes?

45:39.032 --> 45:40.999
It's gotten to the point...

45:41.034 --> 45:44.287
where I have to check under the stopper
in the bathtub when I take a shower...

45:44.322 --> 45:46.289
to make sure I have some privacy!

45:48.917 --> 45:51.419
Thank you, one and all,

45:51.454 --> 45:53.046
and good night.

45:58.051 --> 46:00.018
Step right up, folks.

46:00.053 --> 46:03.681
Ride the ride of the century
on Eli's killer crane.

46:03.716 --> 46:06.184
Get in.
I have a present for you.

46:07.185 --> 46:09.187
Thanks.
I'll walk.

46:09.222 --> 46:11.154
Ah, youth, hot youth.

46:11.189 --> 46:14.692
In town for six hours only, captures
the leading lady. Can't be bad.

46:14.727 --> 46:16.910
Shouldn't be too depressed.

46:16.945 --> 46:21.950
Is it okay to be depressed about you
showin' the cops the film?

46:21.985 --> 46:24.953
You don't really trust me,
do you?

46:25.203 --> 46:26.704
Come here to me!

46:28.206 --> 46:30.173
You constantly amaze me.

46:30.208 --> 46:33.176
You don't go to movies.
What are you, a communist?

46:33.211 --> 46:36.679
What were those handcuffs?
Some sort of decoy, disguise?

46:36.714 --> 46:41.219
Did you not know that King Kong
the first was just 3'6" tall?

46:41.719 --> 46:44.222
He only came up
to Fay Wray's bellybutton.

46:44.722 --> 46:48.726
If god could do the tricks that we can do,
he'd be a happy man.

46:48.977 --> 46:52.605
What are you so worried about
the police and the film for?

46:52.640 --> 46:54.607
What am I worried
about the police for?

46:54.642 --> 46:56.609
Look over here, son.

47:00.363 --> 47:02.365
Look through there.

47:04.868 --> 47:08.371
Lookin' for big, bad Cameron.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.002
- This my present?
- No.

47:14.037 --> 47:16.004
Your present is some advice.

47:16.504 --> 47:18.471
Keep it.

47:18.506 --> 47:21.474
You're wearing that look again,
that gleam. It's so hostile.

47:21.509 --> 47:24.512
You're like some sprinter about to set
a record for the 60-yard dash.

47:24.547 --> 47:26.531
Is that why all the fuzz
are chasing you?

47:26.566 --> 47:28.481
What are you,
some sort of sexual freak...

47:28.516 --> 47:31.019
dashing across America in spurts
with your fly open?

47:31.054 --> 47:32.770
You're close.

47:33.771 --> 47:35.739
What's your advice?

47:35.774 --> 47:39.778
Button your fly and be at the airport
on Sunday with the rest of the crew.

47:40.278 --> 47:42.781
You're going to fly with us to
where the setting sun bleeds...

47:42.816 --> 47:45.749
into a million swimming pools
a man can hide in.

47:45.784 --> 47:49.788
- You do swim as well as run?
- I can swim like a fish.

47:52.165 --> 47:54.667
Why are you tryin' to save my ass?

47:57.170 --> 48:02.175
Because you're as crazy as the young man
I'm making this film about.

48:03.676 --> 48:08.181
Besides, I've fallen madly in love with
the dark side of your nature.

48:09.933 --> 48:13.186
Okay, everybody clear.

48:13.686 --> 48:16.689
- Eine korpshere.
- The rest, over there.

48:17.190 --> 48:18.691
Move!
Speed!

48:19.192 --> 48:20.693
- And action!
- Now!

48:21.194 --> 48:23.071
Go!

48:40.213 --> 48:42.173
Aah!
Holy Jesus!

48:44.092 --> 48:45.718
Go!

50:24.025 --> 50:26.528
Aaah!

50:31.866 --> 50:33.785
Haah!

50:40.792 --> 50:42.293
- Are we off camera?
- No, we're still-

50:44.796 --> 50:46.297
What the shit's going on here?

50:46.798 --> 50:49.300
It's 10:00 in the morning.
Take your toys and go play on the beach!

51:04.399 --> 51:07.402
Oh! Jesus Christ.

51:13.408 --> 51:15.410
What are you doin'?

51:15.827 --> 51:18.079
Turn loose of my legs.
That's not the rou-

51:32.343 --> 51:34.846
A piece of cake.
Piece of-

51:35.847 --> 51:37.849
Don't stand there.
Go!

51:38.099 --> 51:39.601
Go!

52:10.131 --> 52:12.133
Take him alive!

52:51.131 --> 52:54.134
- What the hell is going on here?
- Take a number!

52:54.169 --> 52:57.602
Are you a man yet?

52:57.637 --> 53:00.640
Let go of me!
Let go of me! No!

53:29.169 --> 53:30.670
Cut!

53:31.171 --> 53:34.174
You got all that?

53:34.674 --> 53:36.176
You got through the door?

53:39.679 --> 53:41.181
Beautiful!

53:42.682 --> 53:44.649
A lot of balls!
Great gag!

53:44.684 --> 53:47.687
What a number that was.
Hey, man, you wanna split the adjustment?

53:47.722 --> 53:50.690
I'll need a crab Dolly
with a zoom for their close-up.

53:50.725 --> 53:53.158
I'm so proud of you I could just die.

53:53.193 --> 53:55.660
Move half a dozen from
up there, strip them.

53:55.695 --> 53:58.698
My hero. Put some light through
the stained glass window, Gabe.

53:58.733 --> 54:01.201
The brothel is supposed to be
in a bloody church!

54:01.236 --> 54:03.220
Why didn't you tell me about the awning?

54:03.255 --> 54:05.170
- I could've been killed.
- No chance.

54:05.205 --> 54:09.209
You were in your mother's arms from
the time you hit that breakaway skylight.

54:09.244 --> 54:12.712
Those stunt men you fell on
would've got you out of anything.

54:12.747 --> 54:16.216
Stunt men?
The one with the tits, and the other guy.

54:16.466 --> 54:17.967
Raymond!
Raymond.

54:18.468 --> 54:19.969
Why didn't you tell me?

54:20.470 --> 54:21.971
Afraid I'd chicken out?

54:22.472 --> 54:24.974
Eli likes things spontaneous.
Thinks it makes it look more real.

54:26.976 --> 54:28.978
You're okay.
What do you want?

54:29.479 --> 54:31.446
Not to think I'm going crazy.

54:31.481 --> 54:33.951
Has anyone seen Raymond?
A.J., how long was that?

54:33.977 --> 54:35.235
Twenty-Seven seconds!

54:35.270 --> 54:36.826
Is Raymond here?

54:36.861 --> 54:39.829
Raymond, did you see that?
Were you watching carefully?

54:39.864 --> 54:43.868
What can I say? I'm a brave son of a bitch.
We're doing coverage.

54:43.903 --> 54:47.372
Camera here, I fancy.
Gabe! Anyone seen Gabe?

54:47.407 --> 54:49.391
I'm around here.
How big?

54:49.426 --> 54:51.376
- Fifty.
- Fifty. Uh, Henry!

54:51.411 --> 54:53.645
Don't blind the eagle.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.845
I owe you 600 bucks.

54:55.880 --> 54:59.884
Anything bothered you,
I'll be happy to do it again.

54:59.919 --> 55:01.476
Sam!

55:01.511 --> 55:05.014
I can't figure it out. I can't take
my eyes off the son of a bitch.

55:06.516 --> 55:09.018
I feel like thankin' him
'cause I fell on my ass.

55:09.053 --> 55:11.020
It's just a crush.

55:12.522 --> 55:15.990
No, you're quite right. A 75.

55:16.025 --> 55:19.994
And, uh, Sam.
What does Sam think?

55:20.029 --> 55:24.534
Eli, do you know that when I read
the insane asylum scene for my family,

55:24.569 --> 55:29.306
my oldest son shook my hand
for the first time in his whole life?

55:29.341 --> 55:34.043
So why is it, Eli, why is it
that your vulgar little scene...

55:34.078 --> 55:37.046
turns out to be so much more moving,

55:37.081 --> 55:39.048
so much more impassioned?

55:39.549 --> 55:41.050
I don't know, Sam.

55:41.551 --> 55:44.053
Possibly because we realize
that our friend the enemy...

55:44.554 --> 55:47.056
may just be a poor, horny slob,
like yourself,

55:47.091 --> 55:49.075
falling into the nearest whorehouse.

55:49.110 --> 55:51.025
That's possible, is it, Lucky? Tell me.

55:51.060 --> 55:54.063
When the stunt man's tit hit you
in the mouth, was it just another tit,

55:54.098 --> 55:56.065
or did it taste German?

55:58.568 --> 56:02.071
It tasted lousy.
But what do I know?

56:02.572 --> 56:05.540
Why don't you try it, Eli?
You're the expert in bad taste.

56:05.575 --> 56:08.778
Ah, sounds like the soldier
boy's feelings have been hurt.

56:08.804 --> 56:09.579
No, no.

56:09.614 --> 56:12.547
It's just that I don't know
nothin' about Germans.

56:12.582 --> 56:15.585
- Where I was, we only raped gooks.
- Is that why you're wanted?

56:16.085 --> 56:18.087
You got it.

56:18.213 --> 56:20.548
Now, gas is illegal
on the battlefield.

56:21.049 --> 56:25.053
Bullets, however, are legal on a battlefield,
but not legal in the prison system.

56:25.303 --> 56:27.771
Aww!
Hey, look at that.

56:27.806 --> 56:30.558
- Did you do that, Gabe?
- Yeah.

56:30.593 --> 56:33.026
That's you.
Shh!

56:33.061 --> 56:36.564
- Hey!
- Is that the way it looks in the camera?

56:36.599 --> 56:38.566
Didn't look that way when we shot it.

56:38.691 --> 56:41.820
Shut up, children. I can't think.

56:47.826 --> 56:50.829
How'd they, uh, get the film developed
so fast?

57:03.091 --> 57:05.093
What's the matter with you?

57:06.594 --> 57:09.597
Don't let the fact that Eli treats you
as an equal go to your head,

57:10.098 --> 57:11.599
because you're not.

57:12.100 --> 57:14.602
Oh, Nina, we're trying to
watch these wretched dailies.

57:14.637 --> 57:17.570
I'm sorry, Eli.

57:17.605 --> 57:20.608
- He can say whatever he wants to, right?
- That's right.

57:20.643 --> 57:22.610
That's great.

57:23.111 --> 57:26.114
What is going on in that
dim little brain of yours?

57:26.149 --> 57:29.082
How dare you open your mouth
to him like that.

57:29.117 --> 57:32.620
Have you the vaguest idea what he's trying
to say to people with this film?

57:32.655 --> 57:36.124
- That man is the kindest, the most dedicated-
- Nina!

57:36.159 --> 57:38.626
You can go... now.

57:46.593 --> 57:49.185
Who says things don't change?

57:49.220 --> 57:52.223
Try to get one of our guys
to do that in a B-52.

58:03.067 --> 58:06.571
It was a masterpiece.
A masterpiece.

58:07.071 --> 58:09.038
Gee, fellas, I liked it.
I don't know.

58:09.073 --> 58:13.077
- Jesus, Eli, I'm sorry. We'll do it again.
- Bad, Chuck. Yes.

58:13.112 --> 58:15.580
It's so awful, it's beautiful.
I do wish I could use it.

58:16.080 --> 58:17.756
That's all we need.

58:17.791 --> 58:19.584
We need something, Sam,
and damn well you know it.

58:19.619 --> 58:21.551
- Something better.
- How better?

58:21.586 --> 58:25.590
- Something less boring, something crazier.
- Mm-hmm.

58:26.090 --> 58:29.093
A dead man's boots are dropped
over his own airfield out of chivalry-

58:29.128 --> 58:32.096
That's not crazy enough?
They did it in a film called "Wings".

58:32.597 --> 58:34.564
- Even the dummy was bored.
- Please, Eli.

58:34.599 --> 58:37.602
You simply will not accept the fact
that we are living on borrowed time.

58:37.852 --> 58:42.822
Borrowed time. We're shaking
a finger at them, Sam, and we shouldn't.

58:42.857 --> 58:46.861
If we've anything to say, it's best to slip
it in while they're all laughing, crying...

58:46.896 --> 58:49.381
...and jerking off
at all the sex and violence.

58:49.416 --> 58:53.143
- He should do something outrageous.
- Like what?

58:53.178 --> 58:56.871
Like... catching an authentic
stench of madness...

58:56.906 --> 58:59.339
behind all that good, clean fun.

58:59.374 --> 59:02.877
Why did we pick World War I in the first
place, the ultimate romantic insanity-

59:02.912 --> 59:04.594
- Like what, Eli?
- I don't know like what!

59:04.629 --> 59:07.972
Like what young Lucky might do were he
to be on the wing of that aeroplane.

59:08.007 --> 59:12.011
Picture that, Sam, for it'd be a bloody
sight more real than that plastic dummy.

59:12.046 --> 59:15.014
Ah, reality, reality.
Is that what you're after?

59:15.049 --> 59:17.482
I thought you wanted
something outrageous.

59:17.517 --> 59:21.020
Reality can be pretty outrageous.
Think of the lucky young soldier boy there.

59:21.055 --> 59:23.523
Three days ago, what was he?
A young turkey scuffling around.

59:23.558 --> 59:27.026
Now he's hurtling off
bloody great buildings.

59:27.061 --> 59:28.618
He's zooming through the air,

59:28.653 --> 59:30.995
breaking his balls doing stunts
he can't have dreamt of.

59:31.030 --> 59:34.534
Tell me, Lucky, what would you do if you
were in that airplane and about to die?

59:36.035 --> 59:39.538
I'd probably dance for joy.
I might even do a jig.

59:39.573 --> 59:43.042
- A jig? Terrific.
- We'll do it.

59:43.077 --> 59:45.009
- A what?
- A jig.

59:45.044 --> 59:47.547
- Eli!
- All right, a jig's too far. A Charleston.

59:48.047 --> 59:50.014
- A Charleston?
- Yes, a Charleston.

59:50.049 --> 59:53.553
- A Charleston on the wing of the aeroplane.
- A Charleston's ridiculous.

59:53.588 --> 59:57.272
- Exactly.
- A Charleston is silly, Eli. Nobody will believe it.

59:57.307 --> 59:59.684
- I shall do it, and they will believe it.
- You'll get a laugh, Eli.

01:00:00.185 --> 01:00:04.314
Only when I want them to laugh. Right,
Lucky? A-one, two, three, four.

01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:06.781
A- one, two, three, four.

01:00:06.816 --> 01:00:09.319
A- one, two, three, four.

01:00:09.444 --> 01:00:11.946
A- one, two, three, four.

01:01:00.203 --> 01:01:02.205
Plane! Cue the plane!

01:01:16.719 --> 01:01:19.722
Get in! Go on!

01:01:23.226 --> 01:01:25.693
Come on!

01:01:25.728 --> 01:01:27.605
Move your bloody ass!

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:34.112
Go! Go, go!

01:01:36.614 --> 01:01:40.618
Fly this bastard!
Hurry!

01:01:51.754 --> 01:01:55.258
Follow him up!
Follow him up!

01:02:32.045 --> 01:02:34.172
Bombs away.

01:02:35.173 --> 01:02:37.675
And here's some bubble water for you.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.179
Ah-ha!
That's the real thing.

01:02:41.214 --> 01:02:43.646
Voila!

01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:45.683
Like the service?

01:02:55.318 --> 01:02:57.695
Whoopee! You want some?
Go ahead!

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.418
Hey, give me me bottle back.

01:03:05.453 --> 01:03:08.456
Come on. Hand it over.
I want it back.

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:14.337
- Hey, now-
- Mate, was it something I said or what?

01:03:14.372 --> 01:03:17.340
I wish you wouldn't go away mad.

01:03:19.843 --> 01:03:22.220
Whoo!

01:03:25.098 --> 01:03:30.478

Shit.

01:05:36.604 --> 01:05:39.607
Mmm.

01:05:50.118 --> 01:05:52.620
Oh. Oh, no.

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:54.622
Mmm.

01:05:56.124 --> 01:05:58.626
Oh.

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:02.630
Oh.

01:06:07.135 --> 01:06:09.137
That's twice for me today.

01:06:11.139 --> 01:06:13.641
Now and when I watched you
do your stunt.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:26.119
Oh!

01:06:26.154 --> 01:06:29.122
I set the alarm
in case we dozed off.

01:06:29.157 --> 01:06:32.911
I have to study
my scene for tomorrow.

01:06:32.946 --> 01:06:36.004
The old lady at the cemetery.

01:06:36.039 --> 01:06:38.541
It's brutal.

01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:41.544
Why'd they cast, uh, you as an old lady?

01:06:43.046 --> 01:06:46.049
Well, I start out as a young girl.

01:06:46.174 --> 01:06:49.552
I'm hiding this American flyer.
I'm Austrian.

01:06:49.587 --> 01:06:51.519
Will you turn off the clock?

01:06:51.554 --> 01:06:55.975
But finally he leaves me
with another little patriot in my belly.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:58.978
Why couldn't I double for both of you?

01:06:59.479 --> 01:07:01.940
I don't look half bad.
I could use the money.

01:07:01.975 --> 01:07:04.901
Honey, you'll ruin it.
Take it off.

01:07:11.908 --> 01:07:14.828
The clock's electric.
It'll ring forever.

01:07:14.863 --> 01:07:16.830
Eli might really go for this.

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:24.838
What is the matter with you?

01:07:24.873 --> 01:07:27.841
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

01:07:27.876 --> 01:07:29.843
Mmm.

01:07:35.348 --> 01:07:37.816
- What are you doing?
- See, that's Eli...

01:07:37.851 --> 01:07:40.854
yelling his head off for you
to work on your scene.

01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:43.356
And that's us saying,
"Up yours, Eli. "

01:07:43.857 --> 01:07:45.824
I like that.

01:07:45.859 --> 01:07:48.862
- Would you please leave?
- I wanna make love to you...

01:07:49.362 --> 01:07:51.329
while Eli's screaming his head off.

01:07:51.364 --> 01:07:55.285
No, I can't make love
with the clock ringing.

01:07:59.789 --> 01:08:01.791
I'll bet you can.

01:08:07.964 --> 01:08:09.632
You tell 'em, Eli!

01:08:11.384 --> 01:08:13.636
- Eli, what I-
- I've been thinking.

01:08:13.671 --> 01:08:16.031
Why don't you just let the kid go,
huh?

01:08:16.066 --> 01:08:18.390
Chuck keeps a perfectly
good eye on him.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.394
Eli, he's dangerous to have around.

01:08:21.429 --> 01:08:23.663
Now, stop playing games, huh?

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:25.899
Just tell Jake you replaced him.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.902
I don't understand you.
What are you so hooked on with him?

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:31.904
He helps me to understand
the young man in our story.

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:34.407
- That's bullshit, you know.
- True.

01:08:34.442 --> 01:08:37.125
- Eli, come on.
- Oh, Sam.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.662
You read in the newspaper of a land mine
left over from some war...

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:42.665
that from time to time goes off suddenly.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.631
He's like one of those.

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:47.670
You read of a boy in a tower who shoots
a dozen students for no reason at all.

01:08:47.705 --> 01:08:50.138
His mother says he was such a good son.

01:08:50.173 --> 01:08:53.676
- Probably I want to know what he really did.
- Who cares?

01:08:53.711 --> 01:08:55.678
- I care.
- Bullshit.

01:08:56.179 --> 01:08:57.680
- True.
- Eli, come on.

01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.682
Eli. Eli!

01:09:01.184 --> 01:09:03.651
- Hello, Sam.
- Hiya, Gabe.

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:07.023
Did you bring the tampaxes? Raymond's
acting like he's got the curse again.

01:09:07.058 --> 01:09:09.491
- Bullshit! Ow!
- Aah, god damn it!

01:09:09.526 --> 01:09:13.029
I don't suppose Raymond knows
how to drive a Duesenberg.

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:15.031
Eli, come on.

01:09:22.956 --> 01:09:25.959
Entry was good.
Roof's holding.

01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:29.462
Everything seems fine.

01:09:29.796 --> 01:09:32.263
Why did he try to run me down?

01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:34.801
He didn't even see you, he was so pumped
up to make a second run at the bridge.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:38.805
- Look at him struggle, huh?
- Badly.

01:09:38.971 --> 01:09:41.689
Eli won't use a foot of it.

01:09:41.724 --> 01:09:44.727
That poor son of a bitch died for nothing.

01:09:44.761 --> 01:09:47.729
See, uh, the crack in the windshield?

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:50.198
What about it?

01:09:50.233 --> 01:09:53.569
Probably from the impact.
That ain't hurtin' anything.

01:09:53.604 --> 01:09:55.738
There. Look at that.

01:09:57.824 --> 01:09:59.826
He's starting to panic.

01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:04.080
Will you, for Christ's sake,
tell me why?

01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:11.302
That's where it stops.

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:15.341
Fuckin' Henry got spooked and took
his finger off the remote button.

01:10:17.844 --> 01:10:23.349
Is that the way the, uh, story's supposed
to end, with the flyer dying in the water?

01:10:23.384 --> 01:10:26.352
Sure as shit ended that way for Burt,
didn't it?

01:10:26.387 --> 01:10:29.689
The car is parked over there.

01:10:29.724 --> 01:10:31.656
The graveyard is here.

01:10:31.691 --> 01:10:34.527
Lots of these little graveyards
along the roadside,

01:10:34.562 --> 01:10:36.630
and lots of little, little graves.

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:38.663
Most of the stones are unmarked.

01:10:38.698 --> 01:10:42.667
- Now, you're a tired girl.
- Tired.

01:10:42.702 --> 01:10:45.795
The rent of that car
is a month's pension.

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:48.833
You can't go searching anymore
for this bloody tombstone,

01:10:48.868 --> 01:10:51.342
so you pick one, any one,

01:10:51.377 --> 01:10:53.379
- Eli, uh-
- And put down the flowers.

01:10:53.838 --> 01:10:56.841
An idea, maybe, huh?

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:58.843
Oh! My knees.

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:02.388
Nina, bear with me.
I'm not the director.

01:11:02.423 --> 01:11:04.349
I'm just the writer.

01:11:04.384 --> 01:11:07.317
Eli, what if,

01:11:07.352 --> 01:11:09.819
instead of the flowers,

01:11:09.854 --> 01:11:13.358
What if she brought him
something more intimate?

01:11:13.393 --> 01:11:16.861
Something from their lives together,
huh?

01:11:16.896 --> 01:11:19.864
Of their sexuality.

01:11:21.241 --> 01:11:24.244
Like her nightgown.

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.746
Or her undies.

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:29.214
Huh?

01:11:29.249 --> 01:11:32.752
I know, I know,
they might be rags by now,

01:11:32.787 --> 01:11:36.221
but, Eli, you see this?

01:11:36.256 --> 01:11:39.259
- What is it?
- I know. Take a look at it over here.

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:42.762
- No, don't peek.
- Come on.

01:11:46.015 --> 01:11:49.018
Now, this is very authentic.

01:11:49.053 --> 01:11:51.486
Early Victorian.

01:11:51.521 --> 01:11:55.024
Mechanical bronzes used to be
quite a thing, you know.

01:12:02.532 --> 01:12:04.534
What do you think?

01:12:12.542 --> 01:12:15.044
You'll get a belly laugh, Sam.

01:12:15.545 --> 01:12:17.547
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

01:12:17.582 --> 01:12:19.514
They'll break their hearts over it.

01:12:19.549 --> 01:12:22.552
- No, there won't be a dry seat in the house.
- What, are you crazy?

01:12:22.587 --> 01:12:27.557
This is a work of genius here.
Frisky little bear, a work of-

01:12:27.592 --> 01:12:31.060
Son of a-
You did it again, you bastard!

01:12:31.561 --> 01:12:34.063
Ah, welcome to the same picture, Sam.

01:12:51.581 --> 01:12:54.959
Oh, you terrible bear.

01:12:54.994 --> 01:12:57.302
So impatient.

01:12:57.337 --> 01:12:59.839
Tearing something so beautiful.

01:12:59.874 --> 01:13:02.842
Signora. Signora.

01:13:02.967 --> 01:13:06.971
This is an unmarked grave.
Please, let me escort you to your car.

01:13:07.006 --> 01:13:09.474
No, when I'm gone you
will take everything away.

01:13:09.509 --> 01:13:11.441
- No.
- Yeah, you will.

01:13:11.476 --> 01:13:15.417
And I cannot stop you, and it is wrong.

01:13:15.452 --> 01:13:19.157
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm ridiculous, huh?

01:13:19.192 --> 01:13:22.827
But you laugh without knowing anything.

01:13:22.862 --> 01:13:26.366
You would buy a plastic
wreath for a man of such-

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:29.869
Please.

01:13:32.872 --> 01:13:34.839
From President Wilson.

01:13:34.874 --> 01:13:37.877
From the President
of the United States.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.883
For heroism... to me...

01:13:46.386 --> 01:13:47.887
for sheltering him.

01:13:48.388 --> 01:13:51.391
- Come on, Denise. Let's not get Eli mad.
- Hey, don't panic.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:53.066
He's got that big,
emotional scene to do

01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:56.396
with the dog food lady
before he even gets to you.

01:13:56.896 --> 01:13:59.649
Well, hello there, guys. Come on,
we got a set call in 40 minutes.

01:13:59.684 --> 01:14:02.402
You're all probably not even gonna
work until midnight. You wait.

01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:05.905
Eli will wave his wand and get it
out of her in five minutes.

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.908
Oh, no, you're confused.
He got it into her in five minutes.

01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:13.037
To get it out of her,
it takes longer.

01:14:13.072 --> 01:14:16.308
Uh-oh.
Somebody didn't know.

01:14:16.343 --> 01:14:19.509
Hey. Hey, Blondie.
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.544 --> 01:14:23.423
I didn't mean that. I'm a woman scorned.
I'd say anything.

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:27.927
- This is an unmarked grave.
- How silly.

01:14:27.962 --> 01:14:30.930
I sheltered him to be with him.

01:14:35.435 --> 01:14:38.187
He was my beloved.

01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:40.905
Signora, please.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.444
- Oh, god.
- Cut it.

01:14:48.948 --> 01:14:50.915
Ah, shit, Eli.

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:52.952
I could shoot myself.

01:14:55.455 --> 01:14:57.797
I know.

01:14:57.832 --> 01:15:00.335
Thank you, my baby.
Thank you.

01:15:13.765 --> 01:15:17.268
Giddyap there, soldier.
Last one there is on Medicare.

01:15:17.303 --> 01:15:19.771
Where are we rushing to?
I was asleep.

01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:21.738
Having trouble staying awake?

01:15:21.773 --> 01:15:25.276
Stick of gum would you care for?
Stick of gum makes you hum.

01:15:25.311 --> 01:15:28.745
- Do you read?
- Short words.

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:32.248
Schickel and Bergenstadt,
a couple of Dutch comedy writers.

01:15:32.283 --> 01:15:36.252
You see, it has pictures. But no
skimming now. Chuck will quiz you on it.

01:15:36.287 --> 01:15:40.291
If you pass, you win a free trip to Amsterdam
and you can stick your finger in a dike.

01:15:40.326 --> 01:15:41.522
What the hell is this?

01:15:41.548 --> 01:15:44.295
A pamphlet on how to
get out of a sunken car.

01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:46.798
In Holland, you see, they have a problem
with canals,

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:49.766
so these gentlemen are experts.

01:15:49.801 --> 01:15:53.304
- Did Burt read this?
- Offhand, I'd say no. Wouldn't you?

01:15:54.806 --> 01:15:57.809
- No chance.
- There you go, rejecting me yet again.

01:15:57.844 --> 01:16:00.812
Burt, you are not being reasonable.

01:16:03.314 --> 01:16:06.032
Gentlemen... and Jake.

01:16:06.067 --> 01:16:08.570
I have exactly two minutes
of borrowed time.

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:11.573
I'm in the middle of a scene.

01:16:12.073 --> 01:16:14.200
- You've met the chief of police, have you, Burt?
- Jake? Of course you-

01:16:14.235 --> 01:16:16.953
Turn over!

01:16:27.589 --> 01:16:30.592
This is Burt, the stunt man,
driving that car.

01:16:30.627 --> 01:16:33.595
The guy with me is Thompson
from the F.B.I.

01:16:37.557 --> 01:16:41.811
Jesus!
I don't see anybody else on the road.

01:16:41.846 --> 01:16:44.814
- Did you, Burt?
- Uh-uh.

01:16:46.816 --> 01:16:50.820
My buddy and I saw that fellow Cameron
break out of the woods and head that way,

01:16:50.855 --> 01:16:53.288
Down the road.

01:16:53.323 --> 01:16:56.040
I had a clear view.
I was on top of the pole.

01:16:56.075 --> 01:16:59.043
- Mr. Cross, do you mind if we look at this again?
- Help yourself, gentlemen.

01:16:59.078 --> 01:17:03.583
The room is yours, but waiting for me are 60
people who are being paid for doing nothing.

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:06.085
Burt, come on.
You have reading to do.

01:17:08.588 --> 01:17:12.592
Burt? It's amazing you're still alive,
considering who you're working for.

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.559
Come on, Burt.
We've time to kill you yet.

01:17:14.594 --> 01:17:17.597
- Did you see that-
- Yeah. Why don't we go ahead and run it one more time?

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:20.100
- Run it all day. I'm not going anyplace.
- All right.

01:17:24.104 --> 01:17:26.606
- Why are you lagging?
- What is wrong?

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:29.126
Trying to figure it out.
Where was I?

01:17:29.161 --> 01:17:32.388
How tall is King Kong?
Three foot-six?

01:17:32.423 --> 01:17:35.615
Good boy.
I have versions of all sorts.

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.617
Care to go back and see one?

01:17:38.118 --> 01:17:41.684
In one version, you fly the helicopter
and I'm driving the Duesenberg.

01:17:41.719 --> 01:17:45.250
It's a dilly. How 'bout the version
where I go over the bridge and drown?

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:48.218
What is this?
Why would I want to harm you?

01:17:48.253 --> 01:17:50.255
- You don't like my tattoo.
- I think it's beautiful.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.472
I think it heroic.

01:17:52.507 --> 01:17:56.476
I think it to be a major work which may
rank with Campbell's tomato soup can.

01:17:56.511 --> 01:18:01.516
Now, I have a picture to make. Will you
take that damn thing and will you read it?

01:18:04.519 --> 01:18:06.986
I knew a guy once.

01:18:07.021 --> 01:18:09.524
Stepped on a Bouncing Betty
booby trap.

01:18:10.024 --> 01:18:12.714
Steppin' on it wasn't the problem.

01:18:12.749 --> 01:18:15.405
It's when you step off it explodes.

01:18:16.906 --> 01:18:20.034
So all he could do
was just stand there.

01:18:26.166 --> 01:18:28.793
Holy shit!

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:33.923
Fire!

01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:48.313
Get him! Get him!

01:19:29.104 --> 01:19:31.106
Cut.

01:19:34.734 --> 01:19:39.204
Who said cut?
I had a film run-out.

01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:41.581
Get up. Come on back at it.

01:19:41.616 --> 01:19:45.495
How many feet of film are left
in that camera, Gabe?

01:19:48.498 --> 01:19:50.500
Thirty-three.

01:19:54.379 --> 01:19:58.883
Goddamn your fucking eyes.
How dare you yell cut on my set?

01:19:58.918 --> 01:20:01.886
What the hell, Eli.
Thirty-three feet is nothing.

01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:05.855
It is 22 seconds, Henry.

01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:08.858
In 22 seconds, I could
break your fucking spine!

01:20:08.893 --> 01:20:11.646
In 22 seconds, I could pinch
your head off like a fucking insect...

01:20:12.147 --> 01:20:14.149
and smear it all over
the fucking pavement.

01:20:14.649 --> 01:20:18.653
In 22 seconds, I could put 22 bullets
inside your ridiculous gut.

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:21.924
What I seem unable to do
in 22 seconds...

01:20:21.959 --> 01:20:25.125
is to keep you from fucking up...
my film!

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:29.212
I just can't tell you how pleased I was...

01:20:29.247 --> 01:20:33.251
when you congratulated me
after my scene this afternoon.

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:37.255
All the other glowing tributes
just faded to nothing.

01:20:39.757 --> 01:20:42.761
Nevertheless,

01:20:43.261 --> 01:20:46.765
I am canceling your invitation
to an intimate party,

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.268
given by my parents, to honor me...

01:20:50.769 --> 01:20:54.272
...on the occasion of my birthday.

01:20:56.274 --> 01:20:59.743
Oh, but don't feel too badly.

01:20:59.778 --> 01:21:03.747
As consolation
for a lovely evening missed,

01:21:03.782 --> 01:21:07.786
I am presenting you with
the good-sport-of-the-month award.

01:21:15.794 --> 01:21:18.797
Tsk, tsk.

01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:35.278
Mr. Baum.

01:21:35.313 --> 01:21:39.067
Would you please notify
this young savage...

01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:42.821
that it's customary
to cover one's privates...

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:45.288
when acceptin' an award?

01:21:45.323 --> 01:21:48.827
I mean, it's one
of the common courtesies,

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:51.830
Like congratulatin' people.

01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:56.334
What should I congratulate you for?

01:21:58.336 --> 01:22:01.339
For the fuckin' scene
or for fuckin' the director?

01:22:05.844 --> 01:22:08.847
For fucking the director... honey.

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:14.352
Didn't you know that's how little girls
get into the movies?

01:22:49.512 --> 01:22:52.981
My friend, taking my life in my hands,

01:22:53.016 --> 01:22:56.019
I must inform you
that you are an asshole.

01:22:59.522 --> 01:23:03.526
Being a devout masochist, it follows
that I am Eli's best friend,

01:23:05.028 --> 01:23:07.530
And I know quite a lot
about him and Nina.

01:23:08.031 --> 01:23:10.533
You and the whole fuckin' crew,
buddy.

01:23:14.037 --> 01:23:16.504
They met three years ago.

01:23:16.539 --> 01:23:19.507
Two lonely people
rattling around New York.

01:23:19.542 --> 01:23:23.511
A brutal winter.
Eli's marriage had just broken up.

01:23:23.546 --> 01:23:26.549
All she had to do was tell me!
That's all, just tell me!

01:23:28.051 --> 01:23:31.054
She could have done that
in four seconds, kid.

01:23:32.555 --> 01:23:36.809
They went to bed once.
They were lousy as lovers.

01:23:36.844 --> 01:23:41.456
But they had a problem.
They liked each other.

01:23:41.491 --> 01:23:46.069
They recognized an area
of mutual sensitivity.

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.536
I'm boring you.

01:23:48.571 --> 01:23:52.075
You telling me that he banged
her once three years ago?

01:23:54.077 --> 01:23:57.580
I'm gonna see if they can put me up
in the employee's toilet.

01:24:04.963 --> 01:24:08.466
He "banged her" twice
to confirm the awful truth.

01:24:10.468 --> 01:24:12.971
Was she supposed to be a virgin?

01:24:25.233 --> 01:24:27.235
Yeah.

01:24:28.736 --> 01:24:30.738
Yeah.

01:24:36.244 --> 01:24:39.712
I had a virgin once.

01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:42.750
Had to go to Guatemala for it.

01:24:43.251 --> 01:24:45.253
She was blind in one eye,

01:24:45.753 --> 01:24:48.256
and she had a stuffed
alligator that said,

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:50.759
"Welcome to Miami Beach."

but I was sort of invited to a birthday
party, and I can't seem to find it.

01:25:32.585 --> 01:25:34.552
And this seems to be a birthday party.

01:25:35.053 --> 01:25:38.556

Hey, Lucky. Guess who told 'em to take

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.657
- You quit?
- Fuckin' a.

01:26:30.692 --> 01:26:33.695
But not before splittin'
my Schlitz...

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:36.162
with the one guy, except me,

01:26:36.197 --> 01:26:38.665
who wouldn't take any shit
off that screwball.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:43.204
- Like me to take it out of this, sir?
- Change is yours, son.

01:26:43.239 --> 01:26:45.171
Except that.

01:26:45.206 --> 01:26:48.710
That's a very special dime.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:50.211
You know what that is?

01:26:50.712 --> 01:26:54.215
- Uh-
- It's Eli cross's ass.

01:26:56.217 --> 01:26:58.720
I mean, some guys think
'cause you're easygoing,

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.687
they can walk all over you.

01:27:00.722 --> 01:27:05.727
Bullshit. You kill a man and hide
from the police? Are you kiddin'?

01:27:06.227 --> 01:27:10.732
I'm blowin' the whistle
with this dime in that phone.

01:27:13.234 --> 01:27:16.703
Who does he think he is?

01:27:16.738 --> 01:27:19.490
Hey. What the hell you doing?

01:27:19.525 --> 01:27:22.243
Hey, Lucky, what are you doin'?

01:27:22.278 --> 01:27:24.210
Come on.

01:27:24.245 --> 01:27:26.247
Watch it! That damned maniac
tried to strangle me.

01:27:26.282 --> 01:27:28.767
You don't believe me.

01:27:28.802 --> 01:27:31.217
Want to see marks?

01:27:31.252 --> 01:27:33.755
I'm lucky to be alive.
I saw the whole damn thing today.

01:27:34.255 --> 01:27:36.925
He never even touched you.
You're drunk. Don't drive.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.427
Come on, Henry.
It's okay. Come on.

01:27:39.462 --> 01:27:41.429
Look, not today.

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.397
When Burt went in the water.

01:27:44.432 --> 01:27:47.936
I could see from up there in the chopper
something was wrong,

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:49.903
So I stopped shootin'.

01:27:49.938 --> 01:27:54.442
This crazy man gets me by the throat
and starts hollerin' to roll the film.

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:57.946
I mean, there's a man
down there dyin',

01:27:58.446 --> 01:28:01.950
and he's screamin',
"Keep shootin'! Keep shootin'!"

01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:05.453
He starts fightin' me for the switch.

01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:07.455
It falls down.

01:28:09.457 --> 01:28:11.960
It's like a crazy house up there.

01:28:13.962 --> 01:28:16.965
And him thrashing around
on the floor.

01:28:18.925 --> 01:28:20.927
He didn't care about Burt.

01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:26.433
All he cared about was gettin'
that dying man on film.

01:28:27.976 --> 01:28:29.936
Oh, shit.

01:28:31.438 --> 01:28:33.440
I better get that cab.

01:28:51.833 --> 01:28:54.335
- You all right back there?
- Happy as clams.

01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:56.803
She's so beautiful.

01:28:56.838 --> 01:28:59.340
Isn't it exciting? I mean, the way
they put the whole thing together.

01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:02.343
- What have you got next for me, A.J.?
- Scenes 122 to 126, Eli.

01:29:02.844 --> 01:29:05.847
Sam should see some of this.
We left a line or two of his dialogue in.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.349
All right.

01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:11.853
- Rolling.
- Speed. Quiet! Quiet!

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:14.821
- Hold it down.
- Jesus Christ.

01:29:14.856 --> 01:29:18.324
- How did this slip in?
- Scene 150, take 1.

01:29:18.359 --> 01:29:22.363
I'll go stop it, Eli.
It will make things worse.

01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:25.331
Hold on. Wet them down.

01:29:25.366 --> 01:29:27.368
Makeup, wet 'em down.
Sweat.

01:29:27.403 --> 01:29:29.871
Oh!
Sweat.

01:29:32.373 --> 01:29:33.875
Ready? Okay, go ahead.
Hold it, hold it.

01:29:34.375 --> 01:29:35.877
Okay, go ahead.

01:29:36.377 --> 01:29:38.344
Ohh, jeez.

01:29:38.379 --> 01:29:40.882
And... action!
I'm stopping it, Eli.

01:29:41.382 --> 01:29:43.510
It really will make things
marginally worse.

01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:45.512
Shut up.

01:29:53.645 --> 01:29:55.862
Save it. Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Hold it, Nina.

01:29:55.897 --> 01:29:59.400
- Eli, I don't know what's wrong with me.
- Nina, it's the shame.

01:29:59.435 --> 01:30:02.368
- I know!
- A bloody shame, woman.

01:30:02.403 --> 01:30:04.871
You've lost your son.
You've lost your father.

01:30:04.906 --> 01:30:08.409
You want to tear that man's throat out,
but you don't.

01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:11.913
You stay there meekly, and you burn
with the bloody shame of it.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:14.415
I know, I know. Maybe it's them.
I feel like I'm in-

01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:16.883
- Who?
- My parents. I feel like I'm in a zoo.

01:30:16.918 --> 01:30:19.921
Let me say bye and get them on their way.
Maybe it might be okay.

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:22.764
Oh, there's one thing
you should know.

01:30:22.799 --> 01:30:25.642
It's not important.
It's completely unimportant.

01:30:25.677 --> 01:30:28.867
- There was a screw-up in the dailies.
- What dailies?

01:30:28.902 --> 01:30:32.058
Well, the attic scene,
the bare-assed attic scene?

01:30:32.559 --> 01:30:35.562
That was shown in dailies. I don't know
how it got there and I couldn't stop it.

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:38.332
But your parents-

01:30:38.367 --> 01:30:41.067
Now... shame.

01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:46.072
Roll film.

01:31:15.101 --> 01:31:20.572
Sieg! Sieg!
Heil! Heil!

01:31:20.607 --> 01:31:23.693
"Open all windows slowly
to keep pressure...

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:26.196
...but this? From caving in the roof. "

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:28.948
For Eli to trick them like that?

01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:33.452
Why would he do it?

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.955
He's not an evil man.

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:40.960
You're right.
He's not an evil man.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:43.463
He's a crazy man.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.930
What?

01:31:45.965 --> 01:31:49.969
"The water pressure at 200 feet
can crush a man to the size of an egg."

01:31:52.472 --> 01:31:55.440
He wants that on film.

01:31:55.475 --> 01:31:58.728
Hmm.
So he's gonna kill me.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:01.981
What are you babbling about?

01:32:02.482 --> 01:32:05.610
It's a rotten shame about your folks
and your naked ass,

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:08.613
but dying always scared me a little,
okay?

01:32:09.114 --> 01:32:11.081
You're beginning to scare me.

01:32:11.116 --> 01:32:14.619
Eli almost strangled a man because he
stopped the camera when Burt got killed.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.747
You take the word of some
malcontent technician?

01:32:18.248 --> 01:32:19.714
I saw the bruises!

01:32:19.749 --> 01:32:23.253
And I saw Eli that night when he told
Burt's brother on the phone.

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.095
I saw the tears.

01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:28.633
It doesn't change the fact
that the man is crazy.

01:32:30.885 --> 01:32:35.014
If he had his way, there wouldn't be
a soldier left alive by morning.

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:38.518
But I'm the only soldier
he's got on hand.

01:32:42.522 --> 01:32:46.526
I don't even know if he knows
why he's doing it, but it's a great idea.

01:32:48.027 --> 01:32:50.842
I mean, a genuine dumb grunt...

01:32:50.877 --> 01:32:53.658
cashing in before your very eyes.

01:32:54.159 --> 01:32:55.785
The real McCoy.

01:32:56.286 --> 01:32:58.851
Kill two birds with one stone.

01:32:58.886 --> 01:33:01.416
It's got nice logic to it.

01:33:02.792 --> 01:33:06.296
- The problem is, both birds are me.
- Stop it.

01:33:07.797 --> 01:33:10.049
I'd die if anything happened to you.

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:12.267
It's my father.

01:33:12.302 --> 01:33:15.930
I won't talk to him. You're all
driving me crazy. I won't talk to him!

01:33:16.431 --> 01:33:19.934
Tell him I'm not here.
Tell him I'm at work. Hello.

01:33:20.435 --> 01:33:21.936
Yeah, uh-

01:33:24.439 --> 01:33:27.442
Sure, Chuck.
I'll meet you in an hour.

01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:37.417
For me.

01:33:37.452 --> 01:33:39.829
Amazing how people
keep secrets around here.

01:33:52.967 --> 01:33:55.470
What if I said I wasn't gonna do
the stunt?

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:57.472
I'd say fine.

01:33:59.974 --> 01:34:02.977
What if I said I was
gonna leave tonight...

01:34:04.979 --> 01:34:07.947
and I wanted you to come with me?

01:34:07.982 --> 01:34:10.485
But we have one more day
of shooting.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.379
What if I can't wait?

01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:14.239
I have two more scenes.

01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:16.241
That's a shame.

01:34:18.743 --> 01:34:20.745
I can meet you.

01:34:26.251 --> 01:34:30.220
Look, don't do the stunt.

01:34:30.255 --> 01:34:33.723
You think Eli's a killer,
then you just call the police.

01:34:33.758 --> 01:34:36.761
I mean, that is all I need right now
after what I've been through,

01:34:37.262 --> 01:34:40.265
for you to give me now-or-never ultimatums
and tell me my director's insane.

01:34:42.267 --> 01:34:44.234
Will you look at this mother?

01:34:44.269 --> 01:34:47.272
I'll bet those guys could build
a quarter horse out of a jackass.

01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:50.775
Why not? You built
a stunt man out of one.

01:34:51.276 --> 01:34:52.777
A stunt man?

01:34:53.278 --> 01:34:55.780
Three days, and you've already grown
those big brass balls.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:58.248
Jump up and down so I can hear 'em clank.

01:34:58.283 --> 01:35:01.751
Then do me a favor-
Leave them at home for this gag.

01:35:01.786 --> 01:35:06.291
There's just enough room in this car
for a normal guy who thinks.

01:35:12.922 --> 01:35:15.925
All right. Show me how long
you can hold your breath.

01:35:18.928 --> 01:35:21.431
Now, look around.
What do you see?

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:23.433
No roll bar.

01:35:23.933 --> 01:35:26.436
That's because the roof caving in
really looks gassy on film.

01:35:26.936 --> 01:35:29.939
Your protection is in the back of the seat.
It's steel sheeting.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.942
You listening to me?
You got good lungs.

01:35:34.819 --> 01:35:38.538
There's no shoulder harness
'cause it'd show on film.

01:35:38.573 --> 01:35:41.576
So when the car hits the water, you brace
yourself against the steering wheel.

01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:46.080
It's reinforced. You couldn't
break it loose with dynamite.

01:35:47.332 --> 01:35:49.799
You gettin' lightheaded yet?

01:35:49.834 --> 01:35:53.338
All right, keep your hands off the doors.
You're leaving through the window.

01:35:53.838 --> 01:35:57.342
You lower them slowly as you sink
to equalize the pressure.

01:35:59.344 --> 01:36:02.847
What are you waitin' on? I'm not
gonna be down there holding your hand.

01:36:02.882 --> 01:36:05.315
Slower.

01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:07.317
When the car hits the bottom,

01:36:07.352 --> 01:36:09.854
the windows are gonna be open,
and you're gonna make like a minnow.

01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:12.822
But first, a little fresh air
wouldn't hurt.

01:36:12.857 --> 01:36:17.362
You reach under the seat, and
what do you know? A regulator.

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:19.829
Don't worry.
There'll be one there tomorrow.

01:36:19.864 --> 01:36:23.118
You keep your face forward. The camera's
behind you, and it's still running.

01:36:23.493 --> 01:36:26.996
When the water gets above your nose,
you gotta look like you're drowning.

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:31.466
- Burt wasn't too good at that.
- He convinced me.

01:36:31.501 --> 01:36:35.547
Raymond's a very good actor, but, darling,
the next time you take out the nutcrackers,

01:36:35.582 --> 01:36:38.515
be a little humane, make sure
the poor man has one to spare.

01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:41.052
What do you expect me to do, take him
into the back room and unzip his fly...

01:36:41.087 --> 01:36:43.019
every time he flubs a line?

01:36:43.054 --> 01:36:47.058
- What else can I do for your movie, Eli?
- Everything's on my back!

01:36:47.559 --> 01:36:49.185
When does someone say,
"There, there, Eli"?

01:36:49.686 --> 01:36:52.689
Which of my many friends and allies?
I'm surrounded by them.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:56.693
And you- "What else can I do
for your film, Eli?"

01:36:58.695 --> 01:37:01.162
That's not fair.
That's not fair!

01:37:01.197 --> 01:37:05.702
What's not fair? Having hurt feelings?
That's not fair?

01:37:06.703 --> 01:37:08.670
I lost you, Nina,

01:37:08.705 --> 01:37:11.708
to that swell, wholesome,
fine-looking kid,

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:15.176
that soldier boy...

01:37:15.211 --> 01:37:19.215
wanted by every policeman,
F.B.I. man, sheriff,

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.182
probably the American army...

01:37:21.217 --> 01:37:24.220
and possibly the Vietcong
for god knows what crime!

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.187
Jesus Christ, woman.

01:37:26.222 --> 01:37:29.726
- Can you not see the man? He's reeking with blood.
- You're crazy-

01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:33.730
- You sound just as crazy-
- As crazy as who?

01:37:37.233 --> 01:37:40.236
He says...
that you're trying...

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:42.238
to harm him.

01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:47.243
Any number of people
are trying to harm him.

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:09.015
- How'd you know I was down here?
- The desk clerk.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:12.268
Hey, how 'bout that for luck, huh?

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.235
Burt's from New York.

01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:17.273
There's no picture on the license.

01:38:31.287 --> 01:38:33.539
Who are you?

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.792
Name it.

01:38:37.293 --> 01:38:39.671
Who the hell are you?

01:38:44.676 --> 01:38:48.019
Somebody trying to stay alive.

01:38:48.054 --> 01:38:51.307
Anybody who can get through the dogs
and the quicksand.

01:38:53.309 --> 01:38:56.312
Who'd Eli say I was?

01:38:56.813 --> 01:38:59.315
Jack the Ripper?

01:39:01.317 --> 01:39:05.286
- Why do they want you?
- Eli'd tell you.

01:39:05.321 --> 01:39:08.825
I did the same as everybody else,
just one of the boys.

01:39:10.326 --> 01:39:12.829
I shot my M-16 at every sound.

01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:17.834
Of course, I didn't know if I was killing
gooks or cherries.

01:39:20.336 --> 01:39:23.339
New kids from the States,
we called them cherries,

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:26.843
which they were for maybe 15 minutes.

01:39:26.878 --> 01:39:29.363
So after the war, I went home.

01:39:29.398 --> 01:39:31.848
I guess I expected something.

01:39:31.883 --> 01:39:34.816
Free car wash,

01:39:34.851 --> 01:39:37.353
double blue chip stamps.

01:39:37.854 --> 01:39:41.322
Instead, uh, they looked at me...

01:39:41.357 --> 01:39:45.361
like I was gonna start
killing babies or something.

01:39:46.863 --> 01:39:50.366
I was supposed to get married,

01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:53.369
Run an ice cream parlor.

01:40:02.879 --> 01:40:04.881
I gotta go.

01:40:06.382 --> 01:40:10.887
Um, wh- What about the roadblocks?

01:40:10.922 --> 01:40:12.889
I'll go through the woods.

01:40:13.389 --> 01:40:16.893
Well, don't you suppose
there'll be cops in the woods?

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:19.896
What the hell?
It's a nice night.

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.868
I love the woods at night.

01:40:26.903 --> 01:40:30.907
It might be such fun
that we'd just keep going.

01:40:37.413 --> 01:40:40.417
You said "we."

01:40:40.917 --> 01:40:43.420
What about your two scenes?

01:40:45.422 --> 01:40:47.424
That's right. You're right.

01:40:47.459 --> 01:40:50.392
One of them is, uh,

01:40:50.427 --> 01:40:53.930
three pages of me
making tuna fish salad...

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:55.897
for an American flyer in 1917.

01:40:55.932 --> 01:40:58.935
And I have to weigh that
against losing the man I love.

01:41:01.938 --> 01:41:03.940
It's a big decision.

01:41:04.441 --> 01:41:06.943
Don't make me crazy, Nina.

01:41:08.945 --> 01:41:12.449
I'm sorry.
I'm a little crazy myself.

01:41:16.453 --> 01:41:18.455
I won't lose you.

01:41:22.959 --> 01:41:25.462
And I don't even know
who you are.

01:41:28.965 --> 01:41:32.469
Why are they after you?
What did you do?

01:41:32.504 --> 01:41:35.472
What happens to me in the woods?

01:41:37.474 --> 01:41:39.350
Am I gonna need a bayonet too?

01:41:42.353 --> 01:41:45.857
The charge was, uh, attempted murder.

01:41:48.359 --> 01:41:50.361
I bashed this cop's head in.

01:41:52.363 --> 01:41:54.616
Caught me breaking in to a store.

01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:56.618
No.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.122
Not to rob it, no.

01:42:04.626 --> 01:42:07.629
No, I was there to kill
the guy who owned it.

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:09.971
Oh, why?

01:42:10.006 --> 01:42:13.760
Because it seemed like a good idea
to twist his head off!

01:42:15.762 --> 01:42:20.231
He said I'd be his partner
when I came back.

01:42:20.266 --> 01:42:23.770
The lyin' son of a bitch was real sorry
things were slack.

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:29.275
Slack, my ass!

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:35.281
He just didn't want me hangin' around
'cause he was bangin' my old lady.

01:42:35.532 --> 01:42:38.535
So I went down to his store and started
bangin' on his door!

01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:40.502
I'm bangin' on his door!

01:42:40.537 --> 01:42:44.165
It's 2:00 in the morning.
That son of a bitch isn't open. Open up!

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.876
Oh, your hand!

01:42:47.419 --> 01:42:50.880
Maybe he's screwing her
behind the counter.

01:42:50.915 --> 01:42:53.800
Huh?

01:42:53.883 --> 01:42:56.803
You behind the counter,
you bastard?

01:43:00.306 --> 01:43:03.684
You know what was behind that counter?

01:43:03.719 --> 01:43:07.063
Forty-one different flavors
of ice cream.

01:43:09.566 --> 01:43:11.818
And all that fuckin' syrup!

01:43:12.902 --> 01:43:16.121
And those Mickey Mouse-

01:43:16.156 --> 01:43:18.158
Mickey Mouse faces on the wall!

01:43:20.326 --> 01:43:24.330
I grabbed this hot fudge pot and I went
runnin' across the goddamn room!

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:27.834
Here you are, you motherfuckers!
Smashed it-

01:43:31.337 --> 01:43:33.923
Right into that shelf full of animals.

01:43:34.424 --> 01:43:39.429
It started raining pussycats and monkeys
and kangaroo cookies just like Noah's ark.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:43.433
"How long should a girl wait?"
She says.

01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:47.704
How long?
For-goddamn-ever, bitch!

01:43:47.739 --> 01:43:51.906
That's how long!
That's how long!

01:43:51.941 --> 01:43:56.362
I picked up this vat of ice cream,
flavor of the month-

01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:58.830
Royal Bavarian chocolate mist-

01:43:58.865 --> 01:44:02.368
And I started running
with that son of a bitch!

01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:18.885
Scoop this up your royal
Bavarian strawberry snatch!

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.887
Aah!

01:44:23.389 --> 01:44:26.392
- It's not funny.
- Oh, baby.

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:28.812
Aah!

01:44:30.313 --> 01:44:32.781
Come on. C-

01:44:32.816 --> 01:44:35.318
Come here.

01:44:45.829 --> 01:44:47.796
We gotta get organized.

01:44:47.831 --> 01:44:50.750
No, wait. Let me get up.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:53.468
I'm gonna have an accident.

01:44:53.503 --> 01:44:56.506
Let me go to the bathroom.

01:44:57.006 --> 01:44:59.509
No, you'll miss the main part.

01:45:00.009 --> 01:45:02.553
Killer Cameron's ghastly crime.

01:45:02.588 --> 01:45:05.063
See, I was freaked out of my head,

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:10.103
and there was this flashlight
that started shining me in the face.

01:45:10.138 --> 01:45:13.106
So I grabbed this ice cream bucket
and I slopped it...

01:45:13.606 --> 01:45:16.276
right on that guy's head.

01:45:16.359 --> 01:45:18.361
That's not funny, baby.

01:45:20.363 --> 01:45:23.366
No, it wasn't him.
It was a cop.

01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:26.835
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:29.337
I didn't know he was knocked out,
so I got out of there.

01:45:29.372 --> 01:45:33.376
How the hell did I know he was gonna lay
there all night with his head in ice cream?

01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:36.344
- Oh, my God. He died?
- No.

01:45:36.379 --> 01:45:39.848
- No, he went to a hospital.
- Oh, no.

01:45:39.883 --> 01:45:43.887
Yeah. You see,
that ice cream is goddamn cold.

01:45:43.922 --> 01:45:48.391
His, uh, tip of his nose,
it froze.

01:45:48.426 --> 01:45:50.894
And his earlobe froze.

01:45:52.896 --> 01:45:55.648
It was terrible.

01:45:55.899 --> 01:45:59.784
No, it's not funny.
His ear froze.

01:45:59.819 --> 01:46:03.323
His nose froze, and his tip
of his ear froze off.

01:46:03.358 --> 01:46:05.790
- No!
- Yes!

01:46:05.825 --> 01:46:08.328
And his earlobe-
I gotta go!

01:46:08.363 --> 01:46:11.296
Listen.
It's not funny.

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:15.835
It's a bad year to be messing with cops.

01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:17.802
Oh, no!
It's too late!

01:46:17.837 --> 01:46:21.841
- You get the F.B.I. down on your ass.
- Thanks a lot.

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:28.348
Hey.

01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:33.853
If we woke up Eli,

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:38.858
if we woke him up and told him
about the ice cream,

01:46:42.862 --> 01:46:46.866
do you think he'd forgive me,
call off the stunt?

01:47:05.635 --> 01:47:09.139
How do you open this damn thing?

01:47:09.174 --> 01:47:12.142
Sorry, folks. It's locked.

01:47:12.177 --> 01:47:15.860
Yeah, well, we know.

01:47:15.895 --> 01:47:18.898
- Can you open it for us?
- Can't.

01:47:18.933 --> 01:47:21.866
Not till 7:00.
Mr. Cross's orders.

01:47:21.901 --> 01:47:25.370
Oh, I'm sure Mr. Cross will understand...

01:47:25.405 --> 01:47:29.409
when you tell him that Miss Franklin
had a sudden desire for Swedish pancakes,

01:47:29.909 --> 01:47:32.912
and this gentleman had a sudden desire
to keep me company.

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:35.880
Pancake house don't open till 8:00.

01:47:35.915 --> 01:47:38.883
Well, that's all right.
We'll find another place.

01:47:38.918 --> 01:47:42.422
- Well, y'all'd never make it through the roadblocks.
- Why not?

01:47:42.457 --> 01:47:44.889
Mr. Cross don't want anybody
to leave tonight.

01:47:44.924 --> 01:47:48.928
Guess he wants everybody to be good
and rested for the last day.

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:52.932
No secret that the chief's
hoping this is the last day.

01:47:54.434 --> 01:47:56.901
Are you telling me...

01:47:56.936 --> 01:48:00.440
that if I decide to take a drive at any time
of the day or night or whenever I damn please,

01:48:00.475 --> 01:48:02.442
I have to have Mr. Cross's permission?

01:48:02.942 --> 01:48:07.697
Mr. Cross does not control me, and he
certainly does not control the public roads.

01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:10.575
No, but the police do.

01:48:11.075 --> 01:48:14.078
I could wake up Mr. Cross
if you want me to, but, uh-

01:48:14.329 --> 01:48:16.331
- No, that's okay.
- Okay. If you change your mind,

01:48:16.366 --> 01:48:19.834
- ... I'll be around.
- Sure.

01:48:20.335 --> 01:48:24.964
I can't believe it. That son of a bitch
knows whatever I'm thinking.

01:48:25.965 --> 01:48:28.968
I'm beginning to feel like-

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:32.472
Like something Sam wrote.

01:48:32.507 --> 01:48:34.939
I'm not real.

01:48:34.974 --> 01:48:38.978
I'm some jerk American flyer
from World War I...

01:48:39.479 --> 01:48:43.107
who's got to
go off a bridge and die...

01:48:43.142 --> 01:48:46.691
because some goddamn script says so.

01:48:46.726 --> 01:48:50.240
If they just tore out that page,

01:48:51.741 --> 01:48:54.744
just ripped it out, you know, I'd-

01:48:57.247 --> 01:48:59.249
I'd be fine.

01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:06.256
If they crossed it out
and-and wrote something else,

01:49:06.291 --> 01:49:08.258
like, uh,

01:49:09.759 --> 01:49:11.761
"At the last moment,

01:49:13.263 --> 01:49:16.266
"he veers the big car
from the railing...

01:49:17.767 --> 01:49:20.770
and goes speeding off
to live happily ever after."

01:49:34.284 --> 01:49:36.286
Hey.

01:49:39.789 --> 01:49:41.291
How 'bout that?

01:49:43.293 --> 01:49:45.295
Huh?

01:49:46.796 --> 01:49:49.764
Empty road.

01:49:49.799 --> 01:49:51.801
Me out there all alone.

01:49:53.803 --> 01:49:56.306
The crew, they're,
uh, they're way back.

01:49:56.341 --> 01:49:59.274
They're b-breathless...

01:49:59.309 --> 01:50:01.311
as I, uh, approach the bridge.

01:50:03.313 --> 01:50:07.817
And then, uh, then, "Hey!
Hey, what happened?"

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:13.323
A fucking rewrite's what happened!

01:50:19.829 --> 01:50:22.832
I can have 15 minutes on 'em before
they even know they're shootin'...

01:50:22.867 --> 01:50:26.336
- ... a whole goddamn new version!
- Yes!

01:50:26.371 --> 01:50:29.304
Yes!

01:50:29.339 --> 01:50:31.841
The love story.
What about the love story?

01:50:31.876 --> 01:50:33.808
What happens to the Austrian girl?

01:50:33.843 --> 01:50:37.847
People will leave the theater feeling
awful, unless she goes with him.

01:50:37.882 --> 01:50:41.851
How?
Oh, baby, how?

01:50:41.886 --> 01:50:43.853
Well.

01:50:46.856 --> 01:50:48.358
Here. In here.

01:50:48.858 --> 01:50:51.798
Right in here.

01:50:51.833 --> 01:50:54.704
See?

01:50:54.739 --> 01:50:57.207
Yeah. Uh, not bad.

01:50:57.242 --> 01:51:00.710
It's just that, you know, I think
they made arrangements to meet later.

01:51:00.745 --> 01:51:02.997
- Like in a bus station.
- No, see how big it is? And it's comfortable too.

01:51:03.498 --> 01:51:06.591
Nina, get out of the trunk.

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:09.879
- Hey, Charlie.
- Nina. Somebody's coming.

01:51:09.914 --> 01:51:13.133
I ain't doin' nothing till they-

01:51:13.168 --> 01:51:15.135
Nina!

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:41.995
Keep the cars moving up there!

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:48.001
Come on, boys!
Keep 'em moving!

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:52.005
Hey, Whitey, what film you working on?
Stay with us.

01:51:59.512 --> 01:52:03.016
How about over here?
Other side of the bridge.

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:16.494
Hey, I think it's a circus.

01:52:16.529 --> 01:52:19.532
All right, people.
The rest period is over.

01:52:20.033 --> 01:52:22.660
Another 15 minutes,
and we start losing the light.

01:52:23.161 --> 01:52:24.662
Boys, go to work.

01:52:25.163 --> 01:52:27.130
Where do you want the Duesenberg?

01:52:27.165 --> 01:52:30.981
- Let's get the porta-pits off the trucks.
- Don't just stand around here.

01:52:31.016 --> 01:52:34.798
Start unloading. We're gonna run out
of light here in about three hours.

01:52:34.833 --> 01:52:37.265
Let's get 'em all unloaded.

01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:40.303
Walt, we need your divers out of the
limo. Get 'em into their wet suits.

01:52:40.804 --> 01:52:43.932
- Come on, let's get that equipment off those trucks.
- Okay, boys, let's go to work.

01:52:44.432 --> 01:52:49.521
Driver captain, take all your drivers
out of the truck.

01:52:49.556 --> 01:52:51.915
I need those reflectors
up on this hill.

01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:54.275
Come on, let's go.
Get 'em rolling, boys.

01:52:58.279 --> 01:52:59.906
Get your rifle.
Take your position.

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:02.999
Are these things loaded or what?

01:53:03.034 --> 01:53:05.412
Head 'em up, move 'em out, boys.
Let's get 'em rolling. Hyah!

01:53:05.447 --> 01:53:07.664
Everything behind the bridge.

01:53:07.699 --> 01:53:09.631
Come on! Hyah!

01:53:09.666 --> 01:53:13.044
Come on. Good. Mark it right there.
Harry.

01:53:13.079 --> 01:53:15.512
Fifty pounds there, front and back.

01:53:15.547 --> 01:53:19.426
Air bottle goes right there. Red light
right up above so he can see it good.

01:53:19.926 --> 01:53:23.019
Warren, are you there?

01:53:23.054 --> 01:53:24.771
There's only one battery
in there.

01:53:24.806 --> 01:53:29.150
- You got the tape?
- Jack, the camera goes on the right-hand side.

01:53:29.185 --> 01:53:32.188
I don't want it to fly in the back of
the guy's head. Make sure it's down tight.

01:53:32.689 --> 01:53:35.191
Make sure he can see the light.
Put it right in front of his eye sight.

01:53:35.692 --> 01:53:38.159
Oh, great.
We're in good shape.

01:53:38.194 --> 01:53:40.161
Let's check it one more time
before we go.

01:53:40.196 --> 01:53:43.074
Make sure you wipe it clean so it
looks nice and pretty. Come on, guys.

01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:45.952
Lem, stay home at night,
and you'll be able to push.

01:53:45.987 --> 01:53:47.919
Get down there and get out of sight.

01:53:47.954 --> 01:53:50.394
- What about earphones?
- Just watch your mark.

01:53:50.429 --> 01:53:52.834
Mr. Cross, camera crew
is ready for a setup.

01:53:52.869 --> 01:53:55.336
Where's the chopper?

01:53:56.838 --> 01:53:59.305
This is the crooked cross
to the lame duck.

01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.808
If you can find us, we would care
for you to join us.

01:54:01.843 --> 01:54:04.846
Ten minutes, Eli.
We're just warming her up. Over.

01:54:07.849 --> 01:54:09.816
All right, everybody.

01:54:09.851 --> 01:54:14.355
May I have your 100 percent
concentration and attention, please?

01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:16.823
Everybody drop what you're doing,
stand still...

01:54:16.858 --> 01:54:19.861
and put your attention up here
to the director, please.

01:54:21.362 --> 01:54:23.329
That bizarre object over there...

01:54:23.364 --> 01:54:26.833
is the one and only Duesenberg
we have in stock.

01:54:26.868 --> 01:54:30.872
When it goes into the river, hopefully
we shall not see its like again.

01:54:30.907 --> 01:54:35.376
So, once the action starts,
no matter what happens,

01:54:36.127 --> 01:54:38.595
keep film rolling.

01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:40.632
We must have this shot.

01:54:41.132 --> 01:54:44.726
I, therefore, order
that no camera shall jam...

01:54:44.761 --> 01:54:48.139
...and no cloud pass before the sun.

01:54:49.641 --> 01:54:52.143
I can't do anything
without Raymond's wig.

01:54:54.646 --> 01:54:58.149
Hello, soldier boy. Where'd you learn
to live without sleep?

01:55:27.429 --> 01:55:29.431
How you doin', Burt?

01:55:29.931 --> 01:55:33.435
Hey, how the hell do you guys get
accident insurance?

01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:36.403
It must cost you an arm and a leg.

01:55:36.438 --> 01:55:38.940
That's a good one, huh?
Arm and a leg.

01:55:38.975 --> 01:55:41.443
Have a good day, all right?

01:55:43.945 --> 01:55:46.948
Bring up another 50 feet
of cable, plug it in.

01:55:49.451 --> 01:55:54.581
Looking real strong, kid. Is that loose
change jingling or are they beginning to grow?

01:55:54.616 --> 01:55:57.584
- Wanna check?
- Come look at this truck.

01:55:59.461 --> 01:56:00.962
The only reason
I'm telling you this,

01:56:01.463 --> 01:56:04.466
I don't want you to flip out into space
when you see these guys.

01:56:04.966 --> 01:56:08.470
They're supposed to be shooting at you, and
that's what makes you go off into the river.

01:56:10.472 --> 01:56:13.224
Hey, you ever get those pancakes?

01:56:13.259 --> 01:56:15.942
Hey!
They're my boys.

01:56:15.977 --> 01:56:18.980
You can't recognize them, right?
How could I say no to them?

01:56:19.481 --> 01:56:22.484
After all the crap they've taken from
your company in the last six weeks.

01:56:22.519 --> 01:56:24.986
A cop'll do anything for 50 bucks,
even work as an actor.

01:56:25.487 --> 01:56:29.491
These guns are kinda modern
for World War I.

01:56:29.526 --> 01:56:31.242
Those, uh-
Those better be blanks.

01:56:31.743 --> 01:56:34.370
It don't say so on the box.

01:56:43.546 --> 01:56:45.548
No need to look.

01:56:46.049 --> 01:56:48.016
There's really no need.

01:56:48.051 --> 01:56:51.519
If she loves you,
she's still there.

01:56:51.554 --> 01:56:55.558
If she doesn't, then it really
doesn't matter anyway, does it?

01:56:55.593 --> 01:56:57.525
Good luck.

01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:59.562
We need you, Lucky.

01:57:04.567 --> 01:57:06.069
Get in, will ya?

01:57:09.072 --> 01:57:12.575
Look straight ahead. Can you see the
red light out of the corner of your eye?

01:57:12.610 --> 01:57:15.668
That'll let you know
when the film's running,

01:57:15.703 --> 01:57:18.706
so be sure you don't turn
your face to the camera.

01:57:18.741 --> 01:57:20.959
Bump it once.

01:57:21.459 --> 01:57:23.961
Does it work?
Bump it again.

01:57:23.996 --> 01:57:26.429
- Camera on?
- Huh? What?

01:57:26.464 --> 01:57:28.932
Ask him if it's on.
Camera on?

01:57:28.967 --> 01:57:32.595
- Huh?
- He says, is the camera on?

01:57:34.889 --> 01:57:37.517
What the hell?

01:57:37.642 --> 01:57:40.019
Hey, what-

01:57:42.397 --> 01:57:45.275
- Hey, what-
- Crazy bastard!

01:57:45.775 --> 01:57:47.242
- Who cued him?
- Not me.

01:57:47.277 --> 01:57:50.029
What's he doing?
It's too soon.

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:51.996
Roll film. Roll film!

01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:55.535
Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:58.663
Move your asses!
I want this shot!

01:57:59.164 --> 01:58:01.631
No, not yet, you asshole!

01:58:01.666 --> 01:58:04.731
For God's sake,
swing that crane!

01:58:04.766 --> 01:58:07.797
- Get to your markers!
- Speed.

01:58:17.265 --> 01:58:20.268
Hang on, baby!

01:58:20.303 --> 01:58:23.271
We're home free!

01:58:23.306 --> 01:58:25.774
You okay?

01:58:27.776 --> 01:58:31.654
Shoot this, Eli!

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:49.923
Nina!

01:58:59.808 --> 01:59:01.810
Nina!

01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:05.438
Nina! No!

01:59:05.939 --> 01:59:07.440
Nina!

01:59:13.071 --> 01:59:16.074
Nina!

02:01:31.459 --> 02:01:34.462
There he is!
On the beach!

02:01:53.064 --> 02:01:56.067
Get him!

02:02:07.495 --> 02:02:09.497
All right. Cut!

02:02:09.532 --> 02:02:11.965
All right.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.502
Goddamn, my wife always says
it's dangerous being a policeman.

02:02:14.537 --> 02:02:17.505
You guys are sensational.

02:02:20.008 --> 02:02:22.343
- A really good job.
- All right. Come on.

02:02:22.844 --> 02:02:24.846
Get the stuff on the truck.

02:02:28.516 --> 02:02:31.352
Grab the stuff.
Let's go, boys.

02:03:13.311 --> 02:03:15.814
- You son of a bitch.
- Take a swig of this.

02:03:15.849 --> 02:03:17.816
Come on.
Don't be stingy.

02:03:23.571 --> 02:03:27.075
They've been there all the time?

02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:30.543
- Huh?
- Them.

02:03:30.578 --> 02:03:33.581
- Been there all the time.
- Can't hear you.

02:03:33.616 --> 02:03:36.000
They're clanking too loud.

02:03:37.752 --> 02:03:40.004
All right.

02:03:42.006 --> 02:03:44.474
Whoa!

02:03:44.509 --> 02:03:46.761
I can't come any further.
What should I do?

02:03:46.928 --> 02:03:49.764
I'll get the dress all muddy,
and I need it for the next scene.

02:03:50.265 --> 02:03:52.767
Tuna fish salad.
I know.

02:03:53.017 --> 02:03:55.985
They-

02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:00.024
They found me five minutes after you left.
I felt ridiculous.

02:04:00.059 --> 02:04:02.026
It's okay. It's okay.

02:04:02.527 --> 02:04:06.614
Then Eli told me you changed your mind
and decided to do the stunt.

02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:10.702
At first I didn't believe him,
but I guess you really did, didn't you?

02:04:13.455 --> 02:04:16.791
I'm so glad you two made up.

02:04:16.826 --> 02:04:19.294
Boy, Lucky,

02:04:19.794 --> 02:04:21.296
were you wonderful.

02:04:26.551 --> 02:04:29.303
I guess I'd better go.

02:04:29.338 --> 02:04:32.056
I'll see you after.

02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:38.062
I'm sorry I was so nutty last night.

02:04:38.563 --> 02:04:42.066
I always get crazy
at the end of a film.

02:05:11.721 --> 02:05:14.849
Lover boy, I think your circulation's
back to normal.

02:05:16.476 --> 02:05:19.229
Next time, do me a favor
and wait for the cue.

02:05:19.264 --> 02:05:21.731
The word is "Action."

02:05:33.576 --> 02:05:35.412
How.

02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:39.339
I've always had a great compassion
for your people.

02:05:39.374 --> 02:05:43.878
Long before it was popular to do so,
I felt a repugnance for General Custer.

02:05:43.913 --> 02:05:46.846
Oh, God.
I don't believe it's breathing.

02:05:46.881 --> 02:05:49.349
There's some days in which
I can't do one thing right.

02:05:49.384 --> 02:05:51.886
I hope this doesn't fuck up our
relationship, you being alive and all.

02:05:52.387 --> 02:05:54.389
Why didn't you just
let me go last night?

02:05:54.889 --> 02:05:57.892
With Nina in the trunk,
and I have scenes to shoot with her?

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.984
Okay, this morning.

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:03.585
- Chuck could've done that stunt.
- Mmm.

02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:07.152
I know a man who made an antiwar movie.

02:06:07.187 --> 02:06:09.119
A good one.

02:06:09.154 --> 02:06:13.658
When it was shown in his hometown,
army enlistment went up 600 percent.

02:06:14.159 --> 02:06:16.661
I'm trying to convince the world,
with my movie,

02:06:16.786 --> 02:06:20.790
there is a reasonable and better way
of getting home for Thanksgiving.

02:06:20.825 --> 02:06:24.561
And I'm unable to convince
one young, tattooed dummy.

02:06:24.596 --> 02:06:28.298
- Dummy?
- I couldn't let you go through life bananas,

02:06:28.798 --> 02:06:31.301
paranoid, thinking I
was trying to kill you.

02:06:31.336 --> 02:06:33.178
- Could I?
- Paranoid?

02:06:33.678 --> 02:06:37.522
Sam. Your screenplay has
just become relevant again.

02:06:37.557 --> 02:06:41.060
- The young man has named the disease.
- Yeah? What is it?

02:06:41.095 --> 02:06:42.812
It's a social disease, quite common.

02:06:43.313 --> 02:06:46.566
- Like crabs, the clap, or what?
- Close.

02:06:46.601 --> 02:06:49.711
It's got from screwing your fellow man.

02:06:49.746 --> 02:06:52.822
Well, I hope you find a, uh,
easier cure,

02:06:53.323 --> 02:06:56.826
because that was the hardest
thousand dollars I ever made.

02:07:00.955 --> 02:07:03.708
- Hello, sexy.
- Burt, that was fantastic!

02:07:04.209 --> 02:07:08.338
- You guys want a ride back?
- May I offer you gentlemen a lift in the chopper?

02:07:08.373 --> 02:07:10.305
Think I'll ride with Jake.

02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:13.343
- It's a lot safer.
- Probably right.

02:07:30.735 --> 02:07:33.238
A thousand dollars?
What thousand dollars?

02:07:33.273 --> 02:07:35.240
For the stunt.

02:07:35.490 --> 02:07:37.492
Stunt pays 650.

02:07:39.494 --> 02:07:43.060
No, Chuck said the stunt
paid a thousand dollars.

02:07:43.095 --> 02:07:46.626
Chuck could have promised you
the Nobel prize.

02:07:46.661 --> 02:07:49.594
The stunt pays 650.

02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:52.597
The stunt pays a thousand dollars.

02:07:52.632 --> 02:07:56.136
Chuck told me.
You're insulting me again.

02:07:57.137 --> 02:07:59.104
Diddems.

02:07:59.139 --> 02:08:01.141
Diddems, my ass!

02:08:02.892 --> 02:08:05.395
Split the difference.
Call it 750.

02:08:05.645 --> 02:08:08.648
You always want to split the difference.
That's your fuckin' problem, Eli!

02:08:11.025 --> 02:08:15.029
Split 'em with all these other fuckin'
morons, not with me! I want a thousand dollars.

02:08:15.155 --> 02:08:17.622
Sam, I cannot convince one man.

02:08:17.657 --> 02:08:20.785
You're cheatin' me. You look at me
like I'm some kind of goddamn movie.

02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:24.003
Well, I'm not!
I'm real, and I almost died!

02:08:24.038 --> 02:08:27.542
- And I want a thousand dollars for it!
- Be lucky.

02:08:27.577 --> 02:08:30.545
And you're gonna pay me
my thousand dollars!

02:08:30.795 --> 02:08:33.798
Come back here!
Don't you take off, you god-

02:08:37.802 --> 02:08:40.305
You son of a bitch!

02:08:40.805 --> 02:08:42.307
You bastard!
You convinced me!

02:08:42.807 --> 02:08:44.809
Try not to miss the aeroplane, Burt.

02:08:45.059 --> 02:08:48.027
He'd better not, Eli,
and I'm serious.

02:08:48.062 --> 02:08:50.475
If I find any of your
men within city limits

02:08:50.501 --> 02:08:52.592
tonight, I'm gonna
shoot 'em on sight.

02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:57.072
I'll be on that goddamn plane!

02:09:02.077 --> 02:09:05.080
Hey, come on back here,
you motherfucker!

02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:07.082
Come here!

02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:12.712
Come on in a little closer!

02:09:17.217 --> 02:09:21.721
I'm gettin' sick of being
somebody's goddamn clown!

02:09:22.222 --> 02:09:24.189
How tall is King Kong?

02:09:24.224 --> 02:09:28.228
Three foot-six, and that's what you're gonna
be if you don't pay me my thousand dollars!

02:09:31.231 --> 02:09:34.234
Give me my money!
Pink smoke!

02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:37.612
Come on over here
with your pink fuckin' smoke!

02:09:37.647 --> 02:09:41.032
Do try and not miss the plane, Burt.

02:09:41.533 --> 02:09:43.034
Clown!

02:10:23.074 --> 02:10:25.076
Sam, rewrite the opening reel!

02:10:25.577 --> 02:10:28.079
Crush the little bastard
in the first act!
