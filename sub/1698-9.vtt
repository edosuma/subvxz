Stay home just be by myself

why i'm on strings?

19:00.104 --> 19:02.404

girl so why am i a puppet?

19:02.707 --> 19:05.036
fine,i'll go thru it again

19:05.420 --> 19:10.450
now while you maybe a super girl,you're
forced to be what other people expect you
to be

19:10.651 --> 19:12.298
you are a puppet on a string,

19:12.337 --> 19:15.665
and until you break free,you will
never be in control of your own life

19:15.986 --> 19:16.882
duh!

19:19.424 --> 19:22.611
well shouldn't there be a part
where i break free?like now?

19:23.001 --> 19:24.984
mmmh uh,no!

19:26.198 --> 19:29.222
come on, I've always had
some say in my own routines.

19:29.291 --> 19:31.798
yeah,you know what i say to that?
step back girl

19:32.818 --> 19:35.126

- oh really?how about now?

19:36.353 --> 19:39.652

- ok,how about this?

19:42.118 --> 19:42.893
Real mature!

19:43.120 --> 19:46.270
But wasn't this the kind of give
and take you were looking for?

19:47.009 --> 19:48.633

19:48.922 --> 19:53.295

but it's time that someone say no no Nahnah!

19:53.571 --> 19:58.156

best friend but he would be the first one
to tell me that i don't have to put up
with...

20:01.108 --> 20:02.670
oh good,you're thru

20:04.112 --> 20:08.965

dance then i might as well just be a puppet
on a string...

20:12.607 --> 20:15.406

but since i can't

20:15.629 --> 20:17.480

hadn't wooded up the windows!

20:45.354 --> 20:49.152

20:49.294 --> 20:52.043

20:52.402 --> 20:56.512
