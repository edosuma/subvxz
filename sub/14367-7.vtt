Hi, Mrs. Z.

Hello, Mrs. Z.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.187
{\an1}Ginger.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.980
Hi, Mrs. Zorski.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.649
{\an8}So? Did you decide
between poems yet?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.735
{\an7}Will it be "Girl 13"
or "Sibling from Mars"?

01:08.818 --> 01:12.030
{\an7}The Arts Fair
is rapidly approaching

01:12.113 --> 01:15.241
{\an7}and I promised a Foutley
original in the flyer.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.534
{\an8}I know, but I was
kind of thinking

01:16.618 --> 01:19.204
{\an8}about writing a new piece.

01:19.287 --> 01:22.332
{\an7}Really? You been feeling
inspired lately?

01:22.415 --> 01:22.874
{\an8}Uh, not exactly.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.376
{\an8}But I may be on the brink

01:25.460 --> 01:26.795
{\an8}of some creative breakthrough.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.005
{\an7}I know
just what you mean.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.674
{\an7}I was thinking that I should
probably be featured

01:31.758 --> 01:32.967
{\an8}in the Arts Fair, too.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.803
{\an8}No question
about that.

01:34.886 --> 01:35.720
{\an8}No question.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.514
{\an7}Did I mention
that the school

01:37.597 --> 01:39.849
{\an7}is still desperately
in need of ushers?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.769
You get to carry a flashlight.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.355
Think about it.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.315
{\an1}And work on that poem,
Ginger.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.399
See you tomorrow.

Friday of freedom,

{\an1}Carl, watch
what you're doing.

You are standing

{\an1}The boy cannot be held
responsible for his actions

02:29.774 --> 02:32.068
if you fail to
turn his parcel over

02:32.151 --> 02:34.112
in the next three,
two, one.

02:34.195 --> 02:34.571
{\an1}Here...

02:34.654 --> 02:36.573
You are so young.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.575
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

02:38.658 --> 02:40.785
All right! Wow!

02:40.869 --> 02:41.161
Ha, ha!

02:46.583 --> 02:48.960
Hey, Darren.

02:49.043 --> 02:49.711
Hey. What's happening?

02:49.794 --> 02:52.547
{\an1}Uh, got a letter
from Dad.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.299
Seriously?
What did he say?

02:54.382 --> 02:55.675
I didn't open it.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.677
For the best.
Want me to trash it?

02:57.760 --> 02:58.761
{\an1}I didn't open it <i> yet,</i>
Darren.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.722
But I am going to open it.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.600
He's my dad, okay?

03:03.683 --> 03:06.477
{\an1}Okay. Yeah. So what
do you think he wants?

03:06.561 --> 03:10.356
I don't know, but...
we're about to find out.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.442
Cool... when?

03:12.525 --> 03:13.776
Now.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.736
Right now.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.280

03:17.363 --> 03:20.867

03:20.950 --> 03:25.788
"Stir briskly and refrigerate
anywhere from four to six hours.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.876
This ensures proper incubation."

03:29.959 --> 03:32.128
Hoodsey:
Let's go for six hours, Carl.

03:32.211 --> 03:32.629
Just to play it safe.

03:32.712 --> 03:37.634
(<i> laughing</i> )

03:37.717 --> 03:41.137
Soon, Hoodsey,
our snake will be mature.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.140
And then we can teach it
to kill!

03:44.223 --> 03:45.308
(<i> laughs</i> )

03:45.391 --> 03:48.311
Hoodsey:
This is the best day of my life.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.981
Our snake is going to rule
School Pet Day tomorrow!

03:52.065 --> 03:56.486
{\an4}But, Carl, Brandon Higsby
is bringing in his older
brother's pet monkey.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.823
{\an5}Believe you me, Hoodsey,
our snake will devour
that hand-me-down monkey!

04:00.907 --> 04:02.575
(<i> laughs</i> )

04:02.659 --> 04:04.035
Carl, come in!

04:04.118 --> 04:06.037
I do not read you!

04:11.084 --> 04:14.712
"Dear Ginger, congratulations
on your graduation."

04:14.796 --> 04:16.505
{\an1}(<i> scoffs</i> )
Yeah!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.423
{\an1}Graduation was only,
like, last June.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.844
But that's cool.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.429
{\an1}Go on.

04:23.513 --> 04:28.267
"I'm sorry that I haven't been
around a whole lot in the past

04:28.351 --> 04:31.354
but I would like to be
in the future."

04:31.437 --> 04:32.188
{\an1}Great.
But you have to admit

04:32.271 --> 04:34.482
{\an1}the man's got a funny
way of showing it.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.650
Darren...

04:35.733 --> 04:37.777
I'm serious.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.404
{\an1}Remember when you
begged your mom

04:39.487 --> 04:40.113
{\an1}to invite him
to Thanksgiving

04:40.196 --> 04:42.657
{\an1}'cause he said
he wanted to come?

04:42.740 --> 04:45.284
Then she finally caved in
and said yes, and then...

04:45.368 --> 04:47.745
{\an5}Both:
He had to cancel
because something came up.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.373
So what's your point?

04:50.456 --> 04:54.711
{\an1}My point is...
is that it's great.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.005
Really great.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.090
I just hope, you know...

04:59.173 --> 04:59.716
nothing comes up.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.926
(<i> sighs</i> )

05:02.010 --> 05:03.052
This time he left
a number.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.805
And the card
is pretty cute.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.224
Kids? I'm home.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.520
Whoa, I'm parched.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.481
Got to lay off
those salt bagels.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.985
Hey, I thought
we were out of lemonade?

05:20.319 --> 05:21.904
(<i> sniffs</i> )

05:21.988 --> 05:24.741
(<i> gulping</i> )

05:24.824 --> 05:26.034
Ah...

05:26.117 --> 05:26.743
Do you want me to stay?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.911
For moral support?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.329
Mmm, nah.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.165
I think I better
do this alone.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.833
{\an1}If you chicken out
and hang up

05:33.916 --> 05:35.084
{\an1}and then the phone
rings again right away

05:35.168 --> 05:37.462
{\an1}make sure
you don't answer it.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.381
{\an1}In case he uses that instant
call-back thing on you.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.008
Okay, thanks.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.218
{\an1}But if it rings twice,
then stops

05:44.302 --> 05:46.596
{\an1}and then starts ringing again,
it's me calling.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.805
So pick up.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.766
Okay, Darren.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.975
{\an3}Thanks.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.393
Wish me luck.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.853
Luck.

05:56.522 --> 05:56.856
Hi, Dad.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.357
This is Ginger.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.402
Hi, Dad.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.404
I'm calling because
I got your letter.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.290
Hi, Dad, I was just looking
at a picture of your... leg

06:14.373 --> 06:17.293
and so I thought I'd call.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.003
Oh...

06:29.013 --> 06:30.389
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

06:30.473 --> 06:33.142
Jonas on answering machine:
Oh. Are we recording?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.310
Is it on? Whoops.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.520
Okay, hi! It's Jonas.

06:35.603 --> 06:35.978
(<i> dog barking</i> )

06:36.062 --> 06:37.772
Speak at the beep

06:37.855 --> 06:39.190
and I'll get back to you.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.483
No, not you, Ben.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.152
Maybe this is a bad idea.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.657
Carl:
No...!

06:47.740 --> 06:48.699
What's going on?

06:48.783 --> 06:49.659
Did something bad happen?

06:49.742 --> 06:53.329
{\an5}That may be
the understatement
of the century.

06:53.412 --> 06:57.291
My plans for Pet Day tomorrow
are completely ruined!

06:57.375 --> 06:58.584
I got nothing!

06:58.668 --> 07:01.254
Oh, no? Why not bring in
your Mutant Snake Mother?

07:01.337 --> 07:01.712
That'll amuse the crowd.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.047
It will not!

07:03.131 --> 07:05.675
{\an1}Thanks for
your concern, Carl.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.176
{\an1}I'm the one
who's incubating

07:07.260 --> 07:08.803
{\an1}an invertebrate
over here.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.097
What are you two
talking about?

07:11.180 --> 07:13.808
Mom drank my snake!

07:13.891 --> 07:15.351
He left it in the fridge.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.728
{\an1}In a lemonade pitcher
of all things.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.355
But... Mom...

07:19.438 --> 07:21.858
Didn't it taste bad?

07:21.941 --> 07:22.817
{\an1}Actually, it was
a lot better

07:22.900 --> 07:25.695
{\an1}than the stuff we usually
have from concentrate.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.279
Oh, great!

07:26.362 --> 07:29.574
{\an1}I'm glad
you enjoyed it!

07:29.657 --> 07:33.369
Mom, maybe we should call
their 800 number just in case.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.454
(<i> stomach gurgles,</i>
<i>groaning</i> )

07:35.538 --> 07:37.123
Probably not a bad idea.

07:37.206 --> 07:42.753
Can you <i> please</i> ask them to
overnight me a replacement?

07:42.837 --> 07:45.173
{\an1}The answer is no,
and from this point on

07:45.256 --> 07:47.717
all animals requiring
incubation of any kind

07:47.800 --> 07:50.303
are officially banned
from this household.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.471
Oh...!

07:52.555 --> 07:53.890
(<i> dialing</i> )

07:53.973 --> 07:56.058
(<i> ringing</i> )

07:56.142 --> 07:57.768
It's ringing.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.854
Oh, hi, my name is Lois Foutley?

07:59.937 --> 08:02.565
I accidentally
ingested your snake product

08:02.648 --> 08:04.025
which my son
stupidly left

08:04.108 --> 08:05.902
{\an1}in a lemonade pitcher
in our fridge

08:05.985 --> 08:07.486
thinking no one
would drink it.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.864
Now, I have a very
delicate constitution

08:09.947 --> 08:12.742
and I'm already starting
to feel a little queasy

08:12.825 --> 08:14.660
so my question to you is this...

08:15.828 --> 08:18.206
Sure, I'll hold.

08:18.289 --> 08:22.919
Poem for the Arts Fair,
poem for the Arts Fair.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.088
Lights out, Ging.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.424
It's really late.

08:28.507 --> 08:31.093
I got a letter from Dad today.

08:31.177 --> 08:31.928
Oh?

08:32.010 --> 08:33.596
For my graduation.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.307
Oh.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.102
Well, better late
than never, right?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.772
I think he has
a dog named Ben.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.690
Makes sense.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.608
{\an1}He always related
to animals.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.777
{\an1}When we first started
dating, he had a pet...

08:47.860 --> 08:51.030
Ferret, I know.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.991
So what do you think
I should do?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.286
I mean,
should I call him?

08:59.914 --> 09:02.124
{\an1}Well, kiddo, this may be
the snake talking

09:02.208 --> 09:04.293
{\an1}but I think you should
follow your heart.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.837
{\an1}He may be a little flaky,
but he's your father.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.172
And he's not a bad guy.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.800
{\an1}At some point, you kids
are going to have to decide

09:10.883 --> 09:12.468
{\an1}what role he plays
in your lives.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.345
Yeah and just
because he wasn't

09:14.428 --> 09:16.180
all that reliable
in the past

09:16.264 --> 09:17.682
well, that doesn't mean

09:17.765 --> 09:20.184
he's always going
to be that way, right?

09:20.268 --> 09:21.269
I mean, people change.

09:21.352 --> 09:25.690
{\an1}Well...
sometimes they do.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.483
Now get some shut-eye.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.423
(<i> stomach gurgling</i> )

09:50.506 --> 09:52.675
Sheesh! Must be hungrier
than I realized.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.261
Huh?

09:55.344 --> 09:59.015
{\an5}Lois, maybe we
should lay off the
creme caramel, hmm?

10:00.558 --> 10:03.060

(<i> hissing</i> )

10:05.187 --> 10:06.689
(<i> people screaming...</i> )

10:09.525 --> 10:11.694
Lois, it's 7:15.

10:11.777 --> 10:11.986
Wake up.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.904
What?

10:13.988 --> 10:16.157
(<i> hissing</i> ):
It's 7:15!

10:16.240 --> 10:17.074
Time to wake up!

10:17.158 --> 10:20.036
(<i> hissing</i> )

10:20.119 --> 10:22.872
Announcer:
It's 7:15, all you sleepy heads.

10:22.955 --> 10:23.205
Time to wake up!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.749
(<i> gasps</i> )

10:24.832 --> 10:26.667
(<i> panting</i> )

10:26.751 --> 10:28.586
(<i> stomach gurgling</i> )

10:28.669 --> 10:32.965
Oh, another night of lost sleep,
courtesy of Carl.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.719
(<i> barking, chirping</i>
<i>and tweeting...</i> )

10:39.055 --> 10:41.932
What an adorable little monkey!

10:42.016 --> 10:44.685
{\an1}He likes to swing, and jump,
and play "got your nose"

10:44.769 --> 10:49.315
{\an1}and his most favorite food
in the whole wide world is...

10:49.398 --> 10:51.942
{\an1}Let me guess, Brandon--
bananas!

10:52.026 --> 10:52.943
Correct!

10:53.027 --> 10:55.488
Both:
No! Duh!

10:55.571 --> 10:57.323
{\an1}Some people think he's
the smartest monkey

10:57.406 --> 11:00.242
{\an1}in the whole wide world,
but me...

11:00.326 --> 11:03.079
I think he's the cutest.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.830
(<i> blows kiss</i> )

11:04.914 --> 11:06.332
He blew a kiss!

11:06.415 --> 11:08.834
The monkey
blew a kiss!

11:08.918 --> 11:12.338
Did you see that,
boys and girls?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.590
(<i> kids muttering</i> )

11:14.673 --> 11:18.677
Well, this has been
an exciting day indeed.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.262
All the ballots are in

11:20.346 --> 11:23.307
so I'll just scootle out into
the hall and tally them up.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.394
Back in a flash with the winner.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.896
{\an1}Though it hardly
seems necessary...

11:28.979 --> 11:30.272
(<i> kids muttering</i> )

11:30.356 --> 11:33.859
{\an1}(<i> imitating monkey</i> ):
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:35.986 --> 11:36.362
(<i> chattering</i> )

11:36.445 --> 11:40.908
He wants to share.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.034
Ha!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.955
(<i> chattering</i> )

11:46.038 --> 11:48.082
{\an1}You can't
break him, Carl.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.876
He's just a good,
good monkey boy.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.461
{\an1}(<i> growls</i> )

11:52.545 --> 11:54.171
(<i> whimpers</i> )

11:58.175 --> 11:59.093
You did what?!

11:59.176 --> 12:02.888
I called and invited
my dad to the Arts Fair...

12:02.972 --> 12:04.014
to hear my poem.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.266
I can't believe it.

12:05.349 --> 12:05.933
So what did he say?

12:06.016 --> 12:08.561
Shh!

12:08.644 --> 12:11.105
{\an5}(<i> whispers</i> ):
Well, I didn't exactly
speak to him.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.189
I left the details
on his voice mail.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.316
But he'll be there.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.317
Mom and Carl will
be really surprised.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.862
I was thinking
the whole family

12:17.945 --> 12:18.988
{\an5}could go out
for ice cream
afterwards!

12:19.071 --> 12:21.740
{\an1}Librarian:
Shh!

12:21.824 --> 12:24.743
{\an5}(<i> whispers</i> ):
Who know what that
ice cream could lead to?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.746
I mean, the family might
get back together one day

12:27.830 --> 12:30.166
like on that TV show.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.002
(<i> yells</i> ):
I won't tell you girls again!

12:35.504 --> 12:37.756
{\an1}So did you finish
your poem?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.133
That's it!

12:39.216 --> 12:41.093
The three noisemakers!
Out!

12:41.177 --> 12:43.971
(<i> girls laugh</i> )

12:44.054 --> 12:45.598
Let's get out of here.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.682
(<i> laughing</i> )

12:46.765 --> 12:47.057
(<i> monkey screeching</i> )

12:47.141 --> 12:49.643
Ow! I'm down!

12:49.727 --> 12:50.603
He, he bit me!

12:50.686 --> 12:53.731
What happened here?
What happened?

12:53.814 --> 12:54.190
The monkey bit Carl!

12:54.273 --> 12:56.233
He broke the skin!

12:56.317 --> 12:57.485
I saw everything!

12:57.568 --> 13:00.237
Brandon? Is this true?

13:00.321 --> 13:03.991
{\an1}I-I... I've never seen him
act like that before.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.826
He was provoked!

13:05.910 --> 13:07.244
Oh, it burns!

13:07.328 --> 13:09.914
It burns!

13:09.997 --> 13:11.123
{\an5}Somebody! Call an ambulance!

13:11.207 --> 13:13.751
Hang in there, Carl.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.294
Help is on the way.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.837
Aah...!

13:16.921 --> 13:20.424
(<i> hooting and chattering</i> )

13:20.508 --> 13:21.550
(<i> screeching</i> )

13:21.634 --> 13:25.888
{\an1}He's turning into
a monkey! Look!

13:25.971 --> 13:28.557
Higsby! You're
staring at a lawsuit

13:28.641 --> 13:30.643
the size of Texas,
cowboy!

13:30.726 --> 13:32.019
(<i> screeching</i> )

13:32.102 --> 13:33.062
(<i> soap opera music</i>
<i>playing on TV</i> )

13:33.145 --> 13:35.022
I'm sorry.

13:35.105 --> 13:35.940
I feel so silly.

13:36.023 --> 13:36.607
{\an1}Please, Lois,
not at all.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.109
So... let's get
this straight.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.277
After you drank the...

13:40.361 --> 13:41.946
Dehydrated Sea Snake.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.739
Right, the Dehydrated Sea Snake

13:43.822 --> 13:46.742
you called the manufacturer
right away, correct?

13:46.825 --> 13:48.160
Maybe an hour
passed, tops.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.412
But I told you, they
said it was no different

13:50.496 --> 13:51.413
than going out
for a shrimp dinner.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.124
Ah, it's silly,
I should just...

13:54.208 --> 13:55.417
Now, hold on, hold on.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.045
Let's just take a peek
at that tummy of yours.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.505
Simple ultrasound okay?

13:59.588 --> 14:01.340
Okay.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.010
Hmm...

14:05.094 --> 14:06.595
What hmm?

14:06.679 --> 14:10.599
{\an1}Well, I see a little
motion in there.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.101
Might just be gas.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.269
Probably.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.104
We had burritos
last night.

14:15.187 --> 14:15.437
Mine was Grande.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.773
Grande, hmm?

14:17.856 --> 14:19.692
You don't say.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.653
Still, Lois, I think it's best
you stay overnight

14:22.736 --> 14:23.070
for... observation.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.114
Oh, I can't.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.533
{\an5}My kid's in
a production
at school.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.702
{\an1}Look, Mom,
it's probably nothing.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.746
{\an1}But we going to have to
keep you, just to be sure.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.289
Doctor's orders, okay?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.290
Case closed.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.292
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:36.375 --> 14:38.085
Dr. Dave? We need
you in emergency.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.044
A little boy got
bit by a monkey

14:39.128 --> 14:42.506
and is exhibiting some
really strange behavior.

14:42.590 --> 14:42.881
{\an1}Let's go.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.259
He wouldn't...

14:45.342 --> 14:47.011
It couldn't be...

14:47.094 --> 14:50.180
Nah...

14:54.018 --> 14:55.102
Hmm...

14:55.185 --> 14:55.477
Ginger? Sweetie?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.479
Your mom called.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.732
{\an1}She's staying over
at the hospital tonight.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.483
{\an1}She said
nothing to worry about.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.319
She's going to call you later.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.153
Don't freak.
My mom said

15:04.236 --> 15:06.697
{\an1}they just want to
keep her for one night

15:06.780 --> 15:08.449
{\an1}to watch
for sea snake growth.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.744
{\an1}So I guess me and Carl
are staying alone tonight.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.120
{\an1}Nope, they're keeping
Carl, too.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.331
What?!

15:15.414 --> 15:19.043
{\an1}Something about being bit
by a monkey at school.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.586
Oh, give me a break.

15:20.669 --> 15:20.961
Start me off?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.092
{\an1}So you're going to crash
at our house tonight.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.677
My mom made up the guest bed.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.845
Great.

15:29.928 --> 15:30.929
Well, I know I'm not

15:31.013 --> 15:31.388
Courtney Gripling but...

15:31.472 --> 15:33.807
I'm sorry, Darren.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.102
It's just that... my dad
is coming to the show tonight

15:37.186 --> 15:39.605
and I wanted Mom and Carl
to be there.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.399
Kind of like a surprise
reunion or something.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.567
Your dad's coming?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.986
{\an1}I mean, he's,
he's actually coming?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.738
Yes, Darren.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.698
He is, okay?

15:50.616 --> 15:51.825
I really can't work

15:51.909 --> 15:54.828
with you looking over
my shoulder, Darren.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.330
{\an1}(<i> irritated</i> ):
Sorry...

15:56.413 --> 15:58.415
I mean, sorry.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.584
Want the rest
of my apple?

16:00.668 --> 16:01.627
No, thank you.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.462
{\an1}Okay.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.966
Uh, I guess I'll see you
at the Arts Fair tonight.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.051
Bye.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.054
Bye.

16:22.856 --> 16:26.235
(<i> hooting</i> )

16:26.318 --> 16:27.861
Do you think
he's rabid?

16:27.945 --> 16:28.987
Not clinically.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.326
That's the kind
of beha...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.078
Eww.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.497
{\an1}Sorry about this, uh,
monkey business.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.749
(<i> stomach gurgles</i> )

16:40.833 --> 16:42.584
Oh, pardon...

16:42.668 --> 16:44.920
{\an1}I got to go see a man
about a snake!

16:45.003 --> 16:46.213
(<i> groaning</i> )

16:49.341 --> 16:51.885
Carl!

16:51.969 --> 16:53.762
{\an5}JoAnn:
Now, don't get
too close.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.100
He looks diseased.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.852
That's how
he always looks.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.019
{\an1}I know you can't
hear me, Carl

17:01.103 --> 17:05.398
but you're my best friend
in the whole wide world.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.901
{\an1}And if anything
ever happened to you

17:07.984 --> 17:11.405
{\an1}I'd spaz really hard,
and I'm not just saying that.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.531
Brandon feels really bad.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.825
Everyone does.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.492
{\an1}He sent these bananas
for you

17:16.577 --> 17:18.287
{\an1}but I'm sure
you don't want them.

17:18.369 --> 17:21.457
(<i> chattering</i> )

17:21.540 --> 17:22.624
Look, Mom,
he wants them!

17:22.708 --> 17:25.042
{\an1}Now, let a nurse
bring them in.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.045
You cannot afford another
sick day, Robert Joseph.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.593
No, no, it has to be sunflowers.

17:32.676 --> 17:33.552
They're her favorite.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.305
Two dozen, if you can.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.807
Okay, are you sure
they can be there in time?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.100
Lois? Sorry
to interrupt

17:40.184 --> 17:41.643
but Monkey Boy
wants to know

17:41.727 --> 17:43.812
{\an5}if you're going
to finish your
banana bread.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.189
{\an1}Yeah, sure,
he can have it.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.816
{\an1}Now, would you mind reading
that card back to me?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.109
Oh, sure thing.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.154
It says "Ginger,
I'm proud of who you are.

17:52.237 --> 17:52.404
All my love..."

17:52.488 --> 17:54.448
"Dad."

17:54.531 --> 17:56.033
Yeah, that's perfect.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.576
Thank you.

17:57.659 --> 17:58.827
Oh, Ging.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.580
I wish this one
were as simple

18:01.663 --> 18:03.999
as giving you
my leftover banana bread.

18:04.082 --> 18:06.668
Girl:
I'm so nervous...

18:06.752 --> 18:09.505
(<i> kids talking</i> )

18:10.964 --> 18:13.550
Psst... I don't think
he's here yet.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.011
He'll be here.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.014
He doesn't have a giant
silver Afro, does he?

18:19.097 --> 18:22.059
{\an1}He kind of
looks like me.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.853
You'll see him
after the show.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.105
Courtney:
And I used the edge of my brush

18:27.189 --> 18:30.442
to make a pattern that looks
like the bark of a tree. See?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.696
Thank you all very much.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.573
This canvas is priced to sell
at $13,000.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.826
A Gripling original.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.035
(<i> applause</i> )

18:40.118 --> 18:41.036
Oh, we better go.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.371
Break a leg, Ginger.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.414
See you
after the show.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.086
{\an1}I'm a tough act
to follow, Ginger.

18:49.169 --> 18:49.503
But good luck trying.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.630
(<i> whimpers</i> )

18:51.713 --> 18:53.590
Thank you so much for coming.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.300
I'm sure you all agree

18:55.384 --> 18:58.345
we have some incredibly
talented students

18:58.428 --> 18:59.596
here at Lucky Junior High.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.643
We'd like to close the night out
with an original poetry reading

19:04.726 --> 19:08.230
from a very gifted seventh
grader-- Ginger Foutley.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.399
(<i> applause</i> )

19:10.482 --> 19:12.901
(<i> whooping and cheering</i> )

19:18.365 --> 19:21.702
This is a poem
for someone special.

19:21.785 --> 19:27.082
It's called "Hello, Stranger."

19:27.165 --> 19:31.420
"Hello, Stranger,
you came just in time.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.966
"I look for your face
in a crowd or in line.

19:36.049 --> 19:39.386
"Hello, Stranger,
not a moment too soon.

19:39.469 --> 19:44.558
"See, that old picture's fading
in the drawer of my room.

19:44.641 --> 19:48.937
"Now, toys have gone lost,
baby teeth have come loose

19:49.021 --> 19:53.692
"There were accidents
involving stitches, spilt juice.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.403
"Report cards were shown,
and one time I got sick

19:56.486 --> 20:01.408
"but it's nothing I couldn't
catch you up on real quick.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.786
"Hello, Stranger,
I saved you a place

20:04.870 --> 20:07.205
"and it hardly seems strange...

20:15.172 --> 20:19.051
Now that I've seen your face."

20:19.134 --> 20:19.843
Thank you.

20:19.927 --> 20:28.602
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

20:28.685 --> 20:30.187
Thank you.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.028
Well done, Ginger.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.321
Bravo!

20:39.404 --> 20:41.990
Oh, I have got
the permanent chills

20:42.074 --> 20:45.535
{\an1}and I don't think they're
ever going to go away.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.372
{\an1}I know someone
you can see about that.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.500
You were terrific,
Ginger. Just great.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.668
Thanks, everyone.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.795
You killed them
out there, Tiger!

20:54.878 --> 20:55.504
Who's a fighter?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.547
Who's a fighter,
who's a fighter?

20:57.631 --> 20:58.674
Dad, let go.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.675
Ow... that hurts.

20:59.758 --> 21:00.884
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

21:00.968 --> 21:01.385
Let go, Dad.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.097
Great poem, Ging.

21:05.180 --> 21:08.517
{\an5}I mean, I think
he really would
have liked it.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.688
Look, it was
really short notice.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.440
And it's not like
he officially accepted

21:15.524 --> 21:18.026
so he didn't exactly
break a promise.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.403
Thanks, Darren.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.779
Man:
Ginger Foutley?

21:20.862 --> 21:23.407
I have a delivery
for Ginger Foutley?

21:24.574 --> 21:27.202
Wow! Thanks!

21:27.285 --> 21:29.204
Who are they from,
Ginger?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.539
Who sent them?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.167
If this turns out to be

21:34.251 --> 21:37.004
one of those
"secret admirer" situations

21:37.087 --> 21:38.755
I will positively scream.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.507
{\an1}Well?
Who sent them?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.681
They're from my dad!

21:48.432 --> 21:51.685
{\an1}Would you just buy
a vowel already?

21:51.768 --> 21:52.811
{\an1}Sheesh!

21:52.894 --> 21:54.563
(<i> footsteps approach</i> )

21:54.646 --> 21:55.272
Okay, you two Foutleys

21:55.355 --> 21:57.774
{\an1}we've got all
the lab work back

21:57.858 --> 21:59.317
and everything
is just fine.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.695
{\an1}Both of you can go home
in the morning.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.947
(<i> grunting</i> )

22:04.031 --> 22:05.907
You are tireless, Carl.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.409
{\an1}Truly.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.118
(<i> phone rings</i> )

22:08.201 --> 22:11.413
(<i> screeching</i>
<i>and hooting</i> )

22:11.496 --> 22:14.082
You hold the patent
on weird, Carl.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.083
Seriously.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.752
Put Mom on.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.003
{\an1}Lois: Hey.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.755
I heard you were dynamite!

22:19.838 --> 22:20.881
Standing ovation
and everything.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.633
Yeah, it was all right.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.802
How's your baby sea snake?

22:25.886 --> 22:26.928
(<i> laughs</i> )
I'm happy to say

22:27.012 --> 22:29.931
there will be no new additions
to the Foutley family.

22:30.015 --> 22:30.932
I've been pronounced snake-less.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.060
But enough about me.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.020
I want all the details
from Arts Night

22:35.103 --> 22:36.897
and don't skip
any of the good parts.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.107
Okay, but, Ma...?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.275
Yeah?

22:40.358 --> 22:42.486
I just want to...

22:42.569 --> 22:43.945
I mean...

22:44.029 --> 22:46.531
Thanks for the flowers.
