WEBVTT

00:05.126 --> 00:07.048
( music playing

00:07.048 --> 00:08.509
Next.

00:10.091 --> 00:11.762
What's up, Douglas?
Doing a price check

00:11.762 --> 00:13.184
on bionic kids?

00:14.725 --> 00:17.058
Ooh, I wonder how much
I'm worth.

00:17.058 --> 00:20.061
Well, we could sell you
for parts and find out.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.812
All right. Well,
just don't sell the part

00:21.812 --> 00:23.023
that does this.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.105
Ow!

00:26.567 --> 00:29.650
I'm just cataloging
everyone's bionic abilities.

00:29.650 --> 00:31.532
Oh, cool, count me in.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.864
Adam, we already know
what your abilities are.

00:33.864 --> 00:35.746
Ugh, okay, you got me.

00:35.746 --> 00:37.368
I just really like
waiting in lines.

00:40.751 --> 00:41.752
In addition to the bionics

00:41.752 --> 00:43.124
we know they have,

00:43.124 --> 00:44.335
Krane also gave them a lot

00:44.335 --> 00:45.926
of weird hidden abilities.

00:45.926 --> 00:47.088
I'm just trying to get a grip

00:47.088 --> 00:48.549
on what we're dealing with.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.800
What does that guy have?

00:51.512 --> 00:52.883
Check it out!

00:54.555 --> 00:55.936
Oh, no,

00:55.936 --> 00:58.639
my lunch is undercooked.

00:58.639 --> 01:00.851
Oh, Thermo Hands!

01:07.398 --> 01:08.399
( sizzling )

01:12.993 --> 01:14.955
Why, thank you.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.959
Sweet ability, dude.

01:18.959 --> 01:19.790
Ow! Hot! Hot! Hot!

01:19.790 --> 01:21.122
Ooh!

01:21.122 --> 01:23.124
Hey, those things
are dangerous.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.915
Try it again,
I'm sure they've cooled down.

01:24.915 --> 01:26.797
Oh, no, I'm not
falling for that.

01:26.797 --> 01:28.879
I got her.

01:28.879 --> 01:29.760
Ow!

01:32.012 --> 01:33.304
Narrator: The world's
 first bionic

01:33.304 --> 01:34.975
super humans.

01:34.975 --> 01:36.387
They're stronger than us,

01:36.387 --> 01:39.310
faster, smarter.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.932
The next generation
 of the human race is...

01:41.932 --> 01:43.894
Living on a bionic island.

01:46.987 --> 01:49.730
( music playing )

02:20.020 --> 02:21.021
Hey, Chase,

02:21.021 --> 02:22.893
you are not going
to believe this.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.024
Another student

02:24.024 --> 02:25.646
has the Commando app.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.068
What? I thought I was
the only one with that app.

02:28.068 --> 02:29.190
Yeah,

02:29.190 --> 02:30.901
you're not that special.

02:32.733 --> 02:33.864
Don't look at me.
I've been trying

02:33.864 --> 02:35.115
to tell you that for years.

02:37.077 --> 02:38.989
So which one of these

02:38.989 --> 02:40.241
manly warriors

02:40.241 --> 02:42.703
is following in my footsteps?

02:43.704 --> 02:44.705
Her.

02:44.705 --> 02:46.287
( grunting )

02:46.287 --> 02:47.418
Open!

02:48.419 --> 02:49.500
Kate?!

02:49.500 --> 02:51.051
She's the most timid girl

02:51.051 --> 02:52.052
in the whole academy.

02:52.052 --> 02:53.464
I've seen her run

02:53.464 --> 02:56.096
from her own shadow.

02:56.096 --> 02:57.097
And that's the beauty

02:57.097 --> 02:59.009
of the Commando app.

02:59.009 --> 03:00.391
The enemy is caught off guard

03:00.391 --> 03:02.893
by a non-threatening subject.

03:04.014 --> 03:05.976
But I have the Commando app.

03:05.976 --> 03:06.937
( chuckles )

03:06.937 --> 03:08.769
Yes, you do.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.733
Look, I didn't want
to scare Kate,

03:12.733 --> 03:16.237
so I told her that she had
a sonic scream ability instead.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.119
So until I can figure out
a way to remove the app,

03:19.119 --> 03:20.581
make sure nothing triggers it

03:20.581 --> 03:23.123
and sets off Spikette.

03:23.123 --> 03:24.705
Spikette?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.166
Catchy, right?

03:27.878 --> 03:29.960
I like it and I'm keeping it!

03:31.962 --> 03:34.094
Man, this is perfect.

03:34.094 --> 03:36.337
I've never seen
my Commando app in action.

03:36.337 --> 03:37.928
If I can activate Spikette

03:37.928 --> 03:39.970
maybe I could figure out
a way to control it,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.392
which would help
the both of us.

03:41.392 --> 03:42.973
Uh-uh, no way,
you heard Douglas.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.476
He doesn't want us triggering
a dangerous app.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.648
But I can...
 No, Chase!

03:47.648 --> 03:49.730
We are not here to
experiment on the students.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.901
We're here to help them.

03:52.062 --> 03:53.694
Fine.

03:53.694 --> 03:55.065
Excuse me, Chase?

03:55.065 --> 03:56.657
Can you help me open this?

03:56.657 --> 03:57.858
Sure.

03:59.450 --> 04:02.122
Wait, did you just ask
for my help?

04:02.122 --> 04:03.954
Yes.

04:03.954 --> 04:06.166
So you want me

04:06.166 --> 04:07.748
to help you?

04:07.748 --> 04:08.959
Uh-huh.

04:08.959 --> 04:10.961
Me, Chase,

04:10.961 --> 04:12.753
is going to help you, Kate...

04:12.753 --> 04:14.875
Okay. Maybe I should
just ask someone else.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.007
Oh, no! You asked for my help
and you're getting it!

04:17.007 --> 04:18.798
There's no turning back!

04:18.798 --> 04:22.091
( music playing )

04:22.091 --> 04:24.144
Hey, Leo, can I get you a snack?

04:24.144 --> 04:25.596
No, I'm good.

04:25.596 --> 04:27.558
Okay. How about a pillow
to prop your feet?

04:27.558 --> 04:28.769
No thanks.
 Okay, how about something

04:28.769 --> 04:29.980
to drink?
 Nah.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.812
Will you just say
you want something?!

04:33.193 --> 04:35.155
Fine, I guess
I'll take a tomato juice.

04:35.155 --> 04:36.657
Water it is.

04:38.198 --> 04:41.201
( whirring )

04:42.993 --> 04:45.666
( beeping )

04:45.666 --> 04:47.207
( whirring continues )

04:47.207 --> 04:49.209
So, what do you think?

04:49.209 --> 04:50.290
I call it...

04:50.290 --> 04:52.212
drone delivery service,

04:52.212 --> 04:54.415
also known as delivery
service by drone,

04:54.415 --> 04:57.548
also known as service
by delivery drone. Also known...

04:57.548 --> 04:58.969
I got it.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.633
Hey, you know what we should
do with this drone?

05:02.633 --> 05:03.884
Hmm, I'm one step
ahead of you

05:03.884 --> 05:05.015
but who do we know at NASA

05:05.015 --> 05:06.887
and where can we get a ferret?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.930
We can send the drone
to our house and have it bring

05:09.930 --> 05:11.392
some of our favorite stuff here.

05:11.392 --> 05:13.484
Like my fish tank.
 And my bike.

05:13.484 --> 05:15.145
My vanity dresser.

05:16.527 --> 05:18.399
You know, where I keep
all my tools

05:18.399 --> 05:19.940
and boxing gloves

05:19.940 --> 05:21.442
and other assorted

05:21.442 --> 05:23.283
gentlemanly things.

05:24.284 --> 05:26.206
Like your dolls?

05:26.206 --> 05:28.789
They're not dolls,
they're action figures!

05:28.789 --> 05:31.001
It's just sometimes
I like to brush

05:31.001 --> 05:32.453
their hair before battle.

05:34.214 --> 05:36.086
( music playing )

05:36.086 --> 05:38.048
What does it take
to trigger this app?

05:38.048 --> 05:40.260
We've tried fear, intimidation.

05:40.260 --> 05:41.962
Embarrassment.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.266
I don't mean to be rude,
but how is this helping me

05:46.266 --> 05:47.888
open a bottle of ketchup?

05:47.888 --> 05:50.100
Oh, ketchup,
you're still on that?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.232
This is a life lesson,
use mustard.

05:53.273 --> 05:54.395
Okay.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.606
I'll go find some.

05:57.027 --> 05:59.189
Chase, I need
the basement keycard.

05:59.189 --> 06:01.902
I'm having a foosball table
delivered, so to make room

06:01.902 --> 06:03.574
I'm putting your capsule
in the dumpster.

06:04.785 --> 06:06.326
Can't you see that I'm busy?

06:06.326 --> 06:07.908
So am I, I'm trying
to throw something out

06:07.908 --> 06:09.289
you need to survive.

06:10.290 --> 06:12.292
Give me the keycard.

06:12.292 --> 06:13.163
Cut it out!

06:13.163 --> 06:15.125
Give me that!
 Put me down!

06:15.125 --> 06:17.588
Got it.
 Ow! Cut it out!

06:18.799 --> 06:19.920
Stop!

06:19.920 --> 06:21.301
( grunting )

06:21.301 --> 06:22.132
( beeping )

06:22.132 --> 06:23.343
Hey, wait!

06:23.343 --> 06:24.805
She's responding!

06:24.805 --> 06:26.767
Keep hurting me!

06:26.767 --> 06:28.098
Good for you, Chase.

06:28.098 --> 06:29.810
You're finally learning
to accept it.

06:31.311 --> 06:32.142
( beeping )

06:40.320 --> 06:41.862
Drop the boy-child

06:41.862 --> 06:44.695
before I pull your tonsils
out your nose!

06:48.118 --> 06:49.530
What is that?!

06:50.791 --> 06:52.793
Adam, you did it!

06:52.793 --> 06:54.705
That is Spikette.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.297
Really?

06:57.297 --> 06:59.920
Huh, this whole time
I've been calling her Janet.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.131
( grunts )

07:02.172 --> 07:03.464
Whoa!

07:03.464 --> 07:05.636
( crash )

07:05.636 --> 07:07.758
Whoa! I had no idea

07:07.758 --> 07:09.099
the Commando app was so...

07:10.551 --> 07:13.854
Shh. Baby good now.

07:15.055 --> 07:18.188
( music playing )

07:18.188 --> 07:19.560
Leo,

07:19.560 --> 07:21.021
what would you say if I told you

07:21.021 --> 07:23.023
I just got beat up
by a 90-pound girl?

07:23.023 --> 07:24.775
Welcome to the club?

07:26.156 --> 07:27.948
Ooh, I see your stuff
has arrived.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.409
Oh, yeah, the foosball
table's all set up,

07:29.409 --> 07:31.371
but the trampoline won't fit
through the door.

07:31.371 --> 07:32.663
So you're just gonna
have to use your heat vision

07:32.663 --> 07:34.204
to blast a hole in the roof.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.206
Oh, Leo, don't be ridiculous.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.248
Go get a ladder
and I'll just punch a hole.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.131
Oh, that's the drone.

07:41.131 --> 07:42.843
I sent it to pick us up pizza.

07:42.843 --> 07:47.928
Whoo!

07:49.389 --> 07:50.350
Whoa!

07:50.350 --> 07:52.222
That was awesome!

07:53.594 --> 07:55.145
What the...how--

07:56.517 --> 07:59.149
Did we just steal a kid
from the mainland?!

07:59.149 --> 08:00.230
No,

08:00.230 --> 08:02.773
you just stole a kid
from the mainland.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.605
What have you done?!

08:07.067 --> 08:09.199
We need to get him out
of here before he realizes

08:09.199 --> 08:11.201
where he is and who we are.

08:11.201 --> 08:13.033
This is the Bionic Academy

08:13.033 --> 08:15.245
and you're Adam and Leo!

08:16.246 --> 08:18.418
He knows. He knows!

08:18.418 --> 08:21.001
I wanna see every inch
of this place!

08:21.001 --> 08:24.424
Oh, no. Sorry,
that's not gonna happen.

08:24.424 --> 08:25.586
Whoa, whoa.

08:25.586 --> 08:27.427
Oh, yes, it is.

08:27.427 --> 08:28.719
Excuse me?

08:28.719 --> 08:31.301
I'm a sweet, lovable kid

08:31.301 --> 08:34.134
whose parents are probably
wondering where he is.

08:34.134 --> 08:35.225
And I'd hate
to have to tell them that

08:35.225 --> 08:37.136
two bionic heroes

08:37.136 --> 08:38.729
drone-napped me.

08:39.730 --> 08:41.602
We did not drone-nap you.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.813
It was an accident.
Now it's time for you to go.

08:43.813 --> 08:47.487
Did I mention my dad's
chief of police?

08:47.487 --> 08:49.650
Welcome to our home.

08:49.650 --> 08:50.911
Whoa, whoa, whoa, your dad

08:50.911 --> 08:53.033
is chief of police?!

08:53.033 --> 08:55.075
Do you think if
I give him back his son

08:55.075 --> 08:57.327
he'll fix my parking ticket?

08:57.327 --> 09:00.330
( music playing )

09:02.873 --> 09:04.374
Chase, what's going on
in here?!

09:04.374 --> 09:05.796
Um...

09:05.796 --> 09:07.798
You activated
Kate's Commando app,

09:07.798 --> 09:09.219
didn't you?!

09:09.219 --> 09:10.931
What? No!

09:10.931 --> 09:14.514
( Kate screams )

09:14.514 --> 09:16.807
Okay, technically
I didn't do it.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.730
Adam did when he attacked me.
 Wait, what?

09:19.730 --> 09:22.102
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would her Commando app

09:22.102 --> 09:23.984
kick in if you were the one
who was getting attacked?

09:23.984 --> 09:25.485
It must be triggered
by some kind

09:25.485 --> 09:26.777
of mama bear instinct.

09:26.777 --> 09:28.528
And now it's glitching
like crazy.

09:28.528 --> 09:30.490
First, she's trying to baby me,

09:30.490 --> 09:32.993
and then, she's trying
to destroy everything in sight.

09:32.993 --> 09:36.076
( grunts )

09:36.076 --> 09:38.198
What were you thinking?!

09:38.198 --> 09:40.751
Stay away from baby!

09:40.751 --> 09:42.753
Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry.

09:43.754 --> 09:45.085
( grunts )

09:45.085 --> 09:46.336
I don't get it. My Commando app

09:46.336 --> 09:48.208
would've shut down a while ago.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.339
But Kate's adrenaline levels

09:49.339 --> 09:50.340
are going through the roof!

09:50.340 --> 09:51.551
Okay. Then just shut her down!

09:51.551 --> 09:53.714
Oh, it's a great idea, you know,

09:53.714 --> 09:55.345
I hadn't thought of that.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.057
I can't, I don't know how!

09:57.057 --> 09:59.349
Oh.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.561
Maybe if we just
contain her in here,

10:01.561 --> 10:02.683
we'll be okay.

10:02.683 --> 10:04.645
( grunts )

10:09.319 --> 10:11.571
Then again, maybe not.

10:13.533 --> 10:17.077
Baby want toy?

10:17.077 --> 10:18.408
You know, for a maniac,

10:18.408 --> 10:20.500
her maternal instincts
are dead on.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.242
( music playing )

10:28.709 --> 10:30.550
So you turned Kate
into Spikette

10:30.550 --> 10:32.462
even though I told you not to?

10:32.462 --> 10:34.464
You know, I try
to be the fun uncle,

10:34.464 --> 10:36.636
but you people make it so hard.

10:38.558 --> 10:42.102
I'm sorry. I wanted to observe
the Commando app.

10:42.102 --> 10:45.395
And now that I have,
my scientific conclusion is:

10:46.396 --> 10:48.358
I'm scared.

10:48.358 --> 10:50.270
( grunting )

10:50.270 --> 10:52.572
Oh, look, she's taking
a snack break

10:52.572 --> 10:55.275
before she destroys
the rest of the academy.

10:56.737 --> 10:58.368
No fork, no plate.

10:58.368 --> 11:01.491
Where are her manners?

11:01.491 --> 11:02.833
You grilled your lunch

11:02.833 --> 11:04.955
on a kid's dirty hands.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.708
In the name of science!

11:09.129 --> 11:10.550
The only way to stop the app

11:10.550 --> 11:12.252
is to manually
override the chip.

11:12.252 --> 11:13.553
So first we have to...

11:13.553 --> 11:14.554
Okay. Get the chip.

11:14.554 --> 11:16.216
I'm on it.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.561
Mommy chewed food.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.393
Open your mouth!

11:24.394 --> 11:26.186
Baby good, baby good!

11:27.808 --> 11:29.609
Wait, the chip extractor.

11:29.609 --> 11:30.811
Throw it to me.

11:32.572 --> 11:34.574
Not safe for baby.

11:34.574 --> 11:38.158
( grunts )

11:38.158 --> 11:39.950
Great, now what
are we gonna do?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.531
I don't know,
but so far panicking

11:41.531 --> 11:44.374
and hiding behind things
is working for me.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.416
We're gonna have to use
physical force to restrain her

11:46.416 --> 11:49.589
which means you are
gonna have to get aggressive.

11:49.589 --> 11:52.542
Really aggressive.

11:52.542 --> 11:55.595
Spikette needs
to meet her match.

11:55.595 --> 11:57.547
Oh, no. No, no, no.

11:57.547 --> 12:00.140
You can't turn me into Spike.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.551
But I can.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.516
( laughs )

12:06.516 --> 12:09.109
( screams )

12:09.109 --> 12:12.612
( laughing )

12:12.612 --> 12:15.615
Oh, baby.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.490
( beeping )

12:21.862 --> 12:25.495
( roars )

12:25.495 --> 12:28.128
What are you chuckle nuggets
laughing at?!

12:28.128 --> 12:29.459
Never seen a grown man

12:29.459 --> 12:31.421
in a diaper before?

12:32.873 --> 12:33.874
( roars )

12:35.876 --> 12:37.087
Baby?

12:37.087 --> 12:39.469
Baby!

12:39.469 --> 12:41.641
Oh, I'm no baby.

12:41.641 --> 12:43.303
I'm a man sandwich

12:43.303 --> 12:47.097
served with a
tall glass of macho.

12:47.097 --> 12:50.390
Well, are you man enough
to take her down?

12:50.390 --> 12:51.852
No can do.

12:51.852 --> 12:53.103
She's a lady,

12:53.103 --> 12:56.396
Spike always respects a lady.

12:56.396 --> 12:58.859
This is not a lady.

12:58.859 --> 13:00.660
Hey, who are you calling
not a lady?!

13:00.660 --> 13:04.574
( grunts )

13:04.574 --> 13:05.575
Be right back.

13:05.575 --> 13:07.207
Spike feels...

13:07.207 --> 13:10.080
under-dressed
for this particular occasion.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.122
( squeaking )

13:12.122 --> 13:15.715
( music playing )

13:15.715 --> 13:17.547
Pretty cool place, huh, Reggie?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.549
Yeah! You sure I can keep
all these weapons?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.181
Of course. Every 10-year-old

13:21.181 --> 13:22.682
should have a rocket launcher.

13:24.474 --> 13:25.685
Adam, what are you doing?!

13:25.685 --> 13:27.057
I thought you said
you were going to

13:27.057 --> 13:28.929
convince him to leave.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.391
I tried, but he's
very persuasive.

13:31.391 --> 13:32.692
I told him he had to go.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.774
He said he didn't want to.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.528
It doesn't matter.

13:38.528 --> 13:39.649
Now that I've gotten
to know him,

13:39.649 --> 13:41.281
he's actually pretty cool.

13:41.281 --> 13:42.702
No, he's annoying

13:42.702 --> 13:43.743
and he's going home.

13:43.743 --> 13:45.115
( gasps )

13:45.115 --> 13:46.786
How dare you say that
about my friend?

13:48.158 --> 13:49.289
You know, just for that,

13:49.289 --> 13:51.161
you're not eating with us.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.292
( whirring )

13:56.166 --> 13:57.757
You want Leo's dumplings?

13:57.757 --> 14:00.050
Don't mind if I do.

14:01.922 --> 14:03.763
Okay, that's it.
Both of you are going back

14:03.763 --> 14:05.765
to the mainland!

14:05.765 --> 14:08.558
Adam, I can't eat
with all this racket.

14:08.558 --> 14:11.601
Leo, do you mind?

14:13.773 --> 14:17.187
( music playing )

14:17.187 --> 14:19.609
I don't get it. She's supposed
to be winding down

14:19.609 --> 14:20.981
not getting stronger.

14:20.981 --> 14:23.193
It's a glitch. If her Commando
app keeps going

14:23.193 --> 14:25.445
her chip's gonna burn out
and melt her brain.

14:25.445 --> 14:27.537
And I am not cleaning that up!

14:30.540 --> 14:32.122
I cannot believe Chase.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.543
You know, if I was Spike,

14:33.543 --> 14:35.625
I would be showing
that girl who's boss.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.457
Maybe you can.

14:37.457 --> 14:38.798
Yeah, Spike won't
take out a lady,

14:38.798 --> 14:40.800
but if I give you
the Commando app...

14:40.800 --> 14:43.763
Uh-uh, no way!
 Oh, come on.

14:43.763 --> 14:46.266
It's a new version I can shut
down as soon as you're done.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.559
All you need to do is
subdue Spikette long enough

14:49.559 --> 14:52.222
so I can extract her chip.
 Not gonna happen.

14:52.222 --> 14:53.603
Did I mention you'll be able

14:53.603 --> 14:55.605
to tear Chase apart?

14:55.605 --> 14:56.726
Now, you're talking.

14:56.726 --> 14:58.018
Let's do this, Dougie.

14:59.019 --> 15:02.322
( music playing )

15:02.322 --> 15:04.324
You will meet a new friend.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.909
You will meet a new friend.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.911
What?
 What?

15:18.668 --> 15:21.501
You will get arrested because
your brother is an idiot.

15:22.882 --> 15:25.845
This is about
the dumplings, isn't it?

15:27.847 --> 15:28.848
This has gone on long enough.

15:28.848 --> 15:30.220
Either he goes home

15:30.220 --> 15:31.811
or I call Big D.

15:31.811 --> 15:33.393
Leo, would you relax?
You're just jealous

15:33.393 --> 15:34.814
because I'm his favorite.

15:34.814 --> 15:37.477
Actually, Chase is my favorite.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.321
Okay, this kid's gotta go.

15:41.321 --> 15:44.824
( music playing )

15:44.824 --> 15:46.826
Okay, your Commando app

15:46.826 --> 15:48.828
should be...

15:48.828 --> 15:50.070
good to go.

15:51.071 --> 15:52.872
It's not working.

15:52.872 --> 15:54.664
You obviously did
something wrong, because...

15:54.664 --> 15:56.666
( beeping )

15:56.666 --> 15:59.629
I wanna tear your head off!

16:00.880 --> 16:03.633
Hello, Spikerella!

16:05.175 --> 16:06.676
Now that's catchy.

16:09.889 --> 16:11.181
So, little lady,

16:11.181 --> 16:13.593
what else do you like to do?

16:13.593 --> 16:14.894
Rip off people's toes

16:14.894 --> 16:17.397
and use them as chess pieces.

16:18.768 --> 16:21.151
We have so much in common.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.733
( grunts )

16:23.733 --> 16:25.315
Who the heck are you?

16:25.315 --> 16:27.947
Your worst nightmare.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.570
This should be good.

16:30.570 --> 16:33.743
Everyone knows
girls can't fight.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.325
BOTH: Excuse me?

16:36.576 --> 16:38.748
I said girls...

16:38.748 --> 16:41.541
can't fight!

16:41.541 --> 16:43.123
( crash )

16:43.123 --> 16:45.505
Who is the girl now?

16:47.887 --> 16:49.389
( grunting )

16:49.389 --> 16:51.391
( music playing )

16:51.391 --> 16:53.133
All right.
The drone's ready to go.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.934
Coordinates are all set.

16:54.934 --> 16:57.187
All right, time to go, Reggie.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.770
Reggie?

17:00.770 --> 17:01.901
Where is he?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.484
He's gone!

17:05.484 --> 17:07.406
All righty then.
Problem solved.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.242
( music playing )

17:12.242 --> 17:13.532
Nice hair.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.743
Can't wait to rip it out

17:14.743 --> 17:16.415
and use it as a scarf!

17:16.415 --> 17:18.458
Go ahead
then I'll shave your back

17:18.458 --> 17:20.039
and make some matching mittens.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.752
( both grunting )

17:25.835 --> 17:26.965
Whoa!

17:28.468 --> 17:30.670
What's going on in here?

17:30.670 --> 17:33.012
New baby!

17:33.012 --> 17:35.345
I'm not a baby.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.476
Baby cranky,

17:36.476 --> 17:38.558
must be hungry.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.232
There you are.
You're out of here, Reggie.

17:42.232 --> 17:44.814
I told you,
I'm not going anywhere.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.106
Lunchy munchy!

17:46.106 --> 17:47.607
Open mouthy!

17:47.607 --> 17:48.738
( screams )

17:53.453 --> 17:55.325
Get me out of here!

17:55.325 --> 17:57.827
Who's that?!

17:57.827 --> 17:59.789
Long story short,

17:59.789 --> 18:00.960
Leo's going to jail.

18:02.252 --> 18:03.833
Help me!

18:03.833 --> 18:06.045
Oh, so now you're ready to go?

18:06.045 --> 18:07.707
Yes!

18:09.209 --> 18:10.670
Grab him.

18:11.671 --> 18:12.672
( grunts )

18:12.672 --> 18:14.053
Baby!

18:14.053 --> 18:15.845
( grunts )

18:18.808 --> 18:20.850
You promise not to tell anyone
you were here?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.101
Yes.
 And you won't tell anyone

18:22.101 --> 18:23.643
we drone-napped you?

18:23.643 --> 18:25.435
We didn't drone-nap him!

18:26.436 --> 18:28.067
Ah, exactly.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.860
Can you lie as good
as Leo just did?

18:31.901 --> 18:33.193
I don't have to.

18:33.193 --> 18:35.034
My dad's not chief of police,

18:35.034 --> 18:36.696
he works at a bowling alley.

18:37.947 --> 18:39.289
Get out of here!

18:44.744 --> 18:47.046
Okay. Now that that's over,

18:47.046 --> 18:50.009
help Bree or another game
of foosball?

18:50.009 --> 18:51.050
Foosball.
 Foosball.

18:51.050 --> 18:53.092
( Kate screams )

18:53.092 --> 18:55.515
( Kate grunting )

18:55.515 --> 18:57.096
Get back here! I'm not done

18:57.096 --> 18:59.639
throwing you!

18:59.639 --> 19:01.261
The chip extractor's
almost fixed.

19:01.261 --> 19:02.522
Hurry up and take her down!

19:02.522 --> 19:04.894
Shut it or I'll take you down!

19:04.894 --> 19:07.857
Carry on.

19:07.857 --> 19:09.148
( both grunting )

19:09.148 --> 19:10.770
( music playing )

19:19.329 --> 19:21.991
Picked that one up
in dance class.

19:21.991 --> 19:22.872
( music continues )

19:27.877 --> 19:29.709
Where do you think you're going?

19:35.925 --> 19:37.887
That's one way
to clean a window.

20:06.286 --> 20:07.957
Got it!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.379
She should be out
for a while,

20:09.379 --> 20:11.921
plenty of time for me
to adjust her settings.

20:14.093 --> 20:16.756
Oh, what happened?

20:18.177 --> 20:20.099
Bree?! What's going on?

20:20.099 --> 20:21.681
You again!

20:21.681 --> 20:23.603
Still think girls can't fight?

20:23.603 --> 20:25.144
( roars )

20:25.144 --> 20:27.397
I'm not so sure you are a girl.

20:27.397 --> 20:28.808
( roars )

20:28.808 --> 20:31.190
( music playing )

20:34.944 --> 20:37.907
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson.

20:37.907 --> 20:39.949
Definitely.

20:39.949 --> 20:42.362
Girls can fight.

20:42.362 --> 20:43.493
Yup.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.075
Now, go apologize to Kate.

20:48.668 --> 20:51.080
Um, hi, Kate.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.872
Good to see you.

20:54.374 --> 20:56.966
Look, I really just
want to apologize

20:56.966 --> 20:58.678
for being so selfish.

20:58.678 --> 21:00.089
I never should've used you

21:00.089 --> 21:01.511
as a science experiment.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.434
It's okay, I forgive you.

21:04.434 --> 21:05.595
You do?

21:05.595 --> 21:06.726
Thanks.

21:06.726 --> 21:07.807
No problem.

21:07.807 --> 21:10.650
But one more thing.
 Sure.

21:10.650 --> 21:13.443
Don't ever use me
as a human guinea pig.

21:13.443 --> 21:18.358
Mm-mm.
 Again!

21:24.243 --> 21:25.575
Oh...
