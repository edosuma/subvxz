02:20.880 --> 02:23.480
No, Sidney.
G.K.O.'s are Russian bonds.

02:23.482 --> 02:26.249
They guarantee you
65% interest on your money,

02:26.251 --> 02:29.819
their government's never
defaulted on one, it's safe.

02:29.821 --> 02:31.787
It's a lock at 65% on your money.

02:31.789 --> 02:34.089
So if you want in for 10 million, do it.

02:34.091 --> 02:36.791
Michelle, get me Bill Moore, Skip Regent.

02:36.793 --> 02:38.893
I need 20 clients back to back to back.

02:38.895 --> 02:39.827
We have 35 minutes left.

02:39.829 --> 02:40.894
You're working
the G.K.O?

02:40.896 --> 02:42.095
And, yes, Isaac, it's my day off.

02:42.097 --> 02:45.364
I'm late for an appointment
which I can't break.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.498
Because, sweetheart,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.801
these funds are never available
to individual investors

02:49.803 --> 02:53.070
except this one just opened
with a 2-hour window

02:53.072 --> 02:55.305
of which there are...

02:55.307 --> 02:56.906
34 minutes left.

02:56.908 --> 02:58.107
So speak up.

02:58.109 --> 02:59.908
Do you wanna be rich,

02:59.910 --> 03:01.576
or do you wanna wallow in regret?

03:01.578 --> 03:05.112
Whatever I'm taking,
you make me work for it.

03:05.114 --> 03:06.313
Love to Emily.

03:06.315 --> 03:08.815
Stell, I'm in trouble, OK?
I need you.

03:08.817 --> 03:11.384
Let me get with you at the end of the day.

03:11.386 --> 03:13.319
I may have blown off Peg Heinrich,

03:13.321 --> 03:15.854
and I can't wait for the end of the day.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.256
I'll be right in.

03:18.258 --> 03:19.223
Thanks.

03:19.225 --> 03:20.924
Bill Moore on 2.

03:20.926 --> 03:23.126
Theresa, confirm Sidney at 10 million,

03:23.128 --> 03:26.229
65% due 2-28-99 at par.

03:26.231 --> 03:27.930
Yes, Miss Payne.

03:27.932 --> 03:29.164
Hello, Bill.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.265
Stella.

03:30.267 --> 03:31.232
How you doing?

03:31.234 --> 03:33.000
Feel like making some money?

03:33.002 --> 03:34.801
All right.

03:38.239 --> 03:39.938
I'm thinking about introducing Stella

03:39.940 --> 03:42.140
to one of Kennedy's golf buddies.

03:42.142 --> 03:43.174
He's a judge.

03:43.176 --> 03:46.076
Angela, you don't know
what brand of men Stella likes.

03:46.078 --> 03:48.044
Neither does she, so be quiet.

03:48.046 --> 03:49.578
You need to mind your own business.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.514
And you can start by checking
the want ads for a maid,

03:52.516 --> 03:53.915
and stop being so damn cheap.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.851
No one knows how to clean
my house better than I do.

03:56.853 --> 03:58.152
The judge is very nice.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.520
Which means boring as hell.

03:59.522 --> 04:02.589
And you can tell him not to get
his hopes up on Stella,

04:02.591 --> 04:05.024
'cause our sister is stuck on stale.

04:05.026 --> 04:06.158
Right now,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.293
what other prospects does she have?

04:08.295 --> 04:09.861
None.

04:12.866 --> 04:14.332
How was the mud?

04:14.334 --> 04:15.199
We don't do mud.

04:15.201 --> 04:16.433
And in case you were wondering

04:16.435 --> 04:19.369
if we were talking about
you behind your back,

04:19.370 --> 04:20.202
we were.

04:20.204 --> 04:21.470
Look, I'm here to relax

04:21.471 --> 04:22.604
because I stress enough at work.

04:22.606 --> 04:26.240
Besides, I thought you guys were my allies.

04:26.242 --> 04:27.608
We are, Stella,

04:27.610 --> 04:29.910
but when's the last time
you had a decent date?

04:29.912 --> 04:30.944
Tell the truth.

04:30.946 --> 04:32.612
When was the last time
you paid a bill on time?

04:32.614 --> 04:34.213
Now you tell the truth.

04:34.215 --> 04:35.314
She's got a point.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.048
Shut up, Angela,

04:36.050 --> 04:37.582
before I put a curse on you

04:37.584 --> 04:40.384
and them babies turn out
looking like gerbils.

04:42.621 --> 04:44.087
Anything else, Cruella?

04:44.089 --> 04:48.558
Don't talk to me for the next 2 hours.

04:54.566 --> 04:55.898
You need a husband,

04:55.900 --> 04:57.232
and your son needs a father.

04:57.234 --> 05:00.535
Had one. Got rid of him.
So glad I did.

05:00.537 --> 05:02.003
And the last time I checked,

05:02.005 --> 05:03.471
Walter was still Quincy's father,

05:03.473 --> 05:04.538
in case you've forgotten.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.973
You still need a man in your life.

05:08.876 --> 05:09.941
Look, Angela,

05:09.943 --> 05:12.043
just because Kennedy writes,
produces, directs, and stars

05:12.045 --> 05:14.311
in all 3 acts of your drama,
don't fool yourself.

05:14.313 --> 05:17.047
Every woman doesn't need
that kind of guidance.

05:17.049 --> 05:19.516
You can be so defensive.
It's really sad.

05:19.518 --> 05:21.584
Well, maybe if you'd have listened to mama

05:21.586 --> 05:22.418
instead of marrying

05:22.420 --> 05:23.919
the second guy you ever slept with...

05:23.921 --> 05:26.087
Why don't you just induce labor,

05:26.089 --> 05:28.222
so you can hurry up and have
somebody you can boss around.

05:28.224 --> 05:30.524
Girl, I'm gonna get up from here right now.

05:30.526 --> 05:32.092
Don't let my water break.

05:32.094 --> 05:33.526
Hey, ladies, ladies!

05:33.528 --> 05:39.398
I am not feeling any love
in this room at this time.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.102
Correct me if I'm wrong, Stella,

05:46.104 --> 05:47.336
but this is your treat,

05:47.338 --> 05:49.671
'cause you know my money is too funny.

05:49.673 --> 05:52.040
Tsk.

05:54.643 --> 05:56.409
No, you didn't.

05:56.411 --> 05:58.978
No, you didn't.

06:01.648 --> 06:03.681
Wait, you don't even know us.

06:03.683 --> 06:05.382
Why you laughing?

06:08.987 --> 06:10.486
She's so fake.

06:10.488 --> 06:12.154
Look at her over there.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.657
Girl, you too many things.

06:25.201 --> 06:26.433
Keep up with me.

06:26.435 --> 06:28.067
Yeah. OK!

06:28.969 --> 06:31.736
OK, girls, let's have all the tickets here.

06:31.738 --> 06:33.037
And whatever you do,

06:33.039 --> 06:35.105
don't say anything about his weight.

06:35.107 --> 06:36.539
Mom, give me a break.

06:36.541 --> 06:38.207
Dad never reads labels.

06:38.209 --> 06:39.575
Calories or fat,

06:39.577 --> 06:41.476
cholesterol, sodium...

06:41.478 --> 06:44.045
That stuff means nothing to him.

06:44.714 --> 06:45.579
So, Mom,

06:45.581 --> 06:47.080
what you gonna do for 2 whole weeks

06:47.082 --> 06:48.614
without your loving son?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.182
Clean your room.

06:50.184 --> 06:51.183
Mom, no.

06:51.185 --> 06:53.618
Please don't go in my room.
Don't touch anything, OK?

06:53.620 --> 06:54.685
I like it the way it is.

06:54.687 --> 06:56.553
But you can't find anything.

06:56.555 --> 06:57.787
I know where everything is.

06:57.789 --> 07:00.322
It may not look like it, but I do.

07:01.158 --> 07:02.624
What's it worth to you if I don't?

07:02.626 --> 07:04.292
Say, I'll be your best friend.

07:04.294 --> 07:06.327
Right.
You already are, dude.

07:06.329 --> 07:09.463
But, you know, cash
has always worked for me.

07:10.966 --> 07:13.199
Thank you, young man.

07:14.302 --> 07:16.068
What?
What did you forget?

07:16.070 --> 07:19.704
I want you to try to have
some fun while I'm gone, OK?

07:19.706 --> 07:21.305
Sure.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.273
No, I mean it.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.475
I know.

08:38.645 --> 08:41.647
That was such a great day.

08:41.649 --> 08:43.448
We had so much fun.

08:43.450 --> 08:45.583
And Sports Wrap is coming up next.

08:45.585 --> 08:47.117
We'll be back in a moment.

08:49.121 --> 08:53.056
Bored? Stressed out?

08:53.058 --> 08:53.790
Overworked?

08:53.792 --> 08:55.758
Then what you doin' sitting there

08:55.760 --> 08:58.327
when you know you need some sunlight?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.263
All it takes is one little phone call,

09:01.265 --> 09:02.831
and you're on your way

09:02.833 --> 09:05.066
to the most beautiful place on earth,

09:05.068 --> 09:07.701
where the water caresses you by day

09:07.703 --> 09:10.470
and sings you a lullaby at night.

09:10.705 --> 09:13.806
So come on, what you waiting for?

09:13.808 --> 09:15.474
Put down that work, girl.

09:15.476 --> 09:16.842
I said, "What you doin' sitting there",

09:16.844 --> 09:20.412
when you know you need
some sun, Stella?"

09:25.352 --> 09:26.584
Hello?

09:26.586 --> 09:27.484
Yes, Stella.

09:27.486 --> 09:28.685
This is Judge Spencer Boyle.

09:28.687 --> 09:30.653
Your sister Angela gave me your number.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.321
Said you'd be expecting my call.

09:33.290 --> 09:35.590
Yes, Judge...

09:35.592 --> 09:37.658
so nice of you to call.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.594
I was hoping maybe we might...

09:40.596 --> 09:41.661
Why not?

09:41.663 --> 09:44.798
That gives me a lot of options.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.266
Delicious.

09:46.268 --> 09:49.235
That's very refreshing to find a young woman

09:49.237 --> 09:51.971
who doesn't start out playing hard to get.

09:51.973 --> 09:53.906
Yeah, that's me.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.507
I'm easy..

09:55.509 --> 09:56.808
I only meant

09:56.810 --> 09:59.911
that no games is kind of refreshing.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.279
I hear you're an athlete.

10:02.281 --> 10:05.248
Maybe we could go run together sometime.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.416
I don't see why not.

10:07.418 --> 10:08.917
Well, this went well.

10:08.919 --> 10:10.418
Good-bye, Stella.

10:10.420 --> 10:11.519
Bye.

10:19.193 --> 10:21.326
Call your travel agent

10:21.328 --> 10:23.961
or 1-800-Jamaica.

10:23.963 --> 10:27.397
We'll be waiting for you.

10:27.699 --> 10:29.598
Hello, this is Eartha Kitt.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.434
Delilah's not home now,
so leave her a message.

10:32.436 --> 10:33.635
Grrr.

10:34.638 --> 10:36.704
Delilah, where are you, girl?

10:36.706 --> 10:38.305
I got a brilliant idea.

10:38.307 --> 10:39.739
Let's go to Jamaica.

10:39.741 --> 10:41.273
Are you game or lame?

10:41.275 --> 10:42.707
Call me back, a.s.a.p.

10:52.849 --> 10:54.348
Hello, this is Eartha Kitt.

10:54.350 --> 10:57.250
Delilah's not home now
so leave her a message.

10:57.252 --> 10:58.451
Grrr.

10:59.287 --> 11:00.452
Forget that last message.

11:00.454 --> 11:01.853
That was just a stupid
one-minute fantasy.

11:01.855 --> 11:03.721
I don't have time to go
to anybody's anywhere.

11:03.723 --> 11:05.656
I got too much on my plate.

11:05.658 --> 11:07.424
Sorry, girl.

11:07.426 --> 11:08.758
Call me?

11:35.015 --> 11:36.014
Hello?

11:36.016 --> 11:37.048
Bertha,

11:37.050 --> 11:38.983
I'm totally ignoring your second message.

11:38.985 --> 11:41.485
Start packing your shit.

11:41.487 --> 11:41.918
D.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.619
We are going to Jamaica, Miss Thing,

11:43.621 --> 11:46.521
and I don't wanna hear you
tell me why you can't go, OK?

11:46.523 --> 11:48.789
I don't really think I can take the time.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.923
What are you talking about?

11:49.925 --> 11:51.758
You ain't been nowhere and done nothin'

11:51.760 --> 11:53.025
since I was a natural blonde.

11:53.027 --> 11:54.626
And it's only a week.
Just ask them.

11:54.628 --> 11:57.328
I got a deadline with
these shareholder reps.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.030
Well, let them share without you for once.

12:00.032 --> 12:01.998
Quincy's home
baby-sitting his daddy,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.799
and you ain't got nothin' else to do.

12:03.801 --> 12:05.734
See, that's easy for you to say.

12:05.736 --> 12:07.902
They got tons of package
trips from New York.

12:07.904 --> 12:09.703
But since it's so last minute,

12:09.705 --> 12:10.704
I gotta pay full fare.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.405
Look, don't even go there.

12:12.407 --> 12:15.474
Don't even go there.
You being cheap, Stella.

12:15.476 --> 12:16.541
That's not like you.

12:16.543 --> 12:19.477
It's not even attractive,
honey. Don't be cheap.

12:19.479 --> 12:22.313
'Cause you make enough money to do this.

12:22.315 --> 12:23.781
And you're worth it.

12:23.783 --> 12:25.549
And even if you ain't, I am,

12:25.551 --> 12:26.816
so we going to Jamaica.

12:26.818 --> 12:29.819
I feel really privileged
to have this opportunity

12:29.821 --> 12:32.454
to be in your presence.

12:32.456 --> 12:33.788
I have to tell you, though,

12:33.790 --> 12:35.389
I don't want you to get jealous

12:35.391 --> 12:37.124
'cause I lost a couple of pounds.

12:37.126 --> 12:38.024
A couple.

12:38.026 --> 12:40.926
Yeah. Them Jamaican dudes
are gonna be chasing me

12:40.928 --> 12:42.060
all over the island.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.862
You'll be picking up my sloppy seconds.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.964
I gotta go, girl.
Good-bye.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.700
This isn't working.

12:56.974 --> 12:59.841
Can you get me some more
penis material, baby,

12:59.843 --> 13:02.076
'cause these boys are just...

13:02.078 --> 13:04.011
It's painful.

13:04.847 --> 13:07.547
Come on, share with your friend.

13:09.884 --> 13:12.084
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:12.086 --> 13:14.820
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belts sign

13:14.822 --> 13:17.689
for our arrival in Montego Bay,

13:17.691 --> 13:18.856
where as you know,

13:18.858 --> 13:21.658
the weather is always perfect.

13:46.679 --> 13:47.911
Welcome to Jamaica.

13:47.913 --> 13:48.945
Thank you.

13:48.947 --> 13:50.079
Welcome to Jamaica.

13:51.449 --> 13:52.481
Thank you.

13:53.584 --> 13:54.449
Hello.

13:54.451 --> 13:55.149
Hi. Stella Payne.

13:55.151 --> 13:56.116
Sign here, Miss Payne.

13:56.118 --> 13:59.886
Could you tell me which room
Delilah Abraham is in?

13:59.888 --> 14:01.420
Sure.

14:02.823 --> 14:05.657
Ahaaah!

14:05.659 --> 14:06.991
Hey, girl!

14:08.094 --> 14:08.992
Hey, girl!

14:08.994 --> 14:11.094
I've been waiting in the bar
for an hour and a half.

14:11.096 --> 14:13.996
Then where's my rum punch?
You know I could use it.

14:13.998 --> 14:15.397
Well, come on, girl.

14:15.399 --> 14:16.798
You look so fly.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.565
Don't I?

14:17.567 --> 14:19.967
I know you think you're cute
with your new braids.

14:19.969 --> 14:21.568
Yeah.
You like 'em?

14:21.570 --> 14:22.168
I love 'em.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.403
They make you look entirely too damn young.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.470
Wait now, girl.

14:25.472 --> 14:26.771
I want you to wave to Jack and Buddy.

14:26.773 --> 14:30.741
I am not waving to men I don't know.

14:30.743 --> 14:31.875
You will.

14:31.877 --> 14:33.810
Now, they from Chicago
by way of L.A.

14:33.812 --> 14:35.945
They got 3 Superbowl rings between them.

14:35.947 --> 14:38.814
I get Jack, and you get Buddy.

14:41.618 --> 14:43.517
No, you didn't.

14:43.519 --> 14:44.718
Yes, I did.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.754
I did not come all the way down here

14:47.756 --> 14:49.455
to turn into a slut.

14:49.457 --> 14:50.189
I did.

14:50.191 --> 14:51.557
A big old ho slut if I can.

14:51.559 --> 14:53.759
Look, all I wanna do is run, read, relax,

14:53.761 --> 14:55.193
and roll over.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.527
Lord.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.896
Not pick up old, soft football players.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.498
When was your last wide receiver?

15:01.500 --> 15:02.632
OK? OK?

15:02.634 --> 15:03.766
Come on.

15:03.768 --> 15:04.967
Bertha.

15:04.969 --> 15:06.001
What?

15:06.003 --> 15:07.035
I'm gonna get you.

15:07.037 --> 15:09.070
Welcome to Jamaica, ladies.

15:17.946 --> 15:20.479
Respect!

15:20.481 --> 15:21.713
Respect, child.

15:21.715 --> 15:23.448
Irie! Irie!

15:23.450 --> 15:24.682
You good, girl?

15:24.684 --> 15:25.816
I'm good.

15:25.818 --> 15:27.083
You're good?

15:27.085 --> 15:28.084
Yes.

15:28.086 --> 15:29.552
You real good?

15:30.221 --> 15:32.454
Don't scare the white people.

15:38.728 --> 15:39.626
What?

15:39.628 --> 15:41.094
This right here.

15:41.096 --> 15:42.095
Gimme!

15:42.097 --> 15:43.729
It's got my name all over it.

15:43.731 --> 15:45.897
Where's the bathing suit
that goes with this?

15:45.899 --> 15:47.498
I know you better sit down

15:47.500 --> 15:49.032
and be glad I'll let it go for 50.

15:49.034 --> 15:50.666
Yeah, I got your 50.

15:50.668 --> 15:53.802
Gotta tell you, though, I'm glad to see you.

15:53.804 --> 15:54.769
You look good.

15:54.771 --> 15:57.104
That's 'cause you don't know good

15:57.106 --> 15:57.838
from spectacular.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.106
You look good yourself, girl.

16:00.108 --> 16:01.308
Yeah, I know I do.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.010
I think I got a little weak
blood sugar or something.

16:04.012 --> 16:07.279
I been taking ginseng
and sing-sing and hop-sing,

16:07.281 --> 16:09.614
trying to get some pep back in my step.

16:09.616 --> 16:10.748
It ain't hardly working.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.816
When was the last time you had a physical?

16:12.818 --> 16:14.150
Probably about a year ago.

16:14.152 --> 16:15.584
All I know is this...

16:15.586 --> 16:17.552
When I knock on your door in the morning,

16:17.554 --> 16:18.786
have your sneakers on,

16:18.788 --> 16:19.887
and be ready to run.

16:19.889 --> 16:21.288
Tss. You must be
out your mind.

16:21.290 --> 16:23.623
I did not come down here to exercise.

16:23.625 --> 16:24.657
And do you think

16:24.659 --> 16:27.593
they could put a little
more lycra in this thing?

16:27.595 --> 16:28.794
Girl.

16:28.796 --> 16:32.864
As your best friend for the last 22 years,

16:32.866 --> 16:34.131
can I have this?

16:34.133 --> 16:35.699
No.

16:36.201 --> 16:40.770
Can I at least see a picture of my godson?

16:44.742 --> 16:46.708
Now those you can have.

16:46.710 --> 16:48.976
Probably 'cause they're plastic.

16:48.978 --> 16:50.877
But ask me if I care.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.311
Do you care?

16:52.313 --> 16:53.245
Hell no!

16:53.247 --> 16:55.347
I look good in these.

17:03.621 --> 17:04.886
No.

17:11.961 --> 17:14.194
All right.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.702
This Is my favorite.

17:24.637 --> 17:27.271
Just gets the circulation going.

17:29.675 --> 17:30.807
All right.

17:30.809 --> 17:32.241
Go on now.

17:32.243 --> 17:33.342
Come on.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.209
Here we go.

17:34.211 --> 17:35.743
I'm running, girl, like the wind.

17:35.745 --> 17:37.010
Come on, D.
You can do it.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.845
I'm doing it.
Look at me run.

17:38.847 --> 17:39.846
All right.

17:39.848 --> 17:41.380
I'm fast like a mo-fo.

17:41.382 --> 17:42.681
Running.

17:42.683 --> 17:44.315
I'll see you at breakfast.

17:44.317 --> 17:45.249
D!

17:45.251 --> 17:46.817
That was great for me.

17:46.819 --> 17:48.118
I feel warmed up and everything.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.354
I feel like I could just have
the whole day to myself.

17:51.356 --> 17:53.823
I'm bad.

17:53.825 --> 17:55.124
I'm so bad.

17:55.126 --> 17:57.759
I'm bad.
I'm so bad.

18:38.731 --> 18:41.832
Good morning.

18:44.369 --> 18:46.202
Are...

18:46.204 --> 18:48.437
are you a rapper?

18:52.209 --> 18:53.441
No. Sorry.

18:53.443 --> 18:55.209
I... I don't rap.

18:55.911 --> 18:57.410
Lord have mercy.

18:57.412 --> 18:59.979
Why don't they come in this make and model

18:59.981 --> 19:01.947
in my age group?

19:01.949 --> 19:03.815
Excuse me.

19:04.250 --> 19:07.284
Are you dining alone?

19:07.286 --> 19:08.818
Why?

19:08.820 --> 19:11.353
Would you mind if I joined you?

19:14.191 --> 19:15.990
My plate looks lighter than yours,

19:15.992 --> 19:18.459
maybe I should come to your table.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.927
OK.

19:23.232 --> 19:25.098
There oughta be a law

19:25.100 --> 19:27.200
against being young and sexy.

19:27.202 --> 19:29.035
I'm sorry.
What was that?

19:29.937 --> 19:32.203
I said, "Whatever it is,
sure smells good."

19:32.205 --> 19:34.305
I think it's my cologne.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.272
It's new.

19:35.274 --> 19:38.708
No, I meant the food.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.709
Right.

19:40.711 --> 19:41.976
I meant the cologne.

19:41.978 --> 19:44.311
So, you're certainly the most colorful thing

19:44.313 --> 19:46.046
I seen this morning.

19:46.048 --> 19:48.915
What, do you have a problem with pink?

19:48.917 --> 19:50.149
Actually, yes.

19:50.151 --> 19:52.217
I'm in therapy for it.

19:54.821 --> 19:56.187
It was a joke.

19:56.189 --> 19:57.354
So are you enjoying

19:57.356 --> 19:59.889
your first morning here in Jamaica?

19:59.891 --> 20:02.925
Maybe I've been here for weeks.

20:04.061 --> 20:05.393
I would have noticed you.

20:05.395 --> 20:09.230
No, he doesn't call himself flirting.

20:09.232 --> 20:11.966
This is too cute.

20:11.968 --> 20:13.167
So...

20:13.169 --> 20:15.502
what's your name, young man?

20:15.504 --> 20:17.270
My name's Winston.

20:17.272 --> 20:19.405
Winston Shakespeare.

20:19.407 --> 20:21.573
And yours, young lady?

20:21.575 --> 20:23.441
My name's Stella, Winston.

20:23.443 --> 20:25.342
See, I gave you 2 names,

20:25.344 --> 20:26.443
you only gave me one.

20:26.445 --> 20:28.978
Well, the one I gave you
was real, Mr. Shakespeare.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.480
You didn't know Shakespeare
was really black?

20:31.482 --> 20:32.914
Yeah, man.

20:32.916 --> 20:34.782
Socrates, too.

20:35.551 --> 20:36.850
So...

20:36.852 --> 20:38.184
where's your husband?

20:38.186 --> 20:41.053
What makes you think I have one?

20:41.488 --> 20:43.387
OK, where's your boyfriend?

20:44.223 --> 20:45.922
You ask a lot of questions to be so young.

20:45.924 --> 20:49.125
Where are your parents?
And how old are you?

20:49.127 --> 20:52.428
My parents are at home...
Where they belong.

20:52.430 --> 20:55.097
And how old do you think I am?

20:55.099 --> 20:57.265
25?

20:57.267 --> 20:58.499
Really?

21:01.103 --> 21:03.837
Well, I'll be 21 on my next birthday,

21:03.839 --> 21:04.904
so that makes me 20.

21:04.906 --> 21:07.172
He's not even legal.

21:07.174 --> 21:09.207
And you are?

21:09.209 --> 21:10.241
40.

21:10.243 --> 21:13.377
No, truthfully.

21:14.179 --> 21:17.046
Let's not go there, OK?

21:17.048 --> 21:19.815
You look really, really good.

21:19.817 --> 21:22.150
I mean, I never seen
a 40-year-old woman

21:22.152 --> 21:23.851
who looks like you.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.752
Thanks.

21:29.390 --> 21:31.289
So, what...

21:31.291 --> 21:34.358
what brings you here to Jamaica?

21:35.194 --> 21:37.160
I needed a vacation.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.427
What about you?

21:38.429 --> 21:39.528
Why are you here?

21:39.530 --> 21:41.930
I'm here staying with a friend of mine...

21:43.133 --> 21:44.465
who works at the resort.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.300
I just got my degree in biology,

21:46.302 --> 21:48.201
but I don't know what to do with it,

21:48.203 --> 21:50.870
so I'm here trying to land a summer job...

21:51.606 --> 21:53.839
possibly learn to be a chef.

21:56.342 --> 21:57.841
Winston, is it?

21:57.843 --> 21:58.908
Yes.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.409
That's nice.

22:00.411 --> 22:02.043
Wait...

22:02.045 --> 22:04.445
you haven't finished your breakfast yet.

22:04.447 --> 22:06.280
Yes, I have.

22:07.583 --> 22:08.548
OK...

22:08.550 --> 22:11.250
will you be going to the...

22:11.252 --> 22:13.318
the pajama disco tonight?

22:13.320 --> 22:14.419
The what?

22:14.421 --> 22:16.053
We wear our bed clothes and...

22:16.055 --> 22:19.056
we party. We dance.
We have a good time.

22:19.058 --> 22:21.358
You can't be serious.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.192
No, come on now.

22:22.194 --> 22:24.994
I mean, it's your first night in Jamaica.

22:24.996 --> 22:27.096
And to be honest...

22:27.598 --> 22:30.065
I would like to dance with you.

22:30.067 --> 22:32.500
No.
I don't think so.

22:35.371 --> 22:37.104
In case you haven't noticed, Winston,

22:37.106 --> 22:40.807
baby, I'm old enough to be your mother, OK?

22:41.976 --> 22:42.642
What?

22:42.644 --> 22:45.511
Nothing, I was just thinking about that.

22:45.513 --> 22:47.746
OK, so I'll meet you
there at 10:00. Cool?

22:47.748 --> 22:50.548
I... I don't think so.

22:50.550 --> 22:53.050
Well, I'll be there, anyway,

22:53.052 --> 22:54.384
watching the door,

22:54.386 --> 22:56.486
hoping you change your mind.

22:56.488 --> 22:58.454
Nice meeting you, Winston.

23:25.145 --> 23:26.010
Buddy, Jack,

23:26.012 --> 23:28.112
this is my best friend Stella.

23:28.114 --> 23:29.146
Hey, Stella.

23:29.148 --> 23:30.180
Say, baby.

23:30.182 --> 23:32.582
Now, I heard you was down here on the island

23:32.584 --> 23:35.351
looking for some real love.

23:35.353 --> 23:36.618
If that rumor's true,

23:36.620 --> 23:40.488
I am here to put the "P"
in paradise for you.

23:42.225 --> 23:45.426
Buddy, shut up and roll over.

23:45.761 --> 23:49.262
You... you t-tearing
that bathing suit up,

23:49.264 --> 23:50.663
Miss Delilah.

23:50.665 --> 23:51.630
Ain't I, though?

23:51.632 --> 23:53.231
I do look good, don't I?

23:53.233 --> 23:54.131
Baby.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.565
All right, then do mama's footsies,

23:55.567 --> 23:57.233
'cause they're aching.

23:58.202 --> 24:00.368
Listen, we going to Rick's Cafe tonight.

24:00.370 --> 24:01.569
They got the best lobster,

24:01.571 --> 24:03.203
the best sunsets on the island.

24:03.205 --> 24:04.337
What time you wanna go?

24:04.339 --> 24:06.405
You make sure you wear something

24:06.407 --> 24:08.006
that you can show off

24:08.008 --> 24:09.507
them beautiful brown shoulders of yours.

24:09.509 --> 24:11.775
Let me put a little sunblock on there.

24:11.777 --> 24:13.543
No, no, no.
Thank you, Buddy.

24:13.545 --> 24:15.077
That's all right.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.745
Aw...

24:17.647 --> 24:19.246
And as far as tonight goes,

24:19.248 --> 24:20.513
I don't think so.

24:20.515 --> 24:22.715
What you talking about?
You don't think so?

24:22.717 --> 24:26.085
It's our second night.
Don't dud up on me now.

24:26.087 --> 24:28.754
I'm feeling tired, D.

24:28.756 --> 24:29.621
From what?

24:29.623 --> 24:33.324
S-s-s-s-s-s-
s-swimming?

24:36.162 --> 24:39.096
I told you jogging wasn't
gonna do you any good

24:39.098 --> 24:40.430
here on the island.

24:40.432 --> 24:42.532
All you got to do is take a nap.

24:42.534 --> 24:43.733
You got all day.

24:43.735 --> 24:45.101
Bring me back a doggy bag.

24:45.103 --> 24:48.104
Am I crazy? Did I miss
something at breakfast?

24:48.106 --> 24:49.038
Yep.

24:49.040 --> 24:53.208
Waffles and red grapefruit.

24:53.210 --> 24:54.509
No, not that one.

24:54.511 --> 24:55.810
That's mama's heart shuttering.

24:55.812 --> 24:59.513
Give mama a heart attack,
you don't get none.

24:59.515 --> 25:01.281
I'm funny.

25:01.283 --> 25:03.483
Look at how cute he is.

25:03.485 --> 25:05.418
The teeth.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.819
That's good.
That's good.

25:07.821 --> 25:09.053
I know it's good.

25:09.055 --> 25:11.522
I'm gonna take him to the porn shop, OK?

25:12.525 --> 25:14.291
He don't even know what I'm talking 'bout.

25:14.293 --> 25:16.493
Yeah, that's good.

25:31.541 --> 25:33.107
I'm too old for this mess.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.536
I'm glad you came.

26:09.372 --> 26:11.305
But you're late.

26:12.641 --> 26:13.406
How can I be late

26:13.408 --> 26:17.476
to something I never said I was coming to?

26:17.478 --> 26:18.743
Well, I been waiting

26:18.745 --> 26:20.377
for you to walk through that door

26:20.379 --> 26:22.545
since a quarter
to 10:00.

26:31.322 --> 26:33.822
It's a very pretty nightgown.

26:33.824 --> 26:35.123
Thanks.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.692
I feel a little overdressed.

26:39.128 --> 26:40.694
Don't.

26:50.706 --> 26:52.372
Why don't you wrap that thing

26:52.374 --> 26:54.307
around your waist?

26:55.510 --> 26:58.310
Yeah. Thanks.

28:53.406 --> 28:54.972
Heh heh heh.

29:11.590 --> 29:12.655
S-say, man,

29:12.657 --> 29:15.457
what the fuck's
s-she doing with him?

29:24.567 --> 29:25.866
Hey!

29:25.868 --> 29:27.000
Hey!

29:27.002 --> 29:28.801
What are you doing?

29:28.803 --> 29:31.236
She's dancing with me.

29:31.805 --> 29:33.471
And who the hell are you?

29:33.473 --> 29:34.705
None of your business.

29:34.707 --> 29:35.972
Yes, it is my business, girl.

29:35.974 --> 29:38.307
We came here together, and then you ditch me

29:38.309 --> 29:40.042
to play with some
juvenile hip-hopper!

29:40.044 --> 29:41.743
Who you know nothing about.

29:41.745 --> 29:43.444
And you do?

29:45.014 --> 29:47.047
She knows she likes me.

29:47.049 --> 29:48.415
Isn't that right?

29:48.417 --> 29:51.584
Yes, Winston, that's right.

29:52.787 --> 29:54.720
Come on, girl!

29:54.722 --> 29:56.455
No! No! I'm gonna...

29:59.426 --> 30:02.593
I want you to meet
my friend Jack. Come on.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.595
I'm gonna see you later, girl!

30:05.597 --> 30:07.630
I'm gonna introduce her to Jack!

30:07.632 --> 30:10.766
Jack!
Jack, where are you?

30:34.957 --> 30:36.356
Hey!

30:36.358 --> 30:38.658
Does everybody wanna get crazy?

30:40.895 --> 30:43.028
Take it off, children!

30:43.030 --> 30:45.697
Take it all the way off!

31:08.453 --> 31:09.785
I can't do this.

31:09.787 --> 31:11.787
OK, OK. This way.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.488
Unh!

31:22.963 --> 31:25.997
G-g-g-g-get down,
man.

31:26.933 --> 31:29.767
Get down, man.
Get down.

31:39.577 --> 31:40.976
You're hot, man.

31:40.978 --> 31:43.511
You're really, really hot.

31:50.585 --> 31:53.652
This is too much competition for me.

31:53.654 --> 31:55.253
Is it too much for you?

31:55.255 --> 31:56.887
My very thought.

31:56.889 --> 31:57.821
Buddy...

31:57.823 --> 31:59.789
you too hot for me.

32:01.692 --> 32:02.590
Hey!

32:02.592 --> 32:03.991
Hey, where you going, man!
Come on back now!

32:03.993 --> 32:05.826
You only seen the half of it!

32:05.828 --> 32:06.960
Hey!

32:06.962 --> 32:08.895
Stella!

32:19.505 --> 32:20.103
Stella?

32:20.105 --> 32:22.205
Stella, open the door.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.739
I know you in there.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.941
I seen your little boyfriend downstairs

32:25.943 --> 32:28.176
sucking down burgers with his posse.

32:28.178 --> 32:29.810
Open the door.

32:30.712 --> 32:32.244
What do you want, slut?

32:32.246 --> 32:33.745
Who are you calling a slut?

32:33.747 --> 32:36.280
Trolling the kindergarten yards for a date.

32:36.282 --> 32:38.849
They gonna put your behind in jail for that.

32:38.851 --> 32:40.784
He's almost 21.

32:40.786 --> 32:43.052
Well, then it's almost not felony.

32:43.054 --> 32:45.020
What's his name?

32:45.022 --> 32:46.354
Winston.

32:46.356 --> 32:47.722
Winston.

32:48.891 --> 32:49.956
Yeah.

32:49.958 --> 32:50.990
You knew all day

32:50.992 --> 32:52.758
you was gonna see that
boy tonight, didn't you?

32:52.760 --> 32:55.260
And Buddy Bear's poor heart is broken?

32:55.262 --> 32:56.261
It is.

32:56.263 --> 32:59.264
He is. He's a broken man
because of you.

33:00.066 --> 33:01.632
But, honey, that boy is cute.

33:01.634 --> 33:03.967
Who, Mr. Jailbait
hip-hopper?

33:04.803 --> 33:06.736
I watched him dance for about 2 hours.

33:06.738 --> 33:09.872
If he moves that good with his clothes on...

33:10.808 --> 33:12.707
And y'all make a cute couple.

33:12.709 --> 33:15.109
Girl, all I did was dance with him.

33:15.111 --> 33:18.011
All night long.

33:18.013 --> 33:20.146
So, is that a problem?

33:20.148 --> 33:21.247
Well, it must be,

33:21.249 --> 33:22.982
'cause I'm here, and he ain't.

33:22.984 --> 33:24.950
Please.
I just unpacked.

33:24.952 --> 33:27.919
That, and you're chickenshit.

33:27.921 --> 33:29.220
Come on.
Don't be ridiculous.

33:29.222 --> 33:33.324
What in the world would I do
with a 20-year-old kid.

33:33.326 --> 33:34.291
Fuck him.

33:34.293 --> 33:37.260
Do the humpty hump.
Do the bumpty bump.

33:37.262 --> 33:38.294
Fuck him.

33:38.296 --> 33:39.128
Yeah!

33:39.130 --> 33:40.863
I'm old enough to be that boy's mama.

33:40.865 --> 33:42.130
That boy wasn't looking at you

33:42.132 --> 33:44.298
like you was old enough
to be his mother, girl.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.733
Look, Stella, we in Jamaica, girl.

33:46.735 --> 33:47.800
We are in Jamaica.

33:47.802 --> 33:50.169
Have an affair.
Have a fling.

33:51.005 --> 33:52.270
I'm not gonna tell if you don't.

33:52.272 --> 33:54.572
You need to get up and go to your room.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.140
I'm not going
to my room. No!

33:56.142 --> 33:57.207
You know what?

33:57.209 --> 33:59.842
I'm going... I'm taking me
and my big behind,

33:59.844 --> 34:02.177
and I'm laying down on the bed

34:02.179 --> 34:03.645
just like this.

34:03.647 --> 34:04.912
No, you ain't.

34:04.914 --> 34:06.013
Winnie.

34:06.015 --> 34:09.116
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

34:09.118 --> 34:10.217
Tsk.

34:11.219 --> 34:13.053
Move your butt over.

34:14.022 --> 34:16.222
And you better hush.
I don't wanna hear...

34:16.224 --> 34:18.190
I'm not saying a word.

34:18.192 --> 34:19.591
"Winston."

34:19.592 --> 34:20.925
Oop. Sorry.

34:23.696 --> 34:27.230
I know he is fine, but.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.799
I ain't studding that child.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.634
Liar.

34:54.121 --> 34:55.152
Winston.

34:55.155 --> 34:56.786
Look. Watch her.

35:18.339 --> 35:19.738
Hey.

35:19.740 --> 35:20.705
Winston,

35:20.707 --> 35:23.140
do me a favor and talk to me, please.

35:23.142 --> 35:24.441
Don't look...
What?

35:24.443 --> 35:25.942
But that old man coming this way

35:25.944 --> 35:28.878
is trying to hit on me.

35:31.649 --> 35:33.148
And who can blame him?

35:33.150 --> 35:34.749
You know, if I weren't in my right mind,

35:34.751 --> 35:36.851
I'd swear you were trying to hit on me, too.

35:36.853 --> 35:39.220
And you would be right.

35:39.822 --> 35:41.188
You're serious, aren't you?

35:41.190 --> 35:42.923
Very much so.

35:42.925 --> 35:44.724
So, what are you saying?

35:44.726 --> 35:47.359
That you would like to be intimate with me?

35:49.162 --> 35:52.830
Are you paying attention?

35:54.867 --> 35:56.633
OK.

36:00.739 --> 36:02.438
Y-y-you're not going
to change your mind

36:02.440 --> 36:04.039
at the last minute, now, are you?

36:04.041 --> 36:07.442
No. I'm not going
to change my mind,

36:07.444 --> 36:08.943
but I don't know what I'm doing,

36:08.945 --> 36:10.978
and I can't believe what I just said to you.

36:10.980 --> 36:13.180
I... this has got to be
illegal, you think?

36:13.182 --> 36:16.349
Wait. Now, why would you
say something like that?

36:16.351 --> 36:17.983
Boy, I'm old enough to be your...

36:17.985 --> 36:21.419
Why don't you just get it
out of your system right now?

36:21.421 --> 36:24.288
Tell me 3 million times how old we both are.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.922
That way, I won't have to hear it again

36:25.924 --> 36:28.357
for the rest of our lives.

36:28.359 --> 36:31.993
Or for the rest of the week.

36:31.995 --> 36:33.260
Yeah. What makes
you think

36:33.262 --> 36:35.729
you're going to last a week?

36:35.731 --> 36:37.464
I was just hoping.

38:17.344 --> 38:18.910
I'm sorry.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.380
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

38:22.382 --> 38:24.181
Excuse me.

39:31.648 --> 39:33.214
Gotcha.

40:39.510 --> 40:41.276
All right, so what you're telling me

40:41.278 --> 40:43.778
is that you don't really
have a passion for medicine.

40:43.780 --> 40:46.747
No. I... I want
to be a doctor.

40:46.749 --> 40:49.216
I do. My father
is a surgeon.

40:50.219 --> 40:53.420
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what
your meaning of passion is.

40:53.422 --> 40:56.790
I mean that your desire
for it is that strong.

40:56.792 --> 40:58.258
I mean you'd rather do that

40:58.260 --> 41:00.693
more than anything else in the world.

41:00.695 --> 41:03.595
I feel that way about you.

41:04.230 --> 41:07.431
So, are you going to med school?

41:08.300 --> 41:11.434
I postponed medical school,

41:11.436 --> 41:12.768
and, needless to say,

41:12.770 --> 41:15.604
my father was a bit upset at first.

41:15.606 --> 41:16.805
Yes...

41:16.807 --> 41:18.573
but then he realized that it was your life,

41:18.575 --> 41:22.643
and he told you to take all
the time you needed, right?

41:22.645 --> 41:23.777
How did you know that?

41:23.779 --> 41:26.412
Because my mama told me the same thing.

41:26.414 --> 41:28.380
I think it's in the parents' handbook...

41:28.382 --> 41:32.617
Let your children go and find their way.

41:32.619 --> 41:33.818
Yeah.

41:34.687 --> 41:37.120
My mama always thought that I'd be the one

41:37.122 --> 41:38.788
who'd make it out of the projects,

41:38.790 --> 41:40.523
make something of myself...

41:40.525 --> 41:44.126
Which pretty much came
down to a lot of money,

41:44.128 --> 41:45.293
but I had other ideas.

41:45.295 --> 41:47.828
I wanted to make furniture, you know?

41:47.830 --> 41:49.095
Furniture?

41:49.097 --> 41:51.197
But in the end,

41:51.199 --> 41:54.633
I wound up just where she wanted me to...

41:54.635 --> 41:56.501
In the money markets.

41:56.736 --> 42:00.437
Tell me more about the furniture.

42:01.373 --> 42:04.640
You don't have to act interested in that.

42:04.642 --> 42:09.244
If I wasn't interested,
then I wouldn't ask you.

42:13.449 --> 42:16.082
An idea would come to me in a dream...

42:16.818 --> 42:20.386
and I would jump up and
run straight to the garage.

42:21.622 --> 42:22.721
Shoot.

42:22.723 --> 42:27.559
I think I was just about your age then.

42:27.561 --> 42:28.860
And I would sit,

42:28.862 --> 42:33.531
and I'd play in my pajamas until daylight.

42:36.302 --> 42:38.402
Sometimes you don't know

42:38.404 --> 42:42.305
what your life is going to turn out like...

42:42.307 --> 42:45.141
Not even when you plan it.

42:47.945 --> 42:50.712
You can't always plan everything.

42:54.550 --> 42:56.349
You can try.

42:59.854 --> 43:02.688
You don't make furniture anymore?

43:03.657 --> 43:05.256
No.

43:07.226 --> 43:08.558
Why?

43:11.663 --> 43:14.830
I make money instead.

44:04.581 --> 44:06.247
Hey.
Hi.

44:06.249 --> 44:07.248
You look nice.

44:07.250 --> 44:09.984
Thank you.
You're early.

44:09.986 --> 44:12.353
Yeah, well...

44:12.355 --> 44:13.287
I got hired at Windswept.

44:13.289 --> 44:18.292
Yeah, man. Assistant
to the head chef.

44:18.294 --> 44:19.226
That's great.

44:19.228 --> 44:21.228
Well, that's what you came here for.

44:21.230 --> 44:22.295
So, when do you start?

44:22.297 --> 44:25.331
That's the thing.
I start immediately.

44:25.333 --> 44:28.801
I have a meeting with
the boss in about an hour,

44:28.803 --> 44:32.237
so I have to push off.

44:35.442 --> 44:38.910
I am really, really sorry.

44:38.912 --> 44:40.444
I thought I was going to spend

44:40.446 --> 44:43.547
all day and all night with you,

44:43.549 --> 44:44.581
but...

44:44.583 --> 44:47.884
Well, what time do you get off tonight?

44:47.886 --> 44:49.452
I have to work tonight

44:49.454 --> 44:53.789
and tomorrow, and I'm on call
for the rest of the week.

44:53.791 --> 44:54.856
See, someone got fired,

44:54.858 --> 44:57.925
and then I got hired at the last minute.

44:57.927 --> 44:59.927
Look, Winston,

44:59.929 --> 45:00.994
it's been fun.

45:00.996 --> 45:04.630
And the next time I'm in Jamaica,

45:04.632 --> 45:06.565
and I want to play these high school games,

45:06.567 --> 45:09.267
I'll call you first.

45:09.736 --> 45:11.836
Stella, I want to see you before you leave.

45:11.838 --> 45:12.736
Why?

45:12.738 --> 45:14.671
Because I have to.

45:15.740 --> 45:18.574
Now, I get 2 hours free time each evening.

45:18.576 --> 45:20.442
2 whole free hours?

45:20.444 --> 45:23.344
Wow. I mean, don't strain
yourself, Winston.

45:23.346 --> 45:24.812
Let's just...

45:30.352 --> 45:33.286
Let's just say
good-bye now.

45:33.288 --> 45:33.753
No.

45:33.755 --> 45:38.324
I can find time to see you before you leave.

45:38.326 --> 45:40.726
I know it.

45:40.728 --> 45:42.761
Please.

45:42.763 --> 45:44.462
Tsk.

45:45.498 --> 45:46.997
Serious?
Yeah. OK.

45:46.999 --> 45:48.565
Yeah.

45:50.868 --> 45:52.434
OK.

45:55.672 --> 45:56.971
OK.

46:15.324 --> 46:17.757
You think you got played?

46:17.759 --> 46:20.793
Let's not go there.

46:22.530 --> 46:24.029
Isn't this beautiful?

46:24.031 --> 46:26.031
What you mean, let's not go there?

46:26.033 --> 46:27.532
You already there.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.799
Look at you, lip hanging down.

46:28.801 --> 46:31.735
You're pouting, which
I ain't seen in 20 years.

46:31.737 --> 46:33.703
I am not pouting.

46:33.705 --> 46:34.870
I'm pissed.

46:34.872 --> 46:36.471
Outraged is more like it.

46:36.473 --> 46:38.372
Yeah, behind
a 20-year-old kid.

46:38.374 --> 46:40.006
Would you feel better if he was 40?

46:40.008 --> 46:42.008
Well, at least I'd have some dignity.

46:42.010 --> 46:45.044
I wouldn't feel like
some desperate old broad.

46:45.046 --> 46:48.847
I got to ask you one question.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.748
Was it good?

46:52.418 --> 46:54.484
Better than that.

46:56.554 --> 46:58.020
Return the man's phone calls.

46:58.022 --> 46:59.021
No.

46:59.023 --> 47:01.923
No. It's over.
It was just one night.

47:01.925 --> 47:05.559
Return the man's phone calls.

47:05.561 --> 47:08.361
Listen, you are not fooling anybody,

47:08.363 --> 47:10.896
especially not me.

47:27.915 --> 47:29.648
God's here.

47:38.091 --> 47:40.858
Good morning, Castle Beach Hotel and Resort.

47:40.860 --> 47:42.659
May I help you?

47:53.638 --> 47:54.570
Hello?

47:54.572 --> 47:58.140
Yes, Winston Shakespeare, please?

47:58.142 --> 48:00.575
Winston!

48:00.577 --> 48:01.709
I'm sorry.
He's not here.

48:01.711 --> 48:03.510
Do you expect him soon?

48:03.512 --> 48:08.147
I can't say. I can take
a message if you like.

48:08.149 --> 48:11.150
No, that's OK.

48:11.152 --> 48:12.818
Thanks.

48:46.586 --> 48:48.852
Lord.

48:53.658 --> 48:54.657
Finally.

48:54.659 --> 48:57.760
Well, first of all, welcome back, slut.

48:57.762 --> 49:00.062
I'd say that was a pretty
accurate description.

49:00.064 --> 49:01.696
Can I at least get into the house

49:01.698 --> 49:04.031
without coming home to the instant bullshit?

49:04.033 --> 49:04.798
Next trip.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.568
I'm sorry, but Miss FBI agent over here

49:08.570 --> 49:09.802
grilled me so long and hard,

49:09.804 --> 49:10.903
I had to tell her.

49:10.905 --> 49:13.605
Whatever. Can you at least
help me with the bag?

49:13.607 --> 49:15.540
Well, I got some good news,

49:15.542 --> 49:16.641
and I got a little bit of bad news.

49:16.643 --> 49:18.075
What? It's not
Quincy, is it?

49:18.077 --> 49:18.942
No.

49:18.944 --> 49:19.809
If it was Quincy,

49:19.811 --> 49:21.477
you were on the other side
of the world partying,

49:21.479 --> 49:24.112
so what would you have done if it was?

49:24.114 --> 49:25.680
Hello, Angela.

49:25.682 --> 49:29.183
Plus, I hear you're a cradle robber,

49:29.185 --> 49:32.119
so you probably have a hard time

49:32.121 --> 49:33.186
keeping the children straight.

49:33.188 --> 49:35.621
Now, you didn't have to go there, Angela.

49:35.623 --> 49:36.922
Not at all.

49:36.924 --> 49:38.623
Whatever.
No, then again...

49:38.625 --> 49:40.658
Girl, I love these braids.

49:40.660 --> 49:42.694
You look like a real hootchy mama.

49:42.696 --> 49:44.028
Don't say another word, Angela.

49:44.030 --> 49:45.262
Yeah. You'll be
delivering

49:45.264 --> 49:46.263
in this driveway.

49:46.265 --> 49:48.331
Don't start with me.

49:48.333 --> 49:50.800
Well, anyway, before you get too pissed,

49:50.802 --> 49:52.101
they're about to cut off my cable

49:52.103 --> 49:54.002
and snatch back my Nordstrom's card

49:54.004 --> 49:54.902
if I don't pay,

49:54.904 --> 49:56.336
because you know
Chantel's day-late daddy

49:56.338 --> 49:57.737
is late again with the check.

49:57.739 --> 50:00.906
So, basically, can I borrow about $300

50:00.908 --> 50:02.407
until whenever?

50:02.409 --> 50:04.308
So, what's the good news?

50:04.310 --> 50:06.209
Did I say there was some good news?

50:06.211 --> 50:06.909
Yes.

50:06.911 --> 50:09.311
I'm still beautiful.

50:09.313 --> 50:10.845
Well, beautiful one,

50:10.847 --> 50:13.948
did you feed Phoenix and
Chester, or are they dead?

50:13.950 --> 50:15.783
Don't worry.
It's still Wild Kingdom

50:15.785 --> 50:17.151
up in there.

50:17.953 --> 50:19.185
But the bad news is,

50:19.187 --> 50:21.620
I had a little baby accident in your car,

50:21.622 --> 50:22.921
but it wasn't my fault, Stella!

50:22.923 --> 50:25.590
Stella, this woman came out of nowhere

50:25.592 --> 50:28.125
making a left turn out of the right lane.

50:28.127 --> 50:29.326
Can you believe that?

50:29.328 --> 50:30.760
Did anyone get hurt?

50:30.762 --> 50:31.594
No.

50:31.596 --> 50:34.763
Thank goodness.

50:35.332 --> 50:37.365
Why come you're not acting pissed?

50:37.367 --> 50:41.068
Vanessa, it's just
a thing... a stupid car.

50:41.070 --> 50:41.935
It can be fixed.

50:41.937 --> 50:45.605
Wait a minute, Stella.

50:46.174 --> 50:48.374
That young boy must have
put something on your ass.

50:48.376 --> 50:49.842
What happened to you?

50:49.844 --> 50:50.342
Nothing.

50:50.344 --> 50:52.010
Did you go down there and fall in love

50:52.012 --> 50:53.945
with a 20-year-old boy?

50:53.947 --> 50:55.780
Are you crazy?

50:55.782 --> 50:59.784
How could you stoop so low?

50:59.786 --> 51:02.219
And I want to know

51:02.221 --> 51:03.987
how low did you go?

51:03.989 --> 51:05.088
Look at you.
You're glowing and shit.

51:05.090 --> 51:08.925
You know, you ain't got
the sense God gave you.

51:08.927 --> 51:09.959
All I've got to say

51:09.961 --> 51:11.794
is thank God it was just a little fling,

51:11.796 --> 51:13.162
and you're not seeing him again.

51:13.164 --> 51:16.231
And you should be ashamed of yourself

51:16.233 --> 51:17.165
for being so desperate.

51:17.167 --> 51:20.368
You need to take your pregnant behind home

51:20.370 --> 51:21.268
right now,

51:21.270 --> 51:22.836
because you could spoil a wet dream.

51:22.838 --> 51:25.104
For your information,
I'm not completely stupid,

51:25.106 --> 51:26.905
nor have I committed any crime.

51:26.907 --> 51:30.108
All I did was sleep with him.

51:30.110 --> 51:31.843
Damn!

51:31.845 --> 51:34.712
Yeah, and I want to hear

51:34.714 --> 51:37.081
all the juicy details
blow-by-blow,

51:37.083 --> 51:40.217
but I gots to go, so call me in the car.

52:03.974 --> 52:07.275
Hi.

52:07.277 --> 52:10.911
Isaac, what's going on around here?

52:10.913 --> 52:13.146
Are we moving and no one
bothered to tell me?

52:13.148 --> 52:16.149
I'm at a loss.
Files are missing from my desk.

52:16.151 --> 52:19.252
I didn't authorize access.
I can't log on to my computer.

52:19.254 --> 52:22.455
Has the system crashed?
Talk to me.

52:22.457 --> 52:23.756
Sit down, Stella.

52:23.758 --> 52:26.258
I don't feel like sitting.
Just tell me what's going on.

52:26.260 --> 52:30.362
Look, our numbers are down.
We've had 3 rough quarters.

52:30.364 --> 52:32.831
The merger
with Thorsen-Bendett...

52:32.833 --> 52:33.998
Jerry went for it.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.867
To avoid a redundancy at the upper levels,

52:36.869 --> 52:39.769
it's one of ours, one of theirs.

52:39.771 --> 52:42.304
Carl Amundsun has your spot, Stella.

52:42.306 --> 52:46.408
I know they plan to offer
you an excellent package.

52:53.016 --> 52:54.915
You think I'd fall for that?

52:54.917 --> 52:57.450
I built this division. I made
millions for this company.

52:57.452 --> 52:59.985
You think I'd accept some golden parachute

52:59.987 --> 53:01.853
and drop back into my hole?

53:01.855 --> 53:04.088
You've known me longer than that, Isaac.

53:04.090 --> 53:06.390
You tell them they'd
better make it platinum!

53:06.392 --> 53:09.426
And even then, I may sue their sorry asses.

53:09.428 --> 53:10.960
I understand how you feel.

53:10.962 --> 53:13.329
I didn't want this, but what could I do?

53:13.331 --> 53:15.064
Nothing, I expect.

53:15.066 --> 53:19.768
Too busy making sure your spot
didn't become one of theirs.

53:28.011 --> 53:30.378
Don't forget, I got over 3,000

53:30.380 --> 53:32.079
in my bank savings if you need it.

53:32.081 --> 53:35.882
Thank you, baby, but mama
put away a little something

53:35.884 --> 53:38.017
for a rainy day, so don't worry.

53:38.019 --> 53:40.319
Don't you feel bad about being fired?

53:40.321 --> 53:41.486
I'd be pissed.

53:41.488 --> 53:43.120
You'd be what?

53:43.122 --> 53:44.821
I'd sure be mad as hell.

53:44.823 --> 53:46.088
Quincy.

53:46.090 --> 53:47.956
Sorry, Mom.

53:49.025 --> 53:50.224
Remember how you felt

53:50.226 --> 53:52.960
when you didn't make
the all-star team?

53:52.962 --> 53:54.828
Mom, don't go there.

53:54.830 --> 53:57.397
That's what losing my job feels like.

53:57.399 --> 54:00.967
Well, but things happen for a reason.

54:00.969 --> 54:03.102
We'll see.

54:03.104 --> 54:05.070
I understand.

54:05.072 --> 54:07.072
Well, I hope this makes you feel better.

54:07.074 --> 54:11.176
You always make me feel better.

54:11.178 --> 54:12.944
Grace.

54:13.413 --> 54:15.980
God is great, God is good,
thank you for our food.

54:15.982 --> 54:17.548
Amen. Praise the Lord.

54:17.550 --> 54:17.948
Amen.

54:17.950 --> 54:21.084
So, did you have fun in Jamaica or what?

54:21.086 --> 54:23.953
I did indeed..

54:23.955 --> 54:25.087
Here. Check these out.

54:25.089 --> 54:28.790
All the places I went to when I was there.

54:28.792 --> 54:31.058
Wow.

54:31.060 --> 54:32.225
Mom?

54:32.994 --> 54:34.393
Since you don't have a job now,

54:34.395 --> 54:36.928
think it's possible to take
a family bonding vacation

54:36.930 --> 54:39.163
in Jamaica this summer instead of Africa?

54:39.165 --> 54:41.999
Quincy, now, we have to be sensible.

54:42.001 --> 54:43.900
We may not be broke, OK?

54:43.902 --> 54:47.036
But I gotta find a new job,
deal with these lawyers.

54:47.038 --> 54:49.405
I have a lot on my plate right now.

54:49.407 --> 54:51.907
You understand?

54:51.909 --> 54:54.142
Yeah.

55:15.296 --> 55:17.496
Hello?

55:18.365 --> 55:19.997
Who's this?

55:21.300 --> 55:22.866
One moment, please.

55:22.868 --> 55:23.933
Mom.

55:23.935 --> 55:24.900
Yeah, what?

55:24.902 --> 55:27.936
Some guy named Winston,
and he has an accent.

55:27.938 --> 55:30.571
Winston?

55:30.573 --> 55:31.505
Hello?

55:31.507 --> 55:33.406
Hello, Stella.

55:33.408 --> 55:37.143
Wow.
What a nice surprise.

55:37.145 --> 55:38.911
How'd you get my number?

55:38.913 --> 55:41.079
Your friend Delilah gave it to me

55:41.081 --> 55:42.980
when I came to look for you.

55:42.982 --> 55:45.615
I, I wanted
to say good-bye.

55:45.617 --> 55:47.883
She gave you my number?

55:47.885 --> 55:48.583
Yeah.

55:48.585 --> 55:50.518
She doesn't know you.
How much you pay her?

55:50.520 --> 55:53.354
Everything I had, plus an IOU.

55:53.356 --> 55:56.123
I tried to call you,

55:56.125 --> 55:57.924
but you weren't there.

55:57.926 --> 55:59.358
I've been thinking about you.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.559
Really?

56:01.428 --> 56:04.562
No, you haven't.
I miss you, Stella.

56:04.564 --> 56:06.864
No, you don't.

56:06.866 --> 56:09.433
Could you hold for a minute?

56:09.435 --> 56:11.435
Yeah.

56:13.372 --> 56:16.072
Hoo!!

56:18.643 --> 56:22.544
Hi. I'm back.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.212
So, when we just left off,

56:24.214 --> 56:27.615
you were getting into
how much you missed me.

56:27.617 --> 56:30.884
I, I wrote you a letter,

56:30.886 --> 56:34.554
but I was a little afraid to send it.

56:34.556 --> 56:36.222
Fax it to me.

56:36.224 --> 56:38.357
I want to see you, Stella.

56:38.359 --> 56:41.526
Why don't you come to the point?

56:41.528 --> 56:45.129
Look, Winston, I really don't
see how that's possible.

56:45.131 --> 56:48.532
Well, in 3 months, I can take a sick leave.

56:51.370 --> 56:54.604
Well, maybe I can arrange something.

56:54.606 --> 56:57.640
I did promise Quincy
I'd bring him to Jamaica.

56:57.642 --> 57:00.409
Yes, Mom!
How soon?

57:00.411 --> 57:02.377
Can Chantel come, too?

57:02.379 --> 57:04.979
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

57:04.981 --> 57:06.513
Let me think about it,

57:06.515 --> 57:09.148
and I'll call you back with the details.

57:09.150 --> 57:11.250
Stella, when you come,

57:11.252 --> 57:14.253
could you bring me some junk food?

57:14.255 --> 57:15.220
Junk food?

57:15.222 --> 57:20.658
Yeah. I need Snickers,
Ho-Hos, Oreos,

57:20.660 --> 57:23.427
and the Cocoa Puffs.

57:23.429 --> 57:25.395
What are you gonna do for me?

57:25.397 --> 57:28.097
I'll think of something.

57:28.099 --> 57:28.997
You do that.

57:28.999 --> 57:31.599
All right, I'll call you back tonight.

57:31.601 --> 57:33.701
I can't wait.

57:33.703 --> 57:36.336
Bye.

57:36.338 --> 57:38.504
Bye-bye.

58:18.712 --> 58:20.278
Stella!

58:21.481 --> 58:25.049
Hey!

58:28.421 --> 58:31.155
Who's that guy with Auntie Stell?

58:31.157 --> 58:32.222
That's her new boyfriend

58:32.224 --> 58:34.191
she had to come all this way to find.

58:34.193 --> 58:36.660
She couldn't find one in America.

58:36.662 --> 58:38.561
He's also very young.

58:38.563 --> 58:40.329
How young is he?

58:41.598 --> 58:42.763
Not quite 30.

58:42.765 --> 58:45.332
That's not young.

58:45.334 --> 58:46.766
Sure is cute.

58:46.768 --> 58:49.668
Well, as you can see, he's already taken.

58:49.670 --> 58:51.736
Marco!

58:51.738 --> 58:52.870
Polo.

58:52.872 --> 58:55.339
Hey, you guys.

58:55.341 --> 58:58.241
I want you to meet someone.

58:58.243 --> 58:59.775
What do you say, Quincy?

58:59.777 --> 59:01.576
Hi.

59:01.578 --> 59:03.144
How you doin'?

59:03.146 --> 59:05.646
And you must be Chanel.

59:05.648 --> 59:07.180
It's Chantel. Hi.

59:07.182 --> 59:13.085
Excuse me, Chantel.
Very nice to meet you.

59:17.257 --> 59:20.524
Well, Miss Stella Payne...

59:21.460 --> 59:26.596
Welcome back to Jamaica.

59:26.598 --> 59:28.164
Marco!

59:29.367 --> 59:31.400
Polo.
Polo.

59:31.402 --> 59:33.268
Polo.
Polo.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.902
Polo, polo, polo.

59:34.904 --> 59:36.637
Marco!

59:38.540 --> 59:40.339
Be careful, you guys.

59:40.341 --> 59:42.140
OK!
Look sharp.

59:42.142 --> 59:44.842
Wow, this place is full.

59:56.722 --> 59:58.221
What can I get ya?

59:58.223 --> 59:59.755
A ting, please.

59:59.757 --> 01:00:01.790
A ting.

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:03.258
And for you?

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.493
Me want the same thing.

01:00:05.495 --> 01:00:08.762
Well, your son sure favors you a lot.

01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:14.600
He really takes after his daddy.

01:00:14.602 --> 01:00:15.667
No.

01:00:15.669 --> 01:00:19.337
He's grown so much since
the last time I saw him.

01:00:19.339 --> 01:00:20.471
How long's that been?

01:00:20.473 --> 01:00:22.639
A year.
Say about...

01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:26.242
His dad and I divorced 4 years ago.

01:00:26.244 --> 01:00:27.910
That's sad.

01:00:27.912 --> 01:00:30.512
But a lot of that's going around.

01:00:31.748 --> 01:00:37.651
Well, you sure look happy to see your mum.

01:00:39.588 --> 01:00:40.920
Yeah, man.

01:00:43.624 --> 01:00:46.758
Let me show you how happy I am.

01:00:55.835 --> 01:00:57.401
What's her problem?

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.503
I don't know.
Let's dance.

01:00:59.505 --> 01:01:00.904
Cool.

01:01:07.779 --> 01:01:09.278
Come on.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.612
I quit my job.

01:01:10.614 --> 01:01:13.481
You look like you're apologizing for it.

01:01:13.483 --> 01:01:16.517
Well, I don't want you to think that...

01:01:16.519 --> 01:01:19.653
that I'm frivolous.

01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.588
I tell you what.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.489
I quit mine, too.

01:01:23.491 --> 01:01:25.991
Yeah. Right after
they fired me.

01:01:25.993 --> 01:01:28.526
What? Are you OK?

01:01:28.528 --> 01:01:30.694
Yes and no.

01:01:30.696 --> 01:01:32.328
I'm getting some good legal advice

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.929
so I may even come out ahead.

01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:36.865
I'm not talking about the money.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.766
No?

01:01:38.768 --> 01:01:43.604
I mean, if my father couldn't
practice medicine anymore,

01:01:43.606 --> 01:01:48.875
boy, the man would not know
what to do with himself.

01:01:48.877 --> 01:01:53.579
It would be as if someone
just took away his...

01:01:53.581 --> 01:01:56.615
his identity.

01:01:56.617 --> 01:02:00.518
So don't try and pretend
like it's not a big deal

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.953
because I know that it is.

01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:06.389
Well, I...

01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:09.058
I feel betrayed, if you
want to know the truth.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.061
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford

01:02:12.063 --> 01:02:16.432
to just go crazy about it, could I?

01:02:16.434 --> 01:02:19.001
Yes, you can.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:32.681
I will do your worrying for you tonight...

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.884
So hush.

01:02:46.794 --> 01:02:47.659
Yeah?

01:02:47.661 --> 01:02:50.928
Have you let that boy up for some air yet?

01:02:52.031 --> 01:02:55.465
Let me talk to him. I know
he's buried up under there.

01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.467
Winnie, can you hear me, baby?

01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:58.568
Shut up.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.670
He's on a banana boat with the kids.

01:03:00.672 --> 01:03:03.506
What took you so long to
return my call, Bertha?

01:03:03.508 --> 01:03:05.674
I could be down here losing my mind,

01:03:05.676 --> 01:03:08.343
and you wouldn't know it.

01:03:08.345 --> 01:03:09.344
How you doing?

01:03:09.346 --> 01:03:11.679
I've had better days,
but I'm not gonna waste

01:03:11.681 --> 01:03:14.381
this very expensive phone call
talking about me, Miss Thing.

01:03:14.383 --> 01:03:17.450
For a girl who lost her job,
you sound awfully chipper.

01:03:17.452 --> 01:03:18.751
I must say, I love it, though.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:22.387
Yeah. I should be ashamed
of myself down here

01:03:22.389 --> 01:03:24.689
acting like some lovesick college girl.

01:03:24.691 --> 01:03:26.657
We P.M.Sing now?

01:03:26.659 --> 01:03:28.425
No, we are not.

01:03:28.427 --> 01:03:30.560
Haven't you ever done something so crazy

01:03:30.562 --> 01:03:32.028
you had to keep it to yourself?

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.431
Yeah, but I can't remember
none of their names.

01:03:35.433 --> 01:03:36.999
I didn't used to be this crazy.

01:03:37.001 --> 01:03:39.034
I beg to differ with you, darling.

01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:42.003
Yeah, I just had to open my big mouth.

01:03:42.005 --> 01:03:44.038
"You want to be
intimate with me?"

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.541
Well, you opened it so wide,
I saw you on Hard Copy.

01:03:47.543 --> 01:03:48.942
You looked good, though.

01:03:48.944 --> 01:03:51.945
Hush up, girl. I'm
trying to be serious.

01:03:51.947 --> 01:03:55.448
Life is too short for us
to be bullshitting ourselves.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:58.617
We've had this conversation
4 or 5 times now,

01:03:58.619 --> 01:04:00.518
and for the last time, I'm asking you,

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.020
what is wrong with you
liking this young man?

01:04:03.022 --> 01:04:08.725
D, he doesn't get it.

01:04:08.727 --> 01:04:10.993
He's just a kid, you know?

01:04:11.996 --> 01:04:14.429
He hasn't been anywhere,
he hasn't done anything,

01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:16.097
he can't even buy me a drink.

01:04:16.099 --> 01:04:18.032
He don't know the first thing about...

01:04:18.034 --> 01:04:22.136
Hell, D, he hasn't even
had his heart broken.

01:04:22.138 --> 01:04:25.906
And this morning I found
Cocoa Puffs in the bed.

01:04:25.908 --> 01:04:30.977
Cocoa Puffs? Girl.
Young and innovative.

01:04:32.914 --> 01:04:34.046
Yaah!

01:04:34.048 --> 01:04:36.648
I don't know whether I'm coming or going.

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:38.149
Look, that's a good thing,

01:04:38.151 --> 01:04:40.151
'cause it means you ain't gonna get bored.

01:04:40.153 --> 01:04:43.521
Know what I mean?
You ain't gonna get bored.

01:04:43.523 --> 01:04:47.124
Now, if you are done
with this week's episode

01:04:47.126 --> 01:04:49.159
of <i> The Young, Restless,</i> and Colored,

01:04:49.161 --> 01:04:52.962
I gotta go. I got folks
waiting on me.

01:04:52.964 --> 01:04:56.131
Give my godson a big old kiss for me

01:04:56.133 --> 01:04:58.466
and take one for you, too.

01:04:58.468 --> 01:04:59.834
I love you, Stell.

01:04:59.836 --> 01:05:02.036
Yeah. You, too.

01:05:02.038 --> 01:05:04.605
Bye.

01:05:35.638 --> 01:05:36.637
OK.

01:05:36.639 --> 01:05:41.408
All right. Yeah.

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:44.243
See those horses?

01:05:44.245 --> 01:05:46.778
Wow.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.146
This is beautiful.

01:05:48.148 --> 01:05:50.948
Yeah. Very spacious.
Hey, man.

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.683
It doesn't look like a restaurant.

01:05:52.685 --> 01:05:56.186
That's because it's my folks' place.

01:05:56.188 --> 01:05:57.887
Winston, you didn't tell me.

01:05:57.889 --> 01:05:59.121
I wanted It to be a surprise.

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:01.923
I'll bet you did. I don't
like surprises like this.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:03.024
Look at me.

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.125
You look beautiful.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.594
Your mother's gonna think
I look like a hooker.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.028
Relax, please.

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.701
Hey. What's up?

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.703
You look beautiful.

01:06:17.705 --> 01:06:19.104
Mummy, Daddy...

01:06:19.106 --> 01:06:21.673
I would like you to meet Stella.

01:06:21.675 --> 01:06:22.240
Hi.

01:06:22.242 --> 01:06:25.209
Stella, very nice to meet you.

01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:27.578
Thank you.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.681
Hungry?

01:06:30.683 --> 01:06:32.082
A little.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:35.218
And are those your teenagers?

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.819
No... yes.

01:06:36.821 --> 01:06:39.254
My son's 11, and so's my niece.

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:43.458
I'll go get them.
Excuse me.

01:06:45.028 --> 01:06:47.028
Well, Stella...

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:50.765
allow me to show you our home.

01:06:50.767 --> 01:06:52.199
OK.

01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:01.540
To ride the horse 'cause she's so wild.

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:03.942
So, I'm gonna ride her.

01:07:03.944 --> 01:07:05.143
What happened?

01:07:05.145 --> 01:07:07.011
She threw me, of course.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.279
Why you laughing?

01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:12.815
I'll get it for you, ma'am.

01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:14.983
Can I help?

01:07:14.985 --> 01:07:18.019
No. The workers
can handle it.

01:07:18.021 --> 01:07:20.955
On second thought, come in.

01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:22.122
Sit.

01:07:22.124 --> 01:07:24.757
OK.

01:07:27.595 --> 01:07:29.861
It's a lovely table.

01:07:29.863 --> 01:07:30.862
Thank you.

01:07:30.864 --> 01:07:35.733
I could beat around the bush,
but it's not my style.

01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:40.003
So, how old are you, Stella?

01:07:40.005 --> 01:07:41.705
I'm 40.

01:07:41.707 --> 01:07:44.074
I'm 41.

01:07:44.776 --> 01:07:47.042
Are you American women
so desperate these days

01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:50.011
that you can't find a man your own age?

01:07:50.013 --> 01:07:51.112
No.

01:07:51.114 --> 01:07:55.616
Then what could you
possibly want with my baby?

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:58.417
He's not a baby.

01:07:58.419 --> 01:08:01.286
He's my baby.

01:08:01.288 --> 01:08:05.323
And you should be ashamed of yourself.

01:08:15.902 --> 01:08:16.734
Hey.

01:08:16.736 --> 01:08:20.069
I have never been so humiliated in my life.

01:08:20.072 --> 01:08:21.304
Easy now...

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:24.740
I think you're overreacting just a little?

01:08:24.742 --> 01:08:26.975
I mean, I can understand, you know.

01:08:26.977 --> 01:08:29.377
My mum can be a bit difficult at times...

01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:31.045
She called me desperate.

01:08:31.046 --> 01:08:33.279
Said I should be ashamed of myself.

01:08:33.282 --> 01:08:37.350
OK. Yeah. All right,
I apologize.

01:08:37.352 --> 01:08:41.319
I mean, you know, that was out of line.

01:08:41.322 --> 01:08:43.388
I just wanted you to meet my family.

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:46.991
What made you think I was
ready to meet your parents?

01:08:46.993 --> 01:08:49.993
I wanted them to know
how important you are to me.

01:08:49.996 --> 01:08:53.263
But you could have asked me
how I felt about it.

01:08:53.265 --> 01:08:54.831
Did that occur to you?

01:08:54.832 --> 01:08:56.365
I thought you'd be proud to meet them.

01:08:56.367 --> 01:08:59.067
You know, it's not about your parents.

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:01.969
It's about the immature way
in which you handled it.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.971
"Immature way"?

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.407
Now you're gonna scold me
like some school child?

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:09.809
You're behaving like one, wouldn't you say?

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:14.046
You didn't think I act like
such a child last night.

01:09:14.048 --> 01:09:15.046
Stop it.

01:09:15.049 --> 01:09:20.452
You know, this whole scene
is getting on my nerves.

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:21.986
Cool.

01:09:21.988 --> 01:09:23.187
No problem.

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:25.055
I'll take you back to the hotel.

01:09:25.057 --> 01:09:28.124
I think we're finished here.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.932
I don't want to go swimming!

01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:38.765
Why not?

01:09:38.768 --> 01:09:40.868
I want to play soccer.
Swimming's stupid.

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:43.069
Whatever, man.

01:09:54.849 --> 01:09:57.482
Hey, Winston. Come on,
we're gonna play soccer.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.383
No. Not right now.

01:10:04.488 --> 01:10:05.920
New York Hope.

01:10:05.922 --> 01:10:08.989
Yes, Dr. Steinberg,
please.

01:10:10.258 --> 01:10:12.124
This is
Dr. Steinberg.

01:10:12.126 --> 01:10:14.359
Yes. Stella Payne
returning your call,

01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:16.794
although I'm not sure why you called me.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:20.831
Your friend Delilah Abraham had
your name down as next of kin.

01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:22.833
What do you mean?

01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:24.868
Next of kin for what?

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:29.239
Whenever there's a problem,
we notify the closest relative.

01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:32.075
What kind of problem are you talking about?

01:10:32.077 --> 01:10:33.876
I'm sorry to have to tell you,

01:10:33.878 --> 01:10:36.478
but Ms. Abraham is facing
a medical emergency.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.378
A what?

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.946
During surgery this morning,

01:10:38.948 --> 01:10:43.183
we found Ms. Abraham's cancer
had advanced to her liver.

01:10:44.052 --> 01:10:46.252
She's been in the hospital
for the past 2 weeks.

01:10:46.254 --> 01:10:48.320
I thought you were aware of it.

01:10:48.322 --> 01:10:51.189
No. I... I wasn't.

01:10:51.191 --> 01:10:53.457
She told me she talked to you.

01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:55.358
I think if you're able to get here,

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.493
you should come to New York right now.

01:10:57.495 --> 01:11:00.262
Yes. As soon
as possible.

01:11:00.264 --> 01:11:02.530
Good-bye, Ms. Payne.

01:11:03.165 --> 01:11:06.866
What is it?
Tell me what's going on.

01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:55.914
I'm waiting.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:02.319
2 years ago when I got
that big IRS refund check.

01:12:04.289 --> 01:12:06.656
Now, that's entirely
too long for a girl to go

01:12:06.658 --> 01:12:09.458
without feeling the rush
of a little shopping spree.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.361
So... Bergdorf's it is.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:14.595
What's my limit?

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:17.598
Just keep in mind that I'm jobless.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.932
5,000.

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.633
You crazy.

01:12:20.635 --> 01:12:24.503
And you could use a pedicure.

01:12:24.505 --> 01:12:27.372
My balance at Bergdorf's is zero.

01:12:27.374 --> 01:12:30.541
Well, I'll work with that.

01:12:30.543 --> 01:12:31.375
OK.

01:12:31.377 --> 01:12:33.110
You know, your plants were petrified,

01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:35.245
and when was the last time you vacuumed?

01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:38.648
Girl, you know I had
to fire that housekeeper.

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:42.652
That bitch was eating me
out of house and home.

01:12:42.654 --> 01:12:44.587
I'd get up there to the refrigerator,

01:12:44.589 --> 01:12:47.089
there's be nothing left but a dollop.

01:12:47.091 --> 01:12:49.491
I had to suck her ass
outta there like a Hoover.

01:12:49.493 --> 01:12:51.226
That's what I called her.

01:12:51.228 --> 01:12:54.195
Miss Hoover, get the fuck out of my house.

01:12:55.264 --> 01:12:57.597
Hey.

01:12:57.599 --> 01:13:00.499
Turn that up, girl.

01:13:06.606 --> 01:13:09.073
Hey.

01:13:12.644 --> 01:13:17.113
What you trying to do, the skate?

01:13:18.349 --> 01:13:20.849
Whoop. Snuffy's
going away party.

01:13:20.851 --> 01:13:24.686
You and Cooper going down
the Soul Train line.

01:13:24.688 --> 01:13:28.222
Both of you,
10-inch afros,

01:13:28.224 --> 01:13:30.357
looking like you was having a seizure.

01:13:30.359 --> 01:13:32.392
And forgive me,

01:13:32.394 --> 01:13:35.027
but it was a hot pink
polyester jump-suit

01:13:35.029 --> 01:13:37.529
that you were wearing,
which I distinctly remember

01:13:37.531 --> 01:13:39.531
telling you was a bad fashion statement.

01:13:39.533 --> 01:13:43.668
I never wore a hot pink
jump-suit in my life, bitch.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:47.705
Right. Well, I was right behind
you in my sexy mini-skirt

01:13:47.707 --> 01:13:50.374
and silver lamé halter,

01:13:50.376 --> 01:13:52.676
but unfortunately, I was dancing with

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.711
no-deodorant-wearing
Johnny.

01:13:54.713 --> 01:13:57.480
Funky Johnny...

01:13:57.482 --> 01:13:58.380
to his friends.

01:13:58.382 --> 01:14:01.316
That was the same night
that Cooper's ex-girlfriend

01:14:01.318 --> 01:14:02.984
snatched off Melanie's afro wig,

01:14:02.986 --> 01:14:05.686
and everybody started
tossing it back and forth.

01:14:05.688 --> 01:14:07.220
What was her name?

01:14:07.222 --> 01:14:10.056
Cassandra, girl.

01:14:11.492 --> 01:14:13.525
Cassandra the ho.

01:14:13.527 --> 01:14:17.362
Cassandra
the 360-degree ho.

01:14:18.031 --> 01:14:21.032
Child, you step on her foot, her legs open.

01:14:21.034 --> 01:14:22.299
Motherfuckers come tumbling out,

01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:24.601
people you ain't seen for years.

01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:27.637
Talking about,
"Hey! Hey!

01:14:27.639 --> 01:14:30.473
I've been up here
with Cassandra."

01:14:30.475 --> 01:14:33.642
I seen a Volkswagen come out of there.

01:14:33.644 --> 01:14:36.177
That's why Cooper left her for you,

01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:38.412
the Kama Sutra herself.

01:14:38.414 --> 01:14:40.647
The boy didn't leave her for me.

01:14:40.649 --> 01:14:44.150
Cooper left for
cock-eyed Charly.

01:14:44.152 --> 01:14:44.750
Who?

01:14:44.752 --> 01:14:47.185
You remember...
You remember him?

01:14:47.187 --> 01:14:50.588
Talk about, "Charly,
put your glasses on."

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:52.556
Child, he'd look you dead in the face

01:14:52.558 --> 01:14:56.459
and you know he was seeing
8 of you like The Fly.

01:14:56.461 --> 01:15:00.596
He was talking,
"I don't need no glasses."

01:15:00.598 --> 01:15:02.230
I liked Charly.

01:15:02.232 --> 01:15:04.732
If he'd just keep his eyes shut.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:10.136
What? What?

01:15:11.038 --> 01:15:12.971
Give me a hit.

01:15:22.515 --> 01:15:24.147
Should I call the doctor?

01:15:38.128 --> 01:15:40.328
What's wrong?

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.063
Why you shaking?

01:15:42.065 --> 01:15:46.233
I'm not.
It's just cold in here.

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.802
It's my breath, ain't it?

01:15:51.138 --> 01:15:53.505
I smell bad, child.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.506
No, you don't.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:57.675
I smell like Funky Johnny.

01:15:59.745 --> 01:16:02.112
Nobody would tell him.

01:16:02.114 --> 01:16:03.246
I told him.

01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:04.347
What? You did?

01:16:04.349 --> 01:16:06.215
What did you tell him?

01:16:06.217 --> 01:16:09.017
"You stink,
motherfucker."

01:16:11.488 --> 01:16:12.854
Did it hurt his feelings?

01:16:12.856 --> 01:16:15.056
He was mad.

01:16:15.058 --> 01:16:16.424
He was mad.

01:16:16.426 --> 01:16:19.093
I love you, girl.

01:16:19.095 --> 01:16:20.627
I love you, too.

01:16:23.365 --> 01:16:25.298
I'm scared.

01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:28.634
Yeah. Me, too.

01:16:29.637 --> 01:16:32.304
Want to do me a favor?

01:16:32.306 --> 01:16:35.073
Anything. You name it.

01:16:35.075 --> 01:16:38.309
Sing to me.

01:16:38.311 --> 01:16:40.744
Sing what?

01:16:40.746 --> 01:16:43.146
I don't know.

01:16:43.148 --> 01:16:44.780
Don't matter.

01:16:46.918 --> 01:16:48.384
Come on.

01:17:22.882 --> 01:17:24.681
Gimme your hand.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.449
I'll hold your hand.

01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:28.284
Just gonna sleep.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:41.029
And now, we'll have a few closing remarks

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:45.700
from Delilah's dear friend
Ms. Stella Payne.

01:18:22.805 --> 01:18:25.906
D would tell me to make it quick,

01:18:25.908 --> 01:18:29.476
don't get all mushy on her,

01:18:29.478 --> 01:18:31.778
so I'll try.

01:18:33.348 --> 01:18:34.880
I guess it really shouldn't matter

01:18:34.882 --> 01:18:39.351
that she didn't tell me
right off that she was sick.

01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:44.456
That I'm mad at you, D, for finally doing

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:48.560
what you've never been able to do...

01:18:48.562 --> 01:18:49.961
keep a secret.

01:18:54.967 --> 01:18:58.568
Who's gonna be my best friend now

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.903
is what I want to know.

01:19:00.905 --> 01:19:03.372
We had 20 whole years behind us.

01:19:03.374 --> 01:19:06.875
That's a long time to love somebody.

01:19:07.978 --> 01:19:11.012
I hope you like it up there, D.

01:19:11.014 --> 01:19:12.847
Look for my mama.

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:15.416
She'll be near a bid whist game

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:18.752
or cooking greens and ham hocks.

01:19:21.956 --> 01:19:25.524
I hope you guys are half as blessed as I was

01:19:25.526 --> 01:19:28.527
to have a friend as...

01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:30.595
cool...

01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:32.697
as funny...

01:19:32.699 --> 01:19:35.700
as smart...

01:19:35.702 --> 01:19:38.669
and as crazy as she.

01:19:44.076 --> 01:19:47.677
Life is but a dream.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.985
Look!

01:20:08.597 --> 01:20:10.129
What are you doing here?

01:20:10.131 --> 01:20:12.397
I came to check up on your mum.

01:20:12.399 --> 01:20:14.899
She's kind of sad right now.

01:20:19.005 --> 01:20:21.472
I'm surprised you came.

01:20:39.957 --> 01:20:43.892
Thank you for coming.

01:21:13.518 --> 01:21:17.887
So...
I hate packing,

01:21:17.889 --> 01:21:19.955
but I guess I should get upstairs.

01:21:19.957 --> 01:21:21.990
The kids have to get back.

01:21:21.992 --> 01:21:26.160
I have to get on with my life,
whatever that is.

01:21:26.162 --> 01:21:27.161
I love you.

01:21:27.163 --> 01:21:29.897
Dealing with this buyout,
looking for a new job.

01:21:29.899 --> 01:21:32.499
I love you, Stella.

01:21:32.501 --> 01:21:36.002
No, you don't.

01:21:36.004 --> 01:21:37.636
You couldn't.

01:21:37.638 --> 01:21:43.608
Yes, I do. Very much.

01:21:45.244 --> 01:21:49.646
Winston, we haven't talked about your plans.

01:21:49.648 --> 01:21:50.947
What are you going...

01:21:50.949 --> 01:21:54.483
What time does our plane leave?

01:21:56.653 --> 01:21:58.853
10:15.

01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:02.956
OK.

01:22:21.075 --> 01:22:24.609
Tell your mama we're tired.
I'll call her tomorrow.

01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:26.711
Quincy, please hurry up.

01:22:26.713 --> 01:22:28.713
OK, mama.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:31.715
Here you go.

01:22:37.055 --> 01:22:39.155
Is that smoke?

01:22:39.157 --> 01:22:40.856
Where?

01:22:40.858 --> 01:22:42.457
No.

01:22:43.226 --> 01:22:45.926
No, please...

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:47.627
What?

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.561
Nothing.

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:49.695
Auntie Stell?

01:22:49.697 --> 01:22:51.096
Mum's having everyone over for a barbecue,

01:22:51.098 --> 01:22:53.264
and she doesn't care how tired you are.

01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:54.531
Get your butt in here.

01:22:54.533 --> 01:22:57.233
A barbecue? I'd like
to meet your family.

01:22:57.235 --> 01:23:01.604
I thought we'd wait
a couple months before that.

01:23:01.606 --> 01:23:03.038
But I'm hungry.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.974
I have food at home.

01:23:08.645 --> 01:23:10.011
Where is he?

01:23:11.114 --> 01:23:13.581
We want to meet him.

01:23:16.118 --> 01:23:19.652
Winston?
You in there, baby?

01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:23.887
Hey.

01:23:23.889 --> 01:23:25.655
Stella.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.594
Well, well, hi there, Winston.

01:23:32.596 --> 01:23:33.595
How do you do?

01:23:33.597 --> 01:23:35.997
As you can see, I'm even more
beautiful and brilliant

01:23:35.999 --> 01:23:38.165
than whatever-her-name-is.

01:23:38.167 --> 01:23:40.634
Get your butt out of that car!

01:23:40.636 --> 01:23:41.968
OK.

01:23:44.238 --> 01:23:45.971
That's Vanessa.
Right.

01:23:45.973 --> 01:23:49.607
A little outspoken.
Can be downright tacky.

01:23:49.609 --> 01:23:51.575
I like her already.

01:23:51.577 --> 01:23:53.643
I know she in there talking about me.

01:23:54.646 --> 01:23:55.878
Nobody's talking about you.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.146
Let me see!
Let me see!

01:23:58.148 --> 01:23:59.580
Hey, here they come!

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:01.715
Can't wait to see them.

01:24:01.717 --> 01:24:04.651
Hey, y'all get out of the car!

01:24:04.653 --> 01:24:06.152
Welcome home.

01:24:06.154 --> 01:24:07.853
Yeah, he's up in there.

01:24:07.855 --> 01:24:10.789
Stella's got herself a man!

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:12.257
Come on.

01:24:12.259 --> 01:24:14.859
We all waiting for you.

01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:18.128
Y'all in that car,
get out now! Come on!

01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:19.762
Bring him out now!

01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:20.596
Stella!

01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:22.030
Ashamed or something?

01:24:22.032 --> 01:24:23.898
Open the door, Stella.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.634
Mom!
Guess what.

01:24:26.636 --> 01:24:27.935
Dad's here!

01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:29.803
What?!

01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:40.778
Lord have mercy.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.346
Hey, Walter.

01:24:42.348 --> 01:24:46.083
Good to see you.
What you doing here, spying?

01:24:46.085 --> 01:24:48.718
In town on business.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.020
Excuse me.

01:24:51.022 --> 01:24:52.621
I ran here as fast as I could

01:24:52.623 --> 01:24:55.890
just to see how miserable you are.

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:10.235
So, Stella says you got 2 growing in here.

01:25:10.237 --> 01:25:12.971
Yep. Both boys,
due in December.

01:25:12.973 --> 01:25:14.772
Well, I cannot wait to meet them.

01:25:14.774 --> 01:25:18.108
Are you coming back at
Christmas or not leaving?

01:25:22.347 --> 01:25:24.280
Bid it if you dare.

01:25:24.282 --> 01:25:25.814
What?

01:25:28.251 --> 01:25:32.820
Hey, they got to know who's boss!

01:25:41.896 --> 01:25:43.362
Dad! Go, Dad!

01:25:43.364 --> 01:25:45.997
Stella, I'm not saying he's not nice.

01:25:45.999 --> 01:25:48.232
I'm not saying he's not educated.

01:25:48.234 --> 01:25:51.969
You can't possibly think
this is going anywhere.

01:25:51.971 --> 01:25:53.904
Let's be serious for a minute here.

01:25:53.906 --> 01:25:57.240
Why don't you just shut the fuck up, Angela?

01:25:57.242 --> 01:25:58.407
Amen.

01:25:58.409 --> 01:26:00.709
Show my...

01:26:01.344 --> 01:26:03.744
Winston, I'm Walter.

01:26:03.746 --> 01:26:06.113
Nice to meet you, Walter.

01:26:06.115 --> 01:26:07.614
Hey!

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.053
Well, thank God she don't need a man

01:26:14.055 --> 01:26:15.988
to pay her bills like some of us do.

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:18.256
Let me just put the shit on out there, OK?

01:26:18.258 --> 01:26:20.758
And I don't care how old he is,

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.694
if he got you glowing like
a night light and shit,

01:26:23.696 --> 01:26:25.128
I say keep his ass.

01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:27.964
Thank you, Vanessa.

01:26:33.371 --> 01:26:35.704
I love you, Winston.

01:26:51.254 --> 01:26:54.989
She can be stubborn as all hell.

01:26:54.991 --> 01:26:57.291
But you know that by now.

01:26:57.293 --> 01:26:58.292
Don't you?

01:26:58.294 --> 01:27:00.494
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I do.

01:27:00.496 --> 01:27:04.464
Thinks she knows everything.
She's always right.

01:27:04.466 --> 01:27:07.400
I hate to admit it, but she usually is.

01:27:07.402 --> 01:27:09.602
Just don't bow down to her.

01:27:09.604 --> 01:27:11.503
Otherwise, she'll treat you like a chump

01:27:11.505 --> 01:27:13.404
and trade your ass in for a new model.

01:27:13.406 --> 01:27:14.838
Then I promise you, I won't.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:19.943
Good, 'cause she needs a man
to stand up for himself.

01:27:22.113 --> 01:27:24.847
Did that work for you?

01:27:24.849 --> 01:27:26.215
Hell no.

01:27:28.586 --> 01:27:32.020
Hey!
Break that mess up.

01:27:43.432 --> 01:27:45.832
Drop the bags.

01:27:45.834 --> 01:27:48.067
OK.

01:27:52.305 --> 01:27:54.605
So this is where you live.

01:27:54.607 --> 01:27:55.839
Yep.

01:27:55.841 --> 01:27:58.474
This is home.

01:27:58.476 --> 01:28:01.977
Come on, drop your bags.
I'll give you a tour.

01:28:01.979 --> 01:28:02.610
OK?

01:28:02.612 --> 01:28:05.012
Yeah, it's OK, but
your room is off-limits

01:28:05.014 --> 01:28:06.947
until it's disinfected.

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.214
Come on!

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:13.886
My mum's office.
She made that desk.

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:24.162
OK... last but not least,

01:28:24.164 --> 01:28:26.197
this is where my mum
used to make all her stuff.

01:28:26.199 --> 01:28:29.967
She's thinking about turning it
back into the guest room.

01:28:29.969 --> 01:28:33.503
So, I'm thinking about moving in here

01:28:33.505 --> 01:28:35.505
when I'm 15.

01:28:35.507 --> 01:28:37.573
More privacy.

01:28:37.575 --> 01:28:40.342
How long has it been
since she's been out here?

01:28:40.344 --> 01:28:42.944
I don't know.

01:28:42.946 --> 01:28:44.412
Years.

01:28:44.414 --> 01:28:47.348
Before I started driving...

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:49.016
my go-kart.

01:28:57.559 --> 01:29:00.893
Well, tour's over.

01:29:00.895 --> 01:29:03.996
Yeah, man.

01:29:03.998 --> 01:29:06.198
Thank you for showing me around.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.035
Can I talk to you?

01:29:12.238 --> 01:29:13.570
Man-to-man?

01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:21.310
Well, I don't see any kids around.

01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:28.049
Well, you know my mum likes you.

01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:29.116
Well, I hope so.

01:29:29.118 --> 01:29:32.652
I mean, I've seen her
with other guys before,

01:29:32.654 --> 01:29:36.522
but she really likes you.

01:29:36.524 --> 01:29:37.589
How can you tell?

01:29:37.591 --> 01:29:41.426
You're the only one she's
brought over here overnight.

01:29:41.428 --> 01:29:44.629
You're, like, staying.

01:29:48.201 --> 01:29:49.233
You wouldn't ever

01:29:49.235 --> 01:29:52.536
try to break her heart,
or anything, would you?

01:29:52.538 --> 01:29:54.571
Because if you did,

01:29:54.573 --> 01:29:57.340
you'd have to deal with me.

01:29:59.277 --> 01:30:02.678
Let me tell you something, Quincy.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:07.516
As long as your mum
has you watching her back,

01:30:07.518 --> 01:30:11.019
she got no worries, man.

01:30:11.021 --> 01:30:13.454
Of any kind.

01:30:30.137 --> 01:30:33.404
Thanks for letting me drive today, Winston.

01:30:33.406 --> 01:30:34.338
What? No!

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.406
It was just out of the driveway

01:30:36.408 --> 01:30:38.441
and in an empty parking lot.

01:30:39.444 --> 01:30:40.709
There were no cars...

01:30:40.711 --> 01:30:41.609
No driving!

01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:44.478
He's old enough to drive!

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.579
I'm a good driver!

01:30:45.581 --> 01:30:47.581
I learned when I was 9.
He told me he wanted

01:30:47.583 --> 01:30:50.383
to celebrate his 16th birthday at the DMV.

01:30:50.385 --> 01:30:53.419
I know. The invitations
go out on Monday.

01:30:53.421 --> 01:30:54.620
Really?

01:30:59.159 --> 01:31:02.026
Do they really do parties at the DMV?

01:31:02.028 --> 01:31:03.494
Aww...

01:31:50.108 --> 01:31:53.109
Is there anything I can do?

01:31:55.246 --> 01:32:00.182
I just wish I could call her.

01:32:02.219 --> 01:32:06.187
She was my best friend since forever.

01:32:06.789 --> 01:32:10.490
That's a long time to forget.

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:30.042
You don't have to forget.

01:32:58.638 --> 01:33:00.704
That was wicked!

01:33:05.443 --> 01:33:06.775
Hey.

01:33:08.712 --> 01:33:10.712
Press it!
Press the button!

01:33:10.714 --> 01:33:12.547
I'm pressing the button!

01:33:12.549 --> 01:33:15.650
And when are we gonna see you guys again?

01:33:15.652 --> 01:33:18.219
Y'all been holed up in that love den,

01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:19.887
and I want to know what y'all doing.

01:33:19.889 --> 01:33:22.489
When can we come over
and get something to eat?

01:33:22.491 --> 01:33:24.624
You said he could cook,
and until we get a sample

01:33:24.626 --> 01:33:26.392
you know I'm gonna think you're lying.

01:33:26.394 --> 01:33:28.894
Vanessa, I'm waiting for
my future clients to call.

01:33:28.896 --> 01:33:31.796
I don't have time to
check my dinner schedule,

01:33:31.798 --> 01:33:34.431
but Thanksgiving sounds good.

01:33:34.433 --> 01:33:35.665
Listen, I'll talk to you later.

01:33:35.667 --> 01:33:38.801
Wait a minute. How does
Quincy like him?

01:33:38.803 --> 01:33:39.735
Bye, Vanessa.

01:33:39.737 --> 01:33:41.203
Well, what about the dog?

01:33:41.205 --> 01:33:43.305
He proposed to him last night.
He's thinking it over.

01:33:43.307 --> 01:33:45.307
I'll talk to you later.

01:33:45.309 --> 01:33:49.244
Stella, wait...
She hung up on me.

01:33:49.246 --> 01:33:50.478
I'm gonna have to call her again.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.480
Hey, come on!

01:33:52.482 --> 01:33:55.516
I'm coming!
Goddamn!

01:33:55.518 --> 01:33:57.217
Be patient.

01:33:57.219 --> 01:33:58.451
There you go.

01:33:58.453 --> 01:33:59.552
Thank you, sweetie.

01:33:59.554 --> 01:34:02.321
Thank you for taking Quincy
to Little League practice.

01:34:02.323 --> 01:34:06.725
No problem.
I don't mind at all.

01:34:24.477 --> 01:34:26.577
Hello.
My.

01:34:51.336 --> 01:34:53.269
I told you you was gonna like it.

01:34:53.271 --> 01:34:56.305
I saw you laughing, Stella.
I saw you.

01:34:56.307 --> 01:34:59.641
Don't stand there and lie to me.

01:34:59.643 --> 01:35:00.742
Stella!

01:35:00.744 --> 01:35:01.642
Angela.

01:35:01.644 --> 01:35:04.544
We didn't see you guys in line.

01:35:04.546 --> 01:35:06.512
We were in the back.

01:35:06.514 --> 01:35:07.412
Forgive me.

01:35:07.414 --> 01:35:08.746
Judge Spencer Boyle, Leslie James,

01:35:08.748 --> 01:35:10.280
this is my sister Stella.

01:35:10.282 --> 01:35:12.515
So nice to finally meet you, Stella.

01:35:12.517 --> 01:35:14.450
You, too, Judge.

01:35:14.452 --> 01:35:15.651
How do you do?

01:35:15.653 --> 01:35:16.585
Fine, thank you.

01:35:16.587 --> 01:35:18.887
And Winston.
Anybody hungry?

01:35:18.889 --> 01:35:21.289
Kennedy, how you feeling, man?

01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:23.024
Fine. Just grateful
for an aisle seat.

01:35:23.026 --> 01:35:25.459
You know how those trips
to the ladies' room get.

01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:29.329
Did you cry at the end or what?

01:35:29.331 --> 01:35:30.029
Well...

01:35:30.031 --> 01:35:31.897
Actually, we saw that one.

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:37.835
You're kidding.

01:35:37.837 --> 01:35:40.871
No. It was...
hilarious.

01:35:42.374 --> 01:35:44.407
Well, we're heading home.

01:35:44.409 --> 01:35:46.842
It was nice meeting you both.

01:35:46.844 --> 01:35:49.578
The offer still stands, Stella.

01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.913
If you change your mind about running,

01:35:51.915 --> 01:35:53.247
give me a call.

01:35:53.249 --> 01:35:57.584
Running? Well,
we'd like that.

01:36:00.589 --> 01:36:02.021
All right.

01:36:02.023 --> 01:36:03.288
OK, man.

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:04.422
Ta.

01:36:04.424 --> 01:36:05.623
Get home safe.

01:36:05.625 --> 01:36:07.958
Good night.

01:36:12.998 --> 01:36:14.330
Surprise.

01:36:14.332 --> 01:36:16.332
I'll say. What brings
you all the way here

01:36:16.334 --> 01:36:18.901
and without calling?
Were you at the mall?

01:36:18.903 --> 01:36:20.335
No. I wasn't
at the mall.

01:36:20.337 --> 01:36:22.970
I want you to know that
I didn't appreciate the way

01:36:22.972 --> 01:36:25.672
you totally disrespected Winston yesterday.

01:36:25.674 --> 01:36:26.973
What are you talking about?

01:36:26.975 --> 01:36:28.507
"That's Winston."

01:36:28.509 --> 01:36:31.476
Like he's some nonentity or some child.

01:36:31.478 --> 01:36:33.311
Well, he is.

01:36:33.313 --> 01:36:34.879
He's my boyfriend, Angela, all right?

01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:37.615
What did you want me to do,
get out the trumpets?

01:36:37.617 --> 01:36:39.617
Let me say this once.
I like him.

01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:42.553
You don't have to,
but he's here till whenever,

01:36:42.555 --> 01:36:44.621
so you might as well get used to it.

01:36:44.623 --> 01:36:49.292
I'm... I'm sorry
if I was rude.

01:36:49.294 --> 01:36:51.794
I didn't mean to be.

01:36:51.796 --> 01:36:56.365
But, Stella, aren't you
the least bit nervous

01:36:56.367 --> 01:36:58.333
about this whole thing?

01:36:58.335 --> 01:37:01.436
Of course I am, Angela.

01:37:23.092 --> 01:37:26.827
Whatever you're cooking, can I taste it?

01:37:28.564 --> 01:37:29.930
Sure.

01:37:40.108 --> 01:37:41.640
Your check, sir.

01:37:41.642 --> 01:37:43.408
Thank you.

01:37:49.649 --> 01:37:51.515
OK. Hey.

01:37:54.753 --> 01:37:56.119
How are you doing?

01:37:56.121 --> 01:37:59.455
It's OK.
I'll get it tonight.

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:00.756
I don't mind.

01:38:00.758 --> 01:38:01.823
But I can manage.

01:38:01.825 --> 01:38:04.793
Why should you always pay for everything?

01:38:04.795 --> 01:38:06.594
Because you can't afford it.

01:38:06.596 --> 01:38:08.562
If you want me to be a man,

01:38:08.564 --> 01:38:10.764
let me act like it once in a while.

01:38:10.766 --> 01:38:13.133
Please put it away.

01:38:13.969 --> 01:38:15.935
Fine.

01:38:15.937 --> 01:38:20.105
Pay the mortgage next month
while you're at it.

01:38:20.107 --> 01:38:21.773
Why'd you have to start this?

01:38:21.775 --> 01:38:24.675
Wait, wait, wait. I think
you've got it backwards.

01:38:24.677 --> 01:38:26.743
Look at you.

01:38:26.745 --> 01:38:29.078
You're the one who has to have everything

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.712
your way or no way.

01:38:30.714 --> 01:38:32.513
You're the one who always
has to be in control,

01:38:32.515 --> 01:38:35.182
or you don't know what to do with yourself.

01:38:35.184 --> 01:38:37.083
You're turning it around

01:38:37.085 --> 01:38:38.951
because I'm picking up the stupid check?

01:38:38.953 --> 01:38:40.552
No. You can't decide

01:38:40.554 --> 01:38:44.722
whether you want me to be
a boy or a man. Admit it.

01:38:44.724 --> 01:38:45.789
Admit it.
Please.

01:38:45.791 --> 01:38:48.091
From the guy who made a
midnight run to the video store

01:38:48.093 --> 01:38:52.995
and came back with
Booty Call and L <i> ion King?</i>

01:38:53.864 --> 01:38:57.999
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:39:02.905 --> 01:39:06.840
I feel as though I'm moving
back instead of forward.

01:39:06.842 --> 01:39:09.209
Here I am in the prime of my life,

01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:12.145
and my boyfriend's idea
of a romantic evening

01:39:12.147 --> 01:39:14.914
is watching the Disney Channel
while you eat dry cereal.

01:39:14.916 --> 01:39:18.117
That's if you're not busy
playing video games with Quincy.

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:21.954
And how many times do I tell
you to take out the trash?

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:25.057
Or if the car's on "E,"
put a little gas in it.

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:28.627
Cook something that doesn't
give us all heartburn.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:31.529
That is my point.

01:39:31.531 --> 01:39:33.964
You know what, Stella?

01:39:33.966 --> 01:39:35.565
I'm tired, too, OK?

01:39:35.567 --> 01:39:38.000
I'm tired of being scolded
every time I do or don't do

01:39:38.002 --> 01:39:41.136
something that's not on
your long list of rules.

01:39:41.138 --> 01:39:43.271
I don't make the rules.

01:39:43.273 --> 01:39:44.171
Yes, you do.

01:39:44.173 --> 01:39:46.139
We don't go anywhere unless you suggest it.

01:39:46.141 --> 01:39:49.675
And then when I do, what happens?

01:39:49.677 --> 01:39:51.877
You might as well laugh in my face.

01:39:51.879 --> 01:39:55.547
Why don't we visit your friends?

01:39:55.549 --> 01:39:57.048
Are you ashamed of me?

01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:58.716
Am I a little
well-kept secret?

01:39:58.718 --> 01:40:02.586
That is not true, and you know it.

01:40:02.588 --> 01:40:05.655
Stella, I can't change being 20.

01:40:05.657 --> 01:40:07.256
I can't change that,

01:40:07.258 --> 01:40:09.358
and you can't change your age, either.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.061
But you knew what we were
dealing with before I came.

01:40:15.365 --> 01:40:18.632
So if you can't handle it

01:40:18.634 --> 01:40:21.935
or it's too much for you to
deal with all of a sudden,

01:40:21.937 --> 01:40:26.973
then maybe we should just
forget this whole thing. OK?

01:40:29.777 --> 01:40:33.178
If it'll make you feel any better,

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.713
you leave the tip.

01:41:13.085 --> 01:41:15.652
I'm sorry.

01:41:15.654 --> 01:41:16.285
Come.

01:41:16.287 --> 01:41:19.121
I want to show you something.

01:41:55.959 --> 01:41:58.359
What have you done, Winston?

01:41:58.361 --> 01:42:00.227
I can't believe this.

01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:02.162
How did you...
When did you?

01:42:02.164 --> 01:42:06.099
While you were snoring, running, shopping...

01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:08.835
I don't snore.

01:42:09.838 --> 01:42:13.806
My god.

01:42:15.776 --> 01:42:18.977
What's that?

01:42:21.414 --> 01:42:23.180
I don't believe it.

01:42:23.182 --> 01:42:26.383
So now you can make your
own cracked glass table

01:42:26.385 --> 01:42:30.019
or zebra-skin sofa
or anything you want

01:42:30.021 --> 01:42:31.720
whenever you want,

01:42:31.722 --> 01:42:35.890
and no one's ever going to bother you.

01:42:35.892 --> 01:42:38.092
Thank you.

01:42:39.762 --> 01:42:42.195
You are quite welcome.

01:42:49.938 --> 01:42:54.307
What we're trying
to say is that in your absence

01:42:54.309 --> 01:42:56.208
it's become quite clear to us

01:42:56.210 --> 01:42:58.310
how important you are to the company.

01:42:58.312 --> 01:43:00.745
Merger or no merger,

01:43:00.747 --> 01:43:03.314
we're creating a spot for you, Stella.

01:43:03.316 --> 01:43:05.416
We want you to come back.

01:43:05.418 --> 01:43:10.187
Executive V.P.
275,000 to start

01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:12.222
plus incentives.

01:43:23.168 --> 01:43:24.333
Hey.

01:43:24.335 --> 01:43:26.201
Hey.

01:43:29.806 --> 01:43:31.505
You're back so soon.

01:43:31.507 --> 01:43:33.440
So, how'd it go?

01:43:33.442 --> 01:43:36.943
I cannot believe what I just did.

01:43:36.945 --> 01:43:38.444
What?

01:43:38.446 --> 01:43:41.213
I don't want to talk about it.

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:44.049
They offered you your job back and...

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:47.185
and you turned them down, didn't you?

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.988
Yeah.

01:43:51.523 --> 01:43:53.990
You should have heard me going on and on

01:43:53.992 --> 01:43:56.359
about how I can do this on my own.

01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:59.495
But how am I actually supposed to do it?

01:43:59.497 --> 01:44:02.264
Am I supposed to sit
at home with my computers,

01:44:02.266 --> 01:44:06.034
4 little clients, and no
support system whatsoever

01:44:06.036 --> 01:44:09.037
and wind up back in
the job market in 6 months?

01:44:09.039 --> 01:44:11.339
I have too many responsibilities.

01:44:11.341 --> 01:44:12.506
This is crazy.

01:44:12.508 --> 01:44:15.408
No.
No, it's not crazy.

01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:18.077
The business is going to be fine.

01:44:18.079 --> 01:44:21.313
Maybe now you'll have
some time for yourself.

01:44:21.315 --> 01:44:24.282
You can come back in here and make things

01:44:24.284 --> 01:44:26.050
and start having fun again.

01:44:26.052 --> 01:44:29.119
Sweetie, listen, I cannot sit in here

01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:31.020
and be Demi Moore in dappled light.

01:44:31.022 --> 01:44:32.888
That is not the real world.

01:44:32.890 --> 01:44:35.323
You're just a little bit panicked now,

01:44:35.325 --> 01:44:38.459
but everything's going to be OK.

01:44:38.461 --> 01:44:39.493
You never know.

01:44:39.495 --> 01:44:42.529
Maybe once you start making
your furniture again,

01:44:42.531 --> 01:44:45.832
people will buy it.

01:44:46.434 --> 01:44:50.402
Who said anything about selling it?

01:44:51.371 --> 01:44:54.438
Hey, I'm just dreaming out loud for you.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.441
While you're dreaming,
I got a million calls to make.

01:44:57.443 --> 01:45:02.345
I got to get a web site,
a company name, letterhead...

01:45:02.347 --> 01:45:05.881
But not today.

01:45:09.219 --> 01:45:10.351
I bought you something.

01:45:10.353 --> 01:45:14.054
Winston, you did not have
to buy me a present.

01:45:14.056 --> 01:45:16.990
It's not exactly a present.

01:45:48.356 --> 01:45:53.058
You know, Winston, people...

01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:55.994
can be together a long time
and love each other

01:45:55.996 --> 01:46:01.466
before they even think about
doing something like this.

01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:06.336
It's just a simple question.

01:46:08.106 --> 01:46:11.073
All it takes is a yes or a no.

01:46:11.075 --> 01:46:13.341
My heart says yes,

01:46:13.343 --> 01:46:18.479
but just let me give it
a little more thought, OK?

01:46:21.617 --> 01:46:23.850
OK.

01:47:06.491 --> 01:47:07.423
OK, son,

01:47:07.425 --> 01:47:11.093
show me the projects that you've worked on.

01:47:14.465 --> 01:47:16.031
I think we need to put the money

01:47:16.033 --> 01:47:17.032
into the computers,

01:47:17.034 --> 01:47:18.266
into the books, into the children.

01:47:18.268 --> 01:47:21.102
Well, I think you're wrong.

01:47:21.104 --> 01:47:23.003
He's my mum's new boyfriend.

01:47:23.005 --> 01:47:24.504
His name is Winston.

01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.405
He's from Jamaica.

01:47:26.407 --> 01:47:28.306
You know, when I went
to Jamaica, we met him.

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:30.074
When I went there...

01:47:38.717 --> 01:47:41.350
I'll be right there.

01:47:51.495 --> 01:47:53.161
What's wrong, Winston?

01:47:53.163 --> 01:47:55.496
What do you mean, what's wrong?

01:47:55.498 --> 01:47:57.464
You've been sulking since we got here.

01:47:57.466 --> 01:47:59.199
You've been sulking all day.

01:47:59.201 --> 01:48:02.168
I can't believe you're saying this to me.

01:48:02.170 --> 01:48:04.403
What, did I miss something?

01:48:06.106 --> 01:48:08.172
Last week, I asked you to marry me.

01:48:08.174 --> 01:48:11.708
To spend your life with me,
and I don't have an answer.

01:48:11.710 --> 01:48:13.342
Do we have to talk about it now?

01:48:13.344 --> 01:48:14.409
How long do I have to wait?

01:48:14.411 --> 01:48:18.079
Or should I pretend that I didn't even ask?

01:48:18.081 --> 01:48:19.513
So you can be so selfish?

01:48:19.515 --> 01:48:22.616
Look, don't talk to my mama like that.

01:48:22.618 --> 01:48:23.750
Look, I'm talking to you!

01:48:23.752 --> 01:48:25.218
You need to jump back, boy!

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.485
You don't speak to my son

01:48:26.487 --> 01:48:27.519
in that tone of voice.

01:48:27.521 --> 01:48:29.354
Yeah, because I don't appreciate it.

01:48:29.356 --> 01:48:31.155
Shut up, Quincy!

01:48:38.130 --> 01:48:40.029
Quincy, I'm sorry, man.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.566
For real.

01:48:45.402 --> 01:48:47.735
Come on, you guys.

01:48:47.737 --> 01:48:48.837
It's cool.

01:48:48.839 --> 01:48:51.506
Let's just go home, OK?

01:52:03.977 --> 01:52:07.044
Winston, we need to talk.

01:52:07.046 --> 01:52:08.979
I know. Climb in.

01:52:08.981 --> 01:52:12.315
Come on, I won't let you fall.

01:52:15.053 --> 01:52:18.687
All right, put your head back.

01:52:18.689 --> 01:52:20.422
All right.

01:52:20.424 --> 01:52:21.456
OK?

01:52:21.458 --> 01:52:23.524
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:26.595 --> 01:52:28.795
You know, I need to talk to you, too.

01:52:28.797 --> 01:52:30.496
Yeah? About what?

01:52:30.498 --> 01:52:32.331
No. Please,
you can go first.

01:52:32.333 --> 01:52:33.765
No.

01:52:33.767 --> 01:52:35.333
You go.

01:52:35.868 --> 01:52:37.100
I've been thinking a lot

01:52:37.102 --> 01:52:40.369
about some of the things
that you've been saying.

01:52:40.371 --> 01:52:42.471
Really? What things?

01:52:43.006 --> 01:52:45.106
You have a lot of worries
in your life right now

01:52:45.108 --> 01:52:48.676
without figuring me into the picture,

01:52:48.678 --> 01:52:51.478
and a real man...

01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.846
The kind you deserve,

01:52:53.848 --> 01:52:55.848
would be making things a bit easier for you.

01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:58.617
Winston, you're not adding to my troubles,

01:52:58.619 --> 01:53:00.452
if that's what you're thinking.

01:53:00.454 --> 01:53:02.554
Besides...

01:53:03.056 --> 01:53:07.525
Money's a sad reason
for folk to be together...

01:53:07.527 --> 01:53:08.792
or apart.

01:53:08.794 --> 01:53:12.495
Yes, but without it, life can be hard.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.866
Then there is the age difference.

01:53:17.868 --> 01:53:19.834
Well, that's never going to change.

01:53:19.836 --> 01:53:21.836
It doesn't bother me at all,

01:53:21.838 --> 01:53:24.905
you know, but I can see it bothers you.

01:53:24.907 --> 01:53:27.540
And I can't imagine what I'd have to do

01:53:27.542 --> 01:53:29.575
or tell you

01:53:29.577 --> 01:53:30.609
to convince you

01:53:30.611 --> 01:53:35.313
that no matter how many
young girls I may notice...

01:53:36.416 --> 01:53:39.950
You are the woman that I want.

01:53:43.555 --> 01:53:47.089
I was hoping to one day be your husband,

01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:49.157
have some children,

01:53:49.159 --> 01:53:53.394
but I can see now that
that could never happen.

01:53:53.396 --> 01:53:54.862
Probably not.

01:53:55.731 --> 01:53:57.664
You have a child

01:53:57.666 --> 01:53:59.899
and a mortgage and a career,

01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:01.567
and I have nothing.

01:54:01.569 --> 01:54:05.003
And I'm not satisfied with that.

01:54:05.005 --> 01:54:06.738
Not satisfied.

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.839
Winston,

01:54:07.841 --> 01:54:09.540
don't worry.

01:54:09.975 --> 01:54:13.042
It's coming.
You'll find your way.

01:54:15.079 --> 01:54:17.746
Well, I realize that I'm ready

01:54:17.748 --> 01:54:19.881
to go to medical school...

01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:22.015
So...

01:54:22.017 --> 01:54:25.952
I'm heading home
on a 10:00 flight.

01:54:27.488 --> 01:54:28.854
Home?

01:54:30.757 --> 01:54:32.523
Why so soon?

01:54:32.525 --> 01:54:36.527
Because I think it's easier this way.

01:54:47.738 --> 01:54:48.870
Hey, now!

01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:57.076
So, should I call you
Dr. Shakespeare?

01:54:57.078 --> 01:54:59.111
Yeah, not unless you want to die.

01:55:01.447 --> 01:55:03.547
All right, come here.

01:55:06.485 --> 01:55:10.153
I want you to take
good care of your mum, now.

01:55:10.155 --> 01:55:11.220
Hear?

01:55:11.222 --> 01:55:13.388
No worries, man.

01:55:16.593 --> 01:55:19.460
I hope I can see you again, Winston.

01:55:19.462 --> 01:55:21.662
You're a great man.

01:55:22.598 --> 01:55:24.864
You're a great man, too.

01:55:27.134 --> 01:55:30.835
Maybe your mum will let you
visit me one day?

01:55:30.837 --> 01:55:32.169
I hope so.

01:55:32.171 --> 01:55:33.737
Good-bye.

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.841
Come here, boy.
Come here.

01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:43.913
So, I guess I...

01:55:43.915 --> 01:55:44.980
I'll be going now.

01:55:44.982 --> 01:55:46.648
Yeah.
I can see that.

01:55:53.156 --> 01:55:54.488
Go.

01:55:54.490 --> 01:55:55.856
Come on.

01:56:00.996 --> 01:56:03.096
I love you.

01:57:12.698 --> 01:57:15.865
More than 20 minutes.

01:57:15.867 --> 01:57:17.600
If you're on the way to the airport,

01:57:17.602 --> 01:57:19.902
forget 101.
It's a mess.

01:57:19.904 --> 01:57:20.836
Take the 280.

01:57:20.838 --> 01:57:22.737
It should be smooth sailing from there.

01:57:22.739 --> 01:57:24.004
And that's it for traffic and weather

01:57:24.006 --> 01:57:26.339
on this rainy San Francisco night.

01:57:26.341 --> 01:57:27.973
Back to you, Dan.

01:57:27.975 --> 01:57:28.940
Thanks, Kelsey.

01:57:28.942 --> 01:57:30.675
Although union leaders are split...

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:49.125
Got your ticket, sir?

01:57:54.031 --> 01:57:55.830
You can check straight through.

01:57:55.832 --> 01:57:57.665
You're at gate number 7.

01:57:57.667 --> 01:57:59.533
Have a good trip.

01:58:25.227 --> 01:58:28.561
Ever consider Stanford?

01:58:38.272 --> 01:58:40.071
Yes.

01:58:40.073 --> 01:58:41.572
Yes.
