00:34.120 --> 00:39.889
Here's the deltoid, the first rib,
the second rib and the sternum.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.161
DAPHNE:
We're so proud of you, Fred.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.130
I haven't won yet, Daphne.
There's a lot of competition here.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.045
You're a shoo-in.
Who else has such an elaborate project...

00:55.200 --> 00:58.283
...demonstrating how to use
the laws of physics to trap a human being?

00:58.720 --> 01:01.485
Or a human being posing
as a scary supernatural monster?

01:05.120 --> 01:09.011
- I wish I was as confident as you two.
- Well, I have a good feeling.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.209
I have a feeling too. Mine's hunger.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.647
Like, how long do we have stand here,
Freddy?

01:14.800 --> 01:17.167
Like, the snack bar closes at 5.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.688
I need to do at least one dry run
and you two are my test dummies.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.320
Hey, who are you calling dummies?

01:23.480 --> 01:25.005
FRED:
Just a figure of speech.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.609
Just hang in there a few more seconds.
I'm almost done.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.449
Scooby fact: Heh, heh, heh. I love food.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.968
- Hey, Scoob, where are you going?
MELANIE: Whoa!

01:42.760 --> 01:48.369
Okay, here we go.
First, the magnet disarms the enemy.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.162
- Uh, Fred?
- Shaggy, why aren't you...?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.289
Hold on. Sorry, I coated the net
with a mixture of gum resins.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.327
You probably
don't care about that right now.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.806
If you wanted to get my attention,
you could've just said hello.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.242
- I'm Melanie Staples.
- Nice to meet you, Melanie. Fred Jones.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.811
And this is everybody else.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.526
SCOOBY:
Chicken wing?

02:21.200 --> 02:24.443
Staples?
Are you related to Dr. Ned Staples...

02:24.600 --> 02:27.490
...former astronaut
and now brilliant NASA scientist?

02:27.640 --> 02:32.123
Yes, he's my father. And actually, I'm late
for a demonstration of his latest invention.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.681
Hey, if you're not busy,
would you care to join me?

02:35.600 --> 02:39.321
Well, as interesting as that sounds, Melanie,
I'm afraid we couldn't possibly go...

02:39.480 --> 02:42.882
"because Fred has some more
work to do on his trap. Right, gang?

02:50.160 --> 02:52.162
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
former astronaut...

02:52.320 --> 02:56.450
...and lead scientist
at Houston Space Center, Dr. Ned Staples.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.811
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you
the latest in Mars exploration...

03:01.960 --> 03:05.009
...the amazing Mecha Mutt.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.249
Named so because of his obvious
resemblance to a very large canine.

03:24.200 --> 03:28.205
Just a few of his special features include
high-definition photography...

03:28.360 --> 03:30.931
...soil sample collecting, jet propulsion...

03:31.080 --> 03:35.881
...and computerized limbs that can climb
over any size rock on the planet Mars.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.601
I think he wants a doggy treat.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.725
He's not getting this one.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.566
That's strange.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.807
What's happening?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.240
My glasses.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.769
After him!

04:46.840 --> 04:49.491
Like, definitely not man's best friend.

04:49.640 --> 04:52.530
- Dad, what happened?
- I don't know.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.081
- His programming went haywire.
REPORTER 1: Dr. Staples.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.130
REPORTER 2: Dr. Staples, how do
you explain Mecha Mutt running amok?

04:58.280 --> 05:03.241
- Could it be the space specter?
- Space specter? What's she talking about?

05:03.400 --> 05:07.769
There's a mysterious legend
about an early manned mission years ago.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.129
<i>After passing through a strange space mist
on their way back to Earth...</i>

05:11.440 --> 05:13.488
<i>...the astronauts lost control
of their ship...</i>

05:13.640 --> 05:16.769
<i>...and Houston was at a loss
to explain what happened.</i>

05:16.920 --> 05:20.208
<i>Legend has it the ghostly spirit
came back in the ship's space capsule...</i>

05:20.800 --> 05:22.609
<i>...and has been haunting
NASA ever since.</i>

05:26.760 --> 05:30.242
Even today, when anything goes wrong,
everyone blames it on the space specter.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.804
It's a completely bogus story and I will not
dignify it by discussing it any further.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.201
Then how do you explain
Mecha Mutt's rampage?

05:38.360 --> 05:40.886
I, uh, have to get back to you on that.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.008
Sir, Mecha Mutt
seems to have disappeared...

05:43.160 --> 05:45.162
...but I have my men
surrounding the complex.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.767
- Dad, is there anything I can do?
- Not now, Melanie.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.771
I've never seen him so upset.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.288
I would be upset too if I lost
a multi-million dollar piece of hardware.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.171
If we don't figure out what went wrong,
my father's career...

05:57.320 --> 05:59.891
...not to mention the space program,
could be in jeopardy.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.486
Well, gang, it looks like
we have a mystery to solve.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.803
We should start by talking to all the people
who worked on Mecha Mutt.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.726
Well, there's Dr. Devon Albright and Irv,
my father's lab assistant.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.248
Maybe we should split up. Daphne
and I could talk to the lab assistant.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.049
- If you don't mind, I'd like to tag along.
- Nope. I really don't think--

06:18.200 --> 06:20.123
Sure. The more the merrier.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.648
Dr. Staples and I did a complete
diagnostics test of Mecha Mutt's system...

06:25.800 --> 06:27.086
...before the demonstration.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.082
We were up all night
checking everything...

06:31.240 --> 06:33.481
...so I can't imagine
why he suddenly went haywire.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.521
You want some rock candy, Melanie?
Sweets for the sweet.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.127
No, thank you, Irv.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.362
Sounds like Dr. Staples
worked you pretty hard.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.602
Is this your boyfriend, Melanie?

06:47.720 --> 06:51.042
- Oh, no. Fred's just a friend.
IRV: Oh.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.806
Well, the pleasure's all mine then, Fred.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.564
Sorry. Sticky hands.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.724
To answer your question, yes,
Dr. Staples keeps me so busy...

06:58.880 --> 07:02.282
...I don't even have time to date.
Something I think about all the time.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.201
But I put up with it
because he's like a father to me.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.523
Or perhaps one day, father-in-law.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.160
Okay, I think we're done here.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.730
Thanks, Irv. Come on.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.202
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.930
Well, apparently it doesn't matter.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.890
I don't get why everybody here
is falling all over themselves...

07:21.040 --> 07:22.929
...to get Melanie's attention.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.048
Did I just say that out loud?

07:27.800 --> 07:30.724
Where does a 20-foot robot
hide in this place?

07:30.880 --> 07:32.689
- Anywhere it wants.
- Anywhere it wants.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.048
- Good one, Scoob.
- Oh, boy.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.931
Come on, guys.
Dr. Albright's lab is down here.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.561
VELMA:
Shaggy, Scooby, wait.

07:57.600 --> 08:03.369
Like, are we in space, Scooby-Doo?
Because I am seeing stars.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.929
You can relax. This is not Mecha Mutt.
This is Rover 1.

08:09.080 --> 08:12.846
An early prototype. Designed by me.
I'm Dr. Devon Albright.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.049
But I thought Dr. Staples
invented the canine Mars rover.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.683
That's just what he lets people think.
But it was my idea.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.089
I worked years perfecting it.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.928
A two-man operated,
four-legged, all-terrain vehicle.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.207
I was on my way to developing a rover
that could be operated on Mars...

08:32.360 --> 08:34.361
...completely by wireless remote.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.047
But NASA allowed Dr. Staples
to take over my project...

08:38.200 --> 08:41.169
<i>...because he was a famous astronaut,
a national hero.</i>

08:41.320 --> 08:44.642
<i>What better way
to increase funds for the project?</i>

08:45.320 --> 08:50.121
And I? I was left with nothing.
But I'm not bitter.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.924
I know that sniff.
That's the sniff of deliciousness.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.244
Well, this must be
where the space guys hang out.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.890
Like, this must be what the
astronauts eat on their missions.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.246
Blueberry cheesecake.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.568
Maybe we should take some to sustain
ourselves on our mission, Scoob.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.643
Countdown to snack time. Heh, heh, heh.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.166
Biscuit?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.762
No! Ooh! Yes!

10:21.800 --> 10:23.848
We hit a dead end, Shaggy.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.045
SHAGGY:
How do you shut the doors?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.210
Like, down, boy?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.765
Hey, he's caught in the grate, hurry!

10:57.480 --> 10:59.482
Melanie said
she's gonna catch up with us...

10:59.640 --> 11:02.769
-...after she sees how her father is doing.
- Huh. She's so thoughtful.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.163
So far we've got two suspects
and two missing friends.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.129
- Sounds par for the course.
SHAGGY: Whoa!

11:08.280 --> 11:09.327
Do you hear that?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.561
I got this.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.526
Hey, are you two all right?

11:36.680 --> 11:39.684
Like, he won't be bothering
anyone ever again...

11:39.840 --> 11:44.289
...thanks to our
unusual ingenuity and, um, bravery.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.965
We're heroes.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.009
MELANIE:
What's going on? Where's Mecha--?

11:59.160 --> 12:01.891
Seriously?
There was no other place to jump?

12:06.440 --> 12:09.011
VELMA: What I'd like to know
is how you guys locked yourself...

12:09.160 --> 12:11.242
...in a wind tunnel
when the controls are here.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.131
- We didn't.
- Maybe it was the space specter.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.931
Well, if it was, he had sticky fingers.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.244
Mm. I was never anywhere
near the wind tunnel.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.851
- Candy?
- No, thank you.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.765
- So you were here the whole time?
- Of course.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.402
Dr. Staples works me so hard
I haven't been out of this lab in four days.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.567
He could hire another assistant
to help out but he doesn't and I know why.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.090
- Why?
- He's trying to keep Melanie and me apart.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.926
Irv, I don't think my father has any idea
how you feel. I know I didn't.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.970
How can he not?
It's written all over my face.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.529
I'll do anything to ensure that man
does not succeed in his quest...

12:52.680 --> 12:54.444
...to squash our budding relationship.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.771
Are you sure
you don't want some candy?

12:58.920 --> 13:00.490
VELMA:
Irv was telling the truth.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.530
According to this security footage,
he never once left the lab.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.286
So if Irv isn't controlling Mecha Mutt,
who is?

13:09.480 --> 13:10.561
What's happening?

13:11.240 --> 13:13.607
Mecha Mutt has blown out
the entire security network.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.524
You kids, stay here.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.365
I'll bet Mecha Mutt
is finally making his move to escape.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.000
If he does,
my father's career will leave with him.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.605
How can this be happening?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.604
Maybe someone has found a way
to override Dr. Staples' system...

13:25.760 --> 13:27.967
...and is operating
Mecha Mutt by remote control.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.771
- I agree.
- See, I'm just as smart as Melanie.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.847
Trust me, Daphne.
I'm not attracted to Melanie's brain.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.808
I mean, no, what I mean--
That didn't come out right.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.440
- So, like, what do we do now?
- We set a trap.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.366
And I think I know just the person
who can help us.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.807
Yes, all the Martian rovers contain the same
GPS system, even Mucky Mutt.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.804
If the system malfunctioned,
how would you find the rover then?

13:56.960 --> 13:59.566
It would automatically send out
a local emergency signal...

13:59.720 --> 14:02.769
...that could be picked up
by nearby space stations or other rovers.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.161
VELMA: Like that rover.
- I suppose.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.164
So we might be able to track down
Mecha Mutt with your rover.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.448
ALBRIGHT:
Except there's no one here to operate it.

14:10.600 --> 14:15.242
All non-essential personnel were ordered
to leave, including my two operators.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.449
- That's okay. We've got our own operators.
- Oh, no.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.364
SHAGGY: Every time. How do they
do this to us every time?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.841
SCOOBY:
I have no idea.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.483
Shaggy, Scooby, can you hear me?
We've linked in. Fred is ready at the crane.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.447
FRED: You just have to lure
Mecha Mutt to the magnet.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.844
DAPHNE: According to his signal,
he should be out there somewhere.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.889
Be careful, guys,
you're almost on top of him.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.003
There must be something wrong
with the signal because I don't see him.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.441
Me neither.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.082
SHAGGY: We should check out the kitchen.
SCOOBY: Yeah.

15:47.360 --> 15:52.048
- Over here. Bring him over here.
- Hold on. We're getting there.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.326
Unh. I thought all this iron
was supposed to protect you.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.802
We surrender.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.046
Hey, Scoob, I think he likes us
better on two feet.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.202
Yeah,two feet running.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.680
- Perfect, guys, he's coming right at you.
- And that's a good thing?

17:12.319 --> 17:13.765
Oh, no, he knows.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.721
He's getting away.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.201
Shaggy, you've got emergency boosters,
use them.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.489
Do I have to?

18:01.280 --> 18:02.691
Scooby Snacks.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.810
- Ha, ha. It worked.
GUARD: Nice work, kids.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.371
You stopped Mecha Mutt.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.126
You have a lot of explaining to do,
Dr. Staples.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.647
VELMA: Dr. Staples
is not the one responsible, sir.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.850
- The person behind this robot's antics is you.
MELANIE: Huh?

18:31.560 --> 18:33.801
Me? How could it be me?

18:33.960 --> 18:37.009
I suspected something was up
when we first met.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.764
<i>It was your hair band.</i>

18:38.920 --> 18:41.161
<i>It looked plastic, but it was metal.</i>

18:42.120 --> 18:44.327
See? It's packed with electronics.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.244
It's a cybernetic remote control.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.165
But what really got my mind going
was the sticky substance...

18:49.320 --> 18:51.243
...on the controls in the testing center.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.721
<i>It wasn't candy, but a gum resin.</i>

18:53.880 --> 18:57.805
<i>The same concoction Fred used
to make the netting of his trap sticky.</i>

18:57.960 --> 19:02.761
And the only one who ever came in contact
with the netting was you, Melanie.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.651
<i>You had it on your hands
when you locked Shaggy and Scooby...</i>

19:05.800 --> 19:07.484
<i>...in the wind tunnel with Mecha Mutt.</i>

19:09.560 --> 19:11.324
<i>You hid when you heard us coming...</i>

19:16.840 --> 19:20.811
<i>...and pretended to be just arriving on the
scene when we freed Shaggy and Scooby.</i>

19:21.240 --> 19:23.686
<i>That's why Mecha Mutt also knew
to avoid Fred's magnet.</i>

19:25.640 --> 19:28.211
- You were directing him.
- Melanie?

19:28.360 --> 19:31.045
Yes, it was me, Dad.
Why? Because of you.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.441
All my life, your work has come first.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.650
You've ignored and neglected me,
never once seeing just how brilliant I am.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.165
And conniving!

19:39.320 --> 19:41.607
Inside voice, Daphne.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.081
So I decided to show him
just how brilliant.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.562
If I had to destroy his career,
not to mention the entire space program...

19:47.720 --> 19:51.406
-...to get his attention, so be it.
- You are in big, big trouble, young lady.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.406
And I would've gotten away with it
if it wasn't for you meddling space cadets.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.450
If you ask me, we could have
wrapped this case up a lot sooner...

19:59.600 --> 20:04.162
...if you had all listened to me.
I never trusted her. Am I right?

20:05.320 --> 20:08.005
Second place, Fred.
You should be very happy.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.886
Hey, congratulations
on your first-place finish.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.610
What happened to Shaggy and Scooby?

20:15.760 --> 20:19.207
I think they went looking for more of that
space paste the astronauts eat.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.806
Like, I knew I could count on you to find
more delicious tasting goop, Scoob.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.202
Chicken fried steak.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.245
<i>MAN [ON PA]:
This is Mission Control.</i>

20:36.400 --> 20:39.324
<i>Prepare to launch three-month mission
to the International Space Station.</i>

20:39.480 --> 20:41.847
Oh, boy, sounds like
they're launching a rocket.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.889
- Should we go watch?
- Yeah.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.604
Scoob, I suddenly got a bad feeling.

21:03.305 --> 21:09.296
