He was found with a
bullet hole in his head,

16:05.215 --> 16:07.151
floating on the flint river.

16:07.185 --> 16:08.920
It's tragic.

16:08.953 --> 16:11.055
First time you're hearing this?

16:11.088 --> 16:14.925
No, but it's still...

16:14.959 --> 16:17.027
It's tragic.

16:19.963 --> 16:23.535
You ever see or talk
to any of the old crew?

16:23.568 --> 16:25.036
The old crew?

16:25.069 --> 16:26.971
Like George, for example.

16:27.003 --> 16:29.106
Or Trey Willis. Daniel Holden.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.042
Well, [Exhales deeply] I... I don't know

16:31.074 --> 16:34.011
that Daniel Holden was
ever a part of the old crew,

16:34.045 --> 16:36.347
or that there was even
an old crew. [Chuckles]

16:36.380 --> 16:38.016
But to your point, no,

16:38.049 --> 16:41.286
I haven't spoken to Daniel Holden since...

16:41.319 --> 16:42.487
Since high school.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.255
Did you know he'd gotten out of prison?

16:44.287 --> 16:45.522
I did, yes.

16:45.555 --> 16:47.391
What about Trey Willis?

16:47.425 --> 16:50.361
Uh, probably talked to
Trey 5 or 10 years ago.

16:50.393 --> 16:53.497
Not a very fine point.

16:53.531 --> 16:56.401
Well, time gets away from you
when you get older. [Chuckles]

16:56.434 --> 16:59.437
I guess so, since Trey's phone records show

16:59.469 --> 17:03.106
that he called you less
than two months ago.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.410
Well, that's true, but
h-he just left a message.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.478
We didn't have an actual conversation.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.546
What was the message?

17:09.579 --> 17:11.516
Just call him back.

17:11.548 --> 17:14.117
I never did.

17:14.151 --> 17:17.321
What about George?

17:17.354 --> 17:20.490
George called me about the same
time, I think, a-as Trey did.

17:20.523 --> 17:22.459
It looks like it was three days before,

17:22.492 --> 17:25.496
to put a real fine point on it, Chris.

17:25.528 --> 17:28.397
Was that an actual conversation?

17:28.431 --> 17:30.000
It was, yeah.

17:30.034 --> 17:31.603
And what the gist?

17:35.206 --> 17:36.324
To be Frank...

17:36.325 --> 17:37.442
Please.

17:37.475 --> 17:41.379
It was about Daniel Holden
getting out of prison.

17:41.411 --> 17:44.414
H-he... George was...

17:44.448 --> 17:47.185
He was agitated.

17:47.218 --> 17:49.019
Agitated?

17:49.053 --> 17:50.154
He was rambling, actually.

17:50.187 --> 17:53.190
Rambling about what?

17:53.224 --> 17:55.026
[Exhales deeply]

17:55.058 --> 17:59.162
I-I think he was worried
about, uh... Holden getting out.

17:59.196 --> 18:01.599
Why would he be worried about that?

18:01.632 --> 18:04.302
'Cause it brought up old feelings, I guess.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.638
Why would George call <i>
you</i> about old feelings?

18:06.670 --> 18:08.372
We had been friends, at one time.

18:08.405 --> 18:09.539
Was he worried that Holden might hurt him?

18:09.573 --> 18:11.109
I don't know, maybe.

18:11.141 --> 18:12.309
That Holden might shoot him in the head

18:12.343 --> 18:13.544
and toss him in the flint river?

18:13.576 --> 18:15.212
- That kind of worried?
- It's hard to say.

18:15.246 --> 18:17.547
'Cause that type of
suggestion's very damning, Chris.

18:17.581 --> 18:19.317
- And if it's not true...
- No, wait, wait, wait.

18:19.350 --> 18:21.319
Sheriff, I'm not suggesting that.

18:32.563 --> 18:35.600
What was George worried about, Chris?

18:35.632 --> 18:38.068
Really?

18:38.102 --> 18:39.304
Well...

18:47.344 --> 18:50.213
H-he didn't get into it with me.

18:50.247 --> 18:53.250
Didn't get into what he
was worried about with you?

18:53.284 --> 18:54.686
Unfortunately, no.

19:01.691 --> 19:05.295
Do you see yourself as a good man, Chris?

19:05.328 --> 19:07.297
A good man?

19:07.331 --> 19:08.533
In general.

19:10.401 --> 19:12.269
I don't know.

19:12.303 --> 19:19.243
I have a... a family
that I love... very much.

19:19.276 --> 19:22.479
And I work very hard to provide for them.

19:22.513 --> 19:24.515
Church-going man?

19:24.547 --> 19:26.651
Yeah. I go to church.

19:26.683 --> 19:30.387
Well, there's some positives
in the ledger, isn't there?

19:30.420 --> 19:34.225
I would hope so.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.661
Did you know it was almost 20 years

19:36.693 --> 19:40.364
before they tested that
DNA found on Hanna Dean?

19:40.398 --> 19:42.667
I knew it was a long time.

19:42.699 --> 19:45.402
Lucky there was still
something to test, really.

19:45.436 --> 19:48.406
Lot of that old evidence
gets lost or thrown out

19:48.439 --> 19:51.242
or sometimes just plain vanishes.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.978
Well, that was lucky.

19:55.446 --> 19:59.417
As you probably know, Holden was cleared.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.451
Was cleared?

20:01.485 --> 20:03.286
Of rape.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.556
His DNA wasn't found on Hanna.

20:05.589 --> 20:06.758
Right.

20:10.494 --> 20:12.731
That surprise you as much as it did me?

20:15.298 --> 20:18.435
Yeah, it was surprising.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.404
But then what really surprised me

20:20.438 --> 20:24.208
almost as much was... Trey Willis.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.477
He was cleared, too.

20:28.612 --> 20:31.449
Like to go ahead and clear you, too, Chris,

20:31.481 --> 20:33.283
while I'm in the neighborhood.

20:36.487 --> 20:40.224
Sheriff, don't take this the wrong way...

20:40.257 --> 20:42.259
But I think I should call a lawyer.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.764
Sure, Chris.

20:52.603 --> 20:55.206
No more, please.

20:55.238 --> 20:56.774

Plentiful.

21:17.628 --> 21:20.497
Sounds like a special fellow.

21:20.530 --> 21:25.368
Well, one tends to idealize after...
