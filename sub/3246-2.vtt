WEBVTT

00:20.354 --> 00:23.278
Come now, Father, you should know better.

00:23.565 --> 00:27.035
You're not welcome here,
and especially not today.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.533
I've got no time to start old arguments.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.958
- We want only one thing.
- And what would that be?

00:33.575 --> 00:36.795
- This house.
- You want the house?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.668
We will take the house.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.632
Would you like my wife while you're at it?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.252
If you won't stand aside,
then we'll take it by force.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.805
And by what power? The hand of God?

00:47.047 --> 00:50.347
No, the fist of man.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.161
In the name of Heaven.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.251
My Lady?

02:09.253 --> 02:12.884
What's in there? What is it?
What's under the canvas?

02:13.592 --> 02:16.436
Father, answer me. What's in there?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.726
May God forgive me.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.859
- What do you think of this? Will it do?
- The late 1970s?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.536
You'd be better off in a bin bag.
Hold on, listen to this.

03:16.196 --> 03:20.372
Ian Dury and The Blockheads.
Number one in 1979.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.373
You're a punk!

03:22.452 --> 03:23.669
♪ It's good to be a lunatic ♪

03:23.787 --> 03:28.338
That's what you are, a big old punk
with a bit of rockabilly thrown in.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.938
- Do you want to go and see him?
- How do you mean, in concert?

03:31.002 --> 03:32.299
What else is the Tardis for?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.473
I can take you to the Battle of Trafalgar,

03:34.589 --> 03:38.219
the First Antigravity Olympics,
Caesar crossing the Rubicon

03:38.301 --> 03:42.477
or Ian Dury at the Top Rank, Sheffield,
England, Earth, 21st November 1979,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.024
what do you think?

03:44.599 --> 03:46.818
- Sheffield it is!
- Hold on tight.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.953
Landing!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.672
1979! Hell of a year!

04:07.789 --> 04:11.714
China invades Vietnam.
The Muppet Movie, love that film.

04:11.835 --> 04:16.341
Margaret Thatcher. Skylab falls to Earth
with a little help from me.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.926
Nearly took off my thumb,
and I like my thumb.

04:19.009 --> 04:23.515
I need my thumb.
I'm very attached to... my thumb.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.478
1879. Same difference.

04:29.561 --> 04:33.361
You will explain your presence,
and the nakedness of this girl.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.994
- Are we in Scotland?
- How can you be ignorant of that?

04:37.068 --> 04:39.571
I'm dazed and confused.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.917
I've been chasing this wee naked child
over hill and over dale.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.871
Isn't that right, you timorous beastie?

04:47.370 --> 04:52.046
Och, aye.
I've been "oot" and "aboot."

04:52.125 --> 04:54.378
- No, don't do that.
- Hoots, mon?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.429
No, really don't. Really.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.674
Will you identify yourself, sir?

04:58.757 --> 05:03.684
I'm Doctor James McCrimmon
from the township of Balamory.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.565
I have my credentials, if I may?

05:12.729 --> 05:16.233
As you can see, a doctorate
from the University of Edinburgh.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.861
I trained under Doctor Bell himself.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.787
Let them approach.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.662
- I don't think that's wise, ma'am.
- Let them approach.

05:27.244 --> 05:31.465
You will approach the carriage,
and show all due deference.

05:44.469 --> 05:49.191
Rose, might I introduce
Her Majesty Queen Victoria,

05:49.307 --> 05:51.935
Empress of India and Defender of the Faith.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.858
Rose Tyler, ma'am.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.407
And my apologies for being so naked.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.361
I've had five daughters.
It's nothing to me.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.289
But you, Doctor, show me these credentials.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.333
Why didn't you say so immediately?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.210
It states clearly here

06:12.289 --> 06:15.418
that you have been appointed
by the Lord Provost as my protector.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.466
Does it? Yes, it does. Good. Good.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.891
Erm, then let me ask,
why is Your Majesty travelling by road

06:22.966 --> 06:25.310
when there's a train
all the way to Aberdeen?

06:25.427 --> 06:29.182
- A tree on the line.
- An accident?

06:29.639 --> 06:33.189
I am the Queen of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland.

06:33.268 --> 06:37.648
- Everything around me tends to be planned.
- An assassination attempt?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.488
What, seriously?
There's people out to kill you?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.366
I'm quite used to staring down
the barrel of a gun.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.831
Sir Robert MacLeish
lives but 10 miles hence.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.375
We've sent word ahead.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.335
He'll shelter us for tonight,
then we can reach Balmoral tomorrow.

06:51.453 --> 06:55.879
This Doctor and his timorous beastie
will come with us.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.342
Yes, ma'am.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.590
We'd better get moving.
It's almost nightfall.

06:59.669 --> 07:04.220
Indeed, and there are stories of wolves
in these parts.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.553
Fanciful tales,
intended to scare the children,

07:07.677 --> 07:10.681
but good for the blood, I think. Drive on.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.852
It's funny, though,
'cause you say assassination,

07:15.936 --> 07:18.985
and you just think of Kennedy and stuff,
not her.

07:19.105 --> 07:23.906
1879?
She's had, oh, six attempts on her life.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.950
And I'll tell you something else.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.781
- We just met Queen Victoria.
- I know!

07:27.864 --> 07:29.624
- What a laugh!
- She was just sitting there!

07:29.699 --> 07:34.000
- Like a stamp.
- I want her to say, "We are not amused."

07:34.079 --> 07:36.081
I bet you 5 quid I can make her say it.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.208
Well, if I gambled on that,

07:38.291 --> 07:40.510
it would be an abuse of my privilege
as a traveller in time.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.178
- 10 quid.
- Done.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.393
I can't do this. It's treason.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.401
Then your wife
will suffer the consequences.

08:01.064 --> 08:04.614
Believe me, Sir Robert,
she will be devoured.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.013
- Your Majesty.
- Sir Robert.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.934
My apologies for the emergency.
And how is Lady Isobel?

08:29.009 --> 08:32.229
She's indisposed, I'm afraid.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.726
She's gone to Edinburgh for the season,

08:35.140 --> 08:38.110
and she's taken the cook with her,
the kitchens are barely stocked.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.687
I wouldn't blame Your Majesty
if you wanted to ride on.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.865
Not at all.
I've had quite enough carriage exercise,

08:43.940 --> 08:48.537
and this is charming, if rustic.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.455
It's my first visit to this house.

08:51.698 --> 08:55.794
My late husband spoke of it often,
the Torchwood Estate.

08:57.162 --> 09:02.259
Now, shall we go inside?
And please excuse the naked girl.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.212
- Sorry!
- She's a feral child.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.764
I bought her for sixpence
in old London town.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.432
It was her or the Elephant Man, so...

09:09.507 --> 09:14.104
Thinks he's funny, but I'm so not amused.
What do you think, ma'am?

09:14.304 --> 09:17.683
It hardly matters. Shall we proceed?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.985
So close.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.281
Mackeson and Ramsay,
you will escort the property. Hurry up.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.499
So what's in there, then?

09:34.574 --> 09:39.000
Property of the Crown.
You will dismiss any further thoughts, sir.

09:39.871 --> 09:44.342
The rest of you, go to the rear of the house.
Assume the designated positions.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.508
- You heard the orders, positions.
- Sir.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.927
You two, come with me...

10:14.114 --> 10:15.582
Guard it with your life.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.334
This, I take it, is the famous endeavour.

10:25.667 --> 10:30.047
All my father's work.
Built by hand in his final years.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.300
It became something of an obsession.
He spent his money on this,

10:33.383 --> 10:35.886
rather than caring for
the house or himself.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.142
I wish I'd met him. I like him.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.982
- That thing's beautiful, can I...
- Help yourself.

10:41.099 --> 10:44.228
- What did he model it on?
- I know nothing about it.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.903
To be honest,

10:45.979 --> 10:48.732
most of us thought him a little,
shall we say, eccentric.

10:51.693 --> 10:55.914
I wish now I'd spent more time with him
and listened to his stories.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.826
It's a bit rubbish.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.458
How many prisms has it got?
Way too many!

11:02.579 --> 11:05.628
The magnification's gone right over the top.
That's a stupid kind of...

11:05.707 --> 11:06.924
- Am I being rude again?
- Yep!

11:07.000 --> 11:10.220
But it's pretty! It's very pretty.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.764
And the imagination of it
should be applauded.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.101
Hmm. I thought you might disapprove,
Your Majesty.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.931
Stargazing. Isn't that a bit fanciful?

11:20.597 --> 11:24.943
You could easily not be amused,
or something. No?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.944
This device surveys
the infinite work of God.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.741
What could be finer?

11:32.442 --> 11:34.991
Sir Robert's father was an example
to us all,

11:35.069 --> 11:38.869
a polymath,
steeped in astronomy and the sciences,

11:38.990 --> 11:42.460
yet equally well-versed
in folklore and fairytales.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.251
Stars and magic. I like him more and more.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.467
Oh, my late husband enjoyed his company.

11:50.418 --> 11:54.889
Prince Albert himself was acquainted
with many rural superstitions,

11:54.964 --> 11:56.807
coming as he did from Saxe-Coburg.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.385
That's Bavaria.

11:59.969 --> 12:04.975
When Albert was told about your local wolf,
he was transported.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.064
So what's this wolf, then?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.446
- It's just a story.
- Then tell it.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.070
- It's said that...
- Excuse me, sir.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.828
Perhaps Her Majesty's party
could repair to their rooms.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.826
It's almost dark.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.581
Of course. Yes, of course.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.007
And then supper.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.878
And could we find some clothes
for Miss Tyler?

12:33.670 --> 12:38.176
- I'm tired of nakedness.
- It's not amusing, is it?

12:40.343 --> 12:43.517
Sir Robert, your wife
must have left some clothes. See to it.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.146
We shall dine at 7:00,
and talk some more of this wolf.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.188
After all, there is a full moon tonight.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.149
So there is, ma'am.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.851
They came through the house in silence.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.529
They took the steward and the master,
and my lady.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.824
Listen, I've got a friend.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.027
He's called the Doctor.
He'll know what to do.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.283
- You've got to come with me.
- Oh, but I can't, Miss.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.283
- What's your name?
- Flora.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.373
Flora, we'll be safe.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.972
There's more people arrived downstairs,
soldiers and everything.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.292
They can help us. I promise.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.966
Come on. Okay? Come on.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.310
Oh, Miss, I did warn you.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.366
He's not dead, I don't think.
He must be drugged or something.

15:11.452 --> 15:15.457
Your companion begs an apology, Doctor.
Her clothing has somewhat delayed her.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.668
Oh, that's all right.
Save her a wee bit of ham.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.173
The feral child could probably eat it raw.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.559
- Very wise, ma'am. Very witty.
- Slightly witty, perhaps.

15:26.008 --> 15:30.684
I know you rarely get the chance to dine
with me, Captain, but don't get too excited.

15:31.514 --> 15:35.860
I shall contain my wit
in case I do you further injury.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.812
Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.899
Besides, we're all waiting on Sir Robert.
Come, sir.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.735
- You promised us a tale of nightmares.
- Indeed.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.699
Since my husband's death,

15:45.820 --> 15:48.915
I find myself with more of a taste
for supernatural fiction.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.996
You must miss him.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.377
Very much.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.458
Oh, completely.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.553
And that's the charm of a ghost story,
isn't it?

16:02.670 --> 16:05.173
Not the scares and chills,
that's just for children,

16:05.256 --> 16:10.387
but the hope of some contact
with the great beyond.

16:11.471 --> 16:16.068
We all want some message from that place.

16:16.893 --> 16:21.148
It's the Creator's greatest mystery
that we're allowed no such consolation.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.576
The dead stay silent,

16:28.529 --> 16:30.156
and we must wait.

16:34.494 --> 16:39.671
Come, begin your tale, Sir Robert.
There's a chill in the air.

16:39.999 --> 16:44.175
The wind is howling through the eaves.
Tell us of monsters.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.433
Don't make a sound.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.806
They said if we scream or shout,
then he will slaughter us.

16:53.888 --> 16:58.860
But he's in a cage. He's a prisoner.
He's the same as us.

16:58.935 --> 17:03.987
He's nothing like us.
That creature is not mortal.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.290
The story goes back 300 years.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.295
Every full moon,
the howling rings through the valley.

17:17.619 --> 17:22.797
Next morning, livestock is found
ripped apart and devoured.

17:23.041 --> 17:27.718
Oh, tales like this just disguise
the work of thieves.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.891
Steal the sheep and blame a wolf,
simple as that.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.515
But sometimes a child goes missing.

17:33.302 --> 17:37.352
Once in a generation,
a boy will vanish from his homestead.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.152
Don't, child.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.199
- Who are you?
- Don't enrage him.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.953
Where are you from? You're not from Earth.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.122
What planet are you from?

18:01.205 --> 18:05.301
Oh... intelligence.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.172
- Where were you born?
- This body?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.554
Ten miles away.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.895
A weakling, heartsick boy,

18:16.178 --> 18:20.809
stolen away at night by the Brethren
for my cultivation.

18:22.268 --> 18:26.614
I carved out his soul and sat in his heart.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.610
- Are there descriptions of the creature?
- Oh, yes, Doctor.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.321
Drawings and wood carvings.

18:34.530 --> 18:38.376
And it's not merely a wolf,
it's more than that.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.543
This is a man who becomes an animal.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.717
A werewolf?

18:47.376 --> 18:50.300
All right, so the body's human.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.926
What about you, the thing inside?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.558
So far from home.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.482
If you want to get back home, we can help.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.568
Why would I leave this place?

19:04.769 --> 19:08.990
A world of industry,
of workforce and warfare.

19:09.899 --> 19:14.496
- I could turn it to such purpose.
- How would you do that?

19:14.904 --> 19:17.748
I would migrate to the Holy Monarch.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.872
You mean Queen Victoria?

19:20.076 --> 19:23.922
With one bite, I would pass into her blood.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.760
And then it begins, the Empire of the Wolf.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.800
So many questions.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.262
Look! Inside your eyes.
You've seen it, too.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.437
Seen what?

19:40.513 --> 19:43.517
The wolf.
There is something of the wolf about you.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.237
I don't know what you mean.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.611
Oh, you burn like the sun,

19:51.732 --> 19:55.111
but all I require is the moon.

19:58.864 --> 20:03.119
My father didn't treat it as a story.
He said it was fact.

20:03.786 --> 20:07.586
He even claimed to have communed with
the beast, to have learned its purpose.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.509
I should have listened.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.760
His work was hindered. He made enemies.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.183
There's a monastery
in the Glen of St Catherine.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.678
The Brethren
opposed my father's investigations.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.105
Perhaps they thought his work ungodly.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.104
That's what I thought, but now I wonder.

20:28.018 --> 20:31.989
What if they had a different reason
for wanting the story kept quiet?

20:32.314 --> 20:37.036
What if they turned from God
and worshipped the wolf?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.956
And what if they were with us right now?

20:49.707 --> 20:51.584
Moonlight.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.523
All of you, stop looking at him.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.202
Flora, don't look, listen to me.
Grab hold of the chain and pull!

21:18.277 --> 21:20.996
Come on, with me! Pull!

21:23.032 --> 21:27.253
I said pull! Stop your whining
and listen to me! All of yous!

21:27.369 --> 21:31.374
And that means you, your Ladyship.
Now, come on! Pull!

21:31.874 --> 21:34.218
- What is the meaning of this?
- Explain yourself, sir.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.761
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
they've got my wife.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.179
Rose, where's Rose? Where is she?

21:38.380 --> 21:39.882
Sir Robert, come on!

21:50.226 --> 21:51.899
Three, pull!

21:52.394 --> 21:57.195
One, two, three, pull!

21:57.274 --> 22:00.198
Tell me, sir.
I demand to know your intention.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.706
What is it that you want?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.461
The throne.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.714
Two, three, pull!

22:21.715 --> 22:25.970
One, two, three,

22:26.762 --> 22:28.435
Dull!

22:34.770 --> 22:36.738
Where the hell have you been?

22:39.733 --> 22:42.452
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Isobel!

22:44.071 --> 22:49.202
Get out, all of you! Come on!
Out! Out! Out!

23:02.631 --> 23:06.101
I take it, sir, that you halted my train
to bring me here.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.019
We've waited so long

23:08.137 --> 23:10.231
for one of your journeys
to coincide with the moon.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.149
Then you have waited in vain.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.445
After six attempts on my life,

23:17.813 --> 23:20.032
I am hardly unprepared.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.070
Oh, I don't think so, woman.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.078
The correct form of address
is "Your Majesty".

23:29.867 --> 23:31.289
- Guns.
- I need five.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.247
Lady Isobel, take the girls!
Get them out through the kitchen.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.377
Jackson, at arms...

23:35.497 --> 23:37.044
I can't leave you. What will you do?

23:37.124 --> 23:40.628
I must defend Her Majesty.
Now, don't think of me, just go.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.594
All of you at my side! Come on!

23:44.965 --> 23:46.433
Could be any form of
light-modulating species

23:46.508 --> 23:48.727
triggered by specific wavelengths.
Did it say what it wanted?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.472
The Queen, the crown, the throne,
you name it.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.381
Fire! Fire!

24:28.050 --> 24:31.771
- It won't open. They've sealed us in.
- Oh, my lady, look.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.561
They'll never let us out.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.151
- They mean for us to die.
- Don't say that, Flora!

24:37.226 --> 24:39.626
All right, you men,
we should retreat upstairs. Come with me.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.822
I'll not retreat. The battle's done.

24:41.897 --> 24:45.151
There's no creature on God's earth
could survive such an assault.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.861
I'm telling you, come upstairs!

24:46.944 --> 24:48.571
And I'm telling you, sir,

24:48.696 --> 24:52.075
I will sleep well tonight
with that thing's hide upon my wall.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.087
It must have crawled away to die.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.420
There's nothing we can do!

25:07.423 --> 25:08.925
No!

25:12.928 --> 25:14.305
Did they kill it?

25:15.222 --> 25:17.941
Come close.

25:52.509 --> 25:57.060
- Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
- Sir Robert, what's happening?

25:57.598 --> 25:59.225
I heard such terrible noises.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.561
Your Majesty, we've got to get out.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.484
But what of Father Angelo,
is he still here?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.274
Captain Reynolds disposed of him.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.324
The front door's no good.
It's been boarded shut.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.654
Pardon me, Your Majesty,
you'll have to leg it out of a window.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.707
Excuse my manners, ma'am,

26:18.786 --> 26:21.335
but I shall go first,
the better to assist Her Majesty's egress.

26:21.455 --> 26:22.923
A noble sentiment, my Sir Walter Raleigh.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.296
Yeah, any chance you could hurry up?

26:31.965 --> 26:34.059
I reckon the monky-boys
want us to stay inside.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.350
- Do they know who I am?
- Yea h, that's why they want you.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.474
The wolf's lined you up for a biting.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.982
Now, stop this talk.
There can't be an actual wolf.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.783
- What do we do?
- We run.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.584
- Is that it?
- You got any silver bullets?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.283
- Not on me, no.
- There we are, then. We run.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.368
Your Majesty, as a doctor,
I recommend a vigorous jog,

26:59.451 --> 27:00.919
good for the health.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.398
Come on. Come on.

27:39.950 --> 27:43.420
I'll take this position and hold it.
You keep moving, for God's sake.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.999
Your Majesty, I went to look
for the property and it was taken.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.256
- The chest was empty.
- I have it. It's safe.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.470
Then remove yourself, ma'am.

27:52.546 --> 27:55.265
Doctor, you stand
as Her Majesty's protector.

27:55.424 --> 28:00.021
And you, Sir Robert.
You're a traitor to the Crown.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.315
- Bullets can't stop it.
- They'll buy you time. Now, run!

28:24.494 --> 28:25.837
Rose!

28:28.081 --> 28:29.799
Barricade the door.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.309
Wait a minute. Shh. Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.639
It stopped.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.328
It's gone.

29:03.825 --> 29:04.917
Listen.

29:13.961 --> 29:17.636
- Is this the only door?
- Yes.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.470
No!

29:26.431 --> 29:27.899
Shh!

29:47.035 --> 29:50.084
I don't understand. What's stopping it?

29:53.917 --> 29:55.885
Something inside this room.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.598
What is it? Why can't it get in?

30:00.757 --> 30:03.681
- I tell you what, though.
- What?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.888
- Werewolf.
- I know!

30:08.598 --> 30:10.771
- You all right?
- I'm okay, yeah.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.815
I'm sorry, ma'am.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.982
It's all my fault.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.784
I should have sent you away.

30:21.028 --> 30:25.204
I tried to suggest something was wrong.
I thought you might notice.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.957
Did you think there was nothing strange
about my household staff?

30:29.036 --> 30:30.754
Well, they were bald, athletic.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.548
Your wife's away,
I just thought you were happy.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.961
I'll tell you what though, ma'am,
I bet you're not amused now.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.299
- Do you think this funny?
- No, ma'am, I'm sorry.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.351
What, exactly, I pray,
tell me, someone, please,

30:44.426 --> 30:47.396
what exactly is that creature?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.227
You'd call it a werewolf,

30:49.306 --> 30:51.980
but technically it's more
of a lupine-wavelength haemovariform.

30:52.059 --> 30:56.610
And should I trust you, sir?
You, who change your voice so easily?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.778
What happened to your accent?

30:59.441 --> 31:02.320
- Oh, right, sorry, that...
- I'll not have it.

31:02.778 --> 31:07.158
No, sir. Not you, not
that thing, none of it.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.954
This is not my world.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.209
Mistletoe.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.421
They're all garlanded in mistletoe
and the wolf doesn't attack them.

31:21.421 --> 31:25.221
- Who brought this into the kitchen?
- Must have been the Brethren.

31:25.884 --> 31:30.014
Gather it up, quickly.
Every last scrap. Quick, now!

31:35.811 --> 31:37.154
Mistletoe.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.321
Sir Robert, did your father put that there?

31:41.817 --> 31:43.865
I don't know. I suppose.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.867
And on the other door, too.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.327
Though a carving wouldn't be enough.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.333
I wonder.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.705
Viscum album, the oil of the mistletoe.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.506
It's been worked into the wood
like a varnish.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.959
How clever was your dad? I love him!

31:59.042 --> 32:01.966
Powerful stuff, mistletoe,
bursting with lectins and viscotoxins.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.165
- And the wolf's allergic to it?
- Or it thinks it is.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.091
The monky-monk-monks need a way
of controlling the wolf,

32:06.174 --> 32:07.926
maybe they trained it
to react against certain things.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.603
Nevertheless,
that creature won't give up, Doctor,

32:10.679 --> 32:13.148
and we still don't possess
an actual weapon.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.271
Oh, your father got all the brains,
didn't he?

32:15.350 --> 32:18.103
- Being rude again.
- Good, I meant that one.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.860
You want weapons?
We're in a library. Books!

32:21.398 --> 32:23.696
Best weapons in the world.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.113
This room is the greatest arsenal
we could have.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.582
Arm yourself.

32:33.702 --> 32:37.252
There's no sound of the wolf, my lady,
perhaps it's gone.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.424
And perhaps it's toying with us.

32:39.499 --> 32:40.967
But my husband's up there,

32:41.042 --> 32:44.637
and if there's any chance he's still alive,
then, by God, I'll assist him.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.853
Look up biology and zoology.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.726
- There might be something on wolves.
- What about this?

32:53.889 --> 32:56.187
- A whole book on mistletoe.
- "The application of gunpowder..."

32:56.266 --> 32:59.315
- If we could build some form of explosive.
- Hmm, that's the sort of thing.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.771
Ohhh.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.739
Look what your old dad found.
Something fell to Earth.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.320
- A spaceship?
- Shooting star.

33:08.737 --> 33:13.038
"In the year of our Lord 1540,
under the reign of King James V,"

33:13.116 --> 33:15.869
"an almighty fire did burn in the pit."

33:16.328 --> 33:18.877
That's the Glen of Saint Catherine,
just by the monastery.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.925
But that's over 300 years ago.
What's it been waiting for?

33:22.000 --> 33:25.925
Maybe just a single cell survived.
Adapting slowly down the generations,

33:26.004 --> 33:29.804
it survived through the humans,
host after host after host.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.347
But why does it want the throne?

33:31.426 --> 33:35.897
That's what it wants, it said so.
The Empire of the Wolf.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.768
Imagine it. The Victorian Age accelerated.

33:40.644 --> 33:44.490
Starships and missiles fuelled by coal
and driven by steam,

33:45.941 --> 33:48.615
leaving history devastated in its wake.

33:49.361 --> 33:54.538
- Sir Robert. If I am to die here...
- Don't say that, Your Majesty.

33:55.116 --> 33:59.792
I would destroy myself
rather than let that creature infect me,

33:59.955 --> 34:01.127
but that's no matter.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.800
I ask only that you find
some place of safekeeping

34:03.959 --> 34:07.509
for something far older
and more precious than myself.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.885
Hardly the time
to worry about your valuables.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.967
Thank you for your opinion,

34:12.842 --> 34:15.937
but there is nothing
more valuable than this.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.724
Oh, Your Majesty.

34:21.226 --> 34:24.480
- Is that the Koh-i-noor?
- Oh, yes.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.741
The greatest diamond in the world.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.989
Given to me as the spoils of war.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.449
Perhaps its legend is now coming true.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.784
It is said that whoever owns it
must surely die.

34:36.866 --> 34:40.416
Well, that's true of anything,
if you wait long enough. Can I?

34:49.004 --> 34:52.053
- That is so beautiful.
- How much is that worth?

34:52.172 --> 34:56.974
They say, the wages of the entire planet
for a whole week.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.638
Good job my mum's not here,

34:58.722 --> 35:01.322
she'd be fighting the wolf off
with her bare hands for that thing.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.102
- And she'd win.
- Where is the wolf?

35:05.520 --> 35:08.820
- I don't trust this silence.
- Why do you travel with it?

35:09.190 --> 35:10.817
My annual pilgrimage.

35:10.900 --> 35:16.122
I'm taking it to Hellier and Carew,
the Royal jewellers at Hazlehead.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.451
The stone needs recutting.

35:18.992 --> 35:22.337
- But it's perfect.
- My late husband never thought so.

35:22.412 --> 35:23.914
Now, there's a fact.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.299
Prince Albert kept on having
the Koh-i-noor cut down.

35:26.374 --> 35:30.129
It used to be 40% bigger than this,
but he was never happy.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.088
Kept on cutting and cutting.

35:32.213 --> 35:36.684
He always said
the shine was not quite right,

35:37.344 --> 35:40.393
but he died with it still unfinished.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.647
Unfinished.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.397
Oh, yes!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.232
There's a lot of unfinished business
in this house.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.817
His father's research
and your husband, ma'am.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.743
He came here
and he sought the perfect diamond.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.986
Hold on, oh, hold on.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.322
All these separate things,

35:56.404 --> 35:57.747
they're not separate at all,
they're connected.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.039
Oh, my head, my head!

35:59.115 --> 36:01.834
What if this house... It's a trap for you.
Is that right, ma'am?

36:01.910 --> 36:04.071
- Obviously.
- At least, that's what the wolf intended,

36:04.079 --> 36:06.298
but what if there's a trap inside the trap?

36:06.414 --> 36:07.757
Explain yourself, Doctor.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.923
What if his father and your husband
weren't just telling each other stories.

36:11.044 --> 36:14.014
They dared to imagine all this was true,
and they planned against it.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.969
Laying the real trap not for you,
but for the wolf.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.189
That wolf, there.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.941
Out! Out! Out! Out!

36:32.899 --> 36:34.446
Your Majesty!

36:40.281 --> 36:42.500
We've got to get to the observatory!

36:50.458 --> 36:53.211
- Good shot!
- It was mistletoe.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.637
Isobel.

36:56.005 --> 36:59.384
- Now get back downstairs.
- Keep yourself safe.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.683
My love. Now, go.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.931
Girls, come with me.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.312
Down the back stairs
back to the kitchens, quickly.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.476
Come on.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.778
The observatory is this way.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.326
No mistletoe on these doors,

37:24.451 --> 37:25.919
'cause your father wanted
the wolf to get inside.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.962
I just need time.
Is there any way of barricading this?

37:28.037 --> 37:29.254
Do your work, and I'll defend it.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.253
If we could bind them shut
with rope or something...

37:31.332 --> 37:34.836
I said I'll find you time, sir.
Now, get inside.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.843
Good man.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.175
Your Majesty, the diamond.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.353
- For what purpose?
- The purpose it was designed for.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.114
Rose.

37:57.567 --> 37:58.944
Lift it, come on.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.911
- Not the right time for stargazing.
- Yes, it is.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.346
I committed treason for you,

38:19.798 --> 38:23.769
but now my wife
will remember me with honour.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.649
I am the Defender of the Faith,
and that Faith shall defend me.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.154
You said this thing doesn't work.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.675
It doesn't work as a telescope,
'cause that's not what it is.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.413
It's a light chamber.
It magnifies the light, like a weapon.

38:44.531 --> 38:48.331
- We've just got to power it up.
- With what? There's no electricity.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.540
Moonlight. But the wolf needs moonlight.
It's made by moonlight.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.968
You're 70% water, you can still drown.
Come on!

39:01.422 --> 39:02.639
Come on!

39:43.798 --> 39:46.517
Make it brighter. Let me go.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.348
Your Majesty?

40:28.885 --> 40:30.307
Did it bite you?

40:30.511 --> 40:34.357
No, it's... It's a cut, that's all.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.936
If that thing bit you...

40:39.020 --> 40:42.900
It was a splinter of wood
when the door came apart. It's nothing.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.865
- Let me see.
- It is nothing.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.131
By the power invested in me
by the Church and the State,

40:58.206 --> 41:03.053
I dub thee Sir Doctor of Tardis.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.886
By the power invested in me
by the Church and the State,

41:07.006 --> 41:12.388
I dub thee Dame Rose of the Powell Estate.

41:12.637 --> 41:13.889
You may stand.

41:15.390 --> 41:16.562
Many thanks, ma'am.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.440
Thanks. They're never gonna believe this
back home.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.312
Your Majesty, you said last night

41:21.396 --> 41:24.195
about receiving no message
from the great beyond.

41:24.774 --> 41:27.778
I think your husband cut that diamond
to save your life.

41:27.902 --> 41:31.657
He's protecting you even now, ma'am,
from beyond the grave.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.741
Indeed.

41:33.825 --> 41:38.672
Then you may think on this also,
that I am not amused.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.749
Yes!

41:40.957 --> 41:44.427
Not remotely amused.

41:44.794 --> 41:48.344
And henceforth, I banish you.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.262
I'm sorry?

41:50.383 --> 41:52.260
I have rewarded you, Sir Doctor,

41:52.343 --> 41:56.439
and now you are exiled from this Empire,
never to return.

41:58.558 --> 42:02.608
I don't know what you are, the two of you,
or where you're from,

42:03.438 --> 42:08.069
but I know that you consort
with stars and magic, and think it fun.

42:08.651 --> 42:13.157
But your world is steeped in terror
and blasphemy and death,

42:13.281 --> 42:15.830
and I will not allow it.

42:16.284 --> 42:20.289
You will leave these shores,
and you will reflect, I hope,

42:20.413 --> 42:25.169
on how you came to stray so far
from all that is good,

42:25.501 --> 42:29.881
and how much longer
you may survive this terrible life.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.812
Now leave my world,

42:36.804 --> 42:39.523
and never return.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.611
- Whoa!
- Cheers!

42:45.521 --> 42:46.989
- Walk on.
- No, but the funny thing is,

42:47.065 --> 42:49.238
Queen Victoria actually did suffer
a mutation of the blood.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.326
It's historical record.
She was haemophiliac.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.745
They used to call it the Royal Disease,

42:52.820 --> 42:55.073
but it's always been a mystery
because she didn't inherit it.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.783
Her mum didn't have it.
Her dad didn't have it.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.494
- It came from nowhere.
- What, and you're saying that's a wolf bite?

42:59.577 --> 43:02.751
Well, maybe haemophilia is
just a Victorian euphemism.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.503
- For werewolf?
- Could be.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.168
- Queen Victoria's a werewolf?
- Could be.

43:07.251 --> 43:11.552
And her children had the Royal Disease.
Maybe she gave them a quick nip.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.884
- So the Royal Family are werewolves?
- Well, maybe not yet.

43:14.967 --> 43:19.347
I mean, a single wolf cell could take
100 years to mature.

43:19.472 --> 43:23.568
Might be ready by, oh, early 21st century.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.816
No, that's just ridiculous.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.407
- Mind you, Princess Anne.
- I'll say no more.

43:29.774 --> 43:33.529
And if you think about it,
they're very private.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.534
They plan everything in advance.

43:35.655 --> 43:39.159
They could schedule themselves
around the moon. We'd never know.

43:39.242 --> 43:43.213
And they like hunting.
They love blood sports.

43:44.372 --> 43:47.342
Oh, my God! They're werewolves!

43:56.467 --> 43:58.390
What will you do? Will you stay here?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.563
I don't think I could.

44:02.932 --> 44:06.857
I'd sell it, or pull this place down.

44:11.399 --> 44:15.996
Although we may not speak of these events
in public, they will not be forgotten.

44:16.237 --> 44:17.739
I promise you that.

44:18.573 --> 44:23.170
Your husband's sacrifice,
the ingenuity of his father,

44:23.828 --> 44:25.080
they will live on.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.581
But how?

44:27.248 --> 44:28.795
I saw, last night,

44:28.875 --> 44:32.880
that Great Britain has enemies
beyond imagination,

44:32.962 --> 44:36.262
and we must defend our borders
on all sides.

44:37.842 --> 44:40.937
I propose an institute

44:41.262 --> 44:44.857
to investigate these strange happenings
and to fight them.

44:46.350 --> 44:51.447
I would call it Torchwood.
The Torchwood Institute.

44:51.522 --> 44:55.948
And if this Doctor should return,
then he should beware,

44:56.485 --> 44:59.113
because Torchwood will be waiting.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.208
Good morning, class.

45:06.579 --> 45:07.660
Are we sitting comfortably?

45:08.915 --> 45:11.435
Three months ago, turns out
all the kitchen staff were replaced.

45:11.459 --> 45:14.133
See? There's definitely something going on.
I was right to call you home.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.551
May i introduce Miss Sarah Jane Smith.

45:16.631 --> 45:18.008
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you!

45:18.090 --> 45:19.387
Yes. Very nice.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.641
You are not permitted to leave your station
during a sitting.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.724
Boy in class this morning,
got knowledge way beyond planet Earth.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.352
K9!

45:29.477 --> 45:34.233
Our time has come, my brothers.
Today we shall become gods.
