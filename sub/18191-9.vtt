WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.669
PREVIOUSLY
ON "CHASING LIFE..."

00:02.702 --> 00:04.205
I THINK YOU
SHOULD TAKE IT.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.339
YOU'LL REALLY BE COOL
WITH ME LEAVING FOR THAT LONG?

00:05.373 --> 00:06.774
I TOOK THE JOB.

00:07.006 --> 00:08.509
- SO YOU WANNA
TAKE A BREAK?
- I JUST DON'T WANT US

00:08.541 --> 00:10.176
TO START RESENTING
EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

00:10.211 --> 00:12.679
BOYFRIEND, GIRLFRIEND,
SHOULD WE MAKE IT OFFICIAL?

00:12.712 --> 00:13.680
OR NOT?

00:13.714 --> 00:15.282
I DON'T THINK
THAT I'M READY

00:15.316 --> 00:17.184
FOR THAT YET.

00:17.217 --> 00:18.219
I WAS DRIVING.

00:18.251 --> 00:19.586
YOU CANNOT KEEP CARRYING

00:19.620 --> 00:20.620
THAT WEIGHT AROUND.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.356
IT'LL CRUSH YOU.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.760
Leo: I'M NOT GETTING
THE SURGERY

00:26.794 --> 00:28.195
TO TRY AND REMOVE
THE TUMOR.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.698
SO "MR. YOU GOTTA LIVE"
IS JUST GIVING UP?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.198
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD DO WELL

00:32.232 --> 00:34.701
AS A BRAIN-DEAD
HOSPITAL PATIENT?

00:34.734 --> 00:36.070
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS QUITTING.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.405
I'M GONNA FIGHT.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.372
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO START CHEMO TODAY,

00:39.406 --> 00:42.176
BUT I SAW
A FERTILITY DOCTOR INSTEAD.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.746
SO TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE TRIP TO FLORIDA.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.215
WHAT'S THE ECO CLUB LIKE?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.649
KINDA WHAT YOU'D EXPECT.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.518
LITTERING BAD,
RECYCLING GOOD,

00:51.551 --> 00:53.787
GLOBAL WARMING'S
GONNA KILL US ALL.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.054
Emma: A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

00:55.088 --> 00:56.723
PEARL SAID SHE THOUGHT
GLOBAL WARMING

00:56.756 --> 00:58.125
WAS A CONSPIRACY.

00:58.158 --> 01:01.429
NEVER CAME SO CLOSE
TO PUNCHING SOMEONE OVER 80.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.596
Sara: WELL, I'M GLAD

01:02.630 --> 01:04.063
YOU'VE JOINED
A CLUB AT SCHOOL.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.198
Sara: I GUESS WE HAVE
YOUR NEW FRIEND

01:05.231 --> 01:06.433
TO THANK FOR THAT.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.668
WHEN ARE WE GONNA FINALLY
MEET GREER, ANYWAY?

01:08.701 --> 01:10.137
HEY, WOULD SHE LIKE
TO JOIN US FOR DINNER
TONIGHT?

01:10.170 --> 01:11.739
UH, MAYBE.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.174
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE
YOUR OTHER FRIENDS, TOO.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.409
BY OTHER FRIENDS
YOU MEAN FORD.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.745
WHO IS LOVELY,
IT'S JUST--

01:17.777 --> 01:19.579
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
THIS GIRL IS GIVING YOU

01:19.612 --> 01:20.814
A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.082
LIKE, REALLY ENCOURAGING
YOU TO TRY NEW THINGS.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.652
( chokes )

01:24.685 --> 01:25.652
Sara: HEY, YOU'RE
JUST IN TIME.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.653
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE YOUR EGGS?

01:26.686 --> 01:28.688
UH, FROZEN, PERHAPS?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.290
Sara: MOM!

01:30.323 --> 01:31.625
April: UH, ACTUALLY,
THEY SAID I SHOULDN'T EAT

01:31.658 --> 01:33.493
TILL AFTER THE PROCEDURE,
'CAUSE OF THE ANESTHESIA.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.162
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT
YOUR "EGGS-TRACTION" TODAY?

01:36.197 --> 01:37.264
BRENNA...

01:37.298 --> 01:38.698
MOM, IT'S FINE.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.099
WE'VE GOTTA HAVE
SOME FUN WITH THIS.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.668
I ONLY HAVE TWO DAYS
UNTIL I START CHEMO.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.305
SO I WANNA JUST TRY
AND LIVE NORMALLY.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.441
GRANTED, GETTING
MY EGGS HARVESTED

01:47.474 --> 01:48.609
AT 8:00 AM
IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.277
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I, UM...

01:50.311 --> 01:52.646
I WANT TO SPEND
THESE LAST 48 HOURS

01:52.680 --> 01:54.114
JUST BEING ME.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.182
NOT CANCER ME,
JUST REGULAR ME, OKAY?

01:57.317 --> 01:59.286
OKAY, I THINK WE
CAN ALL HANDLE THAT.

01:59.319 --> 02:00.521
( sighs )

02:00.554 --> 02:02.322
JUST... TRY LOOKING

02:02.355 --> 02:03.790
ON THE SUNNY SIDE
OF ALL THIS.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.358
( groans )

02:12.866 --> 02:14.367
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT HAVING

02:14.401 --> 02:15.802
A LITTLE PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.604
YOUR LAST NIGHT
BEFORE CHEMO,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.706
COULD BE NICE TO BE
AROUND FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.740
I'D TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.443
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
LET'S DO IT.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.382
( sighs )
WHY HAVEN'T
THEY CALLED ME YET?

02:28.414 --> 02:30.783
I WISH YOU'D STARTED
YOUR SICK LEAVE NOW,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.552
INSTEAD OF WORKING
UP UNTIL THE SECOND

02:32.586 --> 02:33.853
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.155
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
THE GOVERNOR'S DEBATE

02:35.188 --> 02:37.490
IS TONIGHT AND I
HAVE TO COVER IT,

02:37.525 --> 02:39.759
ASSUMING THEY EVER GET
THESE EGGS OUT OF ME.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.632
YOUR EGGS CLEARLY
TAKE AFTER YOU.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.233
( laughs )
HERE COMES
THE LABOR STORY.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.802
I WAS NINE DAYS
PAST MY DUE DATE,

02:49.836 --> 02:52.772
DR. LEVIN WAS
PRESSURING ME TO INDUCE.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.175
AND THEN RIGHT THERE,
IN HIS OFFICE,

02:55.209 --> 02:56.276
- MY WATER BROKE.
- YOUR WATER BROKE.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.947
I LOVED BEING
PREGNANT WITH YOU.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.450
I WASN'T EVEN ANXIOUS
FOR THAT PART TO BE OVER WITH--

03:04.485 --> 03:06.753
KNOWING THAT YOU WERE
WITH ME EVERY MINUTE,

03:06.787 --> 03:09.856
AND I COULD PROTECT YOU.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.560
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN AMAZING GRANDMA.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.828
SOMEDAY, JUST GIVE ME
A COUPLE MORE YEARS.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.829
AT LEAST FIVE.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.931
( laughing )

03:17.931 --> 03:19.567
Receptionist:
APRIL CARVER?

03:30.243 --> 03:33.581
- ( theme music playing )
- ♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

03:33.614 --> 03:36.417
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

03:36.449 --> 03:41.354
♪ JUST RIGHT ♪

03:41.388 --> 03:46.326

03:46.360 --> 03:48.361

03:48.395 --> 03:49.862
♪ WE WON'T STOP. ♪

03:50.997 --> 03:52.299
Brenna: THERE WAS CRAZY

03:52.332 --> 03:54.634
TURBULENCE ON THE FLIGHT BACK.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.235
THERE WERE EVEN
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE CRYING.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.503
( laughs )

03:57.538 --> 03:59.840
SOUNDS LIKE THE TRIP
WAS A DISASTER ALL AROUND.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.375
WELL, THIS
WILL CHEER YOU UP.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.811
I GOT US TICKETS
TO THIS AWESOME CONCERT
NEXT WEEK.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.312
IT'S THESE GUYS WHO DO
ALL THE INSTRUMENT SOUNDS

04:05.346 --> 04:06.479
WITH THEIR MOUTHS--
AND BEFORE YOU SAY,

04:06.513 --> 04:07.681
"HOSTAGE SITUATION,"
I'VE SEEN THEM,

04:07.715 --> 04:08.848
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY RAD.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.584
I DON'T KNOW, APRIL'S
GOING TO BE

04:10.617 --> 04:11.585
IN THE HOSPITAL THEN.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.621
OH, MAN.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.021
APRIL'S CANCER IS
REALLY GETTING IN THE WAY

04:15.254 --> 04:17.024
OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.725
( laughs nervously )

04:18.759 --> 04:21.295
SORRY, THAT WAS--

04:21.327 --> 04:22.730
THAT WAS A REALLY STUPID
THING TO SAY.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.298
IT'S FINE.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.865
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
CAN I TAKE YOU OUT TONIGHT?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.769
I WAS GONNA HANG OUT
WITH GREER.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.004
WHO YOU JUST SAW ALL DAY
IN SCHOOL

04:31.038 --> 04:32.740
AND WENT TO FLORIDA WITH.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.641
IS SOMETHING UP WITH US?
YOU DIDN'T TEXT ME AT ALL

04:34.675 --> 04:35.742
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.946
OKAY, LISTEN--

04:38.978 --> 04:40.447
AND WHEN SOMEONE
STARTS WITH LISTEN,

04:40.480 --> 04:41.481
IT'S 'CAUSE THEY KNOW
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR

04:41.514 --> 04:42.882
WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT
TO SAY.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.685
WHAT DON'T I WANT
TO HEAR?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.586
ARE YOU DUMPING ME?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.423
NO! NO, I REALLY LIKE YOU.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.792
GOOD, I REALLY LIKE
YOU, TOO.

04:51.824 --> 04:56.430
BUT I WANT TO BE
TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.000
I'M SORT OF...

05:01.035 --> 05:03.637
HAVING FEELINGS
FOR SOMEONE ELSE, TOO.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.309
UH, WHO IS HE?

05:10.911 --> 05:14.314
ACTUALLY, IT'S...

05:14.348 --> 05:15.348
GREER.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.619
UH... GIRL GREER?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.091
WOW.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.428
SO WAIT, ARE YOU
WITH ME AS LIKE A COVER?

05:28.461 --> 05:29.896
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE A FULL-ON LESBIAN?

05:29.930 --> 05:33.100
NO. NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I AM.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.935
AND I'M NOT EVEN
INTO LABELS, ANYWAY.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.637
YOU KNOW THAT,
AND SO DOES GREER.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.105
HAVE YOU LIKE...

05:39.338 --> 05:40.641
HAVE YOU DONE
STUFF WITH HER?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.375
- KIERAN...
- HAVE YOU GONE FURTHER
WITH HER THAN ME?

05:42.408 --> 05:45.978
NO, AND IT'S NOT
LIKE A CONTEST.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.581
I REALLY LIKE YOU BOTH.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.951
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT IS THERE ANY WORLD

05:51.985 --> 05:56.523
THAT YOU WOULD BE COOL
WITH ME DATING BOTH OF YOU?

05:59.425 --> 06:01.795
I MEAN...

06:01.829 --> 06:03.697
YEAH, I CAN TRY.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.000
IF I CAN WATCH SOMETIME.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.535
( laughing )
SHUT UP.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.776
YOU CAN ALWAYS
STAY HOME.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.944
I MEAN, YOU'VE
HAD ANESTHESIA.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.012
YOU MIGHT FEEL NAUSEATED
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.081
I DON'T WANT TO STAY HOME.
I WANT TO GO TO THE DEBATE.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.716
IS IT REALLY
ABOUT THE DEBATE?

06:22.750 --> 06:23.817
OR IS IT ABOUT
SEEING LEO?

06:24.817 --> 06:25.819
( sighs )

06:27.521 --> 06:28.855
I MEAN, CAN'T
IT BE BOTH?

06:30.624 --> 06:31.625
IT'S WEIRD.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.060
HE HASN'T SHOWN UP
TO THE SUPPORT GROUP

06:33.093 --> 06:35.095
AND HE'S BEEN
IGNORING MY TEXTS.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.497
- WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ONCE SINCE--
- YOU HOOKED UP.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.800
OH, WHICH I STILL
FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.168
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT DOMINIC.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.636
MY GOD, STOP IT.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.004
YOU GUYS ARE
ON A BREAK.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.738
YEAH, AND IT ONLY TOOK
ME 48 HOURS

06:45.773 --> 06:47.875
TO HOOK UP WITH
SOMEONE ELSE.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.442
KIND OF A CLICHE,
BY THE WAY.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.812
YOU KNOW, HAVING SEX
AFTER A FUNERAL.

06:52.846 --> 06:53.880
EVEN A FAKE ONE.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.915
( groans )

06:56.949 --> 06:59.485
YOU'RE OKAY?

06:59.519 --> 07:00.620
DO YOU NEED THIS?

07:00.653 --> 07:01.922
NO, I'LL BE FINE.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.458
THIS JUST SUCKS,

07:04.490 --> 07:05.759
IT'S LIKE I HAVE
MORNING SICKNESS

07:05.793 --> 07:08.762
WITHOUT EVEN
BEING PREGNANT.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.062
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE BEST SHAPE TO BE IN

07:10.096 --> 07:11.764
TO SEE LEO.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.867
I HAVE TO GET THIS THING
WITH HIM RESOLVED BEFORE I GO

07:13.901 --> 07:16.470
INTO A CHEMO PRISON
FOR A MONTH.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.004
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET
ME COME WITH YOU?

07:19.473 --> 07:20.807
( stammering )
PRETEND I'M
YOUR ASSISTANT,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.942
AND YOUR ASSISTANT'S JOB
IS TO CARRY A BARF BAG.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.045
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
A PRETTY CRAPPY BOSS.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.779
I'VE HAD WORSE.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.584
( breathes deeply )

07:35.588 --> 07:36.590
SHE'S WITH ME.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.863
AND THERE HE IS.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.733
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.471
MAYBE HE DIDN'T SEE YOU.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.507
HE SAW ME.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.077
( exhales deeply )

07:58.110 --> 08:00.547
HEY, LOOK, I'M GOING TO GO
AND GET YOU A WATER, OKAY?

08:00.581 --> 08:01.648
NO. NO, I'M OKAY.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.716
GO IN AND WATCH
THE DEBATE.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.750
I HAVE TO CHECK IN
AND GET TO WORK.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.819
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
WAS ME STAYING WITH YOU.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.021
I KNOW, BUT IT'S
GONNA LOOK WEIRD

08:08.055 --> 08:09.589
IF YOU COME IN WITH ME,
LIKE SOMETHING'S WRONG.

08:09.622 --> 08:10.624
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.226
PLEASE, JUST GO.
I'LL FIND YOU AFTER.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.629
AND I PLAY SECOND SINGLES.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.031
KAITLIN, WHO PLAYS
FIRST SINGLES,

08:18.064 --> 08:19.499
SHE'S GRADUATING.
SO I'M HOPING

08:19.533 --> 08:21.535
TO GET BUMPED UP
NEXT YEAR.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.735
YOU KNOW WHO'S
NOT BAD AT TENNIS...

08:22.769 --> 08:24.637
I LEARNED THAT
THE HARD WAY.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.839
( laughing )

08:26.874 --> 08:28.641
MOM, AREN'T YOU
STAYING FOR DINNER?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.110
WE ORDERED CHINESE.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.111
( stammers )
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SHOPPING
TO DO WITH GERTIE,

08:32.144 --> 08:33.647
FOR APRIL'S PARTY.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.115
NO, I CAN DO THAT
OR I CAN DRIVE YOU.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.517
I'VE GOT IT,
I'VE GOT IT.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.889
THAT WAS WEIRD.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.990
I'D SAY THAT WAS
HER REGULAR WEIRD.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.960
SO, GREER...

08:46.994 --> 08:50.163
CLASS PRESIDENT,
TENNIS CAPTAIN,
ECO CLUB PRESIDENT,

08:50.197 --> 08:51.163
HOW DO YOU
MANAGE EVERYTHING?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.299
I HAVE A TWIN.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.102
( chuckles )
AND A SENSE OF HUMOR.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.638
- I LIKE THIS ONE, BRENNA.
- ( doorbell rings )

08:57.671 --> 08:58.804
I THINK THAT'S
THE FOOD.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.106
MOM, CAN I
HAVE YOUR CARD?

09:00.139 --> 09:02.142
I CAN COVER IT.
MY PARENTS LEFT ME MONEY

09:02.174 --> 09:03.543
FOR MEALS WHEN THEY'RE
OUT OF TOWN.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.211
NO, YOU ARE NOT PAYING
FOR FOOD IN MY HOUSE.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.647
BUT THANK YOU
FOR OFFERING.

09:06.679 --> 09:09.048
HERE YOU GO.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.618
HOW LONG ARE
YOUR PARENTS GONE FOR?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.587
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS
OF MY LIFE SO FAR.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.655
AW...

09:15.688 --> 09:17.591
BUT JUST A COUPLE DAYS
THIS TIME.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.926
WELL, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
WELCOME TO SPEND

09:18.958 --> 09:19.993
THE NIGHT HERE IF YOU WANT.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.128
THANKS.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.567
HOLA.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.036
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.836
THE SAME THING I'M
DOING HERE EVERY
OTHER TIME I COME OVER--

09:30.870 --> 09:33.673
I'M RAIDING YOUR FRIDGE
AND WATCHING BAD TV WITH YOU.

09:33.706 --> 09:34.841
IS THAT COOL?

09:34.875 --> 09:38.077
UH, YEAH.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.613
GREER'S HERE.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.215
IS THERE AN EMERGENCY
ECO CLUB MEETING?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.150
ARE THE DOLPHINS OKAY?

09:44.183 --> 09:46.286
NO, WE'RE JUST
HANGING OUT.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.792
OKAY, UM...
I DON'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.628
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
COME IN.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.197
MY UNCLE'S COMING OVER,
WE JUST ORDERED CHINESE.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.032
AND YOU SHOULD
HANG OUT WITH GREER,

09:59.066 --> 10:02.101
I THINK YOU GUYS
MIGHT ACTUALLY
LIKE EACH OTHER.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.136
( frequent chatter )

10:08.808 --> 10:10.210
Bruce Hendrie:
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:10.243 --> 10:11.878
Can I have
your attention, please?

10:13.312 --> 10:14.313
YOU'RE HERE.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.982
April:
I SAID I WOULD BE.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.384
YOU WEREN'T
IN THE OFFICE TODAY.

10:17.616 --> 10:18.384
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU STARTED

10:18.618 --> 10:19.753
YOUR LEAVE
OF ABSENCE EARLY.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.788
NOPE.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.123
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU AGAIN?

10:23.155 --> 10:25.158
NOTHING YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.826
OH, I WASN'T
GONNA WORRY.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.028
Reporter:
I understand that you debated

10:28.061 --> 10:29.363
in college like your father.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.399
Leo:
Yes, I did.

10:32.631 --> 10:33.933
AS MY MOM CAN ATTEST,

10:33.966 --> 10:35.134
BRUCE AND I HAD

10:35.168 --> 10:38.904
A FEW PRETTY INTENSE, VERBAL
JOUSTING MATCHES.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.640
THANKSGIVING 2011
COMES TO MIND,

10:41.674 --> 10:42.908
TURKEY FEATHERS FLEW.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.411
Reporter:
What was the topic of debate?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.178
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THAT THE--

10:46.212 --> 10:49.048
( speaking gibberish )

10:54.221 --> 10:56.756
( Leo continues
speaking gibberish )

11:03.263 --> 11:04.230
EXCUSE ME?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.765
LEO...

11:09.302 --> 11:11.138
( phones ringing )

11:14.173 --> 11:17.344
( emergency vehicle sirens )

11:17.744 --> 11:20.846
OH, NO. APRIL.
EXCUSE ME.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.682
CAN YOU MOVE BACK, PLEASE?

11:22.716 --> 11:23.884
- EXCUSE ME.
- April: BETH!

11:23.917 --> 11:26.452
OH, MY GOD, APRIL!

11:26.686 --> 11:28.788
I HEARD THIS COMMOTION
AND I THOUGHT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO YOU.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.791
NO, NO, I'M FINE,
IT'S LEO.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.725
HE HAD LIKE,
A STROKE OR SOMETHING.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.826
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS,
BUT I NEED TO--

11:33.860 --> 11:35.128
PLEASE, EVERYBODY.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.129
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.163
STAND BACK.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.432
Sanya:
GIVE THEM ROOM.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.036
- MOM, I'M FINE.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.738
WE ARE TAKING YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.907
BRUCE...

11:48.908 --> 11:50.876
WE CAN'T LEAVE
BEFORE THE DEBATE.
LISTEN...

11:57.116 --> 11:58.317
DON'T LET HIM LEAVE.

12:01.822 --> 12:02.822
NO, LOOK--
PLEASE, I DON'T NEED--

12:02.855 --> 12:04.457
I CAN WALK
ON MY OWN, ALL RIGHT.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.768
I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
COUNTRIES

12:14.801 --> 12:15.869
I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

12:15.902 --> 12:16.903
WELL, I DON'T MEET
VERY MANY PEOPLE

12:16.937 --> 12:18.171
WHO HAVE BEEN
TO NICARAGUA.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.407
YOU TWO PROBABLY ACTUALLY
HAVE A LOT OF OVERLAP.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.807
YOU WON'T MEET
MANY PEOPLE

12:21.841 --> 12:23.509
MORE WELL-TRAVELED
THAN GEORGE.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.177
( chuckles )

12:26.480 --> 12:27.880
DID YOU ZIP-LINE
WHILE YOU WERE THERE?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.081
OH, NO, NO, NO.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.116
BUT DID YOU HIKE

12:30.149 --> 12:31.350
MOMBACHO VOLCANO?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.153
MY DAD AND I DID.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.355
WELL, BRENNA'S DAD
AND I DID.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.889
WE'RE DOING GUATEMALA
IN AUGUST.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.825
MAYBE YOU CAN
COME WITH US, BREN.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.927
BRENNA AND I DON'T
REALLY DO PLACES

12:40.961 --> 12:43.196
WHERE THE MAIN TOURIST
ATTRACTION IS POOR PEOPLE.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.899
I DON'T KNOW, I...

12:46.932 --> 12:49.802
I THINK THERE'S A LOT
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.037
I THINK IT WOULD BE
COOL TO SEE

12:51.071 --> 12:52.838
SUCH A DIFFERENT CULTURE.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.006
George:
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
MAYBE BRENNA'S GOT

12:54.039 --> 12:55.307
THE CARVER WANDERLUST.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.809
OH, GOD HELP ME.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.178
( all laugh )

13:00.913 --> 13:01.947
I'M GONNA CLEAN UP.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.216
Sara:
THANK YOU, FORD.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.918
- I CAN HELP, TOO.
- Ford:
I GOT IT.

13:04.951 --> 13:05.985
I KNOW WHERE
EVERYTHING GOES.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.995
Woman:
As someone who knows
firsthand the value

13:16.028 --> 13:19.265
OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.936
I WILL MAKE IT MY PRIORITY
WHEN I AM ELECTED GOVERNOR.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.004
MR. HENDRIE, TWO MINUTES.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.274
Thank you.
My opponent didn't use

13:28.307 --> 13:30.911
THE WORD ELITIST
IN DESCRIBING ME,

13:30.943 --> 13:32.979
ALTHOUGH IT WAS
CLEARLY IMPLIED.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.048
AND TO THAT I SAY,
I STRONGLY BELIEVE

13:36.081 --> 13:38.918
THAT ALL CHILDREN...

13:43.355 --> 13:45.892
All children...

13:49.261 --> 13:53.567
I'M SORRY.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.001
THERE'S ONLY ONE CHILD
THAT MATTERS TO ME NOW.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.910
AND I NEED TO BE THERE
FOR HIM, RIGHT NOW.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.947
( crowd murmuring )

14:09.416 --> 14:10.417
I'M SORRY.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.195
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME
FOREVER, SANYA.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.197
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
AT SOME POINT.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.933
( crying )

14:34.975 --> 14:37.476
WERE YOU
AND LEO HENDRIE CLOSE?

14:37.509 --> 14:39.946
NO. I'VE MET LEO,
BUT...

14:39.980 --> 14:41.981
THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M UPSET.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.221
MY BEST FRIEND
IS SICK, TOO.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.658
( Beth sobbing )

14:55.095 --> 14:56.196
THANK YOU.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.198
IT'S LEUKEMIA.

15:02.101 --> 15:05.371
AND YOU KNOW,
BEFORE SHE GOT SICK,

15:05.404 --> 15:09.442
WHEN I'D SEE HER NAME
ON CALLER ID, I'D BE EXCITED.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.477
YOU KNOW, I'D BE LIKE
WHAT BAR ARE WE HITTING?

15:11.510 --> 15:13.480
OR WHAT HAPPENED WITH
THAT GUY THAT SHE WAS
CRUSHING ON?

15:13.513 --> 15:17.149
AND NOW I SEE IT,
AND...

15:19.019 --> 15:21.053
I'M--

15:21.086 --> 15:25.958
I JUST THINK LIKE,
OH, GOD, WHAT'S WRONG NOW?
YOU KNOW?

15:28.995 --> 15:31.530
I'M JUST-- I'M SCARED
ALL OF THE TIME.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.932
AND OF COURSE, I MEAN,
I CAN'T TELL HER
ANY OF THAT.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.369
'CAUSE I JUST--
I JUST WANT HER
TO GET BETTER.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.104
( sighs heavily )

15:39.272 --> 15:41.408
AND SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO START CHEMO THIS WEEK.

15:44.110 --> 15:48.114
( sobbing heavily )

15:48.148 --> 15:50.549
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
IF I LOST HER.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.623
I'M... I'M SORRY.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.697
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHOEVER WROTE THAT BOOK

16:03.730 --> 16:06.399
"BE YOUR OWN BEST FRIEND,"

16:06.432 --> 16:08.067
THEY HAD A POINT.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.014
APRIL, HEY!

16:21.047 --> 16:22.414
( sighs )
HEY.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.721
HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.668
ABOUT TIME...

16:44.403 --> 16:48.073
OH, YOU'RE NOT
THE RADIOLOGIST.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.709
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

16:49.743 --> 16:51.144
POPULAR.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.779
A VIDEO OF MY
LITTLE GIBBERISH EPISODE

16:54.013 --> 16:56.515
IS TRENDING ON TWITTER,
HASHTAG DEATH'S DOORSTEP.

16:56.548 --> 16:57.517
SO THAT'S A LOT
OF FUN.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.753
LEO...

16:59.786 --> 17:02.389
PLEASE HAVE THE SURGERY.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.324
AND HERE WE GO.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.358
I'M SORRY, BUT YOUR
WHOLE ARGUMENT

17:06.393 --> 17:07.794
ABOUT HOW LIFE IS BETTER
WITHOUT IT,

17:08.027 --> 17:10.063
HOW IS THAT TRUE
AFTER TONIGHT?

17:10.096 --> 17:11.196
IT DOESN'T HOLD UP.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.098
HOW IS THIS YOUR BUSINESS?

17:13.133 --> 17:16.368
BECAUSE I'M YOUR FRIEND

17:16.403 --> 17:18.704
AND WE SLEPT TOGETHER.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.240
OH, SO BECAUSE
WE HOOKED UP,

17:21.273 --> 17:22.442
YOU GET A VOTE?

17:25.111 --> 17:28.080
I MADE THIS DECISION
LONG BEFORE YOU.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.215
AND I'M SORRY, BUT HONESTLY,
I DON'T NEED YOU IN MY LIFE

17:30.250 --> 17:32.551
IF YOU'RE ON A MISSION
TO MAKE ME RETHINK THAT.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.726
FINE.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.228
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE THE OPERATION,

17:42.261 --> 17:44.096
THEN THIS IS IT.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.498
I CAN'T SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:47.133 --> 17:50.702
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO GO
FIGHT FOR MY LIFE,

17:50.737 --> 17:53.306
AND I CAN'T BE AROUND
SOMEONE WHO HAS A CHANCE
TO DO THAT

17:53.338 --> 17:54.740
AND WON'T EVEN TRY.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.279
AND YET, WHO'S CHASING WHO
RIGHT NOW?

18:05.484 --> 18:07.353
GOODBYE, LEO.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.627
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.667
AND I'LL HAVE
A NICE DEATH.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.510
( door closes )

18:44.156 --> 18:46.692
WELL, LOOK WHO'S
FASHIONABLY EARLY.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.528
I WAS VISITING
A FRIEND.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.698
WELL, WHILE I HAVE YOU,
CAN I GIVE YOU A PREVIEW

18:51.730 --> 18:53.766
OF WHERE YOU'LL BE
SPENDING THE NEXT MONTH?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.367
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

18:55.401 --> 18:57.302
SURE.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.704
YOU A.M.L. FOLKS
REALLY GET THE SHORT END

18:58.738 --> 19:00.373
OF THE STICK WHEN IT
COMES TO CHEMO--

19:00.405 --> 19:01.907
HAVING TO BE STUCK HERE
FOR SO LONG.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.243
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
THE MORE WE CAN MONITOR YOU,

19:04.277 --> 19:06.211
THE MORE WE CAN
PROTECT YOU.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.380
HAVE YOU STARTED
TO PACK?

19:07.413 --> 19:08.615
NOT YET.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.816
I HAVE PATIENTS
SHOWING UP WITH

19:09.848 --> 19:11.183
TWO OR THREE
TRUNKS WORTH.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.219
I MEAN, OF COURSE WE HAVE
OUR STANDARD ISSUE

19:13.252 --> 19:15.355
UGLY-ASS HOSPITAL GOWNS,
BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL FEEL

19:15.387 --> 19:17.624
MORE LIKE YOURSELF
IN YOUR OWN P.J.s.

19:17.656 --> 19:22.161
MAYBE SOME DECORATIONS,
SOMETHING TO MAKE THE ROOM
MORE PERSONAL.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.596
AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THIS,

19:24.631 --> 19:27.666
SOME OF THE PATIENTS
LIKE TO SHAVE THEIR HEADS
BEFOREHAND.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.336
JUST TO BEAT THE CHEMO
TO THE PUNCH.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.604
HERE WE ARE.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.942
IF IT'S NOT THIS ROOM,
IT'LL BE ONE JUST LIKE IT.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.881
ALL OF OUR ACCOMMODATIONS
ARE EQUALLY LUXURIOUS.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.653
April:
ONE MONTH, HUH?

19:57.931 --> 19:59.932
( music playing, muffled )

20:03.836 --> 20:05.637
GIRLS, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY GOODNIGHT--

20:05.672 --> 20:07.539
OH!

20:12.377 --> 20:13.378
( sighs )

20:14.948 --> 20:15.981
( music stops )

20:21.354 --> 20:23.388
Brenna:
YEAH, COME IN.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.827
GREER...

20:28.861 --> 20:31.897
UM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SLEEP DOWNSTAIRS
ON THE COUCH.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.232
OKAY.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.669
THERE'S A THROW DOWN THERE,
A BLUE, UM...

20:36.702 --> 20:38.770
I THINK IT SHOULD
BE WARM ENOUGH, IT'S
LIKE A WOOL BLEND.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.239
- YOU'RE NOT ALLERGIC,
ARE YOU?
- NO.

20:40.272 --> 20:41.941
Greer:
GOODNIGHT, DR. CARVER.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.609
- NIGHT.
- NIGHT, BREN.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.017
I WANT TO CHOOSE
MY WORDS CAREFULLY--

20:51.250 --> 20:54.854
PLEASE... DON'T
MAKE THIS A THING.

20:54.886 --> 20:59.258
I WON'T, BUT WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THIS.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.636
SO...

21:10.670 --> 21:14.773
HAVE YOU ALWAYS HAD
FEELINGS FOR GIRLS?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.276
I DON'T KNOW.

21:17.309 --> 21:21.780
I NEVER HAVE BEFORE.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.583
AND DOES THIS MEAN
THAT YOU'VE SPLIT UP

21:23.615 --> 21:26.551
WITH KIERAN?

21:26.586 --> 21:29.989
NO.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.326
OH, SO YOU'RE
SEEING THEM BOTH?

21:38.064 --> 21:41.800
HONEY, JUST REMEMBER
HEARTS ARE TENDER
AT YOUR AGE,

21:41.834 --> 21:45.003
AT ANY AGE REALLY.

21:45.038 --> 21:46.873
THEY BRUISE EASILY.

21:49.008 --> 21:52.010
HMM... OKAY.

22:06.358 --> 22:07.460
( groans )

22:11.730 --> 22:13.031
MOM, YOU OKAY?

22:13.066 --> 22:15.367
YOU HAVE A WEIRD LOOK
ON YOUR FACE.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.703
IT'S JUST...

22:17.737 --> 22:19.905
THERE'S A...

22:19.939 --> 22:21.973
ANOTHER TIME.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.576
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

22:24.609 --> 22:26.078
OH, ANOTHER TIME.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.913
I HAVE LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND
THINGS TO DO

22:27.946 --> 22:29.414
TO GET READY
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.550
I JUST HOPE WORK TOMORROW
IS UNEVENTFUL.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.453
I WOULD HATE FOR A BIG STORY
TO BREAK ON MY LAST DAY.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.930
MORNING, MAL.
HOW'S IT GOING?

22:45.832 --> 22:47.032
HERE.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.111
YOU GO AHEAD.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.711
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.013
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD
OF ALL OF US.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.017
UH... THANKS.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.156
HEY, APRIL.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.509
I'M COVERING THE POLITICAL
RAMIFICATIONS OF HENDRIE
DROPPING OUT,

23:30.542 --> 23:32.577
YOU DO THE...

23:32.612 --> 23:36.414
TOUCHY-FEELY BIT
FOR SECTION "B,"
THE FAMILY STUFF.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.519
HOPEFULLY YOU CAN FINISH
BEFORE YOUR VACATION.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.520
I REALLY WISH I HAD
HAD MORE NOTICE

23:41.554 --> 23:43.990
ABOUT YOU TAKING OFF,
I COULD HAVE STARTED
TRAINING SOMEONE.

23:44.022 --> 23:47.192
NOT THAT WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING IS ROCKET SCIENCE.

23:47.425 --> 23:51.430
RAQUEL, YOU KNOW
I'M SICK, RIGHT?

23:51.463 --> 23:54.066
I MEAN, THAT...

23:54.099 --> 23:57.435
I HAVE CANCER.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.738
YEAH.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.655
HEY, I THOUGHT I MIGHT
STEAL YOU FOR LUNCH.

24:16.689 --> 24:17.757
THEY KNOW.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.492
THEY KNOW WHAT?

24:20.526 --> 24:22.828
EVERYONE HERE KNOWS
ABOUT ME.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.534
April:
YOU THINK IT WAS DANNY,
AND HE'S JUST NOT TELLING ME?

24:28.567 --> 24:30.936
I MEAN, HE'S ALWAYS
LIKE GOING THROUGH
MY DESK.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.805
BUT I DIDN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING IN MY DESK

24:32.838 --> 24:34.006
OR ON MY COMPUTER.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.075
OH, MAYBE SOMEONE
KNOWS SOMEONE

24:36.107 --> 24:37.576
AT THE PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL.
OR SOMEONE--

24:37.609 --> 24:39.045
OKAY, STOP.
I HAVE TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

24:39.077 --> 24:40.980
WHAT?

24:41.012 --> 24:42.848
I KNOW HOW
THEY FOUND OUT.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.618
SO, YOU REMEMBER
AT THE DEBATE

24:46.652 --> 24:48.253
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE THE ONE THAT COLLAPSED,

24:48.487 --> 24:49.588
AND I WAS FREAKING OUT?

24:49.622 --> 24:50.957
YEAH.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.792
WELL, I WENT TO THE BATHROOM
AND I HAD LIKE A PANIC ATTACK.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.493
I'M SORRY.

24:55.528 --> 24:58.564
NO, I'M SORRY, BECAUSE...

24:58.597 --> 25:00.199
SEE, THERE WAS THIS GIRL
IN THE BATHROOM

25:00.232 --> 25:01.767
AND I KIND OF CRIED
ON HER SHOULDER,

25:01.800 --> 25:03.201
AND I TOLD HER
THAT MY FRIEND WAS SICK.

25:03.236 --> 25:06.972
AND I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT SHE WAS JUST
SOME RANDOM STRANGER,

25:07.006 --> 25:07.973
BUT IT TURNS OUT--

25:08.007 --> 25:09.541
WHO WAS IT?

25:09.575 --> 25:12.211
I DON'T KNOW HER NAME
BUT I JUST SAW HER
IN YOUR OFFICE.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.512
LONG, BROWN HAIR,
KIND OF EXOTIC LOOKING

25:14.547 --> 25:15.847
IN AN AMBIGUOUS WAY,
LIKE ME.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.848
RAQUEL!

25:16.883 --> 25:18.517
OH, GOD,
THAT WAS RAQUEL?

25:18.550 --> 25:19.618
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT?

25:19.652 --> 25:20.987
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO SHE WAS.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.624
SO WHAT, YOU JUST DECIDED
TO TELL A RANDOM STRANGER

25:24.656 --> 25:25.790
IN A BATHROOM ABOUT ME?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.526
AT A WORK EVENT FOR ME?

25:27.559 --> 25:29.228
YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS
A SMART IDEA?

25:29.261 --> 25:32.131
THIS WAS MY LAST DAY, BETH.
I HAD ONE MORE DAY.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.967
ONE MORE DAY AND I WAS
JUST GONNA GO AWAY,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.169
HANDLE THIS IN PRIVATE,
AND COME BACK TO WORK
IN A MONTH--

25:37.202 --> 25:39.572
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T THINK
THAT PEOPLE WERE GONNA
FIND OUT?

25:39.605 --> 25:41.307
YOU DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE
WERE GONNA ASK QUESTIONS

25:41.539 --> 25:42.575
ABOUT YOUR MEDICAL LEAVE?

25:42.607 --> 25:44.644
COME ON, APRIL,
YOU WORK WITH REPORTERS.

25:44.676 --> 25:46.578
WHO ALL SEE ME
DIFFERENTLY NOW,
THANK YOU.

25:46.612 --> 25:47.980
IS THAT THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD?

25:48.013 --> 25:50.048
THIS WAS
MY BUSINESS, OKAY?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.084
IT WAS UP TO ME
IF I TOLD PEOPLE,

25:52.117 --> 25:53.685
AND YOU JUST TOOK
THAT AWAY FROM ME.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.288
APRIL, I'M SORRY.
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE THIS OKAY?

25:56.322 --> 25:57.556
NOTHING, IT'S DONE.

25:57.589 --> 25:58.924
APRIL, PLEASE...

25:58.958 --> 26:01.559
ANYTHING-- JUST TELL
ME WHAT TO DO,

26:01.594 --> 26:02.627
I WANT TO FIX THIS.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.329
YOU KNOW WHAT, BETH?
I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT

26:04.563 --> 26:05.765
WHAT YOU NEED RIGHT NOW.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.211
( sighs )

26:20.980 --> 26:22.580
DANNY...

26:25.951 --> 26:29.788
OH, LOOK, RAQUEL'S DOING
HER MIDDAY OFFICE STRETCHES.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.022
I'M ON A DEADLINE.

26:33.326 --> 26:36.061
YEAH, SO AM I.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.979
- HEY.
- HEY.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.080
THE FACT THAT YOU
JUST STARTED
A CONVERSATION

26:55.114 --> 26:58.183
WITH ME, MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE THERE'S HOPE
FOR THE MIDDLE EAST.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.618
YEAH, TOTALLY.

27:00.653 --> 27:04.056
SO... HOW DID
YOU TURN BRENNA?

27:04.089 --> 27:07.159
( snorts )
YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT HOW GAY WORKS, RIGHT?

27:07.192 --> 27:09.996
BUT I GUESS SHE TOLD
YOU WE'RE SEEING
EACH OTHER, HUH?

27:10.028 --> 27:11.864
AND I'M REALLY GLAD
IT'S OUT THERE.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.199
AND I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW,

27:13.231 --> 27:15.034
THAT I TOTALLY RESPECT
YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH BRENNA

27:15.067 --> 27:17.269
AND I'D NEVER WANT YOU
TO FEEL LIKE THE THIRD WHEEL.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.137
ACTUALLY, I HAVE THIS GREAT GUY
I WANT TO SET YOU UP WITH,

27:19.171 --> 27:22.141
HIS NAME'S P.J.
HE'S REALLY CUTE, FOR A BOY.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.676
UM... YEAH, COOL,
MAYBE.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.979
ARE YOU COMING
TO BRENNA'S TONIGHT,

27:27.012 --> 27:28.247
FOR APRIL'S PARTY?

27:28.279 --> 27:30.281
SO YOU'RE INVITED
TO EVERYTHING NOW?

27:30.316 --> 27:33.818
I MEAN, WE'RE DATING,
THAT'S KIND OF HOW
IT WORKS.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.755
LOOK, FORD,

27:35.788 --> 27:37.088
WE CAN BE FRIENDS,

27:37.123 --> 27:38.656
I KNOW WE CAN.

27:38.691 --> 27:39.825
EVEN IF IT KILLS US.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.294
IT MIGHT.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.953
IS THAT YOUR STAPLER,
OR ARE YOU STEALING
OUR OFFICE SUPPLIES?

28:41.987 --> 28:43.923
IT'S MINE.

28:43.955 --> 28:44.957
JUST CHECKING.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.927
YOU KNOW, RAQUEL,
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON HERE

28:48.961 --> 28:53.132
WHO KNOWS I HAVE CANCER
AND DIDN'T TREAT ME
ANY DIFFERENTLY.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.301
I MEAN, YOU TREATED ME BADLY,
BUT STILL...

28:56.335 --> 28:57.802
AT LEAST IT WAS NORMAL.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.038
THAT'S WHAT I'D WANT PEOPLE
TO DO IF I WAS SICK.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.776
WAY TO MAKE
MY CANCER ABOUT YOU.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.376
WATCH, YOU'RE GONNA GET
A BOOK DEAL OUT OF THIS.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.445
AND EVERY TIME SOMEONE
HAS CANCER AND WRITES
A BOOK ABOUT IT,

29:07.480 --> 29:08.980
IT'S LIKE A BESTSELLER.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.282
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE LUCKY, PER SE.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.218
WHAT ARE THOSE
LITTLE, PINK BLOBS?

29:46.251 --> 29:48.354
THEY'RE HEARTS.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.155
- DON'T THEY LOOK
LIKE HEARTS?
- NAH, KIDNEYS.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.825
OH, NO, DON'T-- KIDN--

29:52.857 --> 29:54.393
BETH, HELP ME.

29:54.425 --> 29:55.827
- WHAT'S UP?
- I'M NOT DOING THIS RIGHT.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.529
I'VE GOT TOO MUCH STUFF.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.798
THESE ARE SO CHEESY,
SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.167
I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN KINDERGARTEN.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.469
( Brenna and Greer laugh )

30:05.538 --> 30:06.905
- ( doorbell rings )
- I'LL GET IT.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.516
- HI.
- HEY.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.417
I WANTED TO DROP SOMETHING
OFF FOR YOUR SISTER,

30:19.451 --> 30:23.855
I FELT BAD AFTER I MADE
THAT STUPID JOKE.

30:23.888 --> 30:25.857
I KNOW IT'S KIND OF LAME,
BUT...

30:29.394 --> 30:32.163
NO, IT'S GREAT.
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

30:34.599 --> 30:37.569
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
SOMETHING GOING ON.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.337
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
WOULD WANT TO COME,

30:39.371 --> 30:41.406
GREER'S HERE.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.441
OH.

30:42.473 --> 30:43.442
HER PARENTS ARE
OUT OF TOWN,

30:43.474 --> 30:45.076
SO SHE'S BEEN
STAYING OVER.

30:47.112 --> 30:49.882
I DON'T MIND SEEING GREER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SEEING HER.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.220
OH, THAT'S CUTE.
GREAT.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.887
- GEORGE, GEORGE.
- WHAT?

30:55.921 --> 30:57.556
OH, NO, PLEASE.
OKAY.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.557
( laughing )
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

30:59.592 --> 31:00.593
OH, APRIL!

31:00.625 --> 31:02.894
( all cheering )

31:02.928 --> 31:04.028
Sara:
THERE SHE IS.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.365
OH, THANKS, YOU GUYS.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.902
SWEETHEART, I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU HAVE A LOT TO DO TONIGHT

31:09.934 --> 31:12.238
TO GET READY FOR TOMORROW,
BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.873
ALLOW ME TO DIRECT
YOUR ATTENTION TO EXHIBIT A,

31:14.906 --> 31:18.109
HOSPITAL WARDROBE, CUSTOM MADE
BY BETH AND HER MINIONS.

31:18.143 --> 31:19.111
- THAT WOULD BE US.
- OO-OH...

31:19.144 --> 31:20.144
AND MY GOAL WAS
TO MAKE YOU

31:20.179 --> 31:21.614
THE HOTTEST GIRL
IN THE CANCER WARD.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.348
GERMFREE,
NONPERISHABLE FLOWERS

31:23.382 --> 31:24.650
TO MAKE YOUR ROOM PRETTY.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.018
AND A PHOTO ALBUM

31:26.050 --> 31:27.653
OF ALL OF US TO KEEP
IN YOUR ROOM.

31:28.988 --> 31:29.954
( laughs )

31:29.989 --> 31:31.656
- WHAT IS THAT?
- AND BRENNA...

31:31.890 --> 31:35.961
I PACKED YOUR BAG.
I PUT BOGGLE IN IT,

31:35.994 --> 31:37.563
SOME FUZZY SLIPPERS,

31:37.596 --> 31:38.896
AND...

31:40.231 --> 31:41.333
FOR ANNOYING NURSES.

31:41.366 --> 31:46.070
( sighs )
THANK YOU, GUYS.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.640
SEE, YOU'RE ALL SET.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.907
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT TONIGHT IS HAVING FUN.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.278
April:
IS THAT-- IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE DOING HERE?

31:52.310 --> 31:53.979
( Brenna and Greer giggle )

31:54.012 --> 31:55.480
THIS WEIRD FOR YOU?

31:57.215 --> 31:58.584
I SAID I WAS COOL WITH THIS,
BUT I DON'T KNOW,

31:58.616 --> 32:00.618
MAYBE I'M NOT.

32:00.653 --> 32:01.686
COME WITH ME.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.670
CAN I JUST SAY ONE MORE TIME,
I AM SO, SO SORRY ABOUT--

32:17.702 --> 32:20.005
NO, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.674
I THINK YOU DID
ME A FAVOR.

32:22.708 --> 32:23.675
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.644
NO, I'M NOT
JUST SAYING IT.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.650
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME
WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT.

32:31.683 --> 32:36.622
AND BEING SICK, I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE, LET'S ME SEE THINGS

32:36.654 --> 32:39.724
IN A WAY THAT
MOST PEOPLE CAN'T.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.960
THAT'S WHAT I ENDED UP
WRITING MY ARTICLE ABOUT,

32:41.993 --> 32:46.498
HOW THIS IS KIND OF,
WEIRDLY, A GIFT.

32:46.531 --> 32:49.567
A GIFT I WOULD TOTALLY RETURN
FOR A FULL REFUND IN TWO SECONDS

32:49.601 --> 32:52.171
IF I COULD, BUT I CAN'T.

32:52.203 --> 32:54.373
SO, I GOTTA OWN IT.

32:54.405 --> 32:56.607
ATTAGIRL.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.545
I JUST WISH I COULD
GET A HOLD OF DOMINIC.

32:59.577 --> 33:01.046
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CALL HIM ALL DAY,

33:01.079 --> 33:02.748
I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY
FROM THE PAPER TO TELL HIM,

33:02.980 --> 33:05.084
OR FOR HIM TO LIKE
READ ABOUT IT FIRST.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.621
HEY, THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I WANT TO DO FOR YOU TONIGHT.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.191
COME ON.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.037
WHAT THE HELL?!

33:25.069 --> 33:27.038
WHAT? I THOUGHT
WE WEREN'T EXCLUSIVE.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.374
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU
NEED HIM FOR?

33:28.406 --> 33:30.209
OR ME? YOU HAVE GREER,
SHE'S YOUR LOVER

33:30.241 --> 33:31.777
AND YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

33:32.009 --> 33:35.447
I'M NOT LIKE REPLACING
YOU WITH GREER.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.083
WHATEVER, YOU DIDN'T
EVEN TELL ME YOU GUYS
WERE HOOKING UP.

33:38.116 --> 33:39.117
I HAD TO FRIGGIN' GUESS.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.086
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
YOU WOULD REACT.

33:41.119 --> 33:46.090
YEAH, WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO BE ALL, "HEY, LOOK AT ME,
I'M BI," AWESOME.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.460
BUT DUDE, SHE'S SO LAME
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.328
OH, AND HOOKING UP WITH
OTHER PEOPLE'S BOYFRIENDS,

33:50.362 --> 33:51.329
THAT'S NOT LAME?

33:51.363 --> 33:52.631
BOYFRIEND?

33:52.663 --> 33:53.699
ISN'T THAT A LABEL?

33:53.731 --> 33:56.634
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS, CLEARLY.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.569
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
NEED THIS FROM SOMEONE

33:58.604 --> 34:00.806
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MY BEST FRIEND.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.075
MAYBE I'M NOT SO INTO
THAT LABEL ANYMORE.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.646
I THOUGHT I CAN DEAL WITH THIS,
I'M SORRY.

34:08.679 --> 34:12.050
I JUST... I CAN'T.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.519
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ONE OF THE PEOPLE

34:14.552 --> 34:17.155
THAT YOU'RE SEEING,
I WANT TO BE THE PERSON.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.391
AND MAYBE SHE'S COOL
WITH YOU DATING

34:19.425 --> 34:20.726
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
AT ONCE, YOU KNOW.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.059
BUT...

34:22.094 --> 34:23.327
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

34:23.362 --> 34:24.530
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.331
BRENNA WAS ABOUT TO TELL ME
WHICH ONE OF US

34:26.364 --> 34:27.398
SHE WANTS TO BE WITH.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.842
GREER'S NEVER ASKED ME TO PICK.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.188
I MEAN, I REALLY LIKE YOU,

34:49.221 --> 34:51.824
BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN
KEEP DOING THIS

34:51.856 --> 34:54.760
UNLESS IT'S FOR REAL.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.710
I'M SORRY.

35:39.338 --> 35:40.304
Beth:
THREE,

35:40.338 --> 35:42.507
TWO, ONE.

35:44.342 --> 35:45.677
OH, MY GOD.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.411
SEE? WHAT'D I TELL YOU,

35:47.445 --> 35:50.715
I KNEW YOU'D STILL
BE GORGEOUS BALD.

35:50.748 --> 35:53.150
WOW.

35:53.184 --> 35:54.686
LOOK AT THAT.

35:54.719 --> 35:57.222
HOW...

35:57.255 --> 36:00.492
I MEAN, IT'S NOT...
HORRIBLE, RIGHT?

36:00.525 --> 36:03.195
RIGHT. NOW YOU KNOW.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.273
SEE, WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.211
( sighs )

36:24.650 --> 36:26.518
- GOODNIGHT.
- NO, NO, HANG ON.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.519
- WHAT?
- MY GIFT FOR YOU.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.489
AND I ADDED A LITTLE
EXTRA SOMETHING

36:31.523 --> 36:32.757
TO HELP YOU
WITH THE NAUSEA.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.565
DID YOU MAKE ME
POT BROWNIES?

36:39.597 --> 36:41.900
UM, I PLEAD THE FIFTH.

36:41.934 --> 36:44.869
BUT WHERE DID YOU
GET THE...

36:44.902 --> 36:47.338
GERTIE AND I HIT
THE STREETS OF SOMERVILLE.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.940
IT ONLY TOOK US ABOUT
AN HOUR TO SCORE.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.545
NO, I'M KIDDING, SHE HAS
A PRESCRIPTION--
GLAUCOMA.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.880
( laughs )
I LOVE YOU.

37:10.695 --> 37:14.666
( phone dialing )

37:14.699 --> 37:17.369
Voicemail:
Hey, it's Dominic.
Leave a message.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.570
HEY, DOMINIC, IT'S ME.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.474
UM...

37:22.507 --> 37:24.775
LISTEN, THERE'S GONNA BE
A STORY IN THE PAPER TOMORROW,

37:24.809 --> 37:28.347
THAT I WROTE...

37:28.380 --> 37:30.382
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO FIND OUT LIKE THIS,

37:30.414 --> 37:32.516
BUT EVERY TIME
I TRIED TO TELL YOU

37:32.550 --> 37:33.784
WE JUST KEPT
MISSING EACH OTHER.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.554
AND IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED
THAT IT'S IN THERE,

37:35.586 --> 37:37.789
WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

37:37.822 --> 37:40.358
( sighs )
THAT WAS LIKE
THE LONGEST SENTENCE EVER.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.362
LISTEN, JUST READ IT

37:44.396 --> 37:47.532
AND CALL ME.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.001
JUST CALL ME BACK, OKAY?

38:03.014 --> 38:05.317
HEY, DO YOU NEED
ANY HELP?

38:05.349 --> 38:06.652
- UH, I'M GOOD.
- YEAH?

38:08.586 --> 38:09.987
( chuckles )

38:10.021 --> 38:12.791
YOU KNOW WHAT I
WAS THINKING ABOUT?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.527
THAT HOUSE-WARMING PARTY
THAT YOU AND THOMAS HAD,

38:15.559 --> 38:17.561
WHERE YOU CONNED EVERYBODY
INTO PAINTING AND WALLPAPERING.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.731
REMEMBER THAT?

38:19.764 --> 38:22.067
THE BROOKLINE PLACE,
I LOVED THAT LITTLE HOUSE.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.771
WE DIDN'T CON ANYBODY.
THEY WERE OUR FRIENDS,
THEY WANTED TO HELP.

38:25.804 --> 38:26.938
YOU SPIKED THE LEMONADE.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.706
NEVER BEEN PROVEN.

38:28.739 --> 38:30.976
HOW ABOUT WHEN YOU CLIMBED
ONTO THAT STEP LADDER

38:31.009 --> 38:32.844
AND YOU WERE SINGING
THAT JONI MITCHELL SONG,

38:32.878 --> 38:35.079
WHAT WAS IT?
YOU HIT SOME CRAZY NOTES.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.382
YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S THE PROOF.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.985
OH, MY GOSH,
TO BE THAT YOUNG AGAIN.

38:41.018 --> 38:44.922
EVEN FOR FIVE MINUTES,
ESPECIALLY NOW.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.594
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

38:49.628 --> 38:51.563
I DID SOMETHING THAT DUMB
AND IMPULSIVE.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.748
I... I SHOULD
GET GOING.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.851
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I HAVE TO--
I GOTTA CHECK IN WITH HAMBURG

39:13.885 --> 39:15.119
- AND MAKE SURE...
- RIGHT, OKAY.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.755
- ...EVERYTHING'S SET
FOR TOMORROW.
- SURE.

39:16.788 --> 39:17.789
ALL RIGHT.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.025
- ALL RIGHT.
- HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.492
( chuckles )

AS I WATCHED BRUCE HENDRIE
AT THE DEBATE THE OTHER NIGHT,

40:14.813 --> 40:17.114
I DIDN'T SEE
A WEALTHY BUSINESS MAN

40:17.148 --> 40:19.951
OR A CANDIDATE SEEKING OFFICE
STANDING BEFORE ME.

40:22.119 --> 40:24.155
I SAW A FATHER.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.925
AND I RECOGNIZED THAT LOOK
IN HIS EYES,

40:26.958 --> 40:30.728
THAT TERRIBLE FEAR. BECAUSE
I'VE SEEN THAT SAME FEAR

40:30.762 --> 40:33.931
IN MY OWN MOTHER'S EYES,

40:33.965 --> 40:37.202
AND MY GRANDMA'S EYES,

40:40.070 --> 40:42.673
BECAUSE I HAVE CANCER, TOO.

40:42.706 --> 40:45.076

IT'S A BITCH.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.181

41:04.061 --> 41:07.565

ENLISTED IN THE ARMY.

41:07.599 --> 41:10.467
