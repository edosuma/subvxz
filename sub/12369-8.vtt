WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:03.545
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.628 --> 00:05.463
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.883
- SAY, "NANA."

00:08.967 --> 00:11.469
SAY, "NANA," WILBUR.
NA-NA.

00:11.553 --> 00:16.265
- IT'S OFFICIAL.
MEN OF ALL AGES IGNORE YOU.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.435
- LOOK, SOME OF THE OTHER BABIES
IN WILBUR'S PLAY GROUP

00:18.518 --> 00:20.270
HAVE ALREADY STARTED TALKING.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.771
ACTUALLY, I WAS GETTING
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED,

00:21.855 --> 00:23.481
SO I KNOCKED A FEW MONTHS
OFF HIS AGE.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.317
- YOU LIED ABOUT A BABY'S AGE?

00:26.401 --> 00:28.945
- OH, I WISH MY MOTHER
HAD DONE THAT FOR ME.

00:29.028 --> 00:33.533
BUT NO, I'M A SELF-MADE
THIRTYSOMETHING.

00:33.616 --> 00:37.412
- OKAY, EVERYBODY!
HOW DO I LOOK?

00:37.495 --> 00:40.248
- YOU'RE GIVING OFF A JOY VIBE.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.791
- OH, NO, I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK THAT SLUTTY.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.293
- HEY!

00:43.376 --> 00:46.796
- SHE SAID IT.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.757
ANYWAY, I WANT TO LOOK
A LITTLE SLUTTY.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.467
TONIGHT'S THE BIG NIGHT
WITH ALEC.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.593
AND IT HAS TO BE PERFECT.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.928
I HAVE TO BE PERFECT.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.140
SO I SPENT ALL DAY GETTING
PREPPED AND TWEEZED AND WAXED.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.226
MY WHOLE BODY'S AS SMOOTH
AS A PORPOISE.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.730
OH, HI, EMMET.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.147
- NO NEED FOR EMBARRASSMENT.

01:05.230 --> 01:09.235
GO ON, YOU WERE SAYING
YOU'RE AS SMOOTH AS A PORPOISE.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.653
- MEN LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.489
- WELL, IT ALL DEPENDS.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.158
SOMETIMES YOU LIKE
THE TIGHTLY-MOWED LAWN

01:15.241 --> 01:18.495
OF AN ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDEN.
AND SOMETIMES,

01:18.578 --> 01:22.165
YOU LIKE THE STEAMY JUNGLE
OF THE AMAZON RAINFOREST.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.959
- OH, NO.
WHAT IF ALEC'S AN AMAZON GUY,

01:25.043 --> 01:27.837
AND I DESTROYED THE RAINFOREST?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.173
- OH, MEN ARE NOT NEARLY
AS JUDGMENTAL AS YOU THINK.

01:30.256 --> 01:33.134
WE CARE MORE ABOUT RESPONSE
AND ENTHUSIASM.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.638
IF YOU LIKE THE SHOW,
LET US KNOW.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.516
- ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT
AN ENCORE.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.226
- OH!

01:41.309 --> 01:43.228
I AM SO NERVOUS.
I CAN'T STAND IT.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.730
- THAT'S JUST STAGE FRIGHT.
YOU'LL BE BRILLIANT.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.149
- [sighs]
BYE.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.567
- SHE'S A MESS.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.194
- WELL, WE SHOULD HEAD OUT
AS WELL.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.071
WE HAVE TO BE
ON THE SET BY 8:00 P.M.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.531
- I'M SO EXCITED.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.533
I'M GONNA BE IN
A WOODY ALLEN MOVIE.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.826
WELL, I KNOW I'M JUST AN EXTRA,

01:57.909 --> 02:00.286
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A MOVIE BEFORE.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.663
- DARLING, JUST STAND WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAND

02:01.746 --> 02:04.207
AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
- ESPECIALLY TO THE STARS.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.584
- WELL, I CAN TALK TO YOU.
- OH, NO.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.044
NO, IF YOU EVEN MAKE
EYE CONTACT WITH ME,

02:08.127 --> 02:11.047
I'LL HAVE TO HAVE YOU PHYSICALLY
TOSSED OFF THE SET.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.425
I THINK IT'S SOME SORT
OF UNION THING.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.844
- AH! LIMO'S HERE.
- OOH.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.221
A LIMO.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.766
FINE, I'LL DRIVE MYSELF.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.226
OKAY, YOU TWO ARE
IN CHARGE OF WILBUR.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.686
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.021
ABSOLUTELY NO TV,
AND NO BABY TALK.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.065
- WE PROMISE.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.569
- ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING YOU SAY
IT SOUNDS LIKE BABY TALK.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.571
ANY WAY YOU CAN BUTCH
IT UP A BIT?

02:34.654 --> 02:37.615
- [deep voice] WILL DO.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.410
- BYE, WILBUR.
SAY, "NANA."

02:40.493 --> 02:42.245
NANA.
- [coos]

02:42.328 --> 02:44.914
- I'M JUST HOPING
HIS FIRST WORDS WILL BE "NANA."

02:44.998 --> 02:48.877
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.755
- A LITTLE TV IS NOT GONNA HURT
YOU, RIGHT, WILBUR?

02:52.839 --> 02:56.593
- TV!

02:59.804 --> 03:03.766
- UH-OH.
[deep voice] I MEAN, UH-OH.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.771
[upbeat theme music]

03:08.855 --> 03:13.776
- ♪ BA BA BAH BA
BA BA BAH BA ♪

03:13.860 --> 03:15.069
♪ HEY! ♪

03:15.153 --> 03:19.407

03:19.490 --> 03:20.742

03:20.825 --> 03:23.786
{\an8}- LIAM.
- JOY.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.455
{\an8}- YOU'RE VERY GOOD.
COMPLETELY IN THE MOMENT.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.582
{\an8}- THANKS.
I'M A BIT NERVOUS.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.626
{\an8}NEVER BEEN AN EXTRA BEFORE.
- HMM.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.461
{\an8}- THOUGH I DID PLAY
OSCAR MADISON

03:31.544 --> 03:33.588
{\an8}IN MY HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION
OF <i> THE ODD COUPLE.</i>

03:33.671 --> 03:37.759
{\an8}- OH, ALL-GIRL SCHOOL?
- NO.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.094
{\an8}- ROLL CAMERAS AGAIN.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.973
{\an8}ACTION.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.308
{\an8}CUT.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.810
{\an8}- I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.480
{\an8}- WELL, WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
I WAS THE STAR OF A LITTLE SHOW

03:50.563 --> 03:53.441
{\an8}CALLED <i> THE BOOMERANG GANG.</i>
I WAS THE CHUBBY ONE.

03:53.524 --> 03:58.279
{\an8}MY CATCHPHRASE WAS,
[panting] "WAIT UP, YOU GUYS."

03:58.363 --> 04:00.531
{\an8}- I REMEMBER THAT SHOW.
IT WAS ON IN ENGLAND.

04:00.615 --> 04:05.119
{\an8}OH, I HAD THE BIGGEST CRUSH
ON...YOU

04:05.203 --> 04:06.996
{\an8}- YOU WERE GONNA SAY
RODDY MCNICHOL, WEREN'T YOU?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.498
{\an8}- NO.
- AND NOW HE'S FAT

04:08.581 --> 04:11.000
{\an8}AND I'M SKINNY,
HOW ABOUT THAT?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.502
{\an8}SO ANYWAY, WHEN THE SHOW ENDED

04:12.585 --> 04:14.504
{\an8}I QUIT THE BUSINESS
TO FIND MYSELF.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.173
{\an8}AND I FOUND MYSELF SORRY THAT
I QUIT THE BUSINESS.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.675
{\an8}I WAS TOTALLY BROKE.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.219
{\an8}AND NOW I'M JUST CLAWING
MY WAY BACK IN.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.179
{\an8}SO WHO GAVE YOU THIS GIG?

04:23.262 --> 04:26.307
- OH, A FRIEND OF MINE.
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY WHO.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.309
THIS MOVIE HAS REALLY
DIALED UP HER DIVA.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.560
- OH.
- HOW ABOUT YOU?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.062
- WELL, I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY EITHER,

04:31.145 --> 04:32.855
EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT HIS CAREER STARTED

04:32.939 --> 04:34.524
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
UNGRATEFUL SOD.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.026
- WELL, THEN.
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.988
- WELL, THEN I LIKE YOU.
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT TONIGHT?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.699
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE JUST MET.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.536
- ACTION.
CUT.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.831
- OKAY.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.545
- WOW!

04:55.628 --> 05:00.008
THAT WAS--
YOU ARE--

05:00.091 --> 05:03.678
I MEAN, YOU HOPE.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.096
AND YOU PICTURE.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.890
BUT YOU.

05:07.974 --> 05:12.895
WOW!

05:12.979 --> 05:16.691
- YOU FAKE-PORNED HIM?
- I FAKE-PORNED HIM.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.652
- WHY?
- I PANICKED!

05:19.736 --> 05:21.529
EMMET SAID,
"MEN LIKE ENTHUSIASM,"

05:21.612 --> 05:22.238
SO I WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.740
I MEAN, I WAS LIKE

05:23.823 --> 05:28.411
SOMEONE REVIEWING THEIR
OWN BUSINESS ON YELP.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.121
- YOU SET THE SEX BAR
WAY TOO HIGH.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.998
- I KNOW!

05:32.081 --> 05:33.916
AND NOW HE'S GONNA EXPECT
FAKE-PORN MELANIE EVERY TIME.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.793
I'M GONNA BE SO BUSY
PUTTING ON A SHOW

05:35.877 --> 05:38.588
THAT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO RELAX AND ENJOY IT!

05:38.671 --> 05:41.758
- AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK.
IT'S LIKE TIPPING.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.594
ONCE YOU GO 30%,
YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO 20%.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.720
YOU HAVE TO FAKE
YOUR OWN DEATH

05:45.803 --> 05:47.388
AND FIND A NEW MANICURIST.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.266
[phone beeps]

05:50.349 --> 05:52.518
OOH, IT'S MY CO-STAR
FROM THE RESTAURANT SCENE.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.228
WE MADE A DATE.

05:54.312 --> 05:59.233
- JOY, YOU DON'T DATE EXTRAS.
THAT'S LIKE DATING SCENERY.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.820
- WELL, PASSING OVER LIGHTLY
THAT I'M AN EXTRA,

06:02.904 --> 06:04.781
I LIKE LIAM
AND I'M GOING OUT WITH HIM.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.533
- LIAM? OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DEFINITELY CANNOT DATE HIM.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.118
LIAM IS EMMET'S BROTHER.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.828
- HIS BROTHER?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.956
SO EMMET'S THE UNGRATEFUL
BASTARD WHO STOLE LIAM'S CAREER?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.627
- NO, LIAM IS THE BITTER
HAS-BEEN WHO RESENTS

06:17.710 --> 06:20.922
EMMET'S TALENT AND SUCCESS.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.341
NOW YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS,
BUT AFTER "THE BOOMERANG GANG,"

06:23.424 --> 06:26.594
LIAM DEDICATED HIMSELF
TO HAVING A GOOD TIME.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.763
- HE WAS FINDING HIMSELF.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.431
- WELL, HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
FROM "THE BOOMERANG GANG"

06:30.515 --> 06:34.602
THAT WHAT GOES AROUND,
COMES AROUND.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.521
LIAM WAS TOO DRUNK
TO GO TO AN AUDITION,

06:36.604 --> 06:39.941
SO EMMET READ HIS PART
AND THEY LIKED HIM SO MUCH

06:40.024 --> 06:42.610
THEY REWROTE THE ROLE,
AND A STAR WAS BORN.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.113
- SO, EMMET DID STEAL
LIAM'S CAREER.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.657
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TAKING
FROM THIS STORY, JOY,

06:47.740 --> 06:51.369
THEN YOU REALLY HAVE NO BUSINESS
BEING IN SHOW BUSINESS.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.787
- WELL, MAYBE NOT.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.997
BUT YOU STILL CAN'T DICTATE
WHO I GO OUT WITH.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.792
- BUT SURELY YOU SEE
HOW AWKWARD IT WOULD BE.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.502
BOTH OF US DATING
FEUDING BROTHERS?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.129
AM I RIGHT, MELANIE?

07:01.212 --> 07:04.507
- OH, IT NEVER WORKS OUT
WHEN I TAKE SIDES.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.802
- OH, COME ON, DON'T BE A WIMP.
JUST TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.

07:07.885 --> 07:11.848
- I THINK JOY HAS A POINT.
- WHO ASKED YOU?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.516
- I'M GOING TO GET READY
FOR MY DATE.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.519
- ME TOO.
I'M SEEING ALEC AGAIN TONIGHT.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.230
BUT THIS TIME I'M JUST GONNA
TRY TO RELAX AND NOT FAKE IT,

07:19.313 --> 07:21.983
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,
MEN WANT SOMETHING REAL,

07:22.066 --> 07:24.527
NOT SOME OVER-EXAGGERATED
SEX DOLL, RIGHT?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.989
- [panting] WOW.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.700
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.161
ARE YOU FROM CIRCUS FOLK?

07:33.244 --> 07:36.581
BECAUSE THAT WAS INSANE.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.001
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE DOUBLE-JOINTED.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.004
- NEITHER DID I.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.173
- YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T GONNA
FAKE-PORN HIM ANYMORE.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.258
- I KNOW,
BUT I GOT A LEG CRAMP,

07:47.341 --> 07:51.220
AND I SCREAMED REALLY LOUD
AND HE GOT INTO IT.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.264
SO I WENT EVEN MORE OVERBOARD
THAN LAST TIME.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.559
SO NOW THE SEX BAR
HAS BEEN RAISED REALLY HIGH!

07:56.642 --> 07:59.020
- TO WHICH I SAY, BRAVA!

07:59.103 --> 08:00.688
A PERFORMER CAN NEVER
BE SATISFIED.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.732
- BUT I'M NOT A PERFORMER.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.400
I'M JUST A NICE,
ORDINARY GIRL

08:04.483 --> 08:07.778
WHO WANTS
A NICE, ORDINARY ORGASM.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.447
- EXCELLENT EXIT LINE.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.032
ONLY, NEXT TIME TOSS OFF
THE WORD "ORGASM."

08:11.115 --> 08:13.075
DON'T MAKE SUCH A MEAL OF IT.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.745
- YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA TELL
ALEC THE TRUTH AT WORK TODAY.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.415
- THAT'S A TERRIBLE EXIT LINE.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.626
- IN HER DEFENSE,
IT DOES MAKE THE AUDIENCE WONDER

08:21.709 --> 08:23.085
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.504
- YEAH.
- IT'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.969
- YOU KNOW,
WE MAY BE EXTRAS ON THE SET,

08:32.053 --> 08:33.763
BUT WE ARE NOT
EXTRAS IN THEIR LIVES.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.722
- I KNOW.

08:34.804 --> 08:35.556
HOW DARE EMMET SAY
THAT I CAN'T SEE YOU?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.767
- OR VICTORIA SAY
I CAN'T SEE YOU.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.769
- WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER
BECAUSE WE LIKE EACH OTHER

08:39.852 --> 08:41.729
AND WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.274
- LIKE OUR RESENTMENT
FOR VICTORIA AND EMMET.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.818
NOT THAT RESENTMENT IS
A GOOD BASIS FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

08:47.902 --> 08:48.778
- OH, RIGHT.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.279
RESENTMENT WILL
KEEP YOU TOGETHER FOR WHAT,

08:50.363 --> 08:51.239
14, 15 YEARS TOPS?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.452
[sighs]
HELLO, EMMET.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.079
[door closes]
VICTORIA.

08:58.162 --> 09:01.249
- LIAM, JOY.
- VICTORIA, EMMET.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.960
- JOY, LIAM.

09:04.043 --> 09:09.173
[dog barks]
CHANCE.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.093
WHAT A SURPRISE SEEING YOU OUT
HERE AFTER WHAT WE DISCUSSED.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.136
- WHAT A SURPRISE THAT
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED

09:14.220 --> 09:16.055
THAT YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF ME.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.349
- AND WHAT A SURPRISE
THAT YOU'RE DATING

09:18.432 --> 09:19.767
MY GIRLFRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND

09:19.850 --> 09:21.894
JUST SO THAT YOU CAN
CONSTANTLY BE IN MY ORBIT.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.980
- YET IT'S NO SURPRISE
THAT YOU THINK

09:24.063 --> 09:25.815
YOU'RE THE CENTER
OF THE UNIVERSE.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.484
- WELL, THE MELBOURNE
PLANETARIUM CERTAINLY THOUGHT SO

09:28.567 --> 09:32.321
WHEN THEY CHOSE ME TO BE
THE VOICE OF THE BIG BANG.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.407
- IT'S A GOOD EXIT LINE.
- IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

09:34.490 --> 09:38.035
- MM.
- LET'S GO.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.078
- INSUFFERABLE.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.830
- YOU KNOW, IF WE WANTED
TO GET BACK AT THEM--

09:40.913 --> 09:42.456
- OH, I DON'T WANT
TO GET BACK AT HER.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.958
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.002
BUT DO GO ON.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
- THERE'S A LITTLE TRICK
WE EXTRAS HAVE

09:48.254 --> 09:49.630
CALLED "STEALING FOCUS."

09:49.714 --> 09:51.173
I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
ON THE WAY TO THE SET.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.010
- IS IT DOING SOMETHING
DISTRACTING SO YOU STEAL FOCUS?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.344
- OKAY, WE'LL TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE

09:55.428 --> 09:59.473
ON THE WAY TO THE SET.

09:59.557 --> 10:04.186
- "THE BARN IS BLUE.
THE FARMER WEARS A SHOE.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.855
THE COW SAYS..."

10:05.938 --> 10:09.525
- TV.

10:09.608 --> 10:14.071
- THIS ISN'T WORKING.
THE KID'S A BROKEN RECORD.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.364
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.992
- I WANT TO SEE HOW IT ENDS.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.536
- WILL YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.747
WE HAVE TO FIX THIS.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:22.830 --> 10:26.709
IF JOY FINDS OUT, SHE'LL NEVER
LET US BABYSIT AGAIN.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.003
AND I LOVE HANGING OUT
WITH WILBUR.

10:29.086 --> 10:32.506
HE GETS ME.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.385
- LET'S GET HIM TO SAY SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDS LIKE "TV."

10:36.469 --> 10:39.889
- HOW ABOUT T.B.?

10:39.972 --> 10:43.684
- TUBERCULOSIS?
REALLY?

10:43.768 --> 10:47.688
HOW ABOUT T.D.?
- LIKE TOUCHDOWN?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.065
- MM.
- PERFECT!

10:49.148 --> 10:53.194
WE CAN SAY WE TOOK HIM
TO A BROWNS GAME.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.906
- THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE BROWNS
SCORING A TOUCHDOWN, BUT...

10:56.989 --> 11:00.242
WELL--OH--
T.D.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.371
- TV!

11:03.454 --> 11:06.374
- OH, CRAP,
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

11:06.457 --> 11:11.212
- CRAP.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.922
- ELKA, WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.

11:13.005 --> 11:17.927
- BITCH.

11:18.010 --> 11:22.473
- I MAY HAVE WHISPERED THAT WHEN
YOU ATE THE LAST MINT MILANO.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.312
- ANOTHER AMAZING PRESENTATION.
UNBELIEVABLE!

11:28.396 --> 11:31.315
I-I MEAN, YOU'RE THE BEST.
YOU'RE THE ABSOLUTE BEST.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.443
SO, WHY DON'T WE GO
TO YOUR PLACE AND CELEBRATE?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.611
- MELANIE, HAVE A SEAT.

11:35.694 --> 11:39.615
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME
TO SAY THAT LIKE ANY GUY,

11:39.698 --> 11:43.619
I LOVE PRAISE, BUT I'M RELEASING
YOU FROM HAVING TO GO OVERBOARD.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.287
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.415
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S PRAISE,
AND THEN THERE'S PRAISE.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.668
COME ON.
NOBODY IS THAT GOOD.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.920
- OH, GOD. YOU COULD TELL?
- WELL...

11:53.003 --> 11:54.463
- I WAS JUST SO NERVOUS
THE FIRST TIME.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.798
I WANTED TO BE
REALLY GREAT,

11:55.881 --> 11:58.134
SO I KIND OF WENT
ALL FAKE PORNO ON YOU.

12:00.928 --> 12:01.971
- I'M SORRY?

12:02.054 --> 12:06.809
- OH, GOD. YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT WORK, WEREN'T YOU?

12:06.892 --> 12:10.604
- YOU FAKED IT WITH ME?
BOTH TIMES?

12:10.688 --> 12:12.648
LOCK THE DOOR.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.983
- WAIT, HERE? NOW?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.276
- WELL, WE CAN'T
GO TO MY PLACE.

12:15.359 --> 12:19.238
THE WORKMEN ARE STILL REPAIRING
THE HOLE YOU KICKED IN THE WALL.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.869
- AND ACTION.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.620
- OH, DARLING.

12:26.704 --> 12:31.459
HAVE THERE EVER BEEN
TWO PEOPLE MORE IN LOVE?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.213
CUT!

12:36.297 --> 12:38.883
- 'SCUSE ME, UH,
MR. SIR LAWSON?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.217
YOU CAN'T SAY, "CUT."

12:40.301 --> 12:42.094
- YOU'RE NOT WOODY ALLEN.
WHO ARE YOU?

12:42.178 --> 12:45.347
- IT'S ME GARY,
THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.849
I CALL YOU EVERY NIGHT,
WE TALK ABOUT YOUR SCENES.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.895
- NO, I TALK
TO WOODY EVERY--

12:50.978 --> 12:53.689
OH, DEAR GOD.

12:53.772 --> 12:57.193
WELL, GARY, THESE EXTRAS

12:57.276 --> 13:00.362
ARE PULLING FOCUS
WITH THEIR GRATUITOUS BUSINESS.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.490
- IT'S NOT GRATUITOUS,
IT'S PART OF OUR BACKSTORY.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.574
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

13:03.657 --> 13:07.161
- MAYBE YOU TWO
SHOULD CONGRATULATE US.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.872
- EXTRAS DON'T NEED
A BACKSTORY

13:09.955 --> 13:11.832
ANY MORE
THAN THE SALT SHAKER.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.042
HOW WAS YOUR CHILDHOOD?

13:13.125 --> 13:15.920
DID YOU LABOR
IN THE SALT MINES?

13:16.003 --> 13:17.838
- [laughing]
THAT'S FUNNY.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.757
- NO, IT'S NOT, VICTORIA.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.550
- GARY, WOULD YOU
PLEASE REMIND JOY

13:21.634 --> 13:24.553
THAT EXTRAS ARE NOT
TO ADDRESS THE STARS?

13:24.637 --> 13:28.182
- ANYTHING FOR YOU, VICTORIA.
BEST 2 1/2 MINUTES OF MY LIFE.

13:28.265 --> 13:32.436
AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE.
- IT WAS FINE.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.355
- GARY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.898
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THEM
TO THIS TABLE OVER HERE?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.233
- WE WON'T EVEN
BE ON CAMERA.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.776
- YOU SHOULD BE
USED TO THAT BY NOW.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.361
- YOU BLOODY BASTARD.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.322
I REFUSE TO BE BANISHED
TO CINEMATIC SIBERIA.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.032
- VICTORIA, DO SOMETHING.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.575
- OH, I'M SORRY, JOY,
DO I KNOW YOU?

13:46.659 --> 13:51.288
- FOR GOD SAKES, VICTORIA,
YOU JUST CALLED ME JOY.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.166
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO
SIDE WITH EMMET OVER ME?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.379
- OH, DARLING.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.798
HAVE THERE EVER BEEN
TWO PEOPLE MORE IN LOVE?

14:00.881 --> 14:04.718
- [groans, hacking]

14:04.802 --> 14:08.180
[coughs]

14:15.020 --> 14:16.063
- WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.900
UN-FAKED, STRAIGHT-UP,
REAL DEAL SEX.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.986
- SO NICE.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.366
- YOU MISS THE FAKE PORN,
DON'T YOU?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.659
- NO.

14:28.742 --> 14:33.414
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
NICE IS GOOD.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.083
- OKAY, MAYBE I TONED IT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.793
I'M SORRY, I JUST--
YOU KNOW,

14:37.876 --> 14:40.296
I CAN'T GET MY BRAIN
TO TURN OFF AND STOP THINKING.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.964
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.007
LET'S--
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.926
- RIGHT, RIGHT, WE HAVE TO
PICK THE BEFORE PHOTO

14:46.010 --> 14:47.469
FOR THAT TOENAIL
FUNGUS CREAM CAMPAIGN.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.846
- NOW, SEE,
I LIKE THIS ONE.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.806
IT'S BOTH GREEN,
AND IT'S OOZING SOMETHING GREEN.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.141
- REALLY?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.476
'CAUSE I LIKE
THIS YELLOW, CRUSTY ONE.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.644
YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ABOUT TO BURST.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.895
- HMM.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.564
OOH, THERE'S A GOOD ONE.
- MM.

14:58.647 --> 15:01.025
- THERE'S HARDLY
ANY NAIL BED LEFT.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.116
- WOW.
- WOW.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.826
REAL?
- COMPLETELY.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.162
YOU?
- YEAH.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.789
GUYS CAN'T REALLY FAKE IT.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.499
EXCEPT EMOTIONALLY.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.002
NOT WITH YOU.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.338
- SO, WHY DO YOU
THINK THIS TIME?

15:22.421 --> 15:24.298
OH--OH, NO.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.925
DO YOU THINK IT WAS
THE TOE FUNGUS?

15:27.009 --> 15:30.638
DO WE HAVE SOME VERY WEIRD,
SPECIFIC, SHARED FETISH?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.682
- I HOPE NOT.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.351
BUT I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.
THAT'S HOW GOOD IT WAS.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.019
- [laughs]

15:37.102 --> 15:39.104
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT WAS THE TOE FUNGUS.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.565
- REALLY?
- YEAH, BUT NOT IN A CREEPY WAY.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.777
I THINK IT JUST KIND OF
HUMANIZED THE WHOLE THING.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.029
TOOK PERFECTION
OFF THE TABLE.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.530
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.281
- YEAH,
WE'RE NOT PORN STARS.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.033
- HMM.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.495
- WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
FILMABLE OR PERFECT.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.873
WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE
WHO REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER.

15:57.956 --> 16:01.669
FIND EACH OTHER FASCINATING
AND INTERESTING,

16:01.752 --> 16:04.380
AND EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.217
RIGHT, ALEC?

16:10.636 --> 16:13.180
WELL, THAT'S REAL.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.856
- I TAKE IT FROM THE PIVOT
THAT YOU'RE STILL UPSET.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.982
JOY.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.567
- OH, SO YOU DO
REMEMBER MY NAME.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.403
- OH, COME ON.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.572
I WAS JUST FOLLOWING MOVIE STAR
PROTOCOL VIS-A-VIS EXTRAS.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.950
- MOVIE STAR PROTOCOL?

16:33.033 --> 16:36.370
DO YOU EVEN HEAR YOURSELF?

16:36.453 --> 16:38.414
HOW COULD YOU BANISH ME
FROM THE SET?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.498
- WELL, HOW COULD I NOT,

16:39.581 --> 16:42.418
AFTER YOU AND LIAM MADE THAT
SCENE DURING OUR SCENE?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.920
- YOU AND EMMET DESERVED IT.
YOU THINK NO ONE ELSE MATTERS.

16:45.003 --> 16:46.797
- JOY...

16:46.880 --> 16:50.217
COME ON, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I VALUE OUR FRIENDSHIP.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.386
YOU ARE THE WIND
BENEATH MY WINGS.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.595
- REALLY?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.389
THAT'S HOW YOU SEE ME?

16:55.472 --> 17:00.102
DOWN BELOW, PUFFING AWAY TO KEEP
YOUR BIG, OLD WINGS ALOFT?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.770
- NO, NO, NO,
I MEAN LIKE THE SONG.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.939
- THAT IS THE STUPID SONG!

17:04.021 --> 17:06.608
THE SINGER GETS TO SHINE,
'CAUSE THE SINGEE

17:06.692 --> 17:09.069
HAS TO WALK A STEP BEHIND,
OUT OF THE SUNLIGHT,

17:09.153 --> 17:11.070
HER BEAUTIFUL SMILE
HIDING THE PAIN.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.741
- OH, BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
MY HERO--IT'S A GOOD THING.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.076
- [scoffs] FOR YOU!

17:16.160 --> 17:18.454
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT ONLY THIS MOVIE.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.247
IT'S A PATTERN WITH US.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.374
I MEAN, JUST SINCE
WE MOVED TO CLEVELAND,

17:22.458 --> 17:24.460
YOU'VE HAD ME
PRETEND TO BE YOUR GAY WIFE,

17:24.542 --> 17:27.628
LIE ABOUT YOUR FAKE GOITER,
SEDUCE YOUR CO-ANCHOR,

17:27.713 --> 17:31.216
POISON SUSAN LUCCI!

17:31.300 --> 17:33.260
NEED I GO ON?

17:33.343 --> 17:36.430
- EXCUSE ME, BUT I DO NOT RECALL
PUTTING A GUN TO YOUR HEAD.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.140
WELL, EXCEPT FOR
THAT ONE TIME BACK IN L.A.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.683
WHEN WE WERE
REHEARSING THAT SCENE

17:39.767 --> 17:42.144
WHERE HONOR ST. RAVEN PUT A GUN
TO HER BEST FRIEND'S HEAD.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.189
- AND YOUR HOUSEKEEPER OVERHEARD
US AND CALLED THE POLICE.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.523
I GOT HANDCUFFED!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.442
- YES, BUT THEN WE LAUGHED
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT

17:48.525 --> 17:50.819
WITH THOSE HANDSOME OFFICERS
WHO TOOK US TO DINNER.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.822
- OKAY,
MAYBE THAT PART WAS FUN.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.659
- AND POISONING
SUSAN LUCCI WAS FUN.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.872
- IT WAS, A LITTLE.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.124
- LOOK, JOY, I ADMIT THAT

18:04.208 --> 18:08.629
DATING SIR EMMET LAWSON
AND BEING IN A WOODY ALLEN FILM

18:08.712 --> 18:11.131
MAYBE WENT TO MY HEAD
A LITTLE, AND...

18:11.215 --> 18:15.844
AND I LOST MY MIND, AND I--
AND I WASN'T A VERY GOOD FRIEND.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.681
BUT THIS IS JUST...
SUCH A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.850
- I KNOW IT IS.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.645
BUT THAT DOESN'T
EXCUSE YOUR BEHAVIOR.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.522
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.315
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.274
- THANK YOU.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.986
AND I ADMIT BEING
PART OF YOUR SHENANIGANS

18:33.070 --> 18:36.490
DOES ADD A BIT OF EXCITEMENT
TO MY LIFE.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.660
- SO, TELL ME,
HOW CAN I MAKE THIS UP TO YOU?

18:39.743 --> 18:43.580
- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.208
I'M STILL PRETTY UPSET.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.543
- WHAT IF I GOT YOU
A LINE IN THE MOVIE?

18:47.626 --> 18:49.503
- DONE.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.845
- WILBUR, NANA'S HOME.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.764
WERE YOU A GOOD BOY
FOR ELKA AND MAMIE SUE?

19:00.848 --> 19:01.765
- OH, YES.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.976
WE READ <i> BABY SHAKESPEARE,</i>

19:04.059 --> 19:07.271
LISTENED
TO <i> BABY BEETHOVEN...</i>

19:07.354 --> 19:10.649
I THINK BOTH OF THEM
DID BETTER WORK AS ADULTS.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.238
- WILBUR, DARLING,
SAY, "NANA."

19:16.321 --> 19:17.531
NA-NA.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.491
- NANA.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.536
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

19:22.619 --> 19:25.080
WILBUR JUST SAID HIS FIRST WORD,
AND IT WAS "NANA"!

19:25.163 --> 19:26.957
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
HIS FIRST WORDS--

19:27.040 --> 19:29.585
- ZIP IT.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.505
- I'M GONNA FILM IT.
NOW HAVE HIM DO A SECOND TAKE.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.590
- WILBUR, SAY IT AGAIN.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.425
SAY, "NANA."

19:36.508 --> 19:38.760
- TV.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.599
- DID HE JUST SAY, "TV"?

19:43.682 --> 19:47.102
- I HEARD, "NANA."

19:47.185 --> 19:49.938
- TV.

19:50.022 --> 19:54.067
- THAT'S FROM
<i>BABY SHAKESPEARE.</i>

19:54.151 --> 19:59.072
"TV OR NOT TV."

19:59.156 --> 20:01.825
- OWEN AND I
MADE IT VERY CLEAR.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.329
NO TV, NO PROCESSED SUGAR,
WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.331
- CRAP.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.252
- THAT IS US
WATCHING OUR LANGUAGE.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.922
- THAT'S IT, YOU TWO ARE OFF
THE BABYSITTING LIST.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.131
YOU ARE NEVER
WATCHING WILBUR AGAIN.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.760
- BITCH.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.728
