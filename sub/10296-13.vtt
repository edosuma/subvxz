01:52.167 --> 01:53.167
If you're thinking

01:53.167 --> 01:54.767
about what to get old Dad
for Christmas,

01:54.767 --> 01:55.801
don't worry about it.

01:55.801 --> 01:57.834
You've already given it to him.

01:57.834 --> 02:00.267
It's called a hernia.

02:00.267 --> 02:03.300
Dad, can we go
to that new Lakeside Mall?

02:03.300 --> 02:06.300
Kelly can shop,
you can get bombed,

02:06.300 --> 02:10.167
and I can ride Santa's
very special reindeer.

02:10.167 --> 02:12.934
Dad, why don't we get Bud
one of those scratching posts

02:12.934 --> 02:14.000
to rub against?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.100
You know, it'll save
the furniture.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.534
You really want to save
the furniture, Kel?

02:18.534 --> 02:22.300
Why don't you stop putting
notches on your bedposts?

02:22.300 --> 02:24.667
Now, Bud,
apologize to your sister.

02:24.667 --> 02:25.801
No.

02:25.801 --> 02:27.367
Okay.

02:29.033 --> 02:31.534
So, Dad, can we go
to that new Lakeside Mall?

02:31.534 --> 02:33.133
No, we can't,
and I'll tell you why.

02:33.133 --> 02:35.400
That mall is
killing your father.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.100
Oh, I thought
Mom was doing that.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.133
Let me tell you kids something
about that Lakeside Mall.

02:41.133 --> 02:43.634
It's taken all the business
from my mall,

02:43.634 --> 02:44.968
which, if this continues,

02:44.968 --> 02:46.767
we'll be broke
and living in a cardboard box

02:46.767 --> 02:48.133
under the El.

02:48.133 --> 02:51.133
Not us. We'll be
in a nice warm foster home.

02:51.133 --> 02:52.634
Come on.
Let's go, Kel.

02:52.634 --> 02:53.734
Nobody move.

02:53.734 --> 02:55.734
That mall's not so great.

02:55.734 --> 02:58.734
Just a bunch of stores filled
with cheap, gaudy merchandise

02:58.734 --> 03:00.000
that only appeals

03:00.000 --> 03:01.834
to the tasteless,
low-class shopper.

* Santa Claus is coming

03:08.067 --> 03:11.067
Oh, God,
I love that Lakeside Mall.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.067
Al, give me some money.
I'm going back.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.334
Anyone want to come with me?

03:14.334 --> 03:15.367
I do, I do.
Yeah.

03:15.367 --> 03:16.400
Peggy,

03:16.400 --> 03:17.767
I'm ashamed of you.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.267
I know, Al.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.167
Don't you
understand?

03:23.167 --> 03:24.934
If people
keep shopping there,

03:24.934 --> 03:26.767
we'll be broke
and living under the El.

03:26.767 --> 03:30.534
Oh, not me.
I can always remarry.

03:30.534 --> 03:32.100
And we'll be
in a foster home.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.234
Let's go shopping.

03:33.234 --> 03:35.100
Family, before you go,

03:35.100 --> 03:36.634
would you bring old dad
his shotgun

03:36.634 --> 03:39.000
and stand
close together?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.567
Come on, Al.

03:40.567 --> 03:41.801
I only go to that mall

03:41.801 --> 03:44.434
because it's so much closer
and better than your mall.

03:44.434 --> 03:46.934
I mean, it's not like
I was buying shoes there.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.734
You should see it,
honey.

03:52.734 --> 03:54.200
For Christmas, they have
these little elves

03:54.200 --> 03:55.968
that help you
with your packages,

03:55.968 --> 03:59.534
and a real reindeer
for the kids to ride...

03:59.534 --> 04:01.801
Although I think
he may be dying.

04:01.801 --> 04:03.334
Well, then,
let's hurry.

04:03.334 --> 04:04.567
Yeah, come on, Al.

04:04.567 --> 04:07.400
Santa is parachuting
into the mall at 5:00.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
All right!

04:08.400 --> 04:09.501
Oh, come on.

04:09.501 --> 04:12.033
That's not what
Christmas is about.

04:12.033 --> 04:15.534
Christmas is about
family and giving.

04:15.534 --> 04:20.100
Okay, here's all the crap
my family gave us last year.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.601
It's time for
the traditional rewrapping

04:22.601 --> 04:23.868
of this garbage

04:23.868 --> 04:25.000
for your family.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.367
Now...

04:27.734 --> 04:30.434
Well, all except
Aunt Pooh's fruitcake.

04:30.434 --> 04:31.968
Everyone in the family
already got that.

04:31.968 --> 04:34.334
Dad, you punted that
around the house last year.

04:34.334 --> 04:38.067
All right. We'll give it
to Steve and Marcie.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.701
Now, has anyone
picked out a tree yet?

04:39.701 --> 04:41.501
Oh, you know, the tree
in the Ginty house

04:41.501 --> 04:42.834
sure is pretty this year.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.868
It's got lots
of tinsel on it.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.501
That'll be our tree.

04:46.501 --> 04:48.200
Now, kids, that's your job.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.033
He throws it out
the day after Christmas,

04:50.033 --> 04:51.234
so bring it home.

04:51.234 --> 04:52.601
Right, Dad.

04:52.601 --> 04:55.234
That about does it
for Christmas this year.

04:55.234 --> 04:57.868
Oh, I'm tired.

life worth living.

05:07.434 --> 05:09.534

don't you?

05:09.534 --> 05:13.868
No. We really
love you.

05:13.868 --> 05:15.467
Ah, life stinks.

Well, okay.

05:16.701 --> 05:19.234

my Christmas bonus,

05:19.234 --> 05:21.367
and then I'll go buy
your presents.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.834
Dad, you didn't get
our presents yet?

05:23.834 --> 05:26.167
It's Christmas Eve. The stores
are going to be packed.

05:26.167 --> 05:29.100
Not in my mall, son.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.567
Okay. He's gone.

Now for Daddy's present.

out of Daddy's closet.

05:39.067 --> 05:40.567

05:40.567 --> 05:42.000
Oh, no, no, no. Wait.

It's Christmas. We should
make it special for him.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.868
Bud, get one
of his shirts too.

05:48.868 --> 05:52.334
Oh, gosh.
I just love Christmas.

05:54.701 --> 05:57.033
I can't wait
to see Daddy's face

05:57.033 --> 05:59.767
when he opens it.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.334
That's his
favorite shirt.

06:01.334 --> 06:03.601
Yeah, I saw a belt
up there

06:03.601 --> 06:05.133
that would be great
for his birthday.

see any presents.

in the car, stupid.

when we didn't have too much,

06:58.701 --> 07:00.701

at the poor people

19:54.601 --> 19:57.133
Hey, no problem.
No inconvenience.

19:57.133 --> 19:58.501
You just took
all my business,

19:58.501 --> 19:59.567
cost me my bonus,

19:59.567 --> 20:01.167
made my family hate me.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.968
That's right.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.601
And on top of all that,

20:04.601 --> 20:06.501
you slam-dunked Santa
into my backyard

20:06.501 --> 20:08.734
and almost ruined Christmas for
every kid in the neighborhood.

20:08.734 --> 20:09.934
Almost?

20:09.934 --> 20:12.901
Well, you see,
my husband dressed up as Santa

20:12.901 --> 20:15.234
so the kids would know
he was okay.

20:15.234 --> 20:17.367
By the way,
love your mall.

20:17.367 --> 20:18.701
We've got it all.

20:18.701 --> 20:22.767
So, no one around here
knows what really happened, huh?

20:22.767 --> 20:25.367
Nope. Thanks to me.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.067
Hey, that ought to be
worth something, huh?

20:27.067 --> 20:29.968
Not anymore.

20:29.968 --> 20:33.267
I mean, if the kids think
Santa's okay, Santa's okay,

20:33.267 --> 20:34.467
so why should I bribe you

20:34.467 --> 20:36.734
to say something
you've already said?

20:36.734 --> 20:37.767
It would be stupid,

20:37.767 --> 20:39.367
kind of like
paying that dead guy

20:39.367 --> 20:42.701
for disappointing a whole
parking lot full of kids.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.067
I'm saving money
right and left here.

20:45.067 --> 20:48.667
It's the best Christmas
I've ever had.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.734
Well, that
about wraps it up here.

20:50.734 --> 20:52.067
Roll him out, boys.

20:52.067 --> 20:54.234
You know, Bundy,
you're a decent guy,

20:54.234 --> 20:56.734
so here's a little tip
from me to you.

20:56.734 --> 20:59.334
Don't die
with your jewelry on, huh?

21:03.567 --> 21:06.200
Well, Al,
look at it this way.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.868
You did a nice thing,

21:07.868 --> 21:11.167
cost us a nice bribe
and a shot at a happy Christmas.

21:11.167 --> 21:12.601
Thank your father, kids.

21:12.601 --> 21:14.467
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.

21:14.467 --> 21:17.300
Yeah, I know I let
everybody down.

21:17.300 --> 21:18.901
It's okay, Dad.

21:18.901 --> 21:21.133
It's not like this
never happened before.

21:21.133 --> 21:22.167
Yeah.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.200
I mean, the Santa corpse
was a new twist,

21:24.200 --> 21:26.534
but heck, it's something
to tell a psychiatrist

21:26.534 --> 21:28.000
later on in life.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.033
Yes, it's a Bundy Christmas...

21:31.033 --> 21:34.033
And unfortunately,
we're Bundys.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.100
[CLUNK]

21:35.100 --> 21:36.400
What's that?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.434
I don't know, but if it's dead
and has a red nose,

21:38.434 --> 21:39.901
we'll throw it
in Steve and Marcie's yard.

21:46.601 --> 21:47.868
What is it, Al?

21:47.868 --> 21:49.701
I don't know. It looks
like it fell off the roof.

21:49.701 --> 21:50.934
Hey, look!

21:50.934 --> 21:52.901
It's $10 certificates
from the Lakeside Mall.

21:52.901 --> 21:54.100
Hundreds
of them!

21:54.100 --> 21:56.300
It must have been the bag
Santa had when he jumped!

21:56.300 --> 21:58.100
Oh, we're rich!
We're rich!

21:58.100 --> 21:59.400
I found it!

21:59.400 --> 22:00.634
Thank your father, kids.

22:00.634 --> 22:01.934
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.

22:01.934 --> 22:03.767
Let's go bust the mall.

22:03.767 --> 22:07.067
But first,
a moment of silence,

22:07.067 --> 22:11.334
as we owe a lot
to that jolly, flat man.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.367
Okay, let's go!

22:14.367 --> 22:16.067
