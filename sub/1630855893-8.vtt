WEBVTT

00:22.272 --> 00:23.857
Mom, look.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.000
What is it?

00:43.085 --> 00:44.586
A lead.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.431
Holy shit, it's a limo!

00:59.351 --> 01:00.561
It's a Cadillac!

01:01.311 --> 01:04.647
I bet he's a professional baseball player.
Or a movie star.

01:31.717 --> 01:36.471
Sir... I need to apologize to you. Please.

01:37.723 --> 01:41.351
My secretary misspoke
on the phone with you earlier.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.145
How so?

01:43.145 --> 01:45.647
Calvin Evans was here.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.859
Yeah, he was adopted.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.068
No, sir.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.404
He was taken from us.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.617
Tuberculosis.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.663
When did this happen?

02:01.663 --> 02:03.040
Last summer.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.970
Calvin was an extraordinary boy.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.432
Unparalleled aptitude for the sciences.

02:21.183 --> 02:24.561
He benefited so much
from the Remsen Foundation's support.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.036
Calvin.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.040
I'm sorry... but he doesn't want you.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.474
- <i>Supper at Six</i>. Can I help you?
- <i>Supper at Six</i>. Yes.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.061
Who are those for?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.313
Next time, let me know.
I have a singular florist.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.024
I got them for the office.
You said it was drab.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.777
I wanted to de-drab it.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.030
Well, they're beautiful.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.368
- It doesn't weigh as...
- Thank you.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.870
Good morning.
The Remsen Foundation hasn't called back.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.121
I wasn't going to ask.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.082
But since you've brought it up,
that's very rude of them.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.292
I always make a point
of returning all my outstanding calls

04:52.292 --> 04:53.752
- by the end of the day.
- Of course.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.462
Because you are a citizen
of a civil society.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.297
I mean, Mad's about
to drive down there herself.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.298
- Miss Zott.
- Also--

04:58.298 --> 04:59.216
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.592
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.593
Yes?

05:01.593 --> 05:03.762
Actually, never mind. It's nothing.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.014
Fran, you never have nothing to say.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.643
It's personal. It's not show-related.
So if you wanted to--

05:09.643 --> 05:12.604
That is convenient because
we are friends and also colleagues.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.148
I have a crush on Walter.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.695
- This is fantastic.
- I said, stop smiling.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.990
I can't. I won't.
You must ask him to dinner.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.785
- No. The man asks.
- Not if the man is shy.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.579
Not if the man
doesn't value his self-worth.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.582
Not if the woman is confident.
Not if the woman knows what she wants.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.500
Forget I said anything.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.919
That is impossible.
I have an impeccable memory. You--

05:35.919 --> 05:38.672
- Yes, hello. Hi.
- Phil is asking for you both on the stage.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.466
- Will Walter be there?
- Yes, Walter too.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.260
We'll be right there.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.553
- Thank you.
- Sure.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.847
- I can't wait for this meeting. Walter?
- Forget it.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.640
I can't. Walter.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.018
Swift & Crisp is dead.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.437
Why? Our numbers are holding.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.482
They believe that politics
don't belong in the kitchen.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.111
- May they rest in peace.
- You find this funny?

06:01.111 --> 06:04.406
- No, I don't find racism funny.
- Okay.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.951
So we have our work cut out for us.
We'll find another sponsor.

06:07.951 --> 06:12.414
No. I can't even get a cat food company
to return my calls.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.832
You don't believe me?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.001
You know what?

06:16.001 --> 06:20.756
You mock me, you belittle me,
you dismiss our sponsors.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.800
You think that this show is some kind
of public service.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.678
Well, guess what?
It's not. It's a business.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.055
So here's your deadline.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.974
Two weeks to find a sponsor
or you're fired.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.685
Enjoy these last few days.

06:35.646 --> 06:39.107
We're only missing one vote
to stop the construction of the freeway.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.026
The undecideds are Thompson and Sommers,

06:41.026 --> 06:43.195
and neither is conveniently
returning my calls.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.324
Really?

06:48.742 --> 06:49.785
Thank you.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.415
Is everything okay?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.834
We have it.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.839
Thompson is out, but Sommers is in!
We have the vote.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.590
You're sure?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.218
It only took seven years,
three hundred motions

07:06.218 --> 07:09.012
and half-a-dozen trips to Sacramento,
but surly, old,

07:09.012 --> 07:10.764
beautiful Sommers is in.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.559
- Anything for me to do?
- Yes.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.435
Pray that that man
doesn't drop dead of a heart attack

07:15.435 --> 07:17.688
- before Tuesday's vote.
- I'm headed to church.

07:17.688 --> 07:21.066
Go. Yes!

07:24.528 --> 07:26.071
- She's just so clever.
- Oh, my God.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.948
I can't believe
that she actually called herself.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.993
- What if she comes?
- Good morning.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.954
Welcome back into town, sir.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.456
What am I missing?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.542
Elizabeth Zott personally called,

07:38.542 --> 07:40.460
not once, not twice, but three times.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.753
Who's Elizabeth Zott?

07:41.753 --> 07:45.382
Elizabeth Zott! <i>Supper at Six</i>?
She's on television.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.134
Why does she want to talk to me?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.427
That's what we're desperate to know.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.304
Well, I'm on the edge of my seat.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.431
Get her on the line, please.

08:11.742 --> 08:15.495
Well, surely there should be a higher bar
to applause than stuffing mushrooms.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.418
Did you know that there are over
10,000 mushrooms varietals in the world,

08:21.418 --> 08:23.378
but only four to five percent are edible?

08:25.964 --> 08:28.217
When you think about it,
it's sort of like humans.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.886
There's only four to five percent
that I find digestible,

08:30.886 --> 08:31.970
wouldn't you agree?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.267
While we wait
for these mushrooms to roast,

08:37.267 --> 08:38.809
why don't we have a little Q&A?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.063
Right here.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.900
Second row from the back.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.989
Miss Zott, I'm sure you don't remember me.
But I was here a few months ago.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.159
Dr. Fillis, open heart surgeon.
Of course, I remember.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.246
Well, not quite yet.

08:57.246 --> 09:00.707
But I did get accepted
into USC medical school.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.963
I knew you would. I knew you could.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.925
I'm the oldest student in the class
and I'm constantly exhausted,

09:09.925 --> 09:12.845
but I've also never been happier.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.181
Now that is worthy of applause.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.613
I just wanna thank you
for seeing something in me

09:31.613 --> 09:33.574
that I didn't see in myself.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.703
Thank you.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.916
Are there any other questions?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.668
Right here.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.382
You know,
in all of the excitement of the day,

09:50.382 --> 09:55.345
I forgot to tell you
about a giant opportunity. Big.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
I'm all ears.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.057
Woodrow Wilson Middle School asked you

09:59.057 --> 10:00.934
to be the judge
of their sixth grade science fair.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.856
I politely declined on your behalf.

10:06.857 --> 10:10.319
No. I'll do it.
Anything to distract my mind.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.321
Really?

10:12.321 --> 10:13.655
Really.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.617
I will call and make it so.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.245
Walter, are you currently dating someone?

10:20.245 --> 10:23.207
No. I function best alone.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.876
I used to think that too.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.879
- And then?
- I met Calvin.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.261
If the opportunity presents itself--
love, I mean--

10:37.930 --> 10:39.264
I'd like you to consider it.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.269
God, I feel like I'm in a shrink's office.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.688
Well...

10:48.440 --> 10:50.651
Off to call more sponsors.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.735
Walter...

10:55.364 --> 10:59.826
Doing this was not...
what I asked for or what I wanted.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.665
But now that I feel the show
being pulled away from me,

11:06.333 --> 11:09.002
I feel like a piece
of me is going with it.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.923
Elizabeth.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.883
I am your producer.

11:15.509 --> 11:21.139
It is my professional duty
and my personal choice to have your back.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.518
Whatever happens, that won't change.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.396
Thank you.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.856
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:28.856 --> 11:32.192
I have to go RSVP to a bunch
of six graders on your behalf.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.998
Elizabeth Zott.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.917
Yes, it's the real Elizabeth Zott.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.673
Yes, but I would prefer to meet in person.
What is your address?

12:01.972 --> 12:03.849
- Are you nervous?
- No.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.269
Because it would be perfectly fine
to be nervous.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.730
- I'm nervous.
- You are?

12:10.939 --> 12:11.857
I am.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.527
It's you and me.

12:29.666 --> 12:33.629
I've never seen this one. He's so serious.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.550
Sorry I'm late. Harry Wilson.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.303
I told my wife you were coming by,

12:41.303 --> 12:44.389
and she shrieked like you were Elvis.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.099
How can I help you?

12:48.018 --> 12:51.772
Mr. Wilson, this may sound peculiar,

12:51.772 --> 12:54.858
but we are here to ask some questions
about Calvin Evans.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.280
Why did the Remsen Foundation
support Calvin his whole life?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.743
I'm sorry, how do you know Calvin Evans?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.204
He--

13:11.208 --> 13:13.502
This is Mad, my daughter.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.754
Mine and Calvin's.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.721
Please...

13:25.472 --> 13:31.353
Please, hold on.
It's not for me to explain.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.070
Oh, my goodness.

13:53.959 --> 13:54.960
Hi.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.838
Ms. Parker, I have an urgent message.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.988
You must be Mad. I'm Avery.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.115
I'm your...

14:27.743 --> 14:28.869
Calvin's mother.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.247
It's okay.

14:36.210 --> 14:37.294
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.005
Come on, bunny.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.892
There's so much I wanna ask, but--

14:51.892 --> 14:54.603
Why did you give my dad
to that boys' home?

14:57.356 --> 14:58.815
I...

15:02.653 --> 15:05.155
If it's okay, I think
I'd like to start from the beginning.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.661
When I was 16,

15:11.745 --> 15:15.499
I got pregnant accidentally.

15:19.294 --> 15:23.674
Here you go. All right. Easy.

15:23.674 --> 15:27.177
<i>Having a baby was
the most extraordinary thing</i>

15:27.177 --> 15:29.304
<i>that had ever happened to me.</i>

15:30.722 --> 15:32.724
<i>But like most things in my life,</i>

15:32.724 --> 15:36.854
<i>my parents had other plans,
and I had no say.</i>

15:36.854 --> 15:38.689
No. Please. No.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.443
I didn't know where they brought him.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.529
I had no picture of him.

15:47.114 --> 15:51.660
But the one wish that they did honor
was his name. Calvin.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.956
I only knew him for a matter of minutes,

15:55.956 --> 16:00.419
but his existence
changed the entire course of my life.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.089
When I turned 25,

16:04.089 --> 16:06.925
I gained access to my trust fund,

16:06.925 --> 16:11.138
<i>and I hired a lawyer
to help me find Calvin.</i>

16:11.138 --> 16:13.599
<i>Wilson became like a father to me.</i>

16:14.892 --> 16:17.394
I also started the Remsen Foundation

16:17.394 --> 16:21.356
<i>and donated money to boys' homes
within a 300-mile radius</i>

16:21.356 --> 16:23.275
<i>in hopes that I could help him from afar.</i>

16:25.068 --> 16:26.153
We never stopped looking.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.949
And then, one day,

16:30.949 --> 16:35.412
it was as if the clouds lifted
and the heavens parted,

16:35.412 --> 16:37.581
<i>and Wilson managed to find him,</i>

16:38.916 --> 16:42.711
<i>only to be told that he had recently died.</i>

16:47.299 --> 16:50.135
That hope popped like a balloon.

16:51.887 --> 16:52.971
It flattened me.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.808
Wasn't until that magazine cover

16:57.643 --> 17:02.105
<i>decades later that I saw him again.</i>

17:17.204 --> 17:20.457
I don't much care
who's responsible for miracles.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.292
I only cared that this miracle was mine.

17:24.586 --> 17:28.339
I wrote letter after letter,
asking to meet him...

17:29.633 --> 17:31.134
<i>but I never heard back.</i>

17:34.721 --> 17:36.014
And then, one day...

17:39.685 --> 17:42.896
<i>I received a letter
in the mail from a law office.</i>

17:42.896 --> 17:44.815
<i>It was a cease and desist.</i>

17:45.983 --> 17:47.359
I thought he hated me.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.153
That he wanted nothing to do with me.

17:50.779 --> 17:54.658
And he had every right.
I mean, I'd have hated me too.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.080
I came by your house once.

18:01.456 --> 18:05.002
I saw the two of you together.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.172
He looked so happy.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.174
So at peace.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.221
And I knew it was time
for me to let him go.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.271
Had I known he had a child...

18:27.858 --> 18:29.318
I'm so sorry.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.196
He thought that you were dead.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.074
What a poor boy to believe that.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.204
Tell me,

18:41.705 --> 18:43.040
what did I miss?

18:44.041 --> 18:45.751
Who was this man?

18:48.712 --> 18:52.758
He was brilliant, decent and kind.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.806
And a very funny dancer.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.685
I'm a funny dancer.
Are you a funny dancer too?

19:05.521 --> 19:06.688
I don't know.

19:09.483 --> 19:14.154
You know, I had hoped that we could
get to know each other a little bit.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.241
I never got the chance with Calvin,

19:17.241 --> 19:21.119
and I'd give anything
to get to know his daughter.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.542
My granddaughter.

19:29.253 --> 19:34.842
It's been a long journey to get here,
and we're gonna need some time.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.053
- Of course.
- Yeah.

19:40.472 --> 19:44.726
Can I ask, why did you name him Calvin?
Was that a family name?

19:45.519 --> 19:47.813
No, I named him after John Calvin.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.482
I'm not sure I know who that is.

19:51.942 --> 19:55.153
He was a 16th-century theologian

19:55.153 --> 19:58.365
that your great-great-grandmother
used to read to me.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.451
He believed in predestination.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.789
A theologian.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.210
That would have delighted him.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.382
I hope to hear from you soon.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.324
Do you wanna talk about today?
About meeting your grandmother?

20:42.534 --> 20:45.621
I thought that when I got
to the end of the mystery,

20:46.121 --> 20:47.998
it was going to feel different.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.043
Well, in science,

20:51.043 --> 20:53.629
discoveries usually lead
to more questions.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.257
I don't wanna ask more questions.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.343
I just want my dad.

21:02.221 --> 21:05.474
I know. I miss him so much.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.979
But you know, I see him in you.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.773
You do?

21:18.278 --> 21:21.532
You know how your brow crinkles
when you're frustrated?

21:22.032 --> 21:24.409
Or how you always read three books
at once?

21:25.118 --> 21:29.915
Or how you forget to eat sometimes when
you're thinking so much? That's all him.

21:32.501 --> 21:37.172
Dad told Wakely that <i>Great Expectations</i>
was his favorite book.

21:37.923 --> 21:38.924
And it's mine too.

21:42.636 --> 21:45.222
You know that coloring book you have,
the paint by numbers?

21:47.099 --> 21:52.229
Imagine that every person that you meet,
every place that you go,

21:52.896 --> 21:56.692
every letter that you read about your dad
is just another color,

21:57.234 --> 21:58.652
painting in the picture of him.

22:01.864 --> 22:03.448
That's a metaphor.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.533
It is.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.036
Hey, do you wanna play hooky
with me tomorrow?

22:08.620 --> 22:10.539
I played hooky with you today.

22:10.539 --> 22:13.000
I know. You're getting very good at it.

22:21.842 --> 22:25.012
When your eyes see the image
through the red and blue filters,

22:25.012 --> 22:27.222
the image
appears to be coming right at you.

22:30.684 --> 22:34.688
Well, that is a very meticulous drawing
of a panther. Thank you.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.609
Well, what do you think?

22:39.276 --> 22:41.236
I prefer the humanities.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.740
And what do we have here?

22:45.324 --> 22:47.326
Well, my father owns a bakery,

22:47.826 --> 22:50.037
and I wanted to test
the effects of different environments

22:50.037 --> 22:51.663
for slowing the growth of mold.

22:51.663 --> 22:54.166
Wow. Well, that will be
very helpful to your father.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.709
Do you wanna be a baker when you grow up?

22:56.293 --> 22:59.379
No, I wanna be a biologist.

23:00.214 --> 23:04.510
You do? Well, have you read
Charles Darwin's <i>Descent of Man</i>?

23:05.093 --> 23:07.763
Or Erwin Schrödinger's <i>What Is Life</i>?

23:07.763 --> 23:09.932
I have not, but I will. Thank you.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.601
Of course. Best of luck to you.

23:15.771 --> 23:18.649
- I love watching you on TV...
- Thank you, bunny.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.818
...but I don't think you belong there.

23:23.987 --> 23:24.988
Where do I belong?

23:24.988 --> 23:26.573
A laboratory.

23:28.325 --> 23:29.826
Well, I made a choice.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.329
A choice that I would make
a thousand times over.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.705
But I will always be a chemist.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.999
Chemists do chemistry.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.222
Charlie, tell me if this is long enough.

23:50.222 --> 23:53.183
This looks really long. This looks great.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.185
- Make it a bit longer.
- Are you sure?

23:57.938 --> 23:58.939
Make it a little longer.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.568
Why don't we drink
spiced cider year-round?

24:02.568 --> 24:04.611
One of life's great mysteries.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.446
Here you go, Junior.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.615
How's Mad feeling about Calvin's mother?

24:10.158 --> 24:11.159
I don't know.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.579
I don't know where she fits.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.541
You, Charlie, Linda, Junior,
you're our family.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.836
You and Mad
are definitely part of our family,

24:21.336 --> 24:24.131
but if you recall,
that's not where we started.

24:25.549 --> 24:30.637
I just want Mad to feel safe and be loved.
And she has all of that.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.682
You say that like love is finite.

24:34.975 --> 24:38.187
It never hurts to have more people
who love and care for that little girl.

24:39.897 --> 24:43.192
Which reminds me,
I have not properly thanked you

24:43.192 --> 24:46.153
for saving that little girl's home
and the rest of the neighborhood.

24:47.613 --> 24:48.614
Goodness.

24:49.323 --> 24:52.326
Well, we're not there yet,
but after Tuesday's vote,

24:52.326 --> 24:55.537
I do expect a lifetime of beer
and blueberry pie for my efforts.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.210
The freeway here...

25:03.378 --> 25:06.131
is just one version of what they're doing
to communities like ours

25:06.131 --> 25:07.216
all over this country.

25:09.218 --> 25:12.679
The fight can't stop in Sugar Hill
or even California.

25:14.890 --> 25:18.519
Now, I may not have cameras on me,
but I'm a one-woman bullhorn.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.147
And so are you.

25:23.357 --> 25:26.568
For a few more weeks, anyway.
We still haven't found our sponsor.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.655
Something tells me
you're not shutting up anytime soon.

25:34.201 --> 25:37.037
Isn't this great?

25:37.663 --> 25:40.207
If we didn't have a ceiling,
I'd say it's beautiful.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.920
Now, all right. Let me get in there
before this man hurts himself.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.506
I know you're not
putting your shoes on my couch.

25:49.550 --> 25:50.551
This man.

25:52.678 --> 25:55.681
- Should we continue it?
- Keep going.

26:00.477 --> 26:02.729
- Is there any word? What are we doing?
- She's never late.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.523
What do we do if she doesn't show?

26:04.523 --> 26:05.524
Can you cook?

26:05.524 --> 26:08.569
I can scoop ice cream into a bowl.
Does that count?

26:08.569 --> 26:10.237
Uh-uh.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.489
You know what?
I'll have Harry drive by her house.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.449
- Hey, Harry--
- Thank God.

26:14.449 --> 26:17.619
Sorry. I'm sorry. I had an appointment
across town, and it went over.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.372
Harry, these are for the audience.
Please place one of these under each seat.

26:20.372 --> 26:21.707
- There's another box in my car.
- Okay.

26:21.707 --> 26:24.251
Hi, Walter. I'm gonna need to
make a phone call before the show starts.

26:24.251 --> 26:26.920
- There is no time.
- Five minutes, people!

26:27.546 --> 26:30.841
Let's go. Perfect is the enemy of good.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.760
- You all right?
- I'm well. How are you?

26:34.261 --> 26:36.180
You have a look on your face. What is it?

26:36.680 --> 26:37.681
Clarity.

27:00.579 --> 27:03.165
<i>And now,</i> Supper at Six
<i>with Elizabeth Zott.</i>

27:11.548 --> 27:15.344
We're live in five, four, three...

27:27.648 --> 27:32.319
Hello. My name is Elizabeth Zott,
and this is <i>Supper at Six</i>.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.369
I will be starting today's show
with a few announcements.

27:41.245 --> 27:45.415
Before we dive into the chemical compounds
of a baked-ham glaze,

27:45.415 --> 27:49.795
you may notice that there are no
Swift & Crisp products littering our set.

27:49.795 --> 27:52.130
Well, that is because
they dropped our show.

27:52.756 --> 27:55.092
And for that, I thank them.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.930
I know that everyone doesn't stand
for what I stand for,

28:00.514 --> 28:02.766
but our convictions mean nothing
if we don't voice them.

28:02.766 --> 28:06.228
Swift & Crisp is vile
on a sub-chemical level.

28:06.228 --> 28:08.772
Seed oils are damaging
to your mitochondria.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.816
<i>And the fact that I told you
to put that in your body</i>

28:10.816 --> 28:12.651
<i>will haunt me for the rest of my days.</i>

28:13.777 --> 28:18.532
But luckily, we have a new sponsor.
One that aligns with our values.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.703
Tampax.

28:25.414 --> 28:26.373
When did this happen?

28:27.332 --> 28:28.876
I have no idea.

28:28.876 --> 28:31.086
I have been using Tampax for years.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.964
They are soft, durable and hygienic.

28:33.964 --> 28:36.425
Please look under your seat.
There's a present for you.

28:41.847 --> 28:45.434
For the men watching who haven't
bothered to ask about menstruation,

28:45.434 --> 28:46.518
I'll explain it to you.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.606
It is the process where blood discharges
from the lining of the uterus

28:50.606 --> 28:52.983
in intervals of one lunar month,

28:54.026 --> 28:56.695
<i>from puberty to menopause,
except during pregnancy.</i>

28:59.156 --> 29:02.284
I had a call with the head of our network
this afternoon and relayed that to him.

29:02.284 --> 29:03.535
And he agreed with me.

29:03.535 --> 29:05.704
She said the word "uterus" to Kenneth?

29:05.704 --> 29:09.082
...a partner we can be proud of. But that
was not the sole purpose of my call.

29:13.629 --> 29:14.922
I am leaving <i>Supper At Six</i>.

29:18.926 --> 29:22.679
Did you know about this?
This is not what we discussed.

29:23.764 --> 29:26.099
I will be stepping down on live TV.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.810
And as someone
who has studied television exhaustively,

29:28.810 --> 29:31.522
I predict an uptick in viewership
for the next few weeks.

29:31.522 --> 29:35.817
Hosting this show
has been the thrill of a lifetime.

29:37.528 --> 29:40.447
And I have every single one of you
to thank for that.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.619
We set out to do something that matters,
and I believe that we did.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.371
And, Kenneth,

29:47.871 --> 29:50.666
I will be doing all of this under
the condition that changes will be made.

29:53.585 --> 29:56.964
Kenneth. If I knew you were coming,

29:56.964 --> 29:58.799
I would have broken out the good stuff.

29:59.675 --> 30:00.676
You're fired.

30:01.552 --> 30:02.761
The show is yours.

30:10.269 --> 30:14.273
Every night, I ask your children
to give you a moment to yourself

30:15.774 --> 30:19.069
and, well,
I think it's time that I did just that.

30:21.321 --> 30:25.826
<i>It is time for me to reflect,
regroup and figure out what is next.</i>

30:28.620 --> 30:32.291
I bet you're wondering who
the next host of <i>Supper At Six</i> will be.

30:33.375 --> 30:36.044
Well, it will be one of you.

30:40.174 --> 30:41.925
Now, I know that that might sound scary.

30:42.467 --> 30:45.596
But remember,
courage is the root of change.

30:45.596 --> 30:48.599
And change is
what we are chemically designed for.

30:50.392 --> 30:53.020
I will not ask you to pull yourself up
by your bootstraps

30:53.020 --> 30:56.356
because many women do not have
bootstraps to pull themself up by.

30:58.108 --> 31:00.527
If your life has been anything like mine,

31:01.278 --> 31:03.906
your dreams will not come to you
in a linear fashion.

31:05.991 --> 31:08.535
But if you have
a voice you feel is not being heard,

31:10.162 --> 31:11.413
we would love to meet you.

31:17.169 --> 31:19.796
And with that, let's discuss glazed ham.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.263
Can I take you to dinner tonight?

31:29.765 --> 31:34.645
You wanna discuss the reshuffling...

31:35.687 --> 31:39.358
To discuss my feelings for you.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.612
What? Yes.

31:43.612 --> 31:46.698
I would very much like that.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.242
I'll pick you up at 6:45.

32:07.261 --> 32:08.595
Sorry for the delay.

32:09.096 --> 32:12.182
As soon as Councilman Sommers joins us,
we will begin.

32:19.857 --> 32:21.942
Thank you for joining us, Councilman.

32:24.862 --> 32:25.737
We're now on the record.

32:29.032 --> 32:32.286
The interstate highway system
is the future of this nation

32:32.870 --> 32:36.957
for the economy,
for growth and for national defense,

32:36.957 --> 32:38.458
should that ever be necessary.

32:39.543 --> 32:42.462
I'd like to thank both parties
for arguing so vociferously

32:42.963 --> 32:45.048
and passionately
over the past eight years.

32:45.841 --> 32:47.885
Progress has been halted long enough.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.139
So, in the matter of
the California interstate highway system

32:52.139 --> 32:53.891
versus the West Adams/Sugar Hill committee,

32:54.641 --> 32:58.729
all those opposed to routing the highway
through West Adams/Sugar Hill?

33:07.571 --> 33:08.572
All in favor?

33:12.826 --> 33:14.036
The motion is passed.

33:40.646 --> 33:43.440
I tried calling.
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

33:51.240 --> 33:52.491
Seven years.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.329
I just wanna eat brownies and cry.

33:58.121 --> 33:59.373
I can help with that.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.042
Brought beer.

34:03.168 --> 34:04.378
Beer could be good too.

34:06.713 --> 34:08.130
Come here.

34:24.523 --> 34:27.400
Three-quarter
going into full pressure in two.

34:28.694 --> 34:29.695
That's one.

34:31.864 --> 34:32.864
That's two.

34:33.782 --> 34:34.616
Full pressure.

35:02.019 --> 35:04.605
This is the place
where Calvin came to quiet his mind.

35:05.355 --> 35:09.443
I wanted to share it with you.
We had our first kiss right over there.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.112
Thank you for bringing me.

35:13.447 --> 35:16.533
Seeing Mad
with those giant, inquisitive eyes

35:16.533 --> 35:18.869
made me feel
like I was seeing a piece of him.

35:20.996 --> 35:22.206
She's smart, huh?

35:22.706 --> 35:23.707
Terrifyingly.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.752
I caught your show the other night.
You quit.

35:27.586 --> 35:30.047
I did. I want to get back to science.

35:31.507 --> 35:35.010
You know, I have
a foundation specifically geared

35:35.010 --> 35:37.304
toward funding the work of scientists.

35:37.804 --> 35:38.805
I am aware.

35:39.681 --> 35:43.810
Your application offers a "Mr.", no "Mrs."
and certainly not a "Miss."

35:45.896 --> 35:46.980
Well, I'll fix that.

35:47.814 --> 35:48.649
And after I do,

35:49.483 --> 35:52.653
I'd love to help you with whatever it is
you're interested in pursuing.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.864
Though I have the feeling
that you don't like help.

35:57.533 --> 36:01.453
No. As I've gotten older,
I've found help to be a gift.

36:38.657 --> 36:43.328
Hello. My name is Elizabeth Zott,
and welcome to Introduction to Chemistry.

36:44.705 --> 36:47.624
Please pass this to the person next to you
or behind you.

36:50.085 --> 36:52.838
And it is Miss Zott
until I graduate from the PhD program.

36:54.798 --> 36:57.301
Living things are made up of atoms.

36:57.801 --> 37:01.013
But, in most cases, those atoms
are not floating around individually.

37:01.597 --> 37:04.683
Instead, they are usually
interacting with other atoms.

37:05.934 --> 37:08.604
Both the strong bonds
that hold molecules together

37:08.604 --> 37:11.648
and the weaker bonds that create
temporary connections

37:11.648 --> 37:13.984
are essential
to the very existence of life.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.028
Yes?

37:16.028 --> 37:18.614
Is it random which atoms are connected?

37:19.698 --> 37:21.450
Think of your own life.

37:22.201 --> 37:23.911
You can't anticipate the moments.

37:24.494 --> 37:27.623
It's only when you look backwards
that you see how it was all connected.

37:28.457 --> 37:30.083
What does this have to do with chemistry?

37:31.502 --> 37:32.503
Everything.

37:34.171 --> 37:37.758
The only constant variable
in a chemical reaction is change.

37:38.509 --> 37:39.510
The unexpected.

37:40.844 --> 37:43.263
Our job here is not to avoid surprise.

37:44.014 --> 37:45.307
We can't control it.

37:45.891 --> 37:47.601
So there's only one thing left to do.

37:51.271 --> 37:52.397
Surrender.

37:52.940 --> 37:56.026
Now, we don't have to accept
the bad things,

37:56.026 --> 37:59.571
but we do have to accept
the inevitability of change.

38:00.405 --> 38:02.491
Both in ourselves and our circumstances.

38:06.662 --> 38:07.829
Charles Dickens.

38:09.373 --> 38:11.542
Not exactly known for his work
in the sciences.

38:14.795 --> 38:17.172
But the greatest scientist
that I have ever known

38:17.172 --> 38:19.174
kept this book on his bedside.

38:19.967 --> 38:21.802
He said it made him a better chemist.

38:22.636 --> 38:23.887
I laughed it off at the time

38:23.887 --> 38:26.181
because I found it to be
an absurd thing to say,

38:26.181 --> 38:27.599
which I'm sure you do now.

38:28.684 --> 38:31.436
However, I eventually relented and...

38:32.020 --> 38:33.981
and this is the page
that he had dog-eared.

38:38.527 --> 38:42.573
"That was a memorable day to me,
for it made great changes in me.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.037
<i>But, it is the same with any life.</i>

38:53.417 --> 38:55.794
<i>Imagine one selected day struck out of it,</i>

38:57.754 --> 39:00.174
and think how different
its course would have been."

39:11.268 --> 39:13.020
"Pause, you who read this,

39:13.020 --> 39:17.316
<i>and think for a moment
of the long chain of iron or gold,</i>

39:18.692 --> 39:20.360
<i>of thorns or flowers...</i>

39:22.362 --> 39:23.864
<i>that would never have bound you,</i>

39:25.032 --> 39:27.826
<i>but for the formation of the first link</i>

39:29.036 --> 39:31.288
<i>on one memorable day."</i>

39:40.214 --> 39:43.008
Thank you! Thank you for everything.

39:50.265 --> 39:51.517
I love this so much.

39:59.525 --> 40:00.609
And what do we have here?

40:38.814 --> 40:40.148
Let's begin, shall we?
