WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:10.632
Democracy is the future
of our great nation.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.008
We must proceed
with the dissolution of this Council,

00:13.113 --> 00:16.879
which we have seen
can be influenced and corrupted.

00:17.217 --> 00:21.176
I hereby formally propose we hold
a public referendum on the subject

00:21.288 --> 00:25.554
so that all Jaffa can participate
in the decision before us.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.221
Thank you, Brother Maz'rai.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.162
Your wisdom is always
greatly appreciated by the Council.

00:34.034 --> 00:38.027
Now I call Sister Ka'lel as the last speaker

00:39.272 --> 00:41.206
before rebuttal will be heard.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.106
Brother Bra'tac,
I'm afraid I must begin rebuttal

00:46.213 --> 00:48.511
against dissolution of the Council.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.475
Our people are not yet ready
for this burden, Bra'tac.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.281
You underestimate them, sister.

00:54.387 --> 00:58.448
My position on this Council
was secured by the might of the Haktyl,

00:58.859 --> 01:00.793
but it is well known that many regions

01:00.894 --> 01:04.295
do not yet recognize any rights
for females,

01:04.397 --> 01:06.922
Iet alone the right to vote on their destiny.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.725
I agree. There must be change.

01:09.836 --> 01:13.237
Such change must occur
prior to a general vote,

01:13.340 --> 01:17.174
so that its results can be viewed
as fair and representative.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.940
(ALL WHISPERING)

01:27.020 --> 01:29.545
Ka'lel. Ka'lel!

01:30.924 --> 01:33.893
Did she not just speak of her support
for our proposal just this morning?

01:33.994 --> 01:36.792
Privately, yes.
I would not have called on her otherwise.

01:36.897 --> 01:41.129
-Then why would she betray us in session?
-Someone has influenced her.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.770
Still, I have always believed Ka'lel
to be honorable.

01:44.871 --> 01:48.363
Is there no end to this duplicity
we must face?

01:49.476 --> 01:52.445
Sometimes I fear I have gotten
too old for this, brother.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.877
Indeed.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.744
And yet this is what results when we
leave such decisions to the rash of youth.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.452
I will speak with her.

02:06.726 --> 02:07.954
Ka'lel.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.825
-Please forgive the intrusion.
-Not at all.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.063
I'm glad you are here. We must speak.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.928
May I ask why
you did not support our proposal?

02:19.372 --> 02:21.135
Now is not the time.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.232
We have no choice, Ka'lel.

02:24.811 --> 02:29.373
I'm afraid, as far as you are concerned,
that is true.

03:42.455 --> 03:45.390
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell.
I'm here to see Bryce Ferguson.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.652
-Colonel Mitchell?
-Yes, ma'am.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.524
-Hello, I'm Dr. Kelly.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.561
-I've had a chance to see your friend.
-Great.

03:52.666 --> 03:56.295
-Dr. Lam says you're the best.
-Well, that's very nice of her to say.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.496
I'm not aware
of any official ranking system.

03:58.605 --> 04:02.006
Well, I'm sure you'll be a little
better than Fergie's HMO back in lowa.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.576
Well, I'll do what I can.
I've ordered some tests.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.872
It should give us a better idea
of what we're looking at.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.175
Yeah, he's had that shrapnel for a while.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.977
They just found the aneurysm
few weeks ago.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.143
He probably had it the whole time
and didn't know it.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.983
He said his doctors back home
had thrown in the towel on this one.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.683
Well, I won't lie to you.
It's in a tricky spot.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.987
But, as you know,
we have access to certain technology

04:21.094 --> 04:24.495
-not available to everyone else just yet.
-Yes, ma'am. Thanks.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.323
I was told he's not privy
to classified material.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.368
-No.
-So, you got him in here,

04:29.469 --> 04:33.929
-but you couldn't get him clearance?
-That is a whole other ball of wax.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.975
The irony is, he probably would have
had my spot in the 302 program,

04:37.077 --> 04:40.535
if he hadn't been injured.
He's a better pilot than I ever was.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.212
Better than most, actually.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.442
This must be important to you.
I imagine you had to pull

04:44.551 --> 04:46.280
some pretty big strings
to make this happen.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.910
Ferguson got that chunk of metal
in his head

04:48.021 --> 04:50.114
saving my sorry ass four years ago.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.158
-I'll do what I can.
-Thanks.

04:57.397 --> 05:03.029
And so, upon further reflection,
I have come to agree with Ka'lel.

05:03.536 --> 05:08.872
More debate over the proposed state
of government is required.

05:08.975 --> 05:13.036
We must take our time
in such grave matters.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.774
For now, we must maintain
the present High Council

05:15.882 --> 05:20.319
and not bow to the pressure
of brothers Bra'tac and Teal'c.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.327
Maz'rai.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.728
I am entitled
to be swayed by reason, Bra'tac.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.033
You were the one who tabled this proposal
for a referendum.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.837
You've always believed democracy
was essential for the future of our nation.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.843
Indeed, that is still the case.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.004
I have merely been convinced
that we should not act in such haste.

05:49.115 --> 05:53.677
Brother, it was you who feared that
Gerak's followers were gathering strength.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.381
That there was a danger
that if we did not dissolve this council,

05:56.489 --> 05:59.424
they could still vote
to support the unilateral submission

05:59.526 --> 06:00.754
to the religion of the Ori.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.853
All our dreams for a free Jaffa nation
would be lost forever.

06:04.964 --> 06:09.492
All I'm saying is that I believe
there is yet more time for healthy debate.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.172
We cannot let this proposal die.

06:15.275 --> 06:18.244
There are still Council members
who remain uncommitted.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.471
Brother U'kin was not in session today.

06:20.647 --> 06:24.549
I will visit him later this evening
after I confer with our allies on Chulak.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.676
And I will see what I can learn here.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.955
If Maz'rai's vote was influenced,
I shall expose it.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.266
Ferguson.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.498
It's about time.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.270
Son of a bitch drags me out here
to get poked and prodded

06:52.378 --> 06:53.538
and turned upside down

06:53.646 --> 06:55.637
and he can't spare a minute
from his big, important job

06:55.748 --> 06:57.238
to visit his dying friend.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.878
It's good to see your bad attitude
hasn't changed much.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.080
What do you expect?
I'm dying, for God's sakes.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.647
-Don't get up, you idiot.
-Oh, jeez, Cam, I'm not gonna break.

07:09.829 --> 07:13.060
-You look like you're feeling good.
-Yeah, doing pretty good

07:13.166 --> 07:15.430
for a guy with a ticking time bomb
in his head.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.901
Oh, why don't we see
what the doctors have to say about that.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.029
Oh, I'm just doing what the flyer says.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.107
It was in the waiting room
of the shrink's office

07:23.209 --> 07:24.938
they sent me to couple of weeks back.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.670
"So, you're gonna bite the big one.
Now what?"

07:27.914 --> 07:30.144
First thing on the list is accept it.
Learn to talk openly about it.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.013
So that's what I'm doing.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.744
Did I mention I'm gonna die?

07:37.924 --> 07:41.883
-Yeah, I think you did.
-Okay.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.089
So, how about you?
How's the big, important, top-secret job?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.394
Still top-secret.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.436
Oh, come on, man, you can tell me.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.930
I'm gonna die, you know.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.064
(WOMAN CHATTERING
ON P.A. SYSTEM)

07:57.443 --> 07:59.172
-No flowers?
-No.

07:59.612 --> 08:04.675
No. Hell, I thought about it,
but decided on this instead.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.746
Oh, yes. Me likey a lotty.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.355
Colonel, Dr. Jackson.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.986
Bra'tac has information
concerning a situation on Dakara.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.388
It is Teal'c.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.660
He left last night
to consult with one of our allies.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.635
He was due back this morning,
but did not return.

08:25.738 --> 08:29.970
-Are you sure he's not just late?
-He missed an important Council session.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.339
There have been unusual goings-on
as of late.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.974
I am here because I no longer know
who I can trust on Dakara.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.510
And I am certain
something is gravely wrong.

09:06.512 --> 09:07.809
(GRUNTING)

09:28.568 --> 09:29.865
(STATIC BUZZING)

09:34.007 --> 09:37.465
-I will divulge nothing.
-That is not my intention.

09:38.645 --> 09:42.376
My purpose is to teach you.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.513
(SHOUTING)

09:51.090 --> 09:54.821
Obviously, this motion to dissolve
the Council in favor of elected officials

09:54.927 --> 09:57.225
has spawned strong opposition.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.426
Many who have reaped benefits
under the current regime

10:00.533 --> 10:03.058
would lose their status
upon passage of the vote.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.661
Anybody in particular you think
would resort to kidnapping and blackmail

10:06.773 --> 10:08.263
to influence the situation?

10:08.374 --> 10:12.674
I used to believe in the honor of many
who have disappointed me of late.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.276
Well, we should probably start
at Teal'c's last known whereabouts.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.680
Let me know if you need
additional personnel.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.844
Colonel Mitchell is taking
some personal time.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.155
Thank you, sir.

10:22.155 --> 10:22.280
Thank you, sir.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.483
Come on, come on.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.626
No, you don't want none of me.
No, you don't.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.159
Oh, now, don't look now.
You better back down.

10:35.401 --> 10:38.393
Die! Yeah! That's what I'm talking...

10:42.342 --> 10:44.936
What the hell was that?
Are you even trying?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.139
You know what? I'm just...
I'm kind of tired.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.773
But this, this was great, really.
This was just like old times.

10:50.883 --> 10:55.183
I tell you what,
I'll play left-handed with one eye.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.755
Yeah, I'm done.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.156
All right, fine.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.490
-I reserve the right for a rematch.
-Fair enough.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.128
Look, I appreciate
you taking some time, but...

11:09.502 --> 11:10.992
What you talking about?

11:11.604 --> 11:14.129
I'm just saying you did your duty.
You can go now.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.803
I got nowhere else to be.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.303
Really.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.676
Seriously, Cam, it's fine.
You don't have to stick around.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.543
Yes,

11:27.019 --> 11:28.350
I do.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.090
I wish I could be of more help, Bra'tac,

11:34.193 --> 11:37.287
but Teal'c left last night
barely an hour after arriving.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.088
Did he say where he was going?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.526
He said he was needed back on Dakara.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.302
-Was anybody with him?
-He traveled alone.

11:44.404 --> 11:48.135
Please let me know as soon as
you have learned what has happened.

11:52.111 --> 11:56.047
-What is the matter, brother?
-You call yourself a friend,

11:56.449 --> 11:59.247
yet you speak lies to my face!

11:59.585 --> 12:01.052
JACKSON: Whoa, Bra'tac!

12:01.154 --> 12:04.214
He is deceiving us. Where is Teal'c?

12:04.323 --> 12:06.791
Bra'tac, what has come over you?
I have told you what I know.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.919
I will not ask again.

12:10.329 --> 12:11.455
(CHOKING)

12:12.799 --> 12:15.734
He was taken from here.
I do not know where.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.897
Please!

12:21.574 --> 12:22.734
(GASPING)

12:26.579 --> 12:30.037
-What was that all about?
-I believe he speaks the truth.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.014
He does not know where Teal'c is.

12:32.151 --> 12:34.415
But he admitted he helped arrange
for Teal'c's kidnapping.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.614
And he shall be dealt with accordingly.
Unfortunately for us,

12:37.723 --> 12:40.021
this situation is much worse
than I imagined.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.150
How?

12:41.828 --> 12:45.559
U'kin has always been one
of the strongest supporters of our cause.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.156
A Jaffa whose honor
I never would have doubted.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.900
There is but one possible explanation
for his actions.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.464
I saw it in his eyes.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.439
He's been brainwashed.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.910
You know,

13:01.747 --> 13:04.841
I never did buy
that you went down in a test flight.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.911
Why? That's what happened.

13:08.454 --> 13:13.255
Okay, so you were testing a plane
in a dogfight over Antarctica?

13:14.894 --> 13:16.555
-Dogfight?
-I did some checking.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.028
-I still have friends in intelligence.
-Right.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.396
You think you're getting your hands
on classified information, huh?

13:22.502 --> 13:25.403
Not exactly.
I pieced some things together.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.698
Come on, we were both up for that
big, important, classified position.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.540
I just wanna know what I missed out on
that almost got you killed.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.710
I wish I could tell you. I really do.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.444
No, you don't.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.145
No, you probably feel guilty as hell
that you're doing what you're doing,

13:41.254 --> 13:42.221
while I'm waiting to die.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.017
Read the flyer, man.
It's called survivor's guilt.

13:45.124 --> 13:48.491
Now, it also says that you need to be
honest with yourself,

13:48.594 --> 13:50.289
and those around you.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.161
(MEN CHATTERING)

14:05.545 --> 14:08.514
-Speak.
-lt does not seem to be working.

14:09.615 --> 14:12.709
As I feared. His will is strong.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.716
I will break him. Whatever it takes.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.882
No, no. I'll deal with this.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.854
Hello, Teal'c.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.266
You.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.196
Seems it's time we had a little chat.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.874
I've recalled Colonel Carter and SG-3
from Chulak.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.211
Do we have any idea how widespread
this brainwashing might be?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.909
It is impossible to tell.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.312
But it explains how many alliances
have shifted so dramatically

14:49.422 --> 14:50.980
over the course of the last three weeks.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.718
For all we know, half the High Council
may have been compromised.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.556
You believe Goa'uld technology
is behind this?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.258
Teal'c once fell prey to it
at the hands of Apophis.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.960
But he was able to break its hold
by enduring the Rite of M'al Sharran.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.731
Anyone, including a Jaffa could have
their hands on that technology now.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.864
Still, the fact that Teal'c overcame
such manipulation in the past

15:08.975 --> 15:11.876
should make him more able to resist
its effects again.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.106
Which may actually put his life
at greater risk.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.143
Bra'tac, you said
a close friend of yours, Maz'rai,

15:18.250 --> 15:20.844
had a similar change of opinion
virtually overnight.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.820
Yes, it is likely he, too, is brainwashed.

15:23.956 --> 15:27.289
Right, I guess what I'm getting at is,
is it possible you can get him

15:27.393 --> 15:30.021
to defeat the brainwashing
the same way Teal'c did?

15:31.664 --> 15:35.498
And if so, at the very least,
he might be able to give us an idea

15:35.601 --> 15:37.000
as to who is behind this.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.807
I admit we've certainly had
our differences in the past.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.133
But you need to hear what I have to say.

15:45.244 --> 15:48.042
I will not hear the words of a false god.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.272
(CHUCKLES)

15:49.382 --> 15:52.374
Ah, yes, the whole "god" issue.

15:53.519 --> 15:57.285
Maybe we did take it a little too far,
but can you blame us?

15:57.923 --> 16:02.087
We gave you strength, vitality, long life.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.620
I know you don't quite see it that way,
but no matter.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.460
It's all in the past now.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.098
(LAUGHING)

16:15.207 --> 16:16.606
Come now, Teal'c,

16:16.709 --> 16:20.372
we're smart enough to know
we're not actually gods.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.276
Well, some of us are anyway.

16:22.381 --> 16:26.283
There are always those who'll begin
to believe their own propaganda.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.517
I suppose all you need is enough people
to worship you

16:29.622 --> 16:30.884
and then what's the difference?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.618
You're pretty much a god by definition,
are you not?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.262
So is the case with the Ori.

16:37.430 --> 16:41.628
Granted they do seem to have some very
interesting powers to back up their claims.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.361
I've seen what happens
to those who resist.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.561
They are a formidable enemy.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.374
How does this concern you and l?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.875
We worked together
to defeat the Replicators.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.709
This is working together?
Taking me against my will,

16:57.149 --> 16:59.208
brainwashing the Council
to do your bidding?

16:59.318 --> 17:02.947
The Jaffa number in the millions,
spread across the vastness of the galaxy.

17:03.389 --> 17:07.723
Your backgrounds are diverse and rich
in a history of warfare with each other.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.158
Because of the Goa'uld.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.025
As a united nation you are young
and inexperienced.

17:12.131 --> 17:15.191
Too weak to face an adversary
as powerful as the Ori.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.663
Gerak proved that.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.737
What you need right now
is a strong leader.

17:18.838 --> 17:22.672
One with the mind and experience
to wage war on such a foe.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.869
You?

17:26.912 --> 17:31.372
I'm not asking you to worship me.
I do not plan to undermine your freedom.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.851
I care nothing for your rights
and traditions

17:34.954 --> 17:37.286
or what you wish to do
with your daily lives.

17:37.523 --> 17:40.287
What I do not want to see happen
is the utter subjugation

17:40.392 --> 17:42.519
of this entire galaxy
at the hands of the Ori.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.756
That would be an utter shame for all of us.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.991
Don't make this personal, Teal'c.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.695
Your people are in need
and I can help them.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.433
I can help all of us defend ourselves
against the Ori.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.310
MAZ'RAl: That is an absurd accusation!

18:01.947 --> 18:03.505
You know me, Bra'tac.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.713
-I choose my opinions carefully.
-JACKSON: That's true.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.419
No, really, it is.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.920
We checked these out of the hall
of records before coming here.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.351
Six months ago
you co-authored policy measures

18:14.460 --> 18:17.520
designed to prevent voting abuses
by Gerak's coalition.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.231
Four months ago, you voted in favor
of increasing the size of Council

18:21.333 --> 18:23.528
to give unrepresented Jaffa a voice,

18:24.069 --> 18:26.060
and just three weeks ago,
you introduced a motion

18:26.172 --> 18:28.140
to set limits on
the council's legislative power.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.901
Are we seeing a pattern here?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.742
You believe in democracy, Maz'rai.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.482
-How else do you explain your actions?
-I do not deny my beliefs.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.881
-How else do you explain your actions?
-I do not deny my beliefs.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.451
My thinking on the proper timing
and strategy

18:40.553 --> 18:42.885
for implementation is what's changed.

18:42.988 --> 18:46.480
Two evenings ago,
do you remember clearly what you did?

18:46.592 --> 18:49.652
Bra'tac, I do not remember
what I ate yesterday.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.659
That is sad, I admit,
but proof of nothing other than old age.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.497
"Age has taken away everything
but our wisdom, old friend."

18:57.837 --> 18:59.771
Those were your words to me

19:00.072 --> 19:03.200
just before you tabled
the referendum for democracy.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.572
Tell me one thing
that happened the night before last

19:05.678 --> 19:07.646
and I will let this rest.

19:07.746 --> 19:08.838
(SCOFFS)

19:23.829 --> 19:24.955
Please leave me.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.958
I am weary.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.709
JACKSON: Bra'tac.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.719
We have reached him. Trust me.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.314
Facing the Rite of M'al Sharran
is something one must do

19:54.426 --> 19:56.758
with clear mind and conviction.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.924
We must give him time.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.533
WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
Dr. Peterson to Room 5B.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.842
-You know what I think you're doing?
-Sleeping.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.575
I think you're fighting aliens.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.911
I think that chunk of metal
you got in your cranium

20:24.023 --> 20:25.547
has caused a lot of damage.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.752
I know you weren't test flying a plane
down in Antarctica.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.593
You were fighting an alien armada

20:32.698 --> 20:35.166
in human-built, alien-hybrid fighters.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.963
Now, we've got like a whole fleet of them,

20:38.070 --> 20:41.267
and at least a couple
of interstellar battleships.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.575
-Whatever you say, man.
-The info is out there.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.804
And the military, they couldn't build
all that stuff themselves.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.211
They'd have to contract it out.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.949
I did some consulting for
an aeronautics firm called Zephyr,

20:54.053 --> 20:56.988
when I first went on disability.
Come on, man.

20:57.723 --> 21:01.784
Man, I'm seasoned enough to see
through all the bogus cover stories

21:01.894 --> 21:05.421
that have been blowing around
the last couple years. I mean...

21:05.531 --> 21:08.694
What really happened to that building
in Seattle a couple of months back?

21:09.668 --> 21:14.435
And that strange new influenza outbreak
that swept the globe.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.540
Didn't that start in a hospital near here?

21:17.643 --> 21:21.704
-Look, Ferguson...
-No, I know, I know, you can't tell me.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.578
Doesn't really matter. The point is,
I know that whatever you're into, it's big.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.585
I mean,
it's bigger than we ever dreamed of.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.986
Even back when we were cadets
and we swore that blood oath

21:32.091 --> 21:34.958
that we'd make it into
the space program or die trying.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.397
Look, I'm not
some crazy conspiracy nut, Cam.

21:40.265 --> 21:41.391
I know.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.632
You got things to do
besides sitting here waiting for me to die.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.131
Go.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.815
I find it helps if you hit it.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.522
Oh, that's all right. I probably
shouldn't have any more caffeine.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.788
I got the results back from the CAT scan.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.933
-And?
-Well, it pretty much confirmed

22:16.035 --> 22:17.969
Mr. Ferguson's own doctor's findings.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.836
The shrapnel originally lodged itself
against an intracranial artery,

22:21.940 --> 22:25.103
and over the course of the next few years,
formed the aneurysm.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.008
Given its size and relative position,

22:28.113 --> 22:30.877
we risk doing more damage
if we attack it surgically.

22:30.983 --> 22:34.680
Even an intravascular approach
would likely cause a major rupture.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.912
Okay. So, what's the plan?

22:38.457 --> 22:41.858
Well, I know you were hoping
for better news, Colonel. I'm sorry.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.325
I'm afraid there are no options.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.823
It's only a matter of time.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.973
Sorry, doc, you were wrong.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.010
Hitting it doesn't help.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.210
I'll pay for that.

23:20.599 --> 23:21.793
Thank you.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.401
Now, please leave us.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.046
You think he did this to himself?

23:36.849 --> 23:38.908
He removed his own symbiote.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.945
The Rite of M'al Sharran.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.847
I don't understand.
Why would he do this on his own?

23:44.957 --> 23:47.289
I mean, he had to know
how dangerous it would be.

23:47.392 --> 23:48.723
Indeed.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.795
It requires that you bring yourself
to the edge of death

23:52.097 --> 23:54.588
in order to find your own true spirit.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.360
Should you fail...

23:56.502 --> 23:58.902
He was ashamed
that he'd been brainwashed.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.465
If he failed to overcome it,
he didn't want anyone here to save him.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.978
I pushed you to this, old friend.

24:13.418 --> 24:14.612
Bra'tac.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.256
Ka'lel.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.526
LANDRY: Bra 'tac is tailing Ka 'Iel.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.133
He's hopeful it will Iead
to Teal'c's whereabouts.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.767
Colonel Carter is putting together
a rescue operation

24:32.871 --> 24:35.237
that we can implement
the moment we get confirmation.

24:35.340 --> 24:36.466
I'll be there.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.839
Under the circumstances,
everyone will understand

24:38.944 --> 24:42.072
-if you choose to stay back on this one.
-I'm sorry, sir,

24:42.781 --> 24:44.544
we're talking about Teal'c.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.517
I understand. How's your friend doing?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.151
Not so good.

24:51.390 --> 24:55.656
On that front, sir,
there's something I need to ask you.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.867
So have you given some thought
to my proposal?

25:07.439 --> 25:12.376
To be honest, you've looked better, Teal'c.
Don't tell me your spirit is waning.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.413
I know you need tretonin to live.

25:20.285 --> 25:24.089
Give in. Don't threaten the future
of your people because of personal pride.

25:24.089 --> 25:24.748
Give in. Don't threaten the future
of your people because of personal pride.

25:25.791 --> 25:29.784
You are frightened.
You seek to control the Jaffa,

25:30.829 --> 25:35.095
because you recognize the power
of the Ori.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.828
And you are helpless

25:37.936 --> 25:41.269
to do anything about it on your own.

25:42.407 --> 25:45.467
I have tried to be nice,
I have tried to present reason,

25:45.577 --> 25:48.307
convince you in a most merciful fashion,

25:48.547 --> 25:50.538
but my patience wears thin.

25:51.183 --> 25:55.279
Rest assured, I will prevail over your
precious Council and control the Jaffa.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.287
Ultimately, it is for their own good.

25:58.023 --> 26:02.892
If you keep resisting me
I will have no choice but to let you die.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.836
-Cameron.
-Sam.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.468
Bra'tac got us a gate address.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.806
Ka'lel lead him to a planet
with a mother ship parked on a pyramid.

26:23.915 --> 26:27.316
-He believes Teal'c's being held there.
-That's good news.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.520
-We're briefing in an hour.
-I'll be there.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.515
-Do you need some help with this?
-No, I got it.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.293
Does this make me a hypocrite?

26:39.331 --> 26:43.199
-I told my dad.
-He was getting a Tok'ra symbiote.

26:43.535 --> 26:48.063
-Pete?
-Got shot by a Goa'uld with a laser blaster.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.334
That's not really the point.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.006
I'm talking about using that thing.

26:53.712 --> 26:57.341
You know, after what happened to me
I was opposed to anyone

26:57.449 --> 26:59.644
ever having anything to do
with that technology.

26:59.751 --> 27:02.117
Now I'm going out of my way
to make use of it.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.453
Is showing your friend the truth
gonna make him feel any better?

27:07.559 --> 27:10.926
He wants to know
I'm not gonna be burdened with guilt

27:11.029 --> 27:13.156
over the fact that he died because of me.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.993
The truth gonna change that?

27:19.204 --> 27:20.535
Not for me.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.577
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.244
So, you're finally
getting the hell out of here?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.407
-Actually, yes.
-Good.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.046
I might not be here
when you get back, though.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.586
Don't you quit on me.

27:36.788 --> 27:40.246
No, I just meant that I'm checking out
of the hospital.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.326
I'm going home. There's nothing more
they can do for me here.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.529
What is that?

27:46.198 --> 27:48.723
It's a little something I picked up
on another planet.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.095
That's very good. That's hilarious.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.535
You know, you never really
could tell a joke.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.837
We've made some modifications
since we got our hands on this,

27:57.943 --> 28:00.343
but basically, here's how it works.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.777
Some of my memories from the last year
have been downloaded into this device.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.244
Attach these leads to your head

28:08.820 --> 28:11.448
and you get to experience
some of the things I've gone through.

28:13.091 --> 28:16.117
-You're serious?
-You wanted to know the truth.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.387
I'm gonna show it to you.

28:25.003 --> 28:27.904
You can continue to resist me and die,

28:28.840 --> 28:31.968
or you can take the tretonin
and save yourself.

28:32.077 --> 28:35.012
Join me and you will save many more.

a Iittle problem in here!

No, can 't say that I ha ve.

MITCHELL: A hologram?

29:01.773 --> 29:04.503
And we do not want to get into a God-off.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.782
Teal'c is in trouble.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.451
There's a rescue op about to leave.
I have to go.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.253
Go save him, for God's sakes.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.893
Yeah. I just don't want you to give up,

29:23.995 --> 29:25.826
not when there's so many
possibilities out there.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.455
Just get out of here.

29:27.566 --> 29:31.502
Look, before I go, I have to say something.
You may not like it,

29:31.670 --> 29:34.730
but I'm gonna have to live with it
no matter what you say or do.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.037
I'm sorry.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.076
I'm doing what I'm doing and you're not,

29:41.012 --> 29:43.776
because I acted rashly.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.977
I'm a hothead and
you're suffering because of it.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.418
No, you're doing what you're doing
because of who you are.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.717
Yeah, I'm impatient. I lose control.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.621
I'm not particularly fond
of that side of myself.

29:54.726 --> 29:58.025
I didn't mean that.
When you see an opportunity, you take it.

The kind of things that you and me
were asked to do, that you're doing now,

30:01.299 --> 30:05.099
I mean, you gotta be a little angry.
You gotta be out of control.

30:05.203 --> 30:07.967
I mean, you think too much,
you're just gonna freeze up.

30:08.073 --> 30:12.203
My God, you are going to other planets
through a freaking wormhole.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.436
You have to be a little nuts.

-I just don't wanna screw up again.
-Well, you better not.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.244
This Teal'c, he seems like
a pretty decent guy,

30:22.220 --> 30:23.778

-Jaffa.
-Jaffa.

Trust me, that's pretty damn good.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.457
Thanks.

30:39.704 --> 30:42.229
I would have done it for anyone,
you know that.

but limited resistance

31:47.739 --> 31:49.400

It will be visible roughly half a mile
from the gate.

aerial cover.

31:56.948 --> 31:59.382
-Thank you for joining us, Colonel.
-Sir.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.918
We will secure the gate,
proceed to the pyramid,

32:09.027 --> 32:11.860
gain access to the mother ship,
and locate and retrieve Teal'c.

32:11.963 --> 32:14.625
Keep in mind all evidence suggests
Teal'c's been brainwashed.

There's no guarantee he's even gonna
cooperate with this rescue.
