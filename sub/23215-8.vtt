WEBVTT

00:02.387 --> 00:04.300
- <i>Ease the pressure.</i>
- Ease the pressure.

00:04.338 --> 00:07.346
Nice. Very nice. Not bad.

00:07.444 --> 00:10.142
Learning calligraphy?
It's a useful skill.

00:10.167 --> 00:11.847
I need you to write a
strongly worded letter

00:11.872 --> 00:13.172
to Thomas Jefferson, please.

00:13.197 --> 00:15.315
Benji, no, I'm actually finishing up

00:15.340 --> 00:17.942
the name tags for
my all-girl sleepover weekend.

00:17.967 --> 00:21.389
Come on. You're not a
group-of-friends type of gal, okay?

00:21.414 --> 00:23.502
I've seen how you thrive,
and it's when you find

00:23.527 --> 00:25.007
the weakest one in the herd and poach.

00:25.032 --> 00:26.865
Look, this is different.
Last year, I met

00:26.890 --> 00:28.642
these girls at Lizzy's
bachelorette weekend,

00:28.667 --> 00:31.059
and we just clicked,
there was something there.

00:31.084 --> 00:33.448
And I've been waiting the whole
year to invite them over,

00:33.473 --> 00:35.908
and reconnect and secure
my spot in their friend group.

00:35.933 --> 00:37.319
And you're all going out on the town

00:37.344 --> 00:39.572
while their kids stay here
and play with your toys?

00:39.597 --> 00:42.515
Clearly, you've never
been to a girls' sleepover, okay.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.948
We are going to tap into
our inner child,

00:45.018 --> 00:46.850
and let loose and get
to know each other.

00:46.875 --> 00:50.804
We've got puffy paints, glitter,
body shimmer, Spice Girls.

00:50.829 --> 00:54.876
Each thing more fun and youthful
and flirty than the last.

00:54.968 --> 00:57.344
Dude, if you put half the energy

00:57.369 --> 00:59.302
you put into getting
random girls to like you

00:59.327 --> 01:00.772
into shaving your happy trail or...

01:00.797 --> 01:01.963
These girls are not random.

01:01.988 --> 01:03.921
Okay, these are Lizzy's best friends,

01:04.004 --> 01:06.113
and Lizzy is our queen and our leader,

01:06.138 --> 01:07.404
and she discovered me, okay?

01:07.486 --> 01:08.991
She's the Cher and I'm the Tai.

01:09.016 --> 01:10.029
That's a <i> Clueless</i> reference.

01:10.054 --> 01:11.120
We're gonna watch the movie tonight.

01:11.144 --> 01:12.502
- Stay in your room.
- What?

01:12.527 --> 01:13.534
You're not allocating my

01:13.559 --> 01:14.725
own house to me. What
are you talking about?

01:14.749 --> 01:17.091
Thank you for abiding by the
rules of the house calendar,

01:17.116 --> 01:19.242
- as we previously agreed upon.
- I never agreed to anything.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.636
- This is stupid.
- I'm gonna email to confirm,

01:20.660 --> 01:22.315
- 'CC' myself.
- NO!

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.228 --> 01:38.195
Uh, what is happening?

01:41.062 --> 01:43.746
Excuse me, this is a closed,
private dance rehearsal.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.717
- Can I help you?
- You don't have the ankle strength

01:45.742 --> 01:48.159
to just dance like that
without stretching first.

01:48.184 --> 01:50.427
I know I joke and say
you have cankles, but...

01:50.864 --> 01:52.882
- you're frail.
- I don't need to stretch,

01:52.907 --> 01:55.485
because my body
knows this routine by heart

01:55.510 --> 01:57.343
since the fifth grade talent show.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.997
And tonight, I'm teaching it
to all my girlfriends

02:00.022 --> 02:02.256
who are coming over,
so no interruptions.

02:02.281 --> 02:04.348
I've got plans tonight,
so don't worry about it.

02:04.459 --> 02:07.602
You don't bother us. Yeah, I said us.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.494
My ex Caitlyn's in town for a few days.

02:09.519 --> 02:10.592
You can't call someone your ex

02:10.616 --> 02:12.521
just because you really
wanted to kiss them

02:12.546 --> 02:14.791
- at summer camp.
- You didn't see our chemistry, alright.

02:14.816 --> 02:16.370
Summer camp love is really intense.

02:16.395 --> 02:17.477
You don't understand that

02:17.502 --> 02:19.127
'cause you have mom-dad
separation anxiety.

02:19.152 --> 02:21.460
I had my own childhood
summer fling, okay?

02:21.485 --> 02:23.573
Matt the husky lifeguard
in the publipoc pool

02:23.598 --> 02:27.032
always gave me free drumsticks,
chicken and ice cream.

02:27.057 --> 02:29.525
Sounds like a bad lifeguard; he's
husky, and giving people food

02:29.550 --> 02:30.823
while they're swimming. Double no-no.

02:30.847 --> 02:33.161
It's really hard to reconnect
with people from the past

02:33.186 --> 02:34.219
Do you have a plan?

02:34.244 --> 02:35.450
Tell her how I felt back then,

02:35.475 --> 02:36.991
and then maybe, she'll like me now?

02:37.016 --> 02:40.470
Communicate your feelings?
You don't have that skill set.

02:40.495 --> 02:42.871
I guess not, but I got really
high quality psychedelics,

02:42.896 --> 02:44.896
and I'm hoping that'll loosen me up.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.539
I saw on her Snapchat that

02:46.570 --> 02:48.385
she goes to a lot of
jam band concerts, so.

02:48.442 --> 02:50.099
Oh, my God, Benji!

02:50.124 --> 02:51.467
She likes 11-minute songs.

02:51.492 --> 02:53.180
I figure I'm not as bad as that.

02:53.205 --> 02:55.771
Don't you know that 90% of
the people who try drugs

02:55.796 --> 02:58.133
- will eventually die?
- We're just gonna micro-dose.

02:58.158 --> 03:01.260
It's nothing, it's like
a strong antidepressant.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.216
Benji, I'm trying to
save your life, okay?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.727
I'm sorry, there's this baby duck video

03:06.752 --> 03:08.557
that this girl put on
her Instagram story.

03:08.582 --> 03:10.090
It's so cute.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.080
Wait, I wanna see the baby duck.

03:12.105 --> 03:13.687
Show me the baby duck video.

03:22.155 --> 03:25.869
Hey, guys, welcome. I made T-shirts.

03:25.894 --> 03:27.835
I hope you guys like everything, oh,

03:27.866 --> 03:29.108
Jess!

03:29.707 --> 03:31.830
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

03:31.867 --> 03:35.507
I am so happy you're here.
Oh, here's your shirt.

03:35.702 --> 03:38.393
Oh, cool. Thank you.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.843
Yeah. Um, I saw you passed the bar.

03:40.868 --> 03:42.503
I'm so proud of you.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.844
How do you know that?

03:44.869 --> 03:46.366
I just found out last night.

03:46.391 --> 03:48.366
Oh, well, that
information's all public.

03:48.515 --> 03:51.264
I took a course in college
on investigative journalism.

03:51.391 --> 03:53.358
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.634
- You look really pretty.
- Oh, thanks. So do you.

03:55.659 --> 03:56.934
- Thanks.
- This is really fun.

03:56.959 --> 03:59.226
Thank you. Cammy!

04:00.120 --> 04:01.379
Here's your shirt.

04:01.404 --> 04:03.812
- Aw.
- How's the singing career going?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.265
Did you get an agent yet?

04:05.365 --> 04:07.280
I'm an accountant.

04:07.305 --> 04:08.954
Oh, I know. I just meant at
Lizzy's bachelorette weekend,

04:08.978 --> 04:10.832
you sang "Like A Virgin,"
and it was so good,

04:10.857 --> 04:13.825
it was like I was hearing the
song for the very first time.

04:14.007 --> 04:16.858
I was like a virgin
to the... forget it.

04:16.884 --> 04:19.401
You're probably so swamped
with tax season approaching.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.659
No, it just ended.

04:20.701 --> 04:23.568
Well, you know what they say.
It's always tax season somewhere.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.572
Yeah. I brought you this.

04:26.597 --> 04:28.254
Ooh, let's open that up.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.669
- Yes!
- Yeah.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.513
Actually, um...

04:32.538 --> 04:35.471
Actually, I was thinking
we would do a sober weekend,

04:35.496 --> 04:37.546
just 'cause it's usually
more fun that way.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.579
Um, I made stevia lemonade.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.925
So there's no drinking this weekend?

04:42.969 --> 04:44.291
I just want to avoid that thing

04:44.316 --> 04:46.356
where you feel like you made
a super strong connection,

04:46.381 --> 04:47.747
and the next day, people are, like,

04:47.772 --> 04:49.692
"That didn't mean anything,
we were drunk."

04:49.976 --> 04:51.638
I think we're all on the same page.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.388
Wait, who are we missing?

04:53.453 --> 04:55.286
Um, can someone text Lizzy?

04:55.342 --> 04:57.292
She never responded to my evite,

04:57.317 --> 04:58.583
but I'm sure she'll show up.

04:58.819 --> 05:01.620
I don't have her number,
we're more email pals.

05:02.082 --> 05:04.363
Esther, is that, like,
a messed-up joke or something?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.177
Why? Is it funny?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.322
Lizzy's dead.

05:10.704 --> 05:12.404
As if.

05:12.886 --> 05:15.319
No, I'm not kidding.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.108
She's gone.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.608
Excuse me.

05:18.632 --> 05:20.187
It was about eight months ago.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.000
No one told you?

05:24.091 --> 05:25.867
No. I know.

05:27.107 --> 05:28.416
I know.

05:28.482 --> 05:30.795
And that's why I have
brought you all here,

05:30.820 --> 05:33.534
is to have a celebration of her life.

05:33.705 --> 05:34.827
I don't get it.

05:34.852 --> 05:36.832
Well, these are all the things
that Lizzy loved.

05:36.857 --> 05:38.893
She loved puffy paints,

05:39.073 --> 05:41.073
and pipe cleaners,

05:41.402 --> 05:43.703
and loose feathers.

05:44.751 --> 05:46.382
You know, we should do a toast.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.684
To Lizzy.

05:47.709 --> 05:49.771
- Yes...
- That would be really nice.

05:49.796 --> 05:51.579
Uh, but no alcohol, remember,

05:51.604 --> 05:54.471
so maybe, like,
a stevia lemonade toast.

05:54.741 --> 05:55.972
Okay.

05:56.469 --> 05:58.436
This way, Caitlyn.

05:58.671 --> 06:01.421
So I was thinking we could
get the night started

06:01.446 --> 06:05.114
with a little nostalgic camp activity.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.769
Tetherball!

06:07.875 --> 06:10.354
Oh, man, I used to crush you at this.

06:10.418 --> 06:12.318
Got it at a pre-school foreclosure.

06:12.386 --> 06:15.022
That's sad, but I'm
still gonna beat you.

06:15.068 --> 06:16.295
Oh, yeah?

06:16.324 --> 06:18.424
Let's see how good either of
us are after we eat this.

06:18.531 --> 06:20.354
Oh, drugs.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.073
I'm actually a very
holistic person now.

06:23.203 --> 06:25.232
Well, that's fine. This is
actually a plant derivative.

06:25.257 --> 06:27.972
In Peru, this is
considered a super fruit.

06:28.168 --> 06:30.231
Sorry, I don't do drugs anymore.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.337
You don't? How long have
you been sober for?

06:32.375 --> 06:33.810
- Two days.
- Well.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.122
That's a thing, you know.

06:35.147 --> 06:36.793
It's pretty tough when your sponsors

06:36.818 --> 06:39.008
are trying to sleep
with you all the time.

06:39.119 --> 06:42.236
Yeah, if you can't trust a drug
addict, who can you trust?

06:43.209 --> 06:44.476
Well, uh...

06:44.531 --> 06:46.149
my serve.

06:48.435 --> 06:50.422
My plan was to do this on drugs.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.062
I'm doing it sober
like Napoleon Dynamite.

06:53.087 --> 06:54.702
Well... you're not even trying.

06:54.727 --> 06:56.560
Hit it hard. Have some pride.

06:58.037 --> 07:00.273
Okay. Challenge accepted.

07:00.407 --> 07:02.607
Benji.

07:03.143 --> 07:04.943
Oh, my God, are you okay?

07:04.968 --> 07:07.157
Yeah, I'm fine. The ball's pretty soft.

07:07.182 --> 07:08.617
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

07:08.642 --> 07:09.741
I did not mean to interrupt you.

07:09.766 --> 07:11.999
Benji, I really need to
talk to you inside immediately.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.625
I'm fine. Go.

07:13.707 --> 07:15.233
Just wait right there.
I'll be right back.

07:15.258 --> 07:16.857
We'll make up for lost time, and...

07:16.911 --> 07:19.343
and, um, I've got so many
fun surprises, all right?

07:19.447 --> 07:20.829
I'll be right back.

07:22.528 --> 07:24.858
I'm confused. You threw a
party for a dead person?

07:24.883 --> 07:25.918
Not on purpose.

07:25.943 --> 07:28.477
Was Lizzy that paralegal
who got you diplomatic immunity

07:28.502 --> 07:30.268
- to park in loading zones?
- No, that was Christina.

07:30.304 --> 07:32.037
Lizzy was my manager at the juice bar,

07:32.062 --> 07:33.382
the one who had to let me go because

07:33.407 --> 07:34.923
she knew I was meant for bigger things.

07:34.948 --> 07:36.395
Right, you stole a few hundred dollars

07:36.420 --> 07:37.447
in charcoal lemonade, right?

07:37.472 --> 07:39.171
And because she believed in me.

07:39.605 --> 07:40.898
Now there's a group of girls out there

07:40.923 --> 07:43.223
with no leader, there's a
shirt with nobody to wear it.

07:43.248 --> 07:44.644
I mean, it's a war zone.

07:44.669 --> 07:46.650
We've already lost one of our own.

07:46.693 --> 07:49.890
Okay, yeah, this sounds dramatic.
A female power vacuum.

07:49.929 --> 07:52.657
- I don't know what to tell you.
- Oh, my God... you're right.

07:52.682 --> 07:55.517
It's a power vacuum.
That is so dangerous.

07:55.864 --> 07:57.976
I mean, that's why me,
Becca, Jamie, and Christina

07:58.001 --> 07:59.330
never made it past the fifth grade,

07:59.355 --> 08:00.675
because we had no leader.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.985
We couldn't decide what to
wear on twin day. True story.

08:04.010 --> 08:05.876
Esther, I love you, but you
just say people's names

08:05.901 --> 08:07.476
like I'm supposed to know
who they are, and I don't.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.033
I have to do something,

08:09.058 --> 08:11.372
for Lizzy's memory, and for my party,

08:11.397 --> 08:13.383
because both are in
very bad shape right now.

08:13.408 --> 08:15.449
Dude, stop with
the structured activities,

08:15.474 --> 08:17.664
and just chill out; that's
what people wanna do.

08:17.723 --> 08:18.871
That's what I'm doing with Caitlyn,

08:18.895 --> 08:19.921
and we're having an awesome time.

08:19.945 --> 08:21.722
Look, I can be happy for
you and Caitlyn later,

08:21.747 --> 08:23.945
but right now, there is
a group of girls out there

08:23.970 --> 08:26.037
that needs me to be their leader.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.430
- Their Cher Horowitz.
- All right. Good luck.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.689
Wow.

08:32.943 --> 08:35.056
I mean, I am about to be in charge

08:35.096 --> 08:36.864
of a group of six young women

08:36.889 --> 08:38.645
for the rest of our lives,

08:38.780 --> 08:41.688
through the ups and downs of career,

08:41.726 --> 08:44.392
marriage, children,
divorce, our husbands dying.

08:44.417 --> 08:45.649
I mean, it's gonna be a challenge,

08:45.674 --> 08:47.374
but I'm up for it.

08:52.286 --> 08:53.437
Wish me luck.

08:53.465 --> 08:54.999
I just wished you luck ten seconds ago.

08:55.024 --> 08:57.065
You don't listen to anything I say.

09:00.079 --> 09:02.780
Sorry about my wacky friend.

09:03.655 --> 09:05.816
What's going on?

09:06.356 --> 09:07.623
I have a headache,

09:07.648 --> 09:11.083
so I'm using crystal therapy
to open my energy pathways.

09:11.263 --> 09:12.832
Girl, you got rocks on your face.

09:12.857 --> 09:14.318
I think you have a concussion.

09:14.413 --> 09:15.825
Let's go to the hospital.

09:16.001 --> 09:17.233
No way.

09:17.343 --> 09:19.370
So western medicine can pump me

09:19.395 --> 09:21.091
full of cancer-causing agents?

09:21.116 --> 09:22.199
I don't think so.

09:22.244 --> 09:23.676
Do you have oregano oil?

09:23.701 --> 09:25.913
It works way better than aspirin.

09:25.938 --> 09:27.412
Oregano? Um...

09:27.446 --> 09:29.140
My brother dates a lot of crazy girls,

09:29.165 --> 09:31.307
and he has this drawer full
of stuff; I can check there.

09:31.436 --> 09:32.781
You think I'm crazy?

09:32.945 --> 09:35.387
I think you're crazy hot.

09:35.481 --> 09:36.714
I'll be right back.

09:37.055 --> 09:38.929
- How can she not...
- Lizzy hated crafts.

09:39.011 --> 09:42.197
Okay, ladies, gather round. Perfect.

09:42.468 --> 09:44.010
Wait, what happened to Marissa?

09:44.216 --> 09:45.980
Oh, Marissa had to go,

09:46.044 --> 09:49.613
and there was a phone call
in Thailand for work, so...

09:49.638 --> 09:52.367
Global citizen.
SO worldly, I love that.

09:52.545 --> 09:53.814
Okay, for the rest of us,

09:53.839 --> 09:55.873
let's get to crafts circuits, right?

09:56.141 --> 09:58.503
Jess, let's start you
at the tie dye station,

09:58.590 --> 10:01.624
and Cammy, calligraphy. Be careful,
those M's are super tricky.

10:01.980 --> 10:03.737
Sophia, sticker books.

10:03.782 --> 10:05.424
When you guys hear
the bell, we'll rotate.

10:05.449 --> 10:07.561
I am gonna start making my candy salad.

10:07.586 --> 10:09.586
It's a super secret family recipe.

10:09.611 --> 10:13.446
My grandmother actually
immigrated from Candyland, so...

10:16.055 --> 10:17.746
Good times.

10:17.849 --> 10:19.682
I'll see ya in there.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.636
Okay, I'm gonna call a Lyft.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.491
I wanna get in there.

10:23.516 --> 10:25.229
- Let me get my shoes.
- Should have gone with Marissa.

10:25.253 --> 10:26.748
Why didn't I get a ride with her?

10:26.773 --> 10:28.661
Whoa, whoa, where are you guys going?

10:28.686 --> 10:30.651
You look like a Lyft driver.
Can you get us out of here?

10:30.676 --> 10:33.565
We're leaving, it's
just all kids' stuff.

10:33.598 --> 10:34.792
Plus there's no booze.

10:34.817 --> 10:36.118
You can't just leave.

10:36.143 --> 10:38.083
Tonight means a lot to Esther.
Look around.

10:38.108 --> 10:40.829
I mean, it's sweet that you
care about her, but...

10:41.710 --> 10:44.129
I mean, I have to care about her.
She's like a rescue animal.

10:44.154 --> 10:46.022
If you're not nice to them
and pet them and feed them,

10:46.047 --> 10:48.814
they pee on the floor
and bite you, you know.

10:48.975 --> 10:51.305
But, I don't know, maybe
tonight will get better.

10:51.330 --> 10:54.151
It's time to rotate.

10:54.213 --> 10:55.760
- Okay...
- Bye.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.158
Wait, wait, wait.

10:57.183 --> 10:59.383
Uh, here, take this.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.829
You'll have a lot
of fun with this stuff.

11:00.919 --> 11:02.770
- Oh...
- What is it?

11:02.795 --> 11:05.112
I think it's like a "let's
massage each other" type drug,

11:05.137 --> 11:06.616
but I'm not really familiar.

11:06.641 --> 11:07.828
I was just trying to impress a girl

11:07.853 --> 11:09.175
who likes jam bands, to be honest.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.686
- Who's in?
- Me.

11:10.809 --> 11:12.273
I don't do drugs that often,

11:12.298 --> 11:14.465
but I think, if you wanna do
drugs, you wanna do that stuff.

11:14.490 --> 11:16.411
Secret's safe with us. Sh!

11:16.451 --> 11:18.249
Who's Asif, by the way?

11:23.067 --> 11:24.934
Oh, my God.

11:24.959 --> 11:27.354
I love this candy piano.

11:27.379 --> 11:29.754
It's so freakin' cute.

11:29.779 --> 11:32.013
And you did
such a great job building it.

11:32.038 --> 11:34.473
Honestly, someone should
give you a break.

11:36.536 --> 11:38.603
Yes, yes.

11:38.717 --> 11:42.216
Oh, my God, you wrote
"calligraphy" in calligraphy?

11:42.241 --> 11:43.982
- That's amazing.
- Thanks.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.089
Yes!

11:45.114 --> 11:48.869
Jess, your sticker book page
looks awesome.

11:48.894 --> 11:49.987
It's insane, right?

11:50.012 --> 11:51.659
If I were to give you
any criticism at all,

11:51.684 --> 11:52.851
I'd say it's a little kitten heavy,

11:52.876 --> 11:55.009
but, like, if that's your taste,
go for it.

11:55.034 --> 11:56.901
I just feel like I'm a child again.

11:57.023 --> 11:59.820
Like, but in a really...
like, I'm a child again.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.213
- Yes.
- You know, and I just

12:01.238 --> 12:03.330
have been fighting this
creative part of myself

12:03.355 --> 12:05.880
for too long, and I'm not
going back to who I was before.

12:05.905 --> 12:08.282
This is who I am now.
I honestly owe it to you.

12:08.307 --> 12:11.543
And you're sober, that's what
makes this so much better, right?

12:16.355 --> 12:17.495
Okay, for real, though,

12:17.520 --> 12:20.087
I think it's time for us
to put on our movement clothes,

12:20.112 --> 12:22.112
and get to the dance portion
of the night.

12:22.461 --> 12:24.050
Yeah!

12:24.075 --> 12:25.333
- Whoo!
- Oh.

12:25.358 --> 12:27.209
Oh, my God!

12:27.292 --> 12:30.927
Esther, Esther, Esther!

12:31.229 --> 12:33.830
- Okay, okay.
- Esther!

12:34.947 --> 12:36.814
This is good. What's in it?

12:36.882 --> 12:39.621
Um, some parsley, uh, turmeric,

12:39.772 --> 12:41.281
some dehydrated chicken stock.

12:41.306 --> 12:43.945
I pretty much accessed my inner shaman,

12:44.015 --> 12:47.361
and poured my whole spice
rack into a hot cup of water.

12:47.453 --> 12:49.914
Well, I feel better,
so that's a good sign.

12:50.015 --> 12:51.569
Yeah, I mean, I'm no NFL doctor,

12:51.594 --> 12:53.535
but I don't think
you have a concussion,

12:53.560 --> 12:55.627
so on to our next activity.

12:55.974 --> 12:57.740
I have no idea what to do with you.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.864
While you were gone,
I looked through the window

12:59.889 --> 13:02.457
at the slumber party.
Do you wanna join in?

13:02.548 --> 13:04.610
And, like, make fun of
them, like summer camp.

13:04.650 --> 13:08.471
Sure. Or maybe, they wanna talk
about their energy centers.

13:10.516 --> 13:12.416
I thought you said
you have a college degree.

13:27.279 --> 13:28.780
Everyone's on drugs 'cause of me.

13:28.805 --> 13:30.757
I'm pretty much like
a legit club promoter now.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.682
All I need is one of those
Barbados scarves

13:32.707 --> 13:35.239
that Steven Tyler's mic stand wears.

13:39.651 --> 13:41.415
Oh, yes, you guys, yes.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.274
Oh, my God, really remember
to snap that hip, remember?

13:44.299 --> 13:46.460
Snap. Cassidy, I see you.

13:46.485 --> 13:48.733
I feel seen, I do.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.030
Let's join.

13:51.069 --> 13:53.036
I don't wanna. Come on.

13:53.325 --> 13:55.637
I can't give a bunch of girls
drugs and then have them dance.

13:55.662 --> 13:58.199
That's a little too South Beach for me.

13:58.403 --> 13:59.767
But go dance. I don't
wanna hold you back.

13:59.792 --> 14:00.961
Have fun.

14:01.053 --> 14:02.487
Nice work out there.

14:03.288 --> 14:04.987
That's right.

14:05.157 --> 14:08.554
Now this is leadership in action, okay?

14:08.687 --> 14:09.854
Lean in, bitch.

14:09.879 --> 14:11.313
I'm leaning everywhere.

14:11.377 --> 14:12.887
I can smell you everywhere.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.382
I know your body odor is strong,

14:15.407 --> 14:18.208
but it's not, like,
bad, you know what I mean?

14:18.803 --> 14:20.251
It's body odor, it's bad.

14:20.299 --> 14:22.630
Esther, I love this song.

14:22.655 --> 14:24.911
It was my jam back in the day.

14:24.936 --> 14:27.617
It's my jam still, so...

14:27.727 --> 14:28.912
What is she doing out here?

14:28.937 --> 14:31.284
Having a good time.
This is all positive stuff.

14:31.309 --> 14:33.759
Your slumber party's a hit, you
got a new girl in your squad.

14:33.784 --> 14:36.585
No, no, no. You can't just
throw in a new person.

14:36.735 --> 14:38.635
It ruins the equilibrium, okay.

14:38.951 --> 14:41.004
And I don't wanna
make this about the dance,

14:41.029 --> 14:44.263
but, like, she clearly
doesn't get the tone.

14:48.167 --> 14:49.539
I mean, she's killing it.

14:49.564 --> 14:51.653
Okay, everyone, let's go
back to our respective

14:51.678 --> 14:53.189
sanctions in the house, please.

14:53.265 --> 14:55.360
I think you mean sections,
not sanctions.

14:55.385 --> 14:58.471
Okay, well... sanctions made it sound
more official somehow.

14:58.496 --> 15:00.179
- I think both work.
- Look, Esther,

15:00.204 --> 15:01.382
Caitlyn and I can only connect

15:01.407 --> 15:04.035
in a camp-like setting, and
your party's just like camp.

15:04.109 --> 15:06.257
Everyone's having pre-teen
fun while I stare.

15:06.282 --> 15:09.242
No, you do not get to
shit on my party all night,

15:09.267 --> 15:11.225
and then join in
right when it's peaking.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.888
Like I said, users and
abusers in your room,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.814
and my friends get to stay out here.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.460
If you're talking about me or Caitlyn,

15:17.485 --> 15:19.040
- we didn't do any drugs.
- Well, that's good.

15:19.065 --> 15:20.393
As you see, a drug-free party

15:20.418 --> 15:21.970
is the best kind of party, all right?

15:21.995 --> 15:24.285
Oh, I didn't say nobody took drugs.

15:24.483 --> 15:26.116
Scu me?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.000
What are you talking about?

15:28.159 --> 15:29.262
What?

15:29.287 --> 15:30.836
It was the only way to get them to stay

15:30.861 --> 15:32.120
at your pre-school-themed

15:32.145 --> 15:33.301
- sticker weekend.
- What?

15:33.326 --> 15:36.460
I'm sorry. I gave them
drugs to save your party.

15:36.808 --> 15:38.742
No!

15:47.459 --> 15:48.658
Hey, guys.

15:51.556 --> 15:52.766
Yeah!

15:58.588 --> 16:00.140
Esther!

16:00.224 --> 16:03.225
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

16:04.005 --> 16:05.456
Please, keep your blindfolds on.

16:05.483 --> 16:07.663
You wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.

16:09.005 --> 16:11.330
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't
take my brother's car.

16:11.355 --> 16:12.636
He'll sub-lease my room again.

16:12.661 --> 16:14.168
It's a risk I've gotta take.

16:14.193 --> 16:16.594
These ladies need my help,

16:16.674 --> 16:18.812
and I have to be their leader, okay?

16:18.837 --> 16:20.252
That's just the name of the game.

16:20.277 --> 16:21.723
My ways may be unconventional...

16:21.748 --> 16:24.043
Esther, what are you doing?
Are these girls safe?

16:24.263 --> 16:26.035
Is anyone ever really safe?
Think about it.

16:26.189 --> 16:28.237
Now that sounds fun. Let's go, Benji.

16:28.564 --> 16:30.139
Okay, cool. Me and
Caitlyn will come with.

16:30.272 --> 16:31.662
- No.
- Please.

16:31.687 --> 16:33.364
I've been trying to connect
with this girl all night.

16:33.388 --> 16:36.219
We have nothing in common,
this is, like, my last chance.

16:36.244 --> 16:38.851
Ugh, fine, but only because

16:38.876 --> 16:40.466
you guys could learn
a lot from me tonight,

16:40.491 --> 16:41.993
and I could potentially
save your lives.

16:42.018 --> 16:43.463
Okay, thank you. I owe you.

16:44.181 --> 16:46.122
I know. My office will invoice you.

16:46.596 --> 16:49.325
All right, ladies, let's do this. Whoo!

16:50.193 --> 16:51.886
Right this way, guys.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.834
Last activity of the night.
Follow my voice, please.

16:54.887 --> 16:56.550
Oh, my God, are we at Yogurtland?

16:56.575 --> 16:57.897
Starburst factory.

16:57.922 --> 16:59.950
I feel like I smell strawberry.

17:00.003 --> 17:01.065
I'm cold.

17:01.105 --> 17:02.405
Okay, right about here.

17:02.798 --> 17:04.038
What do you think is gonna happen?

17:04.063 --> 17:05.657
I don't know, but I don't think

17:05.683 --> 17:07.826
anyone tonight is leaving
smarter or better off.

17:07.851 --> 17:10.752
Okay, everyone, remove your blindfolds.

17:13.108 --> 17:15.108
She's gonna kill us. I knew it.

17:15.420 --> 17:18.675
Wait, wait. Is this Lizzy's grave?

17:18.701 --> 17:20.531
What, no. That'd be crazy.

17:20.671 --> 17:22.925
We're at Brittany Murphy's grave.

17:23.554 --> 17:25.638
I can't wait to hear how this
makes sense in her head.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.261
As your new 'Cher'.

17:27.308 --> 17:29.075
Like, from <i> Clueless,</i> your leader,

17:29.766 --> 17:31.918
I brought you guys here
to teach you a lesson, okay,

17:31.943 --> 17:34.733
and who better to help me
teach that lesson

17:34.758 --> 17:38.101
than the real-life Tai,
actress Brittany Murphy,

17:38.248 --> 17:40.047
may she rest in peace.

17:41.251 --> 17:43.356
Her body is really here,
so let's take this seriously,

17:43.381 --> 17:45.904
and be respectful. Ahem.

17:46.384 --> 17:49.471
Brittany Anne Bertolotti
arrived in Hollywood

17:49.496 --> 17:51.109
by way of Atlanta,

17:51.289 --> 17:54.045
nothing more than
a <i> Clueless Girl, Interrupted</i>

17:54.139 --> 17:56.459
- by the fate of stardom.
- Very forced.

17:56.598 --> 17:59.013
She made a couple of stops in <i> Sin City,</i>

17:59.038 --> 18:00.970
and danced on <i> Happy Feet,</i> voice only.

18:01.123 --> 18:04.067
And though we were sad to see
her <i> Drop Dead Gorgeous...</i>

18:04.092 --> 18:06.993
Wait, is this like
a <i> Scared Straight</i> thing?

18:07.018 --> 18:09.248
Yeah, 'cause you know that she
didn't actually die

18:09.273 --> 18:10.765
of a drug overdose?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.313
They did an autopsy, and there's no...

18:12.338 --> 18:14.902
No known cause of death.
Yes, of course, I know that.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.024
Pneumonia, if anything, okay?
I'm one of her biggest fans.

18:18.049 --> 18:19.847
I put charm bracelets on her grave

18:19.872 --> 18:22.127
whenever I feel lonely,
which is quite often.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.186
<i>I'm</i> one of her biggest fans.

18:24.221 --> 18:26.656
Do you even know that
there's a made-for-TV movie

18:26.681 --> 18:28.822
- about her life?
- Yes, I know, unfortunately,

18:28.847 --> 18:30.881
but I'm trying to block it
out of my head because...

18:30.906 --> 18:32.490
It was so poorly cast.

18:32.515 --> 18:35.030
- I know. I agree.
- I agree.

18:35.077 --> 18:36.240
This is crazy. We're out of here.

18:36.265 --> 18:37.311
Where are you guys going?

18:37.336 --> 18:38.505
It's not over. There's more.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.761
Yeah, we're gonna get
a Lyft to go to Yogurtland.

18:40.788 --> 18:43.047
Okay, I practiced
this monologue for a long time.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.406
How lame is it that you talk
down to us like we're kids?

18:45.473 --> 18:46.611
Yogurtland!

18:52.150 --> 18:53.876
You've really seen all those movies?

18:54.003 --> 18:55.764
Yeah, of course.
Have you seen <i> Uptown Girls?</i>

18:55.789 --> 18:56.802
Yes, it's my favorite.

18:56.827 --> 18:58.580
- Let's watch it tonight.
- Oh, my God, yeah.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.571
Then we'll watch it after
with audio commentary.

19:02.587 --> 19:05.283
Well, at least someone
found their soulmate tonight.

19:05.389 --> 19:06.462
I'm gonna head to Yogurtland.

19:06.569 --> 19:08.757
- Get me something at Yogurtland.
- Absolutely not.

19:08.782 --> 19:10.008
Yeah, premium toppings.

19:10.033 --> 19:12.243
Okay so you know what's so crazy?

19:12.268 --> 19:14.969
I feel like nobody I know
has seen <i> Little Black Book.</i>

19:15.039 --> 19:17.420
Biggest performance
of a storied career.

19:17.445 --> 19:19.795
Yes, thank you.
You know, Benji usually has

19:19.820 --> 19:22.708
the weirdest friends, but you're,
like, so normal and cool.

19:22.733 --> 19:25.557
- You are normal and cool.
- No one said that to me before.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.829
Wait, should we go take selfies
with Brittany's grave?

19:27.860 --> 19:29.126
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

19:35.983 --> 19:38.300
Hey. Where is everybody?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.785
I have another monologue.

19:39.813 --> 19:41.656
This one has a few prompts.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.980
It's gonna take me
a couple of minutes to set up.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.617
Are they in the bathroom?

19:45.642 --> 19:47.852
It's a whole thing.
We took separate Lyfts,

19:47.925 --> 19:49.481
they went to the yogurt
place on Magnolia.

19:49.517 --> 19:51.737
I mean, drugs will make you
do terrible things.

19:51.809 --> 19:53.285
Damn it.

19:53.504 --> 19:55.554
Do you wanna hear my monologue?

19:55.767 --> 19:57.955
- Definitely no.
- Great.

19:58.045 --> 19:59.955
Where's your new best friend Caitlyn?

20:00.022 --> 20:02.394
You know, Caitlyn was really cool,

20:02.579 --> 20:05.418
but she started talking
about her fiancé,

20:05.465 --> 20:07.004
and my abandonment issues kicked in,

20:07.029 --> 20:08.593
and I know I've never been abandoned,

20:08.618 --> 20:10.699
but I freaked out
and I broke up with her

20:10.724 --> 20:12.234
before she could break up with me.

20:12.286 --> 20:14.511
What did you just say?
Caitlyn's engaged?

20:14.601 --> 20:17.414
Yeah, to either an author or a golfer.

20:17.439 --> 20:18.542
I couldn't understand
what she was saying,

20:18.566 --> 20:20.053
and I didn't want to be rude.

20:20.078 --> 20:21.425
Guess it's for the better.
I don't need another friend

20:21.449 --> 20:23.041
with a bunch of interests
I don't care about.

20:23.066 --> 20:24.881
Speaking of friendship,
can you pay for this

20:24.906 --> 20:26.172
while I set up for my talk?

20:26.894 --> 20:30.366
He's a sprinkles platinum
diamond rewards member.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.304
She's listed as a spouse.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.365
E-s-t-h-e-r, the rat.

20:36.097 --> 20:37.997
Okay, I'm gonna set up for my talk.
