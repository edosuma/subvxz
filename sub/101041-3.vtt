01:20.013 --> 01:22.015
Wow.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.684
Remember, if Penn and Teller
get fooled,

01:24.717 --> 01:28.388
they give away a slot in their
world-famous magic show,

01:28.421 --> 01:32.158
a classy trophy, and
international bragging rights.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.328
With that in mind,
let's meet our first performer.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.233
- I heard the saying that
nothing makes math sexier

01:40.266 --> 01:42.569
than a board game
or a magic trick,

01:42.602 --> 01:44.070
and I completely agree.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.705
I do a show called
"Super Nerd,"

01:45.738 --> 01:47.440
which features magic, mystery,

01:47.474 --> 01:49.676
and recreational mathematics.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.644
Yeah, I'm definitely
a super nerd.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.012
I love all things nerdy.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.714
I'm not a full-time magician,

01:54.747 --> 01:56.616
and I've never
actually wanted to be.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.952
Because I don't rely on magic
for my income,

01:58.985 --> 02:00.820
my friend and I
started a charity

02:00.854 --> 02:03.490
which allows us to perform
the shows we want to perform,

02:03.523 --> 02:06.526
but all the money goes to
charities we want to support.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.595
Creating the trick
I'm here to do tonight

02:08.627 --> 02:11.531
has been a bit like playing
a "Fool Us" board game.

02:11.564 --> 02:12.832
Hopefully, Penn and Teller
like board games

02:12.866 --> 02:13.833
as much as I do,

02:13.867 --> 02:16.069
because tonight,
I came to play.

[cheers and applause]

02:21.007 --> 02:25.278
- Please welcome Caleb Wiles!

02:25.311 --> 02:26.880
- I've been preparing
for this show

02:26.913 --> 02:28.715
in an interesting way.

02:28.748 --> 02:32.452
Every night, I sit in my room
and I play a board game.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.354
A very specific board game,

02:34.387 --> 02:36.389
one that I actually
created myself.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.158
And I brought that game
along with me tonight

02:38.191 --> 02:39.826
to share with all of you.

02:39.859 --> 02:43.463
I call it "Penn & Teller:
Fool Us, Home Edition."

02:43.496 --> 02:44.964
[laughter]

02:44.998 --> 02:46.799
Alyson, would you like to play?
- Sure!

02:46.833 --> 02:48.902
- Let's give her a round
of applause!

02:48.935 --> 02:51.604
[cheers and applause]
Thank you, Alyson!

02:51.638 --> 02:54.674
Now, Alyson, the set up
to this game is very simple.

02:54.707 --> 02:58.178
We just need to decide
on a target playing card.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.914
Now if you're playing at home,
you can do this at random,

03:00.947 --> 03:02.815
but since we have
Penn and Teller here,

03:02.849 --> 03:05.885
I thought maybe they could help
us decide on the target card.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.253
So, Teller, in a moment,

03:07.287 --> 03:09.822
I'm gonna ask you
to choose a value.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.658
Penn, you will choose a suit,

03:11.691 --> 03:13.526
and together,
we will combine your choices

03:13.560 --> 03:16.696
to create a card that no one
could've possibly known.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.798
Teller, what value
would you like?

03:21.801 --> 03:24.837
A king?
A king, and Penn, the suit.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.407
- Spades.
- The king of spades,

03:27.440 --> 03:28.808
that will be our target card.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.978
Now, Alyson, the object
of this game is to find that

03:32.011 --> 03:34.480
target card in a magic trick,
that's how you win.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.882
- Okay.
- Okay, and in fact

03:35.915 --> 03:37.850
if you find
the King of spades tonight,

03:37.884 --> 03:41.054
I guarantee, you will go home
with the trophy.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.623
- Hey, I like it.
- Yeah.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.092
[cheers and applause]

03:46.125 --> 03:47.493
- Well, that's because
I 3-D printed

03:47.527 --> 03:49.862
one "Fool Us" trophy myself.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.898
- Aww, that's pretty cute.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.167
I'd take it.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.169
I would definitely take it.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.837
- Now, Alyson, inside this box

03:57.870 --> 03:59.739
is literally everything we need

03:59.772 --> 04:02.075
to play a game
of "Fool Us" at home.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.444
For example,
I have the official

04:04.477 --> 04:07.814
"Penn & Teller:
Fool Us, Home Edition"

04:07.847 --> 04:10.083
deck of playing cards.
- Aw.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.485
- And inside this deck
of playing cards,

04:12.518 --> 04:15.255
I have two very special jokers.

04:15.288 --> 04:18.358
These are jokers
you'll actually recognize.

04:18.391 --> 04:22.729
As we spread the pack,
you'll see there's Penn.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.097
- Mm, Big joker.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.165
- And there's Teller.
- Aww.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.168
- Now if we have
Penn and Teller,

04:29.202 --> 04:30.370
you know what else
we need, Alyson.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.804
- What?
- We need the official

04:31.838 --> 04:36.242
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us,
Home Edition" judges' chairs.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.177
- Aww.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.947
- You see, this is
where Penn and Teller

04:40.980 --> 04:43.583
will sit to watch your trick.

04:43.616 --> 04:47.820
And at the end, maybe, they'll
tell us what they think.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.790
My favorite component
is actually the official

04:50.823 --> 04:54.427
"Penn & Teller:
Fool Us, Home Edition" stage.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.995
- Ohh.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.365
- Yes, 'cause this is where
we display the trophy, yes.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.935
And just like in the real show,
the trophy...

05:02.969 --> 05:05.538
- Oh, yeah.
- Hangs high up in the air.

05:05.571 --> 05:09.108
- Aww.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.243
- And remember, Alyson,

05:10.276 --> 05:12.078
if you find
that King of spades,

05:12.111 --> 05:14.080
that trophy belongs to you.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.882
- Well, I'm going home
with that trophy.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.418
- Now that the stage is set.
[chuckles]

05:18.451 --> 05:20.053
Now that the stage is set,

05:20.086 --> 05:22.655
it's time to introduce our
performers for this evening.

05:22.689 --> 05:26.392
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Caleb and Alyson!

05:26.426 --> 05:27.927
- Hey!

05:27.960 --> 05:31.331
[cheers and applause]

05:31.364 --> 05:34.233
Now, Alyson, that is
everything we need to play

05:34.267 --> 05:36.069
a game of "Fool Us."

05:36.102 --> 05:38.271
- Great!
- Now, Alyson, remember,

05:38.304 --> 05:42.942
the object of this game
is to find the King of spades,

05:42.975 --> 05:45.712
wherever it happens
to be in the deck.

05:45.745 --> 05:49.315
And we'll do this with a little
help from Penn and Teller.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.419
Alyson, would you lift off
about half of those cards.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.124
And I'll place Penn and Teller
in at that exact location.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.460
You can actually drop the whole
pile right back on top.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.661
- Oh.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.229
- We'll sort of bury them
in the middle

06:03.262 --> 06:05.231
and hold it face
down in your hands.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.899
- Easier said than done.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.601
- You're doing great.

06:08.634 --> 06:12.105
Now, earlier, we had the real
Penn and Teller work together

06:12.138 --> 06:13.840
to create a playing card.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.475
That's how they chose
their card,

06:15.508 --> 06:17.343
and in a moment,
miniature Penn and Teller

06:17.377 --> 06:19.078
are gonna do the same thing.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.914
All you have to do is give the
cards a little shake like this.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.549
Perfect, a professional.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.853
Now you can spread the cards
face down across the table.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.020
- Aw, man.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.422
- You're doing good.
You're doing good.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.891
- I should really practice
during the down season.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.559
- We are hunting for those
Penn and Teller cards,

06:33.593 --> 06:35.728
I think I see one of them
poking out here.

06:35.762 --> 06:36.996
- I do too.
- There's Teller.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.464
- I see Teller!
- Keep spreading,

06:38.498 --> 06:39.532
I think there's Penn.
- Hey!

06:39.565 --> 06:41.134
- Something has happened,
Alyson!

06:41.167 --> 06:45.104
There is now one card
face down in between.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.273
That's the card
that they picked.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.943
And wouldn't it be amazing
if they picked the same card

06:50.977 --> 06:53.746
as the real Penn and Teller.
- Yeah.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.181
- Do you remember
what we're looking for?

06:55.214 --> 06:58.117
- The king of spades.
- The king of spades.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.520
Go ahead and turn it
over yourself.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.755
- What?
- You did it!

07:02.789 --> 07:05.858
[cheers and applause]

07:05.892 --> 07:10.129
Now, you are right, Alyson,
you won the game,

07:10.163 --> 07:11.764
so you win the trophy.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.366
- Yay!
- And let's give it up

07:13.399 --> 07:15.535
for Alyson Hannigan!

07:15.568 --> 07:17.403
[cheers and applause]

07:17.437 --> 07:19.639
- Ah.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.708
- Now, Alyson, I'm very happy
you won the game.

07:22.742 --> 07:23.843
- Me too.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.745
- And I'm glad
you earned the trophy.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.916
But I have to admit, I'm hoping
that maybe I can go home

07:29.949 --> 07:31.517
with the trophy
tonight as well.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.053
That's why there's one
more phase to this game.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.255
You see, when I was designing
all of these components

07:36.289 --> 07:38.357
for the game,
I tried to simulate

07:38.391 --> 07:41.260
this "Fool Us" experience
as closely as possible.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.695
But I don't just mean
"Fool Us" in general,

07:42.728 --> 07:46.332
I mean this specific
"Fool Us" experience.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.335
You see, even though
Penn and Teller

07:49.368 --> 07:51.137
could have worked together

07:51.170 --> 07:54.974
to select any one of these
52 playing cards,

07:55.007 --> 07:59.212
I knew that Teller
would want to go for a king.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.614
And that Penn would want
to go for the spades.

08:01.647 --> 08:06.452
And that together, they would
create the king of spades.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.722
- Ahh.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.591
Yay.
- And that's how you play

08:11.624 --> 08:14.193
"Penn & Teller:
Fool Us, Home Edition."

08:14.227 --> 08:16.896
- Aww.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.031
Caleb Wiles!

08:19.065 --> 08:22.068
[cheers and applause]

08:24.003 --> 08:26.105
This is so creative.
- Yes.

08:26.138 --> 08:29.509
My two passions in life
are magic and board games,

08:29.542 --> 08:31.611
so I thought I had
to combine the two

08:31.644 --> 08:32.879
if I was gonna
come on "Fool Us."

08:32.912 --> 08:34.847
It was many weekends
up late at night.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.682
It was a lot of work,
but I wouldn't have been able

08:36.716 --> 08:38.751
to do it without all my family
and friends helping me out.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.087
- And is it designed
to always win?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.456
- Yes, it was rigged
in your favor, Alyson.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.825
- That's my favorite type
of magic trick.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.461
Hopefully it's rigged
in your favor too.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.929
- We'll see.

08:49.962 --> 08:52.665
- All right, it's time to put
Penn and Teller on the spot.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.033
Guys!

08:54.066 --> 08:56.435
- Oh, we're so flattered.
What a lot of work.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.637
- Yes.
- That's beautiful.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.205
We don't even wanna talk
about your trick.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.840
We just wanna talk
about the home game.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.141
- Yes.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.410
- The home game seems
like such a great idea.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.078
It wouldn't only be
this trick, right?

09:06.112 --> 09:07.480
There would be other tricks.
- Sure, yeah.

09:07.513 --> 09:08.981
- So there would be
a whole index in there

09:09.015 --> 09:10.449
of how you pick which trick

09:10.483 --> 09:12.051
you're gonna do
and all of that,

09:12.084 --> 09:14.186
and is this
a durable home game?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.188
I mean, once you've played
with the deck for a while,

09:16.222 --> 09:18.925
would you have another deck
you could bring in after that,

09:18.958 --> 09:20.326
so it would never wear out?

09:20.359 --> 09:22.395
Just keep going,
playing the home game forever?

09:22.428 --> 09:24.096
- Yeah, yeah.
- Now, you'd been working

09:24.130 --> 09:25.831
on this for a while, right?
- Yeah.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.466
- So all the directions
that are in there,

09:27.500 --> 09:28.868
you have them memorized,
I'm sure.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.403
- I do.
- This is a great,

09:30.436 --> 09:31.771
great idea for "Fool Us."

09:31.804 --> 09:33.172
We'd be playing at home.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.208
I think you've worked out
absolutely all the problems,

09:36.242 --> 09:40.580
and as far as the trick,
we had a couple ideas in there.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.248
- Okay.
- About how you did it.

I have a prediction over here.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.884
Alyson, for the first time,
can you open that up?

25:18.917 --> 25:22.320
- Okay.
- Read that out loud, it says--

25:22.354 --> 25:26.591
- It says "the luckiest person
will be wearing a black jacket,

25:26.625 --> 25:30.762
purple shirt, glasses,
and has a beard."

25:30.795 --> 25:32.364
- Come on, guys!

25:32.397 --> 25:34.499
[cheers and applause]

25:34.533 --> 25:37.903
You're awesome, thank you.

a big round of applause.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.907
You were awesome, man.
Go back to your seat.

Thank you very much.
- Wes Iseli, everyone!

25:46.878 --> 25:48.480
Wow.

25:48.513 --> 25:51.616
So, what's the best
part of magic for you?

25:51.650 --> 25:53.451
- Just the fact that I get
to do it with my family.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.120
- Your daughter
performs as well?

25:55.153 --> 25:56.955
- Yeah, I have
an eight-year-old daughter,

25:56.988 --> 25:59.958
and she's on the road with us,
my wife and daughter and I.

25:59.991 --> 26:01.960
- Wow, and when did
she start performing?

26:01.993 --> 26:03.562
- When she was four days old.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.497
- Four days.
- Four days old.

26:05.530 --> 26:09.067
So my wife was told
that we were gonna have a baby

26:09.100 --> 26:10.969
December 31st.

26:11.002 --> 26:13.071
That's great,
but that's New Year's Eve.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.240
That's a big night
for magicians.

26:15.273 --> 26:17.609
So I'm like if I'm not
at this show, I could get sued.

26:17.642 --> 26:19.911
If I'm not there
for the birth of my child,

26:19.945 --> 26:21.046
my wife's gonna kill me.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.681
- Yeah.
- Dude, what can we do?

26:22.714 --> 26:24.382
So we induced her,
she was born on the 28th

26:24.416 --> 26:25.717
and four days later,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.652
we took a final bow with her
at the end of the show, so.

26:27.686 --> 26:31.056
- Aww, that's fantastic.
- There you go, yeah.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.225
- Aww.
Is she here tonight?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.827
- Yes, my wife and daughter
are in the audience.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.228
Wave, girls, wave.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.697
- Hi.
- There they are.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.832
- Aww.

26:40.865 --> 26:42.500
All right,
well let's go to the guys

26:42.534 --> 26:43.835
and to see if you fooled them.

26:43.868 --> 26:46.705
- All right.
- Penn, Teller.

26:46.738 --> 26:49.074
- I got to tell you, Wes.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.176
First thing Teller said to me,

26:51.209 --> 26:54.946
"That is the most Penn trick
we've ever had on the show."

26:54.980 --> 26:57.916
That is a trick
I have been trying to do

26:57.949 --> 26:59.417
for about ten years.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.419
I always want
the entire audience

27:01.453 --> 27:03.221
to be voting and be eliminated.

27:03.254 --> 27:04.823
I'm always looking for that.

27:04.856 --> 27:07.258
As soon as you started it,
started the premise,

27:07.292 --> 27:11.129
I was just crazy in love
with this routine.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.164
I don't care
what Teller thinks of it.

27:13.198 --> 27:16.534
Although Teller liked it,
I liked it more.

27:16.568 --> 27:20.538

27:20.572 --> 27:25.810
We also loved the fact that you
traveled here with just a coin.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.647
Now, here's where we come down
to where the game

27:28.680 --> 27:30.982
is actually played, okay?

27:31.016 --> 27:35.120
We first thought that you were
taking a glimpse of the coin

27:35.153 --> 27:36.888
before you decided
head or tails.

27:36.921 --> 27:38.723
We decided you didn't do that.

27:38.757 --> 27:40.725
We know you did not
get a glimpse.

27:40.759 --> 27:44.162
We think there's a switch there
after she examined it

27:44.195 --> 27:45.930
and you're using
a gaffed coin.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.466
We're trusting you on your
honor, is the coin gaffed?

27:51.903 --> 27:54.239
Not a gaffed coin at all?

27:54.272 --> 27:56.174
- No, sir.

we're not done yet.

I like more than chance.

I'm gonna call it.

you didn't fool us.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.335

you fooled it.

I'll let you take
a peek right now.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.618
- I grew up with
a family of magicians.

29:46.651 --> 29:49.354
My dad and my mom
worked together.

29:49.387 --> 29:51.289
I was my dad's
little assistant,

I was five years old.

I loved to read
fashion magazines.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.203
Fashion for me
was always life.

30:05.236 --> 30:08.740
Fashion just expresses
your personality.

30:08.773 --> 30:12.076
Then I thought I could use
fashion to do some magic.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.345
There aren't any books
about how to do fashion magic,

we have ranted and raved

34:13.317 --> 34:16.788
about how the boys club
has never let women in.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.856

34:18.889 --> 34:22.527

34:22.560 --> 34:25.295

- Yes, Teller, that is great.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.936
- I love that already.
- Oh, yeah.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.771
- It's really nice.
- Yeah.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.044
[laughter]

37:30.648 --> 37:33.384

no flash photography.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.119
[laughter]

37:36.354 --> 37:38.089

Still going.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.865
- Wow, that's incredible.
- Hey.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.868
I got the saw.
- Okay.

37:50.901 --> 37:53.371
And I've got the stun guns.
- [laughs] Start 'em up.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.905
[stun guns crackling]

37:56.907 --> 37:59.277
[chain saw revving]

38:05.016 --> 38:07.351
[cheering and laughter]

38:15.960 --> 38:17.662
Look at that!
Oh, hey!

38:17.695 --> 38:19.463
- Here you go.
- Penn! Great idea!

38:19.497 --> 38:21.065
- Take the middle ones there.
- Yeah.

38:21.098 --> 38:22.667

38:22.700 --> 38:24.235

38:24.268 --> 38:27.872
No flash photography, please.
Teller's doing a beautiful job.

38:27.905 --> 38:30.708

38:30.741 --> 38:33.811
[cheers and applause]

38:35.379 --> 38:38.149
Up.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.518
There it is.
- Okay, there we go.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.086
Nicely done, Penn.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.422
- Nicely done, Penn.
Hey, one more thing.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.457
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
let's go get it.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.927
- Yeah, please, once again,
no flash photography,

38:49.960 --> 38:52.863
Teller needs to focus
and concentrate.

38:52.897 --> 38:55.433
[laughter]

39:05.042 --> 39:06.610
- Are you guys ready?
- Ready.

39:06.644 --> 39:09.714
- Let's do this.
- Here we go.

39:09.747 --> 39:12.950
- Remember,
no flash photography.

39:12.983 --> 39:14.018
Let Teller focus.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.553
- I almost forgot
the blindfold.

39:15.586 --> 39:17.021
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm ready.

39:17.054 --> 39:19.457
Penn, tell him where to throw.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.791
Now.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.060
- Higher!
- Now.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.396
- Higher!

39:25.429 --> 39:26.664
- Now.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.965
- To the right!

39:27.998 --> 39:28.966
- Now!

39:28.999 --> 39:31.969
- To the left!

39:32.002 --> 39:33.771
Beautiful.

39:33.804 --> 39:35.873
Come on, look at this.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.375
That's really amazing.

39:37.408 --> 39:39.410
- Oh, man.
- Just glorious.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.645

39:49.053 --> 39:51.055
- [stammering]
- Oh.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.758
- I thought I said no--

39:53.791 --> 39:55.192
No...

39:55.226 --> 39:57.395
There was supposed to be no--
- I'm so sorry, Teller.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.730
- Aww.
- Sorry.

39:59.764 --> 40:02.500
- Wow.
Whoo!

40:02.533 --> 40:05.002
Well.
Hi!

40:05.035 --> 40:07.872
That wraps it up
for us here at "Fool Us."

40:07.905 --> 40:11.542
Don't be a stranger, come back
