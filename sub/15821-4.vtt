00:29.930 --> 00:32.670
Deputy chief brenda johnson,L.A.P.D.

00:32.710 --> 00:34.010
Party of one.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.600
Well,we have your crime scene ready for you,

00:36.670 --> 00:38.320
if you'll just step right this way.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.580
Thank you,sir.

00:56.670 --> 00:58.630
Meet karen bivas,

00:58.900 --> 01:01.350
managing partner of chez paul,

01:01.430 --> 01:04.620
L.A.'S newest 5-star restaurant.

01:05.260 --> 01:09.000
She clocked out for life between 2 and 3 A.M.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.920
She's still wearing her necklace and a wedding ring.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.250
Can we rule out robbery ?

01:13.290 --> 01:15.780
Well,no cash was stolen.The,uh--

01:15.830 --> 01:17.210
the safe was locked.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.610
Purse had money and credit cards.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.460
Nice dress,by the way.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.800
Yours,I mean. Not hers.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.810
Oh,thank you.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.120
I'm going straight to dinner after work today.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.390
Uh,her lip is swollen.Is that from the fall ?

01:34.800 --> 01:36.560
No,whoever did this

01:36.640 --> 01:39.140
probably started with a punch to the mouth.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.450
Wonder what she was saying.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.130
How many stab wounds ?

01:44.210 --> 01:47.040
The coroner's investigator counted 18,

01:47.120 --> 01:48.110
but I see a

01:48.350 --> 01:51.120
slash across her neck there that made the mess.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.360
It looks like she tried to run from her attacker.

01:53.470 --> 01:55.080
Someone has a temper.

01:55.940 --> 01:57.560
Clocked out,you said ?

01:57.630 --> 01:58.800
How do you know she was working ?

01:58.880 --> 02:02.390
Oh,we found the manager's log book on the counter.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.070
Let's compare the residue from these pots and pans

02:07.130 --> 02:10.000
with the contents of her stomach. Hmm.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.660
And this kitchen is full of potential murder weapons.Sergeant

02:16.740 --> 02:18.800
let's please gather up all these knives

02:18.870 --> 02:20.420
and have them brought to the morgue.

02:20.530 --> 02:23.160
We'll match 'em up against the victim's wounds.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.840
Thank you.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.120
Well,at least she wasn't eating alone.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.880
Could you please find someone who could tell me

02:42.960 --> 02:44.900
what's in that so-called log book ?

02:44.940 --> 02:45.970
Thank you.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.610
And,uh,detective daniels,

02:47.690 --> 02:49.640
karen bivas's driver's license shows her living

02:49.720 --> 02:51.630
at an address on north quenga boulevard,

02:51.700 --> 02:53.520
so how did she get to be a managing partner

02:53.570 --> 02:55.220
of a high-falutin' place like this ?

02:55.290 --> 02:57.470
Could you look into her finances,please ?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.540
Yes,ma'am.--Thank you.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.160
Her husband's here.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.690
Outside ?--Yes.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.700
Who called him ?

03:03.730 --> 03:07.350
No one. He's the chef--the paul in chez paul.And he wants in.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.860
Right.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.400
This is my restaurant,let me in,you!

03:11.480 --> 03:12.970
I want to see my wife.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.850
Let me in!

03:14.930 --> 03:17.480
Mr. Bivas!Mr. Bivas,stand back.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.780
Let me explain.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.650
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the L.A.P.D.

03:20.730 --> 03:21.800
Where is karen ?

03:21.880 --> 03:23.210
Is she in there ?

03:24.100 --> 03:26.260
Sir,when was the last time 
you saw your wife ?

03:26.560 --> 03:29.780
Around midnight.She was managing 
the dining room floor.

03:30.570 --> 03:31.570
Is she missing ?

03:31.650 --> 03:34.330
Where you concerned when 
she didn't come home last night ?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.630
We're working all the time right now.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.360
We don't have the same hours.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.030
Please,

03:40.110 --> 03:42.300
will you tell me karen is ok ?

03:42.800 --> 03:44.700
Could you please tell me that ?

03:45.150 --> 03:47.480
Mr. Bivas,I'm very sorry to inform you

03:47.560 --> 03:50.970
that your wife was murdered last night 
in the kitchen of your restaurant.

03:55.710 --> 03:57.040
No.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.340
I don't believe you.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.240
I want to see her.

04:01.630 --> 04:03.680
I want to see her right now!

04:03.780 --> 04:05.460
I want to see her right now!

04:05.540 --> 04:05.940
I want to see--

04:06.010 --> 04:07.450
sir!That is not possible.

04:07.530 --> 04:08.670
This is a crime scene.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.650
If you'd like,I can arrange someone to be with you.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.520
Go away.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.290
I don't want you here.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.370
Get away from my restaurant.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.579
I'm very sorry.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.180
I said go away!

04:21.800 --> 04:22.900
Get out!

04:23.520 --> 04:26.800
I don't want you here.Just leave me alone.

04:28.030 --> 04:30.500
Just leave.Leave me alone.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.070
Louis,the,uh,garde manger

04:42.140 --> 04:44.390
said that karen was tough but fair

04:44.450 --> 04:46.670
even though her personal life was a little messy.

04:46.740 --> 04:49.220
Bernard,the saucy-er

04:49.300 --> 04:51.970
said she was polite but firm.

04:52.040 --> 04:52.880
Saucier.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.030
Now gamon,

04:54.110 --> 04:55.860
the sommie-lier...

04:55.940 --> 04:56.790
Sommelier.

04:56.870 --> 04:59.280
Said she was a bossy,micro-managing bitch.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.270
But he respected her,

05:00.350 --> 05:02.210
even though she was stingy on the compliments.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.850
I mean,you know the type,chief.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.120
detective sanchez,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.480
you interviewed the spanish speaking employees ?

05:08.560 --> 05:09.860
Si,mi heffe.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.250
Kitchen staff,mostly.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.530
And,did they say anything about chef paul ?

05:13.610 --> 05:14.600
Drinks too much,

05:14.680 --> 05:16.020
needs a keeper,

05:16.090 --> 05:18.570
last week threw a half-cooked duck at his wife,

05:18.640 --> 05:21.410
but he missed,so they think that he loved her.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.490
Uh,lieutenant provenza,

05:23.560 --> 05:25.430
any help from the log book ?

05:25.580 --> 05:27.930
on the evening of the murder,

05:28.060 --> 05:30.900
chez paul served 11 employee meals.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.890
Mrs. Bivas did not partake.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.650
The light bulb in the ladies john blew out,

05:34.730 --> 05:37.250
D.D. And T.N.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.970
Were comped for a dinner of $436.

05:42.090 --> 05:45.010
The kitchen ran out of the halibut special around 10 P.M.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.420
Sounds like motive to me.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.650
Excuse me,lieutenant,

05:47.690 --> 05:49.250
what were those initials again,please ?

05:49.330 --> 05:51.200
D.D. And T.N.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.920
Oh,and sergeant gabriel called,and uh,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.710
none of the knives at chez paul fit the wound.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.440
Chief johnson ?--Yes,oh!

05:58.820 --> 06:02.930
Oh,thank you.Thank you

06:04.330 --> 06:06.000
very much. Um...

06:06.120 --> 06:08.410
um,I...

06:08.490 --> 06:10.510
pardon me

06:10.630 --> 06:14.170
just one--one minute.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.330
Chief ?

06:31.410 --> 06:33.770
Oh.Sorry to interrupt.

06:33.850 --> 06:34.770
Ok.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.660
I found where the money came from for the restaurant.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.300
One investor--a swiss holding company

06:40.370 --> 06:42.360
owned by the dutton group.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.780
Dutton ?

06:43.860 --> 06:44.940
As in dennis dutton ?

06:45.020 --> 06:45.900
As in the guy who beat

06:46.000 --> 06:47.940
his ex-girlfriend to death with a golf club.

06:47.980 --> 06:50.340
As in D.D.From the log book.

06:50.420 --> 06:53.170
He ate at chez paul last night ?

06:56.970 --> 06:59.620
Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson,

06:59.850 --> 07:01.280
we meet again.

07:02.730 --> 07:05.240
I was just re-acquainting myself with your file.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.390
Really ?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.110
And I like to think of myself as unforgettable.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.870
Why is it,mr. Dutton,

07:10.910 --> 07:12.410
that you're always one or two steps away

07:12.480 --> 07:13.380
from a murdered woman ?

07:13.460 --> 07:14.820
So much for hello.

07:14.970 --> 07:17.220
If you want to talk about old unsolved murders,

07:17.300 --> 07:19.480
I'll put you in touch with my new attorney.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.760
But...

07:20.840 --> 07:23.230
if you want to talk about chez paul,

07:23.310 --> 07:25.100
you'll find me in a helpful frame of mind

07:25.180 --> 07:26.940
since I'm its primary investor.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.560
Over $2 million.That's a lot of money.

07:31.090 --> 07:32.500
To you.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.020
Look,I hardly even knew karen or paul.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.310
I gave them some cash on the advice of a friend.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.960
So,since you're obviously in a mood to cut to the chase,

07:42.140 --> 07:43.880
why don't we get to my alibi ?

07:43.980 --> 07:45.280
Let'S.

07:45.390 --> 07:47.790
You ate dinner last night at the restaurant with--

07:47.870 --> 07:50.270
tom newman.An influential food critic

07:50.340 --> 07:51.980
who was impressed enough with chez paul.

07:52.060 --> 07:55.170
Ahem,to,uh,write us a terrific review.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.860
I asked him to dinner as a way of saying thanks.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.750
That was yesterday's evil plot.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.460
You left the restaurant at 11:00.

08:04.530 --> 08:05.830
Where were you after that ?

08:08.210 --> 08:11.210
I accepted tom's invitation to stop by 
the house for a bottle or two...

08:11.360 --> 08:13.210
of a 1986 chateau margo,

08:13.330 --> 08:15.730
which I'd been saving for A...

08:16.230 --> 08:17.900
special occasion.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.970
One bottle--heh!Would have been enough.

08:22.310 --> 08:23.840
Might have overdone it.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.400
I'd been a little blue

08:26.500 --> 08:28.250
since my wife left me.

08:29.020 --> 08:29.800
And...

08:30.000 --> 08:31.160
dennis and I talked about how maybe

08:31.240 --> 08:32.929
i should open up my own restaurant again.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.720
It's interesting,really.

08:34.820 --> 08:36.690
Because that story you just told me--

08:36.770 --> 08:38.809
it's almost word for word

08:38.880 --> 08:40.530
what dennis dutton said when he was sitting

08:40.610 --> 08:43.559
in that exact same chair not 45 minutes ago.

08:43.750 --> 08:47.400
Up to and including the part about being a little blue

08:47.440 --> 08:49.120
about your wife leaving you.

08:49.190 --> 08:50.640
Well,it's uh--

08:50.910 --> 08:52.670
it's what happened.So

08:52.780 --> 08:54.450
how else would I say it ?

08:55.870 --> 08:58.040
Dennis--he's a friend of yours,right ?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.910
I like to think so.We don't travel in

08:59.990 --> 09:02.180
the same social circle,but,uh,

09:02.620 --> 09:04.490
he invests in a lot of restaurants.

09:04.570 --> 09:07.620
And dennis has extremely good taste.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.540
And you are an expert on good taste ?

09:10.890 --> 09:15.560
Karen bivas's first offering since leaving lambeaus last year,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.420
chez paul is a wonder.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.020
A piece of provence on melrose.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.930
Upon entering,I experienced a frizum ?

09:23.660 --> 09:24.960
Frissom.

09:25.030 --> 09:29.740
French for,experiential excitement.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.040
It means I liked the place.

09:32.110 --> 09:33.740
It's also a lovely 5 star review

09:33.820 --> 09:35.830
for your good friend dennis dutton.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.370
I hear what you're implying,

09:38.450 --> 09:40.740
and I don't sell my reviews.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.590
Nor do i cut friends slack

09:43.710 --> 09:46.550
for sloppy work.Chez paul is exactly as I described.

09:46.630 --> 09:47.470
You know,

09:47.540 --> 09:49.640
speaking of cutting people slack,

09:49.870 --> 09:52.810
this is what someone did to karen bivas

09:53.280 --> 09:54.760
last night.

09:54.950 --> 09:58.300
I want you to take a good,hard look,mr. Newman.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.160
We've collected every knife from that restaurant,

10:03.200 --> 10:06.940
and if we find one with dennis 
dutton's fingerprints on them,

10:07.020 --> 10:09.190
your alibi for him,mr. Newman,

10:09.270 --> 10:11.310
makes you an accomplice after the fact.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.960
To murder.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.880
Now,I don't know what dennis promised you.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.760
Pardon me,I'm sorry.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.430
You don't have all the knives.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.650
Excuse me ?

10:21.710 --> 10:23.390
These are just the kitchen knives.

10:23.470 --> 10:26.290
A chef's knives are more personal

10:26.360 --> 10:29.170
to him and expensive.He would wrap them up and take them home

10:29.240 --> 10:32.690
at the end of his shift,always.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.250
Detective daniels,

10:36.290 --> 10:38.810
see if you can find another financial connection

10:38.890 --> 10:40.910
between karen bivas and dennis dutton.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.850
And have detective sanchez go by a food critic's house

10:43.930 --> 10:45.750
and see if he'll give us his trash.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.650
Yes,thank you.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.850
Sure you don't want the whole search unit ?

10:49.920 --> 10:51.830
No,I want flynn and provenza to stay back

10:51.870 --> 10:53.560
so that they can follow him when I'm done.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.970
And I don't want to alarm the guy.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.260
He might be seriously mourning the death of his wife.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.740
Mr. Bivas,I'm deputy chief--

10:59.810 --> 11:00.900
I know.

11:01.550 --> 11:04.350
You're the one who wouldn't let me see my wife's body.

11:04.470 --> 11:06.090
Sir,if you could,

11:06.260 --> 11:08.050
we really need your help.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.650
My wife was murdered,and you want my help ?

11:15.150 --> 11:18.040
Sure. At your service.

11:18.150 --> 11:19.450
Thank you.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.850
You have to excuse me.I had a death in the family.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.360
What do you need ?

11:35.050 --> 11:36.370
How can I assist you ?

11:36.440 --> 11:38.960
Well,anything you can tell us can be helpful.

11:39.040 --> 11:39.870
But specifically,

11:39.940 --> 11:42.610
I was wondering if you owned a personal set of knives.

11:42.690 --> 11:45.080
Yes,of course.What do you think ?

11:45.650 --> 11:47.390
May I see them ?

11:48.790 --> 11:52.150
I have a warrant to look for them,but I'd rather not serve it.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.000
Why do you want my knives ?

12:00.180 --> 12:02.090
You suspect me,huh ?

12:02.900 --> 12:04.100
Is that it ?

12:04.250 --> 12:05.640
You suspect i killed my wife ?

12:05.750 --> 12:08.080
Mr. Bivas,I don't want to make 
this day any more difficult

12:08.150 --> 12:09.950
than necessary,but if you don't--

12:09.990 --> 12:11.710
I want you to leave.Now!

12:11.750 --> 12:14.750
Sergeant gabriel,please alert 
the units we require backup.

12:16.700 --> 12:17.960
Wait!

12:23.180 --> 12:24.150
Hell.

12:24.230 --> 12:26.210
Sure,why not ?

12:26.550 --> 12:28.670
You want my knives ?I'll give them to you.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.650
Hey,you know what ?I'll take it from here.

12:30.690 --> 12:33.440
All right ? Why don't you take a step back over that way.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.950
Thank you,sir.

12:58.410 --> 13:01.550
well,i excile the deep muscle wound in your victim

13:01.630 --> 13:03.920
and inserted every likely knife.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.020
So far,nothing.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.990
Well,how about these.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.830
Hmm,ceramic.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.210
Huh,fancy

13:13.320 --> 13:15.520
and very sharp.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.760
See,we can eliminate the short knives,

13:18.840 --> 13:20.760
because the wound is so very deep.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.090
And the serrated edge.What we're looking for

13:23.170 --> 13:31.070
is a single edge with a very fine point.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.580
Ecch. I think I just became a vegetarian.

13:35.660 --> 13:37.640
Have you determined the contents of her stomach ?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.590
Um,let me see,where is it ?

13:39.660 --> 13:40.620
Ah. Here we go.

13:40.780 --> 13:41.920
Well...

13:42.020 --> 13:43.650
pretty exotic meal.

13:43.770 --> 13:46.320
Poor woman didn't get much of a chance to enjoy it.

13:46.440 --> 13:50.740
Ok,gastric contents,about 500 
milliliters of chewed,semi-solid food.

13:50.820 --> 13:54.790
Lettuce,soft cheese,mushrooms,white asparagus,

13:54.860 --> 13:57.670
and a very lean meat--ostrich.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.130
Ostrich ?

14:00.620 --> 14:03.710
Followed by a nice red wine.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.200
Oh. Well,the good news is

14:10.280 --> 14:12.320
we can stop looking for the knife.

14:13.890 --> 14:15.730
This murder is very hard,

14:15.810 --> 14:17.580
and everyone's pulling a second shift,and

14:17.650 --> 14:21.010
I know you wanted to take me out to a restaurant,but I just--

14:21.080 --> 14:22.770
I really don't think i'm in the mood.

14:22.850 --> 14:24.910
It's all right.I already canceled the reservation.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.890
You did ? When ?

14:26.970 --> 14:29.650
Just a little after you got called in this morning.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.050
You're calling to cancel,right ?

14:32.170 --> 14:35.830
Yeah,I'm sorry.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.010
I just--

14:37.090 --> 14:38.120
I'm really...

14:38.270 --> 14:40.560
having a hard time with this birthday,that's all.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.110
Hey,you're human.That's allowed.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.970
Hey,did you get the flowers I sent you ?

14:46.100 --> 14:47.970
Oh! I did.

14:48.090 --> 14:49.460
I'm sorry.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.560
They're very pretty.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.720
And big.

14:55.860 --> 14:57.610
Oh,I'm sorry.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.320
My meeting's ready.I gotta go.

14:59.360 --> 14:59.980
All right bye.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.280
Bye.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.280
Commander.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.490
Chief.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.530
Um,I,uh--

15:09.170 --> 15:11.790
I just need a little clarification about

15:11.850 --> 15:13.200
why you want so many people from

15:13.280 --> 15:15.720
the hollywood division to help you with this case.

15:15.800 --> 15:20.780
You have a likely suspect and a weapon,too,no ?

15:20.850 --> 15:23.290
The blade fits,but we have no forensic evidence

15:23.350 --> 15:24.950
tying that particular knife to the murder.

15:25.030 --> 15:27.490
It only suggests that the killer might've been a cook.

15:27.570 --> 15:31.730
Yeah,I believe the french term is chef,which the husband is,

15:31.810 --> 15:33.640
and he's roaming the streets.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.530
We have flynn and provenza tailing him,

15:35.610 --> 15:36.950
so if he has a girlfriend,

15:37.010 --> 15:39.560
or it turns out that he tries to flee the country,

15:39.660 --> 15:41.000
we'll find out about it.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.840
But,as it turns out,

15:42.920 --> 15:45.020
we have another suspect in the mix,

15:45.090 --> 15:49.290
because chez paul's sole investor is dennis dutton.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.780
And he was there last night.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.830
That's not good.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.720
But he has an alibi.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.580
Oh. Well,that's not good,either.

15:56.650 --> 15:59.140
And she wants us to serve search warrants on the

15:59.180 --> 16:01.850
dutton estate so we can grab last night's tapes

16:01.890 --> 16:03.550
off of all the security cameras.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.000
I need to find out when he came home last night.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.990
And she wants 7/24 surveillance on the guy after that.

16:09.020 --> 16:12.410
In case he tries to flee the country,which he's done before.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.170
But--wait a minute.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.600
Maybe there's something i'm not understanding.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.690
You said dutton has an alibi.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.730
Yeah,but I don't like it.

16:21.890 --> 16:24.420
Oh. Well,I'll be sure and pass that along to the judge

16:24.460 --> 16:25.990
when we ask for a search warrant.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.980
Look,you have a team.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.080
You manage their resources.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.910
You have 2 people on the chef.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.800
Obviously you think he might have done it.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.290
Um,what can I say ?

16:38.090 --> 16:40.780
Either break the alibi that dutton has,

16:40.860 --> 16:43.090
or come back with a better story.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.940
Please.

16:46.900 --> 16:47.820
Gabriel.

16:49.960 --> 16:50.760
Oh,I'm sorry.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.210
Oh,I'm sorry.

16:52.290 --> 16:53.700
Oh,I'm so sorry.

16:53.740 --> 16:54.820
Oh,good.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.390
Stopped by our food critic's house.

16:56.460 --> 16:59.510
His garbage was in the garage,so I asked him for it.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.720
He didn't seem nervous about it.

17:02.390 --> 17:04.690
Chateau margot '86.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.000
Isn't that what

17:06.079 --> 17:08.250
newman said he and dennis were drinking ?

17:08.329 --> 17:09.670
Yes,it is.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.040
We should have those dusted for prints.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.760
I believe we have dennis' on file.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.180
If his fingers even touched these bottles,

17:19.220 --> 17:20.700
I'll eat my words.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.270
What about lieutenant provenza ?

17:24.339 --> 17:25.780
Have we heard anything from him ?

17:25.890 --> 17:29.190
Or has chef paul done anything incriminating,

17:29.260 --> 17:31.640
like walking around hollywood waving a knife in the air,

17:31.720 --> 17:34.740
saying,"hey,I killed my wife.Who wants me next ?"

17:36.540 --> 17:39.510
Uh,no,and no.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.600
Ok.

17:43.030 --> 17:45.760
I'm gonna take these flowers down to my car.

17:45.870 --> 17:47.320
Pardon me.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.130
Pardon.thank you.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.760
She's weirder than usual today.

17:54.830 --> 17:58.270
Hey,people think being the boss is so great.It's not.

17:58.890 --> 18:00.250
It's hard work.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.190
Yeah,she's a little weirder than usual.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.320
Chief ?

18:15.960 --> 18:17.830
Are you all right ?

18:17.910 --> 18:20.800
Yes,I just...

18:22.250 --> 18:25.050
not where I expected to be today,is all.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.540
Right,you were going to dinner.

18:28.990 --> 18:30.140
What ?

18:32.710 --> 18:34.960
Oh. Right.

18:36.610 --> 18:37.790
Right.

18:39.460 --> 18:42.590
I was. I was.Were you looking for me ?

18:42.670 --> 18:44.880
Uh,dennis dutton.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.150
He said he didn't really know paul or karen bivas

18:48.190 --> 18:49.830
before investing in their restaurant,right ?

18:49.910 --> 18:50.600
Right.

18:50.670 --> 18:51.880
Well,that's funny,because I read

18:51.960 --> 18:53.860
tom newman's review of chez paul,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.780
and the restaurant karen worked at

18:55.860 --> 18:58.730
before she and her husband opened theirs,l'amboise ?

18:58.810 --> 18:59.570
Yes ?

18:59.650 --> 19:02.290
Meet one of their limited partners.

19:02.370 --> 19:03.700
Dennis dutton.

19:03.780 --> 19:07.860
You're blowing this way out of proportion,as I knew you would.

19:08.150 --> 19:11.440
Karen managed the dining room for walter lasalle,

19:11.550 --> 19:14.110
who owns 3/4 of l'amboise,by the way.

19:14.230 --> 19:15.450
And one night,

19:15.530 --> 19:16.750
while she was seating me,

19:16.830 --> 19:18.200
karen mentioned that she and her husband

19:18.280 --> 19:20.080
were thinking of opening a restaurant of their own,

19:20.120 --> 19:21.380
which concerned me.

19:22.450 --> 19:24.380
Look,paul bivas was the reason most people were

19:24.420 --> 19:25.890
coming to l'amboise in the first place.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.590
What about walter lasalle ?

19:28.490 --> 19:30.580
Walter only owned the place.

19:30.690 --> 19:33.250
He's a professional snob,not a cook.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.680
So,karen showed me her business plan,

19:35.750 --> 19:37.300
I gave her the money,the end.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.440
And how did walter take the news that his chef

19:39.520 --> 19:41.460
and manager were leaving ?

19:43.180 --> 19:45.440
I always wondered what made him angrier--

19:45.520 --> 19:48.500
them quitting,or karen breaking off their relationship.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.550
Are you saying that walter and karen had an affair ?

19:52.630 --> 19:56.180
No. I'm saying they had sex.

19:57.810 --> 19:59.750
Did chef paul know ?

19:59.870 --> 20:00.340
No.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.590
How can you be so sure ?

20:01.670 --> 20:04.390
Because walter lasalle is still alive.

20:06.660 --> 20:09.050
If you had plans for this evening,

20:09.350 --> 20:11.950
now might be a good time for you to cancel them.

20:21.190 --> 20:24.410
I'm telling you,flynn,this guy's drunk as a skunk.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.930
Really ? Yeah.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.310
Well,let me ask you.

20:27.390 --> 20:30.090
You usually get bombed before you go out to dinner ?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.640
Depends on who my date is.

20:33.730 --> 20:36.200
At least he hasn't gone inside.

20:37.990 --> 20:40.170
Pacing,pacing.

20:42.950 --> 20:47.200
Walking around this ugly track--oh,taking another swig.

20:48.610 --> 20:49.990
Hang on,hang on.

20:50.140 --> 20:53.720
I think he's going in,flynn. I don't like the way he looks.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.910
Meet you inside.--I'll see you inside.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.700
Someone call 911!

21:07.630 --> 21:08.710
He's gonna kill him!

21:08.750 --> 21:10.580
Kill who ?--Walter!

21:13.550 --> 21:15.040
Come on!Call the police!

21:16.310 --> 21:17.490
Mr. Bivas!

21:17.610 --> 21:20.300
Put the knife down!Get on the floor!

21:20.360 --> 21:21.620
He's trying to kill me!

21:21.700 --> 21:23.320
All right,just stay calm,sir.

21:23.390 --> 21:24.420
Mr. Bivas,

21:24.460 --> 21:27.940
I said put down your knife.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.520
It's not mine.It's his.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.740
He has the same knives.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.120
I don't care!

21:32.200 --> 21:34.370
Put the knife down,now!

21:34.430 --> 21:35.610
And he hated karen.

21:35.690 --> 21:36.870
You murdered my wife!

21:36.980 --> 21:40.420
Shoot him! Shoot him!

21:40.490 --> 21:41.900
Listen to me,mr. Bivas.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.510
Mr. Bivas,listen to me!

21:44.590 --> 21:46.380
Drop that knife.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.490
Confess.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.020
I didn't do anything.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.950
Liar! Stay back!

21:52.030 --> 21:53.800
Son,I am too old to fight you,

21:53.840 --> 21:56.520
so if you don't put that knife down at the count of 5,

21:56.630 --> 21:58.400
I'm going to shoot you dead.

21:58.810 --> 22:00.220
One...

22:00.870 --> 22:01.570
2...

22:01.610 --> 22:02.700
make him confess first!

22:02.770 --> 22:05.140
I don't negotiate. 4...

22:12.250 --> 22:14.150
now, turn around.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.780
We should've shot them both.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.210
Hi. Um...

22:40.530 --> 22:42.740
sorry about earlier.

22:43.390 --> 22:45.680
I just want you to know that
nothing would make me happier

22:45.710 --> 22:47.740
than putting dennis dutton behind bars.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.420
Oh. Well,

22:49.460 --> 22:51.460
I might be wrong about that.

22:51.730 --> 22:54.020
It's possible i'm overreacting

22:54.060 --> 22:56.320
but I still think his alibi stinks.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.650
Have you eaten anything today ?

22:59.870 --> 23:03.470
Because it occurs to me that this is
actually a special occasion for you.

23:03.510 --> 23:05.780
And I thought you might be hungry.

23:06.510 --> 23:10.320
Oh! You shouldn't have done that.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.960
This is mama's kitchen, the
best southern food in L.A.

23:13.050 --> 23:16.400
And considering how dangerous going
out to eat has suddenly become...

23:17.590 --> 23:19.310
oh, nice flowers. From fritz ?

23:19.660 --> 23:22.870
yeah. I just don't know where to put these.

23:23.590 --> 23:25.100
I could never send flowers to estelle.

23:25.140 --> 23:26.640
She's allergic to...

23:27.320 --> 23:28.530
well, everything.

23:28.670 --> 23:31.850
Maybe I'll send her a nice bouquet to
celebrate when the divorce is final.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.520
It's amazing how fast you can go from...

23:37.290 --> 23:40.510
from being partners to adversaries.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.000
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

23:45.580 --> 23:48.270
Oh, here...
I almost forgot.

23:48.540 --> 23:50.090
- Happy birthday.
- Oh!

23:51.150 --> 23:52.870
You didn't have to do that! I...

23:53.800 --> 23:59.470
just consider it an apology for all
the times i forgot your birthday when...

24:00.610 --> 24:02.480
when it might have counted for something.

24:03.550 --> 24:05.250
You don't need to apologize.

24:07.330 --> 24:08.950
I think I do.

24:09.930 --> 24:11.550
Karma's a bitch.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.590
And her name is estelle.

24:15.750 --> 24:19.110
And look, we haven't
had dinner together in

24:19.970 --> 24:21.036
I don't know how long.

24:21.244 --> 24:25.571
This is not exactly
chez paul, I know, but...

24:26.270 --> 24:28.660
- Excuse me.
- Commander.

24:28.750 --> 24:29.780
What's up ?

24:33.710 --> 24:34.510
Yeah, yeah.

24:34.620 --> 24:37.697
the chef and the fellow flint roughed out.

24:37.732 --> 24:40.200
They're through processing
ready for questioning

24:40.320 --> 24:42.870
Thank you very much. That's great.

24:43.630 --> 24:46.270
Well, pardon me.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.370
Thanks for going to so much trouble.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.510
some take-out here.
You should help yourself, commander.

24:59.540 --> 25:02.580
It'll be stone cold by the time I get back.

25:02.670 --> 25:04.140
Thank you.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.970
Is that, fried okra ?

25:12.600 --> 25:14.270
Have a seat.

25:24.630 --> 25:25.950
How about we put these...

25:25.990 --> 25:28.035
oh, thank you, buzz. Thank you.

25:28.070 --> 25:31.910
Just leave them alone.
No one touches these flowers, ok ?

25:32.700 --> 25:33.990
- Yes,ma'am.
- Thank you.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.080
You must know i intend to press
charges against the police.

25:49.470 --> 25:53.020
Well, mr. Lasalle, my detectives
certainly wish they hadn't hurt you

25:53.055 --> 25:54.620
in the process of saving your life...

25:54.690 --> 25:57.320
yeah, we're all broken
up about it, you creep.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.148
But we have some information about
your relationship with the bivases

26:01.149 --> 26:02.605
that we have to follow up on.

26:02.610 --> 26:04.060
What sort of information ?

26:04.100 --> 26:05.747
Well, we're trying to figure out

26:05.748 --> 26:08.848
why chef paul tried to kill
you after his wife was murdered

26:08.930 --> 26:10.870
which leads me to a delicate question.

26:10.910 --> 26:13.940
It's regarding an affair
that you had with karen.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.720
Am i under investigation ?
Well, I suppose I am.

26:17.790 --> 26:23.412
You people are amazing. That animal came
into my restaurant and tried to kill me!

26:23.510 --> 26:27.760
Last night, after her husband left
karen stayed late to do the books.

26:27.780 --> 26:33.310
She made a lovely dinner for 2
and then something went terribly wrong.

26:33.340 --> 26:34.820
Oh! Quelle horreur!

26:35.820 --> 26:38.350
And this was a woman with
whom you were having an affair.

26:39.590 --> 26:42.575
The affaire, as you are referring to it

26:42.850 --> 26:45.210
was 4 years ago and lasted maybe 6 weeks.

26:45.350 --> 26:46.610
And if paul knew about it

26:46.670 --> 26:50.065
it certainly didn't prevent
him from coming to work for me.

26:51.310 --> 26:54.050
Are you saying you hired him when
you were carrying on with his wife ?

26:54.810 --> 27:00.600
No. She stopped carrying on with me
the day after i gave paul the job.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.380
I'm certain it's the only reason
she slept with me to begin with..

27:03.460 --> 27:04.660
stupid cow.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.430
But so what ? Who cares ? Life goes on.

27:06.470 --> 27:10.402
But this notion that karen was cooking
up a romantic late-night dinner for 2

27:10.437 --> 27:13.620
It's absurd. Because the woman
could barely crack an egg.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.750
- Excuse me.
- Oh, she knew about food

27:17.910 --> 27:20.674
of course and the business, but cooking ?

27:20.675 --> 27:23.630
Even I would be better in
the kitchen than she was.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.500
You're saying that neither
you nor karen cooked.

27:28.590 --> 27:31.787
But the knife that chef
paul was holding to your neck

27:31.788 --> 27:34.763
when my detectives arrived-that
was from your set. Was it not ?

27:34.930 --> 27:37.052
Yes. But I never use them.

27:37.087 --> 27:37.915
Well, then why did you buy them ?

27:37.950 --> 27:42.221
I didn't. It was a gift
from one of my investors.

27:43.310 --> 27:45.600
- Dennis dutton ?
- Voila.

27:45.980 --> 27:47.930
I introduced him to karen.

27:48.020 --> 27:51.510
And he stole her away from
me in more ways than one.

27:51.545 --> 27:54.360
I can assure you...
I tell you I was...

27:54.400 --> 27:58.630
and by the way, he gave them knives as well.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.170
That man is knife happy.

28:06.370 --> 28:08.305
She said not to touch her flowers

28:08.340 --> 28:10.590
I'm not touching her flowers.
I'm touching the basket.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.880
She didn't say leave
the basket alone, did she ?

28:16.810 --> 28:18.950
- Now you're reading her card.
- Shut up, buzz.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.665
You see a stamp ? She's been a nut
job ever since these flowers arrived

28:22.700 --> 28:24.194
and I want to know why.

28:28.723 --> 28:30.949
This also explains why she's off sugar.

28:30.984 --> 28:36.798
" Happy Birthday! You're 40 years young,
and I love you. "

28:37.689 --> 28:40.259
Fritz.

28:40.740 --> 28:43.250
I kept my sexual relationship with karen

28:43.280 --> 28:45.093
a secret because i knew if you found out

28:45.128 --> 28:47.501
I'd been sleeping with a murder
victim, you'd be suspicious.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.680
Did paul know you were having
non-romantic sex with his wife ?

28:50.710 --> 28:53.490
- We were discrete.
- And this arrangement ended ?

28:54.600 --> 28:57.160
The moment I executed the wire
transfer that financed chez paul.

28:57.300 --> 29:02.830
So, it sounds to me less like anonymous sex
and more like a dutton paying to get laid.

29:03.970 --> 29:08.350
I never pay for sex.
I don't have to pay for sex.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.700
I could introduce you to about 100 women

29:10.850 --> 29:13.670
who'd pay me to have sex
with them. You stupid bitch.

29:13.770 --> 29:17.290
She was using me.
She used me to help her husband.

29:17.310 --> 29:20.140
Oh, you're so angry, dennis.

29:27.530 --> 29:32.790
Is there something romantic
about ceramic knives ?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.225
Because you bought walter lasalle

29:35.260 --> 29:39.860
and paul bivas a set,and we were wondering
if maybe you bought yourself a set, too.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.870
They're presents for the opening
nights of their restaurants.

29:44.530 --> 29:47.920
Listen to me. I have nothing
to gain by karen's death.

29:48.670 --> 29:53.380
In fact, her business sense was so
key to the success of that restaurant

29:53.410 --> 29:56.390
that I tried to get her to
change her insurance policy.

29:56.630 --> 29:58.370
Yeah, she had it going to her husband.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.860
I wanted it to go to chez paul.

30:00.220 --> 30:04.430
Because I felt that without karen
the restaurant might go to pieces.

30:05.690 --> 30:08.250
All the life insurance is in the bivas name.

30:08.350 --> 30:11.465
In fact, karen just increased
her benefit to her husband.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.980
If his wife dies the chef
settlement is in the 7-figures.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.335
Double that if she's
the victim of a homicide.

30:18.172 --> 30:21.560
So, dennis has no motive and an alibi.

30:21.561 --> 30:25.728
And paul bivas has multi-million
dollar pay-off and an unfaithful wife.

30:25.763 --> 30:27.179
What do we do now ?

30:28.272 --> 30:31.105
well, first I need a
complete list of everything

30:31.106 --> 30:33.914
that was served at I'amboise and
chez paul over the past 2 weeks.

30:33.949 --> 30:35.279
- And then ?
- And then

30:35.314 --> 30:37.626
we're going to have to send
this crime back to the chef.

30:42.885 --> 30:46.157
- Thank you.
- Oh, I still can't get used to the pink.

30:46.192 --> 30:47.854
Well, it's supposed to
have a calming effect.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.816
Just imagine how much worse
it would be without it.

30:49.851 --> 30:52.813
Please! I don't want to be in here.

30:52.848 --> 30:55.940
Please let me out! Let me out!

30:56.994 --> 30:59.208
- Let me out.
- Mr. Bivas, I'm sorry to intrude

30:59.243 --> 31:03.109
but I need to know what the specials were
at your restaurant the night your wife died.

31:03.144 --> 31:04.864
What difference does it make ?

31:05.526 --> 31:07.973
We had a steak and a chicken
and a fish like always!

31:08.008 --> 31:09.516
Now let me out of here, please!

31:09.551 --> 31:12.684
Or go away! Go away!

31:12.719 --> 31:16.794
I can't away go away,mr. Bivas. There's
some things in life you can't send packin'.

31:16.829 --> 31:20.303
That you have to face up to. And
right now, for you, that thing is me.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.880
Now, you're under arrest for
assault and attempted murder.

31:25.881 --> 31:28.705
A homicide charge might not be far behind.

31:28.740 --> 31:32.163
We found your wife's life
insurance policy Mr. Bivas.

31:32.164 --> 31:35.049
And you are a very,very rich man.

31:37.892 --> 31:38.982
What ?

31:39.154 --> 31:43.019
But you won't be able to spend a
multi-million dollar benefit in here.

31:43.054 --> 31:44.841
Now, this is what i want you to do.

31:44.891 --> 31:48.791
Paul, look at me. Face me!
Paul, look up!

31:50.145 --> 31:53.069
Good. Now, answer my questions.

31:54.202 --> 31:56.857
Did you go to l'amboise's last night

31:57.015 --> 31:59.373
because you thought that walter
lasalle murdered your wife

31:59.374 --> 32:03.273
or because you found out that
walter had been sleeping with her ?

32:05.591 --> 32:08.437
Surely you knew about the affair
that karen had with walter.

32:08.472 --> 32:10.829
It's how you got your job at l'amboise'S.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.340
Were you planning on going
after Mr. Dutton next ?

32:14.184 --> 32:15.911
Dennis dutton ?

32:17.181 --> 32:20.441
Karen slept with him to get
money for your restaurant.

32:20.476 --> 32:22.395
She was acting as if you were her pimp.

32:24.292 --> 32:27.086
Are you telling me you
didn't know about this ?

32:29.549 --> 32:30.752
No.

32:34.396 --> 32:37.949
Karen told me that all those wonderful
things happened to me because...

32:38.239 --> 32:40.066
'cause I was so talented.

32:41.479 --> 32:42.887
People wanted me.

32:43.832 --> 32:45.297
That's how muchshe loved me.

32:47.003 --> 32:48.686
That she did those things...

32:50.363 --> 32:52.102
because she loved me so much.

33:21.752 --> 33:23.940
Do we have the menu from l'amboise's ?

33:24.175 --> 33:26.439
Yeah, and a list of
contents from their kitchen.

33:26.474 --> 33:27.667
No ostrich.

33:27.702 --> 33:30.410
And when I asked lasalle if
he ever served it, he laughed.

33:30.744 --> 33:35.533
The chef had the knives, the insurance,
and his wife was screwing around on him.

33:35.568 --> 33:37.233
That's worth a 5-star rating.

33:37.268 --> 33:40.826
Yeah, well, I'm not sure he knew
about the insurance or the affairs.

33:40.861 --> 33:43.423
Well, Mr. Lasalle had a lot of motive.

33:43.458 --> 33:45.709
His restaurant was failing, falling apart.

33:45.744 --> 33:48.262
And he got he same knives
and he was boning her, too.

33:48.297 --> 33:51.517
Yeah, but he doesn't cook.
Could be lyin'.

33:51.552 --> 33:54.839
- Which leaves us with dennis dutton.
- Also boning her.

33:54.874 --> 33:57.005
We all know how he takes rejection.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.799
He doesn't cook either, and he had an alibi.

33:59.834 --> 34:03.535
Except...
wait a minute. Wait.

34:04.391 --> 34:07.698
Did you ever find dennis
dutton's fingerprints

34:07.699 --> 34:09.715
on those wine bottles in newman's trash ?

34:10.205 --> 34:11.388
No, ma'am, sorry.

34:11.523 --> 34:17.172
Sergeant gabriel, how many stores in
the area do you think sell ostrich meat ?

34:17.458 --> 34:19.110
We can find out. Why ?

34:19.145 --> 34:23.333
Because I think i realize how
to break dennis dutton's alibi.

34:23.368 --> 34:26.496
- Chief, what are you doing ?
- I'm looking at the stars.

34:28.435 --> 34:30.958
Very nice of you to ask me out to lunch.

34:30.994 --> 34:35.003
Oh, thank you so much for agreeing to
speak with me again about the murder.

34:40.572 --> 34:42.748
I know how irritating it must be to be asked

34:42.748 --> 34:44.473
the same questions
over and over again.

34:44.507 --> 34:46.579
But if I could get rid of this alibi

34:46.614 --> 34:49.347
that you've arranged with dennis
dutton, I could make my arrest.

34:49.704 --> 34:52.993
- It's not arranged...
- please, just let me finish.

34:53.027 --> 34:54.889
Because I have all this evidence...

34:54.924 --> 34:56.908
how could you have evidence against dennis

34:56.943 --> 34:58.984
when he was with me when karen was murdered ?

34:59.019 --> 35:02.711
Because the knife that was
used to kill karen bivas...

35:02.746 --> 35:05.248
dennis gives knives just like
it to every chef he knows.

35:05.654 --> 35:08.671
But more important than that
dennis was sleeping with the victim.

35:09.753 --> 35:12.290
What ? Ok, well, now you're just lying.

35:12.325 --> 35:16.912
No. No, I'm not.
He-he-he told me so himself.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.274
Dennis told you that he had sex with karen ?

35:19.309 --> 35:22.651
Well, first he told me that she
had slept with walter lasalle.

35:22.701 --> 35:26.703
That was to get her husband
hired as the chef here.

35:26.815 --> 35:29.951
But then, dennis admitted
that karen threw her legs

35:29.986 --> 35:32.370
up in the air to get him
to invest in chez paul.

35:33.530 --> 35:37.625
Just look at how angry dennis is
talking about the way she used him.

35:40.267 --> 35:44.209
She was using me! She used
me to help her husband!

35:44.463 --> 35:46.846
Oh, you're so angry, dennis.

35:46.881 --> 35:49.890
See. Karen wasn't a slut.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.796
She was very selective in that sense.

35:54.886 --> 35:58.575
She chose her lovers for
what they could do for her.

36:00.202 --> 36:05.196
All right. All right. All right.

36:06.305 --> 36:11.580
Dennis-ooh... was not at my house
during the time of the murder.

36:11.648 --> 36:14.006
And you didn't see him again
after he left the restaurant ?

36:16.214 --> 36:18.255
- No.
- And you'll sign a sworn statement

36:18.290 --> 36:20.770
- to that effect ?
- I will.

36:25.886 --> 36:30.928
Of course, considering that walter
and dennis had already given karen

36:30.929 --> 36:33.846
what she wanted, obviously. because
she stopped having sex with them

36:33.881 --> 36:35.126
I started to ask myself

36:35.127 --> 36:39.733
on whom else might she use this
unconventional business plan of hers.

36:39.768 --> 36:44.856
Thank you. Now that she had chez paul
what did karen need next ?

36:44.891 --> 36:48.250
And the answer is a rave review.

36:49.672 --> 36:51.332
Excuse me, are you...

36:51.390 --> 36:54.179
are you suggesting that I traded
my review with karen bivas for sex ?

36:54.214 --> 36:55.847
No. That's what she did.

36:56.082 --> 36:58.158
You traded your review for love.

37:02.678 --> 37:05.278
Thank you. Thank you very much.

37:14.131 --> 37:17.701
- This is not what I ordered.
- No, it's what you made.

37:19.256 --> 37:23.163
Ostrich medallions with chanterelle
mushrooms and white asparagus.

37:23.198 --> 37:26.941
Karen's last meal. She didn't have
time to digest it all before she died.

37:28.381 --> 37:31.763
So I went to all 3 stores in
the city that carry ostrich meat.

37:31.798 --> 37:32.816
And if you push play again

37:32.817 --> 37:35.359
you can catch a video of yourself
buying 2 pounds of it the night

37:35.375 --> 37:36.367
that karen was murdered.

37:36.368 --> 37:41.338
And here is a receipt for
a set of ceramic knives...

37:42.104 --> 37:44.732
the ones used by only the very best chefs.

37:44.767 --> 37:47.228
The same knives used to kill karen bivas.

37:47.263 --> 37:48.794
And now, thanks to your sworn statement,

37:48.795 --> 37:51.393
you no longer have an alibi
for the night of the murder.

37:53.986 --> 37:55.508
This is ridiculous. I should leave.

37:55.543 --> 37:58.910
Well, you could do that, but then I won't
get a chance to tell you your options.

37:59.255 --> 38:02.743
Because the fact that you brought the murder
weapons with you

38:02.744 --> 38:06.493
that looks like premeditation.
And that's first degree murder.

38:06.528 --> 38:10.637
But if you acted in the heat of passion,
if there were mitigating circumstances

38:10.752 --> 38:12.466
I can help you.

38:12.827 --> 38:14.397
You sit there and make all
these accusations against me ?

38:14.398 --> 38:16.064
Now you say you can
help me. What can you do ?

38:16.678 --> 38:20.462
I believe karen acted like
she really cared about you.

38:20.497 --> 38:25.071
I believe that you told your
wife you were in love with karen.

38:25.306 --> 38:26.950
That's why your wife left you, isn't it ?

38:29.292 --> 38:32.764
Yes. Of course.

38:35.998 --> 38:37.730
Karen told me all she
needed was a reputation

38:37.731 --> 38:39.611
of her own to help me set up a restaurant.

38:40.870 --> 38:43.802
And an adult chef with depth
and real talent like me.

38:43.837 --> 38:46.729
Not a child she had to watch
every minute of the day and...

38:47.242 --> 38:48.977
karen loved my food.

38:49.785 --> 38:54.690
She did. She did.

38:57.508 --> 39:00.479
- How could I know ?
- How could you know

39:00.514 --> 39:02.647
it all about the review ?

39:03.081 --> 39:04.768
You compromised your professional life

39:04.780 --> 39:06.786
and threw away your personal one for what ?

39:06.821 --> 39:08.042
For a fantasy.

39:08.077 --> 39:11.983
The reality was karen
loved paul and no one else.

39:12.299 --> 39:14.288
Everything she did was for him.

39:15.751 --> 39:18.438
And that's what you found
out the night before last.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.931
And that's why you killed her. Isn't it ?

39:21.066 --> 39:24.726
Don't you need to read me my rights ?

39:26.013 --> 39:27.387
No.

39:28.715 --> 39:31.851
No, we're in a non-custodial situation.
You can leave anytime you want.

39:32.196 --> 39:35.181
But it's better for you to
get it all over with now.

39:36.170 --> 39:37.354
Tell me...

39:37.996 --> 39:41.947
did you go to chez paul that
night to end a life or start one ?

39:41.982 --> 39:43.982
Because if you acted spontaneously

39:43.983 --> 39:46.729
I could file charges of second
degree murder with the D.A.

39:46.764 --> 39:49.641
Which allows for the possibility of parole.

39:54.049 --> 39:55.948
What happened...

39:58.705 --> 40:03.387
what I did to karen was horrible.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.121
I went home, and I got drunk.

40:07.335 --> 40:09.785
Then I decided to try and make
the next day as normal as possible.

40:09.820 --> 40:12.416
So I called dennis to thank
him for dinner, and he was...

40:12.910 --> 40:15.517
completely freaked out
about the murder, so...

40:17.476 --> 40:19.495
I offered myself as an alibi.

40:21.968 --> 40:24.146
He said he'd help me
open up my own restaurant.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.751
Then we agreed on a story.

40:31.402 --> 40:33.273
Before you stabbed her to death,

40:33.439 --> 40:35.528
you punched her in the mouth.

40:36.716 --> 40:38.810
What'd she say to set you off ?

40:39.962 --> 40:41.754
I told her I loved her.

40:44.923 --> 40:46.933
Then she laughed at me.

40:52.740 --> 40:55.655
After that I don't
really remember very well.

41:05.147 --> 41:07.559
Someone left this in the
electronics room for you.

41:09.461 --> 41:10.606
Thank you, buzz.

41:29.497 --> 41:31.572
Dennis dutton.

41:36.541 --> 41:37.694
- Chief ?
- Yes.

41:43.385 --> 41:46.032
Sorry it's a day late, but
we couldn't agree on a gift.

41:48.195 --> 41:52.339
This is just y'all's way of trying to get
sugar back in the business room, isn't it.

41:52.374 --> 41:53.409
Yes.

41:59.795 --> 42:01.396
Make a wish.

42:16.071 --> 42:18.065
Thank y'all so much.

42:18.100 --> 42:21.246
So nice of you to think of me.

42:21.343 --> 42:22.941
Thank you.

42:24.531 --> 42:26.190
So...

42:32.947 --> 42:34.989
y'all grab a bite.

42:43.765 --> 42:45.518
Guess she didn't get her wish.

42:46.151 --> 42:49.787
- How do you know ?
- 'Cause you're still here.

42:55.461 --> 42:56.477
You see...

42:57.422 --> 43:01.615
turning 40 isn't so bad. All depends
on how you feel about life in general.

43:01.754 --> 43:05.636
Do you see the glass as
half full or half empty ?

43:05.704 --> 43:07.428
What glass ?

43:08.948 --> 43:10.929
That's my girl.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.843
I'm going to put these in car while
you get the rest of your stuff.

43:17.878 --> 43:21.413
Ok. I'll be there in one second.
