WEBVTT

00:29.562 --> 00:31.664
Listen, maybe over
in the corner.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.769
Maybe omelets or --

00:35.869 --> 00:37.837
Oh, maybe by the window.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.775
My love, you've done
omelets already.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.347
I think there may be
actual people in this thing.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.383
No, I think the corner
was a better way to go.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.855
Oh, there
must be something.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.290
Oh, French onion soup?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.859
Well, it is scrumptious,
but it's rather complicated

00:59.926 --> 01:01.961
and gives you terrible gas.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.630
It gives you
terrible gas.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.698
Not there, there.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.100
Hmm.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.135
Those chocolate soufflés --
they're so glamorous,

01:09.235 --> 01:11.938
but they don't seem
very practical, do they?

01:12.038 --> 01:15.975
Even for me, it's a roll
of the dice it'll even rise.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.744
Oh, that'll do.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.315
There, that's just
about perfect.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.086
Vichyssoise?

01:26.152 --> 01:28.388
No.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.789
Oh, I like that.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.991
And just in time.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.593
Hmm.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.728
Oh.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.898
Look at you, Mr. Man.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.003
All perspired
and pungent.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.573
I'll need to get you to carry
appliances more often.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.743
Coq au vin.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.278
What about it?

01:52.345 --> 01:53.680
Coq au vin.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.615
Well, it's certainly classic
French country cooking.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.684
And if you recall,
it was the first recipe

01:57.784 --> 01:59.953
that Judith made
for the master in manuscript.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.254
Well, then?

02:01.321 --> 02:03.756
Coq au vin it is.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.458
Hmm.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.628
Shall we give it a whirl?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.704
Hmm.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.305
<i>...coming up early.</i>

02:19.372 --> 02:22.308
<i>In other news, Boston is...</i>

02:34.487 --> 02:35.722
Hello?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.223
<i> Is that</i>
<i>my baby's voice?</i>

02:37.323 --> 02:39.225
<i>I hardly recognize it,</i>
<i>it's been so long.</i>

02:39.325 --> 02:42.162
Actually, now is not really
a good time.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.197
I'm cooking.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.798
<i>if you don't want</i>
<i>to talk to me,</i>

02:45.865 --> 02:47.400
<i>just tell me straight.</i>
<i>You don't have to lie.</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:49.536
No, Mom,
I'm serious.

02:49.636 --> 02:53.740
I'm -- I'm actually making
a French omelet.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.342
<i>Well!</i>
<i>Look at you!</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:02.549
We should have gone
to Savenor's.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.851
It does all seem
rather past its prime.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.253
<i>Don't tell me you're</i>
<i>going to use dried herbs.</i>

03:07.353 --> 03:10.056
The whole point is to cook
with what is available

03:10.156 --> 03:11.591
to most American women.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.560
Oh!
I weep for them.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.695
But we're taking them
on a journey, Paul.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.430
We can't start
at the finish line.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.432
Even the wine?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.935
You can be in charge
of the wine.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.442
How did you and Judith
finally get Paul on board?

03:29.542 --> 03:32.212
He thinks the whole thing
is his idea.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.113
Oh, for heaven's sake!

03:35.615 --> 03:37.217
Oh!

03:37.283 --> 03:38.785
Men.

03:43.923 --> 03:46.226
Bernard was no different.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.094
You know, our anniversary
next Friday

03:48.194 --> 03:49.295
would have been 40 years.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.531
Gosh, 40.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.699
Doesn't seem plausible.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.901
What can I say?
I was a child bride.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.738
And a very happy
one, too.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.206
Hmm.

04:00.273 --> 04:03.643
And that's the last dead-husband
mention for the month.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.877
Hmm.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.151
Will you join us?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.486
Where? Join what?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.955
The show.
I could use another ally.

04:16.055 --> 04:20.159
<i>And somehow I -- I envision</i>
<i>a confederacy of women,</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:21.961
an estrogen safety net.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
Well, I like
the sound of that.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.170
As long as I don't
have to eat anything.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.172
Ha!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.644
Sorry, it's a bit chaotic
back here.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.185
Oh, my God, am I tired.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.154
You know what? Maybe we should
do this another time.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.356
No, no, no, let's just
get it over with.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.125
So, what do you
got for me, Morash?

04:52.191 --> 04:53.526
Give me
the Italian version.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.162
I have a hot bath at home,
waiting for me to soak in.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.830
Uh, oh, okay.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.866
Well, uh, thank you,
Hunter, for the time,

04:59.966 --> 05:01.701
especially with everything
going on.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.169
Look, I-I know I brought you

05:03.269 --> 05:05.104
a bunch of ideas before,
but I think --

05:05.171 --> 05:08.207
I think you're gonna have a hard
time saying no to this one.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.643
I'm all ears, leaning in.

05:12.712 --> 05:17.116
Uh, t-this is Roger Fisher,
the -- the preeminent mind

05:17.183 --> 05:19.886
on the art of negotiation
for this entire country.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.821
Oh.

05:21.888 --> 05:22.855
What are you, his mother?

05:22.955 --> 05:25.058
I'll shut up now.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.727
Why talk when I have a genius
right beside me?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.495
Roger?

05:29.562 --> 05:32.031
Um, well,

05:32.131 --> 05:34.734
it's called
"The Advocate."

05:34.834 --> 05:39.539
We start with
a decidable question.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.175
This éclair
is to die for.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.143
Well, last time,
I brought you a cake.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.912
I had to one-up it
somehow.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.416
I'm trying to stay on top
of everything,

05:50.516 --> 05:53.052
but a cooking show
is a mammoth undertaking.

05:53.152 --> 05:54.921
I'm only now starting
to realize that.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.091
Well, it's not a show yet.
It's just a pilot.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.927
Oh, yes, of course.
Of course.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.428
I'm daydreaming.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.930
I can't help it.

06:04.030 --> 06:04.931
I understand.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.166
I'm a daydreamer myself.

06:07.233 --> 06:12.004
Now, I have called Mr. Morash
a few times to get his advice.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.573
Hasn't called back.

06:13.673 --> 06:14.941
What a surprise.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.276
<i>Which makes me doubly</i>
<i>appreciative of you finding time</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:20.213
in what I'm sure
is a very busy schedule.

06:20.279 --> 06:24.083
Yeah, about Russ, uh,
are you --

06:24.183 --> 06:27.754
are you sure you don't want
one of your éclairs?

06:27.854 --> 06:29.288
Oh, dear.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.923
That bad.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.127
Well
he had this passion project

06:34.227 --> 06:35.962
that our boss passed
on this morning.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.196
He really believed in it.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.065
He really thought
it was the one.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.867
It's too bad.
It's a great idea.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.636
But, of course, I also think
you're a great idea.

06:43.736 --> 06:44.737
And he doesn't?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.806
He doesn't,
as I think you know.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.074
Hmm.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.442
He's doubly low
right now.

06:49.542 --> 06:54.280
Low and resentful,
so bad just got worse.

06:57.884 --> 06:58.985
<i> Voilà, madame.</i>

06:59.085 --> 07:00.153
Merci, Louie.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.722
<i>De rien.</i>

07:02.789 --> 07:04.056
Thank you.

07:08.494 --> 07:09.729
Well...

07:10.596 --> 07:13.332
To my sparkling jewel
as she embarks

07:13.433 --> 07:15.768
on her most exciting
voyage yet.

07:15.835 --> 07:16.936
Hear, hear.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.571
Maybe this time,
you'll watch.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.509
Darling, you alright?

07:24.644 --> 07:26.012
Well, to be frank,

07:26.112 --> 07:28.648
not everyone
shares your enthusiasm.

07:28.748 --> 07:29.849
Nonsense. Who?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.350
You are the co-author
of the definitive book

07:31.451 --> 07:32.752
on French cooking.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.520
Not according
to Russ Morash,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.956
director fellow from
"I've Been Reading."

07:37.023 --> 07:39.158
He probably thinks
I'm a middle-aged dilettante

07:39.258 --> 07:40.860
with looks for radio.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.628
Julia.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.998
You, my dear,
doing this is genius.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.167
Hear, hear.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.603
this little plot is genius.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.840
<i>And this Morash fellow sounds</i>
<i>positively philistine.</i>

07:53.940 --> 07:56.309
And women are going to lose
their fucking minds.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.810
I think men will, too,

07:57.877 --> 07:59.545
because of
the enological aspect.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.681
Enological, Paul?
Really.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.049
Is there another
word for it?

08:03.149 --> 08:04.050
Several.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.185
You see, that
lovely Alice Naman

08:06.285 --> 08:07.520
called me earlier.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.790
And it seems Mr. Morash
is not my ally.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.326
He feels rather above
our little enterprise,

08:13.392 --> 08:16.062
and I daresay
he's even tried to kill it.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.831
She implied that I needed
to win him over somehow

08:18.898 --> 08:21.300
if we fancy
moving forward.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.035
Hmm.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.737
But how do you charm a man

08:24.837 --> 08:27.306
who does not find you
in the least charming?

08:43.756 --> 08:44.924
You summoned me?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.392
Summoned?

08:46.492 --> 08:48.694
It was more like
a friendly invitation.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.902
Would you like a towel?

08:56.002 --> 08:57.770
Towel?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.438
You're quite damp.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.607
No, I'm not. I'm fine.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.782
Oh, thank you.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.118
Listen,
I'm glad you called.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.720
I've been thinking about your
desire to do a cooking show,

09:14.787 --> 09:16.355
but I'm afraid --

09:16.422 --> 09:19.525
Huh?

09:19.592 --> 09:22.428
Can I entice you
to try it?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.034
Allow me.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.936
Oh, yeah.

09:30.036 --> 09:34.140
I daresay we got off
on the wrong foot.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.710
To have a man as intellectually
curious as you

09:37.777 --> 09:40.112
producing my little show is
an embarrassment of riches.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.782
Well, thank you.
I couldn't agree more.

09:42.882 --> 09:46.052
But I thought if you knew
more about me...

09:46.118 --> 09:48.054
You know my husband
was a diplomat.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.989
He's a man of letters.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.490
We met in Ceylon.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.125
Let me cut to the chase,
Mrs. Child.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.761
Oh, Julia, please.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.063
But you have to understand

09:57.129 --> 09:58.731
that I am not
a frivolous person.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.266
I may be
in the television industry,

10:00.333 --> 10:02.735
<i>but public television</i>
<i>is not "television" television.</i>

10:02.802 --> 10:05.237
It's not entertainment.
I am not an entertainer.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.739
I'm not entertaining.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.507
Completely.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.675
Sherry?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.844
Now, you --

10:11.944 --> 10:14.513
<i>I-I understand you feel</i>
<i>that what you do has substance,</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:16.282
and maybe to some
ladies of means it does,

10:16.349 --> 10:20.353
<i>but public television</i>
<i>is on a much larger journey.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:22.355
Oh, my God.

10:25.358 --> 10:29.362
<i>Y-You see, I want to change</i>
<i>the way people think,</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:32.098
the way they see,
the way they live their lives.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.633
But so do I.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.202
But how can food
possibly do that?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.703
That's really very good.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.472
Thank you.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.211
It's goose?

11:10.569 --> 11:11.737
Hey, honey!

11:11.837 --> 11:13.072
Hi!

11:19.011 --> 11:21.213
I'm in here.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.648
Tuna casserole?

11:22.715 --> 11:23.816
Your favorite.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.251
Hmm.

11:33.559 --> 11:34.927
Hi. Hi.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.196
Mwah.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.103
Oh.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.671
It's a cookbook.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.440
I see that.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.710
It's the show
I'm producing.

11:50.776 --> 11:51.911
Hmm.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.680
And she talks...
like this.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.782
Like a man trying to sound
like a woman?

11:57.950 --> 11:59.852
Exactly.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.857
I turned down "End Game"
at the Cherry Lane for this?

12:04.924 --> 12:07.526
I could have been in a room
with Samuel Beckett?

12:07.593 --> 12:08.761
Darling.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.596
Oh, I left the theater
to make a wage,

12:10.696 --> 12:12.064
sure, but more than that,

12:12.131 --> 12:14.467
to make a name for myself
in public television.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.037
I-I swear, I went over
to her fancy Cambridge house

12:18.104 --> 12:20.773
to tell her that
in no uncertain terms,

12:20.873 --> 12:21.941
I wasn't gonna do it.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.776
What'd she say?

12:23.876 --> 12:27.113
She somehow twisted
everything around,

12:27.213 --> 12:28.981
and I hardly
got two words in.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.650
Before I knew it,
I was outside in the rain.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.055
Have you ever
tasted foie gras?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.327
I look awful.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.796
You look the same.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.631
Thanks.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.169
Oh, uh, whoa, whoa,
you're going to hurt yourself.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.505
Hey, shh-shh-shh-shh.

13:01.413 --> 13:05.117
The thing is, Paul,
no one's really done it.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.122
How do you do it?

13:10.189 --> 13:11.957
Hmm.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.760
How did I have the nerve
to think I could?

13:17.663 --> 13:19.198
All in time.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.533
What time?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.535
How do you make a 4-hour
dish in 28 minutes?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.537
I haven't the foggiest.
Do you? Do you?!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.539
No, of course you don't.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.873
I'm serious, Paul.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.609
Sure, I made a 2-minute
omelet in 5 minutes,

13:30.676 --> 13:32.711
but how am I going to
make coq au vin in 28?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.880
It cooks in the oven
for over 30 minutes.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.551
We'll figure it out the way
we always do --

13:38.651 --> 13:40.986
together.

13:41.053 --> 13:42.688
Ohh.

13:51.397 --> 13:55.901
You know what takes
less than 28 minutes?

13:57.369 --> 13:59.171
This may not be
the best moment for cuddling.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.842
My feet are ice, and the rest
of the old vessel is inflamed.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.210
And besides,
haven't you noticed?

14:04.310 --> 14:05.978
I'm hideous...

14:06.045 --> 14:07.713
...ancient...

14:07.813 --> 14:10.249
...and distracted.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.719
You're beautiful,
in your prime.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.555
And let me distract you
from your distraction.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.196
<i>No, maybe you should sleep</i>
<i>in your room tonight.</i>

14:31.937 --> 14:34.006
<i>Darling, are you sure</i>
<i>you're quite all right?</i>

14:34.073 --> 14:36.775
Have you been listening
to a word I've said?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.178
No, Paul, I'm not!

14:54.426 --> 14:57.563
I chalk this up
to opening-night jitters.

14:57.630 --> 15:02.968
Just remember, they believe
in you at WGBH.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.471
This is their baby as much
as it is yours.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.873
They've invested time, money.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.075
They came to you.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.646
Good night, my love.
I love you.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.813
<i>à demain.</i>

15:19.418 --> 15:21.220
Oh, Paul.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.491
Paulski, come back.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.077
<i> Hello?</i>

15:45.144 --> 15:47.513
Oh, Judith...

15:47.613 --> 15:50.149
did I wake you?

15:50.249 --> 15:51.951
My concern with Hofstadter
is selling a book

15:52.017 --> 15:54.787
<i>on anti-intellectualism</i>
<i>that's more than 500 pages.</i>

15:54.853 --> 15:56.021
It does seem
a little ironic.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.356
Have you expressed that?

15:57.456 --> 15:58.757
You can't
soft-shoe around it.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.693
She's absolutely
right, Gene.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.096
Are you going to turn
into a pumpkin?

16:04.163 --> 16:05.798
Not quite.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.533
Julia Child
needs me in Boston,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.802
and I'm afraid
I'm not gonna make my train.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.938
Blanche, I was hoping
you'd help a gal out.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.474
<i>I have a lunch with Updike,</i>
<i>and I'd be so grateful</i>

16:15.541 --> 16:16.875
if you'd go in my stead.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.345
You're canceling with
John Updike for Julia Child?

16:19.445 --> 16:20.846
Updike just wants
a free meal, Leo.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.047
Julia's in crisis.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.350
With a cookbook sequel,
right, Judy?

16:24.450 --> 16:25.851
Judith.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.488
something else entirely.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.856
A television pilot.

16:30.956 --> 16:34.159
<i>Oh, a television pilot.</i>
<i>I'll take the lunch, Alfred.</i>

16:34.226 --> 16:36.061
Ha-ha, Avrum.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.296
How's the new one?

16:37.363 --> 16:38.630
Well, thus far, it's not
"Rabbit, Run."

16:38.697 --> 16:39.999
And yet you're
blowing him off.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.200
I'm not blowing him off.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.002
I'd love to sit with him
and kibitz

16:43.068 --> 16:45.704
so he can avoid rolling up
his sleeves and doing the work,

16:45.804 --> 16:48.874
but the truth is, sleeve-rolling
is all that's needed here,

16:48.974 --> 16:50.309
with or without me at lunch.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.511
And yet that's part
of the job -- to motivate,

16:52.578 --> 16:56.915
to inspire, to apply just
the right modicum of pressure.

16:57.016 --> 17:01.754
That's what great editors do,
and you certainly are that.

17:02.654 --> 17:05.090
Help me out here, Blanche.
Please.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.359
Judith...

17:07.426 --> 17:09.328
I need to say this
out loud

17:09.395 --> 17:11.930
so you can
really hear it.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.000
You are asking to
jilt John Updike, who,

17:15.067 --> 17:16.869
in your opinion,
as I am hearing,

17:16.935 --> 17:18.937
is also
in a sort of crisis

17:19.038 --> 17:20.873
for a woman
who wrote a cookbook

17:20.939 --> 17:23.342
with two other women,

17:23.409 --> 17:25.944
trying to get
on local television.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.114
I think
you know my answer.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.626
Oh, you came!

17:40.726 --> 17:42.761
My invisible hand.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.063
What would
I do without you?

17:44.129 --> 17:46.065
Can I use the ladies'?
I'm dying.

17:50.102 --> 17:53.972
Well, then, our task
is a mighty one --

17:54.073 --> 17:56.208
to teach and show
an American home cook

17:56.275 --> 17:57.643
how to make coq au vin,

17:57.743 --> 17:59.978
which takes 4 hours
to make properly,

18:00.079 --> 18:04.650
in 28 uninterrupted
minutes.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.488
I jotted down some thoughts
on the train.

18:09.588 --> 18:13.826
The way I see it, you structure
it like a three-act play.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.328
Act 1, butchering the chicken.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.297
Act 2, adding heat.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.333
Act 3, plating and serving.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.801
Oh! My word.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.505
Aren't I just tickled!

18:26.605 --> 18:28.474
Yes, I'm so happy I had
the "courage"

18:28.574 --> 18:30.576
to invite you to join us.

18:30.642 --> 18:34.446
I'm so happy the timing
worked out so I could be here.

18:34.513 --> 18:35.681
Oh.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.349
Something I was
thinking of last night,

18:37.449 --> 18:39.118
when I couldn't sleep --

18:39.184 --> 18:42.588
subbing out pots and pans
to save time.

18:42.654 --> 18:43.856
Oh!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.190
I think that's right.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.159
Maybe we can pre-prepare
some of the steps.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.260
Oh!

18:48.327 --> 18:49.628
Who is this
nimble genius?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.766
Onions.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.001
Oh, there you go.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.870
Oh, my God.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.104
All of these?

19:10.549 --> 19:16.054
Thank God I married an artist,
rather than a Republican banker.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.723
I'd be even more of a lush.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.957
Ha!

19:20.559 --> 19:22.361
And...action.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.530
And look up this time, Jul.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.564
I'm the camera.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.965
Talk to me.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.568
I'm Julia Child.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.205
Welcome to "The French Chef."

19:33.305 --> 19:37.576
Today we're going to do
coq au vin,

19:37.676 --> 19:41.980
which is French for
"chicken and red wine."

19:45.651 --> 19:46.852
Well done.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.420
That was
absolutely perfect.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.588
It could not be done better.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.923
That was lovely.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.759
Now it's time to brown
the chicken.

19:57.930 --> 20:03.869
Darling, why don't you
try to circle back like this...

20:03.936 --> 20:07.172
and then land
left of the pot?

20:07.239 --> 20:08.407
Hmm.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.542
Yeah.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.078
Darling, I think
it would be more efficient

20:13.178 --> 20:16.215
if we just
kept it as it is.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.449
Well, the version
I'm proposing

20:17.549 --> 20:19.451
really accentuates
your good side.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.421
My good side?

20:24.456 --> 20:28.594
One renders the bacon
to remove the bacon-y taste.

20:30.095 --> 20:33.732
We don't want the bacon
to overwhelm the dish.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.135
You want to really
taste the coq.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.370
Ha!

20:45.644 --> 20:47.980
Ohh, that's Paul's fault.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.982
I wanted to make omelets.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.985
That's it, exactly!

20:53.085 --> 20:55.320
It can't all just be
facts, facts, facts.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.289
There should
be jokes, too.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.757
Oh, absolutely.

21:04.796 --> 21:08.133
Light a match...

21:08.233 --> 21:10.235
stand away...

21:10.302 --> 21:11.837
and let 'er rip.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.505
- Whoo!
- Wow.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.940
Hurray!

21:19.311 --> 21:21.513
Where were we?

21:21.613 --> 21:23.181
Oh, right.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.984
Now we put it in the oven
for 30 minutes.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.665
That's it. Whoa, whoa.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.700
At the end of the episode,

21:41.800 --> 21:45.203
you should leave the kitchen,
go to the table,

21:45.304 --> 21:47.939
and taste
what you've made.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.642
Oh, how marvelous!

21:50.709 --> 21:52.978
I'll call Russ
and take care of it.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.615
Oh!

21:58.317 --> 22:00.552
Oh, this is where I talk
about the wine, correct?

22:00.652 --> 22:02.187
Yes. Finally.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.523
"You can serve this
with a fine young Burgundy."

22:04.623 --> 22:06.558
Mm-hmm.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.126
would get lost
in the robust--"

22:08.193 --> 22:10.195
How are we for time?

22:11.897 --> 22:16.068
I don't think there's room
for this, Paulski.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.503
Kill my darlings,
why don't you?

22:31.683 --> 22:32.851
J-Just mime it.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.253
Hmm?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.755
Ah.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.825
"This is Julia Child.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.927
Thank you for tuning in."

22:42.027 --> 22:43.929
And...cut.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.400
Oh.
Oh, well done, team.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.935
You did it.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.370
You made a show.

22:51.436 --> 22:52.771
- Did I?
- Yeah.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.072
Well...

22:54.172 --> 22:55.707
if I can remember
everything I did right

22:55.774 --> 22:57.209
and forget everything
I did wrong,

22:57.275 --> 23:03.548
then maybe, maybe
<i>we</i> made a show.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.119
And on that note,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.755
I have some reading to do
before bed.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.390
Mwah.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.058
It's 2:00
in the morning.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.559
It's Updike.

23:14.626 --> 23:16.962
Goodness,
is it really 2:00 a.m.?

23:17.896 --> 23:19.698
Thank you, Julia.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.299
Thank you, Mr. Child.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.101
Paul, my dear.

23:23.201 --> 23:24.770
We'll call you a cab.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.707
Come in.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.879
I just wanted
to say good night

23:33.945 --> 23:36.748
and thank you again
for coming all this way,

23:36.815 --> 23:39.584
for giving my little show
your entire day,

23:39.651 --> 23:42.320
with Updike
snapping at your toes.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.722
I know it wasn't easy.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.157
I'm only sorry
I won't be able to see

23:45.257 --> 23:46.658
all your hard work pay off.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.226
Well...

23:48.293 --> 23:49.995
you have more
important things to do

23:50.095 --> 23:55.000
than worry about
the pipe dreams of an amateur.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.505
I'm staying.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.240
What's one more day?

24:02.307 --> 24:04.309
How could I miss this?

24:04.409 --> 24:05.444
And Updike?

24:05.510 --> 24:06.645
Updike be damned.

24:06.745 --> 24:09.014
Oh, thank you, Judith.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.917
Thank you
for caring so much.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.585
It's easy with you.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.921
Yes, well...

24:16.788 --> 24:18.790
Off topic,

24:18.857 --> 24:21.526
how much do you think
Mary Tyler Moore weighs?

24:34.339 --> 24:35.874
Ready when you are.

25:01.566 --> 25:03.735
Oh, Paul.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.251
You aren't ready.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.852
You did know we were
picking you up.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.354
Today's the day.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.090
I'm sorry, honey.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.259
I'm just not up to it
after all.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.661
This is absurd.

25:29.728 --> 25:31.897
40 years.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.331
You understand,
don't you?

25:33.398 --> 25:36.234
I need you with me,
Avis.

25:36.334 --> 25:37.836
I have brought this
all on myself,

25:37.903 --> 25:40.906
<i>all because of some silly whim,</i>
<i>and frankly, I'm terrified.</i>

25:41.006 --> 25:42.607
And besides,

25:42.707 --> 25:47.112
a distraction is exactly
what's called for.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.386
Oh, what a beautiful
bride you were.

25:54.452 --> 25:56.555
<i>You weren't kidding when you</i>
<i>said "child," though.</i>

26:14.306 --> 26:16.808
Hello. Hi.

26:27.886 --> 26:30.221
Let's set that boom pole
for the frame.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.823
Let's set the boom in
for frame.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.126
I don't want to wait
on sound again.

26:35.226 --> 26:37.162
Camera 1, you can be wider.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.331
Manny, you want to see
that move?

26:39.431 --> 26:42.400
Chaz, I need more bounce
on that counter.

26:44.903 --> 26:45.937
There you go.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.772
Well, hello.

26:47.839 --> 26:49.507
This is my husband.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.344
Paul, this is Russ Morash,
the handsome young producer

26:52.444 --> 26:54.245
I was telling you about.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.748
You can have a seat --

26:56.815 --> 26:58.149
You can have a seat
over there.

26:58.249 --> 26:59.918
That'll keep you safely
out of the way.

26:59.985 --> 27:02.654
Oh, I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.523
You should do your hair
and makeup.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.025
I've done
my hair and makeup.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.927
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you look good.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.001
Paul?

27:16.101 --> 27:18.203
Paul?

27:18.303 --> 27:19.938
The kitchen.

27:20.005 --> 27:23.008
Nothing's where
it's supposed to be.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.445
Oh, it never occurred to me.

27:29.114 --> 27:32.283
Oh, tell me this is
not happening.

27:35.286 --> 27:38.189
The stovetop is electric.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.393
All our staging.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.527
Oh, God.

27:42.627 --> 27:44.462
Uh, excuse me.

27:44.529 --> 27:45.563
Excuse me.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.898
We need some time
to recalibrate.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.566
Who should I speak to?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.702
Uh, n-no, no,
that won't do.

27:50.802 --> 27:51.970
Time costs.
Unfortunately,

27:52.037 --> 27:53.238
we're already spread
thinner than a --

27:53.338 --> 27:56.174
Crepe? Crap.

27:57.575 --> 27:59.411
Darling, there's nothing
to be done.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.246
It's a money issue.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.150
Right.

28:06.885 --> 28:09.020
I still see
the boom shadow, Sam.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.659
Adjust the boom.
Thank you.

28:14.726 --> 28:18.663
Benny, let's see
the move one more time.

28:18.730 --> 28:21.166
Again. Thank you.

28:21.232 --> 28:24.769
<i>That's lovely. I'm happy.</i>
<i>One minute to go, everyone!</i>

28:27.872 --> 28:29.674
And you are?

28:29.741 --> 28:32.444
Judith Jones.
I'm Julia's editor at Knopf.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.511
Is that what you're doing?

28:33.578 --> 28:34.913
Editing? Yep.

28:35.013 --> 28:36.347
A new cookbook?

28:36.414 --> 28:38.917
A new Updike.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.185
Oh.

28:40.251 --> 28:42.253
Well, then, I guess
I'll let you be.

28:47.292 --> 28:48.960
Alright, people.
Almost there.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.695
Clear the set, please.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.297
Clearing set.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.906
Is it me
or is it quite warm?

29:02.907 --> 29:03.975
Here.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.778
Oh, thank you.

29:06.878 --> 29:10.148
<i>Okay, so we shoot continuously</i>
<i>for the full duration.</i>

29:10.248 --> 29:13.718
There are three cameras --
there, there, and there --

29:13.785 --> 29:15.286
that I can cut back
and forth with.

29:15.386 --> 29:16.921
This one will come in close

29:16.988 --> 29:18.957
so I can get some tight shots
of the food itself.

29:20.992 --> 29:22.894
<i>Try and ignore Benny.</i>
<i>Pretend he's not there.</i>

29:22.961 --> 29:25.730
And just remember,
I have your back.

29:25.797 --> 29:26.998
I'll handle the talent.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.167
Pardon me?

29:29.267 --> 29:31.136
Yeah, I can
take it from here.

29:39.410 --> 29:40.912
Break a leg.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.413
Oh.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.317
These are not in order,
are they?

29:46.417 --> 29:48.119
No, this is not --

29:50.288 --> 29:52.690
It looks terrific, Russ.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.826
You know what, Al?
Do me a favor.

29:54.926 --> 29:57.929
<i>Go hide behind the counter</i>
<i>in case Mrs. Child needs help.</i>

29:59.464 --> 30:00.698
Oh.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.100
Something the matter?

30:02.167 --> 30:03.768
I just thought
I'd be out front.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.770
Be a sport.
I need you there.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.205
I'll join you.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.706
Team Julia.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.975
Sisterhood.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.944
Who is she?

30:14.145 --> 30:16.214
<i>Excuse me, young man,</i>
<i>I'm handling the cards,</i>

30:16.314 --> 30:17.549
so I think it's imperative

30:17.649 --> 30:19.350
that I should be placed
somewhere up front.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.553
Oh, oh, hey, we have
someone for that.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.888
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you have someone for that?</i>
<i>I'm someone.</i>

30:23.988 --> 30:25.223
We have someone to hold
the cue cards.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.991
You have someone
to hold the cue cards?

30:27.058 --> 30:29.027
That's their job.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.495
Mrs. Child and I
created these together.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.230
I understand --

30:32.330 --> 30:33.865
Ooh, goodness,
he's about to explode.

30:33.965 --> 30:37.202
You need to do something
about this, Alice.

30:37.302 --> 30:40.905
From my powerful position
at your feet?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.640
You're my producer.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.253
Mrs. Child and I
are a team.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.554
We have --

30:56.654 --> 30:57.755
No, they are not
just drawings.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.057
They are cue cards.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.658
Yes? Now what?

31:00.725 --> 31:02.827
It's just -- it's your call,
obviously, but we rehearsed it

31:02.894 --> 31:05.096
this way the other day,
and to my green eyes,

31:05.196 --> 31:08.566
it seems safest to not confuse
Mrs. Child.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.904
Fine.

31:14.505 --> 31:17.275
Al, do me a favor.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.078
Next time,
pull me aside.

31:20.178 --> 31:21.512
Absolutely.

31:21.579 --> 31:22.780
Noted.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.349
Is it me,
or is the room spinning?

31:24.415 --> 31:25.450
I feel I may vomit...

31:25.550 --> 31:26.584
Oh, dear.

31:26.684 --> 31:27.886
...and not for the usual
good reasons.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.587
It's all right.
It's going to be fine.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.022
It's very hot
under the lights.

31:31.089 --> 31:32.790
You're going to be
just fine.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.194
<i>You're going to shine</i>
<i>like the star that you are.</i>

31:36.261 --> 31:37.295
Thank you.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.631
Okay, places,
everyone.

31:39.731 --> 31:44.302
We are ready in five,
four, three, two...

31:55.647 --> 31:57.649
Welcome to "The French Chef."

32:00.118 --> 32:02.153
I'm Julia Child.

32:14.465 --> 32:17.235
I'm neither French nor a chef,
but here I am.

32:17.302 --> 32:20.305
<i>Que sera sera.</i>

32:20.405 --> 32:24.809
Now, today, we're going
to do coq au vin.

32:24.909 --> 32:27.578
That's French for
"chicken and red wine."

32:27.645 --> 32:28.846
It's one of the best,
and I think --

32:31.349 --> 32:35.286
One of the most famous
French chicken dishes.

32:35.353 --> 32:39.324
It will fill your home
with the marvelous aroma

32:39.424 --> 32:42.527
of sizzling bacon and garlic

32:42.627 --> 32:46.698
and herbs and onions
and mushrooms and red wine.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.301
And dare I say, it's just
about the most delicious coq

32:50.368 --> 32:51.936
I've ever put in my mouth.

32:52.003 --> 32:54.339
And that's saying something.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.276
Now...

32:58.343 --> 33:01.946
butchering a chicken --
nothing to be afraid of.

33:02.013 --> 33:08.119
The legs, the wings, the thighs,
and the breasts.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.153
Very simple.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.788
Just stay
out of her way.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.790
That's what
I do with Updike.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.292
...fat.

33:14.359 --> 33:18.696
I like to use a small knife
to -- if I could find one.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.698
Oh, not in there.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.133
Mm.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.568
Where are the knives?

33:23.668 --> 33:24.736
I didn't
place the knives.

33:24.836 --> 33:25.870
Idiot.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.573
Oh, wow,
that doesn't even open.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.009
And, ah, we -- ah!

33:31.075 --> 33:33.211
Yes.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.016
Now, the thing is --

33:38.082 --> 33:41.252
is to cut through...

33:41.352 --> 33:43.588
the ball joint.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.726
No, it's not sharp.

33:52.163 --> 33:53.731
Oh!

33:59.404 --> 34:02.774
Now, if you're alone
in the kitchen,

34:02.874 --> 34:05.610
who's going to see?

34:08.446 --> 34:12.116
And now,
the pièce de résistance.

34:12.216 --> 34:17.622
It's time to flame it in brandy,
to flambé.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.891
I like a nice cognac.

34:19.957 --> 34:22.560
None of that rotgut stuff.

34:22.627 --> 34:25.029
Faster.
A little faster.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.432
Mm.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.633
Ah.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.804
Light a match, stand away,
and let 'er rip.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.238
Ooh!

34:35.573 --> 34:37.041
Rather high, isn't it?

34:37.108 --> 34:40.078
Well, not sure how to quite put
the old tin lid on it.

34:40.144 --> 34:45.049
Ooh, well, as Lady Macbeth
would say,

34:45.116 --> 34:47.718
"Out, out, damn flame.

34:47.785 --> 34:49.654
Take that."

34:49.754 --> 34:50.988
There.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.992
Now, yes, that ought to do it.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.896
Important to taste your food
as you go.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.800
Now, that isn't good at all.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.612
And there you are.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.147
If you were here with me,

35:16.247 --> 35:20.084
you'd know the aroma
is just lovely.

35:20.151 --> 35:22.420
And you can make this ahead
of time, up to this point.

35:22.487 --> 35:25.857
A day ahead of time.
Or two days ahead of time.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.426
Or even three days
ahead of time.

35:30.528 --> 35:32.763
Or even four.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.366
And now I'm going to serve it.

35:42.140 --> 35:46.511
So you can see just
how it will be.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.780
Hello.

35:53.050 --> 35:57.989
And there's a piece
of juicy breast...

35:58.055 --> 36:02.527
and lovely mushrooms.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.836
Mmm.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.241
Yes, that's it.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.243
And that's our program.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.817
Oh, goodness.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.361
You can serve this
with a fine young burgundy.

36:37.428 --> 36:39.397
An old delicate wine
will get lost

36:39.497 --> 36:42.066
in the robustness
of the stew.

36:42.166 --> 36:43.768
A Pinot Noir from out west

36:43.868 --> 36:46.904
could do just the job
if you're in a pinch.

36:47.004 --> 36:49.273
And boeuf bourguignon is made
the exact same way.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.675
Lamb, too.

36:50.741 --> 36:52.877
Of course, you would use beef
instead of chicken.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.178
Or a lamb.

36:54.245 --> 36:57.348
And it's a perfectly delicious
party dish.

36:57.415 --> 37:00.785
And so now you've learned three
recipes for the price of one,

37:00.885 --> 37:04.121
and you can open
your own French restaurant.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.856
Chez...

37:05.923 --> 37:07.959
whatever your name is.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.197
And now that's our program.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.801
I hope you've had as much fun
as I did.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.637
This is Julia Child.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.239
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

37:22.540 --> 37:23.641
And cut.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.981
What a triumph.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.651
Well, this is exactly
what I needed today.

37:41.158 --> 37:43.494
<i>Bon appétit?</i>
Where did that come from?

37:43.594 --> 37:45.329
It's perfect.

37:45.429 --> 37:48.432
You must end
every episode that way.

37:49.634 --> 37:52.169
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.009
Nice knowing you.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.684
Hey.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.519
Are you ashamed of me?

38:08.619 --> 38:10.921
You were
delightful, Julia.

38:10.988 --> 38:12.757
You can't help it.

38:13.991 --> 38:16.427
Well, thank you
for lying.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.195
I know it doesn't
come easily to you.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.998
Julia, no.

38:28.172 --> 38:30.174
Let's get you some air.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.049
Um...

38:40.951 --> 38:45.056
Uh, thank you all, truly.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.858
I'm sorry if I let you down.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.396
Feel free to dig in and enjoy.

38:54.732 --> 38:58.002
I thought the taste was lovely.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.598
Drinks on me, gentlemen.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.334
Or rather, WGBH.

39:30.401 --> 39:31.769
I don't know how
you made it through

39:31.869 --> 39:33.003
with a straight face.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.238
I'm from
the theatre, Chaz.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.273
I'm also a bit
of a card shark.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.009
Ask Roland.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.245
Alice, you'll lock up?

39:41.345 --> 39:43.114
See ya tomorrow.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.653
Stop torturing yourself.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.491
Make a telephone date
with Simca.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.994
Focus on the book.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.329
You have substance.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.665
The book has substance.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.501
That monster...

40:37.601 --> 40:38.936
has no substance.

40:42.506 --> 40:44.241
Maybe you're right.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.848
Not to be incendiary,
that flambéing segment

40:50.948 --> 40:53.250
may just be
your claim to flame.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.353
Ah!

40:56.454 --> 40:58.856
Puns?

40:58.956 --> 41:01.358
<i>It's a perfectly</i>
<i>delicious party dish.</i>

41:01.459 --> 41:04.495
<i>So now you've learned three</i>
<i>recipes for the price of one,</i>

41:04.595 --> 41:06.464
<i>and you can open your own</i>
<i>French re--</i>

41:08.499 --> 41:10.367
We can't air that.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.836
Oh, we're airing it.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.170
What do you mean?

41:13.270 --> 41:14.805
If this is what Fox wants
on his station,

41:14.872 --> 41:16.207
then we have no choice
but to give it to him.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.375
Don't air it to prove
a point, Russ.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.810
Don't humiliate the poor woman.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.779
She paid for it, Alice.
We owe it to her.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.381
The fact that it proves
our point is merely,

41:24.482 --> 41:26.784
as Julia herself
might say...

41:26.851 --> 41:29.053
...icing on the cake.

41:36.894 --> 41:38.395
Get down here!

41:38.496 --> 41:40.064
I'm not coming.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.899
Well, I've popped the Dom.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.702
Really, Paul,
it's too embarrassing.

41:44.802 --> 41:45.870
I'm embarrassed.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.238
Come on, old girl.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.241
You bought this darn television.
We have to use it.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.810
You're wasting a very good
bottle of bubbly

41:52.877 --> 41:56.247
on what will surely
be a mammoth humiliation.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.248
Nonsense.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.016
But you were there, Paul.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.886
What are you expecting?

42:01.986 --> 42:03.387
Get down here!

42:03.487 --> 42:07.424
<i>Hello. I'm Hunter Fox,</i>
<i>president of WGBH,</i>

42:07.525 --> 42:10.561
<i>speaking to you from</i>
<i>our modern, new headquarters.</i>

42:10.661 --> 42:13.697
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>it's a work in progress.</i>

42:13.764 --> 42:16.100
<i>Nevertheless, even during</i>
<i>this transition,</i>

42:16.200 --> 42:20.271
<i>we are premiering an exciting</i>
<i>new program on Monday,</i>

42:20.371 --> 42:22.339
<i>"Economics for Laymen"...</i>

42:22.406 --> 42:24.441
Okay.
Prepare yourself.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.744
<i>...current issues as well</i>
<i>as the basic structure</i>

42:26.844 --> 42:31.181
<i>of our American economy will</i>
<i>be covered in minute detail.</i>

42:31.248 --> 42:36.253
<i>Coming up, something completely</i>
<i>different and entirely fresh.</i>

42:36.353 --> 42:40.124
<i>By fresh, I mean</i>
<i>we're looking at cooking,</i>

42:40.224 --> 42:44.461
<i>French cooking,</i>
<i>on "The French Chef."</i>

42:49.366 --> 42:52.236
I'd hardly call this
a celebration.

42:52.303 --> 42:53.470
They wouldn't air it

42:53.571 --> 42:56.206
if they didn't have
confidence in it.

42:56.273 --> 42:58.275
And you.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.612
Come on.

43:07.718 --> 43:11.989
Paul, there's something
I need to share with you.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.557
I...

43:17.394 --> 43:19.096
Oh, it's just...

43:21.432 --> 43:23.133
It's my body.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.638
The change of life is --

43:27.738 --> 43:31.342
is beginning
to take hold of me.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.077
Ah.

43:35.245 --> 43:37.181
You'll still love me?

43:38.749 --> 43:41.652
You're my partner
in crime.

43:41.752 --> 43:44.922
<i>After all these years,</i>
<i>professionally now to boot.</i>

43:44.989 --> 43:46.523
Hmm?

43:46.624 --> 43:48.492
Of course
I'll still love you.

43:52.963 --> 43:56.867
Well, I guess it was rather
greedy of me to think,

43:56.967 --> 44:00.804
at this point in life,
it was still our turn somehow.

44:02.773 --> 44:05.109
This was my baby.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.014
It was supposed to be
<i>our</i> baby.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.354
Well, shall we turn
the blasted thing on

44:17.454 --> 44:19.223
once and for all?
