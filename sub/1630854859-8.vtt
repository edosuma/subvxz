14:11.450 --> 14:14.120
If you can truly
do these things--

14:14.320 --> 14:16.510
connect to one of our own--

14:16.710 --> 14:17.900
there may be
something we can try.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.170
In the event
of a hostile takeover,

14:20.370 --> 14:22.000
high-ranking Starfleet officers

14:22.200 --> 14:24.560
are given an override codex.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.570
To lock down the ship
and all its systems.

14:27.770 --> 14:31.270
But in this case, we can use it
to unlock it and regain control.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.270
Except that Vadic
has control of every console

14:33.470 --> 14:35.910
on the ship
except on the bridge.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.480
What if I can get up there?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.100
Through them?

14:42.300 --> 14:44.410
I can maybe, just-just possibly

14:44.610 --> 14:46.320
reach out,

14:46.520 --> 14:49.200
connect, or...

14:49.400 --> 14:50.970
even control one of our own.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.930
I can try.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.590
I have to try.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.520
One minute left, Jack.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.480
How exciting.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.530
Input this codex
into the console...

15:47.420 --> 15:49.600
How did you know?

15:50.950 --> 15:54.300
How did you know Jean-Luc
Picard's override codex?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.000
Unless...

15:57.200 --> 15:58.570
Oh, my, my, my.

15:58.770 --> 16:02.650
Is that you in there,
Jack Crusher?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.710
Look at you,

16:06.910 --> 16:10.150
finally living up
to all your potential.

16:10.350 --> 16:11.880
[gasps]

16:16.800 --> 16:18.930
She knows.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.900
- Open comms.
- [boatswain's whistle blows]

16:28.100 --> 16:29.950
Jack, I'm afraid

16:30.150 --> 16:33.160
<i>your first ten minutes</i>
<i>have expired.</i>

16:34.950 --> 16:36.690
[growls]

16:38.040 --> 16:40.000
- Let them go.
You want to do this. Take me.
- SHAW: Hansen...

16:40.200 --> 16:41.790
Hansen!

16:41.990 --> 16:43.570
[whispering]:
Hansen.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.700
There is nothing...

16:45.900 --> 16:47.920
nothing you can do.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.960
He's right.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.580
What's your name?

16:55.780 --> 16:57.980
Ensign Kova Rin Esmar.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.670
Communications,

16:59.870 --> 17:02.450
<i>- USS</i>Titan.
- Jack, don't.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.150
[growls]

17:10.940 --> 17:13.040
And you?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.910
Lieutenant Matthew Arliss Mura.
Tactical.

17:16.110 --> 17:19.420
No! No.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.130
Tell me something else.

17:24.330 --> 17:27.910
Tell me about
someone who loves you.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.880
My... my son.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.400
A son.

17:36.350 --> 17:39.370
<i>Picard has a son.</i>

17:39.570 --> 17:42.670
<i>Why don't you tell him</i>
<i>to come up here.</i>

17:45.100 --> 17:46.800
I can't.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.240
Because I'm Starfleet.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.720
Want to see
what control looks like?

18:07.910 --> 18:09.340
[whimpering]

18:21.010 --> 18:23.100
<i>Tell them.</i>

18:24.190 --> 18:27.100
<i>SEVEN OF NINE:</i>

- Come to the bridge.
- [crying]

18:33.710 --> 18:35.540
If not...

18:36.410 --> 18:39.040
...we'll have to repeat
this little exercise

18:39.230 --> 18:41.160
again and again and again.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.710

18:57.910 --> 18:59.830

19:01.180 --> 19:03.700
We may not survive.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.930
Kestra will have lost everyone.

19:09.970 --> 19:11.980
You're not giving up again,
are you?

19:12.180 --> 19:15.250
You left
the second Jean-Luc called

19:15.440 --> 19:17.940
and put half a galaxy
between us.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.160
I know you were angry
at what I did when Thad died,

19:21.360 --> 19:23.040
but you gave up.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.300
I didn't give up.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.730
I was numb.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.390
You know why?

19:29.590 --> 19:31.910
Because our son died, Deanna,

19:32.110 --> 19:34.090
- and I needed to feel the grief.
- [sighs]

19:34.290 --> 19:36.180
Your grief was taking you over.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.360
You were disappearing from us.

19:38.550 --> 19:42.050
And you used your Betazoid
powers to push yourself

19:42.250 --> 19:44.800
inside my head to dull the pain.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.890
And when that
wasn't enough for you,

19:48.090 --> 19:49.190
we both gave up.

19:49.390 --> 19:51.590
Well, unlike you,

19:51.790 --> 19:53.890
I felt the weight
of everyone's grief

19:54.090 --> 19:56.330
and not just my own.

19:56.530 --> 19:59.420
It was
my last connection to him,

19:59.620 --> 20:01.470
and you tried to erase it.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.380
Not erase it.

20:04.580 --> 20:05.950
Take it.

20:06.150 --> 20:08.910
Help you carry it.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.170
But I forgot the one thing that

20:11.370 --> 20:13.820
all counselors should remember.

20:15.820 --> 20:18.950
You can't skip
to the end of healing.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.100
Besides,

20:31.300 --> 20:33.620
if anyone's
leaving that planet, it's me.

20:34.620 --> 20:35.930
I thought you loved Nepenthe.

20:36.130 --> 20:37.760
No.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.720
We went there for Thad, but
it's not really my cup of tea.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.070
Honey.

20:43.270 --> 20:45.070
- It's not mine either.
- That house--

20:45.270 --> 20:46.770
it's like it was designed
by a cabal

20:46.970 --> 20:49.510
of retro prairie hipsters.

20:49.710 --> 20:52.820
Even the way the-the
front stairs groaned at me.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.260
It's a very judgy foyer.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.960
And those birds every morning,

20:57.150 --> 20:58.610
like screaming babies.

20:58.810 --> 21:02.270
Nepenthian Red-winged Banshees--
horrible.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.700
You know what they say, the only
thing worse than a woodpecker...

21:04.900 --> 21:08.180
BOTH [laughing]:
Is a two-headed woodpecker.

21:08.380 --> 21:11.670
I miss the city, Will.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.490
I miss crowds and

21:13.690 --> 21:16.370
raktajino lattes and people.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.370
I miss people--

21:18.570 --> 21:22.240
angry, joyful,
complicated people.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.280
Then why are we there?

21:25.320 --> 21:28.200
Because we have to be willing

21:28.400 --> 21:31.720
to go through that door
to what's next.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.380
- [door whooshes open]
- Here they come.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.690
- Don't touch her.
- [growling]

21:44.730 --> 21:46.260
[groans]

21:53.390 --> 21:54.790
- Worf!
- Worf!

21:58.090 --> 22:00.850
- One's personal space
is a right.
- TROI: Oh.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.930
Deanna.

22:03.130 --> 22:04.540
I have counted the days

22:04.740 --> 22:07.030
since I last saw you,

22:07.220 --> 22:10.720
like waves in the ocean:
constant and unending.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.470
I have thought
of your empathic gifts

22:13.670 --> 22:15.730
often during my self-evaluation.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.560
- Well, that's wonderful, Worf.
- Inappropriate.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.780
The work I've done on myself...

22:19.980 --> 22:22.350
the level of sensitivity
that I have achieved

22:22.540 --> 22:25.040
has been
in more ways than one...

22:25.240 --> 22:27.250
Is this a rescue mission or
a continuation of the torture?

22:29.390 --> 22:30.610
We must leave.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.690
First, there is something
you must see.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.140
<i>JACK:</i>
<i>What other choice do we have?</i>

22:44.270 --> 22:46.590
<i>We all know this only ends</i>
<i>by me going up to the bridge</i>

22:46.790 --> 22:48.370
<i>and turning myself over.</i>

22:48.570 --> 22:50.370
If I stay here,
eventually she's gonna find me.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.720
But if I go, at least there's
a chance she'll spare the rest.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.900
Jack, please don't do this.
It won't solve anything.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.210
I've tried everything to regain
control of even just one system.

22:59.410 --> 23:00.820
In a year, I could write
a code that could

23:01.020 --> 23:02.430
maybe override her commands.

23:02.630 --> 23:05.040
In month, my father could do it,
but in minutes?

23:05.240 --> 23:07.000
We'd need
an asynchronous AI matrix

23:07.200 --> 23:08.390
capable of computational speeds

23:08.590 --> 23:11.250
beyond 90 trillion
operations a second.

23:18.350 --> 23:19.520
What?

23:20.480 --> 23:23.190
Data, can you hear me in there?

23:23.390 --> 23:25.400
Or am I talking to Lore?

23:30.490 --> 23:32.370
Six years ago,

23:32.570 --> 23:35.810
you brought a gift to
my anniversary dinner on Rigel.

23:36.010 --> 23:38.420
A Chateau Picard Bordeaux,
which you said was too dry

23:38.620 --> 23:41.420
because your taste in wine
is pedestrian at best.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.430
Definitely Picard.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.420
[phasers power off]

23:46.460 --> 23:49.520
Geordi, we have a plan
to regain control of the ship.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.350
We need your robot friend
to talk to the ship,

23:51.550 --> 23:53.830
access its systems and override
Vadic's bridge command.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.400
We can't risk reconnecting him.
It-it...

23:56.600 --> 23:58.010
Data's not exactly
alone in there.

23:58.210 --> 24:00.490
You said there was
some kind of partition

24:00.690 --> 24:03.920
- separating Data's matrix
from Lore's.
- That's a good thing, too.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.490
Otherwise,
there'd be nothing there

24:05.690 --> 24:07.930
to prevent Lore
from completely erasing Data.

24:08.130 --> 24:09.970
Well, couldn't we just
reverse that?

24:10.170 --> 24:11.850
You raise the partition

24:12.050 --> 24:15.330
and Data erases Lore,
then takes control of the ship.

24:15.530 --> 24:17.200
Data's ethical subroutines

24:17.400 --> 24:19.380
don't permit him to take a life

24:19.570 --> 24:20.680
of any kind.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.160
Dad, we're out of options.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.210
[sighs]

24:25.410 --> 24:27.550
All right, uh, th-this
is gonna take time.

24:28.810 --> 24:30.290

Okay, we only have
one chance at this.

24:39.420 --> 24:41.180
When we remove the partition,

24:41.380 --> 24:43.440
there is no going back.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.050
No safeguards, no backups.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.750
Data.

24:46.950 --> 24:49.320
If you can hear me in there,

24:49.520 --> 24:51.220
better buckle up.

overpower me so they can

you would find mightier things.

you were showered with

the galaxy could offer.

What a waste.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.900
Do not worry. It is not him.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.680
It is only his former shell.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.080
His biological body
before he went positronic.

it is not Picard's body
they wanted

43:19.190 --> 43:22.070
is my gratitude
for your friendship.

43:37.220 --> 43:40.830
- Data! [chuckles]
- Counselor.

43:43.270 --> 43:45.890
Admiral, ladies and gentlemen,

43:46.090 --> 43:49.110
allow me to introduce you
to the newest version

43:49.310 --> 43:50.940
of a very old friend.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.290
With an upgrade, I'm told.

43:53.490 --> 43:55.770
Oh, I am mostly myself,
I assure you.

43:55.970 --> 43:59.600
Albeit with a dash
of computational joie de vivre.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.210
PICARD:
The last time we spoke,

44:01.410 --> 44:03.860
you wished to experience death.

44:04.060 --> 44:07.650
As happy as I am
that you're here, I hope that

44:07.850 --> 44:10.130
we haven't betrayed that wish.

44:10.330 --> 44:12.520
No, sir.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.000
I know that me

44:14.200 --> 44:16.750
is resting peacefully.

44:16.940 --> 44:18.780
But this me...

44:20.570 --> 44:23.660
This me would rather be
no place else in the universe.

44:28.490 --> 44:30.450
Join us.

44:32.230 --> 44:33.410
It's been a long time
since we all

44:33.610 --> 44:35.370
sat around a table like this.

44:35.570 --> 44:38.030
Too long, really, by far.

44:38.230 --> 44:39.720
I am so grateful to be here.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.380
Hardship may have
brought me here,

44:41.580 --> 44:43.120
but I want you all to know
that there

44:43.320 --> 44:44.470
wasn't a day all those years

44:44.670 --> 44:47.170
that I didn't miss all of you.

44:47.370 --> 44:49.030
TROI:
And we missed you, too.

44:50.030 --> 44:53.260
I even found myself talking
to you on my darkest days.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.650
Well, on my happiest ones, too.

44:55.850 --> 44:57.830
It turns out you give
really good advice,

44:58.030 --> 44:59.220
even when you're not there.

44:59.420 --> 45:01.570
So you were always in my heart

45:01.770 --> 45:03.480
- when it mattered.
- Thank you.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.490
I have slaughtered countless
enemies over the years

45:07.690 --> 45:10.890
and considered sending
their heads to all of you.

45:11.090 --> 45:14.370
But I was advised that
that was...

45:14.570 --> 45:17.580
- passive-aggressive.
- [scattered laughter]

45:20.020 --> 45:21.510
All that matters is that

45:21.700 --> 45:25.030
we are together once more,

45:25.230 --> 45:28.940
because I need you,
all of you.

45:32.290 --> 45:35.640
Changelings have
infiltrated Starfleet.

45:36.950 --> 45:37.910
Whatever it is
they've got planned,

45:38.110 --> 45:40.000
Frontier Day is just hours away.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.130
RIKER:
And we've got almost no answers.

45:42.330 --> 45:44.700
We're analyzing the data
that we pulled from the <i>Shrike</i>

45:44.900 --> 45:47.880
to see what it was that they
were extracting from your body.

45:48.080 --> 45:51.360
If I may, this is all
factual information

45:51.560 --> 45:53.930
that ignores a...

45:54.130 --> 45:55.710
an emotional truth.

45:55.910 --> 45:58.970
One which I felt the moment
I set foot on this vessel.

46:00.140 --> 46:04.030
Whatever the Changelings
have in store for Frontier Day

46:04.230 --> 46:06.930
is tied directly to Jack.

46:08.670 --> 46:10.200
There's something
happening to him.

46:11.070 --> 46:12.640
Visions, voices.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.470
He has abilities that we...
we just can't explain.

46:15.670 --> 46:17.300
PICARD:
And whatever the cause,

46:17.500 --> 46:19.960
it is getting stronger.

46:20.150 --> 46:23.700
TROI:
There's a darkness
with that boy.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.610
Not in him, but...

46:26.810 --> 46:29.090
around him,
passing through him.

46:30.260 --> 46:34.000
And a voice inside him--
ancient and weak.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.050
But a voice that isn't his own.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.150
I think it's time
I met your son.

47:00.900 --> 47:02.380
Are you ready?

47:03.820 --> 47:06.250
Well, I'll say this.

47:08.430 --> 47:09.870
You don't spend
a lifetime practicing

47:10.070 --> 47:11.480
the art of
charismatic deflection

47:11.680 --> 47:13.490
because you want
to invite people in.

47:13.690 --> 47:15.400
Well, as a counselor,

47:15.600 --> 47:17.800
I would normally
wait for you to seek me out,

47:18.000 --> 47:19.230
but I think we can both agree

47:19.430 --> 47:21.020
that the quickest path
to the truth

47:21.220 --> 47:23.790
is what everyone
needs right now.

47:25.450 --> 47:27.140
So...

47:41.160 --> 47:43.380
[trembling breath]

47:50.210 --> 47:51.260
Jack.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.880
Stay with me.

47:54.070 --> 47:55.870
Follow my voice.

47:56.830 --> 47:59.880
Jack, have you ever--

48:00.080 --> 48:03.670
in your dreams,
in your imagination,

48:03.870 --> 48:06.890
even perhaps when you're awake--

48:07.090 --> 48:09.970
have you ever seen a door?

48:12.710 --> 48:14.190
<i>JACK:</i>
<i>The red door.</i>

48:15.800 --> 48:19.240
<i>- The talking door. </i>
<i>- WHISPERING VOICES: Jack. Jack.</i>

48:21.850 --> 48:24.780
- The door I've no desire
to open.
- Why?

48:24.980 --> 48:26.950
'Cause I'm terrified
about what's behind it.

48:27.150 --> 48:28.680
[growling]

48:30.380 --> 48:32.950
- It's time
to open the door, Jack.
- No.

48:34.820 --> 48:35.950
No.

48:36.910 --> 48:38.570
I don't know that I can.

48:38.770 --> 48:40.260
<i>WHISPERING VOICE:</i>
<i>Jack...</i>

48:41.260 --> 48:43.660
We'll go together.

48:43.860 --> 48:45.010
You're not alone.

48:45.210 --> 48:47.050
<i>[creaking, rumbling]</i>

48:53.620 --> 48:55.410
<i>[whispering voices echoing]</i>

49:07.200 --> 49:09.650
<i>WHISPERING VOICE:</i>
<i>Jack.</i>
