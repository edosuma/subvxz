WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.378
HI.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.446
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME IN?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.154
LISTEN, OLIVER,

00:20.254 --> 00:21.855
THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

00:21.955 --> 00:24.292
TO TALK TO PAUL
BEFORE WE MOVE AWAY.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.527
DON'T YOU AT LEAST WANT
TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIM?

00:29.397 --> 00:31.965
OLIVER, YOUR MOM AND I
ARE GONNA BE

00:32.066 --> 00:33.601
IN MY OFFICE, TALKING.

00:33.701 --> 00:37.205
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT,

00:37.305 --> 00:41.041
JUST COME IN AND JOIN US
ANYTIME YOU WANT, OKAY?

00:43.377 --> 00:44.612
WHATEVER.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.623
( theme music playing )

01:19.180 --> 01:20.781
I KNOW YOU HATE ME.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.217
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT, BESS?

01:23.317 --> 01:25.719
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
YOU TOLD ME NOT TO DO.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.756
SO YOU HAVE--

01:28.856 --> 01:31.459
YOU HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE?

01:31.559 --> 01:34.262
FIRST THING
SATURDAY MORNING,

01:34.362 --> 01:38.366
PACKING UP THE U-HAUL
AND DRIVING UPSTATE.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.969
CAN I ASK YOU HOW OLIVER IS
TAKING ALL THIS?

01:42.069 --> 01:44.138
VERY BADLY.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.407
THANKS FOR ASKING.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.842
HE'S BARELY SPOKEN
TO ME ALL WEEK.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.145
AND WHEN HE DOES,

01:51.245 --> 01:55.383
WELL, HE'S FINDING MORE
AND MORE COLORFUL WAYS

01:55.483 --> 01:57.718
OF TELLING ME
TO FUCK OFF.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.720
IF YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED
NOTHING ELSE HERE,

01:59.820 --> 02:03.524
YOU'VE CERTAINLY HELPED HIM
GET IN TOUCH WITH HIS ANGER.

02:03.624 --> 02:08.196
DO YOU FEEL THAT I HAVE
DISAPPOINTED YOU?

02:08.296 --> 02:11.131
IT'S EMBARRASSING
TO ADMIT THIS NOW,

02:11.232 --> 02:14.235
BUT WHEN HE FIRST
STARTED COMING HERE

02:14.335 --> 02:16.904
I WAS SURE
YOU'D BE ON MY SIDE.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.207
WERE YOU?

02:19.307 --> 02:21.975
WELL, YOU'RE SO SMART
AND REASONABLE,

02:22.075 --> 02:24.812
I THOUGHT
FOR SURE YOU'D BE ABLE
TO GET THROUGH TO OLIVER

02:24.912 --> 02:27.248
AND MAYBE EVEN KNOCK
SOME SENSE INTO LUKE.

02:27.348 --> 02:32.353
WELL, YOU HAD
HIGH HOPES FOR ME.

02:35.856 --> 02:40.394
THEN THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME
TO PICK UP OLIVER'S TURTLE

02:40.494 --> 02:42.563
IT WAS SO CLEAR TO ME

02:42.663 --> 02:44.898
THAT YOU LIVE HERE
ALL ALONE.

02:44.998 --> 02:49.303
AND SOMETHING ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, THE EMPTY PLACE--

02:49.403 --> 02:52.740
IT JUST SEEMED
FAMILIAR TO ME.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.476
AND I THOUGHT--

02:55.576 --> 02:57.345
I THOUGHT WHEN I TOLD YOU
ABOUT MY NEW JOB,

02:57.445 --> 02:59.347
YOU'D BE MORE SYMPATHETIC.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.615
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT
SYMPATHETIC TO YOU,

03:01.715 --> 03:06.053
BUT MY JOB IS TO ADVOCATE
FOR OLIVER.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.623
SO IF I FEEL THAT YOU'RE NOT
ACTING IN HIS BEST INTEREST,

03:09.723 --> 03:11.625
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.595
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW THAT
WHERE OLIVER'S CONCERNED,

03:14.695 --> 03:18.266
I'M MAKING A BAD SITUATION
EVEN WORSE.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.969
BUT I CAN'T WAKE UP
IN THAT HOUSE ANYMORE.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.472
AND ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT OLIVER NEEDS

03:24.572 --> 03:27.007
FAMILIAR THINGS
AROUND HIM NOW.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.009
AND IF HE DOESN'T GET
THOSE THINGS,

03:29.109 --> 03:33.814
THERE MAY VERY WELL BE
CONSEQUENCES.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.650
YOU KNOW THAT ANNOUNCEMENT
THEY MAKE ON PLANES

03:36.750 --> 03:38.452
ABOUT OXYGEN MASKS?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.422
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SHOULD
SECURE YOUR OWN MASK FIRST

03:41.522 --> 03:43.691
BEFORE YOU HELP YOUR CHILD
WITH HIS?

03:43.791 --> 03:46.527
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING NOW.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.363
WELL, IF YOU WANT MY ADVICE,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.465
I'D SAY THAT YOU SHOULD
ADJUST YOUR MASK IMMEDIATELY,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.901
BECAUSE YOUR SON REALLY
NEEDS YOUR HELP.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.840
YOU KNOW,
THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.276
IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF I'VE SPENT OLIVER'S
WHOLE LIFE

04:02.376 --> 04:04.111
FINDING DIFFERENT WAYS
TO BE SELFISH WITH HIM.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.579
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:05.679 --> 04:08.316
WELL, I MEAN I HAD
OLIVER IN THE FIRST PLACE

04:08.416 --> 04:12.052
PARTLY BECAUSE
I WAS GRADUATING.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.454
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.789
AND THEN I SPENT
THE NEXT 12 YEARS

04:15.889 --> 04:18.359
ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO HIM,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.728
WHICH HELPED ME FORGET
THAT I WAS

04:20.828 --> 04:24.197
PATHOLOGICALLY INCAPABLE
OF FINISHING MY DEGREE

04:24.298 --> 04:26.500
AND THAT MY HUSBAND AND I

04:26.600 --> 04:31.204
WEREN'T REALLY
GETTING ALONG ANYMORE.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.808
AND NOW HERE I AM
VIOLENTLY UPROOTING HIM

04:34.908 --> 04:36.877
ALL BECAUSE I NEED
A CHANGE OF SCENE.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.648
I THINK IT'S ONE
OF THE HARDEST THINGS
ABOUT BEING A PARENT--

04:40.748 --> 04:43.951
TRYING TO WEIGH
YOUR OWN NEEDS

04:44.051 --> 04:46.354
AGAINST THOSE
OF YOUR KID.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.757
IT'S A CONSTANT
BALANCING ACT.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.094
OLIVER TOLD ME

04:54.194 --> 04:56.497
LAST WEEK
ON THE PLAYGROUND

04:56.597 --> 04:58.566
HE ASKED IF HE COULD
COME LIVE WITH YOU.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.069
AND WHEN I SAID, "WHY?"
HE SAID

05:02.169 --> 05:05.606
BECAUSE HE'S HAPPIER WITH YOU
THAN HE IS WITH ME OR LUKE.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.375
IS THAT RIGHT?

05:07.475 --> 05:09.677
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.413
IT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.681
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE WHOLE TRUTH.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.116
WHAT HE REALLY NEEDS NOW
IS A HOME

05:16.216 --> 05:18.085
WHERE HE CAN FEEL SAFE.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.488
YOU NEED TO BUILD THAT
FOR HIM.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.090
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.430
HE ALSO SAID
HE WAS VERY ANGRY

05:29.530 --> 05:32.165
THAT YOU WOULDN'T TAKE HIM IN
WHEN HE ASKED YOU TO.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.602
WELL, I THINK HE'S GOT
EVERY RIGHT TO BE.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.941
I THINK YOU'RE
HIS BEST FRIEND.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.878
AND I'M TAKING HIM
AWAY FROM YOU.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.418
I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER
GONNA FORGIVE ME FOR THAT.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.986
I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.822
( knocks on door )

05:56.690 --> 05:58.559
COME IN.

06:00.661 --> 06:04.264
OH, LUKE.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.867
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.602
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.041
I'VE--

06:16.176 --> 06:18.646
I'VE BEEN
AT OUR OLD APARTMENT
ALL AFTERNOON,

06:18.746 --> 06:21.449
PACKING THINGS UP
TO PUT IN STORAGE.

06:21.549 --> 06:25.586
AND SUDDENLY
I JUST FELT

06:25.686 --> 06:28.088
THE NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY.

06:28.188 --> 06:32.526
AND THEN I REMEMBERED
IT WAS WEDNESDAY AT 4:00,

06:32.626 --> 06:35.295
SO I FIGURED I'D ALREADY
PAID FOR THE HOUR, SO...

06:35.395 --> 06:38.832
WHEN YOU WERE KNOCKING
WE THOUGHT IT WAS OLIVER

06:38.932 --> 06:41.401
AND THAT HE WAS FINALLY
READY TO TALK.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.403
NO SUCH LUCK.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.439
HE'S SITTING THERE
LIKE HE'S GETTING READY

06:45.539 --> 06:47.407
TO STRANGLE SOMEBODY.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.042
WELL, AT LEAST HE HASN'T
RUN AWAY AGAIN.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.978
SMALL BLESSINGS, RIGHT?

06:52.680 --> 06:56.049
YOU KNOW, I'M TAKING
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS OFF

06:56.149 --> 06:58.519
TO BE WITH HIM BEFORE
HE AND BESS MOVE AWAY.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.755
BUT SINCE HE'S NOT
SPEAKING TO ME,

07:01.855 --> 07:06.560
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
ACTIVITIES WE'RE GONNA DO.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.796
I GUESS WE COULD PLAY
A LOT OF CHARADES, YOU KNOW?

07:10.598 --> 07:14.434
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.838
WHAT IS IT?

07:19.573 --> 07:22.576
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST THIS MEMORY
I WAS HAVING

07:22.676 --> 07:25.513
OF THE THREE OF US
MOVING INTO THAT PLACE

07:25.613 --> 07:27.781
WHEN OLIVER WAS A BABY.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.752
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE THOUGHT

07:31.852 --> 07:34.755
WE COULD AFFORD A WHOLE
BROWNSTONE FLOOR.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.659
WE WERE LIVING
SO FAR BEYOND OUR MEANS.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.195
AND THE PLACE WAS
A COMPLETE WRECK.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.732
THE PLASTER
WAS CRUMBLING.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.734
THE WALLS WERE
JUST BUCKLING.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.970
THERE WERE EXPOSED WIRES
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.207
YEAH, WE WERE SO DELUDED,
WE THOUGHT

07:54.307 --> 07:55.809
WE COULD ACTUALLY
FIX IT UP OURSELVES.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.779
THERE WAS THIS PIPE
IN THE BATHROOM

07:58.879 --> 08:02.883
THAT KEPT SPURTING
LITTLE DROPS OF HOT WATER
INTO THE AIR.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.386
I NEVER COULD FIX IT,
SO WE HAD TO KEEP THE WINDOW
OPEN ALL THE TIME

08:06.486 --> 08:08.155
'CAUSE IT WAS
LIKE A SAUNA IN THERE.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.590
EXCEPT IT WAS
THE DEAD OF WINTER.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.759
AND SO ONE MORNING
I WAS BRUSHING MY TEETH

08:11.859 --> 08:16.196
AND THE WARM AIR
FROM THE WATER PIPE

08:16.296 --> 08:18.398
MET THE COLD AIR
FROM THE WINDOW

08:18.498 --> 08:20.233
AND IT STARTED RAINING
ON ME INSIDE.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.169
( laughs )

08:40.988 --> 08:42.623
THE TWO OF YOU

08:42.723 --> 08:45.626
HAVE AN EASE
WITH EACH OTHER

08:45.726 --> 08:48.095
THAT I'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.297
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

08:55.002 --> 08:56.904
'CAUSE IT'S OVER.

09:02.175 --> 09:06.146
YOU KNEW IT
A LONG TIME BEFORE I DID.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.617
AND THEN EVEN WHEN
IT WAS REALLY CLEAR TO ME,

09:09.717 --> 09:12.586
I WAS JUST TOO STUBBORN
TO LET GO.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.722
I WAS PRETTY STUBBORN
MYSELF.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.424
I WAS TRYING

09:17.524 --> 09:19.927
TO GET YOU TO BE
SOMEBODY YOU WEREN'T

09:21.461 --> 09:23.330
IN A MARRIAGE
I DIDN'T WANT.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.768
YEAH.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.310
WE WERE JUST CHILDREN

09:39.079 --> 09:40.748
PLAYING HOUSE.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.651
IF WE DIDN'T
HAVE OLIVER...

09:43.751 --> 09:46.586
ALL THIS TIME AND EFFORT,
AND THAT'S ALL WE ARE--

09:48.856 --> 09:53.126
JUST TWO PEOPLE
WHO SHOULD HAVE NEVER
GOTTEN MARRIED.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.463
LOOK, I'M SURE
THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING

09:56.563 --> 09:58.799
OF WHAT YOU ARE
TO EACH OTHER

09:58.899 --> 10:01.568
WILL CONTINUE
TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE.

10:01.669 --> 10:05.005
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE
REACHED THIS POINT,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.641
PERHAPS WE CAN STOP
BLAMING EACH OTHER

10:07.741 --> 10:10.443
FOR ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU'VE FAILED YOUR SON.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.612
AND MAYBE YOU CAN FINALLY
WORK TOGETHER

10:12.713 --> 10:14.347
TO BE HIS PARENTS.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.150
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU FEEL

10:17.250 --> 10:19.687
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
WRONG FOR EACH OTHER,

10:19.787 --> 10:22.322
HE IS THE ONE THING--

10:22.422 --> 10:24.324
THE ONE
EXTRAORDINARY THING

10:24.424 --> 10:26.626
THAT YOU HAVE
BUILT TOGETHER.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.009
I'D BETTER GET BACK
TO THE APARTMENT

10:42.109 --> 10:43.844
'CAUSE I HAVE A LOT
OF PACKING TO DO.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.379
YOU WANT ME
TO COME OVER LATER,
HELP YOU PACK UP?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.615
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT

10:48.716 --> 10:51.985
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO TAKE OLIVER TONIGHT.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.788
WELL, I THOUGHT I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO GET HIM
UNTIL TOMORROW.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.790
YEAH, IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME
THAT MAYBE YOU'D LIKE

10:56.890 --> 10:59.159
TO SPEND SOME MORE TIME
WITH HIM BEFORE WE LEAVE.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
OKAY.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.770
OKAY, I'M GOING TO SEE
IF I CAN GET OLIVER

11:09.870 --> 11:11.839
TO COME IN AND TALK.

11:14.908 --> 11:18.078
BESS, I JUST WANT TO SAY

11:18.178 --> 11:22.082
THAT I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN
HARSH AT TIMES,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.918
BUT I REALLY ADMIRE
YOUR COURAGE.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.190
THANK YOU.

11:36.663 --> 11:41.234
( door opens and closes )

11:57.184 --> 11:58.318
SO...

12:00.287 --> 12:02.155
NOW I GET THE NEXT
TWO AND A HALF DAYS

12:02.255 --> 12:04.391
TO MAKE UP
FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.060
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT

12:07.160 --> 12:09.662
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
ONCE OLIVER MOVES AWAY?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.765
BESS WILL BE TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF OLIVER

12:11.865 --> 12:14.034
WHILE SHE'S STARTING
A NEW JOB.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.869
I'LL BE DRIVING
UP THERE AND BACK

12:15.969 --> 12:17.938
TWICE EVERY WEEKEND.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.408
OLIVER WILL PROBABLY BE MORE
MISERABLE THAN HE IS NOW.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.844
IT'LL BE A DISASTER.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.813
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE

12:25.913 --> 12:27.714
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
THAT YOU CAN DO?

12:27.815 --> 12:29.716
I'VE GONE OVER IT
A MILLION TIMES IN MY HEAD,

12:29.817 --> 12:31.451
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.891
WHAT, YOU THINK I'M EXCITED
ABOUT BEING A DIVORCED DAD,

12:37.991 --> 12:41.962
ONLY SEEING MY KID
ON THE WEEKEND?

12:42.062 --> 12:43.964
IT'S NOT THE WAY
I WANTED IT.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.234
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE FAILED OLIVER?

12:47.334 --> 12:50.070
OF COURSE I DO.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.473
I KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE
TO HAVE MY FATHER ERASE ME.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.544
IT'S THE MAIN REASON
WHY I STAYED MARRIED

12:57.644 --> 12:59.246
ALL THESE YEARS,

13:00.747 --> 13:02.916
TRYING TO AVOID WHAT'S
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.886
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO UNDO ALL THIS, YOU KNOW.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.454
YES, IT IS.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.157
I'VE ALREADY LOST HIM.

13:10.257 --> 13:14.027
THAT'S BECOME CLEAR OVER
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.629
OH, YEAH, HE'LL LET ME
BUY HIM SOME SNEAKERS

13:16.729 --> 13:18.165
OR TAKE HIM TO SEE
THE KNICKS,

13:18.265 --> 13:20.267
BUT HE WON'T COME TO ME
WHEN HE HAS PROBLEMS.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.837
LOOK, HE MAY BE
PULLING AWAY FROM YOU NOW
BECAUSE HE'S ANGRY,

13:23.937 --> 13:27.474
BUT HE STILL NEEDS YOU
VERY MUCH.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.543
I NEVER REALLY LEARNED
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.080
I ALWAYS PASSED HIM OFF
TO BESS.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.486
TRUTH IS,

13:39.586 --> 13:43.356
I PROBABLY NEVER
WANTED TO BE A FATHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.058
DO YOU LOVE YOUR SON?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.860
YES.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.729
OF COURSE.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.266
BUT LOOK WHAT I DID
LAST WEEK.

13:53.366 --> 13:57.404
I MEAN, BESS SAYS
SHE'S MOVING AWAY,

13:57.504 --> 14:01.274
AND I DIDN'T LIFT A FINGER
TO FIGHT FOR OLIVER.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.610
I PRACTICALLY FORCED HER
TO TAKE HIM...

14:06.413 --> 14:08.381
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE HIM.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.984
I UNDERSTAND
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

14:11.084 --> 14:12.652
THAT YOU WISH
YOU'D DONE DIFFERENTLY,

14:12.752 --> 14:14.654
BUT THAT'S IN THE PAST.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.489
THE ONLY THING
THAT REALLY MATTERS NOW

14:16.589 --> 14:19.492
IS THE KIND OF FATHER
YOU'RE GOING TO BE TO OLIVER

14:19.592 --> 14:21.128
FROM HERE ON OUT.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.196
RIGHT, SO WHAT DO WE
HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

14:23.296 --> 14:26.599
I'LL SEE HIM
LESS AND LESS.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.868
RIGHT?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.638
I'LL BECOME THE MAN
WHO WRITES THE CHECKS.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.440
LOOK, IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THAT BLEAK.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.343
YOU HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL
OVER HOW BIG A PART

14:36.443 --> 14:38.045
YOU PLAY IN HIS LIFE.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.647
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS,
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OLIVER--

14:40.747 --> 14:43.283
IT'S NEVER GOING
TO BE OVER.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.519
HE'LL ALWAYS WANT YOU
TO BE HIS FATHER.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.189
SO YOU CAN'T EVER
GIVE UP ON HIM

14:49.289 --> 14:51.091
OR YOURSELF.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.794
ALL RIGHT.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.563
I UNDERSTAND.

14:58.165 --> 15:01.401
SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY TIPS TO GIVE ME,

15:01.501 --> 15:05.138
ANY WORDS OF WISDOM
BEFORE YOU PUNCH OUT?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.440
NOTHING THAT YOU REALLY
WANT TO HEAR.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.642
THE TRUTH IS, LUKE,
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

15:09.742 --> 15:13.013
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET WORSE
FOR OLIVER AND FOR YOU.

15:13.113 --> 15:17.350
FOR A LONG TIME HE IS
GOING TO BE VERY ANGRY AT YOU.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.419
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP LOVING HIM

15:19.519 --> 15:21.854
NO MATTER WHAT.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.791
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET HIM
HAVE HIS ANGER.

15:24.891 --> 15:28.928
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE IT,
JUST LET HIM BE WHO HE IS.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.065
- SO JUST TAKE IT?
- AND KEEP SHOWING UP.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.768
ALL RIGHT, I THINK
I CAN DO THAT.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.304
AND TAKE IT
STEP BY STEP.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.772
RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT
TWO AND A HALF DAYS WITH HIM

15:39.872 --> 15:43.210
ALL TO YOURSELF.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.917
ALL RIGHT.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.419
UH...

15:54.821 --> 15:56.223
YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE GO,

15:56.323 --> 15:57.790
I THINK YOU AND OLIVER
SHOULD TALK.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.427
YEAH, LET'S JOIN HIM.

16:08.868 --> 16:12.372
HEY, OLIVER, IT'S ALMOST
TIME TO HEAD OUT.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.142
DO YOU WANT
TO GO INTO THE OFFICE
AND SAY GOODBYE TO PAUL?

16:27.420 --> 16:30.290
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MIGHT BE
MAD WITH EVERYTHING,

16:31.558 --> 16:34.261
BUT YOU KNOW
NONE OF IT IS PAUL'S FAULT.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.697
AND I KNOW
YOU LIKE HIM A LOT.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.699
AND HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT YOU TOO.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.406
MAYBE YOU'RE FEELING
TOO ANGRY TO TALK RIGHT NOW,

16:47.574 --> 16:49.142
BUT SOMEDAY

16:49.242 --> 16:52.445
I BET YOU WON'T BE
SO ANGRY ANYMORE

16:52.545 --> 16:55.315
AND YOU'LL MISS HIM.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.717
AND YOU'LL BE GLAD
YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

16:57.817 --> 16:59.319
TO SEE HIM TODAY.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.356
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:13.833 --> 17:15.135
OKAY.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.805
ALL RIGHT.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.211
THANK YOU, LUKE.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.696
HOW ARE YOU?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.099
YOU DIDN'T HELP ME AT ALL.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.503
LOOK,

17:52.805 --> 17:54.807
I'M SORRY
I LET YOU DOWN.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.709
EVERYTHING GOT WORSE.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.312
I WISH I COULD SOLVE
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, OLIVER,

17:59.412 --> 18:02.615
BUT I JUST-- I CAN'T.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.785
BUT ONE THING I CAN DO

18:05.885 --> 18:08.255
IS TALK WITH YOU

18:08.355 --> 18:10.990
ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.126
SO WHAT?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.094
WELL, FOR ONE THING,

18:15.195 --> 18:17.430
MAYBE IT WILL HELP YOU
FEEL LESS ALONE.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.631
I AM ALONE.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.000
AND I'M NOT GONNA
GET TO SEE YOU ANYMORE.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.402
I KNOW.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.805
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M REALLY GLAD

18:25.905 --> 18:27.774
THAT WE HAD THIS CHANCE

18:27.874 --> 18:29.842
JUST TO TALK.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.048
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR WEEK?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.084
LET'S BEGIN THERE.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.820
TODAY WAS
MY LAST DAY AT SCHOOL.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.224
OH, AND HOW DID THAT GO?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.759
THEY HAD A GOING-AWAY
PARTY FOR ME.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.695
MY TEACHER MADE BROWNIES.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.798
AND ERIC WASN'T THERE,
SO THAT WAS GOOD.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.200
WHY WASN'T ERIC THERE?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.302
HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.504
WHAT'S ERIC DOING
IN THE HOSPITAL?

18:57.604 --> 19:00.573
HE WAS LIGHTING
SOME M-80s

19:00.673 --> 19:03.810
AND THEY EXPLODED
AND BLEW HIS PINKIE OFF.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.078
OH.

19:06.179 --> 19:09.216
THAT'S PRETTY AWFUL FOR ERIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:09.316 --> 19:12.352
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE PICKED ON YOU SO MUCH?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.287
DO YOU THINK
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

19:14.387 --> 19:16.856
BECAUSE HE HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS
OF HIS OWN, YOU KNOW?

19:19.592 --> 19:20.827
MAYBE.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.729
SO HOW IS MAYA DOING?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.266
SHE GOT ME
A GOING-AWAY GIFT.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.935
COOL.
WHAT DID SHE GET?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.273
( chuckles )
THAT'S SWEET.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.245
YOU'RE GONNA MISS HER,
RIGHT?

19:45.385 --> 19:48.488
I'LL MISS MY HOUSE.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.824
YOUR DAD TOLD ME
THAT HE CAME OVER TODAY
TO HELP YOU PACK.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.893
HOW WAS THAT?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.662
WEIRD.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.897
LIKE HE WAS LIVING
WITH US AGAIN,

19:57.997 --> 20:00.467
EXCEPT HE WASN'T.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.770
HE AND MY MOM BOTH
STARTED TO CRY A LITTLE.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.172
BOTH OF THEM?

20:06.273 --> 20:09.609
SO WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.544
I HATED IT.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.246
YOU KNOW, ONCE WHEN I WAS
ABOUT YOUR AGE

20:13.346 --> 20:16.716
I SAW MY DAD CRY.

20:16.816 --> 20:20.287
HE WAS HAVING A BIG FIGHT
WITH MY MOM.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.422
THEY WERE YELLING
AT EACH OTHER.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.024
I JUST WANTED THEM
TO STOP.

20:25.124 --> 20:29.296
I GUESS I WANTED THEM
TO BE JUST HAPPY.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.965
AND IT MADE ME SO PISSED

20:33.065 --> 20:34.967
WHEN I FOUND OUT

20:35.067 --> 20:37.904
THAT THEY WEREN'T.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.408
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:41.508 --> 20:44.311
WELL, I STAYED PISSED AT THEM

20:44.411 --> 20:46.979
FOR A LONG TIME.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.282
AND THEN I REALIZED

20:49.382 --> 20:51.418
THAT EVEN THOUGH

20:51.518 --> 20:54.020
MY MOM AND DAD GOT UPSET

20:54.120 --> 20:57.223
AND THEY MADE BIG MISTAKES
SOMETIMES,

20:57.324 --> 21:01.394
THEY STILL LOVED ME.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.997
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:05.097 --> 21:09.101
OKAY, IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING
SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED,

21:09.201 --> 21:11.338
TELL THEM.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.640
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SOMETHING IS HAPPENING,

21:13.740 --> 21:15.942
SAY, "CAN YOU PLEASE
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME?"

21:16.042 --> 21:19.178
AND IF THINGS GET REALLY
UPSETTING AND CONFUSING,

21:19.278 --> 21:21.581
CALL ME.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.316
THAT WAY WE CAN
WORK TOGETHER

21:23.416 --> 21:25.552
TO TRY AND SOLVE
THE PROBLEM.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.456
( sighs )

21:33.426 --> 21:35.595
DOES YOUR SON LIVE
FAR AWAY?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.897
MM-HMM.

21:37.997 --> 21:42.535
I GO VISIT HIM
ON WEEKENDS.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.237
THIS SATURDAY I'M TAKING HIM
TO THE AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM

21:45.338 --> 21:47.206
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.275
HE LIKES TO LOOK
AT THE ROCKETS

21:49.376 --> 21:51.878
AND THE SATELLITES
ESPECIALLY.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.815
DO YOU MISS HIM?

21:55.915 --> 21:59.786
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.054
BUT, SEE, I'M WITH HIM

22:02.154 --> 22:06.593
WHENEVER I CAN BE.

22:06.693 --> 22:11.197
AND I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT HIM.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.600
I MEAN, WE TALK
ON THE PHONE EVERY DAY.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.769
SO I GET TO HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY

22:16.869 --> 22:19.872
AND I GET TO TELL HIM
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.044
THAT REMINDS ME--

22:25.144 --> 22:27.380
I'VE GOT TO MAKE A CALL.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.584
CAN YOU GIVE ME A SEC?

22:42.562 --> 22:45.432
( phone ringing )

22:51.037 --> 22:51.871
HELLO.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.906
HEY, OLIVER.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.544
IT'S PAUL IN BROOKLYN.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.311
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D CHECK IN

22:59.412 --> 23:02.348
AND SEE HOW THINGS
WERE GOING UPSTATE.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.017
- THIS IS DUMB.
- ( chuckles )

23:06.152 --> 23:07.954
SO HOW ARE YOU?

23:09.088 --> 23:10.790
WHEN DID YOU MOVE IN?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.461
LAST WEEK.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.963
AND HOW HAS IT BEEN
GOING SO FAR?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.399
OKAY, I GUESS.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.234
WHERE'S YOUR HOUSE?

23:22.334 --> 23:24.336
IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.872
DO YOU LIKE YOUR ROOM?

23:25.972 --> 23:27.239
NOT REALLY.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.442
IN BROOKLYN, MY ROOM
IS PAINTED BLUE.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.944
WHAT IF YOU AND YOUR MOM
GO TO THE HARDWARE STORE

23:32.044 --> 23:34.180
AND BUY SOME BLUE PAINT?

23:34.280 --> 23:37.416
THAT WAY YOUR ROOM
CAN LOOK

23:37.517 --> 23:39.418
THE SAME AS IT DID
IN BROOKLYN.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.787
I GUESS.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.255
HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR MOM
GETTING ON THESE DAYS?

23:43.355 --> 23:45.958
SHE'S REALLY BUSY.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.727
SHE'S TEACHING A LOT,

23:47.827 --> 23:49.629
SO I DON'T GET
TO SEE HER VERY MUCH.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.364
BUT YOU HAVE DINNER TOGETHER
EVERY NIGHT, YEAH?

23:52.465 --> 23:53.866
YEAH.

23:53.966 --> 23:57.637
AND THEN YOU TELL HER
ALL ABOUT YOUR DAY.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.172
YEAH.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.975
HAS YOUR DAD COME UP
TO VISIT YOU?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.944
NOT YET,

24:05.044 --> 24:07.146
BUT THIS WEEKEND
HE'S COMING TO GET ME

24:07.246 --> 24:08.280
AND WE'RE GOING
TO THE CITY.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.782
COOL.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.651
BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO THERE.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.253
WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM,

24:14.353 --> 24:16.556
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
MAKE A LIST

24:16.656 --> 24:18.558
OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU WANT TO DO--

24:18.658 --> 24:21.661
MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW,
GO TO A BASKETBALL GAME,

24:21.761 --> 24:23.663
MAYBE EVEN GO BACK
TO THAT RESTAURANT

24:23.763 --> 24:25.431
WHERE YOU HAD
THE PAELLA.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.867
THAT'D BE FUN.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.637
SO HOW ARE THINGS
GOING AT SCHOOL?

24:30.737 --> 24:33.840
ALL THE KIDS ARE STRANGE.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.643
I BET THERE'S
ONE OR TWO KIDS

24:36.743 --> 24:39.078
THAT YOU KIND OF LIKE.

24:42.448 --> 24:45.384
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE,
OLIVER.

24:45.484 --> 24:49.321
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
NEW AND STRANGE FOR A BIT.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.858
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA DO OKAY.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.360
I THINK THINGS ARE
GONNA WORK OUT

24:54.460 --> 24:57.096
AND YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO BE FINE.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.501
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.671
OH, IT'S DINNER TIME?

25:04.771 --> 25:07.006
YEAH, I'LL CALL YOU
NEXT WEEK.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.643
GOODBYE, OLIVER.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.266
I SHOULD GO NOW.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.137
WELL, WE STILL HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.809
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE

25:42.909 --> 25:44.944
THAT YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

25:59.726 --> 26:02.762
( music playing )
