- RONA: Come now, Mary.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:12:51.306 --> 01:12:52.841
RONA: We know, I'm not perfect.

01:12:52.841 --> 01:12:54.542
- You are not perfect.
- Exactly.

01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:56.178
- RONA: You know, there's this...
- Yeah.

01:12:56.178 --> 01:12:58.814
...other side
and you've coped a lot,

01:12:58.814 --> 01:13:01.650
and I'd like to know
how you get through it.

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:04.286
What do you use in order to get

01:13:04.286 --> 01:13:06.558
through those
very, very rough times?

01:13:07.225 --> 01:13:08.727
You lost a sister.

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:12.222
MARY: <i>She was 21.</i>

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:15.030
<i>She had been living
with a young man</i>

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:16.298
<i>whom she loved,</i>

01:13:16.298 --> 01:13:20.802
<i>and he broke it off with her
and she couldn't handle that.</i>

01:13:20.802 --> 01:13:25.341
<i>And so she drank
and she took barbiturates,</i>

01:13:25.341 --> 01:13:27.009
<i>and nobody is sure</i>

01:13:27.009 --> 01:13:30.445
<i>whether or not
that was a purposeful act</i>

01:13:30.445 --> 01:13:35.316
<i>but she died that night
of an overdose.</i>

01:13:35.316 --> 01:13:37.585
RONA: <i>What do you call upon</i>

01:13:37.585 --> 01:13:40.856
<i>to get you through
those kind of times?</i>

01:13:40.856 --> 01:13:43.595
I don't know how to describe it,
except--

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:48.430
You know, to use the word, survivor.

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:53.002
One who survives.
I believe in tomorrow.

01:13:53.002 --> 01:13:56.438
I believe
that things that are painful...

01:13:56.438 --> 01:14:01.080
uh, will not be as painful
in some time.

- Trust.
- RONA: You're kind?

01:14:40.615 --> 01:14:46.421
And respect for intelligence.
Um, a compatibility.

01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:48.994
It's almost like a marriage
without sex.

01:14:49.661 --> 01:14:51.426
Um, isn't it?

01:14:51.426 --> 01:14:53.565
- Really. Yeah.
- RONA: Of sorts?

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:55.964
Enjoying the same things,

being able to fight

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.969
RONA: Do you think
that's what ruins marriage?

01:15:00.969 --> 01:15:03.608
- Sex? (LAUGHS)
- RONA: Is that the sex-- Yeah.

01:15:04.842 --> 01:15:06.075
REPORTER:
<i>Actress Mary Tyler Moore</i>

01:15:06.075 --> 01:15:09.344
<i>has filed for divorce
from her husband, Grant Tinker.</i>

01:15:09.344 --> 01:15:10.745
The two were married
for 18 years

01:15:10.745 --> 01:15:14.082
and together they created
and ran MTM Enterprises,

01:15:14.082 --> 01:15:14.984
<i>the television company</i>

01:15:14.984 --> 01:15:17.518
<i>that gave us</i>
The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

01:15:17.518 --> 01:15:20.488
RONA: What really started
the process

01:15:20.488 --> 01:15:24.092
of Mary Tyler Moore
saying to herself,

01:15:24.092 --> 01:15:28.597
"The time has come for me
to become an independent person,

01:15:28.597 --> 01:15:31.801
no longer attached
to a husband."

01:15:31.801 --> 01:15:33.468
<i>You moved back
to New York City.</i>

01:15:33.468 --> 01:15:34.703
- MARY: <i>Yes.</i>
- RONA: <i>And you said to me,</i>

01:15:34.703 --> 01:15:36.338
<i>New York City
was gonna provide me</i>

01:15:36.338 --> 01:15:37.705
<i>with a new kind of life.</i>

01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:41.409
<i>You divorced after some 17,
18 years of marriage.</i>

01:15:41.409 --> 01:15:42.978
<i>Is it difficult
to be on your own?</i>

01:15:42.978 --> 01:15:44.846
MARY: <i>Oh, yeah.
It's very difficult.</i>

01:15:44.846 --> 01:15:47.049
Marriage relationships
or lover relationships

01:15:47.049 --> 01:15:49.217
are destined to last
a certain amount of time.

01:15:49.217 --> 01:15:51.853
<i>Never think of that
as a failed marriage.</i>

01:15:51.853 --> 01:15:54.923
<i>And it has nothing to do
with why a marriage ends.</i>

01:15:54.923 --> 01:15:56.858
<i>Who wants it to end,
who doesn't.</i>

01:15:56.858 --> 01:15:59.228
<i>It's just completely alien
to you</i>

01:15:59.228 --> 01:16:01.196
<i>after that amount of time.</i>

01:16:01.196 --> 01:16:02.664
It's a big transition to make.

01:16:02.664 --> 01:16:06.902
<i>In my case, it coincided
with a change in career</i>

01:16:06.902 --> 01:16:09.438
and it may have looked
as though I calculated,

01:16:09.438 --> 01:16:11.173
"Oh, now, I'm going
to end my marriage.

01:16:11.173 --> 01:16:13.575
I'm going to do drama.
I'm going to move to New York."

01:16:13.575 --> 01:16:15.981
And it truly didn't happen
that way.

01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:19.375
TREVA:
<i>I knew she was in New York</i>

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.416
<i>because she was starring
in a play</i>

01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:22.950
<i>called</i> Whose Life Is Anyway?

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:26.389
<i>which was diametrically
different from Mary Richards.</i>

01:16:26.389 --> 01:16:27.522
<i>It was a drama</i>

01:16:27.522 --> 01:16:30.992
<i>with a lot of sarcastic,
sardonic humor</i>

01:16:30.992 --> 01:16:33.861
<i>of a woman fighting
for the right to die.</i>

01:16:33.861 --> 01:16:37.098
MANNY: <i>The phone rang
and it was Mary Tyler Moore</i>

01:16:37.098 --> 01:16:39.301
<i>who said,
"I want to do that play."</i>

01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:41.269
<i>The extraordinary part was,</i>

01:16:41.269 --> 01:16:46.274
<i>Mary Tyler Moore was a major,
major star in this country</i>

01:16:46.274 --> 01:16:49.111
<i>and she decided
to walk away from that.</i>

01:16:49.111 --> 01:16:51.513
<i>And she came
to the first rehearsal</i>

01:16:51.513 --> 01:16:53.018
<i>fully memorized.</i>

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:57.752
MARY: <i>Well, I didn't really
leave television.</i>

01:16:57.752 --> 01:17:00.890
What happened then was
that I was offered the play,

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:02.091
<i>Whose Life is it Anyway?</i>

01:17:02.091 --> 01:17:05.226
And it was
so beautifully written and...

01:17:05.226 --> 01:17:08.397
had already been a success
with Tom Conti starring in it

01:17:08.397 --> 01:17:10.065
that I wanted to try that.

01:17:10.065 --> 01:17:13.335
MANNY: <i>Mary Tyler Moore
replaced Tom Conti</i>

01:17:13.335 --> 01:17:14.769
<i>who had won the Tony.</i>

01:17:14.769 --> 01:17:17.172
<i>And it's a rare item
that somebody goes in</i>

01:17:17.172 --> 01:17:20.109
<i>after a star
and replicates the role.</i>

01:17:20.109 --> 01:17:21.343
<i>I'm not quite sure</i>

01:17:21.343 --> 01:17:25.547
<i>what the impetus for her
doing that play was.</i>

01:17:25.547 --> 01:17:29.551
<i>Everyone will take credit for it
because it was a unique moment</i>

01:17:29.551 --> 01:17:31.447
<i>that hadn't been done before.</i>

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:34.522
<i>I suspect
it was always her idea.</i>

01:17:34.522 --> 01:17:36.119
<i>The truth is,
I didn't think of it,</i>

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:37.392
<i>nor did the director.</i>

01:17:37.392 --> 01:17:39.427
MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG:
<i>We talked about it and she said,</i>

01:17:39.427 --> 01:17:42.064
<i>did I think it would work
with a woman playing the part?</i>

01:17:42.064 --> 01:17:43.931
<i>And I thought,
"Why wouldn't it?"</i>

01:17:43.931 --> 01:17:48.136
<i>And so, Mary came to New York
and we started rehearsing.</i>

01:17:48.136 --> 01:17:49.938
MANNY:
<i>She was ahead of the game.</i>

01:17:49.938 --> 01:17:53.874
<i>Not only did she replace the man
who won the Tony,</i>

01:17:53.874 --> 01:17:57.045
<i>but this was one of the most
glamorous women in America.</i>

01:17:57.045 --> 01:18:00.949
<i>And she decided to play a woman
that was paralyzed</i>

01:18:00.949 --> 01:18:02.784
<i>and had a sheet covering her</i>

01:18:02.784 --> 01:18:05.190
<i>in a hospital bed
for the entire evening.</i>

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.523
You were so successful
for so many years,

01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.091
it's just like
people are waiting

01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:13.329
for someone as successful
as you are to have a failure.

01:18:13.329 --> 01:18:14.629
And they were--

01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:16.526
It seems true
that they were hoping

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:17.999
maybe you'd just retire
from show business

01:18:17.999 --> 01:18:19.869
but you didn't.
You went to the Broadway play,

01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:21.504
which was not an easy thing
to do.

01:18:21.504 --> 01:18:22.570
Oh, I... I don't have

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:24.205
such a jaded view of people.
(CHUCKLES)

01:18:24.205 --> 01:18:26.875
It's that, I think there are
maybe about 17 people

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:28.110
who hope you fall
on your face...

01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:29.778
- LETTERMAN: Yeah.
- ...but we tend to magnify that.

01:18:29.778 --> 01:18:30.980
I don't think it's true.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.185
I'm awfully glad
I did that play.

01:18:34.985 --> 01:18:39.020
TREVA: <i>She was extraordinary.
She got incredible reviews.</i>

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.989
MARY: <i>It was
a terrific achievement for me.</i>

01:18:40.989 --> 01:18:44.460
<i>It exonerated me
from</i> Breakfast at Tiffany's,

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:45.693
<i>and again it showed</i>

01:18:45.693 --> 01:18:48.229
<i>a rather skeptical
New York contingent</i>

01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:51.833
<i>that there might be something
to television after all.</i>

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:55.203
TREVA: <i>I went backstage
to see her and I told her</i>

01:18:55.203 --> 01:18:59.641
<i>there was not one gesture,
not one single thing</i>

01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:02.344
<i>that was a Mary Richards
kind of thing.</i>

01:19:02.344 --> 01:19:04.112
<i>And she said...</i>
(GASPING) <i>"...I'm so glad</i>

01:19:04.112 --> 01:19:07.282
<i>because you're the first person
from the show who's been here."</i>

01:19:07.282 --> 01:19:10.051
<i>And she said,
"I was very, very intent</i>

01:19:10.051 --> 01:19:13.158
<i>on not doing any Mary Richards."</i>

01:19:14.258 --> 01:19:16.426
<i>Funnily enough,</i>
The Mary Tyler Moore Show

01:19:16.426 --> 01:19:18.660
now mirrors my life.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.763
Uh, when I was filming
that show,

01:19:20.763 --> 01:19:22.330
I was married,
I was born married.

01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:24.900
I'd never had
the single experience, you know?

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:28.170
And for the last three years,
I've been on my own,

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:30.873
<i>and now living almost every one
of the episodes</i>

01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:32.074
<i>that we filmed.</i> (LAUGHING)

01:19:32.074 --> 01:19:33.908
<i>All those situations,
I can now say,</i>

01:19:33.908 --> 01:19:38.413
<i>"Oh, now, I really understand
what was happening."</i>

01:19:38.413 --> 01:19:40.282
<i>I decided to stay in New York</i>

01:19:40.282 --> 01:19:44.853
<i>and try to capture my life
for myself.</i>

01:19:44.853 --> 01:19:47.389
TREVA: <i>Here she was, 40,
seeing what life</i>

01:19:47.389 --> 01:19:51.326
<i>for an adorable single person
was like.</i>

01:19:51.326 --> 01:19:54.529
<i>And she loved what it was like.</i>
(CHUCKLING)

01:19:54.529 --> 01:19:58.634
<i>The only way I could say it is
that she was more like Rhoda.</i>

01:19:58.634 --> 01:20:00.472
<i>It was wonderful.</i>

01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:02.370
Adolescence.

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:04.206
I think that's what
I'm going through now.

01:20:04.206 --> 01:20:05.907
And I think
that's a positive term

01:20:05.907 --> 01:20:07.809
as opposed to a negative one.

01:20:07.809 --> 01:20:11.080
And I think it will make me
a better actress.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.983
MARY: <i>I dated, I made friends.
I had a little apartment.</i>

01:20:14.983 --> 01:20:16.886
<i>I did my own shopping.</i>

01:20:16.886 --> 01:20:20.225
<i>I sort of played house,
but in real life.</i>

01:20:22.293 --> 01:20:24.125
New Yorkers
are really very friendly.

01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:25.493
I get truck drivers and cabbies,

01:20:25.493 --> 01:20:29.564
"Hey, Mar, it's good to see you.
Love the show." (CHUCKLES)

01:20:29.564 --> 01:20:34.670
MARY: <i>You're in it, in humanity
and all kinds of people,</i>

01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:37.339
<i>not just one class of people.</i>

01:20:37.339 --> 01:20:39.609
<i>Because Grant was so much
a part of my life,</i>

01:20:39.609 --> 01:20:41.043
<i>I felt no need for friends</i>

01:20:41.043 --> 01:20:42.878
<i>except those people
with whom I was working.</i>

01:20:42.878 --> 01:20:45.080
<i>But now, I have many friends.</i>

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.417
TREVA: <i>Her humor
didn't come out so much in L.A.</i>

01:20:48.417 --> 01:20:52.315
<i>But in New York, she was loose,
and free and funny,</i>

01:20:52.315 --> 01:20:54.990
<i>which was adorable.</i>

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:58.463
BILL: <i>Everybody wanted
to take out Mary Tyler Moore.</i>

01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:00.829
RONA: <i>Are you dating?</i>

01:21:00.829 --> 01:21:03.498
MARY: <i>Oh, I hate that word.</i>
(CHUCKLING)

01:21:03.498 --> 01:21:07.002
I see people.
I go out to dinner with people.

01:21:07.002 --> 01:21:10.738
I travel with people
and I consider them my friends.

01:21:10.738 --> 01:21:14.577
MICHAEL: <i>We had a relationship
while the show was going on.</i>

01:21:14.577 --> 01:21:16.078
<i>We were helping each other.</i>

01:21:16.078 --> 01:21:19.114
<i>I was trying to make her
really good in the play.</i>

01:21:19.114 --> 01:21:22.884
<i>There was a part of Mary
which was absolutely delightful</i>

01:21:22.884 --> 01:21:24.219
<i>and very funny.</i>

01:21:24.219 --> 01:21:26.849
<i>But then,
there was another part of her,</i>

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:30.859
<i>which was nervous as a person
who is wondering</i>

01:21:30.859 --> 01:21:32.664
<i>if they've made
the right choice.</i>

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:39.368
PRESENTER:
<i>A good evening and welcome</i>

01:21:39.368 --> 01:21:43.138
<i>to the 34th annual presentation
of the Tony Awards.</i>

01:21:43.138 --> 01:21:44.974
The ultimate test
for a performer

01:21:44.974 --> 01:21:46.408
is the naked stage.

01:21:46.408 --> 01:21:49.377
It takes courage for someone
who's made a successful career

01:21:49.377 --> 01:21:51.613
in another medium
to chance this.

01:21:51.613 --> 01:21:55.517
So, when someone does
take a chance and brings it off,

01:21:55.517 --> 01:22:00.092
she, in this case,
she wins our respect.

01:22:01.092 --> 01:22:03.124
The people who administer
the Tony Awards

01:22:03.124 --> 01:22:05.360
have this year in their wisdom

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:10.031
decided to give a special award
to Mary Tyler Moore.

01:22:10.031 --> 01:22:13.072
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

01:22:25.016 --> 01:22:28.083
This, um, will symbolize for me

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:31.186
forever the absolute joy
in creative risk-taking.

01:22:31.186 --> 01:22:33.088
It's the essence of live theater

01:22:33.088 --> 01:22:36.925
and I am so very proud to be now
a part of that community.

01:22:36.925 --> 01:22:39.394
My deepest thanks
to Manny Azenberg

01:22:39.394 --> 01:22:41.462
for inviting me
and to all of you

01:22:41.462 --> 01:22:45.734
for this very warm welcome.
I love the neighborhood.

01:22:45.734 --> 01:22:47.139
Thank you.

01:22:55.279 --> 01:22:56.912
MICHAEL: <i>At one point,
Mary wanted</i>

01:22:56.912 --> 01:22:58.679
<i>an exclusive relationship</i>

01:22:58.679 --> 01:23:00.715
<i>but then she said,
"But I don't know what I mean."</i>

01:23:00.715 --> 01:23:03.085
<i>It wasn't like she wanted
to get married again.</i>

01:23:03.085 --> 01:23:04.819
<i>There was the issue,</i>

01:23:04.819 --> 01:23:09.224
<i>which was an occasional issue
then of Mary's drinking.</i>

01:23:09.224 --> 01:23:12.360
<i>One vodka on the rocks
at dinner, she'd be great.</i>

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.796
<i>Two vodkas on the rocks, same.</i>

01:23:14.796 --> 01:23:18.266
<i>But usually if she had
a third cocktail and some wine,</i>

01:23:18.266 --> 01:23:21.603
<i>she got slightly belligerent.
She'd lose concentration.</i>

01:23:21.603 --> 01:23:25.675
<i>And so whatever conversation
you were having</i>

01:23:25.675 --> 01:23:27.376
<i>might take a wrong turn.</i>

01:23:27.376 --> 01:23:30.412
MARY: <i>I found myself
not going out after five o'clock</i>

01:23:30.412 --> 01:23:34.182
<i>and making sure that everything
was set up for me near the phone</i>

01:23:34.182 --> 01:23:35.450
<i>that was near the television.</i>

01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:38.153
<i>And that I had my blender
full of drinks</i>

01:23:38.153 --> 01:23:39.554
<i>that I was concocting</i>

01:23:39.554 --> 01:23:43.024
<i>in an attempt to do something
worthwhile in the kitchen.</i>

01:23:43.024 --> 01:23:44.960
(CHUCKLING)
<i>It was a pretty sad lady</i>

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.494
that was emerging.

01:23:46.494 --> 01:23:48.396
LETTERMAN: I saw
this movie, <i>Ordinary People.</i>

01:23:48.396 --> 01:23:50.833
What a-- It's a killer.
It's just terrific.

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:52.233
- Thank you very much.
- And...

01:23:52.233 --> 01:23:54.369
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

01:23:54.369 --> 01:23:55.971
Did you have to wait in line
for a long time?

01:23:55.971 --> 01:23:57.776
I waited in line
for about an hour.

01:23:58.877 --> 01:24:00.810
- (GASPS)
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24:00.810 --> 01:24:02.244
Don't do that.

01:24:02.244 --> 01:24:04.714
Who had the foresight to say,
"She'd be great"?

01:24:04.714 --> 01:24:06.114
Well... Bob Redford, um...

01:24:06.114 --> 01:24:07.816
told me that when he had
first read the book

01:24:07.816 --> 01:24:09.218
in galley form,
four years before

01:24:09.218 --> 01:24:11.152
he had envisioned me
as... as the mother

01:24:11.152 --> 01:24:12.521
before he knew
he was going to...

01:24:12.521 --> 01:24:15.123
buy the... the property
and make a movie.

01:24:15.123 --> 01:24:17.592
And he said also that he had
always been fascinated

01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:20.824
by what might be the dark side
of Mary Tyler Moore.

01:24:20.824 --> 01:24:22.364
because in most
everything I've done,

01:24:22.364 --> 01:24:24.299
it's been sunny, and open,
and optimistic.

01:24:24.299 --> 01:24:27.068
And he knew, that little devil,
that there... (CHUCKLES)

01:24:27.068 --> 01:24:29.671
...there was a lot
of other stuff happening.

01:24:29.671 --> 01:24:31.306
ROBERT REDFORD:
<i>I had a place in Malibu.</i>

01:24:31.306 --> 01:24:33.175
<i>I was sitting there
just looking out the ocean</i>

01:24:33.175 --> 01:24:34.542
<i>and suddenly
this woman walks by.</i>

01:24:34.542 --> 01:24:37.079
<i>What it looked like to me
was that she was sad.</i>

01:24:37.079 --> 01:24:39.614
<i>I said,
"Oh, that's Mary Tyler Moore."</i>

01:24:39.614 --> 01:24:41.682
<i>And we had always seen
Mary Tyler Moore as this</i>

01:24:41.682 --> 01:24:45.020
<i>happy-go-lucky, upbeat,
wonderful, wonderful character</i>

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.222
<i>who was full of joy
and innocence.</i>

01:24:47.222 --> 01:24:52.394
In the film,
Beth's... barrenness of emotion

01:24:52.394 --> 01:24:54.866
derives from the fact
that she lost her son Buck

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:57.060
in an accident

01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:00.335
<i>and that she can't deal
with the surviving son</i>

01:25:00.335 --> 01:25:02.805
<i>because of what
this has done to her.</i>

01:25:02.805 --> 01:25:04.206
- CALVIN: That is great.
- Do it.

01:25:04.206 --> 01:25:06.408
- Calvin.
- Just a second. Smile.

01:25:06.408 --> 01:25:08.476
- Calvin. Give me the camera.
- No, I didn't get it yet, Beth.

01:25:08.476 --> 01:25:10.478
- Come on, give me the camera.
- Dad, give her the camera.

01:25:10.478 --> 01:25:12.447
MARY:
<i>That was such a change of pace</i>

01:25:12.447 --> 01:25:15.417
<i>that a woman
could be so brittle inside</i>

01:25:15.417 --> 01:25:19.120
<i>that she could alienate her son.
I saw her as a victim.</i>

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.559
All right. What do you think?

01:25:22.727 --> 01:25:23.691
Very nice.

01:25:23.691 --> 01:25:26.728
<i>I saw her as very reminiscent
of my own life.</i>

01:25:26.728 --> 01:25:29.331
If it's starting all over again,
the lying, the covering up,

01:25:29.331 --> 01:25:30.432
the disappearing for hours,

01:25:30.432 --> 01:25:31.766
I will not stand for it.
I can't stand it.

01:25:31.766 --> 01:25:34.502
- I really can't.
- Well, don't then, go to Europe.

01:25:34.502 --> 01:25:36.538
ROB: <i>When I saw her
in</i> Ordinary People,

01:25:36.538 --> 01:25:39.374
<i>I thought
that's more like who she is.</i>

01:25:39.374 --> 01:25:41.877
<i>She didn't want
to talk about things</i>

01:25:41.877 --> 01:25:43.645
<i>that were uncomfortable.</i>

01:25:43.645 --> 01:25:46.248
JOHN: <i>I'd seen some of that
in Mary</i>

01:25:46.248 --> 01:25:49.118
<i>in her more serious moments
with my father.</i>

01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:52.424
<i>I'd seen that pensiveness,
the hand wringing.</i>

01:25:53.624 --> 01:25:56.291
You drink too much
at parties, Calvin.

01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:59.662
JOHN: <i>I'd seen anger,
hurt, confusion,</i>

01:25:59.662 --> 01:26:02.932
<i>the inability
to connect with Rich.</i>

01:26:02.932 --> 01:26:04.536
<i>I'd seen flashes of that.</i>

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:13.074
You were, uh, loved and adored
as Mary Richards,

01:26:13.074 --> 01:26:15.544
who was anything
but what Beth is.

01:26:15.544 --> 01:26:17.712
And now you're loved and adored

01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:20.415
because you're just
kind of a... a nas--

01:26:20.415 --> 01:26:22.017
- Not a nasty person, but--
- MARY: I don't know

01:26:22.017 --> 01:26:23.518
if I'm loved and adored.

01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:25.286
In times past,
people would come up to me

01:26:25.286 --> 01:26:27.156
in the street and say,
"Hey Mar, how are you?"

01:26:27.156 --> 01:26:29.358
Now, they're going, "Ah, hi."

01:26:29.358 --> 01:26:31.626
(CHUCKLES)

<i>of life mirroring art...</i>

01:26:37.767 --> 01:26:40.639

<i>the death of that son

01:26:51.179 --> 01:26:53.382
<i>to determine if 24-year-old
Richard Meeker</i>

01:26:53.382 --> 01:26:55.420

MARY: <i>He died in an accident
with a gun.</i>

01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:08.863
JOHN: <i>The reports
that it had been a suicide</i>

01:27:08.863 --> 01:27:12.700
<i>would further cause anguish
and it just was so unfair.</i>

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:16.439
<i>There was no doubt in my mind
from the very beginning</i>

01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:18.506
<i>that that was an accident.</i>

01:27:18.506 --> 01:27:22.381
<i>I knew Rich,
I knew he could be... careless.</i>

01:27:23.548 --> 01:27:25.246
<i>He loved life too much.</i>

01:27:25.246 --> 01:27:28.817
<i>He was a really lovable goof.</i>

01:27:28.817 --> 01:27:33.784
<i>He explored. He loved people.
He had a huge heart.</i>

01:27:33.784 --> 01:27:35.524
<i>Yet he had a side of him</i>

01:27:35.524 --> 01:27:37.759
<i>that was just a little
accident prone.</i>

01:27:37.759 --> 01:27:40.462
MARY: <i>He had a gun collection.
He was lying on his bed</i>

01:27:40.462 --> 01:27:42.534
<i>and he was fooling
with one of them.</i>

Richie had already died</i>

<i>when she played that role.</i>

01:27:50.072 --> 01:27:55.480
<i>And then it turned out
that life imitated art, sadly.</i>

RONA: There are people

and then they stop living.

01:28:54.569 --> 01:28:57.472
They don't know how to go on.
They don't know how to cope,

01:28:57.472 --> 01:29:00.209
and they don't know
how to make the next step.

01:29:00.209 --> 01:29:01.914
Yeah, well,
he would've hated that.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.484
He would not have wanted
that to happen.

01:29:09.854 --> 01:29:11.056
I'm still angry.

01:29:12.691 --> 01:29:14.859
I haven't quite reconciled it.

01:29:15.655 --> 01:29:17.225
Um...

01:29:17.225 --> 01:29:20.532
I don't have
a religious belief that...

01:29:22.094 --> 01:29:24.469
I can rely on that says,
"Well...

01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:28.303
we are here on earth to put--

01:29:28.303 --> 01:29:30.109

and it was Rosh Hashanah

01:31:16.445 --> 01:31:18.748
He was at temple.
But there was a Dr. Levine,

01:31:18.748 --> 01:31:21.183
who for whatever
his own personal reasons,

01:31:21.183 --> 01:31:22.483
<i>was not at temple.</i>

01:31:22.483 --> 01:31:24.687
ROBERT: <i>I was the only
Jewish doctor working.</i>

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:27.957
<i>I really didn't know
who Mary was.</i>

01:31:27.957 --> 01:31:30.625
MARY: <i>So, we took her
over to Mount Sinai Hospital</i>

01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:32.322
and while he gave her
the once over,

01:31:32.322 --> 01:31:34.864
- I did the same to him. (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHS)

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:36.498
- MARY: And... and thought...
- Mary!

01:31:36.498 --> 01:31:39.268
Well, now,
exactly my very words, Sarah,

01:31:39.268 --> 01:31:40.769
- "Mary!"
- Okay.

01:31:40.769 --> 01:31:42.838
Because I was a few years older
than he

01:31:42.838 --> 01:31:45.040
and, well, probably still am.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.842
ROBERT: <i>I went to her apartment
a couple days later</i>

01:31:47.842 --> 01:31:50.645
<i>just to examine her mom.
Her mom was doing well.</i>

01:31:50.645 --> 01:31:53.343
<i>So, I said, "You're clear
to go back to Los Angeles."</i>

01:31:53.343 --> 01:31:55.050
<i>Mary then said,
"You know, Dr. Levine,</i>

01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:58.219
<i>I haven't been feeling
that well either.</i>

01:31:58.219 --> 01:31:59.925
<i>Could you listen to my chest?"</i>

01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:03.791
<i>As I was leaving,
I said to Mary,</i>

01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:06.526
<i>"If anything comes up,
just give me a call."</i>

01:32:07.198 --> 01:32:08.230
<i>So, Mary said,</i>

01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:12.234
<i>"Is acute loneliness
a good enough reason to call?"</i>

01:32:12.234 --> 01:32:14.269
<i>And I said, "I can't think
of a better reason</i>

01:32:14.269 --> 01:32:15.838
<i>to be awakened at 3:00 a.m."</i>

01:32:15.838 --> 01:32:16.705
(RINGING)

01:32:16.705 --> 01:32:18.040
BEVERLY: <i>She called me
on the phone</i>

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.741
<i>at 2:00 in the morning
and she said,</i>

01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:22.543
<i>"I have just met
the most wonderful man."</i>

01:32:22.543 --> 01:32:24.579
<i>I said, "It's two o'clock
in the morning."</i>

01:32:24.579 --> 01:32:27.750
<i>She said, "He's just wonderful.
He's young."</i>

01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:30.051
<i>And I said, "So?"</i>

01:32:30.051 --> 01:32:32.721
ROBERT: <i>So, a few days later,
3:00 a.m., she did call me,</i>

01:32:32.721 --> 01:32:35.723
<i>and she said to me,
"Do you cook?"</i>

01:32:35.723 --> 01:32:37.993
<i>And I lied and said, "No."
And so she said,</i>

01:32:37.993 --> 01:32:40.095
<i>"Well, I guess we'll have to go
out to dinner."</i>

01:32:40.095 --> 01:32:42.164
BEVERLY: <i>The minute he came
into Mary's life,</i>

01:32:42.164 --> 01:32:45.137
<i>she fell in love
for the first time in her life.</i>

01:32:48.305 --> 01:32:50.205
<i>I wasn't well equipped</i>

01:32:50.205 --> 01:32:53.108
<i>to have a first date
with someone like Mary</i>

01:32:53.108 --> 01:32:55.910
<i>because I wasn't a person
who dated at all.</i>

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:59.214
<i>I didn't have any moves,
if you will. I had no game.</i>

01:32:59.214 --> 01:33:01.720
<i>I think that was what Mary
may have liked about me.</i>

01:33:04.722 --> 01:33:07.255
Welcome to Malibu East...

01:33:11.761 --> 01:33:14.330
- That's my mom.
- Beautiful downtown Quehog.

01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:15.597
Are you good, Pam?

01:33:15.597 --> 01:33:16.932
PAM: Yeah.
Now, I'm taking pictures.

01:33:16.932 --> 01:33:18.634
- MARY: Dad, take a picture of--
- No, keep it, Pam.

01:33:18.634 --> 01:33:21.106
- MARY: This is Robert.
- Hello.

01:33:22.206 --> 01:33:24.539
ROBERT: <i>So, Mary was 18 years
older than me.</i>

01:33:24.539 --> 01:33:27.676
<i>I was an old man
by the time I met her.</i>

01:33:27.676 --> 01:33:30.012
<i>And she was still a young woman.</i>

01:33:30.012 --> 01:33:31.781
MARY:
<i>So, Robert is a very old soul.</i>

01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:33.148
<i>And I'm probably the baby.</i>

01:33:33.148 --> 01:33:35.117
<i>I'm the brat
of the relationship.</i> (CHUCKLING)

01:33:35.117 --> 01:33:38.020
But that's really not true.
Um, that's a joke.

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:41.484
Well, the truth is
that I have always depended

01:33:41.484 --> 01:33:44.392
on an older, stronger influence
in my life,

01:33:44.392 --> 01:33:46.028
whether it was husband
or father.

01:33:46.028 --> 01:33:48.063
<i>And there came a time
in my life,</i>

01:33:48.063 --> 01:33:50.232
<i>coincidentally just when I met Robert</i>

01:33:50.232 --> 01:33:51.233
<i>and the magic was there</i>

01:33:51.233 --> 01:33:54.736
<i>that I was ready
to be my own person.</i>

01:33:54.736 --> 01:33:57.372
<i>So, with Robert,
it was an opportunity to say,</i>

01:33:57.372 --> 01:34:01.537
"Okay, now this is truly equal.
You got nothing to fear here

01:34:01.537 --> 01:34:03.945
'cause, look, how much younger
he is than you.

01:34:03.945 --> 01:34:07.082
You have the experience now."
It always appears that I've been

01:34:07.082 --> 01:34:09.284
vitally independent
but not truly

01:34:09.284 --> 01:34:12.054
in my private life,
I was very much a person

01:34:12.054 --> 01:34:14.389
who liked being directed
and led.

01:34:14.389 --> 01:34:16.825
RONA: Does Mary Tyler Moore
wanna get married again?

01:34:16.825 --> 01:34:20.399
I don't think so. No.
I don't see any need for that.

01:34:22.599 --> 01:34:25.700
We're doing this roast
for Mary Tyler Moore

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.538

she'll be Mary Tyler Levine.

- Yes, I am.

01:34:33.408 --> 01:34:37.012
Okay. So, who will start? Betty.

01:34:37.012 --> 01:34:40.783
Betty White will now start
with the roast potatoes.

01:34:40.783 --> 01:34:42.484
BETTY:
It's not a roast, it isn't.

01:34:42.484 --> 01:34:43.819
- It's a paean.
- BEVERLY: It's ham!

01:34:43.819 --> 01:34:46.254
BETTY: It's a paean
of... of gratitude.

01:34:46.254 --> 01:34:49.689
It's a... It's a thing
that we should all...

01:34:50.495 --> 01:34:51.587
We all wanna do...

01:34:51.587 --> 01:34:53.060
- Pretend to do.
- ...but we just don't know how.

01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:55.964
No, we don't have to pretend,
darling. We love you very much.

01:34:55.964 --> 01:34:58.667
And as far as I'm concerned,

01:34:58.667 --> 01:35:01.464
I have answered
so many questions

01:35:01.464 --> 01:35:04.706
about my career,
about how do I realize

01:35:04.706 --> 01:35:07.042
how much Mary did for my career?

01:35:07.042 --> 01:35:07.976
Oh, Christ.

01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:10.378
- And I say, yes, I do!
- Forgive me, Robert.

01:35:10.378 --> 01:35:11.480
I didn't mean that. (CHUCKLES)

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.883
BETTY: But what? No, no.

01:35:13.883 --> 01:35:15.150
I'm so glad
we have holes in this.

01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:16.552

He got up at 12

and made a tuna fish sandwich.
Not for him and me but for me.

01:39:14.626 --> 01:39:16.491

that tuna fish sandwich...
