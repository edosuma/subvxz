Time to go.

22:25.475 --> 22:28.102
[screaming]
[music]

22:28.186 --> 22:30.355
Push me through!
Push me through!

22:33.066 --> 22:37.200
All right, pull yourself together, Vic.
You can handle this.

22:37.737 --> 22:40.198
Dragon on your shirt.
Dragon on your shirt.

22:40.281 --> 22:43.076
Dragon on your shirt.
Dragon on your shirt, man.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.286
Breathing fire!

22:45.370 --> 22:47.789
[snorts deeply]

22:52.293 --> 22:54.045
- [gunshot]
- [Vic] Whoo!

22:54.128 --> 22:56.846
- I can quit any time I want!
- [gunshots]

22:57.382 --> 22:59.384
- [glass shatters]
- # Lick that pickle, baby #

22:59.467 --> 23:01.552
- # Pull it from a jar #
- [gunshot]

23:04.597 --> 23:06.182
I think he's dead.

23:06.265 --> 23:09.268
- Better pee on him just to be sure.
- [Jimmy] No...

23:09.352 --> 23:10.937
<i>[all] Ah!</i>

23:11.020 --> 23:13.314
He's alive! Run!

23:13.398 --> 23:16.734
Guys, wait!
We got to take him to the hospital!

23:16.818 --> 23:17.985
We ain't going to no doctor.

23:18.069 --> 23:20.071
They want to vassinate us.

23:20.154 --> 23:22.310
I don't like clean needles!

23:23.449 --> 23:24.409
God damn it.

23:24.492 --> 23:27.203
Don't worry, Jimmy.
I won't let you die.

23:28.413 --> 23:29.414
[groans]

23:29.497 --> 23:30.748
Coma punch.

23:31.684 --> 23:34.490
[panting]

23:35.586 --> 23:37.880
My name is Bill Murphy,
and my friend had an accident,

23:37.964 --> 23:41.008
and it's all my fault.
I was trying to play a trick on him.

23:41.092 --> 23:43.219
Well, for corn sakes!
We'll take care of him.

23:43.302 --> 23:46.264
Just tell me, what kind of acid
did you pour on his face?

23:46.347 --> 23:48.724
None. That's the way he always looks.

23:48.808 --> 23:51.853
- Oh, dear.
- Fuck you, lady.

23:52.895 --> 23:54.313
[Sue] I can't believe you!

23:54.397 --> 23:56.649
This is a competition?

23:56.732 --> 23:59.026
That you're trying to win?

23:59.110 --> 24:01.863
You know, I went to a poker night
once without telling Jan and...

24:01.946 --> 24:05.867
Shut up, Clark!
I spent 15 years raising your children,

24:05.950 --> 24:08.265
and the one time I try to do something

24:08.266 --> 24:10.580
that makes me feel good about myself,

24:10.663 --> 24:13.749
you don't want me to get it
because it threatens you?

24:13.833 --> 24:15.835
How could you say that?

24:15.918 --> 24:17.837
You were the one who wanted me
to go deeper, Sue!

24:17.920 --> 24:20.006
Well, congratulations!

24:20.089 --> 24:22.842
You dig for oil,
sometimes you hit a sewer pipe!

24:22.925 --> 24:25.449
And now it's all out there!

24:28.097 --> 24:28.931
So...

24:31.100 --> 24:33.186
who wants to puke up their life next?

24:39.442 --> 24:41.527
[inhales]
I like dick.

24:42.528 --> 24:44.572
- What?
- I like dick, Ginny.

24:44.655 --> 24:47.867
I like looking at it. I like stroking it.
I like sucking it.

24:47.950 --> 24:50.453
You know when I get
that far away look in my eyes?

24:50.536 --> 24:51.913
I'm thinking about dick.

24:51.996 --> 24:54.332
I'm getting aroused now
just talking about it.

24:54.415 --> 24:55.541
I want it.

24:55.625 --> 24:58.586
I want dick more
than I want world peace.

25:03.508 --> 25:07.720
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm a homosexual, Ginny!

25:07.803 --> 25:11.057
I've been living a lie.
And so have you.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.643
I'm so sorry, but that's who I am.

25:14.727 --> 25:18.606
- No, you are not.
- Ginny, listen to me.

25:18.689 --> 25:21.943
Now, I'm gonna go outside
to look at constellations.

25:22.026 --> 25:27.073
You have exactly five minutes
to stop playing this silly game.

25:27.657 --> 25:31.744
- Just divorce me, my darling!
- [Ginny] No way, mister!

25:41.170 --> 25:46.133
Mr. Toad, did I dream that,
or did I really shoot up my house?

25:46.217 --> 25:47.802
No dream. You shot it up.

25:48.469 --> 25:50.596
Ah, shit, man.

25:51.180 --> 25:52.682
Thanks for being honest.

25:52.765 --> 25:54.016

Hey, good luck getting your job back.
I sure hope you don't fail.

26:45.067 --> 26:46.902
See, wasn't that hard, was it?

26:46.986 --> 26:49.280
Oh, here it comes.
Here it comes, the old...
