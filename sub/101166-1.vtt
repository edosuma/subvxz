then the idea is we become their partner.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.198
I acquired a Chevrolet agency that way.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.699
Then I started making a lot of money

in the gas business: $320,000."

06:39.524 --> 06:40.566
From that point on,

and ten million dollars a week.

investigations being conducted

08:30.843 --> 08:33.471

08:33.554 --> 08:37.099
but each of them had their own idea
about how to approach the problem.

08:37.183 --> 08:41.187
So, there was organized crime,
but very unorganized investigations.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.981
We had no strategy. We had no plan.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.115
[DeVecchio] When we would come across
somebody we didn't know,

08:53.199 --> 08:55.368
the only thing we could do
was take a photograph of them.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.121
Then we could go out to our informants
and say, "Do you know this guy?"

08:59.205 --> 09:01.332
They'd say, "Yeah, I know that guy."
"What's he do?

09:01.415 --> 09:04.126
What's his criminal activity?
Who's he connected with?"

09:04.210 --> 09:05.962
And then we'd put them on a board.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.923
We had a very, very good idea
of who was who

09:09.006 --> 09:12.134
and how the Mafia
was structured in New York.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.095
The five Italian
organized crime families were

09:14.178 --> 09:17.974
Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese,
Colombo, and Bonanno.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.935
The families were very structured.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.564
It started at the top with the boss,

09:24.647 --> 09:27.984
then you had the underboss,
who was really the second in command,

09:28.067 --> 09:30.861
and then you had
your <i>caporegimes, </i>captains,

09:30.945 --> 09:33.114
and then you had the soldiers under them.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.285
The way the families were structured
gave us a very powerful position.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.498
The biggest problem was that you could
never get to an underboss

09:42.582 --> 09:43.708
or the boss himself.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.378
They were too well-insulated
from whatever criminal activity was done.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.047
They had no connection with it whatsoever.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.302

committing the criminal acts

09:54.385 --> 09:56.429

up to the higher-ups.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.804
The government
was not controlling much of anything.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.434
That was the worst part about it.
People didn't believe that law enforcement

13:30.518 --> 13:32.853
could do anything about the Mafia.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.397
It was gonna be here forever.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.451
[thunder rumbles]

13:48.536 --> 13:50.704
[Kossler]
We had a meeting in Washington, D.C.,

13:50.788 --> 13:52.456
the Department of Justice.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.586
The director of the FBI said,
"What are we going to do about this?"

13:58.546 --> 14:00.089
[typewriter clacking]

14:11.392 --> 14:14.937
[man] At the time,
the FBI was totally unsuccessful.

14:15.980 --> 14:20.317
But we already had the perfect tools
to bring down the Mafia.

14:22.403 --> 14:27.533
The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act...

14:29.118 --> 14:31.078
commonly referred to as RICO,

14:31.161 --> 14:38.002
was a law that I wrote in 1970
to dismantle the Mafia, bosses and all.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.799
The FBI had this law for ten years
and didn't know how to use it.

14:45.509 --> 14:49.263
So I figured maybe what we could do
is have a training course

14:49.930 --> 14:51.265
at Cornell, right here.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.732
[Kossler] March of '79,
the boss wanted us to go

14:59.815 --> 15:02.484
to a seminar
at Cornell University Law School

15:02.568 --> 15:05.195
having to do
with organized crime problems.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.367
It was a week of spending time
away from the family.

15:10.451 --> 15:14.663
I wasn't really seeing what benefit
it was to me or to us.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.999
I went kicking and screaming,

15:17.082 --> 15:19.501
but as it turned out,
it would change everything.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.048
[Blakey] Question is, why RICO?

15:25.424 --> 15:29.094
You need to know what we had before RICO.

15:30.971 --> 15:36.060
Before RICO, we could arrest
the foot soldiers in the Mafia family

15:36.143 --> 15:39.063
for things like extortion,
murder, drug-dealing,

15:39.647 --> 15:42.733
but we had no way of tying...

15:43.734 --> 15:45.444
the foot soldiers to the bosses.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.701
I was telling them, "What you've gotta do
is take out the organization.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.787
And you're not gonna take out
the organization

15:54.870 --> 15:56.872
unless you focus on the organization."

16:00.918 --> 16:05.297
By defining these people as bosses
and members of this organization,

16:05.923 --> 16:07.967
they're now all joined together.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.138
Using RICO, a person can now be convicted

16:13.222 --> 16:16.558
because they ordered somebody
to commit a crime.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.312
So you could now prosecute
a group of people

16:20.813 --> 16:23.482
who had committed those crimes together.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.821
That way you can go after
the whole organization at one time.

16:31.031 --> 16:34.618
You need to be able to show
that this crime was related

16:34.702 --> 16:37.162
to an organization
that does crime the whole time.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.375
-The definition of power...
-[Kossler] Bob Blakey said,

16:41.458 --> 16:45.087
"You should prosecute
these Mob guys not as individual people,

16:45.170 --> 16:49.133
but as a group of people
committing crimes as a business."

16:52.052 --> 16:55.139
It was like an epiphany for me... a rush.

16:57.516 --> 17:02.396
Now I could see
how I could redirect the agents

17:02.479 --> 17:05.274
and make them understand
what we had to do.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.446
Now I knew how we could bring down
the entire New York Mafia.

17:14.283 --> 17:18.328
[clacking]

17:27.629 --> 17:29.256
[Kossler]
The plan was to develop a RICO case

17:29.339 --> 17:31.341
against each of the Five Families.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.306
Organized crime requires
organized investigation.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.226
We would have five Family squads,

17:41.310 --> 17:44.438
and all the information
about that particular Family

17:44.521 --> 17:46.398
would only go that one squad.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.861
[DeVecchio] Kossler brought us
into the conference room one day

17:50.944 --> 17:54.740
and said, "We're not leaving the room
until we have a written document

17:54.823 --> 17:58.952
of how we work... organized crime cases
under the RICO statute."

17:59.495 --> 18:02.081
We didn't know anything
about the RICO law, frankly,

18:02.164 --> 18:03.999
because we never used it.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.754
All of a sudden, people said,
"Wait a minute. I have all these cases

18:08.837 --> 18:10.756
involving all those people down here."

18:11.256 --> 18:15.469
"Close them, because we're only
gonna go after these people up here."

18:16.261 --> 18:18.472
[DeVecchio] You're talking
about a major operation:

18:18.555 --> 18:23.185
one squad per family, going after
the bosses of all Five Families.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.854
When he first broached that to me, I...

18:26.438 --> 18:28.690
I had my doubts. How're we gonna do that?

18:31.735 --> 18:34.738
The problem was that
no matter how hard you tried,

18:34.822 --> 18:37.991
it was very, very difficult
to get a cooperating witness.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.786
They were too afraid
to talk on the record.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.207
[typewriter clacking]

18:51.547 --> 18:52.881
[Franzese] We had a strict code.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.553
It was the main reason why the Mob
survived and prospered

18:57.636 --> 18:59.930
for well over a hundred years
in this country.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.686
I took the blood oath
on Halloween Night, 1975.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.315
The boss was seated at the head
of, like, a horseshoe configuration,

19:10.399 --> 19:12.276
and all the captains were
alongside of that.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.321
I held out my hand.
He took a knife, cut my finger.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.079
He took a picture of a saint,
put it on my hands, lit a flame...

19:25.247 --> 19:28.792
and he said, "Tonight, Michael Franzese,
you are born again into a new life."

19:34.089 --> 19:37.634
He said, "Betray your brothers
and you will die and burn in hell

19:37.718 --> 19:39.845
like this saint is burning in your hands."

19:41.388 --> 19:42.681
He said, "Do you accept?"

19:44.183 --> 19:45.058
"Yes, I do."

19:46.518 --> 19:47.936
Guys like myself...

19:48.437 --> 19:51.273
everybody on the street,
they knew, you become the witness,

19:51.356 --> 19:53.734
you're probably gonna pay
for it with your life.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.695
You feared the boss.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.698
You feared breaking the code.

20:04.077 --> 20:09.166
[man] <i>The Yankess are one game away</i>
<i>from ending the 1980 baseball season...</i>

20:09.249 --> 20:12.753
[Kossler] Someone who becomes
a member of the Mafia won't testify.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.379
It was a secret society.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.966
But we had a good solution
to a big problem.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.971
Without cooperating witnesses,
the plan was to start bugging the Mob.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.059
Put bugs in the places
where they operated.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.480
It might be a restaurant he frequents.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.402
It might be a car that he uses.
It might be his house.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.825
The ultimate goal was to record evidence

20:43.909 --> 20:46.578
that's coming directly
from the boss's mouth

20:46.662 --> 20:48.830
as to what criminal activity
he was involved in

20:48.914 --> 20:50.499
and who was in it involved with him.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.879
You can use that to bring
the whole organization down.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.260
That was gonna take a lot of manpower.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.264
I asked headquarters to send us 50 agents.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.767
The director said,
"Give New York whatever it needs."

21:08.850 --> 21:10.727
[typewriter clacking]

21:19.236 --> 21:20.612
[man] We started off on day one.

21:20.696 --> 21:24.324
I had the Gambino family.
It was one of the most powerful families.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.911
There were close to 21 captains,
over three hundred soldiers...

21:27.995 --> 21:29.413
thousands of associates.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.212
And the largest target was
Paul Castellano, the boss of the family.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.385
Castellano ran the family
like a Fortune 500 business.

21:44.094 --> 21:47.639
They called him the white-collar don
because he read <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

21:47.723 --> 21:49.474
He was very successful financially.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.728
But the most important thing
he understood was,

21:52.811 --> 21:54.354
in order to rule a crime family,

21:54.438 --> 21:56.982
you have to instill fear
in your soldiers and captains.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.484
And he had a bunch
of real tough guys around him

21:59.568 --> 22:01.486
who were like hit men for the Mob.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.452
[Alite] Paul Castellano was a boss.
We knew he was very wealthy.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.911
We knew we was very strong.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.456
He had 20-something guys killed.

22:12.956 --> 22:16.460
So when people say
he was a soft, white-collar criminal,

22:16.543 --> 22:20.672
that's the furthest thing from the truth.
I actually looked up to the guy.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.009
This is a guy who's smart enough
to kill the way had people killed,

22:24.092 --> 22:26.178
but yet not be called a killer.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.599
Because he is a killer.
It's just not by his own hand.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.356
[Mouw] He lived in a big house
on Staten Island.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.400
Our goal was to put a microphone there.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.153
Then when you play the tapes at trial,
your best witnesses are

22:43.236 --> 22:44.946
the criminals themselves, the mobsters.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.826
[Kossler] The problem was you cannot
bug anyone without a court order.

22:49.910 --> 22:53.663
I have got to come up
with enough information,

22:53.747 --> 22:57.334
either from surveillance
or from informants,

22:57.417 --> 23:00.754
that links Paul Castellano
to criminal activity.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.549
So the plan was to work our way up
from the bottom.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.135
We want the gossip in the family.
We want the blabbermouth,

23:07.219 --> 23:08.470
the guy who talks a lot.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.810
[woman] When I started
as an organized crime investigator,

23:14.893 --> 23:16.436
I was assigned to the Gambino squad.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.650
We were focused
on this small group in Queens.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.823
Bergin Hunt and Fish Club
was a Mafia social club

23:27.906 --> 23:30.659
where they hung out
and talked about their crimes.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.334
John Gotti was the captain
of this little den of thieves.

23:44.464 --> 23:49.469
This crew were kind of thuggish,
and they handled a lot of street rackets:

23:49.553 --> 23:53.265
loan sharking primarily,
and gambling, and bookie joints.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.225
And they were hijackers.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.810
That was the more violent crimes.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.605
[Alite] Bergin Hunt and Fish Club
was our Wall Street.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.693
When guys go to work on Wall Street,
they show up to the office,

24:04.776 --> 24:06.987
and we show up
to the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.989
And we wait for our boss, our CEO...

24:09.656 --> 24:10.490
John Gotti.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.328
I'm there 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

24:15.412 --> 24:17.456
on call for when that man wanted me.

24:18.498 --> 24:21.835
We're running numbers.
We're running drugs. We're running girls.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.503
Anything that's illegal.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.174
[Mouw] I tasked all the agents:

24:27.257 --> 24:30.427
"Let's find out what these guys are doing,
who's making all the money,

24:30.510 --> 24:32.095
and try to look for a weak link."

24:41.438 --> 24:45.108
[Alite] The FBI had an office very close
to the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.360
We were taught, especially by Gotti:

24:47.777 --> 24:50.113
"If they're around, they're around.
We know they're around,

24:50.197 --> 24:52.782
so, 'Hello, how are you?' Be cordial."
That's about it.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.999
[Mouw] We developed several
high-level informants in Gotti's crew

25:01.082 --> 25:03.960
through a variety of means.
Some were arrested, some we paid a lot.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.879
These guys provided a lot of information

25:05.962 --> 25:08.173
about who the weak links were
in that crew.

25:12.052 --> 25:17.265
[Alite] John's personal pit bull bodyguard
was a tough guy known to be very violent.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.852
He would do anything,
from making him tons of money

25:20.936 --> 25:22.812
to killing for him, to protecting him.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.815
His name was Angelo Ruggiero.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.911
[Mouw] Informants told us
that he was a big gossip.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.705
They called him "Quack Quack."
Not to his face.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.166
He ate a great deal.
And he talked a great deal.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.878
[chuckles]
So... his mouth was always in motion.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.048
Angelo was our blabbermouth.

25:53.885 --> 25:54.844
[Kossler] This was great.

25:54.928 --> 25:58.390
We went to the Attorney General
of the United States and got approval

25:58.473 --> 26:00.559
to put a bug in Angelo Ruggiero's house.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.686
We were off and running.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.229
[typewriter clacking]

26:15.574 --> 26:18.785
[man] A "black bag man"
was an agent who had a skill set

26:18.868 --> 26:21.913
for planting a concealed microphone

26:21.997 --> 26:23.957
or getting through a locked door.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.669
And that's basically
what was in the black bag of tricks.

26:29.004 --> 26:33.592
Many people don't operate
in a covert world effectively.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.843
They don't blend.

26:37.721 --> 26:41.099
The most successful agents
fit sort of my profile.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.311
Maybe I was a bad kid growing up.

26:44.394 --> 26:49.566
Maybe I learned how to hide and learned
how to blend and so on and so forth.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.821
My blending technique would
depend on the neighborhood.

26:54.904 --> 26:59.284
And generally speaking,
I'm just a local guy doing his job.

27:09.836 --> 27:14.007
In the Ruggiero case,
the house was always occupied.

27:14.090 --> 27:18.219
The neighborhood was too close
and there was never an opportunity

27:18.303 --> 27:22.140
that we could guarantee
the security of the entry team.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.894
So we came up with alternative options.

27:27.937 --> 27:31.274
Ruggiero's residence
had problematic wiring.

27:31.358 --> 27:35.362
His telephone service
would be out from time to time.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.946
We were just going to see

27:37.030 --> 27:40.367
if we could stretch that
into an opportunity to get in the house.

27:42.786 --> 27:47.624
The complaint goes in because he has
absolute legitimate trouble on his phone.

27:49.709 --> 27:55.465
We would ask the phone company
to not dispatch... and I would show up.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.402
[Cantamessa] Ruggiero's a little hostile.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.659
We were always concerned

28:22.742 --> 28:25.870
that they didn't trust
my undercover identity.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.710
But failure...

28:31.793 --> 28:33.545
honestly was not an option.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.937
I'm winging it.
I'm making this up as I'm going along,

28:52.021 --> 28:54.691
trying to read the pulse
of who I'm dealing with.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.163
Now I had an opportunity.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.686
We ran the wire to the back,

29:32.228 --> 29:33.438
and we're out of there.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.999
[Lucht] I was assigned to listen in
on Angelo Ruggiero's home.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.467
When you were assigned a shift,
you listened live.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.637
And you would listen to see
who his colleagues are

30:05.720 --> 30:08.723
and who he's in charge of
and who he reports to.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.851
He tried to be a little cryptic.

30:11.935 --> 30:16.815
So you were kind of trying to capture
the gist of what was being talked about.

30:23.988 --> 30:28.701
[Lucht] It was a total immersion
into the life of a Mafia household.

30:28.785 --> 30:32.914
So, I never heard so many creative uses
of the f-word in my life.

30:32.997 --> 30:37.252
[distorted speech on tape]

30:38.127 --> 30:41.422
[Lucht] If there were
some hot, pertinent conversations,

30:41.506 --> 30:45.093
then those things were immediately
turned over to the steno pool...

30:47.428 --> 30:49.973
who did their best to transcribe them.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.394
It was like some kind of soap opera.

30:54.978 --> 31:00.275
I got this impression that Angelo was
this kind of cranky, over-verbal guy

31:00.358 --> 31:01.526
who loved his kids.

31:01.609 --> 31:05.113
The kids were, um...
shall we say, a handful.

31:07.740 --> 31:11.619
He ran around and did a lot
of meat-handed management

31:11.703 --> 31:15.874
of all these crew members
in his Mafia crew and his family.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.041
[typewriter clacking]

31:24.424 --> 31:27.385
[Lucht] It was harder to understand
certain sections.

31:27.468 --> 31:32.098
So all the agents tended to get assigned
to reviewing these conversations

31:32.181 --> 31:35.977
in order to make the transcripts sensible.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.819
And so you listened again
and again and again.

31:45.361 --> 31:46.362
[indistinct speech]

31:49.407 --> 31:50.658
[indistinct speech]

31:54.829 --> 31:57.498
You were kind of trying
to put the puzzle together.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.543
I mean, it was a real slow-going art.

32:00.627 --> 32:01.544
[garbled speech]

32:06.883 --> 32:07.800
[garbled speech]

32:11.179 --> 32:12.013
[garbled speech]

32:19.187 --> 32:23.191
People on the squad had different input,
and they'd say, "Wait, I hear this,"

32:23.274 --> 32:25.485
and then you'd say, "Yeah, that's the key.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.362
That's what's going on in here."

32:44.420 --> 32:45.964
He would make reference to it.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.466
Did he get it? You know, did he <i>get </i>it?

32:50.093 --> 32:51.844
[tape deck clicks, rewinds]

33:02.772 --> 33:03.690
[garbled speech]

33:03.773 --> 33:07.276
We're sitting there like, "Well,
what is he talking about, you know?"

33:07.777 --> 33:10.989
You know, but then you had to put it
with who he's speaking to.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.366
Who was that
at the other end of that telephone?

33:15.576 --> 33:18.329
[garbled speech]

33:18.413 --> 33:20.373
[overlapping, garbled speech]

33:32.927 --> 33:35.471
[Lucht] And of course,
the FBI had technical abilities

33:35.555 --> 33:38.725
to track the phone, and over time,
you'd figure out who it is.

33:38.808 --> 33:42.687
And then when you put it together,
you'd say, he said, "Did you <i>get </i>it?"

33:42.770 --> 33:45.481
And he's talking to a guy
who is a big drug dealer.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.164
Here we are in the middle of the day.

34:01.247 --> 34:04.333
Angelo is talking
about two- or three-kilo heroin deals,

34:04.417 --> 34:07.837
while his wife and daughter
are a few feet away washing the dishes.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.382
[Lucht] We had gathered evidence

34:11.466 --> 34:15.720
that Angelo was a big-time,
multimillion-dollar heroin dealer.

34:18.347 --> 34:19.724
It was a big deal.

34:20.641 --> 34:25.438
But we still didn't have enough evidence
that links Ruggiero's criminal activity

34:25.521 --> 34:28.441
to Paul Castellano,
the boss of the Gambino family.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.288
[Mouw] For almost 6 months,
we followed him around

34:42.371 --> 34:44.832
so we knew where he went
for different meetings.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.049
We came to find out that he'd go up
to the boss of the family,

34:53.132 --> 34:55.551
Paul Castellano's house
on a regular basis.

34:57.303 --> 35:01.265
And then when the meeting was over,
Ruggiero would come back to his house.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.060
And other Mob guys would come over,

35:04.143 --> 35:07.188
and Ruggiero would tell them all about
what happened at the meeting.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.066
It's a big deal
to meet with the boss of the family.

35:11.901 --> 35:12.985
It's a dream come true.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.697
It's proof that Castellano was meeting
members of his crew at his house

35:16.781 --> 35:18.324
and talking criminal matters.

35:20.326 --> 35:24.080
This was the proof we wanted for approval
for electronic surveillance

35:24.163 --> 35:25.540
of Castellano's house.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.545
[Kossler] It was an unbelievable moment,

35:30.628 --> 35:34.423
because now we could finally bug
the boss's house.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.927
But it was gonna be
a very tricky operation.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.939
[Cantamessa] It was a big house.
It was referred to as the White House.

35:50.648 --> 35:55.528
The surveillance squad,
after many, many hours of surveillance,

35:55.611 --> 35:57.822
had come to the determination

35:57.905 --> 36:01.367
it's impossible
to get in there surreptitiously

36:01.450 --> 36:03.995
because the house was never empty.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.374
Castellano had lots of new things
in the house.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.710
He had the latest telephone equipment,

36:10.793 --> 36:12.670
and he had cable TV,

36:12.753 --> 36:17.300
specifically a CNN channel,
which was new at the time.

36:18.342 --> 36:22.555
[announcer] <i>Get in touch with the world.</i>
<i>Touch it. Get in touch with the news.</i>

36:22.638 --> 36:23.556
<i>Touch it.</i>

36:23.639 --> 36:28.269
<i>Get in touch when you want,</i>
<i>24 hours a day. CNN headline news.</i>

36:28.352 --> 36:31.314
[Cantamessa] We learned
all of his meetings and conversations

36:31.397 --> 36:35.610
took place
in his kitchen, dinning room area.

36:35.693 --> 36:39.780
That was where the TV was
and that looked like a real opportunity.

36:41.949 --> 36:46.329
So we started doing
a little homework on cable TV.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.872
<i>It's daybreak in the east.</i>

36:48.789 --> 36:51.334
<i>It's the 17th of May, good morning.</i>

36:52.126 --> 36:54.003
[Cantamessa] I learned it's very easy

36:54.086 --> 36:57.882
to introduce interference
in cable systems.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.675
<i>-Good morning--</i>
-[static crackles]

37:02.178 --> 37:05.056
[Cantamessa] So, we introduced
a problem into the house...

37:06.933 --> 37:08.768
annoying and aggravating enough

37:08.851 --> 37:12.230
that if somebody showed up
to troubleshoot a problem,

37:12.313 --> 37:13.731
they'd be happy to see them.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.194
I'm the cableman now.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.163
[Cantamessa] I ring the doorbell.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.207
Lots of chimes, as I recall.

37:36.462 --> 37:40.341
The gentleman that answers the door
happens to be Tommy Bilotti,

37:40.424 --> 37:41.926
Paul's right-hand guy.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.471
The guy was a killer.

37:50.226 --> 37:54.063
If something goes wrong,
I need to get out of here immediately.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.874
[reporter] <i>...residents of New York...</i>

38:16.544 --> 38:18.296
<i>...chemicals, as an earlier...</i>

38:18.379 --> 38:22.174
[Cantamessa] I'm calling into the office,
and they're going to test the line.

38:22.758 --> 38:26.262
I'm actually calling Art,
who is my other agent out there.

38:26.345 --> 38:28.431
And when I go,
"Art, I'm tapping on this."

38:28.514 --> 38:31.517
As I'm tapping, he's making interference.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.768
TV's blinking.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.731
<i>-...son, Jesus Christ...</i>
<i>-Get ready, Manhattan...</i>

38:36.814 --> 38:40.818
[Cantamessa] Preplanned, all orchestrated,
bench tested before I went.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.574
Including my level of uncooperativeness.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.619
I'm acting like
we have to come back.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.371
You have to make an appointment.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.041
They don't like appointments.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.292
So, no appointment.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.962
We're gonna do this.
We're gonna do this right now.

39:11.432 --> 39:12.767
I took a risk.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.437
I said, "If you give me a hand
for just a minute,

39:17.021 --> 39:18.689
I promise I'll be out of here."

39:19.190 --> 39:20.107
"What do you need?"

39:20.191 --> 39:23.986
I go, "Would you just come over here
and hold the flashlight for me?"

39:35.039 --> 39:38.959
So Tommy Bilotti helped me
while I installed the device

39:39.043 --> 39:41.087
that had the microphone in it.

39:46.133 --> 39:47.885
Microphone was active.

39:49.136 --> 39:53.182
They were glad to not have me be there
too long, and I was glad to leave.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.436
<i>You know what it takes to stop a crime?</i>
<i>Your help and your neighbors'.</i>

39:57.520 --> 39:59.313
<i>Take a bite out of crime.</i> [chomps]

40:09.782 --> 40:13.369
Everybody was just thrilled
with the successful installation

40:13.452 --> 40:17.748
of the wire in Paul Castellano's house.
I mean, that was just-- Wow.

40:20.292 --> 40:23.504
Your expectations are great.
You expect to hear about murder.

40:23.587 --> 40:27.716
Kill this guy and kill that guy.
It was a big day for the FBI.

40:28.717 --> 40:31.137
[indistinct speech]

40:33.139 --> 40:37.101
[Kossler] Paul Castellano, the boss
of the Gambino family, was on tape.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.561
This was really significant,

40:38.644 --> 40:42.898
in that he was the boss of one
of the largest families in the Mafia.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.819
People wouldn't even dream
about this ten years before.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.789
The sound of a Mafia kitchen,
you know what it is?

40:59.331 --> 41:01.792
It's eggs being beaten in a bowl.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.967
I don't recall listening
to any meetings with others.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.637
I just remember
Castellano and Gloria talking.

41:16.765 --> 41:20.978
Gloria was the maid
in this giant mansion that they had.

41:21.061 --> 41:24.190
She cleaned and cooked,
and she'd been there for quite a while.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.566
I got this impression.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.903
She had a certain amount of personality
and they clicked.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.780
You'd listen to this and you'd go,
"What is that?

41:31.864 --> 41:35.493
Alright, stop it here and back it up."
And the reels would go around.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.619
"Let's play it again."

41:42.625 --> 41:44.668
"Oh, God no! Oh, my God!"

41:45.503 --> 41:47.213
Everybody's suddenly realized

41:47.296 --> 41:50.341
he was having a torrid affair
with his maid.

41:51.675 --> 41:55.262
Poor Joe O'Brien had to be all tuned in
to that little soap opera.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.611
[man] My job was
to make a prosecutable case

42:10.694 --> 42:12.071
against Paul Castellano.

42:14.156 --> 42:16.992
I had people talking to me that didn't
even know they were informants,

42:17.076 --> 42:22.081
including Paul Castellano's
maid and lover, Gloria Olarte.

42:23.123 --> 42:24.542
She would we take pictures,

42:25.125 --> 42:29.088
family pictures and pictures of Castellano
meeting his associates.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.174
She gave me those photographs.

42:33.467 --> 42:34.969
But she was an unwitting source.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.846
She didn't know about the bug
in Castellano's house.

42:45.896 --> 42:49.733
[O'Brien] You listen to 600 hours' worth
of tapes, you get to know the guy.

42:49.817 --> 42:53.571
So... I did something a little unusual.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.664
I started sending him greeting cards.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.793
Birthday cards.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.213
Get well cards. I heard he was sick.

43:13.215 --> 43:16.427
I sent him a card:
"To a special godfather."

43:18.220 --> 43:20.889
I was messing with him.
This was psychological warfare.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.933
I wanted to see what they were made of.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.646
My partner Andy and I were listening
and had the headsets on.

43:28.355 --> 43:30.107
He talked about the greeting cards.

43:31.191 --> 43:34.820
A lot of profanity and everything.
Kind of funny when you listen to the guy

43:34.903 --> 43:37.323
and he's opening a card
and talking about you.

43:38.073 --> 43:42.119
That's when Gloria revealed
that she'd been meeting with me privately.

43:42.202 --> 43:43.954
And I figured, "Uh-oh."

43:46.832 --> 43:49.460
He scolded her like a little schoolgirl.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.420
"You don't meet with Mr. Joe anymore.

43:51.503 --> 43:54.173
You stay away from O'Brien.
You understand, Gloria."

43:55.716 --> 43:58.594
Castellano's bodyguard
started goading him.

43:58.677 --> 44:01.764
"We can get rid of this guy, O'Brien."

44:01.847 --> 44:04.933
They were goading Castellano
to put a contract out of my life.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.731
Scary people, you know.
They're murders. They're psychopaths.

44:12.858 --> 44:15.694
It was said that Castellano
could order somebody killed

44:15.778 --> 44:18.906
by just lifting an eyebrow.
Didn't have to say a word.

44:25.412 --> 44:28.290
If he had gone silent,
it would have been all over for me.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.297
But Castellano said, "No.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.134
Bring too much heat on the family.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.388
Just be careful, you know.
He's just doing his job."

44:42.471 --> 44:46.058
He defended me,
so I gotta give credit for that.

44:49.853 --> 44:53.816
But it didn't change the fact
that the whole object of my case

44:53.899 --> 44:56.985
was to put Castellano
in a federal prison for life.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.908
I started getting evidence
to implicate him.

45:06.745 --> 45:08.747
Castellano talked about
all kinds of things.

45:08.831 --> 45:12.668
He talked with Tommy Gambino
about dividing up the Garment District.

45:13.585 --> 45:17.881
He spoke with Joe N. Gallo about all
the various rackets they were involved in.

45:19.341 --> 45:22.803
He spoke with Joe Armone
about the restaurant union.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.204
[Kossler] We were hearing more and more

45:49.288 --> 45:51.623
about their involvement
with the labor unions.

45:53.041 --> 45:56.378
That was important information
because it showed the real problem

45:57.045 --> 45:58.839
of organized crime...

45:58.922 --> 46:03.927
that the organized crime groups controlled
the major labor unions in this country.

46:08.348 --> 46:12.478
We were hearing how the Mafia controlled
the Teamsters trucking union,

46:13.687 --> 46:14.855
the Laborers' Union,

46:16.231 --> 46:17.941
the longshoremen union,

46:18.484 --> 46:20.319
the hotel employees' union.

46:21.862 --> 46:25.073
There's so many ways
they used the unions to make money.

46:26.658 --> 46:29.995
They could extort companies
to give their friends jobs.

46:30.078 --> 46:31.914
They could give him health benefits.

46:35.334 --> 46:37.085
[Franzese] The Mob had a lot of power,

46:37.628 --> 46:39.213
because we controlled the unions.

46:40.255 --> 46:42.132
We call in a strike with the Teamsters,

46:42.216 --> 46:44.259
two and a half million people
stop working.

46:45.594 --> 46:46.845
That's a lot of power.

46:47.304 --> 46:50.224
Not to mention the pension funds
that you had at your disposal.

46:50.641 --> 46:53.018
You got hundreds of millions of dollars
sitting in the bank

46:53.101 --> 46:55.979
that you can move anywhere you want.
You control bankers that way.

46:56.063 --> 46:59.233
You control insurance companies that way.
And we used that.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.235
-[tape rewinding]
-[man]<i> And he gave me $5,000.</i>

47:01.318 --> 47:02.986
[indistinct chatter]
