00:01.251 --> 00:02.787
Previously on
"Designated Survivor”...

00:02.920 --> 00:05.958
| think the White House Counsel's office
has been vacant for far too long.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.830
| would be honored to work for you, sir.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.344
A silent alarm was tripped
at a private residence in Rockuville.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.589
[Damian] Who lives there?

00:12.721 --> 00:14.303
[Charles] The First Lady's mother.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.547
It sounded like the place
was being torn apart.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.596
And I want a detailed report
of everything that Lloyd touched, got it?

00:19.728 --> 00:23.016
My family?
He's coming after my family?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.889
The FBI conducted a drone strike.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.768
| can now confirm that Patrick Lloyd
has been neutralized.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.144
[Damian] They found Lloyd's computer.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.612
He was uploading something to the cloud
when the bomb hit.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.606
Do you know what it was?

00:36.745 --> 00:38.827
[vehicles passing,
man shouts indistinctly]

00:38.956 --> 00:40.663
[woman vocalizing]

00:41.500 --> 00:43.161
[woman] Yes, I told him.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.455
But you know men and their boats.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.793
[boy crying]

00:46.922 --> 00:48.458
I'll call you back, Jess.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.127
-What's wrong, honey?
-My mom.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.089
Ma'am?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.301
[gasps]

01:02.479 --> 01:03.514
[horn honks in distance]

01:05.649 --> 01:08.266
Hey, Mom, is something wrong
with the coffee?

01:08.402 --> 01:09.984
Yes. I didn't make it.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.318
Come on.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.528
| told you, you can use
the kitchen any time.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.489
Someone else's kitchen.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.365
Someone else's coffee.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.734
Eva, it's only been a weekend.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.531
It's gonna take you some time
to get settled.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.701
Besides,
the White House has 132 rooms,

01:22.833 --> 01:24.870
so if you're not happy
with the one you're in...

01:25.002 --> 01:26.163
You're so sweet.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.502
And a wonderful host. I just...

01:29.006 --> 01:30.212
| want to go home.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.708
Mom, your house is still
an active crime scene.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.506
Your son's bedroom
IS an active crime scene.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.721
My house is just a place
some lunatic broke into,

01:39.850 --> 01:41.887
and he's dead. And I'm not.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.228
| promise you, I give you my word
we'll get you home as soon as possible.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.813
Until then, know you have
the run of the place.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.027
And I appreciate it.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.061
Why do I get the feeling
that my mom likes you better?

01:54.197 --> 01:55.699
Because she likes me better.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.357
[telephone rings]

01:59.578 --> 02:00.909
Yeah?

02:01.538 --> 02:02.573
I'll be right there.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.122
[indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing]

02:05.250 --> 02:07.036
-[woman] Mr. President.
-Okay, what do we got?

02:07.169 --> 02:10.332
32 cases in the past 24 hours
in South Carroll Parish.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.750
That's 12 fatalities.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.465
-Which means thousands are infected.
-So, what's the CDC saying?

02:14.593 --> 02:16.504
-Is this as bad as Liberia?
-Worse.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.380
It's Influenza "A," likely avian origin.
Highly contagious.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.722
Short incubation period
facilitates the spread.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.262
Could this be the superbug
you've been worried about?

02:24.394 --> 02:25.600
Well, I might have an answer for that

02:25.729 --> 02:28.437
if the CDC had some money
for infectious-disease research.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.067
Just like when we were teaching
at Columbia.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.774
Always trying to squeeze blood
from a stone.

02:31.902 --> 02:35.611
But that was for faculty pensions.
This is about lives.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.230
-Show me.
-[computer beeping]

02:39.534 --> 02:42.117
This flu appears to be an H7N9 subtype.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.623
Like the Yangtze Delta flu.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.409
And no one here has immunity.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.116
How fast will it spread?

02:49.252 --> 02:52.165
Our simulation says the H7N9 will appear

02:52.297 --> 02:55.039
in surrounding states in 36 hours.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.462
In 72 hours...

02:57.594 --> 02:59.926
[computer pinging]

03:00.055 --> 03:01.295
...that's what it will look like.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.517
Oh, my God.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.134
[Emily] We have a shot at containment
because the area is so isolated.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.647
They didn't even have state roads
in some parts until the '70s.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.480
The FAA shut down all airports
in a 200-mile radius.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.190
Same for NHTSA and highways.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.980
And I told Governor LaSalle
that we're at his disposal.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.320
Okay, good. Aaron, I'm gonna
want you to be the liaison

03:18.448 --> 03:20.485
between the World Health
Organization and the UN.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.984
We also need to notify the Canadian
and Mexican authorities.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.329
HHS has activated the Strategic National
Stockpile of vaccines and antivirals,

03:26.456 --> 03:28.493
so hopefully one of them
will match this flu strain.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.786
Emily, bring Seth up to speed.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.159
As soon as word leaks out,
panic's gonna spread like wildfire.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.581
-Let's get on it.
-Yes, sir.

03:36.299 --> 03:40.964
100 years ago, the Spanish flu wiped out
5% of the world's population.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.427
How bad is this?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.672
I'll give you a call
when I have boots on the ground.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.014
All right.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.468
Tammy.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.105
Be careful.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.689
Yes, sir.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.941
[theme music]

04:09.332 --> 04:11.039
[Seth] So I just got off the phone

04:11.168 --> 04:13.660
with an infectious-disease
specialist at the CDC.

04:13.795 --> 04:18.334
This bug is a rapidly mutating pathogen
that accelerates its host's lytic cycle.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.377
English?

04:19.509 --> 04:21.591
Uh, it makes your cells explode.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.961
-Maybe don't tell the press that.
-Yep.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.556
Hey, um, did you leave me
a blueberry muffin?

04:27.684 --> 04:28.719
| did.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.384
That was really nice.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.228
Yeah, I picked out all the blueberries,
so don't make it a big deal.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.733
Well, I won't now.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.566
Oh, uh, that zoologist from
the National Museum wants to come by,

04:37.694 --> 04:40.561
the guy who's naming the animal after
the president. He wants a photo op.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.064
Bringing an alien species into
the White House while we're fighting

04:43.200 --> 04:45.737
a possible pandemic
that originated with animals is...

04:45.869 --> 04:46.734
a great idea.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.406
Hey, I just work here.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.654
Hey, new girl.
You getting up to speed?

04:50.791 --> 04:53.032
Trying. It's a little, uh...

04:53.168 --> 04:54.249
Intimidating?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.583
That's the word.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.419
Just remember
it's another office building.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.585
Whose halls were walked
by Lincoln, FDR and Kennedy.

05:00.717 --> 05:01.957
You'll get used to it.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.549
-[sighs] Really?
-No.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.385
We're starting you slow, though.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.551
Right. The Emmitt Akin statue.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.050
Yes, a simple Confederate monument
located on federal property.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.722
Some want to keep it.
Some don't.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.232
Well, a federal statue
means federal issue.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.847
This is really important
to the president.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.441
- I thought you were starting me slow.
-That is slow.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.276
[woman] How dare you?!
That is racist!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.896
[man] I've been telling you
for an hour, it is not racist!

05:24.032 --> 05:26.069
-[indistinct shouting]
-People, can we just...?

05:27.869 --> 05:28.904
-[whistles]
-No!

05:30.413 --> 05:33.246
We were making progress here.

05:34.668 --> 05:38.286
Look, Emmitt Akin was
the Mayor of Chattanooga.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.959
He's an historic figure
to many Tennesseans.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.584
That is the Southern Legacy
Foundation's whole point.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.221
He was also a slave holder

05:46.346 --> 05:49.088
who fought to preserve
an oppressive institution.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.091
The erection of his statue
post-Reconstruction

05:52.227 --> 05:54.935
is seen by many
as a monument to Jim Crow.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.430
The statue's smack dab in front
of the old federal courthouse.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.603
It's an official endorsement of racism.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.691
So we've agreed on a middle ground:

06:01.820 --> 06:04.187
to find a less-trafficked area
for the statue

06:04.322 --> 06:08.156
that still honors Tennessee history
while respecting the sensibilities

06:08.285 --> 06:11.152
of those who find it a reminder
of a painful past.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.451
The only party we haven't heard from
is Reverend Dale.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.290
[indistinct murmuring]

06:20.672 --> 06:24.415
| have spent my life leading protests.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.427
But this issue has caused me
great consternation.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.969
The statue is an emblem

06:33.101 --> 06:36.810
of a dark period in American history.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.306
It enshrines racism.

06:41.026 --> 06:46.647
So it is easy to view it
as a symbol of injustice.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.649
But I see it as a reminder,

06:51.494 --> 06:55.328
and our past must not be... whitewashed.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.783
The statue must not be moved.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.876
-[man] There you go.
-He doesn't want it touched, either!

07:01.004 --> 07:03.462
-Have you lost your mind?!
-[indistinct shouting]

07:05.300 --> 07:06.882
[computer beeping]

07:07.010 --> 07:09.342
-It makes no sense.
-Nope.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.555
Lloyd's on the run for six months,
and the last thing he does

07:13.683 --> 07:17.221
before he holes himself up in a bunker
is trash the First Lady's mother's house?

07:17.354 --> 07:18.515
Why?

07:18.647 --> 07:22.356
Because he wanted to show your president
that he could get to his family?

07:22.484 --> 07:27.570
Or - and, uh, just spitballing here -
because he was a psychopath.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.780
Personally, I'm much more interested
in what he was trying to upload.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.867
Look, Lloyd sent that file
across three continents four times

07:33.995 --> 07:37.579
before I located it in a cloud account
on an Australian server.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.699
It's so corrupted that I need to write
a program just to render it.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.870
Yeah.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.495
No problem. Glad you're on it.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.541
Yeah.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.166
So, you must miss London, huh?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.712
Always.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.262
-How long you here for?
-Well, that depends on Hannah.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.722
| can't tell my government
the threat he posed is over

07:55.850 --> 07:57.591
until your government says it is.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.311
And you being the lead investigator,
you're "your government.”

08:01.439 --> 08:03.726
My government says to keep digging.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.112
See you later!

08:08.363 --> 08:10.946
[sighs]
Much.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.815
[siren wails]

08:12.951 --> 08:15.659
Evidence-response team
tagged everything Lloyd touched.

08:15.787 --> 08:16.948
Why?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.787
He was throwing a tantrum.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.787
What if he wasn't?

08:22.919 --> 08:25.251
Whatever he did,
he always had a method.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.586
Lloyd was meticulous.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.752
He cut a clear pathway
through the house...

08:30.218 --> 08:32.424
and never doubled back.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.090
[pottery shatters]

08:48.611 --> 08:50.522
Every drawer in here is tossed
except for the desk.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.441
Did he run out of time?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.030
Or he wanted to lead us here.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.330
It's a medical record from 1987

09:06.463 --> 09:09.000
for a heart-transplant operation
for Andrew Booker.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.423
That's the First Lady's father.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.883
Why would Mrs. Booker leave
a 30-year-old file

09:14.012 --> 09:16.379
-just randomly lying on top?
-He left it here.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.131
He wasn't looking for something.
He was leaving us something.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.305
But why would he give a toss
about Andrew Booker's heart?

09:23.021 --> 09:25.183
| don't know. But I'm gonna find out.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.394
[alarm blares]

09:32.530 --> 09:34.316
-[groans]
-[radio chatter]

09:34.449 --> 09:35.564
[patients coughing, moaning]

09:35.700 --> 09:37.737
[monitors beeping]

09:40.789 --> 09:41.779
[Aaron] 10 more dead?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.327
And 11 more in the ICU hanging on.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.542
The mortality rate of the patients
in the hospital will be about 40%.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.832
Have we made any progress?

09:49.964 --> 09:50.999
No.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.089
The viral gestation cycle is short.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.131
The patient's lungs are damaged, and
the oxygen loss leads to organ failure.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.923
What about our antiviral stockpile?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.343
The South Carroll Parish strain
is resistant.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.011
What about creating a new vaccine?

10:02.143 --> 10:05.886
Even if you threw every brain
from the CDC at it, it would take months.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.763
But... I do have an idea.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.766
-We're all ears.
-I read an abstract recently

10:10.902 --> 10:12.859
about an experimental
cancer drug called Extasis

10:12.987 --> 10:14.523
with interesting antiviral properties

10:14.656 --> 10:16.567
that seem to reduce
the ability of viruses

10:16.699 --> 10:19.737
with a genome similar
to the H7N9 to replicate.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.735
So not a prevention but a treatment.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.737
That sounds promising.
Where do we get it?

10:23.873 --> 10:25.204
A guy named Carlton Mackie.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.701
He heads up this cutting-edge pharma firm
in Delaware called Benevax.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.248
-We're on it.
-Meantime,

10:30.380 --> 10:32.963
we need to widen the quarantine
to neighboring counties.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.798
This thing's getting away from us.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.465
[indistinct conversations]

10:39.597 --> 10:43.261
What kind of PR bump do you think
the president will get off of an animal?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.554
A small one.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.427
I'd prefer a constellation,

10:46.563 --> 10:49.146
but, uh, this is what you get
when you defund NASA.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.561
I'm gonna ask people to just
keep your voices down

10:51.693 --> 10:54.025
and, please, don't get too close
to the terrarium.

10:54.154 --> 10:58.773
From the Amazonian rainforest,
| present Hylidae kirkmanus.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.195
[all murmuring]
[frog croaks]

11:01.327 --> 11:03.489
What is it?
Where is it?

11:04.539 --> 11:07.406
No, no, no, no, no. You can't
name that thing after the president.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.455
-We already have.
-Don't you have something better?

11:10.587 --> 11:13.375
Like a... like a crested eagle
or a panther?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.372
It's not a flea market, Mr. Boone.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.170
Well, see, a flea would be better
"cause then, no one would see it.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.168
-You understand?
-Okay, sorry.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.215
Dr. Chen, I think what Lyor
is trying to say--

11:21.347 --> 11:23.964
-You and Kermit need to leave right now.
-Oh, we can't... Oh, don't--

11:24.100 --> 11:26.091
That's not gonna be possible
'cause it's already travelled

11:26.227 --> 11:29.470
6,000 miles in the last 3 days.
If I move it before it habituates

11:29.606 --> 11:31.438
to its new surroundings;
it could die of shock.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.432
Well, so could the president.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.730
Uh, so... how long, uh,
does he have to stay here?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.650
It's a hermaphrodite,
so it's not a "he."

11:38.781 --> 11:41.614
-Well, this gets better and better.
-Well, I can move it tomorrow.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.904
Great. Thank you so much.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.652
-What about a picture with the president?
-No, no.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.164
We'll see if
he's available in the schedule.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.280
He's not gonna be
available for that ever.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.073
-[frog croaks]
-[Chen sighs]

11:50.210 --> 11:52.076
[indistinct shouting]

11:52.212 --> 11:53.168
[muffled shouting]

11:53.296 --> 11:54.661
[sighs]

11:54.797 --> 11:57.175
Is Reverend Dale in there?
| was hoping to meet him.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.301
[shouting continues]

12:03.348 --> 12:04.429
I'll come back.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.797
[shouting continues]

12:05.934 --> 12:07.971
-[man] Oh, my God!
-[Lyor] Hey.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.230
-How's this thing going?
-Good.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.642
-[man] Screw you!
-[woman] Screw you, too!

12:12.774 --> 12:15.562
-Yeah. Sounds good.
-It's a contentious issue.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.149
Do you like frogs?

12:17.278 --> 12:18.234
Frogs?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.229
Exactly. No one does.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.197
So, uh, your thing...

12:22.325 --> 12:23.736
the, uh, Congressional Black Caucus

12:23.868 --> 12:25.859
and civil rights groups are
watching how we handle this.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.204
-A test case. I know. Emily told me.
-Did she mention the dovetailing optics?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.039
-Sorry?
-The outbreak.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.750
South Carroll Parish
is 76% African-American.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.041
So... people of color are dying
in one part of the country

12:37.173 --> 12:39.710
while racist monuments
are protected in another?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.128
No bueno.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.505
-I'm on it.
-[man] You are racist!

12:43.638 --> 12:45.879
-[woman] No, you're racist!
-Yeah.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.130
[chuckles]

12:47.267 --> 12:49.304
[indistinct shouting]

12:50.061 --> 12:51.893
Dr. Bruner is right.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.854
Extasis could work on H7N9.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.733
That's great.
Carlton, that's excellent news.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.398
You're suggesting an un-tested off-label
use not approved by the FDA.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.272
If it doesn't work,
if it Kills someone,

13:03.408 --> 13:05.695
Benevax's liability
could be catastrophic.

13:05.827 --> 13:09.695
| understand, which is why I had the
White House counsel's office draw this up.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.117
It's an indemnification.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.706
| appreciate that, Mr. President.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.748
But it will take my lawyers
weeks to vet this.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.165
We don't have weeks.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.962
We... we have hours. People are dying.
Carlton, I'm asking you to trust me.

13:24.887 --> 13:25.797
All due respect, sir,

13:25.930 --> 13:30.390
| have an obligation to my shareholders,
and I don't satisfy that obligation

13:30.518 --> 13:33.010
by saying somebody from
the government said, "Trust me."

13:33.146 --> 13:34.386
[chuckles]

13:34.522 --> 13:36.263
Even if that somebody
is the president.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.812
| respect that. Honestly, I-| do.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.811
But there are times in our society

13:42.947 --> 13:46.360
where we have to act in faith
on behalf of the greater good.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.734
And unfortunately,
this is one of them.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.911
| have 10,000 doses
in our Atlanta storage facility.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.910
Which may be enough
to contain this.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.912
| can have HHS
expedite the transfer

14:00.048 --> 14:02.665
-to South Carroll Parish.
-Okay.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.918
Carlton, thank you.
I-I know this isn't easy.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.923
Mr. President.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.803
-He did not look happy.
-No.

14:15.938 --> 14:20.023
Neither do the families in Louisiana
who are burying their loved ones.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.982
The First Lady's father died in 2002.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.321
Why would Lloyd
leave us a breadcrumb trail

14:27.450 --> 14:29.191
to an old medical document?

14:29.327 --> 14:32.865
Because if we find it, it's evidence,
and we're obligated to investigate it.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.830
Evidence of what? And that's
assuming it's not a plant.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.041
There's only one way to find out:
talk to the First Lady.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.332
-What are you gonna tell her?
-As little as possible.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.377
| don't want to drag her into this
if I'm following a Lloyd fabrication.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.969
Okay, so this is an invoice for my mom's
trip down the Danube

14:50.098 --> 14:52.510
with her friend Marlene
a couple years ago.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.059
Another old utility bill.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.303
She stockpiles them.
Don't ask me why.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.771
Agent Wells, is this really necessary?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.641
Yes, ma'am. It is. I'm sorry.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.018
We have to vet everything
that Patrick Lloyd touched.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.229
We need to close the loop.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.605
Wow!

15:09.200 --> 15:10.531
That's weird she kept this.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.150
What is it?

15:12.286 --> 15:15.529
It's the insurance form
for my dad's, um, heart transplant.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.030
He had a transplant?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.874
Yeah, it was one of the first
in the DC area, actually.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.413
I-I was only about 10.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.002
| don't remember a whole lot,

15:23.131 --> 15:26.374
but |-I do remember he was
far down on the recipient list,

15:26.509 --> 15:29.672
and then at the last minute,
you know, it all came together.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.629
-Wow.
-Yeah.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.882
[siren wails]

15:36.018 --> 15:39.807
[radio chatter]

15:39.939 --> 15:43.227
[indistinct announcement over P.A.]

15:46.821 --> 15:47.902
Excuse me.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.023
Did the medication come yet?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.203
Yeah. What? He did what?!

15:58.875 --> 16:00.411
Son of a bitch.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.622
What do you mean Carlton Mackie
didn't deliver the medicine?

16:03.754 --> 16:05.791
He reneged, sir.
He found another buyer.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.415
Pharmacies whose clientele
are willing to pay 2 grand a dose.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.259
So the residents of South Carroll Parish
will not get the medicine they need,

16:11.387 --> 16:13.094
while the residents
in Cameron Parish will.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.213
Yes, sir. It's all about the money;
who has it, who doesn't.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.260
It's like Katrina on steroids,
Mr. President.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.306
Not if I can help it. Tell Kendra I'm
gonna need her in federal court

16:20.438 --> 16:21.928
-as soon as possible.
-Yes, sir.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.681
Yeah, it's the president.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.190
[Kendra] I'm sorry, your honor.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.030
It's your motion, Ms. Daynes.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.196
Yes, for specific enforcement
of a contract.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.239
There's no contract here, judge.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.328
Just a handshake extracted under duress

16:39.457 --> 16:42.950
in the Oval Office
by the leader of the free world.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.587
That's not the contract at issue.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.124
-I'm listening.
-It's a compulsory contract.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.089
The Defense Production Act
requires businesses

16:50.218 --> 16:54.803
essential to the national defense - like
drug manufacturers - to sign agreements

16:54.931 --> 16:56.842
when necessary
for the national defense.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.305
[Rafer] "When necessary."

16:58.434 --> 17:01.802
Mr. Mackie has already made Extasis
available to the population.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.351
To the rich.
And the rich are predominantly white.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.224
Socioeconomic status
is a proxy for race here.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.318
That's not Benevax's concern.

17:10.445 --> 17:11.652
But it's the government's.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.319
South Carroll Parish, a black community,
has 95% of the cases.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.988
The president can decide
how to distribute a drug

17:18.119 --> 17:20.656
during a public health crisis
and at what price.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.953
Why should he be allowed to substitute
his judgment for the private sector's?

17:24.085 --> 17:27.248
Freedom of contract
is a hallmark of our democracy.

17:27.380 --> 17:31.123
But not when the government
is facing down a public-health emergency.

17:31.259 --> 17:36.550
Mr. Mackie, you will relinquish 10,000
doses to the federal government now.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.722
[gavel bangs]

17:40.601 --> 17:41.636
[Charles] Whoa, this is weird.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.851
What do you have, Chuck?

17:44.313 --> 17:47.522
| rendered the top two inches
of that document Lloyd uploaded.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.391
It's a nine-digit number.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.359
-What's it for?
-No idea.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.854
But you can also make out a date.
June 3, 1987.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.196
1987 again.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.315
That's the year of the First Lady's
father's transplant.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.284
Almost to the day.
The transplant was June the 9th.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.245
That document still
could have been a plant.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.536
Maybe, but it's real.
The First Lady confirmed it.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.706
Chuck, where were--

18:08.838 --> 18:11.125
Bethesda-Sinai's records
pre-2000 haven't been digitized.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.669
The hard copies are
in a storage facility in Virginia.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.259
-I'm texting you guys the address.
-Nice.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.879
See if you can render
the rest of that document.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.631
Yeah, that's the plan.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.020
What's up with you guys?

18:25.021 --> 18:27.228
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.562
[computer beeping]

18:28.691 --> 18:30.432
[indistinct conversations]

18:30.568 --> 18:32.684
Hey, I'm hearing
you're a pretty good lawyer.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.106
Thanks. It... It went well.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.195
-Good. And the statue thing?
-Um...

18:36.324 --> 18:37.906
-You're killing it, right?
-Right.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.026
Good. Because we are un-conquerable.
The creme de la creme.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.948
The ne plus ultra.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.787
-Kendra?
-Yes?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.873
-That door.
-Right.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.993
-Thanks.
-[chuckles]

18:51.339 --> 18:52.625
[man] Come on, stop with that!

18:52.757 --> 18:54.043
[indistinct shouting]

18:54.842 --> 18:58.255
The proposal on the table
is a compromise solution.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.799
The statue will be moved
from the courthouse

19:00.931 --> 19:03.218
to the Chickamauga National Forest.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.263
Reverend Dale?

19:07.355 --> 19:11.394
| appreciate your efforts
at conciliation, Ms. Daynes.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.938
But I still remain
fundamentally opposed

19:15.071 --> 19:17.187
to the relocation of that statue.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.813
[people murmuring]

19:18.949 --> 19:21.987
At least we know the price
for the great Tramer Dale selling out.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.070
A trip to the White House.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.121
Young lady...

19:27.917 --> 19:29.499
you mean well.

19:30.294 --> 19:34.629
You declare this is racist
and that is racist.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.921
But you are young, white,
and living in America.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.887
You don't know what it's like
to walk in my shoes.

19:43.641 --> 19:46.429
And I won't always be around to tell you,

19:47.436 --> 19:49.928
but that statue will.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.515
It stays.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.645
[Tom] How's it going down there?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.647
[Tammy] The drugs arrived
late this afternoon.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.821
My team spent the rest of the day
titrating the proper dose.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.660
You think it's gonna work?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.701
| don't know, sir.
We're administering it now.

20:08.833 --> 20:09.868
[sighs]

20:10.000 --> 20:11.786
| don't even have the words.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.667
Sir?

20:13.796 --> 20:16.128
To tell you how grateful I am.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.125
The greatest enemy we face
these days is one we can't even see,

20:20.261 --> 20:22.593
and I send you down there
behind enemy lines.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.962
And you go.

20:24.098 --> 20:27.466
Without hesitation,
no questions asked.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.892
Do you know why I do it?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.146
Why?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.684
Because I know that you would.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.810
-I'll update you in the morning.
-Thanks, Tammy.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.647
Bye.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.874
[vehicle beeping]

20:59.925 --> 21:02.087
| already reconnoitered the place.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.711
Crap security, and no one on site.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.884
You sure you don't want
to go the subpoena route?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.553
Well, they're medical records.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.097
It would take months to get through
the HIPAA regulations.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.846
The enduring charm
of American bureaucracy.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.441
Let's head around back.
| cut a hole in the fence.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.859
Oh, subpoena, huh?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.979
| didn't say / needed one.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.026
[train whistle blowing]

21:26.535 --> 21:28.492
We should find the main office.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.953
There's got to be a computer here
with a directory.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.207
It's alphabetized.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.040
Floors are organized
by month and year.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.087
Is that a light on?

21:41.801 --> 21:42.916
Hannah!

21:44.386 --> 21:45.717
[explosion]

21:50.059 --> 21:52.596
[breathing heavily]

21:58.609 --> 22:01.442
[alarm blaring]

22:06.200 --> 22:09.067
[both grunting, coughing]

22:20.422 --> 22:23.289
Do you guys want to tell me what you're
doing on private property after hours?

22:23.425 --> 22:24.551
No.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.292
Want to start again?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.920
"Cause right now I got you
on B&E and torching the place.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.881
That supposed to impress me,
Agent Wells?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.475
No, it's just to show you that
we're working a federal investigation

22:34.603 --> 22:36.765
and that I don't have to answer
any of your questions.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.274
Well, this isn't federal property.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.685
Well, I am.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.524
So call the White House
and verify my credentials.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.029
I'm still gonna need a statement
from both of you.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.773
We'll send one over.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.735
-You good?
-Yeah.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.498
Hanging around with you
should qualify me for hazard pay.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.288
I've been shot, knocked unconscious.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.128
Not stabbed, though.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.623
-No, not yet.
-[chuckles]

23:06.468 --> 23:07.970
[Seth] As of 8:00 a.m.,

23:08.095 --> 23:10.837
we have a total of 74 fatalities
attributed to the virus.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.681
There are 64 in South Carroll Parish,

23:13.809 --> 23:17.973
8 in Cameron Parish,
and 2 in Wilkinson County, Mississippi.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.346
-[indistinct shouting]
-It spread to Mississippi?

23:20.482 --> 23:23.395
Yes, we have a small cluster
of cases in Mississippi and Texas.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.642
So it's a full-blown epidemic.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.486
No. According to CDC parameters,
this is still a localized outbreak.

23:27.615 --> 23:28.855
That crossed state lines.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.652
That the federal government,
in concert with

23:30.784 --> 23:33.116
local and state authorities,
is aggressively containing.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.406
[indistinct shouting]

23:34.538 --> 23:36.620
-Seth's good.
-Yep.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.535
-The virus is better.
-Yep.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.874
The NAACP wants to know
why eight times as many people

23:41.003 --> 23:43.165
have died in a black parish
than a white parish.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.879
-That's a fair question.
-[scoffs]

23:45.007 --> 23:46.714
I'm saying the president needs
to devote more resources--

23:46.842 --> 23:49.379
Look, we have the CDC, HHS,
NIH, FEMA--

23:49.511 --> 23:52.003
| don't think we can contain this
with acronyms, Emily.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.423
Good morning, doc.
Did you get any sleep?

23:55.559 --> 23:57.095
No, sir. You?

23:57.227 --> 24:00.140
No, not really.
How are we doing?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.387
The Extasis is working, sir.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.059
It dramatically reduces
the viral load

24:03.192 --> 24:05.479
so that the body's immune system
has a fighting chance.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.524
The patients that we've
administered it to are recovering.

24:08.656 --> 24:09.566
Thank God.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.280
The problem is we don't have enough.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.695
-Not anymore.
-Well, we lost a lot of time.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.034
We had to chase
that son of a bitch into court.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.246
Yes, sir, and this virus is moving
much faster than we thought.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.911
We need more medicine.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.330
Unfortunately, Mackie gave us
everything that he had.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.454
-10,000 doses, right?
-That's correct.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.628
- I don't think that's all he had.
-Why?

24:29.760 --> 24:32.047
This medication is
extremely expensive to develop.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.797
10,000 doses is simply not
a cost-effective production,

24:35.933 --> 24:39.267
especially for a company that invests
as much into R&D as Benevax.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.389
Right. We'll look into it. I'll get
back to you as soon as we can.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.397
-Emily, I want--
-On it, sir.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.727
[croaking]

24:52.783 --> 24:55.241
So this is the famous Kirkman toad?

24:55.369 --> 24:58.202
South American tree frog? Yes.

24:58.872 --> 25:02.331
Yeah, it's not a particularly robust
example of the genus.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.918
| don't think you're qualified
to opine about its robustness.

25:06.714 --> 25:07.954
It's spindly.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.501
[screeching]

25:10.926 --> 25:12.087
[screeching continues]

25:12.219 --> 25:13.755
And now it's not spindly.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.549
It's a fight-or-flight response.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.093
Maybe if you stop staring at it...

25:18.225 --> 25:21.138
| don't think it's smart enough
to view me as a threat.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.058
Yeah, brain-to-body mass, frogs are
very low on the evolutionary scale.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.807
They're stupid, even by the modest
standards of amphibians.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.775
Do you need to be here?

25:29.903 --> 25:31.644
Tasty, though. Yeah.

25:31.780 --> 25:35.489
| sampled the related frog,
xenopus levis, on safari in Angola.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.608
And I must tell you...

25:38.287 --> 25:40.369
they go wonderfully with tamarind.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.332
-You're a total disgrace.
-[Seth] Excuse me, Kendra.

25:44.460 --> 25:48.374
The Congressional Black Caucus wants
an update on the statue negotiations.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.007
Update.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.622
Right.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.342
[aquarium sliding]

25:55.304 --> 25:56.590
[frog croaking]

25:56.722 --> 25:59.009
Lyor, can I borrow you
for a minute?

26:01.351 --> 26:03.183
I'm just offering
another perspective.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.179
By accusing us all
of profiting from slavery?

26:06.315 --> 26:07.555
Well, you have.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.852
-Richly.
-How dare you!

26:09.651 --> 26:11.517
You... you and
the Progressive Committee,

26:11.653 --> 26:14.395
you wouldn't be in business without the
historic oppression of African Americans.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.522
-You'd be saving the whales.
-That's slander.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.616
And, Reverend Dale, I've admired you
since reading Hear the Trumpets Blow,

26:19.745 --> 26:22.487
but without slavery, you're preaching
IN a one-room church

26:22.623 --> 26:24.364
and selling raffle tickets
to keep the heat on.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.458
-Let me tell you something, son--
-And the Southern Legacy Foundation?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.543
Well... "Southern Legacy."

26:29.671 --> 26:31.878
Who the hell do you think you are?

26:32.007 --> 26:35.216
A cynical and sad human being.

26:35.844 --> 26:39.462
And I am not prepared
to continue with him in the room.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.464
-Get him out of here!
-That's right.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.308
-Please, just get him out of here!
-[indistinct shouting]

26:45.687 --> 26:47.598
-Thank you, Lyor.
-You're welcome.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.223
Did you and Damian
break into a storage unit?

26:50.359 --> 26:52.441
We were following up on a lead
regarding Patrick Lloyd.

26:52.569 --> 26:53.821
[sighs]
With a burglary.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.062
Aaron, I can't get into the details.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.905
Hannah, you answer to me.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.774
And you answer to the president.

26:59.910 --> 27:03.073
-Your point being...?
-That this is about his family.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.537
And until I know
exactly what I'm dealing with...

27:05.666 --> 27:08.533
-You don't want to expose me.
-Yeah.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.244
Okay.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.254
All right.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.875
I'll trust you on this, Hannah,
and I'll run interference,

27:17.010 --> 27:18.876
but what I can't do
is run interference

27:19.012 --> 27:20.628
for someone who works
for another government.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.055
Surveillance cameras
on the factory across the street

27:24.184 --> 27:26.050
caught him breaking through that fence.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.974
He can answer for that, or he can leave.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.564
All right. I'll tell him.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.692
Reverend Dale,
this is a great honor for me.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.280
The honor is mine, sir.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.320
[Tom] I also wanted to thank you

27:42.452 --> 27:44.944
for your willingness
to compromise on the statue.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.289
In the end, we moved it to an area
that was less trafficked.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.408
| know that's not what you wanted.

27:50.544 --> 27:54.003
No, sir. I believe we sanitize history
at our peril.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.919
It's nice when it's history we don't like.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.213
-But not when it's something we do.
-Yes, sir.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.007
It's a dangerous precedent
we set here today, sir.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.222
| don't disagree with you,
but sometimes,

28:05.350 --> 28:08.308
compromise seems to be
the only way to move forward.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.472
Yeah.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.267
Well, you can thank your pistol
of a young lawyer here

28:12.399 --> 28:14.390
for bringing me around.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.612
She reminded me that
there's no virtue in absolutism.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.153
Old lions like me can be stubborn.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.943
Yet they still roar.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.788
-Mr. President.
-Reverend, please.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.951
Reverend Dale,
may I lead you out, sir?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.792
No. But you may walk with me.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.760
How'd you turn them around?

28:42.888 --> 28:47.678
| unified them by giving them
a common figure to hate.

28:47.809 --> 28:48.844
Huh.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.059
Sadly, I'm starting to realize that

28:51.188 --> 28:54.146
that's one of the great secrets
of good governance.

28:54.816 --> 28:58.605
Sir, Carlton Mackie's in the West Wing.
Want me to bring him in?

28:58.737 --> 29:01.980
No, he doesn't set foot
in the Oval Office ever again.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.194
Excuse me.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.950
[indistinct conversations]

29:08.205 --> 29:09.616
You recognize this?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.160
It's a bill of lading from
the United States Postal Service

29:12.292 --> 29:16.661
for the shipment of 30,000 doses of
Extasis to a warehouse in Jacksonville.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.538
You're in violation of a court order.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.166
No, sir. Court order covered
exactly 10,000 doses.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.587
Because you misled us.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.835
You allowed us to believe
that's all you had.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.179
You failed to acknowledge
the 30,000 doses

29:27.307 --> 29:28.889
that you were holding in reserve.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.883
| provided an amount
| was told was sufficient.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.353
Which very well might have been if
we didn't have to hunt you down to get it.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.097
Lives are at stake here, Mr. Mackie.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.564
| understand that,

29:37.693 --> 29:39.900
which is why I'm making
additional doses available.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.110
So you and your company
can line your pockets.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.196
Respectfully, sir,
it is not that simple.

29:44.324 --> 29:47.737
Extasis is an experimental drug.
Our patent is pending.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.826
But now the drug is in circulation,

29:49.955 --> 29:52.743
meaning every lab in America
will be reverse-engineering it by Monday.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.081
We spent 1 billion
in R&D on this drug.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.793
If that investment is gone,
SO is my company.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.457
That is absolutely ridiculous.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.331
You're gonna peddle some kind of
corporate doomsday scenario

30:02.467 --> 30:04.378
while the country
is really dealing with one?!

30:04.511 --> 30:06.377
Pharmaceutical companies
have made billions

30:06.513 --> 30:10.051
upon billions of dollars profit every
year on the backs of the American people

30:10.183 --> 30:12.390
with the understanding
that if there is ever a crisis -

30:12.519 --> 30:15.227
a real emergency -
you people would finally step up

30:15.355 --> 30:17.813
and do the right thing
and make a sacrifice!

30:17.941 --> 30:19.807
It isn't just my sacrifice.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.731
We have heart-disease drugs
in the pipeline, diabetes drugs.

30:22.863 --> 30:25.150
Whatever happens with this outbreak,
if we go bankrupt,

30:25.282 --> 30:29.071
more people will die from the drugs that
we do not develop than from this bug.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.785
| took an oath
to protect the American people.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.781
My job is to save lives now, today,
and I will not let you get in the way.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.658
| know what you think of me, sir,

30:37.794 --> 30:39.831
but I'm not a racist;
I'm a capitalist.

30:39.963 --> 30:44.252
Yet the fact still remains the community
that is suffering from this right now...

30:46.261 --> 30:48.127
...is made up of minorities.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.597
And I want to help them.
But I don't run a charity.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.557
So pay me what I deserve

30:53.685 --> 30:55.267
or have me arrested
for contempt of court,

30:55.395 --> 30:57.807
but your lawyers
better be ready for a fight.

30:57.939 --> 31:01.432
In the meantime, Mr. President,
| have a business to run.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.110
Just like you.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.865
[door opens, closes]

31:11.912 --> 31:14.995
He's got us, sir. By the time we get
our hands on his supply,

31:15.123 --> 31:16.955
it'll be a drop in the bucket.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.997
Get me Reverend Dale.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.591
See if the old lion
has one roar left in him.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.800
Equal treatment for all people.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.138
A principle for which
so many have fought and died.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.399
But Carlton Mackie
doesn't believe in that.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.185
He believes only the rich

31:42.317 --> 31:45.184
should benefit from the healing powers
of modern medicine.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.358
<i>The rest of us can be left
to sicken and die.</i>

31:48.990 --> 31:51.982
Like the good people
of South Carroll Parish.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.823
-Do you know what you've done?
-Yes.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.368
I've ruined your reputation.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.618
But I'm gonna give you a chance
to get it back.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.877
Today, Carlton Mackie
will be providing

32:04.005 --> 32:07.088
Benevax's entire stockpile
of Extasis to the government.

32:07.217 --> 32:10.801
And a grateful nation is in his debt.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.014
To me, this is not just
responsible corporate citizenship.

32:15.142 --> 32:19.602
This is what it means to be
an American - a great American.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.061
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press,

32:22.190 --> 32:25.433
it is my privilege
to introduce Carlton Mackie.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.685
[applause]

32:28.280 --> 32:31.272
The most powerful man in the world
sucking up to the guy

32:31.408 --> 32:33.570
who lied to his face
and tried to shake him down.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.410
-You know what you call that?
-Leadership.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.120
Damn straight.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.489
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[Carlton] Thank you.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.209
One-way ticket and 12 hours
to leave the country?

32:44.337 --> 32:47.045
Your government's pretty ungrateful.

32:47.174 --> 32:50.758
Yeah, in England,
you'd get a-a ceremony, right?

32:50.886 --> 32:52.968
In England, I'd be knighted.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.508
Well, we don't think much
of burglars here, I guess.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.099
Yeah, well, I don't think much
of not finishing a job.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.059
I'll keep you posted. Don't worry.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.397
Wells.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.391
No, I'm gonna walk you out.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.690
I'm touched.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.108
Don't be.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.402
They wanted me to make sure
you got in the cab.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.068
Charles.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.703
Cheerio, mate.

33:26.671 --> 33:27.957
[Seth] Hey, slow down.

33:28.089 --> 33:31.002
24 hours on the button.
If that thing's still here,

33:31.134 --> 33:33.626
I'm gonna frog-walk it
down Pennsylvania Avenue myself.

33:33.762 --> 33:34.843
That's a little harsh.

33:34.971 --> 33:38.805
Well, you want to write a release
about a swollen, sexually ambiguous toad

33:38.934 --> 33:41.266
named after the president, whose
defining characteristic, by the way,

33:41.394 --> 33:43.726
is that it expectorates
on its insect prey?

33:44.397 --> 33:45.933
Not so much.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.268
-[frog croaking]
-Hey.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.691
Dr. Chen was just filling me in
on our little friend here.

33:53.823 --> 33:54.654
Yes, indeed.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.569
He's incredibly resilient.

33:56.701 --> 34:00.035
Can fight off a wide variety of enemies,
holds his ground.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.995
It's fiercely protective
of its family.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.376
And doesn't even sleep much.
| think he's a perfect namesake.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.117
We thought so too, sir.

34:06.253 --> 34:08.460
Seth, why don't you get
the White House photographer?

34:08.588 --> 34:11.626
Hylidae kirkmanus is ready
for his close-up.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.674
[chuckles] Yes.
While we're young, Seth.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.465
America's waiting.
[chuckles]

34:18.139 --> 34:20.346
[croaking continues]

34:21.141 --> 34:23.179
Just beautiful.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.143
A defense-department
purchase order.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.107
Yeah, for a contractor
called lcarus Astrotech.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.148
First Lady mentioned that her mother
was a government secretary.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.485
-Where did she work?
-D.O.D.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.025
Contract Oversight Services.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.194
Her department would have
handled Icarus bids.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.987
And which Icarus employee signed this?

34:41.371 --> 34:43.829
Contracts officer named Eric Little.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.539
Still works there, actually.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.705
So the First Lady's dad
gets a heart transplant

34:49.713 --> 34:51.203
around the same time
that her mother

34:51.339 --> 34:54.297
is handling the paperwork
for a defense contract.

34:55.302 --> 34:58.010
Why does Patrick Lloyd
want us to know this?

34:58.847 --> 34:59.928
[sighs]

35:01.433 --> 35:02.639
Chuck...?

35:02.767 --> 35:05.680
Look, there's a difference between
correlation and coincidence.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.723
Tell me what you correlated.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.017
[sighs]

35:09.816 --> 35:13.400
| looked into Eric Little. In 1987,
he was on the board of the hospital

35:13.528 --> 35:15.110
where Alex's dad got his transplant.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.855
-A bribe?
-If you're reaching, yeah.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.777
So let's play this out.

35:19.909 --> 35:22.241
The First Lady's mother
gives inside info

35:22.370 --> 35:25.283
to a government contractor
in order to win a bid.

35:25.415 --> 35:28.533
So the First Lady's father
could move up the transplant list?

35:30.170 --> 35:32.457
-It's a pretty circumstantial case.
-[sighs]

35:32.589 --> 35:34.626
Which is why we need
to speak to Eric Little.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.547
Eric Little's address.
Reston, Virginia.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.635
Hey.

35:45.602 --> 35:46.933
You coming?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.642
Tammy, it's Tom.
Can you hear me?

35:54.778 --> 35:56.894
We got the rest
of the medication, sir.

35:57.030 --> 36:00.739
-We're administering it as we speak.
-Is it working?

36:00.867 --> 36:03.484
| think we might have
this bastard on the run.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.452
That is fantastic news.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.706
-Your country owes you a great debt.
-Not just me, sir.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.086
All of us.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.203
The doctors and the nurses
and all the volunteers

36:14.339 --> 36:17.957
who've stayed up for 48 hours
trying to beat this thing.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.292
Tammy, what's wrong?
You don't look well.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.170
-It's not what you think.
-What is it?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.632
-It's kidney failure.
- What?

36:26.768 --> 36:27.803
How?

36:28.895 --> 36:32.980
I had to test out the antiviral on myself
to determine its toxicity,

36:33.108 --> 36:35.566
and I knew the quickest way to do ft.

36:36.111 --> 36:39.979
Turns out the proper dosage
is only one milliliter, not two.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.527
| want you out of there.
I'm bringing you back to Walter Reed.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.696
-You're coming home.
-No, Mr. President.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.489
-I'm not asking.
- I know, sir.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.658
But we're still fighting here.

36:49.249 --> 36:52.708
A good soldier
doesn't leave the field early.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.453
She stays until the last shot is fired.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.292
It's what you would do.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.133
-You told me yourself--
- I have to see this through, sir.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.799
I'll check in with you in the morning.

37:14.357 --> 37:17.691
[Tammy] Two Air Force muscleheads
are telling me I got to get on a plane,

37:17.819 --> 37:21.813
that they're gonna carry me out
if I resist. That's called kidnapping.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.986
Well, you're gonna have to
take that up with a higher authority.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.360
Wait a second,
| am the higher authority.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.204
Come on, Tammy. They were following
orders. They were trying to help.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.367
Yeah, I suppose.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.707
The doc says you're gonna make
a full recovery.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.496
| didn't get the job done.

37:40.258 --> 37:44.377
| am a soldier who left the field
of battle before the battle was won.

37:44.512 --> 37:45.889
Think of it like this.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.881
I'm a general who refuses
to leave anyone behind,

37:49.017 --> 37:50.553
and I outrank you.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.521
Now, I want you
to behave yourself.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.396
Listen to the nurses
and do what they tell you

38:00.528 --> 38:03.941
because if I have to come back,
it is not going to be pretty.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.988
Yes, sir.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.362
She's gonna need
some more Jell-O.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.377
[knock on door]

38:20.173 --> 38:21.413
Looks about right.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.927
| hear you're off
to a pretty good start.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.214
Oh, no, I guess.
Maybe I'm just off.

38:26.346 --> 38:29.259
You negotiated a settlement
for the Emmitt Akin statue.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.301
That no one's really happy with.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.517
You went to court to get medicine
distributed to sick people.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.057
A bunch of whom died

38:36.189 --> 38:39.056
because we didn't
get it there fast enough.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.980
[sighs]
See, firing on all cylinders.

38:42.111 --> 38:45.069
Feels like the whole job around here
is just putting out fires.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.734
Is it always like this?

38:47.408 --> 38:48.569
No.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.738
Usually, the flames are much higher.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.084
[sighs]

38:56.709 --> 38:59.246
[Tom] Did you get a chance
to talk to the reverend?

38:59.379 --> 39:01.916
Yes, sir. And I shook his hand.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.127
It's one of the many things
I'll get to tell my grandchildren.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.298
[chuckles]
He's seen so much.

39:08.429 --> 39:13.344
| can't help but wonder what
he honestly thinks about where we are.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.058
What about you, Mike?

39:15.812 --> 39:17.803
What do you think
about where we are?

39:20.441 --> 39:24.605
Sir, this country's constitution
originally said I was 3/5 of a person.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.404
That's where we started.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.281
But I'm more interested
in where we're headed.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.281
-We need to do better.
-Yeah.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.242
But we've also come a long way.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.787
My great-grandfather
was a sharecropper,

39:39.919 --> 39:41.876
and my dad was an auto mechanic.

39:42.005 --> 39:46.340
And I'm in the Oval Office talking
to the President of the United States.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.753
[chuckles]

39:48.303 --> 39:51.637
You didn't mention your grandfather.
What happened to him?

39:51.764 --> 39:52.845
He was a drunk.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.807
Progress can sometimes
skip a generation.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.347
[scoffs] Yeah.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.187
[sighs]
It's 2017.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.809
We should be talking about
anything and everything but this.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.068
But we're not, sir.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.984
And as long as we're having
the conversation,

40:10.116 --> 40:12.528
you're the person
| want to be having it with.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.913
You've got the boat pointed
in the right direction.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.657
Thank you, Mike.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.332
Well, here's to hoping one day,
we can all learn to row together.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.960
It's all we can do, sir.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.499
Yeah.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.727
All this stuff happened 30 years ago.
How did Lloyd find out about all of it?

40:40.855 --> 40:44.723
He's definitely looking for something
to compromise the president with.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.941
Well, he found a vulnerability.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.402
One that he's making us investigate.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.237
He knows law enforcement can't bury it.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.323
-Yeah, the problem with transparen--
-Shh.

41:04.671 --> 41:05.911
[door creaks]

41:31.572 --> 41:33.028
Eric Little.
