(Tony)
'Who do we got comin' in?'

00:40.040 --> 00:41.809
54's got an unconscious kid.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.644
Uh, sorry, I should have asked
if you wanted a coffee.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.912
No, that's alright,
I had a couple of hundred

00:44.978 --> 00:46.314
cups tonight already.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.282
I feel like I got ants
crawling all over me.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.784
Probably fleas from that
homeless guy with the dogs.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.486
I saw a rat over there
by the dumpsters.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.622
I thought it was
a cat at first.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.090
Call Jerry, he'll have
maintenance bring

00:56.157 --> 00:57.491
out a couple extra traps.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.160
More like a couple
of shotguns.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.528
That thing was the size
of a beaver.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.062
[siren blaring]

01:02.130 --> 01:04.132
- 'Here you go, girls.'
- Alright.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.301
What do you got?

01:07.368 --> 01:09.170
Fifteen year old female
found passed out by a toilet

01:09.237 --> 01:10.771
after playing
a drinking game

01:10.838 --> 01:12.072
at a slumber party.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.542
Unresponsive, sats 93
over two liters

01:14.608 --> 01:15.609
BP's 72 palp.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.678
Couldn't get a line.
Name's Stacey.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.448
Alright, Stacey,
can you hear me? Stacey!

01:20.514 --> 01:22.116
- How long has she been down?
- Not sure.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.585
Bunch of kids that were at the
party are in a car behind us.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.122
- Jerry, what's open?
- Uh, they're both open.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.523
- Take your pick.
- Alright, access.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.060
EtOH level, tox screen,
D-stick, and lytes.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.862
'Non-rebreather,
she's hypoxic.'

01:36.297 --> 01:37.531
Get ready
for a transfer.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.099
One, two, three.

Dr. Morris?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.078
Archie!

01:51.145 --> 01:52.880
Fire's bringing in
an altered old lady.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.148
Found her out in the rain.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.416
(Archie)
'How's the escalator lady?'

01:55.483 --> 01:57.050
Ortho took her up
to screw her hip.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.352
Explosive
diarrhea guy?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.221
The Loperamide must be working,
he's sleeping.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.122
- Belly pain back from CT?
- Nope.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.791
Oh, I hate
working nights.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.293
Really? I like it.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.460
(Archie)
'Nights?'

02:06.527 --> 02:08.196

my grandkids.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.398
[siren blaring]

02:16.637 --> 02:18.539
- What do you got?
- Found her out in the rain.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.275
Looks like
she slipped and fell.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.477
We called for a paramedic unit,
but she passed out.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.346
Figured we were
only a couple blocks away.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.680
It'd be quicker to just
bring her in ourselves.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.283
She's cold, warm saline,
humidified O2.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.451
- And the Bair Hugger.
- Right here.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.052
- 'Jerry?'
- 'Trauma two.'

02:32.119 --> 02:33.854
- 'Open your eyes, ma'am.'
- 'Pulse is weak and thready.'

02:33.921 --> 02:35.689
Looks like she broke
her wrist when she fell.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.725
Maybe hit her head too.
She'll need a CT.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.428
(Archie)
'Make some room!'

02:41.595 --> 02:43.997
Pupils equal
and reactive.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.199
Fourteen liters by mask.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.402
CBC, chem panel,
UA, EKG and chest X-ray.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.904
Core temp is 90 degrees.
Hugger's ready.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.574
What's your name, dear?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.976
Hello?
We got a name, ID?

02:56.043 --> 02:57.478
Nothing but her nightgown.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.879
(Dawn)
Excuse me.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.150
Blood alcohol level
is back, 420.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.652
Alright, no gag,
she needs a tube.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.954
- 'Systolic's only 66.'
- BA of 420.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.457
What is that, like,
a gallon of tequila?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.525
Dr. Gates, a bunch of the girl's
friends are out there.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.193
They wanna come back
and see if she's okay.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.828
Does she look like
she's okay, Jerry?

03:16.264 --> 03:19.233
Give me that. Another 250 to
the IO. Where's my access?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.801
(Chuny)
'The veins blow out every time.'

03:20.868 --> 03:21.702
Mac 3 and 7-0.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.337
Damn it. Lost it
with the flush.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.873
- A pair of gloves and a Cordis.
- The tube won't pass.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.808
- Alright, try cricoid.
- 'Resps are shallow.'

will cross the, uh..'

04:35.309 --> 04:37.478
[beeping]

04:37.545 --> 04:38.579
It's still raining?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.813
I was thinking
about renting a boat

04:39.880 --> 04:41.415
and rowing to work.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.384
- How are the inmates?
- Cranky.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.552
So what's with
the"iCarly"crew

04:44.618 --> 04:45.653
out in the
waiting room?

04:45.719 --> 04:46.920
Uh, they came in
with the kid

04:46.987 --> 04:47.888
with alcohol poisoning.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.457
Gates has been flogging her
for hours.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.492
Okay, kids, looks like
it's just us.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.827
So grab a coffee. We'll work
the board in 15 minutes.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.763
PV in three needs
an H & P, honey.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.031
- Mm, lucky you.
- What's a PV?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.800
Projectile vomiting. Blah!

04:59.867 --> 05:02.470
Guy's like a champ.
Puke went eight feet.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.071
We thought he might
have broken a window.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.539
Isn't this a nurse's job?

05:05.606 --> 05:08.041
Why God created
med students.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.310
Did you finish your
overnight lab paperwork

05:10.378 --> 05:12.580
or leave your usual mess
for me to clean up?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.349
Love you too, Frank.
So long, sucka.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.118
Uh-uh!
Ow! What?

05:18.185 --> 05:21.922
Didn't see you put anything
in the donut jar.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.156
No pay, no eat.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.425
No, I swear, five bucks
last week.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.926
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Morris.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.895
Your old lady standing
in the rain is back from CT.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.729
Night, everybody.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.197
I think I even put
a ten spot

05:30.263 --> 05:31.231
in there the week
before that.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.700
Sure you did.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.935
Next time, write your name
on it just so I know.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.737
- You don't trust me?
- You got it, champ.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.240
Money with your
name on it before

05:40.307 --> 05:41.509
you leave today,
Morr-ass!

05:41.575 --> 05:43.677
I've got a three year old
with otitis media.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.180
Mom poured hot garlic oil
into the kid's ear.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.717
Looks like he has
second-degree burns.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.051
- Man.
- What the hell was that?

05:51.118 --> 05:54.488
PV patient. Thought
he'd be out of ammo by now.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.089
- Otitis kid?
- You know, find Brenner.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.259
I'm off. I gotta finish up
with a few patients first.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.028
CT negative for fracture
or bleed.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.732
Uh-huh. No anemia. EKG's normal.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.502
- And chemistries are okay.
- That's cold.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.071
- She's awake?
- Started coming around in CT.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.006
Oh!

06:13.073 --> 06:14.475
Hello there.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.676
What's your name?

06:15.743 --> 06:18.679
- Beverly.
- What's your last name?

06:18.746 --> 06:21.214
- My name is Beverly.
- Temp's up to 97.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.017
Uh, that means you don't need
this big blanket anymore.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.921
Hey, do you remember what
happened to you, Beverly?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.357
- No.
- You were out in the rain.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.792
And you got cold.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.694
We think you slipped
and broke your wrist.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.263
Oh, my wrist hurts.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.798
Tubular stockinette.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.501
Oh-hoo, hoo-hoo.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.771
Oh, your hands are so warm.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.372
[chuckles]

06:45.439 --> 06:47.575
And soft and strong..

06:48.609 --> 06:51.144
...just like my Bobby's.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.647
(Tony)
'Alright, what do you see?'

06:53.714 --> 06:54.848
(Tracy)
'She must have aspirated'

06:54.915 --> 06:56.383
when she was unconscious
in the bathroom.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.818
And?

06:57.885 --> 07:00.187
That her brain
is oxygen deprived

07:00.253 --> 07:03.290
and she still may be altered
when she sobers up.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.393
Alright, two grams of
ceftriaxone with 500 of Clinda.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.161
Repeat an EtOH, please.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.362
So what do we do now?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.731
Now we wait.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.468
Do you mind
if I take off?

07:14.535 --> 07:15.969
My shift ended, like,
20 minutes ago.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.939
- Yeah, go ahead. Go. Go.
- And I'm beat. Thanks.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.175
Her friends are still out front
asking if they can come back.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.410
Yeah, send 'em in.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.444
(Tracy)
'You think that's a good idea?'

07:24.512 --> 07:25.979
Letting them see
her like this?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.414
Well, they're the ones
that helped her get here.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.282
They should see
the consequences.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.551
So it's okay with you if I go?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.819
Yeah, go.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.821
Get some rest.
Go ahead.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.062
[cellphone beeps]

07:42.129 --> 07:45.699
[telephone ringing]

07:45.766 --> 07:47.635
- Tony?
- 'Hey. Did I wake you?'

07:47.701 --> 07:50.303
No, I'm, uh, just getting
Alex off to school.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.605
Happy birthday.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.140
'I got the day right,
didn't I? '

07:53.206 --> 07:54.441
Yep.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.811
- 'You want me to sing for you?'
- No. God, no.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.212
Mom, let's go.
I don't wanna be late.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.849
- You gonna do anything special?
- 'Like what?'

08:01.915 --> 08:04.585
I don't know.
Uh, get a tattoo.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.319
Go skydiving.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.487
Hang out with your friends.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.689
Come on!

08:08.756 --> 08:10.090
Uh, I gotta go.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.592
Happy birthday.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.826
'Thank you.'

08:22.502 --> 08:23.671
Tony?

08:25.405 --> 08:27.541
[beeping]

08:28.475 --> 08:29.777
[clears throat]

08:29.843 --> 08:32.011
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.514
- Hi, Dick and Heather White.
- You're Stacey's parents?

08:34.582 --> 08:36.917
No, uh, Stacey stayed
at our house last night.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.652
'Her parents were in
Springfield for a wedding.'

08:38.719 --> 08:40.120
(Tony)
'So, you've contacted them?'

08:40.187 --> 08:41.855
(Heather)
'Yes, they're already coming.'

08:41.922 --> 08:43.490
They should be here soon.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.759
Is she gonna be okay?

08:45.826 --> 08:49.029
She's in a coma,
and she may have brain damage.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.565
And we're not gonna know if
she's okay until she wakes up.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.100
Why does she need the tube?

08:53.166 --> 08:56.837
To give her some oxygen
and, uh, protect her lungs.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.306
It keeps her from choking
to death on her own saliva.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.778
Uh, what were
you guys drinking?

09:04.845 --> 09:07.347
Vodka. Vodka
and Kool-Aid.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.482
'We were playing
"I Never."'

09:09.549 --> 09:10.851
Stacey won.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.791
Where'd you get the vodka?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.329
Kids drink.
We all know that.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.832
We just wanted them to be
doing it somewhere safe.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.600
So you supplied the alcohol?

09:26.667 --> 09:27.868
I'd rather they drink at home

09:27.935 --> 09:29.269
than out where
they could be driving.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.940
Can I give her something?

09:44.852 --> 09:47.254
Come on, girls.
Let's go out.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.730
Call the cops.
Get 'em down here.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.334
(Archie)
'Hey, nine month old
with bronchiolitis'

10:01.401 --> 10:03.236
'on continuous nebs,
waiting on the PICU.'

10:03.303 --> 10:06.840
In two, we have testicular pain
after a pommel horse incident.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.208
That sport
should be outlawed.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.877
Twenty eight year old with
leukemia cutis.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.012
Oncology's gonna see him.
Then we have the DKA.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.214
A is gone, but still has the K,
so he needs to come in.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.717
- What is that smell?
- The guy's a geyser.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.185
- Who?
- PV guy.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.820
It's like dodging
artillery in there.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.388
I don't think the wipes
are gonna do it.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.555
Okay, once we're
done here

10:22.622 --> 10:23.590
grab some scrubs
and ditch the clothes.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.092
Don't ditch. Burn.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.828
Guy in 3 torched his fingers
making creme brulee.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.730
Displaced tib-fib
gonna Ortho

10:29.797 --> 10:31.665
and hallucinating
trombone player in sutures

10:31.732 --> 10:33.533
needs a tox screen
and a psych consult.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.335
And with that,
my job here is done.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.104
Okay, Sanchez,
testicular pain

10:37.170 --> 10:39.139
trombone guy and
displaced tib-fib.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.275
Julia, leukemia cutis,
creme brulee and the DKA.

10:42.342 --> 10:46.546
Chaz, Chaz, we have a group
of prospective medical students

10:46.613 --> 10:48.081
coming in here today
for their interviews

10:48.148 --> 10:50.751
and Dr. Anspaugh asked me
to show them around

10:50.818 --> 10:52.352
but as I don't
really want to

10:52.419 --> 10:53.754
and you're the low guy
on this particular

10:53.821 --> 10:55.355
totem pole
you're elected.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.424
- Med students?
- Prospective med students.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.893
Right now they're just
a bunch of overeducated

10:59.960 --> 11:01.294
fiercely ambitious
seniors tryin'

11:01.361 --> 11:02.930
to claw their way over
each other to get into

11:02.996 --> 11:04.064
a prestigious program.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.665
'So show 'em a good time.'

11:07.534 --> 11:09.569
[grunting]

11:09.636 --> 11:11.839
- Okay.
- Morris?

11:11.905 --> 11:13.440
Shh! I'm gonna
put it back.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.543
- Alright.
- 'Hey!'

11:16.609 --> 11:18.678
Here, money's in the jar, Frank.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.513
- 'Morris?'
- I'm out the door.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.648
Beverly's daughter
showed up.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.716
Who?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.684
Old lady with
the broken wrist.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.789
Hello, I'm Dr. Morris.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.858
Temp's 99.
All her labs check out.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.626
God, she scared us
half to death.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.964
Mom, you scared us
half to death.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.631
I went in to make sure
she was getting up

11:38.698 --> 11:40.067
and her bed was empty.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.836
'I looked around the house,
around the yard.'

11:42.903 --> 11:44.972
I ran up and down
the street in the rain.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.507
Tom got the car. He drove
all over the neighborhood.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.276
- Well, the CT is..
- I went over to the church.

11:49.342 --> 11:52.245
To Emma's! I called the police
and about 20 hospitals.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.748
I was out of my mind with worry.
Out of my mind!

11:54.815 --> 11:55.916
She's gonna be fine...

11:55.983 --> 11:57.117
Sometimes she wanders
out of the house

11:57.184 --> 11:58.886
and into the yard,
but she never, ever

11:58.952 --> 11:59.987
leaves the yard, never.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.290
You can't leave
the yard, Mom!

12:03.356 --> 12:04.657
She broke her wrist.
We put a cast..

12:04.724 --> 12:06.226
You're going to give me
a stroke!

12:06.293 --> 12:07.928
You can get that from stress,
can't you, Doctor?

12:07.995 --> 12:10.097
A stroke? Well, yes, stress
can cause a stroke..

12:10.163 --> 12:11.865
What am I supposed
to do about this?

12:11.932 --> 12:14.601
Am I supposed to sew
a LoJack into your nightgown

12:14.667 --> 12:16.136
so I can find you
when you wander off?

12:16.203 --> 12:18.171
Well, we're just glad
she's safe now.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.439
Okay, so you'll have
to bring her back

12:19.506 --> 12:21.008
'in a couple days
for a cast check.'

12:21.074 --> 12:22.375
Well, come back sooner
if there is any pain

12:22.442 --> 12:23.410
redness or swelling.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.778
Take care, Beverly.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.747
- 'Dr. Morris.'
- No, no, no.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.182
Get away from me
or I'll hit you.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.184
- The kid in--
- I mean it, right in the face.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.258
(Archie)
Freedom!

12:38.325 --> 12:40.961
- What was that all about?
- Hell if I know.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.130
The police are here on
your alcohol poisoning girl.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.138
(Dick)
'You're kidding. Wait a minute.'

12:51.204 --> 12:53.073
- You called the cops?
- Damn right, I called the cops.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.641
- Easy.
- This isn't our fault.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.543
- Well, whose fault is it?
- Look, everybody does it.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.710
All the parents.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.246
She had a blood alcohol
level of 420.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.613
That's not like giving a kid
a sip of wine at dinner.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.215
Hey, back up.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.583
You just gonna have me
arrested now, is that it?

13:03.650 --> 13:04.818
Yeah, you're damn right
they're gonna arrest you.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.053
That kid almost died.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.388
She could have permanent
brain damage. 420?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.123
'What the hell were you doing
when those kids'

13:10.190 --> 13:11.658
'were in there trying to drink
themselves to death?'

13:11.724 --> 13:12.960
Watch TV?
Were you in the kitchen?

13:13.026 --> 13:15.128
Mixin' up another batch
of vodka and Kool-Aid?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.429
- No, get off him.
- Come on!

13:16.496 --> 13:19.699
- Daddy!
- Stay down! Ma'am, please!

13:19.766 --> 13:22.502
- 'Stay down! Stay down!'
- I wanna call my lawyer.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.671
- You better have a good one.
- Hey, Doc, you know what?

13:24.737 --> 13:26.039
Shut the hell up.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.943
[beeping]

13:34.514 --> 13:35.849
[thunder rumbling]

13:35.916 --> 13:37.550
Wow, should we be
building an ark?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.653
Well, the news said we could get
as much as five inches today.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.122
I'm glad I'm not
an EMT anymore.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.891
A day like this
you get wet early

13:43.957 --> 13:45.092
you stay wet
the whole shift.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.895
- You'll never get dry.
- There you go.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.262
Thirty seven year old
construction worker.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.331
Took a 15-foot fall
from the scaffolding.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.700
Diffuse abdominal pain,
impaled thigh.

13:53.766 --> 13:54.968
No pulse in
the right foot.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.536
Bagged his femoral artery.
Let's get him in.

13:56.603 --> 14:00.240
BP 90 palp with three liters
of saline over 45 minutes.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.009
(Simon)
'Kind of a long transport time.'

14:02.075 --> 14:04.277
We had to wait for City Fire
to saw him off the rebar.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.046
His name's Dickie,
Dickie DeAngelo.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.647
That looks nasty.

14:07.714 --> 14:08.848
(Frank)
Look at this idiot.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.051
Who drives into that?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.953
What did he think
it was like just a puddle?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.488
Dr. Gates, that alcohol
poisoning

14:15.555 --> 14:17.090
girl's parents are here.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.399
- Hi.
- Hello.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.269
Hey, Doc, you got time
for a kid with a bellyache?

14:29.336 --> 14:31.238
Grandma only
speaks Spanish.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.872
My Spanish is pretty shaky.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.107
I've been taking
a course, but..

14:34.174 --> 14:35.742
It's got to be
better than mine.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.445
All I got is,
Hola, Que paso?

14:38.511 --> 14:39.546
Four year old boy.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.780
Only thing I can think
of is something

14:40.847 --> 14:42.215
to do with
his stomach.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.585
The administrative,
social worker

14:45.652 --> 14:48.321
and counseling offices are
all on the second floor

14:48.388 --> 14:50.790
along with the
wellness classrooms

14:50.857 --> 14:51.824
and the therapy rooms.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.326
[sighs]
Ah.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.495
(Kerry)
Oh, my gosh.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.000
This is..

15:00.067 --> 15:02.602
- This is-this is beautiful.
-Yeah.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.873
36 exam rooms, radiology suite,
two dental suites

15:06.940 --> 15:10.210
shower facilities
for the homeless, OBGYN

15:10.277 --> 15:12.379
optometry, pharmacy,
diagnostics

15:12.445 --> 15:15.515
rapid HIV testing
and support reproductive health.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.918
Wow, I-I can't believe you were
actually able to pull this off.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.253
You had doubts?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.256
No, I-I was pretty sure
you were going to fail.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.658
Tell me, are you gonna
be able to get funding

15:25.725 --> 15:27.594
for the county to staff this?

15:27.660 --> 15:28.895
No, I'm gonna be
fundraising

15:28.962 --> 15:30.163
for the rest of my life.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.898
But we have enough
to open the doors.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.233
Keep us going for
the first year

15:33.300 --> 15:35.268
while I try to build up
some sort of endowment.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.836
Carter, I knew
you were rich.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.838
I didn't know
you were this rich.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.408
Ill-begotten gains
of my Carter forefathers

15:41.474 --> 15:42.542
put to good use.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.977
Redemption?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.245
Maybe so.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.181
Your grandma
would be so proud.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.483
Grandfather's rolling
over in his grave.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.219
He thought the Carter
money was gonna last

15:52.285 --> 15:54.154
longer than
the pyramids.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.488
You spent it all?

15:55.555 --> 15:58.425
No, but most of it.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.461
You've done a great
thing here, John.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.430
A truly great thing.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.302
'Paramedics are pulling in'

16:09.369 --> 16:11.638
with a 47 year old male
with chest pain

16:11.704 --> 16:14.374
and I've got a 60 year old man
short of breath.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.942
Okay, Julia, take
the short of breath.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.278
Chaz, you're with me
for the rule out MI.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.747
He looked like crap
so I brought him right back.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.150
Sats were 72%,
so I went ahead

16:23.216 --> 16:24.484
and hooked him up
with some oxygen.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.153
Okay.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.656
Hello. I'm Dr. Wise.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.924
And you are Mr. Gandhi?

16:31.991 --> 16:35.028
My mom was a Mahatma fan.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.197
And how long
have you been sick?

16:37.264 --> 16:39.699
About 20 years.

16:39.766 --> 16:40.933
More recently?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.603
Trouble breathing?
A couple weeks.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.838
Do you have lung disease?

16:45.905 --> 16:48.275
Not that I know of.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.643
- Heart problems?
- No.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.045
Any fever?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.881
Just...can't breathe.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.116
Okay.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.851
Portable chest,
100% nonrebreather

16:58.918 --> 17:00.587
EKG, first day labs.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.721
IV?

17:01.788 --> 17:02.789
Start a saline lock.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.590
Well, wear gloves.

17:04.656 --> 17:05.925
What?

17:05.992 --> 17:07.660
I have AIDS.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.140
[speaking Spanish]

17:29.982 --> 17:31.184
[sighs]

17:38.258 --> 17:39.859
No, no, no, uh..

17:39.926 --> 17:42.061
[speaking in Spanish]

17:55.842 --> 17:57.377
[sighs]

17:58.445 --> 18:00.313
- Should we intubate?
- Not yet.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.551
Tachypneic, still
hypoxic on 100%?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.453
What do you see?

18:06.519 --> 18:07.887
(Julia)
'Bilateral effusions.'

18:07.954 --> 18:09.389
'Well, that explains
his shortness of breath.'

18:09.456 --> 18:12.159
Mm-hmm, and gives us
something to fix.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.261
Two Thoracentesis trays, please.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.328
You're still gonna
have to tube him

18:15.395 --> 18:16.396
if he has
underlying pneumonia.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.298
One step at a time.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.100
What are you two
talking about?

18:21.168 --> 18:23.403
You have a lot of fluid
outside your lungs.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.104
That's making it hard
for you to breathe.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.207
What can you do for that?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.575
(Simon)
'Well, we can drain the fluid'

18:28.641 --> 18:30.343
which is gonna make
you feel a lot better.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.481
So put your mask back on
and let's lean you forward.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.584
Just dangle your legs.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.818
That's it.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.053
Now we're gonna clean the
skin with a bit of Betadine.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.990
You're gonna feel a sting while
we we numb the skin, Mr. Gandhi.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.057
Gandhi?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.726
Yeah, his mother
was an admirer.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.703
Now you're going
to feel some pressure

18:56.769 --> 18:58.571
while the needle
passes through the ribs.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.142
The fluid looks
a little bloody.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.411
Okay, let's send it
for a cell count

19:04.477 --> 19:07.280
culture and gram stain,
AFB, and cytology.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.881
[coughing]

19:08.948 --> 19:11.784
Uh, you're gonna have some
coughing as your lungs expand

19:11.851 --> 19:13.920
but that's a good thing,
that means it's working.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.290
[coughing]

19:22.429 --> 19:24.564
[thunder rumbling]

19:28.701 --> 19:30.270
No change?

19:30.337 --> 19:31.538
Alright, we're gonna
have to move her.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.172
We need the trauma room
for an MVC.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.807
Come on, guys.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.179
Why don't you go home.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.181
I'll call you
if anything changes.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.592
Hey, Frank, I'm goin' home.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.127
Call me if anything changes
with the Taylor girl, will ya?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.564
- Who?
- Alcohol poisoning.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.066
Oh, another one of those kids
showed up askin' about her.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.369
She's the one with braids
out in the waiting.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.210
Hi. I'm Dr. Gates.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.547
Are you here to see
Stacey Taylor?

20:14.614 --> 20:15.815
- Yeah.
- 'Okay.'

20:15.882 --> 20:17.317
Well, she's in a coma..

20:18.385 --> 20:19.786
...and we don't know
when or if

20:19.852 --> 20:21.788
she's going to regain
consciousness.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.461
Were you at the party
last night?

20:28.528 --> 20:31.364
Um, no.
I heard what happened.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.767
You're here by yourself?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.706
You know, uh, her friends

20:39.772 --> 20:44.477
and, uh, her parents
are on the second floor.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.379
Maybe you wanna
go up there.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.747
You might be
more comfortable.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.719
I should have done something.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.987
Well, you-you weren't
there, right?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.825
Stacey was texting me.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.595
My parents wouldn't let me go.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.497
I was really angry
I wasn't there.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.467
So she was texting me
all night

21:07.534 --> 21:09.969
to tell me
about the party.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.638
She told me
she was sick

21:11.704 --> 21:14.006
really sick
and throwin' up.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.676
And I..

21:18.110 --> 21:19.546
...thought it was funny.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.886
I should have called somebody.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.623
I could have..

21:34.293 --> 21:35.928
Maybe I could have.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.031
[sobbing]

21:51.010 --> 21:52.845
The ER is the nerve center
where it all begins.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.514
Between the ER
and Urgent Care

21:54.581 --> 21:57.249
we see over 200,000
patients a year.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.620
As med students, this is gonna
be your first rotation.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.622
Four years to see
if you've got what it takes

22:02.689 --> 22:04.824
to be on the front line
of urban medicine

22:04.891 --> 22:06.659
or if you're a little
bit more suited

22:06.726 --> 22:11.398
for dermatology or plastics,
something a little bit more..

22:11.464 --> 22:12.765
...a little bit more safe

22:12.832 --> 22:14.734
that you can practice
out in the suburbs.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.904
Triage is
our first stop.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.972
We rely on our
talented nursing staff

22:20.039 --> 22:21.508
to determine who's
gonna be first

22:21.574 --> 22:23.142
and who is gonna
have to wait.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.244
And wait and wait.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.613
These highly trained
professionals

22:26.679 --> 22:28.114
can tell the difference
between a hot MI

22:28.180 --> 22:31.150
and a common indigestion
just by lookin' at a guy.

22:31.217 --> 22:34.120
After triage,
the patient is brought back.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.588
Their chart is racked.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.690
You pick up the next in line
no matter what.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.527
You get caught swapping, fecal
incontinence for knee pain,

22:40.593 --> 22:42.194
you'll never hear
the end of it.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.496
Glad you learned your lesson.

22:43.563 --> 22:44.864
Our curtain areas

22:44.931 --> 22:46.933
'are for our
subacute patients.'

22:46.999 --> 22:50.269
Over there is the break room
where we got bad coffee

22:50.336 --> 22:51.738
and stale bagels.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.205
'Trust me, you don't wanna
be going over there.'

22:53.272 --> 22:56.576
Uh, excuse me. Keep up, okay?

22:56.643 --> 22:58.578
'So here's the deal about
being a med student.'

22:58.645 --> 23:01.448
Some docs like to teach
but most just see us

23:01.514 --> 23:03.082
as being a pain
in the ass.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.619
So they're not gonna be
issuing no formal invitation

23:06.686 --> 23:08.555
to the cool stuff.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.322
You got to keep
your eye open

23:10.389 --> 23:11.458
and go after the action.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.892
It's not gonna
come to you.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.427
Come on.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.362
Another epi
and let's shock him.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.998
Shock him again.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.567
- Chaz.
- This is Dr. Brenner.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.569
One of our fine
ER attendings.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.236
Dr. Brenner, this is a
tour of prospective

23:24.303 --> 23:25.605
medical students
that you asked..

23:25.672 --> 23:28.274
Chaz, get them
the hell out of here!

23:28.340 --> 23:29.509
Okay.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.679
So who wants to see
the suture room?

23:33.345 --> 23:34.514
Clear!

23:39.552 --> 23:40.987
Anybody seen Brenner?

23:41.053 --> 23:43.255
Down in Trauma
with a chest pain.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.524
You okay?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.192
Just got results back
on a patient.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.560
Bad news?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.129
You want company?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.531
No, I should do it.

23:52.465 --> 23:53.966
No time like
the present.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.469
Right.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.872
Post tap film
came back.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.908
Your lungs have
re-expanded.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.210
No pneumonia.
Are you feeling better?

24:04.276 --> 24:06.278
I can breathe again.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.380
You said you've been sick
for a number of years.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.450
Well, I got the AIDS diagnosis
in 1987.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.285
Started AZT soon
as it was out.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.988
It's great that you've been able
to fight it off this long.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.995
'Come on, doctor,
no holding back.'

24:23.630 --> 24:24.931
I can take it.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.700
Believe me.

24:30.503 --> 24:31.904
Your test results came back.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.475
There were atypical lymphocytes.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.410
Large immunoblastic cells.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.846
And what does that mean?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.517
It means that you have cancer.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.620
[thunder rumbling]

24:54.794 --> 24:56.428
Whoa, it's a little nasty
out there today.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.265
Keeps up, we're gonna start
handing out life jackets.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.399
How are you?

25:00.466 --> 25:01.734
I'm on the mend.

25:01.801 --> 25:02.969
Everything workin'
down there?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.537
No complaints
with the plumbing.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.838
Wish I could say the same.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.640
I was up six, seven times
last night.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.842
[sighs]
Kind of a quiet day today, huh?

25:09.909 --> 25:11.611
Yeah, I'm thinkin' of
pulling out a crossword puzzle

25:11.678 --> 25:13.145
just to fill the time.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.314
I just had lunch with
Susan Lewis and Kerry Weaver.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.549
Really?

25:16.616 --> 25:18.217
How is the old dragon lady?

25:18.284 --> 25:19.552
She's good.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.554
Susan actually looks fantastic.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.955
What are they
doin' in town?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.256
Tonight's the opening
of the Carter Center.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.125
They...came in for it.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.227
Open bar, free food
on fancy little crackers.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.528
All that.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.097
Housekeeping needs
to clean up trauma two.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.432
It's still a mess after
that shotgun accident kid.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.466
They're down
in Radiology

25:34.533 --> 25:35.735
tryin' to mop up a roof leak.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.337
- What's up?
- Pregnant woman coming in, MVA.

25:38.404 --> 25:39.739
Here they are.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.879
Hey, store that for me,
would you?

25:46.946 --> 25:47.847
Sure.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.049
[instrumental music]

25:52.819 --> 25:53.986
(female #1)
'Thirty six year old female'

25:54.053 --> 25:55.221
'nine months pregnant
with twins.'

25:55.287 --> 25:56.488
'Broke her water at home.'

25:56.555 --> 25:57.790
Oh, contraction!

25:57.857 --> 25:59.258
Traffic collision on
the way to the hospital.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.526
T-boned by a CTA bus.

26:00.593 --> 26:01.761
(Simon)
'This is your first pregnancy?'

26:01.828 --> 26:03.129
- Fourth!
- Struck on the passenger side.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.530
With abdominal pain
and contusions.

26:04.597 --> 26:05.665
Tachy to 120,
BP's normal.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.099
(Lisa)
'Get me off of this!'

26:07.166 --> 26:09.235
As soon as we assess you, ma'am.
Let's get her inside!

26:09.301 --> 26:11.804
[screaming]
Go.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.341
[groaning]

26:17.877 --> 26:19.946
On my count.
One, two, three.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.114
My husband should
be here any minute.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.450
He was on his way
to meet me at Mount Sinai.

26:24.516 --> 26:25.517
Alright, check the perineum.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.686
I'll do a primary survey.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.120
[groaning]

26:28.187 --> 26:30.222
- 'I got to push!'
- It's okay. Not yet.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.891
- 'Not yet, not yet!'
- 'I got to!'

26:31.958 --> 26:33.525
Sterile gloves
and an OB kit.

26:33.592 --> 26:37.664
- What do we need, Julia?
- CBC, coags, type, Rh.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.198
And?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.332
- Um..
- Fetal monitor.

26:40.399 --> 26:41.500
Uh, right.
Fetal monitor.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.202
You, uh, care to pitch in,
Dr. Carter?

26:43.269 --> 26:44.671
- Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
- I'll start a second line.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.739
[screaming]

26:46.806 --> 26:48.107
Now, don't move your
neck until

26:48.174 --> 26:49.608
we make sure that
it's not broken.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.477
I'm fine!

26:51.543 --> 26:53.279
I guess the C-spine
is clear.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.681
She's crowning.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.315
All right, mom,
you can push now.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.651
[screaming]

26:58.718 --> 27:00.019
Head is out.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.824
Okay, get ready.
Twins go quick.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.726
Delivering the shoulders.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.729
[screaming]

27:09.796 --> 27:12.398
[baby crying]

27:12.464 --> 27:13.933
Good...girl.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.137
- Umbilical clamp.
- Is she okay?

27:18.204 --> 27:20.072
She's got a great
set of lungs.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.244
Uh, baby looks great.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.680
Apgar of 9,
one off for color.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.882
[baby crying]

27:33.886 --> 27:36.789
Congratulations, mom.
One down, one to go.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.825
[baby continues crying]

27:46.065 --> 27:48.434
Hey, baby.
Want to go see mom?

27:53.973 --> 27:56.008
Hi. You're beautiful.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.351
Hey.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.723
We paged OB down
for the twins.

28:10.790 --> 28:11.991
Has anybody seen them?

28:12.058 --> 28:13.860
Coburn's in an
emergency C section

28:13.926 --> 28:15.061
said she'd send
down a resident

28:15.127 --> 28:16.428
as soon as she
could free one up.

28:16.495 --> 28:17.764
The husband
just showed.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.331
He's the wet,
anxious guy.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.938
- Mr. Salamunovich?
- Yeah Chris. Is Lisa okay?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.339
The first baby's
out and healthy

28:27.406 --> 28:28.574
and we're waiting
on the second.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.976
Oh, God.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.750
Can I help you?

28:37.817 --> 28:39.718
You don't remember me.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.854
Should I?

28:41.921 --> 28:44.456
God, it's amazing how little
has changed around here.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.361
- My dad used to be on staff.
- Mm-hmm.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.031
Mark Greene.
I'm his daughter, Rachel.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.403
[instrumental music]

28:59.171 --> 29:00.973
[groans]

29:01.040 --> 29:04.576
We have three boys
under the age of ten at home.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.312
- Three?
- 'Yep.'

29:06.378 --> 29:08.981
It's a madhouse.

29:09.048 --> 29:13.452
But I wanted a girl,
so before Chris went in

29:13.519 --> 29:17.356
to get snipped, we decided
to try one more time.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.859
- We ended up with twins.
- Hey.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.293
What are the chances
of that, huh?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.095
Hello, Camille. Hey.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.964
We're still going with Camille
for the first one, right?

29:25.031 --> 29:26.698
Yeah, fine by me.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.634
It was my grandmother's name.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.069
Honey, keep an eye
on the clock.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.737
Preschool pickup's in an hour.

29:31.804 --> 29:32.939
I'll just have my mom
go get them.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.240
No, no, no. You should..

29:34.306 --> 29:36.976
[groaning]

29:37.043 --> 29:39.711
- 'Another contraction.'
- Okay.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.113
Big push this time.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.781
[groans]

29:43.415 --> 29:45.384
Okay. Big push.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.086
[screaming]

29:47.153 --> 29:49.521
- Fetal heart rate's down.
- Wh-what does that mean?

29:49.588 --> 29:50.923
Could be a sign of distress.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.558
Okay, mom, let's get
this baby out, huh?

29:54.260 --> 29:56.362
[screaming]

29:56.428 --> 29:57.529
I can see the head.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.999
Meconium.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.001
- DeLee suction now, please.
- What's meconium?

30:02.068 --> 30:04.136
It's in the baby's intestine
prior to birth.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.905
It could pass it
into the amniotic fluid

30:05.972 --> 30:07.373
and get into their
lungs during birth.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.507
[screaming]

30:11.643 --> 30:12.644
How-how bad is that?

30:12.711 --> 30:14.613
(Simon)
'Clamp.'

30:14.680 --> 30:16.615
And cut.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.150
(John)
'If it gets into
the baby's lungs'

30:18.217 --> 30:19.718
then she has to be intubated.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.387
It has to be sucked out.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.357
[sighs]

30:29.128 --> 30:31.230
It's another girl, honey.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.865
[chuckles]

30:36.502 --> 30:37.769
She's not crying.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.072
That's intentional. We don't
want her to breathe in the mec.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.508
Laryngoscope
and suction, please.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.077
- Mom's heart rate's up to 140.
- Some bleeding here.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.612
Okay, two liters of saline,
wide open.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.547
- A lot of bleeding.
- Let's get some more access.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.849
Alright, I want you to put
gentle traction on the cord.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.119
Let's get two units
from the blood bank.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.820
(Simon)
'Meconium at
the epiglottis.'

30:54.887 --> 30:56.455
(Haleh)
'She's cyanotic. Poor tone.'

30:56.522 --> 30:58.590
Honey, is she okay?

30:58.657 --> 30:59.825
Systolic's down to 90.

30:59.892 --> 31:00.859
Alright, prime
the rapid infuser.

31:00.927 --> 31:01.894
Where the hell is OB?

31:01.961 --> 31:03.529
[screaming]

31:10.669 --> 31:12.972
Is that the placenta?

31:13.039 --> 31:15.174
That looks like
uterine inversion.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.475
- 'Set up for a Cordis.'
- What?

31:16.542 --> 31:17.776
Give me some steriles.

31:17.843 --> 31:19.979
The uterus has
turned itself inside out

31:20.046 --> 31:21.347
and has pushed itself
through the cervix.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.982
I need you to push it back in.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.584
[screaming]

31:27.519 --> 31:29.956
- It won't go!
- Alright, IV nitro, right now!

31:30.022 --> 31:32.391
[screaming]

31:32.458 --> 31:35.261
Let's set up for an intubation
on mom. Two units of FFP.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.629
Let's have the blood bank
stay ahead four units.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.369
[beeping]

31:45.771 --> 31:47.906
[engine revving]

31:51.110 --> 31:53.245
[beeping]

31:58.917 --> 32:01.053
[indistinct chatter]

32:11.597 --> 32:13.532
[sighs]

32:15.934 --> 32:18.637
Pressure's only 65/45.
Second unit's in.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.006
Hang two more.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.607
No, it won't go.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.142
- Alright, four units of mag.
- What's happening?

32:23.209 --> 32:24.543
If we can't get your
wife's uterus in

32:24.610 --> 32:26.112
we're gonna have to
take her up to the OR

32:26.178 --> 32:27.146
for general anesthesia
and see if we can

32:27.213 --> 32:28.380
relax the uterus
up there.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.848
(Haleh)
'Heart rate's up to 140.'

32:29.915 --> 32:30.949
'Alright, you try
one more time.'

32:31.017 --> 32:32.318
Really push hard.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.355
Really push.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.057
Come on. Get in there!
Really push!

32:45.697 --> 32:46.698
- It's in!
- It's in?

32:46.765 --> 32:47.799
- 'Yeah.'
- Oh, great.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.001
Hold off on the nitro.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.302
20 of pit in a liter,
wide open.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.737
Keep pressure on the cervix
with your fingers.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.939
No, no, push in, all the way
up to your forearm.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.141
With your other hand,
I want you to massage

32:55.207 --> 32:57.009
the uterus
at the umbilicus.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.410
OB's here.
Heard you have twins.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.579
Yeah, we just reduced
an inverted uterus.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.681
She's still bleeding with an
accreta. Alright, call the OR.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.150
Tell Coburn I'm bringing her up.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.484
- What are you going to do?
- You're the dad?

33:05.551 --> 33:06.552
Yes.

33:06.618 --> 33:07.953
We need to stop
the bleeding or else

33:08.020 --> 33:09.355
we may have to give her
a hysterectomy.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.090
- How about the twins?
- First one's good.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.424
Second one aspirated some mec.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.060
- I paged Pedes.
- Should I let go?

33:14.126 --> 33:15.461
Do not let go until
they tell you to in the OR.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.163
Should I go
with Lisa or stay?

33:17.229 --> 33:18.797
Your wife's gonna be under
general anesthesia for a while

33:18.864 --> 33:21.233
but we'll give you updates
from the operating room.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.871
(John)
'Your wife
mentioned something'

33:25.937 --> 33:27.873
about having to pick up
kids at school.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.108
If you need to
make a call

33:29.175 --> 33:31.177
you can use that phone
on the wall there.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.688
[indistinct chatter]

33:47.659 --> 33:48.627
Sarah!

33:49.628 --> 33:51.797
'Sarah!'

33:51.863 --> 33:53.432
'Hey!'

33:56.102 --> 33:58.104
What's goin' on? Thought you
couldn't pick me up today.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.705
I couldn't sleep. Get in.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.873
But I was gonna go to Madison's
to study for the trig test.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.743
I'll give you a ride. I have
to meet Alex to finish the car.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.186
So what's up, Tony?

34:14.253 --> 34:15.887
You ever play "I Never?"

34:15.954 --> 34:17.289
Drinking game.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.658
I haven't been drinking, okay?

34:19.725 --> 34:20.826
"I Never?"

34:21.760 --> 34:23.129
I've heard of it.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.030
I mean, some kids from school
have played it

34:25.097 --> 34:26.732
at parties and stuff.

34:26.797 --> 34:27.998
How many drinks
do you think it would take

34:28.065 --> 34:29.534
to be drunk enough to die?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.303
- What?
- How many.. What do you weigh?

34:31.370 --> 34:32.603
How much, 90 pounds?

34:32.670 --> 34:34.540
How many drinks
would you have to down

34:34.606 --> 34:36.108
before the alcohol
would kill you?

34:36.175 --> 34:37.509
What do you think?

34:37.576 --> 34:40.146
- I don't know.
- Five? 10? 20? 50?

34:40.212 --> 34:42.114
- I don't know, 20?
- Try six.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.216
- Six?
- Yeah.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.817
That could do it.
That could-that could kill you.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.654
Give me your phone.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.987
Give me your..
I'll give it back to you.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.357
That's fine. Give it.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.527
Do me a favor.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.929
Next time you're at a party
and you're drinking

34:57.996 --> 34:59.765
and you've had too much to drink
or you're throwing up

34:59.831 --> 35:02.234
or your friends are
or somebody's texting you

35:02.301 --> 35:03.602
saying they're throwing up..

35:06.905 --> 35:08.807
...hit that.

35:08.874 --> 35:09.841
"Help?"

35:11.243 --> 35:13.078
- 'Who does it call?'
- Me.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.247
And I'll come,
no questions asked.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.483
I'll help you.
I'll help your friends.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.785
I'll make sure you're okay.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.187
No questions asked.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.124
[train chugging]

35:26.192 --> 35:27.559
(John)
'When did it stop raining?'

35:27.626 --> 35:29.495
How's that second
twin doing?

35:29.561 --> 35:31.163
Intubated,
waiting for Pedes.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.464
- Your mom get to the OR okay?
- Yeah.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.999
I'm going across
the street for coffee.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.835
- Anybody want a latte?
- Sure. Nonfat, double shot.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.404
- Nonfat, double shot.
- Mocha frap, extra foam.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.439
- Mocha frap.
- 'Excuse me.'

35:40.506 --> 35:42.308
I'm not sure I'm
in the right place.

35:42.374 --> 35:45.644
My daughter-in-law's
here somewhere, having twins.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.514
Is her name Lisa?
Come with me.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.516
Go right in here and just check
in with that nurse at the desk.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.083
- Thank you.
- Julia, there's a call for you.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.385
- Oncology.
- Thanks.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.953
Hey, you guys know a doctor

35:55.020 --> 35:56.588
used to work here named Greene?

35:56.655 --> 35:58.324
'His daughter was
on my tour today.'

35:58.390 --> 35:59.891
- She's applying to med school.
- Rachel?

35:59.958 --> 36:02.228
- Yeah, I think so.
- 'You're kidding me.'

36:02.294 --> 36:03.629
Is she still around?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.264
I dropped the tour off
at the dean's office.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.832
They're doin' their
interviews this afternoon.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.834
[indistinct chatter]

36:18.944 --> 36:19.911
Rachel?

36:22.214 --> 36:23.982
[chuckles]
Dr. Carter!

36:24.049 --> 36:26.318
Hey...look at you.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.687
You're all grown up.
How old are you?

36:28.754 --> 36:30.489
- Twenty two.
- Oh, my God.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.724
I remember you
when you were..

36:32.791 --> 36:34.293
Now you're going to
medical school, huh?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.527
Took your MCATs and everything?

36:35.594 --> 36:36.662
Yeah.

36:36.728 --> 36:37.896
Where are you doing
your undergraduate?

36:37.963 --> 36:39.231
- Duke.
- Great.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.532
Yeah, Elizabeth's
on faculty there

36:40.599 --> 36:42.268
so I get a really
good deal on tuition.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.635
- Elizabeth Corday?
- Yeah.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.304
Yeah, actually,
she flew up with me.

36:45.371 --> 36:46.905
- Elizabeth is in Chicago?
- Uh-huh.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.640
Oh, what are you both
doing later tonight?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.676
Uh, I don't know, I think
we're seeing some old friends.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.111
No, no, no, no,
you have to come

36:53.178 --> 36:54.246
to this thing
that we're doing.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.947
Rachel Greene!

36:56.014 --> 36:57.583
This is my number.
Give this to Elizabeth.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.884
- Have her call me.
- Yeah.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.286
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.554
- 'Good luck in there.'
- Thanks.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.960
Thanks. Yeah.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.862
Path says it's primary
effusion lymphoma.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.230
Who's this?

37:12.298 --> 37:14.933
- My guy who couldn't breathe.
- What's his prognosis?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.636
- Median survival's two months.
- And his options?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.004
Well, chemo and radiation
could give him another

37:19.070 --> 37:20.672
couple of months.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.275
- You told him he has cancer?
- Yeah, a couple of hours ago.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.644
- Brave.
- Or maybe just relieved.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.146
- Relieved?
- Dr. Brenner?

37:28.213 --> 37:30.816
To finally know how and when
after all these years.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.622
[hissing]

37:38.857 --> 37:41.927
Nice and slow.
Keep it clean.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.462
Excellent.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.830
Good.
That'll do it.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.467
Yeah, man, that looks good.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.669
I think you were right
about the color.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.505
I don't know. The cobalt blue
would've been cool too.

37:53.572 --> 37:56.575
No. Red is more your mother.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.444
Phew. Yeah, all fire.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.145
Well, that's better
than cold and distant.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.314
- If you say so.
- I know so.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.850
She's gonna love this.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.884
Definitely.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.755
Sorry I've been gone so long.
Something came up.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.623
Oh, that's okay.
Gerry came by.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.792
Gerry Gugliemotto, Dr. Wise.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.060
She's very nice.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.762
- Great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.530
Gerry brought
me gardenias.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.265
I just love gardenias,
don't you?

38:20.332 --> 38:21.833
'I mean, the smell..'

38:21.900 --> 38:24.336
Uh, the rest of your labs
came back.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.604
Everything looks clear.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.105
Except for the cancer.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.941
But it means your body
could tolerate chemotherapy.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.543
No. No, thanks.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.579
It could buy you
a few more months.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.847
I've already had
an extra 20 years, doc.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.350
I should have died with
all my friends in the '80s.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.751
You're still here.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.354
Tommy and Bill.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.289
Jeff and David.

38:44.356 --> 38:45.991
Remember Michael?
Michael Thomas?

38:46.057 --> 38:47.258
Of course I do.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.361
Little Bobby?

38:50.629 --> 38:52.464
So many people I loved.

38:54.065 --> 38:57.703
I've been trying
to live for them, you know?

38:57.769 --> 38:59.705
Keep their memories alive.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.709
But I've had my time.
No regrets.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.751
I went skydiving
last year in Hawaii.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.986
It was the most
remarkable thing.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.489
I was floating...free.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.526
I-I couldn't feel my body.

39:22.728 --> 39:26.331
I'm afraid of heights,
but-but-but I wasn't up there.

39:26.398 --> 39:30.402
'I guess that's kind of what
I hope death is like, doc.'

39:30.469 --> 39:33.038
'Floating, free in the air..'

39:34.506 --> 39:36.742
'...above everything.'

39:36.808 --> 39:40.512
Just...just watching
the world drift by.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.183
Is there anything
I can do for you?

39:45.250 --> 39:46.918
Yeah, th-there is.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.389
I don't want it to hurt.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.463
We can help with that.

40:06.772 --> 40:07.873
Sixty six year woman
ruling in for MI.

40:07.939 --> 40:09.775
She's going to the
cath lab any second.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.877
Hula girl needs an X-ray
of her wrist.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.013
We've got an SBO who's NPO
and not happy about it.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.448
Sickler with a fever.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.651
Dislodged G-tube on an old gal
that came in from Lakeshore

40:19.718 --> 40:22.588
and a three week old
with lethargy and cardiomegaly

40:22.654 --> 40:23.889
admitted for echo.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.323
And, as you can see,
the hallucinating

40:25.390 --> 40:26.625
trombone guy's still here.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.660
The tox was negative,
but we're trying to find

40:28.727 --> 40:30.529
a psych bed
somewhere in Chicago.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.330
Is my alcohol poisoning
girl still here?

40:32.397 --> 40:33.899
The family didn't want
her admitted here

40:33.965 --> 40:35.266
so they're transferring
her to Mercy

40:35.333 --> 40:36.401
but Mercy hasn't
picked her up yet.

40:36.468 --> 40:37.636
Alright.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.707
(Frank)
'Hey, Jerry, look
at this inbox.'

40:41.773 --> 40:43.141
'It'sempty.'

40:43.208 --> 40:47.245
All of my day shift
paperwork is completed.

40:47.312 --> 40:51.282
Look. It's a think of beauty.
It's a clericalMona Lisa.

40:51.349 --> 40:54.620
I just wanted you to see
what a empty inbox looks like

40:54.686 --> 40:57.388
so you can try,
try to replicate that

40:57.455 --> 40:59.791
for when I come in
tomorrow. Okay?

41:01.426 --> 41:02.794
Tough day?

41:02.861 --> 41:04.863
About the same
as every other.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.865
- Goodnight, y'all.
- Night.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.200
Watch out for the guy in three,
he's a grabber.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.636
Thanks.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.038
Hi.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.541
You look nice.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.976
Oh, I got a thing to go to.

41:18.043 --> 41:21.613
You saw a med school applicant
today Rachel Greene.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.782
- She's pretty great.
- She a student of yours?

41:23.849 --> 41:25.551
No, she's Mark Greene's
daughter.

41:25.617 --> 41:28.319
Mm-hmm, so you have
no firsthand knowledge

41:28.386 --> 41:29.955
of her academic qualifications?

41:30.021 --> 41:32.357
No, I've known her
since she was kid

41:32.423 --> 41:34.292
and Mark was
a pretty great doctor.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.962
I'm sure the apple didn't fall
too far from the tree.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.698
[sighs]

41:41.533 --> 41:42.834
She did well
on the interview.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.536
I can't say if she'll
make our final list

41:44.603 --> 41:46.137
but she made
the first cut.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.773
(Simon)
'So, he's a bit of a boozer?'

41:47.839 --> 41:49.074
(Neela on speaker)
'Stinks of bourbon by noon.'

41:49.140 --> 41:50.776
(Simon)
'It doesn't affect his work?'

41:50.842 --> 41:53.244
'No, that's the irritating
thing, drunk as a skunk'

41:53.311 --> 41:55.113
'and he's still
a wonderful surgeon.'

41:55.180 --> 41:56.247
- Is that Neela?
- Yeah.

41:56.314 --> 41:57.382
- Hey!
- Hey.

41:57.448 --> 41:58.550
How's the
teaching going?

41:58.617 --> 42:00.786
Oh, I've got mostly R3s.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.188
Very polite, follow me
around like ducklings.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.422
I'm sure they're in awe

42:04.489 --> 42:05.991
of the depth of your
surgical brilliance.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.893
It's either that or
your exceptional beauty.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.061
Ah, I think they may
just be stupid.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.296
(Archie)
Hey, is that Neela?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.564
- Yeah.
- Hey!

42:12.631 --> 42:14.332
- Hey!
- 'How's life on the bayou?'

42:14.399 --> 42:17.736
[chuckles]
The bayou's, like,
a hundred miles away, Morris.

42:17.803 --> 42:19.304
Dr. Brenner,
Pedes finally showed up

42:19.370 --> 42:20.572
to extubate
the mec twin.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.907
Okay, thanks.
Uh, I've got to go.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.175
- I'll, uh, speak to you later.
- Oh, okay.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.343
How's the mom?

42:25.410 --> 42:26.678
Still in surgery,
I think.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.079
She's still in the OR?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.615
As far as I know, yeah.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.316
Hey, you mind
if I tag along with you?

42:33.484 --> 42:35.921
- 'See you, Neela.'
- Okay, bye.

42:38.323 --> 42:39.791
Hey, Joe.
How we doin'?

42:39.858 --> 42:41.526
Suctioned out
the trachea and the stomach.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.561
No mec below the cords.

42:43.629 --> 42:44.963
Satting at 100%.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.398
Vigorous tone,
good respiratory effort.

42:47.465 --> 42:48.634
Think we can extubate.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.101
Blow by oxygen
is ready.

42:50.168 --> 42:51.169
Here we go.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.173
[instrumental music]

43:07.753 --> 43:08.954
Good air movement.

43:12.858 --> 43:16.261
- Can I hold her?
- By all means.

43:16.327 --> 43:19.297
How about you go and grab
the rest of the kids?

43:19.364 --> 43:21.532
Oh. I gotta go.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.868
Good work, Doctors.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.570
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.

43:25.637 --> 43:27.773
[baby crying]

43:30.842 --> 43:32.678
What's the mom still
doing up in the OR?

43:32.744 --> 43:34.445
She's probably
already out.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.682
Sometimes they
forget to call.

43:39.918 --> 43:42.520
Hey, guys, do you wanna
meet your sisters?

43:42.587 --> 43:44.756
- Yeah.
- Yes.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.092
- Come on.
- Oh, boy.

43:49.027 --> 43:51.596
Hey.

43:51.663 --> 43:53.264
Kiddo, look at this.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.701
Look.
I love you.

43:55.767 --> 43:57.068
'Look at this.'

44:00.571 --> 44:01.873
They're sisters.

44:03.174 --> 44:04.542
Where is my mom?

44:04.609 --> 44:06.745
[instrumental music]

44:10.081 --> 44:12.050
'Eighty two year old woman
with history of MS'

44:12.117 --> 44:14.052
and pyelonephritis
on home IV therapy.

44:14.119 --> 44:17.655
Now with altered mental status
and respiratory distress.

44:17.723 --> 44:18.990
BP's 60 palp.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.626
'Gave 500cc's of saline
to get her pressure up'

44:21.693 --> 44:22.994
'but it's all
going to her lungs.'

44:23.061 --> 44:25.230
She's been coughing
and groaning terrible.

44:25.296 --> 44:26.765
- She's burning up.
- Pulmonary edema.

44:26.832 --> 44:28.166
Probably septic.

44:28.233 --> 44:29.667
(Paul)
'This is the second time
we've been here.'

44:29.735 --> 44:32.103
We've been taken care
of by Dr. Gates.

44:49.988 --> 44:51.389
Her parents around?

44:51.456 --> 44:52.657
They've been here all day.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.459
They must be around
here somewhere.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.827
Hey, Tony?

44:55.894 --> 44:58.029
Elderly MS lady
just came in with sepsis.

44:58.096 --> 44:59.330
Husband said you've
been treating her.

45:10.341 --> 45:12.343
- You look tired.
- Thanks.

45:12.410 --> 45:13.378
Oh.

45:14.579 --> 45:15.613
Are you okay?

45:15.680 --> 45:16.948
Yeah. This..

45:17.015 --> 45:18.583
This 17-year-old girl
came in last night

45:18.649 --> 45:20.151
with alcohol poisoning

45:20.218 --> 45:21.186
BA, 420.

45:21.252 --> 45:22.788
- Mm.
- Still hasn't come around.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.622
She was texting
her friend all night

45:24.689 --> 45:26.024
telling her
she was throwing up.

45:26.091 --> 45:27.725
Her friend thought it was cool.

45:29.961 --> 45:31.997
Mr. Manning.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.731
Marjorie's not doing
too well, huh?

45:37.969 --> 45:39.470
(Carter)
I know a lot of us never

45:39.537 --> 45:43.174
actually thought
that this day would come.

45:43.241 --> 45:45.710
In fact..I think
I was one of them.

45:45.777 --> 45:47.278
[laughing]

45:47.345 --> 45:51.382
But here we are,
in this beautiful facility

45:51.449 --> 45:54.019
finally ready to provide

45:54.085 --> 45:55.987
state-of-the-art
outpatient services

45:56.054 --> 45:58.957
to the HIV/AIDS community,
the homeless

45:59.024 --> 46:00.225
families in need.

46:01.259 --> 46:04.262
Medical care,
dental care, day care..

46:05.463 --> 46:06.564
...counseling.

46:06.631 --> 46:07.966
Services.

46:08.033 --> 46:09.567
Services that have
been sorely lacking

46:09.634 --> 46:11.769
at County for many years.

46:11.837 --> 46:13.404
I, uh..

46:13.471 --> 46:16.174
don't wanna try your patience
by rambling on too long.

46:16.241 --> 46:18.443
Um, but I hope
you'll bear with me

46:18.509 --> 46:19.878
'for a moment'

46:19.945 --> 46:22.113
'while I talk about
why we chose to name this'

46:22.180 --> 46:23.781
'the Joshua Carter Center.'

46:26.184 --> 46:29.020
'My wife and I had a son'

46:30.488 --> 46:32.023
and we named him Joshua.

46:34.725 --> 46:35.961
And he died.

46:36.027 --> 46:37.762
[dramatic music]

46:37.829 --> 46:39.664
[clears throat]
Excuse me.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.066
And it seemed so..

46:41.132 --> 46:44.035
It seemed so senseless
that we..

46:48.106 --> 46:49.174
That we, my wife and I

46:49.240 --> 46:52.010
we struggled to find some..

46:53.678 --> 46:55.213
...sort of meaning in it.

46:57.315 --> 47:01.152
'And, in the aftermath
of our small tragedy'

47:01.219 --> 47:03.922
'we realized that we could
make a difference'

47:03.989 --> 47:06.157
'in other people's lives.'

47:06.224 --> 47:11.129
Other people experiencing
their own small tragedies.

47:12.730 --> 47:15.266
'And that made, somehow..'

47:15.333 --> 47:18.536
'...the loss
of Joshua bearable.'

47:18.603 --> 47:20.571
[dramatic music]

47:23.674 --> 47:24.842
Thank you so much for coming.

47:24.910 --> 47:27.212
[cheering]

47:40.791 --> 47:43.028
- Well done, Carter.
- I didn't embarrass myself?

47:43.094 --> 47:44.362
I wouldn't go that far.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.272
You came.

47:55.606 --> 47:56.774
I didn't think you would.

47:56.841 --> 47:58.643
[chuckles]
Neither did I.

48:01.012 --> 48:04.215
Sorry I was late.
Flight was delayed.

48:04.282 --> 48:05.250
That's..

48:06.617 --> 48:07.919
That was a beautiful speech.

48:07.986 --> 48:09.087
(male #1)
'Hey, John.'

48:09.154 --> 48:10.455
I just want you
to meet Wendy Spence

48:10.521 --> 48:13.091
from the Fort Foundation.
Right over here.

48:16.461 --> 48:18.863
(Tony)
'Your wife has low blood
pressure from the sepsis'

48:18.930 --> 48:20.231
but giving her IV fluids

48:20.298 --> 48:23.234
will only cause more
damage to the lungs.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.403
'We discussed this'

48:25.470 --> 48:26.871
'when you wanted
to take her home, Paul'

48:26.938 --> 48:29.607
that this would
most likely happen.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.110
I didn't realize.

48:32.177 --> 48:34.712
Please. Do something.

48:34.779 --> 48:38.449
Marjorie has a DNR. She doesn't
want us to intervene.

48:38.516 --> 48:42.053
Oh. I've got her
power of attorney here.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.454
Out here, uh..

48:43.521 --> 48:46.224
That-that means I can decide
for her, right?

48:48.926 --> 48:51.262
Your wife has a
degenerative disease

48:51.329 --> 48:54.299
that's left her debilitated

48:54.365 --> 48:57.268
without enough strength
to fight off this infection.

48:57.335 --> 49:00.171
Even with aggressive treatment..

49:00.238 --> 49:03.374
'She would only live a week
or two in the ICU on machines.'

49:04.242 --> 49:07.045
A ventilator, dialysis, IV pumps

49:07.112 --> 49:09.714
to keep her blood pressure up.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.183
It's only going to prolong
her pain and suffering.

49:16.087 --> 49:18.189
I'm not ready to lose her.

49:18.823 --> 49:20.958
[dramatic music]

49:24.329 --> 49:25.796
It's time to talk
about how to make her

49:25.863 --> 49:27.365
as comfortable as possible.

49:28.866 --> 49:30.035
[sighs]

49:32.003 --> 49:33.671
[gasping]

49:36.941 --> 49:38.243
Paul?

49:47.818 --> 49:49.887
Excuse me. I'm here
to check on a patient.

49:49.954 --> 49:51.322
- And you are?
- Dr. Wise from the ER.

49:51.389 --> 49:52.723
I called, but I got put on hold.

49:52.790 --> 49:55.426
Yeah, we're swamped.
Couple of people called in sick.

49:55.493 --> 49:56.527
Stomach flu.

49:56.594 --> 49:58.296
We brought a woman up,
inverted uterus

49:58.363 --> 49:59.564
bleeding with an accreta.

49:59.630 --> 50:01.299
- 'Her name's Salamunovich.'
- Uh..

50:01.366 --> 50:02.967
Dr. Zwerling just went out
to find the family.

50:03.034 --> 50:05.236
They're still downstairs.
They have a bunch of kids.

50:05.303 --> 50:07.105
One of the twins had mec.

50:07.172 --> 50:09.274
Did she have to have
the hysterectomy?

50:09.340 --> 50:10.708
No, she went into DIC.

50:10.775 --> 50:13.078
They coded her for over
an hour, and she died.

50:18.183 --> 50:22.187
* Happy birthday to you *

50:22.253 --> 50:25.923
* Happy birthday to you *

50:25.990 --> 50:31.862
* Happy birthday dear Sam *

50:31.929 --> 50:36.267
* Happy birthday to you *

50:36.334 --> 50:38.236
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

50:38.303 --> 50:40.271
Here, make a wish
and blow out the candles.

50:42.340 --> 50:43.508
- 'Ah!'
- There.

50:43.574 --> 50:44.909
[cheering]

50:44.975 --> 50:47.011
Very funny. Very funny.

50:47.078 --> 50:48.045
What did you wish?

50:48.113 --> 50:49.080
I wished that nobody told

50:49.147 --> 50:50.148
you guys it was my birthday.

50:50.215 --> 50:51.249
(Chuny)
'Cut the cake.'

50:51.316 --> 50:52.583
Hey. What are you doing here?

50:52.650 --> 50:54.552
I wanted to give you
your present.

50:54.619 --> 50:56.587
- How did you get here?
- I drove.

50:56.654 --> 50:57.755
Drove? Drove what?

50:57.822 --> 50:59.124
Well, you wanna see it?

51:00.024 --> 51:01.492
Go ahead. We got it.

51:04.829 --> 51:05.963
Hey.

51:06.030 --> 51:07.498
'The twins are doing great.'

51:07.565 --> 51:09.400
'They're keeping one
overnight in the NICU'

51:09.467 --> 51:12.270
but the other one's already
on the way to the nursery.

51:13.638 --> 51:14.605
'What?'

51:18.809 --> 51:20.445
- What are you doing, Alex?
- Just one second.

51:20.511 --> 51:22.247
- Just give me one second.
- I'm working.

51:22.313 --> 51:23.614
Mom, just one minute.
You'll love it.

51:25.116 --> 51:26.384
What are you doing?

51:33.658 --> 51:34.659
You drove that?

51:35.960 --> 51:37.128
'Whose car is that?'

51:38.629 --> 51:40.131
Alex.

51:40.198 --> 51:42.767
- 'Do they know you have it?'
- Mom.

51:42.833 --> 51:45.636
Nobody is going to let a
16-year-old kid drive that car.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.172
Open this.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.373
Whose car is that, Alex?

51:48.439 --> 51:49.740
Just open the box.

51:53.644 --> 51:54.779
Mom, it's yours.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.815
It was pretty
banged up at first

51:57.882 --> 51:59.450
but Tony helped me fix it up.

51:59.517 --> 52:01.586
- Alex did all the work.
- No. No.

52:05.323 --> 52:06.457
- Get in.
- What?

52:06.524 --> 52:08.092
- 'Go.'
- Go, Mom.

52:08.159 --> 52:10.428
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

52:13.164 --> 52:14.332
Oh..

52:16.734 --> 52:17.868
It's beautiful.

52:19.670 --> 52:20.871
Are you serious?

52:20.938 --> 52:22.139
'Are you..'

52:25.910 --> 52:27.044
Mom, just turn it over.

52:27.111 --> 52:28.379
[engine revving]

52:29.247 --> 52:30.581
Oh, my God!

52:42.393 --> 52:44.462
(Julia)
'I don't know if I can do this.'

52:47.232 --> 52:48.866
Do what?

52:48.933 --> 52:50.968
This.

52:51.035 --> 52:52.603
Every day.

52:52.670 --> 52:53.904
'Sure, you can.'

52:53.971 --> 52:56.941
People need help,
and you know how to help them.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.576
And if I can't help them?

53:03.314 --> 53:04.482
You do the best you can.

53:05.850 --> 53:07.352
'Then you go home,
you get some sleep'

53:07.418 --> 53:08.986
'and you come back
the next day.'

53:09.053 --> 53:10.355
'And you help the next one.'

53:15.826 --> 53:16.961
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:26.904 --> 53:28.038
Ah, I should have grabbed
a jacket. It's freezing.

53:28.105 --> 53:29.507
It feels good. I like it brisk.

53:29.574 --> 53:30.808
Brisk? You could
hang meat out here.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.577
- I can't feel my feet.
- So go wait inside.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.312
Not like we need you
to push a couple gurneys.

53:34.379 --> 53:35.346
Global warming?

53:35.413 --> 53:36.381
A couple of these scientists

53:36.447 --> 53:37.882
should spend April in Chicago.

53:37.948 --> 53:40.285
49-year-old woman laceration
to the right forehead

53:40.351 --> 53:41.952
from a broken bottle
vitals stable en route.

53:42.019 --> 53:43.888
- What happened?
- Drunken brawl at the Marriott.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.790
The bitch cut me.
I can't believe it.

53:45.856 --> 53:48.393
It was a free-for-all. Chairs
flying, champagne bottles.

53:48.459 --> 53:49.860
We got there first,
had to wait for the cops

53:49.927 --> 53:50.961
to arrive to break it up.

53:51.028 --> 53:52.863
Right. Take her.
I'll get the next one.

53:52.930 --> 53:54.832
28-year-old female.
Blunt trauma to the head

53:54.899 --> 53:56.934
and superficial lacerations
to the left forearm.

53:57.001 --> 53:58.403
She broke my damn arm.

53:58.469 --> 53:59.804
Tiffany, you're dead!
You hear me? You're dead.

53:59.870 --> 54:01.339
You're the one that
hit me with a chair!

54:01.406 --> 54:02.540
You wouldn't have believed it.

54:02.607 --> 54:04.041
It was like All-Star
Wrestling in there.

54:04.108 --> 54:05.109
- At a wedding?
- My wedding!

54:05.175 --> 54:06.611
You did this
at my wedding, Mom!

54:06.677 --> 54:08.045
That's what you wanted
all along, right? Isn't it?

54:08.112 --> 54:09.314
To ruin it, ruin everything?

54:09.380 --> 54:10.515
- That's your mother?
- Worse.

54:10.581 --> 54:12.283
My new mother-in-law.

54:14.018 --> 54:16.487
[indistinct chatter]

54:16.554 --> 54:18.088
- Totally not true.
- Yes, it is.

54:18.155 --> 54:19.690
You were there. Yes!

54:19.757 --> 54:20.525
No, I never

54:20.591 --> 54:21.792
pulled a guy's Foley

54:21.859 --> 54:23.361
without deflating
the balloon first.

54:23.428 --> 54:25.530
Yes, you did.
And the patient was so angry

54:25.596 --> 54:27.031
'he threw an emesis
basin at his head..'

54:27.097 --> 54:29.166
A Foley is for collecting urine.

54:29.233 --> 54:31.969
(Susan)
'Yes, and what about the time
where he got crazy'

54:32.036 --> 54:34.372
'with the Dermabond and glued
the lady's eye shut?'

54:34.439 --> 54:35.806
Okay, that I did do, actually.

54:35.873 --> 54:37.408
What about the time
when he spent

54:37.475 --> 54:39.143
like, three hours
doing a one-inch head lac

54:39.209 --> 54:41.111
without an X-ray, then, all
of the sudden, he discovers

54:41.178 --> 54:43.180
there's still glass in it and he
had to go back and do it again?

54:43.247 --> 54:45.816
[scoffs]
Really glad you came.
Don't believe them, Reese.

54:45.883 --> 54:48.586
So, should we head out
for a nightcap?

54:48.653 --> 54:49.754
Oh, yeah. I'm in.
You coming?

54:49.820 --> 54:50.988
Ah, you know what?
I gotta get

54:51.055 --> 54:52.156
this young man home.

54:52.222 --> 54:54.425
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

54:54.492 --> 54:55.760
It's a school night.

54:57.395 --> 54:58.696
No. Get you home. Go to sleep.

54:58.763 --> 54:59.997
(Susan)
'Why don't you drop Reese off'

55:00.064 --> 55:01.131
with Cleo, then come back out?

55:01.198 --> 55:02.166
The night's young.

55:02.232 --> 55:03.368
I was gonna try Elizabeth.

55:03.434 --> 55:05.135
See if they wanna drop by.

55:05.202 --> 55:06.537
(Susan)
'Great.'

55:08.573 --> 55:10.775
Elizabeth is an old friend.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.310
No. A friend.

55:13.378 --> 55:14.945
Mm-hmm.

55:15.012 --> 55:16.080
- 'So'
- So, we in?

55:16.146 --> 55:18.048
- 'Yeah.'
- Uh, you know, maybe. Maybe.

55:18.115 --> 55:19.450
- Yeah.
- Alright.

55:19.517 --> 55:20.718
(Kerry)
'Alright. Ready?'

55:20.785 --> 55:22.186
- 'Yeah.'
- Meet you there.

55:22.252 --> 55:23.588
- Yeah, great.
- See you later.

55:28.426 --> 55:30.461
What were you talking about?

55:30.528 --> 55:31.862
- What?
- With Kerry Weaver.

55:31.929 --> 55:33.864
Oh..

55:33.931 --> 55:36.901
Africa. She was back
just last summer..

55:37.668 --> 55:38.836
...to visit friends.

55:42.473 --> 55:43.974
It's gorgeous, John.

55:52.149 --> 55:55.986
Do you, uh, wanna
join us for drinks?

55:56.954 --> 55:58.022
I'm a bit tired.

56:00.257 --> 56:01.926
It's 5:00 a.m. in Paris.

56:03.761 --> 56:05.430
How long are you staying?

56:07.732 --> 56:09.099
I leave tomorrow night.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.541
[dramatic music]

56:16.607 --> 56:18.409
It's hard for me
to be here, John.

56:18.476 --> 56:19.644
I know.

56:20.545 --> 56:21.779
I'm glad you came.

56:23.448 --> 56:24.749
Me, too.

56:32.322 --> 56:33.858
Can I buy you lunch tomorrow?

56:33.924 --> 56:35.993
We'll go to Shaw's.
Eat too much seafood.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.229
Take a walk by the lake.

56:39.296 --> 56:40.831
It's supposed to be a nice day.

56:44.669 --> 56:46.303
I was thinking about Joshua.

56:46.370 --> 56:48.673
[music continues]

56:48.739 --> 56:51.408
He'd be five, nearly six.

56:53.143 --> 56:54.645
I think about him

56:54.712 --> 56:56.046
almost every day.

56:58.415 --> 56:59.584
Lunch?

57:03.954 --> 57:04.922
Maybe.

57:08.459 --> 57:09.694
Call me in the morning.

57:10.895 --> 57:11.862
Kem..

57:19.537 --> 57:20.571
(Tracy)
78-year-old man

57:20.638 --> 57:22.172
'in from the nursing home'

57:22.239 --> 57:26.176
'with penile pain,
deformity, and bruising.'

57:26.243 --> 57:27.712
'Sorry I called you in on this.'

57:27.778 --> 57:29.446
'I just don't feel very
comfortable with him alone.'

57:29.514 --> 57:31.949
'He's kind of...randy.'

57:33.050 --> 57:34.418
Welcome back, doc.

57:34.485 --> 57:36.153
You bring yourself a chaperone?

57:36.220 --> 57:38.689
Mr. Thunhurst,
you're having penile pain?

57:38.756 --> 57:41.692
Oh. Hurts
like a son of a bitch, Doc.

57:41.759 --> 57:42.993
Let's take a look.

57:45.963 --> 57:48.733
You're, uh,
sexually active, I take it?

57:48.799 --> 57:51.836
Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't
need Viagra, either.

57:53.170 --> 57:55.239
The odds at the
nursing home are great.

57:55.305 --> 57:58.509
I mean, women outlive men.
It's at least four to one.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.011
[grunts]

58:02.479 --> 58:03.548
You use condoms, I take it?

58:03.614 --> 58:05.616
Oh, you betcha..

58:05.683 --> 58:07.618
The big ones.

58:07.685 --> 58:10.555
Alright, you, uh,
fractured your penis.

58:10.621 --> 58:11.789
Fractured?

58:14.158 --> 58:15.459
There's a bone in there?

58:15.526 --> 58:17.728
No bone, a tear
of a fibrous sheath

58:17.795 --> 58:19.930
called the Tunica albuginea.

58:19.997 --> 58:22.700
'Swelling, bruising, hematoma,
standard eggplant deformity'

58:22.767 --> 58:23.901
tender to the touch.

58:23.968 --> 58:25.302
Usually happens
when a female's on top.

58:25.369 --> 58:26.737
Was your partner on top, sir?

58:26.804 --> 58:27.838
What? Cowgirl position?

58:27.905 --> 58:30.140
Oh, no, no, that's not for me.

58:30.207 --> 58:32.109
We were going at it
at the nurses' station

58:32.176 --> 58:34.979
while they were running
the movie night.

58:35.045 --> 58:38.883
I slipped out, and Mr. Fred
hit the edge of the desk.

58:41.652 --> 58:43.453
Alright, he's gonna need
a retrograde urethrogram

58:43.520 --> 58:44.521
to make sure there's no damage

58:44.589 --> 58:45.823
and surgery to evacuate

58:45.890 --> 58:47.524
the hematoma
and repair the albuginea.

58:47.592 --> 58:49.026
- Mm-hmm.
- Tony?

58:49.093 --> 58:50.661
'Surgery?'

58:50.728 --> 58:52.096
How long am I
gonna be out of action?

58:52.162 --> 58:53.230
About six weeks.

58:53.297 --> 58:54.732
Good Lord.

58:56.634 --> 58:58.168
What am I gonna tell the girls?

59:02.807 --> 59:04.141
Paramedics have a chest pain

59:04.208 --> 59:05.475
and the MS lady's breathing

59:05.542 --> 59:06.711
is scaring the hell
out of her husband.

59:06.777 --> 59:08.312
So, you like the car?

59:08.378 --> 59:10.180
Oh, it's incredible

59:10.247 --> 59:12.249
and amazingly cool

59:12.316 --> 59:14.184
but I can't keep it.

59:14.251 --> 59:15.620
Why not?

59:15.686 --> 59:17.722
Because Alex couldn't have
afforded to do that.

59:17.788 --> 59:19.690
I barely give him enough
to support his iTunes habit.

59:19.757 --> 59:21.692
He worked his ass off
on that car.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.628
I can't take a car
from you, Tony.

59:23.694 --> 59:24.962
It was a piece of junk.

59:25.029 --> 59:26.664
He did all the work.
We found the parts.

59:26.731 --> 59:29.299
It still must've cost you
hundreds of dollars.

59:29.366 --> 59:30.868
Thousands of dollars?

59:30.935 --> 59:32.903
Alex learned how to rebuild
a car from the struts up.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.371
You don't take it,
you're gonna break his heart.

59:34.438 --> 59:35.840
Hey, that rule MI's pulling up.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.107
Alright, talk Mr. Manning

59:37.174 --> 59:38.743
through what's going
on with his wife

59:38.809 --> 59:40.244
and tell him I'll be
in there as soon as I can.

59:40.310 --> 59:42.146
Sam, if you're thinking
about selling the Mustang

59:42.212 --> 59:44.615
I will give you $500 cash
for it right now.

59:44.682 --> 59:47.151
- Go away, Jerry.
- $700?

59:47.217 --> 59:49.854
- Oh, is Dr. Gates coming?
- He'll be here soon.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.489
Because she,
she stopped breathing

59:52.556 --> 59:54.391
and I thought she was gonna..

59:54.458 --> 59:55.926
and then she started up again.

59:55.993 --> 59:59.630
Yeah, her irregular breathing
is completely natural.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:00.965
Ah..

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:04.068
It's, uh, all part
of the dying process.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:06.837
[groans]

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.510
72 years..

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:14.544
I'm sorry?

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:15.846
'72 years.'

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:18.783
I met her in the sixth grade.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:22.687
That's how long we've known
each other, 72 years.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.855
And her family had moved in
from Nebraska

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:26.056
because they lost their farm

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.758
you know, during the Depression.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:30.227
'And..'

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:31.896
'Mrs..'

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.031
Mrs. Ross, our teacher..

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:39.203
She said to take the empty desk
next to mine...

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:44.074
That was it.

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:49.747
'You know..'

01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:54.318
'I never looked
at another girl for 72 years.'

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.686
You hear that, Mrs. Manning?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.255
Not once, sweetheart.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.564
Excuse me.

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:09.867
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:15.272
(Susan)
'Yeah, just, like, let it out.'

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.842
Well, this is a thoroughly
disreputable-looking group.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:21.378
Oh, my God, Elizabeth!
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:22.980
- How are you, sweetheart?
- I'm good.

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:25.415
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi!

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.984
- John.
- Thank God you showed.

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.252
You were the bait we used to

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:29.486
lure him out late
on a school night.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.654
Oh, come on. That's not true.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:32.056
You remember Rachel.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.491
- Hey.
- 'Oh, my goodness.'

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:35.793
- Hello, Peter.
- Hey.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.995
I've known you since
you were this big.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:40.497
Yes, I know,
Everyone's been saying that.

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:42.266
Well, I can imagine.
Look at you!

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:43.500
What can I get you?

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:44.668
Oh, I'll just have
a cranberry juice.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:45.736
- You look great.
- Thank you.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:46.837
Hey, and for you?

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:49.006
I'd like a margarita, no salt.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:51.742
- 'See some ID?'
- 'Absolutely.'

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:53.778
- Oh, my God!
- So, how's Ella?

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:56.013
Oh, she's nine and gorgeous.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.849
Now, Peter, you and Cleo
are still right?

01:01:58.916 --> 01:01:59.917
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:01.485
She's an associate professor

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.686
at University of Chicago.

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.388
(Susan)
'Oh, no, no, I'm dating again.'

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.490
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.562
Roger Anderson, 48,
with eight hours

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:13.630
of substernal chest pain.

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:14.731
Why'd you wait so long?

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:15.933
I thought it would go away.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.634
Good vitals, no ST changes.

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:19.103
Am I having a heart attack?

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.071
(Tony)
'Too soon to tell.'

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.808
(Linda)
'Unbelievable. First she traps
Donnie into getting married'

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.075
by getting herself pregnant.

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:26.310
(Tiffany)
'Right, innocent little Donnie'

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.411
'perfect little Donnie.'

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.879
I have news for you, Linda

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:30.414
your little Donnie
'bout raped me in the backseat

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.748
of his Camaro.

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:32.983
I warned him,
I warned him from day one

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.184
that all she was after was

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.519
his paycheck
and health benefits.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.121
Oh, right,
his incredible salary working

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:38.155
for the post office. Ouch!

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:39.723
'Then she insisted on inviting'

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.059
all of her inbred Kentucky
relatives to the reception.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:44.061
Hey, it wasn't my Uncle Phil
who was found pissing

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:45.529
in the lobby fountain! Ouch!

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.864
Keep still then.

01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:48.332
Am I gonna have a scar?

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:49.566
A little one.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:51.969
You hear that, Tiffany?
I'm gonna have a scar.

01:02:52.036 --> 01:02:53.103
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be on

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.171
my once-in-a-lifetime

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:55.405
Caribbean beach honeymoon

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:56.540
with a cast on my arm!

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.741
Tiff, are you okay?

01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:59.709
Oh, honey, baby,
she broke my arm.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.946
Donnie? Donnie, is that you?

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:04.849
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:06.851
Donnie, she cut me.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:08.518
I'm getting stitches in my face!

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.354
- Donnie, hold my hand, please.
- Donnie, come here.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.755
'Come here and see
what she did to me.'

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:12.857
Donnie, sweetheart?

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:14.058
- Donnie, hold my hand.
- Donnie?

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.559
- Donnie?
- Donnie.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.161
- Donnie, come here right now.
- Donnie, come here!

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:18.996
Donnie, you come here right now!

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.066
(Samantha)
'I wanna prepare you.'

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.234
Your mom is unconscious

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.971
and the sepsis has made
her breathing more difficult.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:28.305
We have her on oxygen to help

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.440
and Morphine
to relieve any pain.

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:32.542
So she's dying?

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:35.279
Yeah.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.313
Soon?

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:38.148
Probably.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.486
'Would you look at that?'

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:43.553
How much he loves her.

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:48.058
I never could understand
how he put up with that woman.

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.427
Tough as nails.

01:03:51.896 --> 01:03:54.598
Hard on him, hard on us.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.300
[dramatic music]

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:58.402
'Then she gets sick,
and he takes care of her'

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:01.371
'for all these years.'

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.874
'I would have left her by the
side of the road somewhere.'

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:06.810
You know what
I was doing in the car

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.946
the whole way down
from Milwaukee?

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:13.083
Crying.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.418
Crying my eyes out.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.186
Beating myself up trying
to remember what it was

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:18.855
we fought about
last time we talked.

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:21.191
Isn't that something?

01:04:23.827 --> 01:04:25.295
As if it mattered anymore.

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:31.268
[music continues]

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:58.662
Hey, um, you mind if I eat
this last piece of cake?

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.297
No, knock yourself out.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:01.331
Thank you.

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:04.368
[telephone ringing]

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:06.470
ER.

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:08.505
Yeah.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:09.806
What's up?

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:11.508
[dramatic music]

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:13.243
I know, Soldier Field.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:17.381
No, Tommy's gonna
get us tickets.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:20.317
Yeah...that's fine.

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:33.397
Mom. Hey, did I wake you?

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:37.634
Uh, yeah.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.970
Oh, who, who does Leno have on?

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.074
No, I'm working tonight.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:48.078
How was your day?

01:05:50.747 --> 01:05:52.116
Yeah, they got me a cake.

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:55.285
Chocolate.

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:57.154
That crazy grandson of yours,
Alex, tell you

01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.722
what he got me for my birthday?

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:01.491
A car.

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:03.727
No..

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.197
Ah!

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:10.167
- Whoa!
- It got so cold!

01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:11.435
(John)
So you wanna come and see

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.170
what a real doctor
does for a living?

01:06:13.237 --> 01:06:15.672
Oh, yes, a doctor
in an underfunded

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:17.641
over-utilized, insane asylum

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.110
that passes for an
urban medical center.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:22.079
- I'm in.
- Oh, no, it's very late.

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:24.281
- Oh!
- Don't start.

01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:25.882
Well, how are you gonna
get back to the hotel?

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:27.184
- I'll call a cab.
- Oh, come on.

01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:28.818
She's not a baby anymore.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:30.054
We'll make sure
she gets back safely.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.221
You gonna come, Kerry?

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:32.989
No, I've got an early flight.

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:36.726
- Peter?
- No, 7:00 a.m. rounds.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.729
Ah, there's a cab.

01:06:39.796 --> 01:06:40.897
I'm gonna go.

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:42.132
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:54.010
So good seeing you.

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:56.012
Alright, bye, guys.

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:06.790
Well, ready?

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.528
Hey, our flight leaves at 9:00!

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:14.231
The car's coming to pick us up
at the hotel at 7:00!

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.701
[sighs]
Kids.

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.504
She's not a kid anymore.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.672
Yeah, her mother would
absolutely kill me

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.174
if she knew I'd let
Carter haul her off

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.642
to the ER in the middle
of the night

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.311
on a field trip.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:30.380
Hey, uh, want me
to get you a cab?

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.582
Oh, uh, no.
I've got a rental car.

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.551
Alright. Well,
want me to walk you?

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:37.921
Um...sure.

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:39.556
Thanks. Yeah.

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:45.562
So...is Cleo good?

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.165
Yeah, really good.

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:51.034
Do you have any more children?

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.403
No, no, no, no. What about you?

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.639
- What about me?
- Do you have any more kids?

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:57.474
Oh, no, no.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:00.410
Are you, uh, in, a relationship?

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:03.012
- No.
- Dating?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.548
No, not really.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.983
Uh, well, I've got
a nine-year-old

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:10.120
at home and a busy career.

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:11.621
Maybe when Ella's
a little older

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.290
I might, but, uh..

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.126
So..

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:20.163
This is me.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.198
[horn honks]

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:23.533
[laughing]

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.403
As usual, there was a problem
with the rental reservation.

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:27.737
This is all they had.

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:30.907
It's, um..

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:31.941
It's big.

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:34.611
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:37.913
Well, you know, if you need
to transport an infantry

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:39.115
for any reason, uh..

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:41.751
[laughs]
Yeah, or a rap star's entourage.

01:08:45.889 --> 01:08:46.923
Anyway..

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.792
[dramatic music]

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.660
It was really nice
seeing you again, Peter.

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.162
Yeah, it was.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:08:58.868
Take care.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.423
[music continues]

01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:30.700
[siren wailing]

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.505
(John)
'Jerry, you remember Rachel?'

01:09:35.572 --> 01:09:37.073
Yeah, I heard you were around.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.942
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi. You remember me?

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.478
- No way!
- Jerry!

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:43.380
There's a spirit
of camaraderie around here.

01:09:43.447 --> 01:09:45.148
It's kind of what
makes this place work.

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:47.183
Everybody helps
everybody else out.

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:49.919
Oh, God, maggots.

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:51.688
Tracy, this is Rachel.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:54.358
She's thinking about a career
in emergency medicine.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.660
Run, don't walk, to radiology.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:00.564
Trust me, you don't ever,
ever want to have to do this.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.432
(male #2)
'I am the chosen one.'

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:03.467
Come to be known as Uhdia..

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.034
Ten of Haldol and restraints!

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:08.071
...and he who believeth in me
shall have eternal life!

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.306
(John)
'Hey, Morris.'

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.574
Hey, Carter.
How'd the opening go?

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.975
It was good.
Sorry you missed it.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.277
Well, you know work.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:14.578
Can't wait to see it
when it's finished.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.112
Give me a call.
I'll give you a tour.

01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:17.514
Rachel? Rachel Greene?

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:18.948
- Hi, Chuny.
- Oh, my God.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.884
Look at you. You going
to be around for a while?

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:21.918
Sure.

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.052
Don't you dare leave

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:24.254
before we get
a chance to catch up.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.722
And I will deliver..

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:29.726
Haldol, miracle drug.

01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:35.632
Laverne, what have you got?

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.133
Mr. Meyer here polished off

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.168
a few too many bottles
of fine burgundy

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.137
fell off the curb
in front of Spiaggia

01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:42.406
broke his ankle, hit his head.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:43.540
Waiting on CT and Ortho.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:44.908
Mind if I take over the IV?

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.310
Oh, sure, no problem.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.079
You ever done
one of these before?

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:51.381
No.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:55.251
Okay. Well, we use an angiocath

01:10:55.319 --> 01:10:56.520
with a 16-gauge needle.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.322
It's a large bore,
but you need that in case

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:00.256
there's bleeding
and you have to transfuse him.

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:01.691
What you want to do

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.361
is pull that skin tight
so that the vein doesn't roll

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:06.095
go in low, bevel up.

01:11:06.162 --> 01:11:08.832
Once you're in the vein you
just pull this little gizmo out

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:09.933
and tape it down.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.968
Gates, is it my imagination

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:14.838
or is Dr. Carter,
who is not on duty, by the way

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:17.874
in Trauma 1 with a patient
demonstrating IV placement

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:18.908
to a college student?

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.209
What?

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.478
Never mind.

01:11:21.545 --> 01:11:24.414
Jerry, why is
Dr. Carter performing

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.916
medical procedures
on our patients?

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:29.319
Uh...because he's a doctor?

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:33.423
Tony?

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:36.460
Excuse me one second.

01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:37.827
Perfect timing.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:39.228
That poor bastard's son
and daughter are having..

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.564
Marjorie Manning died.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.869
[flatline]

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:01.818
So...

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.054
That's it?

01:12:09.393 --> 01:12:11.260
[sobbing]

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.697
[dramatic music]

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:22.406
Can I stay with her..

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:25.074
...a little longer?

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:27.310
Of course.

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:28.712
Stay as long as you'd like.

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:46.963
Oh, yeah.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.364
Pizza!

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:55.371
[sighs]
Okay..

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:57.441
What is that?

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.008
Uh, meat lovers' special.

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.309
You want a piece?

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.745
You better call a cardiologist

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:03.513
and schedule your
first angioplasty.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.148
Mm, it's good.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.683
How old are you?

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.117
- 37.
- Hmm, yeah,

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:10.019
Make an appointment
for three years from now.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:13.723
You keep eating like that,
40 ought to be just about right.

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:15.124
(Susan)
'No, come on!'

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:16.192
(Chuny)
'It's true!'

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:19.162
[laughing]

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.997
You're right,
they don't get it.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:22.031
They don't get it!

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:23.166
Who are you?

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.101
Oh, hi, I'm, uh,
Dr. Susan Lewis.

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:26.269
I used to work here.

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.804
- Hi.
- Hmm..

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.806
What is it with men
and their penises?

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:32.308
Oh, yeah, I've been trying to
figure that one out for years.

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:33.710
Amen to that.

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:35.479
My trouble-urinating guy?

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.647
It turns out that he has
erectile dysfunction

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.248
and he can't afford Viagra.

01:13:39.315 --> 01:13:40.817
So, he takes a tube
of bathroom caulk

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:42.418
the kind you use around the tub

01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:43.787
and squeezes it
into his urethra.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.321
It's not a religious talisman.

01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:47.090
Get that thing
in a biohazard bag.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.858
Police brought in
an altered old woman

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.060
found her on the street
wearing one of our bracelets.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.128
It had your name on it.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.298
(Archie)
'Beverly?'

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:56.666
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:58.101
How's her temperature?

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.969
Core is 96.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.137
My name is Beverly.

01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:02.238
Yes, I know.

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:03.439
She was in here yesterday.

01:14:03.507 --> 01:14:04.874
Her daughter's name and number

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.442
should be in the chart
here somewhere.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.344
- Martha or Mary...
- Margaret.

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:09.613
Margaret, that's right.

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:10.914
You know, she's gonna be worried

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.315
about where you are.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:14.017
Margaret is a lovely girl.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.952
Just quiet and thoughtful.

01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:19.322
How's your wrist? Any pain?

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.724
- I broke my wrist.
- I know.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.225
I fixed it yesterday.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.727
I fell out of a tree.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.129
Margaret was telling me
to go higher and I fell.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.097
Really? Margaret was
telling you to go higher?

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:29.332
Mm-hmm, she's..

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.734
Margaret's my sister.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.703
'Just a lovely girl.'

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:35.639
You know, you really
shouldn't leave your yard.

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:37.841
It's not safe.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.143
Ooh, you have such strong hands.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.278
Warm and strong.

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:45.915
You can tell a lot
about a man by his hands.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.151
Yes, ma'am.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.221
[dramatic music]

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.998
Where's the daughter?

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:04.634
Uh, she went to call
the mortuary, I think.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.504
Thanks.

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:11.575
For what?

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.844
For everything you do with Alex.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:18.081
I really appreciate it.

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:22.719
[music continues]

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:47.176
Wow..

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:51.347
A little cold out here to be
playing basketball, huh?

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:52.582
I'm just trying to stay awake.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:54.383
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:55.685
I've got a, um..

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:59.255
Important phone call to make
in a couple hours.

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:01.591
I'm afraid if I close my eyes,
I'll sleep through it.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.327
Don't you own an alarm clock?

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:06.663
Oh..

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.565
Can't chance it.

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:10.800
Yeah?

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:13.903
- Love or money?
- What?

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:15.204
Well, if it's that important

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:17.040
it can only be,
uh, one of two things

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:18.074
love or money.

01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:22.812
- Love!
- Oh!

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:25.014
Hey! Put a towel
around that guy!

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.683
- 'There's women in there!'
- Whoa!

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.017
I thought streakers
went out with disco

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.485
and the Ford administration.

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:30.720
I'm going across the street.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:31.988
You guys want
a microwave burrito?

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:33.289
- Bean and beef is pretty good.
- I'm fine.

01:16:33.356 --> 01:16:34.758
I'll pass.

01:16:34.824 --> 01:16:36.893
Man's a culinary
freak of nature.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:40.830
Nice.

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:43.700
Where's your little ward?

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:45.034
Who, Rachel?

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:47.036
The women stole her
from me an hour ago.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.877
- Coming back, boss?
- What?

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.611
You're hanging
around here enough.

01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:57.613
Take some shifts.
Get paid for it.

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:00.884
I don't know. Maybe.

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:03.853
Hey, Tony, I need you.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.370
Those transport guys
from Mercy

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:23.940
finally showed up for your
alcohol poisoning girl.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.174
Soon as they tried to move her

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:27.143
she started groaning
and thrashing around.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.277
Is she responsive?

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.246
I didn't stick around
long enough to find out.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.347
Went looking for you.

01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:39.088
- Stacey?
- What? What's happening?

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.790
Stacey? Alright,
she responds to stimuli.

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:42.926
- What does that mean?
- Stacey, can you hear me?

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.027
- 'Honey..'
- Stacey, alright

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:45.361
you're in the hospital.

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:46.996
Okay, I'm Dr. Gates.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:48.264
You were at a party last night.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.733
You had a little too much
to drink.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.300
- Stacey?
- Please, is she alright?

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:57.073
Stacey? Stacey?

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.575
I need another CT, guys.
It's gonna take a little while.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:00.877
- How long?
- Hour, maybe two.

01:18:00.944 --> 01:18:02.846
I'll call Dispatch.

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:04.147
(Mark)
'Doctor?'

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:08.184
She's responding,
but not in a purposeful way.

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:10.920
'It may be a sign of lack
of oxygen to the brain.'

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:12.922
'I'm gonna order another CT'

01:18:12.989 --> 01:18:14.390
'make sure there's no
swelling in the brain.'

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:15.859
But she's going to be okay?

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:18.127
Well, it's too early to tell
if her mental status

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:20.997
will improve from, um,
from what you see now.

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:22.799
- 'But it could?'
- 'Maybe in time.'

01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:24.333
CT can take her now.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.735
Okay, good.

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:27.336
Can we go with her?

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:28.371
Of course, yeah.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.027
(Tracy)
My first ER rotation

01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:52.929
they sent me to a jail
ward to do a rectal

01:18:52.996 --> 01:18:54.798
on this prisoner
with a GI bleed.

01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:56.132
So, this guy is very sketchy

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:57.733
you know, and he's
kind of a leech

01:18:57.801 --> 01:18:59.435
but I don't wanna
seem like a wimp.

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:02.338
So, I close the door
to give him some privacy

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:04.573
and I pull on my glove,
lube up my finger

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.075
and go ahead with the exam.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:09.445
When I'm done, I go
to the door to leave

01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:10.746
and it's locked!

01:19:10.814 --> 01:19:12.415
It's a jail ward.

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.717
The doors don't open
from the inside.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:17.353
So, here I am, stuck
with creepy convict guy

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.589
who is now laughing,
pulling up his pants

01:19:20.656 --> 01:19:21.791
and asking me if it was

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.259
as good for me
as it was for him.

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:24.093
Oh, my God.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.328
Yeah, it took me ten minutes

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:26.462
of banging on that door

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:28.264
to finally get a nurse's
attention to let me out.

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:30.366
Guy in Exam two
is coughing red snappers.

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:31.534
Be sure and wear a mask.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.369
- What's a red snapper?
- TB.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.571
- Tuberculosis?
- Yep.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:36.940
My first week in the ER

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:38.341
I forgot Haleh's name

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:39.442
'and called her Nurse.'

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.477
As in "Nurse, can you
get me some more 4x4s?"

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:42.678
Ooh, bad idea.

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:43.847
Nurses hate being called Nurse.

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:45.949
- Why?
- 'Cause we actually have names.

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:47.616
Or because we know a lot
more than med students.

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:48.717
Yeah, more than the interns.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:49.853
And more than most doctors.

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.487
So, anyway

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:52.822
Haleh decides to punish me

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:55.291
by paging me for Tylenol
orders every 20 minutes.

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:57.293
I would have paged
you every ten.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.394
Every five.

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.229
(Tracy)
'My first year in med school'

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.765
'the dean comes into our very
first lecture and he says'

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:05.201
'"I want you to look to your
left and to your right."'

01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:07.336
'"A year from now, one
of you will be gone."'

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:10.506
Dean told us that old chestnut
when I was in med school, too.

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:11.841
Was it true?

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.143
No, but it scared
the hell out of us.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:17.046
I mean, as if we weren't
worried enough already.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:19.448
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Couldn't sleep.

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:22.151
'I just thought I'd come in
and catch up on some charts.'

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:25.754
Maybe check up on a baby in the
NICU I helped deliver yesterday.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.990
Where's Banfield?

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:28.391
Down in sutures
stitching up naked drunk

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:29.425
'and disorderly guy.'

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:30.626
Get her down here now.

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:31.694
What is it?

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.962
Explosion at a power substation

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:34.330
multiple burn and blast victims.

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:35.798
- Three minutes out.
- How many?

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:36.832
At least eight.

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.334
Chuny, clear the trauma rooms.

01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:40.303
Jerry, get the blood bank
to send all their O-neg

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:41.637
and Dawn,
make sure we have enough

01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:43.406
Morphine and rapid infusers.

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:44.673
Yippee-ki-yay.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.009
You wanna be an ER doc?

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.110
This is the fun part.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.478
[instrumental music]

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:54.984
Industrial explosion.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.154
[sirens wailing in the distance]

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.258
Dr. C.

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:25.281
[sirens wailing]

01:21:32.455 --> 01:21:34.123
Morris! Triage!

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.194
(male #3)
'55-year-old man
thrown 20 feet against a wall.'

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:40.229
Diffuse abdominal pain.
BP 80 palp.

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:42.631
Rigid abdomen, probably
spleen or liver. Tracy!

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:43.766
- 'Yeah?'
- Two of O-neg.

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.101
'Hold for the OR.'

01:21:48.771 --> 01:21:50.940
Open femur, good distal pulses.

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:52.208
I'll take this one. Chuny!

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:53.943
'Gram of Ancef, 100 of gent.'

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.811
Titrate Dilaudid and call Ortho.

01:21:55.878 --> 01:21:58.047
- Julia, you're up!
- 'Laverne!'

01:21:58.114 --> 01:21:59.348
- I got Bardelli's..
- Good!

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.284
Found him down in V-fib
on a high-power line.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:03.119
'Epi, Lidocaine, and ten shocks'

01:22:03.186 --> 01:22:04.220
'put him into asystole.'

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:06.089
- Trauma 2?
- No, Curtain 3.

01:22:06.155 --> 01:22:08.691
We have to hold trauma
for the ones we can save.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.093
27-year-old male.
Short of breath, pulse ox 82.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:11.260
Come on. Come on!

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:12.495
Decreased breath sounds
on the right.

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:14.097
- Okay, no facial burns.
- 'Pneumothorax.'

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:15.464
Okay, set up for a chest tube!

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:17.066
Arm was blown off
below the elbow.

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:19.468
- Intubated after ten of MS.
- Alright, Sam!

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:20.836
Anything to re-implant?

01:22:20.903 --> 01:22:22.938
- Bits and pieces.
- Go.

01:22:23.006 --> 01:22:25.641
- Dr. Carter?
- What? I'm sorry. What?

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:27.810
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.845
Just a little deja vu.

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:31.914
Carter, you working?

01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:33.316
- Absolutely.
- Come on!

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:36.885
Burns over 90% of his body.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:37.920
'Soot at the vocal chords.'

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:38.954
Three liters of Ringers.

01:22:39.022 --> 01:22:40.056
'Let's call the burn service.'

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:41.357
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:46.562
Dr. Greene.

01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:49.132
You coming?

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:51.567
[sirens wailing]

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:56.005
Tight wheezing
throughout the ride.

Pulse ox 88.
