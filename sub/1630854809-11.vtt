WEBVTT

00:00.783 --> 00:01.392
<i>Previously on "The Ark..."</i>

00:01.392 --> 00:04.395
You'’re coming with me,
Mr. Trust.

00:04.395 --> 00:07.094
Ark 15, please respond.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.834
They'’re launching a shuttle.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.141
Where'’s the DNA vault?

00:11.141 --> 00:13.665
It says that it'’s
a really venomous spider.
Why would they want that?

00:13.665 --> 00:16.668
The spider'’s venom is
the cure for Klampkins.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.018
It'’s a component of the cure.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.673
Now fly us to Ark 15.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.852
- Hi, Mother.
- Where is Marko
with the package?

00:26.852 --> 00:30.160
Marko didn'’t make it.
Neither did the package.
It'’s still on Ark 1.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.727
- Where did they go?
- Proxima B.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.034
Proxima B
is an eyeball planet.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.557
What does that mean,
an eyeball planet?

00:35.557 --> 00:37.820
The sun only hits
one segment of the planet.

00:37.820 --> 00:40.431
It'’s too hot there,
and too cold on the rest
to sustain human life.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.130
- But William has a solution.
- Go screw yourself, Evelyn.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.482
This is Lieutenant Garnet
of Ark 1.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.049
We have your spider DNA.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.659
<i>Send someone in your shuttle</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.226
<i>with the DNA
and we'’ll make a trade.</i>

00:52.226 --> 00:55.620
- I'’ll go with Cogner.
- The DNA.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.059
As soon as Dr. Rogers
confirms it'’s the right DNA,
open fire.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.277
- Did you make it in?
- I'’m in.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.887
<i>So she'’s on Ark 15?</i>

01:21.385 --> 01:23.126
Coast is clear for now.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.823
<i>Okay, so based
on what we'’re seeing</i>

01:24.823 --> 01:25.824
<i>on the outside of the ship,</i>

01:25.824 --> 01:26.825
you'’re going to want to

01:26.825 --> 01:28.392
make your way to the bow.

01:28.392 --> 01:29.872
And down to
the lower corridors.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.224
I still think you should try
and find Angus first.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.487
<i>Finding Angus
will be pointless</i>

01:36.487 --> 01:38.837
if they fire on Ark 1 and
we have no ship to return to.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.579
<i>If Ark 15'’s layout
is anything like ours,</i>

01:41.579 --> 01:45.409
<i>you'’re looking for
a secure room somewhere
between corridors 40 and 50.</i>

01:45.409 --> 01:46.541
And if it'’s nothing like ours?

01:46.541 --> 01:47.455
Improvise.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.857
Bull'’s-eye.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.610
Who the hell are you?

03:19.547 --> 03:21.984
I know all security personnel.
You don'’t look familiar.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.682
It'’s a big ark.
Lots of people to meet.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.598
- What'’s your name?
- Denise.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.861
I'’m on the Psy-Ops defense team.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.734
- And you are?
- There'’s no team like that.

03:35.084 --> 03:38.000
Gary? Was that you?

04:01.110 --> 04:02.981
Gary told me to come let you
know he'’s taking a break.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.984
How do I turn off this weapon?

04:05.984 --> 04:09.031
I'’m just a guard.
I don'’t know about the weapon.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.165
What is that crystal stuff
in those shells?

04:13.165 --> 04:14.732
Where did it come from?

04:14.732 --> 04:16.821
Miss Maddox invented it
before we launched.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.606
- So it'’s from Earth.
- Yeah.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.999
- What will neutralize it?
- That'’s why she invented it.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.262
Nothing can neutralize it.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.003
You know, you'’re
really no help at all.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.577
Ark 1, I'’m in,

04:33.577 --> 04:36.145
but I have no idea
what to do.

04:36.145 --> 04:40.236
Can you believe that these
itty bitty teeny tiny critters

04:40.236 --> 04:42.412
are gonna grow
into venomous arachnids

04:42.412 --> 04:45.110
that can cure a previously
incurable disease?

04:45.110 --> 04:50.028
I know. Couldn'’t the cure
to Klampkins have been
anything other than spiders?

04:50.028 --> 04:52.422
- You don'’t like spiders?
- You do?

04:52.422 --> 04:55.077
Love them.
I had a pet tarantula
when I was little.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.603
Oh, it'’s happening!

04:59.603 --> 05:02.040
Usually spiders usually take
two to three weeks to hatch,

05:02.040 --> 05:04.956
but we'’re doing it in hours.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.306
Oh, and look at them.
They'’re so cute.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.526
Cute is not the word
I would use.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.574
I wish Angus were here.

05:13.574 --> 05:18.056
He'’ll be okay.
Garnet will get him back.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.581
We don'’t know that.
We could lose her, too.

05:20.581 --> 05:23.279
- We can'’t think like that.
- It'’s literally all
I can think about,

05:23.279 --> 05:25.977
and I never got to
tell him how I feel.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.719
<i>Alicia to the bridge,
and be quick.</i>

05:34.682 --> 05:37.467
Is it weird
that none of these guards
have guns on them?

05:37.467 --> 05:39.339
<i>They'’re following
Ark safety protocols.</i>

05:39.339 --> 05:42.037
<i>Any gunfire on a space vessel
could be catastrophic.</i>

05:44.169 --> 05:46.824
Didn'’t stop them from using them
to board our ark.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.914
<i>Yeah, well,
they clearly didn'’t care about
the integrity of our ark.</i>

05:49.914 --> 05:52.700
They must take the weapons
out of secure holding
when facing threats.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.223
Or instigating them.

05:54.223 --> 05:58.140
Any ideas on how
to shut down this weapon?

05:58.140 --> 06:00.272
Can you dump
all the Aliciaminium?

06:00.272 --> 06:04.973
Uh, that would probably
destroy the ship.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.192
<i>It looks like the shells
containing the crystals</i>

06:07.192 --> 06:10.457
are sent into
the weapons chamber

06:10.457 --> 06:12.633
via delivery tubes.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.330
Can you destroy the tubes?

06:14.330 --> 06:16.941
<i>No tools.
So not quickly.</i>

06:16.941 --> 06:19.988
Wait, there'’s a control panel.
It needs a passcode to get in.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.731
Maybe we can hack the system
to get access and find
a weakness to exploit.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.037
Hate to break it to you, guys.
I am not a computer hacker.

06:26.037 --> 06:29.650
But I am.
I mean, I'’m not a hacker.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.303
I'’m just really good
at computers.

06:31.303 --> 06:34.219
I only do ethical hacking,
which this is, right?

06:34.219 --> 06:36.047
Just tell her
how to get in, Alicia.

06:36.047 --> 06:39.137
<i>Is there
any kind of model number</i>

06:39.137 --> 06:43.751
<i>or logo on the console,
or behind it maybe?</i>

06:43.751 --> 06:47.102
- Only Maddox Corp.
- Okay, so maybe it started
off as Trust tech.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.539
<i>Let'’s try to use Trust's
administrative backdoor.</i>

06:49.539 --> 06:52.107
<i>Power down the system
and restart it.</i>

06:52.107 --> 06:55.502
Okay, okay.

06:55.502 --> 06:58.243
Found it.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.469
- Done.
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:06.469 --> 07:07.514
<i>Once it starts booting up,</i>

07:07.514 --> 07:08.906
<i>you'’ll see a black screen.</i>

07:08.906 --> 07:13.650
<i>Type in
"command colon 2487TR12."</i>

07:13.650 --> 07:16.218
I think it worked.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.959
Looks like a bunch
of gibberish though.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.700
It'’s okay. It's code.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.441
So now you'’re
looking for a line

07:21.441 --> 07:24.400
that says something
like "schematics"
or "blueprints" or--

07:24.400 --> 07:27.359
- Framework?
- <i>That'’s it! Click it.</i>

07:27.359 --> 07:31.538
Whoa, there'’s hundreds of files
of design layouts here, guys.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.104
<i>I don'’t know
if I'’m gonna have enough time</i>

07:33.104 --> 07:34.410
<i>to go through all of this.</i>

07:34.410 --> 07:35.933
Hold your watch up
to the terminal.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.413
A signal should
pop up on screen

07:37.413 --> 07:38.240
<i>and ask if you want
to connect...</i>

07:41.243 --> 07:43.550
Done.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.813
Okay. And we'’re in.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.510
Well done. Perfect.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.251
I'’ll dig into
the weapon system from here,

07:49.251 --> 07:51.166
try to find a way to stop it.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.733
And it looks like it gave us
access to ship blueprints.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.125
They have a real brig.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.866
My guess is that'’s where

07:55.866 --> 07:57.346
<i>they'’re holding Angus
and the others.</i>

07:57.346 --> 07:58.782
And of course
it'’s inconveniently located

07:58.782 --> 08:01.089
in the most active sector
of the ship.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.569
I'’m on my way. Garnet out.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.936
If anyone is out there,
could you please let me out?

08:21.936 --> 08:23.851
Hello? Anyone there?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.290
Someone, plea--

08:34.252 --> 08:38.082
- Miss me?
- To be honest, not really.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.304
- I know you'’re mad at me.
- You kidnapped me.

08:42.304 --> 08:46.221
I saved you.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.614
Ark 1 isn'’t going to survive,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.267
so I brought you to Ark 15.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.965
You can have a future with us.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.228
You can accomplish things
you never would'’ve on Ark 1.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.273
I didn'’t ask for any of that!

08:55.273 --> 08:56.448
Well, some of
the best gifts in life

08:56.448 --> 08:57.711
are ones we don'’t ask for.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.236
Don'’t you have anything
you wanna say to me?

09:01.236 --> 09:02.672
No.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.198
Don'’t you want to apologize
for what you said about Mother?

09:12.639 --> 09:13.683
Uh...

09:16.033 --> 09:17.078
Yes.

09:20.777 --> 09:25.216
I'’m sorry.
I shouldn'’t have
said those things.

09:25.216 --> 09:29.264
I mean,
I don'’t even know her.

09:29.264 --> 09:34.138
For example, why does she have
a different accent than you?

09:41.537 --> 09:44.496
I was raised by my father
in North America

09:44.496 --> 09:48.109
until he died when I was 11.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.111
Then I had to live with Mother.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.593
You'’re actually kind
of just like her.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.336
I somehow doubt that.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.861
It'’s true.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.819
You'’re a brilliant scientist

10:02.819 --> 10:05.648
coming up with innovative ways
to make people'’s lives better.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.956
She'’s the same.
When the GSA fell,

10:08.956 --> 10:11.698
Mother kept the program going
and building more arks.

10:11.698 --> 10:15.266
There would'’ve
only been five arks
if it wasn'’t for her.

10:15.266 --> 10:19.183
Think about how many lives
she saved before we had to
leave Earth ourselves.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.797
She sounds important.
And busy.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.147
It must'’ve been hard for her
to make time for you
with a job like that.

10:26.147 --> 10:29.890
She was saving humanity.
How can I blame her for that?

10:29.890 --> 10:34.372
Oh, no, I just meant
it sounds intimidating.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.287
Hard to live up to
those kinds of expectations.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.639
I have an idea.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.857
Let'’s ask Mother
to have dinner with us.

10:43.512 --> 10:46.210
- Dinner?
- She has to get to know you.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.474
And what happens
if she doesn'’t like me?

10:49.474 --> 10:52.956
Let'’s cross that bridge
when we get there.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.437
Let'’s cross that bridge
when we get there.

11:11.409 --> 11:15.152
Hey! This room is restrict--

11:19.591 --> 11:21.463
What the...

11:47.010 --> 11:50.927
William,
have you come to your senses?

11:50.927 --> 11:55.105
I'’m offering you a chance
to complete your mission
to save the human race.

11:55.105 --> 12:00.241
All you need to do is agree
to help me rotate Proxima B.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.852
Then we can begin our future
on a new world.

12:02.852 --> 12:06.334
You don'’t fool me Evelyn.
No future of yours includes me.

12:06.334 --> 12:10.860
To survive on that planet,
we need you to share
your knowledge with us.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.688
If anyone'’s being selfish,
it'’s you.

12:14.821 --> 12:19.042
- Agree to disagree.
- So your answer is still no?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.957
You see? She is a genius.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.395
That'’s disappointing.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.311
Maybe Vuk
will be more persuasive.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.192
Whoa! Are you crazy?

12:38.192 --> 12:41.282
I care about our survival,

12:41.282 --> 12:44.502
even if William here doesn'’t.

12:44.502 --> 12:47.679
I'’ll come back to see
if you'’ve changed your mind

12:47.679 --> 12:49.638
or if you need more convincing.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.693
Let me see.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.565
I don'’t think
I'’m the kind of man
that could--

13:03.565 --> 13:06.307
what the--

13:06.307 --> 13:07.525
Maybe I should just
give her what she wants.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.179
You said she'’d kill you

13:09.179 --> 13:10.441
if you gave her what she wants.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.921
A quick and painless death
sounds better

13:11.921 --> 13:13.314
than hours of torture.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.882
Ark 1 will come back for us.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.100
They won'’t leave us behind.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.103
And you really believe that?

13:20.103 --> 13:21.626
I do.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.509
There'’s gotta be thousands
of spiders in here,

13:34.509 --> 13:38.556
<i>all different kinds
at various stages of growth.</i>

13:38.556 --> 13:41.124
Since they didn'’t have the
Mediterranean recluse spiders,

13:41.124 --> 13:42.996
Ark 15 must'’ve been trying
every other type they had

13:42.996 --> 13:44.824
<i>to see if any worked
for the Klampkins cure.</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:46.695
<i>My guess is
they didn'’t find a substitute,</i>

13:46.695 --> 13:49.176
<i>or we'’d probably
all be dead right now.</i>

13:49.176 --> 13:51.308
When will they realize
we gave them

13:51.308 --> 13:52.788
<i>the wrong spider DNA?</i>

13:52.788 --> 13:54.311
Well, I gave them
a brown recluse spider.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.965
It'’s nearly identical
to the Mediterranean.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.967
<i>They'’ll have to raise it
to full maturity</i>

13:57.967 --> 14:00.013
<i>and test the venom before
they realize what we did.</i>

14:00.013 --> 14:02.145
So how long until
the spiders are mature?

14:02.145 --> 14:04.800
<i>Well, if they'’re
in an acceleration
terrarium like ours...</i>

14:04.800 --> 14:08.673
- Looks that way.
- A couple hours at most.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.588
<i>So in that time,
you gotta track down Angus</i>

14:10.588 --> 14:13.417
- and figure out a way
off that ship.
- Oh, is that all?

14:13.417 --> 14:14.854
<i>Oh, wait a second.</i>

14:14.854 --> 14:16.072
<i>Can you see
what other elements</i>

14:16.072 --> 14:17.073
they'’re combining
with the venom

14:17.073 --> 14:18.727
to create the cure?

14:18.727 --> 14:20.207
Let me look.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.912
Do I have mustard on my face?

14:29.912 --> 14:31.218
It'’s your chance to be cured.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.350
Yeah, I wouldn'’t count on it.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.183
Angus built
an entire farm

14:40.183 --> 14:42.316
from scratch on Ark 1.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.840
He made vegetables from nothing.
Isn'’t that right, Angus?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.189
Well, not from nothing.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
I had seeds
and chemically modified--

14:47.843 --> 14:51.978
We have botanists
and agricultural experts here,

14:51.978 --> 14:55.198
- ones I trust.
- Sure, but Angus'’ expertise

14:55.198 --> 14:57.244
could be useful on Prox B.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.421
He'’s an expert
at adapting to new,
unexpected environments.

15:00.421 --> 15:03.598
- He'’s an outsider.
- He'’s my friend.

15:03.598 --> 15:07.428
- Is that all?
- What'’s that supposed to mean?

15:09.038 --> 15:11.345
Has Kelly ever told you
about what happened

15:11.345 --> 15:13.956
to her other friends
in the past?

15:13.956 --> 15:16.437
None of them last too long.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.231
I think--
I think I found it.

15:28.231 --> 15:31.800
Potassium aluminum sulfate
and formaldehyde.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.846
<i>Those are the two constants
on every vial.</i>

15:34.846 --> 15:37.327
Only the venom changes.

15:37.327 --> 15:42.115
<i>Looks like 0.5 milligrams and
0.25 milligrams respectively.</i>

15:42.115 --> 15:45.248
That'’s gotta be it.
That'’s how we make the cure.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.381
<i>Get on it with Kabir.</i>

15:52.603 --> 15:54.475
What'’s going on over there?

15:54.475 --> 15:57.695
Intruder alert.

15:57.695 --> 15:58.914
Can you guess who
the intruder might be?

16:06.269 --> 16:07.488
What did you do?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.533
Nothing. I couldn'’t have.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.144
Was this whole dinner
a distraction

16:11.144 --> 16:13.668
to keep me occupied
while some of your people

16:13.668 --> 16:15.887
attempt some kind
of rescue mission?

16:15.887 --> 16:19.935
He'’s telling the truth.
I haven'’t left his side
since he got here.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.633
And besides,
he wouldn'’t betray me.
She'’s right.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.113
I wouldn'’t help anyone
from Ark 1.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.941
- I'’m with Ark 15 now.
- Why?

16:28.857 --> 16:29.727
Because Kelly'’s on Ark 15.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.298
- We'’ll see about that.
- Mother, you'’re leaving?

16:35.298 --> 16:37.474
But you barely
touched your food.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.955
Our ship is being threatened.
I have a job to do.

16:39.955 --> 16:43.524
Can'’t your guards do it?
You promised we'’d have dinner.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.440
You sound like a child.
Grow up.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.312
And if I find out
this new boy of yours

16:49.312 --> 16:51.706
has any role
in this intrusion...

16:53.708 --> 16:56.015
...I'’ll have him
sent out the airlock.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.192
Mother?

17:05.154 --> 17:06.590
She'’s having a heart attack.
Call a doctor.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.377
Kelly, call med bay now!

17:16.426 --> 17:18.994
The intruder.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.953
Did we catch them?
I have to go help.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.608
Your team is conducting
a shipwide search.
You need to rest.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.049
You were a part of this.
I know it.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.354
Tell me what you know.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.748
Interrogation
is not rest, Evelyn.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.271
Besides, this young man
saved your life.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.190
Why did she have
a heart attack?

17:41.190 --> 17:44.585
Well, congestive heart failure
is a common symptom

17:44.585 --> 17:47.240
at late stage Klampkins,
and since we'’re--

17:47.240 --> 17:50.765
Klampkins?
What are you talking about?

17:52.636 --> 17:55.291
Why didn'’t you tell me
you had Klampkins?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.859
- I--
- No wonder you hate
Trust so much.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.208
I'’m sorry, I thought she knew.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.950
It didn'’t seem necessary

18:01.950 --> 18:04.213
to inform you
about my condition.

18:04.213 --> 18:07.912
It didn'’t seem necessary?
I'’m your daughter!

18:07.912 --> 18:11.568
How could you not tell me that?

18:11.568 --> 18:15.224
- How bad is it?
- Throughout our time
on this ship

18:15.224 --> 18:19.489
your mom'’s symptoms
have increased at
a nearly exponential rate.

18:19.489 --> 18:22.231
Space travel seems
to exacerbate the disease.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.929
Maybe it'’s the
artificially generated oxygen

18:24.929 --> 18:26.931
or the low level
cosmic radiation.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.108
We'’re not exactly sure why.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.676
So you'’re saying
she'’s been having
these attacks for a while?

18:32.676 --> 18:34.635
This was her third heart attack
in the last week.

18:34.635 --> 18:38.421
- Mother!
- We'’re doing everything
we can toward a cure,

18:38.421 --> 18:41.816
using the spider DNA
we received from Ark 1.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.861
If we can get that working soon,

18:43.861 --> 18:46.516
there'’s a good chance
for full recovery.

18:46.516 --> 18:49.128
You'’re lucky the boy
knew how to do CPR,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.694
or you'’d likely be dead now.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.832
You could have just let me die.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.273
Like I said,
I'’m loyal to you now.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.468
Let me into the brig

19:25.468 --> 19:27.862
or I'’ll find a really creative
place to use this.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.136
- Angus?
- I told you she'’d come.

19:41.136 --> 19:44.400
- Where'’s Angus?
- They split us up
when we got here.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.751
Kelly took Angus.
Thanks for coming back
for us, Garnet.

19:47.751 --> 19:50.406
I didn'’t come for you.
Angus is the only one that
deserves to be brought home.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.147
He didn'’t betray
our entire crew.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.279
So you'’re just gonna
leave us here?

19:53.279 --> 19:54.497
- Drop your weapon!
- Whoa!

19:57.500 --> 19:59.241
Easy.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.523
Did Helena make it?

20:20.523 --> 20:22.656
No.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.179
She bled out in Cat'’s arms.

20:25.963 --> 20:29.750
Did you even try to save her?
Did anyone?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.752
If you wanna blame someone,
blame yourself.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.363
You inspired a coup.
If you'’d listened to me,

20:34.363 --> 20:38.062
we'’d still be on our way
to Ross 128 and Helena
would still be alive.

20:47.594 --> 20:51.859
You were right.
About everything.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.733
- I'’m sorry.
- Bit late for that, isn'’t it?

20:56.733 --> 20:58.605
I wanna fix this, Sharon.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.435
I'’m not sure you can.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.666
You manage to figure out
anything with their weapon yet?

21:16.666 --> 21:19.408
Still working on it.

21:19.408 --> 21:23.151
If they caught Garnet,
the chances they
use it on us go way up.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.501
- You just had to say it,
didn'’t you?
- Try her again.

21:25.501 --> 21:26.763
We'’ve been trying
her for 30 minutes.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.591
She'’s probably
gone radio silent.

21:28.591 --> 21:31.072
Perhaps, but in the meantime,
what do we do?

21:34.815 --> 21:36.338
- What?
- She left you in charge.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.906
Look, just give her time, okay?

21:38.906 --> 21:41.038
She'’s been in
tough spots before,

21:41.038 --> 21:42.692
and she'’s always
come through.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.607
Yes, but we should prepare
for the worst.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.130
If Garnet is caught,
we'’ll need a plan,

21:46.130 --> 21:47.349
either to get
the hell away from here

21:47.349 --> 21:49.569
or negotiate with Maddox
on our own.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.745
Well, maybe we need to, uh,

21:51.745 --> 21:52.920
to charge the FTL, you know?

21:52.920 --> 21:55.314
Just-- just to be--

21:55.314 --> 21:57.098
just to be safe, you--

21:57.098 --> 21:59.056
Brice! Brice!

21:59.056 --> 22:01.276
Kabir to the bridge now.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.368
It'’s the Klampkins, isn't it?

22:06.368 --> 22:09.676
Excuse me. Out of my way!
Out of my way!

22:16.900 --> 22:18.728
- How long has he been out?
- Almost a minute.

22:23.167 --> 22:26.693
All right, his heart
sounds good, thank God.

22:26.693 --> 22:30.087
- So it'’s not a heart attack.
- Why-- why would it be?

22:30.087 --> 22:32.916
Because in the later
stages Klampkins,

22:32.916 --> 22:37.051
the patients usually
have a heart attack or
several before they, um--

22:37.051 --> 22:38.313
well, before it'’s over.

22:38.313 --> 22:41.490
But the longer
a Klampkins episode lasts,

22:41.490 --> 22:43.666
the closer
he'’s getting to end stage.

22:43.666 --> 22:47.061
- This was really long.
- What can we do?

22:47.061 --> 22:49.455
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?

22:49.455 --> 22:51.370
We just have to wait
for it to pass.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.765
It'’s the cruel reality
of the illness.

22:55.765 --> 22:59.769
- Okay, okay.
- You had us worried there, Lieutenant.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.075
We should get you to med bay,

23:01.075 --> 23:03.643
check your vitals,
and run some tests.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.732
I'’m fine.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.082
- Really, I'’m fine, I'm fine.
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

23:15.568 --> 23:18.048
How long until the spiders
are ready for venom extraction?

23:20.268 --> 23:24.533
A couple of hours maybe.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.927
- Does Lieutenant Brice
have that much time?
- I wish I knew.

23:26.927 --> 23:30.234
I wish the spiders
would grow faster.

23:30.234 --> 23:34.108
So do I, because
I don'’t know how many
more episodes he can endure

23:34.108 --> 23:36.763
before he has a heart attack
that could kill him.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.378
Go and listen in.

23:43.378 --> 23:44.684
I wanna know what
they'’re saying about me.

23:44.684 --> 23:47.643
I'’m sure they're saying
you'’ll be fine.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.516
Yeah, well,
I'’m willing to bet that
is exactly the opposite.

23:52.169 --> 23:56.739
Listen, Felix,
we need to talk.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.959
I need to know there'’s
someone ready to lead this crew

23:58.959 --> 24:00.917
if I become incapacitated.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.224
- Well, I suppose Eva could--
- I think it should be you.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.574
What? Me? Why me?
Why not Eva?

24:05.574 --> 24:07.402
She'’s on council and she knows
how the ship works.

24:07.402 --> 24:08.795
No.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.452
Eva took Trust'’s side.
She betrayed this crew.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.324
We need someone
like you, someone with
a strong moral compass.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.282
You'’re the most qualified
person on this ship.

24:18.282 --> 24:21.285
Well, you know, besides me.

24:21.285 --> 24:25.768
- Brice, I don'’t like this.
- And you think I do, pal?

24:25.768 --> 24:27.727
But, look,
if Garnet doesn'’t come back,

24:27.727 --> 24:29.250
and if I bite it, then...

24:31.165 --> 24:32.209
...we need to have a plan.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.614
I don'’t know how
I'’ll ever be able to
thank you for what you did.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.225
I'’ll try to think of something.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.360
You'’re gonna fit in
just right here.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.840
You already are.

24:55.581 --> 24:59.236
So you think dinner went well?

24:59.236 --> 25:02.892
Besides the whole
near death experience part?

25:02.892 --> 25:04.154
Better than well.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.596
But, Angus,

25:10.596 --> 25:11.988
when things start
to go my way,

25:11.988 --> 25:13.860
I get nervous.

25:13.860 --> 25:17.516
So I just don'’t want you
to forget one little thing.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.041
What'’s that?

25:21.041 --> 25:24.305
You saw what I did
to Helena Trust, right?

25:28.048 --> 25:32.052
If you betray me, it'’ll be
the last thing you ever do.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.538
Sleep tight, Angus.

26:01.777 --> 26:05.389
- I owe you an "I told you so."
- Do you?

26:05.389 --> 26:06.652
I was right about the cure.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.349
And more importantly,
you were wrong.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.133
Well, we don'’t know
if the cure works yet.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.700
And in case
you hadn'’t noticed,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.615
my prognosis isn'’t exactly
getting any better,

26:13.615 --> 26:15.791
so I wouldn'’t
get your hopes up.

26:15.791 --> 26:16.923
Why do you have
to be like that?

26:16.923 --> 26:19.273
- Like what?
- So negative.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.885
It'’s in my DNA.

26:22.885 --> 26:25.148
Brice, all evidence
says it'’ll work.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.675
Why do you even care?
We stopped being friends

26:29.675 --> 26:32.547
the second
you betrayed my trust.

26:32.547 --> 26:36.986
I already told you,
I did it because
I don'’t want you to die.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.554
- I like you, okay?
- Eva--

26:39.554 --> 26:40.860
And I don'’t like
a lot of people.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.601
I told you not to fall for me.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.821
Well, too late.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.285
You said it was an emergency?

27:15.285 --> 27:18.854
Yes. How are you?

27:18.854 --> 27:20.160
I'’ve been worried about you.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.204
You'’re worried about me?

27:21.204 --> 27:23.729
Well, I wanted to check on you

27:23.729 --> 27:25.121
after finding out
that Kelly lied

27:25.121 --> 27:26.906
about Robert
and your little girl.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.778
Tell me,
how are you feeling?

27:29.778 --> 27:31.650
You need to look up
a definition of emergency.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.392
Okay, fine! I lied.

27:35.392 --> 27:38.178
I just-- I had to see someone.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.180
I'’m going crazy here
under house arrest

27:40.180 --> 27:41.790
all alone with my thoughts.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.618
Well, some thinking
should do you good.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.360
Every time I close my eyes,
I see Helena dying on the floor.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.578
And every time I open my eyes,

27:47.578 --> 27:49.580
all I can think
about is William.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.759
I get so angry
and also worried.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.065
I don'’t know
what to do with myself.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.981
I need to talk to people.
It'’s who I am.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.462
I'’m not meant to be alone.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.508
You should'’ve thought of that
before you decided
to be a part of a mutiny.

28:04.508 --> 28:05.771
No.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.618
Breakfast.
You sleep well?

28:27.618 --> 28:29.011
Fine, I guess.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.929
I think I figured out
a way for you to thank me.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.235
Oh, yeah? What'’s that?

28:37.106 --> 28:38.586
I'’d like to see
the Ark 1 prisoners.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.545
Yeah, that'’s not
going to happen.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.463
I'’m starting to feel
comfortable here...

28:50.424 --> 28:52.034
...with you.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.645
You'’ve shown me what
a difference I can make here

28:54.645 --> 28:57.039
working with you
and your Mom.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.607
So then why would you want
to see your old friends?

28:59.607 --> 29:03.393
Maybe I can make Trust
and Lane see the difference

29:03.393 --> 29:05.308
they can make here, too.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.658
Wouldn'’t that help your mom?

29:07.658 --> 29:09.051
She needs Trust, doesn'’t she?

29:09.051 --> 29:10.444
She does.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.446
Think how happy
she'’ll be with you

29:12.446 --> 29:15.928
if I can get Trust to change
his mind and help her.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.757
I don'’t think it's a good idea.

29:25.415 --> 29:26.895
Now you'’re hurting
my feelings.

29:28.723 --> 29:29.724
How?

29:31.204 --> 29:32.771
I saved your mom'’s life,

29:32.771 --> 29:34.468
and you still don'’t trust me?

29:34.468 --> 29:36.122
No, of course I do.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.472
Then let'’s go change
Mr. Trust'’s mind

29:38.472 --> 29:39.690
for your mom.

29:40.822 --> 29:41.954
She'’ll be so proud of you.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.666
- Dr. Marsh.
- Evelyn.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.495
Tell me you have a report
on the cure.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.105
- I'’m afraid I do.
- Afraid?

30:04.541 --> 30:07.066
Ark 1 gave us the wrong DNA.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.416
The venom in this spider
won'’t work.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.548
And you only just
figured this out?

30:11.548 --> 30:13.072
It was a nearly
identical arachnid.

30:13.072 --> 30:14.769
There was no way of telling

30:14.769 --> 30:17.467
until the spider aged
and we extracted venom.

30:17.467 --> 30:21.384
They were buying time for their
pathetic attempt at a rescue.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.826
- Should we prepare
to fire the weapon?
- Of course not.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.351
They'’re holding spider DNA
hostage in their ship.

30:31.351 --> 30:36.922
We can'’t destroy them.
Not yet.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.314
They'’re not taking me seriously.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.624
It'’s time
to start killing hostages.

30:49.673 --> 30:54.287
Did you know that extracting
a spider'’s venom is actually
called milking it?

30:54.287 --> 30:56.637
Honestly?
I wish you hadn'’t told me.

30:58.465 --> 31:01.294
Spiders produce venom
when they'’re afraid.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.427
So to isolate it,
we need to administer

31:04.427 --> 31:07.691
a tiny non-lethal
electrical shock.

31:07.691 --> 31:10.869
And there it is.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.914
The key to unlocking
the Klampkins cure.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.742
Try to get enough
for several vials.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.183
What'’s this for?

31:21.183 --> 31:22.793
I'’m going to
take blood samples
so we can run tests

31:22.793 --> 31:24.404
with the finished medication,

31:24.404 --> 31:25.622
check for safety and efficacy.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.755
How long will the tests take?

31:27.755 --> 31:31.019
If we'’re thorough, we should
monitor the blood for 72 hours.

31:36.242 --> 31:40.028
- Just give it to me.
- We should really
run the tests.

31:40.028 --> 31:43.858
Look, for all we know,
I might be dead in 72 hours.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.816
And to be totally honest,
I'’m sick of waiting.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.470
So just give it to me.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.911
Well, this is it.
The hypothetical
Klampkins cure.

31:55.739 --> 31:56.610
Are you sure about this?

32:01.310 --> 32:03.225
Never been so sure
of anything in my life.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.993
How do we know if it'’s worked?

32:31.993 --> 32:34.691
We should see a change
in your blood composition.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.389
The idea is that
the injection

32:36.389 --> 32:38.086
attacks Klampkins
at a molecular level.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.393
If it works,
then there won'’t be any
left in your blood.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.785
Give it time to do its thing.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.310
I'’ll check your blood
in a few hours.

32:52.709 --> 32:55.712
- Something'’s happening?
- Dr. Kabir!

32:55.712 --> 32:56.844
What is happening?

32:58.672 --> 33:01.066
Dr. Kabir!

33:01.066 --> 33:04.939
- What--
- Well, do something!

33:06.201 --> 33:09.204
Come on! Do something!
Come on!

33:10.597 --> 33:12.468
Dr. Kabir! Dr. Kabir!

33:21.173 --> 33:22.652
Charge. Clear!

33:26.961 --> 33:28.745
Charge. Clear!

33:31.879 --> 33:34.360
Charge again. Clear!

33:46.546 --> 33:48.200
What happened?

33:48.200 --> 33:51.768
We don'’t know.
His heart just--

33:51.768 --> 33:53.161
Felix, could you
check his vitals?

33:55.337 --> 33:56.817
He'’s stable.

34:03.824 --> 34:07.045
Hey, hey.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.656
He didn'’t want us to wait.
I should'’ve said no.

34:09.656 --> 34:10.831
I should'’ve insisted.
I should'’ve--

34:10.831 --> 34:13.138
- Slow down.
- I could'’ve killed him.

34:13.138 --> 34:16.010
- Slow down.
- We don'’t know if
it was the injection

34:16.010 --> 34:18.882
- or the illness
that caused this.
- She'’s right.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.362
We just have to figure out
which one was it

34:20.362 --> 34:21.233
and find a way to fix it.

34:22.756 --> 34:24.932
Hey, you can do this.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.592
Wait, wait. Where are you going?
I might need your help.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.160
I'’ll be on the bridge.
Call me if you need me.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.118
- Eva, please come with me.
- But--

34:37.118 --> 34:40.034
There'’s nothing
you can do for him.
He'’s in good hands.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.601
He would want you to continue
working on Ark 15'’s weapon.

34:41.601 --> 34:42.471
Let'’s go.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.625
Lieutenant Brice
is incapacitated.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.888
He'’s in good hands, but until
Lieutenant Garnet returns,

35:07.888 --> 35:10.630
- he'’s left me in command.
- We haven'’t heard from her.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.197
- It'’s been a long time.
- Keep on trying.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.546
We'’re not leaving her behind.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.685
Eva, get back to work
on that weapon.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.695
My mother sent us to deliver
food for the prisoners.

35:32.695 --> 35:36.830
My orders were
nobody gets in,
nobody gets out.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.876
Okay, well, then you can be
the one to tell my mother that
you failed to follow orders.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.847
- What are you doing here?
- She came to rescue you.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.631
Not us, apparently.
Just you.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.459
He'’s fine. He's with me.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.723
You little brat.
You killed my wife.

36:00.723 --> 36:04.945
Give me one good reason
I shouldn'’t repay the favor
here and now.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.469
I don'’t think your plan
to get him to cooperate
is going to work.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.689
- Your plan?
- Oh, yeah, I thought

36:09.689 --> 36:11.125
I could convince you
to work with Maddox.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.780
This was a bad idea.

36:13.780 --> 36:14.650
Let'’s go.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.267
Oh, God.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.487
She threatened to kill me
if I betrayed her.
She'’s gonna come after me!

36:25.487 --> 36:27.097
You did the right thing.
Now let'’s get out of here.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.838
I should stay and give her
what she deserves right now.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.710
Listen,
you can either stay here
and get your revenge,

36:30.710 --> 36:32.494
or you can come with us
and maybe survive.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.192
Maddox will punish her
for letting us go anyway.

36:36.324 --> 36:39.327
Aw, man, it is just not
your lucky day.

36:46.943 --> 36:50.295
When the test results come in,
they'’ll tell me whether
or not I almost killed him.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.340
Whether or not
we almost killed him.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.821
I'’ve been helping
make that cure
every step of the way.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.736
But I'’m the doctor.

36:56.736 --> 36:58.738
I'’m the one who injected him
without running tests first.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.871
- I should know better.
- You did what he wanted.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.090
I think you'’re being
too hard on yourself.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.745
I can'’t look.

37:05.745 --> 37:06.920
I'’ll do it.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.446
It wasn'’t our fault.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.405
The injection didn'’t cause
his heart failure.

37:16.364 --> 37:19.498
- That'’s the good news.
- Wait, does that mean
there'’s bad news?

37:19.498 --> 37:23.241
From these results, it looks
like the injection had no effect
whatsoever on Brice'’s blood.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.808
It'’s still full
of the Klampkins toxin.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.985
His heart has congestion
consistent with
late-stage Klampkins.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.552
That'’s what caused the attack.

37:30.552 --> 37:35.035
So the cure didn'’t work at all?
What went wrong?

37:35.035 --> 37:39.213
I don'’t know, but if
we don'’t figure it out fast,
Brice might not make it.

38:03.063 --> 38:06.066
This is your fault isn'’t it?

38:06.066 --> 38:09.417
My prisoners are gone
because of whatever idiotic
decision you made.

38:11.724 --> 38:14.596
One failure after another.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.424
You can'’t do anything right.

38:18.426 --> 38:20.950
- I'’m sorry.
- Excuse me.

38:20.950 --> 38:24.127
I have to go
clean up your mess.

38:30.830 --> 38:33.180
We'’re almost
at the shuttle bay!

39:03.166 --> 39:05.473
Come on, come on.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.392
Ark 1, are you there?

39:13.742 --> 39:15.701
So glad to hear your voice, Lieutenant.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.877
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Just a little complication,

39:17.877 --> 39:19.357
but I'’ve got Angus
and a few extras.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.532
Extras?

39:20.532 --> 39:22.316
<i>Yeah, Lane and Trust.</i>

39:23.883 --> 39:25.667
You'’re bringing Trust
back here?

39:25.667 --> 39:27.713
Didn'’t seem right
leaving him behind.

39:27.713 --> 39:30.019
- Are we ready
to get out of here?
- Please.

39:30.019 --> 39:33.196
<i>Docking lock not disengaged.</i>

39:33.196 --> 39:34.894
Docking lock?
That'’s not how it works.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.505
We got a problem here, guys.
We can'’t seem to take off.

39:39.420 --> 39:43.119
Uh, it looks like Ark 15
has a different launch system.

39:43.119 --> 39:43.946
Well, what does that mean?

39:47.776 --> 39:50.649
Someone has to pull
a release lever.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.172
Okay, then where is that?

39:52.172 --> 39:55.523
<i>Um, it'’s not on the shuttle.</i>

39:55.523 --> 39:58.787
- Then where is it?
- In the airlock.
Outside the shuttle.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.790
- Someone has to stay behind.
- <i>I'’m afraid so.</i>

40:01.790 --> 40:04.314
Look, every guard on this ship
is on their way here.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.012
Evelyn wants
our head on a stake.

40:06.012 --> 40:08.536
If we'’re going to leave,
we have to go now.

40:08.536 --> 40:11.321
Garnet, Garnet.
Garnet, wait!

40:11.321 --> 40:13.367
Garnet, no. Listen.

40:16.370 --> 40:19.329
I'’ll stay.
You need to get back to Ark 1.

40:19.329 --> 40:22.158
I mean, the whole reason
you came was to rescue Angus,

40:22.158 --> 40:23.769
and we can'’t trust
Trust to do it.

40:27.207 --> 40:29.383
I can'’t guarantee I'll be able
to get back for you.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.385
- I know.
- You don'’t know what
Maddox will do to you

40:31.385 --> 40:33.126
- when she finds you.
- Look, are you trying
to talk me out

40:33.126 --> 40:34.127
of my heroic sacrifice?

40:36.172 --> 40:37.347
Because you can'’t
take that from me.

40:41.351 --> 40:42.570
You know how to fly
this thing, right?

40:42.570 --> 40:44.790
Not as good as you.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.487
But, yeah,
I completed my training.
I can get us back home.

40:49.490 --> 40:52.928
Hey, Spence, don'’t die.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.450
<i>Ark 1, we'’re on our way home.</i>

41:36.450 --> 41:38.408
Thank goodness.

41:41.629 --> 41:43.283
- They'’re locking
weapons on you.
- Don'’t worry.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.545
What do you mean, don'’t worry?

41:44.545 --> 41:45.633
That thing will
melt the shuttle like...

41:45.633 --> 41:46.504
Watch.

41:48.462 --> 41:50.159
Fire on that shuttle now.

41:59.255 --> 42:00.996
What the hell happened
to my weapon?

42:02.737 --> 42:04.652
Oh, my God, you did it.

42:04.652 --> 42:06.262
It took a while to figure out

42:06.262 --> 42:07.699
what I could change remotely
to stop it.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.483
So what did you change?

42:09.483 --> 42:11.093
The barrel has to open to space

42:11.093 --> 42:12.878
like an airlock when it shoots.

42:12.878 --> 42:16.098
I disabled its little hatch.

42:16.098 --> 42:20.842
And it backfired?
You are a genius.

42:20.842 --> 42:21.930
That'’s what I keep telling you.

42:34.421 --> 42:36.554
Go, go, go!
