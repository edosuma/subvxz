WEBVTT

00:14.910 --> 00:16.320
Hundreds of fans are coming out

00:16.320 --> 00:20.430
to celebrate fashion designer patricia
novak's new summer line,

00:20.500 --> 00:24.700
stars arriving in true south beach style from surf to turf.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.230
Stepping off the boat we have heiress Nikki Beck

00:28.230 --> 00:30.260
and her boyfriend Brandon Hess,

00:30.470 --> 00:32.130
of the band two minute mile.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.010
Nikki,nikki,over here.

00:33.010 --> 00:35.310
Show us that thousand watt smile,nikki.

00:38.570 --> 00:41.010
Hey guys,great to see you.

00:41.010 --> 00:43.420
Nikki,are you going to be working the catwalk today?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.380
You know it.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.310
And after the show,

00:46.310 --> 00:49.210
I'm throwing a party for a couple hundred of my dearest friends.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.990
And check out who's right on Nikki's tail.

00:52.990 --> 00:56.140
Manhattan's favorite socialite,april goodwin.

00:57.070 --> 00:59.140
April,april,over here.

01:06.740 --> 01:07.850
over here.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.850
Oh,they're kissing.

01:11.850 --> 01:12.160
Oh,wow.Look at that,they're kissing.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.360
Oh,my god.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.590
Look,her dress fell.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.470
So,look,come to my place.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.150
Bring your headshot,

01:46.150 --> 01:47.790
we'll talk about how I can make you a star.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.990
Nikki wants mojitos in blue glasses

01:49.990 --> 01:51.860
or I stop payment on your check.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.640
No,I use the same trainer.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.690
Guy is great,you should check him out.

01:54.690 --> 01:55.640
I'll give you his number.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.000
Oh,my god.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.160
What is she doing here?

02:08.380 --> 02:10.660
Hey,none of that.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.820
I can't be in this room.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.650
I need some air.

02:16.960 --> 02:17.580
Nikki.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.580
Alone.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.740
nikki? Nikki?

03:59.030 --> 03:59.700
so,that's nikki beck.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.860
Yes,quite the young celebrity.

04:04.490 --> 04:05.490
It looks like she was

04:05.490 --> 04:07.810
electrocuted in the middle of her own party.

04:07.930 --> 04:09.860
Well,she was famous for being famous.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.570
All eyes trained on her every move.

04:11.570 --> 04:14.210
All except... her last one.

04:15.200 --> 04:20.200
Season 04 Episode 23

05:10.150 --> 05:13.160
Electrocution by bathtub is always hard to call,horatio.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.400
Death comes from ventricular fibrillation.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.590
A heart attack.

05:17.590 --> 05:20.240
And no visible signs of trauma.

05:23.010 --> 05:25.110
Whoa. Wait a minute,

05:27.030 --> 05:28.910
Something in her throat.

05:32.230 --> 05:33.790
Looks like a pill.

05:33.790 --> 05:37.360
She didn't have time to digest it before she died.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.610
Alexx,get that to toxicology,please.

05:40.610 --> 05:42.120
No problem.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.800
Thank you.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.290
Unique murder weapon--tanning lamp.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.950
Uv fluorescent bulbs.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.220
Looks like they're all broken.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.160
Aren't these outlets supposed to trip in order to prevent an electrical shock?

06:05.780 --> 06:08.160
They did.Just not fast enough.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.610
Unfortunately,she had something working against her.

06:10.610 --> 06:12.920
Bath salts,when they're dispersed into the water,

06:12.920 --> 06:14.430
the particles get charged.

06:14.510 --> 06:16.590
So the salt conducted the electricity.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.640
oh,I got a hair.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.790
It's not nikki's color.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.530
Maybe it's her killer'S.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.250
Hey,guys,check this out.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.050
Some blistering on her skin.

06:44.050 --> 06:47.110
Concentrated around a pale linear mark.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.980
Isn't that normal for water electrocution?

06:49.980 --> 06:53.610
Yeah,shows where the water level was at time of death.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.790
How can she have a linear mark when she was wearing her robe?

07:04.790 --> 07:05.740
Exactly.

07:06.330 --> 07:09.250
This girl was re-dressed after she was electrocuted.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.100
Maybe a cover up?

07:12.640 --> 07:15.300
Well,let's ask the guy who's used to controlling nikki's image.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.320
Her manager.

07:17.850 --> 07:18.910
I did it.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.560
I put her robe back on.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.520
That doesn't look so good,chad.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.140
Re-dress screams cover-up.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.470
I didn't kill her.

07:25.470 --> 07:28.000
When I found nikki in the tub,she was already dead.

07:29.000 --> 07:29.760
Hey.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.450
You flaking on your own party?

07:36.640 --> 07:37.840
oh,my god,nikki.

07:41.950 --> 07:43.710
Nobody needed to see her that way.

07:43.710 --> 07:47.040
So you slipped back in the crowd,but you decided not to call 911?

07:47.690 --> 07:48.940
I know how it works.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.630
You call it in,suddenly you're like the prime suspect.

07:52.090 --> 07:54.920
You seem to be overly conscious of how things look,chad.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.290
I had a client once,

07:56.930 --> 07:59.340
his autopsy photos ended up on the internet.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.410
No such thing as a private death anymore.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.270
Looks like a pattern with you.

08:04.270 --> 08:05.900
Your clients passing away.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.600
Say what you will,but i'm not a murderer.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.180
I was only protecting nikki.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.770
-Hey. -Hi.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.600
Your mother ever tell you there's more to a woman than meets the eye?

08:27.810 --> 08:28.750
Nikki beck.

08:29.060 --> 08:31.260
Hair extensions,capped teeth...

08:31.260 --> 08:32.780
collagen in her lips.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.860
She also had a spray-on tan.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.720
Good eye.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.640
And you told me you might have nerve damage.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.420
Actually,you're right,I don'T.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.240
And I'm glad word didn't get around that I did.

08:49.490 --> 08:50.550
Why would it?

08:55.950 --> 08:57.100
Wait up.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.500
Were you testing me?

09:00.810 --> 09:02.590
To find out if i was the mole?

09:02.590 --> 09:04.050
This isn't easy for me.

09:04.050 --> 09:05.570
Ryan?

09:06.490 --> 09:09.370
Me? Of all people,me?

09:09.370 --> 09:10.770
Look,the lab is on the line.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.680
Horatio told me it was the only way.

09:15.010 --> 09:16.310
Alexx,I'm sorry.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.760
I just found out that nikki used a spray-on tan.

09:35.980 --> 09:38.760
So a tanning lamp doesn't make a lot of sense.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.760
Maybe,uh,maybe it was a plant.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.440
Someone brought it to make it look like an accident?

09:42.440 --> 09:44.980
Well,if so,I may have the very person who did it.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.220
Check out the hair you found at the scene.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.550
Yeah,the medulla's thick.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.440
It's greater than half the shaft,

09:53.440 --> 09:54.530
so it's not human.

09:54.530 --> 09:55.970
It's animal hair.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.340
And one with a very unique substance on its coat.

09:59.810 --> 10:00.920
Lauryl glucoside.

10:02.520 --> 10:06.030
And is that rosemary oil and grapefruit extract?

10:06.030 --> 10:07.920
It's organic flea shampoo.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.920
For those who can afford the very best.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.490
But whose dog barely ever touches the ground.

10:16.050 --> 10:16.850
No way.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.290
You think I killed nikki?

10:18.840 --> 10:21.100
So that's not your tanning lamp,miss goodwin?

10:21.100 --> 10:22.010
Please.

10:22.010 --> 10:23.510
I prefer the actual sun.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.380
We found a dog hair next to the bathtub where nikki was murdered.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.490
I have a warrant to extract hair from your dog to make a comparison.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.520
babydoll doesn't like strangers.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.450
Fine,I was trying to help nikki.

10:40.450 --> 10:42.620
I wasn't aware the two of you were that close.

10:42.970 --> 10:44.160
We were "frenemies."

10:44.160 --> 10:45.490
"Frenemies"?

10:45.490 --> 10:47.960
Friends in real life,enemies in the press.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.140
We just played their game,gave them what they wanted.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.550
What exactly were you trying to help her with?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.760
Nikki just got out of rehab.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.100
And she couldn't deal.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.340
Hi.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.940
Did anyone see you?

11:05.620 --> 11:06.690
We're cool.

11:06.690 --> 11:10.470
Oh,my god,your wardrobe malfunction idea was the best.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.110
What's wrong?

11:17.520 --> 11:18.750
Give it here.

11:20.610 --> 11:22.950
I put you in rehab and I can put you right back.

11:24.130 --> 11:27.160
All right,take it.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.150
It's interesting that you would say that,

11:29.150 --> 11:31.520
because our medical examiner found a pill in her throat.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.710
I swear,I took the pill away from her.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.800
Then how would she get another one right before she died?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.730
That bitch.

11:38.730 --> 11:39.750
Who are you referring to?

11:39.750 --> 11:42.360
Her assistant,melinda carson.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.100
April's lying.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.410
I did everything nikki wanted,

11:45.410 --> 11:47.280
but I drew the line at drugs.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.240
Then where'd she get them?

11:49.550 --> 11:50.510
Are you kidding?

11:50.670 --> 11:53.500
Drugs are exchanged at these parties more than phone numbers.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.900
I take it nikki didn't know about your past.

11:56.630 --> 11:57.750
My past?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.460
You were arrested for identity theft three years ago on your last job.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.500
That was a misunderstanding.

12:04.010 --> 12:06.940
I can't get anything done unless I pretend to be the person I'm working for.

12:07.370 --> 12:08.420
I do her banking.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.900
Buy her airline tickets.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.340
Is there any chance that nikki found out

12:11.340 --> 12:13.890
you were using her identity and things got out of control?

12:15.440 --> 12:16.540
That's just great.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.620
Now you're accusing me of murder,too.

12:20.930 --> 12:22.720
Unless you'd like to substantiate that with any proof,

12:22.720 --> 12:25.070
I have a funeral to arrange.

12:32.030 --> 12:35.080
Eric,there's something I wanted to talk to you about.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.450
Marisol.

12:37.450 --> 12:38.230
Is she okay?

12:38.230 --> 12:40.970
She's fine; she and i are getting married today.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.550
We don't have the luxury of time,eric,

12:45.650 --> 12:47.850
and it would make her happy.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.980
The other thing that would make her happy is for you to be there.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.740
I don't know.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.800
I understand.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.070
But,eric,it would mean a lot.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.060
Yeah.

13:06.590 --> 13:08.240
I'll think about it.

13:08.890 --> 13:11.450
H,the pill from nikki's throat had a word stamped on it.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.890
Her saliva deteriorated a portion of it.

13:18.270 --> 13:20.950
Ghost-- is that a street term?

13:21.640 --> 13:22.530
Didn't sound familiar,

13:22.530 --> 13:24.780
so I scraped a sample,ran it through tox.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.960
What'd you find?

13:27.270 --> 13:28.150
It's a designer drug,

13:28.150 --> 13:29.730
knockoff of ecstasy.

13:29.730 --> 13:32.530
So new,it's not even on the government's controlled substance list.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.370
And one of the ingredients is ephedrine,

13:34.370 --> 13:35.320
used in cold medicine.

13:35.420 --> 13:39.240
Yes,but it is also used in the production of methamphetamine,isn't it?

13:39.340 --> 13:42.020
Whoever was going to manufacture this was going to need to buy a lot of it.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.540
And also going to need an I.D.To purchase it.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.760
That's right,I'll run it through narco,

13:45.760 --> 13:47.580
see if we get any red flags; I'll let you know.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.000
Let's do that.

13:57.190 --> 13:59.400
EPHEDRINE

14:01.180 --> 14:02.600
COLIN DANVILLE

14:02.600 --> 14:04.950
DADE UNIVERSITY DEPT OF CHEMISTRY 1108 BRIGHTON AVENUE MIAMI,FL 33011

14:12.610 --> 14:13.770
professor danville.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.860
We're here to investigate the murder of nikki beck.

14:17.140 --> 14:18.910
Well,how does this concern me,officer?

14:18.910 --> 14:21.780
You created the pill that we found lodged in her throat.

14:23.110 --> 14:25.480
Our narcotics division is aware of your website.

14:25.850 --> 14:27.910
Yes,I set it up to post my research.

14:28.010 --> 14:29.930
I have a grant to create drugs.

14:29.960 --> 14:30.910
Is that so?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.720
I just test formulas,

14:32.720 --> 14:35.240
I don't make drugs,or distribute them.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.020
Then why did you recently purchase a large

14:37.020 --> 14:39.200
quantity of ephedrine from surfglide pharmacy?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.220
It's part of my work,buy it all the time.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.910
But this last batch was stolen.

14:43.910 --> 14:45.080
And you didn't report it.

14:45.810 --> 14:47.030
Where did you keep the batch?

14:47.540 --> 14:49.570
Well,it was in the filing cabinet,top drawer.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.630
Wait a minute,don't touch that.

14:55.550 --> 14:57.070
The ephedrine was right there.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.420
Yeah,you use toothpicks?

15:06.420 --> 15:07.760
No. Why?

15:07.760 --> 15:09.120
Well,someone does.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.340
Eric,get that to the lab.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.020
I hear congratulations are in order.

15:25.970 --> 15:27.600
Listen,I wanted to tell you.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.720
I was just afraid of how you'd react.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.920
How did mami and papi take it?

15:35.550 --> 15:36.670
You didn't even tell them?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.130
This is exactly why.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.900
I knew they'd react the same way you are.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.130
Look,mari,you should be concentrating on getting better right now.

15:43.130 --> 15:45.150
Why do you always focus on the negative?

15:45.610 --> 15:47.080
That's one of the things i love about horatio.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.100
He makes me think about the positive.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.620
You barely know him.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.310
No,you barely know him.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.520
He is not the same man you see at work.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.860
Don't you think it'd be wise to slow down right now?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.620
I want to have a life like everybody else.

16:03.940 --> 16:05.550
What if the cancer comes back?

16:05.650 --> 16:07.110
What if it doesn't?

16:09.630 --> 16:11.280
I need to start living for the future.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.190
Until horatio,I didn't know if I had one.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.280
So you'll be at the ceremony?

16:25.500 --> 16:26.840
I'm sorry.

16:47.690 --> 16:48.260
hey.

16:49.010 --> 16:49.840
Hi.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.520
Are you looking for the toothpick results?

16:52.520 --> 16:54.800
Yeah,valera was supposed to have something for me.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.290
She was kind of swamped,so I told her i'd jump in and help you out.

16:57.730 --> 16:58.700
Okay.

17:00.740 --> 17:01.960
Is everything okay?

17:02.950 --> 17:04.440
Yeah,fine.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.089
I mean,I know we didn't spend that much time together,

17:07.089 --> 17:10.200
but enough to know when something's bothering you.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.319
I'm just dealing with some personal things.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.130
I'll,um... I'll work it out.

17:16.540 --> 17:17.510
Thank you.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.109
So,uh,what's the word on the toothpick?

17:20.109 --> 17:24.790
Oh,uh,yeah,I extracted enough dna for a profile and codis found a match.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.130
You want to check out your donor?

17:29.490 --> 17:31.020
Dario sanez.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.260
Think that's your drug dealer?

17:32.260 --> 17:34.030
Well,if he's not,he's definitely cooking it.

17:34.770 --> 17:35.840
Thanks.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.860
miami-dade P.D.

17:57.570 --> 17:58.940
Did you just see that,eric?

17:59.910 --> 18:02.800
okay. Dario sanez!

18:04.410 --> 18:06.310
Dario!Officer.

18:36.650 --> 18:37.640
check the house,eric.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.580
Check the house.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.450
There's somebody back there.

18:59.210 --> 19:00.380
policia?

19:01.010 --> 19:02.930
Please,help us.

19:04.930 --> 19:06.630
What's your name,ma'am?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.560
Isabella.

19:08.970 --> 19:11.300
Isabella,were you making drugs in that house?

19:12.450 --> 19:14.480
Yes,we worked for him.

19:15.740 --> 19:17.110
We were prisoners.

19:17.110 --> 19:18.680
So you lived in there?

19:21.130 --> 19:22.800
Where are you from,ma'am?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.210
El salvador.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.380
These men... they come.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.360
They take women in the middle of the night.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.360
Is that what happened to you?

19:32.160 --> 19:33.650
No,I let them take me.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.500
You let them take you? Why?

19:36.950 --> 19:38.750
They have my sister.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.210
These women,they don't last long.

19:41.550 --> 19:42.930
And she's already sick.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.660
What's your sister's name?

19:53.350 --> 19:54.390
Lucia.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.220
I hope I'm not too late.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.770
Please find her.

20:01.770 --> 20:03.270
I'm going to do my best.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.560
Hey,joey,you paged me?

20:13.860 --> 20:14.720
Yeah.

20:15.490 --> 20:17.640
Um,I thought there were no prints on the murder weapon.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.160
That's a first for me...

20:19.160 --> 20:21.050
a tanning lamp used as a murder weapon.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.950
I was about to ship the tanning lamp off to the evidence locker when my uv light hit it.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.410
There,on the back.

20:33.170 --> 20:34.530
See those tiny dots?

20:36.210 --> 20:37.500
Oh,yeah.

20:37.940 --> 20:38.940
What are they?

20:38.940 --> 20:40.800
You're looking at a datadot.

20:44.630 --> 20:46.410
Like a name tag,but with numbers.

20:46.690 --> 20:49.640
Company that makes them assigns a unique pin number to each registered owner.

20:50.830 --> 20:54.000
The dots are applied with a liquid adhesive containing a uv trace.

20:57.910 --> 20:59.130
So how do they help us?

20:59.130 --> 21:01.420
I traced the owner through the company's home page,

21:01.420 --> 21:02.420
and guess what?

21:03.880 --> 21:05.350
Registered to brandon hess.

21:06.270 --> 21:07.830
Nikki beck's boyfriend.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.900
Joseph,you just confirmed my theory.

21:11.090 --> 21:12.690
This didn't belong to her.

21:27.610 --> 21:29.240
Looks like they've been joined by grief.

21:29.690 --> 21:31.650
Yeah,at the hip.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.280
Oh,look--you brought a friend this time.

21:51.330 --> 21:53.050
Hey,I meant to ask you,who are you wearing?

21:53.490 --> 21:54.890
Mdpd.

21:55.650 --> 21:56.890
I'll have to google them.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.870
I'm glad to see you're helping each other through this.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.040
This is hard on all of us.

22:02.300 --> 22:03.980
But we totally have each other's backs.

22:04.420 --> 22:05.820
And fronts,apparently.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.970
April,you're gonna have to give us a second while we ask brandon a few questions.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.780
So buzzkill.

22:12.590 --> 22:14.190
Ring me at home,bran.

22:35.590 --> 22:36.600
see ya.

22:37.810 --> 22:38.740
So,what's up?

22:38.990 --> 22:41.030
How would you describe your relationship with nikki?

22:42.380 --> 22:43.680
Great girl.

22:44.050 --> 22:45.390
Our time together was hot.

22:45.390 --> 22:47.350
And she was there for me when...

22:48.040 --> 22:49.890
two minute mile was breaking up.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.610
My group. Two minute mile?

22:54.610 --> 22:56.530
Sorry,boy bands aren't really my thing.

22:57.350 --> 22:59.090
We've sold 28 million copies.

23:02.620 --> 23:03.770
whatever.

23:03.770 --> 23:04.910
I'm going solo.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.040
Why are you asking me about all this?

23:07.040 --> 23:09.890
Because it was your tanning lamp that was used to electrocute nikki.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.170
My tanning lamp?

23:11.450 --> 23:13.600
Datadots confirm that it's yours,brandon.

23:13.900 --> 23:17.170
Yeah. My accountants tagged all my stuff with those,for insurance.

23:17.510 --> 23:18.950
Then how did it end up at nikki's?

23:19.080 --> 23:19.970
I don't know.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.950
We used to borrow each other's stuff all the time.

23:22.630 --> 23:23.660
Can I go?

23:24.450 --> 23:25.440
For now.

23:31.980 --> 23:33.460
we don't have enough to hold him.

23:33.940 --> 23:36.990
We need to go back to the one thing we do have:The murder weapon.

23:37.270 --> 23:38.930
Yeah.

23:45.850 --> 23:48.700
Eric... you okay?

23:50.330 --> 23:54.160
Yeah. I'm just...thinking about this woman,isabella.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.410
Hard to see a woman take chances with her life like that,

23:57.410 --> 23:58.980
not knowing what the future is.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.850
It's a good thing she has people that care about her.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.540
Yeah.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.450
Anything off the word on that pill?

24:06.450 --> 24:07.330
No.

24:07.330 --> 24:08.800
Think that's the guy's nickname?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.040
The dealer?

24:10.040 --> 24:12.240
Maybe it's a way to contact him.

24:12.730 --> 24:16.300
OKay. Well,even if the letters correspond to numbers,

24:16.600 --> 24:19.090
"ghost" is only five digits,not enough for a phone number.

24:20.410 --> 24:22.210
But it is enough for a short code.

24:22.570 --> 24:24.080
What about a text message?

24:24.570 --> 24:28.240
Hey,punch in the specified five-digit code and you get an automated response.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.710
Why don't we place our own order?

24:32.040 --> 24:33.410
Let's give it a shot.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.400
we got him.3rd and palm.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.310
There you go.Call narco,have him picked up.

24:59.580 --> 25:00.800
Mr. Cervantes,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.650
you've done quite well for yourself.

25:05.470 --> 25:08.370
You think my business will shut down just 'cause you got me in here?

25:09.430 --> 25:11.190
I got a diversified corporation.

25:11.190 --> 25:12.610
And multinational.

25:12.610 --> 25:17.480
You kidnap young woman from el salvador and get them to work for you as slaves.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.130
You kidding me?

25:20.780 --> 25:21.790
They want to come.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.500
Work a few years,pay off some debts.

25:25.620 --> 25:26.590
Then they're free to go.

25:26.590 --> 25:29.850
After their bodies are destroyed by the poison you have them working in.

25:30.490 --> 25:32.990
You have to think outside the box to stay ahead.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.090
If I don't find lucia,my friend,I'm going to put you in a box.

25:36.090 --> 25:37.380
Do you understand me?

25:38.390 --> 25:41.900
Like I said,I got a corporation to run.

25:42.330 --> 25:44.190
I don't sweat personnel changes.

25:44.190 --> 25:45.530
Who handles that for you?

25:45.530 --> 25:47.190
Talk to middle management.

25:47.290 --> 25:48.440
I don't know a thing.

25:48.980 --> 25:54.330
After i find lucia,I'm going to shut down your corporation forever.

25:54.750 --> 25:55.910
Officer.

26:18.430 --> 26:19.200
hey.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.610
Let me ask you something.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.300
Do you have any plans after work tonight?

26:23.770 --> 26:25.240
Yes,I heard about the wedding.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.890
No,I'm not going.

26:27.370 --> 26:28.590
I'm really happy for them.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.560
Don't you think we should do something for them?

26:32.500 --> 26:34.480
Well,they said they didn't want to make a fuss,

26:34.480 --> 26:36.010
but I got them something anyway.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.310
Would you do me a favor?

26:38.350 --> 26:40.230
Would you put my name on the card?

26:40.650 --> 26:41.820
I already put your name on the card.

26:41.820 --> 26:42.990
-You did? -Yes.

26:42.990 --> 26:44.140
Thank you so much.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.410
You're fantastic.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.680
so,what do we got going on here?

26:48.980 --> 26:52.860
A partial print showed up on the bottom of one of the bulbs when kayle was processing the lamp.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.680
But there's not enough ridge detail to match it to a ten-card.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.950
No. I thought if I pulled enough partials,

26:57.950 --> 26:59.510
I'd be able to frankenstein a print.

27:00.170 --> 27:01.250
That could take forever.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.370
How are you at poker?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.170
What,you want to bluff?

27:08.120 --> 27:09.530
Who do you have in mind?

27:09.530 --> 27:10.930
April goodwin.

27:11.660 --> 27:13.160
Frank ran the background on her.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.770
It turns out she has a secret of her own--

27:14.770 --> 27:16.270
the goodwin family's broke.

27:16.270 --> 27:17.440
Really?

27:17.440 --> 27:19.920
Well,I just spoke to nikki's assistant,melinda.

27:20.990 --> 27:24.150
I wonder if april knew about nikki's deal to do a reality show without her.

27:24.660 --> 27:25.680
Reality show?

27:26.310 --> 27:27.730
It was supposed to be together,

27:27.940 --> 27:29.510
but nikki didn't want to share the spotlight.

27:29.510 --> 27:30.850
I'd call that motive.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.660
What?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.240
Am I supposed to guess what this is?

27:38.740 --> 27:42.170
It's your fingerprint off a bulb from the tanning lamp that killed nikki.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.420
You know,for someone in your position,april,

27:45.110 --> 27:46.630
lying doesn't look so good.

27:46.630 --> 27:48.360
I'm in a "position"?

27:48.740 --> 27:50.310
You were the last person to see nikki alive.

27:50.310 --> 27:51.620
Your fingerprint is on the murder weapon,

27:51.620 --> 27:53.270
which you said you had never seen.

27:53.270 --> 27:54.520
Of course I lied.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.900
You kept calling it a weapon.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.650
It was just a gift.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.690
You gave it to brandon?

27:59.690 --> 28:01.300
I always give gifts to my friends.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.210
I just sent nikk flowers for her party today.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.400
I have nothing to hide.

28:06.570 --> 28:08.500
Except for your family's financial situation.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.710
We did some research on you.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.140
Are the goodwins millions of dollars in debt?

28:13.460 --> 28:16.100
Didn't your father just apply for a real estate license?

28:17.290 --> 28:18.110
He's trying.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.840
That makes you the sole breadwinner for your entire family.

28:22.940 --> 28:25.930
How would you like to carry that name and not have a dime behind it?

28:26.890 --> 28:30.300
I'll do whatever it takes to support my family.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.110
Including kill nikki?

28:33.160 --> 28:36.920
How'd you feel when you found out that nikki was dropping you to do her own reality show?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.720
What are you talking about?

28:41.380 --> 28:42.560
No way.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.420
It was supposed to be about both of us.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.050
She was going to dump me?

28:53.550 --> 28:55.030
You saying you didn't know?

28:56.820 --> 28:58.250
I didn'T.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.730
You guys want me,I'll be on my boat.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.140
I can see myself out.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.040
She's a pretty good actress.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.200
She's not that good.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.190
She only does reality tv.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.640
I believe her.

29:21.870 --> 29:23.260
Well,if you're right,

29:24.410 --> 29:26.650
then we still don't know who nikki's killer is.

29:31.390 --> 29:35.800
Horatio,I called in a few favors over at narco.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.240
Asked for any houses they suspected of cooking meth.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.350
How many were there?

29:39.350 --> 29:43.600
22. Average house uses 1,250 kilowatt hours a month.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Cook houses,over three times that.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.570
What about the place we just hit?

29:47.840 --> 29:49.250
3,900 kilowatts.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.870
Okay. Same dealer,same equipment.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.770
Which house had the same amount?

29:52.770 --> 29:54.690
Here,this one.Just over 4,000.

29:55.820 --> 29:57.230
It's over near higgins park.

29:57.340 --> 29:58.530
That's a quiet neighborhood.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.920
Not for long.

30:08.020 --> 30:09.100
excuse me.

30:11.830 --> 30:14.070
Put the gun down slowly.

30:14.690 --> 30:17.420
You're under arrest for the manufacture of illegal drugs.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.120
Are you alone?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.520
Yeah,man.Just me.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.510
Check the van,eric.

30:37.310 --> 30:38.390
Okay. Calmate,okay?

30:38.390 --> 30:39.170
Todo esta bien.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.910
Estamos aqui para ayudarlas.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.700
Conocen a una muchacha que se llama lucia?

30:43.980 --> 30:45.900
No le hacimos vio por varios dias.

30:46.180 --> 30:47.180
She's not here.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.640
Where's lucia?

30:49.380 --> 30:50.860
Don't know no lucia,man.

30:51.410 --> 30:53.230
Let me jog your memory,my friend.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.510
Lucia.

30:55.510 --> 30:56.630
Oh,her?

30:57.150 --> 30:58.450
I got rid of her,man.

30:58.450 --> 30:59.990
She was useless.

31:00.370 --> 31:02.080
She kept fainting from the fumes.

31:02.730 --> 31:03.670
I sold her.

31:03.670 --> 31:04.600
To who?

31:04.600 --> 31:06.010
I don't know.

31:07.870 --> 31:09.570
Check the bag.The cash is in there.

31:14.930 --> 31:16.290
Here it is.

31:16.450 --> 31:18.270
I'm going to process it to see what I can get off it.

31:19.820 --> 31:21.050
Cuff him.

31:35.690 --> 31:36.710
I mean,we've been through everything.

31:36.710 --> 31:38.200
What are we missing?

31:39.240 --> 31:40.420
Look at this picture.

31:43.470 --> 31:45.010
Yeah. This is nikki's bathroom.

31:45.810 --> 31:46.670
What am I looking at?

31:46.670 --> 31:47.280
The flowers.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.780
Oh,yeah.April said she had them delivered to the party.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.820
Exactly. Flowers don't wilt that fast.

31:56.070 --> 31:57.560
Unless they were in high humidity.

31:58.310 --> 32:01.060
When nikki's body was found,the hot water had steamed up the room.

32:01.750 --> 32:04.120
By the time we got there,the moisture had evaporated.

32:04.260 --> 32:06.250
We didn't miss something.We just couldn't see it.

32:09.910 --> 32:11.460
So what exactly are we looking for?

32:12.650 --> 32:14.540
Anything the moisture isn't sticking to.

32:14.540 --> 32:18.490
Footprints,handprints.When you see something,just circle it with the chalk.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.150
So if someone walked in here while it was humid,

32:21.330 --> 32:23.330
their footprints would appear under new moisture.

32:23.330 --> 32:24.260
The outlines will.

32:24.650 --> 32:28.030
It's like if you take your finger and draw it across a window and then you breathe on it.

32:28.270 --> 32:30.700
Moisture can't stick to the grime left behind,

32:30.880 --> 32:33.480
and so you only see the mark when everything around it is wet.

32:37.350 --> 32:41.760
Okay,so most of the prints around the tub were wiped out by the water and crime scene activity.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.040
I got some bare feet prints here.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.060
Probably nikki'S.

32:46.060 --> 32:47.880
These are male shoe prints.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.150
They go from the tub out the door.

32:52.230 --> 32:54.340
Well,that covers nikki's manager's story,right?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.920
He came in here,re-dressed her...

32:57.160 --> 33:00.330
And these high heels would back april's story.

33:00.330 --> 33:02.940
She came to the tub,took the pill from nikki.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.750
Then whose footprints are these?

33:06.510 --> 33:07.780
Look like a woman'S.

33:09.140 --> 33:10.080
Flat soles.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.900
Sensible shoes.

33:12.930 --> 33:14.660
Someone working the party.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.890
Melinda,her assistant.

33:17.890 --> 33:19.910
She claims she never came in here.

33:20.580 --> 33:21.920
These come from the door.

33:23.260 --> 33:24.710
They go to the tub.

33:24.710 --> 33:26.910
And then they go from the tub to the vanity.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.360
That's where the tanning lamp was.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.880
These footprints are spread apart,like she braced herself.

33:52.310 --> 33:54.100
if this is melinda's handprint,

33:54.420 --> 33:55.810
she could have thrown in the lamp,

33:57.770 --> 33:59.470
and fell back when nikki splashed her.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.110
But that only suggests she was in the room.

34:01.110 --> 34:03.020
It doesn't prove she killed nikki.

34:03.180 --> 34:04.990
No.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.010
But I know what will.

34:07.010 --> 34:09.409
Melinda's been lying to us all along.

34:12.219 --> 34:14.580
I didn't tell you because i didn't want nikki to look bad.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.860
So now you admit you were there.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.550
Nikki wanted a fix.

34:18.550 --> 34:20.520
What nikki wants,nikki gets.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.469
So all that rehab was a waste.

34:23.469 --> 34:25.139
Just give me the damn pill.

34:27.300 --> 34:30.260
I left her in that tub,flying high.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.040
Actually,that's not true.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.000
I just got off the phone with nikki's manager.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.670
Turns out,she was gonna drop you out of her reality show,

34:36.670 --> 34:38.909
not april,like you told us.

34:39.330 --> 34:40.270
That's true.

34:42.150 --> 34:45.830
Mel,I got some news about the show.

34:46.030 --> 34:47.350
It's the network.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.389
They don't think you're right for the demo.

34:49.389 --> 34:50.820
Nikki.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.719
You promised me i could play myself.

34:53.040 --> 34:53.750
Sorry.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.550
At least you still have this job.

34:55.550 --> 34:57.710
Not anymore. I quit.

34:59.670 --> 35:02.640
seriously,mel,where are you going to go?

35:02.640 --> 35:05.350
You leave,you're over.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.340
But that's not where it ended,is it?

35:10.110 --> 35:11.750
You killed nikki,didn't you,melinda?

35:12.570 --> 35:13.720
...You're over.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.020
No. You are.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.870
no.

35:28.870 --> 35:30.470
I didn't kill nikki.

35:30.470 --> 35:33.120
The murder weapon had fluorescent uv bulbs.

35:33.490 --> 35:34.220
So?

35:34.220 --> 35:37.770
So they shattered when you threw the tanning lamp into the water.

35:42.190 --> 35:43.600
Stand up,melinda.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.800
Ultraviolet waves are invisible.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.190
The bulbs are lined with a phosphor uv coating

35:52.920 --> 35:55.150
which allows it to glow under ultraviolet light.

35:56.070 --> 35:57.220
When nikki had a seizure,

35:57.220 --> 35:59.760
she splashed the water in the tub on everything,

36:00.510 --> 36:01.620
including you.

36:08.150 --> 36:11.420
the water carried those phosphor shards onto your clothing.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.450
When the water evaporated,

36:16.490 --> 36:18.380
it left the glass behind.

36:29.140 --> 36:32.740
Did you know she got $100,000just to show up at a premiere?

36:33.660 --> 36:35.420
Never even stayed for the movie.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.760
And all she paid me?

36:39.240 --> 36:40.740
500 a week.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.680
She didn't deserve the life she had.

36:44.170 --> 36:46.580
She didn't deserve to die,either.

37:03.770 --> 37:04.510
Eric.

37:05.910 --> 37:07.890
Hey. Look,i got to run.Can it wait?

37:07.890 --> 37:10.090
I heard you're not going to the ceremony today.

37:10.630 --> 37:11.380
Where'd you hear that?

37:11.380 --> 37:13.340
Everyone kind of heard.

37:13.340 --> 37:15.600
Everyone needs to mind their business.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.550
Well,marisol could say the same to you.

37:19.560 --> 37:21.420
You haven't been through what i've been through with her.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.590
Okay?

37:23.990 --> 37:25.260
Do you trust her?

37:25.260 --> 37:27.410
Yes,of course.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.880
And I know you trust horatio with your life.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.890
So don't you trust these two to make this decision?

37:33.580 --> 37:37.510
Look...I've been taking care of marisol ever since she got sick.

37:39.050 --> 37:40.800
I don't think she's ready for this.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.660
But this is not your decision.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.710
She didn't even invite our family.

37:45.410 --> 37:46.790
That's not the way we do things.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.450
It's her wedding day,eric.

37:49.870 --> 37:52.800
She probably didn't want to hear that speech,did you think of that?

37:55.350 --> 37:56.330
No.

37:57.370 --> 37:59.540
She just really wants to be happy.

38:01.190 --> 38:02.990
And I know her brother wants that,too.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.980
I got to do trace on these $100 bills.

38:40.910 --> 38:41.970
Eric,what did we get?

38:43.120 --> 38:46.200
I found iodine crystals on one of the bills used to buy lucia.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.900
Iodine. It's possible that cervantes' men used it in their kitchen.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.590
I don't think so.

38:52.050 --> 38:53.870
I found this bill in the middle of an unwrapped bundle.

38:53.870 --> 38:55.810
Cervantes' men never touched it.

38:55.810 --> 38:56.840
Okay.

38:57.370 --> 38:58.530
Wait a minute.

38:58.530 --> 39:02.320
Wait a minute,danville had iodine on his hands,didn't he?

39:02.320 --> 39:03.660
He's got lucia.

39:13.330 --> 39:15.140
I just develop the drug formula.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.530
I can't help what people do with it.

39:16.660 --> 39:17.680
This is not about the drugs.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.720
I'm talking about lucia;where is she?

39:20.000 --> 39:20.670
Who?

39:20.670 --> 39:23.060
The woman you purchased from your partners. Where is she?

39:26.650 --> 39:28.710
I haven't touched her,I swear.

39:28.710 --> 39:30.550
I am certain she's gonna have a different story.

39:30.720 --> 39:34.920
So for the last time,take me to her,right now.

39:49.570 --> 39:52.200
Danville said she was locked in a back room.

40:02.970 --> 40:04.340
Lucia?

40:08.990 --> 40:10.730
Lucia,it's okay,honey.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.370
It's all right.

40:16.870 --> 40:18.440
Isabella sent me.

40:19.740 --> 40:21.140
Isabella?

40:21.180 --> 40:22.580
That's right.

40:22.580 --> 40:26.060
Isabella.Lucia...

40:27.640 --> 40:28.930
you're free.

40:33.340 --> 40:37.970
come on.You're free,honey.

41:01.490 --> 41:03.060
Ladies.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.770
I don't know how to thank you.

41:05.570 --> 41:07.840
Well,there's no need,ma'am,there's no need.

41:08.110 --> 41:10.880
All my sister wanted was to come to america,to be happy.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.980
Now she can.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.480
Now,I want you to go with this lady.She's gonna help you.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.440
And this is my card.If you need anything,you'll call me.

41:21.230 --> 41:22.260
Okay?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.440
Thank you.

41:23.450 --> 41:24.830
All right,ladies,good luck.

41:29.010 --> 41:30.820
How's that for a wedding present?

41:32.510 --> 41:33.870
The best kind.

41:33.870 --> 41:35.580
We all pitched in.

41:38.150 --> 41:39.220
Wow.

41:39.810 --> 41:41.660
This is a good year,too.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.350
We hope you have a lot more to come.

41:43.800 --> 41:44.880
Congratulations.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.410
Thank you,pal.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.340
You'll tell the others?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.550
I will.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.150
You look beautiful.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.510
You don't look so bad yourself.

42:32.330 --> 42:33.320
Any doubts?

42:33.590 --> 42:35.770
Nope. You?

42:36.560 --> 42:37.550
No way.

42:38.850 --> 42:40.700
Listen,I don't think eric's going to show.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.280
I beg to differ.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.560
Hey,sis.

42:47.150 --> 42:48.720
Eric.

42:52.650 --> 42:53.690
Thanks,little brother.

42:53.690 --> 42:55.040
Sir.

42:57.080 --> 42:58.550
Wouldn't have missed it.

42:58.550 --> 43:01.630
You ready?I sure am.

43:23.460 --> 43:25.050
I got a clear shot.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.750
I can get the hit and get away clean.

43:28.540 --> 43:30.190
I've got it all mapped out.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.020
Just give me the okay.
