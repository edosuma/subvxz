15:15.001 --> 15:16.524
Yeah. Whoa.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.005
[water gurgling]

15:19.048 --> 15:20.310
It was nice to..

15:22.269 --> 15:25.141
[eerie whispering]

15:34.107 --> 15:36.065
[panting]

15:38.241 --> 15:40.069
[whispering continues]

15:43.464 --> 15:45.248
- Miranda.
- Ha!

15:45.292 --> 15:47.468
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing?

15:47.511 --> 15:49.557
- Were you following me?
- You were gone a long time.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.298
I was worried.

15:51.341 --> 15:52.908
Sorry. I..

15:57.347 --> 15:58.522
I just got spooked.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.092
Are you sure you're okay?

16:03.136 --> 16:04.702
Yeah. I'm fine.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.360
[intense music]

16:25.158 --> 16:26.986
[birds chirping]

16:29.727 --> 16:32.513
[instrumental music]

17:02.630 --> 17:05.502
[music continues]

17:24.042 --> 17:26.871
[engine revving]

17:33.269 --> 17:36.533
You're right.
The new girl's hot.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.796
- Her name is Miranda.
- Miranda?

17:40.407 --> 17:42.104
Well, did you hand Miranda
your balls outright

17:42.148 --> 17:44.063
or did you just
put a sold sign on your junk?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.108
- Shut up.
- Ha-ha.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.283
You know, it just seems
like a lot of work

17:47.327 --> 17:48.763
when Ginny's still dyin'
to climb that that

17:48.806 --> 17:50.547
teach strip pole,
if you know what I'm saying.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.375
Believe it or not,
I can decode

17:52.419 --> 17:53.898
that sort of metaphor.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.425
- Want that?
- Mm.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.601
- Be right back.
- Alright.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.473
[instrumental music]

18:07.956 --> 18:10.785
[indistinct chatter]

18:19.359 --> 18:21.883
Couldn't manage one day
with outside contact?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.537
Yeah.
Something like that.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.930
I get it. Your boyfriend
probably misses you.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.716
Yeah. Javier gets really upset
when I don't check in.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.936
He's a bodybuilder.
So I don't like to make him mad.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.809
Plus, I also
have to email social services

18:34.852 --> 18:37.507
to let them know Amelia hasn't
locked me in the basement.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.640
'Cause that's something
we're worried about.

18:39.683 --> 18:40.771
Probably not.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
One second.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.914
Nelson here was actually
just wrapping things up.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.133
Thanks, Nelson.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.750
So, what do you
have to do tomorrow night?

19:02.793 --> 19:05.231
I was thinking
a little brooding

19:05.274 --> 19:07.668
maybe penning some
angsty poetry, for sure

19:07.711 --> 19:09.974
avoiding awkward conversation
with my only living relative.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.759
You know, the usual.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.195
Tried out the whole
poetry thing for a while

19:13.239 --> 19:14.849
after my mom passed away.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.895
My eye in [indistinct]
definitely needs work.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.246
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.467
Anyway, if you get bored
of poetry, there's this thing

19:24.511 --> 19:26.208
happening down at the yacht club
tomorrow night.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.210
'Sort of an island tradition to
kick off the start of summer.'

19:28.254 --> 19:29.603
You should come.

19:29.646 --> 19:30.995
Good for angst-drowning.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.435
- Yeah. Maybe.
- Alright.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.523
I'll see you there.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.359
[computer beeps]

19:55.846 --> 19:58.501
[indistinct chatter]

20:01.852 --> 20:04.725
[keys clacking]

20:13.516 --> 20:16.345
[instrumental music]

20:24.875 --> 20:27.791
- Oh, my gosh. You're Miranda.
- I'm Cece N. Cooper.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.750
My mom told me not
to bother you this week

20:29.793 --> 20:31.142
because you and your mom
have like tons of bonding

20:31.186 --> 20:32.448
and whatever
to make up for, but

20:32.492 --> 20:33.797
I'm pretty sure
she just said that

20:33.841 --> 20:35.321
'cause her Botox
went a little wanky

20:35.364 --> 20:36.713
and she's desperate
for company.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.193
Anyways, I couldn't wait
to meet you.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.977
Plus Ginny says
you're a total freak.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.675
Which means,
we're gonna be BFFs.

20:41.718 --> 20:44.504
- It's nice to meet you.
- What are you doing right now?

20:44.547 --> 20:45.853
Do you want to grab
ice-cream with me?

20:45.896 --> 20:47.637
My treat, I mean
not that I don't think

20:47.681 --> 20:49.030
you can afford ice cream.
You're..

20:49.073 --> 20:50.249
You don't seem
poor or anything.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.120
I just...wanna be nice.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.730
- I have to be somewhere.
- Okay.

21:00.868 --> 21:04.350
Sorry, uh, you caught me
in weird moment.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.395
- Cece, right?
- Right.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.963
I guess
I'm having a hard time

21:09.006 --> 21:10.747
coping with moving
to a small town

21:10.791 --> 21:12.358
where everyone knows my height,
weight and shoe size.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.142
Oh, no one
can get your shoe size.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.404
I've been trying all day.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.931
[chuckling]

21:20.975 --> 21:22.803
Ginny goes to Deerfield,
but, you know

21:22.846 --> 21:24.674
my parents aren't into
the whole catholic-school thing.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.415
Bobby and TJ go to Exeter.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.591
Bobby's dad,
he used to play football.

21:28.635 --> 21:31.594
But you know, he owns like seven
restaurants. He's a creeper.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.684
And Kate's totally bulimic but
we all pretend not to notice.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.686
And that sends her
toward the cove.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.471
Everything else is tiny
territory

21:38.514 --> 21:40.124
which is better left
than explored.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.083
[instrumental music]

21:44.085 --> 21:45.956
[Miranda]
Hey, what do you know about Leo?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.349
Not much.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.003
Townies usually
avoid the heirs.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.484
Airs?

21:51.527 --> 21:53.268
- Heirs with an 'H?'
- Ah.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.835
'It's what the townies call
the summer people'

21:54.878 --> 21:57.011
''cause we all inherited land.'

21:57.054 --> 21:59.274
Come on. Let's go say hi.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.233
- N-no way. He's hot, but he's--
- What? Four?

22:02.277 --> 22:04.627
Disturbed. There's a ton
of stories about that guy.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.327
Leo. Hey.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.685
What happened to your scars?

22:20.469 --> 22:23.907
You seem very interested
in my body.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.170
I'm not.
I just wanted to say hey.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.435
Hey.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.133
[TJ]
Miranda.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.528
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.312
We were just leaving.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.358
TJ, you didn't tell
new girl the rules.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.447
It's not really a good idea
to friend the help.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.492
You're right,
you never know when we might

22:43.536 --> 22:45.233
uh, piss in your champagne.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.891
- Bobby!
- Oops.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.719
Careful.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.721
I doubt they teach you to throw
a decent punch at Exeter.

22:54.764 --> 22:56.766
Oh, fish stick wants a fight.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.855
[Miranda]
Stop it.
Nobody wants a fight.

22:58.899 --> 23:01.292
Do they?

23:01.336 --> 23:04.600
- Come on, Bobby.
- Yeah, it's no problem.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.385
I got to get back
to the restaurant, anyway.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.082
My dad is having an issue
with one of the waitresses.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.954
She keeps propositioning
to customers.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.695
Oh, wait a sec.
Her name is Naomi.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.872
Isn't that your sister?

23:15.916 --> 23:18.484
Oh. This is a small world.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.147
- What are you doing with him?
- Me?

23:30.191 --> 23:31.671
What are you
doing with that guy?

23:31.714 --> 23:33.194
Bobby, he's a dick
but he is harmless.

23:33.237 --> 23:36.153
And Leo's not?

23:36.197 --> 23:37.198
[male #1]
'Can I get some help here?'

23:37.241 --> 23:38.286
'Is she alright?'

23:45.162 --> 23:46.250
What?

23:46.294 --> 23:48.427
[indistinct gasping]

23:48.470 --> 23:50.516
- Oh, my God.
- Is that..

23:50.559 --> 23:53.127
- Kit.
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:00.264 --> 24:03.354
[instrumental music]

24:03.398 --> 24:05.966
Fishing crew found her body
tangled in the lines.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.098
I guess she wasn't
a very strong swimmer.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.449
Kit was an experienced diver.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.363
She drowned.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.627
She could've misjudged
how much gas was in her tanks

24:14.670 --> 24:17.020
or hit her head or lost
consciousness underwater.

24:17.064 --> 24:20.197
There were, um..
Thought she had like..

24:22.286 --> 24:24.637
Something got to the body
after the fact.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.421
Could've been a seal
or a shark.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.685
I've called the mainland police.
They're sending an ME.

24:29.729 --> 24:30.643
Look, I don't need
a corner to tell me

24:30.686 --> 24:32.427
the cause of death was drowning.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.907
Her lungs were full of water.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.691
Well, if there was
something in that water..

24:35.735 --> 24:38.172
...I think we need to know.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.261
What's your relationship
to Kit Morgan, Mr. Elinsworth?

24:40.304 --> 24:41.871
I'm the Cunningham's
legal counsel.

24:41.915 --> 24:42.872
And until they're back
from Europe

24:42.916 --> 24:44.526
I'm also Ginny's guardian.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.528
What about the victim's parents?

24:46.572 --> 24:48.225
You need family
to identify the body.

24:48.269 --> 24:51.272
Uncle Lou is like 80.
He has Alzheimer's.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.230
That's why Kit
was staying with us.

24:53.274 --> 24:56.973
Dan'll be back by the weekend.
Now, if you'll excuse us..

24:57.017 --> 24:58.540
...the family could use
some privacy.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.158
I've to pick up
my dress from the tailor's

25:08.202 --> 25:09.943
and get my nails done
before tonight.

25:09.986 --> 25:13.555
Look, Ginny. No one expects you
to go tonight. You know that.

25:13.599 --> 25:17.124
I'm fine. I'm not
gonna miss the heirs party.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.082
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.043
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Yeah.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.004
[sighs]
It's happening again.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.529
I saw Kit's body.
That wasn't a seal or a shark.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.661
No point in jumping
to conclusions.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.141
Alright? Let the ME
do his thing.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.577
- But, dad--
- Look, TJ.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.579
Enough.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.625
You'll make it harder on
the family than it already is.

25:39.668 --> 25:40.582
Okay?

25:49.983 --> 25:52.812
[birds chirping]

25:58.339 --> 26:01.124
[instrumental music]

26:31.285 --> 26:34.157
[music continues]

27:04.318 --> 27:07.190
[music continues]

27:16.504 --> 27:17.505
[Miranda]
'Amelia.'

27:17.548 --> 27:18.680
[knock on door]

27:23.903 --> 27:25.208
Come in.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.475
Omg. Did you even bathe today?

27:31.519 --> 27:33.216
No, actually.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.088
Right, okay,
go sanitize while I find

27:35.131 --> 27:36.611
something acceptable in here.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.092
- For what?
- Um, the heirs party.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.921
It's not cancelled?

27:41.964 --> 27:43.357
They found
a dead body yesterday.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.490
Well, it's not like
she was an heir.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.057
A human died.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.972
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

27:50.016 --> 27:52.888
Sorry, I didn't mean to be
an ....

27:52.932 --> 27:54.803
I guess I just meant
that it's your first day here

27:54.847 --> 27:56.152
it's not like
any of us even met her.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.024
Still seems wrong
to have a party.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.939
Well, if it makes
you feel any better

27:59.982 --> 28:01.767
there will be
a moment of silence

28:01.810 --> 28:03.464
and a very tasteful slideshow.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.469
[Cece]
Hmm. Ooh.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.558
This blue dress doesn't suck.

28:10.601 --> 28:11.733
Come on, stand up.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.258
Will the townies be there?

28:15.302 --> 28:16.825
No. No, no, no. No, no.

28:16.869 --> 28:19.001
Leo was hot,
but he's unbalanced.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.830
Do everyone a favor and help
TJ cheat on Ginny instead.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.745
What's the deal
with them, anyway?

28:23.789 --> 28:25.747
TJ and Leo,
not TJ and Ginny.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.879
Unsolved mystery.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.576
Leo's mom used
to clean TJ's house.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.578
And they were like best friends.
And when Mrs. E died

28:30.621 --> 28:32.275
Leo just dropped TJ.

28:36.236 --> 28:39.065
TJ was totally destroyed.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.764
Leo didn't even show up
for the funeral.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.811
Now, go bathe
before I call Hazmat?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.118
Thank you.

28:51.251 --> 28:54.123
[electronic music]

29:16.929 --> 29:18.800
Why is everyone looking at me?

29:18.844 --> 29:21.281
The same families have been
coming here for a hundred years.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.673
People are curious
about you.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.153
That's all.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.460
Unless Ginny told
everyone you got herpes.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.462
This must be Miranda.
Look at you two.
