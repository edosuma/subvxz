[seagulls squawking]

00:16.891 --> 00:19.853
[dance beat]

00:19.894 --> 00:23.898
- B-U-M-P-E-R, Bumper.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.276
Berlin to Atlanta, one-way.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.486
Well, no, I don't have
my credit card information,

00:28.528 --> 00:31.197
because I'm sitting
in a dumpster.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.450
You know what?
Agent.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.118
Agent.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.662
Wow, press seven for English?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.456
This really is
a different country.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.458
Ah.
- Bumper, there you are.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.585
- Okay, no.
- I was so frightened.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.628
I haven't been this scared
since my mother read me

00:45.670 --> 00:48.006
a normal German fairy tale
as a child.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.383
- I don't remember inviting
you into my dumpster, Pieter.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.093
There's not enough
room in here.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.637
Actually, there is.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.057
Dumpsters here are
way nicer and cleaner

00:57.098 --> 00:58.433
than dumpsters in America.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.102
- Look, I know you're
mad at me for lying.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.521
- Mm-hmm.
- Please talk to me.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.398
You're supposed to be
on stage in two minutes.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.484
- It's just Gisela, man.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.986
"99 Luftballons"
and "Take On Me"

01:10.028 --> 01:11.821
are my someone else's song.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.491
I was just so petrified
to get on stage by myself,

01:14.532 --> 01:17.077
but I at least had
a song to sing.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.204
- Listen to me.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.749
It might seem easy
to hide from failure,

01:22.791 --> 01:26.211
but you thrive when presented
with a challenge.

01:26.252 --> 01:30.340
I've never seen anyone
improvise like you.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.385
This is no different
than an a cappella riff-off.

01:33.426 --> 01:37.764
You are the front man,
and Heidi and I are behind you.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.683
- Yeah, I guess I did
kinda own in college.

01:39.724 --> 01:40.642
- Yeah.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.559
- You didn't know
me in college,

01:41.601 --> 01:43.186
but I was really
cool in college.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.688
Man, God,
I was cool in college.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.524
- [gasps]
I know what you need.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.943
[wildly vocalizing intro
to "Sweet Child O' Mine"]

01:49.984 --> 01:52.278
- Okay, no.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.280
No, no, no, no, no.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.448
Stop doing this!

01:58.118 --> 01:59.452
Ugh, God.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.292
* She's got a smile
that it seems to me *

02:06.334 --> 02:09.838
* Reminds me
of childhood memories *

02:09.879 --> 02:14.968
* Where everything was as fresh
as the bright blue sky *

02:15.010 --> 02:16.678
- * Sky *
- * Sky *

02:16.720 --> 02:18.054
- * Sky *

02:18.096 --> 02:21.474
both: * Whoa, oh, sweet child *

02:21.516 --> 02:22.642
[muted]
* Of mine *

02:22.684 --> 02:25.437
[both vocalize instrumental]

02:25.478 --> 02:26.813
- * Where do we go? *

02:26.855 --> 02:29.065
- Okay, yes.
- * Where do we go now? *

02:29.107 --> 02:31.359
- This seems important
for them.

02:31.401 --> 02:37.907
both: * Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
sweet child of mine *

02:37.949 --> 02:44.539
[harmonizing note]

02:44.581 --> 02:45.623
- Yes.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.709
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

02:47.751 --> 02:49.044
- That felt good.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.211
That did. That felt good.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.756
- Go get 'em,
sweet Bumper of mine.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.344
[dramatic music]

02:57.385 --> 03:00.347

[indistinct chatter]

03:19.407 --> 03:21.159
- Whoo!
- [clears throat]

03:21.201 --> 03:22.994
What's up, Berlin?
[mic feedback]

03:23.036 --> 03:24.037
all: Oh!

03:24.079 --> 03:26.998
[crowd boos]

03:28.875 --> 03:30.752
- [whispers]
What would Bumper do?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.464
[crowd booing]
- Boo!

03:39.719 --> 03:41.680
- [normal voice] Sir, would you
mind repeating that, please?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.808
- Of course.
Thank you for asking so nicely.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.395
Boo!
Du bist scheisse!

03:48.436 --> 03:50.605
[all booing]

03:50.647 --> 03:53.066

Du bist scheisse.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.028
- [deeper] Boo!
[echoing] Bist scheisse.

Boo!

[a cappella of
"Message in a Bottle" loops]

04:07.122 --> 04:08.581
[continues looping]
Bist scheisse.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.584
- * I know that you like me *

04:11.626 --> 04:14.170
* And it's kinda frightenin' *

04:14.212 --> 04:16.673
* Standing here waitin',
waitin' *

04:16.715 --> 04:19.759
* And I became hypnotized *

04:19.801 --> 04:22.595

* Tongue-tied *

04:24.806 --> 04:27.183
* You could be
the one that I love *

04:28.852 --> 04:31.604
- * I could be the one
that you dream of *

04:31.646 --> 04:33.023
- Scheiss-scheisse.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.860

is all I can do *

04:36.901 --> 04:41.114

[cheers and applause]

04:51.499 --> 04:52.500

[accordion music]

* *

04:57.547 --> 05:00.550
Yeah!
[laughs]

05:00.592 --> 05:02.385
- Bumper, that was unreal!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.471
- God.
Oh, did I just crush it?

05:04.512 --> 05:05.430
- Yeah.
- I had a complete

05:05.472 --> 05:06.973
red-out up there.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.975
That's when you black out when
you're singing Taylor Swift.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.185
both: Oh.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.644
- Look, I don't love
what happened yesterday,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.897
but you got me out
of my comfort zone

05:13.938 --> 05:15.148
for the first time
in a long time,

05:15.190 --> 05:17.359
and it actually paid off,
so you might not be

05:17.400 --> 05:18.735
such a bad manager after all.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.320
- [sighs]

05:20.362 --> 05:22.447
Thank you.
- Don't sweat it.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.740
The past is the past.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.158
That's why we call it
the present.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.577
- Well, I overheard a reporter
say that they're going

05:27.619 --> 05:29.037
to give you a great write-up

05:29.079 --> 05:30.497
in the German version
of "Variety,"

05:30.538 --> 05:32.207
"Uniformity," so yay!

05:32.248 --> 05:33.958
- [gags]
- [gags]

05:34.000 --> 05:34.959
- Oh, my Go--

05:35.001 --> 05:36.378
[both gag]

05:36.419 --> 05:38.296
- [laughs]
- Oh, man.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.839
And honestly, thank you
for the advice last night.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.257
- Thea!

05:41.299 --> 05:43.259
- If it wasn't for you,
I'd be halfway home by now.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.928
- Oh, don't mention it.

05:44.969 --> 05:48.014
Seriously, do not mention it,
the whole Karen Fraren thing.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.016
Don't.
- Okay.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.101
Okay.
- Cool.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.060
- Hey, guys.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.357
So have you changed your mind
about producing Bumper?

05:57.399 --> 05:59.818
- Well, your client can sing,

05:59.859 --> 06:03.113
but can he also write
new material?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.949
He has the emotional depth
of a Cheesecake Factory.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.909
- Okay, well,
that doesn't make any sense

06:07.951 --> 06:10.286
'cause I've cried in so many
Cheesecake Factories.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.122
- The artists I connect with

06:12.163 --> 06:15.542
don't just mimic other people's
emotions through covers.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.670
Look, I wanna help you.
You're my brother.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.588
But the road
to Unity Day is hard,

06:20.630 --> 06:23.049
even for the most
seasoned performers,

06:23.091 --> 06:25.468
let alone for this.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.014
Goodbye.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.099
- Hey, uh, just hold on.
Give me a second.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.393
- Okay, good.
Please explain to her

06:33.435 --> 06:36.146
that the Cheesecake Factory's
amazing!

06:36.187 --> 06:38.106
Thank God we have an American
on the team.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.566
[festival music]

06:39.607 --> 06:41.526
[people laughing
and chattering]

06:41.568 --> 06:43.737
- Hello!
Uh, Thea?

06:43.778 --> 06:46.614
Hi, I'm Heidi.
I'm Pieter's assistant.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.742
Um, I am a huge fan of yours.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.118
I really, really love
that one song you do

06:50.160 --> 06:52.037
that goes pew-pew-pew
beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.788
That song's, like,
the story of my life.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.667
- Every young woman experiences
pew-pew-pew at some point.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.752
- Yeah.
Hey, look.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.754
Just wanna let you know,
I think you made

07:00.795 --> 07:02.922
the right choice
not working with Bumper.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.924
- Um, thank you?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.801
- Yeah, I, uh,
I think it's really savvy

07:06.843 --> 07:08.720
to stay away
from unfamiliar artists.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.221
Don't wanna work
with anyone that is

07:10.263 --> 07:11.598
too fresh or too risky.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.184
- [laughs airily]
Firstly,

07:14.225 --> 07:15.560
I take many risks.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.480
I will take any pill
that I will find on any floor.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.275
Secondly,

07:22.317 --> 07:24.694
I know what you're doing.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.029
- I know what I'm doing too.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.781
I've spent time
with Bumper now,

07:27.822 --> 07:29.324
and I can tell you,
there's a lot

07:29.366 --> 07:30.658
bubbling under that surface.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.869
He's not just
any old TikTok star.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.996
I mean,
he is an old TikTok star,

07:35.038 --> 07:36.623
but he has depth.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.458
[tender music]

07:38.500 --> 07:39.834
- [sighs]

07:43.088 --> 07:44.464
Okay.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.341
I have Bjork coming
in on Tuesday,

07:46.383 --> 07:47.634
but Monday is free.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.095
I'll give Bumper one day
to show me something--

07:50.136 --> 07:52.013
lyrics, a melody,

07:52.055 --> 07:54.474
a bribe at least.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.268
You know, you're refreshing.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.938
Most people are too scared
of me to confront me.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.190
- Well, I'm not
like most people.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.737
[squelching]

08:11.366 --> 08:14.327
[intense pop music]

08:14.369 --> 08:21.418
* *

08:21.459 --> 08:23.628
- Wow, you look
like a sexy yak.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.297
- Oh, Pieter,
it must be so hard for you

08:26.339 --> 08:27.924
to show your face in public.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.926
It's so brave of you
to be here.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.886
Ugh, and, Bumper, I'm so sorry.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.514
I completely forgot that
that was your mash-up.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.599
Oh, it would have
been so terrible

08:36.641 --> 08:38.935
if I had ruined
your performance.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.854
Your butt must be so empty

08:40.895 --> 08:42.772
after pulling that stunt
out of it.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.191
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, well, his empty butt

08:45.233 --> 08:47.068
is going to get us
to Unity Day!

08:47.110 --> 08:48.570
- Yup.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.655
- You're going to try
to play Unity Day?

08:50.697 --> 08:52.699
- You got that right.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.994
- [laughing]
I'm sorry, but that is just--

08:56.036 --> 08:57.328
that is so cute.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.666
Aw, what an adorable
little dream

09:01.708 --> 09:03.376
that you will never realize.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.337
[laughs]

09:05.378 --> 09:06.629
- Why do you say that?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.048
- Oh, I just meant
that you are like

09:08.089 --> 09:10.508
one of those cute
little dogs on Instagram.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.345
You know, they're wearing
their little football jerseys.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.056
And they are so excited
to play, but, of course,

09:16.097 --> 09:18.433
we know that they won't
because, you know,

09:18.475 --> 09:20.185
they're just dogs.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.728
They don't know
how to kick a ball.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.563
- [scoffs]

09:23.605 --> 09:24.898
Well, it sucks
to be you, Gisela.

09:24.939 --> 09:25.899
- Oh, does it?
- It does.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.984
- Mm-hmm?
- Because I actually

09:28.026 --> 09:31.738
already have an original song
for Unity Day.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.948
both: You do?
- Yeah, I do,

09:33.990 --> 09:37.160
and when it drops, it'll be
number one in all of Germany,

09:37.202 --> 09:39.496
and you will be old news

09:39.537 --> 09:42.165
like Sully on the Hudson,

09:42.207 --> 09:44.751
and I'll be one
of the little birds

09:44.793 --> 09:47.712
getting all up in your engine
to take you down.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.423
[tense electronic music]

09:50.465 --> 09:51.841
- That's right?
- Yeah.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.760
- You are like one
of those little ducklings

09:53.802 --> 09:55.512
just shitting yourself
in the water.

09:55.553 --> 10:00.517
Perhaps I should go and work
on my original song.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.394
Until next time,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.145
woof, woof, Bumper Allen.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.438
Woof, woof.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.274
* *

10:08.316 --> 10:09.943
- [whimpers]

10:13.988 --> 10:16.574
- Ah, why did I say that?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.119
- It's okay.
I totally get it.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.413
She always throws me
off my bearing.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.124
Gisela makes me flustered.
I wanna give her the custard.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.917
But don't worry,
you have time.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.502
- Thea says
she'll give you one day.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.837
- [scoffs]
- Okay.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.130
Well, how long is a day
in the metric system?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.674
both: It's the same.
- Oh, that's bad.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.763
[a cappella scale]

10:38.805 --> 10:42.225
- Ah, everybody here
is really good at soccer.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.935
- Yes, Bumper, focus.
- Okay.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.228
- Are you ready for this?

10:45.270 --> 10:46.980
Thea's expecting you
to come prepared.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.565
- Okay, well,
if by prepared you mean

10:48.606 --> 10:51.067
having eaten breakfast and
wearing clean underwear,

10:51.109 --> 10:53.153
then...

10:53.194 --> 10:54.195
I am half prepared.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.739
- [sighs]
Okay, ha-ha-ha.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.867
But also, you came up with
some ideas for her last night,

10:58.908 --> 11:00.660
like, even just half ideas?

11:00.702 --> 11:03.121
- Nah, I work better
under pressure.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.831
Don't worry.
I'll pull this off

11:04.873 --> 11:06.332
just like I did Pretzel Fest.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.543
We just have
to break it down into steps.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.130
Step one,
write a song to impress Thea.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.757
See?
It's easy.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.925
It's just one step.
Anyone can do one step.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.011
- Yeah,
that's the right attitude.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.596
It's high-pressure but fun,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.639
like a bidet.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.141
- Okay, here we are.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.144
[dramatic music]

11:26.186 --> 11:27.145
* *

11:27.187 --> 11:28.730
Let's do it.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.069
- [Spanish accent]
Let's do it.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.528
[crow caws]
[knocking at door]

11:35.570 --> 11:36.613
- Come in.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.073
[metal rock playing]

11:38.114 --> 11:39.532
- Hey.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.868
[music stops]
What's up, you honking bitch?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.495
[laughing]
I am so sorry.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.163
I tried to do the thing
that you liked before,

11:45.205 --> 11:46.998
where I'm really confident,
but I overshot.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.376
- No, it worked.
And in fact, I love it,

11:49.417 --> 11:50.919
shithead.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.796
- Wow,
gorgeous apartment, Thea.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.923
It--it looks like a--
like a grocery store

11:54.964 --> 11:57.092
the day before a snowstorm.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.511
- You've never been inside
your sister's apartment before?

11:59.552 --> 12:03.139
- Oh, well, uh, I mean,
it's a pretty new apartment...

12:03.181 --> 12:04.307
- Hi, you.
- And she--and she's very busy.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.475
- Hi.
[crow caws]

12:05.517 --> 12:06.393
- Our schedules don't
really align.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.644
We've been meaning to go to

12:07.686 --> 12:09.270
a dinner for my birthday
for three years now.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.189
- Well, it's not my fault
Pieter goes to sleep

12:11.231 --> 12:12.857
every night like a dork.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.275
I go to sleep whenever

12:14.317 --> 12:16.986
the pill I found
on the ground wears off.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.321
- Very cool.
- But hey,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.699
uh, if today goes well,
this could be a great

12:20.740 --> 12:23.660
opportunity for us
to start hanging out again.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.954
- Cool.
So it's just up to me

12:25.995 --> 12:28.748
to repair the relationship
between two siblings.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.625
No presh.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.006
Oh, is it time to music now?

12:36.047 --> 12:37.549
- All right, Bumper,
you got this!

12:37.590 --> 12:39.759
- Yoo!
[clears throat]

12:39.801 --> 12:41.386
- Does he got this?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.096
I believe in him,
but I also believe

12:43.138 --> 12:45.640
my sister is very scary
and hates posers.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.392
She thinks Halloween
should be outlawed

12:47.434 --> 12:50.562
because almost none
of those kids are real goblins.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.772
- I'm sure Bumper has
something up his sleeve.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.816
- Poopie balls!

12:54.858 --> 12:56.735
Poopie balls!

12:56.776 --> 12:59.738
Yeah, I'm gonna need a pop
filter for my Ps and my Bs.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.406
I don't know what's gonna
come into my head,

13:01.448 --> 13:04.451
but poopie and balls are
pretty big in my vocab.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.580
- This is your man?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.040
- You said you'd give him
the whole day.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.458
Let's see what he can do.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.752
- I think we're seeing it,
but okay.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.337
[device beeps]

13:15.378 --> 13:17.505
Recording track one.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.426
- Track one.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.889
Ha...
Right now?

13:25.930 --> 13:26.890
We're doing it right now?

13:26.931 --> 13:27.849
[device beeps]
- Yes.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.351
[pop beats plays]

13:29.392 --> 13:31.061
- * Uh-oh *

13:31.102 --> 13:33.438
* Bumper's got a tambourine *

13:33.480 --> 13:35.106
[chimes tinkle]
[grunts]

13:35.148 --> 13:36.441
- Track two.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.276
- * Wa--walls *

13:38.318 --> 13:40.528
- Three.
- * Big glass walls *

13:40.570 --> 13:43.114
- 15.
- * There's a keyboard *

13:43.156 --> 13:44.616
- Track 36.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.535
- * Power chord!
Then you quiet it down *

13:47.577 --> 13:50.497
- It's fine.
- [vocalizing]

13:50.538 --> 13:52.374
- So versatile, right?

13:52.415 --> 13:54.793
- I feel like the snare
is too loud in here.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.960
- There is no snare,

13:56.002 --> 13:57.629
and you aren't even
wearing headphones.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.297
- Gonna have to speak up, Thea.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.965
I can't hear you
over the snare.

14:01.007 --> 14:06.554
* *

14:06.596 --> 14:08.473
* Ich bin...
one week *

14:08.515 --> 14:09.933
[all sigh]
- * Since you looked at me *

14:09.974 --> 14:10.975
- Take it from the top.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.478
- [screaming]

14:13.520 --> 14:15.355
[tense music]

14:15.397 --> 14:17.941
- Today has been such a waste.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.401
I could have been making art

14:19.442 --> 14:21.778
or juggling the sexual desires

14:21.820 --> 14:23.863
of my many girlfriends
and boyfriends.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.907
We're done here.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.660
* *

14:28.702 --> 14:29.661
[door opens]

14:31.538 --> 14:33.373
- Sorry, I'll--
I'll try to go get her back.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.874
- Heidi, can I tell you
a secret?

14:34.916 --> 14:36.251
- Yeah.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.794
- I don't think
I'm doing that well.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.004
- What?
No!

14:39.045 --> 14:40.296
Oh, my God, no!

14:40.338 --> 14:42.298
You just--
I can't come up with anything.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.342
I'm a very bad liar.
Yes, you are blowing it.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.721
Hey, let's get some fresh air.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.098
I'm gonna show you what I do
when I need to get inspired.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.182
- [scoffs]

14:51.224 --> 14:52.600
Please let it be whippets.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.145
[French horn playing]
Ever since I got to Berlin,

14:55.186 --> 14:57.355
everything's just
happened so fast.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.898
I feel like I can't keep up.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.943
If I don't impress Thea,
I don't get Unity Day.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.445
If I don't get Unity Day,

15:03.486 --> 15:04.946
I have to go back
to my boring life,

15:04.988 --> 15:06.781
and I'll never
get this mole checked out,

15:06.823 --> 15:08.950
'cause I am not paying
for an American dermatologist.

15:08.992 --> 15:12.370
- Well, you know what?
Don't think about all of that.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.914
I mean, has the mole grown
since you got here?

15:14.956 --> 15:18.168
- Heidi, I didn't have it
when I got here.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.169
- Just relax.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.545
Making music is about

15:20.587 --> 15:22.172
getting out of your own head,

15:22.213 --> 15:23.673
like what you did
at Pretzel Fest.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.426
It's about expressing something
you feel in the moment.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.553
- But I can't get out
of my own head.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.555
There's just too much
riding on this.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.390
I--I had nothing to lose
at Pretzel Fest.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.268
But now,
everything just really matters,

15:35.310 --> 15:36.561
and I'm choking.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.229
I just want people
to like me too much.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.397
- Yeah, join the club.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.066
I want people
to like me so much

15:41.107 --> 15:44.152
that I can't even perform under
my own name in case I'm bad.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.112
- You wanna perform
under the name Bumper Allen?

15:46.154 --> 15:49.908
You'd have a credit score
of 400 because you got deep

15:49.949 --> 15:51.910
into an energy drink
pyramid scheme.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.161
[both laugh]

15:53.203 --> 15:55.705
I almost won a Mustang though.
- That's cool.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.665
- For real though, you have
nothing to worry about.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.876
I meant it
when I said you're great.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.045
You shouldn't be afraid
to show exactly who you are.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.632
- That's sweet, but, uh,
easier said than done.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.302
I'm not from here.
I moved around a ton.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.764
I always felt like an outsider.
It's hard for me to be social.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.933
That's why I started
songwriting.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.979
It was the one thing in my life
that was stable and consistent

16:20.021 --> 16:23.525
and...just for me.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.610
I didn't have people
to confide in,

16:25.652 --> 16:29.698
but I could put all
of my emotions into my songs.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.909
- Yeah, I thought
I found my people in college,

16:32.951 --> 16:34.828
my a cappella group.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.038
They all moved on.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.082
Makes me sad or whatever.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.208
- That!
That!

16:40.250 --> 16:42.585
You should use that!

16:42.627 --> 16:44.629
- Okay, um--
[clears throat]

16:44.671 --> 16:49.217
* I thought I found
my people in college *

16:49.259 --> 16:50.677
Like that?
- Uh--

16:50.719 --> 16:53.513
- * Skiddley doddely
doodley deedly dee *

16:53.555 --> 16:54.973
* In college *

16:55.015 --> 16:56.266
Scatman.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.268
- Work in progress.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.978
Let me teach you
how I write a song.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.354
Come on.
- Okay.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.522
- So it's this way.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.066
I always do my best
songwriting here.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.235
It makes me feel less lonely.

17:07.277 --> 17:11.239
You know, sometimes, I--I look
around at all of the people

17:11.281 --> 17:14.826
and I think,
they might not know

17:14.868 --> 17:18.204
the woman at the piano could
be a star one day.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.914
- I believe.
- [laughs]

17:19.956 --> 17:21.416
[piano plays]

17:21.458 --> 17:22.834
- Are we supposed to be here?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.836
- Oh, it's fine.
He'll be back in five.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.797
Okay, so you wanna start out
with chord progressions,

17:27.839 --> 17:30.925
so let's say this...
- Okay.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.678
- No, I don't like that.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.055
That's okay.
- Yeah, that sounds good.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.556
- We can work with that.

17:36.598 --> 17:40.769
[singing indistinctly]

17:40.810 --> 17:41.770
Okay.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.897
* *

17:43.938 --> 17:46.900
[humming]

17:49.903 --> 17:52.489
* It's all in my head *

17:52.530 --> 17:55.033
* It's all in my heart *

17:55.075 --> 17:59.996
* The light always finds a way
to shine through the dark *

18:00.038 --> 18:05.001
* It's way too late now
to turn it around *

18:05.043 --> 18:10.048
* I'm right at the edge,
but I'ma figure it out *

18:10.090 --> 18:14.219
* *

18:14.260 --> 18:17.806
[piano line builds]

18:17.847 --> 18:21.017
* One day they'll
know my name *

18:21.059 --> 18:22.769
- I like that.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.897
both: * One day
they'll know my name *

18:25.939 --> 18:27.941
* *

18:27.982 --> 18:31.361
- * One day I'm gonna
make it out this room *

18:31.403 --> 18:33.780
* I don't have
nothing to lose *

18:33.822 --> 18:38.034
* I'll be patient 'cause
I know it's on the way *

18:38.076 --> 18:41.663
both: * One day
they'll know my name *

18:41.705 --> 18:43.581
- * Oh, my God, Heidi *

18:43.623 --> 18:45.917
That was incredible.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.461
You just made that up
right now?

18:48.503 --> 18:51.464
- Yeah, it's whatever, blah.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.174
- No, it wasn't blah.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.677
If anything, it was mm-hmm.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.888
It had feeling,
and it made me feel something.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.932
Now I feel like
I know more about you.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.103
- Well, yeah.
Yeah, and honestly,

19:05.145 --> 19:07.022
it wasn't that bad.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.441
I think I might
work on that later.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.401
Thanks, Bumper.

19:11.443 --> 19:14.446
Turns out you inspired me
as much as I inspired you.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.656
- [chuckles]
- Now go up to Thea's

19:16.698 --> 19:18.867
and crush it.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.618
- What the hell
is goin' on here?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.619
- Oh, no.
Run!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.413
- No epiphanies on the piano!

19:23.455 --> 19:25.123
[upbeat music]

19:25.165 --> 19:27.292
- Sorry!
[laughs]

19:27.334 --> 19:31.254
* *

19:31.296 --> 19:34.215
[footsteps approaching]

19:34.257 --> 19:37.469
- [sighs]
Can you please just come back?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.803
What are you even doing?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.805
- The helmet makes me
Vitamin D-deficient,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.350
so I sun myself every day
for 30 minutes like a lizard

19:43.391 --> 19:45.477
or American sorority girl.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.604
And no, Bumper is terrible.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.813
- You say you want to help me,

19:48.855 --> 19:50.815
but you only care
about your reputation.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.359
You're just like Papa.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.110
- Dude, you're just like Papa!

19:54.152 --> 19:57.072
[both argue in German]

19:58.907 --> 20:00.200
- [sighs]

20:02.452 --> 20:03.536
[huffs]

20:03.578 --> 20:04.954
Look, I'm sorry.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.831
I didn't come here
to pick a fight.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.333
I came here to work.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.585
- See? You only came
because you need something.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.836
And that's insulting.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.380
You know, I'm not just
an incredible DJ,

20:13.421 --> 20:16.299
music producer, model,
activist, and X Games medalist.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.802
I am a person with feelings.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.887
- I was just scared
that you wouldn't want

20:20.929 --> 20:22.972
to see me unless I had
something to offer.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.016
- I should have
checked on you more,

20:25.058 --> 20:28.061
and I'm sorry we haven't
gotten the birthday dinner.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.355
But I do really care
about you as a person.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.649
[tender music]

20:32.691 --> 20:33.942
[cell phones chime and buzz]

20:36.111 --> 20:38.029
- [sighs]

20:38.071 --> 20:40.198
Oh, scheisse.
- What's this?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.034
- Gisela just released
a new original song.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.203
Oh, Bumper bragging
about having a song

20:45.245 --> 20:48.039
must have spurred her
on to release one first.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.958
- Okay.
[speaks German]

20:50.000 --> 20:53.461
- * They'll always know
when you're a bad farmer *

20:53.503 --> 20:55.588
* Bad, bad farmer *

20:55.630 --> 20:57.048
- Ugh.
- * Sad goats *

20:57.090 --> 20:59.926
* Bad, bad, bad farmer *

20:59.968 --> 21:03.013
- Oh, God,
sauerkraut, it's good.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.347
We have to come back
with something quick

21:04.389 --> 21:06.307
or else he'll fall behind,
and then Gisela will get

21:06.349 --> 21:08.560
the newcomer spot
at Unity Day and then--

21:08.601 --> 21:09.686
oh, God, I taste metal.

21:09.728 --> 21:10.729
[inhaling rapidly]

21:10.770 --> 21:12.188
- Okay.
- I can't get oxygen

21:12.230 --> 21:13.732
through my nose hairs.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.319
- [sings in German]

21:21.614 --> 21:24.784
[both sing in German]

21:27.871 --> 21:29.205
- [sighs]
- Better?

21:29.247 --> 21:31.916
- You haven't sang
that for me in years.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.210
- I never liked that girl.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.671
She was bad for you,
and she n--

21:36.713 --> 21:37.756
- I'm sorry, what?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.883
[soft dramatic music]

21:39.924 --> 21:41.593
- She never let you shine!

21:41.634 --> 21:43.511
Fine, I'll say it.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.722
- Oh. You think I'm shiny.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.098
- [laughing] Shut up.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.308
- [huffs]

21:48.350 --> 21:51.770
* *

21:51.811 --> 21:53.772
- I'll finish the day
with Bumper.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.773
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.733
- Oh, my God.

21:56.775 --> 21:58.443
Thank you, Thea.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.652
Everyone else hates me.

21:59.694 --> 22:00.945
- Yes, but let's not forget

22:00.987 --> 22:02.614
that I hated you first
before it was cool.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.948
- Accurate.
- And now, I need

22:03.990 --> 22:06.785
eight more minutes
of that sweet D,

22:06.826 --> 22:08.787
and I'll be back down.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.747
- Oh, yeah.
Okay, please.

22:10.789 --> 22:11.915
[clears throat]

22:13.083 --> 22:16.169
Heidi and I will
leave you two to it.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.379
- [sighs]

22:20.882 --> 22:24.010
[crow cawing]

22:29.099 --> 22:32.602
- All right,
how did she do this?

22:32.644 --> 22:35.730
[piano plays]

22:40.777 --> 22:43.238
* One day they'll
know my name *

22:43.279 --> 22:46.825
* *

22:46.866 --> 22:49.369
* One day they'll
know my name *

22:49.411 --> 22:51.329
Mm.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.582
* One day I'm gonna
make it out this room *

22:54.624 --> 22:57.752
[murmuring song]

22:57.794 --> 23:00.005
God, Heidi is so good.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.256
[device beeps]
- Don't stop.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.216
[surprised piano]
That's our song.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.551
- What are you doing?
- Listen.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.927
- [stammers]

23:05.969 --> 23:07.887
* One day they'll
know my name *

23:07.929 --> 23:11.016
[pop beat plays]

23:11.057 --> 23:14.978
* One day they'll
know my name *

23:15.020 --> 23:16.229
[device beeps]
- Okay, it's rough,

23:16.271 --> 23:18.106
but once you finish
recording your parts,

23:18.148 --> 23:19.899
I'll give it a proper mix.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.568
So just keep playing.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.029
- Yeah, no, I don't think
we should use that one.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.363
It's not really even my--
[feedback whines]

23:25.405 --> 23:28.074
- Keep playing!

23:34.956 --> 23:38.376
[piano plays]

23:39.169 --> 23:42.130
- * One day I'm gonna
make it out this room *

23:47.344 --> 23:48.178
[train rumbling]

23:48.219 --> 23:50.347
- Perfect.
Oh, fantastic.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.806
Send it over.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.224
[sighs]

23:53.266 --> 23:55.143
Whatever you said
to Bumper worked.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.437
He wrote a song,
and Thea loves it!

23:57.479 --> 23:59.314
She just wants to add
a few more pew-pew-pews,

23:59.356 --> 24:00.857
and then she'll send over
the demo.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.985
- That's great,
you big ol' bitch!

24:04.027 --> 24:06.279
I am so sorry.
I'm still in Thea mode.

24:07.739 --> 24:08.990
Please ignore that.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.744
- You know, I'm sure
Heidi will understand

24:12.786 --> 24:15.580
once I just explain it.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.665
It's not my fault!

24:17.707 --> 24:19.501
I'm just stupid.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.379
What do you think?

24:22.420 --> 24:24.381
- I think that we lost
our humanity

24:24.422 --> 24:28.176
when we agreed to let
industrialization become king.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.678
- For sure.
[cell phone dings]

24:29.719 --> 24:31.638
Oh, great.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.100
Heidi wants me to come to the
office and listen to the song.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.184
You're right, Ursula.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.477
I need to go and explain myself

24:37.519 --> 24:39.187
before Heidi hears it
and hates me forever.

24:39.229 --> 24:41.523
You're right!
You're right, Ursula!

24:41.564 --> 24:43.191
- There he goes,

24:43.233 --> 24:45.235
another piglet of capitalism.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.903
- Whoo!
[giggles]

24:46.945 --> 24:48.071
- Oh.
- Oh, look at that.

24:48.113 --> 24:49.531
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Ah, the star is here!

24:49.572 --> 24:51.449
- Oh, the star?
Before we listen to the song,

24:51.491 --> 24:52.617
I really need
to tell you something.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.910
- Okay.
- Me first.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.205
I misjudged you.

24:57.247 --> 25:02.168
I thought you were all voice,
no substance,

25:02.210 --> 25:03.211
but you're not.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.046
- And if you ended that with,

25:05.088 --> 25:06.506
"And the guacamole is free,"

25:06.548 --> 25:08.174
you literally would
have said everything

25:08.216 --> 25:09.050
I ever wanted to hear,
but first--

25:09.092 --> 25:10.552
- To Bumper,

25:10.593 --> 25:13.596
whose new song is going to be
our ticket to Unity Day.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.598
- And blow Gisela's
out of the water.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.726
- Will it though?
'Cause I think it sucks.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.269
It's a bad song.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.729
Let's just sit on it,

25:20.770 --> 25:23.148
marinate on whether
or not this is the one.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.066
- What? You're being silly.

25:25.108 --> 25:26.901
Thea says it's perfect.
- It is.

25:26.943 --> 25:28.069
- It's not.
- To Bumper!

25:28.111 --> 25:30.739
- To Bumper.
- To Bumper.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.198
Yeah.
- [laughs nervously]

25:34.075 --> 25:35.410
Oh, dang!

25:35.452 --> 25:37.412
That just slipped
right out of my mitts.

25:37.454 --> 25:39.039
Oh, we should really
clean this up.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.415
Maybe put a pin in this

25:40.457 --> 25:42.250
until we get the glass
situation figured out.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.918
- Don't worry.
There's more!

25:43.960 --> 25:45.086
- But the shards?
- Heidi,

25:45.128 --> 25:47.213
please debut
Thea's finished demo.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.381
- But the shards though,
Pieter!

25:48.423 --> 25:50.050
- Sister, may I have the honor?

25:50.091 --> 25:51.092
- But the shards!

25:51.134 --> 25:53.094
[dramatic electronic music]

25:53.136 --> 25:56.806
[slow-motion] But the shards...

25:56.848 --> 26:00.393
* *

26:00.435 --> 26:01.936
Now no one can listen to it.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.688
- Why'd you turn off
the lights?

26:05.607 --> 26:08.109
- * It's all in my head *

26:08.151 --> 26:10.570
* It's all in my heart *

26:10.612 --> 26:15.367
* The light always finds a way
to shine through the dark *

26:15.408 --> 26:16.576
* It's way too late now *

26:16.618 --> 26:18.411
Heide, I--

26:18.453 --> 26:20.038
- I gotta go.
- I can explain.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.623
It's--

26:21.664 --> 26:22.791
Heidi!

26:22.832 --> 26:24.834
[dramatic music]

26:24.876 --> 26:26.211
[door slams]

26:28.546 --> 26:32.342
- Somebody get the mash because
Bumper's song is a banger.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.178
- * One day they'll
know my name *

26:35.220 --> 26:38.056
* *
