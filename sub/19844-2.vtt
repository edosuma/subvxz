Huh? I mean, I know I'm adorable,

10:19.854 --> 10:21.654
but I'm extremely small potatoes.

10:21.656 --> 10:23.389
Well, you are Marcel's trusted friend.

10:23.391 --> 10:25.024
We had planned on learning
everything you know

10:25.026 --> 10:26.659
and then using you as collateral.

10:26.661 --> 10:28.861
But since you know so little...

10:28.863 --> 10:30.796
I would like to try my plan.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.531
Please don't do this.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.980
I want you to consider the risk.

10:34.983 --> 10:35.941
I have.

10:35.944 --> 10:37.970
I won't allow my family
to face that risk.

10:37.972 --> 10:40.539
[phone chimes]

10:46.191 --> 10:48.414
- Freya found Nik?
- Yes.

10:48.416 --> 10:51.817
You get our brother,
I will handle Marcel.

11:02.299 --> 11:03.698
MARCEL: Rebekah.

11:06.087 --> 11:07.953
I wasn't sure you'd show.

11:07.955 --> 11:10.623
I wasn't sure you'd still be you.

11:15.609 --> 11:18.198
I kept wondering if that
hex had eaten you alive.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.000
It would have.

11:20.002 --> 11:21.012
But I was...

11:21.015 --> 11:23.737
Linked... to Klaus.

11:23.739 --> 11:25.439
I know.

11:25.441 --> 11:28.208
I've known about that for a while.

11:30.346 --> 11:32.947
You had endless
opportunities to kill him.

11:32.949 --> 11:35.149
Did you hold off on my account?

11:37.853 --> 11:40.354
Then, please, Marcel.

11:40.356 --> 11:44.491
If some part of you still
cares about me, help me.

11:44.493 --> 11:46.660
For the sake of all
we've been to one another,

11:46.662 --> 11:49.430
for all that we've
shared, I am begging you

11:49.432 --> 11:51.336
to let my brother go.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.907
And if I say no?

11:59.909 --> 12:02.009
You know better than anyone

12:02.011 --> 12:04.178
that my family always
gets what it wants.

12:04.180 --> 12:07.781
No matter if it takes a thousand
days or a thousand years.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.632
Is he really worth that trouble?

12:14.890 --> 12:17.591
Come on... Rebekah.

12:17.593 --> 12:19.626
Did you really think it'd be that easy?

12:19.628 --> 12:21.895
All you have to do is ask nicely?

12:21.897 --> 12:24.999
Keeping Klaus hostage comes
with certain advantages.

12:25.001 --> 12:26.533
He makes a good trophy.

12:26.535 --> 12:29.236
Proof that I took down the
worst monster in the world.

12:29.238 --> 12:31.138
Any of my guys get bitten by wolves,

12:31.140 --> 12:33.140
I can use his blood to fix that.

12:33.142 --> 12:35.876
And, if I need to, I can use him

12:35.878 --> 12:37.711
to keep your family in line.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.313
Besides, if I'm being honest,

12:39.315 --> 12:42.149
he deserves to suffer.

12:42.151 --> 12:44.184
So, yeah.

12:44.186 --> 12:45.786
He is worth the trouble.

12:45.788 --> 12:48.122
Your logic is complete rubbish.

12:48.124 --> 12:50.424
You can stockpile enough of
his blood for all the cures

12:50.426 --> 12:53.060
that you'll ever need and if
it's a trophy that you're after,

12:53.062 --> 12:55.129
then you are not much
of a man to begin with.

12:55.131 --> 12:59.533
As for your pound of flesh,
you have had more than enough.

12:59.535 --> 13:01.520
Really?

13:01.523 --> 13:03.247
Considering what your family's done?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.605
We were at war.

13:04.607 --> 13:06.240
Wars have casualties.

13:06.242 --> 13:08.609
Blood is shed, mistakes are made.

13:08.611 --> 13:10.911
The man I loved understood that.

13:10.913 --> 13:14.681
Well, that man is long gone.

13:14.683 --> 13:17.051
Whose fault is that?

13:19.021 --> 13:21.588
[indistinct chatter]

13:24.060 --> 13:25.592
All right, sorry, folks.

13:25.594 --> 13:27.995
We'll, uh, we'll get
that gas leak fixed up,

13:27.997 --> 13:30.240
and we'll be back tomorrow
with two-for-one hurricanes.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.899
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

13:31.901 --> 13:34.501
Great. Please don't steal glasses.

13:38.140 --> 13:41.341
[exhales]

13:41.343 --> 13:43.110
Everyone's out.

13:43.112 --> 13:44.945
- Place is yours.
- See?

13:44.947 --> 13:47.609
Wasn't that easier than us
having to try to kill everyone?

13:47.612 --> 13:48.882
Yeah.

13:48.884 --> 13:50.213
So, what now?

13:50.216 --> 13:52.405
Would you be so kind as
to move that freezer unit,

13:52.408 --> 13:54.487
so that we might be able
to access the tunnels?

13:56.125 --> 13:57.558
Time's ticking, Josh.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.725
Go on.

14:01.730 --> 14:04.398
Are you absolutely certain
we're looking in the right place?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.567
We know this tunnel runs
the length of the city.

14:06.569 --> 14:08.316
Marcel must've carved
out a section to serve

14:08.319 --> 14:09.473
as his personal dungeon.

14:09.476 --> 14:12.636
Ingenious and sadistic.
Well done, Marcel.

14:12.639 --> 14:14.608
Save the compliments for
when he comes to kill us.

14:14.610 --> 14:16.510
Your flattery might give him pause.

14:16.512 --> 14:18.378
Okay, you're all set here.

14:18.381 --> 14:22.239
So, uh, good luck, break a
leg, and I'll just be on my way.

14:22.241 --> 14:24.858
What, so you can rat us out
to Marcel? Not bloody likely.

14:24.861 --> 14:27.187
Oh, just snap his neck. We'll
be done by the time he wakes.

14:27.189 --> 14:28.530
And if he wakes before that?

14:28.533 --> 14:30.858
- Then kill him.
- I'm right here, guys.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.159
We're not killing him.

14:32.161 --> 14:33.660
Yeah, you're probably right.

14:33.662 --> 14:35.295
For some reason, he's
of value to Marcel.

14:35.297 --> 14:36.930
- Kol, would you...?
- Happy to stay

14:36.932 --> 14:38.365
and have a drink and eviscerate

14:38.367 --> 14:39.600
anyone who tries to follow you.

14:39.602 --> 14:40.701
Good, then let's go.

14:40.703 --> 14:41.735
We're wasting time.

14:41.737 --> 14:42.798
Splendid.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.410
If you want to be free,
just pull out that blade.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.380
Mikael could do it.

14:53.382 --> 14:55.115
Do not invoke his name.

14:55.117 --> 14:57.050
Fine.

14:57.052 --> 14:59.686
What about your daughter's?

14:59.688 --> 15:01.121
Hope?

15:01.123 --> 15:03.924
She's out there right now.

15:03.926 --> 15:08.061
A fact that weighs upon me
every second I'm in this hole.

15:08.063 --> 15:11.632
But... I can't.

15:11.634 --> 15:13.200
Can't or won't?

15:14.503 --> 15:16.737
For five years, you had to stay put.

15:16.739 --> 15:18.172
In order to keep your family alive,

15:18.174 --> 15:19.406
you had to keep yourself alive.

15:19.408 --> 15:20.841
No matter what the pain

15:20.843 --> 15:22.609
or fear or solitude.

15:22.611 --> 15:25.879
But now you <i>can</i> leave,
and you choose to stay

15:25.881 --> 15:27.581
even though your
daughter's waiting for you.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.883
That makes me think that
blade's not your problem.

15:31.051 --> 15:32.350
Do you want to hear my theory?

15:32.353 --> 15:33.853
I'm sure you're going to tell me.

15:36.358 --> 15:38.425
I think you're afraid to see her.

15:38.427 --> 15:40.093
Now that she's old enough,

15:40.095 --> 15:41.328
she can see you.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.596
What if she sees you as a monster

15:42.598 --> 15:43.797
and hates you for it?

15:45.367 --> 15:48.268
When I see my daughter,

15:48.270 --> 15:51.672
she will run into my arms.

15:51.674 --> 15:56.009
She will look at me and
know that I love her.

15:56.011 --> 15:58.178
I would do anything for her.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.980
That's what every father says.

15:59.982 --> 16:01.848
But in a day-to-day,

16:01.850 --> 16:03.283
what if when she gets
in a fight with a friend?

16:03.285 --> 16:04.551
When someone breaks her heart?

16:04.553 --> 16:06.587
I will kill anyone that harms her.

16:06.589 --> 16:07.821
Oh, lovely.

16:07.823 --> 16:10.090
Then, instead of hating your darkness,

16:10.092 --> 16:12.626
she'll learn by example and
become a monster herself.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.263
Is that what you fear?

16:16.265 --> 16:17.864
You don't want her to fall

16:17.866 --> 16:19.566
into that cycle of violence.

16:19.568 --> 16:21.468
And your fear is eating
away at your strength.

16:21.470 --> 16:22.769
And that's why you can't free yourself.

16:22.771 --> 16:26.740
Okay, I have had
enough of this nonsense!

16:26.742 --> 16:29.443
Klaus, admit it.

16:29.445 --> 16:31.979
Down here, you can't hurt her.

16:31.981 --> 16:33.213
You're just a myth.

16:33.215 --> 16:35.215
This great man who sacrificed

16:35.217 --> 16:37.484
himself to save his family,
but in reality you...

16:37.486 --> 16:39.249
In reality, I would not be subjected

16:39.252 --> 16:40.918
to the ridiculous claims of a woman

16:40.921 --> 16:42.390
who died in my arms!

16:44.226 --> 16:46.960
I conjured you, so I can send you away.

16:48.397 --> 16:50.297
Go!

17:01.603 --> 17:04.243
You want to talk about right and wrong?

17:04.246 --> 17:07.948
Your brother killed me in cold
blood and you defended him.

17:07.950 --> 17:10.684
Davina... Davina,

17:10.685 --> 17:13.686
the girl who was like a
daughter to me, was lost forever,

17:13.689 --> 17:15.411
and the only thing
that you could say was

17:15.414 --> 17:17.184
“they did what they needed to do”?

17:17.186 --> 17:18.692
That's all we knew how to do!

17:18.694 --> 17:21.317
Right or wrong, that's all my
family has done for 1,000 years.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.429
Oh, come on!

17:22.430 --> 17:24.147
Is that really your defense?

17:24.151 --> 17:26.165
I have no defense.

17:26.167 --> 17:28.268
I know exactly what I am.

17:28.270 --> 17:31.038
As I know that none of
us are innocent in this.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.806
Least of all you and me.

17:35.844 --> 17:38.111
I was a damn fool to ever love you.

17:38.113 --> 17:39.579
And I could say the same.

17:39.581 --> 17:40.847
Then we are done here.

17:42.206 --> 17:43.672
We most certainly are not.

17:46.055 --> 17:48.488
You gonna use that on me?

17:48.490 --> 17:52.292
Infect me with the same hex
that damn near destroyed you?

17:52.294 --> 17:54.061
I don't want to,

17:54.063 --> 17:55.783
but I will if I have to.

18:02.504 --> 18:05.046
[groaning]

18:05.048 --> 18:07.348
[panting]: Damn it.

18:07.350 --> 18:10.351
Camille. Camille!

18:10.353 --> 18:13.421
I'm here. But if you're
just gonna keep arguing...

18:13.423 --> 18:15.156
I need your help.

18:15.158 --> 18:17.492
I can't pull out that blade.

18:17.494 --> 18:21.196
Technically, I'm not
even really... here.

18:21.198 --> 18:23.898
You're the one who
has to face your fears.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.700
Fine.

18:25.702 --> 18:28.169
I will admit the truth.

18:28.171 --> 18:30.805
I do not wish to be the father I had,

18:30.807 --> 18:34.776
nor do I wish to be the father
Marcel has come to loathe.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.012
Perhaps I am better as a myth.

18:39.483 --> 18:43.718
And Hope is better off without me.

18:44.588 --> 18:46.621
Is that enough?

18:46.623 --> 18:47.922
Or do you want more?

18:47.924 --> 18:50.892
Are you satisfied?

18:56.199 --> 18:58.066
Every parent

18:58.068 --> 18:59.934
is afraid of screwing up.

18:59.936 --> 19:02.904
Well, at least the good ones are.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.273
But Hope needs you.

19:05.275 --> 19:06.508
Now more than ever.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.476
Hayley will protect her.

19:08.478 --> 19:12.146
And she'll do one hell of a job.

19:12.148 --> 19:15.216
But don't you think
Hope deserves her father?

19:16.119 --> 19:19.487
Hey. Look at me.

19:19.489 --> 19:22.490
Yes, history could repeat itself.

19:22.492 --> 19:25.593
If you're not careful, it will.

19:25.595 --> 19:30.632
But you owe it to your daughter
to try and change the narrative.

19:30.634 --> 19:33.268
For her and for you.

19:36.439 --> 19:38.406
What?

19:38.408 --> 19:42.010
So this is why you brought me here, huh?

19:42.012 --> 19:43.711
So you could stake me?

19:43.713 --> 19:45.947
You had every chance
to do the right thing.

19:45.949 --> 19:48.349
The right thing?

19:48.351 --> 19:50.618
The right thing according to who?

19:50.620 --> 19:51.886
You?

19:51.888 --> 19:53.955
Or your family?

19:57.694 --> 20:01.329
This isn't about you
and me at all, is it?

20:01.331 --> 20:03.464
This is about Klaus.

20:03.466 --> 20:05.867
Elijah and the others are on their way

20:05.869 --> 20:07.835
to rescue him right now, right?

20:07.837 --> 20:09.737
And your job is to, what, hmm,

20:09.739 --> 20:11.606
keep me here, no matter what?

20:12.609 --> 20:14.142
Let it go.

20:14.144 --> 20:15.456
All right? It's over.

20:15.459 --> 20:16.725
It will never be over.

20:16.728 --> 20:17.993
You will never know peace,

20:17.996 --> 20:19.429
not a day in your life,

20:19.432 --> 20:21.261
so long as you hold my brother captive.

20:21.264 --> 20:22.650
We will stop at nothing...

20:22.652 --> 20:25.053
[arrows thumping]

20:25.055 --> 20:26.287
[gasping]

20:28.224 --> 20:29.657
Sorry to interrupt.

20:29.659 --> 20:33.895
Though, in fairness,
she does talk a lot.

20:33.897 --> 20:35.630
Should I drop her in the Gulf?

20:35.632 --> 20:37.999
Nobody lays a finger on her.

20:38.001 --> 20:39.334
Keep her here.

20:39.336 --> 20:41.336
All right, I'll be back soon.

20:41.338 --> 20:43.705
I just have to go kill her brother.

20:44.941 --> 20:46.741
Niklaus!

20:46.743 --> 20:49.177
[panting]

20:49.179 --> 20:51.245
Brother.

20:52.282 --> 20:53.915
Let me.

20:56.176 --> 20:57.719
[creaking]

21:02.566 --> 21:03.860
Niklaus.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.229
