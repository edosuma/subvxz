It's not fair.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.840
Uh, it's not fair to me or to Dion, and...

11:59.552 --> 12:03.097
[Dion] Oh, man. Boards on my window?
It's like I'm in jail.

[drill whirring]

12:54.982 --> 12:56.192
We have to go home.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.821
I'm sorry, honey, but you can't.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.658
Esperanza won't answer my texts.
She'll be there.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.578
-I can say "I'm sorry" in person.
-No, honey.

13:07.661 --> 13:08.954
[whirring]

13:09.872 --> 13:11.040
And I wanna talk to Pat.

13:11.123 --> 13:11.957
[whirring]

13:12.583 --> 13:14.376
Pat and I had a disagreement.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.753
About what?

13:16.378 --> 13:17.213
Um...

13:18.756 --> 13:21.050
Do you know what boundaries are?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.177
Like in dodgeball?

13:23.594 --> 13:24.428
Sort of.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.432
Um, but people
have all kinds of boundaries,

13:29.058 --> 13:31.227
and when someone doesn't want something,

13:31.936 --> 13:32.978
you have to listen.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.357
Okay? It's called
respecting people's boundaries.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.775
What did Pat do wrong?

13:39.401 --> 13:42.738
He wanted a different kind
of relationship with me than I wanted.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.407
Ugh, like a kissing kind of relationship?

13:45.491 --> 13:46.909
-Ugh!
-[Nicole chuckles]

13:46.992 --> 13:48.035
The point is...

13:48.369 --> 13:49.453
is that I said no.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.622
And he didn't listen.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.750
He thought he knew
what was better for me than I did.

13:59.755 --> 14:00.589
What's wrong?

14:01.006 --> 14:04.301
I think I didn't respect
Esperanza's boundaries.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.054
Okay, what happened?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.682
I lifted her up out of her chair
with magic.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.517
Why?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.103
I thought she'd like it,
but she got really angry.

14:15.813 --> 14:20.025
[sighs] Well, did she ever talk
about wanting to come out of her chair?

14:20.609 --> 14:24.697
No, but Jonathan is good at drawing,
like she is,

14:24.780 --> 14:26.407
and they play Zelda,

14:26.490 --> 14:28.033
but she was my friend first.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.952
Oh, Bug.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.954
I'm going home.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.205
No, we can't.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.623
I'm going home!

14:35.416 --> 14:37.710
Dion! I didn't know
you could still do that.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.669
Me neither!

14:41.463 --> 14:42.423
Stop.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.426
I'm not gonna let my friends down,
or Jonathan.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.136
Abracadabra!

14:47.219 --> 14:48.178
Do not teleport.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.390
[Dion] Ugh, not my room.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.017
Di...

14:53.100 --> 14:54.852
Bug, you're going the wrong way.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.230
[door opens]

15:08.949 --> 15:11.160
I think Pinchy's
a little worried about you.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.496
Charlotte lied.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.082
About what?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.712
She said I'd be able to teleport
if I really needed to.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.422
You just did.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.592
Not to where I want to go.

15:28.093 --> 15:33.098
You will make things right with Esperanza
as soon as you get back.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.851
I promise.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.025
[wind howling]

15:43.108 --> 15:44.944
[shutters clattering]

15:55.162 --> 15:56.246
I'll be right back.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.386

17:18.120 --> 17:19.163
-Hey.
-[gasps]

17:20.164 --> 17:21.123
Are you guys okay?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.376
What did-- What are you doing here?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.838
Uh, Dion, asked me to come. See?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.215
But the storm. Did you--

17:30.966 --> 17:32.301
You didn't drive here.
I didn't see your car.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.552
[stammers] How did you get here?

17:33.635 --> 17:36.764
Did you board these windows yourself?
Because that's a-- That was a good job.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.308
-It must have taken you all night. Dion!
-Hey, stay right there.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.225
Ah!

17:41.226 --> 17:42.352
[exhales]

17:43.187 --> 17:45.689
Those are the same things
that were on the fox.

17:45.773 --> 17:49.026
-Are you sick? Is that why you're here?
-No, no, no, no, no. Um...

17:49.234 --> 17:51.737
I'm here because you weren't
answering my calls,

17:51.820 --> 17:52.696
or my texts.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.614
You...

17:54.031 --> 17:54.990
you cut me out.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.076
Get out of my house.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.577
No, I need to talk to Dion.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.579
-Dion!
-Hey, I said no.

18:00.996 --> 18:01.830
[yelps]

18:02.581 --> 18:03.415
Dion!

18:03.999 --> 18:05.167
No. Dion.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.337
[pants]

18:08.420 --> 18:09.254
[gasps]

18:09.671 --> 18:10.506
[pants]

18:12.549 --> 18:13.467
[chuckles]

18:14.384 --> 18:15.219
Yes!

18:18.931 --> 18:19.973
Buddy!

18:20.432 --> 18:22.059
Whoa, you must be tired.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.442
Dion, where are you?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.945
[coughing]

18:33.570 --> 18:34.404
[Nicole] Dion!

18:35.823 --> 18:37.491
He did it. Wow.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.284
That is amazing.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.372
You think that Dion can heal you
like he healed that fox?

18:43.455 --> 18:46.583
That's why he was in the hospital.
You made him try to heal you!

18:46.667 --> 18:49.336
[yells] Hey! I didn't do anything.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.505
He wanted to help me because he loves me.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.257
And I love him.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.510
And I love you.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.973
But you had to go and screw
that whole thing up for everybody.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.768
But you're not gonna hurt him, are you?

19:04.852 --> 19:05.686
Nicole.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.690
Do you... do you have any idea

19:10.149 --> 19:11.567
how much pain I am in?

19:12.901 --> 19:14.570
How close I've been to dying?

19:14.653 --> 19:17.739
The thing that gave everybody else powers
is eating me alive.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.200
And then Dion comes along
and he can fix it all.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.410
But it would kill him.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.536
Which is...

19:23.328 --> 19:25.247
why I never asked him to heal me.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.040
Okay? I wanted us to be a family.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.003
I-I-I would have gone on
absorbing other powered people.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.838
-Oh, no. God.
-Until I ran out of them.

19:32.921 --> 19:33.755
You...

19:34.298 --> 19:35.132
killed Mark.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.049
Oh, my God.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.303
He should have told me
he was going to New Orleans!

19:39.386 --> 19:42.055
Suddenly, he was there,
and I couldn't stop.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.223
[groans]

19:43.307 --> 19:44.600
-Hey.
-I couldn't stop.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.476
-Just-- Let's, um...
-Oh, God.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.770
What do you want?
I mean, how do we... how do we fix this?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.647
-No.
-There's a way to do it.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.648
-No, no, no.
-There--

19:51.732 --> 19:53.233
No, no, no, no. You made your choice.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.195
And so now I'm gonna do
what I need to do to survive.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.658
-You can't have him!
-[groans]

[panicked breathing]

20:29.478 --> 20:31.480
[fire crackling]

21:21.363 --> 21:22.239
[Brett] Hmm.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.617
I'm reporting you.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.662
Do what you've gotta do, man.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.247
I have early classes.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.250
[sighs] Then you'd best get to bed.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.252
You've been drinking?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.504
-Come from a party?
-[inhales]

21:37.587 --> 21:38.588
[sighs]

21:38.672 --> 21:40.048
Get out of my face, Brett.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.760
It's none of your business what I did
before I came to work,

21:44.177 --> 21:46.179
-what I do after work...
-[man shushing]

22:04.614 --> 22:06.116
You have too many books out.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.037
I'm sorry, what?

22:10.537 --> 22:12.039
The maximum is four.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.582
And you have...

22:14.333 --> 22:16.126
-Six.
-Six.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.378
[scoffs] Yeah, but nobody's in here.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.630
Rules are rules. I enforce the rules.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.257
[Mark] Hm.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.592
How was the party?

22:24.801 --> 22:26.845
-Hmm?
-That is why you're late, right?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.388
How do you know that I'm late?

22:28.472 --> 22:31.391
Because your shift starts at 1:00.
It's a little past 3:00.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.770
I'm here a lot. You're late a lot.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.024
-[scoffs] What, are you stalking me or...?
-No, ma'am.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.110
I'm stalking education and knowledge.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.698
Hmm. I need coffee.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.284
I like mine with two sugars. Thank you.

22:52.746 --> 22:53.872
I'm not a waitress.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.543
Except at my other job,
where I'm a waitress.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.380
That's a lot of jobs. Why so many?

23:03.298 --> 23:05.675
Maybe my dad didn't want to pay
for a dance major.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.469
Mmm. I see, I see.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.055
Well, I mean, we can get him on the phone.
I'll talk to him.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.224
[laughs] And what would you say to him?

23:12.307 --> 23:13.350
Shh...

23:13.683 --> 23:15.227
Stop shushing me.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.686
Okay, well, come down here.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.480
Come on.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.484
Okay, smart-ass,
what would you say to him?

23:23.985 --> 23:26.530
I mean, I'd tell him that art education

23:26.613 --> 23:31.493
is just as important as math or science.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.162
Yeah?

23:35.205 --> 23:36.039
Yeah.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.042
What's your name?

23:39.626 --> 23:40.460
Mark.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.338
It improves critical thinking,

23:43.588 --> 23:45.090
encourages innovation,

23:45.173 --> 23:48.135
and strengthens your connection
with community.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.221
I'm Nicole.

23:54.141 --> 23:54.975
I know.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.940
So, let's call your dad.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.942
-[Nicole chuckles]
-That'd be fun.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.944

Dion!

24:57.871 --> 24:59.581
[children chattering indistinctly]

25:04.461 --> 25:07.964
Jonathan, you have to present this stuff
in a couple of minutes!

25:08.048 --> 25:09.674
You said I wouldn't have to talk.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.843
That was before Dion bailed.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.263
Why is that can of liquid nitrogen
so small?

25:15.347 --> 25:19.392
It's the biggest one I could get online
without a driver's license, okay?

25:19.476 --> 25:21.811
-I'm here, I'm here.
-I don't have to talk?

25:21.895 --> 25:25.524
I'm sorry for bailing on you
and for being jealous of you and Jonathan.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.983
Wait, what?

25:27.150 --> 25:29.486
And for trying to fix you
when you aren't broken.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.363
You're the best friend
anybody could ask for.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.199
So please, please,
let me back into the group,

25:34.282 --> 25:36.785
and I won't let you down again, I promise.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.295
You're making it weird.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.672
I know.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.591
You gonna remember your speech?

25:52.759 --> 25:54.261
Are you gonna remember yours?

25:54.803 --> 25:56.471
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.183
Okay, guys, let's get out there
and do some great work.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.311
[all] Go, Storm Killer!

26:03.395 --> 26:04.479
[tires squeal]

26:11.987 --> 26:13.780
[woman] <i>BIONA Technologies,</i>
<i>how can I help you?</i>

26:13.863 --> 26:17.242
-I need to speak to Suzanne Wu, please.
-[woman] <i>One moment, please.</i>

26:19.286 --> 26:21.329
-[Suzanne] <i>Hello.</i>
-It's Pat. Pat Rollins.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.374
-Nicole, is that you?
-He-- He's the storm! Pat is the storm!

26:24.457 --> 26:27.669
-Wait. What? What are you talking about?
-[Nicole] <i>Pat Rollins.</i>

26:27.752 --> 26:30.005
<i>He turned into a cyclone</i>
<i>right in front of me,</i>

26:30.088 --> 26:31.881
<i>and he's trying to kill Dion!</i>

26:32.382 --> 26:34.551
If he wanted to kill Dion,
he would have done it by now.

26:34.634 --> 26:38.471
<i>No, listen. He needs Dion to heal him,</i>
<i>like he healed the fox.</i>

26:38.555 --> 26:40.056
And killing him won't do that.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.852
He needs Dion to want to heal him.

26:43.935 --> 26:46.313
[stammers] And I need you
to get to Dion's school

26:46.396 --> 26:48.273
and stop Pat from getting to him.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.151
Uh, okay, but how do you--

26:51.234 --> 26:53.194
All the stuff that you do at BIONA,

26:53.278 --> 26:56.072
I need you to throw it at him
and save my son. Do you hear me?

26:56.573 --> 26:57.699
Yeah, yeah, I will.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.534
I will.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.019

27:28.229 --> 27:29.856
Is the science fair this way? Thank you.

27:29.939 --> 27:30.857
[inhales sharply]

27:31.316 --> 27:32.150
Hello.

[children chattering indistinctly]

27:51.753 --> 27:53.254
-[Pat] Hey.
-Pat!

27:53.338 --> 27:54.464
Hey, buddy.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.716
[Pat exhales]

27:56.800 --> 27:59.886
Uh, can I use your phone?
I got into a fight with my mom.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.012
Uh...

28:01.262 --> 28:03.139
I know. She, uh... she told me.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.557
Is she mad?

28:04.766 --> 28:08.436
No. No, no, no. She just, um...
she just wants to know you're okay.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.607
She told me to take you home,
and, uh, she'll meet us there, all right?

28:13.066 --> 28:14.859
I have to do my project first.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.779
Well, she was pretty worried. I think...

28:17.862 --> 28:20.281
I think, actually, we should probably
just go now, you know?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.534
This is gonna get us all
into the gifted program.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.036
Even Jonathan. I can't let him down.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.287
[nervous chuckle] Um...

28:26.955 --> 28:27.789
Well...

28:28.248 --> 28:29.833
[groans] Your mom was, uh, pretty--

28:29.916 --> 28:32.669
No! I made a promise. I'm not leaving.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.337
Okay. [inhales]

28:34.421 --> 28:35.880
Um... [exhales]

28:36.381 --> 28:37.215
[sniffs]

28:38.007 --> 28:39.217
But, um...

28:40.510 --> 28:43.805
[stammers] I do have to talk to you
about something. It's really important.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.766
Can you just... [inhales]
come with me for one second?

28:46.850 --> 28:48.560
It'll take a minute
and you'll be right back.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.228
Okay.

28:50.603 --> 28:51.563
I'll be right back.

[Pat grunts]

29:00.905 --> 29:01.740
Hey.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.663
Okay, listen.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.331
So...

29:10.415 --> 29:11.249
[sniffs]

29:11.332 --> 29:13.501
I need you to do something for me.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.253
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.339
I need you to heal me...

29:19.090 --> 29:20.633
like you healed that fox.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.343
But won't that make me sick?

29:22.844 --> 29:23.970
Uh, it--

29:25.013 --> 29:26.681
It might. It might, but...

29:27.599 --> 29:30.810
but we know how
to make you better now, right? [coughs]

29:31.853 --> 29:34.230
So, is it your head again, or...?

29:34.314 --> 29:35.398
[sighs] Uh...

29:36.483 --> 29:38.693
[sniffs] Here's the thing, buddy. Um...

29:38.777 --> 29:41.529
I... I am sicker than I told you.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.447
Um...

29:43.698 --> 29:45.200
I... [sighs]

29:45.992 --> 29:47.076
-I'm dying.
-No!

29:47.160 --> 29:50.538
Dion, no, but you can save me.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.792
So, will you do that for me?

29:54.751 --> 29:55.585
Please.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.757
Can I ask my mom?

30:01.466 --> 30:03.009
[exhales shakily] Uh...

30:03.092 --> 30:03.927
[inhales]

30:04.010 --> 30:06.137
No, um, she's...

30:06.221 --> 30:07.055
[exhales]

30:07.347 --> 30:09.474
She's not here,
and I don't have a lot of time, Di,

30:09.557 --> 30:11.184
so I need you to do it right now.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.521
You're a superhero, right?

30:15.104 --> 30:16.606
Superheroes save people.

30:17.690 --> 30:21.694
So now is your chance
to be a real-life superhero.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.241
Please, Dion.

30:26.866 --> 30:27.951
You're my only hope.

30:33.039 --> 30:33.873
[Pat exhales]

[Dion grunts]

30:44.592 --> 30:45.426
Dion?

30:48.012 --> 30:48.847
Dion?

30:51.349 --> 30:52.517
Hey, Esperanza.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.394
Do you know where Dion is?

30:54.811 --> 30:56.688
He went down there with his mentor.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.315
Oh, my God.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.442
We've gotta get down there.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.027
-Let's go.
-Okay.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.530
-[Dion grunts]
-Dion!

31:05.613 --> 31:07.073
-Stop!
-I'm helping Pat.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.241
No!

31:08.616 --> 31:09.617
No, stop it!

31:10.159 --> 31:12.370
-Keep going, Dion.
-He's gonna die.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.205
-No, he's killing you!
-He's my friend!

31:14.289 --> 31:15.915
He is the Crooked Man!

31:17.208 --> 31:19.836
He killed your father.
He just tried to kill me.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.422
You're just mad
because he tried to kiss you!

31:22.505 --> 31:23.339
No.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.009
Hey, it's you and me.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.804
You and me, okay? You gotta trust me.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.890

31:36.394 --> 31:38.104
[Nicole yelps] No!

31:38.521 --> 31:39.564
No!

31:39.647 --> 31:43.151
-Dion, run!
-Hey! Dion, finish what you started.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.236
What are you doing? Let go of her!

31:45.320 --> 31:48.072
You've gotta finish healing me
or I'm gonna hurt your mom, okay?

31:48.156 --> 31:49.532
Dion, run!

31:49.616 --> 31:52.535
Finish healing me,
or I'm gonna have to kill her.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.453
[grunts]

31:53.536 --> 31:56.331
-Dion! Do it now.
-[Nicole] No!

31:58.124 --> 32:00.126
-[Nicole coughs]
-He's sick, Mom.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.085
I can help him.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.295
-[groans] Oh!
-[Dion] Stop!

32:02.378 --> 32:04.297
If I heal him, he won't be evil anymore.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.966
-That's my buddy.
-Please, Dion. Don't!

Go! Go!

32:54.430 --> 32:55.264
It's coming!

32:59.769 --> 33:00.979
-Hurry!
-It's real.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.063
Come on, Dion.

33:02.855 --> 33:03.731
Come on, Esperanza.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.149
-Try the other one.
-Go in there.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.820

-Go!
-Come on. Come on, come on.

-Let's go.
-In here!

33:33.678 --> 33:36.597
-Hey, stay in here.
-No, come with us!

33:37.181 --> 33:38.516
That was insane!

33:38.599 --> 33:41.519
Yeah, next time we better bring
a storm surge or something.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.229
-What are you doing?
-Making armor.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.148
Why? We're safe in here, right?

33:45.231 --> 33:46.524
-[Dion] He wants me.
-Why?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.651
I'm going out there
before he hurts my mom.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.486
-Dion, are you nuts?
-[Esperanza] No, Dion!

33:50.570 --> 33:54.073
-Stay in here until it goes away.
-It won't go away. I have to face it.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.951
-[Esperanza] But--
-Esperanza, he killed my dad.

-[Suzanne] Get the compressor!
-Hey! What's the plan?

34:09.088 --> 34:11.716
We're gonna boost liquid nitrogen
up and over the center of the storm

34:11.799 --> 34:13.176
and cool it down, try to weaken it.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.636
-That's Dion's science project.
-We thought of it first.

34:16.012 --> 34:19.015

to that thing.

-He knocked me out.
-By accident.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.987

He sees Dion,
but for whatever reason, you're invisible.

35:33.422 --> 35:36.008
It's because I don't have powers.
He can only see powered people.

35:36.425 --> 35:37.260
Will this work?
