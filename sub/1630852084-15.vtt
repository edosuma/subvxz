00:00.868 --> 00:01.935

- You know I'm gonna kill
you, right?

00:02.035 --> 00:03.370

- If you kill me,
I'm gonna kill you back.

00:03.470 --> 00:04.972

- Why did you do that?
- Because you shouldn't

00:05.072 --> 00:06.306
have gotten in the car
with him.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.008
- LEAH: I can't believe
she would do what she did.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.309
- You should let me punch
him one time.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.078
- Punch me in my face, please.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.212
- LEAH: She is grounded.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.580
- I'm not grounded.
- Yes, you are.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.748
- Well, I'm going out again.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.250
- PHILIP: You better not leave.
- Watch me.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.951
- Hold me, Cora.
- Well, let him go, Cora!

00:18.051 --> 00:19.553
- Stop!
- Don't tell me to stop it.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.622
What you need to be worried
about is that little

00:21.722 --> 00:24.291
fast daughter of yours.
- What are you talking about?

00:24.391 --> 00:27.127
- She snuck out with that boy.
- Did she leave?

00:27.227 --> 00:29.730
- That's what the hell I've been
telling you!

00:29.830 --> 00:30.097
- ♪

00:32.241 --> 00:34.009
- Ooh, Cora.
- Huh?

00:34.109 --> 00:37.313
- Oh, I had to go and let some
of that water go.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.882
Done had me fulled up.
- Well--

00:39.982 --> 00:41.350
well, you drunk enough.
- I did.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.452
- Are they back yet?
- Cora,

00:43.552 --> 00:44.920
that girl in trouble.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.622
- Well, she should be in
trouble, Mr. Brown.

00:46.722 --> 00:50.025
- Yeah, her little fast tail.
- Now don't say that.

00:50.125 --> 00:52.428
- What? She just left out of
here with that boy.

00:52.528 --> 00:57.132
Well, technically,
he's "a man."

00:57.232 --> 00:59.368
- Well, she is a teenager,
and she will learn.

00:59.468 --> 01:00.869
- Yeah, but if she
was my daughter--

01:00.970 --> 01:02.438
- What would you do?

01:02.538 --> 01:05.007
- I'd make her walk around
with an X on her chest.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.176
- [laughing]

01:07.276 --> 01:09.011
You mean--you mean an A.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.246
- An A? What, um--why--

01:10.346 --> 01:12.081
- For "The Scarlet Letter."

01:12.181 --> 01:15.351
- Cora, who is Scarlet?

01:15.451 --> 01:16.452
- Mr. Brown.

01:16.552 --> 01:17.686
- And why would Scarlet be
walking around

01:17.786 --> 01:19.221
with an A on her chest?

01:19.321 --> 01:22.324
She should be walking around
with an S.

01:22.424 --> 01:23.759
- Why S?

01:23.859 --> 01:27.096
- Duh, think, Cora, think.

01:27.196 --> 01:30.032
- What?
- Scarlet, the letter.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.535
You don't know your ABCs?

01:33.636 --> 01:35.938
Ooh, you're a teacher?

01:36.038 --> 01:37.406
- Never mind, Mr. Brown.

01:37.506 --> 01:39.608
- That girl would be
in so much trouble,

01:39.708 --> 01:40.976
if that was you.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.144
- I would have never done that,

01:42.244 --> 01:43.545
because Madea
would've killed me.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.047
- You know before your mama
started stripping,

01:45.147 --> 01:48.183
she was a bouncer, right?

01:48.284 --> 01:50.686
And one day, one of the girls
didn't come in,

01:50.786 --> 01:54.757
and then they said, "Madea, you
gonna have to start stripping."

01:54.857 --> 01:56.425
- What?
- Yes!

01:56.525 --> 01:58.227
And she went up there on
that pole,

01:58.327 --> 02:00.696
her first day was a disaster.

02:00.796 --> 02:03.532
she climbed up that pole,
and she was so big,

02:03.632 --> 02:07.703
the thing tilted, it had her on
like antenna on the thing.

02:07.803 --> 02:08.971
- Stop--
- She was just waving,

02:09.071 --> 02:11.540
swaying around, Cora, it--
- Stop talking about her.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.409
- You know how your mama
used to end her show?

02:13.509 --> 02:14.843
- What?
- She would sprinkle

02:14.944 --> 02:17.246
some
gold dust in her butt cheeks,

02:17.346 --> 02:18.581
and she'd make 'em clap,

02:18.681 --> 02:22.251
and dust would go
all over the audience!

02:22.351 --> 02:24.219
- Okay, that's enough,
Mr. Brown.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.055
- But if that lil' girl was
Mabel's daughter,

02:26.188 --> 02:29.024
she'd be in a casket
or a cast.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.426
- Well, I hope they find her.

02:30.526 --> 02:33.295
- Me, too. But if they don't
find her,

02:33.395 --> 02:36.632
we can still use
that insurance money.

02:36.732 --> 02:38.200
- Why would you say
something like that?

02:38.300 --> 02:41.136
- Well, if they don't find
her, they don't find her.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.538
- You want 'em to find her.

02:44.573 --> 02:45.674

my show is about?

03:56.729 --> 03:59.131

- My show is about this girl

03:59.231 --> 04:01.400
who was going to school one day,

04:01.500 --> 04:04.536
and a van with no windows,
no nothing, the way to get out,

04:04.636 --> 04:07.072
and the van man snatched her
up in the van,

04:07.172 --> 04:09.241
and took the little girl away,
Cora!

04:09.341 --> 04:10.909
- Why are you doing that?

04:11.010 --> 04:12.077
- What? She was trafficked.

04:12.177 --> 04:15.047
She could have been
trafficked.

04:15.147 --> 04:16.382
- Mr.--
- Cora, do you know they try

04:16.482 --> 04:17.650
to traffic me one day.
- Mr. Brown.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.051
They tried to traffic you?
- Somebody was trying

04:19.151 --> 04:21.186
to sex traffic me.

04:21.286 --> 04:22.488
- What were they gonna do
with you?

04:22.588 --> 04:24.256
- MR. BROWN: They tried--
- Oh, my Lord.

04:24.356 --> 04:25.424
Don't worry about him.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.326
He ain't gonna never learn.

- He's stupid.
- You're stupid.

04:29.928 --> 04:31.764
- No, you're the one--
- Okay, y'all don't start that.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.265
I thought you asleep.

04:33.365 --> 04:34.633

04:34.733 --> 04:36.568
- Not too worried, you let
her go.

04:36.669 --> 04:39.905
- Well, I was distracted by
the loss of my weed!

04:40.005 --> 04:41.140
- Ah, get over that.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.243
That stuff out there wasn't

- I will.

04:47.513 --> 04:48.914

- Would you two stop it?

04:51.283 --> 04:52.785
Sit down!

04:52.918 --> 04:54.787

04:56.121 --> 04:58.090
See? Look. I can't--
Cora, look at me.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.925

05:00.025 --> 05:03.295
Mr. Vinny, do you have
any idea where she could go?

05:03.395 --> 05:07.299
- No, I don't have any idea
where she could go.

05:07.399 --> 05:08.734
- Stop that, this is not
the time, alright?

05:08.867 --> 05:10.035
- Oh, man.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.670
- Well, maybe you could
call his daddy.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.173
- The sheriff?
- Yes, the sheriff.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.375
- Ah, no, we can't do that.
- Why not?

05:16.475 --> 05:19.411
- Yeah, because I got all this
stuff in the back--ah, that fool

05:19.511 --> 05:23.182
done cut it down, I don't
even have nothing now.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.551
- Now--what--well--okay, well,
what is his number?

05:25.651 --> 05:26.719

05:26.885 --> 05:29.355
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.357
- Cora, you mean to tell me
y'all don't know the number

05:31.457 --> 05:32.591
to dial the police?

05:32.691 --> 05:34.293
Y'all just dumb and
"clu-able."

05:34.393 --> 05:35.661

you mean dumb?

05:35.761 --> 05:37.096
- Everybody in the world know
the number

05:37.196 --> 05:38.931
to dial the police is 911.

05:39.031 --> 05:42.768
- Mr. Brown, you cannot
call 911 for a non-emergency.

05:42.901 --> 05:43.635
- Why not?

05:43.736 --> 05:45.404
- 'Cause it wouldn't be good.

05:45.504 --> 05:47.039
- Well, what you calling it for?

05:47.139 --> 05:50.342
- Right before I kill you
in a few minutes.

05:50.442 --> 05:52.211
- If you wanna murder somebody,
murder--

05:52.311 --> 05:53.579
- I've wanted to murder you
since you showed up.

05:53.679 --> 05:54.747
- Well, come on,
Murder She Wrote.

05:54.913 --> 05:56.382
- --she will kill.
- Well, if you wanna do.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.651
- Hey, will y'all please calm--
you sit down,

05:58.751 --> 06:00.619
and don't get back up.
- Cora, I think you broke

06:00.719 --> 06:02.621
my tibia.

06:02.721 --> 06:04.757
Look, now--now, do you know
the number?

06:04.857 --> 06:07.459
- Hmm-mm. No.
- Well, let me look it up.

06:07.559 --> 06:09.361
- Oh, no, Cora, I'mma look
it up in the Yellow Pages.

06:09.461 --> 06:11.397
- Mr. Brown, don't nobody use
the Yellow Pages no more.

06:11.497 --> 06:14.767
- The devil is a liar.
I use the Yellow Pages.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.402
- What are you gonna use
the Yellow Pages for?

06:16.502 --> 06:19.405
- For the numbers, that's
what I use it for.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.306
- Well, I could just look it up
on my phone.

06:21.407 --> 06:22.741
- Duh, I could find
the Yellow Pages.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.777
- Okay.
- Vinny, where the Yellow Pages?

06:24.877 --> 06:28.013
- Duh, I don't know.
Next to the White Pages.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.415
- Where the White Pages?

06:29.515 --> 06:32.785
- Damn it, I stopped using
the phonebook in 1978, man.

06:32.885 --> 06:34.219
- Ah, come on with
the cussing there,

06:34.320 --> 06:35.587
Mr. Vinny.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.524

06:46.498 --> 06:48.467

06:48.567 --> 06:51.236
- I'm gonna read your mind:
555-555--

06:51.337 --> 06:52.604
- Would you stop it?
- 7.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.773

- Okay.

06:59.345 --> 07:00.913

Yes, um, my name is

- Cora, Let me talk to him.

07:09.521 --> 07:11.890
I can get it out of him.
I can get it out of him.

07:11.991 --> 07:13.625
Let me talk to him.
- What are you doing?

07:13.726 --> 07:16.228
- Hello?
Yes.

07:16.328 --> 07:20.332
This is

07:20.432 --> 07:22.935
The F is for Finding little
girls that's been taken

07:23.035 --> 07:25.004
by the sheriff's son.

07:25.104 --> 07:27.339
You better tell us where
her body is, 'cause I'm coming.

07:27.439 --> 07:29.241
I have a unique set of skills.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.343
And I will hunt you down!
- Give me this!

07:31.443 --> 07:32.611
I'm so sorry, sir.

07:32.711 --> 07:34.780
I was trying to find this
baby--but is your son

07:34.880 --> 07:36.548
