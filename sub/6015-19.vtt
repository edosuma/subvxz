00:02.291 --> 00:03.644
The concept behind the car phone...

00:05.131 --> 00:07.281
...speakerphone, airline phone,
portable phone...

00:07.451 --> 00:09.487
...pay phone, cordless phone,
multiline phone...

00:09.651 --> 00:11.323
...the phone pager, the call waiting...

00:11.611 --> 00:15.490
...call forwarding, conferencing, speed
dialling, direct dialling and redialling...

00:15.651 --> 00:18.211
...is that we all have
absolutely nothing to say...

00:18.371 --> 00:21.329
...and we've got to talk to someone
about it right now.

00:21.491 --> 00:24.369
Cannot wait another second.

00:24.611 --> 00:26.363
You're at home, you're on the phone.

00:26.531 --> 00:27.725
You're in the car making calls.

00:27.891 --> 00:29.529
You get to work,
"Any messages for me?"

00:29.691 --> 00:34.003
You gotta give people
a chance to miss you a little!

00:38.531 --> 00:41.489
It's bad enough you have a car phone.
You have to use the speak er?

00:41.691 --> 00:45.604
It's safer. Plus, it's more annoying
to the other person.

00:46.531 --> 00:48.761
- Oh, look at this guy.
- What's going on?

00:48.931 --> 00:51.729
A guy's trying to get in front of me,
has to ask permission. Yes.

00:51.891 --> 00:53.961
Go ahead. Get in, get in.

00:54.891 --> 00:57.610
- Did you get a thank-you wave?
- No, nothing.

00:57.771 --> 00:59.443
How could you not
give a thank-you wave?

00:59.611 --> 01:02.569
Hey, buddy, where's
my thank-you wave?

01:03.011 --> 01:05.161
Give me that wave!

01:06.131 --> 01:08.770
- Hey, Jerry, are you free on Friday?
- Yeah, I'm free. Why?

01:08.931 --> 01:12.128
Oh, God. I bumped into
Robin Sandusky today.

01:12.291 --> 01:15.010
She asked me to have dinner
with her and her husband.

01:15.251 --> 01:16.889
Oh, my God.

01:17.051 --> 01:20.123
You won't believe what I saw.
A car just bashed into a parked car...

01:20.291 --> 01:22.043
...and sped off, right on my block.

01:22.971 --> 01:25.485
- You've got to follow that car.
- What?

01:25.651 --> 01:28.723
- You can't let him get away with that.
- The guy could be dangerous.

01:29.251 --> 01:32.766
- What are you, yellow?
- I'm not yellow.

01:34.291 --> 01:36.441
Jerry, if you don't follow him,
you're yellow.

01:36.611 --> 01:38.522
- Wait. He stopped. He's parking.
- What?

01:38.691 --> 01:40.443
What? I can't hear you. Jerry?

01:42.211 --> 01:43.803
Excuse me.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.565
I was driving behind you, you know...

01:46.731 --> 01:49.564
...a few blocks back, and l...
I couldn't...

01:49.731 --> 01:52.291
...help... Maybe you didn't realize l...

01:52.451 --> 01:54.521
l... I witnessed that...

01:55.571 --> 01:58.688
...your... Your left rear tire's
a little low.

01:58.851 --> 02:02.400
That can affect the performance
of the twin l-beam suspension...

02:02.571 --> 02:06.450
...not to mention, you know,
your rack-and-pinion steering.

02:10.491 --> 02:13.722
So I wound up going out
for a decaf cappuccino with her.

02:14.771 --> 02:16.682
Boy, what a story.

02:17.891 --> 02:20.200
I'm speechless, speechless.
I have no speech.

02:23.011 --> 02:25.571
You know, I really liked her.
We talked, we flirted.

02:25.731 --> 02:28.848
And when she laughed,
she'd reach out and touch my arm.

02:31.491 --> 02:34.005
Love when they touch your arm.
I can't get enough of that.

02:34.171 --> 02:35.968
- Me either.
- Why is that?

02:36.411 --> 02:38.686
Let's not even analyse it.

02:39.051 --> 02:41.724
- So you didn't turn her in.
- I couldn't go though with it.

02:41.891 --> 02:44.246
- You gonna see her again?
- Friday night.

02:44.971 --> 02:46.199
- Yeah.
- It's me.

02:46.371 --> 02:47.804
Come on up.

02:49.571 --> 02:52.529
By the way, Elaine does not
need to know about anything.

02:52.691 --> 02:54.807
Hey, hey, hey.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.883
I dig.

02:58.251 --> 02:59.889
- Oh, you dig?
- Yes.

03:00.051 --> 03:02.611
- I see enormous potential here.
- Why?

03:02.771 --> 03:06.320
Because great couples always have
a great story about how they met.

03:06.491 --> 03:08.800
That's why I've never been in
a long-term relationship.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.370
I never had a good meeting story.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.921
I wonder if I'm nuts
for pursuing this woman at all.

03:13.091 --> 03:14.285
I don't think so.

03:14.451 --> 03:16.681
Look, she slammed
into a parked car.

03:16.851 --> 03:20.048
She took no responsibility for
mutilating the property of a stranger...

03:20.211 --> 03:23.009
...and then she sped off
like a criminal.

03:24.051 --> 03:26.611
On the other hand...

03:26.771 --> 03:29.205
...should she never be
allowed to date again?

03:29.371 --> 03:32.010
Scratch one car and you're
forbidden to have social contact...

03:32.171 --> 03:34.207
...for the rest of your life?

03:35.331 --> 03:37.287
What am I drinking, milk?

03:39.211 --> 03:41.247
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:41.411 --> 03:42.605
- Sweater.
- Thank you.

03:42.771 --> 03:45.331
So? What happened?

03:45.491 --> 03:47.607
- With what?
- With the car.

03:47.771 --> 03:48.920
What car?

03:49.091 --> 03:50.285
The hit-and-run.

03:50.451 --> 03:54.205
Oh, right, right, right.

03:54.371 --> 03:55.565
Well...

03:55.731 --> 03:57.722
...actually, the guy
went into Queens.

03:58.291 --> 03:59.485
Queens?

03:59.651 --> 04:02.324
- You followed him over the bridge?
- Over the bridge.

04:02.491 --> 04:04.766
Oh, l... I didn't know you
went into Queens, Jerry.

04:05.251 --> 04:07.242
Yeah, Queens.

04:07.571 --> 04:09.402
So? Then what?

04:09.571 --> 04:13.723
He gets out of the car. I said,
"Hey, buddy, I saw you hit that car."

04:13.891 --> 04:15.483
So he says to me:

04:15.651 --> 04:17.687
"What are you gonna do about it?"

04:17.851 --> 04:20.728
So I said to him,
"Whatever's necessary."

04:23.931 --> 04:26.126
I am speechless.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.327
I am without speech.

04:29.331 --> 04:31.322
Tell her about the shoving.

04:34.371 --> 04:36.009
What?

04:37.131 --> 04:38.928
What shoving?

04:39.331 --> 04:41.561
- Oh, it was nothing.
- No.

04:41.731 --> 04:43.722
Tell her.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.884
Come on. Tell me.

04:46.051 --> 04:48.281
Well, he kind of lost his temper...

04:48.451 --> 04:50.919
...and he was pushing me
up against the car...

04:51.091 --> 04:53.810
...so I went into a karate stance.

04:56.931 --> 04:59.445
- You know karate?
- I know a little.

04:59.611 --> 05:02.683
Well, l... This is so amazing to me.

05:02.851 --> 05:04.648
Jerry, what did he do?

05:04.811 --> 05:06.688
He backed off.

05:06.971 --> 05:09.724
He was pretty pathetic, actually.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.083
Hey.

05:14.011 --> 05:15.922
- Did you tell Kramer?
- No.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.809
What, what? Tell me.

05:18.211 --> 05:21.647
Jerry saw this guy smash into a car,
and he followed him.

05:22.571 --> 05:24.368
Good for you.

05:24.611 --> 05:27.330
What kind of a sick lowlife
would do a thing like that?

05:27.491 --> 05:30.210
You know, those people,
you know they're mentally disturbed.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.202
They should be sent to Australia.

05:33.891 --> 05:35.449
- Australia?
- That's where England...

05:35.611 --> 05:37.090
...used to send their convicts.

05:37.251 --> 05:39.811
- But not anymore.
- No.

05:43.331 --> 05:44.844
Hey, Kramer?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.729
Kramer.

05:47.491 --> 05:50.164
- What happened to you right here?
- I don't know.

05:51.771 --> 05:54.126
You know, I was watching
Entertainment Tonight...

05:54.291 --> 05:57.010
...and suddenly, you know,
I got dizzy...

05:57.171 --> 06:00.686
...and the next thing I know,
I hit my head on the coffee table.

06:02.691 --> 06:06.047
- Well, that is... That is strange.
- Yeah, it's...

06:08.011 --> 06:11.128
All right. Oh, Jerry, we're still on
for Friday night, right?

06:11.291 --> 06:13.805
Oh, Friday. No, I can't.
I'm sorry. I have a date.

06:14.811 --> 06:18.201
- But last night you said you were free.
- We just met.

06:18.371 --> 06:21.249
You know, maybe it was
a reaction to the sardines.

06:21.731 --> 06:23.562
l... I can't go alone.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.005
Ask George to go with you.

06:25.891 --> 06:28.530
George, come on. I'll pay for you.

06:28.691 --> 06:29.885
You'll pay? I'm there.

06:33.011 --> 06:34.524
- Why do you need anybody?
- Because...

06:34.691 --> 06:37.888
...I hate being at a table alone
with a married couple...

06:38.051 --> 06:41.805
...talking about their married friends
and their married furniture.

06:41.971 --> 06:45.043
They're always trying to make me
feel like their life is so much better.

06:45.211 --> 06:47.805
You know, I have a very exciting life.

06:47.971 --> 06:49.723
It's very exciting.

06:51.891 --> 06:53.847
You went out with a bullfighter?

06:54.291 --> 06:56.885
Yeah, yeah.
Well, an ex-bullfighter now.

06:57.051 --> 06:59.645
- Wow.
- What was his name?

06:59.811 --> 07:03.247
His name? His name was... Was...

07:03.411 --> 07:06.130
...Eduardo...

07:06.291 --> 07:08.600
...Caroccio.

07:09.411 --> 07:11.163
Pass the salt, please.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.050
Where did you meet him?

07:13.211 --> 07:15.008
Actually, I met him in Switzerland...

07:15.171 --> 07:17.207
...and he was fighting...

07:17.371 --> 07:20.408
Is that the word they use, "fighting"?
They don't really fight the bull.

07:20.571 --> 07:21.845
They avoid fighting the bull.

07:25.091 --> 07:26.649
Bread.

07:29.291 --> 07:32.363
Oh, I just love meeting
new people, you know?

07:32.531 --> 07:35.170
That's how you really
do learn about life.

07:40.651 --> 07:42.846
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

07:43.291 --> 07:47.330
I wasn't gonna say anything, but I
saw he wasn't gonna open his mouth.

07:49.731 --> 07:52.291
You know who's a good actor?
Anthony Quinn.

07:52.451 --> 07:54.123
Oh, Anthony Quinn. Fine actor.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.521
But from what I understand,
not a very good driver.

07:56.931 --> 08:01.243
Hits everything on the road,
but always leaves a note.

08:01.571 --> 08:03.163
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

08:03.331 --> 08:04.684
Excellent film. In fact...

08:04.851 --> 08:06.842
...Quinn said he never felt so good...

08:07.011 --> 08:09.400
...as when he left a note
after smacking into a car.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.010
Come here.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.963
Really, I was only kidding around.

08:14.131 --> 08:15.530
He was only joking, Michael.

08:15.691 --> 08:18.251
You think you're special
because you say, "God bless you"?

08:18.411 --> 08:22.290
I don't think I'm special. My mother
always said I'm not special.

08:23.451 --> 08:25.567
He was only joking, Michael.

08:25.731 --> 08:27.767
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, right.

08:27.931 --> 08:30.081
- Take his side!
- I'm not taking his side.

08:30.251 --> 08:34.529
- Well, whose side are you taking?
- Well, I'm not taking your side!

08:43.770 --> 08:46.239
Kirk Douglas. Now, there's
another very bad driver.

08:46.411 --> 08:47.969
But he's such an unbelievable guy...

08:48.131 --> 08:50.167
...when he hits someone,
he doesn't leave a note.

08:50.331 --> 08:52.720
He sits in his car
and waits for the other person...

08:52.891 --> 08:55.963
...so he can exchange license,
registration and apologize.

09:02.051 --> 09:04.565
I said, "God bless you."
Was that so wrong?

09:04.731 --> 09:06.210
The question is...

09:06.371 --> 09:08.601
...did you allow a space...

09:08.771 --> 09:11.444
...for the husband to come in
with his "God bless you"?

09:11.611 --> 09:14.284
Because as the husband,
he has the right of first refusal.

09:17.651 --> 09:18.845
- Yeah.
- It's me.

09:19.011 --> 09:20.683
- Come on up.
- Yes.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.648
Yes. I definitely waited.

09:22.811 --> 09:24.130
But let me say this.

09:24.291 --> 09:26.327
Once he passes on that option...

09:26.491 --> 09:29.085
...that "God bless you"
is up for grabs.

09:29.251 --> 09:32.766
No argument, unless she's
one of these multiple sneezers...

09:32.931 --> 09:35.240
...and he's holding his
"God bless you" in abeyance...

09:35.411 --> 09:37.322
...until she completes the series.

09:39.131 --> 09:41.008
I don't think she is
a multiple sneezer...

09:41.171 --> 09:44.049
...because she sneezed again later
and it was also a single.

09:44.531 --> 09:46.169
What if she's having an off night?

09:49.091 --> 09:51.002
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:51.171 --> 09:52.320
Well.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.527
If it isn't Mr. Gesundheit.

09:54.691 --> 09:57.046
Oh, yeah. Like there's
something wrong...

09:57.211 --> 09:58.803
...with saying, "God bless you."

09:58.971 --> 10:01.166
I was raised to say, "God bless you."

10:01.851 --> 10:03.250
Shut up.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.765
What does it mean anyway,
"God bless you"?

10:06.931 --> 10:09.525
It's a stupid "stuperstition."

10:09.691 --> 10:11.249
A stupid what?

10:12.571 --> 10:13.720
Whatever.

10:13.891 --> 10:17.600
You wanna make a person feel better,
you shouldn't say, "God bless you."

10:17.771 --> 10:20.922
You should say,
"You're so good-looking."

10:24.771 --> 10:28.366
Yeah. Yeah. That's better
than "God bless you."

10:29.411 --> 10:32.528
Anyway, she left a message on my
machine. She wants you to call her.

10:32.691 --> 10:34.966
- Who?
- Robin.

10:35.131 --> 10:36.280
Why?

10:36.451 --> 10:39.329
Well, I assume she called to apologize.
That's why she called me.

10:39.491 --> 10:40.606
Entertainment Tonight is on.

10:40.771 --> 10:42.489
- Where's the phone?
- Bedroom.

10:42.651 --> 10:45.529
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater
for me, would you?

10:53.371 --> 10:56.090
Georgia peach Marla Maples
reportedly threw...

10:56.251 --> 10:59.687
...yet another stiletto heel at...

10:59.851 --> 11:01.170
What's it like out?

11:01.331 --> 11:03.049
It's chilly out.

11:05.091 --> 11:06.683
Should I take a sweater?

11:07.011 --> 11:09.525
Yeah. You could take
a sweater if you want.

11:09.691 --> 11:11.170
A scarf?

11:11.331 --> 11:15.324
No. Hey, shut this off.
Shut it off.

11:18.371 --> 11:21.124
- What's the matter? What's going on?
- What happened?

11:21.291 --> 11:23.361
- What?
- I think I hit my head again.

11:23.531 --> 11:26.170
- What is wrong?
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

11:26.331 --> 11:27.810
Let me ask you something, Kramer.

11:27.971 --> 11:32.806
The last time you hit your head,
was Mary Hart on TV?

11:34.131 --> 11:35.883
- Yeah.
- That is it!

11:36.051 --> 11:37.609
- What?
- That is it!

11:37.771 --> 11:40.080
Mary Hart's voice! Don't you see?

11:40.251 --> 11:42.446
There's something
about Mary Hart's voice...

11:42.611 --> 11:44.283
...that's giving you seizures.

11:44.451 --> 11:47.170
Just like... Just like...
Just like that woman in Albany!

11:47.331 --> 11:48.923
Mary Hart!

11:49.091 --> 11:51.321
- Oh, my God.
- What?

11:51.731 --> 11:53.767
Well, she apologized,
and she wanted to know...

11:53.931 --> 11:56.240
...if we could get together
Wednesday afternoon.

11:56.411 --> 11:59.005
- Get together?
- Maybe she just wants to talk to me.

11:59.171 --> 12:00.729
Married women don't get together.

12:00.891 --> 12:02.449
They have affairs.

12:02.611 --> 12:05.205
Oh, my God, an affair.

12:05.731 --> 12:06.925
It's so adult.

12:09.011 --> 12:13.607
It's like with stockings and martinis
and William Holden and...

12:15.491 --> 12:18.767
On the other hand, it probably
wouldn't cost me any money.

12:20.451 --> 12:22.965
Are you actually considering this?

12:23.131 --> 12:25.804
I can't have an affair with a married
woman. That's despicable!

12:26.091 --> 12:29.003
It's like hitting a car and driving away
without leaving a note.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.849
Yeah.

12:31.531 --> 12:33.169
Hey, you know who owns that car?

12:33.331 --> 12:35.401
- What car?
- The one that was hit the other night.

12:35.571 --> 12:38.039
- Yeah, who?
- That blond across the street.

12:38.211 --> 12:41.248
The one with the long ponytail,
she wears those blue sweatpants.

12:41.731 --> 12:46.486
The blond with the blue sweatpants.

12:47.171 --> 12:48.365
Yeah, I think I've seen her.

12:49.891 --> 12:51.483
Well, I gotta get going.

12:51.651 --> 12:54.449
I'm meeting a guy
with grey sweatpants.

12:57.411 --> 13:00.881
Wait, wait, wait. How do
you know it's not John Tesh?

13:03.011 --> 13:06.208
- The blond with the blue sweatpants!
- Who is she?

13:06.371 --> 13:09.283
I had a crush on her for a year!
I've been afraid to approach her.

13:09.451 --> 13:11.487
She belongs on one of these
Hallmark cards.

13:11.651 --> 13:14.688
Oh, right! Right!
The blue sweatpants!

13:15.651 --> 13:18.324
It's too bad you can't say
anything because of Angela.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.645
Yeah.

13:22.731 --> 13:24.847
Too bad.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.284
Angela.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.883
Lousy thug.

13:35.331 --> 13:37.561
What kind of sick person
does something like that?

13:37.731 --> 13:39.926
The woman belongs in prison!

13:40.171 --> 13:44.084
I mean, I actually owe it to society
to do something about this!

13:44.251 --> 13:46.526
I can't sit by and allow this to go on!

13:46.691 --> 13:49.967
- It's a moral issue, is what it is.
- Can't compromise your principles.

13:50.131 --> 13:51.610
- How can I live?
- Can't live.

13:51.771 --> 13:54.046
I'm not religious, but I know
where to draw the line.

13:54.211 --> 13:56.042
This country needs
more people like you.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.406
Don't sell yourself short,
saying, "God bless you"...

13:58.571 --> 14:01.847
...to every Tom, Dick and Harry,
at great personal risk.

14:02.371 --> 14:06.046
- I believe strongly in that. You know.
- There should be more people like us.

14:06.211 --> 14:09.169
That's why the world's
in the shape that it's in.

14:09.331 --> 14:11.242
You're telling me.

14:17.011 --> 14:19.479
I just want you to know
I'm gonna do everything I can...

14:19.651 --> 14:22.245
...to make sure the party responsible
is made responsible...

14:22.411 --> 14:23.924
...or something very close to that.

14:24.451 --> 14:26.123
Well, God bless you.

14:27.171 --> 14:28.923
Thank you very much.

14:33.371 --> 14:37.000
Oh, my God. I must be crazy.
What have I done?

14:37.171 --> 14:39.731
- Oh, no. What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

14:40.051 --> 14:42.611
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I just committed adultery.

14:43.051 --> 14:45.406
You didn't commit adultery. I did.

14:47.531 --> 14:49.010
Oh, yeah.

14:49.331 --> 14:51.970
If I didn't do it with you, I would have
done it with someone else.

14:53.251 --> 14:56.527
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
There's a lot of losers out there.

14:57.851 --> 15:00.411
Maybe even someone who didn't say,
"God bless you."

15:00.571 --> 15:02.289
Well, that's a given.

15:02.451 --> 15:05.090
In three years with Michael,
not one "God bless you."

15:06.211 --> 15:08.406
Must be hell living in that house.

15:09.811 --> 15:13.042
- Hi, it's Michael.
- Hi, Michael.

15:13.211 --> 15:16.283
- Is Robin there?
- Robin? No, why?

15:17.251 --> 15:19.321
She said she was gonna be with you.

15:19.491 --> 15:22.369
No, I haven't spoken to her all da...

15:24.131 --> 15:25.564
Yeah, right.

15:25.731 --> 15:27.687
As a... As a matter of fact...

15:27.851 --> 15:31.810
She... She was here and she...
She left a note...

15:31.971 --> 15:36.362
...but l... I wasn't here, but l...
I have the note right here.

15:37.131 --> 15:38.689
If she's not with you, where is she?

15:38.851 --> 15:40.569
Well, l... I don't know.

15:40.731 --> 15:44.201
Is she with your bald friend
from the other night?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.283
No. No.

15:46.451 --> 15:48.885
Come on, Michael.

15:49.251 --> 15:53.290
He's finished. I'm gonna
sew his ass to his face!

15:54.211 --> 15:57.248
I'm gonna twist his neck so hard
his lips will be his eyebrows!

15:57.411 --> 16:00.767
I'm gonna break his joints
and reattach them!

16:01.931 --> 16:04.923
You're so good-looking.

16:06.531 --> 16:10.365
Now, you listen to me, suck-face!

16:10.611 --> 16:12.488
You tell anybody anything...

16:12.651 --> 16:15.768
...and I will carve my initials
in your brain tissue.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.320
- Let me rephrase...
- I'll bash your skull in...

16:18.491 --> 16:21.881
...like a bad cabbage,
and I'll have a party on your head!

16:23.731 --> 16:26.199
- Elaine. This is Angela.
- I'll pluck your body hairs out...

16:26.371 --> 16:28.248
...with my teeth!

16:28.531 --> 16:30.283
Well, I think I get the gist of it.

16:30.451 --> 16:32.760
So you don't say anything
to anybody...

16:32.931 --> 16:35.001
...about me hitting that car.

16:35.171 --> 16:36.809
What car?

16:37.131 --> 16:38.769
Good.

16:38.931 --> 16:42.048
- I'm glad we understand each other.
- It's not complicated.

16:46.371 --> 16:48.885
Very nice meeting you.

16:51.171 --> 16:52.923
Come on up.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.570
Well, well, Mr. Seinfeld...

16:57.731 --> 17:00.564
...that must have been
so frightening...

17:00.731 --> 17:03.882
...when you confronted
that guy in Queens.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.406
Now, let me just see
if I've got the scenario right.

17:06.570 --> 17:08.607
- All right, Elaine.
- No, no, no...

17:08.771 --> 17:10.921
...because I'm picturing...
What? What?

17:11.090 --> 17:12.809
French Connection kind of thing.

17:12.971 --> 17:15.804
You know, sort of a Popeye Doyle
chase through the city.

17:15.971 --> 17:18.201
- It was just a couple of blocks.
- Oh, no, no.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.281
Come on. Don't be so modest.

17:21.171 --> 17:23.082
- Hey.
- Oh.

17:23.731 --> 17:25.686
Did you check your machine?

17:25.851 --> 17:27.762
No. Why? What's happened?

17:28.451 --> 17:31.170
Michael called me today,
and he asked me where Robin was.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.523
- Yeah, okay.
- And I said I hadn't seen her.

17:34.691 --> 17:37.683
- What?
- No, George, you don't understand.

17:37.851 --> 17:40.285
She didn't tell me
she was using me as an excuse.

17:40.611 --> 17:43.284
Okay? But then I realized
what was going on...

17:43.451 --> 17:46.249
...and I said that she left a note.

17:46.651 --> 17:48.562
But he didn't really buy that.

17:48.731 --> 17:51.165
And then... And then
he did mention your name.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.210
He mentioned my name?
What did he say?

17:55.371 --> 17:57.601
He said he was gonna...

17:57.771 --> 18:01.207
...sew your ass to your face.

18:02.091 --> 18:03.604
What?

18:03.771 --> 18:07.161
- Why couldn't you think of something?
- I don't know! He caught me off guard!

18:07.331 --> 18:09.401
You lie! How hard is it to lie!

18:09.571 --> 18:11.084
It's not that hard.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.121
Well, who told you
to sleep with her, George?

18:15.291 --> 18:17.168
Not my fault.
I wasn't gonna do anything...

18:17.331 --> 18:20.767
...until you got her juiced up with your
story about the affair with the matador!

18:20.931 --> 18:24.401
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't said, "God bless you"!

18:24.571 --> 18:27.722
- Don't start.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it, people.

18:27.891 --> 18:29.802
- Matador?
- Oh, God.

18:29.971 --> 18:31.643
What matador?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.802
She told them she had
an affair with a matador.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.324
A matador.

18:35.491 --> 18:37.447
Well, well.

18:42.011 --> 18:45.048
Pray tell, what was
the young man's name?

18:49.451 --> 18:51.806
Eduardo Caroccio.

18:52.211 --> 18:54.679
Eduardo...

18:54.851 --> 18:57.319
...Caroccio.

18:57.731 --> 19:01.406
That's good. That's very good.
Kind of just rolls off the tongue.

19:01.571 --> 19:05.530
Where on the Upper West Side
might a single girl meet a matador?

19:05.691 --> 19:07.204
- Perhaps, Zabar's.
- No.

19:07.371 --> 19:09.931
Or Ray's Pizza.

19:11.971 --> 19:15.850
This person told me to tell you
to get an estimate on the damage.

19:16.011 --> 19:19.799
I already got an estimate. It's $875.

19:19.971 --> 19:22.041
$875?

19:22.371 --> 19:23.963
That's right.

19:24.771 --> 19:26.727
Well, I'll tell you what.

19:26.891 --> 19:30.850
I'll give you a check, and then
this person can pay me back.

19:31.811 --> 19:33.881
Who do I make it out to?

19:34.051 --> 19:37.646
Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

19:37.811 --> 19:41.247
So, what are you doing this weekend?

19:41.611 --> 19:43.169
You have got some nerve.

19:43.331 --> 19:45.447
You smash up my car,
you don't admit it...

19:45.611 --> 19:47.090
...and now you want to ask me out?

19:47.251 --> 19:50.049
- I didn't do it!
- Yeah, right.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.049
You are so good-looking.

19:53.211 --> 19:54.690
Thank you.

19:58.851 --> 20:00.569
Jerry, let's go. You ready?

20:00.731 --> 20:03.291
You really want to do this?
I'm on the road for three weeks.

20:03.451 --> 20:06.443
Excuse me, I've got a maniac
stalking me. I'm not staying in the city.

20:07.451 --> 20:10.124
- All right.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.770
How could you?

20:13.931 --> 20:16.570
- What?
- I never thought you were capable.

20:16.731 --> 20:18.926
- What did I do?
- I talked to Becky Gelke outside.

20:19.091 --> 20:20.365
She told me you hit and ran.

20:21.531 --> 20:23.806
I don't even want to
look at you anymore!

20:23.971 --> 20:27.327
All these years of friendship, and
you're... You're nothing but a felon!

20:27.491 --> 20:29.561
You're an embarrassment
to the building.

20:29.731 --> 20:33.724
I didn't do it. I just had to pay her
to cover for somebody else.

20:34.171 --> 20:36.810
- You're not gonna lie to me, are you?
- No. Never.

20:36.971 --> 20:39.485
All right. I'm glad we got that
straightened out...

20:39.651 --> 20:41.562
...because I got a date with her.

20:43.971 --> 20:46.007
You got a date with Becky Gelke?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.759
- I'm going out with her Saturday.
- Can we get out of here?

20:48.931 --> 20:52.128
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
had an excuse to talk to her.

20:52.291 --> 20:56.000
Well, I'm happy to help
in any way that I can.

21:06.091 --> 21:08.161
Liz Taylor...

21:13.291 --> 21:17.204
A man is paralysed, mentally,
by a beautiful woman.

21:17.371 --> 21:19.123
Advertisers really
take advantage of this.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.851
Don't you love ads where
you see the woman in the bikini...

21:22.011 --> 21:24.571
...next to the 32-piece ratchet set,
you know, and she's...?

21:24.731 --> 21:26.483
We'll be looking at the girl...

21:26.651 --> 21:31.122
...looking at the ratchet set going, "All
right, if she's next to the ratchet set...

21:31.651 --> 21:35.166
...and I had that ratchet set...

21:35.331 --> 21:38.562
...I wonder if that
would mean that...

21:41.811 --> 21:44.530
I better just buy that ratchet set."
