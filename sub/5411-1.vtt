WEBVTT

01:12.448 --> 01:14.814
The Brothers Grimm, Your Majesty.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.197
Thank you so much for coming.

01:25.503 --> 01:30.623
I suppose you're wondering why
anyone my age would request an audience

01:30.800 --> 01:33.667
with the authors of children's stories.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.927
Your letter was most intriguing, madam.

01:37.098 --> 01:41.683
| find your collection of folk tales
quite brilliant actually.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.717
Thank you.

01:43.896 --> 01:46.478
But I must say l was terribly disturbed

01:46.649 --> 01:50.813
when | read your version
of The Little Cinder Girl.

01:52.029 --> 01:55.112
There are those
who swear Perrault's telling,

01:55.283 --> 01:58.696
with its fairy godmother
and magic pumpkins,

01:58.869 --> 02:00.530
would be closer to the truth.

02:00.705 --> 02:03.663
Some claim the shoe was made of fur.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.370
Others insist it was glass.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.660
Well, I guess we'll never know.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.874
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.881
Might I inquire about the painting?

02:14.051 --> 02:16.087
She's really quite er...

02:16.262 --> 02:17.502
extraordinary.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.671
Her name was Danielle...

02:19.849 --> 02:22.090
de Barbarac.

02:22.268 --> 02:24.304
And this...

02:25.813 --> 02:28.930
was her glass slipper.

02:37.575 --> 02:41.067
Perhaps you will allow me
to set the record straight?

02:41.245 --> 02:44.157
Then it's true,... the story?

02:44.332 --> 02:47.540
Yes. Quite.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.746
Now, then.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.245
What is that phrase you use?

02:52.423 --> 02:54.334
Oh, yes.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.544
Once upon a time...

02:58.637 --> 03:00.764
there lived a young girl

03:00.931 --> 03:04.515
who loved her father very much.

04:17.550 --> 04:20.792
Oh, Paulette, it feels just like Christmas!

04:20.970 --> 04:23.677
| get a mother and sisters all in one day!

04:23.848 --> 04:28.592
Yes, it's going to be very exciting here,
what with the Baroness and all...

04:28.769 --> 04:30.805
Oh, hold still!

04:30.980 --> 04:34.188
The master deserves
some happiness after all this time,

04:34.358 --> 04:36.440
bringing up the child on his own.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.191
She must be lovely.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.353
I hope she likes me.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.816
She'll love you.

04:41.991 --> 04:45.324
Just be the little angel
I know is in there somewhere.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.362
And don't chew on the bones at dinner
and give yourself away.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.870
Child, your father arrives any moment!

04:56.630 --> 04:58.495
Gustave, I told you!

04:58.674 --> 04:59.834
Not today!

05:00.009 --> 05:02.546
You look like a girl!

05:02.720 --> 05:04.506
That's what I am, halfwit!

05:04.680 --> 05:06.716
Yeah, but today you look it!

05:07.475 --> 05:09.466
Boy or girl, I can still whip you.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.383
Hah!

05:20.029 --> 05:22.065
Look lively, it's the master.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.886
Welcome home, Monsieur le seigneur.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.267
| see you have brought us a baroness.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.770
l have brought you an entire household,
Maurice.

05:56.941 --> 05:59.307
But I seem to be missing a daughter.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.304
Oh,... Auguste.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.970
It's absolutely charming, really.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.308
Papa!

06:39.483 --> 06:41.519
Oh ho ho!

06:43.279 --> 06:45.270
Oh, look at you, just as I left.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.984
l'll wager your friend Gustave
is around here.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.194
No, sir! I slaughtered him.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.529
He's...

06:53.330 --> 06:55.912
Well, so you did.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.454
I had hoped to present a little lady.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.619
I suppose you'll have to do.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.003
Danielle,

07:03.173 --> 07:07.212
may I present
the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent

07:07.386 --> 07:09.798
and her daughters,
Marguerite and Jacqueline.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.588
Hello, Danielle. At last we meet.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.382
Your father speaks of nothing else.

07:15.561 --> 07:19.645
Ladies, say hello to your new stepsister.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.522
Mademoiselle.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.436
Utopia.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.447
It means paradise.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.821
This may be a bit thick for an eight-year-old.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.157
But we could add it to our library.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.288
Will you read some?

07:38.459 --> 07:40.450
It's been a very long day.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.664
And you're a husband now.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.249
Yes, I'm a husband.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.540
But a father first and forever.

07:49.053 --> 07:52.716
We've been two peas in a pod,
you and l, for a long time.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.007
I suppose this will take
some getting used to.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.518
Did you see the way they ate their supper?

08:00.689 --> 08:02.645
It was perfect!

08:02.816 --> 08:04.477
Like a dance!

08:04.652 --> 08:06.893
- Do you like them?
- Very much.

08:07.071 --> 08:09.153
Good, good.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.315
Because I have to go
to Avignon in a fortnight.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.031
- But you just got back!
- I know.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.491
- For how long?
- Only... three weeks.

08:18.666 --> 08:19.746
- One.
- Two.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.408
- One!
- T... two.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.086
All right, one.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.626
Come on, go to sleep.

08:32.805 --> 08:34.511
Kiss.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.718
Sleep tight.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.441
I've never seen so many gloomy faces
around here.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.602
I shall be back in a week.

08:49.780 --> 08:54.399
Then go. The sooner you leave,
the sooner we can celebrate your return.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.453
Perhaps by then, the three of you
will know each other better.

08:59.623 --> 09:03.616
Huh? l'm counting on you
to teach them the ropes around here.

09:03.794 --> 09:08.254
The Baroness isn't used
to getting her hands dirty.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.977
Thank you, Maurice.

09:24.148 --> 09:26.264
Safe journey, master.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.904
Come along, ladies. Back to your lessons.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.944
Wait! It's tradition.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.159
He always waves at the gate.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.852
Papa!

10:14.782 --> 10:17.114
Papa!

10:19.495 --> 10:21.110
Papa!

10:31.632 --> 10:33.588
Auguste!

10:43.143 --> 10:45.680
l-l love you.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.765
I love you.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.401
No.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.735
Papa!

11:01.203 --> 11:03.285
Auguste.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.572
You cannot leave me here.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.043
You cannot leave me here!

11:19.680 --> 11:21.841
Leave me, leave me!

11:23.684 --> 11:25.766
Papa, please come back!

11:26.937 --> 11:31.601
It would be ten years
before another man would enter her life.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.891
A man who was still a boy

11:34.069 --> 11:35.775
in many, many ways.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.858
| signed a marriage treaty
with the King of Spain

11:39.032 --> 11:42.115
and that boy will obey me,
or there will be hell to pay!

11:42.286 --> 11:44.493
But he does not love her, my lord.

11:44.663 --> 11:47.029
- It's not about love!
- Perhaps it should be.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.449
If he is to become King,
he must accept his responsibilities.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.461
A sapling cannot grow
in the shadow of a mighty oak, Francis.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.839
- He needs sunlight.
- He needs a good whipping.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.599
Really, Francis!

12:08.770 --> 12:10.726
Can't this wait till morning?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.184
lfl can't sleep, neither shall he.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.474
Henry, wake up!

12:16.695 --> 12:18.560
Oh, no.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.946
Not again.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.903
Call out the guard!
Bring him back!

14:11.935 --> 14:14.472
Come on, you stupid beast!

14:14.646 --> 14:17.388
Come on! Yah!

14:18.316 --> 14:20.102
Oh, no, you don't.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.996
Thief! This will teach you
to steal my father's horse!

14:35.167 --> 14:37.203
Mine slipped his shoe. l have no choice.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.540
- And our choice is what? To let you?
- l was borrowing it.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.955
Get out, or I'll wake the house.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.804
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I did not see you.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.312
Your aim would suggest othenNise.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.644
And for that I know I must die.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.061
Then er...

15:06.239 --> 15:08.571
speak of this to no-one and er...

15:08.742 --> 15:10.824
I shall be lenient.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.036
We have other horses, Highness.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.243
Younger, if that is your wish.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.919
| wish for nothing more
than to be free of my gilded cage.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.043
For your silence.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.678
| asked for four-minute eggs,
not four one-minute eggs.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.312
And where in God's name is our bread?!

15:41.483 --> 15:44.099
It's just coming out of the oven, my lady.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.268
Marguerite, precious,

15:46.446 --> 15:48.562
what do | always say about tone?

15:48.740 --> 15:52.358
A lady of breeding
ought never to raise her voice

15:52.536 --> 15:55.903
above the gentle hum of a whispering wind.

15:57.874 --> 16:02.493
Jacqueline, dear. Do not speak
unless you can improve the silence.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.707
l was not shrill, l was resonant.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.917
A courtier knows the difference.

16:07.092 --> 16:11.131
I doubt your style of resonance
would be permitted in the Royal Court.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.046
I'm not going to the Royal Court,
am |, Mother?

16:14.224 --> 16:19.093
No-one is. Except some Spanish pig
they have the nerve to call a princess.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.013
Darling, nothing is final until you're dead.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.681
And even then I'm sure God negotiates.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.322
Why is there no salt on this table?

16:33.076 --> 16:35.362
Danielle!

16:36.204 --> 16:38.240
Coming!

16:38.415 --> 16:40.406
She's in one of her moods!

16:40.584 --> 16:42.575
Did the sun rise in the east?

16:42.752 --> 16:44.492
Yes, Louise, it did.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.007
And it is going to be a beautiful day!

16:48.175 --> 16:50.166
Look at all those feathers!

16:50.343 --> 16:52.334
Child, where did you get this?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.798
From an angel of mercy.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.429
I know what to do with them.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.012
Maurice?

16:59.186 --> 17:02.804
If the Baroness can sell
your husband to pay her taxes,

17:02.981 --> 17:04.937
then these can bring him home.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.099
The Court will have to let him go.

17:07.277 --> 17:11.395
But the King has sold him to Cartier.
He's bound for the Americas.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.690
This is our home,
and I will not see it fall apart.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.654
We are waiting!

17:16.828 --> 17:18.819
Take heed, mistress,

17:18.997 --> 17:21.579
or these coins are as good as hers.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.794
Morning, madame,

17:28.965 --> 17:31.251
Marguerite, Jacqueline.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.462
I trust you slept well.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.303
What kept you?

17:37.474 --> 17:40.637
I fell off the ladder in the orchard,
but I am better now.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.392
Someone's been reading
in the fireplace again.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.554
Look at you. Ash and soot everywhere.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.316
Some people read
because they cannot think for themselves.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.228
Why don't you sleep with the pigs,
Cinder-Soot,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.657
if you insist on smelling like one?

17:54.824 --> 17:57.156
That was harsh, Marguerite.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.243
Danielle, come here, child.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.912
Your appearance does reflect
a certain... crudeness, my dear.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.168
What can I do to make you try?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.163
I do try, Stepmother.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.666
I do wish to please you.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.925
Sometimes, I sit on my own

18:16.096 --> 18:19.054
and try to think of what else I could do,
how to act...

18:19.224 --> 18:22.091
Oh, calm down, child. Relax.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.851
Perhaps if we brought back Maurice,
I would not offend you so.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.690
It is your manner that offends, Danielle.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.777
Throughout these hard times,
l have sheltered you and cared for you.

18:38.952 --> 18:43.116
All that | ask in return
is that you help me here without complaint.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.702
Is that such an extraordinary request?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.866
- No, my lady.
- Very well.

18:48.044 --> 18:52.208
We shall have no more talk
of servants coming back. Understood?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.418
Yes, my lady.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.795
After all that I do!

18:59.973 --> 19:01.884
After all l have done!

19:02.058 --> 19:03.309
It's never enough.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.685
Eggs are cold.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.191
Oh, no, there's nothing there!

19:17.365 --> 19:19.321
There's nothing!

19:19.492 --> 19:21.904
I beg you, please leave us alone.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.113
Please!

19:24.748 --> 19:27.330
- No, no, not that.
- Out of the way, old man!

19:31.087 --> 19:34.579
- Get on the horses!
- It's the Royal Guard! Run!

19:39.262 --> 19:41.344
God, I don't believe this!

19:42.599 --> 19:44.135
The painting...

19:47.187 --> 19:49.553
Please, for the love of God, the painting.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.770
- That man, he's getting away.
- The Guard will assist you. I cannot.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.069
Please, sir!

19:55.236 --> 19:57.898
It is... my life.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.547
Ugly bastard! Fast!

20:20.220 --> 20:22.131
Yah!

20:34.442 --> 20:37.809
Give it to me! Give it to me!

20:51.668 --> 20:53.659
Got you! Give me that!

21:27.579 --> 21:29.661
No. Too small.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.489
It needs to draw some attention.

21:32.667 --> 21:37.036
I fear, Baroness,
anything larger might make her fall over.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.455
Perhaps you are right.
I shall have to look elsewhere.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.669
l have just the thing!

21:43.470 --> 21:45.927
Have you lost your marbles?

21:46.097 --> 21:48.554
Do you know what the punishment is

21:48.725 --> 21:51.717
for servants who dress above their station?

21:51.895 --> 21:53.931
Five days in the stocks.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.687
You'd do the same for me, admit it.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.732
Me? Pretend to be a courtier?

21:59.903 --> 22:03.942
Prancing round like some nobleman
when I've never been to court.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.571
And neither have you!

22:05.742 --> 22:07.528
Then I won't be recognized.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
Hand me that gown so I can be on my way.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.080
They'll never buy it.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.241
You are too sweet.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.536
They'll never buy a servant
with 20 gold francs either.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.750
I am Maurice's only hope.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.674
And the Baroness, what did you tell her?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.881
I am picking wildflowers.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.092
Gustave, can you still see her?

22:30.266 --> 22:33.804
- They're buying a brooch.
- Unbelievable.

22:33.978 --> 22:37.220
She ignores the manor,
blames us for her debt,

22:37.398 --> 22:40.356
and still pretends to have money to burn.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.736
Don't you dare laugh.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.359
I'm coming out.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.449
The shoes are too big.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.420
Nobody will be looking at your feet.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.252
Yards of fabric and I still feel naked.

23:09.681 --> 23:12.218
If you're going to be a noblewoman,

23:12.392 --> 23:14.474
you must play the part.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.348
You look down to no-one.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.394
I am just a servant in a nice dress.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.110
Come.
We have to do something with that hair.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.160
Oh!

23:34.330 --> 23:35.490
Thank you.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.031
- Henry, you promised.
- I know.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.291
I lied.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.495
lthought”

23:43.673 --> 23:46.881
I'd see the world before
I gave up my life to God and country.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.087
Why on earth did you stop?

23:49.262 --> 23:51.002
I suppose I lack conviction.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.841
You seem to have it in spades.

23:53.016 --> 23:56.349
Besides, you claimed
it was a matter of life and death.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.306
A woman always is, Sire.

24:01.691 --> 24:05.183
She laughs at me, sir,
as if she knows something I do not.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.397
The lady had many secrets.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.563
l merely painted one of them.

24:09.741 --> 24:14.701
Signor da Vinci has been invited
to the palace as the artist in residence.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.327
Leonardo da Vinci?

24:16.497 --> 24:19.705
Michelangelo was trapped
under a ceiling in Rome.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.457
I'm just a second choice.

24:21.628 --> 24:25.041
I am on my way to Genoa
and | find my salvation on the highway!

24:25.214 --> 24:27.921
Sir, you are the founder
of fonNard thinking,...

24:28.092 --> 24:30.378
and my father is the king of backward.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.794
Could you talk him into the 16th century?

24:32.972 --> 24:35.304
Captain Laurent, do translate.

24:35.475 --> 24:39.593
Prince Henry suffers from
an arranged marriage, signore,...

24:39.771 --> 24:41.261
among other things.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.741
Oh! Your Highness.

24:56.371 --> 24:59.078
What a lovely surprise.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.491
To what do we owe this great honor?

25:02.669 --> 25:05.251
l'm returning your horse, Baroness.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.038
- Oh. Was it missing?
- Yes.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.582
I took the liberty of borrowing it earlier.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.751
I'm afraid I scared your servant...

25:12.929 --> 25:16.968
A young lady with a...
quite a good arm, actually.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.257
- She is mute, my lord.
- Really?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.847
She spoke quite forcefully.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.103
Well, it comes and goes.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.857
But as always Your Highness
is welcome to anything he wishes.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.109
Anything at all.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.604
Wait for me!

25:33.700 --> 25:35.110
Oh, ladies.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.865
Here you are.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.403
Your Highness.

25:42.834 --> 25:46.747
Your Highness, may I present
Marguerite Francoise Louise,

25:46.921 --> 25:48.582
of the House of Ghent?

25:48.756 --> 25:50.997
And Jacqueline.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.291
You may indeed.

25:53.469 --> 25:57.803
Ladies, forgive me, but you seem
to have blossomed overnight.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.799
We're so looking fonNard

26:00.977 --> 26:04.970
to celebrating the engagement
to your own Spanish rose.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.514
Yes, well, there have been...

26:07.692 --> 26:11.435
several new developments
with regards to Spain.

26:11.612 --> 26:15.150
I must say, Marguerite, that brooch is...

26:15.324 --> 26:16.609
stunning.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.820
This old thing?

26:19.287 --> 26:21.323
You're too kind.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.371
These developments...

26:27.545 --> 26:29.581
I trust are for the best?

26:30.757 --> 26:32.213
Let us hope so.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.248
Good day, ladies.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.166
Make way for the lady.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.407
Come on, move it!

27:52.255 --> 27:54.371
Lord, give me strength.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.249
Come on, come on!

28:04.892 --> 28:07.804
| wish to address the issue
of this gentleman.

28:07.979 --> 28:11.688
He is my servant and I am here
to pay the debt against him.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.894
You're too late, he's paid for.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.480
I can pay you 20 gold francs.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.191
You can have me for 20 gold francs.
Drive on!

28:20.116 --> 28:21.947
I demand you release him at once

28:22.118 --> 28:24.484
or I shall take this matter to the King.

28:24.662 --> 28:28.371
The King is the one that sold him.
He's now the property of Cartier.

28:28.541 --> 28:31.704
He is not property at all,
you ill-mannered tub of guts.

28:31.878 --> 28:34.995
Do you think it right
to chain people like chattel?

28:35.172 --> 28:37.458
I demand you release him at once!

28:37.633 --> 28:39.294
Get out of my way!

28:39.468 --> 28:43.677
- You dare raise your voice to a lady, sir?
- Your Highness...

28:44.599 --> 28:46.635
F-Forgive me, Sire.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.304
I meant no disrespect.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.144
It's just er...

28:52.315 --> 28:56.354
l'm following orders. It's my job
to take these thieves to the coast.

28:56.527 --> 28:59.189
A servant is not a thief, Your Highness,

28:59.363 --> 29:02.025
and those who are cannot help themselves.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.190
Really?

29:04.368 --> 29:05.949
Well, then. By all means,

29:06.120 --> 29:07.826
enlighten us.

29:07.997 --> 29:15.415
If you suffer your people to be ill-educated
and their manners corrupted from infancy,

29:15.588 --> 29:20.582
then punish them for those crimes to
which their first education disposed them,

29:20.760 --> 29:23.126
what else is to be concluded, Sire,

29:23.304 --> 29:26.467
but that you first make thieves
and then punish them?

29:32.647 --> 29:34.638
Well, there you have it.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.396
Release him.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.853
- But, Sire...
- I said...

29:39.028 --> 29:40.939
release him!

29:41.113 --> 29:43.195
Yes, Sire.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.739
I thought I was looking at your mother.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.533
Meet me at the bridge.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.578
Prepare the horses! We will leave at once!

30:05.888 --> 30:07.970
I thank you, Your Highness.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.066
Have we met?

30:20.820 --> 30:23.277
I do not believe so, Your Highness.

30:23.823 --> 30:27.691
I could have sworn
I knew every courtier in the province.

30:27.868 --> 30:30.610
Well,... I'm visiting a cousin.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.779
- Who?
- My cousin.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.993
Yes, you said that. Which one?

30:36.252 --> 30:38.243
The only one l have, Sire.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.161
Are you coy on purpose,

30:40.339 --> 30:43.297
or do you honestly refuse
to tell me your name?

30:43.467 --> 30:46.300
No! And yes.

30:46.470 --> 30:51.840
Then, pray, tell me your cousin's name so
I might call upon her to learn who you are.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.977
Anyone who can quote Thomas More
is well worth the effort.

30:58.149 --> 31:00.265
The Prince has read Utopia?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.737
I found it sentimental and dull.

31:03.904 --> 31:07.613
I confess, the plight
of the everyday rustic bores me.

31:07.783 --> 31:11.025
I gather you do not converse
with many peasants.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.865
Certainly not, no! Naturally.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.783
Excuse me, Sire,
but there is nothing natural about it.

31:17.960 --> 31:23.045
A country's character is defined
by its everyday rustics, as you call them.

31:23.215 --> 31:27.504
They are the legs you stand on.
That position demands respect, not...

31:27.678 --> 31:31.591
Am I to understand
that you find me arrogant?

31:32.975 --> 31:35.717
Well, you gave one man back his life,

31:35.895 --> 31:38.637
but did you even glance at the others?

31:40.816 --> 31:42.647
Please, I beg of you,

31:42.818 --> 31:44.854
a name. Any name.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.865
I fear that the only name to leave you with

31:52.036 --> 31:55.153
is Comtesse Nicole de Lancret.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.249
There now.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.455
That wasn't so hard.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.166
Oh, Henry!

32:05.841 --> 32:07.092
Hello, Mother.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.171
The King would like a word with you.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.177
Several, in fact.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.758
He usually does.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.639
I shall be right in.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.430
You, sir, are restricted to the grounds.

33:41.604 --> 33:42.969
Am I under house arrest?

33:43.147 --> 33:45.889
Do not mock me, boy,
for I am in a foul disposition.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.273
- And I will have my way.
- Or what?

33:48.444 --> 33:51.277
You'll send me to the Americas
like some criminal?

33:51.447 --> 33:53.779
All for the sake of your stupid contract.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.905
You are the Crown Prince of France.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.488
And it is my life.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.653
Francis, sit down before you have a stroke.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.787
Really, the two of you.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.289
Sweetheart,

34:04.460 --> 34:09.454
you were born to privilege,
and with that comes specific obligations.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.294
Forgive me, Mother,
but marriage to a stranger

34:12.468 --> 34:14.959
never made anyone in this room very happy.

34:15.721 --> 34:20.385
Marry Gabriela by the next full moon
or I will strike at you in any way I can.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.175
What's it to be, Father? Hot oil or the rack?

34:24.146 --> 34:26.478
I will simply deny you the crown

34:26.649 --> 34:28.640
and... live forever!

34:28.817 --> 34:29.977
Good.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.483
Agreed.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.519
I don't want it.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.575
He's your son!

34:44.500 --> 34:46.491
Somebody's in trouble!

34:46.669 --> 34:49.001
What do you mean?

34:49.171 --> 34:51.082
You stupid, stupid girl!

34:51.257 --> 34:53.168
How dare you do this to me?

34:53.342 --> 34:55.628
To Marguerite?
It all makes me sick!

34:55.803 --> 34:59.170
It's deceitfulness
and I will not have it in this house!

34:59.348 --> 35:00.929
What did I do?

35:01.100 --> 35:02.965
Think, Danielle.

35:03.143 --> 35:05.634
Think really hard.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.649
Prince Henry stole our horse this morning?

35:16.824 --> 35:17.859
Yes!

35:18.033 --> 35:21.776
And that would explain
why he returned it this afternoon.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.787
How dare you let him surprise us like that?

35:24.957 --> 35:26.948
I'm sorry.

35:27.126 --> 35:31.119
Luckily for you, Marguerite turned in
a beautiful performance.

35:32.715 --> 35:35.548
She and the Prince had quite an interlude.

35:35.718 --> 35:38.130
I shouldn't be surprised
if he drops by again.

35:38.304 --> 35:41.546
Come, come!
I must know exactly what was said.

35:41.724 --> 35:44.466
The simplest phrase can have
a thousand meanings.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.259
He said you were forceful.
What did you say?

35:51.567 --> 35:54.309
l-l called him a thief, madam.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.319
I did not recognize him.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.697
Oh, Danielle.

36:04.872 --> 36:08.080
You poor, little country girl.

36:10.669 --> 36:16.084
Well, we must work extra hard
to make sure the manor is spotless.

36:16.258 --> 36:20.297
We cannot have a royal bottom
sitting on a dirty chaise, can we?

36:20.471 --> 36:22.382
No.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.220
What is he doing here?

36:24.391 --> 36:26.552
l-l have worked off your...

36:28.103 --> 36:30.094
My debt, madame.

36:30.272 --> 36:32.513
They told me I could go home.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.522
Fine.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.729
Go... catch a chicken!

36:42.493 --> 36:44.529
Who, dear?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.739
Comtesse Nicole de Lancret.

36:47.498 --> 36:49.534
She's a cousin of...

36:49.708 --> 36:52.415
Actually, I don't know who her cousin is.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.326
Surely you have heard of her?

36:54.505 --> 36:55.961
Oh, darling,

36:56.131 --> 37:00.625
there are simply too many courtiers
to remember them all by name.

37:00.803 --> 37:02.634
Why do you ask?

37:02.805 --> 37:03.885
Mm?

37:04.056 --> 37:06.138
Oh, never mind.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.974
In honor of Signor da Vinci,

37:09.144 --> 37:11.226
l have decided to throw a ball.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.353
A masked ball.

37:13.524 --> 37:16.266
At which point,
you and I will strike a compromise.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.149
Compromise? You?

37:18.320 --> 37:19.856
If love is what you seek,

37:20.030 --> 37:22.271
| suggest you find it before then.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.906
Five days hence, at the stroke of midnight,

37:25.077 --> 37:28.661
you will announce your engagement
to the girl of your choice,

37:28.831 --> 37:31.493
or... I will announce it for you.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.498
Are we agreed?

37:34.670 --> 37:36.501
What of your treaty?

37:36.672 --> 37:40.005
Let me worry about Spain.
You've got bigger problems.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.552
Choose wisely, Henry.

37:43.220 --> 37:46.428
Divorce is only
something they do in England.

38:00.070 --> 38:01.105
Canceled.

38:01.280 --> 38:06.525
Rumor has it he must find himself
a bride before that very night.

38:06.702 --> 38:09.114
Well, that doesn't give us very much time.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.700
I shall need to know

38:11.874 --> 38:14.866
who the competition is,
every move he makes,

38:15.043 --> 38:17.420
his agenda,

38:18.839 --> 38:21.751
and any other tidbits you might pick up.

38:24.970 --> 38:29.054
He's playing tennis with
the Marquis de Limoges tomorrow at noon.

38:30.559 --> 38:33.892
A skin of such... elegance

38:34.062 --> 38:39.022
concealing such... ruthlessness.

38:42.196 --> 38:45.484
I've grown rather fond
of our intrigues together.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.397
Surely you must know that.

38:48.076 --> 38:51.034
I'm having an inkling, my lady.

38:52.039 --> 38:54.075
When my daughter is Queen,

38:54.249 --> 38:57.332
perhaps we might come
to a new arrangement.

39:04.092 --> 39:08.552
I'd have given anything
to see you all dressed up like a courtier.

39:08.722 --> 39:11.008
Speaking to the Prince like a lady.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.174
Scolding him is more like it.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.310
I cannot believe
I gave him my mother's name.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.100
The man is insufferable.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.107
Yes. You've been saying that

39:22.277 --> 39:24.142
all day.

39:24.321 --> 39:27.108
Well, it's as true now
as it was this morning.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.533
Oh!

39:28.700 --> 39:31.112
Darling, he's royalty.

39:31.828 --> 39:33.910
They're born like that.

39:34.581 --> 39:39.792
Then I suppose the penalty for being
wealthy is having to live with the rich.

39:39.962 --> 39:42.123
I'll bet he's quite charming

39:42.297 --> 39:44.162
once you get to know him.

39:44.341 --> 39:47.208
I think he and Marguerite
deserve each other.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.377
Oh! Bite your tongue!

39:49.555 --> 39:54.515
The only throne I want her sitting on
is the one I have to clean every day.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.980
What's wrong with this one?

39:59.147 --> 40:01.138
- It's blue.
- Henry loves blue!

40:01.316 --> 40:04.353
And 50 other girls
will be wearing the same color.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.940
Very good, Marguerite.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.855
This one is too small.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.490
We shall just have to get you
a tighter cinch.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.652
I cannot breathe as it is.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.367
If one cannot breathe, one cannot eat.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.657
Mother, focus, please!

40:19.835 --> 40:22.668
Perhaps ifl knew
what you were looking for!

40:22.838 --> 40:24.624
Something fit for a queen!

40:30.178 --> 40:33.511
Come, ladies. I havejust the thing.

40:33.682 --> 40:35.843
But we must speak of this to no-one.

40:36.018 --> 40:38.009
Oh, I do love a good intrigue!

40:43.358 --> 40:45.223
Waste not,

40:45.402 --> 40:47.438
want not.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.952
Oh, perfect!

40:59.041 --> 41:01.123
Oh, look at these shoes.

41:02.002 --> 41:04.038
Where did you get these?

41:04.212 --> 41:07.045
They're Danielle's dowry, for her wedding.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.830
Cinderella? Married?

41:09.009 --> 41:10.874
To who, the chimney sweep?

41:11.053 --> 41:14.261
If that dress is hers,
perhaps she'll want to wear it to the ball.

41:14.431 --> 41:17.923
Since when does a royal function
include commoners?

41:18.101 --> 41:20.057
Well, never.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.889
But she is our stepsister

41:22.064 --> 41:25.522
and the invitation did say,
"To the ladies of the house".

41:25.692 --> 41:28.308
- She's not of noble blood.
- And who would notice?

41:28.487 --> 41:31.069
Honestly, Jacqueline,
whose side are you on?

41:33.367 --> 41:35.403
What are you doing?

41:38.080 --> 41:41.413
Airing out your dress... for the masque.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.290
Her dress? But you just said...

41:44.461 --> 41:49.171
I suppose for a commoner, it'll have to do.
I mean, look at it.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.753
It's practically an antique.

41:54.971 --> 41:58.463
You wish me... to go to a masque?

41:58.642 --> 42:01.008
- Mm.
- Of course.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.764
I don't know what to say.

42:03.939 --> 42:05.850
Say? Honestly, Danielle.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.858
It hurts me you don't feel like
one of my daughters.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.064
I only meant...

42:12.239 --> 42:13.979
I thought we could all go
as one big happy family.

42:14.157 --> 42:18.742
That is, if you complete your chores in time,
mind your manners till then.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.284
What's the matter with her?

42:27.462 --> 42:31.296
Oh... She doesn't want you to go.

42:35.554 --> 42:39.638
Do you really think
there is only one perfect mate?

42:39.808 --> 42:41.764
As a matter of fact, I do.

42:41.935 --> 42:43.926
How can you be certain to find them?

42:44.104 --> 42:47.141
And if you find them,
are they really the one for you,

42:47.315 --> 42:49.101
or do you only think they are?

42:49.276 --> 42:52.313
What if the person you're meant to be with
never appears?

42:52.487 --> 42:55.604
Or she does, but...
but you're too distracted to notice?

42:55.782 --> 42:57.647
You learn to pay attention.

42:57.826 --> 42:59.862
Then, let's say...

43:00.287 --> 43:02.494
God puts two people on earth

43:02.664 --> 43:05.326
and they are lucky enough
to find one another.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.242
But... one of them gets hit by lightning.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.411
Well, then what?

43:10.589 --> 43:12.375
Is that it?

43:12.549 --> 43:15.461
Or perchance you meet someone new
and marry again.

43:15.635 --> 43:18.843
Is that the lady you should be with?
Or was it the first?

43:19.014 --> 43:23.223
When the two of them are side by side,
were they both the one for you

43:23.393 --> 43:25.554
and you just met the first one first?

43:25.729 --> 43:28.220
Or is the second one supposed to be first?

43:28.398 --> 43:30.730
And is everything just chance

43:31.610 --> 43:33.646
or are some things meant to be?

43:33.820 --> 43:36.778
You cannot leave everything to fate, boy.

43:36.948 --> 43:40.736
She's got a lot to do.
Sometimes you must give her a hand.

43:40.911 --> 43:42.947
What's this project?

43:43.121 --> 43:45.157
Would you care to see if they work?

44:41.346 --> 44:43.428
It looks like rain.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.934
Signor da Vinci!

44:50.105 --> 44:51.720
Are you all right?

44:51.898 --> 44:55.106
I should leave walking on water
to the Son of God.

44:55.277 --> 44:57.939
Fortunately, I tripped over an angel.

44:58.655 --> 45:00.520
Comtesse!

45:00.699 --> 45:03.236
Your Highness! Oh!

45:04.870 --> 45:08.033
Oh, careful, it's very slippery right there.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.655
Here, please. Allow me.

45:10.834 --> 45:11.869
Oh!

45:12.043 --> 45:14.295
Thank you.

45:23.847 --> 45:25.883
Where are your attendants?

45:26.057 --> 45:28.969
I decided to give them the day off.

45:29.144 --> 45:31.135
Day off?

45:31.313 --> 45:33.178
From what? Life?

45:33.356 --> 45:36.393
Don't you tire of people waiting on you
all the time?

45:36.568 --> 45:39.981
Yes, but... they're servants.
It's what they do.

45:40.155 --> 45:44.148
I wish I could dismiss mine
as easily as you do yours.

45:44.326 --> 45:46.317
I must be going.

45:46.494 --> 45:48.655
- You're angry with me.
- No.

45:48.872 --> 45:50.578
Admit it.

45:50.749 --> 45:53.331
- Well, yes, if you must know.
- Why?

45:53.501 --> 45:56.743
Because you are trying to bait me
with your snobbery.

45:57.714 --> 46:01.332
I'm afraid, mademoiselle,
you are a walking contradiction

46:01.509 --> 46:03.636
and I find that rather fascinating.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.714
- Me?
- Yes, you.

46:05.889 --> 46:09.882
You spout the ideals of a Utopian society,
yet you live the life of a courtier.

46:10.060 --> 46:13.848
You own all the land there is,
yet you take no pride in working it.

46:14.022 --> 46:16.013
Is that not also a contradiction?

46:16.191 --> 46:18.682
First I'm arrogant, and now I have no pride.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.851
However do I manage that?

46:21.029 --> 46:24.692
You have everything
and still the world holds no joy.

46:24.866 --> 46:29.485
Yet you make fun of those
who would see it for its possibilities.

46:30.872 --> 46:32.908
How do you do it?

46:33.083 --> 46:34.368
What?

46:34.542 --> 46:39.036
Live each day with this kind of passion?
Don't you find it exhausting?

46:39.214 --> 46:41.045
Only when I'm around you.

46:41.216 --> 46:43.377
Why do you like to irritate me so?

46:43.551 --> 46:45.712
Why do you rise to the occasion?

46:48.807 --> 46:50.388
Danielle!

46:53.395 --> 46:54.726
Er...

46:54.896 --> 46:58.639
Forgive me, Your Highness,
I've lost track of the hour.

46:58.817 --> 46:59.977
But the wind...

47:00.151 --> 47:02.733
- It's perfect!
- I am sorry.

47:02.904 --> 47:04.986
I'm playing tennis tomorrow.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.272
- Will you come?
- I must go.

47:09.119 --> 47:11.360
Why does she keep doing that?

47:13.581 --> 47:15.572
Paulette.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.615
Where are the candlesticks?

47:17.794 --> 47:19.409
We can hardly see our plates.

47:19.587 --> 47:23.250
They're missing, my lady.
I've searched high and low.

47:23.425 --> 47:25.416
The painting in the hall is gone too.

47:25.593 --> 47:27.675
It seems we have a thief in our midst.

47:27.846 --> 47:31.304
Hmm. So this is how I'm treated
after all our years together.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.510
My husband's prize possessions!

47:33.685 --> 47:38.850
Well, I shall just garnish your wages
until the pilfered items are returned.

47:39.024 --> 47:41.982
- Is that quite understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

47:43.403 --> 47:47.612
Perhaps I shall ship you to the Americas
with all the other thieves.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.283
Oh. Didn't you hear?

47:49.451 --> 47:52.409
The Prince asked the King
to release all those men.

47:52.579 --> 47:54.490
-HedMnﬂ
-Mmm.

47:54.664 --> 47:56.120
Now, by...

47:58.334 --> 48:03.249
By royal decree,
any man who sails must be compensated.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.041
Compensated!

48:05.216 --> 48:08.333
Honestly! What is the world coming to?

48:08.511 --> 48:12.095
I want to know who this Comtesse is
everyone keeps talking about.

48:12.265 --> 48:16.554
Ten courtiers were speaking of her today
and how the Prince tell all over himself.

48:16.728 --> 48:20.641
We should find out
who she is and bury her.

49:13.868 --> 49:16.245
You're looking well, Marguerite.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.075
You're welcome to look, Your Highness.

49:44.566 --> 49:46.682
Danielle de Barbarac.

49:47.902 --> 49:49.984
You get prettier every week.

49:50.155 --> 49:53.113
And you, Monsieur le Pieu,
are wasting your flattery.

49:53.283 --> 49:56.741
It's a pity your soil's
the best in the province,

49:56.911 --> 49:59.072
and yet so poorly tended.

49:59.247 --> 50:01.738
We have limited resources, sir.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.658
- We do the best we can.
- Anything I can do?

50:04.836 --> 50:08.670
You should bring it up with the Baroness
and stick to shopping.

50:08.840 --> 50:12.674
I'd rather discuss it with Danielle,
if you don't mind.

50:13.219 --> 50:18.179
I may be twice your age, child,
but I'm well-endowed.

50:19.601 --> 50:21.717
As evidenced by my estate.

50:22.478 --> 50:25.936
I've always had a soft spot
for the less fortunate.

50:26.107 --> 50:28.223
You need a wealthy benefactor.

50:29.402 --> 50:31.893
And I need a young lady with spirit.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.732
Prunes?

50:34.616 --> 50:35.776
No.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.237
I'll buy nothing this week.

50:38.411 --> 50:42.450
And you'd do well to remember
that without my generosity

50:42.624 --> 50:45.991
your pathetic little farm
would cease to exist.

50:46.169 --> 50:50.754
So I'd be very, very careful if I were you.

50:58.348 --> 51:00.384
Ooh! Horrible man!

51:00.558 --> 51:04.221
If he didn't buy
a bushel of vegetables every week,

51:04.395 --> 51:06.431
I'd spit on him.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.656
Here.

51:15.823 --> 51:18.314
Never have you tasted anything so

51:18.493 --> 51:19.858
delicious.

51:29.420 --> 51:30.455
Mmm.

51:31.256 --> 51:33.417
Don't even think about it.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.252
Like it?

51:35.677 --> 51:37.338
Like it?

51:37.512 --> 51:40.720
Why, it's positively sinful.

51:40.890 --> 51:42.630
What's it called?

51:42.809 --> 51:44.345
Er... chocolate.

51:44.519 --> 51:47.602
The Spanish monks keep sending
bricks of it.

51:53.403 --> 51:55.644
These are our servants, Your Highness.

51:55.822 --> 51:58.029
Really? Oh, I'd love to meet them.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.413
Good day, ladies.

52:13.298 --> 52:17.132
What are you doing?
Trying to scare the Prince to death?

52:17.427 --> 52:19.588
We were startled, that's all.

52:23.224 --> 52:25.260
Were there just the two of you?

52:25.435 --> 52:27.642
And the chicken, Your Highness.

52:32.817 --> 52:36.184
We must press for a quick engagement.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.353
Paris at Christmas.

52:38.531 --> 52:40.567
Can you imagine?

52:43.745 --> 52:47.033
No. I don't suppose you can.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.750
My mother was hard on me too, you know.

52:53.671 --> 52:57.414
She taught me
that cleanliness was next to godliness.

52:58.468 --> 53:01.835
She forced me to wash my face
at least 20 times a day,

53:02.013 --> 53:04.504
convinced it was never clean enough.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.718
I was very grateful to her.

53:08.436 --> 53:10.973
She wanted me to be all that I could be.

53:13.316 --> 53:15.398
And here I am...

53:16.319 --> 53:18.401
a baroness.

53:19.947 --> 53:22.780
And Marguerite shall be Queen.

53:36.672 --> 53:39.334
It's a pity you never knew your mother.

53:40.927 --> 53:44.340
There must be a little bit of her
in you somewhere.

53:47.642 --> 53:50.258
I wish I knew what she looked like.

53:50.436 --> 53:54.179
Yes. Well, we must never feel sorry
for ourselves, must we?

53:54.357 --> 53:58.350
No matter how bad things get,
they can always get worse.

53:59.195 --> 54:01.311
Yes, madam.

54:05.493 --> 54:08.109
You have so much of your father in you.

54:09.330 --> 54:13.323
Sometimes I can almost see him
looking out through your eyes.

54:13.501 --> 54:14.490
Really?

54:16.504 --> 54:18.586
Yes, well...

54:19.465 --> 54:22.332
Your features are so... masculine.

54:25.847 --> 54:29.214
Well,... to be raised by a man...

54:31.477 --> 54:34.389
No wonder you're built for hard labor.

54:38.818 --> 54:41.230
Did you love my father?

54:42.947 --> 54:45.029
Well, I barely knew him.

54:49.579 --> 54:51.661
Now go away.

54:52.290 --> 54:54.372
I'm tired.

55:20.776 --> 55:23.939
Look, Gustave! It's floating!

55:24.113 --> 55:25.319
Why are you so happy?

55:25.490 --> 55:28.402
You'll be swimming in manure
if they get married.

55:28.576 --> 55:30.737
I don't know why it bothers you so.

55:30.912 --> 55:32.527
I couldn't care less.

55:32.705 --> 55:36.289
You're lying! The Prince
would be your brother-in-Iaw

55:36.459 --> 55:41.044
and you, Comtesse de Lancret,
would be bringing them breakfast in bed.

55:41.214 --> 55:43.705
But they would move into the palace

55:43.883 --> 55:47.546
and I could stay with the manor
and turn things around.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.086
You like him. Admit it.

55:50.264 --> 55:52.095
Nope.

55:52.266 --> 55:55.099
And I-I suppose if you saw him again,

55:55.269 --> 55:57.305
y-y-you'd simply...

55:57.480 --> 55:59.436
I'd walk right up to him and say,

55:59.607 --> 56:02.189
"Your Highness, my family is your family."

56:02.360 --> 56:04.351
"Please, take them away."

56:04.529 --> 56:08.568
Good. Because here's your big chance.
He's headed this way.

56:21.546 --> 56:23.411
I'm looking for Signor da Vinci.

56:23.589 --> 56:26.251
We're to go to the monastery.
Have you seen him?

56:26.425 --> 56:28.040
Da Vinci?

56:28.219 --> 56:29.800
No, Your Highness.

56:29.971 --> 56:32.713
Well, is that not his flying contraption?

56:32.890 --> 56:35.472
- Where did you get it?
- From er...

56:35.643 --> 56:37.975
the Comtesse de Lancret.

56:38.813 --> 56:41.145
She is a friend of his.

56:41.315 --> 56:42.350
You know her?

56:42.525 --> 56:45.562
Please, I must find her.
Where is she staying?

56:45.736 --> 56:47.442
Er...

56:47.613 --> 56:49.820
I believe, Your Highness,

56:49.991 --> 56:52.653
that she is staying with a cousin.

56:52.827 --> 56:53.942
The erm...

56:54.120 --> 56:55.701
Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.

56:58.541 --> 57:00.623
That does present a problem.

57:00.793 --> 57:02.579
But...

57:02.753 --> 57:04.835
I do know that she is there

57:05.006 --> 57:07.338
alone, by herself,

57:07.508 --> 57:09.749
at this very moment.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.508
Excellent.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.013
Nice painting.

57:21.731 --> 57:23.471
Gustave!

57:23.649 --> 57:25.640
You horrible little snipe!

57:25.818 --> 57:27.809
Did you hear? He likes my work!

57:27.987 --> 57:30.194
And he is headed toward my house!

57:30.990 --> 57:33.026
Then I suggest you run.

57:54.639 --> 57:57.051
Paulette! Louise! Quick!

58:11.739 --> 58:13.320
Your Highness.

58:13.491 --> 58:15.482
What an unexpected surprise.

58:15.660 --> 58:17.696
Why, Comtesse.

58:18.245 --> 58:20.281
Do you not attend church?

58:20.456 --> 58:23.994
My faith is better served
away from the rabid crowd.

58:25.503 --> 58:29.496
Yes, I'm afraid my father's edict
has created quite a um...

58:29.674 --> 58:31.130
a phenomenon.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.586
Which is why I am bound for the monastery.

58:35.429 --> 58:38.091
The Franciscans
have an astonishing library.

58:38.265 --> 58:42.304
Since you are so fond of reading,
I thought you mightjoin me?

58:42.478 --> 58:44.514
It is not fair, Sire.

58:44.980 --> 58:47.107
You have found my weakness,

58:47.274 --> 58:49.356
but I have yet to learn yours.

58:49.527 --> 58:51.609
I should think it was quite obvious.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.482
Captain Laurent!

58:58.661 --> 59:01.073
I shall not need my horse or your services.

59:03.416 --> 59:05.452
Today, I am simply...

59:06.293 --> 59:08.033
Henry.

59:28.858 --> 59:31.816
Prince Henry left early this morning,
Baroness.

59:31.986 --> 59:34.193
No-one seems to know where he went.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.900
But... I've brought you something

59:37.074 --> 59:39.656
that will brighten up your day.

59:40.661 --> 59:42.697
It's a...

59:45.291 --> 59:49.250
Oh, you vicious, vicious man!

1:00:10.775 --> 1:00:12.811
It makes me want to cry.

1:00:12.985 --> 1:00:14.350
Pick one.

1:00:14.528 --> 1:00:18.362
I could no sooner choose
a favorite star in the heavens.

1:00:18.532 --> 1:00:20.568
What is it that touches you so?

1:00:21.619 --> 1:00:23.655
I guess it's because

1:00:23.829 --> 1:00:27.196
when I was young, my father
would stay up late and read to me.

1:00:27.374 --> 1:00:29.456
He was addicted to the written word.

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:33.040
I would fall asleep
listening to the sound of his voice.

1:00:33.214 --> 1:00:35.205
What sort of books?

1:00:35.382 --> 1:00:37.509
Science, philosophy.

1:00:38.219 --> 1:00:40.335
I suppose they remind me of him.

1:00:40.513 --> 1:00:42.549
He died when I was eight.

1:00:43.057 --> 1:00:45.514
Utopia was the last book he brought home.

1:00:46.727 --> 1:00:49.218
Which explains why you quote it.

1:00:51.315 --> 1:00:55.649
I would rather hear his voice again
than any sound in the world.

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:16.579
Is something wrong?

1:01:22.763 --> 1:01:24.754
In all my years of study,

1:01:24.932 --> 1:01:27.344
not one tutor ever demonstrated

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:30.851
the passion you have shown me
in the last two days.

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:34.438
You have more conviction in one memory

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:37.270
than I have in my entire being.

1:01:46.662 --> 1:01:48.368
Your Highness,

1:01:48.539 --> 1:01:51.576
- if there is anything I have said...
- Please!

1:01:51.750 --> 1:01:53.490
Don't.

1:01:53.669 --> 1:01:56.206
It's not you.

1:02:01.135 --> 1:02:04.127
Make haste, Marguerite. It's now or never.

1:02:06.682 --> 1:02:08.718
Lovely service.

1:02:08.893 --> 1:02:10.929
Forgive me,

1:02:11.103 --> 1:02:13.264
Your Majesty.

1:02:13.439 --> 1:02:15.646
I think you dropped this on your way out.

1:02:15.816 --> 1:02:17.852
My goodness!

1:02:18.611 --> 1:02:21.068
I do not even remember putting it on.

1:02:21.906 --> 1:02:23.942
Thank you, child.

1:02:24.116 --> 1:02:29.577
It is a rare person indeed who would return
such a valuable keepsake.

1:02:29.747 --> 1:02:32.739
You are too magnanimous, Your Majesty.

1:02:34.418 --> 1:02:36.500
How very kind.

1:02:36.670 --> 1:02:39.002
- Her name?
- Marguerite de Ghent.

1:02:39.173 --> 1:02:40.834
Er... er... Marguerite.

1:02:41.008 --> 1:02:45.126
We shall have a chat tomorrow, you and I.

1:02:45.304 --> 1:02:47.169
Bring your mother.

1:02:48.057 --> 1:02:50.844
As you wish.

1:02:53.979 --> 1:02:56.686
Well, this is terribly embarrassing.

1:02:58.317 --> 1:03:01.104
We'll head back to the monastery at once.

1:03:02.738 --> 1:03:04.854
And we shall continue on foot.

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.231
But it's half a day's walk!

1:03:07.409 --> 1:03:11.573
Honestly, Your Highness.
Where is your sense of adventure?

1:03:16.126 --> 1:03:18.959
Well, I guess if you put it that way...

1:03:22.383 --> 1:03:24.795
We can't be too confident, ladies.

1:03:24.969 --> 1:03:28.382
The Prince wasn't in church today
and we need to know why.

1:03:28.555 --> 1:03:30.887
Marguerite gets to do everything.

1:03:31.058 --> 1:03:35.142
Don't be daft, Jacqueline.
The Queen doesn't know you exist.

1:03:35.312 --> 1:03:37.803
What Marguerite does is for all of us.

1:03:37.982 --> 1:03:40.143
We need you to help her get ready.

1:03:40.317 --> 1:03:44.731
Lovely. I shall soon be cleaning
the fireplace with Danielle!

1:03:44.905 --> 1:03:49.274
- Where is that girl?
- Probably catching rabbits with her teeth.

1:03:49.451 --> 1:03:53.990
Begging your pardon, my lady,
but that mirror in your bedchamber,

1:03:54.164 --> 1:03:57.076
- did you move it?
- Of course not. Why?

1:03:57.251 --> 1:03:58.912
It's also missing.

1:03:59.086 --> 1:04:01.623
Then it too shall come out of your pay.

1:04:03.298 --> 1:04:08.088
Either you stop telling her when things
go missing, or we'll be paying her to work.

1:04:08.262 --> 1:04:11.345
Good thing I didn't mention the tapestries.

1:04:17.938 --> 1:04:21.476
You would think I would know
the way to my own castle!

1:04:21.650 --> 1:04:24.062
Why is it men never stop for directions?

1:04:24.236 --> 1:04:26.602
Ah! There it is! It is back that way.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:32.108
And I still can't believe I'm down here
while you're up there!

1:04:32.286 --> 1:04:34.948
And in your undergarments, no less!

1:04:35.122 --> 1:04:38.489
I couldn't very well climb up here
in that gown, could I?

1:04:38.667 --> 1:04:42.626
Besides, if you broke your royal neck,
where would we be?

1:04:42.796 --> 1:04:45.833
You swim alone, climb rocks,
rescue servants.

1:04:46.008 --> 1:04:48.090
Is there anything you don't do?

1:04:49.678 --> 1:04:51.714
Fly.

1:04:51.889 --> 1:04:54.505
Now turn around
so I can climb back down.

1:05:02.566 --> 1:05:04.978
Oh, no. It's you again.

1:05:05.152 --> 1:05:06.858
Stay aloft, madam.

1:05:07.029 --> 1:05:09.111
There are games afoot.

1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:35.088
My wife thanks you for this fine garment,
mademoiselle.

1:05:35.265 --> 1:05:37.677
You will give me back my dress, sir.

1:06:05.045 --> 1:06:06.706
Let her go!

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:09.417
Your quarrel... is with me.

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:11.915
Release her.

1:06:15.556 --> 1:06:18.047
I insist you return my things at once.

1:06:26.525 --> 1:06:30.313
Milady, you may have anything
you can carry.

1:06:33.448 --> 1:06:35.905
May I have your word on that, sir?

1:06:39.454 --> 1:06:42.867
On my honor as a Gypsy,
whatever you can carry.

1:07:14.281 --> 1:07:17.114
Please, come back. I'll give you a horse.

1:07:30.756 --> 1:07:34.795
I want to be informed
the minute she gets home. Understood?

1:07:34.968 --> 1:07:36.959
Yes, ma'am.

1:07:42.643 --> 1:07:45.305
You are reading my thoughts, milord.

1:07:45.479 --> 1:07:47.470
And they're as fuzzy as my own.

1:07:47.648 --> 1:07:49.309
Then France concedes?

1:07:49.483 --> 1:07:51.314
Never!

1:07:51.485 --> 1:07:53.066
My next choice

1:07:53.237 --> 1:07:54.943
will be paper.

1:08:00.577 --> 1:08:02.408
It is your turn.

1:08:02.579 --> 1:08:04.615
And it had better be good.

1:08:08.877 --> 1:08:11.289
I have no desire to be King.

1:08:13.382 --> 1:08:16.749
But think of all the wonderful things
you could do

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:19.009
for your country, for the world.

1:08:19.179 --> 1:08:22.012
Yes, but to be so defined by your position.

1:08:22.182 --> 1:08:24.093
To only be seen as what you are.

1:08:24.268 --> 1:08:26.725
You don't know how insufferable that is!

1:08:26.895 --> 1:08:28.886
You might be surprised.

1:08:29.064 --> 1:08:31.100
Really?

1:08:31.817 --> 1:08:36.026
A Gypsy, for example,
is rarely painted as anything else.

1:08:36.196 --> 1:08:41.361
They're defined by their status
as you are, yet it is not who they are.

1:08:41.535 --> 1:08:46.279
You have been born to privilege,
and with that come specific obligations.

1:08:51.586 --> 1:08:55.295
I am sorry.
My mouth has run away with me again.

1:08:55.465 --> 1:08:57.501
No, my lady.

1:08:58.343 --> 1:08:59.924
It is your mouth

1:09:00.095 --> 1:09:02.302
that has me hypnotized.

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.434
Oh, right here, please.
I don't want to wake anybody up.

1:10:03.075 --> 1:10:05.066
You saved my life, you know,

1:10:05.243 --> 1:10:07.279
back there, in the woods.

1:10:08.288 --> 1:10:10.324
A girl does what she can, Sire.

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:13.457
Henry.

1:10:14.503 --> 1:10:16.585
Henry.

1:10:29.726 --> 1:10:31.387
Nicole.

1:10:33.230 --> 1:10:35.642
Do you know the ruins at Amboise?

1:10:35.816 --> 1:10:36.851
Yes.

1:10:37.025 --> 1:10:38.765
I often go there to

1:10:38.944 --> 1:10:40.980
be alone.

1:10:41.154 --> 1:10:43.315
Would you meet me there tomorrow?

1:10:44.491 --> 1:10:46.607
I shall try.

1:10:46.785 --> 1:10:48.992
Then I shall wait all day.

1:10:58.422 --> 1:11:00.458
Off... with his head.

1:11:00.632 --> 1:11:03.499
Francis, wake up.
Our son has something to tell us.

1:11:03.677 --> 1:11:05.668
Mother, Father.

1:11:05.846 --> 1:11:07.837
I want to build a university

1:11:08.014 --> 1:11:12.132
with the largest library in Europe,
where people of any station can study.

1:11:12.310 --> 1:11:13.345
All right.

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:16.512
Who are you
and what have you done with our son?

1:11:18.191 --> 1:11:20.853
Oh. And I want to invite
the Gypsies to the ball.

1:11:24.364 --> 1:11:26.696
- Are you ill?
- No.

1:11:26.867 --> 1:11:28.403
Uh. Yes.

1:11:28.577 --> 1:11:30.613
Where were you?

1:11:33.832 --> 1:11:35.868
I got lost.

1:11:36.042 --> 1:11:39.500
I don't believe you.
You're hiding something from me.

1:11:39.671 --> 1:11:41.457
I demand to know what it is.

1:11:41.631 --> 1:11:45.123
Why don't you tell me
so I can get back to sleep?

1:11:45.302 --> 1:11:48.385
What about our breakfast?

1:11:48.555 --> 1:11:50.716
You have two hands.

1:11:50.891 --> 1:11:53.052
Make it yourself.

1:11:54.478 --> 1:11:56.685
You lazy little leech!

1:11:58.023 --> 1:12:00.810
Jacqueline! Go and boil some water.

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:03.976
Me? Boil water?

1:12:05.071 --> 1:12:08.313
Oh, I knew it. Ijust knew it.

1:12:12.412 --> 1:12:15.279
Mistress, you'd better get in here quick.

1:12:26.635 --> 1:12:30.594
Oh, look who finally decided
to grace us with her presence.

1:12:30.764 --> 1:12:32.925
What do you think you are doing?

1:12:33.099 --> 1:12:34.225
Trying on my dress.

1:12:34.392 --> 1:12:38.351
Do you think that after this morning
I'd let you go anywhere?

1:12:38.522 --> 1:12:42.185
Do you honestly think
these games and intrigues

1:12:42.359 --> 1:12:45.192
are going to win you a crown?

1:12:45.362 --> 1:12:47.819
To hunt royalty like some sport,
it's disgusting!

1:12:47.989 --> 1:12:49.775
You're just jealous.

1:12:51.284 --> 1:12:53.275
These are my mother's.

1:12:53.453 --> 1:12:54.442
Yes.

1:12:54.621 --> 1:12:56.111
And she's dead.

1:13:01.127 --> 1:13:04.039
- I am going to rip your hair out!
- Mother!

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:06.296
Mother, do something!

1:13:28.655 --> 1:13:30.646
Get away from me or so help me, God...

1:13:30.824 --> 1:13:32.155
No, Marguerite, don't!

1:13:32.325 --> 1:13:34.441
Put it down!

1:13:34.619 --> 1:13:37.326
- Give me the shoes.
- Put it down.

1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:40.826
Consider carefully, Danielle.

1:13:41.001 --> 1:13:43.413
Your father's book or your mother's shoes.

1:13:43.587 --> 1:13:46.169
Though neither will save you from a lashing.

1:13:59.227 --> 1:14:00.933
No! No!

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:04.187
No!

1:14:04.733 --> 1:14:06.769
No, no!

1:14:06.943 --> 1:14:09.025
No.

1:14:28.340 --> 1:14:30.205
Oh!

1:14:33.678 --> 1:14:37.421
Now, you really
brought this upon yourself, you know.

1:14:39.684 --> 1:14:41.720
First with breakfast,

1:14:41.895 --> 1:14:44.682
then that horrid display downstairs.

1:14:47.609 --> 1:14:49.850
I don't know what's come over me.

1:14:52.906 --> 1:14:55.693
Of course, I shall never forget

1:14:55.867 --> 1:14:59.075
the way Marguerite's feet
went up over her head!

1:15:10.006 --> 1:15:13.373
She should not have said that
about your mother.

1:15:18.765 --> 1:15:20.847
Thank you.

1:15:23.770 --> 1:15:26.512
You really must let my doctor look at that.

1:15:27.315 --> 1:15:30.728
To think you saved that baby
from a runaway horse!

1:15:30.902 --> 1:15:34.770
It was a maternal instinct, Your Majesty.

1:15:34.948 --> 1:15:37.564
I'm so sorry my son can't join us.

1:15:37.742 --> 1:15:40.119
He seems to have disappeared again.

1:15:40.286 --> 1:15:42.277
Again?

1:15:42.455 --> 1:15:43.786
Yes.

1:15:43.957 --> 1:15:47.324
He was gone all day yesterday
and did not return until dawn.

1:15:48.962 --> 1:15:50.202
Well!

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:53.213
It must be marvelous
to have that kind of stamina.

1:15:53.383 --> 1:15:56.466
Perhaps you could help
solve a mystery for me.

1:15:56.636 --> 1:15:59.002
Do you know the Comtesse de Lancret?

1:15:59.180 --> 1:16:03.765
Apparently she's staying with a cousin,
but nobody seems to know who.

1:16:08.481 --> 1:16:10.392
Nicole... de Lancret?

1:16:10.567 --> 1:16:11.932
Yes.

1:16:12.110 --> 1:16:14.146
Oh, how wonderful!

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.312
I was beginning to think she was a ghost.

1:16:19.117 --> 1:16:20.653
No.

1:16:20.827 --> 1:16:23.819
I'm afraid she's been around for years. Yes.

1:16:23.997 --> 1:16:25.032
And erm...

1:16:25.206 --> 1:16:28.369
staying with us, as a matter of fact.

1:16:28.543 --> 1:16:30.534
Isn't that right, darling?

1:16:30.712 --> 1:16:33.454
Yes! Of course.

1:16:33.631 --> 1:16:35.792
Our cousin.

1:16:37.552 --> 1:16:40.760
Whom you like to call Cinderella.

1:17:01.868 --> 1:17:03.950
Good heavens, child.

1:17:04.621 --> 1:17:06.703
Are you all right?

1:17:08.082 --> 1:17:10.164
There was a bee.

1:17:39.906 --> 1:17:41.771
Hello.

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:43.906
Hello.

1:17:51.543 --> 1:17:53.329
Are you well?

1:17:53.503 --> 1:17:57.246
I fear that I am not myself today.

1:17:57.423 --> 1:18:02.087
I feel as if my skin is the only thing
keeping me from going everywhere at once.

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:05.424
There is something I must tell you.

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:06.758
And I you.

1:18:06.933 --> 1:18:10.926
Oh, here. Your book,
you left it in the carriage yesterday.

1:18:11.104 --> 1:18:13.186
- Your Highness...
- Henry.

1:18:16.192 --> 1:18:18.808
I cannot stay long, but I had to see you.

1:18:20.780 --> 1:18:22.816
There is much to say.

1:18:22.991 --> 1:18:24.527
Come.

1:18:24.701 --> 1:18:27.192
I want to show you something.

1:18:32.625 --> 1:18:34.661
I used to play here as a boy.

1:18:37.297 --> 1:18:40.585
It was my father's most cherished retreat

1:18:40.758 --> 1:18:42.498
before the war.

1:18:52.937 --> 1:18:55.269
It's beautiful.

1:18:58.151 --> 1:19:00.893
I've measured my life by these trees,

1:19:02.530 --> 1:19:04.566
starting here,

1:19:04.741 --> 1:19:06.572
all the way up there.

1:19:06.743 --> 1:19:08.483
And still they grow.

1:19:08.661 --> 1:19:11.038
So much life to live,

1:19:15.627 --> 1:19:17.993
but I no longer imagine it alone.

1:19:19.756 --> 1:19:21.838
You're not making this easy.

1:19:22.759 --> 1:19:26.923
I have not slept for fear I would wake
to find all this a dream.

1:19:29.682 --> 1:19:32.845
Oh, last night, I had a revelation.

1:19:34.312 --> 1:19:38.430
I used to think, if I cared at all,
I would have to care about everything,

1:19:38.608 --> 1:19:40.348
and I'd go stark raving mad.

1:19:40.526 --> 1:19:43.518
But... now I've found my purpose.

1:19:45.073 --> 1:19:47.906
It's a project actually inspired by you.

1:19:49.494 --> 1:19:51.530
I feel

1:19:51.704 --> 1:19:53.695
the most wonderful...

1:19:54.290 --> 1:19:56.326
freedom.

1:19:56.501 --> 1:19:58.537
It wasn't me.

1:20:01.506 --> 1:20:03.542
Nicole.

1:20:03.716 --> 1:20:06.674
You are unlike any courtier I have ever met.

1:20:08.179 --> 1:20:10.215
Tomorrow, at the masque,

1:20:10.390 --> 1:20:12.881
I shall make it known to the world.

1:20:15.395 --> 1:20:18.262
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

1:20:22.402 --> 1:20:24.518
Now, then.

1:20:25.405 --> 1:20:27.691
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1:20:34.205 --> 1:20:36.241
Simply that

1:20:36.416 --> 1:20:40.284
last night was the happiest night of my life.

1:20:55.059 --> 1:20:56.435
Ow!

1:21:02.025 --> 1:21:03.981
I must go.

1:21:04.152 --> 1:21:05.608
Nicole!

1:21:05.778 --> 1:21:06.767
No.

1:21:24.797 --> 1:21:28.460
Of all the insidious jokes,
making your mother a comtesse.

1:21:28.634 --> 1:21:33.469
It's almost as absurd as a prince
frequenting a servant who sleeps with pigs!

1:21:33.639 --> 1:21:36.176
What bothers you more, Stepmother?

1:21:36.350 --> 1:21:39.137
That I am common,
or that I am competition?

1:21:39.312 --> 1:21:41.018
Where is the dress, Danielle?

1:21:41.189 --> 1:21:43.180
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:21:43.357 --> 1:21:45.313
The gown. The slippers?

1:21:45.485 --> 1:21:47.851
They were in my room
and now they're gone.

1:21:48.029 --> 1:21:50.020
You hid them, I know it!

1:21:54.827 --> 1:21:58.319
Where are the candlesticks
and the tapestries

1:21:58.498 --> 1:21:59.988
and the silver?

1:22:00.166 --> 1:22:01.531
Perhaps the dress is with them!

1:22:01.709 --> 1:22:03.540
You produce that gown!

1:22:03.711 --> 1:22:06.043
I would rather die a thousand deaths

1:22:06.214 --> 1:22:11.254
than to see my mother's dress
on that spoiled, selfish cow!

1:22:15.473 --> 1:22:18.135
Hmm. Perhaps we can arrange that.

1:22:20.353 --> 1:22:22.435
Get in there.

1:22:28.111 --> 1:22:29.897
Open this door,

1:22:30.071 --> 1:22:32.483
and you'll wish you never set foot here.

1:22:32.657 --> 1:22:35.069
Ladies, gather everything we can sell.

1:22:35.243 --> 1:22:37.108
We're going to town tomorrow.

1:22:37.286 --> 1:22:39.493
Mother,... it's only a ball.

1:22:39.664 --> 1:22:42.371
Yes, and you're only going for the food.

1:22:47.380 --> 1:22:49.371
Engaged?

1:22:49.549 --> 1:22:51.380
To a Belgian?

1:22:51.551 --> 1:22:53.416
I'm afraid so.

1:22:53.594 --> 1:22:56.006
Impossible.
There has to be some mistake.

1:22:56.180 --> 1:22:59.547
She was traveling by boat this afternoon.

1:23:01.185 --> 1:23:05.053
Baroness Rodmilla
was quite reluctant to talk about it.

1:23:05.231 --> 1:23:07.938
It's no wonder, with tidings such as these.

1:23:08.109 --> 1:23:12.148
If she was betrothed, she should
have had the decency to tell me!

1:23:12.321 --> 1:23:14.061
Would you have listened?

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:16.276
Of course not! I would have...

1:23:17.577 --> 1:23:19.613
Oh, God.

1:23:19.787 --> 1:23:22.244
How could I have been so blind?

1:23:22.415 --> 1:23:25.157
There I was, pouring my royal heart out

1:23:25.334 --> 1:23:28.417
and she was simply trying
to bid me farewell.

1:23:28.588 --> 1:23:32.126
It is a strong woman
who can keep her wits about her

1:23:32.300 --> 1:23:34.791
with you trying to steal her heart.

1:23:34.969 --> 1:23:38.757
Yes.
And what a clumsy thief I turned out to be.

1:23:38.931 --> 1:23:40.922
Come now, Henry.

1:23:41.350 --> 1:23:44.433
Any choice is better than Spain.

1:23:48.107 --> 1:23:50.814
Go to the Prince, tell him what's happened.

1:23:50.985 --> 1:23:53.818
B-But I'm nobody.
The Prince would never see me.

1:23:53.988 --> 1:23:55.979
You are her friend, Gustave.

1:23:56.157 --> 1:23:59.445
She needs your help.
The Prince expects to see her.

1:23:59.619 --> 1:24:00.654
Llcannot

1:24:00.828 --> 1:24:03.444
Besides, my master has me working tonight.

1:24:03.623 --> 1:24:07.081
Then go to da Vinci.
Surely a painter can see another painter?

1:24:07.251 --> 1:24:12.621
I am but an apprentice, and he is
the greatest painter in the world.

1:24:12.798 --> 1:24:14.789
I could no sooner talk to God.

1:24:14.967 --> 1:24:17.299
For once in your life, man, be bold.

1:24:37.365 --> 1:24:39.856
This way, sir.

1:24:40.034 --> 1:24:42.070
Straight up there, madam.

1:25:08.354 --> 1:25:10.265
Yoo-hoo!

1:25:19.365 --> 1:25:21.447
I wanted to be the peacock.

1:25:21.617 --> 1:25:25.075
Jacqueline, the horse is
one of God's noblest creatures.

1:25:25.246 --> 1:25:27.453
Why don't I just pull the carriage?

1:25:27.623 --> 1:25:29.864
If it will get us there any faster.

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:06.901
I'm looking for Signor da Vinci.

1:26:19.550 --> 1:26:21.632
Signor da Vinci!

1:26:24.263 --> 1:26:25.969
Yes?

1:26:27.058 --> 1:26:28.969
Oh!

1:26:29.143 --> 1:26:31.099
Oh, mistress, it's no use!

1:26:31.270 --> 1:26:32.305
Allow me.

1:26:41.781 --> 1:26:44.443
Oh, brilliant!

1:26:44.617 --> 1:26:46.323
Why, that was pure genius.

1:26:46.494 --> 1:26:47.609
Yes.

1:26:47.787 --> 1:26:51.279
I shall go down in history
as the man who opened a door.

1:26:51.707 --> 1:26:53.743
Gustave!

1:26:53.918 --> 1:26:56.785
Maurice said the Prince was expecting you.

1:26:56.962 --> 1:26:59.874
He is expecting someone
who does not exist.

1:27:00.049 --> 1:27:02.791
Signore,
my name is Danielle de Barbarac

1:27:02.968 --> 1:27:04.629
and I am but a servant.

1:27:04.804 --> 1:27:07.967
I am the bastard son of a peasant.
What does that matter?

1:27:08.140 --> 1:27:10.631
I have deceived him.

1:27:10.810 --> 1:27:12.801
The Prince will understand.

1:27:13.145 --> 1:27:16.228
The night is young.
We must get you ready for the ball.

1:27:16.399 --> 1:27:19.015
- I do not wish to go.
- If you stay,

1:27:19.193 --> 1:27:20.558
the Baroness wins.

1:27:22.113 --> 1:27:24.274
How can I face him?

1:27:24.448 --> 1:27:28.032
Because he deserves
to hear the truth from the one he loves.

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:31.987
A bird may love a fish, signore,

1:27:32.164 --> 1:27:34.155
but where would they live?

1:27:34.333 --> 1:27:37.621
Then I shall have to make you wings.

1:27:38.712 --> 1:27:41.499
Ooh, come on! No time to waste.

1:27:41.674 --> 1:27:43.710
Louise, get the dress!

1:27:51.267 --> 1:27:53.633
I understand you wanted to see me.

1:27:54.353 --> 1:27:56.389
Yes, Father. I did.

1:28:03.195 --> 1:28:05.277
Listen, Henry.

1:28:06.198 --> 1:28:10.532
Perhaps it was unfair of me
to put so much pressure on you

1:28:10.703 --> 1:28:12.944
about the marriage contract.

1:28:13.747 --> 1:28:17.740
I just thought it was time
to make some changes in your life.

1:28:17.918 --> 1:28:20.580
You seemed to be a bit... floundering.

1:28:21.881 --> 1:28:23.462
And er...

1:28:23.632 --> 1:28:26.089
Well, I-I just wanted to say

1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:29.468
that this university thing

1:28:30.306 --> 1:28:32.388
is a brilliant idea.

1:28:34.226 --> 1:28:37.434
We don't have to announce
anything tonight...

1:28:37.605 --> 1:28:39.812
I've made my decision.

1:28:41.609 --> 1:28:43.691
Oh.

1:29:02.671 --> 1:29:04.707
She looks like a masterpiece.

1:29:04.882 --> 1:29:06.873
She looks like her mother.

1:29:07.051 --> 1:29:09.713
- Come, let us see your paintings.
- Now?

1:29:09.887 --> 1:29:12.924
When you're as old as I am,
now is all you've got.

1:29:13.098 --> 1:29:14.178
Wait!

1:29:14.350 --> 1:29:16.557
It's tradition.

1:29:52.972 --> 1:29:55.054
Whoa!

1:30:12.866 --> 1:30:14.481
This is it, my darling.

1:30:16.787 --> 1:30:18.152
Friends,

1:30:18.330 --> 1:30:20.321
honored guests.

1:30:21.166 --> 1:30:23.202
It gives us great pleasure...

1:30:24.169 --> 1:30:26.330
on this festive occasion,

1:30:26.505 --> 1:30:31.795
not only to honor Signor da Vinci,
who seems to have disappeared,

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:36.178
but also to tell you
of a long-awaited decision.

1:30:36.932 --> 1:30:38.843
So, without further ado,...

1:30:39.018 --> 1:30:41.851
Breathe, just breathe.

1:30:42.021 --> 1:30:45.764
it is my great privilege
to announce the engagement of our son,

1:30:45.941 --> 1:30:47.897
Prince Henry,

1:30:48.068 --> 1:30:50.150
to...

1:31:23.937 --> 1:31:25.928
Well, well, well.

1:31:26.106 --> 1:31:28.392
What have we here?

1:31:28.567 --> 1:31:30.899
My mother said you were getting married.

1:31:31.070 --> 1:31:33.106
She was misinformed.

1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:37.899
But there is something I must tell you now,
before another word is spoken.

1:31:38.077 --> 1:31:40.159
Then you're not engaged?

1:31:40.329 --> 1:31:41.944
No, I'm not.

1:31:43.040 --> 1:31:46.282
I was about to make
the worst mistake of my life.

1:31:47.002 --> 1:31:49.163
Who is she?

1:31:49.338 --> 1:31:52.205
My guess would be
the Comtesse de Lancret.

1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:56.796
The who?

1:31:58.972 --> 1:32:01.304
Come. I want you to meet someone.

1:32:01.475 --> 1:32:03.306
Oh, I must speak with you.

1:32:03.477 --> 1:32:07.140
- Whatever it is, my answer is yes.
- No, wait, please.

1:32:09.775 --> 1:32:11.982
Oh, look. I invited the Gypsies.

1:32:12.736 --> 1:32:15.603
- What are you doing?
- Making you a princess.

1:32:19.827 --> 1:32:22.113
- How dare you!
- Madame, contain yourself!

1:32:22.287 --> 1:32:24.243
- She is an impostor, Sire!
- No!

1:32:24.415 --> 1:32:26.781
Her name is Danielle de Barbarac.

1:32:26.959 --> 1:32:29.621
She has been my servant for ten years.

1:32:29.795 --> 1:32:33.083
A servant, Henry?
Is this some kind ofjoke?

1:32:34.466 --> 1:32:37.128
Baroness, you are on dangerous ground!

1:32:37.302 --> 1:32:38.587
Ask her yourself!

1:32:38.762 --> 1:32:42.471
She's a grasping, devious little pretender

1:32:42.641 --> 1:32:46.634
and it is my duty to expose her
as the covetous hoax she is.

1:32:46.812 --> 1:32:48.848
Tell these women who you are.

1:32:50.190 --> 1:32:51.976
Tell them!

1:32:58.031 --> 1:33:01.023
Bow before royalty, you insolent fraud!

1:33:01.201 --> 1:33:03.863
My God, it can't be true.

1:33:07.833 --> 1:33:09.915
Nicole?

1:33:12.504 --> 1:33:15.291
Nicole de Lancret was my mother.

1:33:15.883 --> 1:33:18.625
I am what she says.

1:33:26.226 --> 1:33:28.308
The apple?

1:33:30.105 --> 1:33:32.141
That was you?

1:33:32.316 --> 1:33:34.272
I can explain.

1:33:34.443 --> 1:33:37.025
Well, someone had better!

1:33:37.196 --> 1:33:39.528
First, you're engaged,

1:33:40.866 --> 1:33:43.608
and now you're a servant?

1:33:44.536 --> 1:33:46.527
I've heard enough.

1:33:46.705 --> 1:33:48.115
Henry, please!

1:33:55.088 --> 1:33:59.331
Do not address me so informal, madam.

1:34:00.219 --> 1:34:02.551
I am a Prince of France.

1:34:02.721 --> 1:34:05.212
And you

1:34:05.390 --> 1:34:07.881
are just like them.

1:34:55.816 --> 1:34:57.932
Danielle?

1:34:59.528 --> 1:35:01.814
Danielle!

1:35:13.792 --> 1:35:15.828
What have you done?

1:35:16.003 --> 1:35:19.791
I was born to privilege
and with that come specific obligations.

1:35:19.965 --> 1:35:21.080
Horseshit.

1:35:21.258 --> 1:35:25.297
- You're out of line, old man.
- No, you are out of line.

1:35:25.470 --> 1:35:28.837
Have you any idea what she went through
to get here tonight?

1:35:29.016 --> 1:35:30.472
She lied to me.

1:35:30.642 --> 1:35:33.850
She came to tell you the truth
and you fed her to the wolves.

1:35:34.021 --> 1:35:35.136
What do you know?

1:35:35.314 --> 1:35:38.306
You build flying machines
and walk on water.

1:35:38.483 --> 1:35:40.474
Yet you know nothing about life.

1:35:40.652 --> 1:35:43.314
I know that a life without love

1:35:43.488 --> 1:35:45.103
is no life at all.

1:35:45.282 --> 1:35:47.238
And love without trust?

1:35:47.409 --> 1:35:48.489
What of that?

1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:50.742
She's your match, Henry.

1:35:50.913 --> 1:35:53.154
I am but a servant to my crown

1:35:53.332 --> 1:35:56.324
and I have made my decision.

1:35:56.501 --> 1:35:58.537
| will not yield!

1:36:04.801 --> 1:36:06.883
Then you don't deserve her.

1:37:24.965 --> 1:37:27.172
I have it on good authority

1:37:27.342 --> 1:37:30.709
that before your rather embarrassing debut

1:37:30.887 --> 1:37:34.721
the Prince was about to choose
Marguerite to be his bride.

1:37:36.143 --> 1:37:38.384
Men are so fickle, aren't they?

1:37:38.562 --> 1:37:41.429
One minute, they're spouting sonnets,

1:37:41.606 --> 1:37:44.973
and the next you're back
to being a hired help.

1:37:45.152 --> 1:37:49.395
I must say, I've never seen you
quite this dedicated in your chores.

1:37:49.573 --> 1:37:52.531
What makes you think
I do any of this for you?

1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:56.243
Well, my, my, my.
Aren't we feisty this morning?

1:37:56.413 --> 1:37:58.244
Let me pass.

1:37:58.415 --> 1:38:01.623
- You've brought this on yourself.
- I have work to do.

1:38:01.793 --> 1:38:03.579
Let the others handle it.

1:38:05.756 --> 1:38:07.792
Don't you understand?

1:38:07.966 --> 1:38:09.467
You've won!

1:38:09.634 --> 1:38:11.625
Go and move into your palace

1:38:11.803 --> 1:38:13.885
and leave us be!

1:38:15.515 --> 1:38:18.348
You are not my problem anymore.

1:38:19.895 --> 1:38:21.977
Is that what I am?

1:38:22.147 --> 1:38:24.138
Your problem?

1:38:25.108 --> 1:38:28.271
I have done everything
you've ever asked me to do

1:38:28.445 --> 1:38:31.983
and still you've denied me
the only thing I ever wanted.

1:38:32.157 --> 1:38:34.113
And what was that?

1:38:34.284 --> 1:38:36.320
What do you think?

1:38:38.497 --> 1:38:41.330
You are the only mother I have ever known.

1:38:43.043 --> 1:38:46.831
Was there a time,
even in its smallest measurement,

1:38:47.005 --> 1:38:48.791
that you loved me at all?

1:38:48.965 --> 1:38:53.334
How can anyone love a pebble
in their shoe?

1:39:02.437 --> 1:39:04.473
Danielle!

1:39:04.648 --> 1:39:06.639
My lady, come and see!

1:39:06.817 --> 1:39:08.853
It's back, all of it!

1:39:20.664 --> 1:39:22.746
You, take that chair.

1:39:26.795 --> 1:39:28.831
Ah, Monsieur le Pieu.

1:39:29.005 --> 1:39:32.247
- Right on time.
- It's all here, Baroness,

1:39:32.425 --> 1:39:35.383
right down to the very last candlestick.

1:39:36.429 --> 1:39:38.636
Father's books? His paintings?

1:39:38.807 --> 1:39:40.763
You sold them to him?

1:39:40.934 --> 1:39:42.970
Yes. And now they're back.

1:39:43.145 --> 1:39:47.434
I couldn't have us looking like paupers
when the King arrives.

1:39:49.901 --> 1:39:51.937
Thank you, Monsieur.

1:39:52.112 --> 1:39:54.148
This means the world to us.

1:39:54.322 --> 1:39:56.574
I'm a businessman, Danielle,

1:39:56.741 --> 1:39:58.993
not a philanthropist.

1:39:59.161 --> 1:40:00.697
I don't understand.

1:40:00.871 --> 1:40:04.238
I couldn't have you around
distracting the Prince.

1:40:04.416 --> 1:40:08.079
The Baroness and I have come to er...

1:40:08.253 --> 1:40:10.209
an arrangement.

1:40:10.380 --> 1:40:11.540
You, for all this,

1:40:11.715 --> 1:40:15.503
although I do think
I'm getting the better end of the deal.

1:40:16.678 --> 1:40:18.964
No! No!

1:40:19.139 --> 1:40:21.221
- No!
- Danielle!

1:43:01.801 --> 1:43:04.417
Madame, madame.

1:43:06.264 --> 1:43:08.880
I know exactly how you feel.

1:43:13.188 --> 1:43:15.930
Don Pepito! Don Pepito!

1:43:30.288 --> 1:43:32.324
And I thought I had problems.

1:43:54.813 --> 1:43:56.724
Where is she?

1:43:56.898 --> 1:43:58.058
The Baroness?

1:43:58.233 --> 1:44:00.224
Ni... Danielle.

1:44:01.486 --> 1:44:03.147
But she has been sold, Sire.

1:44:03.780 --> 1:44:05.361
Sold?

1:44:05.532 --> 1:44:07.147
To whom?

1:44:07.325 --> 1:44:09.156
Pierre le Pieu, Your Highness.

1:44:09.327 --> 1:44:11.318
Just after the masque.

1:44:14.124 --> 1:44:16.240
Tell no-one we have spoken.

1:44:16.709 --> 1:44:19.576
For all shall reveal itself in due course.

1:44:19.754 --> 1:44:21.494
Come, Laurent.

1:44:21.673 --> 1:44:23.709
There is much to be done.

1:44:34.102 --> 1:44:36.093
Enter!

1:44:38.481 --> 1:44:41.564
Oh, I do so hate to see you in irons.

1:44:41.734 --> 1:44:43.861
I'd remove them

1:44:44.028 --> 1:44:47.020
if only you'd promise not to run away again.

1:44:47.198 --> 1:44:49.189
I have no reason to stay.

1:44:49.367 --> 1:44:51.858
You belong to me now.

1:44:52.036 --> 1:44:54.072
I belong to no-one,

1:44:54.247 --> 1:44:56.238
least of all you.

1:44:56.416 --> 1:45:00.125
Oh, I do wish you'd reconsider my offer.

1:45:00.295 --> 1:45:02.286
I would rather rot.

1:45:02.464 --> 1:45:06.048
I had a horse like you once.
A magnificent creature.

1:45:06.217 --> 1:45:08.208
Stubborn, just like you.

1:45:08.386 --> 1:45:10.502
Willful to a fault.

1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:13.467
It, too, just needed to be

1:45:13.641 --> 1:45:15.051
broken.

1:45:18.813 --> 1:45:22.522
You will maintain your distance, sir.

1:45:22.692 --> 1:45:24.978
Oh, you didn't say please.

1:45:27.906 --> 1:45:29.612
Please.

1:45:29.782 --> 1:45:32.239
I could hang you for this.

1:45:32.410 --> 1:45:34.401
Not if you are dead.

1:45:34.579 --> 1:45:38.367
I do love your spirit.

1:45:47.050 --> 1:45:50.588
My father was an expert swordsman,
Monsieur.

1:45:50.762 --> 1:45:52.047
He taught me well.

1:45:52.222 --> 1:45:57.262
Now hand me that key,
or I swear on his grave I will slit you

1:45:57.435 --> 1:46:00.427
from navel to nose.

1:46:16.538 --> 1:46:18.620
Your freedom,

1:46:18.790 --> 1:46:20.826
my lady.

1:46:47.735 --> 1:46:49.111
Hello.

1:46:49.654 --> 1:46:51.019
Hello.

1:46:54.242 --> 1:46:56.324
What are you doing here?

1:46:57.662 --> 1:46:59.744
Ierm...

1:47:00.665 --> 1:47:02.701
I came to rescue you.

1:47:02.875 --> 1:47:04.831
Rescue me?

1:47:05.003 --> 1:47:07.369
A commoner?

1:47:09.173 --> 1:47:12.040
Actually, I came to beg your forgiveness.

1:47:12.218 --> 1:47:16.507
I offered you the world,
and at the first test of honor I betrayed you.

1:47:16.681 --> 1:47:18.717
Please, Danielle.

1:47:23.062 --> 1:47:25.018
Say it again.

1:47:25.189 --> 1:47:27.566
I'm sorry.

1:47:27.734 --> 1:47:29.770
No.

1:47:30.820 --> 1:47:33.607
The part where you said my name.

1:47:35.908 --> 1:47:37.990
Danielle.

1:47:41.372 --> 1:47:43.363
Perhaps you would be so kind

1:47:43.541 --> 1:47:46.157
as to help me find the owner of this

1:47:46.336 --> 1:47:49.123
rather remarkable shoe?

1:47:51.007 --> 1:47:53.293
Where did you find that?

1:47:53.468 --> 1:47:56.301
She is my match in every way.

1:47:58.222 --> 1:48:00.713
Please tell me I haven't lost her.

1:48:02.810 --> 1:48:06.394
It belongs to a peasant, Your Highness,

1:48:06.564 --> 1:48:09.476
who pretended to be a courtier
to save a man's life.

1:48:09.651 --> 1:48:11.733
Yes, I know.

1:48:12.612 --> 1:48:15.399
And the name's Henry, if you don't mind.

1:48:28.461 --> 1:48:31.248
I kneel before you not as a prince,

1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:34.422
but as a man in love.

1:48:37.637 --> 1:48:39.673
But I

1:48:39.847 --> 1:48:42.259
would feel like a king...

1:48:43.351 --> 1:48:46.593
if you, Danielle de Barbarac...

1:48:49.273 --> 1:48:51.434
would be my wife.

1:49:22.181 --> 1:49:24.718
How was I to know
he'd run out of the side door?

1:49:24.892 --> 1:49:26.974
He was supposed to be getting married!

1:49:27.145 --> 1:49:30.478
I heard the Prince talked to you.
What did he say?

1:49:31.190 --> 1:49:33.272
Well, I can't be sure.

1:49:33.693 --> 1:49:35.729
It all happened so quickly.

1:49:35.903 --> 1:49:37.894
But I think what he said was,

1:49:38.072 --> 1:49:41.815
"It serves me right
for choosing a foreigner over your...

1:49:41.993 --> 1:49:44.029
sister."

1:49:46.998 --> 1:49:49.660
Well, very good.

1:49:49.834 --> 1:49:53.543
Perhaps we should just
let him fret about it for a few days.

1:49:55.506 --> 1:49:57.542
I'll get it!

1:49:59.177 --> 1:50:01.793
His Supreme Majesty, King Francis,

1:50:01.971 --> 1:50:06.180
requests an audience with
the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent

1:50:06.350 --> 1:50:08.090
and her daughters immediately.

1:50:08.269 --> 1:50:10.430
Oh. Is anything wrong?

1:50:10.605 --> 1:50:12.516
No, milady.

1:50:12.690 --> 1:50:15.807
The King demanded that you arrive in style.

1:50:15.985 --> 1:50:18.977
Hmm! In style we shall be.

1:50:49.602 --> 1:50:52.435
Baroness,

1:50:52.605 --> 1:50:57.065
did you or did you not
lie to Her Majesty the Queen of France?

1:50:59.362 --> 1:51:02.570
Choose your words wisely, madame,

1:51:02.740 --> 1:51:04.731
for they may be your last.

1:51:10.206 --> 1:51:12.743
A woman would do practically anything

1:51:12.917 --> 1:51:15.909
for the love of her daughter, Your Majesties.

1:51:17.797 --> 1:51:21.164
Perhaps I did get a little carried away.

1:51:21.342 --> 1:51:23.298
Mother, what have you done?

1:51:23.469 --> 1:51:26.176
Your Majesty, like you,
I am just a victim here.

1:51:26.347 --> 1:51:29.589
She has lied to us both
and I am ashamed to call her family.

1:51:29.767 --> 1:51:31.974
How dare you turn on me, you ingrate!

1:51:32.144 --> 1:51:34.100
You see what I have to put up with!

1:51:34.272 --> 1:51:36.228
Silence, both of you!

1:51:36.399 --> 1:51:37.764
Good Lord!

1:51:37.942 --> 1:51:39.432
Are they always like this?

1:51:39.610 --> 1:51:40.770
Worse,

1:51:40.945 --> 1:51:42.481
Your Majesty.

1:51:42.655 --> 1:51:44.646
Jacqueline, darling,

1:51:44.824 --> 1:51:47.816
I'd hate to think
you had anything to do with this.

1:51:47.994 --> 1:51:49.404
Of course not, Mother.

1:51:49.579 --> 1:51:51.945
I'm only here for the food.

1:51:52.832 --> 1:51:54.618
Baroness de Ghent.

1:51:54.792 --> 1:51:57.283
You are forthwith stripped of your title.

1:51:57.461 --> 1:51:59.497
You and your horrible daughter

1:51:59.672 --> 1:52:02.755
are to be shipped to the Americas
on the first boat.

1:52:02.925 --> 1:52:04.916
Unless, by some miracle,

1:52:05.094 --> 1:52:08.177
someone here will speak for you.

1:52:30.202 --> 1:52:33.660
There seem to be
quite a few people out of town.

1:52:34.373 --> 1:52:36.705
I will speak for her.

1:52:48.512 --> 1:52:51.675
She is, after all, my stepmother.

1:53:16.207 --> 1:53:18.289
Your Highness.

1:53:22.713 --> 1:53:24.704
Marguerite,

1:53:26.092 --> 1:53:28.629
I don't believe you've met...

1:53:28.803 --> 1:53:30.213
my wife.

1:53:31.305 --> 1:53:33.341
I want you to know

1:53:33.516 --> 1:53:36.098
that I will forget you after this moment

1:53:36.268 --> 1:53:38.099
and never think of you again.

1:53:38.270 --> 1:53:40.602
But you, I am quite certain,

1:53:40.773 --> 1:53:45.312
will think about me
every single day for the rest of your life.

1:53:47.655 --> 1:53:49.737
How long might that be?

1:53:56.664 --> 1:53:58.780
All I ask, Your Majesties,

1:53:59.667 --> 1:54:05.128
is that you show her the same courtesy
that she has bestowed upon me.

1:54:14.348 --> 1:54:18.591
After you've washed the tablecloths,
start on the napkins

1:54:18.769 --> 1:54:21.101
and move those over there.

1:54:21.272 --> 1:54:23.263
- Marguerite.
- What?

1:54:23.441 --> 1:54:25.523
- You heard the woman.
- So did you.

1:54:25.693 --> 1:54:28.856
- Yes, but I'm management.
- Like hell you are!

1:54:29.030 --> 1:54:32.522
You're just the same as me, a big nobody!

1:54:32.700 --> 1:54:35.191
How dare you speak that way!
I am of noble blood.

1:54:35.369 --> 1:54:37.781
And you are getting on my nerves!

1:54:44.628 --> 1:54:47.210
Now get to work.

1:55:00.853 --> 1:55:02.093
Leonardo.

1:55:02.271 --> 1:55:04.637
It's wonderful.

1:55:04.815 --> 1:55:08.979
Think of it as a belated wedding present,
Your Highness.

1:55:11.197 --> 1:55:12.903
What?

1:55:13.074 --> 1:55:15.315
I just can't get over it... Your Highness.

1:55:15.493 --> 1:55:17.108
Yes, well, royalty or not,

1:55:17.286 --> 1:55:19.277
I can still whip you.

1:55:21.373 --> 1:55:23.284
I must say, Leonardo,

1:55:23.459 --> 1:55:25.575
for a man of your talents,

1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:28.752
it doesn't look a thing like her.

1:55:29.673 --> 1:55:32.961
You, sir, are supposed to be charming.

1:55:33.135 --> 1:55:36.423
And we, Princess,
are supposed to live happily ever after.

1:55:36.597 --> 1:55:38.633
Says who?

1:55:40.559 --> 1:55:42.550
Do you know,

1:55:42.728 --> 1:55:44.810
I don't know.

1:55:53.405 --> 1:55:58.149
My great—great—grandmother's
portrait hung in the university

1:55:58.327 --> 1:56:00.363
up until the revolution.

1:56:01.580 --> 1:56:04.447
By then, the truth of the romance

1:56:04.792 --> 1:56:07.784
had been reduced to a simple fairy tale.

1:56:09.505 --> 1:56:15.717
And while Cinderella and her Prince
did live happily ever after,

1:56:16.846 --> 1:56:18.882
the point, gentlemen,

1:56:19.056 --> 1:56:21.047
is that they lived.
