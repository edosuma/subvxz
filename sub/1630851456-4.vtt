[static buzzing]

00:12.200 --> 00:14.080
First, I would like to make it very clear

00:14.160 --> 00:18.320
that I'm not a danger
or a threat to society or anyone else.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.280
I left in self-defense.

00:20.360 --> 00:24.280
I have a genuine fear
for my personal safety.

00:24.360 --> 00:29.400
And all I can do is wait until
the legal system works itself out,

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
I'm a victim of their politics.

[reporter 3] For Milligan, this change
in his treatment at the hospital

01:45.320 --> 01:47.520
is a ploy to keep him institutionalized.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.760
[train cars rattling]

02:04.560 --> 02:08.320
Billy Milligan's escape was
reported to the, uh, state highway patrol,

02:08.920 --> 02:12.480
and then it was handled locally
through the local troopers

02:12.560 --> 02:15.000
and I got involved, I think, the next day.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.920
[reporter 3] Milligan ran away on Friday,
he is now searched all over the state.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.720
It was over a July 4th period of time

02:22.800 --> 02:25.120
where there would be fewer staff.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.720
And that Dr. Lindner
decided that he was going to

02:29.800 --> 02:33.320
adjust Billy's medications'
back to the stuff…

02:33.400 --> 02:35.600
the psychotropics that were not good.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.800
I mean, and he's under Dr. Lindner again.

The person who was
responsible for the Thorazine

02:46.120 --> 02:48.440

02:50.320 --> 02:54.160
I just thought he would be gone for,
you know, a couple days at the most.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.400
Uh, there was
considerable media attention.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.680
He had a lot of attorneys.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.080
He had a lot of doctors.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.880
In my gut, ever since
the beginning of time with this case,

03:11.960 --> 03:14.200
I've… I've sensed a tragic ending

03:14.280 --> 03:16.080
and I hope my gut feelings are wrong.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.800
And we have to get him back.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.360
I have been informed
by his treating psychiatrist

03:20.440 --> 03:22.480
that if and when that medication runs out,

03:22.560 --> 03:24.760
he could fragment
and then become very dangerous.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.240
No one needs to be afraid of Billy…

03:27.880 --> 03:30.760
because if any one
of these personalities are out,

03:30.840 --> 03:35.160
you really have to know Billy
to detect the personalities.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.120
They can be out,
but they're not dangerous.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.520
I'm not concerned for public safety at all

03:41.600 --> 03:43.840
because even…
he's learned to deal with that before

03:43.920 --> 03:46.400
in a few states and he's not violent,

03:46.480 --> 03:50.360
but I am very concerned about himself
as far as getting very depressed,

03:50.440 --> 03:52.120
maybe doing something to himself.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.600
Being a friend of Billy Milligan
was always putting yourself

03:56.680 --> 03:57.680
into a moral dilemma.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.880
Not always, but many, many times I felt,

03:59.960 --> 04:02.160
"Should I cross the state line or not?"

04:05.040 --> 04:07.440
His escape was well-planned.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.560
He had assistance from Mr. Murray.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.680
He'd been in
communication with his attorneys,

04:12.760 --> 04:14.320
with the State public defender.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.880
Billy… He was just going away
from the hospital for the weekend.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.760
So my feeling was that

04:20.840 --> 04:24.440
he was probably going
to go back on Monday or Tuesday.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.680
You know, soon.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.160
I suggested that he make a video

04:34.000 --> 04:35.440
and I would record it

04:35.520 --> 04:38.560
and have him explain
why he had left the hospital.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.640
And that he had not escaped.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.840
He did not hold anybody prisoner.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.240
He just simply walked out,
which he always did.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.920
It seems that my treatment,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.240
that my commitment

04:50.320 --> 04:52.200
and everything else to the institution

04:52.280 --> 04:55.040
has become an issue of politics.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.600
I don't think they really care
what is best for me or society

04:59.680 --> 05:03.520
or the individual
at the institution at this point.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.440
And then I called each of the news media

05:05.520 --> 05:08.640
and told them that there
was a videotape from Billy Milligan…

05:12.800 --> 05:14.360
in locker number 28.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.720
It seemed like
the Billy Milligan story would never end.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.800
When interest started to die on him,

05:21.880 --> 05:25.440
he would do some crazy thing
that would put him in the headlines again.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.360
[reporter 4] There is concern
that one of his 24 separate personalities

05:30.440 --> 05:31.720
takes control of him.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.720
And what if this personality
is not a peaceful person

05:34.800 --> 05:36.360
but a violent one?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.600
It came to a point

05:44.680 --> 05:48.720
that I, also in addition to
being with Billy and protecting him,

05:48.800 --> 05:52.640
I was in touch with people
who wanted to bring him back.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.920
And Billy had two main lawyers.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.320
One was Randy Dana
and his boss was Gary Schweickart,

05:58.400 --> 06:00.120
but it had to be done in a way

06:00.200 --> 06:02.320
that was satisfactory to everyone.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.000
Billy wanted his treatment team
to have charge of his medications.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.040
He wanted a judge to rule on that.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.160
He had conditions he started setting up

06:10.240 --> 06:13.920
as to when and why
he would choose to come back,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.240
but that wasn't happening very quickly.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.760
He called me
to let me know that he was okay

06:18.840 --> 06:22.400
and that he just could not
take the pressure from the media

06:22.480 --> 06:24.680
and the fighting of the doctors

06:24.760 --> 06:28.120
and the discrepancies
in all the medications.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.560
It was making him crazy.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.160
[Murray] And I don't know
who came up with this idea.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.880
Probably-- maybe me.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.360
I realized that, you know…

06:36.080 --> 06:39.800
it might be better if Billy
were outside the state right now.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.880
So, the plan, I think…
Originally, it was I rented a car

06:45.960 --> 06:50.200
and we were going to
just drive outside of state

06:50.280 --> 06:52.120
so that we were safer.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.920
So, I thought, "Well, we could
drive towards Colorado

06:59.000 --> 07:01.080
and at any point turn right back around

07:01.160 --> 07:02.520
and be back in Ohio."

07:08.160 --> 07:11.800
On the trip to Colorado,
Billy was in great shape.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.400
He had no stress.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.720
I just remember we had a really good time
driving through two or three states.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.960
I left him in Aspen.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.480
I flew back and left the car with him

07:26.560 --> 07:29.000
and then he eventually
left it at the airport.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.320
Once we found out that,
okay, there's a car in Denver

07:37.400 --> 07:39.360
with his personal belongings,

07:39.440 --> 07:41.480
then the FBI got involved

07:41.560 --> 07:43.800
then that became a national issue.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.280
[siren wailing]

07:55.760 --> 07:58.320
Well, I had never heard of Billy Milligan

07:58.760 --> 08:01.560
until he became a fugitive in 1986.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.680
He would've been
considered armed and dangerous.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.640
We also found out that he had a relative

08:09.720 --> 08:12.520
in British Columbia in Canada.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.080
[Jim Morrison] The very next time
I heard my brother's voice

08:21.160 --> 08:24.600
was July 16th, 1986.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.560
He told me that he was doing well,

08:32.640 --> 08:36.040
that he had been
brought out to Colorado by Jim.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.000
He told me that he was
painting on the sidewalk.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.440
He was making good money

08:42.520 --> 08:45.680
and up to that point that day,
he'd made about $1,000

08:45.760 --> 08:47.040
and was doing okay.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.080
I asked him, "What are your plans?"

08:49.160 --> 08:51.040
He said, "I don't have any plans."

08:51.640 --> 08:53.440
He called me later that evening, the 16th,

08:53.520 --> 08:56.600
and told me that he would
be on a plane that night

08:56.680 --> 08:58.280
and he would be coming to Seattle

08:58.360 --> 09:00.320
and I would see him
the morning of the 17th.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.360
He was in good spirits. He seemed…

09:04.440 --> 09:07.160
This was the first time
I had seen him in years.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.920
I mean years, literally.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.200
We talked a little bit.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.440
I said, "I can't take you
to British Columbia."

09:12.520 --> 09:15.120
"But there's a town just
south of the border called Bellingham."

09:15.200 --> 09:17.600
"You're going to love it.
It's just like Athens."

09:19.520 --> 09:22.400
Next morning, I went down there,
we had breakfast, we talked about it.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.840
He said, "I walked around town a little.
I like it here. It's really cute."

09:25.920 --> 09:26.800
"I like it."

09:26.880 --> 09:29.360
And that was the start of him
being in Bellingham.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.560
We drove around until we found
a "For Rent" sign on a house,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.000
a little house on a hill.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.520
He went in, talked to the people inside.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.040
He came back out said,
"I've got a place. It's rented."

09:46.600 --> 09:47.440
I said, "Great."

09:50.200 --> 09:52.240
He already had a new name.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.240
"Christopher Carr." He told me about that.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.480
I gave Billy Milligan
a social security number,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.400
a card for Christopher Carr,

10:00.480 --> 10:03.760
and then he used those to apparently get

10:03.840 --> 10:06.480
either a driver's license
or some sort of state ID,

10:07.200 --> 10:08.640
and then he took it from there.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.240
So, he became Christopher Carr.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.720
And I'm not sure
if the FBI knew at that point

10:18.800 --> 10:20.680
that Chris Carr was Billy Milligan.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.200
I started seeing my brother
on an every-couple-of-day basis,

10:29.720 --> 10:31.400
at the very minimum.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.000
Weekends and things like that.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.080
He wanted to get out of Bellingham,
wanted to see some things.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.240
So, I took the chance
and brought him to Canada.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.000
I got him across the border.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.800
We didn't have to lie.
They didn't ask who he was.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.000
He stayed at my house,

10:48.080 --> 10:50.520
wanted some artwork,
wanted to do some art.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.840
So I went out and bought some art canvases

10:53.920 --> 10:55.520
and art supplies, everything,

10:55.600 --> 10:57.000
and he sat on the floor

10:57.080 --> 10:59.760
and did some of
the greatest art I've ever seen.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.560
Inside of an hour
he did an unbelievable art scene,

11:02.640 --> 11:04.080
an unbelievable piece.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.640
He wanted to go flying.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.360
So, I went out to the airplane,
took him flying.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.880
I took him flying up in the mountains
and flew him around the Expo.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.640
And then the next day
we went to Expo and he walked around,

11:15.720 --> 11:19.680
and I figured it was safe
because it was a lot of people

11:19.760 --> 11:22.080
and nobody in Canada
would know who he was.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.160
I began to think, you know,
"harboring a fugitive,"

11:27.240 --> 11:30.680
but I didn't really know
what the consequences were.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.160
We had immediately let Seattle know

11:33.240 --> 11:36.040
because of his brother being in Vancouver.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.640
So, we immediately let Seattle know
and I remember, for a fact, Seattle…

11:39.720 --> 11:42.760
We specifically asked them to, uh…

11:43.360 --> 11:45.600
at port of entries or anything else

11:45.680 --> 11:47.360
to provide the photographs

11:47.440 --> 11:49.880
in case he went
back and forth and they'd spot him.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.280
It's not like it is now.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.200
Now everything is computerized.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.760
And it's very easy
to spot somebody coming in and out.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.600
Back then it wasn't.
Thirty-five years ago, it was not.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.640
Nobody ever contacted me. Nobody.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.160
None of the police officers in Ohio.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.160
Nobody in Washington state.
Nobody ever contacted me.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.680
I was certain they knew who I was.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.080
I kept a journal of all of this.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.680
Day by day, all of my conversations,

12:23.760 --> 12:27.880
in many cases, even recorded
conversations with my brother.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.800
I was terribly nervous.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.400
As a matter of fact,
when I left him in Bellingham,

12:34.080 --> 12:36.600
I… I called Gary Schweickart.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.320
That didn't go well at all.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.280
He said, "Everybody here in Ohio's
upset with Billy right now."

12:45.200 --> 12:47.320
"He has really
messed this up for himself."

12:48.600 --> 12:52.200
And he said, "Listen,
he could just walk out in the woods

12:52.280 --> 12:56.280
and commit suicide and get it over with
and save us all a lot of problems."

12:59.520 --> 13:02.080
I hung up the phone and went,
"I can't believe this."

13:02.600 --> 13:04.600
This is a person that was his defender.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.720
I… I was beside myself.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.040
I didn't know what to do.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.800
I called Jim Murray.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.240
And from that point on,

13:11.320 --> 13:14.200
Jim Murray and I
almost had a daily correspondence

13:14.280 --> 13:17.160
either by phone, mail, whatever.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.800
At some point, his brother was worried

13:19.880 --> 13:23.120
because of these disturbing paintings
that Billy had dropped off.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.200
Also, all this stuff
that he had suddenly acquired…

13:28.880 --> 13:31.640
um, with… with no money.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.960
And he knew right away
that Billy needed help,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.680
psychological help,
that he was coming apart.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.560
I think Jim felt a sense

13:42.640 --> 13:47.920
that perhaps he could help
get Billy situated into a new life.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.200
Whereas we haven't been able
to do that here in central Ohio.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.800
But he didn't know Billy well enough
to really know how to help Billy.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.560
He didn't… he didn't know Billy.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.320
October 31st.
I'd become very… very nervous then.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.880
I called Jim Murray
and we had an hour-long discussion

14:07.960 --> 14:09.560
about Billy's condition.

14:11.920 --> 14:17.120
[Murray] Well, I think he's probably
out now handling his money situation…

14:17.200 --> 14:20.040
He gets panicky when he gets left
with a couple of thousand dollars.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.360
[Morrison] He does.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.080
[Murray] And so, if he's down
to a few hundred dollars

14:24.160 --> 14:26.160
he is desperate, in his mind.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.040
[Morrison]
He's falling apart really quick.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.760
I do have some phone calls later
where I ask Billy,

14:30.840 --> 14:32.240
I said, "Are you losing time?"

14:32.320 --> 14:35.200
And he said, "Yeah, a little."
Which means a lot, probably.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.080
Then… things started to break down.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.960
There came a time that he told me

14:48.080 --> 14:52.720
that, um, there was a guy
in his apartment complex

14:52.800 --> 14:53.760
that went missing.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.400
Because of that, he said,

14:58.480 --> 15:01.360
you know, there's a lot
of police activity around there.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.680
He needs to move.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.880
"Too many police are gonna ask questions.
I'm gonna get discovered."

15:05.960 --> 15:07.040
"They'll know who I am."

15:07.120 --> 15:10.680
And I said, "Why didn't you talk
to me about this? We could've figured…"

15:10.760 --> 15:12.600
"I can make decisions for myself."

15:12.680 --> 15:14.840
And it started getting kind of chaotic.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.880
Before he even left Bellingham,

15:16.960 --> 15:22.040
I knew that his brother was scared
of what Billy could have done.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.400
Next thing I know,
he's staying at this house.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.520
He's sharing it,
the house, with some people.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.560
And now, he's part of a company
that he and two guys started

15:35.640 --> 15:37.160
that's a hot tub company.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.360
"How you doing this with these guys?"

15:39.440 --> 15:41.800
He goes, "I'm their marketing manager."

15:42.640 --> 15:44.600
So, he knew that he needed help

15:44.680 --> 15:46.360
and his brother knew he needed help.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.840
So, I was able to do
three-way conference calls,

15:49.920 --> 15:51.840
and I could call Dr. Caul
on the other line

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
and push a button
and we all three could talk.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.600
[Caul] I care about Billy.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.040
I've been worried about him
ever since he left.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.760
Now, the best solution of all for Billy

16:01.840 --> 16:05.560
is for him to agree to turn himself in

16:06.280 --> 16:09.240
in the town where Dr. Allison is.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.280
And he recommended
a doctor named Ralph Allison

16:13.360 --> 16:16.000
who was down in California,

16:16.080 --> 16:19.240
a well-known therapist
for multiple personality.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.600
The only thing is, Billy has mostly,
throughout our relationship,

16:23.680 --> 16:27.360
tried to insist
that the treatment go along his lines

16:27.440 --> 16:28.560
and not the therapist's.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.480
[Morrison] Yeah.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.320
And my advice is that Billy,

16:32.400 --> 16:35.480
if he won't try
to get Dr. Allison to treat him

16:35.560 --> 16:38.040
with no deals, no strings,

16:38.120 --> 16:41.640
I suggest you back off
and leave him to God.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.440
I called Dr. Allison and asked
if he'd be willing to see my brother.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.760
And he said, "If he'll come
and see me, I will see him."

16:50.840 --> 16:53.200
[rock music playing]

17:01.320 --> 17:05.000
[Murray] Billy called me and said
he was north of Sacramento

17:05.640 --> 17:10.240
and wanted me
to mail him some, um, marijuana,

17:10.880 --> 17:12.720
which I had access to.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.720
[telephone rings]

17:14.560 --> 17:16.320
-[Murray] Hello? Hi.
-[Milligan] Jim?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.000
Hi, how's it going?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.440
[Murray] Not bad. How are you?

17:19.520 --> 17:20.720
[Milligan] Uh, pretty good.

17:20.800 --> 17:25.000
I just wanted to know
if you sent that to that number

17:25.080 --> 17:26.520
that you got straightened out.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.400
[Murray]
Yeah, I straightened it out, I think.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.320
-[Milligan] Okay.
-I mean, I hope I straightened it out.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.520
It was the same place we had
talked about at some point.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.560
[Milligan] Yeah.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.480
[Murray] It was a place you had
already mentioned once before, right?

17:38.560 --> 17:39.400
Okay.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.720
[Milligan] Okay, because
I checked today and it was just, you know…

17:44.400 --> 17:46.120
[Murray] Being a friend
of Billy Milligan's

17:46.200 --> 17:49.800
constantly puts you
in a stressful situation.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.240
I had promised Booker,
the highway patrol, and other people,

17:53.320 --> 17:56.200
that I would let them know
if I knew where Billy was.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.800
So, should I send him this medicine?

17:58.880 --> 18:02.080
But I decided it would be the worst thing
for him not to have medicine

18:02.160 --> 18:04.640
and to fall apart
and then somebody tries to arrest him

18:04.720 --> 18:06.200
and then violence occurs.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.080
So, my feeling was
to send him the medicine,

18:09.160 --> 18:10.360
not tell anyone

18:10.440 --> 18:13.000
and hope that he got
to see Ralph Allison a few days later.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.080
It turns out that the address
was inside of a state prison.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.120
And then he called me up that night
and he was really upset.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.880
He goes, "You set me up."

18:24.960 --> 18:26.800
"You tried to get me
to walk into a prison."

18:26.880 --> 18:29.160
I said, "I did not try
to get you to walk into a prison."

18:29.240 --> 18:31.560
"I don't know where he is.
You have his phone number."

18:31.680 --> 18:33.360
"You were supposed to call him. Did you?"

18:33.440 --> 18:34.320
"No."

18:34.400 --> 18:38.640
So, Billy had no intention
of going inside of a prison

18:39.280 --> 18:40.920
to meet Dr. Allison.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.400
I said, "Where are you at now?"

18:42.480 --> 18:44.120
He says, "Well, I'm in Florida."

18:44.200 --> 18:47.800
[Cuban-style music playing]

18:51.240 --> 18:53.120
[Morrison] He says,
"I've contacted Aunt Jo."

18:53.200 --> 18:55.120
And I said, "Are you kidding me?

18:55.200 --> 18:58.040
You're in Florida and
you're calling people that you know?

18:58.520 --> 19:00.040
Are you trying to get caught?"

19:00.120 --> 19:03.120
He says, "In many ways,
I'm already caught."

19:03.200 --> 19:06.920
"I am in a hotel conference room."

19:07.000 --> 19:10.120
"There is a law enforcement
convention going on."

19:10.200 --> 19:13.240
"All the state prosecutors
are having a convention here."

19:13.320 --> 19:16.200
And I went,
"Are you reaching out to Randy?"

19:16.320 --> 19:18.320
He says,
"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."

19:18.840 --> 19:21.040
"I'm going to go
sit down in the cafeteria

19:21.120 --> 19:23.600
and I'm going
to have the upper hand on them."

19:24.280 --> 19:26.760
And I said, "Billy, are you serious?"

19:27.480 --> 19:28.720
And he said, "Yes."

19:29.760 --> 19:31.040
[Murray] He called Randy Dana

19:31.120 --> 19:33.160
the night before
he left for the convention,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.800
and so, he put out
enough word that I felt that

19:35.880 --> 19:38.560
he's just making it easy
for them to come pick him up.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.960
I called the FBI.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.360
And I said to them,
"This is going to sound bizarre

19:44.440 --> 19:45.720
because it is bizarre."

19:46.240 --> 19:48.240
"There's a gentleman
by the name of Billy Milligan

19:48.320 --> 19:51.080
who's been on the lam since July

19:51.160 --> 19:53.080
from a mental institution in Ohio."

19:54.080 --> 19:57.080
"I've had some interaction with him
over a period of time

19:57.640 --> 20:01.200
and I know that
he's in Florida right now."

20:01.280 --> 20:02.800
[static buzzing]

20:04.200 --> 20:08.360
Well, I was sitting in the office
in mid-November of 1986

20:08.440 --> 20:11.360
and I got a phone call
from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

20:11.440 --> 20:12.720
which was unusual.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.880
I got a direct phone call.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.000
The second they called,
I knew something was up.

20:16.640 --> 20:21.200
And this one corporal said,
"We know where Billy is."

20:23.640 --> 20:26.880
Billy was currently
down in Miami with his aunt,

20:26.960 --> 20:30.160
that he had been residing
in Bellingham, Washington

20:30.240 --> 20:31.720
under a certain name.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.400
A couple hours later,
I get a phone call from FBI Miami,

20:36.400 --> 20:39.320
and they're laughing.
I said, "What happened? What's so funny?"

20:39.400 --> 20:42.360
He said,
"Well, we're sitting at his aunt's house

20:42.440 --> 20:45.640
and his aunt is being cooperative
and says, 'Yeah, he's in town.'

20:46.080 --> 20:48.160
And the phone rings and it's Billy."

20:49.200 --> 20:53.240
"And Billy says,
'Hey, I'm down at the so-and-so Hotel

20:53.320 --> 20:54.840
and I'll be home in a bit.'"

20:54.920 --> 20:57.480
I don't know
what his condition is at this point.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.120
I don't know if he's armed.
I would hope he's not,

21:00.200 --> 21:02.960
but he told me
he would never be taken back alive.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.800
He didn't want to surrender.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.920
Well, the agents
went down to the hotel, walk in,

21:09.000 --> 21:14.360
and there Mr. Milligan is sitting
with State Public Defender, Randall Dana.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.680
[guns cocking]

21:19.400 --> 21:20.520
[handcuffs clicking]

21:24.520 --> 21:29.040
As we arrested Billy,
Billy stood up and pointed at Dana

21:29.120 --> 21:31.680
and Dana said,
"It wasn't me, Billy. It wasn't me."

21:31.760 --> 21:33.600
"Don't say anything. Don't say anything."

21:38.760 --> 21:41.720
That was big news. Again, Billy Milligan,

21:41.800 --> 21:45.520
nine years after his arrest,
make headlines again.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.920
[Milligan] Anytime I'm not
at the hospital, I'm accused of crimes.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.040
I didn't…
I didn't steal anybody's jewelry.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.000
I didn't smuggle no dope,
and I didn't kill nobody,

21:59.080 --> 22:01.760
and I didn't rape nobody,
and I didn't hurt anybody.

22:02.480 --> 22:07.520
But subsequent to that,
talking to the agents in Seattle,

22:07.600 --> 22:10.720
I found out about a man missing,

22:10.800 --> 22:12.320
Michael Pierce Madden.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.360
The only other thing
that happened in that whole time

22:19.960 --> 22:24.440
was at one point in time
after Billy had left,

22:25.320 --> 22:28.120
I had a knock on my door
and it was the RCMP.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.320
That's the federal police agency
in Canada.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.600
They said, "We believe
you've had some interaction with him

22:35.680 --> 22:36.800
over the past few months."

22:36.880 --> 22:38.680
And I said, "What's the problem here?"

22:38.760 --> 22:43.360
And they said, "We believe that
your brother has done something harmful

22:43.440 --> 22:46.040
to Mike Madden and he is now missing."

22:48.160 --> 22:51.040
[Murray] Michael Madden
was reported as a missing person.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.800
This would have been in September of 1986.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.400
That was the start of him
being in Bellingham.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.480
Michael Madden was
in his early 30s when he disappeared.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.680
Michael Madden's father reported

23:13.760 --> 23:16.160
that he hadn't seen his son for some time.

23:16.240 --> 23:21.120
He made a report to the Bellingham
Police Department on September 27th.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.520
So, they went out immediately
and went to the apartment

23:27.600 --> 23:30.720
and talked to friends
and talked to people that knew him.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.000
Uh, they talked to an individual who
identified himself as Christopher Carr.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.560
They talked to neighbors.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.320
They talked to the landlord,

23:38.400 --> 23:42.640
a woman who was the landlord
of the apartment that he was staying in.

23:42.720 --> 23:47.360
And the landlady said she had last
seen Michael Madden on September 15th.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.600
She came there to collect the rent
from the two of them

23:49.680 --> 23:53.080
and she saw both of them
outside the apartment complex.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.560
And they seemed to be arguing.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.440
Every time Milligan would say something,

23:59.920 --> 24:01.840
Michael Madden would question him.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.600
He didn't believe what he was saying.

24:04.680 --> 24:09.360
And finally, Milligan got mad
and, uh, went inside his apartment.

24:14.440 --> 24:19.920
And that's the last time anybody
had ever reported seeing Michael Madden.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.480
The girl that went and cleaned
Chris Carr's apartment,

24:26.560 --> 24:30.760
found Mike Madden's checkbook,
bank statements

24:30.840 --> 24:32.200
and personal things like that.

24:32.280 --> 24:37.080
You know, his check register
under Chris Carr's bed.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.360
What did we know about Christopher Carr?
Basically nothing.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.880
He was new to the area.

24:44.960 --> 24:48.400
Uh, he was not employed that we knew of.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.240
Detective Ziebell got to interview him.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.280
I knocked on the door at 901,
where Christopher Carr was living

24:55.360 --> 24:57.680
and nobody answered the door.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.000
And then pretty soon,
I heard a noise behind me

25:00.080 --> 25:02.160
and this voice said, "Can I help you?"

25:02.240 --> 25:06.040
And it was Billy Milligan,
also known as Christopher Carr.

25:06.120 --> 25:11.240
I told him I needed to talk to him
about the disappearance of Michael Madden

25:11.320 --> 25:13.120
and he said, "I gotta go."

25:13.200 --> 25:16.640
He said, "I have to go on a business deal
and I'll be gone for three days.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.960
I'll call you when I get back."

25:19.040 --> 25:20.880
And so, he, as time went on,

25:20.960 --> 25:24.680
certainly became
the focus of the investigation,

25:25.160 --> 25:30.960
uh, and it was believed that he
may have done something to Michael Madden.

25:34.800 --> 25:39.920
Mike Madden was receiving a check
for disability from the armed services.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.480
And so these checks,
we discovered, were forged

25:44.560 --> 25:48.200
and actually put into
a joint account that Mr. Carr,

25:48.280 --> 25:53.200
Billy Milligan, had opened up
a joint account with Mr. Madden.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.160
So, he pretty well had control over him.

25:55.240 --> 26:00.280
And I think that when Michael Madden
came back from vacation

26:00.360 --> 26:03.520
on the 14th of September

26:03.600 --> 26:07.840
and then he was observed by the landlady
on the 15th of September,

26:07.920 --> 26:08.920
they were arguing.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.880
And I can just about bet
what they were arguing about.

26:11.960 --> 26:18.680
It's that Madden all of sudden realizes,
"Hey, where's my government check?"

26:19.040 --> 26:21.720
And I think that's
probably what precipitated

26:21.800 --> 26:26.360
Christopher Carr's
decision to get rid of him.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.120
If he'd just killed somebody,
why would he stay around?

26:30.200 --> 26:32.040
Unless he wanted
to wait for the next check.

26:32.680 --> 26:37.080
Christopher Carr also, on September 18th,

26:37.720 --> 26:40.800
three days
after Michael Madden was last seen,

26:41.960 --> 26:46.280
cashed Michael Madden's
September government check.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.240
I think Christopher Carr
was pretty well the boss

26:50.320 --> 26:52.040
in that relationship.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.640
And Michael Madden
was the more subdued person.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.160
This is exactly like Billy.

27:00.760 --> 27:05.560
It was Billy's MO
to hook up with someone like that.

27:05.640 --> 27:10.320
That… that he could take a leadership role

27:10.400 --> 27:13.240
and a protector role and…

27:13.320 --> 27:14.440
and use them.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.400
There was some of
the sociopathic-like behavior there

27:18.480 --> 27:23.400
where he kind of viewed people as,
"What can I get from this person?"

27:24.400 --> 27:29.720
Billy, uh, told me once
that he was a sociopath,

27:29.800 --> 27:31.280
a narcissistic sociopath.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.680
I think that's probably true.

27:32.760 --> 27:36.680
Billy was… as friendly and affable
and charismatic as he was,

27:36.760 --> 27:40.840
Billy seemed to have
no feelings for any other person.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.480
So, even though it was probably stupid

27:46.560 --> 27:49.200
for him to kill someone
and then stay there

27:49.280 --> 27:53.720
and spend the money
and drive the car and all that,

27:54.920 --> 27:58.480
that alter may not
have been thinking that way.

27:58.560 --> 28:02.760
Milligan's basically setting up
a post office box in his name,

28:03.360 --> 28:07.080
collecting and cashing Madden's
Social Security checks.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.920
Milligan's selling his car.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.440
That's a pretty good indicator
that he did away with him.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.800
Billy was falling apart.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.160
So, it's hard to know from here

28:16.240 --> 28:19.320
what was happening inside of his head

28:19.400 --> 28:20.760
and how desperate he was,

28:20.840 --> 28:24.040
because each personality
needed to do what they wanted to do

28:24.120 --> 28:25.360
and have their own life.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.360
[Morrison] We always
have to look through that prism,

28:28.480 --> 28:32.360
that context of the strong possibility

28:32.440 --> 28:33.720
that he was a multiple.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.440
I believe it.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.120
Tommy could have been driving the car.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.920
Danny could have been driving the car.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.320
Who drove the car?

28:41.920 --> 28:44.880
If he was as smart as people say he was,

28:44.960 --> 28:47.880
to pull the world's biggest hoax,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.760
he wouldn't make that stupid mistake.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.720
The man who
called himself Christopher Carr

28:54.800 --> 28:57.720
said he worked here
at Western Washington University.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.520
What he said he did here
changed all the time.

29:00.600 --> 29:04.040
Sometimes he claimed to be a professor
of Computer Sciences.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.440
Other times,
he said he was a professor of Art.

29:07.040 --> 29:11.040
People here who knew him said,
for him, lying was a way of life.

29:11.120 --> 29:16.000
I discovered that Christopher Carr
was really Billy Milligan

29:16.080 --> 29:18.080
when FBI Agent Cochran

29:18.160 --> 29:21.120
had a flyer
with Billy Milligan's face on it,

29:21.200 --> 29:23.520
showing that he was Christopher Carr

29:23.600 --> 29:26.760
and then they called me
and told me about that.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.920
[telephone ringing]

29:29.000 --> 29:31.360
[man 2 speaking indistinctly]

29:34.920 --> 29:38.440
We started checking in
to try to find out how he got his ID,

29:38.520 --> 29:40.040
where he was from.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.520
We went to Billy Milligan's cousin's place

29:42.600 --> 29:46.000
and he advised us
that Milligan and a friend

29:46.080 --> 29:48.400
had stayed there for a couple days

29:48.480 --> 29:51.040
and Milligan was not there at this time.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.480
He said Milligan
did leave his personal property

29:54.560 --> 29:56.400
in his cousin's house,

29:56.480 --> 29:59.520
a couple suitcases and some boxes.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.240
Sometimes we know
that people will keep things

30:03.320 --> 30:05.920
because they're sort of, uh…

30:06.880 --> 30:09.880
It reminds them
and they're trophies, you know.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.400
And whether that had
anything to do here, I don't know,

30:12.480 --> 30:14.760
but I've seen that in some of my cases.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.440
And sometimes that occurs with homicides.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.240
There was a fishing tackle box
that I opened up.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.040
It was full of paint supplies.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.560
Another box was looked through,
it had some gold jewelry.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.480
And in that box, we found two lenses

30:31.560 --> 30:35.760
that seemed to match
the particular frames.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.040
And there were specks
of what appeared to be blood

30:39.120 --> 30:42.520
on the lenses and also on the frame.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.640
And this was pre-DNA days. We had…

30:49.720 --> 30:53.160
DNA, really, we started using in 1989,

30:53.240 --> 30:55.760
but we did not have DNA at that point.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.280
The only thing we had
was blood on the glasses

30:58.360 --> 31:01.360
and it still would not
give us enough answers.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.120
We found no evidence where pathologists

31:04.200 --> 31:06.280
could say that
there was enough blood there

31:06.760 --> 31:08.920
that the person is dead.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.960
We had nothing to show
that anybody had passed away.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.640
Well, we had a strong belief
that Mr. Madden was killed.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.160
And we believe that Mr. Milligan
was extremely involved in it,

31:20.240 --> 31:24.560
but we really did not
have sufficient evidence

31:24.640 --> 31:27.920
nor sufficient answers to those elements
that I would have to prove,

31:28.360 --> 31:30.040
uh, to actually bring a case.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.400
They don't have a body.

31:31.920 --> 31:35.120
You can assume.
It's a good circumstantial case,

31:35.200 --> 31:36.680
but they didn't have enough.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.400
[reporter 5] Today, police are
looking into Milligan's role

31:44.480 --> 31:46.240
in the disappearance of Mike Madden.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.520
We don't have any body.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.920
We don't have any criminal

31:49.000 --> 31:51.440
or any evidence of a crime
having been committed.

31:51.520 --> 31:55.240
Again, it's a very suspicious
set of circumstances.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.160
[McEachran] I certainly could have.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.840
I could have charged him
with forgery and theft,

32:01.920 --> 32:04.560
and he'd probably
serve 30 to 60 days in jail,

32:04.640 --> 32:07.600
because that would be
the sentence for that type of a theft.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.880
And then he might end up living here

32:09.960 --> 32:12.760
which would have been
the worst of all worlds for us.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.520
Someone that can do these things

32:14.600 --> 32:18.080
and really not be held back
by any feelings of empathy

32:18.160 --> 32:20.600
or feelings that
you're doing something wrong.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.200
And which makes these people
the most dangerous people we deal with.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.520
This case is frustrating to all of us,

32:28.600 --> 32:34.000
mostly because I had to
keep talking with Michael Madden's father.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.480
And he would always ask us,

32:36.560 --> 32:38.840
"Is there anything new?
Is there anything new?"

32:39.440 --> 32:43.520
And he always felt
that Milligan had killed his son.

32:47.720 --> 32:51.360
I would love to believe
that he did not kill him.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.520
I cannot say he did not kill him.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.280
He was desperate for money.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.120
He was desperate for medication.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.840
He knew he needed treatment.
He was falling apart.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.400
It was a completely different
Billy Milligan

33:04.480 --> 33:07.240
than the one I left in Colorado.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.280
So, I think he killed Mike Madden.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.040
He may not remember it.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.360
Yes. I think he could have.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.720
I think there's
a strong possibility he could have.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.840
He had gone to a party
of 300-and-some people,

33:20.920 --> 33:23.000
someplace down on the lake.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.720
And the entire weekend,
I was not able to get a hold of him,

33:25.800 --> 33:27.200
do not know where he was at.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.120
Never ever could tell me where he was at.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.120
From what I understand from the police,

33:37.200 --> 33:40.160
that's the weekend they think
Mike Madden went missing.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.600
So, I don't know what happened.

33:42.680 --> 33:45.440
And then Jim told me that, um,

33:46.320 --> 33:48.560
Billy gave him back
all of his diving equipment

33:48.640 --> 33:50.400
and everything except a weight belt.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.200
He probably dumped the body in a lake.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.200
In the state of Washington,
as most states,

34:01.280 --> 34:04.320
unless you have a body,
you don't really have a murder.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.920
Billy Milligan may yet be
going to the state of Washington

34:08.000 --> 34:09.160
to face murder charges,

34:09.240 --> 34:11.400
but for now, at least,
he'll soon be on his way

34:11.480 --> 34:13.240
from Florida back to Columbus.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.480
Mr. Milligan.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.440
I waive.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.920
He waives.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.040
No bond.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.200
And a waiver.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.840
[reporter 6] So, he waived extradition

34:26.920 --> 34:29.880
and Milligan will be
brought back to Columbus within ten days.

34:33.640 --> 34:36.640
Billy Milligan was
arrested in November of '86,

34:36.720 --> 34:39.320
about four months after he escaped.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.720
He was brought back to Columbus, Ohio

34:41.800 --> 34:46.560
and Billy Milligan was incarcerated
at the Timothy Moritz Forensic Center.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.240
[Preston] Once Billy was
put back under the care of Dr. Lindner,

35:02.320 --> 35:04.000
he just gave up.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.080
Go back to jail and rot.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.640
That's what I figured I was doing anyway.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.680
[man 3] Are you going to eat?

35:12.760 --> 35:13.840
Probably not.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.600
I mean, what have I got to live for?

35:18.280 --> 35:20.160
What have I got to look forward to?

35:20.240 --> 35:23.600
Every time I come back in this courtroom,
the judge is going to say,

35:23.680 --> 35:26.680
"Well, you committed crimes 10 years ago,

35:26.760 --> 35:28.680
so you're dangerous to society."

35:31.120 --> 35:32.960
[Murray] So, I think
that the hunger strike

35:33.040 --> 35:36.560
was a way to get attention,
maybe media attention as well,

35:36.640 --> 35:39.880
and also to just feel in control.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.360
It was around day 34, if I recall,

35:43.440 --> 35:45.000
he ended the hunger strike.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.160
Um, so close to death, he was…

35:49.680 --> 35:51.960
I didn't think he was
going to make it through that one.

35:53.880 --> 35:58.040
The hospital brought in
another doctor, Dr. Porter.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.840
After seeing him for a period of time

36:04.920 --> 36:07.680
at the Timothy B. Moritz Forensic Center,

36:08.400 --> 36:13.560
I had his attorneys
petition the court for his release.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.640
So, there was a court hearing

36:16.400 --> 36:19.880
where his attorneys petitioned
to have him released

36:19.960 --> 36:21.200
from the Forensic Center

36:21.280 --> 36:24.520
to continue treatment
on an outpatient basis.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.680
And the judge at that time
wanted an outside evaluation,

36:28.760 --> 36:30.160
an outside expert.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.080
He was taken to Boston

36:36.160 --> 36:41.520
to be admitted into
Dr. Chu's unit in McLean Hospital.

36:41.600 --> 36:46.680
Dr. Chu wanted him on his unit for a week

36:46.760 --> 36:49.480
so that he could
observe him day in and day out.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.120
[Chu] Billy was cooperative.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.840
He was interested
in having this evaluation,

36:55.920 --> 37:02.200
but he also very strongly
wanted to give me the impression

37:02.280 --> 37:03.640
that he was stable

37:03.720 --> 37:08.960
and, in a very subtle way,
I felt slightly manipulated by him.

37:09.040 --> 37:15.120
My sense was that
since he had rather stably fused

37:15.200 --> 37:17.720
and was no longer dissociative,

37:18.520 --> 37:23.040
he was not likely
to be particularly dangerous to others.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.760
Dr. Chu concluded
that he could be released.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.320
[Milligan] I just want
to be normal and like anybody else

37:46.400 --> 37:48.120
and live a normal life,

37:48.200 --> 37:52.640
but I got a lot more to prove
than the average person now.

37:55.120 --> 37:59.480
He didn't feel that he in any way
could live a normal life here

37:59.560 --> 38:05.120
with the publicity
that had followed him for 20 years.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.680
At first, the Department of Corrections
gave him a job, actually,

38:13.760 --> 38:15.880
doing computer programming.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.880
I think that was a 90-day contract
to help him make a transition.

38:22.200 --> 38:27.240
I even clipped the article
and sent it to the Bureau in 1988

38:27.320 --> 38:29.080
where they gave him responsibility

38:29.160 --> 38:31.320
with some type
of computer systems in Ohio,

38:31.880 --> 38:34.000
which I thought was outrageous. And…

38:34.080 --> 38:38.680
So, here we have a guy
that led us on a wild goose chase,

38:38.760 --> 38:41.080
possibly killed an individual,

38:41.160 --> 38:42.960
and it's all forgotten.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.240
And there Billy is, back again.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.040
And that… that aggravated me.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.680
[Milligan] But they didn't tell me
that it was going to be like this.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.520
They didn't tell me that,
"Now that you're so famous,

38:56.600 --> 38:58.720
no one's gonna want
anything to do with you.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.400
No one's going to care about you

39:00.480 --> 39:02.680
because you were branded."

39:03.880 --> 39:06.400
In people buying into
his multiple personality story,

39:06.480 --> 39:09.120
true or not, people do forget the victims.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.200
There were at least
four young women that were raped.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.400
And Mr. Madden, who is…

39:16.280 --> 39:17.680
I believe he killed him.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.400
People, they forget about it.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
They…

39:23.400 --> 39:26.800
The… the idea that he was
a multiple personality individual

39:27.800 --> 39:28.800
trumps it all.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.120
It's over everything.

39:36.560 --> 39:41.920
March of 1990,
I received a call from Tracy,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.360
Billy Milligan's girlfriend,

39:44.440 --> 39:46.400
and she was having trouble with Milligan.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.200
He had threatened to kill her.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.520
And Tracy called me
and she was scared to death

39:53.160 --> 39:54.440
and I said, "What's going on?"

39:54.520 --> 39:56.360
She said, "Billy's threatened to kill me."

39:56.440 --> 39:58.520
"Will you come up and spend the night?"

39:58.600 --> 40:00.000
I said, "Absolutely."

40:00.080 --> 40:01.720
So, I drove to Columbus,

40:01.800 --> 40:04.360
and about two o'clock
in the morning, Billy called her.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.560
And, you know, I didn't answer the phone.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.600
I didn't say anything.
I was just listening.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.360
He said, "I know Rob's there.
Let me talk to him."

40:11.440 --> 40:15.000
"You realize that I can
come over there and kill all of you

40:15.600 --> 40:19.400
and there's nothing they can
do about it because I'm mentally ill."

40:20.960 --> 40:25.080
But the most significant thing
that Billy Milligan told Tracy was,

40:25.160 --> 40:29.320
"Those cops
were so stupid and incompetent,

40:29.400 --> 40:34.760
they didn't realize that
when I was in Florida and arrested

40:34.840 --> 40:37.840
that I had
Michael Madden's glasses with me

40:37.920 --> 40:40.320
and there were specks
of Michael Madden's blood

40:40.400 --> 40:41.600
on those glasses."

40:42.120 --> 40:47.520
And he also told Tracy that
he had killed a Black man in Logan, Ohio.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.640
And that was a particularly brutal murder.

40:59.120 --> 41:04.840
One weekend,
Dwaun Cox's mother came to my house

41:04.920 --> 41:08.360
and she started asking me
about her missing son,

41:09.040 --> 41:11.640
and she told me his name was Dwaun

41:11.720 --> 41:14.040
and he hadn't come home
a couple nights ago.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.320
And they were concerned
because that wasn't like him,

41:18.120 --> 41:21.440
and they found his car
abandoned in the Logan area.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.160
I asked Billy if he knew Dwaun
and he said, "Yeah, I knew Dwaun."

41:26.240 --> 41:28.720
And I said,
"Do you know that he's missing?"

41:28.800 --> 41:32.520
He said,
"Well, we ran around Old Man's Cave

41:32.600 --> 41:36.040
and we smoked some pot and stuff,
but I really don't know."

41:36.120 --> 41:39.440
And I don't remember
if it was before that or after that,

41:39.520 --> 41:41.480
Billy came riding up on a motorcycle.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.960
And Kathy and I looked at him
and said, "Where did you get that?"

41:47.040 --> 41:48.640
He goes, "Oh, I bought it."

41:48.720 --> 41:51.520
And he gave Kathy a large amount of money.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.080
I have no idea how much it was,

41:53.160 --> 41:55.400
but it was a substantial amount of money.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.960
When I heard about this young man
being murdered,

41:59.040 --> 42:00.080
or not…

42:00.600 --> 42:01.760
disappearing,

42:01.840 --> 42:06.040
it kind of made me wonder
if maybe that's where he got the money.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.640
And I don't think
that he's ever been found.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.680
I don't know if he…
I don't… I don't know.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.720
How much control does this person have?

42:19.800 --> 42:22.320
What's really being manifest here?

42:22.400 --> 42:24.920
Most psychiatrists,
psychologists, social workers,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
have not, uh, seen such a person.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.120
Some doctors even doubt

42:30.200 --> 42:33.120
that the illness exists
as a separate disorder.

42:33.680 --> 42:37.120
Don't call me Mr. Milligan anymore.
Didn't I tell you that once?

42:39.200 --> 42:43.840
[in French] Billy Milligan’s answer
to all the crimes he could commit

42:43.920 --> 42:45.760
is to say, "It wasn't me who did that."

42:45.840 --> 42:50.520
It makes things more confusing
to say, "It’s not me, it’s the others."

42:50.600 --> 42:53.000
[in English] He got off from going to jail

42:53.080 --> 42:56.120
with this stupid excuse
about multiple personality disorder.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.800
Nobody knows about
multiple personalities, quite frankly.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.320
People don't even agree if they exist.

43:03.080 --> 43:08.160
[in French] I believe that at that time,
psychiatrists were in such awe

43:08.240 --> 43:11.480
that we put a label on him
of 24 personalities

43:11.560 --> 43:13.240
because he was a master manipulator

43:13.320 --> 43:17.480
and, in the end, it makes us
talk more about him than the real victims.

43:18.880 --> 43:22.080
He didn't learn different ways
of dealing with people

43:22.960 --> 43:26.080
because his fundamental
underlying character

43:26.160 --> 43:31.960
was this really self-centered, impulsive,
narcissistic, acting-out individual

43:32.040 --> 43:34.440
who didn't care about other people.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.840
All of it was about Billy
and what Billy wanted.

43:36.920 --> 43:39.200
[in French]
Here, we enter into a perverse logic

43:39.280 --> 43:41.640
of someone who has no empathy.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.840
The other doesn’t exist for Milligan.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.040
Is he a danger?
Yeah, I think he was a dangerous person.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.800
But that's just the nature
of what I think he was.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.520
[Duménil, in French]
That is true psychosis.

43:54.760 --> 43:58.720
Psychopathy is this moment when a person
is capable of doing something

43:58.800 --> 44:01.200
while feeling absolutely nothing.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.560
Thus, they will act very badly.

44:03.640 --> 44:07.240
But his sense of perverse pleasure
is beyond his control

44:07.320 --> 44:08.480
and he can't stop himself.

44:08.560 --> 44:14.320
I think that Dr. Brown’s
1970 diagnosis was fair enough.

44:14.400 --> 44:18.160
We are dealing with
a fairly serious hysterical neurosis,

44:18.240 --> 44:21.520
with features
that might be called antisocial.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.360
[Milligan] It was very hard for me
because of who I was.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.120
I've always been controversy.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.160
[Murray] Who is the real Billy Milligan?

44:33.800 --> 44:36.080
Which one is the real personality?

44:36.640 --> 44:39.760
[Porter] Billy himself was probably
a very, very, very intelligent human being

44:39.840 --> 44:40.880
from the beginning.

44:40.960 --> 44:45.200
Only a certain kind of person
can become a multiple personality.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.880
He should have an Academy Award.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.080
-For what?
-For the performance he's put on.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.280
Is it a hoax? Has he been faking it?

44:55.560 --> 44:58.480
I don't think that society
has given him a chance

44:58.560 --> 45:00.240
to even begin to get well.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.920
Nobody said why these people are here.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.840
One of the things
that a multiple personality does

45:06.920 --> 45:11.800
is to conceal the fact
that there are multiple personalities.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.520
When I saw Billy Milligan,

45:14.240 --> 45:18.920
he knew nothing about Ragen,
Allen, Tommy, David and so on.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.160
[Putnam] Connie Wilbur was a pioneer.

45:21.240 --> 45:25.240
She was out there fighting
and defending this diagnosis,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.760
trying to convince people
about this diagnosis.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.480
Is that… Is that the people that…

45:31.720 --> 45:34.200
that lady told me was inside me?

45:34.280 --> 45:36.280
[Frances] How should we
account for Billy Milligan?

45:36.360 --> 45:40.400
Was he, um, someone
faking multiple personality disorder?

45:40.480 --> 45:43.680
He was good in his previous crimes
at making up excuses.

45:44.520 --> 45:50.440
He used the mental health system
and the diagnosis popular at the time

45:50.520 --> 45:53.720
and the gullibility of his therapists,

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
and I don't see anything in his life

45:55.880 --> 45:59.640
that would say that
he should be considered mentally ill,

45:59.720 --> 46:02.160
should be given
the privileges of a sick role.

46:02.240 --> 46:08.440
He's acting like a very ambivalent,
indecisive, contradictory person.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.400
[Putnam] You're dealing
with somebody who's been traumatized,

46:12.480 --> 46:16.040
who's learned to exist in a world
where people are abusive

46:16.120 --> 46:20.160
and they become manipulative
because it's a survival skill.

46:20.240 --> 46:24.480
It is a defense, of course,
against intolerable situations.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.000
Why am I that way?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.880
Multiple personality had this brief,

46:30.960 --> 46:35.120
amazing epidemic spread in America

46:35.200 --> 46:38.960
occurring around this time in the mid-70s.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.880
It becomes a kind of mass hysteria.

46:42.480 --> 46:46.880
[Putnam] So you have to be very careful
with them not to suggest things.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.200
There is a hardcore skeptic group

46:50.280 --> 46:52.200
who doesn't believe in this diagnosis,

46:52.280 --> 46:54.680
who sees it as either, um,

46:54.760 --> 46:58.480
malingering or faking, acting…

46:58.560 --> 47:00.760
And for the multiple,
that they have a good therapist

47:00.840 --> 47:02.240
that knows what they're doing

47:02.320 --> 47:04.280
and doesn't say, "This is a fakey thing,"

47:04.360 --> 47:06.920
or, "They're trying to manipulate people,"

47:07.000 --> 47:09.080
or "I don't believe in this condition."

47:09.160 --> 47:12.320
Which these kinds of attitudes and ideas
are all over the place

47:12.400 --> 47:15.000
and it's a shame
because these are brilliant people.

47:15.080 --> 47:19.480
And we're losing a lot of brains
and ability when we lose the multiples.

47:25.920 --> 47:30.480
[in French] The whole multiple
personality thing was a bit excessive.

47:30.560 --> 47:36.000
They preferred to refocus everything
on Dissociation Identity Disorder.

47:36.640 --> 47:39.120
We should realize
that multiple personality

47:39.200 --> 47:41.800
died in the mid-90s.

47:42.320 --> 47:46.000
[in English] If this was really
a deeply ingrained part of human nature,

47:46.080 --> 47:47.920
it wouldn't disappear that quickly.

47:49.560 --> 47:52.680
It's a creation of charismatic therapists

47:52.760 --> 47:55.400
and imaginative, suggestive patients

47:55.480 --> 47:57.160
to create these epidemics.

47:57.240 --> 48:01.720
[in French] We can see how the symptoms
and the diagnosis are also induced

48:01.800 --> 48:06.000
by the way in which
doctors and psychologists

48:06.080 --> 48:07.960
take care of these patients.

48:08.480 --> 48:11.440
And I think that the Billy Milligan case,

48:11.520 --> 48:13.960
like the Sibyl case or others,

48:14.680 --> 48:17.880
is like saying the moon
is made of green cheese,

48:17.960 --> 48:24.240
and believing that the state
of having multiple personalities

48:24.320 --> 48:30.080
is having real people
that haunt the body of an individual.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.920
[in English]¸People formed opinions
about him based on the assumption

48:35.000 --> 48:37.640
that he didn't have problems
and… and he does.

48:37.720 --> 48:40.440
But he became so involved
in his own story, I think,

48:40.520 --> 48:43.360
that his life became
living all those roles.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.960
Milligan's problem is that even people
who believe in rehabilitation

48:47.040 --> 48:50.400
become uneasy when someone like Billy
is released in the neighborhood.

48:50.480 --> 48:51.920
No matter what the doctors say,

48:52.000 --> 48:53.960
many here are convinced
that he's dangerous.

48:54.040 --> 48:56.040
[suspenseful music playing]

48:59.200 --> 49:00.800
[in French] We're faced with chameleons,

49:00.880 --> 49:03.520
we're faced with people who are capable

49:03.600 --> 49:05.400
of metamorphosing their state of mind

49:05.480 --> 49:09.720
depending on their needs or situation.

49:09.800 --> 49:14.040
And we can obviously see
the interest of the press and the media.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.960
This duality is really
the Hollywood style, par excellence.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.680
The Minds of Billy Milligan,
it is a fascinating book.

49:20.520 --> 49:25.600
Some people wanted to
explore Billy's case to make a movie

49:25.680 --> 49:28.200
because that's what was hot at the time.

49:28.280 --> 49:33.160
The life of Billy Milligan
contained all the elements

49:33.240 --> 49:34.920
that Hollywood craves.

49:36.880 --> 49:40.840
The story of his life
became a cause célèbre.

49:40.920 --> 49:44.040
It was…
it was what they call a "hot property."

49:44.120 --> 49:46.040
[reporter 7] According
to Entertainment Weekly,

49:46.120 --> 49:48.200
Leonardo DiCaprio
is set to play Billy Milligan

49:48.280 --> 49:51.640
in a true story film
about a man with 24 personalities.

49:52.160 --> 49:56.840
[Warne] You have the aspects
of psychology and schizophrenia.

49:56.920 --> 50:00.680
This is high drama that Hollywood adores.

50:01.160 --> 50:03.040
He was living in Heliard at the time,

50:03.520 --> 50:08.680
um, and he told me that James Cameron
was interested in making a movie

50:08.760 --> 50:12.920
and that he was talking
with people out in California.

50:13.720 --> 50:17.480
James Cameron had
interacted with Billy Milligan.

50:17.560 --> 50:21.680
Uh, he actually went with Milligan to Ohio

50:21.760 --> 50:24.480
because he wanted to see and witness

50:24.560 --> 50:29.400
where the alleged
rape and crimes were committed.

50:29.880 --> 50:32.160
[dramatic music playing]

50:36.040 --> 50:38.360
After Billy Milligan and James Cameron

50:38.440 --> 50:41.920
agreed to make the story
of his life together,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.280
Billy Milligan was
brought out to Los Angeles

50:45.360 --> 50:46.760
by the studios.

51:04.320 --> 51:06.920
When I went to California to visit Billy,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.640
he was definitely high rolling, um,

51:09.720 --> 51:12.280
you know, the LA lifestyle, I guess.

51:12.760 --> 51:16.080
All the weed
and anything you could want was available

51:16.160 --> 51:18.120
and took us out to dinner,
fancy restaurants

51:18.200 --> 51:20.480
And took us out to dinner,
fancy restaurants,

51:20.560 --> 51:22.520
and throwing money around like crazy.

51:23.960 --> 51:28.800
Billy Milligan really was
given the Hollywood treatment.

51:28.880 --> 51:32.520
He was put up in hotels
with swimming pools.

51:32.600 --> 51:36.840
There were nights out,
uh, with drugs and alcohol.

51:36.920 --> 51:40.640
Yes, there was
a lot of marijuana, a lot of cocaine.

51:41.800 --> 51:44.360
He had a condo. We'd end up back at that

51:44.440 --> 51:47.600
and try to get girls
to come back to the hot tub.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.520
And my friends and their girlfriends
and we'd all hang out.

51:52.600 --> 51:53.960
It was pretty interesting.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.280
Billy did have a taste
of the Hollywood lifestyle

52:05.360 --> 52:10.280
and, um, I'm sure
he found it fascinating and exciting.

52:11.600 --> 52:16.960
Going on some motorcycle rides
with some celebrities that he had met.

52:17.040 --> 52:20.760
He'd met Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Danny DeVito…

52:22.320 --> 52:24.320
but it's very temporal.

52:24.880 --> 52:29.120
When James Cameron
started pursuing the story,

52:29.200 --> 52:31.520
the life story of Billy Milligan,

52:31.600 --> 52:34.560
he found out
that a woman named Sandy Arcara

52:34.640 --> 52:38.800
apparently owned the rights
to Billy Milligan's life story.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.760
[woman 1] The Minds of Billy Milligan.

52:41.240 --> 52:47.920
Billy might have offered the rights
to his story to numerous people.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.960
I didn't know about it and the same
contract that I have with him,

52:51.040 --> 52:54.320
I was supposed to get
all the royalties from that book.

52:54.800 --> 52:55.800
Uh, in the contract,

52:55.880 --> 52:59.320
it stated that I would get,
I think it was 75% of the royalties

52:59.400 --> 53:00.520
from the first book

53:00.600 --> 53:02.960
and 100% of the royalties
from the second book

53:03.040 --> 53:05.280
if a second book was ever made,

53:05.360 --> 53:09.440
and royalties
from any movies that would be made.

53:10.360 --> 53:16.320
Billy Milligan may have given the rights
to his life story to countless people.

53:16.400 --> 53:20.640
You know, he did have
multiple personalities after all.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.920
At this stage, Sandy Arcara said,

53:29.000 --> 53:32.720
"Well, hang on.
He gave you the rights to this story

53:32.800 --> 53:38.120
for a lot less than should be granted."

53:38.200 --> 53:40.960
And so, she sued James Cameron

53:41.040 --> 53:45.880
to increase her salary from $250,000

53:45.960 --> 53:49.120
to 1.5 million dollars.

53:49.200 --> 53:51.640
And James Cameron took that to Fox.

53:51.720 --> 53:52.800
Fox said no.

53:52.880 --> 53:57.440
James Cameron said,
"Sandy, sorry, see you later,"

53:57.520 --> 53:59.440
and the project collapsed.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.360
[Preston] Also, at the same time,

54:08.440 --> 54:12.080
the state was hounding him
for money, for paying back.

54:13.680 --> 54:16.680
[Murray] Ohio was billing him
for every day he had ever spent

54:16.760 --> 54:20.960
in a mental health facility
or hospital or prison in Ohio.

54:22.760 --> 54:28.320
And Lavelle, which was Allan Goldsberry,
the original attorney, back in '78,

54:28.400 --> 54:32.040
um, his law firm sued him for, um…

54:33.080 --> 54:35.480
geez, it was close to $100,000.

54:36.040 --> 54:41.320
He had no money,
so he, uh, declared bankruptcy.

54:51.640 --> 54:53.560
But the William Morris Agency

54:53.640 --> 54:57.920
was starting to receive
large sums of royalties

54:58.000 --> 55:01.120
from sales of the books overseas.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.680
Couple, three million dollars
or thereabouts,

55:07.760 --> 55:13.480
and they became aware
of competing claims to that money,

55:13.560 --> 55:15.400
mostly by the state of Ohio.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.120
So, again people were envious.
They were jealous.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.920
They didn't like the idea that this guy
is getting away with something

55:21.000 --> 55:22.200
and he's also making money.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.960
They actually passed a law
called the Milligan Law

55:25.040 --> 55:26.520
because they didn't like the idea

55:26.600 --> 55:28.800
that he had made money
from selling his book.

55:36.880 --> 55:41.360
So, that bankruptcy court
ultimately took jurisdiction

55:41.440 --> 55:44.760
and would receive the book royalties

55:44.840 --> 55:48.040
and pay the state of Ohio
and pay the other creditors.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.480
[Preston]
So, he was living in LA at the time

55:54.560 --> 55:56.080
and he moved to Las Vegas.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.480
[rock music playing]

56:05.400 --> 56:10.120
[Preston] Las Vegas is a city
of gambling and drinking and partying

56:10.200 --> 56:11.800
and he could win.

56:12.400 --> 56:16.520
And I was like, "Why don't we go pay
a year's worth of your rent so you never…"

56:16.600 --> 56:19.360
"Nope, that is not what
gambling's about," he would say.

56:22.160 --> 56:25.360
When we were kids,
Billy was just always the fun uncle,

56:25.440 --> 56:27.680
so he was always really full of life.

56:27.760 --> 56:31.240
Wanted to spoil us all the time.
Wanted to give us tons of stuff.

56:31.320 --> 56:33.080
He would tell me about certain games

56:33.160 --> 56:36.640
where he won like $10,000, $20,000,

56:36.720 --> 56:39.480
playing different games
with blackjack and stuff.

56:39.560 --> 56:42.280
He was okay there for a good long while

56:42.360 --> 56:46.800
until he had episodes of mental decline.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.960
He would get very agitated
and belligerent and threaten people.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.520
He's always threatening people.

56:52.600 --> 56:55.040
I'll sue you, or I'll kill you,
or I'll have you killed.

56:55.120 --> 56:58.400
So, he was arrested a couple times
for misdemeanors

56:58.480 --> 57:01.600
or for these kinds of things.

57:05.640 --> 57:08.960
He was so totally broken
and so totally crushed

57:09.040 --> 57:12.720
that he called me and said,
"Can I come back to Ohio?"

57:25.880 --> 57:28.320
I bought a mobile home out in the field

57:28.400 --> 57:34.040
where he could quietly paint
and just live a very quiet life.

57:35.960 --> 57:39.240
He was diagnosed in 2012 with cancer.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.200
He was very scared.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.400
He was still drinking very heavily.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.720
He couldn't really care for himself.

57:46.240 --> 57:50.240
Towards the end of his life,
I was more of a caretaker

57:50.320 --> 57:55.000
and he had called me
to come visit him at the facility.

57:55.080 --> 57:57.640
So, I came, and he was asking me,

57:57.720 --> 58:00.280
"Do you think that God
could ever forgive me

58:00.360 --> 58:02.320
for the things that I've done in my life?"

58:02.400 --> 58:05.440
And so, I tell him, "Of course,
I think God can forgive you

58:05.520 --> 58:07.040
for anything that you've done."

58:07.120 --> 58:09.600
And he says,
"I've been a terrible person,"

58:09.680 --> 58:12.000
and, like,
"You don't even know what I've done."

58:12.080 --> 58:17.920
I say, "I think God can forgive
whatever it is that you've done."

58:18.480 --> 58:20.800
And then he told me,
"Well, I've killed people."

58:20.880 --> 58:22.960
"Can he even forgive me for that?"

58:38.440 --> 58:41.040
I do things and don't remember them

58:42.080 --> 58:43.320
because I'm asleep.

58:45.800 --> 58:47.640
And people tell me I do things…

58:49.880 --> 58:50.960
bad things.

58:54.760 --> 58:58.320
[man 4] How will we ever know
what is real in this case?

59:02.640 --> 59:05.040
[Murray] I've never met
anybody as extraordinary,

59:05.120 --> 59:07.160
or as smart,

59:07.240 --> 59:10.280
or as fun to be around
as Billy Milligan was.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.440
[man 4] He had some charms.
He had some creative ability.

59:14.520 --> 59:16.320
[woman 2] He was very creative.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.040
He was the most creative criminal.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.680
Certainly a sociopath.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.280
Billy Milligan was very manipulative.

59:23.920 --> 59:26.280
-[woman 3] Billy was…
-[woman 4] Interesting.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.320
[Harding] Talented…

59:27.400 --> 59:29.440
-[Morrison] Extremely intelligent…
-[man 5] Unusual.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.600
[Putnam] He was a very persuasive person.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.400
[Ziebell] He was very much in control.

59:34.480 --> 59:35.480
[man 6] Dangerous.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.120
[Preston] Fragile.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.240
[Murray] Damaged.

59:40.360 --> 59:43.800
[man 7] Is he a con man?
He seemed to be a very intelligent person.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.920
Bright con man.

59:48.560 --> 59:52.800
He was desperate…
desperately crying for help at all times

59:52.880 --> 59:55.920
and I don't think he knew
how to ask for that help.

59:56.760 --> 1:00:00.440
Who is he?
He's… he was a brilliant artist

1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:03.800
that was insane all his life.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:09.720
[Baumgardt] Billy was Billy.

1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:15.160
What about the victims? What about them?

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:18.440
[Frances] The victims
were forgotten in all this.

1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:25.200
I never, ever excuse,
even with a mental illness, that issue.

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:43.200
[Cinda Reid] I felt upset that I didn't
say something and go to the police.

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:47.320
Then Chalmer wouldn't have
got away with saying he didn't do anything

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:50.240
when I know
he had to have done something to him.

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:51.920
So…

1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:54.920
