WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:12.471
What's up, Snack Pack?
Main man SnickrSnack here,

00:12.554 --> 00:15.891
ready to Snack Attack
into this Gamaron Vault. Yeah!

00:15.974 --> 00:18.477
What are you guys up to today?
I'm going to my grandma's house later.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.605
She has a really cool dog,
and I like him. His name's Carl.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.234
-See that, Jo? This kid's the new Pootie.
-What a piece of shit.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.610
No. He's a piece of gold.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.820
SnickrSnack has a massive following,

00:28.904 --> 00:30.072
and I want it.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.115
I gotta go pee, so I'll be back.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.909
Walk with me.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.120
Jo, MMOs are the dinosaurs
of the gaming world.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.122
We can't get stuck in the past.
We gotta go mobile.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.708
-Because mobile's the future.
-No, mobile's the present.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.753
The future is a VR full-mobility
S and M sex rig,

00:44.837 --> 00:46.505
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.923
I wanna launch a mobile game.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.385
-I can assist with that.
-Unfortunately, Jo, you can't.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.804
Mobile games always have
a dash of millennial stink on them,

00:53.887 --> 00:56.890
which despite your age,
you are severely lacking.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.019
I can get you stink.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.365
Should we be holding hands?

01:14.283 --> 01:15.492
I don't know.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.579
But I do know we didn't do anything wrong.
Right?

01:18.662 --> 01:19.872
Of course not.

01:19.955 --> 01:23.208
We just gotta be careful
about how we tell people.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.377
Right, yeah. Okay…

01:25.460 --> 01:27.796
Do you think we should
make a big announcement?

01:27.880 --> 01:28.881
Or… No, okay.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.425
Maybe we should tell people individually.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.302
-And then they can spread the word.
-Right.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.721
-That way everybody feels included.
-Yeah.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.182
I just wanna make sure
we handle this delicately.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.225
Busted.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.602
Shit. Okay.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.855
-Jo. Jo! Wait.
-We had a plan to tell everyone.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.649
Look, sleeping with people in the office
is a sensitive issue.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.402
I was talking about you being late.

01:54.072 --> 01:57.075
Well, in that case,

01:57.159 --> 01:59.494
this might be a great time to tell you,
actually, that--

01:59.578 --> 02:01.330
Rachel and I are together now.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.540
So?

02:03.624 --> 02:06.502
-So we thought you should know.
-Why?

02:07.836 --> 02:11.507
Because it seems like an important thing
to let the office know?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.468
The testers fucked.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.844
-Jo!
-Jo!

02:15.928 --> 02:18.972
News flash, ladies. Whatever clambake
bubble you've been living in has burst,

02:19.056 --> 02:20.140
and no one cares.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.892
Now, let's get to work.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.493
Thanks for popping by.
Had a quick question for ya.

02:40.369 --> 02:44.706
-What's your take on mobile games?
-They suck.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.458
Yeah. They're not games.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.002
They're bullshit apps made
to distract people while they poop.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.339
I suppose you love them because you
can cram them full of microtransactions

02:52.422 --> 02:53.590
to scam middle-aged women.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.926
Hey, have some respect, tester.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.471
Jo, she's right. I do love them,
and for exactly that reason.

02:59.555 --> 03:04.518
Which is why I need a simple mobile game,
and I want you two to design it.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.604
-You want us to design our own game?
-I'm gonna give you three seconds

03:07.688 --> 03:10.148
to reconcile your ethics
with your ambition. Three, two--

03:10.232 --> 03:11.400
-We'll do it.
-Yes! We'll do it.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.818
Great! Jo, you're the producer.

03:12.901 --> 03:16.113
I need a concept
and basic gameplay design by EOW.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.241
What? No.
I don't want to work with these morons.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.826
I'm supposed to be learning from you.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.954
And you will be. Working with these morons
is all a part of your training.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.915
-Fine.
-Okay.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.793
Well, this is all very exciting, Brad,

03:29.877 --> 03:31.879
but in the interest of full disclosure,

03:31.962 --> 03:35.048
you should know that
Dana and I are together now.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.176
-So?
-That's what I said.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.929
We just thought that might
be something that concerns you.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.015
Absolutely nothing you do concerns me.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.975
Your personal affairs
have zero consequence

03:45.058 --> 03:46.768
in the operations of this studio.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.313
The fact that you think they do
is hilarious and upsetting.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.190
Yet, I'm not laughing, nor getting upset,

03:51.273 --> 03:53.775
which only further demonstrates
how little I care.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.532
Okay. That's good. I guess?

04:00.616 --> 04:02.701
-Why are you still here?
-Right. Let's go, ladies.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.244
We've got a game to make.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.788
Move, move, move. Get out!

04:08.790 --> 04:10.501
I won't let you down, boss.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.506
It's more of a feeling than anything else.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.091
I'm seeing moss-covered fortresses.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.971
Cities shimmering with silver and gold.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.559
I'm seeing castles dripping in antiquity.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.353
What does that even mean?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.230
Something can't drip in antiquity.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.315
The castle's either old or it isn't.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.943
-Like this?
-Yes! Yes!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.861
-That's exactly what I have in my head.
-How did you--

04:37.945 --> 04:40.364
God, you guys are absolutely incredible.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.158
I come up with these crazy ideas,
and you just whip 'em up.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.328
Well, producing a full high-quality render

04:46.411 --> 04:48.497
would require significantly more time.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.165
Yeah, definitely. So, let's get on it.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.377
Are you sure? No notes before we begin?

04:53.460 --> 04:56.171
No, no. It's perfect,
and if it isn't, we'll just fix it later.

04:56.255 --> 04:59.091
Right. But if you give us the notes now,

04:59.174 --> 05:02.970
we won't have to fix it later, and
we've never nailed it on our first try.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.305
Don't be so modest.
You guys got the goods.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.099
I'm going to yield the floor to Poppy.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.476
She's gonna take it away from here. Poppy.

05:11.687 --> 05:15.691
Hey, guys. So what I'm most excited
about with the new expansion

05:15.774 --> 05:21.446
is that we're now gonna have player-driven
persistent environmental changes.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.871
So, in a way,

05:29.872 --> 05:32.207
the players will now be the artists.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.627
It's kind of a strange thing
to say to the art team, isn't it?

05:37.629 --> 05:41.008
Yeah. Well, no, because
we're still gonna need art obviously.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.676
We're gonna need heaps of art.

05:43.552 --> 05:47.139
Most importantly, we're gonna need you
to design the building materials.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.017
So I'm thinking bricks.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.394
I'm thinking cement.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.480
I'm thinking… caulk.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.858
You want us to draw caulk?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.818
Yes. Caulk. Draw caulk.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.612
Draw whatever I say, guy.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.280
-What's your name again?
-His name's Phil.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.450
I can't keep track of every middle-aged
white dude this place burns through.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.826
I've worked here for ten years.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.913
-This is going great, Pop.
-Just draw what I said, okay?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.874
Draw the stuff
and the building stuff and whatever.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.542
I wanna see it by tomorrow, Phil.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.339
-Which one should we focus on?
-You better do both.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.174
It's better
to have too much than not enough.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.760
If we don't like one or the other,
we'll just scrap it later.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.555
Hey, guys, great work.
Seriously, incredible work.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.398
I can't believe we're here.

06:38.482 --> 06:43.195
Imagine how many legendary characters
Ian dreamed up in this room.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.571
I know.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.992
And I have to say, I feel pretty relieved
no one seems to care we're dating.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.453
I was thinking the same thing.
We just gotta live our truth.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.873
Well, my truth is that
you look very cute in that mo-cap suit.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.959
-This mo-cap suit?
-That mo-cap suit.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.293
-With the yellow dots?
-Yeah.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.587
-You like this one?
-Yeah.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.341
Okay. Let me show it off a little bit.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.718
Hey! We're not here
for you two to bump muffs.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.513
We're here to work.
Just pick out a character or something.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.681
Okay.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.186
What if the game's about a knight.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.272
A female knight. That could be cool,

07:18.355 --> 07:20.107
playing as an empowered female warrior.

07:20.190 --> 07:24.152
I don't know. A mobile game
should be simple, right?

07:24.236 --> 07:27.155
Like, maybe it should be about an animal?

07:27.239 --> 07:28.991
-An animal?
-Yeah.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.868
Hey, do you have any animals back there?

07:32.119 --> 07:35.581
Pig, chicken, fox, horse,
goat, kangaroo, snail--

07:35.664 --> 07:39.626
Goat. Yes. I wanna be a goat.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.381
Oh, yes. My cousins back home in Compton,

07:45.048 --> 07:48.051
they had a goat,
and that thing did some crazy-ass shit.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.179
And it walked like this.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.348
We named him RuPaul.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.393
-That's adorable, dude.
-You look like an asshole.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.647
Maybe I shouldn't be adorable.
Maybe I'm more like Jo.

08:00.731 --> 08:04.067
Oh, yeah. You're grouchy.

08:04.943 --> 08:08.697
Hi, I'm Jo, and I'm a grouchy-ass goat.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.824
Dude, grouchy goat.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.119
-That's a great title.
-That's a great title!

08:14.203 --> 08:15.913
Grouchy Goat!

08:15.996 --> 08:19.041
Grouchy Goat, Grouchy Goat,
Grouchy Goat, Grouchy Goat,

08:19.124 --> 08:21.376
Grouchy Goat, Grouchy Goat, Grouchy Goat.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.046
I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.341
David, I need a new team of programmers.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.800
-No, she doesn't.
-Yes, I do.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.261
Everyone working on the new expansion
listens to Ian and not me.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.846
Because I know how to command a room.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.890
No, it's because they're used to you
being the boss.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.558
I need a new team of people
that will look up to me

08:37.643 --> 08:39.811
as a godlike figure
that inspires awe and fear.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.481
Give her three teams, David,
it's gonna be exactly the same thing.

08:42.563 --> 08:46.235
I'm not gonna give you anything because
that's not why I called you in here.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.820
-You called us in? I don't remember that.
-No, I don't either.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.406
That's because David is
an ineffective leader who has no charisma.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.408
-Is that what you want, Poppy?
-Of course not.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.202
Okay, can I speak? Or let me speak.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.746
I shall speak!
I called you in about Friday.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.997
What's Friday?

08:59.081 --> 09:01.208
Friday. You're speaking
at the Women In Gaming luncheon.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.918
Oh, yeah. I'm not doing that.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.753
What? Yes, you are.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.089
Look, it is an opportunity

09:07.172 --> 09:10.759
to recognize and celebrate women
in gaming, which I think is an important--

09:10.843 --> 09:14.680
Please don't do that--
Issue to Montreal and to me and to my job.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.766
So you are gonna do it, woman, or Poppy.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.561
You're gonna tell women
how they're empowered,

09:20.644 --> 09:23.105
and I'm telling you to do it. So do it.

09:23.188 --> 09:27.067
Yeah, you know what, Pop?
In this instance, David is right.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.821
And it could be a good opportunity
for you to showcase your new skills.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.949
Poppy, I'm going to teach you
how to inspire a room.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.077
No, thanks. You have
your way of leading, and I have mine.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.370
Yeah, but mine actually works.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.331
The point is
what you are describing is more exciting.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.708
Mine is more technical.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.003
You can't inspire people
by describing building materials.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.754
Really?

09:50.048 --> 09:53.177
Like life, it changes.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.847
It gets harder,

09:56.930 --> 10:01.852
but it holds with the strength
that can withstand all elements.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.315
Ice, wind, fire, water.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.112
But it doesn't just hold a house together.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.700
It holds us all together.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.121
That is

10:22.789 --> 10:24.041
caulk.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.711
-Oh, come on!
-Like this?

10:28.378 --> 10:30.464
Yes! Yes! Kevin, you nailed it.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.799
God, you just always--
You can just get it perfectly.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.885
-Pop, what do you think?
-I think it's bullshit.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
Really? Why do you have goose bumps?

10:37.221 --> 10:38.847
I don't have goose--

10:38.931 --> 10:41.350
This is an involuntary reaction to--

10:41.433 --> 10:42.726
-Being inspired?
-No, no.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.604
I wasn't inspired.
I was emotionally manipulated.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.397
What's the difference?

10:47.481 --> 10:50.567
Ian, just so I'm clear,

10:50.651 --> 10:52.694
you want us to work on all this new stuff

10:52.778 --> 10:55.697
in addition to the stuff
we're already working on?

10:55.781 --> 10:57.991
Yeah, man. Work your magic. Do your thing.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.451
Again, it's not magic.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.954
It's a team of skilled artists

11:02.037 --> 11:04.748
putting in long hours on complex designs.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.376
Yeah, I don't really need to hear
how the sausage gets made.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.712
It's not sausage. I'm not a butcher.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.422
I have a master's in fine arts.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.217
Wow. He didn't ask for a podcast.
Get to work, Phil.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.718
That's what I was gonna say.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.679
-"I don't need a podcast."
-So much information.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.889
-Feel like we're on the same page, vibing.
-Kind of are.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.099
You want me to--

11:22.182 --> 11:23.934
All right. Teach me how to inspire people.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.060
Cool. Let's do it.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.062
Do I need a toothpick?

11:27.145 --> 11:29.439
No, the toothpick's my thing.
You don't really--

11:29.523 --> 11:31.733
Hey, I'm gonna go FaceTime my kids.

11:32.651 --> 11:35.279
Okay. So I'm the farmer, right?
And then I catch the goat,

11:35.362 --> 11:38.866
and then I take it back to my farm,
and then I slaughter it for its meat.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.492
It's like a metaphor about capitalism.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.202
-Yeah, it's great.
-Cool. Okay.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.872
Maybe we could start with that
and then move on from there?

11:44.955 --> 11:45.956
Sure.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.500
-That's a good starting point, right?
-Yeah, it's a starting point.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.127
-Hey.
-Hey, there you are.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.213
I've been looking all over for you.
Can I show you something?

11:53.297 --> 11:55.215
-Yeah.
-Okay. So,

11:55.299 --> 11:58.385
I stayed up all night, and I built this.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.680
What do you think?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.601
It's really good. Yeah, it's cool.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.980
-Is it a dog?
-It's a goat.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.065
It's terrible.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.151
Hey, no. I mean, you did that overnight.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.736
That's super impressive.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.070
I just see it.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.740
Does that make sense?
I know what it should be.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.534
I just don't know how to make it.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.579
Yes, totally. That's why I think we should
keep workshopping.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.999
I feel like there could be some really
socially relevant elements in this.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.709
It's a mobile game.
Shouldn't it be simple?

12:30.792 --> 12:34.463
I mean, simple in its complexity, right?

12:34.546 --> 12:35.756
I don't know what that means.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.633
Oh, my God.
Are you having your first fight?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.927
We're not fighting. We're collaborating.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.011
Yeah.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.347
There's just something missing.
That's all.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.515
There is?

12:44.598 --> 12:47.643
Well, with Ian and Poppy at this point,
there's always something missing.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.228
I feel like we should keep noodling.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.356
It's a goat that does crazy shit.
What more is there?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.399
Oh, my God! Just get to work!

12:54.483 --> 12:55.943
You get to work, you sour bitch!

12:58.779 --> 13:02.407
-That was a little harsh.
-That was too much. I'm sorry.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.536
I'm sorry. That wasn't cool.

13:06.411 --> 13:10.707
I've just sort of had enough
of your negative attitude, Jo. Okay?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.876
Because this is a big opportunity for us,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.254
and it could be for you too
if you would actually help us.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.092
I'm sorry.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.969
I just want to help produce the game.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.763
Well, stop shitting
on what we're doing and back us up.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.683
Right. You're right.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.401
Stupid idiot asshole! Fuckface! Jerk-off!

13:37.484 --> 13:42.155
Come up with a fix,
you stupid head, asshole, fuckface!

13:42.656 --> 13:44.533
You're not a producer. You're trash.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.077
You're a toilet! Just like they all said!

13:47.160 --> 13:48.745
Hey, Jo?

13:48.829 --> 13:49.830
You straight?

13:51.290 --> 13:53.250
Yes, I'm straight. You're the lesbians.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.878
I am a straight producer,
and I'm going to make the call.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.050
Rachel's right. Something is missing.

14:04.136 --> 14:05.721
And I know what it is.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.765
-What?
-Backstory.

14:09.933 --> 14:13.061
She is alone, bereft of all hope.

14:13.729 --> 14:18.108
Abandoned by the gods
to a dismal and agonizing fate.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.570
Her indomitable form roams the lands

14:21.653 --> 14:25.616
feasting, feeding, but never filling.

14:26.325 --> 14:31.455
And so is born the Grouchy Ghost!

14:32.289 --> 14:35.375
-Ghost?
-It's Grouchy Goat, C.W.

14:35.459 --> 14:39.463
It is? I heard "ghost"!

14:39.546 --> 14:40.923
That changes everything.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.300
Could the goat be dead?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.261
No.
People don't wanna play as a dead goat.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.847
I'm sorry, guys. I blew it.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.976
This was a total waste of our time.
I am useless.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.062
I'm just a fucking asshole!

14:55.145 --> 14:57.481
Okay, Jo, it's okay.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.525
You're not useless. It's just--

14:59.608 --> 15:01.610
This is all part of the creative process,
right?

15:01.693 --> 15:02.694
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

15:02.778 --> 15:06.365
Yeah. Except for this part with
the 80-year-old guy over the Internet.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.325
-That part's weird.
-Yeah, that's kinda weird.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.827
And we don't need a backstory.
The goat is grouchy.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.746
It eats tin cans
because that's what goats do.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.123
It should be a simple gameplay loop.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.416
Just a loop.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.045
Right, except that the goat should
say something. Something important.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.714
-Right.
-It can't say anything. It's a goat.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.424
-Wait, are you two fighting?
-No.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.844
Okay, great! This is great.

15:26.927 --> 15:31.056
This is just back and forth,
and back and forth.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.100
All part of the creative process.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.602
You throw out ideas,
then you throw ideas back.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.354
You catch 'em. You throw 'em back.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.357
This is great, just diving
right into the mind of the creatives.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.192
Whatever you guys need,
I'll make it happen.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.444
I'll show you. I'll show them all.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.990
Jo, I'm beginning to think
you need this more than we do.

15:48.073 --> 15:53.412
'Kay, sidebar. Look, Dana,
I know that we can make this game great.

15:53.495 --> 15:56.164
We just can't settle.
We have to keep pushing.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.295
-Do you trust me?
-I trust you.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.713
Okay.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.797
Trust.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.386
What? This is okay, right?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.470
Yeah.

16:10.554 --> 16:14.266
How I wish I could be with you
to press flesh against flesh.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.394
Could you angle the laptop
down just a tad?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.604
-Gross.
-Okay. Nope.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.440
It's better that he's remote.
I'ma hang up.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.944
Hey, Linda.
Good to see ya. You look great.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.279
Thanks.

16:28.864 --> 16:29.948
Yo.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.658
Where's Poppy?
This thing's about to start.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.244
She's feeling self-conscious
about the way she looks.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.330
-Be supportive.
-I don't wanna do this.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.207
Come on, Poppy.
You look great. Come on out.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.503
You look incredible, Poppy.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.712
I feel like an asshole.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.547
It's okay to accentuate the way you look.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.132
People follow good-looking leaders.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.718
It may be sad, but
it's just human nature. Lean into it.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.263
Yeah, I'm afraid that if I lean into
anything, you'll see my whole ass.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.559
Wait. What is that? What is she doing?

16:57.643 --> 16:59.353
She's doing jokes. Do not do jokes.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.480
Under no circumstances
should you be doing jokes.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.774
-You are not funny.
-Whatever. This is bullshit.

17:03.857 --> 17:07.027
"Women In Gaming"?
This event is one big wig.

17:07.109 --> 17:10.071
It's a fake cover that the industry
puts on to hide the ugly truth.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.281
Hey, hey. Hey,
would you take this seriously, please?

17:12.366 --> 17:15.661
Not everyone gets to be honored.
You think I'm ever gonna get an honor? No.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.621
My time's up. That's fine.
Look, it's good.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.457
We're honoring women.
It's great and everything. But it's just--

17:20.540 --> 17:22.626
Is there no room left for men?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.377
Oh, my God. David, shut up.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.005
-This is Poppy's big day, so…
-Yeah, I know.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.799
-Poppy, what are you doing?
-Crab toast.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.426
Do not eat crab toast.
They will make you gassy.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.555
-God, you eat like a child.
-No, I don't.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.185
-It's like a Halloween bag.
-This is disgusting!

17:40.269 --> 17:42.437
Look, I'm a boss. I can eat what I want.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.732
No, you can't. You need to keep
both your mind and your body sharp.

17:45.816 --> 17:48.235
You think I like
putting in the work to look like this? No.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.737
But I'm an alpha,
and that's part of being a boss.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.239
It's just the way it's always been done.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.324
Maybe I don't wanna do it
the way it's always been done.

17:54.408 --> 17:57.411
Great. We'll call up old Doc Brown,
have him pull up the DeLorean.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.246
We'll go back in time
to change human nature.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.455
Who's Doc Brown?

18:03.208 --> 18:05.502
It's a joke!
I'm joking. I'm good at jokes.

18:05.586 --> 18:07.254
That's what I'm saying.
The jokes don't play.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.547
-Poppy.
-I didn't get it.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.632
You're getting called. Time to go.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.468
Okay, now remember,
this is your moment. Act natural.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.555
But remember,
go against all of your instincts.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.224
Just read from the teleprompter, okay?
I worked all night on that copy.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.226
Yeah. Wait, you--

18:21.310 --> 18:23.437
-You wrote her speech?
-Yeah, he's good at speeches.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.647
I'm good at other stuff.
Not, like, talking stuff.

18:25.731 --> 18:29.067
But other non-, like,
word-related stuff for the job.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.862
Dear God.
Do not deviate from that teleprompter.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.740
And don't forget to smile.
We need you to be accessible.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.283
-David, shut up. She's got this.
-Yeah.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.118
-I got this.
-But definitely smile.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.287
Yes. But not like that.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.791
A little bit more.
Okay, that's good. Keep that.

18:45.626 --> 18:46.752
-Great.
-You look great.

18:46.835 --> 18:47.878
-Come on. Let's go.
-Good luck.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.005
Get out there. Work it, girl.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.423
-Yeah, woman.
-Woman.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.719
Okay, I'll lead him in
with the big picture stuff.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.387
-Do you have the updated PowerPoint?
-Yep.

18:57.471 --> 18:58.472
Great. And, C.W.,

18:58.555 --> 19:01.350
are you sure you don't want me
to take them through the new backstory?

19:01.433 --> 19:02.809
Might be a little less strange.

19:02.893 --> 19:06.647
Nonsense. I'm hungry to contribute.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.358
I shall deliver it
with complete conviction.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.402
Holy shit! Jo, this looks amazing.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.905
I had the art department whip it up.
It was easy.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.825
Actually, it wasn't easy.
And we didn't just whip it up.

19:18.909 --> 19:22.454
We worked through the night trying to make
everyone's projects and deadlines.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.916
I mean, you really stepped up
and got the job done.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.000
Thank you.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.920
Sorry. I was talking to Jo.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.758
Well, I just wanted to say--

19:34.842 --> 19:36.009
Excuse me.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.888
Like, thank you,

19:40.639 --> 19:42.558
or whatever, for,

19:43.600 --> 19:46.728
like, bringing out the best in me,
or whatever.

19:46.812 --> 19:49.189
What is happening? Are you being sincere?

19:49.273 --> 19:50.607
Yes.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.652
No, shut up.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.073
Ladies, BTW,

19:58.156 --> 20:00.075
heard you two are dating.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.743
-Very groovy.
-Awesome.

20:01.827 --> 20:02.911
Should we mute him?

20:02.995 --> 20:04.079
Shit. He's coming.

20:05.664 --> 20:06.915
I'm here.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.670
-Go.
-This is Grouchy Goat.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.049
Slaughter.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.093
Greenhouse gases.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.346
Caged life, starving for air.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.598
The farming industry--

20:22.681 --> 20:24.641
Nah. Nope. Shut it down.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.602
-What?
-Grouchy Goat is dead.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.897
-Wait. You're killing our game?
-No, no. You killed it

20:29.980 --> 20:32.858
when you overcomplicated a simple,
money-grab piece of shovel-ware.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.360
I told them to keep it simple.

20:35.444 --> 20:38.947
But they just had to ruin it
with their lefty, dick-hating agenda.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.991
What the fuck, Jo?
I thought we were on a team.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.452
We did this together.
She's totally selling us out.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.828
Is that true, Jo?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.497
Yes.

20:47.581 --> 20:49.541
You jumped ship
the second you saw it was sinking?

20:49.625 --> 20:51.418
You took the credit and not the blame?

20:51.502 --> 20:52.669
Nice work, Jo.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.255
That is a valuable lesson. Okay. See ya.

20:56.548 --> 20:57.966
Later, losers.

21:02.638 --> 21:03.680
Sorry.

21:03.764 --> 21:06.892
Rach, it's fine. It's totally cool.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.477
We'll navigate this.

21:09.019 --> 21:12.856
Right. We'll navigate it.
It's not a big deal.

21:12.940 --> 21:16.276
Indeed.
It'll take more than that to break us up.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.404
We're a threesome, aren't we?

21:19.488 --> 21:20.739
Okay.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.115
Please welcome to the stage

21:22.199 --> 21:25.619
the co-creative director
of Mythic Quest, Poppy Li.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.374
Thank you, Tracy.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.419
It is an honor to be here

21:34.503 --> 21:37.506
amongst women
who are leading our industry.

21:37.589 --> 21:42.177
But what makes a great leader?
Leadership is--

21:42.261 --> 21:45.264
Wow, that teleprompter's far away.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.225
Sorry.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.938
Just need to… Sorry.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.149
That's my candy.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.697
Okay, now I can see…

22:03.031 --> 22:05.242
…that you're all looking at me.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.663
Okay.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.292
Leadership is…

22:15.502 --> 22:16.628
Wow.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.338
This dress is tight.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.176
Sorry. I gotta…

22:24.178 --> 22:26.221
Okay, now I can relax.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.182
Oops. I tooted.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.517
Did you hear that? Maybe not.
That's the crab toasts.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.186
Damn it.

22:32.269 --> 22:34.688
Sorry, I suck at this.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.611
I'm not an alpha.

22:41.695 --> 22:46.867
I don't give people goose bumps,
and I'm not always smiling.

22:46.950 --> 22:50.370
And sometimes at work I cry for no reason

22:50.454 --> 22:53.707
other than that
I start thinking about crying.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.001
And then it starts to happen,

22:56.084 --> 22:58.754
and I can feel that
it's starting to happen now.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.465
So I'm gonna go ahead
and speed through this.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.969
I'm not tall, or a runway model.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.431
Here come the waterworks.
I don't know why.

23:09.515 --> 23:12.684
Maybe it's the estrogen. I don't know.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.603
Look.

23:14.686 --> 23:18.065
I can't promise that I'm always
gonna live up to the standard

23:18.148 --> 23:20.317
of other people's expectations.

23:20.859 --> 23:25.572
But I can promise that
I'm gonna lead with everything that I am,

23:25.656 --> 23:28.325
which means that
it might be like this sometimes.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.454
But I'm not gonna apologize,

23:32.538 --> 23:35.415
because I'm sick of apologizing.

23:35.499 --> 23:36.750
All the time.

23:37.251 --> 23:42.381
No, I'm gonna do everything that I can
to be the best boss that I can be.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.632
And you know why?

23:45.008 --> 23:48.178
'Cause I don't really--
I don't know-- Fuck everyone else.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.180
Why did you let me do this speech?

23:50.264 --> 23:52.808
I shouldn't have a platform.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.269
I don't know what women want.
I don't know what I want.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.312
I guess I wanna be a boss. It's just--

23:57.396 --> 24:00.482
I feel like I'm up here
and rambling on and farting.

24:00.566 --> 24:02.609
It's happened again, by the way.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.237
I think I might be allergic to crab.

24:07.823 --> 24:08.949
Thank you.

24:27.176 --> 24:29.928
Holy shit. She did it.

24:31.555 --> 24:34.600
I guess she can inspire.
Hey, and she didn't even need your help.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.644
What do you mean?
I wrote the speech for her. I told you.

24:37.728 --> 24:39.104
But she couldn't read the teleprompter.

24:39.188 --> 24:43.025
Oh, yeah. That was all part of it. Look.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.819
"Pretend not to be able to see.
Put on glasses.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.446
Start with 'I'm not an alpha.'"

24:47.529 --> 24:48.572
But she cried.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.449
Yeah. "I'm not a runway model.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.951
Start to cry here. Blame estrogen."

24:53.035 --> 24:55.287
-How'd you know she'd be gassy?
-The crab toast?

24:55.370 --> 24:56.872
No, I had those planted.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.374
I knew she would eat them
even though she's allergic to them

24:59.458 --> 25:00.959
'cause she's a fucking mess.

25:01.752 --> 25:02.753
-Damn.
-Yeah.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.797
She did it. I guess I owe her
the new programming team now too.

25:05.881 --> 25:06.882
Yeah.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.469
-Wait, what?
-Yeah. She called me last night.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.346
Said she was super nervous
about the speech

25:12.429 --> 25:14.681
and would not do it
unless I gave her the new team.

25:15.224 --> 25:16.225
And then she called me,

25:16.308 --> 25:19.353
and she told me she was super excited
about giving a speech,

25:19.436 --> 25:21.021
but only if I wrote it for her.

25:21.939 --> 25:23.482
She played us to get what she wanted.

25:23.565 --> 25:28.403
Oh, my God. I got goose bumps.
She inspired us.

25:29.446 --> 25:31.949
No, she didn't.
She emotionally manipulated us.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.660
What's the difference?

25:35.994 --> 25:40.499
That little mess of a human being
is a boss.
