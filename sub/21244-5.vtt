00:05.460 --> 00:09.500
Okay, guys, my SAT score's
been posted online.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.330
My entire college future depends on
what happens in the next minute.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.080

Don't check them yet.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.460
It's Kira,

00:20.460 --> 00:22.580

00:22.580 --> 00:26.500
who is about
to get her SAT scores!

00:26.500 --> 00:28.420

of 1600!

00:32.580 --> 00:35.460

your SAT score is...

00:43.500 --> 00:46.250
1060"?

00:46.250 --> 00:48.620
Is 1060 a good SAT score?

00:48.620 --> 00:50.580
1060? No way.

00:50.580 --> 00:53.670
We got
the exact same score!

00:53.670 --> 00:56.500
We're SAT twins!

00:56.500 --> 00:59.250
Aah, no!

I don't understand

01:58.250 --> 01:59.460
I've been taking
practice SAT tests

01:59.460 --> 02:01.290
since I was in,
like, third grade for fun.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.170
-[Marisa] It doesn't make any sense.
-Thank you.

02:03.170 --> 02:04.290
What kind of third grader
thinks it's fun

02:04.290 --> 02:07.290
to take
an SAT practice test?

02:07.290 --> 02:09.420
The kind that
should've gotten a 1600,

02:09.420 --> 02:11.670
not a 10... 1060.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.380
It doesn't makes sense,
you know?

02:15.380 --> 02:17.330
I mean, how could someone as smart
as me get the same score as you?

02:17.330 --> 02:18.330
No offense.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.290
Oh, none taken.

02:20.290 --> 02:23.460
You may not like your 1060,
but I'm lovin' mine.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.830
My parents are actually
talking about buying me a car.

02:26.830 --> 02:29.330
I need to stop obsessing
over this test, okay?

02:29.330 --> 02:31.250
Maybe we should talk
about something else.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.080
You know, anything else.

02:33.080 --> 02:37.670
Well, there has been a favor
I've been meaning to ask you.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.080
Yeah, for sure, just name it.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.710
Okay.
I was wondering

02:41.710 --> 02:43.790
if you would you be willing

02:43.790 --> 02:47.880
to talk to The Organization
about officially recruiting me?

02:47.880 --> 02:50.500
[laughing]

02:50.500 --> 02:51.920
You want them to recruit--

02:55.210 --> 02:57.080
Oh, Marisa, that's good.
Thank you.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.620
I really needed a good laugh.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.290
Oh, you're serious.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.080
Look, you're always telling
me to set goals for myself,

03:05.080 --> 03:07.000
and I think
I would be a good spy.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.500
I mean, let's face it.
I look amazing in wigs.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.540
Yeah, Marisa, but there's a
little bit more to it than that.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.710
So I'll learn.

03:14.710 --> 03:17.620
Okay, um... how do I put this?

03:17.620 --> 03:21.670
Uh, you're just not exactly
what they're looking for.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.460
Meaning?

03:23.460 --> 03:27.120
Meaning The Organization has,
like, a certain standard.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.380
Like?

03:28.380 --> 03:30.540
Like in the area
of cognitive thinking.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.460
-Not following.
-Book learning.

03:32.460 --> 03:33.750
Still not gettin' it.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.380
Yeah, that's
kind of the problem.

03:36.710 --> 03:40.420
Um, sometimes you tend
to just not get it.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.500
[chuckles]
Wait, I'm sorry.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.670
Are you saying that I'm not
smart enough to be a spy?

03:48.670 --> 03:51.580
Okay, um,
how do I put this nicely?

03:51.580 --> 03:53.290
Um...

03:53.290 --> 03:55.210
no, no, you're not.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.920
That's the nicely-est way
you could have put it?

03:59.920 --> 04:02.000
-It's nice-- -Okay, I may not
be good with fancy words,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.330
but don't forget, I am the
one who saved your family

04:05.330 --> 04:06.540
from the abandoned hospital.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.290
I am the one
who came up with the plan

04:08.290 --> 04:09.960
to catch that bird smuggler
in Rio.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.540
Oh, and what's
that other thing? Oh, yeah.

04:11.540 --> 04:15.000
I'm the one who has the same
exact SAT score as you.

04:17.830 --> 04:20.330
That's not the nicely-est thing
you could've said!

04:26.330 --> 04:27.830
Hi, Ernie.

04:27.830 --> 04:29.960
Zoe. What
are you doing here?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.750
I got assigned a mission

04:31.750 --> 04:34.380
to take down some smugglers
operating out of a warehouse.

04:34.380 --> 04:35.920
I get to pick a partner,

04:35.920 --> 04:38.880
and I was thinking this Friday
night maybe we could...

04:38.880 --> 04:41.120
I'd love to go
on a mission with you.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.670
-Great. It's a date.
-All right.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.540
Yeah, for sure.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.290
And hopefully those bad guys
will stay locked up forever.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.330
K.C., if I wanted
to talk to someone

05:18.330 --> 05:22.330
that doesn't listen to me,
I have a husband.

05:22.330 --> 05:25.330
I'm sorry. It's just my head's
not really in it today.

05:25.330 --> 05:26.460
Oh, well,
why don't I call Crime

05:26.460 --> 05:28.920
and tell it
to take the day off?

05:28.920 --> 05:30.750
I'm kind of freaked out
about my SAT scores.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.750
I mean, I did so good
on my practice tests.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.460
It just--
It doesn't make sense.

05:34.460 --> 05:38.080
I know a 1060 for a student
like you must be disappointing,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.750
but you've got
a lot on your plate.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.960
Wait a minute.
How did you know my score?

05:42.960 --> 05:44.670
-You just told me.
-No, I didn't.

05:44.670 --> 05:45.830
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.500
-Yes, you did.
-No, I did not.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.080
I can't even say
that score out loud.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.920
I can't even listen to my
favorite radio station anymore,

05:52.920 --> 05:55.330
1059 Plus One.

05:55.330 --> 05:58.290
K.C., I really feel for you.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.250
I know how upsetting
this must be.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.040
But don't let it
get you down, honey.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.710
Thank you, Beverly.
I appreciate that.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.790
That's, like,
the sweetest thing you've--

06:05.790 --> 06:08.460
You hacked into the system and
lowered my score, didn't you?

06:08.460 --> 06:10.290
That is absolutely not true.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.170
I had Phil from I.T. do it.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.920
Why would you guys
do this to me?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.380
K.C., less than one percent
of the population

06:19.380 --> 06:21.460
gets a perfect SAT score.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.380
It would put
a spotlight on you.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.670
I got a perfect score?

06:24.670 --> 06:27.420
Perfect score!
I knew it!

06:27.420 --> 06:28.670
And no one else will.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.710
Including the schools
that I applied to.

06:30.710 --> 06:32.500
How am I supposed to get
into the college of my choice?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.960
We invested a lot in you.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.290
Our choice is
that you don't go at all.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.380
Yeah, well, I don't really think
that's your decision to make.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.750
Tell you what,
you want a diploma,

06:40.750 --> 06:42.460
we'll get you
any diploma you want.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.330
Just name it.
Harvard? Princeton?

06:44.330 --> 06:46.120
You want to keep it real?
Howard?

06:47.620 --> 06:49.330
I can print it out
for you right now.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.290
And it's really authentic.

06:50.290 --> 06:51.880
Look.
That's how I got mine.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.330
Well, I found out
why my score was so low.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.880
Beverly had it changed.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.670
She what? That's it.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.500
I'm going down there
and straightening out her wig.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.920
No, no, Mom. Okay?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.880
I got a better idea,
okay?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.500
I'll just introduce her to
a couple of my friends...

07:10.500 --> 07:13.080
Betty and Joan.

07:13.080 --> 07:18.540
K.C., relax,
and stop naming your fists.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.500
If Beverly did it, she
probably had a good reason.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.290
Dad, why are you
defending her?

07:22.290 --> 07:23.380
You're supposed
to be on my side.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.330
Well... [mumbles]

07:25.330 --> 07:26.710
Unless you knew
about it, didn't you?

07:26.710 --> 07:27.960
Didn't you?

07:27.960 --> 07:30.330
No, of course not.
Craig, tell her.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.120
You did, didn't you?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.920
[pitch rising] No. This is the
first time I heard about it.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.290
Dad, any time you lie to me,
your voice goes up two octaves.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.880
-[high pitch] No, it doesn't.
-Yeah, you're lying.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.420
[higher pitch] I am not!

07:40.420 --> 07:42.830
Dad, come on,
how could you do this to me?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.500
Look, it was totally innocent.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.380
One minute I was having
coffee with Beverly,

07:46.380 --> 07:48.380
the next thing you know,
I was hacking into the system

07:48.380 --> 07:49.710
and changing your scores.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.420
She told me Phil
from I.T. did it.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.880
[high pitch] I know.
Right, I tried to stop him,

07:53.880 --> 07:55.330
but he told me...

07:55.330 --> 07:59.080
Okay, look,
what does it even matter?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.460
College is supposed
to prepare you for a good job,

08:01.460 --> 08:02.960
a good career.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.380
You already have
a great career.

08:04.380 --> 08:05.380
-I know.
-Okay.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.960
I mean, I don't know.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.880
Look, it's my decision
to make, okay?

08:08.880 --> 08:09.960
I don't even know
what to say to you.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.380
Look, K-- K.C.

08:13.380 --> 08:14.790
Well, I do.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.580
Craig Cooper, how dare you?

08:16.580 --> 08:19.170
You don't discuss your daughter's
future with your boss,

08:19.170 --> 08:20.290
you discuss it with your wife.

08:20.290 --> 08:23.420
[K.C.]
And your daughter!

08:23.420 --> 08:26.290
Come on. Why does K.C. even
need to go to college?

08:26.290 --> 08:28.500
She's brilliant.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.080
It's just four more years
of stuff she already knows.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.170
It's also four years
where she can have a little fun.

08:32.170 --> 08:33.540
Discover who she is.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.500
I mean, when else is
she going to live in a dorm

08:35.500 --> 08:38.080
and learn to get along with a
roommate she doesn't like?

08:38.080 --> 08:39.330
That is good experience.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.420
For what?

08:41.420 --> 08:43.380
For when she gets married!

08:50.380 --> 08:51.710
Mmm.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.460
Ah.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.420
Ernie, you--

09:01.420 --> 09:04.750
Wow. That stinks.

09:04.750 --> 09:07.330
Yet it's still better than
it usually smells in here.

09:09.290 --> 09:12.210
What you getting all fancy for?
You going on a date?

09:12.210 --> 09:14.620
Zoe asked me out
on a solo mission.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.120
Ooh. Your first solo mission
with a girl.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.380
Please. I've been on solo
missions with girls before.

09:20.380 --> 09:24.210
I meant one that
wasn't a blood relative.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.500
K.C. and Mom
are already mad at you.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.880
You really wanna
go three for three?

09:28.880 --> 09:30.670
Good point.

09:30.670 --> 09:33.880
Ernie, I'm gonna give you
a little fatherly advice, okay?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.290
You're might be
a little nervous,

09:35.290 --> 09:37.790
but just remember,
she already likes you.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.290
She picked you
for this mission,

09:39.290 --> 09:41.960
so you go in there
with a little confidence.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.880
Thanks, Dad. I really
appreciate you building me up.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.920
Ah, that's
what fathers are for.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.540
Now you get back
in the shower.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.210
The bad guys are gonna
smell you coming a mile away.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.880
Mmm.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.540
So, I have decided to be the
bigger person and forgive you.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.290
It was either that
or find a new best friend.

10:02.290 --> 10:05.960
And, frankly,
I'm just too lazy for that.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.460
Plus you missed me?

10:07.460 --> 10:08.710
You know you did.
You missed me.

10:08.710 --> 10:11.620
-You missed me.
-And I missed you.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.540
So you want to grab
a movie later?

10:13.540 --> 10:15.040
I would,
but I gotta get some rest.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.500
I gotta sneak out
in the middle of the night.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.830
What? You have no idea
how long I've waited

10:19.830 --> 10:21.460
to hear
you say those words.

10:21.460 --> 10:22.670
So what kind of trouble
you getting into?

10:22.670 --> 10:24.120
Re-taking my SATs.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.500
And you ruined it.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.710
It turns out,
I did get a perfect score.

10:28.710 --> 10:29.920
Oh, yay.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.380
But The Organization
changed it

10:31.380 --> 10:33.290
because they don't want me
going to college.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.420
So my last chance
to take it is tomorrow,

10:35.420 --> 10:36.790
but it's all the way
in upstate New York,

10:36.790 --> 10:38.290
and it's first thing
in the morning.

10:38.290 --> 10:41.000
Interesting.
You want to go to college,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.620
but The Organization
is trying to stop you.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.420
Sort of like
how I want to be a spy

10:44.420 --> 10:45.620
and you're trying
to stop me.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.210
You're just not cut out
to be a spy, okay?

10:48.210 --> 10:50.250
Well, maybe you're
not cut out to go to college.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.710
Well, what does that mean?

10:51.710 --> 10:53.620
That I think I would be
a lot better at going undercover

10:53.620 --> 10:55.380
than you would be
at getting into a sorority

10:55.380 --> 10:56.790
or having fun
at a college party.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.040
Like I would ever go
to a sorority or parties.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.500
Then what is the point
of even going to college?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.460
To learn!

11:02.460 --> 11:04.290
[laughs]

11:04.290 --> 11:06.920
To learn! That is good.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.210
And I'm the one
who's not smart.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.420
Okay, Marisa, look, I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings, okay?

11:12.420 --> 11:13.920
No, you know what?
Just stop apologizing,

11:13.920 --> 11:15.620
'cause clearly
you're not sorry.

11:15.620 --> 11:18.460
So take the test or don't.
Go to college or don't.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.500
Keep stomping on people's dreams
with your gigantic feet or don't.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.920
I really don't care anymore.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.540
Okay, I understand you're mad.

11:24.540 --> 11:27.330
Doesn't mean you have to talk
about my gigantic feet!

11:27.330 --> 11:31.250
I mean, my regular,
proportionately sized feet.

11:36.290 --> 11:39.250
Hey, why aren't you
using our bathroom?

11:39.250 --> 11:42.000
[speaking angrily,
words unclear]

11:42.000 --> 11:43.880
Oh, come on. You're not
still mad at me, are you?

11:43.880 --> 11:46.080
[speaking angrily,
words unclear]

11:46.080 --> 11:48.330
Hey, hey, hey, that kind
of language is uncalled for.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.080
Craig, you made a decision
about K.C.'s future without me.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.250
We're supposed to be a team.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.420
-Now, last I checked, there's no
"U" in team. -Don't you mean "I"?

11:59.420 --> 12:02.210
You keep correcting me, and
there'll be no you in our bedroom.

12:02.210 --> 12:05.620
Okay. I made a mistake.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.960
I'm sorry. Really.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.330
Well, I am not the only one
you owe an apology.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.920
K.C. was really upset,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.290
and she hasn't been out
of her room all night.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.120
[Craig] All right,
I'll go talk to her.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.500
No, Craig, just--
just let her cool down.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.460
Guess you're right.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.250
Like she'd ever try to kick me
out of our bedroom.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.460
Ha! Homey don't play that!

12:29.330 --> 12:30.670
Ahh.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.880
Whoa! [coughing]

12:32.880 --> 12:35.710
Oh, Ernie!
This is athlete's foot spray!

12:40.210 --> 12:41.580
At the corner, turn left.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.710
There should be a vent
that you can access.

12:43.710 --> 12:45.830
[Zoe] I don't know why you insisted
on staying behind in the van.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.080
I like staying behind.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.420
I happen to have
the perfect behind for it.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.290
I'm in.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.880
Oh, no.
I've been compromised.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.460
Ernie, I need--

13:03.460 --> 13:06.290
Zoe, are you okay?!

13:06.290 --> 13:09.330
Okay, Ernie, time to put
on your big boy pants

13:09.330 --> 13:10.960
and go save your woman.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.290
I mean, partner.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.880
Hang on, Zoe,
your partner-man is coming!

13:24.080 --> 13:25.620
-So where we going?
-Oh!

13:27.710 --> 13:30.670
Judy, what are you doing
in the car this late at night?

13:30.670 --> 13:32.960
Taking all the change
from the cup holder.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.120
Agent Craig thinks the valet parker
at The Organization is doing it.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.540
At this rate, we're only a couple of
quarters away from them throwing hands.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.120
[laughing]

13:42.120 --> 13:44.880
Now what are you doing
in the car this late at night?

13:51.290 --> 13:53.000
Okay, looks like we should
be there in plenty of time

13:53.000 --> 13:54.670
for me to sign in
and take my SAT.

13:54.670 --> 13:57.330
So thanks for not
ratting me out, Judy.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.420
You don't say squat
about those quarters,

13:59.420 --> 14:01.500
I don't say squat about this.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.080
Besides, I'm your sister.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.790
And if you can't count on me,
then who can you count on?

14:09.330 --> 14:13.330
You know, if you could feel
that, I know you'd be touched.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.040
But I can't,
so stop touching me.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.500
[cell phone rings]

14:21.500 --> 14:23.750
-[beeps]
-Hey, Beverly.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.120
[Beverly] I have
a mission for you, K.C.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.540
We need you to fly in
to Paris

14:26.540 --> 14:28.830
to extract an agent
that's been compromised.

14:28.830 --> 14:32.170
Uh, I'm a little busy
right now.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.330
Can we move it
to tomorrow?

14:34.330 --> 14:37.830
[chuckling] Okay.
Sure, no problem.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.290
Could you do me favor
and jot this number down?

14:40.290 --> 14:44.380
202-555-0155.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.330
Okay, what number is that?

14:45.330 --> 14:47.460
That's the agent's wife.

14:47.460 --> 14:51.290
You can call her and find out
where she'll want the body sent.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.000
Sarcasm noted.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.040
Look, uh, Beverly, I'm
with Marisa right now,

14:58.040 --> 15:00.420
and she has me
on this road trip

15:00.420 --> 15:02.460
to some outlet mall
in upstate New York

15:02.460 --> 15:04.580
to save a dollar
on a pair of leggings.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.120
Look, I just-- I don't think I'm
going to make it there in time.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.290
Well, see
what you can do, K.C.

15:09.290 --> 15:12.170
If you can't make it, I guess
I'll have to send in Garcia.

15:12.170 --> 15:15.170
Okay, um, I'll do my best
to get there in time.

15:23.330 --> 15:28.380
So parking the car is your way
of doing your best to get there?

15:28.380 --> 15:30.290
I don't know
what to do, okay?

15:30.290 --> 15:32.750
Maybe I should listen
to Beverly and go back,

15:32.750 --> 15:34.290
or maybe I shouldn't,

15:34.290 --> 15:35.670
because this is my last time
to take my SAT,

15:35.670 --> 15:37.330
and without the right score,

15:37.330 --> 15:39.460
I can't get into
the college of my choice.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.330
But Beverly doesn't want me to
go to college, which isn't fair,

15:41.330 --> 15:43.040
because I don't even know
what I want to do.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.960
It's just--
I mean, it's ridiculous.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.080
I knew I would have to make
a decision about my future.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.420
I just didn't think it would
have to be this very second.

15:50.420 --> 15:53.620
I don't really know
what to do.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.460
What does your gut tell you?

15:55.460 --> 15:57.710
To throw up that truck stop
veggie burger I just ate.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.670
Truckers
don't eat veggie burgers.

15:59.670 --> 16:00.880
What was I thinking?

16:00.880 --> 16:04.880
Okay, what does
your head tell you?

16:04.880 --> 16:09.380
That if I stop thinking about the veggie
burger that maybe I won't throw up.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.670
I think you need to talk this
through with someone.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.710
How about your mom?

16:14.710 --> 16:16.790
[Kira's voice]
Baby, keep driving.

16:16.790 --> 16:19.380
If anyone was meant
for college, it's you.

16:20.830 --> 16:23.290
Fine, how about your dad?

16:23.290 --> 16:25.170
[Craig's voice]
K.C., do what you gotta do.

16:25.170 --> 16:28.080
But I prefer you do
what I want you to do.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.290
Turn this car around!
College is not for you!

16:31.330 --> 16:33.040
Or your brother.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.920
[Ernie's voice] Wow,
you must really be desperate

16:35.920 --> 16:37.250
if you're
coming to me for help.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.460
Or you could
just take my advice.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.670
Don't worry about
what anyone else thinks.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.290
Just do what you think
is right for you.

16:48.330 --> 16:51.830
Thanks, Judy.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.330
-You know what?
-[engine starts]

16:53.330 --> 16:56.120
I know exactly
what direction I'm heading.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.580
[Ernie] Don't worry, Zoe.
I'm here to save you.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.710
[thud]

17:04.170 --> 17:06.170
[groans]

17:06.170 --> 17:08.670
As soon as someone saves me.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.880
Ernie, you got company.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.750
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

17:17.580 --> 17:22.500
Or should I say, "Freeze,
and please don't shoot"?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.380
Get him, Ernie.

17:23.380 --> 17:24.790
Rrrr!

17:24.790 --> 17:26.960
Rrrr!
[whimpering]

17:26.960 --> 17:28.580
[man grunts]

17:35.120 --> 17:37.380
All right, now you're
starting to tick me off.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.380
Good one, Ernie.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.380
Time for a party favor.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.080
[Zoe] Whack him!

17:51.080 --> 17:52.460
Whack him till candy
comes out of his ears!

17:58.500 --> 17:59.250
Now tie him up.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.330
Good job, Ernie.

18:08.330 --> 18:09.330
Thanks.

18:10.330 --> 18:11.670
[growling]

18:11.670 --> 18:13.210
Oh, no,
Look out, Ernie!

18:19.080 --> 18:21.380
Thanks for saving me,
Ernie.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.750
It was my pleasure.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.000
You were awesome.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.040
I was, wasn't I?

18:26.040 --> 18:28.330
I was confident.

18:28.330 --> 18:31.210
No, not was.
I am confident.

18:31.210 --> 18:35.420
In fact, I have something
I want to ask you.

18:35.420 --> 18:38.880
Zoe, would you be
my girlfriend?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.040
Really?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.960
Yes. We're good together,

18:42.960 --> 18:45.080
and I'd make a great boyfriend.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.920
I'm sweet and caring and fun.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.750
And I really like you.

18:50.750 --> 18:55.250
Oh, Ernie. I'd love
to be your girlfriend.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.080
All right.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.830
But, unfortunately, I've
been assigned to a mission

18:59.830 --> 19:01.830
in Antarctica
for the next four years.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.170
Oh.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.380
Will you wait for me?

19:11.380 --> 19:15.380
Well, I spent
the first 16 years solo.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.210
What's another four?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.330
Hey, Marisa.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.580
Okay, I deserved that,

19:35.580 --> 19:38.290
but I owe you an apology.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.500
Okay, another apology.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.920
Okay, another,
another apology.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.500
But this time,
I really mean it.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.460
Okay, I'm listening.

19:49.460 --> 19:52.330
I just want to say that

19:52.330 --> 19:53.960
I'm sorry that
I didn't take you seriously

19:53.960 --> 19:55.330
when you said
you wanted to be a spy.

19:55.330 --> 19:57.880
Ah, I knew
you'd come around.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.420
So you are going to put
in a good word for me

19:59.420 --> 20:01.250
with The Organization.
Thank you.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.830
Uh, no.
Marisa, I'm sorry.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.380
I don't think
you're understanding me.

20:05.380 --> 20:09.290
I mean, I don't feel bad
that I said no.

20:09.290 --> 20:11.880
I just feel bad
about the way that I said it.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.540
I should have never
said that you weren't smart.

20:13.540 --> 20:17.290
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, this is all wrong.

20:17.290 --> 20:19.540
I want the kind of apology
where you admit you're wrong,

20:19.540 --> 20:21.790
try to buy back my affection
with a Kleckner's gift card,

20:21.790 --> 20:23.420
and then give me what I want!

20:27.210 --> 20:29.920
Marisa, you're
not meant to be a spy, okay?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.500
If anybody was meant
for college, it's you.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.880
And not just because
you're fun at parties.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.460
College would be a great time
for you to blossom

20:37.460 --> 20:38.670
and come into your own.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.500
College is
what you think I want, K.C.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.120
What about
what I really want?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.500
I don't really think
you know what you want.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.790
And know what I want?

20:44.790 --> 20:46.920
Yes, and it's not being a spy.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.620
So in other words, you're
making the choice for me.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.790
That's really interesting,
'cause all you've been about

20:52.790 --> 20:55.210
is not having other people
make choices for you.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.620
Marisa, I'm just trying
to protect you.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.830
Well, maybe
I don't need protecting.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.960
Maybe I'm not the dumb, weak friend
that you seem to think I am.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.380
Marisa, I didn't mean to--

21:02.380 --> 21:04.880
And you don't care
about protecting me.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.500
It is all about you
and what you want.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.420
It is always about you,

21:09.420 --> 21:11.170
and I am so sick of it.
So you know what?

21:11.170 --> 21:12.750
I am making a choice.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.170
I'm backing off
this friendship.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.670
I'm taking a break
from you.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.830
Marisa,
can we just talk?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.500
[chimes]

21:35.500 --> 21:37.880
Oh, man, it's time.
It's time. It's time.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.120
Okay, this is not a drill.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.460
This is not a drill.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.420
[exhales, clears throat]

21:47.120 --> 21:50.250
"Dear K.C. Cooper,
your SAT score is..."

21:57.000 --> 21:58.580
What's up, Dad?

21:58.580 --> 22:00.670
Hey. What
you so happy about?

22:00.670 --> 22:02.290
Um, nothing.

22:02.290 --> 22:03.920
Is everything okay?

22:03.920 --> 22:06.250
Yeah. I mean, I'm not
keeping score or anything,

22:06.250 --> 22:08.500
but, uh, yeah,
everything is...

22:08.500 --> 22:10.420
perfect.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.830
[woman]
Rob, your name's on TV!
