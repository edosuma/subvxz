00:12.971 --> 00:14.889
Woman:
Oh, my God!
Shoot, I-- fuck it.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.975
(indistinct)

00:19.185 --> 00:20.979
Man:
Shoot, hold on.
Let me get...

00:21.062 --> 00:22.647

00:24.524 --> 00:25.692

00:25.775 --> 00:27.527
Man, I'm beatin'
Joker's Gang's ass.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.238
Second-round knock-out,
I promise y'all.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.824
Second round, I'm gonna knock
this fuckin' clown out tonight.

00:32.907 --> 00:33.742
Swear to God.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.786
(grunting)

00:36.870 --> 00:38.580
What's up?
Go get it in, pussy.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.582
You hurt my pocket, fuck boy.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.375
I'll make you
my bitch, nigga!

00:42.459 --> 00:43.835
I'll take your cookies, nigga!

00:43.918 --> 00:46.337
You're gonna see it
in the ring!

00:46.421 --> 00:48.173
You're gonna see!

00:48.256 --> 00:49.758
I'm gonna fuck
your nigga up.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.468
Yeah, okay. We're gonna see,
we're gonna see what's up.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.094
Throw the hands now, dawg.
Throw the hands now, dawg.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.304
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna handle him.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.264
You mad 'cause I got OnlyFans
with your bitch?

00:56.347 --> 00:58.933
Man, what's up?
What's up, man? What's up?

00:59.017 --> 01:01.186
Eleven o'clock. Ele--
Eleven o'clock.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.979
You ain't even live
in the hood, nigga.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.773
You live in
a rich area, nigga.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.441
I'm in the hood,
South Side of St. Pete, nigga.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.526
<i>727 in this bitch, nigga.</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:11.029
Real swamp shit, nigga.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.031
You a fuck boy.
You gonna get beat up.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.157
-What?
-Yes sir.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.284
Everybody,
I go by Joker Gang,

01:16.367 --> 01:19.454
Joker Ganggang, Joker 305,
rawest chico alive.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.622
Name's Gum Gang,

01:20.705 --> 01:22.290
Florida's craziest
hillbilly stuntman.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.541
<i>And I'm a content creator.</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:25.668
<i>I do backwoods</i>
<i>crazy hillbilly shit.</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:26.669
Aah!

01:26.753 --> 01:28.171
My ultimate goal
to followers

01:28.254 --> 01:29.547
is get over two million.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.508
<i>I've been shot</i>
<i>with potato launchers,</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:33.635
-(shot fired)
-(screaming)

01:33.718 --> 01:35.595
Gum Gang:
<i>Smoked out of a bass's ass.</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:37.472
<i>You gotta find you</i>
<i>a decent rod</i>

01:37.555 --> 01:39.015
<i>and shove it</i>
<i>right up its ass,</i>

01:39.098 --> 01:41.059
<i>make sure it got</i>
<i>a little airway,</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:42.602
<i>put a pipe on its asshole,</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:44.521
<i>give it mouth-to-mouth,</i>
<i>and just fire away.</i>

01:45.897 --> 01:46.981
(coughs)

01:47.065 --> 01:48.650
Oh, my goal is to have
a million followers

01:48.733 --> 01:49.526
and be verified.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.485
What he does,

01:50.568 --> 01:52.779
he shoots potato guns
at his balls,

01:52.862 --> 01:54.489
smokes out of a fuckin' fish.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.740
Know what?
I made World Star

01:55.824 --> 01:56.991
more than that nigga
made World Star.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.077
<i>He's like, what?</i>
<i>He's five times World Star.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:00.495
Only little pussies brag
about that.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.039
<i>Bro, I made World Star</i>
<i>so many times, I lost count.</i>

02:03.122 --> 02:06.459
<i>I'm so viral that</i>
<i>I should be bigger than I am.</i>

02:06.543 --> 02:07.836
<i>I could retire right now.</i>

02:07.919 --> 02:09.712
My name'll
be way bigger than his.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.297
Man, the whole story started

02:11.381 --> 02:12.757
<i>'cause my girlfriend</i>
<i>was showin' me</i>

02:12.841 --> 02:14.259
<i>Joker's Instagram page,</i>

02:14.342 --> 02:15.969
<i>and he sent her</i>
<i>some red hearts.</i>

02:16.052 --> 02:19.180
I said, "Hey, don't get
in my girlfriend's DMs no more."

02:19.264 --> 02:20.557
Joker Gang:
<i>She was a flirt with me,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:22.559
<i>She's, like, "Oh, I got</i>
<i>a boyfriend and shit,</i>

02:22.642 --> 02:24.185
<i>Gum Gang."</i>
<i>I go, "Fuck Gum Gang.</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:25.937
<i>You know, girl, I'll rock</i>
<i>your world, you know?"</i>

02:26.020 --> 02:27.689
<i>Shit, I'm handsome.</i>
<i>I'm clean.</i>

02:27.772 --> 02:29.524
<i>It was my first love</i>
<i>on Instagram.</i>

02:29.607 --> 02:31.818
When I was single, I was fuckin'
all the bitches, you know.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.737
Every cute girl
that would follow me, click,

02:34.821 --> 02:36.489
and then I send 'em
red hearts.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.032
Then he started
sendin' me red hearts

02:38.116 --> 02:39.659
<i>and wouldn't stop.</i>
<i>So I told Gum,</i>

02:39.742 --> 02:41.202
"Hey, can you
let him know, like,

02:41.286 --> 02:43.121
to, to leave me alone?"

02:43.204 --> 02:44.622
And then it was on
after that.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.457
He said, "Oh, who are you?
Ba-ba-ba."

02:46.541 --> 02:47.542
Joker Gang:
Fucking inbred motherfucker--

02:47.625 --> 02:48.710
(overlapping shouting)

02:48.793 --> 02:50.461
Some Gum Gang motherfucker,
you'll see.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.963
Announcer:
It's the much-awaited,

02:52.046 --> 02:55.008
much-anticipated
fight of the century.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.094
Joker Gang versus Gum Gang.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.805
Make some fuckin' noise
if you're ready.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.098
(bell dings)

03:02.181 --> 03:03.516
Commentator:
Here we go, Miguel.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.768
Joker Gang:
<i>I knew he wasn't</i>
<i>gonna have the cardio</i>

03:05.852 --> 03:06.895
<i>to fight three rounds.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:09.230
I already knew
what his game plan was.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.899
He was gonna throw
hellmakers.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.233
<i>He was gonna throw hellmakers</i>

03:12.317 --> 03:14.068
<i>and try to get</i>
<i>the first knockout</i>

03:14.152 --> 03:15.278
<i>he can get.</i>

03:15.361 --> 03:16.738
<i>So I was just doin'</i>
<i>my thing,</i>

03:16.821 --> 03:18.865
<i>gettin' him against the ropes,</i>
<i>lettin' him gas up.</i>

03:18.948 --> 03:21.367
<i>Then I chased</i>
<i>that nigga down and blam,</i>

03:21.451 --> 03:23.703
<i>dropped him from the first</i>
<i>30 seconds of the fight.</i>

03:23.786 --> 03:27.206
-(audience cheering)
-(bell dings)

03:27.290 --> 03:30.960
Announcer:
And the winner is Joker Gang.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.670
Gum Gang:
<i>Beginnin' of the fight,</i>
<i>I didn't realize</i>

03:32.754 --> 03:34.047
<i>how much anxiety I have.</i>

03:34.130 --> 03:37.967
<i>The liquor kicked in, and I was</i>
<i>so fuckin' off balance, man.</i>

03:38.051 --> 03:39.260
<i>It was shit outta shit match,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:41.304
<i>It was a loss.</i>
<i>Took the L and move on.</i>

03:41.387 --> 03:43.598
Hey, you don't see me
cryin' about it
like everyone else did

03:43.681 --> 03:45.725
at the fuckin'--
for the presidency.

03:45.808 --> 03:46.976
And everyone was all, like,
"Boo-hoo."

03:47.060 --> 03:47.977
Fuck it.
It is what it is.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.187
You take your L
and you move on.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.439
You know what I'm saying?
Just keep goin'.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.067
We are going to keep on winning,

03:54.150 --> 03:56.319
-winning, winning.
-Crowd: winning, winning.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.112
Crowd: (chanting)
Four more years.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.282
Four more years.
Four more years.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.578
(crowd cheering, applauding)

04:05.662 --> 04:08.039
That seems like a good way
to start the movie.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.754
It's, like, they're both
like a fight.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.382
They're both like a battle.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.430
My name's Andrew Callahan,
and I first went viral online

04:24.514 --> 04:26.349
for interviewing people
on Bourbon Street

04:26.432 --> 04:28.726
about their deepest,
darkest secrets at 2:00 a.m.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.853
and posting them on Instagram
the next morning.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.897
I lost my virginity
to my cousin.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.023
I fucked her dad.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.817
Sometimes I like
to eat booty.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.110
After I graduated,

04:37.193 --> 04:39.070
I decided to take
that show on the road.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.655
<i>So I moved into an RV,</i>

04:40.738 --> 04:42.240
<i>and I drove</i>
<i>all around the country</i>

04:42.323 --> 04:43.741
<i>goin' to different</i>
<i>conventions,</i>

04:43.825 --> 04:45.827
conspiracy rallies,
music festivals,

04:45.910 --> 04:46.786
stuff like that.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.329
White Claw!

04:48.413 --> 04:50.540
-Rawr.
-Show me your butthole!

04:50.623 --> 04:52.750
Then in 2020,
shit got super serious.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.920
Protests, pandemics.
Remember that?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.885
<i>Is the way about to go it?</i>
<i>No.</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:04.762
<i>But is everyone perfect? No.</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:11.102
Everybody cough in my face.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.521
Do it.
Somebody come cough in my face.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.982
Prolonged lockdown
basically is slavery.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.859
Freedom!

05:17.942 --> 05:20.028
Freedom! Freedom.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.654
This is the story
of the events

05:21.738 --> 05:24.032
that led up to
the January 6th Capitol riot

05:24.115 --> 05:25.283
as I saw them unfold.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.452
(crowd shouting)

05:29.120 --> 05:32.165
(pensive music playing)

05:56.981 --> 06:00.068
Reporter 1:
<i>2020 of course</i>
<i>gave us plenty to talk about.</i>

06:00.151 --> 06:02.153
Reporter 2:
<i>The year in politics</i>
<i>no one saw coming.</i>

06:02.236 --> 06:03.237
Anderson Cooper:
<i>It's been an incredible</i>

06:03.321 --> 06:05.323
<i>and unprecedented year</i>
<i>of change.</i>

06:05.406 --> 06:06.741
Reporter 3:
<i>2020 will be a year</i>

06:06.824 --> 06:08.451
<i>we'll remember</i>
<i>for the profound ways</i>

06:08.534 --> 06:10.286
<i>it has forever</i>
<i>changed our country.</i>

06:10.369 --> 06:12.538
Andrew Callaghan:
<i>Well, I think that now</i>
<i>that so much time has passed,</i>

06:12.622 --> 06:14.248
like, people forget
how crazy it felt

06:14.332 --> 06:15.416
to be in that moment
in time.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.960
Like, in that period of time
after the protests,

06:18.044 --> 06:20.630
mid-pandemic,
right before the 2020 election,

06:20.713 --> 06:22.298
it really felt like
we were heading into, like,

06:22.381 --> 06:24.759
a legitimate, I guess,
like, a second Civil War.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.136
Uh, I mean, it's funny now,
'cause that didn't happen,
right?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.180
But the news media told us
that it would happen.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.140
Big government Joe Biden
is promising

06:31.224 --> 06:33.184
a full socialist takeover.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.228
Trumpism is something akin

06:35.311 --> 06:37.897
to a fascist social
and political movement.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.607
Andrew:<i> Both sides</i>
<i>of the mainstream media</i>

06:39.690 --> 06:41.109
<i>competed for views</i>
<i>by showing us</i>

06:41.192 --> 06:42.693
<i>the worst of the worst</i>
<i>from the other side</i>

06:42.777 --> 06:44.779
<i>and creating</i>
<i>the ultimate domestic enemy</i>

06:44.862 --> 06:47.198
<i>to fear</i>
<i>and, just maybe, fight.</i>

06:47.281 --> 06:48.741
<i>And it actually worked.</i>

06:48.825 --> 06:50.618
<i>By election season,</i>
<i>Tucker Carlson was</i>

06:50.701 --> 06:52.203
<i>the most-watched show</i>
<i>on television,</i>

06:52.286 --> 06:54.622
<i>with Chris Cuomo</i>
<i>and Rachel Maddow</i>
<i>not far behind.</i>

06:54.705 --> 06:56.999
<i>So news basically</i>
<i>replaced reality TV.</i>

06:57.083 --> 06:59.669
<i>And for four months straight,</i>
<i>all main TV channels</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:03.214
<i>ran a 24-hour news cycle</i>
<i>based upon fear and predictions</i>

07:03.297 --> 07:05.007
<i>of a disaster</i>
<i>just around the corner.</i>

07:05.091 --> 07:07.510
<i>But TV news aside,</i>
<i>it really was social media</i>

07:07.593 --> 07:09.345
<i>that became</i>
<i>the ultimate war zone.</i>

07:09.428 --> 07:11.347
Vice President Mike Pence:
<i>Bias against minorities</i>

07:11.430 --> 07:12.682
<i>is a great insult...</i>

07:12.765 --> 07:14.016
(fly buzzing)

07:14.100 --> 07:16.227
<i>...to the men and women</i>
<i>who serve in law enforcement.</i>

07:16.310 --> 07:17.687
<i>If you have a problem</i>
<i>figurin' out</i>

07:17.770 --> 07:19.480
<i>whether you're for me</i>
<i>or Trump,</i>

07:19.564 --> 07:20.690
<i>then you ain't Black.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:23.818
<i>The Biden crime family's</i>
<i>stealing the election.</i>

07:23.901 --> 07:25.111
<i>The media's covering it up.</i>

07:25.194 --> 07:27.697
The Biden crime family's
stealin' this election.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.033
Joe Biden's covering up
this election. He's stealing it.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.660
Andrew:
<i>So we figured</i>
<i>we'd kick this thing off</i>

07:32.743 --> 07:35.788
<i>by finding the most radical</i>
<i>social media user we could.</i>

07:35.872 --> 07:39.208
So our research expert, Evan,
started digging around

07:39.292 --> 07:42.962
on "free speech" platforms
like Parler and BitChute,

07:43.045 --> 07:44.630
<i>full of mostly, like,</i>
<i>right-wing users</i>

07:44.714 --> 07:45.923
<i>who had been kicked</i>
<i>off Facebook</i>

07:46.007 --> 07:47.258
<i>for medical</i>
<i>misinformation policies</i>

07:47.341 --> 07:49.218
<i>talkin' about COVID,</i>
<i>stuff like that.</i>

07:49.302 --> 07:52.722
<i>And he found this guy named</i>
<i>the Inglorious Patriot.</i>

07:52.805 --> 07:55.725
Halloween is a demonic party.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.269
<i>On Halloween,</i>
<i>more baby-eating pedophiles</i>

07:58.352 --> 08:01.022
come out
than on any other day.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.733
On top of that,
today Q has stated

08:03.816 --> 08:07.028
that "The election is going to
be stolen from President Trump."

08:07.111 --> 08:10.531
The mainstream media
will never have the<i> cojones</i>

08:10.615 --> 08:13.117
to cover
this Satanic activity.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.368
And so we tracked him down.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.871
And we went to his trailer
in North Carolina.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.474
Dave Todeschini:<i> Alright,</i>
<i>my name is Dave Todeschini,</i>

08:36.557 --> 08:37.934
<i>and I started in social media</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:40.269
on my original
YouTube channel

08:40.353 --> 08:42.605
called Covfefe with Dave.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.065
Then it went
to World in Revolt,

08:44.148 --> 08:47.193
next For Truth USA!,
Inglorious Patriots,

08:47.276 --> 08:48.903
one, two, three, four,
five, six.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.155
I'm up to 11 now,
ten or 11.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.908
Basically, I have knowledge

08:53.991 --> 08:56.744
that is kinda like intuitive.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.538
Satanic ritual abuse.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.249
Psy-op. Pizzagate.
Child trafficking.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.084
Hillary Clinton.
John F. Kennedy.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.796
And then when you say,
"Wow, this fits here,"

09:06.879 --> 09:10.591
the, the pieces of the puzzle
only fit together one way.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.725
The whole government
is compromised.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.810
Every one of them.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.521
These people are not human.
They're not.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.231
They don't,
they don't do human things.

09:25.314 --> 09:29.068
I mean, alien X-Files-type shit.
I mean, really.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.612
I mean, humans do not do
these things

09:31.696 --> 09:32.780
to other human beings.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.491
They've been sacrificing
children to Molek.

09:35.574 --> 09:36.534
That is a fact.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.620
It's in
Hillary Clinton's emails.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.581
Andrew:
<i>Dave was an avid believer</i>
<i>in the conspiracy theory QAnon,</i>

09:42.665 --> 09:45.001
<i>which is that one</i>
<i>or perhaps a small group</i>

09:45.084 --> 09:46.794
<i>of high-level</i>
<i>military officials</i>

09:46.877 --> 09:49.922
<i>were sending out coded messages</i>
<i>on the image board 8chan,</i>

09:50.006 --> 09:52.717
<i>exposing a cabal</i>
<i>of Satan-worshipping pedophiles</i>

09:52.800 --> 09:54.677
<i>like Hillary Clinton</i>
<i>and Bill Gates,</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:57.596
<i>who want to turn us</i>
<i>into unarmed, vaccinated sheep,</i>

09:57.680 --> 10:00.016
<i>unlike Trump,</i>
<i>who will save the world.</i>

10:00.099 --> 10:02.351
<i>The endgame of Q's prophecies</i>
<i>was supposedly</i>

10:02.435 --> 10:04.770
<i>a mass arrest event</i>
<i>called The Storm.</i>

10:04.854 --> 10:07.023
Dave:
<i>I took an oath in 1969</i>

10:07.106 --> 10:08.649
to defend my country

10:08.733 --> 10:10.693
from all enemies foreign
and domestic.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.445
And if you don't think
that I can pick up

10:12.528 --> 10:13.863
one of those weapons
I showed you

10:13.946 --> 10:16.490
and defend my country,
you're outta your fuckin' mind.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.242
You might kill me,

10:18.326 --> 10:19.702
but I'll get a whole
goddamn bunch

10:19.785 --> 10:21.996
of you's before I do that.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.664
So what do you think's
gonna happen next?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.542
One of two things
is gonna happen.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.212
Either these people
get arrested,

10:30.296 --> 10:33.591
or you're gonna have
another Revolutionary War.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.720
Reporter:
<i>Security ramped up</i>

10:37.803 --> 10:42.767

Andrew:

10:44.644 --> 10:45.561

11:14.757 --> 11:18.094
<i>You steal their children,</i>

<i>Why are you here</i>

11:34.860 --> 11:36.821
All that stuff
is all this planned

11:36.904 --> 11:39.407
for the New World Order
and the global--

11:39.490 --> 11:40.616
globalists, you know.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.660
The, uh, globalists.

11:42.743 --> 11:43.619
-(laughs)
-Who?

11:43.702 --> 11:44.537
-What?
-Who?

11:44.620 --> 11:45.746
Uh, the globalists.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.998
Our country is occupied

11:48.082 --> 11:49.250
by globalist forces.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.543
This is pure globalist.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.670
Power-hungry globalists.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.296
You know what
a globalist is, right?

11:54.380 --> 11:55.798
-(crowd boos)
-You know what a globalist is?

11:55.881 --> 11:57.258
-Who are they?
-Who are they?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.884
Well, you know...

11:58.968 --> 12:00.219
You know who they are
as well as--

12:00.302 --> 12:01.679
I don't--
I'm not very good

12:01.762 --> 12:03.097
at details and facts,

12:03.180 --> 12:04.640
but lot of,
lot of these people

12:04.723 --> 12:06.058
<i>I think are actually</i>
<i>sellin' their souls.</i>

12:06.142 --> 12:09.145
And they hurt people,
and they hurt property.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.646
<i>And that's wrong.</i>

12:10.729 --> 12:11.772
Maybe it's your truth,

12:11.856 --> 12:13.774
but don't tell me
it's my truth.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.192
I love you.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.236
Callahan Hatfield:
How many, how many
of Trump's girlfriends

12:17.319 --> 12:20.364
do you think have had
to have abortions?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.199
I'm not gonna argue
with it. I'm...

12:22.283 --> 12:24.410
So Trump is
a vile human being

12:24.493 --> 12:26.454
void of human decency

12:26.537 --> 12:28.998
who happens
to be morbidly obese.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.167
He's not as tall
as he says he is.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.877
He has an issue
with his hair

12:32.960 --> 12:35.671
and also, um, an issue
with his penis.

12:35.754 --> 12:39.300
I think it's kinda like
a funny shape, small like that.

12:39.383 --> 12:42.303
He's Y, and he protrudes
in the front and in the back.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.848
And he always talks
about women's appearances,

12:45.931 --> 12:47.391
like that's the most
important thing.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.392
And obviously it's not.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.269
Trump's vocabulary is that

12:50.352 --> 12:52.146
of perhaps a fourth grader.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.690
Everything is good and big.
And we're all gonna win.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.986
Trump is going to go
to prison in 2022,

12:59.069 --> 13:00.779
and he's going to get raped.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.492
And again, I'm really
not that political.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.368
I just thought I'll go
to the White House

13:06.452 --> 13:07.661
to see what's going on.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.413
-(sign clatters)
-Ah! Oh, my God.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.751
<i>Why are you here if you</i>
<i>cannot take the heat? Why?</i>

13:13.834 --> 13:15.211
Andrew:
<i>And that's pretty much</i>
<i>what I saw in D.C.,</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:17.213
<i>just a hundred-person</i>
<i>screaming match.</i>

13:17.296 --> 13:19.340
<i>And, uh, some</i>
<i>of the loudest voices there</i>

13:19.423 --> 13:21.258
<i>weren't even there</i>
<i>for the election at all.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:22.384
Listen to me.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.428
It is fuckin' serious

13:24.512 --> 13:29.725
to take a baby boy
before he grows 21

13:29.808 --> 13:32.228
and deprive him
of his foreskin.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.564
Don't let them
son of a bitches cut it off.

13:35.648 --> 13:39.818
This fuckin' DOJ,
Department of Justice,

13:39.902 --> 13:44.073
and the FBI, they don't give
a fuck about your foreskin.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.201
I lived up North,
the American Siberia,

13:47.284 --> 13:52.206
and I remember how my dick
shrank down to about two inches.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.582
I pulled the foreskin back,

13:53.666 --> 13:56.210
and I saw the head
of my penis turned blue.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.754
If I didn't have a foreskin,
my for--

13:58.837 --> 13:59.922
my foreskin would have--

14:00.005 --> 14:02.132
my-my dick would have
been frost-bitten.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.592
Activist:
The coronavirus is a hoax.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.386
Our immune system
is too strong.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.763
My president bounced back
within two days.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.765
The average African American

14:09.848 --> 14:12.059
would have died
within two minutes.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.436
Trump is a super God!

14:17.314 --> 14:19.525
Shout-out to Ivanka Trump,
um, Sarah Sanders,

14:19.608 --> 14:20.568
um, Kellyanne Conway.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.152
Shout-outs to all of them, man.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.404
Like, we are blessed.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.155
We're gonna defeat
the Crips and the Bloods.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.741
We're gonna defeat M--
BLM, Black Lives Matter.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.452
We're gonna defeat Antifa.
This is not a game.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.954
(voice echoing)

14:32.997 --> 14:34.748
It is surreal down here, Terry.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.125
They've been playin'
Bruce Springsteen

14:36.208 --> 14:37.293
out here, Terry.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.545
Little bit of anxiety too
for the violence.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.463
As night fell
on that first night in D.C.,

14:41.547 --> 14:43.465
most of the kinda
peaceful crowd left.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.759
And a more
militant group arrived,

14:45.843 --> 14:47.094
a group known as Antifa,

14:47.177 --> 14:48.762
which in recent months
at that time

14:48.846 --> 14:50.723
had become
the ultimate strawman

14:50.806 --> 14:52.016
of right-wing media.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.517
Violent Antifa...

14:53.601 --> 14:54.602
The Antifa lunatics.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.728
The-- this Antifa thing.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.855
A hundred and fifty
Joe Biden voters

14:57.938 --> 14:59.773
dressed in
black paramilitary gear.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.984
For those who don't know,
Antifa is a,

15:02.067 --> 15:05.654
I would say, a loose network
of far-left protesters

15:05.738 --> 15:07.197
associated with
Black Lives Matter,

15:07.281 --> 15:08.949
but there's a little bit
of tension there.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.618
They, uh,
they wear black blocks,

15:10.701 --> 15:13.120
<i>so you can't</i>
<i>identify them, really.</i>

15:13.203 --> 15:14.663
The, the weird thing
is that, you know,

15:14.747 --> 15:15.873
right-wing
conservative media

15:15.956 --> 15:17.625
like Tucker Carlson
and Sean Hannity,

15:17.708 --> 15:20.502
they made it seem like
Antifa was,

15:20.586 --> 15:22.338
like, Joe Biden's soldiers.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.632
But most of the kids
that I talked to that night

15:24.715 --> 15:26.675
didn't even really care
about the election.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.344
Protester:
<i>I don't really give</i>
<i>a shit about elections.</i>

15:28.427 --> 15:30.262
<i>Either way, like,</i>
<i>we're not gonna have much,</i>

15:30.346 --> 15:31.513
<i>any of the change we want.</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:32.848
Abolition, bro.
We gotta burn

15:32.931 --> 15:34.266
this shit down,
but we have to build something.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.518
Like, this house is not
gonna be there anymore.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.187
It's gonna be like
a surplus center or some shit.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.897
I don't know.
I'm a fuckin' communist, man.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.899
I'm tryin' to move to Portland,
man, like, at some point.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.525
Personally, I want
to start a commune

15:43.609 --> 15:46.111
with some of my close friends
up in Colorado.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.821
Anarcho-communists.
That's basically it.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.283
If you need anything,
you get it. There is no money.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.077
When you start
to rebuild the country,

15:53.160 --> 15:54.662
what is that new country
gonna be called,

15:54.745 --> 15:55.913
and what is it
gonna look like?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.873
There's gonna be
lots of Indigenous nations

15:57.956 --> 15:59.458
that are going to be--
have resurgences.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.669
So we're gonna need
to focus on treaty building.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.212
Do mushrooms.
It fixes your brain.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.673
They might legalize
shrooms, marijuana,

16:05.756 --> 16:09.593
all types of recreational drugs
for medicinal use in D.C. soon.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.428
They've unlocked
the floodgates, baby.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.889
Reporter:
<i>The Biden lead now widening</i>

16:13.972 --> 16:15.224
<i>in the state of Nevada.</i>

16:15.307 --> 16:17.142
Lester Holt:<i> Joe Biden</i>
<i>is the apparent winner</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:19.228
<i>in the state of Wisconsin.</i>

16:19.311 --> 16:20.562
Well, it's looking for certain

16:20.646 --> 16:23.273
that Biden's going to win,
so I'm very pleased about that.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.817
Game over, racist clown.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.694
I do think that
he's better than Trump,

16:26.777 --> 16:28.195
but I also think that
in general we need

16:28.278 --> 16:31.240
to be addressing the systems
that allowed Trump to win.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.908
We need to be abolishing
these systems,

16:32.991 --> 16:34.535
like getting rid
of local police forces

16:34.618 --> 16:35.869
and investing more
into the community

16:35.953 --> 16:37.454
and more into
mental health services.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.831
I'm also a feminist,

16:38.914 --> 16:40.749
and I believe in equal rights
for all women,

16:40.833 --> 16:43.252
and that includes Black women,
especially Black trans women.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.380
I was a, a substitute teacher
in the hood, okay.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.216
And I asked God one day,
"How do I reach my students?"

16:49.299 --> 16:51.051
And he said,
"Become-- rap for them."

16:51.135 --> 16:53.137
(rapping) I find myself
breathin' in the Holy Ghost

16:53.220 --> 16:55.514
where I boast in the Lord
and his holy pleasure.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.599
I call myself
an Oreo cookie inside out.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.102
I connect more with
the African-American community.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.270
I have a love for 'em. I--

17:01.353 --> 17:02.896
I've gone to the inner city
and done work.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.315
I love the
African-American community.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.235
Black Lives Matter
as an organization

17:08.318 --> 17:11.572
has a lot of undercurrents.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.031
God bless them.
And you know what?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.491
They're fighting for a cause,
and they're getting paid.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.909
They don't have any other way
to make money.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.619
They are getting paid
$20 an hour

17:17.703 --> 17:19.955
for 12 hours
a day to protest.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.081
George Soros.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.208
98 percent of the media's
gonna lie to you,

17:23.292 --> 17:24.835
because they have
a leftist agenda

17:24.918 --> 17:26.628
to bring in socialism,
communism,

17:26.712 --> 17:27.963
and a one-world government.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.132
COVID was a plan

17:30.215 --> 17:32.092
to bring in, uh,
mail-in ballots

17:32.176 --> 17:33.886
and to steal an election
at the end of the day.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.138
Trump won in--
won in a landslide,

17:36.221 --> 17:37.556
but now somehow overnight

17:37.639 --> 17:39.850
they're finding
hundred of thousands of ballots

17:39.933 --> 17:40.768
only for Biden.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.894
The sad part is that you--

17:41.977 --> 17:44.146
we aren't even being given
the facts anymore.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.023
And so that's why
I just say,

17:46.106 --> 17:48.859
I'll say it, like,
Alex Jones knows the truth.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.780
Andrew:
<i>Alex Jones, Alex Jones.</i>

17:52.863 --> 17:54.865
<i>Pretty much</i>
<i>everybody knows him.</i>

17:54.948 --> 17:56.617
<i>He's basically</i>
<i>the most famous</i>

17:56.700 --> 17:58.118
<i>conspiracy theorist</i>
<i>of all time.</i>

17:58.202 --> 18:00.287
I don't like 'em
puttin' chemicals in the water

18:00.370 --> 18:02.581
that turn
the friggin' frogs gay!

18:02.664 --> 18:04.708
Reporter:
<i>He has the ear</i>
<i>of our current president.</i>

18:04.792 --> 18:06.418
And I think
we'll be speaking a lot.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.170
Andrew:
<i>And for years,</i>
<i>he had one of the biggest shows</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:10.005
<i>on YouTube called </i>InfoWars<i> .</i>

18:10.088 --> 18:11.340
<i>But after being de-platformed</i>

18:11.423 --> 18:13.091
<i>for calling the Sandy Hook</i>
<i>shooting a hoax...</i>

18:13.175 --> 18:14.301
They staged Sandy Hook.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.552
The evidence
is just overwhelming.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.678
Andrew:
<i>...he is now only allowed</i>

18:16.762 --> 18:17.930
<i>to post on his own website,</i>

18:18.013 --> 18:19.264
<i>where he's probably getting</i>
<i>10 percent</i>

18:19.348 --> 18:20.682
<i>of the views</i>
<i>that he used to get.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:21.934
<i>But for the first time</i>
<i>in years,</i>

18:22.017 --> 18:23.811
<i>his numbers were starting</i>
<i>to pick back up,</i>

18:23.894 --> 18:25.187
<i>because he promoted</i>
<i>conspiracy theories</i>

18:25.270 --> 18:26.688
<i>about a rigged election.</i>

18:26.772 --> 18:29.483
God bless some of the rare
media channels right now

18:29.566 --> 18:30.651
that are gonna
tell you the truth.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.945
They could embed things
in the software

18:33.028 --> 18:35.948
and even in the chips
to alter our votes.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.825
TikTok is connected to what?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.868
A thousand Chinese
porn websites.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.495
You know, when they talk
about container

18:41.578 --> 18:44.039
or, or cages,
they're actually talking

18:44.122 --> 18:45.374
about virtual containers.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.376
Joe Biden's
containing children.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.336
When you have a foreskin,

18:49.419 --> 18:52.297
it is more pleasurable
on the woman.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.717
A man without a foreskin
is like a carrot

18:55.801 --> 18:57.469
going in and out, a carrot.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.097
Remember Hercules,
he had a foreskin.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.765
Olympian power.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.653
(RV rumbling)

19:17.406 --> 19:18.407
(spits)

19:19.658 --> 19:20.701
(foam hisses)

19:20.784 --> 19:23.120
(blade scratching)

19:23.203 --> 19:25.664
John Berman:
<i>You may have gone to bed</i>
<i>thinking this election</i>

19:25.747 --> 19:28.000
<i>was headed one way,</i>
<i>and then you woke up</i>

19:28.083 --> 19:30.085
<i>and you saw things</i>
<i>were different</i>

19:30.168 --> 19:32.588
and trending increasingly
in another direction.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.215
Reporter 1:
<i>Pennsylvania's still red</i>
<i>but starting to shift as well.</i>

19:35.299 --> 19:36.550
Reporter 2:
<i>Biden has been getting</i>

19:36.633 --> 19:39.845
<i>about 70 percent</i>
<i>of the mail-in ballots.</i>

19:45.976 --> 19:48.353
Andrew:
<i>By the time I got to Philly,</i>
<i>shit was popping off.</i>

19:48.437 --> 19:49.897
<i>As more mail-in ballots</i>
<i>rolled in,</i>

19:49.980 --> 19:52.482
<i>Pennsylvania flipped from red</i>
<i>to blue overnight.</i>

19:52.566 --> 19:53.942
<i>This was</i>
<i>a huge loss for Trump.</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:55.986
<i>And within hours,</i>
<i>the Trump team actually sued</i>

19:56.069 --> 19:57.154
<i>the state of Pennsylvania</i>

19:57.237 --> 19:58.989
<i>claiming that pollsters</i>
<i>in Philly</i>

19:59.072 --> 20:00.657
<i>were rigging ballots</i>
<i>for Biden.</i>

20:00.741 --> 20:04.202
President Trump
has won... Pennsylvania.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.788
<i>We have filed</i>
<i>for federal relief.</i>

20:06.872 --> 20:08.248
Yes.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.833
What we documented in Philly

20:09.917 --> 20:12.294
was the first ever
Stop The Steal rally.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.630
-Protester: Count every vote.
-Crowd: Count every vote.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.007
Protester: (on megaphone)
<i>Jesus Christ hates</i>
<i>women presidents.</i>

20:17.090 --> 20:19.635
<i>Trump is an alpha man,</i>
<i>Joe Biden's a beta man.</i>

20:19.718 --> 20:22.471
One of them weirdos got
in my face with a megaphone

20:22.554 --> 20:23.764
and yelled that I'm a faggot.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.765
Do I look like a faggot?

20:24.848 --> 20:26.183
I'm not knockin' anybody
that's gay.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.143
That's not nice. That's what
they called me, Ron.

20:28.226 --> 20:30.145
-Listen, can I tell you
why I'm pissed off?
-Andrew: Yes.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.647
Every ounce of soda you drink,

20:31.730 --> 20:33.357
you gotta pay
a penny-and-a-half tax.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.775
You gotta pay a dollar
for the Coke

20:34.858 --> 20:36.443
so the guy can make 30 cents.

20:36.526 --> 20:39.446
-How does it make you feel?
-It's not an elected official

20:39.529 --> 20:41.323
who should tell us what to do.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.991
They gotta get them
outta here.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.451
They don't belong
on either side.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.578
Let me tell you another thing
that's pissing me off.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.622
The election

20:48.705 --> 20:51.166
is a steaming crock
of hog drippings.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.418
I can't believe that,
that America,

20:53.502 --> 20:56.797
that Americans would
really elect an idiot

20:56.880 --> 20:59.007
who has the intellect
of a bag of carrots

20:59.091 --> 21:01.301
along with his vice presidential
running mate,

21:01.385 --> 21:02.761
who's a total whore.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.346
And let's face it,
she's a whore.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.806
Kamala Harris was
a law clerk.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.015
Protester:
It's a personal attack--

21:07.099 --> 21:09.476
She was a--
Shut up, jerk-off.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.395
See, all you have
are personal attacks,

21:11.478 --> 21:14.064
and all you have
are incoherent arguments.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.149
Shut up, you--
'cause I got free speech.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.484
It is legal to beat up

21:17.567 --> 21:20.153
and maybe even kill people
who wear MAGA hats.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.073
The cops will not do anything
to protect you.

21:23.156 --> 21:26.243
And now I can say

21:26.326 --> 21:28.787
I sort of kind of know

21:28.870 --> 21:30.956
what it must have been like

21:31.039 --> 21:35.794
to be a Jew in Germany
on January 30th of 1933.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.046
This is a Civil War,
the second Civil War.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.340
No evidence. There's no evidence
there's voter fraud.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.634
I don't know where they're
getting, getting their,
their facts from.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.886
My vote is in that,
in that, uh,

21:44.970 --> 21:46.388
convention center,
and I want it counted.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.389
Hopefully they hurry up

21:47.472 --> 21:49.516
with legalizing weed
in New Jersey.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.184
These are good things
that we're fighting for.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.395
The Democratic Party
has gone communist.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.688
They've gone insane.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.690
And, and I will fight
to my death

21:56.773 --> 21:59.693
fighting the evil
of progressive liberalism.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.987
I'm feelin' a little militant,
I ain't gonna lie.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.573
If it gets darker
and the lights shut off,

22:04.656 --> 22:06.283
we're gonna probably
get bloody here.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.369
I mean, I-- in a way,
I don't want my parents to weep.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.163
But I'm for establishing

22:11.246 --> 22:13.790
a strong nationalist
Christian-based nation.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.542
Christo-Fash,
that's what we wanna do.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.252
-Christian fascist?
-Yeah.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.588
I, I promise you,
before inauguration,

22:19.671 --> 22:21.048
we're gonna have
a few bodies.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.883
I wanna see Trump supporters
turn into Antifa.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.426
It's gonna be hilarious,
you know.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.802
They're gonna,
they're gonna wind up attacking

22:25.886 --> 22:27.763
the other side finally,
grow a pair.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.307
'Cause whites in America
are basically giving up

22:30.390 --> 22:31.933
their, their, their beliefs

22:32.017 --> 22:33.435
to make others
feel comfortable.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.813
And I see it as put
the whites first, you know.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.399
Do you ever feel like
you've gone too far down
the rabbit hole, man?

22:39.900 --> 22:40.859
Oh, um,

22:40.942 --> 22:43.528
what-whatever I'm trying
to dig deep into

22:43.612 --> 22:44.738
is gonna put me in a grave.

22:44.821 --> 22:45.739
I know that.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.324
And then the more,
the more you dig,

22:47.407 --> 22:49.743
the closer you are
to your own grave.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.120
(eerie music playing)

22:54.664 --> 22:57.334
Uncle Jeff: (over phone)
<i>Hey, Andrew.</i>
<i>It's your uncle, Jeff.</i>

22:57.417 --> 22:59.127
<i>Listen, I know,</i>
<i>uh, you're in town.</i>

22:59.211 --> 23:00.629
<i>I was hoping</i>
<i>you can do me a favor.</i>

23:00.712 --> 23:02.005
<i>I wanted to see</i>
<i>if you would be able</i>

23:02.089 --> 23:04.091
<i>to watch Roman</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

23:04.174 --> 23:06.843
<i>Just don't take him out</i>
<i>and get him involved</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:08.303
<i>in any weird shit</i>
<i>that you guys are doin'.</i>

23:08.386 --> 23:10.347
<i>Let me know if you can do it.</i>
<i>See ya.</i>

23:10.430 --> 23:11.765
Andrew:
<i>In the midst of what felt like</i>

23:11.848 --> 23:13.433
<i>the calm before</i>
<i>a massive shit storm,</i>

23:13.517 --> 23:15.143
<i>I was put in charge</i>
<i>of a real-life kid</i>

23:15.227 --> 23:16.686
<i>for 24 hours.</i>

23:19.731 --> 23:21.358
My dude, what's up, bro?

23:22.859 --> 23:24.111
You wanna check it out?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.120
(toy RV beeps)

23:35.247 --> 23:36.873
Dah, dah, dah-duh, da-da.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.625
Here we are.
(laughs)

23:38.708 --> 23:43.088
Both: Naahhh!

23:43.171 --> 23:45.006
Andrew:
How's 2020 been for you so far?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.562
Andrew:
What is the coronavirus?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.042
Andrew:
<i>Okay, fill us in.</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:22.419
<i>What's going on</i>
<i>with the election?</i>

24:32.512 --> 24:33.972
Reporter:
<i>In the middle of a pandemic,</i>

24:34.055 --> 24:37.267
<i>almost 150 million</i>
<i>Americans voted.</i>

24:37.350 --> 24:38.935
President Donald Trump:
<i>No, I'm not thinking about</i>

24:39.019 --> 24:41.605
<i>concession speech</i>
<i>or acceptance speech yet.</i>

24:41.688 --> 24:44.816
<i>Losing is never easy,</i>
<i>not for me, it's not.</i>

24:44.900 --> 24:46.526
Andrew:
<i>The morning after</i>
<i>I hung out with Roman,</i>

24:46.610 --> 24:49.237
<i>the final results</i>
<i>for the election were in.</i>

24:52.032 --> 24:58.997
Bi-i-i-i-du-uh-un!

24:59.080 --> 25:00.999
Former Vice President Joe Biden

25:01.082 --> 25:04.502
has been elected President
of the United States.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.548
Yeah!

25:08.632 --> 25:09.466
Yeah!

25:09.549 --> 25:10.759
Person: Wa-hoo!

25:10.842 --> 25:12.928
How about that Joe Biden?

25:13.011 --> 25:13.929
Whoo.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.263
Both: Biden.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.723
I wanted him to win,
and he won.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.391
Yeah.
This election took forever,

25:18.475 --> 25:20.101
and so we're so happy
to, like, have a result

25:20.185 --> 25:21.269
and it's the one we wanted.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.562
Kamala is in the White House.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.522
Joe's in the House!
Joe's in the House.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.399
It's a beautiful day
in America.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.901
This dude, that's my homeboy.

25:27.984 --> 25:31.446
He bisexual. I seen him
with a bitch on one side

25:31.529 --> 25:33.907
and a, no homo,
good-lookin' dude on the other.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.367
He got paid $1,500,

25:35.450 --> 25:37.744
and they all went
big deep up in Trump.

25:37.827 --> 25:38.870
-What?
-Yeah.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.080
-What do you mean?
-They were fucking Trump.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.289
Had, like, a threesome
with Trump.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.749
Came on his face
and all that shit.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.961
Motherfucker suckin' dick.
God bless America.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.629
I designed this flag
on my balcony

25:47.712 --> 25:48.964
in the middle of a pandemic,

25:49.047 --> 25:51.841
and I'm proud of this country
for pulling through.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.677
I'm so fuckin' happy.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.428
Happy we got
this fucking cockroach

25:55.512 --> 25:56.763
out of town, baby.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.848
-Woo-hoo!
-(horn toots)

25:58.932 --> 25:59.849
What about Hunter?

25:59.933 --> 26:00.976
Hunter Biden,

26:01.059 --> 26:02.978
Joe Biden's son
who's a nitwit,

26:03.061 --> 26:05.355
a drug addict,
got kicked out of the Navy.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.940
But his dad
became vice president.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.817
Nobody's talkin'
about Hunter.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.694
How come Hillary Clinton's
not in jail?

26:10.777 --> 26:12.946
You can give me the finger
all you want, bro.

26:13.029 --> 26:14.281
I believe that he got robbed,

26:14.364 --> 26:16.574
but I don't believe Joe Biden's
gonna be the president

26:16.658 --> 26:17.951
once the courts
are through with him.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.453
And I'm gonna tell you
somethin' that's really bad.

26:20.537 --> 26:24.582
I didn't vote, but Donald Trump
started somethin'

26:24.666 --> 26:26.001
that they can't stop.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.087
Yo, fuck Donald Trump.
Yo, suck my dick, nigga.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.005
(screams)

26:30.088 --> 26:31.214
Reveler:
Suck my dick, Joe!

26:31.298 --> 26:33.925
Suck my dick, Joe!

26:34.009 --> 26:36.136
Donald Trump,
we smokin' you tonight.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.721
We're smokin' on
that Trump hat, girl.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.889
Suck my fuckin' dick, nigga.
Suck my dick.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.683
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

26:41.766 --> 26:43.893
Fuck Donald Trump.
Suck my dick.

26:43.977 --> 26:44.978
(all scream)

26:45.061 --> 26:47.188
Donald Trump,
suck my dick, nigga.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.982
-Fuck you.
-Person: Fuck that nigga, Trump.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.192
You are Queens in the building.
They can suck my dick.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.945
Fuck Donald Trump!
Fuck Donald Trump!

26:54.029 --> 26:55.905
Suck my dick, Donald Trump!

26:55.989 --> 26:57.282
He helped with the scammin'
and shit,

26:57.365 --> 26:58.325
but he's out of here now.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.326
We don't need him no more.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.577
Can I just say,

27:00.660 --> 27:02.537
Señora Vice President.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.000
Crowd:
Yeah!

27:07.083 --> 27:09.169
This is
for Donald Trump fool!

27:09.252 --> 27:10.920
Eh-hah, fuck Trump.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.507
Tequila.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.884
I love him. He's so hot.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.178
Him and Barack Obama are, like,
the hottest presidents.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.013
I loved Obama.
I don't love Joe Biden.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.473
We gotta, we gotta,
we gotta check him

27:21.556 --> 27:22.724
every now and then,
you feel me?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.225
I think
he's a great placeholder.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.062
I think we'll be able to make
progress in the meantime.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.314
And I'm happy to have
somebody who is enough.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.524
I don't personally fuck
with Kamala,

27:31.608 --> 27:33.568
and I don't politically fuck
with her either,

27:33.651 --> 27:34.861
but she's kinda sick.

27:34.944 --> 27:35.945
She's a Scorpio.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.364
-What's your sign?
-I'm a Taurus.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.366
That's the best sign!

27:39.449 --> 27:41.034
I think everyone here
is delus--

27:41.117 --> 27:43.328
deluding themselves,
but, you know, that's okay.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.871
We're all here to have fun.
Biden won.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.539
I guess Trum--
everyone can go back to brunch.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.667
Everyone can just, you know,
weed's legalized,

27:49.751 --> 27:52.212
heroin's legalized,
so just tap out.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.129
Whoo!

27:53.213 --> 27:55.382
Democracy forever, dude.
We did it.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.758
(laughs)

27:56.841 --> 27:58.760
We saved the country.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.096
Fuck yeah.
We saved the country.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.224
Whoo! Everything's
all amazing right now, man.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.850
It's a big party forever.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.520
Person in pig mask:
Neither one of them
is gonna help us out at all.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.938
It's revolution time.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.899
We back to
regularly scheduled racism.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.776
They need to change the judges.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.695
We need new rules.
We need new laws.

28:17.779 --> 28:18.947
We need a new world.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.073
What does your sign say?

28:20.156 --> 28:23.410
The sign says,
"This is only the beginning."

28:23.493 --> 28:24.994
What's the end?

28:25.078 --> 28:27.414
There is no end.
(laughs)

28:27.497 --> 28:31.376
People starving,
people dying,

28:31.459 --> 28:33.795
people have no jobs,

28:33.878 --> 28:35.797
people sick.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.799
Everything is wrong.

28:37.882 --> 28:42.303
It's time to get, to make change
on this planet.

28:42.387 --> 28:47.892
Rich get richer,
and the poor get poorer.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.979
This is only the beginning.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.190
You know,
while the left kinda drifted

28:54.274 --> 28:57.902
into this new period
of fragmented disunity,

28:57.986 --> 28:59.737
the right wing
was tightening up.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.406
And, uh, within a week

29:01.489 --> 29:04.325
they organized an event called
the Million MAGA March

29:04.409 --> 29:06.619
where one million
Trump supporters

29:06.703 --> 29:09.664
<i>pledged to hit the streets</i>
<i>of D.C. in the, uh,</i>

29:09.747 --> 29:12.292
the largest-ever rally
to Stop The Steal.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.462
Person:
<i>This is only the beginning...</i>
(voice echoing)

29:20.300 --> 29:23.261
Protester:
And we're winning!

29:23.344 --> 29:27.098
(crowd shouting and cheering)

29:27.182 --> 29:28.808
(shouting continues)

29:28.892 --> 29:31.811
The Satanist pedophiles
the Democrats represent

29:31.895 --> 29:34.272
knew the world awakening
was here.

29:34.355 --> 29:36.774
They control the corporations.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.568
They control Hollywood.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.278
They control the blue cities
and blue states

29:40.361 --> 29:41.237
and other governments.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.156
And they're gonna stay
locked down

29:43.239 --> 29:44.741
until you all go on welfare

29:44.824 --> 29:47.118
so they can force you
to waive your rights

29:47.202 --> 29:49.162
to be forcibly inoculated.

29:49.245 --> 29:50.830
(crowd shouting)

29:50.914 --> 29:52.332
Alex Jones:
We declare independence

29:52.415 --> 29:54.250
from the enemy
of America, CNN.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.210
Crowd:
Yes.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.836
And we declare independence

29:56.920 --> 29:59.422
from that Communist
Chinese agent Joe Biden

29:59.506 --> 30:01.466
and his demonic
pedophile family.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.551
(crowd cheers)

30:03.635 --> 30:06.846
Never submit to Satan
and these globalist pedophiles,

30:06.930 --> 30:10.099
and we will defeat
their new world order. Amen.

30:10.183 --> 30:13.478
I don't consciously
make stuff up for an audience.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.731
I've got stacks of news
that is just the craziest stuff

30:16.814 --> 30:18.233
in the world
going on everywhere.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.485
Uh, and people can't believe
what's real.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.903
I mean,
animal-human clones.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.197
Uh, they've been growing
humanoids in utero

30:24.280 --> 30:26.324
up to term inside cows.

30:26.407 --> 30:27.825
And we're talkin' about
30-, 40-pound babies.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.245
They're designed, uh,
they're part bovine, part cow.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.955
So they can
then harvest the organs.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.081
They have spiders--

30:33.164 --> 30:34.749
spider-goats,
goats that are part spider.

30:34.832 --> 30:36.626
They produce body armor
out of their milk.

30:36.709 --> 30:39.212
They tried to recruit my dad
into that in the 1980s.

30:39.295 --> 30:41.381
He didn't get into it, but a lot
of his colleagues took the job

30:41.464 --> 30:43.383
and, uh, never saw 'em
again basically.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.801
By the way, that's, that's real
what I just told you.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.803
The pedophile globalists

30:46.886 --> 30:49.430
and their attempted
election steal

30:49.514 --> 30:52.767
and the Clinton blackmail rings
have only summoned

30:52.850 --> 30:55.812
the sleeping giant
that is America.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.772
(crowd cheers)

30:57.855 --> 31:02.652
And you, you are
the tip of the spear.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.945
(cheering continues)

31:04.028 --> 31:05.989
Trump is our president.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.574
Trump is our president.

31:07.657 --> 31:11.119
Crowd:
Trump is our president!
Trump is our president!

31:11.202 --> 31:13.079
The proletariat,
as they're called,

31:13.162 --> 31:15.707
really likes
dumbed-down stuff.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.459
And-and-and so it's because
I talk to them at their level.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.129
USA! USA!

31:21.212 --> 31:22.213
Crowd:
USA!

31:22.297 --> 31:23.715
I think that's why
we've been successful.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.800
I think people resonate
with the fact that this is real.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.969
-Freedom.
-Crowd: Freedom.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.721
-Freedom.
-Crowd: Freedom.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.306
I also have never tried
to organize people

31:31.389 --> 31:33.975
to offensively cross the line

31:34.058 --> 31:35.310
and go out
and kill globalists.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.562
All these globalist
Democrat mayors

31:37.645 --> 31:40.231
are enemies
and the equivalent of Nazis.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.984
And the American people
have a right and a duty

31:43.067 --> 31:45.653
to resist
by any means necessary.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.614
(crowd cheering)

31:47.697 --> 31:50.825
Saturday, November 14th, 2020

31:50.908 --> 31:53.828
will be celebrated
for hundreds of years

31:53.911 --> 31:56.914
as the second
American Revolution.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.000
1776!

31:59.083 --> 32:00.918
Crowd:
1776!

32:01.002 --> 32:02.754
1776!

32:02.837 --> 32:04.547
Crowd:
1776!

32:04.631 --> 32:06.174
Alex Jones:
<i>1776!</i>

32:06.257 --> 32:08.885
The name of my show
is<i> Information War</i> ,

32:08.968 --> 32:11.262
In-fo-War,<i> InfoWar</i> ,

32:11.346 --> 32:13.848
not physical war, In-fo-War.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.683
No, when I'm being an actor,
it's very, very clear.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.352
I eat babies.
I eat 'em every night.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.853
I eat 'em, you know,
with barbecue sauce.

32:18.936 --> 32:21.272
And I flew to the moon
last night with a witch.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.316
And I took DMT
with Easter bunnies.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.984
Now, now, that's
an example of being crazy.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.653
<i>I mean, this is art.</i>

32:26.736 --> 32:28.363
<i>And I'm not saying</i>
<i>what I do politically is art.</i>

32:28.446 --> 32:30.490
<i>But, but,</i>
<i>but everything is an art form.</i>

32:30.573 --> 32:33.618
Hunga-ah-hunga
hey-hungalalala.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.662
Ooh. Oh, yeah, more.

32:35.745 --> 32:36.871
(moaning)

32:37.997 --> 32:38.790
1776.

32:38.873 --> 32:39.999
-Andrew: More?
-I've had enough.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.167
My fuckin' eyes. Ah!

32:41.250 --> 32:43.378
(groans) Oh shit.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.421
You know, i-it's, like, beauty's
in the eye of the beholder

32:45.505 --> 32:48.383
so if you give somebody
a FEMA camp document,

32:48.466 --> 32:49.550
no one cares about that.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.052
<i>But if you have, like,</i>

32:51.135 --> 32:53.054
<i>a piece of toast</i>
<i>with the Virgin Mary on it,</i>

32:53.137 --> 32:54.263
<i>well, the splash is bigger,</i>

32:54.347 --> 32:56.516
<i>so the, the system</i>
<i>dumbs it down for them</i>

32:56.599 --> 32:58.685
<i>so they can project</i>
<i>whatever they want onto it.</i>

32:58.768 --> 33:00.061
The globalists think
you're weak.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.479
They're tryin' to take you
and your families over. Resist.

33:01.562 --> 33:02.980
Protester:
We'll always fight.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.359
Andrew:
<i>Alex Jones may have</i>
<i>been deplatformed</i>

33:06.442 --> 33:08.027
<i>from YouTube and Facebook,</i>

33:08.111 --> 33:10.238
<i>but at the Million MAGA March</i>
<i>along with thousands</i>

33:10.321 --> 33:11.531
<i>of other deplatformed patriots</i>

33:11.614 --> 33:14.450
<i>pushed off the internet</i>
<i>and into the streets,</i>

33:14.534 --> 33:16.452
<i>he was absolute king.</i>

33:16.536 --> 33:18.746
Think about it, right?
You got a guy who already says

33:18.830 --> 33:21.666
that there's some massive
deep state conspiracy out

33:21.749 --> 33:23.626
to silence him
and his followers.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.504
And then you silence him
and his followers.

33:26.587 --> 33:27.672
You know,
for someone like him,

33:27.755 --> 33:29.757
that only really adds
to his credibility.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.884
Alex Jones:
<i>The Proletariat,</i>
<i>as they're called,</i>

33:31.968 --> 33:35.263
<i>really likes</i>
<i>dumbed-down stuff.</i>

33:37.390 --> 33:39.642
Give me Liberty
or give me death!

33:39.726 --> 33:41.269
No more fraud!

33:41.352 --> 33:44.230
We need to revote
in all seven swing states.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.858
I am one thousand percent sure
that he is going

33:46.941 --> 33:48.192
to get it again,
four more years.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.402
I have no doubt whatsoever.

33:49.485 --> 33:51.654
I have never doubted it
for a nanosecond.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.072
You know,
one thing that I wanna,

33:53.156 --> 33:54.741
you know, make clear
about the Million MAGA March

33:54.824 --> 33:58.286
is that at this specific march,
the vibe was very optimistic.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.912
I mean,
I would say 95 percent

33:59.996 --> 34:01.247
of the people at this event

34:01.330 --> 34:03.040
thought that the election
would be overturned

34:03.124 --> 34:03.916
within a couple days.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.960
Crowd:
Jesus is great.

34:06.043 --> 34:07.295
Yes!

34:07.378 --> 34:10.131
(singing)
<i>♪ Still I love standing up ♪</i>

34:10.214 --> 34:12.717
<i>♪ For my Jesus ♪</i>

34:12.800 --> 34:15.803

Stop the steal.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.305
Stop the steal.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.432
I'm inspired right now
with all these beautiful people

35:01.516 --> 35:03.309
<i>supporting Trump,</i>
<i>being awoke,</i>

35:03.392 --> 35:05.478
<i>realizing what's going on</i>
<i>in the world right now.</i>

35:05.561 --> 35:07.480
<i>And it's truth versus lies.</i>

35:07.563 --> 35:10.024
You can see that from the media,
from Facebook, from CNN.

35:10.107 --> 35:13.528
My dad was just on Facebook,
and, uh, and his friend.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.821
And they were trying
to livestream

35:14.904 --> 35:16.030
what's happening right now.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.824
Both of their accounts
are now,

35:17.907 --> 35:19.242
they're, they're not
letting 'em post.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.576
The dollar is powerful,

35:20.660 --> 35:21.702
and it's dictating

35:21.786 --> 35:23.454
what all of us see
on a daily basis.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.456
So it's those,
those kinda actions

35:25.540 --> 35:27.166
that do nothin'
but make you lose faith.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.793
Anything with Biden
gets overlooked.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.254
Anything with the Biden family
gets overlooked.
What about Hunter?

35:31.337 --> 35:32.964
What if I told you
I've got pictures of Hunter,

35:33.047 --> 35:35.591
and I got naked pictures
of Hunter doin' crack cocaine?

35:35.675 --> 35:38.553
You know, did we look at that?
Did we look at the fraud?

35:38.636 --> 35:40.429
Did we look at that?
No, we didn't.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.223
We didn't look into it,
did we? No.

35:42.306 --> 35:45.685
Andrew:
<i>So Joe Biden's son Hunter</i>
<i>had a crack problem,</i>

35:45.768 --> 35:47.728
<i>more specifically</i>
<i>a filming himself</i>

35:47.812 --> 35:49.272
<i>while smoking crack problem.</i>

35:49.355 --> 35:50.940
<i>He's done it, like,</i>
<i>four times.</i>

35:51.023 --> 35:53.693
<i>One of the key stories in the,</i>
<i>uh, Stop The Steal mythology</i>

35:53.776 --> 35:55.194
<i>is about Hunter Biden's laptop.</i>

35:55.278 --> 35:57.655
<i>Basically, they think</i>
<i>there's way worse stuff on it</i>

35:57.738 --> 35:59.073
<i>than the crack-smoking video</i>

35:59.156 --> 36:01.325
<i>and that China is holding</i>
<i>the laptop hostage</i>

36:01.409 --> 36:03.411
<i>and has successfully</i>
<i>blackmailed Joe Biden</i>

36:03.494 --> 36:04.954
<i>in helping them</i>
<i>hack voting machines</i>

36:05.037 --> 36:06.539
<i>and steal the election</i>
<i>away from Trump.</i>

36:06.622 --> 36:07.957
He holds the key to everything.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.542
If that would
have been exposed,

36:09.625 --> 36:11.419
we, we wouldn't be here
right now.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.087
I talked to a Chinese lady
out here,

36:13.170 --> 36:15.256
and she said that
he's in China.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.257
Hidin' Biden.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.009
Dave:
China bribes people.

36:18.092 --> 36:21.804
They've been sitting
on Joe Biden's son's laptops,

36:21.888 --> 36:23.723
plural, for years now.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.516
They'll get you drunk,
they'll get you drugs,

36:25.600 --> 36:27.977
and the next thing you know,
you'll wake up in bed

36:28.060 --> 36:30.271
with a nine-year-old girl.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.523
And they got it on tape.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.858
So now what do you do?

36:33.941 --> 36:36.527
You get on the wrong side
of these sons of bitches,

36:36.611 --> 36:37.820
and they will destroy
your life.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.614
D-denounce me
as a piece of filth,

36:39.697 --> 36:41.490
or you might get in trouble.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.408
I don't wanna call you that.

36:42.491 --> 36:43.784
No. Z-Zuckerberg
and others said,

36:43.868 --> 36:46.579
"You can only speak to me
if it's a negative light."

36:46.662 --> 36:47.663
Th-that's
an official pronouncement.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.915
That's not a cult
or anything.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.917
That's not tyranny.
That's good.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.086
Uh...

36:54.170 --> 36:57.089
Just say,
"You're a despicable person."

36:57.173 --> 36:59.133
Well, th-th-the algorithm
doesn't know. It's a computer.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.968
Just say, "You are filth,
I hate you.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.553
"I'm here
to expose you, garbage.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.681
Alex Jones is filth.
Alex Jones is bad."

37:07.224 --> 37:09.268
-Alex Jones is bad?
That's good.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.478
I like the hair down.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.063
I'm not normally gay,
but I'd kinda like to run

37:12.146 --> 37:13.272
my fingers through it
a little bit.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.609
Oh my gosh.
Maybe Bigfoot's hiding in here.

37:16.692 --> 37:18.903
Oh, Bigfoot,
are you in there?

37:18.986 --> 37:21.781
If we do not accelerate
our resistance now,

37:21.864 --> 37:24.033
they're gonna come
after<i> InfoWars</i> even more, okay.

37:24.116 --> 37:25.743
You need to understand that.
I need your prayers.

37:25.826 --> 37:28.329
I need your financial support.
InfoWarsstore.com.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.248
You need DNA Force Plus.
You need the fish oil.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.501
<i>You need vita-mineral fusion.</i>
<i>The fight is now.</i>

37:33.584 --> 37:36.003
Andrew:
<i>If you watch an hour-long</i>
InfoWars<i> segment,</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:37.463
<i>probably 20 minutes</i>
<i>of it is just</i>

37:37.546 --> 37:40.424
<i>full-blown advertisements</i>
<i>for anti-globalist products</i>

37:40.508 --> 37:43.302
<i>like Dr. Jones</i>
<i>extra chill Kava pills,</i>

37:43.386 --> 37:45.346
<i>and a wide catalog</i>
<i>of T-shirts, mugs,</i>

37:45.429 --> 37:46.514
<i>hats, bullet-proof vests,</i>

37:46.597 --> 37:48.349
<i>flags, backpacks,</i>
<i>essential oils,</i>

37:48.432 --> 37:51.185
<i>and all sorts of New Age</i>
<i>holistic supplements.</i>

37:51.268 --> 37:52.103
So while it was true

37:52.186 --> 37:53.437
that everyday people
on the right

37:53.521 --> 37:54.522
were being censored

37:54.605 --> 37:56.107
and kicked off
social media,

37:56.190 --> 37:58.567
it only just pushed them
to alt platforms

37:58.651 --> 38:00.778
and into tighter
and tighter echo chambers.

38:00.861 --> 38:04.949
And then right into the hands
of the profiteers like Alex.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.951
It's estimated that in 2017,

38:07.034 --> 38:09.203
Alex Jones made $10 million

38:09.286 --> 38:10.913
selling merchandise
and subscriptions.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.833
<i>But that could never compare</i>
<i>to our businessman president</i>

38:13.916 --> 38:18.212
<i>who in 2017 made $25 million</i>
<i>selling MAGA hats.</i>

38:18.295 --> 38:23.134
(crowd cheering)

38:24.135 --> 38:25.553
(sirens wailing)

38:26.637 --> 38:27.638
What's happening today in D.C.?

38:27.722 --> 38:29.056
Just, like, out here, like,

38:29.140 --> 38:30.725
resisting Nazis and fascists.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.143
And of course,
they're not welcome here.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.436
This is a very sacred space.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.896
We're outside of
Black Lives Matter Plaza.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.273
I think that there's a reason
that they're here

38:37.356 --> 38:38.566
at Black Lives Matter Plaza.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.026
I think that they're looking
to target Black people.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.694
They're looking to target
people of color

38:41.777 --> 38:43.612
and also members
of the LGBTQ community.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.156
Every one
of these motherfuckers,

38:45.239 --> 38:46.407
I want 'em to come at me,

38:46.490 --> 38:48.034
so I can throw
some fuckin' hands.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.327
Dude, how bout y'all come at me?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.831
Fuck you.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.875
Fuck Antifa.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.961
Protester:
What do you mean?
How am I the Nazi?

38:59.045 --> 39:01.839
You guys are the ones
breakin' a bunch of shit.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.424
Answer me that.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.387
(screaming)

39:08.471 --> 39:10.097
Person:
<i>Get the fuck outta here, bitch!</i>

39:11.515 --> 39:14.435
-Hey, get off.
-(woman screams)

39:14.518 --> 39:16.395
BLM Protester:
<i>So we're all warnin'</i>
<i>when we see them comin'</i>

39:16.479 --> 39:19.398
<i>through</i>
<i>Black Lives Matter Plaza</i>
<i>with their Trump gear on.</i>

39:19.482 --> 39:20.900
<i>They're takin' pictures of us</i>

39:20.983 --> 39:22.902
<i>to put up on</i>
<i>their racist websites.</i>

39:22.985 --> 39:24.236
That's a sign right there.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.362
What they were tryin' to do

39:25.446 --> 39:27.198
was incite hatred
and violence.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.324
And as you can see,

39:28.407 --> 39:30.743
it has manifested itself
over this weekend.

39:30.826 --> 39:33.913
Reporter:
<i>Overnight, fireworks exploding</i>
<i>in the streets of D.C.</i>

39:33.996 --> 39:35.706
<i>At least 20 arrests made.</i>

39:35.790 --> 39:38.000
So one thing that I learned
from covering events like this

39:38.084 --> 39:39.877
is that when
there is violence,

39:39.960 --> 39:41.837
you know, in political contexts
like this,

39:41.921 --> 39:44.048
it's pretty much always
between Antifa

39:44.131 --> 39:46.801
<i>and their mortal enemy,</i>
<i>the Proud Boys.</i>

39:46.884 --> 39:49.011
Person:
<i>The Proud Boys</i>
<i>are best described</i>

39:49.095 --> 39:51.806
<i>as a fringe group</i>
<i>on the far right.</i>

39:55.351 --> 39:57.269
Andrew:
<i>The group was founded in 2016</i>

39:57.353 --> 39:59.772
<i>by a Canadian hipster</i>
<i>named Gavin McInnes,</i>

39:59.855 --> 40:01.482
<i>who also co-founded</i>
Vice<i> magazine.</i>

40:01.565 --> 40:06.195
Women do earn less in America
because they choose to.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.822
Andrew:
<i>His rants on Fox News</i>

40:07.905 --> 40:09.490
<i>garnered him</i>
<i>a small cult following,</i>

40:09.573 --> 40:10.783
<i>but in 2017,</i>

40:10.866 --> 40:13.452
<i>a first-degree Proud Boy</i>
<i>and neo-Nazi</i>

40:13.536 --> 40:15.329
<i>named Jason Kessler organized</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:17.164
<i>that infamous rally</i>
<i>in Charlottesville, Virginia</i>

40:17.248 --> 40:19.166
<i>that turned violent</i>
<i>and resulted in the death</i>

40:19.250 --> 40:20.209
<i>of a protester.</i>

40:20.292 --> 40:23.212
(people screaming)

40:23.295 --> 40:26.423
Shortly after Charlottesville,
Gavin McInnes stepped down,

40:26.507 --> 40:28.467
and, uh, he was replaced
by an Afro-Cuban

40:28.551 --> 40:32.346
<i>gun rights activist from Miami</i>
<i>named Enrique Tarrio.</i>

40:32.429 --> 40:34.557
I'm a person of color, right?
I'm Cuban.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.392
So our message
has never been about race.

40:36.475 --> 40:39.728
So Enrique had just spent
six months in a federal prison

40:39.812 --> 40:41.605
<i>for selling millions</i>
<i>of dollars' worth</i>

40:41.689 --> 40:45.317
<i>of expired diabetic test strips</i>
<i>on the streets of Miami.</i>

40:45.401 --> 40:48.112
He was sort of brought in
pretty clearly

40:48.195 --> 40:49.738
to try to rebrand
the Proud Boys

40:49.822 --> 40:52.992
<i>as some kind of anti-racist,</i>
<i>free speech guardian group.</i>

40:53.075 --> 40:54.326
So I went
to go find Enrique

40:54.410 --> 40:56.829
and figure out what he was doing
in D.C. that day.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.128
Enrique Tarrio:
<i>They'd been using</i>
<i>the word "resist"</i>

41:04.211 --> 41:05.296
for the past four years.

41:05.379 --> 41:08.424
And I think "resist" is,
is such a dumb word.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.050
Because "resist"
means that you're,

41:10.134 --> 41:11.218
you're put on the defense.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.345
A revolt is,
is a better word.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.181
And it doesn't mean
that it has to be violent.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.099
I'm saying, like, we need
to go on the offense.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.976
The Proud Boys go out
and protect the innocent.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.186
They go out
and protect the people

41:20.269 --> 41:21.770
exercising
their first amendment.

41:21.854 --> 41:22.813
The Rufio punch,

41:22.897 --> 41:25.065
that's the legend,
most legendary pun--

41:25.149 --> 41:27.318
it's the punch heard
around the world.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.486
(heavy metal music playing)

41:33.282 --> 41:35.492
You were in the zone, man.
You're like, it's like
a video game.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.702
Ethan Nordean:
<i>Yeah, Gavin McInnes says,</i>

41:36.785 --> 41:38.162
<i>you know,</i>
<i>"Violence isn't great,</i>

41:38.245 --> 41:40.414
<i>but justified violence</i>
<i>is amazing."</i>

41:40.498 --> 41:42.791
That you just have
to eliminate them as a threat.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.668
I, I can't imagine
what would have happened

41:44.752 --> 41:46.795
if we weren't there. Um...

41:46.879 --> 41:48.589
Uh, he literally knocked
the soul

41:48.672 --> 41:50.758
out of this little
soy boy Antifa.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.551
-Knocked the soul out--
-Guy was attacking him
with a baton--

41:52.635 --> 41:54.845
Yes, he was attacking him
with a baton, absolutely.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.513
It was self-defense
100 percent.

41:56.597 --> 41:59.767
The founding fathers didn't
envision, like, this, right?

41:59.850 --> 42:01.894
They didn't envision
all of this, all these beauti--

42:01.977 --> 42:03.437
the--
this beautiful infrastructure.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.772
They, they didn't--

42:04.855 --> 42:06.148
Person 1: What's up?

42:06.232 --> 42:07.566
Person 2:
Hey, we're just
checkin' you out.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.735
Person 1:
You think what you're doin'
will scare me?

42:09.818 --> 42:11.528
I will fuck
one of y'all up.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.613
Then do it. Then fuck it up.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.241
Come on, hit me.
Come on, Pussy.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.992
Well, so I came all the way
over here to hit you?

42:17.076 --> 42:19.036
You said you were
gonna fuck me up, right--

42:19.119 --> 42:20.621
Listen, we asked you
a question.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.581
You don't know me. You don't
know nothin' I'm about.

42:22.665 --> 42:23.958
You motherfuckers is stupid.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.834
Until you keep
fuckin' running your mouth.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.002
Shut the fuck up.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.213
You guys are arguing
with a fuckin' retard.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.924
You're, you're playing
fucking chess with a pigeon.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.051
If we were what
the mainstream media said,
that kid would--

42:34.134 --> 42:35.719
that guy would have been
demolished immediately.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.972
-Yep.
-If we were what the mainstream
media claims us to be,

42:38.055 --> 42:39.181
he would have been done.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.975
Cameras or no cameras,

42:41.058 --> 42:43.936
he would have been done,
if we were who they say we are.

42:44.019 --> 42:46.563
We're, we're some
ultra-right wing

42:46.647 --> 42:50.734
racist, violent, uh,
street gang they call us, right?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.112
Then why didn't we just beat up
that Black man right there?

42:53.195 --> 42:55.698
And we just proved it
right there.

42:55.781 --> 42:57.866
The truth is we're not,
we're not like these,

42:57.950 --> 43:00.494
this violent mob
of a gang or anything.

43:00.577 --> 43:02.329
And if my presence
is provocation,

43:02.413 --> 43:04.081
then, you know what,
so be it. I'll take it.

43:04.164 --> 43:05.708
Andrew: For sure.
Can we check your shirt out?

43:07.084 --> 43:08.377
(chuckles)

43:09.670 --> 43:11.005
Enrique:
<i>I am a Western Chauvinist,</i>

43:11.088 --> 43:14.091
and I refuse to apologize
for creating the modern world.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.553
<i>Proud Boys is</i>
<i>a drinking club.</i>

43:17.636 --> 43:19.346
<i>We're a drinking club</i>

43:19.430 --> 43:20.848
<i>We're a drinking club</i>

43:22.725 --> 43:24.560
<i>It's a men's group.</i>
<i>It's a drinking club.</i>

43:24.643 --> 43:27.187
Patriot club.
Actually, no, I'm sorry.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.189
A drinking club
with a patriot problem.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.774
I don't drink.
No.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.193
This is actually--
that's why it's full.

43:33.277 --> 43:36.697
I haven't drank in,
like, 12 years.

43:38.574 --> 43:41.994
I thrive in the, the anarchy
of, of all this shit.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.829
I, I had
a pretty cool childhood.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.664
You know, I was
a little rebellious fuck.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.334
I used to break into cars.
We used to steal cars.

43:48.417 --> 43:50.461
Nissans are pretty easy.
You hotwire 'em.

43:50.544 --> 43:52.421
Hondas are super easy,
same thing.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.298
High-end cars,
you need keys.

43:54.381 --> 43:55.966
You want to say
I'm guilty of something else?

43:56.050 --> 43:59.053
Manipulating fuckin'
mainstream media? Yes.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.512
Proud Boys is
a drinking club.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.014
-With a--
-Is that how
you would define it?

44:02.097 --> 44:03.057
-Okay.
-Yeah.

44:05.559 --> 44:06.852
Andrew:
<i>So how do you make money?</i>

44:06.935 --> 44:08.771
Enrique:
<i>I started this, this shop</i>

44:08.854 --> 44:10.898
<i>called 1776.shop.</i>
<i>And we sell all sorts</i>

44:10.981 --> 44:13.484
<i>of conservative merchandise</i>
<i>and apparel.</i>

44:13.567 --> 44:15.527
<i>We started this store</i>
<i>as a hobby.</i>

44:15.611 --> 44:16.945
<i>T-shirts, mugs, hats.</i>

44:17.029 --> 44:19.239
<i>I'm a T-shirt mogul,</i>
<i>T-shirt king.</i>

44:19.323 --> 44:20.324
(kisses)
Ha!

44:20.407 --> 44:21.450
<i>When we get on the news,</i>

44:21.533 --> 44:23.577
<i>we'll do about $5,000,</i>
<i>$10,000 a day.</i>

44:23.660 --> 44:25.204
Think our best day
for business

44:25.287 --> 44:28.082
was when Biden
mentioned us in the debates.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.458
-Proud Boys.
-(overlapping chatter)

44:29.541 --> 44:32.711
Proud Boys, stand back
and stand by.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.631
(patriotic music playing)

44:37.257 --> 44:39.301
I might have left-wing sites

44:39.385 --> 44:41.178
that sell
left-wing merchandise.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.721
Andrew:
You make Joe Biden merch?

44:42.805 --> 44:43.680
Maybe.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.641
I know how to put food
on my table.

44:45.724 --> 44:47.351
Like, you could
take away my status.

44:47.434 --> 44:48.769
You could take away
my voice.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.729
I'm gonna find a way
to do something.

44:50.813 --> 44:54.191
(echoing)<i> We're a drinking club</i>

to this transmission

45:04.660 --> 45:05.994
you are the resistance.

45:16.296 --> 45:17.589
Ah, well,
these guys came in,

45:17.673 --> 45:20.134
you guys came in
for a fuel filter replacement.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.803
Yeah, well, we found
a cock in the block.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.263
-What?
-A cock in the block.

45:24.346 --> 45:28.392
There's a rooster nesting up
under the undercarriage in here.

45:28.475 --> 45:30.519
-Like an actual live chicken?
-Yes, sir.

45:30.602 --> 45:31.979
Mechanic:
What the fuck?

45:32.062 --> 45:33.856
-Andrew: Is it alive or dead?
-Mechanic: It's alive.

45:33.939 --> 45:35.774
And if you feel as though
he needs to get outta there,

45:35.858 --> 45:37.443
I feel like you guys
should crawl up under there

45:37.526 --> 45:40.320
and get that chicken
out of there, personally.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.324
Friend:
You see it?

45:44.408 --> 45:46.618
Andrew:
Yeah. There's a chicken
in the RV.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.454
He looks fuckin' scared, man.

45:48.537 --> 45:49.997
-Friend: He's scared?
-Andrew: Yeah.

45:50.664 --> 45:51.790

46:27.075 --> 46:30.621
CN suck-- CNN sucks.

46:31.997 --> 46:34.875
CNN is taking
a massive, pffff,

46:34.958 --> 46:36.168
crap on this country.

46:36.251 --> 46:37.544
They took a bunch
of laxatives,

46:37.628 --> 46:38.712
and they're just crapping

46:38.795 --> 46:40.547

46:40.631 --> 46:42.633
They're crappin' all over

46:42.716 --> 46:45.260
Trump doesn't poo
on the American flag.

46:45.344 --> 46:48.096
President Trump diarrheas
in Joe Biden's mouth.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.389
Joe Biden loves

46:49.473 --> 46:51.183
that Trump diarrhea
right in his mouth,

46:51.266 --> 46:52.559
right all over his face.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.063
(thumping)

46:56.146 --> 46:57.814
This is a stolen election
through this

46:57.898 --> 46:59.066
(thump) crap right here.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.692
There's what
the socialists are usin'

47:00.776 --> 47:01.860
to take our country.

47:01.944 --> 47:04.905
(thump) No more mail-in ballots,
Mr. Mailbox.

47:04.988 --> 47:07.324
Damn it to hell!

47:07.407 --> 47:09.868
Andrew:
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>I heard talk of a coup.</i>

47:09.952 --> 47:11.745
I pray for peaceful revolution,

47:11.828 --> 47:13.705
but I'm prepared
for a violent revolution.

47:13.789 --> 47:16.250
When tyranny becomes law,
rebellion becomes duty.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.501
A-and that's where I'm at.

47:17.584 --> 47:19.586
Will you accept Joe Biden
as your president?

47:19.670 --> 47:23.090
Fuck no. Bushmaster AR-15,
Smith & Wesson 40 cal.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.675
I-I'm locked and loaded
and ready to roll.

47:24.758 --> 47:27.219
There has to be blood.
This is a communist revolution.

47:27.302 --> 47:29.596
And I'll tell you
right now, bro.
I'm fuckin' in here, man.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.098
Ready to die for my country.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.349
<i>We don't want that shit, man.</i>

47:32.432 --> 47:34.309
It's capitalism,
not communism, man.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.269
I love guns.

47:35.352 --> 47:36.478
I love this country.

47:36.562 --> 47:37.729
That's all it is to it.

47:37.813 --> 47:38.772
Fuck Antifa.

47:38.855 --> 47:40.732
Fuck CNN too. Fake news.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.193
Does anybody in the world
that's not watching CNN

47:43.277 --> 47:46.321
-think that this is
an honest election?
-Person: Yeah!

47:46.405 --> 47:48.657
If you do,
then I feel sorry for you.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.784
The part-- the time
for praying is done.

47:50.867 --> 47:52.744
Jesus was not a pacifist.

47:52.828 --> 47:56.498
When he saw the tyranny,
he turned over the tables.

47:56.582 --> 47:58.625
This is it.
This is the tyranny.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.127
Andrew:
<i>Despite the fighting words</i>

48:00.210 --> 48:03.338
<i>of a lot of these people,</i>
<i>nobody was sure exactly how</i>

48:03.422 --> 48:04.881
or when this coup
was gonna go down.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.466
It was more abstract.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.260
<i>And to add insult to injury,</i>

48:08.343 --> 48:09.803
<i>Antifa was on scene</i>

<i>yelling at</i>

<i>and militia members</i>

48:14.266 --> 48:15.309
<i>about the KKK.</i>

48:15.392 --> 48:18.854

No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!

48:18.937 --> 48:23.150
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!

48:23.233 --> 48:26.778
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!

48:26.862 --> 48:30.365
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!

48:30.449 --> 48:31.825
How did they gather
those folks?

48:31.908 --> 48:34.786
Excuse my language.
And who the fuck's paying them?

48:34.870 --> 48:36.663
George Soros's son

48:36.747 --> 48:38.915
has already had evidence
against him

48:38.999 --> 48:40.459
with these folks down here.

48:40.542 --> 48:43.045
We think that they're trying
to steal our election.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.338
<i>Who's bussin' 'em in?</i>

48:44.421 --> 48:47.257
Group:
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!

48:47.341 --> 48:49.009
We knew that
there were white supremacists,

48:49.092 --> 48:50.677
Proud Boys, and InfoWars
in our city,

48:50.761 --> 48:53.013
so we just wanted to make sure
they're not welcome here.

48:53.096 --> 48:54.890
The Proud Boys
are gonna fuckin' come at us.

48:54.973 --> 48:57.142
We got one. We got the leader
right fuckin' there

48:57.225 --> 48:58.518
in my goddamn city.

49:00.979 --> 49:02.856
I would say
that I am an anarchist,

49:02.939 --> 49:04.232
a socialist, a communist.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.443
I believe in socialism
because I want the,

49:06.526 --> 49:10.697
I believe that the workers own
their right to production.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.325
Starbucks employees
should be able to own

49:13.408 --> 49:15.035
the machines
that make the coffee.

49:15.118 --> 49:18.080
But above all else,
I'm anti-fascist.

49:18.163 --> 49:20.165
When Donald Trump
takes over office,

49:20.248 --> 49:21.708
you guys are the ones
goin' to jail

49:21.792 --> 49:23.585
for being like this
at this event, bro.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.878
Are you really gonna wear
the muzzle?

49:24.961 --> 49:26.880
Like, you look like livestock
walkin' around.

49:26.963 --> 49:28.924
'Cause, look, your entire body's
covered in holes,

49:29.007 --> 49:31.551
so why cover the one part
that shows your personality?

49:31.635 --> 49:35.180
Where, where are all the holes
that your body is covered in?

49:35.263 --> 49:36.723
Have you ever heard of a pore?
Do you sweat?

49:36.807 --> 49:39.142
So we're full of holes.
Do we agree? Are you a stone?

49:39.226 --> 49:41.144
Listen to me, lady.
You see that tower right there?

49:41.228 --> 49:42.521
That's called 5G, okay.

49:42.604 --> 49:45.857
Right there, right there,
right there, right there.

49:45.941 --> 49:46.858
60 millihertz.

49:46.942 --> 49:48.360
You're walking around basically

49:48.443 --> 49:49.945
on chemotherapy.

49:50.028 --> 49:52.906
(engine revving)

49:52.989 --> 49:55.200
Biden's a child molester.

49:56.451 --> 49:58.537
And he kidnaps children

49:58.620 --> 50:00.497
and does horrible things
to them,

50:00.580 --> 50:04.209
just like Hillary Clinton
and Obama who made the virus.

50:04.292 --> 50:08.088
The virus is manmade.
It doesn't exist.

50:08.171 --> 50:09.965
Kids need to be
put back in school.

50:10.048 --> 50:12.259
The people who are pulling
the strings

50:12.342 --> 50:14.219
is the Italian Vatican.

50:14.302 --> 50:16.430
They actually are
reptilian bloodlines

50:16.513 --> 50:17.764
from another planet.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.224
They're basically robots.

50:19.307 --> 50:20.851
And the evil people
that are there

50:20.934 --> 50:23.270
such as the Rothschilds
who suck blood of,

50:23.353 --> 50:25.564
out of children
to get adrenaclome

50:25.647 --> 50:27.232
and stay young
and beautiful forever.

50:27.315 --> 50:30.152
They pick 'em up,
and they take 'em to a submarine

50:30.235 --> 50:33.947
and go underground until they
can get to Epstein island,

50:34.030 --> 50:35.866
which is where
they molest children.

50:36.908 --> 50:38.118
(indistinct chatter)

50:38.201 --> 50:39.745
Child:
That's the ice breaker.

50:39.828 --> 50:42.748
Group: Ohhh!

50:42.831 --> 50:43.790
Child 1:
Hey, get that thing off.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.333
-Child 2: Stop!
-(pops)

50:45.417 --> 50:46.460
Uh-oh, he's got the pistol.

50:46.543 --> 50:50.297
Get him. Ah, ah, ah.
Head shot.

50:50.380 --> 50:53.049
-(laughter)
-Person: Whoa, whoa!

51:01.641 --> 51:02.809
I went to McDonald's today,

51:02.893 --> 51:03.977
and I wanted
to get a muffin.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.979
And I found human teeth
in my muffin.

51:06.062 --> 51:07.439
Andrew:
Uh-oh. So, so what's,

51:07.522 --> 51:08.732
what's inside McDonald's food?

51:08.815 --> 51:10.776
Um, I think it's, like,
ground-up children.

51:10.859 --> 51:12.736
People do evil shit,
that's it.

51:12.819 --> 51:14.905
And these people have
plenty of opportunity,

51:14.988 --> 51:16.406
they got more money than God.

51:16.490 --> 51:17.949
I think the military's
gonna arrest

51:18.033 --> 51:19.034
the whole damn government.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.285
Some people say
that there's gonna be

51:20.368 --> 51:22.829
a blackout,
no television except for,

51:22.913 --> 51:25.457
um, Donald J. Trump screening
on live news.

51:25.540 --> 51:28.585
<i>And what he's gonna do</i>
<i>is he's going to,</i>

51:28.668 --> 51:30.879
um, lock up all
the other pedophiles

51:30.962 --> 51:33.632
and reptilian bloodlines
and put them in jail.

51:33.715 --> 51:35.634
Where do you get
your information from?

51:35.717 --> 51:36.635
The dark stream media.

51:36.718 --> 51:38.303
Like I said,
what you have to do is

51:38.386 --> 51:39.846
you have to go search
around the normal media

51:39.930 --> 51:42.766
for someone who knows how to get
into the dark stream media.

51:42.849 --> 51:45.852
And another pl-- good place
to track is the Trump media,

51:45.936 --> 51:48.563
which is actually
telling all the truth.

51:48.647 --> 51:51.900
At this point, I'd never
actually gone on a Q board.

51:51.983 --> 51:55.779
So for the first time,
I had Jayden's dad, Brandon,

51:55.862 --> 51:58.740
take me headfirst
into QAnon.pub,

51:58.824 --> 52:00.200
which is the main Q board.

52:00.283 --> 52:01.451
(clicking tongue)

52:01.535 --> 52:03.537
Brandon Spencer:
Let me see here.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.205
<i>Now you have to understand</i>
<i>that he speaks</i>

52:05.288 --> 52:06.414
<i>in, in cryptic code.</i>

52:06.498 --> 52:07.666
<i>There's actually a Q clock</i>

52:07.749 --> 52:09.543
<i>that you have to decipher</i>
<i>all this stuff from.</i>

52:09.626 --> 52:11.878
Andrew:
So this, this is
an actual Q drop?

52:11.962 --> 52:13.338
Brandon:
Yup. Anderson Cooper.

52:13.421 --> 52:15.757
And you can see
all the Satanic, uh, artwork

52:15.841 --> 52:17.884
in the background,
which is just, just troubling.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.220
I mean, you have a man here
getting burned alive

52:20.303 --> 52:21.930
while there's some sort
of Satanic ritual

52:22.013 --> 52:23.056
going around
in the background.

52:23.139 --> 52:24.558
I see
that sacrifice is misspelled.

52:24.641 --> 52:25.809
Do you think
that's also cryptic?

52:25.892 --> 52:26.977
Brandon:
Yeah, absolutely.

52:27.060 --> 52:27.894
These, these guys are smart.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.020
Anything that's misspelled,

52:29.104 --> 52:30.188
anything that looks out
of the ordinary,

52:30.272 --> 52:31.022
there's something to it.

52:31.106 --> 52:32.357
The purpose of the movement

52:32.440 --> 52:34.276
is to,
is to question everything.

52:34.359 --> 52:36.736
Inside the pepper,
you have that upside down

52:36.820 --> 52:38.488
kinda triangle, if you will.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.907
This is the sign
for a boy lover, right here.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.118
Whoo. Go Trump.

52:43.201 --> 52:44.911
He's still your president!

52:44.995 --> 52:48.999
He's still your president!
He's still your president!

52:49.082 --> 52:50.542
Mother:
They are very, very good kids.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.961
We're very blessed,
and that's why I'm comfortable

52:53.044 --> 52:55.130
with making the decision
to keep them out of school,

52:55.213 --> 52:56.548
even if that means
they don't have

52:56.631 --> 52:57.674
all the friends to be around.

52:57.757 --> 52:58.967
And, you know,

52:59.050 --> 53:00.802
I don't want
my kids wearing masks.

53:00.886 --> 53:02.220
Andrew:
Do you guys miss
going to school?

53:02.304 --> 53:03.430
-Um, yup.
-Um, very much.

53:03.513 --> 53:05.390
It's, um, it's, it's not the--

53:05.473 --> 53:07.267
the virus is manmade
like my dad said,

53:07.350 --> 53:09.436
so it's worthless
not going to school.

53:09.519 --> 53:10.896
But we're gonna have
to wear the mask, like,

53:10.979 --> 53:13.607
for 24/7 if we have to go back,
except, like, on weekends.

53:13.690 --> 53:15.025
Imagine if
the coronavirus never exists,

53:15.108 --> 53:16.443
would you like
to go back to school?

53:16.526 --> 53:17.777
Um, yeah. I really like--

53:17.861 --> 53:19.613
I miss all my friends.
My mom, my mom is saying that

53:19.696 --> 53:21.072
'cause she wants
to home-school us,

53:21.156 --> 53:23.033
but the only thing that's
holding her back is our friends.

53:23.116 --> 53:25.577
I don't have a lot of friends.
I just have, like, one or two.

53:25.660 --> 53:27.579
You have a t-- I have zero.

53:27.662 --> 53:29.414
Andrew:
You have zero? Come on,
everyone has one friend.

53:29.497 --> 53:30.832
-I'm your, I'm your friend.
-You have us at least.

53:30.916 --> 53:31.833
-Okay.
-Andrew: Yeah.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.293
Which friend
do you miss the most?

53:33.376 --> 53:35.629
-Um, probably, like, Kaitlin.
-Andrew: Why?

53:35.712 --> 53:37.380
'Cause she's, like,
the only one who gets me.

53:37.464 --> 53:40.008
Mother:
It's sad that they don't have
a lot of friends to play with

53:40.091 --> 53:43.970
but I think in the long run,
they'll be better adults,

53:44.054 --> 53:46.556
having a better education
than being popular.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.602

54:07.243 --> 54:08.745
regardless of what color
you are

54:08.828 --> 54:10.789
if you snatched a cop's taser

Look. Look behind you.

Look. Look at this shit
right here.

54:19.714 --> 54:20.924
You see this man,
Rayshard Brooks?

54:21.007 --> 54:24.010
Police just brutally murdered
a man right here.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.887
Didn't even give a fuck.
You feel me?

54:25.971 --> 54:27.013
Protester: (on megaphone)
<i>Say his name.</i>

54:27.097 --> 54:28.515

Rayshard Brooks.

54:28.598 --> 54:30.850
Andrew:
<i>Shortly before my meeting</i>
<i>with the Spencer family,</i>

54:30.934 --> 54:32.852
<i>a 27-year-old man</i>
<i>named Rayshard Brooks</i>

54:32.936 --> 54:34.604
<i>had been killed</i>
<i>by police officers</i>

54:34.688 --> 54:36.648
<i>in a Wendy's parking lot.</i>

54:36.731 --> 54:38.149
<i>Protests erupted,</i>
<i>which resulted</i>

54:38.233 --> 54:39.651
<i>in the burning of the Wendy's</i>

54:39.734 --> 54:41.486
<i>and the accidental killing</i>
<i>of a young girl</i>

54:41.569 --> 54:43.029
<i>due to a stray bullet.</i>

54:43.113 --> 54:45.156
He was, he was,
he came to get some food

54:45.240 --> 54:47.075
for his family
from the Wendy's.

54:47.158 --> 54:49.536
He was a little intoxicated,
you feel me?

54:49.619 --> 54:51.830
So he parked his car
in this parkin' lot.

54:51.913 --> 54:54.249
-Fell asleep.
-Fell asleep in the car.

54:54.332 --> 54:56.918
The police got him out the car,
asked him some questions.

54:57.002 --> 54:59.170
And that shit went left.

54:59.254 --> 55:02.257
It wasn't Black people
that burned this Wendy's down.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.259
Who, who burned
the Wendy's down?

55:04.342 --> 55:06.761
It was actually
a Caucasian female.

55:06.845 --> 55:08.847
Then a little girl
got killed right there

55:08.930 --> 55:11.057
in the parking lot we just left
before gettin' the bottle.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.726
Person 1:
A little girl got killed.

55:12.809 --> 55:14.477
Person 2:
Well, that shit
took a little girl, man.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.229
Fuck 12, man.

55:16.312 --> 55:18.481
I love Wendy's though.
Y'all got that good
four-for-four.

55:18.565 --> 55:19.691
I fuck with that, though.

55:19.774 --> 55:22.318
Rest in peace, Rayshard Brooks,
Breonna Taylor,

55:22.402 --> 55:25.113
and everybody we lost this year
to police brutality,

55:25.196 --> 55:27.741
COVID-19, 'cause my granny
had COVID.

55:27.824 --> 55:29.784
She beat it.
That shit is real.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.286
Everybody take care
of their self.

55:31.369 --> 55:33.288
More folks might start
joinin' us right now.

55:33.371 --> 55:34.831
-(laughter)
-We might--
we had this shit packed.

55:34.914 --> 55:35.999
The whole street--

55:36.082 --> 55:38.752
Oh man, here we go again
with this bullshit.

55:38.835 --> 55:41.880
(indistinct chatter)

55:46.843 --> 55:48.511
So what do you guys wanna be
when you grow up?

55:48.595 --> 55:49.888
Basketball star.

55:49.971 --> 55:51.681
Person:
Oh, oh, let's close the gate.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.600
(indistinct chatter)

55:53.683 --> 55:54.768
Football star.

55:54.851 --> 55:56.603
Andrew: What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

55:57.395 --> 55:58.438
I wanna be myself.

55:58.521 --> 56:01.107
How's, how's 2020 been
so far for you guys?

56:01.191 --> 56:02.776
Good and bad
at the same time.

56:02.859 --> 56:04.069
What do you mean?

56:04.152 --> 56:06.237
My cousin died.

56:06.321 --> 56:08.656
He was just mindin'
his own business.

56:08.740 --> 56:12.202
Then he got robbed, and...

56:12.285 --> 56:13.995
Person:
Young kids get ready
for the count.

56:14.079 --> 56:15.955
...they pulled out
a gun on him

56:16.039 --> 56:19.417
and then shot him four times
in the back.

56:19.501 --> 56:24.714
(indistinct chatter)

56:25.548 --> 56:26.758
That's my one wish,

56:26.841 --> 56:28.301
to see him again.

56:28.384 --> 56:29.803
I would just give him a hug.

56:29.886 --> 56:31.805
All three of us is brothers.

56:31.888 --> 56:34.057
-Andrew: What'd you say?
-All three of us is brothers.

56:34.140 --> 56:35.433
Which one of you guys
is the oldest?

56:35.517 --> 56:36.643
Him.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.436
We've got to show
the kids this ain't right.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.146
Like, they gotta
look up to us. Shit.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.607
We the next generation.
They the next generation.

56:42.690 --> 56:44.609
Everybody tired of everything.
We're tired of sittin'
in the house.

56:44.692 --> 56:46.569
We're tired of gettin'
fed lies, bullshit.

56:46.653 --> 56:47.654
Hey, it don't matter
who president.

56:47.737 --> 56:48.863
It ain't gonna never change.

56:48.947 --> 56:51.491
Same thing gonna
always be goin' on in the world

56:51.574 --> 56:53.201
what's goin' on now.
See what I'm sayin'?

56:53.284 --> 56:55.787
Like, hey, only person who can
make the world better is God.

56:55.870 --> 56:56.788
That's to me.

56:56.871 --> 56:58.123
It really made me think about,

56:58.206 --> 56:59.791
like, how much free time

56:59.874 --> 57:02.085
and also financial stability
it really takes

57:02.168 --> 57:05.255
to show face at the kind
of angry pep rallies

57:05.338 --> 57:07.590
<i>that I had been going to</i>
<i>for the past couple months</i>

57:07.674 --> 57:08.883
<i>prior to that.</i>

57:08.967 --> 57:11.010
So many Americans'
primary concern

57:11.094 --> 57:12.804
is just getting by,
you know?

57:12.887 --> 57:15.473
They don't have time
to fly to D.C.,

57:15.557 --> 57:18.268
get their Trump gear,
and just yell about shit

57:18.351 --> 57:19.686
that's probably not
gonna happen.

57:19.769 --> 57:22.230
<i>It was also hard to believe</i>
<i>that just two miles away</i>

57:22.313 --> 57:24.274
<i>from where I interviewed</i>
<i>those kids in the projects</i>

57:24.357 --> 57:25.692
<i>was the Spencer family</i>
<i>household,</i>

57:25.775 --> 57:27.986
<i>where they live</i>
<i>in absolute fear of reptiles</i>

57:28.069 --> 57:30.780
<i>and Rothschilds stealing</i>
<i>everything from them.</i>

57:30.864 --> 57:32.991
<i>I mean, they basically live</i>
<i>next door</i>

57:33.074 --> 57:34.409
<i>to a segregated housing project</i>

57:34.492 --> 57:36.369
<i>where people's primary concern</i>
<i>is making ends meet</i>

57:36.452 --> 57:38.538
<i>and ultimately</i>
<i>escaping poverty.</i>

57:38.621 --> 57:40.498
<i>It, it made me wonder</i>
<i>if it would ever be possible</i>

57:40.582 --> 57:42.417
<i>to bridge that gap</i>
<i>in understanding</i>

57:42.500 --> 57:43.543
<i>and, more importantly,</i>

57:43.626 --> 57:45.253
<i>how much power</i>
<i>an American president</i>

57:45.336 --> 57:47.755
<i>really has in a four-year term</i>
<i>to fix a country</i>

57:47.839 --> 57:49.591

And that's, like, really sums up
a lot of this thing,

1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:15.716
is, like, you finally get
these people to the edge,

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.718
it's like, "Here it is.
Do what you want,"

1:08:17.802 --> 1:08:20.179

livestream and get arrested.

Wow, what a great video.

1:08:25.893 --> 1:08:27.478

1:08:38.030 --> 1:08:39.281
(cheering)

1:08:39.365 --> 1:08:41.408
I couldn't help but wonder,

1:08:41.492 --> 1:08:44.954
to them, what the point
of all this really was.

1:08:46.789 --> 1:08:49.583
I can't blame people for lookin'
for meaning, you know.

1:08:49.667 --> 1:08:53.087
And, like, people look
for meaning in all sorts
of fucked up weird ways.

1:09:49.018 --> 1:09:52.354
Where were the people
who gave them the confidence

1:09:52.438 --> 1:09:53.522

1:09:55.691 --> 1:09:56.817
(sighs)

1:09:58.777 --> 1:10:00.654
I'm not gonna lie
like the left does.

1:10:00.738 --> 1:10:02.406
Antifa and some people

1:10:02.489 --> 1:10:03.741
in the Proud Boys
claim they were with it,

1:10:03.824 --> 1:10:05.242
and some people
in the Oath Keepers.

1:10:05.326 --> 1:10:07.536
I'm not against those groups,
but some people in those groups,

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:08.746
not their leaders,

1:10:08.829 --> 1:10:12.416
went there to go into
the Capitol and to do that.

1:10:12.499 --> 1:10:14.501
What happened at the Capitol
helps the deep state.

1:10:14.585 --> 1:10:16.337
What happened at the Capitol
helps the authoritarians.

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:18.297
What happened at the Capitol
is not good for any American.

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:20.758
And now,
anybody that types 1776

1:10:20.841 --> 1:10:24.303
from now on is,
is an insurrectionist.

1:10:24.386 --> 1:10:27.431
There was no plan
of action here

1:10:27.514 --> 1:10:29.516
by anybody, period.

1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:31.435
And if,
if somebody planned it,

1:10:32.561 --> 1:10:34.521

1:11:06.011 --> 1:11:08.514
There's a difference between
informant and cooperation.

1:11:08.597 --> 1:11:10.933
Cooperation's when
you're cooperating with the,

1:11:11.016 --> 1:11:14.895
the federal agency
to lower your sentence.

1:11:14.979 --> 1:11:17.273
Informing is when
you're just doing it.

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:18.607
In your 1776 speech

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:20.651
at the Million MAGA March
when you were, like, you know,

1:11:20.734 --> 1:11:21.902
<i>"The people</i>

1:11:24.905 --> 1:11:26.490
do you feel like
with such big crowds

1:11:26.573 --> 1:11:28.367
there's gonna be someone there
who is, like--

1:11:28.450 --> 1:11:30.661
doesn't see that you're talking
about an information war

1:11:30.744 --> 1:11:32.329
and hears you yell "1776"

1:11:32.413 --> 1:11:34.206
and has images of the
American Revolutionary War in--

1:11:34.289 --> 1:11:36.333
I think that's fair.
I think that's fair.

1:11:36.417 --> 1:11:39.503
But, I mean, it was also
Q people at the Capitol,

1:11:39.586 --> 1:11:43.048
uh, who really believe that
they were there for Trump.

1:11:43.132 --> 1:11:44.341
And they, they believed
they were there

1:11:44.425 --> 1:11:45.968
'cause the 8chan board
was saying,

1:11:46.051 --> 1:11:47.511
"It's the storm,
get up and take over."

1:11:47.594 --> 1:11:49.930
Alex Jones was already
in defense mode.

1:11:50.014 --> 1:11:51.807
He was doing whatever
he possibly could

1:11:51.890 --> 1:11:56.478
to blame the Capitol riot
on someone that wasn't himself.

1:11:56.562 --> 1:11:58.480
We saw Q-tards with Antifa

1:11:58.564 --> 1:11:59.857
goin' to the Capitol
and do this,

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.317
and that's all QAnon is,

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.653
is Nigerian email scams 5.0.

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:06.530
And, and this is what
I get accused of

1:12:06.613 --> 1:12:08.323
by the media
is what Q does.

1:12:15.247 --> 1:12:17.916
The name of my show
is<i> Information War</i> ,

1:12:19.251 --> 1:12:21.462
In-fo-War,<i> InfoWar</i> ,

1:12:21.545 --> 1:12:24.131
not physical war,
not offensive war,

1:12:24.214 --> 1:12:25.716
not atomic war,
not hydrogen war,

1:12:25.799 --> 1:12:27.760
not chemical war,
not biological war.

1:12:27.843 --> 1:12:29.595
In-fo-War.

1:12:29.678 --> 1:12:31.555
So we're gonna
crush them with the truth.

1:12:31.638 --> 1:12:34.600
Dear God, thank you for
all our family and friends

1:12:34.683 --> 1:12:36.226
and protecting us.

1:12:36.310 --> 1:12:37.811
Thank you for all the friends

1:12:37.895 --> 1:12:39.813
that are recording
our every movement.

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:43.525
And thank you for this food,
all our dogs. Amen.

1:12:43.609 --> 1:12:45.819
After this,
can we go play Nintendo with--

1:12:45.903 --> 1:12:47.154
(indistinct chatter)

1:12:47.237 --> 1:12:48.072
We got a new dog.

1:12:48.155 --> 1:12:50.157
-You got a new dog?
-Yeah.

1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:52.576
Got a new dog,
we got a new president.

1:12:52.659 --> 1:12:53.911
Andrew:
Last time we were here,
we talked a lot

1:12:53.994 --> 1:12:55.496
about the QAnon drops.

1:12:55.579 --> 1:12:57.873
Did you feel
a little bit let down

1:12:57.956 --> 1:13:02.086
when a lot of the predictions
of the Q universe didn't happen?

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:06.340
Kind of, yes,
because everything

1:13:06.423 --> 1:13:08.592
that I researched
seemed so real.

1:13:08.675 --> 1:13:12.638
Like, Disney and all these
horrible companies

1:13:12.721 --> 1:13:15.307
that continue to brainwash us.

1:13:15.390 --> 1:13:19.937
And when Q was wrong
and didn't predict anything,

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:21.897
basically just made it up,

1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:25.526
it was very hard to believe
that Q was still-- existed.

1:13:25.609 --> 1:13:26.777
Brandon:
It makes you feel like that.

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:29.279
It makes you feel like
it was all for nothin'.

1:13:29.363 --> 1:13:30.781
And then what I keep
going back to is,

1:13:30.864 --> 1:13:34.076
"Okay, if it was all bullshit,
if it all was a lie,

1:13:34.159 --> 1:13:35.619
then what was the point?"

1:13:35.702 --> 1:13:37.621
With my dad being into Q,
I felt like

1:13:37.704 --> 1:13:40.332
they were manipulating him
the whole way.

1:13:40.415 --> 1:13:42.126
Andrew:
Mm-hmm. Why?

1:13:42.209 --> 1:13:43.877
Because they wanted
to get everybody divided.

1:13:43.961 --> 1:13:46.505
'Cause my dad would spend
countless hours outside

1:13:46.588 --> 1:13:49.967
by himself on his phone
watching Q

1:13:50.050 --> 1:13:52.010
and watching
all this Trump stuff.

1:13:52.094 --> 1:13:53.846
Andrew:
What do you feel like
the point was?

1:13:55.055 --> 1:13:57.099
I really felt like
there was no point.

1:14:00.102 --> 1:14:01.728
Andrew:
<i>January 6th felt like</i>

1:14:01.812 --> 1:14:03.897
<i>a fitting end</i>
<i>to the Trump presidency.</i>

1:14:03.981 --> 1:14:06.066
The true believers
were getting arrested,

1:14:06.150 --> 1:14:08.152
while the people
who pushed them into action,

1:14:08.235 --> 1:14:10.362
<i>for the most part,</i>
<i>were nowhere to be found.</i>

1:14:10.445 --> 1:14:12.823
Meanwhile,
the news machine defaulted.

1:14:12.906 --> 1:14:16.201
I am in tears today
to see this scene.

1:14:16.285 --> 1:14:18.912
December 7th, 1941.

1:14:19.872 --> 1:14:22.708
September 11th, 2001.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:25.544
And January 6th, 2021.

1:14:25.627 --> 1:14:27.379
We observe 9/11.

1:14:27.462 --> 1:14:31.925
We have to observe the 6th
of January every single year.

1:14:32.009 --> 1:14:33.177
Today was a disgrace.

1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:37.472
What a crazy, sad day.

1:14:37.556 --> 1:14:38.932
Right-wing media,
on the other hand,

1:14:39.016 --> 1:14:41.101
<i>couldn't even stomach</i>
<i>the fire they'd fueled.</i>

1:14:41.185 --> 1:14:43.103
<i>They pretended like</i>
<i>nothing really happened.</i>

1:14:43.187 --> 1:14:45.856
All that stuff they're puttin'
on these other stations, like,

1:14:45.939 --> 1:14:48.025
"Oh, it was
the biggest riots in history."

1:14:48.108 --> 1:14:48.901
No, it wasn't.

1:14:48.984 --> 1:14:50.527
If you were to listen to,

1:14:50.611 --> 1:14:53.113
to Fox News and MSNBC
and CNN,

1:14:53.197 --> 1:14:54.823
they were telling us
that all hell

1:14:54.907 --> 1:14:56.200
was gonna break loose tonight,

1:14:56.283 --> 1:14:58.535
as if this was BLM
and Antifa.

1:14:58.619 --> 1:14:59.870
Andrew:
<i>And not a moment passed</i>

1:14:59.953 --> 1:15:02.039
<i>before Trump's</i>
<i>hardcore soldiers attempted</i>

1:15:02.122 --> 1:15:04.416
<i>to explain it away</i>
<i>to fit their own narrative.</i>

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:05.709
So the idea
that you're not allowed

1:15:05.792 --> 1:15:07.836
to see the inside
of the Capitol is insane.

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:09.838
The idea that the public
has a clear interest

1:15:09.922 --> 1:15:12.925
in knowing what happened
that day is real.

1:15:13.008 --> 1:15:14.718
The Capitol Riot

1:15:14.801 --> 1:15:17.679
is a steaming crock
of hog drippings.

1:15:17.763 --> 1:15:20.474
Everybody was in a good mood.
They saw Trump speak.

1:15:20.557 --> 1:15:22.267
I remember seein' people
climbin' in trees

1:15:22.351 --> 1:15:23.936
to even get
a glimpse at this.

1:15:24.019 --> 1:15:26.104
It was just, like,
"What a time to be alive."

1:15:28.982 --> 1:15:31.693
Dave:
<i>I think Nancy Pelosi</i>
<i>and those people</i>

1:15:31.777 --> 1:15:34.196
<i>set all of that up.</i>

1:15:34.279 --> 1:15:38.116
They had Antifa go in
dressed as MAGA people.

1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:40.077
Dave: (on phone)
<i>In the following video,</i>

1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.831

<i>Antifa terrorists.</i>

<i>We apologize</i>
<i>if your name appears</i>

1:15:47.793 --> 1:15:49.962
<i>and you are not Antifa.</i>

1:15:50.045 --> 1:15:54.800
We've been living
in a deception.

1:15:54.883 --> 1:15:57.386
It worked for a while
until social media came along.

1:15:57.469 --> 1:16:01.556
And social media is the one
that got Trump in, the outsider.

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.976
And he's about as far
from a pedophile

1:16:04.059 --> 1:16:05.352
as you're gonna get.

1:16:05.435 --> 1:16:06.478
He's after these people,

1:16:06.561 --> 1:16:08.355
and that's why
they're after him.

1:16:11.316 --> 1:16:13.277
Pffff. Pedophile.

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:14.820
Pedophile, definitely.

1:16:14.903 --> 1:16:16.697
Because she eats the babies.

1:16:17.489 --> 1:16:18.448
Oh yeah.

1:16:18.532 --> 1:16:21.451
I call him creepy sleepy
chomo Uncle Joe.

1:16:21.535 --> 1:16:23.412
What's j-- what is--
what does chomo mean?

1:16:23.495 --> 1:16:25.122
Chomo is a,
is a jailhouse term

1:16:25.205 --> 1:16:26.748
for child molester.

1:16:28.458 --> 1:16:30.294
Pfff. Pedophile.

1:16:32.587 --> 1:16:34.548
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

1:16:38.844 --> 1:16:41.555
On May 19th, 1999,

1:16:41.638 --> 1:16:45.350
you were convicted
of sexual abuse

1:16:45.434 --> 1:16:46.268
in the first degree

1:16:46.351 --> 1:16:49.313
and sodomy
in the second degree

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:52.899
of an eight-year-old boy
in New Jersey.

1:16:52.983 --> 1:16:54.901
So, according to this paper,

1:16:54.985 --> 1:16:58.155
you are a registered
sex offender

1:16:58.238 --> 1:16:59.906
and a convicted pedophile.

1:16:59.990 --> 1:17:01.450
On a false conviction.

1:17:01.533 --> 1:17:03.785
-You want to take
a look at this?
-I know. I've seen the paper.

1:17:03.869 --> 1:17:05.495
I pled, because I knew--

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:06.997
-Andrew: You pled guilty?
-Dave: Yeah, becau--

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:08.332
I did what Michael Flynn did.

1:17:08.415 --> 1:17:10.709
I knew I couldn't win.

1:17:10.792 --> 1:17:12.586
Have you ever heard
the term projection before?

1:17:12.669 --> 1:17:15.797
-Andrew: Do you feel like--
-Yeah. Hillary Clinton
does it all the time.

1:17:15.881 --> 1:17:17.424
Andrew: Do you feel like
maybe you're projecting by--

1:17:17.507 --> 1:17:19.009
No, I'm not projecting.

1:17:19.092 --> 1:17:22.679
I am engaging in revenge.

1:17:22.763 --> 1:17:25.390
How are you going
to get revenge? Are you--

1:17:25.474 --> 1:17:27.267
I'm gonna get revenge
by takin' down

1:17:27.351 --> 1:17:29.436
the whole goddamn cabal.

1:17:31.104 --> 1:17:34.274
Like the protagonist
in<i> Law Abiding Citizen,</i>

1:17:34.358 --> 1:17:36.818
I'm gonna pull this whole
fuckin' corrupt temple down

1:17:36.902 --> 1:17:38.528
around your fuckin' head.

1:17:38.612 --> 1:17:40.238
And that's what I'm gonna do.

1:17:49.247 --> 1:17:51.875
In Dave,
I sort of saw a man

1:17:51.958 --> 1:17:54.252
projecting his own shame

1:17:54.336 --> 1:17:57.089
and, and using the mythology
of, of Trump

1:17:57.172 --> 1:18:00.175
and of his political movements
and conspiracies

1:18:00.258 --> 1:18:04.596
<i>to assign meaning</i>
<i>to a broken life.</i>

1:18:04.679 --> 1:18:06.223
<i>To jump down</i>
<i>the conspiracy rabbit hole,</i>

1:18:06.306 --> 1:18:09.434
I think that, uh,
if you fail yourself

1:18:09.518 --> 1:18:11.520
or you've been failed
by the world,

1:18:12.312 --> 1:18:13.897
it provides a way out.

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:25.784
<i>By the time I got back to D.C.</i>
<i>for Biden's Inauguration Day,</i>

1:18:25.867 --> 1:18:28.453
<i>it was as if nothing</i>
<i>had ever happened.</i>

1:18:28.537 --> 1:18:30.080
<i>The streets</i>
<i>were completely dead.</i>

1:18:30.163 --> 1:18:31.957
<i>No Biden supporters cheering,</i>

1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:35.168
<i>and no Trumpers</i>
<i>back for round two.</i>

1:18:36.503 --> 1:18:38.755

<i>back to normal,</i>

1:18:38.839 --> 1:18:41.133
<i>making YouTube videos</i>
<i>with my friends.</i>

1:18:41.216 --> 1:18:44.886
<i>The news media had returned</i>
<i>to its perpetual crossfire.</i>

1:18:44.970 --> 1:18:47.806
<i>Alex went back</i>
<i>to selling supplements.</i>

1:18:47.889 --> 1:18:49.891
<i>Enrique went back</i>
<i>to selling T-shirts.</i>

1:18:49.975 --> 1:18:52.978
<i>And Forgiato Blow</i>
<i>was back in the studio.</i>

1:18:53.061 --> 1:18:55.105
<i>A lot of people got rich,</i>

1:18:55.188 --> 1:18:56.982
<i>and a lot of people's lives,</i>
<i>and brains,</i>

1:18:57.065 --> 1:18:58.275
<i>were ruined forever.</i>

1:18:58.358 --> 1:19:00.861
<i>We were pitted</i>
<i>against each other for profit</i>

1:19:00.944 --> 1:19:03.113
<i>by organizations</i>
<i>and individuals</i>

1:19:03.196 --> 1:19:04.239
<i>who do not care about us</i>

1:19:04.322 --> 1:19:06.867
<i>and are enriched</i>
<i>from our division.</i>

1:19:06.950 --> 1:19:08.994
<i>But before this ship sailed,</i>
<i>I remember something</i>

1:19:09.077 --> 1:19:10.787
<i>a wise man once told me.</i>

1:19:10.871 --> 1:19:13.415
Wise Man:
<i>Rich get richer,</i>

1:19:13.498 --> 1:19:15.625
<i>and the poor get poorer.</i>

1:19:17.210 --> 1:19:18.420
<i>There is no end.</i>

1:19:18.503 --> 1:19:20.088
There is no end.

1:19:20.172 --> 1:19:23.216
This is only the beginning.
