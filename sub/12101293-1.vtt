WEBVTT

01:28.523 --> 01:30.457
You are a very funny man.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.129
He chose the bear trap.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.298
Yeah, why?

01:38.332 --> 01:41.502
You got a handgun and an axe.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.771
- What's wrong with these?
- They're boring.

01:43.805 --> 01:45.472
- I don't want 'em.
- Oh, man.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.909
Adam, it's called a trap

01:47.942 --> 01:49.644
for a reason.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.379
The intended victim
has to stumble onto it.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.350
And what do the rules say?

01:56.383 --> 01:59.621
The rules, which I believe
we all signed off on,

01:59.654 --> 02:01.522
says that the bear trap mechanic

02:01.556 --> 02:03.524
doesn't function
like other murder weapons.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.528
You cannot wield a bear trap

02:07.562 --> 02:09.463
with intention.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.533
Okay, so I take the gun out

02:12.567 --> 02:14.902
and I shoot him.

02:14.936 --> 02:18.171
Bang, bang, bang!

02:18.205 --> 02:19.507
I killed him.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.274
Not so fast, tiger.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.645
That's a quiet zone,
can't do that.

02:23.678 --> 02:26.413
Gotta go back to the safe house.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.785
Are you gonna tell me
that I can't use a bear trap

02:30.818 --> 02:33.420
and he can fucking
nail clip someone to death?

02:33.453 --> 02:34.722
I mean, he's right there,
tell him yourself.

02:34.756 --> 02:36.524
It was the best option.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.860
And how many points of damage
did the nail clippers do?

02:38.893 --> 02:41.929
- One point.
- And what about,

02:41.963 --> 02:45.198
uh, the baseball bat?

02:45.232 --> 02:47.568
The sword?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.704
Okay, it was
the funniest option.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.440
Actually I can
kinda see your point.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.909
Imagine clipping
your nipple tips.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.410
- Don't.
- Adam.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.912
Barrett's not playing to win.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.446
- Why do I have to play to win?
- Because that's why

02:59.479 --> 03:01.783
- we play games.
- No, that's why you play games.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.663
Ugh, how are we doing?

03:15.697 --> 03:16.931
Still failing.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.472
Still failing.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.975
V.V. Stubbs ever fail
a Gamechanger campaign?

03:28.009 --> 03:29.644
Nope.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.547
Never asked for crowdfunding,
not once.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.849
Literally everything
this guy has ever put out

03:34.882 --> 03:37.350
has been a fucking hit.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.986
I don't know how he does it.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.956
Guys, we made $200 in donations.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.692
We gotta start somewhere, right?

03:44.726 --> 03:47.829
I mean, it doesn't matter
if we never get any of it.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.633
Is someone standing
in the way of your dreams?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.535
Well, I have
the perfect solution.

03:54.569 --> 03:58.371
Just murder, bury, win, yay!

03:58.405 --> 03:59.874
Hi, I'm Adam.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.510
I'm here to tell you about
a new murder mystery board game.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.613
The twist: You're the killer.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.381
I'm not watching
this video again.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.351
Hey, hey, guys, look,
a new donation.

04:11.384 --> 04:15.022
$150 from you know who,
anonymous.

04:15.056 --> 04:17.892
That's five donations,
$350 total,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.794
and all from anonymous.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.395
Five donations,
10 percent of our goal.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.965
That's pretty good
for a first run.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.701
Let's stay optimistic.

04:37.812 --> 04:39.947
Murder, Bury, Win.

04:39.981 --> 04:42.482
Part One: The quick start
guide to murdering

04:42.517 --> 04:45.686
your intended victim.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.455
First rule: Don't freak out.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.925
What do you want?
You know what you want.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.593
You want to kill.

04:52.627 --> 04:54.862
You want to do this.

04:54.896 --> 04:56.396
But can you do this?

04:56.429 --> 04:59.432
Fuck yeah, you can do this.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.835
You can't give up.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.537
You can't stop moving.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.572
You've got to find that person

05:04.605 --> 05:06.641
and, well,

05:06.674 --> 05:08.009
that reminds me.

05:08.042 --> 05:11.913
Second rule:
Find the perfect murder weapon.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.446
And even if
you don't think you can kill

05:13.480 --> 05:16.651
with what you've got,
try to kill 'em anyway.

05:16.684 --> 05:20.121
Third rule:
Don't stop the pursuit.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.356
If he gets out of your grasp,
keep on chasing him,

05:23.390 --> 05:25.960
because if you don't, they will,

05:25.993 --> 05:29.396
and in this game,
there can only be one winner.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.471
Well, you won't find anyone else
that works as hard as I do,

06:11.505 --> 06:13.741
and, um...

06:13.774 --> 06:14.976
What's that?

06:17.178 --> 06:19.046
A record?

06:19.080 --> 06:21.082
Yes, that's part of the.

06:21.115 --> 06:24.051
I mean, does it really matter?

06:24.085 --> 06:26.486
- Yes.
- It does?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.690
Appreciate you checking in.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.158
We'll contact you later...

06:31.192 --> 06:35.763
Hey, um, why don't you
go fuck yourself?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.430
Excuse me?

06:37.464 --> 06:40.167
Adam Hughes speaking.

06:40.201 --> 06:43.470
- Yo, you remember this?
- Oh, yeah, I sure do.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.106
You know it ran on Gamechanger?

06:45.139 --> 06:47.440
- Really?
- I ended up donating to it,

06:47.474 --> 06:49.677
and went all in
for the full reward.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.779
They sent me
this colorful package

06:51.812 --> 06:54.682
with the game inside, a t-shirt,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.717
some stickers.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.819
Campaign made a million dollars.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.755
- Wow.
- Fucking hate this game.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.557
- Really, why?
- Yeah, hell yeah.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.792
It was a simple idea.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.794
Anybody can come up with
crude drawings

07:06.827 --> 07:08.729
and immature humor, you know?

07:08.763 --> 07:11.198
But, I guess if it sells,

07:11.232 --> 07:12.833
that's the kind
of shit people like.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.202
Yeah, did a lot better
than Murder, Bury, Win.

07:15.236 --> 07:17.138
A million times better.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.073
You know, the difference
is that, like, our game

07:19.106 --> 07:20.541
is actually great, you know?

07:20.574 --> 07:23.110
Like, it's nuanced.

07:23.144 --> 07:26.047
Even though it's not finished,
it has just as much depth as

07:26.080 --> 07:29.016
any of these Victor Von Stubbs
games, you know?

07:29.050 --> 07:30.685
I'm telling you,
one day I'm gonna walk

07:30.718 --> 07:33.020
through these doors
and be standing right there

07:33.054 --> 07:36.090
with a copy of the most badass
murder fantasy board game

07:36.123 --> 07:38.759
ever created,
Murder, Bury, Win, you feel me?

07:40.995 --> 07:42.495
Mark my words,

07:42.530 --> 07:44.231
and you know whose names
are gonna be on the box?

07:44.265 --> 07:46.600
Ours.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.738
Meet me in the back, now.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.244
Yes, sir, yes.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.615
Yes.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.551
They're...
they're right here, sir.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.252
They're right here.

08:05.286 --> 08:08.055
Uh, okay, we are live, sir.

08:08.089 --> 08:10.524
- Hello, Adam?
- Yes.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.227
- Am I on speaker?
- You are, sir.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.830
So, I understand I'm speaking
to the three creators

08:15.863 --> 08:17.832
of Murder, Bury, Win.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.668
That would be Adam,
and Barrett, and Chris.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.970
- Is that right?
- That's correct, sir.

08:23.004 --> 08:24.772
- Yes.
- And it's just the three of you

08:24.805 --> 08:26.807
- right now?
- Yes.

08:26.841 --> 08:28.576
Excellent.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.878
First of all, I don't give out
my name over the phone.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.015
It's not a you thing,
it's a safety thing.

08:34.048 --> 08:36.684
- Okay, are you there?
- We're here, sir.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.720
Great, so I understand
you three live in Willits.

08:39.754 --> 08:41.956
- That's correct.
- And are you talking to anyone

08:41.989 --> 08:43.657
- about your game?
- Well, we tried

08:43.691 --> 08:45.826
with the Gamechanger campaign,
but it...

08:45.860 --> 08:47.595
Yeah, yeah, obviously,
are you talking to

08:47.628 --> 08:49.296
any game publishers
about your game?

08:49.330 --> 08:50.898
No, not really.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.035
Not really, or no?

08:54.068 --> 08:55.736
No.

08:55.770 --> 08:57.805
Comic book or young adult
adaptations?

09:00.041 --> 09:02.043
- No.
- Have you taken any steps

09:02.076 --> 09:06.013
to get your game made
beyond the Gamechanger site?

09:06.047 --> 09:07.915
No.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.150
Does anybody know
about your game

09:09.183 --> 09:10.718
outside of the three of you?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.753
- No.
- Absolutely not.

09:12.787 --> 09:14.055
I hear two voices.

09:16.057 --> 09:17.358
I'm sorry, no.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.160
Okay.

09:19.193 --> 09:20.895
If it meant the difference
between your game being made

09:20.928 --> 09:22.930
or disappearing into
Gamechanger obscurity,

09:22.963 --> 09:25.099
could you keep
this conversation a secret?

09:25.132 --> 09:27.868
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

09:27.902 --> 09:31.172
- Sure.
- And I want you to be honest.

09:31.205 --> 09:32.873
Okay?

09:32.907 --> 09:35.142
Is your game any good?

09:37.945 --> 09:42.316
Sir, I believe Murder, Bury, Win
is the next...

09:42.349 --> 09:43.818
Murder Wall.

09:47.822 --> 09:49.824
Come over,
let's talk about your game.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.194
Come over?

09:53.227 --> 09:54.762
I'm close.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.667
Sure, when?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.102
Hey, now is good.

10:01.135 --> 10:03.070
Adam, take me off
the speaker phone.

10:03.104 --> 10:05.272
See ya soon, guys.

10:05.306 --> 10:07.108
Yes, sir.

10:09.143 --> 10:11.278
I'm looking forward to it, too.

10:11.312 --> 10:14.315
Yes, we'll be there very soon.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.961
"Close" my ass.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.729
Seven buses, Adam.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.097
It's just right up this road.

10:30.131 --> 10:31.765
You said that an hour ago.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.034
- I'm saying it now.
- Do you even trust this guy?

10:34.068 --> 10:36.003
- I'm sure it's fine.
- Do you have a picture of him?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.771
- No, why?
- You think he might be

10:37.805 --> 10:39.974
- one of the anonymous donors?
- Probably all of 'em.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.442
No, it's gotta be
different people.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.744
Nope, it's one person,
it's the same IP address.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.913
- You can check that?
- Yeah, sure did.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.349
Hey, I think this is it, guys.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.760
We're going to get
fucking murdered.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.462
- We'll be fine, Barrett.
- You'll be fine, Adam.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.030
Guys.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.079
- Yeah, hey, can you hold this?
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:19.113 --> 11:20.347
Be careful, careful, you got it?

11:20.381 --> 11:22.049
I... I think so,
is this gonna go off?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.384
It might go off,
it's a fucking bear trap.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.852
- Do you got it?
- I think so.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.153
You sure you have it?
Well, get it.

11:26.187 --> 11:27.955
- Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.
- You got it?

11:29.957 --> 11:31.358
Come on in, guys.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.394
Come on in, come on.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.502
Put it back where it goes.

11:40.535 --> 11:43.070
I have a spot for it.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.105
Yeah, you see that?

11:45.139 --> 11:46.907
Right there on the old wall.

11:48.442 --> 11:49.877
The big, empty spot.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.345
Bear trap shaped.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.249
Got it, feel good?

11:55.282 --> 11:57.218
Have a seat.

11:57.251 --> 11:59.053
Make yourself comfortable.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.034
So,

12:14.068 --> 12:16.303
let me see
if I have this straight.

12:16.337 --> 12:19.440
Adam, Barrett,

12:19.473 --> 12:22.209
Chris.

12:22.243 --> 12:24.245
Those are our names.

12:24.278 --> 12:26.080
Relax.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.048
You're not in trouble.

12:28.082 --> 12:31.418
Although I can kinda see why
your Gamechanger didn't pan out.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.556
Why is that?

12:34.589 --> 12:37.258
Uh, because you got people
attacking each other

12:37.291 --> 12:40.227
with bear traps,
and that makes no goddamn sense.

12:40.261 --> 12:43.063
Well, we got the idea from...

12:43.097 --> 12:45.299
Murder Wall, so.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.503
Come on, that's a fantasy.

12:48.536 --> 12:50.037
You get to inhabit
different characters

12:50.070 --> 12:52.039
with weird names
like Captain Custard,

12:52.072 --> 12:55.242
and beat people over the head
with chandeliers.

12:55.276 --> 12:57.244
But, Murder, Bury, Win
is wish fulfillment,

12:57.278 --> 12:59.013
right?

12:59.046 --> 13:02.016
You get to be yourself.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.818
You have a framework that
people want to identify with,

13:04.852 --> 13:06.820
but you're pushing them away
by being unrealistic.

13:08.489 --> 13:10.991
Let me ask you this:

13:11.025 --> 13:13.193
Who hasn't daydreamed
about killing someone?

13:14.629 --> 13:16.196
Come on, show of hands.

13:18.132 --> 13:21.268
Yeah, even I can identify with
wanting to kill a few people.

13:23.538 --> 13:25.939
Three actually, quite recently.

13:28.142 --> 13:30.344
You have a lot of weapons,
Mister...

13:30.377 --> 13:32.413
So, I saw this game

13:32.446 --> 13:35.149
with a great idea.

13:38.252 --> 13:41.989
But, this great idea of a game,

13:42.022 --> 13:44.224
when I looked
more closely at it,

13:44.258 --> 13:45.593
something was off.

13:45.627 --> 13:48.896
Murder, bury, and win.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.598
There was something missing.

13:50.632 --> 13:53.133
But, if these young men
knew how to fix the problems,

13:53.167 --> 13:54.968
they could take their game
directly to

13:55.002 --> 13:58.138
Milton fucking Bradley himself
and get signed on the spot.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.575
But, they couldn't fix it.

14:00.608 --> 14:02.610
I saw these scoundrels,

14:02.644 --> 14:04.612
and I said to myself,

14:04.646 --> 14:06.213
"Hey,

14:06.246 --> 14:08.916
how can I monetize this?"

14:08.949 --> 14:12.486
So, I lured them out
into the forest,

14:12.520 --> 14:15.155
and convinced them
to bring their game with them,

14:15.189 --> 14:17.358
knowing they had
nowhere else to turn

14:17.391 --> 14:20.127
and hadn't told
a single person about me.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.496
I welcome them into my home,

14:22.530 --> 14:25.199
- and got 'em.
- Hold up, back the fuck up.

14:27.101 --> 14:28.936
Motive.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.407
Motive, guys.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.678
Your game is missing
some basic elements,

14:36.711 --> 14:38.513
and that's just one of them.

14:38.546 --> 14:40.381
You can't kill someone
without a motive.

14:40.414 --> 14:43.917
That's just sociopathic,

14:43.951 --> 14:45.520
and mean.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.959
Wait, so that,
what you just did,

14:51.992 --> 14:54.495
was all an act?

14:54.529 --> 14:56.564
The game is good.

14:56.598 --> 14:59.534
Like I said,
it needs a little work.

14:59.567 --> 15:02.403
It's missing a certain
je ne sais quoi.

15:02.436 --> 15:04.138
- I wanna fix it.
- Well, sir,

15:04.171 --> 15:06.974
with all due respect,
why should we trust you?

15:11.378 --> 15:13.981
Adam, I don't get paid
when I go home sick.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.983
- We need to go.
- What, why?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.519
- He said he wants to murder us.
- Oh, to be fair,

15:17.552 --> 15:19.019
- that was an act.
- He put a bear trap

15:19.052 --> 15:20.688
- in your fucking face.
- I talk about bear traps

15:20.722 --> 15:22.055
- in the video.
- You can't fucking...

15:26.260 --> 15:27.995
Shut up.

15:49.450 --> 15:52.119
No fucking way, wait,
how did you get this?

15:52.152 --> 15:56.290
This is the very first edition
of Murder Wall.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.392
Do you know how rare this is?

15:58.425 --> 16:01.529
I mean, there wasn't even
a chandelier in this version.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.333
Take all the time you need.

16:51.579 --> 16:54.616
Ah, shit.

16:54.649 --> 16:57.317
You're V.V. Stubbs?

16:57.351 --> 17:00.755
You made Murder Wall...
that is the Murder Wall.

17:00.788 --> 17:03.056
That's real... that...
no, no, no, no, no,

17:03.090 --> 17:06.126
no, no, no, that's the...
wait, board game of the year.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.496
You're... you're
Victor Von fucking Stubbs!

17:09.531 --> 17:11.465
Oh, my God, dude!

17:13.166 --> 17:16.270
From Steal the Corpse to, uh,

17:16.303 --> 17:18.305
Mummy Picnic, to Apex,

17:18.338 --> 17:20.608
to Hangman's Noose,
Penguin Conquest,

17:20.642 --> 17:22.376
Monkey Panic.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.278
- Killer Trees!
- Killer Trees, oh, shit!

17:24.311 --> 17:26.280
This is
Victor Von fucking Stubbs!

17:29.316 --> 17:31.351
You know a lot about me.

17:31.385 --> 17:34.254
Oh, I know your career
inside and out.

17:34.288 --> 17:36.591
Sir,

17:36.624 --> 17:39.226
it is an honor.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.328
You look a lot younger
than I imagined.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.598
I assume you're vegan?

17:43.631 --> 17:45.633
Pescatarian, actually.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.401
Well, thank you, I do well
not getting my face

17:47.434 --> 17:48.670
all over the internet.

17:50.772 --> 17:52.540
You guys okay?

17:52.574 --> 17:54.709
- We're so much better now.
- Yeah, yeah, I wasn't scared.

17:54.742 --> 17:57.545
- No.
- Listen,

17:57.579 --> 17:59.479
I know how hard
you must've worked on this,

17:59.514 --> 18:01.549
and how painful
it must've been when everyone,

18:01.583 --> 18:04.719
and I do mean everyone,
turned their backs on you.

18:04.752 --> 18:08.121
I know what it's like
to see greatness stifled.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.791
But, fear not,

18:09.824 --> 18:11.593
I see you.

18:11.626 --> 18:13.427
I get you.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.229
And I think I know
where your game went wrong.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.365
Please allow me,

18:18.398 --> 18:21.401
Victor Von fucking Stubbs,

18:21.435 --> 18:25.339
the honor of assessing
the playability

18:25.372 --> 18:28.442
of Murder, Bury, Win.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.180
Ohh!

18:33.213 --> 18:35.282
Oh, shit!

18:35.315 --> 18:38.620
Oh, this cannot be real,
this is so crazy.

18:38.653 --> 18:40.487
Yeah!

18:40.521 --> 18:43.758
Okay, so I put the Murder deck
and the Bury deck upside down

18:43.791 --> 18:45.860
on the... where?

18:45.893 --> 18:49.530
There's no dedicated space
on the board to house the cards?

18:49.564 --> 18:53.935
That's fine, they look great
on my custom-made table.

18:53.968 --> 18:56.804
Now, Unforeseen Circumstances,

18:56.838 --> 19:00.474
the events that will
get in the way of our murder.

19:00.508 --> 19:04.277
These standby also on my table

19:04.311 --> 19:07.280
in the event that we land
on the appropriate space.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.416
- What's next?
- Motive.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.218
Maybe it makes sense
to put it here.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.688
There ya go, now we're thinking.

19:24.666 --> 19:28.301
And, Mr. Stubbs,
if you don't mind, sir.

19:31.639 --> 19:33.808
Motive:

19:33.841 --> 19:34.942
He has a lot of money.

19:37.411 --> 19:39.981
Motive: He abuses his power.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.418
Motive:

19:44.451 --> 19:46.888
He's standing
in the way of my dreams.

19:48.623 --> 19:49.891
Sounds like he'd be
your father, right?

19:53.895 --> 19:55.763
Next, we draw three Murder cards

19:55.797 --> 19:57.532
and three Bury cards,

19:57.565 --> 20:01.468
then dispose of the two
Bury cards that we don't want.

20:01.502 --> 20:04.371
So, just out of curiosity,

20:04.404 --> 20:06.373
which cards did you dispose of?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.875
"Hide it in a coffin,"

20:07.909 --> 20:10.678
and "Meat grinder."

20:10.712 --> 20:14.481
"Feed to dogs," and "Eat it."

20:14.515 --> 20:17.952
- Good.
- "Encased in cement."

20:17.985 --> 20:20.021
"Melted."

20:20.054 --> 20:22.355
Why not "Melted"?

20:22.389 --> 20:26.527
There's not really any space on
the game board for that.

20:26.561 --> 20:28.295
I can only do it
in the junkyard.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.566
- It's not very practical.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

20:31.599 --> 20:34.434
You don't see the practicality
in melting a body?

20:34.468 --> 20:37.905
You can dissolve
a body anywhere.

20:37.939 --> 20:39.707
Guys.

20:45.613 --> 20:48.281
This is a container
of sodium hydroxide,

20:48.315 --> 20:51.318
lye, your typical
corrosive drain cleaner.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.653
A little bit of this
with a little bit of water,

20:52.687 --> 20:54.421
you can melt skin, bones,
and even teeth

20:54.454 --> 20:57.491
in a matter of a few hours,
two hours even, tops.

20:59.026 --> 21:01.896
What, are you looking it up?

21:01.929 --> 21:03.998
Barrett, put your phone away.

21:04.031 --> 21:05.767
Put it away.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.338
You guys are nerds.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.508
Trust me,
it's an incredibly useful way

21:13.541 --> 21:15.877
of disposing of bodies.

21:15.910 --> 21:18.813
Have you, uh...

21:18.846 --> 21:21.616
Have I what?

21:21.649 --> 21:22.917
Have I used lye?

21:22.950 --> 21:24.852
We're in the forest.

21:24.886 --> 21:26.319
Critters.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.355
Critters die around here.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.724
Sometimes you try
different means

21:29.757 --> 21:31.592
of disposing of them,
so they don't go on

21:31.626 --> 21:33.360
digging each other up,
otherwise you gotta

21:33.393 --> 21:34.929
dig a deep grave every time,
and who has time for that?

21:34.962 --> 21:37.865
Are we good? Good.

21:37.899 --> 21:40.001
Which card you keep?

21:40.034 --> 21:41.836
"Remove identifying features."

21:41.869 --> 21:43.470
Oh, okay,
so cut off the fingers,

21:43.504 --> 21:44.705
pull out the teeth.

21:44.739 --> 21:46.841
Does that sound
practical to you?

21:46.874 --> 21:48.943
- No.
- Exactly.

21:48.976 --> 21:51.779
Melting the body
is much simpler.

21:51.813 --> 21:53.614
Go on, you can switch cards.

21:53.648 --> 21:55.683
I'll allow it.

22:01.722 --> 22:03.024
Okay, guys.

22:05.026 --> 22:06.894
Let's put together our weapons

22:06.928 --> 22:09.564
to concoct the perfect murder.

23:48.863 --> 23:51.799
Bad news, Adam, a cop
has stumbled across the scene,

23:51.832 --> 23:53.901
he pulls out a gun,
and he shoots you dead.

23:55.770 --> 23:57.838
Uh, no, actually
I go to jail for five turns.

23:57.872 --> 23:59.006
I'm not actually dead.

24:00.875 --> 24:03.077
Okay, okay, we can end there.

24:03.110 --> 24:05.112
But, I haven't gotten a chance

24:05.146 --> 24:07.148
to kill the intended victim yet.

24:10.518 --> 24:12.853
Yeah, but we get the idea,
right?

24:12.887 --> 24:14.555
It's cyclical gameplay.

24:14.588 --> 24:16.190
You go round and round,
back and forth

24:16.223 --> 24:18.092
almost to the end,
back to the beginning,

24:18.125 --> 24:19.827
fuck him up,
he heals in the hospital,

24:19.860 --> 24:21.228
fuck him up,
he heals in the hospital,

24:21.262 --> 24:22.897
forever and ever
until you don't fuck up.

24:22.930 --> 24:25.533
It's kinda repetitive, isn't it?

24:25.566 --> 24:27.868
Yeah, we've been meaning to

24:27.902 --> 24:30.237
work on a few things.

24:30.271 --> 24:32.673
Oh, so you knew
it was unfinished?

24:32.707 --> 24:34.575
You put it online
before it was ready?

24:34.608 --> 24:36.143
No, don't answer that.

24:36.177 --> 24:37.778
When I was your age,
I made choices

24:37.812 --> 24:40.815
I wouldn't
necessarily make today.

24:40.848 --> 24:43.184
But, yeesh,
that's the game you made.

24:43.217 --> 24:45.152
It needs more than a little work
if you ask me.

24:47.955 --> 24:50.057
Well, sorry, guys.

24:50.091 --> 24:52.026
Wish we could go deeper today.

24:52.059 --> 24:54.829
Hey, don't look so down.

24:54.862 --> 24:57.865
Not bad, not bad for a first go.

24:57.898 --> 24:59.900
Well, sir, um,

24:59.934 --> 25:02.203
I think that if we could spend
a little more time together,

25:02.236 --> 25:05.573
- we could finish the game.
- I don't have time for this.

25:05.606 --> 25:07.274
Not today, I'm sorry.

25:07.308 --> 25:09.944
Or maybe we could
leave the game here with you

25:09.977 --> 25:12.279
and we could all come back.

25:12.313 --> 25:14.882
Mr. Stubbs,
I really admire your work.

25:14.915 --> 25:17.284
I mean, there's gotta be
another way we could do more,

25:17.318 --> 25:19.253
right?

25:21.822 --> 25:24.191
Hey.

25:24.225 --> 25:25.826
Wait a minute.

25:25.860 --> 25:27.695
Wait a minute.

25:27.728 --> 25:29.830
Just like that,

25:29.864 --> 25:32.633
a lightbulb appears overhead.

25:38.005 --> 25:39.607
It's crazy.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.976
It's impulsive.

25:42.009 --> 25:44.612
But I can't ignore
this feeling!

25:44.645 --> 25:46.881
What feeling?

25:46.914 --> 25:48.883
I knew there was a reason
I invited you.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.318
- What's that?
- Ah, I can't.

25:51.352 --> 25:54.155
- I shouldn't.
- Shouldn't what?

25:54.188 --> 25:57.858
Oh, fuck it,
I'm gonna make this right.

25:57.892 --> 26:00.094
I'm gonna make something
happen for you.

26:00.127 --> 26:02.063
I even have... wow, I even have

26:02.096 --> 26:04.665
all the paperwork in my room.

26:04.698 --> 26:07.001
I'm gonna publish your game.

26:08.636 --> 26:11.105
- With all of your original art.
- Oh, my God!

26:11.138 --> 26:13.974
And all of the chills intact.

26:14.008 --> 26:15.776
Fuck yes.

26:15.810 --> 26:17.278
Once we get the kinks worked out
and I find that

26:17.311 --> 26:19.847
big missing piece,
I think it'll be successful.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.249
Here's what we're gonna do:
You're gonna sign some papers

26:22.283 --> 26:24.718
and I'm gonna pay you
a generous amount

26:24.752 --> 26:26.253
in cash today.

26:26.287 --> 26:28.823
Fuck yes!

26:30.958 --> 26:32.993
- Are you in?
- I'm in!

26:33.027 --> 26:35.262
- Are you in?
- I'm in!

26:35.296 --> 26:37.731
- Are you in?
- I'm in!

26:40.034 --> 26:41.969
Now, all you have to do

26:42.002 --> 26:44.105
is sign,

26:44.138 --> 26:45.940
and then print your name
on the dotted line,

26:45.973 --> 26:47.741
highlight it in yellow,
after that,

26:47.775 --> 26:49.844
you'll initial to the last page.

26:49.877 --> 26:52.346
Once you sign,
until you see Murder, Bury, Win

26:52.379 --> 26:54.281
on the shelves
of your local game store,

26:54.315 --> 26:56.383
you have never even heard of it.

26:58.886 --> 27:00.421
So, when can we start
telling people

27:00.454 --> 27:02.423
- that we're working with you?
- Just sign, abide by

27:02.456 --> 27:04.959
the legally binding document,
and you'll be okay.

27:04.992 --> 27:07.194
Oh, the next document
is confirmation of cash payment,

27:07.228 --> 27:10.030
once you get the cash,
you sign that, we're done.

27:10.064 --> 27:14.335
Okay, cool, and then...?

27:14.368 --> 27:17.972
And then, you go home
and make another game,

27:18.005 --> 27:20.741
if you want,
maybe it'll do better.

27:20.774 --> 27:22.776
Might even get some people
to fund it next time.

27:24.478 --> 27:26.714
What about Murder, Bury, Win?

27:26.747 --> 27:28.782
Uh, well, jeez, Chris,

27:28.816 --> 27:30.718
I really don't know
how to say this,

27:30.751 --> 27:32.419
technically,
once you buy something,

27:32.453 --> 27:35.356
it no longer belongs
to the store.

27:35.389 --> 27:38.392
Wait, but I thought
we were working with you.

27:38.425 --> 27:41.195
Sure, you are,
you're my three bright,

27:41.228 --> 27:43.264
brilliant, ambitious

27:43.297 --> 27:45.699
game testers.

27:45.733 --> 27:48.169
Game testers?

27:48.202 --> 27:49.770
Sir,

27:49.803 --> 27:52.339
we made this game.

27:52.373 --> 27:54.875
My name's got to be on the box.

27:54.909 --> 27:58.112
And I'll put you on the website
as a game tester.

27:58.145 --> 27:59.847
I poured my soul into this.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.316
You too?

28:02.349 --> 28:05.753
Listen, boys,

28:05.786 --> 28:08.289
- I hear you.
- Do you?

28:08.322 --> 28:10.057
Yeah.

28:10.090 --> 28:11.892
You know what,
you guys should just go.

28:11.926 --> 28:13.360
Now, pack it in,
have a nice day.

28:13.394 --> 28:14.828
I mean, but what about the game?

28:14.862 --> 28:17.198
The game?

28:17.231 --> 28:18.799
I don't need the game.

28:22.169 --> 28:23.938
How much money were you
willing to buy this for?

28:23.971 --> 28:25.439
- Adam!
- What?

28:25.472 --> 28:27.741
We can just make another game.

28:27.775 --> 28:29.810
$3,000, cash.

28:29.843 --> 28:31.478
Oh, fuck.

28:31.513 --> 28:32.947
Not bad, right?

28:32.980 --> 28:35.049
Fuck yes.

28:35.082 --> 28:38.852
Guys, absolutely,
$3,000 cash today

28:38.886 --> 28:40.788
for each of us.

28:40.821 --> 28:44.091
You gotta admit,
that is a good fucking deal.

28:44.124 --> 28:46.126
- To split.
- What the fuck, man?

28:46.160 --> 28:48.429
- I am insulted.
- Yeah, we ran our campaign

28:48.462 --> 28:50.164
for $3,500.

28:50.197 --> 28:51.398
He's trying to shortchange us.

28:51.432 --> 28:53.167
Yeah, that seems a little low.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.169
Shit, Puppies on Fire made
like $10 million on their...

28:55.202 --> 28:57.905
Don't fucking talk to me
about Puppies on Fire.

28:57.938 --> 28:59.406
Nobody saw that coming.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.176
Not even me.

29:02.209 --> 29:04.778
That campaign should not
have done as well as it did.

29:04.812 --> 29:08.482
Now, there's an entire industry
of wannabes to sift through.

29:08.516 --> 29:11.952
Rabbits on the Toilet,
Kangaroos Versus Ninjas,

29:11.986 --> 29:13.921
Hangnail Hangover, heard of 'em?

29:13.954 --> 29:15.789
Of course you haven't,
because for every

29:15.823 --> 29:17.525
Puppies on Fire
that strikes it big

29:17.559 --> 29:20.394
there were 10,000 campaigns
that failed!

29:20.427 --> 29:22.963
You should be grateful
you got anything at all.

29:22.997 --> 29:25.399
- Come on, guys, let's go.
- Go on.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.201
Run your fucking campaign again.

29:27.234 --> 29:28.902
You're not gonna
make any more money

29:28.936 --> 29:31.238
than you did last time,
I can tell you that much,

29:31.272 --> 29:33.541
or at least you're not gonna
make as much as the money

29:33.575 --> 29:36.143
that Barrett put in himself.

29:36.176 --> 29:38.812
Why would you say that?

29:38.846 --> 29:41.415
Because not a single person
actually donated

29:41.448 --> 29:43.350
- to your campaign.
- We had five donors.

29:43.384 --> 29:46.453
Yeah, and they all came from
your friggin' credit card,

29:46.487 --> 29:49.089
Mr. Anonymous.

29:49.123 --> 29:50.991
You guys think you could
slip one past me?

29:51.025 --> 29:54.228
You think you could
swindle an old man?

29:54.261 --> 29:56.830
Oh.

29:56.864 --> 29:58.232
What, what, you...

29:58.265 --> 29:59.967
you guys didn't know?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.435
How the fuck
would you know that?

30:01.468 --> 30:03.871
I got a great read on scammers.

30:03.904 --> 30:06.608
Why would you put money
into our own campaign?

30:06.641 --> 30:09.511
Well, there is literally
no reason for not signing now.

30:13.113 --> 30:15.916
The takeaway here is that
literally no one believed in you

30:15.949 --> 30:18.986
or your ideas, but I did.

30:19.019 --> 30:21.221
I'm here to help,
just sign the papers.

30:21.255 --> 30:22.489
Look, your friends are going to.

30:22.524 --> 30:24.191
No.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.562
You're crushing their dreams.

30:27.595 --> 30:29.496
Sign the paper, Barrett.

30:32.433 --> 30:35.102
Hey, are you gonna fuck this up?

30:44.044 --> 30:46.246
How did Mr. Stubbs know
that it was me

30:46.280 --> 30:48.082
who was contributing
to the campaign?

30:48.115 --> 30:50.552
- Answer me that, guys.
- Can you guys pin him down

30:50.585 --> 30:52.953
- or something?
- Pin me down?

30:52.986 --> 30:55.289
Not one person thought
our idea was any good,

30:55.322 --> 30:57.958
then the guy who created
all the games we love

30:57.991 --> 31:00.562
comes along and wants
to take our idea for his own.

31:00.595 --> 31:01.696
Ha, yeah, I've seen this shit.

31:01.730 --> 31:04.898
He's just stealing off the backs
of people of color.

31:04.932 --> 31:06.467
Oh, okay.

31:08.435 --> 31:10.237
I'm white.

31:10.270 --> 31:12.072
Adam, you just come up with

31:12.106 --> 31:13.974
sick, twisted shit
from the bowels of your mind.

31:14.007 --> 31:15.610
Chris and I
do all the hard work.

31:15.643 --> 31:17.144
Art is hard, V.V.,

31:17.177 --> 31:18.613
and I'm not gonna
be shortchanged!

31:18.646 --> 31:20.381
- Just sign the fucking paper.
- This is some sick

31:20.414 --> 31:23.518
- colonial bullshit.
- Give me my fucking game!

31:23.551 --> 31:25.319
- No, no!
- Give it to me!

31:25.352 --> 31:28.556
No, absolutely not!

31:30.290 --> 31:31.492
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

31:41.101 --> 31:45.005
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, oh, oh, God, oh!

31:45.038 --> 31:46.473
- Oh, my God.
- Barrett, is he okay?

31:46.508 --> 31:47.975
Oh!

31:50.277 --> 31:52.346
- Ugh!
- Fuck!

31:52.379 --> 31:54.948
Fuck, fuck, fuck, dude!

31:54.982 --> 31:56.684
Ah, he's bleeding out!

31:56.718 --> 32:00.220
Okay, maybe he'll be fine,
we just gotta get him some help.

32:00.254 --> 32:02.389
No, no, definitely not.

32:02.423 --> 32:04.626
- Are we sure?
- No, no, with a crushed skull

32:04.659 --> 32:06.193
like that,
he is 100 percent dead.

32:06.226 --> 32:08.095
Then what should we do?

32:08.128 --> 32:10.998
- Call the cops!
- Oh, okay, okay.

32:11.031 --> 32:12.132
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah, okay.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.168
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

32:14.201 --> 32:16.437
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

32:16.470 --> 32:18.972
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:19.006 --> 32:21.208
Okay.

33:27.609 --> 33:30.444
- We can't go to the cops.
- And why the fuck not?

33:30.477 --> 33:32.412
- 'Cause we murdered him.
- What, Adam, don't...

33:32.446 --> 33:34.649
Ooh, don't...
how could you say that?

33:34.682 --> 33:36.651
Have you looked at your
internet search history lately?

33:36.684 --> 33:38.151
No, why?

34:07.281 --> 34:08.650
- Who's that?
- Who do you think?

34:08.683 --> 34:10.417
It's the fucking cops.

34:10.450 --> 34:14.154
Don't... to everyone else
in the world, we murdered him.

34:14.187 --> 34:16.323
No, V.V. Stubbs invited us over.

34:16.356 --> 34:17.792
- Exactly.
- From an anonymous number.

34:17.825 --> 34:20.227
- He wanted our silence.
- He wanted our game.

34:20.260 --> 34:22.229
The contracts, the NDAs.

34:22.262 --> 34:24.164
- Anybody can make a contract.
- Guys, it doesn't even matter,

34:24.197 --> 34:25.432
okay? All I have to do
is just call the cops

34:25.465 --> 34:26.601
and explain to them
what's going on.

34:26.634 --> 34:28.335
You don't have a fucking record.

34:28.368 --> 34:29.671
You don't think I have
any reason to be scared, Adam?

34:29.704 --> 34:31.104
- How so?
- You don't fucking get it,

34:31.138 --> 34:33.140
- do you?
- You think I don't get it?

34:33.173 --> 34:36.376
No, you definitely don't get it.

34:36.410 --> 34:38.412
- Give me my phone.
- Make me.

34:38.445 --> 34:42.149
Guys, listen, we're making
a game about murder.

34:42.182 --> 34:44.619
This can all make sense if we're
just extra clear about it.

34:44.652 --> 34:46.554
And the part where Barrett
led a wild goose chase

34:46.588 --> 34:48.488
- around his place.
- Who's coming at me?

34:48.523 --> 34:50.457
Hm, sounds like
a motive to murder to me.

34:50.490 --> 34:55.262
Adam, nobody has anything
to gain by killing Mr. Stubbs!

34:55.295 --> 34:56.731
He was my hero, for fucks' sake.

34:56.764 --> 34:59.366
Now, can we just call the cops?

35:01.703 --> 35:03.771
Okay.

35:03.805 --> 35:05.740
So, he just died in a bear trap?

35:05.773 --> 35:07.875
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's how it fucking happened.

35:07.909 --> 35:09.510
Well, my fingerprints
are all over

35:09.544 --> 35:11.278
- that fucking thing, Chris!
- But, that's just

35:11.311 --> 35:14.481
such a ridiculous way
to murder someone.

35:14.515 --> 35:16.718
Look, no one would think that...

35:16.751 --> 35:18.786
Look, Adam, can you just
sit still, please?

35:24.224 --> 35:26.226
Bear trap.

35:28.362 --> 35:30.397
It is a card in a game.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.634
Nobody cares
about the game, Adam!

35:32.667 --> 35:35.903
That game is the only excuse
we have for being here.

35:35.937 --> 35:38.539
You think they're not gonna care
about a game that includes

35:38.573 --> 35:42.442
explicitly murdering someone
with a bear trap?

35:42.476 --> 35:46.179
With the only motives being,
"He has a lot of money,"

35:46.213 --> 35:48.181
"He abuses his power,"

35:48.215 --> 35:52.419
and "He's standing
in the way of my dreams."

35:52.452 --> 35:54.622
Throw them away!

35:54.656 --> 35:57.391
- You mean hide the evidence?
- What evidence?

35:57.424 --> 35:58.826
We didn't kill anybody!

35:58.860 --> 36:00.895
What about my fingerprints?

36:00.928 --> 36:03.430
- Just wipe 'em off!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:06.934 --> 36:09.436
Everybody can see us.

36:09.469 --> 36:11.539
Oh, please, come on,
we're in the middle of the woods

36:11.572 --> 36:13.240
with no one else around us.

36:13.273 --> 36:14.676
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

36:14.709 --> 36:16.243
We have to dispose of the body.

36:16.276 --> 36:18.378
No, put Mr. Stubbs down!

36:37.865 --> 36:41.703
Adam, what the hell's
the matter with you?

36:41.736 --> 36:44.572
I get it, now is not the time

36:44.605 --> 36:47.575
to be impulsive.

36:47.608 --> 36:49.476
We'll be fine,
it's not too late.

36:49.510 --> 36:51.979
All we have to do is take
the body back to where it was

36:52.013 --> 36:54.882
- and remove the prints.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:54.916 --> 36:56.751
He's staying right here,
we're not taking him

36:56.784 --> 36:58.986
- anywhere else.
- Why is he in the bathroom?

36:59.020 --> 37:01.723
There is so much blood.

37:03.490 --> 37:05.258
We tried to help him.

37:06.861 --> 37:09.296
We tried to help him.

37:09.329 --> 37:11.566
All right, all right, look,
let's just back away

37:11.599 --> 37:13.735
from Mr. Stubbs for a moment.

37:13.768 --> 37:15.837
All right, Adam,
Adam, come on.

37:15.870 --> 37:17.905
Step away from Mr. Stubbs,
come on.

37:29.717 --> 37:32.319
Guys, guys, sit down.

37:32.352 --> 37:33.855
Please.

37:50.738 --> 37:53.340
We're experts in murder.

37:53.373 --> 37:56.744
We made a game about it.

37:56.778 --> 38:00.548
Now is not the time
to play our game.

38:00.581 --> 38:02.650
Look,

38:02.683 --> 38:03.818
nobody knows we're here.

38:06.087 --> 38:09.891
V.V. Stubbs made sure
to keep us a secret.

38:09.924 --> 38:12.960
Now, somewhere in this house

38:12.994 --> 38:15.763
is $3,000 meant for
the three of us.

38:15.797 --> 38:18.498
He's dead,
he doesn't need it anymore.

38:19.901 --> 38:22.570
Even if, somehow,

38:22.603 --> 38:24.639
they believe what we tell them...

38:24.672 --> 38:27.374
- Which would be the truth.
- Even if.

38:29.043 --> 38:31.411
What then?

38:31.444 --> 38:33.648
Chris, do you think
Milton Bradley

38:33.681 --> 38:36.083
is gonna contact you

38:36.117 --> 38:37.885
and ask you
what you're working on?

38:40.788 --> 38:43.658
I guarantee you,
if we go to the cops,

38:43.691 --> 38:45.560
from this day forward,
we will be known

38:45.593 --> 38:47.494
as the three guys
that caused the death

38:47.528 --> 38:49.530
of the great
indie board game creator

38:49.564 --> 38:52.700
Mr. V.V. fucking Stubbs.

38:52.733 --> 38:55.002
Your dreams,

38:55.036 --> 38:56.504
they're gone.

38:58.673 --> 39:00.641
No one will wanna work with you,

39:00.675 --> 39:03.644
let alone put your name
on a board game.

39:03.678 --> 39:05.847
And me,

39:05.880 --> 39:08.649
add it to the list of reasons
as to why I'm unemployable.

39:12.019 --> 39:15.957
Barrett, you can talk about
the truth all you like,

39:15.990 --> 39:18.759
but you know just as much
as either one of us do

39:18.793 --> 39:22.129
just how insane this looks.

39:22.163 --> 39:25.867
Now, we will probably be
so broken up from the fallout

39:25.900 --> 39:27.969
that we will go
our separate ways.

39:30.805 --> 39:34.075
Well, at least tell me this:

39:34.108 --> 39:36.844
If we tell the truth,

39:36.878 --> 39:40.480
do you like what your life
looks like after today?

39:48.956 --> 39:51.491
Pick a card.

39:56.931 --> 39:58.132
What's it say?

40:02.503 --> 40:04.471
"Encase in cement."

40:04.505 --> 40:06.207
Do you know how to do that?

40:08.475 --> 40:10.778
- No.
- Barrett?

40:15.583 --> 40:17.518
Pick another.

40:25.026 --> 40:27.161
"Feed to wild boars."

40:29.096 --> 40:31.498
Not very practical.

40:43.878 --> 40:46.747
"Remove
the identifying features."

40:46.781 --> 40:49.884
Remove the identifying features.

40:52.853 --> 40:54.588
Like I said,

40:54.622 --> 40:57.758
we wrote the game on murder,

40:57.792 --> 40:59.794
and we can probably win

40:59.827 --> 41:03.764
if we play our cards right.

41:07.201 --> 41:10.004
I need some air.

41:14.809 --> 41:16.777
Sit still, please.

41:26.654 --> 41:28.222
All right, look,
people do stuff like this

41:28.255 --> 41:29.924
when they're overwhelmed.

41:29.957 --> 41:33.160
We tend to make stupid choices
in crazy situations.

41:33.194 --> 41:36.697
- I don't.
- Well, we gotta calm him down,

41:36.731 --> 41:37.999
comfort him or something,
because things

41:38.032 --> 41:41.035
are getting way out of hand.

41:41.068 --> 41:43.604
I mean, what... what's
something that Adam likes?

41:43.637 --> 41:46.173
I don't know, violence.

41:46.207 --> 41:48.275
Okay, what else does he like?

41:48.309 --> 41:50.745
Uh, coddling,
indulging his bullshit.

41:50.778 --> 41:52.079
Are you gonna be helpful or not?

41:52.113 --> 41:53.781
Fine, I'm sorry.

41:53.814 --> 41:55.916
Hey, with all that love
that's inside of you,

41:55.950 --> 41:58.052
all that goodness
that makes you you,

41:58.085 --> 41:59.920
I need that.

41:59.954 --> 42:01.922
All right, and I know
you think that Adam

42:01.956 --> 42:04.792
is just only my friend,
but trust me,

42:04.825 --> 42:07.695
he needs you, too,
especially right now.

42:07.728 --> 42:09.830
- Okay, I'll be nice.
- Just relax, just be nice.

42:09.864 --> 42:13.034
- I'll be nice, I'll be nice.
- He's more sensitive than you.

42:13.067 --> 42:14.168
- All right?
- Ahh!

42:15.836 --> 42:17.838
What was that?

42:17.872 --> 42:19.073
I don't know.

42:20.841 --> 42:22.710
Holy fuck! What the fuck?

42:24.612 --> 42:26.113
Oh!

42:26.147 --> 42:29.717
You fucking lunatic!

42:29.750 --> 42:32.586
I knew he was crazy,
but not this fucking crazy!

42:32.620 --> 42:34.989
Well, what's the point
in doing all this planning

42:35.022 --> 42:36.257
if we're not gonna
actually use it?

42:36.290 --> 42:39.727
That's a real person, Adam!

42:39.760 --> 42:41.195
It's not a real person anymore.

42:41.228 --> 42:43.664
You think he's got an opinion
about all this?

42:43.697 --> 42:46.033
Hey, Stubbs, Stubbs,
you got a take on all this?

42:46.067 --> 42:47.601
Oh, you don't,
because you're dead?

42:47.635 --> 42:49.070
He's dead, guys.

42:49.103 --> 42:51.072
Okay, we'll cut him up
and spread the body parts.

42:51.105 --> 42:52.940
Oh, oh, where?

42:52.973 --> 42:55.142
Wherever, did you forget
that we're in the middle

42:55.176 --> 42:57.645
of the fucking woods
with nobody else around us.

42:57.678 --> 42:59.246
We can fix this, okay, guys?

42:59.280 --> 43:00.748
Everything will be fine.

43:00.781 --> 43:03.350
Adam, you know not what you do.

43:03.384 --> 43:06.020
The fuck?

43:06.053 --> 43:08.956
Actually, fuck being nice.

43:08.989 --> 43:11.625
Now, what in the fuck
is this, hm?

43:11.659 --> 43:13.260
What do you call this shit?

43:13.294 --> 43:17.131
This officially looks like
cold-blooded murder!

43:17.164 --> 43:20.000
We can't go to the police now,
nah, not after this shit!

43:20.034 --> 43:21.936
Oh, no, hell no!

43:32.446 --> 43:33.848
What was that sound?

43:43.090 --> 43:45.659
It's the cops.

43:45.693 --> 43:47.161
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

43:47.194 --> 43:49.130
What do we do, what do we do?

43:49.163 --> 43:51.265
Shut the fuck up.

44:39.446 --> 44:41.282
Hey.

44:41.315 --> 44:43.050
Hi.

44:43.083 --> 44:44.318
How's it going?

44:44.351 --> 44:46.487
We got a 911 call
from this address.

44:46.521 --> 44:49.823
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you sure did.

44:49.857 --> 44:51.892
What's going on?

44:51.926 --> 44:54.962
Yeah, you know what,
funny story.

44:54.995 --> 44:57.131
I ended up cutting myself
pretty good

44:57.164 --> 44:58.966
and just got into
a panic over it

44:58.999 --> 45:01.402
and freaked out a little bit,

45:01.435 --> 45:04.471
but I got it under control.

45:04.506 --> 45:08.142
But I thought I hung up
before it reached the tone.

45:08.175 --> 45:10.911
That is a lot of blood.

45:10.945 --> 45:14.782
Yeah, but it's cool,
it's cool, I got it.

45:14.815 --> 45:16.317
Did I get your name?

45:16.350 --> 45:18.886
Oh, God.

45:18.919 --> 45:20.921
Chris.

45:20.955 --> 45:22.223
Chris?

45:22.256 --> 45:23.791
Chris what?

45:23.824 --> 45:25.259
Christopher, actually.

45:25.292 --> 45:26.827
Christopher actually.

45:31.265 --> 45:32.833
10-1, I do not read you.

45:32.866 --> 45:34.368
Repeat, 10-1, I do not read.

45:36.837 --> 45:38.405
I'm gonna take a look inside.

45:41.242 --> 45:42.910
Sure, of course.

46:06.967 --> 46:10.137
You have nunchucks,
axes, guns, and knives.

46:10.170 --> 46:12.106
- Please explain.
- You mean the wall?

46:12.139 --> 46:16.511
- Sure, the wall.
- That's the Murder Wa... Wall.

46:16.544 --> 46:18.012
The Murder Wall.

46:18.045 --> 46:20.247
It's not literally used
for murdering.

46:20.281 --> 46:23.050
- Okay, explain.
- It's a replica,

46:23.083 --> 46:27.354
fairly expensive replica.

46:27.388 --> 46:29.890
From, from the game?

46:29.923 --> 46:31.492
Murder Wall,
you've never heard of it?

46:31.526 --> 46:33.827
It was pretty big, it was a hit.

46:33.861 --> 46:36.130
Uh, yeah.

46:36.163 --> 46:38.265
Barry, shut... shut your mouth.

46:38.299 --> 46:39.900
Your mouth, shut it.

46:39.933 --> 46:41.468
- Sit down.
- Okay, okay.

46:41.502 --> 46:42.336
Sit.

46:46.206 --> 46:48.375
I think I know you
from somewhere.

46:50.944 --> 46:53.013
The store in Willits, right,
the board game store.

46:53.047 --> 46:54.448
- What's the name of that store?
- No, no,

46:54.481 --> 46:57.017
that doesn't, that doesn't ring
a bell, mm-mm.

47:02.323 --> 47:05.225
10-1, 10-1, uh,

47:05.259 --> 47:07.394
I do not copy, 10-1.

47:07.428 --> 47:10.998
Oh my God.

47:11.031 --> 47:13.867
I do not understand, 10-1.

47:16.103 --> 47:19.873
Okay, sir, look, I'm just here
minding my business,

47:19.907 --> 47:21.275
just trying to work on my game.

47:21.308 --> 47:24.078
That's all.

47:24.111 --> 47:27.481
Your game.

47:27.515 --> 47:29.049
Yeah.

47:32.453 --> 47:34.988
Oh...

47:35.022 --> 47:37.525
my God, oh my God.

47:40.227 --> 47:43.497
You're V.V. Stubbs?

47:43.531 --> 47:45.032
You're V.V. Stubbs, you're V....

47:45.065 --> 47:46.133
you're V.V. Stubbs.

47:46.166 --> 47:48.235
You're V.V. Stubbs.

47:50.003 --> 47:52.439
Okay, all right, you got me,
you busted me.

47:52.473 --> 47:54.642
I'm, I'm V.V. Stubbs, yeah.

47:54.676 --> 47:57.211
- Shh.
- Oh man!

47:57.244 --> 47:58.412
Oh, wow.

47:58.445 --> 48:00.914
I was gonna say you're the
best kept secret in town, but...

48:00.948 --> 48:03.484
Just blew my cover,
but yeah, you caught me.

48:03.518 --> 48:08.021
You know, I do like to get away
and this is a nice retreat.

48:08.055 --> 48:12.159
Yeah, too bad my face is just
plastered all over the internet.

48:12.192 --> 48:15.129
People just recognize me
left and right out there,

48:15.162 --> 48:19.133
and it's just too much, so,
you know, this place is...

48:19.166 --> 48:21.536
- Nice and quiet.
- Yeah.

48:21.569 --> 48:25.272
The woods, so you can focus.

48:25.305 --> 48:27.408
- Yeah.
- So, uh,

48:27.441 --> 48:31.078
where else are you based out of?

48:31.111 --> 48:34.281
Oh, you know,
just here and there.

48:34.314 --> 48:36.518
Yeah, you know.

48:36.551 --> 48:37.719
One place to another.

48:37.752 --> 48:42.557
God, you are so young, you're
so much younger than I...

48:42.590 --> 48:44.958
you are the youngest
entrepreneur

48:44.992 --> 48:46.393
I believe that I have ever met.

48:48.228 --> 48:51.432
Thank you, thank you,
I, I get that a lot.

48:51.465 --> 48:53.066
Wow, I am speechless.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.569
So you're working on a new game.

48:54.602 --> 48:57.271
Well, yeah.

48:57.304 --> 48:59.006
Don't tell me.

48:59.039 --> 49:02.042
Uh, wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

49:02.075 --> 49:03.444
Hey, hey, hey!

49:03.477 --> 49:04.712
What are you doing,
what are you doing?

49:04.746 --> 49:06.346
I'm looking at the game.

49:06.380 --> 49:08.081
No, don't, don't do that.

49:08.115 --> 49:09.651
It's not finished.

49:09.684 --> 49:10.984
Oh!

49:11.018 --> 49:13.220
Oh no, no, no, I'm so sorry!

49:13.253 --> 49:15.590
I've seen too much,
I won't look!

49:15.623 --> 49:18.091
Is it a new game,
can you tell me that much?

49:18.125 --> 49:19.594
It is a new game.

49:19.627 --> 49:21.128
That is correct.

49:21.161 --> 49:23.397
Am I the first person
that has seen it?

49:23.430 --> 49:26.099
First person in the whole world.

49:33.173 --> 49:36.210
I am just so, huh...

49:36.243 --> 49:39.012
Badge 63, break-in, respond.

49:47.287 --> 49:49.389
10-1, 10-1.

49:54.696 --> 49:56.230
This is so cool.

49:56.263 --> 49:59.066
Oh, uh, yeah, you must be a fan.

49:59.099 --> 50:02.504
Oh, I play Penguin Conquest
with my son all the time.

50:02.537 --> 50:03.671
- That's great.
- Yeah.

50:03.705 --> 50:05.472
We play other games too,
Monkey Panic,

50:05.507 --> 50:08.676
Apex, Columbus Strikes Again.

50:08.710 --> 50:12.479
- Cool.
- And Puppies on Fire.

50:12.514 --> 50:16.551
Not my game, that, that,
that's no V.V. Stubbs.

50:16.584 --> 50:19.253
Oh, I'm sorry.

50:19.286 --> 50:22.590
It was so popular,
I figured it was yours.

50:22.624 --> 50:24.324
No, it's fine.

50:24.358 --> 50:28.328
It's a simple game, but my boy,
he sure does love it.

50:28.362 --> 50:30.197
Sometimes I let him win
just because

50:30.230 --> 50:32.266
I love seeing him
get so excited.

50:32.299 --> 50:34.268
I mean, when my puppy
catches up in flames,

50:34.301 --> 50:38.171
I love seeing his eyes
just light up.

50:38.205 --> 50:39.373
Mm.

50:39.406 --> 50:41.643
My boy and I, we were having
a lot of trouble communicating.

50:41.676 --> 50:45.445
We weren't talking
very much and, uh,

50:45.479 --> 50:47.515
then he brought
Penguin Conquest home

50:47.549 --> 50:48.816
and it really...

50:50.752 --> 50:53.521
There's something about games,
it just brings people together.

50:53.555 --> 50:55.455
- I don't know what it is.
- Ah, again.

50:57.424 --> 51:00.127
We've been through a lot
this year, little Jake and I.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.797
We don't have much going on
in our lives here,

51:02.830 --> 51:04.264
but when we play games together,

51:04.298 --> 51:05.833
it's like we can go
on an adventure.

51:05.867 --> 51:08.435
We fight the bad guys,
race to the finish,

51:08.468 --> 51:10.538
take over the world.

51:13.407 --> 51:16.811
Nowadays, games are the only way
I interact with my son anymore.

51:16.844 --> 51:20.414
We can sort of step away
from ourselves

51:20.447 --> 51:22.684
just for a little while.

51:22.717 --> 51:25.653
Escaping.

51:25.687 --> 51:28.188
Well...

51:28.221 --> 51:30.858
I don't think
that's escaping per se.

51:30.892 --> 51:32.694
I think that's more of a way

51:32.727 --> 51:36.764
to tap into who you are, right,

51:36.798 --> 51:40.868
and hone in on
your imagination.

51:40.902 --> 51:44.706
Some of the best games
connect us that way.

51:44.739 --> 51:46.440
Wow.

51:46.473 --> 51:49.209
Yeah, I mean,

51:49.242 --> 51:51.244
your games sure do.

51:53.848 --> 51:55.650
I don't like to be hyperbolic,

51:55.683 --> 51:59.821
but meeting you
has been really...

51:59.854 --> 52:01.756
I don't even, I don't even know
how to say it.

52:05.627 --> 52:10.698
What is that game store
in Willits?

52:10.732 --> 52:13.233
Your web is up.

52:13.266 --> 52:14.234
Let's check it out.

52:14.267 --> 52:17.204
Oh, wait, hold on.

52:17.237 --> 52:19.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

52:19.574 --> 52:21.208
Uh, sorry,

52:21.241 --> 52:24.912
I'm just really preoccupied
on the computer.

52:24.946 --> 52:27.682
I'm working on a lot of stuff
for the new game.

52:27.715 --> 52:29.416
It's top secret.

52:29.449 --> 52:32.219
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:32.252 --> 52:34.956
Yeah, so, it's...

52:34.989 --> 52:36.691
Just be careful.

52:36.724 --> 52:40.260
You do not wanna leave your
password lying around like that.

52:44.565 --> 52:46.668
Nice detective work.

52:46.701 --> 52:48.770
- Thank you.
- Good eye.

52:48.803 --> 52:50.705
Yeah, okay.

52:50.738 --> 52:52.472
Oh yeah, well,
I'll get out of your hair.

52:52.507 --> 52:56.376
I'm sure you have plenty to do.

52:56.410 --> 52:58.980
Nice meeting you, Officer...

52:59.013 --> 53:01.348
Everson,
but you can call me Dan.

53:01.381 --> 53:03.350
- Dan.
- And what should I call you?

53:03.383 --> 53:05.318
Chris or V.V.
or what are we going with?

53:05.352 --> 53:06.486
You can call me Stubbs,

53:06.521 --> 53:10.390
but that's between us.

53:10.424 --> 53:12.259
That's wonderful.

53:12.292 --> 53:14.261
Hey, you know what,
would you mind...

53:14.294 --> 53:15.930
I know you're very busy,
but would you mind

53:15.963 --> 53:17.330
getting a selfie with me?

53:17.364 --> 53:19.967
Just really quickly.

53:20.001 --> 53:21.536
Yeah.

53:21.569 --> 53:23.771
Sure, I can take it.

53:23.805 --> 53:27.474
He's taking a goddamn selfie.

53:27.508 --> 53:29.409
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill him.

53:29.443 --> 53:30.511
I'm going to kill him.

53:30.545 --> 53:31.546
No, no, no, no.

53:31.579 --> 53:33.881
No, no, okay.

53:33.915 --> 53:35.583
I'm gonna kill Chris.

53:35.616 --> 53:36.784
Can you hand me the machete?

53:36.818 --> 53:38.485
Get the fuck out.

53:38.519 --> 53:42.590
- Let me know when you're ready.
- I am ready.

53:42.623 --> 53:44.592
Uh, uh, where do I press?

53:44.625 --> 53:46.661
The camera button right there.

53:46.694 --> 53:48.696
- The red one.
- Oh, okay, okay.

53:51.431 --> 53:52.934
Just move your thumb down
and take it.

53:52.967 --> 53:55.002
Oh, I was trying to use
my pinky.

53:55.036 --> 53:58.405
I'm sorry.

53:58.438 --> 54:03.310
Ah, I'm sorry, I can't take it.

54:03.343 --> 54:06.714
It just... you know,
it just feels wrong

54:06.748 --> 54:09.851
to take a photo together when...

54:09.884 --> 54:12.687
Jake, Jake should be here.

54:14.454 --> 54:15.990
- Seriously?
- Yeah!

54:16.023 --> 54:18.693
Yeah, that way we can talk games

54:18.726 --> 54:21.495
and maybe play around a bit,

54:21.529 --> 54:23.664
take our new game for a spin.

54:23.698 --> 54:26.901
Wow, thank you,
he is going to be thrilled.

54:28.569 --> 54:31.939
Okay, that makes me very happy.

54:31.973 --> 54:33.674
Yeah, bring him by any time.

54:33.708 --> 54:36.409
Okay, will do.

54:36.443 --> 54:39.080
- Okay.
- Oh, uh, shit.

54:39.113 --> 54:40.815
He's with his mother
starting from tomorrow.

54:40.848 --> 54:43.416
I know this is a lot,
but would you mind terribly

54:43.450 --> 54:45.086
if I brought him by
after my shift today?

54:45.119 --> 54:48.089
We will not take long,
I promise you, I promise you.

54:48.122 --> 54:50.625
- I promise you.
- Sure.

54:50.658 --> 54:53.661
Sounds great.

54:53.694 --> 54:55.096
Thank you.

54:55.129 --> 54:57.532
- Thank you again.
- Yeah, yup.

55:01.102 --> 55:02.770
One last thing.

55:02.804 --> 55:06.406
Would you mind terribly,
if I brought them with me,

55:06.439 --> 55:09.342
could you sign a few
of his games for him?

55:09.376 --> 55:11.712
I'd love to.

55:11.746 --> 55:13.881
- Thank you again.
- Yeah, no prob...

55:13.915 --> 55:15.950
no problem.

55:15.983 --> 55:17.552
All right.

55:27.394 --> 55:29.429
Wait.

55:29.462 --> 55:31.833
Officer Dan!

55:31.866 --> 55:34.401
Stubbs.

55:34.434 --> 55:39.106
Hey, uh, what time
should I expect you?

55:39.140 --> 55:40.708
Uh, well...

55:40.741 --> 55:43.744
Badge 63, break-in, respond.

55:43.778 --> 55:45.746
Badge 63, 10-4.

55:45.780 --> 55:50.450
10-35, we've got a major crime
in progress.

55:50.483 --> 55:53.087
Yikes, uh, 10-4, copy that.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.589
What's that?

55:54.622 --> 55:55.723
What time?

55:55.756 --> 55:57.558
I have to pick up my son
in Ukiah,

55:57.592 --> 56:00.995
so maybe a few hours?

56:01.028 --> 56:03.865
See you then.

56:33.493 --> 56:35.630
Chris, what the fuck
are you doing?

56:35.663 --> 56:37.430
I'm looking up how far away
Ukiah is.

56:37.464 --> 56:38.699
We need to figure this out.

56:38.733 --> 56:39.934
What do you think I'm doing?

56:39.967 --> 56:40.835
Do you realize
what you've just done?

56:40.868 --> 56:42.603
Why the fuck would you
invite him back?

56:42.637 --> 56:44.205
He was about to take
a picture of my face.

56:44.238 --> 56:46.040
As a celebrity,
not as a suspect.

56:46.073 --> 56:48.441
- He recognized me.
- Well, I'm sure you've

56:48.475 --> 56:49.777
just gotten everything
you've ever wanted,

56:49.810 --> 56:51.045
haven't you, Chris?

56:51.078 --> 56:51.879
Hey, I was playing a role!

56:51.913 --> 56:53.748
I just pulled off
the performance

56:53.781 --> 56:56.017
of a fucking lifetime, I just
saved both of your asses.

56:56.050 --> 56:57.585
Well, it sounded to me
like you really enjoyed

56:57.618 --> 56:58.886
your time with your new fan.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.621
Well, in case
you don't remember,

57:00.655 --> 57:02.790
there's still blood
behind the damn chair, Adam.

57:02.823 --> 57:04.692
Well, it wouldn't be there if
Barry hadn't pushed Mr. Stubbs

57:04.725 --> 57:07.194
- into a fucking bear trap.
- I didn't shove him.

57:07.228 --> 57:09.163
He attacked me
and fell into it himself.

57:09.196 --> 57:10.731
Well, it's not like he had
a weapon in his hands

57:10.765 --> 57:11.766
- or anything...
- He told you guys

57:11.799 --> 57:13.100
- to pin me down!
- Well, I didn't do anything!

57:13.134 --> 57:14.101
You didn't do anything?

57:14.135 --> 57:15.136
You didn't?

57:15.169 --> 57:16.604
Who put this campaign online?

57:16.637 --> 57:17.470
You did.

57:17.505 --> 57:18.906
Who arranged for
this little meeting?

57:18.940 --> 57:19.774
You did.

57:19.807 --> 57:20.808
Who moved the body?

57:20.841 --> 57:21.676
You did!

57:21.709 --> 57:24.011
Who tied our hands
to fucking murder

57:24.045 --> 57:27.748
by cutting into
his fucking foot?

57:27.782 --> 57:28.983
You did.

57:29.016 --> 57:32.853
Every single step of the way,
it's only been about you.

57:32.887 --> 57:34.755
And now we're fucking trapped

57:34.789 --> 57:37.191
without any way
of turning back now

57:37.224 --> 57:42.029
all because you decided to do
everything without asking us.

57:42.063 --> 57:44.198
And who are you to lecture me
about honesty?

57:44.231 --> 57:45.833
Really?

57:45.866 --> 57:47.601
I put money into the campaign
because I wanted

57:47.635 --> 57:49.537
to encourage you two, I wanted
to make you feel better.

57:49.570 --> 57:52.039
Oh, wow, you're wrong, man,
dead wrong.

57:52.073 --> 57:55.109
Yeah, I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it, Barry.

57:55.142 --> 57:58.646
That did kinda
make me feel worse.

57:58.679 --> 58:01.682
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

58:01.716 --> 58:03.150
Wait, what is this?

58:03.184 --> 58:04.952
How did you get on to this?

58:04.986 --> 58:06.687
What do you mean?

58:12.259 --> 58:15.629
This is administrative access
to the Gamechanger site.

58:15.663 --> 58:17.198
How did you log on to this?

58:17.231 --> 58:19.633
He wrote down his password
right here.

58:23.804 --> 58:27.041
Holy fucking shit.

58:27.074 --> 58:27.942
What?

58:27.975 --> 58:31.846
I think V.V. Stubbs
owns Gamechanger.

58:33.714 --> 58:35.249
Our campaign never failed.

58:35.282 --> 58:37.918
He suppresses them.

58:37.952 --> 58:41.122
Our campaign
was never even seen.

58:41.155 --> 58:44.759
If there wasn't already
a motive to kill,

58:44.792 --> 58:46.327
there you go.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.330
Just like that, that fucker
endgames our careers.

58:57.338 --> 58:59.240
I think it's imperative
that the three of us

58:59.273 --> 59:03.010
are on the same page
as to what's the next move.

59:03.044 --> 59:06.947
Well, I wanna dispose of it.

59:06.981 --> 59:09.683
Okay, no surprise there.

59:09.717 --> 59:11.218
Fucking psychopath.

59:11.252 --> 59:14.221
But all things considered,
I'm okay with that.

59:14.255 --> 59:17.224
Barry?

59:17.258 --> 59:21.328
Um...

59:21.362 --> 59:24.298
Do you really think we can go
back after all of this?

59:30.137 --> 59:31.639
No.

59:34.275 --> 59:37.111
We can't go back.

59:37.144 --> 59:40.714
Well, I don't know
where to start.

59:44.819 --> 59:47.088
Well, like Adam said,

59:47.121 --> 59:50.157
we did make a game about
getting away with murder.

59:54.662 --> 59:56.363
Let's play it.

59:58.199 --> 1:00:00.968
Murder, Bury, Win.

1:00:01.001 --> 1:00:01.969
Part Two:

1:00:02.002 --> 1:00:05.206
The quick start guide
to disposing the body.

1:00:05.239 --> 1:00:06.273
The first rule.

1:00:06.307 --> 1:00:09.743
Clean every last drop of blood,

1:00:09.777 --> 1:00:12.012
because nothing gets in the way
of a perfect crime

1:00:12.046 --> 1:00:15.282
like leaving a bloody
foot trail behind.

1:00:15.316 --> 1:00:18.853
- This isn't working.
- Scrub harder then.

1:00:18.886 --> 1:00:20.721
It's not strong enough.

1:00:29.797 --> 1:00:31.132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

1:00:31.165 --> 1:00:32.700
- Stop that!
- Yeah, man,

1:00:32.733 --> 1:00:34.668
that shit's extremely corrosive.

1:00:40.074 --> 1:00:43.077
Now comes the tricky part.

1:00:43.110 --> 1:00:44.345
The second rule.

1:00:44.378 --> 1:00:46.714
Dispose of that body.

1:00:48.983 --> 1:00:50.284
You sure this is gonna work?

1:00:50.317 --> 1:00:51.952
Oh God, I hope so.

1:00:51.986 --> 1:00:54.722
Oh, it'll work.

1:01:01.896 --> 1:01:02.997
Third rule.

1:01:03.030 --> 1:01:04.832
Control your chaos.

1:01:04.865 --> 1:01:07.201
Murder can be messy,
so it's up to you

1:01:07.234 --> 1:01:09.770
to get rid of any loose threads.

1:01:15.075 --> 1:01:16.343
Fourth rule.

1:01:16.377 --> 1:01:19.280
Eliminate the trail
to the scene of the crime.

1:01:19.313 --> 1:01:21.182
Nothing can compromise
the perfect murder

1:01:21.215 --> 1:01:22.416
like a viral photo of you

1:01:22.449 --> 1:01:24.318
marching to the house
with an ax.

1:01:28.523 --> 1:01:31.725
Yes.

1:01:31.759 --> 1:01:35.095
All right.

1:01:35.129 --> 1:01:37.031
- Okay!
- What?

1:01:37.064 --> 1:01:39.366
Done, erased,
we have disappeared.

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:41.468
- And my credit card?
- What credit card?

1:01:41.502 --> 1:01:42.970
So impressed.

1:01:48.409 --> 1:01:50.411
And the fifth rule,

1:01:50.444 --> 1:01:53.814
"Work out your alibi
and do it yesterday."

1:01:53.847 --> 1:01:55.049
Ugh.

1:01:55.082 --> 1:01:58.319
We probably should've added
that one to the top of the list.

1:02:00.154 --> 1:02:01.523
Shit.

1:02:01.556 --> 1:02:04.225
Okay, the best alibis
are done in real time.

1:02:04.258 --> 1:02:06.894
The only thing that we can
confirm in real time

1:02:06.927 --> 1:02:08.963
is that Officer Dan saw Chris.

1:02:08.996 --> 1:02:11.131
Well, I went home sick, so...

1:02:11.165 --> 1:02:13.467
Well, I can vouch for you,
I don't have a job.

1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:15.903
So...

1:02:15.936 --> 1:02:19.773
Yeah, and you gotta quit
your job anyways.

1:02:19.807 --> 1:02:22.309
- I gotta quit my...
- Yes.

1:02:22.343 --> 1:02:25.045
- That's fucking bullshit, man.
- Yes, you have to quit your job.

1:02:25.079 --> 1:02:26.113
You heard what Officer Dan said,

1:02:26.146 --> 1:02:29.517
he could roll up at any minute
to the game store.

1:02:29.551 --> 1:02:32.486
You can never be seen again.

1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:34.855
Ever again.

1:02:34.888 --> 1:02:37.525
In the game store.

1:02:37.559 --> 1:02:41.128
How do I quit my job and lock
myself into an alibi?

1:02:43.531 --> 1:02:45.533
Squeeze together, we got this.

1:02:45.567 --> 1:02:47.368
We can do this.

1:02:47.401 --> 1:02:49.571
All right, here we go.

1:02:49.604 --> 1:02:51.405
Smile!

1:03:02.082 --> 1:03:06.353
You know forensic scientists can
tell if a photo is fake, right?

1:03:06.387 --> 1:03:07.622
Relax, okay?

1:03:07.656 --> 1:03:10.057
It looks great, they won't be
able to tell the difference

1:03:10.090 --> 1:03:12.826
between this one
and a fake one, you bozo.

1:03:14.895 --> 1:03:17.599
Sent.

1:03:17.632 --> 1:03:22.836
Receiving, receiving, receiving.

1:03:22.870 --> 1:03:24.506
Hold on.

1:03:24.539 --> 1:03:28.042
Oh, finally, okay.

1:03:28.075 --> 1:03:30.144
Whoa.

1:03:30.177 --> 1:03:32.614
Okay, uh,

1:03:32.647 --> 1:03:36.551
not what I had in mind, but,

1:03:36.584 --> 1:03:38.452
here we go.

1:03:42.456 --> 1:03:44.191
Fuck.

1:03:44.224 --> 1:03:46.994
What's wrong?

1:03:47.027 --> 1:03:49.229
I don't know how
I'm gonna quit my job.

1:03:49.263 --> 1:03:50.397
Well, I can help with that.

1:03:50.431 --> 1:03:53.067
I've quit more jobs than
you have teeth in your head.

1:03:55.637 --> 1:03:57.137
Yeah, sounds about right.

1:03:57.171 --> 1:03:58.472
Okay.

1:03:58.506 --> 1:04:00.107
Who are we writing to?

1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:01.342
Just draft it.

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:04.278
Well, I need some type
of context.

1:04:04.311 --> 1:04:07.314
It's to my boss, Alan.

1:04:11.352 --> 1:04:13.954
You think V.V. Stubbs, if he
hadn't shut down our campaign...

1:04:13.987 --> 1:04:16.323
That we would've been a success,
I mean, maybe.

1:04:16.357 --> 1:04:19.493
I'm kinda glad that everything
happened, all things considered.

1:04:19.527 --> 1:04:22.463
We would've mistaken that for
a false sense of validation,

1:04:22.496 --> 1:04:24.064
thinking that the game
was great.

1:04:24.098 --> 1:04:25.899
I mean, come on, look at it,
it's not...

1:04:25.933 --> 1:04:27.535
You didn't think
the game was great?

1:04:27.569 --> 1:04:29.903
Okay, well,

1:04:29.937 --> 1:04:31.305
I don't like it.

1:04:31.338 --> 1:04:34.341
Our game is just like
other games, man.

1:04:34.375 --> 1:04:36.511
Play to win, beat others,

1:04:36.544 --> 1:04:39.346
literally beat them
with a shovel.

1:04:39.380 --> 1:04:42.483
What's the whole point
of everybody competing?

1:04:46.153 --> 1:04:49.356
I mean, games are supposed
to be competitive.

1:04:49.390 --> 1:04:50.525
That's the whole point.

1:04:50.558 --> 1:04:53.595
What's the point in the point?

1:04:53.628 --> 1:04:55.963
So evidently,
you don't like confrontation.

1:04:55.996 --> 1:04:58.932
- I get that.
- No, you know me.

1:04:58.966 --> 1:05:01.402
I like collaboration.

1:05:01.435 --> 1:05:03.470
Hm, well, you know,

1:05:03.505 --> 1:05:07.341
I like disposing of bodies
with you guys.

1:05:07.374 --> 1:05:10.077
That's pretty collaborative.

1:05:12.112 --> 1:05:14.516
Wouldn't you say?

1:05:14.549 --> 1:05:16.016
No.

1:05:18.252 --> 1:05:20.522
It was a joke, man.

1:05:20.555 --> 1:05:23.691
Nah, nah, I hear you,
I hear you.

1:05:23.725 --> 1:05:25.693
Less competition.

1:05:25.727 --> 1:05:27.428
I can get behind that.

1:05:27.461 --> 1:05:29.196
Done.

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:30.665
All right, don't send it yet.

1:05:30.698 --> 1:05:32.667
Well, it's sending.

1:05:32.700 --> 1:05:35.068
- I said don't send it.
- What?

1:05:35.102 --> 1:05:37.971
Well, it's gonna get you fired.

1:05:38.005 --> 1:05:39.306
What did you say?

1:05:39.339 --> 1:05:41.308
I said, "Fuck you
fucking fuckheads

1:05:41.341 --> 1:05:43.377
and your stupid
fucking game store.

1:05:43.410 --> 1:05:44.679
4/20 for life."

1:05:44.712 --> 1:05:46.280
You said you were
gonna help me quit.

1:05:46.313 --> 1:05:47.414
What, I am!

1:05:47.448 --> 1:05:49.049
You're not seeing the benefits.

1:05:49.082 --> 1:05:51.452
Man, you get fired,
you get more perks.

1:05:51.485 --> 1:05:54.955
I want my game on the shelf
on good terms.

1:05:59.627 --> 1:06:02.362
Adam, you forgot
to crop the blood out.

1:06:02.396 --> 1:06:05.299
You forgot to crop
the blood out!

1:06:05.332 --> 1:06:07.167
Shit.

1:06:09.470 --> 1:06:11.004
Well, I can melt the shirt.

1:06:11.038 --> 1:06:12.607
Yeah, that's gonna fucking help.

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:14.074
Gimme that.

1:06:14.107 --> 1:06:16.009
Fuck.

1:06:16.043 --> 1:06:17.745
Fucking idiot.

1:06:17.779 --> 1:06:21.081
How do you forget
to crop out the blood?

1:06:27.221 --> 1:06:31.058
Well, guess we gotta cut
your dumb ass.

1:06:33.728 --> 1:06:34.796
Like hell you do.

1:06:34.829 --> 1:06:38.332
I'll cut you right back.

1:06:43.671 --> 1:06:46.039
Gotta rationalize the blood
if it comes up, so...

1:06:46.073 --> 1:06:48.275
Whoa!

1:06:50.778 --> 1:06:52.279
Ah...

1:06:52.312 --> 1:06:54.448
Man, are you gonna fuck this up?

1:06:54.481 --> 1:06:56.316
Calm down.

1:06:56.350 --> 1:06:59.219
Are you gonna fuck this up
for the both of us?

1:06:59.253 --> 1:07:00.487
Calm down, Chris.

1:07:00.522 --> 1:07:02.624
Adam's only got a little bit
of blood on his right shoulder.

1:07:02.657 --> 1:07:04.091
Okay?

1:07:04.124 --> 1:07:07.094
All he needs is a nick.

1:07:07.127 --> 1:07:09.764
Just a little nick, okay?

1:07:09.797 --> 1:07:11.231
Sure.

1:07:11.265 --> 1:07:12.466
- Don't move.
- Whoa!

1:07:12.499 --> 1:07:14.167
Whoa.

1:07:14.201 --> 1:07:17.605
Not you, let Barry do it.

1:07:17.639 --> 1:07:19.541
He's a gentle soul.

1:07:22.677 --> 1:07:24.244
Fair enough.

1:07:24.278 --> 1:07:25.547
No, no, no.

1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:26.548
No, no, no, no, no.

1:07:26.581 --> 1:07:28.415
- No.
- Okay.

1:07:28.448 --> 1:07:31.184
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no!

1:07:33.821 --> 1:07:36.123
Okay, okay.

1:07:36.156 --> 1:07:38.225
Give me the knife.

1:07:38.258 --> 1:07:39.527
I'll do it.

1:07:39.561 --> 1:07:40.862
Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it.

1:07:40.895 --> 1:07:41.863
You better make up your mind.

1:07:41.896 --> 1:07:43.130
I'll do it, I'll do it.

1:07:43.163 --> 1:07:45.667
Give me the knife, okay?

1:07:45.700 --> 1:07:47.234
I'll do it.

1:07:47.267 --> 1:07:49.571
I say we do it in the bathroom.

1:07:53.775 --> 1:07:55.710
God damn it!

1:07:58.913 --> 1:08:01.549
Ew, why isn't he melted?

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:04.451
Um, Adam, I have an idea.

1:08:04.484 --> 1:08:07.655
Maybe if you give me my phone,
I can, I can check.

1:08:07.689 --> 1:08:09.489
What, are you gonna check
your goddamn emails?

1:08:09.524 --> 1:08:10.357
We don't have time
for that shit.

1:08:10.390 --> 1:08:14.127
- Adam, will you relax?
- Sorry, Barry.

1:08:14.161 --> 1:08:16.229
We've gotta work together,
not against each other.

1:08:16.263 --> 1:08:17.397
I'll buy you a new one.

1:08:17.431 --> 1:08:19.333
Look, we have 90 minutes
until your friend comes back.

1:08:19.366 --> 1:08:21.435
- I know.
- We have to get rid of the body.

1:08:21.468 --> 1:08:23.136
- I know.
- Dissolving a body.

1:08:23.170 --> 1:08:25.540
Not fucking practical,
V.V. Stubbs.

1:08:30.878 --> 1:08:32.479
We can eat it.

1:08:32.513 --> 1:08:36.283
I'm just kidding.

1:08:36.316 --> 1:08:37.150
Burn it.

1:08:37.184 --> 1:08:37.852
- No!
- No!

1:08:37.885 --> 1:08:40.487
Okay, fine, no, geez.

1:08:40.521 --> 1:08:43.223
Once again, remove
the identifying features.

1:08:43.256 --> 1:08:45.727
- God.
- Yeah, okay.

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:46.928
Let's do that.

1:08:46.961 --> 1:08:50.263
Perfect.

1:08:50.297 --> 1:08:52.600
Well, Barry has his prints
all over that thing.

1:08:52.634 --> 1:08:53.901
Your the only one
with experience!

1:08:53.935 --> 1:08:55.570
- Jesus, Barry!
- Hey!

1:08:55.603 --> 1:08:58.573
God!

1:08:58.606 --> 1:09:00.240
I already cut into the foot,
you want me to do more?

1:09:00.273 --> 1:09:01.441
Nobody asked you
for the fucking foot.

1:09:01.475 --> 1:09:02.744
Did we ask him for the foot, no!

1:09:02.777 --> 1:09:03.711
Well, you have to cut
me anyways.

1:09:03.745 --> 1:09:06.346
- God, Chris, Chris, Chris.
- No, no, no, no.

1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:08.248
There's no fucking way Chris
is gonna cut me.

1:09:08.281 --> 1:09:10.250
Hey, look, if there was ever
a time that we need

1:09:10.283 --> 1:09:12.352
to come together,
now's the time.

1:09:12.386 --> 1:09:13.721
All right,
let's put our heads together

1:09:13.755 --> 1:09:15.523
and think this thing through.

1:09:15.556 --> 1:09:18.392
All right, in order to remove
the identifying features,

1:09:18.425 --> 1:09:19.927
we're going to have to
cut off the fingers

1:09:19.961 --> 1:09:22.764
and take out the teeth,
regardless,

1:09:22.797 --> 1:09:24.766
and still bury the body.

1:09:24.799 --> 1:09:26.701
- Chris is right.
- And Barry, be real.

1:09:26.734 --> 1:09:29.469
You can't dig that hole,
all right, so that's not on you.

1:09:29.503 --> 1:09:32.305
I can handle that.

1:09:32.339 --> 1:09:36.844
Um, hm, smashing out the teeth,
also not you.

1:09:36.878 --> 1:09:39.580
The only person capable
of doing that is you, Adam.

1:09:39.614 --> 1:09:41.415
That's probably true.

1:09:41.448 --> 1:09:44.752
Hey, you know, we're gonna
have to just band together,

1:09:44.786 --> 1:09:47.522
grind it out,
and just work as a team.

1:09:47.555 --> 1:09:48.756
All right, and I'll get you
something else

1:09:48.790 --> 1:09:49.924
to cut off the fingers.

1:09:49.957 --> 1:09:51.793
I don't wanna cut off
the fingers.

1:09:51.826 --> 1:09:53.695
Just cut off the prints then.

1:09:53.728 --> 1:09:55.697
- Just the prints?
- Yeah.

1:09:55.730 --> 1:09:57.765
I'll get something.

1:09:57.799 --> 1:10:00.735
Look, it's gonna be hard,
but you're going to do this.

1:10:00.768 --> 1:10:03.270
- I wanted to call the police.
- No, no.

1:10:03.303 --> 1:10:05.405
Hell no,
you said we were a team.

1:10:05.439 --> 1:10:06.741
You wanted to collaborate,
right?

1:10:06.774 --> 1:10:08.976
- So that's what we're doing.
- But why do I have to do that?

1:10:09.010 --> 1:10:10.978
"I, I, I" nothing.

1:10:11.012 --> 1:10:13.014
There is no "I" in "team."

1:10:13.047 --> 1:10:15.750
We are all in this together.

1:10:15.783 --> 1:10:17.417
Chris is right.

1:10:19.419 --> 1:10:20.555
Okay?

1:10:21.756 --> 1:10:24.792
Okay?

1:10:24.826 --> 1:10:26.961
We're doing this.

1:10:26.994 --> 1:10:28.629
Okay.

1:10:28.663 --> 1:10:30.698
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:10:30.732 --> 1:10:32.399
Okay.

1:10:32.432 --> 1:10:34.736
All right.

1:10:34.769 --> 1:10:37.572
Oh, Barry, fuck, that hurt!

1:10:37.605 --> 1:10:38.740
Shit, that's a lot of blood.

1:10:38.773 --> 1:10:40.975
- Is that an artery?
- Oh fuck!

1:10:41.008 --> 1:10:43.044
- Feeling lightheaded.
- Oh God, oh God, is that bad?

1:10:43.077 --> 1:10:45.680
- Are you okay, are you okay?
- How do you feel?

1:10:45.713 --> 1:10:48.549
Feel powerful, feel good,
you having a rush?

1:10:48.583 --> 1:10:51.552
Okay, all right,
well, good luck.

1:15:00.234 --> 1:15:01.869
Hey, guys.

1:15:04.672 --> 1:15:06.774
Mr. Stubbs is ready.

1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:15.216
What the fuck is that?

1:15:15.249 --> 1:15:20.788
Uh, "I'm about $50,000 in cash."

1:15:32.066 --> 1:15:34.335
What?

1:15:34.368 --> 1:15:37.838
I mean, this is every
single Gamechanger

1:15:37.872 --> 1:15:40.207
V.V. Stubbs has ever purchased,

1:15:40.241 --> 1:15:44.078
including every game asset
they've ever created.

1:15:44.111 --> 1:15:48.282
And best news is none of these
are released.

1:15:50.284 --> 1:15:51.819
Wait.

1:15:51.852 --> 1:15:55.689
So these are ideas
that haven't been used?

1:15:55.723 --> 1:15:57.191
That's right.

1:15:57.224 --> 1:16:00.061
That's fucking right.

1:16:00.094 --> 1:16:02.930
Holy shit.

1:16:02.963 --> 1:16:04.598
Holy shit!

1:16:04.632 --> 1:16:06.767
This is incredible.

1:16:06.801 --> 1:16:09.003
- Oh my God.
- Mhm.

1:16:09.036 --> 1:16:11.038
Uh, hello?

1:16:11.072 --> 1:16:13.908
We have money here!

1:16:13.941 --> 1:16:18.079
There is money here, okay?

1:16:18.112 --> 1:16:21.315
I'm not an advocate
of people dying, but,

1:16:21.348 --> 1:16:22.950
in this case, it's okay.

1:16:22.983 --> 1:16:23.984
Yeah!

1:16:32.393 --> 1:16:34.662
Will you help me get
my backpack please?

1:16:47.875 --> 1:16:50.077
Hey, uh, real question here.

1:16:50.111 --> 1:16:51.645
You guys think I need stitches
for this thing?

1:16:51.679 --> 1:16:52.746
Probably not.
Did it really hurt

1:16:52.780 --> 1:16:54.081
or are we just trying
to get out of there quickly?

1:16:54.115 --> 1:16:55.116
Yeah, man, you really hurt me.

1:16:55.149 --> 1:16:57.718
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:17:01.021 --> 1:17:02.990
Hold up, hold up, hold on.

1:17:04.925 --> 1:17:06.327
Hey, I'm sorry about
your phone, Barry.

1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:07.895
I'll get you a new one.

1:17:07.928 --> 1:17:09.330
Yeah, with your fat pile
of money?

1:17:09.363 --> 1:17:13.134
Our fat pile of money.

1:17:15.269 --> 1:17:17.872
I just got fired.

1:17:17.905 --> 1:17:19.340
Okay, guys,
everything's gonna be okay.

1:17:19.373 --> 1:17:20.875
Let's just get going.

1:17:20.908 --> 1:17:22.376
No loose threads.

1:17:22.409 --> 1:17:24.912
- No loose threads.
- And just think,

1:17:24.945 --> 1:17:27.148
now we have enough money
to publish our game.

1:17:27.181 --> 1:17:29.817
Yeah, I know,
and not just the one.

1:17:29.850 --> 1:17:31.418
You gotta take a look
at these other games, man.

1:17:31.452 --> 1:17:33.754
- They're so good.
- Yeah.

1:17:33.787 --> 1:17:35.890
What other games,
what do you mean?

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:42.897
The games in the box.

1:17:42.930 --> 1:17:45.833
Those are other people's
games, Chris.

1:17:45.866 --> 1:17:48.903
Those aren't ours.

1:17:48.936 --> 1:17:52.273
Uh, hey, V.V. Stubbs,
Mummy Picnic,

1:17:52.306 --> 1:17:56.043
you care that we use
some of your games?

1:17:56.076 --> 1:17:59.346
Maybe I'll torture him,
that'll get him to talk.

1:17:59.380 --> 1:18:01.015
- Can I have that back?
- No.

1:18:04.051 --> 1:18:06.720
I thought we were gonna give
the games back to people.

1:18:06.754 --> 1:18:08.022
Why would we do that?

1:18:08.055 --> 1:18:10.457
Mr. Stubbs bought them
fair and square.

1:18:10.491 --> 1:18:13.160
They made their choice, now
he's dead and we inherit them.

1:18:13.194 --> 1:18:14.128
Are you serious, Chris?

1:18:14.161 --> 1:18:15.029
It's not right.

1:18:15.062 --> 1:18:18.132
And how would we return
the games, Barry?

1:18:18.165 --> 1:18:20.467
I don't know, email them?

1:18:20.501 --> 1:18:23.871
Saying what, what would be
the explanation behind that?

1:18:23.904 --> 1:18:25.739
Let me just
figure something out.

1:18:25.773 --> 1:18:27.708
We don't have time for that.

1:18:42.423 --> 1:18:43.958
Gonna help me?

1:19:00.975 --> 1:19:02.910
Okay, this is as good of a spot

1:19:02.943 --> 1:19:04.478
to divide and conquer,
isn't it?

1:19:04.512 --> 1:19:06.447
So we'll bury the body.

1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:08.882
- You scatter the...
- Mutilated finger scraps.

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:09.917
- Okay.
- And the shattered teeth.

1:19:09.950 --> 1:19:11.352
I said, "Okay."

1:19:13.153 --> 1:19:16.056
Okay, you got this, man.

1:19:16.090 --> 1:19:17.958
Okay, we'll meet back here
in, uh,

1:19:17.992 --> 1:19:19.293
how long does it take
to bury a body?

1:19:19.326 --> 1:19:21.495
I don't know.
Let's say like an hour.

1:19:21.529 --> 1:19:23.097
Okay, well, we'll text you.

1:19:23.130 --> 1:19:25.366
Oh, crap, forgot.

1:19:25.399 --> 1:19:28.102
Cut you off from civilization.

1:19:31.606 --> 1:19:34.008
You good, bro?

1:19:36.578 --> 1:19:38.412
All right.

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:42.483
Listen, if we don't look out
for ourselves,

1:19:42.517 --> 1:19:44.051
then who else will?

1:19:44.084 --> 1:19:45.587
We're the little guys in this.

1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:47.454
We can't give up,
we got to be tenacious,

1:19:47.488 --> 1:19:51.125
persistent, optimistic,
but more importantly,

1:19:51.158 --> 1:19:53.193
we got to work as a team.

1:19:54.862 --> 1:19:58.232
Besides, getting rid
of the competition, right?

1:19:59.967 --> 1:20:01.268
Life is gonna look
a hell of a lot better

1:20:01.302 --> 1:20:04.338
from here on out.

1:20:04.371 --> 1:20:07.141
All right,
so let's bury the body,

1:20:07.174 --> 1:20:10.878
you scatter or do whatever
with the identifying features,

1:20:10.911 --> 1:20:13.981
and we carry on
with our fucking lives.

1:20:38.573 --> 1:20:41.975
God damnit, Stubbs,
you're heavy.

1:21:22.950 --> 1:21:24.652
How much deeper?

1:21:27.054 --> 1:21:28.656
You heard Mr. Stubbs.

1:21:28.690 --> 1:21:31.526
Can't have critters
digging him up now, can we?

1:21:33.127 --> 1:21:36.598
Well, how deep is deep enough?

1:21:36.631 --> 1:21:39.900
What? What, are you gonna
dig six feet?

1:21:42.403 --> 1:21:43.671
Hello?

1:21:46.508 --> 1:21:48.510
Chris?

1:22:12.299 --> 1:22:15.102
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah?

1:22:20.107 --> 1:22:22.309
We should say something.

1:22:22.342 --> 1:22:25.078
Okay. Go ahead.

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:48.502
- He bailed on us, man.
- He ain't bail on us.

1:22:48.536 --> 1:22:50.003
Yeah, how big was the hole
you had to dig?

1:22:50.037 --> 1:22:52.507
Look, Adam, stop being
so damn cynical.

1:22:52.540 --> 1:22:54.274
It's about Officer Dan time.

1:22:54.308 --> 1:22:56.778
You don't think
he just took the finger scraps

1:22:56.811 --> 1:23:01.348
and ratted on us,
took the games and the money

1:23:01.381 --> 1:23:03.718
and just... just threw us
under the bus?

1:23:03.751 --> 1:23:05.018
That's not Barry.

1:23:05.052 --> 1:23:06.320
He wouldn't switch on us
like that.

1:23:06.353 --> 1:23:07.555
Go find him before he does.

1:23:07.589 --> 1:23:09.691
- You're just gonna sit?
- Yeah.

1:23:09.724 --> 1:23:12.426
He cut me. I'm weak.

1:23:12.459 --> 1:23:14.194
Oh, "I'm weak."

1:23:14.228 --> 1:23:16.564
- Yeah, go find him.
- Whatever.

1:24:41.415 --> 1:24:43.383
Hey!

1:24:43.417 --> 1:24:45.218
Hey!

1:24:49.791 --> 1:24:51.726
What are you doing?

1:24:56.163 --> 1:24:57.364
Give me the game.

1:25:26.828 --> 1:25:29.496
Let me see the bag.

1:25:29.530 --> 1:25:31.633
Hey, relax.

1:25:31.666 --> 1:25:32.634
Relax.

1:25:32.667 --> 1:25:33.935
Hey, the money is here.

1:25:33.968 --> 1:25:35.803
The finger bag is done.

1:25:35.837 --> 1:25:38.205
- Where are the games?
- Ugh.

1:25:38.238 --> 1:25:39.473
Adam, where are the games?

1:25:39.507 --> 1:25:40.708
Barrett was burning them.

1:25:40.742 --> 1:25:43.343
I mean that fucker was just
going to town on those things,

1:25:43.377 --> 1:25:46.781
but I saved one.

1:25:55.957 --> 1:25:58.258
Where's Barry?

1:26:00.828 --> 1:26:04.866
Uh, we got a new mess
on our hands now,

1:26:04.899 --> 1:26:07.467
but, uh, we're pros
at this, man.

1:26:07.501 --> 1:26:08.803
We got this.

1:26:11.739 --> 1:26:13.641
We got this.

1:26:13.675 --> 1:26:14.976
We got this.

1:26:15.009 --> 1:26:17.712
You and I, we got this.

1:26:17.745 --> 1:26:21.683
We got this,
you and I got this.

1:26:36.329 --> 1:26:40.668
Oh, did you want
to say something?

1:26:42.937 --> 1:26:45.573
One copy of Murder, Bury, Win.

1:26:47.575 --> 1:26:50.243
- Yeah, that's right.
- I love this game.

1:26:50.277 --> 1:26:51.579
Have you played it?

1:26:53.514 --> 1:26:55.449
No, I hear it's really good.

1:26:55.482 --> 1:26:56.851
Yeah, I mean,
it's selling out faster

1:26:56.884 --> 1:26:58.820
than Murder Wall at this rate.

1:26:58.853 --> 1:27:00.822
Hm. Oh, yeah?

1:27:00.855 --> 1:27:05.492
Hey, you know my dad met
V.V. Stubbs once?

1:27:05.526 --> 1:27:06.794
- Hm, did he?
- Yeah.

1:27:06.828 --> 1:27:07.929
I mean, it's a secret,
though, okay?

1:27:07.962 --> 1:27:10.397
So don't tell anyone,
okay, shh.

1:27:10.430 --> 1:27:11.966
I mean, I guess he has a place
around here or something,

1:27:11.999 --> 1:27:13.768
but, you know...

1:27:13.801 --> 1:27:14.736
I was supposed to meet him too,

1:27:14.769 --> 1:27:16.037
but he was a no-show.

1:27:16.070 --> 1:27:18.438
Go figure, right?

1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:24.579
Perhaps he didn't want
to be found.

1:27:24.612 --> 1:27:28.248
You know, some geniuses
are like that, you know?

1:27:29.382 --> 1:27:30.317
Yeah, I mean, whatever.

1:27:30.350 --> 1:27:32.452
I mean, it'd still be cool
to meet him.

1:27:32.486 --> 1:27:34.922
Or even the guys that made
this game, that'd be cool.

1:27:36.490 --> 1:27:38.960
Yeah, that'd be cool.

1:28:54.535 --> 1:28:56.571
Is someone standing
in the way of your dreams?

1:28:56.604 --> 1:28:59.140
Well, I have
the perfect solution for you.

1:28:59.173 --> 1:29:02.375
Just murder, bury, win.

1:29:02.409 --> 1:29:03.711
Hi, I'm Adam.

1:29:03.744 --> 1:29:04.512
I'm here to tell you about

1:29:04.545 --> 1:29:06.446
a new murder mystery
board game.

1:29:06.479 --> 1:29:09.750
The twist, you're the killer,
and in order to win,

1:29:09.784 --> 1:29:11.519
you've got to get away with it.

1:29:11.552 --> 1:29:12.720
With me so far?

1:29:12.753 --> 1:29:14.989
Great! Let's talk murder.

1:29:15.022 --> 1:29:17.592
But, first,
a little bit about me.

1:29:17.625 --> 1:29:18.926
I'm a smart, driven,

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:20.728
passionate entrepreneur
who's ready to take

1:29:20.761 --> 1:29:22.830
the board gaming industry
by storm.

1:29:22.864 --> 1:29:25.032
And this is my friend, Chris.

1:29:25.066 --> 1:29:27.602
Chris is smart,
Chris is loyal,

1:29:27.635 --> 1:29:29.436
Chris is a really good friend.

1:29:29.469 --> 1:29:31.906
And he and I came up
with this concept.

1:29:31.939 --> 1:29:34.441
Just him and I, two friends.
