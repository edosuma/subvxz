00:00.167 --> 00:01.167
<i>d":</i>

00:02.437 --> 00:03.838
Hey, you're okay.

00:04.973 --> 00:06.306
Good boy.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.408
This is my trailer.
I'm movin' back in!

00:08.476 --> 00:10.510
Not likely, cowboy Bob!

00:10.578 --> 00:12.045
<i>I got nowhere to stay
but in my truck.</i>

00:12.113 --> 00:14.347
- You can bunk in the loft.
- Really?

00:14.415 --> 00:15.783
I am gonna do
whatever it takes

00:15.850 --> 00:17.017
to get him out
of my loft!

00:17.085 --> 00:18.118
We could set him up
with Ashley.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.386
With or without Ashley,

00:19.453 --> 00:20.353
he is goin' back
to that trailer.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.821
Val! I-I wanted
to talk to you.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.055
I've reconsidered,

00:23.123 --> 00:24.290
and I think I'd like
to sell you the property.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.892
Okay,
I'll think about it.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.160
What?

00:27.227 --> 00:28.828
May not make economic sense
for me at this time.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.562
You are not gonna believe this!

00:30.630 --> 00:33.166
<i>It's already had
almost 3,000 hits!</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:34.366
"Miracle girl?"

00:34.434 --> 00:35.467
You're famous.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.069
Just, I have a zillion
new emails.

00:39.237 --> 00:40.505
I don't
know how I'm gonna do this.

00:46.078 --> 00:47.979
Good boy.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.347
Good boy!

00:50.449 --> 00:52.117
- Hey!
- Hey, how's it going?

00:52.185 --> 00:53.750
Great! It's awesome
what he can do,

00:53.819 --> 00:54.985
<i>once you've freed up
his head.</i>

00:55.053 --> 00:57.354
I could use, uh,
15 more minutes, though.

00:57.422 --> 00:58.789
You don't got it.

00:59.991 --> 01:00.791
Okay, who's next?

01:00.859 --> 01:02.092
<i>Come on!</i>

01:02.160 --> 01:04.561
What's wrong with this guy?

01:04.629 --> 01:05.662
That's Roxie.

01:05.730 --> 01:06.931
He's barn sour.

01:06.998 --> 01:08.032
If it was up to him,

01:08.099 --> 01:09.765
he'd never come out
of his stall.

01:09.834 --> 01:11.500
If it were up to me,
he'd hang out in there all day!

01:11.568 --> 01:13.203
Well, just leave him.
I'll take care of it.

01:13.270 --> 01:15.205
You come walk
this guy out.

01:18.909 --> 01:20.210
I mean, I can put up
with the snoring,

01:20.277 --> 01:22.178
and his dirty clothes
all over the place.

01:22.246 --> 01:24.247
But his broken-hearted
cowboy routine,

01:24.315 --> 01:26.548
night after night,
I can't stand it!

01:26.615 --> 01:29.617
Wow! I never knew you had
such a cold, cold heart.

01:29.685 --> 01:30.785
Well, neither did I,
until...

01:30.854 --> 01:31.920
<i>Hey!</i>

01:31.988 --> 01:33.822
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

01:33.890 --> 01:34.756
I better get out
of here.

01:34.824 --> 01:36.892
Yeah, okay.

01:37.861 --> 01:39.161
Where's he going?

01:39.229 --> 01:40.995
To round up the other horses.

01:41.063 --> 01:43.130
But I thought I was
the horse-rounding-up guy.

01:43.198 --> 01:45.466
<i>Yeah, well, today,
you're the goin'-into-town guy.</i>

01:45.533 --> 01:46.968
Grampa's gotta do a supply run
at Maggie's.

01:47.035 --> 01:48.002
Here, Mallory.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.337
Is Ash working today?

01:49.404 --> 01:51.005
How should I know?

01:51.073 --> 01:52.240
Barn sour, huh?

01:52.307 --> 01:53.941
Once they're settled in,
that's just about that.

01:54.009 --> 01:55.142
That's funny,

01:55.210 --> 01:56.477
coming from someone
who moved into the barn

01:56.544 --> 01:58.178
on a strictly temporary basis,

01:58.246 --> 02:00.646
and has ignored all the hints
about cramping people's style,

02:00.714 --> 02:02.482
and taking up
a lot of space.

02:02.549 --> 02:05.051
Not to mention hogging
my favourite frozen bagels!

02:05.119 --> 02:07.053
Those are frozen?

02:09.090 --> 02:11.056
<i>I figure I can pick up
a few fence panels,</i>

02:11.125 --> 02:13.926
and tack up a couple pens
behind the barn.

02:16.096 --> 02:17.096
<i>If things keep up this way,</i>

02:17.163 --> 02:19.064
we might need
a whole new barn, too.

02:19.132 --> 02:20.732
Tell that to your father.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.068
The way he's throwing money
around these days...

02:23.136 --> 02:24.270
Grampa...

02:24.337 --> 02:25.670
It all starts with
that herd of cows,

02:25.738 --> 02:27.639
now that fancy new phone
he got for Amy.

02:27.707 --> 02:28.774
Why not a new barn?

02:28.841 --> 02:29.941
You know,
you lent him the money.

02:30.009 --> 02:31.742
You can't really tell him
how to spend it.

02:31.810 --> 02:34.245
Yeah, heard it all before
one too many times.

02:34.313 --> 02:35.813
Morning, Jack.

02:35.881 --> 02:38.116
<i>Yeah, fine, thanks.</i>

02:40.552 --> 02:41.786
Hey, Jack!

02:44.356 --> 02:45.488
What's with him?

02:45.556 --> 02:48.392
Not really
a morning person.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.894
So...

02:50.962 --> 02:53.130
This one was...
Hit by a car,

02:53.197 --> 02:55.933
uh, that one was freaked out
by a lightning strike,

02:56.000 --> 02:57.801
and this one is...

02:57.868 --> 02:58.735
Ahhhh!

02:58.803 --> 02:59.769
Mouthy.

02:59.837 --> 03:01.470
Thanks for the warning!

03:01.538 --> 03:02.939
Dad, we are so crowded,

03:03.006 --> 03:04.873
I'm keeping horses
in the jumping ring.

03:04.942 --> 03:07.476
I mean, it's like everyone
who saw that YouTube video

03:07.544 --> 03:10.612
hit on the exact
same solution: Amy.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.081
<i>You gotta seize this moment!</i>

03:12.149 --> 03:13.549
Well, that's what
we're trying to do, Dad.

03:13.616 --> 03:15.684
I mean, so far, Amy can
manage all these horses.

03:15.752 --> 03:16.819
But the problem is,

03:16.886 --> 03:18.053
I can keep up
with all these out-of-towners

03:18.120 --> 03:19.687
who wanna book places
at the dude ranch,

03:19.755 --> 03:21.957
- so...
- Honey, expansion.

03:22.024 --> 03:23.358
Expansion.
That's what I'm talking about.

03:23.426 --> 03:24.960
- Right.
- Look...

03:25.027 --> 03:26.227
<i>Excuse me?</i>

03:26.295 --> 03:27.628
Hi, I'm Kate,

03:27.696 --> 03:29.197
and this is my daughter,
Taylor.

03:29.265 --> 03:30.631
We're looking
for Amy Fleming?

03:30.699 --> 03:32.300
Uh... Kate Kennedy?

03:32.368 --> 03:33.700
Mm-hm.

03:33.768 --> 03:35.869
Oh, I'm sorry.
You didn't get my e-mail.

03:35.937 --> 03:37.137
I got it.

03:37.205 --> 03:39.106
And I realize this
is kind of a long shot.

03:39.174 --> 03:40.107
I-I just didn't think
that we could wait

03:40.175 --> 03:41.908
six weeks
for an opening.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.877
Uh... I know,
I'm sorry.

03:43.945 --> 03:44.979
We're totally booked up
right now.

03:45.046 --> 03:46.246
See, Mom?

03:46.314 --> 03:47.147
I told you it was stupid
for us to come.

03:47.215 --> 03:50.016
It's been
a very long drive.

03:50.084 --> 03:52.118
If Amy could just take
a look at Taylor's horse,

03:52.186 --> 03:53.987
then I-I would...

03:54.054 --> 03:57.123
You know, I'm sure that
Amy'd be happy to do that.

03:57.191 --> 04:00.259
I'm Tim Fleming.
I'm Amy's dad.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.827
This is my daughter,
Lou Fleming.

04:01.895 --> 04:04.030
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:06.966 --> 04:08.300
<i>Hey, you got Roxie
out of the barn.</i>

04:08.368 --> 04:11.536
Better yet,
I got Caleb to go with Grampa.

04:13.072 --> 04:14.373
And Ash's on
the breakfast shift?

04:14.440 --> 04:16.208
They'll at least
have to talk, right?

04:16.274 --> 04:17.742
I never knew you were
such a sneaky little...

04:17.810 --> 04:20.745
There's lots of things
you don't know about me.

04:25.550 --> 04:27.518
- Who is it?
- Lou.

04:27.585 --> 04:29.520
We gotta get back.

04:29.587 --> 04:30.687
Talk about timing,
huh?

04:30.755 --> 04:31.688
It's like she knows.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.196
Um, I'm kind of booked up
today.

04:40.264 --> 04:41.631
Can you maybe have them
come back another time?

04:41.698 --> 04:44.534
Yeah, obviously I tried.
But Dad had other ideas.

04:45.169 --> 04:46.836
- Uh, Kate?  - Hi.
- Amy Flemming.

04:47.404 --> 04:48.938
<i>I know,
I sound like such a fan,</i>

04:49.006 --> 04:50.673
<i>I just can't believe
I'm meeting you in person!</i>

04:50.741 --> 04:52.374
I swear, she must've seen
that video

04:52.442 --> 04:53.208
like a thousand times

04:53.276 --> 04:56.078
when she first got out
of the hospital.

04:56.146 --> 04:59.581
There was an accident.
Her horse, Trooper,

04:59.649 --> 05:00.916
he's always been
so perfect,

05:00.983 --> 05:02.951
and then, one day,
he just bolted and...

05:05.455 --> 05:07.789
I-I'm not so sure
that's such a good idea!

05:07.857 --> 05:10.158
No, he seems fine.

05:10.225 --> 05:11.159
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

05:11.226 --> 05:12.293
<i>Whoa! Watch it!</i>

05:12.361 --> 05:14.562
<i>No! Ahh!</i>

05:14.663 --> 05:15.629
Taylor!

05:16.731 --> 05:17.765
Come here.

05:17.832 --> 05:19.200
I'm okay, Mom.

05:19.268 --> 05:21.802

<i>Well, he seems pretty calm now.</i>

06:10.149 --> 06:12.550
Don't worry,
I got the gate.

06:44.448 --> 06:46.548
He seems like a pretty
well-broke horse.

06:46.616 --> 06:48.483
What about the way he lunged
at that little girl?

06:48.551 --> 06:49.884
You ever seen that before?

06:49.952 --> 06:52.987
I don't know.
Only with abused horses.

06:53.055 --> 06:54.556
By a ten-year-old?

06:54.624 --> 06:56.424
Never underestimate
the ten-year-old girl.

06:56.492 --> 06:57.592
I still have nightmares

06:57.660 --> 06:59.194
about those parties
in grade five!

06:59.262 --> 07:00.795
Well, maybe you could
do me a favour, Mallory.

07:00.863 --> 07:02.829
Get to know the girl
who owns this horse,

07:02.930 --> 07:03.997
find out what she's like,

07:04.065 --> 07:05.832
what her relationship
with Trooper is.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.203
Well, do you mean, like...
A friend? Or a spy?

07:09.271 --> 07:11.938
How about just someone
who's trying to help? Hmm?

07:12.006 --> 07:13.006
Her name's Taylor.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.509
All right.

07:15.577 --> 07:17.910
Oh...

07:17.978 --> 07:20.180
Oh, this is wonderful,
Lou!

07:20.247 --> 07:22.048
I'm so glad
you could squeeze us in.

07:22.115 --> 07:23.816
<i>Oh, you know,</i>

07:23.884 --> 07:25.251
what's a couple days,
right?

07:27.588 --> 07:31.057
<i>I told the next guest
we had an overflow problem.</i>

07:31.124 --> 07:33.059
They thought I was talking
about the outhouse, but...

07:34.027 --> 07:35.661
If our life didn't suck
so thoroughly right now,

07:35.729 --> 07:36.996
this would be like
a dream vacation.

07:41.401 --> 07:44.369
My daugher's just been going
through a lot lately.

07:52.411 --> 07:56.014
Hey! I saw Amy riding
your horse today.

07:56.082 --> 07:57.082
She said he was amazing.

07:59.384 --> 08:00.585
Amy said that?

08:00.652 --> 08:02.420
Yeah,
and she would know.

08:02.487 --> 08:04.756
Uh... so is that your horse?

08:05.790 --> 08:07.357
Sort of.
He's half my horse.

08:07.425 --> 08:08.458
His name's Copper.

08:08.526 --> 08:09.893
He has his own
Facebook page.

08:09.961 --> 08:10.894
Wow.

08:12.330 --> 08:13.430
All my friends do it.

08:13.497 --> 08:14.631
It's sorta just us,
though,

08:14.699 --> 08:17.935
but we take our horses'
names...

08:18.002 --> 08:19.336
Why don't I add you
as a friend,

08:19.403 --> 08:21.238
and I can hook you up
with all my horse friends.

08:21.305 --> 08:23.873
I could hook you up
with my horse friends, too!

08:23.941 --> 08:26.375
Um... but I'm not sure

08:26.443 --> 08:28.911
if I'm still gonna
even have a horse.

08:28.979 --> 08:31.814
I mean,
I think he really hates me.

08:32.982 --> 08:33.916
No way.

08:35.452 --> 08:36.818
We were just like normal...

08:36.886 --> 08:39.087
And then he went totally berserk
and ran like a maniac

08:39.155 --> 08:41.322
until I couldn't stay on
anymore.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.924
Did you hurt yourself?

08:42.991 --> 08:44.192
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

08:44.260 --> 08:46.061
I was in the hospital
like, forever.

08:46.129 --> 08:48.796
Well, don't worry.
Amy can fix any horse.

08:48.864 --> 08:51.232
It's like she knows
what they're thinking.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.867
Like a mind reader?

08:54.503 --> 08:56.404
Do you think...

08:56.472 --> 08:58.906
Maybe she knows
what I'm thinking too?

09:07.882 --> 09:12.686
<i>Hey, uh... you uh...
feel like havin' a coffee?</i>

09:12.754 --> 09:13.787
No.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.455
Then, go get me one.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.492
I just can't get
a break today.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.595
<i>How you doing, Val?</i>

09:22.663 --> 09:24.930
Oh, you know.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.467
I just wanna make sure
that you understand,

09:28.535 --> 09:31.304
Tim sells you that piece
of land,

09:31.371 --> 09:33.372
I'm glad to have you
as a neighbour,

09:33.440 --> 09:35.107
on both sides.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.140
Well.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.443
Never thought I'd hear that

09:38.511 --> 09:40.278
comin' out of your lips,
Jack.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.783
Ah, I don't think you've been
talking to Tim, though.

09:44.850 --> 09:45.950
In this economy,

09:46.018 --> 09:48.720
it doesn't make sense
to develop acreages.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.355
So you're not buying?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.323
No.
Nobody's buying.

09:52.390 --> 09:55.326
But surely you're not worried
about anything, are you?

09:55.393 --> 09:56.893
I hear Heartland's business
is booming.

09:56.961 --> 09:59.095
Yeah...

09:59.163 --> 10:01.264
But this isn't
a business issue, Val.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.468
It's a...
an ex-son-in-law issue.

10:06.871 --> 10:07.837
Right.

10:13.344 --> 10:16.579
Look who's sitting
in your section.

10:18.515 --> 10:19.716
Can't you take it?

10:19.783 --> 10:21.351
I'm on break.

10:24.153 --> 10:26.521
Just one coffee to go.
Please.

10:35.698 --> 10:37.031
<i>Oh!</i>

10:37.099 --> 10:39.467
<i>Oh! </i>

10:43.538 --> 10:44.905
You know, I think
you missed the glass.

10:44.973 --> 10:46.640
And I think you missed
the point.

10:46.708 --> 10:47.908
And I think you're insane

10:47.976 --> 10:48.909
if you think a little bit
of cold water

10:48.977 --> 10:49.977
is gonna get rid of me.

10:50.044 --> 10:51.679
Oh, I'm not trying
to get rid of you,

10:51.747 --> 10:54.147
I just wanna remind you
what a cold shower feels like.

10:54.215 --> 10:55.750
You know, when the water
heater's broken,

10:55.817 --> 10:57.417
and no one bothers
to fix it?!

10:57.485 --> 10:58.418
Jeez!

11:01.089 --> 11:03.056
So, how's the coffee comin'?

11:04.192 --> 11:05.926
Coming right up, Jack.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.701
<i>You know,
it's my damn trailer!</i>

11:15.769 --> 11:17.569
And she's living there
rent-free!

11:17.637 --> 11:18.871
A-a-and I'm supposed
to feel guilty

11:18.939 --> 11:21.274
'cause little miss princess
doesn't have hot water!

11:21.341 --> 11:22.441
Yeah, but you know
Ashley, man.

11:22.509 --> 11:23.809
You gotta keep
talkin' to her

11:23.877 --> 11:24.944
if you want any sort
of relationship with her.

11:25.012 --> 11:28.880
Relationship?
There is no relationship!

11:28.948 --> 11:32.483
I... I just want
my damn trailer back.

11:32.551 --> 11:33.651
She's trying to make
a point, man.

11:33.719 --> 11:35.320
Yeah? And what would
that point be?

11:35.388 --> 11:38.623
Because apparently,
I just keep missing it!

11:38.690 --> 11:41.092
The point is
you're a jerk!

11:41.160 --> 11:42.794
You lied to her.
You took her mom's money,

11:42.861 --> 11:45.062
and now you won't even fix
her water heater.

11:45.130 --> 11:46.330
Just keep it up, man.

11:46.398 --> 11:49.333
You're never gonna get
your trailer back.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.458
Set another place.

12:15.959 --> 12:18.160
Dad has invited himself
for dinner.

12:18.227 --> 12:19.828
What,
now I'm feeding him too?

12:19.895 --> 12:21.296
<i>He says he's got big plans</i>

12:21.364 --> 12:23.498
on how to expand
the dude ranch.

12:23.566 --> 12:24.566
The problem is,

12:24.633 --> 12:27.102
Dad's plans always end up
costing more than I can afford.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.571
Yeah, well, more than
he can afford too, considering.

12:29.638 --> 12:31.106
Grampa,
you gotta promise me,

12:31.174 --> 12:32.906
no matter what he says...

12:32.975 --> 12:34.775
I'm staying out of it.

12:35.810 --> 12:36.777
Okay.

12:39.914 --> 12:40.781
Motorhomes.
Motorhomes!

12:43.485 --> 12:44.585
Motorhomes?

12:44.652 --> 12:46.354
Yeah. To solve Lou's
accommodation problem.

12:46.421 --> 12:47.855
<i>Dad, you mean, like, trailers?</i>

12:47.922 --> 12:50.590
Nothing like trailers to solve
an accommodation problem.

12:50.657 --> 12:52.558
<i>I talked to the guy
at a dealership, right?</i>

12:52.626 --> 12:54.294
Their sales are down,
they're overstocked,

12:54.362 --> 12:56.629
we'd be doing him a favour
taking these.

12:56.697 --> 12:58.064
<i>Now,
it's not a perfect solution,</i>

12:58.132 --> 13:00.033
<i>but who knows how big
this thing can get?</i>

13:00.101 --> 13:02.469
You can do books, DVDs,
clinics.

13:02.536 --> 13:04.203
There are a million different
ways to make money

13:04.270 --> 13:05.737
off this horse whispering
thing.

13:05.805 --> 13:07.406
Dad, please don't call it that,
it makes me feel weird.

13:07.474 --> 13:08.907
But I'm just saying,

13:08.975 --> 13:11.910
some strategically placed
motorhomes around the lake,

13:11.978 --> 13:14.179
would triple your revenue, Lou.

13:14.247 --> 13:17.682
You know, a man wants to turn
his own ranch into a suburb.

13:18.784 --> 13:20.385
<i>It doesn't surprise me</i>

13:20.452 --> 13:23.921
that he wants to turn my ranch
into a trailer park.

13:23.989 --> 13:26.324
But I'm not getting involved.

13:27.659 --> 13:29.260
You know,
that's-that's too bad, Jack.

13:29.328 --> 13:30.594
'Cause you know how
I value your opinion.

13:32.398 --> 13:33.797
Excuse me, everyone.

13:33.865 --> 13:37.300
I'm sorry, Lou.
But has anyone seen Taylor?

14:24.679 --> 14:26.280
Taylor!

14:26.347 --> 14:27.548
<i>Taylor!</i>

14:27.615 --> 14:28.848
<i>I just don't want you
to get hurt</i>

14:28.916 --> 14:29.883
<i>by that horse again!</i>

14:29.951 --> 14:30.784
No! Mom!

14:30.851 --> 14:33.220
I'm not stupid, Mom!

14:33.288 --> 14:34.955
<i>I remember what happened.</i>

14:35.022 --> 14:36.056
But I miss him so much!

14:38.693 --> 14:41.227
He's my best friend.

14:41.795 --> 14:44.964
I just wanted
to be near him.

14:45.031 --> 14:47.233
Come here.
Oh, baby.

14:50.704 --> 14:54.207
Trust me,
she's nobody's baby.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.035
What do you want?

15:17.141 --> 15:18.442
<i>What?</i>

15:25.049 --> 15:26.316
Hey, girl!

15:28.618 --> 15:29.886
Aren't you done yet?

15:29.954 --> 15:33.489
<i>You know, I
just started, and...</i>

15:34.524 --> 15:36.258
I'd really like
to make sure this is tight.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.828
Well, could you hurry it up?

15:38.895 --> 15:41.797
I'd like you to be gone
before I leave for school.

15:41.865 --> 15:43.666
You know,
uh... when I'm done,

15:43.734 --> 15:45.000
I could take a look
at the roof,

15:45.068 --> 15:47.302
maybe do something about
the window screens?

15:47.371 --> 15:48.936
Uh, yeah. Whatever.

15:49.004 --> 15:50.338
Just put Nikki
back inside

15:50.406 --> 15:51.939
and lock up
before you go.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.183
<i>What do you mean,
you're going to school?</i>

16:02.251 --> 16:03.752
<i>It's a school day.</i>

16:03.819 --> 16:04.718
<i>Yeah, so what am I supposed
to do?</i>

16:04.786 --> 16:05.886
Watch your horse!

16:05.953 --> 16:07.053
Watch him do what?

16:07.121 --> 16:09.189
Eat, sleep, drink,
whatever he does.

16:09.257 --> 16:11.191
All right? Here.
Take notes,

16:11.259 --> 16:12.459
draw pictures.

16:12.527 --> 16:14.160
I expect a full report
when I get back.

16:14.228 --> 16:15.562
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.264
Do you keep Trooper
in a boarding stable?

16:17.331 --> 16:18.932
Yeah,
like everybody does.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.133
Yeah? So, your mom
drives you out there,

16:21.201 --> 16:22.034
someone's already
caught your horse,

16:22.102 --> 16:23.335
tacked him up.

16:23.404 --> 16:25.137
You just take a lesson
for what, an hour,

16:25.205 --> 16:26.972
and then give him a kiss
and go home?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.941
Sort of, yeah.
So what?

16:29.009 --> 16:30.610
So, if you really wanna be
best friends with your horse,

16:30.677 --> 16:32.244
you're gonna have to get
to know him.

16:32.312 --> 16:33.746
Spend some time
with him,

16:33.814 --> 16:36.715
know what he likes,
what he doesn't, okay?

16:36.783 --> 16:38.349
Okay.

16:39.419 --> 16:41.052
Good.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.554
You know Ty?

16:44.857 --> 16:47.626
He's gonna keep an eye
on you guys today.

16:47.693 --> 16:48.660
Bye.

17:01.506 --> 17:04.273
If this is about the motorhomes,
I don't have time.

17:04.342 --> 17:05.910
Well, you can take
those motorhomes,

17:05.977 --> 17:07.444
and you know where
you can park 'em.

17:07.512 --> 17:10.212
And I talked to Val Stanton.
Now, why didn't you tell me?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.080
Tell you what?
That she changed her mind?

17:12.148 --> 17:13.483
She lost her nerve?

17:13.550 --> 17:16.018
Lookit, that woman's not
the only game in town, Jack.

17:16.086 --> 17:17.319
Lots of fish in the sea.

17:17.387 --> 17:18.887
I've got lots of irons
in the fire.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.423
Hmph. Fire.
There are no fires.

17:20.491 --> 17:23.192
Do you ever pay attention
to anything, at all?

17:23.260 --> 17:25.527
Nobody's selling
'cause nobody's buying.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.362
Oh, this isn't about
the loan, now.

17:27.430 --> 17:29.698
Now I'm responsible
for the whole bad economy?

17:29.766 --> 17:31.299
Well, it's gonna get better
in a couple of years, Jack.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.368
Well, maybe I don't wanna wait
a couple of years.

17:33.436 --> 17:35.036
Well, that's what Lou and I
were talking about.

17:35.104 --> 17:36.839
Well then, start talking
about something else.

17:36.906 --> 17:39.641
'Cause nobody's putting
motorhomes on my land.

17:39.709 --> 17:41.709
What happened to you
not being so involved?

17:41.777 --> 17:43.845
I'm working on it!

17:43.912 --> 17:48.415
But you're sure as hell
not making it easy for me.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.057
That's not bad!

17:58.125 --> 18:00.962
You learn anything
about your horse yet?

18:02.029 --> 18:03.997
You know, I know this
isn't actually about me

18:04.064 --> 18:06.199
watching my horse.

18:06.266 --> 18:09.569
It's about my horse
getting used to me.

18:09.637 --> 18:12.138
You know, for a ten-year-old,
you're pretty smart.

18:12.706 --> 18:16.475
If I'm so smart,
why am I sitting here?

18:17.076 --> 18:18.443
Yeah well, just make sure
you're smart enough

18:18.512 --> 18:21.714
to stay on this side
of the stall.

18:26.586 --> 18:28.120
And I'm gonna have
to reschedule you

18:28.187 --> 18:29.320
<i>for next Tuesday.</i>

18:30.688 --> 18:31.689
Yes.

18:31.757 --> 18:34.993
Yes, I understand rearing
is a serious issue. Uh...

18:35.995 --> 18:39.096
I'm sure Little Trigger
is a lovely horse.

18:39.164 --> 18:41.699
Look, we-w-why don't you
let me see what I can do,

18:41.767 --> 18:43.034
and I'll call you back.

18:43.101 --> 18:45.802
Thanks! Okay.
Hi.

18:45.870 --> 18:47.070
You know, Amy thinks
there's nothing wrong

18:47.138 --> 18:48.104
with Taylor's horse.

18:48.172 --> 18:49.873
Why doesn't
she tell me that,

18:49.941 --> 18:51.307
so I can stop juggling
all the bookings.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.743
<i>You want to get that?</i>

18:52.810 --> 18:54.411
No, just let it go
to message.

18:54.478 --> 18:55.913
All I'm saying is that
it might not be the horse,

18:55.980 --> 18:57.280
but that little girl.

18:57.348 --> 18:58.549
What?

18:58.616 --> 19:00.316
<i>You lied to me!</i>

19:00.384 --> 19:01.884
<i>I hate you!
And Dad hates you, too!</i>

19:01.952 --> 19:03.753
<i>- Taylor!
- That's why he's not coming!</i>

19:03.820 --> 19:05.387
<i>Taylor, please!
You know your father's working!</i>

19:05.455 --> 19:07.857
He'd come
if you'd let him!

19:07.925 --> 19:09.358
It's not a good time
right now.

19:09.426 --> 19:10.993
Okay, look.
Mommy and Daddy both need

19:11.061 --> 19:12.828
to give each other
a little space

19:12.896 --> 19:14.597
to work things out!

19:14.665 --> 19:16.465
Okay?

19:16.533 --> 19:18.767
- Come on.
- I wanna go home!

19:20.736 --> 19:21.903
I'm not sure
what these guys need

19:21.971 --> 19:23.672
is a horse whisperer.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.748
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

19:34.816 --> 19:37.250
I was getting sick
of taking my shower at school.

19:37.318 --> 19:38.752
Well, see?
He's not all that bad.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.087
Yeah. Right.

19:40.154 --> 19:42.056
Come on, maybe Caleb
deserves a break.

19:42.123 --> 19:43.323
Yeah, I mean, you guys
were really good friends,

19:43.391 --> 19:44.758
before, you know,
the whole mom thing.

19:44.826 --> 19:46.660
Okay.
Shut up, both of you.

19:47.762 --> 19:49.629
I know what
you're doing here!

19:49.697 --> 19:52.531
Hello?
Your boyfriend's loft?

19:52.600 --> 19:53.633
Okay, Ash,

19:53.701 --> 19:55.034
that's not what this
is about.

19:55.102 --> 19:56.469
Yeah, I mean,
we're-we're your friends!

19:56.536 --> 19:58.471
Then why don't you start
acting like it?

19:58.538 --> 19:59.706
If you're really
my friends,

19:59.773 --> 20:00.773
then why are you trying
to use me

20:00.841 --> 20:02.508
to get rid of Caleb?

20:02.576 --> 20:06.177
Especially if he's such
a "great guy"!

20:11.651 --> 20:12.450
<i>Hey.</i>

20:13.486 --> 20:14.452
Kate...?

20:16.055 --> 20:19.224
I was, uh...
I was just gonna call you.

20:20.326 --> 20:22.392
This isn't working.
I-I'm sorry,

20:22.460 --> 20:24.895
but this whole trip
has just been a mistake.

20:24.963 --> 20:27.164
Kate, Amy's just
gotten started,

20:27.232 --> 20:28.866
you know, she usually needs
more time...

20:28.934 --> 20:30.134
<i>Yeah, you know what?
I-I just don't think</i>

20:30.201 --> 20:32.269
<i>that Amy understands
the real issue.</i>

20:32.337 --> 20:33.704
We have a problem horse.

20:33.772 --> 20:37.007
And drawing pictures of it
isn't gonna solve anything.

20:37.074 --> 20:40.910
Well, um... you see, Kate,
according to Amy,

20:40.978 --> 20:42.012
there doesn't seem to be
anything wrong

20:42.079 --> 20:43.546
with your horse.

20:44.481 --> 20:47.450
The horse that almost
killed my daughter?

20:47.518 --> 20:48.484
I...

20:48.552 --> 20:49.919
All right, well,

20:49.987 --> 20:52.921
maybe if Amy had spent a month
by Taylor's bedside,

20:52.989 --> 20:54.189
wondering if she's ever
gonna walk again...

20:54.257 --> 20:56.158
Yes, of course.

20:56.225 --> 20:58.393
Obviously something happened,
I'm not denying that.

20:58.461 --> 21:02.097
But your horse seems okay.

21:02.165 --> 21:05.067
Oh, so you think
it's my daughter?

21:05.135 --> 21:07.269
I haven't spent
a lot of time with her,

21:07.336 --> 21:09.937
but she doesn't seem
very happy.

21:10.005 --> 21:12.072
Yeah. Well...

21:12.975 --> 21:14.608
The only thing
that'll make her happy

21:14.677 --> 21:16.544
is if her father and I get
back together,

21:16.611 --> 21:19.714
and that just doesn't seem
very likely.

21:19.782 --> 21:22.283
I had no idea
you're separated.

21:25.887 --> 21:27.387
After the accident,

21:27.454 --> 21:29.956
when Taylor
was in the hospital,

21:30.024 --> 21:31.658
we were both
just too worried about her

21:31.726 --> 21:34.527
to remember that our relationship
was falling apart.

21:34.595 --> 21:35.796
<i>And then we got home,</i>

21:35.863 --> 21:37.664
<i>and Taylor started
to feel better,</i>

21:37.732 --> 21:40.500
and two weeks later,  he...

21:41.232 --> 21:42.500
...walked out.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.241
<i>Did you know
Hershey, Pennsylvania</i>

21:49.309 --> 21:50.743
is one of the top ten
most romantic places

21:50.811 --> 21:51.977
in North America?

21:52.045 --> 21:53.679
That's where they make
those Chocolate Kisses.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.881
I spent this whole study period
in the computer lab.

21:55.949 --> 21:57.215
Okay, well, what
else did you learn?

21:57.282 --> 21:59.450
Well, besides the fact
that there were 500

21:59.518 --> 22:00.985
Taylor Kennedys on Facebook,

22:01.053 --> 22:02.187
only one of which

22:02.254 --> 22:03.154
has Trooper
as her profile picture...

22:03.222 --> 22:04.555
Yes, yes,
besides that!

22:04.623 --> 22:07.726
'Kay, well, she has 216
Facebook "horsey" friends.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.795
And last fall,
she was reserve champion,

22:10.863 --> 22:13.197
<i>and pony hunter
at the Cedarton Fair.</i>

22:13.264 --> 22:15.398
Okay. What about her accident?

22:15.466 --> 22:16.734
Well, there's nothing
really about it.

22:16.801 --> 22:19.737
But there is one picture
with her mom and her dad,

22:19.804 --> 22:21.805
and she's in a full body cast
at the hospital.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.807
But you wanna know
what the weird part is?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.242
It's the only picture
on her wall

22:25.309 --> 22:28.578
where she actually
seems happy.

22:29.613 --> 22:34.117
Okay, so we're just gonna
walk calmly towards your horse.

22:34.184 --> 22:36.886
This is exactly what
my mom told me I couldn't do.

22:36.954 --> 22:39.122
Well, you're with me,

22:39.189 --> 22:41.224
I'm sure your mom
will be fine with it.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.726
Besides, you know Trooper
isn't a bad horse.

22:45.694 --> 22:46.628
I guess.

22:54.270 --> 22:56.704
<i>You know, something must have
really spooked him</i>

22:56.773 --> 23:00.142
to make him run off with you
the way he did.

23:00.209 --> 23:02.609
I don't know.
I didn't do anything.

23:06.748 --> 23:08.348
Horses are really sensitive,

23:08.416 --> 23:12.186
<i>and if you're scared,
or angry, or upset,</i>

23:12.254 --> 23:14.755
<i>then horses are scared
and upset, too.</i>

23:17.691 --> 23:20.026
People do that too,
you know.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.561
They run away from things
that hurt them.

23:22.629 --> 23:24.697
Are you talking about me?

23:27.067 --> 23:30.403
I'm just saying that sometimes,
after a bad accident,

23:30.470 --> 23:33.405
a lot of people
never get on a horse again.

23:34.507 --> 23:35.440
So, are you sure
this is something

23:35.508 --> 23:37.409
<i>that you wanna do?</i>

23:39.179 --> 23:42.881
I used to really love it.

23:44.583 --> 23:47.519
I loved jumping,
and going to shows.

23:52.858 --> 23:55.759
Yeah.
I wanna do it again.

23:56.829 --> 23:57.895
I want to ride Trooper.

24:01.633 --> 24:05.235
Okay. Come on,
let's go get your horse.

24:08.505 --> 24:10.406
Here. I think you know
how to do this.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.176
I do, but...

24:14.979 --> 24:17.314
Don't worry,
I'm gonna be right here.

24:17.381 --> 24:18.315
Just be gentle.

24:26.389 --> 24:30.425
Is there anything you usually
like to say to Trooper?

24:30.493 --> 24:32.895
I don't really talk to him
that much.

24:32.963 --> 24:36.598
I talk to my horses endlessly.
I say all sorts of dumb things.

24:38.968 --> 24:42.370
Well, we do have
a special song.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.973
I learned it at horse camp.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.308
You know, you're not gonna
get very far before dark,

24:47.376 --> 24:49.710
and your room is
just gonna be empty, anyways.

24:49.778 --> 24:51.479
You could stay the night,
get an early start.

24:51.546 --> 24:52.680
Yeah, thanks,

24:52.748 --> 24:54.915
but I think it's best
if we get going.

24:54.983 --> 24:57.150
Okay. I'll print off
your receipt,

24:57.218 --> 25:00.487
and uh, get Ty
to load your horse.

25:02.256 --> 25:05.457
<i>♪ I ride an old paint ♪</i>

25:05.525 --> 25:08.027

25:38.623 --> 25:39.589
And uh,
don't worry,

25:39.657 --> 25:41.725
I didn't charge you
for the wine.

25:41.793 --> 25:44.261
You know, I think
you were right, Lou.

25:44.329 --> 25:46.063
Maybe we should stay
a few more days.

25:46.131 --> 25:48.399

25:54.327 --> 25:55.628
<i>I thought it was bad before.</i>

25:55.695 --> 25:56.863
But now, he spent
half the night

25:56.930 --> 25:58.798
talking about fixing
window screens,

25:58.866 --> 26:01.367
and whether you should use
plastic or metal mesh.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.835
And how bolting them
is better than screwing them.

26:02.903 --> 26:03.870
Ty, Ty!

26:03.937 --> 26:05.337
You can't let him
do it, okay?

26:05.405 --> 26:06.438
What! Why?

26:06.506 --> 26:07.573
Because Ashley knows
it's just about us

26:07.641 --> 26:08.774
getting him out
of the loft!

26:08.841 --> 26:09.775
Yeah, and it's working!

26:09.842 --> 26:12.177
Yes, but Ty,
it can't come from us.

26:12.245 --> 26:14.679
Okay? Caleb has to figure
this out on his own.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.081
If we leave it up to him,

26:16.149 --> 26:18.884
I mean, for all his talk,
he's-he's clueless about girls!

26:18.951 --> 26:20.786
Um, I know this
sounds weird,

26:20.853 --> 26:22.453
but Ashley is my friend,
okay?

26:22.521 --> 26:25.256
And... uh, she made me
feel really bad,

26:25.323 --> 26:28.425
like I was just using her,
or...

26:29.560 --> 26:31.796
All right, I get it.

26:31.863 --> 26:32.863
But I'm the one stuck
living with him.

26:32.931 --> 26:34.598
And his boots.

26:34.666 --> 26:36.133
Come on, Ty.

26:36.201 --> 26:38.368
We just have to stay
out of it, okay?

26:38.436 --> 26:40.569
<i>Hey, Amy!</i>

26:40.637 --> 26:42.638
So, um,
what're we doing today?

26:45.342 --> 26:46.609
Yes, Dad,

26:46.677 --> 26:50.113
no, I realize we've got to do
something about this.

26:50.181 --> 26:51.848
Today?

26:51.916 --> 26:54.851
Okay. Yes,
I'll meet you there.

26:54.919 --> 26:55.918
Yeah, I...I promise.

26:55.985 --> 26:58.553
Look, Dad,
I've got to go. Bye!

26:58.621 --> 26:59.922
Grampa,
what is all this?

26:59.989 --> 27:01.990
Fence panels.

27:02.058 --> 27:03.358
For the new pens.

27:03.426 --> 27:04.827
Okay, well, I hope
you can get them up fast,

27:04.894 --> 27:06.795
'cause I've got three horses
coming in today,

27:06.863 --> 27:08.163
and where am I supposed
to put them?

27:09.598 --> 27:11.333
What are you doing,
Lou?

27:11.400 --> 27:12.700
I thought you
were on Amy's side!

27:12.767 --> 27:15.303
How's she going to handle
all these new horses?

27:15.370 --> 27:16.971
You know what?
I don't know.

27:17.039 --> 27:18.039
I don't know!

27:18.106 --> 27:19.207
I had the whole schedule
worked out,

27:19.274 --> 27:20.842
and then dad came
and screwed everything up!

27:20.909 --> 27:22.043
And now Amy's spending

27:22.110 --> 27:24.111
way too much time
with this little girl,

27:24.179 --> 27:25.213
and you know,
I'm getting all involved

27:25.280 --> 27:26.881
with her mother,
and the...

27:26.949 --> 27:29.149
The problems
with her marriage,

27:29.217 --> 27:31.784
I don't know how anyone
makes a relationship work!

27:31.853 --> 27:33.153
Do you?
'Cause I don't!

27:33.221 --> 27:34.254
And do you know

27:34.322 --> 27:35.956
when the last time
P.W. called me was?

27:36.023 --> 27:38.725
Well, have you tried
calling him?

27:38.792 --> 27:41.995
No! I don't wanna seem
desperate!

27:42.063 --> 27:45.697
Well, maybe if you call him,
you won't be!

27:51.137 --> 27:52.071
Kate! Hey.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.806
What're you doing?

27:54.875 --> 27:56.342
Oh, I'm just expecting
a fax,

27:56.409 --> 27:57.476
I gave them your number.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.611
I just, um...

27:59.679 --> 28:03.214
My husband,
he just filed for divorce.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.216
Oh Kate...
I'm so sorry.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.719
No, I just got off the phone
with my lawyer, so.

28:08.787 --> 28:12.123
I guess there's no sugarcoating
it any longer!

28:12.191 --> 28:14.325
Taylor doesn't know?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.928
Well, I mean, I'm sure
in some way she does.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.697
You know, I just have never
used those words.

28:20.765 --> 28:24.801
Like, separation, divorce.
They just sound so real!

28:24.869 --> 28:28.105
But I guess now,
I just uh...

28:28.172 --> 28:29.572
I guess now,
I don't have any choice.

28:29.640 --> 28:30.941
I'll let you know

28:31.009 --> 28:32.174
as soon as the fax
comes in.

28:32.242 --> 28:33.542
Okay.

28:41.518 --> 28:43.052
<i>Hey, man!</i>

28:43.120 --> 28:44.753
<i>You, uh, remember what
I was telling you about Ashley?</i>

28:44.821 --> 28:46.455
Huh! Yes I do.

28:46.523 --> 28:47.656
Yeah,
that whole handyman thing,

28:47.724 --> 28:49.090
you should just forget
about it, okay?

28:49.158 --> 28:51.226
But that was good advice!

28:51.294 --> 28:53.128
I mean, we might only be talking
about hot water,

28:53.195 --> 28:56.131
but, hey!
At least, we're talking.

28:56.198 --> 28:58.699
Yeah, but, um...
The thing is...

28:58.767 --> 29:00.201
<i>Ashley doesn't buy it.</i>

29:00.269 --> 29:02.170
<i>She thinks that me and Amy,
we're just...</i>

29:02.238 --> 29:04.071
Jerking you around.

29:04.139 --> 29:05.372
Why?

29:06.207 --> 29:09.276
Cause of you living here,
sharing my place.

29:09.344 --> 29:10.677
Oh yeah,
of course.

29:13.348 --> 29:14.315
What're you talking about?

29:16.684 --> 29:17.884
We were trying to get you
to move out of my loft

29:17.953 --> 29:19.119
and back into your trailer.

29:19.187 --> 29:20.119
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

29:21.188 --> 29:22.288
Wow, that's...

29:24.858 --> 29:26.792
What am I supposed to do now?

29:27.360 --> 29:30.229
Don't ask me, man.
And don't fix anything, okay?

29:31.798 --> 29:33.732
<i>Just... let her be.</i>

29:34.268 --> 29:37.402
And you can stay in my loft
as long as you want, okay?

29:37.470 --> 29:41.373
Don't worry about it.
As long as you want.

29:56.021 --> 29:57.821
Oh. My. God.

29:57.889 --> 29:59.156
<i>Hey.</i>

29:59.224 --> 30:01.359
I knew when you saw her,
she'd sell herself.

30:01.426 --> 30:03.227
<i>Yeah...</i>

30:03.295 --> 30:04.996
Dad, I-I don't know.
I mean, this...

30:05.063 --> 30:07.698
This place has a very specific
look to it.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.266
<i>Logs, wood, rocks,
yeah.</i>

30:10.334 --> 30:13.836
More of a nature thing
than an RV thing.

30:13.904 --> 30:15.972
Honey, it's a "strike while
the iron's hot" situation.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.707
This is the perfect solution!

30:17.774 --> 30:19.142
Solution to what, Dad?

30:19.210 --> 30:20.877
I mean, this place
is never gonna be

30:20.944 --> 30:23.779
the Super Six motel,
you know?

30:23.847 --> 30:26.815
Lou, you know I'm doing this
for you girls, right?

30:26.883 --> 30:29.084
I mean, why do you think
I moved back here?

30:29.152 --> 30:30.285
The way things are going,

30:30.353 --> 30:31.853
I don't know how long
I can hang on.

30:35.825 --> 30:40.694
Okay. I get it.
And I'll... think about it.

30:42.398 --> 30:43.697
I promise.

30:43.765 --> 30:45.066
I love you.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.867
I love you too.

30:49.871 --> 30:51.005
I can get a deal on six.

30:52.207 --> 30:53.207
Six?

30:54.309 --> 30:56.243
Lookit. Check it out,
go ahead!

30:56.310 --> 30:57.277
Wow.

31:11.491 --> 31:13.259
You look pretty good
on that horse!

31:13.326 --> 31:16.362
Thanks! That's what
my instructor says too.

31:16.430 --> 31:18.264
Well, maybe we can go
on a trail ride tomorrow.

31:18.331 --> 31:19.598
Why not now?

31:19.666 --> 31:22.768
Well, I'd really rather
not overdo it, okay?

31:22.835 --> 31:24.970
We'll just be careful,
and... we'll take Trooper in,

31:25.038 --> 31:25.904
and Ty can give you
a lift back.

31:25.972 --> 31:27.238
<i>Amy! Amy!</i>

31:27.306 --> 31:29.407
Oh! Easy...

31:29.475 --> 31:30.475
Mallory! What!?

31:30.543 --> 31:31.476
I got a fax!

31:33.245 --> 31:34.479
For Taylor's mom!

31:34.547 --> 31:36.213
Okay,
so give it to Taylor.

31:36.281 --> 31:37.347
But I can't!

31:37.415 --> 31:39.483
Then give it to Ty!

31:39.551 --> 31:41.185
Fine, but this is
the last time

31:41.252 --> 31:42.753
I ever spy on anybody
for you!

31:50.295 --> 31:51.228
There you go!

31:51.296 --> 31:52.195
Okay, thanks.

31:52.262 --> 31:53.329
No problem.

31:53.397 --> 31:55.031
This was the best day
of my life!

31:55.099 --> 31:56.299
Well, who knows?

31:56.366 --> 31:57.767
Tomorrow might be
even better...

31:57.835 --> 31:59.502
- You got it?  - Yep.
- There you go.

31:59.570 --> 32:00.870
- Oh, Taylor!
- Yeah?

32:00.938 --> 32:02.205
Before I forget,
give that to your mom, okay?

32:02.272 --> 32:03.172
- Okay. - Okay
- Cool.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.140
- Okay?
- Thanks!

32:05.209 --> 32:06.109
- Bye!
- See ya!

32:49.864 --> 32:50.864
Hey, Ash!

32:56.970 --> 32:58.937
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

32:59.005 --> 33:00.205
We need your help
here!

33:00.273 --> 33:02.741
Ask Ty, Jack!
He knows.

33:02.809 --> 33:07.012
<i>Took his advice, backed off,
and now, she's calling me.</i>

33:07.080 --> 33:08.847
You sir, are a genius!

33:13.252 --> 33:14.786
Hey, genius.

33:14.853 --> 33:16.921
I've got some advice
for you.

33:16.989 --> 33:18.289
Pick up your end!

33:24.830 --> 33:26.164
Thanks for your help, Mallory.

33:26.231 --> 33:28.064
Don't mention it.
Ever again!

33:29.901 --> 33:32.202
<i>All right. Miss Taylor?
You can do up the girth,</i>

33:32.270 --> 33:35.338
make sure it's nice and tight.

33:38.342 --> 33:39.843
What's wrong?
You okay?

33:39.911 --> 33:41.377
I guess I'm just kinda nervous.

33:41.445 --> 33:44.947
Uh, I haven't been
on a trail since...

33:45.015 --> 33:47.082
Well, don't worry.
We'll just walk, Okay?

33:47.150 --> 33:50.886
If I can even get Roxie
to leave the barn!

33:50.954 --> 33:51.954
And you know,

33:52.022 --> 33:53.622
this isn't gonna
do you any good

33:53.690 --> 33:55.457
if it falls off.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.428
I know you mean well, Dad.
But even you've got to admit,

33:59.495 --> 34:00.628
it makes this place

34:00.696 --> 34:02.030
look like a parking lot
at Walmart!

34:02.097 --> 34:03.832
Oh, you don't have
to sugarcoat it!

34:03.899 --> 34:06.367
So I've got a better idea,
if you would just listen!

34:06.435 --> 34:08.735
We refinance the loan,
and we build another cabin.

34:08.804 --> 34:09.838
- Or two, just...
- No!

34:09.905 --> 34:11.339
- Just right over there!
- Refinance, no.

34:11.406 --> 34:12.540
- Yes!
- No!

34:12.607 --> 34:13.808
Lou, you've done a great job
with the place.

34:13.876 --> 34:15.476
And I-I don't wanna be
a problem!

34:15.543 --> 34:16.643
Oh, come on, Dad.
Don't...

34:16.710 --> 34:18.245
No. If you don't wanna work
with me anymore,

34:18.313 --> 34:20.147
just buy me out!

34:20.215 --> 34:21.181
What?

34:23.684 --> 34:24.484
<i>Lou?</i>

34:26.286 --> 34:27.154
Yeah?

34:27.222 --> 34:28.822
About that fax?

34:28.889 --> 34:31.623
Um... look, as far as I know,
it hasn't come in.

34:31.692 --> 34:33.993
But I'll... I'll call Amy,

34:34.061 --> 34:36.527
and get her to check
the fax machine, okay?

34:43.737 --> 34:44.670
Fax?

34:46.672 --> 34:48.005
I gave it to Ty.

34:48.074 --> 34:50.675
Yeah.
Mallory gave it to Ty.

34:50.743 --> 34:53.277
Okay. I'll be right back.

34:59.418 --> 35:00.618
Hey, Ty?

35:00.686 --> 35:02.520
You know that... that fax?

35:02.588 --> 35:03.688
I gave it to Taylor.

35:04.890 --> 35:06.957
<i>Taylor! No!</i>

35:07.458 --> 35:08.458
Taylor!

35:09.827 --> 35:11.929
<i>I tried to stop her!</i>

35:11.997 --> 35:13.463
Come on, Roxie,
let's go!

35:13.531 --> 35:14.664
Come on, Roxie!

35:14.732 --> 35:16.300
No, please don't do this
right now!

35:16.368 --> 35:18.002
Come on!
Come on, come on!

35:19.170 --> 35:21.938
Come on!! Come on!!

35:25.842 --> 35:27.110
I'm okay!

35:32.682 --> 35:34.717
<i>Taylor, pull up!</i>

35:35.752 --> 35:37.352
Taylor!

35:37.420 --> 35:39.421
Taylor!! Pull up!!

35:39.488 --> 35:40.389
I can't!

35:42.658 --> 35:43.725
<i>Taylor!!</i>

35:44.760 --> 35:46.161
- Taylor!!
- I can't stop!

35:46.229 --> 35:49.932
Taylor!! Pull Up!
There's a cliff!

35:54.002 --> 35:56.203
Taylor! You okay?

35:56.271 --> 35:57.738
Taylor!

35:57.806 --> 35:58.739
Where are you going?

36:01.676 --> 36:03.945
Taylor!!
Stop!

36:04.012 --> 36:05.146
Taylor!

36:05.213 --> 36:08.181
Taylor!
What is your problem?!

36:08.249 --> 36:10.383
Huh?

36:18.725 --> 36:20.193
Morning, Ash.

36:21.295 --> 36:22.228
I'm glad you called.

36:22.296 --> 36:24.296
Who else was I supposed
to call?

36:24.364 --> 36:25.464
What's wrong?

36:25.531 --> 36:27.699
What do you think?
My damn car won't start!

36:27.767 --> 36:29.734
I mean, it's been making
all these funny noises!

36:29.802 --> 36:31.370
I mean, I should've taken it in
months ago,

36:31.438 --> 36:32.671
but do you have any idea
how much it costs

36:32.738 --> 36:34.173
just to open up the hood?

36:34.240 --> 36:35.674
And, now I'm gonna be
late for work,

36:35.741 --> 36:37.343
and Maggie told me
if I'm late one more time,

36:37.410 --> 36:38.543
she's gonna fire me,
and I just--

36:38.611 --> 36:41.745
Hey, just relax.
I'll give you a lift.

36:41.813 --> 36:45.383
Who's gonna be here
for the tow-truck?

36:47.186 --> 36:48.486
Uh, you don't mean...

37:16.146 --> 37:18.247
You know what I think?

37:18.315 --> 37:20.148
I think you did that
on purpose.

37:20.216 --> 37:23.719
No! He just bolted,
like he did the last time!

37:23.786 --> 37:24.953
You made him bolt,
Taylor.

37:25.021 --> 37:26.321
I saw the riding crop
in the barn.

37:26.389 --> 37:28.524
I didn't do anything!

37:29.492 --> 37:31.927
It's your fault!
You say you could fix him,

37:31.995 --> 37:33.762
but you didn't!

37:34.930 --> 37:36.631
You know,
maybe you're right.

37:36.698 --> 37:37.965
And if I can't,

37:38.033 --> 37:38.900
then your mom's just gonna
have to find

37:38.967 --> 37:40.467
a new home for Trooper.

37:40.536 --> 37:43.137
No! You can't tell
my mom.

37:45.106 --> 37:47.441
I didn't mean
to hurt him!

37:48.376 --> 37:51.645
So what exactly
did you mean to do?

37:51.712 --> 37:53.312
I don't know!

37:56.114 --> 37:58.919
They were fighting,
and yelling and...

37:59.787 --> 38:03.456
I just wanted to go fast,
to get away!

38:06.393 --> 38:08.493
Are you talking about
your accident?

38:11.364 --> 38:13.699
When I was in the hospital,

38:13.767 --> 38:16.702
it was just like
it used to be...

38:16.770 --> 38:18.003
With my mom and my dad.

38:19.072 --> 38:21.208
They were together.

38:23.776 --> 38:27.311
Until they got home.
And then... my dad left.

38:31.617 --> 38:33.718
So you wanted
to hurt yourself again?

38:33.786 --> 38:35.186
Like before?

38:36.221 --> 38:38.855
They're getting a divorce!

38:40.725 --> 38:42.960
I just wanted to stop them!

38:44.495 --> 38:48.098
But I swear,
I did not mean to hurt Trooper!

38:49.767 --> 38:53.036
I tried to pull up,
like you said.

38:55.872 --> 38:58.007
But it was too late.

39:16.619 --> 39:18.686
<i>You know, she did it
deliberately, Grampa.</i>

39:18.754 --> 39:20.255
Maybe not even
just this time,

39:20.323 --> 39:21.290
but the other time too,

39:21.357 --> 39:22.524
when she thought
her parents

39:22.591 --> 39:23.658
were gonna split up.

39:23.726 --> 39:26.694
That's how she ended up
in the hospital?

39:26.762 --> 39:28.163
- Yeah.
- Wow.

39:30.732 --> 39:32.166
Taylor begged me
not to tell her mom,

39:32.234 --> 39:33.700
but...

39:33.768 --> 39:35.769
I really think
she needs to know!

39:35.837 --> 39:37.438
Well, it seems like
that little girl

39:37.505 --> 39:38.806
does need help,

39:38.873 --> 39:42.843
and it goes way beyond
help with her horse.

39:45.446 --> 39:48.548
Now, you did the best
you could.

39:50.617 --> 39:52.385
But her mom needs to know
that right now,

39:52.453 --> 39:55.888
that horse might be
the least of her problems.

39:55.957 --> 39:56.923
Hm?

40:04.965 --> 40:08.300
<i>So, what happened
to being partners?</i>

40:08.368 --> 40:10.402
It's not working, Lou.
You know it, and I know it.

40:10.470 --> 40:11.503
Yeah, maybe so,
Dad.

40:11.571 --> 40:12.537
But I'm not gonna
buy you out.

40:18.677 --> 40:22.180
So what am I supposed to do?
Just default and walk away?

40:22.247 --> 40:23.747
Yeah, Dad. Sure.

40:23.815 --> 40:24.949
I guess you could
do that,

40:25.017 --> 40:26.917
if we were
just partners.

40:26.986 --> 40:29.253
But we're not,
we're a family!

40:29.321 --> 40:30.688
And maybe you're a little
bit unclear

40:30.755 --> 40:33.156
on how I feel
about that.

40:34.425 --> 40:37.527
But we've gotta figure
this out.

40:38.162 --> 40:39.329
Look,
worse comes to worse,

40:39.397 --> 40:42.866
I'll carry the payments
for a couple of months.

40:42.933 --> 40:45.135
But one thing is for sure.

40:45.203 --> 40:46.836
I am not gonna to let you
walk out on this family

40:46.904 --> 40:48.238
ever again!

40:52.042 --> 40:53.642
It is pretty ugly,
you know.

40:53.710 --> 40:55.577
Oh, God. It's awful!

40:58.548 --> 40:59.848
Come here.

41:06.522 --> 41:09.790
Hey, Mallory.
I need a favour.

41:11.060 --> 41:14.829
Okay, um...
I didn't listen to you.

41:14.897 --> 41:16.964
And?

41:17.033 --> 41:21.868
And...I really appreciate
everything that you've done.

41:21.936 --> 41:23.570
And?

41:23.638 --> 41:26.473
And... I'm sorry

41:26.541 --> 41:28.708
that sometimes
I take you for granted.

41:28.776 --> 41:30.210
Good enough.
Thank you!

41:30.278 --> 41:31.811
I found this outside the barn.

41:31.879 --> 41:33.680
You know, you should really
put a password on it.

41:33.748 --> 41:35.482
Anyone with half a brain
can figure out

41:35.550 --> 41:37.417
everything about you
in fifteen seconds!

41:37.484 --> 41:38.851
Great.

41:38.919 --> 41:41.087
So, what's the favour?
More spying?

41:41.155 --> 41:42.655
Uh, I need to talk
to Taylor's mom,

41:42.722 --> 41:45.324
and...Taylor cannot know.
