WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:05.818
Now he enriches and strengthens you
by a special sacrament so that you

00:05.820 --> 00:10.538
may assume the duties of marriage
in mutual and lasting fidelity.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.818
And so, in the presence
of the Church,

00:12.820 --> 00:15.778
I ask you to state
your intentions.

00:15.780 --> 00:19.378
Margaret le Broc
and Geoffrey le Broc,

00:19.380 --> 00:20.698
I shall now ask you

00:20.700 --> 00:23.658
if you freely undertake
the obligations of marriage,

00:23.660 --> 00:28.138
and to state that there is no legal
impediment to your marriage.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.898
I wish Granny Betty
were still alive.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.658
She'd put a stop to this.

00:31.660 --> 00:34.458
Your Papa would
want your mother to be happy.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.418
With him? His own brother?

00:36.420 --> 00:40.458
Are you ready,
freely and without reservation,

00:40.460 --> 00:42.940
to give yourselves to each other
in marriage?

00:46.660 --> 00:48.140
Oh! There's a mouse!

00:49.380 --> 00:51.098
Vermin, in the House of the Lord!

00:51.100 --> 00:53.098
Horrid creature.
Thank heavens you saw it.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.940
Someone catch it, it's over there!

00:55.900 --> 00:57.058
I understand how you feel.

00:57.060 --> 00:58.858
But making a scene
won't change anything,

00:58.860 --> 01:01.098
except how your mother
remembers her wedding day.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.980
If there was a mouse,
it's long gone.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.980
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT
I do apologise, Father.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.820
Now, where were we?

01:14.540 --> 01:19.018
Are you ready,
freely and without reservation,

01:19.020 --> 01:21.538
to give yourselves to each other
in marriage?

01:21.540 --> 01:22.580
SOMEONE COUGHS

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.460 --> 01:34.660
I don't think so.

01:36.980 --> 01:38.060
Ned?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.140
Daddy?

02:21.540 --> 02:24.100
I knew you weren't dead,
I knew it.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.060
I don't understand. Where's he been?

02:32.460 --> 02:34.260
You can talk through it at home.

02:36.420 --> 02:39.578
I've been working for
the Secret Intelligence Service.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.738
I'm afraid that's all I can say.

02:41.740 --> 02:42.898
A spy!

02:42.900 --> 02:44.298
Granny Betty was right.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.458
Missing in action doesn't always
mean dead.

02:46.460 --> 02:47.938
Milly, the motor car's waiting.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.580
Ned, you're coming with me.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.498
We were happy. At last.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.898
So why turn up now and destroy it?

02:57.900 --> 02:59.818
It wasn't about you.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.018
I saw Mother's
death notice in the Times.

03:02.020 --> 03:05.818
I was already on my way up and the
new edition announced your wedding.

03:05.820 --> 03:07.178
You didn't waste any time.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.658
You think this was quick to plan?

03:08.660 --> 03:11.418
We had to get
a dispensation from Rome!

03:11.420 --> 03:14.298
And we'd already waited years
so as not to upset our Mother.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.138
She never accepted your death.

03:16.140 --> 03:18.098
Turns out she was right, then, eh?

03:18.100 --> 03:19.378
What do you want, Ned?

03:19.380 --> 03:21.138
My life. My wife.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.338
My inheritance.

03:22.340 --> 03:25.418
You never wanted Meg till it looked
like someone else could have her.

03:25.420 --> 03:28.258
Who do you think's been looking
after your family all these years?

03:28.260 --> 03:29.578
By sleeping with my wife?

03:29.580 --> 03:32.300
- Oh, come on, Ned!
- I say, is he going to be safe?

03:38.420 --> 03:40.298
May I cadge a lift?

03:40.300 --> 03:42.220
Frankly, you should have
stayed dead.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.740
MILLY: Stop! Stop here!

04:04.420 --> 04:05.498
Milly!

04:05.500 --> 04:07.858
Daddy and I can walk back,
he'll want to see it.

04:07.860 --> 04:08.900
Milly!

04:10.060 --> 04:11.498
We'll meet you back at the house.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.660
Sounds good to me.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.860
She's got eight years
to catch up on. Let them go.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.339
At least we'll have a chance to
discuss this mess.

04:25.740 --> 04:28.378
I've kept it tip-top for you.
Grandpa's been showing me how...

04:28.380 --> 04:29.660
DOG BARKS Dinah!

04:30.660 --> 04:32.858
Sorry, she doesn't like strangers.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.220
Hello, old girl. You've grown.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.898
And you.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.858
Haven't been up in years.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.020
Then it's about time.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.300
Well, she's pristine...

04:51.820 --> 04:52.940
...but I'm a little rusty.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.100
Can I tell you a secret?

04:59.580 --> 05:00.618
How dare he?!

05:00.620 --> 05:03.700
- I hate him for this.
- Pull yourself together, man.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.698
Mrs McCarthy has
made our national drink.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.780
What, gin?

05:12.700 --> 05:13.738
Sorry, Father.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.220
I'm in no mood for tea and sympathy.

05:18.540 --> 05:21.578
Forgive me, but you don't seem
particularly pleased to see your son

05:21.580 --> 05:22.660
back from the dead.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.058
Ned's medals.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.138
Awarded posthumously.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.660
War Medal, Defence Medal,
Distinguished Flying Cross.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.578
They ring pretty hollow now.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.098
You don't believe the spy thing.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.180
Not for a second.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.658
Ned's squadron.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.978
Men under my command.

05:40.980 --> 05:44.418
Dead. Dead. Crippled. Dead.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.458
They were real men.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.500
Not pansies who ran away.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.618
MOTOR WHINES DISTANTLY

05:51.620 --> 05:52.660
Welcome him back?

05:53.700 --> 05:57.218
In my day, I'd have shot him myself,
for desertion.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.780
Arthur, is the aircraft supposed
to be up today?

06:08.900 --> 06:10.978
It better be Ned at the controls.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.978
Well, it must be, Milly doesn't
know how to fly.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.418
I've been giving her lessons.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.418
Ned. Bring that thing
down this instant.

06:16.420 --> 06:18.180
Anything you say, Geoffers.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.860
Mary, Mother of...
THEY SCREAM

06:41.500 --> 06:44.300
Oh, God. I'm beginning to see
why you fell for him.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.660
Infuriating, too, of course.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.818
Do you think Milly's all right
up there?

06:50.820 --> 06:51.900
In her element.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.018
She must have a cast-iron stomach.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.058
Makes me queasy just watching.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.098
Ned, you're landing NOW.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.898
Mummy, I'm the pilot, talk to me.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.340
Ned. Now!

07:04.740 --> 07:08.258
Well, if he wasn't dead before,
he's certainly going about it
the right way now.

07:08.260 --> 07:12.218
Who would choose to hang mid-air
in a glorified tin can?

07:12.220 --> 07:14.258
Amy Johnson made it look
so glamorous.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.620
Yes, and then she died.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.380
Good show, good show!

07:34.260 --> 07:37.898
If this is how much care
you take of our daughter I'm glad

07:37.900 --> 07:39.498
you've missed the last eight years.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.258
What is it they say in the flicks?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.060
"You're beautiful
when you're angry."

07:45.340 --> 07:46.538
Milly, go to your room.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.220
- Mummy, I...
- I'll deal with you later.

07:54.780 --> 07:57.418
Don't think I've ever been
this close to an aeroplane before.

07:57.420 --> 07:58.460
Aircraft.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.458
- Aircraft.
- You've never flown?

08:02.460 --> 08:05.978
Father, it's the closest in this
life you can get to meeting God.

08:05.980 --> 08:08.100
Come back another day,
I can take you up.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.020
Not for me, aircraft.

08:12.380 --> 08:14.020
I get wobbly legs on ladders.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.218
Excuse me.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.940
I need a long talk with my husband.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.740
Alone.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.378
What are you doing?

08:30.380 --> 08:34.378
Well, now, your father's going
to sleep in your room tonight.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.778
We've made up a camp-bed for you
in your mother's room.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.217
Oh, we have, have we?

08:39.220 --> 08:41.337
Don't worry.
You'll get your bedroom back soon.

08:41.340 --> 08:45.138
I don't care if I never do,
as long as Daddy stays.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.578
You know,

08:46.580 --> 08:49.420
the situation, is...
- Complicated.

08:50.460 --> 08:53.098
Mummy's always said
she still loves Daddy.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.100
Everything's going to be perfect.
You'll see.

09:01.660 --> 09:03.938
Just let me explain
what happened, why I left.

09:03.940 --> 09:05.378
More spy stories?

09:05.380 --> 09:08.098
There's too much water
under the bridge.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.058
Tell me you don't still love me,

09:10.060 --> 09:11.300
and I will walk away.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.138
Geoffrey's who I've made
my life with.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.620
And you've made another life.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.338
Geoffrey said you were
cheating on me before you left.

09:23.340 --> 09:27.060
Meg, on my life,
I've always been faithful to you.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.980
I'm so sorry I went away.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.858
But I want to be a family with you
and Milly.

09:33.860 --> 09:35.498
We could be happy together again.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.940
- And then one day,
I'll wake up and you'll be gone.
- No.

09:39.060 --> 09:40.860
Let me tell you where I've been
and why.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.498
I'm sorry, Meg.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.460
I was hoping to speak to Ned myself,
before I turn in.

10:03.380 --> 10:04.538
Geoffrey told me...

10:04.540 --> 10:06.980
one time when he was visiting
the base, during the war...

10:08.180 --> 10:10.500
...he saw a woman leaving
Ned's quarters.

10:13.620 --> 10:17.140
Do you think she's the reason
he's been absent for all these years?

10:19.260 --> 10:21.418
So if you know what's good for you,

10:21.420 --> 10:24.338
you'll just vanish off
to wherever you came from,

10:24.340 --> 10:26.900
and we can all get
back to pretending you're dead.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.578
What if I say no?

10:29.580 --> 10:32.378
Then what you've done
will catch up with you.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.498
It's only a matter of time before
they all know you're a deserter.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.700
And why was that?

10:38.740 --> 10:41.898
When I saw that Mother had died,
do you know what I felt first?

10:41.900 --> 10:43.378
Relief.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.058
You can't hold her over me any more.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.458
What's that supposed to mean?

10:46.460 --> 10:47.700
I'm going to tell the truth.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.258
To Meg first, I owe her that but,
ultimately, to everyone.

10:51.260 --> 10:52.700
You wouldn't dare.

10:53.660 --> 10:54.740
Watch me.

11:02.860 --> 11:03.900
Meg.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.938
Can I have a word?

11:06.940 --> 11:07.980
Alone?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.460
I'm tired.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.620
We can talk in the morning.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.618
What are you doing?

11:22.620 --> 11:24.418
Cleaning my gun.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.858
Now?

11:25.860 --> 11:28.620
Your father's just left
the security services.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.100
He might need some protection.

11:32.460 --> 11:33.660
Good to know.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.740
It's been a long day.

11:43.420 --> 11:44.540
I'll see myself out.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.060
Father?

11:51.020 --> 11:52.660
If I said I wanted to come clean...

11:54.260 --> 11:55.460
...make a fresh start...

11:58.180 --> 12:01.900
Confession is always available
to those who truly repent.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.340
So tomorrow morning at nine?

14:18.940 --> 14:20.498
HE SIGHS

14:20.500 --> 14:21.620
CHURCH DOOR CREAKS

14:23.460 --> 14:26.458
Ah, there you are,
I was beginning to worry...

14:26.460 --> 14:29.340
A few wilted carnations
hardly constitutes an emergency.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.460
Ned is three quarters of an hour
late for his confession.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.458
Meg?

14:40.460 --> 14:41.620
Where are you going?

14:42.820 --> 14:44.778
I need to get Milly's pinafore
from her rooms.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.460
No, no. I'll get it for you.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.258
And...

14:49.260 --> 14:51.620
he'll need to find somewhere else
to stay from now on.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.738
What's wrong?

15:01.740 --> 15:02.940
No, don't.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.500
SHE SCREAMS

15:16.420 --> 15:19.060
How does the Padre always
get here first?

15:20.260 --> 15:22.100
Catholics, sir. Last Rites.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.578
Oh, watch that dog, sir,
it's vicious.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.298
I'll take my chances.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.460
Ought to be put down.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.420
Stop smirking and fill me in.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.300
Indulgeat tibi Dominus.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.460
Quid quid visum.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.260
Sive per auditum.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.620
Odortum.

15:50.580 --> 15:51.940
Gustum et locutinem.

15:53.140 --> 15:54.458
Father, is that...?

15:54.460 --> 15:55.620
Tactum.

15:58.740 --> 15:59.900
Gressum deliquisti.

16:06.180 --> 16:08.860
Requiescat in pace. Amen.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.980
His soul is at rest.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.740
We found him in here, Inspector.

16:19.660 --> 16:20.778
As you can see,

16:20.780 --> 16:22.580
we think he must have
killed himself.

16:24.420 --> 16:27.578
Why would a man recently returned
from the grave commit suicide?

16:27.580 --> 16:29.978
He was never terribly stable.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.498
Well...

16:31.500 --> 16:34.778
shot to the temple, gun in his hand.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.140
But no powder burns.

16:37.620 --> 16:38.658
Quite.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.218
It must have been murder.

16:40.220 --> 16:43.618
And from what my sergeant was
telling me of yesterday's events,

16:43.620 --> 16:45.060
we're hardly lacking suspects.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.258
Hello. What's going on...?

16:49.260 --> 16:52.498
No, no, no, he can't be...
No, he can't be dead.

16:52.500 --> 16:56.298
- No, no, Milly.
- No, he mustn't be dead.
- Milly, this is grown-up business.
- What happened?!

16:56.300 --> 16:58.818
GEOFFREY: Please, Milly, come
with me. He's with God now.

16:58.820 --> 17:01.900
Search the house and grounds.
Anything suspicious, bag it up.

17:03.380 --> 17:05.619
I'll need somewhere quiet
to take statements.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.137
That was lipstick.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.900
Who has Ned le Broc
been kissing? Hm?

17:14.780 --> 17:16.738
Perhaps it was Meg's.

17:16.740 --> 17:19.178
Your innocence
is commendable, Father.

17:19.180 --> 17:23.420
But Margaret le Broc
is not a lipstick-wearing woman.

17:36.260 --> 17:37.300
Wing-Commander.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.418
If you ever need to
talk about your grief...

17:43.420 --> 17:45.498
I did my grieving eight years ago.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.260
That's when I lost him, not today.

17:48.820 --> 17:50.698
He was my first-born.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.538
Supposed to follow in my footsteps,

17:52.540 --> 17:55.980
make me proud.
Squadron Leader Edward le Broc.

17:57.180 --> 17:59.060
And then he let me down.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.060
When he deserted.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.698
Why did he do that?

18:05.700 --> 18:08.180
Was he running from something, or...

18:09.580 --> 18:11.258
...to something?

18:11.260 --> 18:13.258
Was there a woman involved?

18:13.260 --> 18:16.018
Well, perhaps the killer was
someone from his other life.

18:16.020 --> 18:18.460
Then why did no-one hear
the gunshot?

18:21.580 --> 18:23.580
You and Ned argued last night.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.820
Are you implying that
I shot my own son?

18:29.260 --> 18:32.018
If I wanted him dead,
I'd have been cleverer than that.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.578
Disconnect the right tube,

18:33.580 --> 18:36.338
this thing would fall out of
the sky, go up in smoke,

18:36.340 --> 18:37.700
the evidence with it.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.458
Father.

18:40.460 --> 18:41.660
Lady Felicia.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.738
Fine. We argued.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.698
But it was about this
Secret Service nonsense.

18:48.700 --> 18:49.938
I mean, you're right.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.098
It was clear to me
that he must've deserted

18:52.100 --> 18:55.258
and I wasn't happy,
but I didn't kill him,

18:55.260 --> 18:57.218
and neither did Geoffrey.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.498
Oh.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.700
That's not what
the inspector thinks.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.378
No, listen to me!

19:04.380 --> 19:05.978
You can't do this, it wasn't him!

19:05.980 --> 19:07.738
I'm telling you, it was suicide!

19:07.740 --> 19:08.818
It was murder!

19:08.820 --> 19:10.578
It must have been someone
out to get him,

19:10.580 --> 19:11.898
cos of his work as a spy.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.338
All right, Miss, I doubt...

19:13.340 --> 19:16.618
I doubt that the security forces
would let your father come home

19:16.620 --> 19:17.978
if he was in danger.

19:17.980 --> 19:19.258
ARTHUR: What are you doing?

19:19.260 --> 19:21.138
It's just for questioning
at this stage.

19:21.140 --> 19:23.058
- Milly, go to your room.
- Why?!

19:23.060 --> 19:25.460
- The grown-ups need to talk.
- Your room. Now.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.780
Sir.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.658
The men found these

19:33.660 --> 19:34.740
down an old well.

19:35.820 --> 19:37.338
- Is that...?
- Blood.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.380
Better still...

19:46.980 --> 19:48.058
He didn't do it.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.740
My son is innocent.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.218
Margaret le Broc,

19:53.220 --> 19:56.458
I am arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Edward le Broc.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.418
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

19:59.420 --> 20:01.658
but anything you do say
will be taken in writing

20:01.660 --> 20:03.140
and may be given in evidence...

20:19.900 --> 20:21.820
I'll call a barrister.
She'll have the best.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.778
Wing-Commander. I've left my holy
oils at the scene. I wonder if...

20:25.780 --> 20:26.820
Be my guest.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.180
There's always something,
unless there's nothing.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.218
Young lady!
You were sent to your room!

20:35.220 --> 20:38.300
- What happened?
- Oh, Milly. I'm so sorry.

20:39.220 --> 20:41.738
- They've arrested your mother.
- Why?

20:41.740 --> 20:45.378
- Well, we don't know yet,
but I'm sure...
- I have to go after them.

20:45.380 --> 20:48.338
Dear, there's nothing...
That's the father's bicycle.

20:48.340 --> 20:49.380
Young lady!

20:58.340 --> 20:59.660
I don't understand.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.778
My men found your clothes,
Mrs le Broc.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.858
What clothes? Where?

21:06.860 --> 21:08.978
The innocent act'd be
a better wheeze

21:08.980 --> 21:11.658
if you'd cut the laundry mark
out of your skirt first.

21:11.660 --> 21:12.900
This is nonsense.

21:13.900 --> 21:14.940
So...

21:15.940 --> 21:18.020
...these aren't yours?

21:20.700 --> 21:22.818
Is that blood?

21:22.820 --> 21:24.458
Are they yours?

21:24.460 --> 21:26.298
I suppose they are.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.498
I haven't seen them in...

21:27.500 --> 21:29.338
Your husband abandoned you,
deceived you,

21:29.340 --> 21:32.178
and then just when you'd put your
life back together, he waltzed in

21:32.180 --> 21:33.898
and ruined your new marriage.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.178
So you killed him
and tried to set it up as suicide.

21:36.180 --> 21:39.618
- No!
- You moved the body,
your clothes were bloodied,

21:39.620 --> 21:40.818
and you hid the evidence.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.778
No! I'd taken sleeping pills.

21:42.780 --> 21:44.658
I was out cold.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.460
You realise we'll test that?

21:47.620 --> 21:49.298
Someone's framing me.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.098
I haven't seen these clothes
in years!

21:52.100 --> 21:55.020
You'll have to do better than that
to wriggle out of this one.

22:03.220 --> 22:04.340
Bingo.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.738
Cash, passport.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.260
That doesn't tell us anything.

22:18.940 --> 22:21.058
"Please don't tell."

22:21.060 --> 22:22.298
Please don't tell what?

22:22.300 --> 22:24.058
It's not a request. It's a bar.

22:24.060 --> 22:25.378
Father!

22:25.380 --> 22:27.658
That Milly le Broc has just
stolen your bicycle!

22:27.660 --> 22:29.098
- What?
- Why?

22:29.100 --> 22:31.538
She has some notion that she can
help her mother.

22:31.540 --> 22:33.138
She shouldn't be on her own.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.498
I told her uncle
and he ran after her.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.858
But, Father, your bicycle!

22:37.860 --> 22:38.900
It's survived worse.

22:40.060 --> 22:42.098
But...

22:42.100 --> 22:43.978
I will need a lift to this bar.

22:43.980 --> 22:46.138
I can lend you Hornby and the Rolls.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.978
I promised the Wing-Commander
I'd visit Meg, keep her spirits up.

22:48.980 --> 22:50.018
Then you must.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.698
Father, this bar,

22:51.700 --> 22:52.818
it's a trifle racy.

22:52.820 --> 22:55.100
- And...
- My faith will be my shield.

22:56.420 --> 22:58.940
You shall not enter
the lions' den alone.

23:00.060 --> 23:01.340
Good luck with that.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.258
How'd you get here?

23:06.260 --> 23:08.938
I took the Father's bicycle.
I'm going to give it back.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.498
- You did what?
- Listen to me.
My mother is innocent.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.418
I know she didn't leave
the room last night.

23:13.420 --> 23:14.818
Awake all night, were you?

23:14.820 --> 23:16.058
I'd have heard if she'd gone.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.098
She could've slipped out
while you slept.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.938
As an alibi, it doesn't wash.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.618
- Sergeant!
- Inspector.

23:21.620 --> 23:23.060
I have important new evidence.

23:24.540 --> 23:25.938
Why didn't you say so earlier?

23:25.940 --> 23:26.978
I saw a woman

23:26.980 --> 23:28.338
at the house, last night.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.380
When?

23:30.540 --> 23:31.778
I don't know,

23:31.780 --> 23:34.458
perhaps two in the morning?

23:34.460 --> 23:37.180
I heard a car and looked out
of the window, and she was there.

23:38.220 --> 23:39.498
You just got up.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.618
Were your glasses on?

23:41.620 --> 23:44.818
- Well, no, but...
- How clearly can you
see without them?

23:44.820 --> 23:46.138
I saw her!

23:46.140 --> 23:48.778
There was a car, and then this
woman, coming up the drive

23:48.780 --> 23:50.898
and then heading round
to the balcony stairs

23:50.900 --> 23:52.138
that lead up to my room.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.418
Daddy's room.

23:53.420 --> 23:55.818
Why didn't you do something? Shout?

23:55.820 --> 23:58.260
I tried to wake Mummy,
but she'd taken those stupid pills.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.218
And I was scared.

24:01.220 --> 24:02.860
I hate myself for not stopping her.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.898
It was that woman who
killed my father, Inspector.

24:06.900 --> 24:09.498
If this conveniently unknown woman
had come into the house

24:09.500 --> 24:10.658
in the dead of night,

24:10.660 --> 24:12.900
that blasted dog
of yours would've gone ballistic.

24:14.380 --> 24:15.700
Did you hear a peep?

24:18.620 --> 24:21.380
Wasting police time
won't help your mother.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.980
The uncle's just arrived,
all hot and bothered.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.858
You'd better get
the Padre's bicycle back.

24:29.860 --> 24:32.500
And give the pair of them a lift
while you're at it.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.578
I don't understand.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.980
Where is the door?

24:44.500 --> 24:46.340
We could telephone for directions?

24:51.660 --> 24:52.820
Thank you.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.538
Hello, operator?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.258
Good morning.
What number do you want?

25:09.260 --> 25:12.138
Oxford 2526 please.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.778
Hold on while I connect you.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.060
DIALLING TONE

25:17.180 --> 25:18.498
'Please Don't Tell.'

25:18.500 --> 25:19.658
I won't.

25:19.660 --> 25:20.820
'Is this the delivery?'

25:22.500 --> 25:24.658
The delivery. Yes, that's right.

25:24.660 --> 25:26.858
- That's right.
- 'Password please.'

25:26.860 --> 25:27.900
Password?!

25:30.100 --> 25:31.418
It's slipped my mind.

25:31.420 --> 25:37.058
Hello?
We have a very busy schedule today.

25:37.060 --> 25:41.018
So we can leave your stock on
the street, or we can bring it in.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.620
It's entirely up to you.

25:43.820 --> 25:45.940
'You know this isn't how it's
supposed to work.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.820
'Fine. I'll give you a hint.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.540
'Bone of my bones.'

25:53.460 --> 25:55.618
(Bone of my bones?)

25:55.620 --> 25:56.698
Well, this isn't...

25:56.700 --> 25:57.860
This is a very funny bar.

25:59.380 --> 26:00.580
(Of course!)

26:02.020 --> 26:03.300
Adam's rib.

26:05.420 --> 26:06.900
And what's that supposed to mean?

26:16.060 --> 26:17.340
You can leave the crates.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.538
Well!

26:22.540 --> 26:24.258
Don't you look a picture!

26:24.260 --> 26:27.098
You didn't need to fake
a delivery to come in here, love.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.218
I want the address of your tailor.

26:29.220 --> 26:33.260
Well, I do happen to have a very
good draper in Chipping Norton.

26:34.780 --> 26:36.098
Oh.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.140
A priest.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.818
That'll teach me
to give out clues.

26:40.820 --> 26:41.860
Father Brown.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.138
Apologies for the subterfuge.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.658
You're going to have to leave.

26:47.660 --> 26:50.618
Young lady,
when someone introduces themselves,

26:50.620 --> 26:53.338
it's only polite to reciprocate.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.140
I am Mrs McCarthy.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.660
You can call me Jackie.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.858
Hello, Jackie.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.020
Pleased to meet you.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.340
We think we know
a customer of yours.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.100
Might have been here recently.

27:13.460 --> 27:14.500
Have you seen him?

27:15.740 --> 27:16.778
Perhaps with a woman?

27:16.780 --> 27:18.540
JACKIE CHUCKLES No.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.940
I've never seen
a man like that in here.

27:26.940 --> 27:29.140
Thank you... Jackie.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.058
You've been very helpful.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.218
Well ask her some more!

27:34.220 --> 27:36.018
Sure, that's no help at all.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.980
I've got everything I need.

27:56.740 --> 27:57.780
KNOCK AT DOOR

28:05.580 --> 28:08.258
I know what you
and Ned argued about last night.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.298
I've told you.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.018
I was angry that he'd deserted.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.180
No, you weren't.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.818
I've been to the bar
Ned used to go to.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.618
I know the identity of the woman

28:18.620 --> 28:20.980
Geoffrey saw leaving Ned's
quarters in the war.

28:22.020 --> 28:24.138
I know whose lipstick
was on Ned's mouth.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.378
Father, please don't.

28:26.380 --> 28:29.258
When did you first learn your
that elder son

28:29.260 --> 28:30.860
preferred to dress as a woman?

28:33.180 --> 28:36.460
He deserted the RAF,
and faked his own death.

28:38.420 --> 28:41.020
- Was that because you found out?
- That's ridiculous!

28:42.740 --> 28:47.220
You forced
your beloved eldest son into hiding.

28:48.620 --> 28:52.818
YOU made him abandon his wife

28:52.820 --> 28:54.218
and five-year-old daughter.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.780
You're ready with the judgment,
aren't you, Father?

28:58.300 --> 28:59.940
His mother was already sick.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.298
If she'd known what he did, what
he was,

29:04.300 --> 29:05.738
it would have killed her.

29:05.740 --> 29:06.780
And now...

29:08.460 --> 29:11.980
...keeping Ned's secret
may leave Meg to hang.

29:15.140 --> 29:18.458
This is information
that I must pass on

29:18.460 --> 29:21.980
so the Inspector has a chance
to find the real killer.

29:23.340 --> 29:24.380
No.

29:25.940 --> 29:28.338
I'll go to Inspector Mallory myself.

29:28.340 --> 29:29.580
- Why?
- To confess.

29:32.620 --> 29:33.938
- You're the murderer?
- Yes.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.180
I am.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.300
Then how do you explain
Meg's bloody clothing?

29:40.900 --> 29:43.298
I used them to mop up the blood

29:43.300 --> 29:45.220
and then I panicked
and I threw them away.

29:46.540 --> 29:47.818
Why shoot him?

29:47.820 --> 29:50.978
You said yourself that the aircraft
would be the perfect murder weapon.

29:50.980 --> 29:52.458
Because there was no time.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.818
I had to protect my family
from the truth.

29:54.820 --> 29:56.020
And I still do.

29:57.780 --> 29:59.780
If you promise to keep
Ned's secret...

30:01.300 --> 30:03.380
...I'll go and admit it all
right now.

30:09.060 --> 30:10.700
Well, I just can't believe it.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.898
Someone's going to have to
tell Milly.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.778
I think we should leave
it to the family.

30:19.780 --> 30:20.900
Where's Father off to?

30:22.740 --> 30:23.940
Can I have a word?

30:29.740 --> 30:30.780
Milly, can we...?

30:31.780 --> 30:33.498
Why didn't you bark?

30:33.500 --> 30:34.940
You silly, silly dog.

30:36.580 --> 30:37.860
The one time it's important.

30:41.980 --> 30:44.138
I'd watch that little girl, Father.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.058
She's only been over to see
the inspector,

30:46.060 --> 30:48.500
with some tall tale about a woman
breaking in last night.

30:49.540 --> 30:50.780
World on her shoulders.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.140
DOG BARKS

31:07.660 --> 31:08.700
What is it?

31:10.980 --> 31:13.458
- Where's Milly?
- She ran off.
I think she wanted to be alone.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.698
I just tried explaining
about her grandfather,

31:15.700 --> 31:18.100
but she didn't take the news very
well, I'm afraid.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.778
Please! Stop!

31:24.780 --> 31:26.258
Milly, stop!

31:26.260 --> 31:27.458
Out of my way.

31:27.460 --> 31:28.538
Let me talk to you.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.660
I'm not getting out.

31:36.660 --> 31:37.740
Then I'll get in.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.500
HE CHUCKLES

31:47.700 --> 31:51.338
You will do me a very great favour
if we go no higher than this.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.818
You don't understand. I have to
get to the police station.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.418
I understand more
than you could imagine.

31:56.420 --> 31:57.658
No!

31:57.660 --> 31:58.778
Where will you land?

31:58.780 --> 32:01.620
There's a flat field behind the
butcher's that'll do in a pinch.

32:03.060 --> 32:04.298
I know what happened, Milly,

32:04.300 --> 32:07.018
and I am not going to let you make
a confession too.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.418
I've only kept quiet this long

32:08.420 --> 32:10.698
because Grandpa promised Mummy
would be let go soon.

32:10.700 --> 32:13.218
Now he's put himself in danger too.

32:13.220 --> 32:15.418
I don't understand why he's
shielding that woman.

32:15.420 --> 32:16.458
He has his reasons.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.378
And what could they possibly be?

32:18.380 --> 32:19.978
My father's murderer is dead.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.538
I know.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.660
I killed her.

32:25.620 --> 32:28.220
When I did it, of course,
I thought I was saving Daddy.

32:29.140 --> 32:32.460
Maybe saving all of us.
Who knows what she came to do?

32:37.860 --> 32:40.938
I tried to wake Mummy,
but she'd taken those stupid pills.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.460
Mummy. Mummy!

32:52.340 --> 32:53.820
LOUD RATTLING

33:17.380 --> 33:18.858
But I was too late.

33:18.860 --> 33:20.538
She'd already killed him.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.578
Daddy?

33:21.580 --> 33:22.618
DOG WHINES

33:22.620 --> 33:25.818
What's going on in there?
Father? Milly...

33:25.820 --> 33:27.058
Milly, what have you done?

33:27.060 --> 33:28.338
She was coming in the window.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.500
She was after Daddy.

33:30.740 --> 33:31.778
What do we do?

33:31.780 --> 33:32.818
Er...

33:32.820 --> 33:34.778
Right, I'll deal with this.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.658
Keep Milly quiet,
get her back to her bed.

33:36.660 --> 33:37.700
DOG WHINES

33:38.860 --> 33:40.778
What about Daddy?
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

33:40.780 --> 33:42.540
Sh, please, don't worry about him.

33:44.180 --> 33:46.018
You just shot someone, Milly.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.698
We have to protect you now.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.180
You can't tell anyone about this.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.420
Here, take it. Take it.

34:02.580 --> 34:05.220
If nothing else, Daddy's killer
got what she deserved.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.978
You must not
tell the inspector this.

34:16.980 --> 34:18.018
Why not?

34:18.020 --> 34:20.058
At least if I confess to killing
the woman,

34:20.060 --> 34:21.578
Mummy and Grandpa will be let go

34:21.580 --> 34:25.178
because Inspector Mallory will know
who really murdered my father.
- Yes.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.219
Yes, he will.

34:31.300 --> 34:35.260
Please, Milly, you have to stop this.
It isn't safe.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.780
We can talk about this,
sort it out on the ground.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.020
Please!

34:43.900 --> 34:46.460
Milly, this is a really bad idea.

34:48.300 --> 34:50.858
How can you prove that this woman
even existed?

34:50.860 --> 34:53.378
Grandpa must've hidden her body
somewhere.

34:53.380 --> 34:54.780
The police will find it.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.298
Well, what if they don't?

34:57.300 --> 34:59.618
They have dogs for that
sort of thing, don't they?

34:59.620 --> 35:01.378
They'll sniff it out.

35:01.380 --> 35:03.778
I'm amazed Dinah hasn't
been making such a fuss.

35:03.780 --> 35:04.860
Yes.

35:06.700 --> 35:10.458
In fact, it's funny that she didn't
bark at the woman

35:10.460 --> 35:11.820
in the first place.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.378
Maybe she was asleep.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.940
She was right there next to me.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.898
If this conveniently unknown woman
had come into the house

35:24.900 --> 35:26.098
in the dead of night,

35:26.100 --> 35:28.420
that blasted dog of yours
would've gone ballistic.

35:30.540 --> 35:31.698
Dinah!

35:31.700 --> 35:33.058
Did you hear a peep?

35:33.060 --> 35:35.500
Hello, old girl. You've grown.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.378
I don't understand.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.740
If it was him, if it was me...

35:45.420 --> 35:47.178
...why was he dressed like that?

35:47.180 --> 35:49.660
Was it something to do with him
being a spy?

35:50.900 --> 35:55.658
Milly, this takes nothing
away from who your father was.

35:55.660 --> 35:56.980
I don't understand.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.498
Milly.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.660
Let's land this plane
and talk it through.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.220
It's all my fault.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.220
It's my fault.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.218
Milly,

36:16.220 --> 36:17.738
please,

36:17.740 --> 36:18.780
get us down.

36:20.660 --> 36:21.938
Please, listen.

36:21.940 --> 36:24.258
Milly, we are thousands of feet up.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.300
I need you to land this thing.

36:34.020 --> 36:35.060
Erm...

36:36.100 --> 36:37.500
Mayday. Mayday.

36:38.740 --> 36:41.218
- Pilot incapacitated.
- She's frozen on the stick.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.258
Surely there's someone
who can talk him down?

36:43.260 --> 36:45.618
I suppose I've been up with him
enough times.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.738
Father Brown, this is Geoffrey here.

36:47.740 --> 36:51.858
Erm... yes. I'm going to have to
give you a crash course in landing.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.458
That's not funny.

36:53.460 --> 36:55.780
So, can you see
your air speed indicator?

36:56.900 --> 36:58.018
I expect so.

36:58.020 --> 36:59.178
Which one is it?

36:59.180 --> 37:01.658
It's the big dial in the middle.

37:01.660 --> 37:04.180
Make sure you keep the needle
above 60, or you'll stall.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.898
The throttle is
the lever on your left.

37:07.900 --> 37:09.100
Righty-ho.

37:13.580 --> 37:16.258
For though I walk in the midst
of the shadow of death...

37:16.260 --> 37:18.818
ENGINE GROWLS SUDDENLY
No, no, no! More throttle!

37:18.820 --> 37:21.260
Keep it at 1,500 revs
on your left hand dial.

37:22.220 --> 37:23.338
I see.

37:23.340 --> 37:24.458
Excellent.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.260
- You can do this.
- Are you sure about that?

37:28.140 --> 37:29.818
Now keep your right hand
on the stick.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.898
That's it, that's it.
You're coming in to land.

37:31.900 --> 37:32.978
I am?

37:32.980 --> 37:35.258
Hail Mary, full of Grace,
the Lord is with thee.

37:35.260 --> 37:38.178
Keep the wings level
and push your nose down.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.898
Now ease back on the throttle.

37:39.900 --> 37:40.978
Steady!

37:40.980 --> 37:42.138
Steady!

37:42.140 --> 37:43.460
Ease the stick back.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.740
No! Slowly! DUCK!

37:57.980 --> 38:01.138
And He ascended upon the cherubim,
and He flew.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.420
He flew upon the wings of the winds.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.338
I'm sorry, Wing-Commander.

38:07.340 --> 38:10.498
I've spoken to the Chief Inspector
and he's with me on this one.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.578
We can't accept your confession.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.138
But you have to.

38:14.140 --> 38:17.498
It's plain as a pikestaff you're
covering for your daughter-in-law.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.538
It's just as well you're friends
with the chief

38:19.540 --> 38:22.258
or I'd be locking you up
for wasting police time!

38:22.260 --> 38:23.418
Padre.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.978
Like a bad penny.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.938
- I've come to offer
the Wing-Commander confession.
- Oh.

38:27.940 --> 38:29.740
Do it while you escort him home.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.060
- You're letting him go?
- He still thinks it was Meg.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.498
Milly knows everything.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.898
As do I.

38:36.900 --> 38:40.738
She wanted to come down here herself.
I managed to convince her otherwise

38:40.740 --> 38:43.418
as long as I could bring you
and her mother home.

38:43.420 --> 38:44.780
I've done everything I can do.

38:45.860 --> 38:47.020
I have an idea.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.300
Inspector.

38:51.500 --> 38:55.338
Erm, have you asked Mrs le Broc
to try on the clothes?

38:55.340 --> 38:58.620
- What?
- No!
- The clothes
that she was allegedly wearing.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.620
Have you seen her with them on?

39:04.940 --> 39:08.220
- But they're covered in blood.
Must I really?
- Yes. You must.

39:13.420 --> 39:15.260
Sir. Blood results.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.378
It's true. She took enough
barbiturates last night

39:19.380 --> 39:20.978
to sink a rhino.

39:20.980 --> 39:24.220
She could've still taken them
just after she did the murder.

39:25.260 --> 39:28.178
Then she wouldn't have been up to
discover the body at quarter to ten.

39:28.180 --> 39:31.538
She's off the hook. So stop this
charade before he realises.

39:31.540 --> 39:32.580
KNOCKING

39:36.500 --> 39:38.138
I can't even do the skirt up.

39:38.140 --> 39:41.498
I'd say I've put on weight,
but the jacket's been let out,

39:41.500 --> 39:43.058
it hangs off me.

39:43.060 --> 39:45.500
Someone else was wearing those
clothes last night.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.538
And I know who it was!

39:48.540 --> 39:49.978
Who?

39:49.980 --> 39:52.058
The person your daughter saw.

39:52.060 --> 39:54.178
Someone with broad shoulders,
slim hips.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.098
She saw them climbing
through the window.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.738
- She was afraid, she wanted
to intervene...
- No, Inspector.

39:58.740 --> 40:00.258
...and if only she had.

40:00.260 --> 40:02.858
Or your husband's fancy-woman
wouldn't have shot him

40:02.860 --> 40:05.180
for coming back to you.
See, I can see it now.

40:06.460 --> 40:08.018
They argued.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.818
Maybe he'd already got his
father's gun for self-defence,

40:10.820 --> 40:12.538
she grabbed it off him.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.020
The things we do for love.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.260
Must've been a funny-looking girl.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.700
Still... each to his own.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.858
I don't understand.

40:23.860 --> 40:25.298
You're free to go.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.738
Goodfellow, write this up.

40:26.740 --> 40:29.098
Would you like us
to start a search, sir?

40:29.100 --> 40:30.818
Waste of manpower.

40:30.820 --> 40:31.860
She's long gone.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.140
Grandpa said I'd find you here.

40:51.780 --> 40:56.180
- Milly, I don't think
it's a very good idea...
- Why is it your weddings
always happen just after a funeral?

40:58.300 --> 40:59.340
Well...

41:00.700 --> 41:04.338
- Your mother wanted to keep it
low-key, so...
- Even from me?

41:04.340 --> 41:05.578
Doesn't she trust me,

41:05.580 --> 41:07.978
after everything we've
been through together?

41:07.980 --> 41:09.180
I trust you.

41:10.540 --> 41:11.620
Do you?

41:14.740 --> 41:15.938
Milly?

41:15.940 --> 41:18.698
Silly Mummy. I have to be here.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.258
Grandpa agrees with me.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.500
I'm the one who should be
giving you away this time.

41:27.940 --> 41:30.180
Much later, and there'd be
nothing left to witness!

41:32.020 --> 41:34.418
My word, that woman has style.

41:34.420 --> 41:35.858
Smashing hat.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.698
It's that barmaid from the...

41:37.700 --> 41:39.458
drinking den.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.940
- Oh, my. It was that sort
of drinking den.
- Hm?

41:44.420 --> 41:45.780
(He's a man!)

41:52.340 --> 41:54.540
Margaret le Broc
and Geoffrey le Broc...

41:56.740 --> 41:58.498
...I shall now ask you

41:58.500 --> 42:01.778
if you freely undertake
the obligations of marriage,

42:01.780 --> 42:05.180
and to state there is no legal
impediment to your marriage.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.418
Are you ready,

42:10.420 --> 42:14.018
freely and without reservation,

42:14.020 --> 42:17.538
to give yourselves to each other

42:17.540 --> 42:18.820
in marriage?

42:27.180 --> 42:28.220
BOTH: I am.
