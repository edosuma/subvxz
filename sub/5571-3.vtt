00:07.274 --> 00:09.341
¶ ¶

00:12.246 --> 00:14.279
(music stops, indistinct
conversation nearby)

00:16.117 --> 00:17.416
Man:
Whoa, hey.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.650
Man (Laughs): Whoa.
Woman (Laughs): Oop. Sorry.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.070
Man:
I will pay back.
Hey.

00:21.071 --> 00:23.489
Hey. Put in a little extra
time after Liberty call?

00:23.491 --> 00:25.457
New kid at the office,
trying to score points.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.792
Oh, don't worry.
You're doing great.
Thank you.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.460
I hear we're on
for burgers Saturday.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.030
Can't wait.

00:35.669 --> 00:36.635
How you doing,
sweetheart?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.637
Hey, honey.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.140
Hello.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.446
Good day?
Great.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.314
Good.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.682
(Children shouting
playfully in distance)

00:50.684 --> 00:52.735
(Dog barking)
Woman: We're done.

00:52.736 --> 00:54.787
(Man and woman
conversing indistinctly)

01:00.628 --> 01:02.394
Man:
Let's go.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.430
(Laughing):
Wait! Watch it!

01:04.432 --> 01:06.065
Woman:
I'm sorry...

01:06.067 --> 01:07.833
Bishop:
Sweetheart? Really?

01:07.835 --> 01:09.601
Well, I've been stuck
in here all day.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.503
She hasn't
gone anywhere.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.404
Okay, I thought you were gonna
call before you left the office,

01:13.407 --> 01:14.840
so I could have dinner
ready for us.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.743
I'm not hungry... honey.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.379
(Woman shrieks,
both shouting playfully)

01:22.183 --> 01:24.750
They sure don't<i> look </i>
like murderers.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.553
(Ship's horn blowing)
Bishop:
<i> How far is it</i>

02:01.555 --> 02:03.856
from the airport
to the resort?

02:03.858 --> 02:07.192
Great. Uh, the earlier
the flight, the better.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.562
Thanks. I will e-mail you
the credit card information.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.831
Okay.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.300
Taking a trip?
Yeah.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.369
To, uh, St. John
in the Virgin Islands.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.905
I'm gonna use a day of leave
for a long weekend.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.408
Oh, nice.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.910
Yeah. Jake and I could
use a little alone time.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.246
A beautiful white
Sandy beach

02:27.248 --> 02:29.381
and drinks with little umbrellas

02:29.383 --> 02:31.250
will hopefully
stimulate conversation.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.318
I totally understand.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.887
Relationships take work.

02:34.889 --> 02:38.257
After hearing what Tony and Zoe
are going through, I felt like

02:38.259 --> 02:40.926
we should do something sooner
rather than later.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.295
What are Tony and Zoe
going through?
You know,

02:43.297 --> 02:44.796
they're having a rough patch.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.265
Who told you that?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.432
Tony did.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.301
He told<i> you?</i>

02:49.303 --> 02:50.903
(Laughing):
Hey.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.337
Good morning,

02:52.339 --> 02:53.739
my attractive co-workers.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.574
How are you on this

02:55.576 --> 02:57.743
glorious fall day?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.511
Hey, Tony.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.548
Ooh.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.715
Moody.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.883
Well, I'm doing great.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.285
Today is the day

03:06.287 --> 03:07.719
that I will
receive the results

03:07.721 --> 03:10.289
from trackmydna.Com.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.623
Hmm. What's that?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.858
It's an ancestry service.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.393
You spit in a vial,

03:14.395 --> 03:15.861
you send it to 'em, and then,

03:15.863 --> 03:18.263
two weeks later,
they e-mail you your ethnic

03:18.265 --> 03:19.665
and ancestral makeup.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.732
Fascinating.
Bishop:
Cool.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.633
Why'd you do it?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.602
'Cause it's fascinating.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.372
And also, you know,

03:27.374 --> 03:30.309
been thinking a lot
about family.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.311
You know, who I am,

03:32.313 --> 03:34.813
down deep in the genes.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.816
Why I am the way I am.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.751
Don't you think that's
a good idea, McGee?

03:39.753 --> 03:42.854
Oh, I'm sorry.
You want<i> my</i> advice?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.289
(Laughs)

03:44.291 --> 03:46.959
That guy. Well,

03:46.961 --> 03:50.762
remember my old British uncle
clive, my mother's side?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.965
Yeah. The, uh, old geezer
who left his estate

03:52.967 --> 03:55.334
to your cousin crispian,
instead of you.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.703
Yeah. Well, that's water
under the London bridge.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.905
Anyway, old clive used to insist

03:59.907 --> 04:03.508
that we were somehow related
to British royalty.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.344
And if that is true,

04:05.346 --> 04:08.847
the two of you shall refer to me
only as "lord Anthony."

04:08.849 --> 04:10.282
Good luck with that.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.351
You're with me, lord.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.653
(With British accent):
Where we off to, guv?
Quantico.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.423
Keep talking with that
accent, I'm gonna shoot you.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.692
(Slowly, without accent):
Why are we going there?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.327
Got a call from
major Newton last night.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.762
He would like to see us.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.663
Who's major Newton?

04:24.665 --> 04:25.831
Major Sussex Newton.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.366
Marine mp stationed
at camp lejeune.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.533
We worked with him

04:28.535 --> 04:29.768
on a case a couple
of years ago.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.770
Theft of munitions
from the base armory.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.505
We arrested a gunny
for a crime.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.973
He was prosecuted,
convicted and

04:34.975 --> 04:36.975
is serving time in leavenworth.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.978
Newton. Remember that?
He wouldn't let go of it?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.480
Good old newty.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.015
He was convinced
there was an accomplice.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.383
(Mock evil laughter)

04:44.385 --> 04:45.984
Trust me, there's no accomplice.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.352
McGee:
He called in

04:47.354 --> 04:49.054
several leads
over the last two years.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.355
None of 'em panned out.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.523
What's Newton doing at Quantico?

04:51.525 --> 04:52.991
He's teaching.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.458
Week of military law enforcement
classes at basic.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.862
This is gonna be a
waste of time, trust me.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.397
Why don't you
take McGee?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.065
He's in a bad mood.
He could use the ride.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.367
Hey, come on, let's go.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.869
See you later, lord fauntleroy.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.804
Bye.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.710
Major Newton,
NCIS wannabe.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.679
I bet when his service
obligation's up,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.414
he applies to
the agency.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.416
He already has.
Used me as a reference.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.518
Well, that's interesting. Hmm.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.053
I understand.
Excuse me.

05:21.055 --> 05:24.022
You, too, sir.
Suzy?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.359
Okay.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.594
Well, I can't wait
to, uh, hear

05:29.596 --> 05:31.997
what major Newton has
in store for us this time.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.565
Drop it.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.634
Bye.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.739
What can I do for you?

05:40.741 --> 05:44.076
Major Sussex Newton-- what room
is he staying in, please?

05:44.078 --> 05:45.744
Why are you asking?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.046
NCIS.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.048
He's expecting us.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.484
Oh. Um,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.619
I guess it's all right
to tell you. Uh...

05:54.621 --> 05:56.488
That call was
from base security.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.557
They just found
the major's body.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.692
He's dead.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.597
(Indistinct
radio communication)

06:13.741 --> 06:16.775
Gibbs:
Don't move that body!

06:16.777 --> 06:19.544
Wasn't gonna.
Who are you?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.881
NCIS.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.449
Secure the area.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.051
Man:
We just found the body.

06:26.053 --> 06:26.918
Who called you?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.121
Major Newton.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.771
(Camera shutter clicking)

06:45.773 --> 06:48.073
(Siren blaring,
indistinct radio communication)

06:48.075 --> 06:49.975
You realize if
Tony finds out

06:49.977 --> 06:52.878
he has an ounce of royal blood
running through his veins,

06:52.880 --> 06:55.013
there will be no
living with him.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.915
There's no living with him now.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.450
Doubt we'll find anything.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.919
This place is used
by hundreds of people a day--

07:00.921 --> 07:03.889
hikers, joggers,
horseback riders.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.457
Excuse me, agent McGee?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.092
Yeah.
Anything I can
do to help?

07:07.094 --> 07:09.027
Just secure the perimeter.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.565
I just assumed he stumbled
and fell down the hill.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.833
Is there something I missed?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.835
Well, no.
Looks like an accident.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.904
We're just being thorough.

07:21.642 --> 07:25.710
Hey. Only items on his body
were his voq room card,

07:25.712 --> 07:29.114
a fitness bracelet
and cell phone.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.783
Last call was to you,
19:41 last night.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.919
And according to Suzy,
the very nice desk clerk,

07:33.921 --> 07:36.755
Newton jogged every evening
since he arrived here.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.791
Duck?
Ducky:
I've always

07:38.792 --> 07:40.826
believed that jogging does
more harm than good.

07:40.828 --> 07:44.796
The major here is an extreme
example of my theory.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.465
The human body
was never designed

07:46.467 --> 07:47.966
to take that kind of pounding.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.035
It's calamitous
to the vertebrae,

07:50.037 --> 07:52.804
not to mention the trauma
it does to the knees.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.873
You got a tod, duck?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.975
Hmm? Oh, of course.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.110
Uh... 9:00 P.M.,

07:59.112 --> 08:02.614
give or take
half an hour. Yeah.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.250
His neck is distended,
probably broken.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.857
This gash
to his forehead is very deep,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.892
yet, there's very little
bleeding.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.927
I need to find out why.

08:15.929 --> 08:19.764
As always, I'll know more when
i get him back on the table.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.833
McGee and I will
finish up here.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.636
You and bishop check out
Newton's room at the voq.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.139
If I were going away for a week,

08:28.141 --> 08:30.542
I would have packed
twice as much.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.277
Oh, boy.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.845
Is that his wife?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.747
You tell me.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.750
Woof.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.752
You never knew Newton.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.821
There's not a woman
on this earth

08:42.823 --> 08:44.222
that would marry that dude.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.857
(Laughs)

08:45.859 --> 08:48.994
Well, he was certainly
sexually active.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.762
What makes you say that?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.197
Oh!

08:52.199 --> 08:53.932
Check the expiration date.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.700
What do you have
against this guy?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.903
Oh, I don't know.

08:57.905 --> 09:01.239
Just always kind of bugged me,
you know?

09:05.312 --> 09:07.579
Hey, this is weird.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.582
What?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.951
Why would he put
a used plastic knife...

09:12.953 --> 09:15.954
In a napkin, in an envelope?

09:18.158 --> 09:20.325
I haven't talked to major Newton

09:20.327 --> 09:22.160
since before he left here
last week.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.896
I was expecting him back
tomorrow.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.898
There anything unusual
going on in his life?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.900
Not that I know of.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.936
Do you have a reason to believe

09:30.938 --> 09:32.904
that Newton's death
wasn't an accident?
No.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.006
Called last night,
asked if we could talk.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.742
Any idea what
that was about?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.044
He didn't say anything to me.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.946
Colonel, we would occasionally
hear from major Newton

09:40.948 --> 09:44.616
about leads on the armory theft
that occurred two years ago.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.285
Was he still working
on that case?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.853
Not officially.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.889
After the conviction,
i thought it was over,

09:50.891 --> 09:53.258
but Newton wouldn't give up
on his accomplice theory.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.661
He was always looking
into it on his own time.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.196
Could you seal Newton's quarters
until you hear from us?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.931
I will.
Thank you.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.101
By the way, Gibbs...

10:03.103 --> 10:04.803
I like the new look.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.677
Find out who's stationed
at Quantico now,

10:12.679 --> 10:16.948
and who was at lejeune
when the armory was robbed.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.350
Hey.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.251
Abby: Hey, what's the speed
limit in a school zone?

10:20.253 --> 10:21.686
15 miles an hour.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.688
Bam! Thanks, Tony.
What are you doing?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.624
Um, on-line traffic school.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.092
What'd you get a ticket for?
Speeding?

10:27.094 --> 10:28.693
Run a red light?
No, no. I just...

10:28.695 --> 10:30.028
I needed to tell
sister Rosita

10:30.030 --> 10:31.863
that I was gonna
be late for bowling,

10:31.865 --> 10:33.331
so I pulled over
to the side of the road

10:33.333 --> 10:34.899
so I could safely text her,

10:34.901 --> 10:38.269
and I just kind of
tapped this other car.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.872
Just like a love tap,
you know.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.307
But it was a cop car.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.075
The cop was super cute.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.778
Not Burt cute,
but he gave me a ticket.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.081
But I have two days to finish
this test, so, what do you got?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.917
Uh, contents of major
Newton's voq room.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.153
Oh, hey, look.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.657
I just got the DNA results
from trackmydna.Com.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.858
Well, share.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.328
Oh... what does that mean?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.330
Share, Tony. Share.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.833
All right.
Goes on the plasma.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.136
Okay.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.676
Bishop: Huh.
So you're 89% European.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.145
Figures.
Your neanderthal quotient

11:20.147 --> 11:21.913
is 2.9%.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.984
That's in the 19th percentile,
Tony. That is high.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.786
Explains a lot.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.587
Abby: Ooh, look at that.
Tony: "Research indicates

11:29.588 --> 11:31.388
you have a familial match with
a historical British figure."

11:31.391 --> 11:34.759
Abby:
"For an additional $29.95,

11:34.761 --> 11:36.194
we will provide you
with the details."

11:36.196 --> 11:38.697
I will happily pay
for that. Click it.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.132
I want it. "Click here
to order." Click there.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.133
Click it!

11:43.036 --> 11:44.436
Click there.
Click there.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.274
(Phone ringing)

11:57.050 --> 11:58.049
Oh.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.050
Jake!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.051
Hey, it's McGee.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.053
How are you?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.056
No, she is, uh...
She's not in yet.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.125
Yes, I will definitely tell her.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.461
By the way, i-i have to say
that St. John's,

12:09.463 --> 12:10.995
this time of year...

12:10.997 --> 12:12.063
(Elevator bell chimes)
It's gonna be amazing.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.998
I am, I am so jealous.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.934
Gotta go, Jake.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.135
Morning, boss.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.471
I created a, uh, matrix

12:19.473 --> 12:22.407
of people who were stationed
at camp lejeune two years ago

12:22.409 --> 12:24.142
and are now at Quantico.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.746
Several names came up,
but one in particular stood out.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.082
Marine master sergeant
Ramsey Dillon.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.118
Now, last June,
Newton had us check him out.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.120
He thought
he was "the accomplice."

12:35.122 --> 12:36.154
Yeah, we didn't find anything.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.090
No, not at the time, but...

12:38.091 --> 12:40.025
Newton might have been
onto something.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.960
Because Dillon now works
in the armory at Quantico.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.962
(Phone ringing)

12:43.964 --> 12:46.064
Anybody else coming in today?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.265
It's still early, boss.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.134
Yeah, Abbs.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.935
Yeah, yeah. Be right down.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.272
McGee, when DiNozzo gets in,
you two go to Quantico.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.208
You talk
to master sergeant Dillon.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.194
This little baby is really cool.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.179
It's GPS-enabled, and it keeps
track of your distance jogged

13:01.181 --> 13:02.781
and your pace and time.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.250
And it also monitors your
heart rate and your steps taken.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.119
It's still hard to believe
that all that information

13:08.121 --> 13:11.222
is recorded on
that tiny device.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.291
Motion sensors also keep tabs
on how well you sleep.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.160
It interfaces
with the smartphone

13:15.162 --> 13:17.162
via Bluetooth,
and it can send you

13:17.164 --> 13:20.064
a weekly e-mail about your sleep
and exercise patterns.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.900
If you had told me,
30 years ago,

13:21.902 --> 13:24.269
of an e-mail,
sent from a bracelet,

13:24.271 --> 13:27.405
that rated your
activity in bed,

13:27.407 --> 13:29.307
my response to you
would have been...

13:30.243 --> 13:31.943
"What the blazes is an e-mail?"

13:31.945 --> 13:32.944
I'll second that.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.245
What's up, Abbs?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.147
You are gonna owe me
a jumbo caf-pow!

13:36.149 --> 13:37.282
I downloaded
the information

13:37.284 --> 13:39.217
from major Newton's
fitness bracelet.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.852
He left the voq

13:40.854 --> 13:44.289
at 20:23, and he jogged
for 1.1 miles.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.491
That's at marker number one.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.193
Then his bracelet
stopped monitoring

13:48.195 --> 13:50.562
his heartbeat
and his steps taken,

13:50.564 --> 13:53.231
but his body continued to move
for three-tenths of a mile

13:53.233 --> 13:54.432
down the trail.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.034
Major Newton's body

13:56.036 --> 13:58.236
was found here.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.904
He was moved.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.339
He was carried
to the second spot

14:01.341 --> 14:03.308
and rolled down into the ravine.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.810
Make it look
like an accident.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.311
Well, that would explain
the lack of bleeding.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.512
The gash
on his forehead

14:07.514 --> 14:10.181
was postmortem.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.149
He was killed.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.927
(Gunfire)

14:29.636 --> 14:33.872
Private wigg,
you are one sad gomer.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.106
Yes, sir!
In a combat situation,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.608
you'd be dead.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.343
You should be able
to do this

14:38.345 --> 14:41.346
blindfolded, at night,
in the rain.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.614
You understand?

14:42.616 --> 14:44.649
Yes, sir!
Strip it down

14:44.651 --> 14:45.984
and put it back together.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.152
And stop calling me "sir."

14:50.023 --> 14:52.657
Master sergeant
Dillon?

14:52.659 --> 14:53.625
Yeah?

14:53.627 --> 14:55.159
Can we talk to you
for a second?

14:55.161 --> 14:58.229
You guys are from NCIS.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.932
I talked to you
last year at lejeune.

15:00.934 --> 15:01.666
What now?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.268
Major Sussex Newton.
Told you

15:03.270 --> 15:05.103
I had nothing to do
with that robbery.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.437
What's he claiming now?

15:06.439 --> 15:08.439
Oh, he's not claiming anything.
He's dead.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.675
Killed last night,
here at Quantico.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.610
One of the trails
on heartbreak Ridge.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.612
The jogger? I-i...

15:14.614 --> 15:16.381
Thought that was an accident.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.248
Where were you last night?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.418
I was off base.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.022
Where?
Could we...

15:24.024 --> 15:26.257
Talk about this somewhere else?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.092
Sure.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.161
NCIS headquarters
work for you?

15:41.508 --> 15:43.708
I was in Richmond.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.611
Okay. What were
you doing there?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.548
I act in a local theatre group.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.984
We were rehearsing a play, okay?

15:52.986 --> 15:54.619
Really?
What-what's the play?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.020
Does it matter?

15:56.022 --> 15:57.488
Well... yeah.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.690
We're gonna
find out

15:58.692 --> 16:00.458
what play it was anyway.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.061
<i> La cage aux folles.</i>

16:04.464 --> 16:06.030
<i> La cage aux folles.</i>

16:07.500 --> 16:09.000
Please tell me
you're playing the part

16:09.002 --> 16:10.735
of the drag queen, zaza.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.272
(Bell chimes)

16:18.211 --> 16:20.678
Hey. You still taking
the traffic school test?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.280
Yeah.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.115
Oh, thanks.
Welcome.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.250
You earned it.
Well, I've got
something else.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.553
I'm not really sure what it is.
It could be nothing.
What?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.321
Well, there was a model number

16:30.323 --> 16:32.323
on that plastic knife
that Tony and bishop found

16:32.325 --> 16:34.125
in captain Newton's
voq room.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.994
It's the same brand
as knives used

16:35.996 --> 16:37.462
in Quantico base
restaurants.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.163
Probably a million
other places, too.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.498
Yeah, but I found
a fingerprint on it,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.066
and it's not Newton's.
You get a hit?

16:42.068 --> 16:43.134
I did.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.186
And it's not military.

16:45.187 --> 16:47.237
I matched it to a print from
a Virginia driver's license.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.773
It was just
issued last month.

16:49.642 --> 16:53.011
Lauren Hudson,
the civilian wife

16:53.013 --> 16:57.548
of captain Dean Hudson,
who's stationed at Quantico.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.084
McGee:
Dean Hudson.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.186
He was one of the people
in lejeune two years ago,

17:02.188 --> 17:03.521
and are now at Quantico.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.190
He transferred there
a little over a month ago.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.425
I'll pull up his service record.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.659
Tony: Could I have been
too hard on old newty?

17:08.661 --> 17:10.495
Maybe he was onto something.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.963
Why the wife?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.430
Why did he wrap the knife
in a napkin,

17:13.433 --> 17:14.549
to protect the print?

17:14.550 --> 17:15.666
And then he puts it
in an envelope.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.568
What was he doing,
bringing it to you, boss?

17:17.570 --> 17:20.104
Record's clean, and
he had no connection

17:20.106 --> 17:21.806
to the armory at either base.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.509
He's assigned to base
logistics at Quantico.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.178
What do we know about the wife?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.446
Bishop:
Not much.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.747
Civilian spouses are embedded.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.552
DiNozzo,

17:34.554 --> 17:36.554
we're going to Quantico,
talk to the Hudsons.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.823
You know, I was just at Quantico
with McGee earlier, and I...

17:38.825 --> 17:40.558
I'll get the sedan.
You two.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.627
Background Lauren Hudson.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.697
(Children shouting
playfully in distance)

17:49.302 --> 17:51.202
(Tony wolf whistles)

17:55.475 --> 17:58.209
This is my dream car.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.145
The interior, the color,
the wheels...

18:01.147 --> 18:02.580
That's a sexy machine.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.648
(Gibbs knocks on door)

18:04.584 --> 18:06.651
(Sighs)

18:08.288 --> 18:09.620
Can I help you?

18:09.622 --> 18:11.089
NCIS, Mrs. Hudson.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.825
Your husband home?
Yes.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.359
We'd like to talk
to both of you.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.661
About what?
Can we come in?

18:16.663 --> 18:18.563
Sure.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.697
Captain Hudson:
<i> Major Newton?</i>

18:19.699 --> 18:21.432
Yeah, I remember
him from lejeune.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.600
Mp officer.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.801
You met him, didn't you, hon?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.586
I don't think so.

18:25.587 --> 18:27.370
Have you seen him in
the last couple days, captain?

18:27.373 --> 18:29.140
Oh, no, we left lejeune
five weeks ago.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.875
He's been here
for Quantico the last week.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.643
Oh. No.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.779
No, I haven't bumped into him.
Why do you ask?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.447
He was found dead
yesterday morning

18:37.317 --> 18:38.516
on the heartbreak Ridge trail.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.251
Whoa.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.720
I had no idea
that was major Newton.
The jogger?

18:42.722 --> 18:45.523
Yeah.
We were talking about that
at the coffee shop this morning.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.858
Why are you asking us about him?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.159
Well, we're not sure
it was an accident.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.560
We're interviewing anybody

18:49.562 --> 18:50.761
who talked to him
here at Quantico.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.873
They know something.
Yep.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.242
I was waiting for you
to mention her fingerprints

19:04.244 --> 19:05.643
on the plastic knife.
Nah, nah.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.629
Don't know what it means yet.

19:07.630 --> 19:09.614
Let them worry about why
we're asking questions.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.682
I like your thinking.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.185
(Tires screech)

19:17.624 --> 19:18.656
(Elevator bell chimes)

19:18.658 --> 19:20.725
Bishop:
Okay, okay.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.529
What's up with our probie?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.697
I have no idea.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.267
How'd it go with captain Hudson
and the wife?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.169
Oh, well, they claim they didn't
know Newton was at Quantico.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.770
We kind of think they're lying.

19:32.772 --> 19:33.671
Oh, they're definitely lying.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.805
Bishop and I can prove it.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.208
How?
Well...

19:37.210 --> 19:38.609
Actually, I don't want
to have to explain it twice.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.777
Where's Gibbs?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.646
Oh, okay,
don't want to put you out.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.214
He's checking in with Abby.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.518
Oh, I got my response
from trackmydna.Com.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.188
Hey, did you answer my phone
this morning?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.856
Yeah.
Why?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.625
Well, I saw that it was Jake
on the caller I.D.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.960
I haven't talked to him
in a while.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.361
I thought you wouldn't mind.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.198
Hm. And you mentioned my trip
to St. John?

20:00.200 --> 20:00.865
Yeah.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.736
It was an anniversary present.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.839
A surprise.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.241
Oh.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.475
Sorry.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.477
(Chuckles) Look at that.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.880
I'm a direct descendent
of Archibald drummond,

20:15.882 --> 20:17.815
17th Earl of Trent.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.717
I've never been able
to surprise Jake.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.421
Thanks for ruining
my anniversary.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.522
Bishop, I'm sorry.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.390
Oh!

20:26.392 --> 20:27.959
He's handsome.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.894
Look at that Randy dandy.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.496
By god, there is
a familial resemblance.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.832
On your own time, DiNozzo.
McGee: Boss, we have proof

20:34.834 --> 20:36.768
the Hudsons were lying.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.703
They definitely knew
that Newton was at Quantico.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.238
Bishop: Uh, Newton had lunch
at a base restaurant

20:40.240 --> 20:41.339
the day he was murdered.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.241
His credit card
was swiped at 12:32.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.809
This is the security footage.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.711
You can see
captain Hudson there,

20:46.713 --> 20:47.712
and his wife.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.013
And there's Newton.

20:49.015 --> 20:49.947
Newton.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.320
She looks uncomfortable.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.388
Hmm.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.424
What's going on there?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.026
Bishop: Yeah, they're sure
in a hurry to get out of there.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.394
Barely finished
their lunch.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.761
Why did they lie
about seeing Newton?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.797
Maybe we should go
pick them up?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.433
Gibbs:
No, no.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.868
Not yet. Hang on.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.274
Newton knew something.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.975
He took her knife
for a reason. Why?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.477
We need hard evidence.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.778
People across the
street from Hudson,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.546
they were moving, right?
Yeah.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.515
Okay, we put them
under surveillance.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.783
Well, boss, it's gonna be hard

21:25.785 --> 21:27.885
to hide in the house
and not be seen.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.303
Not gonna have to hide, McGee.

21:29.304 --> 21:30.720
You and bishop will
go in undercover...

21:32.892 --> 21:34.392
...as a married couple.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.060
Uh, why us?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.528
Tony:
Well, it's got to be you two.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.364
The Hudsons already know
the boss and I are NCIS.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.913
Hey, crispian, uh, it is your
cousin Tony calling.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.916
Uh, your American cousin
Anthony DiNozzo, junior.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.618
It's been a while.

22:00.620 --> 22:04.088
And, uh, listen, I'm calling you
because I found out that we are,

22:04.090 --> 22:07.658
in fact, related
to the 17th Earl of Trent--

22:07.660 --> 22:09.660
one Archibald drummond.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.595
So if you know anything
about this, give me a call.

22:11.597 --> 22:14.065
Uh, otherwise, uh,
talk to you soon. Bye.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.567
Hope you choke
on your inheritance.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.735
Talking to yourself, DiNozzo?

22:17.737 --> 22:19.036
Sort of.
What'd you find out

22:19.038 --> 22:20.671
about Lauren Hudson?
Well, I found out

22:20.673 --> 22:22.873
she was the former
Lauren merriweather

22:22.875 --> 22:25.810
of Bradley manor--
longwood, Bethesda.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.511
Been married to captain
Hudson for five years.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.713
Her father died
three years ago,

22:28.715 --> 22:30.365
left her mega millions.

22:30.366 --> 22:32.016
That explains the corvette.
Yes, and...

22:32.018 --> 22:33.718
This is where little
Lauren grew up.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.655
House doesn't have an address,
it has a name: Owlwood.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.857
I put in a call
to the family lawyer.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.026
Tony, you there?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.929
Oh, the newlywed
got the videolink set up.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.697
Hey, little buddy, you miss us?

22:46.699 --> 22:49.100
It's only been a day.
Well, I miss you.
Where's your wife?

22:49.102 --> 22:51.802
She is at the office,
so I haven't heard a word.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.637
You make contact
with Mrs. Hudson yet?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.639
Uh, not yet.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.640
But right now, she's in
her front yard, gardening.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.143
Think I'm gonna
go introduce myself.

22:59.145 --> 23:02.380
Behave.
Big brother's watching.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.521
Hi.
How are you ?

23:10.523 --> 23:12.523
Good, how are you?
Good. I'm, uh,

23:12.525 --> 23:14.825
I'm Tim donen. I just actually
moved across the street.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.594
Oh, yeah, I know,
i saw the moving Van.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.795
Lauren Hudson.
Hi.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.163
Are you a marine, Tim?
Oh, no, no, no.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.798
Not me. I am definitely
not a marine.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.932
My wife Ellie is.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.834
I'm actually a
computer programmer.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.570
I get to telecommute
from home, which is very nice.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.772
What about you?

23:27.774 --> 23:29.774
Oh, I'm just
doing some gardening,

23:29.776 --> 23:32.176
hanging around the house...
Reading a lot.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.413
My husband's hitch is up in
two months. He's processing out.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.581
Well, hey, listen, I was
wondering-- I don't know

23:37.583 --> 23:39.083
who the local Internet service
provider is around here.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.718
Do you think maybe you could

23:40.720 --> 23:42.119
point me in the
right direction?
Got the number inside.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.521
Come on, I'll get it.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.689
Thank you.
Where's your, uh, wife work?

23:45.691 --> 23:47.124
At the base
logistics office.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.327
Oh, no way.
Yeah.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.529
What a coincidence. That's
where my husband Dean works.
Hm.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.600
Good work, Timmy.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.769
(Indistinct conversations)

23:59.639 --> 24:01.505
Dean: Hey, neighbor.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.573
Dean Hudson.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.041
Just got a call
from my wife.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.577
Said you and your husband
moved in across the street.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.746
Hi. Ellie donen, sir.
Where were you before this?

24:08.748 --> 24:11.715
Uh, robertson barracks.
Darwin, Australia.
Wow. Welcome home.

24:11.717 --> 24:15.519
Thanks.
I see you got the standard
assigned reading.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.755
Uh, read this, this...

24:17.757 --> 24:19.957
And if you're ever having a hard
time falling asleep at night--

24:19.959 --> 24:21.459
read this.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.660
(Laughs)
Thanks.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.595
Forget the rest, trust me.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.464
Thanks.
Hey, once you're
settled in,

24:26.466 --> 24:28.632
I'm right down the hall.
I'll give you the tour.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.900
That would be great, sir.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.169
All right.
Uh, I'd love to meet your wife.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.839
Maybe we could all
get together some time.
Oh, sure.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.240
Yeah, I barbecue
a mean hamburger.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.242
Our place?
Dinner Saturday?

24:38.244 --> 24:39.710
Sounds good.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.679
All right.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.855
Appreciate you coming in,
Mr. worthington.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.623
No problem.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.525
Business brings me to DC

24:54.527 --> 24:57.795
a couple of days a week.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.965
I assume if naval
criminal investigators

25:00.967 --> 25:02.733
are asking
about Lauren,

25:02.735 --> 25:04.935
it must have something to
do with her marine husband.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.270
You ever meet him?
Twice.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.772
Their wedding
and her father's funeral.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.107
How well do you know Lauren?

25:10.109 --> 25:11.809
Is she in some kind of trouble?

25:11.811 --> 25:14.545
Well, I hope not, but we think
her husband may have

25:14.547 --> 25:16.814
valuable information
in a homicide investigation.

25:16.816 --> 25:17.915
Aren't they cooperating?

25:21.721 --> 25:24.955
I was the family attorney
since before she was born.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.224
Sweet girl.

25:27.226 --> 25:30.027
Always found her
to be trustworthy

25:30.029 --> 25:31.795
and forthright.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.731
What was Lauren's relationship
with her father?

25:33.733 --> 25:34.865
They adored one another.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.767
Her mother died when
she was a-a child.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.252
He raised her.

25:38.253 --> 25:39.736
I think the only thing
that she ever did

25:39.739 --> 25:42.606
that he disapproved of was
when she married Dean.

25:42.608 --> 25:44.008
Why's that?

25:44.010 --> 25:46.877
My guess? He thought
he was after the money.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.878
What do you think?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.915
No comment.

25:50.917 --> 25:51.882
Lauren have
any siblings?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.117
None.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.152
Other than a few
charitable donations,

25:55.154 --> 25:57.721
the father left the
entire estate to her.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.157
But didn't change
Lauren's lifestyle.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.892
She was never about the money.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.827
You talk with her recently?
Couple of years ago.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.663
We worked together closely,

26:05.665 --> 26:07.898
liquidating the assets from
the estate, transferring them

26:07.900 --> 26:10.301
into her name... took
about a year and a half.

26:10.303 --> 26:13.871
Once we were done, there was
no need for us to communicate.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.941
I do get Christmas cards.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.814
Anthony.

26:23.816 --> 26:24.815
Oh, I was just leaving.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.617
Uh, do you need
something?

26:26.619 --> 26:28.319
Have you released
major Newton's body yet?

26:28.321 --> 26:30.321
No, no, no, he's still here.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.156
Oh, is something wrong?

26:32.158 --> 26:35.726
Well, this would sound funny
to anyone else, ducky, but...

26:35.728 --> 26:38.596
I know you'll understand.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.598
I need to have a word with him.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.899
Of course.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.068
Thanks.
May I ask the, uh,

26:44.070 --> 26:45.836
nature of this discussion?

26:45.838 --> 26:49.006
Well, I owe him an apology.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.608
Ah.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.910
I always dismissed Newton
as a waste of our time.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.980
But he was
onto something, and...

26:55.982 --> 26:57.915
I just thought I would tell him

26:57.917 --> 26:59.917
he would've made a great agent.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.720
Well, I'm sure
he would appreciate that.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.990
Yeah. And be sure to turn
these off when you leave.

27:05.992 --> 27:08.659
He's in, uh, 206.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.027
One other question.
I know you're, uh,

27:10.029 --> 27:11.795
an expert
in English history.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.864
And I was just wondering...

27:13.866 --> 27:16.100
Have you ever heard of
Archibald drummond,

27:16.102 --> 27:17.968
the 17th Earl of Trent?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.871
The Earl of Trent.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.974
No, I can't say I have. Why?

27:23.976 --> 27:24.875
Hm.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.310
It's no...

27:26.312 --> 27:29.146
Just... wondering.
Thanks.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.268
Anything?

27:51.270 --> 27:52.670
No.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.271
She just brought
a moving box down

27:54.273 --> 27:56.006
from the spare bedroom.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.075
He's on his way back
from the store.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.010
The, uh, tracking device
you planted

28:00.012 --> 28:01.745
shows that he's
two blocks away.

28:01.747 --> 28:02.913
Well, I did the dishes.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.148
Mine and yours.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.816
Thanks.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.019
Are we okay?

28:10.389 --> 28:12.256
You think that
doing my dinner dishes makes up

28:12.258 --> 28:15.025
for ruining the surprise weekend
i had planned for Jake?
Look, bishop,

28:15.027 --> 28:17.961
I'm sorry, okay? If it was
supposed to be a surprise,

28:17.963 --> 28:19.329
why didn't you say anything?

28:25.838 --> 28:27.838
This is not going away, is it?

28:35.981 --> 28:39.116
This isn't just about
ruining the surprise.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.886
You want to talk?

28:49.762 --> 28:53.464
Things with Jake are just...

28:53.466 --> 28:55.866
Not the same.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.401
(Phone rings)

29:00.106 --> 29:02.973
It's him.
Better take it.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.977
Hey, Jake.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.815
(Car approaching)

29:24.964 --> 29:28.165
Dean:
Hey.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.467
Stopped by the hardware store
on the way home,

29:30.469 --> 29:34.438
got the extension cord
for the living room lamp.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.973
Dinner's not ready?

29:35.975 --> 29:38.242
Lauren: No. I got distracted
in the spare room.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.844
We have to deal
with these boxes. All of them.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.046
Dean:
Relax, babe. There's no rush.

29:43.516 --> 29:46.183
(Lauren sighs deeply)

29:46.185 --> 29:48.185
There is.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.487
I mean, I've gone along with
everything that you've asked me

29:50.489 --> 29:53.090
to do-- some of it
a little too freakish.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.159
Please do this for me.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.098
Here's your money back.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.866
What is that for?

30:02.868 --> 30:05.102
It's for my caf-pow!--
I don't deserve it.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.037
Remember when I matched
the fingerprint

30:07.039 --> 30:09.106
from the knife
to Lauren Hudson's

30:09.108 --> 30:10.340
Virginia driver's license?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.975
Well, I just
stopped right there.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.410
Like, I didn't dig keep going.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.578
Why would you?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.079
Let me tell you
why I should have.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.248
Last night, I was
working on the final section

30:18.250 --> 30:20.384
of my traffic
school test.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.452
Did you know that when
you move to the district

30:22.454 --> 30:25.189
from another state, you have
30 days to relinquish

30:25.191 --> 30:27.391
your old driver's license
and then get a DC one?

30:27.393 --> 30:31.295
Except if you're a student,
a presidential appointee,

30:31.297 --> 30:34.965
a member of congress
or a military family.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.466
And it goes the same
for Virginia,

30:36.468 --> 30:37.968
only it's 60 days.
Abb,

30:37.970 --> 30:39.336
do you got any idea
where this is going?

30:39.338 --> 30:42.139
Well, nobody
wants to go to the dmv

30:42.141 --> 30:44.208
unless they have to.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.976
Right? So why

30:45.978 --> 30:48.312
did Lauren Hudson rush out

30:48.314 --> 30:50.948
and get a new license
when she didn't have to?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.950
I mean, she didn't even
get a new license

30:52.952 --> 30:54.484
when she moved
to north Carolina.

30:54.486 --> 30:58.222
And that got me thinking.
So I pulled her Maryland

30:58.224 --> 31:01.225
driver's license that
she surrendered, and this

31:01.227 --> 31:02.626
is her new Virginia
driver's license.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.263
Same woman, right?

31:06.265 --> 31:07.998
Yeah.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.117
That's what I thought.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.235
And probably what
the dmv clerk thought, also.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.205
Same hairstyle, same hair
color, the exact same glasses.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.608
But look what happens
when we superimpose the photos

31:17.610 --> 31:21.111
on top of each other--
everything's a little off.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.247
The jawline,
the shape of the nose...

31:23.249 --> 31:26.283
Check out the beauty mark.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.654
It moved
15 millimeters, Gibbs.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.656
Beauty marks
don't move.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.458
The beauty mark from the
Maryland driver's license

31:34.460 --> 31:37.027
is raised.
The one from the Virginia

31:37.029 --> 31:39.263
driver's license is penciled on.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.064
That's not the same woman.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.532
It was close... but no cigar.

31:42.534 --> 31:46.003
And the fingerprints don't
match-- I checked that, too.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.505
So the Lauren Hudson we've been
watching is not the real wife.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.941
Well, who is she?

31:52.044 --> 31:53.377
And where's the real wife?

32:02.488 --> 32:04.488
She's not Lauren Hudson?
Who is she?

32:04.490 --> 32:08.225
Abby: We don't know yet.
My bet is the real
Lauren Hudson is dead,

32:08.227 --> 32:10.961
and her husband and the mystery
woman killed her for the money.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.262
When? Where?

32:12.264 --> 32:14.197
Probably just before
they left lejeune.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.599
Dean Hudson arrives
at Quantico

32:15.601 --> 32:17.267
with a woman that
looks like his wife,

32:17.269 --> 32:19.202
she assumes her identity.
I think

32:19.204 --> 32:20.526
they're planning on
leaving the country

32:20.527 --> 32:21.849
as soon as the
captain's hitch is up.

32:21.850 --> 32:23.172
What makes you think that?
Because our imposter

32:23.175 --> 32:25.409
has also applied
for a passport

32:25.411 --> 32:27.244
as Lauren Hudson.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.946
Would've gotten away with it

32:28.948 --> 32:30.748
if it weren't
for good old newty.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.549
This has nothing to do with
the robbery at camp lejeune.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.984
Where's McGee?
Bishop: Well, the wife,

32:33.986 --> 32:35.953
whoever she is,
left the house five minutes ago.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.254
He's tailing her.

32:37.256 --> 32:38.722
We got enough
to bring them in now.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.257
We're on our way.
Alert McGee.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.225
Get 'em!

32:49.435 --> 32:51.134
Hi! You're back.
Hi.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.144
Man: New latte!

33:01.146 --> 33:02.245
Hey, neighbor!

33:02.247 --> 33:03.864
Hey.

33:03.865 --> 33:05.482
You've discovered the
best coffee in Quantico.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.317
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.618
Well, I hate drinking alone.
I'm buying.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.987
(Phone ringing)
What's your pleasure?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.254
Um...

33:14.059 --> 33:16.326
Uh, small black coffee
would be great.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.694
You got it.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.230
McGee's not picking up.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.667
Hudson's leaving.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.469
The house is empty.
I'm going in.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.070
Bishop, no.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.338
Don't go in there.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.573
I'm gonna take a look around,

33:29.575 --> 33:32.109
maybe get a lead
on who this woman really is.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.377
Ju-just wait.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.112
Gibbs and Tony are
on their way over there.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.614
Look, Gibbs is always telling me
to take the initiative.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.316
Watch the house.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.384
Bishop!

34:07.479 --> 34:09.546
¶ ¶

34:37.242 --> 34:39.309
¶ ¶

35:00.132 --> 35:01.531
Tony:
<i> Got some accrued annual...</i>

35:01.533 --> 35:02.532
Leave.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.434
Thinking about visiting

35:04.436 --> 35:07.304
my ancestral home, england.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.407
Why this sudden interest,
DiNozzo?

35:12.311 --> 35:15.479
Been thinking
about family a lot.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.448
I mean,
all I have is senior, really.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.150
And he's not getting
any younger.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.219
I don't have anyone else.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.222
The way things are going,

35:25.224 --> 35:27.757
I don't see kids
in my future, so...

35:27.759 --> 35:29.493
I don't know.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.795
Guess I'm searching
for a sense of belonging.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.590
¶ ¶

36:10.502 --> 36:12.869
"Rita applegate."

36:14.239 --> 36:16.206
Gotcha.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.874
Well, I should, uh, I should
probably get back to work.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.342
Oh, so I see you got
your problem

36:19.344 --> 36:20.477
with your Internet fixed?

36:20.479 --> 36:21.945
Yeah, I did.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.747
So if you ever want to try
one of their treats,

36:23.749 --> 36:25.615
you have to try
their chocolate croissants. Mmm!

36:25.617 --> 36:27.417
Special agent McGee!

36:27.419 --> 36:30.187
Has NCIS determined whether
major Newton's death

36:30.189 --> 36:31.588
was accidental or not?

36:31.590 --> 36:33.423
There's a rumor going around
that he was murdered.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.732
The jerk who moved in across
the street is an NCIS agent.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.539
Hands on the wheel.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.757
(Sighs)

37:11.230 --> 37:12.729
Oh, no. Oh, no.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.435
(Line ringing)
Bishop, pick up, pick up.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.338
Come on, pick up,
bishop, come on.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.606
Come on, bishop-- pick up!

37:22.608 --> 37:24.874
(Phone ringing)

37:25.978 --> 37:27.544
Come on, come on...

37:27.546 --> 37:29.512
Oh, no.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.584
(Phone rings)

37:36.255 --> 37:37.254
Gibbs, thank god!

37:37.256 --> 37:38.521
I-i got you.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.201
You've got to hurry, okay?

37:40.202 --> 37:41.880
Bishop hasn't been
picking up her phone!

37:41.881 --> 37:43.559
I told her not...
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down. Abby.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.562
But bishop went
into the house by herself.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.896
And then Hudson just pulled up,

37:46.898 --> 37:48.465
and he just went in, too.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.634
(Engine revs)

38:10.022 --> 38:11.988
(Grunting)

38:19.998 --> 38:21.564
(Gasps)
Oh, my god!

38:21.566 --> 38:22.632
Bishop!

38:24.603 --> 38:27.037
(Grunting continues)

38:57.669 --> 38:58.735
(Groaning)

39:03.608 --> 39:05.642
Bishop!

39:05.644 --> 39:07.944
Bishop:
Upstairs!

39:13.051 --> 39:14.117
Tony:
You all right?

39:14.119 --> 39:15.719
Hudson needs an ambulance.

39:15.721 --> 39:16.920
I found the wife.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.657
Don't move.

39:26.098 --> 39:28.631
Ducky: Her body was preserved
in formaldehyde,

39:28.633 --> 39:30.667
glutaraldehyde, phenol--

39:30.669 --> 39:32.502
basically, embalming fluids.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.537
Stuffed into a vacuum-sealed
storage bag.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.705
That's why there was no odor.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.006
And very little decay.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.074
And a cause of death, duck?

39:38.076 --> 39:39.509
Yeah, a fractured neck.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.944
Sharp left-to-right twist.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.512
Same as major Newton.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.646
Who do I notify

39:43.648 --> 39:45.815
about her remains?
She had no family

39:45.817 --> 39:47.450
except the husband
that killed her.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.519
I'll call her father's lawyer.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.421
Do we know
who the imposter really is?

39:51.423 --> 39:53.557
Rita applegate.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.692
She was a waitress at a bar
not far from lejeune.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.044
That's where they met.

39:57.045 --> 39:58.395
Discovered they had
a lot in common.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.563
She and captain Hudson
shared similar, um,

40:00.565 --> 40:03.600
<i> desires</i> that his wife didn't.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.502
She wants to cut a deal
and is willing to testify.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.570
Says that Hudson killed his wife

40:07.572 --> 40:09.305
and transferred the body,

40:09.306 --> 40:11.039
all along with
their personal possessions.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.610
After Hudson retired, they were
gonna dispose of the body,

40:13.612 --> 40:15.979
move to the Caribbean
and live off of Lauren's money.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.748
Greed-- the root of much evil.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.650
Morning, my lord.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.718
Hey, ducky.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.587
Those are awfully
nice-looking flowers.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.556
I take it that you
and Jake made up.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.860
Those aren't from Jake.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.763
They're from McGee.

40:33.765 --> 40:34.697
Tony:
Aw.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.132
Well, that's kind of sweet.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.501
So, you-you guys are good again?

40:38.503 --> 40:39.602
Bishop:
Yeah.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.871
Actually, McGee saved me.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.774
I canceled my trip,
got my deposit back,

40:44.776 --> 40:47.644
and, uh, it was a good thing.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.646
Jake has to go out of town
that weekend.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.748
A summit somewhere in Asia.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.583
Somewhere? Asia's big.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.118
Yep. Need-to-know.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.653
Couldn't tell me where.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.054
We'll take
our little trip another time.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.756
Yeah.

40:59.758 --> 41:00.957
So I got this, uh,

41:00.959 --> 41:03.827
leave request of yours.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.629
You still going to england?

41:10.836 --> 41:13.670
No, I think I'll take that trip
another time.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.805
Uh, thank you.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.241
Um, you know,
that heritage stuff

41:18.243 --> 41:19.943
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.546
What happened?

41:26.151 --> 41:28.151
Well...

41:30.121 --> 41:33.823
My cousin, crispian,
called back.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.859
He knows all about

41:35.861 --> 41:36.993
Archibald drummond.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.761
(Chuckles) It turns out

41:38.763 --> 41:41.531
Archie...
Was quite a character.

41:41.533 --> 41:43.099
He was a...

41:43.101 --> 41:46.569
He was a scoundrel,
and a-a thief, a con man.

41:46.571 --> 41:47.904
Died in newgate prison.

41:47.906 --> 41:51.808
Crispian says that some
historians suspect that, uh,

41:51.810 --> 41:54.043
he may have been...

41:54.045 --> 41:55.812
Jack the ripper.
