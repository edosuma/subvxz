WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:02.333
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:02.358 --> 00:04.019
She's still not willing
to come to a meeting.

00:04.043 --> 00:06.643
This may be a situation
where you need to step up,

00:06.678 --> 00:08.045
<i>lead, be the man.</i>

00:09.838 --> 00:11.909
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No interruption.

00:11.963 --> 00:12.827
Jabari Johnson.

00:12.863 --> 00:14.095
Who told you I did this?

00:14.131 --> 00:15.618
Mr. McCready's father, Henry.

00:15.657 --> 00:18.068
- What did Henry say, exactly?
- That you paid him to burn down.

00:18.092 --> 00:21.895
First Baptist Church in 1983,
the one Darryl James died in.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.240
I don't know what kind of deal you cut

00:23.264 --> 00:25.131
to get out of jail with this story,

00:25.629 --> 00:26.524
you're going back.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.781
I'm not going anywhere.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.384
Everybody at school knows.

00:29.419 --> 00:30.739
Is that why you took those pills?

00:30.764 --> 00:32.798
Yeah. Why isn't he in jail?

00:37.188 --> 00:41.808
Right here is the new pastor
of Triumph Two,

00:42.484 --> 00:44.117
Jacob Greenleaf.

00:44.152 --> 00:46.684
- What do you have against me?
- You killed my daddy.

00:46.730 --> 00:48.163
You're Darryl James's boy?

00:48.199 --> 00:49.698
<i>We got a little trouble</i>

00:49.733 --> 00:50.881
over at Triumph Two with the excavation.

00:50.902 --> 00:53.589
The water table's higher than
the Geological Survey indicated.

00:53.625 --> 00:55.949
My life's not about you, Pop.
It's about me.

00:55.985 --> 00:58.204
- He doesn't respect me.
- I respect you.

01:09.404 --> 01:10.404
Ma'am?

01:12.411 --> 01:13.815
Is this the one you meant?

01:13.834 --> 01:16.668
Yes, that's the one. Thank you, Maricel.

01:32.109 --> 01:33.637
I'm on my way to the airport.

01:33.650 --> 01:34.790
Traffic's going to be terrible.

01:34.814 --> 01:37.080
I know, but Lionel's a friend.

01:37.116 --> 01:39.116
And after all that sweet music,

01:39.151 --> 01:41.485
I'm gonna have a little
impromptu concert in the car.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.994
You got more flowers here
than last year.

01:46.013 --> 01:48.247
They're a gift from Donny Wilcox.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.647
Well, I wasn't concerned.

01:50.683 --> 01:52.183
But praise God.

01:56.622 --> 01:58.856
- Hey.
- Hi, Grandpa.

02:00.226 --> 02:03.594
Now, are you ready
for your first revival?

02:03.629 --> 02:05.796
- As soon as I get changed.
- Hallelujah!

02:08.000 --> 02:09.374
Who am I going to talk to all night?

02:09.382 --> 02:11.315
I don't know what to tell you.

02:11.350 --> 02:13.217
We're a Triumph family now.

02:15.388 --> 02:16.544
It's been so long. I feel like...

02:16.568 --> 02:18.279
- Hey!
- Hi.

02:18.315 --> 02:20.892
Hi. I'll call you
right back after, okay?

02:20.927 --> 02:22.325
Sophia, you remember Pastor Rebecca?

02:22.349 --> 02:23.452
Yeah, of course.

02:23.487 --> 02:25.280
Welcome to Memphis.

02:25.321 --> 02:26.533
Thank you.

02:26.573 --> 02:28.283
You guys are pre-gaming, I see.

02:28.318 --> 02:30.151
Yes. Getting in the spirit.

02:30.187 --> 02:32.387
- It's my fault.
- I'm not judging.

02:32.422 --> 02:33.956
Can I have a little?

02:33.991 --> 02:36.525
- No, ma'am, you may not.
- Now I'm judging.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.893
Go get ready, babe.

02:39.662 --> 02:42.129
I'm judging.

02:42.164 --> 02:45.633
My gosh, I can't believe
we were ever that young.

02:45.668 --> 02:46.801
Girl, we were younger.

02:46.836 --> 02:48.514
Unbelievable.

02:48.549 --> 02:51.171
I know. How about that?

02:51.207 --> 02:53.830
No, I haven't seen it yet.

02:53.850 --> 02:56.017
I know. I want to.

02:56.053 --> 02:58.553
But you don't know
what it's like with a baby.

02:58.588 --> 03:01.189
- I can't just...
- Hey, here he is.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.590
All ready to go.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.193
I got to go. I'll see you tomorrow.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.609
- Jabari?
- Yeah.

03:09.644 --> 03:13.044
He wants me to watch some movie
about backup singers.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.313
I think he's trying to up
my choreography game

03:15.349 --> 03:16.882
in the absence of Carlton.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.789
People without children
don't understand.

03:19.816 --> 03:22.316
- That's for sure.
- Hi.

03:22.352 --> 03:23.818
Hi.

03:28.766 --> 03:30.231
Can I ask?

03:30.267 --> 03:31.488
What?

03:32.836 --> 03:35.404
When do you think
you might be ready to...?

03:35.439 --> 03:36.505
Ready for what?

03:37.740 --> 03:38.740
Be with me again.

03:40.278 --> 03:42.611
Is it... is it wrong that I ask that?

03:45.149 --> 03:46.614
You want to have sex with me?

03:46.650 --> 03:48.483
Yeah. Is that so strange?

03:50.033 --> 03:52.834
A little, given...

03:52.869 --> 03:55.303
Baby, I love you.

03:56.426 --> 03:57.526
And I really miss you.

04:00.726 --> 04:03.991
So let's do it tonight.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.628
- It's a date.
- Yeah.

05:04.219 --> 05:05.919
Been a while since you've seen Memphis.

05:05.954 --> 05:07.754
Looks different.

05:07.789 --> 05:09.722
Things were bad for a stretch,

05:09.758 --> 05:11.524
but they're starting to turn around.

05:14.962 --> 05:17.430
Shame Patrice couldn't be with us.

05:17.465 --> 05:19.098
Indeed it is.

05:19.133 --> 05:20.533
You know, I went to pack,

05:20.568 --> 05:22.001
I couldn't even find the suitcase,

05:22.036 --> 05:24.002
let alone my kit and everything.

05:24.037 --> 05:26.461
And when I did find it,
well, it was full of shells

05:26.497 --> 05:28.299
she had gathered
on our last trip to Captiva.

05:29.641 --> 05:30.851
I sat on the bed for about an hour,

05:30.875 --> 05:33.199
just going through shells,

05:33.778 --> 05:35.778
staring into space.

05:35.813 --> 05:39.248
We always enjoyed our time
down there with the two of you.

05:39.283 --> 05:40.314
Mae especially.

05:41.727 --> 05:43.059
How's Mae holding up?

05:43.094 --> 05:45.796
This business with Mac
had to be hard for her.

05:45.831 --> 05:47.431
Yes, it was.

05:48.772 --> 05:50.261
A sharp pain.

05:51.242 --> 05:52.841
But it gets a little duller every day.

05:54.171 --> 05:56.137
And I'm hoping this... this revival

05:56.162 --> 05:59.163
will be the beginning of a new chapter.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.503
Is that Jacob?

06:03.538 --> 06:05.438
- Where?
- Up there. Right there.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.278
Yes. That's my son.

06:20.593 --> 06:22.893
Maricel? Maricel?

06:22.928 --> 06:24.628
Yes, sir?

06:24.663 --> 06:26.174
Would you please have
Pastor Geoffrey's bags

06:26.198 --> 06:27.831
brought in from the car, please?

06:27.866 --> 06:29.746
- Right away, sir.
- And where's the first lady?

06:32.217 --> 06:34.318
Look, let's... let's go around this way.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.885
I'm sure she'll be glad to see you.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.754
We'll surprise her.

06:37.789 --> 06:40.057
Paul? Paul!

06:48.733 --> 06:50.299
Excuse me.

06:51.319 --> 06:53.919
There he is. Come on, come on.

06:57.425 --> 06:59.176
That's right!

06:59.894 --> 07:04.562
I remember you girls thinking
it was the most adorable thing.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.198
Wait, who sang what? When?

07:06.233 --> 07:07.632
Nobody. Nobody.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.813
Your mom and I,
and Charity and Faith

07:09.840 --> 07:11.673
had a little group called "Mystique."

07:11.709 --> 07:14.042
We sang at the churches in the area.

07:14.077 --> 07:16.912
Mystique. Very interesting.

07:16.947 --> 07:19.013
They were really quite good.

07:19.048 --> 07:20.715
I would kill to see that.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.614
I have a tape I can send you.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.428
Thanks.

07:24.463 --> 07:25.996
Don't hate. We were good.

07:26.032 --> 07:27.764
We were fine.

07:27.799 --> 07:29.566
She's wrong. We were good.

07:29.601 --> 07:31.068
Baby, go get me...

07:37.122 --> 07:38.454
Let me get this straight.

07:38.489 --> 07:40.256
You mean to tell me your brother Jacob

07:40.291 --> 07:42.726
is setting up shop right across
the street from the bishop's?

07:42.761 --> 07:44.126
He's getting ready to.

07:44.146 --> 07:45.679
They start digging the hole next week.

07:45.714 --> 07:46.912
You sure he isn't adopted?

07:48.368 --> 07:49.800
Y'all need to check his bloodline.

07:49.835 --> 07:51.568
I'd do anything for the bishop.

07:53.338 --> 07:54.904
Watch out there, now.

07:54.939 --> 07:56.273
Hey, how are you?

07:56.308 --> 07:57.974
Hey, Daddy.

07:59.162 --> 08:01.162
Look who I found.

08:01.197 --> 08:03.898
Lionel, you made it.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.166
Mae.

08:05.201 --> 08:06.433
Yes.

08:06.469 --> 08:08.799
Thank you so much for joining us.

08:08.839 --> 08:10.739
Well, when the Greenleafs call...

08:10.774 --> 08:12.574
Yes. So, how was your flight?

08:12.610 --> 08:15.143
Well, like riding
a wheelchair down a staircase

08:15.178 --> 08:17.078
for two straight hours.

08:17.114 --> 08:18.887
You know, Rebecca
says the same thing.

08:18.922 --> 08:21.601
What a shame y'all had that weather.

08:21.636 --> 08:23.511
Well, I'm fine. I'm on solid ground now.

08:23.518 --> 08:25.529
- Would you like some champagne?
- That would be great.

08:25.553 --> 08:27.264
- Thank you, James.
- I'll be right back, honey.

08:27.288 --> 08:28.387
Okay.

08:30.090 --> 08:33.405
- Mae...
- Don't say anything, please.

08:33.493 --> 08:35.270
I just want you to know
that I didn't come here

08:35.294 --> 08:36.693
to cause you any trouble.

08:36.730 --> 08:39.596
But you're here
when you knew my preference

08:39.631 --> 08:41.264
was that you'd not be.

08:41.299 --> 08:44.034
James called. I had no choice.

08:44.068 --> 08:46.369
Here you go.

08:46.405 --> 08:48.405
Thank you.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.707
Well, cheers.

08:50.743 --> 08:51.932
Ch-cheers.

08:51.957 --> 08:53.610
Yes.

08:55.086 --> 08:58.254
So, what do you say
we go find Errol?

08:58.289 --> 08:59.755
I haven't seen that old coot

08:59.790 --> 09:01.890
since we had the Faith
and Worship last year.

09:01.926 --> 09:03.570
I just passed him. Come on.

09:03.595 --> 09:04.661
Mae.

09:04.686 --> 09:05.752
Goodbye, Mae.

09:18.244 --> 09:20.978
Hey. That went off without a hitch.

09:21.013 --> 09:22.846
- Yes.
- I must say, I...

09:22.881 --> 09:24.088
I picked the right woman.

09:25.337 --> 09:27.070
And I picked the right man.

09:28.952 --> 09:30.852
But, sweetheart, I think you need to go

09:30.887 --> 09:32.520
and see Dr. Elliott tomorrow.

09:32.555 --> 09:34.154
I saw him last week, dear.

09:34.190 --> 09:36.390
I got the new prescription. I just...

09:36.425 --> 09:38.158
I just didn't take it today.

09:38.194 --> 09:39.727
Because...?

09:42.465 --> 09:44.497
It makes me sick,

09:44.532 --> 09:46.466
and I knew I needed to be at my best.

09:46.848 --> 09:49.032
Sweetheart,

09:49.152 --> 09:51.619
trembling the way you were
trembling out there tonight

09:51.655 --> 09:53.220
is not being at your best.

09:53.256 --> 09:54.856
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

09:54.891 --> 09:56.694
James.

09:56.719 --> 09:59.753
You're embarrassing yourself,
being so petulant.

09:59.778 --> 10:02.044
I'm just concerned about you.

10:04.794 --> 10:05.960
All right.

10:07.950 --> 10:09.283
You're right.

10:11.254 --> 10:12.786
I'll take it.

10:21.307 --> 10:23.074
Did you give Rose some cash?

10:23.109 --> 10:25.309
I tried, but she wouldn't take it.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.374
I'll tell Maricel.

10:28.408 --> 10:29.918
We can't keep asking
that girl to sit for us

10:29.942 --> 10:31.142
if she won't take the money.

10:31.177 --> 10:32.976
It doesn't feel right.

10:33.012 --> 10:34.622
And she didn't even really
get him down tonight anyway,

10:34.646 --> 10:35.711
so what are we paying for?

10:37.215 --> 10:39.015
I don't know.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.517
It's all so hard.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.299
Well...

10:46.992 --> 10:48.825
if you don't want to tonight...

10:49.936 --> 10:51.703
It's not that I don't want to.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.772
It just feels strange to make a plan.

10:58.111 --> 10:59.477
I hear that.

11:01.602 --> 11:03.702
So, it's okay if we don't?

11:04.812 --> 11:07.044
Yeah. Yeah.

11:07.069 --> 11:09.134
We will soon.

11:09.795 --> 11:10.795
I promise.

11:32.596 --> 11:34.129
Welcome to Calvary.

11:34.164 --> 11:35.796
God bless you. How you doing?

11:35.832 --> 11:36.964
All right. Amen. Amen.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.432
Yes... yes, ma'am. I got you.

11:38.467 --> 11:40.934
Good to see you.
All right, welcome, welcome.

11:40.969 --> 11:43.270
Brother Watkins, how are you doing?
Good to see you.

11:43.305 --> 11:46.006
Miss McMillan. Amen, amen.
How you doing? Welcome.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.031
Revive. Recommit. Renew. All right.

11:48.058 --> 11:51.193
And then he says he's Darryl James's boy

11:51.228 --> 11:53.562
and that I'm going down.

11:53.598 --> 11:55.078
As if I'm the one who killed the man.

11:55.205 --> 11:56.571
Does Jacob know about this?

11:56.596 --> 11:58.279
He knows Basie thinks it.

11:59.322 --> 12:01.722
None of us know
if he's really Darryl's son.

12:02.402 --> 12:04.893
As far as I know,
Darryl didn't have a son.

12:04.918 --> 12:06.284
Just the two girls.

12:06.329 --> 12:08.030
But that doesn't much matter.

12:08.055 --> 12:09.888
He thinks he's Darryl's son.

12:11.156 --> 12:13.724
And that church is going up like bamboo.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.058
Unless it's not.

12:16.181 --> 12:17.269
Meaning?

12:17.319 --> 12:19.120
My son Aaron has been doing
a lot of zoning law

12:19.144 --> 12:20.711
over in Nashville.

12:20.980 --> 12:22.815
We can have him come over here
for the weekend,

12:22.839 --> 12:24.272
see what he thinks about this.

12:24.624 --> 12:26.572
He might be able to stop it.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.257
Slow it down, anyway.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.707
Let's get him on the phone.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.951
Revival!

13:49.987 --> 13:53.121
It is time for revival.

13:53.157 --> 13:54.944
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

13:55.097 --> 13:56.963
This is revival.

13:56.998 --> 13:59.499
And can we get some love
for my daughter Charity

13:59.535 --> 14:01.067
and Mr. Jabari Johnson?

14:02.250 --> 14:04.304
What wonderful music.

14:05.668 --> 14:08.936
This is my favorite
time of the year.

14:10.539 --> 14:12.773
Revival.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.875
What a blessing that
we have it to come back to.

14:15.900 --> 14:16.829
- Yes!
- Yes!

14:16.854 --> 14:19.229
A time to reconnect, re-dedicate.

14:19.254 --> 14:21.820
- Yeah!
- A time to be forgiven,

14:22.009 --> 14:25.778
restored, and embraced in the fullness

14:25.803 --> 14:27.303
of all His blessing.

14:27.328 --> 14:28.427
Amen!

14:28.452 --> 14:30.625
A time to join hand-in-hand

14:31.659 --> 14:33.926
with old friends,

14:33.951 --> 14:35.251
family,

14:35.276 --> 14:38.209
and to commune with the family of God.

14:38.234 --> 14:39.214
Amen.

14:39.239 --> 14:40.354
Now this year,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.846
we thought it best
if we open up your hearts

14:42.871 --> 14:44.638
with a... with a smile.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.849
So, without further ado,

14:47.139 --> 14:49.373
I want you to give a warm
Calvary welcome

14:49.408 --> 14:53.610
as I turn the pulpit over
to Reverend Richard Adenoids.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.813
Thank you, Bishop.

14:57.848 --> 14:59.348
Thank you so much.

14:59.384 --> 15:00.773
Thank you, Bishop.
Did I say thank you, Bishop?

15:00.797 --> 15:01.911
I'm saying it again. Thank you, Bishop.

15:01.935 --> 15:05.069
And thank you, first ladies. Thank you.

15:05.094 --> 15:07.060
And thank my second lady
for not showing up.

15:07.297 --> 15:10.031
This will not take long,
will not take long at all.

15:10.056 --> 15:11.895
About...

15:11.920 --> 15:14.053
about... about two hours, to be exact.

15:14.078 --> 15:16.745
I'd like to say good evening
to the members of the band,

15:16.770 --> 15:18.537
the members of the choir,

15:18.562 --> 15:20.762
and the people who are still
wearing Members Only jackets.

15:20.786 --> 15:21.999
Amen to that.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.919
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:28.193 --> 15:31.228
So, you sounded good up there tonight.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.697
Thank you.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.132
It felt so good.

15:36.402 --> 15:38.135
Now we just have to do it again tomorrow

15:38.170 --> 15:41.405
and the next night and the next.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.246
Does Jabari perform
with all his artists like that?

15:48.052 --> 15:49.548
Sometimes.

15:49.583 --> 15:50.715
I think so. Why?

15:51.953 --> 15:53.352
Just curious.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.175
If he wasn't in town
mastering the record,

15:55.211 --> 15:56.088
he wouldn't have been here.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.577
But he was.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.275
So it made sense.

15:59.311 --> 16:01.611
Charity, is there something
going on between you two?

16:01.646 --> 16:04.347
What? No!

16:04.382 --> 16:05.554
Kevin, are you crazy?

16:05.590 --> 16:06.725
Just seems like there is.

16:06.992 --> 16:08.302
The way you two look
in each other's eyes

16:08.326 --> 16:09.436
up there on stage like that.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.594
It's called performing!

16:11.629 --> 16:13.129
And the spirit.

16:13.165 --> 16:14.597
What are you doing?

16:14.632 --> 16:15.931
I'm not doing anything, Charity.

16:28.749 --> 16:30.849
Did you enjoy dinner?

16:30.884 --> 16:32.883
I enjoyed it very much.

16:32.919 --> 16:35.686
That's good. You know, I could
do a little something-something.

16:35.722 --> 16:37.621
- I was impressed.
- Come here.

16:52.491 --> 16:54.156
Have a great night.

17:06.731 --> 17:09.265
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you?

17:09.300 --> 17:11.367
You don't know me.
My name is Grace Greenleaf.

17:11.403 --> 17:13.180
- I just... I want to make sure...
- Lorraine!

17:13.204 --> 17:14.882
- Lorraine, go home.
- He's a child molester.

17:14.906 --> 17:16.404
Do you know how many girls
he's molested?

17:16.424 --> 17:17.534
- Go home.
- Grace Greenleaf,

17:17.558 --> 17:18.690
Calvary Fellowship.

17:18.726 --> 17:20.092
- You call me...
- Stop it!

17:20.127 --> 17:21.992
Stop it!

17:22.029 --> 17:25.063
I'm trying to start over,
getting my life together.

17:25.098 --> 17:26.864
Just leave me alone.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.511
That's never going to happen.

17:29.236 --> 17:31.436
And you call yourself a Christian.

17:49.175 --> 17:50.840
I think I found a silver bullet

17:50.875 --> 17:52.675
for that werewolf Basie Skanks.

17:52.710 --> 17:54.144
Ooh.

17:54.179 --> 17:56.212
Aaron's flying in from Nashville.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.614
Lionel's son?

17:58.650 --> 18:01.651
Lionel and I are going
to sit down with him tonight,

18:01.686 --> 18:04.154
walk him through this whole mess
with Basie Skanks,

18:04.189 --> 18:05.488
get his take.

18:05.523 --> 18:08.781
Apparently, he's been
doing work like this...

18:08.990 --> 18:11.057
land use, zoning.

18:11.596 --> 18:14.327
Lionel seems to think
he might have some ideas.

18:16.497 --> 18:18.597
How convenient.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.476
Hey.

18:41.648 --> 18:43.099
Hey.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.566
Sorry about last night.

18:46.601 --> 18:48.005
That's fine.

18:48.019 --> 18:49.508
Doesn't really matter.

18:50.221 --> 18:51.405
Yeah, it does.

18:52.676 --> 18:54.509
I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.220
Thank you.

19:05.969 --> 19:07.872
Was that a smile?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.831
Yeah, I think so.

19:11.005 --> 19:13.157
What are you so happy about?

19:13.540 --> 19:15.407
What are you so happy about?

19:15.442 --> 19:17.242
Was that the first one?

19:17.277 --> 19:18.709
I think so.

19:21.181 --> 19:23.415
- Yeah.
- Look at Daddy.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.250
Give me a smile, little man.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.642
- Yeah, but I remember.
- But you roll with it. Okay.

19:29.678 --> 19:32.077
And so here's what
I'm going to say to you.

19:32.113 --> 19:34.647
Now, do you remember
that sermon that you did

19:34.683 --> 19:36.482
about pomegranates and bells?

19:36.518 --> 19:38.518
That was so good.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.456
Everyone always remembers that sermon.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.181
Yeah. I think it's the reason
why I went to Bible school.

19:43.235 --> 19:44.367
Really?

19:44.403 --> 19:46.436
And I also have you to blame

19:46.471 --> 19:48.971
for all of my troubles with
the deacon board down there.

19:49.006 --> 19:50.973
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.850
That was my fault.

19:54.011 --> 19:55.878
It's nice to be with you.

19:55.914 --> 19:57.126
You too, baby.

19:57.151 --> 19:59.851
Hey, why haven't you
been preaching anymore?

20:00.251 --> 20:02.969
I was surprised when I heard about that.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.502
I don't know.

20:05.702 --> 20:07.870
I feel like Daddy's got it
well handled right now.

20:09.665 --> 20:11.099
Honestly, I just... I don't know

20:11.124 --> 20:12.723
that I feel called to it lately.

20:13.229 --> 20:14.970
You're still called to it, Grace.

20:14.995 --> 20:16.720
You're just not feeling it.

20:17.901 --> 20:19.400
So, what's really going on with you?

20:24.232 --> 20:26.164
Pastor, excuse me.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.866
Yeah, Darlene?

20:27.901 --> 20:30.836
There's some officers here
to see you about something.

20:39.585 --> 20:41.085
Is everything okay?

20:57.502 --> 20:59.749
Why are you looking at me that way?

21:00.338 --> 21:03.506
James was just thumbing
through a Nashville edition

21:03.541 --> 21:06.676
on super lawyers
and happened on Aaron's name?

21:06.711 --> 21:08.243
What do you think you're doing?

21:08.278 --> 21:09.301
Mae...

21:09.337 --> 21:11.035
No, seriously.

21:11.071 --> 21:14.416
Lionel, what are you thinking?

21:14.451 --> 21:16.625
Mae, James told me all about the saga

21:16.650 --> 21:18.691
with Triumph Two and Basie Skanks.

21:19.342 --> 21:20.551
I'm just trying to help.

21:20.576 --> 21:23.576
My husband doesn't need your help.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.440
And neither do I.

21:26.257 --> 21:27.374
What you think?

21:27.399 --> 21:29.033
You're just going to swoop
in here and save me,

21:29.057 --> 21:31.090
prove to me that I should
have run off with you

21:31.115 --> 21:33.048
when I had a chance?

21:33.169 --> 21:35.710
That whole thing was a mistake.

21:35.735 --> 21:37.201
We both know that.

21:37.226 --> 21:38.693
At least I do.

21:42.380 --> 21:43.845
Mae, what do you want me to do?

21:43.881 --> 21:45.712
You want me to call Aaron
and tell him not to come?

21:45.736 --> 21:47.436
No.

21:47.461 --> 21:48.761
No.

21:52.364 --> 21:53.731
It's just...

21:59.137 --> 22:01.904
Please. Please.

22:02.961 --> 22:04.927
I am sorry I upset you.

22:05.359 --> 22:06.496
Are you?

22:06.531 --> 22:08.598
Yes, I am.

22:13.216 --> 22:16.632
Listen, I'll preach this sermon tonight.

22:16.854 --> 22:20.055
Aaron will weigh in
on your Triumph problem.

22:20.245 --> 22:23.112
And we'll be both on our way.

22:23.137 --> 22:24.137
Okay?

22:26.877 --> 22:28.209
Okay?

22:28.538 --> 22:30.537
Thank you.

22:47.994 --> 22:49.292
<i>So, what's going on here?</i>

22:49.328 --> 22:50.761
Is he pressing charges or not?

22:50.796 --> 22:52.562
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

22:52.598 --> 22:54.197
He says he's been hesitant to do so

22:54.233 --> 22:55.733
out of concern for your mother.

22:55.768 --> 22:57.601
But if you continue to harass him,

22:57.637 --> 22:58.715
I have a feeling he will.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.862
Did Mr. McCready mention
when he made this complaint

23:00.898 --> 23:03.631
that he raped my sister
and about a dozen other women?

23:03.658 --> 23:04.958
We're not here to discuss that.

23:05.415 --> 23:08.294
We're here to protect you, Pastor,

23:08.330 --> 23:10.663
and to keep you from getting
yourself into trouble.

23:10.698 --> 23:12.065
Just stay off his street.

23:21.877 --> 23:24.011
Now, when Bishop
Geoffrey speaks tonight, Lord,

23:24.046 --> 23:26.347
let it be Your words
the saints hear, not his.

23:26.382 --> 23:30.052
Let him hide behind the cross,
and give You all the glory.

23:30.077 --> 23:32.098
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

23:32.123 --> 23:33.555
Amen.

23:34.529 --> 23:36.142
Yes, Karine?

23:37.171 --> 23:38.804
Mr. Geoffrey's here.

23:38.829 --> 23:40.056
Our prayers have been answered.

23:40.064 --> 23:42.565
- I don't know about all that.
- Come here, boy.

23:44.065 --> 23:45.664
Now, this is Bishop Geoffrey's son.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.540
He's going to be doing
some consulting with us.

23:48.247 --> 23:49.468
Say hey to Mae. Come on.

23:49.503 --> 23:51.668
- Lady Mae.
- Come. Look at you.

23:51.704 --> 23:53.337
Handsome as you can be. Welcome.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.773
Thank you.

23:55.809 --> 23:56.873
Pops.

23:57.559 --> 23:59.280
Good evening, Calvary!

24:01.234 --> 24:03.782
Tonight, I am so excited to bring out

24:03.807 --> 24:06.889
two great friends of Calvary Fellowship.

24:06.942 --> 24:09.175
They flew here all the way
from Los Angeles

24:09.211 --> 24:11.677
to be with us tonight.

24:11.713 --> 24:13.746
So, Calvary, please help me

24:13.781 --> 24:17.817
welcome back our friends Mary Mary!

24:22.468 --> 24:23.932
How many of you believe that 2017

24:23.968 --> 24:25.934
is going to be your season?

24:27.872 --> 24:30.606
And you're going to get
everything that God has for you?

24:30.642 --> 24:33.075
- Amen.
- Then stand to your feet,

24:33.110 --> 24:35.844
give God some praise and help us
sing this song tonight.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.280
Yeah.

25:45.537 --> 25:47.336
I don't know why I'm watching this.

25:48.578 --> 25:49.710
Neither do I.

25:55.625 --> 25:59.093
<i>Let us skip down to the 40th verse.</i>

25:59.129 --> 26:02.096
"Then he cometh unto his disciples

26:02.132 --> 26:04.865
and findeth them sleeping."

26:04.900 --> 26:07.649
- Amen.
- Then, in verse 43...

26:08.448 --> 26:12.317
"And he came and found them
asleep again,

26:12.352 --> 26:14.952
for their eyes were heavy."

26:14.988 --> 26:18.723
And we know that Jesus
came back a third time,

26:18.758 --> 26:22.811
and found them asleep again.

26:24.745 --> 26:27.679
You are in the worst pain
of your entire life,

26:27.714 --> 26:31.383
and everyone around you is sleeping.

26:32.046 --> 26:36.420
People you depend on
for counsel, sleeping.

26:36.455 --> 26:37.664
- My Lord!
- Come on, now.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.248
Prayer warriors, sleeping.

26:40.561 --> 26:43.963
The deacon board, sleeping.

26:45.265 --> 26:48.433
And your spouse, sleeping.

26:48.529 --> 26:51.463
Church, sleeping.

26:51.806 --> 26:53.225
And you?

26:53.500 --> 26:55.834
You are all alone,

26:55.935 --> 26:58.057
full with pain.

26:59.092 --> 27:01.618
The only one awake who sees it all.

27:02.062 --> 27:03.819
But let me tell you something.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.992
All of you who are suffering,

27:07.027 --> 27:09.429
you are not alone.

27:09.749 --> 27:13.327
Even in the wee hours, you're not alone.

27:13.363 --> 27:15.463
The story in this Good Book proves it.

27:15.498 --> 27:19.500
Because Jesus knew what it was like.

27:19.536 --> 27:21.836
Jesus knows all.

27:21.872 --> 27:25.172
And you are not alone.

27:26.995 --> 27:30.092
Thanks to the sweet grace of Jesus,

27:30.126 --> 27:31.625
you are not alone.

27:39.635 --> 27:41.935
See, the thing is,
their construction site

27:41.971 --> 27:43.670
is situated on a floodplain.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.341
So if a storm of Katrina's
proportion was to hit,

27:46.366 --> 27:47.566
they'd be screwed.

27:47.591 --> 27:49.356
- Okay.
- And what about Calvary?

27:49.381 --> 27:50.496
Are we on the same floodplain?

27:50.520 --> 27:52.253
Technically, yes, but you guys built

27:52.278 --> 27:54.638
before the restrictions I'm
talking about were put in place.

27:54.790 --> 27:57.057
- What does that mean?
- It means that you could file

27:57.082 --> 27:58.681
a temporary injunction and make sure

27:58.706 --> 28:00.297
that they're in compliance with the law.

28:00.321 --> 28:02.822
It'd stop them for 28 days, anyway.

28:03.918 --> 28:05.418
Well, what if that doesn't work?

28:05.443 --> 28:06.867
Then you could theoretically

28:06.888 --> 28:08.989
keep filing injunction after injunction

28:09.024 --> 28:11.325
until they suffer from
significant financial hardship

28:11.360 --> 28:13.026
and basically give up.

28:14.562 --> 28:15.885
What do you think?

28:15.910 --> 28:17.375
We've got to do something.

28:17.832 --> 28:19.325
I could set up the paperwork

28:19.350 --> 28:20.681
and you guys can decide at a later date.

28:20.705 --> 28:21.705
No.

28:22.950 --> 28:24.311
Let's do it.

28:24.992 --> 28:25.992
It's time.

28:42.796 --> 28:44.396
You scared me.

28:45.678 --> 28:46.743
Sorry.

28:49.222 --> 28:51.088
Well...

28:51.113 --> 28:52.913
he is down.

28:52.938 --> 28:54.505
Thanks for doing that.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.273
What were you listening to?

29:02.315 --> 29:04.641
The mastered version of my record.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.866
Jabari just sent it over.

29:10.729 --> 29:11.794
How is it?

29:12.732 --> 29:13.764
Good.

29:14.860 --> 29:16.226
I think it's good.

29:17.829 --> 29:18.895
I'm sure it is.

29:37.508 --> 29:38.941
Kevin...

29:40.117 --> 29:41.483
Kevie.

29:41.508 --> 29:42.641
Yeah.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.673
I can't do this.

29:51.377 --> 29:53.609
You haven't even given it a chance.

29:53.634 --> 29:55.167
That's the point.

29:57.407 --> 30:00.021
I want to give it a chance.

30:01.213 --> 30:03.914
I want to want to, and I don't.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.271
It should happen naturally,

30:09.296 --> 30:12.264
and it just doesn't feel
that way anymore.

30:15.245 --> 30:18.046
I can't go on pretending
to be something we aren't.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.911
It's over.

30:39.196 --> 30:40.628
This is over.

31:11.586 --> 31:13.287
I took my medicine today.

31:14.502 --> 31:15.967
I can tell.

31:20.054 --> 31:21.367
Baby...

31:21.392 --> 31:24.960
I am so sorry that you have
to deal with this.

31:24.985 --> 31:27.831
- It must be so hard.
- It's nothing

31:27.856 --> 31:30.056
compared to the trouble
we're about to give Basie.

31:31.882 --> 31:33.649
I guess so.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.918
Look, things are going to work out, Mae.

31:39.890 --> 31:42.591
We've been through worse.

31:45.002 --> 31:47.369
It hurts me to see you cry.

31:54.317 --> 31:56.017
I'll be fine.

31:57.154 --> 31:58.319
I will.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.304
Baby, what you looking at?

32:25.408 --> 32:27.042
Rebecca was right.

32:28.579 --> 32:30.479
You guys were good.

32:37.259 --> 32:38.391
Yeah, we were.

33:16.417 --> 33:17.617
Hey.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.634
Any more smiles?

33:24.025 --> 33:25.815
Not yet.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.808
But we'll see some. I have faith.

33:38.371 --> 33:40.328
What are we going to tell people?

33:41.597 --> 33:43.198
Nothing right now.

33:44.545 --> 33:47.045
- Unless you...
- No.

33:47.434 --> 33:48.700
No.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.072
We'll figure it out.

34:23.815 --> 34:25.947
What a week this has been.

34:27.649 --> 34:31.618
Now, I don't know about you,
but I feel renewed,

34:31.652 --> 34:34.321
revived, and recommitted.

34:36.192 --> 34:37.657
Now, at this time,

34:37.693 --> 34:39.963
I would like to open up
the doors of the church

34:39.987 --> 34:43.321
to anyone out there
looking for a new church home,

34:43.346 --> 34:46.013
or anyone looking to dedicate

34:46.038 --> 34:48.743
or re-dedicate their life to Christ.

34:48.768 --> 34:51.069
- Amen.
- That's why we do this.

34:51.094 --> 34:53.061
This is what revival is all about.

34:53.085 --> 34:55.119
- Yes.
- And for those out there

34:55.143 --> 34:58.344
who might be feeling shy,
well, let me fix that right now.

34:58.369 --> 35:02.871
Everybody turn to your neighbor and say,

35:02.896 --> 35:04.363
"I walk with you."

35:04.388 --> 35:06.821
Because that's the whole deal here.

35:06.846 --> 35:09.119
When you're in the family of God,

35:09.144 --> 35:12.212
you never have to walk alone.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.604
Now, go on. Turn and do it.

35:14.808 --> 35:16.488
- I'll walk with you.
- I'll walk with you.

35:17.052 --> 35:18.127
That's right, come on.

35:18.152 --> 35:19.989
- I'll walk with you too, baby.
- Come on down.

35:20.013 --> 35:21.247
How does it work?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.359
It's easy. I'll show you.

35:23.384 --> 35:25.761
The arms of God are wide open.

35:25.802 --> 35:29.537
Come to the well
that will never run dry.

35:29.572 --> 35:31.704
Jesus Christ!

35:31.740 --> 35:33.005
Come on down.

35:33.041 --> 35:34.974
Hallelujah.

35:35.009 --> 35:37.247
Hallelujah.

35:37.287 --> 35:40.321
Praise God. Praise God!

35:44.768 --> 35:47.902
Grandpa, I want to get baptized.

35:47.927 --> 35:49.826
Nothing would make me happier.

35:51.367 --> 35:52.533
Yes! Yes!

35:57.339 --> 35:59.973
- Baby?
- Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

36:02.044 --> 36:03.544
Lord.

36:31.107 --> 36:32.239
Are you ready, child?

36:45.436 --> 36:48.973
Is the Lord, Jesus Christ,
your lord and savior?

36:49.742 --> 36:51.674
He is.

36:52.191 --> 36:55.724
Then upon your profession
of faith in Jesus Christ,

36:56.253 --> 36:57.954
Sophia...

36:57.979 --> 37:01.113
it is my joy and privilege

37:01.138 --> 37:04.139
to baptize you in the name
of the Father and the Son

37:04.164 --> 37:05.664
and the Holy Ghost.

37:07.867 --> 37:09.733
Buried in the likeness of his death

37:10.122 --> 37:13.147
and raised in the likeness
of his resurrection

37:13.297 --> 37:17.033
to walk in the newness of life.

37:17.221 --> 37:19.288
Now hold your nose.

37:19.313 --> 37:21.280
Now I want you to lean all the way back.

37:21.305 --> 37:22.537
All the way.

37:22.562 --> 37:24.863
I got you, okay?

37:35.745 --> 37:37.545
Okay? Okay.

37:48.771 --> 37:50.470
Thank you so much. God bless y'all.

37:50.495 --> 37:51.594
You, too.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.218
Honey!

37:58.850 --> 38:00.850
How are you feeling?

38:01.222 --> 38:02.936
It's hard to describe.

38:02.961 --> 38:04.993
Try. Try.

38:05.018 --> 38:06.784
Um...

38:06.927 --> 38:08.627
well...

38:13.028 --> 38:14.360
infinite.

38:20.107 --> 38:21.539
Yeah, I like that.

38:23.817 --> 38:25.216
Can I call Zora to tell her?

38:25.241 --> 38:27.574
Yeah, baby. Yeah, go, go. Go, go.

38:29.435 --> 38:30.668
Thanks, Mom.

38:31.979 --> 38:33.578
I love you.

38:35.336 --> 38:37.669
I love you, honey.

38:37.694 --> 38:39.026
I love you.

38:39.051 --> 38:40.216
Go. Go have fun.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.536
I'm glad you came.

38:45.561 --> 38:47.194
It was my pleasure.

38:47.219 --> 38:49.752
And it was wonderful
hearing you preach again.

38:49.777 --> 38:52.577
I needed to hear that message.

38:52.602 --> 38:54.502
It means a lot coming from you.

38:59.197 --> 39:00.964
Aaron has an idea.

39:00.989 --> 39:03.656
Well, I should be used to it by now.

39:03.681 --> 39:05.815
All right, what's your idea, Mr. Aaron?

39:05.840 --> 39:08.506
Well, I could work remotely
for all my clients in Nashville

39:08.531 --> 39:11.332
if it would help for me
to stay here for a while.

39:11.489 --> 39:13.121
No...

39:13.146 --> 39:14.578
Jacob's room is sitting empty.

39:19.642 --> 39:20.808
Okay.

39:20.833 --> 39:22.233
- It's a deal.
- All right.

39:22.258 --> 39:23.790
Go to Nashville and pack a bag.

39:23.815 --> 39:25.115
Yes, sir. Thank you.

39:25.140 --> 39:27.940
Lady Mae, bye.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.698
- Mae.
- Aaron. Lionel.

39:30.723 --> 39:32.990
Lionel.

39:35.864 --> 39:38.332
And, Lionel, thank you again.

39:38.357 --> 39:39.858
Thank you both.

39:46.367 --> 39:48.634
Now, I was thinking,

39:48.659 --> 39:51.125
we could take Sophia to Iris for lunch.

39:51.553 --> 39:53.972
Well, that sounds like a beautiful idea.

39:53.997 --> 39:56.380
No, it's a selfish idea. I'm starving.

39:56.405 --> 39:57.805
I'll go get my things.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.063
All right.

40:29.702 --> 40:31.202
Thank you for coming.

40:31.237 --> 40:34.171
Sure. What's the problem?

40:34.207 --> 40:36.673
It's more like what's the solution?

40:36.709 --> 40:38.441
Okay.
