WEBVTT

00:06.125 --> 00:08.791
A NETWORK ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.250 --> 00:16.083
No, no. I am not getting inside there.

00:17.000 --> 00:17.833
Take the bottle.

00:17.916 --> 00:20.333
That's a mousetrap.
We won't get out of there.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.791
That's our entrance.
We'll do it through hard work.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.541
What the fuck is that smell?

00:24.916 --> 00:27.416
They must have thrown pesticide in there,

00:27.500 --> 00:30.750
bleach and toxic substances for humans.
I'm not going in.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.000
-It's just water.
-Yes, toxic water.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.333
Sit down, come on.

00:34.416 --> 00:36.375
I'll sit down, but I won't go in.

00:36.458 --> 00:37.291
Let's go.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.666
It's easier to train in a swimming pool,
but our job isn't in a fucking pool.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.041
It will be a lot harder than this.

00:44.958 --> 00:46.583
And way scarier than getting in there.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.416
I'm not afraid.

00:51.541 --> 00:52.916
You're shitting your pants.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.041
And it's because you're a father now.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.000
Look.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.750
I agree with you there, Bogotá.

01:03.708 --> 01:07.083
You were so reckless before,
and you can't do that anymore.

01:07.708 --> 01:10.375
In the past, when shit happened,
I was the only one fucked up by it.

01:10.458 --> 01:11.333
You know that.

01:11.958 --> 01:13.750
Now, I don't want to do certain things.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.625
For example, getting inside a cistern.

01:15.708 --> 01:16.541
I don't want to.

01:17.666 --> 01:19.708
Do you know what it means
to be a good father?

01:20.250 --> 01:21.458
I don't know anymore.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.875
Behaving in the exact same way
when you weren't a father.

01:26.041 --> 01:29.708
Of course, and leave the after-party
still high in the morning.

01:29.791 --> 01:33.375
If you like to get high on Wednesdays,
you have to keep doing it.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.083
Come on!

01:36.083 --> 01:38.458
You have to,
or you will end up hating your son.

01:38.916 --> 01:41.666
And that would really make you
a bad father. Believe me.

01:42.708 --> 01:45.291
Oh, my God. Do you know
what you can do, Bogotá?

01:45.375 --> 01:47.083
You can write a novel.

01:48.041 --> 01:48.958
Yes.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.166
How to be a father without getting clean.

01:53.541 --> 01:54.833
You don't have kids, do you?

01:56.541 --> 01:57.375
I have seven.

01:59.791 --> 02:01.916
-Wow.
-The next one will come with a prize.

02:03.666 --> 02:06.916
This is Emilio, the oldest.
He lives in Venezuela. Julián, he's in DF.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.333
He is growing a mustache.
He calls me "dude."

02:09.416 --> 02:11.750
This bastard's a riot. Erik, in Iceland.

02:12.416 --> 02:13.958
Hanna, in Finland. Violinist.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.166
She's a beauty.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.333
Drazen in Montenegro. He's fucking dull.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.166
Yaris, in Thessaloniki, a real character.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.083
Ivanna. Bad-tempered as hell,

02:23.166 --> 02:25.208
but she's an artist. She lives in Odessa.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.083
Seven.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.416
And the next one with a prize.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.916
Sometimes I'm embarrassed for you.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.666
Hey! I take care of all of them.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.500
But I don't stop being me.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.750
Do I go to their school plays

02:40.833 --> 02:43.416
or the games of whatever sport
they play in Iceland?

02:44.250 --> 02:45.083
No, I don't.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.083
But I do randomly show up after six months

02:48.166 --> 02:50.958
and I don't ask them for anything.
Not even a hug or their love.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.333
But they jump on me
and cover me with kisses.

02:54.416 --> 02:55.250
Why?

02:56.875 --> 02:58.083
I don't know why.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.875
Because I'm their fucking father.

03:00.833 --> 03:01.958
Their father.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.125
You can't deny your own DNA.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.833
Never.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.541
If you were a robber, you're still one.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.291
And if you used to risk your life,

03:13.375 --> 03:14.583
keep risking it.

03:26.958 --> 03:28.750
My babies, my babies...

03:29.541 --> 03:31.208
Look what I brought.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.666
A sweet set of earring for myself.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.083
See?

03:37.708 --> 03:40.166
Golden, golden! Sweet gold!

03:41.375 --> 03:43.166
You want them for yourself, don't you?

03:43.250 --> 03:45.208
-Give them to me.
-Here, here.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.833
You've never seen anything like it.

03:46.916 --> 03:48.208
Let's go to work.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.000
We're not done yet.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.458
Open the door for Bogotá.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.333
Come on. The worst is in the past.

03:59.916 --> 04:01.166
Now the fun begins.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.625
You look hot in that neoprene.

04:08.041 --> 04:08.875
What?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.833
Your butt looks smoking hot
in that tight suit.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.791
What's going to be real tight
is the skin from your balls.

04:15.041 --> 04:15.875
Rude fuck.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.333
I am not laughing.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.458
Why do you talk to me like that?

04:20.916 --> 04:21.750
Why?

04:22.333 --> 04:24.083
Here on this job, I am your boss.

04:25.916 --> 04:27.500
Yes, boss. I'm sorry.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.250
Let's not disrespect each other.

04:30.916 --> 04:31.958
Change the bottle!

04:32.583 --> 04:33.625
And you...

04:33.708 --> 04:35.291
Hurry up, come on!

04:35.541 --> 04:37.458
I want those ovens working ASAP.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.708
And the smoke extractors connected.

04:39.958 --> 04:43.416
We're going to melt all the gold
from the fucking national reserve.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.833
And you! The lance and the bathyscaphe.

04:45.916 --> 04:46.875
Absolute priority.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.708
And don't ruffle my feathers again.

04:50.666 --> 04:54.166
Hurry up, gentlemen! Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

04:54.416 --> 04:55.708
Enjoy yourselves!

04:56.458 --> 04:59.125
Let's earn our sandwiches! Come on!

05:18.875 --> 05:21.250
<i>The first time I heard</i>
<i>one could make fire underwater</i>

05:21.333 --> 05:22.916
<i>was in the Monastery of San Giovanni.</i>

05:23.958 --> 05:27.083
<i>I thought it was as improbable</i>
<i>as the fact that I was there,</i>

05:27.166 --> 05:28.916
<i>listening to Gregorian chants.</i>

05:29.708 --> 05:33.958
<i>But when I was told it was possible thanks</i>
<i>to the oxygen bubbles covering the fire,</i>

05:34.041 --> 05:37.083
<i>I thought it was a beautiful way</i>
<i>of blowing up what we went there for:</i>

05:38.333 --> 05:42.541
<i>A safe in which no one could have gotten</i>
<i>into with all those gold bars.</i>

05:56.833 --> 06:00.000
They entered by impersonating the First
Squad of BRIPAC's Sixth Company.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.083
The real one arrived a few minutes later.

06:03.708 --> 06:04.875
Well, fuck me...

06:05.291 --> 06:06.541
They got us good.

06:06.791 --> 06:08.791
They have everyone tapped.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.916
We have to take out everything
that can be bugged.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.500
Anything that can connect to a network
and our phones!

06:13.583 --> 06:16.416
Colonel, let's think about it.
The procedure is to do a sweep.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.833
They can't have everything bugged.

06:17.916 --> 06:20.250
They can hijack whatever they want.
They have a billion euros!

06:20.500 --> 06:22.166
Do you know the budget of UIT?

06:22.250 --> 06:24.041
Sixteen million.
And the whole CNI?

06:24.125 --> 06:26.875
282 million!
282 million against a billion.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.583
They could tap into the intern's phone!

06:28.666 --> 06:31.291
We only have proof that
they've intercepted communications--

06:31.375 --> 06:33.458
These guys even have pictures
of your dick, Ángel!

06:33.541 --> 06:35.958
They even have pictures of that mole
you have on your balls.

06:36.041 --> 06:39.041
<i>Do you want to say hi?</i>
<i>I'm sure they have your mic activated.</i>

06:39.125 --> 06:41.625
Colonel Tamayo,
the usual procedure is to do a sweep.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.541
Everyone, pay attention!

06:45.625 --> 06:47.875
Don't turn on any device that hasn't been

06:47.958 --> 06:50.833
in a box for at least six months.
Not even an Olivetti.

06:50.916 --> 06:53.750
There are no secure networks,
not even the army's or the ministry's.

06:53.833 --> 06:54.875
Total blackout.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.541
And I want all your phones in this bin.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.125
<i>Now!</i>

07:00.458 --> 07:03.000
If you want to call your mommy,
go to a pay phone.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.333
In less than a minute,
we'll be blind and deaf.

07:07.416 --> 07:08.416
<i>Come on, your turn!</i>

07:08.666 --> 07:10.458
He has just fucked us up good.

07:10.541 --> 07:12.250
He's skipping all the protocols.

07:12.458 --> 07:15.625
It's illegal to confiscate phones
without a court order.

07:15.833 --> 07:16.666
Damn!

07:17.750 --> 07:18.750
This changes everything.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.041
<i>Our techs will analyze them</i>
<i>and return them to you</i>

07:21.125 --> 07:22.541
<i>-as soon as possible.</i>
-Let me think.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.041
Antoñanzas, didn't you hear me?

07:26.125 --> 07:28.041
I'm deleting some private things.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.458
It will only be 30 seconds, sir.

07:29.541 --> 07:32.875
For God's sake!
We all know you're seeing Marisol.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.416
Twenty seconds.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.416
Alert level 5.
The CNI's security system is down.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.708
The defense staff's been bugged
and the computers infected

07:39.791 --> 07:40.833
with an unknown virus!

07:41.000 --> 07:44.416
The last thing UIT is going to do
is read the chat you use to jerk off.

07:44.666 --> 07:46.375
Give me your fucking phone!

07:47.208 --> 07:48.416
For God's sake!

07:48.500 --> 07:52.041
I want a screen with the time that's left
before the bank's security gates open.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.125
Come on!

07:53.500 --> 07:54.375
You!

09:02.625 --> 09:03.791
Done.

09:07.708 --> 09:08.541
The gauze.

09:08.625 --> 09:09.500
Yes.

09:12.125 --> 09:13.333
We're almost done.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.375
Done.

09:29.291 --> 09:30.458
<i>Palermo.</i>

09:30.916 --> 09:32.250
<i>Palermo, it's urgent.</i>

09:34.583 --> 09:35.750
Professor. It's Tokyo.

09:37.416 --> 09:38.250
How is Palermo?

09:38.708 --> 09:39.791
Operational, sir.

09:41.041 --> 09:43.583
<i>Listen. They've found out</i>
<i>we have them tapped.</i>

09:43.666 --> 09:45.583
We have to accelerate everything
and remain calm.

09:45.666 --> 09:46.875
Calm?

09:47.208 --> 09:49.208
You can be calm because you're in the van.

09:50.041 --> 09:53.250
We're surrounded by Spain's army here.
We don't know when they will enter.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.625
We don't know through which entrance.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.291
Has Bogotá started?

09:57.875 --> 09:59.625
Yes. He's been down there for a while.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.833
Drilling that door will take longer
than an hour. Maybe more than two.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.333
Professor, how much time is left?

10:17.333 --> 10:18.583
-Fourteen minutes.
-What?

10:19.083 --> 10:20.583
<i>He fucked us and he knows it.</i>

10:20.833 --> 10:22.166
I would try another move.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.416
I even have doubts about Prieto.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.833
But Tamayo is going to skip
all the protocols.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.458
What does that mean?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.541
It means they're going in as soon
as the doors are unlocked.

10:35.291 --> 10:36.125
Good.

10:37.041 --> 10:40.375
Then we have no option
but to use the dolphin. Right?

10:41.416 --> 10:43.250
Exactly. Do you have it?

10:43.875 --> 10:45.000
Yes.

10:45.541 --> 10:46.958
Flipper is here with us.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.625
Colonel, radiofrequency waves
are coming in and out of the bank.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.250
Shortwave signals.

10:56.666 --> 10:58.250
I want to hear them.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.541
What the fuck is that?

11:09.083 --> 11:11.041
It sounds like an encrypted radio system.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.583
Once inside, the big question is:

11:14.458 --> 11:16.458
How will we communicate with each other?

11:17.750 --> 11:18.583
Palermo.

11:22.791 --> 11:23.625
Boom!

11:24.458 --> 11:25.750
A bomb's just exploded.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.416
We're all dead.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.791
Laser sensors.
Technology is wonderful, isn't it?

11:32.583 --> 11:34.916
Internet and hidden
or replicated IP addresses.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.916
With the money we have, we could buy
a satellite in Kazakhstan.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.708
But that would only take us to one place.

11:41.041 --> 11:42.583
The shittiest place.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.125
You fight technology with technology.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.833
In this, the government can win, but...

11:48.333 --> 11:50.875
there's something
in which they can't compete with:

11:52.250 --> 11:53.708
Time travel.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.000
1941.

11:59.666 --> 12:00.541
Made in England.

12:00.916 --> 12:04.166
With these devices, the BBC broadcast
from Great Britain to the whole world.

12:04.708 --> 12:06.791
Shortwave, ladies and gentlemen.

12:07.166 --> 12:10.208
No technology can inhibit such
a frequency. We'll talk through here.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.416
Everyone could listen in on us with that.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.250
Yes, Nairobi. Every moron with
a walkie-talkie will be able to hear us.

12:16.833 --> 12:17.708
But...

12:18.333 --> 12:20.208
will they be able to understand us?

12:20.750 --> 12:21.833
Absolutely not.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.666
Computer encodings.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.750
In the broadcast
and in the reception as well.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.416
These encodings won't be easy.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.916
We will put in 2300 layers.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.750
They can bring
200 million Chinese ballbusters,

12:36.833 --> 12:38.250
and they'd still never decode it.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.875
Synchronization.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.250
Monks. "Come Creator Spirit...

12:50.416 --> 12:52.375
and in our hearts take up Thy rest...

12:54.666 --> 12:56.666
come with Thy grace and heavenly aid."

12:59.166 --> 13:00.375
We'll have them there...

13:00.750 --> 13:02.458
erasing layer after layer.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.500
Cursing our mothers.

13:05.458 --> 13:06.500
A hundred brainiacs

13:07.083 --> 13:08.166
who are desperate.

13:08.625 --> 13:10.833
A waste of public funds for nothing.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.750
Because with every call we make,

13:13.708 --> 13:16.083
we add 2300 more layers.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.500
A call...

13:19.291 --> 13:20.416
and a code.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
A call...

13:22.375 --> 13:23.333
and a code.

13:23.416 --> 13:26.291
If it's a coded system, then decode it!

13:26.375 --> 13:30.500
Bring the whole tech research unit.
They have to start working now!

13:33.291 --> 13:34.125
Very well.

13:34.708 --> 13:39.250
In two minutes, I want everyone
with the vests and masks on.

13:41.166 --> 13:42.541
We will give you guns, too.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.666
Fake guns.

13:44.875 --> 13:45.916
Don't get too excited.

13:49.541 --> 13:50.625
Amanda, right?

13:50.708 --> 13:51.958
-I'm--
-Miguel.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.166
You know my name?

13:53.875 --> 13:56.250
Well, you told the robber before.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.625
One day, I saved your Tupperware.
I don't know if you remember...

14:00.708 --> 14:01.541
No.

14:01.625 --> 14:02.458
I really don't.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.958
Put the vests on now!

14:05.083 --> 14:06.875
Come on, things are going to get tough.

14:07.875 --> 14:08.708
Don't put it on!

14:09.458 --> 14:10.583
What?

14:10.666 --> 14:11.625
Don't put it on.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.500
You all, don't put the vests on!

14:14.583 --> 14:16.375
They want to use us as human shields.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.166
It's true. Don't put it on.

14:20.458 --> 14:21.875
We found him.

14:22.791 --> 14:24.041
The smartest kid in class.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.041
The overachiever.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.500
-No, I am not.
-You aren't?

14:27.958 --> 14:29.000
What's your name?

14:29.083 --> 14:31.625
-Miguel, Miguel.
-Miguel, Miguel.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.250
Miguel, I'm Mr. Denver.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.000
Yes, Mr. Denver. I'm Miguel.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.708
Miguel, do you like movies?

14:37.916 --> 14:39.250
No, sir. I watch TV shows.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.416
Get with the program,

14:41.500 --> 14:43.208
because we're playing "Guess the Movie."

14:43.541 --> 14:44.500
Put the vest on!

14:45.083 --> 14:45.916
Give me that.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.833
It's backwards, Miguel.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.166
Good.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.083
You're going to put this on, too.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.333
If you don't, I will hurt you.

14:57.416 --> 14:58.541
Hurry up!

14:59.583 --> 15:00.416
Good.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.333
I am going to take seven steps.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.333
Then I will shoot.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.500
If you guess the movie
before I turn around,

15:08.583 --> 15:09.708
maybe I won't shoot you.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.000
Mr. Denver...

15:14.833 --> 15:16.666
Miguel is a robot.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.416
One.

15:23.708 --> 15:24.541
Two.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.916
Three. Okay, Miguel,
I will give you another clue.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.875
I am also a robot.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.166
Four.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.583
<i>WALL-E.</i> It's <i>WALL-E.</i>

15:35.666 --> 15:37.583
I come naked from the future, Miguel.

15:37.666 --> 15:39.708
<i>-WALL-E.</i>
-No, no, no.

15:40.416 --> 15:41.708
-No.
<i>-WALL-E?</i>

15:43.125 --> 15:44.625
Are you calling me <i>WALL-E,</i> Miguel?

15:44.875 --> 15:46.000
No, Mr. Denver.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.208
<i>Terminator.</i>

15:51.833 --> 15:52.833
I'm the <i>Terminator.</i>

15:54.583 --> 15:56.041
Hasta la vista, baby.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.541
The show is over!

16:06.625 --> 16:07.958
Come on. Form two lines.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.708
Quickly!

16:10.458 --> 16:11.291
Come on.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.041
Come on, the masks.

16:13.291 --> 16:14.833
Put the vests and the masks on!

16:25.875 --> 16:28.166
Who the fuck forgot
to turn off their phone?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.375
I'm sorry, it's mine.

16:30.166 --> 16:32.833
HIDDEN NUMBER

16:35.625 --> 16:36.500
Yes?

16:36.791 --> 16:39.166
<i>Good morning, Colonel Prieto.</i>
<i>I'm the Professor.</i>

16:39.333 --> 16:40.666
<i>I hope you're feeling better.</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:41.875
Hello, Professor.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.125
<i>I'm sorry for taking you away</i>
<i>from the dentist in such a way.</i>

16:45.208 --> 16:47.875
<i>I hope I'm not bothering you too much.</i>

16:49.791 --> 16:51.583
You are never a bother, Professor.

16:51.750 --> 16:55.083
<i>Colonel, help me,</i>
<i>because I'm a little bit confused.</i>

16:55.625 --> 16:57.500
Are you in charge of the operation?

16:58.916 --> 16:59.958
Or is it Tamayo?

17:02.958 --> 17:04.375
Colonel Tamayo speaking.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.500
<i>From now on, I'm in charge.</i>

17:06.791 --> 17:08.625
It's a pleasure to meet you.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.541
NEGOTIATION

17:12.500 --> 17:15.916
On this occasion, we'll be the ones
making the calls. Never them.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.916
And we'll do it with phones,
but they won't be able to track our calls.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.458
Why?

17:24.625 --> 17:27.541
Because we're going to travel to the past.

17:27.625 --> 17:30.416
I had that one for five years
and I only had to charge it once.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.375
Second-generation phones.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.500
No Internet and especially no GPS.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.791
With these phones,
we will only make one call. Only one,

17:39.041 --> 17:41.625
no more, to an external collaborator.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.291
-Marseille.
-What? The mute guy isn't coming?

17:46.875 --> 17:50.375
-I'm not mute.
-Like your rat that makes these sounds:

17:52.875 --> 17:54.500
It isn't a rat.

17:54.583 --> 17:55.791
Her name is Sofía.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.750
Marseille will have two terminals.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.833
On the first one, he will receive my call.

18:01.416 --> 18:02.458
On the second one,

18:02.541 --> 18:04.875
he will call the only number
in the telephone's contacts:

18:04.958 --> 18:05.958
Colonel Prieto's.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.916
These two phones will be our firewalls.

18:14.791 --> 18:15.708
Archaic.

18:17.916 --> 18:18.791
<i>Rudimentary.</i>

18:22.208 --> 18:23.041
But efficient.

18:26.541 --> 18:31.375
The police can pinpoint the phone
that's emitting the signal

18:31.458 --> 18:33.500
when the call is being made,
and only then.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.916
<i>There's no technology capable of tracking</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:39.875
<i>two mobile phones stuck together in a box</i>

18:40.458 --> 18:42.083
that are constantly on the move.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.625
Besides, without GPS

18:45.958 --> 18:47.916
<i>or Internet, the only thing</i>

18:48.000 --> 18:49.666
<i>they will have is the antenna</i>

18:49.750 --> 18:51.750
<i>that connects to that phone</i>
<i>when the call is placed.</i>

18:52.000 --> 18:53.166
An antenna that's located

18:53.666 --> 18:55.000
<i>in the center of Madrid.</i>

18:55.708 --> 18:57.958
<i>Right under their noses.</i>

18:58.416 --> 19:00.500
<i>That's the only thing they will have.</i>

19:01.083 --> 19:02.291
That means...

19:04.916 --> 19:05.958
they have nothing.

19:06.041 --> 19:07.708
<i>I'm sorry, but we don't know each other,</i>

19:07.791 --> 19:09.416
<i>so I would like to ask you a question.</i>

19:11.208 --> 19:12.125
Are you in love?

19:13.541 --> 19:17.583
I've been married for more than 17 years,
something uncommon nowadays.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.166
<i>That's the irrefutable proof of my love,</i>

19:20.708 --> 19:22.083
-<i>Professor.</i>
-Yes. I see.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.500
However, and excuse me again,
I don't think you are.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.416
Because when someone is in love,
life becomes rose-tinted.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.083
Everything looks beautiful
and one turns into a kind of teddy bear

19:33.166 --> 19:34.541
that smiles constantly.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.291
<i>Someone in love doesn't shout</i>

19:37.375 --> 19:40.458
or insult his coworkers so rudely.
That's why I asked.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.958
I know you've been listening to us,
you piece of shit.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.250
Colonel,

19:46.916 --> 19:48.916
think about the last time you made love.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.041
Look, Professor, you can go to hell
with these bullshit conversations.

19:53.291 --> 19:56.791
Colonel, you've just joined us,
so allow me to remind you what

19:56.875 --> 19:59.666
the first lines of CNI's handbook
say about hostage negotiations.

19:59.750 --> 20:05.958
They literally say: "Listen attentively
to understand the kidnapper's psychology.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.375
Show empathy towards them
and let them know

20:09.958 --> 20:11.625
that you understand their feelings."

20:12.291 --> 20:13.166
Do you know what?

20:13.875 --> 20:15.666
I think you're blind and deaf now.

20:16.750 --> 20:20.208
<i>That's why Prieto's phone rang a second</i>
<i>before he was going to leave.</i>

20:22.125 --> 20:24.916
I'm starting to think
you're really screwed, Professor.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.625
<i>This isn't the paradisal island</i>
<i>where you probably spent your days</i>

20:28.708 --> 20:30.541
after the Royal Mint robbery, am I right?

20:30.625 --> 20:31.875
How did the escape go?

20:32.125 --> 20:33.833
<i>How is Murillo?</i>

20:37.833 --> 20:39.291
Hello, Colonel Tamayo.

20:39.541 --> 20:40.625
<i>Colonel Prieto.</i>

20:42.750 --> 20:43.916
Ángel.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.458
<i>I imagine you're also there listening.</i>

20:54.041 --> 20:57.416
Okay, do you have them there?
Don't lose them.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.750
Hello, Raquel. How are you?

21:00.291 --> 21:02.041
<i>We miss you here in the tent.</i>

21:02.791 --> 21:03.625
Thank you.

21:04.958 --> 21:08.541
And I'm sorry for leaving like that,
without a goodbye.

21:08.958 --> 21:09.791
<i>How are you?</i>

21:10.041 --> 21:11.708
Well, you know me.

21:12.375 --> 21:13.583
I always keep fighting.

21:14.791 --> 21:16.000
And how is Mari Carmen?

21:16.625 --> 21:17.458
Mari Carmen...

21:20.000 --> 21:20.833
She left me.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.833
It took her too long, don't you think?

21:26.666 --> 21:27.791
I'm very sorry, Ángel.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.625
Colonel, the antenna is
on Princesa Street.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.291
Fuck me! They're so close.

21:34.166 --> 21:36.375
Raquel, what the fuck are you doing?

21:36.708 --> 21:38.291
<i>You're throwing your life away.</i>

21:39.166 --> 21:40.000
Look...

21:41.208 --> 21:42.250
This is my new life.

21:43.708 --> 21:44.916
And do you know what?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.583
It's a thousand times better
than the previous one.

21:47.833 --> 21:50.083
Do you think you're living in a movie?

21:50.708 --> 21:51.916
Listen, Raquel.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.458
<i>Movies end, and not always</i>
<i>with a happy ending.</i>

21:57.708 --> 21:59.791
You know I'm going to go after you,
don't you?

22:01.125 --> 22:02.666
That's nothing new.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.875
You've always chased me.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.750
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Colonel, are you still there?

22:10.500 --> 22:12.541
<i>Listen, I am going to call you</i>
<i>in one hour.</i>

22:12.625 --> 22:15.958
By then, I will have released
five hostages.

22:16.041 --> 22:17.708
This time, we'll do things right.

22:18.791 --> 22:22.708
In an hour, I will be smoking a cigar
in your name in the governor's office.

22:24.041 --> 22:26.208
Colonel, I'm recording this conversation.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.541
It sounds like you don't care
about the hostages.

22:28.625 --> 22:32.583
If it's recorded, I am going to give you
some advice, so you won't forget it.

22:32.666 --> 22:35.041
Take your mask, your machine gun,

22:35.125 --> 22:36.125
and get ready.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.875
Because all hell's going to break loose
on your heads.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.458
What do we know about that phone?

22:50.541 --> 22:52.500
They must have made
the call from an old phone.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.708
It was impossible to access
its geolocation,

22:54.791 --> 22:56.833
but the conversation connected
with two antennas.

22:56.916 --> 22:57.916
On Princesa and Callao.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.208
What does that mean?

22:59.291 --> 23:01.958
It could be because there's
a high concentration of people in the area

23:02.041 --> 23:03.458
or they've been on the move.

23:03.958 --> 23:08.000
Are you telling me that they were
on a walk while they were talking to us?

23:08.625 --> 23:12.458
I want all available units deployed
and checking everyone's IDs.

23:12.541 --> 23:15.208
Colonel, we're talking about more
than 400,000 people.

23:15.666 --> 23:18.083
People must be spending
the bills they threw.

23:19.125 --> 23:23.083
And the absence of background noise may
mean they weren't calling from the street.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.958
Maybe it's a basement
or the metro tunnels.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.541
It's impossible to know for sure.

24:07.708 --> 24:08.541
Four hours.

24:21.666 --> 24:24.833
Look at you,
you look so innocent like this.

24:24.916 --> 24:26.625
I want a son like this one.

24:28.250 --> 24:29.083
And these guys?

24:29.166 --> 24:31.416
-What the hell are they doing?
-I don't know.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.541
I think they're breaking records.

24:34.666 --> 24:37.208
Let me tell you,
I think he has to be really weird

24:37.291 --> 24:38.166
as a boyfriend.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.625
What's wrong?

24:46.416 --> 24:47.250
Nothing.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.666
You're having second thoughts, don't you?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.291
Do you want to turn back?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.416
We need to perfect...

25:03.250 --> 25:04.083
the plan.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.708
At least, for...

25:07.333 --> 25:08.166
four months.

25:08.791 --> 25:10.333
-Four months?
-Four months.

25:11.125 --> 25:12.750
What are you going to say to Tokyo?

25:12.833 --> 25:14.916
That the next time she sees Rio,
he'll be a vegetable?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.916
We can't help Rio

25:17.708 --> 25:19.375
with a plan that doesn't work.

25:19.625 --> 25:20.541
It doesn't work?

25:20.625 --> 25:22.625
We've studied it together.
It's a perfect plan.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.166
No, it isn't. It isn't.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.916
Do you know what's wrong with you?

25:29.375 --> 25:30.916
You've become an egomaniac.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.208
You don't trust the plan
because it isn't yours.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.541
It's your brother's plan,
but he did trust you.

25:35.625 --> 25:37.333
Why did you want to join

25:37.791 --> 25:38.958
the robbery so badly?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.916
Why are you so anxious about it?

25:42.000 --> 25:45.333
You're like those people who quit smoking

25:45.416 --> 25:49.208
and then start hating tobacco
and the smoke and people who smoke,

25:49.291 --> 25:51.541
and they become
the biggest Taliban against tobacco.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.416
That's happening to you with the police.

25:54.041 --> 25:56.791
You hate the police
because they destroyed your life,

25:56.875 --> 26:00.125
because they tried
to take your daughter away,

26:00.208 --> 26:02.375
because there's an arrest warrant
issued against you

26:02.458 --> 26:04.416
and you want revenge. Revenge.

26:05.416 --> 26:08.416
And you aren't thinking
about Tokyo, Rio or Berlin.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.625
You're thinking about yourself.
And if that's the case,

26:10.708 --> 26:13.583
then I don't think
you should be part of the plan.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.875
I need more time.

26:27.458 --> 26:28.291
07:48

26:28.375 --> 26:29.583
-07:47
-07:46

26:30.041 --> 26:31.916
Get better, I will take care of this.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.666
-Hello.
-This way, please.

26:41.750 --> 26:42.666
Of course.

26:46.208 --> 26:47.625
At your service, inspector.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.125
You know them.

27:17.333 --> 27:21.458
In the absence of Fonollosa, alias Berlin,
who do think could've taken charge?

27:24.666 --> 27:25.791
Why?

27:27.125 --> 27:28.000
What do you mean?

27:30.333 --> 27:32.041
Why do you care?

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
If we kill whoever is in charge first,

27:37.958 --> 27:39.833
we may not have to kill all of them.

27:41.333 --> 27:42.291
Did I answer you?

27:48.750 --> 27:49.791
Denver.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.916
No doubt. He's the most seasoned.
Moscow's son.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.083
-Denver. Believe me.
-Are you sure?

27:55.166 --> 27:56.458
Absolutely. I know them well.

27:56.541 --> 27:59.000
Look, Helsinki is a war criminal.

27:59.250 --> 28:01.041
He only knows how to obey orders.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.000
Nairobi.

28:03.083 --> 28:06.250
Nairobi staged a coup inside the Mint
and took power from Fonollosa.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.041
The Professor would never
put her in charge.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.666
And Tokyo?

28:09.750 --> 28:10.833
Tokyo...

28:11.250 --> 28:12.625
She's too unstable.

28:12.708 --> 28:15.208
Hot-blooded.
It was her fault that Moscow died. No.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.833
Tokyo couldn't be in charge of anything.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.666
Listen to me. It's Denver.

28:22.875 --> 28:23.708
Denver.

28:41.541 --> 28:42.375
What was that?

28:45.250 --> 28:46.958
To see if you would come talk to me.

28:47.041 --> 28:47.875
Look. It worked.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.500
You're not fine, Denver.

28:52.791 --> 28:53.625
I know.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.250
I know I'm not fine, but not because...

28:56.333 --> 28:59.208
all that shit you told me
about being sexist and all that.

28:59.791 --> 29:00.833
It's something else.

29:10.541 --> 29:11.375
Hey.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.541
What's wrong?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.000
Come on, tell me.

29:21.916 --> 29:23.666
-I know how this ends.
-No.

29:25.083 --> 29:27.791
-No, this doesn't end in any way.
-They killed my father.

29:28.708 --> 29:29.625
And you know it.

29:31.541 --> 29:33.208
And it happened because she

29:33.291 --> 29:35.666
wanted a grand entrance
with a motorcycle. Right, Tokyo?

29:39.041 --> 29:39.875
He was a good man.

29:40.583 --> 29:44.416
And he acted like a father in front
of 200 policemen with an M16 and no vest.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.333
And they killed him.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.208
Do you know what I'm saying?

29:51.916 --> 29:52.833
If you're here,

29:53.791 --> 29:56.666
the same will happen to me,
because I am not cold-blooded.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.583
If I have to stand in the line of fire
to protect you, I will.

30:00.833 --> 30:01.666
I don't care.

30:02.666 --> 30:04.375
Because you're my family, Mónica.

30:05.958 --> 30:06.958
You're my family.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.708
And that's why I didn't want you here.

30:12.666 --> 30:13.583
Do you understand?

30:15.375 --> 30:16.416
Step.

30:17.791 --> 30:20.083
Step, step. Sorry.

30:33.375 --> 30:35.500
Well, I will take care of the Browning.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.791
Very well, Helsinki. Good luck.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.208
Let's go inside.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.833
You, too.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.750
You don't know what you're doing.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.000
As soon as I touch
the door of that chamber,

31:02.083 --> 31:04.166
the security system
will flood it in a few minutes.

31:04.541 --> 31:07.041
It will be flooded? No.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.541
More than 100,000 liters of water
will crush you.

31:09.625 --> 31:11.833
More than 100,000 liters of water,
Nairobi.

31:11.916 --> 31:12.875
Did you hear?

31:13.416 --> 31:15.541
I hope you took a course on snorkeling.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.791
You're wrong if you think
you're dealing with an idiot.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.833
I know where you're taking me.

31:21.708 --> 31:22.541
And why.

31:23.625 --> 31:24.625
And let me tell you,

31:25.916 --> 31:27.208
I won't do it.

31:33.041 --> 31:33.875
Let's go.

31:36.708 --> 31:37.958
Put this on right now.

31:41.041 --> 31:41.875
Please.

32:22.416 --> 32:23.250
Ma'am.

32:24.208 --> 32:25.375
Get out of line.

32:25.458 --> 32:27.708
No, I can, I can. My hands are strong.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.125
Ma'am.

32:33.208 --> 32:35.041
Get out of line, please.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.416
And the rest of you, keep working!

32:40.583 --> 32:41.500
Thank you.

32:42.916 --> 32:44.166
Tokyo.

32:44.458 --> 32:46.791
I watched the other robbery,
glued to the TV.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.625
I know you all.

32:53.833 --> 32:54.666
Sit down.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.500
Helicopters, take off.

33:07.958 --> 33:08.791
Now.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.375
Come on, come on, come on.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.458
Hurry up with those sacks. Don't stop.

33:25.208 --> 33:26.416
If something goes wrong,

33:26.708 --> 33:29.833
then we will find ourselves
in the worst-case scenario.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.875
In which they will start the assault
before we can open

33:32.958 --> 33:34.333
that little door.

33:34.416 --> 33:38.000
And opening that door would take
a lot longer than the first one.

33:38.833 --> 33:41.250
And only he could do this.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.208
A minimum of two hours.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.208
Two hours.

33:47.541 --> 33:50.416
If we haven't opened it
before they enter, then...

33:51.833 --> 33:52.833
We're dead.

33:53.916 --> 33:55.416
But we have a solution.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.833
There's always a solution.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.458
We have this small baby.

33:59.583 --> 34:00.416
A dolphin.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.666
Well, we didn't have more divers.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.208
We're calling him Flipper.

34:05.666 --> 34:06.833
Do you remember Flipper?

34:07.500 --> 34:09.791
The trained dolphin that clapped.

34:10.208 --> 34:11.583
He saved lives, too.

34:11.666 --> 34:13.750
If necessary, he will have to save ours.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.708
The governor of the Bank of Spain
is the only one who can open that door

34:17.791 --> 34:18.916
in three seconds.

34:24.041 --> 34:26.125
With this button,
we balance the jacket's buoyancy.

34:26.208 --> 34:29.833
I will do it. Don't press it
or you will end up stuck on the ceiling.

34:29.916 --> 34:30.791
Hey!

34:30.875 --> 34:32.333
Are you here with us?

34:33.166 --> 34:34.958
We have an emergency respirator.

34:35.041 --> 34:36.458
Hopefully, we won't need to use it.

34:37.833 --> 34:38.666
Hey, look at me.

34:39.833 --> 34:40.708
Look at me!

34:42.333 --> 34:44.791
Once inside,
you'll notice the change of pressure.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.208
Don't get scared and above all,
don't stop breathing.

34:50.041 --> 34:51.291
Yes, but we have a problem.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.625
He won't do it.

34:55.125 --> 34:57.208
His entire biography
says he has principles.

34:58.541 --> 35:00.666
Everyone has principles.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.375
The governor has to ask himself:
"What's more important,

35:03.833 --> 35:05.291
my principles

35:06.625 --> 35:07.458
or my life?"

35:09.250 --> 35:10.708
We're running out of time.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.875
Let's go, let's go.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.583
Governor, any questions?

35:18.083 --> 35:19.083
I'm not going in.

35:19.750 --> 35:20.833
I think you are.

35:20.916 --> 35:22.541
-Get into the bathyscaphe. Now.
-Now.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.208
<i>Assault teams in position.</i>

35:24.291 --> 35:25.541
<i>Armored units waiting.</i>

35:25.916 --> 35:27.000
Gentlemen,

35:27.583 --> 35:29.708
two minutes and thirty seconds.

35:30.583 --> 35:31.500
02:30 02:30

35:31.583 --> 35:32.500
-02:29 02:29
-02:28 02:28

35:33.375 --> 35:35.708
Okay. Hasta-la-vista-Baby's line
follows Stockholm.

35:35.791 --> 35:36.958
The rest come with me.

35:37.041 --> 35:39.083
You heard her. Come on, fast.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.041
Fast!

35:40.125 --> 35:41.125
Fast!

35:41.208 --> 35:42.916
Come on, come on, come on.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.208
To the end of the room.

35:45.125 --> 35:46.750
-Fast.
-Come on, come on.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.250
If I put your mask on myself,

35:52.333 --> 35:54.916
you won't be able to take if off
for the rest of your fucking life.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.083
Put it on, Governor, put it on.

35:59.375 --> 36:00.208
No?

36:00.291 --> 36:02.250
-Free diving, then. Go.
-Release me!

36:06.916 --> 36:08.041
I'm not going in.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.541
He is 60 years old

36:09.625 --> 36:11.875
-and has coronary heart disease.
-Well, man...

36:11.958 --> 36:13.166
better for us.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.458
Exactly, the coronary heart disease,

36:15.541 --> 36:17.458
the bathyscaphe, the 20 atmospheres...

36:17.541 --> 36:21.125
Just thinking about all that will give him
an astonishing lucidity.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.750
This whole plan depends
on the decision of a man.

36:23.833 --> 36:26.708
And I'm pretty sure
he will decide not to do it.

36:26.791 --> 36:30.625
Do you know when he will have
his ultimate moment of lucidity?

36:31.833 --> 36:34.416
Once he gets into that flooded chamber

36:35.333 --> 36:37.083
and realizes he can't escape.

36:38.083 --> 36:41.500
Once he decides his life depends
on us opening that door...

36:41.791 --> 36:44.958
or closing off his oxygen.

36:45.041 --> 36:48.375
Sergio, if you had to choose between
your decency and your oxygen,

36:48.458 --> 36:49.500
what would you pick?

36:52.750 --> 36:53.708
He won't go inside.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.208
He will.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.750
We'll have to push him a little bit...

36:59.458 --> 37:00.291
but he will.

37:00.625 --> 37:01.791
You fucked it up, peanut.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.083
Matías, the bolt cutters.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.416
They cut so fucking well.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.458
Tell me the code or you will count bills

37:11.541 --> 37:13.541
with your fucking stumps.

37:18.208 --> 37:19.416
Fuck, Governor.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.666
What a brave idiot.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.916
-Oh, my God!
-Denver!

37:24.833 --> 37:26.750
Denver, what the fuck did you do?

37:26.833 --> 37:29.291
For God's sake!
Someone tell me what's happening!

37:30.083 --> 37:30.916
Grab this.

37:31.666 --> 37:32.750
Governor.

37:33.208 --> 37:34.166
Governor, Mario.

37:34.250 --> 37:35.083
Mario.

37:35.166 --> 37:37.041
Fuck me! Fuck's sake!

37:37.833 --> 37:38.750
What's up, Nairobi?

37:39.500 --> 37:40.916
He lost consciousness.

37:41.000 --> 37:41.916
For God's sake!

37:42.541 --> 37:45.333
One hundred thirty beats.
He's going to suffer a heart attack.

37:45.416 --> 37:47.666
-How much time do we have left?
-One minute and 20 seconds.

37:47.958 --> 37:48.791
That much?

37:49.833 --> 37:52.833
Matías, the first-aid kit and the staples.
We have to close the wound.

37:52.916 --> 37:53.875
-Quickly!
-Denver!

37:53.958 --> 37:55.375
Cover his wound, fuck!

37:55.708 --> 37:56.541
OK, OK.

37:56.916 --> 37:58.208
Hurry up, Denver!

38:00.916 --> 38:03.500
What if, for any reason,

38:04.541 --> 38:06.125
he decides not to open that door?

38:08.125 --> 38:09.708
There are always risks.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.625
Brother, please.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.291
What would life be without risks?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.166
Brother, that's what makes life exciting.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.458
If something goes wrong,

38:19.583 --> 38:21.625
we will always have the C-4.

38:23.041 --> 38:23.875
Bogotá.

38:25.875 --> 38:26.875
Be careful, brother.

38:30.083 --> 38:31.416
Go, go, go.

38:32.416 --> 38:34.625
Come on, without fear. Fuck! Without fear.

38:38.458 --> 38:39.958
Fast, fast, fast!

38:40.041 --> 38:43.000
Pulse at 150.
This guy is going to explode.

38:43.083 --> 38:44.041
<i>C-4 inside there?</i>

38:44.125 --> 38:45.541
<i>Also called RDX,</i>

38:45.625 --> 38:48.000
or popularly known as plastic explosive.

38:48.083 --> 38:49.083
You're crazy!

38:49.166 --> 38:50.666
Well, it's unpredictable.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.208
Uncouth, even, but exciting.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.333
Even the river is going to tremble.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.625
Gentlemen, we're going in.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.083
We know the priority target,

39:00.166 --> 39:03.666
but we have the green light to fire on
any member of the gang.

39:09.375 --> 39:12.750
The presence of at least
a hundred hostages is confirmed.

39:12.833 --> 39:15.833
...blocked-off streets and the whole
country looking at the Bank of Spain.

39:15.916 --> 39:19.583
A special operations unit
has been deployed

39:19.666 --> 39:23.625
<i>and armored cars and assault vehicles</i>
<i>have been seen driving around.</i>

39:23.708 --> 39:27.291
<i>And for a few minutes ago, helicopters</i>
<i>have been heard overhead as well.</i>

39:34.708 --> 39:36.208
-00:52
-00:51

39:36.291 --> 39:37.666
Ten milligrams of diazepam.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.083
For fuck's sake!

39:40.166 --> 39:41.250
Come on!

39:41.583 --> 39:44.041
Come on. Okay.

39:44.125 --> 39:47.791
<i>A blast wave at 50 meters underwater,</i>

39:47.875 --> 39:52.083
liberating a pressure of 40 atmospheres,
not even God knows what can happen there.

39:54.166 --> 39:57.125
Denver, remind me to beat you up
as soon as this ends.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.750
Fucking idiot!

39:59.291 --> 40:01.583
A small big bang,
but that's how life starts.

40:15.375 --> 40:17.583
No, it isn't going down. Give me another.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.500
Please! Please!

40:25.916 --> 40:27.208
-09
-08

40:27.416 --> 40:28.791
Okay, okay.

40:29.166 --> 40:30.458
-08
-07

40:31.833 --> 40:33.041
-07
-06

40:34.708 --> 40:35.833
-03
-02

40:38.000 --> 40:38.958
-01
-00

40:39.166 --> 40:42.250
It's true that it could damage
part of what's inside the safe,

40:42.333 --> 40:43.791
but it will open it for sure.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.083
God!
