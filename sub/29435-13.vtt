Retired gunnery sergeant.Rules out accident.

How do we know that?McGEE: A gunny
would've known better

04:15.559 --> 04:18.345
than to just walk into an active
weapon range like that.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.955
Suicide, Jimmy?

04:19.998 --> 04:21.304
I don't think so.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.175
Uh, the force of the explosion

04:23.219 --> 04:24.568
clearly dismembered the body.

04:24.612 --> 04:27.354
But the hypoxic nature
of this tissue suggests

04:27.397 --> 04:29.660
that there was no blood flow at
the time of the missile strike.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.009
Which means...

04:31.053 --> 04:33.142
Backer was already dead
when the missile hit.

GIBBS:

I'm-I'm gonna have to get him--

04:42.717 --> 04:46.024
all of him-- back to autopsy.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.984
U-Uh, the post-mortem
lividity here suggests

04:49.027 --> 04:51.813
that the body was also moved
after he died.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.380
Which means...

04:53.423 --> 04:56.208
Someone put him here.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.344
So, I take it by your lack
of uniform, you're a civilian?

05:01.388 --> 05:03.346
That's right.
I-I work for a company

05:03.390 --> 05:05.174
called LanWar Defense Systems.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.524
And that's their drone?LanWar makes
the weapons,

05:07.568 --> 05:09.439
the Marine Warfighting Lab
tests them.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.485
It's pretty small
for a combat drone.

05:11.528 --> 05:14.531
And extremely lightweight.
It's only six pounds,

05:14.575 --> 05:16.838
but its missiles
pack a hell of a punch.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.274
How much punch?Imagine if you could

05:18.318 --> 05:19.623
stuff a Category 5 tornado

05:19.667 --> 05:22.104
into something the size
of a water bottle.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.369
Whoever was down there
didn't stand a chance.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.892
All right, thanks.

05:27.936 --> 05:31.505
So the victim was I.D.'d
as Daniel Backer.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.552
You knew him?

05:35.596 --> 05:37.902
Yeah. He's, um,
a retired gunnery sergeant.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.904
He-he works for us at LanWar.

05:39.948 --> 05:43.865
He helps us plan the demos that
we run for the Warfighting Lab.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.084
So you all knew him?

05:46.128 --> 05:48.391
Including the Marine who
piloted the drone today?

05:48.435 --> 05:50.524
Staff Sergeant
Diana Murphy. Yes.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.526
You said she fired her missile

05:52.569 --> 05:54.832
despite your repeated orders
to stand down.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.531
Well, I-I don't know
what she was thinking.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.098
It's ironic that
it was Backer down there.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.361
Why would you say that?

06:01.404 --> 06:03.145
Well, they used to date.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.668
Yeah, we're gonna
need to talk to her.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.583
Of course.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.020
Look, I-I'm sure
she was just so focused,

06:09.064 --> 06:10.631
she didn't hear the order.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.937
I mean, I know
how that sounds, but...

06:12.981 --> 06:14.722
I left her in the
pilots' ready room.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.376
She was pretty distraught.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.642
She was just...

06:23.121 --> 06:24.775
Where did she go?

06:33.480 --> 06:37.048
Staff Sergeant Diana Murphy,
30 years old,

06:37.092 --> 06:39.442
served in the Marine Corps
for the last nine.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.184
She started out flying drone
missions in Afghanistan

06:42.227 --> 06:44.708
but now specializes in piloting
UAVs for the Warfighting Lab.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.884
Why is she running?

06:46.928 --> 06:48.277
Well, maybe because she killed
her ex-boyfriend,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.670
and blew up the evidence?

06:49.713 --> 06:52.237
BOLO's out.
Quantico MPs have been alerted.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.456
We'll find her.

06:55.937 --> 06:59.462
Competent, capable. Nothing
murdery at all, actually.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.422
Wait, did I mention that
she blew up her ex-boyfriend?

07:03.901 --> 07:07.209
Also known as retired
Gunnery Sergeant Daniel Backer.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.429
37, decorated,
well-liked.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.605
Described as
a "total Boy Scout."

07:11.648 --> 07:15.565
After Backer left the Marines,
uh, LanWar offered him a job.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.176
Which means he spent a lot of
time in the Warfighting Lab.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.135
We think that's
where he met Murphy.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.702
You get a cause of death yet?

07:21.745 --> 07:23.747
Uh, not yet.
No, Jimmy's taking longer

07:23.791 --> 07:25.314
than usual for some reason.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.316
McGee, take Torres to LanWar.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.839
See what else you can
find out about Backer.

07:28.883 --> 07:29.927
On it.
On it.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.758

As your first test, we will
start by reassembling the body.

of this facet,

Would you please turn that off?

08:04.005 --> 08:06.224

08:08.009 --> 08:10.925

a great deal of concentration.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.842
Uh, seriously. How do you do
anything with these gloves on?

08:14.885 --> 08:18.062
They're actually quite handy,
for work.

quadriceps femoris.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.534
Sorry about that, Gunny.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.579
That young lady had
a stellar résumé

08:56.623 --> 08:58.886
and absolutely no
place in the SAZ.

08:58.929 --> 09:02.367
That's the Sacred
Autopsy Zone.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.980
You didn't used to think of me
like that, did you?

09:06.023 --> 09:07.503
Cause of death.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.027
Right. As we suspected,

09:10.071 --> 09:12.029
Backer's C.O.D. was
not a drone strike,

09:12.073 --> 09:13.378
but rather a gunshot wound,

09:13.422 --> 09:15.598
confirming this was,
in fact, a murder.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.382
Entry was right here.
He was shot at point-blank range

09:17.426 --> 09:20.429
with what I can only assume
was a nine-millimeter bullet,

09:20.472 --> 09:22.213
which we cannot find.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.041
Lost in the blast.Yeah.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.303
Any idea where
he was killed?

09:25.347 --> 09:27.610
I couldn't even begin
to tell you. Gibbs,

09:27.654 --> 09:29.960
any piece of evidence that
could've given me a clue was...

09:30.004 --> 09:32.267
Lost in the blast.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.489
Who has a thing with kneecaps?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.102
I'm sorry.
It was a shock to us all.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.451
TORRES:
You and Backer close?

09:42.494 --> 09:44.018
We hadn't worked together long,

09:44.061 --> 09:46.020
but he was one of those guys
you couldn't help but like.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.588
You notice anything
off with him lately?

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
No. His work was
always top-notch.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.201
I mean, who better to show the
military how to use our weapons

09:53.244 --> 09:54.637
than a decorated Marine?

09:54.681 --> 09:57.161
What the hell was he doing
on a live firing range?

09:57.205 --> 09:58.467
He knew better.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.122
Actually, it wasn't your drone
that killed him.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.602
He was shot.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.386
What? How?

10:04.429 --> 10:05.692
McGEE:
That's what we're
here to investigate.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.737
Were you aware
of the relationship he had

10:07.781 --> 10:09.260
with Staff Sergeant Murphy?

10:09.304 --> 10:10.610
Not really.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.179
What I do know is they seemed
more off than on.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.833
What does that have
to do with anything?

10:16.877 --> 10:19.836
Their last breakup,
that seem amicable to you?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.666
Looks like you have
something to say.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.973
A couple of days ago,
Danny and Diana

10:26.016 --> 10:28.018
got into a fight in the lab.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.368
And?And I thought it was
gonna come to blows.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.718
I almost called the MPs.

10:31.761 --> 10:34.416
What was it about?I don't know.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.766
You know where Diana is
right now?[phone rings]

10:36.810 --> 10:38.638
Look, she's a tough lady,
but I've never seen anything

10:38.681 --> 10:40.204
that would make
me think that...

10:42.032 --> 10:45.383
Everybody has off days.
Everybody has fights, right?

10:45.427 --> 10:46.428
Mm.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.690
That doesn't make her a killer.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.692
Right, totally,
so back to my question.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.694
Do you know where she is now?

10:51.738 --> 10:52.826
I do.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.438
MPs found her.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.831
Where?

10:57.874 --> 10:58.832
SLOANE:
So, she ran back

10:58.875 --> 11:00.007
to her ex-boyfriend's place

11:00.050 --> 11:01.791
after she blew up his body?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.184
I'm sure you got some kind

11:03.227 --> 11:04.664
of psychological theory.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.100
If she's our killer,
maybe that's

11:06.143 --> 11:07.884
where Backer was
originally murdered.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.104
Some killers like to return
to the scene of the crime

11:10.147 --> 11:11.714
to revel in what they've done.

11:11.758 --> 11:15.196
Not much revelry going on
in there.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.161
One of your agents said it was

11:24.205 --> 11:26.598
Danny out there in that
weapons field-- is that true?

11:26.642 --> 11:28.122
Is he dead?

11:28.165 --> 11:30.646
It's true.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.430
But maybe you already knew that.

11:32.474 --> 11:35.999
Staff Sergeant
Murphy,

11:36.043 --> 11:37.784
why did you leave
the crime scene?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.573
W-What?

11:44.616 --> 11:45.617
Why'd you run?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.358
I wasn't thinking straight.

11:47.402 --> 11:48.751
I'd just killed someone
with a missile.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.232
No, you didn't.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.933
Danny was already dead by
the time your missile hit him.

11:58.805 --> 11:59.762
He was shot.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.633
But I'm thinking
you already

12:01.677 --> 12:02.809
knew that, too,
didn't you?

12:04.593 --> 12:06.813
Diana?

12:07.814 --> 12:09.859
What, what is it?

12:09.903 --> 12:11.731
BISHOP:
You didn't answer my question.

12:11.774 --> 12:12.819
Diana?

12:14.472 --> 12:15.909
Hey!

12:15.952 --> 12:17.432
Why did you run back to
Backer's apartment

12:17.475 --> 12:18.825
after the missile strike?

12:18.868 --> 12:20.261
For help-- he's the only

12:20.304 --> 12:22.306
person that I trust.Or...

12:22.350 --> 12:24.482
you and he got into a bad fight.

12:24.526 --> 12:25.701
You shot him.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.094
And you tried
to cover it up

12:27.137 --> 12:28.878
by dumping his body

12:28.922 --> 12:32.577
in a weapons range that you knew
was scheduled to be hit.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.275
When his body
was discovered,

12:34.318 --> 12:36.233
you raced back to
his apartment to

12:36.277 --> 12:38.845
cover any evidence
that was left behind.No.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.543
You know, there is something
off about her responses,

12:41.586 --> 12:43.763
but I can't quite
put my finger on it.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.286
BISHOP: Ingram ordered you
to stand down,

12:45.329 --> 12:46.766
so why did you fire
that missile?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.768
I didn't know anyone
was out there.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.074
You were ordered to hold
your fire three times.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.512
Why'd you disobey the order?

12:54.556 --> 12:55.687
W-What?

12:55.731 --> 12:57.820
Why did you disobey the order?

12:57.864 --> 12:58.865
I didn't kill Danny.

12:58.908 --> 12:59.953
I loved him.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.084
Semper fi, Marine!

13:03.826 --> 13:04.958
[door opens]

13:07.351 --> 13:08.613
What'd I miss?

13:08.657 --> 13:10.790
Uh, just-just Gibbs
being Gibbs.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.837
Semper fi.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.231
Ooh-rah!

13:20.321 --> 13:22.236
She can't hear. She's deaf!

13:22.279 --> 13:25.065
Wait, can you still be
a Marine if you're deaf?

13:25.108 --> 13:27.241
No. No, you can't.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.861
All right, that concludes
the hearing test.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.168
You can, uh, take off
the headphones now.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.996
Ian?

13:43.039 --> 13:44.606
Would you get me
the test results, please?

13:44.649 --> 13:46.260
Hey, I was told this job

13:46.303 --> 13:48.044
was for an
assistant M.E.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.481
As in... dead bodies.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.179
My apologies for being alive.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.311
Yes, Ian, once in
a while, we are

13:54.355 --> 13:56.661
called upon to help
in other medical areas.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.098
So, would you, please?

13:59.882 --> 14:01.841
This is a waste of time.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.538
Danny's killer
is out there still.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.887
Or in here.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.281
Wait... "killer"?

14:07.324 --> 14:09.892
Does that mean you have
some dead bodies? Where?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.981
How bad is it?JIMMY:
Still waiting

14:12.025 --> 14:13.896
on the test results.
Ian, would you...?

14:13.940 --> 14:14.897
Yeah, I'm sorry.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.290
I never made a good gopher.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.595
Like I said before,

14:17.639 --> 14:19.815
cutting up dead bodies is...

14:19.859 --> 14:22.209
more my jam.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.037
You know,
the sound of a bone saw

14:24.080 --> 14:25.473
early in the morning,
first thing

14:25.516 --> 14:27.910
in a nice sterile
room like this...Okay. Yeah.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.608
I think I have all
the information I need.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.741
Uh, you go have a good day.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.090
I won't be in touch.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.921
I am so sorry about that.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.749
How bad is it?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.011
JIMMY:
According to this test,

14:42.055 --> 14:44.971
you have lost almost
100% of your hearing.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.450
In both ears.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.061
TORRES:
But you already knew that.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.890
I read that it
can get better.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.674
Unfortunately, not with
this type of hearing loss.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.896
Though I see you've gotten
quite good at reading lips.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.462
She had to.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.247
If she was gonna hide it
from her superiors.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.379
Or her ex-boyfriend--
you know, the one she blew up.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.558
Maybe he found out.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.213
He was gonna rat her
out to her C.O. and...

15:10.257 --> 15:11.345
she had to take him out.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.955
Or maybe he's the one that

15:12.999 --> 15:14.783
caused her hearing loss
in the first place.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.698
Making his murder
an act of revenge.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.570
I can read your lips
in the reflection.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.094
Okay, fine.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.226
Y-Your file here
says that you and Backer

15:23.270 --> 15:25.098
were involved
in some sort of accident

15:25.141 --> 15:27.100
a few months ago?Does it?

15:27.143 --> 15:30.494
Some kind of a weapons test
that went sideways.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.583
I don't want to talk about it.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.063
Look...

15:34.107 --> 15:35.935
I get it, I do.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.067
But the file, it's quite vague.

15:38.111 --> 15:41.723
If you really are
innocent, just...

15:41.766 --> 15:44.030
And she's completely
ignoring me on purpose now.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.948
TORRES:
Diana?

15:48.991 --> 15:51.951
Did the accident cause you
to lose your hearing?

15:54.866 --> 15:57.521
The accident involved a
top secret weapons test,

15:57.565 --> 16:00.089
so the after-action report
had been heavily redacted.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.265
But we could read enough to know
that Backer was involved.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.963
Involved how?

16:04.006 --> 16:06.966
Looks like he was demoing
some kind of new weapon.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.968
McGEE:
Diana didn't report
any serious injuries,

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
but according to Jimmy,
the timing works out.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.275
BISHOP:
Which, yes, makes Backer

16:12.319 --> 16:14.147
look responsible
for her hearing loss.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.018
And ending her military career.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.020
Hell of a motive.
BISHOP:
Problem is...

16:18.064 --> 16:19.021
no opportunity.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.109
We spoke to Diana's

16:20.153 --> 16:21.371
co-workers at the lab.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.938
BISHOP:
They said that she was at work

16:22.982 --> 16:25.114
till 1:00 in the morning
the night Danny was killed.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.725
And according to our latest
time of death, that gives her

16:27.769 --> 16:29.031
an airtight alibi.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.902
Which makes her not our killer.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.034
Does not make her innocent.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.383
She's still hiding something.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.428
Find out what.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.125
Oh.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.607
Why am I here?

16:39.650 --> 16:41.087
You know I didn't kill Danny.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.871
Why aren't you out there
looking for the person who did?

16:42.914 --> 16:44.090
Oh, we are.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.744
Don't you worry
about that, okay?

16:46.788 --> 16:48.746
But I want to hear more
about your accident.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.009
Why?

16:55.101 --> 16:57.103
Danny wanted to show me
a new weapon

16:57.146 --> 16:58.974
he was about to demo
for the lab.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.497
What-what was it exactly?

17:00.541 --> 17:03.022
A long-range rifle that uses
sound instead of bullets.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.197
It disables the enemy

17:04.240 --> 17:05.937
by heating up the cells
in their body.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.548
Wow.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.854
Never had anything like that
when I was in the Army.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.160
Danny said it'd be
a game changer.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.770
He said that we could
use it to fight wars

17:12.814 --> 17:14.163
without killing anyone.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.122
During the demo,
Danny activated the weapon

17:16.165 --> 17:18.254
before I had
my protective earmuffs on.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.302
Right away, I knew it was bad.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.521
That must have been terrifying.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.611
He wanted to take me
to the infirmary, but...

17:27.655 --> 17:29.744
I was afraid of anyone
finding out.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.225
I can't imagine the stress
that put on the both of you.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.053
At first, Danny helped me
hide it at work.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.185
He helped me to learn
how to read lips.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.623
I got good fast.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.973
But when the ringing
turned to silence,

17:42.017 --> 17:43.801
he wanted me to tell my C.O.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.455
And we both knew
what that meant.

17:45.499 --> 17:46.978
You'd be out of the Corps.

17:49.198 --> 17:53.072
You're required to report
that hearing test, aren't you?

17:53.115 --> 17:55.248
Yes. Yes, I am.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.120
Being a Marine is the only thing
that I've ever wanted.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.992
My father...

18:01.036 --> 18:02.559
He was a Marine, too?

18:02.603 --> 18:03.995
Yeah.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.172
He was so proud of it.

18:08.130 --> 18:11.438
Do you know what it meant
for him to see his only child--

18:11.481 --> 18:13.266
a daughter--
become one?

18:13.309 --> 18:16.138
I don't know how
to be anything else.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.487
You-you do.

18:17.531 --> 18:20.142
You know how to be a friend

18:20.186 --> 18:22.188
to Danny.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.147
I need you to think.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.150
Is there anyone who might've
had a grudge against him?

18:28.194 --> 18:29.282
No.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.284
Everyone loved him.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.155
His friends, his co-workers.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.461
Family?

18:34.504 --> 18:36.419
Actually, there is someone.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.335
He had a stepbrother.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.163
I don't think they got along.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.644
You got a name?

18:45.602 --> 18:47.604
[rock music playing]

18:49.389 --> 18:51.478
So, which one
of these guys looks

18:51.521 --> 18:53.567
like a wicked
stepbrother to you?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.395
She said the dude's
name was Ron, right?

18:55.438 --> 18:58.006
Yeah, Ronald Kepczak.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.705
TORRES:
Then that dude?

19:01.749 --> 19:03.751
Yeah, let's find out.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.623
Well, there he is.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.366
Ronald Kepczak?

19:10.410 --> 19:11.933
Who's asking?

19:11.976 --> 19:14.370
Special Agents Torres and McGee.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.851
Are you related
to Daniel Backer?
[scoffs]

19:16.894 --> 19:19.375
Only 'cause my mom married
that son of a bitch's dad.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.377
So, I'm guessing
you are notclose?

19:21.421 --> 19:24.728
No, he had already enlisted by
the time my mom and I moved in.

19:24.772 --> 19:25.947
And?

19:25.990 --> 19:27.340
And what?

19:27.383 --> 19:29.080
What makes him a son of a bitch?

19:29.124 --> 19:30.865
Well, when my
stepdad died,

19:30.908 --> 19:32.301
he left the freakin' house
to Danny.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.607
That house should've been mine.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.348
Danny barely even
freakin' lived in it.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.263
That's a,
that's a tough break.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.308
Yeah, I mean, he was cool enough
about everything at first.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.136
He used to let me record there.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.225
Spent a ton of money building
a soundproof recording studio

19:43.269 --> 19:45.445
in a back room, and then
one day out of the blue,

19:45.488 --> 19:47.316
[mockingly]:
he just changes his mind.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.404
He tell you why?

19:48.448 --> 19:50.276
[scoffs] No, some BS reason.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.365
It was obvious he
was lying, though.

19:53.583 --> 19:57.326
My guess is he was
up to something.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.241
Something he didn't want
anyone else to know about.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.982
He even changed the locks on me.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.419
Doesn't really sound like the
guy we've been hearing about.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.552
Exactly! See, everybody thinks
that he's this goody little

20:05.595 --> 20:08.381
two-shoes, but what kind
of a royal jackass does that?

20:08.424 --> 20:11.253
With him out of the way,
you can finally have the house.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.386
"Out of the way"--
what, did he finally move?

20:13.429 --> 20:14.561
He was killed last night.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.042
Danny's dead?

20:19.130 --> 20:21.481
Ha! [laughing]

20:21.524 --> 20:23.265
Boy, did he have
that coming, huh?

20:23.309 --> 20:25.876
Ah, looks like little old
Ronnie's luck's about to

20:25.920 --> 20:27.487
[singsongy]:
change!

20:29.445 --> 20:30.707
Oh, come on.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.274
You don't think
that I did it, do you?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.580
I don't know, did you?

20:33.623 --> 20:35.277
Come on, man, you said
it happened last night?

20:35.321 --> 20:37.366
There was, like, a hundred
people here watching me play.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.195
A hundred, huh?

20:42.415 --> 20:43.677
Everybody's a critic.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.809
We're gonna need
the address to that house.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.116
You guys stay for the show,
you got it.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.335
No.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.379
GEARY:
Believe me,
sir, I know

20:50.423 --> 20:51.685
how cold all
this sounds.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.339
I actually turned around
in the parking lot twice

20:53.382 --> 20:54.601
before I came up here.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.951
And yet, somehow
you still made it.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.387
Because Backer's death
was associated

20:58.431 --> 20:59.997
with one of LanWar's drones...

21:00.041 --> 21:01.869
VANCE:
There's been an automatic
freeze on all contracts

21:01.912 --> 21:04.001
pending the outcome
of our investigation.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.961
And you're losing
a ton of money.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.658
Please, don't make me
an ass here.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.486
Danny was a friend.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.748
But your bottom line
kept you from driving

21:11.792 --> 21:13.489
out of the parking lot twice.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.318
This is about more than
just lost revenue, Director.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.059
There are men and women in
uniform all over the world

21:18.102 --> 21:19.278
that need our weapons, sir.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.976
I'll speak to SECNAV.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.370
You need to inform her
that any more delays

21:24.413 --> 21:25.806
are gonna negatively impact
our ability to deliver...

21:25.849 --> 21:27.329
Thank you.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.896
He wastouring around
the parking lot

21:28.939 --> 21:29.940
looking for a place to park.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.510
I was getting coffee.And since you didn't
get one for me,

21:34.554 --> 21:37.165
I'm gonna assume that
this isn't a social call.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.123
Leon, can we hold off
informing the Corps

21:39.167 --> 21:40.951
about Murphy's hearing loss?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.562
It's too late, Gibbs.
She's already been pulled

21:42.605 --> 21:43.911
from active duty.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.956
What's the matter?
I thought you said

21:46.000 --> 21:47.610
she alibied out.She did.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.525
And she lied to us
and she fled the scene.

21:49.569 --> 21:52.093
Now she's come up with
a lead for us to chase?

21:52.136 --> 21:54.356
So you think she's still
hiding something.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.706
I think we can't
afford her disappearing.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.229
Well, your gut is quite
the force, Gibbs,

21:58.273 --> 22:00.101
but you know that's
not enough to hold her.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.537
We got to cut
her loose

22:01.581 --> 22:03.496
and hope that your new lead
pans out.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.541
BISHOP:
Backer's whole life

22:05.585 --> 22:09.806
boiled down to one laptop
and a busted up cell phone,

22:09.850 --> 22:11.373
courtesy of a drone strike.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.375
What's the next level up
from busted?

22:13.419 --> 22:16.247
'Cause this looks like what
I want to do when spammers call.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.727
But you can still get
something off of that, right?

22:17.771 --> 22:20.251
What kind of magic
do you think I do down here?

22:20.295 --> 22:22.602
I know. Okay. Sorry.

22:22.645 --> 22:23.864
I didn't say it was impossible,

22:23.907 --> 22:26.214
just, you know,
first things first.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.433
You found something
on the laptop?

22:27.476 --> 22:29.043
Uh, actually, no.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.524
Your boy Backer had
zero social media presence

22:31.567 --> 22:33.830
and the last thing on his laptop

22:33.874 --> 22:36.920
was an article about
a cat that raised puppies.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.140
Hmm. Well, I can't say
I'm surprised.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.750
There wasn't much
in his apartment, either,

22:40.794 --> 22:41.882
so we got nothing.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.884
Actually, we have one thing.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.845
I just don't know what it is.What is it?

22:48.889 --> 22:51.326
You know, sometimes I feel like
I'm talking to myself down here.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.980
I mean, where did you get it?

22:53.023 --> 22:55.112
Jimmy sent it up. I think
he found it among the remains.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.897
He wants me
to tell himwhat it is.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.986
All I can tell you
is that it appears to be made

22:59.029 --> 23:01.989
out of a metal alloy
I've never seen before.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.425
I asked the director
to put me in touch

23:03.469 --> 23:04.905
with someone from LanWar.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.167
Maybe they know what it is.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.995
Bad news, Miss Hines.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.518
No, don't say that.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.825
I made some calls,
and I didn't get any answers.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.653
They stonewalled you, too?

23:13.696 --> 23:14.784
Don't they know
you're the director

23:14.828 --> 23:15.829
of a federal agency?

23:15.872 --> 23:17.134
Welcome to my world.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.136
But you rest assured,
I'll keep pushing.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.357
Oh, how is Mr. Palmer's
assistant search going?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.925
Uh, he's had some duds.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.448
BISHOP:
Yeah, last I heard,

23:26.492 --> 23:27.841
he was ready to give it up.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.843
Speaking of which,

23:29.886 --> 23:32.019
any chance Ican
get an assistant?

23:32.062 --> 23:34.891
Miss Hines, you're doing
such a great job,

23:34.935 --> 23:36.937
doesn't seem like you need
any help at all to me.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.460
You keep up the good work.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.549
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

23:40.593 --> 23:41.768
That was a smooth no.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.030
Mm-hmm.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.684
[knocking]

23:44.727 --> 23:45.946
TORRES: Why are you knocking?
Let's kick in the door, baby.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.295
McGEE:
We don't have a warrant.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.255
NCIS!

23:51.299 --> 23:54.084
[clattering]

23:54.128 --> 23:56.043
Ready?Yeah.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.880
[engine starting]

24:06.923 --> 24:08.359
Torres.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.927
[tires screeching]

24:10.971 --> 24:12.973
Whoever it is, they're gone.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.062
It's got to be the killer.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.498
We must have
interrupted 'em.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.934
What do you think
they're looking for?

24:17.978 --> 24:19.893
I don't know. Let's check
the rest of the house.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.069
Yeah.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.435
What do you think is in there?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.393
Keypad's got four slots.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.047
Ten numeric options,
I'd say 10,000...

24:44.091 --> 24:45.179
I hate math.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.443
Yeah, but you love
kicking down doors.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.229
Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.712
Ronnie's music studio?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.148
McGEE:
Well, maybe Backer
took over the place

24:58.192 --> 25:00.586
just to start his own band.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.243
Yeah, I don't think so.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.028
McGEE:
It looks like our retired Marine

25:08.071 --> 25:10.378
was doing more in here
than just jamming.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.607
BISHOP:
So this is the same
type of weapon

25:21.650 --> 25:23.130
that caused Diana's
hearing loss?

25:23.173 --> 25:25.088
Designed and built by LanWar.

25:25.132 --> 25:28.135
What was Backer doing
with them in his house?

25:28.178 --> 25:30.441
Funny you should ask.

25:30.485 --> 25:34.097
I just had a good old time
at LanWar trying to get answers.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.229
Well, what do you got?

25:35.272 --> 25:37.448
The weapons at Backer's place?
Stolen.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.754
Did LanWar report them missing?

25:38.798 --> 25:40.103
Well, they didn't know
they were missing.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.365
Apparently, Backer

25:41.409 --> 25:42.758
fudged some type of,

25:42.802 --> 25:44.543
uh, inventory report
or something.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.935
You get a copy?Nope.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.502
They wouldn't give anything up
without a warrant.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.722
Again, what was Backer doing

25:49.765 --> 25:52.246
with stolen weapons
at his house?

25:52.289 --> 25:53.900
Well, either he was
planning the mother

25:53.943 --> 25:55.641
of all laser tag parties...

25:55.684 --> 25:57.207
Or he was planning
on selling them.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.121
McGEE:
I'm going
with the latter.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.296
Prototype weapons like that

25:59.340 --> 26:01.124
usually are worth a fortune.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.343
TORRES:
Looks like the Boy Scout

26:02.386 --> 26:04.084
wasn't very good about
being a Boy Scout.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.390
You think he had
a buyer already?McGEE: Oh, if he did,

26:06.434 --> 26:08.175
that buyer could be our killer.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.873
And deals like this have
a way of going sideways.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.615
JIMMY:
So I reassembled Mr. Backer

26:13.659 --> 26:16.400
to the best of my abilities.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.880
You missed a few pieces.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.229
Yeah, I noticed.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.014
Which is why I went
back to the test field

26:21.057 --> 26:22.493
for a secondary search.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.843
Actually reminded me of
one of the first things

26:23.886 --> 26:25.496
they teach you in
M.E. field training:

26:25.540 --> 26:27.281
Always...
MAN:
"Always go back

26:27.324 --> 26:29.979
for pieces of flesh
you might've missed."

26:30.023 --> 26:32.112
I beg your pardon.
Please excuse the intrusion.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.853
I'm looking for
a Dr. Palmer?

26:33.896 --> 26:35.506
That's me.Christopher Crane,

26:35.550 --> 26:37.770
applicant for
the assistant M.E. position.

26:37.813 --> 26:40.163
Right, right. I'm just finishing
up a briefing now, so...

26:40.207 --> 26:41.469
Say no more.

26:41.512 --> 26:44.298
What a fascinating
constitution of remains.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.604
Yeah.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.301
Isn't it, though?

26:47.344 --> 26:49.651
Shall I properly attire myself
so I can assist?

26:49.695 --> 26:50.696
I'll try not
to be a bother.

26:50.739 --> 26:52.088
By all means.

26:52.132 --> 26:53.742
Yeah, yeah. R-Right
through there.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.703
Well, isn't he enthusiastic?

26:57.746 --> 26:59.008
Flesh you missed.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.054
That's actually a section
of Backer's torso.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.056
And lo and behold,

27:03.099 --> 27:07.277
I found the bullet that killed
him, lodged in his vertebra.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.758
The hell kind of bullet is that?I don't know.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.194
Kasie couldn't even
identify it.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.196
Boss, I got something
you got to see.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.025
Warrant came back for that
LanWar inventory report.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.548
Would you like me
to take over categorizing

27:17.592 --> 27:20.203
the recovered specimens,
Dr. Palmer?

27:20.247 --> 27:21.422
Well, yes, please.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.553
Do you prefer them ordered

27:22.597 --> 27:25.165
by musculoskeletal
or organ system?

27:25.208 --> 27:27.123
Why, thank you for asking.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.169
Uh, just plain old alphabetical
is what we use around here.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.387
You just start
at the top

27:30.431 --> 27:31.954
and work your way down.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.567
Boss, what is happening?
Does Ducky have

27:36.611 --> 27:38.221
another younger brother
we don't know...

27:38.265 --> 27:39.919
McGee. The inventory report.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.269
We had originally assumed
that Backer

27:42.312 --> 27:43.749
was the one
who fudged the report

27:43.792 --> 27:45.446
that allowed him
to steal those weapons.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.448
We were wrong.Who?

27:47.491 --> 27:48.971
You're not gonna like it.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.510
♪

28:19.306 --> 28:22.657
[helicopter blades whirring
outside]

28:22.701 --> 28:24.267
You going somewhere?

28:24.311 --> 28:25.268
It's official.

28:25.312 --> 28:26.879
I've been medically discharged.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.358
You recognize this?

28:28.402 --> 28:30.447
It's an inventory report

28:30.491 --> 28:32.275
from LanWar's
weapons storage unit.

28:32.319 --> 28:35.365
Which you falsified to help
Backer steal from LanWar.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.411
That is your signature,
isn't it?

28:40.327 --> 28:42.329
No. It's not.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.160
Damn it.
Danny must have forged it.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.336
I-I didn't think
he would go that far.

28:49.379 --> 28:52.556
Well, he went a lot further than
that. He committed a felony.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.384
What was he doing
with the weapons?

28:56.822 --> 28:58.824
Start talking.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.784
Talk or we will handcuff you.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.091
For what? I didn't help him.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.746
That's what we fought about
that day at LanWar.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.617
He wanted me to lie on the forms

29:09.660 --> 29:10.792
and wouldn't
tell me why.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.272
I refused.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.795
You told him
you couldn't help him

29:13.839 --> 29:15.231
and he signed your name anyway?

29:15.275 --> 29:16.798
Agent Gibbs,

29:16.842 --> 29:19.322
he stuck his neck out
for me for three months.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.455
He is a good man.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.239
He must have had
his reasons.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.894
Good reasons.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.246
Except...?

29:33.249 --> 29:35.208
The night that we fought,

29:35.251 --> 29:38.211
he told me that he was
leaving to go meet someone.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.343
Who?I don't know.

29:40.387 --> 29:41.562
Where?I don't know.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.911
Danny said the less I knew,
the better.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.260
He said it was
for my own safety.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.001
You didn't think about
telling us this before?

29:46.045 --> 29:47.829
I didn't know what to think.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.919
The Danny that I knew served
with valor and honor.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.226
More than anyone
I have ever met.

29:53.269 --> 29:56.098
I will not jump to conclusions
that might sully his memory.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.144
That's your job.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.061
[door opens]

30:02.104 --> 30:03.758
KASIE:
Oh, hey.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.630
You got tired of asking people,
"So tell me about yourself"?

30:06.674 --> 30:10.156
I was tired, yes,
but now I have one candidate

30:10.199 --> 30:12.506
who has advanced to the
highly selective third round.

30:12.549 --> 30:15.857
He's, uh, organizing
my microscope slides right now.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.251
What are you guys up to here?

30:18.294 --> 30:21.689
Well, Diana said that Backer
met up with a mystery person

30:21.732 --> 30:23.299
right after they had a fight.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.171
Pulled GPS from his phone,

30:25.214 --> 30:28.696
which led us to this
convenience store off I-95.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.264
Seven hours of footage,
still no Backer.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.483
Man, if I had a nickel
for every shady deal

30:33.527 --> 30:35.311
that went down outside
a convenience store...

30:35.355 --> 30:37.270
[scoffs] Mama
would be...

30:37.313 --> 30:39.707
Actually, I-I don't know
what Mama would be doing.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.883
Is it really true
that the hearing-impaired

30:41.927 --> 30:43.711
cannot serve in the military?

30:43.754 --> 30:47.497
Yeah. The DoD has a standard
that you have to be able

30:47.541 --> 30:49.543
to hear without the use
of any aid.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.285
Yeah, but that's crazy.
I mean, look at Diana.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.504
Are you telling me
there isn't some kind of, like,

30:54.548 --> 30:56.071
non-combat role

30:56.115 --> 30:58.073
that she could,
like, kick ass in?

30:58.117 --> 31:00.162
Okay. Is this the Angry Kasie

31:00.206 --> 31:01.903
you warned me about
that one time?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.426
Waste makes me angry.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.341
And stupid waste
makes me stupid angry.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.300
Other countries allow the
hearing-impaired to serve.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.954
I looked it up.

31:08.997 --> 31:12.348
Uh, well,
this might make you happy.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.916
Look.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.396
I think
that's Backer.

31:16.439 --> 31:18.137
There's the guest of honor.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.792
That's one
of the sonic weapon cases.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.925
BISHOP: We need to
I.D. the person

31:23.969 --> 31:25.971
in the other car.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.929
KASIE:
Uh, yup, but
for facial recognition,

31:27.973 --> 31:30.192
kind of need to see his face,
but maybe...

31:37.243 --> 31:38.853
Bingo. Got the plate.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.902
"Zahir Najjar."

31:43.945 --> 31:47.427
One Zahir Najjar
coming right up.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.908
Hmm. Looks like
he's a professor

31:49.951 --> 31:51.953
of electrical engineering
at M.I.T.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.129
See? This is what happens when
you don't pay teachers enough.

31:55.696 --> 31:56.915
They become arms dealers.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.527
NAJJAR:
An arms dealer, huh?

32:00.570 --> 32:02.616
That's an interesting theory.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.141
This looks like
more than a theory.

32:07.795 --> 32:08.927
You recognize it?

32:10.537 --> 32:12.191
NAJJAR:
It's a sonic weapon.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.670
A prototype.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.194
What was it doing in
your living room?

32:15.237 --> 32:16.978
We know you got it
from Daniel Backer.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.371
BISHOP:
Or was it bought?

32:18.414 --> 32:19.589
What's the deal?

32:19.633 --> 32:21.504
He steals the weapons,
sells them to you?

32:21.548 --> 32:23.463
And going by
that cheap suit,

32:23.506 --> 32:26.074
I'm guessing you're
just a middleman.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.511
And going by this,

32:28.555 --> 32:30.992
it looks like you two
had a falling out.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.264
You didn't check your work,
Agents.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.266
You wouldn't do well
in my class.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.139
I didn't know Daniel was dead

32:47.182 --> 32:49.141
until you broke down my door.

32:49.184 --> 32:52.579
He and I did have a deal,
that part is true.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.929
But not the one you think.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.539
The man was a patriot.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.889
He loved the military
more than life itself.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.109
Then why the hell
steal from it?

33:01.153 --> 33:02.981
Simple.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.852
He was trying to protect it.

33:13.730 --> 33:14.688
Update.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.255
Come on, let's go.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.779
Professor Najjar had a pretty
interesting story to tell.

33:18.822 --> 33:21.173
Even if he told it in the
most demeaning way possible.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.044
Torres is still in with him.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.263
BISHOP:
He said Backer just

33:24.306 --> 33:25.829
couldn't get over the
accident with Diana.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.179
She lost her hearing.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.223
McGEE:
Yeah, and he's the one
that made it happen

33:28.267 --> 33:30.051
when he misfired
his weapon.

33:30.095 --> 33:33.141
BISHOP:
Except Backer started to think
that maybe it wasn't a misfire.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.013
And with more training,
he found a design flaw

33:35.056 --> 33:37.276
in the weapon itself, and that
is what caused the accident.

33:37.319 --> 33:38.451
He tell anyone?

33:38.494 --> 33:39.713
Well, apparently,
he tried to,

33:39.756 --> 33:41.802
but no one would listen.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.065
The professor gave us
these. They're copies

33:44.109 --> 33:46.894
of Backer's
internal LanWar reports.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.939
BISHOP:
Yeah, but they never saw
the light of day.

33:48.983 --> 33:51.986
Backer didn't steal the weapons
to sell them.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.293
He was trying
to blow the whistle.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.425
He knew his official reports
were getting buried,

33:56.469 --> 33:58.471
so he went outside
the chain of command.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.081
Backer called up
an old professor

34:00.125 --> 34:01.648
to conduct the tests.

34:01.691 --> 34:04.738
But they needed the weapons
to test them.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.219
Well, if he was wrong, he was
risking his entire career.

34:07.262 --> 34:09.308
Not to mention jail time.

34:09.351 --> 34:12.093
But Backer took the risk anyway.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.183
It was the right thing to do.
Who buried his reports?

34:18.099 --> 34:20.058
Gentlemen, I'm confused.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.624
I was called in
to discuss SECNAV

34:21.668 --> 34:23.148
lifting the freeze
on LanWar's contracts.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.845
Yeah, we made that up.

34:24.888 --> 34:27.152
But we thought you should know

34:27.195 --> 34:31.112
that Staff Sergeant Murphy
was cleared of Backer's murder.

34:31.156 --> 34:34.202
She had an alibi at the lab
for the night in question.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.769
What?

34:35.812 --> 34:37.771
So now you're back
to square one?

34:37.814 --> 34:39.599
Every day this investigation
remains open,

34:39.642 --> 34:40.948
we're losing money.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.123
Yeah, no worries.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
We got a new suspect.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.171
Go ahead, have a seat.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.174
Gentlemen,

34:49.217 --> 34:51.132
I don't know where you're going
with this, but...

34:52.177 --> 34:54.004
What is that?

34:54.048 --> 34:56.137
Gee, Agent Torres,
does that look like

34:56.181 --> 34:58.835
an internal LanWar
safety report to you?

34:58.879 --> 35:01.664
Oh, yeah.
It sure does, Agent McGee.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.752
It talks about

35:02.796 --> 35:04.145
a design flaw

35:04.189 --> 35:05.886
in one of LanWar's weapons.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.148
What about this one here?

35:07.192 --> 35:08.976
Hmm, that looks like
the memo that was

35:09.019 --> 35:10.195
sent in its place.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.153
You want to know what it says?

35:12.197 --> 35:13.676
[chuckles]
It has your signature on it.

35:16.549 --> 35:17.941
It's an authorization

35:17.985 --> 35:19.987
to release those weapons
for troops testing.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.684
Weapons you knew were faulty.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.121
And yet you gave them
the green light.

35:23.164 --> 35:25.210
See, those of us in the
"bad guy busting" business

35:25.253 --> 35:26.689
call that a whitewash.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.257
And when Backer found out
and wanted to stop you...

35:29.301 --> 35:30.476
You killed him.

35:30.519 --> 35:32.086
You dumped his body
in a weapons range.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.219
Figured that the evidence
would be blown up.No, no.

35:34.262 --> 35:35.437
You got it all wrong.

35:35.481 --> 35:38.266
Really? Because it
feels so right to me.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.268
What about you,
Agent Torres?So, so right.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.184
Okay, look, okay, it's true.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.925
I buried Backer's report.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.188
I authorized the release
of those weapons.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.017
Come on, just let it out.
You'll feel so much better.

35:50.060 --> 35:53.020
I couldn't risk losing
my military contracts. Not now.

35:54.630 --> 35:57.981
I'm in the process of selling
my majority stake in LanWar.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.201
I went through a bad divorce
and I needed the money.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.768
But I didn't kill anybody.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.509
And yet it's all feeling...

36:03.552 --> 36:04.901
What was that again, McGee?

36:04.945 --> 36:06.512
So, so right.So, so right.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.557
You said Staff Sergeant Murphy
couldn't be the killer

36:08.601 --> 36:10.690
because she was at the lab
the night of the murder.

36:10.733 --> 36:13.127
Your point?I was there
that night, too.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.477
Overseeing LanWar's operations.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.221
So I guess you are back
to square one.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.788
Maybe not.

36:21.831 --> 36:25.226
Mr. Geary, who are you selling
your stake in LanWar to?

36:25.270 --> 36:27.924
George Ingram.Who is he?

36:27.968 --> 36:31.276
He is the chief
weapons developer at LanWar.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.321
Yeah, we met already.

36:33.365 --> 36:34.931
He was supervising
the training exercise

36:34.975 --> 36:37.369
the day Diana
torpedoed her boyfriend.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.893
Is it me,
or does chief developer

36:39.936 --> 36:42.243
seem a little below
his pay grade?

36:42.287 --> 36:45.333
Not just you.
I spoke with HR at LanWar.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.292
Turns out that Ingram
doesn't normally run

36:47.335 --> 36:49.250
the training exercises,
but he put himself

36:49.294 --> 36:50.295
on the roster that day.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.340
Even dictated the target.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.950
Well, that is not convenient.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.909
Well, neither is buying

36:55.952 --> 36:57.258

36:57.302 --> 36:58.390
Where is he now?Pinging his phone

36:58.433 --> 37:00.218
as we speak.Yeah? And?

37:02.307 --> 37:05.397
Ooh. Uh, we might have
a problem here.

Ingram's at Diana's.

Oh...
Mm.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.986
Yeah. No, I don't see it.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.380
CRANE:
Rest well, young warrior.

38:59.424 --> 39:02.383
We shall never know what heights
you may have climbed

39:02.427 --> 39:04.733
or oceans you may have crossed.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.692
Alas,

39:06.735 --> 39:08.824
what could have been.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.089
Okay, now I see it. Yeah.Mm.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.224
Congratulations, Mr. Crane.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.269
You have done an excellent job.

39:19.313 --> 39:22.577
I would like to officially
offer you the position.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.318
Oh, dear.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.407
Uh, actually, I was

39:26.451 --> 39:28.801
just about to say
my goodbyes.What's that?

39:28.844 --> 39:31.891
Summer of 2015.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.328
I was on a gondola
in Venice when

39:34.372 --> 39:36.591
the boat tipped over,
and I suddenly realized

39:36.635 --> 39:41.335
that I could swim better
than I ever imagined.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.597
You see,

39:42.641 --> 39:45.383
one has to fully appreciate
his own abilities

39:45.426 --> 39:46.862
before he can truly know

39:46.906 --> 39:50.126
what type of help to seek.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.433
Mm.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.392
Cheerio.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.444
I have no idea
what that even means.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.490
I think it means
back to the drawing board.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.144
[sighs]

40:19.025 --> 40:20.461
[door opens]

40:21.506 --> 40:23.769
Thanks, Mike. You all right?

40:23.812 --> 40:26.293
Yeah. You should
see the other guy.[chuckles]

40:26.336 --> 40:28.164
I heard. I'm not surprised.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.558
Appreciate you coming in.I'm glad that you called.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.473
I didn't get a chance
to say thank you.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.257
Mm.

40:38.523 --> 40:41.395
The Backer family
wanted you to have these.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.750
Oh, I got something else
for you, too.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.710
What's this?

40:51.753 --> 40:54.190
Director Vance
pulled some strings.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.760
It's a job offer
with the Marine Warfighting Lab.

40:58.804 --> 41:01.589
Now that LanWar
is out of the picture,

41:01.633 --> 41:02.982
they need a civilian liaison

41:03.025 --> 41:04.897
to design
their training exercises.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.900
Like Danny used to do.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.554
Thank you.

41:11.817 --> 41:13.732
Make him proud.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.127
You make Danny proud.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.261
Ooh-rah.
