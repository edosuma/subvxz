I got your number

if you could install

01:04.814 --> 01:06.232
- Uh, tomorrow? Sure.

I'm not gonna turn you in.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.841
I have a proposition for you.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.927
First, the killing stops.

04:20.969 --> 04:24.597
Anyone gets hurt or killed
or you try to hurt or kill me

04:24.639 --> 04:27.475
or anyone I love,
it triggers an email,

04:27.517 --> 04:31.104

to LAPD Homicide

04:31.146 --> 04:33.440
telling them that
you're the Westside Ripper.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.774
And to prove it,
all they need to do

04:34.816 --> 04:36.860
is match your DNA
to the bloodstained bootie

04:36.901 --> 04:39.654
you left when you killed
Chloe Lake last week.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.992

04:44.034 --> 04:45.076
You can make a run for it,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.703
but you'll never see
your kid again.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.247
You'll be a fugitive until they
hunt you down and kill you.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.999

he's the guy?

- No.
- Great. Another--another win.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.454
- Let's just be smart, okay?
Let's just stop and think here.

we don't need to think.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.566
- No.
- Oh.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.694
How about now?

10:52.736 --> 10:55.155
[tense music]

10:55.196 --> 10:58.241
- [sighs] Her? Her.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.201
Oh, right.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.829
That's the bartender
from Lucky's.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.289
- Yeah.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.332
You're just now
remembering her?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.835
- Well, you know,
I'm a coach here, it's LA.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.503
You know,
you meet a lot of people.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.006
- Yeah. It's LA.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.424
- It does look like you were
kind of friendly,

11:14.466 --> 11:15.967
the way you were looking
at her.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.677
- Yeah, I just didn't
put it all together.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.179
She was killed?
- Yeah.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.181
- Trying to stop this guy
before he does it again.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.974
- Sure.
Yeah, we gotta stop him.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.268
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.603
- You remember her
leaving the bar

11:26.644 --> 11:28.021
the night she was killed?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.148
She with anyone?
- Uh, no.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.734
I'm--I'm not sure.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.445
- Well, if you remember
anything,

11:35.487 --> 11:38.198
or just want to comp me
a free spin class,

11:38.239 --> 11:40.200
give me a call, okay?
- Great.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.117
It's so nice to meet you.
Thanks.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.410
- Last thing.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.038
Who's this guy?

11:45.080 --> 11:46.373
We're trying to talk
to everyone.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.832
We haven't been able to ID him.

11:47.874 --> 11:54.547
* *

11:54.589 --> 11:56.925
- Yeah.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.593
That's Matt Pierce.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.056
He's a friend of mine.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.724
- You have his number?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.394
- His number?
- Yeah.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.729
[Lesley Gore's "Sunshine,
Lollipops and Rainbows"]

12:09.771 --> 12:11.564
[sizzling]

12:11.606 --> 12:14.567
- * Sunshine, lollipops,
and rainbows *

12:14.609 --> 12:17.070
* Everything that's wonderful
is what I feel *

12:17.112 --> 12:18.738
- Such a good boy, Duke.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.074
[indistinct chatter]

12:21.116 --> 12:22.617
- So what are you proposing?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.119
- I'm saying that they
gotta go somewhere,

12:24.160 --> 12:25.704
but--'cause if you move them
from Venice,

12:25.745 --> 12:26.871
they just go to Santa Monica.

12:26.913 --> 12:27.872
- You know what?
You should tweet that out.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.416
- Where's Nathan?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.543
- I don't know,
he must've gotten held up.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.378
- Hey, Newsom says
you can't regulate

12:33.420 --> 12:34.796
public spaces,
but that's the thing--

12:34.838 --> 12:36.756
then the homeless are just
gonna regulate it for you.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.049
- You can't say "the homeless."

12:38.091 --> 12:40.010
It's not a zombie army.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.970
- What? Can I say vagrant?
- No.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.848
- Oh, my God.
- No. No.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.141
No, you can't say vagrant.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.392
- Jesus fuck--

12:47.434 --> 12:49.144
- Okay, what about hobo?
Can I say hobo?

12:49.185 --> 12:51.187
- It's unhoused. Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.023
- Can we change the subject?
- Yes.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.607
- So did you end up
booking the trip?

12:54.649 --> 12:57.068
- Hey.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.738
- Where the hell have you been?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.114
- The cops came to the club.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.992
- Wait. what?

13:04.034 --> 13:05.285
- We're gonna stop this now.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.661
We're gonna stop
this whole insane thing.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.038
- Okay, let's--
come over here for a second.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.164
Well, just what happened?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.373
- They asked me
if I knew the dead girl.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.833
I panicked and said no.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.294
Then they showed me a photo
of me with the dead girl.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.795
- You need to stay calm
'cause you look crazy.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.298
- So they know I lied.
They know I'm hiding something.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.468
And then they started
asking me about--hello.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.388
- Hi.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.974
- About Matt.
- What?

13:28.016 --> 13:29.184
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.227
- That shitty bar
had cameras everywhere.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.645
There's 100 photos of me

13:32.687 --> 13:34.189
hanging out
with a serial killer.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.440
They asked me for
his fucking phone number.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.816
- All right, let's--come here.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.568
Look, they obviously don't
think you're the unsub,

13:38.610 --> 13:40.070
so we're good.
- The what?

13:40.111 --> 13:42.197
- The unidentified subject,
all right?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.656
You were able to deflect,
so that's good.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.117
- How was I able to deflect?
I know the dead girl.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.577
I know the killer.
That's not deflection.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.287
That's "come arrest me."
- Listen.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.873
We're in the big leagues now.
We have stepped up.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.166
There's gonna be pressure.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.501
You remember what
Billie Jean King said.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.627
- Please don't
Billie Jean King me.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.795
- I'm gonna do it.
- Don't, don't.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.839
- I'm gonna do it.
Pressure is a privilege.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.758
We have never felt pressure
before because

14:01.800 --> 14:03.885
we've never been in the game.
- What game?

14:03.927 --> 14:06.471
- The game of life, man, okay?
The real game.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.806
Not the game
you and I have been playing.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.641
The real one where
people take fucking risks

14:09.683 --> 14:12.644
and you might flame out,
but maybe, just maybe,

14:12.686 --> 14:13.770
you might fucking soar

14:13.812 --> 14:15.063
and get the life
we've always dreamed of

14:15.105 --> 14:16.189
and not have to stress

14:16.231 --> 14:17.565
when the fucking
InSinkErator breaks.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.359
And you feel like
you've already failed your baby

14:19.401 --> 14:20.944
when it hasn't even
been born yet.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.070
So come on. Let's do this.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.447
Don't throw it away yet.
- Throw it away?

14:24.489 --> 14:25.615
We don't know
where the serial killer is.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.117
We don't know
what he's thinking.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.119
All we do know is
the cops are up my ass.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.704
I go down,
that's aiding and abetting.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.871
That's 30 years.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.707
You want to come visit me
in San Quentin?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.458
Midnight express me
under the table?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.501
- What is that?
- You know.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.544
- You look like
you're sweeping.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.421
I don't do that.
Why would I do that?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.755
- It doesn't matt--
- Okay, just--

14:40.797 --> 14:42.173
[phone buzzing]

14:42.215 --> 14:43.717
Mm. It's him.
- Shh.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.343
- Okay, okay, listen.
It's him. Stop, stop.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.720
We got--he's gonna counter.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.138
Let's just hear
what he has to say, please.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.848
Do not hang up.
Are you ou--

14:49.889 --> 14:52.100
- Tomorrow we go to the cops,
we turn him in,

14:52.142 --> 14:53.393
we rejoin the human race.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.811
That's what we're gonna do.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.730
- No.
- I'm out.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.232
* *

15:03.945 --> 15:05.238
[laughter]
- How does it work?

15:05.280 --> 15:06.781
- So it's like a two-for-one.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.617
First I do a story unboxing it,

15:09.659 --> 15:13.830
and then I do a second story
trying on the bikinis.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.082
- All I know is, we get all
kinds of free shit showing up.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.793
- So you're opening boxes,
you're looking at them,

15:18.835 --> 15:21.629
you're talking about them.
- Trying them on.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.465
- And that's it.
- And people are watching this.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.674
- Yes, it's a haul.
It's like...

15:24.716 --> 15:25.925
- Theoretically.
- Unboxing.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.220
- [laughs]
- Why is it that funny?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.306
- Hey, do you have
a birth plan?

15:31.348 --> 15:33.016
- A what?
- A birth plan.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.476
- You're dropping in,
like, two months,

15:34.517 --> 15:35.560
and you don't have
a birth plan.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.936
- Do I need one?
- You need to tell them,

15:36.978 --> 15:39.564
like, what music you want,
what drugs you want,

15:39.606 --> 15:40.899
and who's gonna go downtown

15:40.940 --> 15:41.858
and who's gonna stay up
at the Paris end.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.276
- Ew.
- I have a birth plan.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.694
Not even pregnant.
- Uh, Richard,

15:44.736 --> 15:46.446
what were you saying
about the--earlier?

15:46.488 --> 15:47.989
The school's...
- The school's position

15:48.031 --> 15:50.742
is that everyone has
unconscious racial bias

15:50.784 --> 15:52.535
and the more we deny it...

15:52.577 --> 15:54.496
- You doing okay here?

15:54.537 --> 15:56.664
- So the more you deny it...
- You miss us?

15:56.706 --> 15:59.501
- The more biased you are.
- Yes.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.586
- We miss you.
- I agree with that.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.464
Only a true witch would deny
they're a witch.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.425
Duke, oh, come here, boy.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.677
Oh.
- Guilty.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.178
- [laughs] It's true.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.930
- You're such a good boy.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.018
- Hey, uh, Nate.
- Hey.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.021
- How's the club?
- Uh, club is great.

16:20.063 --> 16:24.693
- Oh, my gosh, last week
I did Live Ball with Mason.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.903
- I love Mason.
- More Mason, please.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.364
- What about his, like, teeny,
little, tiny shorts?

16:29.406 --> 16:30.699
- Those are not
regulation shorts.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.866
- I love his butt.
- Right?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.868
That butt launched
1,000 jerk-offs.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.538
- [laughs] You should have him
coach more Live Ball.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.248
All the ladies and gentlemen

16:38.289 --> 16:40.875
love him.
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.877
- Yeah, no, they, um--
everybody seems to really--

16:42.919 --> 16:44.713
- Actually,
Nathan decided to step away

16:44.754 --> 16:47.799
from the director role.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.676
- Oh.
- You did? What?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.553
- Oh.
- Uh, sorry. We didn't...

16:51.594 --> 16:53.555
- No, no. Not sorry.
He loves it.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.640
He's working with the juniors,
actually.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.851
It's more satisfying
working with kids, so...

16:57.892 --> 16:59.561
- That's--totally.
That's great.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.229
- Everybody likes kids.
- He's loving it.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.440
- Yeah.
- I got fired.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.403
- Well, okay, that's not
exactly how it went down.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.113
- No, they fired my ass.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.614
- Wait.
- Uh...

17:11.656 --> 17:13.783
- Apparently,
I'm a middle-aged fuck.

17:13.825 --> 17:14.743
- Mm.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.037
- And Mason's got
big dick energy.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.873
- That is bullshit 'cause
you've got big dick energy.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.709
- Yes.
- You've got huge dick energy.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.669
- You've got a massive penis.
- Yes. Yes.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.879
- You can see it from here.
- Tripod.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.172
- Yeah, buddy.
- It's a big one.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.423
- [laughs]

17:28.465 --> 17:29.924
- We talk about your dick
sometimes.

17:29.966 --> 17:30.800
It's huge.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.218
- Come on.
- Do you?

17:32.260 --> 17:34.095
- I do.
- Fuck them.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.805
You know what? Fuck them.
- Fuck them.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.640
- Fuck them.
- Fuck that small dick club.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.808
- And you know what?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.518
You're, like,
the best coach ever.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.354
- Yeah, you're a good friend.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.772
- We'll fucking quit, buddy.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.023
all: Yes.
- We're gonna all quit.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.316
- Yes, we should quit
right now.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.068
- We're gonna all quit.
- I mean, he'll quit.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.612
- Guys, guys, I'm cool.
Honestly.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.114
I mean, you know me.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.283
I always land on my feet.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.452
[tense music]

17:57.494 --> 18:00.622
[water running]

18:09.756 --> 18:11.675
You loser.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.179
You fucking loser.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.390
Oh, you fucking loser.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.474
[muffled scream]

18:19.516 --> 18:20.850
- Ooh, good job, baby.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.269
There we go. Mm, mm.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.897
- He's literally a ten, right?

18:25.939 --> 18:28.066
- I mean, so Simon just
doesn't even care?

18:28.108 --> 18:32.070
He's just busy just having sex
with your bikini waxer?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.655
- I have a little story
to tell you.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.865
So I actually went to her
the other day, right?

18:35.907 --> 18:38.702
And I kept, like,
sliding down the chair.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.662
Just to, like, really get
her face in it.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.871
You know?
- Oh, my God.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.707
- Like, clean my house.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.667
- That's...
- Reasonable.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.128
- Very visual. Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.714
I mean, look at this one.
- Wow.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.008
- There's something
about his arms.

18:53.049 --> 18:57.178
They're not, like,
white and flabby like Simon's.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.764
Honestly, it's not even about
the amazing sex.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.475
It's like,
Simon is a trust fund baby.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.685
- Yeah.
- Right?

19:03.727 --> 19:05.603
You know we don't even own
this house?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.856
His parents just gave it to us.
- Wow.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.358
- And Carlos, he's--
he's a go-getter.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.610
I mean, he has
those three gyms in LA.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.237
He wants to open a fourth
in New York.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.990
He's pitching that TV show,
you know?

19:17.032 --> 19:18.825
And it's like, he's ambitious.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.745
He takes risks.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.247
Just really sexy.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.207
- Yeah, no, I get that.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.834
- Look at this one.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.705
How you doing?

20:07.457 --> 20:09.501
Hey, I, uh...

20:09.542 --> 20:11.878
I got you a chocolate croissant
from the counter.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.214
[clears throat]
- I'm not here for croissants.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.300
- Oh, you sure?
Man, they're so good.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.763
[moans] Mmm.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.598
Hey, you ever read
"Harry Potter"?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.475
- What?
- "Harry Potter."

20:25.517 --> 20:27.769
I've been reading them
to Ollie.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.938
The first three books
are amazing.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.565
And then suddenly, bam.
"Goblet of Fire."

20:32.607 --> 20:34.234
What the fuck?

20:34.275 --> 20:35.819
752 fucking pages?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.404
It's exhausting.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.781
And if you give up, then
you're a shitty dad, right?

20:43.660 --> 20:46.037
And then I realized

20:46.079 --> 20:48.581
"Goblet of Fire" isn't a book.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.625
It's a test.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.836
A test to all the fathers
of the world.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.921
A test of our dedication.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.090
A test of our commitment.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.467
- The fuck you talking about?

20:59.509 --> 21:02.887
- And as I was reading
"Goblet of Fire" last night,

21:02.929 --> 21:04.764
it struck me.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.686
You took a while
to call me back.

21:11.354 --> 21:15.525
Maybe you aren't really
committed to your proposal.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.986
Maybe you'll cut and run,

21:18.028 --> 21:19.946
throw me under the bus.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.865
[tense music]

21:21.906 --> 21:26.202
Maybe you're a dad who won't
finish "Goblet of Fire."

21:26.244 --> 21:28.997
* *

21:29.039 --> 21:31.291
- The police came to my work.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.876
- [muffled] Oh, yeah?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.753
- They have footage of me
with Chloe Lake.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.713
They have footage
of the two of us together.

21:36.755 --> 21:40.133
I'm fully in no matter what.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.554
What about you?

21:44.596 --> 21:46.514
Are you in or out?

- Hi.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.695
- Hey, is, uh--is Nate okay?

22:00.737 --> 22:02.322
He seemed kind of down
last night.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.657
- Uh, yeah, no,
he's--he's fine.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.744
He's--I think last night
he had a little too much red.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.371
- I love him. You know that.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.915
He's one of my oldest friends,
but I don't know.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.918
Last few years,
he's kind of shut himself off.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.378
He hardly talks to any of us.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.755
- Yeah, no, he just
kind of keeps a lot inside,

22:18.797 --> 22:21.174
but he's--he's good.

22:21.216 --> 22:23.635
We're--he's good. We're good.

22:23.677 --> 22:26.012
- Okay.
- Thank you.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.558
- I do need to talk to you
about one other thing.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.186
Um, I'm sorry.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.146
But I have to take you
off Palisades.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.815
- What? No, no, no, no.
I need that listing.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.900
- The owners wanted you off
or they're taking it elsewhere.

22:38.942 --> 22:41.152
- Okay, the price tag is
way too high.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.904
I've been telling them.
- Maybe.

22:42.946 --> 22:46.074
But you had it for six weeks

22:46.116 --> 22:48.243
and it didn't move.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.453
Do you have anything else
in the pipeline?

22:50.495 --> 22:52.247
- Yeah, of course. Always.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.541
I, um--in fact, I met a buyer
last week at Palisades

22:54.582 --> 22:57.627
and he just put in a big
cash offer on Avondale.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.754
- That sold.
- What?

22:59.796 --> 23:01.006
- They accepted an offer
this morning.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.383
Some family from out of state.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.262
- Okay, well, this--this--
my guy's very motivated,

23:07.303 --> 23:09.597
and I have more options
to show him.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.933
- Okay, great.

23:11.975 --> 23:15.103
But in the meanwhile,

23:15.145 --> 23:17.022
why don't you go back
to the apartment space?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.314
Huh?
- Apartments?

23:18.356 --> 23:19.858
- You're so good in that world.

23:19.899 --> 23:26.990

23:29.409 --> 23:32.203
- You're definitely
not gonna eat that?

23:32.245 --> 23:33.496
May I?

23:35.665 --> 23:37.375
- Here you go.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.753
- So--thank you so much.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.129
- You're welcome.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.506
- I love your shoes.

23:45.675 --> 23:48.511
So, uh, who have you told

23:48.553 --> 23:51.348
about your allegation?

23:52.807 --> 23:55.060
- No one.
- Ava?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.729
- No one.
Why would--Ava doesn't know.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.732
Nobody knows.
- Hmm.

24:00.774 --> 24:01.858
Well, how'd you come up
with it?

24:01.900 --> 24:04.110
I mean, it's pretty crazy.

24:05.945 --> 24:06.946
- Really?
You want me to go through it?

24:06.988 --> 24:08.615
- Yeah.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.367
- The blood, the scratches,

24:10.408 --> 24:12.494
you followed the girl
out of the bar.

24:12.535 --> 24:16.331
- Hmm, still, I mean,
it's kind of a leap.

24:16.373 --> 24:20.001
- Like the girl you killed
in Pomona.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.128
I looked it up.

24:22.170 --> 24:25.215
I bet you there's a shit ton
of forensics all over

24:25.256 --> 24:27.175
the Westside Ripper murders
that lead to you,

24:27.217 --> 24:29.010
so we could pretend
this isn't happening,

24:29.052 --> 24:31.763
but it's happening.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.598
And we need to deal with it.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.601
[tense music]

24:36.643 --> 24:41.940
- And you came up with
all of this by yourself.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.067
- Are you in or out?

24:44.109 --> 24:46.528
I'm not asking again.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.782
- All right, buddy.

24:50.824 --> 24:53.576
I'm gonna give you some advice,
because I really like you,

24:53.618 --> 24:56.913
and because it's really hard
to make friends in LA, right?

24:56.955 --> 25:01.042
I would strongly urge you
to drop this.

25:02.252 --> 25:06.673
Because, Nathan, this...

25:06.715 --> 25:09.342
will not end well for you.

25:10.593 --> 25:14.139
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

25:14.180 --> 25:16.766
but eventually.

I guarantee it.

- Fuck you.

Dahmer lasted in county?

in this dress.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.383
* So let that feeling *

29:18.425 --> 29:20.385
* Grab you deep inside *

29:20.427 --> 29:22.762
* And send you reeling *

29:22.804 --> 29:24.723
* Where your love can't hide *

29:24.764 --> 29:27.308
* And then go stealing *

29:27.350 --> 29:29.185
* Through the moonlit nights *

29:29.227 --> 29:31.312
* With your lover *

29:31.354 --> 29:33.523
* *

29:33.565 --> 29:35.692
* Just let your love flow *

29:35.734 --> 29:37.819
* Like a mountain stream *

29:37.861 --> 29:40.071
* And let your love grow *

29:40.113 --> 29:42.282
* With the smallest
of dreams *

29:42.323 --> 29:44.576
* And let your love show *

29:44.617 --> 29:46.828
* And you'll know
what I mean *

29:46.870 --> 29:48.538
* It's the season *

29:48.580 --> 29:50.665
both: Nice shot, Dad!
