00:03.500 --> 00:06.500
Dooku Captured

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Written by Julie Siege
Directed by Jesse Yeh

00:17.079 --> 00:17.877
Manhunt!

00:18.258 --> 00:20.350
After a long and perilous search,

00:20.351 --> 00:23.988
the Jedi finally track down
Separatist leader, Count Dooku.

00:24.189 --> 00:26.515
During a heroic attempt to capture the Count,

00:26.516 --> 00:28.795
Anakin Skywalker has gone missing.

00:29.268 --> 00:31.189
Having lost contact with Skywalker,

00:31.490 --> 00:34.968
Obi-Wan Kenobi heads towards
his friend's last known location,

00:35.261 --> 00:39.396
a lone Separatist frigate in the
far reaches of the Outer Rim....

01:14.193 --> 01:15.397
Wonder.

01:15.893 --> 01:17.606
Don't bother to get up.

01:17.607 --> 01:19.229
You're not the prisoner I'm looking for.

01:31.695 --> 01:33.172
Oh, it's you.

01:33.465 --> 01:35.722
This is how you thank me for rescuing you?

01:35.723 --> 01:37.240
Pounce me from the ceiling?

01:37.331 --> 01:40.148
Kind of difficult without a lightsaber.

01:40.332 --> 01:41.093
Thanks.

01:41.157 --> 01:44.072
Did you manage to locate Dooku befor land in jail?

01:44.083 --> 01:45.378
I know he's on board.

01:45.569 --> 01:48.444
Might be able to do something
about it if I had my weapon.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.967
It was important for you to arrive without it.

01:50.968 --> 01:52.922
So your capture would be convincing.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.575
Oh, he would be convinced alright.

01:54.576 --> 01:57.125
But how can I'm the one getting caught all the time?

01:57.300 --> 01:58.393
It doesn't look good.

01:58.593 --> 02:01.870
When you're a Jedi Master,
you can make the plan.

02:02.197 --> 02:03.229
That's just it.

02:03.230 --> 02:05.765
How can I become a Jedi Master
if I'm always getting caught?

02:05.766 --> 02:08.583
At least you're a master at getting caught.

02:08.693 --> 02:09.737
Very funny.

02:12.662 --> 02:14.401
Surprise, surprise.

02:16.373 --> 02:17.936
If it isn't Count Dooku.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.728
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

02:19.829 --> 02:24.665
I thought I sensed an unpleasant
disturbance in the Force.

02:24.667 --> 02:27.433
I see you've freed young Skywalker.

02:27.463 --> 02:32.435
Where might he be if you weren't
always around to rescue him?

02:33.333 --> 02:35.779
Sir, there's a Jedi cruiser attacking.

02:39.050 --> 02:42.200
Let's try not to blow up the ship
before they get off this time.

02:43.026 --> 02:44.751
Your ship is surrounded, Count.

02:44.919 --> 02:47.100
Republic troops are boarding as we speak.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.181
Jedi fools.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.890
I should have seen that coming.

02:51.891 --> 02:53.078
What are you doing?

02:53.079 --> 02:53.840
Following him.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.825
Not that way.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.136
We need to cut him off.

02:56.137 --> 02:56.865
You cut him off.

02:56.866 --> 02:58.866
I'll follow him and meet you at the hangar.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.253
Why do I even try?

03:14.119 --> 03:15.550
Oh, great.

03:17.527 --> 03:19.182
Your ship is ready, sir.

03:19.185 --> 03:20.091
Good.

03:44.401 --> 03:46.317
I thought you were following Dooku.

03:46.318 --> 03:47.230
I was.

03:47.231 --> 03:48.301
I followed him here.

03:49.243 --> 03:50.243
Hang on.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.553
Ahsoka, Dooku managed to escape.

04:03.554 --> 04:05.983
We're in pursuit, but we
could use reinforcements.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.879
Follow us in what ships you can round up.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.965
We'll get there as soon as we can.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.298
That was easy.

04:26.018 --> 04:28.001
Lucky for you, I'm an excellent shot.

04:28.111 --> 04:30.257
Well, now those fighters are attacking.

04:30.258 --> 04:31.243
I'm on it.

04:31.574 --> 04:33.638
Uh, he's getting too close.

04:41.791 --> 04:44.916
Lucky for you, I'm an excellent pilot.

04:51.573 --> 04:55.272
For all your expertise, this
is not a very smooth landing.

04:58.253 --> 05:02.253
And if you'd hit that second fighter,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

05:12.559 --> 05:14.328
I've had better landings.

05:14.729 --> 05:15.465
Dooku.

05:24.194 --> 05:26.523
What's this, a homing beacon?

05:27.100 --> 05:30.294
Which means the distinguished Count is waiting for help.

05:30.295 --> 05:31.980
So he can't be far off.

05:32.011 --> 05:33.384
His engine is damaged.

05:33.385 --> 05:34.651
He's not going anywhere.

05:34.732 --> 05:36.737
Not without a homing beacon.

05:42.325 --> 05:42.955
There.

05:43.138 --> 05:44.617
Caves are a good start.

05:49.250 --> 05:50.411
Strange.

05:51.710 --> 05:52.786
You sense it too.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.311
Many life forms in there.

05:55.103 --> 05:56.498
And Dooku's one of them.

05:57.465 --> 05:59.850
Let's try to get him before something else does.

06:17.368 --> 06:18.223
What's that?

06:22.310 --> 06:23.060
Run!

06:49.220 --> 06:52.840
You won't be needing this anymore, Skywalker.

07:38.110 --> 07:39.000
Well, well.

07:39.450 --> 07:40.970
What do we have here?

07:42.870 --> 07:43.840
Who are you?

07:44.360 --> 07:47.920
More importantly, my friend, who are you?

07:57.270 --> 07:58.100
Master!

07:58.350 --> 07:59.820
Obi-Wan, can you hear me?

08:00.320 --> 08:01.280
Master!

08:13.010 --> 08:15.090
Anakin, when I tell you to run, run.

08:15.850 --> 08:16.440
Master!

08:16.780 --> 08:17.650
You're alive.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.030
And where's your lightsaber?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.060
It got knocked out of my hand.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.400
By a rock?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.870
Yeah, by a rock.

08:24.210 --> 08:25.350
It's got to be here somewhere.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.790
That is a feeble excuse.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.770
You know what would be helpful?

08:28.770 --> 08:29.750
A little light.

08:29.950 --> 08:30.480
Certainly.

08:34.659 --> 08:35.630
Silly thing.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.650
It was just working a minute ago.

08:38.490 --> 08:41.620
You don't suppose it was hit by a rock, do you?

08:45.300 --> 08:47.940
Oh, this should be interesting.

08:58.150 --> 09:01.880
Your solar sailor is very beautiful.

09:02.430 --> 09:06.060
It's a pretty rare ship, very expensive.

09:06.910 --> 09:10.230
What are you doing all the way out here?

09:10.660 --> 09:15.210
I sustained some damage in an asteroid storm and had to make a landing.

09:15.610 --> 09:17.990
Feel free to help yourself to it.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.470
If you need transport, the nearest planet is Florrum.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.420
It's six parsecs away.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.540
Is it civilized?

09:29.120 --> 09:31.570
That depends on your definition of civilized.

09:32.570 --> 09:35.290
But you would certainly be more comfortable there than here.

09:36.060 --> 09:39.530
Vanqor is no place to be after dark.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.370
Perhaps I shall take you up on your offer.

09:42.770 --> 09:43.830
Very good.

09:44.220 --> 09:47.920
Now all that's left to do is settle my fee.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.430
Fee?

09:49.430 --> 09:53.010
Just a little something to cover my expenses.

09:53.450 --> 09:58.870
It shouldn't be a problem for someone so obviously wealthy as yourself.

10:00.610 --> 10:04.040
I'd be happy to compensate you for your services.

10:04.900 --> 10:05.890
That's it, boys!

10:06.410 --> 10:07.220
We are heading home.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.070
Jump in anytime!

10:12.550 --> 10:13.920
Oh, you're doing fine.

10:14.330 --> 10:15.250
She seems to like you.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.640
Yeah, lucky me!

10:18.570 --> 10:21.020
This isn't as much fun as it looks.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.880
I thought Gundarks were only found on Vanqor.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.800
Then this system must be Vanqor.

10:30.070 --> 10:31.550
So that would make this one...

10:31.760 --> 10:33.020
The mother of all Gundarks.

10:33.300 --> 10:33.870
Precisely.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.090
Are you gonna help me?

10:44.390 --> 10:46.400
Well, you took your time.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.370
It's a pity.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.560
I was just starting to sense a connection.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.210
Should I leave you two alone,

11:07.630 --> 11:10.800
or would you prefer to find a way out of this hole before she wakes up?

11:35.380 --> 11:37.480
Welcome to Florrum.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.740
Lose your flashy sword?

11:43.230 --> 11:46.330
Are these what you were looking for, Jedi?

11:47.130 --> 11:50.140
I am more powerful than any Jedi.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.670
Know that you are dealing with a Sith Lord.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.210
You're still outnumbered.

11:57.590 --> 12:02.260
The leader of the clanker army and a Sith Lord, no less.

12:03.310 --> 12:06.250
Someone is sure to pay a pretty price for you.

12:06.670 --> 12:10.090
Provide me with the proper means of communications.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.910
I will arrange for any ransom to be paid.

12:14.350 --> 12:17.490
And you will arrange for your armies to crush us as well.

12:17.990 --> 12:21.440
You don't survive in the Outer Rim by being stupid.

12:21.830 --> 12:29.220
If the Separatists will pay to get you back, chances are, the Republic will offer even more.

12:34.730 --> 12:36.070
Sounds like another Gundark.

12:36.370 --> 12:38.110
It's too far away to worry about.

12:38.430 --> 12:40.070
It won't stay far away.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.200
New problem.

12:50.950 --> 12:51.880
That's not good.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.100
It's just gas.

12:53.120 --> 12:53.870
Yes.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.270
Probably toxic gas.

12:56.120 --> 12:56.900
That's good.

12:57.450 --> 12:58.840
Maybe it'll kill your Gundark.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.850
And maybe it will kill us.

13:01.970 --> 13:02.700
Come on.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.320
Let's get out of here.

13:07.590 --> 13:08.710
This isn't gonna work.

13:09.390 --> 13:10.400
I can't breathe.

13:10.930 --> 13:13.210
As always, I'm open to sugges-

13:15.410 --> 13:16.500
Come on, Obi-Wan.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.140
Don't give up now.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.030
What was that?

13:27.030 --> 13:28.390
I have no idea.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.440
Master!

13:33.520 --> 13:35.180
Looks like I got here just in time.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.790
What do you mean, just in time?

13:37.790 --> 13:39.490
You were in very big trouble.

13:39.960 --> 13:40.410
Trouble?

13:40.700 --> 13:42.530
We were simply searching for Count Dooku.

13:43.300 --> 13:43.990
Yeah.

13:44.550 --> 13:47.560
We had the situation well under control, my little Padawan.

13:47.970 --> 13:48.950
Oh, I see.

13:49.430 --> 13:52.300
So which part of the situation did you have under control:

13:52.720 --> 13:56.770
the blocked entrance, the poison gas, or that Gundark behind you?

13:57.210 --> 13:57.880
Gundark?

13:57.950 --> 14:01.590
Oh, you mean the one that's too far away to worry about?

14:03.540 --> 14:04.510
Block the entrance.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.250
There's still Dooku to deal with.

14:14.650 --> 14:15.450
You let him get away?

14:16.430 --> 14:19.570
No, not get away exactly.

14:19.870 --> 14:21.340
Just...

14:21.430 --> 14:23.380
Chime in anytime.

14:25.080 --> 14:25.730
Oh, no.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.510
I'm enjoying this far too much.

14:29.820 --> 14:34.190
If you want the Sith Lord, it will cost you a million credits.

14:34.800 --> 14:39.900
The payment will be in spice delivered in an unarmed diplomatic ship.

14:40.410 --> 14:44.770
We will need proof he's alive before agreeing to your terms.

14:45.460 --> 14:49.010
Let me present your fearless Sith Lord.

14:50.910 --> 14:53.560
I'm afraid he's too embarrassed to speak.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.760
A hologram can be faked.

14:57.820 --> 14:58.980
You want proof?

14:59.930 --> 15:02.100
This is his lightsaber.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.030
Hmm. Yes.

15:04.510 --> 15:06.550
Belongs to Dooku, that lightsaber does.

15:07.810 --> 15:12.040
This scum having possession of Dooku's lightsaber proves nothing.

15:13.430 --> 15:20.600
If you refuse, I am sure the Separatist council will be more than willing to meet my price.

15:21.450 --> 15:23.970
We may never have a better chance to capture Count Dooku.

15:25.980 --> 15:31.960
We would like to send two Jedi to confirm you have Count Dooku before delivering the ransom.

15:33.910 --> 15:36.040
Send your Jedi, but they must be unarmed.

15:36.370 --> 15:36.950
Impossible.

15:37.430 --> 15:38.840
They will be safe.

15:39.780 --> 15:43.220
We have no interest in getting involved in your war.

15:46.950 --> 15:49.910
We've reestablished contact with Kenobi and Skywalker.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.060
They're in a system close to Florrum.

15:52.630 --> 15:55.750
And most eager to find Dooku, they are.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.690
His only stipulation is that you arrive unarmed.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.150
Unarmed?

16:06.780 --> 16:08.610
We know very little about these pirates.

16:08.940 --> 16:12.530
We may be walking blind into what could very well be a hostile situation.

16:12.910 --> 16:14.770
We can't let Dooku slip through our fingers again.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.580
Report back as soon as you arrive.

16:18.450 --> 16:19.800
Well, this should be fun.

16:53.040 --> 16:53.860
Follow me.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.310
Gentlemen.

17:20.849 --> 17:22.450
Can I offer you something to drink?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.369
No, thank you.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.940
Congratulations on your capture of Count Dooku.

17:32.390 --> 17:33.330
Very impressive.

17:33.860 --> 17:34.880
Yes, it was.

17:35.470 --> 17:38.940
Eh, even a Sith Lord is no match for my warriors.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.620
He put up quite a fight: blasters, cannons, that glowy thing.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.240
You mean a lightsaber?

17:49.240 --> 17:49.620
That's it.

17:50.170 --> 17:54.240
And I don't need to tell you, those things can do some damage.

17:54.950 --> 17:59.040
Carved up some of my best men pretty good before I could get the jump on him.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.410
And how exactly did you get the jump on him?

18:03.010 --> 18:03.520
With this?

18:14.240 --> 18:17.210
We have no interest in disagreeing with you.

18:17.890 --> 18:22.560
All we want is to confirm you are holding Dooku, and we'll go.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.500
I will arrange a meeting.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.420
Look how the mighty Sith Lord has fallen.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.610
This place suits you, Count.

18:38.670 --> 18:45.110
It wasn't so long ago that you yourself were in similar surroundings on my ship.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.520
Yeah, but now I'm free, and you're not.

18:50.150 --> 18:54.820
I'm confident the situation will rectify itself soon.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.275
Soon you'll be brought to trial by the Senate

18:58.276 --> 19:02.310
and most likely spend a very long time in a cell just like this one.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.480
And that's if you're lucky.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.000
Oh, my naive young Jedi.

19:08.380 --> 19:15.260
You must be overly optimistic if you think these Weequayans plan to let you leave this planet.

19:16.210 --> 19:19.060
They're planet-hopping thieves looking for a quick score.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.970
They have no interest in picking a fight with Jedi.

19:22.520 --> 19:27.710
They are devious and deceitful and, most importantly, stupid.

19:28.150 --> 19:30.480
It's a wonder you don't get along with them, Dooku.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.710
You have so much in common.

19:33.650 --> 19:37.630
You underestimate them at your own peril, Kenobi.

19:42.930 --> 19:45.480
I don't know about you, but I could use some rest.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.890
Rember, Anakin, this could still be a trap.

19:48.470 --> 19:49.690
You're not worried about Dooku, are you?

19:50.270 --> 19:52.930
No, I'm worried about these pirates.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.010
Jedi!

19:59.560 --> 20:01.395
Now that your business is completed,

20:01.396 --> 20:04.500
we invite you to join us in the grand hall for a banquet.

20:05.530 --> 20:09.980
And a true Weequay banquet is not to be missed.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.420
No question they have Dooku.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.330
Send the ransom.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.600
He's being securely held?

20:17.770 --> 20:18.220
Yeah.

20:18.540 --> 20:19.820
And very cranky about it.

20:20.210 --> 20:20.780
Good.

20:21.140 --> 20:25.160
Senator Kharrus and Representative Binks will be dispatched immediately.

20:41.010 --> 20:44.910
Now can I persuade you to join us for a drink?

20:45.500 --> 20:49.150
It's a tradition, in the name of friendship.

20:49.150 --> 20:51.490
All right, but nothing too strong.

20:51.830 --> 20:52.530
He's flying.

20:52.930 --> 20:55.730
Bring our guests some refreshments.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.970
To a successful transaction.

21:20.460 --> 21:23.570
To powerful pirates and new friends of the Republic.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.710
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.360
I still don't get it.

21:32.120 --> 21:32.660
Get what?

21:32.890 --> 21:36.600
How a bunch of drunken pirates managed to catch Dooku when we couldn't.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.780
Maybe there's a lesson to be learned here.

21:39.570 --> 21:40.690
I still don't get it.

21:40.690 --> 21:46.260
It's to remind us to be humble and never too proud to accept a gift when it comes our way.

21:46.780 --> 21:49.310
Well, to unexpected gifts, then.

21:49.650 --> 21:50.450
Hear. Hear.
