Baja, Mexico

00:27.370 --> 00:30.347
Whoa, there he is.!
Whoo-hoo-hoo.! Chip.!

00:30.382 --> 00:32.456
- Whoo.!
- Chippy.!

00:32.491 --> 00:34.218
Hey, we see you man.
How you doing?

00:34.253 --> 00:35.808
I'm doing great.
This rocks!

00:35.843 --> 00:36.868
He says it rocks.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.516
Tell him to jump. Jump!

00:39.551 --> 00:42.226
The pilot's a total Nazi.
He made me ditch my beer!

00:42.261 --> 00:44.759
Oh, don't worry, dude. We've got a
couple cold ones down here for you.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.090
Okay, man. Don't drink 'em all.
I wish you guys were up here.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.515
Hey, we didn't win the contest, man.
You did!

00:50.550 --> 00:52.100
Let me see it. Hey, Chip!

00:52.135 --> 00:54.781
Are you gonna jump
or are you wussing out?

00:54.816 --> 00:57.408
I want to see a man jump out
of an airplane.

00:57.443 --> 00:58.940
- Yeah, jump, man!
- Here I go!

00:58.975 --> 01:02.075
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

01:02.110 --> 01:06.326
- There he goes.!
- All right, Chip.!

01:06.361 --> 01:09.198
Whoo.! Chip!

01:09.233 --> 01:13.006
It's Superman.!
Open the chute, man!

01:15.474 --> 01:17.692
Why isn't he opening the chute?

01:21.423 --> 01:23.445
Oh, there's something wrong.
Pull the cord!

01:23.480 --> 01:26.398
- Pull the cord, Chip!
- The cord.!

01:26.433 --> 01:28.941
Oh, my God!

01:35.649 --> 01:40.449
Dios mio.!
Capitan Alameda.!

01:40.484 --> 01:44.385
- Yes, Doctor?
- You say this boy fell?

01:44.420 --> 01:48.398
That is right. From an airplane.
His chute malfunctioned.

01:48.433 --> 01:50.491
Capitan, are you telling me
everything?

01:50.526 --> 01:53.076
Yes, of course.
What else is there to tell?

01:53.111 --> 01:59.287
Well, it is true this boy fell.
There is massive trauma, internal injuries,

01:59.322 --> 02:01.301
but that is not what killed him.

02:01.336 --> 02:03.748
This is impossible.
It's a mistake.

02:03.783 --> 02:07.799
- There is no mistake, Lieutenant.
- "Cause of death..." He drowned?

02:07.834 --> 02:08.985
How could he drown?

02:09.020 --> 02:11.339
He jumped from an airplane.
He landed in the desert.

02:11.374 --> 02:15.110
Well, look for yourselves.
His lungs are filled with water.

02:15.145 --> 02:17.317
This boy drowned.

02:17.352 --> 02:19.120
In midair?

02:20.868 --> 02:23.098
MONK Season 2 Epi. 02
Mr. Monk and the Psychic

02:23.133 --> 02:25.567
"It's a jungle out there"

02:25.602 --> 02:29.607
"Disorder and confusion
everywhere"

02:29.652 --> 02:33.932
"No one seems to care
Well, I do, hey"

02:33.967 --> 02:36.333
"Who's in charge here"

02:36.368 --> 02:40.116
"It's a jungle out there"

02:40.151 --> 02:43.090
"Poison in the very air we breathe"

02:43.125 --> 02:46.433
"Do you know what's in the water
that you drink, well, I do"

02:46.468 --> 02:49.780
"And it's amazing"

02:49.815 --> 02:53.192
"People think I'm crazy
'cause I worry all the time"

02:53.227 --> 02:56.401
"If you paid attention you'd
be worried too"

02:56.436 --> 03:00.702
"You better pay attention
or this world we love so much"

03:00.737 --> 03:04.676
"Might just kill you"

03:04.711 --> 03:07.028
"I could be wrong now"

03:07.063 --> 03:08.879
"But I don't think so"

03:08.914 --> 03:11.887
"'Cause it's a jungle out there"

03:11.922 --> 03:14.912
"It's a jungle out there"

03:29.275 --> 03:32.689
- Can we go now?
- Absolutely.

03:37.822 --> 03:41.303
The letter's mailed.
It can't get any more mailed.

03:43.997 --> 03:48.618
Now what? - It's almost 9:00.
That's the next pickup.

03:48.653 --> 03:50.003
You're gonna wait for the mailman?

03:50.038 --> 03:52.305
I just want to make sure
he doesn't drop anything.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.319
You're lucky I get paid
by the hour, I'm telling you.

03:58.013 --> 04:00.917
- Hey, Monk.
- Captain!

04:00.952 --> 04:05.454
- Sharona.
- Sharona. - Lieutenant.

04:05.489 --> 04:08.181
- What you doing?
- Mailing a letter.

04:08.216 --> 04:10.105
- Where's the letter?
- In the mailbox.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.020
We're waiting for the mailman.

04:12.055 --> 04:14.318
Here he is.

04:14.353 --> 04:17.527
Monk, the mayor
needs your help again.

04:17.562 --> 04:21.240
He's got a friend whose kid was killed
down in Mexico. Kid named Chip Rosatti.

04:21.274 --> 04:24.151
- What happened?
- Skydiving accident.

04:24.186 --> 04:27.204
- His chute didn't open?
- No, he drowned.

04:27.239 --> 04:32.162
- Did he land in the ocean?
- No. Look.

04:32.197 --> 04:37.707
Apparently, the kid jumped out
of an airplane, and he drowned in midair.

04:37.742 --> 04:41.754
That doesn't make a lot of sense.
Hardly any, really.

04:41.789 --> 04:44.753
Which is why the mayor wants you
to go down there and look into it.

04:44.788 --> 04:46.088
It's right up
your very unique alley.

04:46.123 --> 04:47.879
Hey, we can use a vacation.

04:47.914 --> 04:51.425
Now, look, I know how you hate
to fly, so you're gonna have to drive.

04:51.460 --> 04:54.354
And it's a long way to San Macros.
You're gonna have to leave immediately.

04:54.389 --> 04:57.822
Mexico. I can't...
I can't go to Mexico.

04:57.857 --> 05:00.161
Why not?

05:00.196 --> 05:01.970
It's not... here.

05:02.005 --> 05:04.307
You can't say no to the mayor.

05:04.342 --> 05:08.200
- Gail can watch Benjy.
It's a done deal. - Good.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.654
Monk, where you going?

05:10.689 --> 05:12.672
I'm just gonna make sure
he doesn't drop anything.

05:12.707 --> 05:16.706
Oh, no, no.
You gotta go home and pack.

05:16.741 --> 05:18.100
- Lieutenant?
- Sir.

05:18.135 --> 05:21.288
Follow that mailman, and make sure
he doesn't drop anything.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.261
Yes, sir.

05:33.303 --> 05:36.669
We made it. Welcome to Mexico.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.012
- What are those?
- Earplugs.

05:40.047 --> 05:43.852
- You... You've had them in the whole trip?
- Since Los Angeles.

05:43.887 --> 05:46.488
- You haven't heard a word I've said.
- No.

05:46.523 --> 05:49.947
L... I've been talking
the whole time.

05:49.982 --> 05:55.049
- Did you say anything important?
- No.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.766
- Adrian, take off your sunglasses.
- Why?

05:58.801 --> 06:01.256
- You look like a drug dealer.
- No, I don't.

06:01.291 --> 06:04.286
I'm telling you, you do.
You fit the profile perfectly.

06:04.321 --> 06:06.916
You have 18 suitcases
and you're wearing a suit.

06:06.951 --> 06:10.042
I mean, if you were a cop,
wouldn't you think you looked suspicious?

06:10.077 --> 06:12.884
Buenos dias.!
How long will you be in Mexico?

06:12.919 --> 06:16.277
- Two to three days.
- I'm not a drug dealer.

06:16.312 --> 06:21.078
- Pardon me?
- I'm not a drug dealer.

06:21.113 --> 06:26.569
Uh-huh. I want you to park over there
and meet me inside.

06:34.366 --> 06:35.828
Are you opening
a restaurant here, Mr. Monk?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.409
No, I'm not opening a restaurant.

06:37.444 --> 06:39.191
He's kind of particular.

06:39.226 --> 06:41.432
We have bottled water
in Mexico, senor Monk.

06:41.467 --> 06:45.177
- Many fine brands.
- Well, all he drinks is Sierra Springs.

06:45.212 --> 06:49.306
Ah, there he is...
the genius from America,

06:49.341 --> 06:52.844
here to show us simple peasants
how to solve a homicide.

06:52.879 --> 06:57.230
- I have seen this brand here as well.
- Well, you know, better safe than sorry.

06:57.265 --> 06:59.969
Send him home, Captain.
We don't need a babysitter.

07:00.004 --> 07:04.570
I wish I could. But I promised the governor
I would be a gracious host.

07:04.605 --> 07:10.067
- I only hope he doesn't get in my way.
- Uh, one second, sir.

07:10.102 --> 07:12.241
Lieutenant, will you marry me?

07:12.276 --> 07:15.625
- Sir, I...
- I'm joking, Lieutenant.

07:15.660 --> 07:20.424
Those are pillow cases
and backup pillow cases.

07:20.459 --> 07:22.705
- And these are?
- Moist towelettes.

07:22.740 --> 07:27.662
Why so many? - In case I happen to,
you know, meet people.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.732
Senor, I think you have
a very poor image of our country.

07:30.767 --> 07:35.395
Oh, no, no, no. It's not just you.
He thinks everybody is dirty.

07:35.430 --> 07:38.562
- You must be a very lonely man, senor.
- I am. Thank you.

07:38.597 --> 07:41.645
This man is my guest, Sergeant.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.105
Let's, uh, close up their bags
and put 'em in the car.

07:44.140 --> 07:47.518
- Si, Capitan!
- Senor Monk.

07:47.553 --> 07:49.363
- Hi.
- Senorita Fleming.

07:49.398 --> 07:53.605
Bienvenidos.! I am Captain Alameda.
This is Lieutenant Plato.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.791
- Senorita Fleming, welcome to Mexico.
- Oh, well, thank you for inviting us.

07:57.826 --> 07:59.589
We didn't invite you.

07:59.624 --> 08:02.110
In fact, you are wasting your time.

08:02.145 --> 08:04.502
We are going to be making
an arrest on this case very soon.

08:04.537 --> 08:06.850
-You have a suspect?
- Not yet.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.016
- But we have a theory.
- What's that?

08:10.051 --> 08:11.997
- Drugs.
- Drugs?

08:12.032 --> 08:13.759
It's always about the drugs.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.081
Well, his parents swore
he was clean.

08:16.116 --> 08:19.549
Uh, the most he ever had
were a couple of beers.

08:19.584 --> 08:23.352
Hmm. - Captain, how do you explain
the cause of death?

08:23.387 --> 08:25.075
He drowned in midair?

08:25.110 --> 08:28.472
I don't know.
I admit, it sounds baffling.

08:28.507 --> 08:32.558
But at the end of the day,
you will see, it was drugs.

08:32.592 --> 08:39.179
We have the case folder.
We translated it for you. - Oh. Gracias.

08:51.446 --> 08:55.793
I'm afraid the nicer hotels in town were
all booked up with American teenagers.

08:55.828 --> 08:58.593
- It's, uh, spring break.
- Oh, this will be fine.

08:58.628 --> 09:01.465
Oh, I didn't know whether
to book one room or two?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.058
Two! Two rooms. Two.

09:04.093 --> 09:07.191
Uh, dos. Two. Two rooms.

09:07.226 --> 09:09.560
- I think they understand, Sharona.
- Oh, okay.

09:09.595 --> 09:14.278
- Uh, two rooms. - It doesn't
really make any sense, does it?

09:14.313 --> 09:16.972
Nineteen years old,
comes down for spring break,

09:17.007 --> 09:23.671
wins a free skydiving lesson,
goes up in the plane...and drowns.

09:23.706 --> 09:26.366
Drugs. Somehow, drugs.

09:26.401 --> 09:28.969
It is always the drugs.

09:29.004 --> 09:32.245
- Have you spoken to the pilot?
- Yes, many times.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.066
He is as baffled as we are.

09:34.101 --> 09:37.546
He swears the boy was alive and well
when he jumped off the plane.

09:37.581 --> 09:41.142
- Would you like to meet him?
- Eventually, yeah.

09:41.177 --> 09:44.806
First I'd like to talk to the witnesses...
the boy's two friends.

09:44.841 --> 09:46.150
I'll arrange for it.

09:46.185 --> 09:50.154
Give us a call when you've
had a chance to freshen up. - Until later.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.852
- Gracias.
- Por nada.

09:57.645 --> 10:01.830
- What do you think?
- It's weird.

10:01.865 --> 10:05.008
Everything's weird.

10:05.043 --> 10:07.524
It's like another country.

10:10.038 --> 10:13.054
This way, please.
Your bags will be right up.

10:13.089 --> 10:15.590
- Is this your first time in San Macros?
- Yes, it is.

10:15.625 --> 10:19.552
Adrian! Adrian, look.
You can see the plaza.

10:19.587 --> 10:23.153
Senor Monk is in here.
Senorita, you are in the next room.

10:23.188 --> 10:25.226
There is a connecting door.

10:25.261 --> 10:27.972
Well, it locks, right?
There's a lock on the door?

10:28.007 --> 10:28.866
How do you say "lock"?

10:28.901 --> 10:31.659
La cerradura.
Si, there is a lock.

10:31.694 --> 10:34.436
You have air-conditioning
and a minibar...

10:34.471 --> 10:37.266
and the three-way light...
low, medium, high.

10:37.301 --> 10:40.025
This is the only room in
the hotel with a three-way light.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.483
Good thing we called ahead.

10:41.518 --> 10:44.172
Here is a list of things
you cannot flush down the toilet.

10:44.207 --> 10:46.662
Adrian, they have chocolate mints
on the pillows.

10:46.697 --> 10:50.406
Uh, that is not a mint.
Excuse me.

10:55.084 --> 10:58.467
Uh, don't eat the mints.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.672
- Is there a problem?
- Uh, si.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.499
Your bags. They have been
stolen from your car.

11:16.534 --> 11:18.777
- You must have left it unlocked.
- Oh, my God.!

11:18.812 --> 11:21.103
Our bags?
All of them?

11:21.138 --> 11:23.785
I'm afraid so.

11:23.820 --> 11:26.875
These were 18 of them!
That was only five minutes.

11:26.910 --> 11:29.918
It would take a small army
and a U-Haul truck to do that.

11:29.953 --> 11:32.372
Perhaps your friends
in the police can help.

11:32.407 --> 11:36.641
I'm very sorry, senor.
Enjoy your stay.

11:43.429 --> 11:45.845
I'll call Captain Alameda.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.697
They took all my food and water.

11:48.732 --> 11:50.525
What am I gonna eat and drink?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.512
Adrian, they have food
and water in Mexico.

11:52.547 --> 11:56.855
Answer the question!
What am I gonna eat and drink?

12:01.080 --> 12:05.000
Every time I close my eyes,
I can see him falling.

12:05.035 --> 12:08.517
Was he alive when he left the plane?

12:08.552 --> 12:12.254
Yeah, I think so.
I saw him kicking, waving his arms.

12:12.289 --> 12:15.080
- How well did you know Chip?
- I didn't know him at all.

12:15.115 --> 12:17.828
I didn't even know his last name
till I had to identify the body.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.913
We just hooked up the other night
at this club in Rivesta.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.991
And you all just decided
to go parachuting?

12:24.026 --> 12:27.098
No, no. Chip won a free lesson...

12:27.133 --> 12:30.225
or something from this
flight school for one freejump.

12:30.260 --> 12:33.730
He just asked us to come and watch.
It sounded like a blast.

12:33.765 --> 12:36.404
I was talking to him on
his cell phone the entire time.

12:36.439 --> 12:38.941
He sounded scared, but excited.

12:38.976 --> 12:43.012
You know, the coroner said
Chip Rosatti drowned.

12:43.047 --> 12:47.073
- Drowned?
- Does that make any sense to you?

12:48.748 --> 12:52.272
- Something from the bar?
- I'll have an iced tea, thank you.

12:52.307 --> 12:54.373
- Me too, please.
- That sounds good.

12:54.408 --> 12:57.761
- Okay. And for you, senor?
- Do you have any Sierra Springs?

12:57.796 --> 13:01.074
- No. Uh, we have Perrier.
- No, thank you.

13:01.109 --> 13:04.717
Do you know anyone in town
that sells Sierra Springs?

13:04.752 --> 13:06.595
I'm afraid not, senor.

13:06.630 --> 13:09.541
- We have San Pellegrino.
- No, thank you.

13:09.576 --> 13:12.644
- We have Aquafina.
- I don't think so.

13:12.679 --> 13:14.868
- We have Polaris.
- No.

13:14.903 --> 13:16.146
- Arrowhead.
- No, thank you.

13:16.181 --> 13:17.701
- Deer Park.
- No.

13:17.736 --> 13:22.068
We have Evian. it's delicious, senor.
It's our best seller.

13:22.103 --> 13:27.816
It is?
No, thank you.

13:27.851 --> 13:30.047
I'm sort of used to Sierra Springs.

13:30.082 --> 13:31.703
We have Aqua Fresca.

13:31.738 --> 13:34.483
It's owned by the same company
that bottles Sierra Springs.

13:34.518 --> 13:37.473
They use the same water, senor.

13:38.331 --> 13:40.836
- No.
- But it's the same water, senor.

13:40.871 --> 13:44.339
- It's just a different label.
- Adrian, it's the same water.

13:44.374 --> 13:47.164
No, I... I'll be fine.

13:47.199 --> 13:49.441
How long can you go
without drinking?

13:49.476 --> 13:53.608
I don't know.
What's the record?

13:59.760 --> 14:02.648
That man. That...

14:02.683 --> 14:04.816
- That man.
- What about him?

14:04.851 --> 14:07.312
He's wearing my clothes.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.960
I think he stole my suitcases.
Excuse me.

14:10.995 --> 14:13.048
What are you doing?
Hello? Excuse me?

14:13.083 --> 14:18.249
Sir? Sir? Hello?
Excuse me.! Excuse me?

14:18.284 --> 14:22.379
Oh, sir? Excuse me.
Hey, senor.!

14:22.414 --> 14:25.864
I'd like to talk to you!

14:25.899 --> 14:29.048
Sir? Sir?
Con permiso?

14:29.083 --> 14:31.411
Stop.! Senor, wait.!

14:34.421 --> 14:39.090
Stop! Stop!
Alto.!

14:46.156 --> 14:48.881
Adrian.!
Adrian, are you okay?

14:48.916 --> 14:50.500
Oh, my God!
He could have killed you!

14:50.535 --> 14:53.468
I think that was the idea.

15:00.046 --> 15:02.461
My goodness, senor Monk.
You are lucky to be alive.

15:02.496 --> 15:04.726
Did you get the license number
of the truck? - No.

15:04.761 --> 15:08.185
He was probably drunk.
He lost control of the vehicle.

15:08.220 --> 15:10.262
He wasn't drunk! He tried to kill him.

15:10.297 --> 15:13.598
Why would anyone in San Macros
want to hurt senor Monk?

15:13.633 --> 15:17.686
- Do you have any enemies here?
- No, not here.

15:17.721 --> 15:20.351
So, I am right... a drunk driver.

15:20.386 --> 15:23.078
- Or maybe it was the drugs.
- We'll find him.

15:23.113 --> 15:27.178
Oh, senor Monk, Dr. Madero, our local
coroner. - Bienvenidos.!

15:27.213 --> 15:30.667
This is a great honor, senor Monk.
You are legendary,

15:30.702 --> 15:33.934
even in this tiny corner of the world.

15:33.969 --> 15:36.831
I know. It is a frightful smell.

15:36.866 --> 15:39.498
Here... mentholated cream.

15:39.533 --> 15:43.134
Put a little bit under your nose.
You'll be fine.

15:43.962 --> 15:49.223
- Is that better?
- Si. Gracias.

15:49.258 --> 15:51.630
You want some?

15:51.665 --> 15:54.971
Doctor, senor Monk is helping
with the Chip Rosatti case.

15:55.006 --> 15:56.617
Ah, excelente.

15:56.652 --> 15:58.875
- He wanted to see your report.
- Of course.

15:58.910 --> 16:02.744
Anything you need. You know,
I just love it when Americans visit.

16:02.779 --> 16:07.006
I've never been to the United States.
It's been my life's dream.

16:07.041 --> 16:10.033
- Here it is.
- Uh, thank you.

16:13.318 --> 16:17.300
"Catastrophic injuries,
both internal and external."

16:17.335 --> 16:22.365
Consistent with a fall from a great height.
Plus his blood was hypertonic...

16:22.400 --> 16:26.579
and there was a pint of water in each lung.
In other words, he drowned

16:26.614 --> 16:28.104
- Was he drugged?
- Oh, no, no.

16:28.139 --> 16:31.889
No drugs, no alcohol,
no signs of force.

16:31.924 --> 16:35.606
- Time of death?
- There was zero lividity.

16:35.641 --> 16:39.691
No rigor mortis.
He died just before impact.

16:39.726 --> 16:41.937
This case is even stranger
than the one last year.

16:41.972 --> 16:45.466
- Oh, what happened last year?
- Another unusual death.

16:45.501 --> 16:49.066
An American student
was mauled by a wild lion.

16:49.101 --> 16:52.497
- A wild lion?
- What, did he escape from the circus?

16:52.532 --> 16:54.833
That was the puzzle.
There was no circus.

16:54.868 --> 16:57.093
A wild lion in Mexico?

16:57.128 --> 17:00.426
It was definitely a lion.
I did the autopsy myself.

17:00.461 --> 17:04.579
It was drug-related, somehow.
I am sure of it. - I am sure you're right.

17:04.614 --> 17:06.883
I wish you had been here
for that case, senor Monk.

17:06.917 --> 17:08.960
All right, let's forget about the lion.
The lion is ancient history.

17:08.994 --> 17:12.422
It's old news. - Yes. Let's concentrate
on the case at hand.

17:12.457 --> 17:17.089
He jumped from an airplane and drowned.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.771
- Are you all right?
- Uh, I'm just a little thirsty.

17:20.807 --> 17:25.310
- Do you have any bottled water?
- Oh, yes. I have Perrier.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.490
No, thank you. I'm fine.

17:35.115 --> 17:37.949
Here.

17:37.984 --> 17:40.117
- No, thank you.
- It's fine. It's in a can.

17:40.152 --> 17:42.006
It doesn't say
where it was bottled.

17:42.041 --> 17:45.549
I'm Captain Valez.
You wanted to see me?

17:45.584 --> 17:49.043
Uh, yeah. I'm Sharona Fleming
and this is Adrian Monk.

17:49.078 --> 17:51.763
We're investigating the death
of Chip Rosatti.

17:51.798 --> 17:54.168
Well, I wish you luck.

17:54.203 --> 17:59.149
The police have shut me down
until they figure out what happened.

17:59.184 --> 18:02.767
Well, we understand you were
the last person to see Chip alive.

18:02.802 --> 18:06.515
The police think I was involved,
which is crazy.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.073
Why would I do this to my own business?

18:08.108 --> 18:10.528
Why don't you tell us what happened?

18:10.563 --> 18:13.739
The kid, Rosatti, showed up
with a letter from the home office...

18:13.774 --> 18:16.627
that said, "Good for one
complimentary jump."

18:16.662 --> 18:19.164
It turned out to be a forgery,

18:19.199 --> 18:22.747
but at the time it looked,
how do you say, "kosher".

18:22.782 --> 18:25.912
So I took him up, I strapped him in,
and he jumped. That's all I know.

18:25.947 --> 18:30.617
Captain, the rip cord on
the boy's parachute was severed.

18:30.652 --> 18:34.324
- So they tell me.
- Who had access to the parachute?

18:34.359 --> 18:37.936
Everyone, anyone. It was sitting
right here on this shelf all weekend.

18:37.971 --> 18:42.590
Anyone could have cut it.
From now on, I check them all.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.641
I feel terrible.

18:44.676 --> 18:47.821
- Is this the plane?
- Si.

18:48.787 --> 18:51.748
Did anything unusual happen
during the flight?

18:51.783 --> 18:53.106
No, it was routine.

18:53.141 --> 18:56.680
I've logged over
a thousand flights just like it.

18:56.715 --> 18:58.939
So Chip was alive
when you took off?

18:58.974 --> 19:02.171
Everybody saw him.
Talk to my crew.

19:02.206 --> 19:03.983
He was alive when he jumped.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.842
I don't know what happened
after he left the plane.

19:06.877 --> 19:08.621
Why don't you talk to
his three little friends?

19:08.656 --> 19:10.364
Three? I thought there were two.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.645
Two came to watch, but there
was a third kid who dropped him off.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.091
- A third kid?
- An American.

19:16.126 --> 19:20.625
- Did you get a name?
- I think his name was T. J.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.056
- I saw Chip give him something.
- What was it?

19:23.091 --> 19:25.894
I don't know.
This kid, T. J.,

19:25.929 --> 19:29.678
he was wearing a Rolex watch
and driving a very nice car.

19:29.713 --> 19:31.951
You might want to check
the Grande Lago Resort.

19:31.986 --> 19:34.541
That's where all the rich kids stay.

19:39.536 --> 19:44.016
- Oh, excuse me. We're looking for a T. J.
- Good luck.

19:46.025 --> 19:49.570
I've never been prouder to be an American.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.740
- They're having fun.
- So this is fun?

19:52.775 --> 19:55.164
I've heard about fun.
I've never been this close to it.

19:55.199 --> 20:00.007
Hey, you're hot.
You wanna, you know, go upstairs?

20:00.042 --> 20:02.470
I'd rather chew glass.

20:04.226 --> 20:07.205
You hear that? Did you hear
what she just said to me?

20:14.088 --> 20:16.316
Excuse me.

20:16.351 --> 20:20.666
- Where'd you get that water?
- I brought it with me from San Diego.

20:20.701 --> 20:24.369
- We'll give you $20 for it.
- What?

20:24.404 --> 20:26.538
Look, it's the only brand that he likes...

20:26.573 --> 20:29.199
and he hasn't had anything to eat
or drink all day.

20:29.234 --> 20:33.307
- Well, here you go.
- Oh, thank you. - Yeah!

20:39.551 --> 20:42.324
- That's the most obnoxious thing
I've ever seen. - Yeah?

20:42.359 --> 20:45.842
Is it more obnoxious than this?

20:48.646 --> 20:50.207
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.

20:50.242 --> 20:52.884
Are you still looking for T. J.?
'Cause he's right over there.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.463
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

20:57.444 --> 20:59.668
Oh, my God.

20:59.703 --> 21:02.711
So you'd rather chew glass, huh?

21:03.440 --> 21:07.074
Hey, look. I'm sorry I said that.
It was just an expression.

21:07.109 --> 21:09.377
Oh, yeah? Well, I know
a few expressions too.

21:09.412 --> 21:13.583
We know that you drove Chip
to the airport on the day he died.

21:13.618 --> 21:17.734
I barely knew the kid, all right? I met him
that morning. He asked me for a ride.

21:17.769 --> 21:20.043
Why didn't you go to the police?

21:20.078 --> 21:23.717
Yeah, right. Like I'm gonna get involved
with the federales.

21:23.752 --> 21:27.654
The pilot said that Chip gave you something
just before they took off.

21:27.689 --> 21:30.441
Maybe he did.

21:30.476 --> 21:33.243
What... What was it?

21:33.278 --> 21:36.519
I told you.
I am not gonna get involved.

21:36.554 --> 21:42.627
Did you hear what he said?
We're with the police. Somebody is dead.

21:42.662 --> 21:45.664
I'll tell you what.
I'll drink you for it.

21:45.699 --> 21:48.876
Me and my buddy against the two of you.
One pitcher each.

21:48.911 --> 21:51.620
If you finish first,
I'll tell you what I know.

21:51.655 --> 21:54.201
- Fine. You're on.
- No. What? No.

21:54.236 --> 21:56.872
This is insane.
No, forget it.

21:56.907 --> 21:58.871
We'll just call Captain Alameda.

21:58.906 --> 22:02.587
- It's a piece of cake.
- Sharona, I don't drink.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.609
Don't worry about it. I do.

22:05.644 --> 22:09.600
Ready! Set! Go!

22:11.868 --> 22:13.812
Come on!

22:18.329 --> 22:20.198
What are you doing?
It's a race!

22:20.233 --> 22:22.373
One second.
You'll thank me later.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.331
Give it to me.
Give it to me!

22:24.366 --> 22:26.508
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

22:26.543 --> 22:29.063
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

22:29.098 --> 22:31.744
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

22:31.779 --> 22:38.658
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

22:49.599 --> 22:52.193
Four years
of Catholic high school!

22:52.228 --> 22:53.932
Fork it over.

22:53.967 --> 22:57.394
- Okay. Here.
- A key?

22:57.429 --> 22:59.438
- What's it for?
- I don't know.

22:59.473 --> 23:04.489
He just asked me
to hold onto it for him.

23:04.524 --> 23:07.374
Adrian, why don't you
go back to the hotel.

23:07.409 --> 23:11.114
Vacuum or something.
I'll stay here for a while.

23:11.149 --> 23:14.369
- Want to do another one?
- Let's do it. - All right.

23:45.849 --> 23:49.070
- Hey, Detective!
- Where have you been?

23:49.105 --> 23:51.479
Are you okay?

23:52.815 --> 23:56.953
- Did you... have fun?
- I had fun.

23:56.988 --> 24:02.241
I forgot how much fun fun was.
I like it here.

24:02.276 --> 24:05.949
- Where did you get that necklace?
- I don't remember.

24:05.984 --> 24:10.088
Don't ask me anything else.
It hurts to think.

24:10.123 --> 24:12.710
But-But that-that's my bed.

24:12.745 --> 24:17.514
- Your bed is in the next room.
- Oh, shut up!

24:18.770 --> 24:22.218
I've been asking around
about the key.

24:22.253 --> 24:25.869
The concierge says it might fit
a locker at the bus station.

24:25.904 --> 24:28.778
- You want to go check it out with me?
- You mean now?

24:28.813 --> 24:33.112
I'm afraid they're gonna clean out the
locker. We'll lose whatever's in there.

24:33.147 --> 24:36.829
I think what I'd rather do...

24:36.864 --> 24:40.196
is die.

24:40.231 --> 24:44.889
Okay.
So I'll just go out alone then.

24:48.202 --> 24:52.338
Without you.

24:52.373 --> 24:54.420
By myself.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.335
Senorita Fleming.
Are you all right?

25:41.370 --> 25:43.191
Do you have any aspirin?

25:43.226 --> 25:50.705
- Yes. Uh, how many do you need?
- A thousand

25:50.740 --> 25:55.845
- I like your necklace.
- Senorita.

25:58.110 --> 26:02.423
Sharona.
Something has happened.

26:02.458 --> 26:05.628
- What?
- It is your friend, senor Monk.

26:05.663 --> 26:07.712
Was he at the bus station
last night?

26:07.747 --> 26:11.569
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
Why?

26:12.791 --> 26:15.917
Oh, my God.
What happened?

26:15.952 --> 26:17.896
I'm terribly sorry.

26:20.320 --> 26:24.062
Senor Monk, he is dead.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.518
What?

26:33.525 --> 26:36.397
Well, Judge Dexter won't give us
the warrant.

26:36.432 --> 26:40.515
Yeah. I knew she was trouble
when they appointed her.

26:40.550 --> 26:46.084
Stottlemeyer. Yes, Captain?
Yeah, I know him very well.

26:46.119 --> 26:47.904
What's he done now?

26:53.126 --> 26:58.523
Uh, thank you.
L-I have to hang up now.

26:58.558 --> 27:01.437
Captain?

27:02.512 --> 27:09.643
That was Captain Alameda,
San Macros Police Department.

27:09.678 --> 27:11.809
Adrian Monk is dead.

27:11.844 --> 27:14.098
He never used the same umbrella twice.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.898
Every time it rained, he threw it out.
It drove me crazy.

27:16.933 --> 27:18.594
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without him.

27:18.629 --> 27:21.920
Senorita, you have to come down
and identify the body.

27:21.955 --> 27:26.340
I will go with you. If it's any consolation,
your friend showed great courage.

27:26.375 --> 27:29.913
After he was run over,
he crawled inch by inch...

27:29.948 --> 27:33.302
through the mud and garbage
trying to get help.

27:33.337 --> 27:38.870
- He crawled through what?
- Mud and garbage.

27:38.905 --> 27:40.433
He's not dead.

27:40.468 --> 27:42.845
- Pardon me?
- It's not him!

27:42.880 --> 27:45.754
- Senorita, your friend is gone.
- It's not him.

27:45.789 --> 27:49.139
Maybe it's the guy that stole our
suitcases? - How can you be sure?

27:49.174 --> 27:52.260
Adrian Monk would die before he'd crawl
through mud and garbage.

27:52.295 --> 27:56.118
- But he was dying.
- You don't understand.

27:56.153 --> 27:58.115
Adrian!
Senor Monk.!

27:58.150 --> 28:01.981
That officer outside
told me I was dead.

28:02.016 --> 28:06.075
I'm not dead, am I?

28:06.110 --> 28:08.489
You're not dead.

28:08.524 --> 28:10.296
I didn't think so.

28:10.331 --> 28:13.415
I am so thirsty.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.918
I found this in the locker.

28:15.953 --> 28:18.281
It's Chip Rosatti's.

28:21.785 --> 28:24.453
I'm so thirsty.

28:24.488 --> 28:27.014
In a way, given what
he had to deal with,

28:27.049 --> 28:30.902
he was the bravest man I've ever known.

28:30.937 --> 28:32.979
I measured everything I did
against him.

28:33.014 --> 28:37.347
He was my yardstick.
I never told him that.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.572
I'm sure he knew, sir.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.740
I'm sure he did.

28:42.775 --> 28:45.451
The son of a bitch knew everything.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.262
I want a full-dress funeral.
I want the governor there.

28:51.297 --> 28:56.786
I want the entire department there
with black armbands and white gloves.

28:56.821 --> 29:00.958
Sir, Monk wasn't on active duty.
We can't go full dress.

29:00.993 --> 29:05.451
Adrian Monk is to be buried
with honors or I quit.

29:05.486 --> 29:08.988
I'm gonna tell you something, Randy,
and I'm not ashamed to admit this...

29:09.023 --> 29:10.666
I loved that man.

29:13.069 --> 29:17.242
This is Stottlemeyer.
Yes.

29:17.277 --> 29:20.041
I understand.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.104
I hate that man.

29:31.028 --> 29:33.955
I hate that man!

29:35.287 --> 29:36.834
Thank you for coming, senor Monk.

29:36.869 --> 29:40.004
As you can see,
there is nothing unusual here.

29:40.039 --> 29:44.550
Some skin cream, a T-shirt,
some magazines,

29:44.585 --> 29:47.882
and, oh, yes, a candy bar.

29:49.234 --> 29:51.520
- No drugs?
- No, senor.

29:51.555 --> 29:53.549
Which makes me think...

29:53.584 --> 29:57.329
for once we have a case
that may not involve drugs.

29:57.364 --> 30:00.077
- I have a theory.
- What is it?

30:00.112 --> 30:06.331
The boy, Chip Rosatti, drowned at the
resort...in the swimming pool.

30:06.366 --> 30:09.751
It was an accident.
The resort owner panicked.

30:09.786 --> 30:13.208
He couldn't afford all
the bad publicity or a lawsuit.

30:13.243 --> 30:16.414
So, to cover up, he arranged for the boy's
body to be put on an airplane...

30:16.449 --> 30:18.708
and made it look like
a parachuting accident.

30:18.743 --> 30:21.963
But his friends talked to him
just before he jumped.

30:21.998 --> 30:23.877
They were obviously paid off.

30:23.912 --> 30:26.259
But the pilot swore
he was alive.

30:26.294 --> 30:28.371
Then he was paid off as well.

30:28.406 --> 30:32.052
What do you think, Mr. Monk?

30:32.087 --> 30:35.682
I'm... I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

30:35.717 --> 30:37.825
Capitan,
I have some excellent news.

30:37.860 --> 30:41.098
Don't tell me you have the news.
Tell me the news.

30:41.133 --> 30:44.704
- He's here.
- Excellent!

30:44.739 --> 30:48.085
Oh. The hotel owner is here.
He will be in the next room.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.077
You will have the front row seat.

30:50.112 --> 30:53.894
He will be confessing very shortly.

30:59.306 --> 31:01.886
Can we get you anything, Hernandez?

31:01.921 --> 31:05.216
- It is a bit hot in here, Capitan.
- Of course.!

31:05.251 --> 31:10.065
Sergeant, get some water
for our guest.

31:10.100 --> 31:13.974
Hernandez, we know all about the
accident in the swimming pool.

31:14.009 --> 31:16.099
- What accident?
- Don't play games.

31:16.134 --> 31:19.311
We know Chip Rosatti drowned there
and you tried to cover it up.

31:19.346 --> 31:23.496
You're crazy.
Is that why you brought me here?

31:28.421 --> 31:31.517
Sierra Springs?

31:31.552 --> 31:35.877
- Sergeant, is there any more Sierra
Springs? - Sorry, no mas.

31:35.912 --> 31:39.779
That was the last one. We have Perrier.

31:39.814 --> 31:44.503
- I like your beads.
- Thanks.

31:47.181 --> 31:51.509
- What was that?
- Don't change the subject!

31:51.544 --> 31:53.086
Do you have witnesses?

31:53.121 --> 31:54.684
If he drowned, there
must have been a witness.

31:54.719 --> 31:56.908
Maybe you paid them off
like you paid off the pilot.

31:56.943 --> 32:00.686
- Adrian! Adrian! Look at this!
- What is it?

32:00.721 --> 32:04.761
Hydroxyzine. That means
he was allergic to chlorine.

32:04.796 --> 32:08.774
- He never would have gone swimming.
- I don't care.

32:08.809 --> 32:12.601
I'm just so damn thirsty.

32:53.583 --> 32:56.196
If Chip didn't drown in the pool, something
must have happened on the plane.

32:56.231 --> 32:59.075
- Maybe.
- I think we should go back to the airport.

32:59.110 --> 33:02.253
- Okay.
- I'm gonna call Benjy.

33:10.547 --> 33:13.924
Hi, honey, it's me.
How you doing?

33:13.959 --> 33:16.372
You did?

33:16.407 --> 33:19.227
That's... I am so proud of you.

33:19.262 --> 33:22.142
You wanna tell him about it?
Okay, okay. One sec, okay? I love you.

33:22.177 --> 33:23.919
I love you too. Bye.

33:23.954 --> 33:27.704
- Adrian, he wants to talk to you.
- But the painting...

33:27.739 --> 33:31.052
I'll fix the painting. Come on.
He wants to talk to you.

33:35.231 --> 33:38.033
Hi, Benjy.
It's me, Monk.

33:38.068 --> 33:44.387
What are you drinking?
Oh, I thought you were drinking something.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.629
Hold please.
Sharona, the bed.

33:48.664 --> 33:51.618
- It's not made.!
- So?

33:51.653 --> 33:54.508
The maid hasn't been in here.

33:54.543 --> 33:58.781
Don't move!
Benjy, we'll call you back.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.362
Don't move.

34:04.348 --> 34:08.322
- Somebody's been in this room.
- How do you know?

34:08.357 --> 34:12.014
The three-way lamp...it was on "low"
when we left, but now it's on "high".

34:12.050 --> 34:16.777
And that painting was tilted the other way.

34:33.047 --> 34:36.909
Senor Monk?
Senor Monk?

34:36.944 --> 34:39.135
Senor Monk?

34:39.170 --> 34:42.235
- There you are.
- Are you all right? - Yeah?

34:42.271 --> 34:45.513
You are a brave man, senor Monk.
You are not sweating at all.

34:45.547 --> 34:48.976
I'm dehydrated. I'm out of sweat.
I want to sweat. I'm trying to sweat.

34:49.011 --> 34:52.188
Clearly, you were right, senor.
Somebody is trying to kill you.

34:52.223 --> 34:56.033
You must be frightening someone.
But we don't even have a suspect.

34:56.068 --> 34:59.995
This isn't about the Chip Rosatti case.
It's about something else.

35:00.030 --> 35:02.855
- What?
- I don't know.

35:02.890 --> 35:07.349
Maybe it's just a local zafado
who hates people from San Francisco.

35:07.974 --> 35:09.993
Excuse me?

35:10.028 --> 35:13.807
He's right. You, Chip Rosatti, the boy last
year who was mauled by the wild lion...

35:13.842 --> 35:15.470
you are all from San Francisco.

35:15.505 --> 35:17.605
The boy who was mauled
is from San Francisco?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.969
Yes, from Marin County.
From a wealthy family.

35:20.004 --> 35:22.413
And Chip Rosatti's family had money.

35:22.448 --> 35:23.312
- What?
- I got it!

35:23.347 --> 35:26.250
I know who did it, I know how and
I know why! - You do?

35:26.285 --> 35:29.265
Get the car! Start packing!
We're going home! - What?

35:29.300 --> 35:32.236
It's all over!
We're going home! - What?

35:32.271 --> 35:37.494
When did the coroner, Dr. Madero,
first arrive in San Macros?

35:37.529 --> 35:40.690
Wait. Don't tell me.
A year and a half ago.

35:40.725 --> 35:43.909
That's right! But what does Madero
have to do with all this?

35:43.944 --> 35:49.192
I didn't catch it before...
because I'm so damn thirsty.

35:49.227 --> 35:51.375
Smell this!

35:52.703 --> 35:53.587
Menthol.

35:53.622 --> 35:56.504
Madero uses mentholated cream
when he works at the morgue.

35:56.539 --> 36:00.340
Go find Dr. Madero
and bring him here! Rapido.!

36:00.375 --> 36:04.811
Plato! - Come on!
Come on. Pack! Pack!

36:04.846 --> 36:07.557
It's nothing personal.
I just... I just gotta go home.

36:07.592 --> 36:09.895
I still don't understand,
senor Monk.

36:09.930 --> 36:14.409
Captain, the wild lion last year
and the boy who drowned in midair,

36:14.444 --> 36:20.236
- what do they have in common?
- I don't know!

36:20.271 --> 36:24.433
They're both impossible.
One impossible murder, maybe.

36:24.468 --> 36:28.652
Two impossible murders?
It's just not possible.

36:29.539 --> 36:30.870
- Is the car downstairs?
- I just called.

36:30.905 --> 36:33.046
- Come on.
- Wait! Wait, wait! My hairbrush!

36:33.081 --> 36:35.419
- I'll buy you a new one!
- How are you so sure?

36:35.454 --> 36:37.048
Two years ago back in the States,

36:37.083 --> 36:39.423
I testified against a doctor
named Louis Nivara.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.306
I remember that case.
It was an insurance scam.

36:41.341 --> 36:43.439
It ruined him.
He lost his practice.

36:43.474 --> 36:46.359
His poor wife committed suicide,
and he always blamed me.

36:46.394 --> 36:48.434
So you think this Dr. Nivara...

36:48.469 --> 36:51.619
And your coroner, Dr. Madero...
one and the same.

36:51.654 --> 36:54.312
- But why didn't you recognize him?
- I never met the man.

36:54.347 --> 36:56.774
It was a grand jury.
Closed hearing.

36:56.809 --> 36:59.240
He jumped bail before the trial
and disappeared.

36:59.275 --> 37:00.623
Excuse me. Could we go first?

37:00.658 --> 37:03.482
I haven't had a thing to eat
or drink in 36 hours.

37:03.517 --> 37:05.782
- Hi. We're checking out!
- What room, senor?

37:05.817 --> 37:07.452
The room with the bomb
behind the painting.

37:07.487 --> 37:10.507
Oh, yes. Room 403.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.456
Speak of the devil.

37:14.332 --> 37:17.420
- Que pasa, Capitan?
- Dr. Nivara.

37:17.455 --> 37:19.462
I believe that's your real name.

37:19.497 --> 37:20.927
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:20.962 --> 37:23.293
I'm talking about homicide, Doctor.

37:23.328 --> 37:28.229
I was just explaining to the captain
why you killed Chip Rosatti.

37:30.945 --> 37:34.509
This whole thing has been about me
from the beginning, hasn't it?

37:34.544 --> 37:38.076
- About you?
- You wanted to kill me.

37:38.111 --> 37:41.992
You blame me for ruining
your life by testifying against you.

37:42.027 --> 37:45.523
But you couldn't return to the States.
You're a wanted man.

37:45.558 --> 37:49.504
So you had to find a way
to get me to come to you.

37:49.539 --> 37:52.200
- Senor, would you care to check the bill?
- No, it's fine.

37:52.235 --> 37:54.116
You needed the right bait.

37:54.151 --> 37:59.540
A kid from San Francisco whose family
had money and connections.

37:59.575 --> 38:02.788
If the murder was difficult enough
and mysterious enough,

38:02.823 --> 38:05.033
you knew the mayor
would bring me in.

38:05.068 --> 38:07.376
It's true.
He's the go-to guy.

38:07.411 --> 38:11.355
You went to the Grande Lago Resort
and you found Chip Rosatti.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.359
- He was a thirsty victim.
- Adrian.

38:13.394 --> 38:18.111
I mean, a perfect victim.
His family was rich and well connected.

38:18.146 --> 38:23.539
You sent him a letter with a coupon
for one free skydiving lesson.

38:23.574 --> 38:27.088
But first you made sure that
his parachute would never open.

38:27.123 --> 38:29.691
Shall we keep this on your card,
senor Monk? - Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

38:29.726 --> 38:33.496
- Shall I staple them together?
- I don't care! Do what you want!

38:33.531 --> 38:37.413
- Where is the car?
- It is coming. Continue, senor Monk.

38:37.448 --> 38:40.235
When Chip Rosatti's body
was brought in,

38:40.270 --> 38:42.707
the good doctor
poured water into his lungs...

38:42.742 --> 38:45.511
and announced that the boy
had mysteriously drowned.

38:45.546 --> 38:50.969
He knew the mayor often
asked me to look into cases like this.

38:51.004 --> 38:54.859
Capitan, you cannot believe
a word he's saying!

38:54.894 --> 38:57.837
Actually, Doctor,
it explains quite a bit.

38:57.872 --> 39:01.899
There were some fingerprints on the
parachute handles we couldn't match up.

39:01.934 --> 39:05.107
I'll be interested in comparing
them with yours.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.280
You're leaving too?

39:07.315 --> 39:10.525
I'm afraid your impression
of own town must be terrible.

39:10.560 --> 39:14.289
- Will you give us another chance?
- Oh, of course. I love your country.

39:14.324 --> 39:18.141
Maybe you come back alone.
You can earn some more necklaces.

39:18.176 --> 39:20.873
Why does everybody
keep mentioning my necklaces?

39:20.908 --> 39:25.058
They're fiesta beads.
Oh. What are fiesta beads?

39:25.093 --> 39:26.852
You don't remember how you got them?

39:26.887 --> 39:30.444
- No.
- Hey, guys give them to girls at parties.

39:30.479 --> 39:32.098
Oh, what for?

39:36.083 --> 39:39.067
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you tell me?

39:39.102 --> 39:41.700
You wore them so proudly.

39:41.735 --> 39:43.984
Oh, God! Adrian!

39:44.019 --> 39:48.249
- The car's here! Let's go!
- Senor Monk!

39:48.284 --> 39:51.162
You said you ruined my life.
That is wrong.

39:51.197 --> 39:54.528
You stole it!
I made one foolish mistake.

39:54.563 --> 39:56.028
Nobody even noticed.!

39:56.063 --> 40:01.451
Who the hell are you
to point your finger at me?

40:01.486 --> 40:05.278
- Who is he? - He is a police officer,
and a damn fine one!

40:05.313 --> 40:08.788
Keep your eye on him, Lieutenant.
He is the primary suspect in two homicides.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.435
Actually three. Three homicides.
Don't forget the boy the killed last year.

40:14.022 --> 40:16.262
- The wild lion?
- Exactly.

40:16.297 --> 40:20.155
He fabricated that too. Only it
didn't work, 'cause no one called me.

40:20.190 --> 40:22.955
So he waited a year and tried again.

40:24.627 --> 40:28.352
All this because you smelled
menthol cream on the curtains?

40:28.387 --> 40:31.531
Actually, I've been thinking
about Madero for a while.

40:31.566 --> 40:33.354
He claimed he had never been to
the United States.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.036
Then he said there
was a pint of water in the boy's lungs.

40:36.071 --> 40:38.750
He didn't say half a liter.
He said, "A pint."

40:38.785 --> 40:41.741
Only a person who practiced in the United
States would have said that.

40:41.776 --> 40:44.528
Senor Monk, I want to say,
it has been an honor...

40:44.563 --> 40:48.740
to work side by side with such an
accomplished detective. - Mail it to us!

41:00.046 --> 41:04.374
- Just put 'em anywhere.
- Thanks a lot.

41:04.991 --> 41:07.821
- I see you bought some water.
- Yeah.

41:11.529 --> 41:14.199
- What are you doing?
- I'm thirsty.

41:14.234 --> 41:17.468
No, no.
Don't-Don't-Don't drink that.

41:19.045 --> 41:21.946
- That's my emergency stash.
- You have like a thousand bottles here.

41:21.981 --> 41:26.138
5,040. Here.
Drink this.

41:26.173 --> 41:27.910
That's fresher.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.547
Hey! Oh, great.
No, great.

41:36.582 --> 41:39.733
Now I'm gonna have to
order some more.

41:40.852 --> 41:43.890
Hey, it's from San Macros.

41:43.925 --> 41:48.388
They indicted Dr. Madero.
There's a trial date.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.612
It's hard to believe.

41:49.647 --> 41:54.832
I never even met the guy in person
and he wanted to kill me, huh?

41:56.669 --> 42:02.229
I said, It's hard to believe.
I barely knew him and he wanted me dead.

42:03.372 --> 42:07.214
I mean, it's hard to believe,
don't you think?

42:07.794 --> 42:11.765
Sharona, he wanted me dead.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.855
Hello?

42:14.305 --> 42:20.383
