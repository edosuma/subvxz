00:17.517 --> 00:18.817
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Last Man on Earth...</i>

00:18.819 --> 00:19.952
Phil's been missing for about

00:19.954 --> 00:21.620
<i>24 hours.</i>
<i>(yelling)</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.022
This guy belong to you?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.957
Oh, my God.
That guy's handsome.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.459
I like you.
Yeah, but you don't love me.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.794
I'm Phil, Phil Miller.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.129
No, I'm Phil Miller.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.164
Maybe you should both go
by your middle names.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.866
Phil, what's your middle name?
Tandy.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.134
Tandy?
PHIL: <i>Carol?</i>

00:35.136 --> 00:36.869
Do you like this guy?
You jealous?

00:36.871 --> 00:37.970
Of course not.

00:37.972 --> 00:40.105
Good night... Tandy.

00:42.675 --> 00:44.710
PHIL 2 (laughing):
<i>Wow.</i>

00:44.712 --> 00:46.311
I'm blown away.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.014
So, why's it living up here now?

00:49.016 --> 00:50.549
(laughs)
Phil.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.151
So new, so naÃ¯ve.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.886
She wandered up here on her own.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.655
And any real cattleman knows
that a cow can't go down stairs.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.724
Shoot, you can make a cow do
just about anything

00:58.726 --> 01:01.060
if you show her who's boss.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.895
Hyah! Hyah! Get! Get! Get!

01:02.897 --> 01:03.862
(cow moos)

01:03.864 --> 01:04.863
(gasps)

01:04.865 --> 01:06.298
She's going down the stairs!

01:08.334 --> 01:09.201
What?
Wow!

01:09.203 --> 01:10.369
Well, all it takes
is a firm slap

01:10.371 --> 01:12.171
and an authoritative tone,
you can make

01:12.173 --> 01:13.705
a cow do whatever you want.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.908
Doesn't just work on cows, hon.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.042
(both laugh)

01:17.044 --> 01:18.577
Come on, let's go
after her.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.012
Okay.
Go ahead.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.880
Thank you so much, Phil.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.015
That was amazing.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.250
Oh, you're welcome.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.122
(under his breath):
Friggin' Phil.

01:32.725 --> 01:35.260
Friggin' Phil.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.900
What's all this?

01:41.902 --> 01:44.703
Oh, Phil built it for the cow.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.871
Isn't it nice?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.107
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
she loves it, you know.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.441
She provides milk
to us and in return,

01:49.443 --> 01:52.311
we thank her by locking
her up like Charles Manson.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.247
So, uh... how was
your little trip

01:55.249 --> 01:56.882
over to see Phil last night?

01:56.884 --> 02:00.252
Ooh! Someone's jealous!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.220
(laughs)
Carol, please.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.721
It's me-- the Tandyman.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.089
I'm not the jealous type.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.624
(laughs)
Admit it!

02:05.626 --> 02:07.226
You're afraid
that the new buck in town

02:07.228 --> 02:09.261
is gonna spray
all over your turf.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.063
(scoffs)
Carol, look around you!

02:11.065 --> 02:13.232
Every inch of this place
is already covered

02:13.234 --> 02:16.068
in layers and layers
of Tandy Miller spray.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.736
You see it, I've doused it.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.404
And he knows that.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.907
Well, I think Phil's gonna be
a very positive addition

02:21.909 --> 02:23.742
to our community.
Eh...

02:23.744 --> 02:25.944
He said he's even gonna clean
out the garbage pool.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.147
So, what-- then we just
have an empty pool?

02:28.149 --> 02:30.149
Where we gonna put
all our garbage?

02:30.151 --> 02:31.583
I'm sure he has a plan.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.085
Why don't you ask him?

02:33.087 --> 02:35.254
Maybe I'll do that.
Where is he?

02:35.256 --> 02:37.256
He's over at Frick
and Frack's house.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.925
They asked him to help fix
their broken generator.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.827
(sputters)
Oldest trick in the book.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.531
Maybe I ought to go lend a hand
on fixing that generator.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.433
(beeping)

02:48.435 --> 02:50.802
Yeah, I can't find
anything wrong with this thing.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.671
It seems to be
working just fine.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.106
Well, that's weird,

02:54.108 --> 02:56.975
because it was
making this horrible,

02:56.977 --> 02:58.343
horrible sound.
Yeah.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.978
It was like hong...
Clang.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.780
Hong clang, hong clang.
Hong clang, yeah.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.615
Just a real gumbo of sounds.
CAROL: Hello!

03:03.617 --> 03:06.018
Did someone call
for a generator repair backup?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.487
Because the Tandyman is
in the hizzy.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.621
In the house.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.824
No need, Tandy.
Phil already fixed it.

03:12.826 --> 03:13.992
I didn't do anything.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.295
Great. Well, let me just
double-check his work.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.664
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.165
Hey, Carol.
Oh, hi.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.466
Thanks so much for the pie.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.801
Oh.
(laughs)
You know, I haven't had

03:22.803 --> 03:23.969
fresh food in two years.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.304
Oh, you know, if it's

03:25.306 --> 03:26.838
food you're after,
I can make you

03:26.840 --> 03:28.674
a real home-cooked meal.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.509
'Cause I used to be a chef.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.543
Oh, wow.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.045
But nothing too fancy.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.479
I'm a simple guy.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.548
Oh, I am...
I'm a simple girl.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.317
So we have that in common.
Yeah.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.052
Not as simple as me, though.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.720
They used to call
me Simple Gail.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.554
Oh.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.389
Don't sell yourself
short, Gail.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.225
You're an incredibly
complex woman.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.060
No, no. I'm not.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.494
So, Phil...

03:49.496 --> 03:51.663
Uh, so where you gonna live?

03:51.665 --> 03:52.831
I don't know. I...

03:52.833 --> 03:56.034
Well, you know, uh,
this cul-de-sac's pretty full,

03:56.036 --> 03:58.837
but there are a lot of great
houses on the outskirts of town.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.073
Phoenix is beautiful, too.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.341
Oh, nonsense!
You could just stay here.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.909
We have plenty of room here.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.177
So, so much room.

04:05.179 --> 04:06.211
You should move in with us.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.380
Well...
You know, now that you got

04:08.382 --> 04:10.182
the goll-dang cow
out of my house,

04:10.184 --> 04:11.917
I'm all alone... and divorced.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.186
So I have plenty of room.

04:14.188 --> 04:15.187
Yeah, um...

04:15.189 --> 04:16.255
Got yourself a real

04:16.257 --> 04:17.689
Sophie's Choice here, Phil.

04:17.691 --> 04:21.226
But I got a housing option
that might just help you, huh?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.894
Bro it the hell out!

04:22.896 --> 04:24.529
Move in with me, huh?

04:24.531 --> 04:26.365
A little bachelor pad action.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.733
We got the weight bench.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.867
We can spot each other.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.535
Well, uh, let me, um...
(clears his throat)

04:30.537 --> 04:32.037
Don't you want to be my friend?

04:32.039 --> 04:35.774
Come on, choose this Sophie.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.745
Sure, yeah. Let's do it.
Hmm?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.046
Yeah, do it, yeah.
Uh...

04:41.048 --> 04:42.748
(laughs)
Okay.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.083
Ah... yeah.
Yeah!

04:45.085 --> 04:47.452
Great.
Thanks, ladies.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.089
Broken generator.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.358
(scoffs)
Nice try.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.800
What's all this?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.771
Hey!

05:05.773 --> 05:07.906
Hey! Look at this, huh?

05:07.908 --> 05:10.909
You got a class B commercial
license to operate this thing?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.110
I do.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.313
I-I was just kidding, but...

05:14.315 --> 05:15.614
good for you.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.083
I picked this up to handle
the garbage pool situation.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.085
You-you need any help or...?

05:20.087 --> 05:21.153
Nah, we're good.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.421
"We"?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.655
Take it easy, Tom.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.756
It's Todd.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.924
All right, Tom.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.626
It's Todd!
(Melissa whoops)

05:27.628 --> 05:29.261
Faster!

05:29.263 --> 05:31.096
Hey, Todd!

05:31.098 --> 05:32.698
(Melissa whoops)

05:34.100 --> 05:36.335
Frickin' Phil.

05:39.605 --> 05:40.605
There you are.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.606
Tandy.
Hey.

05:41.608 --> 05:45.177
Trust you've had a chance
to take a look around, huh?

05:45.179 --> 05:47.446
I did. Yeah.
To... Good, good.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.847
Obviously, <i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:52.117
Uh, if you ever want
to have any guests over,

05:52.119 --> 05:53.652
just run it by me--
standard stuff.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.787
Anyway, toilet paper's
under the sink.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.622
Got about a million toothbrushes
under there, too.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.957
All different sizes.
Uh-huh.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.859
I'm a large to extra-large.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.960
Wait, what the heck is that?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.628
Oh, you know, riding around
in the garbage truck

06:03.630 --> 06:05.464
sort of inspired me
to build this.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.965
Oh.
The flash heater

06:06.967 --> 06:08.633
connects to the water reservoir.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.469
I jacked up the water pressure.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.171
Basically, it feels
like a shower.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.306
Oh.
(laughs)

06:14.308 --> 06:15.974
Good for you.
All right.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.710
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take a shower.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.715
(funky music playing)

06:29.389 --> 06:32.557
(clears his throat)

06:35.061 --> 06:36.395
Can you excuse me?

06:36.397 --> 06:38.163
I'm gonna jump
in the shower now.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.831
Right now.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.900
Oh, yeah. Of course.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.338
You okay?

06:46.340 --> 06:48.106
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.679
(grunting)
(rock song playing)

06:54.681 --> 06:57.716
Five... six!
(easy listening song playing)

06:57.718 --> 06:59.050
All right.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.186
So, hey, what do you guys think?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.521
Huh? And be honest.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.022
This is a good body, right?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.691
I mean, I don't have
that weird V thing that he does

07:06.693 --> 07:09.194
that kind of points your eyes
down to your business.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.029
But these snakes can bite, huh?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.431
Oh, speaking of snakes...

07:12.433 --> 07:14.900
what do you think
of this bad boy?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.568
Huh? It's fine, right?

07:16.570 --> 07:19.037
I know it's not gonna win
any penis awards.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.105
But there aren't penis awards.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.873
So, whatever, you know?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.109
And the thing is,
as with many Ferraris,

07:24.111 --> 07:27.112
the real show is
on the back end.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.914
Not bad, huh?

07:28.916 --> 07:31.082
Hey, who does this guy
think he is, huh?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.584
He's taken my name.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.119
He's stealing all my chores.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.388
And-and now,
just stripping down

07:36.390 --> 07:38.390
in front of me,
in my own house?

07:38.392 --> 07:39.758
He's trying
to establish dominance.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.060
That's a statement move
right there.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.230
And I have to respond in kind.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.566
(whispering):
You got this! You look good!
You got a fine bod!

07:47.568 --> 07:50.068
You can do this!
You can do this!

07:50.070 --> 07:52.137
Ha!

07:54.574 --> 07:56.475
Phil...

07:57.643 --> 08:00.078
What are you doing, Tandy?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.747
Ah, you know, uh, just going
about my customary business

08:02.749 --> 08:04.416
in my own house.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.084
Huh, why don't you go
put some clothes on?

08:06.086 --> 08:09.087
(scoffs) Well, isn't that the
pot calling the kettle black...

08:09.089 --> 08:10.489
Or, uh... African-American.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.957
Or, uh... American.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.259
What are you trying to say?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.761
(laughs) Well, you took off
your shirt yesterday.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.097
And now suddenly being
shirtless is a crime?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.665
I was about to take a shower.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.100
Well, I was about to
take a shower, too.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.435
That's what I came to tell you.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.469
So, we're even.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.171
Well, now-now I know.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.105
Now you know.

08:27.107 --> 08:27.973
Now I know.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.474
Now you know! Ha!

08:29.476 --> 08:30.609
ERICA:
Hey, guys!

08:30.611 --> 08:32.110
Hey... Oh, my God!

08:32.112 --> 08:33.111
(laughs)

08:33.113 --> 08:34.279
Erica, g'day!

08:34.281 --> 08:35.447
G'day!

08:35.449 --> 08:36.648
I'm sorry, if I'd known
you were coming,

08:36.650 --> 08:37.816
I would've tucked it in.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.818
Oh, I kind of thought
you already did.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.653
(laughs)
As if.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.455
I know you didn't think that.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.290
But I love that
old Australian sass.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.358
Well...

08:46.360 --> 08:48.293
uh, I will get out of your hair.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.161
And your bald head, uh...

08:50.163 --> 08:52.163
Oh, look! The U.S. Constitution.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.331
Been meaning to frame that.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.166
We the people!
(laughs)

08:55.168 --> 08:57.702
(knocking on door)

08:59.805 --> 09:01.540
Hey.
Hey.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.809
You have a good time
with the garbage man?

09:04.811 --> 09:06.311
(clicks tongue)
Todd, come on.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.179
Oh, what?
It's a simple question.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.881
Riding on the back
of that truck,

09:09.883 --> 09:11.650
wind in your hair,
hooting and hollering.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.518
Looked like you were
having a great time.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.820
I was just helping Phil.
Oh, yeah?

09:15.822 --> 09:18.390
And I've always wanted to ride
on the back of a garbage truck.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.659
Don't...

09:20.661 --> 09:22.861
hang out with him.

09:22.863 --> 09:23.862
What?!

09:23.864 --> 09:26.164
If this relationship
is gonna work,

09:26.166 --> 09:29.034
you can't hang out with him.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.169
I...

09:31.171 --> 09:33.171
I forbid it.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.907
Todd, this has got to stop.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.076
Look, I've had a really nice
time with you and I...

09:38.078 --> 09:39.344
Whoa! You know what?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.212
I know how that sentence
is gonna end.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.214
And I'll beat you to it.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.382
We're done, Melissa.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.585
I dump you, okay?

09:46.587 --> 09:49.020
That's not what I was
going to say.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.389
But... fine.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.091
Bye, Todd.
No, wait! What...?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.859
What were you gonna say?

09:54.861 --> 09:57.195
What were
you gonna say?!

09:57.197 --> 09:59.230
<i>(Phil 2 grunting)</i>

09:59.232 --> 10:00.231
ERICA:
Almost.
PHIL 2: Come on!

10:00.233 --> 10:02.534
Almost.
Yup, right there!

10:02.536 --> 10:04.102
Knock, knock?
(chuckles)

10:04.104 --> 10:05.270
Hey.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.605
What's going on here?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.907
Phil and I are just trying
to get this icemaker working.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.709
Well...

10:10.711 --> 10:13.545
I don't mean to interrupt.
I just wanted to bring you

10:13.547 --> 10:15.280
these hush puppies I made you.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.215
Simple food.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.583
Much appreciated.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.418
See, it's funny
how sweaty you can get

10:20.420 --> 10:22.921
working on an <i>ice</i> machine.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.289
(all laughing)

10:24.291 --> 10:25.957
That's funny.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.394
Yeah, well,

10:29.396 --> 10:30.729
if you ladies will excuse me,

10:30.731 --> 10:32.297
I'm gonna go take a hot shower.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.398
CAROL:
What?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.300
You figured out
how to get hot showers?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.768
I sure did.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.903
Y'all are welcome to use it
anytime you want to.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.239
Well, I might just
take you up on that offer

10:41.241 --> 10:44.743
'cause I am very, very dirty.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.911
Okay. Yeah, sure.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.447
What's, what's that, Carol?

10:49.449 --> 10:53.752
Oh, just a dumb
scarf I made you.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.920
It gets drafty in this house.

10:55.922 --> 10:56.788
For me?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.590
Let me see--
that's not dumb.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.492
It's beautiful,
look at that.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.627
What a set of
crafty hands you got.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.928
(chuckles)

11:03.930 --> 11:04.929
Wow.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.599
Speaking of crafty hands,
what's that there?

11:07.601 --> 11:09.100
Are those little
kitties?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.268
Yeah.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.670
I'm a cat man, myself.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.772
Love cats.
So cute.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.606
Yeah.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.107
(clears throat)

11:16.109 --> 11:17.909
Thanks for the scarf.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.348
Well played, Carol.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.083
Well played.

11:26.952 --> 11:30.455
So now I see that exposing
my genitals to Phil

11:30.457 --> 11:32.123
was just a massive misfire.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.958
Well, how could you
have known?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.327
So, uh, what'd you want
to talk to me about, bud?

11:36.329 --> 11:38.530
Oh, nothing, other than
blowing the best thing

11:38.532 --> 11:39.798
that ever
happened to me.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.133
Melissa and I broke up
less than three hours ago,

11:42.135 --> 11:44.302
and I'm already in
a kind of free fall.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.004
Don't know where
the bottom is,

11:46.006 --> 11:47.505
huh?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.040
Hey, Todd, hey, hey.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.043
Don't put this on yourself.
This is all Phil's fault, okay?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.145
You're good,
you're fine, all right?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.313
Look at you.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.981
You look like a million bucks.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.216
Ah, thanks, man.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.219
Hey, do you think
I'm being paranoid,

12:01.221 --> 12:03.688
or do you think Phil really
wants to sleep with Melissa?

12:03.690 --> 12:05.790
Todd, don't worry.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.359
He definitely wants
to sleep with Melissa.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.494
And everyone else here.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.663
Hell, I'm not even sure
the cow's safe.

12:11.665 --> 12:14.099
And I'm sorry you had
to hear that, girl.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.302
He's a monster.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.072
Attention, everyone.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.875
Here's some trash talk
that I can get behind.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.211
The garbage pool is clean.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.413
Thanks to Phil.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.382
And that definitely
doesn't stink.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.517
(laughs)

12:32.519 --> 12:33.918
I see what you did there.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.853
Thank you.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.321
PHIL 2:
That was cute.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.727
Bravo.

12:42.729 --> 12:43.895
Thanks, Tandy.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.698
No, I really mean it.
I never questioned that.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.967
Good, 'cause it was
unquestionable.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.770
Do you have a problem with me?

12:51.772 --> 12:53.705
No, I don't.
'Cause it seems like you do.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.540
Well, maybe that's 'cause I do.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.075
What's your problem with me?

12:57.077 --> 13:00.245
Oh, you friggin' come in here
and try to impress everybody

13:00.247 --> 13:02.046
with all your skills
that pay the bills.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.882
But deep down,
you're jealous.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.950
Jellin' so hard right now.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.886
I got no beef with you, Tandy.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.289
That's President Tandy to you.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.258
Okay, I think we've had enough
of this president crap.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.094
Oh, so you think the American
system of government is crap.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.129
No, I think the fact that you
think you're president is crap.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.631
ERICA: And we didn't
even get to vote.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.899
It's not fair.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.901
TANDY: Yes, it is,
and even if it wasn't,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.602
none of you seem
to be interested

13:24.604 --> 13:25.904
in the responsibility.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.606
So unless any of you want
to get off your butts

13:28.608 --> 13:30.141
and throw your hats in the ring,

13:30.143 --> 13:32.243
looks like you're stuck
with little old me.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.746
Well, I'd throw my hat
in the ring.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.915
(stammers) You want
to be the president, huh?

13:36.917 --> 13:39.617
No, no, no, I just don't want
you to be the president.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.086
(laughs)

13:42.088 --> 13:43.254
Well, great.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.924
Well, the next vote is
in-in four years, so...

13:45.926 --> 13:47.592
I say we revote
right now.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.793
(stammers)

13:48.795 --> 13:50.428
Well, I would like
to give a speech.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.597
No speeches, all in favor
of Phil being president,

13:52.599 --> 13:54.065
raise your hand.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.770
Carol.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.472
Well, looks like we
have a new president.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.007
(clears throat)

14:11.451 --> 14:13.451
PHIL 2 (laughing):
Oh, no, no.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.452
I don't have anything to say.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.822
Well, I-I guess I should ask.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.358
Why did you guys choose
to live in Tucson?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.627
I mean, no offense,
but in this new world,

14:22.629 --> 14:25.463
Tucson is pretty much the worst
place to sustain human life.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.799
Hey, Tucson is my hometown,

14:27.801 --> 14:30.702
and I will not hear it be
slandered like that.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.670
Wonderful universities,
great zoo;

14:32.672 --> 14:34.205
multiple periodicals
have named it

14:34.207 --> 14:35.974
one of the top ten
places to retire.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.877
Okay.
Multiple periodicals,
not just one.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.813
Don't get me wrong...
We're here, Mr. President,

14:41.815 --> 14:43.481
because Tandy, here,

14:43.483 --> 14:45.817
had the good sense
to put up

14:45.819 --> 14:47.385
those "Alive in
Tucson" signs,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.454
so we should all
be thanking him.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.323
All right, no disrespect
to Tucson,

14:52.325 --> 14:54.559
but I'm talking about farming.
Yes.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.527
Growing fresh foods.
Fantastic.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.997
PHIL 2:
Water.
CAROL: That's what
I've been saying.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.498
That's why I planted
my own garden,

15:00.500 --> 15:01.699
but it's just not enough.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.701
Uh, thanks a lot, Mr. President.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.904
Or should I say
"Mr. Spoiler Alert"?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.205
What are you
talking about, Tandy?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.942
My surprise, which this guy
just spoil-alerted.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.011
I've made us a farm,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.179
a viable, sustainable,
working farm.

15:15.181 --> 15:15.914
I did that.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.582
Nope. No, you didn't.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.050
Uh, I sure did, Melissa.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.686
Uh, I found some good
forgivable Tucson land,

15:21.688 --> 15:23.922
and I plowed it, I raked it,
I tilled it,

15:23.924 --> 15:26.257
I sewed it, I farmed it.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.026
And that was gonna be
a big surprise come harvest,

15:28.028 --> 15:29.727
till this guy ruined it.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.029
With his big mouth.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.064
Can we take a look
at it, your farm?

15:33.066 --> 15:35.099
(scoffs)
Yeah, let's go.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.734
Let-let's do it.
Let's go right now.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.102
Let's go right now.
Right... Oh, shoot.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.204
Shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.906
It's late, and,
uh, you know,

15:41.908 --> 15:44.709
dark and cold--
the plants are, uh, resting.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.110
What about first thing
in the morning?

15:46.879 --> 15:48.112
First thing in the morning...

15:48.114 --> 15:50.415
as early as we can do it, yeah.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.716
Good.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.418
First thing come morn,

15:53.420 --> 15:57.488
we'll go see... my farm.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.560
Come on.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.062
Come on, be a tractor.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.930
Be a tractor for me.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.632
I need some kind of key or...?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.600
Oh, something happened.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.236
Oh! Oh!

16:12.238 --> 16:14.238
Nothing.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.406
Damn it.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.607
(sighs)

16:16.609 --> 16:17.909
Come on...!

16:17.911 --> 16:20.478
(shouts in frustration)

16:23.649 --> 16:25.416
You know what they say.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.485
Bros before hoes.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.420
Boom. I still got it.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.222
(whoops)

16:47.773 --> 16:48.806
(shouts)

16:48.808 --> 16:50.441
(laughs)

16:50.443 --> 16:51.943
(whoops)

16:51.945 --> 16:53.945
TANDY:
<i>Cock a doodle doo!</i>

16:53.947 --> 16:56.647
Tandy Farms is open
for business!

16:56.649 --> 16:57.949
Who wants to go see
TODD:
Tandy...

16:57.951 --> 17:00.018
a genuine farm...?
Tandy.

17:00.786 --> 17:01.953
Todd, what's the matter?

17:01.955 --> 17:04.288
It's Phil, new Phil.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.790
What happened?
What did he do?

17:05.792 --> 17:06.858
He had sex with them.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.626
Sex with who?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.795
All of 'em.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.398
He had sex with all of 'em!

17:14.133 --> 17:17.535
(weeping):
Oh, Tandy...!

17:22.641 --> 17:24.375
Carol, I cannot believe you.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.210
Have you no morals?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.378
What are you
talking about?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.147
Oh, you know
what I'm talking about.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.382
Hey, uh, Carol,
where are the other two?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.851
Oh, they headed home,
but they say "thank you."

17:33.853 --> 17:36.054
We all had a wonderful time.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.555
MELISSA:
Oh, my God.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.223
That was amazing.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.392
What is happening here?!

17:41.394 --> 17:42.894
So you ready to go
check out your farm?

17:42.896 --> 17:45.830
Haven't you done enough
plowing for one day?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.065
MELISSA: I can't
believe I got

17:47.067 --> 17:48.733
to take a shower.
Yeah.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.734
Thank you.
You're welcome.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.669
A shower.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.172
Oh, my God-- private
individual showers.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.606
That's all you were doing?

17:56.708 --> 17:58.009
Nobody else.
No... (stammers)

17:58.011 --> 17:59.710
Like, s-same-sex
showers.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.012
One person at a time.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.247
You were nowhere there
to be, uh, seen?

18:04.183 --> 18:05.683
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.884
This is all making
sense to me.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.352
<i>Made</i> sense to me,
that's what I thought.

18:08.354 --> 18:11.089
You know, just Todd had
said that you had all done,

18:11.091 --> 18:12.390
uh, something else.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.559
Well, Todd's been wrong
about a lot of stuff lately.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.128
Yeah. Bye.
Bye.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.897
So... farm.

18:19.899 --> 18:20.898
Yeah.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.467
Let's go.
Yeah, sure.

18:23.402 --> 18:25.436
PHIL: Just friends
taking showers,

18:25.438 --> 18:28.439
individually, toweling
off on their own,

18:28.441 --> 18:31.242
coming out, joining each other
once they're fully clothed.

18:31.244 --> 18:35.213
Nice job, Tandy,
this is a really good start.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.380
So what'd you plant?

18:36.382 --> 18:38.783
Ah, you know--
the necessities.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.886
Everything from, uh,
fruits to veggies.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.621
Good work.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.056
Yeah.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.758
Look, I'm sorry, uh,
things got a little tense

18:47.760 --> 18:48.926
between us this week.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.095
Uh, looking at
what you did,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.097
I realize I may
have been off base.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.799
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.902
Yeah... you're welcome.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.738
You know, I-I just want
to say I feel like

19:00.740 --> 19:02.406
you caught me
on a weird week.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.241
That's for sure.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.242
Yeah, when you
showed up,

19:04.244 --> 19:05.943
I kind of reared up
on my haunches

19:05.945 --> 19:07.578
and let out a little
warning roar.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.913
It's pure animal instinct.

19:08.915 --> 19:09.914
You feel me, Philbert?

19:09.916 --> 19:10.915
Oh, I feel you.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.116
Yeah.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.918
So we cool?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.119
We way cool.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.188
Mondo cool.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.358
(quietly imitates explosion)

19:21.460 --> 19:23.427
TANDY: <i>I wish you guys</i>
<i>had been there to see it.</i>

19:23.429 --> 19:25.630
He was so impressed with me.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.099
I mean, we really reached
an understanding.

19:28.101 --> 19:31.102
And, sure, for a while,
we were like two alpha dogs

19:31.104 --> 19:33.104
baring our teeth,
and peeing everywhere

19:33.106 --> 19:34.772
to mark our territory,

19:34.774 --> 19:35.973
but it came out a draw.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.609
As often happens
in the animal kingdom.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.977
Bottom line--

19:39.979 --> 19:41.512
(chuckles)
he respects me.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.981
You know, he knows
this is my land.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.117
And he knows not
to step on my turf.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.186
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

19:48.954 --> 19:50.254
Phil.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.124
You changed your nails up?

19:53.126 --> 19:54.625
Different cats.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.960
I like it.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.461
(giggles)

19:57.463 --> 19:58.462
You noticed.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.697
Yeah.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.532
Scarf looks good.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.869
You noticed.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.872
Come on.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.543
Respect.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.313
This is Tandy Land,
and he knows it.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.015
He smells the spray, he's trying
to tip-toe through it.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.017
But it's all over
his feet and legs.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.886
(chuckles)
Poor guy.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.021
Mmm, Phil.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.023
Oh, there you go,
you big camper.
(grunts)

20:26.025 --> 20:28.059
Oh, now put the food
in the bear box.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.393
The food's in the box, baby.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.362
Put it high up in the tree
so the bears can't get to it.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.197
It's in the tree,
it's high up there.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.865
Yeah, it is.
Way out of reach.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.735
Put a log on the fire,
get those mosquitoes away, Phil!

20:37.737 --> 20:39.904
Can't stand those
damn mosquitoes!
Get 'em!

20:39.906 --> 20:41.505
CAROL:
Oh, Phil!

20:41.507 --> 20:43.407
PHIL 2: I want a
s'more right now!

20:43.409 --> 20:44.208
To Carol.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.910
To Carol.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.346
That lucky B-word.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.413
CAROL: Oh,
I want chocolate.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.715
PHIL 2: What kind of
chocolate do you want?

20:50.717 --> 20:52.383
I want the darkest
chocolate!
The darkest chocolate!

20:52.385 --> 20:54.852
CAROL:
Yeah, Phil Miller!

20:54.854 --> 20:57.221
Oh...!

20:57.223 --> 20:58.422
Oh, you've
camped before.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.424
PHIL 2: I love
camping...

21:00.426 --> 21:03.160
(Carol and Phil 2
continue indistinctly)

21:09.868 --> 21:11.869
We got to kill this guy.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.738
I'm in.
