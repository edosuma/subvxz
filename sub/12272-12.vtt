00:03.100 --> 00:04.900
<i>Nobody knew he was coming.</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.900
<i>Nobody knew his name.</i>

00:09.400 --> 00:10.700
<i>Well, if you'd stop talking
for a minute, you'd understand.</i>

00:10.800 --> 00:14.800
<i>The investigation's been
compromised.</i>

00:14.900 --> 00:16.600
<i>Lives are at risk.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:19.100
<i>How many people
do the right thing anymore?</i>

00:19.100 --> 00:20.000
<i>Have a conscience?</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:22.800
<i>Don Cook didn't even know
what he saw.</i>

00:24.200 --> 00:25.600
<i>El Matocho doesn't kill
for the thrill</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:27.200
<i>or because he was abused
as a child.</i>

00:27.300 --> 00:30.100
<i>He kills because
it's his answer to everything.</i>

00:30.600 --> 00:33.000
<i>I had him eyewitnessed.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:34.800
<i>It was enough
for an indictment.</i>

00:34.900 --> 00:36.000
<i>No indictment, no trial.</i>

00:36.000 --> 00:37.900
<i>He goes free
and La Tijera gets stronger.</i>

00:37.900 --> 00:40.900
<i>So don't patronize me by saying
this might be an accident.</i>

00:42.900 --> 00:44.500
<i>????  I don't care who's on call,
Conrad,</i>

00:44.500 --> 00:46.200
<i>??? or about your stupid protocol.</i>

00:46.200 --> 00:47.700
<i>I want Grissom.</i>

00:47.800 --> 00:51.500
1000 Chestnut
and 918...

00:52.000 --> 00:54.400
Maybe the reception sucks
out here.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.000
I said I want Grissom.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.800
Say I asked for him personally.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.400
I don't want anyone
touching anything.

01:05.400 --> 01:05.900
Thanks for all

01:05.900 --> 01:08.000
your help, guys.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.700
Case is reassigned to Grissom.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.000
He's home sick, Maddy.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah, I heard all about it
from Ecklie. Blah, blah, blah.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
The point that he and you
seem to be missing

01:18.000 --> 01:19.300
is that I have 18

01:19.300 --> 01:21.200
grand jurists sifting
through evidence,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.400
trying to help me indict one
of the deadliest gangs

01:23.400 --> 01:24.200
this city has ever...

01:24.200 --> 01:26.000
Who's in charge of the scene?!

01:26.200 --> 01:27.100
I am.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.500
For God's sake.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.300
Madeleine Klein, Deputy DA.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.900
Albert Robbins,
Clark County Coroner.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.500
BRASS:
Talk to me, David.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.900
Confirms it's Don Cook.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.400
This is on us.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.500
What do you got, Doc?

01:49.700 --> 01:51.600
Other than the obvious burns
over the better part

01:51.600 --> 01:54.000
of his body,
there's this.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.700
He was shot.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.700
mxcc ???

03:09.700 --> 03:11.800
Isolated stretch of Route 2,

03:12.100 --> 03:13.900
burned car on the shoulder,

03:14.100 --> 03:17.200
burned male victim
out of the car 20 feet away.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.800
Single gunshot wound
to the lower back.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.400
Passing motorist called it in.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.300
Fire department arrived
within 12 minutes.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.500
Fire burned so hot,
they had to use foam

03:26.600 --> 03:29.600
to put it out, which, of course,
is never good for us.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.500
Where is he?

03:34.400 --> 03:35.900
I've been waiting
over an hour for you.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.300
What, are you walking here?

03:39.600 --> 03:41.100
How many times have
I gotten out of bed

03:41.100 --> 03:43.300
in the middle of the
night for you, Gil?

03:44.500 --> 03:48.100
Yeah. Yeah, well, I'd like
to phone it in, too.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.800
I left an AA meeting
for this.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.700
Trumps walking pneumonia.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.600
Here you go,
Eyes-and-Ears.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.200
We'll keep in touch.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.800
So the Deputy DA got out of bed
for you?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.700
Whose bed?

04:02.800 --> 04:04.200
Talk to me about the road.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.100
All right.

04:05.800 --> 04:11.300
The debris path starts
approximately 100 yards

04:11.300 --> 04:13.000
from where the vehicle
came to rest.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.800
Show me what you see.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.000
What are you doing,
a catalog shoot?

04:35.300 --> 04:37.000
Where's your matching hat
with your pom-pom?

04:37.300 --> 04:39.400
Leave me alone.
I have a cold.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.400
So, based on the
debris pattern,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.600
the victim was driving the car
when the blaze started.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.400
Swerving all over
the road.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.700
Probably because he was on fire.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.500
What do you think?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.400
Sounds about right.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.800
Gesundheit.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.100
Thanks.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.000
<i>Boy, I hope
I'm not getting sick.</i>

05:20.000 --> 05:22.500
I'm not finding any pour
patterns on the exterior.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.000
The hood

05:24.100 --> 05:25.700
and the front quarter panels
are down to the primer

05:25.700 --> 05:27.600
and the front tires are
burnt down to the rim.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.500
Think the fire
probably started in
the engine compartment.

05:30.700 --> 05:31.300
New car engines

05:31.300 --> 05:33.500
don't catch fire,
not by accident.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.800
Now we'll have to get it back
to the lab for a closer look.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.200
And guys on fire don't stop
to close doors.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.800
No, no, I talked to the
battalion chief about that.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.600
He said the driver's
side was open

05:43.600 --> 05:44.800
when his boys showed up,

05:44.800 --> 05:47.900
and that the pressure from
the hose probably closed it.

05:47.900 --> 05:48.900
Probably?

05:50.500 --> 05:51.800
Hosers.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.000
Nick, come here.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.300
Clear that off, would you?

06:09.900 --> 06:13.000
"L-A-T." That's La Tijera's tag.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.600
Boy, you look like hell.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.700
I need sugar. You got a soda?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.400
Nice to see you, too, Maddy.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.200
Six months' worth
of investigation;

06:26.200 --> 06:27.900
two months working
with the grand jury;

06:27.900 --> 06:30.600
five low-level indictments
against the LATs.

06:30.700 --> 06:34.100
Why you? 'Cause you're the only
one who won't screw it up.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.300
My team won't
screw it up.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.800
Oh, right.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.800
Your team.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.500
Warrick Brown got mixed up
with a crooked judge.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.800
Sanders ran down a civilian
while on duty.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.100
Ms. Willows lied about
being at a crime scene,

06:50.100 --> 06:51.400
among other things.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.800
And who can forget Stokes,
your straight arrow?

06:55.900 --> 06:58.100
Suspected of killing
his hooker girlfriend.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.300
How does the song go?

07:00.300 --> 07:02.600
"You call me up,
I get 'em out of it"?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.400
If it weren't for me,
you'd have no team.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.100
Are you done?

07:07.900 --> 07:09.900
Sorry. You have a...?

07:16.700 --> 07:18.600
This was recorded two weeks ago.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.400
This guy had no idea

07:21.400 --> 07:22.200
that what he saw

07:22.200 --> 07:24.000
was the key to bringing
down La Tijera

07:24.000 --> 07:25.800
and their leader
El Matocho.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.600
Okay, I know this
is my third violation,

07:31.600 --> 07:33.200
but I was not speeding.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.000
I-I blew past that light because
I had a fight with my wife.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.200
Listen, you're not here
for a traffic violation, okay?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.400
Now, after you ran
the red light,

07:43.400 --> 07:44.900
the street camera
didn't pick you up

07:44.900 --> 07:46.600
at the next intersection.
Where'd you go?

07:47.100 --> 07:51.300
Okay, look, I, I cannot have
my license suspended.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.600
I have a vending machine
business.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.300
You're not here
for a traffic violation.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.700
Let's get that straight.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.500
Now, did you see anyone
in particular?

07:58.700 --> 07:59.900
You remember that night?

07:59.900 --> 08:02.700
Yeah, yeah, no. Um, yeah,
there was, there was a guy

08:02.700 --> 08:04.200
who walked past my car.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.300
Okay.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.000
I thought I was gonna get robbed
on top of everything else.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.300
Can you identify
him, hmm?

08:10.700 --> 08:11.800
Sure, yeah.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.500
He walked under a streetlight.
I saw him. I saw him real clear.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
He, um...

08:15.700 --> 08:20.800
He was Hispanic, uh, I don't
know, bald, scary-looking.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.800
"LAT" carved into the cheek
of the victim

08:24.800 --> 08:27.000
is the signature
of El Matocho,

08:27.400 --> 08:28.800
La Tijera's number one.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.100
He killed this guy...
Little Gordo,

08:31.300 --> 08:34.000
but he was a ghost;
no face, no name.

08:35.900 --> 08:39.299
<i>Until Don Cook ID'd
Emilio Alvarado</i>

08:39.799 --> 08:41.400
<i>coming out
of Little Gordo's house</i>

08:41.400 --> 08:42.799
<i>around the time of the murder.</i>

08:43.100 --> 08:44.100
Turns out Alvarado

08:44.100 --> 08:46.000
was caught up
in a gang sweep

08:46.000 --> 08:47.900
day after the murder.
Parole violation.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.300
He got 30 days.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.400
PD thought
he was just another lowlife.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.900
Due to be released in 52 hours.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.700
Can't indict Alvarado
with a dead witness.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.000
We need to prove conspiracy.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.500
You need to prove that Alvarado
ordered a hit on your witness.

09:03.700 --> 09:04.900
How long do you think
it'll take you

09:04.900 --> 09:07.500
to bone up on these
and put a suit on?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.500
Can I smoke in here?

09:11.500 --> 09:12.700
Uh, no.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.100
It's a... it's a
government building.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.700
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.300
So when was the last time
you saw Don?

09:24.700 --> 09:25.800
Last night.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.300
We go to my folks' house
every Sunday.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.600
Mrs. Cook, did you know
that your husband was going

09:32.600 --> 09:34.800
to testify before a grand jury?

09:34.900 --> 09:36.300
We talked about it.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.100
I told him
I didn't want him to do it.

09:40.200 --> 09:44.200
But he found out about this
girl, what the gang did to her.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.400
Did he confide in anyone else?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.600
He said it was a secret.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.400
Did you tell anyone?

09:53.400 --> 09:54.300
No.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.900
Well... sort of.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.200
I told my mom and dad
and my best friend Jenny.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.300
She's my hairdresser.
I tell her everything.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.300
I'm gonna need
their phone numbers.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.800
Did I do something wrong?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.200
Oh, hey, Dave,

10:18.200 --> 10:21.000
nice haircut.
What gives?

10:21.300 --> 10:24.100
Oh, Mrs. Phillips.
An extreme makeover.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.000
Mm. Oh, make sure you get
those photos to Grissom.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.300
I'm all over it.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.000
Sign of a good marriage.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.000
Wife still wants to change him.

10:33.700 --> 10:38.300
So your vic's burns are
concentrated on the face, hands,

10:39.100 --> 10:40.300
knees and feet.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.200
It's consistent
with an engine fire.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.600
Jacketed hollowpoint.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.900
One cannelure.
Looks like a .38.

10:54.900 --> 10:55.300
Yeah.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.400
Entered through
the right renal artery.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.600
That's COD.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.900
Wow. I bet it
reeks in here.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.700
I wouldn't know.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.300
Thank God for stuffy noses.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.300
Yeah.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.200
DA Klein asked Grissom,

11:21.200 --> 11:24.000
who asked Catherine,
who told me to tell you that

11:24.000 --> 11:27.100
we need to figure out
if the victim was shot

11:27.300 --> 11:30.400
before he got in the car,
while he was in the car

11:30.400 --> 11:32.100
or after he got out.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.800
Okay, uh, there was
no blood trail at the scene.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.100
Fire pretty much
took care of that.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.600
And I doubt you're gonna find
any trace of blood

11:39.600 --> 11:41.000
in that burnt-up driver seat.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.400
Wow, I've got to give her
more than that.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.800
Be my guest.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.800
Skin on a seat belt buckle.

12:10.000 --> 12:10.900
You know,

12:10.900 --> 12:12.600
if I got shot
and I'm trying to get away,

12:12.600 --> 12:15.000
I'm not gonna take the time
to put my seat belt on.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.100
Eliminates the first scenario.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.200
So either the shooter
kidnaps him and shot him

12:20.200 --> 12:21.800
while he was driving...
I don't know.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.400
Greg, I think
we would have found evidence

12:23.400 --> 12:25.300
of somebody else
inside the vehicle.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.800
Which leaves us
with the last scenario.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
I think I just found my reason
for getting out of bed

12:34.600 --> 12:35.500
this morning.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.300
Check it out.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.100
The same guy that
tampered with the car

12:46.400 --> 12:47.500
could have followed.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.100
Made sure the job was done.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.600
Who killed him?
Do you have evidence
that the witness

12:52.600 --> 12:53.900
was murdered?
How did they kill him?

12:53.900 --> 12:55.500
One at a time, Miss Leahy.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.800
Do you know who killed him?

12:57.100 --> 12:58.300
We don't know yet.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.800
Our investigation
is still ongoing.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.000
What was the guy gonna tell us?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.900
Until Dr. Grissom can
corroborate Mr. Cook's

13:06.900 --> 13:08.200
testimony,
I can't tell you

13:08.200 --> 13:10.100
the content.
Mr. O'Shea.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.400
We've been locked up in here
ten hours a day,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
two months,
all cloak-and-dagger.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.000
La Tijera doesn't know
we're investigating them,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
so they couldn't know
about the witness.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.800
Well, we found their signature
at the crime scene.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.700
So it's possible
they do know.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.200
If they got to this witness,
could they get to us?

13:29.900 --> 13:31.000
I have a family.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
So do I.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.800
I want to know how the gang
found out about Don Cook.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.600
O'SHEA:
Me, too.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.200
Or else I want
off this jury.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.900
1B ???

13:50.100 --> 13:51.400
Got any coffee?

13:52.400 --> 13:53.800
I got lots of tea.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.200
Good.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.700
You know, when we first
asked Cook to testify

13:59.700 --> 14:02.300
he said no,
and, uh, but...

14:02.300 --> 14:03.800
you know, I couldn't let it go.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.800
So I called him up
about a week later

14:07.800 --> 14:10.500
and, uh, took him to lunch
and I showed him a picture

14:10.500 --> 14:13.500
of, uh... of a girl
that they had killed, you know.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.200
She was 16, innocent, beautiful.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.400
She was raped, shot,

14:21.700 --> 14:22.900
and urinated on.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.200
And when that
didn't kill her,

14:24.200 --> 14:28.100
they slit her throat.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.400
So I had him on the hook.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.100
When I told him that,
uh, you know, if he testified,

14:36.100 --> 14:39.200
I'd protect him and his family
if the case ever came to trial.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.300
On Friday, he called Maddy,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.500
said he changed his mind,
he'd testify.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.500
And on Sunday...

14:56.200 --> 14:57.800
he was dead.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.200
I couldn't protect him.

15:08.800 --> 15:09.800
Thanks.

15:31.100 --> 15:31.800
Hey, buddy.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.500
Hey.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.300
Oh, man,
you look beat up.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.700
I feel beat up.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.100
Why don't you, uh,
take a break. I got this.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.100
No, no, I'm cool.
I can push through it.

15:42.100 --> 15:42.700
Yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.900
You're, uh, breaking
the Lab's budget

15:47.900 --> 15:49.400
for rubber gloves
here, dawg.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.900
Listen, get some rest, man.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.500
You'd do the same for me.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.600
Yeah, okay.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.800
I processed the driver's side.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.300
I was about to get to the
passenger's side glove box.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.700
I owe you one, man.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.200
Yeah, you do.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.300
Mr. O'Malley?
Detective Jim Brass.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.500
Can I talk to you?
Sure.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.200
Ballistics has confirmed
that your son-in-law

17:41.200 --> 17:42.500
was killed with your gun.

17:43.400 --> 17:43.800
Wait a minute.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.200
You told me this morning
he died in a car fire.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
I know what I told you,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.700
but why didn't you
tell me about the gun?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.100
How did it end up in his car?

17:52.600 --> 17:53.900
Go inside.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.700
I gave it to him.
Why?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.900
Because he asked me for it.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.800
All right, look,
it's got five rounds in it.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.000
There's no safety on it.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.300
So all I got to do
is just point it and shoot it?

18:08.500 --> 18:10.900
Yeah. Now look, if you think
you're being followed,

18:10.900 --> 18:12.900
don't be a hero.
Call the police.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.300
Hey, look, I begged Donnie
not to testify.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
He and Cody had
everything to lose.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.600
They were doing great with
their vending machines.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.300
No grandkids yet,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.300
but that's probably
'cause their marriage

18:23.300 --> 18:24.900
was shaky already.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.100
Cody has her
mother's temper.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.400
She loved him though.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
We all did.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.900
Look, as long as I'm
out here, do you mind
if I look around?

18:34.100 --> 18:36.100
My wife and daughter
are pretty upset.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.200
I don't want you guys in here
bothering them anymore.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.700
<i>CSI Sanders</i>

19:26.700 --> 19:28.800
<i>confirmed that the trajectory
of the gun lined up</i>

19:28.800 --> 19:30.000
<i>with the victim's body as he</i>

19:30.000 --> 19:31.600
<i>tried to exit the vehicle.</i>

19:32.000 --> 19:33.700
<i>The engine fire would have
reached approximately</i>

19:33.700 --> 19:36.400
<i>800 degrees within two minutes.</i>

19:36.800 --> 19:39.000
<i>Enough heat was transmitted
to the glove box</i>

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
<i>to cause the gun inside
to discharge.</i>

19:41.500 --> 19:43.300
Witness was killed
by his own gun.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.500
Do you know who set the fire?

19:47.100 --> 19:48.200
No, Your Honor, not yet.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.900
CSI found La Tijera's tag

19:49.900 --> 19:51.800
painted on the car's
rear bumper.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.200
You can't charge the
entire gang, counsel.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.100
Alvarado's set to be
released in just

19:56.100 --> 19:58.200
over 24 hours.
If he gets out...

19:58.300 --> 19:59.500
we lose him forever.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.400
We need a warrant
to search his apartment.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.000
I can't give you
a warrant just because

20:03.000 --> 20:04.700
she doesn't want him
to get out of jail.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
Where's your
probable cause?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.000
You saw the video.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.200
Cook placed Alvarado
at the house

20:10.200 --> 20:11.700
at the time of the murder.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.700
Mere presence.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.400
Counsel, I got to get
back to my trial.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.800
Your Honor, Alvarado is
an admitted member of La Tijera.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.000
Their initials were carved
into the cheek

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
of the murder victim

20:24.400 --> 20:27.000
in the house that
Alvarado was seen exiting.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.000
We need the clothes that
Alvarado was wearing that night.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.500
Hopefully, he didn't have time
to do his laundry.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.300
The grand jurors
are on board with this?

20:34.700 --> 20:35.900
They will be, Your Honor.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.200
Hey, Griss.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.700
Restocked your case.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
You were low
on batteries and pheno.

21:09.100 --> 21:09.800
Thank you.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.500
You're welcome.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.500
Apartment 5967.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.000
Alvarado's crib.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.200
Hey, Grissom, I got tickets
to the Rebels tomorrow night.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.000
If you're feeling any better
and you want to check it out.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.400
I'll be in bed.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.600
You feeling okay?

21:44.900 --> 21:47.700
Yeah. My ears are
still ringing, though.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.100
This place reeks
of sulfur.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.300
I found about
ten of these butane cans so far.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.800
Any evidence that's here
is gone.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.000
Yeah, well,
there's burn patterns

22:03.000 --> 22:04.100
all over these walls.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.400
They must have splashed butane
all over everything.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.000
And butane dissipates quick.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.600
The other guy was probably
watching us the whole time.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.000
There's nails
all over the place.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.100
Grissom, I think I found
the point of origin.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.200
Green plastic.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.400
Sugar, butane,
and nails.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.200
Add some

22:42.200 --> 22:43.400
egg whites in a soda bottle.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.600
You got a MacGyver bomb.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.700
Crude, but it works.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.400
I think they were looking to do
more than just destroy evidence.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.000
You running for
warrants, Mitch?

22:53.000 --> 22:53.800
Yeah.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.200
Impound their cars.
You got it.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.900
Mitch, I want to see
this guy's hands.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.600
You ain't a cop, fool.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
He's bigger than a cop.
Show him your hands, princess.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.000
They're clean.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.500
Want to lick 'em
and find out?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.400
You think
this is a game?

23:31.700 --> 23:32.400
Huh?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.000
This one's clean.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.800
What about this one?

23:39.300 --> 23:40.200
Clean.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.400
Turn his pockets.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.500
Sugar.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.200
What's this?

23:52.500 --> 23:53.800
You been baking cookies?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.100
So, who gave you the order
to torch that apartment?

23:57.700 --> 23:59.700
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.700
And why that
apartment?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.300
Who do you know lives there?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.100
Nobody.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.300
I got a mental illness.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.200
I'm a firebug.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.400
<i>I'm loco.</i>

24:10.400 --> 24:12.300
<i>You're loco?
Who knows?</i>

24:12.800 --> 24:15.800
Maybe I'll set the lawyer
lady's house on fire.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.200
Hey, little man
with the big mouth.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.900
It doesn't matter
what you say,

24:20.100 --> 24:21.500
'cause all your boys
are going to hear

24:21.500 --> 24:23.400
is that you rolled on Alvarado.

24:23.645 --> 24:24.645
Sit down.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.900
Just bought yourself
another ten years.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.800
I'm going to hand-pick
your cell mate.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.300
Well, that didn't help.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.300
That kid wouldn't roll
if I gave him a night
with Jessica Alba.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.400
You're pretty good
at making enemies, Maddy.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.400
That's why I'm unlisted,
divorced and carry a gun.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.700
Did you take Cook back
to Little Gordo's house?

24:42.700 --> 24:44.800
You know, maybe
to verify his story?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, I always take
my secret witnesses

24:47.000 --> 24:48.500
on a bus tour
of the "hood."

24:48.500 --> 24:50.400
You know, when Don Cook
first refused to testify

24:50.400 --> 24:52.600
that he saw Alvarado come
out of Little Gordo's house,

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
you know what I did?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.200
I took him to an
out-of-town diner

24:55.200 --> 24:56.700
and bought him
a cup of coffee.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
What'd you do?

25:00.100 --> 25:01.700
I went to Little Gordo's.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.500
Damn it.

25:06.700 --> 25:07.900
Good job, Maddy.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.300
They saw me.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
I can't even blame it
on the booze.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.200
All they had to do was trail me
back to the courthouse

25:17.200 --> 25:19.100
and watch me go
into the security entrance

25:19.100 --> 25:20.400
with 18 escorted jurors.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.800
That's how they knew grand jury.

25:21.800 --> 25:22.800
Damn it!

25:29.600 --> 25:31.100
This is where you're
supposed to say,

25:31.100 --> 25:33.000
"It's okay. It could
happen to anyone.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.300
It's not your fault
Don Cook is dead."

25:37.400 --> 25:38.800
Like hell it isn't.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.300
Hey, Nick!

25:46.100 --> 25:47.700
You've got an artful tagger.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.800
What?

25:49.900 --> 25:51.400
Don Cook's car bumper.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.000
Gangbanger blended his green
with another color.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.600
Not visible to
the human eye.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.700
Of course,
I caught it.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.600
You mean
the GCMS caught it?

25:58.800 --> 26:00.400
Well, if that's a hair
you want to split.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.400
Suspect used green paint
with a hint of cerulean blue.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.700
Probably for impact.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.200
You know, in China
people wear masks
when they're sick.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.000
It's considered impolite
to infect your coworkers.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.800
Maybe you should go
work in China.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.700
Maybe you should wear a mask.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.100
Now, this is everything
Alvarado had

26:23.100 --> 26:24.700
and was wearing
when they arrested him?

26:27.800 --> 26:28.600
Thank you.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.400
He's been in isolation
for two weeks.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.100
I could tell you everything
he's got in his cell.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.400
They assigned
me special.

26:59.900 --> 27:01.600
Does he get
any yard time?
Nope.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.200
I take him
for hall walks.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.800
Not allowed any contact
with anybody but me.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.500
Why do you need to see him?

27:07.600 --> 27:09.000
Just want to rattle
his cage a bit.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.100
That cool
with you?
Good luck.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.000
Hey, Alvarado,

27:14.200 --> 27:14.900
get up.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.500
Cell check.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.400
So, you always clean your boots
with bleach, El Matocho?

28:06.200 --> 28:07.300
Something funny?

28:09.500 --> 28:10.600
<i>Matocho.</i>

28:11.000 --> 28:12.400
Nonsense word.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.800
You know where
this name comes from?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.300
There's a legend
in Central America.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.400
This man,
he woke up in a bad mood.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.700
Killed eight members
of his family with a machete

28:25.200 --> 28:26.900
and then went and had breakfast.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.000
<i>Matar.</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
To kill.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.900
<i>Ocho. Eight.</i>

28:37.300 --> 28:38.700
"To kill eight."

28:40.800 --> 28:42.400
<i>El Matocho.</i>

28:47.400 --> 28:48.300
That's great.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.600
The way I see it, you're going
to have lots of time

28:51.600 --> 28:53.400
to tell all kinds
of great stories.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.400
Tick-tock.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.700
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.100
Tick-tock.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.900
<i>Alvarado is a suspect
in three cases.</i>

29:05.400 --> 29:06.800
First, he allegedly
kills

29:06.800 --> 29:08.700
Little Gordo.
Then,

29:08.900 --> 29:11.200
the only witness who could
identify him is killed.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.500
And last, but certainly
not least,

29:13.500 --> 29:15.400
he allegedly
orders Raphael Gomez

29:15.400 --> 29:17.500
to blow up
his apartment.
La Tijera

29:17.500 --> 29:19.600
is responsible
for all three crimes.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.500
Tags at both scenes,

29:21.500 --> 29:24.700
and Gomez is an admitted
member of the gang.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.100
According to Hodges,

29:26.400 --> 29:28.000
the tagger didn't
use spray paint.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.400
He used an oil-based
specialty paint.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.400
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.800
You got photos?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.000
Here you go.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.900
This "L" looks
like it was stenciled.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.200
Then, it looks
like the tagger

30:02.200 --> 30:03.400
painted over it
a second time,

30:03.400 --> 30:04.800
to make it look freehand.

30:04.900 --> 30:05.600
What?

30:08.900 --> 30:10.400
Yeah, those, uh...

30:10.800 --> 30:12.600
those do look
like brush strokes.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.900
Well, gangs don't
use paintbrushes.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I assumed the tags
were authentic.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.400
We've been moving in
the wrong direction.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.100
Cody, come on out here.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.700
So, you think this gang
messed with Don's car

30:25.700 --> 30:26.900
while we were
having dinner?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.800
That's what we're
here to find out.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.100
Cody, Mr. Brass wants
to talk to you.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.300
Hi, Cody.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.000
Where was your son-in-law's
car parked that night?

30:35.700 --> 30:36.800
Right over there.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.900
???

30:43.100 --> 30:44.600
Those are nice.
Did you make those?

30:44.700 --> 30:46.900
Yeah, a hobby of mine
after I lost my job.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.100
Forced retirement.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.500
You know
how it goes.
Mmm.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.800
Want to buy one?
(chuckles)

30:52.400 --> 30:54.800
You keep the garage door closed
when you're not working?

30:55.300 --> 30:57.200
Well, it's not like
we have any neighbors.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.600
Anything ever gone missing?

31:02.900 --> 31:05.000
Sure, Cody's taking stuff
all the time.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.800
She'd rather spend
her money on clothes.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.400
Kids.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.500
Mind if I take this crate?

31:14.400 --> 31:15.400
What for?

31:16.400 --> 31:17.700
Fingerprints.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.100
Well, you're going
to find mine all over.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.100
That's why I'm going
to get yours, too, sir.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.400
So I can exclude you.

31:23.900 --> 31:24.900
Follow me.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.100
So, let me get this
straight.

31:26.100 --> 31:26.800
You come to your parents'
house for dinner

31:27.300 --> 31:28.100
and Don's the only
one that leaves.

31:28.200 --> 31:31.200
I already told you
why I wasn't in that car.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.000
My husband and I
were arguing.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
He was yelling at me.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.500
Okay, I'm having a hard time
keeping it straight.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.500
You do like my dress?
You don't like my dress?

31:38.500 --> 31:40.400
Can we please just not talk
about this now?

31:40.600 --> 31:41.700
When should we talk
about it?

31:41.700 --> 31:43.100
Cody, get
in the car.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.600
No, I'm not going
to get in the car.

31:44.600 --> 31:48.300
Listen. I loved the dress till
I found out it cost 300 bucks.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.000
You have a closet full
of dresses...

31:51.300 --> 31:51.800
Get in the car.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.800
No. Not until you apologize.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.000
Apologize to my parents!

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm not apologizing.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.000
<i>I told him not to call me
until the court thing was over.</i>

31:59.000 --> 32:00.600
<i>I needed to cool off.</i>

32:01.600 --> 32:02.700
My dad says I was lucky.

32:03.000 --> 32:03.700
Ma'am,

32:04.300 --> 32:06.100
I'm going to need to get
your fingerprints, too.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.600
I don't like
where this is going.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.200
It's going downtown.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.100
So you killed him.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.000
And made it look
like a gang did it.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.200
And then you could buy all
the expensive dresses you want.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.700
I loved my husband.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.600
I didn't kill him, okay?

32:46.700 --> 32:48.000
You don't know me.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.500
You don't know my life.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.600
I found your fingerprints
on a stencil.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.200
It was the one
with green paint all over it.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.600
And the paint from one
of your paintbrushes

33:19.700 --> 33:20.500
is a match to the car.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.900
Your daughter said
you disappeared

33:28.100 --> 33:29.600
into the garage
right after dinner.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.300
That's when you stuck the rag
in the engine

33:32.500 --> 33:34.900
between the catalytic converter
and the heat shield.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.700
I think we all know
what that did. Hmm?

33:45.400 --> 33:47.200
Hey, you don't want to say
anything, fine.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.700
Write him up.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.600
Process him.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.600
You think the daughter
had anything to do with it?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.400
No.
How could you?!

34:00.500 --> 34:02.400
Cook was her meal ticket.
You son of a bitch!

34:02.500 --> 34:04.000
You were gonna kill
your own daughter?!

34:04.100 --> 34:05.700
No  I did this for you

34:05.800 --> 34:07.100
Over money so you
could get our business?!

34:07.400 --> 34:08.400
I would never let you
get in that car!

34:08.600 --> 34:10.900
Well, you didn't try to stop me!
You just stood there!

34:11.100 --> 34:13.400
How many Sundays did you come
over and bitch to your mother

34:13.600 --> 34:15.400
about that selfish,
ungrateful bastard?!

34:15.900 --> 34:17.900
Don wanted to give you
the money; I said no!

34:18.100 --> 34:20.600
And all those nights Mom
and I stayed up talking

34:20.800 --> 34:21.699
it was about you!

34:21.900 --> 34:23.500
You owed me!
I hate you!

34:23.800 --> 34:25.100
I did you a favor!

34:25.300 --> 34:26.400
Go to hell

34:33.900 --> 34:35.400
Never thought
I'd be disappointed

34:35.600 --> 34:36.600
that we solved a case.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.199
Hmm.

34:40.500 --> 34:41.699
Court personnel files?

34:43.100 --> 34:45.100
Reading upside down is a talent

34:45.699 --> 34:47.100
What are you looking for?

34:47.300 --> 34:48.400
The leak.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.199
90 minutes
after the warrant was issued,

34:51.300 --> 34:52.900
Alvarado's apartment went up.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.600
So you're looking at the judge,
his staff,

34:55.800 --> 34:57.300
the clerk that issued
the warrant,

34:57.500 --> 35:00.000
court reporter,
any cops who knew...

35:00.200 --> 35:03.100
Yeah, but according to this,
everybody cleared.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.300
The only ones left
are the grand jurors...

35:08.800 --> 35:10.100
??????

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Thanks for coming

35:16.200 --> 35:18.100
All right. No worries.
Wasn't sleeping anyway.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.300
Big surf movie marathon
on cable right now.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.400
<i>Ah.
Yeah, Big Wednesday,</i>

35:22.600 --> 35:24.200
<i>Endless Summer,
Local Boys.</i>

35:24.300 --> 35:25.300
Dude.
Yeah.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.400
So we need to review
some phone records, and fast.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.400
Okay. It's going to be tough
to go fast with that many names.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.900
Oh, no.
I can narrow it down.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.800
It's a 90-minute window,
yesterday,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.700
at 12:00 noon to 1:30.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.700
Just cell phone calls.
Okay.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.000
Give me a name and a number.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.800
Timothy O'Shea. 702...

35:45.900 --> 35:47.700
555 014

35:49.500 --> 35:51.600
He called two numbers.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.100
Do a reverse lookup.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.400
Looks like he called his wife
and his home line.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.700
Next.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.100
Cole Zampas...

36:00.300 --> 36:02.300
702-555-014...

36:02.500 --> 36:03.500
Jessica Varge...

36:03.900 --> 36:07.100
Darby Vance,
555-013...

36:07.300 --> 36:09.000
Marie Leahy.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.200
Okay.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.100
Huh. No user information.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.000
It usually means
disposable cell phone.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.800
Has she called
the number before,

36:20.900 --> 36:21.700
within the last two weeks?

36:23.100 --> 36:25.300
Monday through Friday,
both weeks,

36:26.200 --> 36:27.800
she called a different
disposable cell phone.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.600
That's weird.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.300
Okay. Try the text messages.

36:31.700 --> 36:32.300
Yeah.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.500
See the pattern?

36:41.300 --> 36:43.600
Every night
around 11:00 p.m.,

36:43.700 --> 36:45.100
someone texts her a number,

36:45.300 --> 36:46.800
which she then calls
the next day.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.400
How did they contact you,
Miss Leahy?

36:50.700 --> 36:54.700
Uh... a few weeks ago,
at a gas station near my house,

36:55.900 --> 36:56.700
this, uh...

36:57.500 --> 36:59.400
this woman comes up to me
and, uh...

37:00.700 --> 37:03.200
she knows everything
about Peter.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.100
That's my little brother
in Chicago.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.600
He's only 19.

37:09.700 --> 37:12.400
Got ten years
for something he didn't do.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.500
And she said they'd get him out.

37:16.700 --> 37:17.700
And they did.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.500
Guy just confessed
and my brother's set to go free.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.000
Did that witness die
because of me?

37:33.800 --> 37:35.400
Can you give us a description
of the woman?

37:37.600 --> 37:38.800
She was white,

37:39.700 --> 37:42.900
uh, short brown hair...

37:47.900 --> 37:48.900
I'm sorry.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.700
I only seen her once.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.100
Alvarado gets out
in the morning.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.500
It is the morning.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.100
Exactly.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.500
You know, none of these
people make a move

38:05.800 --> 38:07.300
without a direct order
from Alvarado,

38:07.500 --> 38:09.600
especially not torching
his own place.

38:09.900 --> 38:10.800
What are you saying?

38:11.700 --> 38:12.700
Well, think about it.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.300
When Marie leaked the warrant information,

38:14.500 --> 38:16.400
it had to have gone in and out
through him somehow.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.400
He's the boss.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.900
I don't see how; the guy's
in complete isolation.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.800
They even assigned him
a special hand-picked guard.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.800
Look.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.500
There's no privileges
in isolation.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.100
Things still move
in and out of his cell:

38:30.500 --> 38:31.600
laundry, food.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.200
The only thing I saw
from the outside was a book.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.300
They say he's a big reader.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.400
But I looked it over;
there's nothing.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.400
What about all the other books
he's been reading?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.700
How does Alvarado
get his books?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.100
It's like a regular library.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.000
When a book's checked out,
a trustee wres down

38:52.100 --> 38:55.000
the inmate's name,
booking number and date.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.400
Gets checked back in
the same way.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.500
I need to see every book
that Alvarado checked out.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.100
What Is the What?
The Infinite Plan,

39:09.400 --> 39:11.200
and Herzog.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.500
Oh... and  The Inferno.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.900
Alphabetical by author?

39:16.200 --> 39:17.000
Mm-hmm.

39:22.400 --> 39:25.200
David Eggers.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.700
There's pages missing.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.100
Allende.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.200
How many books has he read
in the last 48 hours?

39:57.900 --> 39:58.700
Two.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.700
He said he didn't like this one;

40:03.100 --> 40:04.300
returned it
yesterday afternoon.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.700
Where's  The Inferno?

40:23.300 --> 40:24.500
Hold up a minute.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.300
Orders to process him out.

40:27.000 --> 40:27.900
Just hold him.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.600
This is a good book,
Mr. Alvarado.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.500
Which Circle of Hell
would you be in?

40:47.500 --> 40:49.100
The Seventh, the outer one.

40:50.700 --> 40:53.200
Those who commit violence
against others.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.800
Souls plunge into a river
of boiling blood.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.200
Officer, do you have a lighter?

41:15.700 --> 41:17.400
No pen, no paper...

41:17.600 --> 41:20.100
so you used what you had, huh?

41:20.800 --> 41:22.400
A book for paper,

41:22.800 --> 41:25.200
and for ink, urine.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.200
Once the urine dries,

41:29.900 --> 41:32.100
the writing becomes
invisible....

41:32.300 --> 41:34.000
until it's heated,

41:34.300 --> 41:37.300
making the acid in the urine
turn brown.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.100
Then you, uh, put the book
back in the library,

41:44.200 --> 41:45.600
another prisoner checks it out,

41:45.800 --> 41:49.000
tears out the page,
gives it to a visitor,

41:49.200 --> 41:51.100
and you get your message out.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.100
Yes?

41:53.200 --> 41:56.400
Put him back
in his house.

41:58.100 --> 42:01.100
Mira, usted se va a morir.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.400
Well, I was right
about Alvarado:

42:27.500 --> 42:28.700
he was leaving Vegas.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.300
Otherwise, he would have
killed me himself.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.100
You okay?

42:37.200 --> 42:38.700
Yeah.

42:38.900 --> 42:41.300
Guess now,
I owe you one, huh?

42:42.400 --> 42:44.400
I don't keep score,
Madeleine.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.800
You know what, Gilbert?

42:48.000 --> 42:50.400
You're the only man I know
who's never let me down.

42:52.900 --> 42:56.300
Which means that you're either
a classic enabler

42:56.500 --> 42:57.900
or my soul mate.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.900
