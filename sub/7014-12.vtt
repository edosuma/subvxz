WEBVTT

00:07.888 --> 00:10.010
Hey, guys, this is my co-cadet

00:10.078 --> 00:12.770
at the police academy, Suzy Simpson.

00:12.837 --> 00:14.524
Simpson, these are my friends.

00:14.592 --> 00:16.347
Take a good look, 'cause you'll probably

00:16.415 --> 00:18.904
be arresting some of them in the future.

00:18.971 --> 00:21.534
You're right. This one looks like the guy

00:21.602 --> 00:24.465
in the "What drugs can
do to you" filmstrip.

00:27.563 --> 00:29.727
You're a cop, huh?

00:29.795 --> 00:32.725
You don't look like a cop.
You look kind of giggly.

00:33.292 --> 00:36.224
All right, Simpson needed
to give me a ride home,

00:36.292 --> 00:38.224
'cause I sprayed myself with mace

00:38.291 --> 00:41.090
to see what it'd feel like.

00:41.157 --> 00:41.655
Hey, so, Suzy,

00:41.656 --> 00:43.523
which "Charlie's Angels"
is your favorite...

00:43.591 --> 00:45.755
The brainy one, the sporty one

00:45.823 --> 00:48.188
or the one that just can't find a bra?

00:48.256 --> 00:51.522
Mine's the one that just can't find a bra.

00:51.590 --> 00:54.372
"Charlie's Angels" are an
embarrassment to the badge.

00:54.373 --> 00:57.005
No real cop would last a
day dressed like those sluts.

00:58.073 --> 01:01.406
Hey, those sluts are my heroes.

01:03.474 --> 01:05.940
Hey, thanks for giving me a ride, Simpson.

01:06.008 --> 01:07.475
We back up our own.

01:07.476 --> 01:09.772
Point place police,
crime free, safe streets!

01:12.307 --> 01:14.272
What's her problem
with "charlie's angels"?

01:14.340 --> 01:16.572
Ugh, I bet she watches pbs.

01:18.689 --> 01:19.857
So you and Simpson have been friends

01:19.925 --> 01:22.091
for almost two days now, huh?

01:22.159 --> 01:24.492
Isn't it about time you got her pregnant?

01:27.128 --> 01:29.128
No. It's different with me and Simpson.

01:29.196 --> 01:30.862
For the first time ever,

01:30.929 --> 01:32.862
I have a girl that's just a friend.

01:32.930 --> 01:34.995
Like, when Simpson
talks, I actually listen

01:35.063 --> 01:37.261
instead of watching her
boobs go up and down.

01:37.629 --> 01:40.562
Kelso, you've finally
gotten past the stage

01:40.630 --> 01:42.563
where you have to look
at every woman's chest.

01:42.630 --> 01:43.697
Congratulations.

01:43.764 --> 01:47.632
Not exactly. I'm lookin'
at yours right now.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.666
May I say, congratulations to you.

01:51.734 --> 01:52.901
You're such a perv.

01:52.919 --> 01:54.118
And thank you.

01:56.786 --> 01:58.419
Oh, hey.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.587
What took you guys so
long at the heart doctor's?

02:00.755 --> 02:03.056
Oh, let me guess. You had
to call in a specialist

02:03.057 --> 02:05.057
just to find dad's tiny heart.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.458
You know, we could call in a specialist

02:07.526 --> 02:09.925
to find my foot in your ass.

02:11.862 --> 02:14.995
We're gonna need an
ass-footologist, stat.

02:16.664 --> 02:19.131
Your father's blood
pressure is still high,

02:19.197 --> 02:22.065
and the doctor can't figure out why.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.100
So he wants to send some moron over

02:24.167 --> 02:26.134
to find the source of my stress.

02:26.202 --> 02:28.603
And I said, "the source of my stress

02:28.670 --> 02:30.771
"is when you quacks try
to pad my medical bill."

02:30.839 --> 02:33.273
And then the machine went "beep"
and the appointment was over.

02:33.274 --> 02:35.874
You know, I don't know what
you're so worried about.

02:35.942 --> 02:37.542
They're just gonna blame me.

02:37.610 --> 02:39.176
Shrinks love to blame the wife.

02:39.244 --> 02:41.078
What do they know? They're barely doctors.

02:41.145 --> 02:42.979
A stuffed animal and a box of tissues

02:43.046 --> 02:44.780
could do their job.

02:45.251 --> 02:47.398
Why is Red so stressed?

02:47.969 --> 02:48.373
Huh,

02:48.910 --> 02:49.884
it's a mystery,

02:49.885 --> 02:54.692
just like when Nancy Drew had to figure out why
the man in the clock tower was so mean to his cat.

02:56.623 --> 02:57.580
And what did you found out?

02:57.582 --> 02:59.184
Oh, I don't know, books are too long.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074

03:30.599 --> 03:34.633
Hello, Wisconsin!

03:43.286 --> 03:46.721
Hi, I'm the stress management
specialist, Stuart...

03:46.789 --> 03:49.657
Sutcliffe. You played
tight end for the packers.

03:49.724 --> 03:51.959
Yeah, till I bent my knee sideways.

03:52.026 --> 03:54.594
Actually, that happened to
me in the school musical.

03:55.712 --> 03:57.546
Yeah, I was a dancing mushroom.

03:57.547 --> 04:01.016
Anyway, long story short...

04:03.152 --> 04:04.986
I finished the number.

04:06.588 --> 04:09.189
This is my son Eric.

04:09.257 --> 04:10.657
Oh, oh,

04:10.725 --> 04:14.427
and I am his loving, relaxing wife, kitty.

04:14.495 --> 04:16.362
How about that?

04:16.428 --> 04:18.764
A real live packer in the house.

04:18.832 --> 04:20.632
Ha ha ha ha.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.568
Well, I hope the fact
that you both love sports

04:23.636 --> 04:26.137
doesn't mean that anyone like,

04:26.205 --> 04:29.073
say, his wife would be judged unfairly.

04:29.141 --> 04:30.374
I mean, I love sports.

04:30.442 --> 04:34.144
So don't start me off with four strikes

04:34.211 --> 04:37.279
in the last quarter of the super series.

04:38.347 --> 04:40.781
No, no. Today I'm just a neutral observer

04:40.849 --> 04:43.084
with a degree in family
therapy and alcohol awareness.

04:43.085 --> 04:46.221
Oh, so, dad, you can
talk to him about sports,

04:46.288 --> 04:48.222
and, mom, you can talk
to him about drinking.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.257
Ha ha ha ha ha.

04:50.325 --> 04:52.926
Oh, pooh. I was instructed by the doctor

04:52.944 --> 04:55.077
to have the occasional medicinal cocktail.

04:55.145 --> 04:58.280
I have a note.

04:58.348 --> 05:01.817
Red, how do you feel
about kitty's drinking?

05:01.884 --> 05:05.686
Makes things easier.

05:05.754 --> 05:08.055
But drinking often adds a
lot of stress to a household.

05:08.123 --> 05:10.624
If you will excuse me,
I'd rather not stay here

05:10.691 --> 05:13.593
and listen to you blame me.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.828
Mother hater.

05:17.163 --> 05:19.096
Well, I hope nobody minds

05:19.164 --> 05:21.765
if I record today's session.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.700
Hey, this is your lucky day, son.

05:23.768 --> 05:25.603
They say the camera adds 15 pounds.

05:26.671 --> 05:28.705
Really?

05:28.772 --> 05:31.974
I heard it also adds a full head of hair.

05:37.997 --> 05:39.964
Hey, kitty. You busy?

05:40.032 --> 05:41.331
No.

05:41.398 --> 05:43.767
Red and I are just having
our marriage dissected

05:43.835 --> 05:45.734
by a teetotaling
know-it-all.

05:47.302 --> 05:49.136
Oh, then is now a good time

05:49.304 --> 05:52.539
to tell red I broke his chain saw?

05:52.607 --> 05:54.041
No. He'll be furious with you.

05:54.042 --> 05:58.278
Yes. He will be furious with you.

05:59.445 --> 06:01.013
Come with me.

06:01.014 --> 06:04.950
So then all the mushrooms jitterbugged...

06:07.720 --> 06:10.821
Stuart. Stuart.

06:10.889 --> 06:12.923
This is Bob, the stress causer,

06:12.991 --> 06:15.391
Bob broke red's chain saw.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.428
Bob, meet Stuart. Stuart, blame Bob.

06:19.495 --> 06:21.463
Red, how do you feel about Bob?

06:21.497 --> 06:22.864
Does he cause you stress?

06:22.931 --> 06:25.833
Not really. Bob's just kind
of goofy, like a cartoon.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.668
It's like living next to Elmer Fudd.

06:30.336 --> 06:32.270
That might be the nicest thing

06:32.338 --> 06:34.107
you've ever said about me.

06:34.108 --> 06:37.608
You wascal. Heh heh heh heh.

06:37.976 --> 06:40.143
Oh, so fine.

06:40.211 --> 06:41.844
Now you're best friends.

06:41.911 --> 06:44.949
Now everyone's all happy,
and I look like the crazy one

06:45.016 --> 06:48.285
just yelling and screaming in
the middle of the living room.

06:48.352 --> 06:50.186
Well, I am not the crazy one,

06:50.254 --> 06:52.187
even though I am yelling and screaming

06:52.255 --> 06:54.189
in the middle of the living room.

06:54.257 --> 06:56.224
Is that a camera?

06:56.292 --> 06:57.359
Yes.

06:57.426 --> 06:59.627
I'm recording today's session.

06:59.695 --> 07:02.397
Well, isn't that just
something I didn't know.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.065
?

07:06.133 --> 07:10.570
Michael, we got issued our cop sunglasses.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.071
I've been using 'em

07:12.139 --> 07:14.704
to scare the crap out
of civilians all day.

07:14.772 --> 07:17.373
Drop the records, punk!

07:17.441 --> 07:20.076
I wasn't stealing them.

07:20.143 --> 07:22.378
Yes, I was.

07:24.546 --> 07:26.213
Fez, this is Suzy Simpson.

07:26.231 --> 07:28.200
She and I are training to be cops.

07:28.208 --> 07:29.477
Oh, if there's more like
you at the police academy,

07:29.645 --> 07:31.946
that academy deserves an award.

07:32.013 --> 07:34.148
Academy award... that's funny.

07:36.018 --> 07:39.690
Yeah, Simpson's wanted to
be a cop for, like, forever.

07:39.757 --> 07:42.225
Yeah, it's because of the weapons mostly.

07:42.293 --> 07:44.227
I love things that make a lot of noise...

07:44.295 --> 07:46.696
Guns and boys.

07:46.764 --> 07:48.731
Well, then load me up, baby,

07:48.799 --> 07:51.100
cause I'm ready to go bang.

07:53.904 --> 07:56.905
Well, I'd better go. I've
gotta stop at the candy store.

07:56.973 --> 07:59.673
Wait. You like candy?

07:59.741 --> 08:02.342
Yeah, I'm out of good & plenty.

08:02.410 --> 08:04.211
It says on the box that there's plenty...

08:04.212 --> 08:05.479
But it's never enough.

08:05.547 --> 08:08.181
Jinx. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You owe me a coke!

08:12.616 --> 08:16.185
That is the woman I've been
searching for my whole life!

08:17.820 --> 08:19.754
Hey, do you want me to
see if she likes you?

08:19.822 --> 08:21.355
Kelso, we've been down that road.

08:21.423 --> 08:23.223
Just give me her address, some binoculars,

08:23.291 --> 08:25.058
and I'll handle the rest myself.

08:28.162 --> 08:29.596
Now while we're filming,

08:29.664 --> 08:33.399
let's just pretend the
camera's not even here.

08:36.302 --> 08:38.770
Now you're going to interact.

08:38.837 --> 08:40.671
I'm gonna write down my observations.

08:40.739 --> 08:42.773
While you're writing down stuff,

08:42.841 --> 08:44.774
would you mind autographing this football?

08:44.842 --> 08:47.243
It's brand-new. Kid never touched it.

08:49.479 --> 08:51.179
Hey, what's going on?

08:51.247 --> 08:53.381
Dude, we're on tv.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.750
How does this thing work?

08:55.818 --> 08:59.087
Hey, Steven, point it at me.

08:59.155 --> 09:01.489
Good morning, Dallas.

09:01.556 --> 09:04.958
I'm Jackie sunshine with
your morning weather.

09:05.026 --> 09:06.960
It is going to be sunny today.

09:07.028 --> 09:09.262
So you ladies who let
yourself go this winter,

09:09.330 --> 09:10.830
stay inside

09:10.898 --> 09:13.333
and leave the fellas to us pretty girls.

09:13.401 --> 09:15.601
Please stop touching my camera.

09:17.804 --> 09:20.506
Well, what a lovy day here

09:20.574 --> 09:22.674
in the household of the Formans.

09:22.742 --> 09:24.876
I can't say there's a place I'd rather be

09:24.944 --> 09:27.012
than with these kinds of people

09:27.080 --> 09:29.014
in this kind of place.

09:29.082 --> 09:31.016
What are you, Scarlett O'Hara now?

09:31.083 --> 09:33.017
I am being soft and gracious.

09:33.085 --> 09:34.853
Now clam it!

09:34.920 --> 09:38.590
Mom, you know, they have talkies now.

09:39.659 --> 09:41.993
Oh, forget it. I give up.

09:42.061 --> 09:43.962
Where is the "off" button on this thing?

09:44.030 --> 09:46.831
Mrs. Forman, I need to
see things as they happen!

09:49.068 --> 09:51.236
All right, you clocked this lady

09:51.303 --> 09:53.937
doin' 38 in a 35 zone.

09:54.005 --> 09:55.939
Recite it and write it.

09:56.007 --> 10:00.175
License and registration, ma'am.

10:00.243 --> 10:03.043
Use the glasses. They're powerful.

10:03.111 --> 10:05.344
It's like a gun you wear on your face.

10:07.111 --> 10:10.180
License and registration, ma'am.

10:10.247 --> 10:11.681
Ooh, that felt good.

10:11.749 --> 10:14.350
Hey, guess what.

10:14.418 --> 10:16.953
I know someone who likes you

10:17.020 --> 10:19.521
and thinks that you're
cute and smart and funny.

10:19.589 --> 10:22.557
Ah. Well, I think I know
who you're talking about,

10:22.625 --> 10:24.225
and I like him, too.

10:24.293 --> 10:26.327
Huh? What do you like about him?

10:26.395 --> 10:28.796
I like how hot he looks
sitting across from me

10:28.863 --> 10:31.764
I n a blue t-shirt eating a hot dog.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.834
You just described me.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.739
Oh, crap.

10:50.237 --> 10:52.163
Man, I thought Simpson was different.

10:52.164 --> 10:54.164
She's supposed to just be my buddy.

10:54.231 --> 10:57.499
Now I'm gonna have to sleep with her.

10:57.567 --> 11:00.102
No, Michael, no. Set her up with fez.

11:00.169 --> 11:02.170
He's the one who likes her.

11:02.171 --> 11:03.605
Fez needs something, man.

11:03.672 --> 11:05.606
Guy's so desperate,
he's been rubbing himself

11:05.674 --> 11:07.474
around on the couch like a cat.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.909
What you need to do

11:09.977 --> 11:12.078
is put 'em together in
a romantic situation.

11:12.145 --> 11:14.080
Suzy might not like fez at first,

11:14.147 --> 11:15.815
but he won't take "no" for an answer.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.550
He's like one freaky, horny little dude.

11:18.618 --> 11:21.854
Just ask the couch.

11:23.256 --> 11:25.325
Hey, I was thinking maybe tomorrow

11:25.393 --> 11:27.426
you could help me brush
up on my target practice.

11:27.494 --> 11:29.195
It's a date.

11:29.263 --> 11:31.696
Yeah, I'll be there. You'll be there.

11:31.764 --> 11:33.198
On a date.

11:33.265 --> 11:35.232
So I'll see you at the shooting range.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.867
For our date.

11:38.335 --> 11:40.102
Your first date with Suzy's all set up,

11:40.170 --> 11:42.872
and she told me that
she's crazy about you.

11:42.939 --> 11:44.874
Well, I'd like to say I'm surprised,

11:44.941 --> 11:47.642
but I'm a little crazy about me, too.

11:48.844 --> 11:50.379
Well, it's all set.

11:50.446 --> 11:51.581
Fez is going on a date with Suzy,

11:51.600 --> 11:53.034
who's going on a date with me

11:53.047 --> 11:54.681
and doesn't know she's
going on a date with fez.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.732
I'm ready for our date, Michael.

11:56.733 --> 11:59.266
I'm ready for our date, Suzy.

11:59.833 --> 12:03.302
Oh, yeah!

12:03.370 --> 12:05.871
?

12:05.939 --> 12:08.806
it's such a shame you won't
be able to film anymore.

12:10.308 --> 12:13.744
Look, there's one last
exercise I want to try...

12:13.812 --> 12:15.345
Role-playing.

12:15.413 --> 12:17.280
All right, come on.

12:17.347 --> 12:20.049
All right, now you're going to be Eric.

12:20.117 --> 12:22.119
Eric, you're going to be your father.

12:22.187 --> 12:25.756
Mr. Forman, you can start.

12:28.058 --> 12:30.492
Well...

12:30.560 --> 12:33.761
I'm just a skinny...

12:33.828 --> 12:36.329
Smart-mouthed kid

12:36.397 --> 12:40.599
who always has something
to say about everything.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.968
And I wish I was an octopus.

12:45.470 --> 12:48.405
So I could put eight feet
in eight different asses.

12:51.642 --> 12:53.943
"Star wars." "Star wars."

12:54.011 --> 12:55.211
"Star wars"!

12:55.278 --> 12:58.081
Dead commies! Dead commies! Dead commies!

12:58.148 --> 13:01.016
All right, hold it. Time out. Time out.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.618
I think I know what the problem is.

13:03.686 --> 13:06.920
All right, fine. I drink a little.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.556
What?

13:10.624 --> 13:12.891
I have a very difficult job,

13:12.959 --> 13:16.260
and I come home at night, and, well...

13:16.328 --> 13:18.863
Drinks are her nightly reward.

13:18.931 --> 13:22.969
Mrs. Forman, I believe the source

13:23.037 --> 13:24.739
of your husband's stress is...

13:24.807 --> 13:26.674
Oh, here it comes.

13:26.742 --> 13:28.675
Your son!

13:28.676 --> 13:30.478
Him? Me?

13:30.545 --> 13:34.181
It's not me? Oh, boy!

13:36.151 --> 13:39.856
You think my problem is my own son?

13:39.924 --> 13:43.494
My son is a fine young man.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.496
Oh, dad, you don't have...

13:45.564 --> 13:47.831
Shut up, dumb-ass.

13:51.002 --> 13:53.737
You know less about my family
than you do about football,

13:53.805 --> 13:55.539
which isn't saying much

13:55.607 --> 13:58.376
since you dropped every
pass that came near you.

13:58.443 --> 14:01.112
And let me tell you something else...

14:01.180 --> 14:03.648
When a real packer hurts his leg,

14:03.716 --> 14:08.020
he stuffs his kneecap back
in and keeps on running!

14:09.422 --> 14:13.960
That's what this little
mushroom would have done.

14:14.028 --> 14:19.897
?

14:20.966 --> 14:23.298
I love this place...

14:23.366 --> 14:25.800
The sweet smell of gunpowder,

14:25.867 --> 14:29.506
the deafening boom of shotgun blasts.

14:29.574 --> 14:32.308
Oops, that kind of
talk is more appropriate

14:32.375 --> 14:33.974
for the bedroom. I apologize.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.478
Knock. Knock.

14:38.981 --> 14:41.349
Who's there? Ivan. Ivan who?

14:41.417 --> 14:43.918
I've an awful lot of
candy for the both of us.

14:45.253 --> 14:46.587
Fez?

14:46.655 --> 14:47.954
Well, if it's not me,

14:48.022 --> 14:51.325
then there's some lucky
bastard who looks just like me.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.363
Michael, I thought it
was just gonna be you, me,

14:55.431 --> 14:57.431
and a box of hot lead.

14:57.499 --> 14:58.931
Well, it's even better.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.333
It's you, me, and a box of hot fez.

15:04.135 --> 15:07.103
Kelso, this wasn't part of the deal.

15:07.171 --> 15:09.405
What wasn't part of the deal?

15:09.473 --> 15:11.573
You! So beat it.

15:11.641 --> 15:14.042
I want her to smell nothing but me.

15:14.110 --> 15:17.445
Okay, you know what?
I'm kind of in the way.

15:17.513 --> 15:18.947
I'm gonna go next door,

15:19.014 --> 15:21.048
and maybe you can show fez how to shoot.

15:21.116 --> 15:24.985
Try to close the deal before
she realizes you're a foreigner.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.956
So where do we start?

15:30.024 --> 15:31.958
I could rifle through the manual,

15:32.025 --> 15:34.927
but why don't you just
give me the bullet points?

15:34.995 --> 15:39.798
Fez, I never joke about guns.

15:39.866 --> 15:43.501
Oh...Shoot.

15:45.371 --> 15:48.140
I have no discipline.

15:48.207 --> 15:49.941
Okay.

15:50.009 --> 15:53.077
You're gonna just take aim

15:53.145 --> 15:56.178
and squeeze gently.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.549
Squeebee-geegee.

16:02.984 --> 16:05.452
Here. Put these on and take a few shots.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.988
I'm just gonna go check on Michael.

16:08.055 --> 16:09.289
So he's not alone.

16:09.356 --> 16:11.357
Cologne?

16:11.425 --> 16:14.492
Oh, yeah, I mixed a
bunch of different ones,

16:14.560 --> 16:16.594
and, you know, I make my own scent.

16:22.133 --> 16:25.102
Hey, Michael. Do you want
me to hold your shoulders

16:25.169 --> 16:29.338
while you shoot or maybe
square off your thighs?

16:31.541 --> 16:34.576
You know whose thighs need squaring off?

16:34.644 --> 16:36.111
Fez's.

16:36.179 --> 16:37.345
Yeah, bad.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.647
Oh, and by the way,

16:39.715 --> 16:41.715
he also told me that he
thinks you're really nice.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.118
Oh, well, he's nice, too.

16:44.186 --> 16:46.253
And now that I can understand
some of what he's saying,

16:46.321 --> 16:48.422
he's kind of charming.

16:49.724 --> 16:52.325
Oh, look, a rabbit.

16:52.393 --> 16:54.627
I love animals.

16:54.695 --> 16:57.862
You know who really loves animals?

16:57.930 --> 16:59.029
Fez.

16:59.097 --> 17:00.130
He does? Yeah.

17:01.365 --> 17:04.367
The bunny!

17:10.941 --> 17:13.242
I got dinner!

17:14.711 --> 17:16.913
?

17:16.981 --> 17:20.517
and then my dad actually
gave me a compliment...

17:20.584 --> 17:23.118
"My son's a fine young man."

17:28.492 --> 17:30.761
That's like the most
loving thing he said to me

17:30.829 --> 17:34.164
since he told me that I could be worse.

17:35.799 --> 17:38.967
Are you sure red was talking about you?

17:39.035 --> 17:40.702
I mean, I love you,

17:40.770 --> 17:43.938
but you are a little high-maintenance.

17:44.006 --> 17:47.341
And not in a good way like me.

17:48.576 --> 17:50.510
Remember when it took red all summer

17:50.578 --> 17:52.545
to teach you how to catch a ball

17:52.613 --> 17:54.146
'cause you were too scared of it?

17:54.213 --> 17:56.781
First, red had him look
at a picture of a ball.

17:56.848 --> 17:59.449
Then he put him in a room with a ball.

17:59.517 --> 18:02.051
And then he moves him closer
until he wasn't screaming

18:02.118 --> 18:04.285
being right next to the ball.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.320
What is so scary about a ball?

18:07.388 --> 18:10.523
People throw it right at you, okay?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.861
I'm sorry about what I
did to that poor bunny.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.933
I guess my gun really
had a hare trigger, huh?

18:22.136 --> 18:24.571
Too soon? Yes, too soon.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.607
Well, I apologize for
ruining our first date.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.676
Our first date?

18:30.743 --> 18:32.846
No, I was there on a date with Michael.

18:32.914 --> 18:34.983
What? No, no, he told
me we were on a date.

18:35.050 --> 18:37.451
He told me we were on a date.

18:37.519 --> 18:40.453
You and me "we" or he and you "we"?

18:40.521 --> 18:43.523
I think one of us has been lied to

18:43.590 --> 18:46.058
and the other one, too.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.059
Well, then you should be very angry,

18:48.127 --> 18:52.095
which means I am, too!

18:52.162 --> 18:55.498
Hey, why don't you two kiss and make up?

18:55.565 --> 18:57.868
Michael, what kind of
game are you playing,

18:57.936 --> 19:00.037
inviting me on a date
that wasn't with you?

19:00.105 --> 19:04.074
Yeah, I second that, but about her.

19:04.141 --> 19:07.711
And add, "you son of bitch."

19:10.047 --> 19:12.848
Okay, look, I have a really
good explanation for this,

19:12.915 --> 19:15.083
but I left it at home.

19:18.387 --> 19:20.388
Oh, dad.

19:20.455 --> 19:22.690
Uh, about what you said to
the stress management guy...

19:22.757 --> 19:24.691
I just wanted to say thanks.

19:24.758 --> 19:26.326
Okay. Okay.

19:26.393 --> 19:28.327
You said it. We're both embarrassed.

19:28.395 --> 19:30.362
Now move along.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.464
No, I mean...

19:32.532 --> 19:34.466
Look, I could be a little
less of a smart-ass.

19:34.534 --> 19:38.935
And you're my father.
Your life matters to me.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.636
So anyway, dad, I...

19:40.704 --> 19:42.871
Eric, if you say, "I love you,"

19:42.939 --> 19:45.139
my heart is going to explode.

19:46.975 --> 19:50.810
Ah, kitty, uh, what's for dinner?

19:50.878 --> 19:52.378
Well, the camera's off,

19:52.446 --> 19:55.816
so I'm having a Margarita with salt.

19:55.883 --> 19:58.754
You two are on your own.

20:04.962 --> 20:07.964
Kelso...

20:08.032 --> 20:10.700
So this is where you go after a hard day

20:10.768 --> 20:13.002
of screwing me over!

20:14.371 --> 20:16.705
All right, look, fez, I'm really sorry.

20:16.772 --> 20:19.574
Zip it, fool!

20:19.642 --> 20:23.244
You stole my girl, and
I really need a girl.

20:23.312 --> 20:25.380
Here, fez. You're probably gonna want

20:25.447 --> 20:28.516
some personal time with the couch.

20:28.584 --> 20:31.351
I even plumped up the pillows for you.

20:31.418 --> 20:35.321
No, I cannot be in the same room with him.

20:35.389 --> 20:37.690
You and I are through.

20:37.757 --> 20:40.491
Now good day.

20:40.559 --> 20:42.393
But, fez...

20:49.233 --> 20:51.534
Fez, he said, "but, fez..."

20:51.602 --> 20:54.638
Oh, I heard him.

20:54.706 --> 20:56.638
Well, now you're supposed to say...

20:56.706 --> 20:59.605
"I say good day."

21:01.874 --> 21:03.809
Yeah, and then we all know
that you're really mad,

21:03.876 --> 21:05.343
but eventually, you'll get over it.

21:05.411 --> 21:07.345
Oh, you'd like that.

21:07.413 --> 21:09.748
Dance, monkey, dance.

21:11.184 --> 21:14.853
Oh, kelso, this monkey
don't dance no more.

21:14.920 --> 21:14.953
But, fez...

21:14.954 --> 21:16.989
I said good day! Arrrh!

21:26.757 --> 21:29.192
Oh, fez, it was so nice of
you to make dinner for us.

21:29.259 --> 21:30.526
Yeah, this is amazing.

21:30.594 --> 21:33.262
Well, food always tastes
better when it's fresh.

21:37.933 --> 21:39.667
So what is this anyway?

21:39.734 --> 21:41.701
Well, let's just say that the Easter bunny

21:41.769 --> 21:44.370
came early this year,

21:44.438 --> 21:45.437
so I shot him.
