00:00.583 --> 00:02.250
(J.D.) <i>Today I walk in here</i>
<i>not as a resident</i>

00:02.333 --> 00:04.625
<i>but as chief--</i>
<i>chief resident.</i>

00:04.709 --> 00:07.583
<i>Chief resident Dorian.</i>
<i>Chiefy-chiefy-chief.</i>

00:07.667 --> 00:10.250
What's that,
your new cool guy walk?

00:10.333 --> 00:13.667
No. I have rocks
in my shoe.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.667
(J.D.) <i>Wow!</i>
<i>That's a lot of rocks!</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:18.667
<i>I gotta stop taking that</i>
<i>shortcut through the quarry.</i>

00:18.750 --> 00:20.625
<i>Anyway, the best thing</i>
<i>about my new job</i>

00:20.709 --> 00:22.875
<i>is that I command</i>
<i>a lot more respect.</i>

00:22.959 --> 00:26.542
Chief resident in the house.
Everybody say, "hey!"

00:26.625 --> 00:28.417
Hey!

00:28.500 --> 00:30.667
(J.D.) <i>Even though Councilman Donovan</i>
<i>was handcuffed to that chair</i>

00:30.750 --> 00:33.709
<i>because once again he was</i>
<i>flying high on crystal meth,</i>

00:33.792 --> 00:35.417
<i>his respect felt good.</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:37.417
<i>Honestly, it's the reason</i>
<i>I keep voting for him.</i>

00:37.500 --> 00:38.542
Have a good day.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.208
Try not to torture
anyone so much

00:40.291 --> 00:42.583
-that they take their own lives.
-I'll try.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.458
You know, you're not
looking as processed

00:44.542 --> 00:46.125
and overly-medicated
as usual.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.291
That is so sweet.

00:48.375 --> 00:51.208
(J.D.) <i>It was the same old</i>
<i>Dr. Cox and Jordan.</i>

00:51.291 --> 00:53.542
<i>The weird thing was,</i>
<i>there was something underneath it.</i>

00:53.625 --> 00:54.875
They were happy.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.333
We have some
very exciting news.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.959
Don't tell me. You and sweaty Teddy
here are gonna

01:01.041 --> 01:03.625
finally have that commitment ceremony
you've been dreaming about?

01:03.709 --> 01:05.250
Perry, even if I went that way,

01:05.333 --> 01:06.917
and believe me,
there were nights in the service

01:07.000 --> 01:08.417
when it didn't sound so farfetched,

01:08.500 --> 01:09.792
Ted is hardly my type.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.000
I beg to differ. I've seen Enid.

01:12.083 --> 01:13.208
-What?
-Nothing.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.834
Dr. Cox, remember
a few years back,

01:15.917 --> 01:18.250
you asked me to look over
your divorce papers.

01:18.333 --> 01:22.417
To make sure "that slag would die
a penniless whore"?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.208
-Hmm?
-Sorry.

01:25.291 --> 01:29.125
It's okay. Slag is kind of
his pet name for me.

01:29.208 --> 01:32.417
Anyway, I was
also going through a divorce.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.542
She's with my brother now.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.291
He's nine inches shorter than me,

01:36.375 --> 01:38.166
but he wears a piece.

01:38.250 --> 01:42.458
The point is, you and I signed
the wrong papers,

01:42.542 --> 01:45.041
which technically means
you two are still married

01:45.125 --> 01:46.750
and so am I.

01:46.834 --> 01:50.709
Well, <i>mazel tovs </i>all around.

01:50.792 --> 01:53.625
(J.D.) <i>I'd never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan</i>
<i>speechless before.</i>

01:53.709 --> 01:55.917
<i>It was neato.</i>

01:56.000 --> 01:58.500
Just so you know,
I think this chief resident thing

01:58.583 --> 02:00.709
has made you a little too big
for your britches,

02:00.792 --> 02:04.250
so from now on, I'm gonna be your
britches shrinker.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.667
(snap)

02:05.750 --> 02:07.750
Oh, what? Is that supposed to
intimidate me or something?

02:07.834 --> 02:09.583
No. I had to do it anyway.

02:09.667 --> 02:12.625
What possible reason could you have
for breaking a broom in half?

02:15.959 --> 02:17.750
Thanks, bro.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.917
Any other questions, smart guy?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.458
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

02:24.542 --> 02:27.709
<i>♪ No, I know, I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:31.250 --> 02:32.875
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:36.709 --> 02:38.792
Boo-sha, ladies.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.458
Ha ha hey!

02:40.542 --> 02:41.792
Ohh!

02:43.125 --> 02:44.917
What's up with these rocks?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.166
Ha! You've been graveled!

02:47.250 --> 02:48.250
Graveled?

02:48.333 --> 02:50.834
Yeah, it's a new game I made up
this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.125
I like it.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.709
Better than play-doh pants?

02:54.792 --> 02:56.625
Play-doh pants became
all about the money.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.291
Wise.

02:58.375 --> 02:59.583
(J.D.) <i>It felt good</i>
<i>cheering Turk up.</i>

02:59.667 --> 03:00.959
<i>See, now that</i>
<i>I'm chief studly</i>

03:01.041 --> 03:02.750
<i>I was making a lot</i>
<i>more money than him.</i>

03:02.834 --> 03:05.667
<i>Needless to say, it was a time</i>
<i>to be extra sensitive.</i>

03:05.750 --> 03:07.208
Hey, remember how I make
more money than you now?

03:07.291 --> 03:09.166
Yeah. Here's 5 bucks
for a memory.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.375
Anyway, I was thinking about spending
some of my extra ducats

03:11.458 --> 03:13.542
on one of those classy suits
we always wanted.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.750
You mean the leather
purple jumpsuit

03:15.834 --> 03:16.834
Eddie Murphy wore in <i>Raw?</i>

03:16.917 --> 03:17.917
You know it, dawg.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.333
That's cold.
Look, I gotta go.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.667
I got a new attending and he hates it when
we're late. Plus he's a question talker.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.458
What's a question talker?

03:25.542 --> 03:29.125
Do I want you to be on time,
Dr. Turk? Yes, I do.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.542
Am I going to remember this?
Of course I am.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.667
Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages
removed now.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.166
You mean
dashboard face?

03:38.250 --> 03:40.417
Yeah, I think
she prefers Miss Myers.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.709
Well, then she probably shouldn't be
checking her e-mail

03:42.792 --> 03:44.208
while she's driving
90 miles an hour.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.500
Hey, sorry, I'm late.

03:45.583 --> 03:46.709
We weren't
waiting for you.

03:46.792 --> 03:49.250
Great, I'm on time.
See, I think that as a psychiatrist

03:49.333 --> 03:51.375
I should be there when Miss Myers'
bandages get removed,

03:51.458 --> 03:53.709
because her accident
was traumatic enough,

03:53.792 --> 03:56.625
but with reconstructive
facial surgery on top of that?

03:56.709 --> 03:58.875
In my professional opinion, "yikes!"

03:58.959 --> 04:02.250
If you are coming in, I just might go
ahead and phone up my pool man

04:02.333 --> 04:04.083
and my architect
so we could populate the room

04:04.166 --> 04:06.166
with just as many
useless people as possible.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.291
Great! My mom's in town.
Should I call her?

04:08.375 --> 04:10.583
Ha ha! Ohh...

04:10.667 --> 04:13.083
Ha ha ha! That was good.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.834
Okay, Miss Myers,

04:15.917 --> 04:17.917
I'm gonna go ahead
and get these bandages off

04:18.000 --> 04:19.291
and make sure
the plastic surgeons

04:19.375 --> 04:21.709
have left your face just as beautiful
as it always was.

04:21.792 --> 04:24.875
You're so nice.
Are you married?

04:24.959 --> 04:27.417
Oh, he is as of this morning.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.917
Really? I thought
he was divorced.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.834
No, child, the papers
didn't go through.

04:30.917 --> 04:33.291
You know what?
I've got a son,

04:33.375 --> 04:36.709
I don't fantasize about Jordan
dying as much anymore,

04:36.792 --> 04:39.792
and even though it wasn't planned,
I'm actually pretty happy

04:39.875 --> 04:41.959
about the way this whole marriage thing
has worked out,

04:42.041 --> 04:44.333
so would you please
stop your chirping

04:44.417 --> 04:46.417
and step away from my personal life?

04:46.500 --> 04:47.542
So what's his wife like?

04:47.625 --> 04:50.041
(Carla) Scary.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.583
You go ahead and
have a look there.

04:53.917 --> 04:55.041
Wow.

04:55.125 --> 04:59.250
You look fantastic.
You do. Doctor?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.291
Really fantastic.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.667
Thank God
you were here.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.458
(J.D.) <i>Since Elliot and I</i>
<i>are both chief residents</i>

05:09.542 --> 05:11.333
<i>I'm trying not</i>
<i>to make it all about me.</i>

05:11.417 --> 05:12.709
John Dorian, chief resident.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.625
(J.D.) <i>You know, unless</i>
<i>it's someone I could doink.</i>

05:15.709 --> 05:17.458
Hey, you need to move your car.

05:17.542 --> 05:18.625
It's my day to have the parking spot.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.041
J.D., you have a scooter.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.250
Why do you even
need a parking spot?

05:22.792 --> 05:23.959
It sends a message.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.250
(J.D.) <i>Just because I lured her away</i>

05:25.333 --> 05:27.041
<i>from her perfect boyfriend,</i>
<i>and then dumped her</i>

05:27.125 --> 05:29.834
<i>doesn't mean my scooter</i>
<i>"Sasha" needs to suffer.</i>

05:29.917 --> 05:31.792
-(tapping)
-What are you doing?

05:31.875 --> 05:36.166
Just making it official.
Chief. Co-chief.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.917
Now, you can try as hard as you want,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.041
that is never gonna stick.

05:39.125 --> 05:39.959
Hmm.

05:40.041 --> 05:43.250
Oh, and that's co-chief resident
Dorian over there.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.542
Damn it! You are quick.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.375
Damn it, I got
an appendectomy again?

05:51.458 --> 05:55.583
Sweet! I get the duwa...Do-oh--

05:55.667 --> 05:58.583
Duodenojejunostomy, man.
What's wrong with you?

05:58.667 --> 06:00.375
So I can't pronounce it.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.333
Try and be a little
more sensitive, okay?

06:02.417 --> 06:05.166
New bra, Janice?
'Cause it's working.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.000
Besides, the only reason
I'm getting all these great procedures

06:08.083 --> 06:10.417
is because nobody's died on me
in, like, three months.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.709
Listen, man, you never have to apologize
for being on a hot streak.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.417
I'm psyched for you,
and I wouldn't take

06:15.500 --> 06:17.125
those procedures away if I could.

06:17.208 --> 06:22.333
Sir, would you mind giving me the
duodenojejunostomy instead of the Todd?

06:22.417 --> 06:25.041
Am I impressed by your moxie?
You betcha.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.208
Am I going to reward it?
Not a chance.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.250
This Todd thing is killing me.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.000
Where's your lunch?

06:32.083 --> 06:34.291
Ahh, thank you, Barry.

06:34.375 --> 06:37.041
Hey! That's for Barry, Jr.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.291
What? The little guy's
in leg braces.

06:41.750 --> 06:42.834
-Hi.
-Hey.

06:43.750 --> 06:47.208
I visited my safety deposit box today.
Guess what I found?

06:47.291 --> 06:48.625
My grandfather's purple heart?

06:49.333 --> 06:51.667
Please. I sold that years ago
to pay for these.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.750
-Oh.
-Yeah.

06:53.834 --> 06:54.959
Our wedding rings.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.583
-Holy cow.
-What do you think?

06:58.667 --> 07:01.709
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life.

07:03.458 --> 07:04.750
(J.D.) <i>Of course, marriage can make</i>

07:04.834 --> 07:06.959
<i>the rest of your life</i>
<i>seem much longer.</i>

07:07.041 --> 07:09.041
So you're just going to
fall asleep right after

07:09.125 --> 07:11.792
for the rest of my life?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.834
(sighs)

07:13.917 --> 07:16.959
So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox
the rest of my life?

07:23.542 --> 07:25.291
I'm not sure I want
to watch you drink a beer

07:25.375 --> 07:27.375
while I'm holding the baby
for the rest of my life.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.583
(belches)

07:30.750 --> 07:33.125
Look, Attila, there's no way in hell
that I'm gonna listen

07:33.208 --> 07:34.709
to you complain about
the rest of your life

07:34.792 --> 07:36.500
for the rest of my life,
you got that?

07:36.583 --> 07:39.458
Yeah, not listening. By the way,
now that we're married again,

07:39.542 --> 07:42.166
we've got to make out new wills
in case one of us dies.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.375
Oh, God, I hope it's me.

07:44.458 --> 07:47.750
(J.D.) <i>Yep, there was definitely</i>
<i>trouble in paradise.</i>

07:47.834 --> 07:50.583
(P.A.) <i>Would co-chief Dorian</i>
<i>please report to the ICU?</i>

07:50.667 --> 07:54.542
<i>Co-chief Dorian. The co-chief.</i>

07:54.625 --> 07:58.375
Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT scan
showed a small rectal tumor,

07:58.458 --> 08:00.709
so I want to schedule
a low anterior resection.

08:00.792 --> 08:04.000
But don't worry. We have an amazing
surgical team here, okay?

08:04.083 --> 08:08.542
That means a lot,
coming from the co-chief resident.

08:08.625 --> 08:09.667
Ha!

08:09.750 --> 08:12.792
(J.D.) <i>How did she hear?</i>
<i>She's been in a coma for two weeks!</i>

08:12.875 --> 08:14.458
Hey, buddy, can I talk
to you for a second?

08:14.542 --> 08:16.625
-Sure.
-I know the Todd's doing her resection,

08:16.709 --> 08:19.500
but if you send her down right now,
he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.792
What's the Todd doing?

08:20.875 --> 08:23.083
You know the city surveyors
outside taking pictures

08:23.166 --> 08:24.667
of the hospital for the zoning commission?

08:24.750 --> 08:25.542
Yeah?

08:25.625 --> 08:28.166
I told him they were shooting
a Sacred Heart calendar.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.959
Gentlemen, say hello to June!

08:31.625 --> 08:33.375
(exhaling)

08:35.208 --> 08:37.333
How about a sneak peek at July?

08:39.125 --> 08:42.083
I don't know, Turk. It's a little early
for me to start pulling strings.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.166
I just got this co-chief job.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.500
Damn it, now I'm saying it.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.583
Come on, man,
get me back in the game.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.458
Mmm, okay.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.792
Ha ha ha!
Okay, okay!

08:51.875 --> 08:54.709
You know what, here's 10 bucks
for letting me help you out.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.417
Spend it wisely.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.041
I think she's a little upset
she doesn't look the way she used to.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.875
Why? How did
she used to look?

09:07.959 --> 09:09.125
Hmm?
Oh, dear ugly.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.667
(beeping)

09:10.750 --> 09:13.417
Oh, what do you know?
It's the paging of the shrew.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.542
Look, why don't you just talk to her?

09:14.625 --> 09:15.875
Mm-hmm. Why don't you just--

09:15.959 --> 09:17.000
Mind my own business. I know.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.959
Your life is your life and
it's not my job to fix it,

09:19.041 --> 09:20.083
unless of course
you ask me to,

09:20.166 --> 09:22.291
and, man, when I get in there,
because I'm a good shrink,

09:22.375 --> 09:25.000
and you, my friend,
are a walking disaster.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.291
Shall we?

09:29.500 --> 09:32.542
So, now, Miss Myers,
how are you feeling?

09:33.125 --> 09:36.750
I was wondering if it were possible
to have surgery again.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.250
(cell phone rings)

09:38.333 --> 09:39.750
Hi, sweetie. I'm in a tunnel.

09:39.834 --> 09:42.667
Look, your body's been through
an enormous amount of trauma

09:42.750 --> 09:45.041
and I can't recommend
you go racing back into surgery.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.417
Now, I guarantee
if you just give it time,

09:47.500 --> 09:48.542
you'll be happy with the way you look.

09:48.625 --> 09:51.166
-(ring)
-Oh, my God.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.583
What?!

09:53.667 --> 09:55.917
I just don't look like myself.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.834
I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes,

09:57.917 --> 10:00.917
but they were my nose
and my droopy eyes, you know?

10:02.959 --> 10:04.417
Tell me more about yourself.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
(J.D.) <i>Around here,</i>
<i>there's always at least</i>

10:06.583 --> 10:08.750
<i>one person that'll</i>
<i>come through for you.</i>

10:13.125 --> 10:16.333
<i>In Turk's case, that was me.</i>

10:16.417 --> 10:18.583
Hey, Elliot!

10:18.667 --> 10:21.542
Hey, I want to talk to you about this
whole chief resident thing.

10:21.625 --> 10:22.542
What about it?

10:22.625 --> 10:24.083
Well, as you may have heard

10:24.166 --> 10:27.417
from the loud speaker,
some residents, the janitor,

10:27.500 --> 10:30.458
my mother, your mother,
and a coma patient,

10:30.542 --> 10:33.917
I'm being referred to as
the co-chief resident.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.208
I think we should either
both go with co-chief

10:37.291 --> 10:40.625
or chief, don't you co-agree?

10:40.709 --> 10:44.166
Excuse me, we're working up this patient
for a hyper-coagulable state

10:44.250 --> 10:46.792
with a prolonged PTT.
What's our next step?

10:46.875 --> 10:48.750
That's easy, Lonnie.
What you want to do--

10:48.834 --> 10:51.583
I'd like my answer
from the chief resident.

10:51.667 --> 10:56.166
We're both chief residents.
Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?

10:58.166 --> 11:01.125
With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do
a one to one mixing study.

11:02.917 --> 11:05.250
That's why she's the chief
and you're the co-chief.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.375
Shut up, Lonnie!

11:06.458 --> 11:07.750
You shut up!

11:09.917 --> 11:11.500
Well, obviously for your ex-wife,

11:11.583 --> 11:14.959
just the illusion of hair is important.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.792
Excuse me.

11:16.875 --> 11:20.166
So you're saying it had nothing to do
with my impotence?

11:20.250 --> 11:23.333
Dr. Cox, I was wondering if we could
talk about Miss Myers in my office.

11:23.417 --> 11:26.041
Yeah, I make it a point
to never enter a shrink's office

11:26.125 --> 11:28.250
unless I'm planning on grossly
over-paying somebody

11:28.333 --> 11:30.083
for telling me something
that I already know.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.709
Look, you're obviously really distracted
by the situation with your marriage.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.917
Something I already know.
What do I owe? Will 10 bucks cover it?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.166
-Oh, yeah!
-Are you gonna hang onto that?!

11:37.250 --> 11:38.583
Yeah, I forgot my lunch money.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.417
It's kielbasa day in the cafeteria.
Kielbasa!

11:40.500 --> 11:41.458
-Ha!
-Love it!

11:41.542 --> 11:43.125
Anyway, Miss Myers really
values your opinion,

11:43.208 --> 11:45.291
but I don't think you're even trying
to understand how she feels.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.792
Look, if I ever want your advice
on one of my patients,

11:48.875 --> 11:51.166
I'll ask, but do not hold your breath,

11:51.250 --> 11:54.083
unless of course you can hold it
for a really long, long,

11:54.166 --> 11:58.667
long, long, long, long, long, long,
long, long, long time.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.250
I can't. I used to smoke.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.875
Kielbasa. Yes!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.166
Let me buy you lunch.

12:08.250 --> 12:12.208
I'm rich. I'll buy you lunch
and some gold teeth to eat it with.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.792
You know, you only got
one more black joke

12:13.875 --> 12:15.417
this month
before I bust your ass.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.834
Damn it! I used them all up
watching <i>Barbershop 9.</i>

12:17.917 --> 12:19.709
Okay, that's it,
and I'll get you later.

12:19.792 --> 12:20.959
How'd surgery go?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.375
Well, you know,
I was on top of my game.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.625
(J.D.) <i>It can be scary</i>
<i>to stick your neck out for a friend.</i>

12:24.709 --> 12:26.417
<i>That's why it's a huge relief</i>
<i>when they come through.</i>

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
How's she doing?

12:27.583 --> 12:31.041
Uh...unfortunately,
she didn't make it.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.375
(J.D.) <i>What?</i>

12:38.750 --> 12:40.083
What do you mean she died?

12:40.166 --> 12:42.125
J.D., I did everything I could.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.667
Even my attending
thought I did great.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.834
He said, "do I think you did great?
Yes, I do."

12:45.917 --> 12:48.667
(J.D.) <i>I couldn't help wonder</i>
<i>if by taking that patient from Todd</i>

12:48.750 --> 12:51.208
<i>and giving her to Turk</i>
<i>I had toyed with fate.</i>

12:51.291 --> 12:53.000
I know that look.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.792
You're wondering if
you toyed with fate.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.291
How could you know that look?
It's a brand-new look!

12:57.375 --> 13:00.125
What do you think Todd
would have done that I didn't?

13:00.208 --> 13:02.333
Doctor, her heart stopped.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.834
(grunting)

13:04.917 --> 13:06.959
Aah! Here!

13:07.041 --> 13:10.125
(gasping) I'm gay!

13:10.208 --> 13:11.458
(crash)

13:11.542 --> 13:12.834
I knew it.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.709
Oh, my God! That's your "the Todd
would have pulled his own heart out" look!

13:17.792 --> 13:20.208
Okay, we have been spending
way too much time together.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.417
(cell phone rings)

13:24.500 --> 13:26.417
Heh heh.
Guess what there, wifey.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.208
You can't be a pain in the ass
if I don't have a phone.

13:29.291 --> 13:33.208
Ah--ohh! Hi, sweetie.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.792
Save it. I was just
calling to tell you

13:34.875 --> 13:37.417
that I'm taking Jack and staying
at my mother's for a few months.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.000
But who's going to be
looking after him

13:39.083 --> 13:41.125
when you and your mother
go out marauding for flesh?

13:41.208 --> 13:43.667
Thank you for making this
so much easier, Perry.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.750
Jordan! Jordan--
come on, Jordan!

13:46.834 --> 13:48.208
Aah...

13:48.291 --> 13:49.333
Are you okay?

13:49.417 --> 13:53.166
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go
check on Miss Myers.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.250
Molly sent her down to surgery.

13:55.917 --> 13:58.000
Oh ho, wrong day,
new chick!

13:58.083 --> 13:59.583
(J.D.) <i>In a hospital,</i>
<i>it's hard not to let</i>

13:59.667 --> 14:02.583
<i>your personal life affect</i>
<i>your professional life.</i>

14:02.667 --> 14:06.667
(Turk) <i>Forget about J.D. You're just</i>
<i>as good as the Todd. You got this.</i>

14:06.750 --> 14:10.875
All right, people,
I believe we're done here.

14:10.959 --> 14:13.625
Did you just sew your gown
into the patient?

14:13.709 --> 14:15.041
Yeah, you did.

14:17.417 --> 14:20.166
Hey! Hey, somebody! Hey!

14:20.250 --> 14:21.458
Randall was in
the air conditioning vent

14:21.542 --> 14:23.792
and it collapsed on him. Buddy!

14:23.875 --> 14:25.417
(coughing)

14:25.500 --> 14:28.291
Co-chief! Co-chief!

14:28.375 --> 14:31.959
Hey, you fixed him!
Come on, buddy.

14:32.041 --> 14:33.709
(J.D.) <i>That's it!</i>

14:33.792 --> 14:36.333
Dr. Kelso, could you help me out?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.417
People have been referring to me
as the co-chief resident.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.667
Well, it sounds like something you should
take up with the chief resident.

14:42.750 --> 14:43.875
But I'm the chief resident!

14:43.959 --> 14:47.166
Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out
to the chief resident,

14:47.250 --> 14:49.417
and mine's made out
to the co-chief resident,

14:49.500 --> 14:50.917
but we both make the same amount.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.834
You're right. Dr. Reid, you should be
making $10 more a month,

14:53.917 --> 14:56.959
and, of course, Dr. Dorian,
you should be making $10 less.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.500
I know it's not much,
but it's largely

14:58.583 --> 15:00.208
to symbolize the difference
in your levels.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.750
-Coolio!
-Coolio indeed.

15:02.834 --> 15:03.750
Ha ha ha!

15:03.834 --> 15:05.667
(J.D.) <i>I could spend all day worrying</i>
<i>about what just happened,</i>

15:05.750 --> 15:08.500
<i>but I have more important</i>
<i>things to do.</i>

15:08.583 --> 15:11.583
Hey, man, look what
I confiscated

15:11.667 --> 15:13.083
from one of the kids in pediatrics.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.458
-(bang)
-Ow!

15:14.542 --> 15:15.959
-What, too hot?
-Yeah!

15:16.041 --> 15:18.333
-Sorry.
-Not in the mood!

15:18.417 --> 15:20.417
Okay, look, we both might
have had bad days,

15:20.500 --> 15:23.125
but I got just the thing
that's gonna cheer us up.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.709
Ahh, dream come true, right?

15:27.792 --> 15:30.250
Do you really think I want this suit?

15:31.041 --> 15:33.959
Well, I do...
But not from you!

15:34.041 --> 15:35.125
(creaking)

15:35.208 --> 15:37.375
Oh, now I get it.
You're just mad

15:37.458 --> 15:38.875
because I make
more money than you.

15:38.959 --> 15:42.667
No, I'm mad because of
that surgery today.

15:42.750 --> 15:43.917
You doubted me.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.542
You are such a wuss!

15:47.625 --> 15:50.333
Turk, come on!

15:50.417 --> 15:51.834
(door slams)

15:51.917 --> 15:55.125
Oh. These things chafe.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.667
Now I know why
Eddie called it <i>Raw.</i>

15:58.750 --> 16:01.834
Carla, do you have any powder?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.625
Yo! You went behind my back.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.709
I gave you every opportunity
to do the right thing.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.333
I'll tell you what there,
miss manners,

16:11.417 --> 16:13.208
why don't you go ahead
and gulp down

16:13.291 --> 16:15.667
that bear-sized bite
and then we'll talk.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.083
Mmm.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.917
Mmm. Mmm.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Mmm! Mmm.

16:26.083 --> 16:29.083
(humming)

16:31.125 --> 16:33.458
Mmm! Yummy!

16:33.542 --> 16:34.834
Man, that is great kielbasa,

16:34.917 --> 16:37.542
but you can't really screw up
kielbasa, can you?

16:37.625 --> 16:38.792
So, um, where were we?

16:38.875 --> 16:41.208
Honest to God,
I can't remember.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.500
Oh, right, Miss Myers.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.458
The plastic surgeon said
it was safe to operate,

16:45.542 --> 16:47.375
and Miss Myers really
liked her old face,

16:47.458 --> 16:49.250
and you don't have to be
a psychiatrist to see, Perry,

16:49.333 --> 16:52.000
that if you used to be truly happy
and now you're not,

16:52.083 --> 16:54.125
then you should go back
to the way it was when you were happy.

16:55.250 --> 16:58.583
-Isn't that what you would do?
-Yeah.

17:00.333 --> 17:04.333
(panting) Jordan...

17:04.417 --> 17:07.792
Will you... Will you divorce me?

17:07.875 --> 17:10.750
-Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
-Thank God.

17:10.834 --> 17:14.834
(grunting)

17:14.917 --> 17:17.709
Aah! Ooh! Ahh.

17:17.792 --> 17:21.458
Listen, I probably should have put a stop
to all this co-chief stuff.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.917
What co-chief stuff? I haven't even
been thinking about it.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.208
Look, J.D.,
ever since you dumped me,

17:26.291 --> 17:29.000
everyone around here has been treating me
like some kind of a victim. It's like:

17:29.083 --> 17:31.458
"Ooh, look at poor Elliot
going home alone."

17:31.542 --> 17:32.709
Or "Ooh, look at poor Elliot,

17:32.792 --> 17:35.000
riding a tandem bike by herself."

17:35.083 --> 17:37.333
That's not something
I normally do.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.583
I just wanted ice cream the other night,
my car was out of gas,

17:39.667 --> 17:42.125
and that's the bike
the Gundersons loaned me.

17:42.208 --> 17:45.667
(sighs) They do everything together.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.583
Okay.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.458
The point is, it was nice being the one
chief resident for a while, you know?

17:56.792 --> 17:58.959
She's got fingers like biceps.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.917
And so, by the power vested in me

18:05.041 --> 18:07.750
by the American Bar Association,

18:07.834 --> 18:11.625
I pronounce you ex-husband and ex-wife.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.792
You may now do
whatever the hell you want!

18:14.875 --> 18:16.959
<i>♪ I feel like cryin' ♪</i>

18:17.041 --> 18:18.250
I've never been this happy.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.000
Me, neither.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.583
You have no chance
of being normal.

18:22.667 --> 18:23.583
Mm-mm.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.208
(cheering)

18:32.333 --> 18:33.333
Thirsty, huh?

18:33.417 --> 18:36.542
Helps the tears taste less bitter.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.709
Cheers.

18:39.125 --> 18:41.291
So, how are you guys going
to celebrate your divorce?

18:41.375 --> 18:42.417
By not inviting you.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.834
Oh, my God, dude,
I doubted you for a second,

18:44.917 --> 18:45.917
why are you so mad?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.125
Maybe I needed you
to believe in me.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.375
I believe in you, baby.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.208
Yeah, but we're married,
that doesn't count.

18:52.834 --> 18:55.417
(Carla)
What the...? Ow!

18:55.500 --> 18:56.500
Did you...?

18:56.583 --> 18:58.041
Yeah. She's been graveled.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.291
Nice work.

19:00.542 --> 19:03.750
Look, man, it was
one second of doubt, okay?

19:04.333 --> 19:05.959
Since when do you care
what anybody else thinks?

19:06.041 --> 19:09.125
I don't. I care what you think.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.792
Since the day I met you,
you've treated me like I was the man.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.750
Like I could accomplish everything.

19:15.792 --> 19:17.000
This is gonna sound lame...

19:17.083 --> 19:18.291
I got it!

19:22.166 --> 19:23.959
You being like that
is one of the reasons

19:24.041 --> 19:25.667
I've gotten to where I am.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.250
Wow. That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.333
Aah! Unh!

19:33.709 --> 19:36.333
(J.D.) <i>In the end, every relationship</i>
<i>needs maintenance.</i>

19:36.417 --> 19:39.041
Hey, Ted, get out the sun, man.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.625
You owe me money!

19:45.375 --> 19:46.834
(J.D.) <i>Whether</i>
<i>it's the smallest gesture...</i>

19:46.917 --> 19:48.417
Hey, doctor! Doc!

19:48.500 --> 19:51.166
You want to take a look at the guy
in 302 and tell me

19:51.250 --> 19:53.250
whether or not you think
he's really sick or just bonkers.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.709
Are you actually
asking my opinion?

19:54.792 --> 19:58.208
Well, I'm gonna ignore it,
but, yeah, knock yourself out.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.917
(J.D.) <i>Or just picking up</i>
<i>back where you left off.</i>

20:03.000 --> 20:04.917
I'm a little nervous
about surgery tomorrow.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.834
Aw, you'll kick ass, man.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.250
(Door opens)

20:09.041 --> 20:10.709
So are you guys gonna go out tonight?

20:10.792 --> 20:12.792
No, we're gonna stay in.

20:13.583 --> 20:16.083
(creaking)

20:16.166 --> 20:17.500
(sighs)

20:17.583 --> 20:20.625
Well, I'll be in the bedroom
with all the straight people.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.542
Are your giblets warm?

20:22.625 --> 20:24.667
-Like a Christmas ham.
-Same.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.166
(J.D.) <i>The bottom line is that</i>
<i>if you care about someone,</i>

20:29.250 --> 20:31.333
<i>it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.</i>

20:31.417 --> 20:33.500
Wow. Thanks, J.D.

20:37.291 --> 20:40.917
And she's just been graveled.
