00:22.430 --> 00:25.428
Mr. Beaton, you've been
described at various times

00:25.430 --> 00:28.295
as an author,
a designer, a dandy...

00:28.297 --> 00:30.794
you may not report yourself
a dandy, but other people have...

00:30.796 --> 00:32.162
a painter, a photographer.

00:32.164 --> 00:34.895
Now, which of these
is your main profession?

00:34.897 --> 00:36.527
I wish I knew.

00:36.529 --> 00:37.694
I'm afraid that's been
my trouble

00:37.696 --> 00:39.661
for a very long time.

00:41.296 --> 00:42.461
The visual, really,

00:42.463 --> 00:44.894
guides my life
more than anything.

00:58.662 --> 01:02.328
"There is scarcely
a flattering self-portrait."

01:04.629 --> 01:08.727
"Yet truth begins
with one's self."

01:16.729 --> 01:19.760
"Of all the forms
of writing,

01:19.762 --> 01:22.228
diaries are
the most personal."

01:27.829 --> 01:31.694
"My obsession stems from
those same obscure motives

01:31.696 --> 01:33.827
that have impelled me
to take snapshots

01:33.829 --> 01:35.162
all my life."

01:40.696 --> 01:44.761
"I exposed thousands
of rolls of films,

01:44.763 --> 01:48.327
wrote hundreds
of thousands of words,

01:48.329 --> 01:52.593
in a futile attempt to preserve
the fleeting moment."

01:54.329 --> 01:57.761
"Some people seem to know
their vocation instinctively

01:57.763 --> 02:01.628
and follow a single path
their whole lives.

02:01.630 --> 02:04.560
Others wander
in the labyrinth of choice."

02:08.229 --> 02:12.461
"I started out
with very little talent,

02:12.463 --> 02:15.828
but I was so tormented
with ambition."

02:18.297 --> 02:20.894
"Once you've started
for the end of the rainbow,

02:20.896 --> 02:23.528
you can't very well turn back."

02:28.429 --> 02:31.194
It's interesting
looking through his career

02:31.196 --> 02:36.426
to break it up
into categories, genres.

02:36.428 --> 02:38.793
The fashion work,
the portraiture,

02:38.795 --> 02:40.660
the film and theater work.

02:42.463 --> 02:46.560
But, in fact,
they meld into one.

02:46.562 --> 02:49.794
It's always Beaton's look,
Beaton's touch.

02:53.829 --> 02:59.827
He just gave over his life
to expressing beauty,

02:59.829 --> 03:01.593
however he could do it.

03:04.297 --> 03:07.693
In fact, he was... if he hadn't
have done photography,

03:07.695 --> 03:08.894
if he had just done <i>
My Fair Lady,</i>

03:08.896 --> 03:10.628
that would have
been enough for me.

03:20.562 --> 03:22.761
He's looking very nostalgically
to the period

03:22.763 --> 03:25.327
immediately before
the First World War,

03:25.329 --> 03:27.761
the High Belle Époque,
Edwardian England,

03:27.763 --> 03:31.593
and it's this wild escapism

03:31.595 --> 03:33.195
that is kind of
hand in hand

03:33.197 --> 03:37.627
with an extraordinary
futurism and modernism.

03:37.629 --> 03:41.461
In fact, Cecil, you could even
say invented the Edwardian

03:41.463 --> 03:42.860
and gave it a different look,

03:42.862 --> 03:44.393
'cause he invented it
with <i> My Fair Lady</i>

03:44.395 --> 03:46.295
'cause nobody
ever looked like that.

03:46.297 --> 03:50.360
I mean, this... it's like,
uh, I mean, ever.

03:55.428 --> 03:56.560
Come on.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.461
Come on, Dover.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.464
Come on.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.761
Come on, Dover!

04:02.763 --> 04:04.830
Move your bloomin' arse!

04:06.396 --> 04:09.161
Beaton had this wonderful eye

04:09.163 --> 04:12.162
that could assimilate
and draw magic

04:12.164 --> 04:15.427
from the best of everything
that happened around him

04:15.429 --> 04:17.360
and from the past.

04:17.362 --> 04:21.560
But it's the approach of
somebody with this relentless,

04:21.563 --> 04:25.260
restless visual hunger
and appetite for beauty.

04:27.863 --> 04:29.693
What is beauty to you?

04:29.695 --> 04:31.861
I think that
Francis Bacon said it

04:31.863 --> 04:37.162
when he considered there should
be something curious in it.

04:38.830 --> 04:43.326
I think that beauty
is only static for so long

04:43.328 --> 04:45.694
and then we move on
with our own eyes.

04:45.696 --> 04:50.895
I mean, if you see too much
of something too long,

04:50.897 --> 04:54.627
then change
your attitude to beauty

04:54.629 --> 04:59.860
and new wonderful vicissitudes
of beauty appear.

05:01.795 --> 05:05.693
He had a relationship
with the idea of the person,

05:05.695 --> 05:07.727
not actually the person.

05:09.929 --> 05:12.294
There's truth in fantasy,

05:12.296 --> 05:17.861
and I think Beaton was one of
the pioneers in that concept.

05:17.863 --> 05:20.461
When you started, it wasn't
at all the fashionable,

05:20.463 --> 05:23.528
trendy thing it is today
to be a photographer.

05:23.530 --> 05:24.628
Oh, heavens, no.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.427
No, a photographer had

05:26.429 --> 05:28.927
a very ambiguous position
in society.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.494
He was very much
looked down upon.

05:31.496 --> 05:33.194
Not that I really settled

05:33.196 --> 05:34.827
for being a photographer
when I started.

05:34.829 --> 05:38.294
I think that that was
really a means to an end.

05:43.229 --> 05:45.727
As a boy,
I was stage-struck

05:45.729 --> 05:50.326
and I used to haunt
the outside of theaters

05:50.328 --> 05:53.561
looking at the photographs
of the leading actresses.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.293
And one morning I saw
this photograph postcard

05:59.295 --> 06:01.461
of Lily Elsie,

06:01.463 --> 06:04.293
and I thought I'd never
seen anything so beautiful.

06:07.862 --> 06:11.761
He took such inspiration
from the theater,

06:11.763 --> 06:14.828
from a world
into which you step,

06:14.830 --> 06:16.627
you suspend disbelief,

06:16.629 --> 06:20.426
you give yourself up to whatever
is happening on that stage,

06:20.428 --> 06:25.594
and... and you leave in
this sort of cloud of delight.

06:25.596 --> 06:29.327
That was the way he determined
to live his life.

06:32.495 --> 06:36.426
I used to take photographs
of my sisters

06:36.428 --> 06:38.761
and I used to dress
my sisters up.

06:38.763 --> 06:41.828
They were very gauche,
rather ugly little school girls.

06:47.862 --> 06:49.693
I was entirely self-taught

06:49.695 --> 06:51.827
and I've always been
extremely bad

06:51.829 --> 06:55.294
about anything mechanical
or technical.

06:55.296 --> 06:58.594
But still I did learn
exactly how I wanted

06:58.596 --> 07:02.494
to get the effects
that I was aiming at.

07:02.496 --> 07:04.694
When the time came for you
to go to school,

07:04.696 --> 07:09.160
was this a relief
or did you find it a burden?

07:09.162 --> 07:12.361
Oh, I found it appalling.

07:12.363 --> 07:14.461
At school I really was a dud.

07:14.463 --> 07:16.597
I was a very bad scholar.

07:18.396 --> 07:23.493
I'm pretty near uneducated.

07:23.495 --> 07:28.827
I didn't read a book
until I was 18, really.

07:28.829 --> 07:30.728
I learned a lot in school,

07:30.730 --> 07:32.794
but nothing to do
with the things

07:32.796 --> 07:34.393
that I should
have learned.

07:39.296 --> 07:44.226
"In 1922,
I arrived at Cambridge.

07:44.228 --> 07:47.493
I set about becoming
a rabid aesthete.

07:47.495 --> 07:51.393
I took a passionate interest
in the Italian Renaissance,

07:51.395 --> 07:53.727
in Diaghilev's Russian Ballet,

07:53.729 --> 07:57.694
and, of course, in the theater
and in photography."

08:01.363 --> 08:03.193
The new doors
were opening to me.

08:03.195 --> 08:05.561
This was something that
I had never known before,

08:05.563 --> 08:10.160
and I was thrilled by the fact
that certain people

08:10.162 --> 08:13.426
would give up their life
to aestheticism.

08:13.428 --> 08:15.527
I thought it was lots of fun.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.260
Did you go in for the rather
more bizarre extremities

08:18.262 --> 08:21.261
of this style of dressing
in fancy clothes and so on?

08:21.263 --> 08:24.693
I think I dressed in
a rather peculiar garb, yes.

08:26.662 --> 08:29.828
I wanted to show
my individuality.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.927
In fact, I'm not so sure

08:31.929 --> 08:34.895
that I didn't rather
like shocking people.

08:39.729 --> 08:41.293
Couldn't help it.

08:41.294 --> 08:45.326
I think he couldn't help
getting in drag at college.

08:45.328 --> 08:47.194
He couldn't help himself
putting on

08:47.196 --> 08:49.193
his mum's nail varnish
when he was five years old.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.294
He wasn't being provocative
and rebellious.

08:52.296 --> 08:54.827
It was in him and it came out.

08:57.229 --> 09:00.528
"During the three years
I spent at the university,

09:00.530 --> 09:03.160
I never went to any lectures.

09:03.162 --> 09:06.161
Instead, I formed
the theater club,

09:06.163 --> 09:07.694
designed scenery,

09:07.696 --> 09:10.293
and performed
in stage productions."

09:14.596 --> 09:16.861
He also promoted himself hugely.

09:16.863 --> 09:20.460
He would send up a photograph of
himself to newspapers, saying,

09:20.462 --> 09:21.560
"This is Cecil Beaton,

09:21.562 --> 09:22.560
he's currently working
on the sets

09:22.562 --> 09:24.293
of Pirandello's <i> Henry IV,"</i>

09:24.295 --> 09:27.494
and in a sense you could say
he's almost the first PR man

09:27.496 --> 09:29.760
because his line was,

09:29.762 --> 09:31.727
"The more people
who know about the play,

09:31.729 --> 09:32.861
the more money we can spend,"

09:32.863 --> 09:36.160
and the money would be spent
in the absolute priority

09:36.162 --> 09:39.694
of sets and costumes
by Cecil Beaton,

09:39.696 --> 09:41.527
written by the playwright
and starring the actors

09:41.529 --> 09:42.561
in that order.

09:44.295 --> 09:45.761
Running through
Beaton's career

09:45.763 --> 09:49.293
principally devoted
to photographing others

09:49.295 --> 09:51.560
is an obsession with
photographing himself,

09:51.562 --> 09:53.161
staging himself.

09:53.163 --> 09:56.693
Just one of this world
of style and elegance

09:56.695 --> 09:59.794
and fantasy
that he was creating.

09:59.796 --> 10:03.194
His life was a stage.

10:03.196 --> 10:06.727
"In 1925, I came to the end
of my Cambridge years

10:06.729 --> 10:10.294
without a degree,
having failed, as usual,

10:10.296 --> 10:13.661
in all my examinations."

10:13.663 --> 10:16.494
Did you feel totally
confident and successful

10:16.496 --> 10:17.793
in anything
that you had done

10:17.795 --> 10:19.660
or were you still insecure?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.760
Most insecure.

10:21.762 --> 10:24.694
What were your ambitions
at that time?

10:24.696 --> 10:28.761
To be able
to demonstrate

10:28.763 --> 10:33.694
that I was not just
an ordinary anonymous person.

10:33.696 --> 10:38.660
"The truth is, I didn't know
what I wanted to do or be.

10:38.662 --> 10:41.226
I should have liked
to have been an actor,

10:41.228 --> 10:45.628
but somehow I was diffident
or even terrified about this.

10:45.630 --> 10:47.527
I wanted to write plays,

10:47.529 --> 10:50.693
but I could find
nothing to write about.

10:50.695 --> 10:53.593
I longed to design
for the theater,

10:53.595 --> 10:56.561
but how is one
ever to get an offer?

10:56.563 --> 10:59.394
The only thing I could do
without being invited

10:59.396 --> 11:01.893
was to indulge
my photographic hobby."

11:13.228 --> 11:17.694
"My sisters continued to show
compassion to me in my mania."

11:17.696 --> 11:20.561
But it was absolute torture

11:20.563 --> 11:22.160
'cause the more
I tried to keep still

11:22.162 --> 11:23.693
the more I twitched.

11:23.695 --> 11:25.326
It was so uncomfortable,
I remember,

11:25.328 --> 11:27.294
'cause you would say,
"Put your head on one side,

11:27.296 --> 11:29.926
stick your chin in, your
stomach out, cross your leg,"

11:29.928 --> 11:32.294
I mean, I was like
a ruddy corkscrew in the end.

11:34.730 --> 11:35.728
He couldn't do much
with the father,

11:35.730 --> 11:37.461
but he could do
quite a lot with the mother

11:37.463 --> 11:39.628
and the two sisters
and he did.

11:39.630 --> 11:42.160
He would put notices in
if his mother gave a party,

11:42.162 --> 11:43.561
and that would get
printed in the paper

11:43.563 --> 11:45.426
and she would be kind of like...

11:45.428 --> 11:46.461
she'd know he'd done it

11:46.463 --> 11:48.260
but get sort of half-irritated

11:48.262 --> 11:50.294
but half probably
quite excited.

11:50.296 --> 11:52.660
And he used to dress
the two sisters up identically,

11:52.662 --> 11:54.293
and because
there were two of them

11:54.295 --> 11:56.160
and they looked quite similar
in many ways,

11:56.162 --> 11:59.426
they very often appeared
in the society columns.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.461
Cecil was very vain
in a certain way

12:02.463 --> 12:04.594
and very, very insecure.

12:04.596 --> 12:08.594
I think the insecurity
stems from those early years

12:08.596 --> 12:12.461
of never really feeling that
his family was grand enough

12:12.463 --> 12:16.628
or, you know, it's not the kind
of family he wanted to be from.

12:17.462 --> 12:19.560
Going right back
to your childhood,

12:19.562 --> 12:23.594
you come of a prosperous
upper middle class family,

12:23.596 --> 12:26.628
so it seems to me
from reading your diaries.

12:26.630 --> 12:29.894
You've written very fully
about your father.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.760
Now what was it that
made it difficult for you

12:31.762 --> 12:34.493
to get on with your father?

12:34.495 --> 12:36.161
Well, I think
it was very difficult

12:36.163 --> 12:38.161
for my father
to get on with me.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.859
"My father insisted
on living in Hampstead,

12:45.861 --> 12:48.660
a suburb of London,

12:48.662 --> 12:52.894
as he considered the air
healthier for children.

12:52.896 --> 12:55.561
I was born in 1904.

12:55.563 --> 12:57.694
There were two boys,
my brother, Reggie,

12:57.696 --> 13:00.594
being a year younger than me.

13:00.596 --> 13:02.661
Five and seven years later,

13:02.663 --> 13:05.859
my two sisters,
Nancy and Baba, were born."

13:07.730 --> 13:11.594
Until I reached the age
of puberty, shall we say,

13:11.596 --> 13:14.792
I had an idyllically
happy childhood.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.326
I wasn't conscious until later

13:19.328 --> 13:23.528
that perhaps there wasn't
as much money as I would like.

13:23.530 --> 13:26.294
My father
was a timber merchant,

13:26.296 --> 13:28.528
and he wanted, obviously,

13:28.530 --> 13:31.627
to have somebody who was
going to be like him.

13:31.629 --> 13:33.628
And I found that
very difficult.

13:33.630 --> 13:37.793
Intuitively, I went against
many of the things

13:37.795 --> 13:40.627
that he stood for and liked.

13:42.562 --> 13:45.527
"Reggie was my father's
favorite son."

13:48.695 --> 13:51.426
"The two understood one another.

13:51.428 --> 13:53.528
They were kindred spirits."

13:59.328 --> 14:02.461
"My mother's dressing table
drawer of powder, rouge,

14:02.463 --> 14:06.294
and mascara held
an uncanny fascination for me."

14:09.196 --> 14:13.693
"One day, I stole into her
bedroom and painted my face."

14:15.829 --> 14:18.527
"My father caught sight of me.

14:18.529 --> 14:22.293
He became so enraged that
I was locked in my bedroom."

14:26.262 --> 14:27.427
Now, did your mother know

14:27.429 --> 14:28.827
about this feeling
of yours at the time?

14:28.829 --> 14:31.427
Did she sympathize with you?

14:31.429 --> 14:35.193
In a vague way,
but she was too busy

14:35.195 --> 14:38.426
getting on with the job
of looking after a family.

14:38.428 --> 14:39.827
She wasn't able to help you

14:39.829 --> 14:41.859
in this particular
difficulty anyway.

14:41.861 --> 14:43.860
No, no one could help me.

14:43.862 --> 14:48.294
It was up to me to find
the sort of world that I wanted.

14:48.296 --> 14:51.528
I think Cecil certainly wanted
to scale the social tree.

14:51.530 --> 14:54.894
And he was the first
photographer, really,

14:54.896 --> 14:57.560
to establish himself
in the world

14:57.562 --> 14:59.659
of what would be called
Fashionable Society

14:59.661 --> 15:01.826
with a capital S,
it doesn't exist anymore,

15:01.828 --> 15:03.827
but he wanted to be up there.

15:03.829 --> 15:06.293
The camera was,
in a way, I suppose,

15:06.295 --> 15:08.427
his passport
into that world,

15:08.429 --> 15:10.692
but what you need,
eventually,

15:10.694 --> 15:14.160
is a patron, and he found that
in Stephen Tennant.

15:15.694 --> 15:17.560
"Stephen Tennant.

15:17.562 --> 15:21.727
I first met this remarkably
poetic looking apparition

15:21.729 --> 15:23.826
while he rode
the papier-mâché horses

15:23.828 --> 15:27.626
on the roundabouts
at the Olympia Circus.

15:27.628 --> 15:29.593
He wore a black leather coat

15:29.595 --> 15:33.561
with a large Elizabethan
collar of chinchilla.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.527
As he blew kisses
to left and right,

15:36.529 --> 15:39.561
he created
an unforgettable sight."

15:41.428 --> 15:43.692
Stephen Tennant was rich,
good looking,

15:43.694 --> 15:46.194
bursts of imagination,
very successful,

15:46.196 --> 15:48.659
he knew everybody,
he was surrounded by a bevy

15:48.661 --> 15:50.560
of Guinness girls
and Bright Young Things,

15:50.562 --> 15:53.394
and that's exactly the world
that Cecil Beaton wanted.

15:55.529 --> 15:58.528
"I became a member
of the Bright Young Things

15:58.530 --> 16:01.394
who did silly things.

16:01.396 --> 16:04.693
Organized treasure hunts,
spoof exhibitions,

16:04.695 --> 16:06.494
and dressed up
for nights on end

16:06.496 --> 16:08.427
in fancy dress costumes."

16:10.594 --> 16:14.660
"Our activities were all done
with zest and originality.

16:14.662 --> 16:16.759
What a rush life had become."

16:32.262 --> 16:33.094
Cecil Beaton,
I should think,

16:33.096 --> 16:35.626
probably photographed
all of them.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.859
Whenever he photographed one,
another one would appear.

16:37.861 --> 16:41.360
I mean, they came in relays,
really, to Sussex Gardens

16:41.362 --> 16:43.361
to be photographed by Cecil.

16:46.861 --> 16:49.659
All those portraits
of Stephen Tennant.

16:49.661 --> 16:52.827
You know, ropes of pearls
and looking in a mirror.

16:52.829 --> 16:55.826
I mean, they are
terribly narcissistic.

16:55.828 --> 16:59.726
The kind of noir quality
to some of those things

16:59.728 --> 17:03.394
that goes back to the decadence
of the 1890s

17:03.396 --> 17:06.693
and Oscar Wilde
and all that sort of thing.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.827
He wanted to be one of them.

17:10.694 --> 17:12.727
Forgetting the formality
and the hierarchy

17:12.729 --> 17:14.426
and the snobbism of the era,

17:14.429 --> 17:18.660
I think just
the basic Bright Young Things

17:18.662 --> 17:22.692
and being with them
would have been amazing.

17:22.694 --> 17:27.559
Just that youth
and that damn elegance.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.427
Part of Beaton's world
of the imagination

17:31.429 --> 17:34.226
obviously was
the dressing up trunk.

17:34.228 --> 17:37.327
The idea of opening this...
this trunk

17:37.329 --> 17:38.893
and pulling out costumes

17:38.895 --> 17:42.326
and becoming
different personalities.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.926
They were traveling
back in time

17:44.928 --> 17:48.161
and having a glorious time
doing it.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.693
Well, I would love to have been
on the bridge with Rex Whistler

17:54.695 --> 17:58.927
and the Jungman sisters,
and, I have to say,

17:58.929 --> 18:02.194
I'd like to insert myself
into that picture.

18:04.562 --> 18:06.426
Beaton was essentially
an outsider

18:06.428 --> 18:07.660
striving to get in.

18:08.761 --> 18:12.459
Stephen Tennant, of course,
was to the manor born,

18:12.461 --> 18:16.792
and Beaton didn't have
an inherited income

18:16.794 --> 18:21.760
and, you know, he had to work
bloody hard for the money

18:21.762 --> 18:23.261
and to keep it all going.

18:27.694 --> 18:30.659
"I often wonder how it was
that none of the beautiful,

18:30.661 --> 18:34.660
eminent, or celebrated
personages I photographed

18:34.662 --> 18:38.493
raised an objection
to being seen upside down

18:38.495 --> 18:41.261
embowered in flowers,

18:41.263 --> 18:43.726
cellophane clouds,

18:43.728 --> 18:45.394
or almost asphyxiating

18:45.396 --> 18:48.426
with their heads under
a Victorian glass dome."

18:49.395 --> 18:52.360
"But, no, it seemed
I could indulge myself

18:52.362 --> 18:54.425
to my heart's content."

19:00.861 --> 19:04.360
The idea of taking silver foil
and putting it up.

19:04.362 --> 19:07.692
I mean, seeing beauty in
something people wrap food in.

19:09.929 --> 19:12.194
It's sort of turning things
on their head

19:12.196 --> 19:14.161
of what they're
not meant to be.

19:15.561 --> 19:17.426
The sitter really became

19:17.428 --> 19:19.392
much less important
than the background

19:19.394 --> 19:22.161
or the whole conception
of the design

19:22.163 --> 19:24.327
that I had made
with the camera.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.526
And yet one very seldom
sees unknown faces

19:26.528 --> 19:27.761
photographed by Beaton.

19:27.763 --> 19:30.560
Was that a conscious policy
to find distinguished sitters?

19:30.562 --> 19:33.193
No, I wouldn't say it was
conscious in that way.

19:33.195 --> 19:35.260
I mean, I've photographed
a lot of friends

19:35.262 --> 19:36.692
who weren't at all well-known.

19:36.694 --> 19:38.592
I think, obviously,
that impression comes

19:38.594 --> 19:40.894
because it was the distinguished
or well-known ones

19:40.896 --> 19:43.359
that got into the newspapers.

19:43.361 --> 19:47.326
And I did have an eye
to publicity.

19:47.328 --> 19:49.792
That was very astonishing
for my father

19:49.794 --> 19:53.692
who was quite baffled at the way
things suddenly moved.

19:53.694 --> 19:57.827
Because very soon
I went to America.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.726
I was confident
that I would really

20:00.728 --> 20:03.692
just take America by storm.

20:05.862 --> 20:09.827
What a marvelous thing
great physical beauty is.

20:09.829 --> 20:12.893
It's nothing less
than a living miracle.

20:12.895 --> 20:17.359
It's not the result
of achievement, skill,

20:17.361 --> 20:19.559
patience,
or endeavor.

20:19.561 --> 20:22.527
It's just a divine happening.

20:22.529 --> 20:25.526
"Soon after my arrival
in New York,

20:25.528 --> 20:28.326
I publicly challenged
the standards of beauty

20:28.328 --> 20:30.792
between English
and American women."

20:32.494 --> 20:34.759
For beautiful necks and heads,

20:34.761 --> 20:38.792
England possesses
the prize winners.

20:38.794 --> 20:42.593
There are many whose beauty
should be immortal,

20:42.595 --> 20:45.693
for their alabaster complexions,

20:45.695 --> 20:48.726
their cheeks
like pink ice creams,

20:48.728 --> 20:50.460
the cherry lips,

20:50.462 --> 20:53.260
pansy eyes,
the feathery lashes.

21:03.394 --> 21:06.326
I think to begin with
in my career,

21:06.328 --> 21:10.259
I was terribly limited
in my approach,

21:10.261 --> 21:14.194
and I only could appreciate
certain forms

21:14.196 --> 21:16.760
of character or beauty.

21:19.163 --> 21:23.259
But the English fail badly
about feet and legs.

21:23.261 --> 21:25.693
And here the New Yorkers win,

21:25.695 --> 21:28.226
for their wrists,
their ankles,

21:28.228 --> 21:30.793
their legs,
their movements,

21:30.795 --> 21:34.592
they are perfect
and essential in 1929.

21:42.495 --> 21:45.693
"I fell in love with the new
energy I found in the streets

21:45.695 --> 21:48.460
and quickly began
recording it with my camera."

21:53.829 --> 21:59.527
I think, with experience,
looking around in life,

21:59.529 --> 22:05.827
the photographer
gets to appreciate beauty

22:05.829 --> 22:09.426
in very much wider fields.

22:14.695 --> 22:17.692
There's that old expression,
"Beauty is where you see it."

22:17.694 --> 22:20.692
I think beauty is there
to be recognized

22:20.694 --> 22:23.460
and I think
it's terribly important

22:23.462 --> 22:28.660
for the photographer
to approach the subject

22:28.662 --> 22:31.893
with a very definite
point of view of his own.

22:36.662 --> 22:39.293
Well, it took some time
and it was touch and go

22:39.295 --> 22:41.827
when then suddenly
things went well.

22:41.829 --> 22:44.292
I got a terribly good contract.

22:55.294 --> 22:57.626
Beaton wasn't the first
fashion photographer.

22:57.628 --> 22:59.426
He didn't invent the genre,

22:59.428 --> 23:01.627
but he certainly took it places.

23:03.195 --> 23:06.392
He brought romance,
he brought a sense of style,

23:06.394 --> 23:08.826
he knew how to pose his models,

23:08.828 --> 23:11.560
he knew how to create the mood,

23:11.562 --> 23:16.325
that ineffable magic
he brought to the mix.

23:16.327 --> 23:20.659
He's the best-known
homegrown British photographer

23:20.661 --> 23:22.859
of that period

23:22.861 --> 23:25.259
crossing the Atlantic and
photographs being published

23:25.261 --> 23:27.426
in both American <i> Vogue</i>
and British <i> Vogue</i>

23:27.428 --> 23:29.860
and also French <i> Vogue.</i>

23:35.427 --> 23:36.459
He's so full of energy,

23:36.461 --> 23:41.292
he finds inspiration everywhere.

23:41.294 --> 23:45.426
You look at the Surrealist
photographs from the 1930s,

23:45.428 --> 23:48.459
it's very much about shadow
and forebodingness

23:48.461 --> 23:50.827
or there's something impending.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.259
And I think a lot of that
is actually taken

23:53.261 --> 23:55.727
from some German
Expressionist cinema.

23:59.728 --> 24:03.893
And, of course,
he makes friends with painters,

24:03.895 --> 24:06.793
Tchelitchew, for example,
and Christian Bérard,

24:06.795 --> 24:09.359
the sort
of French Neo-romantics,

24:09.361 --> 24:12.727
he borrows an awful lot
from them as well.

24:14.929 --> 24:18.359
I think that what he brought
to the world of <i> Vogue</i>

24:18.361 --> 24:22.527
was something that no other
contributor brought,

24:22.529 --> 24:27.159
which was not only was he
a great fashion photographer

24:27.161 --> 24:30.160
and a witty illustrator...

24:31.529 --> 24:36.225
...but he was also
a very, very evocative writer.

24:39.628 --> 24:41.826
"Each winter,
I returned to New York

24:41.828 --> 24:46.592
to take photographs
with a passionate enthusiasm.

24:46.594 --> 24:50.359
But I did not feel I had yet
expressed myself completely."

24:52.828 --> 24:56.493
"I still had a gnawing haunting
for the stage."

25:07.928 --> 25:10.826
I was making a little money
with my photographs,

25:10.828 --> 25:15.359
but I didn't deserve
to have even a cottage.

25:15.361 --> 25:17.827
And I was staying
with Edith Olivier,

25:17.829 --> 25:20.160
who was a great friend of mine.

25:20.162 --> 25:22.593
I said to her, "I wonder if
you know of any little place

25:22.595 --> 25:23.659
that just
would be big enough

25:23.661 --> 25:27.559
to put a pot of honeysuckle
on the windowsill."

25:27.561 --> 25:29.826
And she said, "Well,
there's a deserted place

25:29.828 --> 25:31.759
that had a grotto
in the garden."

25:31.761 --> 25:35.560
Grotto, my heavens,
that's just what we wanted.

25:35.562 --> 25:38.460
I mean, a grotto
sounded so Baroque,

25:38.462 --> 25:43.260
so Sitwellian,
so Romantic, so Italian.

25:43.262 --> 25:47.160
So we went over and eventually
we saw this place.

25:47.162 --> 25:49.293
And we walked down
from the top of the downs,

25:49.295 --> 25:50.927
a very deep descent,

25:50.929 --> 25:54.225
and we looked under
this marvelous archway,

25:54.227 --> 25:56.292
which was part
of the building

25:56.294 --> 25:59.860
that had belonged
to the horses and coaches.

26:03.495 --> 26:08.226
"I was almost numbed by my
first encounter with the house.

26:08.228 --> 26:13.326
It was as if I had been touched
on the head by some magic wand.

26:13.328 --> 26:15.425
It was love at first sight."

26:17.494 --> 26:20.325
"From the moment that I stood
under the archway,

26:20.327 --> 26:23.859
I knew that this place
was destined to be mine."

26:26.662 --> 26:30.692
Ashcombe was really
so remote and so romantic

26:30.694 --> 26:35.760
and so mysterious,
it was magical, really.

26:40.694 --> 26:45.160
I was so proud of this
strange wayward place,

26:45.162 --> 26:47.527
that I tried to bring down
from London

26:47.529 --> 26:50.659
as many friends
as I possibly could to see it,

26:50.661 --> 26:53.693
and they all came under
its rather haunted spell.

27:03.427 --> 27:05.393
When you read
about Ashcombe

27:05.395 --> 27:08.560
and when he was
hosting parties there,

27:08.562 --> 27:09.560
I mean, I just don't know

27:09.562 --> 27:13.292
how the guests had even
one minute to breathe.

27:16.862 --> 27:19.793
If you went to Ashcombe
as a guest,

27:19.795 --> 27:22.292
I can imagine that you'd be
crawling out of there

27:22.294 --> 27:26.360
on Sunday night,
unable to even think

27:26.362 --> 27:28.360
because there was
so much going on.

27:33.561 --> 27:37.426
"Ashcombe had become
a much-painted beauty spot.

27:37.428 --> 27:43.326
Many painters, Tchelitchew,
Whistler, Bérard,

27:43.328 --> 27:46.459
and Dalí made drawings
of the place."

27:52.425 --> 27:54.926
"Tchelitchew at first
intimidated me,

27:54.928 --> 27:59.359
but soon cast an almost hypnotic
influence over me."

28:02.494 --> 28:05.293
"Sometimes, in order
to look at the landscape

28:05.295 --> 28:07.526
from a fresh point of view,

28:07.528 --> 28:10.726
I would employ the simple device
I'd learned from him

28:10.728 --> 28:14.692
of gazing upside down
at my panorama.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.560
It is quite astonishing
to discover

28:16.562 --> 28:19.659
how much more clearly
one can see the picture

28:19.661 --> 28:22.226
without preconceived ideas."

28:29.328 --> 28:33.559
"I decided to give
a fête champêtre at Ashcombe.

28:33.561 --> 28:37.225
Drawings were made of costumes
that my friends must wear."

28:43.194 --> 28:46.225
"Before leaving my house
for the first time,

28:46.227 --> 28:49.693
my guests were made to trace
the outlines of their hands

28:49.695 --> 28:52.792
on the walls
of one of my bathrooms.

28:52.794 --> 28:56.292
By degrees, an extraordinary
connection was achieved."

28:58.762 --> 29:03.293
"For me, the years that followed
were the gayest of my life."

29:04.495 --> 29:10.460
"In that time, life took on
a sudden color and warmth."

29:14.461 --> 29:16.791
"Peter Watson.

29:16.793 --> 29:19.160
His acute sensibility,

29:19.162 --> 29:20.858
subtlety of mind,

29:20.860 --> 29:23.493
wry sense of humor,

29:23.495 --> 29:26.726
and mysterious qualities
of charm

29:26.728 --> 29:29.593
made him unlike anyone
I had known."

29:32.228 --> 29:34.459
"I wish I had
some of his gifts."

29:38.529 --> 29:41.360
I read not long ago
about Peter Watson.

29:41.362 --> 29:44.292
Peter Watson
was absolutely shocking.

29:44.294 --> 29:46.791
And for Cecil he was like, "Oh!"

29:46.793 --> 29:48.527
He was like a god, a young god.

29:48.529 --> 29:50.660
He wasn't that young or wasn't
that god or that beautiful,

29:50.662 --> 29:54.759
but for Cecil it seems to me
that he was like that.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.726
"I have never been
in love with women,

29:58.728 --> 30:00.892
and I don't think
I ever shall be

30:00.894 --> 30:04.925
in the way that I have
been in love with men.

30:04.927 --> 30:09.259
I'm really a terrible,
terrible homosexualist

30:09.261 --> 30:11.792
and try so hard not to be."

30:19.295 --> 30:22.892
The Peter Watson love affair
was very, very troubled.

30:22.894 --> 30:24.627
Peter Watson kept him
very close to him,

30:24.629 --> 30:26.527
but on a sort
of like no-touch basis,

30:26.529 --> 30:28.758
so Cecil Beaton
was kind of like feeling

30:28.760 --> 30:31.758
all the frustrations
of the rejected lover.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.459
What does Peter Watson do?

30:32.461 --> 30:34.359
He goes off with Oliver Messel,

30:34.361 --> 30:36.160
under Cecil's own roof.

30:41.428 --> 30:44.826
"Oliver Messel was my friend
and my rival."

30:49.629 --> 30:52.826
"We had shared lovers,
though I am bound to admit,

30:52.828 --> 30:55.492
I did not do well
in the race."

31:05.529 --> 31:10.293
"There are no regrets in my
amorous friendship with Peter.

31:10.295 --> 31:13.858
I am sad that it was never
a mutual love affair."

31:34.294 --> 31:37.691
"My next stop
was the celluloid oasis.

31:37.693 --> 31:44.226
At this time, all the Hollywood
studios were a buzzing hive.

31:44.228 --> 31:47.426
Not only was this the center
of motion pictures,

31:47.428 --> 31:51.193
but the talkies
had just been invented.

31:51.195 --> 31:54.160
It was a time
when Hollywood was alive."

31:55.394 --> 31:57.626
Then when he went to Hollywood
in the '30s,

31:57.628 --> 31:59.260
he captures Hollywood

31:59.262 --> 32:01.826
and American elegance
like no one.

32:01.828 --> 32:06.426
He managed to make it more
American and chic at the time.

32:06.428 --> 32:10.560
Come on, that picture of
Gary Cooper is beautiful.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.925
"To watch the antics of this
lanky lad in Hollywood

32:13.927 --> 32:16.160
was like watching
and enjoying

32:16.162 --> 32:20.626
the obvious discomfort
of a caged eagle."

32:20.628 --> 32:23.592
I don't think anybody has really
captured the 20th century

32:23.594 --> 32:26.226
in many, many decades
like he has.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.559
"My Hollywood photographs
were widely published

32:46.561 --> 32:48.561
and had a great influence
in the film capital."

32:51.728 --> 32:55.293
"Meanwhile, the unexpected
in all its forms

32:55.295 --> 32:57.193
is always lurking."

32:59.694 --> 33:03.293
"It can strike
at any moment."

33:11.760 --> 33:16.826
He was often asked to illustrate
articles in <i> Vogue.</i>

33:16.828 --> 33:18.625
Into this particular article,

33:18.627 --> 33:20.825
he introduced
some very unpleasant

33:20.827 --> 33:22.558
anti-Semitic slogans,

33:22.560 --> 33:24.692
in particular the word "kike."

33:24.694 --> 33:26.658
But very, very small,
and you'd really need

33:26.660 --> 33:31.625
a magnifying glass
to see what he had written.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.825
Condé<i> Nast,</i>
the proprietor of <i> Vogue,</i>

33:33.827 --> 33:38.193
has to order the pulping
of 130,000 copies

33:38.195 --> 33:40.726
of the magazine.

33:40.728 --> 33:44.859
"Condé was very
emotionally upset.

33:44.861 --> 33:47.692
It was so serious
that I had to resign."

33:51.693 --> 33:55.159
It's very hard to understand
what he was thinking,

33:55.161 --> 33:58.826
'cause half his friends
in New York were Jewish,

33:58.828 --> 34:02.426
and American <i> Vogue</i>
was run by Jewish people.

34:02.428 --> 34:05.393
I mean, it was
an extraordinary thing to do.

34:10.261 --> 34:12.791
"Why did I do that?

34:12.793 --> 34:15.525
I was baffled.

34:15.527 --> 34:20.591
I can only tell you
how deeply sorry I am.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.326
It was done unconsciously.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.558
I am not anti-Jewish

34:24.560 --> 34:29.558
and I am violently hostile
to Hitler."

34:29.560 --> 34:31.425
Why did he do it?

34:31.427 --> 34:34.690
The incident was caused by
thoughtlessness, arrogance,

34:34.693 --> 34:37.824
and misunderstanding of
the gravity of the situation.

34:37.827 --> 34:41.292
And generally just
getting above himself.

34:41.293 --> 34:42.527
And down he went.

34:44.927 --> 34:50.192
And he didn't really work for
a year and a half after that.

34:50.194 --> 34:52.360
It was a wake up moment for him.

34:52.362 --> 34:54.458
He worked very hard
to overcome it,

34:54.460 --> 34:58.692
but it was something
that he didn't forget.

34:58.694 --> 35:01.428
He had some amends to make.

35:11.594 --> 35:15.659
"In July 1939,
the telephone rang.

35:15.661 --> 35:18.424
'This is the lady in waiting
speaking.

35:18.426 --> 35:20.759
The Queen wants to know
if you will photograph her

35:20.761 --> 35:22.558
tomorrow afternoon.'"

35:25.362 --> 35:28.691
"At first I thought
it might be a practical joke,

35:28.693 --> 35:31.359
the sort of thing
Oliver Messel might do."

35:33.294 --> 35:34.825
"But it was no joke.

35:34.827 --> 35:39.626
My pleasure and excitement
were overwhelming.

35:39.628 --> 35:41.859
Another lease of life
extended to me

35:41.861 --> 35:44.160
in my photographic career."

35:48.394 --> 35:51.160
"I decided that of all painters,

35:51.162 --> 35:54.692
the most suitable to express
the Queen's personality

35:54.694 --> 35:56.658
would have been Renoir."

35:58.195 --> 36:01.591
"But there was no Renoir
and I was to face my job

36:01.593 --> 36:04.492
that afternoon
with a camera."

36:19.161 --> 36:21.293
"When I entered the gates
of Buckingham Palace

36:21.295 --> 36:22.826
for the first time,

36:22.828 --> 36:26.791
on my way to photograph that
ravishing and wonderful person,

36:26.793 --> 36:29.858
Queen Elizabeth,
I thought,

36:29.860 --> 36:31.826
'How did I get here?'"

36:37.660 --> 36:40.425
That very first sitting
that Beaton had

36:40.427 --> 36:43.324
with Queen Elizabeth
as she was then,

36:43.326 --> 36:46.159
later the Queen Mother,
was in 1939.

36:46.161 --> 36:48.325
And in his diary
he writes about the fact

36:48.327 --> 36:52.293
that he's expecting the sitting
to last 20 minutes or so.

36:52.295 --> 36:54.859
And, in fact,
he spent a full three hours

36:54.861 --> 36:57.725
at Buckingham Palace
in many of the state rooms,

36:57.727 --> 37:01.325
out in the garden taking
those incredibly romantic,

37:01.327 --> 37:04.160
beautiful pictures of the Queen
with a parasol.

37:04.162 --> 37:09.324
So it was an immediate rapport
that he struck up with the Queen

37:09.326 --> 37:12.159
that then led to so many
subsequent sittings

37:12.161 --> 37:13.925
with her family
and her children.

37:31.494 --> 37:34.160
Beaton photographed
nearly 30 members

37:34.162 --> 37:35.559
of the British royal family,

37:35.561 --> 37:38.925
including the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor.

37:38.927 --> 37:41.826
Beaton's images
of the couple together

37:41.828 --> 37:45.525
helped to promote that idea
of a royal love story

37:45.527 --> 37:50.259
and the king who abdicated
for the woman who he adored.

37:53.293 --> 37:57.226
"Wallis Simpson, the lady who
became the Duchess of Windsor,

37:57.228 --> 38:00.160
was one of my
most frequent subjects."

38:01.426 --> 38:03.391
"For those who enjoy gossip,

38:03.393 --> 38:05.592
she was a particular treat."

38:07.494 --> 38:09.758
I think it's an
extraordinary testament

38:09.760 --> 38:14.858
to his strength of character
that he was able to,

38:14.860 --> 38:18.224
on one hand, photograph
the marriage of Wallis Simpson

38:18.226 --> 38:19.859
to the Duke of Windsor,

38:19.861 --> 38:25.858
and also to then take
photographs of Queen Elizabeth

38:25.860 --> 38:28.859
and her husband,
the reigning king.

38:28.861 --> 38:31.659
These are two sides
of the family

38:31.661 --> 38:34.160
that absolutely
despised each other,

38:34.162 --> 38:35.591
and Beaton
successfully manages

38:35.593 --> 38:39.591
to keep in
with both factions.

38:43.594 --> 38:46.258
"The afternoon light
began to fade,

38:46.260 --> 38:49.160
and the Queen, with all
the wistful symbolism

38:49.162 --> 38:51.459
of a Chekhov character, said,

38:51.461 --> 38:53.359
'You watch, Mr. Beaton,

38:53.361 --> 38:57.159
in a little while the sky
will be rose-colored.

38:57.161 --> 39:01.625
I sometimes think Piccadilly
is on fire every evening.'

39:01.627 --> 39:05.594
Her words, alas,
were only too prophetic."

39:33.193 --> 39:35.826
"The Blitz began in 1940.

39:35.828 --> 39:40.825
For months, London
was terribly bombed.

39:40.827 --> 39:46.558
Once more, I was faced with
my old vocational vertigo.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.925
It was clear that in anything
connected with soldiering,

39:49.927 --> 39:53.459
I would be a real sad sack.

39:53.461 --> 39:55.692
But I wanted to be useful."

39:57.527 --> 40:00.392
"I went down to the city
to photograph the damage done

40:00.394 --> 40:02.292
by Sunday night's raid."

40:14.628 --> 40:17.826
The Minister of Information
was desperate

40:17.828 --> 40:21.159
for international understanding
and support,

40:21.161 --> 40:23.425
particularly from America.

40:23.427 --> 40:25.825
Cecil Beaton's unique style
of photography,

40:25.827 --> 40:29.158
it was felt,
would catch the eye.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.158
It was different to
the normal press photography.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.558
They regularly used
five photographers,

40:35.560 --> 40:38.158
and Beaton
is the most celebrated.

40:41.728 --> 40:44.826
He still felt
that sense of shame

40:44.828 --> 40:51.558
for what he had done in 1938
with American <i> Vogue.</i>

40:51.560 --> 40:55.391
He genuinely did long
for redemption.

40:55.393 --> 40:58.292
And it's really
only the war years

40:58.294 --> 41:00.658
that sort of save
his reputation

41:00.660 --> 41:02.692
'cause he does go
out of his way to be

41:02.694 --> 41:05.325
an extraordinary
documentary photographer

41:05.327 --> 41:07.859
from 1939 onwards.

41:09.560 --> 41:14.392
During the war, Cecil Beaton
took over 7,000 photographs.

41:15.828 --> 41:18.626
He published eight books.

41:20.227 --> 41:23.492
Writing for innumerable
magazine features

41:23.494 --> 41:25.492
and articles,

41:25.494 --> 41:27.626
as well as drawing for them.

41:32.394 --> 41:36.825
That began to open the door
for Beaton to make a return,

41:36.827 --> 41:40.725
and it certainly made American <i>
Vogue</i> and British <i> Vogue</i>

41:40.727 --> 41:43.425
think that maybe
they ought to think again

41:43.427 --> 41:45.528
about employing him.

41:46.828 --> 41:52.659
I treated it always
in a sort of visual way.

41:52.661 --> 41:55.391
I think it was
a marvelous opportunity

41:55.393 --> 42:00.158
for me to be dug out
of my little rut.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.325
"I went to most
of the theaters of war.

42:03.327 --> 42:06.726
I went to Burma
and China and Egypt."

42:08.927 --> 42:11.158
"I remember
a most extraordinary sight

42:11.160 --> 42:13.625
when a whole lot of tanks
had been blown up

42:13.627 --> 42:15.224
and left there,

42:15.226 --> 42:17.192
and these strange
circular objects

42:17.194 --> 42:19.726
were half-buried
in the sand.

42:19.728 --> 42:23.158
They just remained looking
like a Surrealist picture."

42:36.260 --> 42:38.792
So different from
conventional war photography

42:38.794 --> 42:40.292
because he's an aesthete

42:40.294 --> 42:42.292
and he's looking
for beautiful things,

42:42.294 --> 42:45.558
even in extremis
and despair and hardship.

42:48.193 --> 42:51.692
Which is very, very powerful
and enduringly so, I think,

42:51.694 --> 42:53.826
it's just this idea that,
you know,

42:53.828 --> 42:55.925
culture and beauty
is going to survive

42:55.927 --> 42:57.659
whatever they throw at us.

43:16.627 --> 43:19.291
I think his sexuality
is extremely important

43:19.293 --> 43:22.592
in those photographs, because
the portrayals of, you know,

43:22.594 --> 43:24.924
the airmen and the soldiers
and the sailors

43:24.926 --> 43:28.159
are very, very loving

43:28.161 --> 43:30.858
and sometimes eroticized and...

43:32.861 --> 43:35.758
...and I think that's also
something that you don't get

43:35.760 --> 43:38.259
with conventional
war photography.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.359
"In the hangars of an aerodrome,

43:52.361 --> 43:54.424
I found more thrilling sets

43:54.426 --> 43:56.491
than in the Hollywood studios."

44:00.828 --> 44:04.291
"In the hospitals, there are
characters and personalities

44:04.293 --> 44:05.759
to be seen,

44:05.761 --> 44:08.758
more vivid than
in any stage drama."

44:10.528 --> 44:12.825
"With her little head bandaged,

44:12.827 --> 44:15.224
four-year-old
Eileen Dunne was in bed

44:15.226 --> 44:19.626
with wild, staring eyes
and a gray face

44:19.628 --> 44:22.659
and clutching a gray toy.

44:22.661 --> 44:25.591
Perhaps all that remained
of her former life."

44:30.294 --> 44:33.458
Becomes the cover
of <i> Life</i> magazine.

44:33.460 --> 44:39.158
You know, and it really does
help persuade American opinion

44:39.160 --> 44:41.792
in favor of helping out Europe.

44:47.361 --> 44:49.826
Beaton worked
extraordinarily hard

44:49.828 --> 44:53.159
and often fell ill.

44:53.161 --> 44:57.158
He traveled
in great discomfort.

44:57.160 --> 45:01.758
He was in a very serious
airplane crash.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.691
Before that he was like
a sugared almond,

45:04.693 --> 45:07.791
a sort of pretty little sweet,

45:07.793 --> 45:10.625
and then the inside of him
he was like a hard nut.

45:10.627 --> 45:13.224
And he just got on a plane,

45:13.226 --> 45:14.759
the plane crashed,

45:14.761 --> 45:16.759
he got out of that plane
and got on the next one,

45:16.761 --> 45:18.625
kept going, I mean,
that's an incredible...

45:18.627 --> 45:22.525
for that sort of foppish dandy,
that fondant piece of icing,

45:22.527 --> 45:25.391
he actually had
a very hard interior.

45:26.561 --> 45:28.325
Have you ever,
at any stage in your life,

45:28.327 --> 45:31.559
had to do something which was
really too difficult for you?

45:31.561 --> 45:33.758
Oh, I'm always
having to do things

45:33.760 --> 45:34.925
which are
too difficult for me,

45:34.927 --> 45:38.525
and I think that that is
the thing that keeps me going.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.225
I'm perfectly willing
to take on any job

45:41.227 --> 45:45.558
that I think may help
make me a little better

45:45.560 --> 45:47.259
as a human being.

45:58.393 --> 46:01.759
"Pelham Place,
my home in London,

46:01.761 --> 46:05.458
was no longer habitable.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.725
The street
was roped off

46:06.727 --> 46:11.258
with an unexploded bomb
in the vicinity.

46:11.260 --> 46:13.191
So I was
particularly blessed

46:13.193 --> 46:16.425
to have Ashcombe
as a retreat.

46:16.427 --> 46:20.492
It became, more than ever,
a refuge."

46:23.694 --> 46:26.626
When the time came,
eventually,

46:26.628 --> 46:29.525
for me to go
and see my landlord

46:29.527 --> 46:36.592
and to hear that he wanted
to take over the place,

46:36.594 --> 46:38.291
I... I just couldn't believe it.

46:38.293 --> 46:40.492
It was like a death knell.

46:40.494 --> 46:42.891
I couldn't imagine
that I would be expelled

46:42.893 --> 46:47.592
from this loveliness
that I had made my own.

47:05.161 --> 47:07.691
"I've been going through
all the old boxes."

47:09.826 --> 47:13.191
"The past comes alive
with shocking vividness."

47:19.760 --> 47:23.458
"Some of the letters
and documents make me sad.

47:23.460 --> 47:27.592
Some almost stop
my heart beating.

47:27.594 --> 47:30.491
The telegram announcing
my father's death."

47:32.460 --> 47:34.691
"A piece of paper
left on the hall table

47:34.693 --> 47:38.392
indicating that my brother,
Reggie, was out.

47:38.394 --> 47:41.424
He would never come back
to write that he was in."

47:46.394 --> 47:49.690
"The evening that Reggie was
killed by an underground train,

47:49.692 --> 47:51.425
I felt unmoved."

47:54.261 --> 47:58.626
"His suicide was the crowning
blow to my father's life.

47:58.628 --> 48:00.225
I thought,

48:00.227 --> 48:03.924
'Dear Daddy, what a
nightmare ordeal for you.'"

48:05.826 --> 48:08.424
"'Reggie was your favorite son.

48:08.426 --> 48:10.259
You'd been such friends.'"

48:15.693 --> 48:17.324
"I'm thinking now
of all the days

48:17.326 --> 48:19.558
Reggie and I
spent together.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.924
We grew up in great intimacy,

48:21.926 --> 48:25.291
fighting a lot
but really devoted.

48:25.293 --> 48:27.658
I feel full
of regret and guilt

48:27.660 --> 48:29.857
for having been so selfish."

48:37.827 --> 48:39.825
His mother was very much
his responsibility

48:39.827 --> 48:43.159
after the father died.

48:43.161 --> 48:44.691
He was very protective
of his mother

48:44.693 --> 48:46.691
and very devoted to her.

48:46.693 --> 48:49.925
Wherever he lived,
she always had her own room

48:49.927 --> 48:52.259
and she was part
of the scenery.

48:54.394 --> 48:56.658
"Since I was thrown out
of Ashcombe,

48:56.660 --> 48:58.690
I have found a small house
in the country

48:58.692 --> 49:01.259
to take its place.

49:01.261 --> 49:03.658
Of course,
Reddish House did not possess

49:03.660 --> 49:07.724
the wayward romantic
remoteness of Ashcombe.

49:07.726 --> 49:11.757
This was the abode
of an adult person.

49:11.759 --> 49:14.891
Is it because it is my own
that I love it so much?"

49:18.561 --> 49:20.191
He not only grew up

49:20.193 --> 49:25.425
and began to value things
in life beyond himself,

49:25.427 --> 49:27.690
but it was also
the point at which

49:27.692 --> 49:30.291
his life
changed direction,

49:30.293 --> 49:35.159
which was less photography
and more about stage design.

49:40.893 --> 49:43.258
After the war, when he did
that famous production

49:43.260 --> 49:45.425
of the Wilde play <i>
Lady Windermere</i> '<i> s Fan,</i>

49:45.427 --> 49:48.224
I mean, that gave a glamour
after 1945,

49:48.226 --> 49:51.624
after the dreadful, dull, gray,

49:51.626 --> 49:56.558
bleak, ruined, shitty
kind of atmosphere.

49:56.560 --> 50:00.158
Post 1945,
suddenly to see this vision

50:00.160 --> 50:02.791
of Edwardian grandeur,
splendor,

50:02.793 --> 50:04.557
I mean, we needed that.

50:07.260 --> 50:09.392
"It was Diaghilev
who set me on the track

50:09.394 --> 50:11.491
of designing for the theater
and the ballet."

50:12.593 --> 50:15.424
"He was neither a dancer,
a painter,

50:15.426 --> 50:18.690
a choreographer,
nor a musician,

50:18.692 --> 50:20.691
but he had the vision,

50:20.693 --> 50:22.491
the taste,

50:22.493 --> 50:25.425
the knowledge to embrace
all these things."

50:27.592 --> 50:30.325
Cecil Beaton was inspired by

50:30.327 --> 50:33.292
the two great Russian icons
of ballet

50:33.294 --> 50:35.825
who came from
the same generation

50:35.827 --> 50:37.658
and were totally opposed
to each other...

50:37.660 --> 50:40.724
Anna Pavlova
and Serge Diaghilev.

50:40.726 --> 50:42.758
Ballet people talk about
the word "perfume,"

50:42.760 --> 50:45.292
and Anna Pavlova was
the ultimate perfume ballerina.

50:45.294 --> 50:47.624
She would leave essences
of herself,

50:47.626 --> 50:50.824
and had a wonderful quality
of upper body acting,

50:50.826 --> 50:52.625
so people thought
she was like a flame.

50:56.160 --> 50:57.758
The ballet I wish we could see

50:57.760 --> 51:00.158
is the original version
of <i> Apparitions.</i>

51:00.160 --> 51:02.591
Just see these extraordinary
splashes of color

51:02.593 --> 51:03.757
where the whole
corps de ballet,

51:03.759 --> 51:06.324
one section's wearing
purple and lilac,

51:06.326 --> 51:07.858
one section's wearing scarlet,

51:07.860 --> 51:10.790
and that gives us such an idea
of pure beauty.

51:15.293 --> 51:16.525
I don't think Cecil Beaton
was like

51:16.527 --> 51:17.658
anybody else
in the world of dance

51:17.660 --> 51:20.858
because he was a photographer
and he was a designer.

51:20.860 --> 51:24.457
I can't really think of people
who did those two things.

51:24.459 --> 51:27.158
But he was, you know, he was
a personality and opinion,

51:27.160 --> 51:29.691
and he was like all these
post-Diaghilev people,

51:29.693 --> 51:31.557
he was a dandy.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.525
Everything about him was style.

51:39.527 --> 51:42.857
The way he dressed,
the way the table was laid.

51:42.859 --> 51:44.825
The flowers in the house.

51:44.827 --> 51:48.725
All those little details
of a kind of dandy.

51:58.526 --> 52:00.658
It goes far beyond clothes.

52:00.660 --> 52:03.458
It's an attitude,
and in his case

52:03.460 --> 52:07.825
the way he documented
the world around him.

52:07.827 --> 52:09.825
Do you think you were,
when you were younger,

52:09.827 --> 52:12.292
abnormally self-conscious
about your appearance?

52:12.294 --> 52:14.325
- Oh yes.
- Are you still so?

52:14.327 --> 52:16.292
Luckily, no.

52:16.294 --> 52:19.590
I've got rid of the past
except for this hat.

52:21.527 --> 52:25.892
This hat I wear because
I think it has a certain...

52:25.894 --> 52:28.258
Edwardian bravura,

52:28.260 --> 52:32.525
and also it hides the fact
that I'm going bald.

52:32.527 --> 52:35.524
And I don't like to exhibit
myself quite bald, you know.

52:38.660 --> 52:42.457
Cecil had an aura about him
that really drew you in.

52:44.392 --> 52:46.625
He was extremely stylish,

52:46.627 --> 52:49.857
but he looked totally unlike
anybody else.

52:51.226 --> 52:53.690
He's both very vain

52:53.692 --> 52:56.225
and very modest
at the same time.

52:57.659 --> 53:01.791
He has a kind of social vanity,

53:01.793 --> 53:05.259
which is amusing and unique,
and I like it,

53:05.261 --> 53:07.457
and it's part of his charm.

53:07.459 --> 53:09.624
Am I vain?

53:09.626 --> 53:12.158
Oh no, anything but vain.

53:12.160 --> 53:16.192
I'm my worst critic.

53:16.194 --> 53:17.790
I've got this strange feeling
about vanity.

53:17.792 --> 53:21.423
I think vanity's
when you think you're perfect.

53:21.425 --> 53:23.158
And Cecil didn't think
he was perfect

53:23.160 --> 53:25.323
and tried to improve himself.

53:25.325 --> 53:27.457
But he was hugely critical.

53:27.459 --> 53:30.925
I think he thought some people
didn't rise to his standards.

53:37.227 --> 53:39.694
Who is the most beautiful woman
you've ever photographed?

53:41.294 --> 53:43.295
Uh, I suppose Garbo.

53:44.326 --> 53:46.891
"I am obsessed by her.

53:46.893 --> 53:48.824
The moment I wake
in the morning,

53:48.826 --> 53:50.525
I start to think about her,

53:50.527 --> 53:52.192
and so it goes on all day,

53:52.194 --> 53:55.491
and then in my dreams
at night."

53:55.493 --> 53:57.158
Don't speak.

54:01.425 --> 54:04.290
Miss Garbo, I always wanted
to photograph her,

54:04.292 --> 54:06.558
but she was very averse
to the idea

54:06.560 --> 54:11.159
until suddenly one day,
fate played into my lap

54:11.161 --> 54:13.424
and she said,

54:13.426 --> 54:18.558
"If only you weren't such a
grand and elegant photographer."

54:18.560 --> 54:20.258
So I said, "I suppose
then you'd ask me

54:20.260 --> 54:22.857
to take a passport photograph,
wouldn't you?"

54:22.859 --> 54:24.790
She said, "How did you know?"

54:25.894 --> 54:27.192
Well, the pictures I took

54:27.194 --> 54:29.658
weren't very suitable
for passport.

54:41.194 --> 54:42.824
They were
the most beautiful pictures,

54:42.826 --> 54:44.625
those pictures of Garbo,

54:44.627 --> 54:45.658
and they were loving,

54:45.660 --> 54:48.324
you could feel that
he just adored her, right,

54:48.326 --> 54:49.924
more than other subjects.

54:51.826 --> 54:53.690
These pictures of her
kind of sprawled out on a couch

54:53.692 --> 54:56.357
wearing a turtleneck
and this amazing bracelet.

54:58.426 --> 54:59.892
"She put a penciled line

54:59.894 --> 55:03.490
on the back of those
of which she approved,

55:03.492 --> 55:05.892
and would allow me to publish
one of them in <i> Vogue."</i>

55:10.726 --> 55:13.791
"A week before the magazine
was to be in all the bookstores,

55:13.793 --> 55:16.258
Greta sent me a cable

55:16.260 --> 55:19.825
saying that if more than one of
the photographs were to appear,

55:19.827 --> 55:21.858
I would never be forgiven."

55:26.492 --> 55:32.490
"Frantic calls to my friends
at <i> Vogue,</i> 'Stop everything!'

55:32.492 --> 55:35.158
It was too late,
the copies were already bound

55:35.160 --> 55:36.857
and on their way
throughout the country."

55:39.425 --> 55:42.625
"Through a complete
misunderstanding,

55:42.627 --> 55:44.757
it was now impossible
to prevent her

55:44.759 --> 55:47.424
from feeling
completely betrayed."

55:51.292 --> 55:54.691
"My abject cables, letters,
telephone calls,

55:54.693 --> 55:57.525
and flowers sent to her
were unanswered."

55:59.293 --> 56:01.858
There was a self-destructive
thing there,

56:01.860 --> 56:05.223
not in terms of his career

56:05.225 --> 56:07.257
or what he was doing
as an artist,

56:07.259 --> 56:11.324
much more about the destruction
of relationships, you know?

56:11.326 --> 56:14.290
This compulsion to make things
all the time

56:14.292 --> 56:15.458
is what drives your life,

56:15.460 --> 56:17.524
and you sacrifice
almost everything

56:17.526 --> 56:18.824
on the altar of that.

56:21.760 --> 56:24.324
Beaton is a creative force,

56:24.326 --> 56:27.424
and it's about creating
this illusory world

56:27.426 --> 56:32.290
that the viewer is invited
to step into.

56:32.292 --> 56:36.690
The idea of the scrapbook,
the collage, is pure Beaton.

56:39.626 --> 56:44.791
"So I have now 150 diaries
and 97 scrapbooks,

56:44.793 --> 56:48.158
memorials of
many violated magazines,

56:48.160 --> 56:50.924
repositories of
museum picture postcards,

56:50.926 --> 56:53.858
theatrical programs,
letters, and photographs

56:53.860 --> 56:56.424
which I have accumulated
since childhood."

57:01.859 --> 57:05.458
"If I could bring one thing
to a deserted island,

57:05.460 --> 57:08.423
I would choose
one of my scrapbooks,

57:08.425 --> 57:09.590
because they're full of pictures

57:09.592 --> 57:12.558
of people still alive
in my memory."

57:16.527 --> 57:18.757
"Finally, after six months,

57:18.759 --> 57:21.790
Greta called and left word
with my secretary

57:21.792 --> 57:24.258
that she would visit me
that afternoon."

57:25.727 --> 57:28.624
"My heart started to thump
so violently,

57:28.626 --> 57:30.424
it was almost alarming."

57:32.192 --> 57:36.290
Yes, I think there was some
hanky panky with Greta Garbo.

57:36.292 --> 57:37.691
Something happened,
I don't know what.

57:37.693 --> 57:40.423
It might have just been
a rather...

57:40.425 --> 57:42.458
awkward fumble on the sofa
or something,

57:42.460 --> 57:44.224
I don't know,
but something happened.

57:44.226 --> 57:47.324
He thought he could turn Garbo,

57:47.326 --> 57:49.657
and I think Garbo hoped
she could turn him.

57:49.659 --> 57:52.424
But I'm told actually
Cecil was quite good in bed

57:52.426 --> 57:53.557
with girls.

57:55.160 --> 57:58.558
"I had known that
we were made for each other."

57:59.827 --> 58:02.758
"I asked,
'Why don't you marry me?'"

58:04.559 --> 58:06.290
"I never asked anyone
to marry me,

58:06.292 --> 58:07.291
and yet to make this proposal

58:07.293 --> 58:10.491
seemed the most natural
and easy thing to do."

58:12.759 --> 58:15.423
"But Greta looked
completely astounded."

58:18.726 --> 58:21.690
Garbo, to some extent,
may well have been a lesbian,

58:21.692 --> 58:24.557
but she also had quite a lot
of relationships with men.

58:26.626 --> 58:29.257
The problem certainly about him
sort of settling down

58:29.259 --> 58:30.924
into one of
those cozy partnerships

58:30.926 --> 58:32.757
was unlikely to work
really very well

58:32.759 --> 58:33.758
because there was always

58:33.760 --> 58:36.558
some incredibly tempting
lighted candle somewhere

58:36.560 --> 58:38.791
which was more appealing.

58:40.425 --> 58:42.490
He had this vision
of what he wanted to be,

58:42.492 --> 58:45.127
and he was always in a hurry.

58:46.325 --> 58:48.424
"Anything for the uprise,"
as he once put it.

58:48.426 --> 58:52.290
He was very, very keen
to move in good social circles.

58:52.292 --> 58:54.157
He loved that royalty thing.

58:54.159 --> 58:55.557
I suppose if you looked
at it one way,

58:55.559 --> 58:57.223
it could be kind of endearing

58:57.225 --> 58:59.824
that he was so taken in
by all that stuff,

58:59.826 --> 59:03.223
and, uh, and I think
'cause of his background,

59:03.225 --> 59:06.691
he wanted to be part of
that group of people.

59:06.693 --> 59:08.257
If a person had a crown
on his head,

59:08.259 --> 59:10.158
he liked them much more.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.757
He was a terrible
social climber.

59:19.560 --> 59:21.658
"The call saying the Queen
wanted me to do

59:21.660 --> 59:24.290
her personal coronation
photographs

59:24.292 --> 59:26.357
comes as an enormous relief."

59:29.159 --> 59:32.924
By the time of the Queen's
coronation in 1953,

59:32.926 --> 59:36.590
Beaton was already world famous.

59:38.860 --> 59:42.925
He attended Westminster Abbey
for the ceremony itself.

59:42.927 --> 59:44.924
He was seated very high up
in the abbey,

59:44.926 --> 59:46.690
up near the organ pipes,

59:46.692 --> 59:49.557
and he had his top hat
stuffed full of sandwiches

59:49.559 --> 59:51.490
and drawing materials.

59:51.492 --> 59:56.191
And he recorded,
in very simple black sketches,

59:56.193 --> 59:59.290
the goings on in the abbey
as they unfolded before him.

59:59.292 --> 01:00:01.690
Long live the Queen!

01:00:01.692 --> 01:00:03.491
Long live
the Queen!

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.791
When you look at those pictures
of the Queen,

01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:14.824
particularly the color images,

01:00:14.826 --> 01:00:17.558
there's a real glow about her,

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.690
there's a sense that she's
almost radiating light.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.891
The image he created
of the monarchy

01:00:31.893 --> 01:00:34.324
was absolutely crucial,

01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:35.790
and his ability to create

01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:40.691
this seemingly magnificent,
unfolding tale

01:00:40.693 --> 01:00:43.690
of romance and glamour
was so important

01:00:43.692 --> 01:00:45.191
to inspire the nation.

01:00:48.892 --> 01:00:52.824
I don't know if he ever
became an insider himself,

01:00:52.826 --> 01:00:55.290
because I think
that he always saw himself

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:58.557
as beneath his subjects,
especially the royal family.

01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:01.690
He just felt so privileged
to be near them

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:03.691
in the same room, you know?

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.924
And I always found that
a little sad.

01:01:05.926 --> 01:01:09.191
But he's English,
so he knows his place.

01:01:11.727 --> 01:01:14.490
The British class system
is a very, very interesting

01:01:14.492 --> 01:01:17.290
and strange animal.

01:01:17.292 --> 01:01:19.157
If you were born
outside that world,

01:01:19.159 --> 01:01:20.158
that was just it,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.390
and you could be, you know,
a court jester,

01:01:22.392 --> 01:01:25.457
and you could be
a sort of entertainer

01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:28.724
and a recorder of it,

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:30.857
but you were never going to be
inside that world.

01:01:30.859 --> 01:01:34.557
Underneath it I think there was
always an insecure person.

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:36.591
You know,
he was never, ever confident

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:39.558
that people were accepting him.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.690
That's also a driving force.

01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:48.157
He published about 38 books
in his lifetime.

01:01:48.159 --> 01:01:50.291
Some of them obviously
were very visual,

01:01:50.293 --> 01:01:52.391
some of them were
more like diaries.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.358
I think there are
photographers and stylists

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.323
and certainly designers

01:01:58.325 --> 01:02:00.923
who have referenced Beaton
heavily through the years.

01:02:02.026 --> 01:02:04.424
That incredible book,<i>
The Glass of Fashion,</i>

01:02:04.426 --> 01:02:05.591
changed my life.

01:02:07.292 --> 01:02:09.258
He's able to do
these incredible drawings,

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.790
and it's great writing.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.424
I was 18 and I got a job
as an archivist

01:02:17.426 --> 01:02:19.890
in the <i> Vogue</i> Beaton archive.

01:02:19.892 --> 01:02:22.324
It was my job
to look at the negatives,

01:02:22.326 --> 01:02:23.490
hold them up to a light

01:02:23.492 --> 01:02:26.157
and try and choreograph them

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:29.290
to the Beaton pictures
on the page in the magazine.

01:02:29.292 --> 01:02:30.691
Of course it rubbed off on me.

01:02:34.325 --> 01:02:38.824
I think it was Beaton's romance
that attracted me.

01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:44.491
Human beings feed off
escapism and fantasy

01:02:44.493 --> 01:02:47.357
in a reaction
to the harshness of reality.

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:50.924
I think there's a sort of
nobility to fantasy

01:02:50.926 --> 01:02:52.157
for that reason.

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:58.158
He opened my eyes
to photography,

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.756
and I then realized

01:03:00.758 --> 01:03:04.657
there are some
good portrait photographers.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.923
Beaton used the camera
in a very particular way.

01:03:09.925 --> 01:03:14.158
Really what mattered to him
was always the subject.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.591
Seizing, freezing, holding
that beauty, that glamour,

01:03:18.593 --> 01:03:20.658
that idea.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:23.691
Creating this Beaton universe.

01:03:23.693 --> 01:03:25.923
It's not the world
as he found it,

01:03:25.925 --> 01:03:28.391
it's the world
as he transformed it,

01:03:28.393 --> 01:03:29.591
as he wished it to be.

01:03:34.626 --> 01:03:36.724
One of the greatest
contributions

01:03:36.726 --> 01:03:39.157
to the quality of <i> Gigi</i>

01:03:39.159 --> 01:03:44.558
is the fact that the producer
hired Cecil Beaton

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.789
to do everything visual
in the film.

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:53.689
Can you imagine what that was
like for Cecil Beaton?

01:03:53.691 --> 01:03:56.158
Going to a soundstage
where you could just create

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.890
absolutely anything,
carte blanche.

01:03:59.893 --> 01:04:01.457
That's like a fantasy,

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:03.357
that's like being in
the biggest space in the world

01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:05.891
and someone saying, like,
"Just create your own reality."

01:04:05.893 --> 01:04:07.823
Hello, Grandmama.

01:04:07.825 --> 01:04:10.358
Gigi, where have you been?

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.690
- Playing in the park.
- Armenonville.

01:04:12.692 --> 01:04:15.657
A lot of the picture
was shot in Paris,

01:04:15.659 --> 01:04:17.757
and then we went back
to Hollywood

01:04:17.759 --> 01:04:19.790
just for the interiors.

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:23.624
It was the first time that
I've ever worked as a designer

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.856
in a major Hollywood studio.

01:04:25.858 --> 01:04:29.823
You can ask the impossible
and it suddenly appears.

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:32.856
Look, Gaston.

01:04:32.858 --> 01:04:35.857
Four yards of material
in the skirt.

01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:38.458
Cecil didn't miss a minute.

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.357
He was there every day
from seven o'clock on.

01:04:43.359 --> 01:04:47.923
And then while we were shooting,
he would take pictures.

01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:49.324
"More than anyone else,

01:04:49.326 --> 01:04:51.823
Leslie Caron poses
the question,

01:04:51.825 --> 01:04:55.458
'What makes a face photogenic?'

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.857
In life and onstage,

01:04:57.859 --> 01:05:00.424
we see a delightful
little frog."

01:05:01.258 --> 01:05:03.690
"In the twinkling
of a flashbulb,

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:05.724
we see a photograph
of a beauty."

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:14.591
Beaton entered into my realm
subliminally when I was a kid.

01:05:14.593 --> 01:05:19.557
I think that, of the films
that I love of Beaton's,

01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:22.458
the one that I love the most
is <i> My Fair Lady.</i>

01:05:32.459 --> 01:05:36.324
When they came to me
with <i> My Fair Lady,</i>

01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:39.290
I just knew that
I'd really got something

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:41.558
that I'd always
been wishing for.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.324
It was really a question

01:05:45.326 --> 01:05:49.589
of delving down into the...
my youth, into my childhood,

01:05:49.591 --> 01:05:51.257
into my adolescence.

01:05:54.426 --> 01:05:56.689
My mother took me to see <i>
My Fair Lady,</i>

01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:58.756
and I remember the credits
coming up.

01:06:00.527 --> 01:06:05.257
I also remember thinking that
he'd got it all horribly wrong

01:06:05.259 --> 01:06:07.358
by giving the Ascot ladies

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.290
that... those kind of early
sixties Cleopatra winged eyes.

that that was entirely un-1912.

♪ I have never been
so keyed up ♪

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:29.756
So I was a little bit tut tutty

01:06:29.758 --> 01:06:31.623
But I...

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:32.524
which is a little bit scary

01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:34.823
considering I was seven
or eight, I think.

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:39.191
Um, but of course
I later came to realize

01:06:39.193 --> 01:06:42.723
that as an ensemble,
it was quite remarkable.

You could argue that
after Eliza Doolittle

01:06:59.325 --> 01:07:01.257
learns how to speak properly,

01:07:01.259 --> 01:07:03.524
Cecil carries the rest
of the film completely.

01:07:03.526 --> 01:07:06.323
And it's all visual,
really, after that.

01:07:06.325 --> 01:07:08.424
On top of being a photographer,
on top of being a writer,

01:07:08.426 --> 01:07:09.924
he was a painter.

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:13.790
And that color sense
that Beaton had was marvelous.

01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:17.824
For me, if you get the color
right, you have it.

01:07:20.159 --> 01:07:22.523
The one production that one
tends to associate with you

01:07:22.525 --> 01:07:24.390
above all others is <i>
My Fair Lady,</i>

01:07:24.392 --> 01:07:26.191
both the play and the film,

01:07:26.193 --> 01:07:28.257
which won you, I think,
two Oscars.

01:07:28.259 --> 01:07:30.557
I got the impression that when
it came to doing the film,

01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:32.823
you were less happy
in Hollywood.

01:07:32.825 --> 01:07:35.657
I loved the preparation.

01:07:35.659 --> 01:07:37.789
I thought that was
the most exciting thing

01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:41.424
because I was rethinking
the whole production.

01:07:41.426 --> 01:07:45.924
But unfortunately,
once we started shooting,

01:07:45.926 --> 01:07:49.291
I felt disappointed

01:07:49.293 --> 01:07:55.158
with certain personal aspects
of the whole set up.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.456
He was quite wound up
over in Los Angeles,

01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:58.556
'cause he hated it.

01:07:58.558 --> 01:08:00.690
"Oh, that terrible
George Cukor.

01:08:00.692 --> 01:08:02.423
Such a nightmare."

01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:04.357
I gather that you really
didn't get on very well

01:08:04.359 --> 01:08:06.258
with Cecil Beaton.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.657
No, I didn't.

01:08:08.659 --> 01:08:09.891
Would you like
to expand on that?

01:08:09.893 --> 01:08:11.857
No, no, it's a boring subject.

01:08:11.859 --> 01:08:14.190
I'm sure he's bored with it,
and so am I.

01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:15.857
No, no.

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.421
- But...
- Except he did pick my pockets.

01:08:18.424 --> 01:08:20.290
And he attempted
to strangle me,

01:08:20.292 --> 01:08:23.291
and he's a forger
and everything.

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:26.421
No, no, it just...
we just didn't get on very well.

01:08:26.424 --> 01:08:27.622
And I was right.

01:08:32.425 --> 01:08:34.823
"I really suffocated
in Hollywood."

01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:38.856
"It is ugly beyond belief,

01:08:38.858 --> 01:08:40.224
and there were very few people

01:08:40.225 --> 01:08:42.358
with whom I could speak
the same language."

01:08:47.826 --> 01:08:49.689
"It is two years
since that night

01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:53.724
when at that strange locale,
among the black leather toughs,

01:08:53.725 --> 01:08:56.788
one very beautiful fawnlike
creature in olive green

01:08:56.791 --> 01:09:00.790
smiled the sweetest,
most tender of smiles at me."

01:09:04.192 --> 01:09:07.524
I think Cecil was very much
in love with Kin Hoitsma.

01:09:07.526 --> 01:09:10.157
He was like a schoolgirl
with Kin.

01:09:10.158 --> 01:09:12.256
He was all...
I remember in the pool,

01:09:12.259 --> 01:09:14.823
and Kin would sort of
pick up Cecil in his arms,

01:09:14.826 --> 01:09:16.358
and Cecil, "Yeah," like that.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.788
I mean, he was so
sort of girly with Kin.

01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:22.924
"He was a continuous delight
to the eye,

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:26.189
full of laughter,
unspoiled,

01:09:26.192 --> 01:09:28.723
enchantingly young
and coltish,

01:09:28.725 --> 01:09:31.689
and ceaselessly beautiful.

01:09:31.692 --> 01:09:35.656
He was my most prized
possession."

01:09:37.358 --> 01:09:40.689
I don't think that Kin brought
out the best in Cecil Beaton.

01:09:40.692 --> 01:09:43.256
At that point,
Cecil was experimenting

01:09:43.259 --> 01:09:47.524
with a whole new generation,
a whole new life.

01:09:47.526 --> 01:09:49.191
He must have felt
that this gave him

01:09:49.193 --> 01:09:51.823
a sort of
a great youthful boost,

01:09:51.825 --> 01:09:55.158
but that's not a very good basis
for a long-term relationship.

01:09:57.559 --> 01:10:00.422
"Kin's exit was as if
to an execution."

01:10:01.691 --> 01:10:04.824
"I like to think it was
as bad a moment for him

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.291
as it was for me."

01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:12.390
"I went back to bed,

01:10:12.392 --> 01:10:15.190
not to sleep
but to moan at my loss

01:10:15.192 --> 01:10:17.457
and to feel desperately sad."

01:10:21.358 --> 01:10:24.423
I think he always wanted
to have a longstanding romance,

01:10:24.425 --> 01:10:26.589
and it never really worked.

01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:30.157
I mean, the... he really was
in love with Peter Watson

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.923
all his life, I think.

01:10:31.925 --> 01:10:34.258
Kin was not unlike Peter Watson
in a funny way.

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.323
Same sort of look.

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:38.258
Cecil Beaton seems
to have had a knack

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.422
of being a pretty bad chooser,

01:10:40.424 --> 01:10:42.890
and maybe we see a little thread
going through all this

01:10:42.892 --> 01:10:44.891
that perhaps, you know,
subconsciously

01:10:44.893 --> 01:10:47.157
he didn't really want
to settle down with any of them.

01:10:51.559 --> 01:10:52.423
Cecil Beaton, I suppose,

01:10:52.425 --> 01:10:55.924
was basically homosexual
without a doubt,

01:10:55.926 --> 01:11:00.322
but he always realized that he
was on the outside of society.

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:02.489
Cecil was definitely gay

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.158
in a time when it was
against the law.

01:11:05.591 --> 01:11:09.290
He did have a physical life,

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:13.790
but it was very behind
closed doors.

01:11:13.792 --> 01:11:16.524
He had one
regular black gentleman

01:11:16.526 --> 01:11:19.289
that he used to visit
quite frequently.

01:11:20.858 --> 01:11:22.656
But he was very discreet
about it.

01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:30.158
I think he was genuinely curious
about other people,

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.289
and felt inspired
by great artists.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:38.356
He saw himself
in that sort of constellation

01:11:38.358 --> 01:11:41.289
of great creative people.

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:43.556
You didn't have
to be madly beautiful

01:11:43.558 --> 01:11:45.389
to appeal to Cecil Beaton.

01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:47.890
What he liked was people
who expressed themselves.

01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:50.523
But he was a very good friend
to his friends,

01:11:50.525 --> 01:11:53.322
and his friends were
very, very loyal to him.

01:11:53.324 --> 01:11:55.356
From the beginning,
I've known him all my life,

01:11:55.358 --> 01:11:56.724
he's a friend of a lifetime,

01:11:56.726 --> 01:11:58.823
he always wanted
a very good life,

01:11:58.825 --> 01:12:00.789
and he realized there's
only one very good life,

01:12:00.791 --> 01:12:02.689
and that's the life
that you know you want

01:12:02.691 --> 01:12:03.723
and you make it yourself.

01:12:03.725 --> 01:12:04.757
That's what he's done.

01:12:04.759 --> 01:12:05.890
Don't you think?

01:12:05.892 --> 01:12:08.289
Yes, well,
he's a total self-creation.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:09.824
- Mm, total.
- There are very few people

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:12.257
in the world that are
total self-creations,

01:12:12.259 --> 01:12:13.789
and he certainly is one.

01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:15.689
You see, what I like
about Cecil,

01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:19.357
he's got a great deal
of the outrageous in him.

01:12:19.359 --> 01:12:21.257
He likes all the limits,
doesn't he?

01:12:21.259 --> 01:12:23.657
Well, he certainly goes
to extremes.

01:12:23.659 --> 01:12:25.423
- Yes.
- He can be extremely kind

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:26.923
or extremely rude.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:30.222
He can be the rudest person
I've ever known.

01:12:30.224 --> 01:12:32.556
Yes, and he picks his enemies
beautifully, doesn't he?

01:12:32.558 --> 01:12:36.257
Mm? He knows what he's doing
when he's doing those things.

01:12:36.259 --> 01:12:37.689
I wonder, though, really,

01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:40.222
I mean,
he certainly gathers enemies

01:12:40.224 --> 01:12:41.924
like other people gather roses.

01:12:41.926 --> 01:12:43.824
- That's right.
- I'm not so sure

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.556
that he picks them well.

01:12:45.558 --> 01:12:48.156
But he's very positive,
he's not a negative person.

01:12:48.158 --> 01:12:49.690
He loves, it's very easy
for him to love.

01:12:49.692 --> 01:12:53.690
Well, he positively loves you
or he positively hates you.

01:12:53.692 --> 01:12:57.356
Are there any close friends
from either school or Cambridge

01:12:57.358 --> 01:12:58.923
that you've carried right
the way through with you

01:12:58.925 --> 01:13:01.156
and are still
close friends today?

01:13:01.158 --> 01:13:02.757
Yes.

01:13:02.759 --> 01:13:04.756
Um, enemies?

01:13:04.758 --> 01:13:07.157
Yes.

01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:09.293
No names, I suppose,
no (UNINTELLIGIBLE)?

01:13:10.859 --> 01:13:12.724
Uh, I don't mind
giving a few names

01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:14.156
- if you want.
- Tell me a few names

01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:15.257
of friends and enemies

01:13:15.259 --> 01:13:17.556
who've been with you
all the time.

01:13:17.558 --> 01:13:20.289
Well, um...

01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:24.222
Evelyn Waugh, uh, is my enemy.

01:13:24.224 --> 01:13:27.490
We dislike one another
intensely.

01:13:27.492 --> 01:13:31.256
He thinks that
I'm a nasty piece of goods,

01:13:31.258 --> 01:13:34.157
and, oh, brother,
I feel the same way about him.

01:13:36.492 --> 01:13:38.289
"As for Noël Coward,

01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:41.423
I admire everything
about his work.

01:13:41.425 --> 01:13:43.157
Why then have I hated him?"

01:13:44.293 --> 01:13:47.556
"Perhaps I was envious
of the success of his career."

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:52.823
"I've always despised
the Burtons

01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:54.689
for their vulgarity,
commonness,

01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:57.422
and crass bad taste.

01:13:57.424 --> 01:13:59.624
Richard Burton is
as butch and coarse

01:13:59.626 --> 01:14:01.556
as only a Welshman can be."

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:06.290
"Elizabeth Taylor is
everything I dislike,

01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:09.556
combining the worst of
American and English taste."

01:14:12.258 --> 01:14:15.724
"Katharine Hepburn's appearance
is appalling.

01:14:15.726 --> 01:14:20.223
A freckled, burned, mottled,
bleached, and wizened piece

01:14:20.225 --> 01:14:22.423
of decaying matter.

01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:27.289
She has no generosity,
no heart, no grace.

01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:29.157
She's a dried up boot."

01:14:32.558 --> 01:14:33.857
Oh, yes, I can hate.

01:14:33.859 --> 01:14:36.257
I can hate unreasonably.

01:14:36.259 --> 01:14:38.490
I mean,
I'm very conscious of that.

01:14:38.492 --> 01:14:40.457
And then a lot of the time
I feel,

01:14:40.459 --> 01:14:42.556
well, I'm only doing it
just for a gag,

01:14:42.558 --> 01:14:44.322
that I really don't hate
this person,

01:14:44.324 --> 01:14:46.489
that it's just a sort of game

01:14:46.491 --> 01:14:48.456
I'm playing with myself
about them,

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:50.222
but clearly they're not too bad.

01:14:50.224 --> 01:14:53.289
But I take a line about
certain people and stick to it.

01:14:54.925 --> 01:14:57.924
I think he could be
very disapproving.

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:01.589
You'd suddenly see
a little flash of...

01:15:01.591 --> 01:15:03.257
bitchiness.

01:15:03.259 --> 01:15:06.557
There's a way the English have
of being rude in a nice way

01:15:06.559 --> 01:15:08.823
where you actually quite like
them being rude to you.

01:15:08.825 --> 01:15:11.557
And Cecil didn't have that
rudeness, he just had rudeness.

01:15:15.292 --> 01:15:18.689
I actually really loved Cecil.

01:15:18.691 --> 01:15:21.422
I had a huge soft spot
for him.

01:15:21.424 --> 01:15:26.556
I think that was something
to do with his melancholy side.

01:15:26.558 --> 01:15:28.824
He never gave the impression
of being a happy person,

01:15:28.826 --> 01:15:30.524
although he had a lot of humor

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:34.623
and he was... he engaged with
people very, very easily.

01:15:34.625 --> 01:15:37.523
I think that probably love,
or the lack of love,

01:15:37.525 --> 01:15:39.489
was an enormous part
of his life.

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:42.389
Maybe he didn't open his heart
very much.

01:15:42.391 --> 01:15:44.924
He was very hard to read,

01:15:44.926 --> 01:15:46.857
and I think like probably

01:15:46.859 --> 01:15:49.724
most interesting people
in the world,

01:15:49.726 --> 01:15:53.724
he was just this sort of
mass of contradictions.

01:15:53.726 --> 01:15:55.357
Let's face it,
he was two faced.

01:15:55.359 --> 01:15:58.689
I remember one weekend
I was staying with Cecil Beaton

01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:01.289
and he spotted this woman
outside the door and he said,

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:03.256
"Oh, it's that fucking woman!"

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:05.289
Opening the door,
"Mary, darling,

01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.823
it's so wonderful to see you."

01:16:06.825 --> 01:16:08.624
That got him in one.

01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:15.923
Supposing you had to judge
yourself from your diaries,

01:16:15.925 --> 01:16:19.556
what sort of man do you think
you'd find there?

01:16:19.558 --> 01:16:21.689
Were you a bit shocked
when you looked back

01:16:21.691 --> 01:16:23.824
on the early ones?

01:16:23.826 --> 01:16:28.489
Um, I really looked upon them
from a technical point of view.

01:16:28.491 --> 01:16:32.422
I came across this hoard
and I started reading them,

01:16:32.424 --> 01:16:38.790
and I was appalled by the person
that was revealed there.

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:42.323
But suddenly,
there would be a little patch

01:16:42.325 --> 01:16:45.156
that I thought had
great vitality,

01:16:45.158 --> 01:16:47.724
that still seemed to...

01:16:47.726 --> 01:16:49.289
be valid,

01:16:49.291 --> 01:16:53.156
and so I collected them
together.

01:16:53.158 --> 01:16:57.523
And even if I came out of them
in a pretty unbecoming light,

01:16:57.525 --> 01:16:59.156
and I thought
they were interesting,

01:16:59.158 --> 01:17:00.689
then I let them go in.

01:17:00.691 --> 01:17:02.824
Of course the most notorious
example of that

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:04.524
was when he published
his diaries

01:17:04.526 --> 01:17:06.156
about the affair
with Greta Garbo,

01:17:06.158 --> 01:17:08.590
because he thought it was a very
important part of his life

01:17:08.592 --> 01:17:09.823
and it couldn't be ignored.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.557
Well, she was
a very, very private person,

01:17:11.559 --> 01:17:14.157
and that did not go down well
either with her

01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:15.723
or with a great number
of other people

01:17:15.725 --> 01:17:19.256
who considered that he had not
behaved like a gentleman.

01:17:19.258 --> 01:17:22.856
I do find that my opinion
changes very much

01:17:22.858 --> 01:17:24.456
as time goes by,

01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:26.457
and I'm always
sort of reconsidering,

01:17:26.459 --> 01:17:30.156
and I think perhaps
I've been much too outspoken

01:17:30.158 --> 01:17:31.789
on rather trivial subjects.

01:17:34.658 --> 01:17:37.357
That's marvelous, Penelope,
just like that.

01:17:37.359 --> 01:17:39.457
Good, your fingers straighter.

01:17:39.459 --> 01:17:40.689
And head a bit higher.

01:17:40.691 --> 01:17:42.624
That's right, now then
will you follow me?

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:50.823
I want you to look ecstatic,
you must be inspired.

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:53.457
Don't smile, no, very serious.

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.790
Jolly good,
jolly well done.

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:20.922
I think you're absolutely super.

01:18:20.924 --> 01:18:24.556
I was with David Bailey when
he decided to do a documentary

01:18:24.558 --> 01:18:25.756
on Cecil Beaton.

01:18:28.759 --> 01:18:30.889
You know, I didn't like him,
Cecil.

01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:32.423
He was such a snob.

01:18:32.425 --> 01:18:34.724
But I thought he was
a great photographer

01:18:34.726 --> 01:18:36.757
and a great designer.

01:18:36.759 --> 01:18:38.789
That's absolutely marvelous.

01:18:38.791 --> 01:18:40.557
- Precioso.
- Oh...

01:18:40.559 --> 01:18:43.790
Cecil was very patient
with Bailey,

01:18:43.792 --> 01:18:47.422
but I think that Beaton
absolutely loathed Bailey.

01:18:47.424 --> 01:18:49.290
- All right?
- No.

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:52.223
In a way, you have to sort of
get the person in the film

01:18:52.225 --> 01:18:53.423
when you're making a film
about them.

01:18:53.425 --> 01:18:55.823
- Thank you.
- Good, and walk towards me.

01:18:55.825 --> 01:18:56.956
- Walk towards you?
- Yeah.

01:18:56.958 --> 01:19:00.222
Drag them in, in a way,
even if you have to annoy them.

01:19:00.224 --> 01:19:01.889
- Good.
- That's right.

01:19:01.891 --> 01:19:04.788
"Bailey, your film
is entertaining

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:07.290
and is of good value.

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:09.724
But it is not a good film.

01:19:09.726 --> 01:19:13.556
It is inconclusive
and superficial."

01:19:13.558 --> 01:19:15.290
Well, I got him then, didn't I?

01:19:19.424 --> 01:19:22.422
Right on the head, maybe
it's too close to home, Cecil,

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.423
if you're listening up there
with God,

01:19:25.425 --> 01:19:27.822
decorating His front room.

01:19:31.825 --> 01:19:34.624
A lot of people just dismissed,

01:19:34.626 --> 01:19:37.389
you know,
younger successful people

01:19:37.391 --> 01:19:41.623
as being flash in the pans
or pop culture,

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:45.390
but Cecil, you know,
he knew what talent was,

01:19:45.392 --> 01:19:48.690
and he... you know,
he followed that.

01:19:48.692 --> 01:19:52.788
He was photographing
the great modern artists

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:54.422
of the post-war years.

01:19:54.424 --> 01:19:59.623
Bacon and Freud
and Gilbert & George.

01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:02.323
Well, he loved anything,
anything new.

01:20:02.325 --> 01:20:04.290
Loved youth.

01:20:04.292 --> 01:20:07.788
Good, uh, just lean forward
like that awful advertisement,

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:10.423
"Your cigarette, sir."

01:20:11.591 --> 01:20:14.523
He came in
the Royal College of Art

01:20:14.525 --> 01:20:16.788
when I was a student.

01:20:17.925 --> 01:20:20.623
I knew he was an old queen.

01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:24.524
I knew a few things about him.

01:20:25.526 --> 01:20:30.256
Then he told me
he wanted to buy this painting.

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:32.756
He offered me 40 pounds for it,

01:20:32.758 --> 01:20:38.356
which I'd never had 40 pounds
for a painting before.

01:20:38.358 --> 01:20:44.688
And so I used that money to come
to America the first time, yeah.

01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:46.823
Look out of the false window.

01:20:46.825 --> 01:20:49.189
"It staggers me
how this young man

01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:51.556
can be so at home in the world.

01:20:51.558 --> 01:20:55.788
He has the golden quality
of being able to enjoy life."

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:56.855
Scintillating.

01:20:56.857 --> 01:20:58.889
"He is never blasé,

01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:01.657
never takes anything
for granted.

01:21:01.659 --> 01:21:04.557
Life is a delightful
wonderland for him."

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:06.656
And then just look at me.
That's right.

01:21:06.658 --> 01:21:09.922
I mean, I did get to know him
quite well.

01:21:09.924 --> 01:21:11.789
I had to sketch him for <i> Vogue,</i>

01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:14.723
and he photographed me.

01:21:14.725 --> 01:21:17.756
So the drawings
took a long time.

01:21:17.758 --> 01:21:21.856
I remember if he liked
the drawing, I didn't.

01:21:21.858 --> 01:21:24.656
If I liked the drawing,
he didn't.

01:21:25.824 --> 01:21:27.656
He never really rested.

01:21:27.658 --> 01:21:29.557
I don't see how
he did everything

01:21:29.559 --> 01:21:31.422
and went out every night.

01:21:31.424 --> 01:21:34.290
It's extraordinary
how much he got done.

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:41.189
"I have always complimented
myself on my stamina,

01:21:41.191 --> 01:21:43.557
and can wear out
even my younger friends

01:21:43.559 --> 01:21:45.756
when it comes to work or play."

01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:49.756
"I can still think of myself

01:21:49.758 --> 01:21:53.289
as a rather appealing
bright young thing."

01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:55.755
Look at Hockney,
you see he's giggling away.

01:21:55.757 --> 01:21:57.289
I love his green shirt.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:59.822
I went to Cecil's parties.

01:21:59.824 --> 01:22:01.557
Get him out of here.

01:22:01.559 --> 01:22:05.256
I mean,
I met all kinds of people there.

01:22:05.258 --> 01:22:07.489
I met Vivien Leigh there,

01:22:07.491 --> 01:22:09.322
Laurence Olivier,

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:12.157
loads of film people.

01:22:12.159 --> 01:22:16.556
That's where I met Mick Jagger,
at Cecil Beaton's.

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:26.723
I first met Cecil Beaton
in part of Morocco

01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:30.788
which was little known then.

01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:32.688
I was walking in the medina
one day

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:37.190
and I saw this beautiful figure
clad all in a white suit

01:22:37.192 --> 01:22:39.289
and a beautiful fedora hat.

01:22:39.291 --> 01:22:40.622
It was very nice.

01:22:40.624 --> 01:22:42.156
Take some nice pictures.

01:22:47.224 --> 01:22:49.357
"Mick Jagger is sexy,

01:22:49.359 --> 01:22:52.356
yet completely sexless.

01:22:52.358 --> 01:22:54.556
He is beautiful and ugly,

01:22:54.558 --> 01:22:56.689
feminine and masculine.

01:22:56.691 --> 01:22:59.389
A rare phenomenon."

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.157
Cecil Beaton had a knack

01:23:01.159 --> 01:23:03.423
of always being in the right
place at the right time.

01:23:03.425 --> 01:23:06.289
You know, he wasn't having
a siesta in the hotel

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:07.589
when the Rolling Stones
came by,

01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:09.788
he was out there
and he saw them

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:12.556
and he took their pictures
by the pool.

01:23:12.558 --> 01:23:14.422
Terribly good of Andy Warhol.

01:23:14.424 --> 01:23:16.290
I like that one the most.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:18.655
He continually embraced
what was exciting and new

01:23:18.657 --> 01:23:21.423
and modern and happening
and of the moment

01:23:21.425 --> 01:23:25.389
and up to the minute and with it
and swinging and hip.

01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:27.289
Delightful.

01:23:27.291 --> 01:23:29.290
The mind boggles to think
what he could have made

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:34.589
of today's internet,
Instagram, selfie world.

01:23:34.591 --> 01:23:39.856
I'd love to see a Beaton
portrait of Kim Kardashian,

01:23:39.858 --> 01:23:43.223
and I'd particularly like
to read the diary entry.

01:23:50.691 --> 01:23:54.156
"I come down to the country
by the earliest train possible."

01:23:56.891 --> 01:24:00.688
"The landscape is
everything I love,

01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:03.655
with dry grasses
in the hedges

01:24:03.657 --> 01:24:06.223
and all the cottage gardens
ablaze."

01:24:14.824 --> 01:24:17.390
When you found
the real Cecil,

01:24:17.392 --> 01:24:20.156
it was delightful.

01:24:20.158 --> 01:24:22.889
The real Cecil would come out
when he was home at Reddish,

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:27.622
in the garden with
his old garden clothes on.

01:24:27.624 --> 01:24:29.289
He was happy.

01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:32.522
There was no grandeur.

01:24:32.524 --> 01:24:34.855
He really was himself,

01:24:34.857 --> 01:24:36.656
which was very nice to see.

01:24:38.425 --> 01:24:39.555
Here's my little cat.

01:24:39.557 --> 01:24:42.922
He likes very much staying
in the herbaceous border.

01:24:42.924 --> 01:24:45.488
I wonder if I might be able
to get you.

01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:47.222
Come on, Timothy, yeah.

01:24:47.224 --> 01:24:50.423
Oh, I'm so pleased to see
a nice cat.

01:24:52.291 --> 01:24:54.157
Timothy White.

01:24:54.159 --> 01:24:56.655
Timothy White.

01:24:56.657 --> 01:25:01.156
I have no plans
for settling down at all.

01:25:01.158 --> 01:25:04.890
I think my idea of
a peaceful old age

01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:09.356
is continuing to experiment
and develop

01:25:09.358 --> 01:25:13.422
and tackle each new hurdle
as it comes along.

01:25:17.292 --> 01:25:19.156
London's
National Portrait Gallery

01:25:19.158 --> 01:25:22.190
is paying an unprecedented
compliment to Cecil Beaton

01:25:22.192 --> 01:25:25.223
with an exhibition of 700
of his portrait photographs.

01:25:26.657 --> 01:25:30.223
It was a landmark show.

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.555
It put Beaton
back in the limelight.

01:25:32.557 --> 01:25:34.189
It put
the National Portrait Gallery,

01:25:34.191 --> 01:25:38.256
up until then thought of as
the dowdiest gallery in London,

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:41.555
at the height
of glamour and excitement.

01:25:41.557 --> 01:25:45.689
And no national collection
had ever staged

01:25:45.691 --> 01:25:48.388
an exhibition of
a living photographer.

01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:51.822
So it put photography
on the map as never before.

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:59.456
"Barbra Streisand.

01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.889
She has star quality.

01:26:00.891 --> 01:26:02.556
She's a natural.

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:05.256
She is above all else
intelligent.

01:26:05.258 --> 01:26:08.655
Her brain works so clearly,
so healthily,

01:26:08.657 --> 01:26:10.189
she could be a lawyer."

01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:13.788
Would you have liked your life
all to be different?

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:14.923
Very different, yes.

01:26:16.059 --> 01:26:23.421
I think that I wish that
I were able to dig down deeper.

01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:27.822
I think that
I relied on my instinct

01:26:27.824 --> 01:26:31.688
and tried to perfect
my inner sense of reality,

01:26:31.690 --> 01:26:34.156
but I don't think
that I have made

01:26:34.158 --> 01:26:38.190
an intellectual enough approach

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:41.755
to my work and my life.

01:26:42.757 --> 01:26:45.822
And the winner is Cecil Beaton
for <i> Coco.</i>

01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:55.522
This is simply spiffy.

01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:00.290
I'm very lucky to get this.

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:03.290
I'm lucky because
I don't think any other designer

01:27:03.292 --> 01:27:06.823
has ever had such a marvelous
inspiration to work to

01:27:06.825 --> 01:27:09.556
as Mademoiselle Coco Chanel.

01:27:14.558 --> 01:27:17.289
Beaton's relationship
with the V&A Museum

01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:21.822
began when he was invited
to stage an exhibition

01:27:21.824 --> 01:27:25.223
called Fashion: An Anthology.

01:27:25.225 --> 01:27:26.455
It was a huge success.

01:27:26.457 --> 01:27:28.389
It was wildly popular.

01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:31.556
And it included garments
and clothing

01:27:31.558 --> 01:27:34.923
from virtually everyone
Cecil Beaton knew.

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.756
Cecil got a CBE in 1957.

01:27:41.758 --> 01:27:44.723
That's Companion of the Order
of the British Empire.

01:27:44.725 --> 01:27:47.889
And for a long time
he wasn't knighted.

01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:50.855
But what he actually said when
he did get knighted finally

01:27:50.857 --> 01:27:53.589
in 1972 was,

01:27:53.591 --> 01:27:55.421
"Oh, it's practically
posthumous."

01:27:57.524 --> 01:28:00.157
Good, and the hands, give it
a little more sort of...

01:28:01.658 --> 01:28:02.889
"As the years pass,

01:28:02.891 --> 01:28:06.556
I have found that I must work
harder than ever I did before."

01:28:06.558 --> 01:28:08.788
It's good, it's very nice.

01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:12.655
"The whole problem of the future
is one of anxiety."

01:28:27.691 --> 01:28:31.157
After a very intense
working career,

01:28:31.159 --> 01:28:33.356
Beaton suffered his stroke.

01:28:33.358 --> 01:28:35.156
He was greatly debilitated.

01:28:35.158 --> 01:28:37.589
He was paralyzed
down his right side

01:28:37.591 --> 01:28:42.289
and he never really got the use
of his right hand back.

01:28:44.223 --> 01:28:45.523
Worst of all perhaps for him

01:28:45.525 --> 01:28:48.623
is that he lost
his particular elegance,

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:50.421
and that he resented very much,

01:28:50.423 --> 01:28:52.756
and he was
very, very, very depressed.

01:28:57.158 --> 01:29:00.722
"It is awful how easily I weep.

01:29:00.724 --> 01:29:03.157
Why have I not
any self control?"

01:29:04.824 --> 01:29:08.255
"Suddenly I realized
I was appalled

01:29:08.257 --> 01:29:10.422
by the sadness of life."

01:29:12.591 --> 01:29:15.623
"I was weeping
for my own lost youth,

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:18.755
and I was weeping for
the dead people I had loved.

01:29:18.757 --> 01:29:20.788
My mother and my brother

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:23.422
and all who had been
part of my childhood."

01:29:28.457 --> 01:29:32.321
"Why should I feel sad
about the passing of so much

01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:35.688
rather than gratitude that so
much has been fitted into life?"

01:29:45.358 --> 01:29:49.222
He was on this endless quest
for something,

01:29:49.224 --> 01:29:50.556
not immortality

01:29:50.558 --> 01:29:53.455
but to achieve something
that he was proud of.

01:29:55.324 --> 01:29:57.156
But I feel in some kind of way

01:29:57.158 --> 01:30:00.288
that none of the things he did
really satisfied him.

01:30:01.591 --> 01:30:04.322
I don't think he thought
that he really...

01:30:04.324 --> 01:30:05.421
was all he could have been.

01:30:08.223 --> 01:30:11.856
He was so much more interesting
and so much more curious,

01:30:11.858 --> 01:30:15.923
and so much more complex
as a person.

01:30:15.925 --> 01:30:21.388
But I think that complexity
he had is what artists have.

01:30:22.558 --> 01:30:25.688
It's not... it's not
for the ordinary.

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:32.322
He gave up writing diaries

01:30:32.324 --> 01:30:35.655
when he had this bad stroke
in 1974,

01:30:35.657 --> 01:30:38.822
but there was actually
a post-stroke diary as well,

01:30:38.824 --> 01:30:42.289
because when I went to see Cecil
and Eileen, his secretary,

01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:45.421
they told me that they'd had
this terrible drama

01:30:45.423 --> 01:30:48.321
because the cat, Timothy,
after 17 years

01:30:48.323 --> 01:30:50.421
had had to be put to sleep.

01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:54.689
And when I actually got my hands
on the diary,

01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:57.321
the last thing Cecil Beaton
ever wrote was,

01:30:57.323 --> 01:30:59.855
"So Timothy has passed through
to oblivion.

01:30:59.857 --> 01:31:01.722
Is he perhaps the lucky one?"

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:05.289
And exactly a week later,

01:31:05.291 --> 01:31:07.355
he himself got flustered
in the night

01:31:07.357 --> 01:31:08.555
and out he went.

01:31:16.624 --> 01:31:18.489
Cecil Beaton died
at Reddish House

01:31:18.491 --> 01:31:21.288
on the 18th of January 1980.

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:24.155
There were three photographs
in his room when he died.

01:31:24.157 --> 01:31:26.755
One was of Peter Watson,
one was of Kin Hoitsma,

01:31:26.757 --> 01:31:27.790
and one was of Greta Garbo.

01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:30.421
Those were the three people
that he considered

01:31:30.423 --> 01:31:32.188
the great loves of his life.

01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:41.155
I was sad for him

01:31:41.157 --> 01:31:43.689
because I know
he would have hated dying.

01:31:45.591 --> 01:31:47.523
He loved life too much,

01:31:47.525 --> 01:31:50.588
and it would... he would have felt
he was missing something

01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:51.756
by being dead.

01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:09.556
His life was about
living for the wondrous,

01:32:09.558 --> 01:32:11.755
living for beauty,

01:32:11.757 --> 01:32:15.855
rejecting the banal,
rejecting the commonplace,

01:32:15.857 --> 01:32:19.622
and believing
that you can create a life,

01:32:19.624 --> 01:32:22.855
you can create a personality,
you can create a world

01:32:22.857 --> 01:32:24.788
for yourself
and those around you.

01:32:30.757 --> 01:32:35.455
No one has had the ability
to wave the wand

01:32:35.457 --> 01:32:39.222
and scatter the magic
over somebody like Cecil Beaton.

01:32:45.157 --> 01:32:49.556
He was uniquely connected
to so many different worlds,

01:32:49.558 --> 01:32:54.256
and it's always fascinating
having his perspective.

01:32:56.725 --> 01:33:00.822
The pointed observation that
someone else might have missed.

01:33:03.223 --> 01:33:07.756
It's very interesting to get
the unvarnished truth sometimes.

01:33:09.557 --> 01:33:13.822
And I think he could always
be relied upon to furnish that,

01:33:13.824 --> 01:33:18.421
you know, even in
his most private writings.

01:33:25.491 --> 01:33:28.155
"If I knew anyone
had read this,

01:33:28.157 --> 01:33:29.689
I'd almost go mad."

01:33:31.358 --> 01:33:33.588
"And yet I feel
I had to write it."

01:33:35.658 --> 01:33:38.823
"Perhaps
I have digressed in life.

01:33:38.825 --> 01:33:41.422
But what if one
doesn't want to specialize?"

01:33:45.323 --> 01:33:47.321
"Be daring."

01:33:48.591 --> 01:33:49.589
"Be different."

01:33:51.291 --> 01:33:52.389
"Be impractical."

01:33:54.158 --> 01:33:59.422
"Be anything that will assert
integrity of purpose

01:33:59.424 --> 01:34:03.488
and imaginative vision
against the play-it-safers,

01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:05.489
the slaves of the ordinary."

01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:15.288
"What if one is a dreamer?"
