11:34.606 --> 11:35.607
ROLAND:
Well, that's

11:35.782 --> 11:37.697
music to my ears, Your Honor.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.742
Roland Blum for the plaintiff...

11:39.916 --> 11:43.354
Your Honor, Mr. Blum has been
disbarred, and cannot...I'm-- oh,

11:43.528 --> 11:46.096
I'm sorry, I'm so--
Uh, I hadn't quite finished,

11:46.270 --> 11:47.968
Your Honor.
If I may?

11:48.142 --> 11:50.666
Uh, uh, yeah.
Ladies, we'll get to you.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.625
Uh, men like us, we...

11:53.800 --> 11:55.627
we go with our gut.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.804
My gut tells me

11:57.978 --> 12:00.284
not to get on a flight,
I listen.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.025
The plane goes down,
everyone gets killed,

12:02.199 --> 12:03.897
that's my gut saving my ass.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.550
[laughs]

12:05.725 --> 12:07.639
ROLAND: And what my gut
tells me here is that

12:07.814 --> 12:10.338
the defense is afraid of me.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.557
I've gathered
together

12:12.732 --> 12:15.256
a class of eightof their

12:15.430 --> 12:18.694
ex-clients. Eight. These
gentlemen here in the first row.

12:18.868 --> 12:22.176
Now they're suing because
they've had their futures

12:22.350 --> 12:24.613
stolen from them
by that law firm.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.615
Again, Your Honor,
Mr. Blum

12:26.789 --> 12:28.138
is disbarred.
He cannot argue in court.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.184
That's where these
ladies are wrong

12:30.358 --> 12:31.533
because I won't be
arguing in court.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.927
I'll leave that
to my associate,

12:34.101 --> 12:35.755
Maia Henson,

12:35.929 --> 12:39.149
who also used to work at
this law firm until she became

12:39.323 --> 12:41.717
disgusted and quit
because of their methods.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.110
LIZ:
Your Honor,

12:43.284 --> 12:45.068
this case is a vendetta
against our firm,

12:45.242 --> 12:47.114
and we ask that
the matter be dismissed.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.506
Not before you conduct
a hearing, Your Honor.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.856
TOOSI:
A hearing on what?

12:50.030 --> 12:51.596
We have a tape.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.121
TOOSI: A tape? Uh, like a,
like a tape you'd like to play?

12:54.295 --> 12:55.775
Like, a cassette tape?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.168
All right, do we have
a tape player? Bailiff?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.083
JULIUS [recorded]:
Expenses are expenses.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.172
PERRY: Between expenses and
your percentage, you come away

13:02.346 --> 13:04.479
with more than I do.
I'm living on the streets.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.698
JULIUS: Look, why
don't we do this?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.962
We got some contacts
at local Housing Services.

13:11.181 --> 13:14.576
Reddick/Boseman took 40%
of the award from Chicago PD.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.144
They then added frills on top,
amounting to another

13:17.318 --> 13:19.450
20% of that award.We contest that.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.365
Yes, and that's why
there needs to be a hearing.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.204
So what is this?
Retribution?

13:34.378 --> 13:36.598
No, it's lawyering.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.209
With Blum? Are you serious?

13:39.383 --> 13:42.473
No one else would
hire me, Diane.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.736
He made me a partner,
and I'm building his law firm

13:44.911 --> 13:46.608
from the ground up.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.263
Then why
come after us?

13:49.437 --> 13:51.526
Because you've done wrong.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.397
I mean, look at these cases.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.487
In all eight, you made
more money than your clients.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.446
In all eight, you had
a conflict of interest,

13:58.620 --> 14:00.100
and yet all the while,
you were still

14:00.274 --> 14:01.797
patting yourselves
on the back,

14:01.971 --> 14:05.279
thinking you were
fighting the good fight.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.498
And Blum is a friend
of the underprivileged?

14:07.672 --> 14:11.459
No, he's doing this
to destroy you.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.462
I'm doing this to reclaim money
for your ex-clients.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.771
I see you're still using
the portfolio I gave you.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.210
It still serves
its purpose.

14:35.309 --> 14:36.745
Aw.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.442
Mm.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.098
Mm.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.323
Kurt![door opens]

14:49.497 --> 14:50.802
KURT:
Oh, sorry.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.456
I-I didn't know you were
coming home early.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.850
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed,
Kurt. It's sweet.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.634
It's just
an assignment.

14:56.808 --> 14:57.853
What...

14:58.027 --> 15:01.726
What-- No!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.555
On behalf of the entire senior
staff around you, Mr. President,

15:04.729 --> 15:06.296
we thank you for the opportunity

15:06.470 --> 15:08.646
and the blessing that you've
given us to serve your agenda

15:08.820 --> 15:11.388
and the American people.Oh, my God.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.086
It's just something
I need to do.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.653
I thought this was for me.
It's for Trump?

15:15.827 --> 15:18.091
I'm supposed to introduce him
at the V.A. speech in Wisconsin.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.049
"The last two years
have brought me

15:20.223 --> 15:22.095
a new optimism"?

15:27.317 --> 15:29.667
Where you going?
Downstairs.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.714
There's too much of
a dent in that closet.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.981
I'd like to see if there's
a dollar amount

15:39.155 --> 15:41.027
that would help
Perry Cardwell

15:41.201 --> 15:43.551
and provide adequate
compensation

15:43.725 --> 15:46.858
to Maia and yourself.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.686
Well, thanks to
your efforts,

15:48.860 --> 15:51.776
I'm no longer permitted

15:51.951 --> 15:55.171
to be compensated
for the work I do.Mm.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.174
There's a way to structure
your end as a consulting fee,

15:58.348 --> 16:01.786
sidesteps the issue
of disbarment entirely.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.224
You know, sometimes

16:04.398 --> 16:07.618
you front the rectitude
of a priest,

16:07.792 --> 16:09.881
other times that of a pimp.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.579
It's whatever
works, right?

16:11.753 --> 16:13.450
Now what do you want?What do I want?

16:13.624 --> 16:15.496
[clears throat]

16:17.889 --> 16:20.153
I want

16:20.327 --> 16:23.199
a phalanx of moving men

16:23.373 --> 16:26.986
carrying files out that door.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.119
I want desks and
chairs sold off

16:30.293 --> 16:32.817
at a bankruptcyauction.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.646
I want associates and paralegals
and secretaries

16:35.820 --> 16:37.779
sending out their résumés,

16:37.953 --> 16:40.521
while partners sell their condos

16:40.695 --> 16:43.437
because they can't get the stink

16:43.611 --> 16:45.917
of Reddick/Boseman
off themselves.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.659
And how exactly

16:48.833 --> 16:52.576
is trying to destroy
our firm help you?

16:52.750 --> 16:57.190
You took away my livelihood...

16:57.364 --> 17:00.323
my trade.

17:00.497 --> 17:04.675
You made it so I was,
uh... [chuckles]

17:04.849 --> 17:06.634
nothing.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.028
If nothing else,

17:09.202 --> 17:10.594
destroying this firm
will let me

17:10.768 --> 17:13.467
unclench my teeth

17:13.641 --> 17:16.035
in the middle of the night.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.646
There is no
dollar amount

17:18.820 --> 17:21.388
that'd provide
adequate compensation.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.263
I want you gone.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.187
[door opens, closes]

17:47.327 --> 17:49.242
Several sightings of this rare
and potentially dangerous

17:49.416 --> 17:51.679
electrical phenomenon
known as "ball lightning"

17:51.853 --> 17:54.464
were reported in the
Chicago area yesterday.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.118
These balls started fires

17:56.292 --> 17:57.989
in three Chicago area
communities:

17:58.164 --> 18:00.209
Naperville, Wheaton, and also...

18:00.383 --> 18:01.863
Uh, what are
you watching?

18:02.037 --> 18:03.256
Lightning balls.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.693
C-Can I talk to you
for a second, Jay?

18:05.867 --> 18:08.870
Uh, lightning what?Balls.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.699
Balls of lightning.
They're outside of Chicago.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.658
I don't understand.
Is this a-a made-up thing?

18:14.832 --> 18:16.573
No, the severe weather
we've been having.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.401
Look.WEATHERMAN: If you spot
a ball of lightning

18:18.575 --> 18:21.535
coming your way, move out
of its path immediately.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.364
Okay, so one more thing
to deal with.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.888
Do you have a minute?

18:29.325 --> 18:31.327
[clears throat]

18:31.501 --> 18:33.982
What do people think of me here?

18:34.156 --> 18:36.854
[chuckles]
What do they think of you?

18:38.987 --> 18:40.989
[clears throat]

18:41.163 --> 18:43.165
[whispering]:
I'm up for partner...
Mm.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.689
...but apparently
I may not get it

18:45.863 --> 18:47.952
because they think

18:48.127 --> 18:50.694
I'm not "black enough."

18:50.868 --> 18:53.393
Who's saying that?The partners.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.047
Have you heard
anything?

18:56.222 --> 18:57.745
Not "black enough"
as compared to who?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.359
Rosalyn.

19:03.533 --> 19:07.276
Apparently she's pro-black
in a way that I'm not.

19:07.450 --> 19:10.540
Uh... Huh.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.504
Everyone likes you,

19:17.678 --> 19:20.724
just a lot of the associates
think you never hang out.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.814
[scoffs] So it's high school?

19:23.988 --> 19:26.600
I don't care
about being popular.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.732
Who has time to hang out?

19:28.906 --> 19:31.300
We're lawyers.
I have a ten-month-old baby.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.955
They thought that
before you had a baby.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.044
Okay, so I'm a traitor
to the race

19:36.218 --> 19:37.872
because I don't get drinks
after work?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.656
No, no, you get drinks.

19:39.830 --> 19:43.834
You just get them with Marissa
and Maia... and Colin.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.143
I wouldn't have come
to this firm if I weren't black.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.058
Mm, you're hovering
dangerously close to

19:50.232 --> 19:51.407
"my best friend is black."

19:53.583 --> 19:56.847
Okay. [chuckles]
You can go now.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.327
You asked my opinion.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.155
Yeah, well, you know what,
I shouldn't have

20:00.329 --> 20:01.722
because it doesn't matter.

20:01.896 --> 20:05.116
You know, I do not have
to prove myself to anyone

20:05.291 --> 20:08.816
or perform what they think
black should look like.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.427
This is 2019.

20:11.601 --> 20:14.778
I'm not playing
this stupid fucking game.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.476
Then why did you choose
Reddick/Boseman

20:16.650 --> 20:17.912
to represent you?

20:18.086 --> 20:19.870
They came to see me
after my arrest.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.134
They said they was the best
at taking it to the police.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.136
I really thought they was
gonna look after me.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.660
And what do you think now?I think they

20:26.834 --> 20:28.139
looked at me
and saw dollar signs.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.012
They charged me
for everything.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.580
$27,000 for trial
transcripts.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.973
$23,000 for dinners.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.976
A car service for
associates working late.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.500
Seriously?

20:40.674 --> 20:43.416
Is this your signature
right here?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.156
I guess.And, uh, this amount,

20:45.331 --> 20:47.637
$180,000,

20:47.811 --> 20:50.640
isn't that to cover the cost
of an expert witness?

20:50.814 --> 20:52.033
Objection,
Your Honor.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.774
The defense is asking
Mr. Cardwell

20:53.948 --> 20:55.732
a matter covered by
attorney-client privilege.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.560
Are you kidding?No, I'm not.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.910
Your Honor, this is a catch-22.

21:00.084 --> 21:03.827
They accuse us of overcharging,
but we can't defend ourselves

21:04.001 --> 21:05.829
because the overcharges
are covered by...

21:06.003 --> 21:07.396
Exactly, so pay up.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.268
TOOSI: Okay, wait
a minute. Okay, okay.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.140
Uh, I will hear arguments

21:12.314 --> 21:14.142
on the 22nd catch,

21:14.316 --> 21:17.450
but first... a recess?

21:17.624 --> 21:19.452
Uh, Your Honor,

21:19.626 --> 21:21.802
the defense requests
a sidebar in chambers.

21:21.976 --> 21:24.761
Okay.

21:24.935 --> 21:27.677
In your chamber.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.462
Oh, great.Yeah.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.854
I wouldn't mind getting out
of this oven.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.247
I'm burning up.

21:35.206 --> 21:39.298
Uh, Your Honor, may I point out
that Mr. Blum should not

21:39.472 --> 21:41.474
even be in here?Oh, wow.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.606
Look at these.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.304
Oh, it's taking me
back to my childhood.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.479
I loved model trains.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.697
O gauge?Of course.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.351
LIZ:
Your Honor,

21:49.525 --> 21:51.962
the expense in question is
related to narcotics charges

21:52.136 --> 21:53.877
against Mr. Cardwell
that Reddick/Boseman

21:54.051 --> 21:55.792
managed to
have dismissed.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.969
And anything related to those
narcotics charges is protected

21:59.143 --> 22:01.015
by attorney-client
privilege.Isn't she sweet?

22:01.189 --> 22:02.799
First case.Really?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.801
JULIUS:
Your Honor, the privilege
Ms. Rindell refers to

22:04.975 --> 22:07.761
is effectively waived
when Perry sued our firm.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.589
It is not waived.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.765
And if you admit this protected
material, Your Honor,

22:11.939 --> 22:13.201
you'll be putting yourself

22:13.375 --> 22:14.768
in the same position
as Robert Mueller

22:14.942 --> 22:16.465
in terms of overreach.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.206
Oh, oh, what?DIANE: This has
nothing to do with

22:18.380 --> 22:19.903
Robert Mueller...Are you trying
to intimidate the judge?

22:20.077 --> 22:21.862
Absolutely not.
No, I'm just pointing out

22:22.036 --> 22:23.298
the similarity to Mueller,
that's all.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.431
Okay, no to the
Mueller thing,

22:25.605 --> 22:29.043
and whatever you want
to bring in, you can't.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.349
So what do we think?

22:30.523 --> 22:32.046
[sighs] I think
the judge is stupid.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.657
And I think we have a more
difficult case to make.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.137
DIANE:
I think that's right.

22:36.311 --> 22:37.747
JAY:
The woman over there.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.358
The one in the brown
leather coat.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.316
MARISSA:She is threatening
Diane and Liz?

22:41.490 --> 22:43.318
Somehow I don't think I'm
getting the whole story.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.885
What do you want to do?

22:45.059 --> 22:46.060
Wait till her
friend leaves,

22:46.234 --> 22:47.235
then talk to her.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.628
MARISSA:
Good thing I have my

22:48.802 --> 22:51.152
intimidating jacket on.[chuckles]

22:51.326 --> 22:53.023
[exhales]So...

22:53.197 --> 22:55.548
we haven't really
talked for a while.Yeah.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.855
Things at work have been
a little weird. Divided.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.466
Yeah, I know.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.598
And part of it is people
aren't willing to mix.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.774
Exactly. I go off with
my friends after work

23:04.948 --> 23:06.428
to get a drink,
and the black associates

23:06.602 --> 23:07.777
go off with
their friends.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.650
What if we set out
to solve that?

23:10.824 --> 23:14.654
Have a party? Or crash
each other's gatherings?

23:14.828 --> 23:17.874
Both. Wait.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.145
Hi.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.625
Hi.

23:29.799 --> 23:32.019
We work with Diane Lockhart
and Liz Reddick.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.238
They want us to tell you
to back off.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.849
Back off what?

23:36.023 --> 23:38.025
Threats. He's
the tough one.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.853
I'm just here to
see how it's done.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.637
Well, there must be
some confusion.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.726
I have worked with Liz and
Diane, but that court case

23:43.900 --> 23:45.728
was over a month ago.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.948
And I've never threatened
anyone in my life.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.080
Then we have no need to expose
your financial issues

23:50.254 --> 23:51.473
with your polling firm.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.910
What financial issues?

23:54.084 --> 23:57.436
You overcharged on the
DL Michaels focus group by 30%.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.916
And how do we know that?My name is Marissa Gold.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.789
You've done polling
for my father.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.010
Okay.

24:07.184 --> 24:11.188
You can tell Liz and Diane
that I received their message.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.800
And that I was willing to let
our little misunderstanding

24:13.974 --> 24:16.542
drop, but they've
clearly shown

24:16.716 --> 24:19.240
that they're notwilling
to let it drop.

24:19.414 --> 24:23.723
So... tell them
I'll be seeing them.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.772
That didn't go
the way I expected.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.383
WEATHERMAN:
There are many theories
for ball lightning.

24:32.558 --> 24:35.691
Many believe that it's a
condensed form of highly excited

24:35.865 --> 24:38.259
atoms. But there are
others who believe

24:38.433 --> 24:40.000
it's an extreme
chemical reaction

24:40.174 --> 24:41.392
to pollutants in the air

24:41.567 --> 24:43.873
being trapped
by greenhouse gases.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.528
So is this related
to climate change?

24:46.702 --> 24:48.051
Well, I've asked questions...Kurt?

24:48.225 --> 24:51.054
It's the middle of the night.
What are you doing?

24:51.228 --> 24:53.535
There's a fire on the West Side.
From lightning.

24:53.709 --> 24:54.754
Oh, my God.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.539
This is about your speech.

24:57.713 --> 24:59.585
I'm almost done.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.765
No, you're not.
You only have two sentences.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.941
They thought I wasn't
honoring the occasion.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.292
Oh. Meaning they thought
you weren't fawning enough?

25:11.466 --> 25:13.120
I'm fine. Just go back to bed.

25:13.294 --> 25:15.426
Wait. Give me that.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.211
No. You hate him.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.430
Yes, but I love you.

25:19.605 --> 25:23.260
And you don't have
the fawning gene.

25:23.434 --> 25:26.655
Um...
[exhales]

25:26.829 --> 25:29.789
Just, just write this.

25:29.963 --> 25:34.533
Um... "Not since Abraham Lincoln
has our great country

25:34.707 --> 25:36.012
"been blessed by a leader

25:36.186 --> 25:40.060
of such wisdom
and courage." Hmm?

25:40.234 --> 25:43.367
Ah...[chuckles]
Oh, my God.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.761
I'm going to hell.[chuckles]

25:45.935 --> 25:50.200
Uh, "Some say that
President Trump is simple.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.639
"But there is strength
in simplicity.Mm.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.684
"Complexity has
only led us to

25:55.858 --> 25:58.426
"joblessness...

25:58.600 --> 26:01.037
and war."

26:01.211 --> 26:04.432
Uh, "When I think of the...
[grunts] immortal words

26:04.606 --> 26:06.260
of Jesus Christ..."

26:06.434 --> 26:07.914
Too much?Mm-hmm.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.264
Yeah.

26:10.438 --> 26:14.398
"When I think of the immortal
words of Margaret Thatcher..."

26:14.573 --> 26:16.966
Right? We'll find
a quote there.

26:17.140 --> 26:20.274
British, blah,
blah, blah.

26:20.448 --> 26:24.408
"I realize how blessed this
country is to find a leader

26:24.583 --> 26:27.324
for this moment in time."

26:29.413 --> 26:30.980
Huh.

26:31.154 --> 26:33.417
What?

26:33.592 --> 26:36.159
I think this
just helped me.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.292
With what?

26:38.466 --> 26:41.295
There isstrength
in simplicity.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.776
Contingency fees are
the cornerstone

26:43.950 --> 26:45.821
of our adversarial
judicial system.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.606
LIZ:
Now-now quite simply,

26:47.780 --> 26:50.086
Professor Harrison,
could you explain

26:50.260 --> 26:52.001
contingency fees
to His Honor?

26:52.175 --> 26:54.134
HARRISON:
Kahneman and Tversky's
prospect theory

26:54.308 --> 26:58.486
proposes a contrary analysis
to common economic wisdom:

26:58.660 --> 27:00.444
loss aversion...No. It's wrong.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.795
Excuse me? It is not.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.971
No, that idiot judge
will just stare at him.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.538
There is strength
in simplicity.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.149
Jay, I need you.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.759
To do what?

27:10.933 --> 27:12.761
Draw.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.721
This is Judy Giraffe.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.331
Judy defends order

27:17.505 --> 27:18.680
in the forest.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.204
It's Judy's job
to look after

27:21.378 --> 27:23.032
Paulie Possum,

27:23.206 --> 27:25.774
after he was attacked
by Benny Bobcat.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.167
But Benny worries

27:27.341 --> 27:29.473
if Judy protects allthe animals

27:29.648 --> 27:32.607
in the wild, he won't
be able to have

27:32.781 --> 27:33.826
his way with them...MAIA: Your Honor,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.218
the plaintiff
would like to,

27:35.392 --> 27:36.480
once again, register

27:36.655 --> 27:38.047
its objection
to these cartoons...

27:38.221 --> 27:41.050
So, you're saying that
Benny Bobcat is lying.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.792
MAGGIE:Contingency fees are generally
considered equitable

27:43.966 --> 27:46.577
under U.S. law because
of the inflated cost of...

27:46.752 --> 27:48.449
Wait. Wait, this will
never get through

27:48.623 --> 27:51.670
to the judge.I can't change the facts
of my testimony.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.106
We're not asking you
to change the facts,

27:53.280 --> 27:54.673
just...
the delivery.

27:54.847 --> 27:58.067
[quietly]:
I did background
on the judge.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.722
He has an ASMR fixation.You're kidding.

28:00.896 --> 28:01.941
What's that?

28:02.115 --> 28:05.640
[fingers fluttering]

28:05.814 --> 28:07.860
[whispers]: I need to...

28:08.034 --> 28:11.646
touch this microphone.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.518
[fingers brushing mic]

28:14.693 --> 28:16.346
What the hell?

28:16.520 --> 28:19.785
It-It's like a brain
orgasm for some people.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.308
It makes them
more receptive.

28:21.482 --> 28:25.616
And one of those people
is the judge.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.489
[stifled laugh]

28:28.663 --> 28:31.013
[brushing mic]

28:31.187 --> 28:34.234
Your Honor...

28:36.105 --> 28:39.456
I have to...
lean into the microphone

28:39.630 --> 28:42.764
to help you understand
about contingencies,

28:42.938 --> 28:45.724
and why Reddick/Boseman
needs to charge

28:45.898 --> 28:48.509
as much as they do.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.685
Do...

28:50.859 --> 28:53.601
do...[quietly]:
What the fuck?

28:53.775 --> 28:56.169
Your Honor, can the, uh,

28:56.343 --> 28:57.561
expert witness
speak up, please?

28:57.736 --> 28:58.867
Overruled. Sit down.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.174
Please proceed.Here's the thing

29:01.348 --> 29:03.437
about contingency charges:

29:03.611 --> 29:07.441
they are necessary
for the poorer clients

29:07.615 --> 29:10.096
[volume increases]:
to achieve justice.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.054
Justice.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.888
[cellophane crackling]

29:22.978 --> 29:25.241
They found a way
to get to the judge.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.026
We need to do the same.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.637
Okay, okay. We go back
to the old playbooks.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.683
And what's that? Bush v. Gore,2000.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.555
I was 12.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.339
Don't worry. Let me
take care of it.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.254
[chuckles]

29:42.868 --> 29:44.217
Trust me, we have never
had a president

29:44.391 --> 29:45.566
who wasn't a sociopath.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.089
Even Obama?Even him.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.048
The level of
self-centeredness it takes

29:49.222 --> 29:51.354
to think that you and only you
can change the world...

29:51.528 --> 29:52.703
Come on now.[laughter]

29:52.878 --> 29:54.662
[indistinct chatter]

29:54.836 --> 29:57.970
WOMAN:But I think you mean a
narcissist, not a sociopath.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.275
Narcissist, that's better,
that's better.Yes, that's right.

29:59.449 --> 30:00.624
You got it.[all chuckling]

30:00.799 --> 30:03.497
Hi. You mind
if I join you?

30:03.671 --> 30:05.020
Sure.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.935
You don't usually
come out.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.459
No. But you know, I had to,
uh, escape the 60-page prenup

30:09.633 --> 30:11.070
sitting on my desk.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.203
[all chuckling]What were you
talking about?

30:14.377 --> 30:16.553
Uh, whether all presidents
are sociopaths or just some.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.904
Obama thought that he deserved
to be president

30:19.078 --> 30:20.427
as a first-term senator.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.732
How is that notnarcissism?

30:21.907 --> 30:22.951
It's called being
a visionary.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.692
Hello, he was right.Trump is the

30:24.866 --> 30:26.433
most extreme of the extreme,
but the presidency

30:26.607 --> 30:28.609
requires an individual

30:28.783 --> 30:31.177
who doesn't experience emotion
the way us common folk do.Okay.

30:31.351 --> 30:33.701
Well, maybe Obama does
experience emotion differently,

30:33.875 --> 30:35.834
but you'd have to,
given all the shit he got

30:36.008 --> 30:38.053
while in office. I mean,
I bet he wished for just

30:38.227 --> 30:41.100
one day where he didn't have
to be "the blackpresident."

30:42.449 --> 30:44.190
I don't think I agree with that.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.192
I suppose I don't think
of it that way.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.629
I'm black and I never
want to be anything else.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.022
I mean, the good
outweighs the bad.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.545
Oh, yeah, sure. No.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.242
I mean, I'm not saying
that he would ever

30:53.416 --> 30:55.549
want to... be not black,

30:55.723 --> 30:57.986
just... free from

30:58.160 --> 31:00.032
the pressure... of it.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.903
Maybe.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.950
Sometimes.Hey, Lucca.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.473
Mind if I join you?

31:06.647 --> 31:08.779
I decided we all
need to mix more.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.262
So what are we talking about?

31:13.436 --> 31:16.352
What's going on?Revenge of the Empire.

31:16.526 --> 31:19.355
Who's the Empire?We are.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.270
MAN:
Listen, at least you're
not in jury duty.

31:21.444 --> 31:22.881
[all laughing]

31:23.055 --> 31:26.667
How many of you
are from out of town?

31:26.841 --> 31:30.323
Whoa! What was it, this
or a matinee of Cats?

31:30.497 --> 31:31.541
[all laughing]

31:31.715 --> 31:33.674
Calm down, sir.
Calm down.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.023
Okay, so what is this?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.634
The Brooks Brothers riot.

31:37.808 --> 31:41.160
The what?Oh, my God.

31:41.334 --> 31:44.641
Young people today and your lack
of historical appreciation.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.862
Roger Stone and I set up
the Brooks Brothers riot

31:48.036 --> 31:50.038
in Miami-Dade, back in 2000.

31:50.212 --> 31:54.695
Now, without our boys raising
hell to stop the recount,

31:54.869 --> 31:58.003
this country would've
suffered through Al Gore.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.092
Oh, I can't hear you!
Let me hear that again.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.354
[all groaning loudly]

32:01.528 --> 32:03.182
Are you kidding?

32:03.356 --> 32:06.620
Hey. It worked in 2000.Good. Now, when I want to hear

32:06.794 --> 32:08.883
mumbling, let me hear a little

32:09.057 --> 32:10.102

a number of matters.

I don't like to sit in
judgment, but I feel,

32:45.398 --> 32:48.183
that as lawyers, you know,
we have a responsibility

32:48.357 --> 32:51.882
to leave this world

on the merits.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.218
The merits?

Well, the positive merits,

not the negative ones.

Objection. Irrelevant.Your Honor,

35:27.473 --> 35:28.822
we were treated
to a distinguished

35:28.996 --> 35:31.781

lecturing us on how

35:31.955 --> 35:34.001
contingency fees
were essential.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.046
Judy Giraffe?Yes.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.397
I believe I'm entitled
to challenge that claim.

35:38.571 --> 35:39.833
Yep.

of Constance Green's son?

ADRIAN:Her son resistedarrest.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.711
MAIA:If I may,
isn't it a fact

35:48.885 --> 35:52.150
you advised Ms. Green to
accept the State of Illinois's

We may well have.

You also have
a relationship

36:01.942 --> 36:04.553
with a litigation investment

36:04.727 --> 36:07.948
We do. Or at
least, we did.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.384
MAIA:
Now, they evaluate

36:09.558 --> 36:10.907
each potential case
and they decide

36:11.081 --> 36:12.953
whether it's likely
to be profitable?

say one thing?

36:40.937 --> 36:44.071
I've had offices in storefronts

36:44.245 --> 36:46.639
and in the back row
of bond court.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.903
I've met with clients
seven nights a week

36:50.077 --> 36:51.687
in housing projects

36:51.861 --> 36:53.515
that you wouldn't walk into
without a police escort

36:53.689 --> 36:55.474
and a camera crew.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.258
I won't be held to account

36:57.432 --> 36:59.956
because the firm that I helped
to build doesn't conform

37:00.130 --> 37:04.178
to your idea of a
black law firm.

for drinks last night.

37:20.499 --> 37:21.848
Why?

37:22.022 --> 37:23.589
Because we're up
for the same partnership.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.766
Who told you?One of the partners.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.334
They're trying to pit us
against each other.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.380
Why?

37:32.554 --> 37:34.643
Because that's what people do
to the black girls.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.342
So what do we do?

37:37.516 --> 37:39.300
Well, first of all, it just
doesn't make sense that we would

37:39.474 --> 37:41.520

38:10.549 --> 38:14.248

Well, I think
we're in the end times.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.559
You think this is
the end times?

38:20.733 --> 38:23.866
I think it's the beginning
of the end times.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.520
Why?

38:25.694 --> 38:27.479
Because of that?

No, everything.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.410

Yeah.

They say it's a power plant
hit by a lightning ball.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.372
No, I think it's a conspiracy.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.418
The government is
trying a new weapon,

38:53.592 --> 38:55.420
and that's what the lightning
balls are all about.

38:55.594 --> 38:57.422
You said someone was out there?Yes.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.728
Someone without an appointment.

38:59.902 --> 39:02.296
Who?Diane Lockhart.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.212
You want me to
send her away?What? Uh-- no. No.

Please.

39:32.979 --> 39:36.939
So you, you got what you wanted.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.985
A corner office.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.640
You make it sound shameful.No.

39:41.814 --> 39:45.383
Though my guess is you wouldn't
want it to happen with Blum.

39:45.557 --> 39:48.821
Oh, he's not bad. I know
what I'm getting with him.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.171
Sometimes that's better.

39:51.345 --> 39:55.784
Maia, I have
the rare opportunity

39:55.958 --> 39:58.787
to put things right.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.702
We want you to come back.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.096

F...

40:05.664 --> 40:06.926
No.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.362
As a partner.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.673
I don't know what
your profit participation

40:14.847 --> 40:19.025
is here, but I know it can't
match what we're offering.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.896
Julius is leaving

40:21.070 --> 40:23.421
to become a judge, and that
means there's an opening

40:23.595 --> 40:24.857
for an equity partner.

40:25.031 --> 40:28.643
We want you
to fill that position.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.471
For six months,
then you'll force me out.No.

40:30.645 --> 40:31.603
We would agree

40:31.777 --> 40:33.474
to a five-year contract.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.999
In lawyer years,
that's basically an eternity.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.397
You're trying
to buy me out of my case.

40:43.571 --> 40:46.835
Yes. But this isn't charity.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.664
This is because
you impressed Boseman.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.624
This is
for the best reason.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.452
I have to think about it.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.976
Mm-hmm.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.155
Is this weird,

...that we've ended up here?

41:09.379 --> 41:11.294
Yes.

Yes.

She won't go with you.

I was impressed
by what you said in court.

43:03.406 --> 43:04.799
I was moved.

43:04.973 --> 43:07.454
That's the easy part
of battling with Blum,

43:07.628 --> 43:09.325
you always feel like you're on
the right side, no matter what.

Roland asked me
to approach Judge Toosi,

43:22.208 --> 43:25.428
on his behalf.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.865
And I did.

43:27.039 --> 43:29.998
I didn't know
the case.

43:30.172 --> 43:33.741
I didn't know
it involved you.

43:35.134 --> 43:37.440
I'm sorry.

43:37.615 --> 43:41.314
You bribed my judge?

43:50.584 --> 43:53.631
And you're not willing
to say yes

43:53.805 --> 43:56.721
because you think
I'm recording you?

43:56.895 --> 44:00.289
I'm not afraid
you're recording me.
