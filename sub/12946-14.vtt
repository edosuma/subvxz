WEBVTT

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
: Folks, we are looking

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
at some serious temperatures. How hot is it?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, let's just say it's hot.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Hotter than the barrel of Dick Cheney's gun.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
This heat is relentless. Also coming up later today--

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
MAN: Wow, you look great.
WOMAN: Thank you.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
WOMAN 2: Hey!
MAN: You really look great.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
: Nobody predicted

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
the heat wave.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
GIRL:
You want to come over

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
to my house?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
But everyone seemed to be enjoying it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
GIRL: Yeah, ask your mom.
GIRL 2: Okay.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
They say the heat makes people crazy.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
WOMAN:
Hey, Bill.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
BILL:
Hey, how are you there, Gina?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
GINA:
I love your flowers.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Come on, everybody.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Come on, everybody.
What you waitin' for?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Huh?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh,
my hair!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Riley.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
What?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
White people have pools.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Nigga, what's with the coat?

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Hey. You quit playin'
with that white man water, boy.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And you, turn off
that goddamn jungle noise.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
What?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
You heard me.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Turn off that goddamn black,
African, Congo jungle noise!

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Son of a bitch!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm gonna show
your little black ass.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
You wait until they here.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello? 911. Breaker 911.
911 emergency.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
This is Uncle Ruckus.
I'm on Timid Deer Lane.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
A little monkey's sprayin' water
all down my esophagus

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
and hittin' my nether region.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's right, officer.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
He even done sprayed me
on my brand-new shirt

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
that I finally--

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Well, if it ain't
the brave men and women

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
of the police department
come save the day.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Get out of the truck
and show me some ID!

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
ID? Oh, that's
a fine idea, officer.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Can't be too careful.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm just gonna reach
into my pocket

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
and take out my--

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Gun!

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Ah! Mr. Policeman, wait!

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Wait! It's a case
of mistaken identity!

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Hey, watch out, now!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Please, not me.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I got Indian in my family.
Seriously.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
COP:
Hold your fire!

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It's okay, officers.
It's okay.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I have a backup wallet,
just in case.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
That's where I keep
my spare Blockbuster card.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Gun!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hey, what--?
What you all doing, here?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Ow-- Oh!
Ow! Oh!

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I appreciate
what you're doing,

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
but it's the wrong fellow.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
HUEY: It was 90 degrees,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
and the temperature was rising.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Now, honey, you sure you have
enough water and a calculator?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I have everything
I need, Daddy.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh. I can't believe
what happened to Ruckus.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Morning, Huey.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
What a great day today.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Whatever.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Huey Freeman, you're
the only person I know

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
who can take a beautiful day
like this

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
and turn it into a problem.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What's that
box for?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's my soapbox.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
If you have important things
to say, you use a soapbox.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Sir, would you
like to hear

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
about how the government
wants you dead by 62,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
so you can't collect
on social security?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Is that true?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Yes, but lemon juice can lead
to a longer, healthier life.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh. I'll take a cup.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
See? You depress him,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
and I had a lemonade
ready to cheer him up.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That's called synergy.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Damn, it's hot.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
WOMAN:
The police were responding

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
to a call about
a broken fire hydrant

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
when they pulled over
the suspect

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
here on Timid Deer Lane.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
The officers
apparently mistook

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
the suspect's safety-orange
wallet for a gun

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
and shot at him 118 times,
and beat him.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What did I see?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, that brings up

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
an interesting
philosophical question.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Is it okay to snitch to
the police on the police?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Prozac can lead
to suicide.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
But lemonade
can lead to smiles,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
which can cause
dimples.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Dimples? I'll take two.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Thank you.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
You're good for business.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
WUNCLER:
What's this here?

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
"Jazmine's Lemonade Parade."

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
The E's are backwards.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Interesting.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, Jaz, look,
I'm a very powerful man

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
with a very powerful thirst.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What do you recommend?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Lemonade.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Lemonade was a popular drink
in my day,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and it still is.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
One lemonade, please.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
One dollar please,
Mr. Wuncler.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
How's business?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Not good enough.
I'm saving for a pony.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
A pony?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Wow. Those can be pricey.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Like, a couple hundred bucks.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I know.
I'm like, "Hey, guys,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I could buy a car
for that much."

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Talk about highway robbery.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Highway robbery.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
You know, I raise ponies.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
No.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Ah! Magnificent.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I admire entrepreneurship
in young people.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You mean like them
12-year-old girls

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
who work in your sweatshops
in Indonesia?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That's right.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Every morning I wake up
and put one foot on the ground

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
and the other up the ass of
a 12-year-old Indonesian girl.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And if this country didn't have
unions and child labor laws,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
maybe your generation
would understand

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
the value of hard work.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Like this little girl here.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I might have to check
with my accountants, but

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
what if I bought your stand
from you right now

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
for the price of...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
one little pony?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Wow.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
You must be rich.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Yes, I am.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm not sayin'
I do have a videotape,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
but I'm not sayin' I don't,
either.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Hypothetically speaking,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
how much would you pay
for something like that?

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, I didn't exactly see what happened, per se.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But I don't think we should jump to any conclusions.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And as the assistant district attorney,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I urge everyone to be calm.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Have you observed anyone not being calm?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
No, I guess. Ha.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
This neighborhood is actually handling the shooting

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
of an unarmed black man pretty well.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
What do you say, Jazmine?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Why not make your next move
your best move, huh?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Deal!

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
"Make your next move
your best move"?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
My lawyers will be by with
the paperwork this afternoon.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
See ya, partner.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And why in God's name
are you wearing that coat?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
It's 90 degrees.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Bye, partner.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
My own pony.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm gonna name him
"Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony."

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
What do you think?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I think he just ripped you off.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I'd expect you to say that,
pony-hater.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Daddy! Daddy! Guess what?!

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
But he never even paid
for the...lemonade.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Here's the contracts
for the lemonade stand.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
My little girl,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
already selling out
for the first time.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm so proud.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
WUNCLER:
Now, this pony,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Mr. Sammy Davis, Jr.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
will be your responsibility
from now on.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We'll keep him
at my stables

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
until you can get
your own ranch,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
which I think
will be pretty soon.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Thank you, Mr. Wuncler.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
No problem.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Now, let's think
of some ways

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
to manipulate people
emotionally,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
so that they buy lemonade.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Hm.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Those police officers
look thirsty.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
We should invite them over
for lemonade.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, guess I should let
you partners get to work.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Oh, hey there,
Huey.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh. That is so
not appropriate, Huey.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So when do I get to see
Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
When you learn how to run
a respectable business.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Huh?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
What the hell is up
with this sign?

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
What's this crude drawing
supposed to be?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I-it's the m-m-magical
pony carriage.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
This looks like
a kid drew it.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
WUNCLER:
Look at this.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Why are all the E's backwards?

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
I-- I-- It's supposed
to be c-cute.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
You think ignorance is cute?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, I suppose you think
mental retardation

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
is downright adorable.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Lemonade, now.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
WUNCLER:
How is anyone

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
supposed to believe
you can make lemonade

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
when you can't
even spell it?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
How old are you?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
T-t-t-ten.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
T-t-t-too damn old to be writing
your E's backwards, damn it.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
WUNCLER:
Squirm, little worm.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
What happened?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It's okay,
Jazmine.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
You don't need him.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
What do you mean,
I don't need him?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, you're not gonna let him
treat you like that.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
What, you think ponies
grow on trees?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
What kind of question is that?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's a large,
four-legged mammal.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Or maybe I'm just supposed
to wait

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
until I'm an old woman
before I get my pony.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
How am I gonna
look, Huey?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
A 65-year-old woman
riding a pony.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Jazmine, he's a crook.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You just want everyone
to be miserable

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
because you're miserable.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And why are you wearing
that stupid coat?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I wish you'd go away.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
HUEY: They say the heat

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
makes people crazy.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, buck up, son.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm sure you'll
get me next time.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Weatherman says it's gonna be hotter tomorrow.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Pshh. I hope not.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
: Folks, this heat

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
will not let up.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It is hot.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
And speaking of hot, Al Sharpton is hot right now,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
having a big old protest.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Seems like Al's angry again at something.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I believe it's a cartoon this time.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
In fact, he wants to have all...

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I want these tables cleaned
every hour on the hour.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Now, where's
my money?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, don't stand there.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Lemonade ain't gonna
make itself.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
If I see a single thirsty person
on this block,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
they'd better be broke.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It's gonna be hot today.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
HUEY: A press conference was held

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
at Jazmine's lemonade stand

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
to announce Ruckus' settle with the police department.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
He turned down a seven-figure settlement offer.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
In fact, all Ruckus asked for

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
was to fulfill a childhood dream

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
of being a police officer.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So help me God.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Congratulations,
Officer Uncle Ruckus.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
RUCKUS:
Thank you, thank you.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Thank you.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
You know--

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
--people been asking me

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
if I'm upset
about what happened yesterday.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I say, no.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Ruckus is not upset.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Because the swift and measured
response of these officers

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
is a fine example of
my tax dollars hard at work.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
And I just want you
all to know

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
that I hope to live up to
the fine example of those men.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And I hope to harass and beat

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
each and every
black person I see

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
with "excreme" prejudice.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
GIRL:
That's a totally great idea.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
That's great.
Yeah.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm glad you feel me
on that sentiment.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Now, let's enjoy
some delicious lemonade

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
from this little
mix-breed girl.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
That's an order
from Officer Ruckus.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, my rear.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
That's right, Bob.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I'm standing on
Timid Deer Lane in Woodcrest,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
where one little girl
has turned the lemon

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
of shocking police brutality
into lemonade.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Woodcrest isn't a place where people dwell on the past

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
and focus on the negative, like who shot at who 118 times,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
or who cracked whose ribcage.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That's all media hype.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
In my day,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
we resolved our differences the old-fashioned way:

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
over a cool glass of lemonade.
WOMAN:  Ow, my toe.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
We just want everyone to know

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
that this was not racially motivated.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And everyone is welcome to come to Woodcrest.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Uh, including the African-Americans.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Just don't stay too long, darkies.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Just kiddin'. Not really.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
MAN: Come on, damn it.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
MAN 2:
And you told me to come here,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and now I'm not gonna listen.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
MAN 3: Whatever.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Let's see.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I want a...

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I'll take two small lemonades
with ice,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
two small lemonades
without ice,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
three large lemonades,
one with ice,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
one with no ice,
one with crushed ice.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Do you guys have,
uh...mm-mmm...?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Uh...

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
That's all I got.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Lemonade is a dollar.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That's all I got!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Make it work.
I'm thirsty.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Lemonade is a dollar.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I ain't got no dollar.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
It's hot as hell out here, man.
Just hook me up.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
All the money
I spent up in this place,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
this is some ol' bullshit!

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Lemonade is a dollar!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Mm...

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Uh, do you guys have anything
other than lemonade?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Jazmine, this is stupid.
You're being exploited.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
You'll never get anywhere
in this world

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
without doing a fair day's work

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
for a fair day's pay.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Jazmine, Ed's never
gonna give you that pony.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Next.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Peaches, I think it's time
you come inside.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Can't talk, Dad.
Making lemonade.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Come on, honey,
I want you inside  now.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
No!
I have been

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
waiting 20 minutes

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
for this lemonade.
I'm thirsty!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
What's the problem?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Mr. Wuncler,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
you know, yesterday
I thought this was cute.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
But don't you think you guys
are taking this a little far?

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Jazmine can leave
whenever she wants.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
But Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony
will have to be put down.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
What?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
He's your pony now.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Your percentage was supposed to
pay for his food and upkeep.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Now he'll starve to death
in a puddle of his own feces.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Oh, come on,
Mr. Wuncler.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't want to leave,
Mr. Wuncler.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Please, Daddy,
don't make me leave.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
There you have it.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You know the name of the game.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Your daughter chose me.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Now, we can handle this
like some gentlemen,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
or we can get into
some old gangster shit.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Mm...

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Okay, best of luck,
honey.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
: This heat will not stop.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
This portion of the program sponsored by

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Jazmine's Lemonade Parade,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
a subsidiary of Wuncler Food Incorporated.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Oh, Wuncler. That's...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Thank you.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Come again, ma'am.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
MAN:
I have to have a glass.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Hello. Bye.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
WOMAN:
Come on, move it.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
My legs are sore.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
WOMAN 2:
Oh! Come on.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
MAN:
Hey, kid!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Huh?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Wake up!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Some of us have to work
for a living.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
CROWD: Yeah.
MAN: She's taking too long.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
:
Oh, not another day.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
MAN: No more child labor!
MAN 2: That's right!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
MAN 3: Hell no, we won't go!
WOMAN: Let's go!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Hell no, we won't go!

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
We're gonna shut down
this lemonade stand

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
and liberate that little girl.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah!
Right on, man!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Stop in the name of the law.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Just what the hell y'all
think y'all doing, here?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah,
quit making trouble.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
We're thirsty.
Get lost.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Let's get 'em!

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
WOMAN:
Release the children!

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Let 'em run free, man.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
What the hell are you doing?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
We're protesting.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Quit playing.
Let's shut it down.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
This will shut it down.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
WOMAN 2: Yeah.
Just very slowly...

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
WOMAN 2: Children!
...and peacefully.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
We're gonna liberate that
girl one of these days.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Even if it's not
in our lifetimes, right?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Who's with me?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Why don't you
leave me alone?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't want
your help.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Jazmine,
there is no pony.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
There is too.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
He has a white tail.
I saw the picture.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
MAN: Look.
MAN 2: Hey, get some deodorant.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Ponies!

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Ponies!

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, my gosh,
look at the mane!

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Oh, my gosh!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
it has been brought
to my attention

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
that Jazmine's Lemonade Parade
has been using child labor.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Obviously, this comes
as a great surprise to me.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
So I present to you...

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Wuncler's Cruelty-Free Lemonade.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
It's lemonade, but without
the biting sting of injustice.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Its lack of cruelty
makes it look delicious.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
And I know it's cruelty-free,
because he said so.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And it's on the label.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Sammy, I'm coming!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Ow! Please, let me through.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Ow!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Ugh! Please move.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Ow!

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Mr. Wuncler.
Let me see my pony.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Your pony?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
You better check the contract,
young lady.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
HUEY: Wuncler's deal with Jazmine

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
advanced her one $213 pony

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
against a five-point royalty,

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
which gave her 5 cents of every cup sold.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
That meant Jazmine had to sell 4260 cups of lemonade

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
before the pony was actually hers.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
She in fact sold 4376 cups.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
But what Jazmine hadn't calculated

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
was the cost of her new stand,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
marketing and promotion,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
the lemons, cups, umbrellas, straws,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
and the gas to drive Wuncler back and forth from the stand,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
all came out of her 5 percent.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Jazmine not only didn't get her pony,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
she ended up about $300 in debt to Ed Wuncler.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
You know, Miss DuBois,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I sunk a lot of money
into this business.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I gave you an opportunity.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
But that's just not
good enough for you, is it?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You wanted a handout.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I just want my pony.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I've never seen anyone
so ungrateful.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
This partnership is over.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony
belongs to me now.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
No!

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Don't take Sammy.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm sorry.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I won't be ungrateful.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Hey, cry about your failed
dreams on your own time.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
We want lemonade.
What's taking so long?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Hey, give us some of
that cruelty-free stuff.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Hey, man, fuck y'all.
Get your own.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
MALCOLM X: Today is time to stop singing

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
and stop swinging.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
HUEY: Maybe the heat does

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
make people crazy.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
HUEY: Before you know it,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
crazy becomes normal.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Huh! Ha! Huh!

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Get your black ass out of here.
Get out of here right now.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
What's wrong?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Huh?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Gun!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Huh?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Ow! Ow-- Easy. Excellent use
of a baton, officer.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
HUEY: But sanity eventually returned.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And when it does, you better have your coat.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
MAN:
Come here.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
WOMAN:
I'm so sorry.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
MAN 2:
That was bad.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
WOMAN:
No, I was really to blame.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
MAN 2:
Here's your guitar.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
If you really
think about it--

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
WOMAN 2:
This is so stupid.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Over lemonade.
I mean, that's so dumb.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
MAN 3:
No, it was my fault.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
RUCKUS:
Uh, help me up.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
WOMAN 2:
That'd be great. Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I s-s-shouldn't have taken
that n-nap.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Have I ever told you about

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
J-J-Jazmine's Hot Chocolate
Explosion?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
It would be a delivery service
for hot chocolate.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I can charge a delivery fee
and get tips.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
RUCKUS:
Move along. Move along,

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
There's nothing to see here.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
RUCKUS:
Oh, a unicorn.
