01:20.360 --> 01:25.220
There were three little pigs
and they made a house out of twigs

01:25.320 --> 01:27.129
and the wolf came...

01:31.720 --> 01:32.980
He blows it down?

01:33.080 --> 01:34.820
Yeah, but what happens in the middle?

01:34.920 --> 01:37.082
I keep wanting to do
this little piggy went to market,

01:37.200 --> 01:38.326
but that's with the toes.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.140
And the wolf keeps blowing the house in.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.740
And the pigs keep making
different houses.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.366
And... No, no. No, no, no, no.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.486
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.140
Okay, who's ready to eat?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.322
Who's ready to eat?

02:03.560 --> 02:06.740
I love how she stretches,
it's just like we do.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.100
It's so funny.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.100
It never occurred to me
that stretching is innate.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.282
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.166
Okay, it got infected with staph,
but it's not the bad staph.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.260
- What is it?
- Guess.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.180
You can come closer, it's not bad staph.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.740
I still don't want the baby touching it.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.330
I can't tell.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.380
It's Willow's sonogram.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.060
Yeah.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.540
I did it for Marina.
I was just so fucking proud of her.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.060
Why it's for me,
I still don't understand.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.730
You know, she didn't even
get the epidural.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.100
It's a mother fucker.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.770
It's a ring of fucking fire,

02:39.040 --> 02:41.660
but it was the most beautiful
experience of my life.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.489
I fell in love immediately.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.860
A love I've never felt.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.180
Don't take that the wrong way, Marina.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.965
No, I know exactly what you mean.
It's pure.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.330
- You guys should do it!
- Yeah.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.820
You would make such good parents.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.420
- I'm sorry. I know you...
- No, no, it's fine.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.980
We, you know, we...

02:56.080 --> 02:57.650
It's just such a game changer.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.180
When I saw her, I thought, "I know you."

03:00.280 --> 03:03.045
- It's true, I recognized her immediately.
- Because I'd read to her in the womb,

03:03.160 --> 03:05.780
she knew my voice immediately.
I read Stephen King's The Tommyknockers.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.220
It's like in one moment,
everything is different.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.322
- It's like all the stuff before...
- It's a gift.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.620
- Fine, you know, we're figuring it out.
- I mean, we're just animals.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.611
But now, okay, real life. You know?

03:18.520 --> 03:20.860
I can't remember
Goldilocks either anymore.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.860
The porridge part, but not what happens.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.300
- She gets eaten, right?
- Does she?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.482
There's, like, an oven that's too hot.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.045
You don't want kids, right?

03:30.480 --> 03:31.900
Because I don't.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.580
I'm sorry, I feel so guilty
for saying that.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.700
I mean, I did.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.460
If we'd had the magic sexy version

03:37.560 --> 03:39.540
and one day suddenly had a baby.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.042
But all those drugs
and shots and miscarriages.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.100
I don't want to do it again
and it not to work.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.340
I know. And I like our life as it is.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.020
Yeah. I mean, if we wanted to take off
to Paris tomorrow, we could.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.900
Yeah, I mean,
I think we might have a hard time

03:53.000 --> 03:55.620
finding an affordable fare
on such short notice, but yeah.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.180
No, I know, and I couldn't leave work.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.851
If we're going to do it, we should plan it
at least a month in advance.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.380
A month is still in the realm
of spontaneity.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.420
No, I know.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.260
I mean, the time we spent in Rome,
what was that?

04:06.360 --> 04:07.620
2006.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.165
- It wasn't 2006.
- Yeah, it was.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.220
Because I was working
with my dad on his dance film.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.322
Rome was eight years ago already?

04:14.920 --> 04:16.365
- Shit.
- Yeah.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.660
I looked at the pictures recently.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.922
We were two younger people
standing at the Trevi Fountain.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.721
- We look similar.
- We look younger.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.810
I tried to get you to go
to Mexico last summer.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.740
I needed to finish my documentary.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.569
But you didn't finish it.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.850
Well, maybe the point is
we have the freedom.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.207
What we do with it isn't that important.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.523
Marina said they haven't
had sex in nearly a year.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.540
Fletcher was too weirded out
by the pregnancy.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.165
God.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.046
Delivery?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.042
What is that, a 75-watt?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.881
I can't see, it's too bright.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.085
It's too high a wattage.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.500
I'll change it tomorrow.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.020
There was a poll conducted in 1987

05:17.120 --> 05:19.900
in which people were given
a series of phrases

05:20.000 --> 05:23.482
And asked which ones
could be found in the U.S. Constitution.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.846
One of the phrases that got
the highest percentage of votes was,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.740
"From each according to his ability,

05:30.840 --> 05:32.860
"to each according to his need."

05:32.960 --> 05:34.610
Let me see the continuities.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.860
...in the U.S. Constitution,
but is the famous communist credo

05:38.960 --> 05:40.500
popularized by Karl Mam.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.204
Why do they type this stuff so small?

05:42.320 --> 05:44.971
I think that's 12 point. That's normal.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.051
- It's not 12, it's at most eight.
- Excuse me.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.260
- Hello?
- We have to cut away from Ira here

05:51.360 --> 05:55.100
- because he gets a phone call.
- Sweetie, this happens every fucking day.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.771
Okay, cut me to me
asking the question about hermeneutics.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.287
We could, but...

06:00.160 --> 06:01.860
You look like this.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.900
Why is Paul Ricoeur's idea of the
hermeneutics of suspicion so important?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.968
It's from eight years ago.

06:07.720 --> 06:13.260
And the previous shot of you asking
any relevant questions is this.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.860
So, then, what did Mills mean
by the concept of military...

06:15.960 --> 06:17.371
God, that was eight years ago?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.450
It's been 10.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.962
Are my eyes getting hollows?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.325
I don't know.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.489
Well, we're getting there.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.980
When I get the rest of the grant money,
we'll reshoot me asking the questions

06:31.080 --> 06:33.300
along with the trip to Istanbul.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.060
Look, Josh, I hate to bring this up,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.925
but I'm gonna need a little money soon.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.420
No, I know, you've been patient.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.260
I'm just waiting
for the rest of the last grant money.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.362
But soon?

06:48.160 --> 06:49.571
Yeah, I'll get you.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.700
"Documentary is about someone else.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.689
"Fiction is about me."

06:56.520 --> 06:58.568
This is a quote from Jean-Luc Godard.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.460
Now, what do we think about this?

07:01.560 --> 07:04.166
Can a documentary be personal?

07:05.360 --> 07:08.300
Documentaries,
I want to say to you today,

07:08.400 --> 07:10.562
can and should be about me.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.247
"Me" meaning all of us.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.081
Lights.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.406
Frank, could you just hit that switch?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.680
Now, this is an image from...

07:25.680 --> 07:27.205
Shit.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.088
This should be an image
of seal hunting from Nanook of the North.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.441
Sorry.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.442
- About what?
- Hey. Beautiful class.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.209
Thanks. I don't know
why the PowerPoint didn't work, but...

07:46.680 --> 07:48.820
I loved what you said
about hyper reality.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.844
- Thanks.
- I'm Jamie. This is my wife, Darby.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.940
Josh Srebnick.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.460
Nice to meet you.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.164
- It was interesting.
- Thanks.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.006
I'm not sure
why the PowerPoint didn't work.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.020
How did you get in here?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.940
Well, we're auditing your class.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.900
It's a continuing education class,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.606
you can't audit
a continuing education class.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.460
I'm a fan.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.962
And, hey,
I really loved your film Power Elite.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.401
You've seen it?

08:16.640 --> 08:17.820
Hey, thanks.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.500
It's everything I aspire to,
and you make it look so easy.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.700
Do you make documentaries?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.220
I shoot stuff, you know,
with friends, yeah.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.321
But nothing like what you're doing.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.540
He's always shooting.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.060
Don't take this the wrong way,

08:29.160 --> 08:30.740
but how did you see Power Elite?

08:30.840 --> 08:32.171
I found a VHS on eBay.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.460
I paid, like, 60 bucks for it.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.500
You know what was great, was that scene
with the dogs around the garbage.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.647
How did you stage that?

08:39.679 --> 08:43.605
Those dogs were just there
and I said, "Hey, shoot those dogs."

08:44.760 --> 08:45.807
And we did.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.041
Beautiful.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.580
I've been working on this other one
for about eight years now,

08:51.680 --> 08:54.020
but I think I'm zeroing in on it.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.180
I'd love to see it.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.420
You want to come get a bite with us?

08:56.520 --> 09:00.060
I'm meeting my wife
around the corner at this Chinese place.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.640
My wife and I are going
to the same goddamn place!

09:04.400 --> 09:07.580
I've learned along the way you can discover
more by not knowing all the answers,

09:07.680 --> 09:09.808
by allowing yourself
to be surprised by what you encounter.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.060
- Yeah, yeah.
- And sometimes that means waiting

09:12.160 --> 09:14.220
years for something to happen.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.500
How did you start out?
Like, who influenced you?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.540
Well, I steal from everyone.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.420
Wiseman, Maysles, Pennebaker.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.251
My first job out of graduate school
was working for Leslie Breitbart.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.020
Jeez Louise.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.300
That's also, incidentally,
how I met Cornelia.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.180
- He's her dad.
- What?

09:30.280 --> 09:32.260
This is before they hated each other.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.580
We don't hate each other.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.570
- Cornelia also produces her dad's films.
- He's amazing.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.220
He's a giant.
He's a guy I'd love to meet.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.209
Do you also produce Josh's films?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.810
No, Josh likes to work alone.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.820
Josh, what's your new film about?

09:44.920 --> 09:46.580
Well, I'm trying to solve the problem

09:46.680 --> 09:48.740
that Eisenstein never solved,

09:48.840 --> 09:51.060
that is, how to make a film
that is both materialist

09:51.160 --> 09:53.128
and intellectual at the same time.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.020
It's about the distinctly
American relationship

09:56.120 --> 09:58.009
between biography and history,

09:58.360 --> 09:59.500
theory and method

09:59.600 --> 10:02.900
and how that relates
to power and class in our country,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.480
particularly the political,
military and economic elite.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.100
- It's really about America.
- Eisenstein's astonishing.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.440
I just watched Strike.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.660
I'm obsessed with Europe
in the '20s, see.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.780
The interwar period,
ex-patriots, that sort of thing.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.420
I keep trying to get Jamie
to do something with before-and-afters.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.249
All humans love before-and-afters.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.340
Any TV show
with before-and-afters will succeed.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.046
Before you said that.
After you said that.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.285
Fuck you.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.500
What do you do, Darby?

10:32.600 --> 10:35.285
- Darby makes ice cream.
- Yeah, I make ice cream.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.540
I brought some of it to
the Whole Foods near us. They're pumped.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.860
It's Jamie's idea to sell it,

10:39.960 --> 10:41.220
I just do it because I like it.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.780
And you guys are married?

10:42.880 --> 10:44.962
That's so nice and old-fashioned.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.300
Yeah. We said our vows
in an empty water tower in Harlem.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.880
There was a mariachi band
and a Slip'N Slide.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.460
It was beautiful.
Some rituals exist for a reason.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.766
Jamie wanted a big wedding.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.724
We did it at City Hall.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.460
Isaac and Benny are walking the tracks.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.140
Have you done this?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.420
We walked through the subway tunnels
of the D line last week.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.700
- No, no, we haven't.
- They're at a bar on Essex.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.450
Do you want to come?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.326
Do we?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.721
It's already past our bedtime.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.606
Yeah, we're usually in bed by 11:00.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.046
- Let me get it.
- Thanks.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.527
Yeah, thanks.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.849
No, yeah, I'll get it.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.380
If you've got any time,
and I know you're super busy,

11:27.480 --> 11:29.180
I'd love to show you
what I'm working on.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.740
Come by our place this weekend.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.260
I have my fall flavors.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.980
They don't make this film anymore.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.731
I bought 400 packs
before they discontinued it.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.161
Let's go, worm!

11:41.160 --> 11:43.083
Jamie is always moving.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.529
I can't leap as fast as that kid.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.971
I don't move as quickly.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.605
You should see him on Rollerblades.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.020
I like how engaged
they are in everything.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.620
They're all making things
and they're so excited for each other.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.165
It's selfless.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.740
And they're so respectful of us.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.580
I mean, compared to
when we go out with Marina and Fletcher,

12:05.680 --> 12:08.220
I feel like we're all just
talking about ourselves.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.420
They asked questions.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.140
They didn't ask me any questions.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.540
When I was their age, I never would have

12:12.640 --> 12:14.100
come up to me like that
and invited me out.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.700
I would have been too scared.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.325
They're really not nervous.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.900
I just wish
you hadn't told him I work with my dad.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.020
Why?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.500
I don't know, he seems ambitious.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.620
No. I don't think he thinks that way.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.020
It's about process.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.900
How has he even seen anything of yours?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.180
EBay.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.660
I love his shoes.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.580
I have some wing tips here somewhere.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.444
I stopped wearing them
when I got shin splints.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.020
It was almost like he was studying you.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.420
Can we go to their place this weekend?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.420
We never see our real friends.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.580
Why do you suddenly want to hang out
with a couple of 25-year-olds?

12:46.680 --> 12:47.820
We were just 25.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.580
I mean, we weren't, but you know.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.966
It'll be fun.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.740
It would probably be Richard Dreyfuss.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.683
He's friends with my parents.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.446
A member of Parliament.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.241
Probably Shia LaBeouf.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.700
This girl who wrote
on that show, Medium.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.723
- Doug Liman.
- Bill Clinton.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.780
But I think it's probably his office.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.325
It's ringing.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.580
Yeah, it's his office.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.364
Robert Downey Sr.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.580
It's really funny.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.300
- I like Robert Downey Sr.
- That's the latest anyway.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.500
I'm also doing people describing scenes
from movies that they like

13:23.600 --> 13:24.940
but haven't seen in a while.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.340
Darby's going to do
Rosemary's Baby, see.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.442
"What have you done to its eyes?"

13:29.720 --> 13:31.449
"He has his father's eyes."

13:32.080 --> 13:34.460
Joshy, come with me to the playroom.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.643
- I want a kitten!
- That's Good Cop. This is Bad Cop.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.420
I love these kittens.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.569
I hope they don't grow up to be assholes,
because that can happen.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.931
Oh, my God.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.281
This is just like my record collection.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.740
Except mine are CDs.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.340
CDs?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.920
It took me years to discover this stuff.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.246
I need to buy a new desk.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.660
You should come with me
to the lumber yard.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.380
We'll make one.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.780
A whole desk?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.609
It's much cheaper than buying one, see.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.660
And more fun.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.047
Darby, can I borrow your bike?

14:11.160 --> 14:13.380
I'm going to the deli for some Goldfish.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.540
Okay.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.688
Tipper, did you feed Nico?

14:17.480 --> 14:18.766
I forgot.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.685
That's our roommate, Tipper.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.940
Ding-a-ling-a-ling! Chow time!

14:27.040 --> 14:28.565
Nico's a chicken?

14:31.040 --> 14:34.580
I have to say I really admire
how you guys are so in the moment

14:34.680 --> 14:37.700
and just enjoying doing
and making things.

14:37.800 --> 14:38.847
It's inspiring.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.020
Thanks, Joshy.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.340
People our age are so success
and results-oriented,

14:43.440 --> 14:45.329
they've forgotten about process.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.540
Josh, are you success-oriented?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.130
- No.
- Totally.

14:52.160 --> 14:56.060
I feel like there are people
who don't drop things as much as I do.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.491
I don't keep things yar.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.340
She's a mess. And an ugly eater.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.460
I say that with love.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.580
Fuck you.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.820
It's an avocado and almond milk sorbet.
Benny designed the container.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.220
It tastes like that candy that they
sometimes make into pigs or little fruits.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.290
Yeah, it's... Shit. I know that.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.243
I keep wanting to say baklava,
but that's a Greek dessert.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.365
The almond-tasting pigs and fruits
are made of...

15:22.040 --> 15:23.020
I'll look it up.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.202
- No, that's too easy.
- Let's try to remember it.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.445
- Can I now?
- No.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.727
Let's just not know what it is.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.170
Over here. Let's go!

16:43.920 --> 16:45.160
End transmission.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.367
We have news.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.700
I decided, with Marina
going back to work,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.820
I'm going to take
a leave of absence from the firm

16:51.920 --> 16:52.967
and take care of Willow.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.285
Cool. How long?

16:56.600 --> 16:57.580
Indefinite.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.001
It's such a load off
and I'm making enough, so...

17:00.120 --> 17:02.180
Hey, it's really just my ego at stake.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.180
- Time to re-watch Mr. Mom.
- I already Netflixed it.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.339
I got some laughs.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.805
We're the boring couple with a baby.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.260
What have you guys been doing?
Tell us something fun.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.300
We met this interesting couple.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.640
Jamie and Darby.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.604
He's a young documentarian
and she makes ice cream.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.020
I don't know what
to make of them, honestly.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.859
- I like her.
- They make everything.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.180
It's infectious.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.407
For about 12 hours,
I thought I could build my own desk.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.180
There is something
about being around them

17:26.280 --> 17:27.900
that energizes you, you know?

17:28.000 --> 17:28.980
How old are they?

17:29.080 --> 17:31.340
- Twenty-six, 27.
- Twenty-five, 26.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.500
They're children!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.020
Yeah, nine years ago,
they couldn't vote.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.460
- But they're married.
- Why?

17:35.560 --> 17:37.460
You should see
this guy's record collection.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.380
It's Jay-Z, it's Thin Lizzy,
it's Mozart.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.970
His taste is democratic.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.700
It's The Goonies and it's Citizen Kane.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.220
They don't distinguish
between high and low, it's wonderful.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.540
When did The Goonies
become a good movie?

17:47.640 --> 17:48.700
Well, you should hear this guy
talk about it.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.300
And it's like their apartment
is full of everything we once threw out,

17:51.400 --> 17:53.260
but it looks so good
the way they have it.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.124
Who directed The Goonies?
I'll look it up.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.900
Why is it that when one person picks up
their phone, everybody else has to?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.180
- I have a quick thing.
- I'm not on my phone.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.260
- The baby.
- Richard Donner.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.330
Each of us is so certain that we've got
the most important thing to do right now.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.660
I know, it's so rude.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.900
Not anymore.
It used to be, but now it's accepted.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.287
It's like showing your ankles
in the 1800s.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.201
The almond-tasting pigs
and fruits are made of...

18:17.600 --> 18:19.011
- Marzipan!
- Marzipan!

18:22.200 --> 18:23.700
I thought...

18:23.800 --> 18:25.740
You guys want to hit
this street beach with us?

18:25.840 --> 18:27.020
I don't know what you're saying.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.300
It's something
Jamie and Darby are doing.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.140
Since when do you guys
do two things in one night?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.180
- You never go anywhere.
- We go anywhere.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.780
We have to get back for the sitter.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.340
Scratch that, we want to get back.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.860
I hate being away from her.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.180
- The sitter?
- Yeah. It's true.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.780
We've lost you to the baby.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.300
You guys have to come see her again.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.900
- You should, really. We're always home.
- She's already a different person.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.500
- Anytime, come by. We're always home.
- Okay. Yeah.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.100
- All right, okay.
- See ya.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.043
We have lost them to the baby.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.100
We go anywhere, right?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.043
We never go anywhere.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.884
High kick contest!

19:18.160 --> 19:20.242
- What's the rumpus, Srebnicks?
- You came!

19:21.880 --> 19:22.940
Have you tried this?

19:23.040 --> 19:24.380
Someone at some college figured out

19:24.480 --> 19:28.690
that if you put Jolly Ranchers in vodka
for 24 hours, it's awesome.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.420
- Can I run an idea by you?
- Sure, what?

19:31.520 --> 19:32.980
It's a project I want to shoot.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.081
Okay.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.820
I've never done Facebook,
it's not my thing, see.

19:36.920 --> 19:37.900
Really?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.500
Yeah, I was against it at first,
but it's actually quite a useful tool.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.001
I mean, it makes me feel
like I'm really connected.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.060
And there's pictures... What the shit?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.420
- Watch it!
- I love you!

19:48.520 --> 19:50.500
- All right.
- It's lame, yeah.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.807
That's why I'm doing
this new thing with it.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.580
I'm going to start a profile
and wait for people to contact me.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.728
Well, that part's normal,
that's Facebook.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.900
And whoever the first person
is from my childhood,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.460
someone I'm no longer in touch with,

20:01.560 --> 20:05.140
who contacts me, instead of responding
to them on Facebook, see,

20:05.240 --> 20:08.060
I'm going to go find them in person.
With my camera.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.140
Okay.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.540
Like, make Facebook real.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.324
It's like, you want to talk to me?
Let's talk.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.060
Kind of just like real life?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.650
Exactly.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.486
- Well, real was there before Facebook.
- Right.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.580
Sounds interesting.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.681
I'm not sure it's enough.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.220
- What do you mean?
- Well, think about what you want to say.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.580
I mean, what are you hoping to find?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.180
Well, I'll know when I get there.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.203
You said we should be open
to surprises, right?

20:30.640 --> 20:31.660
It's a nice beginning.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.380
But it might not be
a full enough meal yet, you know?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.606
Keep digging.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.340
When I criticize quantitative analysis,

20:39.440 --> 20:42.500
it's not because statistics
don't tell us anything.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.729
On the contrary,
I'd say they are often very revealing.

20:45.840 --> 20:49.003
In fact,
they can often be most revealing when...

20:50.120 --> 20:51.500
I've got to go to the gents'.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.250
Wait, the mic.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.211
Thank you.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.370
- I guess he's just doing that.
- Yeah.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.700
Hey, Josh, how's that grant money doing?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.620
I'm expecting an email
any day now confirming...

21:10.720 --> 21:13.420
No, thanks, but the rest
of the grant money is coming?

21:13.520 --> 21:14.580
Yes.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.620
Assuming they get funded
for the next calendar year.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.300
- Did you feed the dog?
- I'm about to, sweetie.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.380
What does that mean?

21:19.480 --> 21:22.260
I don't know,
one of the donors left his wife and...

21:22.360 --> 21:24.180
I don't know.
But they're confirming the funding.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.248
Why'd he leave his wife?

21:29.320 --> 21:30.810
I don't know.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.620
Hey, Fox!

21:39.720 --> 21:41.420
Hey, Foxy Fox!

21:41.520 --> 21:43.860
I was just going to call you
to see if you wanted to get lunch.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.121
How sweet.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.140
This is Pepper and Elise.
This is Cornelia.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.300
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.420
We're going to a music class.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.820
It's really just for the mothers,
they don't do anything yet.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.780
- Do you want to come?
- Maybe.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.540
Come on, then!

21:56.640 --> 21:57.900
How old are your kids?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.140
Mine? I... I don't have any kids.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.084
You're gonna...
You're just coming to hang out.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.860
Cool.

22:04.960 --> 22:05.940
It's adorable.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.060
If you didn't know better,
you'd think they're having seizures.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.400
Oh, yeah.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.327
Hello, hello. Let's get
our hello hands high in the sky.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.940
And let's wave hello
to each and every one of our friends

22:16.040 --> 22:17.980
- on this train with us today.
- Hi!

22:18.080 --> 22:21.607
That's right.
It's time to get this party started.

22:23.200 --> 22:28.525
All aboard
Pick your destination

22:28.760 --> 22:33.220
All aboard
Come on, here we go

22:33.320 --> 22:35.368
Now everybody say, choo-choo!

22:35.760 --> 22:37.100
- Choo-choo.
- That's right.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.441
- Choo-choo.
- Together. Choo-choo.

22:40.520 --> 22:45.686
All aboard
Here at the station

22:45.800 --> 22:51.091
All aboard
We want to say hello

22:51.480 --> 22:57.044
All aboard
Pick your destination

22:57.480 --> 22:59.660
All aboard

22:59.760 --> 23:00.900
Holy shit!

23:01.000 --> 23:02.020
Come on, here we go

23:02.120 --> 23:04.620
Now everybody say choo-choo!

23:04.720 --> 23:07.420
- Choo-choo!
- Say choo-choo!

23:07.520 --> 23:09.500
I mean, I love her, she's a great mom,

23:09.600 --> 23:11.540
but I always felt like if I had a baby,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.700
the baby would just fold into my life.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.620
I mean, if you spend all your time
at baby classes, you become a baby.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.660
It's like the mothers are infantilized,
you know?

23:19.760 --> 23:21.171
I know, just, like, have a baby.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.203
You're cool, you know,
cool people who have a house

23:23.320 --> 23:25.620
and, I don't know, just have a baby.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.060
You're going to Mexican food
and there's a baby on the floor.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.940
I know. That's how I grew up.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.060
I want a baby.
Maybe I'll just have a baby right now.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.260
You should. You can.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.620
I like kids who don't speak English.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.500
When are you going to have babies?

23:38.600 --> 23:41.660
A couple of times I got pregnant,
but it didn't happen.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.330
I'm sorry.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.060
The longest only went eight weeks.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.300
After 35, it's a shit show.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.620
I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.300
No, it's okay. It's what happened.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.420
I like telling you.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.940
I like how you give Josh a hard time.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.660
I don't think I give him a hard time.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.380
It reminds me of my mom.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.180
How she was with your dad?

23:59.280 --> 24:00.420
No, with my brother.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.900
God, she'd yell at him, but then iron
all his weird racing T-shirts.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.525
I mother Jamie.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.380
Sorry, I stink.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.540
- It's okay.
- Here we go, here we go.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.325
- What kind of class is this again?
- Hip-hop.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.250
I like that one.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.924
No, it's between these and these.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.005
Hey, Jamie!

25:40.520 --> 25:41.726
Jamie!

25:44.000 --> 25:46.100
Well, it's just a strained muscle.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.965
But the more concerning
thing here is your arthritis.

25:49.800 --> 25:50.740
Arthritis?

25:50.840 --> 25:53.207
Yes. You have arthritis in your knee.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.220
Is arthritis a catch-all

25:57.320 --> 25:59.540
for some kind of injury to the...

25:59.640 --> 26:02.540
No, arthritis is a degradation
of the joints.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.540
Yeah, I know
what traditional arthritis is.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.580
But...

26:05.680 --> 26:09.446
I'm not sure what you mean
by "traditional," but this is arthritis.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.764
Arthritis arthritis?

26:11.880 --> 26:14.740
Yes. I usually just say it once.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.220
At my age?

26:16.320 --> 26:18.700
You're what, 42?

26:18.800 --> 26:20.180
Forty-four.

26:20.280 --> 26:24.046
Well, it happens at 42
and it happens at 44.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.900
I'm going to get you a prescription
for paracetamol.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.765
We'll start there
and see how it progresses, okay?

26:31.400 --> 26:34.131
Have you had your eyes checked recently?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.887
I have genetically great eyes.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.940
You're growing up.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.041
It's weird, you know?

26:40.160 --> 26:41.260
I'm at that age where things you think

26:41.360 --> 26:43.681
are only going to happen
when you get older are actually happening.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.260
If I'm going to be
totally honest with myself,

26:45.360 --> 26:46.820
I don't think I'm ever going to die.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.540
- I know that's crazy.
- It's crazy.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.369
I think I'm pathologically happy.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.660
I mean, Cornelia and I,

26:51.760 --> 26:54.540
for a while, the fact
that we got married was so amazing.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.180
I mean, we were married!

26:56.280 --> 26:59.887
Now we're just married, you know?

27:00.240 --> 27:01.340
Do you ever feel that?

27:01.440 --> 27:02.885
Best decision I ever made.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.340
- I really like this place.
- Hey!

27:05.440 --> 27:07.180
I got my first response on Facebook.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.328
- Yeah?
- This guy, Kent Arlington.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.329
I haven't seen him
since high school in Santa Cruz.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.380
Did you flesh it out more, the idea?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.300
A little, yeah.
He's living in Poughkeepsie.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.528
Tipper and I are gonna
ride the old zip there and find him.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.764
- Shit.
- What?

27:20.040 --> 27:22.520
My father-in-law. What is he doing here?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.620
- Where?
- How are you?

27:25.720 --> 27:27.500
Good, Leslie, you?

27:27.600 --> 27:29.568
Good. Gearing up for my memorial.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.980
Leslie is having a tribute
at Lincoln Center next month.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.180
What are you doing here?

27:34.280 --> 27:35.380
How do you even know about this place?

27:35.480 --> 27:37.926
Are you kidding? I've been coming here
for pizza since it opened.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.420
This is Jamie, my friend.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.700
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

27:41.800 --> 27:45.140
but both Wedding
and Arlo Takes a Bath changed my life.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.980
It made me want
to tell stories in the non-fiction mode.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.081
Thank you.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.500
No, thank you for your films.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.700
- How's my daughter?
- How does she seem to you?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.848
- Seems well.
- So, why are you asking me?

27:56.240 --> 27:58.820
Cornelia tells me
you're looking for finishing money.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.220
Maybe. It depends on the grant.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.129
If this guy leaves his wife or not.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.780
I met a guy, hedge fund or something,

28:03.880 --> 28:05.540
he's interested
in putting money into docs.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.005
I can arrange a meeting if you want.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.963
- I think I'm okay.
- Don't be proud, Josh.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.460
I'll call you with his number tomorrow.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.846
- Okay.
- Nice to have met you.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.041
Same.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.340
Jeez Louise, working with him
must've been astonishing.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.420
It's complicated.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.860
I felt I was seen as his protégé,

28:26.960 --> 28:29.580
and I married his daughter.
I needed to establish my own voice.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.082
I think he thought I rejected him,
or that I was arrogant.

28:33.760 --> 28:34.900
I don't know. Maybe I was.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.180
But you'll take that meeting?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.380
- Probably not.
- You have to, Yosh.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.164
I mean, money's money, right?

28:40.280 --> 28:41.691
Yeah, but I never pitch.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.540
I just don't think in sound bites.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.007
I understand we're a culture
of sound bites, but...

28:46.120 --> 28:48.380
I'll help you, you know,
make it sound beautiful.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.165
It is beautiful,
but beautiful to some suit.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.300
- Maybe.
- You can totally say no to this,

28:56.400 --> 28:58.641
but would you have any interest
in co-directing with me?

29:01.680 --> 29:03.489
No, it's your thing.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.940
Isn't it? Yeah, it should be your thing.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.008
- I totally get it, yeah.
- Yeah, it should be your thing.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.682
- I got this.
- Cool.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.060
Shall we go?

29:17.160 --> 29:19.367
You go ahead, I got to take a leak.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.044
This was fun. Thanks.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.160
He just asked me to co-direct
like it was nothing.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.140
I've been trained to hoard credit.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.700
- These kids are so generous.
- Yeah, I know.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.881
Yeah.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.940
What do you mean, "you know"?
Which part?

29:55.040 --> 29:56.420
About credit.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.940
My dad always said that about you.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.660
You don't collaborate well.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.780
He "always" said that? What's "always"?

30:01.880 --> 30:03.460
I don't know, twice.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.130
Remember that time
I wanted to do that thing

30:05.240 --> 30:08.940
about the public school in the Bronx,
and you were really excited about it

30:09.040 --> 30:10.500
until I suggested we do it together

30:10.600 --> 30:13.460
and then you...
Then you just kind of dropped it.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.700
Well, maybe we should have done it.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.780
We still could.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.245
The time's passed.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.140
Sorry about that.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.924
I want to be better about that stuff.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.840
Thanks.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.620
What is that, a hoedown?

30:30.720 --> 30:32.210
Hip-hop.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.260
Hey, Fox!

30:34.360 --> 30:35.805
Fox, do you guys want to come

30:35.920 --> 30:37.365
- to the Connecticut house this weekend?
- Hey, honey...

30:37.480 --> 30:38.860
Connecticut this weekend?

30:38.960 --> 30:40.325
No, we have the ayahuasca.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.500
Where's the cardboard sleeve
for this Wilco CD?

30:42.600 --> 30:43.980
What's on it?

30:44.080 --> 30:45.700
The same image that's on the CD.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.260
Why do you need it?
The CD is right there.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.340
I don't know. It makes it special.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.500
It'll be us and Pepper

30:51.600 --> 30:53.700
and her husband Reade
and Elise and Dwight.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.140
And then Willow, Oscar and Peter,
who they're calling Nemo.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.020
That's a lot of people.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.500
Well, the last three are infants.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.807
Yeah, I know. It's just we've got this

31:02.920 --> 31:05.340
ayahuasca ceremony
this weekend with Jamie and Darby.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.020
What's an ayahuasca ceremony?

31:07.120 --> 31:09.860
I guess there's a shaman
and you have to wear white clothes

31:09.960 --> 31:14.380
and you drink this sludgy liquid
that is made from a Peruvian root

31:14.480 --> 31:17.290
and you hallucinate
and vomit up your demons.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.620
Okay.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.540
Well, we're just having a cookout
and maybe playing charades.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.860
Yeah, no, it sounds great.
It's just bad timing.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.460
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, bye, Fox.

31:27.560 --> 31:28.800
Bye, Fox.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.980
Supposedly, everyone sees
Egyptian imagery.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.100
Oh, yeah?

32:00.200 --> 32:02.580
I want to clear some father issues.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.841
You?

32:05.640 --> 32:06.980
I don't know.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.060
It's good to have a focus.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.767
Broken hearts and broken wings

32:13.600 --> 32:14.940
Sing the song...

32:15.040 --> 32:16.565
Fear of death?

32:17.920 --> 32:20.526
You know,
linear time not being such a big deal.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.922
- What's the bucket for?
- Puking.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.882
Sing the song you are here to sing.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.329
Welcome to the light.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.521
Breathe in light, breathe out darkness.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.091
Breathe in love.

32:46.800 --> 32:47.847
This is our 20s.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.565
I'm 43.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.566
Breathe out fear.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.291
Breathe in truth, breathe out ignorance.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.889
Welcome to the work.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.220
This shaman is kind of a d-bag.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.449
We're purging dark energies past pain.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.082
- That's my bucket.
- I'm puking out your shit!

34:00.440 --> 34:02.340
Honey, I feel it.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.764
Oh, my God, I see a fucking pyramid.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.205
And a sphinx.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.007
It's true, you see Egyptian shit.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.060
Honey, what are you seeing?

34:14.159 --> 34:16.400
I'm in a deli in Bensonhurst.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.780
I don't believe
in any state-supported art.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.962
I think you need to just do it yourself.

34:24.159 --> 34:27.739
The serpent, Apep, is speaking to me.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.764
He's... He's saying,

34:30.880 --> 34:33.645
"Go to the cattle of Ra."

34:35.440 --> 34:38.420
The Celestial Cow is waiting.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.284
I voted for Romney.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.060
Watch the carpet.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.060
I was falling asleep today
on the L train

34:50.159 --> 34:53.083
and you know how your brain
gets in these loops?

34:54.040 --> 34:57.010
I couldn't remember
the shape of a pineapple.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.209
Are they like pears?

35:00.040 --> 35:03.249
No, they're like footballs
with the ends cut off.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.921
It's hard
to call to mind the shapes of things.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.690
Do you find that?

35:12.720 --> 35:15.260
- It's not dangerous?
- No, I mean, I can...

35:15.360 --> 35:17.300
I can take the medicine
and I can still have my boat.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.020
I ran a half marathon
on the medicine one time.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.220
How big is your boat?

35:21.320 --> 35:22.810
It's 42 feet.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.300
I want to do that.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.926
I feel like you were born
1,000 years ago.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.500
Maybe don't flirt with the shaman.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.001
He was telling me about his boat.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.526
What?

35:41.440 --> 35:44.860
I wish you'd look at me
the way you look at Jamie and Darby.

35:44.960 --> 35:45.961
I look at you that way.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.923
No, you don't. You used to.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.407
When we first met,
you were like you are with them,

35:50.640 --> 35:53.086
you wooed me with romantic emails.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.683
It wouldn't make sense for me
to send you emails now.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.848
We're in the same room all the time.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.650
I just wish I could feel that energy
from you once in a while.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.730
Josh, I'm sorry.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.289
You taste different.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.451
- Josh?
- It's me.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.921
Jamie?

36:26.240 --> 36:28.447
Shit. I thought you were Josh.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.770
I'm so fucked up.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.168
I... I'm really sorry.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.284
It's okay, worm.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.242
Let's never do that again.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.660
It stopped working.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.285
Cornelia?

37:17.080 --> 37:19.287
Mine stopped working anymore.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.050
Nothing is happening.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.289
How you doing, Yosh?

37:29.760 --> 37:31.410
Is yours working? Mine isn't working.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.006
Mine's working.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.620
What if I don't find anything out?

37:37.720 --> 37:40.371
Just roll with it.
You're going to be fine, see.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.365
Thanks, Jamie.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.363
You're so kind. And so generous.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.366
I'm so proud and selfish.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.888
I want to be generous like you.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.940
I want to help you with your film.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.540
I'll come to Poughkeepsie
and help you film the guy.

38:00.640 --> 38:03.923
And I don't want credit or anything,
just to help out.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.420
Thanks, Joshy, that's beautiful.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.649
Before we met,
the only two feelings I had left were

38:10.640 --> 38:14.247
wistful and disdainful.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.409
And being around you,

38:19.080 --> 38:21.208
I see what's possible again.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.020
Is that corny?

38:25.120 --> 38:27.043
It's goddamn corny, Joshy.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.045
Yeah, I guess it is.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.845
I'm a cornball.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.561
- Thanks.
- No problem, Jussle.

38:49.360 --> 38:53.046
It's still tonight for us,
but it's tomorrow for everyone else.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.660
Let's have kids.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.762
Or a kid. Something.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.500
Did the Celestial Cow tell you this?

39:01.600 --> 39:02.700
Yes.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.167
But that doesn't make it any less true.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.486
All these people have babies,
what's the big deal?

39:09.480 --> 39:11.403
I thought we'd decided.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.008
I don't want this to be
every time you take a hallucinogen,

39:14.120 --> 39:16.380
you want to have a baby.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.050
Not every time.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.770
We missed our chance.
I missed my chance.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.204
I'm fine with that.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.844
Is that the shaman's Vespa?

39:36.280 --> 39:38.044
You're playing Nintendo

39:38.200 --> 39:41.602
That's not what I'm doing
That's not what I'm doing

39:41.720 --> 39:43.540
You're surfing the web

39:43.640 --> 39:47.201
That's not what I'm doing
That's not what I'm doing

39:47.320 --> 39:48.940
You're crying your eyes out

39:49.040 --> 39:52.540
That's not what I'm doing
That's not what I'm doing

39:52.640 --> 39:55.689
- I'm making a sandwich
- I'm making a sandwich

39:55.960 --> 39:57.020
- Fun.
- Nice.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.620
Connecticut has the best thrifting.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.140
He'll drop us off
before they do their filming.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.420
Tipper and I started a band
called Cookie O'Puss.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.760
Have you seen that on YouTube?

40:04.880 --> 40:06.540
Yeah, that was a commercial
when I was a kid.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.020
It's fucking hilarious.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.531
I know, we used to always do the voice.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.764
- My name is Cookie O'Puss!
- My name is Cookie O'Puss!

40:13.320 --> 40:15.322
It's the name of our band.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.687
My name is Cookie O'Puss!

40:25.080 --> 40:26.206
Fudgie the Whale?

40:26.920 --> 40:28.081
- All right, you ready?
- Yep.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.020
He was this, kind of,
beautiful combination

40:31.120 --> 40:33.980
of jock and brain, and he could sing.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.300
He was in the a cappella group
called the Night Owls.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.846
I mean, kind of the perfect guy.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.780
Hey, I called. My name's Jamie,

40:54.880 --> 40:56.860
I'm a friend of Kent's.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.564
Kent isn't here.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.889
Will he be back soon?

41:03.200 --> 41:05.420
- What's...
- We went to school together.

41:05.520 --> 41:09.206
It's been a while, but he contacted me
recently on Facebook.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.489
It would mean a lot to me
if I could see him.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.806
I don't bite.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.500
I told my sister I had an accident,

41:50.600 --> 41:52.090
but that's not true.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.449
I've been unhappy.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.251
I did it to myself.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.886
I cut my wrists.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.210
You were the guy.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.140
You know, you were beautiful.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.811
I mean, you dated Jenny Pepperdine.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.060
You know, I bought a necklace
like the one you used to wear.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.208
- Of puka shells?
- Yeah.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.930
You know, I was going through
a tough time in high school.

42:17.400 --> 42:20.722
My mom was really sick
with ovarian cancer,

42:23.600 --> 42:25.648
I was pretty promiscuous,
but I couldn't love anyone.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.130
I had body issues.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.140
You had written a poem for English,

42:32.240 --> 42:35.060
I mean, you were this athlete,
and you wrote this beautiful poem.

42:35.160 --> 42:37.128
Do you know what poem I'm talking about?

42:38.320 --> 42:40.687
- I wrote a lot of poems.
- It was a line,

42:42.320 --> 42:45.802
very simple, but effective,
"I want to be unbridgeable."

42:51.120 --> 42:54.841
You know, that one line
got me through my mother's illness.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.166
Yeah?

43:00.760 --> 43:03.286
I don't know why I stopped
writing poetry.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.727
I stopped doing a lot of things.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.248
Why do we stop doing things?

43:11.440 --> 43:13.020
Life happens I guess, huh?

43:13.120 --> 43:14.700
Life has other plans.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.300
Yeah.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.290
Life is what happens
when you're making other plans.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.761
Who is he?

43:36.880 --> 43:39.060
He was soulful-ish, you know.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.700
Sister, that's an understatement.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.860
You can tell he's been
to some dark places.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.700
We went to some dark places, too.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.041
I bought a dress.
Cornelia didn't buy a corset.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.660
This burger is incredible.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.780
Holy shit.

43:50.880 --> 43:51.860
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.660
I just googled Kent. Did you Google him?

43:54.760 --> 43:56.380
No, I wanted it to be fresh.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.740
This is...
There's a picture, it's the same guy.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.060
He was in Afghanistan.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:01.400 --> 44:05.246
He... This article says
he was part of a massacre in Wanat.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.700
They opened fire on a bus
full of civilians.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.420
He then spoke out about it publicly.

44:10.520 --> 44:11.726
And then refused to fight.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.166
He was jailed briefly,

44:13.400 --> 44:16.300
then returned to battle,
was injured and given the Purple Heart.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.526
You're kidding?

44:19.960 --> 44:22.020
It says two men in his unit
have killed themselves.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.140
Tipper.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.446
Could you do it again, what you did?

44:24.920 --> 44:25.900
Which part?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.445
The phone, the discovery, everything.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.644
It's the same guy.

44:37.480 --> 44:38.925
Is that how I said it? What did I say?

44:40.920 --> 44:42.604
It's the same guy!

44:43.200 --> 44:44.620
Holy shit!

44:44.720 --> 44:45.767
Jamie, look at this.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.808
It says two men in his unit
have killed themselves.

44:51.320 --> 44:52.845
- We have to go back.
- Yeah?

44:52.960 --> 44:54.020
We have to get him talking about this.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.281
This is the movie!

44:55.440 --> 44:57.329
Now it's not just
some stupid Facebook thing.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.260
Not that that wasn't a good idea, too.

44:59.360 --> 45:02.443
But, and I hate this expression,
but you stepped in shit!

45:03.600 --> 45:05.250
- Cornelia!
- What?

45:06.200 --> 45:07.860
Thank God I've got you, Joshy!
We did what you said.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.769
We didn't know the answers,
we discovered them.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.563
I should get a good book on Afghanistan.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.287
And war in general.
I really know so little about it.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.140
You know who you should talk to?

45:17.240 --> 45:18.366
Ira Mandelstam,

45:18.960 --> 45:20.020
the guy who's in my film.

45:20.120 --> 45:22.580
He could tell you
a lot about war and the politics of war.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.580
That's your guy, though, Joshy.
I can't take your guy.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.806
I don't care.
I want to share him with you.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.620
Jeez Louise,
that would be fucking beautiful.

45:29.720 --> 45:33.884
You know, if you want help,
I could help or produce this for you.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.540
My dad's between things right now.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.500
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

45:37.600 --> 45:39.460
I would be so pumped.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.881
Thank you, thank you.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.083
Thank you!

45:48.800 --> 45:53.169
He's been cooped up with a baby at home,
and Marina loves these soup dumplings.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.260
This will be a great surprise.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.900
I haven't spoken to Fletcher in a while.
I think he's exhausted.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.446
We'll probably be waking them up.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.050
Cornelia, Josh.

46:28.880 --> 46:30.780
Gaby! Mike.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.740
- You look amazing!
- Thank you. So do you.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.046
You look good.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.847
Hi.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.371
Fucking shit.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.860
Are you guys having a thing?

46:43.960 --> 46:45.485
Yeah, we...

46:46.040 --> 46:47.260
God, this is embarrassing.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.940
Is it a baby thing?

46:49.040 --> 46:51.008
No, actually, Willow's at my mother's.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.140
We weren't invited.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.500
- Well, we didn't think...
- Oh, God, I don't know what to say.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.060
Hey, girly girl.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.300
- Hey!
- Hey.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.100
- You look fine!
- Thank you.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.180
Hey, Cornelia, how are you?

47:04.280 --> 47:05.260
- Hey, Grace.
- Hi.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.124
- Come inside, there's a full bar.
- Hey.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.561
What's going on?

47:09.680 --> 47:11.460
I'm sorry.
We didn't think you'd want to come.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.060
- Why?
- Well, for one thing,

47:13.160 --> 47:14.491
these are people our own age.

47:14.600 --> 47:15.620
Come on!

47:15.720 --> 47:17.460
And maybe you have
a titseeka ceremony or something.

47:17.560 --> 47:18.620
Ayahuasca!

47:18.720 --> 47:21.780
It was therapeutic. I learned some shit.
I think Cornelia did, too.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.803
Yeah, I did, too. Learn some shit.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.900
Hey, you guys were wacked out
on Peruvian mescaline,

47:26.000 --> 47:27.340
of course you'll learn some shit.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.980
I went under during a colonoscopy
last week, I learned some shit.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.860
Don't patronize us, man.

47:31.960 --> 47:35.328
Listen, we don't know how else to say this,
but we're worried about you guys.

47:35.440 --> 47:36.500
Yeah, you know...

47:36.600 --> 47:38.420
I mean, I respect the fact
that you don't want to have kids.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.740
Don't make this
about the baby cult, okay, Marina?

47:40.840 --> 47:42.700
I don't appreciate
that kind of superior attitude.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.620
- It's really ugly.
- That's not what I'm saying.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.340
I can't help it
if I want you to have kids.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.500
We think you guys would
really benefit from it. That's all.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.700
You don't realize how inappropriate it is
to say it the way you say it.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.740
Not everybody wants a baby!

47:53.840 --> 47:56.020
Not everyone can have one all the time.

47:56.120 --> 47:58.407
- Hi, sexy lady!
- Elise! Come in.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.780
Bruce! Come in.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.780
- Thank you.
- Hey, you've lost weight.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.900
Yeah. It's my suit.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.380
Since we've had the baby, I feel you
pulling away, Cornelia. I just do.

48:07.480 --> 48:08.660
- What's with the hat?
- What?

48:08.760 --> 48:10.220
I went to a fucking
baby music class with you!

48:10.320 --> 48:11.860
You look like assholes
we went to high school with,

48:11.960 --> 48:13.220
who'd cruise by prom but not go in.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.740
Do you know how humiliating that is?

48:14.840 --> 48:16.460
- We're old men, Josh.
- Speak for yourself.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.300
Why is that humiliating?
This is my life now.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.700
You're an old man with a hat.

48:19.800 --> 48:22.060
It can be very isolating and lonely
when you have a kid.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.321
Yeah, I can tell.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.410
- Let's go, Josh.
- Stay.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.220
You're here. Come in.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.004
There's no way we're coming in.

48:43.480 --> 48:47.201
The idea of the war
on terrorism can be understood

48:47.320 --> 48:50.020
in terms of a new idea of war.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.380
"Infinite justice,"
they called it at first.

48:52.480 --> 48:56.420
In which the rules
of domestic and international law

48:56.520 --> 48:58.500
could forever be suspended.

48:58.600 --> 49:02.500
I say permanent and forever
because there is no way

49:02.600 --> 49:06.220
to ever fully eradicate terrorism.

49:06.320 --> 49:10.020
So, the first step
in the war on terrorism

49:10.120 --> 49:12.361
is to declare war on...

49:18.200 --> 49:20.851
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- What?

49:21.720 --> 49:24.100
- Can I say something I'm ashamed of?
- Yeah.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.260
It's not generous.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.100
- And I probably don't really mean it.
- Okay. Go.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.060
- I think Jamie's great.
- Just say it!

49:29.160 --> 49:32.260
I can't fucking believe
his idiotic Facebook idea paid off!

49:32.360 --> 49:34.700
It's so fucking stupid!

49:34.800 --> 49:38.043
And my thing is a mess.
It's a total fucking mess.

49:39.120 --> 49:41.566
I'm sorry. I feel bad saying that.

49:42.240 --> 49:45.801
But I also hate the fact
that he's calling his band Cookie O'Puss.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.260
What's wrong with that?

49:47.360 --> 49:50.300
It's just some funny old kitschy thing
to him he saw on YouTube.

49:50.400 --> 49:54.940
But that was my commercial.
I actually experienced it. You know?

49:55.040 --> 49:56.700
I don't know it from Cookie Puss.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.531
Really? It was for Carvel.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.900
Cookie Puss was the original, then they did
an ice cream cake for Saint Patrick's Day

50:03.000 --> 50:07.847
and it was this floating green Irish cake
that said, "My name is Cookie O'Puss."

50:09.840 --> 50:11.649
I'm being ridiculous.

50:12.320 --> 50:14.340
I probably don't mean any of it.

50:14.440 --> 50:17.660
My dad likes to say,
"The more, the more."

50:17.760 --> 50:21.740
That's because your dad has everything.
And then he gets more.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.780
He's right. There's enough
to go around for everyone.

50:23.880 --> 50:27.726
Joshy! You gotta pitch.
Let's go get you some hedge fund cash.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.485
Good luck.

50:32.160 --> 50:34.860
Remember, ask him questions.
You're interviewing him.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.900
He'd be goddamn lucky
to invest in your film.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.820
- Okay.
- And talk about shit he understands, see.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.285
Short and to the point.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.368
Ride on the street, man!

50:43.200 --> 50:46.100
Psych him up.
Talk about war, talk about power, race.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.940
Make it relevant to him.

50:48.040 --> 50:51.420
- Right.
- Be yourself, everyone else is taken.

50:51.520 --> 50:53.620
Ira was beautiful today.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.860
We're gonna have a screening of
the cut footage at the apartment on Friday.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.540
You cut it already?
You just shot it two days ago.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.340
I know. I was up all night.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.500
We'll be okay, Joshy. Don't you fret.

51:03.600 --> 51:07.420
Hey, well, maybe take a day or two,
make sure you like it.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.443
Or I can take 10 years.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.380
I'm fucking with you, Joshy.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.847
Your thing is gonna be
totally brilliant.

51:19.160 --> 51:22.740
I remember when this song
was just considered bad.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.060
But it's working.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.900
Remember, he's lucky
to have this opportunity.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.500
You're friggin' Josh Srebnick.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.604
My name sounds so much better
when you say it.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.648
- You see Mad Men?
- No.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.260
It's really apple juice.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.441
Nah, it's whiskey.

51:45.920 --> 51:47.410
No, it's not.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.320
It is.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.940
So, tell me about your project.

51:54.040 --> 51:57.540
Well, maybe a good way to start
is by asking you a question.

51:57.640 --> 51:59.404
Hey, they were all raped
when I got there.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.931
This is my second in 20 minutes. Shoot.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.420
Do you know the percentage

52:05.520 --> 52:08.100
of African-American adult males
currently in jail?

52:08.200 --> 52:10.260
- I don't.
- Take a guess.

52:10.360 --> 52:11.885
Like 60%?

52:12.720 --> 52:14.020
Jesus, no.

52:14.120 --> 52:16.140
It's over 9%.

52:16.240 --> 52:21.121
That's nearly 1 -in-10 African-American
adult males, nearly a million and a half.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.380
A million and a half is a lot.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.380
It's insane, but people
don't realize this.

52:25.480 --> 52:27.140
They think because we have
a black president...

52:27.240 --> 52:29.540
So this is about prison.
Like a black Shawshank.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.802
- But real.
- No, not... No.

52:32.560 --> 52:35.100
There's a section, an entr'acte really,

52:35.200 --> 52:37.282
about the function of race
in the prison industrial complex,

52:37.840 --> 52:41.180
but the film is really
about how power works in America.

52:41.280 --> 52:43.300
Do you know the historian
Ira Mandelstam?

52:43.400 --> 52:44.460
- Yeah.
- Really?

52:44.560 --> 52:45.766
No.

52:46.760 --> 52:49.300
Well, we have over 100 hours
of interviews with him.

52:49.400 --> 52:50.860
The movie's 100 hours?

52:50.960 --> 52:52.803
No, we'll cut it.

52:53.920 --> 52:57.020
Now, this guy, he's...
He isn't particularly charismatic,

52:57.120 --> 52:59.740
he's kind of anti-social,
maybe Asperger's,

52:59.840 --> 53:02.260
but not interesting Asperger's.

53:02.360 --> 53:05.260
He's kind of boring, even.
But he's a charismatic thinker.

53:05.360 --> 53:07.380
How do you show
what he thinks? Cartoons?

53:07.480 --> 53:10.220
No, not cartoons. He says it.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.460
- But he's boring.
- Well, yes.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.500
But as with many boring things,

53:13.600 --> 53:16.126
the longer you watch it,
it takes on a different dimension.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.569
It's really a very simple idea.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.220
The three sections correspond
with the three nodes

53:21.320 --> 53:23.700
of what Mills called the power elite.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.060
The political, military
and economic. But,

53:26.160 --> 53:28.527
and this is key,
each part has to interconnect

53:28.640 --> 53:30.540
to show how none of the three nodes

53:30.640 --> 53:32.340
functions without the other.

53:32.440 --> 53:36.490
It's a linear film, of course,
but I imagine it as kind of a hypertext.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.860
So, what's it about?

53:42.960 --> 53:45.020
To be clear, the film is really
about the working class,

53:45.120 --> 53:47.540
and I can't speak on behalf
of the working class.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.380
I can't make their film, of course.

53:49.480 --> 53:53.929
But they have to be felt
as the impossible subject of the text.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.326
If that makes sense.

53:55.440 --> 53:57.140
But it isn't even really
about the power structure

53:57.240 --> 53:59.940
but about what it means
to make a film about it.

54:00.040 --> 54:03.420
It's about the very possibility
of making this film.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.887
It's really about America.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.060
Hi.

54:22.160 --> 54:24.820
Just been working
on my speech for my memorial.

54:24.920 --> 54:27.340
- What's on your mind, son?
- Could you watch what I have?

54:27.440 --> 54:29.681
I think I'm at the point
where I need a new set of eyes.

54:29.800 --> 54:33.260
Well, working on the same project
for 10 years will do that to you.

54:33.360 --> 54:34.566
Yeah.

54:36.520 --> 54:41.208
And the military created the Internet

54:41.680 --> 54:44.001
as part of an overall strategy.

54:44.760 --> 54:48.100
I'm not just talking
about Google collaborating with the NSA.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.328
I'm talking about far deeper...

55:20.240 --> 55:23.005
I'm gonna put a kettle on.
You want some tea?

55:23.560 --> 55:24.721
Okay.

55:26.040 --> 55:28.900
Well, you've got a lot
of good material there.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.729
Need some time to process it.

55:32.080 --> 55:34.740
Do you need the stuff
about Turkish politics?

55:34.840 --> 55:38.500
Yes, because it connects to what
he's saying about the shift in power

55:38.600 --> 55:40.180
in the contemporary global economy.

55:40.280 --> 55:42.660
All right. But it feels like a detour.

55:42.760 --> 55:45.580
What about the lengthy history
of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire?

55:45.680 --> 55:46.700
You need that?

55:46.800 --> 55:48.723
The interview with Tillie Kupferschmidst's
great-great niece?

55:49.960 --> 55:51.820
That's the emotional center
of the movie.

55:51.920 --> 55:53.860
I mean, that's where things
come together.

55:53.960 --> 55:56.700
Without that, I don't, I...
I mean, why make the film?

55:56.800 --> 55:59.980
- Yeah. But it's too long.
- It has to be long.

56:00.080 --> 56:01.940
The point is,
it makes you uncomfortable.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.929
I wasn't uncomfortable, I was bored.

56:04.040 --> 56:08.180
Well, maybe the boredom
is your defense from the discomfort.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.100
You just showed me
a six-and-a-half hour film

56:10.200 --> 56:13.860
that feels like it's seven hours too long.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

56:13.960 --> 56:15.220
I think I need to shoot more interviews.

56:15.320 --> 56:17.380
Don't shoot any more! You have enough.

56:17.480 --> 56:18.780
Yeah, I just don't think
you're getting it,

56:18.880 --> 56:21.180
or maybe there's something about me

56:21.280 --> 56:23.060
or what you saw
that's clouding your judgment.

56:23.160 --> 56:24.700
I'm telling you how I really feel.

56:24.800 --> 56:27.740
I don't think so. I think
you're being deliberately critical.

56:27.840 --> 56:30.127
- Josh, I'm trying to help you.
- Bullshit!

56:30.480 --> 56:32.420
Is this because Cornelia
and I didn't have children?

56:32.520 --> 56:33.700
Come on, Josh.

56:33.800 --> 56:36.246
We tried. There were miscarriages.

56:37.160 --> 56:40.380
I had to give her a shot
in her ass every day for three months.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.180
It was a huge fucking needle.

56:42.280 --> 56:43.620
She didn't tell me that.

56:43.720 --> 56:45.380
I didn't know you guys wanted kids.

56:45.480 --> 56:49.007
We didn't wanna hope
for what we probably couldn't have.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.740
This was a mistake.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.330
Sorry you feel that way.

56:55.480 --> 56:59.180
I know you think
I didn't reach my potential.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.540
No, son. I don't think you did.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.980
Your first film
was wonderful and entertaining.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.180
We could see ourselves in it.

57:06.280 --> 57:09.250
This one feels ungenerous,
it's like you took your ball and went home.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.740
You know what?
I'm sorry I didn't become you.

57:11.840 --> 57:14.300
- I don't want you to become me.
- Yeah, right.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.780
I'll see you at Thanksgiving.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.300
Yeah, I'm not going to eat
another fucking fried turkey, FYI.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.050
Then bring your own!

58:29.440 --> 58:30.420
Yoshy!

58:30.520 --> 58:32.443
- There's my other half.
- You invited Breitbart?

58:32.800 --> 58:35.087
Yeah, he called me
after you introduced us.

58:35.480 --> 58:36.700
- He called you?
- Yeah.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.300
And at our dinner,
I invited him to tonight.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.620
When did you have dinner?

58:39.720 --> 58:41.500
After he called me,
he suggested we get dinner.

58:41.600 --> 58:42.580
Where'd you go?

58:42.680 --> 58:44.980
This really incredible joint
on the Upper West Side.

58:45.080 --> 58:46.660
- Jackson Hole.
- Yeah! How'd you know?

58:46.760 --> 58:49.180
- That's where he goes.
- Great burgers. Have you been there?

58:49.280 --> 58:50.620
Yes, I've been there
with him a million times.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.900
- Have you tried the Bison Burger?
- Of course.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.764
He dug the footage.

58:56.760 --> 58:57.980
Is something wrong?

58:58.080 --> 59:01.940
I guess I wish you'd asked me
before you just went to him.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.180
Hey, I'm sorry. I called him actually
just to ask him a question

59:04.280 --> 59:06.900
about how he shot something,
and we got to talking, see,

59:07.000 --> 59:08.420
and he asked me what I was working on.

59:08.520 --> 59:09.700
- So, you called him?
- What?

59:09.800 --> 59:11.848
- You said he called you.
- Well, he called me back, yeah.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.080
Does Cornelia know?

59:14.560 --> 59:17.325
Very cool! Very cool.

59:19.560 --> 59:20.780
I'm proud to be a part of it.

59:20.880 --> 59:22.620
- Dave, you know Josh.
- Nice to meet you.

59:22.720 --> 59:26.100
Seriously, dude, this movie is kill-ah!

59:26.200 --> 59:29.660
We're going to Afghanistan,
we're going to Afghanistan.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.444
Afghanistan, Afghanistan.

59:33.080 --> 59:34.500
You're going to Afghanistan?

59:34.600 --> 59:35.900
To interview soldiers in Kent's unit.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.740
We've got a butt-load of work to do
before we go. I'm gonna need help.

59:38.840 --> 59:41.002
We're going to Afghanistan!

59:42.040 --> 59:43.451
Come on.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.411
If you have any other editing work,

59:47.520 --> 59:49.900
my guy, Tim, is great
and could use some cash.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.580
- That would be beautiful.
- Yo, come with me.

59:51.680 --> 59:53.523
I want you to meet Diane,
she's a reporter from The Times.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.169
I'll text you his info.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.125
Do you forget that I exist?

59:58.240 --> 59:59.580
No, I don't forget you exist.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.220
I asked you for a beer
like a half hour ago.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.220
Why don't you just give me
a minute, okay?

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.687
You're such an asshole.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.260
I've been looking for you.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.860
You're smoking?

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.300
What's going on? What is...
This is like a fucking bad dream.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.580
Everyone here is doing weird shit.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.082
Where's my high school algebra teacher,
Mr. Morelli, riding a fucking turtle?

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.409
I had no idea Dad was coming.
I saw him when I got here.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.780
Are you sure? Are you sure
you're not just saying that?

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.980
Yes, Josh. Why would I lie to you?

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.620
Do you think that Jamie came to my class
because he knew that I was married to you?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.620
That this was all
so he could meet your dad?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.008
Josh, you know,
the world isn't a conspiracy against you.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.460
You know, fuck you.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.380
Fuck you. Don't talk to me like that.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.540
I'm saying "fuck you"
the way Jamie and Darby say it

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.220
where it's not a real "fuck you,"
it's a semi-playful "fuck you."

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.460
We're not Jamie and Darby.
We don't talk to each other that way.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.020
If you say "fuck you" to me,
it feels like a real "fuck you."

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.300
- It is real.
- Fuck you. And not semi-playfully either.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.007
Fuck you. Total, real,
cutting-to-the-core, fuck you.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.287
Darby? Are you okay?

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.644
Shit's bad.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.284
You wanna get some goat?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.140
Crushes fade.
Things lose their luster, you know?

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.820
Maybe I'm just down
on relationships right now.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.900
What about Jamie?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.843
Jamie's in love with Jamie.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.443
But you guys seemed great.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.527
You know how no one
will ever pick up just a male hitchhiker,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.020
but if it's a couple,
you might pull over?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.727
Well, I'm the girl
so you'll pull over and pick up Jamie.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.700
Doing ayahuasca, I realized

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.168
I never forgave my mom for dying,

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.260
and until I do,

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.931
I'll never have a decent relationship
with a guy.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.642
- When did she die?
- When I was in high school.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.810
She had ovarian cancer.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.971
I'm sorry.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.842
Isn't that also how Jamie's mom died?

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.921
He talked about it in the film.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.368
Why'd you let Jamie use your scholar?

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.481
I was trying out being generous.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.043
He'd do the same for me.
That's how you guys are.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.004
Oh, Josh.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.362
You're such a man-fox.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.891
Man-fox?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.340
I wish it didn't need
the "man" qualifier.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.681
Because you're like a hot dad.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.610
Without children.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.685
We shouldn't.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.100
This is the part
where I say, "I was a bet."

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.180
What?

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.523
You know those romantic comedies
when the girl is a bet?

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.220
Yeah. Just because they did,
doesn't mean we have to.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.926
What? What do you mean?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.220
She never told you?

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.820
Jamie and Cornelia made out
at the ayahuasca.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.400
It was in the papyrus reeds
behind the pyramids.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.204
I'm sorry, I stole one
of Tipper's Adderalls.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.126
Do you wanna go dancing?

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.321
Yeah.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.528
I'm not going home tonight.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.126
Thanks for meeting me so early.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.660
We've got a butt-load to do.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.140
Dave needs a budget for Afghanistan.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.446
I'm almost finished with it.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.060
I've been reading a lot
about Afghanistan. It's crazy.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.860
You know no one has ever been able
to successfully occupy Afghanistan?

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.980
I've heard that.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.100
But I think we've got something now.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.420
With your help,
it can really be something.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.124
Leslie's notes were beautiful.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.124
He's smart that way.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.607
And really chill to kick it with.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.845
I'm sorry, I...

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.567
Josh and I had a fight last night
and he didn't come home.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.081
Hey.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.289
Hey, hey.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.284
It's going to be okay.
Joshy will come back.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.371
Thank you.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.540
I'm sorry I'm like this.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.290
Hey, no worries.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.644
I was thinking, maybe you and your dad
would wanna work on my thing together.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.860
He seems to wanna get involved.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.540
It might be kind of great, right?

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.460
I mean, you're producing,
but he could bless it, essentially.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.220
Bless it? Like a sneeze?

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.243
No. I was thinking more like the Pope.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.860
He doesn't really do that kind of thing.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.088
Well, I think if you asked him,
he might.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.020
Did you ever see Power Elite?

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.167
What's that?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.420
Josh's movie! God damn, yes.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.580
I told him that.
I loved that scene with the dogs.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.140
When you went to Josh's class,

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.220
you knew Josh and I were married,
didn't you?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.924
And that Leslie was my dad.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.820
Hey, I admire lots of people.
I want lots of things.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.527
You know what I mean. We all want stuff.
It doesn't mean we're douche bags.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.610
You're a hip chick. You kissed me,
you're married to my friend, but I get it.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.580
I thought you were Josh.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.170
The first time.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:48.320
You know, but out of context,
if other people heard about it,

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.368
it might be misconstrued.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.400
Where were you last night?

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.780
I was dancing with Darby
in an after-hours gay club.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.180
Is this some kind of a private meeting?

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.900
- Did you follow me here?
- I follow him on Twitter!

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.780
We can't lie like we used
to lie anymore.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.900
Everything's reported.
Nothing is private.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.780
- There's nothing going on.
- Don't lie to me. You kissed him.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.540
- I know all about it.
- I thought he was you, Joshy.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.460
Don't call me Joshy!
You don't call me Joshy.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.660
- Sorry.
- It's all a pose.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.980
It's like he once saw a sincere person
and has been imitating him ever since!

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.420
And you're falling for it.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.760
I didn't even like them!

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.980
You convinced me how awesome they were.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.060
They're entitled little brats.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.980
And don't you see? It's all a plan.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.128
He's trying to destroy me.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.605
Go back inside!

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.100
You know what?
You and your father can have him.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.820
You always wanted a more successful me,
so go for it.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.460
What is wrong with you?

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.780
I didn't know when we got married

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.100
that you'd wanna play kissy face
with 25-year-olds.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.860
I didn't know that either. And I didn't know
that you'd never finish your movie.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.180
I'm gonna finish it!
I just need to get it right.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.363
It's obsession. It's fear.
I don't know what it is. It's...

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.060
- Please? Will you go back inside?
- What the...

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.100
It's not really about making anything.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.020
At least Jamie makes something.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.260
Do not compare what I do with him.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.443
Why not? When you felt
a part of it, you loved it.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.940
And you use your movie
as an excuse not to do anything.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.700
We don't go on vacations,
we don't make decisions,

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.940
we don't have kids.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.380
- I want a kid.
- But you want it now that it's impossible.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.220
- It's not impossible.
- No.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.540
It's over. It's done.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.406
I'm not putting myself
through that anymore. This is closed.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.008
Marina's at a work dinner.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.163
- They're both top sheets, but... You know.
- Thanks.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.900
You might wake up when I come through
for Willow's 2:00 a.m. feeding.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.220
And the 5:00 a.m. feeding.
And then all the other times she wakes up.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.322
That's okay. How is she?

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.767
Cool baby.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.367
But, to be honest,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.082
it's a little hard for me
to relate to an infant.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.124
It seems kind of cool though.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:15.580
It's like the pregnancy is its own thing.
You get so used to it.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.924
After a while, I just felt like, we did this,
we don't actually need the baby.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.845
I'm sorry if I've appeared crazy or...
I don't know.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.002
I'm sorry we didn't invite you
to the party.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.331
I think I've been jealous
of you guys having a kid.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.325
You know...

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.020
Before you have a kid,
everyone tells you,

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.060
"It's the best thing you'll ever do."

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.020
And as soon as you get the baby
back from the hospital,

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.260
those same people are like,
"Don't worry, it gets better."

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.740
I'm like,
"What the fuck was all that before?"

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.209
But having Willow must've changed
your whole perspective on life.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.609
Not as much as I'd hoped it would.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.125
I... I love my baby,

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:59.846
but I'm still
the most important person in my life.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.460
Hey, did I tell you I have
a herniated disk? L5 or some shit.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.140
I'm getting an epidural on Monday.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.447
I have arthritis in my knees.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.929
What the fuck is happening to us?

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.460
Hey.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.720
Hi.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.401
Hey, man.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.809
I'm sorry about not paying you.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.180
Yeah.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:38.283
I mean, I hoped the money
would come in, it didn't.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.765
I kind of fudged that.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.930
I just can't work for nothing, you know?

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:49.279
But thanks for hooking me up with Jamie.
I've been freelancing a bit for him.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.020
If you're not too busy there,

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.940
I wanted to hire you back
for a couple of weeks.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.980
- I can pay you.
- Did the grant money come in?

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.127
No.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.530
I sold all my CDs.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.529
And some other things.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.380
Leslie suggested
we cut the bit about Turkish politics.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.700
But I told him it was crucial...

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.900
I think it's a good idea.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.380
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.970
We got to cut something.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.128
Okay, let's give it a try.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.020
I've been unhappy...

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.327
This is Jamie's footage.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.200
Some stuff I was working on.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.129
- Wait.
- What?

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.940
Hold on that image of Kent.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.166
Okay.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.487
Blow it up.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.700
I can't do that on this machine.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.847
Really?

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.601
No.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.620
That's Darby's ice cream.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.540
It looks like mint of some kind.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.100
It's avocado. Darby was there
before we were.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.660
I got my first response on Facebook.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.740
This guy, Kent Arlington.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.380
I haven't seen him
since high school in Santa Cruz.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.060
You said
we should be open to surprises, right?

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.260
I just googled Kent. Did you Google him?

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.900
- He was in Afghanistan.
- Really?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.580
My mom was really sick
with ovarian cancer.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.660
When I was in high school.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.330
- She had ovarian cancer.
- Isn't that also how...

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.204
Thank God I've got you, Joshy!
We did what you said.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.460
We didn't know the answers.
We discovered them.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.050
Don't you see?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.007
She brought Kent the ice cream.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.528
I know Jamie's your friend,

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.161
but to be honest, he's kind of a prick.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.460
I'm playing Nintendo

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.689
That's not what I'm doing
That's not what I'm doing

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.580
I'm crying my eyes out

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.780
That's not what I'm doing
That's not what I'm doing

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.220
That's not what I'm fucking doing

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.882
I'm fucking exposing your shit
Mother fucker

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.841
Hey. Is Kent here?

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.620
Is everything okay?

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.563
My son turns nine today.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.841
Happy birthday.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.526
- You're so intense.
- I'm focusing.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.760
There.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.460
Thank you.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.340
You know, looking back on my career,
I wonder, how did I accomplish so much?

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.500
If I'm honest with myself,
it sometimes took being a selfish prick

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.580
at the expense of you and your mother.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.889
Of course, I don't say that.
I say talent, work, luck.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.340
Your husband doesn't realize
what it takes, he...

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.340
He still believes the speeches.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.180
You know, when I first started dating him,
he reminded me so much of you.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.126
He wants what I have,
but he's not merciless enough to get it.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.060
I learned magic from a dude, Alvin,
over in Afghanistan.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.209
- He was shredded by a land mine.
- That's terrible.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.163
I'm more old-fashioned in my approach.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.820
I don't lock myself up
in a box or anything,

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.580
it's mostly cards and balls.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.001
I learned from watching videos
on YouTube.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.820
It keeps me from going out of my head.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.700
Yeah, we need distractions.
For me, it's the Internet.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.420
I'm trying to go on less, you know.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.340
You know, it's like how many times
can I check The Huffington Post?

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.900
How did you fucking do that?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.729
- Louis!
- Sorry.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.890
So, what made you contact Jamie
on Facebook?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.570
What do you mean?

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.060
What made you reach out to him?

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.164
I didn't. He contacted me.
Here, you got something.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.180
Other side.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.009
I had no idea who he was.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.140
- Really?
- Yeah. He said that he lived with Darby.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.287
You remember Darby?

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.060
Yeah, Darby's been a friend for years.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.780
We'd Skype sometimes
when I was in Kandahar.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.420
The reception was really shitty, though,
it'd freeze up all the time.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.443
Did she know about...

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.500
That you were in the hospital?

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.011
Who are you again?

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.420
I'm Jamie's cameraman.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.100
And why are you asking me this stuff?

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.885
I'm fact-checking the movie.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.180
- Hey! Bring that back, you fuckers!
- Kent!

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.380
What did you think
when Jamie started talking

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.540
about Darby's childhood
as if it was his own?

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.120
He said that he was playing a part.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.369
He said that when?

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.280
He called me a week or so
before you guys came up and filmed me.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.721
Can you... Can you say that again?

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.729
Josh, it's me, again. I just...

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.580
I... I am so sorry.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.420
I hope you come to my dad's thing.
He'd like it and I'd like it.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.686
And I'm so sorry
for all the things we said and...

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.020
Can you come?
Can you call me back, please?

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.326
Where are you, Josh?

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.167
- I've got to talk to Jamie.
- He's not here.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.500
- You going somewhere?
- Tampa.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.940
If I stay here any longer,
I'll Girl, Interrupt.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.849
I was just with Kent.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.761
Kent.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.401
I love Kent.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.207
I saw your ice cream in Jamie's video.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.451
Well played, sir.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.060
He let me think I was the one
who found out about Kent in Afghanistan.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.180
Why?

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.100
Jamie doesn't wanna disappoint you.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.726
None of us wanna disappoint you.
You're such a purist.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.140
Jamie would never have made
the movie without Afghanistan.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.860
When I told him about Kent
and the massacre,

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.540
he thought it would make a good movie.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.130
He just had to figure out
how to tell it.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.860
But why not tell it honestly?

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.660
It's more entertaining this way.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.980
And now, it has a before and after,
which, as you know, Americans love.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.460
People have to know.
He can't get away with this.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.540
Jamie does whatever he wants.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.100
This goes against everything he said
he admired in me.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.885
The whole principle of making a doc.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.660
Darby, you don't understand.
This is fraud. It's a big deal.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.540
People are jailed
for this kind of thing.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.940
I don't like to meddle with people.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.100
If they're gonna change, they'll change.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.611
Where is he?

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.848
He's at your father-in-law's tribute.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.060
Oh, shit! That was now!

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.970
And I returned the rental car.
I'm a mess.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.051
I can give you a jacket,
and you can take Jamie's Rollerblades.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.246
Thanks.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.500
You know, me and Jamie always wondered,
how are we gonna get old?

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.364
And the answer is...

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.362
Just like everyone else.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.580
- What is your name?
- Jamie Massey.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.524
Jamie Massey, okay.
Jamie Massey, everyone, Jamie Massey.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.769
Jeez Louise.
I've never been to a rat fuck like this.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.564
- Did you see Patti Smith?
- Where?

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.580
Can I get a Shirley Temple?

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.020
What're you doing, dude?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.860
- Can I stand here for a second?
- No.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.820
- What can I get you, sir?
- Shirley Temple.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.604
No problem. Right this way.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.340
Looking, listening.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.060
These are simple enough acts,
are they not?

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.562
We don't need any instruction
on how to use our eyes and ears.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.366
Or we don't think we do
until we see a Leslie Brietbart film.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.531
Yosh?

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.011
You okay?

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.164
My friend, Leslie Brietbart.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.540
I've been thinking of tonight
as my memorial for so long,

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.601
I had completely forgotten
that I actually had to be alive for it.

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.964
Is that my jacket?

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.686
Are those my blades?

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.682
Are they? Who knows?

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:16.082
Maybe they're Darby's.
Darby's, yours, mine.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.980
Cookie O'Puss.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.620
Where have you been?
Everyone's asking about you.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.609
I was in Poughkeepsie.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.126
Okay.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.091
It seems like you made
a whole lot of stuff up.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.860
Now, people have criticized me
and some of my colleagues,

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:36.205
saying that we were pretending
to be objective when there is no objectivity.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.531
Okay, we were trying to capture truth,

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.528
but the truth of experience...

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.646
I don't wanna miss his speech.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.300
You know,
it's your responsibility to be honest.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.606
People are gonna believe it.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.980
I didn't do anything nobody else does.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.780
"I didn't do anything nobody else..."

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.326
You reveal everything and nothing.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.140
You said you wanted
to be a real documentarian.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.460
I do.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.289
I thought you were about process.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.880
Process and ice cream.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.380
But you really will do
anything to be successful.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.289
Success isn't my thing, Josh.
It's yours.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.980
Yeah, you're right, it is my thing.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.460
I've got a fucked up relationship
with success.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.500
I want it and I don't have it.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.251
But what you have scares
the shit out of me.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.380
What we were trying to say as filmmakers

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:26.281
is that what we were filming
was more interesting than we were.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.366
We weren't trying to be objective.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.980
You're not uncomfortable at all.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.820
Why should I be uncomfortable?

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.580
See, that I just find weird.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.700
You're the only one
who is weird about this.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.140
I asked you to co-direct.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.810
Yeah, because you knew I'd say, "No!"

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.100
We were trying to be open

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.931
and to learn
from the people we were filming.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.620
Jeez, Joshy.
Everyone does this kind of thing.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.980
I don't. I don't do something like this.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.048
I'm trying to make movies
to figure out the truth.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.500
- Really?
- Yes!

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.922
We saw truth not through
telling you what we thought,

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.606
but through a different ethical approach
to filmmaking

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.180
that allowed the world
to reveal itself to us.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.460
I do know that documentaries are over.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.500
Are you kidding?
It's what everyone is doing.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.490
His documentaries are over.
What you're doing is something else.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.700
If everyone is filming everything,
what's a documentary anymore?

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.168
It has no meaning,
it's just some shit you recorded!

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.849
Is that old man talk? Maybe it is.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.170
You kids have been told
you can do anything.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.940
You think everything
is out there for you to have. It's not.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.060
Nobody owns anything. If I hear
a song I like, or a story, it's mine.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.580
It's mine to use. It's everybody's.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.660
No, it isn't! That's not sharing,
Jamie, that's stealing.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.366
- That's old man talk.
- I am an old man!

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.300
I can't let Cornelia
and Leslie walk down this road with you.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.007
I want you to go in there
and tell them what you've done.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.051
If you won't do it, I'll do it for you.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.531
Okay.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.569
What else can I tell you?

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.820
After all these years,
I still don't have all the answers.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.300
And for the sake of documentary cinema,

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.300
I intend to leave it that way.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.880
Thank you so much for this tribute.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.460
You know, it's just the way...

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.020
- Josh!
- Sorry I'm late, Leslie.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.260
I caught your speech
from the lobby, though,

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.580
and it was really inspiring, spot on.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.780
Are you okay, son?
Do you wanna sit down?

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:37.260
Jamie has something
he wants to tell all of you.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.300
Go ahead.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.180
Not all of the stuff in my movie
happened exactly as I said it did.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.940
I played around
with some of the timeline.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.041
Okay.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.326
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and...

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.487
And what?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.604
You did a lot more than that, come on.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.220
He didn't even know Kent. Darby did.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.380
Darby's mother died of ovarian cancer.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.562
Jamie's mom
is probably alive and kicking in Idaho.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.884
Josh, this is kind of my night.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.460
- You just need to hear this.
- That's basically it.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.940
That's not basically it! You knew
that Kent had tried to kill himself.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.140
- Right.
- Say it!

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.241
Josh, let him speak.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.889
The gist is the same.
I authored a bit of how I came to it.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.340
I mean, I'm not that good a writer.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.522
If I made it all up,
I'd be the best writer in Hollywood

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.688
and Kent would be Marlon Brando.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.100
I never said it was amazing.
I just said it was faked.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.500
And some of the timeline was adjusted...

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.980
Would you stop with the timeline crap?

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.060
Jamie knew
that Kent had tried to kill himself.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.660
That he'd been in Afghanistan.
We didn't just stumble upon it.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.820
It was rigged.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.020
Jamie invented the whole Facebook thing
because he knew it would play better.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.660
Kent wasn't in Afghanistan?

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.460
No, Kent was in Afghanistan.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.700
- So, what's the problem?
- It's...

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.500
It's the way... The way that he said
that he found him is not true.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.500
Kent served our country,
you're being offensive.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.060
Is what Josh is saying true?

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.300
Well, I did know, but I don't think
it really matters, though,

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.580
the movie's not about that.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.820
Of course it matters. Leslie, explain.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.340
I don't know
that it totally matters in this case.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.460
- What?
- I don't care.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.700
I didn't expect you to care.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.380
Leslie, are you kidding me?
You don't care?

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.740
You just gave a speech
about authenticity!

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.220
The movie works on so many levels,

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.980
the happenstance of it, to be honest
with you, is the least interesting part.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.286
I can't believe it!

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.060
This movie isn't worth
the RAM it's stored on.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.660
He's a con artist, Leslie.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.331
Your generation
of sit-ins and protesters

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.540
and pack rats
would be horrified by this demon!

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.660
Josh, you're hysterical.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.125
I'm not hysterical! I'm...

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.482
Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.300
Cornelia?

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.925
I don't know.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.571
I think he's an asshole,

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.740
but the movie's pretty good.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.808
And I'm sorry I think that.

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.540
This is so frustrating! This...

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.900
I'm going to get
no satisfaction here, am I?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.331
This guy's just gonna win
no matter what.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.140
This is not how the world works.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.020
Why does it have to be one thing
or another? Things change.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.531
Different things matter now.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.371
Okay, forget ethics then. What about me?

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.420
You played me.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.900
But you acted in it.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.526
Only because I thought it was real.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.325
I loved you.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.486
I really like you, too. We're friends.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.809
I really believed it.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.891
I was a bet.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.460
Are you okay, son?

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.767
I'm not crying. I'm not.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.881
Are you filming this?

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.964
Josh, your sleeve is on fire!

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.124
I took your note, by the way.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.322
I cut the stuff about Turkish politics.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.380
You were right, I don't need it.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.130
Glad to hear that, son.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.820
It doesn't matter that it was faked

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.340
because the movie
isn't about Afghanistan or Kent,

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.920
or anyone, it's all about Jamie.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:32.041
In my head, when I was blading over,
I swept in and exposed everything.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.568
I was such a hero.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.931
Thanks.

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.810
I wanted so badly...

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.882
I wanted to be admired.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.086
- I wanted a protégé.
- I know.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.249
He looked at me
like I was a real grown-up person.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.540
For the first time in my life,

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.009
I stopped thinking of myself
as a child imitating an adult.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.005
You feel that way, too?

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.767
I'm 44, and there are things
I will never do.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.488
Things I won't have.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.327
What's the opposite
of "the world is your oyster?"

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.482
I wish we could just go back
and meet each other all over again.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.380
I'd present myself differently,

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.925
so I didn't get your hopes up.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.687
I think it's hard for me
to have something great every day

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.525
and to acknowledge it.

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.567
I have something great every day.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.060
If we were different people,

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.289
I'd ask you to renew our vows.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.526
I think it's nice to renew vows.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.961
Maybe we are different people.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.540
Call when you get there!

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.660
We will, Fox.

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.762
You're gonna be such great parents.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.460
Hey, the guy is waving at us.
We gotta go, Marina!

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.607
They changed the rules.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.300
Bye, Willow!

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.820
We'll be back in a week.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.660
Fox, I'm gonna cry.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.220
The cop's coming, Marina. We gotta go.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.368
Send pictures of the little man.
We love you guys.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.140
- All right, bye.
- Love you, Fletcher!

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.483
I love you, too, but I'm not
getting arrested for you. Marina!

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.285
Thanks.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.047
- You really need 10?
- It's four hours to Port-au-Prince.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.340
I can't believe it.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.771
Me neither.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.610
Look who it is!

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.808
It's out there. The evil is unleashed.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.683
No, you were right, he's not evil.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.564
He's just young.
