We're almost ready
for you, Dr. Reid.

00:46.051 --> 00:47.251
Just a few questions.

00:47.319 --> 00:49.086
Are you having one of
your headaches right now?

00:49.154 --> 00:50.287
Yeah, I am.

00:50.355 --> 00:51.337
How long have you had it?

00:51.524 --> 00:53.792
Um...Not really
that long.

00:53.860 --> 00:54.860
I don't know.

00:54.927 --> 00:56.094
Can you be more specific?

00:56.162 --> 00:57.295
Uh, maybe 2 days.

00:57.793 --> 00:59.294
And the lights
hurt your eyes.

00:59.361 --> 01:00.795
Any hallucinations?

01:00.863 --> 01:02.130
No.

01:50.112 --> 01:51.028
Hey, you ok?

01:51.113 --> 01:52.280
Yeah. Why?

01:52.348 --> 01:53.548
You're never late.

01:53.616 --> 01:54.749
Have we started
the briefing yet?

01:54.817 --> 01:55.783
Just about to.

01:55.851 --> 01:57.352
Then I'm not late.

01:57.419 --> 01:58.353
Oh. Yeah.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.588
Attention, intrepid
BAU adventurers.

02:00.656 --> 02:02.891
The land of Bermuda shorts,
white leisure suits,

02:02.958 --> 02:04.792
and sansabelt slacks
requests your presence.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.227
- Arizona.
- Vegas?

02:06.295 --> 02:07.729
- Please.
- Palm Springs.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.564
I was going to say Miami,
but point well made

02:09.632 --> 02:11.065
about the dizzying
number of locales

02:11.133 --> 02:12.901
with unfortunate
fashion tendencies.

02:12.968 --> 02:14.035
Here we go.

02:14.103 --> 02:15.670
Shells in the eyes
and mouth.

02:15.738 --> 02:16.905
You don't see that
every day.

02:16.972 --> 02:18.573
Not even in Miami.

02:18.641 --> 02:20.975
3 victims, the last one
found with a...

02:21.043 --> 02:21.910
A decapitated cat?

02:21.977 --> 02:23.411
All were found
within a mile

02:23.479 --> 02:25.780
of each other in a mostly
Latino neighborhood in Miami

02:25.848 --> 02:27.248
called Allapattah.

02:27.316 --> 02:30.418
Eduardo Guzman, homeless.
He was shot to death 7 days ago.

02:30.486 --> 02:32.687
Yanira Espinal, prostitute,

02:32.755 --> 02:34.088
bludgeoned to death
3 days ago.

02:34.156 --> 02:37.091
And then Victor Cabrera,
he was an unemployed janitor.

02:37.159 --> 02:39.294
He was slashed
with a machete yesterday,

02:39.361 --> 02:41.129
as was his cat.

02:41.196 --> 02:43.865
You know, considering the
homeless man lived in that alley,

02:43.933 --> 02:46.734
all of the victims essentially
were killed in their homes.

02:46.802 --> 02:48.069
This took some time.

02:48.137 --> 02:49.103
In the open.

02:49.171 --> 02:50.471
You know, cowrie shells

02:50.539 --> 02:52.240
and ritual offerings
are common to a number

02:52.308 --> 02:53.775
of Afro-Caribbean religions.

02:53.842 --> 02:55.610
But the upside-down cross
looks like satanism.

02:55.678 --> 02:57.712
The first two victims
had fingers missing,

02:57.780 --> 02:59.781
but on this one,
he took both hands.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.282
All of this
could have been religious?

03:01.350 --> 03:02.951
This could have specific
religious meaning

03:03.018 --> 03:04.886
or it could just be part
of the unsub's signature.

03:04.954 --> 03:07.155
Either way, his
timetable's accelerating.

03:07.222 --> 03:08.890
We have a day, maybe 2,
before the Miami P.D.

03:08.958 --> 03:10.458
Has another body
on its hands.

03:28.157 --> 03:50.075
?

03:54.720 --> 03:57.587
"No man chooses evil
because it is evil.

03:57.633 --> 04:01.469
He only mistakes it for
happiness, the good he seeks."

04:01.537 --> 04:03.738
Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.

04:03.806 --> 04:05.239
The first victim was frail
and an easy target,

04:05.307 --> 04:08.976
and yet the unsub shot him
from behind and at a distance.

04:09.044 --> 04:10.311
By the second victim,
the unsub chose

04:10.379 --> 04:11.646
not to use
a gun anymore.

04:11.714 --> 04:13.848
He got up close and personal.

04:13.916 --> 04:15.149
4 days is a rapid
increase in confidence.

04:15.217 --> 04:16.983
By the third victim,
he was comfortable enough

04:17.052 --> 04:18.152
to use a machete.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.954
But still from behind.

04:20.022 --> 04:22.256
So he's not invested
in watch his victims suffer.

04:22.324 --> 04:23.391
Which fits what the M.E. said

04:23.459 --> 04:24.826
about the mutilations
being postmortem.

04:24.893 --> 04:26.794
So we're back around
a religious ritual.

04:26.862 --> 04:28.262
Reid?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.297
Hmm?

04:29.365 --> 04:31.566
Anything helpful?

04:31.633 --> 04:34.001
Yeah. Yeah.

04:34.069 --> 04:35.470
Um...

04:36.638 --> 04:39.774
The Afro-Caribbean
syncretic religions began

04:39.842 --> 04:41.476
with slaves, who mixed
their traditional religions

04:41.543 --> 04:45.179
with Catholicism in order to
camouflage them.

04:45.247 --> 04:48.182
The elements
in this altar...

04:48.250 --> 04:50.618
Look to me like Santeria.

04:50.686 --> 04:52.420
It's a yoruban-based religion

04:52.488 --> 04:54.522
developed in Cuba.
Practitioners

04:54.590 --> 04:56.457
worship orishas, deities
that roughly correspond

04:56.525 --> 04:57.625
with Catholic saints.

04:57.693 --> 05:00.094
And what about the shells?

05:00.162 --> 05:02.130
Let's see. This is Ellegua,

05:02.197 --> 05:03.631
the deity of the crossroads,

05:03.699 --> 05:06.234
a trickster and the impartial
enforcer of justice.

05:06.301 --> 05:09.237
So, is the unsub sacrificing
the victims to him?

05:09.304 --> 05:11.472
None of these religions
openly call for human sacrifice,

05:11.540 --> 05:12.640
only animals.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.742
We need to determine
whether these killings

05:14.810 --> 05:16.544
are part of
an existing ritual.

05:16.612 --> 05:18.146
Or whether he's using religion

05:18.213 --> 05:19.647
to cover his own
psychopathology.

05:19.715 --> 05:21.816
The last victim used to frequent
a local community center.

05:21.884 --> 05:23.317
It might be a good way
to get some background.

05:23.385 --> 05:25.253
Good. Take Reid with you.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.054
Prentiss and I will go
to the last crime scene.

05:27.122 --> 05:29.724
Dave and Seaver,
get set up with the P.D.

05:33.896 --> 05:35.029
This the line?

05:35.097 --> 05:36.431
Hmm?

05:36.498 --> 05:37.732
Uh, for coffee. Sorry.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.168
Oh, no. No,
I'm just thinking.

05:40.235 --> 05:42.003
Aren't you always?

05:42.070 --> 05:44.672
Yeah.

05:44.740 --> 05:46.941
Hey, what's the weather
like in Miami right now?

05:47.009 --> 05:50.478
I don't know exactly,
but my guess--75 and sunny.

06:03.992 --> 06:05.927
Hey, what's the matter
with you?

06:05.994 --> 06:07.929
You're not gonna give me
a bunch of facts

06:07.996 --> 06:10.097
about the area
and the demographics?

06:10.165 --> 06:11.799
The Allapattah neighborhood
is named after

06:11.867 --> 06:13.768
the native American word
for alligator.

06:13.836 --> 06:15.703
There you go.
There's the kid I know.

06:15.771 --> 06:19.207
All right,
5372 Seminole Street.

06:19.274 --> 06:20.842
This can't be it.

06:23.178 --> 06:24.312
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know where

06:24.379 --> 06:26.147
the community center is?

06:26.215 --> 06:27.715
It's down there.

06:27.783 --> 06:28.916
This is Seminole Alley.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.759
Reid, you all right?

06:38.827 --> 06:40.261
Yeah. I'm fine.

06:40.329 --> 06:42.296
A lot better
than that goat.

06:42.364 --> 06:44.665
Yeah, you got that right.

06:47.336 --> 06:50.171
You see a lot of animal
sacrifices, Detective?

06:50.239 --> 06:51.239
Roosters,

06:51.306 --> 06:52.807
goats, even possums,
but, uh,

06:52.875 --> 06:54.442
a cat is new to me.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.111
He turned the victim's
crucifix upside down.

06:57.179 --> 06:59.847
Well, he brought the shells
and the murder weapon with him.

06:59.915 --> 07:01.782
He must have brought
gloves, too.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.018
The only fingerprints they
found belonged to the victim.

07:04.086 --> 07:05.620
Older, organized.

07:05.687 --> 07:07.588
Yeah, except
he left a footprint.

07:07.656 --> 07:11.158
That's something only
an inexperienced unsub would do.

07:11.226 --> 07:13.361
It's almost as though he planned
this whole thing very carefully,

07:13.428 --> 07:17.265
but then reality was nothing
like his imagination.

07:17.332 --> 07:19.033
That throws him off balance
and he makes a mistake.

07:19.101 --> 07:20.601
But he is getting used to it.

07:20.669 --> 07:23.771
Each kill is more precise
and well-executed.

07:23.839 --> 07:26.274
The first killing, he had
to saw to take the finger off.

07:26.341 --> 07:28.643
He made sure he brought something
sharp enough this time.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.878
Right. He knows what he needs
to bring with him

07:30.946 --> 07:32.346
and what's already here.

07:32.414 --> 07:33.814
He's been here before.

07:33.882 --> 07:35.616
There's no signs
of forced entry.

07:35.684 --> 07:38.052
The victim let him in.

07:42.558 --> 07:44.525
These chalk designs
on the floor--

07:44.593 --> 07:47.161
they were made before
the blood spatter,

07:47.229 --> 07:48.629
and they're not smudged
at all.

07:48.697 --> 07:50.031
And no sign of a struggle.

07:50.098 --> 07:53.000
Maybe the victim chose
to be part of the ritual.

07:53.068 --> 07:55.703
After the murder, the unsub
turned the victim's body over.

07:55.771 --> 07:59.040
His face was clean,
so he wiped the blood off.

07:59.107 --> 08:00.207
Remorse?

08:00.275 --> 08:01.776
Or he feels conflicted
about harming the victims.

08:01.843 --> 08:04.178
They may represent
somebody to him.

08:04.246 --> 08:05.947
These shells--

08:06.014 --> 08:07.949
they look like
"see no evil, speak no evil."

08:08.016 --> 08:10.284
He's symbolically
silencing his victims

08:10.352 --> 08:12.053
so they can't tell anyone
about him.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.122
By posing the bodies,
he is sending a message.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.391
He may not want the victims
to see or hear him,

08:17.459 --> 08:19.226
but he wants somebody to.

08:23.398 --> 08:26.367
Victor was
my best friend.

08:26.435 --> 08:27.702
We were like brothers.

08:27.769 --> 08:29.904
We're sorry for your loss,
Mr. Mercado.

08:29.972 --> 08:32.673
He was sick for a long time,

08:32.741 --> 08:34.207
but he was finally
feeling better.

08:34.275 --> 08:36.210
He was sick?

08:36.278 --> 08:38.813
His men's part, down there.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.749
The cancer.

08:41.817 --> 08:43.049
Where was he being
treated?

08:43.118 --> 08:44.719
No, no, no. No doctors.

08:44.786 --> 08:47.822
They don't do nothing
but make you worse.

08:47.889 --> 08:50.891
Throw radiation on you,
poison you.

08:50.959 --> 08:52.393
He did his cleaning
every day.

08:52.461 --> 08:54.362
That's why
he was feeling better.

08:54.429 --> 08:55.529
What do you mean
by cleaning?

08:55.597 --> 08:57.465
He clean his head,
his body.

08:57.532 --> 09:01.102
But he got one of
the saints mad.

09:01.169 --> 09:04.772
Maybe he forgot
to feed Ellegua.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.641
¿Terminaste?

09:06.708 --> 09:08.142
Si.

09:12.514 --> 09:13.814
Tuti.

09:15.817 --> 09:18.052
I must go.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.560
Excuse me.

09:26.628 --> 09:28.429
You run this place?

09:28.497 --> 09:30.297
I don't talk to cops,

09:30.365 --> 09:32.733
unless you got a warrant.

09:43.612 --> 09:45.312
Well, one thing's for sure
is this community

09:45.380 --> 09:47.148
does not trust
outsiders.

09:47.215 --> 09:48.482
They barely trust insiders.

09:48.550 --> 09:49.984
And none of the residents
are gonna want to tell us

09:50.052 --> 09:51.318
what's ritual and what isn't.

09:51.386 --> 09:52.553
Garcia?

09:53.722 --> 09:55.122
Hey, Garcia.

09:55.190 --> 09:57.825
Where you at?

09:57.893 --> 09:59.960
I'm...

10:00.028 --> 10:02.096
I'm here. I'm right--
I'm right--I'm right here.

10:02.164 --> 10:03.464
I'm always right here.

10:03.532 --> 10:05.166
All right, listen, we need
you to find us and expert

10:05.233 --> 10:08.002
on Afro-Caribbean religions,
someone outside of the community

10:08.070 --> 10:09.370
who might be willing to talk.

10:09.438 --> 10:11.839
If he or she exists, yours
truly will find him or her.

10:11.907 --> 10:13.307
Yes.
Thanks, Garcia.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.710
So not only do all the victims
know the unsub,

10:15.777 --> 10:17.845
but they participate with
him in a consensual ritual

10:17.913 --> 10:19.213
before he kills them.

10:19.281 --> 10:21.348
He poses the bodies after death.

10:21.416 --> 10:22.850
He wants them to be found.

10:22.918 --> 10:25.386
The question is, who is he
trying to communicate with?

10:25.454 --> 10:27.054
And what's he trying to say?

11:57.913 --> 11:59.213
Aah!

12:09.000 --> 12:10.240
The Professor has
a morning class,

12:10.302 --> 12:12.069
but he'll be with you
shortly.

12:12.137 --> 12:13.270
Thank you.

12:15.540 --> 12:19.176
I've never seen a first
edition "Tractatus" before.

12:21.980 --> 12:22.913
Yeah, Hotch.

12:22.981 --> 12:24.048
We got another one.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.549
Well, that didn't take long.

12:25.617 --> 12:27.885
Jimmy Mercado, friend
of the last victim.

12:27.953 --> 12:28.986
Jimmy Mercado?

12:29.054 --> 12:30.754
Wait a minute.
Reid, isn't Jimmy Mercado

12:30.822 --> 12:32.089
yeah.
The shaved ice man?

12:32.157 --> 12:34.425
Hotch, we just interviewed
this guy yesterday.

12:34.493 --> 12:37.194
All right, so anyone talking
to us could be at risk.

12:37.262 --> 12:38.929
We'll send photos.

12:39.931 --> 12:41.665
Mercado was killed?

12:41.733 --> 12:43.734
Psychopathic hubris.

12:43.802 --> 12:47.438
This unsub's success
is making him feel invincible.

12:47.506 --> 12:50.040
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

12:50.108 --> 12:53.043
The lady that called said you're
investigating these murders

12:53.111 --> 12:55.179
we've been seeing on TV.

12:55.247 --> 12:56.380
Awful. Just awful.

12:56.448 --> 12:58.883
So, how can I be
of assistance?

12:58.950 --> 13:02.419
We were hoping you could
help us analyze these.

13:04.623 --> 13:08.092
They're difficult to look at
even when you're used to them.

13:12.230 --> 13:14.098
Well...

13:14.166 --> 13:17.668
You have several different
religions manifesting here.

13:17.736 --> 13:20.971
Most of the elements are from
Santeria healing rituals,

13:21.039 --> 13:23.807
but the upside-down crucifix
and the chalk drawings--

13:23.875 --> 13:26.043
they're from
a much darker religion.

13:26.111 --> 13:28.979
Unbaptized Palo Mayombe.

13:34.319 --> 13:36.987
This is a significant change
in the unsub's M.O.

13:37.055 --> 13:39.256
He subdued the victim
in the hallway

13:39.324 --> 13:40.858
prior to dragging him
in here.

13:40.926 --> 13:42.459
It doesn't suggest
a consensual ritual.

13:42.527 --> 13:44.662
He wanted the victim to know
exactly what was coming.

13:44.729 --> 13:47.731
And he took the head
as well as the hands.

13:47.799 --> 13:49.200
Not exactly.

13:50.502 --> 13:52.970
He took the brain.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.840
And what is that?

13:57.909 --> 13:59.076
His tongue.

13:59.144 --> 14:01.078
Just when you think
it can't get any worse.

14:01.146 --> 14:02.646
And that?

14:09.187 --> 14:10.221
Is that a dog?

14:10.288 --> 14:11.889
He had a chihuahua.

14:11.957 --> 14:13.924
Does that mean anything
to you, Professor?

14:13.992 --> 14:15.826
Santeros don't sacrifice
house pets,

14:15.894 --> 14:20.064
but there are Palo Mayombe
rituals that use dogs.

14:20.131 --> 14:23.033
Palo is a secretive religion.

14:23.101 --> 14:24.835
Very hard to research.

14:24.903 --> 14:27.972
Mine will be the first
academic work on the subject.

14:28.039 --> 14:30.341
Earlier you called it dark,

14:30.408 --> 14:32.509
but aren't all the African-based
syncretic religions amoral?

14:32.577 --> 14:33.744
I mean, it can be used
for good or evil

14:33.812 --> 14:35.212
depending on
the practitioner, right?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.481
They're nature religions.

14:37.549 --> 14:39.250
Nature knows no right or wrong,

14:39.317 --> 14:41.385
only balance or imbalance.

14:41.453 --> 14:44.088
So what makes Palo darker
than other religions?

14:44.155 --> 14:47.258
All the others achieve their
goals by pleasing the orishas.

14:47.325 --> 14:51.328
Palo is the only one that
harnesses the spirits of the dead

14:51.396 --> 14:52.763
to accomplish its ends.

14:53.765 --> 14:57.301
This is an Nganga,

14:57.369 --> 14:59.703
the primary tool of a Palero,
a Palo priest.

14:59.771 --> 15:03.040
Now, at its core
is the Nkisi,

15:03.108 --> 15:06.010
the spirit of the deceased
who inhabits it.

15:06.077 --> 15:11.348
Many Paleros believe that the
fresher the brain in the skull,

15:11.416 --> 15:13.417
the more powerful
the Nganga is.

15:13.485 --> 15:16.353
So what are you saying, this
actually calls for a human sacrifice?

15:16.421 --> 15:18.188
No, no, no, not at all.
Usually a fresh brain

15:18.256 --> 15:19.690
means digging up
a recent grave

15:19.758 --> 15:21.558
or getting one
through donation.

15:21.626 --> 15:23.661
I've never heard of a Palero
killing to obtain one.

15:23.728 --> 15:27.398
Well, this may be a first.

15:27.465 --> 15:29.266
Does anything look
out of place to you?

15:29.334 --> 15:33.404
Outside of the human head,
it all seems fairly traditional.

15:34.472 --> 15:37.107
Well, he cut off
the victim's tongue

15:37.175 --> 15:39.510
and put it in a dish.

15:39.577 --> 15:41.412
Does that have some kind
of ritual meaning?

15:41.479 --> 15:44.415
It may be a sacrifice to
Ellegua to silence informants,

15:44.482 --> 15:47.351
people who talk to outsiders, but
usually you use a cow tongue.

15:47.419 --> 15:49.186
Let me ask you this.
All of the victims

15:49.254 --> 15:51.422
either had hands
or fingers removed.

15:51.489 --> 15:53.791
That's not good.

15:53.858 --> 15:56.593
He maybe be building
an Nganga to Kadiembempe,

15:56.661 --> 15:58.629
the deity that some call
the devil.

15:58.697 --> 16:02.099
It requires finger bones
from 7 different corpses.

16:04.035 --> 16:06.937
So far, he only has 4.

16:07.005 --> 16:08.872
We believe that our
unsub is a lone male.

16:08.940 --> 16:11.475
There is no evidence to suggest
more than one individual

16:11.543 --> 16:12.710
at any of
the crime scenes.

16:12.777 --> 16:16.547
He is behaviorally young,
probably between 17 and 22.

16:16.614 --> 16:18.048
Behaviorally?

16:18.116 --> 16:20.050
If he spent time in jail
or been institutionalized,

16:20.118 --> 16:21.552
he could be
chronologically older.

16:21.619 --> 16:23.620
Those lost years
retard behavioral age.

16:23.688 --> 16:25.723
He's part of
the community,

16:25.790 --> 16:27.558
most likely
Hispanic or black.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.793
We believe that he uses some
sort of religious connection

16:29.861 --> 16:31.128
to get close
to his victims.

16:31.196 --> 16:34.231
Either Santeria
or Palo Mayombe.

16:34.299 --> 16:37.434
Obviously this is a very sensitive
issue within the community.

16:37.502 --> 16:41.739
He may be a practitioner whom people
trust and rely on for healing.

16:41.806 --> 16:44.141
Instead, he uses their
vulnerability to prey on them.

16:44.209 --> 16:46.443
He's highly organized
in his planning,

16:46.511 --> 16:48.445
but then impulsive
in his execution.

16:48.513 --> 16:51.682
Indicating that his emotions
take over once he gets started.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.450
This tell us that while
he may think

16:53.518 --> 16:55.652
that he has an objective
reason for the killings,

16:55.720 --> 16:57.821
he actually has a compulsion which
is the real reason behind them.

16:57.889 --> 17:01.959
And this has resulted in a rapid
escalation of his M.O. and his timeframe.

17:02.026 --> 17:04.928
He's become more efficient
and more violent.

17:04.996 --> 17:07.464
This makes him unpredictable
and even more dangerous.

17:07.531 --> 17:10.200
He focuses on victims who
are fragile and vulnerable

17:10.268 --> 17:12.502
and then creates
relationships with them.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.605
You need to look for someone
who has close access

17:14.672 --> 17:16.039
To people in need.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.375
He may work in a government aid
office or a community center.

17:18.443 --> 17:20.544
Talk to me, Garcia.
His coworkers will describe him...

17:20.612 --> 17:22.613
Girl genius does it again.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.680
According to the sign-in logs,

17:23.748 --> 17:25.182
all of the victims were patrons

17:25.250 --> 17:27.384
at that soup kitchen
you visited yesterday. Huh?

17:27.452 --> 17:28.886
You know I love you, right?

17:28.953 --> 17:30.154
What's not to love?

17:30.221 --> 17:31.388
Bye.

17:31.456 --> 17:33.390
He will have become
moody and preoccupied,

17:33.458 --> 17:35.492
maybe even exhibited
flashes of temper.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.127
Because of the age
of his victims,

17:37.195 --> 17:39.062
we believe he may have
been abused as a child

17:39.130 --> 17:41.131
and is taking revenge
on parental figures.

17:41.199 --> 17:43.901
Look for someone who's been
in the juvenile system

17:43.968 --> 17:45.669
or in foster care.
Thank you.

18:09.694 --> 18:10.727
Laroye!

18:11.896 --> 18:12.830
Laroye!

18:16.468 --> 18:18.202
Laroye.

18:19.337 --> 18:22.105
Laroye.

18:22.173 --> 18:24.741
Laroye.

18:24.809 --> 18:27.110
Laroye.

18:27.178 --> 18:28.278
Laroye!

18:28.346 --> 18:31.048
Aah!

18:43.461 --> 18:45.863
We're with the FBI.
We're not here to cause any trouble.

18:45.930 --> 18:48.232
But, sir, please
put that knife down.

18:54.973 --> 18:56.840
This is a House of God.

18:56.908 --> 18:58.709
You have no right
to be here.

18:58.776 --> 19:01.778
We just would like
to ask you some questions.

19:01.846 --> 19:03.814
We'd appreciate it
if you came with us voluntarily.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.883
We're not here to create
a spectacle.

19:07.886 --> 19:10.854
I will go with you.

19:16.761 --> 19:17.694
Laroye!

19:52.130 --> 19:54.865
Ok, your bad boy
grew up in foster care.

19:54.933 --> 19:57.401
He did 15 years
in Apalachee Correctional

19:57.468 --> 19:59.536
for attempting to murder
a police officer.

19:59.604 --> 20:02.139
He was also a member
of a violent street gang

20:02.206 --> 20:03.607
known as Los Machetes.

20:03.675 --> 20:04.608
Subtle.

20:04.676 --> 20:06.243
Damn.

20:06.311 --> 20:08.078
They like to
cut off the hands

20:08.146 --> 20:09.913
and sometime the heads
of their victims.

20:09.981 --> 20:12.115
Can you get us some crime
scene photos to look at?

20:12.183 --> 20:13.550
I'll get someone on it.

20:14.619 --> 20:16.019
Anything else, Garcia?

20:16.087 --> 20:19.189
I can tell you that Julio
did his time without incident.

20:19.257 --> 20:23.860
He was released in 2003.
He regularly visited his parole officer.

20:23.928 --> 20:25.729
There are no waves
in these crime waters

20:25.797 --> 20:26.897
since he got out.

20:26.965 --> 20:28.565
All right,
thanks, baby girl.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.567
I shall await further
instruction.

20:32.136 --> 20:35.172
This guy's been eyeballing
the mirror since he got here.

20:35.239 --> 20:36.607
Let's see what he has to say.

20:36.674 --> 20:38.508
Wait, Morgan. I think maybe
I should go in first.

20:38.576 --> 20:39.643
What?

20:39.711 --> 20:40.944
Do you remember
at the community center,

20:41.012 --> 20:42.179
he said he would
come with me?

20:42.246 --> 20:44.815
If they already
have a rapport...

20:44.882 --> 20:46.483
You want Morgan
to come with you?

20:46.551 --> 20:47.985
No, I'm all right.
Thanks.

20:50.088 --> 20:53.323
Dave, you want to go to the soup kitchen
and check out his living space,

20:53.391 --> 20:55.092
take Prentiss
and Seaver with you?

20:55.159 --> 20:57.227
There was a teenager.
Looked like his assistant.

20:57.295 --> 20:59.096
He took over when we left.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.908
My name is Dr. Spencer Reid.

21:19.617 --> 21:21.985
Did you know these people?

21:23.154 --> 21:25.255
They are my godchildren.

21:25.323 --> 21:27.924
They all came to me
to be healed.

21:27.992 --> 21:30.427
And you healed them.

21:30.495 --> 21:32.496
You think I killed them.

21:34.298 --> 21:36.566
The saints don't need
a human sacrifice.

21:36.634 --> 21:38.235
That is a man's sickness.

21:38.302 --> 21:40.437
Maybe it's not
about sacrifice.

21:40.505 --> 21:44.307
Maybe someone needs body
parts to build a Nganga.

21:44.375 --> 21:47.444
What do you know
about Palo?

21:53.151 --> 21:56.086
This light...Is no good.

21:56.154 --> 21:57.888
It gives you a headache.

22:35.693 --> 22:38.962
That's got prison corners.

22:39.030 --> 22:41.598
15 years inside
makes an impression.

22:41.666 --> 22:43.100
Is that blood?

22:47.839 --> 22:51.875
You wanted to see some
of what Los Machetes does?

23:11.262 --> 23:13.697
That remind you
of your youth?

23:14.899 --> 23:18.034
It's some pretty ugly
things to be involved in.

23:18.102 --> 23:20.971
Did you help,
or did you just watch?

23:27.812 --> 23:29.479
It looks like
a kid lives here.

23:29.547 --> 23:33.383
Morgan said that Julio
had an assistant

23:33.451 --> 23:34.851
during the ritual.

23:34.919 --> 23:36.653
A teenager.

23:36.721 --> 23:38.855
Look. More blood.

23:38.923 --> 23:42.559
It looks like the kid
had a side business.

23:42.627 --> 23:43.693
Smack.

23:43.761 --> 23:47.597
Is that what
you call religion?

23:47.665 --> 23:49.866
What kind of man
does that to another man?

23:49.934 --> 23:52.335
Not a man of faith.

23:53.571 --> 23:55.939
And interesting hobbies.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.394
Eggun buruku ni

24:17.461 --> 24:19.029
ki ori baje ni

24:19.096 --> 24:21.031
iche paraldo tete tete!

25:04.404 --> 25:05.504
What the hell
was that?

25:05.572 --> 25:07.306
I think I just witnessed
a classic case

25:07.374 --> 25:08.407
of transpossession.

25:08.475 --> 25:10.209
It's a form of
religious hysteria.

25:10.277 --> 25:13.379
He wholeheartedly believes he was
being occupied by some form of deity.

25:13.447 --> 25:14.547
He wasn't faking it?

25:14.614 --> 25:17.216
Up close you can see
physiological signs.

25:17.284 --> 25:19.351
His body actually changed
in response to the belief.

25:19.419 --> 25:20.786
There have been a lot of
studies of this phenomenon.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.288
There was one case where
an 80-year-old woman

25:22.355 --> 25:23.589
was able to lift a grown man
above her head

25:23.657 --> 25:25.491
when she believed she was
occupied by her Saint.

25:25.559 --> 25:27.727
Detective, did you understand
what he was saying at the end?

25:27.794 --> 25:30.696
Brother, look, I'm a
Puerto Rican Catholic

25:30.764 --> 25:32.131
that grew up
in Orlando.

25:32.199 --> 25:34.200
That wasn't any language
I ever heard.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.135
I remember the words.
I'm sure he'll be able to translate them.

25:36.203 --> 25:37.503
That I remember them?
You sure?

25:37.571 --> 25:39.071
That you want
to go back in.

25:39.139 --> 25:40.239
Yeah.

25:41.742 --> 25:43.142
Is he all right?

25:43.210 --> 25:44.844
Yeah, I think so.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.113
But something weird was
definitely going on in there.

25:56.189 --> 25:57.256
What happened?

25:57.324 --> 25:58.924
You have no recollection?

25:58.992 --> 26:00.693
I remember talking
about the lights.

26:00.761 --> 26:02.094
You were talking
about lights,

26:02.162 --> 26:03.729
and then you were
talking about headaches.

26:03.797 --> 26:06.165
That was my Saint.

26:06.233 --> 26:08.834
You're lucky Ellegua spoke to you.
What did he say?

26:08.902 --> 26:12.671
Eggun buruku
ni ki ori baje ni.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.209
You have bad eggun
on top of you

26:17.277 --> 26:19.111
that's spoiling your head.

26:19.179 --> 26:21.714
Iche peraldo tete tete.

26:21.782 --> 26:24.316
Do a cleansing quickly.

26:25.385 --> 26:27.253
What are eggun?

26:27.320 --> 26:29.054
Spirits of the dead.

26:29.122 --> 26:30.556
I didn't.
Why would you say that I--

26:30.624 --> 26:32.758
well, why would
your Saint say

26:32.826 --> 26:34.426
that they're
spoiling my head?

26:34.494 --> 26:37.830
Now, that's a question
only you can answer.

26:42.169 --> 26:44.637
Something's wrong.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.238
Can you feel it?

26:46.306 --> 26:47.573
Yeah. 4 people are dead.

26:47.641 --> 26:49.775
I think maybe the fifth one
is safe with you in here.

26:49.843 --> 26:50.943
No, he's not.

26:51.011 --> 26:53.145
Someone's about to get hurt.

26:53.213 --> 26:56.415
Listen with your heart,
not your head.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.321
Your helper, the kid
that took over your ritual

27:02.389 --> 27:03.756
Elian.
When we brought you in here?

27:03.824 --> 27:06.525
My associates just found
sale-weight heroin in his room.

27:06.593 --> 27:07.760
And an Nganga.

27:07.828 --> 27:09.628
Where is he?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.063
He's running.

27:13.433 --> 27:15.768
Hey. Calm down.

27:15.836 --> 27:17.670
That was genuine.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.971
You sound surprised.

27:19.039 --> 27:21.106
And he cares
about the kid.

27:21.174 --> 27:22.274
Well, he's no psychopath.

27:22.342 --> 27:23.275
No, but maybe the boy is.

27:23.343 --> 27:24.810
Do we have a last name
for Elian?

27:24.878 --> 27:26.045
Morales.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.980
Prentiss, have Garcia
find out what she can.

27:28.048 --> 27:29.515
Please, I gotta find him.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.450
He's got nobody but me.

27:31.518 --> 27:34.587
Do you think it's possible
that Elian is our Palero?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.889
No. No, he's a good kid.

27:36.957 --> 27:37.957
Then why did he run?

27:38.024 --> 27:39.191
He must be using again.

27:39.259 --> 27:41.760
His mama and papa
were junkies.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.295
I took him in,
got him clean,

27:43.363 --> 27:44.530
taught him right from wrong.

27:44.598 --> 27:47.833
Please. I gotta find him
before he gets hurt.

27:47.901 --> 27:50.102
The entire police force
is out looking for him.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.171
He's of the streets.

27:53.673 --> 27:56.275
He's gonna go so far under,
he'll be gone for good.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.944
I'm your best chance
to find him.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.346
Just small stuff--

28:00.413 --> 28:01.680
shoplifting, loitering--

28:01.748 --> 28:03.048
wait.

28:03.116 --> 28:06.952
Uh, he was thrown
in juvie hall for assault

28:07.020 --> 28:08.220
last month.

28:08.288 --> 28:10.022
Complainant was Julio Ruiz.

28:10.090 --> 28:11.824
Tough love?

28:11.892 --> 28:14.693
Charges were dropped.
Elian got out last week.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.195
Which is when
the murders started.

28:16.263 --> 28:17.263
Thanks, Garcia.

28:17.330 --> 28:18.264
Yeah.

28:18.331 --> 28:19.531
Elian's dependent on him,

28:19.599 --> 28:21.600
so he can't get revenge
directly.

28:21.668 --> 28:23.903
His rage against
Julio and his junkie parents

28:23.970 --> 28:26.438
could be taken out
on the victims.

28:26.506 --> 28:29.408
So, uh, the blood
on the head thing is goat.

28:29.476 --> 28:31.577
But the pot that the kid
had has 4 human fingers

28:31.645 --> 28:33.245
and parts of
a human brain in it.

28:33.313 --> 28:36.949
And it's human blood on the sneaker.
And one more thing--

28:37.017 --> 28:39.285
the tongue and the hands
were cut off antemortem.

28:39.352 --> 28:40.920
The guy's torturing them now.

28:47.594 --> 28:49.261
You know, you can't
protect him if he did this.

28:49.329 --> 28:51.030
I'm not protecting him.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.465
Then what are you
not telling us?

28:54.868 --> 28:56.869
If you want to help Elian,

28:56.937 --> 29:00.105
you're gonna have to give us
something that we don't know.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.812
I'll ask the orishas
to help find this killer.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.188
We don't have
time for this, do we?

29:16.256 --> 29:18.624
If he ends with him
helping us, yes, we do.

29:31.705 --> 29:33.305
The orishas are with us now.

29:33.373 --> 29:37.409
Ok, we have 4 victims, all with cowrie
shells in their mouths and eyes.

29:37.477 --> 29:41.613
Eleggua is called
to find justice.

29:41.681 --> 29:43.449
Two of the victims
had fingers cut off.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.551
One had both hands removed.

29:45.618 --> 29:49.421
And one had its head left on the
scene, but the brain was missing.

29:49.489 --> 29:51.590
They took the brain
and left the head?

29:51.658 --> 29:53.325
The head was left
at the crime scene.

29:53.393 --> 29:55.461
No, that is not Palo.

29:55.528 --> 29:57.863
A Palero would not
leave the head.

29:59.866 --> 30:03.469
He also left the tongue.

30:03.536 --> 30:04.803
There is no use
in the religion

30:04.871 --> 30:06.839
for a tongue that is
not pierced with needles.

30:06.906 --> 30:11.143
It means nothing just to
put a tongue in a dish.

30:11.211 --> 30:12.811
If it's not part
of the ritual,

30:12.879 --> 30:14.279
then it's the unsub's
signature.

30:14.347 --> 30:16.215
His psychopathy is showing.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.218
So he's silencing someone
through his victims.

30:19.285 --> 30:22.287
And he enjoys it.
He just didn't know it at first.

30:22.355 --> 30:25.324
Elian is an angry child,

30:25.392 --> 30:27.326
but he would not do this.

30:27.394 --> 30:32.297
Please, let me find him
before it gets worse.

30:37.303 --> 30:40.105
Thank you for your help.

30:47.781 --> 30:50.716
Your head is spinning
because it's full of ghosts.

30:50.784 --> 30:53.552
You think you can do this work
day in, day out

30:53.620 --> 30:55.888
and you don't carry it
with you?

30:55.955 --> 30:58.791
It's eating your soul.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.662
Ghosts?

31:03.730 --> 31:05.464
All right,
so what have we got?

31:05.532 --> 31:07.499
A lot of evidence
pointing to Elian Morales.

31:07.567 --> 31:08.967
Too much.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.636
He fits the profile
perfectly.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.971
Too perfectly.
Like every step was planned.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.740
There are no fingerprints,
but a single sneaker print.

31:14.808 --> 31:17.409
And that sneaker turns up
in the kid's room.

31:17.477 --> 31:19.044
Maybe somebody's framing
Elian, but who?

31:19.112 --> 31:20.479
Someone with enough
intelligence and control

31:20.547 --> 31:22.147
to set up a very
convincing trail.

31:22.215 --> 31:23.482
Somebody we've met.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.584
He's probably been
watching us all along.

31:25.652 --> 31:27.986
He began his killing
for gain of some sort.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.056
But his enjoyment of killing is
beginning to disrupt his organization.

31:31.124 --> 31:33.258
He's demanding attention.
Maybe that's his game.

31:33.326 --> 31:36.261
Well, he got it.
From the media, from the public, us.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.297
That's it--media attention.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.965
But not for the killings,
for the religion.

31:40.033 --> 31:42.501
Morgan, Professor Walker is about
to public a book on Palo Mayombe.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.736
We showed him the photo of the
fourth victim's tongue in a dish

31:44.804 --> 31:46.105
and he didn't say
it wasn't right.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.439
I mean, he of all people
should have known

31:47.507 --> 31:48.607
it didn't fit any ritual.

31:48.675 --> 31:49.942
And that a Palero
would have taken the head.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.477
But he wants us to believe
that Elian's a Palero

31:51.544 --> 31:52.778
and that these are
religious killings.

31:52.846 --> 31:54.146
And he did his research
in the community.

31:54.214 --> 31:55.447
He'd be known
and accepted.

31:55.515 --> 31:56.782
He knows the rituals
inside out.

31:56.850 --> 31:58.951
Maybe he gave the idol
to the kid,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.086
pretending to train him
as a witch doctor.

32:01.154 --> 32:02.488
If Elian
was angry with Julio,

32:02.555 --> 32:04.389
he may have been looking
for another father figure.

32:04.457 --> 32:05.824
Elian was easy prey.

32:05.892 --> 32:08.327
What better way to get publicity
than a series of murders?

32:08.394 --> 32:10.095
Yeah, Garcia, get us
everything you can

32:10.163 --> 32:11.830
on Professor
Walker's background.

32:11.898 --> 32:13.132
Got that?
And his address.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.700
Let's go.
We'll take the house,

32:14.767 --> 32:15.834
Morgan and Reid,
take the office.

32:28.548 --> 32:29.648
Elian.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.319
Elian!

32:45.914 --> 32:48.766
Walker's prep school did
a psych eval when he was 12.

32:48.866 --> 32:50.133
He did not exactly fit in.

32:50.201 --> 32:51.334
No surprise there.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.436
And his mother
committed suicide

32:53.504 --> 32:54.938
when he went away
to boarding school,

32:55.005 --> 32:56.973
and to make things
stranger and sadder,

32:57.041 --> 33:00.476
after she died, he spent
all of his vacations at school.

33:00.544 --> 33:04.614
What kind of father doesn't bring his
motherless kid home for the holidays?

33:04.682 --> 33:05.815
A crappy one.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.150
His medical records

33:07.218 --> 33:09.285
list a bunch of childhood
injuries,

33:09.353 --> 33:11.588
including two spiral fractures

33:11.655 --> 33:13.022
of the forearm
and one broken collarbone.

33:13.090 --> 33:15.859
Well, two spiral fractures
are unlikely to be accidents.

33:15.926 --> 33:17.493
Put that together
with the mother's suicide,

33:17.561 --> 33:18.995
I think we're looking at
an abusive father.

33:19.063 --> 33:20.763
Garcia, what can you
find out about the father?

33:20.831 --> 33:22.599
- A lot.
- Like what?

33:22.666 --> 33:25.535
He wrote 10 books,
all on African religions.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.337
The Professor's in
competition with the father.

33:27.404 --> 33:29.072
Yeah, and here's the kicker.

33:29.139 --> 33:30.573
His son is mentioned
in this article

33:30.641 --> 33:32.942
and that he's up for tenure
in the same field.

33:41.485 --> 33:42.752
Hotch.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.454
The Professor's not at this house.
You got anything?

33:44.521 --> 33:45.655
No, there's no one
here either.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.790
We're gonna look around.

33:47.858 --> 33:52.629
Guys, neighbors reported a
disturbance at the soup kitchen.

33:52.696 --> 33:54.464
Let's go, Reid.

34:00.504 --> 34:02.071
There's nothing unusual
upstairs.

34:02.139 --> 34:04.107
Reid's going through Julio's room
to see if we missed anything.

34:04.174 --> 34:06.242
They found these
in the refrigerator.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.977
Looks like
he dug those up.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.280
Those weren't there
when we were here earlier.

34:10.347 --> 34:11.848
They were planted
to make it look like

34:11.916 --> 34:13.349
Elian completed
the ritual.

34:13.417 --> 34:15.952
Which means the Professor's
ready to wrap this up.

34:33.536 --> 34:34.670
Up till now,
all the victims

34:34.737 --> 34:35.772
have been killed
in their homes.

34:35.839 --> 34:38.641
It looks like the body
was dragged that way,

34:38.708 --> 34:39.976
but the trail stops.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.911
Walker laid that trail.
He wants us to think

34:41.978 --> 34:44.580
that he took Julio
out the front door.

34:44.648 --> 34:46.081
But, really,
he could be anywhere.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.583
They are ghosts.

35:15.646 --> 35:18.681
All of the victims
were killed in their homes.

35:58.589 --> 36:00.723
Reid?

36:17.541 --> 36:19.342
You really shouldn't
be here.

36:19.410 --> 36:20.977
I'll check down there.

36:21.045 --> 36:22.745
Reid!

36:22.813 --> 36:24.714
Get inside.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.516
You're a Professor
and you're very smart.

36:26.583 --> 36:28.317
You're a lot smarter
than this.

36:28.385 --> 36:29.419
Smarter.

36:29.486 --> 36:30.987
Prentiss,
is Reid out front with you?

36:31.055 --> 36:33.289
No. No one's come out
since you went inside.

36:33.357 --> 36:37.126
Your gun, please.
Toss it over there.

36:39.029 --> 36:41.931
People like you and I
don't need guns.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.633
Like you and I.

36:43.700 --> 36:44.867
Yeah. Men of intelligence.

36:44.935 --> 36:46.402
Oh, we're the same?

36:46.470 --> 36:48.304
Shut up.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.772
I think that there are
some similarities.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.408
I mean, uh,
we both love books.

36:52.476 --> 36:54.077
Books?

36:55.145 --> 36:56.712
Ah.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.819
He's not answering
his phone.

37:05.189 --> 37:07.123
You shut up.
Shut up.

37:07.191 --> 37:09.959
You know what?
I don't--I don't believe that you killed

37:10.027 --> 37:11.461
all these people
just to sell a book.

37:11.528 --> 37:13.463
Oh, really?

37:13.530 --> 37:17.300
Elian will die of an overdose after
killing his santero for his fingers.

37:17.367 --> 37:19.135
It will all make sense
to the police.

37:20.137 --> 37:22.638
Reid's vest?

37:22.706 --> 37:25.708
Well, this is not good.

37:25.776 --> 37:26.742
How are you going
to explain me?

37:26.810 --> 37:28.611
Elian will have
killed you, too.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.547
Have we not established
how ill he is?

37:31.615 --> 37:33.149
He's been on a Palo rampage.

37:33.217 --> 37:35.318
Everyone will want to learn
about the religion

37:35.385 --> 37:36.419
That drove the boy crazy.

37:36.487 --> 37:38.020
Will you shut up!

37:40.657 --> 37:42.058
Wait a minute, Rossi.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.328
That's the building
right out here.

37:51.034 --> 37:55.104
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I don't
believe that this is about a book.

37:55.172 --> 37:56.606
And I don't think
that you do, either.

37:56.673 --> 37:59.242
Excuse me?

37:59.309 --> 38:03.279
I--I think it's more about
the abuse, the abandonment,

38:03.347 --> 38:05.348
and the lack of attention
from your father.

38:05.415 --> 38:06.616
That's enough.

38:06.683 --> 38:08.351
You know what
the ridiculous thing is,

38:08.418 --> 38:09.952
is that you--

38:10.020 --> 38:13.022
You set up a paradigm where you
actually have to get caught.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.891
Think about it.
If you get away with this,

38:14.958 --> 38:16.959
your father will never know
that you did any of it.

38:18.028 --> 38:19.962
What is wrong with you?

38:20.030 --> 38:21.898
I'm sorry, it's just very
bright in here for me.

38:21.965 --> 38:23.966
Please turn the lights off.
Bright?

38:24.034 --> 38:25.301
The light--what are you--

38:25.369 --> 38:27.537
just shut up! Just shut--

38:31.141 --> 38:32.508
FBI!
FBI!

38:32.576 --> 38:34.210
We're going to need
an ambulance.

38:34.278 --> 38:36.913
Elian's been overdosed with heroin.
Get an ambulance.

38:36.980 --> 38:37.980
Don't hurt me.

38:38.048 --> 38:39.649
You have the right to
remain silent. Use it.

38:39.716 --> 38:44.086
Do you think he'll come to see me in jail?
Do you think he'll visit?

38:44.154 --> 38:45.855
My father.
Who?

38:45.923 --> 38:48.658
He'll hear about this,
right? I'll be pretty famous.

38:48.725 --> 38:50.359
Oh, he's gonna
hear about it, all right.

38:50.427 --> 38:51.994
What?
You heard me calling.

38:52.062 --> 38:53.896
You heard me calling.
That's why you came.

38:53.964 --> 38:57.066
Julio, I found a photograph of
you in front of this building.

38:57.134 --> 38:58.434
That's how I found you.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.269
You don't really
believe that, do you?

39:00.337 --> 39:03.806
That you just happened
to see a photograph?

39:05.609 --> 39:08.244
This is Orula's Ide.
It will protect you.

39:08.312 --> 39:11.681
I don't need it anymore,
but...

39:11.748 --> 39:12.949
You do.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.187
What do you need
protecting from?

39:18.255 --> 39:19.522
I have no idea.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.123
Are you all right?

39:21.191 --> 39:22.959
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I--I am.

39:23.026 --> 39:25.861
I pretended to have a headache
in order to distract him.

39:25.929 --> 39:27.563
Pretended.

39:27.631 --> 39:29.165
Yeah, pretended.

39:36.673 --> 39:38.874
That doesn't make any sense.

39:38.942 --> 39:41.877
I'm not sure what
you want me to say.

39:41.945 --> 39:43.479
So there's nothing wrong?

39:43.547 --> 39:45.881
Well, your scans
are perfectly normal,

39:45.949 --> 39:48.451
and there doesn't seem to be
any physical explanation

39:48.518 --> 39:51.020
for your headaches.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.556
Well, what do I do now?

39:53.624 --> 39:56.225
Well, have you considered...

39:56.293 --> 39:58.294
Considered what?

39:58.362 --> 39:59.929
A psychosomatic cause.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.597
Psychosomatic?

40:01.665 --> 40:04.066
It just means a mental
or emotional stress--

40:04.134 --> 40:07.103
I know what psychosomatic means,
doctor, but it's not that.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.071
Well, I think it's something
we should consider.

40:09.139 --> 40:11.207
It's not--I'm not crazy.

40:11.275 --> 40:13.109
Crazy? Dr. Reid,
I'm not saying--

40:13.176 --> 40:14.777
I have headaches.
I have intense sensitivity to light

40:14.845 --> 40:16.445
because there's
something wrong with me

40:16.513 --> 40:18.948
physically, not mentally.
It's not that.

40:19.016 --> 40:20.283
That?

40:20.350 --> 40:21.851
Listen, doctor, my mother's
a paranoid schizophrenic

40:21.918 --> 40:23.252
who's been
institutionalized,

40:23.320 --> 40:25.988
so I know very well what
mental illness looks like,

40:26.056 --> 40:30.192
maybe even better than you,
and it's not that. It's not.

40:36.099 --> 40:38.801
"The best and most
beautiful things in life

40:38.869 --> 40:40.970
"cannot be seen
or even touched.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.039
They must be felt
with the heart."

40:43.106 --> 40:45.141
