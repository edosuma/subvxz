that place into a gold mine.

09:22.649 --> 09:23.650
Uh, super sexy actor.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.347
John Malkovich.
Yes!Incredible.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.436
Uh, discovered...Galileo!

09:27.479 --> 09:30.221
Maybe we should
be hugging you.

09:30.265 --> 09:34.443
Okay, final groups going in.
Have your tickets out.

09:34.486 --> 09:35.487
Ah, we're going in.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.620
Have a beautiful experience.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.100
Who has our ticket?

09:39.143 --> 09:40.580
Have a beautiful experience.[gasps] Christy.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.670
Have a beautiful experience.
Ticket.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.672
Uh, sorry, we have a bit
of a situation here.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.412
The person in our group
who has the ticket

09:47.456 --> 09:49.414
is-- just stepped away
for a moment.

09:49.458 --> 09:53.027
Well, then, you are not gonna
have a beautiful experience.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.167
Hey. Where is everyone?

10:03.211 --> 10:05.126
Inside, getting hugged.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.563
You guys didn't have
to wait for me.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.609
Yes, we did.
You have the ticket.

10:09.652 --> 10:13.351
Oh, no. Oh. Ugh.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.266
Ah, here it is.
We can go now.

10:15.310 --> 10:18.705
It's too late.
They closed the doors.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.055
Well, maybe if I explain...

10:21.098 --> 10:23.623
We tried. And that was before
the ushers took off their vests

10:23.666 --> 10:25.494
and started playing
hacky sack.

10:25.537 --> 10:28.149
Sorry, guys.

10:28.192 --> 10:31.587
Mm-mm. Batting those big blue
eyes is not gonna save you.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.067
I don't know,
it's kinda working on me.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.242
Do it again.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.987
Dhara comes once a year,
and you ruined it.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.728
Jill...
No.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.166
Ever since she started smoking,
all we do is wait for her.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.429
We can't finish
a conversation,

10:47.472 --> 10:48.996
we can't leave on time,

10:49.039 --> 10:50.824
we can't have a once in
a lifetime opportunity

10:50.867 --> 10:52.652
to achieve inner
frickin' peace!

10:52.695 --> 10:54.784
I am so, so sorry.

10:54.828 --> 10:58.179
You care more about your damn
cigarettes than you do us.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.441
But that's okay.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.356
You go on smoking

11:01.399 --> 11:03.880
and we'll go on waiting and
waiting and waiting for you.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.491
Let's just cut our losses
and go home.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.103
Cable car.Fine, cable car!

11:10.757 --> 11:14.499
I know this is bad timing,
but...

11:14.543 --> 11:16.501
can you wait while I go pee?

11:16.545 --> 11:18.721
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna...No.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.854
Oh, no, no!Get off... get off of me!

11:20.897 --> 11:22.899
You come back here!

11:25.336 --> 11:27.599
Thanks.
Come again.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.080
[quietly]:
Please.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.387
You know, there was a time

11:32.430 --> 11:34.737
I thought I might do something
with my singing voice.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.434
Then I got my girlfriend
pregnant.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.393
So, instead

11:38.436 --> 11:41.352
I spent the next 30 years
climbing telephone poles.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.832
Yeah, that's rough.

11:45.661 --> 11:51.362
♪ I am a lineman
for the county ♪

11:51.406 --> 11:56.150

11:56.193 --> 11:57.804

11:57.847 --> 12:00.284
Beautiful voice, what a waste.

12:00.328 --> 12:03.418
Hey, you think Bonnie's right?

12:03.461 --> 12:05.681
Should I make some changes
to this place?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.465
Nah, I like it the way it is.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.119
Don't worry,
word's gonna spread.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.034
Who's gonna tell 'em?
You're always here.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.863
[sighs]

12:13.907 --> 12:15.038
Hey.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.084
Uh-oh.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.433
No, it's okay.

12:18.476 --> 12:21.436
I just came to say
I was wrong.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.786
This is your place, your vision,

12:23.830 --> 12:25.788
and I shouldn't have tried
to change it.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.921
I appreciate that.

12:27.964 --> 12:31.489
I'm just gonna sit here,
quietly, and support you.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.188
[chuckles]
Cool.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.888

Compass.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.205
You are north of me.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.078
Ooh, I'll check in on Yelp.

12:55.122 --> 12:59.126
"Bonnie P. is at
AJ's Barrelworks."

12:59.169 --> 13:01.432
You only have one review.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.738
That's me.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.827
Only four stars, Mike?

13:04.871 --> 13:09.440
I worried if I gave it five,
the place would be packed.

13:09.484 --> 13:12.661
Yeah, we wouldn't want that.

13:12.704 --> 13:16.447
Well, you are about to get
a five-star review.

13:16.491 --> 13:17.927
[Siri chimes]

13:17.971 --> 13:21.235
AJ's Barrelworks is everything
you're looking for

13:21.278 --> 13:23.672
in a neighborhood bar.

13:23.715 --> 13:29.243
I dare you to walk into this
lovingly restored barrel factory

13:29.286 --> 13:31.854
and not want to sit down
and have a drink.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.422
There's even a dog,

13:34.465 --> 13:37.294
the cutest dog
you've ever seen in your life.

13:37.338 --> 13:42.822
The game's on, but it's not on.

13:42.865 --> 13:46.521
And when you're here,

13:46.564 --> 13:50.307
the world feels
a million miles away.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.656
Huh.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.658
I get it, honey.

13:53.702 --> 13:56.792
Karaoke would totally ruin
this place.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.750
Thank you.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.766
You're looking at me
like I'm not a part of this.

CHRISTY:
You are a terrible person.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.213
You're awful,

14:26.256 --> 14:28.389
you're a bad friend,
you're selfish,

14:28.432 --> 14:31.871
and one of your ears
is bigger than the other.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.613
How did I not notice that?

14:35.657 --> 14:38.747
That's another thing--
you never notice anything.

14:38.790 --> 14:42.794
WOMAN [Indian accent]:
Would you please pass
me some toilet paper?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.448
Oh, uh...

14:44.492 --> 14:45.841
Oh, sure.

Yeah!

15:33.193 --> 15:35.891
As soon as I get another
customer, I'm kicking you out.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.025
All right, I've been holding
onto this lucky pee for the win.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.294
I've really enjoyed
watching you today.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.776
Little creepy, Mike.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.475
Not like that.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.737
It just blew me away

15:55.780 --> 15:57.130
how you came back
and apologized.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.870
And you, like, meant it.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.699
Yeah, when I'm wrong,
I like to own it.

16:01.743 --> 16:04.876
When I'm wrong,
I just dig in.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.878
That used to be me.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.751
I would move out of state
before I'd admit I was wrong.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.014
Literally spent
two years in Tucson

16:12.058 --> 16:13.494
to avoid saying,
"Maybe you were right."

16:15.017 --> 16:16.758
Very sunny, bring a hat.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.850
Point is, I started going
to AA a few years ago.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.983
Now I'm apologizing
left and right.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.941
And you know what?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.725
It's made my life better.

16:27.769 --> 16:31.903
Wow. You're sober
and your fiancé opened a bar?

16:31.947 --> 16:33.731
Yeah, don't get me started.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.778
Well, I got to go.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.783
The wife was pretty steamed
when I left.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.307
Wish she was like you
and would just say I was right.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.874
Were you?

16:45.917 --> 16:46.918
No.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.749
You're not gonna drive home,
are you?

16:51.793 --> 16:54.752
I live across the street.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.928
But you're right,
I shouldn't drive.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.022
Yeah, definitely not.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.157
Where'd Mike go?

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
He went home.
He left his keys.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.248
Great, let's sell his car
and pay some bills.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.819
It's so weird how
we're still standing in line

17:17.862 --> 17:20.039
and there isn't even
a line anymore.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.129
I hope Christy's okay.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.391
Of course she's okay.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.045
She's smoking.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.004
And I'm gonna tell her she
can go get home on the bus.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.919
Jill, calm down.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.834

ever worked?

really on there.

Okay, so how was it?

18:12.917 --> 18:16.443
Honestly, it was kinda
life-changing.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.358
You could've downplayed it
a little.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.707
I did.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.885
For one solid minute,

18:23.928 --> 18:25.974
Dhara gave me her full attention

18:26.017 --> 18:29.586

valued.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.980
Well, yippee for you.

I haven't been giving you guys

18:34.200 --> 18:35.940
the attention you deserve.

I'm always late,

my head's in a different place.

That's exactly what
I've been saying.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.907
Jill, you came here for a hug

18:45.950 --> 18:47.430
and you're gonna get one.

18:49.432 --> 18:53.044
For the next minute,
it's just you and me.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.046

a regular person.

what my intention was.

anything strange about my ears?

the little one?

a happy spiritual place lately,

20:13.299 --> 20:14.865

Well, don't worry,
no happy people here.

Seriously?

20:27.008 --> 20:30.011
Yeah. Evidently
something I said rang true.

20:30.054 --> 20:32.883
Nice work, Johnny Applesober.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.799
This place is cool.

Hey, welcome.

Keep your mouth shut.

about you on Yelp.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.936
Where's the dog?

Oh, he's around here somewhere.

What are you drinking?

This is our third day in Napa.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.427
