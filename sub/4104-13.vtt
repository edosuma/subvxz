00:02.281 --> 00:03.490
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:03.615 --> 00:05.367
- Mom?
- You're being sent to the ground.

00:05.492 --> 00:06.535
<i>All 100 of you.</i>

00:06.952 --> 00:08.912
<i>Prisoners of the Ark,
you have one job...</i>

00:09.538 --> 00:10.622
<i>...stay alive.</i>

00:10.747 --> 00:13.250
<i>To do that, you must locate
Mount Weather immediately.</i>

00:15.043 --> 00:16.523
<i>Nothing we've tried
will save the Ark.</i>

00:16.628 --> 00:18.046
Have you tried not saving it?

00:18.130 --> 00:20.882
Are we really gonna do this?
Bring the Ark to the ground?

00:25.387 --> 00:27.723
You started a war that
you don't know how to end.

00:27.848 --> 00:29.891
You have no idea
what your people have done.

00:30.058 --> 00:31.393
We had to stop the attack.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.841
The mountain men... They'll come,
and they'll kill us all.

00:35.272 --> 00:36.732
- Raven!
- Murphy shot her.

00:37.316 --> 00:39.002
- Get her into the dropship.
- We need to leave.

00:39.026 --> 00:41.278
There's an army of Grounders
coming for us right now.

00:41.403 --> 00:44.072
If we stay here, we will die tonight.

00:44.197 --> 00:47.326
So pack your things.
Just take what you can carry.

00:48.577 --> 00:49.578
Now!

01:07.554 --> 01:09.389
That should stop
the external bleeding.

01:10.182 --> 01:12.726
I don't understand.
How did Murphy get a gun?

01:12.851 --> 01:15.228
- Long story.
- We got lucky.

01:15.354 --> 01:17.939
If Murphy hit the fuel tank
instead of me, we'd all be dead.

01:18.106 --> 01:21.443
Wait, there's rocket fuel down there?
Enough to build a bomb?

01:21.610 --> 01:24.905
Enough to build a hundred bombs,
if we had any gunpowder left.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.075
Let's get back to the Reapers.
Maybe they'll help us.

01:28.575 --> 01:30.911
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend," right?

01:31.453 --> 01:33.955
Not this enemy. We saw them.
Trust me...

01:34.456 --> 01:36.351
- ...that's not an option.
- There's no time for this.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.335
- Can she walk or not?
- No.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.088
- We have to carry her.
- The hell you will. I'm good to go.

01:41.213 --> 01:45.133
Hey! Listen to me.
That bullet is still inside you.

01:45.634 --> 01:47.636
If by some miracle
there's no internal bleeding,

01:47.761 --> 01:49.638
it might hold until we get
somewhere safe.

01:49.763 --> 01:52.140
But you are not walking there.
Is that clear?

01:53.350 --> 01:54.643
Yeah.

01:55.143 --> 01:56.311
Get the stretcher.

01:57.354 --> 02:00.649
Can't run away fast enough, huh?
Real brave.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.485
Dying in a fight you can't win
isn't brave, Bellamy. It's stupid.

02:03.610 --> 02:06.154
Spoken like every coward
who's ever run from a fight.

02:06.321 --> 02:07.447
All right, that's enough!

02:10.449 --> 02:11.451
It's time to go.

02:12.244 --> 02:15.288
If they follow, it's a 120-mile walk
to the ocean.

02:15.414 --> 02:19.334
Look, we're wasting time.
If he wants to stay, he can stay.

02:19.501 --> 02:20.669
No, he can't.

02:26.299 --> 02:28.009
We can't do this without you, Bellamy.

02:29.302 --> 02:30.971
What do you want me to say, Clarke?

02:32.013 --> 02:34.015
I want you to say that
you're with us.

02:35.142 --> 02:37.269
Those kids out there,
they listen to you.

02:37.686 --> 02:40.730
They're lining up to go.
They listen to you more.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.149
I gave them an easy choice.

02:42.774 --> 02:46.570
But five minutes ago, they were
willing to fight and die for you.

02:47.070 --> 02:48.196
You inspire them.

02:52.576 --> 02:55.537
And I'm afraid we're gonna need that
again before this day is through.

03:03.712 --> 03:04.796
Okay, here we go.

03:05.714 --> 03:07.424
<i>Guns at the ready!</i>

03:07.966 --> 03:09.092
<i>Keep your eyes open.</i>

03:39.873 --> 03:41.124
You did good here, Bellamy.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.836
- Eighteen dead.
- Eighty-two alive.

03:46.630 --> 03:47.631
You did good.

04:36.221 --> 04:38.723
You know the first thing I'm gonna do
when I get to the beach?

04:38.848 --> 04:41.476
- No, what?
- I'm going surfing.

04:41.601 --> 04:43.770
Quiet. Keep your eyes open.

04:44.062 --> 04:47.983
No more woods. Hear the ocean.
No damn trees. Just pale blue water.

04:52.988 --> 04:53.989
What is it?

04:56.741 --> 04:57.951
Why are we stopping?

04:59.661 --> 05:00.662
I don't know.

05:02.455 --> 05:03.748
I don't see anything.

05:11.172 --> 05:13.174
Grounders!

05:19.180 --> 05:20.473
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

05:28.023 --> 05:29.357
<i>Shut the gate!</i>

05:30.817 --> 05:31.817
<i>Load your guns.</i>

05:35.530 --> 05:37.032
Get her inside the dropship.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.117
Yeah, we got her.

05:46.833 --> 05:49.127
Where are they?
Why aren't they attacking?

05:51.546 --> 05:53.923
Because we're doing exactly
what they wanted us to do.

05:54.591 --> 05:55.800
What're you talking about?

05:57.385 --> 05:59.447
Lincoln said the scouts
would be the first to arrive.

05:59.471 --> 06:01.115
If it's just scouts,
we can fight our way out.

06:01.139 --> 06:02.849
That's what Lincoln would do.

06:02.974 --> 06:05.060
We're done doing
what that Grounder would do.

06:05.644 --> 06:07.804
We tried it, and now Drew is dead.
You want to be next?

06:07.896 --> 06:09.606
That Grounder saved our lives.

06:10.398 --> 06:13.401
I agree with Octavia. For all we know
there's one scout out there.

06:13.526 --> 06:15.195
One scout with insanely good aim.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.072
Clarke, we can still do this.

06:20.950 --> 06:23.787
Looking to you, princess.
What's it going to be?

06:24.579 --> 06:26.414
Run and get picked off
out in the open?

06:26.581 --> 06:28.249
Or stand and fight back?

06:40.261 --> 06:42.764
Clarke, if we're still here
when Tristan gets here...

06:43.223 --> 06:45.392
Lincoln said scouts.
More than one.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.144
He said,
"Get home before the scouts arrive."

06:48.269 --> 06:49.729
Finn, they're already here.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.760
Looks like you've got your fight.

06:54.192 --> 06:57.445
Okay then. This is what
we've been preparing for.

06:57.612 --> 07:00.824
Kill them before they kill us.
Gunners, to your posts.

07:01.282 --> 07:03.451
Use the tunnels to get in and out.

07:03.618 --> 07:05.912
From now on the gate stays closed.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.626
Oh, oh.

07:12.585 --> 07:14.754
- You're not a gunner.
- No, I'm not.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.799
Like you said, I'm a Grounder.

07:25.598 --> 07:27.318
All right,
let's get through those foxholes.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.563
So how the hell do we do this?

07:31.688 --> 07:34.691
We've got 25 rifles
with 20 rounds each, give or take.

07:34.816 --> 07:36.484
Roughly 500 rounds of ammo.

07:37.277 --> 07:39.654
While you two were gone
we made some improvements.

07:39.779 --> 07:42.198
Thanks to Raven, the gully's mined.

07:42.323 --> 07:44.784
Partially mined, thanks to Murphy.

07:45.285 --> 07:46.953
Still, it's the main route in.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.830
And if the Grounders use it,
we'll know.

07:49.497 --> 07:50.749
She also built grenades.

07:51.791 --> 07:54.794
- It's not many.
- Again, thank you, Murphy.

07:56.838 --> 07:58.298
We'll make 'em count.

07:58.423 --> 08:01.217
If the Grounders make it
through the front gate,

08:01.342 --> 08:03.553
guns and grenades
should force them back.

08:05.388 --> 08:06.389
And then?

08:07.307 --> 08:09.058
Then we close the door and pray.

08:10.685 --> 08:12.020
And pray what?

08:12.312 --> 08:14.355
That the ship keeps them out,
because it won't.

08:18.318 --> 08:20.078
Then let's not let them
get through the gate.

08:20.236 --> 08:21.780
All foxholes, listen up.

08:21.905 --> 08:23.573
<i>Keep your eyes and ears open.</i>

08:23.698 --> 08:26.159
<i>Inflict casualties,
as many as possible.</i>

08:26.284 --> 08:28.953
We can hold them off long enough
to make them turn back.

08:29.078 --> 08:30.163
That's the plan.

08:30.288 --> 08:33.374
That's always your plan.
Just like the bomb at the bridge.

08:34.292 --> 08:36.753
Damn right.
You got a better idea?

08:38.379 --> 08:39.380
Can't be that simple.

08:43.301 --> 08:45.595
You said there's fuel
in those rockets, right?

08:46.054 --> 08:47.931
Enough to build a hundred bombs.

08:48.097 --> 08:50.099
I also said
we've got no gunpowder left.

08:51.142 --> 08:52.519
I don't want to build a bomb.

08:54.062 --> 08:55.355
I want to blast off.

08:57.273 --> 08:58.566
Draw them in close.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.027
Fire the rockets.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.363
A ring of fire.

09:04.322 --> 09:07.033
Barbecued Grounders.
I like it.

09:07.909 --> 09:08.910
But will it work?

09:11.704 --> 09:14.791
The wiring's a mess down there,
but yeah.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.795
You give me enough time,
I'll cook them real good.

09:23.925 --> 09:25.969
<i>Here's how we bring the Ark
to the ground.</i>

09:26.135 --> 09:29.305
Stage one, separation from Go site.

09:30.348 --> 09:31.349
Series of explosions.

09:31.474 --> 09:34.602
Sever the ring that we are now
standing in from the rest of the Ark.

09:34.727 --> 09:38.481
Now, once we have separation
all port thrusters will fire

09:38.606 --> 09:40.567
and our orbit will begin to degrade.

09:41.025 --> 09:42.902
Stage two, reentry.

09:43.695 --> 09:48.032
Reentry will be violent
and it will be very, very hot.

09:48.324 --> 09:51.327
Friction will break the Ark back into
its original stations.

09:52.078 --> 09:55.623
Some of the stations,
and we can't predict which...

09:56.666 --> 09:58.126
...will explode.

10:00.169 --> 10:01.963
Some of us will be on those stations.

10:04.966 --> 10:07.552
Which brings us to stage three,
landing.

10:08.136 --> 10:11.180
All starboard thrusters
on the surviving stations will fire.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.057
Acting as landing rockets,

10:13.141 --> 10:15.018
they will slow
the impact even further.

10:15.184 --> 10:19.522
And our target speed for impact
with the ground is 70 miles per hour.

10:19.814 --> 10:23.818
In all my simulations,
anything above that is not survivable.

10:24.944 --> 10:26.195
<i>This isn't safe.</i>

10:26.529 --> 10:28.531
<i>There's no way
we can survive this.</i>

10:30.533 --> 10:33.536
No one said that this would be easy,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.168
It's just that if we don't try it,
we all die.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.884
So how close are we gonna land
to the kids?

10:54.557 --> 10:55.683
As close as we can.

11:03.942 --> 11:07.028
- Finn, do you see it over there?
<i>- No.</i>

11:07.236 --> 11:09.364
<i>Raven, we can't find
the ignition system.</i>

11:12.742 --> 11:13.743
<i>Raven?</i>

11:16.579 --> 11:20.083
- I can't feel my legs.
<i>- Okay, hold on. We're coming.</i>

11:24.545 --> 11:26.089
Okay, let me see.

11:47.735 --> 11:49.362
That bad, huh?

11:56.786 --> 11:58.204
Raven...

12:00.331 --> 12:01.541
...the bullet's in your spine.

12:06.629 --> 12:08.089
You're bleeding internally.

12:14.053 --> 12:15.373
We better do this fast then, huh?

12:16.639 --> 12:17.640
Get back down there.

12:20.018 --> 12:21.019
Okay.

12:21.144 --> 12:23.479
What if we can slow the bleeding?
Would that help?

12:24.105 --> 12:26.858
Of course it would help.
Can you tell me how to do that?

12:26.983 --> 12:28.901
That stuff the Grounders had.
Coagulant.

12:29.027 --> 12:30.421
You said that Lincoln had some too.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.297
Yeah, it's in the box
with the antidote. But I...

12:32.321 --> 12:34.216
I'm betting that there's more of it
in his cave. If I can...

12:34.240 --> 12:36.117
Wait a second. No!

12:38.119 --> 12:39.120
I can make it.

12:40.329 --> 12:42.790
Clarke, tell him he's being an idiot.

12:43.374 --> 12:45.209
- Raven.
- What?

12:46.502 --> 12:47.962
I'm not gonna let you die
to save me.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.463
Fine.

12:50.381 --> 12:53.843
If you won't let me save you,
how about we save everybody else?

12:56.429 --> 12:58.514
You're the only one
who can fire those rockets.

13:02.060 --> 13:04.604
If you die, we all die.

13:08.524 --> 13:09.776
I'll be right back.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.528
Finn, wait.

13:13.196 --> 13:17.033
- Wait.
- Clarke, I need to do this.

13:20.995 --> 13:22.163
I can't lose you again.

13:27.001 --> 13:28.002
You won't.

13:38.721 --> 13:39.972
<i>Hydro station, good to go.</i>

13:41.265 --> 13:42.850
<i>Mecha station, good to go.</i>

13:43.518 --> 13:44.685
<i>Factory station, good to go.</i>

13:45.728 --> 13:47.188
<i>Aero station, good to go.</i>

13:48.606 --> 13:49.941
<i>Power station, good to go.</i>

13:50.858 --> 13:54.195
<i>Chancellor Jaha,
all stations are prepared for launch.</i>

13:57.907 --> 13:58.991
In peace...

14:00.576 --> 14:03.037
...may you leave this shore.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.707
<i>In love, may you find the next.</i>

14:08.793 --> 14:13.131
<i>Safe passage on your travels
until our final journey to the ground.</i>

14:14.549 --> 14:17.593
- May we meet again.
- May we meet again.

14:17.747 --> 14:19.747
- May we meet again.
- May we meet again.

14:21.722 --> 14:23.766
<i>- Sinclair.</i>
- Yes, sir.

14:25.893 --> 14:28.229
- Take us home.
- Taking us home, sir.

14:31.065 --> 14:33.067
Initiate Go site separation.

14:34.277 --> 14:35.277
<i>In five...</i>

14:36.362 --> 14:37.363
<i>Four...</i>

14:38.614 --> 14:39.615
<i>Three...</i>

14:40.867 --> 14:41.868
<i>Two...</i>

14:43.369 --> 14:44.370
One.

14:45.830 --> 14:46.831
Separate.

14:59.427 --> 15:01.179
Sir, remote detonations failed.

15:01.596 --> 15:04.473
<i>We are negative for Go site
separation, negative for launch.</i>

15:05.141 --> 15:07.977
- Can you fix it?
- Not from here, sir. No.

15:10.062 --> 15:11.606
Someone will have to launch manually.

15:18.529 --> 15:19.530
What're you doing?

15:21.991 --> 15:23.826
Someone has to stay behind, Abby.

15:24.368 --> 15:25.661
There has to be another way.

15:26.954 --> 15:29.314
I can go back and reprogram
the system, but it'll take time.

15:29.582 --> 15:31.834
We'll miss the window
for the eastern United States.

15:31.959 --> 15:33.061
We won't land anywhere
near the hundred.

15:33.085 --> 15:35.171
Then we'll wait till it comes back
around again.

15:36.464 --> 15:38.090
The Ark will be out of air by then.

15:47.141 --> 15:48.601
Salvation...

15:50.186 --> 15:51.186
...comes at a price.

16:17.964 --> 16:19.048
How much air will he have?

16:21.050 --> 16:23.219
A week. Two weeks at most.

16:37.525 --> 16:39.944
We're away. We're away.
We've launched.

16:42.822 --> 16:43.990
How?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.408
<i>Godspeed, my friends.</i>

16:46.742 --> 16:47.743
<i>Godspeed.</i>

16:50.538 --> 16:54.166
- Thelonious, where are you?
<i>- Right where I'm supposed to be.</i>

16:55.251 --> 16:58.379
Hold on tight, Abby.
You'll see your daughter soon.

17:12.351 --> 17:14.060
And I'll see my son.

17:36.876 --> 17:37.877
They're here.

17:52.808 --> 17:53.809
Where's Octavia?

17:53.934 --> 17:56.103
She left five minutes ago.
Didn't say where to.

17:56.562 --> 17:58.731
She thinks she's a damn samurai.

17:59.482 --> 18:01.108
- See anything?
- No.

18:01.609 --> 18:03.361
What the hell are they
waiting for?

18:03.486 --> 18:05.029
The longer they wait the better.

18:05.237 --> 18:06.989
This is about buying time for Raven.

18:07.156 --> 18:08.616
<i>I see them. They're moving.</i>

18:08.824 --> 18:10.076
<i>I count one, two, three.</i>

18:10.201 --> 18:11.994
<i>No, like there's four.
I don't know man.</i>

18:12.161 --> 18:13.746
<i>There's too damn many of them.</i>

18:14.663 --> 18:16.332
- Who was that?
- Sterling, I think.

18:16.499 --> 18:19.293
South foxhole.
South foxhole, report now!

18:21.837 --> 18:23.964
<i>Yeah, yeah. We're okay.</i>

18:24.173 --> 18:26.801
<i>They didn't attack.
It's like shooting a ghost.</i>

18:30.596 --> 18:31.597
There!

18:32.431 --> 18:33.557
I see them!

18:35.935 --> 18:37.978
Stop! Stop! Hold your fire!

18:39.188 --> 18:40.398
Hold fire!

18:41.816 --> 18:42.816
Reload, now!

18:44.026 --> 18:45.111
Those are our last clips.

18:46.404 --> 18:47.684
We should...
We should pull back.

18:48.447 --> 18:51.700
No. If this position falls,
they'll walk right to the front door.

19:02.253 --> 19:04.547
- Do you see it or don't you?
- No.

19:05.214 --> 19:07.633
- It's a mess down here.
<i>- It'll be orange.</i>

19:08.092 --> 19:09.092
Look harder.

19:10.719 --> 19:11.929
<i>Foxhole, report.</i>

19:12.054 --> 19:13.472
<i>You have to find the wire</i>

19:13.556 --> 19:16.267
<i>that connects the manual override
to electromagnet.</i>

19:17.935 --> 19:19.228
It's not rocket science.

19:20.312 --> 19:22.064
It is rocket science, actually.

19:25.401 --> 19:27.736
Guess we finally found something
you're not good at.

19:34.702 --> 19:36.495
I used to be picked first
for everything.

19:38.205 --> 19:39.206
<i>Earth skills.</i>

19:41.542 --> 19:42.751
Zero G Mac course.

19:45.171 --> 19:46.172
First.

19:47.131 --> 19:48.132
Every time.

19:55.222 --> 19:56.640
So how did I end up here?

20:03.481 --> 20:04.482
Hey, Raven?

20:10.946 --> 20:12.281
I'd pick you first.

20:17.036 --> 20:18.787
Of course you would.
I'm awesome.

20:26.128 --> 20:30.132
- Hey, I found it. Orange wire.
- About time!

20:30.257 --> 20:32.468
<i>Now follow that wire
to the override panel.</i>

20:37.306 --> 20:41.310
Raven, it's fried.
Totally useless.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.355
<i>Tell me this isn't as bad as I think.</i>

20:46.023 --> 20:47.399
You know how to splice the wire?

20:48.859 --> 20:50.903
- No.
- That's worse.

20:54.615 --> 20:55.616
Aah!

20:56.075 --> 20:59.411
Hey, stop.
Just keep talking me through it.

21:00.204 --> 21:01.204
<i>Get down!</i>

21:01.330 --> 21:02.623
<i>We need back up!</i>

21:10.005 --> 21:11.924
Raven, their mines actually work.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.301
Jasper can splice.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.890
Jasper, we need you in
the dropship right now.

21:20.015 --> 21:22.309
Negative. We can't give up
the west Woods.

21:22.434 --> 21:25.854
The west woods are mined, Bellamy.
The Grounders just figured that out.

21:26.021 --> 21:27.231
<i>Jasper, get in here.</i>

21:27.356 --> 21:28.899
I see one! There! There!

21:32.695 --> 21:34.154
We're drawing their fire.

21:35.447 --> 21:38.075
- Damn it, I'm all out.
- They want us to run out of ammo.

21:39.034 --> 21:40.286
All gunners, listen up.

21:40.703 --> 21:43.372
<i>The Grounders are not attacking.
They're making us waste bullets.</i>

21:43.497 --> 21:46.125
<i>Don't shoot
when they're running laterally.</i>

21:46.584 --> 21:49.670
Jasper's right. Don't fire until
you're sure it's attack.

21:49.795 --> 21:52.172
<i>Repeat, do not fire
until you are sure.</i>

21:52.923 --> 21:55.134
<i>Clarke, hang tight.
I'm on my way.</i>

22:01.056 --> 22:03.350
That's for not telling us
about the minefield.

22:06.270 --> 22:07.563
What do we do now?

22:11.692 --> 22:12.901
Now we attack.

22:44.350 --> 22:45.934
Here they come.

22:48.437 --> 22:49.647
Monroe, get back there!

22:53.692 --> 22:54.860
Bellamy!

23:11.502 --> 23:14.004
Admit it.
You were wrong.

23:15.255 --> 23:18.592
No! You're hit.
No. Fall back now!

23:19.259 --> 23:21.220
Can you walk?

23:22.137 --> 23:25.891
Oh, hey, hold on to me.
We have to get you behind that wall.

23:38.237 --> 23:40.864
- Lincoln, you made it.
- I told you to leave.

23:40.989 --> 23:43.325
We tried.
The scouts were already there.

23:43.409 --> 23:44.409
<i>Sterling, do you copy?</i>

23:44.451 --> 23:45.451
What is that?

23:48.247 --> 23:49.683
<i>I'll go back
to camp to get more bullets.</i>

23:49.707 --> 23:50.833
Why are you not there?

23:50.999 --> 23:52.042
Raven was shot.

23:52.209 --> 23:53.836
We need medicine
to slow the bleeding.

23:53.961 --> 23:56.380
- You came to save one life?
- I don't have time to explain.

23:56.505 --> 23:59.466
- Do you have the medicine or not?
- I have it.

24:03.387 --> 24:04.680
<i>Fall back!</i>

24:05.723 --> 24:07.349
<i>No, stand your ground.</i>

24:07.474 --> 24:09.184
<i>If they take the gate,
we're all dead.</i>

24:10.686 --> 24:12.312
I'm going with you.
Let's go.

24:15.899 --> 24:17.359
Wait.

24:22.030 --> 24:24.783
- "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
- Finn, let's move.

24:24.908 --> 24:26.493
How far did the Reapers chase you?

24:27.035 --> 24:29.246
They'd still be chasing
if I didn't lose them, why?

24:31.206 --> 24:33.000
I have a really bad idea.

24:34.710 --> 24:38.005
<i>Hey Raven, tell us again
how this is gonna work.</i>

24:38.922 --> 24:40.758
I told you five times.

24:42.217 --> 24:44.178
Current flows to the electromagnet.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.347
<i>That opens the propel valve.</i>

24:47.473 --> 24:48.932
<i>Rockets fire.</i>

24:49.516 --> 24:52.311
Okay. Got the, uh...
Got the wire ready to graft on.

24:52.478 --> 24:54.146
What's next?

24:55.981 --> 24:57.524
Raven?

24:59.943 --> 25:00.944
Raven.

25:12.664 --> 25:15.876
- Is she?
- Not yet. But soon.

25:16.001 --> 25:17.127
<i>They've broken through.</i>

25:17.294 --> 25:18.587
<i>There's hundreds of them.</i>

25:18.754 --> 25:21.715
<i>They're heading for the gate.
Game over, man.</i>

25:23.467 --> 25:24.510
Finish it.

25:25.844 --> 25:28.972
Current to magnet
to valve to barbecue.

25:29.139 --> 25:31.517
Current to magnet
to valve to barbecue.

25:39.274 --> 25:41.819
There are too many!
Everybody to the dropship, now.

25:42.194 --> 25:44.488
No, we need more time.

25:44.613 --> 25:47.366
Gunners, stay at your posts.
The rest of you, inside.

25:47.658 --> 25:48.951
Come on, quick.

26:12.015 --> 26:13.892
Is that from the Ark?

26:15.769 --> 26:16.895
That is the Ark.

26:36.498 --> 26:37.833
I'm coming, Clarke.

26:44.590 --> 26:46.341
Reinforcements.

26:46.675 --> 26:49.553
When they get here,
they won't find anyone alive.

26:51.847 --> 26:53.140
Take down the gate!

26:53.432 --> 26:55.392
Attack! Attack!

27:03.191 --> 27:05.360
Reapers!

27:44.900 --> 27:45.901
My God!

27:51.281 --> 27:52.824
What did you do?

27:53.742 --> 27:56.662
- We kicked the hornet's nest.
- You brought the Reapers?

27:57.579 --> 27:59.957
I just bought us some time.
How's Raven?

28:00.791 --> 28:01.917
She's not good.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.753
And the rockets aren't ready yet.
Jasper's working on them now.

28:04.878 --> 28:06.004
Wait, Jasper?

28:07.881 --> 28:11.218
- What's plan B?
- Jasper was plan B.

28:15.597 --> 28:17.349
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

28:17.808 --> 28:20.644
While they're distracted,
let's move.

28:22.145 --> 28:24.940
I'll never make it. Leave me.

28:25.065 --> 28:27.734
- I'll find another way.
- I'm not going anywhere without you.

28:27.859 --> 28:28.860
Octavia.

28:30.195 --> 28:31.279
Lincoln.

28:37.452 --> 28:39.121
Who did this?

28:39.413 --> 28:40.747
With Finn.

28:43.583 --> 28:44.751
It's deep.

28:51.049 --> 28:52.969
I can help you, but you have
to come with me now.

28:56.972 --> 28:58.056
Go.

29:00.308 --> 29:02.019
- Let him help.
- No way.

29:02.144 --> 29:03.770
I have to see this through.

29:03.895 --> 29:06.231
You can't walk, and
I can't get you back to the dropship.

29:06.523 --> 29:08.984
He's right.
This fight is over for you.

29:10.193 --> 29:13.321
Ov. Ov, listen to me.

29:14.614 --> 29:17.117
I told you my life ended
the day you were born.

29:19.202 --> 29:22.706
The truth is,
it didn't start until then.

29:24.541 --> 29:28.211
So go with him.
I need you to live.

29:29.212 --> 29:32.632
Besides, I got this.

29:43.518 --> 29:45.020
I love you, big brother.

29:48.190 --> 29:49.441
May we meet again.

29:51.109 --> 29:52.402
May we meet again.

30:04.790 --> 30:05.791
Keep her safe.

30:16.718 --> 30:18.386
Now to the wall!

30:35.195 --> 30:37.823
Clarke, they're taking down the gate.

30:37.948 --> 30:40.534
Good. 'Cause I did it.

30:41.451 --> 30:42.452
I think.

30:46.414 --> 30:48.166
- I'm closing that door.
- Wait.

30:48.750 --> 30:51.253
We still got people out there.
Bellamy's not back yet.

30:51.461 --> 30:53.171
<i>Use the grenades!</i>

30:58.969 --> 31:01.680
All right, Jasper did it.
Everybody get inside now.

31:16.194 --> 31:18.196
- There he is!
- He's never gonna make it.

31:18.321 --> 31:19.614
Bellamy, run!

31:33.879 --> 31:35.630
He's killing him.

31:36.298 --> 31:37.299
Give me that.

31:40.802 --> 31:42.053
No, Finn, no!

31:44.139 --> 31:45.140
No!

31:50.312 --> 31:53.398
Clarke! You can't save everybody.
Let's go!

32:13.835 --> 32:14.920
Clarke, in now!

32:17.297 --> 32:18.548
No!

32:36.107 --> 32:37.692
Aah!

32:45.367 --> 32:47.410
Finally.

32:58.171 --> 32:59.714
Jasper, now!

33:09.975 --> 33:11.393
No...

33:12.394 --> 33:14.688
Anya, you can't win.

33:19.859 --> 33:21.444
Aah!

33:24.864 --> 33:27.701
- Stop! She's not...
- Current close to the magnet.

33:27.909 --> 33:29.619
You just stay put.

33:37.043 --> 33:38.837
Get back! Get back!

33:38.962 --> 33:40.672
Screw her.

33:41.464 --> 33:43.258
- She deserves to die.
- No!

33:45.593 --> 33:48.096
We are not Grounders.

34:27.677 --> 34:29.262
<i>This is Earth Monitoring Station.</i>

34:29.387 --> 34:31.056
<i>Earth Monitoring Station.</i>

34:31.181 --> 34:34.976
Hailing all Ark survivors,
please come in.

34:39.105 --> 34:40.398
Earth Monitoring Station.

34:41.649 --> 34:42.984
Earth Monitoring Station.

34:43.109 --> 34:46.571
Hailing all Ark survivors,
please come in.

34:49.032 --> 34:51.784
Hello? Is someone there?

34:53.328 --> 34:55.663
<i>- The grou...</i>
- Keep talking so I can lock you in.

34:56.498 --> 35:00.168
<i>On the ground, repeat.
Mecha Station is on the ground.</i>

35:04.005 --> 35:06.633
<i>Abby, it's so good to hear
your voice.</i>

35:06.758 --> 35:09.761
Yours too. We made it, Thelonious.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.440
<i>Any word from any
of the other stations yet?</i>

35:12.680 --> 35:14.015
No.

35:15.475 --> 35:16.476
Just you so far.

35:18.978 --> 35:22.440
- Can you see any sign of them?
<i>- Going outside now. Standby.</i>

35:50.760 --> 35:52.595
Tell me what it's like.

35:55.682 --> 35:56.683
It's...

35:59.644 --> 36:00.854
...everything I dreamed.

36:03.648 --> 36:07.527
<i>So much green.
There are trees everywhere.</i>

36:09.112 --> 36:10.238
And water.

36:11.448 --> 36:16.035
<i>And the air, the air smells...</i>

36:17.078 --> 36:18.788
<i>It's sweet.</i>

36:23.418 --> 36:25.044
It's so beautiful.

36:27.589 --> 36:29.257
Thelonious, you should be here.

36:55.492 --> 36:56.618
Abby, look.

37:02.582 --> 37:05.793
There's smoke in the distance.
There might be another station.

37:06.169 --> 37:08.046
<i>- We'll check it out.</i>
- You do that.

37:09.005 --> 37:10.705
Find the rest of
our people, Abby.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.250
<i>Find Clarke.</i>

37:51.631 --> 37:53.091
This will have to do.

38:18.366 --> 38:19.784
May we meet again.

39:38.279 --> 39:39.322
What the hell...

39:39.947 --> 39:41.282
Mountain men.

41:22.508 --> 41:23.509
Clarke.

41:24.385 --> 41:25.386
Monty.
