00:00.459 --> 00:03.212
<i>SUZUKI ST. PIERRE HERE</i>
<i>ON DAY SEVEN OF "MOLLY WATCH,"</i>

00:03.212 --> 00:06.215
<i>WHERE DANIEL MEADE'S BRIDE IS</i>
<i>ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.</i>

00:06.215 --> 00:07.925
<i>FOR THOSE OF YOU LIVING ON MARS</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:10.260
<i>OR IN ONE OF THOSE</i>
<i>WEIRD RELIGIONS THAT SHUNS TV,</i>

00:10.260 --> 00:12.095
<i>MOLLY'S ILLNESS</i>
<i>TOOK A DRAMATIC TURN</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:14.097
<i>WHEN SHE COLLAPSED</i>
<i>ON HER WEDDING NIGHT.</i>
(squeaks and thuds)

00:14.097 --> 00:16.350
<i>THE ONLY BRIGHT SPOT HAS BEEN</i>
<i>DANIEL'S TRANSFORMATION.</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:18.977
<i>THE ONETIME MAN‐WHORE</i>
<i>IS NOW A DEVOTED HUSBAND,</i>

00:18.977 --> 00:21.355
<i>AND NEW YORK CAN'T GET ENOUGH</i>
<i>OF THEIR NEW "IT" COUPLE...</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:24.107
<i>PRINCE CHARMING</i>
<i>AND SOON‐TO‐BE‐SLEEPING BEAUTY.</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:25.901
<i>(cheering)</i>

00:25.901 --> 00:28.111
<i>HERE THEY COME NOW.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:30.781
<i>(woman) DANIEL, WE LOVE YOU!</i>

00:30.781 --> 00:32.699
<i>SO MANY WELL‐WISHERS,</i>

00:32.699 --> 00:35.244
<i>EVEN THAT ADORABLE CLOWN,</i>
<i>OBVIOUSLY ON BREAK</i>

00:35.244 --> 00:37.913
<i>FROM ENTERTAINING</i>
<i>ALL THOSE SICK KIDS.</i>

00:37.913 --> 00:40.123
<i>(crowd screaming indistinctly)</i>

00:40.123 --> 00:42.084
(circus music playing)

00:42.084 --> 00:44.086
<i>(crowd screaming indistinctly)</i>

00:44.086 --> 00:46.088
UGH! I HAVE BEEN
TO HIS HOUSE.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.090
WHY DOES HE ALWAYS DO THAT?

00:48.090 --> 00:50.092
OKAY, BEFORE I FORGET,
"THE VIEW" CALLED.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.261
THEY WANT YOU
ON THE SHOW TOMORROW.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.471
ALL THIS ATTENTION'S INSANE.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.098
I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT PEOPLE ARE FINALLY SEEING

00:56.098 --> 00:57.724
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.184
HOW IS MOLLY?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.144
GOOD. SHE, UH...
(clears throat)

01:01.144 --> 01:03.397
KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE
THIS MORNING.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.566
SHE SAID
I WAS TOO STRESSED.
(control panel beeps)

01:05.566 --> 01:06.942
I JUST CAN'T HELP IT.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.027
I FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO BE THERE.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.030
WELL, I MADE A PACKET OF WORK
FOR YOU TO TAKE HOME WITH YOU,

01:12.030 --> 01:14.199
AND I WILL BE AVAILABLE
ALL DAY

01:14.199 --> 01:17.202
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE HOUR
THAT I'M MEETING WITH JODIE.
MM. THAT'S RIGHT.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.997
YOUR, UH, Y.E.T.I. INTERVIEWS
START TOMORROW, HUH?

01:19.997 --> 01:21.999
AND WITH SOMEONE LIKE
JODIE PAPADAKIS IN YOUR CORNER,

01:21.999 --> 01:25.544
I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA
END UP WITH SOMETHING GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL SEE.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.546
COME ON, BETTY.
I MEAN, YOU DESERVE THIS.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.173
BELIEVE ME, IF I HAD A JOB
FOR YOU HERE AT "MODE,"

01:30.173 --> 01:33.176
YOU KNOW I'D GIVE IT TO YOU
IN A HEARTBEAT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.804
I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT
LEAVING "MODE" YET, OKAY?

01:35.804 --> 01:38.807
JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME.
WATER.
AH, THERE YOU ARE.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.809
SO, BETTY, WHAT'S IT LIKE
WORKING FOR

01:40.809 --> 01:43.061
THE MOST BELOVED MAN
IN THE CITY?
OH, VERY GLAMOROUS.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.439
SO DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE NEW CITI FIELD?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.190
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA BE
ADVERTISING

01:47.190 --> 01:49.192
ON THE JUMBOTRON, HUH?

01:49.192 --> 01:50.777
TOMORROW NIGHT.
I'M A SPONSOR.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.946
I'VE GOT A LUXURY SUITE
AND TICKETS FOR YOU.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.575
AND THEY'RE FIELD LEVEL.
WOW. MATT'S GONNA LOVE THIS.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.328
YEAH, I'LL DEFINITELY SEE
IF MOLLY'S UP TO IT.
OH, I HOPE SHE IS.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.913
I'VE ARRANGED FOR HER
TO THROW OUT THE FIRST BALL.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.458
THE PRESS WILL EAT THAT UP.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.419
I THINK IT WILL REALLY HELP
PROMOTE THE WEDDING ISSUE.
UH, CAL,

02:07.419 --> 02:10.422
I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE
ASKING MOLLY TO DO THAT.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.300
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THEN YOU DO IT.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.968
(Daniel chuckles)

02:18.096 --> 02:20.891
WHY DOES GOD HATE ME?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.684
I'M A GOOD PERSON.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.978
YOU ARE. AND MORE IMPORTANT,
YOU'RE PRETTY.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.022
FIRST HARTLEY MAKES CLAIRE

02:27.022 --> 02:28.732
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
OF MEADE,

02:28.732 --> 02:32.027
AND NOW DANIEL'S GETTING
ALL THE ATTENTION?

02:32.027 --> 02:33.632
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
GOING ON "THE VIEW."

02:33.632 --> 02:35.238
YOU SHOULD!
THE WEDDING ISSUE IS YOURS.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.240
JUST BECAUSE DUMB DANNY
WAS LUCKY ENOUGH

02:37.240 --> 02:40.077
TO MARRY A WOMAN WITH CANCER,
I HAVE TO TAKE THE BACKSEAT?

02:40.077 --> 02:43.121
IT'S CRIMINAL, WILLIE.
I AM APOPLECTIC.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.666
WILHELMINA, YOU REALLY NEED
TO RETHINK THE COVER

02:45.666 --> 02:47.668
OF THIS WEDDING ISSUE.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.670
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S SAYING.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.171
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE

02:51.171 --> 02:53.715
IT'S SPEAKING A LANGUAGE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND‐‐FASHION.
(chuckles)

02:53.715 --> 02:57.511
IT'S GENERIC.
AND CAL AGREES WITH ME.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.971
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE
SOME OTHER OPTIONS,

02:59.971 --> 03:03.016
AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
PLEASE.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.102
THIS IS...
DISGRACEFUL.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.104
THIS IS...
OUTRAGEOUS.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.939
THIS IS...
UNSPEAKABLY ODIOUS!

03:08.939 --> 03:11.566
OH, MARC.
SORRY.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.903
WHY WOULD HARTLEY GIVE CLAIRE
THAT KIND OF POWER?

03:14.903 --> 03:17.030
THERE'S A CONNECTION THERE.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.116
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT CONNECTION IS

03:19.116 --> 03:22.577
AND RIP IT APART.
(speaking inaudibly)

03:22.577 --> 03:23.954
HI!
HEY.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.580
OOH, YOGURT. YUMMY.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.582
WELL, I FIGURED IT WAS TIME

03:27.582 --> 03:29.543
FOR YOUR POST‐BREAKFAST,
PRE‐LUNCH SLUMP.
IT IS.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.919
AND...
(gasps)

03:30.919 --> 03:32.921
I HAVE
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.923
OH, MY GOSH.
YOUR FIRST PAINTING?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.967
YOU FINISHED IT.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.095
<i>(up‐tempo, sexy music playing)</i>

03:40.095 --> 03:41.972
OH!
<i>(music stops)</i>

03:41.972 --> 03:43.974
IT'S ME... NAKED.

03:43.974 --> 03:47.811
NO, NO, NO. YOU HAVE
A‐A THING OVER YOU.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.188
YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE DRAPED.
OH. HUH.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.816
IT SORTA
LOOKS LIKE I'M NAKED.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.693
WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

03:54.693 --> 03:56.695
NO, I DO. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.155
YOU'RE VERY TALENTED,

03:58.155 --> 04:01.074
BUT... WHY'D YOU
HAVE TO PAINT ME?

04:01.074 --> 04:04.995
BECAUSE YOU INSPIRE ME.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.997
I'M IN YOUR APARTMENT.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.999
MM‐HMM, AND, UH,
AND THAT'S YOUR TOOTHBRUSH

04:08.999 --> 04:11.042
AND, UH, THE YOGURT
YOU LIKE ON THE TABLE...

04:11.042 --> 04:13.837
UH‐HUH.
AND YOUR ROBE
IS ON THE CHAIR.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.840
I SHOULD BE WEARING THAT.
BETTY, I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.842
LOOK, I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE

04:18.842 --> 04:20.844
SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT,

04:20.844 --> 04:23.013
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT I WANT YOU.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.349
AND I SEE A FUTURE FOR US,
TOGETHER.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.394
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARE‐‐ARE YOU ASKING‐‐

04:29.394 --> 04:31.521
MOVE IN WITH ME?

04:31.521 --> 04:34.566
I MEAN, WE ALREADY SPEND
SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER,

04:34.566 --> 04:36.026
AND I LOVE IT.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.196
BUT IT JUST MAKES ME WANT
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU.
UM...

04:39.196 --> 04:42.199
ARE YOU FREAKED OUT?
YOU LOOK FREAKED OUT?
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
I'M NOT FREAKED OUT.
IT‐‐IT‐‐IT'S EXCITING.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.077
IT'S JUST BIG. IT'S BIG.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.080
I KNOW IT IS. I'M JUST ASKING
YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.958
BUT TRY TO THINK
GOOD THINGS.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.877
I WILL.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.965
IT REALLY IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.135
AAH! OH, MY GOD!
THAT IS HIDEOUS!

05:02.135 --> 05:05.138
(gags) IT'S LIKE LOOKING
AT THE BUTT OF SATAN.

05:05.138 --> 05:10.101
OH, MY EYES!
OH! MY EYES. OH!

05:10.101 --> 05:12.103
OPTIONS. (sighs)

05:12.103 --> 05:14.231
OH, THANK YOU,
WILHELMINA.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.526
NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR CHOICE OF STYLIST.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.736
I HAVE A PROBLEM...

05:19.736 --> 05:21.071
(footsteps approach)

05:31.122 --> 05:33.875
HELLO, CLAIRE.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.585
VICTORIA.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.212
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.923
IS IT?

05:39.923 --> 05:43.051
UH, YOU MUST BE
VICTORIA HARTLEY.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.678
I'M WILHELMINA SLATER.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.054
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.557
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M, UH,
MEETING MY EX‐HUSBAND.

05:48.557 --> 05:53.311
I PREFER TO DO THAT BEFORE
MY MUSCLE RELAXER WEARS OFF.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.988
UH, SO YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT MY STYLIST CHOICE?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.949
OH! IT'S FINE.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.076
IT'S FINE.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.292
NORMALLY I DON'T LIKE
OR NOTICE OLDER PEOPLE,

06:15.292 --> 06:17.085
BUT THAT WAS INTERESTING.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.088
HARTLEY'S EX‐WIFE IS CLEARLY
NOT A FAN OF CLAIRE'S.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.924
THAT COULD BE USEFUL.

06:22.924 --> 06:26.720
<i>(pop)</i>
(Jodie) I DON'T WANT TO PUT
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.805
BUT THIS IS
A TOUGH HIRING YEAR.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.349
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BLOW THEM AWAY

06:31.349 --> 06:33.894
THE SECOND
YOU WALK INTO THAT ROOM.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.520
OKAY, GOTTA GO.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.856
JODIE, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR MENTORING ME.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.858
OH, HELL. GET ME
A CAKE OR SOMETHING.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.861
NO, DON'T GET ME A CAKE.
I DON'T EAT CAKE.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.863
GET ME A BOYSENBERRY PIE.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.239
(laughs) OKAY, I WILL.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.241
GOD, I JUST...
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.244
I MEAN, I MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE LEAVING "MODE."

06:51.244 --> 06:53.705
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE IS CHANGING.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.957
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.043
NOW REMEMBER‐‐

06:58.043 --> 07:01.921
WHAT SETS YOU APART
IS WHO YOU ARE.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.923
LET THEM SEE THAT.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.426
THANK YOU.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.888
BETTY... HAS, UM...

07:09.888 --> 07:13.475
HAS... MARC
SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ME?

07:13.475 --> 07:17.687
NO, HE HASN'T, NOT TO ME.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.106
WELL... YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S FINE.

07:20.106 --> 07:24.527
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
WAIT BY THE PHONE?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.989
(laughter)

07:27.989 --> 07:30.825
<i>MIJA,</i> YOU'RE SO QUIET.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.244
YOU WORRIED ABOUT
THE INTERVIEWS TOMORROW?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.205
A LITTLE. UH, BUT I'M...

07:35.205 --> 07:38.208
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU.

07:40.251 --> 07:43.046
MATT ASKED ME
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.423
(silverware clatters
against dishes)

07:45.423 --> 07:47.092
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SUDDEN,

07:47.092 --> 07:49.928
BUT‐‐BUT I TOLD HIM
I WOULD TALK TO YOU FIRST.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.931
AND, <i>PAPI,</i> I'VE BEEN THINKING,
YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.808
AND NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.810
I MEAN, I CAN STILL HELP OUT.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.105
AND‐‐AND MATT LOVES IT HERE,
SO WE'LL BE HERE ALL THE TIME.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.943
WELL, THEN I THINK...

08:04.943 --> 08:07.112
I THINK IT'S FINE.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.322
(Justin, Hilda and Betty)
REALLY?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.324
WHAT, YOU CAN GROW
AND I CAN'T?

08:11.324 --> 08:15.328
I GET IT. MY GIRLS
HAVE LIVES OF THEIR OWN.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.998
(lowered voice)
THOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND

08:18.998 --> 08:22.001
WHY NO ONE'S TALKED
ABOUT MARRIAGE FIRST.

08:22.001 --> 08:26.589
WOW, LOOK AT YOU,
LIVING WITH A RICH GUY.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.216
HILDA, STOP.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.218
DOES HE HAVE A MAID?
(laughter)

08:31.720 --> 08:33.722
(Matt) Wait,
so you're saying yes?

08:33.722 --> 08:36.307
I'M SAYING YES.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.601
I'M <i>SO</i> GLAD.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.730
I ALREADY PAINTED THE KITCHEN
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.
(gasps) YELLOW?!

08:41.730 --> 08:43.690
UH‐OH.
I THOUGHT IT WAS PURPLE.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.943
OH, I LIKE PURPLE.
PURPLE'S A NICE COLOR, TOO.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.945
YOU ARE, LIKE,
THE WORST LIAR.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.947
OF COURSE
I PAINTED IT YELLOW.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.240
(chuckles)

08:52.240 --> 08:54.325
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT ARE YOU‐‐
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

08:54.325 --> 08:56.327
JUST THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY.

"BRADFORD NEEDS TO SEE YOU
IN HIS OFFICE IMMEDIATELY."

09:55.804 --> 09:58.181
ANY OTHER MESSAGES,
LIKE, FROM THIS YEAR,

09:58.181 --> 10:00.934
LIKE, FROM <i>ALIVE</i> PEOPLE?

10:00.934 --> 10:03.937
"MARC, LET'S TRY AGAIN.
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. TOBY."

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
MANDY, THIS IS
FROM SIX MONTHS AGO.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.109
HONESTLY, I DID YOU A FAVOR.
HE HAD THAT AWFUL RED HAIR.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.945
ARE YOU SURE I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER MESSAGES?

10:11.945 --> 10:15.657
<i>YES.</i> THAT IS IT. WHY ARE YOU
ALL UP IN MY GRUNDLE?

10:15.657 --> 10:17.784
I JUST SAW HENRY
GET INTO A CAB.
(gasps)

10:17.784 --> 10:20.161
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS HIM?

10:20.161 --> 10:21.830
BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY NORMAL

10:21.830 --> 10:23.832
TO THINK YOU SEE PEOPLE
AFTER THEY DIE.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.834
MANDY, HENRY DIDN'T DIE.
HE JUST DUMPED BETTY

10:25.834 --> 10:27.794
AND MOVED TO TUCSON
TO RAISE HIS BASTARD CHILD

10:27.794 --> 10:29.796
WITH HIS SLUTTY
EX‐GIRLFRIEND.
OH, COOL.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.798
WHY WOULD HE BE HERE?
HEY, IF HE CALLS,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802
THAT YOU'RE OUT
OR THAT YOU'RE BUSY

10:35.802 --> 10:38.513
OR THAT THE TRIBE
OF MOLE PEOPLE

10:38.513 --> 10:40.014
KIDNAPPED YOU
AND MADE YOU THEIR QUEEN?

10:40.014 --> 10:41.516
COULD YOU PLEASE JUST
PUT HIM THROUGH? THANKS.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.904
PERSONALLY, I RECOMMEND
THE DARK ONE

12:17.904 --> 12:20.907

YOU KNOW, I GOT
MY FIRST SUBSCRIPTION

13:57.587 --> 14:00.423
TO THE "NEW YORK REVIEW"
WHEN I WAS 7.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.800
JOHN CHEEVER WAS ON THE COVER,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.802
AND‐‐AND THERE WAS
AN ARTICLE ABOUT ESTONIA

14:04.802 --> 14:07.805
AND‐‐AND HOW THE KROON HAD JUST
REPLACED THE SOVIET RUBEL.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.849
I WASN'T REALLY LIKE
OTHER KIDS.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.226
I ADMIT,
SOMETIMES THAT WAS HARD,

14:12.226 --> 14:15.605
BUT I DID ALWAYS HAVE
MY MAGAZINES.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.648
AND THE "NEW YORK REVIEW"

14:17.648 --> 14:20.610
TOOK ME OUT OF
MY LITTLE CORNER IN QUEENS,

14:20.610 --> 14:24.113
HELPED ME IMAGINE
A MUCH BIGGER WORLD.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.115
I JUST REALLY HOPE
THAT ONE DAY,

14:26.115 --> 14:29.911
I CAN GIVE SOMEONE ELSE
THAT GIFT.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.121
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.755
(door closes)

14:40.755 --> 14:43.382
(exhales deeply) OKAY.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.844
(singsong voice) I'M TELLING
YOU, THEY LOVED YOU!

14:46.844 --> 14:49.055
REALLY?
(normal voice)
YOU EVEN GOT A SMILE

14:49.055 --> 14:50.890
FROM THAT WOMAN
FROM "HARPER'S,"

14:50.890 --> 14:53.267
AND SHE RECENTLY HAD
SEVERAL DEATHS IN HER FAMILY.
OH.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.602
UM...

14:54.602 --> 14:56.562
DID ANYONE LOVE ME?

14:56.562 --> 14:59.357
TO BE HONEST,
THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE SELFISH.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.151
THEY WERE HURT
YOU NEVER CALLED BACK.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.945
(grunts)

15:03.945 --> 15:05.947
MARC,
JODIE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.949
SHE'S NOT GONNA
SABOTAGE YOUR CAREER.
(sighs)

15:07.949 --> 15:10.326
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.953
OH, IT WAS AWFUL.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.330
THERE WERE KISSES AND BOOBS
AND LOTS OF TEARS.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.333
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
HOW DID IT GO?

15:17.333 --> 15:20.294
TERRIBLE!
OH, THANK GOD.
I CAN'T LOSE YOU GUYS.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.922
MARC, IT WOULD BE LIKE
LOSING MY SOUL MATE.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.299
AND, BETTY, IT WOULD BE
LIKE LOSING AN ELDERLY AUNT

15:25.299 --> 15:28.302
THAT I'M SORT OF FOND OF.
WELL, YOU WON'T
HAVE TO SUFFER YET.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.304
WE WON'T KNOW TILL TOMORROW.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.641
HEY, LOOK.
THERE'S CAFé BLINI.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.561
HENRY'S PROBABLY STILL THERE.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.147
WE COULD DROP IN AND SAY HI.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.650
THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT, RIGHT?
WHAT AM I SAYING?

15:42.650 --> 15:45.236
HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT ME
TO KNOW HE WAS IN NEW YORK.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.905
I COULD TAKE A PEEK. A PEEK?
WHAT AM I, LIKE, 5?

15:47.905 --> 15:50.867
MARC, WHAT SHOULD I DO?
MAKE UP YOUR MIND, WOMAN!

15:50.867 --> 15:53.911
I HAVE. I'M NOT GOING.
LET'S GO.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.871
HENRY!

15:54.871 --> 15:56.831
HI, BETTY.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.125

15:59.125 --> 16:01.085
I'M CHLOE.
I'M HENRY'S GIRLFRIEND.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.764
FINALLY I GET TO MEET
HENRY'S FRIENDS.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.601
I'VE BEEN BEGGING HIM
TO TAKE ME UP TO "MODE."
WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.039
ARE YOU DYING?
YOU MUST BE DYING.

16:18.039 --> 16:19.478
SO WHAT BROUGHT YOU
TO NEW YORK?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.085
UH, CHLOE'S HERE

16:22.085 --> 16:24.692

MY AFFA CERTIFICATION.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.068

16:26.068 --> 16:28.321
THERE'S A PRACTICAL
<i>AND</i> A WRITTEN.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.697

16:29.697 --> 16:31.574
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
THE NEW‐AND‐IMPROVED HENRY.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.660

SHOW US THOSE GUNS.
NO, I'M NOT MAKING A MUSCLE.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.663
OH, MY GOD.
JUST‐‐OW.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.166
HE WAS STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE BIT OF A POT,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.752
BUT I WAS LIKE,
"NO, NOT ON MY WATCH."

16:42.752 --> 16:44.712
(Marc laughs) AWW.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.340
SO, BETTY,
WE HAVE TO HAVE DINNER.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.342
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
OH, NO, I CAN'T TONIGHT.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.385
I'M‐‐I'M GONNA GO WATCH
A METS GAME.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.180
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO
THE NEW CITI FIELD.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.183

OH, YOU SAY THAT EVERY TIME.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.587
VICTORIA,

17:26.587 --> 17:29.757
WILHELMINA, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE A MEMBER.
WELL, I JUST JOINED,

17:29.757 --> 17:33.678
AND GO FIGURE‐‐MY FIRST DAY,
AND MY PARTNER DOESN'T SHOW.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.680
OH, IT'D BE A SHAME
TO LOSE YOUR COURT.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.682
I'M ALWAYS UP FOR A GAME.
ARE YOU ANY GOOD?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.684
BECAUSE THIS ONE?
SHE DOESN'T EVEN TRY ANYMORE.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.103
I HAVE TO LET YOU WIN,
OR YOU POUT.

WAS A LITTLE HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.411
LET'S‐‐LET'S JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT, OKAY?

28:24.411 --> 28:25.662
OKAY.

28:25.662 --> 28:29.374
YOU, UH, STILL WANT
TO MOVE IN, RIGHT?

28:29.374 --> 28:32.920
YES, YES, OF COURSE.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.588
MM.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.715
(rainfall)

28:36.715 --> 28:38.717
LET'S GET OUT OF
THIS RAIN, HMM?

28:38.717 --> 28:39.927

AH, EXCUSE ME.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.421
(ring)

29:16.421 --> 29:17.422
(beep)

29:17.422 --> 29:19.091
(sighs) CLAIRE MEADE.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.386
LEAVE ME ALONE,
YOU PILL‐POPPING HAG.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.972
OH. (laughs) I'M SORRY.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.016
THAT WAS
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.019
CLAIRE AND I HAVE
A... COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.063
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.023
THAT BITCH ALMOST RUINED
MY MARRIAGE.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.692
I MEAN, BEFORE I DID.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.945
WHOA. OKAY, I HAVE HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.947
(laughs) WELL, VICTORIA,

29:41.947 --> 29:44.157
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TELL ME MORE.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.325
(chuckles)

29:45.325 --> 29:49.246
OH, GOD. (inhales sharply)
OH, IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.374
AND, YOU KNOW, AT FIRST,
WE WERE ALL SO CLOSE‐‐

29:52.374 --> 29:54.793
THE MEADES AND THE HARTLEYS.

29:54.793 --> 29:59.339
UNFORTUNATELY, CAL AND CLAIRE
GOT A LITTLE TOO CLOSE.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.924
OH, YOU POOR THING.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.676
THERE WAS AN AFFAIR?

30:02.676 --> 30:05.679
WORSE.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.515
THERE WAS A BABY.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.691
(Hilda) I DON'T KNOW, BETTY.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.693
MOVING IN WITH MATT'S
A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.695
HOW COULD IT JUST
NOT COME UP?

30:21.695 --> 30:23.697
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.073
WAS MATT RIGHT?

30:25.073 --> 30:28.660
WAS I TRYING TO LEAVE
SOME DOOR OPEN FOR HENRY?

30:28.660 --> 30:31.288
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN ANSWER THAT.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.206
I LOVE MATT. I DO.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.834
IT'S JUST,
WHEN I SAW HENRY...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.836
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.379
MM.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.381
IT TOOK ME RIGHT BACK
TO THAT PLACE‐‐

30:41.381 --> 30:44.384
THE WAY I USED TO FEEL
WHEN I SAW HIM,

30:44.384 --> 30:46.386
THOSE SAME BUTTERFLIES
IN MY STOMACH.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.347
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE PAIN YOU FELT, TOO?

30:49.347 --> 30:50.932
'CAUSE I DO.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.061
ALL I'M SAYING IS...

30:54.061 --> 30:56.063
BEFORE HENRY CAME ALONG,

30:56.063 --> 30:58.732
YOU WERE SO EXCITED
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH MATT.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.734
I STILL AM.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.736
THEN REMIND YOURSELF
OF SOMETHING.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.072
HENRY ISN'T REAL.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.074
HE LIVES 2,000 MILES AWAY.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.077
HE'S GOT A KID.
HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.287
(chuckles) TRUST ME,
JUST BECAUSE A GUY

31:12.287 --> 31:13.914
MAKES YOUR HEART FLUTTER

31:13.914 --> 31:16.750
DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE WITH THEM.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.711
I'M NOT SAYING I WANT TO BE
WITH HIM. I'M WITH MATT.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.672
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SCREW THAT UP.

31:22.672 --> 31:25.675
OKAY, THEN...
DON'T SEE HENRY AGAIN.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.677
(Daniel) I'M SORRY.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.180
I... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.182
HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO OUT WITH HER.

31:32.182 --> 31:35.143
(laughing) I MEAN,
YOU ALREADY HAVE A FUNNY STORY

31:35.143 --> 31:37.521
TO BREAK THE ICE.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.689
NOW SEE? THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.692
WHEN YOU DO THAT, CAN YOU BLAME
ME FOR JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS?

31:42.692 --> 31:44.694
YOU KEEP MAKING
THESE COMMENTS

31:44.694 --> 31:47.280
ABOUT ME
BEING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.867
I'M SORRY. I KNOW
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR YOU.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.869
FOR EITHER OF US, MOLLY.

31:52.869 --> 31:57.249
THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT
IS THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.209
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.545
I DON'T WANT YOU
WORRYING FOR ONE SECOND

32:01.545 --> 32:03.713
ABOUT ME BEING LONELY
OR ANYTHING.

32:03.713 --> 32:07.342
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I MAKE
ALL THOSE STUPID JOKES?

32:07.342 --> 32:09.344
(crying)
BECAUSE I AM TRYING

32:09.344 --> 32:14.808
TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND
THE WORST THING I CAN IMAGINE...

32:14.808 --> 32:17.727
THAT I WILL DIE,

32:17.727 --> 32:19.688
AND YOU WILL MEET SOMEONE

32:19.688 --> 32:22.649
AND MOVE ON AND FORGET ME.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.860
MOLLY...

32:24.860 --> 32:27.863
THAT'S THE THING
I'M MOST AFRAID OF...

32:27.863 --> 32:30.866
THAT THE WORLD
WILL JUST GO ON WITHOUT ME,

32:30.866 --> 32:33.869
AND EVERYONE WILL FORGET
I WAS HERE.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.668
I PROMISE YOU...

32:41.668 --> 32:45.547
I WILL NEVER,
EVER FORGET YOU.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.800
(exhales deeply)

32:59.853 --> 33:01.229
(Betty) HI, JODIE.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.149
I'M LEAVING YOU
ANOTHER MESSAGE. SORRY.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.444
BUT I‐I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM THE "NEW YORK REVIEW" YET.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.446
CALL ME. UM, OKAY.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.448
BYE.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.910
(sighs)

33:18.079 --> 33:20.415
(clicks computer mouse, beep)

33:22.542 --> 33:23.877
(click)

33:23.877 --> 33:26.213
(beep)

33:29.466 --> 33:31.468
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.

33:31.468 --> 33:34.804
I GOT THREE OFFERS. (scoffs)
IT'S A TOTAL BIDDING WAR.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.473
IT'S LIKE I'M YENTL,

33:36.473 --> 33:37.849
AND MANDY PATINKIN,
AMY IRVING AND THE TALMUD

33:37.849 --> 33:40.352
ARE ALL VYING
FOR MY ATTENTION.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.478
OH.

33:41.478 --> 33:42.771
WOW.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.649
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.318
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?

33:48.318 --> 33:51.321
UM... WELL, I GUESS
I CAN TELL YOU.

33:51.321 --> 33:54.324
JODIE CALLED ME YESTERDAY,
AND THE "NEW YORK REVIEW"

33:54.324 --> 33:57.160
IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME
AN OFFER TODAY, BUT‐‐

33:57.160 --> 33:59.829
<i>OH, I KNEW</i> YOU GOT AN OFFER!
I GOT NOTHING, <i>NOTHING.</i>

33:59.829 --> 34:00.997
WHAT?

34:00.997 --> 34:02.999
I LIED
TO GET YOU TO TALK.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.877
NOBODY WANTS ME, BETTY.
NOBODY'S CALLED.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.505
AND I GAVE SUCH A GOOD INTERVIEW
AT "VOGUE."

34:08.505 --> 34:09.881
(sighs)

34:09.881 --> 34:12.801
MARC, YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.804
DON'T! MY FLESH ROTS
WHERE YOU TOUCH IT.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.806
IT'S JUST THAT
I WANTED IT SO MUCH.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.726
AND... (sighs)
I WORKED SO HARD.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.687
AND I WOULD'VE MADE

34:23.687 --> 34:26.523
THE BEST JUNIOR EDITOR
"VOGUE" HAS EVER SEEN.

34:26.523 --> 34:29.776
YEAH. YOU WOULD.

34:29.776 --> 34:32.529
THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.239
WHY DON'T YOU CALL 'EM?

34:34.239 --> 34:38.952
TELL THEM
JUST WHO MARC ST. JAMES IS.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.162
WHAT DO YOU GOT TO LOSE?

34:41.162 --> 34:43.248
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.504
IF THEY'RE GONNA REJECT ME,

34:49.504 --> 34:51.923
THEN THEY HAVE TO
TELL ME WHY.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.890
THANKS.

35:00.890 --> 35:04.686
(chair wheels clatter)

35:08.940 --> 35:12.819
(clicks keypad buttons)

35:17.282 --> 35:20.827
HI. UM...
THIS IS BETTY SUAREZ.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.288
UH, I INTERVIEWED WITH ERIKA,

35:23.288 --> 35:25.665
AND I WAS WONDERING IF...

35:27.334 --> 35:29.878
OH.

35:29.878 --> 35:33.256
OH, UH...

35:33.256 --> 35:37.844
WELL, DO YOU MIND
ME ASKING WHY?

35:40.096 --> 35:42.098
YOU STOLE MY JOB?

35:48.271 --> 35:50.732
I DIDN'T STEAL IT.

35:50.732 --> 35:53.151
I JUST CONVINCED THEM
TO HIRE ME INSTEAD.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.445
YEAH, THAT'S
SORT OF LIKE STEALING.

35:55.445 --> 35:58.865
PLEASE DON'T SHOUT.
I WAS IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.161
ALL I DID WAS GIVE THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY

36:03.161 --> 36:05.789
TO HIRE ME
AT A VERY REDUCED SALARY.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.792
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
IT STILL ATE INTO THE BUDGET

36:08.792 --> 36:11.294
FOR THE TWO
JUNIOR EDITOR POSITIONS.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.672
ONE OF WHICH
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MINE!

36:13.672 --> 36:15.298
I'M SORRY, BETTY.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.301
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
TO SIT BACK

36:18.301 --> 36:19.928
AND WATCH SOME
CHEERY 20‐SOMETHING

36:19.928 --> 36:21.930
JUST WALTZ IN AND TAKE

36:21.930 --> 36:23.932
WHAT I DREAMED OF
MY WHOLE CAREER?

36:23.932 --> 36:27.352
JODIE, YOU WERE MY HERO.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.647
I IDOLIZED YOU.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.027
IT'S BEEN A CRAPPY YEAR.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.655
I LOST MY 401(k),

36:38.655 --> 36:40.657
MY CAT DIED,

36:40.657 --> 36:42.742
AND I'M HITTING ON GAY GUYS,

36:42.742 --> 36:44.744
AND I AM JUST SO TIRED

36:44.744 --> 36:48.832
OF HELPING OTHER PEOPLE
GET WHAT THEY WANT.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.084
WHO SAID I'M DONE?

36:53.044 --> 36:55.171
I GUESS YOU AREN'T.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.555
HEY, WILLIE.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.890
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.851
MY ENTIRE BODY
HAS TENNIS ELBOW,

37:07.851 --> 37:11.604
I HAVE A HANGOVER THAT'S WORTHY
OF A COLLEGE FRESHMAN,

37:11.604 --> 37:14.524
BUT I'M FEELING WONDERFUL,

37:14.524 --> 37:16.901
BECAUSE I HAVE INFORMATION
THAT WILL SPLIT UP

37:16.901 --> 37:19.821
OLD MAN HARTLEY
AND GRANDMA MEADE.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.991
OH, MARC. I'M HAPPY.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.784
WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE

37:24.784 --> 37:26.786
YOUR FEELINGS
ARE DIFFERENT THAN MINE?

37:26.786 --> 37:28.371
UH...

37:28.371 --> 37:32.125
I GUESS BECAUSE OF
MY Y.E.T.I. INTERVIEWS.

37:32.125 --> 37:35.378
OH. YOU DIDN'T GET
ANY OFFERS?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.589
WELL,
TIMES ARE TOUGH, DARLING.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.383
JUST BE GRATEFUL
YOU HAVE A JOB.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.803

37:58.067 --> 38:00.069

38:00.069 --> 38:04.616
