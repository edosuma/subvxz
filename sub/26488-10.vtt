No-- babe, there's no four.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.691
[laughs]:
There's always a four.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.476
Stop counting. Just feel it.I can't stop counting.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.086
I'm a numbers person.
Ah.

One...Tango is not math.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.616
It's sex.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.835
Well, I appreciate that,

04:30.879 --> 04:32.663
but right now,
this feels like math.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.100
No, no, no.
Mm...

04:35.144 --> 04:36.450
Okay.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.627

Ah.

This one understands.

04:56.383 --> 05:01.997
Ah, well, maybe you should dance
with Esmeralda at the ceremony.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.260
What ceremony?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.828
We're renewing our vows.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.396
Ah. This is an American thing.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.354
Well...Why do you do these things?

05:11.398 --> 05:14.183
Well, we never really got
the wedding we wanted.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.577
I was about to deploy
to the Marines and, uh,

05:16.620 --> 05:19.319
well, uh--
can-can we take a water break?

05:19.362 --> 05:20.755
Yes.
Okay.

05:20.798 --> 05:23.061
Great, hey-- yeah, we just
sort of rushed it a little.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.412
We didn't get
exactly what we wanted.Well...

05:25.455 --> 05:26.674
I wanted a church wedding,

05:26.717 --> 05:28.153
ELIZABETH:
I wanted the dress

05:28.197 --> 05:30.895
and my bridesmaids and the...

05:30.939 --> 05:33.724
I know, the veil...Yeah, and I wanted
the first dance to be a tango.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.292
And I wanted it to be
"Baby, I Love Your Way,"

05:36.336 --> 05:38.076
because that's the
best song ever,

05:38.120 --> 05:41.471
but, oh, anyway, we
didn't get any of that.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.605
What we got was
a cranky judge at city hall.

We did get that,
and three lovely kids.Mm-hmm.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.874
Aw, so when is the big day?

05:52.917 --> 05:55.311
Well, the day we picked actually
has a lot of significance.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.444
The-the hour and the minute
we picked has significance, too.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.708
Because it was the minute that
we both knew, simultaneously,

06:00.751 --> 06:02.797
without telling each other,
that we were getting married.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.973
Aw.
We checked the time:
8:22 p.m.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.844
Yep. It was actually
this joke that I told

06:06.888 --> 06:08.933
that was what sealed the deal.[laughs]

06:08.977 --> 06:11.458
[laughter]ELIZABETH:
So funny.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.678
My favorite joke. No one had
ever laughed at it that hard.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.289
Well, I suppose
I have to hear it.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.421
No, I promise,
it'll kill you.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.075
Well, babe, don't oversell it.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.512
I mean, it's pretty good, but...You can't oversell it.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.385
Okay, well, I need a,
I need a visual aid.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.430
[phone ringing]Oh, no. Oh, crud.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.866
It's Jay.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.825
Don't-don't tell it
without me. Hold on.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.479
Hey, Jay, what's up?

06:32.522 --> 06:33.915
JAY:
Sorry to bother, ma'am.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.177
I know you're in that lesson.

06:35.220 --> 06:39.311
Yeah, no, that's fine.
What do you got?

06:39.355 --> 06:42.880
Uh, an earful from the Mexican
deputy foreign minister.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.969
They're wavering
on the border security deal.

06:45.013 --> 06:48.451
Why? I just talked to
President Zaragoza this morning.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.757
And this afternoon,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.020
Arizona governor Barker
implemented a new policy

06:52.063 --> 06:54.457
of separating children
from parents

06:54.501 --> 06:55.545
who illegally cross the border

06:55.589 --> 06:57.417
into the state.W-Wait.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.637
They're separating children
from their parents?

07:00.681 --> 07:01.682
I know.

07:01.725 --> 07:02.683
It's crazy.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.249
Okay, aside from

07:04.293 --> 07:09.777
all the obvious questions of
humanity, decency and shame,

07:09.820 --> 07:13.345
how can they even do that
without blatantly encroaching

07:13.389 --> 07:15.043
on federal immigration law?

07:15.086 --> 07:18.481
They probably can't, but
Arizona recently passed a law

07:18.525 --> 07:21.919
authorizing state police to, uh,
temporarily detain anyone

07:21.963 --> 07:23.399
who fails to provide
documentation

07:23.443 --> 07:25.053
of lawful presence
in the country.

07:25.096 --> 07:27.229
Until now,
that's meant a few hours

07:27.272 --> 07:28.448
before turning them
over to the feds.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.536
And now?

07:29.579 --> 07:30.754
Governor's office

07:30.798 --> 07:33.235
is claiming weeks,
months in some cases.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.237
I'm gonna kill Governor Barker.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.847
I mean, talk to him.

07:36.891 --> 07:37.848
First, at least.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.328
White House has already

07:39.371 --> 07:41.548
set up a call and invited State
to join in half an hour.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.766
Okay, good. Good.

07:42.810 --> 07:43.985
If you want
to finish the lesson,

07:44.028 --> 07:45.769
I could handle it.No, no, no.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.772
I-- no. Um, I'm on my way
in just a few minutes.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.165
And you go enjoy your evening.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.558
Thank you, ma'am.Bye.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.604
Jay-man. You here for
the 9:00 game, too?

07:54.648 --> 07:56.258
Win, hey.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.739
Uh, yeah, maybe.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.610
Man, this is such
a coincidence.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.917
I literally just got out of a
meeting with Rob Phelps who said

08:02.960 --> 08:05.746
that I should get a sit-down
with your boss, or you.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.182
Well, we're pretty busy.Saving the world.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.184
Love it. And hey,
you could save it a lot faster

08:09.227 --> 08:10.533
if the government
legalizes marijuana.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.013
[laughs]: Okay. We'll
keep that in mind.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.971
Love it. Oh, hey, I could swing
by your office tomorrow,

08:14.015 --> 08:15.190
we could grab lunch.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.931
DALTON:
Are you really separating

08:16.974 --> 08:18.541
children from their parents?

08:18.585 --> 08:20.543
RICHARD:
It's called enforcing the law.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.545
[chuckles]: You ought to try it
some time, Mr. President.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.894
Oh, you can count on
the attorney general and me

08:23.938 --> 08:25.113
enforcing the law.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.289
Your law isn't Arizona law.

08:27.332 --> 08:30.945
It is when you encroach on
federal immigration policy.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.861
My AG tells me
I'm on firm legal ground.

08:33.904 --> 08:37.125
ELIZABETH: But Governor,
forget the legal argument.

08:37.168 --> 08:40.128
Your new policy,
besides being inhumane,

08:40.171 --> 08:42.217
is already jeopardizing

08:42.260 --> 08:44.219
our border security deal
with Mexico.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.221
A deal that your state

08:46.264 --> 08:48.615
stands to gain from.Says who?

08:48.658 --> 08:51.748
I say it will endanger
the good people of Arizona.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.750
After that shameful
immigration debacle

08:53.794 --> 08:56.840
you people jammed through
Congress last summer,

08:56.884 --> 08:58.842
you forced my hand here.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.888
Governor, if you're trying
to kill the border deal...

09:00.931 --> 09:03.586
I am trying to deter
future illegals.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.502
If it spoils your little deal,
all the better.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.940
Okay, I'm sorry. Y-You're taking
children from their parents

09:09.984 --> 09:11.812
as a deterrent?

09:11.855 --> 09:13.161
Someone had to grow
a pair, ma'am.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.597
Do I really have
to explain to you

09:14.641 --> 09:17.078
how barbaric
and un-American that is?

09:17.121 --> 09:20.037
If you're gonna make deals with
Mexico, you got to be tough.

09:20.081 --> 09:24.651
Now, I'll consider backing off
the separation policy

09:24.694 --> 09:27.001
if you get
lower immigration caps,

09:27.044 --> 09:29.960
higher thresholds
for asylum seekers

09:30.004 --> 09:34.182
and Mexican support for
construction of a border wall.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.924
You don't get to call
the shots here, Governor.

09:36.967 --> 09:41.363
You don't get to call
the shots here in Arizona.

09:41.406 --> 09:42.930
We're done.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.932
Son of a bitch
hung up on me.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.543
[scoffs] Trying
to leverage us.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.153
[sighs]

09:49.197 --> 09:52.069
How do we leverage back?
Hell, how do we level him?

09:52.113 --> 09:56.160
Sir, the underlying Arizona
statute was carefully drafted

09:56.204 --> 09:58.946
to sit right on the line of what
Arizona can get away with

09:58.989 --> 10:01.383
without getting preempted
by federal law.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.950
So where does that leave us?

10:02.993 --> 10:04.952
Well, there is a strong
argument that the statute

10:04.995 --> 10:06.344
is unconstitutional as applied.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.956
DOJ is putting together
a challenge of the policy

10:08.999 --> 10:10.697
as a violation
of the supremacy clause.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.177
Good. I would think
the Constitution

10:13.221 --> 10:15.702
would be on our side here.Yeah,
we'll also argue

10:15.745 --> 10:18.139
the policy is a violation
of the due process

10:18.182 --> 10:20.750
and equal protection clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.012
What's the bottom line, Hank?

10:22.056 --> 10:26.103
Well, like Russell said,
the law's on our side,

10:26.147 --> 10:28.715
but these court challenges
will take time.

10:28.758 --> 10:32.327
Unless we try
for a preliminary injunction

10:32.370 --> 10:34.111
to halt the policy.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.939
Any downside to that?

10:35.983 --> 10:38.812
[sighs]
We lose, publicly.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.684
I can live with that.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.034
I can't live with
letting this go unchecked.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.080
I'll get into it.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.214
[sighs heavily]

10:53.304 --> 10:55.219
I want other options.

10:55.263 --> 10:58.005
We need to attack this
on as many fronts as possible.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.965
Well, what about a
legislative solution?

11:02.009 --> 11:03.532
We choke off
federal funding

11:03.575 --> 11:06.448
to Arizona until the families
are back together

11:06.491 --> 11:08.363
and this policy is revoked.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.235
Bring Governor Barker to heel.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.237
I like the sound of that, too,

11:13.281 --> 11:14.891
but how do we
get the votes?

11:14.935 --> 11:19.069
Well, I can talk to
Senator Morejon.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.724
RUSSELL:
Anti-immigration champion?

11:21.768 --> 11:25.859
Leader of the Squash
Elizabeth McCord Club Morejon?

11:25.902 --> 11:29.645
The man's a senior senator
from Arizona.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.212
Do you really think
he'd go against

11:31.255 --> 11:33.693
his own state's
government?
We've worked
together before.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.564
Landmines, a while back.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.480
I've seen his
softer side.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.091
And if you get Morejon,
you think he can deliver

11:41.135 --> 11:43.267
his anti-immigration
caucus?

11:43.311 --> 11:47.315
He is senior senator from
Arizona, gives him standing.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.753
Every second this policy
remains in place

11:50.797 --> 11:53.800
is an affront
to basic human dignity.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.280
And a national disgrace.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.804
Go get 'em, Bess.

No. Win.
Seriously, dude.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.820
Cannabis meds are state
of the art for pain management.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
Well, hey, okay. I'll take that
under consideration.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.259
I'm gonna hold you
to that. And listen,

13:02.303 --> 13:05.654
while I have you,
did you ever consider

13:05.697 --> 13:08.700
that legalization of marijuana
is the best way for the U.S.

13:08.744 --> 13:09.919
to weaken the Mexican cartels

13:09.963 --> 13:11.791
and stem the flow of
drugs across the border?

13:11.834 --> 13:13.967
Did you just trip me on purpose
so you could lobby me?

13:14.010 --> 13:16.752
Dude, of course not.
I'm on your team.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.146
Not tonight. But
I got your back.Oh, my...

13:19.189 --> 13:22.236
It's just I know
M-Sec is looking to make

13:22.279 --> 13:23.672
a border security
deal with Mexico,

13:23.715 --> 13:25.805
and legalization is the
pathway to security.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.024
If you want, I can introduce
you to some really good...No, don't want. Don't want.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.417
Stop lobbying me.My bad. My bad.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.071
All right? I'll
call you tomorrow.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.550
No.I'll send you a white
paper on cannabis.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.770
Win, go away.All right, cool. Yeah.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.163
Say hi to Daisy.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.208
Who's got next?

13:39.557 --> 13:41.951
MAYFIELD:
Mr. Bramble, I've reviewed

13:41.995 --> 13:44.040
your application
for a preliminary injunction.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.781
Thank you, Your Honor.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.174
Arizona's policy

13:47.217 --> 13:49.045
of forcibly separating
parents and children...

13:49.089 --> 13:51.961
Yes, yes. You're arguing
the supremacy clause.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.790
But an injunction
is extraordinary relief.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.227
But we believe our likelihood
of success on the merits...

13:57.271 --> 13:58.968
I'd like to hear from
the attorney general of Arizona.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.884
The likelihood
is slim, Your Honor.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.321
The Arizona policy at issue
was narrowly crafted

14:04.365 --> 14:05.627
to comport with federal law.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.498
It flies in the face
of federal law,

14:07.542 --> 14:09.674
Your Honor.Reasonable minds can disagree.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.287
I think we need
a full adjudication here.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.550
The bigger issue
is the irreparable harm

14:15.593 --> 14:17.726
posed to the minors
who are subjected

14:17.769 --> 14:20.250
to this draconian decree.Hysterics, Judge.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.643
It's a temporary displacement

14:21.686 --> 14:22.818
of children from
their parents.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.080
The duration
of the separation

14:24.124 --> 14:26.387
is not the issue.
The fact of it is.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.042
Children are legally separated
from their parents all the time.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.044
When the parents are imprisoned.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.567
Uh, when they are placed

14:32.610 --> 14:33.873
in foster care.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.136
After an adjudication
and due process, yes.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.225
I'm curious to see you here,

14:38.268 --> 14:39.661
Mr. Jackson.

14:39.704 --> 14:43.056
This is a pressing matter
for the administration.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.101
Pressing enough
for a presidential emissary

14:45.145 --> 14:46.668
to appear at counsel's table?

14:46.711 --> 14:49.410
I am a licensed attorney, Judge.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.413
And the president's
chief of staff.

14:52.456 --> 14:56.112
Don't think I don't recognize
intimidation when I see it.

14:56.156 --> 14:59.246
[scoffs]It's a shameful abuse

14:59.289 --> 15:00.856
of executive power.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.642
Judge, the stakes of
Arizona's decision

15:04.686 --> 15:06.253
to flout federal policy...

15:06.296 --> 15:08.777
Can be decided at trial.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.170
The government's motion

15:10.213 --> 15:12.389
for a preliminary injunction
is denied.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.305
Thank you, Your Honor.Judge, there are six more
arguments in our brief.

15:15.349 --> 15:18.004
None of which
merited consideration.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.268
I think, given the
enormity of the issue...

15:21.311 --> 15:23.574
Mr. Bramble,
you are counsel of record,

15:23.618 --> 15:26.447
not Mr. Jackson,
so either muzzle him,

15:26.490 --> 15:28.014
or he can consider
his impertinence

15:28.057 --> 15:30.233
during his night in lockup.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.800
[gavel bangs]

15:31.843 --> 15:34.237
Dismissed.All rise.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.417
Thank you.Yeah.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.028
This is highly irregular,
Mr. Jackson.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.508
I don't countenance
ex parte communications.

15:44.552 --> 15:48.034
It's not ex parte, Your Honor.
I'm not here to talk substance.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.471
I'm busy, Mr. Jackson.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.823
Too busy to be
fair-minded?

15:54.866 --> 15:57.782
Excuse me?

15:57.826 --> 16:00.742
Look... you know the
stakes of this case.

16:00.785 --> 16:04.615
For the children. For U.S.
policy. For the country.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.662
None of that concerns me.
Only the law does.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.056
The law which you
short-circuited

16:10.099 --> 16:12.014
by ignoring six
of our arguments.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.321
I'd like to know why.

16:17.367 --> 16:20.196
I was short-listed
by the last administration

16:20.240 --> 16:22.982
for an appellate seat years ago.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.288
You know why
I still haven't gotten it?

16:25.332 --> 16:28.161
Because the obstructive
Dalton administration

16:28.204 --> 16:31.294
found me not
to its ideological liking.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.731
Your president,
Elizabeth McCord,

16:33.775 --> 16:36.299
your whole cohort
is contemptuous

16:36.343 --> 16:37.866
of American values.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.129
But you don't represent
the majority.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.350
You represent a soon-to-be
disempowered minority

16:43.393 --> 16:44.829
clinging to power

16:44.873 --> 16:48.224
and bent on flushing
this country down the sewer.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.314
But the only thing that's going
to be flushed on my watch...

16:51.358 --> 16:53.577
is you.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.102
Now get out.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.546
Let me look
into Mr. Whitman's schedule,

17:05.589 --> 17:07.156
and I'll get back to you.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.418
Of course, Mr. Barrington.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.030
Was that Win Barrington?

17:11.073 --> 17:13.249
Yes. He's been trying to get in
to see Jay.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.425
No, what he's trying to do
is circumvent Jay's assistant

17:15.469 --> 17:17.079
'cause he thinks you're
a loophole. Blake.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.472
Hmm?Tell Nina someone's trying

17:18.515 --> 17:20.213
to loophole her.I'm sorry?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.866
He says he's a representative
of a wellness advocacy group.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.217
Wellness advocacy. It's
Win Barrington trying

17:24.260 --> 17:26.175
to lobby Jay to legalize pot.Ah, yes.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.221
See, part of your job
is to sandbag

17:28.264 --> 17:29.831
dudes like this
who think they can work

17:29.874 --> 17:31.180
around the gatekeepers

17:31.224 --> 17:32.312
and waste everybody's time

17:32.355 --> 17:33.922
with vaporizers and bongs.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.402
Dude's a clown.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.491
Blake'll fill you in.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.493
[sighs]

17:41.538 --> 17:45.107
Okay. Win was Daisy's fiancée.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.283
She broke up with him
to start dating Matt.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.329
Well, actually, they were
already secretly dating.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.808
Oh.Yeah. By the way,

17:50.852 --> 17:51.983
I'm reading you in on
classified information, so...

17:52.027 --> 17:53.898
Oh. Yeah, no problem.Okay. So, um,

17:53.942 --> 17:55.248
on election night
a few years ago,

17:55.291 --> 17:56.553
Matt was making
a play for Daisy,

17:56.597 --> 17:59.121
but she went home
with Win instead,

17:59.165 --> 18:00.296
so what you are
looking at now is...

18:00.340 --> 18:02.124
Two alphas,
neither of whom ended up

18:02.168 --> 18:03.430
with the girl. Got it.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.431
So, go ahead and make

18:04.474 --> 18:05.562
the appointment for Jay?Oh.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.390
God, no. Win's a
ridiculous pot lobbyist.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.305
I just thought you'd be
interested in the gossip.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.351
Oh.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.355
Hmm.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.574
You're actually suggesting
that I sponsor a bill

18:17.618 --> 18:20.099
to cut off all federal funding
to my home state?

18:20.142 --> 18:22.362
ELIZABETH:
I'm suggesting you help

18:22.405 --> 18:25.104
reunite children
with their moms and dads

18:25.147 --> 18:27.149
as quickly as possible.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.151
The way to do that is
through the courts.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.370
Well, unfortunately,

18:30.413 --> 18:31.893
the administration's application

18:31.936 --> 18:34.330
for a preliminary injunction
was denied,

18:34.374 --> 18:38.117
so any legal remedy
could take months.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.119
If we want to end this quickly,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.469
Congress needs to step up.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.906
I-I don't like Barker's methods,
but I don't disagree

18:44.949 --> 18:46.734
with his position
on border security.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.084
I'm not asking you
to take sides on that deal.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.173
Yes, you are. And Arizonans

18:51.217 --> 18:53.567
are deeply concerned about
unchecked immigration.

18:53.610 --> 18:56.047
Carlos, I know your thoughts
on the border.

18:56.091 --> 18:59.355
I'm just asking you
to help these kids.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.270
By committing political suicide.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.925
By doing the right thing.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.579
I know what's right.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.972
And I am staunchly against the
federal government undermining

19:08.016 --> 19:11.846
a state's authority to
regulate its own border.Come on, Senator.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.239
You know there are a million
reasons the federal government

19:13.282 --> 19:15.980
has to be in charge
of the border.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.551
You want to talk state's rights?

19:21.595 --> 19:23.684
How about human rights?

19:28.732 --> 19:33.302
I understand that we disagree
on policy.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.436
But this is about
who we are as a country.

19:36.479 --> 19:39.352
And anyone who doesn't fight

19:39.395 --> 19:41.832
this appalling
human rights violation

19:41.876 --> 19:42.964
with everything they've got,

19:43.007 --> 19:45.532
even if it means
political suicide,

19:45.575 --> 19:47.229
may as well be for it.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.407
It is a moral outrage.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.932
And you may be right. [sighs]

19:54.976 --> 19:56.891
But I will not let

19:56.934 --> 19:59.546
the federal government
bully my home state.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.851
I'm sorry.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.376
Look, I hope you heal fast.

20:03.419 --> 20:04.855
Thanks.And from what I hear,

20:04.899 --> 20:06.770
these detention centers
aren't all that bad.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.123
They say it's like summer camp
for kids.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.431
Thanks for stopping by, Senator.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.874
[door closes]

20:23.918 --> 20:25.876
You all right?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.401
Sorry I snapped.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.664
My ankle.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.840
STEVIE:
Man.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.885
This is hard.
I haven't written a poem

20:34.929 --> 20:36.496
since, like, seventh grade.

20:36.539 --> 20:37.932
Actually,
that was more of a rap.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.673
Ooh, a rap could be fun.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.762
Yeah. Mm... but no.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.547
No.Hey, guys, I think
I got something.

20:44.591 --> 20:48.247
"The way we love our perfect
parents can never be co-opted,

20:48.290 --> 20:50.423
"though Stevie was an accident

20:50.466 --> 20:51.554
and Ali is adopted."

20:51.598 --> 20:52.686
Cut it out.Please, be serious.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.078
No. You know what, I...

20:54.122 --> 20:55.993
It's a little hard to be serious

20:56.037 --> 20:57.952
with everything going on
in Arizona.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.954
Can't you just donate
money to the ACLU

20:59.997 --> 21:04.132
like I did and get on board
with the celebration, dude?[phone chimes]

21:04.175 --> 21:06.003
Okay? This is the only part
that I actually asked you

21:06.047 --> 21:08.354
to help with. No.Mmm.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.920
What?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.618
Laser Dawn is canceling?

21:11.661 --> 21:12.967
What is that?Why?

21:13.010 --> 21:15.099
It's the band that I booked
for the after-party.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.667
They're breaking up
over creative differences?

21:17.711 --> 21:18.886
They're a wedding band.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.409
What creative differences
could they have?

21:20.453 --> 21:22.237
The name, for starters.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.718
Well, why did we
even get a band?

21:24.761 --> 21:25.675
They're so cheesy.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.155
We should just
get a deejay.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.331
Well, no, because
Mom and Dad arecheesy,

21:29.375 --> 21:31.072
and they wanted a band.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.335
And this is their party, and
we're supposed to be helping.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.077
I mean, how am I supposed
to book a decent band

21:36.120 --> 21:38.862
[laughing]:
in the middle
of the holidays,

21:38.906 --> 21:40.299
at the last minute?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.822
You were going for "decent"?

21:41.865 --> 21:43.998
No, Jason.
I was going for "good."

21:44.041 --> 21:46.217
But nowI'm at "decent,"
and tomorrow

21:46.261 --> 21:49.960
I might be at "washboard
and mouth harp," for all I know.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.137
DALTON:
It was always a long shot

21:53.181 --> 21:54.965
with Morejon.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.358
I don't know.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.273
I thought I got
through to him.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.710
Never underestimate a senator's
desire to keep their seat.

22:00.754 --> 22:01.885
[chuckles]

22:01.929 --> 22:04.018
I actually think
I overestimated

22:04.061 --> 22:06.890
our checks and balances
against malfeasance

22:06.934 --> 22:08.501
and bad faith.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.807
Yeah. Our system
counts on our public officials

22:10.851 --> 22:12.461
to be of good faith.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.464
We rely on their basic...
decency and morality.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.248
Without it,

22:17.292 --> 22:18.467
norms break down.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.295
And even the President
of the United States

22:20.339 --> 22:22.558
can end up powerless
to fix things.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.387
Oh, I'm not giving
up on you yet, sir.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.216
Thanks, but the, uh,
good people of Arizona

22:28.259 --> 22:30.958
have been sold a bill of goods
by a demagogue

22:31.001 --> 22:33.526
spouting about a fake,
trumped-up crisis at the border,

22:33.569 --> 22:35.789
and now children
are paying the price.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.312
Hey. Sorry I'm late.Hey.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.401
I had a few things
to finish up.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.882
Well, we seem to be out
of checks and balances,

22:41.925 --> 22:43.100
so no worries.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.407
Yeah. Uh, about that...

22:45.451 --> 22:46.669
[pouring drink]

22:46.713 --> 22:49.933
After getting shot down
by Judge Mayfield,

22:49.977 --> 22:53.154
my spidey-sense told me
something was amiss,

22:53.197 --> 22:55.417
so I stopped by his chambers.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.985
Ooh. Judges love it
when you do that.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.334
Yeah, actually,
I was counting on

22:59.378 --> 23:01.162
getting his dander up,
and he didn't disappoint.

23:01.205 --> 23:04.557
Revealed his true
partisan hack colors.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.254
Fishing for grounds
to appeal?

23:06.297 --> 23:08.038
Yeah, I already
hooked one.

23:08.082 --> 23:11.433
I spent the afternoon
poking around.

23:11.477 --> 23:15.350
Found the judge has
real estate holdings in Arizona

23:15.394 --> 23:19.136
that are directly affected
by state policies

23:19.180 --> 23:22.357
dictated by our friend
Governor Barker.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.535
Well, that's a hell
of a coincidence.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.450
Not when you consider
they were fraternity brothers

23:28.494 --> 23:30.104
at Arizona State.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.584
[exhales]

23:31.627 --> 23:33.412
You think that's a clear enough
conflict of interest?

23:33.455 --> 23:34.630
Well...

23:34.674 --> 23:37.372
the AG's reviewing it
with his team.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.679
I'd love to blow
that little weasel

23:39.722 --> 23:40.680
right off the bench.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.769
I'm just concerned

23:42.812 --> 23:43.857
about the optics

23:43.900 --> 23:45.206
of the White House
going after a judge

23:45.249 --> 23:48.775
because we don't like
his ruling.

23:48.818 --> 23:51.473
I'm not sure
this particular bullet

23:51.517 --> 23:54.781
should stay in the chamber,
so to speak.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.000
Aren't we beyond worrying
about optics?

23:57.044 --> 23:59.655
I mean, our standing
in the world is at stake.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.920
I say fire that bullet.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.537
[music plays softly]

24:18.544 --> 24:19.849
Senator.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.372
How's the leg?

24:25.638 --> 24:26.813
[chuckles]

24:34.777 --> 24:36.953
Excuse me, could I get
a cranberry soda?

24:36.997 --> 24:38.564
All right.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.441
Mm-hmm.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.851
I assume you're asking this
because I'm Cuban?

25:04.894 --> 25:06.983
Brown.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.985
To them, you're brown.

25:09.029 --> 25:11.248
First generation, but...

25:13.642 --> 25:17.254
I know your family story.
It's on your website.

25:17.298 --> 25:20.997
They were boat people crammed
into an overloaded trawler,

25:21.041 --> 25:22.303
escaping Castro.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.087
And they were lucky
enough to get to shore,

25:24.131 --> 25:25.828
because of the
wet foot, dry foot policy.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.264
But tell me, how were your
parents any different

25:27.308 --> 25:28.614
from the parents in Arizona

25:28.657 --> 25:30.050
who are separated from
their kids tonight?

25:31.573 --> 25:35.272
Well, my mother and my father
didn't break the law.

25:35.316 --> 25:36.883
Look, my dad's
from Uruguay,

25:36.926 --> 25:38.319
but...

25:38.362 --> 25:40.103
I'm a stealth Latino.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.237
I know it.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.805
Every once in a while,
when I'm out...

25:45.848 --> 25:48.851
somewhere talking to my
dad on the phone or...

25:48.895 --> 25:50.461
speaking Spanish
for whatever reason,

25:50.505 --> 25:53.160
I-I notice some people
look at me differently.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.553
Instant lower status.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.032
Every once in a while,

25:56.076 --> 25:58.948
they tell me to "speak
English, amigo."

25:58.992 --> 26:01.472
Or "American."
That-that's my favorite.

26:01.516 --> 26:05.172
Well, sometimes people
hand me their keys

26:05.215 --> 26:06.826
at the valet.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.524
Yale, Harvard Law,
Rhodes Scholar,

26:09.568 --> 26:11.657
U.S. senator-- all they
see is "brown guy."

26:11.700 --> 26:13.180
That's right.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.008
Somepeople.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.622
But, Jay...

26:20.666 --> 26:22.711
I don't need you to lecture me
on unconscious bias.

26:22.755 --> 26:25.627
Unconscious? Is that
what you think it is?

26:25.671 --> 26:27.324
How can you ignore

26:27.368 --> 26:29.718
the blatant racism
of this policy?

26:29.762 --> 26:33.069
Don't we already have a
steep enough hill to climb

26:33.113 --> 26:35.115
without allowing Arizona

26:35.158 --> 26:37.726
to normalize treating
people like us as-as...

26:37.770 --> 26:39.772
less than human?

26:39.815 --> 26:41.861
If not for those
kids in detention,

26:41.904 --> 26:43.210
how about for ourkids?

26:43.253 --> 26:45.821
How is this not more
personal for you?

26:45.865 --> 26:46.953
The secretary
put you up to this?

26:46.996 --> 26:48.607
Por favor, she doesn't
know anything.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.870
I saw you wavering
in her office.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.786
I know you want to be on
the right side of this.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.658
Look, there are
no sides, Jay.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.488
The only way to change
what people see

27:00.531 --> 27:03.534
is to continue to succeed.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.755
Not through identity politics,

27:06.799 --> 27:08.670
but hard work.

27:08.714 --> 27:12.195
I never sought to be
the Moses for Latinos.

27:12.239 --> 27:15.851
My kids see how hard Iwork
and what I've achieved.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.506
Just like your
daughter sees you.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.770
And for me, that...

27:21.814 --> 27:23.816
[whispers]:
that is enough.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.993
And...

27:27.036 --> 27:30.866
I'm sorry that
it's not the same for you.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.482
POLLARD:
This case has been remanded

27:38.526 --> 27:40.876
by the appellate court
for reconsideration

27:40.920 --> 27:44.358
on the grounds that
Judge Mayfield was conflicted.

27:44.401 --> 27:45.576
The issue before us

27:45.620 --> 27:47.970
is whether to grant
a preliminary injunction

27:48.014 --> 27:51.495
halting Arizona's detention
of unauthorized immigrants.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.019
Counsel?Judge Pollard,

27:53.062 --> 27:55.369
if I can direct the court
to U.S. v. Jenlow.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.458
Not apposite, Your Honor.I disagree.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.503
And I've reviewed

27:59.547 --> 28:01.810
the petitioner's affidavits
in detail.

28:01.854 --> 28:04.508
The government has clearly made
a prima facie showing

28:04.552 --> 28:06.075
of irreparable harm

28:06.119 --> 28:07.207
to these children.Your Honor...

28:07.250 --> 28:08.599
I also believe that

28:08.643 --> 28:11.515
petitioner's likelihood
of success on the merits

28:11.559 --> 28:13.648
is great.Judge, the APA's amicus brief...

28:13.692 --> 28:15.171
I've read it,

28:15.215 --> 28:18.914
Ms. Cutler, and unless you
have anything new, I'm inclined

28:18.958 --> 28:20.742
to rule against
the State of Arizona

28:20.786 --> 28:22.701
and grant a preliminary...

28:25.834 --> 28:29.795
In a case brought on behalf
of the separated families

28:29.838 --> 28:33.450
by the ACLU, the Ninth Circuit
has just affirmed

28:33.494 --> 28:35.757
the District Court
of Arizona's opinion

28:35.801 --> 28:38.847
that the affected families
of Arizona's separation order

28:38.891 --> 28:40.936
do not suffer

28:40.980 --> 28:42.111
irreparable harm.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.896
Judge, the ACLU is
a private litigant,

28:43.939 --> 28:46.550
so the case
is not precisely on point.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.248
That is true.And this court
is not bound

28:48.291 --> 28:50.729
by another federal
appellate court's judgment.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.382
Also true.

28:52.426 --> 28:56.125
But the opinion adjudicated
nearly identical facts.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.127
I consider that
persuasive authority

28:58.171 --> 28:59.389
and a judgment

28:59.433 --> 29:02.784
I am not inclined to contravene.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.917
Wha...
Uh, so...

29:04.960 --> 29:07.876
th-that's it?

29:07.920 --> 29:09.965
An inadvertent
legal wire-crossing

29:10.009 --> 29:12.881
means all those kids

29:12.925 --> 29:14.927
have to remain separated
from their parents?

29:14.970 --> 29:16.711
I'm afraid so.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.192
You'll have to let your suit
wend its way through the system,

29:19.235 --> 29:22.021
Mr. Jackson.

29:22.064 --> 29:22.891
MIKE:
Look at this.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.110
A sign from the gods.Hey.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.111
I am trolling for favors,

29:25.154 --> 29:26.460
and here you are.
I also need

29:26.503 --> 29:28.462
to hit up Russell
Jackson as well.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.551
This might not be
the best time.
Yeah, I heard.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.118
Bit of an ouch-y in court.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.642
How else would
you describe it?Oh, I don't know, Mike,

29:34.685 --> 29:36.687
maybe sensitively.Mm.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.428
What favors
are you here for?

29:38.472 --> 29:40.822
I need recommendation letters
for my kid's super-elitist,

29:40.866 --> 29:43.085
beyond-his-intellectual-
capacity private school.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.000
Mike, do you really want

29:45.044 --> 29:48.264
to send your son to a school
that he is not suited for?

29:48.308 --> 29:49.788
100%. So can I count on you?

29:49.831 --> 29:52.486
Well, it's a hell of a day
to be asking for a favor

29:52.529 --> 29:53.835
for your privileged kid.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.665
[sighs] All right,
send me his application

29:57.708 --> 29:59.232
and his ess...

29:59.275 --> 30:00.668
No promises.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.540
Fine. Look, I also got
the invite to your vow thing.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.934
Nice optics. I can't believe
I didn't think of it myself.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.589
I reached out
to thevideographer...No publicity.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.330
No publicity.
Just a videographer.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.506
Very discreet drones.
You won't even hear them.

30:12.549 --> 30:15.030
Mike, this is a personal
and private event.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.640
No politics.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.077
No angles.
Hey, look,

30:18.120 --> 30:19.600
I have been
dissecting the polls,

30:19.643 --> 30:21.080
and while you have
broad support--

30:21.123 --> 30:22.690
no pun intended--
you lack voter intensity.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.692
People like you,
but they don't love you.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.520
Do you know what
could change that?

30:26.563 --> 30:28.522
The sight of you
in a wedding dress.

30:28.565 --> 30:31.394
America would
go macadamia.
As in nuts.

30:31.438 --> 30:34.528
No, no, I put it together.
The answer's still no.[stammering]

30:34.571 --> 30:35.921
Okay, let's just get
the footage,

30:35.964 --> 30:37.966
and then we'll
sort it out in post.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.577
President Zaragoza,
I agree this is a travesty.

30:40.621 --> 30:43.232
Arizona won't even let
Mexican diplomats in

30:43.276 --> 30:46.018
to visit our citizens.That's unacceptable,
and we will do everything

30:46.061 --> 30:48.716
in our power to help your people
gain access as soon as possible.

30:48.759 --> 30:52.154
I'm afraid
until this outrage is ended

30:52.198 --> 30:53.939
it is not just
our border security deal

30:53.982 --> 30:55.505
that is off the table.

30:55.549 --> 30:58.160
Our entire relationship
is at stake.

30:58.204 --> 30:59.292
Mario...

30:59.335 --> 31:01.250
I am sorry.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.123
He's right.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.039
I'd have reacted
the same way.

31:07.082 --> 31:10.694
So, our border security deal
is dead.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.610
And our vital trade agreements
and a million others

31:13.654 --> 31:16.309
with our neighbors to
the south are threatened.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.050
And every hour that passes

31:18.093 --> 31:19.921
with kids separated
from their parents

31:19.965 --> 31:22.097
lowers our standing
in the world.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.491
Courts can't help us,
Congress won't,

31:24.534 --> 31:27.886
and we are powerless
to do a damn thing about it.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.279
Did I miss anything?

31:30.323 --> 31:31.933
HENRY:
Maybe one.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.239
Lao-tzu said:

31:33.282 --> 31:36.938
"An ant on the move
does more than a dozing ox."

31:38.853 --> 31:40.811
What the hell does that mean?If you can't do
everything,

31:40.855 --> 31:41.900
at least do something.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.379
Keep moving
in the right direction.

31:43.423 --> 31:46.252
What do you have in mind, Henry?Go down there,

31:46.295 --> 31:47.470
Mr. President.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.950
Walk those Mexican officials

31:48.994 --> 31:50.909
into the detention
center yourself.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.693
RUSSELL:
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:52.736 --> 31:55.043
That... could open us up
to accusations

31:55.087 --> 31:57.045
of infringing on states' rights.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.307
That is... that is

31:58.351 --> 32:01.354
practically asking
for a constitutional crisis.

32:01.397 --> 32:04.226
Look, I-I am as disgusted
as any of you,

32:04.270 --> 32:06.402
but I will throw my body

32:06.446 --> 32:08.970
in front of that.Well, then I'll do it.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.406
Did you hear what I just said?

32:10.450 --> 32:12.408
Yes, and I'm not the president.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.890
You might be ensuring
that you never will be.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.501
It's-it's domestic interference.

32:18.545 --> 32:22.157
I'd be the Secretary of State
working with our Mexican allies

32:22.201 --> 32:24.029
to visit their own citizens.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.727
HENRY:
Advocating for foreign
dignitaries on our soil--

32:26.770 --> 32:28.250
it's not only
a moral imperative,

32:28.294 --> 32:30.426
it's a diplomatic
one, as well.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.995
Sounds very
Secretary-of-Statey to me.

32:34.039 --> 32:37.172
Mr. President, Governor
Barker's intentionally

32:37.216 --> 32:40.349
provocative policy
deserves to be met

32:40.393 --> 32:43.918
with an equally
provocative response.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.971
MAN:
Madam Secretary?Reunite the families!

32:53.014 --> 32:57.540
KAT: Well, it's not
exactly the Hilton.

32:57.584 --> 32:58.977
Well, it would be different

32:59.020 --> 33:00.543
if their parents
were with them.

33:00.587 --> 33:01.849
Mm.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.068
Oh, God, this isn't
gonna be easy.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.504
Nope, it's not, ma'am,
but you know what?

33:04.547 --> 33:06.506
There's no other place
I would rather be.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.508
PROTESTORS [chanting]:
Reunite the families!

33:08.551 --> 33:10.423
You know, the second
we're done here,

33:10.466 --> 33:12.294
feel free to go
see your dad.

33:12.338 --> 33:13.643
How far away
is he again?

33:13.687 --> 33:15.210
Oh, Dad's a couple hours
in Aguila.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.299
Thank you, but I'll probably
take a rain check.

33:17.343 --> 33:18.909
Madam Secretary.

33:18.953 --> 33:21.260
Ambassador Lopez,
you know Kat Sandoval.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.652
[speaking Spanish]

33:22.696 --> 33:25.220
I am here at the direction
of President Zaragoza

33:25.264 --> 33:27.222
to look after the
interests of my citizens.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.398
Of course.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.010
Well, let's do this.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.360
All right.

33:34.403 --> 33:37.798
Good afternoon...
Officer Keegan.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.669
I'm Elizabeth McCord.

33:39.713 --> 33:43.108
This is Mexican Ambassador
Rafael Lopez.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.283
Well, how are you today?

33:44.326 --> 33:45.371
I'm okay, ma'am,

33:45.414 --> 33:47.112
but I'm afraid...That's great.

33:47.155 --> 33:50.289
I'm here to escort the
ambassador inside the facility

33:50.332 --> 33:52.682
so that he can check
on his citizens.

33:52.726 --> 33:55.424
I'm afraid I'm not authorized
to allow that, ma'am.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.297
I wasn't clear
about that, either, and...

33:58.340 --> 34:00.603
This is Kat Sandoval,
my policy advisor.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.475
Kat, can you help us out here?

34:02.518 --> 34:04.216
Hey there, Officer Keegan.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.522
It's totally understandable that
you wouldn't be up to speed,

34:06.566 --> 34:08.307
given the different state
and federal laws.

34:08.350 --> 34:11.484
It can be a little bit,
you know-- "Aah!"-- confusing.

34:11.527 --> 34:14.835
However, under title 22
USC section 26-51,

34:14.878 --> 34:17.403
"Foreign Nationals on U.S.
Soil," you must yield

34:17.446 --> 34:19.274
and allow entry
immediately.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.971
Huh.

34:21.015 --> 34:23.061
Yeah, and it literally
says, "immediately."

34:23.104 --> 34:24.497
[static]

34:24.540 --> 34:26.107
Hey, Miller?

34:26.151 --> 34:27.456
I don't think we want to get

34:27.500 --> 34:29.284
any of our bosses involved.Yeah.

34:29.328 --> 34:32.374
Right,
Officer Keegan?

34:32.418 --> 34:34.420
Um...

34:34.463 --> 34:36.422
You'll just need
to surrender your phones.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.380
Great. Thank you.Of course.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.122
[knocking]

34:41.166 --> 34:43.298
Hey.
Hey.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.387
Here's a blast from your past.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.041
What are you doing here?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.956
Okay, maybe not my
strongest entrance,

34:48.999 --> 34:51.393
but I do come
bearing gifts.

34:51.437 --> 34:54.440
I realize I'm a little
late with the baby present.

34:54.483 --> 34:56.964
What is he,
five months now?
She.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.400
And a year.
Oh.

34:58.444 --> 35:02.448
Wow. Uh, well, then I guess
it's a birthday present.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.841
And here's a little something

35:04.885 --> 35:06.539
I brought for Jay.Mm-hmm.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.758
I feel so bad about
what happened.

35:08.802 --> 35:11.239
I'm not sure he believed
I didn't do it on purpose,

35:11.283 --> 35:13.241
but I-I swear, I am
not a good enough

35:13.285 --> 35:14.503
defensive player
to make that happen.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.201
Yeah, I'm not entirely
in the loop on this,

35:16.244 --> 35:17.550
and I like it that way.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.465
Fair enough.

35:19.508 --> 35:22.337
It's just that earlier I was
asking about the possibility

35:22.381 --> 35:24.122
of a sit-down
with the secretary, and ...

35:24.165 --> 35:26.036
Look, it's kind of
a busy day around here,

35:26.080 --> 35:28.561
and y-you're just gonna have
to find someone else to lobby.

35:28.604 --> 35:33.000
Well, can you just make
sure he gets this then?

35:33.043 --> 35:34.610
It, uh, has some
goodies in there

35:34.654 --> 35:35.916
that'll help
with the pain.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.310
Did you seriously bring
a controlled substance

35:38.353 --> 35:39.528
into the State Department?

35:39.572 --> 35:40.703
Not for the first time,
if you'll recall.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.576
You know,
when-when there was a lockdown,

35:43.619 --> 35:45.447
and I got Matt high,
and I found out

35:45.491 --> 35:47.319
that you were cheating
on me with him, and...

35:47.362 --> 35:49.451
Okay, I will.
I will get this to Jay.

35:49.495 --> 35:51.453
And I will tell him
whatever it is I remember

35:51.497 --> 35:52.367
of what you just said.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.108
You're a peach.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.458
But... you-you know, like,
a really smart one.

35:56.502 --> 35:57.894
Mm.I'm sorry.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.200
Maybe I shouldn't have gone
with a stone fruit.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.810
It... Uh...

36:00.854 --> 36:03.161
All-all right, yeah.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.035
[door closes loudly,
lights buzzing]

36:13.345 --> 36:15.912
In here.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.743
Oh, my God.

36:20.787 --> 36:24.138
Madre, Madre, quiero mi madre.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.226
[indistinct chatter]

36:25.270 --> 36:27.750
How is this possible?

36:27.794 --> 36:30.100
The great United States
of America.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.805
[children crying,
indistinct chatter]

36:43.462 --> 36:45.464
[crying and chatter continue]

36:52.471 --> 36:56.649
Hey, excuse me?

36:56.692 --> 36:59.652
Are you gonna change
that boy's diaper?

36:59.695 --> 37:02.089
I mean, I'm assuming
he has one.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.439
Child aides make rounds
every three hours.

37:04.483 --> 37:06.833
Three hours.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.533
So you're just gonna
leave him like that?

37:11.577 --> 37:14.188
'Cause, I mean, where are his
clothes? I'll change him myself.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.189
Ma'am, that's
not procedure.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.712
I don't care about procedure.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.627
Look at him.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.159
Hola.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.083
Daniel.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.955
Daniel.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.708
Daniel, no.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.590
[buzzer sounds]

38:08.634 --> 38:09.983
RICHARD: Secretary
Elizabeth McCord,

38:10.026 --> 38:14.117
you are trespassing
on Arizona state property.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.250
Am I really?

38:16.294 --> 38:18.644
You tricked your way in here,

38:18.687 --> 38:21.168
grandstanding
for the press

38:21.211 --> 38:24.519
on your self-promotion tour,
but you are a long way

38:24.563 --> 38:26.869
from the federal swamp
you call home.

38:29.742 --> 38:33.180
Well, Governor,
if Washington, D.C. is a swamp,

38:33.223 --> 38:36.792
what's this?

38:36.836 --> 38:39.012
It's none of your business
is what it is.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.709
And there's a sheriff out front

38:40.753 --> 38:42.537
with a warrant
for your arrest.

38:42.581 --> 38:46.585
Is he going to arrest
Ambassador Lopez, as well?

38:46.628 --> 38:48.587
Mr. Ambassador,
I'm sorry you got dragged

38:48.630 --> 38:50.371
into Madam Secretary's

38:50.415 --> 38:51.503
little publicity stunt.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.679
I didn't get dragged
into anything.

38:53.722 --> 38:56.377
My government demands these
innocent children get reunited

38:56.421 --> 38:58.684
with their parents immediately.

38:58.727 --> 39:02.035
Your government has
no authority here, sir.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.429
Neither does yours, ma'am.

39:04.472 --> 39:08.868
I think the ambassador's demand
is on humanitarian grounds.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.174
I don't care
if it's on grounds of coffee.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.220
This is my state and my rules.

39:13.263 --> 39:17.746
Lucky for you, I'm feeling
charitable today.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.532
Y'all can exit peaceably

39:20.575 --> 39:22.621
through the back
without talking to any press,

39:22.664 --> 39:25.058
and I'll let you leave
this state without incident.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.799
[laughs]
Without incident?

39:26.842 --> 39:28.975
Okay.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.107
Look around, Governor.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.109
We passed that.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.111
I suggest you get moving

39:35.155 --> 39:38.419
before I invite the good sheriff
in here to come get you.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.378
[child crying]

39:42.467 --> 39:46.993
Did you think you can
intimidate me or shut me up?

39:51.998 --> 39:53.434
Don't test Arizona justice,
ma'am.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.653
[buzzer sounding]

39:54.696 --> 39:56.263
FATHER DINARDO:
Saint Francis said,

39:56.306 --> 39:58.352
"All the darkness in the world
cannot extinguish the light

39:58.396 --> 39:59.875
of a single candle."MAN: That's right!

39:59.919 --> 40:02.443
If it took a visit
from the Secretary of State

40:02.487 --> 40:05.359
to shine a light on the darkness
inside this building,

40:05.403 --> 40:07.361
then praise the Lord
for sending her.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.450
And God bless
and protect those children,

40:09.494 --> 40:11.974
our little brothers and sisters
in the Lord's kingdom.

40:12.018 --> 40:13.976
Why did you come to Arizona,
Madam Secretary?

40:14.020 --> 40:16.065
What did you see in there?Are the children
being mistreated?

40:16.109 --> 40:17.632
MAN: What kind of care
do they have in there?

40:17.676 --> 40:19.199
MAN 2:
What do you hope to prove?

40:19.242 --> 40:21.201
I came here to see for myself

40:21.244 --> 40:24.465
and to help Ambassador Lopez see

40:24.509 --> 40:26.380
what's going on
behind these walls.

40:26.424 --> 40:30.340
What I saw is an affront
to decency

40:30.384 --> 40:35.737
and an assault
on our country's core values.

40:35.781 --> 40:39.393
Children separated
from their parents,

40:39.437 --> 40:44.050
in cages, crying, terrified,

40:44.093 --> 40:46.835
lacking basic care.

40:46.879 --> 40:49.751
[phone ringing]

40:49.795 --> 40:51.710
And the governor believes
it's a deterrent.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.320
It'll keep others...Hi.

40:53.363 --> 40:54.321
Are you seeing this?

40:54.364 --> 40:55.365
HENRY:
Yup.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.106
That's your mom.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.544
[siren blaring]But it is child abuse,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.284
plain and simple.Ma'am?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.156
WOMAN:
Yes!
No deterrent

41:03.199 --> 41:07.421
is worth trading
our humanity.
That's enough.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.815
No policy, no
matter its goal,

41:09.858 --> 41:12.252
is worth lowering
our moral standing

41:12.295 --> 41:14.210
in the world.
RICHARD:
All right.

41:14.254 --> 41:16.648
Nothing can justify
harming children.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.388
Ma'am, you are
on state property.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.826
And the governor
wants me to shut up.

41:20.869 --> 41:22.480
Yes.

41:22.523 --> 41:25.308
But I won't, because
what he's doing

41:25.352 --> 41:27.702
is immoral and
un-American,

41:27.746 --> 41:31.140
and every American
needs to know about it.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.838
SHERIFF:
Elizabeth McCord,

41:32.881 --> 41:34.927
you are under arrest

41:34.970 --> 41:36.972
for criminal trespass
in the first degree

41:37.016 --> 41:38.583
in violation of section 13...No.

41:38.626 --> 41:41.673
No! No! ...-1504.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.849
[overlapping shouting]

41:43.892 --> 41:45.720
Well...

41:45.764 --> 41:48.506
if desperate asylum-seekers

41:48.549 --> 41:51.030
aren't free from being

41:51.073 --> 41:53.336
detained unfairly

41:53.380 --> 41:55.338
in this state,

41:55.382 --> 41:57.558
why should I?

41:57.602 --> 41:59.473
Take her in, Trooper.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.561
Please.

42:00.605 --> 42:03.346
It's okay, Jared.
It's okay.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.958
[indistinct,
overlapping shouting]

42:06.001 --> 42:07.960
Officer Stevens.

42:08.003 --> 42:10.484
STEVENS:
Uh, if you could please
turn around and put your hands

42:10.528 --> 42:11.529
behind your back?

42:11.572 --> 42:13.008
Okay.

42:13.052 --> 42:16.403
I'm guessing this isn't how
you thought your day would go.

42:16.446 --> 42:17.535
STEVENS:
No, ma'am.

42:17.578 --> 42:18.448
SHERIFF:
Take the protestors, too.

42:18.492 --> 42:20.581
You're under arrest.

42:20.625 --> 42:23.932
[indistinct,
overlapping shouting]

42:23.976 --> 42:25.673
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

42:25.717 --> 42:27.370
HENRY:
Not in the United States.

42:27.414 --> 42:29.285
No. Not here.

42:29.329 --> 42:31.940
Never.

42:33.594 --> 42:35.596
PROTESTORS [chanting]:
Reunite families!

42:35.640 --> 42:37.555
