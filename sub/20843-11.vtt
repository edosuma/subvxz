<i>Previously...</i>

00:02.171 --> 00:04.408
‐ Please welcome Shaun!
‐ Shaun!

00:04.408 --> 00:05.945
( cheering )

00:05.945 --> 00:08.016
<i>A champion's mystery box</i>

00:08.016 --> 00:11.256
<i>took the competition</i>
<i>to another level.</i>

00:11.256 --> 00:13.093
It tastes a lot
like my finale dish.

00:13.093 --> 00:16.032
<i>But a mystery ingredient...</i>

00:16.032 --> 00:17.434
Gordon: Coconuts.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.438
<i>...left Reba behind...</i>

00:19.438 --> 00:23.113
It looks like something
from a buffet back in 1984.

00:23.113 --> 00:25.217
‐ <i>leading to her...</i>
‐ I'm gonna miss you, Reba.

00:25.217 --> 00:27.221
<i>...emotional farewell.</i>

00:30.360 --> 00:32.231
Tonight is a big one.

00:32.231 --> 00:35.470
<i>The 50th anniversary</i>
<i>of Caesars Palace.</i>

00:35.470 --> 00:38.143
Announcer:
<i>It's a high stakes</i>
<i>team challenge.</i>

00:38.143 --> 00:40.548
Pick your people
or your protein.

00:40.548 --> 00:42.251
<i>But when the home cooks</i>
<i>roll the dice...</i>

00:42.251 --> 00:44.155
‐ Yachecia: Ooh!
‐ Getting so ( bleep) nervous.

00:44.155 --> 00:47.061
<i>...whose gamble will pay off</i>
<i>and who will lose it all...</i>

00:47.061 --> 00:48.831
‐ Ah!
‐ <i>...in Sin City?</i>

00:48.831 --> 00:50.602
‐ How far off?
‐ It's not ready.

00:50.602 --> 00:54.275
‐ Come on!
‐ This is Vegas,
and it's go big...

00:54.275 --> 00:56.412
The most expensive meat
in the country.

00:56.412 --> 00:59.018
‐ ...or go home.
‐ Who sliced it?

01:03.794 --> 01:07.468
Look at this right here.
We're in the middle of Vegas
like this right now.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.908
‐ How awesome is this?
‐ Whoo‐hoo!

01:10.908 --> 01:12.545
Daniel:
<i>This is actually</i>
<i>my first time in Vegas.</i>

01:12.545 --> 01:14.650
You know, it's one thing
to see it on TV

01:14.650 --> 01:18.490
or see it in movies,
but to actually be on the Strip
is definitely exciting.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.027
This is awesome.

01:20.027 --> 01:23.400
Top 12 best home cooks
in America.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.437
Top 12 best dressed
in America.

01:25.437 --> 01:28.176
<i>Whatever were doing tonight,</i>
<i>it's going to be big.</i>

01:28.176 --> 01:30.213
‐ We made it, yes!
‐ Crazy.

01:34.523 --> 01:37.361
Come on down,
you glamorous 12.

01:37.361 --> 01:39.533
Oh, my gosh!

01:39.533 --> 01:43.541
Walking into Caesars Palace
is absolutely phenomenal,
iconic.

01:43.541 --> 01:47.481
<i>To see the pool</i>
<i>set up for dining,</i>
<i>oh, my gosh.</i>

01:47.481 --> 01:51.623
I've never been to anything
this luxurious before.

01:51.623 --> 01:54.395
Welcome to the world‐famous
Caesars Palace.

01:54.395 --> 01:56.299
( all cheering )

01:56.299 --> 02:01.677
This legendary hotel
is the global Mecca
of utter decadence,

02:01.677 --> 02:04.716
offering some
of the best restaurants
anywhere in the world,

02:04.716 --> 02:07.087
‐ including mine.
‐ Whoo! Yes!

02:07.087 --> 02:09.058
And tonight
is a big one.

02:09.058 --> 02:11.697
<i>The 50th anniversary</i>
<i>of Caesars Palace.</i>

02:11.697 --> 02:13.366
( all cheering )

02:13.366 --> 02:16.640
Christina:
And for this Caesars Palace
50th Anniversary party,

02:16.640 --> 02:20.480
you will be feeding
50 of Caesars' VIPs,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.486
entertainment and hospitality
industry heavyweights.

02:23.486 --> 02:25.390
( cheers, applause )

02:25.390 --> 02:28.631
Dino, Daniel, since you
had the best two dishes

02:28.631 --> 02:30.568
in the last elimination
challenge,

02:30.568 --> 02:32.404
‐ you will be team captains.
‐ All right.

02:32.404 --> 02:35.511
Now, Dino,
since you had the best dish
in that previous challenge,

02:35.511 --> 02:40.020
tonight, you can either
pick your whole team first

02:40.020 --> 02:45.163
or you can decide
which protein each team will
have to cook with tonight.

02:45.163 --> 02:46.499
Understood, guys?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.469
all: Yes, Chef.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.777
First up,
a sophisticated delicacy,

02:51.777 --> 02:56.352
a beautiful sea bass.

02:56.352 --> 02:58.824
A incredible, silky,
white, sweet fish

02:58.824 --> 03:01.062
that is highly prized
in the culinary world.

03:01.062 --> 03:05.905
Your second option is another
highly‐prized rare protein,

03:05.905 --> 03:11.115
‐ the stunning rib cap.
‐ Wow.

03:11.115 --> 03:12.952
Gordon:
It has the tenderness
of a filet mignon

03:12.952 --> 03:15.123
but the marbling
of a ribeye.

03:15.123 --> 03:18.631
It is truly an exceptional
cut of meat.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.801
All right, Dino,
what are you gonna choose?

03:20.801 --> 03:24.041
Your people
or your protein?

03:24.041 --> 03:25.611
At this point,
I'm 0 and 3,

03:25.611 --> 03:28.449
<i>so I can't lose</i>
<i>another team challenge.</i>

03:28.449 --> 03:31.322
In Vegas, sometimes
you gotta take a gamble,

03:31.322 --> 03:33.560
<i>and right now,</i>
<i>this is one of those gambles</i>

03:33.560 --> 03:36.198
that could make or break
my night.

03:39.471 --> 03:40.908
‐ I choose people.
‐ Gordon: Interesting.

03:40.908 --> 03:43.714
So that means, Daniel,
you, young man,

03:43.714 --> 03:46.653
get to pick the protein.

03:46.653 --> 03:48.389
Please come up
and join us here.

03:48.389 --> 03:51.329
Daniel:
<i>I think that Dino</i>
<i>made a major mistake.</i>

03:51.329 --> 03:53.032
All 12 of us
are great cooks,

03:53.032 --> 03:55.003
and a good captain
with the right protein

03:55.003 --> 03:58.343
should be able to lead
any team to victory.

03:58.343 --> 04:01.616
Daniel, I'd like you
to step behind the protein

04:01.616 --> 04:04.622
that you would like to take
to victory tonight.

04:10.534 --> 04:13.473
‐ Ow!
‐ ( laughter )

04:13.473 --> 04:15.845
‐ So you chose the sea bass.
‐ Absolutely.

04:15.845 --> 04:17.582
Dino:
<i>I feel like I hit the jackpot.</i>

04:17.582 --> 04:20.654
Not only do I get to pick
the team that I want,

04:20.654 --> 04:23.660
but I have the protein
that I actually really did want.

04:23.660 --> 04:28.002
Dino, now you're gonna pick
your all‐star team.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.238
This person's an artist,

04:29.238 --> 04:33.279
sort of the Michelangelo
of the whole group, Jason.

04:33.279 --> 04:36.285
Gordon:
Jason. Wow, Jason.

04:36.285 --> 04:37.955
Dino:
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>I'm looking for the A Team.</i>

04:37.955 --> 04:40.360
I need someone who works hard,
someone who's not afraid
to get burned.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.364
‐ Eboni.
‐ Gordon: Eboni.

04:42.364 --> 04:44.068
I'm looking for somebody
who can move around.

04:44.068 --> 04:45.905
Adam.

04:45.905 --> 04:47.374
Take over jobs
when they need to.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.779
Jenny.
<i>I want it all.</i>

04:49.779 --> 04:51.650
I want everybody
that I'm gonna need.

04:51.650 --> 04:54.054
‐ Last pick, young man.
‐ I got to see this person
in action,

04:54.054 --> 04:57.060
and they know
what they're doing for sure.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.007
‐ Cate, baby.
‐ Gordon: Cate. Wow.

05:04.007 --> 05:06.112
Dino:
<i>I'm looking at Daniel's team</i>
<i>right now,</i>

05:06.112 --> 05:09.251
and all I can say to you is,
"Good luck, pal."

05:09.251 --> 05:12.023
Wow. Strong picks.
Good job.

05:12.023 --> 05:15.731
So, the Blue Team
captained by Daniel

05:15.731 --> 05:19.071
consists of Caitlin,
Yachecia,

05:19.071 --> 05:21.877
Jeff, Gabriel,
and Newton.

05:21.877 --> 05:23.479
Each of our 50 guests
will dine

05:23.479 --> 05:26.385
on both the Red
and the Blue Team's plates.

05:26.385 --> 05:29.626
And after that,
they will each cast a vote
for their favorite dish.

05:29.626 --> 05:32.397
The team with the most votes
will be the winning team.

05:32.397 --> 05:36.907
And the losing team will face
the dreaded pressure test.

05:36.907 --> 05:39.746
‐ Are you all ready?
‐ all: Yes, Chef.

05:39.746 --> 05:43.520
Your time starts... now.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.323
‐ Whoo.
‐ Yeah.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.530
Whoo, whoo! Let's go.

05:48.530 --> 05:52.270
All right, so,
we are working with the bass.

05:52.270 --> 05:54.609
It's a nice, meaty fish.
We can get a real nice sear
on it.

05:54.609 --> 05:57.548
‐ Yeah.
‐ Then we're gonna poach it
in, I'm thinking,

05:57.548 --> 06:00.220
butter, wine,
a little bit of ginger,
lemongrass.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.558
We also have
some squash blossoms.

06:02.558 --> 06:05.263
Yachecia, I'm gonna put you
on the barley.

06:05.263 --> 06:07.067
Yes. I was thinking
the same flavors.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.238
The lemongrass,
the leeks, the thyme.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.244
I'm excited about this barley.
I cook with it all the time,

06:12.244 --> 06:14.448
so I think the plate
is gonna be phenomenal.

06:14.448 --> 06:15.684
Is there anyone
that wants to add anything?

06:15.684 --> 06:16.753
‐ No, we're good.
‐ No.

06:16.753 --> 06:19.926
All right, sounds good.
Let's go, let's go.

06:19.926 --> 06:22.130
Are we gonna fan out the steak,
or we gonna leave it bulky
like that?

06:22.130 --> 06:25.270
‐ 'Cause it's pretty damn big.
‐ I feel like we should
leave it whole.

06:25.270 --> 06:28.376
I feel like slicing it
would just create a bloody mess
on the plate.

06:28.376 --> 06:32.284
But you realize what that
chunky thing is gonna look like
on a plate, don't you?

06:32.284 --> 06:34.288
And the potatoes,
I want to do that two ways.

06:34.288 --> 06:36.458
We're not trying to impress
these people two ways.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.398
‐ We need to keep elegant.
‐ Yeah.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.135
‐ I think potato puree.
‐ That's good.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.306
Let's do the potato puree
and roast that cauliflower.

06:43.306 --> 06:46.145
Can we incorporate
goat cheese into that?

06:46.145 --> 06:48.349
‐ I wouldn't do cheese
with the potatoes.
‐ The crème fraîche.

06:48.349 --> 06:49.652
‐ Crème fraîche is
a great thing with puree.
‐ Crème fraîche.

06:49.652 --> 06:50.854
Yeah, better than that.

06:50.854 --> 06:52.758
Dino: <i>All my ideas</i>
<i>are getting shut down.</i>

06:52.758 --> 06:54.529
All of them.
Every single one of them.

06:54.529 --> 06:55.831
Are we not gonna throw
any salad in there?

06:55.831 --> 06:57.400
‐ No.
‐ 'Cause they have watercress.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.539
‐ No, no, no, no, no.
‐ How does that not go
with steak?

06:59.539 --> 07:02.945
I'm wearing
the team captain band,
and nobody seems to realize it.

07:02.945 --> 07:07.220
So best thing I can do
right now is make sure
that what they come up with

07:07.220 --> 07:08.890
isn't the worst idea
in the world.

07:10.326 --> 07:11.395
Adam:
Let's go, guys, let's go.

07:11.395 --> 07:13.199
We're all‐stars.
Let's get going.

07:13.199 --> 07:17.641
Daniel and Dino,
strongest dishes from the last
elimination challenge.

07:17.641 --> 07:22.685
I think Daniel has been
playing it safe a little bit
in these past team challenges.

07:22.685 --> 07:24.187
<i>I think he's gonna rise</i>
<i>to the occasion.</i>

07:24.187 --> 07:25.991
<i>He's gonna stay firmly</i>
<i>in control of his team.</i>

07:25.991 --> 07:29.364
Daniel: Start getting
some of the fish seared.
Take the skin off.

07:29.364 --> 07:31.335
We're at the top 12,
and they're bloody good cooks,

07:31.335 --> 07:35.511
so it's just how good
as a captain can you be
to lead your team?

07:35.511 --> 07:37.515
‐ What did he say?
‐ I don't know. I don't know
what the ( bleep ) this is.

07:37.515 --> 07:39.050
Take it off,
it's in the way.

07:39.050 --> 07:40.888
My one concern
with Dino's team

07:40.888 --> 07:42.190
is he has a lot of
strong personalities,

07:42.190 --> 07:45.062
<i>and that might sabotage</i>
<i>his team.</i>

07:45.062 --> 07:46.699
Gordon:
<i>I think Dino's great</i>
<i>individually,</i>

07:46.699 --> 07:48.135
<i>but not as a team captain.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:50.139
So is Dino gonna run
the Red Team,

07:50.139 --> 07:52.377
or the Red Team
gonna run Dino?

07:53.880 --> 07:56.886
‐ Right, Dino.
‐ Yes, Chef?

07:56.886 --> 07:58.924
Describe the dish.
What are you doing, please?

07:58.924 --> 08:00.259
‐ Cate?
‐ Yeah?

08:00.259 --> 08:02.263
‐ What are we doing?
‐ Hold on. You don't know?

08:02.263 --> 08:05.336
I know what we're doing,
but everyone has a part of it.

08:05.336 --> 08:08.677
Dino, I'm depending on you.
This is the biggest birthday
I've ever attended.

08:08.677 --> 08:10.346
You're the team captain.
I'm not asking Cate.

08:10.346 --> 08:11.883
I'm asking you, the captain.
What's the dish?

08:11.883 --> 08:14.889
Sorry, Chef.
We got a rib cap.
We're gonna...

08:17.260 --> 08:20.868
How you doing
the rib cap again?

08:20.868 --> 08:26.044
I'm doing smoked salt
and black pepper
with a little rosemary butter.

08:26.044 --> 08:28.249
That's right, we're doing
smoked salt for the rib cap.

08:28.249 --> 08:30.587
We're doing a, uh...

08:30.587 --> 08:33.092
what's the seasoning
on the mushroom?

08:33.092 --> 08:37.066
Chanterelle mushrooms have
thyme, lemon, garlic,
and butter.

08:37.066 --> 08:41.976
We got the Romanesco.
We're gonna roast that
and do it in a, uh...

08:41.976 --> 08:44.347
‐ What's Jason doing?
‐ Oh, my God.

08:44.347 --> 08:46.586
Our captain doesn't know
the dish that we're making.

08:46.586 --> 08:48.957
<i>If don't get some kind</i>
<i>of leadership here</i>
<i>on the Red Team,</i>

08:48.957 --> 08:50.459
we're going down real fast.

08:50.459 --> 08:52.030
‐ Red Team!
‐ all: Yes, Chef?

08:52.030 --> 08:53.967
‐ I need everyone in sync.
‐ all: Yes, Chef.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.639
‐ In sync.
Now get it together.
‐ all: Yes.

09:06.793 --> 09:09.464
‐ Do you know what you're doing?
‐ I do know what we're doing,
but I'm concentrating.

09:09.464 --> 09:11.301
‐ I'm all over the place.
‐ I appreciate you're
concentrating.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.007
This is a big
( bleep ) birthday.
We're all concentrating.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.978
‐ It is, Chef.
‐ You need to know your
( bleep ) inside out.

09:15.978 --> 09:17.347
‐ I do. Okay.
‐ Yeah? Okay.

09:17.347 --> 09:19.184
Jenny, what are you doing
with the potatoes?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.421
I'm making a puree, Chef,
with some crème fraiche
and roasted garlic.

09:21.421 --> 09:23.425
You're making a puree
out of those tiny potatoes?

09:23.425 --> 09:24.962
Yes, sir.

09:24.962 --> 09:28.803
You don't use a dark,
waxy potato for puree.

09:28.803 --> 09:31.676
‐ It'll be like glue,
like a paste.
‐ Okay.

09:31.676 --> 09:34.014
‐ Hey, Red Team, look at me.
All of you.
‐ Yes, Chef.

09:34.014 --> 09:35.717
You're doing some stupid
mistakes here.

09:35.717 --> 09:38.222
Dino, speak up.
Have a meeting.

09:38.222 --> 09:41.328
Hey, back together,
and on the same page.

09:41.328 --> 09:42.363
all: Thank you, Chef.

09:42.363 --> 09:44.535
( all talking at once )

09:44.535 --> 09:48.208
This is madness.
They need to start listening
to their team captain

09:48.208 --> 09:50.547
because I have a vision
of what will work.

09:50.547 --> 09:52.885
I'm gonna go with
the original idea
I wanted to do.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.889
If it ( bleep ) everybody over,
that's on me.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.559
We need to half the potatoes,

09:56.559 --> 09:58.530
hard boil them,
and then deep fry them.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.368
‐ I want that parsnip puree
right in the center.
‐ Yes.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.405
Dino:
<i>We should fan out the steak</i>
<i>because it's too big,</i>

10:03.405 --> 10:05.711
and it's gonna look clunky
on a small plate.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.915
And I want the meat
around that side.

10:07.915 --> 10:10.019
<i>They tried it their way.</i>
<i>It didn't work.</i>

10:10.019 --> 10:12.056
So now we need
to try this my way.

10:12.056 --> 10:15.262
Do me a favor, guys.
Check in with me every, like,
couple of minutes, all right?

10:15.262 --> 10:17.266
Yep.
Thanks, Captain.

10:21.776 --> 10:25.917
Red Team, Blue Team,
our VIP guests are arriving.
Let's go.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.088
( cheering )

10:28.088 --> 10:29.592
Daniel:
Let's go, guys, let's go.

10:29.592 --> 10:32.898
All right, Red Team,
you need to finish up
your prep items.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.069
Speed it up.
You gotta get in the game.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.572
Let's go.
Put it in there three minutes.

10:36.572 --> 10:38.342
Come on, we gotta hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

10:38.342 --> 10:41.448
I'm Sean McBurney.
I'm the general manager here
at Caesars Palace.

10:41.448 --> 10:44.655
<i>Having worked</i>
<i>with Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>for a number of years,</i>

10:44.655 --> 10:48.830
my expectation for tonight
is to have an unbelievable
culinary experience.

10:48.830 --> 10:50.166
Are you taking off
the ends, Jason?

10:50.166 --> 10:52.336
Leave the end piece, yeah.
Just take your time, Dino.

10:52.336 --> 10:54.274
These guys really have
to bring their A game.

10:54.274 --> 10:57.346
‐ I've been in their shoes.
I've been in that fire.
‐ Ooh!

10:57.346 --> 10:59.117
Red Team, Blue Team,
I wish you luck,

10:59.117 --> 11:01.288
but I want full flavor
on these plates tonight.

11:01.288 --> 11:04.294
Just under 15 minutes, guys.
You have a nice color on there,
Jeff, good.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.298
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ How's the barley looking?

11:06.298 --> 11:08.402
‐ The barley's looking great.
‐ How far off?

11:08.402 --> 11:10.139
‐ Seven minutes off.
‐ Seven? Hurry up then.

11:10.139 --> 11:12.778
‐ Yep.
‐ Yachecia, when your barley
goes down,

11:12.778 --> 11:14.314
the fish will go down
over the top.

11:14.314 --> 11:16.586
The blossoms are steaming.
They're about to come off.

11:16.586 --> 11:18.656
‐ We're gonna get everything
down on the plate.
‐ Yes, sir.

11:18.656 --> 11:22.931
Tonight is just the epitome
of Las Vegas, Nevada,

11:22.931 --> 11:24.200
and what we bring
to food and beverage,

11:24.200 --> 11:26.973
<i>so high expectations</i>
<i>for tonight.</i>

11:26.973 --> 11:29.845
Hey, Blue Team, let's make sure
that we're on top of the time.

11:29.845 --> 11:32.483
Guys, we need to start
pumping plates out. Come on.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.521
‐ Gordon: Newton, come on!
‐ Yes, sir.

11:34.521 --> 11:36.859
What the ( bleep ) are you
doing back there? Swimming?

11:36.859 --> 11:39.732
‐ We need help here.
‐ Okay. I can come around
and plate.

11:39.732 --> 11:43.005
Jeff:
<i>I mean, there's a lot going on.</i>
<i>We're all frazzled.</i>

11:43.005 --> 11:45.376
But, dude,
you gotta pick up the pace.

11:49.718 --> 11:51.054
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

11:51.054 --> 11:53.225
Thank you so much
for giving us this opportunity

11:53.225 --> 11:55.563
to help celebrate
this incredible year.

11:55.563 --> 11:58.235
And here's to the next 50.
To Caesars Palace.

11:58.235 --> 12:00.707
Cheers.
All hail Caesar.

12:00.707 --> 12:03.211
( cheers, applause )

12:03.211 --> 12:07.486
‐ Service, please!
‐ Really make sure that steak
is being rested, okay, guys?

12:07.486 --> 12:10.860
Cate:
<i>The rib cap needs to be</i>
<i>executed perfectly.</i>

12:10.860 --> 12:13.198
There's plenty of people
losing in Las Vegas tonight,

12:13.198 --> 12:14.969
but I don't want to be
one of them.

12:14.969 --> 12:17.908
‐ All right, let's go, let's go.
‐ Like, this meat is bleeding
too much, Dino.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.012
‐ It needs to rest more.
‐ Well, Cate, they need
their first ten,

12:20.012 --> 12:21.882
so I don't know
what you want me to do.

12:21.882 --> 12:25.222
Announcer:
<i>For tonight's Caesars Palace</i>
<i>50th anniversary dinner,</i>

12:25.222 --> 12:29.698
<i>the Red Team is serving</i>
<i>a rib cap with parsnip puree,</i>

12:29.698 --> 12:31.334
<i>chanterelle mushrooms,</i>

12:31.334 --> 12:34.040
<i>and Romanesco</i>
<i>with a hazelnut crumble.</i>

12:34.040 --> 12:37.246
Jason: Next ten.
<i>Prep was terrible,</i>

12:37.246 --> 12:40.252
but we seem to be back on track
for getting these dishes
completed

12:40.252 --> 12:41.922
<i>and served</i>
<i>to the diners on time.</i>

12:41.922 --> 12:44.862
‐ Thank you very much.
We need more steaks up.
‐ Yep.

12:44.862 --> 12:46.599
‐ Gordon: Hey, Blue Team.
‐ Yes?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.903
‐ Yes, Chef?
‐ How long are those plates
going to stay there?

12:48.903 --> 12:51.107
They've sat there
for seven minutes.

12:51.107 --> 12:52.644
We're literally waiting
on the barley to finish cooking.

12:52.644 --> 12:54.982
We've had it on there
for about a half an hour now.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.954
I'm getting nervous.
I'm getting so ( bleep )
nervous.

12:57.954 --> 13:00.292
Hey, Yachecia, how long
for that first time, the barley?

13:00.292 --> 13:03.265
It's not ready.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.904
Hey, young lady, your job's
not to get pissed off with me.

13:05.904 --> 13:09.243
It's not done.
It just won't cook.
I've been cooking it.

13:09.243 --> 13:12.416
It's going to be near
the 60th anniversary
by the time we get this out.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.420
Daniel:
<i>I'm definitely disappointed</i>
<i>in Yachecia right now.</i>

13:14.420 --> 13:17.126
She told me
she could make the barley.
She couldn't make it in time.

13:17.126 --> 13:19.765
<i>I wish she would have at least</i>
<i>told me she was having</i>
<i>a problem,</i>

13:19.765 --> 13:21.468
but she sounded
confident enough.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.407
The barley's just not
coming together, Yachecia.
We gotta scratch it.

13:24.407 --> 13:28.248
All right,
so let's go with the puree.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

13:28.248 --> 13:32.256
I hope that sea bass is good
'cause you ain't got a lot of
stuff happening on that plate.

13:32.256 --> 13:35.964
Newton:
<i>This plate is barren.</i>
<i>It's white with a white fish</i>

13:35.964 --> 13:38.636
with white puree
and a squash blossom.

13:38.636 --> 13:41.609
Announcer:
<i>The Blue Team is serving</i>
<i>a poached sea bass</i>

13:41.609 --> 13:44.313
<i>with pickled leeks,</i>
<i>turnip puree,</i>

13:44.313 --> 13:47.119
<i>a squash blossom stuffed</i>
<i>with tomatoes,</i>

13:47.119 --> 13:49.357
<i>and a purple basil</i>
<i>vinaigrette.</i>

13:49.357 --> 13:50.660
Daniel:
<i>It definitely looks</i>
<i>a little sparse,</i>

13:50.660 --> 13:52.998
<i>but this is high‐end,</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:56.471
so I'm hoping that
the presentation and the flavors

13:56.471 --> 14:00.513
will be the saving grace
and the guests won't even notice
that it's missing a component.

14:00.513 --> 14:03.886
‐ Good evening. How are you?
‐ Fine. Thank you.

14:03.886 --> 14:07.126
Now you have a beautiful
rib cap dish from the Red Team

14:07.126 --> 14:08.796
and then a sea bass
from the Blue Team.

14:08.796 --> 14:10.332
How do you think
they compare?

14:10.332 --> 14:15.442
The presentation of
the Blue Team's sea bass
was superior to me

14:15.442 --> 14:17.479
over the Red Team's steak.

14:17.479 --> 14:20.285
The presentation
of the steak, I thought
there was so much of it.

14:20.285 --> 14:21.522
I would never be able
to eat it all.

14:21.522 --> 14:24.160
<i>The flavor of</i>
<i>the Blue Team's sea bass,</i>

14:24.160 --> 14:26.632
‐ they did it to perfection.
‐ Wow.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.003
Gordon:
Great job.
Bass cooked beautifully.

14:29.003 --> 14:31.441
Even though
I prefer rib cap,

14:31.441 --> 14:36.150
I was a little taken back and
turned off by how rare it was.

14:36.150 --> 14:37.186
Dino:
Are these ready?

14:37.186 --> 14:38.656
Yeah, they gotta rest
a few minutes.

14:38.656 --> 14:41.461
Well, I need to serve some.
I need to serve some.

14:41.461 --> 14:43.532
You can't.
They gonna bleed out.
They didn't rest yet.

14:43.532 --> 14:44.835
Dino:
They're gonna bleed out,
but they need it.

14:44.835 --> 14:49.043
The Red Team's rib cap
was horribly undercooked.

14:49.043 --> 14:52.817
It was just too red, bloody.
Too much for me.

14:52.817 --> 14:54.320
What is all this in here?

14:54.320 --> 14:56.659
We're serving
just the center slices.

14:56.659 --> 14:58.763
The center slices?

14:58.763 --> 15:00.867
Are you telling me
this is all ( bleep )?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.971
We just wanted to have
a nicer presentation,

15:02.971 --> 15:05.375
so we choose the uniform cuts
that are in the middle.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.845
You're only serving
the middle?

15:06.845 --> 15:09.851
The most expensive meat
in the country?

15:09.851 --> 15:12.356
It was a question
about portion size, so‐‐

15:12.356 --> 15:14.360
If you can get two portions
out of one, that's fine.

15:14.360 --> 15:19.036
‐ Okay, understood.
‐ But you can't just trash that.
It's not chuck steak.

15:19.036 --> 15:21.174
‐ I understand.
‐ Look at that fat there.
What's that?

15:21.174 --> 15:22.409
It's not rendered out.
That's raw.

15:22.409 --> 15:25.382
But if it's that raw on the end,
what's the middle like?

15:25.382 --> 15:28.989
‐ It's gonna be
completely undone.
‐ Come on, Jason.

15:28.989 --> 15:31.094
Jason:
<i>I didn't catch it on the line.</i>
<i>That's my fault.</i>

15:31.094 --> 15:34.033
We are seriously in the weeds.
Making mistakes.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.170
‐ Who sliced it?
‐ Dino.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.774
So what did you do when
you sliced the first slice
and it's raw?

15:37.774 --> 15:39.210
‐ What do you do?
‐ Send it back.

15:39.210 --> 15:42.349
‐ That's it.
‐ Dino: <i>I am completely .</i>
<i>embarrassed</i>

15:42.349 --> 15:45.422
Because if we're sending out
raw steak, we're screwed.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.424
( bleep ) me.

15:57.146 --> 16:00.118
But if it's that raw on the end,
what's the middle like?

16:00.118 --> 16:03.224
‐ It's gonna be
completely undone.
‐ That you've sent?

16:03.224 --> 16:05.362
‐ Oh, come on, Jason.
‐ The meat is under, okay.

16:05.362 --> 16:08.067
‐ Yes, yes, we are
working on it.
‐ We're fixing it now.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.007
Cate and Eboni,
it needs a strong sear,

16:11.007 --> 16:13.411
‐ needs a blast in the oven,
then needs to rest.
‐ Okay.

16:13.411 --> 16:16.250
We told 'em they taking 'em
too quick before they can rest.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.889
‐ You've got to talk to Eboni.
‐ Okay, Chef.

16:18.889 --> 16:21.461
And that's your‐‐hey, that's
your prized possession now.
No one touches that.

16:21.461 --> 16:22.931
You got it.
Don't touch my ( bleep ) meat.

16:22.931 --> 16:25.068
Jason:
<i>We can't be serving raw meat.</i>

16:25.068 --> 16:27.272
We really need
to communicate with each other

16:27.272 --> 16:29.276
to get this train
back on its tracks.

16:29.276 --> 16:31.414
‐ Eboni, I need more meat.
‐ I'm coming, baby.

16:31.414 --> 16:33.719
You know I can't
give you undone.

16:33.719 --> 16:35.723
Pink. That's pink.
It's good.

16:35.723 --> 16:36.992
One more slice
and there's a portion.

16:36.992 --> 16:38.829
There you go.
Perfect.

16:38.829 --> 16:40.465
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, guys.

16:40.465 --> 16:43.772
Yes, Chef.

16:43.772 --> 16:46.010
Guys, you got 20 to go.
Let's go.

16:46.010 --> 16:48.147
Come on, Miss Caitlin,
you can do it. Let's go.

16:48.147 --> 16:51.254
Newton, Newton,
b‐b‐b‐b‐b‐b‐b‐b‐b‐‐

16:51.254 --> 16:53.692
Don't do that, Newton.
That freaks me out, all right?

16:53.692 --> 16:57.867
Use spoons.
That's what a MasterChef does.
Not with your big paws.

16:57.867 --> 17:01.274
‐ The presentation of the fish
was a little sloppy.
‐ Got you.

17:01.274 --> 17:03.779
‐ A bit of a miss for me.
‐ Call for service.

17:03.779 --> 17:06.284
‐ Service.
First five on this spot.
‐ No, they're not clean.

17:06.284 --> 17:09.323
‐ I just cleaned them.
‐ These aren't that clean.

17:09.323 --> 17:11.595
The winning dish for me
is the Red Team.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.968
Between the Blue Team's sea bass
and the Red Team's rib cap,
I would go for the rib cap.

17:14.968 --> 17:18.308
‐ Eboni, that meat is cooked
beautifully. Keep it going.
‐ Yes, Chef. Thank you.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.913
Dino:
<i>As messy as we might have</i>
<i>started in the beginning,</i>

17:20.913 --> 17:24.286
we came together.
We sent out a dish that I can
actually be very proud of.

17:24.286 --> 17:26.324
Fish on the line,
fish on the line.

17:26.324 --> 17:27.760
For me, the fish
was cooked perfectly.

17:27.760 --> 17:32.002
I absolutely loved the fish,
and I'm not a fish eater at all.

17:32.002 --> 17:34.206
Last plates.
Red Team, Blue Team.

17:34.206 --> 17:35.977
Jason:
Come on, folks. We can do this.
Keep pushing.

17:35.977 --> 17:37.614
Guys, come on.
Let's finish strong on this.

17:37.614 --> 17:40.018
Daniel:
Make sure every one of
those plates looks perfect.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.993
You know, unfortunately,
I got raw fish.

17:43.993 --> 17:47.567
And it's not just kind of raw,
it's really raw.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.869
I definitely have to give it
to the Red Team.

17:48.869 --> 17:50.906
Sauce it, serve it.
Wipe the plate.

17:50.906 --> 17:52.877
Service.
Thank you, service.

17:52.877 --> 17:55.716
‐ Thank you.
‐ We're done. Whoo.

17:55.716 --> 17:58.722
Jeff:
Nice job, guys, nice job.
Nice finish.

18:01.828 --> 18:05.001
Gordon:
Red Team, Blue Team.
Just go and start clearing down.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.439
Eboni:
At the end of the day,
we did it, we executed.

18:07.439 --> 18:10.880
We had a shaky
start in the beginning,
but it tastes very good.

18:10.880 --> 18:14.186
Caitlin:
Those people are gonna vote.
If our dish tastes better‐‐

18:14.186 --> 18:17.527
‐ That's all it is.
If the fish is cooked right‐‐
‐ Just let's see what happens.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.874
‐ ( applause )
‐ Red Team, Blue Team,

18:24.874 --> 18:27.880
Tonight we asked you to help
celebrate this incredible

18:27.880 --> 18:30.519
50th birthday here
at Caesars Palace.

18:30.519 --> 18:32.924
Both teams had their highs
and their lows this evening.

18:32.924 --> 18:36.497
And one team came out on top.

18:36.497 --> 18:40.405
The winner
of tonight's challenge

18:40.405 --> 18:43.879
had 68% of the votes.

18:43.879 --> 18:46.885
‐ Wow.
‐ And that winning team is...

18:52.964 --> 18:55.970
Congratulations...

18:59.778 --> 19:01.882
‐ Red Team.
‐ ( all screaming )

19:01.882 --> 19:04.554
Oh, my God!

19:04.554 --> 19:07.560
( cheers, applause )

19:07.560 --> 19:11.902
Incredible.
68% of the votes.

19:11.902 --> 19:15.275
Oh, my God.
First team challenge
I've ever won,

19:15.275 --> 19:19.049
<i>and I was team captain.</i>
<i>It paid off to choose my team.</i>

19:20.351 --> 19:22.690
Blue Team,
you know what this means.

19:22.690 --> 19:24.426
all: Yes, Chef.

19:24.426 --> 19:26.598
A dreaded pressure test.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.737
Please,
head back into your kitchen
and start clearing down.

19:29.737 --> 19:31.608
‐ Let's go.
‐ Yes, Chef.

19:31.608 --> 19:34.479
Jeff: <i>Ugh.</i>
<i>It's another team challenge</i>

19:34.479 --> 19:36.751
<i>with me being</i>
<i>on the losing end.</i>

19:36.751 --> 19:38.454
<i>The only person left</i>

19:38.454 --> 19:41.962
who can say that they're 0 and 4
right now is this guy.

19:41.962 --> 19:44.934
Vegas luck was not
on my side tonight.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.642
It wasn't even close,
and we wasted time
doing (bleep)

19:48.642 --> 19:51.781
that we didn't even need
to be doing.

19:51.781 --> 19:54.486
And the whole plate
suffered because of it.

19:54.486 --> 19:57.359
Blue Team, line up, please.
Let's go.

19:57.359 --> 20:00.298
Quick.

20:00.298 --> 20:01.635
That was a landslide
for the Red Team.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.004
‐ Absolutely.
‐ Yes, it was.

20:03.004 --> 20:05.843
‐ Twice as many votes as you.
‐ That's huge.

20:05.843 --> 20:11.688
Listen carefully.
Six of you performed
in the team tonight,

20:11.688 --> 20:15.696
but only two of you
will face head‐to‐head on

20:15.696 --> 20:18.702
in the dreaded
pressure test.

20:20.873 --> 20:24.747
As the captain,
you win with your team,
and you lose with your team,

20:24.747 --> 20:27.586
and either way,
you either get the credit
or you get the blame.

20:27.586 --> 20:31.594
So I think that it's
gonna be me and Yachecia
in this pressure test tonight.

20:31.594 --> 20:33.665
That's right,
tonight four of you
are gonna be safe

20:33.665 --> 20:36.370
and two of you will go in
to a pressure test.

20:36.370 --> 20:42.115
And that decision will be made
by your team captain, Daniel.

20:44.252 --> 20:47.425
Daniel, two names.

20:53.437 --> 20:56.945
Daniel,
you're the team captain,

20:56.945 --> 21:01.988
so which two will face
the dreaded pressure test?

21:01.988 --> 21:05.194
Uh, I would say...

21:05.194 --> 21:09.369
Yachecia and Newton.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.875
Wow, okay.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.344
You want to throw me under
the bus, I'll stand in there.

21:13.344 --> 21:15.081
Not throwing you
under the bus, man.

21:15.081 --> 21:17.419
I'll take it, let's go.

21:17.419 --> 21:20.726
You two, take your hats
and your aprons off
and follow me now.

21:20.726 --> 21:22.262
Sorry, guys.

21:22.262 --> 21:24.700
Path of least resistance.
Old man.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.905
They want me outta here.
I'm their strongest challenger.

21:26.905 --> 21:30.612
<i>Daniel, he's the captain.</i>
<i>He should be the one on</i>
<i>this pressure test.</i>

21:30.612 --> 21:32.583
<i>What a lucky</i>
<i>son of a bitch he is.</i>

21:32.583 --> 21:34.554
Thanks for driving the bus
over me, fella.

21:35.789 --> 21:37.225
Gordon:
Follow me.

21:37.225 --> 21:40.465
I have no idea what they're
getting ready to throw at us...

21:40.465 --> 21:45.241
‐ Line up, please.
‐ ...because this is Vegas,
and it is go big or go home.

21:50.619 --> 21:55.161
Newton and Yachecia,
welcome to the Nobu Villa.

21:55.161 --> 21:58.802
‐ Beautiful.
‐ This place has one of
the most spectacular views

21:58.802 --> 22:00.806
of the Las Vegas Strip.

22:04.279 --> 22:08.622
<i>As you can see tonight,</i>
<i>"MasterChef" has literally</i>
<i>taken over Las Vegas.</i>

22:08.622 --> 22:13.464
‐ I see.
‐ The view that way...
is spectacular.

22:13.464 --> 22:15.134
both: Yes, Chef.

22:15.134 --> 22:19.409
But the view from where
we're standing is not so good.

22:19.409 --> 22:23.250
After this grueling
pressure test,

22:23.250 --> 22:26.490
we're gonna take
one of you back with us
to the MasterChef kitchen,

22:26.490 --> 22:30.164
and the other
will be left right here.

22:30.164 --> 22:33.505
Newton, Yachecia,
before we go any further,

22:33.505 --> 22:36.844
you're going to need these.
Please.

22:36.844 --> 22:40.184
Yachecia: <i>I thrive</i>
<i>in pressure situations.</i>

22:40.184 --> 22:43.123
I've been in a lot of pressure
situations in my life.

22:43.123 --> 22:45.394
I've been in a lot of pressure
situations in this kitchen.

22:45.394 --> 22:48.200
<i>But Newton is a man's man.</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:51.541
He is a rancher.
He is not going out
without a fight.

22:54.145 --> 22:57.085
This is not a challenge
for the faint‐hearted.

22:57.085 --> 23:00.224
To call this dish "fancy"

23:00.224 --> 23:03.163
is an understatement.

23:03.163 --> 23:05.167
It is...

23:06.604 --> 23:08.340
Ooh.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.646
Christina:
...champagne poached oysters.

23:10.646 --> 23:14.019
This dish could easily
set you back $100

23:14.019 --> 23:15.822
in a restaurant here
in Las Vegas.

23:15.822 --> 23:17.660
‐ Ooh.
‐ The oysters,

23:17.660 --> 23:19.530
plucked from the sea
of British Columbia.

23:19.530 --> 23:23.304
They need to be shucked just so.
No shell, not pierced.

23:23.304 --> 23:27.211
Poached for just a second
in that beautiful champagne
cooking liquid.

23:27.211 --> 23:29.850
The capellini
you're making from scratch,

23:29.850 --> 23:34.259
and that pasta dough needs
to be rolled out and cut finely.

23:34.259 --> 23:37.733
That tarragon beurre blanc,
rich and acidic.

23:37.733 --> 23:40.505
Just to drape itself
over the oyster.

23:40.505 --> 23:42.408
Those cucumber batons,

23:42.408 --> 23:45.749
don't think you're gonna get
anything less than perfect
knife work by us tonight.

23:45.749 --> 23:48.087
And those dollops
of caviar on top,

23:48.087 --> 23:51.259
beautiful,
delicate plating.

23:51.259 --> 23:55.969
This is Las Vegas
on a plate.

23:55.969 --> 23:59.142
There's a lot to accomplish
with a lot on the line, guys.

23:59.142 --> 24:03.551
And we're expecting
a perfect replication
of this stunning dish.

24:03.551 --> 24:06.724
Both of you, it's time
to head to your stations.
Let's go.

24:06.724 --> 24:09.730
Newton: <i>You know, this ain't</i>
<i>meat and potatoes, fellers.</i>

24:09.730 --> 24:11.734
This is luxury.

24:11.734 --> 24:14.874
<i>This is timing and finesse.</i>

24:14.874 --> 24:18.046
I got the finesse of
a bull in a china closet,
but not tonight.

24:18.046 --> 24:21.052
Christina:
At your stations
you have everything you need.

24:21.052 --> 24:25.261
And you'll have 45 minutes
to impeccably replicate

24:25.261 --> 24:27.265
this decadent
Las Vegas oyster dish.

24:29.436 --> 24:32.141
‐ Are you two ready?
‐ both: Yes, Chef.

24:32.141 --> 24:34.780
You better be.
Your 45 minutes...

24:34.780 --> 24:36.784
‐ Good luck.
‐ ...starts...

24:36.784 --> 24:39.222
‐ Best wishes.
‐ ...now.

24:45.836 --> 24:47.506
This is serious business
right now.

24:47.506 --> 24:49.142
You have Yachecia
and you have Newton

24:49.142 --> 24:50.846
fighting for
their culinary lives.

24:50.846 --> 24:55.856
Talk about pressure.
Yachecia is a preacher
from Detroit, Michigan,

24:55.856 --> 24:57.960
Newton a rancher from Texas.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.032
This is a dish that professional
chefs would shudder at.

25:02.301 --> 25:03.972
I've never made anything
like this before,

25:03.972 --> 25:05.775
so this is a first for me.

25:05.775 --> 25:07.779
We gotta drive over
a hundred miles to a good grocer

25:07.779 --> 25:09.382
to get good, fresh oysters.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.656
Champagne poached oysters,
the ultimate Vegas dish.

25:12.656 --> 25:15.294
‐ Big time.
‐ Christina: Gordon, there are
so many different elements.

25:15.294 --> 25:17.733
Gordon: This thing
is all about the timing
so the a to zed of this,

25:17.733 --> 25:19.904
first, get your pasta done
and get that resting up.

25:19.904 --> 25:22.108
Then open up double the amount
of oysters you need.

25:22.108 --> 25:23.811
Get that beautiful tarragon
beurre blanc made.

25:23.811 --> 25:27.318
With five minutes to go,
pasta, oysters,

25:27.318 --> 25:29.757
cucumber, caviar,
beurre blanc.

25:29.757 --> 25:33.998
Christina:
It's gonna come down to finesse,
timing, and confidence.

25:33.998 --> 25:39.108
But one thing's for sure,
one of them is not coming back
to the MasterChef kitchen.

25:39.108 --> 25:40.946
Whoo.

25:40.946 --> 25:43.851
Just over
31 minutes remaining.

25:43.851 --> 25:44.954
Young lady,
how are you feeling?

25:44.954 --> 25:47.291
I'm feeling the pressure.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.295
How many times a week
do you eat oysters?

25:49.295 --> 25:51.199
Not very many.

25:51.199 --> 25:54.372
‐ What about poaching oysters?
‐ No, never poached
oysters before.

25:54.372 --> 25:56.409
‐ I've poached fish.
‐ Have you eaten oysters?

25:56.409 --> 25:59.248
I've eaten a lot of oysters.
Just haven't shucked them
myself.

25:59.248 --> 26:02.254
This is a dish
that is built on
last‐minute finesse.

26:02.254 --> 26:05.494
There's a lot of times I've had
to finesse a sermon last minute

26:05.494 --> 26:08.601
because something happened
in the service that
I wasn't expecting,

26:08.601 --> 26:10.538
and so I'm treating this
the same way.

26:10.538 --> 26:11.674
Gotcha. 30 minutes to go.
Good luck.

26:11.674 --> 26:14.045
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ How we doing, Newton?

26:14.045 --> 26:16.550
‐ Doing great here, boss.
‐ I don't imagine you see
too many oyster dishes

26:16.550 --> 26:19.288
of this caliber hanging out
next to the cows, do you?

26:19.288 --> 26:22.729
No, we do not.
It's just not part of what
I really cook at home,

26:22.729 --> 26:23.731
so this is a great
challenge for me.

26:23.731 --> 26:25.735
It's got me out
of my comfort zone.

26:25.735 --> 26:28.541
‐ That's what makes us stronger.
‐ How are you prioritizing all
the elements of this dish?

26:28.541 --> 26:30.377
I got all my stuff ready
for the beurre blanc.

26:30.377 --> 26:31.881
I got my pasta setting up
right here.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.551
Getting everything prepared
so when we come together,

26:33.551 --> 26:34.820
I don't have to stop
and do anything.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.224
Your culinary life
is on the line.

26:37.224 --> 26:39.228
‐ Let's do it, okay?
Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.573
Newton right now is setting
himself up really well.

26:44.573 --> 26:46.911
He has all of his oysters
beautifully lined up.

26:46.911 --> 26:49.516
I'm concerned there's a little
bit of shell in some of them.

26:49.516 --> 26:51.453
Put them in the pan,
pour the champagne on,

26:51.453 --> 26:53.423
‐ and that gets rid
of the little fragments.
‐ That's true.

26:53.423 --> 26:55.194
Gordon:
Yachecia is in the zone,
let me tell you.

26:55.194 --> 26:56.964
She is composed, confident.

26:56.964 --> 27:01.607
But her voice sounds shaky.
She's never been this on edge.

27:01.607 --> 27:05.214
22 1/2 minutes gone,
22 1/2 minutes to go.

27:05.214 --> 27:08.019
Get yourself set up
for those last five minutes.

27:08.019 --> 27:10.224
You know how important
they're gonna be.

27:10.224 --> 27:12.996
Those last five minutes
are crucial.

27:12.996 --> 27:16.035
If they drop your pasta
too soon, it's over.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.206
Your drop those oysters
too soon, it's over.

27:18.206 --> 27:20.912
Your beurre blanc is out
of balance flavor‐wise,
it's over.

27:20.912 --> 27:23.383
They've only got
one chance to do it.

27:23.383 --> 27:25.889
When they roll it down
to that thin capellini,

27:25.889 --> 27:30.732
you take your pan handle,
lightly flour, and let it hang.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.602
‐ Aarón: Yes.
‐ Gordon: What they're doing
is they're rolling it

27:32.602 --> 27:35.274
and then dumping it
into a big lump.

27:35.274 --> 27:38.614
Now with this humidity here,
the pasta is gonna stick
together again.

27:38.614 --> 27:40.819
That's the worst thing
you can do to the pasta

27:40.819 --> 27:42.388
is leave it clumped up
on a board.

27:42.388 --> 27:45.628
Look at Yachecia's pasta.
It's like a ball of hair.

27:45.628 --> 27:47.632
Just under ten minutes
remaining.

27:47.632 --> 27:48.968
Damn it.

27:52.809 --> 27:56.082
Yachecia's making
her beurre blanc.

27:56.082 --> 27:58.921
If it's too thin,
it's gonna run right off
the surface.

27:58.921 --> 28:00.490
‐ If it's too thick...
‐ Aarón: Yep.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.963
It's gonna coat too much,
and that delicate balance

28:02.963 --> 28:06.369
is gonna be a huge point
of jeopardy here tonight.

28:06.369 --> 28:08.774
I'm afraid
the pressure's
getting to Yachecia.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.979
She looks very concerned
right now.

28:10.979 --> 28:14.252
‐ Aarón: Is she cracking
under pressure?
‐ Christina: I don't know.

28:14.252 --> 28:16.657
I mean, this is where
you really gotta compose
yourself right now.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.470
Christina:
Newton is going to roll out
more pasta.

28:23.470 --> 28:26.777
What happened with the first two
sheets he rolled out?

28:26.777 --> 28:29.148
Right now I'm making a little
bit of extra pasta to make sure
I have enough.

28:29.148 --> 28:30.818
It needs to be perfect.

28:30.818 --> 28:33.624
This is incredible.
Newton is falling behind.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.496
Look at the way Newton
is treating that pasta, though.

28:36.496 --> 28:39.268
He has it layed out beautifully.
It's well‐floured.

28:39.268 --> 28:42.776
He can sense the humidity,
but my concern with Newton,

28:42.776 --> 28:44.780
he's doing so great
on his pasta,

28:44.780 --> 28:47.017
but half his elements
he still needs to make.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.055
His beurre blanc,
his poaching liquid.

28:49.055 --> 28:51.225
Gordon:
Newton's oysters
are still in the shell,

28:51.225 --> 28:53.864
but they're still connected.
He hasn't released them yet.

28:53.864 --> 28:55.868
He shucked the oysters
and didn't release?

28:55.868 --> 28:57.237
That's part
of the shucking process.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.910
Gordon:
Yachecia's pasta's in.
That's early.

28:59.910 --> 29:02.649
Five minutes remaining.

29:02.649 --> 29:05.020
This is it.

29:05.020 --> 29:08.360
This dish is gonna come down
to the finest of details.

29:13.671 --> 29:16.844
What's she doing?
Salt the water before
the pasta goes in.

29:16.844 --> 29:19.015
Guys, I'm worried
about the consistency
of Newton's beurre blanc.

29:19.015 --> 29:21.854
So much vinegar.
There's not enough butter.

29:21.854 --> 29:23.390
It looks like water.

29:25.327 --> 29:26.830
Too thin.
Way too thin.

29:26.830 --> 29:29.035
That beurre blanc
has to hug the noodle.

29:31.573 --> 29:36.416
Think about poaching
those oysters softly, gently.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.253
Christina:
Watch those oysters.

29:38.253 --> 29:40.892
‐ Gordon: Two minutes, guys!
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.
You can do this.

29:40.892 --> 29:43.396
‐ Aarón: Gotta get going.
‐ Gordon: Come on, please.

29:43.396 --> 29:45.535
Steady hands, Newton.
There you go.

29:45.535 --> 29:48.741
Get those oysters on.

29:48.741 --> 29:52.181
Watch that pasta.
Oh!

29:52.181 --> 29:54.085
‐ Aarón: Push.
‐ Gordon: Come on, Newton.

29:54.085 --> 29:57.091
Remember the skirt of the oyster
goes on the outside.

29:57.091 --> 29:58.928
This is anybody's game.

29:58.928 --> 30:00.765
Christina:
At this point, 50/50.

30:00.765 --> 30:03.604
45 seconds remaining.

30:03.604 --> 30:06.109
‐ Christina: You've got time.
‐ Caviar, come on. Caviar.

30:06.109 --> 30:08.279
‐ Aarón: Caviar takes some time.
‐ Gordon: Gently, now.

30:08.279 --> 30:13.123
Don't knock that plate.
You'll tip it over.

30:13.123 --> 30:14.559
Newton can't open
his caviar tin.

30:14.559 --> 30:16.797
‐ ( grunts )
‐ 15 seconds to go.

30:18.433 --> 30:21.072
I can't.
Can't get ( bleep ).

30:21.072 --> 30:23.677
Come on, Newton.
You can do this.

30:23.677 --> 30:26.115
Oh, no.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.119
Damn it.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.139
The stakes are higher
than ever.

30:38.139 --> 30:42.214
Champagne poached oysters,
the ultimate Vegas dish.

30:42.214 --> 30:46.189
Two home cooks,
one of them is not coming back
to the MasterChef kitchen.

30:46.189 --> 30:47.859
‐ 30 seconds to go.
‐ Come on, Newton.

30:47.859 --> 30:49.529
Let's go, let's push.

30:50.865 --> 30:52.167
Newton can't open
his caviar tin.

30:52.167 --> 30:54.171
‐ ( grunts )
‐ Gordon: 15 seconds to go.

30:56.209 --> 30:58.847
I can't.
Can't get ( bleep ).

30:58.847 --> 31:01.152
Come on, Newton.
You can do this.

31:01.152 --> 31:02.922
Oh, no.

31:02.922 --> 31:04.091
Damn it.

31:04.091 --> 31:07.130
Five, four, three...

31:07.130 --> 31:10.136
‐ Judges: Two, one.
‐ Gordon: And stop.
Hands in the air.

31:12.609 --> 31:15.681
Oh, man.
Well done, both of you.

31:18.186 --> 31:20.524
Yachecia,
how are you feeling?

31:20.524 --> 31:22.060
Whoo, stressed.

31:22.060 --> 31:23.864
Is everything on the plate?

31:23.864 --> 31:29.208
Every component is there,
but I knocked my caviar
off the oyster.

31:29.208 --> 31:31.680
‐ Gordon: Right. Newton?
‐ I didn't get it all completed.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.888
I couldn't get the top
of my caviar off.

31:35.888 --> 31:39.361
Aarón:
Newton, Yachecia, it's time
to taste your oyster dishes

31:39.361 --> 31:42.234
and find out who has played
a winning hand,

31:42.234 --> 31:46.910
and who is about to lose it all
right here in Vegas.

31:46.910 --> 31:49.916
Please bring your dishes
around to the front.

31:53.022 --> 31:55.393
That was a quick
45 minutes.

31:55.393 --> 31:57.565
‐ Uh, yeah.
‐ Well done, both of you.

31:57.565 --> 32:00.938
Newton, please bring
your dish forward.

32:00.938 --> 32:02.508
Mentally, I'm devastated.

32:02.508 --> 32:04.979
<i>Surgical precision</i>
<i>up to one minute,</i>

32:04.979 --> 32:08.219
and I let a jar lid
take me down.

32:08.219 --> 32:11.058
All right, Newton.
How'd you do?

32:11.058 --> 32:12.929
Awful.

32:12.929 --> 32:16.235
I got down to the very end,
and I couldn't get the lid off
the caviar,

32:16.235 --> 32:18.841
and I struggled with that
for the last 60 seconds.

32:18.841 --> 32:21.245
Now it also looks like
you're missing one of
the other elements.

32:21.245 --> 32:23.684
The beurre blanc.

32:23.684 --> 32:26.288
Listen, we don't call this
a pressure test for nothing.

32:26.288 --> 32:29.261
‐ Right.
‐ It's the time to rise
to the occasion

32:29.261 --> 32:31.265
or be sent packing.

32:31.265 --> 32:34.204
All right,
let's take a deeper look.

32:34.204 --> 32:36.576
So, cucumber batons.

32:36.576 --> 32:40.150
A little bit
all over the place.

32:40.150 --> 32:42.655
We are looking for
three beautiful batons.

32:42.655 --> 32:45.493
Basically three versions
of this one right here.

32:45.493 --> 32:48.099
How long did you poach
these oysters?

32:48.099 --> 32:50.103
Less than a minute.

32:56.348 --> 32:59.321
I mean,
it's beautiful.

32:59.321 --> 33:02.461
<i>It's plump, it's rich,</i>
<i>it has that ending flavor</i>
<i>of champagne.</i>

33:02.461 --> 33:05.467
It's decadent.
You nailed the oyster poaching.

33:07.872 --> 33:11.746
Now, this pasta,
beautiful width.

33:14.953 --> 33:19.394
Your pasta's cooked beautifully,
almost to perfection.

33:19.394 --> 33:22.300
I can taste just that small
coating of butter.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.473
Listen, the reality is
the dish is unfinished.

33:25.473 --> 33:27.512
You're missing the caviar,
you're missing the beurre blanc.

33:27.512 --> 33:31.018
Those are two important
elements of the dish.

33:31.018 --> 33:34.659
The real question is going to be
are the items you put on

33:34.659 --> 33:36.830
gonna be good enough
to keep you in the competition?

33:36.830 --> 33:38.834
Thank you, Chef.

33:41.005 --> 33:43.342
Newton, rancher.

33:43.342 --> 33:46.883
The wisest, most mature man
in the competition, correct?

33:46.883 --> 33:49.622
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Are you happy with the poach
of the oyster?

33:49.622 --> 33:51.025
I am.

33:51.025 --> 33:52.695
When I brought 'em out
with a spoon,

33:52.695 --> 33:54.866
tried to make sure that there
was no shells in the bottom,

33:54.866 --> 33:57.370
allowed them to drain off
on the side of the pan.

33:57.370 --> 34:01.245
The oyster is plump.
Pasta, it's perfect.

34:01.245 --> 34:03.951
It's well‐cooked.
It's seasoned properly.

34:03.951 --> 34:06.623
I love the strands.
They're individual.

34:06.623 --> 34:10.496
They speak to the precision
in the pasta‐making.
I love that.

34:10.496 --> 34:13.436
Apart from the richness
that the beurre blanc
will give flavor‐wise,

34:13.436 --> 34:16.710
it has much needed acid.

34:16.710 --> 34:20.784
That vinegar would be such
a welcome sight on this dish

34:20.784 --> 34:22.387
'cause it would have
just opened it up.

34:22.387 --> 34:23.690
Sadly,
'cause it's not there,

34:23.690 --> 34:26.563
it's really sinking
the oyster dish.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.567
Yes, Chef.
Thank you.

34:31.740 --> 34:33.476
<i>I think I got a chance,</i>

34:33.476 --> 34:34.979
even without
those key components.

34:34.979 --> 34:37.417
<i>Caviar is just</i>
<i>an accoutrement on it.</i>

34:37.417 --> 34:40.156
<i>We didn't make it,</i>
<i>and so I'm just hoping</i>

34:40.156 --> 34:43.730
<i>that the judges will base</i>
<i>this decision on what</i>
<i>I actually have made.</i>

34:43.730 --> 34:46.903
Yachecia, please,
bring those oysters up.
Thank you.

34:48.272 --> 34:49.441
Newton is missing
a few elements,

34:49.441 --> 34:51.946
but I got all five elements
on there.

34:51.946 --> 34:55.721
I'm hoping that's enough
to give me an advantage.

34:55.721 --> 34:57.892
‐ Tough one, this one.
‐ Yes, Chef.

34:57.892 --> 34:59.294
Something that took me
years to master,

34:59.294 --> 35:00.597
and you guys had 45 minutes,

35:00.597 --> 35:02.702
so respect for both of you.
Let's get that right.

35:02.702 --> 35:07.377
‐ Thank you.
‐ Okay, let me ask you
something really important.

35:07.377 --> 35:08.714
What's wrong with the dish?

35:08.714 --> 35:10.718
What's wrong with the dish?

35:13.657 --> 35:14.926
Um...

35:16.730 --> 35:19.869
Yachecia, there's something
that you can see a mile away.

35:30.924 --> 35:33.964
Okay, let me ask you
something really important.

35:33.964 --> 35:35.601
What's wrong with the dish?

35:35.601 --> 35:37.772
Um...

35:39.609 --> 35:41.946
That you can see
a mile away.

35:45.453 --> 35:47.290
Your beurre blanc
is way too thin

35:47.290 --> 35:50.964
'cause it's just literally
washed off the oysters.

35:50.964 --> 35:54.304
<i>Visually, also,</i>
<i>I think your pasta's too thin,</i>

35:54.304 --> 35:57.812
<i>and that was caused</i>
<i>by stretching your pasta</i>
<i>through your machine.</i>

35:57.812 --> 36:01.485
‐ Yachecia: <i>Okay.</i>
‐ Gordon: <i>The oysters, how long</i>
<i>did you poach them for?</i>

36:01.485 --> 36:03.757
I poached them just over
a minute.

36:05.426 --> 36:07.765
The pasta never needs to be
rolled that tight.

36:07.765 --> 36:09.702
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay?

36:09.702 --> 36:13.108
When you throw it on your board
and then toss flour through it

36:13.108 --> 36:16.950
the humidity tonight
sticks it back together.

36:16.950 --> 36:18.820
And that's why your pasta's
got all clumpy.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.822
Okay.

36:24.464 --> 36:27.003
Yachecia, the oysters
are poached beautifully.

36:27.003 --> 36:28.974
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ The saltiness of the caviar

36:28.974 --> 36:31.278
and that refreshing crunch
of the cucumber's delicious.

36:31.278 --> 36:33.349
Beurre blanc needs to be
a bit thicker.

36:33.349 --> 36:35.152
The letdown tonight
is your pasta.

36:35.152 --> 36:36.823
There's way too much
in the shell.

36:36.823 --> 36:39.695
It's greasy as opposed
to being coated in that butter.

36:39.695 --> 36:41.164
But it's a very strong effort.

36:41.164 --> 36:42.968
Is it good enough
to keep you in?

36:42.968 --> 36:44.939
‐ I don't know yet.
‐ Yes, Chef.

36:44.939 --> 36:46.943
Thank you.

36:49.314 --> 36:50.784
‐ Yachecia...
‐ Chef.

36:50.784 --> 36:53.355
...visually for me, you can see
that the oyster plumped up,

36:53.355 --> 36:55.026
‐ which is a beautiful sight.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

36:55.026 --> 36:56.562
The skirt is kind of
opened up.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.065
That leads me to believe
that there's gonna be

36:58.065 --> 37:00.671
a lot of beautiful juice
still left inside.

37:03.643 --> 37:06.415
Here's the deal.
The oyster's cooked perfectly.

37:06.415 --> 37:09.421
The right proportion of caviar
to the oyster is right on.

37:09.421 --> 37:11.926
I can't find the beurre blanc.

37:11.926 --> 37:15.199
I think the refinement
element of the garnishes
is definitely not there.

37:15.199 --> 37:18.005
I think you really suffered
from some time management
at the end.

37:18.005 --> 37:20.176
‐ Yachecia: Yes.
‐ Aarón: But the question
I have to ask,

37:20.176 --> 37:22.881
has this oyster delivered?

37:22.881 --> 37:25.019
‐ And I think it has.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

37:25.019 --> 37:26.990
Thank you.

37:26.990 --> 37:28.727
Yachecia:
<i>Newton's pasta is perfect.</i>

37:28.727 --> 37:30.797
<i>Newton's oyster is perfect.</i>

37:30.797 --> 37:33.168
Does that outweigh what I did?
I got all five elements,

37:33.168 --> 37:34.905
but they weren't all perfect.

37:34.905 --> 37:36.576
<i>I don't know.</i>

37:36.576 --> 37:38.880
<i>The last head‐to‐head</i>
<i>pressure test I was in,</i>

37:38.880 --> 37:41.184
<i>it was clear</i>
<i>that I was the winner.</i>

37:41.184 --> 37:43.188
This pressure test
is clear as mud.

37:45.594 --> 37:47.564
One of you
will be coming back with us

37:47.564 --> 37:50.604
to Los Angeles
into the MasterChef kitchen.

37:50.604 --> 37:54.010
The other will be staying
here in Las Vegas.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.749
Please give us a moment.

37:56.749 --> 38:00.222
I mean, listen,
both of them have their faults.

38:00.222 --> 38:01.526
‐ Both of them
had their highlights.
‐ Yep.

38:01.526 --> 38:03.663
Gordon:
Newton nailed the portion.

38:03.663 --> 38:07.070
Christina:
Newton's pasta was beautiful.

38:07.070 --> 38:09.240
His oyster poaching
was beautiful.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.478
Newton:
<i>Ten months ago,</i>
<i>I had a stroke,</i>

38:11.478 --> 38:14.184
and spent most of January
sick and in the hospital.

38:14.184 --> 38:17.156
<i>It's a huge sacrifice</i>
<i>for my family to be here,</i>

38:17.156 --> 38:20.597
<i>and for that, I owe them</i>
<i>the MasterChef trophy.</i>

38:20.597 --> 38:23.335
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>I can go back home right now.</i>

38:23.335 --> 38:26.742
Arguably, the most difficult
aspect of this dish was
nailing the oyster,

38:26.742 --> 38:30.182
and I think Yachecia
really did a great job.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.686
Christina:
<i>But there were clumsy elements.</i>

38:31.686 --> 38:33.756
‐ Gordon: <i>Her pasta was greasy.</i>
‐ Aarón: Yeah.

38:33.756 --> 38:35.961
Gordon:
<i>The proportion of pasta</i>
<i>to oyster is way off.</i>

38:35.961 --> 38:38.465
Yeah, but she did get a little
bit of that beurre blanc
on there

38:38.465 --> 38:40.804
with that much‐needed vinegar
that helped.

38:40.804 --> 38:44.110
Yachecia:
<i>Food and ministry</i>
<i>are the two elements</i>

38:44.110 --> 38:46.214
<i>that I'm most passionate about.</i>

38:46.214 --> 38:48.987
Now I have the opportunity
to take my food dream

38:48.987 --> 38:50.289
to a whole different level.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.059
This is extremely
important to me.

38:52.059 --> 38:54.665
Who nailed the oysters
the best?

38:54.665 --> 38:57.971
Because they both
had errors,
so it is down

38:57.971 --> 38:59.975
to the smallest of details
like we've never had before,

38:59.975 --> 39:01.579
‐ that one element, the poach.
‐ Yeah.

39:01.579 --> 39:04.417
‐ But it's not just
the poached oyster, guys.
‐ But it is.

39:04.417 --> 39:07.558
‐ That's 30 seconds of cooking.
‐ But it is because they both
got the oysters on there.

39:07.558 --> 39:10.429
I know, but still that‐‐
it also had the biggest pitfall.

39:10.429 --> 39:12.133
Gordon:
No one's cooking the caviar.

39:12.133 --> 39:14.270
That was something
that we gave them.

39:14.270 --> 39:16.274
If it was just a pasta challenge
or just a poached oyster
challenge‐‐

39:16.274 --> 39:19.447
Yeah, but it wasn't though.
It wasn't.

39:19.447 --> 39:21.451
No, no, no, no, no.

39:21.451 --> 39:23.923
The most difficult things
were the pasta and the cooking
of the oyster.

39:23.923 --> 39:25.927
And who did the better job?

39:30.670 --> 39:32.941
Gordon:
Both of you,
Yachecia and Newton,

39:32.941 --> 39:35.614
turned in
an incredible performance,
let's get that right.

39:35.614 --> 39:38.686
Watching you fight with
that passion, the determination,

39:38.686 --> 39:42.995
and then the grit to nail it
was extraordinary.

39:42.995 --> 39:45.466
But now, unfortunately,

39:45.466 --> 39:50.276
we do have to say goodbye
to one of you.

39:50.276 --> 39:52.614
Yachecia,
oysters poached beautifully.

39:52.614 --> 39:55.185
Beurre blanc,
slightly too thin.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.622
Caviar, beautiful.

39:56.622 --> 39:58.358
Pasta,
you rolled too thinly,

39:58.358 --> 40:00.697
overcooked,
slightly too greasy.

40:00.697 --> 40:03.736
Newton,
your pasta was perfect.

40:03.736 --> 40:06.809
You poached the oyster lovely.
Beurre blanc went astray,

40:06.809 --> 40:08.913
and then you missed the end
with the caviar.

40:08.913 --> 40:13.155
Yachecia, Newton,
it came down to the finest,

40:13.155 --> 40:14.892
the smallest of details,

40:14.892 --> 40:20.670
and there is a slight difference
in the technical ability.

40:20.670 --> 40:25.279
The person who executed
their champagne oyster dish

40:25.279 --> 40:27.416
just a touch better,

40:27.416 --> 40:31.424
the person returning
to the MasterChef kitchen...

40:40.309 --> 40:42.313
is...

40:50.597 --> 40:52.066
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

40:52.066 --> 40:54.571
<i>the winning home cook</i>
<i>from Vegas returns.</i>

40:54.571 --> 40:56.141
Please welcome back...

40:58.111 --> 41:00.482

‐ Crawfish.

41:00.482 --> 41:02.486
‐ It's alive.
‐ <i>It's a challenging...</i>

41:02.486 --> 41:05.459
‐ Gotta work quick, guys.
‐ <i>...Gordon Ramsay skills test.</i>

41:05.459 --> 41:07.898
‐ Whoa.
‐ This is impossible.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.768
‐ Whoo.
‐ <i>But when the top 11...</i>

41:09.768 --> 41:11.772
So gross.
( shudders )

41:11.772 --> 41:13.776
‐ <i>...find themselves...</i>
‐ Ahh!

41:13.776 --> 41:16.080
<i>...in hot water,</i>
<i>who will end up...</i>

41:16.080 --> 41:18.151
‐ ( shrieks )
‐ <i>...shell‐shocked?</i>

41:18.151 --> 41:19.955
Eboni is finished.

41:19.955 --> 41:20.957
( shudders )
