WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.672
Previously on 90210:
You have to be
so incredibly brave

00:04.713 --> 00:06.590
to trust somebody you just met
to carry your baby.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.510
I'd really like the chance
to be that person.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.303
It's official.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.429
I'm pregnant.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.181
I'm pregnant!

00:14.222 --> 00:16.350
(laughing):
I'm pregnant.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.560
The whole time that Naomi was
pushing me to flirt with Mark,

00:18.602 --> 00:20.187
I thought
he liked you.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.897
Look, after what almost
went down with Dixon,

00:21.939 --> 00:23.148
I am not about
to lose another friend.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.859
Okay, well then
let's make a pact.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.527
All right?
Mark is off limits.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.571
Okay, Mark is off limits.
Deal.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.448
Divorce sucks,
but it's the right thing.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.533
Yeah, no, it is.

00:32.573 --> 00:33.701
We're too young.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.286
I'm gonna miss you, Naomi.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.078
Dude, what's your problem?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.413
My problem is
everyone asking me

00:38.455 --> 00:39.748
what my problem is.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.626
That kid that I hit

00:42.668 --> 00:44.419
yesterday decided not
to press charges,

00:44.461 --> 00:46.254
so I'm off the hook.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.840
Hey, that's-that's fantastic.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.216
Our physics final's coming up.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.342
Once you figure out
the answers,

00:50.384 --> 00:52.386
just text them
to the rest of the guys.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.387
You need me to go.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.889
Yeah, it's just that

00:54.930 --> 00:57.349
my stepson's gonna
be home soon and...

00:57.391 --> 00:58.475
Got it.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.643
(door closes)

00:59.685 --> 01:02.646
CAMPBELL:
I know. Yeah, I know.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.147
They're withholding the semester
grades because they know

01:04.188 --> 01:05.105
we were cheating.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.316
It's gonna come out.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.360
Everyone at Cronus
is gonna be okay.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.528
I've set Navid Shirazi up

01:09.570 --> 01:11.071
to take the fall
for the whole thing.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.750
(sighs)

01:22.791 --> 01:23.876
Hey.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.210
Thanks for stopping by.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.253
Of course.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.671
Hey, you mind if I

01:27.713 --> 01:30.298
use your shower
while I'm here?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.467
Did you get sweaty on the way
over or something?

01:32.509 --> 01:33.844
Our water heater
at home is broken.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.804
Instead of calling a
professional repairman,

01:35.846 --> 01:37.848
Liam and Mark see it
as a great opportunity

01:37.890 --> 01:39.683
to compare the size of their...

01:39.725 --> 01:41.852
prowess at fixing things.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.771
Anyway, what's up?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.564
I'm worried about Naomi.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.400
She's been a little off
the last couple of days.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.402
And I think I figured out why.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.947
I found this
in the drawer.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.364
Oh, man.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.657
Her divorce papers?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.492
Yeah.
She hasn't said anything?

01:57.534 --> 02:00.079
No, she's just been moping
around and watching TV.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.456
Hasn't returned
any calls for work.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.420
Am I interrupting something?

02:11.423 --> 02:12.758
(sighs)

02:14.802 --> 02:17.345
You know, we're here

02:17.387 --> 02:18.889
if you need to talk or...

02:18.931 --> 02:21.475
if you're feeling
depressed.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.893
Why would you think
I'm depressed?

02:22.935 --> 02:25.896
Um, well, why have
you been ignoring

02:25.938 --> 02:27.648
your business calls?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.566
I was gonna get around to them.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.569
Fine... if you got a bee
in your bonnet.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.821
Wedding, (sighs)

02:33.862 --> 02:34.780
wedding,

02:34.822 --> 02:37.574
engagement party...

02:37.616 --> 02:39.200
another wedding.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.996
Media company looking
for a planner

02:42.037 --> 02:45.290
for unspecified events.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.668
I will call Jordan Welland
back right now.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.877
Happy?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.545
If you are.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.797
I couldn't be better.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.842
I have work to do.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.136
Biggest red flag?

02:57.176 --> 02:59.429
She hasn't even been
plucking her eyebrows.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.474
I know.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.434
MAN (on TV): That means
she's coming. This is it.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.520
DIXON: Hey, guys,
Michaela's flash mob

03:06.561 --> 03:07.980
video is, like,
750,000...

03:08.022 --> 03:09.397
WOMAN (on TV): After 14 hours
of grueling labor...

03:09.439 --> 03:10.732
...views.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.942
Oh, wow, that's great.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.902
...the baby's head begins
to fully emerge.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.697
Whoa, guys, are you actually
watching this on purpose?

03:16.738 --> 03:17.698
SILVER:
Dixon, please!

03:17.739 --> 03:19.366
This is beautiful.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.617
Do you want to feel
the top of her head?

03:20.659 --> 03:23.537
(vomiting)
MAN:
Keep it going, that's great.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.122
Okay, see, I'm not the only one
who thinks this is disgusting.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.915
She has morning
sickness, you idiot.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.125
Okay,

03:28.167 --> 03:30.293
well, this-this
can't be helping.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.546
The morning sickness
just started today.

03:32.587 --> 03:33.797
Well, shouldn't it
be ending soon?

03:33.839 --> 03:34.882
It's about to be noon.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.008
I actually read that, uh,

03:36.050 --> 03:37.009
it doesn't always
confine itself

03:37.051 --> 03:37.968
to the mornings.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.761
Awesome.
I know.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.971
It sucks, I'm sorry.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.723
But, hey, I'm gonna
be here for you.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.807
Whatever you need.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.350
I can't believe

03:45.392 --> 03:46.810
it's actually happening!

03:46.852 --> 03:48.228
I mean, we have a due date.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.731
In eight months,

03:50.772 --> 03:52.315
I'm gonna be a mom.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.068
WOMAN:
A healthy baby boy, slick

03:54.109 --> 03:56.070
with Savannah's nurturing
birth fluid.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.946
Oh, okay, eight months. (laughs)

03:57.988 --> 03:59.573
Wow, well, um... (clears throat)

03:59.614 --> 04:01.116
I got to go...

04:01.158 --> 04:03.660
somewhere where
this isn't happening.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.380
Hey, what's up?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.091
Isn't this a little weird now?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.634
Living in the back
of some guy's restaurant?

04:19.676 --> 04:20.719
No, I kind of like it.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.470
It's cozy.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.764
Oh, plus Mark and
I made a deal.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.640
I sign for all the shipments
when he's not around

04:25.682 --> 04:26.975
and, uh, in exchange,

04:27.017 --> 04:28.518
I get all the free tacos
I can eat.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.687
Ah, but what he doesn't know
is that, uh,

04:30.729 --> 04:32.439
I can eat a lot of tacos.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.733
So, listen.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.526
I heard Campbell saying

04:36.568 --> 04:37.652
some pretty
messed up stuff

04:37.694 --> 04:39.696
the other day about how, uh,

04:39.738 --> 04:42.449
he and his friends have been
doing some big cheating thing,

04:42.490 --> 04:44.826
and... they're gonna pin
the whole thing on you.

04:44.868 --> 04:45.953
What?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.454
I guess those
Cronus jerks

04:47.495 --> 04:49.539
really think they can get
away with anything.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.541
But I mean, but come on,
making you the fall guy?

04:51.583 --> 04:52.960
You've never cheated
a day in your life.

04:53.001 --> 04:53.835
Who's gonna believe them?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.713
Yeah, yeah, that's

04:56.755 --> 04:58.548
the thing, Liam, um...

05:00.008 --> 05:01.551
I did cheat.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.344
What are you talking about?
Well, I had a reason,

05:03.386 --> 05:04.805
but...
Well, what's the reason?

05:04.846 --> 05:07.766
I mean, you're, like,
the smartest guy in school.
(sighs)

05:07.808 --> 05:10.852
I-I texted the Cronus guys the
answers to the physics final.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.020
It was the only way Simon agreed

05:12.062 --> 05:13.147
not to press charges
against you.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.315
What?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.030
N-Navid, you-you could
take the fall

05:22.072 --> 05:23.865
for this as the ringleader.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.366
I wish you would've told me.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.786
It was my choice, but besides
you have nothing to worry about.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.537
I'm gonna go talk
to the dean right now.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.914
I'm gonna tell him exactly

05:30.956 --> 05:31.999
who's orchestrating
the cheating.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.125
What do you think
he's gonna say?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.961
I-I think he'll appreciate
the honesty.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.921
Hey, believe me--

05:37.963 --> 05:39.589
everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

05:39.631 --> 05:41.967
I'm gonna beat Campbell
to the punch.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.850
Yo, Annie, there's
something wrong

05:49.891 --> 05:51.101
with the doorknob
in your bathroom.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.644
Shh, I know.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.480
I-I don't want Mark
or Liam trying to fix it.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.606
Uh, why not?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.192
I thought they were good
at that kind of thing.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.068
Well, they both have
minor strengths

06:00.110 --> 06:02.196
as well as delusions
of grandeur.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.864
It's a bad combination, so I'm
gonna call a repairmen.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.073
Shh.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.201
(laughs)

06:07.242 --> 06:10.245
Hey, what brings you
over here so early?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.247
Honestly, man, I just had
to get out of the house.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.916
Between Silver and
Michaela, man, I feel

06:14.958 --> 06:16.335
like the whole
house is pregnant.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.461
You need a little estrogen
break-- I get it.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.587
These girls, they're great,

06:19.629 --> 06:21.464
but they can be
a little overwhelming.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.966
Tell me about it, man.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.636
And you had that whole Annie,
Naomi sister thing going on.

06:26.678 --> 06:27.762
Exactly.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.056
You and I have that
in common, I guess.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.099
At least the Annie part.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.018
Does that kind
of make us related?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.062
Yeah, yeah, I guess it does.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.771
I mean, so-so what are we?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.899
Like, uh, brothers twice
removed or something?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.192
We're in a brotherly zone.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.109
Yeah.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.195
Let's call it faux bros.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.947
Faux bros-- I like that.
(laughs)

06:45.989 --> 06:48.033
So what do you say we make this
faux bro-hood official, huh?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.826
Let's go out tonight,
let's get some drinks.

06:49.868 --> 06:50.869
Meet some girls.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.120
You mean ones who aren't

06:52.162 --> 06:53.496
our sisters or their friends

06:53.538 --> 06:55.040
or their friend's
pregnant surrogates?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.624
Yeah.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.210
I'm liking the sound of this.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.712
(laughs) Yes.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.172
MAN: I'm glad you
called me back, Naomi.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.757
I started my media company
two years ago,

07:03.798 --> 07:06.927
and we are finally starting
to get some real traction.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.845
And we're looking
to throw some events.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.764
Uh, launches, premieres,
that kind of thing.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.640
Well, Jordan, I can
assure you those type

07:12.682 --> 07:14.475
of high-end corporate events are
right up my alley.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.895
I can give you some
references if you like.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.230
Well, I don't need
any references,

07:18.272 --> 07:20.899
I just want to make sure
our parties are cool.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.901
You know, not all stodgy
and establishment.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.778
That's why I
came to you.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.947
You know, we're both getting
started the same time.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.949
You're young, you're fun.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.075
Single, huh?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.201
Not to make this

07:31.243 --> 07:32.369
all about your personal life,

07:32.411 --> 07:34.746
but who we are affects
how we work.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.872
Don't you think?

07:35.914 --> 07:38.875
Yeah, of course.
Okay.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.585
So take a look at some of our
projects and if you think

07:40.627 --> 07:42.796
it'll be a good fit,
please give me a call.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.756
Oh, I'm sure
it's a perfect fit,

07:44.798 --> 07:46.049
but I will certainly
look over this

07:46.091 --> 07:48.218
and get back to you with
some of my super cool ideas

07:48.260 --> 07:49.719
that come so naturally to me.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.763
Thank you for coming.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.722
All right.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.932
All right.
Thank you.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.809
(laughs) Bye.
Bye.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.812
Hey.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.230
You okay?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.067
No.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.902
I don't think I am.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.946
(both sighing)

08:11.699 --> 08:13.952
I'm not young and fun
and single.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.121
I'm divorced.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.999
I'm a sad old divorcée.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.084
Stop, okay?
Can I make you some tea?

08:21.126 --> 08:24.212
I think Ivy left it behind--
it's nice, it's calming.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.631
No, no tea.
I don't, I don't need that.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.384
I'm not some pathetic
hippy-dippy failure.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.594
I just told you
that I drank some.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.096
If I'm gonna be able to plan

08:33.138 --> 08:36.433
the kind of party
that Jordan wants,

08:36.475 --> 08:39.102
I'm gonna have to snap
out of this.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.188
So I'm going to go out.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.063
I'm gonna do shots.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.150
I'm gonna get crazy
and you're gonna do it with me.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
Naomi, are you sure
this is what you need?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.903
No, I've never needed anything
more in my life.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.989
You have to call Annie and
Silver, tell them to meet us.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.700
Because tonight
the real Naomi is back.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.061
All right, thank you.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.354
Well, what a coincidence.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.147
What did you just tell the dean?

09:24.189 --> 09:26.358
Nothing much-- I just

09:26.400 --> 09:28.902
heard about this big cheating
scandal and I wanted

09:28.943 --> 09:30.904
to make sure he knew Cronus
had nothing to do with it.

09:30.945 --> 09:31.988
What-what are you talking about?

09:32.030 --> 09:33.114
You organized the whole thing.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.491
You were texting out answers
like crazy.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.867
Okay, if that were true,
why would I have

09:35.909 --> 09:37.618
just given the dean all
of our phone records?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.703
He's already got proof

09:38.745 --> 09:41.748
that nobody
in Cronus was involved.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.832
You covered it up.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.252
What, you used dummy phones?

09:45.293 --> 09:47.295
Wow, you should write
spy novels, Shirazi,

09:47.337 --> 09:49.214
with all these crazy stories
you're spinning.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.840
All I know is

09:50.882 --> 09:52.467
my dad is on the board
of trustees

09:52.509 --> 09:54.302
and has a whole building
named after him.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.137
So you really think
the dean is gonna believe

09:56.179 --> 09:57.389
your story over mine?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.184
Anyway, I got
to get going.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.977
I got a big Cronus
party tonight.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.229
I would invite you, but

10:04.271 --> 10:07.190
you didn't want to be part
of Cronus, remember?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.442
Which is too bad because

10:08.483 --> 10:10.026
we really would've
had your back.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.250
So it's cool for you
to take a night off?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.294
One of the benefits
of running the place.
Mm, yeah.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.463
That and the free drinks.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.214
So, after we finish this,
you want to head out?

10:31.256 --> 10:34.468
Or we could stick around here
for a bit longer.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.722
Oh-ho.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.182
That's my faux bro.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.850
Getting it started early.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.770
Okay, let's go.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.230
(clears throat)

10:47.272 --> 10:48.356
Excuse me, ladies, uh...

10:48.398 --> 10:50.024
Good evening.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.277
Do you guys like, um...

10:52.319 --> 10:55.196
uh... origami?

10:55.238 --> 10:57.198
I'm not opposed to it.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.451
Origami? Come on, man.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.952
Oh, hey,
you're a Nirvana fan?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.954
Who's Nirvana?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.331
Are-are you serious?

11:04.372 --> 11:05.957
DIXON: You know, I was
supposed to make you a boat,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.750
but I changed my
mind late in the game,

11:07.792 --> 11:11.171
and I decided to make
you a mini coaster.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.755
(laughing)

11:12.797 --> 11:14.966
I'm clearly in the presence
of a master.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.843
And this master
will buy you a drink.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.557
I'm all for
supporting Naomi,

11:22.599 --> 11:23.933
but it makes me
really nervous,

11:23.975 --> 11:25.185
leaving Michaela at home
after she's been so sick.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.060
I'm sure
she'll be fine.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.357
Well, looks like people
are rediscovering Nirvana.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.483
Yeah, the smart ones are.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.194
You two look nice.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.487
Thank you.
(giggles)

11:35.529 --> 11:37.238
But we are on
a girls' night,

11:37.280 --> 11:39.073
so, we are going to
go meet up with the girls.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.200
Yep.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.742
(clears throat)

11:41.784 --> 11:43.286
Oh my God,
he is so cute.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.371
(sighs)

11:44.412 --> 11:45.497
We have to stay strong.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.290
You know.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.084
And remember our pact not to
get involved with him.
Yes.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.961
No guy is cute enough to come
in between our friendship.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.171
Again.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.172
Absolutely.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.049
(giggles)

12:04.891 --> 12:07.101
Hey, is something
bothering you?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.437
Besides the sex splinters?
(laughing)

12:09.479 --> 12:12.023
Yeah.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.775
Actually, when I was sneaking
out of your house the other day,

12:14.817 --> 12:15.985
I almost ran
into your stepson.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.571
Oh, crap, did he see you?

12:17.612 --> 12:20.198
No, but I did hear him
talking on the phone

12:20.240 --> 12:21.366
about how he
and his all friends

12:21.408 --> 12:22.992
have been cheating
on their finals.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.327
Really?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.163
That sounds like it could
get them in some major trouble.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.791
Yeah, except he's planning on
framing my friend for it.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.421
(sighs):
I-I just feel like
I should say something,

12:34.462 --> 12:36.130
you, know, help Navid out.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.215
No, you can't do that.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.175
If Campbell
finds out you overheard him,

12:39.217 --> 12:41.135
then he would know
that you were in the house.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.054
What if he told my husband?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.890
Then maybe it would help you get
that divorce you wanted.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.350
No, it's not that simple.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.768
My husband is
incredibly jealous.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.312
If he finds
out about us,

12:51.354 --> 12:53.147
I don't know what
he might do.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.066
And, besides, it's your word
against Campbell's.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.150
Well, I feel like a jerk

12:56.192 --> 12:58.111
letting my friend
take the fall for this.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.362
Then don't.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.030
Maybe you can't
tell what you heard,

13:01.072 --> 13:03.575
but you can't let Campbell
get away with this.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.951
You have to figure
out some other way

13:04.992 --> 13:07.203
to prove that
Campbell was cheating.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.213
NAOMI:
I cannot believe

13:17.255 --> 13:18.298
you brought that
homeopathic tea with you.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.507
It's so stupid.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.883
It's kind of addictive.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.469
And I'm the designated driver.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.095
I would not complain
if I were you.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.055
Whatever, as long as you
don't let it hold you back.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.474
Tonight is
very special.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.143
It's all about us getting
back to the way we used to be.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.270
So, no talking
about babies.
Who, me?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.063
Or how hard it is

13:34.105 --> 13:35.565
to live with your ex-boyfriend
who is incredibly hot.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.024
(scoffs)

13:37.066 --> 13:38.901
Or divorce.
(sighs)

13:38.943 --> 13:40.069
Are you sure you don't

13:40.111 --> 13:41.488
want to talk about
the divorce at all?

13:41.529 --> 13:42.739
I don't want
to talk about it.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.282
I don't want to
think about it.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.867
Instead,
I propose a toast.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.288
To dropping our
hideous baggage

13:50.330 --> 13:51.498
and returning to our

13:51.539 --> 13:53.082
young, fun, single selves.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.208
Cheers.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.003
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.723
(moaning)

14:10.975 --> 14:12.310
(yawning)

14:19.108 --> 14:21.194
Ade?

14:21.235 --> 14:22.529
(whining)

14:27.992 --> 14:29.327
Ade?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.120
Ade.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.913
Ade, wake up, wake up.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.332
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.292
Huh? Where...?

14:36.334 --> 14:37.418
What happened?

14:37.460 --> 14:38.628
I don't know.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.296
Why are you wearing a veil?

14:40.338 --> 14:42.256
What? What veil?

14:42.298 --> 14:43.132
What, what, no, no...

14:43.174 --> 14:45.552
No. No.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.011
No.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.722
Oh, my God, no.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.932
What the hell
happened last night?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.191
Annie, please call me
as soon as you get this.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.485
I have a very big problem.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.986
(screaming)
What?

15:04.028 --> 15:05.530
Did you find the rando guy
I married?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.323
No, I just saw my hair.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.116
Who would
do this to me?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.993
And why
would I have let them?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.120
The whole
night is a blur.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.205
But you weren't even drinking.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.082
I know, I guess that
tea I was sipping on

15:16.123 --> 15:17.792
was a little bit
more than calming.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.294
I wonder if I can get an
appointment with my colorist.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.088
No, no, Ade, listen, you can
deal with your skunk hair later.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.297
I have an emergency.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.717
If I got married, I have
to get it annulled, like, now.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.469
Otherwise, I have to
get divorced, again.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.596
I mean, it's bad enough
being defined as a divorcée,

15:29.637 --> 15:31.556
but a two-time divorcée,
I can't handle that.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.183
Okay, well, we'll find out
if you actually got married.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.393
And if so, to who.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.270
Okay, well, I already checked my
phone and Facebook

15:37.311 --> 15:38.646
and there are no leads at all,

15:38.688 --> 15:40.481
so, please tell me you remember
something, anything.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.150
Okay... uh,

15:43.192 --> 15:44.569
we were at the Offshore,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.237
you guys took some shots...

15:46.279 --> 15:47.447
Yeah.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.115
We went to a male strip club.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.241
Oh, fantastic.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.576
Which one?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.369
Uh, it had a name
like Buttocks, or...

15:53.411 --> 15:56.122
No... Thighs?

15:56.163 --> 15:57.248
Ham Hocks. Ham Hocks?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.793
Haunches!
Yes, yes, Haunches, Haunches.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.795
All right,
round up Annie and Silver.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.337
Have them meet us
there, okay, let's go.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.215
Adrianna, emergency.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.383
Okay.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.302
Okay.
(whimpering)

16:18.102 --> 16:19.604
Good morning.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.273
(sighs):
Good morning.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.483
(sighs)

16:23.524 --> 16:26.110
I had a really
good time last night.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.614
Yeah, me, too.

16:29.656 --> 16:34.410
And thanks for being
so cool about us not hooking up.

16:34.452 --> 16:38.790
I just, I have this rule
about not sleeping with guys

16:38.832 --> 16:40.207
the same night
that I meet them.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.292
I get it.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.210
You would much rather
know someone first.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.253
Exactly.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.172
Mm-hmm.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.382
But since, technically,

16:48.424 --> 16:50.760
it's not the same night
that we met anymore...

16:50.802 --> 16:52.052
Mmm.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.726
Man, I love a
good technicality.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.231
(gagging and choking)

17:04.272 --> 17:06.693
Is someone throwing up
in your living room?

17:08.152 --> 17:09.695
(sighs) Yep.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.615
Stay right there.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.074
Don't-don't move.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.034
Hey, buddy.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.079
Look, I'm actually
not alone right now.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.498
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.582
I'm so sorry.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.250
No, it's-it's cool

17:23.291 --> 17:24.417
God, morning sickness sucks.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.627
(sniffling)

17:25.670 --> 17:27.128
I'm either nauseous

17:27.171 --> 17:28.339
or I'm craving foods
I thought I hated.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.550
Wait, morning sickness?

17:30.591 --> 17:34.261
She's pregnant?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.722
Uh, yeah, yeah she is.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.265
But-but it's-it's,
it's not mine.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.767
It's-it's
not even hers.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.811
I don't even
know her that well.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.897
It's a long,
complicated, boring story.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.272
We shouldn't even talk about it.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.774
Maybe we should
go get some breakfast.
No way.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.359
But, it's not my baby.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.194
No, I mean, I'm not going
to leave her here like this.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.822
My sister
just had a baby,

17:52.864 --> 17:54.281
and she had
really bad morning sickness

17:54.323 --> 17:55.241
for, like, two months.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.409
She basically
lived on crackers.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.953
Crackers sound really
gross right now.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.664
It's fine,
really, I'm okay.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.165
Please don't change
your plans because of me.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.125
I'm just going to
sit here with my bucket.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.210
See, she's fine.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.253
Maybe we should just...

18:07.294 --> 18:08.254
Oh, no. No, no, no,

18:08.295 --> 18:09.589
you're not getting
rid of me that easily.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.799
Dixon, we're going to need
a cool, damp washcloth

18:11.841 --> 18:13.676
and a box
of saltines.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.344
I don't think we have any.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.430
Then you're going to
have to run out and get some.

18:17.471 --> 18:21.475
Then I'm going to have
to run out and get some.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.573
Holy mackerel.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.783
You back already?

18:36.824 --> 18:39.535
You remember me?

18:39.577 --> 18:40.578
How could I forget you?

18:40.620 --> 18:41.746
I had to forcibly
remove you

18:41.788 --> 18:42.956
from the stage,
like, three times.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.959
Sorry about that.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.836
So, listen, did
you happen to see me

18:48.878 --> 18:50.212
leave here with
anyone last night?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.589
Leave?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.882
I thought
you'd never leave.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.968
I mean, you were
all over the dancers

18:55.009 --> 18:56.677
and said you were
tired of going home alone.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.722
But no,
I didn't see you leave.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.809
Oh, my God,

19:02.850 --> 19:04.602
I might have
married one of those?

19:04.644 --> 19:08.773
BARTENDER:
Funny, you didn't strike
me as the marrying kind.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.317
I wouldn't think so,
either, but apparently I am.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.735
I need every
single one of these

19:12.777 --> 19:14.904
beefcakes' phone
numbers, pronto.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.619
Oh, my God.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.416
Listen, man, uh,

19:27.458 --> 19:29.627
I-I think I am going
to need your help after all.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.337
You know that thing
you heard Campbell say?

19:31.378 --> 19:34.298
Turns out it's, uh,
the only evidence I got.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.759
(sighs):
Yeah, man, I'm-I'm
really sorry

19:36.801 --> 19:38.719
but I-I can't tell
anyone about that.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.346
Why not?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.056
Because of how
I overheard him.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.809
I was in his house,
with his stepmom.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.769
Sydney.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.688
Wait, our-our investor...

19:48.729 --> 19:51.024
uh, who you're
having an affair with,

19:51.065 --> 19:53.442
is-is also
Campbell's stepmom?

19:53.484 --> 19:54.777
Yeah.

19:54.819 --> 19:57.030
You're literally
sleeping with the enemy.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.239
Whoa, hey, she's not
the enemy; Campbell is.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.534
She thinks we should
find some other evidence

20:01.575 --> 20:02.785
to show that he's guilty.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.912
Okay, wow, uh, well,
I guess it's possible

20:04.954 --> 20:06.622
that one of the
Cronus guys still has

20:06.664 --> 20:07.874
one of the
dummy cell phones

20:07.915 --> 20:08.916
they used for the cheating.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.459
That's what
we'll look for.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.961
But how?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.504
Those guys won't even
let me near them.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.964
(sighs)

20:15.006 --> 20:17.050
They might still be willing
to hang out with me.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.226
(rapid knocking)

20:29.353 --> 20:30.437
Hey.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.564
Oh, thank God you're here.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.440
Annie's not answering
her phone, which is weird,

20:33.482 --> 20:35.442
and Naomi needs us
at a strip club right away.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.777
I'm sorry, what?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.529
Yeah, she
thinks she got married

20:38.571 --> 20:39.530
and she doesn't remember.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.490
Your hair...
Mm, don't.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.993
Okay, um, I'm
going to get my stuff.

20:44.035 --> 20:47.371
So, I'm assuming you
don't know anything either?

20:48.831 --> 20:49.916
Hey, where did you go?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.542
You disappeared last night
after the Offshore.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.794
Yeah, no, I, um,
I checked on Michaela

20:53.836 --> 20:55.379
and she was
craving cheese puffs,

20:55.421 --> 20:57.048
so I ran out to
bring her some.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.674
When I came back you
guys were already gone.

20:58.716 --> 20:59.800
I called your cell phones.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.094
Nobody was picking up,

21:01.135 --> 21:02.720
so I just came home
and went to bed.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.347
Really? Alone?

21:05.389 --> 21:07.808
What, this is mine.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.852
I just rarely wear it,

21:09.894 --> 21:11.729
because it's so ugly.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.023
Silver, I woke up with
Bride of Frankenstein hair.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.315
At least let
me vicariously live

21:15.357 --> 21:16.400
through your hook up.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.027
Come on, tell
me who it is.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.486
Doesn't
Naomi need our help?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.739
Fine, don't tell me.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.866
Oh, is it that
beer delivery guy

21:23.908 --> 21:25.034
with the awesome arms?

21:28.788 --> 21:32.041
So, you're sure you and I
didn't get married last night?

21:32.083 --> 21:33.709
Um, yeah.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.169
I mean, you're
good looking and all,

21:35.211 --> 21:36.879
but why would I tie
myself down like that?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.505
You're so right.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.883
The world is your oyster,
here at Haunches.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.843
Oh, man, your
hair looks awesome.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.345
Mauricio nailed it.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.764
I always have him
do my frosted tips.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.974
Who's Mauricio?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.683
He's one of the dancers here.

21:49.725 --> 21:50.726
You don't remember him?

21:50.768 --> 21:52.519
You two went back
to your place together

21:52.561 --> 21:54.230
so he could do your hair.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.482
Wait, wait,
did I marry Mauricio?

21:56.523 --> 21:57.900
Oh, no, he's already married.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.819
His husband is the bomb.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.487
Makes a great guacamole.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.322
Great, so I didn't marry
any of the strippers.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.740
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.700
Wow, you guys really
went for it last night.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.994
Oh, and like you didn't,

22:08.035 --> 22:11.122
little miss hook up
with mysterious jacket guy.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.040
Yeah, whatever.
How about this?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.458
Flashing of the boobs.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.002
Nice shot. Nice
work, you guys.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.503
Can I see that for a second?

22:17.544 --> 22:19.130
These are not my boobs.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.007
Then whose are they?
Oh, that's those

22:21.048 --> 22:22.508
other two girls.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.343
You know, your friends,
the ones from TV.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.553
I don't have friends from TV.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.514
From that Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.640
You left here with them.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.725
What?
I can't believe
you don't remember.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.602
You were seriously bonding
with them.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.479
You kept calling yourselves
the three divorcées.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.814
Kind of like
the three amigos,

22:36.856 --> 22:38.983
I guess, but sadder.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.152
Adrianna,

22:41.194 --> 22:42.778
get me a list
of the housewives.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.863
We're gonna find
those bitches.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.959
Based on which
Beverly Hills housewives

22:57.001 --> 22:58.711
were actually in town
last night,

22:58.752 --> 23:00.378
and which ones
are also divorced,

23:00.420 --> 23:02.548
it has to be Brandi
and Camille.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.176
Their publicists said
they come here every day.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.844
Though I'm not quite sure
what this place is.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.470
It's Bolates.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.598
You get Botox and Pilates
all in one.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.391
Clearly the stripper blew
our so-called bonding

23:13.433 --> 23:14.434
out of proportion.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.728
I mean, if I left
with the housewives,

23:15.769 --> 23:16.896
I was probably
just helping them get home

23:16.937 --> 23:18.231
like a Girl Scout.

23:18.272 --> 23:19.065
Otherwise,
what do I possibly have

23:19.106 --> 23:20.398
in common with them?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.859
(women gasping)
Oh, my God.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.401
Our sister
from another mister.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.403
(women squealing happily)

23:37.958 --> 23:39.919
Court!

23:41.712 --> 23:43.214
I didn't know you were
still interested Cronus.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.882
You kind of dropped off the face
of the earth.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.217
I've been busy

23:46.259 --> 23:47.385
with some stuff lately,
but yeah,

23:47.425 --> 23:48.677
I'm definitely interested.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.679
Even though your buddy, Shirazi,
told us to suck it?

23:50.721 --> 23:52.806
Man, that guy's an idiot.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.016
I don't care what he thinks.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.102
Oh, so you're like,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.771
not friends
with Shirazi anymore?

23:58.812 --> 24:00.814
Never really was.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.024
Well, in that case,

24:02.066 --> 24:03.650
have a seat.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.611
You have great timing.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.030
Tonight is initiation night

24:08.072 --> 24:09.156
for Cronus.
What's up?

24:09.198 --> 24:10.616
All right.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.660
Yo, yo.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.079
Hey.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.789
I basically bought the store
out of saltines.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.582
So I hope they do the trick.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.251
Where's Helen?

24:20.293 --> 24:22.669
Oh, I sent her out to get me
some soup I was craving.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.588
Why didn't you text me?
I could've got it.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.923
No, you couldn't have.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.049
It's this special soup,

24:27.091 --> 24:28.675
Peruvian soup,
made from llama's milk.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.928
You can only get it at
this one place in Simi Valley

24:30.970 --> 24:31.845
that I completely

24:31.887 --> 24:33.889
made up.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.766
Oh, okay, why?
I'm sorry, Dixon,

24:35.808 --> 24:37.517
I know you guys
were hitting it off,

24:37.559 --> 24:39.645
but if I had to listen
to one more story

24:39.686 --> 24:41.563
about her pregnant sister's
delicate esophagus,

24:41.605 --> 24:43.065
I was gonna punch her
in the face.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.233
Ew.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.525
Nobody seems to believe this,

24:45.567 --> 24:46.652
but I don't actually

24:46.693 --> 24:48.528
want to think
about pregnancy 24-7.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.989
You don't?

24:50.030 --> 24:52.699
No. Especially when it's not
even my own baby.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.201
I mean, like,
don't get me wrong,

24:54.243 --> 24:56.120
I'm totally happy
to be doing this,

24:56.162 --> 24:58.998
but it's taking over
my entire life.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.666
Taking over?

25:00.707 --> 25:02.960
It's taking over
my entire life.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.130
I really am sorry.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.298
It's not your fault.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.092
But really? The birthing videos?

25:10.134 --> 25:12.303
Oh, freaking disgusting.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.512
I know, right?
Look, I... I get it.

25:14.554 --> 25:15.973
Babies are supposed
to be beautiful,

25:16.015 --> 25:17.266
and the whole nine yards,

25:17.308 --> 25:18.934
but seeing a baby come out...

25:18.976 --> 25:21.854
It's-it's like that scene
in Alien.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.023
(laughs):
Exactly.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.108
Oh, I love Alien.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.734
Me, too.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.569
You want to watch it?

25:29.611 --> 25:30.821
I got it on Blu-ray.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.031
Hell yeah.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.866
But you know
what I want to do first?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.326
Throw up?

25:35.368 --> 25:38.120
No, get a giant plate of nachos.

25:38.162 --> 25:39.121
I'm in a craving phase.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.248
You're a genius.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.210
Let's go.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.045
BRANDI:
So what happened was

25:46.086 --> 25:47.671
we were watching a movie
on my phone.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.006
And one of the strippers
kept bragging

25:49.048 --> 25:49.923
about this porno he was in.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.300
Yeah.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.301
And we thought,
what the heck,

25:52.343 --> 25:54.094
let's check it out.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.680
And it was a complete
rip-off of my favorite movie.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.265
BOTH:
Corporate Invaders.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.142
I'm a huge Liam Court fan.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.935
Aren't we all?
And that's what I was saying

26:01.977 --> 26:02.978
to Cam, I was like,

26:03.020 --> 26:04.938
"Oh, my God, yeah,
the stripper's like,

26:04.980 --> 26:07.274
well-endowed and whatnot,
but Liam is so much hotter."

26:07.316 --> 26:08.734
And your friend,

26:08.775 --> 26:11.695
the little one, was like,
"I live with Liam."

26:11.737 --> 26:12.779
Party time.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.031
So we all jumped
into my Bentley

26:14.073 --> 26:15.741
and went to Liam's house.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.868
But he wasn't home,
so I was really sad.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.745
You were sad.
I was sad.

26:19.786 --> 26:20.913
So we decided to watch

26:20.954 --> 26:22.122
The First Wives Club.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.457
That always makes her
feel better.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.084
But it seemed like the movie
was getting you upset.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.960
You said that
you didn't want

26:27.002 --> 26:29.587
to be a divorcée because you
didn't want it to define you.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.923
Yeah, we told
you it won't...

26:30.964 --> 26:33.175
entirely.

26:33.217 --> 26:36.345
I mean, it definitely changes
the way people see you.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.389
Because you're not
yourself anymore,

26:38.431 --> 26:39.597
and your not somebody's wife.

26:39.639 --> 26:40.891
You're somebody's ex-wife.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.935
(laughs):
Exactly.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.938
Well, thank you

26:45.979 --> 26:48.857
for all
of this incredible support,

26:48.899 --> 26:50.192
but we actually
want to know

26:50.234 --> 26:52.152
if at some point last night

26:52.194 --> 26:54.405
I, um, married someone?

26:54.447 --> 26:55.989
I have no idea.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.032
I went to the bathroom,

26:57.074 --> 26:59.910
and when I came out again,
you were gone.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.828
She was in the one bathroom,
and that little, tiny girl

27:01.870 --> 27:03.663
was in the other bathroom,
and I had to go so bad,

27:03.705 --> 27:04.998
I just couldn't hold it
any longer,

27:05.040 --> 27:06.333
so I popped a squat
in the backyard.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.127
Oh, my God.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.462
No, don't worry.
No one saw me.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.130
I know why Annie's
not returning our calls.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.756
I think she's trapped.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.136
Thank you both. We have to go.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.929
What a hot mess
those three are.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.806
Yeah.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.937
What about
the other new members?

27:26.979 --> 27:29.482
Don't they have
to be initiated, too?

27:29.523 --> 27:32.276
They did this weeks ago,
when you'd gone AWOL.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.362
Well, it looks like I have
some catching up to do.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.490
Whoa, easy.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.994
Dude, slow down.
Wow.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.791
Not bad.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.293
Well, I do own a bar.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.086
So if this is
one big drinking contest...

27:51.128 --> 27:53.088
So you're not feeling
challenged enough.

27:53.130 --> 27:57.009
Well, you will be happy to know
that this is just part one.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.885
What's part two?

27:58.927 --> 28:00.429
Nothing much.

28:00.471 --> 28:03.307
Just a refreshing
little stroll...

28:03.349 --> 28:06.560
up here.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.151
Annie?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.902
Oh, my God,
we're terrible friends.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.321
She could be dead in there.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.114
SILVER:
At least she has water.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.241
(grunting)

28:23.452 --> 28:25.329
Seriously?

28:25.371 --> 28:29.583
It took you guys 18 hours
to realize I was missing?

28:33.170 --> 28:35.130
(scoffs)

28:39.593 --> 28:41.387
Ugh. I really hope that is
the closest I ever get

28:41.428 --> 28:43.138
to 127 Hours.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.098
Stupid doorknob.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.560
Why didn't I just let Liam
and Mark fix it?

28:47.601 --> 28:49.436
Or if you were stuck
in there all night,

28:49.478 --> 28:50.854
why didn't you just yell?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.981
I tried, but my voice was
a little bit shot

28:53.023 --> 28:54.983
from yelling all night
at strippers

28:55.025 --> 28:56.818
to show me the goods.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.111
I got a little carried away.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.280
We all did.
Eventually,
it got quiet,

29:00.322 --> 29:01.532
so I thought you guys had left,

29:01.574 --> 29:03.409
and Liam and Mark
never came home last night.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.494
So basically,
you have no idea where I went.

29:05.536 --> 29:08.080
I assumed you went home
to put on sweatpants and cry.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.083
You seemed pretty shaken up
by that ridiculous movie.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.085
So, breaking you out
of the bathroom was
completely pointless.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.962
All right, I'll just go
back in there, but this time,

29:16.004 --> 29:17.964
I'm definitely taking my phone.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.508
Annie, I'm sorry,
I just... I'm never gonna find

29:19.550 --> 29:21.343
that idiot that I married,
and I'm gonna spend

29:21.385 --> 29:22.469
the rest of my life
as a pathetic,

29:22.511 --> 29:24.221
bitter double-divorcée.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.181
I might as well give up now.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.391
I wish I could help you.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.310
And maybe I can,

29:30.352 --> 29:32.229
because at 4:17 a.m.,

29:32.271 --> 29:33.439
I got an e-nnouncement

29:33.480 --> 29:36.191
from Lala's All-Night
Wedding Chapel.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.193
Let me see that!

29:42.030 --> 29:43.865
You married
your brother?

29:57.463 --> 29:59.881
(chuckles)
Wow.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.819
(laughs)

30:38.086 --> 30:39.296
Are you happy now?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.089
Me? I'm great,

30:41.131 --> 30:44.050
but you're still not getting
into Cronus.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.552
What the hell, man?

30:45.594 --> 30:47.179
I just put my life
on the line.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.348
And you did a decent job,

30:49.389 --> 30:50.849
but you walking on some ledge,

30:50.890 --> 30:52.225
while extremely entertaining,

30:52.267 --> 30:55.771
doesn't prove that you're
not friends with Shirazi.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.147
Look, man,
I haven't been friends

30:57.189 --> 30:59.399
with Navid since he leaked
a sex tape of mine

30:59.441 --> 31:00.442
and he ruined a relationship.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.069
He's a dick.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.113
So I don't know
what your plans with him are,

31:05.155 --> 31:06.406
but personally,

31:06.448 --> 31:09.159
I would be thrilled to see him
get what he deserves.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.452
What do I have to do

31:10.494 --> 31:12.454
to make you believe me?

31:12.496 --> 31:15.624
Give me your phone.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.593
Mmm.
Mmm.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.970
These nachos
are beautifully balanced.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.305
Right?
Mm-hmm.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.682
With the layering
and everything.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.142
Mm-hmm.
I'm telling you,
my faux bro knows how to do it.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.435
(laughs)

31:35.477 --> 31:37.312
I'm actually about
to get something to drink.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.605
You want something?
Ginger ale,
please and thank you.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.440
Gotcha.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.152
Hey, uh, two
ginger ales.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.363
Hey, man. I didn't
even notice

31:46.405 --> 31:48.699
you were here.
Hey, what's going on?

31:48.741 --> 31:50.409
Not much, uh, getting
some nachos with Michaela,

31:50.450 --> 31:52.369
then going back to the
house and watching Alien.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.120
Sounds like
a pretty good date.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.039
What? No. No, no, no, no. No.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.666
This is...
this is not a date, dude.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.877
We're just hanging out.
She's just a really cool girl.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.503
So dinner and a movie
with a really cool girl

32:01.545 --> 32:02.504
is not a date?

32:02.546 --> 32:04.548
(sighs)
Look, man,

32:04.590 --> 32:05.841
you don't have to worry
about anything.

32:05.883 --> 32:07.050
Michaela and I were
a one-time thing.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.051
I'm happy for you, man.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.345
(phone chimes)
Oh, it's Liam.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.513
Looks like he came through.

32:11.555 --> 32:12.556
I got to go.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.224
Okay.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.308
Here you are.

32:15.350 --> 32:18.270
Thanks, man.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.229
Hey.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.189
Thanks.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.987
What, are there no free refills?

32:28.029 --> 32:29.030
(chuckles)

32:30.240 --> 32:31.575
Uh, no.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.035
No, seriously, what?

32:34.077 --> 32:35.995
Nothing.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.122
Nothing. (chuckles)

32:37.163 --> 32:39.124
Nothing. Nachos.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.959
Yes!

32:47.758 --> 32:49.551
(humming
"Bridal Chorus")

32:49.593 --> 32:51.720
(chuckles)

32:51.762 --> 32:54.264
Okay,
obviously I didn't marry you,

32:54.306 --> 32:56.516
so please tell me what the hell
happened last night.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.059
I'm not surprised
you don't remember.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.019
You were fairly obliterated
when you called.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.855
I called you?
From a convenience store.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.691
You were crying into a
pint of butter pecan,

33:04.733 --> 33:06.318
so I drove over,
and we talked,

33:06.359 --> 33:08.361
and then you got married
to yourself.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.364
I married myself?

33:13.617 --> 33:14.827
Well, I guess it makes
a sad kind of sense.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.745
I must have realized
no one else would want

33:16.787 --> 33:18.580
to be with a failure like me.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.207
Like I told you last night,
you are blowing

33:21.249 --> 33:23.251
this whole divorcée thing
way out of proportion.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.211
Thank you, Mark, but you don't
know what it's like.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.173
I do. I felt the exact same way
after my divorce.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.634
Wait. You're divorced?
I didn't know that.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.470
It's not like we have to wear
a big red "D"

33:33.512 --> 33:34.680
on all our clothes.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.265
I know. Well, I feel like I am.

33:37.307 --> 33:41.186
I tried to go out last night,
be the old Naomi,

33:41.227 --> 33:42.604
young, carefree, fun.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.314
But instead,
I ended up

33:44.356 --> 33:46.692
drunk, bitter, watching
First Wives Club

33:46.733 --> 33:48.401
with a bunch of other divorcées.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.362
And I might as well tattoo
the big "D"

33:50.403 --> 33:52.113
right here on my forehead.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.032
First of all, you have been
divorced for,

33:54.073 --> 33:55.325
like, ten minutes,

33:55.367 --> 33:58.286
and you need to stop beating
the crap out of yourself.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.164
You are young and strong
and beautiful and smart.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.166
And you've got your whole
life ahead of you.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.586
Your divorce is just
a, a tiny piece of it.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.087
You really believe that?

34:08.129 --> 34:11.299
Yes. You just need to give it
some time.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.051
At least,
that's what worked for me.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.387
And as cheesy as it sounds,

34:15.428 --> 34:17.973
I had to learn to love myself
a little

34:18.014 --> 34:20.641
before I could even think about
getting back out there.

34:20.684 --> 34:23.311
But that should be easy for you.
You're pretty lovable.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.647
I suppose you told me
all this last night?

34:25.688 --> 34:26.940
I did.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.108
And then you spotted
the wedding chapel

34:29.150 --> 34:31.194
and had the great idea
to marry yourself.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.612
(groans)

34:32.654 --> 34:34.781
It wasn't out of self-pity.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.659
It was out of something
more like... hope.

34:37.701 --> 34:43.415
Thank you... for being there
for me last night.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.458
And right now.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.627
That's what brothers are for.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.463
(laughs softly)

34:57.136 --> 34:58.430
Hey, I got your text.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.098
Hey!

35:01.516 --> 35:03.142
What's going on?!

35:03.184 --> 35:05.062
You've been trying to prove
all night

35:05.103 --> 35:06.688
that you're not loyal
to Shirazi.

35:06.730 --> 35:07.856
Here's your chance.

35:09.399 --> 35:10.817
You want me to hit him?

35:10.859 --> 35:13.361
That is your strong
suit, isn't it?

35:13.403 --> 35:15.196
Plus he deserves it.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.494
(groans)

35:21.536 --> 35:23.329
Come on, Fight Club,

35:23.371 --> 35:24.957
you can do
a little better than that.

35:24.998 --> 35:27.709
Unless there's something
holding you back.

35:27.751 --> 35:31.463
Liam, please don't do this.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.424
Hey, I've known you since
high school. Come on, man.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.842
(scoffs)
Wow.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.768
(groans)

35:52.609 --> 35:54.486
I'm just glad
you're feeling better.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.696
Ugh! Talking to Mark last
night really helped.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.825
It's nice to have a brother
you can count on.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.535
And one who helped us
solve your mystery.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.121
Though we still haven't
identified

36:04.162 --> 36:05.246
Silver's mystery hook up.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.372
It's my jacket, Adrianna.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.125
How many times
do I have to tell you?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.375
M'kay.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.376
Mm-hmm.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.586
All right. I gotta run.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.506
I'm heading to
my hair appointment.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.008
In spite of all the fiascoes,

36:16.049 --> 36:17.843
we should do girls' night
more often.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.512
(chuckles)
See you.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.597
Oh. There's still one thing
I can't figure out.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.308
Mark said I called
him that night,
and the last call

36:25.350 --> 36:27.644
I had on my phone
history was you.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.687
Oh, that's weird.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.689
Yeah, and I probably
just deleted it.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.983
But I am going
to call Jordan back.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.777
I figure best way to start
getting over my divorce,

36:35.819 --> 36:37.654
secure a hot new client.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.738
(laughs)

36:38.780 --> 36:40.365
Hello, Jordan?

36:40.406 --> 36:41.700
Naomi Clark.

36:41.741 --> 36:45.162
Yeah, I was just calling because
I have a few ideas I think

36:45.203 --> 36:46.621
you're gonna go crazy for.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.214
(Silver clears throat)

36:59.467 --> 37:01.970
Hi.

37:02.012 --> 37:03.346
Thanks.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.973
I didn't think to grab it.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.475
When you left my place
to go meet Naomi?

37:07.517 --> 37:09.978
And here I've been thinking
that was just your M.O.:

37:10.020 --> 37:12.271
slipping away in the middle
of the night

37:12.313 --> 37:13.648
while your conquest lay
sleeping.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.316
I really didn't want to leave.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.235
Sorry I answered your phone,
by the way.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.778
It was 3:00 in the morning.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.321
I wasn't thinking.

37:20.363 --> 37:21.865
It's okay.
I don't think Naomi knows.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.492
If you don't want her to know,
I won't tell her.

37:24.534 --> 37:26.536
Thanks.

37:26.578 --> 37:30.456
But actually, there is someone
who I do have to tell.

37:32.625 --> 37:36.462
Ugh! I never thought living with
two guys would be

37:36.504 --> 37:38.631
the thing that forced me
to learn home repair skills.

37:38.673 --> 37:42.552
Anyway, how did your big night
out with Mark go?

37:42.594 --> 37:44.804
Did you meet
someone special?

37:44.846 --> 37:47.599
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.768
Really? That's awesome!

37:49.809 --> 37:51.519
Yeah, I guess it is.
It's, um...

37:51.561 --> 37:53.312
But it's complicated.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.984
Yeah.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.909
How's it feel?

38:05.951 --> 38:08.286
Not great.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.583
So I checked some of the Cronus
guys' phones last night.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.668
I couldn't find anything.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.796
(sighs)

38:21.091 --> 38:23.509
I really appreciate it, man.
All of it.

38:23.551 --> 38:27.222
Because if this doesn't
work, I'll be expelled.

38:27.264 --> 38:30.558
And my whole future
will be over.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.102
Hey, I'll find something.
I will.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.686
No, you have
to be careful, man.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.231
If the Cronus guys find out
you're lying to them,

38:36.273 --> 38:38.900
they'll do something way
worse to you than you did to me.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.911
Hey, Ade.
Hey.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.079
You know, it's weird,

38:51.121 --> 38:52.872
now that my hair's back
to normal, I kind of

38:52.914 --> 38:53.873
miss the skunk stripes.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.835
(both chuckle)

38:56.876 --> 39:00.130
Okay, look, I need
to talk to you

39:00.172 --> 39:01.339
about something that happened
the other night.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.551
When I went back
to the Offshore

39:05.593 --> 39:07.679
and you guys were already gone,

39:07.720 --> 39:12.851
I ended up talking to Mark
for, like,

39:12.892 --> 39:14.811
a really long time.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.690
And we just...
we really connected.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.944
And he ended up coming home
with me.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.696
And if that bothers you,

39:24.737 --> 39:26.447
then I will never
see him again.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.200
'Cause we made a pact
I broke the pact,

39:28.241 --> 39:30.451
and I'm really sorry. Ade.
I am. I'm really sorry,

39:30.493 --> 39:32.162
and I hope
that you can forgive me.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.082
It's fine.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.043
Really?

39:38.084 --> 39:42.088
Silver, you've forgiven me
for a whole lot worse.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.382
Besides, I think it was
actually really brave of you

39:44.423 --> 39:45.800
to tell the truth.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.220
So, we're good?

39:48.261 --> 39:50.889
Yeah. I mean,
why wouldn't we be?

39:50.930 --> 39:52.807
All right, awesome.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.017
(chuckles)

39:54.059 --> 39:55.685
Thank you.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.687
I like your hair like this.
