<i>There are places</i>
<i>in our souls so remote,</i>

00:20.455 --> 00:22.848
<i>no light can reach them.</i>

00:26.287 --> 00:29.507
<i>And the truths that inhabit thm</i>

00:29.551 --> 00:32.075
<i>grow accustomed to the darknes.</i>

00:35.557 --> 00:39.517
<i>They cannot fathom</i>
<i>ever escaping it,</i>

00:39.561 --> 00:42.607
<i>and they do not want</i>
<i>to be disturbed.</i>

01:20.167 --> 01:22.865
A woman and her son

01:22.908 --> 01:25.085
are walking down the beach

01:25.128 --> 01:27.261
when a huge wave

01:27.304 --> 01:29.437
crashes onto them,

01:29.480 --> 01:31.352
and when it clears,
the woman looks down,

01:31.395 --> 01:34.355
and her son is gone.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.229
She falls to her knees, and...

01:39.273 --> 01:41.144
and she looks up to the sky,
and she says,

01:41.188 --> 01:43.451
"Please, I'm-I'm begging you,

01:43.494 --> 01:46.410
"I-I-I can't live without him,
he's everything to me.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.760
"Whoever is up there,
whoever can hear me,

01:48.804 --> 01:51.241
please send my son
back to me alive."

01:52.808 --> 01:54.853
Just then, she looks up
at the horizon,

01:54.897 --> 01:57.552
and an albatross

01:57.552 --> 01:59.771
appears in the sky.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.165
It follows a ray of sunshine

02:02.209 --> 02:04.124
from the clouds onto the water,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.604
and it dives under the surface,

02:06.648 --> 02:08.302
and when it emerges,

02:08.345 --> 02:10.478
the boy is riding on its back.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.134
So, it flies to the beach,

02:14.177 --> 02:16.353
and it gently deposits

02:16.397 --> 02:18.225
the boy at its mother's feet.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.403
And the woman looks at the boy.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.622
And then she looks to the sky,

02:24.666 --> 02:27.190
and she says,

02:27.234 --> 02:29.366
"He had a hat."

02:33.892 --> 02:36.591
Seems a little soon
for dead kid jokes.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.158
Was that supposed to funny?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.334
Not "ha-ha" funny.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.205
Well, what was it
supposed to be?

02:42.249 --> 02:44.164
Well, we haven't spoken
since the door closed.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.645
We have no idea
where we're going.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.038
We have no idea
when we'll get there,

02:49.081 --> 02:51.693
or what we'll find when we do,

02:51.736 --> 02:53.782
so I guess maybe I just thought
I'd start preparing us

02:53.825 --> 02:55.740
for what happens
when the door opens.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.265
Well, I guess if Shecky Greene
is there on the tarmac

02:58.265 --> 03:00.310
when we land,
now we'll have an opener.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.970
What am I to you?

03:09.624 --> 03:11.234
Excuse me?

03:15.456 --> 03:17.719
What.... am I...

03:17.762 --> 03:19.416
to you?

03:22.114 --> 03:25.596
We're just gonna
do this right now, huh?

03:25.640 --> 03:28.077
Well, I guess it depends.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.861
Up until today, I would've
said you were someone

03:29.861 --> 03:31.428
I considered to be a part
of my family.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.300
What changed?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.257
You want me to say it out loud

03:34.301 --> 03:35.780
or would you like to do it?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.089
Hello, Emily.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.271
How in God's name
did this happen?

03:48.315 --> 03:49.664
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.841
There are safeguards
on top of safeguards to prevent

03:52.884 --> 03:56.061
exactly this kind of thing
from happening.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.281
- I don't know, exactly.
- You don't know.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.852
My father asked me what I wanted
to do with my life.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.637
It was 2002,

04:06.681 --> 04:10.250
and I told him I wanted
to protect my country.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.818
He said he knew someone

04:13.818 --> 04:15.951
who could help.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.127
Some guy who was a mentor to him

04:18.170 --> 04:20.651
back at the Agency who could
pull some strings, he said.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.439
Once I was in, I...

04:25.482 --> 04:27.267
never asked again.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.486
That's just not how we work.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.489
It was done.
I just put my head down,

04:32.533 --> 04:34.535
- and I did the work.
- You did the work.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.929
Is that supposed to make
a difference, Angela...

04:37.973 --> 04:40.149
Jesus, I don't even know
what to call you.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.543
You think I'm someone different
now than I was five minutes ago?

04:42.586 --> 04:44.849
I think you've been
someone different

04:44.893 --> 04:46.938
as long as I have known you.
I think you've been lying to me

04:46.982 --> 04:48.375
- for as long as I've known you.
- I have been

04:48.375 --> 04:52.030
nothing since I've known you
but loyal to you.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.119
And devoted to you.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.905
And fucking determined
to make you

04:56.948 --> 04:58.341
proud of me.

04:59.603 --> 05:03.346
I am still the same person.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.739
I'm maybe more that person now

05:04.739 --> 05:06.958
than anyone else I've ever been.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.441
I'm sorry I lost my hat.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.188
I must have taught you
more than I thought.

05:19.231 --> 05:22.017
When faced with the reality
that you are guilty

05:22.060 --> 05:24.019
of more crimes than I can count,

05:24.062 --> 05:26.717
that you represent
maybe the most serious

05:26.761 --> 05:29.807
security breach the FBI
has seen in recent memory,

05:29.851 --> 05:31.722
you throw the first punch

05:31.766 --> 05:34.595
and make me out
to be the villain?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.945
My honest-to-God

05:36.988 --> 05:40.644
Do you really think
this was gonna work?

05:40.688 --> 05:43.734
I suppose that,
for as long we're in the air,

05:43.778 --> 05:45.345
you can claim to be
two different people,

05:45.388 --> 05:47.738
and pretend that it's tenable,

05:47.782 --> 05:50.480
but as soon as this plane lands,

05:50.524 --> 05:51.394
you're going to
have to make a choice

05:51.438 --> 05:54.876
about which one of you emerges.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.922
And then I'm going to have to
decide what to do about it.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.545
There are places in our hearts

06:11.588 --> 06:13.416
so inhospitable,

06:13.460 --> 06:15.505
no sounds can penetrate them.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.770
Hard and secret places

06:19.814 --> 06:22.251
in which unspeakable things
are stored.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.779
Therein lies
the unspeakable thing

06:28.823 --> 06:31.782
out of which
our life together was born.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.396
Every time you think of me,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
I feel the old ties pulling.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.185
Every time you look at her,

06:43.228 --> 06:45.666
you feel new ones growing.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.673
She isn't you.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.110
No.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.417
She still has a choice.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.891
That's the Marcia login info.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.719
Check the balance.

07:38.762 --> 07:41.461
I trust you're able
to divide by two.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.203
I don't understand.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.249
What don't you understand?

07:50.208 --> 07:52.341
You just said no.

07:52.384 --> 07:55.126
Now you're saying yes.
I don't understand.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.914
Money isn't a measure
of anything to me,

07:59.914 --> 08:03.831
except the ability
to protect my family.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.398
My daughter--
she's in danger right now.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.836
I just found out
before I got here.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.928
All I can think about
are all the ways that things

08:13.928 --> 08:16.539
could go wrong,
ways she can get hurt.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.541
I had to do something about it.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.804
I don't have time for this.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.719
And once I leave,
I'm not coming back.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.289
I'm on a plane to Morocco
tomorrow, early morning.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.769
- Morocco?
- Yeah.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.335
What... I don't... W-W...

08:30.379 --> 08:32.381
What is happening?

08:39.214 --> 08:41.695
Zoe, it's-it's
a very long story.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.700
Come with me,
I'll tell you everything.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.186
Come with me, please.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.369
Why are we here?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.548
What are you so afraid
that Russian is gonna say?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.336
My name.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.040
How would he know your name?

13:04.305 --> 13:06.916
You are kidding me.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.440
I would think out of anyone,
you would be able to understand.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.225
That you're spying for the
Russians against your husband?

13:13.444 --> 13:16.099
For my husband.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.799
The Russians will leave one day.
I know it, you know it,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.062
and the Russians know it.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.326
Sooner or later, everyone will
realize the important question

13:25.369 --> 13:28.459
is the one I have been asking

13:28.459 --> 13:30.461
Who rules when they're gone?

13:30.461 --> 13:32.681
For some time now,

13:32.724 --> 13:35.466
I have been feeding
information to the GRU

13:35.466 --> 13:37.729
to undermine
and weaken our rivals,

13:37.773 --> 13:40.471
so that, when the time comes,
my husband

13:40.471 --> 13:42.647
will be in a position
to finish what we started

13:42.691 --> 13:44.954
and lead this country forward.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.406
I see it.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.239
I mean,

14:09.283 --> 14:11.459
if anyone here were to catch
even a whiff of this,

14:11.502 --> 14:12.852
you'll hang for it.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.246
So would your husband.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.337
Probably me, too,
for whatever that's worth.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.078
I know.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.559
You have to tell him.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.517
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.563
He's smart.
He'll understand.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.958
He might understand this,
but certainly not the rest.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.350
I seriously doubt there's
something more difficult

14:33.394 --> 14:35.091
to understand than this.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.969
A few months ago,

14:42.969 --> 14:46.537
I was visiting the wife
of a tribal elder

14:46.537 --> 14:49.105
in a village I will not name,
in a valley I will not name.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.935
And one late night
we were alone,

14:52.979 --> 14:55.546
and she confided in me a story.

14:55.546 --> 14:59.333
A man had descended
from the mountains, alone.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.423
He spoke no language
she recognized.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.252
He died on their doorstep
and they burned his body.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.517
A few weeks later,
I heard from the Russians

15:09.560 --> 15:13.173
that they had become aware
of a foreign prospecting crew,

15:13.216 --> 15:15.131
Greek pirates.

15:15.175 --> 15:18.004
This crew had found something

15:18.004 --> 15:20.963
beyond their
wildest expectations.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.314
A mineral deposit of...

15:24.358 --> 15:26.534
unimaginable value.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.580
- What kind of a deposit?
- A copper lode

15:29.580 --> 15:31.974
that, alone, could alter
this country's economy.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.194
And secrets buried beneath it.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.805
Deep veins of lithium, uranium.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.328
The Russians need it.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.722
They just can't find it.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.509
So, the Russians
don't know where it is.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.210
Do you?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.608
That mine makes Faraz Hamzad

15:57.652 --> 15:59.741
the next president
of Afghanistan.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.786
Why wouldn't you tell him?

16:01.830 --> 16:04.964
It would make him king.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.401
Which is why I cannot tell him.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.099
He must prevail.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.667
He must be the one to lead us
once this war ends,

16:12.710 --> 16:15.800
but as the Faraz Hamzad
I believe in,

16:15.844 --> 16:17.106
the one you believe in.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.197
Not like this.
Too much power, too quickly.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.635
This kind of power

16:24.635 --> 16:26.202
turn men against each other.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.421
It turns them dark.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.989
He isn't that kind of a man.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.556
Eventually, all men break.

16:41.522 --> 16:44.133
You are juggling
chain saws, lady.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.442
I'm pretty good at this,

16:48.485 --> 16:50.183
and even I'm having
a hard time keeping up.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.145
There are so many ways
this could kill you.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.671
Which is why I can no longer
do it alone.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.163
So, that's what this is about?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.165
That's why Hamzad is after you.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.038
Yeah.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.739
I'm feeling that there's a

17:24.782 --> 17:27.263
difficult conversation
that we should have.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.398
Oh, fuck, what's that?

17:31.441 --> 17:34.879
I am forging the name
of this woman who

17:34.923 --> 17:37.404
toyed with empires and...

17:39.710 --> 17:43.149
I'm not the Marcia Dixon
you planned for.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.804
I am not built
for this kind of thing.

17:46.848 --> 17:50.156
Yeah, says the woman who just
separated me from half my money.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.202
Well, that was different.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.730
You don't get
what you can do, do you?

17:59.730 --> 18:02.516
Well, in my world,

18:02.516 --> 18:04.344
you spend a lot of time

18:04.387 --> 18:06.128
learning to find
the cracks in things,

18:06.172 --> 18:08.348
you know, fractures.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.437
Fragile points in things

18:10.480 --> 18:12.961
where pushing a little
can change a lot.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.877
It's a sense that you
work hard to develop,

18:15.920 --> 18:18.140
an intuition for weakness.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.490
Most people, you know,

18:20.534 --> 18:23.363
they don't see
the world that way.

18:23.406 --> 18:26.757
No, we prefer to, well,
see things whole.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.195
Taught to keep things whole.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.588
Life's easier when
things are whole.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.503
I look at you,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.766
I see a person
who doesn't need to

18:35.766 --> 18:38.334
look for cracks in anything.
You...

18:39.770 --> 18:41.598
You just see 'em.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.210
I think no one's

18:44.210 --> 18:46.342
ever offered you
any idea how to use it

18:46.386 --> 18:48.605
or what it's for,
and I think that

18:48.649 --> 18:51.826
you can only ignore an ability
like that for so long

18:51.869 --> 18:55.395
before it finds a way
to remind you it's there.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.266
How can you say something
like that?

18:57.310 --> 19:00.400
How can you...
You barely know me.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.490
Well, um, I barely know you,
but I know the game.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.276
I know when someone's
seeing the angles.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.365
So, unless you're
a highly-trained operative

19:09.409 --> 19:12.629
pretending to be
a suburban divorcée,

19:12.673 --> 19:15.719
I have to assume that this is
a natural ability you've got.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.421
I am not
a highly-trained operative

19:21.464 --> 19:22.944
pretending to be anything.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.338
Oh. Yeah.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.383
I didn't think so.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.389
So, I'm here.

19:35.043 --> 19:38.829
You want me to be here

19:38.873 --> 19:40.657
because this is...

19:40.701 --> 19:42.659
curious to you--

19:42.703 --> 19:44.748
someone who has this ability?

19:44.748 --> 19:45.836
Yeah.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.407
Or I-I'm here,
you want me to be here

19:51.451 --> 19:54.280
because this is the only way
to keep me safe

19:54.323 --> 19:55.281
from whoever's
trying to kill you.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.199
Yeah.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.157
Or maybe I'm here

20:02.201 --> 20:04.681
because I am someone

20:04.725 --> 20:06.814
who can see
the cracks in things,

20:06.857 --> 20:09.860
and there's something
you're worried is broken,

20:09.860 --> 20:12.907
and you just can't
figure out where.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.865
Why, is there something
that looks broken to you?

20:15.866 --> 20:18.391
I don't know yet.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.566
You want me to guess?

20:24.527 --> 20:25.572
No.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.799
What you are asking of me,

20:35.843 --> 20:38.062
it isn't possible.

20:38.106 --> 20:41.501
- Why not?
- He's my father.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.198
He raised me,

20:43.242 --> 20:45.722
he gave me life.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.246
You're my father,
you raised me,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.726
you gave me purpose.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.729
You are each a part of...

20:52.773 --> 20:56.255
of who I am.
I-I don't divide that way.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.473
Sure you do.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.693
Everyone does.
We all do that.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.042
Well, I don't know
how to do that.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.913
Okay then.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.829
Let me make it simple for you.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.266
Take me to him.

21:10.225 --> 21:13.359
Do that. Lead me to him.
End this,

21:13.402 --> 21:16.623
and you will have made a choice
about who you want to be.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.281
Fuck you.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.637
Maybe I was wrong.

21:33.466 --> 21:36.947
That I mattered to you
in any way.

21:36.991 --> 21:40.516
That I've ever
mattered to you in any way.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.302
Because if I did,
you would understand

21:43.345 --> 21:46.305
how confusing this is for me.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.700
And just how hard I am trying

21:50.744 --> 21:53.268
to do the right thing.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.402
Make a choice?

21:56.445 --> 21:58.752
I mean, you're asking me
to amputate

21:58.752 --> 22:00.493
parts of myself
that are connected in ways

22:00.536 --> 22:03.104
that I don't even understand.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.933
And why?

22:05.976 --> 22:07.456
So that you can trust me?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.591
There are so many different ways

22:11.634 --> 22:13.984
we could've gone about
having this conversation,

22:13.984 --> 22:16.247
and you have succeeded in
choosing the absolute shittiest.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.946
This isn't about my state
of mind. You're a criminal.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.559
Well, I guess
I'm in good company, then.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.261
Or did you not send an assassin

22:30.305 --> 22:32.220
to kill my father before

22:32.220 --> 22:33.352
our SWAT team arrived?

22:40.924 --> 22:44.014
And you know what?

22:44.014 --> 22:46.365
I found a way

22:46.408 --> 22:48.628
to be okay with that.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.589
You helped my father escape

22:53.633 --> 22:55.548
Faraz Hamzad,

22:55.591 --> 22:59.247
and you didn't want
anyone knowing about it.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.379
It's all in the game.

23:02.032 --> 23:05.819
If the shoe was on the other
blah, blah, blah.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.560
But you know what's

23:07.603 --> 23:10.824
actually making it
very difficult

23:10.824 --> 23:12.739
for me to look you
in the eye right now?

23:17.265 --> 23:20.007
You knew that
there was something

23:20.050 --> 23:21.835
I had never
told you about myself.

23:23.532 --> 23:26.317
And you waited till we were all

23:26.361 --> 23:28.407
under a spotlight
with that lawyer.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.760
And you said...

23:35.283 --> 23:37.633
...my mother's name.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.593
Her birth name.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.249
Just to see if I'd react.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.601
To see if you were right.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.868
Do you know that that was the
first time I had heard her name

23:54.911 --> 23:57.218
since she had told it to me
when I was a kid?

24:01.614 --> 24:04.094
Can you imagine what that
would feel like if I-if I

24:04.094 --> 24:06.270
sharpened Chip's name
and used it to cut you open

24:06.314 --> 24:07.837
just to see what came out?

24:13.713 --> 24:15.802
How would you like me
to address you?

24:15.802 --> 24:17.717
Jesus.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.328
What difference does it make
what my name is?

24:20.328 --> 24:21.895
It makes all the difference.

24:21.938 --> 24:24.071
It's how you choose.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.812
It what...
It's what keeps all of us

24:25.855 --> 24:27.596
from having to juggle
all the different people

24:27.640 --> 24:30.120
that we feel like
we might want to be.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.949
The name's the thing.
You only get one.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.517
It plants a flag in the ground

24:35.561 --> 24:37.258
that-that says,
"This is who I am.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.521
Here is where I stand."

24:39.565 --> 24:41.305
You protect it with your life.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.790
When I'm gone, my name

24:47.834 --> 24:51.533
is all that my family
will have left of me.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.318
And the greatest threat to it

24:54.362 --> 24:56.364
is the mole
that I have apparently

24:56.407 --> 24:57.713
been harboring for a decade.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.239
You made that decision

25:02.283 --> 25:04.154
for all of us.

25:04.198 --> 25:07.027
And at this moment,

25:07.070 --> 25:09.769
I'm not inclined to make you
feel better about it.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.167
Where are we?

26:00.210 --> 26:02.169
Just, uh...

26:02.212 --> 26:04.563
wait here.

26:14.224 --> 26:15.965
Come on, guys.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.054
Come on.

26:59.487 --> 27:00.706
<i>Bleib!</i>

27:03.404 --> 27:04.840
<i>Bleib.</i>

27:49.537 --> 27:51.887
You know, in my experience,
it's polite to ask someone

27:51.887 --> 27:54.716
before leaving them
two giant dogs.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.327
They don't know anybody else.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.864
Wherever we're going,
you don't plan on

28:11.907 --> 28:13.692
coming back at all, do you?

28:16.216 --> 28:19.393
What I'm good for...

28:19.436 --> 28:21.917
what I'm built for,
is defending things

28:21.917 --> 28:23.571
that need d-defending.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.399
All the best things
I've done in my life

28:25.442 --> 28:26.530
have been in service of that.

28:29.403 --> 28:31.144
Once I'm done with Hamzad,

28:31.187 --> 28:32.885
both you and Emily'll
be all right.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.148
You know?
And what happens to me, um,

28:35.191 --> 28:37.324
happens to me,
that's-that's not important.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.155
Both of you will be all right.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.919
- Ray.
- Chief.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.487
Listen, you're about to
get a phone call.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.011
I want you to answer it

29:12.054 --> 29:14.143
and I want you to do
whatever you're told.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.493
Yes, sir.
Uh, may I ask who it is

29:16.537 --> 29:17.973
- I'll be talking to?
- Just want you to do
whatever you're told, Ray.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.847
And I cannot
stress this enough--

29:21.890 --> 29:24.414
don't question him, don't pry,

29:24.414 --> 29:25.546
- don't...
- Don't be me.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.115
Yes, sir.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.821
This is Waters.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.345

<i>Mr. Waters, how are you?</i>

29:42.345 --> 29:43.346
I'm fine.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.261
<i>Grand.</i>

29:45.305 --> 29:47.655
<i>Mr. Waters,</i>
<i>at this moment in time,</i>

29:47.698 --> 29:49.918
<i>I believe you and I are fated</i>

29:49.962 --> 29:52.616
<i>to mean something</i>
<i>to one another.</i>

29:52.660 --> 29:55.228
You see, I need some help,

29:55.271 --> 29:57.056
and I believe you're
the only person on earth

29:57.099 --> 29:59.449
who can provide it.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.364
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

30:03.018 --> 30:05.891
Harold Harper is missing.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.243
I understand you were
the last to see him,

30:10.286 --> 30:12.027
is that correct?

30:12.027 --> 30:14.377
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Yes, sir, I believe it is.</i>

30:14.421 --> 30:16.205
Oh, good.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.732
I'm putting together
a small team.

30:21.776 --> 30:25.040
I'd like you
to be a part of it.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.303
Please stand by,

30:27.347 --> 30:29.610
and I will get you instructions
on where to go next.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.621
Where were you hit?

30:42.710 --> 30:44.625
I'm fine.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.584
Where did the bullet

30:47.628 --> 30:48.847
hit you?

30:55.941 --> 31:00.119
You know that I'm a liar
when it suits me to be.

31:00.162 --> 31:03.252
An apology from a liar
is no apology at all.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.345
But I hope you will believe me
when I tell you this.

31:09.389 --> 31:13.349
I'm very sorry

31:13.393 --> 31:16.135
that I put you in that position.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.661
I believe you believe that.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.145
But I'm not really here
for an apology.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.582
I just need to know
what happened.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.498
I want to know
if you're apologizing because

31:31.541 --> 31:33.108
you didn't want to tell me
Harold Harper

31:33.152 --> 31:35.415
had a mole in his office,

31:35.415 --> 31:37.547
or if you couldn't tell me
Harold Harper had a mole

31:37.547 --> 31:39.854
in his office
because you didn't know.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.163
Didn't know?

31:44.206 --> 31:46.034
I put her there.

31:49.733 --> 31:52.127
- Hold on.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.477
Where are you going?

31:54.477 --> 31:56.784
Mike was worried

31:56.827 --> 31:58.917
that you were
losing your marbles.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.179
This is just you up to some shit

32:00.222 --> 32:02.921
that I don't want to know.

32:02.964 --> 32:06.315
- You're fine.
- If I were fine,

32:06.359 --> 32:09.101
would I be sitting here
with you right now?

32:12.147 --> 32:14.584
What do you mean?

32:14.584 --> 32:16.325
I put the mole

32:16.369 --> 32:18.414
in Harold Harper's office

32:18.458 --> 32:21.591
because Dan Chase

32:21.635 --> 32:22.941
asked me to.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.596
I did the one thing
you must never do

32:26.640 --> 32:28.076
in this business. I...

32:29.686 --> 32:31.993
I tried to be a good father.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.691
I'm sorry,

32:34.735 --> 32:37.956
Dan Chase is your son?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.522
More or less.

32:39.566 --> 32:43.178
More...

32:43.178 --> 32:45.572
than less.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.530
He and Harold both.

32:51.621 --> 32:54.059
I broke the rules.

32:57.062 --> 33:00.152
And I never wanted
anyone to know about it.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.331
I don't think anyone
should've known about it.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.117
But I should've known about it.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.774
Well, now you know.

33:15.645 --> 33:18.474
And now I'm gonna ask you
to help me clean it up,

33:18.518 --> 33:22.130
so that no one else ever will.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.524
Gonna ask you to do the one
thing a good father must

33:24.567 --> 33:27.005
never, ever do.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.229
I'm gonna ask you
to hurt my sons.

33:45.545 --> 33:48.809
Nine hours.
East-southeast.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.074
North Africa somewhere.

34:06.261 --> 34:09.525
Hey, w-where the hell are we?

34:09.569 --> 34:10.831
I think it's Tunis.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.138
Okay.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.709
Does that mean anything to you?

34:19.753 --> 34:22.147
Oh, it could be
once I stopped here

34:22.147 --> 34:23.931
on a Mediterranean cruise
with Cheryl

34:23.931 --> 34:27.195
for our 15th anniversary.

34:27.239 --> 34:31.156
Or it could be the last place
your mother and father stopped

34:31.156 --> 34:33.332
on their way from Afghanistan
to the United States.

34:35.769 --> 34:38.032
If he looked for her,

34:38.076 --> 34:39.773
this is almost certainly

34:39.816 --> 34:42.297
where he lost her trail,

34:42.297 --> 34:44.908
where she disappeared.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.693
Though, what that matters now...

34:48.521 --> 34:50.088
...I couldn't say.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.354
Someone's coming.

35:11.326 --> 35:13.328
Harper?

35:14.329 --> 35:15.243
Yeah.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.778
That's his house-- Zachary?

36:11.821 --> 36:14.259
Yeah.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.782
What are you gonna do in there?

36:18.350 --> 36:20.569
Well, to get this meeting
I need with Pavlovich,

36:20.613 --> 36:23.181
I need Zachary to authorize
this investment,

36:23.181 --> 36:26.140
uh, open the door.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.229
I asked him nice at lunch.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.231
Now I just need to get it done.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.190
You're gonna threaten him?

36:36.890 --> 36:38.587
What if I went in there instead?

36:38.631 --> 36:40.459
What?

36:40.502 --> 36:43.201
Wasn't... Marcia Dixon

36:43.201 --> 36:46.247
somebody to them, too?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.075
Yeah. Why?

36:49.685 --> 36:52.993
Well, you asked nicely,
you-you can't ask nicely again,

36:53.036 --> 36:54.821
or you're weak,

36:54.864 --> 36:56.039
but I could ask nicely,

36:56.083 --> 36:58.651
or at least
I could ask differently.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.093
Well, sending my wife in there

37:06.136 --> 37:09.096
i-isn't exactly gonna
make me look like John Wayne.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.011
I think that's
the problem, exactly.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.100
You're not going in there

37:13.143 --> 37:15.276
to get what you need,
you're going in there to...

37:15.320 --> 37:18.410
to force him to give it to you.

37:20.542 --> 37:23.110
A little while ago--
just for a second--

37:23.153 --> 37:25.243
you saw me as a threat
to your daughter.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.896
Just for a second.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.681
And I didn't mean to be,

37:28.724 --> 37:30.857
and I wouldn't want
to be, but...

37:30.900 --> 37:33.251
just for a second,

37:33.294 --> 37:35.122
I feared for my life.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.169
Now, maybe it's-it's been
a long time

37:39.213 --> 37:42.390
since you've had to be that guy.

37:42.434 --> 37:45.785
To use violence to protect
the people that you love.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.744
But maybe...

37:48.788 --> 37:52.139
that's an urge that can
only be suppressed for so long

37:52.182 --> 37:55.664
before it finds a way

37:55.708 --> 37:58.188
to remind you that it's there.

37:58.232 --> 38:01.191
And maybe, once it's out,

38:01.235 --> 38:03.846
it for damn sure
doesn't want to be put back.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.723
What would you say?

38:13.639 --> 38:15.293
Uh...

38:16.511 --> 38:18.296
Uh...

38:18.339 --> 38:21.211
I don't know. Uh...

38:21.255 --> 38:22.952
- I might...
- Well, he's risk averse

38:22.952 --> 38:25.564
when it comes to money,

38:25.607 --> 38:28.044
but he's not to rule-breaking.
You know,

38:28.088 --> 38:30.003
you could...

38:30.046 --> 38:32.484
Uh, yeah, you could
tell him that you...

38:32.527 --> 38:34.573
you overheard me on the phone,

38:34.616 --> 38:36.183
you think I maybe
I might have some kind

38:36.183 --> 38:39.578
of inside information
on this deal,

38:39.621 --> 38:42.276
and that, uh, you're
concerned that, uh,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.409
it's illegal, you know.

38:46.759 --> 38:49.762
Um... All right,
this is a real bad idea.

38:49.762 --> 38:52.982
- No, wait, uh, wait here.
- Why?

38:52.982 --> 38:55.811
Well... if you
fuck it up a little,

38:55.855 --> 38:58.161
he slams the door
in your face, you know,

38:58.205 --> 39:00.903
you fuck it up a lot, uh...

39:00.903 --> 39:04.603
Zoe. Zoe, wait...

39:04.646 --> 39:05.908
Oh, fuck.

39:18.051 --> 39:21.010
- It's 11:00.
- Yeah.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.230
- I'm dressed like this.
- Yeah.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.231
How do I explain that to him?

39:27.452 --> 39:30.237
Rich folks don't explain shit.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.220
- Hello.
- Zachary?

39:58.831 --> 40:00.833
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I didn't quite catch your name.

40:00.833 --> 40:01.834
Uh, Marcia.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.792
Dixon.
We haven't met yet.

40:03.836 --> 40:06.186
- I'm, uh, I'm Henry's wife.
- Uh, yeah.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.796
- Hi.
- Right, of course.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.363
- Pleasure to finally meet you.
- Likewise.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.888
Um, so, listen, I-I'm, uh,

40:12.932 --> 40:14.673
I'm sorry to bother you,
I know it's really late.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.326
Yeah, a bit.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.546
But there is something
I'd like to talk to you about,

40:18.590 --> 40:20.069
and it's a little
time-sensitive,

40:20.069 --> 40:22.594
so I thought maybe it would be
better out of the office.

40:22.637 --> 40:25.814
I'm happy to chat,
but, uh, now is...

40:25.858 --> 40:27.729
not really a great time.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.428
Of course, of course.
It'll only take a minute.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.081
Tell you what,

40:32.125 --> 40:34.301
why don't we connect

40:34.344 --> 40:36.434
tomorrow over coffee?

40:36.434 --> 40:39.001
I'll cancel a meeting.
Cool?

40:43.092 --> 40:45.878
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.532
- Okay.
- Night.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.664
All right.
Sorry to have bothered you.

41:20.390 --> 41:22.044
Everything cool, Marcia?

41:23.263 --> 41:25.352
I wasn't finished, Zachary.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.326
Here we are again.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.680
A closed door.

41:48.723 --> 41:51.117
Something new
preparing to emerge.

41:53.075 --> 41:56.296
Something that will change
everything about you and I.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.734
She can do it.

41:59.734 --> 42:02.345
Not that door.
You.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.349
So much

42:06.393 --> 42:08.743
stored away.

42:08.743 --> 42:10.876
No one to confess it to.

42:15.924 --> 42:18.710
You.

42:18.753 --> 42:22.148
I cannot be your confessor.

42:22.191 --> 42:24.716
I don't belong here.

42:24.759 --> 42:26.544
Held to you by...

42:28.763 --> 42:32.332
...a whisper, a leash,

42:32.332 --> 42:33.986
a sorrow.

42:36.249 --> 42:39.557
I am your prisoner here.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.560
When you are finally opened,

42:42.603 --> 42:45.780
I cannot be the one
to forgive you

42:45.780 --> 42:47.565
for what spills out.

42:52.004 --> 42:53.701
Someone

42:53.745 --> 42:56.443
- must choose to do that.

42:56.443 --> 42:58.619
Someone whole enough

42:58.663 --> 43:00.795
to choose.

43:07.062 --> 43:09.021
I will miss you.

43:58.853 --> 44:00.855
Maintenance records.

44:04.511 --> 44:06.905
Passenger manifests.

44:06.948 --> 44:09.951
- What the hell is going on?
- It's a test.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.910
They want to see if I can find
the needle in the haystack.

44:11.953 --> 44:14.652
You want to find
something in here,

44:14.695 --> 44:17.089
you have to be here to find it.

44:17.089 --> 44:18.438
Find what?
What are you looking for?

44:18.438 --> 44:20.919
A flight from Karachi.

44:20.962 --> 44:23.225
April of 1987.

44:25.358 --> 44:27.839
The flight that
your parents took.

44:35.368 --> 44:37.196
You know that flight?

44:37.239 --> 44:39.851
I arranged it.

44:39.894 --> 44:43.724
When you exfil an asset
from a hot zone,

44:43.768 --> 44:47.162
you fly them out
on an agency bird.

44:47.206 --> 44:49.730
When things go so wrong
that you don't want anyone

44:49.774 --> 44:51.689
at the Agency
to know about it...

44:53.995 --> 44:57.346
...that's when you
have to get creative.

44:57.346 --> 44:59.044
And this was a part of it.

45:10.969 --> 45:12.710
What went badly?

45:16.583 --> 45:18.106
He didn't tell you?

45:25.374 --> 45:28.682
You can be a spy

45:28.726 --> 45:30.597
or you can be a parent.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.165
It's exceedingly difficult
to be both at once.

45:35.515 --> 45:36.777
Your father

45:36.821 --> 45:39.084
has always

45:39.127 --> 45:41.608
believed

45:41.651 --> 45:43.915
that he could be
whatever he decides

45:43.958 --> 45:46.308
in whatever moment
he decides it.

45:48.441 --> 45:50.312
That's how all of this happened.

45:55.056 --> 45:57.319
I'm sorry this is the hand
you were dealt.

45:58.973 --> 46:00.845
You didn't deserve it.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.609

<i>Mr. Harper.</i>

46:26.653 --> 46:29.612
Azur Maroc Air.
Flight 31.

46:32.093 --> 46:34.269
That's what you wanted me
to find, isn't it?

46:34.313 --> 46:36.489
<i>Yes.</i>

46:36.532 --> 46:39.231
So why am I here?

46:39.231 --> 46:41.015
What else do you want to know?

46:41.059 --> 46:43.235
<i>On the manifest.</i>

46:43.235 --> 46:46.107
<i>What were their seat numbers?</i>

46:46.151 --> 46:48.501
You mean, do I remember
what their aliases were

46:48.544 --> 46:50.242
30 years ago?

46:53.332 --> 46:55.595
Fuck.

47:04.909 --> 47:08.434
7A and 7B.

47:08.477 --> 47:10.218
<i>Is that all?</i>

47:10.262 --> 47:12.351
What else is there?

47:12.351 --> 47:14.657
Haven't I proven that I know
what I'm talking about?

47:14.701 --> 47:16.094
Isn't that what
this is all about?

47:18.487 --> 47:20.011
<i>The memorandum</i>
<i>detailing your guilt</i>

47:20.054 --> 47:21.839
<i>will be distributed</i>
<i>before end of day.</i>

47:21.882 --> 47:24.276
What?

47:24.276 --> 47:26.408
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- Hello...

47:26.408 --> 47:28.454
Hello?

47:28.497 --> 47:30.195
- Oh, fuck.

47:32.197 --> 47:33.981
Jesus.

47:38.420 --> 47:39.987
You were framed.

47:43.338 --> 47:46.733
Targeted by a bad actor

47:46.776 --> 47:49.214
from your past
who had an axe to grind.

47:51.390 --> 47:53.087
The U.S. government,

47:53.131 --> 47:56.134
who you dedicated
your life's service,

47:56.177 --> 47:58.919
turned its back on you,

47:58.963 --> 48:01.966
so you fought alone
to unveil the truth.

48:02.009 --> 48:03.924
And when you did,
that government

48:03.968 --> 48:06.144
welcomed you home
with open arms.

48:06.187 --> 48:07.928
What the fuck
are you talking about?

48:07.972 --> 48:10.235
That is the story
that we will tell.

48:12.977 --> 48:16.241
After Faraz Hamzad is dead.

48:20.985 --> 48:23.117
My father's working on it
right now.

48:25.337 --> 48:27.252
I suggest we go find him.

48:29.994 --> 48:31.473
And lend a hand.

48:49.143 --> 48:50.971
You did good tonight.

49:02.635 --> 49:05.768
Can I ask what you said to him?

49:05.812 --> 49:08.336
I just asked for what I wanted.

49:08.380 --> 49:11.078
Oh, you just asked, huh?
Okay.

49:13.037 --> 49:15.126
When-when you asked, I think he

49:15.169 --> 49:18.346
saw... an old man

49:18.390 --> 49:19.957
telling him how to do his job,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.350
but when I asked, I-I...

49:22.394 --> 49:24.135
Who knows what he saw, but...

49:24.178 --> 49:26.789
but that was his weakness.

49:26.833 --> 49:28.748
And it was apparent to me,

49:28.748 --> 49:31.403
and I pushed on it, and...

49:31.403 --> 49:34.188
- he gave in.
- He gave in.

49:35.885 --> 49:37.931
Yeah, that must have felt good.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.106
It did.

49:44.285 --> 49:46.592
You know, where we're going,

49:46.635 --> 49:49.247
weakness is a lot harder
to find.

49:49.290 --> 49:53.033
The weak are mostly dead.

49:53.077 --> 49:56.123
You go, uh, bolting out
of the car like that again

49:56.167 --> 49:59.344
because you feel you've
got something to prove--

49:59.387 --> 50:03.000
hell, because you think
you can save me from myself--

50:03.043 --> 50:05.306
you take a run at the wrong guy,

50:05.350 --> 50:07.787
we both end up dismembered
in a bathtub.

50:12.966 --> 50:15.795
Well, good thing you're someone
who would never let that happen.

50:17.492 --> 50:19.103
Yeah, good thing.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.936
That isn't all you are,
you know?

50:26.980 --> 50:29.113
That isn't all you're built for.

50:29.113 --> 50:32.116
A person who protects things.

50:32.116 --> 50:35.249
A person who doesn't
want or need anything else.

50:35.249 --> 50:37.295
A person who isn't even
a person at all.

50:37.338 --> 50:38.948
There's more than that.

50:38.992 --> 50:41.995
There's other parts.
There's better parts.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.215
And I see them.

50:44.258 --> 50:46.086
I see you.

50:53.485 --> 50:56.140
What is it?

50:59.534 --> 51:01.493
The series of events
that it took

51:01.536 --> 51:03.799
to create this moment,

51:03.843 --> 51:05.671
well...

51:05.714 --> 51:08.065
From where you and I started
before all this,

51:08.108 --> 51:09.631
you know, to reach this point...

51:09.631 --> 51:12.286
I don't care.

51:12.330 --> 51:15.724
However we got here,
we're here.

51:15.768 --> 51:19.685
And where I started,

51:19.728 --> 51:21.687
before all this began,

51:21.730 --> 51:23.515
I think...

51:23.515 --> 51:26.083
it maybe is a place that
I don't miss very much.

51:29.521 --> 51:31.436
Do you?

51:33.438 --> 51:34.700
No.

51:40.184 --> 51:42.534
Maybe that's why I'm here, then.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.974
A reminder.

51:48.017 --> 51:50.672
