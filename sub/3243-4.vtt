00:00.001 --> 00:04.236
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.238 --> 00:06.038
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:10.509
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:13.445
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:13.447 --> 00:16.415
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:16.417 --> 00:18.217
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:18.219 --> 00:22.354
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.490
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:28.162 --> 00:32.031
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...
 Alan: <i> The military covered up</i>
  <i> a giant hole in the earth.</i>

00:32.033 --> 00:33.298
     And i think this piece
   of meteorite has something

00:33.300 --> 00:34.049
                  To do with it.

00:34.050 --> 00:34.799
               Where's the rock?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.068
I left it right here.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.336
       (tires screeching)
              hey!

00:37.338 --> 00:41.306
        Hey! Wait! Stop!

00:41.308 --> 00:44.276
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.277
But they're
regular people,

00:45.279 --> 00:46.362
               Just like we are.

00:46.363 --> 00:47.446
Except the devil
is tempting each of them

00:47.448 --> 00:49.148
      To commit some kind
        of terrible sin,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.417
       And once they do,
    they're no longer human.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.069
                  They've broken
                 a fateful seal.

00:53.070 --> 00:54.720
                 The seven seals
              of the apocalypse.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.822
   I think the prime minister
   is about to commit a sin.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.457
         <i> The imam said</i>
      <i> even his own people</i>

00:58.459 --> 01:00.426
       <i> Would curse him. </i>
   The visions clearly point

01:00.428 --> 01:02.761
      <i> To senator richards.</i>
       <i> I think it's her.</i>

01:02.763 --> 01:04.296
     What if it's neither?
The energy summit's

01:04.298 --> 01:05.564
   Tomorrow night. The prime
    minister and the senator

01:05.566 --> 01:07.099
Will both
be there.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.067
        Then so will we.

01:08.069 --> 01:08.951
        (sirens wailing)

01:08.952 --> 01:09.834
                    Peter moore.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.770
         You're under arrest for
       the murder of sam murphy.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.610
        (birds chirping)

01:21.415 --> 01:23.482
 (grunts)

01:24.485 --> 01:26.318
           Any luck?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.320
      Had a bail bondsmen
   check into peter's status.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.456
          He was taken
     to harris county jail.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.459
 Now, it's not exactly a place
     i can walk into, so...

01:33.461 --> 01:35.094
     It's all i could get.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.297
Yeah. I'll go see
what i can find out.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.299
   I still can't believe it.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.101
   I mean, that kid? Murder?

01:42.103 --> 01:44.203
                  It's got to be
           some kind of mistake.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.172
 Either way, peter's one of us.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.140
  And we need to work together
 if we want to have any chance

01:48.142 --> 01:49.641
    Of stopping the senator
       or prime minister

01:49.643 --> 01:53.645
At that energy summit
tonight.

01:56.851 --> 02:00.185
                           Rose:
                        What are
                    you reading?

02:00.187 --> 02:02.554
    Chapter six, verse four.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.524
"and there went out
another horse that was red:

02:05.526 --> 02:07.593
  "and power was given to him
        that sat thereon

02:07.595 --> 02:09.428
 To take peace from the earth."

02:09.430 --> 02:11.897
 It says a third of all people
  on the earth will be killed

02:11.899 --> 02:14.633
   After the horsemen unite.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.269
   That's two billion people.

02:19.373 --> 02:23.375
           You look tired, josh.
       Did you sleep last night?

02:23.377 --> 02:24.526
              No.

02:24.527 --> 02:25.676
Who could sleep
with all the terrible things

02:25.679 --> 02:26.879
That are about
to happen?

02:26.881 --> 02:28.881
     I mean, it's prophecy.
          It's all...

02:28.883 --> 02:31.683
  It's all written right here.
                       On paper.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.453
  It's not chiseled in stone.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.621
                          God is
                     testing us,

02:35.623 --> 02:37.623
            Joshua.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.293
         Our fate lies
    in the choices we make.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.897
           Yeah. I...

02:44.899 --> 02:48.433
 In that case, i guess i better
   get a fresh cup of coffee.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.502
        How 'bout decaf?
(chuckles)

02:52.573 --> 02:54.907
 (music playing, barking on tv)

02:57.511 --> 03:00.913
           Sorry about your dad.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.588
           (thumping)

03:16.197 --> 03:16.895
      What are you doing?

03:16.897 --> 03:19.364
     A science experiment.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.465
       Testing your gift?

03:20.467 --> 03:22.017
What did rose call it,

03:22.018 --> 03:23.568
        Spirit walking?
                 Yeah, it should
            be called defective,

03:23.571 --> 03:25.571
   'cause it no longer works.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.474
 Your gift was healing, right?

03:29.476 --> 03:31.877
                   Come with me.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.213
             Erin:
      I'm not sure i like
      where this is going.

03:34.215 --> 03:34.846
     Vera...

03:36.283 --> 03:37.816
                        Heal me.
    What?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.084
        What's going on?

03:39.085 --> 03:40.351
   Erin's trying to heal me.
                     You thought

03:40.354 --> 03:40.919
       About a band-aid?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.454
            (sighs)

03:42.456 --> 03:43.789
        I don't get it.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.657
    Why don't our gifts work
         all the time?

03:45.659 --> 03:47.326
      My question exactly.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.461
         Meanwhile, ow.
Sorry.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.362
            (shouts)

03:50.364 --> 03:51.330
Joshua.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.233
        (falcon crying)

04:04.478 --> 04:07.546
You have lost your mind, joshua!

04:07.548 --> 04:10.616
           (echoing):
    Even god can't help you!

04:15.623 --> 04:17.689
           (panting)

04:22.029 --> 04:22.928
  He just had another vision.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.829
               What did you see?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.664
           (panting)

04:25.666 --> 04:28.533
      I saw myself dying.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.846
How do you know you were dying?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.514
   There was a lot of blood.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.950
                 And, uh, my dad
              was yelling at me.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.551
            What about the other
            parts of the vision?

04:46.553 --> 04:48.353
           The arms breaking the
        shackles could be peter.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.289
          I mean, who else do we
        know that could do that?

04:50.291 --> 04:53.358
And what about the falcon? Maybe
it's symbolic for something.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.860
A hunter closing in
on the kill?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.461
         If you ask me,
 the dead soldiers might point

04:56.463 --> 04:58.630
     To the prime minister
    as our horseman of war.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.965
Vera: If god wants
to motivate us,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.466
What is with all the pictionary?

05:01.468 --> 05:03.435
   Why can't he just tell us
    what he wants us to do?

05:05.572 --> 05:07.089
     So what do we do now?

05:07.090 --> 05:08.607
  You should all go to austin
         and try to do

05:08.609 --> 05:09.675
Whatever you can
to stop the horseman

05:09.677 --> 05:11.277
    From committing the sin.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.878
        What about you?
I have to try and figure out
a way to get peter

05:12.880 --> 05:14.946
          Out of jail.
Then we'll join you guys there.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.415
Peter was chosen
to be a messenger.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.751
   His destiny lies with us,
          not in jail.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.361
    I think you should look
 into the prime minister first.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.363
   His country is this close
       to falling apart.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.898
  It's a dangerous situation.
Exactly.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.633
   And now we're gonna start
       messing with him?

05:34.635 --> 05:37.035
      A-a foreign leader.
 Not to mention a u.S. Senator.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.904
You realize if we're wrong about
 the visions, we could wind up

05:38.906 --> 05:41.540
           In prison.
                         Joshua:
                       Or worse.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.543
     Look, i get your reluctance
           to follow my visions.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.346
  N-no offense, but your most
 recent vision seems to be more

05:47.348 --> 05:50.615
About your personal life than it
does about finding any horseman.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.951
Maybe you should
look into that.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.087
         Was there anything else
          you saw in your vision

05:55.089 --> 05:57.489
              That could help us
     understand it more clearly?

05:59.626 --> 06:02.728
            (crying)

06:02.730 --> 06:04.863
         I'm not sure.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.398
           Well, you need to be.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.767
               So do whatever it
             takes to get there.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.739
You've heard
what joshua's dad's

06:13.741 --> 06:15.674
    Been saying in the news
       about him, right?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.075
     He's had mental issues
          in the past.

06:17.077 --> 06:20.078
We all have our crosses to bear.
Then how
can you be

06:20.080 --> 06:21.880
    So sure that his visions
           are legit?

06:21.882 --> 06:22.881
     You're the scientist.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.751
     Go prove they aren't.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.987
            (sighs)

06:28.989 --> 06:31.056
      (indistinct chatter)

06:34.561 --> 06:36.561
         (man coughing)

06:36.563 --> 06:38.730
  Woman: <i> They didn't give you</i>
          <i> any warning?</i>

06:38.732 --> 06:41.733
       Do they ever when they're
         passing out pink slips?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.403
               Woman: What about
               peter's adoption?

06:44.405 --> 06:47.439
             They won't grant it
           if you're unemployed.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.807
                They'll send him
        back to that group home.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.782
            (sighs)

07:19.673 --> 07:21.072
             Peter!

07:22.209 --> 07:24.476
                          Peter!

07:30.517 --> 07:31.983
            (gasps)

07:31.985 --> 07:34.820
      (coughing, gasping)

07:36.223 --> 07:38.123
             Whoa.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.691
                        Come on.
                        Get him.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.793
  (men chuckling, chattering)

07:41.795 --> 07:44.529
          Sorry, man.
    I didn't mean anything.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.697
You tripped
over my foot.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.865
 (shouting in foreign language)

07:46.867 --> 07:48.633
         No, i don't...
      I don't understand.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.244
Guard:
Hey!
(clang)

07:59.246 --> 08:00.212
                           Knock
                         it off!

08:10.791 --> 08:12.858
        (keys clacking)

08:15.162 --> 08:17.996
           (knocking)

08:19.132 --> 08:20.999
   Hey, i got to go to austin
          for the day.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.167
                         I know.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.836
     Erin already asked me
         to watch amy.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.139
         How you doing?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.207
           I'm fine.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.775
'cause it's okay
not to be fine.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.778
    You know, you don't have
  to be so tough all the time.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.548
 You know, if you need to cry,
          you can cry.
                      Over what?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.850
        My dad is gone.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.253
   No funeral, no gravestone,

08:41.255 --> 08:43.788
   No chance to say good-bye.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.857
        He's just gone.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.636
        (birds chirping)

09:01.942 --> 09:03.975
 Alan, what are you doing here?
        I could ask you

09:03.977 --> 09:05.710
       The same question.
                     How did you
                        find me?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.762
        I have my ways.
                           Well,
                      did you...

09:07.763 --> 09:09.813
         Did you get my message?
      Your cousin still works at
          the dmv. Is he looking

09:09.816 --> 09:12.234
                        Into the
                  license plate?
 He does. He's checking into it.

09:12.235 --> 09:14.653
  But meanwhile, there's still
   this nagging little issue.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.054
    Oh, my god. What was it?

09:16.056 --> 09:19.024
    Oh, yeah. You died on me
    twice in the last week.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.926
           I'm fine.
          Oh, are you?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.294
 'cause now you're hanging out
    at walter white's house

09:22.296 --> 09:23.562
With a bunch
of strange people

09:23.564 --> 09:24.829
  You've never, ever mentioned
            before.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.164
   Kind of begs the question,

09:26.166 --> 09:27.832
         What the hell?
                   Look, i can't
                       tell you.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.935
     So i need you to stop
   asking questions. Please.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.937
 Oh, i love games. Can i guess?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.271
Okay. Um,
you have

09:33.273 --> 09:34.906
         A secret life
     with a secret family.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.908
            Close. Look, i don't
               need you to worry

09:36.910 --> 09:38.777
      About me, okay? I need you
     to worry about figuring out

09:38.779 --> 09:39.911
          The name of the person
              who stole our rock

09:39.913 --> 09:41.279
By tracking down that van.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.615
        (car door opens)

09:43.617 --> 09:44.783
        (car door shuts)

09:44.785 --> 09:47.185
        (engine starts)

09:49.957 --> 09:51.623
         (door buzzes)

09:51.625 --> 09:53.692
Peter moore.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.763
Today
is your lucky day.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.133
    I'm your court-appointed
           attorney.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.409
No speeding, okay?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.010
I really don't want to get
pulled over by the cops again.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.645
First of all, you were driving.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.347
           Secondly,
   this car won't go over 35.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.319
Stop that.
                           What?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.887
Stay out of my head.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.357
       I'm not hearing anything.
             You know, my gift's

10:25.359 --> 10:27.192
       A lot like yours.
      I can't control it.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.094
    Sometimes i hear things,
       sometimes i don't.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.667
     You know, but as long
       as we're talking,

10:35.669 --> 10:37.836
         What happened
 between you and your husband?

10:39.206 --> 10:42.007
         I didn't hear anything.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.909
Okay, yeah, so i heard the thing

10:44.911 --> 10:47.078
 A few days ago about you being
     wanted for kidnapping,

10:47.080 --> 10:48.680
         But, you know,
       it's not my fault.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.848
      It's... I don't try.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.282
     It's not a superpower
          i asked for.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.985
            Why can't i fly? I'd
            rather fly. Look, if

10:53.987 --> 10:55.987
You don't want to talk about it,
we don't have to talk about it.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.689
 I don't want to talk about it.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.657
             Fine.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.924
                     Fine.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.359
        (engine starts)

11:01.361 --> 11:07.232
        (engine revving)

11:07.234 --> 11:09.300
Seriously?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.971
      (indistinct shouting
          of children)

11:26.086 --> 11:28.987
            (crying)

11:33.860 --> 11:35.694
       What do you want?

11:35.696 --> 11:38.129
 I need to speak to my sister.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.168
     <i> Now</i> you need to talk?

11:43.170 --> 11:46.071
  'cause you were pretty quiet
when dad kicked me to the curb.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.951
      That's your nephew. Caleb.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.886
                    Just started
                    first grade.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.054
         Loves t-ball.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.190
      Hits it a lot better

12:05.192 --> 12:07.258
              Than you ever did.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.361
         That's great.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.233
  You have a beautiful family.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.868
              For someone living
                 a deviant life.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.136
Dad called it that,

12:18.138 --> 12:19.771
    Not me.
                  But you didn't
                    say anything

12:19.773 --> 12:21.072
                  In my defense.
Look, it wasn't...

12:21.074 --> 12:25.110
  Easy... For me to come here.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.247
   I've been having these...

12:29.249 --> 12:31.249
           Dreams...

12:31.251 --> 12:33.985
About dad, and you were in them,
           too, hope.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.054
        You were crying.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.455
The image is...

12:37.457 --> 12:39.457
          Disturbing.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.993
      And i've been trying
     to understand what...

12:41.995 --> 12:43.828
               Wait, wait, wait.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.830
       Are you only here
     because i'm a shrink?

12:45.832 --> 12:47.365
     Because if you really
        need some help,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.000
  Let me refer you to someone.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.401
        I'm here because
       you're my sister!

12:54.407 --> 12:56.841
       (voice breaking):
     And i need your help.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.853
So, later today, you will be
extradited back to arkansas.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.889
As your attorney,
i strongly recommend

13:10.891 --> 13:12.991
That you plead guilty
to the murder charge.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.559
Hear me out.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.545
In the face
of the overwhelming evidence

13:16.546 --> 13:18.530
Against you, i believe it's the
most prudent thing to just...

13:18.532 --> 13:19.898
        What about self-defense?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.483
   Sam threatened to kill me.

13:21.484 --> 13:23.067
I've got a friend who's willing
      to testify to that.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.702
      Uh, you mean alice?

13:24.703 --> 13:26.336
  How do you think the police
     were able to find you?

13:26.339 --> 13:29.007
I'll do what i can

13:29.009 --> 13:30.508
 To get you a reduced sentence.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.078
You had a pretty rough ride.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.815
Lifelong depression,

13:36.817 --> 13:38.950
Suicide attempt,

13:38.952 --> 13:41.219
Rejected from foster home
after foster home.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.855
   What does that have to do
       with any of this?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.256
       Anger issues, too.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.859
Look,

13:47.861 --> 13:50.228
   My point is, it all paints
        a very sad story

13:50.230 --> 13:52.363
       Which should help
  garner sympathy from the da.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.266
I'm hoping i can talk them down
          to 30 years.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.268
           30 years?

13:57.270 --> 14:00.071
     If this goes to trail,
       you can get life.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.106
   You killed someone, peter.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.443
There's no getting around that.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.478
     It's part of you now.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.547
            Forever.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.184
            Hell...

14:13.186 --> 14:16.454
Some of the people locked up in
here actually take pride in it.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.391
             Me...

14:20.393 --> 14:22.627
  I couldn't live with myself.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.208
        (crowd chatter)

14:40.280 --> 14:42.347
      (indistinct chatter)

14:49.456 --> 14:51.923
                            Man:
             Mr. Prime minister,

14:51.925 --> 14:54.659
           You and your wife can
    follow me to the green room.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.224
    God, i hope this works.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.259
       (inhaling deeply)

15:28.261 --> 15:30.328
          (whooshing)

15:34.000 --> 15:36.067
(sighs)

15:39.139 --> 15:41.139
                          Woman:
                           Here.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.141
    It'll calm your nerves.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.676
(sighs)

15:44.678 --> 15:46.978
        You'll be fine.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.280
                Just don't throw
                up on the stage.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.281
          (both laugh)

15:50.283 --> 15:53.017
Nazari:
Ah, look at me.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.086
My first international summit,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.155
And i am a nervous wreck.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.359
  Have we done the right thing
          coming here?

16:01.361 --> 16:03.127
     Wanting a better life
        for your people

16:03.129 --> 16:05.029
   Is <i> always</i> the right thing.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.665
            You know
  what i'm up against, helen.

16:07.667 --> 16:12.203
The only reason i'm here
is to promote peace,

16:12.205 --> 16:15.974
While the warlords back home
are ready to start civil war.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.250
Everything is going to be fine.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.389
                 Breathe, abdul.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.157
I believe in you.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.225
            We all do.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.560
         (door opening)

16:40.600 --> 16:42.767
            (sighs)

16:42.769 --> 16:44.335
                            Man:
                          Hello?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.404
     (gasps loudly, coughs)
                            man:
                   Are you okay?

16:46.406 --> 16:47.605
(panting)

16:47.607 --> 16:50.208
      (panting continues)

16:50.210 --> 16:52.310
          Can't a girl
      power-nap in peace?

17:00.754 --> 17:02.520
     No, i think it's time
     we switch gears, rose.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.688
   I'm having serious doubts

17:03.690 --> 17:05.223
    About the prime minister
         being our guy.

17:05.224 --> 17:07.191
      Look, i'm gonna try
     to get to the senator

17:07.193 --> 17:08.358
Through a chief of staff, but...

17:08.361 --> 17:11.194
           In fact, there he is.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.263
          I got to go.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.367
          Mr. Beckett?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.435
A word. Vera buckley,
national deep space agency.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.805
I was hoping to get a meeting
with senator richards today.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.339
                        (laughs)
           you're joking, right?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.709
         She's about to start an
    international energy summit.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.278
       I know she's busy, but if
   anyone can get me two minutes

17:27.280 --> 17:28.445
      With her, it's you, right?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.248
            Look, it's about the
              new spending bill.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.682
     Which she already supports,
               unless you'd like

17:31.684 --> 17:34.052
      To keep bothering me until
     i make her change her mind.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.386
     (elevator bell dings)

17:35.388 --> 17:37.522
              If i could just...
Call the office.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.097
You got to admire her moxie.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.099
                        (sighs)

17:48.101 --> 17:51.502
          How many more of these
         favors do i have to do?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.237
   As many as i tell you to.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.640
I keep my promises.
You'll get what you want.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.342
  You know, i've been working
      in d.C. A long time.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.511
      You're not the first
 evil bastard i've dealt with.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.647
  Well, they all work for me.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.184
         And so do you,
       so finish the job.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.152
          I'm trying!

18:12.325 --> 18:14.492
          Try harder.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.366
        Are you stalking me now?

18:22.368 --> 18:23.768
What were you doing in there?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.336
           Getting a restraining
              order against you.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.871
Oh. Well,
what are the terms?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.339
I need to know
how far...

18:28.341 --> 18:30.274
              I need you to stop
             following me, okay?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.793
                I can't tell you
                what's going on.

18:31.794 --> 18:33.311
Then i can't tell you
about the license plate.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.179
         What-what did they say?
          What did you find out?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.181
You first.
            For god sakes, alan.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.584
You asked me to do you a favor,
which i gladly did,

18:39.586 --> 18:41.385
And now you want
to shut me out?

18:41.387 --> 18:43.387
That's not how it works.
             Okay, well, i don't
             have time for this,

18:43.389 --> 18:44.689
       So tell me what you found
           out, or i'm gonna go.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.491
Then go.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.559
                      All right.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.530
You never used
to keep secrets from me, v.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.301
      (indistinct chatter)

18:59.706 --> 19:02.306
Have you seen vera?
I lost track of her.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.275
                    No.
What's that?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.510
                     Our way in.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.445
        Congratulations. You are
        now an official employee

19:07.447 --> 19:10.481
               Of galveston oil,
           miss... Dottie frome.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.251
                What?

19:13.253 --> 19:15.520
        I'm an undercover agent.
              This is what i do.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.022
                        Come on.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.523
Raul, we are both
wanted by the law, okay?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.525
We need to be careful about
drawing attention to ourselves.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.631
             Yeah, we really do.
    Hmm.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.369
                           Look.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.703
There's the podium
where joshua saw himself.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.540
        And the crystal glasses.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.507
    <i> Just like he described.</i>

19:36.509 --> 19:37.675
       <i> This has got to be</i>

19:37.677 --> 19:38.910
                  The place from
                joshua's vision.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.444
Where are you going?

19:40.446 --> 19:42.513
                  Try and get in
            some people's heads.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.950
             Hope:
            <i> You said</i>

19:45.952 --> 19:47.518
Dad yelled at you
in a dream?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.687
         Said i've lost my mind,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.923
         Even god can't help me.

19:51.925 --> 19:53.925
        Ouch.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.927
    That hurts.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.796
Coming from the man
you idolized your whole life.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.932
It's tough

20:00.934 --> 20:03.201
To heal that deep a wound.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.572
God knows, it took me
years of therapy.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.640
                   Okay.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.511
       But what if i told you...

20:13.513 --> 20:15.880
             They're not dreams?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.550
          And i'm having them...

20:19.552 --> 20:21.285
        At all times of the day.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.753
       Even when i'm wide awake.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.757
            What if dad's right?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.728
                What if i really
              am losing my mind?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.466
      Are you using again?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.568
                    No.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.505
              I swear i'm clean.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.442
             Good.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.477
       That's good, josh.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.280
       I'm sorry for what i did.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.751
     For turning my back on you.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.557
        And i hope someday i can
          earn your forgiveness.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.295
    Coming here was a start.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.997
Listen,

21:05.999 --> 21:08.266
      You want to get rid
       of all this pain?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.601
   Push dad out of your mind.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.004
Don't let his
cruel words

21:13.006 --> 21:15.306
         Distract you.
 You need to focus less on him

21:15.308 --> 21:16.707
     And more on yourself.

21:19.979 --> 21:24.048
          Joshua sr.:
    You have lost your mind!
    Even god can't help you.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.587
             Oh, god, that's it.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.822
                    I got to go.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.026
          Uh, but before i do...

21:37.497 --> 21:40.064
    ...Will you let me know when
    caleb's next t-ball game is?

21:41.668 --> 21:43.668
   'cause i'd really love to go.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.909
            The man:
   <i> You killed someone, peter.</i>

21:51.911 --> 21:53.978
<i>It's part of you, now, forever.</i>

21:55.715 --> 21:58.783
         <i> Me, i couldn't</i>
       <i> live with myself.</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:22.640
                   I thought you
                were happy here.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.011
       Why would you try
       to kill yourself?

22:28.781 --> 22:31.782
They're taking me away
because you lost your job.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.518
                         No. I'm
                     sorry, bud,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.520
    But when a foster child
   does something like this,

22:36.522 --> 22:37.822
     We're required by law

22:37.824 --> 22:40.091
    To tell family services.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.426
                  It's the last
                 thing we want--

22:42.428 --> 22:43.728
      We love you, peter.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.430
 I know you're in a dark place

22:46.432 --> 22:48.099
                      Right now.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.967
One day, you'll find the light.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.669
                      And you're
                        gonna do

22:51.671 --> 22:53.537
       All kinds of good.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.746
  (men speaking indistinctly
          in distance)

23:25.037 --> 23:27.104
  (men speaking indistinctly
          in distance)

23:32.011 --> 23:33.778
                          Guard:
                    Peter moore.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.651
      You have a visitor.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.086
           <i> (buzzing)</i>

23:50.663 --> 23:51.962
        What are you doing here?

23:51.964 --> 23:54.665
     I'm bringing you home.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.569
Raul. Hey.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.870
You hear anything?

23:59.872 --> 24:01.572
                 Nothing useful.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.507
Guess we'll never know where
the clues'll be hidden.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.811
Come on, erin. God's not testing
       us, he's messing with us.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.713
       Well, i'm gonna go
  talk to that guy over there.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.916
        See if i can get
      any info out of him.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.018
            Why him?
He's the only one

24:14.020 --> 24:16.520
Not wearing a wedding ring.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.889
  You're not the only one that
  can get into people's heads.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.862
Hi there.
            Hello...

24:24.864 --> 24:25.996
           Ms. Frome.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.132
  Oh, please, call me dottie.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.800
     Up from galveston, are you?
I am.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.803
  Proud to be a part of this.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.872
    Lots of security, i see.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.040
        Very comforting.
                       Oh, yeah.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.542
       Anything happens,
      we got you covered.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.044
   State police, austin pd...

24:40.046 --> 24:41.745
            And us.

24:41.747 --> 24:42.880
          Who's "us"?
               Senator richards'

24:42.882 --> 24:44.248
     Private security team.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.917
       Private security?
    Wow, that's impressive.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.220
How'd you get
such an important job?

24:49.222 --> 24:50.888
     Well, we're all vets.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.089
                Senator richards
                           has a

24:52.091 --> 24:54.158
    Foundation. Helps place
       returning soldiers

24:54.160 --> 24:55.860
       In jobs back home.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.862
         That's great.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.864
          That woman is a saint.

24:59.866 --> 25:00.931
        Don't know where
      i'd be without her.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.067
             Rose:
             <i> Peter,</i>

25:03.069 --> 25:05.803
  You have to get out of here.
   Joshua had another vision.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.805
        He saw two arms
       breaking shackles.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.507
     That's you, i know it.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.709
    Look, rose, i'm in here
    for 30 years, at least.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.110
       Who told you that?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.745
          My attorney.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.982
     Well, what's his name?
     I want to talk to him.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.684
         I don't know.
       He didn't tell me.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.988
        Just that i should plead
     guilty and be done with it.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.856
   He actually told you that?

25:25.858 --> 25:27.825
   He said i killed someone.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.693
          Now it's a part of me.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.862
            Forever.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.731
                      He said if
                    he did that,

25:33.733 --> 25:36.767
          He wouldn't be able to
              live with himself.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.836
     What did he look like?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.771
   Dark hair, with an accent?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.907
           Yeah. Why?

25:42.909 --> 25:45.109
      Listen to me, peter.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.311
I think that man was the devil.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.913
You may be
the strongest

25:48.915 --> 25:50.748
 Of the messengers, physically,

25:50.750 --> 25:52.783
        But emotionally,
     he thinks you're weak.

25:52.785 --> 25:56.186
So he's trying to exploit that,
    take you out of action.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.889
But you're a lot
stronger than he thinks.

26:00.293 --> 26:03.894
I know things seem
hopeless right now.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.630
You feel
alone, lost,

26:06.632 --> 26:09.099
           Abandoned.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.969
       But i promise you,
       you're not alone.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.139
     You're part of a very
        important family

26:15.141 --> 26:18.976
Now, and we will
never, ever abandon you.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.978
             Yeah.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.846
    I've heard that before.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.115
                   Guard: Moore.
     (buzzing, door opens)

26:25.117 --> 26:27.885
                Let's go. You're

26:27.887 --> 26:29.954
                    Heading back
                    to arkansas.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.598
          (door shuts)

26:40.600 --> 26:43.167
I'm starting to think that maybe
the senator isn't the horseman,

26:43.169 --> 26:46.003
I mean, she seems like
a legitimately good person.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.005
    That's what people say about
  the neighbor when he turns out

26:48.007 --> 26:50.007
          To be a serial killer.
       Look, he's right.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.109
    You know, the fact is we
  don't have evidence against

26:52.111 --> 26:53.611
          The senator
     or the prime minister.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.179
    It's all just suspicion.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.214
                  Maybe it's not
               one person dying.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.683
    If you think about what josh
       has seen in the visions--

26:59.685 --> 27:03.387
        The dead bodies,
    blood-spattered glass--

27:03.389 --> 27:06.790
     What if it's some kind
    of a bomb or something?

27:06.792 --> 27:09.159
             All of the security
        checking people in, they
    would have caught it by now.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.028
Not if the bomb
was planted ahead of time.
       It's not a bombing

27:11.030 --> 27:12.863
  I think it's an assassination.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.898
   Now, i saw the vision more
   clearly-- a single bullet

27:14.900 --> 27:16.700
Pulled from my chest.
Now what if that

27:16.702 --> 27:17.935
      Means that somebody
   up on that podium tonight

27:17.937 --> 27:19.870
       Is gonna get shot?

27:19.871 --> 27:21.804
     Well, there's only one
   problem with that theory.
The senator

27:21.807 --> 27:23.941
     And the prime minister
  will both be standing there.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.710
     And if neither of them
      are the horseman...

27:28.314 --> 27:29.980
          Then who is?

27:50.703 --> 27:52.770
   (horn honking in distance)

27:56.942 --> 27:58.308
   Look, just leave me alo...

27:58.310 --> 27:59.977
            (grunts)
              oh!

27:59.979 --> 28:01.679
      (honking continues)

28:01.681 --> 28:03.113
            Aah! Oh.

28:19.965 --> 28:21.165
        (tires screech)

28:35.381 --> 28:36.814
             Peter.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.083
We have to go,

28:39.085 --> 28:40.451
              Now.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.415
              Man:
             <i> What?</i>

29:11.417 --> 29:13.383
              You... You can't
               back out now,

29:13.385 --> 29:16.053
           This was your idea
          in the first place.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.455
         We worked our asses off
             to put it together.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.391
 I just want to make sure that
 we've considered every option.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.362
       We have. We have.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.431
 We take out this prime minister

29:27.433 --> 29:30.834
     Right here, right now,
   in this very public forum

29:30.836 --> 29:34.204
       And his country collapses
                 into civil war.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.507
     It is the quickest way
   to insure a u.S. Invasion.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.375
 Now isn't that what you want?
If i have

29:38.377 --> 29:41.445
  This man killed, thousands,
   if not millions, will die.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.180
  You... You said it yourself:

29:43.182 --> 29:45.382
We should have finished that war
     the first time around.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.152
                  Small price to
                pay for the life

29:48.154 --> 29:49.553
          Of your son.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.123
         You're really gonna let
       jimmy's death be in vain?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.358
                    Vera:
             Look, you can't-you
               can't listen...

29:54.360 --> 29:56.226
   You cannot listen to him.
                    Everything's

29:56.228 --> 29:58.095
                In place, you're
                  good to go.

29:58.097 --> 30:01.131
      Soon as you pick up
      the glass to drink,

30:01.133 --> 30:02.866
       He takes the shot.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.339
             Hey, there you are.
               I've been looking
               for you all over.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.108
     I was spirit walking,
   and i think i figured out

30:11.110 --> 30:12.843
   How our gifts work, okay?
   It has to do with urgency.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.211
And what i just saw was
as urgent as it gets.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.512
                    What was it?
        Senator richards

30:15.514 --> 30:17.214
         Is gonna have
the prime minister assassinated

30:17.216 --> 30:19.917
       In order to avenge
her son's death and start a war.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.151
               Well, that's it--
            that must be the sin

30:21.153 --> 30:22.419
             That turns her into
            the horseman, right?

30:22.421 --> 30:24.221
      So all of the bodies
    that joshua saw were...

30:24.223 --> 30:26.156
             Casualties of a war
           she's about to start.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.925
         Look, we have
      to stop the senator

30:27.927 --> 30:30.961
 From raising her glass, okay?
   That's the shooter's cue.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.196
          (door opens)

30:32.198 --> 30:35.365
           (applause)

30:35.367 --> 30:37.201
          The summit's starting.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.037
      But who's the assassin?

30:40.039 --> 30:43.473
He is a symbol of hope,
not only for his country,

30:43.475 --> 30:45.943
But for the entire world.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.178
His is a voice
of peace

30:48.180 --> 30:50.180
   (eerie, indistinct voices)
and reconciliation,

30:50.182 --> 30:52.583
A voice that
must be heeded now

30:52.585 --> 30:54.218
                 More than ever.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.221
                Because in these
                troubling times,

30:57.223 --> 31:01.425
        People like abdul nazari
            seem harder to find.

31:01.427 --> 31:05.128
            People with the will
       and strength of character

31:05.130 --> 31:08.365
            To stand up to those
           who would wage war...

31:08.367 --> 31:09.433
                       (gasps)

31:09.435 --> 31:11.168
          Hello again.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.037
      Come with me.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.905
    Why? Is something wrong?
Yeah.
Dottie frome

31:14.907 --> 31:17.875
        Just checked in,
and she's missing her name tag.

31:17.877 --> 31:20.143
 Falcon 1, i have a situation.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.612
           (quietly):
            Falcon.

31:21.614 --> 31:23.180
           That's it.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.482
   (eerie, indistinct voices)

31:25.484 --> 31:27.317
             Erin:
           <i> Hey, raul!</i>

31:27.319 --> 31:29.987
             Erin:
    <i> Please, can you hear me?</i>

31:29.989 --> 31:31.121
            (sighs)

31:31.123 --> 31:33.390
   <i> Falcon-- from the vision.</i>

31:33.392 --> 31:35.058
          <i> It's someone</i>
     <i> on the security team.</i>

31:35.060 --> 31:37.294
   <i> He could be the shooter. </i>
            Falcon.

31:39.298 --> 31:42.532
 ...And strengthening the bond
   between our two countries.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.601
           (applause)
                   yes.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.538
                      Let's hope

31:48.540 --> 31:50.207
This bond
will continue

31:50.209 --> 31:52.109
      Far into the future.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.144
           (applause)

32:05.658 --> 32:07.591
        (loud rumbling)

32:17.503 --> 32:19.202
           (gunshot)

32:19.204 --> 32:20.137
          (screaming)

32:20.139 --> 32:23.273
              ¶ ¶

32:31.083 --> 32:33.650
  What the hell just happened?

32:33.652 --> 32:35.385
 The first seal's been broken.

32:45.731 --> 32:49.099
             Erin:
   But it doesn't make sense.
 We stopped the assassination,

32:49.101 --> 32:52.102
So why didn't that stop
the senator from becoming
the first horseman?

32:52.104 --> 32:54.738
   Because she still made the
 decision to pick up that glass

32:54.740 --> 32:57.307
   And have the shot fired--
       that was her sin.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.644
      Okay. So now we know
         she's the one.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.980
      Let's go after her.
                       We can't.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.749
  Once a horseman breaks their
 seal, there's no reversing it.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.684
Seriously? That's it?
               All we can do now

33:07.686 --> 33:09.987
Is find the next horseman
   and try to stop him.

33:09.989 --> 33:13.156
 I should've come back sooner.
       No, it's my fault.
        I should've seen

33:13.158 --> 33:16.593
             The vision clearer.
     You did something good
    with your gift tonight.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.763
               I know it may not
                   feel like it,

33:19.765 --> 33:21.698
        But there's a lot we did
            right tonight, guys.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.667
      Starting with saving
         a man's life.
              Not just his life,

33:23.669 --> 33:26.503
But thousands of his countrymen.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.339
          We've really
    worked together tonight.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.574
          She's right.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.343
        We can do this.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.412
          (door opens)

33:45.691 --> 33:48.091
 Alan, you're lucky i love you,

33:48.093 --> 33:50.260
     'cause you are getting
       on my last nerve.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.696
          There was an attempted
           assassination tonight
                      in austin.

33:52.698 --> 33:53.797
                 You were there.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.599
           This isn't a game, v.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.801
            You could have died.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.037
                Again. So enough

34:00.039 --> 34:02.372
              With the secrets--
               i deserve better.

34:15.687 --> 34:19.556
      Do you remember when
 you asked me who michael was?

34:21.260 --> 34:23.693
          He's my son.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.697
    He was taken from me...

34:28.699 --> 34:31.134
        Seven years ago.

34:31.136 --> 34:33.203
           Kidnapped.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.841
But i believe that these people
     can help me find him.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.179
        I also need you.

34:42.181 --> 34:46.750
   I need you to help me find
that missing meteor, because...

34:46.752 --> 34:50.120
          I think it's
   somehow connected to this.

34:50.121 --> 34:53.857
    ¶ i'm gonna be okay... ¶

34:53.859 --> 34:56.793
              The license plates
            are u.S. Government.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.130
         The van could be at any
        number of installations.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.666
             My cousin's working
          on narrowing the list.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.302
         Thanks.

35:09.141 --> 35:12.342
               I just don't want
            to see you get hurt.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.895
                I mean...

35:14.896 --> 35:17.447
     Because, believe it or not,
 beneath these rugged good looks

35:17.449 --> 35:18.748
           Is just a regular guy

35:18.750 --> 35:22.319
             That actually cares
                a lot about you.

35:22.321 --> 35:25.789
 (laughs): Yeah, 'cause i would
  definitely call you rugged.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.357
       Well, in a certain light.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.860
                Or lack thereof.
(sniffles, laughs)

35:29.862 --> 35:33.163
          Mm. Come on,
      i'll buy you a beer.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.532
Now, that's being a good friend.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.902
         ¶ i believe ¶

35:38.904 --> 35:41.404
      ¶ in something now ¶

35:44.843 --> 35:48.912
 ¶ i will find my way somehow ¶

35:52.885 --> 35:56.253
     ¶ a taste for living ¶

35:56.255 --> 36:00.323
     ¶ a new beginning... ¶
         (line ringing)

36:00.325 --> 36:03.160
             Hello?
        Hey. Mr. Cooper.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.829
              Dad.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.531
      Peter, is that you?

36:07.533 --> 36:09.933
       How are you, son?
           I'm okay.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.404
  I just wanted to call and...

36:15.807 --> 36:18.241
       ...Say thank you.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.911
        You said one day
      i'd find the light.

36:20.913 --> 36:23.747
        You were right.

36:23.749 --> 36:27.217
     ¶ i'm gonna be okay ¶

36:28.420 --> 36:31.955
          What is it?
                      Over here.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.958
    ¶ i'm gonna be okay... ¶

36:44.570 --> 36:46.937
That's you.

36:46.939 --> 36:50.207
            You just turned two.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.295
             Raul:
I'm sorry for everything, nadia.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.564
            You lost a father...

37:17.703 --> 37:19.769
      ...While i lost a brother.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.841
               Um, we still have
                     each other.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.679
           (sniffles)

37:36.989 --> 37:39.289
                      Everything
                     cleaned up?
   The entire security team's

37:39.291 --> 37:42.425
Been taken care of--
no one will be doing
any whistle-blowing.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.561
                       Good.
Want some more good news?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.663
                         Hm?
      The president wants
        to talk to you.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.031
   Apparently, you're a hero.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.033
       The way the press
        have been going,

37:50.035 --> 37:51.901
People actually think you
saved the prime minister

37:51.903 --> 37:53.770
By taking
a bullet for him.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.274
It just bumped you
up the short list for
secretary of defense.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.509
Your power just
reached a new level.

37:59.511 --> 38:02.345
         Now i'm gonna bring the
       whole world to its knees.
So i guess

38:02.347 --> 38:04.981
You'll need someone to fill
that seat in the senate?

38:04.983 --> 38:07.517
          Don't worry, i'm gonna
             do everything i can

38:07.519 --> 38:10.287
               To make sure that
                 someone is you.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.990
         (bird cawing)

38:13.992 --> 38:16.960
            (sighs)
          meantime...

38:16.962 --> 38:19.896
There's just
one more loose end
that needs tying up.

38:26.038 --> 38:28.505
   You'll clean up this mess?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.943
          Absolutely.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.812
             Good.

   Newswoman (over computer):
     Afghan prime minister
   abdul nazari returned home

39:14.353 --> 39:16.419
     To a heroic reception
         this morning.

39:16.421 --> 39:19.122
The faithful believe the botched
     assassination attempt

39:19.124 --> 39:21.691
           Was an act
    of divine intervention.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.094
 As a result, warring factions
       within the country

39:24.096 --> 39:26.596
      Have finally agreed
       to discuss peace.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.932
     This will pave the way
     for greater stability,

39:28.934 --> 39:31.134
        Not only within
      the trouble region,

39:31.136 --> 39:33.470
 But also throughout the world.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.138
      Local news is next.

     Newsman: Thanks, jan.
