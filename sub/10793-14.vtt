WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.514
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.756 --> 00:06.700
We are going to survive.

00:06.701 --> 00:09.642
We are going to make it home.

00:10.044 --> 00:13.705
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason.

00:13.706 --> 00:16.352
This ship is powered
by the stars themselves.

00:17.056 --> 00:18.866
He and Young are bumping heads, yes.

00:19.671 --> 00:22.318
Not sure which camp is
the better choice.

00:22.319 --> 00:23.592
We just pretend nothing happened.

00:23.593 --> 00:26.441
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

00:26.442 --> 00:27.916
For the sake of the crew.

00:27.917 --> 00:31.367
For the sake of the crew.

00:31.368 --> 00:33.613
I want to see the alien ship.

00:33.614 --> 00:35.021
Were you just trying to distract me?

00:35.022 --> 00:37.066
So that I wouldn't notice
what Rush was doing?

00:37.067 --> 00:40.183
Look, I knew it was coming,
but I didn't know when.

00:40.184 --> 00:42.563
Navigation, propulsion and many others

00:42.564 --> 00:44.808
have been locked out
entirely by a master code,

00:44.809 --> 00:47.021
which we have had no luck in breaking.

00:47.022 --> 00:50.607
An Ancient device like this is
pretty much a death sentence.

00:50.608 --> 00:51.746
I'm not stopping you, Rush.

00:51.747 --> 00:54.596
Go, sit, be my guest.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.157 --> 01:43.295
Have you seen my glasses?

01:44.905 --> 01:47.184
Bread box.

01:51.039 --> 01:53.049
You're up early.

01:53.050 --> 01:55.261
Am I?

01:55.262 --> 01:57.038
I thought you'd sleep in.

01:57.039 --> 01:57.976
I've got things to do.

01:57.977 --> 01:59.350
4:00?

01:59.351 --> 02:00.959
What?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.266
Dr. Browning.

02:02.267 --> 02:04.880
Oh, yeah, that's today, right.

02:23.148 --> 02:24.353
Listen, I...

02:24.354 --> 02:26.399
I won't be able to make it today.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.505
Nicholas...

02:27.506 --> 02:29.114
Nothing to worry about.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.539
Okay, who can tell me the
significance of Shor's algorithm?

03:04.540 --> 03:09.148
It's a quantum algorithm used
for integer factorization.

03:09.149 --> 03:12.119
It's important because
it can, in theory,

03:12.120 --> 03:13.488
be used to "break" the widely used

03:13.489 --> 03:16.494
public-key cryptography
scheme known as RSA.

03:16.495 --> 03:19.533
RSA is based on the assumption

03:19.534 --> 03:20.968
that factoring large numbers

03:20.969 --> 03:23.572
is computationally infeasible.

03:23.573 --> 03:26.477
This assumption is valid
for classical computers.

03:26.478 --> 03:27.714
No classical algorithm is known

03:27.715 --> 03:31.622
that can factor in polynomial time.

03:37.965 --> 03:39.232
Professor Rush?

03:40.569 --> 03:41.571
Yeah.

03:41.572 --> 03:42.673
Very good.

03:44.543 --> 03:46.412
Nicholas!

03:46.413 --> 03:48.650
Nicholas?

03:48.651 --> 03:49.785
What are you doing here?

03:49.786 --> 03:51.054
I'm sorry, Constance, not now.

03:51.055 --> 03:53.525
I thought you were taking
Gloria to the oncologist today.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.061
She wanted to go by herself.

03:55.062 --> 03:56.130
That doesn't sound like her.

03:56.131 --> 03:57.231
Are you sure she really meant it?

03:57.232 --> 03:58.433
Oh, yes, quite sure.

03:58.434 --> 03:59.736
Nick, what's wrong with you?

03:59.737 --> 04:01.071
I thought you'd be worried sick.

04:01.072 --> 04:03.476
I am. Very concerned.

04:22.676 --> 04:23.844
Yes?

04:25.215 --> 04:26.282
It's back.

04:27.818 --> 04:28.920
I had a feeling.

04:28.921 --> 04:31.156
You did? You...

04:31.157 --> 04:32.292
You never said so.

04:32.293 --> 04:34.262
No.

04:38.337 --> 04:39.705
I can't go through this again.

04:39.706 --> 04:42.143
I can't.

04:42.144 --> 04:45.048
Nick?

04:45.049 --> 04:45.982
Nick, are you there?

04:45.983 --> 04:47.051
Yes, yes.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.091
Are you coming home?

04:59.674 --> 05:00.775
Nick...

05:02.379 --> 05:04.114
Yes, soon, soon.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.178
Professor Rush?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.816
Professor Rush...

06:21.817 --> 06:23.152
Hi, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson.

06:23.153 --> 06:24.353
So you are.

06:24.354 --> 06:25.823
I'm sorry to accost you here.

06:25.824 --> 06:26.925
I dropped by your office,
and they told me

06:26.926 --> 06:28.061
that you hadn't come in for the day.

06:28.062 --> 06:29.462
Do you know, I really
don't have time for this.

06:29.463 --> 06:31.666
Actually, I think you're going to
want to hear what I have to say.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.002
Is there someplace more
private we could talk?

06:33.003 --> 06:35.272
You're going to tell me
about the Stargate program.

06:35.273 --> 06:37.344
Your current dilemma...

06:37.345 --> 06:41.551
How to unlock the Stargate's
ninth and final chevron.

06:41.552 --> 06:43.187
Specifically,

06:43.188 --> 06:45.792
how much energy will be required.

06:45.892 --> 06:47.094
How do you know that?

06:47.095 --> 06:48.229
Those details are highly classified.

06:48.230 --> 06:51.267
The project hasn't even
been named yet, has it?

06:51.268 --> 06:53.037
How about "Icarus"?

06:55.977 --> 06:57.378
I know because it's already happened...

06:59.149 --> 07:02.453
And you're just a
figment of my imagination.

07:02.454 --> 07:05.458
Reliving all of this is
just a necessary evil,

07:05.459 --> 07:07.396
an unfortunate side effect

07:07.397 --> 07:08.797
to a process I can't control,

07:08.798 --> 07:10.534
and it keeps getting in the bloody way

07:10.535 --> 07:12.438
of what I need to do.

07:12.439 --> 07:13.673
You,

07:13.674 --> 07:14.908
the university,

07:14.909 --> 07:16.144
the clouds in the sky,

07:16.145 --> 07:18.380
all just a dream,

07:18.381 --> 07:20.419
a distant memory,

07:20.420 --> 07:23.423
and one I'd really rather went away.

07:33.108 --> 07:36.045
What the hell's going on?

07:43.766 --> 07:45.601
His pulse is strong.

07:45.602 --> 07:47.871
BP's elevated, but not dramatically.

07:47.872 --> 07:49.275
He didn't want to involve anyone else.

07:49.276 --> 07:52.145
I am in command of this
ship, and that means

07:52.146 --> 07:54.315
you don't do anything
without involving me.

07:54.316 --> 07:55.518
Do you understand?

07:56.821 --> 07:58.423
What is all this?

07:58.424 --> 08:00.293
We modified the interface.

08:00.294 --> 08:02.529
We were hoping it would
allow us to use the chair

08:02.530 --> 08:03.665
without causing damage to the subject...

08:03.666 --> 08:04.667
And?

08:04.668 --> 08:07.472
Rush is the first subject.

08:07.473 --> 08:08.707
Let's wake him up.

08:08.708 --> 08:09.675
I can't.

08:10.845 --> 08:12.881
Severing the connection
externally could be very dangerous.

08:12.882 --> 08:13.883
He has to do it himself.

08:16.722 --> 08:18.858
Look, with or without me,
Rush still would've done it.

08:18.859 --> 08:19.843
Even after what happened to Franklin?

08:19.937 --> 08:22.531
This is the only way to
unlock control of the ship.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.737
The code has to be in
the databank somewhere.

08:25.738 --> 08:26.972
Let's forget about Rush for a second.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.375
If he wants to kill himself, so be it.

08:28.376 --> 08:30.579
How do you know this
modification you've made

08:30.580 --> 08:33.383
is not going to backfire put
the whole ship in jeopardy?

08:33.384 --> 08:34.919
I don't.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.258
How does this new interface work?

08:37.259 --> 08:40.730
We created a buffer to slow
down the transfer of information.

08:40.731 --> 08:44.302
We also limited the
connection to a narrow range

08:44.303 --> 08:45.404
of the subject's subconscious.

08:45.405 --> 08:46.706
That should protect

08:46.707 --> 08:48.443
the vast majority of his brain.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.949
In a worst case, we hope only the
memories that we targeted could be lost.

08:51.950 --> 08:54.588
And if it works, the data
stored in the ship's computer

08:54.589 --> 08:58.594
should be made available
to Rush through a dream.

08:58.595 --> 08:59.696
A dream?

08:59.697 --> 09:01.532
A semi-lucid one.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.871
Sort of a stimulated recall
of the memories in question.

09:03.872 --> 09:06.408
How does he wake up?

09:06.409 --> 09:07.710
There's a built-in trigger.

09:07.711 --> 09:09.647
It should appear to him
as a distinctive door.

09:09.648 --> 09:11.417
All he has to do is
open it and walk through.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.722
He seems stable for now.

09:14.723 --> 09:17.493
Okay, let's say this is working.

09:17.494 --> 09:18.862
Do you have any feedback?

09:18.863 --> 09:19.731
Do you know what Rush is
actually doing in there?

09:19.732 --> 09:21.033
No.

09:21.034 --> 09:23.603
Anything goes wrong,
I'm pulling the plug.

09:32.620 --> 09:33.688
Get on a plane.

09:33.689 --> 09:34.725
Go.

09:34.726 --> 09:36.693
I don't want to go alone.

09:36.694 --> 09:37.695
I'll go with you.

09:37.696 --> 09:38.697
Thank you.

09:40.034 --> 09:41.802
The truth is, as much as I'd like to...

09:42.872 --> 09:47.579
I don't think I have the strength.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.767
Nicholas?

09:59.768 --> 10:01.670
My God, Nick...

10:01.671 --> 10:02.973
Don't worry.

10:02.974 --> 10:04.375
I haven't lost my mind, not yet, anyway,

10:04.376 --> 10:07.415
but as you can see, I am rather busy.

10:07.416 --> 10:10.920
Ignoring it isn't helping anyone.

10:10.921 --> 10:12.456
Burying yourself in work this way.

10:12.457 --> 10:14.059
She needs you...

10:14.060 --> 10:15.094
You know, thank you for your concern,

10:15.095 --> 10:16.496
but, you know,

10:16.497 --> 10:18.500
I really cannot deal with any
distractions at the moment...

10:18.501 --> 10:20.738
Is that what your dying wife
is to you, a distraction?

10:20.739 --> 10:22.541
No, no, no, of course not.

10:22.542 --> 10:24.945
She wants to go home one last time.

10:24.946 --> 10:25.946
You should take her.

10:25.947 --> 10:28.751
Constance...

10:28.752 --> 10:33.560
I know you mean well, I really do.

10:33.561 --> 10:38.134
But I can't go anywhere, not now.

10:57.169 --> 10:58.603
Hey.

10:58.604 --> 11:02.009
Hey.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.914
Are we okay?

11:04.915 --> 11:06.250
Sure.

11:06.251 --> 11:07.952
Why not?

11:07.953 --> 11:12.126
You chose to sit here by
yourself instead of with me.

11:12.127 --> 11:13.930
You looked busy.

11:18.907 --> 11:21.209
I need to know that
we're going to be okay.

11:23.848 --> 11:27.052
I know you think that I
betrayed you, and I'm sorry.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.956
I never meant to hurt you.

11:28.957 --> 11:32.195
It will never happen again.

11:32.196 --> 11:34.332
Your friendship means too much to me.

11:44.150 --> 11:45.285
Never a dull moment.

11:46.821 --> 11:48.924
Shall we see where we are now?

11:52.764 --> 11:53.865
What do we got?

11:53.866 --> 11:55.970
Take a look.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.110
Are those buildings?

12:00.111 --> 12:01.179
Were.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.783
They look like ruins.

12:03.784 --> 12:05.853
It's the first sign of
civilization on a planet out here.

12:05.854 --> 12:06.855
Human?

12:06.856 --> 12:07.924
No signs of any life.

12:07.925 --> 12:10.395
We should go check it out.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.897
Six hours on the clock.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.266
You guys gear up.

12:14.804 --> 12:15.871
I'd like to go.

12:15.872 --> 12:16.906
Me too.

12:19.846 --> 12:22.315
Chloe has been studying
all of Dr. Jackson's work.

12:22.316 --> 12:23.685
Really?

12:23.686 --> 12:24.686
You have?

12:24.687 --> 12:25.989
I have.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.057
Say something archaeological.

12:27.058 --> 12:28.159
Stratification.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.728
- That's good.
- Thank you.

12:29.729 --> 12:31.999
Plus, didn't you say
you took Ancient history?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.869
- I did.
- At Harvard.

12:33.870 --> 12:35.304
Well, I don't see how that helps us

12:35.305 --> 12:37.275
billions of light-years
from Earth, but I get it.

12:37.276 --> 12:38.911
I'm pretty sure we've established

12:38.912 --> 12:41.115
that this ship is no
safer than any planet.

12:41.116 --> 12:42.918
Kidnapped by aliens, right here.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.789
I don't have a problem
with either of you going.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.191
I never said I did.

12:47.695 --> 12:49.763
Just be careful.

12:49.764 --> 12:52.301
Yes, sir.

12:56.342 --> 13:00.215
Every code that's ever been cracked,

13:00.216 --> 13:03.287
every cipher in the last two millennia

13:03.288 --> 13:06.726
has been based on those
that came before them.

13:06.727 --> 13:09.331
This code, however, is so old

13:09.332 --> 13:11.201
there may be no known predecessor.

13:11.202 --> 13:13.004
You're talking about a proto-encryption?

13:13.005 --> 13:14.206
Exactly. Right.

13:14.207 --> 13:17.746
Well... how do we attack
it with no basis, then?

13:19.816 --> 13:23.489
None of you?

13:23.490 --> 13:24.659
Nothing?

13:24.759 --> 13:27.897
No of you see any pattern in this?

13:29.166 --> 13:30.434
So, what good are you lot, then?

13:30.435 --> 13:32.838
Why are you here?

13:32.839 --> 13:35.042
There are symbols up there
I've never even seen before...

13:35.043 --> 13:36.477
Yes, you have!

13:36.478 --> 13:38.783
Yes, you have, because I
have, and you are all me!

13:44.860 --> 13:46.028
Get out!

13:46.029 --> 13:47.764
All of you just get out!

13:56.080 --> 13:58.817
It's not their fault.

14:02.725 --> 14:05.162
Yeah, I know.

14:05.163 --> 14:08.935
I'm the one who can't solve it.

14:08.936 --> 14:10.904
Despite the fact it's
right in front of me.

14:10.905 --> 14:13.844
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

14:13.845 --> 14:16.414
Oh, yeah...

14:16.415 --> 14:17.851
I'm going to fail at that, too.

14:17.852 --> 14:19.319
I'm sorry?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.891
Solving the issues of
dialing the ninth chevron.

14:21.892 --> 14:25.364
I'll devote two and a half
years of my life to that.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.533
Meanwhile, my wife...

14:27.534 --> 14:32.075
is going to spend her dying
days alone while I'm off, out,

14:32.076 --> 14:33.444
trying to solve that little problem...

14:36.284 --> 14:39.989
and then some kid, some big child

14:39.990 --> 14:42.360
with no meaningful education

14:42.361 --> 14:44.530
is going to jump
in at the last moment...

14:44.531 --> 14:48.403
And solve it, just like that.

14:48.404 --> 14:51.241
No sense of ambition.

14:51.242 --> 14:54.547
He spends most of his time
playing ridiculous games,

14:54.548 --> 14:59.022
yet he's the genius I'll never be.

14:59.023 --> 15:04.899
He's the one who should be here
now, seeing what I'm seeing.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.269
Look...

15:07.270 --> 15:10.976
Obviously you're not yourself right now.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.578
I do understand what it
is you're going through.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.315
Yeah, I know.

15:14.316 --> 15:17.520
I lost my wife, and there was
nothing I could do to save her.

15:17.521 --> 15:21.594
It's a terrible, helpless feeling.

15:25.936 --> 15:28.940
Yeah, my wife's not the answer.

15:28.941 --> 15:31.111
Data does come quicker
when I'm with her,

15:31.112 --> 15:35.987
but quicker's not going to
help me if I can't interpret it.

15:35.988 --> 15:38.323
There's patterns I'm just not seeing.

15:38.324 --> 15:41.162
I'm just saying if you need
time, take it, be with her.

15:41.163 --> 15:43.399
That's more important right now.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.006
That's more important than anything.

15:47.007 --> 15:48.241
Yeah, thanks,
you've been really helpful.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.521
Your nose is bleeding.

16:09.898 --> 16:12.736
The kino really couldn't
do this place justice.

16:12.737 --> 16:14.640
It's pretty incredible.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.774
Awesome.

16:22.287 --> 16:26.960
It doesn't look like anybody's
been here for a long, long time.

16:26.961 --> 16:31.035
Well, we have about six hours
to figure out what happened.

16:31.036 --> 16:33.204
Let's look around.

16:39.550 --> 16:41.687
Progress?

16:41.688 --> 16:43.789
His nose was bleeding. It's stopped now.

16:43.790 --> 16:45.760
What does that mean?

16:45.761 --> 16:48.097
I don't know exactly, but
it can't be good for him,

16:48.098 --> 16:49.467
the way this thing messes
with the brain.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.104
His heart rate and BP
have been fluctuating.

16:52.105 --> 16:53.139
You said he was stable.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.875
I said, "for the moment."

16:54.876 --> 16:57.280
That was over an hour ago.

16:57.781 --> 17:01.821
No way at all to tell if
he's having any success?

17:01.822 --> 17:04.291
No, all I'm able to monitor is the
rate the data's flowing into his mind,

17:04.292 --> 17:05.828
and that's been fluctuating as well.

17:05.829 --> 17:10.203
What are the odds that yanking
him out of there will kill him?

17:12.006 --> 17:14.275
I wouldn't even hazard a guess.

17:23.192 --> 17:28.000
I've spent most of the last
20 years watching what I ate,

17:28.001 --> 17:34.345
denying myself the things
I most loved, and now,

17:34.346 --> 17:37.516
I could eat anything I want,
and nothing seems appealing.

17:38.586 --> 17:39.820
Yeah.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.333
Why are you here, Nick?

17:48.537 --> 17:50.306
Because this is what happened.

17:54.213 --> 17:55.949
You have work to do. Go and do it.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.086
I am doing it.

17:58.087 --> 17:59.554
It doesn't seem to matter where I am.

17:59.555 --> 18:04.430
You have the chance to
change so many things.

18:04.431 --> 18:09.038
The one thing you can't change
is what's happening to me.

18:10.976 --> 18:14.080
Don't let that hold you back.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.581
When the time comes,
I know you'll be there.

18:51.279 --> 18:53.850
Okay, every time I turn,
I see another wall...

18:53.851 --> 18:55.853
So what do you think that means?

18:55.854 --> 18:59.025
What do you got, buddy?

18:59.026 --> 19:00.427
Well, it's pretty cool.

19:00.428 --> 19:03.833
Looks like a network
of underground tunnels.

19:03.834 --> 19:04.969
We should check it out.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.838
Why?

19:06.839 --> 19:08.141
Don't you want to know
who once lived here?

19:08.142 --> 19:10.045
How does that help us?

19:11.448 --> 19:13.551
Hey, so far Destiny has
stopped on planets

19:13.552 --> 19:15.520
that had something
on them that we needed.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.324
I'm not saying it's always
going to be the case, but...

19:17.325 --> 19:18.959
Did you see anything on the kino?

19:18.960 --> 19:21.964
No, but we...

19:21.965 --> 19:24.537
What could possibly be down
there that we would need?

19:24.538 --> 19:26.106
I don't know.

19:26.107 --> 19:29.077
How about a power source
capable of dialing back to Earth?

19:29.078 --> 19:30.213
Come on...

19:30.214 --> 19:31.514
You never know.

19:31.515 --> 19:32.717
These people don't look
like they were that advanced.

19:32.718 --> 19:35.622
Actually, many advanced
alien civilizations

19:35.623 --> 19:38.159
found in the milky way
and Pegasus galaxies

19:38.160 --> 19:41.099
lived in what appeared to be
primitive stone architecture

19:41.100 --> 19:43.469
that concealed extremely
powerful technology.

19:45.674 --> 19:50.048
I admit that was a big nerd
moment, but it's true, isn't it?

19:50.049 --> 19:52.051
All right, you got the kino footage.

19:52.052 --> 19:53.052
Let's go.

19:53.053 --> 19:54.522
Yeah, that's the thing.

19:54.523 --> 19:59.297
We don't... have the kino footage.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.434
What do you mean?

20:02.670 --> 20:05.006
It's a bit of a maze down there...

20:05.007 --> 20:06.443
You lost it?

20:06.444 --> 20:08.946
No, I took a wrong turn
trying to steer it out.

20:08.947 --> 20:12.686
I just need to take a
look and get my bearings.

20:12.687 --> 20:15.492
The footage may be important.

20:19.699 --> 20:20.967
Just...

20:20.968 --> 20:22.270
Okay, okay.

20:22.271 --> 20:24.274
All right, I'm going to stay
up here and cover your backs.

20:24.275 --> 20:26.178
What are you, scared?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.625
That was a joke.

20:37.998 --> 20:42.572
I'm sorry, I must have mistakenly
thought we were on that level now.

20:42.573 --> 20:47.113
You know, friends who can
kid each other like that?

20:47.114 --> 20:48.549
Please don't kill me?

20:48.550 --> 20:50.018
Come on, Sergeant, you
can take up the rear.

20:50.019 --> 20:51.254
We won't go far.

20:51.255 --> 20:52.590
Yes, sir.

20:59.035 --> 21:00.503
What's his problem?

21:00.504 --> 21:03.342
I didn't think anything scared him.

21:03.343 --> 21:04.744
He's a little claustrophobic.

21:37.402 --> 21:38.503
I need to sit down.

21:38.504 --> 21:39.505
Okay.

22:26.755 --> 22:32.330
God is our refuge and strength,

22:32.331 --> 22:35.568
a very present help in trouble.

22:35.569 --> 22:37.472
Therefore we shall not fear,

22:37.473 --> 22:40.577
though the Earth be removed,

22:40.578 --> 22:43.817
though the mountains be carried
into the midst of the sea,

22:43.818 --> 22:49.460
though its waters roar and be troubled,

22:49.461 --> 22:52.733
though the mountains shake
at the swelling thereof.

22:52.734 --> 23:00.112
There is a river, the streams
whereof make glad the city of God,

23:00.113 --> 23:00.947
the holy habitation of the most high...

23:00.948 --> 23:02.683
I want you to practice, okay?

23:02.684 --> 23:04.252
Okay.

23:04.253 --> 23:06.589
God is in the midst of her.

23:06.590 --> 23:09.395
She will not be moved.

23:12.234 --> 23:18.511
God will help her
when the morning dawns.

23:18.512 --> 23:20.781
Thank you.

24:02.421 --> 24:03.556
What was that?

24:03.557 --> 24:05.560
Probably wind.

24:05.561 --> 24:07.629
Anyone else think we've seen enough?

24:08.831 --> 24:11.937
Weren't you the one
hoping for dead bodies?

24:11.938 --> 24:14.274
Some evidence of human
skeletal remains, actually,

24:14.275 --> 24:15.275
and there don't seem to be any.

24:15.276 --> 24:17.646
Oh well!

24:17.647 --> 24:19.550
Oh! Oh, God, get it off!

24:19.551 --> 24:20.619
Get it off!

24:20.620 --> 24:22.422
Get off!

24:23.758 --> 24:25.728
Okay, that's it. I am out of here!

24:28.800 --> 24:30.603
Good idea. Let's go.

24:32.708 --> 24:33.942
Stop.

24:33.943 --> 24:35.278
Why?

24:37.950 --> 24:39.451
Don't move.

24:39.452 --> 24:41.588
Oh, my God, what? What is it?

24:44.828 --> 24:46.061
Run.

25:00.956 --> 25:02.023
I think you got it.

25:10.231 --> 25:13.435
Lieutenant Scott, this is
Colonel Young, do you read?

25:15.340 --> 25:17.376
Lieutenant Scott,
Sergeant Greer, come in.

25:17.377 --> 25:19.747
This is Scott, sir.

25:19.748 --> 25:21.283
I'm glad to hear your voice, sir.

25:21.284 --> 25:22.552
We are...

25:22.553 --> 25:24.823
in a bit of a pickle down here.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.125
What's that?

25:26.126 --> 25:29.429
We are trapped in an underground tunnel.

25:29.430 --> 25:30.732
We were exploring the ruins.

25:30.733 --> 25:34.773
Sergeant Greer was
forced to fire his weapon.

25:34.774 --> 25:36.308
The tunnel collapsed on us.

25:36.309 --> 25:37.811
No one is hurt.

25:37.812 --> 25:43.889
Eli and Chloe are looking for another
way out, but if they can't find one,

25:43.890 --> 25:45.225
we're going to need help
getting out of here, sir.

25:45.226 --> 25:49.631
Why was Sergeant Greer
forced to use his weapon?

25:49.632 --> 25:52.671
There was a spider, sir.
It was approaching Chloe.

25:52.672 --> 25:54.608
A spider?

25:54.609 --> 25:57.546
It was a sizable spider, sir.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.250
I'll send a team.

26:01.386 --> 26:03.289
Young out.

26:03.290 --> 26:05.460
Less than two hours
before we jump into FTL.

26:07.598 --> 26:10.736
This is my fault.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.340
We shouldn't have come down here.

26:16.347 --> 26:20.920
So, the good news is, we haven't
run into any more spiders.

26:20.921 --> 26:22.523
Did you find the kino?

26:22.524 --> 26:24.927
No, unfortunately, these
tunnels seem to go on forever.

26:24.928 --> 26:27.632
We haven't found any other sort of exit

26:27.633 --> 26:29.368
or access to ground level.

26:29.369 --> 26:30.436
We heard wind howling.

26:30.437 --> 26:32.439
No, no...

26:32.440 --> 26:34.477
That's what you said it was.

26:34.478 --> 26:36.547
Me, I'm already having
trouble breathing.

26:36.548 --> 26:37.982
No, there's air down here.

26:37.983 --> 26:39.753
My heart rate is very high.

26:39.754 --> 26:41.255
Oh, slightly dizzy.

26:42.257 --> 26:43.826
All right, calm down.

26:43.827 --> 26:45.029
There's got to be more than
one way in and out of here.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.867
I take it the digging is not going well.

26:49.537 --> 26:50.939
We got c-4.

26:50.940 --> 26:54.010
That's not going to do
anything but make this worse.

26:54.011 --> 26:56.549
Colonel Young just
radioed through the gate.

26:56.550 --> 26:57.717
They're sending a rescue team.

26:59.722 --> 27:01.591
And what are they going to do?

27:05.866 --> 27:08.869
Lieutenant Scott, it's
Lieutenant James, do you read?

27:10.440 --> 27:11.541
James, we hear you?

27:11.542 --> 27:12.843
Where are you?

27:12.844 --> 27:15.281
We just found the tunnel entrance.

27:15.282 --> 27:16.550
Is everyone okay down there?

27:16.551 --> 27:17.786
Yeah, we're fine.

27:17.787 --> 27:18.954
Look...

27:18.955 --> 27:19.988
How bad is it?

27:21.593 --> 27:25.299
I'm not going to lie to you.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.801
It does not look good.

27:26.802 --> 27:28.070
But we're going to get you out of there.

27:28.071 --> 27:30.942
Okay, let's get to work!

28:06.404 --> 28:08.841
Dr. Rush?

28:08.842 --> 28:11.679
I'm sorry,
I rang the bell several times.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.983
The door was open.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.653
Yes.

28:15.654 --> 28:18.791
Your nose is bleeding again.

28:20.062 --> 28:21.597
I've got some great news.

28:21.598 --> 28:24.035
Our source inside the Lucian
Alliance has come through.

28:24.036 --> 28:27.407
We've got the location of a planet that
just might suit our power requirements.

28:27.408 --> 28:30.478
Well, that's terrific.

28:30.479 --> 28:32.148
I thought you'd be more excited.

28:32.149 --> 28:34.552
I mean, it's going to take some doing.

28:34.553 --> 28:36.823
There's a mining outpost
being run by a small...

28:36.824 --> 28:43.702
Dr. Jackson, do you understand
anything on that board?

28:45.707 --> 28:47.474
No, not really. Why? Should I?

28:47.475 --> 28:50.046
No. I don't either.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.454
I didn't expect
it to just present itself.

28:54.455 --> 28:55.522
I mean, why should it?

28:55.523 --> 28:56.591
It's a code.

28:56.592 --> 28:58.461
It's meant to be hidden.

28:58.462 --> 29:00.130
A code for what?

29:02.002 --> 29:03.069
Destiny.

29:04.740 --> 29:09.514
This is all information
stored in her memory banks.

29:09.515 --> 29:13.620
At least, I suspect,
a small fraction of it.

29:13.621 --> 29:17.560
All completely meaningless to
me in this form, without context.

29:17.561 --> 29:20.999
And, unfortunately, I don't
think staying here any longer

29:21.000 --> 29:23.238
is going to make it much clearer.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.141
Are you going somewhere?

29:25.142 --> 29:26.877
Yup, I'm done.

29:26.878 --> 29:27.912
How's your wife doing?

29:36.227 --> 29:39.666
She's dying.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.169
Today, actually.

29:41.170 --> 29:44.674
I really am sorry.

29:44.675 --> 29:47.646
Yeah, so am I.

29:49.050 --> 29:50.952
Shouldn't you be with her?

29:53.224 --> 29:55.560
You keep saying that.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.230
Yeah, well, it's true, isn't it?

30:00.771 --> 30:02.539
What's the date today?

30:02.540 --> 30:03.841
You say your wife is going to die today,

30:03.842 --> 30:05.077
but you don't remember what day it is...

30:05.078 --> 30:06.780
No, please, please, just tell me.

30:06.781 --> 30:08.550
April 6th.

30:10.053 --> 30:11.756
April the 6th...

30:15.095 --> 30:17.332
She's taken a turn for the worse.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.035
The doctors say the
situation's very grave.

30:19.036 --> 30:20.103
They don't think she's going
to make it through the day.

30:20.104 --> 30:20.972
Thank you.

30:33.761 --> 30:35.196
April 6.

30:35.197 --> 30:36.264
What does that mean?

30:36.265 --> 30:40.605
I don't know, but Gloria
didn't die on April 6th.

30:46.751 --> 30:48.086
Well, it's not the ultimate answer

30:48.087 --> 30:49.353
to life, the universe, and everything.

30:49.354 --> 30:52.126
That's 42.

30:52.127 --> 30:53.360
Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

30:53.361 --> 30:54.831
Yes, thank you,
you've been very helpful.

31:07.220 --> 31:11.693
The address of this
house is number 4, not 46.

31:13.196 --> 31:15.366
Why does it say 46 on the door?

31:15.367 --> 31:19.406
Well, 46 divided by two is 23.

31:19.407 --> 31:23.013
I'm sure you've heard of the 23 enigma.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.417
Yeah, it refers to some
ridiculous notion

31:25.418 --> 31:28.188
that everything and anything
is connected to the number 23.

31:28.189 --> 31:30.092
Most rational people
acknowledge the enigma

31:30.093 --> 31:31.194
is merely evidence of the mind's power

31:31.195 --> 31:33.697
to perceive truth in almost anything.

31:33.698 --> 31:35.835
Yeah, if you look for it...

31:35.836 --> 31:37.237
You're going to find it.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.722
So, what is this?

31:50.028 --> 31:52.864
Is this my mind playing tricks?

31:52.865 --> 31:55.336
Am I seeing something that's not there?

31:57.340 --> 32:00.779
Convincing myself this
is somehow significant?

32:00.780 --> 32:01.913
Significant...

32:03.083 --> 32:04.151
Dr. Rush?

32:09.529 --> 32:12.065
Lieutenant James, this
is Colonel Young, come in.

32:14.904 --> 32:19.043
I wish I had better news for you, sir.

32:19.044 --> 32:21.983
We're doing the best we can, but...

32:21.984 --> 32:23.451
Things are pretty slow-moving.

32:23.452 --> 32:25.121
You're running out of time.

32:25.122 --> 32:27.024
Yes, sir, we know.

32:27.025 --> 32:28.526
Okay, can I panic now?

32:29.998 --> 32:31.866
We've got less than half an hour.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.004
We're not going to make it.

32:35.574 --> 32:37.275
Seriously, what are we going to do?

32:42.953 --> 32:46.024
Sir, he just suffered
some sort of cardiac event.

32:46.025 --> 32:47.326
He seems somewhat stabilized,

32:47.327 --> 32:50.399
but I don't know how much
more of this he can take.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.501
Leaving him in
there is going to kill him?

32:51.502 --> 32:54.439
I think so, sir.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.975
It's just a matter of time.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.446
And you said pulling him
out could kill him, too.

32:58.447 --> 33:02.085
I know I advised against it, but maybe
it's better to opt for risk over certainty.

33:02.086 --> 33:03.621
Unfortunately, things are
not going well on the planet.

33:03.622 --> 33:06.393
Looks like we're not going to
have enough time to dig them out.

33:06.394 --> 33:08.463
However, if Rush can find
the master code,

33:08.464 --> 33:12.603
we may be able to stall
Destiny's jump into FTL.

33:12.604 --> 33:14.073
We risk sacrificing Rush.

33:14.074 --> 33:16.911
According to you, he's choosing
to stay connected to that chair.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.915
He may not be aware of
the danger that he's in.

33:18.916 --> 33:22.621
If we jump to FTL, Eli,
Scott, Greer, and Chloe

33:22.622 --> 33:24.591
are going to be left behind,

33:24.592 --> 33:26.961
so right now, looks like
their best chance is Rush.

33:39.148 --> 33:41.985
We couldn't find any other access.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.990
Maybe it's time we made one.

33:46.994 --> 33:49.698
Lieutenant, we're running out of time.

33:49.699 --> 33:50.699
Yeah, we know.

33:50.700 --> 33:55.008
We're going to use c-4 to try and
blow a hole in the top of the tunnel.

33:55.009 --> 33:57.311
How far back do you estimate you
are from the collapsed opening?

33:57.312 --> 33:59.248
Not far.

33:59.249 --> 34:00.784
About 10 meters.

34:00.785 --> 34:03.322
Move as far back as you can, and
let me know when you're clear.

34:03.323 --> 34:04.757
Copy that.

34:06.395 --> 34:07.930
Let's go, guys.

34:11.003 --> 34:13.139
Good?

34:13.139 --> 34:14.741
We'll see.

34:16.078 --> 34:17.179
We're ready up here.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.750
Hopefully, we're clear down here.

34:23.225 --> 34:24.893
Fire in the hole!

34:37.917 --> 34:41.922
Lieutenant, do you read?

34:41.924 --> 34:43.291
Yeah, we're still here.

34:43.292 --> 34:44.860
Doesn't look like that
had the desired effect.

34:44.860 --> 34:48.301
No, sir. We just made
things a lot worse.

34:51.773 --> 34:52.908
I'm sorry.

34:52.909 --> 34:54.511
No, it's not your fault, Lt.

34:54.512 --> 34:55.980
You did the best you could.

34:55.981 --> 35:00.054
No... get your team back to the ship.

35:00.055 --> 35:01.957
Sir, we still have time...

35:01.958 --> 35:03.059
Not much.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.461
That was an order, Lieutenant.

35:04.462 --> 35:06.098
Go.

35:47.872 --> 35:49.140
You're not here for me.

35:51.411 --> 35:54.148
I've already been through this.

35:54.149 --> 35:56.887
No, you haven't. Not really.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.860
I was here.

36:00.861 --> 36:03.231
You can't lie to yourself.

36:05.102 --> 36:09.441
You chose this memory because
it's one you'd rather just forget.

36:15.853 --> 36:18.357
What you need is here now.

36:18.358 --> 36:20.261
That's why you're here.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.900
It's not for me.

36:23.901 --> 36:28.374
You just want your answer.

36:28.375 --> 36:30.578
I need an answer.

36:32.048 --> 36:33.917
You're dying.

36:33.918 --> 36:36.856
I know.

36:36.857 --> 36:41.464
You'd rather die than fail?

36:41.465 --> 36:46.339
What have you become, Nicholas?

36:46.340 --> 36:50.446
The things you've done,
that's not who you are.

36:50.447 --> 36:53.451
It's not you.

36:53.452 --> 36:58.026
I always had it in me...

36:58.027 --> 37:03.269
to make the hard decisions.

37:03.270 --> 37:05.439
I have reasons.

37:07.377 --> 37:08.577
Good reasons.

37:08.578 --> 37:11.984
To hurt people?

37:11.985 --> 37:16.258
Are you sure?

37:16.259 --> 37:18.395
You tell yourself my
death gave you courage.

37:21.368 --> 37:23.670
In truth, it made you callous.

37:23.671 --> 37:26.976
You're not the man I loved.

37:29.482 --> 37:31.718
He died with you.

37:31.719 --> 37:35.559
I was never your conscience, Nicholas.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.993
You still have one of your own.

37:36.994 --> 37:41.235
You just need to listen to it.

37:41.236 --> 37:46.578
Some people live their whole
lives and never find what we had.

37:48.548 --> 37:52.688
Don't let what happened
to me change you this way.

37:52.689 --> 37:55.493
It's nobody's fault.

37:59.067 --> 38:02.705
I know...

38:02.706 --> 38:05.244
I know that.

38:05.245 --> 38:06.511
It's one stupid gene.

38:06.512 --> 38:13.156
Passed on to me by my mother,
incapable of performing

38:13.157 --> 38:19.468
its one simple function,
to repair damaged DNA.

38:20.738 --> 38:22.473
That's it, isn't it?
That's why you're here.

38:24.645 --> 38:27.048
Of course.

38:28.517 --> 38:30.053
Go.

38:38.770 --> 38:42.174
I know how much you loved me.

38:44.613 --> 38:46.715
Stop taking it out on everyone else.

38:48.520 --> 38:53.628
I haven't forgotten you, Gloria...

38:53.629 --> 38:57.133
and I never will.

39:05.082 --> 39:07.117
Dr. Rush?

39:07.118 --> 39:08.620
Now, listen to me.

39:08.621 --> 39:11.625
We got five minutes to stop
this ship from jumping into FTL.

39:11.626 --> 39:12.627
What?

39:12.628 --> 39:14.530
Peoples' lives are depending on it.

39:14.531 --> 39:16.100
I can't...

39:16.101 --> 39:17.135
I can't do that.

39:17.136 --> 39:19.239
I can't do that...

39:19.240 --> 39:21.309
I can't do anything about that...

39:26.285 --> 39:27.453
Lieutenant Scott, can you hear me?

39:27.454 --> 39:29.723
Yes, sir.

39:29.724 --> 39:32.128
We can't stop it.

39:39.876 --> 39:42.479
Understood, sir.

39:43.716 --> 39:45.151
God be with you, Colonel.

39:45.152 --> 39:46.820
All of you.

39:49.759 --> 39:51.528
It's not over, son.

39:51.529 --> 39:52.596
Don't give up.

40:26.457 --> 40:28.259
They just jumped.

40:39.346 --> 40:42.150
What are you doing out of the infirmary?

40:42.151 --> 40:43.553
I got work to do, Colonel.

40:43.554 --> 40:45.122
How about solving the access code

40:45.123 --> 40:46.892
that's going to allow us
to turn this ship around?

40:48.262 --> 40:50.597
Well, funnily enough...

40:50.598 --> 40:52.133
I thought you didn't find anything.

40:52.134 --> 40:53.570
I didn't say that.

40:53.571 --> 40:55.806
I said I couldn't stop
the ship then and there.

40:55.807 --> 40:59.847
And even though it nearly killed
me, I managed to find a clue

40:59.848 --> 41:01.483
which may give us control of this ship

41:01.484 --> 41:02.686
once and for all.

41:02.687 --> 41:04.856
A clue?

41:04.857 --> 41:06.158
46.

41:06.159 --> 41:09.163
Well, that seems a little too simple.

41:09.164 --> 41:11.134
It's the number of
chromosomes in human DNA.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.169
Genetic code.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.305
This helps us how?

41:13.306 --> 41:15.875
Well, we know in other cases,
with their later technologies,

41:15.876 --> 41:19.548
that the ancients used
sensors that restricted access

41:19.549 --> 41:21.685
by detecting specific genetic markers.

41:21.686 --> 41:24.356
The access code to the
Destiny is not like that.

41:24.357 --> 41:25.592
It's definitely numerological.

41:25.593 --> 41:26.694
The problem we've had cracking it

41:26.695 --> 41:28.998
is that we had no basis,
nowhere to start.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.868
We were just taking
wild shots in the dark.

41:30.869 --> 41:32.204
And now?

41:32.205 --> 41:33.339
Now we know where to start.

41:33.340 --> 41:36.645
They used their own genetic
code, likely a specific one.

41:36.646 --> 41:38.581
More evolved than ours, no doubt,

41:38.583 --> 41:40.919
but all we have to do now is
run through the variations.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.490
We're still talking about
billions of possibilities here.

41:43.491 --> 41:48.633
I've written a program which is
going to go through the permutations.

41:48.634 --> 41:50.334
So how long is this going to that take?

41:50.335 --> 41:51.738
Several days.

41:51.739 --> 41:53.674
Really?

41:53.675 --> 41:55.244
Or several years...

41:55.245 --> 41:56.413
I was trying to be a
little bit more optimistic.

41:56.414 --> 41:58.616
That's a little different for you.

42:01.889 --> 42:02.957
Rush...

42:02.958 --> 42:07.499
All this, this was worth
risking your life for?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.635
We'll see.
