00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.838 --> 00:05.771
(theme song playing)

00:08.676 --> 00:12.277
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within</i> ¶

00:12.279 --> 00:14.680
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:20.352
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:23.188
<i> ¶ Got a beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:27.993
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:27.995 --> 00:30.696
<i> ¶ And I'll get there I swear ¶</i>

00:30.698 --> 00:36.135
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:42.743 --> 00:45.210
Okay, guys, wait for it.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.745
How's this?

00:48.015 --> 00:49.481
Hmm, too bohemian.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.983
Ugh.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.585
What about this?

00:54.688 --> 00:55.888
(squeaks)

00:55.890 --> 00:57.356
Way too uptight.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.991
Mm-hmm?

00:58.993 --> 01:00.359
Too...

01:00.361 --> 01:02.327
Lighten up, Cass.
It's just a painting.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.229
It's more than a painting,
Eugene.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.665
This is the princess's
royal portrait.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.333
She's right.

01:08.335 --> 01:11.236
I mean, every one
of these portraits
says something

01:11.238 --> 01:14.173
about what made
that particular king
or queen unique.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.675
It's tradition,
and she's gotta decide
on her look soon.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.445
The Giovanni gets here
in two days, and from
what I hear,

01:19.447 --> 01:21.947
that guy is as famous
for his temper as he is
for his art.

01:21.949 --> 01:26.051
Well, look at this guy.
He's not doing anything,
and he seems pretty happy.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.420
Whoa! Careful!
These paintings are priceless,

01:28.422 --> 01:29.888
especially that one.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.624
That's the only known
painting of Robin XI.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.761
Wait. This kingdom
had 11 Robins?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.963
Nope. Just this dud.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.465
Cassandra:
They called him Robin XI

01:39.467 --> 01:41.733
because the only thing
interesting about was
that he had--

01:41.735 --> 01:43.202
Nine, ten.
Eleven fingers.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.404
That's right.
I remember reading about him.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.540
Listen, Raps,
if you're trying to find
your defining activity,

01:48.542 --> 01:50.275
don't listen to this dud

01:50.277 --> 01:52.611
whose whole work history
is being a two-bit hood.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.279
(laughing)
Two-bit hood?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.714
Hold the pastry!

01:55.716 --> 01:57.749
I'll have you know, Cassandra,

01:57.751 --> 01:59.985
Flynn Rider was a<i> légende.</i>

01:59.987 --> 02:02.988
(laughs)
Key word being "was."

02:02.990 --> 02:04.490
And what is it you do now?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.425
I, uh...

02:06.427 --> 02:08.093
I do many things.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.394
You know, important things.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.263
So important,
you wouldn't understand them.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.798
Sometimes, I don't
even understand them.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.866
Tell her, Blondie.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.301
Hmm.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.836
What?

02:19.507 --> 02:22.608
(scoffs)
Can you believe that Cassandra?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.810
Two-bit hood?
I mean, she acts like

02:24.812 --> 02:28.780
the only things I've ever
been good at are lying,
cheating, and stealing.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.450
Which, in fairness,
I am very good at.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.352
All:
Hmm.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.355
So you guys agree
with Cassandra?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.523
No, no, no, no, no.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.159
We don't...
(emphatically) agree with her.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.527
We've simply arrived at a...

02:41.529 --> 02:46.131
Well, um, nearly identical
assessment, is all.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.200
Oh, okay.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.668
Okay, I see how it is.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.436
You know, I am capable

02:51.438 --> 02:54.139
of being more
than a handsome,
devil-may-care rogue.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.543
In fact, I can be a handsome,
devil-may-care anything I want.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.380
Maybe I'll just have
to find a way to prove it.

03:01.382 --> 03:05.017
Boys, Eugene Fitzherbert
is gonna find his new calling.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.554
All:
Hmm.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.723
Does no one in this kingdom
have an attention span?

03:11.725 --> 03:12.791
Come on!

03:20.067 --> 03:22.868
Well, you said bake the pie
at 300 degrees for an hour,

03:22.870 --> 03:27.005
but I figured save time
and do 600 degrees
for a half hour.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.073
Math!

03:29.743 --> 03:31.410
Hey! Oh!

03:34.715 --> 03:36.548
(wheels screech)

03:37.484 --> 03:39.318
Thank you.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.886
-Hyah!
-(woman exclaiming)

03:42.590 --> 03:43.789
Record time!

03:44.758 --> 03:46.325
(groaning)

03:46.327 --> 03:47.392
Hyah!

03:49.230 --> 03:51.597
But this isn't my house.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.603
Impressive cobblering.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.205
Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute!

04:00.207 --> 04:01.673
Now I know
where I know you.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.609
You stole a crate
of boots once.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.043
(grunts)

04:05.045 --> 04:06.511
Does this mean
I'm getting the boot?

04:06.513 --> 04:08.614
No, it means
you're getting fired.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.752
(croaking)

04:15.356 --> 04:17.256
(yawns)

04:17.258 --> 04:18.957
-(door slams)
-(exclaiming)

04:18.959 --> 04:23.395
Who knew having a job
would be so much work?
(sighs)

04:23.397 --> 04:26.732
I mean, what
with all those rules
and responsibilities.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.635
You should have heard
some of these guys
I worked for.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.437
It's like, "Hey, buddy,
who died and made you boss?"

04:32.439 --> 04:33.472
(sighs)

04:33.474 --> 04:35.707
Maybe Cassandra was right.

04:35.709 --> 04:39.811
Ugh! Just saying those
four words sent bile
into my mouth, down the throat--

04:39.813 --> 04:41.446
Oh, that--
(shudders)
Yuck!

04:41.448 --> 04:44.149
But it's true.
Maybe the only thing
I was meant to be was a--

04:44.151 --> 04:46.652
Woman:
Thief! Stop! Thief!

04:50.391 --> 04:51.757
I know where he's headed.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.225
I know where he's headed!

04:56.463 --> 04:58.330
Guys, he's headed
for the dock.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.631
We'll handle this, Rider.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.568
And besides,
he ran in the opposite
direction, genius!

05:03.570 --> 05:06.505
No one calls me genius
and gets away with it!

05:14.281 --> 05:15.347
Oof!

05:23.290 --> 05:25.023
(scoffs)
Amateur.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.625
Rider, what are
you doing here?

05:26.627 --> 05:30.362
Well, Captain,
I don't wanna say
I just did your job for you,

05:30.364 --> 05:32.631
but I just did
your job for you.

05:32.633 --> 05:36.268
It was the old
distract-and-run-to-the-dock-
to-catch-the-last-ferry tactic.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.136
I know because I invented it.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.672
Nice hustle, though.
Keep your chin up.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.174
I don't believe it.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.177
Flynn Rider on the side
of law and order.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.881
You're gonna become
a Royal Guard?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.616
It makes total sense, right?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.118
I tried to have a normal job,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.519
but I'm just not great
with authority.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.155
Being a guard,
I am the authority.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.958
Plus, I'd look great
in a uniform.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.127
What's all this?

06:02.129 --> 06:05.197
(sighs)
I was having a lot of trouble
picking just one interest
for my portrait,

06:05.199 --> 06:07.199
and then, it hit me.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.668
I'll pose doing
all of them, right?

06:09.670 --> 06:10.535
What do you think?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.104
Hmm.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.907
-Pascal?
-(croaks)

06:15.909 --> 06:17.843
Maybe not your best idea,

06:17.845 --> 06:19.644
but, but I've heard worse.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.180
Like you becoming
a Royal Guard?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.649
(stammers)
How long have you
been standing there?

06:24.651 --> 06:27.552
Long enough to know
you're about to make
a fool of yourself.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.422
You really think
you have what it takes
to be a guard?

06:30.424 --> 06:32.557
Hmm, let me think.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.559
Superior athletic ability,

06:34.561 --> 06:37.028
razor-sharp acumen,
impressive stature,

06:37.030 --> 06:39.931
making guards
all around the world,
including Corona,

06:39.933 --> 06:41.533
look like bozos for decades.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.068
Yeah, I think I can swing it.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.569
You wanna know what I think?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.104
That I care what you think?

06:46.106 --> 06:49.741
(laughing)
Let me save you the trouble.
I don't.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.778
I bet you don't even make it
through basic training.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.679
(scoffs)
Training?

06:54.681 --> 06:57.015
What, like school?
I was great in school.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.117
Easiest three days of my life.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.585
Who's the teacher anyway?

07:00.587 --> 07:01.686
Cassandra:
My dad.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.089
All right, maggots, line up!

07:07.294 --> 07:08.360
(growls)

07:09.763 --> 07:12.764
This boot camp will push you
to your very limits.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.932
By the time I'm through,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.701
you'll be sweating tears
and crying sweat.

07:16.703 --> 07:20.405
But if you make it through camp
and pass the final exam--

07:20.407 --> 07:22.707
(yawns, smacks lips)

07:22.709 --> 07:24.709
(laughs)
And for some of you,

07:24.711 --> 07:27.145
that's a highly
unlikely if,

07:27.147 --> 07:30.248
you will receive
probationary trainee status.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.751
Shorty, what are
you doing here?

07:32.753 --> 07:35.320
I'm sorry.
Is this the line
for the men's room?

07:35.322 --> 07:39.257
Well, well, looks like
I got a couple of aces
in the mix.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.659
Captain, sir,

07:40.661 --> 07:42.928
I know
we've had our differences,
but I'd just like to say--

07:42.930 --> 07:44.429
Quiet, maggot!

07:44.431 --> 07:47.732
You are a loathsome,
pathetic excuse
for a human being,

07:47.734 --> 07:52.737
and it is my full intention
to make your life
a living nightmare.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.307
You know, I've never
said this to another man,

07:55.309 --> 07:56.808
but you have handsome teeth.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.646
(whistle trills)

08:02.816 --> 08:04.516
(grunting)

08:05.452 --> 08:07.519
(grunting)

08:16.964 --> 08:18.730
(bird screeching)

08:20.133 --> 08:21.867
(whistle trills)

08:21.869 --> 08:23.235
(grunting)

08:42.022 --> 08:43.255
(nickers)

08:47.394 --> 08:48.727
Whoa!

08:49.830 --> 08:51.296
(laughing)

08:51.298 --> 08:53.698
Crossbow procedure
number one, Rider.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.401
Always keep the safety on.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.703
(nickering)

09:01.808 --> 09:04.142
(grunting)

09:04.144 --> 09:06.711
(grunting)

09:06.713 --> 09:09.781
(straining)
Come on. Not fair.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.293
(exclaiming)

09:22.729 --> 09:25.997
(guards laughing)

09:25.999 --> 09:29.634
Rapunzel:
All right, Pascal,
I think this is everything.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.837
Okay, we're gonna be
more than ready

09:32.839 --> 09:34.673
for The Giovanni
tomorrow morning.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.775
(sighs deeply)

09:36.777 --> 09:38.677
(gasps)
Oops!

09:38.679 --> 09:39.844
(exclaims)

09:39.846 --> 09:41.746
Darling, is everything okay?

09:43.784 --> 09:46.751
(laughs)
Let me guess.
Your portrait?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.587
Let me show you something.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.427
Oh! (giggling)

09:55.429 --> 09:58.597
Sorry.
Mom, come on.
It's just...

09:59.533 --> 10:00.799
(sighs)

10:00.801 --> 10:03.969
Horrible? Yes, horrible.
It's horrible. (laughs)

10:03.971 --> 10:07.405
My point is,
we're not always defined
by the things we can do,
Rapunzel,

10:07.407 --> 10:09.874
but rather by
the people we are.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.977
That's what your portrait
should communicate.

10:11.979 --> 10:12.777
(chitters)

10:12.779 --> 10:14.913
(laughs)
I know. I know.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.881
Don't be so smug, Pascal.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.385
Cassandra:
Ready to give up?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.954
(laughs wryly)
Oh, you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.724
Honestly, I don't care.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.826
Look, it doesn't matter
anyway, okay?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.961
No matter how hard I try
on that final tomorrow,

10:29.963 --> 10:32.998
your dad will cook up
some cheap shot
to make sure I fail.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.966
He wants me out,
end of story.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.138
You know,
for someone who spent

10:40.140 --> 10:43.174
most of his life
breaking the rules
to get what he wants,

10:43.176 --> 10:45.844
you're having
an awful lot of trouble
dealing with someone

10:45.846 --> 10:48.913
who is breaking the rules
to get what he wants.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.424
(snoring)

10:59.426 --> 11:01.393
(sighs exasperatedly)
Where is Eugene?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.830
The rules are simple.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.065
Obstacle course.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.101
Whistle.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.538
Complete the course
before the whistle blows.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.973
Is that clear?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.709
Actually, sir, can you
go through that one more time?

11:17.711 --> 11:21.846
It's just my brain
is so used to tuning
your voice out that I--

11:21.848 --> 11:23.014
Line up, Rider.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.350
I can't believe
you made it this far.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.018
But I'm glad you did.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.488
Because I made this course
especially difficult

11:30.490 --> 11:33.692
just... for... you.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.726
I'm touched.

11:34.728 --> 11:35.994
Get off me!

11:35.996 --> 11:37.062
Go!

11:37.998 --> 11:39.264
(snoring)

11:42.502 --> 11:44.703
(Shorty snores, grunts)

11:46.506 --> 11:47.672
(exclaims)

11:47.674 --> 11:48.740
(growls)

12:02.689 --> 12:04.989
(grunting)

12:08.695 --> 12:09.761
(grunting)

12:09.763 --> 12:10.829
(exclaims triumphantly)

12:10.831 --> 12:14.165
(panting)

12:14.167 --> 12:15.233
(chuckling)

12:19.172 --> 12:20.739
Hup! Ho!

12:21.908 --> 12:23.108
(exclaims)

12:26.213 --> 12:27.278
Huh?

12:31.585 --> 12:33.017
Almost forgot something.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.224
(snoring)

12:39.226 --> 12:41.259
Someone had
to make this challenging.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.527
(sniffs)

12:42.529 --> 12:44.929
Oh. You never did
find that men's room,
did you, Shorty?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.975
Ha! You lose!

12:56.977 --> 12:59.144
(laughing)

12:59.146 --> 13:01.479
-Where's my--
-(whistle trilling)

13:01.481 --> 13:05.650
Complete the course
before the whistle blows, right?

13:05.652 --> 13:08.720
Look at that.
I can follow rules.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.589
I'll take
a medium uniform, sir,
athletic fit.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.358
(cheering)

13:16.129 --> 13:17.195
(whinnies)

13:23.136 --> 13:24.302
Hey, Pete, look alive.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.904
This must be the guy.
Look at him.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.573
Mister, uh, The Giovanni.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.008
The John-a-vanni...
Johnny-Johnny.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.342
Johnny, welcome!

13:31.344 --> 13:32.811
Corona is happy to have you.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.979
Yeah, well, at least
someone is happy.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.081
Now, where's Princess
<i> come si chiama?</i>

13:37.083 --> 13:39.150
Uh, she'll be here shortly.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.619
The Giovanni,
he don't like to wait.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.788
Now, leave me here.

13:43.790 --> 13:47.192
Ah. Maybe The Giovanni,
he learn something...

13:47.194 --> 13:49.694
by studying
how not to paint.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.604
Hey! Nice!

14:00.540 --> 14:02.373
Reporting for duty, Cap.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.375
What do you got, huh?
(chuckles)

14:04.377 --> 14:06.211
Bad guys to be nabbed?

14:06.213 --> 14:07.879
Mysteries to be solved?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.047
I'm ready for anything.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.818
(mice squeaking)

14:13.820 --> 14:15.353
Dungeon duty. Great.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.821
This is your post.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.024
That main entrance
is to remain locked
at all times.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.228
You are to patrol
this entire block
every five minutes.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.462
Do you understand?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.999
There's only one prisoner?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.701
Do you understand?

14:29.703 --> 14:33.137
Yeah, but I just thought,
you know, given my skill set,

14:33.139 --> 14:36.507
it would make more sense
for me to be running
and jumping.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.077
You're not being paid
to think, Rider.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.145
Every five minutes.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.554
It's about time!

14:49.556 --> 14:52.323
Sorry, The Giovanni,
I was, um...

14:52.325 --> 14:54.225
The Giovanni, he doesn't care!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.860
Now, how you wanna look?

14:55.862 --> 14:59.864
Oh, um, I thought
that I would keep it simple.
(chuckles)

14:59.866 --> 15:02.667
Huh?
She gonna pose with nothing?

15:02.669 --> 15:03.968
(exclaims in Italian)

15:03.970 --> 15:06.404
Don't blame The Giovanni
when the painting,
she's no good.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.172
Oh. Okay.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.708
I definitely won't.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.877
Hmm.

15:12.879 --> 15:16.281
The Giovanni.
Can I call you The?
You're the best.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.082
Hey, Blondie,
I see you went

15:18.084 --> 15:21.419
with the simple choice
of beautiful.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.288
Aw! Thank you.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.290
At least someone thinks so.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.125
Wait. What are you doing here?

15:27.127 --> 15:28.927
Cass said you had
dungeon duty.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.428
Oh, I do.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.230
The Cap told me
to walk the block
once every five minutes,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.132
but it just seemed
like a waste standing there.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.266
So, I walked it
twice in a row,

15:35.268 --> 15:36.968
and now, I can take
a 10-minute break.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.102
Math.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.639
Yeah, uh, I don't think
that's right.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.074
Oh, no, no,
trust me, Blondie.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.310
I worked it all out
in the old brainium.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.579
(grumbling)
You go now!
(exclaiming in Italian)

15:48.581 --> 15:49.714
What did you say?

15:49.716 --> 15:52.116
(speaking in Italian)

15:52.118 --> 15:53.785
I can no concentrate.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.121
Captain:
Rider, where are you?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.556
Eugene:
He escaped?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.158
How?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.561
Apparently, someone
didn't follow regulation

16:03.563 --> 16:05.263
and left
the main door unlocked,

16:05.265 --> 16:07.465
so they could go
to visit their girlfriend.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.133
Gah! Math!

16:09.135 --> 16:10.969
And because
of your delinquency,

16:10.971 --> 16:14.272
the prisoner was able
to seize the opportunity
to pick his cell lock

16:14.274 --> 16:15.573
and escape.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.342
Uh, I know this looks bad.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.843
You bet it does.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.979
Turn in your helmet
and shield, hotshot.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.714
You're off the Guard.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.189
Aw, I should have just done
what I was asked. So stupid!

16:31.191 --> 16:33.358
(sniffing)

16:33.360 --> 16:36.194
Why don't you drown
your sorrows in a yam?

16:36.196 --> 16:39.464
Uh, thanks, buddy,
but I filled up on yams earlier.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.999
Who wants to be a guard anyway?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.301
Right? All those
responsibilities and rules.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.202
Plus, the Captain is a total--

16:44.204 --> 16:45.269
Whoa!

16:46.473 --> 16:49.173
So sorry, the Giovanni.
Let me help.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
Ugh!
(grumbles)

16:51.011 --> 16:54.078
(speaking in Italian)
Watch where you're going.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.683
Something smells fishy.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.785
That would be me.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.722
Hey, Blondie.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.325
Portrait is done already.
That's great.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.493
That was quick.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.527
How did it turn out?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.396
Holy horribleness!

17:11.398 --> 17:14.899
I don't know.
I don't get it.
It's just... Mmm.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.668
Really bad.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.237
Right?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.471
Yeah, I'd say.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.806
That is really terrible.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.308
Some world-famous artist!
I could do a better--

17:25.345 --> 17:27.311
(gasps)
I gotta go see the captain.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.349
Look, Cap, I know
I'm not on your good side,

17:31.351 --> 17:33.751
but the portrait
of Robin XI has been stolen.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.053
No, it hasn't.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.587
You wanna know why it hasn't?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.323
Because my men
can adhere to procedures.

17:39.325 --> 17:43.928
Procedure dictates
that the gallery be patrolled
every five minutes.

17:43.930 --> 17:44.996
Stan? Pete?

17:44.998 --> 17:46.864
Um, sorry, Eugene.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.733
We just checked two seconds
before you arrived.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.234
Everything was fine.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.502
But it's a counterfeit!

17:51.504 --> 17:54.639
Enough! Get lost
before I lock you up.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.212
Come on, Shorty.
We're just gonna have
to stop him on our own.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.915
Not totally on your own.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.117
Cassandra?
You believe me?

18:06.119 --> 18:08.953
You may be an arrogant,
self-centered, inconsiderate--

18:08.955 --> 18:10.221
Poorly-dressed.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.791
...bloviating, tremendous
waste of space windbag--

18:13.793 --> 18:16.461
Okay, okay, can we just cut
to the "but" in this sentence?

18:16.463 --> 18:20.198
But I'm guessing
you didn't become a legend
by not trusting your gut.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.467
So if you say
something is not right,

18:22.469 --> 18:23.801
(reluctantly)
I might believe it.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.036
Cass, I...

18:25.038 --> 18:27.405
Plus, if you are wrong
and fall flat on your face,

18:27.407 --> 18:28.906
I'll be the first to see it.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.274
I can work with that. Okay.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.710
Come on. I think
I know where he's headed.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.378
Uh...

18:34.380 --> 18:35.713
Wait.
What are we doing again?

18:36.783 --> 18:39.317
Sir, we found this nut
by the palace gate.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.719
-You want us to lock him up?
-(muffled shouting)

18:41.721 --> 18:44.155
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Slow down. Who are you?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.723
(shouting in Italian)

18:45.725 --> 18:47.558
I am the real The Giovanni.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.461
(Giovanni shouting in Italian)

18:50.463 --> 18:51.662
Ten fingers.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.064
Captain, that means
Eugene was--

18:53.066 --> 18:56.267
Don't you dare
finish that sentence.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.568
Now, come on.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.842
He's gonna try to catch
the last ferry out of Corona.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.146
Hyah!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.821
(whinnying)

19:16.823 --> 19:18.222
(exclaiming)

19:19.292 --> 19:23.528
I'm sure that my beard
can be used as a float--

19:23.530 --> 19:24.829
I got it.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.173
It's just you and me, Max.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.554
(grunting)

19:52.158 --> 19:55.526
<i> Arrivederci,</i> baby.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.094
It means "goodbye."

19:58.031 --> 19:59.297
Huh?

19:59.299 --> 20:01.165
Crossbow procedure number one.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.900
Always keep the safety on.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.368
(whinnying)

20:09.576 --> 20:10.775
On it.

20:14.914 --> 20:15.980
Yeah, baby!

20:19.152 --> 20:23.921
Huh. Actually saved
by one of the Captain's
dumb rules.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.389
Don't you dare tell him.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.491
The last thing I want
is to see the guy
get a big head.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.328
(whinnying angrily)

20:32.932 --> 20:35.399
See, I knew something was up
when he cursed me out.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.901
His Italian was terrible.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.470
(laughing)
Subject-verb agreement
was way off.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.206
What? I speak Italian.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.408
They have stuff to steal
in Italy, too, you know.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.210
Anyway, the rest was just
putting the pieces together.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.546
You see,
you gotta think like a crook
in order to catch one.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.781
You just can't teach that, Cap.

20:50.783 --> 20:54.919
Perhaps I acted precipitously
when I dismissed you, Rider.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.621
Ah, let me guess.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.422
You want me
to join the Guard again.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.524
Well, I'm flattered, but--

21:00.526 --> 21:02.927
(laughing)
Oh, no. Heavens, no!

21:02.929 --> 21:05.429
You're a terrible guard, Rider.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.432
But I do have
something else in mind.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.534
Ahem.

21:10.536 --> 21:11.969
Good afternoon, gentlemen,

21:11.971 --> 21:14.605
and welcome
to Thinking Like a Thief.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.974
I am your instructor,
Eugene Fitzherbert.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.243
You may call me Mr. Fitzherbert.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.313
No. Wait.
Professor Fitzherbert.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.547
Let's add
an "honorable" in there.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.917
The Honorable
Professor Fitzherbert.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.586
Esquire.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.787
Masks on.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.624
(gasps)
Take the women and children!

21:33.626 --> 21:35.226
Don't hurt the money!

21:35.228 --> 21:37.461
-(screaming)
-Shorty, wait. Shorty, it's me.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.796
Eugene:
Come back!

21:38.798 --> 21:42.466
Wow! My dad has no idea
what he just unleashed.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.969
Meh, all is well
that ends well, I guess.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.606
Now, are you sure you didn't
want the real Giovanni
to paint your portrait?

21:48.608 --> 21:49.940
Yeah.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.576
I had a better idea
of how I wanted it.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.513
See, a wise person once told me,

21:55.515 --> 21:59.483
<i> we're not always defined</i>
<i> by the things we can do,</i>

21:59.485 --> 22:02.086
<i>but rather by the people we are</i>

22:02.088 --> 22:04.655
<i> and by those we love.</i>

22:06.659 --> 22:10.661
(theme song playing)

22:10.663 --> 22:13.698
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes</i>
<i> opening wider ¶</i>

22:13.700 --> 22:16.267
<i> ¶ My heart burning like fire ¶</i>

22:16.269 --> 22:18.536
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.538 --> 22:20.304
<i> ¶ I'm never going back, no ¶</i>

22:20.306 --> 22:23.474
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase it ¶</i>

22:23.476 --> 22:25.643
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:28.646
