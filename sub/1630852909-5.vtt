WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:27.720 --> 02:34.360
IAN! WHEN YOU WAKE UP, COME TO MY ROOM.
DON'T TELL DAD ANYTHING.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.960
WHO ARE YOU?

03:10.120 --> 03:11.560
-Who is it?
-Ian.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.320
-Does Dad know you're here?
-No.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.240
If he finds out,
we're gonna be in a lot of trouble.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.160
Okay.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.560
Your room's a disaster. What happened?

03:25.640 --> 03:26.600
A bad night.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.200
Why did you wanna see me?

03:29.800 --> 03:30.920
Look.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.560
This girl was at Cielo Grande.
I need to know who she is.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.800
Okay, but I can't see her face well.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.720
If I get her name,
I want more than one piece of chocolate.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.840
No.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.520
All right.
Why do you want to know who she is?

03:54.600 --> 03:57.840
I think this Cielo Grande mystery
has something to do with her.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.000
-How? I don't understand.
-Did you see your mom's letter?

04:01.520 --> 04:05.120
Look. Your mom said Dad's hiding a secret.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.720
And look at this picture.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.320
Dad met this girl here.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.800
Just take care of finding out who she is.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.280
I'll handle the rest. Okay?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.280
Mind you, Dad can't find out anything.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.800
Obviously. Got it.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.040
Could I at least try
one piece of chocolate?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.000
As an advance.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.640
-That's good.
-Good. I hope to see something soon.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.160
Good luck, Detective Ian.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.080
At your service.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.280
It was incredible.
It was like she was talking to Steffi,

04:54.360 --> 04:56.720
but she wasn't really talking to her.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.640
-I can't imagine.
-Weird.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.640
Natasha is bad. She's bad.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.560
What's up?

05:03.480 --> 05:06.600
-Give it up for Sky Vibes.
-It's exciting. It's almost ready.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
Nati.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.480
Could we sing a song together?

05:11.080 --> 05:12.160
Yeah, we could.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.560
We have some posters to put up,
so I'm gonna go with Luz, okay?

05:17.080 --> 05:17.960
-Yeah.
-Shall we?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.000
Anything for Sky Vibes.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.840
8:30 to 9:00, warm-up on land.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.360
9:00 to 9:30,
a session to test the boat and the waves.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.000
Today we train
in the safe canal in good conditions

05:32.080 --> 05:33.760
with no wind or waves.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.040
No reason to take risks the first day.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.880
They haven't released the location.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.440
As you wish.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.120
Just give us a few minutes every so often

05:42.200 --> 05:44.320
to say hi to Steffi and her trainer.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.080
I don't want to miss her looks of defeat.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.480
Yesterday was incredible.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.360
TONIGHT:
BANDS, KARAOKE, AND MUCH MORE

05:55.480 --> 05:56.720
Sky Vibes.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.120
Cool, isn't it? We could go, Juan.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.120
Hi. I'm Fer Monzo,
and this is Juan, my brother.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.360
I thought you were brothers.
I'm Natasha Rossi. It's a pleasure.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.920
-Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.040
-Are you going to the karaoke bar?
-Yeah, I might go.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.520
It'd be good
to relax a little after training.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.680
Good. And to sing
with your new friends, right?

06:29.200 --> 06:31.560
Singing that I'm a great wakeboarder.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.200
Compared to us wakeboarding,
we sing great.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.960
You have to see us.
We're gonna sing at Sky Vibes.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.880
Good. See you tonight then.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.120
Hi, beautiful.
Are you coming to Sky Vibes?

06:46.200 --> 06:49.760
-I have a very special song for you.
-Yeah, let's go, Steff.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.320
A little relaxing would do you good,
wouldn't it?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.760
You look so tense.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.360
You know what would help me relax?
Forgetting about you.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.520
Easy! You just have
to drop out of the competition.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.080
Who knows? Maybe singing is your thing.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.720
That's the first payment.
Can you make an exception?

07:13.040 --> 07:14.680
-We need more time.
-Hi.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.120
Sky Vibes.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.240
Yes. All right.
Tomorrow I'll go to the bank.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.160
Thank you.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.960
Did something happen?

07:24.040 --> 07:26.360
Without the next payment,
we'll lose Cielo.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.200
We have six new competitors
from Natasha's post.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.880
We're gonna get that money.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.800
I doubt it.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.920
We don't even have half.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.480
So your friend Natasha
is going to Sky Vibes?

07:45.320 --> 07:47.920
I figured we could dedicate a song to her.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.680
What do you think
of "We Are the Champions"?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.160
"We Are the Champions"?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.400
But we'd need to win first, wouldn't we?

07:55.760 --> 07:57.720
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.560
I'm overbooked.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.400
Everything okay? You look worried.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.560
Yeah, same as always.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.640
We're opening Sky Vibes in a few hours,
and Cielo has some economic problems,

08:09.720 --> 08:12.200
and, well, we have
a competition coming up.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.120
Nothing else?

08:14.200 --> 08:17.920
If I were in your place,
I'd need a vacation.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.160
Yeah, you guys don't have it easy
either with Natasha.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.600
I think we both need a vacation.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.160
What's with this rivalry
between you two and Natasha?

08:31.880 --> 08:35.280
Well, Natasha, Steffi, and I were a team.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.800
Then Natasha wanted to leave Steffi out.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.200
-I didn't stand for that.
-That's why I love you.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.040
Let's go.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.320
I'll call Pedro, and we'll go.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.240
Empty nest. Letter en route.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.640
What were you doing there?

10:55.840 --> 10:58.520
-What's going on?
-This section is blocked off.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.720
-You can't do that.
-Irene's orders.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.120
-Natasha Rossi hasn't finished training.
-The river isn't hers.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.280
<i>Training finished.</i>

11:06.360 --> 11:07.720
Okay. Let's go!

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
Let's go!

11:15.760 --> 11:18.160
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.200
All right? What do you think, Luz?

11:28.280 --> 11:31.160
I think Steffi really has
a chance against Natasha,

11:32.440 --> 11:34.600
but in this run, you looked kind of tense.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.640
Yeah, I agree with Luz.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.640
Check out how you weren't precise
on this pass.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.760
You look like another wakeboarder.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.400
How do you want me to feel
after what she did to us?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.200
Put that out of your mind.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.280
I already know,
but I can't stop thinking about her.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.280
Last night I could barely sleep.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.920
I agree with Tony.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.080
About what?

11:56.680 --> 11:59.240
It's all up here.
You have to trust yourself.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.080
Of course. I agree,
but it's easier said than done.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.400
Julián can help you.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.280
-He knows how.
-How?

12:06.360 --> 12:09.520
You can overcome anything
with meditation and breathing.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.200
A lot of what happens in our bodies
comes from our minds. Think about it.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.000
It's just a question of trying.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.960
All right. I'll leave you guys alone.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.320
I have to go
because I have a lot to do for Sky Vibes.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.640
But I'm leaving you in good hands. Bye.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.920
No idea, kid. We don't know who
this girl is, but we'll keep an eye out.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.600
This picture seems really old.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.720
I'm gonna take a picture,
publish it, and find out more info.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.800
-Hi, boys. How are you?
-What's up?

12:44.880 --> 12:47.160
-Here you go.
-We're off. Have a good one.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.080
-How's that channel going?
-Great.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.280
I'll triple my views thanks to the twins.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.760
I can say I'm the father
of a total internet star.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.720
They say "influencer," Dad.
"Star" is for dinosaurs like you.

13:05.880 --> 13:09.040
So then tonight
we have to check the projector,

13:09.120 --> 13:11.360
check the sound,
finish arranging the tables,

13:11.440 --> 13:13.120
and check the stage

13:13.200 --> 13:16.480
because a loose floorboard
could hurt someone. Like this one.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.440
-Totally.
-Let's see, Luz. What do you think?

13:21.280 --> 13:22.320
I love it.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.280
Nati, can you stand
in the middle of the stage

13:25.360 --> 13:26.680
so I can fix the lights?

13:26.760 --> 13:27.640
Yeah.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.760
-Here?
-Yeah.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.760
This light flatters you.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.480
I'll take it with me.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.520
-Nervous for the opening tonight?
-Yeah.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
Do you need help? I'm free.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.400
Thanks. You came just in time.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.040
-Grab there. On three.
-Let's go.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.360
One!

13:53.440 --> 13:54.960
Two! Three!

13:56.840 --> 13:57.680
I love it.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.160
-Well done!
-It looks great.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.600
We could go on stage together.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.760
We could, but now
we have to finish all this.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.440
-Will you help me?
-Of course.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.720
-It goes there.
-Thanks.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.200
I thought about what you said.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.680
That you have to train
your mind and not your body?

14:43.760 --> 14:44.600
Yeah.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.720
I can't seem to get Natasha off my mind.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.400
I think you've seen a lot of movies.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.680
Maybe.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.760
But you can count on me.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.840
Before every competition,
I practiced breathing exercises

14:58.920 --> 15:00.720
that really helped me focus.

15:02.120 --> 15:06.040
I usually get really nervous
before competitions. How do you do it?

15:07.480 --> 15:10.840
I use my breath
to reach a state of relaxation.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.760
You know what I need most?

15:14.320 --> 15:17.560
To stop thinking about Natasha.
It's really bothering me.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.040
It's the same.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.560
If you're able to concentrate
on the present

15:23.080 --> 15:27.280
and free yourself from those nerves,
you'll manage with Natasha too.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.440
It might sound really cliche,

15:33.320 --> 15:36.360
but I really feel
really good and relaxed with you.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.160
I love helping you.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.440
We're our own rivals.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.480
Everything on the outside is decoration.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.200
The real competition
is always against ourselves.

15:51.880 --> 15:52.720
Of course.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.200
Breathe.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.200
The air is cold when you inhale.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.960
The air is warm when you exhale.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.280
I hope this works.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.280
I really need it.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.160
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.200
Have you seen Steffi?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.200
Because Juan wanted
to leave her a message.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.680
-No.
-No?

16:35.960 --> 16:40.520
Isn't it crazy how you have them all
eating out of your hand?

16:41.040 --> 16:44.600
Typical vacation situation, isn't it?

16:45.320 --> 16:46.920
Yeah, it sucks.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.880
I'm looking for something for a guest,
and I can't find it.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.040
Sir, I'm looking for what you asked me.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.640
Okay, great. I'll wait in my room then.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.640
-Yeah. I'll be right there.
-Thanks a lot, Noda.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.760
-Don't take too long, please.
-No.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.080
Sucks.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.240
I'll be back.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.680
"Steff."

17:36.120 --> 17:37.800
<i>The squirrel is in the trunk.</i>

17:38.400 --> 17:41.120
<i>I repeat. The squirrel is in the trunk.</i>

17:44.000 --> 17:47.160
<i>You were right.</i>
<i>I found what you were looking for.</i>

17:48.560 --> 17:50.440
<i>I'll wait for you in the usual place.</i>

17:52.080 --> 17:54.480
So you haven't seen Steff?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.880
Brother. I'm not sure about
what we're rehearsing for Sky Vibes.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.400
I don't think "What Pain"
is the right look.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.960
How about a more romantic one
like "Without You"?

18:16.040 --> 18:19.040
Yeah, but "Without You" isn't good for me.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.360
You want Natasha, but I don't
wanna give Steffi a bad impression.

18:22.440 --> 18:26.080
All right, but we have to make this
the best Monzo Twins appearance ever.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.760
Yeah, the best ever.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.000
Excellent.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
-Okay, best ever then.
-Let's go.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.040
Three, two, one.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.680
<i>Tonight, Sky Vibes.</i>

18:35.760 --> 18:39.000
<i>We're the Monzo Twins</i>
<i>from the Delta canals. Know what?</i>

18:39.080 --> 18:40.560
<i>Cielo Grande has a secret.</i>

18:40.640 --> 18:42.320
<i>There's a storeroom at the hotel.</i>

18:42.400 --> 18:44.920
<i>a storeroom, which years ago,</i>
<i>was Sky Vibes,</i>

18:45.440 --> 18:47.240
<i>Cielo Grande's famous karaoke</i> <i>bar.</i>

18:47.320 --> 18:49.000
<i>And tonight it's reopening.</i>

18:49.080 --> 18:52.360
<i>And the Monzo Twins are streaming it</i>
<i>exclusively for you guys.</i>

18:52.440 --> 18:54.440
<i>Do you want a preview? Let's go.</i>

18:57.600 --> 18:59.480
-Neon sign's ready.
-Sign?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.320
-Ready!
-Let's see the disco balls.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.440
Let's go!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.640
I got my grandparents' favorite track.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.400
-"Emergency Love."
-Awesome.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.640
And here we are with Luz,
the heart of Sky Vibes.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.600
Hi!

19:25.240 --> 19:28.320
And Charlie, the boss of Delta Bar
and a friend zone guru.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.200
He'll tell us all the secrets
of tonight's show.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.880
Now?

19:33.560 --> 19:35.200
It… No, guys.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.040
Cut it.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.360
Charlie, man, what's wrong?
You gotta be more spontaneous.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.640
No, "spontaneous" isn't in my DNA.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.520
Also, you could warn me
a little ahead of time so I can prepare.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
Did you guys want to do your song?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.760
You were supposed to come 30 minutes ago.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.920
-Sorry, Luz. We're here now.
-All right. Tony, are the lights ready?

19:58.480 --> 20:01.560
-Ready.
-Good. All right, get on stage right now.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.000
Man, that's my move.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.600
Boys, are you ready?

20:12.680 --> 20:15.040
-Sorry, yes. Ready.
-All right, let's go.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.640
Emergency meeting. Are you there?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
<i>Emergency meeting right now?</i>

20:49.160 --> 20:51.720
<i>-Right now?</i>
-Yes, right now. Can you?

20:52.440 --> 20:54.160
<i>-Where?</i>
-In my room.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.160
Hold on. Someone's at the door.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.640
So funny. Come in.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.720
Do we know about the girl in the pic?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.480
No. Do you have a better pic?

21:13.200 --> 21:16.560
No, there aren't any better ones.
Who did you show it to?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.200
Let me think.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.520
Juan Monzo and Fer Monzo.

21:23.120 --> 21:27.240
So basically you didn't show it to anyone.
I need you to try harder.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.160
Why don't we ask Dad directly?

21:29.240 --> 21:32.440
No, not a word to Dad about this.
I already told you.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.160
Okay. I'll keep trying.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.880
-I'll try harder.
-You better.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.480
But only if you give me
another little advance.

21:40.840 --> 21:44.800
-It seems like you already got it.
-I didn't get anything.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.480
What? I told you it wasn't me.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.160
I'll be back.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.200
So? Any regrets yet?

22:37.280 --> 22:38.760
Enjoying what I've done?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.000
Or working with my friend?

22:41.520 --> 22:44.920
Picking the wrong side, permanent loser.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.240
And you? I think I've seen you.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.920
Julián. I work here.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.440
So we could say that you work for me.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.440
-What macrobiotic juices do you have?
-We have various juices.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.240
There's carrot with orange or apple,

23:05.320 --> 23:06.640
lime, mint and ginger.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.800
And what might macrobiotic be?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.760
Something
that's probably really far from here.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.520
Could you bring me
a mint and ginger juice?

23:16.600 --> 23:20.960
-Yes.
-Or maybe you could bring it to the table.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.240
Julián, right?

23:24.720 --> 23:29.280
-Hello. Am I interrupting something?
-Good luck with your little friend.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.880
-Let's go, Ron.
-No.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.400
No, I don't sing.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.240
Don't be ashamed. All right. Let's go.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.840
-It turned out really pretty. Good job.
-Thanks, yeah.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.640
-Are you gonna sing?
-Of course.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.240
Great. Here are the songs
you can choose from.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.400
Anything by Luis Miguel?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.760
We know all those.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.960
Charlie.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.280
-Tell me.
-Do you know who the girl in the pic is?

24:54.920 --> 24:55.800
No, no idea.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.960
Hello. <i>Fala galera!</i>

25:00.040 --> 25:03.200
Is everything all right?
We're almost ready to get started.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.440
If anyone's not signed up, now's the time.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.760
There are a lot of songs
to choose from. It's gonna be great.

25:15.520 --> 25:20.080
There are organic juices at the bar.
If you'd like one, see Nati and Julián.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.600
Have a nice time. Bye.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.760
-Nati.
-Careful.

25:28.840 --> 25:29.680
Sorry.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.200
Do you know who this is?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.120
No, no idea.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.440
-Were you with Natasha?
-Yes.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.960
But only mint and ginger.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.400
Mint and ginger?

25:43.480 --> 25:44.720
Long story.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.160
Why? What's up?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.960
Nothing. I hope we can get her
as far from Steffi as possible.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.840
-Yeah, true.
-How's it going with Steffi?

25:52.920 --> 25:55.920
Good. I think going out to meditate
helped her a lot.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.160
And could she handle your instructions
for as long as I could?

25:59.240 --> 26:02.080
I must confess
she handled it longer than you.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.520
What? Sorry?

26:04.920 --> 26:06.440
-Hi.
-Help me with this?

26:06.520 --> 26:08.760
Julián, Luz, your turn. Let's go.

26:12.080 --> 26:12.960
Excuse us.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.320
All right, this is a big moment for us.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.920
Reopening the doors to Sky Vibes
is really incredible.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.760
Yes, and to celebrate, the first song
to open this new Sky Vibes

26:34.320 --> 26:38.080
is one my grandparents sang
on this very stage

26:38.680 --> 26:40.960
when Juli and I were… What, nine?

26:41.560 --> 26:44.320
-Nine, ten.
-Nine or ten, around there.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.200
Well, we hope you like it.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.240
Music, Charlie.

27:06.760 --> 27:10.200
<i>That day, different</i>

27:10.720 --> 27:11.920
<i>We looked at each other</i>

27:12.760 --> 27:15.000
<i>It was emergency love</i>

27:15.080 --> 27:18.840
<i>The two of us, almost alone</i>

27:18.920 --> 27:22.640
<i>Our lips, just that</i>

27:22.720 --> 27:24.800
<i>Time went by</i>

27:24.880 --> 27:26.960
<i>I had time</i>

27:27.040 --> 27:28.720
<i>Such a long wait</i>

27:28.800 --> 27:31.040
<i>Without you</i>

27:31.120 --> 27:32.480
<i>And today I miss</i>

27:33.120 --> 27:35.000
<i>The memory of you</i>

27:35.080 --> 27:39.400
<i>Slipping slowly away</i>

27:39.920 --> 27:43.880
<i>Your hands, your caresses</i>

27:43.960 --> 27:47.200
<i>We feel like this</i>

27:47.720 --> 27:52.120
<i>That lost feeling</i>

27:52.200 --> 27:55.600
<i>Why didn't I see it?</i>

27:56.240 --> 27:59.720
<i>Why didn't I see it?</i>

27:59.800 --> 28:03.760
<i>Emergency</i>

28:03.840 --> 28:07.360
<i>Love</i>

28:07.920 --> 28:11.920
<i>Emergency</i>

28:12.000 --> 28:14.520
<i>Love</i>

28:15.840 --> 28:19.800
<i>That day, different</i>

28:19.880 --> 28:21.640
<i>We looked at each other</i>

28:21.720 --> 28:24.120
<i>It was emergency love</i>

28:24.200 --> 28:28.080
<i>The two of us, almost alone</i>

28:28.160 --> 28:32.000
<i>Our lips, just that</i>

28:32.080 --> 28:35.440
<i>Today I wish and I regret</i>

28:35.520 --> 28:39.720
<i>I'm losing your memory</i>

28:40.320 --> 28:44.360
<i>I can't see you in my mirror</i>

28:46.120 --> 28:50.440
<i>I have to look without you</i>

28:54.200 --> 28:58.520
<i>I have to look without you</i>

29:00.720 --> 29:04.920
<i>Emergency</i>

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
<i>Love</i>

29:09.040 --> 29:12.880
<i>Emergency</i>

29:12.960 --> 29:15.600
<i>Love</i>

29:16.720 --> 29:20.520
<i>That day, different</i>

29:21.040 --> 29:22.880
<i>The two of us alone</i>

29:22.960 --> 29:24.920
<i>It was emergency love</i>

29:25.000 --> 29:28.960
<i>The two of us, almost alone</i>

29:29.040 --> 29:35.400
<i>Our lips, just that</i>

29:42.880 --> 29:43.720
Thanks.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.760
-Thank you very much.
-Thanks.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.240
-Thanks.
-Thanks a lot.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.320
-Thanks.
-Thank you very much.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.560
Beautiful, guys.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.480
Thank you very much.
And now, with you guys,

29:59.560 --> 30:04.680
our favorite twins, Juan and Fer Monzo.

30:09.960 --> 30:13.560
This song is dedicated
to a very special person.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.920
And to another one
who is also very special to me.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.400
They're two different people.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.320
-Two very special people.
-Who are different.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.560
Guys, hit it. All right.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.680
All right, let's go.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.840
<i>Baby, I don't know what you want</i>

30:49.920 --> 30:52.520
<i>But without you, I'm nothing</i>

30:52.600 --> 30:54.520
<i>I don't want to change your ideas</i>

30:54.600 --> 30:57.760
<i>I like you like this, you're my spring</i>

30:58.680 --> 31:00.840
<i>I know there's no one like you</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:02.080
<i>You're one in a million</i>

31:02.160 --> 31:03.080
<i>You're a sensation</i>

31:03.160 --> 31:06.160
<i>When you give me that look</i>
<i>You make me fall in love with you</i>

31:06.240 --> 31:08.320
<i>You drive me crazy</i>

31:08.400 --> 31:09.720
<i>You've got attitude</i>

31:09.800 --> 31:11.840
<i>I know without you, I can't do any more</i>

31:11.920 --> 31:15.080
<i>A little more and you'll forget me</i>

31:15.160 --> 31:17.400
<i>Without you, I don't exist</i>

31:17.480 --> 31:20.880
<i>Come with me, you can have it</i>

31:22.080 --> 31:24.280
<i>I can give you everything you want</i>

31:24.360 --> 31:27.400
<i>Let's take a ride, let's go to the party</i>

31:27.480 --> 31:29.960
<i>It's the same bet, give me an answer</i>

31:30.040 --> 31:31.720
<i>I know you can do it</i>

31:32.880 --> 31:34.960
<i>I dream of trying, but I don't</i>

31:35.040 --> 31:39.280
<i>I know you call me, but I…</i>
<i>I'm waiting but no</i>

31:39.360 --> 31:42.600
<i>I'm speechless because I</i>

31:43.680 --> 31:44.720
<i>I know without you</i>…

31:44.800 --> 31:46.360
So the squirrel's in the trunk?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.240
<i>A little more and you'll forget me…</i>

31:48.320 --> 31:49.880
Noda is my guy.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.200
You already have many guys.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.880
Don't even think
about continuing with the messages.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.360
Excuse me.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.000
<i>I miss you</i>

32:00.080 --> 32:02.040
<i>Because I love you</i>

32:02.120 --> 32:04.240
<i>I will be your safeguard</i>

32:05.600 --> 32:08.360
<i>Here, it's for you, it's happening now</i>

32:08.440 --> 32:11.080
<i>This isn't the time to go crazy</i>

32:11.160 --> 32:13.480
This sucks. See what happened to my phone?

32:13.560 --> 32:16.680
<i>Can't you see I'm different now?</i>

32:16.760 --> 32:19.040
<i>Without you, I can't do any more</i>

32:19.120 --> 32:21.760
<i>I can't do any more, you'll forget me</i>

32:21.840 --> 32:24.560
<i>Without you, I don't exist</i>

32:24.640 --> 32:27.240
<i>Come with me, you can have it</i>

32:27.320 --> 32:29.800
<i>Without you, I can't do any more</i>

32:29.880 --> 32:32.440
<i>I can't do any more, you'll forget me</i>

32:36.320 --> 32:37.640
What happened?

32:38.480 --> 32:39.520
What happened?

32:39.600 --> 32:41.200
Stay calm, guys.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.360
We'll go see what happened.

32:44.000 --> 32:44.960
Charlie!

32:45.040 --> 32:48.240
Luz, please, go see
if anything's fried behind the bar.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.400
Should we go? Yes, please.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.440
Nothing's wrong. It's just a short.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.240
We'll fix it in five minutes.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.720
Come back, please!

32:58.800 --> 33:01.360
It was just an electrical short.
We're gonna fix it.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.560
Please, guys, stay.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.320
Stay. The night is great,
and it's gonna get better.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.360
Please. Come on.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.040
It was just an electrical short.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.080
One of the letters in the sign
short-circuited.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.640
-I'll fix it now.
-Okay.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.280
And this is how Sky Vibes starts and fails
in a matter of hours.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.800
It seems like it wasn't
a good day for either of us.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.280
Yours will get better with more training.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.120
I don't think we can fix this.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.640
Cheer up.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.880
When you fall,
all you can do is get back up.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.600
Seems your outing with Julián
had an effect on you.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.040
You guys are the best team ever.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.920
Thanks for everything.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.240
See? I told you
the lights would come back on.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.120
I was hoping Sky Vibes would work.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.200
Relax, Luz. It could've been worse.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.640
It already is worse.
We're not gonna be able to pay the debt.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.000
What debt?

34:36.320 --> 34:38.960
