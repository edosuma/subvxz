WEBVTT

00:04.296 --> 00:05.798
Previously on "Power"...

00:05.964 --> 00:08.324
- I'd be glad to have you on the team.
- It's only temporary

00:08.349 --> 00:11.649
until Milan is ready to move again.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.482
You give me
the identity of Ghost,

00:15.641 --> 00:17.761
and you and I will never
have to see each other again.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.070
- Transfer papers for Ruiz?
- No, Felipe Lobos.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.733
Thomas, I will be able
to spread my wings again,

00:23.899 --> 00:27.403
but before that happens,
I need your help opening the cage.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.116
- What did you do?
- The Jamaicans.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.371
- No!
- You didn't do it,

00:30.531 --> 00:31.623
so I hired them myself.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.126
- Who's the target?
- James St. Patrick.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.162
James, go. We got this.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.257
- What happened?
- It was Holly.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.717
Lobos hired me to kill you,
said he'd do her...

00:46.880 --> 00:49.975
Her and me if I didn't,
but I still didn't do it.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.682
We got to kill Lobos... together.

00:52.844 --> 00:53.936

Tommy, you slept out here, man?

03:02.766 --> 03:05.690
- I'm all right.
- Grab the keys, brother.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.105
Come on, buddy, I got you.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.108
Get the keys.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.618
Tommy, you just had them
downstairs, man.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.751
- I know that I got them somewhere.
- Check your pant pocket.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.669
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.898
I'll put a pot of coffee on.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.778
We got work to do.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.523
Come on, buddy.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.652
We should be transporting Lobos
in an armored tank.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.215
The Jimenez have shown they're
not afraid to strike on U.S. territory,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.492
so what's to stop them now?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.178
Jerry, the Jimenez think
Lobos is dead.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.712
Hardly anyone outside of
this room knows he's alive.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.215
A large transport will only
call attention to itself.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.693
- So what's the other option?
- We stay off the main roads,

04:10.718 --> 04:13.553
keep the move as quiet
and inconspicuous as possible.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.339
Is there a civilian vehicle
we could use?

04:15.505 --> 04:17.849
- A civilian vehicle?
- Yeah, the Bureau of Prisons

04:18.007 --> 04:20.601
has an undercover van modified
for prisoner transport.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.014
The rear conceals the prisoner
and our personnel.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.854
Lobos exits our facility
confidentially.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.360
He wears a GPS tracker
the entire operation.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.270
So we would know
where he is at all times?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.439
Yeah, we can track him
from this office.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.574
How's that sit with you, Donovan?

04:36.777 --> 04:40.202
If we're doing this low-key, I need men
I know I can trust on the ground.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.580
No offense.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.414
Agent Knox,
get the fellas ready.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.203
- I want you to run point.
- Yes, sir.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.849
- I'll handle it.
- Then it's settled.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.006
Let's get started.

05:01.384 --> 05:05.059
I handled the coordination with Anglin's
people at the BOP and the FBI.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.896
Everyone will monitor the transfer
from our conference room.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.436
In a way, I can't believe it.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.071
The task force is almost over.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.652
We transfer Lobos to D.C.,
and this is all behind us, right?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.616
All behind us.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.341
Hugo's got a crew
I'ma hook up with,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.427
and I don't know how many guys.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.180
He's not what
you'd call a communicator.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.105
So you link up
with Hugo's crew as planned.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.273
I'll help ambush them,
take over the prison break.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.658
Lobos won't know what hit him.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.117
Yeah, well, we got to be
off the grid all day.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.439
I mean, Kate'll lie for me
in exchange for enough coke.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.637
What you gonna do about an alibi?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.085
I hear you're living
with Angela now.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.051
Karen. I could use Karen.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.966
You already got a side bitch
on your side bitch?

06:23.133 --> 06:25.894
No, Tommy, Karen's an investor,
who's got a property up on the Hudson.

06:26.056 --> 06:29.416
If I stay there overnight, then I can just
tell Angela I was away on a business trip.

06:29.441 --> 06:30.140
Perfect.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.027
Nothing suspicious
about Lobos going missing

06:32.183 --> 06:33.983
on the exact day
you happen to be out of town.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.988
Tommy, you listening?
Angela will believe me.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.241
You're so fucking sure about that.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.965
One second.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.008
- What's up, Tasha? You good?
- What's up? I'm good.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.927
And where the hell is Holly?
I've been texting your girl all morning.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.312
- What the...
- Hey, T.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.731
- I thought you two weren't talking.
- We worked some shit out.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.022
- Overnight.
- Yeah.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.408
- What the hell is going on?
- Thing is...

07:21.566 --> 07:23.864
- we got to do something real big, T.
- Yo, yo, yo, Tommy.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.325
- We don't need to involve her.
- You got a better idea?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.958
- We need her, Ghost.
- Need me for what?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.716
- Hey.
- Dean.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.798
- How's Tariq?
- Tariq's fine.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.384
Three men were killed
right in front of you.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.884
He didn't see any of it.
Look, I appreciate what you did.

07:47.050 --> 07:51.226
I really do, but I gave you explicit
instructions not to follow me.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.937
Well, I had a hunch,
and it paid off.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.443
You and your son are alive
because of it.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.820
And I appreciate it, once again.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.949
Whoever tried to kill you won't stop
because we thwarted one attempt.

08:02.107 --> 08:05.452
Now, you know who it was,
and you know why they tried to hurt you.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.408
If it happens again,
I won't have a choice.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.073
- I'll have to go to the authorities.
- It won't happen again.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.493
So you plan to handle it
on your own?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.253
Listen, Dean.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.424
My plan is to not share
my plan with you.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.715
Do not follow me again. Clear?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.968
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.010
- Karen Bassett's here to see you.
- It's all good. We're done here.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.678
- Hello, James.
- Hey, Karen.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.938
- Thanks for coming in.
- Pleasure.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.940
What did you want to talk about?

08:36.099 --> 08:38.272
I just wanted to ask you

08:38.434 --> 08:41.109
if you were willing to move
our special meeting tomorrow

08:41.270 --> 08:43.273
- to the Odette on the Hudson.
- Okay.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.200
I just thought maybe
I could spend the night,

08:45.225 --> 08:48.783
learn the Bassett experience
from the inside out, you know?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.664
Understand your system
and the way it works and...

08:51.823 --> 08:55.293
I don't know,
while I finalize my ideas.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.705
- You're taking this seriously.
- I have to.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.215
I'm always looking
towards the future.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.920
Aren't you?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.466
No phones.
We're fucked if we got phones.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.385
You know they can track that shit
even if it's off.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.226
Okay, we ditch the phones
for the day.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.562
I'm surprised that you could be
disconnected from the club for that long.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.477
- Tommy...
- Tommy, can you please

09:20.643 --> 09:22.816
use this before you slice
your hand open?

09:22.979 --> 09:25.698
You know what, why don't I use this
before I slice my hand?

09:26.775 --> 09:29.153
That shit works.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.865
Get out of here.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.795
So Kate's gonna be his alibi?
Why not Holly?

09:39.996 --> 09:42.590
Holly's a bad idea, Tash.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.592
What happened? They break up?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.429
She told him about the baby.
He fucked it up, right?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.343
That's why he called you.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.854
He didn't say much.
He didn't want to talk about it.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.314
She's definitely
not gonna keep it now.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.990
I feel bad.
I told her to tell him.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.527
No wonder she's not
texting me back.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.195
Look, Tash,
can he crash here tonight?

10:12.362 --> 10:15.082
If he leaves, I'm afraid we're gonna
find him toasting to the sunrise

10:15.107 --> 10:16.575
at O'Malley's, you know this.

10:16.734 --> 10:17.993
All right? Thank you.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.787
I got to go. Running late.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.170
Angela expecting you?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.514
Part of the plan, Tasha.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.259
All part of the plan.
Good night, T.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.889
- Good night, Tommy.
- Night, Ghost.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.605
Hey, Tash, got any more food?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.735
Usual shit, Ghost!

10:44.894 --> 10:46.521
Leaving me with the mess.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.690
Tasha.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.243
Hey.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.953
Hey.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.245
Going somewhere?

11:01.411 --> 11:04.255
Remember that pitch meeting
I had with Karen Bassett?

11:04.414 --> 11:07.088
Well, she invited me to spend
tomorrow night at her hotel

11:07.250 --> 11:09.423
so I could learn the lay of the land.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.338
Spend the night
for a pitch meeting?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.807
You should come.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.099
I would love to.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.607
But not tomorrow.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.778
I've got a big day at work,
and that is all I can say.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.912
<i>Okay.</i>

11:38.281 --> 11:41.410
Well, I'll say this.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.795
When the deal happens
with Karen Bassett-

11:44.954 --> 11:45.955
and it will...

11:46.122 --> 11:48.966
You and I, Miss Thing,

11:49.125 --> 11:52.425
we're gonna be jet-setting
all over this big wide world.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.718
London, Paris, even Tokyo.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.978
You know what?

12:01.137 --> 12:03.435
I'll let you be my general counsel.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.027
That's a completely different
kind of law, Jamie.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.486
But you gonna learn.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.525
Am I.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.700
You're gonna learn that we're gonna
be in the clubs at night.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.285
We're gonna be sleeping
during the day.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.909
And in between...

12:24.494 --> 12:26.588
Right,

12:26.746 --> 12:29.169
like we would ever take
a break to sleep.

- You're gonna break the table.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.030
Yeah, I'm gonna break something.

14:16.084 --> 14:18.191
Ain't gon' be the goddamn table.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.300
Mr. St. Patrick, welcome.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.539
- Welcome, sir.
- All right.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.005
- Thank you.
- There you go.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.013
Good.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.804
- This place is beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.144
All right, remember we need to act
like husband and wife now, all right?

14:51.307 --> 14:53.901
- All right.
- Typical Ghost.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.734
Your black ass had to go
and put a damper on it?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.405
How the fuck am I supposed
to work with these two morons

15:16.430 --> 15:19.149
- if they don't speak English?
- I talk English.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.262
School of Americas.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.015
So you brought me two thugs
that torture farmers.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.019
Tell me, Hugo, what's the plan?

15:29.887 --> 15:32.356
Tommy, the transport

15:32.515 --> 15:34.688
will be most vulnerable...

15:35.643 --> 15:37.361
here at the bend in the road.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.525
What the fuck's he doing?

15:42.692 --> 15:44.535
The GPS.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.196
'Cause that explains it.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.285
Let's just get this over with.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.042
Heads up, boys. Here we go.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.640
- Nice to see you again.
- I know you.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.721
- Where's his tracker?
- Left ankle.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.307
I wanted white,
but they said it wasn't available.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.393
Hey, it was.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.808
You probably checked online, right?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.022
Here you go. Watch your head.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.774
Confirm we have Lobos
on the move.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.663
Copy that, Agent Knox.
Keep this channel open.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.404
Coming!

17:09.819 --> 17:11.696
You must be Mrs. St. Patrick.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.992
And you must be Miss Bassett.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.502
Call me Tasha.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.789
- James has said so much about you.
- Call me Karen.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.515
L just wanted to come by,
make sure that everything was in order.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.041
It's fantastic.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.086
You pulled out all the stops.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.220
It's nice to have a night
away from the kids.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.850
James is in the shower.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.488
Do you want him to call
when he's out?

17:32.513 --> 17:34.178
No. No, I'll talk to him
in the morning.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.643
Please, with our compliments.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.308
Thank you.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.818
Come on in.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.190
Thank you.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.183
Coming.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.143
Go.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.859
How lucky am I?

18:30.026 --> 18:32.529
No, luck had nothing to do with it.

18:32.695 --> 18:33.787
- No?
- Nope.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.823
I requested this here seat.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.587
Easy.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.999
Will you massage my calves?

18:50.713 --> 18:54.217
I just don't get it.
Is it really that easy?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.056
- What?
- What?

18:56.218 --> 18:59.722
One primera flips,
and you fall down like a domino?

18:59.889 --> 19:02.062
Damn.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.068
<i>L</i> Pity you.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.604
I really pity you.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.990
Really? I pity you.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.401
They'll be putting you away
for a very, very long time.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.738
And your old friend Ruiz,

19:14.904 --> 19:18.078
- James St. Patrick.
- Never heard of him.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.067
- I'm so bored.
- Me, too.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.992
We got a situation here!
Code Delta! Code Delta!

19:53.150 --> 19:55.448
Knox, What's going on?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.622
- Here's where I get off.
- Back up. Back up! Back up!

20:02.785 --> 20:04.833
We need support now!

20:04.995 --> 20:07.919
I need assistance on route one.
Prisoner escape in progress.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.888
Got your six!

20:17.717 --> 20:19.219
Fuck!

20:19.385 --> 20:21.103
Shots fired!
We need support now!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.723
Cover the front!

20:31.564 --> 20:33.566
- Do you copy?
- Officer down! Officer down!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.485
Where's the fucking back-up?

20:36.318 --> 20:37.319
Fuck.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.331
Going front!

20:43.951 --> 20:45.999
We need some help!

20:52.835 --> 20:54.337
What the fuck do we do?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.176
We're lawyers, Angela.
What can we do?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.761
Agent Knox, air assistance is en route.
Do you copy?

20:58.924 --> 21:02.019
- I need eyes on Agent Knox.
- It's Sandoval. Do you copy?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.780
I'm back.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.537
Qué pasa, Jefe?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.708
You got any other trackers on you?

21:24.867 --> 21:27.211
No.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.377
- Let's do it!
- Vémonos, Jefe!

21:33.209 --> 21:35.052
Okay, let's move. Move, move!

21:35.211 --> 21:37.259
Vémonos!

21:37.421 --> 21:40.550
- Do you copy? Knox?
- Let's go.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.220
- What do you want to do about him?
- Fuck him.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.765
He knew the risks.
I love this black-on-black.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.355
You look like a ninja.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.735
Let's get to work, people.
Let's get any info we can.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.746
Tomás, hey? Bravo.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.457
You executed the plan perfectly.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.082
Yo, yo, yo. This motherfucker.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.593
Yo, we got to speak English.
We a team here.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.753
English?

22:17.920 --> 22:20.673
- Where are you going?
- Chill, B.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.559
We just got to ditch
the eye in the sky.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.445
This is not the plan.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.073
I call Hugo.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.706
That's odd.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.622
So's this.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.588
Did you really think that I didn't know
that you was just gonna drop me

22:55.613 --> 22:58.207
when this was all over?

23:01.255 --> 23:03.474
Hola, Jefe.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.459
Seriously, bitch,
ain't you got a job?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.632
"Love you, Angie."

24:31.887 --> 24:34.436
Yes, hello.
I need a shoeshine for my husband.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.100
He's sleeping.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.644
I'd like it back in about 20 minutes,
before he wakes up.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.858
Okay, great.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.675
Damn it, Ghost.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.488
Out.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.949
How'd you seduce him
away from me?

25:31.113 --> 25:34.367
The dog always goes back
to the master?

25:34.533 --> 25:37.127
Unless you cut
the dog's fucking throat.

25:37.286 --> 25:40.381
Tommy! Tommy!

25:40.539 --> 25:42.212
Tommy, come on, man.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.580
You should've seen what
his fucking goon did to Bell.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.547
He's still got to fucking walk.
Let's get him up.

25:47.572 --> 25:48.639
Come on.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.220
You think you're gonna
fucking kill me

25:51.383 --> 25:53.681
and live to talk about it?

25:53.844 --> 25:56.814
I'm gonna erase
your fucking bloodline.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.691
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Make you extinct!

26:04.980 --> 26:06.448
Hey.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.201
You all right?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.078
Fine.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.537
Just worried about Greg,
like we all are.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.872
I'm surprised
you're this worked up, Valdes.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.003
You guys had some serious beef.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.256
That doesn't mean I wanted
this to happen to him.

26:27.044 --> 26:30.093
L just wish I could tell him
I was sorry.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.263
What the hell is that?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.846
- Greg's okay!
- What?

26:37.012 --> 26:39.686
- Thank God you were wearing a vest.
- Take it easy?

26:39.848 --> 26:41.441
It's fine.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.853
- Thank God.
- Let's take a walk.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.488
Come on. Take it easy. Come on.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.533
He's gonna betray you.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.542
There's still time.

27:00.369 --> 27:01.746
Shut your fucking mouth.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.381
And this plan,
walking me through this muck,

27:04.540 --> 27:06.713
you're leaving evidence everywhere.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.053
One of you's gonna get caught,
don't you think?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.759
Not gonna betray you?

27:11.922 --> 27:13.890
He's done it once before.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.551
He's betrayed both of us.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.095
I know why you want out,
Fantasma,

27:18.262 --> 27:19.935
but now you have to make a choice.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.974
Tommy, do you think
he's gonna choose you?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.563
Well, he ain't choosing you.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.649
♪ Love is a wonderful thing ♪

27:26.812 --> 27:28.780
And she's lovely, Fantasma,
like an angel.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.239
Well, her name is Angela.
She's beautiful, independent, brave.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.824
And I heard she's got
a tight little pussy.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.157
- What about her?
- Come on, Ghost, we ain't there yet.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.076
What do you think?

27:41.243 --> 27:44.167
I organized my escape.

27:44.329 --> 27:48.300
I know every detail of
the government's plan to move me.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.586
Yeah, we know you got
a fucking rat on the inside.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.175
And when my "rat" on the inside

27:53.338 --> 27:55.466
realizes that I haven't made it
to my destination,

27:55.632 --> 27:58.306
he's gonna get Angela's
beautiful brown eyes, you know?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.428
He's gonna come out,
and he's gonna scoop them out

28:00.512 --> 28:02.435
and fuck it.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.646
- Call it off.
- No, are you serious?

28:04.808 --> 28:07.277
No, no, no. Not until I'm free.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.717
<i>Uni“ then, the chuck goes
flak-took, flak-Keck, tick-tack.</i>

28:09.742 --> 28:11.156
He's gonna fucking
kill Angela, man.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.443
Which you should've done
yourself before now.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.282
Fuck you.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.287
We gone too far.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.120
We gonna waste this motherfucker
and bury him so deep,

28:20.282 --> 28:21.955
no one'll ever find him.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.664
Hey, Tommy, why so brash?

28:23.827 --> 28:27.422
You think I'm foolish enough
to trust you blindly?

28:28.790 --> 28:32.966
Hugo's with your beautiful
little delicate white flower right now.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.632
Holly?

28:36.798 --> 28:39.142
You talking about Holly?

28:39.301 --> 28:42.931
And she's... she's gonna suffer.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.025
March.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.160
And then they were...
they were ready for it.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.523
They knew every detail
about the transfer... everything.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.332
What are you basing that on?

29:05.494 --> 29:08.168
- This feels like a smash and grab.
- No.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.046
I don't need a doctor.
No, no, no, I had a vest on.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.129
- Everything's fine.
- You took two to the chest,

29:14.253 --> 29:15.693
and you refuse to go
to the hospital.

29:15.718 --> 29:17.506
He's gonna look you over.
That's an order.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.313
I'm gonna need you
to unbutton your shirt.

29:19.338 --> 29:21.136
- What?
- Unbutton your shirt, please.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.979
Fuck.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.118
After I got popped,
they went straight...

29:31.228 --> 29:33.856
Deep breath, please.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.820
Deep breath again.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.370
After I got popped, they went
straight for Lobos's GPS tracker,

29:40.529 --> 29:42.531
rolled up with fucking bolt cutters,
ready for it,

29:42.698 --> 29:44.371
which means we've got
a big fucking leak.

29:44.533 --> 29:48.413
GPS trackers are standard operating
procedure with high-value prisoners.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.378
They were likely prepared for it
just in case.

29:50.403 --> 29:52.545
Right, Mike, they-they knew
exactly what van to hit,

29:52.708 --> 29:54.051
what route... Stop, man.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.552
- Okay, okay.
- What time.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.588
Which means it was
a fucking inside job.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.223
You're very lucky.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.383
I'm gonna need an MRI.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.693
They were right in front
of my eyes, man.

30:02.718 --> 30:03.860
- Right in front of me.
- Okay.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.028
We need to lock down this office...

30:05.053 --> 30:06.853
We're in the middle of
a clusterfuck as it is.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.772
The last thing
our department needs is a wild,

30:08.797 --> 30:10.601
unformulated accusation
about a leak.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.687
Main Justice would shit-can
every last one of us.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.969
You were just in a firefight.
Your adrenaline's pumping.

30:14.994 --> 30:18.280
Mike's right. Right now, we need
to be rational until we know more.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.661
First order of business...
find Lobos.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.667
They found the getaway car
and a second body.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.079
I'll be right back.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.677
I'm glad you're okay.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.339
We were all worried
that you were...

30:40.505 --> 30:42.382
gone.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.595
Good to have you back, Greg.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.751
Okay. Fuck.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.347
- Is this for me?
- Yeah, it's all for you.

31:26.510 --> 31:29.013
- I don't like these accommodations.
- Really?

31:29.179 --> 31:30.931
- No.
- I never had any complaints before.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.020
Turn around, Jefe.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.561
Sorry you don't get to paint
your watercolors.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.821
No acuarelas para ti, Jefe.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.616
Fantasma.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.078
Killing me doesn't save you.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.331
One day.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.537
You will find yourself
standing right here.

31:51.159 --> 31:55.505
God doesn't take men like us
peacefully while we sleep.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.717
And this is where your life ends.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.593
Nighty-night, Jefe.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.345
What the fuck?

32:02.504 --> 32:04.506
Is that a phone?
Ghost, we said no phones!

32:04.673 --> 32:05.899
I don't have a fucking phone.
Check his coat.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.604
- Yeah, I checked him for trackers.
- Well, fucking check him again.

32:08.629 --> 32:10.427
Come on, Tommy.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.607
Fuck.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.860
- Fuck.
- Smash it.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.191
- Fuck!
- Smash it!

32:19.354 --> 32:21.732
- Who was it? Who was it?
- How am I supposed to know?

32:21.898 --> 32:24.117
He destroyed it?

32:24.276 --> 32:27.356
Whoever has the number could be fucking
triangulating the cell tower now, man.

32:27.381 --> 32:28.701
And they could trace us here?

32:28.864 --> 32:30.537
Well, that fucks the plan.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.459
- Come on, we got to abort.
- No, no, no, no.

32:32.576 --> 32:33.953
No, no. We go forward.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.719
What is the point of being here
if they're sending a search party?

32:36.872 --> 32:38.432
I could've done him
back on the highway.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.586
No, we take him somewhere else,
and we Bin Laden his ass.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.719
We toss him in the ocean
so he's gone forever.

32:43.879 --> 32:44.880
You fucking said it.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.686
You said,
"We can't put a fucking fugitive

32:46.798 --> 32:49.597
in the back seat of a fucking Ford
driving like we going to picnic!"

32:49.759 --> 32:51.759
Come on, man,
we put a fucking bullet in his brain.

32:51.784 --> 32:52.763
- Think!
- I am thinking,

32:52.929 --> 32:54.602
and that phone fucks us good.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.391
God damn it!

33:00.729 --> 33:02.026
Fuck.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.837
Hey, Jack, it's Mike Sandoval.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.751
I need to call in a trap-and-trace
to a cell's last known tower number.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.274
You think he made it to the highway?

33:41.436 --> 33:43.359
How would he know
which way to go?

33:45.190 --> 33:47.350
All right, just like
back in the neighborhood, partner.

33:47.517 --> 33:49.477
If we gonna find this bastard,
we got to split up.

33:49.502 --> 33:51.120
Yeah, you're right.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.952
I'm gonna take this trail over here.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.537
You keep going down the path.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.580
Ghost!

34:37.742 --> 34:39.494
Ghost, where the fuck are you?!

34:59.848 --> 35:02.067
Don't do it.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.774
I'm not surprised.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.820
I would do the same.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.200
We leave a body,
there's gonna be a shitstorm.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.540
I need to end this now, Tommy.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.790
Okay, I guess
we're not negotiating this.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.422
You want to bury him?

35:30.503 --> 35:33.131
Carry his body back? No.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.175
We'll let the vultures have at him.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.228
Let's get out of here, brother.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.412
What are you gonna do about
your nosey security guard Dean?

35:57.238 --> 35:58.911
I need to get rid of him.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.634
I mean, I don't want
to kill him, but...

36:00.659 --> 36:02.415
Why not?

36:02.577 --> 36:05.296
Well, I might still need
the motherfucker.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.090
We're finally free, Tommy.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.265
We're finally fucking free, man.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.852
Me and you, man,
we got our whole lives back.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.277
Yeah.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.779
You get to start over.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.032
Start over?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.363
With what, Ghost?

36:34.526 --> 36:36.403
Nigga, I ain't got no connect.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.198
I ain't got no family.
I ain't got no...

36:42.867 --> 36:45.541
Hey, man, you'll meet
a new girl, you know?

36:45.704 --> 36:48.878
Better yet,
another lucky girl will meet you.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.673
Can't replace Holly.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.429
Come on.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.852
Man, we made a lot of money.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.812
You can do anything
you want to do.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.728
It's only one part of our lives
that's over, Tommy.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.317
We got our whole life ahead of us.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.734
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.497
And about Holly, man.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.839
I'm sorry.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.092
Sure.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.770
Have a good run?

37:48.892 --> 37:50.644
Yes.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.938
And that's what I told
the doorman.

37:55.565 --> 37:58.364
Well, I've been here,
holding down my end of the bargain.

37:58.526 --> 37:59.527
Good.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.287
This bitch is hooked on you.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.164
She been texting all damn day.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.960
Damn, Tash, sounds just like me.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.880
Yeah, well, I remember
how you used to talk to me.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.762
I should probably call her.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.977
We don't usually go this long
without talking.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.392
Okay, well, before you do,

38:30.558 --> 38:32.401
I just heard from Mama.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.813
Tariq tried to sneak out the house.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.659
When she caught him,
he talked back to her.

38:36.773 --> 38:39.242
You want to know why?

38:39.400 --> 38:42.324
- Because I'm not there.
- Because I ain't there.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.074
Lobos may be dead,
but your shit is slipping,

38:46.241 --> 38:47.743
and it's taking me out at the knees.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.029
Tasha, he's just adjusting
to the new situation, okay?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.422
That's all. The kid'll be fine.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.731
- God, I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.318
Everything okay? How was work?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.574
It was a rough day.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.656
What about you?

39:22.819 --> 39:25.698
This property is beautiful, baby.
You should see it.

39:27.156 --> 39:30.160
Could be a big endeavor,
riskiest thing I've ever done.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.794
When do you get home?

39:31.953 --> 39:35.708
Tomorrow, hopefully with good news,
so cross your fingers.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.633
Jamie, I love you.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.677
I love you, too, Angie.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.392
Have a good night,
all right, baby?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.526
Really, Tasha?

40:02.692 --> 40:04.740
Is it always that easy
to lie to someone you love?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.201
Jesus, I'm doing
what needs to be done, okay?

40:07.363 --> 40:09.206
It's part of the plan.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.208
- It's always like that with you.
- What?

40:11.367 --> 40:12.835
Necessity.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.042
What needs to be done.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.458
Which is why
I can't understand this.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.253
Our pre-nup says
that I get half if you want out.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.098
You ready to lose half?
'Cause I'll take it all.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.760
That money's for the kids, too.
I would never back out on that.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.929
- You know that.
- But what if you're in prison?

40:32.680 --> 40:36.435
You think killing Lobos is
gonna make your dirt disappear?

40:38.019 --> 40:41.364
You think if she finds out you did this,
she's gonna cover for you?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.694
I think she's not gonna find out.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.173
The only way she finds out is if you tell
her, Tasha, and you're not gonna tell her.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.166
You know why?
Because you're an accomplice.

41:08.800 --> 41:13.306
I already signed them,
because I am so done with your ass.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.574
Tasha, this is
what it looks like,

41:24.732 --> 41:26.905
moving forward for us, all right?

41:27.068 --> 41:29.537
No more threats.
Nobody coming after...

41:30.196 --> 41:32.073
me, you, the kids.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.208
No more guns
in the house or guards.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.187
I'm fucking keeping the family safe.
That's what I'm doing.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.886
And some day,
you're gonna appreciate it.

41:38.911 --> 41:41.005
I appreciate it.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.299
Don't even try it.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.515
And I want my own car
for the trip home tomorrow.

41:49.674 --> 41:51.426
Good night.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.243
Hey, hey. Hey-

42:57.325 --> 42:59.168
I brought you your ring.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.717
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.348
You're expected.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.009
- James.
- Karen.

43:15.176 --> 43:16.496
- Tasha, hello.
- Hi, how are you?

43:16.552 --> 43:19.351
- This is my father.
- It's an honor, Mr. Bassett.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.634
I have a tremendous amount of
respect for your empire.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.229
No, call me Horatio.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.872
From what I hear, you're well
on your way to building your own.

43:25.897 --> 43:28.774
We try. Speaking of "we,"
this is my lovely wife, Tasha.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.068
Hi, how are you?
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

43:31.234 --> 43:33.282
Tasha, are you joining us
for brunch?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.412
I'm so flattered, but, no, l...

43:35.571 --> 43:37.824
I need to get home
and be with the kids.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.288
But the hotel was wonderful.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.919
Thank you, really.

43:42.078 --> 43:43.558
Have a good meeting.
Good luck, James.

43:43.583 --> 43:44.881
Give me a second.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.383
All right, baby,
get home safe, okay?

43:47.542 --> 43:50.170
Good-bye... Ghost.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.064
Someone in this office
gave us up.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.396
- Or someone in the BOP.
- Nope.

44:04.559 --> 44:05.731
Or Lobos himself.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.973
I mean, you know how common
burner phones are inside.

44:07.998 --> 44:09.772
Fuck.

44:09.939 --> 44:12.909
Please, please tell me this
isn't about Valdes.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.904
Who else would it be?

44:17.738 --> 44:21.163
We were all pretty shaken up
when we thought you bought it.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.748
Oh, Jesus, thanks.
That's sweet, Saxe.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.083
Shut up.

44:25.246 --> 44:27.089
Like I said,
we were all spooked,

44:27.248 --> 44:31.003
but Valdes was
practically crying

44:31.169 --> 44:34.514
like a... human woman.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.009
- For effect.
- Looked pretty real to me.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.975
- You guys back in the sack?
- No.

44:41.137 --> 44:42.764
Well, then,
now that you're wounded,

44:42.930 --> 44:44.970
I'm thinking you might be able
to get back in there.

44:45.016 --> 44:48.441
Like a Purple Heart,
but, you know, pussy.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.534
- Hey.
- Dean, thanks for coming in.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.198
Pleasure.

45:00.364 --> 45:03.459
Look, I called you down to let you know
that I no longer need your services.

45:05.453 --> 45:08.957
In my experience, when you save
the life of a man and that of his son,

45:09.123 --> 45:12.377
they keep you close.
What's different about this situation?

45:13.711 --> 45:16.590
I don't have to explain myself to you,
first of all.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.765
You finally killed Lobos.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.813
What'd you say?

45:45.576 --> 45:47.874
What language is that?

45:48.037 --> 45:50.506
Wait, how do you know the code?

45:50.665 --> 45:54.465
You have many questions, and tell me,
which is right question to begin with?

45:55.920 --> 45:59.595
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Wrong. Who are you, and do I know?

45:59.757 --> 46:03.011
Yes, I do, Jamie St. Patrick.

46:03.177 --> 46:06.397
Look, Ghost.

46:06.555 --> 46:08.683
I know who you are.

46:08.849 --> 46:11.193
Club owner, father,

46:11.352 --> 46:15.152
adulterer, drug dealer...

46:15.856 --> 46:18.359
thief.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.278
Did you get my message?

46:20.444 --> 46:22.993
Do you know
what you have taken from me?

46:29.620 --> 46:31.088
You're Serbian,

46:31.247 --> 46:33.215
and this has to do
with Vladimir and his crew.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.547
And the shipment that
you and Tommy intercepted

46:35.710 --> 46:38.634
and left for the police,

46:38.796 --> 46:40.719
my drugs.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.809
Sit.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.652
Milan.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.031
Nice to meet you.

47:09.702 --> 47:12.455
And all this time...

47:13.539 --> 47:15.416
you were working for me.

47:15.583 --> 47:19.929
You were so concerned with Lobos
that you neglected me.

47:20.087 --> 47:21.930
It's very selfish.

47:22.089 --> 47:24.763
You took from me what was mine.

47:24.925 --> 47:28.429
- You owe me, Ghost.
- You got close to me.

47:28.596 --> 47:31.145
You hired your fucking men
to protect me,

47:31.307 --> 47:32.604
but you're not gonna kill me.

47:32.767 --> 47:34.360
'Cause you have value,
you and Tommy,

47:34.518 --> 47:37.897
and I need you to go to work for me
to replace what you have stolen.

47:41.484 --> 47:43.703
Why now, Milan?

47:43.861 --> 47:46.159
I got nothing left.

47:46.322 --> 47:48.165
I got no network.
I got no supplies.

47:48.324 --> 47:51.453
- I'm out of the fucking game.
- I know how you think.

47:52.328 --> 47:55.207
You will stall and deal with me
like you did Lobos,

47:55.373 --> 47:59.628
but first, remember,
my security team is in your clubs.

47:59.794 --> 48:02.968
We know your home, your family,

48:03.130 --> 48:04.973
Angela.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.306
You can kill me,
but it is of no consequence,

48:11.472 --> 48:13.349
'cause I am not Lobos,
and my organization

48:13.516 --> 48:15.234
does not die with me.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.896
Call Tommy and tell him

48:18.062 --> 48:20.064
it's time to go back to work.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.983
Do not worry.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.742
You are very safe.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.363
For now.

48:38.582 --> 48:40.926
I did hear you say "Milan," right?

48:41.794 --> 48:43.387
The motherfucker who eats people?

48:43.546 --> 48:45.219
For sure?

48:45.381 --> 48:47.759
Yo, he's been working for you
this whole time?

48:49.009 --> 48:51.228
Fuck, Ghost,
where's your head at?

48:51.387 --> 48:53.685
It was seamless, man.
He didn't miss a fucking beat.

48:54.515 --> 48:57.439
And we just took out
one sicko yesterday.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.525
I'm not emotionally prepared
to work for another psychopath.

49:00.688 --> 49:03.332
Okay, brother, look, I hear you.
That's why we fucking need to kill him.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.609
- Kill him?
- Yeah, kill him.

49:04.775 --> 49:05.867
You want to kill Milan?

49:06.026 --> 49:07.586
You know anything about him
or his crew?

49:07.611 --> 49:08.529
No.

49:08.696 --> 49:10.243
How about his turf,
his organization?

49:10.406 --> 49:11.407
No. Fuck.

49:11.574 --> 49:13.454
I mean, he's been working for you
for this long?

49:13.617 --> 49:15.697
I bet you don't even know
what kind of car he drives.

49:15.722 --> 49:17.580
Tommy, we are lucky
to be alive, man.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.765
We're sitting here fucking talking,
and the only reason we're not dead

49:19.790 --> 49:21.792
- is because he needs us.
- No, you are lucky.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.759
I'm not the motherfucker
that killed Vladimir.

49:23.784 --> 49:25.784
Fuck Vladimir.
He don't give a fuck about Vladimir.

49:25.809 --> 49:27.742
He told me himself.
Listen to me, man.

49:28.382 --> 49:30.760
He's talking about his shipment,
all right?

49:32.553 --> 49:34.897
That motherfucker said
we're going back to work for him

49:35.055 --> 49:36.147
to pay him back.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.730
- You want to get back to hustling?
- I have to.

49:38.893 --> 49:41.453
How exactly are you planning on
pulling it off living with a Fed?

49:41.562 --> 49:46.068
You're gonna have to wake up
with her every morning...

49:48.277 --> 49:49.745
and lie to her.

49:49.904 --> 49:53.124
Lie to her all goddamn clay.
Lie to her every night.

49:53.282 --> 49:55.330
It's never gonna fucking work.

49:55.493 --> 49:56.995
So you're saying I can't pull it off?

49:57.161 --> 50:00.040
No, she took you back because
she thought that you was clean.

50:00.915 --> 50:03.075
As soon as she finds out
that you got back in the game,

50:03.125 --> 50:05.594
- she gonna turn you in.
- No, she won't.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.972
No, but that's not even
your big fucking problem.

50:08.130 --> 50:11.805
Your big fucking problem
is that she's your soft spot.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.344
She's your weakness.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.354
They can go on after her to get to you.

50:28.609 --> 50:30.782
- Dean knows everything about me.
- Milan.

50:32.446 --> 50:35.950
He knows everything about me, which
means he can get to my family, Tommy.

50:36.116 --> 50:38.869
He can make Tasha and the kids
fucking target practice.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.959
Tasha got a head on a swivel.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.209
She a motherfucking G.
She got your kids on lock.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.794
Now, but Angela, she's a liability.

50:46.961 --> 50:50.716
You can't even tell her
that the Serbians are after her.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.976
Now, I think that we should've killed
that bitch a long time ago,

50:54.134 --> 50:57.764
but we didn't, so here we are.

50:58.347 --> 51:01.851
She either catches you,
puts you in jail,

51:02.017 --> 51:05.988
or she don't but Milan catches her.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.696
Yeah.

51:15.197 --> 51:17.620
But if you take her out...

51:20.035 --> 51:22.254
you could make sure
that she don't suffer.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.135
'Cause if Milan gets a hold of her...

51:32.590 --> 51:34.684
I can't believe I'm saying this.

51:35.342 --> 51:38.937
But if everything that Vladimir
told me about Milan is true...

51:40.931 --> 51:42.808
My God.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.653
Even I don't think
Angela deserves that.

51:55.362 --> 51:56.989
I'll handle it.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.294
I'll be here when you get back.

52:12.671 --> 52:14.969
Finally, you're home.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.512
Hey, baby-

52:21.889 --> 52:23.516
How was your day?

52:26.268 --> 52:27.520
<i>Okay.</i>

52:29.563 --> 52:31.861
You don't seem okay.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.570
And I'm certainly not okay.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.740
Tell me about that...

52:39.907 --> 52:43.332
you know, that part of the future
where we fly around the world.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.920
That'll make us feel better.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.466
Jamie, what's wrong?

53:01.595 --> 53:03.939
Our future together,
flying around the world,

53:04.098 --> 53:05.975
it's not gonna happen, baby.

53:12.147 --> 53:14.241
Something went wrong with Karen?

53:16.193 --> 53:18.571
Something's wrong.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.241
Been wrong.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.294
I was just too out of it to see.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.173
You know, Angie,
yesterday Tariq ran away.

53:30.332 --> 53:33.757
He's back now,
but I wasn't there.

53:35.087 --> 53:38.466
At some point, my kids
have to be what's most important.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.101
As they should be.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.897
Jamie, I've never asked you to choose
between your kids and me.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.238
What are you saying?

53:52.396 --> 53:54.899
You know what I'm saying.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.486
You separated from Tasha.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.905
- I saw the papers.
- And now I know that was a mistake.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.626
A mistake?

54:08.412 --> 54:09.834
You love me.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.920
I know you do. You told me so.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.335
And-and I meant it, you know?
When I said it, I meant it.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.346
I wanted to love you.
I wanted to dream.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.678
Why are you doing this?

54:20.841 --> 54:23.845
But that was our 15-year-old dream.
Maybe we've outgrown that dream.

54:24.011 --> 54:27.060
Now, you love me, this me
standing here right now

54:27.222 --> 54:29.520
asking you?

54:29.683 --> 54:32.723
Not the version of me you put together
in your head 20 years ago but this me.

54:32.853 --> 54:35.072
- You love this me?
- Yes, I love you.

54:35.230 --> 54:37.028
You know that.

54:37.191 --> 54:39.694
Tariq running away
means that all of a sudden

54:39.860 --> 54:41.737
our feelings for each other
aren't real?

54:43.280 --> 54:45.760
- This doesn't make sense.
- Tariq running away made me realize

54:45.785 --> 54:48.959
what I have to lose, okay,
in the real world, not in a fantasy world.

54:51.914 --> 54:55.885
Angela, do you really trust
your 15-year-old self

54:56.043 --> 54:58.387
to make decisions
for the rest of your life?

54:58.545 --> 55:01.549
I trust the way I feel about you,

55:01.715 --> 55:04.389
the way I've always felt about you.

55:04.551 --> 55:06.724
Everything I've done for you,

55:06.887 --> 55:09.766
I've done for us,
and I would do it again.

55:10.891 --> 55:12.985
Angie, if we were meant
to be together,

55:13.143 --> 55:15.396
you think it would be this hard?

55:15.562 --> 55:18.065
I came into the club, didn't I?

55:18.232 --> 55:20.326
Wasn't that meant to be?

55:24.404 --> 55:27.328
It's the right decision, okay?

55:27.491 --> 55:29.118
Obviously,
you don't see that now,

55:29.284 --> 55:31.127
but I know one day you will.

55:31.286 --> 55:32.583
Take care of yourself.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.498
There's something
you're not telling me.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.627
What do you want me to tell you?

55:38.794 --> 55:40.467
The truth.

55:40.629 --> 55:42.927
Tell me the truth.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.428
We can't be together, Angie.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.021
It's the right decision.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.601
Jamie, I love you.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.608
I know.

55:57.521 --> 55:59.444
