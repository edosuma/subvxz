00:34.234 --> 00:37.294
All right, everybody! Who likes money?

00:37.404 --> 00:38.530
I do, honey.

00:38.638 --> 00:43.268
Good, then I need you to go down
to the VFW and collect this much.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.402
Those vets are three months behind
on their propane bill.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.041
[groaning]

00:48.882 --> 00:51.976
The VFW? Those guys are war heroes.

00:52.118 --> 00:56.054
Sending a Joe Jack to hit them up
for money is, well, kind of an insult.

00:56.156 --> 00:59.353
At least send an Enrique or a Roger Sack.

00:59.459 --> 01:04.123
Hank, I am tired of talking about this.
You get me that money yourself!

01:04.230 --> 01:08.030
The mother of my bastard
is all over me for more child support.

01:08.134 --> 01:11.661
Well, I understand.
I have a boy of my own.

01:14.707 --> 01:17.540
(Cotton) A-N-Z-l-O.

01:18.311 --> 01:21.337
-Anzio!
-You can't use that. I challenge.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.884
What? Challenge? The Battle of Anzio.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.646
Thirtieth day of January, 1944.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.551
We caught the Krauts
with their pants down...

01:29.656 --> 01:31.521
and their schnitzel exposed.

01:31.624 --> 01:34.787
We'd taken the beach by noon,
the town by nightfall.

01:34.894 --> 01:39.354
I can still taste the Chianti
out of that sigiora 's navel.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.993
All right, it's a proper noun,
but, damn it, I'll allow it!

01:43.536 --> 01:45.436
God, she was a piece.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.536
Triple word score. Forty-two points.

01:48.641 --> 01:49.608
[clearing throat]

01:50.376 --> 01:51.400
Hey, Dad?

01:52.245 --> 01:54.110
To quote Mr. Strickland...

01:54.214 --> 01:57.240
I don't mean to be a propane in the butt...

01:57.350 --> 01:58.317
[tittering]

01:58.418 --> 01:59.385
but...

02:00.286 --> 02:03.983
you owe $416.29...

02:04.090 --> 02:05.648
on your propane bill.

02:05.758 --> 02:08.556
I think I can get the $5 late fee waived.

02:08.695 --> 02:13.325
I'm sorry, I must have dropped that money
somewhere in the Philippines...

02:13.433 --> 02:15.697
fighting for your freedom,
you damn draft-dodger!

02:15.802 --> 02:16.894
You mean to tell me...

02:17.003 --> 02:19.733
that this bloodsucking ganef
never served his country?

02:19.839 --> 02:23.775
Four-F.
Got out on account of his narrow urethra!

02:23.877 --> 02:24.935
[sighs]

02:25.044 --> 02:27.706
The only uniform he ever wore
was the Boy Scouts.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.679
I made it to Eagle Scout.

02:29.782 --> 02:32.307
And, Dad, you know the war was over.

02:32.418 --> 02:33.851
Besides, I tried to enlist...

02:33.953 --> 02:38.788
but the Army felt I wouldn't be able
to relieve myself efficiently under duress...

02:38.892 --> 02:40.450
especially in front of others.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.788
[all guffawing]

02:41.895 --> 02:45.422
-Look, I didn't come here to fight.
-Of course you didn't, you coward.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.023
We ain't got your money.
Take a look around.

02:48.134 --> 02:51.262
You see Fat Brooklyn, Cookie,
or Tommy-Gun Scanlan?

02:53.473 --> 02:54.667
-No.
-Dead!

02:54.774 --> 02:58.301
All dead. And dead men don't pay no dues.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.173
Now, get out of my sight!

03:00.280 --> 03:03.010
Come back tomorrow.
We's having a fundraiser.

03:03.650 --> 03:07.552
Let's do our shopping
before the Salvation Army invades.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.882
[giggling]

03:11.024 --> 03:13.322
I should get a medal for wit.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.689
And you know
what I would call that medal?

03:15.795 --> 03:17.387
I would call it the....

03:17.597 --> 03:19.326
[chuckling]

03:19.666 --> 03:20.860
I don't know.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.737
Hey, there's my dad.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.440
Get your war-hero memorabilia here!

03:29.542 --> 03:31.169
All items must go!

03:31.277 --> 03:34.246
Amuse your friends and thrill the ladies...

03:34.347 --> 03:37.942
with an authentic Nazi skull.
Priced to move.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.848
Dad, are you selling your medals?

03:39.953 --> 03:42.945
Yes, I am, you four-eyed Four-F-er.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.219
I should charge you $1.25
just for looking at them.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.920
But when I was kid,
you wouldn't even let me polish them.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.724
Well, it's sell the medals or lose the VFW.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.731
We can't pay the rent no more.

03:53.833 --> 03:58.702
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there's a twig boy eyeing Hitler's canoe.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.270
I'm prepared to offer $100 American
for the canoe...

04:03.376 --> 04:05.071
and don't try to haggle with me.

04:05.211 --> 04:06.200
I'm an attorney.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.507
Boy, this ain't any canoe.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.708
This is Hitler's canoe.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.307
-$500.
-Look.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.409
I'm just buying it for a camping trip.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.353
It's gonna cost me $40 just to paint over
the swastika on the other side.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.824
What? Paint over the swastika?

04:20.927 --> 04:24.090
It's a war trophy.
You're painting over my victory.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.358
The deal is off!

04:26.466 --> 04:27.763
Well, too bad.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.797
[exclaiming]

04:32.472 --> 04:34.303
Fine! Sold!

04:34.407 --> 04:36.534
Hank, do something useful
for once in your life...

04:36.643 --> 04:41.103
and help me carry Hitler's canoe
out to this patriot's car.

04:43.182 --> 04:47.278
Boy, this fits my hand
like a comfortable shoe.

04:47.387 --> 04:51.050
Careful. That's an antique falconer's glove.
Belonged to Hermann Goering.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.283
For you, $80.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.353
Do you accept prepaid phone cards?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.566
Aunt Peggy, I don't think this is right.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.727
He's a very old man.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.102
Luanne, this is for charity.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.398
Oh, yeah.

05:13.446 --> 05:16.574
-Yeah, it's the maroon Mitsubishi.
-Mitsubishi?

05:16.716 --> 05:19.207
They made the planes
that bombed Pearl Harbor!

05:19.319 --> 05:23.278
-I ain't selling Hitler's canoe to no traitor.
-We had a verbal agreement.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.523
You're a witness.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.559
You don't deserve no Hitler's canoe.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.159
Dad, calm down.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.892
(Cotton) Don't tell me to calm down,
Boy Scout! I'm a war hero!

05:35.068 --> 05:36.899
I killed 50 men!

05:37.003 --> 05:39.164
Now, hop in your sushi boat and git!

05:39.405 --> 05:40.895
Whoa, whoa!

05:41.007 --> 05:41.996
All right! All right!

05:42.108 --> 05:46.101
Listen up. If you're driving a Nazi car
or an ltalian scooter...

05:46.245 --> 05:48.475
get your Axis-loving ass out of here!

05:50.116 --> 05:51.344
[quavering]

05:51.451 --> 05:53.976
-Let's go.
-But I paid for another throw.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.813
[grunting]

06:01.027 --> 06:03.461
-Where'd you get that bird?
-lnternet.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.860
What's the hood for?

06:04.964 --> 06:08.161
I think you take it off
when you want him to do a trick.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.827
-Make him do a trick.
-Okay.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.305
-Falcon, do a loop-the-loop.
-Yeah!

06:14.407 --> 06:16.602
-A barrel roll! Scratch that.
-Yeah.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.739
A reverse barrel roll...

06:20.847 --> 06:22.246
then back to the glove.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.475
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

[falcon screeching]

06:27.520 --> 06:28.782
[screaming]

06:29.389 --> 06:30.356
Ta-da!

06:33.860 --> 06:35.418
(Cotton) Seized by the sheriff.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.065
We've been captured on our own soil.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.531
Incoming.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.630
I've got two platoons of propane
right here...

06:48.741 --> 06:50.834
and reinforcements are on the way.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.604
Hank, go away.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.205
It's all over.

06:54.313 --> 06:57.248
No, no.
I worked out an easy payment plan.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.614
I've got pre-stamped envelopes.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.880
You don't have to sell
any more of your stuff.

07:01.988 --> 07:05.446
We ain't selling it. It's being repoed.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.051
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.652
Here's everything
we got from the rummage sale.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.321
$41.

07:12.899 --> 07:16.164
Now, git. It's 4:00, time for Judge Judy,

07:21.741 --> 07:23.732
(Hank) Shouldn't that TV be plugged in?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.872
Dad, you guys deserve better than this.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.643
You're damn straight, we do!
Bring us a heat lamp.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.446
And some sandwiches.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.078
I'm so goddang hungry.

[humming]

07:51.637 --> 07:53.264
Hey, Peggy, guess what?

07:57.910 --> 08:02.074
Welcome to the new VFW Headquarters,
Hank's wife.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.170
[gasps]

08:03.282 --> 08:05.147
Sorry, we broke your crapper.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.653
[yawning] It is 2:00 a.m.

08:13.759 --> 08:17.024
Now, I am as patriotic as the next person.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.393
But if I am not
at the top of my teaching game...

08:19.499 --> 08:21.091
it is the children who suffer.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.192
They promised they'd go home
as soon as the movie was over.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.965
I can't go in there
and just turn off the Duke.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.132
[guifire oi TV]

08:33.179 --> 08:34.645
[men snoring]

09:06.546 --> 09:09.140
They looked like
little angels sleeping there.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.245
The smell was unimaginable.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.851
Well, I'll shuttle them home
in the morning.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.582
I bet I could do it in four trips.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.490
What they need is some new blood
to join their organization.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.926
Maybe they could merge with the Kiwanis.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.189
Now, wait a minute. What about Vietnam?

09:26.299 --> 09:29.462
Those guys always have
some kind of float in the parade...

09:29.602 --> 09:32.162
and I heard the landlord
is having a heck of a time...

09:32.271 --> 09:34.296
renting out the VFW building.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.672
Maybe if the old vets
could get the Vietnam guys to join up...

09:37.777 --> 09:39.244
they could get their post back.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.210
Well, I know a Vietnam vet.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.976
Dr. Sarti, my gynecologist.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.244
They needed those guys over there?

09:47.653 --> 09:50.451
Hank, I keep in touch
with some of the guys from my unit...

09:50.556 --> 09:54.219
but none of us really have time
to sit around rehashing war stories.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.596
I've got a family
and a very successful practice.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.064
-I understand.
-I treat a lot of prominent women.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.227
-Okay, then--
-Deputy Mayors and such.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.134
Yeah. Thank you very much for your time.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.638
Hey, you know, a patient of mine,
Karen Schwinn...

10:08.741 --> 10:11.767
chronic yeast infection.
Her husband runs a support group for vets.

10:11.877 --> 10:14.744
He used to like to talk about the Nam.
I'll call you with his number.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.475
-Thank you, Dr. Sarti.
-Wish I could be of more help.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.845
[sighs]

10:19.051 --> 10:21.246
Goodbye, Doctor. Sir.

10:25.191 --> 10:30.094
Well, I've been doing a little research
and I found out you need to train falcons.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.764
Oh, that's probably why it attacked me.

10:33.099 --> 10:37.092
He has completed my training course,
as have I his.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.728
Turns out falcons are hunting birds.

10:39.839 --> 10:43.900
They catch mice, rats, moles, voles...

10:44.010 --> 10:45.307
and chipmunks.

10:45.811 --> 10:46.903
What's a vole?

10:47.013 --> 10:49.038
Don't know. Let's find out.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.242
Falcon, bring us back a vole.

10:52.885 --> 10:53.852
No.

[falcon screeching]

10:59.058 --> 11:00.992
So, Bill's a vole.

11:05.131 --> 11:08.191
I ran into a guy from my unit,
Skullcrusher.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.329
He manages a shoe store.

11:10.770 --> 11:11.759
[sighing]

11:11.871 --> 11:15.534
-How come I can't get it together?
-It's not a race, man.

11:16.242 --> 11:20.406
But as long as you keep taking your meds,
you are moving forward.

11:20.579 --> 11:21.705
[electronic beeping]

11:21.814 --> 11:25.580
It's cool, it's cool. We're just out of time.
See you next week.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.012
[men chattering]

11:31.724 --> 11:34.522
Hi, I'm Hank Hill.
I talked to you on the phone.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.858
Right. Dr. Sarti's friend.
What's on your mind?

11:37.963 --> 11:41.922
Well, I wanted to talk to y'all
about joining the VFW.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.126
[men exclaiming]

11:43.235 --> 11:44.964
We tried that already.

11:45.071 --> 11:49.405
When me and TJ got home from the war,
we went over to the Arlen VFW.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.806
This short guy head-butted TJ
right in the nads.

11:55.147 --> 11:59.948
Yeah, that was probably my dad
and he feels bad about that.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.241
Yeah?

12:01.687 --> 12:02.654
Yeah, sure.

12:02.755 --> 12:06.748
You know, the World War ll vets
are looking to reach out to you guys...

12:06.859 --> 12:10.590
but they feel guilty
and, you know, that other stuff....

12:10.696 --> 12:13.164
Well, you should get together
and talk about it.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.894
Look, they want you to come
to a barbeque. Just hear them out.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.394
We'll meet them. But no promises.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.268
One more thing.

12:22.374 --> 12:23.898
Do I need to bring a bathing suit?

12:25.845 --> 12:29.747
Vietnam boys? No gat dang way!

12:29.849 --> 12:34.752
The VFW stands for Veterans of Foreign
Wars not Reefer-Smoking Losers!

12:34.854 --> 12:38.290
But they fought and died for their country
just like you guys did.

12:38.390 --> 12:42.417
Zip it, boy! I'm trying to watch
my nudie channel. Now, get along.

12:45.197 --> 12:48.223
What?
Well, now, where's my nudie channel?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.068
Hold it.

12:50.469 --> 12:53.370
I think this one's ready to take her top off.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.166
That's Diane Sawyer, Dad.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.000
She's not gonna take her top off, is she?

12:59.712 --> 13:02.476
You know, if the Vietnam vets
started paying dues...

13:02.581 --> 13:05.812
I bet you could afford a whole bunch
of nudie channels.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.249
[groaning]

13:10.856 --> 13:14.121
If any of these sissies
whines about Agent Orange...

13:14.226 --> 13:15.750
I'll split him butt to brow.

13:15.861 --> 13:20.230
Look at those guys!
All over each other. Sickening.

13:20.332 --> 13:23.324
Now, that's probably
just part of the therapy.

13:23.435 --> 13:27.428
That's, well.... Okay, that is a little creepy.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.433
Hey, you found us.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.670
No sweat. I did recon in Nam.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.746
And we saw the balloons
from the highway.

13:34.847 --> 13:38.078
Well, greetings, fellow veterans.
I'm the CO here.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.948
Colonel Cotton Hill, 77th Division,
US Army.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.750
As I was just telling my boy here,
we think you are all...

13:46.192 --> 13:50.720
worthy to join the VFW
and start paying dues immediately.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.797
Whoa.

13:51.964 --> 13:55.627
Slow down, Colonel.
We're not sure we want to join.

13:55.734 --> 13:59.295
The Arlen VFW has ignored us
for 25 years.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.238
Heck, the Vietcong invited us back
before you did...

14:02.341 --> 14:04.775
and they gave us free mopeds
for the week.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.208
Look, I'm sorry.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.977
I guess we weren't used to losing a war.

14:10.082 --> 14:13.779
Well, excuse us for not just dropping
a couple of atomic bombs.

14:13.886 --> 14:17.344
Hey, fellas.
I know something we can all agree on.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.448
Beer. What say we invade the cooler?

14:21.227 --> 14:22.785
(all) Yeah.

14:27.566 --> 14:31.229
(Ronnie) This one time my buddy, Lenny,
was showing me a picture of his wife.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.729
Wind comes up out of nowhere
and blows the picture away.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.537
Lenny goes chasing after it.
Sniper got him in the right temple.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.807
My best friend got killed
just because he missed his wife.

14:42.214 --> 14:47.015
I spent four years away from my wife
in dogfights...

14:47.119 --> 14:49.349
with Zeroes over the Pacific.

14:50.089 --> 14:55.049
Those four years in my F6 Hellcat
were the only peace and quiet I ever got!

14:55.527 --> 14:56.721
[all guffawing]

14:59.098 --> 15:02.067
-Anyone got a bottle opener?
-Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.702
(Cotton) Hey, a bayonet.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.805
Toss that over here.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.367
Boy, this takes me back.

15:10.476 --> 15:14.037
Topsy, remember that kamikaze
you gutted back on lwo?

15:14.179 --> 15:15.510
What did he say?

15:15.881 --> 15:17.405
[both exclaiming]

15:17.516 --> 15:18.813
[both grunting]

15:20.319 --> 15:21.980
Stop it! Stop it!

15:22.721 --> 15:24.689
You're freaking Ronnie out, man.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.323
Maybe, you should ease up a little, Dad.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.360
[exclaiming]

15:29.895 --> 15:33.695
Colonel, these guys are trauma cases.
They've got delicate psyches.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.528
Stop it! Stop it!

15:35.634 --> 15:38.603
Oh, come on, boy! This bothers you?

15:39.038 --> 15:40.300
How about this?

15:40.406 --> 15:41.373
[grunting]

15:41.473 --> 15:42.440
[gibbering]

15:45.344 --> 15:47.141
Cut it out!

15:47.279 --> 15:48.712
[screaming]

15:51.817 --> 15:53.808
Easy there, big boy.

15:54.586 --> 15:55.814
[groaning]

15:57.957 --> 16:00.084
Come and get me, you cowards.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.990
[grunting]

16:10.703 --> 16:11.965
[panting]

16:12.237 --> 16:13.204
(Hank) Oh, no.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.006
Let's get that midget son of a bitch.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.441
[all yelling]

16:21.113 --> 16:24.879
Come on, people,
remember your breathing exercises.

16:31.523 --> 16:34.959
That big loony swung on me.
I was just defending myself.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.496
But why did you push him?
I found those guys at a trauma ward.

16:38.697 --> 16:42.189
Well, maybe we can go back
when they've cooled down.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.735
I'll get them drunk
and we'll put things right.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.806
Dad, listen to me.
They're gonna cut our heads off.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.807
[men whooping]

16:50.843 --> 16:53.311
They're getting close.
Quick, Dad, hop up on my back.

16:53.412 --> 16:54.845
I ain't no papoose.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.247
Well....

16:57.149 --> 16:59.947
Look, on account
of your combat experience...

17:00.052 --> 17:03.180
maybe you could see what's going on
better from up there.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.989
Not a terrible idea.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.522
This will be my command post.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.953
Over there!

17:11.363 --> 17:12.329
(Cotton) Move it!

17:12.964 --> 17:14.728
This is real bad, man.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.634
You guys might have undone
30 years of therapy.

17:18.737 --> 17:19.829
Dirty hippie.

17:21.073 --> 17:24.201
You know, you could benefit
from a little group therapy.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.106
Clear up some of that anger.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.875
I haven't slept in 50 years.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.814
I'm so tired.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.608
Come on, faster, mule! Faster!

17:34.253 --> 17:35.720
[panting]

17:37.556 --> 17:38.853
[Cotton grunting]

17:39.658 --> 17:42.786
Hell, it'd be faster
if I'd carried you on my shoulders.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.132
Despite my expert navigation,
you still managed to get us lost.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.295
Nice job.

17:53.405 --> 17:57.603
Hold on, Dad. I know the highway
runs along the southern edge of the forest.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.507
If we keep heading south,
we can eventually find help.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.580
Well, how we gonna find south?

18:02.681 --> 18:05.149
You pack a compass
in your Boy Scout purse?

18:06.919 --> 18:10.411
Moss. Moss always grows
on the north side of a tree.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.152
All right, Dad, saddle up.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.589
[men yelling]

18:22.000 --> 18:24.195
Goddang, we're trapped like rats.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.965
No, we're not. There's a beaver hole.
See the tracks?

18:27.072 --> 18:29.939
Where there's a beaver hole,
there's got to be a beaver dam.

18:30.042 --> 18:33.307
Now, let's follow the current.
The dam's got to be downstream.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.138
There it is.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.622
[men yelling]

18:51.196 --> 18:54.825
(Cotton) No, this ain't a flashback.
You're losing again!

18:54.933 --> 18:55.900
[cheering]

18:56.635 --> 19:00.264
If you're wondering where the falcon is,
I let him go in the woods.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.970
Kept the glove, though.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.508
Keeps my beer from cooling my hand...

19:04.610 --> 19:07.636
and keeps my hand
from warming my beer.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.582
It looks pretty bad-ass.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.673
-Do you think I could wear--
-No.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.553
Well, not to beat a dead horse, fellows...

19:15.654 --> 19:18.020
but what is your favorite kind of sausage?

19:18.123 --> 19:20.785
Chicken and apple, breakfast patty...

19:20.893 --> 19:23.418
Italian, spicy ltalian, sweet ltalian--

19:24.096 --> 19:25.461
[screaming]

19:26.331 --> 19:27.696
[falcon screeching]

19:29.902 --> 19:31.870
He found his way home.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.933
(Hank) We should head downhill.

19:34.039 --> 19:37.566
There's more tree cover
and we should be able to hit the highway.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.610
You draft-dodging ninny!

19:39.711 --> 19:42.578
The first rule of combat
is to take the high ground.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.549
Now uphill, boy. March! Schiell! Schiell!

19:49.054 --> 19:50.351
[Hank panting]

19:50.923 --> 19:53.357
Oh, hell. I pooped the bed.

19:53.892 --> 19:55.723
[men chattering]

19:55.894 --> 19:56.952
Dad, you wait here.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.395
I'll try to find some footholds
that will support both of us.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.162
[gasping]

20:04.036 --> 20:06.197
There's got to be a way out of here.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.083
Boy...

20:19.651 --> 20:20.982
we're surrounded.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.814
All right, get behind me.
I'll try to fight them off.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.184
I've got a pretty thick neck.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.123
Maybe while they're sawing through it,
you can slip down the hill.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.856
I ain't leaving.
They're gonna have to gut me, too.

20:32.431 --> 20:36.527
I'm sorry, Dad. It was a bad idea
to try to get everyone together.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.624
-I guess, I just--
-No!

20:37.736 --> 20:41.035
Dang it, Hank, don't apologize!
You did everything right.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.300
I screwed up.

20:44.142 --> 20:47.077
Sometimes you can do everything right
and still lose.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.245
It ain't your fault.
You gave it everything you had.

20:50.349 --> 20:54.376
That's all I ever asked of my men.
Thanks for trying, soldier.

20:56.655 --> 20:57.952
[men sobbing]

20:58.056 --> 21:00.149
That's all we ever wanted to hear.

21:00.559 --> 21:01.924
You did your best.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.759
Thanks for trying.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.661
Well, I gotta say I'm surprised
you fellas are as good as you is.

21:10.369 --> 21:14.533
Shoot, you captured Cotton Hill.
The whole Nazi army couldn't do that.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.906
As commanding officer
of the local VFW post...

21:19.011 --> 21:23.004
I would be honored
to have you fellas join our organization...

21:23.115 --> 21:27.347
on the one condition,
that you stop all this goddang bawling.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.818
We'll do our best, Colonel.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.519
Oh, what are you smiling about?

21:37.629 --> 21:40.223
You think you're getting
your propane bill paid.

21:40.332 --> 21:41.663
Well, you ain't.

21:41.767 --> 21:45.328
You're in a long line, behind cable,
hooch, and scooch.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.541
-You ever get shot?
-I got a plate in my head.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.633
No kidding? I got no shins.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.617
