Andi:
 Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.420 --> 00:07.460
Jonah. He just walked in.

00:07.460 --> 00:08.580
You got my text, right?

00:08.580 --> 00:11.080
You mean the one
where you said I'm girly?

00:11.080 --> 00:13.040
That's some stupid auto-correct.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.290
It was supposed
to be you're gnarly.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.210
I'm gnarly.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.540
I seem to remember that
when you first got here,

00:21.540 --> 00:23.380
you said you'd only
be staying for a short time.

00:23.380 --> 00:26.000
Stop!
What are you saying?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.420
She's saying she wants me
to move out.

00:28.420 --> 00:29.960
(heavy metal playing)

00:31.000 --> 00:32.330
What?

00:32.330 --> 00:33.750
She's turning into you.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.380
And I can't watch.

00:35.380 --> 00:38.790
Let's get out of here.
But I... don't wanna go home.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.080
Me neither.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.920
This is where we live now.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.500
What are you looking for?

01:02.500 --> 01:05.250
My jeans with the patches.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.170
Mm-hmm.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.210
(sigh)

01:13.120 --> 01:14.620
Now are what you looking for?

01:14.620 --> 01:17.540
My other jeans
with the patches.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.920
Those are the wrong ones.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.120
Can they
be the right ones today?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.000
Oh, here they are.

01:26.250 --> 01:30.250
-No! Ow, ow! -Sorry! I
didn't wanna wake you.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.380
I didn't want
you to, either.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.170
This feels greasy.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.380
And it... smells like kiwi.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.210
You didn't take the lip balm
out of the pocket.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.500
Why would I do that?

01:57.500 --> 01:58.750
Because it messes up
the laundry.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.120
CeCe goes through every pocket before
she puts something in the wash.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.920
Well, CeCe isn't doing
Andi's laundry anymore,

02:04.920 --> 02:06.830
so checking for lip balm
in Andi's pockets

02:06.830 --> 02:09.669
is something
Andi has to do now. Got it?

02:09.669 --> 02:11.330
Got it.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.750
(sigh)

02:18.750 --> 02:20.250
I'm sorry!

02:20.250 --> 02:22.040
I didn't mean
to be snippy.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.670
Just haven't
had my coffee yet.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.750
I'm not really human
until I have my coffee.

(coffee machine stops)

02:30.290 --> 02:31.920
Sorry!

02:34.080 --> 02:36.880
Don't worry about it,
I'm fine.

I think it might be over

03:33.960 --> 03:35.330
between me and Iris.

03:36.670 --> 03:39.290
The girl who saw you
puke in your shoe?

03:39.290 --> 03:42.380
Huh, I thought
that'd last forever.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.420
She hasn't been answering

03:43.420 --> 03:44.460
my texts asking if it's over

03:44.460 --> 03:45.330
between us.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.120
So, I guess that means

03:48.120 --> 03:49.210
it's over between us.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.080
It's better to have loved
and lost

03:52.080 --> 03:54.500
than to have never loved at all.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.170
Or whatever I was feeling
towards her.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.620
You'll meet someone else.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.920
Of course I will!

03:59.920 --> 04:01.620
Look at this hair!

04:01.620 --> 04:03.290
But, for the moment,

04:03.290 --> 04:04.420
this creates a problem.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.540
To eradicate the memory

04:06.540 --> 04:08.460
of the puke shoe incident,

04:08.460 --> 04:11.250
I purchased four tickets
to sports.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.380
Could you be more specific?

04:14.380 --> 04:16.079
Wish I could.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.420
Something with a ball,

04:17.420 --> 04:20.620
which seemed like a fun,
pitfall-free outing

04:20.620 --> 04:22.380
for me and Jonah
and our ladies.

04:22.380 --> 04:25.080
And now you don't
have a lady.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.500
Or do I?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.420
What's that smile?

04:29.420 --> 04:32.620
This is my "would you like
to be my plus-one" smile?

04:32.620 --> 04:36.790
And this is
my "not a chance" smile.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.460
Oh, come on, please?
I'll owe you big time.

04:39.460 --> 04:42.380
You know how much you like it
when people owe you.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.290
True... I do like that.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.170
Sorry to keep you waiting.
(laughs)

04:49.170 --> 04:51.080
Hey, when do we get to see
the new apartment?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.210
Soon.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.420
What's going on
with your pants?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.290
I don't know.

04:57.290 --> 04:59.250
Bex did the laundry.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.500
Are you okay?

05:01.500 --> 05:05.290
Yeah! Really okay.
It's like this adventure...

05:05.290 --> 05:07.500
that I didn't know
I was going on.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.620
You probably miss
living at home.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.380
Maybe a little.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.620
If we use two appliances
at once, then the lights go out.

05:15.620 --> 05:18.290
And the Wi-Fi is
"Coffee Shop Guest."

05:20.290 --> 05:22.290
Can't you guys just move back?

05:22.290 --> 05:27.080
I don't think that's an option. We
haven't spoken to CeCe since we left.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.880
But, it's not like
we're still fighting.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.380
Now it's more a game of chicken
over who makes the first call.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.170
I know that game. My parents
play it all the time.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.330
Sometimes they play it
for so long

05:37.330 --> 05:40.460
that they don't remember why
they're not talking to each other.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.330
I'm sorry
you're going through this.

05:42.330 --> 05:45.040
It's weird to wake up
and not know where you are.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.080
But, everything
is gonna be fine.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.710
We just have
to make some adjustments.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.380
So we see.

05:53.380 --> 05:54.460
(all laughing)

05:54.460 --> 05:56.670
It's like she used
fabric hardener.

06:00.670 --> 06:03.120
Uugh!

06:03.120 --> 06:05.670
Everything okay over there?

06:05.670 --> 06:10.080
You're five feet away. There is no
"over there" in this apartment!

06:13.170 --> 06:14.710
So... no?

06:17.420 --> 06:19.500
What's the problem?

06:19.500 --> 06:23.460
I'm being tortured
by quadratic equations.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.210
Stupid numbers,
why do you hate me so!

06:26.210 --> 06:29.670
Okay... step away
from the math.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.000
You need to de-stress.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.380
-I can't.
-Why not?

06:33.380 --> 06:37.880
Because... I don't have my duct tape.
I don't have my zigzag scissors!

06:37.880 --> 06:39.500
My glue gun!

06:39.500 --> 06:45.330
If I was home where--
I mean, where we used to live,

06:45.330 --> 06:46.620
You had AndiShack.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.380
Yeah.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.920
Okay, so...
you need supplies.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.920
The stores are closed.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.670
Well, maybe there's
another solution.

06:56.670 --> 07:00.250
There isn't.
There are no solutions!

07:01.960 --> 07:03.420
(sighs)

07:10.790 --> 07:11.880
How's it goin'?

07:13.120 --> 07:16.170
I-- I was wonderin'
if you wanted to watch our show?

07:16.170 --> 07:17.500
What show?

07:17.500 --> 07:20.920
Any... show.
Or-- or go get frozen yogurt.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.460
Or do anything else that would
stop you from exercising

07:24.460 --> 07:25.880
for five minutes.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.460
This is relaxing.

07:28.830 --> 07:30.670
Can we at least talk?

07:33.830 --> 07:36.170
This has gone on long enough.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.540
I think you should call them.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.290
I think they should call me.

07:41.290 --> 07:44.290
Celia... how many times have you
driven past their building?

07:44.290 --> 07:47.920
I just want to make sure
they have a decent supermarket

07:47.920 --> 07:50.040
and a 24-hour pharmacy.

07:51.460 --> 07:54.000
I miss them, too.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.580
We were just startin' to feel like your
average every day dysfunctional family.

07:59.330 --> 08:03.920
Ham... they don't wanna
live with me.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.460
Oh, I-- I don't think
that's true.

08:07.460 --> 08:11.040
I believe they would come back
if you just... asked them to.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.380
They won't come back.

08:15.380 --> 08:16.960
They're never coming back.

08:18.380 --> 08:22.170
I-- I really need to exercise right now.
Thank you.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.540
-Did you hear that?
-Sh-shh.

08:28.540 --> 08:31.330
(sounds from outside)

08:38.580 --> 08:40.250
Hey-hey.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.710
We didn't mean to scare you.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.250
We just needed art supplies.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.880
What about food?
D-- D-- Do you need some food?

08:52.880 --> 08:53.920
-We have food.
-Yes!

08:53.920 --> 08:56.170
I made some lasagna,
I can wrap some up.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.540
Can I have some now?

08:57.540 --> 08:58.540
Ha.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.120
I... don't need a plate.

09:09.380 --> 09:14.170
C-- Can I just say how very...
happy we are to... see you?

09:14.170 --> 09:15.580
Thanks, Dad.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.120
(with mouth full)
This is delicious.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.420
W-- We were just sayin'
how much we miss you.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.500
Weren't we?

09:25.500 --> 09:27.460
Dad, it's pointless.
She'll never admit--

09:27.460 --> 09:29.620
I do.

09:29.620 --> 09:32.830
Oh. Um...

09:32.830 --> 09:34.380
Wow.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.330
Are you still mad at me?

09:38.330 --> 09:40.380
Do you still think
I'm a monster?

09:40.380 --> 09:41.420
No!

09:43.250 --> 09:44.290
I need a hug.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.420
I need one, too.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.710
Is there anything else you
need from here, before we go?

10:00.710 --> 10:04.790
What? I thought this meant
you were coming back home.

10:04.790 --> 10:07.250
No, Dad. We have
our own home now.

10:08.290 --> 10:09.670
I told you.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.790
We should be going.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.500
Just to be clear...
this is your choice.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.250
I did not ask you to leave.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.290
Do you need me
to sign something?

10:20.290 --> 10:22.920
-Let the record show--
-Yes, let the record show...

10:22.920 --> 10:26.120
I don't wanna be fighting
about this 13 years from now.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.460
Well, that was really nice
there. For a second.

10:36.540 --> 10:38.920
(elliptical machine whirring)

10:44.250 --> 10:47.460
Listen, don't think
I'm not super, super grateful--

10:47.460 --> 10:51.460
No buts! You are
super, super grateful.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.790
No buts. However...
your Jonah Beck impression?

10:55.790 --> 10:58.420
Which is hilarious...
please don't.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.620
No problem.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.380
Thank you. You can be very
understanding when you want to be.

11:05.380 --> 11:09.290
I just won't say,
"That was docious magocious!"

11:09.290 --> 11:12.500
-Which is almost never. -Dude,
you're speaking my language!

11:12.500 --> 11:14.540
Where is Amber?

11:14.540 --> 11:17.790
With Iris, who was totally bummed out to
hear you already had a new girlfriend.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.500
-I don't--
-He doesn't.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.170
I thought Iris
was dumping me.

11:21.170 --> 11:24.580
Nah, just givin' you a few days
of the silent treatment.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.670
It's like some kinda test.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.120
Amber invented it.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.250
She's the next Steve Jobs.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.920
And I failed it!

11:31.920 --> 11:34.460
I-- I don't wanna hurt Iris
more than I already have.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.420
Meaning what?

11:36.420 --> 11:38.920
It was callous of me
to invite you,

11:38.920 --> 11:41.790
and it... cost Jonah
time with Amber...

11:41.790 --> 11:43.750
Are you blowing me off?

11:43.750 --> 11:46.330
Y-- You don't have to.

11:46.330 --> 11:50.500
It should just be the two of us.
It's what Amber would've wanted.

11:52.290 --> 11:54.290
Yeah, you... have a point.

11:55.880 --> 11:56.960
Sorry, Buffy.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.250
Duuude, don't be.
It's all docious magocious!

12:01.250 --> 12:03.580
Thank you for understanding.

12:03.580 --> 12:05.620
You still owe me big time.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.380
But now it's big, big time.

12:11.330 --> 12:16.620
Well, it's just you and me, brah.
Go, sports!

12:25.830 --> 12:27.290
Bex!

12:27.290 --> 12:28.960
Mom!

12:28.960 --> 12:30.710
Why are we shouting?

12:30.710 --> 12:32.330
Why are you here?

12:32.330 --> 12:34.290
I wanted to talk,
just you and me.

12:34.290 --> 12:37.420
Oh-- Uh, w-- Um...
now's not a good time.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.290
I'm... on my way out.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.170
Oh, where are you going?
I'll go with you.

12:41.170 --> 12:43.080
Can't it wait?

12:43.080 --> 12:46.170
Sure, Mom. It can wait.
I was under the impression

12:46.170 --> 12:47.790
you wanted a relationship
with me and Andi,

12:47.790 --> 12:50.500
but, yeah, we can let this
fester as long as you like.

12:52.710 --> 12:55.170
Why do you always have
to make me the bad guy?

12:56.170 --> 12:57.290
You're not.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.460
In fact, I...
came here to apologize.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.790
Oh.

13:05.790 --> 13:08.170
Well... please continue.

13:09.460 --> 13:12.290
We both knew it was time
for me to get my own place.

13:13.290 --> 13:16.880
But, I should've told you
I was taking Andi with me.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.120
Yes, you should have.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.000
It was very painful.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.880
She misses you.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.830
And I miss her.

13:31.830 --> 13:35.920
Maybe... someday you'll
feel that way about me.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.420
There's no chance you'd ever
feel that way about me.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.750
You're always the optimist.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.210
Well, uh, that's
all I came to say.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.330
So, if you're ready to go...

13:51.330 --> 13:53.330
Go? G-- Where?

13:53.330 --> 13:55.750
You just said,
"I'm on my way out"?

13:55.750 --> 13:59.620
Oh! I did. (laughs) That's-- Um...
I... just remembered

13:59.620 --> 14:01.210
there's something
I need to do here.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.210
Okay.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.250
That was close.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.670
-Hi.
-Hey-hey!

14:31.670 --> 14:33.500
Where ya been?

14:33.500 --> 14:36.170
I've been getting math tutoring
from Buffy.

14:36.170 --> 14:37.880
She's really good at math.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.170
Really good!

14:39.170 --> 14:41.620
So.. that's all homework?

14:41.620 --> 14:43.000
What do you mean?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.500
Your backpack looks stuffed.

14:45.500 --> 14:49.330
Yeah. These schoolbooks just
keep getting bigger and bigger.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.420
Okay.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.920
Knock off
the innocent act.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.580
I know where you've been.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.170
I've been at Buffy's!

14:57.170 --> 14:58.500
You can call her!

14:58.500 --> 14:59.960
In... a minute.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.750
Please.
You reek of fabric softener.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.880
No. I don't!

15:04.880 --> 15:05.920
Wh--?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.670
How did that get there?

15:10.670 --> 15:15.710
Oh, I don't know...
maybe from... this?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.040
I'm sorry.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.830
I never wanted you
to know.

15:21.830 --> 15:25.040
You let her
do your laundry?

15:25.040 --> 15:26.420
Behind my back?

15:26.420 --> 15:27.580
Right after
we moved in together?

15:27.580 --> 15:30.580
I-- I... was thinking
about you the whole time!

15:37.670 --> 15:39.080
Are you mad?

15:40.170 --> 15:42.330
I'm not mad.

15:42.330 --> 15:44.420
You don't have to lie
to me about going over there.

15:44.420 --> 15:46.500
I didn't wanna hurt you.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.420
I'm fine with it.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.420
The only way you could hurt me
is by lying to me.

15:51.420 --> 15:55.500
I'll never do it again.
I promise.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.420
Good. And the next
time you go over there

15:57.420 --> 15:59.880
with your dirty clothes...
take mine.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.250
(laughs)

16:02.830 --> 16:04.120
Deal.

16:13.620 --> 16:16.710
This is me and Jonah
eating our third hot dogs...

16:16.710 --> 16:19.920
This is me and Jonah wearing the
mini-helmets we ate ice cream out of.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.540
Oh! This is me getting mustard and
ice cream off of Jonah's shirt

16:22.540 --> 16:23.750
with seltzer water!

16:23.750 --> 16:26.960
Looks like fun!
Wish I'd been there.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.170
Longer.

16:28.170 --> 16:31.250
I really wish I could
make it up to you somehow.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.670
I know! I'll show you
the pictures again!

16:32.670 --> 16:37.210
-This is me and Jonah-- -If you
really wanna make it up to me...

16:37.210 --> 16:38.330
I like that jacket.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.380
You want my team jacket?

16:40.380 --> 16:42.420
But, I'm such
a big fan of...

16:44.170 --> 16:45.920
Is there a name
on here somewhere?

16:45.920 --> 16:47.920
Oh, here it is.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.540
It says,
"Property of Buffy Driscoll."

16:51.540 --> 16:53.460
But, Jonah bought
the same jacket,

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
right before I bought
my jacket.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.420
And we're both
wearing it today.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.290
And he's my first ever
guy friend--

16:59.290 --> 17:01.420
Fine. Keep it.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.290
Thank you.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.119
Speaking of your guy friend,

17:06.119 --> 17:09.380
looks like someone
didn't get the twinsies memo.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.619
'Sup?

17:19.619 --> 17:20.829
'Sup?

17:20.829 --> 17:22.460
Where's your jacket?

17:22.460 --> 17:23.790
I left it at home.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.119
I didn't want us to look like
a couple of dorks, right?

17:26.119 --> 17:29.290
Pshh-- Yeah, of course.

17:29.290 --> 17:32.670
So, uh...
maybe we can hang later?

17:32.670 --> 17:34.830
I'm meeting Amber
at the spoon.

17:36.460 --> 17:39.830
No problemo,
'nother time, brah!

17:43.250 --> 17:45.170
Are you okay?

17:45.170 --> 17:47.500
Yeah, I'm good.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
I really do owe you big time.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.380
Yes!

17:53.620 --> 17:56.460
This jacket's docious magocious?

17:56.460 --> 17:58.750
Too soon.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.960
Andi! Dinner!

18:12.290 --> 18:14.670
Why isn't the oven on?

18:14.670 --> 18:17.330
Did we blow another fuse?

18:19.420 --> 18:22.040
This thing doesn't even work!

18:22.040 --> 18:24.670
You could just microwave it.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.420
It won't taste as good, but...

18:26.420 --> 18:28.040
I guess that's
our only option.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.830
Uuuuuugh!

18:45.830 --> 18:47.580
I don't mind cold lasagna.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.330
It's frozen!

18:50.420 --> 18:56.500
We could... just... let
it sit out and defrost.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.420
No, you're not eating dinner
at midnight.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.380
It's gonna be okay.

19:04.380 --> 19:07.420
You're right.
It is going to be okay.

19:13.330 --> 19:14.830
Go pack your things.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.500
Why?

19:16.500 --> 19:18.460
I did this too fast.

19:18.460 --> 19:21.380
I made an impulsive decision.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.170
You had a nice life.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.540
You had a nice room.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.460
You had AndiShack.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.330
I took you away from that.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.790
I'm taking you back.

19:30.790 --> 19:34.460
-But-- -No buts.
I'm your mother.

19:34.460 --> 19:37.210
As your mother,
I do what's best for you.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.250
This is what's best for you.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.540
I'll go.

19:42.670 --> 19:45.290
But only if you come with me.

19:45.290 --> 19:46.540
I can't.

19:49.460 --> 19:52.500
I have to stand
on my own two feet now.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.960
I need to figure out
how to make a home,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.170
so we can be together someday.

19:56.170 --> 19:58.830
But you'll be alone.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.290
I can do that.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.830
As long as I don't
turn on any appliances.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.380
(doorbell rings)

20:10.420 --> 20:12.080
She hasn't eaten.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.380
Have you?

20:19.330 --> 20:20.500
I'm fine.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.540
I promise. I am fine.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.210
Food. Go.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.460
I really wanted
to be able to do this.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.500
It's harder than it looks.

20:53.380 --> 20:54.290
I gotta go.

20:59.790 --> 21:01.790
(knock on door)

21:01.790 --> 21:03.170
How you doin', kiddo?

21:03.170 --> 21:04.460
Good.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.830
Any interest in joining us
downstairs for a movie night?

21:09.380 --> 21:12.120
-Sure. -Great. I--
I'll get the popcorn,

21:12.120 --> 21:14.750
you get your jimmy-jammies on,
and I'll meet you downstairs.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.460
Pow! (laughs)

21:16.460 --> 21:18.170
(laughs)

21:21.080 --> 21:22.790
All right, everybody
got what they need?

21:22.790 --> 21:25.000
Andi, you got Baba?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Okay, well, it looks like
we're ready to go.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.330
Feels like old times, huh?

21:28.330 --> 21:30.330
-(Celia giggles)
-Yeah.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.540
(knocking on door)

21:44.710 --> 21:46.210
Who's there?

21:51.790 --> 21:53.750
Ahhh!

21:53.750 --> 21:55.620
(both laugh)

21:55.620 --> 21:57.580
(laughing)

21:57.580 --> 22:00.500
Baba! You scared me!

22:00.500 --> 22:01.670
What are you doing here?

22:01.670 --> 22:04.250
You two should be in bed.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.380
But first she has
to brush her teeth.

22:07.670 --> 22:09.880
You are making her
brush her teeth?

22:11.790 --> 22:13.500
Of course.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.790
Go brush your teeth!

22:16.580 --> 22:18.750
Thank you, CeCe.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.460
(Andi giggles)

22:28.790 --> 22:32.380
Wow! You're getting
really good with the washi tape.

22:35.580 --> 22:38.420
Uh... do you wanna come in?

22:39.460 --> 22:43.330
Oh... no, I-- I get
the general idea.

22:45.380 --> 22:50.880
It is harder than it looks, but...
apparently, you're getting the hang of it.

22:52.290 --> 22:53.830
I am?

22:53.830 --> 22:57.210
Don't get cocky.
You still have a ways to go.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.750
Thanks, Mom.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.290
Being there felt like old times.

23:20.290 --> 23:22.710
But, it's new times now.

23:22.710 --> 23:25.710
This is my home,
and you're my mom.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.500
I'm your what?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.670
My mom?

23:32.710 --> 23:34.710
You called me Mom!

23:35.710 --> 23:36.710
So?

23:37.920 --> 23:40.120
That was the first time!

23:41.710 --> 23:43.330
Whoa.

23:43.330 --> 23:44.750
Say it again!

23:44.750 --> 23:47.460
Please don't make
a giant thing outta this.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.380
Who shouldn't make
a giant thing outta this?

23:50.380 --> 23:52.210
You.

23:52.210 --> 23:53.670

Mom!

 Next, on Andi Mack...

24:11.120 --> 24:12.290
Andi:
 What do we want?

24:12.290 --> 24:13.330
(indistinct)

24:13.330 --> 24:14.420
When do we want them?

24:14.420 --> 24:15.380
Students:
Now!

24:15.380 --> 24:16.420
Do you know what's going on?

24:16.420 --> 24:17.920
We're protesting the dress code.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.500
-Oh?
-Do you wanna join us?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.290
-Nah, I'm good.
-Oh.

24:21.290 --> 24:22.500
We're the leaders
of this movement.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.580
We have to be strong!

24:23.580 --> 24:25.830
But I'm not strong. I'm weak!

24:25.830 --> 24:27.330
I could get suspended.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.960
That goes
on my permanent record!

24:28.960 --> 24:30.290
There is no permanent record.

24:30.290 --> 24:31.330
What?

24:31.330 --> 24:32.540
I'm the new principal,
Dr. Metcalf.

24:32.540 --> 24:34.170
And I... have been
looking through

24:34.170 --> 24:35.380
