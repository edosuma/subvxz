3x05
Shame

00:28.990 --> 00:31.494
Listen, I hope you realize
how much Drew and I appreciate

00:31.561 --> 00:32.863
you watching Wilfred all the time.

00:32.931 --> 00:35.268
So this is just a little thank-you.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.406
Just ignore what Drew wrote.

00:37.474 --> 00:41.147
He said it was a pun, but then he,
like, couldn't really explain it, so...

00:41.214 --> 00:44.916
Aw, Jenna, I-I can't accept this.
It's a thousand dollars.

00:44.984 --> 00:46.684
Ryan, we owe you the money.

00:46.752 --> 00:48.722
You spend almost every
day watching Wilfred.

00:48.789 --> 00:51.392
If we weren't paying you, we'd
be paying another dog sitter.

00:51.460 --> 00:55.997
Dog sitter?
Well, I-I watch Wilfred 'cause we're...

00:56.065 --> 00:58.367
'cause I-I like
spending time with him.

00:58.435 --> 00:59.835
Oh, well, then why
don't you just...

00:59.903 --> 01:01.804
why don't you just
accept it as a gift?

01:01.871 --> 01:04.706
- Is this charity?
- Okay, the truth is,

01:04.774 --> 01:06.542
the other day, we accidentally
got some of your mail,

01:06.610 --> 01:07.743
and there was this
bright orange envelope

01:07.811 --> 01:10.647
that said "Mortgage payment
past due, final notice."

01:10.715 --> 01:12.016
[chuckles]
Wh-What? N-No.

01:12.084 --> 01:14.752
No, I-I just missed
a payment, that's all.

01:14.820 --> 01:18.323
It just slipped my mind.
In fact, when I'd gotten that envelope,

01:18.391 --> 01:19.859
I'd already sent the
check in the mail, so...

01:19.927 --> 01:21.294
My God, Ryan, I am so sorry.

01:21.362 --> 01:24.898
- I... I didn't mean to offend you.
- Not at all. Not at all.

01:24.965 --> 01:27.734
I appreciate the
gesture, but I-I'm good.

01:27.802 --> 01:30.570
Really. Uh, will you
excuse me for a minute?

01:33.841 --> 01:35.175
<i>Wilfred!</i>

01:36.744 --> 01:38.979
What the hell is this?

01:39.047 --> 01:41.979
It's my bachelor pad.
Pretty nauseating digs, right?

01:42.047 --> 01:43.545
This room is supposed
to be for storage.

01:43.612 --> 01:46.612
- H-How long has it been like this?
- A month or so.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.481
I had to create this
sanctuary of stinking detritus.

01:49.549 --> 01:52.282
You don't understand what it's
like at home right now... no crumbs,

01:52.350 --> 01:54.844
not even a grease smudge,
everything smells Cloroxy.

01:54.911 --> 01:57.344
I just wish Jenna would
stop hanging out

01:57.412 --> 01:59.942
with that anal, OCD
clean-freak, Juanita!

02:00.010 --> 02:01.243
You mean the cleaning lady?

02:01.311 --> 02:04.146
"The cleaning lady."
Did you just come up with that?

02:04.214 --> 02:06.182
That is the perfect
nickname for her.

02:06.249 --> 02:08.318
I'm gonna have to spend
all day cleaning this up.

02:08.386 --> 02:10.252
Before you get
hysterical, let me show you

02:10.321 --> 02:13.421
what I've done with the place.
I think you're gonna like it.

02:13.489 --> 02:18.358
Over here, we've got a massive
pile of Drew's used Q-tips.

02:18.426 --> 02:19.592
[groans]

02:20.160 --> 02:22.394
Big, moldy cantaloupe.

02:23.896 --> 02:25.631
Maroon 5.

02:25.699 --> 02:29.101
Over there's a...
rancid turkey carcass.

02:29.169 --> 02:32.738
And that's just
a weird, like, thing.

02:32.806 --> 02:35.374
I have no idea what that is.

02:35.442 --> 02:39.144
You look like you could use a drink.
Shall we move to the bar?

02:40.380 --> 02:42.147
The bar?

02:43.716 --> 02:45.583
<i>Jenna [in distance]
Ryan, are you okay?</i>

02:45.651 --> 02:49.021
Uh, yeah!
Just... looking for something!

02:49.088 --> 02:51.056
Be back in a sec!

02:51.124 --> 02:54.927
- Why not tell her to come up?
- Ugh. No.

02:54.995 --> 02:58.031
I-I'm not giving Jenna another
reason to think my life's pathetic.

02:58.099 --> 03:00.000
It's bad enough she
saw my mortgage notice.

03:00.068 --> 03:02.269
- But you said you paid it.
- I lied.

03:02.337 --> 03:05.273
The truth is, I owe the bank
$12,000 that I don't have.

03:05.341 --> 03:07.376
Okay, I don't understand amounts,

03:07.443 --> 03:11.880
so I gather from your tone
that that's, like, awesome?

03:11.948 --> 03:14.149
I'm basically a dog sitter.

03:14.217 --> 03:16.152
That's what Jenna called me,
by the way.

03:16.219 --> 03:17.853
When I quit my Dad's firm,

03:17.921 --> 03:20.823
I-I didn't expect my life
to turn out like this.

03:20.891 --> 03:24.326
I hang out and smoke weed with
the neighbor's dog all day.

03:24.394 --> 03:27.196
Shame is like having a daughter
with red hair and freckles;

03:27.264 --> 03:29.832
you cannot let it
become part of your life.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.802
Or maybe shame will motivate me
to pay my bills like a normal adult.

03:32.870 --> 03:34.937
Look, I know what
you're hinting at,

03:35.005 --> 03:37.673
and I don't mind
paying a little rent.

03:37.741 --> 03:42.478
I'll give you, uh... that thing.
What is that?

03:42.546 --> 03:44.613
Wait. That's a great idea.

03:44.681 --> 03:47.049
No. Actually, I can't give
that up; it's my favorite thing.

03:47.117 --> 03:48.885
But I'll give you
five pigeon dicks.

03:48.952 --> 03:51.688
No. I'm talking about renting
this floor to a person.

03:51.755 --> 03:53.590
At least until I find a job.

03:53.657 --> 03:55.658
- What?
- They wouldn't be involved in my life.

03:55.726 --> 03:57.661
I'll put a lock on
the basement door.

03:57.729 --> 03:59.596
We'll just have to be a
little bit more careful.

03:59.664 --> 04:04.168
Besides, all you really care about
is losing your bachelor pad.

04:04.236 --> 04:06.938
<i>You can't take this
away from me, Ryan.</i>

04:07.006 --> 04:09.174
<i>This is who I am!</i>

04:10.877 --> 04:13.312
What is this?

04:13.380 --> 04:16.515
As you can see, Chris, the room
gets plenty of natural light.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.451
I have to say, I'm a
bit of a clean-freak,

04:18.519 --> 04:20.185
and this place looks spotless.

04:20.254 --> 04:22.422
There's nothing wrong
with being a clean-freak.

04:22.489 --> 04:24.457
Oh, and I know that
there's a towel bar missing.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.426
I'll put a new one in tonight.

04:26.493 --> 04:29.028
And there's also a closet
here; it's got plenty of space.

04:29.096 --> 04:31.998
This is perfect.
I'll take it.

04:32.066 --> 04:34.901
Great! Well, a-assuming
the credit check goes well,

04:34.969 --> 04:37.036
I'll just plan on e-mailing
you the lease tomorrow.

04:37.104 --> 04:38.671
Looking forward to living together.

04:39.673 --> 04:41.608
[Wilfred panting]

04:41.675 --> 04:45.345
Ryan, I'm Jonesing here.
I've barely smelt or tasted

04:45.413 --> 04:47.414
anything putrid in over 12 hours.

04:47.482 --> 04:49.516
I'm not gonna let you
sabotage this, Wilfred.

04:49.584 --> 04:51.351
I'm getting a roommate...
that roommate.

04:51.419 --> 04:53.955
Come on, Ryan, can't
you at least...

04:54.022 --> 04:56.090
Loafers with no socks?

04:56.158 --> 04:58.793
I'll bet you got some
moist, sweaty toes in there.

04:58.861 --> 05:01.696
C-Can I just have a
little taste, Ryan?

05:01.763 --> 05:03.464
Come on, man!
I'm freakin' out here!

05:03.532 --> 05:05.533
Just l-let me suck
your little pinky toe!

05:05.601 --> 05:07.101
Wilfred, no!

05:07.169 --> 05:09.370
I'll suck your dick
to suck your toes.

05:09.438 --> 05:11.305
[knocking]

05:11.373 --> 05:12.941
[panting]

05:14.677 --> 05:16.678
Hey, I'm here about the apartment.

05:16.746 --> 05:19.881
Uh, right.
You must be Anne.

05:19.949 --> 05:23.118
- Did you jog here or something?
- No.

05:25.488 --> 05:29.358
Onion rings grease.
[panting] Cheetos powder.

05:29.426 --> 05:33.429
Barbecue sauce.
Well, hello, napkin pants.

05:33.497 --> 05:35.064
Listen, uh, thank you
for stopping by,

05:35.132 --> 05:37.000
but the apartment's
actually taken, so...

05:37.067 --> 05:41.173
What? Oh!
That sucks!

05:41.641 --> 05:44.310
- Are you serious?
- Ryan: Yeah.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.946
Man, talk about a rough month.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.817
First my boyfriend
doesn't make parole.

05:49.885 --> 05:52.522
Then my grandma dies from
diabetes, which is, like,

05:52.589 --> 05:55.093
a huge bummer, 'cause
she's, like, my best friend.

05:55.161 --> 05:57.497
And then my grandpa
kicks me out of the house,

05:57.565 --> 06:00.268
so I go back to pick up
some shit I left behind,

06:00.335 --> 06:03.338
- and guess what?
- What?

06:03.405 --> 06:06.774
He just blasts me in the leg
with an air gun full of rock salt.

06:06.841 --> 06:08.075
[Ryan groans]

06:08.143 --> 06:10.512
Jesus.
I'm... sorry.

06:10.579 --> 06:14.083
Oh, it's not so bad.
When I bend my leg like this,

06:14.151 --> 06:16.319
my knee looks like
a mountaintop, you know,

06:16.386 --> 06:19.923
with all the little craters.
Like in Hawaii.

06:19.991 --> 06:21.858
<i>So that's pretty cool.</i>

06:21.893 --> 06:23.560
You know, my tongue's always
wanted to visit Hawaii.

06:23.628 --> 06:29.232
Anyways... here's my e-mail,
in case that other guy flakes.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.336
Oh. Oh, man, I'm sorry.

06:32.404 --> 06:34.338
It was nice meeting you.

06:41.145 --> 06:44.548
- So, when can she move in?
- Are you kidding?

06:44.616 --> 06:46.283
Ryan, before you make
a rash decision,

06:46.351 --> 06:48.952
there's something you need
to know about that woman.

06:49.020 --> 06:52.589
She has a bag of two-day-old
egg rolls in her backpack.

06:54.159 --> 06:55.792
I'm going with Chris.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.727
You're gonna have to get
your gross fix somewhere else.

06:57.795 --> 07:01.264
Gross fix?
I am an Epicurean!

07:09.506 --> 07:11.374
Oh, hey, roomie.

07:18.415 --> 07:19.849
[TV playing indistinctly]

07:23.354 --> 07:27.423
Wilfred! [pats leg]
Come here.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.061
How the hell did this happen?

07:31.129 --> 07:32.295
It was pretty simple, actually.

07:32.363 --> 07:33.963
I sent a signed rental
agreement to Anne

07:34.031 --> 07:35.665
from your Yahoo account
while you were out.

07:35.733 --> 07:38.267
I also e-mailed all
your friends and family

07:38.335 --> 07:40.503
about this great new
penis-enlargement supplement.

07:40.571 --> 07:44.107
- I really believe in it.
- I'm kicking her out.

07:44.175 --> 07:46.977
Then you'll be on the hook
for $3,000, plus moving costs.

07:47.045 --> 07:49.212
- You put that in the lease?
- It's pretty standard.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.182
No. You're just trying to make it
impossible for me to get rid of her.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.251
- This is a disaster!
- Look, I realize

07:54.319 --> 07:56.854
Anne was only your second
favorite roommate choice,

07:56.922 --> 08:01.292
but guess what, she's paying
three months' rent up front.

08:01.359 --> 08:04.161
Give her a chance;
get to know her.

08:04.229 --> 08:06.697
You might be surprised
by what she has to offer.

08:09.601 --> 08:11.569
<i>[knocking]
Anne: Come in.</i>

08:12.905 --> 08:15.388
Good morning.
Sleep well?

08:15.485 --> 08:18.076
No!
I had the worst night sweats ever.

08:18.144 --> 08:20.379
<i>Took off all my clothes,</i>

08:20.447 --> 08:22.915
just slept on top
of my covers naked.

08:22.982 --> 08:26.084
Had to let myself, like... air out.

08:26.152 --> 08:30.155
Uh, l-listen, I-I think we
sort of rushed into this...

08:30.223 --> 08:31.823
roommate situation.

08:31.891 --> 08:33.225
You know, since we'll
be living together,

08:33.292 --> 08:34.860
maybe we should get
to know each other.

08:34.927 --> 08:37.662
- Totally.
- Like, what do you do for a living?

08:37.730 --> 08:39.931
I run a small Internet business.

08:39.999 --> 08:42.033
- Really?
- Yeah, started it myself.

08:42.101 --> 08:44.635
Attracted investors,
built up a user base.

08:44.703 --> 08:48.172
Wow. Is it media-related
or more social networking?

08:48.240 --> 08:50.508
Oh, people pay to watch me eat.

08:50.575 --> 08:56.513
- So you're, like, a food critic?
- No. I just eat food on my webcam.

08:56.581 --> 08:58.248
<i>It's a great job, actually.
[chuckles]</i>

08:58.316 --> 09:00.317
I mean, I'm not naive.

09:00.385 --> 09:03.521
I realize that most
of my clients are...

09:03.588 --> 09:06.156
you know... men,

09:06.224 --> 09:09.426
but [sighs]...
I love being my own boss.

09:09.494 --> 09:11.595
Basically, you get paid
a shit-load of money

09:11.663 --> 09:13.530
to eat three meals a day.

09:13.598 --> 09:17.968
And the second I get a creepy
vibe from someone, I ban them.

09:18.036 --> 09:20.237
[electronic tone sounds]

09:20.305 --> 09:24.374
- Wait, uh, are you working right now?
- Yeah.

09:24.442 --> 09:29.880
Ooh, hold on. I got a private
session request coming in.

09:29.948 --> 09:31.949
[mouth full] Oh, hey, Frank.

09:32.016 --> 09:34.351
<i>Hey, Anne. Hey, that
sandwich looks a little dry.</i>

09:34.419 --> 09:36.653
<i>I was thinking...
maybe you could put</i>

09:36.721 --> 09:38.422
<i>some more of that dijonnaise on it?</i>

09:38.490 --> 09:40.491
You got it, Frank.

09:42.394 --> 09:44.595
Ooh...

09:44.663 --> 09:45.896
<i>[quietly] That's perfect.</i>

09:45.964 --> 09:48.031
<i>Oh, and where'd your
lesbian friend go?</i>

09:48.099 --> 09:50.934
<i>I want to watch her eat
some chicken nuggets.</i>

09:53.839 --> 09:55.172
[moaning]

09:55.240 --> 09:57.642
[chuckles]

09:59.578 --> 10:00.745
[sighs]

10:00.813 --> 10:02.880
This is torture.

10:02.948 --> 10:06.885
Anne came down this morning
wearing only her nightshirt,

10:06.952 --> 10:10.655
sat on the living room chair
and basically Sharon Stone'd me.

10:10.723 --> 10:12.390
Ugh.

10:12.458 --> 10:15.493
It's only been two weeks,
but it feels like two months.

10:15.561 --> 10:18.697
<i>I don't think our situation's
changed all that much.</i>

10:18.765 --> 10:22.767
- Really? [wheezing]
- Not in any way I can think of, no.

10:22.835 --> 10:24.669
[wheezing]

10:27.740 --> 10:30.842
- What are you doing?
- Anne's bed sheet.

10:30.910 --> 10:35.413
Unlike you, she doesn't have
iron-fisted rules about snacking in bed.

10:35.481 --> 10:36.947
Uh, yes, Bear,

10:37.015 --> 10:39.417
I am really going for my
fifth Nilla Wafer crumb.

10:39.484 --> 10:41.252
I didn't realize there was a limit

10:41.320 --> 10:43.588
to how many Nilla Wafer
crumbs I could eat!

10:43.656 --> 10:45.824
What did you call me?

10:45.891 --> 10:49.060
Well, if you're referring to
the fact that I enjoy blues

10:49.128 --> 10:52.998
and like to travel, then yes,
I guess I am a blues traveler.

10:53.065 --> 10:55.334
Wilfred, have you looked
in the mirror lately?

10:55.401 --> 10:57.402
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

10:57.470 --> 11:00.138
There's some new fat
dog hanging out in there.

11:00.206 --> 11:03.041
I made fun of him yesterday
for, like, three hours.

11:03.109 --> 11:06.945
That dog is you. You keep
eating all the food Anne drops.

11:07.013 --> 11:08.680
Me, fat?

11:08.748 --> 11:13.203
Is that why that dog in the mirror
keeps saying such hurtful things?

11:13.238 --> 11:14.686
[phone chimes]
Yes!

11:14.754 --> 11:16.588
[sighs] Thank God.

11:16.656 --> 11:19.491
I got a job interview at
Silverstein and Goldblatt.

11:19.559 --> 11:21.893
- Interview?
- The faster I get a job,

11:21.961 --> 11:24.362
the faster I can afford
to break Anne's lease.

11:24.430 --> 11:27.398
As a lawyer? But you hated
working at your dad's firm.

11:27.466 --> 11:30.067
You said you used to sit in
your car in the parking lot every

11:30.068 --> 11:32.669
morning, dreading the idea
of setting foot in that place.

11:32.737 --> 11:34.171
It wasn't about being a lawyer.

11:34.239 --> 11:37.007
I hated working for my dad.

11:37.475 --> 11:39.075
You just don't want me to get a job

11:39.143 --> 11:40.443
because of your parasitic
relationship with Anne.

11:40.511 --> 11:44.647
Anne is a friend to me,
nothing more!

11:44.715 --> 11:47.083
So I didn't spend last
night watching you wring out

11:47.150 --> 11:49.585
the armpits of her sweaty
T-shirts into a Cologne bottle?

11:51.722 --> 11:55.124
Oh...!
Oh, that is horrid.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.894
Hey! Looking good.

11:58.962 --> 12:01.263
[chuckles] Yeah. I'm just
heading off to an interview.

12:01.331 --> 12:05.234
With a law firm, actually.
A pretty big one, so...

12:05.302 --> 12:07.870
Oh, that's exciting.
Good luck.

12:07.938 --> 12:11.207
By the way, are you renting
out a room in your house?

12:11.275 --> 12:13.776
Uh... because the other morning,
I saw this woman...

12:13.844 --> 12:16.146
and I'm not accusing
her of anything...

12:16.214 --> 12:19.115
but I saw her take my newspaper
and walk into your house.

12:19.183 --> 12:20.883
Uh, she's just...

12:20.951 --> 12:25.122
a-a family friend who needed
a place to stay for a few weeks.

12:25.189 --> 12:26.923
She should be gone soon.

12:26.991 --> 12:29.493
I'll-I'll talk to her
about the paper.

12:29.561 --> 12:31.828
Good luck.

12:31.896 --> 12:34.698
Do you have any mass
tort experience.

12:34.766 --> 12:37.067
Technically, no, but I
published a series of articles

12:37.135 --> 12:40.004
about the Fen-Phen case in the
Stanford Law Review in 2005.

12:40.071 --> 12:42.306
- Mm.
- It was very well received.

12:42.374 --> 12:44.909
I actually brought a
copy with me today.

12:44.977 --> 12:46.511
What is that?

12:48.848 --> 12:52.251
It's just a... thing.

12:54.855 --> 12:57.790
What? Oh, I'm just punching
an extra hole in my collar.

12:57.858 --> 13:01.060
I think it shrunk because Jenna
put it in the dryer or something.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.962
I don't give a shit
about your collar.

13:03.030 --> 13:05.331
I know what you did.
That thing?

13:05.399 --> 13:09.535
Uh, thing? You got to be
a little bit more specific.

13:09.603 --> 13:12.538
You sabotaged my job interview!

13:12.606 --> 13:17.010
You're damn right I did!
I will not stand idly...

13:17.078 --> 13:19.646
I will not stand...

13:19.714 --> 13:24.051
I will not sit idly by
and let you kick Anne out.

13:24.118 --> 13:26.253
<i>Oh, good, you're home.</i>

13:26.320 --> 13:30.707
So, I kind of caused a plumbing
issue upstairs, and I'd plunge

13:30.708 --> 13:35.095
it myself, but my gout is back
this week with a vengeance.

13:35.163 --> 13:36.597
I can barely...

13:36.665 --> 13:38.165
[groans, inhales sharply]

13:38.233 --> 13:42.402
I can't take this anymore!
You are impossible to live with.

13:42.470 --> 13:45.238
<i>You're sloppy and unhygienic;</i>

13:45.306 --> 13:48.408
you blurt out weird, random
shit that no one cares about;

13:48.476 --> 13:50.477
you stole my neighbor's
newspaper; and your job,

13:50.545 --> 13:53.580
it's basically a creepy
type of fetish porn.

13:53.648 --> 13:55.682
Your life is a mess!

13:55.750 --> 13:58.518
And the worst part about it is
you have no idea.

13:58.586 --> 14:00.354
Or maybe you just don't care.

14:00.421 --> 14:02.923
If I could afford it, I
would have kicked you out

14:02.991 --> 14:04.357
the second you moved in.

14:06.761 --> 14:09.463
Anne?
Anne, I appreciate you.

14:09.531 --> 14:11.865
Thanks to you, I've
become a better individual!

14:11.933 --> 14:13.433
I need...

14:13.501 --> 14:14.701
[groans]

14:15.936 --> 14:17.704
[weakly] Ryan...

14:29.455 --> 14:33.759
Anne...
I'm sorry. [sighs]

14:33.826 --> 14:36.461
You know, you might find
this hard to believe, Ryan,

14:36.529 --> 14:39.865
but you're not the first person
to criticize me and my lifestyle.

14:39.933 --> 14:41.400
<i>[Wilfred in distance]
Don't worry, Anne!</i>

14:41.468 --> 14:44.002
<i>I'm coming up to defend
you from his harsh words!</i>

14:44.070 --> 14:46.437
Look, I-I shouldn't have
blown up at you like that.

14:46.505 --> 14:48.874
I-I didn't mean for it
to come out that way.

14:48.941 --> 14:50.876
That was wrong of me.

14:50.944 --> 14:54.413
[sighs] You... you really
think my life is a mess?

14:54.481 --> 14:58.751
For what it's worth, it's not like
I've got my life together right now.

14:58.818 --> 15:02.587
I... I was a lawyer,
and now I'm unemployed.

15:02.655 --> 15:04.756
<i>[Wilfred wheezing]
Almost there.</i>

15:04.824 --> 15:08.093
I'm just saying, maybe we're
both in a rut right now.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.395
Maybe-maybe we could
help each other out.

15:10.463 --> 15:13.899
I-I'd just hate to see
you leave like this.

15:13.967 --> 15:17.269
<i>Wilfred: God, did you add,
like, a hundred stairs here?</i>

15:17.336 --> 15:21.273
Well, I have to admit, my
grandpa's said some pretty

15:21.274 --> 15:25.210
mean shit to me over the
years, and it always hurt.

15:25.278 --> 15:27.713
But I never knew
what to do about it.

15:27.781 --> 15:30.416
You're, like, the first
person to offer to help.

15:30.484 --> 15:33.920
I want to help. I really do.

15:33.988 --> 15:36.222
<i>[Wilfred wheezing]</i>

15:36.290 --> 15:38.324
[panting]

15:42.562 --> 15:45.197
[inhales]

15:45.265 --> 15:47.233
[continues panting]

15:47.300 --> 15:48.267
[birds chirping]

15:48.335 --> 15:49.735
[door opens]

15:49.803 --> 15:53.173
- Hey. Looking good.
- Aw, thanks. [chuckles]

15:53.240 --> 15:55.341
- You still excited about the job?
- Well, the first day

15:55.409 --> 15:58.578
was pretty cool, so I
assume day two will be fun.

15:58.645 --> 16:01.848
I mean, the temp agency only
has me doing paperwork and stuff,

16:01.916 --> 16:05.919
but the insurance business is...
actually interesting.

16:05.987 --> 16:09.089
That's great.
Oh. Um, bagel for the road?

16:09.157 --> 16:11.993
Uh, no. Just coffee, thanks.

16:13.996 --> 16:17.065
I know you were against
it, but you have to admit,

16:17.132 --> 16:19.601
Anne's really turned a corner.

16:19.669 --> 16:22.704
- What's that?
- Nothing.

16:22.772 --> 16:26.575
[sighs] It's just that...
lately I've been having some trouble

16:26.643 --> 16:30.045
reaching certain areas of my
body that require cleaning.

16:30.113 --> 16:32.081
It's probably just something
to do with flexibility.

16:32.148 --> 16:35.417
[groans] I just need to
stretch a little more is all.

16:35.485 --> 16:38.020
But, uh, for now,
I've been getting by

16:38.087 --> 16:41.089
with the help of a,
uh, tongue on a stick.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.627
[moans]

16:45.695 --> 16:47.830
Wilfred, your weight has
gotten out of control.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.765
You're gonna give
yourself a heart attack.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.934
For the last time, I am not fat.

16:52.001 --> 16:54.102
I'm just a little
on the husky side.

16:54.170 --> 16:56.238
Come on, we're going for a walk.

16:56.306 --> 17:00.676
- Pick up the pace, big guy.
- [groans] "Big guy"?

17:00.743 --> 17:03.311
Do you not see this
Hawaiian shirt I'm wearing?

17:03.379 --> 17:05.946
I reckon it makes me look
like one of the Strokes.

17:06.015 --> 17:08.415
Ah. Is that why you wore
a giant white T-shirt

17:08.483 --> 17:10.352
when you went swimming
in the ocean yesterday?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.387
Uh, sunburn?

17:12.454 --> 17:14.556
[yelling]

17:14.623 --> 17:17.459
Aw, forget it!

17:17.526 --> 17:20.328
I'm not gonna let you ruin
me the way you ruined Anne.

17:20.396 --> 17:21.762
I didn't ruin anyone.

17:21.830 --> 17:24.132
What, you think Anne
was better off before?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.435
Sure, she wasn't clean or refined,

17:26.502 --> 17:29.804
she didn't not use your
computer power cord as a belt,

17:29.872 --> 17:34.676
but she loved her life,
openly, freely, unashamed.

17:34.743 --> 17:37.145
You ripped the horn
off the unicorn, Ryan,

17:37.213 --> 17:39.414
<i>because you wanted to
make it a normal horse,</i>

17:39.482 --> 17:41.282
but it'll never be a normal horse,

17:41.350 --> 17:44.986
because now there's that
circular scab in its forehead.

17:45.054 --> 17:47.054
- I'm helping her, Wilfred.
- What you're doing to her

17:47.122 --> 17:51.592
is exactly what your father did
to you your entire adult life.

17:51.659 --> 17:53.060
That's not true.

17:53.128 --> 17:55.529
Anne is happier now
than she's ever been.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.163
Are you sure about that?

17:59.299 --> 18:00.533
Is that Anne?

18:00.601 --> 18:05.772
Sitting alone in her parked
car before work. Sound familiar?

18:14.281 --> 18:15.748
Ryan, hey.

18:15.816 --> 18:17.450
I-I thought you were
going to work today.

18:17.518 --> 18:20.670
I, uh, I-I was.
I meant to, but once I

18:20.671 --> 18:23.822
started driving there,
I just had to pull over.

18:23.890 --> 18:25.824
You said the first day was cool.

18:25.892 --> 18:29.828
It was awful.
They put me in a cubicle

18:29.896 --> 18:32.964
and had me enter data
into a spreadsheet.

18:33.032 --> 18:35.867
And then at lunch, I
just sat there in silence

18:35.935 --> 18:39.537
while my coworkers talked
about a sale on drapery runners.

18:39.605 --> 18:42.440
I didn't want to open
my mouth, 'cause I knew

18:42.507 --> 18:45.943
I'd say something weird
or talk about my back fat.

18:46.011 --> 18:49.880
And then I was afraid I'd spill
stuff on my clothes, you know.

18:49.948 --> 18:51.816
And the blouse I was
wearing was so tight.

18:51.884 --> 18:54.552
This one's so tight, it's
just, like, suffocating me.

18:54.620 --> 18:57.488
And this bun is, like,
giving me a migraine.

18:57.556 --> 18:59.524
I can't even think!

18:59.591 --> 19:00.791
[sighs]

19:00.859 --> 19:05.363
I'm sorry, Ryan. I know a lot of
people hate their jobs, and they just

19:05.364 --> 19:09.867
got to make it through their day...
you know, you've got to be strong.

19:09.935 --> 19:13.504
Anne, no. Th-this isn't right.
This isn't you.

19:13.572 --> 19:16.107
Honestly, I-I'm the
one who should be sorry.

19:16.175 --> 19:17.541
For what?

19:19.344 --> 19:20.978
[panting]

19:21.046 --> 19:23.714
For ripping the horn
off the unicorn.

19:26.317 --> 19:29.853
That actually sounded kind
of cheesy when you said it.

19:32.723 --> 19:38.896
Look at her. She's so...
comfortable with herself.

19:38.963 --> 19:42.699
- Why was I so threatened by her?
- Maybe you were jealous?

19:42.767 --> 19:46.170
That's true.
I could never live like her.

19:46.237 --> 19:47.671
- Why not?
- Come on.

19:47.739 --> 19:51.241
You know what my life is like.
It's pathetic. I'm always just...

19:51.309 --> 19:53.676
Hanging out and smoking weed
with your neighbor's dog?

19:53.744 --> 19:55.211
- Exactly.
- Talking about

19:55.279 --> 19:59.349
deep shit, laughing our asses off,
going on crazy adventures,

19:59.416 --> 20:02.285
having a truly unique
and remarkable friendship?

20:02.353 --> 20:03.853
I mean, sure,
you don't know exactly

20:03.921 --> 20:05.923
what you want to do
with your life yet,

20:05.990 --> 20:08.192
but at least you know
what you don't want to do.

20:08.259 --> 20:11.929
Doesn't sound so bad
when you say it like that.

20:11.997 --> 20:14.832
No, it doesn't, mate.

20:14.900 --> 20:19.003
And when you say "smoking weed,"
what you mean to say is,

20:19.071 --> 20:22.233
"smoking that dank-ass O.G.
kush mixed with White Widow."

20:22.268 --> 20:22.974
[chuckles]

20:23.042 --> 20:26.010
What are <i>you</i> looking at, fat boy?!

20:27.980 --> 20:31.216
I told you, Wilfred, that's you.

20:31.283 --> 20:35.287
No. That's Alec Baldwin
from It's Complicated.

20:35.354 --> 20:40.658
Holy shit, that <i>is</i> me.
I'm fat, dude.

20:46.501 --> 20:49.435
So, I finally introduced
Jenna to Anne.

20:49.503 --> 20:51.337
I came clean about her
being my roommate

20:51.405 --> 20:53.073
and me needing the money and all.

20:53.540 --> 20:56.142
I actually didn't feel as
embarrassed as I thought I would.

20:56.210 --> 20:58.111
'Cause you have no
reason to be, mate.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.650
Of course it's me, Bear.
Who else would it be?

21:03.718 --> 21:08.455
Oh, what, you think I can't talk
and satisfy you at the same time?

21:10.925 --> 21:12.726
<i>[quietly] I've got to take a piss.</i>

21:12.794 --> 21:15.395
<i>Finish Bear off for me?</i>
