00:10.500 --> 00:14.667
of a quad-less house.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.583
- [sighs]

00:14.709 --> 00:16.583
I love it when the kids spend

00:16.625 --> 00:18.000
the weekend at your mother's.

00:18.041 --> 00:19.375
- Oh, I wish it was

00:18.041 --> 00:19.375
a longer weekend.

00:19.417 --> 00:20.458
- Oh.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.542
- Uh, hello?

00:30.041 --> 00:32.417
Welcome home.

00:32.458 --> 00:36.000
- We missed you so much.

00:32.458 --> 00:36.000
These weekends are way too long.

00:36.041 --> 00:39.959
- Whoo-hoo!

00:36.041 --> 00:39.959
Oh, Tommy, Tommy,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.250
my little salami.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.250
Get over here

00:42.291 --> 00:43.667
and hug your mommy.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.500
- Uh-huh.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.500
I hate it when you call me

00:45.542 --> 00:47.375
your little salami.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.375
I'm a big salami now.

- Anybody else never

00:49.417 --> 00:53.000
want to eat salami again?

00:53.041 --> 00:54.917
- Thanks for letting

00:53.041 --> 00:54.917
me sleep over.

You know I'm--I'm not

00:54.959 --> 00:58.000

00:58.041 --> 01:02.583
But in the day, people are

00:58.041 --> 01:02.583
always honking and waving at me.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.542
- Oh, yeah,

01:02.625 --> 01:04.542
they're waving, Grammy.

01:04.583 --> 01:07.041
- Well, if you'll excuse me,

01:04.583 --> 01:07.041
I have to go make

01:07.083 --> 01:09.417
a deposit in my local branch.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.083

01:12.125 --> 01:14.834
- He never goes at Grammy's.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.834
The porcelain figurines

01:14.875 --> 01:17.375

- Especially when we whisper

01:17.417 --> 01:19.000
through the vent

01:19.041 --> 01:22.041
to make him think

01:19.041 --> 01:22.041
that they're talking.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.291
- We see you.

01:25.333 --> 01:28.417
- Other than tormenting their

01:25.333 --> 01:28.417
brother, did the kids behave?

01:28.458 --> 01:31.875
- Of course they did.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.875
They're Grammy's little angels.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.709
- We're always on

01:31.917 --> 01:33.709
our best behavior

01:33.750 --> 01:35.125
when we're at Grammy's house.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.625
- That's only because

01:35.166 --> 01:36.625
if you behave,

01:36.667 --> 01:39.250
she rewards you

01:36.667 --> 01:39.250
with some really cool gift.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.208
- What?

01:39.291 --> 01:41.208
- That's not true.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.458
- Frankly, I'm insulted.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.458
- Yeah.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.375
- So did we get

01:43.500 --> 01:46.375
our good-behavior gift yet?

01:46.417 --> 01:48.458
- Well, I was gonna

01:46.417 --> 01:48.458
unpack first.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.083
all: Ugh.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.041
- But I guess I could

01:50.125 --> 01:52.041
give it to you now.

01:52.083 --> 01:53.500
all: Yay!

01:53.542 --> 01:56.709
- No, you know what, Mom?

01:53.542 --> 01:56.709
They can wait.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.166
all: Ugh.

01:59.208 --> 02:03.250
- Seriously, why do we

01:59.208 --> 02:03.250
even bother behaving?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.917
- Do you even hear yourselves?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.917
You shouldn't have to be

02:05.959 --> 02:09.083
rewarded for good behavior.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.083
Good behavior is its own reward.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.166
- And it is, Father.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.166
But is this really fair

02:12.208 --> 02:15.542
to Grandmother, whose one joy

02:12.208 --> 02:15.542
is seeing the smiles on her

02:15.583 --> 02:17.875
little grandchildren's faces

02:15.583 --> 02:17.875
when we open

02:17.917 --> 02:19.417
her thoughtful gift?

02:19.458 --> 02:22.291
- How could you do this

02:19.458 --> 02:22.291
to your own mother?

02:22.333 --> 02:24.208
Shame on you, Tommy Salami.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.166
- Mommy, I'm sorry.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.625
- Snap out of it, Salami,

02:27.208 --> 02:29.625
the kids are playing you.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.542
You can open

02:29.667 --> 02:31.542
that gift tomorrow.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.625
- And only if we get some of

02:31.583 --> 02:33.625
that "Grandma's house" behavior

02:33.667 --> 02:35.583
in our own house.

02:35.625 --> 02:38.792
- Come on, Grammy, are you going

02:35.625 --> 02:38.792
to support Salami's baloney?

02:38.834 --> 02:40.792
- Whatever your

02:38.834 --> 02:40.792
parents say goes.

02:40.834 --> 02:43.875
Their house,

02:40.834 --> 02:43.875
their rules.

02:43.917 --> 02:46.542
- You know what,

02:43.917 --> 02:46.542
what's one more day?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.834
We can do this.

02:47.875 --> 02:51.542
- But before we commit,

02:47.875 --> 02:51.542
a moment.

02:51.583 --> 02:54.625
[whispering indistinctly]

02:54.667 --> 02:56.291
- We'd like to know

02:54.667 --> 02:56.291
what the gift is to see

02:56.333 --> 02:58.542
if behaving is worth our while.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.667
- Before we answer, a moment.

03:02.000 --> 03:02.959
No.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.750
all: Ugh.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.542
- Come on, let's go

03:04.792 --> 03:06.542
hide this gift.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.917
- I can't behave

03:08.750 --> 03:10.917
for another day!

03:10.959 --> 03:14.208
- I know, I've got misbehavior

03:10.959 --> 03:14.208
bursting out of me!

03:14.250 --> 03:16.834
- All right, they're hiding

03:14.250 --> 03:16.834
the gift, so we have at least

03:16.875 --> 03:19.709
30 seconds to let this

03:16.875 --> 03:19.709
bad behavior out.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.500
Ready, go!

03:28.792 --> 03:30.625
- So are you kids

03:28.792 --> 03:30.625

Nope.
