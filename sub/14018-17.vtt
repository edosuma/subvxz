NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:08.850 --> 00:12.730
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:12.788 --> 00:14.597
the police who
investigate crime

00:14.656 --> 00:17.466
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:17.526 --> 00:19.233
These are their stories.

00:22.697 --> 00:24.904
You're home early, Mrs. Kiley.
How was your trip?

00:25.467 --> 00:28.141
Oh, best anniversary present
lever had, Michael.

00:28.203 --> 00:29.944
Hey, Mr. K,
long flight?

00:30.005 --> 00:31.985
It's always long when you're
coming home, Michael.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.451
Send the suitcases up,
would you?

00:33.508 --> 00:34.851
Yes.
Your daughter, she...

00:34.910 --> 00:37.049
Oh, May hasn't gone out,
has she? Not this early.

00:37.112 --> 00:38.955
No, no. I haven't
seen her this morning.

00:39.014 --> 00:40.220
Good.

00:46.855 --> 00:50.302
SCOTT: What in the hell
is going on in here?

00:50.358 --> 00:51.530
LENORE: May?

00:52.327 --> 00:53.567
Who are you?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.838
LENORE: May?
Oh, my God.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.108
(BOY COUGHING)

01:00.168 --> 01:03.012
All right, come on.
Get up.

01:03.071 --> 01:05.244
Get out of here,
all of you, right now.

01:05.307 --> 01:07.514
LENORE: May? May?

01:08.310 --> 01:09.516
Andy?

01:10.312 --> 01:13.122
Mr. Kiley.
I was... I was just...

01:13.482 --> 01:15.052
Cover yourself.

01:16.384 --> 01:19.126
Andy, what is going on here?

01:19.187 --> 01:21.224
May had a couple of kids over.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.734
LENORE: Oh, my God!

01:22.791 --> 01:25.294
Lenore? Lenore!

01:26.061 --> 01:27.233
(LENORE CRYING)

01:28.296 --> 01:29.570
Oh. my...

01:29.898 --> 01:30.933
Oh!

01:30.999 --> 01:33.775
Oh, my God.

01:39.574 --> 01:42.646
It started out, you
know, just a few kids.

01:43.245 --> 01:44.349
What time?

01:45.013 --> 01:46.014
Around 8:00, 8:30.

01:46.081 --> 01:47.560
You go to school with May?

01:47.616 --> 01:49.653
I used to.
Before I went to Williams.

01:49.718 --> 01:50.924
I'm on spring break.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.262
You were here with
a girl, right? A date?

01:53.321 --> 01:56.734
Yeah, she's from Dalton. I met her
at the party, then we crashed.

01:56.791 --> 01:58.896
You talk to May at the party?

01:58.960 --> 02:01.964
May was in the bedroom with
somebody. I don't know who.

02:03.131 --> 02:04.804
They were having a bad fight.

02:04.866 --> 02:06.072
You hear a gunshot?

02:06.134 --> 02:08.341
I didn't hang around
outside the door.

02:08.402 --> 02:10.076
I mean,
with the music that loud.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.482
Wait here.
How are the parents?

02:13.542 --> 02:16.489
Well, Mom's calling her doctor,
and Dad's calling his lawyer.

02:16.545 --> 02:19.992
Well, I got this one kid, said he heard
an argument in May's bedroom. You?

02:20.048 --> 02:24.053
No. Some of the kids she hung out with
thought she was the life of the party.

02:24.452 --> 02:25.863
Not anymore.

03:14.936 --> 03:19.214
What happened last night
was not like her.

03:20.709 --> 03:24.748
Up until this year, she
never even went to parties.

03:26.047 --> 03:27.958
We worried about her.

03:28.016 --> 03:31.589
A kid needs a social life,

03:32.887 --> 03:36.562
and May was always
such a loner.

03:38.994 --> 03:44.774
Until last year, and then
she just seemed to blossom.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.343
Before you went to England...

03:49.404 --> 03:53.113
There was never
any talk of a party.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.512
What about drugs?

03:55.577 --> 03:58.649
If you found any there, they
were not hers or her friends'.

03:58.713 --> 04:01.592
At least her close friends'.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.221
CURTIS: Are you sure?

04:03.284 --> 04:04.285
Yes.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.192
What about boyfriends?

04:06.254 --> 04:07.358
LENORE: May's crowd,

04:08.423 --> 04:10.630
they don't really date
like we did.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.903
Can you give us some names?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.567
That would be Chris Landauer.

04:17.999 --> 04:19.774
She's in her class.

04:21.536 --> 04:25.609
And Julia Buckley.

04:27.275 --> 04:29.255
She's a year behind her.

04:31.279 --> 04:35.785
Sometime after 8:00, 8:30, kids,
friends, friends of friends,

04:35.850 --> 04:37.887
strangers who heard about
the party started showing up.

04:37.952 --> 04:40.694
Doorman calls up to the apartment,
"Hey, are these your guests?"

04:40.755 --> 04:43.531
May wants to be popular so she
says, "Sure, send them up."

04:43.591 --> 04:45.901
Yeah, so at some point
things get out of hand.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.338
One kid said he heard May arguing
with a guy around 11:00.

04:48.396 --> 04:50.569
Now another kid,
Melinda Suarez,

04:50.632 --> 04:52.270
heard a shot maybe
half an hour later.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.006
But she thought it
came from the street.

04:54.069 --> 04:55.207
The gun from the room?

04:55.270 --> 04:58.444
A 22 caliber. Unregistered.
Latent's working on the prints.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.507
Gunshot residue?

04:59.574 --> 05:00.575
Working on it.

05:01.076 --> 05:02.578
11:30 to what?

05:02.644 --> 05:03.952
What time did the
parents find May?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.047
6:00.

05:05.113 --> 05:07.184
6:00.
Six and a half hours.

05:07.248 --> 05:09.524
None of the kids went in
the room, saw the body?

05:09.584 --> 05:11.154
The door closed?
It's possible.

05:11.219 --> 05:13.665
The parents got there, there
were bodies all over the place.

05:13.722 --> 05:16.202
Sleeping, drugged, drunk.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.600
What about these Polaroids?

05:17.659 --> 05:19.730
Well, you can get arrested for
putting them on the Internet,

05:19.794 --> 05:21.205
but no shots of May.

05:21.262 --> 05:22.900
No diary or phonebook?

05:22.964 --> 05:23.999
Working on that, too.

05:24.065 --> 05:26.272
Now, some other people
we talked to said,

05:26.334 --> 05:28.473
"May was shy, but
everybody liked her."

05:28.536 --> 05:31.517
"Fun, not wild.
A little naive."

05:31.573 --> 05:33.211
If she'd been a little
more streetwise...

05:33.274 --> 05:35.015
Maybe she would've been
killed on the street.

05:35.076 --> 05:37.386
Latent got three sets
of prints off the gun.

05:37.445 --> 05:40.483
The girl, an unknown, and
this mook, Maxwell Paris, 23,

05:40.548 --> 05:42.755
just did six months
at Rikers for dealing.

05:43.818 --> 05:45.491
CURTIS: So, how'd you end
up at the party, Max?

05:45.553 --> 05:47.157
BRISCOE: Somebody decides
to throw a party,

05:47.222 --> 05:50.032
they just put your name
on the top of the list?

05:50.091 --> 05:52.332
What do you do,
supply the party favors?

05:52.994 --> 05:53.995
Am I under arrest?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.097
BRISCOE: For what?

05:55.163 --> 05:56.540
How long were you at the party?

05:57.298 --> 05:58.333
A couple of hours.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.400
Who'd you talk to?

05:59.467 --> 06:00.673
You talk to May?

06:00.735 --> 06:03.272
Who?
CURTIS: Your hostess.

06:03.338 --> 06:05.113
We found this gun there, Max.

06:05.173 --> 06:07.050
It's got your prints on it.
Now, why would that be?

06:08.109 --> 06:09.816
Why would your prints
be on this gun, Max?

06:09.878 --> 06:12.119
I just brought it, okay?

06:12.180 --> 06:14.490
Some kid found it in my pocket,

06:14.549 --> 06:16.529
started showing
it around to people.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.029
I tried to look
for the thing later,

06:18.086 --> 06:20.623
but this blondie,
she could tell you.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.660
I was with her from the minute I
walked in the door till when I left.

06:23.725 --> 06:24.726
Blondie got a name?

06:25.093 --> 06:28.404
Well, everybody's got a name.
Cindy, I think. Mary.

06:30.231 --> 06:33.212
All right,
you recognize blondie?

06:34.169 --> 06:36.206
Yeah, yeah, that's
her, that's her.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.044
GLORIA: If my mother ever finds
out that I was with that guy...

06:40.775 --> 06:42.448
Tell us about the gun.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.456
It was a gun.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.888
Well, a lot of your
friends carry guns?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.292
No. Look, I didn't
even know he had it.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.125
Some kid took it out
of his pants pocket.

06:51.186 --> 06:53.166
BRISCOE: And Max didn't
try to stop him?

06:53.221 --> 06:55.326
Well, his pants were on the
other side of the room.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.126
(SIGHS) Okay.

06:58.993 --> 07:00.267
BRISCOE: Were you
with him the whole time?

07:00.328 --> 07:03.002
Did he go off by himself? Get a beer?
Anything like that?

07:03.064 --> 07:06.443
No, I came up in the
elevator with him and...

07:07.068 --> 07:08.979
Well, I didn't know that
he was going to the party.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.677
We were both crashers, so...

07:14.242 --> 07:17.587
Well, I don't know, he pretty much
kept an eye on me the whole night.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.886
I think he was scared I was going
to run out on him or something.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.794
Yeah, he'd lose
his meal ticket.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.830
Look, I know what goes on.

07:23.885 --> 07:25.489
I mean, if you only
saw the dweebs

07:25.553 --> 07:27.464
that I usually go out
with from my school.

07:27.522 --> 07:30.025
And this guy Max is,
what, exciting?

07:30.325 --> 07:34.535
Real. I mean,
he really does stuff.

07:35.296 --> 07:36.639
Like time in Rikers.

07:36.698 --> 07:40.236
Look, I'm really sorry about what
happened to Billy's girlfriend,

07:40.301 --> 07:42.645
but Max was with
me the entire night.

07:43.137 --> 07:44.548
Who's Billy?

07:44.606 --> 07:47.109
Billy Fields, the guy who
told me about the party.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.552
He was there with May.

07:48.610 --> 07:49.748
Where can we find him?

07:51.779 --> 07:54.589
I don't know. Greenwich
Paper, down on 12th Street.

07:57.852 --> 08:02.665
Ever since it happened,
it's like a nightmare.

08:03.157 --> 08:06.138
Well, you want to tell us
exactly what happened?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.640
I wanted to
explain it to someone.

08:09.631 --> 08:12.578
My friend Louis said that...
Louis?

08:12.634 --> 08:16.844
Louis Morse. He said
that I should report it.

08:20.341 --> 08:22.116
I was scared.
Hey, that's okay.

08:22.176 --> 08:25.248
Something like this
happens, people get scared.

08:25.813 --> 08:27.793
I didn't know
what to do, you know.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.164
I mean, just a party.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.326
It was just a regular party.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.428
May planned it a while ago, when she heard
her parents were going out of town.

08:38.493 --> 08:40.404
So, what happened at the party?

08:40.461 --> 08:41.837
BILLY: I got there late,

08:42.496 --> 08:45.876
and I was just
taking off my coat

08:45.934 --> 08:48.574
when Louis pulled
me into May's bedroom.

08:49.771 --> 08:54.345
And he had this gun. I don't
know where he got it.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.088
And we were looking at
it when May came in.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.323
And she was hysterical.

09:03.384 --> 09:06.854
She was telling us
how she got this letter,

09:09.590 --> 09:12.935
and that she had AIDS.

09:14.729 --> 09:17.505
And she was crying,
and saying it wasn't fair.

09:18.032 --> 09:22.208
I freaked. I was like, I kept
telling her, "Are you sure?"

09:23.838 --> 09:25.545
She said yes.

09:25.974 --> 09:27.920
I thought maybe I had it, too.

09:29.077 --> 09:30.681
(STUTTERS)

09:30.745 --> 09:33.248
She told me to
put down the gun,

09:33.314 --> 09:36.261
and she picked it up,
and somehow it went off.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.857
I don't even know
what happened then.

09:43.024 --> 09:44.935
I thought I killed her.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.605
And I was scared.

09:47.662 --> 09:50.074
Louis and I,
we just booked together.

09:50.131 --> 09:54.409
God, I mean, I'm so sorry.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.583
We got him in interrogation,
waiting on his lawyer.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.349
She tells him she's got AIDS, he
freaks and accidentally shoots her.

10:03.778 --> 10:04.779
You buy that story?

10:05.046 --> 10:06.081
Well, he's a mess,

10:06.147 --> 10:09.026
but his friend, Louis Morse,
confirms everything.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.289
So, there's a struggle.

10:10.351 --> 10:13.423
Maybe he wanted to kill her because
he was afraid she'd given him AIDS,

10:13.488 --> 10:14.899
and she tried to stop him?

10:14.956 --> 10:17.197
We're having the M.E. check
if the girl was HIV positive,

10:17.258 --> 10:19.465
and if the wound makes
the boy's story possible.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.438
Well, book Max for criminal
possession of the weapon,

10:21.496 --> 10:24.500
charge Billy with murder two,
and talk to May's parents.

10:24.565 --> 10:26.442
Find out what they know
about Billy.

10:27.035 --> 10:29.811
HIV? What are you talking about?
What are they talking about?

10:29.871 --> 10:31.214
We're just trying to confirm...

10:31.272 --> 10:32.376
My daughter's dead,

10:33.174 --> 10:35.120
and you come here
telling me she...

10:35.843 --> 10:37.845
Who told you that?
Mr. Kiley, I...

10:37.912 --> 10:39.516
Whoever told you that
is a liar.

10:39.580 --> 10:41.685
My daughter was
not sexually active.

10:42.717 --> 10:46.187
She was fitted for a diaphragm
a little over a year ago.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.892
She what?

10:48.489 --> 10:50.196
May was a late bloomer.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.663
She came to me
for advice, and I...

10:52.727 --> 10:55.105
Why didn't you tell me this?

10:55.163 --> 10:57.973
Because she was afraid you would
react the way you're reacting.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.941
Who was she sleeping with?

11:02.003 --> 11:03.380
I didn't ask.

11:06.974 --> 11:08.885
What is the detective
looking for?

11:08.943 --> 11:10.889
Oh, he'll be finished
in a minute.

11:11.245 --> 11:14.818
Did May ever talk about
getting tested for HIV?

11:16.751 --> 11:19.630
What can you tell me about
her friend, Billy Fields?

11:19.687 --> 11:21.462
We met him a couple of times.

11:22.623 --> 11:25.365
He seemed like
a very sweet boy.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.267
I didn't know
he was her boyfriend.

11:28.362 --> 11:29.636
(DOOR OPENING)

11:30.131 --> 11:33.806
Found this in one of her school books.
"May, we have to talk."

11:33.868 --> 11:35.677
"It's very important. Lana."

11:35.970 --> 11:36.971
Who's Lana?

11:38.573 --> 11:42.715
There's a Lana Madison
in her chorus.

11:42.777 --> 11:44.984
I don't think they
were friends, though.

11:48.649 --> 11:51.960
May, and this girl from Spence,
Grace Leonard, and me,

11:52.019 --> 11:53.760
we all went out
with the same guy.

11:54.689 --> 11:57.602
Me, about a year
and a half ago,

11:57.658 --> 12:01.333
and then Grace a year ago,
and May nine, 10 months ago.

12:01.395 --> 12:03.170
He bounced from Grace to her.

12:03.231 --> 12:04.505
Who was the guy?

12:04.599 --> 12:07.273
I only know his
street name. Twist.

12:07.869 --> 12:09.405
Do you know
where we can find him?

12:09.470 --> 12:11.814
I don't know. I haven't
seen him around lately.

12:11.873 --> 12:12.943
Does he go to school with you?

12:13.007 --> 12:14.042
No, he's older.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.412
Couple of years.

12:15.476 --> 12:16.477
Do you know where he lives?

12:16.544 --> 12:18.581
No, he just hangs
around the scene.

12:18.646 --> 12:19.784
So, where did you...

12:19.847 --> 12:21.485
LANA: My parents' place.

12:21.549 --> 12:22.892
They were out.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.688
What about May's
current boyfriend?

12:25.753 --> 12:29.530
Billy? He's a shy kid.
You know, more May's speed.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.702
Not like Twist.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.365
I can't imagine him
shooting anybody.

12:34.428 --> 12:36.066
Sounds like you
don't like Twist.

12:36.531 --> 12:40.946
Yeah, well... No, like three
weeks after we broke up,

12:41.402 --> 12:46.010
I ran into him at a party,
and he told me he had AIDS,

12:46.274 --> 12:47.776
so I probably had it,

12:48.176 --> 12:49.678
and then he laughed.

12:50.444 --> 12:51.821
And I thought
it was a sick joke.

12:51.879 --> 12:55.486
He was just trying to get
back at me for dumping him.

12:55.550 --> 12:59.828
But two weeks ago, I had
to go get tested for VD,

13:00.788 --> 13:03.132
and I found out
Twist wasn't joking.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.327
I'm sorry.

13:08.296 --> 13:09.297
What do you guys say?

13:09.363 --> 13:11.969
"Can't do the time,
don't do the crime?"

13:12.867 --> 13:16.872
That's what it feels like. You know,
like I'm some sort of criminal.

13:17.772 --> 13:18.944
You getting help?

13:19.006 --> 13:22.579
Yeah, I got a good doctor. At
least my parents say he's good,

13:23.177 --> 13:25.088
and now they get to
congratulate themselves

13:25.146 --> 13:26.853
on being understanding.

13:28.382 --> 13:31.488
(SIGHS) This Twist, would Grace
know where we can find him?

13:31.552 --> 13:36.001
I tried to contact
Grace, too, to tell her,

13:36.858 --> 13:38.235
but she already knew.

13:39.126 --> 13:40.469
She died.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.370
AIDS.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.407
Pneumonia. Last month.

13:44.465 --> 13:46.411
Look, Twist is a jerk.

13:46.467 --> 13:49.812
Hey, he even bragged about
infecting as many girls as he can.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.679
Taking us all with him.

14:01.649 --> 14:04.255
CURTIS: The M.E. confirmed
that May was HIV positive,

14:04.318 --> 14:06.662
and the angle of the wound makes
the boy's story possible.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.064
We've got the kid's statement.

14:08.122 --> 14:09.430
Confirmation from the witness?

14:09.523 --> 14:12.003
Yes. He saw the fight.
I talked to Billy's lawyer.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.762
What do we know about the boy?

14:13.828 --> 14:15.671
CURTIS: By all reports,
a good kid, good student.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.800
So, we're not talking
a hard case here.

14:17.865 --> 14:20.106
It sounds like it
happened the way he said.

14:20.935 --> 14:23.142
Freaked out, the gun went off.

14:23.204 --> 14:24.842
I'm inclined to make the deal.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.716
Okay. We close
the books on Billy.

14:27.775 --> 14:29.777
I wish they were all this easy.

14:29.844 --> 14:31.585
What about this
other guy, Twist?

14:31.646 --> 14:32.989
VAN BUREN: What about him?

14:33.047 --> 14:35.186
He's purposely infecting
women to kill them.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.353
BRISCOE:
He bragged about it.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.954
Said he was going to take as
many girls with him as he could.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.660
Well, isn't this something we should
hand off to the Health Department?

14:41.722 --> 14:43.258
LT, he's dangerous.

14:43.824 --> 14:45.098
VAN BUREN: I don't know.

14:45.159 --> 14:47.036
CURTIS: It's at least
attempted murder.

14:47.094 --> 14:50.507
And what? We get him to plead down to man two?
It's a stretch.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.635
I vote with Curtis.

14:53.701 --> 14:56.580
It appears we have a good kid who
accidentally killed his girlfriend,

14:56.637 --> 14:59.117
and maybe a bad one who's
deliberately infecting women.

14:59.173 --> 15:00.174
Well, pick him up.

15:00.241 --> 15:02.050
We'll worry about
how to keep him later.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.851
Start with the clinic
where the girl got tested.

15:07.848 --> 15:09.555
MALLON: We get a list
of sexual encounters

15:09.617 --> 15:12.427
from everyone who tests
positive for HIV.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.762
We contact these people,
we urge them to get tested.

15:14.822 --> 15:17.666
We get from them their list of
sexual encounters, and so on.

15:17.725 --> 15:19.796
Well, Lana Madison told
us she got tested here.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.567
This is the letter
you sent her.

15:21.662 --> 15:24.438
We're hoping you traced
the guy who infected her.

15:25.533 --> 15:26.534
The records are confidential.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.979
Hey, we got somebody out there who's
infecting these people on purpose.

15:31.005 --> 15:34.680
All right. I can tell you
in the past three months,

15:34.742 --> 15:38.815
half a dozen girls who tested
positive gave overlapping contacts.

15:39.513 --> 15:40.924
One guy?

15:40.982 --> 15:43.588
We found out he tested positive
about a year and a half ago.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.686
We're gonna need his name.

15:45.019 --> 15:46.692
The rules make no exceptions.

15:46.754 --> 15:48.290
Listen, while we're
standing here talking,

15:48.356 --> 15:50.029
he could be out
infecting somebody else.

15:50.091 --> 15:51.593
If half the time,
money and effort

15:51.659 --> 15:54.037
you're spending trying to find this
guy went into sex education...

15:54.095 --> 15:56.541
We work for the Police Department,
not the School Department.

15:56.597 --> 15:57.974
And I work for
the Health Department,

15:58.032 --> 16:01.309
which does not disclose
confidential information.

16:01.369 --> 16:02.370
Excuse me.

16:03.704 --> 16:05.479
We can't get this kid's name
from the Health Department.

16:05.539 --> 16:06.779
So, we can't get
him off the street.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.286
He'll keep spreading
the disease.

16:09.076 --> 16:11.113
This kind of thing
makes judges very nervous.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.021
We're dealing with a
Constitutional issue here.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.184
The right to privacy.

16:14.248 --> 16:15.852
What about the right to life?

16:15.916 --> 16:18.726
The city health codes are pretty
specific about confidentiality.

16:18.786 --> 16:20.197
So, you're saying what?

16:20.254 --> 16:22.165
We back off and let
this guy spread death

16:22.223 --> 16:24.396
as quickly as he can get those
kids to kick up their heels?

16:24.959 --> 16:27.701
(SIGHS) Okay,
I'll file a motion.

16:27.762 --> 16:29.639
Look, we're all
in agreement here.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.108
This is a crime.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.402
I sure hope so.

16:36.904 --> 16:40.408
People v. Rodriguez. The defendant was
compelled to undergo an AIDS blood test.

16:40.474 --> 16:42.977
The People are not asking
a suspect to take a test.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.523
They're asking us to release the
test results on a third party.

16:45.579 --> 16:47.024
The issues of privacy
are the same.

16:47.348 --> 16:50.192
In Rodriguez, the defendant was
charged with sexual assault.

16:50.251 --> 16:52.697
The victim moved to determine
her attacker's HIV status

16:52.753 --> 16:54.528
for her own peace of mind.

16:54.588 --> 16:56.727
Ms. Ross seeks to turn
Rodriguez on its head.

16:56.791 --> 16:58.498
Your Honor, if we don't get
this man off the street,

16:58.559 --> 16:59.765
he will infect more women,

16:59.827 --> 17:02.137
and we can't get him off the
street if we don't know who he is.

17:02.196 --> 17:04.335
VESSAS: There's a larger
consideration here, Judge.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.207
The need for secrecy
to encourage those people

17:06.267 --> 17:08.178
who may be infected
to get tested,

17:08.234 --> 17:10.771
and for those people who are
infected to seek treatment.

17:10.838 --> 17:13.579
If the D.A. can force disclosure,
people infected with HIV

17:13.641 --> 17:15.814
are going to avoid the city Health
Department like the plague.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.614
Ms. Ross, if I order
these records unsealed,

17:19.680 --> 17:21.682
won't I send the AIDS
community a message

17:21.749 --> 17:23.922
that confidentiality is
out the window?

17:23.983 --> 17:26.021
The People's need for
this information is limited.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.997
We're not asking for
all records to be unsealed.

17:28.055 --> 17:30.001
Only one order
about one individual.

17:30.057 --> 17:34.437
Which is how it starts. If
one, why not two, 10,100?

17:34.495 --> 17:37.374
Rodriguez presented unprecedented
issues in this state.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.502
In that case, the suspect
had already been arrested.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.774
In this case, we're breaking
confidentiality to make an arrest.

17:42.837 --> 17:44.282
We're in uncharted waters here.

17:44.338 --> 17:45.544
Is there a crime here?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.347
That's what we're
trying to determine.

17:47.408 --> 17:49.081
That's why we need
to talk to him.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.360
Given both the seriousness
of the consequences

17:55.416 --> 17:57.020
and the urgency of the matter,

17:57.084 --> 17:59.496
I'm inclined to lean a little on
the side of protecting the health,

17:59.553 --> 18:02.090
and perhaps the life of those
who are in danger of infection

18:02.156 --> 18:05.160
over a right that is not
a matter of life and death.

18:05.226 --> 18:07.502
You've got your records
unsealed, Counselor.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.905
We're looking for
a kid named Twist.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.535
Last known address,
your building.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.704
Didn't give an apartment.

18:13.768 --> 18:17.807
Stark. That's it. Kenny Stark,
in what's-his-name's place.

18:17.872 --> 18:18.976
A real pain in the ass.

18:19.039 --> 18:20.074
Which apartment?

18:20.708 --> 18:23.416
I haven't seen him since,
what month is this?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.888
He moved out, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

18:24.945 --> 18:26.390
We need to find him, fast.

18:27.381 --> 18:30.658
Well, you know Village Blues, two blocks up?
You can't miss it.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.356
He used to work in the kitchen.

18:32.419 --> 18:33.420
Thanks.

18:37.057 --> 18:39.833
Yeah, he washed dishes
whenever he needs the cash.

18:41.629 --> 18:43.734
I haven't seen him for awhile.

18:43.797 --> 18:44.867
Romeo, right?

18:46.066 --> 18:49.309
Different girl every
time he comes in. Young.

18:49.737 --> 18:50.943
You know the type.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.281
Gets the girls by
playing the doomed artist.

18:54.441 --> 18:55.977
And they're so dumb.

18:56.043 --> 18:58.683
They see him shooting smack,
and want to take care of him.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.657
CURTIS: He do
a lot of drugs?

19:00.714 --> 19:03.251
Not really his thing. Just
enough to convince himself

19:03.317 --> 19:04.523
that he's not middle class,

19:04.585 --> 19:07.498
and convince the girls
that he's a tortured soul.

19:08.088 --> 19:09.863
You know where he lives?
Around.

19:09.924 --> 19:12.268
Anybody who's stupid
enough to take him in.

19:12.326 --> 19:14.397
Like that kid he was
with the other night.

19:14.461 --> 19:17.032
She was putting up those
flyers about that lost cat.

19:20.301 --> 19:22.178
What, the Siamese?
Manx.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.376
Got it.

19:26.740 --> 19:28.720
Are you here about my cat?

19:28.776 --> 19:30.949
Actually we're looking
for Kenny Stark.

19:32.246 --> 19:33.816
Twist.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.618
What for?
Is he in trouble?

19:36.183 --> 19:37.560
Is he staying with you?

19:38.986 --> 19:40.021
What's he done?

19:40.087 --> 19:41.464
CURTIS: Is he here?

19:41.522 --> 19:42.933
He just went out.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.128
BRISCOE: Where'd he go?

19:44.625 --> 19:48.402
He's in this band. They've
got this big gig coming up.

19:48.462 --> 19:49.532
I mean, it's not definite,

19:49.597 --> 19:51.406
but this A&R guy's gonna
come down and check them out,

19:51.465 --> 19:53.775
and they're going to get
this big recording contract.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.006
You should hear them.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.742
Well, maybe we can
go hear them rehearse.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.143
Hey, it's nothing
for you to worry about.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.246
(SIGHS) East Third, 413.
Over the laundromat.

20:06.146 --> 20:07.147
You his girl?

20:08.749 --> 20:10.251
Yeah.

20:10.551 --> 20:12.588
Did Kenny tell you he was sick?

20:14.421 --> 20:15.422
What do you mean?

20:16.891 --> 20:20.304
Listen, don't go anyplace. We're
gonna have to talk to you, okay?

20:24.999 --> 20:27.070
We're looking for Twist.

20:27.134 --> 20:29.876
Hey, it's okay. I got this
problem with my eyes.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.712
See, I can't see
anything but Twist.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.683
I can't even see you.
Where is he?

20:41.715 --> 20:43.092
(GLASS CLANKING)

20:44.385 --> 20:45.728
STARK: Hey, no, baby,

20:45.786 --> 20:48.130
I don't use rubbers.
It's better bareback.

20:48.188 --> 20:49.428
CURTIS: Police!
STARK: What's going on?

20:49.490 --> 20:51.367
CURTIS: Get out of bed. Let's go.
How the hell?

20:51.425 --> 20:52.460
Stand up.

20:52.526 --> 20:54.665
Kenny Stark, you're under arrest
for the murder of Grace Leonard,

20:54.728 --> 20:56.867
and the attempted
murder of Lana Madison.

20:56.931 --> 20:58.808
WOMAN: Twist. You've got the
right to remain silent.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.870
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

21:04.038 --> 21:07.679
"Docket number 27341.
People v. Kenneth Stark."

21:08.075 --> 21:09.748
One count Murder
in the Second Degree.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.290
Four counts Attempted Murder
in the Second Degree.

21:12.346 --> 21:13.848
Mr. Stark,
how do you plead?

21:13.914 --> 21:15.291
Not guilty, Your Honor.

21:15.349 --> 21:16.692
The People request remand.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.457
Mr. Stark is
not a flight risk.

21:18.519 --> 21:21.159
He's a threat to the community.
Mr. Stark is HIV positive...

21:21.221 --> 21:24.395
So, we put everyone with
AIDS in internment camps?

21:24.458 --> 21:25.903
Not everyone with AIDS,
Your Honor.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.769
Just those who
deliberately infect others.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.705
MARGINI: From the beginning
of the AIDS crisis,

21:29.763 --> 21:32.903
quarantine has been consistently
rejected as an option.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.577
"The power given by statute
to isolate a person"

21:35.636 --> 21:38.515
"is dependent upon his infections
or contagious disease."

21:38.572 --> 21:39.676
Smith v. Emery.

21:39.740 --> 21:45.554
1896. And, Your Honor, the most
recent applicable law is from 1947.

21:45.612 --> 21:47.216
We're talking ancient history.

21:47.281 --> 21:49.659
Is Mr. Margini suggesting
the court ignore precedent?

21:49.717 --> 21:53.824
Is Ms. Ross suggesting the court
ignore basic Constitutional rights?

21:53.887 --> 21:57.266
Mr. Stark has no Constitutional
right to place others at risk.

21:57.324 --> 21:59.770
All right, Counselors,
settle down.

21:59.827 --> 22:01.738
Defendant is
remanded to custody.

22:03.097 --> 22:04.940
Think you're a little hasty?

22:04.999 --> 22:06.637
We have a serial
killer on the streets.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.941
I'm not sure prudence
dictates we go slow.

22:09.003 --> 22:10.778
We're not talking
about a serial killer.

22:10.838 --> 22:14.615
All right, a serial killer can murder
what, two, three, half a dozen?

22:14.675 --> 22:17.679
Stark can infect,
kill dozens, hundreds.

22:17.745 --> 22:19.190
What he did is clearly a crime.

22:19.246 --> 22:21.317
In a perfect world.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.988
But in this one, under the
system of laws that we have...

22:24.051 --> 22:27.589
Just before he was being arrested, the
police heard Stark say to a girl,

22:27.654 --> 22:29.133
"It's better bareback."

22:30.290 --> 22:31.394
What?

22:31.458 --> 22:33.301
ROSS: He didn't want
to use a condom.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.430
Brother.

22:34.495 --> 22:37.738
JACK: And he told one girl he wanted
to infect as many women as he could.

22:37.798 --> 22:39.004
It's a crime, Adam.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.841
Is it one we want to prosecute?

22:41.301 --> 22:44.077
A lot of people are gonna
see this as a signal

22:44.138 --> 22:46.744
for open season
on people with AIDS.

22:47.174 --> 22:49.279
That's a political
consideration, Adam.

22:49.343 --> 22:52.415
Political. Just possibly
Constitutional.

22:52.479 --> 22:56.518
People are dying. We have the
tools to stop it. Let's use them.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.256
No one gave consent
to get infected.

22:58.318 --> 23:00.889
The Health Department
traces these things.

23:00.954 --> 23:02.797
This is their responsibility.

23:02.856 --> 23:06.360
Sure, to trace them,
not to stop them.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.634
The Health Department
is not the sex police.

23:09.196 --> 23:11.176
Besides, these kids
don't even report it.

23:12.299 --> 23:13.835
And you think that this case...

23:13.901 --> 23:15.403
Could save
some lives? Sure.

23:15.469 --> 23:17.415
Well, we're not here
to start a crusade.

23:17.471 --> 23:19.781
And I'm not on a crusade.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.287
We can't save everyone from
getting shot on the street,

23:23.343 --> 23:25.823
and I know we can't save
everyone who gets AIDS.

23:25.879 --> 23:27.984
It is our job to
prosecute anyone

23:28.048 --> 23:29.652
who's responsible for
the death of another.

23:29.716 --> 23:32.162
Playing into the
worst kinds of prejudice.

23:32.219 --> 23:34.199
It'll be on the front
page of every newspaper.

23:34.254 --> 23:35.995
I don't want that.

23:36.857 --> 23:39.701
Get Stark to plead out.
Do what you have to.

Anne Paulsen. Kagan,
Romero, Schoenholtz.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.843
I'll be handling Mr. Stark's
case from here on in.

23:51.905 --> 23:53.145
Where's Mr. Margini?

23:53.207 --> 23:54.652
He went back to
defending streetwalkers.

23:55.943 --> 23:57.820
JACK: Your client's
easily amused?

23:57.878 --> 24:00.017
That's not half as
funny as the charges.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.718
What's your interest
in this case?

24:01.782 --> 24:05.161
Her weekly golf game with my mother
who lives next door in Ardsley.

24:05.219 --> 24:06.391
And a very large retainer.

24:06.453 --> 24:07.454
Kenny.

24:07.521 --> 24:09.194
I didn't notice them
at the arraignment.

24:09.256 --> 24:10.564
They're suddenly concerned?

24:10.624 --> 24:12.399
Yeah, well, we haven't seen
much of each other lately.

24:12.459 --> 24:14.200
Mr. Stark's been out of
contact with his family

24:14.261 --> 24:15.433
the past couple of years.

24:16.096 --> 24:17.803
His murder spree
took all his time.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.135
(SCOFFS)

24:19.199 --> 24:22.510
Look, do you want to
tell me what happened?

24:22.936 --> 24:24.609
I can assure you, Mr. McCoy,

24:24.705 --> 24:27.686
his parents will do everything
they can to help their boy.

24:27.741 --> 24:29.550
We're ready to offer man one.

24:29.977 --> 24:32.014
Three-to-nine, and
he names his contacts.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.218
So you can manufacture
more fake charges?

24:34.515 --> 24:36.552
So we can alert
your client's victims.

24:37.217 --> 24:40.255
Victims? We all know
the charges are bogus.

24:40.320 --> 24:44.200
His irresponsibility is sad and
immoral, but it isn't a crime.

24:44.258 --> 24:46.135
I'm moving to dismiss.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.009
PAULSEN: Mr. McCoy is seeking
to criminalize sexual activity.

24:55.068 --> 24:58.106
No, I'm seeking to impose
criminal sanctions on a murderer.

24:58.171 --> 25:01.641
No matter how irresponsible he may
be, Mr. Stark is not a murderer.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.086
His weapon of choice
may be unusual,

25:04.144 --> 25:07.216
but he's no less deadly than a
common thief who fires a gun.

25:07.281 --> 25:10.194
You can infer intent when
a thief pulls a trigger.

25:10.250 --> 25:13.959
Mr. Stark told one of his victims
he wanted to take them with him.

25:14.021 --> 25:16.934
Your Honor, if you allow Mr. McCoy
to prosecute people with AIDS...

25:16.990 --> 25:20.494
He knowingly infected others
with a deadly disease.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.370
No warning, no protection.

25:22.429 --> 25:23.806
Enough.

25:23.864 --> 25:27.505
It's a sustainable case, Mr. McCoy,
if you can prove intent.

25:27.835 --> 25:29.405
I'm going to let you proceed,

25:30.003 --> 25:32.711
but I'm mindful of the
sensitivity of this issue.

25:32.773 --> 25:35.720
I won't let you turn
this into a witch hunt.

25:38.045 --> 25:39.615
If you go forward
with this case,

25:39.680 --> 25:41.626
you are crucifying
an entire community!

25:41.682 --> 25:45.323
We're not crucifying a community,
we're prosecuting one man.

25:45.385 --> 25:46.921
Who has AIDS!

25:46.987 --> 25:49.365
And who therefore, in the
press, in the public mind...

25:49.423 --> 25:51.061
Nobody has said he's gay.

25:51.124 --> 25:52.831
You think that's going
to make a difference?

25:52.893 --> 25:55.669
You know, people hear
AIDS, they think gays.

25:55.729 --> 26:00.144
The tabloids will use this case to attack
anyone who's HIV positive, which...

26:00.200 --> 26:01.907
Which includes...
Yes.

26:01.969 --> 26:04.882
You've got to think about the
effect that this is going to have!

26:04.972 --> 26:06.815
Therefore, don't
prosecute a murderer

26:06.873 --> 26:11.117
who happens to be a Christian
fundamentalist because people might think

26:11.178 --> 26:13.454
he represents all
Christian fundamentalists.

26:13.513 --> 26:14.548
That it?

26:14.614 --> 26:18.357
The courts don't exist in some
sort of ivory tower, Adam.

26:18.418 --> 26:20.364
All legal decisions
are political.

26:20.420 --> 26:23.594
I don't make decisions about
which cases to prosecute

26:23.657 --> 26:26.661
based on fear of what
the newspapers will say.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.705
I've always
supported you, Adam.

26:29.763 --> 26:32.744
Every time you've come up for
reelection, I've busted my hump for you

26:32.799 --> 26:35.803
and I have never asked
for anything in return.

26:36.503 --> 26:38.847
But if you don't
back off on this one,

26:39.606 --> 26:41.017
I will bury you.

26:41.675 --> 26:43.177
Start digging...

26:48.982 --> 26:51.622
So Judge Al Hoyt
found for the People.

26:52.052 --> 26:53.895
When'd he grow a backbone?

26:53.954 --> 26:55.661
Maybe he has granddaughters.

26:55.722 --> 26:58.896
He's what they used to
call a confirmed bachelor.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.103
Well, you got your crime.

27:01.395 --> 27:03.807
Do you think Paulsen
will consider a plea?

27:03.864 --> 27:06.504
We tried again.
She turned us down.

27:06.566 --> 27:08.273
Establish intent.

27:08.702 --> 27:12.013
Maybe then her
client will wise up.

27:12.806 --> 27:14.444
Establish intent.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.380
This thing's
political poison for him.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.385
Background noise.
Ignore it.

27:22.082 --> 27:24.824
Let's start with the victims.
Lana Madison?

27:24.885 --> 27:26.831
We have her sworn statement.
The girl in the loft?

27:26.887 --> 27:27.957
She's on board.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.661
Stark's girlfriend,
Leslie Crowell?

27:31.124 --> 27:32.364
I'll talk to her.

27:35.495 --> 27:37.975
Those girls you
said he infected?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.271
Twist isn't that kind of guy.

27:39.332 --> 27:41.107
I mean, I know him.
You don't.

27:41.168 --> 27:42.306
I know what he did.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.280
You know what they said he did.

27:44.337 --> 27:45.611
What do you know about them?

27:45.672 --> 27:47.151
One's dead from AIDS.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.345
Another's infected.

27:48.575 --> 27:49.747
I don't have AIDS.

27:49.810 --> 27:50.948
You been checked out?

27:51.011 --> 27:52.547
My blood's okay.

27:53.113 --> 27:54.251
What clinic?

27:56.783 --> 28:00.026
Leslie, this is important. You
have to get a test. Please.

28:00.087 --> 28:01.498
What do you care?

28:01.555 --> 28:05.093
I'll take you. Sometimes it's
easier if someone goes with you.

28:07.194 --> 28:09.834
I went to see Twist.
In the Tombs.

28:12.332 --> 28:14.778
My mom kicked me out of the
house after my dad died.

28:15.369 --> 28:20.682
When I met Twist, he told me he'd
been waiting for me all his life.

28:22.042 --> 28:26.320
My mom, my dad, they never
even told me they loved me.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.620
Leslie, how long
have you known him?

28:29.783 --> 28:31.160
Two months.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.332
How do you know those girls
didn't get it from someone else

28:35.388 --> 28:37.994
or needles and
blame it on Twist?

28:38.058 --> 28:41.699
Because, like that girl in Central
Park who was screaming at him?

28:42.095 --> 28:43.199
About what?

28:43.263 --> 28:45.869
When she saw him with his arm
around me, she went crazy,

28:45.932 --> 28:47.036
saying she was
going to get him.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.545
She was going to make him pay.

28:48.735 --> 28:49.839
Because?

28:49.903 --> 28:51.439
Because she was jealous.

28:52.506 --> 28:54.110
Maybe it was because
he gave her AIDS.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.254
Well, she didn't
say anything about that.

28:57.310 --> 29:01.383
She just said she was gonna make him pay.
And she did, didn't she?

29:02.382 --> 29:03.622
You know her name?

29:03.683 --> 29:07.062
She has light brown
hair, she's 5'5 ", 5'6."

29:10.223 --> 29:11.395
ROSS: How long
have you been sick?

29:11.458 --> 29:14.337
It's just a cold.
It's no big deal.

29:14.394 --> 29:15.771
I don't need
anybody's sympathy.

29:15.829 --> 29:18.435
I've got enough trouble
dealing with my parents.

29:18.498 --> 29:20.774
You sure Kenny Stark
gave you HIV?

29:20.834 --> 29:22.336
You can prove it?
Yes.

29:22.435 --> 29:24.472
Details? Partners?
Dates?

29:24.538 --> 29:26.779
This is gonna be embarrassing.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.751
What about meeting him
in the park?

29:28.809 --> 29:30.345
Who told you about that?

29:30.410 --> 29:31.445
Is there a reason to hide it?

29:31.511 --> 29:33.422
No. No. It's just...

29:33.480 --> 29:34.857
Why didn't you tell the police?

29:34.915 --> 29:36.451
Because it would
sound like I accused him

29:36.516 --> 29:38.621
of giving me AIDS
to get back at him.

29:38.752 --> 29:39.787
And did you?

29:39.853 --> 29:41.662
Twist gave me the disease.

29:41.955 --> 29:46.335
(CRYING) Then he laughed. Yeah,
yeah, I want to get back at him.

29:46.393 --> 29:50.205
I'm never gonna get
married or have kids.

29:50.997 --> 29:55.241
I mean, what's the point of staying
in school or going to college?

30:01.708 --> 30:05.713
Even if we don't put Lana on the
stand, Paulsen will. Thank you.

30:05.812 --> 30:07.883
Then she'll put
Leslie on the stand.

30:07.948 --> 30:09.825
Why did she threaten Stark?

30:09.883 --> 30:12.420
Why didn't she tell anyone
about meeting him in the park?

30:12.486 --> 30:14.261
Who else could she
have gotten HIV from?

30:14.321 --> 30:17.495
Reasonable doubt.
I've got reasonable doubt.

30:17.557 --> 30:19.230
Doubt the kid is
telling the truth?

30:19.292 --> 30:22.000
Doubt that a jury will ever
buy it, even if she is.

30:22.062 --> 30:23.939
We don't put Lana on the stand,

30:23.997 --> 30:27.604
the jury doesn't hear Stark's threat.
We lose half our case.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.613
We may lose the other half.

30:29.970 --> 30:32.541
A motion to suppress
Stark's test results.

30:32.606 --> 30:36.247
We can't prove he knew he had
AIDS, we can't prove intent.

30:40.780 --> 30:42.259
PAULSEN: It's black-letter
law, Your Honor.

30:42.315 --> 30:45.057
The doctor-patient
relationship is sacrosanct.

30:45.118 --> 30:46.825
Your Honor, Judge Kaplan
has already ruled

30:46.886 --> 30:48.194
that the records can
be unsealed.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.230
I don't care what
Barbara Kaplan ruled.

30:50.290 --> 30:51.291
Go on, Ms. Paulsen.

30:51.358 --> 30:55.932
Not only is that confidentiality
supported by CPL 3504,

30:55.996 --> 30:58.806
the city's own Health Department
rules specifically state

30:58.865 --> 31:01.709
the identity of AIDS patients
must remain anonymous.

31:01.768 --> 31:05.511
Your Honor, this report is the
only record we could possibly have

31:05.572 --> 31:08.644
of one of the elements of
the crime, namely, intent.

31:08.708 --> 31:10.415
The court must
put aside the fact

31:10.477 --> 31:12.821
that it takes the form
of a medical report.

31:12.879 --> 31:16.827
Well, how does this differ from any
other medical communication, Mr. McCoy?

31:16.883 --> 31:18.954
People v. Thomas,
People v. Fonseca,

31:19.019 --> 31:21.329
People v. Gearhardt,
in all those cases,

31:21.388 --> 31:25.359
the courts ruled that the State's right
to learn if a defendant had AIDS

31:25.458 --> 31:26.766
outweighed his
right to privacy.

31:26.826 --> 31:29.238
PAULSEN: Which is a basic
Constitutional right.

31:29.296 --> 31:31.708
In those cases,
the crime was never in doubt.

31:31.765 --> 31:36.145
In this case, you're trashing the
principles this country was founded on.

31:36.236 --> 31:38.716
Judge, you open this door,
where does it end?

31:38.772 --> 31:41.878
Even the Gay Men's Health Crisis
group has reversed its position,

31:41.942 --> 31:45.151
and come out in favor of doctors
reporting HIV positives

31:45.211 --> 31:46.485
to the State Health Department.

31:46.546 --> 31:49.356
I don't care
what that group does.

31:49.416 --> 31:53.728
The Constitutional issue is not
to be lightly swept aside.

31:53.787 --> 31:57.462
The rules of confidentiality
should not have been breached.

31:57.524 --> 32:00.971
Therefore, the report on Mr. Stark's
condition is suppressed.

32:01.027 --> 32:03.007
PAULSEN: Your Honor,
I am moving to dismiss.

32:03.063 --> 32:05.737
Without evidence of intent, the
charges can't be sustained.

32:05.832 --> 32:08.540
We still have Lana Madison's
statement about Mr. Stark's threat.

32:08.601 --> 32:11.081
That's hearsay from a witness
who could have contracted AIDS

32:11.137 --> 32:12.946
from any number
of sexual partners.

32:13.006 --> 32:15.452
We have her
entire sexual history.

32:15.508 --> 32:17.488
Unless she's forgotten someone,

32:17.544 --> 32:19.490
or is protecting someone,
or lied.

32:19.546 --> 32:22.390
Quite right, Ms. Paulsen. I'm
granting your motion to dismiss,

32:22.449 --> 32:24.053
but I'm staying the order

32:24.117 --> 32:26.825
until what I assume
will be Mr. McCoy's

32:26.886 --> 32:28.923
speedy appeal to
the appellate court.

32:29.256 --> 32:32.465
Now, you've got 48 hours to put
something together, Mr. McCoy.

32:32.525 --> 32:33.731
(GAVEL POUNDS)

32:35.996 --> 32:39.910
McCoy, you're a nice
guy, so I've been nice.

32:39.966 --> 32:43.072
Drop this case, or I'm going
to roast you in the papers.

32:43.136 --> 32:45.377
How's Adam Schiff
going to take to that?

32:49.743 --> 32:51.279
So, it went that well, huh?

32:51.344 --> 32:52.482
Yep.

32:52.545 --> 32:56.357
Forty-eight hours to prove Stark
knew he had AIDS a year ago.

32:56.416 --> 32:59.420
To prove intent all over again.
Make the case from scratch.

32:59.486 --> 33:00.863
Forget it.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.026
Let the 48 hours expire.
Blame it on the judge.

33:04.090 --> 33:05.865
Is it the idea of trying
to protect people

33:05.925 --> 33:08.235
from the consequences of
casual sex that offends you?

33:08.294 --> 33:10.774
Oh, I see.
I'm an old fuddy-duddy.

33:10.830 --> 33:13.902
No, Adam, I just...
And I think it's politics,

33:13.967 --> 33:17.244
and I'm afraid the case
will sink the election?

33:17.304 --> 33:19.511
If we had a chance, I'd
tell you to go ahead,

33:19.572 --> 33:21.051
whatever happens.

33:21.107 --> 33:23.314
But we're past that now.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.719
Cut your losses.

33:26.579 --> 33:29.287
I want to talk to his parents first.
Then we'll see.

33:29.349 --> 33:31.056
Then we'll see.

33:34.988 --> 33:37.400
We went to visit
Kenneth in jail.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.866
He still won't talk to us.

33:41.528 --> 33:45.340
My son hasn't really been part
of the family since he was 16.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.740
Before jail, when was the
last time you spoke to him?

33:49.803 --> 33:52.647
Last spring. When
did he come up here?

33:52.705 --> 33:53.979
Uh...

33:55.475 --> 33:58.046
April.
The dogwood was out.

33:59.512 --> 34:00.786
Didn't even call first.

34:03.216 --> 34:05.890
Last spring. That's around the
time he found out he had AIDS.

34:05.952 --> 34:08.899
Did he say anything to
you about his health?

34:10.989 --> 34:13.732
He came to you because
he was sick, didn't he?

34:14.127 --> 34:15.333
(CLEARS THROAT)

34:23.303 --> 34:25.476
Mr. and Mrs. Stark,
you do understand

34:25.538 --> 34:28.382
that this isn't just
about your son's welfare.

34:28.475 --> 34:30.716
But it is my son
you're asking about.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.313
ROSS: Your son consciously
infected other people.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.382
Just how many, we don't know.

34:35.482 --> 34:37.518
We're aware of what
you're accusing him of.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.427
He has to be stopped.

34:41.087 --> 34:42.327
He should be off the streets.

34:42.388 --> 34:45.062
Don't you think we've been
trying for the last few years?

34:45.123 --> 34:47.627
If he came to you, if he told
you about his condition...

34:47.694 --> 34:49.935
You could use that
to put him in jail.

34:49.996 --> 34:51.668
We've offered to make a deal.

34:51.731 --> 34:53.904
Isn't this something you should
be talking to my lawyer,

34:53.967 --> 34:55.139
my son's lawyer about?

34:55.400 --> 34:58.405
We're willing to reduce the charges
from murder to manslaughter.

34:58.471 --> 35:02.977
Instead of going to jail for 25
years-to-life, he goes for three-to-nine.

35:04.377 --> 35:06.687
Our son may be
dead in three years.

35:06.746 --> 35:09.852
Even if Kenny did come
to us when he was sick,

35:10.650 --> 35:13.153
do you think we would
help you put him in jail?

35:13.219 --> 35:18.567
My son has had problems, I know
that, and he's going to die.

35:19.292 --> 35:21.932
So will a lot of other children,
if you don't help us.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.030
You don't know that.

35:23.096 --> 35:26.703
And you will be just as responsible
for their deaths as he is.

35:26.766 --> 35:29.474
I'm going to live
after my son is gone.

35:30.203 --> 35:32.911
I can't live knowing
he died hating me.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.010
He'll die with us, at home.

35:39.145 --> 35:40.556
Not in jail.

35:42.615 --> 35:45.027
I checked with the Starks'
insurance company.

35:45.085 --> 35:47.895
Mid-April, around the time he
showed up at his parents' house,

35:47.987 --> 35:51.901
Mrs. Stark called the company to see if their
son was still covered under their plan.

35:51.958 --> 35:53.528
There was a note in the file.

35:53.593 --> 35:56.597
So, the kid comes home, tells
his parents he's sick.

35:56.663 --> 36:00.577
The HMO told Mrs. Stark that she
could put her son on the policy

36:00.633 --> 36:02.670
by paying a premium
after he's had a physical.

36:02.735 --> 36:06.478
Which Kenny can't take because
it'll show he's HIV positive.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.220
The parents knew a year ago.

36:09.275 --> 36:11.152
But won't cooperate with us.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.884
Because they still
want to protect him.

36:12.946 --> 36:16.359
Not enough to dig into their own
pockets, get him treatment.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.461
I checked their bank accounts,
stock transactions.

36:19.519 --> 36:22.830
There were substantial withdrawals,
cash, at regular intervals.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.267
His parents were slipping
him money to get help.

36:25.325 --> 36:26.531
We don't know that.

36:26.593 --> 36:29.506
But Stark and his lawyer
don't know we don't.

36:29.696 --> 36:32.108
We can fold or bluff.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.011
We talked to your parents.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.880
We know they
contacted their HMO

36:39.939 --> 36:41.282
to try to get
you on their plan.

36:41.341 --> 36:43.651
Privileged. No jury
will ever hear that.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.747
They made
regular cash withdrawals.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.985
And you can't prove they've
been giving it to my client.

36:48.047 --> 36:50.323
We know you used the money
to get medical help.

36:50.383 --> 36:53.387
Funny thing about cash, McCoy.
It all looks the same.

36:53.453 --> 36:55.558
JACK: You want me to charge
his parents with obstruction?

36:55.622 --> 36:56.930
PAULSEN: What are you
going to charge me with?

36:56.990 --> 36:58.970
Accessory after the fact?
(LAUGHS)

36:59.025 --> 37:00.060
You're dreaming, McCoy.

37:00.126 --> 37:02.128
None of this will fly
with the appellate court.

37:02.195 --> 37:04.175
I'll file again next
year and the year after.

37:04.230 --> 37:05.971
We'll wheel him in on a gurney.

37:06.232 --> 37:08.769
See what the jury
thinks about that.

37:11.070 --> 37:12.208
Conference is over.

37:16.075 --> 37:17.486
(SIGHS)

37:17.810 --> 37:20.654
We've got till the end of
the day to file the appeal.

37:22.382 --> 37:24.885
Maybe I'll have lunch first.
It's Friday.

37:25.418 --> 37:27.728
We might get more
time by being late.

37:35.028 --> 37:36.939
Mr. McCoy. Ms. Ross.

37:38.097 --> 37:41.135
My clerk told me why
you're here. Forget it.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.180
Your Honor, if this
Stark kid gets out,

37:43.236 --> 37:45.409
it's like releasing
Theodore Kaczynski

37:45.471 --> 37:47.781
and giving him
a bomb and a stamp.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.649
I can understand your concern.

37:49.709 --> 37:52.383
But an expedited
appeal with a full panel?

37:52.445 --> 37:54.118
It's 4:00, Friday.

37:54.447 --> 37:55.482
This is urgent.

37:55.548 --> 37:57.824
You know the chances of
finding four of my brethren

37:57.884 --> 37:59.420
to take the bench at this hour?

37:59.485 --> 38:02.625
Judge Hoyt's
stay expires today.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.031
Stark will be out
by tomorrow morning.

38:06.092 --> 38:08.094
You want me to extend
the stay until Monday?

38:08.161 --> 38:11.631
Unless you can find a full
panel now to hear my appeal.

38:13.132 --> 38:16.670
Enjoy your weekend. I think you're
going to have a rough Monday.

38:18.071 --> 38:20.312
Two more days.
What's the next move?

38:20.373 --> 38:23.752
Prove Stark knew he had AIDS.
Stark's girlfriend.

38:24.477 --> 38:27.481
Maybe he told her something
about what he had.

38:29.382 --> 38:32.386
He'd never do anything to hurt anybody.
I know that.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.991
But I don't know.

38:35.955 --> 38:39.493
From where I sit, he doesn't
seem to care about anyone.

38:39.592 --> 38:40.662
Not even you.

38:40.727 --> 38:41.762
That's not true.

38:41.828 --> 38:44.138
I mean, he told me
I had to be protected.

38:44.731 --> 38:46.574
What did he tell you?

38:46.632 --> 38:50.603
He said it wasn't about not
getting pregnant, it was about...

38:51.104 --> 38:52.515
That he was sick.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.477
Did he tell you
he was HIV positive?

38:57.443 --> 39:00.947
He said he was sick, and he
didn't want me to get sick.

39:01.714 --> 39:05.719
I mean, he knew we had to use a
condom, but I didn't want him to.

39:06.586 --> 39:09.192
If he was sick,
whatever it was,

39:09.255 --> 39:10.734
well, it's like
we were married.

39:10.790 --> 39:12.792
"Till death do us part."

39:17.897 --> 39:21.208
He knew he had AIDS. We can
argue intent from that.

39:21.267 --> 39:22.678
Not on our Murder Two.

39:22.735 --> 39:26.114
On the woman he was about to
infect when he was arrested.

39:26.172 --> 39:27.674
Attempted murder.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.083
Based on what
the cops overheard?

39:29.142 --> 39:30.416
Mmm-hmm.

39:30.476 --> 39:34.481
New evidence, new charge. We're
gonna give these judges a headache.

39:34.547 --> 39:36.584
There's a cure for headaches.

39:36.649 --> 39:37.753
Poor Leslie.

39:38.351 --> 39:41.298
She thought she was helping him by
telling us how considerate Stark was.

39:41.354 --> 39:43.994
The only decent thing he ever
did is going to sink him.

39:47.894 --> 39:49.805
I understand
the People have dismissed

39:49.862 --> 39:51.273
the top count
of the indictment,

39:51.330 --> 39:52.968
Murder in the Second Degree?

39:53.032 --> 39:54.511
Yes, we're proceeding
with the charge

39:54.567 --> 39:56.444
of Attempted Murder
in the Second Degree.

39:56.869 --> 39:58.143
All right.

39:58.204 --> 40:02.448
This is a complicated case, and
I'll review the circumstances.

40:02.508 --> 40:04.886
We're well briefed
on the facts.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.849
Isn't this really a
question of whether or not

40:07.914 --> 40:11.885
you can establish the defendant's
intent as a matter of law?

40:12.919 --> 40:15.195
JACK: Yes, Your Honor.
And the People believe we can.

40:15.922 --> 40:17.230
HOW?

40:17.290 --> 40:21.102
JACK: Mr. Stark told his current
girlfriend that he was sick,

40:21.160 --> 40:23.800
and needed to use a condom
for her protection.

40:23.930 --> 40:26.308
And from that you infer intent?

40:26.799 --> 40:30.144
JACK: After he made that statement,
he was arrested in the process

40:30.203 --> 40:33.047
of initiating the sexual
act with another party.

40:33.239 --> 40:35.344
And you know
what he was thinking?

40:35.408 --> 40:39.857
The police overheard him say to this
partner that he did not use condoms.

40:40.446 --> 40:42.551
What were his exact words?

40:45.151 --> 40:49.622
"Hey, no, baby, I don't use rubbers.
It's better bareback."

40:50.389 --> 40:54.531
Your Honor, intention can
be inferred from the act.

40:54.594 --> 40:56.335
People v. Stokes.

40:56.395 --> 41:00.400
And this inference is
to be drawn by the jury.

41:00.867 --> 41:02.938
If the defendant gets
back on the street,

41:03.002 --> 41:07.109
in the course of his lifetime, a
lifetime which may be tragically short

41:07.173 --> 41:11.815
or indefinitely long, how many
other women might he infect?

41:12.178 --> 41:14.317
Two dozen? 50? 100?

41:16.315 --> 41:18.955
Yes, this is a difficult case.

41:19.018 --> 41:23.057
And, yes, it challenges the
court to balance two goods.

41:24.123 --> 41:26.296
The right to privacy,

41:26.359 --> 41:28.532
and the right of people
in the most intimate act

41:28.594 --> 41:31.131
to trust that they will be safe.
The right to life.

41:31.998 --> 41:33.306
I am not going to pass judgment

41:33.366 --> 41:36.870
on whether or not the women who had
intimate relations with Mr. Stark

41:36.936 --> 41:40.679
should have avoided them. I'm
not going to blame the victim.

41:42.842 --> 41:45.345
But having decided,
for whatever reason,

41:45.411 --> 41:48.255
to enter a liaison
with Mr. Stark,

41:48.314 --> 41:51.761
those women deserve the
protection that they would have

41:51.818 --> 41:55.561
if Mr. Stark brought to bed with
him a knife or a razor or a gun.

41:57.290 --> 42:01.932
Mr. Stark brought to bed with him
something equally dangerous.

42:02.962 --> 42:05.806
If the law can't protect those
women, then we've all failed,

42:05.865 --> 42:09.244
and that's a failure that
I'm not willing to concede.

42:11.504 --> 42:14.576
All I want is the chance
to get before a jury.

42:28.721 --> 42:31.930
ABRAM: As Mr. McCoy said,
this case is a difficult one.

42:33.025 --> 42:34.402
Difficult, first of all,

42:34.460 --> 42:38.169
because it will affect people's
attitudes and behavior.

42:38.231 --> 42:40.677
Some consequences
we can predict.

42:40.733 --> 42:41.871
Others we can't.

42:42.802 --> 42:44.509
People may use what we say here

42:44.570 --> 42:47.414
to support the
rankest kind of bias.

42:47.974 --> 42:49.783
They may use
what we say to excuse

42:49.842 --> 42:52.220
the most licentious
kind of conduct.

42:53.546 --> 42:55.048
It is difficult, second of all,

42:55.114 --> 42:58.823
because the issues before us
couldn't be more serious,

42:59.151 --> 43:02.132
touching on the very
Constitutional principles

43:02.188 --> 43:03.826
that framed our country.

43:03.890 --> 43:07.360
However, this difficulty does not
absolve us from passing judgment.

43:07.426 --> 43:09.906
In fact,
because it is difficult,

43:09.962 --> 43:12.169
we must pass judgment
with prudence

43:12.231 --> 43:15.735
so that we neither
follow nor lead society.

43:16.869 --> 43:20.078
And though the case is a complex
one, our job is simple.

43:20.139 --> 43:23.450
To apply the law,
fairly and reasonably.

43:24.610 --> 43:27.716
Weighing the rights of the
individual versus the common good,

43:27.780 --> 43:30.420
we were obliged
to rule in a way

43:30.483 --> 43:34.625
that protects the benefit of the
many over the interest of the few.

43:35.254 --> 43:39.168
The People have met their burden.
The order below is set aside.

43:46.966 --> 43:49.674
Congratulations.
You got your reversal.

43:51.837 --> 43:55.546
I'll feel better when your client's out
of circulation for the rest of his life.

43:55.608 --> 43:57.884
I don't know how
long that's going to be.

43:57.944 --> 44:02.051
Mr. Stark was admitted to the hospital
last night with a temperature of 103.

44:02.114 --> 44:04.492
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

44:05.651 --> 44:06.755
(SIGHS)

44:06.952 --> 44:08.226
What's your offer?

44:09.055 --> 44:11.296
Same as before.
Three-to-nine.

44:12.491 --> 44:14.630
We'll support any effort
to get him into Bedford.

44:14.994 --> 44:16.701
They have good
medical facilities there.

44:16.762 --> 44:18.036
(SIGHS)

44:18.097 --> 44:20.577
All right.
You got a deal.

44:26.639 --> 44:29.051
I talked to Stark's parents.
Kenny's in bad shape.

44:29.108 --> 44:31.110
He's got a week, maybe two.

44:31.177 --> 44:32.212
Lana Madison?

44:32.278 --> 44:34.724
So far, so good.
Leslie tested negative.

44:36.916 --> 44:38.691
You're really keeping track.

44:38.751 --> 44:40.128
Yeah.

44:40.586 --> 44:42.259
On this one, yeah.
