WEBVTT

00:39.289 --> 00:39.956
{\an3}PATRICIA?

00:40.039 --> 00:42.000
{\an1}DON'T COME ANY CLOSER OR
I'LL SCREAM.

00:42.083 --> 00:46.087
{\an1}YOUR FRIEND HAS DISAPPEARED,
HASN'T SHE? JOY MERCER?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.464
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

00:47.547 --> 00:51.468
{\an5}BECAUSE I'M A PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR. MY NAME
IS RENE ZELDMAN.

00:51.551 --> 00:55.472
IF YOU GET ME A PHOTOGRAPH
OF HER THEN I CAN HELP YOU.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.140
HOW?

00:57.223 --> 01:01.227
{\an4}I THINK THAT SHE IS IN GREAT
DANGER BUT I KNOW THAT WE CAN
FIND HER.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.897
WE?

01:08.401 --> 01:13.698
{\an1}NOW, IF YOU WANT TO HELP
JOY, THEN YOU WILL CALL ME.

01:21.039 --> 01:25.293
{\an4}"WHEN DAYTIME ENDS AT
MIDDAY, THROUGH TEARS OF
GLASS THE EYE SHALL SEE."

01:25.376 --> 01:25.794
IS THAT ON THE
SHAKESPEARE TEST?

01:25.877 --> 01:27.837
NO!! IT'S THE CLUE.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.507
OH RIGHT. I DON'T GET
IT THOUGH, DO YOU?

01:30.590 --> 01:33.843
{\an5}BY THE WAY, DO YOU GUYS
KNOW WHAT IS ON THAT
SHAKESPEARE TEST?

01:33.927 --> 01:39.015
{\an4}"WHEN DAYTIME ENDS AT
MIDDAY, THROUGH TEARS OF
GLASS THE EYE SHALL SEE".

01:39.098 --> 01:40.183
YEP. STILL DON'T
GET IT.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.769
{\an1}WE NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT.
SO, LUNCHTIME YEAH?

01:42.852 --> 01:43.853
(together)
SIBUNA.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.854
SIBUNA.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.689
WHY CAN'T THERE BE LIKE
A MAP OR SOMETHING?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.983
{\an5}THAT'S WHAT YOU USUALLY
GET WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR TREASURE.

01:49.067 --> 01:49.692
<i>WHAT TREASURE?</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:51.194
OH, NOTHING.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.988
{\an4}JUST SOME LITTLE KIDS'
PIRATES THING ON THE BACK OF
A CEREAL BOX.

01:54.072 --> 01:58.535
{\an1}I'M LIKE REALLY INTO...PIRATES.
LIKE, SO MUCH.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.494
RIGHT.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.371
HI AMBER

02:01.454 --> 02:02.539
HI BOO.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.707

02:04.791 --> 02:08.044
AW THAT'S LOVELY.
THANK-YOU!

02:08.127 --> 02:11.673
{\an1}AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
LIKE, HANG OUT THIS LUNCHTIME.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.508
{\an1}SEEING AS YOU SNEAKED OFF
WITHOUT ME YESTERDAY.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.386
ER. YEAH, THING IS. . .

02:16.469 --> 02:19.305
THAT MIGHT BE
A PROBLEM.

02:19.389 --> 02:25.019
FINE. WHATEVER. I KNOW
WHEN I'M NOT WANTED.

02:26.855 --> 02:30.525
WHAT'S HE SO
CRANKY ABOUT?

02:32.151 --> 02:33.862
{\an1}BABES, WHY ARE YOU
IN SUCH A MOOD?

02:33.945 --> 02:35.572
MAYBE BECAUSE I DON'T
LIKE BEING IGNORED.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.700
{\an1}I DON'T MICK. YOU'RE PRETTY
HARD TO IGNORE.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.077
WELL MAKE TIME FOR
ME AMBS YEAH?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.621
STARTING THIS
LUNCHTIME?

02:43.705 --> 02:46.207
WHAT ELSE IS THERE
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.834
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:47.917 --> 02:52.046
{\an1}WELL THEN? YOU AND ME. WE'LL
GO FOR A - I DUNNO...

02:52.130 --> 02:53.715
{\an1}A PICNIC? I
LOVE PICNICS.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.634
A PICNIC. YEAH, OKAY.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.931
{\an1}POOR, ALFIE. OPERATION AMBER
IS DEFINITELY NO PICNIC.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.351
{\an1}<i>OKAY, SETTLE DOWN, EVERYONE</i>
<i>PLEASE.</i>

03:05.435 --> 03:10.106
{\an4}RIGHT, LET'S TALK
PROSPECTIVE PARENTS
DAY SHALL WE?

03:10.189 --> 03:13.109
SEEING AS THERE'S BEEN SUCH
A POOR SHOW OF VOLUNTEERS,

03:13.192 --> 03:16.237
{\an1}I'VE DECIDED TO ALLOCATE YOU
YOUR TASKS MYSELF.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.822
{\an4}I THINK YOU'LL ALL FIND I'VE
CATERED TO YOUR ACADEMIC
STRENGTHS.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.825
THAT'S MICK DOING
NOTHING THEN!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.745
(everybody laughs)

03:24.829 --> 03:25.955
{\an1}DO YOU THINK MR WINKLER CHOSE
ME TO HOSTESS THE PARENTS

03:26.039 --> 03:27.832
{\an1}BECAUSE I'M THE BEST LOOKING
GIRL IN SCHOOL,

03:27.916 --> 03:30.835
OR WAS IT MY BUBBLY
PERSONALITY,

03:30.919 --> 03:32.462
OR WAS IT MY SHOES?

03:32.545 --> 03:33.338
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.798
AW. SWEET. AND TRUE.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.344
{\an1}HEY GUYS. WAIT UP! CATCH YOU
LATER THEN BOO.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.099
MICK HATES ME.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.392
NO HE DOESN'T.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.937
{\an4}HE HASN'T SAID A WORD TO ME
SINCE THAT STUFF WITH THE
FRENCH TEST.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.813
WELL HE'LL COME AROUND.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.982
SORRY MARA, I NEED TO
SPEAK TO JASON.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.108
MR WINKLER!

03:54.192 --> 03:56.402
DID YOU HEAR BACK FROM
THE PHOTOGRAPHER?

03:56.486 --> 03:59.906
AND?

04:01.532 --> 04:02.158
{\an3}I KNEW IT!!

04:02.241 --> 04:04.118
SO NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.079
YOU ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.206
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MR
SWEET IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME

04:08.289 --> 04:10.083
{\an1}AND I INTEND TO CONFRONT
HIM WITH THE EVIDENCE.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.502
FINALLY! I'M GOING TO GET
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.545
THANK-YOU SO MUCH.

04:15.463 --> 04:21.135
{\an5}WHAT DO YOU THINK,
STRAWBERRY PASSION, OR
BASHFUL CINNAMON?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.596
YEAH, EITHER LOOKS CUTE.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.849
OKAY, SO, MIDDAY IS
TWELVE O'CLOCK.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.478
{\an5}UNLESS IT'S A CRYPTIC
REFERENCE, BUT LET'S GO
WITH THAT FOR NOW.

04:30.561 --> 04:34.274
"WHEN DAYTIME ENDS".
APOCALYPSE?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.442
NO, THAT'S THE END OF THE
WORLD. NOT THE END OF DAY.

04:36.526 --> 04:40.613
{\an1}THINK. WHERE DOES THE SUN GO
DOWN AT MIDDAY? EVER?

04:40.697 --> 04:43.116
SCANDINAVIA?

04:43.199 --> 04:45.618
{\an1}NO. THEY HAVE MIDDAY DAWNS,
BUT NOT MIDDAY SUNSETS.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.539
I KNOW! IN CARTOONS?

04:50.832 --> 04:54.752
WHAT ABOUT THIS? PARTIAL
ECLIPSE - MIDDAY SUNSET.

04:54.836 --> 04:55.920
YOU'VE GOT IT!

04:56.004 --> 04:56.713
GOT WHAT?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.589
{\an4}LOOKS, BRAINS, CHARM . YOU
KNOW,

04:58.673 --> 05:00.299
{\an4}ALL THOSE THINGS YOU
DON'T HAVE JEROME.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.802
{\an1}YOUR GIRLFRIEND WAS MISSING
YOU, RUTTER.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.387
(Silly voice) HELLOOOO

05:02.885 --> 05:04.387
{\an3}HA HA HA.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.141
"KISS ME"! "KISS ME
DARLING!"

05:08.224 --> 05:09.475
ER, ALFIE?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.894
OH.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.897
{\an5}WELL, AS STIMULATING AS
YOUR NON-CONVERSATION
MAY BE TO EACH OTHER,

05:14.981 --> 05:16.024
{\an1}IT'S A LITTLE BIT DULL FOR
THE LIKES OF US.

05:16.107 --> 05:21.070
{\an1}SO WE'RE GOING TO GO KICK UP
A STORM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.742
(Knock knock knock)

05:27.660 --> 05:30.955
COME.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.292
{\an1}AH, JASON. PLEASE,
TAKE A SEAT.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.587
{\an1}YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.
YOU SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.922
IT IS.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.717
{\an5}I SPOKE TO DAPHNE THE
OTHER DAY ABOUT
PATRICIA WILLIAMSON.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.761
OH YES.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.889
{\an1}SHE MANAGED TO ALMOST CONVINCE
ME THAT PATRICIA WAS,

05:47.972 --> 05:52.101
{\an5}SHALL WE SAY,
"OVER-IMAGINATIVE"
TO BE POLITE?

05:52.185 --> 05:56.272
{\an1}THE THING IS, SHE ALMOST
CONVINCED ME. BUT, NOT QUITE.

05:56.355 --> 06:05.281
{\an1}NOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
ERIC , WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:09.994 --> 06:14.874
IT'S BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW.

06:15.291 --> 06:21.464
{\an1}OH DEAR. YOU NEED TO
SPEAK TO VICTOR.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.675
VICTOR?

06:26.052 --> 06:32.391
{\an4}THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THERE
WERE 242 SOLAR ECLIPSES
BETWEEN 1801 AND 1900,

06:32.475 --> 06:35.853
BUT WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
BETWEEN 1901 AND 1923.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.730
WHY NOT ASK SARAH?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.733
{\an5}YOU'VE SEEN FOR YOURSELF,
AMBER, SHE'S NOT EXACTLY
PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.444
DUH. NOT SARAH.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.320
{\an1}(Little girl voice)
SARAH.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.323
{\an1}YOU NEVER KNOW. SHE MIGHT
MENTION SOMETHING?

06:47.406 --> 06:49.117
{\an1}NOT JUST BEAUTY AND
SOPHISTICATION.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.037
{\an1}I'VE GOT SMARTS TOO.
TONS OF THEM.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.935
WHAT ARE THOSE SQUIGGLES?
IT'S LIKE A HEART MACHINE.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.563
{\an1}THIS IS THE SOUND TRANSLATED
AS A PICTURE.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.064
SO THIS BIT IS
REALLY LOUD.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.607
{\an1}THESE BITS ARE ALL REALLY
QUIET

07:21.691 --> 07:25.570
{\an1}AND THIS MUSIC SOFTWARE IS
CLEARING ALL THE INTERFERENCE.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.614
OKAY. SO WHERE DO WE START?

07:29.198 --> 07:31.117
THE BEGINNING.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.037
{\an4}<i>(recording of Sarah)</i>
<i>"SOMETIMES HE SAYS THINGS IN</i>
<i>THE HOPE THAT I'LL REACT,</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:36.706
<i>"BUT I DON'T.</i>

07:36.789 --> 07:40.084
{\an4}<i>"INSTEAD, I THINK OF MOTHER AND</i>

ONE MASSIVE SURPRISE."

07:44.964 --> 07:46.716
WHAT'S THAT?

07:46.799 --> 07:50.386
{\an4}<i>"THE LADY OF THE HOUSE LOCKED</i>
<i>AWAY, WAS A TOTAL NUT JOB'ETH.</i>
<i>HA HA HA."</i>

07:50.469 --> 07:51.429
ALFIE AND JEROME!

07:51.512 --> 07:52.555
{\an1}WELL THIS EXPLAINS THEIR
HASTY EXIT EARLIER.

07:52.638 --> 07:57.310
{\an1}OKAY, IF THEY'VE HEARD THIS,
THEY MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING.

07:57.393 --> 08:02.607
{\an1}THEN AGAIN, THIS IS ALFIE AND
JEROME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.450
(to himself)
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.743
OH DEAR.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.663
HEY! THESE ARE THE COSTUMES
FOR PROSPECTIVE PARENTS DAY!

08:17.747 --> 08:18.915
HA HA HA! SUCK IT UP ALFIE.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.334
WHAT IS THIS?

08:21.417 --> 08:25.421
{\an4}YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS, BECAUSE
JASON ASKED ME TO PERFORM,
INSTEAD OF YOU.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.299
{\an5}OH YEAH, A BUNCH OF
BORING PARENTS WITH NO
TASTE WHATSOEVER

08:28.382 --> 08:29.425
{\an1}IS REALLY MY IDEA OF A
GREAT AUDIENCE.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.886
THAT IS FOR GOING
THROUGH MY STUFF.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.054
{\an1}AND THAT IS FOR RECORDING
OVER MY FILES!

08:34.138 --> 08:35.932
OW! WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.099
JUST FOR FUN.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.477
{\an1}SO, HOW MUCH DID YOU HEAR?
OR UNDERSTAND?

08:39.559 --> 08:42.104
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW, WE
ONLY HEARD THAT ONE BIT.

08:42.188 --> 08:46.859
{\an4}AND YOU, BY THE WAY, HAVE
SOME REALLY WEIRD TASTE IN
RECORDED BOOKS, MILLINGTON.

08:47.526 --> 08:50.279
HI BOO! I'M...

08:50.363 --> 08:52.615
{\an1}I'M SO SORRY,
SOMETHING CAME UP

08:52.698 --> 08:58.746
{\an1}WE'RE DONE, AMBER. AND I HATE
IT WHEN YOU CALL ME BOO.

08:58.829 --> 08:59.163
DID HE JUST DUMP ME?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.707
YOU BET HE DID.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.750
NINA, WHAT DO I DO?

09:02.833 --> 09:06.921
{\an1}GO AFTER HIM! I THINK...NOT
MY GREATEST AREA.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.130
WHAT'S THE POINT?

09:08.214 --> 09:08.965
{\an1}HE ALREADY MADE HIS FEELINGS
PRETTY CLEAR.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.635
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.887
{\an1}HOW DID IT GO WITH MR SWEET?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

09:14.971 --> 09:15.805
DID YOU GET ANY ANSWERS?

09:15.888 --> 09:17.974
MR WINKLER.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.726
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

09:20.810 --> 09:25.273
NO, BUT I'M GOING TO
GET SOME NOW.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.156
{\an4}<i>(recording of Sarah) "MOTHER</i>
<i>AND FATHER HAVE GIVEN THE</i>
<i>HOUSE A NAME. ANUBIS.</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:37.660
<i>"I THINK IT'S EGYPTIAN.</i>

09:37.743 --> 09:38.619
{\an1}<i>"THEY'RE GOING AWAY AGAIN</i>
<i>SOON.</i>

09:38.703 --> 09:42.164
{\an1}<i>"TO EGYPT I THINK. FATHER</i>
<i>SAYS HE HAS TO"</i>

09:42.248 --> 09:48.671
IT'S JUST. I LOVE HIM,
NINA. I REALLY LOVE HIM.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.507
AND I'VE MESSED IT ALL UP,

09:51.591 --> 09:54.510
AND NOW I'M MESSING
UP THE RECORDING.

09:54.593 --> 09:58.514
IT'S OKAY. IT DOESN'T
MATTER ABOUT ALL THAT.

09:58.597 --> 10:02.226
IT'LL BE FINE. IT'S OKAY.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.939
THAT'S PRETTY. WHAT IS IT?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.608
A SUNSET.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.945
"WHEN DAYTIME ENDS".

10:13.029 --> 10:16.115
A SUNSET. "AT MIDDAY".

10:16.198 --> 10:18.159
THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENS.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.871
YES! YOU ARE BRILLIANT!

10:34.175 --> 10:36.093
WELL?

10:36.177 --> 10:37.553
{\an3}MR WINKLER?

10:37.636 --> 10:38.763
JASON? WHAT DID HE SAY?

10:38.846 --> 10:45.644
{\an4}QUITE THE LITTLE
TROUBLEMAKER AREN'T
YOU PATRICIA?

10:54.403 --> 10:58.240
{\an1}AND WHEN HE CAME OUT OF HIS
OFFICE HE'D GONE ALL STRANGE.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.203
MORNING EVERYONE.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.288
{\an1}WELL...? WHAT DID VICTOR
SAY?

11:04.372 --> 11:07.249
THERE'S NO BIG MYSTERY
I'M AFRAID, PATRICIA.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.293
JOY'S GONE HOME,
LIKE THEY SAID.

11:09.377 --> 11:13.005
{\an4}OKAY, AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL
AWARE, IT'S PROSPECTIVE
PARENTS DAY.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.967
IS EVERYONE CLEAR ON THEIR
INDIVIDUAL TASKS?

11:19.011 --> 11:24.517
(Alfie is beatboxing)

11:27.019 --> 11:29.605
THIS IS YOUR BIG CHANCE TO
WIN AMBER'S HEART, DUDE.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.816
SHE'S BEEN DUMPED, SHE'S
VULNERABLE.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.861
{\an5}SHE NEEDS A SENSITIVE GUY
LIKE YOU WITH A BIG SHINY
SHOULDER TO CRY ON.

11:35.945 --> 11:40.116
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. JASON SAID
I CAN'T GET THE COSTUME WET.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.160
{\an5}IF YOU WANT TO WIN THE
GIRL'S HEART, YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW MY FOUR STEP PLAN.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.788
STEP 1: ATTENTION.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.957
MAKE SURE SHE NOTICES YOU.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.542
STEP 2: INTENTION.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.878
{\an4}SHOW HER YOU'RE INTERESTED
BECAUSE WOMEN WANT TO BE
SWEPT OF THEIR FEET.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.964
BE NOTICED AND SWEEP
HER OFF HER FEET.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.049
STEP 3: LONGING.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.300
I'VE ALREADY GOT THAT
ONE COVERED.

11:58.384 --> 12:03.055
{\an1}NO! SHE HAS TO LONG FOR YOU.
YOU HAVE TO BE HER HERO.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.390
HERO?

12:04.473 --> 12:09.728
{\an1}LOOK. TRY TO BE MORE OF AN
IRON MAN THAN A TIN MAN.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.031
PATRICIA.

12:21.115 --> 12:24.994
MRS ANDREWS.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.347
NO, NO, YOU'LL HAVE TO USE
THE OTHER ONE.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.892
THAT DOOR'S BEEN STUCK FOR AS
LONG AS ANYONE CAN REMEMBER.

12:47.975 --> 12:51.103
{\an1}VICTOR TRIED TO GET IT OPEN,
BUT IT JUST WON'T BUDGE.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.022
THAT'S ODD.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.191
IT IS, I KNOW. MUST BE
A DESIGN FAULT.

12:55.274 --> 13:00.362
{\an5}SHAME REALLY, WITH MICK'S
APPETITE, I COULD DO WITH
AN EXTRA OVEN!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.740
{\an1}WHAT WAS THE HOUSE LIKE BACK
THEN TRUDY?

13:02.823 --> 13:06.285
{\an5}I SUSPECT THIS HOUSE WAS
VERY MUCH THE SAME AS IT
IS NOW.

13:06.368 --> 13:10.080
DO YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'VE
GOT SOME PHOTOS SOMEWHERE.

13:10.164 --> 13:15.377
I KNOW THAT THE HALLWAY WAS
MUCH GRANDER THAN IT IS NOW.

13:15.461 --> 13:21.300
NOW THEN. AH HERE WE ARE.

13:21.383 --> 13:27.014
{\an1}I THINK WE'VE STILL GOT THAT
CHANDELIER SOMEWHERE.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.017
(Whispers) TEARS OF GLASS.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.399
YOU KNOW THAT GHOST I KEPT
SEEING? HE EXISTS.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.945
HE'S A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

13:41.028 --> 13:45.074

VERY GOOD IDEA SIR. WE ERM.

14:09.306 --> 14:12.059

VERY GREAT HEIGHT.

14:12.142 --> 14:19.149

YOURSELF THAT, JEROME.

14:37.585 --> 14:41.255

CHICKS ROUND HERE TAKE US
SERIOUSLY, DUDE?

14:41.338 --> 14:44.758

PLAN ALFIE. HEROICS.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.011
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BECOME A
HERO ALFIE?

14:49.054 --> 14:52.266
A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.143

14:55.144 --> 14:57.229
HEY.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.480
HI.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.608

IF YOU LIKE.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.820

FORGIVEN ME?

15:06.905 --> 15:07.865
MICK.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.783
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK,
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

15:09.867 --> 15:15.706
NO. RIGHT. SORRY.
OK....LIPS SEALED.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.339
{\an1}WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
WHO WE TRUST.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.760
{\an5}I'M WITH YOU ON THAT. THE
NEW TEACHER, HE WAS ON MY
SIDE.

15:27.843 --> 15:31.096
THEN HE GOT CLOSE TO THE
TRUTH AND HE'S CHANGED.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.016
HE'S... HE'S ONE OF
THEM NOW.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.018
{\an1}PATRICIA, HE HAS BEEN
CONVERTED.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.896
{\an4}I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR JOY'S
SAFETY.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.940
{\an1}DO YOU HAVE THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS
I ASKED YOU FOR?

15:42.024 --> 15:46.695
{\an5}NO. I'VE GOT SOME ON MY
COMPUTER. I'LL SEND
THEM TO YOU.

15:46.779 --> 15:52.117
{\an5}LISTEN, IF I'M TO TRUST
YOU, IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU'RE HONEST WITH ME.

15:52.201 --> 15:56.705
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

15:56.789 --> 16:01.627
{\an4}MY REAL NAME IS RUFUS ZENO,
BUT YOU MUSN'T TELL ANYONE
YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.713
{\an1}IT COULD PUT JOY'S LIFE IN
SERIOUS DANGER.

16:04.797 --> 16:10.260
GOOD. NOW I WANT YOU TO HAVE
A LOOK AT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.

16:10.344 --> 16:14.056
{\an5}HAVE YOU COME ACROSS
ANYTHING THAT LOOKS
LIKE THESE?

16:16.433 --> 16:18.602
THIS LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.896
{\an1}WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO
DO WITH JOY?

16:20.979 --> 16:23.315
THAT IS THE EYE
OF HORUS.

16:23.399 --> 16:28.654
{\an4}AND IT MAY GIVE US SOME
CLUES AS TO SOLVING JOY'S
DISAPPEARANCE.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.993
{\an4}WHY HAVE YOU TWO SUDDENLY
BECOME INTERESTED IN HOME
RESTORATION?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.203
IT'S ABOUT HERITAGE, TRUDY.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.623
THIS IS PART OF THE HOUSE'S
HISTORY AND WE RESPECT THAT.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.958
THIS IS ALL SO NEW TO ME.

16:41.041 --> 16:45.295
{\an1}WE DON'T GROW HOUSES LIKE
THIS IN AMERICA.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.590
{\an1}CAN YOU SMELL SOMETHING...?
OH NO THE CAKES!

16:48.674 --> 16:53.512
{\an4}OKAY, I SAY ONE OF US STAYS

UP TO THE ATTIC.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.849
