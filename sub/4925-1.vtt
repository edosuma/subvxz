03:23.092 --> 03:24.127
""Amazing Grace. ""

03:24.732 --> 03:25.721
Excuse me?

03:25.932 --> 03:27.331
My grandmother sang that song to me.

03:28.132 --> 03:29.611
That's real nice.

03:29.812 --> 03:31.882
l especially like the part that goes:

03:32.132 --> 03:34.692
""l once was lost, but now l'm found. ""

03:34.892 --> 03:38.931
Take you, for instance. You must be
a fool to roll up in here, man.

03:39.132 --> 03:41.407
But l figure you must be lost.

03:41.652 --> 03:45.440
So l tell you what. See this here?
This is for your bill.

03:45.892 --> 03:46.881
And. . .

03:47.092 --> 03:50.721
. . .since you look like
such a jovial individual. . .

03:50.932 --> 03:51.887
. . .here's the tip.

04:21.372 --> 04:22.771
""Find"" your ass out of here.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.325
We haven't finished our drinks.

04:25.812 --> 04:26.801
You finished now?

04:27.052 --> 04:28.610
Let it go, Po.

04:29.172 --> 04:30.810
This is a hassle we don't need.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.803
And don't come back, zipperhead.

04:44.372 --> 04:46.363
Po, get them out of here!

04:48.452 --> 04:49.646
Now.

04:58.452 --> 04:59.487
Let's go.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.609
Guess you want to gamble
with your life.

05:01.812 --> 05:03.325
Casino's as good a place as any.

05:08.292 --> 05:10.647
Guess l could use a little exercise.

06:14.772 --> 06:16.888
Guns don't kill people.

06:17.452 --> 06:18.567
People kill people.

06:19.652 --> 06:22.769
For example,
these two guys with the machine guns.

06:22.972 --> 06:24.769
lf they start blasting off. . .

06:25.052 --> 06:27.168
. . .ain't none of y'all going home!

06:27.772 --> 06:32.163
You guys are disturbing my business.
So if your ass ain't black. . .

06:32.372 --> 06:35.569
. . .you'd better get up out of here
before it really get hot!

06:56.452 --> 06:57.646
Let's go.

06:58.332 --> 06:59.401
Ladies, excuse us.

06:59.692 --> 07:01.489
-What are you doing, Kai?
-Get them out.

07:01.732 --> 07:03.450
-You too.
-No. Stay.

07:03.812 --> 07:04.961
You too, please.

07:05.172 --> 07:07.163
What were you doing?
We're in a damn war.

07:07.372 --> 07:08.930
l'm a big boy now.

07:09.172 --> 07:11.083
These black guys'll bury you.

07:11.292 --> 07:12.566
You work for me, Kai.

07:12.772 --> 07:13.841
l work for your father.

07:14.052 --> 07:16.043
Get your head out of your ass, Po.

07:16.292 --> 07:19.489
As long as there's a war going on,
you're my responsibility.

07:19.812 --> 07:21.803
l can take care of myself.

08:16.732 --> 08:18.450
Oh, my God.

09:25.892 --> 09:28.281
Tiger, you killing me, man.
l hate this game.

09:28.492 --> 09:29.447
lsaak!

09:30.172 --> 09:31.651
You have a phone call.

09:31.932 --> 09:33.365
l'll take it in the house.

09:34.372 --> 09:35.600
l need a break anyway.

09:35.812 --> 09:38.246
l don't even know why
you stressing it, man.

09:39.092 --> 09:42.084
You know why l'm stressing.
All future business deals. . .

09:42.292 --> 09:46.649
. . .will take place not in the pool
hall, but in somebody's country club.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.205
You know that.

09:48.612 --> 09:50.603
lf you're serious
about going straight. . .

09:50.812 --> 09:53.372
. . .l want to know if you got a plan
for old Mac.

09:53.692 --> 09:56.968
Or should l start looking at the
classifieds?

09:58.052 --> 09:59.724
As long as l'm breathing. . .

09:59.932 --> 10:03.004
. . .you ain't ever got to worry about
no classifieds.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.607
Come on, boy.

10:06.812 --> 10:08.370
You know it's me and you.

10:12.252 --> 10:14.163
Hey, what you got for me?

10:16.972 --> 10:17.961
You sure about that?

10:18.212 --> 10:19.247
What's wrong?

10:23.972 --> 10:25.371
What's wrong, man?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.725
Somebody canceled Ch'u's boy.

10:29.252 --> 10:33.484
You set up a meeting with Ch'u ASAP,
then find out who killed his boy.

10:33.972 --> 10:36.566
Don't even sweat it, okay?
l got it.

16:18.092 --> 16:19.286
Mr. O'Day.

16:19.772 --> 16:21.285
Mr. Sing's at gate B-1 2.

16:21.492 --> 16:22.686
Thank you.

16:37.852 --> 16:39.808
Nice touch on the metal detectors.

16:40.052 --> 16:42.566
Keeps everybody honest, my man.

16:50.132 --> 16:52.407
You have my deepest condolences.

16:52.652 --> 16:53.971
Thank you.

16:55.412 --> 16:57.448
What happened to your son
was tragic.

16:58.812 --> 16:59.722
Very unnecessary.

17:00.892 --> 17:03.770
l want you to know l'll be
looking into this personally.

17:04.172 --> 17:07.368
You will forgive me
if l'm not easily moved.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.011
Mr. Sing. . .

17:11.612 --> 17:14.046
. . .with all due respect,
there is no way. . .

17:14.291 --> 17:16.931
. . .anybody in my camp would touch
your family. . .

17:17.172 --> 17:20.528
. . .any more than anybody in your camp
would touch mine.

17:20.732 --> 17:22.085
lt just wouldn't happen.

17:25.492 --> 17:28.882
Our business venture will continue.

17:29.812 --> 17:31.245
l'm pleased to hear that.

17:54.012 --> 17:57.163
Make sure we got 24-hour security
for my son and daughter.

17:57.372 --> 18:00.125
lt's all been arranged, chief.

18:03.492 --> 18:05.483
Make those lemon tarts for the kids.

18:06.572 --> 18:09.166
l need to get a signature from you.

18:09.932 --> 18:10.728
Thanks.

18:10.932 --> 18:12.650
-You're welcome.
-Excuse me.

18:12.852 --> 18:15.491
-Do you have this in a small?
-One minute. Amy.

18:15.732 --> 18:17.802
Help her out for me.
She'll help you.

18:19.332 --> 18:23.007
-What are y'all doing?
-You got a little something-something?

18:23.412 --> 18:25.687
Girl, tell him to turn up the music.

18:29.332 --> 18:31.129
Show them how we used to do it.

18:41.252 --> 18:43.322
Watch the store for me, okay?

18:47.412 --> 18:48.845
Oh, shit.

18:52.452 --> 18:55.012
What a name for a store:
Serpentine Fire.

18:55.732 --> 18:58.200
That's tight. lt's real tight.

18:58.612 --> 19:00.364
Kool and the Gang jam
from back in the day.

19:00.612 --> 19:02.284
Earth, Wind and Fire.

19:02.812 --> 19:04.370
That serious shit.

19:04.892 --> 19:05.802
Do l know you?

19:07.252 --> 19:08.970
How you gonna play me like that?

19:09.212 --> 19:10.361
l work for your pops.

19:10.612 --> 19:13.331
-Right. Your name starts with an ""M. ""
-That's it.

19:13.692 --> 19:14.727
Moron.

19:15.972 --> 19:18.042
Funny. lt's Maurice, all right?

19:18.812 --> 19:22.327
Maurice, l'd love to reminisce
with you, but l'm busy right now. . .

19:22.572 --> 19:24.369
. . .so let's do this later, okay?

19:24.572 --> 19:26.881
-lt don't work like that.
-Excuse me?

19:27.092 --> 19:29.287
Your father could be
catching some static. . .

19:29.492 --> 19:31.483
. . .and Mac wants me
to watch your back.

19:31.732 --> 19:32.721
l'll tell you something.

19:32.932 --> 19:37.164
Whatever my father and Mac are into
has nothing to do with me.

19:37.412 --> 19:40.210
You can hate them all you want.
That's your business.

19:40.452 --> 19:43.967
lf they say not to let you out of
my sight, you can go to confession. . .

19:44.172 --> 19:47.403
. . .and it's going to be you,
me and the priest.

19:47.692 --> 19:48.602
That's ridiculous.

19:48.852 --> 19:50.888
Look. My ride's right over there.

19:51.332 --> 19:54.608
Back seat or the trunk.
Make it easy on yourself.

19:54.812 --> 19:56.450
Your choice, baby girl.

19:57.292 --> 19:58.361
Waiting for the magic word.

19:59.572 --> 20:00.641
Please?

20:06.012 --> 20:07.001
Stuck-up.

20:07.212 --> 20:09.203
l got some coloring books
in the back.

20:09.452 --> 20:12.125
-You think you're funny.
-l'm babysitting.

20:12.332 --> 20:14.288
l gotta bring something
for the kids.

20:15.452 --> 20:17.761
Can l get my leg in the car? Damn!

20:17.972 --> 20:18.848
Damn!

20:36.052 --> 20:37.804
<i>The NFL announced Friday</i>
<i>that Oakland...</i>

20:38.012 --> 20:40.606
<i>... will become home</i>
<i>to its newest expansion team.</i>

20:40.812 --> 20:44.009
<i>The question of who the new owners</i>
<i>will be is still unresolved.</i>

20:44.212 --> 20:46.248
<i>For more we go to Jody Vance.</i>

20:46.452 --> 20:47.646
<i>That's right, Perry.</i>

20:47.852 --> 20:51.367
<i>Several groups of investors will be</i>
<i>presenting proposals this week.</i>

20:51.772 --> 20:56.084
l thought we were done with football
when the Raiders left town.

20:56.332 --> 20:58.687
-Yeah, well, jobs.
-What?

20:58.932 --> 21:01.605
Jobs. See, if they have to build
another stadium. . .

21:01.812 --> 21:04.724
. . .some of us that have been less
fortunate can attain jobs.

21:04.932 --> 21:09.130
Harold, your unfortunate ass been
sitting in that chair for 1 5 years.

21:09.332 --> 21:12.290
You couldn't attain a job if one
bit you in the butt.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.726
You think you're funny.

21:15.212 --> 21:16.725
Got a package for you.

21:17.492 --> 21:19.881
l'm laughing because
you think you're funny.

21:20.452 --> 21:21.601
Thanks.

21:21.852 --> 21:25.003
You want a job, Harold?
Open this damn box.

21:25.252 --> 21:26.685
Well, lookie, lookie.

21:26.932 --> 21:28.001
Who sent you a present?

21:28.212 --> 21:29.804
l don't know.
Probably your wife.

21:30.012 --> 21:31.240
There you go again.

21:56.772 --> 21:57.887
Thank you.

22:11.652 --> 22:12.880
-Excuse me.
-Off duty.

22:13.092 --> 22:14.207
Can you take me here?

22:14.412 --> 22:16.448
Can't you understand English?

22:16.692 --> 22:18.091
Two words: off duty.

22:40.012 --> 22:41.001
How you doing?

22:43.892 --> 22:45.371
How you doing?!

22:47.932 --> 22:49.331
This shit tight, huh?

22:49.572 --> 22:52.564
This shit's tight.
Girl, what's your name?

22:53.572 --> 22:55.244
l said, what's your name?!

22:56.572 --> 22:59.405
What? You don't like a big man?
You not knowing.

23:01.892 --> 23:03.962
-What's up, Alonso?
-Trish, what's up?

23:04.172 --> 23:07.005
-Just chilling. Getting some albums.
-That's it today?

23:08.372 --> 23:11.045
-You want this on your tab?
-Yeah, please.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.285
Thank you.

23:18.652 --> 23:20.165
This is my shit!

23:23.212 --> 23:24.327
Shit!

23:24.532 --> 23:28.730
This is my shit right here!
l got something for you right now.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.965
My bad.

23:35.732 --> 23:36.721
Shit!

23:45.212 --> 23:47.407
Thank goodness. Just drive.

23:47.972 --> 23:49.121
Two words: off duty.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.001
You know what?

23:53.092 --> 23:54.207
Jesus.

23:54.412 --> 23:56.687
Two words for you, buddy:
on duty, 50 bucks.

23:58.412 --> 24:01.370
l'm gonna find you!
l know where you work at!

24:03.452 --> 24:06.285
Please, just do me a favor
and get me out of here.

24:08.052 --> 24:09.041
Who's that?

24:09.532 --> 24:10.931
Nobody.

24:23.692 --> 24:25.410
Where did you learn to drive?

24:26.732 --> 24:27.528
Ahkbar?

24:28.012 --> 24:29.001
Hong Kong.

24:35.452 --> 24:37.170
You gonna start the meter?

24:47.732 --> 24:49.131
Stole a lot of cabs
in Hong Kong?

24:49.612 --> 24:50.727
Want me to pull over?

24:50.932 --> 24:54.129
No, no. Just turn here.

24:57.092 --> 25:00.687
So, Ahkbar, tell me. ls it true what
they say about Hong Kong?

25:01.132 --> 25:02.565
What's that?

25:02.772 --> 25:04.046
All you guys do kung fu.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.367
Of course.

25:05.612 --> 25:06.601
State law.

25:07.052 --> 25:09.441
Can you break a board with your head?

25:09.692 --> 25:10.807
Sure.

25:11.172 --> 25:14.448
That l'd have to see.
You must be a very dangerous man.

25:15.052 --> 25:16.041
Are you scared?

25:17.892 --> 25:19.723
Don't take this personal. . .

25:19.932 --> 25:22.127
. . .but l've been around more
dangerous guys than you.

25:22.692 --> 25:23.886
Right here's fine.

25:29.572 --> 25:30.561
No charge.

25:30.812 --> 25:32.484
Keep it. l won't call the cops.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.131
l don't want your money.

25:37.892 --> 25:39.564
You seem like a nice guy.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.568
l am.

25:40.972 --> 25:44.567
You should find a new profession.
Stealing cars doesn't fit you.

25:46.172 --> 25:47.048
What's your name?

25:47.252 --> 25:48.571
You think l want you calling me?

25:48.772 --> 25:49.807
l don't have a phone.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.968
Yeah? Well, dead giveaway.

25:52.692 --> 25:54.284
Besides, you drive like shit.

26:20.692 --> 26:22.648
How are those acquisitions
coming along?

26:22.852 --> 26:24.763
Progressing real nice, man.

26:24.972 --> 26:28.203
l just have three more deeds
to get signed over.

26:28.452 --> 26:31.364
Let me be clear.
You don't play around with the NFL.

26:31.612 --> 26:35.207
lt's their America, and their deadline
is progressing in less than a week.

26:35.412 --> 26:36.481
l know.

26:39.012 --> 26:40.889
Remember something, Mr. Roth.

26:41.252 --> 26:43.447
They've owned them stores
for over 30 years.

26:44.212 --> 26:48.364
So what if they need a couple more
days to mull over their decision?

26:52.972 --> 26:55.770
These are tense times right now.
You know what l mean?

27:03.252 --> 27:04.162
Shit.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.928
You're murdering yourself.

27:08.172 --> 27:10.811
Golf is a game of finesse,
not power.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.806
ln that way,
it's much like the rest of life.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.647
The key is letting the body
work together.

27:19.092 --> 27:21.731
Get a good shoulder turn
so the wrist breaks naturally.

27:22.612 --> 27:25.001
Make sure you keep your eyes
on the ball.

27:32.812 --> 27:35.804
This shaft, l don't like it.
lt ain't working for me.

27:36.052 --> 27:37.929
Save the excuses.

27:38.132 --> 27:42.011
With all respect to the shop owners,
without the deeds, there's no deal.

27:42.452 --> 27:46.127
Without the land deal, there's no
presentation. So there's no. . . .

27:46.932 --> 27:49.366
-What's the popular term these days?
-Cheddar.

27:49.612 --> 27:51.762
That's right. No cheddar.

27:53.332 --> 27:55.004
Do l make myself clear?

27:55.212 --> 27:57.362
lf l say l'll deliver, l'll deliver.

27:58.452 --> 28:00.443
Hey, hey, hey, now.
Sorry l'm late.

28:00.692 --> 28:03.843
Girl, knowing the way you shop,
l'd say you're early.

28:04.052 --> 28:05.963
Oh, really?
l got some hot stuff.

28:06.212 --> 28:09.249
Good. Work it out!
Your brother's in the back.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.611
That guy that got whacked.

28:13.812 --> 28:15.484
You mean Ch'u's boy?

28:16.292 --> 28:20.729
He called me. Ain't that some shit?
Same night he got killed, Pop.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.570
Jesus Christ.

28:22.932 --> 28:24.081
What'd he want, Colin?

28:24.292 --> 28:28.205
l don't know. Oh, look, man.

28:28.452 --> 28:29.931
l'll holler back at you later.

28:30.132 --> 28:32.202
You be in my office in one hour.

28:38.212 --> 28:40.009
l asked you not to do business here.

28:40.212 --> 28:43.010
-Hi, sis. Nice to see you too.
-l mean it, Colin.

28:43.252 --> 28:47.040
This is my place, okay?
l got kids hanging here all the time.

28:47.252 --> 28:50.881
-lf this is what you're about--
-Don't start with that speech.

28:51.092 --> 28:52.650
For once, let's not go there.

28:58.052 --> 28:59.690
l was talking to Pop.

29:00.652 --> 29:04.565
Look, come on. He's a businessman.
l work for this businessman.

29:04.772 --> 29:07.047
Stop tripping over this shit.

29:08.212 --> 29:10.168
Colin, wait.

29:13.292 --> 29:15.681
Look. l'm sorry.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.451
l just worry about you.

29:18.692 --> 29:20.045
That's all.

29:20.732 --> 29:22.211
Yeah, l know.

29:23.412 --> 29:25.562
And l love you too, Trish.

29:26.252 --> 29:28.322
But you ain't gotta worry about me.

29:28.572 --> 29:29.925
l'm fine.

32:18.572 --> 32:19.846
Serpentine Fire.

32:32.812 --> 32:34.211
Right there, baby.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.241
What's good?

32:44.932 --> 32:46.570
Try the parking lot.

32:48.252 --> 32:51.324
l'm just trying to do my job, Trish.
Just like Mo.

32:51.572 --> 32:53.324
He told me the shit you pulled.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.369
Plain stupid is what it was.

32:56.052 --> 32:59.169
Things will get tense now that
that Chinese dude got popped.

32:59.372 --> 33:01.249
Was that one of your jobs too?

33:01.452 --> 33:03.602
No, that shoddy work's not my style.

33:03.812 --> 33:06.280
l'm sorry. Poor baby!
Have l got you all wrong?

33:07.092 --> 33:09.003
You have no clue to what l'm about.

33:09.212 --> 33:10.645
Why don't you tell me?

33:11.132 --> 33:13.168
For starters,
get past the façade.

33:13.372 --> 33:15.567
You got some serious
façade going on.

33:15.772 --> 33:17.922
Well, so do you.
So does everybody.

33:18.132 --> 33:22.284
And this Miss l-don't-need-nobody
isn't you. Not the real you.

33:22.492 --> 33:26.326
-You saving yourself for Kobe Bryant?
-ls that what you think l'm doing?

33:26.572 --> 33:31.009
l think you need to consider
the possibility that you've met him.

33:32.652 --> 33:36.611
You're an errand boy for my father.
You're nothing.

33:37.252 --> 33:38.765
Fair enough.

33:40.372 --> 33:43.569
But there comes a time when a man
has to strike out on his own.

33:44.332 --> 33:45.481
Stake his own claim.

33:46.132 --> 33:47.167
How did l miss it?

33:47.412 --> 33:49.642
l think l'm hopelessly in love
with you.

33:49.852 --> 33:53.367
Make fun all you like.
Soon l'll be way too much for you.

33:53.812 --> 33:57.691
Those big brown eyes will get all
misty wishing there were two of me.

33:58.572 --> 34:01.405
Fill yourself all you want.
l just lost my appetite.

34:01.652 --> 34:02.767
Sit down.

34:03.652 --> 34:07.691
Don't respect me, but respect
your father and let us protect you.

34:07.932 --> 34:09.159
Do you understand?

34:10.492 --> 34:12.130
Do you understand?!

34:23.012 --> 34:26.163
Mac, you're so smooth
with the ladies, baby.

34:27.652 --> 34:30.485
lf l want Eddie Murphy,
l'll go to the goddamn movies.

34:30.732 --> 34:31.687
Yeah, dog.

34:32.331 --> 34:35.483
Good. Give him some fat-free water
or something.

34:37.252 --> 34:38.764
Where my drink, man?!

34:41.252 --> 34:43.004
The fuck you looking at?

34:47.411 --> 34:49.641
All the way down the end there!

34:56.452 --> 34:58.488
Finish telling me
about this call you got.

34:58.732 --> 35:01.246
Guy calls,
says he wants to meet me.

35:01.892 --> 35:02.881
For what?

35:03.092 --> 35:05.606
l don't know.
We didn't talk that long.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.248
Said he had a little something
that might put a stop to this war.

35:09.452 --> 35:11.204
A little something?

35:13.332 --> 35:16.165
l didn't trust him,
so l tell him meet me at Silk's.

35:20.892 --> 35:24.248
As soon as you got that call,
you should've told me.

35:28.812 --> 35:31.610
Next time l cross the street,
you should hold my hand.

35:31.812 --> 35:36.044
Hey, who the hell you talking to?
l will knock the black off you, boy.

35:36.252 --> 35:37.480
l mean no disrespect.

35:38.372 --> 35:42.331
But l'm just trying to be a man here.
l'm looking out for you.

35:42.572 --> 35:45.166
l don't need you
to look out for me, Colin.

35:49.892 --> 35:51.166
Have a seat.

35:52.252 --> 35:53.321
Go on. Sit down.

36:06.012 --> 36:07.127
Come on.

36:13.012 --> 36:16.971
l've been working on a big deal.
A real big deal.

36:17.532 --> 36:21.411
When it goes through, we're out
of this gangster nonsense for good.

36:21.652 --> 36:24.769
Everything we do will be
strictly legit from here on out.

36:25.252 --> 36:26.651
What do you mean?

36:26.972 --> 36:29.008
l got something else lined up
for my boy.

36:29.852 --> 36:33.242
You will get to run with this ball.
l guarantee that.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.287
But you gotta use your head.

36:36.492 --> 36:37.720
And you gotta listen.

36:37.972 --> 36:39.769
You understand what l'm saying?

36:41.292 --> 36:42.441
Yeah, Pop.

36:44.532 --> 36:46.045
Finish your drink.

36:51.332 --> 36:52.890
Collard Green.

36:53.092 --> 36:54.445
Black Mac.

36:59.132 --> 37:00.451
Something wrong?

37:01.332 --> 37:02.845
You tell me.

37:15.092 --> 37:16.081
Hey, chief.

37:18.372 --> 37:21.842
Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but you need to see this.

37:31.772 --> 37:32.841
Calvin's place?

37:34.812 --> 37:36.723
He was the sweetest guy in the world.

37:37.212 --> 37:41.000
l think l'd better wrap up
these acquisitions quickly for you.

37:41.732 --> 37:44.246
Things are getting pretty crazy
around here.

37:47.612 --> 37:49.204
You gonna be okay?

37:50.532 --> 37:52.045
Just give me a minute.

37:52.612 --> 37:54.045
Okay, boss.

38:16.052 --> 38:17.963
That's it right over there.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.411
Okay. Lock up the store.

38:24.692 --> 38:26.922
-We're going out tonight?
-Definitely.

38:37.572 --> 38:38.891
Follow her.

39:07.132 --> 39:09.771
Ahkbar. What the hell
are you doing here?

39:09.972 --> 39:11.087
l need to ask you--

39:11.292 --> 39:14.364
You get out of my apartment
before l call the cops.

39:14.612 --> 39:15.408
Please.

39:15.612 --> 39:19.287
You're the only guy l know working
down the criminal ladder. What's up?

39:19.532 --> 39:23.161
This is the last number my brother
called before he was murdered.

39:23.372 --> 39:25.249
lt's the number of your shop.

39:27.412 --> 39:28.401
lt is.

39:30.132 --> 39:31.850
But l don't know your brother.

39:32.052 --> 39:35.203
-Why would he want to talk to me?
-He called your store.

39:35.412 --> 39:36.891
But not to talk to me.

39:37.132 --> 39:39.692
A girl who works the register.
lt could've been her.

39:40.572 --> 39:41.766
My brother--

39:41.972 --> 39:43.041
Brother?

39:44.292 --> 39:45.645
Colin.

39:45.972 --> 39:49.681
Sometimes he makes calls from the shop.
Mostly when l'm not around.

39:50.332 --> 39:51.845
Could you talk to him?

39:59.932 --> 40:02.730
That's Maurice and his gang.
Look, Ahkbar.

40:02.932 --> 40:05.651
-l think it's--
-By the way, my name is Han.

40:05.852 --> 40:08.207
Well, Han, look.

40:08.892 --> 40:12.805
They find you, you'll have serious
problems. Go out the window.

40:13.012 --> 40:15.731
No. l like this way.

40:16.972 --> 40:18.041
lt's your funeral.

40:18.252 --> 40:21.483
Dim sum good. You call again.
Dim sum all time. Thanks.

40:24.492 --> 40:26.289
What you doing bothering
Miss O'Day?

40:26.532 --> 40:27.965
He's the delivery boy, moron.

40:29.692 --> 40:32.729
l done told you,
my name is Maurice, all right?

40:33.292 --> 40:35.328
l'm sorry.
l keep forgetting, boo.

40:36.212 --> 40:37.440
Hey, dog.

40:38.412 --> 40:40.721
-You smell something?
-l don't smell nothing.

40:40.932 --> 40:43.162
-Where's the take-out?
-You hungry, baby?

40:44.692 --> 40:45.966
Cover the front.

40:47.092 --> 40:48.764
Hey, Dim Sum!

40:48.972 --> 40:51.361
You's a real funny man!

40:53.212 --> 40:55.680
Mr. O'Day don't let things
slide lightly.

40:55.892 --> 40:58.725
He also don't like the wrong element
around his daughter.

40:58.932 --> 41:00.968
lt's up to me not to let it happen.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.321
Kick his ass.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.963
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

41:29.932 --> 41:31.411
Get up! Get him!

41:32.172 --> 41:34.288
He's headed around the front!

42:23.652 --> 42:25.131
Who that motherfucker?

42:30.052 --> 42:31.770
Great country.

42:33.292 --> 42:35.283
Free cars.

42:52.492 --> 42:56.167
Sun Tzu was lost to us by
assassination less than a month ago.

42:56.532 --> 43:00.161
A grocery store was firebombed
and his wife killed.

43:02.532 --> 43:06.764
With all respect, Ch'u, any of us
could be killed at any time. . .

43:06.972 --> 43:08.963
. . .overlord or not.

43:09.932 --> 43:11.923
We are not the blacks, Victor.

43:12.652 --> 43:16.008
Our loyalty to each other
is unquestioned.

43:16.292 --> 43:20.251
At least let us strike harder.
Show our true strength.

43:21.332 --> 43:25.928
We will only do that
when it serves us best.

46:35.572 --> 46:37.722
Let Kai worry about this.

46:47.852 --> 46:51.003
Han, l don't want to lose another son.

47:04.172 --> 47:05.890
He didn't think you'd make it.

47:06.092 --> 47:07.002
And you?

47:07.572 --> 47:09.051
l knew you would.

47:10.932 --> 47:13.127
lt's been a long time, Han.
Good to see you.

47:13.332 --> 47:14.481
Tell me. . .

47:15.212 --> 47:16.645
. . .what happened that night?

47:17.292 --> 47:19.487
He got in a fight in a black club.

47:19.732 --> 47:23.611
Threats had been made. They got Po
that night, before l could find him.

47:24.652 --> 47:25.641
Why there?

47:26.652 --> 47:28.165
He wouldn't tell me.

47:28.372 --> 47:31.364
Your brother was a loose cannon,
but he didn't deserve this.

47:35.052 --> 47:36.883
Why fight with blacks?

47:38.452 --> 47:41.171
Well, the waterfront's only
four square miles.

47:42.092 --> 47:43.810
Half the businesses belong to us. . .

47:44.172 --> 47:45.810
. . .the other half to them.

47:47.772 --> 47:49.649
lt was just a matter of time.

48:16.092 --> 48:18.128
l was afraid prison would
make you soft.

48:20.052 --> 48:22.327
People don't get soft in prison.

48:36.292 --> 48:37.281
Pretty good.

48:42.932 --> 48:45.162
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

48:45.812 --> 48:47.484
You must be hungry.

48:47.732 --> 48:50.610
Could you find something
better to do than creep up on me?

48:50.812 --> 48:53.565
And besides, aren't you
in the wrong part of town?

48:53.812 --> 48:55.484
At your store,
they said you were here.

48:55.732 --> 48:57.370
Hold on a minute.
Come on, kids.

48:58.772 --> 49:00.967
All right, all right.
Who wants what?

49:03.572 --> 49:05.449
l wanted the yellow one.

49:05.692 --> 49:06.966
Give it to him.
He's the baby.

49:08.332 --> 49:10.288
Stop! You want one?

49:10.492 --> 49:12.369
Sure. l want the yellow one.

49:12.612 --> 49:14.603
Well, you get a green one.

49:23.012 --> 49:24.809
Did you talk to your brother?

49:25.492 --> 49:27.050
What made you think that?

49:27.292 --> 49:28.566
Hey, time-out.

49:31.412 --> 49:33.562
See that guy?
He works for my dad.

49:33.772 --> 49:35.171
He's got a bad attitude.

49:40.932 --> 49:41.921
Who's your friend?

49:42.332 --> 49:43.890
We met in line.
l didn't catch your name.

49:44.092 --> 49:47.004
-What's your name?
-My friends call me Ahkbar.

49:47.332 --> 49:49.971
Well, Ahkbar, this is Mac.
Mac, Ahkbar.

49:52.972 --> 49:55.167
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum,</i> Ahkbar.

49:55.732 --> 49:57.290
Yo, ain't that the guy?

49:57.492 --> 49:59.164
Hell, yeah.

49:59.532 --> 50:02.410
Same chump took Mo's ride
after he beat us down.

50:02.652 --> 50:05.325
Nobody ever kicked my ass.
What are you talking about?

50:05.572 --> 50:06.721
That the dude.

50:07.092 --> 50:10.448
We can't start because we're
a man short. Would you help us out?

50:10.692 --> 50:11.568
Me?

50:11.812 --> 50:13.689
No. l don't know this game.

50:13.892 --> 50:15.883
Man, it's easier than breathing.

50:16.092 --> 50:18.811
Besides, Trish loves football players.

50:22.172 --> 50:23.400
Right on.

50:29.372 --> 50:32.045
Fellas, got myself a fresh recruit.

50:33.172 --> 50:34.651
He's a rookie. . .

50:35.372 --> 50:37.044
. . .so take it easy on him.

50:44.052 --> 50:45.007
Give me that!

50:45.212 --> 50:48.090
The brothers and l
always give rookies warm welcomes.

50:48.332 --> 50:50.084
So don't worry about a thing.

50:50.332 --> 50:52.243
l just need you to stand behind me.

50:52.492 --> 50:56.246
l'll give you the ball, and you run
to the far end of the field.

50:56.812 --> 50:58.040
That's all?

50:58.492 --> 50:59.641
That's all.

51:00.492 --> 51:01.811
Set!

51:03.732 --> 51:05.404
Let's see your special.

51:07.652 --> 51:08.641
Mo's special!

51:11.212 --> 51:12.201
We're coming, boys.

51:16.572 --> 51:18.085
-Run!
-Run?

51:25.692 --> 51:26.681
Come on!

51:34.932 --> 51:35.887
Damn.

51:37.172 --> 51:38.924
Like l told your ass before.

51:39.412 --> 51:41.130
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

51:48.012 --> 51:49.161
Good job, my man.

51:49.372 --> 51:51.727
-Are they allowed to do that?
-Sure.

51:51.932 --> 51:53.445
lt's a contact sport.

51:53.692 --> 51:56.331
This time, run a little bit
and turn up the middle.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.449
And l'll throw the ball to you.

51:59.572 --> 52:00.800
lt's called the ""buttonhook. ""

52:01.012 --> 52:02.331
-On two.
-Buttonhook.

52:02.612 --> 52:03.567
Right there.

52:04.332 --> 52:05.128
Set!

52:22.252 --> 52:26.086
Damn! Shakalack-shakalack.
Mo, you my Negro, Mo.

52:26.852 --> 52:28.080
Break his ass.

52:33.452 --> 52:35.647
How come nobody else gets hit?

52:36.012 --> 52:37.730
Because you have the ball.

52:38.772 --> 52:41.286
Okay. l'd like hut three.

53:37.692 --> 53:38.761
You all right?

53:45.972 --> 53:47.485
Hey, brother!

53:47.772 --> 53:49.046
American football!

53:53.652 --> 53:55.051
-That was great!
-Brother!

53:57.052 --> 53:59.930
-You were great.
-Damn, that was hot.

54:00.172 --> 54:01.321
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

54:02.332 --> 54:04.050
Here's my address.

54:04.972 --> 54:07.611
Please let me know
when you talk to your brother.

54:07.812 --> 54:08.847
Here.

54:10.972 --> 54:12.371
-Did you see that?
-Awesome!

54:12.612 --> 54:13.681
l know. l know.

54:18.452 --> 54:20.568
Pop ain't feeling me.

54:21.812 --> 54:25.441
He still wants me to ride around
with training wheels and shit.

54:26.532 --> 54:29.092
l was like,
Pops gotta understand that. . .

54:29.292 --> 54:32.443
. . .me and him is cut from,
like, the same cloth.

54:32.892 --> 54:36.043
He needs to start respecting me
as a man.

54:36.252 --> 54:39.642
l mean, he needs to start respecting
my manhood.

54:39.932 --> 54:41.490
Shit, l went to college.

54:42.412 --> 54:44.403
That's right, baby. You did.

54:44.652 --> 54:46.449
That's right, baby. l did.

54:47.372 --> 54:49.283
Like that phone call l got
the other day.

54:50.132 --> 54:53.602
Pop's too afraid about me handling
the business and stuff.

54:53.812 --> 54:57.361
But, baby, l got ideas.
l mean, you know l got ideas.

54:57.572 --> 55:01.611
lt's like. . . .
Shit, l am an idea.

55:03.852 --> 55:06.650
l'm about to have
an Einstein moment.

55:06.852 --> 55:09.127
Magic about to happen.
lt's gonna be scary.

55:09.772 --> 55:11.967
Hey, look, all l want to know is. . .

55:12.172 --> 55:15.847
. . .when does Colin O'Day
get to run with the show?

55:16.052 --> 55:18.964
Don't worry, baby.
Your turn's coming.

56:06.292 --> 56:09.443
Sorry, Mr. O'Day.
These things are never easy.

56:12.692 --> 56:13.966
Wait. Wait.

56:14.172 --> 56:16.003
Don't look at this. Come on.

56:16.212 --> 56:17.804
Look at me. Please!

56:19.452 --> 56:20.407
No!

56:38.132 --> 56:39.724
You had something to do with this.

56:40.332 --> 56:42.209
-What you want me to say?
-Go to hell.

56:42.452 --> 56:44.204
-Go to hell.
-What do you want?

56:45.492 --> 56:48.768
You're as responsible as the people
who did this to my brother.

56:48.972 --> 56:50.724
Don't come near me.
l hate you.

56:51.252 --> 56:54.244
You might as well have thrown him
out that window yourself.

57:10.252 --> 57:12.004
That was my boy, Mac.

57:14.012 --> 57:15.081
l know.

57:22.412 --> 57:24.209
They killed my boy.

57:27.652 --> 57:29.927
We're at the crossroads now, lsaak.

57:33.972 --> 57:36.281
l won't pretend l know
what you're feeling.

57:36.772 --> 57:40.606
But l know you gotta keep it
stitched up until business is done.

57:43.092 --> 57:44.571
The people who did this. . .

57:44.772 --> 57:47.081
. . .l promise you on my life. . .

57:47.452 --> 57:50.285
. . .they'll be knocked out of the box
in due time.

57:50.492 --> 57:51.891
l'll make sure of it.

01:01:06.692 --> 01:01:08.011
What happened?

01:01:12.012 --> 01:01:16.290
Once, Colin and l did something
we thought would really be funny.

01:01:17.852 --> 01:01:19.922
He hid out front. . .

01:01:20.132 --> 01:01:22.282
. . .while l ran to tell my mom
he'd been hurt.

01:01:22.532 --> 01:01:25.205
Hit by a car or something
really bad like that.

01:01:27.932 --> 01:01:30.241
When she came,
he was supposed to jump out.

01:01:30.492 --> 01:01:32.210
You know, surprise her. . .

01:01:32.412 --> 01:01:35.688
. . .and we'd all fall out
and have this great laugh.

01:01:35.932 --> 01:01:38.446
Me and my mom always loved
a good laugh.

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:44.087
l was about 8 or 9.

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:46.844
Colin was, like, 1 1 .

01:01:49.452 --> 01:01:52.046
l don't remember
how we came up with it. . .

01:01:53.012 --> 01:01:56.163
. . .but, sure enough, l start
screaming and yelling. . .

01:01:57.292 --> 01:02:01.683
. . .and my mom runs out of the house.
She's, like, ""Trish, what's wrong?""

01:02:02.092 --> 01:02:03.650
When l told her, l mean. . .

01:02:04.652 --> 01:02:06.210
. . .the look on her face.

01:02:06.612 --> 01:02:10.810
Even when Colin popped up to show it
was a joke, she couldn't stop crying.

01:02:11.012 --> 01:02:12.604
She just held him close.

01:02:13.732 --> 01:02:15.882
Clutched him, you know?

01:02:19.852 --> 01:02:23.242
l was just a baby. l didn't get it
then, but l get it now.

01:02:23.932 --> 01:02:25.445
Tell me.

01:02:25.892 --> 01:02:28.725
-What happened?
-Colin's dead.

01:02:29.732 --> 01:02:32.485
And no matter how hard l cry. . .

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:36.967
. . .he's not gonna pop up
and show me it was just a joke.

01:02:40.252 --> 01:02:41.321
l'm sorry.

01:02:42.612 --> 01:02:44.330
l need your help.

01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:50.447
l gotta put this thing together
just as much as you do now.

01:02:53.052 --> 01:02:56.601
Gentlemen, we are ready
to approach the NFL.

01:02:57.132 --> 01:03:00.920
l don't think any of the other bids
are even in contention.

01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:03.202
Our package is staggering.

01:03:03.452 --> 01:03:05.682
We've got the money,
the organization. . .

01:03:05.892 --> 01:03:09.123
. . .waterfront real estate
seconds from the bridge.

01:03:09.372 --> 01:03:12.444
God Himself couldn't have designed
a better spot for a stadium.

01:03:13.092 --> 01:03:15.083
That's right. You know me well.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:19.080
lf l say there's caviar on
the mountain, you bring the crackers.

01:03:20.052 --> 01:03:21.485
l don't get it.

01:03:21.892 --> 01:03:23.450
These are waterfront properties.

01:03:24.572 --> 01:03:25.846
They must mean something.

01:03:26.572 --> 01:03:28.005
Po didn't want them found.

01:03:30.652 --> 01:03:32.290
Yeah, but why?

01:03:36.772 --> 01:03:37.921
ls this the place?

01:03:38.172 --> 01:03:40.561
Yeah. lt says 44 Driggs Road.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:46.971
ls anybody here?

01:05:11.812 --> 01:05:12.927
Get down!

01:07:31.812 --> 01:07:32.801
You're Chinese.

01:07:35.012 --> 01:07:36.240
No shit!

01:07:42.572 --> 01:07:43.641
l can't hit a girl.

01:07:49.772 --> 01:07:54.084
ln America, if a girl's kicking your
ass, you don't have to be a gentleman.

01:09:59.252 --> 01:10:00.890
Damn. Look at that!

01:10:02.172 --> 01:10:03.287
They a trip.

01:10:04.332 --> 01:10:07.768
Them little things pay the rent,
you know what l mean?

01:10:07.972 --> 01:10:09.041
Yeah, no doubt.

01:10:09.732 --> 01:10:13.884
Crabs in a barrel can't climb out,
and they don't want to stay in.

01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:16.003
l guess they strange like that.

01:10:16.372 --> 01:10:18.681
Some brothers strange like that too.

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:21.169
As soon as one of us move up. . .

01:10:21.372 --> 01:10:24.682
. . .a crab motherfucker like yourself
pulls us right back down.

01:10:25.052 --> 01:10:26.883
But let me tell you something.

01:10:27.532 --> 01:10:30.092
This place seems like
a piece of shit to you. . .

01:10:30.532 --> 01:10:34.047
. . .but that's still my piece of shit.
And l ain't selling it.

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:37.760
l got work to do.

01:10:38.372 --> 01:10:39.964
Let's look at it another way.

01:10:45.372 --> 01:10:48.489
You got two choices.
You either sign us over the deed. . .

01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:51.365
. . .or l blow your head off
and leave it with these crabs.

01:10:51.932 --> 01:10:53.365
Now, which is it?

01:10:55.692 --> 01:10:57.330
-Yo, yo! Okay!
-l can't hear you!

01:10:57.532 --> 01:10:58.726
All right! l'll do it!

01:10:58.932 --> 01:11:01.366
-What?
-l said, l'll do it, man!

01:11:06.092 --> 01:11:07.684
Go in and get me that deed.

01:11:11.572 --> 01:11:14.086
Don't look at me.
l'll put your ass on the news.

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:17.204
What's the matter with you, man?
You crazy?

01:11:19.732 --> 01:11:21.211
l can live with that.

01:11:59.012 --> 01:12:00.650
How are you? Good to see you.

01:12:00.852 --> 01:12:01.841
Good to see you.

01:12:02.092 --> 01:12:03.730
They don't care about the war.

01:12:03.932 --> 01:12:06.321
They don't care if the damn barge
is on fire.

01:12:07.652 --> 01:12:08.641
This is a treat.

01:12:09.332 --> 01:12:11.971
-What brings you downtown?
-You heard about Victor Ho?

01:12:14.012 --> 01:12:16.242
We're looking forward to
some blowback.

01:12:16.452 --> 01:12:19.683
That's why we're here. We got a tip
this place will get hit.

01:12:20.172 --> 01:12:21.571
You gotta be kidding me.

01:12:22.412 --> 01:12:23.731
-When?
-Right now.

01:12:28.372 --> 01:12:29.407
Get the money.

01:13:40.412 --> 01:13:42.323
Thank you for attending this meeting. . .

01:13:42.532 --> 01:13:44.921
. . .on such a short notice.

01:13:45.172 --> 01:13:47.527
My dear brothers, when you expire. . .

01:13:47.732 --> 01:13:50.929
. . .your territory will remain
within the collective.

01:13:51.412 --> 01:13:53.448
Of course, since l alone survive. . .

01:13:53.692 --> 01:13:57.810
. . .the collective is,
in actuality, only me.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.802
You don't want to be in my path
when my feet are put to the coals.

01:14:14.012 --> 01:14:15.570
Misery loves company.

01:14:15.812 --> 01:14:18.451
Oh, young Mr. Roth,
you sound nervous.

01:14:18.692 --> 01:14:21.889
May l suggest acupuncture?

01:14:23.052 --> 01:14:24.929
l hope you have some good news for me.

01:14:25.132 --> 01:14:28.442
There's no need for threats
or theatrics.

01:14:28.692 --> 01:14:32.651
None of us want to drag this out
any longer than it already has.

01:14:32.852 --> 01:14:36.208
Then close out your business
and get me those deeds.

01:14:36.412 --> 01:14:38.448
Damn. Susie!

01:14:39.292 --> 01:14:42.011
Could you get me Keyshawn Johnson,
please?

01:14:44.372 --> 01:14:47.808
lt's Papa, baby. lt's me.
Don't be scared.

01:14:49.172 --> 01:14:51.527
Listen, l need you to come with me.

01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:53.561
Why?

01:14:54.572 --> 01:14:58.121
l'll tell you.
Just come on out front, okay?

01:15:15.492 --> 01:15:17.801
l can't have you hanging with
Ch'u's boy.

01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:20.766
-His name is Han, Daddy.
-Okay, then.

01:15:20.972 --> 01:15:22.405
Stay away from Han.

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:24.444
Afraid l'll catch one of your
bullets?

01:15:24.652 --> 01:15:26.370
lt is too dangerous right now.

01:15:26.572 --> 01:15:27.527
l'll take my chances.

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:36.687
Did you do it?

01:15:37.212 --> 01:15:38.201
Did l do what?

01:15:38.412 --> 01:15:39.970
Did you have his brother murdered?

01:15:40.172 --> 01:15:41.525
Where did that come from?

01:15:41.772 --> 01:15:42.841
l need to know.

01:15:43.052 --> 01:15:45.361
No, l didn't.
l'm telling you, no.

01:15:46.692 --> 01:15:47.681
l did not.

01:15:47.892 --> 01:15:49.291
Trisha, look at me.

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.685
l had nothing to do with it.

01:15:56.092 --> 01:15:59.129
But one of them's going to pay
for what happened to Colin.

01:15:59.372 --> 01:16:00.771
ls that what a businessman is?

01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:03.247
That's what l call
protecting my family.

01:16:07.172 --> 01:16:09.083
You can't touch me!

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:10.881
lnterception, baby!

01:16:11.452 --> 01:16:12.931
-Come on, man.
-Running it back!

01:16:13.132 --> 01:16:14.850
Look at that!
Go back to slow mo!

01:16:15.052 --> 01:16:16.121
l'm coming for you.

01:16:16.332 --> 01:16:17.845
l ain't gonna even look.

01:16:18.052 --> 01:16:20.247
l'm just gonna play.
l can't see!

01:16:33.532 --> 01:16:34.760
He could go. . .

01:16:34.972 --> 01:16:37.042
. . .all the way!

01:16:39.372 --> 01:16:40.441
How your mama doing?

01:16:40.772 --> 01:16:41.727
How your mama doing?!

01:16:42.572 --> 01:16:44.563
Touchdown, baby!

01:16:45.892 --> 01:16:46.881
Take it, take it!

01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:50.680
These nuts in your mouth.

01:16:50.892 --> 01:16:52.962
l said, put the nuts in your mou--

01:16:54.252 --> 01:16:55.970
Why y'all not working?! Get to work!

01:16:57.092 --> 01:16:58.491
Shiftless Negroes.

01:16:59.372 --> 01:17:00.646
Toby! Go on!

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:04.131
Where is Mac, Maurice?

01:17:04.332 --> 01:17:05.560
He's out back.

01:17:05.812 --> 01:17:06.881
l want to talk to him.

01:17:07.212 --> 01:17:08.122
Yes, sir.

01:17:20.212 --> 01:17:21.804
You sure you don't want nothing?

01:17:22.132 --> 01:17:23.963
No, l'm okay.

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:25.446
l'll be downstairs.

01:17:25.692 --> 01:17:26.807
All right.

01:17:58.172 --> 01:17:59.969
l remember sitting in that chair. . .

01:18:00.172 --> 01:18:03.130
. . .watching you fix your hair
for your first date.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.884
You hooked me up with Dexter Benson.

01:18:07.492 --> 01:18:09.403
My man Dex.

01:18:10.772 --> 01:18:13.081
-l really liked that boy.
-Please, Daddy.

01:18:13.292 --> 01:18:16.170
He was so scared, he bit my lip
when he kissed me good night.

01:18:16.372 --> 01:18:17.566
Wait a second.

01:18:18.372 --> 01:18:20.647
You didn't kiss that boy
on your first date.

01:18:20.852 --> 01:18:22.524
That's right, l did.

01:18:23.252 --> 01:18:26.085
l guess l was trying
to get back at you.

01:18:27.212 --> 01:18:28.964
You know, l hate to admit it. . .

01:18:29.652 --> 01:18:31.165
. . .but l miss those times.

01:18:38.852 --> 01:18:41.525
l can tell you
when l missed your ma the most.

01:18:42.132 --> 01:18:45.010
At your graduations and your dates.

01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:48.685
l know l ain't never been able
to talk to you.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:51.728
There's a lot of things
l wanted to say.

01:18:52.252 --> 01:18:54.846
lt don't ever come out right.
l know that.

01:19:03.732 --> 01:19:05.802
l want you in my life.

01:19:06.812 --> 01:19:07.881
There are. . .

01:19:08.492 --> 01:19:09.686
. . .certain things. . . .

01:19:09.892 --> 01:19:11.610
Until l can prove these things. . .

01:19:11.812 --> 01:19:13.404
. . .l want you to stay here with me.

01:19:14.092 --> 01:19:15.161
Listen to me.

01:19:15.372 --> 01:19:18.648
People out there will
try to hurt me by hurting you.

01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:20.285
Like they did your brother.

01:19:20.492 --> 01:19:23.325
l'll be damned
if l let them do that.

01:19:24.492 --> 01:19:25.402
Who is it?

01:19:25.652 --> 01:19:26.721
You got a phone call.

01:19:26.932 --> 01:19:28.047
Not now, Mac.

01:19:28.252 --> 01:19:29.446
lt's Roth.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.684
Today's a good day.

01:19:32.972 --> 01:19:34.530
lt's deed day.

01:19:35.012 --> 01:19:37.572
-l trust everything's in order.
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

01:19:37.812 --> 01:19:39.643
<i>Tonight all my dreams come true.</i>

01:19:39.852 --> 01:19:41.729
l'll see you at the club as planned.

01:19:42.532 --> 01:19:44.045
l'll have your check.

01:19:46.132 --> 01:19:47.770
Where do we stand with Silk?

01:19:48.372 --> 01:19:50.203
We're hooking up at 8:00.

01:19:50.732 --> 01:19:51.847
Watch out for him.

01:19:52.852 --> 01:19:54.171
The boy's tricky.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:56.442
Don't let him get the upper hand.

01:19:57.932 --> 01:19:59.490
l can handle Silk.

01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:11.531
Are you out of your mind?

01:20:14.372 --> 01:20:16.442
What are you doing here?

01:20:17.092 --> 01:20:18.491
l missed you.

01:20:18.732 --> 01:20:22.964
You miss me. l'll miss you when
my father finds out you're here.

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:25.686
He's standing right outside the door.

01:20:25.892 --> 01:20:27.371
What'll l do with you?

01:20:27.932 --> 01:20:29.047
Jesus!

01:20:31.172 --> 01:20:32.651
Hey, Dad.

01:20:32.852 --> 01:20:34.729
l gotta go take care of business.

01:20:34.972 --> 01:20:37.532
You need anything,
you just say the word.

01:20:37.772 --> 01:20:39.000
l am fine, Dad.

01:20:39.492 --> 01:20:42.052
l'm chilling.
You do what you gotta do, okay?

01:20:45.772 --> 01:20:48.411
Jesus! Come on, you gotta go!

01:20:48.932 --> 01:20:50.126
No, what do you. . .?

01:20:55.452 --> 01:20:58.524
-You all right?
-l'm fine, Daddy.

01:20:58.772 --> 01:21:00.490
Listen, baby, you hungry?

01:21:00.732 --> 01:21:03.246
They getting pizza.
Say the word, they'll bring it up.

01:21:03.452 --> 01:21:06.649
l'm not hungry.
lf l get hungry, l'll let them know.

01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:09.290
l'll be back after a while.

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:17.924
Damn, this pizza good.

01:21:19.252 --> 01:21:22.927
Baby girl, open up! l got some
sausage and pepperoni pizza!

01:21:23.132 --> 01:21:25.646
Open up the door.
Ain't no swine on it.

01:21:28.532 --> 01:21:31.888
Pizza make you want to slap your mama.
What's this, Domino's?!

01:21:39.689 --> 01:21:41.520
Damn, never been up in here before.

01:21:43.969 --> 01:21:46.358
They got Prince up on the wall.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:49.367
You a freak too, ain't you, Trish?
Where you at?

01:21:49.889 --> 01:21:51.368
l'm coming around the corner.

01:21:56.889 --> 01:21:58.004
Damn!

01:21:59.609 --> 01:22:01.565
So where are we going?

01:22:02.729 --> 01:22:03.923
Look.

01:22:04.249 --> 01:22:07.924
All the places on this list
have been moved out or burned out.

01:22:08.129 --> 01:22:09.198
Except this one.

01:22:11.369 --> 01:22:12.358
l know this one.

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:16.197
My father and Mac talked about that.
lt's Silk's casino.

01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:17.798
Casino?

01:22:18.009 --> 01:22:18.839
Let's gamble.

01:22:19.369 --> 01:22:20.518
All right.

01:22:49.609 --> 01:22:52.123
Now you're giving me some
B-boy flavor.

01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:53.844
Hip-hop.

01:23:00.849 --> 01:23:01.918
l know hip-hop.

01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:15.003
Hey, what's up?

01:23:18.369 --> 01:23:21.486
Come on, he's with me. Okay?
Can you give me a break?

01:23:22.329 --> 01:23:23.318
You lsaak's girl?

01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:24.638
That's right, cutie.

01:23:25.849 --> 01:23:26.884
Will you let me in?

01:23:29.049 --> 01:23:30.038
All right.

01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:32.638
Thank you. Come on.

01:23:45.289 --> 01:23:47.723
l'm not feeling this.
Let's go to the dance floor.

01:23:48.569 --> 01:23:51.845
-lt's not my scene.
-Not your scene? Cute. Let's go.

01:24:47.769 --> 01:24:48.724
Look here!

01:24:49.449 --> 01:24:51.360
Man, can you believe this?

01:24:57.569 --> 01:24:59.161
What the hell is she doing?

01:25:12.929 --> 01:25:13.805
What's up, Trish?

01:25:14.449 --> 01:25:15.677
What's up, Silk?

01:25:15.969 --> 01:25:17.004
Let's talk.

01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:18.244
All right.

01:25:19.089 --> 01:25:20.078
Come on.

01:25:23.529 --> 01:25:25.759
Your pop's running around
like Donald Trump. . .

01:25:25.969 --> 01:25:29.325
. . .grabbing up every piece of
waterfront he can get his hands on.

01:25:29.849 --> 01:25:31.487
Now he wants to be a club owner.

01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:33.526
He's working on something big.

01:25:33.769 --> 01:25:36.363
Something big?
l don't care how big it is.

01:25:36.569 --> 01:25:39.481
Your pops can sweat me,
and Mac can sweat me all they want.

01:25:39.729 --> 01:25:41.526
But Silk is staying right here.

01:25:41.809 --> 01:25:43.845
My sentiments exactly, Silkie.

01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:47.838
l think we all should stay right here
for one more negotiation.

01:25:48.049 --> 01:25:52.008
lt's like that, partner? You're gonna
try to roll up in here on me?

01:25:52.209 --> 01:25:54.200
-What the hell are you doing?
-Shut up.

01:25:54.409 --> 01:25:56.365
Does my daddy know about this?

01:25:56.649 --> 01:25:57.445
Sit down.

01:25:58.649 --> 01:25:59.638
What?

01:25:59.849 --> 01:26:00.998
What?

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:02.804
What?!

01:26:03.329 --> 01:26:04.728
You might as well lose the gat.

01:26:04.929 --> 01:26:07.568
lt's like l told your
punk ass before. . .

01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:09.767
. . .l ain't signing shit.

01:26:09.969 --> 01:26:11.527
All right, l'll sign it myself.

01:26:21.769 --> 01:26:23.725
Well, well, well.

01:26:24.569 --> 01:26:26.560
lf it ain't my man Dim Sum.

01:26:28.169 --> 01:26:29.284
Busy night?

01:26:29.929 --> 01:26:33.968
Ran off with the boss's daughter,
threw a wrench in Mac's program.

01:26:34.929 --> 01:26:35.805
And now. . .

01:26:36.009 --> 01:26:38.284
. . .you about to get your ass kicked.

01:26:39.529 --> 01:26:40.439
Where is she?

01:26:40.689 --> 01:26:43.044
You didn't think you'd get
them panties, did you?

01:26:43.649 --> 01:26:44.638
What?

01:26:44.849 --> 01:26:49.684
Trish. You didn't really think she was
gonna give it up to you, did you?

01:26:49.889 --> 01:26:51.402
Here's the deal, meatball.

01:26:53.969 --> 01:26:56.767
You let me go, l let you live.

01:26:59.489 --> 01:27:01.684
He say he gonna let me live!

01:27:06.289 --> 01:27:07.881
l'm really gonna miss you.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.728
The way you make me laugh.
But look on the bright side.

01:27:11.169 --> 01:27:12.921
Some you win. . .

01:27:13.769 --> 01:27:15.839
. . .and, Dim Sum, you lose.

01:27:30.009 --> 01:27:33.524
The hell what Mac say!
Somebody kill that son of a bitch!

01:27:47.849 --> 01:27:48.804
Get up!

01:27:49.009 --> 01:27:51.045
Get your bitch-asses up!
Come on!

01:27:55.449 --> 01:27:57.883
Dim Sum!

01:28:04.089 --> 01:28:06.523
Come out and play!

01:28:16.369 --> 01:28:17.518
Hey, rice noodle!

01:30:06.129 --> 01:30:07.562
What the hell you doing?!

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:11.200
l hope you land on your feet,
grasshopper.

01:30:11.409 --> 01:30:14.003
You're not the only one
knows some shit.

01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:16.677
-Where is she?
-The Oakridge Men's Club.

01:30:20.969 --> 01:30:22.448
Sorry, moron.

01:30:37.969 --> 01:30:39.846
Name's Maurice. . .

01:30:40.849 --> 01:30:41.838
. . .bitch.

01:30:46.489 --> 01:30:48.081
Cristal, Ch'u.

01:30:49.169 --> 01:30:50.921
You only live once.

01:30:53.049 --> 01:30:55.563
Everything's kosher,
down to the last pagoda.

01:30:55.929 --> 01:30:57.044
You're a good man.

01:31:15.049 --> 01:31:16.767
Spend it well.

01:31:26.049 --> 01:31:27.198
Mr. O'Day.

01:31:27.449 --> 01:31:28.598
Mr. Ch'u.

01:31:28.809 --> 01:31:31.323
You once gave me your condolences.

01:31:31.649 --> 01:31:34.686
l now offer mine
in regards to your son.

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:38.723
There'll be ample time for you to
express your regrets, Mr. Ch'u.

01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:58.042
Amazing.

01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:01.397
How much?

01:32:05.849 --> 01:32:08.158
So this has been
what it's all about, huh?

01:32:09.449 --> 01:32:11.679
l wish my boy could see me do this.

01:32:12.249 --> 01:32:13.728
And could be here.

01:32:14.809 --> 01:32:16.037
Go ahead and keep that.

01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:22.363
l don't understand.

01:32:23.249 --> 01:32:24.728
You just acquired another partner.

01:32:25.849 --> 01:32:28.807
l think it's time the NFL
had a black owner. Don't you?

01:32:30.889 --> 01:32:32.641
You're joking, right?

01:32:41.409 --> 01:32:42.728
You're not joking.

01:32:43.049 --> 01:32:45.802
l'm afraid l already have a partner.
Several, in fact.

01:32:46.009 --> 01:32:47.965
Well, you just got another one. . .

01:32:48.569 --> 01:32:49.922
. . .in fact.

01:32:50.129 --> 01:32:53.678
Don't forget, Mr. Roth,
without these deeds. . .

01:32:53.889 --> 01:32:55.208
. . .you have no. . . .

01:32:56.049 --> 01:32:58.279
What is that popular term, Dave?

01:32:58.489 --> 01:32:59.524
Cheddar?

01:33:02.129 --> 01:33:04.723
-Do you mind if l have a moment?
-No, go ahead.

01:33:11.449 --> 01:33:12.882
So this is the plan?

01:33:14.769 --> 01:33:16.202
You want to be partners with Roth.

01:33:18.769 --> 01:33:21.602
l've been waiting for the right time
to tell you.

01:33:24.089 --> 01:33:26.478
l'm going to the owner's box.

01:33:26.769 --> 01:33:28.919
We are going to the owner's box.

01:33:30.369 --> 01:33:31.961
l ain't playing with these people.

01:33:33.289 --> 01:33:35.041
The owner's box.

01:33:40.689 --> 01:33:42.759
l've had enough of this legit shit.

01:33:44.569 --> 01:33:45.558
What's that?

01:33:45.809 --> 01:33:49.848
l believe they call it
corporate restructuring. Right?

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:54.962
lsaak O'Day Development's getting
straight jacked. . .

01:33:55.169 --> 01:33:56.443
. . .by Machiavellian lnc.

01:33:57.409 --> 01:33:59.320
l almost forgot.

01:33:59.849 --> 01:34:02.363
l'm taking your most valued asset.

01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:08.765
You blaze, we blaze.

01:34:09.049 --> 01:34:10.164
Are you crazy?

01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:15.597
ls she worth $38 million to you?

01:34:16.369 --> 01:34:18.166
Now l know you're crazy.

01:34:19.249 --> 01:34:23.401
You lost your mind thinking whites would
let you own a piece of their game.

01:34:24.329 --> 01:34:26.479
Me and Ch'u had an understanding.

01:34:26.929 --> 01:34:30.444
Anybody who didn't sign those deeds,
we took care of.

01:34:31.369 --> 01:34:32.404
What do you mean?

01:34:32.649 --> 01:34:35.083
He shot them.
l was there when he killed Silk.

01:34:35.849 --> 01:34:39.558
So now after everything,
you really gonna try to do this?

01:34:39.809 --> 01:34:43.040
l have been covering your ass
for years, lsaak.

01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:46.448
Quite frankly,
l am just tired of being your boy.

01:34:47.249 --> 01:34:49.479
Just because you put your kids
through college. . .

01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:53.085
. . .that's supposed to make
all of your crooked straight?

01:34:53.649 --> 01:34:56.482
Man, you want to own a damn box.

01:34:57.249 --> 01:34:59.638
Mac just want to own the streets.

01:35:00.449 --> 01:35:02.405
That's always been your problem.

01:35:04.169 --> 01:35:05.238
What about Colin?

01:35:05.609 --> 01:35:07.361
What about him?

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:10.198
You killed Colin?

01:35:13.049 --> 01:35:16.041
Even fake wars have casualties, lsaak.

01:35:16.969 --> 01:35:18.687
l guess old Collard Green couldn't fly.

01:36:13.449 --> 01:36:14.723
Vince! Vince!

01:36:15.249 --> 01:36:16.807
Damn it, Roth!

01:36:17.049 --> 01:36:17.925
Watch her.

01:37:04.289 --> 01:37:05.244
Go get it!

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:21.198
Take it down!

01:37:24.569 --> 01:37:26.127
Take it down now!

01:37:26.329 --> 01:37:27.398
No way!

01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:28.968
Take it down!

01:37:41.409 --> 01:37:43.445
Why did you kill my brother?

01:37:46.289 --> 01:37:48.928
All that Chinese shit
happened in-house.

01:37:49.889 --> 01:37:52.084
You have your own people
to thank for that.

01:37:55.489 --> 01:37:56.888
Not that you'll get the chance.

01:37:58.409 --> 01:38:01.162
Sorry, Romeo, but you gotta die.

01:38:06.569 --> 01:38:07.763
Damn. . .

01:38:08.569 --> 01:38:10.161
. . .that's some cold shit.

01:38:18.889 --> 01:38:20.322
We've called the police.

01:38:20.529 --> 01:38:23.089
-There's an ambulance on its way.
-Thank you.

01:38:23.289 --> 01:38:25.120
l'm all right, baby.
How you feeling?

01:38:25.329 --> 01:38:27.843
You doing all right?
l'm doing all right.

01:38:30.009 --> 01:38:31.488
ls that Han?

01:38:31.689 --> 01:38:32.678
Yes.

01:38:33.249 --> 01:38:36.127
You're the one who's been
making all this trouble, huh?

01:38:38.009 --> 01:38:39.727
Let me shake your hand.

01:38:43.809 --> 01:38:45.561
You got a firm grip. l like that.

01:38:47.249 --> 01:38:48.807
Stay with your father.

01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:50.323
l will.

01:38:54.809 --> 01:38:56.606
He a lot shorter than l thought.

01:38:56.849 --> 01:38:58.601
-l know.
-He just a little guy.

01:38:58.849 --> 01:39:00.328
l don't know what to do with you.

01:39:26.529 --> 01:39:29.168
Your brother wasn't suited to lead.

01:39:32.009 --> 01:39:33.681
He didn't have the discipline.

01:39:34.929 --> 01:39:36.078
That's why you killed him.

01:39:36.289 --> 01:39:38.041
That's why l had to.

01:39:38.729 --> 01:39:39.764
Had to?

01:39:42.049 --> 01:39:43.038
My brother.

01:39:44.809 --> 01:39:45.798
That's right.

01:39:46.889 --> 01:39:48.083
That. . .

01:39:48.689 --> 01:39:49.963
. . .was a mistake.

01:39:50.329 --> 01:39:51.318
Come on.

01:41:15.249 --> 01:41:16.238
Come on!

01:41:22.089 --> 01:41:23.442
Give me some skin!

01:45:35.489 --> 01:45:36.717
Are you okay?

01:45:37.649 --> 01:45:39.002
l'm okay.

01:45:51.249 --> 01:45:52.887
Come on, let's go.
