00:05.705 --> 00:06.673
-It's the Bane.
-The shape-shifty squiddy
things that made you?

00:06.740 --> 00:07.774
-What do you want?
-Your help.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.576
Do you hate me
for giving you life?

00:09.642 --> 00:12.112
So the Bane get hold
of this thing and they can
take over the galaxy?

00:12.178 --> 00:13.613
Hello, Sir Alistair.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.349
Sarah Jane Smith.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.518
I need to break
into the Black Archive.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.554
We have to get the scroll,
find Horath and stop them
bringing him back to life.

00:21.621 --> 00:22.856
We have a security breach!

00:22.922 --> 00:24.290
(ZAPPING)

00:24.357 --> 00:28.995
Oh, the sweetness of revenge!

00:43.343 --> 00:46.846
Typical. I turn vegetarian
and now I'm Bane munchies.

00:46.913 --> 00:49.449
-What happened
to Mrs Wormwood?
-Don't know.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.051
Could be one of these,
for all I can tell.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.389
-Tap! Come on!
-Go!

00:56.456 --> 00:58.024
Nothing eats Clyde Langer
without a fight.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.159
(ROARING)

01:03.062 --> 01:05.465
Your kindred have the
half-forms trapped.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.501
They are not my
kindred, Kaagh.
Not any more.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.704
I'm like you,
an outcast with no family.

01:11.771 --> 01:15.675
Then they will
feast on the Smith
woman's boy and his friend.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.111
No. Not today.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.550
Kaagh, my phonic disruptor
needs an energy boost.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.251
(HIGH-PITCHED TONE)

01:25.318 --> 01:26.619
(GROWLING)

01:28.822 --> 01:30.156
I think they're done
playing with their food.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.927
Bane Kindred!
Humans are off the menu!

01:37.197 --> 01:38.498
(GRUNTS)

01:39.666 --> 01:42.001
Nice one, Mrs W.

01:42.068 --> 01:45.371
Luke! I told you to
stay away from her!

01:45.438 --> 01:47.207
-She saved our lives.
-It's true.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.343
We were Bane bait.
Then Mrs W fixed
them with her ring thing.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.313
Saving human lives is
becoming a bit of a habit
with me, Miss Smith.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.582
I do hope we can
conclude our business together

01:55.648 --> 01:58.718
before I am scarred for life.
Do you have the Scroll?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.820
-Yes. We've got it.
-Then give it to me.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.956
Somehow, I don't think this
is the right time.

02:03.022 --> 02:04.991
It wasn't exactly
a stealth operation.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.160
Half of UNIT is probably
headed this way right now!

02:07.227 --> 02:09.429
The child is right.
We should be on our way.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.865
And, um, who are you?

02:11.931 --> 02:15.168
Oh, uh, Brigadier
Sir Alistair Gordon
Lethbridge-Stewart, madam,

02:15.235 --> 02:17.303
-at your service.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

02:17.370 --> 02:20.607
I know the last place
UNIT'll look for us. Let's go!

02:24.811 --> 02:27.380
CLYDE: Hiding out in
a flower shop?

02:27.447 --> 02:29.916
I think it's
an excellent idea.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.286
Rani's right, it's the last
place UNIT will look.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.855
Tea. Come on.
Mum's got a kettle out back.

02:35.922 --> 02:39.292
So, now may I see the Scroll?

02:39.359 --> 02:42.262
I should thank you,
for saving Luke and Clyde.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.965
Oh, there's no need.
I am an outcast from
the Bane Kindred.

02:46.032 --> 02:49.035
Their only interest in me now
is one of digestion.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.572
I take the deepest
satisfaction in ensuring
they go hungry.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.841
Don't you have any
children of your own?

02:54.908 --> 02:58.645
Any, what would
you call them, spawn?

02:58.711 --> 03:01.648
No, I am alone.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.750
Completely.

03:03.816 --> 03:08.054
I was alone.
For a long, long time,
until I met Luke.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.356
Then perhaps you should be
indebted to me

03:10.423 --> 03:14.193
for enriching your sad,
purposeless life.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.664
-Don't push it, Wormwood.
-Just give me the Scroll.

03:17.730 --> 03:21.601
First tell me exactly how
you were able to save
Luke and Clyde.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.704
Mr Smith's containment vortex
is designed to draw the energy

03:24.771 --> 03:26.806
from any weapon
confined within it.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.944
How very ingenious
and how unfortunate.

03:31.010 --> 03:34.113
Not another inch,
Mrs Wormwood.

03:34.180 --> 03:38.318
The battle of the costume
jewellery counter,
how very female.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.888
Perhaps what we need here is
a more masculine influence.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.325
-Kaagh!
-RANI: Get off!

03:45.391 --> 03:46.960
Kaagh!

03:47.026 --> 03:50.930
A Sontaran always keeps an
oath of vengeance.

03:51.130 --> 03:54.968
You alien chaps never
get the message, do you?

03:55.034 --> 03:59.105
-RANI: The sonic lipstick. No!
-You will regret
doing that, Kaagh.

03:59.172 --> 04:04.911
You shall regret robbing me
of the honour of Sontar,
for all eternity!

04:04.978 --> 04:08.548
Kaagh and I both have a score
to settle, Miss Smith.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.117
Our vengeance
will span a galaxy.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.621
Kaagh has the
Consciousness of Horath.

04:14.687 --> 04:18.558
He is the Bane's agent.
And you're both
double-crossing them.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.593
I could never
return to Sontar.

04:20.660 --> 04:25.732
What sort of soldier is beaten
by a female and half-forms?

04:25.798 --> 04:29.502
I was reduced to working
as a mercenary for the Bane.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.505
Kaagh was carrying the
Consciousness of
Horath for the Bane

04:32.572 --> 04:37.810
when he recognised
me on a planet in the
Snake Tongue Nebula.

04:37.877 --> 04:41.314
The Bane had put a high
price on my head.

04:41.381 --> 04:45.184
But I encouraged Kaagh
to see the bigger picture.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.420
A much bigger picture.

04:49.188 --> 04:51.224
So,

04:51.290 --> 04:54.927
give me the Scroll.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.131
-Don't do it, Sarah Jane.
-Oh, I suggest you do.

04:58.197 --> 05:02.702
Or Kaagh will
disintegrate your friends,
one at a time.

05:04.103 --> 05:07.707
You're mad!
It will destroy you.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.876
It will destroy everything.

05:09.942 --> 05:13.713
Oh, really, Miss Smith,
you're so negative.

05:13.780 --> 05:19.485
Power has such beauty,
hasn't it, Kaagh?

05:19.552 --> 05:23.523
Power is the most beautiful
thing in the universe.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.591
Shall I destroy them now?

05:25.658 --> 05:29.529
No! Leave them alone,
Mrs Wormwood!

05:29.595 --> 05:32.565
My mum's given
you what you wanted,
now get out!

05:32.632 --> 05:34.867
Such a brave boy.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.604
So much more than a boy.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.873
Keep away from him!

05:40.940 --> 05:44.844
Luke, I will spare
your friends, if you
will come with me.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.080
No! He's going nowhere
with you. He is my son!

05:47.146 --> 05:50.349
And I gave him
the intelligence
to make his own choices.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.518
Well, Luke?

05:52.585 --> 05:54.854
-No, Luke.
-Very well.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.424
Then you all die. Kaagh.

05:58.491 --> 06:02.161
I'll come with you!
But you don't hurt anyone.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.197
-You have to promise.
-No, Luke!

06:04.263 --> 06:06.999
And I promise you,
Sarah Jane Smith,

06:07.066 --> 06:11.504
that as long as you can
resist that infuriating
tendency to meddle,

06:11.571 --> 06:13.706
Luke will be safe.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.077
Take him away, Kaagh.

06:18.144 --> 06:21.848
-SARAH JANE: Luke, I love you!
-And I love you!

06:21.914 --> 06:25.084
We are not finished,
Mrs Wormwood!

06:25.151 --> 06:28.221
Oh, I think we are,
Miss Smith.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.422
(BUZZING)

06:29.489 --> 06:31.858
(ALL GROANING)

06:37.430 --> 06:38.865
(GATE OPENING)

06:39.932 --> 06:42.869
Sarah? Is that you, Sarah?

06:57.750 --> 07:00.720
I didn't realise Sarah Jane
had a nephew.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.389
I didn't think she had
any relatives at all,
to be honest.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.125
We're, uh, not a close family.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.995
Well, you shouldn't
have to wait long.

07:09.061 --> 07:12.265
Sarah's always very busy
with her newspaper stories.

07:12.331 --> 07:15.868
She's teaching my daughter.
Oh, that's Rani, very bright.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.004
All the tricks of the trade.

07:18.070 --> 07:21.741
Oh, I could call her,
if you like.
Tell Sarah you're here.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.944
No, it's okay.
When Aunt Sarah
Jane gets home,

07:25.011 --> 07:27.346
I'd like it to be a surprise.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.382
Of course. We understand.

07:35.221 --> 07:38.090
-Out, half-form!
-WORMWOOD: Be careful, Kaagh!

07:38.157 --> 07:41.194
This isn't a bout of Sontaran
quicksand wrestling.

07:41.260 --> 07:44.530
He is a boy.
They break,
or so I understand.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.099
I'll make sure
the perimeter is secure.

07:49.268 --> 07:52.672
-Where are we?
-Some squalid wasteland,

07:52.738 --> 07:57.844
rancid with the stench of
stagnant oil and rotting
fast-food wrappers,

07:57.910 --> 08:00.947
typical of this depressing
planet you call home.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.382
I like Earth.

08:03.449 --> 08:09.522
Your development has been
stunted by a lack of
spectacular horizons.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.725
What sort of a mother
has Sarah Jane Smith been?

08:12.792 --> 08:16.729
The boy I made
was more than this.

08:16.796 --> 08:21.567
You didn't make me.
You just grew me
from synthesised DNA.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.036
Living here has
made me what I am.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.439
(DOOR SLAMMING)

08:26.505 --> 08:31.110
I'm like Kaagh.
Bred for one purpose.
But life has changed him.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.980
He's supposed to serve
the Sontaran Empire.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.115
Instead, he serves you.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.284
No Sontaran
would serve a woman.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.187
I should blast you into atoms
for such an insult!

08:41.254 --> 08:45.324
Don't you see, the boy engages
in mind games? He's clever.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.593
I won't do anything for you!

08:47.660 --> 08:52.999
(CHUCKLING) You already have.
You are our hostage.

08:53.065 --> 08:56.702
Sarah Jane Smith
won't move against us
while we have you.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.772
Too much talk, Kaagh!
Get me what we came for!

09:00.873 --> 09:01.908
This way.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.850
LUKE: Kaagh's space pod!

09:13.853 --> 09:19.191
Soon I will look upon a
galaxy crushed to
stardust beneath my feet.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.428
I want Sarah Jane Smith
to know she gave it to me.

09:22.495 --> 09:26.966
And that she gave you to me.
Such shall be my vengeance.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.201
Why is revenge so important?

09:29.268 --> 09:34.307
(LAUGHING) Humans,
the runts of the galaxy.

09:34.373 --> 09:37.910
No wonder half
the species from here
to the Vylixik Spiral Cluster

09:37.977 --> 09:40.846
have plans to invade you.
You have no guts.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.183
My mum does.
That's why she
defeated you before.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.386
Both of you and
she will this time.

09:47.453 --> 09:49.722
She will have to
find us to do that.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.658
And to our destination
there is only one guide.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.027
Kaagh.

10:04.370 --> 10:08.708
The Eye of Horath
begins to open.

10:09.909 --> 10:13.846
And the galaxy shall tremble.

10:13.913 --> 10:17.183
Sarah Jane!
Sarah Jane, wake up!

10:17.249 --> 10:20.319
Oh! How long have I been
unconscious? Luke...

10:20.386 --> 10:23.289
-We have to get him back!
-And the Tunguska Scroll.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.958
She thinks kidnapping Luke
will stop me going after her.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.928
If Mrs Wormwood thinks that,
she really doesn't
understand motherhood!

10:29.128 --> 10:31.364
The Scroll is a receiver,
isn't it?

10:31.430 --> 10:35.101
It's searching for a homing
signal from Horath.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.371
It's not so much
a map as a SatNav.

10:38.437 --> 10:41.941
This drab world may have
stunted your potential, Luke,

10:42.008 --> 10:45.911
but you still remain
so very impressive.

10:45.978 --> 10:51.384
So intelligent, so perceptive,
so intuitive.

10:53.386 --> 10:58.157
After 3,000 years,
the signal is faint.

10:58.224 --> 11:02.995
But the Scroll will locate it
and then we shall find Horath.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.865
Horath was never
a living being, was he?

11:07.666 --> 11:10.503
Horath is
a cybernetic organism.

11:10.569 --> 11:14.407
-A computer.
-(SCOFFING) And so much more.

11:14.473 --> 11:19.245
A computer that can
command the physical
laws of the universe.

11:19.311 --> 11:25.151
That can destroy worlds
and give birth to them
in the blink of an eye,

11:25.217 --> 11:27.053
as I gave birth to you.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.589
The universe is
a cruel place, Luke.

11:30.656 --> 11:33.759
It delights at
the tricks it plays.

11:33.826 --> 11:37.463
How could I ever have imagined
that it would come to this?

11:37.530 --> 11:41.867
That my only kindred,
my only child

11:41.934 --> 11:45.704
would be the most
perfect human.

11:48.707 --> 11:54.547
I can see why Sarah Jane Smith
is so attached to you, my boy.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.752
You're not my mother.

11:59.819 --> 12:05.624
I gave you life, Luke.
And I can give
you so much more.

12:05.691 --> 12:10.463
There are such wonderful
things out in space,
amazing things.

12:10.529 --> 12:15.734
Be my prince and you will
inherit an entire galaxy!

12:16.936 --> 12:21.273
You could wield
such power, as my son.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.375
(ROLLER SHUTTER OPENING)

12:25.311 --> 12:27.346
What about Kaagh?

12:27.413 --> 12:32.518
Kaagh is a foot soldier,
bred for war, not to rule.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.154
Unlike you.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.063
Here, my son.

12:52.972 --> 12:55.875
-Kaagh!
-KAAGH: Half-form!

13:07.786 --> 13:09.021
(YELLS)

13:13.392 --> 13:15.828
I will fry you alive,
Half-form!

13:17.229 --> 13:19.398
Bring him back to me, alive!

13:29.742 --> 13:32.745
You cannot escape!
Defiance will be eliminated!

13:38.317 --> 13:43.622
I said I want him alive,
idiot Sontaran!

13:58.237 --> 13:59.672
(SNIFFS)

14:19.925 --> 14:21.927
(LAUGHING)

14:24.196 --> 14:28.200
The Bane woman has
her fancy idea of vengeance.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.804
But for what you
and your half-form
friends did to me,

14:31.870 --> 14:33.872
you will taste
Sontaran reckoning!

14:38.310 --> 14:42.781
No one comes between
a Sontaran warrior
and his prize of vengeance.

14:42.848 --> 14:46.552
Except you're no longer
a Sontaran warrior, are you,

14:46.619 --> 14:49.588
Kaagh the Slayer?
Kaagh the Shambles, more like.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.992
(GRUNTING)

14:56.595 --> 14:58.931
Now, do we understand
each other?

14:58.998 --> 15:03.502
Yes. But not the logic in
keeping a half-form alive.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.172
But of course you wouldn't,
Kaagh. You are a clone.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.742
You were born in
a tub of green goo.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.845
You've never created anything,
only destroyed.

15:12.911 --> 15:16.148
But as long as the Bane hunt
for me, I need you.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.857
(SCROLL HUMMING)

15:30.062 --> 15:33.332
The Scroll has re-established
contact with Horath.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.734
Our journey is almost done.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.606
A new age nears.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.511
No sign of UNIT.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.714
They're soldiers, trained to
disappear into the background.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.251
Mr Smith is our only chance
of finding Luke and
stopping Mrs Wormwood.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.353
Hang on! UNIT don't know me.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.189
I can go in and do a recce,
see if the coast
is really clear

15:57.256 --> 16:01.060
and they wouldn't
suspect a thing.
Clyde Langer, superspy!

16:38.063 --> 16:39.865
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

16:39.932 --> 16:41.633
-Clyde?
-All clear.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.935
Be right there.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.871
RANI: Where is he?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.852
This does not look good.

17:01.787 --> 17:02.921
Clyde?

17:08.727 --> 17:11.663
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

17:11.730 --> 17:13.665
Major, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

17:13.732 --> 17:17.069
-Let him go.
-I always follow orders.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.873
I'm afraid all of
you are under arrest.

17:20.939 --> 17:24.076
Major, I assure you,
you are making an
earth-shattering mistake.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.845
-Give me the Tunguska Scroll.
-Major, please listen to me.

17:26.912 --> 17:30.916
-We are trying to
save the galaxy.
-Just give me the Scroll!

17:30.983 --> 17:32.785
-We haven't got it any more.
-What?

17:32.851 --> 17:34.520
My son's been kidnapped.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.755
I'm trying to save him,
can't you understand that?

17:36.822 --> 17:38.824
My only concern is
homeworld security.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.360
Yeah? But it looks to me
like you're sitting
down on the job!

17:41.427 --> 17:42.761
(GRUNTS)

17:42.828 --> 17:44.930
SARAH JANE: Brilliant, Clyde!

17:44.997 --> 17:48.834
I'd stay where you
are if I were you, Major.
He's got worse than that.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.403
You do what you have to do.
I'll keep an eye on the major.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.339
Rani, stay with the Brigadier.
Clyde, with me.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.874
(GRUNTS)

18:00.813 --> 18:03.582
I registered
these energy readings
from the Tunguska Scroll.

18:03.649 --> 18:07.486
I need you to calibrate and
initiate a tracker search
across the U.K. for it.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.823
When I said my only concern
was homeworld security,

18:12.891 --> 18:15.928
I meant my world, not yours.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.866
MR SMITH: <i>Satellite</i>
<i>tracking now active.</i>

18:20.933 --> 18:24.303
They could be anywhere.
We've got no idea how
much time we've got.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.839
Wherever they are,
however much time we have,

18:26.905 --> 18:30.209
we have one advantage. Luke.
Remember that.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.511
<i>Target acquired.</i>
<i>It is apparently mobile</i>

18:32.578 --> 18:36.381
<i>and heading along the A786</i>
<i>towards the village</i>
<i>of Whitebarrow.</i>

18:36.448 --> 18:40.252
Whitebarrow? Hang on.
We went there
on a school trip.

18:40.319 --> 18:43.288
It's one of those places
like, um, Stonehenge.

18:43.355 --> 18:46.825
A neolithic burial site,
3,000 years old!

18:47.860 --> 18:50.963
That's where Horath is buried.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.799
-You're Bane?
-I'm warning you, sir,
keep your distance!

18:53.866 --> 18:58.370
No, Sir Alistair. Remember,
I invited you to dinner.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.705
And you're it!

19:03.909 --> 19:05.410
I warned you!

19:09.381 --> 19:12.351
I always suspected
that Major Kilburne
was a slimy creep.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.852
Come on.

19:17.623 --> 19:21.260
Well, of course you
can borrow my van, Sarah.
It's the least I can do.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.228
I hope your funny little
motor isn't too poorly.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.131
SARAH JANE: Thank you.
I appreciate it more
than you can ever know.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.567
Don't be late for tea.

19:28.634 --> 19:32.037
-Thank you for all your help.
-Oh, my pleasure, Sarah Jane.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.506
I'll keep an eye on
what's left of the major

19:34.573 --> 19:36.608
until the UNIT
chaps take him away.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.877
You do what you have
to do and Godspeed.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.985
KAAGH: Move!

19:48.954 --> 19:53.525
This is it!
The resting place of Horath,

19:53.592 --> 19:57.195
the birthplace of
a new galactic aeon!

19:57.262 --> 19:59.531
The age of Wormwood.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.800
And Kaagh!

20:01.867 --> 20:05.971
If you really want the
empire to sound like
a firm of solicitors.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.876
No female can
rule an empire alone.
You need me, Wormwood!

20:12.311 --> 20:14.346
(GRUNTING)

20:14.413 --> 20:18.150
It seems you're right.
A blundering
Sontaran has its uses.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.325
(GASPS)

20:26.391 --> 20:29.761
It's a force field.
You've come all
this way for nothing.

20:29.828 --> 20:35.000
Not at all. The force field
must be attuned to
non-Earth life forms,

20:35.067 --> 20:37.469
those who concealed Horath
within its stones

20:37.536 --> 20:42.207
would see that
humans were no threat.
They're too stupid.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.644
Only an off-worlder would know
what was hidden here,

20:45.711 --> 20:48.747
and they would be
kept safely at bay.

20:48.814 --> 20:49.848
(LAUGHS)

20:49.915 --> 20:54.820
How very clever. Yet, I, Luke,

20:57.222 --> 20:58.457
have you.

21:04.896 --> 21:08.867
Of course. I see it now.

21:08.934 --> 21:13.705
It was meant that I should
give you life then lose you
to Sarah Jane Smith,

21:13.772 --> 21:18.377
that you should remain
on Earth awaiting my
return for this moment.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.882
You're talking about fate.
I don't believe in fate.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.551
I made you for
this moment, Luke,

21:26.618 --> 21:30.455
to enter the circle of stones
and to be my prince.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.725
Mum was right. You are mad.

21:33.792 --> 21:40.132
Sarah Jane Smith
was the wet-nurse,
I am your mother!

21:40.198 --> 21:43.068
Now do as I say and
fulfil your destiny!

21:44.569 --> 21:46.938
Bring me Horath!

21:49.007 --> 21:53.478
Like you, half-form, I believe
we make our own destiny.

21:53.545 --> 21:56.381
But mine lies
within that circle.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.284
So do as she says.

21:59.351 --> 22:05.090
Place the Scroll
on the altar stone
at the heart of the circle.

22:13.598 --> 22:17.869
-Do it!
-Do it, my prince.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.806
Come quickly, Mum.

22:27.813 --> 22:32.784
The age of
Wormwood approaches!

22:33.518 --> 22:35.053
(TYRES SCREECHING)

22:39.791 --> 22:42.227
It's an earthquake!

22:42.294 --> 22:44.863
We have to hurry.
We may already be too late.

22:47.432 --> 22:52.871
WORMWOOD: Luke, see!
The Scroll is unlocking
the Tomb of Horath.

22:52.938 --> 22:56.875
It's a portal!
Horath was never
buried on Earth.

22:56.942 --> 23:01.913
This is a doorway
to somewhere else,
another dimension maybe.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.684
-That's where Horath is.
-And you have
opened that door, Luke.

23:05.751 --> 23:11.389
You have earned
your place at my side,
rulers of a billion stars.

23:11.456 --> 23:17.229
Soon the most almighty power
in the universe will be ours!

23:17.295 --> 23:19.431
What treachery is this, Bane?

23:19.498 --> 23:22.801
The half-form has no place
in our bargain!

23:22.868 --> 23:24.770
Consider our arrangement

23:24.836 --> 23:26.605
-terminated.

23:34.579 --> 23:38.583
Join me, my son.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.186
No.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.421
You can't control the portal.

23:43.488 --> 23:45.957
It's too powerful.

23:46.024 --> 23:49.828
Sarah Jane Smith
has made you timid, Luke.

23:49.895 --> 23:55.033
But I shall make you strong.
You shall be a god.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.303
I don't want to be a god.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.640
It is your fate to sit
beside your mother

24:01.706 --> 24:03.875
and preside over all creation.

24:05.510 --> 24:09.381
You are my prince!

-Luke!
-Mum!

24:18.089 --> 24:21.993
-Thank goodness
you're all right.
-Luke...

24:22.060 --> 24:25.530
It never looked like that
when we came with the school.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.805
Whoops!

24:33.872 --> 24:36.942
The National
Trust is going to be
really pleased about that!

24:37.008 --> 24:39.211
A stone circle with a black
hole in the middle.

24:39.277 --> 24:43.114
-I'd pay to see it.
-The portal. It's opened.

24:43.181 --> 24:47.485
Luke. Come with me, Luke.

24:47.552 --> 24:52.157
I will show you things beyond
even your imagination.

24:53.892 --> 24:58.530
-Half-form!
-I'm trying to help you.
Are you hurt?

24:58.597 --> 25:00.432
Come to me, Luke.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.835
Come to your mother.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.139
No. Sarah Jane's my mother.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.911
Do you hear that,
Mrs Wormwood?

25:12.978 --> 25:16.548
Luke is my son because
I have cared for him
and looked after him.

25:16.615 --> 25:20.719
Because I love him.
And you don't understand love.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.520
People who understand love

25:22.587 --> 25:26.224
don't want to crush planets
or take over the universe.

25:26.291 --> 25:30.762
Those people
aren't people at all,
they truly are monsters.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.931
You're right, Miss Smith.

25:33.131 --> 25:37.535
And it is so much more fun
to embrace one's nature.

25:38.136 --> 25:39.537
Get me my gun.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.941
No. I can't.

25:43.008 --> 25:46.144
I have been
a disgrace to Sontar.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.314
I have betrayed the
brotherhood of warriors.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.517
(PANTING) Give me
this chance of honour.

25:52.584 --> 25:59.291
And what more
fun could there be
than to destroy?

25:59.357 --> 26:04.462
With your deaths,
the Age of
Wormwood shall begin!

26:10.135 --> 26:11.436
Get down!

26:18.276 --> 26:19.744
What happened?

26:19.811 --> 26:21.746
SARAH JANE: Mrs Wormwood was
about to discharge her ring

26:21.813 --> 26:23.882
when Kaagh pushed
her into the portal.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.551
I think it sort of
overloaded the system.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.920
-Is she dead?
-I don't know.

26:28.987 --> 26:32.190
-Hey, the Scroll's still here.
-RANI: You've got another one!

26:32.257 --> 26:34.960
Do I look like the kind
of girl who only
has one lipstick?

26:35.026 --> 26:36.861
-What are you going to do?
-What UNIT should

26:36.928 --> 26:38.897
have done when
they first found it.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.634
(RANI GASPS)

26:44.035 --> 26:46.471
Now the portal is
closed for good.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.207
No one will ever find Horath.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.543
We saved the universe, again.

26:51.609 --> 26:53.645
Did we?

26:53.712 --> 26:57.515
I told you when we first met,
Rani, the universe is
an amazing place.

26:57.582 --> 27:00.085
It's got so many
surprises for us.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.954
But one thing I
never expected to see

27:03.021 --> 27:06.157
was the universe
being saved by a Sontaran.

27:12.197 --> 27:14.666
SARAH JANE:
<i>Yet the truly marvellous</i>
<i>thing is to share the wonders</i>

27:14.733 --> 27:18.436
<i>that the universe brings us</i>
<i>with good, true friends.</i>

27:18.503 --> 27:21.306
<i>The people we can</i>
<i>rely on, no matter what.</i>

27:21.373 --> 27:23.475
-See ya.
<i>-The people we love.</i>

27:23.541 --> 27:24.909
Bye, Sarah Jane.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.716
<i>But the universe hasn't</i>
<i>finished with us yet.</i>

27:31.783 --> 27:34.419
<i>There will always</i>
<i>be some alien</i>
<i>species visiting Earth.</i>

27:34.486 --> 27:37.455
<i>And why not?</i>
<i>It's a wonderful place to be.</i>

27:38.490 --> 27:40.558
Just remember who lives here.
