[panting]

00:08.921 --> 00:10.445
[gate clangs]

00:16.581 --> 00:18.975
[continues panting]

00:19.062 --> 00:20.324

00:37.037 --> 00:39.648

[gunshot]

01:19.035 --> 01:20.950
[police radio chatter]

01:22.821 --> 01:25.955
Victim's Noah Valiquette.
32. Lives a few blocks away.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.523
Local PD says
a clown shot him in the back.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.308
- Cut off his finger.
- A clown? Which finger?

01:31.395 --> 01:33.005
- Right index.
- Any witnesses?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.833
Yeah, the, uh, convenience
store owner heard the shot

01:34.920 --> 01:36.835
caught a glimpse
of the suspect taking off.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.141
Now I'm thinking
that shooter forced him

01:38.228 --> 01:39.621
into the alley,
killed him in there.

01:39.708 --> 01:40.926
Did the killer take
the finger with him?

01:41.013 --> 01:41.971
[cell phone rings]
Looks that way.

01:44.234 --> 01:47.107
Uses for
a detached index finger.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.805
- Sending a message?
- Hmm.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.328
You from CBI?

01:51.415 --> 01:53.156
Agent Teresa Lisbon.
This is Patrick Jane.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.332
Ellis Hindon.
Glad your office is close.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.117
This is
a little out of our league.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.249
We tried not to screw it up.

01:59.336 --> 02:02.339
Preserved the crime scene,
canvassed the area for witnesses

02:02.426 --> 02:04.385
and put out a description
of the attacker.

02:04.472 --> 02:07.692
It sounds like you guys know
what you're doing. Why call us?

02:07.779 --> 02:09.738
This is who we picked up
off the description.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.089
[car door closes]

02:17.267 --> 02:19.139
[indistinct conversations]

02:25.014 --> 02:26.885
They're all crying
on the inside.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.887
[theme music]

02:38.984 --> 02:40.682
[Grace]
'You show up here
in that outfit, why?'

02:40.769 --> 02:41.900
[male #1]
'There was
this casting notice online.'

02:41.987 --> 02:43.293
Said they were holding
auditions today

02:43.380 --> 02:45.904
for a circus movie shooting
in Solano County.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.210
They were looking
for clown talent

02:47.297 --> 02:49.125
specified we should come
in costume.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.432
Was there a name on the ad?
Contact information?

02:51.519 --> 02:54.261
No, just the address and time.
What's your name again?

02:54.348 --> 02:55.305
Van Pelt.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.742
Well, miss Van P..

02:57.829 --> 02:59.135
...what's this?

02:59.222 --> 03:02.356
You've got my heart
in your pocket.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.053
[imitating heartbeat]

03:04.140 --> 03:06.490
Thanks for your time.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.405
- I hate clowns.
- Get in line.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.015
[sighs]
Same story?

03:10.102 --> 03:11.452
They all said they were here
for an audition.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.410
Keep up the interviews.
Get a solid ID

03:13.497 --> 03:14.585
on every one of these guys.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.978
Then go back
to the office

03:16.065 --> 03:17.980
and see if you can trace
whoever placed the ad.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.504
Okay. You. Come here.

03:22.332 --> 03:25.030
[indistinct conversations]

03:25.117 --> 03:27.207
- Where have you been?
- Farmers' market.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.992
Delicious apples, if you like
that kind of thing.

03:30.079 --> 03:30.993
Keeping the clowns, are you?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.124
If the shooter's here

03:32.212 --> 03:33.256
I don't want him slipping away.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.215
Too late. He's slipped.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.564
These ones are
just a smoke screen.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.348
I mean, why else
would he place the ad?

03:38.435 --> 03:39.567
But it's a lovely day,
if you want to waste

03:39.654 --> 03:41.046
your time
talking to clowns.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.614
Uh, we have to.
Maybe Bozo made a mistake

03:43.701 --> 03:45.137
and got caught here
with the rest of 'em.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.401
You know,
I knew a clown once.

03:47.488 --> 03:50.491
Catastropho was his name.
A card thrower.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.320
He could stick the ace of clubs
into a melon at 50 feet.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.930
We need to talk
to the victim's wife.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.454
50 feet. Pshoo! Wow.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.154
If the zeta-function
is defined

04:02.242 --> 04:04.287
for all complex numbers

04:04.374 --> 04:07.247
'where "S" does not equal 1,
then--'

04:07.334 --> 04:08.509
[woman]
'To your audience, honey.'

04:08.596 --> 04:10.162
'Look at me. Talk to me.'

04:13.035 --> 04:14.863
I know you're just trying
to help, Daph.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.343
'Tell me more
about the zeta-whatever.'

04:16.430 --> 04:17.561
'You can do it.'

04:17.648 --> 04:19.041
I'm just not cut out
for this.

04:19.128 --> 04:23.741
- 'You're doing fine.'
- 'I'm sorry.'

04:23.828 --> 04:25.874
We made this
about two years ago

04:25.961 --> 04:27.615
just before we got married.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.834
Noah was trying to get
a tenured teaching position.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.575
How'd that work out for him?

04:31.662 --> 04:35.100
Not so good. He has trouble
addressing crowds.

04:35.187 --> 04:38.713
My brother was, uh,
a mathematical genius.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.933
You know, he finished
high school at 15

04:42.020 --> 04:43.935
got his first degree
in, like..

04:44.022 --> 04:46.373
[chuckles]
...two years.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.592
But he wasn't good
with people.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.464
He was good with me.

04:50.551 --> 04:56.078
"Selected issues in the fourth
order differential equations."

04:56.165 --> 04:58.123
[chuckles]
'I guess that was Noah's.'

04:58.210 --> 04:59.255
Yeah.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.779
And, uh,
"Love's tender passion."

05:01.866 --> 05:02.911
Yours?

05:04.652 --> 05:05.566
Go ahead and make fun.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.002
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.874
No, it's okay.
I didn't...I get it.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.789
I know how it looks.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.401
I'm no brainiac,
and if you met him

05:14.488 --> 05:16.881
you'd probably think
Noah was king of the geeks.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.143
What can I say?
I always had a thing

05:18.230 --> 05:20.407
for the smart guys.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.671
My girlfriends thought
I was crazy.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.412
'But when he opened up'

05:25.499 --> 05:28.240
Noah had a beautiful soul.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.200
And I was good for him.
I helped him with the world.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.071
What did he do
for a living?

05:33.158 --> 05:35.639
Oh, he, uh, published
a few papers

05:35.726 --> 05:38.294
in mathematical journals

05:38.381 --> 05:39.730
which, uh..

05:39.817 --> 05:41.689
Well, obviously,
do not pay much.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.778
But he was gonna do fine.

05:43.865 --> 05:48.435
I mean,
he was always discovering..

05:48.522 --> 05:50.567
What do you call 'em?
Proofs.

05:50.654 --> 05:53.396
and, um, inventing stuff.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.789
But one day
it would've paid off.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.574
- I know it would.
- And in the meantime?

05:57.661 --> 06:02.579
Um, we pretty much lived
on my waitressing.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.103
I think that bothered Noah
because he, um

06:05.190 --> 06:06.757
said
he wanted to help out more.

06:06.844 --> 06:10.718
Uh, he started day-trading
a few months back

06:10.805 --> 06:13.460
but...don't think
it went so well.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.679
- 'Why is that?'
- 'I don't know.'

06:15.766 --> 06:17.377
'He wouldn't talk about it.'

06:17.464 --> 06:20.031
Daphne,
he never talked about anything.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.294
Well, where was he going
this morning?

06:22.382 --> 06:26.255
Oh, um, a coffee place
downtown. Ariel's.

06:26.342 --> 06:30.259
Um, he spent most days
there on his laptop

06:30.346 --> 06:32.566
'Um, doing
his day-trading stuff.'

06:32.653 --> 06:34.394
He said he liked
the background frequency.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.440
What's going on with you?
I mean, you couldn't sit down.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.094
You can't stand still.
Guilty conscience?

06:39.181 --> 06:43.011
No. I..

06:43.098 --> 06:45.492
My little brother
just died.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.929
And he was terrified
of clowns

06:48.016 --> 06:49.539
so whoever did this
was sick.

06:49.626 --> 06:52.281
Did you know about
Noah's thing with clowns?

06:52.368 --> 06:54.631
Yeah, uh, Noah
had his quirks.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.373
'And for the record,
where were you?'

06:57.460 --> 07:00.289
- 'This morning at 7:30?'
- Uh, I was here, asleep.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.551
I worked a late shift
last night.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.467
And you?

07:04.554 --> 07:07.339
Uh, in my car,
on the way to work.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
Tough game
Noah had going here.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.301
He...wasn't playing
either of you?

07:12.388 --> 07:14.521
- No.
- Who did he play with?

07:14.608 --> 07:17.219
Uh, mostly one guy.
Uh, Tolman Bunting.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.047
'Tolman Bunting.
He runs a store'

07:19.134 --> 07:20.309
called "The Puzzle Nook"
not too far

07:20.396 --> 07:21.571
from the Valiquettes'.

07:21.658 --> 07:22.833
Phone records show
a lot of calls

07:22.920 --> 07:24.487
between the store
and the house.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.663
We'll go and talk to him.
How's it going with the clowns?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.230
'Kenmore PD found
a clown's outfit'

07:28.317 --> 07:29.536
'on the side of the road
about 3 miles'

07:29.623 --> 07:30.624
'from the crime scene.'

07:30.711 --> 07:32.277
No trace of DNA, though.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.670
Well, we'll put the clowns
aside for now then

07:33.757 --> 07:35.063
but keep the files nearby

07:35.150 --> 07:36.194
in case we need
to go back to them.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.326
Okay, boss. You got it.

07:41.025 --> 07:44.420
[man]
'Noah's mind was exquisite.'

07:44.507 --> 07:46.944
A few years ago I published
a book of number puzzles

07:47.031 --> 07:50.121
and, uh, shortly after,
Noah e-mailed me.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.471
He'd, uh--he'd solved
all the puzzles

07:51.558 --> 07:52.646
of course,
but he had also found

07:52.733 --> 07:55.213
a few logical flaws
in two of them.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.477
That's when I realized
that I had to have a person

07:57.564 --> 08:00.480
of his intellectual caliber
in my orbit.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.090
Mm, soon after that

08:02.177 --> 08:03.657
we started playing
a regular game of chess.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.572
How often did you see him?

08:05.659 --> 08:08.836
Mm... once a month,
I'd say, but we, uh..

08:08.923 --> 08:12.709
We'd play on the internet
or on the phone, and..

08:12.796 --> 08:15.190
Uh, I think you'll, uh...
you'll like that one.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.626
It's rather tricky.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.237
Doesn't this
just kinda go like that..

08:19.324 --> 08:21.109
'around there...
that goes around there...'

08:21.196 --> 08:22.327
over there like that

08:22.414 --> 08:26.723
and...that's it, right?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.072
Very good.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.552
'Yes.'

08:29.639 --> 08:31.902
Hmm. That was fun.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.688
Uh, do you know anybody
who was angry with Noah

08:34.775 --> 08:37.342
or maybe somebody who's held
a grudge up against him?

08:37.429 --> 08:39.823
No, no, not at... all,
but, see

08:39.910 --> 08:42.652
Noah was a bit oblivious
to people's feelings

08:42.739 --> 08:45.481
so sometimes that would come
across as rude.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.222
But he's honestly the-the-the

08:47.309 --> 08:48.876
gentlest person
that you can imagine.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.749
I-I-I can't fathom
anyone wanting to kill Noah.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.403
Were you aware
that he was coulrophobic?

08:54.490 --> 08:55.535
That means
that he was afraid of--

08:55.622 --> 08:59.190
Fear of clowns.
No, not at all.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.018
- You sure?
- Quite.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.325
'Where were you
this morning at 7:30?'

09:03.412 --> 09:06.458
I was out for a run.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.591
Was this the game that
you were playing with Noah?

09:08.678 --> 09:10.201
As a matter of fact,
it was.

09:10.288 --> 09:14.118
Hmm. Yeah, I think
he might have had you.

09:14.205 --> 09:17.034
- You play?
- Oh...a little.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.949
We should have a game
sometime.

09:19.036 --> 09:22.431
That works. I'll open
with pawn to c4.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.693
[clatter]

09:25.303 --> 09:27.392
- Pawn to e6.
- Knight to f3.

09:27.479 --> 09:28.829
Pawn to d5.

09:28.916 --> 09:33.094
Declining the gambit.
Interesting. Pawn to d4.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.357
- Oh, really?
- Scout's honor.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.272
Could we get back
to the interview, please?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.187
Of course. My apologies.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.319
- You're gonna regret that open.
- We'll see.

09:41.406 --> 09:44.279
Did you notice anything unusual
in Noah's behavior recently?

09:44.366 --> 09:47.151
No. There...
there was one thing.

09:47.238 --> 09:51.939
When we, uh, when we actually
started that game

09:52.026 --> 09:54.681
Noah was quite intent
on betting

09:54.768 --> 09:56.291
which he had never done
before.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.553
Did you take the bet?

09:57.640 --> 09:59.381
No,
I like my money too much.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.991
You sure you want
to stick with that open?

10:01.078 --> 10:02.906
Why not?

10:02.993 --> 10:04.908
Knight to f6.

10:04.995 --> 10:05.909
Knight to c3.

10:05.996 --> 10:09.391
Bishop...to e7.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.306
Hmm.
Your funeral.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.570
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.137
Thank you
for stopping by.

10:16.224 --> 10:20.141
By the way, bishop...g5.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.316
Mind your queen.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.839
[door creaks]

10:25.102 --> 10:29.063
Hey, you got a message
from somebody named Tolman.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.281
'"King side castle."'

10:30.368 --> 10:31.674
Aah.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.850
[clicks switch]

10:33.937 --> 10:36.070
As he leans
toward his doom.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.725
Chess, the game of kings.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.378
Kings with too much time
on their hands.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.598
[Van Pelt]
Hey, boss? What's up?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.426
Noah Valiquette's wife said
that he was bringing in money

10:44.513 --> 10:45.557
by day-trading.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.863
- Right?
- That's right.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.865
They had
a little money in the bank

10:48.952 --> 10:50.519
but I checked
his web browser history.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.478
There isn't a single trade,
so I ran his social

10:53.565 --> 10:54.958
but he's never even owned
a stock.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.221
- What was he doing then?
- I can't tell.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.701
There's a lot of files

10:58.788 --> 11:01.008
that seem like
random numbers and letters.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.532
Every week, he e-mailed a bunch
of them to the same address.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.883
- "Beastslayer 949."
- Contact Noah's ISP.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.277
Make them tell you
who Beastslayer is.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.192
Hey, boss?
Daphne Valiquette on 2.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.193
'She sounds freaked.'

11:15.109 --> 11:16.588
- Daphne?
- 'You have to come.'

11:16.676 --> 11:18.373
'There's somebody
inside my house.'

11:18.460 --> 11:21.550
'I-I called
as soon as I saw the door.'

11:21.637 --> 11:22.943
It's alright.
Just take it easy.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.553
I just...I was gone
less than an hour.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.554
I should've called
the police, I know.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.034
Um, I-I wasn't thinking.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.383
How many entrances
besides the front?

11:28.470 --> 11:29.819
- Uh, just the back door.
- Got it.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.647
- You guys take the front.
- Oh.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.607
Somebody forced it open.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.752
[Cho]
Kitchen's clear.

11:49.839 --> 11:50.971
[Rigsby]
Bathroom's clear!

11:51.058 --> 11:53.321
[Van Pelt]
Living room's clear.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.932
[Cho]
Bedroom's clear.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.194
Hey, guys,
you need to see this.

12:05.768 --> 12:06.943
Whoa.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.771
Somebody really wanted
something.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.773
Safe in the floor.
That's pretty old-school.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.211
That's
a high-end sensor lock.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.952
It's gonna be tough
to bust into.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.259
I'll call tech services,
tell 'em we need a locksmith.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.303
[Lisbon]
'Uh, don't bother.'

12:21.479 --> 12:23.438
I found the key.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.396
No, this type of safe
doesn't use a key.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.268
- Oh, yes, it does.
- Ew.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.794
[beeps, click]

12:34.057 --> 12:35.058
Bag it.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.022
Ew.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.389
You're telling me that
somebody killed my husband

13:01.476 --> 13:03.826
and cut off his finger
to get into some safe?

13:03.913 --> 13:06.350
Yes, and this is
all we found in there...

13:06.437 --> 13:08.570
a chessboard, a comic book
and some papers.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.354
Have you ever seen
this stuff before?

13:10.441 --> 13:11.660
No.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.053
Did Noah ever mention
the safe?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.968
No. Never. We...

13:15.055 --> 13:17.318
This was his house
before we got married.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.800
I just moved my stuff in.
Maybe you can tell...

13:20.887 --> 13:23.411
volunteering information
wasn't Noah's strong suit.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.891
Well, we think whatever
the killer was looking for

13:24.978 --> 13:26.501
wasn't in the safe.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.111
That's why they ripped up
the rest of the house.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.721
[cell phone rings]
Would you excuse me?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.549
Yeah.

13:31.636 --> 13:32.594
Lisbon.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.517
[sniffles]

14:04.756 --> 14:05.757
[Lisbon]
'Jane!'

14:09.849 --> 14:11.981
[Lisbon]
'Cho got in touch
with Valiquette's ISP.'

14:12.068 --> 14:14.592
"Beastslayer 949" is
Alec Mosca.

14:14.679 --> 14:15.942
He lives 15 miles away.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.334
Cho and Rigsby are
on their way now.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.423
Splendid.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.252
Did Noah have
any other hiding places?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.602
Maybe. Yeah, sure.
I don't know.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.562
I mean, I feel like
I don't know anything anymore.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.998
I mean,
how many secrets did he keep?

14:29.085 --> 14:31.131
Why...why put
all this junk into a safe?

14:31.218 --> 14:34.525
Well, it's not all junk.
This is a "Spider-man 46".

14:34.612 --> 14:37.093
In this issue,
he takes on "The Shocker".

14:37.180 --> 14:40.357
'It's very good.
Worth a pretty penny.'

14:40.444 --> 14:43.491
But what I find is
interesting

14:43.578 --> 14:46.537
is that the chess set
that your husband has set up

14:46.624 --> 14:48.670
on the table is expensive

14:48.757 --> 14:50.498
and this one,
on the other hand

14:50.585 --> 14:54.458
is made in china...
not so expensive.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.461
So one has to wonder
why he had the cheapo set

14:57.548 --> 14:59.246
hidden away so carefully

14:59.333 --> 15:00.551
unless..

15:03.206 --> 15:04.120
[rattles]

15:06.644 --> 15:08.298
There's something inside.

15:12.607 --> 15:13.913
Locker key.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.393
Locker 42.
I wonder where that is.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.444
- This the one?
- Yep.

15:23.531 --> 15:27.274
[knocks on door]

15:27.361 --> 15:30.494
- Yeah?
- Alec Mosca?

15:30.581 --> 15:31.495
Why? Who are you?

15:31.582 --> 15:33.671
Agents Cho and Rigsby, CBI.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.890
Please open the door.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.848
- Who?
- CBI, sir. Let us in.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.721
Uh...sure.
CBI, no problem.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.418
Uh, look,
I'm in my skivvies

15:41.505 --> 15:45.292
so, uh, give me a second
to get presentable, alright?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.294
Think he's gonna put his pants
on before he hits the window?

15:47.381 --> 15:48.686
No, I do not.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.253
[knocks on door]
Mr. Mosca!

15:56.390 --> 15:58.087
- Let me see your hands!
- Get away from the window!

15:58.174 --> 15:59.915
- Let me see your hands!
- Alright! Okay.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.656
No problem.
You see that?

16:01.743 --> 16:03.658
There's $14,000 in it.
Take that to Mike.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.094
Tell him
I'm good for the rest.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.009
On my sister-in-law's grave,
I swear!

16:07.096 --> 16:08.315
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:08.402 --> 16:09.969
Mike sent you, right?

16:10.056 --> 16:13.450
To collect
on the Boston-Philly bet?

16:13.537 --> 16:15.626
Oh, crap.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.673
Face the wall.
Put your hands on your head.

16:18.760 --> 16:23.460
[handcuffs rattle and click]
Who are you guys?

16:23.547 --> 16:26.463
- Remember the badge? CBI.
- What the hell is that?

16:26.550 --> 16:27.638
California
Bureau of Investigation.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.162
What the hell is that?

16:29.249 --> 16:31.077
We're like the FBI,
only more conveniently located.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.519
Thanks.

16:38.606 --> 16:41.043
Let me say I'm very sorry

16:41.130 --> 16:43.524
for the misunderstanding
at my door.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.265
I had no idea you were cops.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.615
We showed you our badges
and identified ourselves.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.834
You never watch movies?
That's how the bad guys do it.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.010
No, it's not. Sit down.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.279
How do you know
Noah Valiquette?

16:59.366 --> 17:01.759
Coffeehouse.
Uh, Noah likes Vienna roast.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.761
I'm partial
to the Sumatran blend.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.329
Mm-hmm. Is that what
he's e-mailing you about..

17:06.416 --> 17:07.417
...coffee orders?

17:09.941 --> 17:11.030
You should tell the truth,
Mr. Mosca.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.031
It's easier to remember.

17:13.684 --> 17:17.340
This is how it is.
I occasionally place a wager.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.038
Meaning you're
a degenerate gambler?

17:19.125 --> 17:21.475
Yeah, okay.
A couple months back

17:21.562 --> 17:23.433
I'm in the coffeehouse
going through my picks

17:23.520 --> 17:26.741
when Noah asks what I'm doing.
Long story short..

17:26.828 --> 17:29.961
he says he can give me
"rational analysis" on the odds.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.702
So I threw him a couple games.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.140
Bing, bing, bing,
they all came through.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.142
That caught my eye,
so we made a deal.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.579
He gave me picks.
I gave him 10% of the winnings.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.015
These don't look like picks.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.973
Noah said he had
to send them in code.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.325
Don't ask me.
Just who he was.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.109
When did the arrangement
go south?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.545
- Who said it did?
- You did.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.286
You were nervous
ever since I mentioned his name.

17:50.373 --> 17:54.856
From three weeks back, every one
of Noah's calls is a bust.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.379
Guy couldn't pick a bear
to crap in the woods.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.120
I asked him what was going on.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.427
All he'd say was he had
a problem, couldn't focus.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.863
That must have made you angry.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.691
You think? He's got a problem?

18:03.778 --> 18:05.780
I'm the one bleeding money.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.216
But anything that
you might have heard

18:07.303 --> 18:09.871
about angry words between us

18:09.958 --> 18:12.003
bears no relation
to deeds carried out.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.136
I never touched the guy.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.095
Mosca's got two arrests
for assault.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.357
I could see him
going after Noah.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.273
In a bar fight, maybe.
Not in a clown suit.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.277
The question is,
why did Noah's picks go sour?

18:24.364 --> 18:27.236
- Anybody can have a bad run.
- 'But Noah wasn't anybody.'

18:27.323 --> 18:30.587
I mean, a day here, a day there.
But three weeks?

18:30.674 --> 18:32.111
According to Mosca,
he had a problem.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.113
He couldn't focus.
Troubles at home maybe?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.376
That doesn't sound like the kind
of problem he'd even notice.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.769
It must have been some kind
of intellectual challenge.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.380
Agreed. But who could present

18:40.467 --> 18:41.729
that kind
of intellectual challenge

18:41.816 --> 18:44.514
that kind of...puzzle, eh?

18:45.559 --> 18:47.126
Oh, Mr. Jane.

18:47.213 --> 18:50.041
Did you, um, did you come here
to concede the game?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.653
Not at all.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.221
Bishop takes e7.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.310
'Interesting.'

18:57.397 --> 18:59.790
What problem was Noah Valiquette
working on for you?

18:59.877 --> 19:02.663
I don't know what you're talking
about. Noah and I played chess.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.622
- Liar.
- I am not a liar.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.798
What makes you think I can't
tell when someone is lying?

19:07.885 --> 19:10.801
- Jane.
- Huh? Enough, Mr. Tolman.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.890
Start talking the truth
or I'm gonna pop ya.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.109
Don't even think about it.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.937
Put the gun down.
Put it down.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.767
It's soft. It's just a hand.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.116
There's...
there's nothing there.

19:21.203 --> 19:24.075
Just a...just a hand.
We're good.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
Annika, put the gun down.

19:28.906 --> 19:32.519
Why do you have
an armed bodyguard, Mr. Bunting?

19:32.606 --> 19:35.304
Why don't we, um,
step into my office?

19:35.391 --> 19:36.784
Okay?

19:41.092 --> 19:42.311
Sweet.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.357
Do you understand
how important

19:44.444 --> 19:46.707
puzzles and codes
are to you agents?

19:46.794 --> 19:50.450
They protect your e-mails.
They stop credit card fraud.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.495
'Puzzle making and breaking'

19:52.582 --> 19:55.368
'is the preeminent security
issue of our day, and I run'

19:55.455 --> 19:59.198
a consulting firm that deals
specifically with those issues.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.635
- Who do you work for?
- We're not prejudiced.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.680
- Whoever needs us.
- What was Noah doing for you?

20:03.767 --> 20:05.639
That's delicate.

20:05.726 --> 20:09.251
Mr. Bunting, unless you
give us your full cooperation

20:09.338 --> 20:11.253
I'll have
the CBI computer crimes unit

20:11.340 --> 20:13.124
in this office in an hour.

20:15.170 --> 20:18.217
I was grooming Noah
for a, uh, pet project.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.871
'Something special.'

20:20.958 --> 20:21.916
What for?

20:23.918 --> 20:26.225
A device that could decipher

20:26.312 --> 20:28.531
virtually any
encrypted information.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.141
The universal hack.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.927
'Well, that's the crude way
of calling it.'

20:33.014 --> 20:35.059
I identified three people that
I thought could pull it off

20:35.146 --> 20:36.496
and Noah was one of them.

20:36.583 --> 20:40.239
I offered each one of them
$2 million.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.458
Last week,
Noah called me and told me

20:42.545 --> 20:45.200
that he had built the device

20:45.287 --> 20:47.289
but that he wasn't
going to give it to me.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.508
Why?

20:48.595 --> 20:50.553
He said he had second thoughts.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.728
He was worried about the device

20:51.815 --> 20:53.164
falling into the wrong hands.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.557
And that doesn't worry you?

20:54.644 --> 20:56.646
I'm a businessman,
not a moralist.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.953
Hmm. Kind of annoying,
though

20:59.040 --> 21:00.476
Noah holding out
on you like that.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.826
Not really.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.960
You see, I decided that Noah
didn't really build the device

21:06.047 --> 21:08.919
that he couldn't, and he was
embarrassed by his failures.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.399
What if he had
built a device?

21:10.486 --> 21:11.835
What would you do
to get your hands on it?

21:11.922 --> 21:13.663
Anything..

21:13.750 --> 21:16.492
...short of killing him,
of course.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.320
'Cause I found a locker key
at Noah's house

21:18.407 --> 21:20.844
very well-hidden...
a locker 42.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.803
Interesting. Do you have
any idea where that locker is?

21:22.890 --> 21:23.847
We're looking.

21:23.934 --> 21:24.935
'Well, if you find it'

21:25.022 --> 21:26.807
you must let me know.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.462
Because that device is mine.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.812
Not yet.
You haven't paid for it.

21:31.899 --> 21:35.076
I have a handful of lawyers
looking into it.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.817
Oh, Mr. Jane..

21:36.904 --> 21:40.342
...before I forget...
queen to e7.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.171
- Taking your bishop.
- Hmm.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.912
We're gonna need to talk
to the other people

21:44.999 --> 21:46.261
that you're working
on this project with.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.871
Fine. No problem.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.960
There's an Alex Kromm
who lives in Amsterdam

21:50.047 --> 21:55.401
and then the, uh, third person
is local...a Oliver McDaniel.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.490
But I doubt
that he killed Noah.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.491
Why?

22:09.153 --> 22:10.111
C-41.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.218
Oliver Simon McDaniel.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.656
Your file says that
you finished college at 16

22:33.743 --> 22:36.877
graduate school at 19,
and you were sent here

22:36.964 --> 22:39.227
after nearly choking
your father to death.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.185
He's not my father.

22:41.272 --> 22:44.145
He's a cyber clone sent by
the galactic quantum lords.

22:44.232 --> 22:48.236
Oh, them. You know, they're
always up to something shady.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.457
Yes. They're trying
to drive me mad.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.285
But they won't succeed.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.896
Have you heard about Noah?

22:55.983 --> 22:59.378
I did. Sad.
Can you do a shiatsu massage?

22:59.465 --> 23:01.380
No.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.947
Shame. I'm tight.
So tight.

23:04.034 --> 23:07.124
And my skin is
just so dry and flaky.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.865
Uh-huh.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.215
'The visitor log says that
Noah was the only person'

23:11.302 --> 23:13.261
'who came to see you.
How did you know him?'

23:13.348 --> 23:16.699
Um, grad school.
I felt sorry for him.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.179
He was a little off.

23:18.266 --> 23:22.009
My guess was radiation.
How did he die?

23:22.096 --> 23:23.793
Gunshot wound which, uh

23:23.880 --> 23:25.273
suggests
it wasn't the quantum lords

23:25.360 --> 23:26.274
that killed him.

23:26.361 --> 23:30.017
Duh.
They'd use a lorax beam.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.323
Why would they want
to kill Noah anyway? Big wuss.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.761
Quite. His killer
wore a clown costume.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.198
Any ideas who
that might have been?

23:37.285 --> 23:40.462
Assuming, of course, that it
is a carbon-based life-form.

23:40.549 --> 23:43.160
Nuh-huh,
but the clown thing's clever.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.641
Noah hated them.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.643
We understand that you were
working on a problem

23:47.730 --> 23:49.819
for Tolman Bunting?

23:49.906 --> 23:51.952
Yeah. My doctors wanted to
nix it, but I convinced them

23:52.039 --> 23:53.954
it was good therapy.
Don't touch that!

23:54.041 --> 23:55.912
[sound of surf rolling]

23:58.262 --> 24:00.787
[turns off]
Hmm.

24:00.874 --> 24:04.443
[Lisbon]
'Did you know that Noah was
working on one for him, too?'

24:04.530 --> 24:08.621
Which makes him
a big-ass hypocrite.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.187
Why is that?

24:10.274 --> 24:12.015
Well, back in grad school,
we got offered a gig

24:12.102 --> 24:14.235
writing code
for some defense contractor.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.977
Noah passed. Said he didn't want
to do anything that could

24:17.064 --> 24:20.241
harm someone...like this thing
for Tolman is any better!

24:20.328 --> 24:22.112
It's worse.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.724
You could destroy the world,
practically, if you wanted to.

24:27.117 --> 24:29.119
Noah may well have
completed that project.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.905
Yeah.
How are youdoing with it?

24:31.992 --> 24:33.820
Fine.

24:33.907 --> 24:37.824
So not even close.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.782
I could gouge your eyes out
with a spoon.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.436
I'll take a rain check
on that.

24:41.523 --> 24:45.788
It appears Noah may have
hidden the device in a locker

24:45.875 --> 24:48.225
that this key belongs to.

24:48.312 --> 24:51.272
Do you have any idea
where that locker could be?

24:51.359 --> 24:54.101
Sir, I'm a mental patient.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.364
I don't know anything.
Nobody does.

24:56.451 --> 24:59.323
But see,
I know I don't know.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.978
Paradox.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.414
Interview over.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.459
Yes, it is.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.419
Thank you.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.031
It's funny how well
you two get along.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.902
Well, I have
the same kind of trouble

25:12.989 --> 25:15.731
with those
pesky quantum lords.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.254
Noah's ethics should have
prevented him

25:17.341 --> 25:18.865
from taking on the project
in the first place.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.693
But he took it on. Why?

25:20.780 --> 25:23.478
Noah loved puzzles. Maybe he
couldn't resist the challenge.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.262
Well, there's plenty
of those to choose from.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.786
Thanks.

25:26.873 --> 25:30.006
Uh, the prospect
of lots and lots of money?

25:30.093 --> 25:31.442
That's a boring motive.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.443
Well, it's still
pretty popular.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.272
[alarm blaring]

25:35.359 --> 25:36.796
[man over PA]
'Inmate escape.'

25:36.883 --> 25:39.407
Open that now!

25:43.150 --> 25:44.412
[alarm stops]

25:44.499 --> 25:47.023
Oh! Alert the quantum lords.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.982
[imitates alarm whooping]

25:54.074 --> 25:55.815
'Have the Kenmore police
put out an APB.'

25:55.902 --> 25:58.382
And get me everything you can
on Oliver McDaniel. Thanks.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.994
I'm impressed.
Oliver made his own key pass

26:01.081 --> 26:02.822
using information stolen
from one of the guards.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.563
He trips the alarm
to create a distraction

26:04.650 --> 26:05.781
then hides
in the guards' locker room.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.566
The last place they'd search.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.568
Turns out this isn't the first
departure. Multiple exits

26:09.655 --> 26:11.613
unaccounted for stretching back
more than a month.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.310
Hospital security
didn't flag this?

26:13.397 --> 26:14.964
'Exits came up
under the guard's name'

26:15.051 --> 26:16.618
'nothing out of the ordinary.'

26:16.705 --> 26:18.446
So Oliver could come and go
whenever he wanted.

26:18.533 --> 26:19.969
Here's the kicker...he was gone
for four hours

26:20.056 --> 26:21.057
around the time
of Noah's murder.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.537
Bumps him up the suspect list.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.365
'There's one thing I don't get.
Why leave now?'

26:24.452 --> 26:26.019
Why not stick to your routine
and slip out at night?

26:26.106 --> 26:28.021
Because he was going
after the device.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.023
He must have figured out
where it was when he saw

26:30.110 --> 26:32.112
the locker key. Would have done
anything to get his hands on it.

26:32.199 --> 26:33.679
'Did you talk
to Tolman Bunting?'

26:33.766 --> 26:35.594
'He had no idea
where Oliver could be headed.'

26:35.681 --> 26:37.857
If Oliver leaves a trail,
it's not gonna be his.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.163
Check the guard's name
and run his credit cards.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.601
The security pass may not be
the only thing Oliver copied.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.645
Yeah, you got it.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.910
- Hey, Grace.
- Hey.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.304
Um, if I wanted to go away
by the ocean

26:50.391 --> 26:54.569
you know, somewhere close,
kind of a resort-type thing.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.266
Spa treatments?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.268
Yeah. Yeah, that kind of thing,
exactly.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.793
Oh, yeah,
that's what I'm talkin' about.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.578
Um, is there any places
that you'd recommend?

27:03.665 --> 27:05.188
I'm kind of busy here, Jane.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.147
Well, can't you just
look it up on your computer?

27:07.234 --> 27:09.453
- It'll take, like, ten seconds.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

27:09.540 --> 27:11.368
I'll get you a nougat bar
from the, uh

27:11.455 --> 27:12.674
'machine over there.'

27:15.503 --> 27:16.896
Give me five minutes.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.506
You are the queen
of my heart, Grace.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.682
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll wait here.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.512
'Thank you.'

27:35.131 --> 27:36.742
Welcome to Tidewater, sir.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.396
Oh, thank you.
Very, uh, lovely place.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.312
We like to think so. Is there
something I can help you with?

27:42.399 --> 27:44.140
Uh, yes, there is.

27:44.227 --> 27:48.144
Um, how is your staff at
procuring, uh things for guests?

27:48.231 --> 27:50.756
- Um, what do you mean?
- You know, special things.

27:50.843 --> 27:52.148
If it's company
you're looking for--

27:52.235 --> 27:56.370
No, it's, uh, it's not
company I'm looking for.

27:56.457 --> 27:59.373
But thank you,
if you're offering company..

27:59.460 --> 28:00.417
...Gary.

28:02.245 --> 28:03.203
[typing]

28:05.161 --> 28:06.815
Got a hit
on the guard's credit card.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.251
Somebody used it to buy
a ticket to Brazil

28:08.338 --> 28:09.775
departing out of SFO
in an hour.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.124
Tell the airport police
we're on our way.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.125
You got it.

28:15.476 --> 28:16.433
[cell phone rings]

28:20.133 --> 28:21.874
- What, Jane?
- What's up, Lisbon?

28:21.961 --> 28:23.614
Oh, nothing much.
Might make a run

28:23.702 --> 28:26.487
to the San Francisco airport
to pick up Oliver McDaniel.

28:26.574 --> 28:29.098
Huh. Well, you may want
to rethink that.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.458
Where is he?

28:41.545 --> 28:45.724
Hey. Isn't this lovely?
Smell of the ocean air

28:45.811 --> 28:48.074
sand beneath your feet.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.293
You know, we should
move our offices here.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.426
Oliver...Jane, where is he?

28:52.513 --> 28:55.951
You'd be so much happier...do
wonders for your stress levels.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.692
He's ticketed
on a flight to Brazil.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.781
Cho and Rigsby are on their way
to the airport now. So..

28:59.868 --> 29:03.611
Oliver has been in an insane
asylum for about six months.

29:03.698 --> 29:06.701
He asked you for a massage.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.225
He's in need
of a little pampering.

29:09.312 --> 29:12.228
- The flight's a misdirect.
- How can you be so sure?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.927
The sound machine in his bedroom
was tuned in to the ocean.

29:15.014 --> 29:19.061
That, and the fact
that room 6-4-4

29:19.148 --> 29:21.150
has already ordered
six cans of SpaghettiO's

29:21.237 --> 29:22.630
from the concierge.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.067
- You can't arrest him yet.
- Yes, I can.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.287
No, you can't.
He escaped because he knows

29:27.374 --> 29:29.419
the location of the device,
and if we follow him

29:29.506 --> 29:30.769
he will lead us right to it.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.248
I don't care about the device.

29:32.335 --> 29:33.989
You don't care about
a code-breaking device

29:34.076 --> 29:35.643
that could hack
into our government's

29:35.730 --> 29:40.387
national security system? That's
not very patriotic, Lisbon.

29:40.474 --> 29:41.431
Piña colada?

29:47.916 --> 29:51.006
Rook to b8?

29:51.093 --> 29:52.791
Poor, deluded fool.

29:54.836 --> 29:58.448
Bunting will be resigned before
lunch, the way he's playing.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.320
Great.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.193
'Bishop..'

30:04.280 --> 30:06.543
...to c4.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.331
'There he is.'

30:11.418 --> 30:12.898
Cho, we have a visual.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.987
We'll take point.
You and Rigsby hang back.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.641
[indistinct conversations]

30:24.300 --> 30:25.824
[laughing]

30:25.911 --> 30:27.303
Ooh!

30:35.921 --> 30:38.575
He's headed in now.
Let's see where he's going.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.057
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

30:44.364 --> 30:46.148
Come on!

31:20.748 --> 31:22.010
Who was that?

31:22.097 --> 31:22.968
[breathing heavily]
I don't know.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.274
Watch Oliver. Cho, come on.

31:28.234 --> 31:29.322
Need a paramedic at the pier.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.332
CBI. Don't move!

32:05.184 --> 32:06.228
42.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.226
Don't move!

32:50.098 --> 32:51.099
'Mr. Bunting?'

32:52.405 --> 32:54.537
4 and 2.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.369
One, two.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.159
Yeah.

33:11.337 --> 33:12.947
Nice work,
tailing us to the pier.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.905
But I guess for a guy
who's after the universal hack

33:14.993 --> 33:18.257
listening in on police radios
is no big thing.

33:18.344 --> 33:21.042
It was, uh,
an unseasonably warm day.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.218
I wanted to cool off
by the water.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.090
It was pure coincidence
that drew me there.

33:25.177 --> 33:29.703
This isn't funny, Mr. Bunting.
You're in trouble.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.226
We've got a big handful
of felonies

33:31.313 --> 33:32.706
for what you did
at the pier today

33:32.793 --> 33:34.925
and we are this close to
nailing you for the murder

33:35.013 --> 33:36.144
of Noah Valiquette.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.276
Really?

33:37.363 --> 33:39.669
Really. The clown costume

33:39.756 --> 33:41.323
the ad...sounds like the work

33:41.410 --> 33:44.196
of a man who likes
to play games, doesn't it?

33:44.283 --> 33:47.373
Hey, boss. AG's on the phone,
says it's urgent.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.115
Oh, uh, do me a favor
and, uh, send my best

33:50.202 --> 33:51.986
to the attorney general.

33:52.073 --> 33:55.120
And tell Mr. Jane
queen to d8.

33:55.207 --> 33:58.427
Queen to d8! Thank you.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.172
You knew where Noah
hid the device.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.739
How?

34:05.826 --> 34:08.481
In grad school, Noah and I
would go to the pier.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.961
Noah liked the rides.
I liked the beach.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.574
All those young women
in wet bathing suits.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.880
I knew Noah hid the device there
as soon as I saw that key.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.579
So you decided to escape
and get it for yourself.

34:19.666 --> 34:22.799
I wanted the money. There's
an intergalactic war coming.

34:22.886 --> 34:24.671
- Yes, I'm aware.
- Hmm.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.325
But if you take
the device to Tolman

34:26.412 --> 34:28.109
you know we're waiting
for you in the lobby.

34:28.196 --> 34:31.025
Well, I wanted the device
so I could see how it worked.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.072
After that, I could make my own,
sell 'em wherever

34:34.159 --> 34:35.812
have enough money
to build my bunker.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.597
Now the hospital security logs
have you out

34:37.684 --> 34:39.773
the morning of
Noah's murder. War preparations?

34:39.860 --> 34:42.471
No, man. Breakfast
at my favorite strip club.

34:42.558 --> 34:45.561
They have an open buffet,
all you can eat.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.433
And Noah's killer planned
an elaborate diversion

34:47.520 --> 34:48.782
to get away
from the crime scene

34:48.869 --> 34:51.176
like your ticket
to Brazil stunt.

34:51.263 --> 34:54.483
I wasn't aware it was a crime
to be intelligent, Agent Cho.

34:56.703 --> 34:59.706
The AG insists I let
Bunting go, drop all charges.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.099
The man must have
serious juice.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.535
Well, it stands to reason.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.754
He knows where the skeletons
are buried.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.191
I don't know what to do.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.454
How do you build a case
against a guy like this?

35:08.541 --> 35:10.847
Oh...it's not so hard.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.590
Talk to the girls
at the strip club.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.679
Someone's gotta
remember I was there.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.681
He speaks the truth, Cho.

35:18.768 --> 35:22.076
Oliver here would have trouble
killing a light beer..

35:22.163 --> 35:23.556
...much less
Noah Valiquette.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.035
That's not accurate.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.820
I could mess you up badly
if I wanted to.

35:26.907 --> 35:30.432
But you don't want to. Before
we let you walk out the door

35:30.519 --> 35:31.825
I need a favor.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.566
- Not a chance.
- Consider it.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.742
It'll give you
the chance to work with this

35:35.829 --> 35:37.047
and then when you're done,
a little gift

35:37.135 --> 35:39.311
from the planetary league.
Hmm?

35:46.492 --> 35:48.233
'Rook takes f6.'

35:48.320 --> 35:51.410
Your very friendly assistant
let me in.

35:51.497 --> 35:54.326
Rook takes f6.

35:54.413 --> 35:58.025
King to g8.
What are you doing here?

35:58.112 --> 36:03.552
I came by to see if Noah's
doohickey here...actually works.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.076
- That's it?
- Yes.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.339
So he did build it.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.645
Yes, and I'm here
to return it..

36:09.732 --> 36:11.995
...for $2 million, of course.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.216
[chuckles]
You expect me to pay you?

36:15.303 --> 36:18.088
Well, not me, no,
but its rightful owners.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.570
Uh, have you met Noah's wife
Daphne and brother Rafe?

36:21.657 --> 36:25.487
Legally, Noah's property
is passed on to Daphne

36:25.574 --> 36:29.187
including this. Have either
of you ever seen this before?

36:29.274 --> 36:30.710
- No.
- What is it?

36:30.797 --> 36:33.843
Uh, it's a code-breaking device
designed by Noah

36:33.930 --> 36:37.412
for Mr. Bunting, uh,
in return for $2 million.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.719
- Your $2 million.
- Oh, my God.

36:39.806 --> 36:42.112
'I'm sure a cashier's check
will be fine, Mr. Bunting.'

36:42.200 --> 36:45.028
Uh, I think we first have to
make sure that this thing works.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.291
That was part
of our arrangement.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.379
As you wish.

36:52.732 --> 36:53.733
Hmm.

36:55.169 --> 36:56.257
Whoa.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.001
Okay, we're gonna
need an encrypted file.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.611
[Patrick]
'Oh, how about
Agent Lisbon's'

37:02.698 --> 37:03.569
'personnel file?'

37:03.656 --> 37:05.048
No.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.963
I happen to have it
on disk right here.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.617
- It has some great photos.
- Fine.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.670
[taps keys]

37:17.757 --> 37:19.672
[Patrick]
'It seems
to be working here.'

37:23.110 --> 37:24.416
[Tolman]
'Hmm.'

37:24.503 --> 37:25.417
What does that mean?

37:25.504 --> 37:29.334
It means that it's not working.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.901
It seems Noah was unable
to complete the project.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.947
I am sorry, Mrs. Valiquette.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.949
He needed more time.

37:36.036 --> 37:38.081
Wait. How do we know
it doesn't work?

37:38.168 --> 37:39.953
[Rafe]
'Maybe he's playing us'

37:40.040 --> 37:42.129
'trying to save himself
a couple million.'

37:42.216 --> 37:45.263
Don't be absurd. Why wouldn't
I want this to work?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.047
Try it again,
'cause my husband's a genius.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.353
'It has to work.'

37:48.440 --> 37:50.311
I'm afraid your,
um, husband's genius

37:50.398 --> 37:51.530
had its limitations.

37:51.617 --> 37:52.618
Humor us.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.493
Okay, fine.

38:07.850 --> 38:08.764
What's happening?

38:10.679 --> 38:13.291
It's working.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.770
It's working!

38:19.340 --> 38:21.429
- 'What the hell?'
- Turn it off.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.039
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- Wait, wait.

38:23.126 --> 38:25.085
- 'It's right, isn't it?'
- Of course not.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.827
You said you didn't know
anything about the device.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.917
- You were lying.
- No. W..

38:31.004 --> 38:33.093
I had Oliver change the settings
so it wouldn't work.

38:33.180 --> 38:37.793
But you knew how to change them
back. You watched Noah work.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.056
You knew that he decided
not to give it to Tolman

38:40.143 --> 38:42.755
for any price. So you did
what you felt you had to..

38:42.842 --> 38:45.540
You played on his fear.
You'd take the device

38:45.627 --> 38:48.456
and turn it in
to Tolman yourself.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.371
All you had to do
was open the safe.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.895
The problem..

38:52.982 --> 38:54.375
...it wasn't in the safe.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.775
That movie
with the crazy math guy

39:02.862 --> 39:05.778
and the woman who loves him.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.346
Yeah, I thought Noah
and me would be like that.

39:09.912 --> 39:14.003
Hmm.
"Love's tender passion."

39:14.090 --> 39:17.398
Yeah, you go ahead
and make fun.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.879
Life with Noah
was nothing like that.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.229
It was silence...days of it

39:22.316 --> 39:26.015
and books I could never
understand the title of

39:26.102 --> 39:28.017
and no sex
when he's thinking

39:28.104 --> 39:31.586
which, by the way,
is all the time.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.501
I work 50 hours a week
scrounging for tips

39:33.588 --> 39:35.373
just so we could have food.

39:38.637 --> 39:42.292
Anyway, so then Noah
told me about this guy

39:42.380 --> 39:44.338
who would pay him $2 million
to build this thing..

39:44.425 --> 39:46.862
...$2 million.

39:46.949 --> 39:49.996
I begged him, and finally
he said he would do it

39:50.083 --> 39:52.651
which was only right
because it was his turn.

39:52.738 --> 39:55.654
But he wouldn't
hand it over

39:55.741 --> 39:58.352
and you couldn't live
with that.

39:58.439 --> 40:02.704
Yeah. He said
it was too dangerous.

40:02.791 --> 40:06.882
I tried to make him,
but he said that..

40:06.969 --> 40:12.366
...he said I wasn't able to
understand the implications.

40:12.453 --> 40:16.283
So I decided to show
him I could be smart, too.

40:16.370 --> 40:21.462
Or a whole lot dumber.
I'm-I'm not sure which.

40:21.549 --> 40:22.855
Get up.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.639
[handcuffs click]

40:24.726 --> 40:26.859
Come on.
Hands behind your back.

40:37.696 --> 40:38.958
What put you on to her?

40:39.045 --> 40:39.959
Well, I came to it very late.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.308
I could have kicked myself.

40:41.395 --> 40:43.223
The kitchen of her house
was left unsearched

40:43.310 --> 40:44.790
because that was her domain.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.444
She knew the device
wasn't there.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.449
'Oh, Mr. Jane.
Perfect timing.'

40:52.493 --> 40:55.583
Pawn to f4.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.286
Shrewd.

41:05.419 --> 41:08.770
But I gather you're here for
more than just to pin my queen.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.163
Yes.

41:10.250 --> 41:14.080
Actually, I came here
to collect my property.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.475
Given Daphne's condition

41:17.562 --> 41:19.346
ownership of the device

41:19.433 --> 41:21.653
'goes to Noah's brother.'

41:21.740 --> 41:24.569
But when I contacted Rafe,
he wanted nothing to do with it.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.484
So according to my attorneys

41:26.571 --> 41:29.443
that passes the device..

41:29.530 --> 41:30.488
...to me.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.534
I have all
the legal documents here.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.579
If you have any questions--

41:34.666 --> 41:35.841
No need. No need.

41:35.928 --> 41:38.713
It's all yours. All yours.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.149
Uh, I hope you don't mind

41:40.236 --> 41:41.673
I did have a little fiddle
with it.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.283
I just wanted
to see how it worked.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.767
Ohh.

41:48.854 --> 41:51.204
- Easily fixed, I'd imagine.
- Easily?

41:51.291 --> 41:53.728
Oh? Uh, what's that?

41:53.815 --> 41:55.121
That may be part of it.

42:01.910 --> 42:04.957
You are gonna be hearing
from my attorney.

42:05.044 --> 42:07.699
Tolman, one last thing.

'Come and take a closer look.
You'll see it.'

42:37.163 --> 42:39.208
We should do this again!
