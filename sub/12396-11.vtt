00:36.170 --> 00:38.024
I'M FREAKING OUT.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.199

01:01.790 --> 01:06.796
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- OKAY, OKAY.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.698
IT ALL STARTED THIS MORNING
AT WORK.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.132
- FOR THE NTH TIME,
WHAT DO I TAKE IN MY COFFEE?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.232
- TWO CREAMS, THREE SUGARS.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.467
NO, TWO CREAM,
THREE SWEET'N LOW,

01:17.570 --> 01:19.800
YOU MOUSY, IMBECILE TWIT!

01:19.910 --> 01:21.400
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?

01:21.510 --> 01:23.478
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS,
TALKING TO HER THAT WAY?

01:23.580 --> 01:27.141
- YOU KNOW CREECH
IS A TOTAL JAG BAG.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.569
- SHOULD WE SAY SOMETHING
TO HIM?

01:28.680 --> 01:30.318
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:30.420 --> 01:32.854
I FANTASIZE ABOUT KILLING
THAT MAN EVERY DAY.

01:32.960 --> 01:33.858
- I WOULD LOVE THAT!

01:33.960 --> 01:36.155
OKAY?

01:36.260 --> 01:39.320
AND I DON'T OPEN MY OWN MAIL.
YOU DO!

01:39.430 --> 01:43.093
- CREECH, THAT IS ENOUGH!

01:43.200 --> 01:44.861
- EXCUSE YOU?

01:46.840 --> 01:49.707
- UH...

01:49.810 --> 01:51.630
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
DO YOU WORK HERE?

01:51.740 --> 01:55.369
- I'M BURTON GUSTER.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.607
AND THAT IS A PERSON
YOU ARE YELLING AT.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.439
HER NAME IS HELEN BLAINE,

01:59.550 --> 02:01.643
AND SHE'S NOT
JUST YOUR ASSISTANT,

02:01.750 --> 02:05.117
SHE'S A HUMAN BEING, SO YOU
CAN'T JUST TALK TO HER THAT WAY,

02:05.220 --> 02:07.154
NOT AS LONG AS I HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.158
- WHOA.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.154
YOU ACTUALLY SAID THAT?
OUT LOUD?

02:10.260 --> 02:11.329
- I DID.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.125
I WISH IT ENDED THERE...

02:13.230 --> 02:15.528
BUT IT DOESN'T.

02:15.630 --> 02:18.667
- [scoffs]
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.238
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT

02:21.340 --> 02:22.898
BECAUSE I'M YOUR BOSS,

02:23.010 --> 02:27.174
AND YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A SCARED,
WEAK, PATHETIC PEON.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.804
RUN ALONG NOW.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.812
HELEN, GET IN HERE!

02:38.920 --> 02:41.650
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE SAN ANTONIO EMAIL?

02:41.760 --> 02:43.887
- I SENT IT.
- WHEN DID YOU SEND IT?

02:43.990 --> 02:46.629
- THIS MORNING.
- TO THE WRONG PERSON!

02:46.730 --> 02:49.290
DO YOU KNOW THAT?
50 NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.698
WHAT IS SAN ANTONIO
GONNA DO NOW

02:51.800 --> 02:54.837
TO GET THE NUMBERS
TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE?

02:59.510 --> 03:01.876
- TAKE THIS
TO CREECH'S OFFICE.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.189
- WHAT?

03:10.290 --> 03:11.917
RIGHT ON, BUDDY, RIGHT ON!

03:12.020 --> 03:13.715
- NO, NOT RIGHT ON, SHAWN.
NOT AT ALL RIGHT ON.

03:13.820 --> 03:16.380
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
GET BACK OVER THERE, MAN.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.287
I'M PROUD OF YOU, MAN,

03:18.390 --> 03:19.823
NOT JUST STANDING UP
FOR THAT GIRL

03:19.930 --> 03:22.421
BUT FOR STICKING IT
TO YOUR BOSS ON YOUR OWN BEHALF.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.896
TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T EVEN
REALIZE YOU STILL WORKED THERE.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.831
BUT IT TAKES
TITANIUM KNICKKNACKS

03:26.940 --> 03:29.306
TO STAND UP
AND QUIT LIKE THAT.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.809
- NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING, SHAWN.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.572
I NEED THAT JOB.
I HAVE BILLS.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.773
I HAVE PSYCH BILLS.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.869
I HAVE YOUR BILLS.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.902
- YOU SELFISH SON OF A BITCH!

03:39.010 --> 03:40.841
THAT IS THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE
THING YOU COULD'VE DONE.

03:40.950 --> 03:43.942
- WILL YOU LET ME FINISH
MY STORY, SHAWN?

03:44.050 --> 03:45.244
- WELL, HURRY UP.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.578
- OKAY.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.885
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS.

03:48.990 --> 03:49.888
AT THE TIME,
I WAS THINKING

03:49.990 --> 03:51.821
MAYBE CREECH WAS BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL,

03:51.930 --> 03:53.227
AND HE'S STILL THERE.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.457
I COULD APOLOGIZE.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.535
HE WAS DEAD, SHAWN.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.801
TOTALLY DEAD.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.009
STABBED TO DEATH.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.645
- STABBED TO DEATH?
- YES.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.809
- DID YOU KILL HIM?
- WHAT?

04:16.920 --> 04:17.989
NO, OF COURSE
I DIDN'T KILL HIM!

04:18.090 --> 04:19.557
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

04:19.660 --> 04:20.809
- WELL, DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?
- I WAS GOING TO...

04:20.860 --> 04:21.019
BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.922
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"SOMETHING HAPPENED"?

04:25.030 --> 04:26.918
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU GOT OUT OF THERE, RIGHT?

04:27.030 --> 04:28.554
YOU GOT OUT OF THERE,

04:28.660 --> 04:32.699
AND YOU DIDN'T TOUCH
ANYTHING, RIGHT?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.495
- I WAS GONNA LEAVE.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.832
THEN I SAW THE NOTE I WROTE
TO CREECH STILL IN HIS HAND.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.809
- YOU ATE THE NOTE?
- I PANICKED, SHAWN.

04:49.850 --> 04:50.009
THERE WAS NO PLACE ELSE
TO PUT IT.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.610
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.312
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

04:54.420 --> 04:57.981
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU DID THAT.
YOU DID THAT.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.626
BUT THEN YOU WALKED
OUT OF THERE.

04:59.730 --> 05:00.890
YOU WALKED OUT OF THERE
WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING ELSE.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.764
AM I RIGHT?

05:03.870 --> 05:09.809
- [wheezing]

05:22.390 --> 05:25.917
- IS THAT--
IS THAT EVERYTHING?

05:26.020 --> 05:28.989
- [coughing]

05:40.440 --> 05:42.362
[yelping]

05:42.470 --> 05:45.109
OH, MY GOD!
I CAN'T--AAH!

05:45.210 --> 05:46.734
AH!

05:46.840 --> 05:49.946
AHH!

05:50.050 --> 05:53.076
- ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.
HEY, HEY, HEY, CALM DOWN.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.772
I'M SURE YOU'RE MAKING
THIS SOUND WORSE

05:54.880 --> 05:56.541
THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS.
- I'M NOT, SHAWN.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.015
- LOOK AT ME.
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.451
- OKAY.
- JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS ARE.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.913
YOU AND ME.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.453
I'M GONNA PUT SOME PANTS ON.
- OKAY.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.925
- I'M GONNA PUT ON SOME COFFEE.
- OKAY.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.850
- WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THERE
TOGETHER,

06:05.960 --> 06:07.097
AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THIS,
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT KOSHER.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.827
- OKAY.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:08.930 --> 06:10.966
- THE MEATS AND CHEESES,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA TOUCH.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.697
- TOUCH, RIGHT.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA TOUCH.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.994
THEY'RE NOT GONNA TOUCH.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.829
STAY HERE,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:22.510 --> 06:23.977
HOLY LIVING--

06:24.080 --> 06:24.978
- YEAH.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.638
- DUDE, I THINK

06:26.750 --> 06:30.516
YOU MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY
UNDERSOLD THIS THING.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.009
YOU DIDN'T KILL THIS GUY, RIGHT?
- NO!

06:33.120 --> 06:35.714
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU'VE GOT
INNOCENCE ON YOUR SIDE.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.128
- WHAT?
- I THINK WE SHOULD CALL

06:37.230 --> 06:38.857
THE POLICE AND LET THE CHIPS
FALL WHERE THEY MAY.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.927
- YOU'RE TALKING
LIKE A REAL WHITE GUY

06:40.030 --> 06:41.520
RIGHT NOW, SHAWN.

06:41.630 --> 06:43.063
BROTHERS DON'T GET THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.694
I WILL NOT ROT IN A CELL.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.869
YOU SAID
WE WERE IN THIS TOGETHER.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.528

THEY'RE TOUCHING RIGHT NOW,

DID YOU?
- [sobbing]

08:16.760 --> 08:18.682

WE'RE GONNA HAVE

08:45.120 --> 08:47.088
IT IS A SMALL GIFI',
BUT IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT

08:47.190 --> 08:49.954
BECAUSE--HA.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

08:50.060 --> 08:52.528
- UH, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT WAS RIDICULOUSLY FAST.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.029
WE GOT AN ANONYMOUS CALL
ABOUT A BODY,

08:54.130 --> 08:55.256

I THINK THE GUYS WOULD LIKE
TO TELL YOU--

09:04.370 --> 09:07.874

- YOU STILL WORK HERE?

09:20.290 --> 09:21.882
- LIFE IS SO FLEETING.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.079
ONE DAY YOU SEE A MAN ALIVE,
YESTERDAY.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.558
AND THEN TODAY, WITHOUT SEEING
HIM AT ALL IN BETWEEN...

09:27.660 --> 09:29.924
HE'S DEAD.

09:30.030 --> 09:32.169
HARK THE HERALD ANGELS.
- WOW.

09:32.270 --> 09:34.636
I'M SURE HIS FAMILY
WOULD APPRECIATE

09:34.740 --> 09:37.903
THIS HEARTFELT
AND DESCRIPTIVE TRIBUTE.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.035
- [whispering] HEY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU LAST NIGHT?

09:40.140 --> 09:42.904
- THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
I DISAPPEARED.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.945
I HAD TO TAKE PAPA BEAR HERE
TO THE URGENT CARE CLINIC

09:46.050 --> 09:48.041
BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING
CHEST PAINS

09:48.150 --> 09:49.071

JULIET, THERE'S SOMETHING
THESE GUYS ARE--

09:54.090 --> 09:55.114
- SIR...

09:56.360 --> 09:57.884
IS ABNORMALLY SWEATY.
- IS IT?

09:57.930 --> 09:58.089
- IT IS VERY SWEATY.
- YEAH, YOUR SON'S RIGHT.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.059
YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.
- NO, I'M--

10:01.160 --> 10:03.924

10:09.270 --> 10:12.876
WHOEVER WE ARE DEALING WITH,
THEY'RE AN EXPERT.

10:12.910 --> 10:13.069
THIS SCENE HAS BEEN WIPED CLEAN
AS A WHISTLE...

10:16.340 --> 10:18.069
WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE
OF FOUL PLAY.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.910
- ALSO NOTE THE VICTIM'S SOCKS
HAVE BEEN REMOVED,

10:21.020 --> 10:22.908
BUT THE SHOES ARE STILL ON.

10:23.020 --> 10:26.888
COULD BE SOME SORT
OF SICKO MURDER RITUAL.

10:26.990 --> 10:30.084
- YOUR BLOOD IS ON HIS SOCKS!

10:30.190 --> 10:31.885
OH, GOD!
OH!

10:31.990 --> 10:34.652
- DETECTIVE,
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.762
I JUST WANTED
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

10:36.870 --> 10:37.894
- I'M LESLIE SALLY,
HEAD OF SECURITY,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.797
CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICALS.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.198
- YOU SAID YOUR NAME WAS...
LESLIE SALLY?

10:42.300 --> 10:43.904
- LESLIE VALERIE SALLY.
YES.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.932
- WELL, UH, SALLY,

10:46.040 --> 10:47.803
THIS IS SORT OF
AN ADULT SWIM TYPE SITUATION,

10:47.910 --> 10:49.172
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND YOUR BLAZER
RUN ALONG

10:49.280 --> 10:51.009
AND SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF,
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

10:51.110 --> 10:52.372
WHO STOLE JENSON'S LUNCH?

10:52.480 --> 10:54.914
- SHAWN,
I STOLE JENSON'S LUNCH.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.942
- LET'S BAG AND TAG
EVERYTHING ON THIS DESK.

10:57.050 --> 10:58.779
- SORRY, DETECTIVE.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.653
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
A SLIGHT TRILL IN MY VOICE.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.409
I HAVE A MINOR FEAR
OF SPEAKING IN PUBLIC,

11:02.520 --> 11:05.057
BUT I WANTED TO NOTE
THAT EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICE

11:05.160 --> 11:07.025
IS ISSUED A WASTEBASKET
WITH A LINER,

11:07.130 --> 11:09.963
AND THAT LINER
IS MISSING.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.423
- GOSH, THAT IS A...

11:11.530 --> 11:14.135
GREAT TIP,
JUNIOR G-MAN.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.334
- DUDE, THAT VASE WASN'T BROKEN
WHEN WE LEFI'.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.437
- DETECTIVE--
- WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

11:22.540 --> 11:24.679
- YOU MAY WANNA CHECK
THE VICTIM'S PALM.

11:24.780 --> 11:27.840
HIS HAND SEEMS TO BE
GRIPPING SOMETHING.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.144
THEN AGAIN,
IT'S MY FIRST MURDER CASE.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.182
WHAT DO I KNOW?

11:30.290 --> 11:34.215
- I WAS GONNA CHECK THE PALM.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.991
PART OF A NOTE.

11:43.100 --> 11:47.969
"'RE AN A-HO."

11:48.070 --> 11:49.867
SMILEY FACE.

11:49.970 --> 11:53.098
- HMM. FUNNY THING.
BEGINNER'S LUCK, DETECTIVE.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.302
THIS MORNING,
ON THE WAY TO WORK,

11:54.410 --> 11:55.968
I HAD A V8,

11:56.080 --> 11:58.173
WHICH MAY ACCOUNT
FOR HOW SHARP I'VE BEEN.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.909
I'VE ALSO ACCOUNTED
FOR ALL 17 TRASH RECEPTACLES.

12:01.950 --> 12:02.109
EACH ONE HAS ITS LINER,

12:03.990 --> 12:07.915
EXCEPT ONE DOWN THE HALL
FROM THIS VERY OFFICE.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.783
AND HERE'S
THE INTERESTING THING.

12:09.890 --> 12:14.850
THE TRASH HAS NOT BEEN PICKED UP
FROM LAST NIGHT.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.029
- GET OUT.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.768
ARE YOU SURE YOUR TITLE

12:17.870 --> 12:19.895
ISN'T "CHIEF OF TRASH
RECEPTACLE LINERS"?

12:19.940 --> 12:20.099
- PERHAPS YOU'D ALL
LIKE TO JOIN ME IN THE HALLWAY.

12:21.940 --> 12:22.099
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
SALLY.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.069
WHERE THE HELL YOU GOING,
O'HARA?

12:28.180 --> 12:29.909
- GO.
[clears throat]

12:33.220 --> 12:35.279
- HERE, SODA DROPPED FROM
THE BOTTOM OF THE WASTE BAG.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.348
I BELIEVE THE KILLER
TOOK THIS ROUTE

12:37.450 --> 12:39.918
TO DISPOSE OF THE TRASH.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.009
[struggling]

12:41.120 --> 12:42.280
- THIS WAY!

12:42.390 --> 12:44.426
_ 1--
- FOLLOW ME, SHAWN.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.088
- THIS IS NARROW.

12:46.190 --> 12:47.953
- OKAY, HE WENT DOWN THE HALLWAY
THIS DIRECTION!

12:48.060 --> 12:49.357
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
SHAWN.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.769
SHAWN! GUS!
THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!

12:51.870 --> 12:53.497
YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO COME CLEAN
AND TURN YOURSELVES IN.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.033
both: SHH!

12:56.540 --> 12:58.098
YOU'RE A PART
OF THIS LIE TOO NOW.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.075
BESIDES, NONE OF US
KILLED THE GUY.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.772
- YOU STOLE THE MAN'S SOCKS!
WHAT KIND OF SICKOS DO THAT?

13:01.880 --> 13:03.279
- MR. SPENCER, YOUR HEART.
- GUSTER!

13:03.380 --> 13:05.007
I WILL CHOKE YOU OUT.
- DAD!

13:05.110 --> 13:07.442
- SPENCER, CALM DOWN.
- YEAH, SERIOUSLY, DAD.

13:07.550 --> 13:08.949
WHY DO YOU WANNA SOUND OFF
ALARM BELLS

13:09.050 --> 13:09.982
BEFORE GUS AND I HAVE
HAD A CHANCE

13:10.090 --> 13:11.944
TO INVESTIGATE THIS MURDER?

13:12.050 --> 13:13.415
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
THAT'S WHAT YOU USED TO DO.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.953
HAVE A LITTLE SPENCER FAITH.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.948
- YOU'RE FLOUNDERING,
SHAWN.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.482
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
A SUSPECT.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.196
- I FANTASIZE ABOUT KILLING
THAT MAN EVERY DAY.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.927
- OH, YES, WE DO.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.458
- THERE!

13:28.570 --> 13:32.165
THIS IS WHERE THE TRAIL ENDS,
AND OUR KILLER MADE HIS GETAWAY.

13:32.270 --> 13:36.172
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT.
THE KILLER GOT AWAY CLEAN.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.975
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.469
UNFORTUNATE, BUT IT'S OVER.
- [whistling]

13:40.580 --> 13:42.514
- NOBODY SHOULD BE WHISTLING
JUST YET.

13:42.620 --> 13:45.544
THIS WAY, FOLKS.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.950
IT'S JUST A THEORY.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.891
- THAT'S NOT THE DUMBEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.422
- WHAT KIND OF A PSYCHOPATH
STABS A MAN TO DEATH

13:55.530 --> 13:57.168
AND THEN DRINKS
A CUP OF COFFEE?

13:57.270 --> 14:03.266
[both grunting]

14:05.310 --> 14:08.279
- WITH ANY LUCK, THIS BAD BOY'LL
YIELD SOME PRINTS.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.075
- LET'S HAVE A LOOK,
SHALL WE?

14:11.610 --> 14:15.068
- WELL, LOOKEE THERE.

14:15.180 --> 14:16.317
IT'S COVERED WITH 'EM.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.342
- AND BOB'S YOUR UNCLE.

14:18.450 --> 14:20.418
- OH, DON'T TELL ME.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.523
- IT'S MY MUG.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.034
- NEIL NEBERSOL
IS OUT AS A SUSPECT.

14:36.140 --> 14:37.334
HE WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH HIS SHRINK

14:37.440 --> 14:38.509
WHEN CREECH WAS MURDERED.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.100
I VERIFIED IT.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.508
SQUARE ONE.
SHAWN!

14:42.610 --> 14:44.202
- I DON'T EVEN LIKE COFFEE.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.369
IT'S JUST A THING PEOPLE DO.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.619
"OH, I'LL PUT ON
A POT OF COFFEE."

14:48.720 --> 14:50.585
DAMN YOU, CAGNEY...

14:50.690 --> 14:52.009
AND LACEY.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.058
- A LOT OF ACID BUILD-UP
IN THE ESOPHAGEAL GLAND.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.628
EVIDENCE OF AGGRAVATED VOMITING
PRIOR TO DEATH.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.949
COULD BE FOUL PLAY,
OR HE COULD JUST BE BULIMIC.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.062
UH, THIS JUST IN.
I AM NOT BULIMIC.

15:03.170 --> 15:07.095
YESTERDAY, I ATE A DONUT
OUT OF THE GARBAGE.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.497
- HUH.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.965
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF VOMIT
AT THE SCENE.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.561
THE KILLER MUST'VE
CLEANED THAT UP AS WELL.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.002
- THAT LINER IS MISSING.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.977
- WOUNDS ARE DEEP,
BUT THEY'RE NARROW, SMOOTH.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.071
I'M THINKING MAYBE
AN ICE PICK AT THIS POINT.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.978
- AND I DON'T OPEN MY OWN MAIL.
YOU DO!

15:23.090 --> 15:25.183
- CREECH!
THAT IS ENOUGH!

15:25.290 --> 15:26.951
- NOT ME.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.654
I'M THINKING
IT'S A LETTER OPENER.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.298
- YES. HELEN BLAINE,
CREECH'S ASSISTANT.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.994
HE THREW A LETTER OPENER
AT HER YESTERDAY MORNING.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.089
- NOW THAT'S SOMETHING
TO GO ON.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.622
I'LL CHECK OUT THIS BLAINE.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.960
O'HARA, GET THAT MUG
DOWN TO FORENSICS ASAP.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.059
- UH, ASAP FEELS
A LITTLE ZEALOUS.

15:42.170 --> 15:44.035
SOONISH WOULD SUFFICE.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.563
JULES.
JULES, JULES.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.070
NOW THAT WE'RE BACK
IN THE SADDLE

15:49.180 --> 15:50.408
AT YE OLD HOMESTEAD--

15:50.510 --> 15:52.273
- SHAWN,
IT'S STILL MY HOMESTEAD,

15:52.380 --> 15:54.109
AND NOTHING IS BACK YET.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.108
LAST NIGHT WAS ONE-TIME THING.
WE'RE ADULTS.

15:56.220 --> 15:57.141
- RIGHT.
- IT HAPPENS.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.444
- RIGHT.

15:58.550 --> 16:00.256
WE CAN WORK OUT
THE LOGISTICS LATER.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.952
REMEMBER THAT LITTLE TALK
WE HAD ABOUT HONESTY?

16:02.060 --> 16:03.357
- LITTLE?

16:03.460 --> 16:07.021
- WELL, HONEST SHAWN HAS
SOMETHING TINY TO DISCLOSE.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.950
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING?

16:09.060 --> 16:10.596
- GUS PANICKED.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.565
- I ACTED LIKE A NORMAL PERSON
IN A HIGHLY CHARGED SITUATION.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.399
- MAN, YOU ATE A BUCK SLIP.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.606
- I WILL NOT LIE FOR YOU, SHAWN.
I CAN'T BE A PART OF THIS.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.029
- NO, I'M SORRY.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.334
I'M SORRY, JULES.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.976
THE MUG IN THE BAG
IS THE MUG FROM THE HOUSE,

16:22.080 --> 16:23.968
WHICH MEANS YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER IT TOO.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.048
- YOU TOOK OUR MUG
TO A MURDER?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.175
- DAMN YOU, TYNE DALY...

16:28.280 --> 16:29.679
AND SHARON GLESS.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.179
- WELL, MY FINGERPRINTS
WON'T BE ON IT

16:31.290 --> 16:32.382
IF YOU DID THE DISHES
LIKE YOU SAID YOU DID.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.650
- ANOTHER MOMENT OF HONESTY?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.113
- I HEARD THE DISHWASHER
RUNNING!

16:35.220 --> 16:36.357
- IT WAS EMPTY, OKAY?
I RAN IT EMPTY.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.155
- WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?
- LOOK.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.989
I DON'T NEED YOU TO LIE.
I JUST NEED YOU TO DELAY.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.694
ALL RIGHT? FORENSICS GOES
TO LUNCH IN TEN MINUTES.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.324
SO IF YOU WAIT 12 MINUTES
TO DROP THAT OFF,

16:44.430 --> 16:45.988
THEN THEY WON'T GET TO IT
TILL AFTER LUNCH.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.738
WHICH MEANS GUS AND I
WILL HAVE TIME TO NAB A SUSPECT.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.330
- YOU HAVE TO STOP LOOPING ME
INTO THIS STUFF.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.237
I AM NOT GOOD
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

16:51.340 --> 16:56.232
- HOW IS IT THAT I'M NOW
BEING PUNISHED FOR BEING HONEST?

16:58.180 --> 16:59.408
- [gaSPSJ

17:00.850 --> 17:02.112
- HELLO, O'HARA.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.142
LAY OFF THE COFFEE.
- COFFEE? WHAT?

17:04.250 --> 17:05.740
I HAVEN'T HAD COFFEE
IN, LIKE, 28 HOURS.

17:05.790 --> 17:06.142
29 HOURS.
28 HOURS.

17:07.790 --> 17:08.154
- OKAY.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.078
SO SALLY THE SECURITY GUARD
CAME BY APPARENTLY TO SEE

17:12.190 --> 17:13.726
WHAT A BIG BOY POLICE STATION
LOOKS LIKE

17:13.830 --> 17:15.252
AND TO TELL US
WE MAY STILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER

17:15.360 --> 17:17.123
SOME IMAGES OFF THE DAMAGED
HARD DRIVE

17:17.230 --> 17:18.788
FROM THE SECURITY CAMERAS
OUTSIDE CREECH'S OFFICE.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.164
SO...STAY TUNED.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.104
- THE KILLER DESTROYED
THE HARD DRIVE.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.472
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.138
- GUS, THIS ISN'T A GREAT THING.
- WHY NOT?

17:31.250 --> 17:33.115
- BECAUSE THE KILLER
WOULD'VE BEEN ON CAMERA

17:33.220 --> 17:34.573
BREAKING
INTO CREECH'S OFFICE,

17:34.680 --> 17:36.113
AND THEN WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT NOW.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.778
- YES, BUT I WOULD BE
ON THERE TOO, SHAWN.

17:37.890 --> 17:42.088
- YES, BUT YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.181
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM,
DID YOU?

17:44.290 --> 17:46.281
- I CANNOT DO THIS WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW.

17:46.390 --> 17:47.618
- DO WHAT?

17:47.730 --> 17:49.527
IF YOU KILLED HIM,
JUST TELL ME.

17:55.270 --> 17:57.135
- I CAN'T DO IT, SHAWN.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.060
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I'M A MURDERER.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.707
- OKAY.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.346
THAT'S IT.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.099
YOU HAVE TO PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.575
WE HAVE TO FIND HELEN
BEFORE LASSITER DOES.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.147
NOW TIGHTEN IT UP!
- I CAN'T.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.740
- WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.340
AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
A JOB TO DO.

18:11.450 --> 18:12.849
- I QUIT YESTERDAY, REMEMBER?

18:12.950 --> 18:15.510
- THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THAT
IS DEAD AS A DONUT HOLE.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.224
NOW TIGHTEN IT UP!

18:17.330 --> 18:19.855
- FINE.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.521
- AH, BURTON GUSTER.
JUST THE PERSON I WANTED TO SEE.

18:23.630 --> 18:24.562
- REALLY?

18:24.600 --> 18:25.191
- THIS IS MR. MURRAY,
SVP FROM CORPORATE.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.792
FLEW IN FROM SACRAMENTO
HEADQUARTERS THIS MORNING

18:28.900 --> 18:31.664
TO ATTEND THE IN-OFFICE
MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR CREECH.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.806
- MR. MURRAY,
IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.730
YOU ARE ONE
OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS,

18:35.840 --> 18:37.148
YOU'RE A LEGEND AROUND HERE.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.808
- WHO CARES WHAT YOU THINK?
- WHAT?

18:38.910 --> 18:40.138
- I'M KIDDING.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.139
- [chuckling]

18:43.250 --> 18:44.808
UH, WHAT IS THIS?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.410
- THAT'S A SCRATCH-N-SNIFF
STICKER. ENJOY IT.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.714
BURTON GUSTER.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.481
I RECOGNIZE THE NAME

18:49.590 --> 18:51.683
BUT DIDN'T THINK
YOU WORKED HERE ANYMORE.

18:51.790 --> 18:54.350
- OH, YEAH, I REPRESENT
THE ENTIRE LINE OF ALOVATICINE.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.155
- AH, YES.
MAKES SENSE.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.366
YOU'RE THE PERFECT GUY
FOR SCROTAL INFLAMMATION CREAMS.

18:59.470 --> 19:00.789
- OH.
WHY IS THAT?

19:00.840 --> 19:01.192
- KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

19:04.270 --> 19:05.908
- I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

19:06.010 --> 19:07.238
- I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

19:07.340 --> 19:08.739
I AM A SINGLES CHAMPION
OF HOPSCOTCH.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.240
I ALSO USE ALOVATICINE
ALL THE TIME.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.476
- SO YOU DON'T WORK HERE.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.774
DO YOU HAVE A PASS?
DID YOU SIGN IN?

19:13.880 --> 19:15.211
HIT THE BRICKS, PAL.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.413
- OH, NO, NO.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.408
AND HE'S WHITE.
- I'M WHITE.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.818
- TODAY WAS "BRING YOUR WHITE
BEST FRIEND TO WORK" DAY.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.251
DID YOU NOT GET THE MEMO?

19:23.360 --> 19:24.918
- I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.759
AND EVEN IF I DID, I DON'T HAVE
A WHITE BEST FRIEND.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.157
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

19:28.260 --> 19:31.229
- THOUGH I AM AN AVID CAMPER.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.888
I'M SORRY, GUSTER.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.888
I NEED YOU TO COPY
THIS SENTENCE THREE TIMES.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.592
I'M SENDING OFF
A HANDWRITING SAMPLE

19:36.700 --> 19:38.406
FROM EVERYBODY
IN THE COMPANY

19:38.510 --> 19:40.569
TO BE MATCHED AGAINST THE NOTE
LEFT IN CREECH'S HAND.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.899
- OH! THAT'S
IN YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION?

19:44.010 --> 19:46.808
- FRONT AND CENTER, PLEASE,
GUSTER.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.343
I STRONGLY SUSPECT
THAT WHOEVER WROTE THAT NOTE

19:48.450 --> 19:49.940
IS INVOLVED IN THE MURDER.

19:50.050 --> 19:51.586
- OH, MY GOSH.
- THAT'S A SHAME.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.918
WE'LL HAVE TO--

19:53.020 --> 19:54.317
- JUST "A-B-C, A-B-C, A-B-C"
PLEASE.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.887
CAN'T BE THAT HARD.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.823
I DON'T WANNA MISS
THE MEMORIAL SERVICE.

19:58.930 --> 20:03.560
- DORIAN CREECH'S UNTIMELY DEATH
IS A TRAGEDY

20:03.670 --> 20:07.231
AND NOT BECAUSE HE WAS
A GOOD HUMAN BEING.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.762
WHO CARES ABOUT THAT PART?

20:08.870 --> 20:11.964
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS ONE
OF THE BEST SALESMEN

20:12.070 --> 20:13.731
OF HIS GENERATION.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.478
- WHERE IS HELEN BLAINE'S DESK?
TAKE ME TO IT.

20:15.580 --> 20:18.504
- FOLLOW ME.
- THE SWEET MUSIC OF SUCCESS.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.613
YOU ALL DESERVE SCRATCH-N-SNIFFS
AND SHOULD BE SNIFFING

20:21.720 --> 20:22.948
TO YOUR HEART'S DELIGHT.
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.813
- WELL, WHAT TIME
DOES SHE USUALLY ROLL IN?

20:24.920 --> 20:27.252
- SHE'S NEVER LATE.
- WHERE DO YOU THINK SHE IS?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.987
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- WE GOTTA FIND OUT.

20:29.090 --> 20:31.581
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
- WE'RE UP IN PHOENIX.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.227
WE'RE UP IN LOUISVILLE.
WE'RE UP IN SIOUX CITY.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.855
SO WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO
IS TO MOVE FORWARD

20:36.960 --> 20:39.827
AND CONTINUE TO PROSPER.

20:39.930 --> 20:42.728
WE'LL DO IT FOR CREECH.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.308
"D," DECEASED.
"R," RECOVERY.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.935
"O", OPPORTUNITY.
"S". I I

20:48.040 --> 20:49.405
SMILE.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.774
- DR. OS?

20:51.880 --> 20:53.313
- DORIAN CREECH IS DEAD.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.842
HE'S GONE,
HE'S NOT COMING BACK.

20:54.950 --> 20:57.441
PAINFUL,
BUT IT'S A FACT.

20:57.550 --> 21:00.986
THIS COMPANY NEEDS
A NEW LEADER.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.354
IS IT GONNA BE YOU?
YOU?

21:03.460 --> 21:05.257
YOU?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.521
I KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA BE YOU.

21:07.630 --> 21:08.995
AND SMILE.

21:09.100 --> 21:13.764
SO WHEN YOURSELF
GETTING THE SAD AND GLOOMIES,

21:13.870 --> 21:17.465
SELL YOURSELF A SMILE.

21:17.570 --> 21:19.834
- I'LL SELL YOU A SMILE.
- SUCK IT, SHAWN.

21:19.940 --> 21:23.398
- NOW, WOULD ANYONE ELSE
LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS?

21:23.510 --> 21:26.479
- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SAY--
- SHH.

21:26.580 --> 21:27.979
- MR. FINCH.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.887
- NEIL.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.514
WHERE'S HELEN?

21:33.620 --> 21:35.850
- CALLED IN SICK.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.848
I SHOULD'VE DONE THE SAME.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.928
I CAN'T WATCH FINCH
GO MUCH FURTHER DOWN THIS ROAD.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.998
- OH, THAT'S CONVENIENT.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.568
KILL YOUR BOSS,
AND THEN CALL IN SICK.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.867
- * SITTING IN MY CUBICLE

21:47.970 --> 21:51.565
* THE CLOCK TICKS,
AND I THINK OF YOU *

21:51.670 --> 21:56.937
* I TRIED TO MAKE PLANS,
YOU POSTPONED *

21:57.040 --> 21:59.406
* NOW YOU'RE DEAD

21:59.510 --> 22:00.943
* PROJECTS ON OUR TIME

22:01.050 --> 22:02.870
- YOU THINK HELEN'S
REALLY SICK?

22:02.980 --> 22:04.914
- NOT AT ALL.
- * LEFT BEHIND

22:05.020 --> 22:07.386
- WE FIND HELEN,
WE FIND OUR KILLER.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.913
- * YOU LEFT
WITHOUT A SIGN *

22:10.020 --> 22:13.820
* YOUR R.R.S.P.s
ARE NOW R.I.P.s *

22:13.930 --> 22:16.649
* ALL OUT OF TIME

22:16.760 --> 22:20.764
* I JUST CUT YOU AN EXTRA SET
OF MY KEYS *

22:20.870 --> 22:22.633
* NOW THERE'S NO TIME

22:22.740 --> 22:24.401
[phone vibrating]
* YOU PROMISED

22:24.510 --> 22:26.899
- SPENCER FOR HIRE.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.102
WOODY!

22:28.210 --> 22:29.734
- I THINK YOU BOYS
SHOULD GET DOWN HERE

22:29.840 --> 22:31.774
RIGHT AWAY.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.976
- * NEVER TOLD YOU, BUT YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE CHRIS KLEIN *

22:36.080 --> 22:38.685
* YOU WERE SUBLIME

22:40.960 --> 22:42.780
- LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE STORY.

22:42.890 --> 22:46.485
AS I WAS DOING MY STANDARD
INVENTORY OF THE BODY--

22:46.590 --> 22:49.024
STOMACH CONTENTS,
WOUND ANALYSIS, SNIFF TEST.

22:49.130 --> 22:50.961
- OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE THE SNIFF
TEST HAD BECOME STANDARD.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.766
- THE BODY HAD
A DISTINCT AROMA,

22:53.870 --> 22:56.065
ONE THAT IS QUITE FAMILIAR
TO ME.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.900
IT WAS THE SCENT
OF COCOA BUTTER.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.568
- TSK!

23:00.680 --> 23:02.500
- MAN, YOU KNOW SWEAT ACT IVATES
MY LOTION.

23:02.610 --> 23:03.872
- WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU?
YOU GO AROUND SMELLING

23:03.980 --> 23:05.845
LIKE A VACATION,
IT'S GONNA COME BACK TO BITE US.

23:05.880 --> 23:06.039
- NOT SO FAST, SHAWN!

23:07.850 --> 23:09.374
I ALSO SMELLED A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF AXE BODY SPRAY.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.981
- NO.
- INSTINCTI BELIEVE.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.580
- I DON'T THINK SO.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.658
- HOW BADLY DID YOU TWO
MANHANDLE THIS GUY?

23:14.760 --> 23:15.852
- A--UH--

23:15.890 --> 23:16.049
- ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN TO ME, WOODY.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.858
WE MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE RUN-IN
WITH THE BODY.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.154
- OH!
- POST-DEATH.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.921
POST- DEATH.

23:22.030 --> 23:24.021
GUS ATE SOMETHING
THAT WAS IN HIS HAND,

23:24.130 --> 23:25.563
AND I STOLE HIS SOCKS.

23:25.670 --> 23:26.967
LOOK, IT'S A LONG STORY,

23:27.070 --> 23:28.162
BUT WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU
RIGHT NOW

23:28.270 --> 23:30.397
IS MAN-DISCRETION.
- SHH.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.909
- JUST SIT ON THIS INFO
UNTIL WE CAN MAKE

23:32.010 --> 23:33.705
SOME REAL PROGRESS
IN THIS CASE.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.903
- FELLAS...

23:36.010 --> 23:37.546
WE'RE BROTHERS.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.901
THERE ISN'T MUCH
I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU.

23:39.010 --> 23:42.116
I AM A VAULT
OF SECRECY.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.188
- THANKS, MAN.
- I WILL TELL NO ONE.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.417
- BROTHERS
FROM ANOTHER MOTHER.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.488
- THANK YOU.

23:48.590 --> 23:52.128
- OH, ONE LAST THING, FELLAS.
I CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.698
I WILL TELL EVERYONE!
ANYONE!

23:54.800 --> 23:56.051
I WAS ALREADY REACHING
FOR MY PHONE

23:56.160 --> 23:58.492
TO CALL SOMEONE.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.036
- WOODY, YOU'RE CALLING ME.
- DON'T PICK UP.

24:06.810 --> 24:10.871
[phone vibrating]

24:10.980 --> 24:13.175
- [clears throat]
HI, JULES.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.941
- OKAY, I JUST DROPPED OFF
THE MUG TO FORENSICS.

24:15.050 --> 24:16.870
YOU'VE GOT 2.5 HOURS.

24:16.980 --> 24:17.878
PLEASE TELL ME THINGS HAVEN'T
GOTTEN FURTHER OUT OF CONTROL.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.844
- THEY HAVE NOT.

24:19.890 --> 24:20.049
- ARE YOU BEING HONEST?

24:26.630 --> 24:28.029
- NOPE.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.999
- SHAWN, HAVE YOU GUYS
LOST YOUR MINDS?

24:32.100 --> 24:33.192
- YES, MEANING WE'LL NEED
TO FIND THEM.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.995
MINE IS GIGANTAUR
AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH,

24:35.100 --> 24:36.658
LIKE A CHIA PET HEAD.

24:36.770 --> 24:37.702
GUS' LOOKS LIKE
A KIDNEY BEAN.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.708
-AH!

24:38.810 --> 24:40.004
- MAHALO, JULIET.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.475
- MY GOD, WOODY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:41.580 --> 24:42.979
- HAPPIER THAN A SWINE
IN POO.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.809
BY THE WAY,
THIS WAS ALL MY IDEA.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.878
I CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.174
- OKAY,
THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.817
YOU HAVE TIED THE CORONER
TO THE COUCH.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.012
YOU GUYS DO REALIZE HOW INSANE
THIS IS, RIGHT?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.678
- YES.

24:53.790 --> 24:54.882
- YOU CALL IT INSANE,
WE CALL IT TUESDAY.

24:54.990 --> 24:55.957
- IT'S THURSDAY.
- IS IT REALLY?

24:56.060 --> 24:57.482
- IT'S FINE, J, GIRL.

24:57.590 --> 24:58.955
I GOT EVERYTHING I NEED
AND MORE.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.152
- WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?

25:00.260 --> 25:02.148
WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM?

25:02.260 --> 25:06.162
- ALL COVERED, A LITTLE
SOMETHING I CAN DEPEND ON.

25:06.270 --> 25:07.862
- HE'S WEARING DIAPERS?

25:07.900 --> 25:08.059
- YES, JULIET, HE IS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:10.340 --> 25:12.604
I THINK JACK BAUER ALSO WORE
ADULT DIAPERS.

25:12.710 --> 25:13.972
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HIM
NOT GOING TO HE CANSKI

25:14.080 --> 25:15.274
FOR WHAT, EIGHT YEARS?

25:15.380 --> 25:17.974
- GUS, A SNACK PERHAPS?
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

25:18.080 --> 25:20.173
- OOH!
UH, SERRANO HAM ON RYE,

25:20.280 --> 25:22.077
TOUCH OF WHOLE GRAIN MUSTARD,
AND A SLICE OF QUESO--

25:22.180 --> 25:24.045
ANYTHING DOMESTIC.
SURPRISE ME.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.516
- WE HAVE CHEESE TRUMPETS.
- THAT'LL DO.

25:26.620 --> 25:29.783
WOULD YOU BE A DOLL
AND GENTLY FEED ME?

25:29.890 --> 25:31.755
THANKS, FRIEND.
- OKAY, THIS IS TOO MUCH.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.179
ALL RIGHT?
I'M GONNA SET WOODY FREE.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.190
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO,
END OF STORY.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.858
- JULES,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.518
- I KNOW YOU'RE KNEE-DEEP
IN THIS, JULIET.

25:38.630 --> 25:41.929
I'LL SING LIKE A BIRD
TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.861
[phone ringing]

25:44.910 --> 25:45.069
- HEY, CARLTON.

25:47.810 --> 25:50.199
SOUNDS GOOD.
OKAY.

25:50.310 --> 25:53.939
WHERE AM I?
UM, I'M--

25:54.050 --> 25:55.938
- ROB LOWE'S HOUSE.
- COLOR ME MINE.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.119
- ANY CAVE.

25:57.220 --> 26:00.314
- I'M AT THE-THE...
LADY DOCTOR

26:00.420 --> 26:03.821
FOR TH E--
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.079
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.021
DANG IT, SHAWN!
I JUST LIED TO MY PARTNER.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.290
- YOU SAID LADY DOCTOR.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.664
- WELL, I PANICKED.
I GOT ALL FLUSTERED.

26:10.770 --> 26:11.964
I HAVE TO GO MEET HIM
AT THE STATION.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.298
HE WAS JUST
AT HELEN'S HOUSE.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.936
SHE'S NOT THERE,
BUT A NEIGHBOR SAW HER LEAVING

26:15.040 --> 26:16.792
IN SOME WORK-OUT CLOTHES,
WHICH IS WEIRD

26:16.900 --> 26:18.060
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE A GYM
MEMBERSHIP ANWVHERE IN THE CITY,

26:18.170 --> 26:19.933
SO WE'RE GONNA EXPEDITE
A SEARCH WARRANT.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.304
[exaggerated sigh]

26:31.750 --> 26:34.150
- OOH! I THINK I KNOW
WHERE HELEN MIGHT BE.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.290
- FIRST OF ALL, HELEN,
GOOD MORNING.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.958
- MY GOD, YOU SCARED ME.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.322
- WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID,

26:44.430 --> 26:46.921
SO DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND STOP RUNNING.

26:47.030 --> 26:48.839
SERIOUSLY, I MEAN,
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.589
STOP RUNNING!
- WE GET IT, OKAY?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.337
YOU CAN RUN.
YOU'RE A RUNNER.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.998
BUT WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO RIGHT NOW

26:54.110 --> 26:56.977
IS STOP AND TUY'EU YOURSELF IN.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.298
- OKAY!
I ADMIT IT.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.140
I HATED CREECH SO MUCH,

27:02.250 --> 27:06.846
SO I PUT EYE DROPS
IN HIS COFFEE, OKAY?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.019
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.951
- THAT'S WHY CREECH
WAS THROWING UP.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.381
- BUT WHEN I RETURNED LATER THAT
NIGHT TO PICK UP SOME FILES,

27:12.490 --> 27:15.891
I FOUND HIM LAYING
ON THE FLOOR, DEAD.

27:15.930 --> 27:16.089
I HAD NO IDEA THE EYE DROPS
WOULD KILL HIM.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.768
I PANICKED.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.064
- HELEN, WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE

27:20.170 --> 27:23.059
WERE THE STAB WOUNDS
ON CREECH'S BACK.

27:23.170 --> 27:26.059
YOU DIDN'T KILL YOUR BOSS.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.331
- I REALLY DIDN'T KILL
THE SON OF A BITCH?

27:28.440 --> 27:30.908
- NO! NOW CAN WE PLEASE
STOP RUNNING?

27:31.010 --> 27:34.912
- NO WAY! I'M SO HAPPY, I FEEL
LIKE I CAN RUN FOREVER!

27:35.020 --> 27:37.944
- DON'T YOU SAY THAT!
DON'T YOU SAY THAT!

27:38.050 --> 27:41.986
- OKAY. OKAY, HELEN.
YOU WERE CREECH'S ASSISTANT,

27:42.090 --> 27:44.058
SO YOU MUST KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYBODY

27:44.160 --> 27:45.889
WHO MIGHT'VE HAD IT OUT
FOR HIM.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.891
- HOW ABOUT EVERYONE
ON THE SALES TEAM?

27:48.930 --> 27:49.089
YOURSELF INCLUDED.
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

27:51.130 --> 27:55.066
- I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
HIS JOB PAID A MILLION BUCKS.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.058
- A MILLION?
- BUT CORPORATE LOVED HIM.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.762
HE WAS A STAR.

27:58.870 --> 28:01.236
- THAT'S IT, GUS.
A MILLION BUCKS.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.843
WHOEVER KILLED HIM
MUST'VE BEEN

28:03.950 --> 28:05.099
THE ONE WHO WAS NEXT IN LINE
FOR HIS JOB.

28:05.210 --> 28:06.302
- YEAH.
- [pained yell]

28:06.410 --> 28:08.947
- OKAY.
- [pained yell]

28:09.050 --> 28:10.244
- OH, GREAT, SO...

28:10.350 --> 28:13.410
HELEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.953
OKAY.

28:18.090 --> 28:20.126
I SAID IT ONCE, SHAWN,
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.994
I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
BEING HERE RIGHT NOW.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.829
- WOULD YOU RELAX?

28:24.930 --> 28:26.067
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO'S NEXT IN LINE

28:26.170 --> 28:27.797
FOR CREECH'S MAC DADDY JOB

28:27.900 --> 28:29.458
AND HOPEFULLY GET HIM
TO FESS UP RIGHT NOW.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.231
- WELL, WE BETTER DO IT QUICK.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.898
BECAUSE I CAN TELL
I'M ALREADY GUILTY

28:32.940 --> 28:33.099
IN EVERYONE'S EYES.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.930
YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

28:36.040 --> 28:37.302
BEFORE SALLY GETS
THE HANDWRITING RESULTS BACK,

28:37.410 --> 28:38.775
AND THEN I'M DONE, SHAWN.
DONE!

28:38.880 --> 28:39.972
- DUDE, YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.479
HE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE
THOSE RESULTS.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.048
- MR. GUSTER.

28:44.150 --> 28:45.708
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN
MR. SALLY AND MYSELF

28:45.820 --> 28:49.711
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM?

28:50.490 --> 28:52.981
MR. GUSTER, PLEASE.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.924
SALLY HERE HAS UNCOVERED
THE DETAILS

28:58.030 --> 29:02.160
OF A PUBLIC CONFRONTATION YOU
HAD WITH MR. CREECH YESTERDAY.

29:02.270 --> 29:04.204
- [chuckling]

29:04.310 --> 29:06.039
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL IT
A CONFRONTATION.

29:06.140 --> 29:07.164
- OH, NO?
- NO.

29:07.270 --> 29:08.931
- YOU TOLD HIM,
AND I QUOTE,

29:09.040 --> 29:11.372
"SAY HELLO TO BEELZEBUB
AFTER YOU FLY FIRST CLASS

29:11.480 --> 29:14.847
"TO THE FIRE PITS OF HELL,
YOU BLACK-HEARTED,

29:14.950 --> 29:16.918
BABY GIRL BASTARD."

29:16.950 --> 29:17.109
- I DON'T THINK
THOSE WERE MY EXACT WORDS.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.986
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
IS EVIDENCE OF, MR. GUSTER?

29:22.090 --> 29:27.084
THIS IS EVIDENCE OF A MAN
WITH BRASS STONES.

29:27.190 --> 29:28.498
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.919
- YOU'RE FEARLESS, GUSTER.

29:29.960 --> 29:30.119
- I DON'T THINK
I'M FOLLOWING YOU.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.219
- YOU STAND UP
TO AUTHORITY FIGURES,

29:33.330 --> 29:34.934
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

29:35.040 --> 29:36.234
IN A NEW LEADER.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.160
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.033
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

29:40.140 --> 29:43.530
- YOU'RE THE NEW VICE PRESIDENT
OF THIS BRANCH OF CENTRAL COAST.

29:43.640 --> 29:46.347
- SON OF A BITCH.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.338
- WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.940
- [laughs]
SON OF A--

29:50.050 --> 29:52.883
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA SHAKE.
- OH.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.355
- OKAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH TOUCHING.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.021
NOW, GUSTER, YOU'RE A MAN
OF POWER HERE NOW.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.927
- OKAY.
- THAT HAVING BEEN SAID,

30:00.030 --> 30:03.249
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO TIGHTEN IT UP.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.089
- TIGHTEN WHAT UP?
- TIGHTEN YOURSELF UP.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.327
MAKE YOURSELF SING, GUSTER,

30:07.430 --> 30:10.092
AND I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE NAUGHTY OPERA.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.337
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.101
- IT MEANS

30:13.210 --> 30:15.075
GO LIVE THE "YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF ME" DREAM.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.238
SALLY?
ANYTHING TO ADD?

30:16.340 --> 30:18.149
- YES, I DO.
[clears throat]

30:18.250 --> 30:20.912
MR. GUSTER, NOW THAT YOU'RE
CALLING THE SHOTS AROUND HERE,

30:20.950 --> 30:21.109
I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE

30:22.350 --> 30:23.942
OUR TOP PRIORITY
SHOULD STILL BE

30:24.050 --> 30:26.189
FIGURING OUT
WHO KILLED MR. CREECH.

30:26.290 --> 30:31.023
- OH, YEAH.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.928
THAT'S THE--OOH!
THAT'S THE TIPPY TOP.

30:33.960 --> 30:34.119
- I'M CLOSING IN
ON THE CULPRIT.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.029
- REALLY?
- YES.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.563
THE HANDWRITING EXPERTS
HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.195
- NO.
- OBVIOUSLY YOU...

30:41.300 --> 30:43.439
WILL BE...

30:43.540 --> 30:46.202
EXCLUDED.
- [chuckling]

30:46.310 --> 30:48.073
OF COURSE HE'LL BE EXCLUDED.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, SALLY.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.272
- YOU'RE NOT PART OF THIS.
- YOU'RE THE BOSS!

30:49.380 --> 30:50.938
HE CAN MURDER
ANYBODY HE WANTS!

30:51.050 --> 30:52.608
- AH!
- YEAH! ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

30:52.710 --> 30:54.177
HEY, YOU'RE FUNNY.
- YOU HAVE A PENCIL?

30:54.280 --> 30:55.975
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- I ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION...

30:56.080 --> 30:56.876
- WHAT'S THAT?

30:56.980 --> 30:58.584
- THE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE
HARD DRIVES

30:58.690 --> 31:00.009
ARE IN THE FINAL STAGES
OF DATA RECOVERY.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.610
SOON, WE'LL HAVE AN IMAGE

31:01.720 --> 31:03.927
OF WHOEVER WAS COMING AND GOING
AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER.

31:03.960 --> 31:04.119
- OH.
OKAY.

31:09.030 --> 31:12.397
- NICE WORK, SALLY.
THANK YOU.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.469
THAT'S A SCRATCH-N-SNIFF
STICKER FOR YOU.

31:15.570 --> 31:17.037
- CONGRATULATIONS.

31:17.140 --> 31:20.268
- GO LEAD THE TROOPS,
BOSS MAN.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.270
HEY, GUSTER,
ONE MORE THING.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.940
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOSE
THAT ALMOND COCOA BUTTER LOTION

31:25.050 --> 31:26.176
YOU'RE SPORTING.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.475
FRAN KLY,
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.912
YOU SMELL
LIKE A JERK.

31:34.990 --> 31:39.120
GO AHEAD.
SCRATCH, SNIFF IT.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.925
- BANANAS.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.089
- BINGO.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.224
- I'M HAVING A MELTDOWN.

31:44.330 --> 31:45.592
- YOU SHOULD BE HAVING
A MELTDOWN.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.962
- WELL, I AM.
- GOOD!

31:47.070 --> 31:48.492
- SHAWN.
- ALL RIGHT, RELAX.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.295
I'M STILL PROUD OF YOU.
- YOU ARE?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.038
- UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT THING

31:52.140 --> 31:56.099
FOR BOTH OF US.
- MOSTLY FOR ME.

31:56.210 --> 31:59.543
SALLY'S MOVING IN FAST.
WE NEED TO FIND THAT KILLER NOW.

32:04.620 --> 32:09.319
- GUS, FOLLOW ME.

32:09.420 --> 32:14.028
- STUPID GUSTER AND HIS STUPID,
PERFECT, HANDSOME FACE

32:14.130 --> 32:17.054
AND HIS BEAUTIFUL
MOCHACCINO SKIN,

32:17.160 --> 32:19.594
TEETH THAT LOOK LIKE
THEY CAME FROM ATLANTIS.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.691
WHAT DOES SOMEONE EVEN EAT
TO LOOK LIKE THAT?

32:21.800 --> 32:24.701
- FINCHY MAY BE OUR MURDERER.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.368
I ALSO THINK
HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

32:26.470 --> 32:29.928
- HE IS NOT IN LOVE WITH ME,
SHAWN.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.142
- THIS IS GOOD.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.547
THESE PRINTS
ARE GONNA GIVE US OUR KILLER,

32:38.650 --> 32:40.208
TIE THIS CASE UP
IN A NEAT LITTLE MURDER BOW.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.651
- OH, YEAH.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.011
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST SO SATISFYING

32:43.120 --> 32:45.054
MATCHING PRINTS TO...
MURDERERS.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.048
OH!

32:47.160 --> 32:48.525
- WHAT THE HELL?
YOU OKAY?

32:48.630 --> 32:54.262
- NO. NO, YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING
NAUSEOUS AND CRAMPY

32:54.370 --> 32:56.668
AND--
- LADY DOCTOR.

32:56.770 --> 32:58.101
- YEAH.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.962
- OH, DEAR GOD.

33:00.070 --> 33:03.107
O'HARA,
YOU CAN TELL ME.

33:03.210 --> 33:08.147
ARE YOU CARRYING
SPENCER'S UNBORN DEMON SEED?

33:10.150 --> 33:12.641
OH.
CRAP!

33:12.750 --> 33:15.753
- GUSTER AND HIS PERFECT
ATHLETIC BUILD.

33:15.790 --> 33:16.154
THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM
THE JOB.

33:17.690 --> 33:20.079
MAKES SENSE I WOULD--
I WOULD GIVE HIM THE JOB.

33:20.190 --> 33:23.125
BUT HE COULD GET ANY JOB!
WHY DOES HE WANT MY JOB?

33:23.230 --> 33:24.458
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S GOT
PERFECT TEETH.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.765
- MAN, FINCH IS IN LOVE
WITH ME.

33:26.870 --> 33:29.088
- NOPE. I AM NOT GONNA LET
YOU DATE A SMOKER.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.428
- I'M NOT GONNA DATE HIM,
SHAWN.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.429
[phone vibrating]

33:33.540 --> 33:35.405
- HEY, JULES.

33:35.510 --> 33:38.741
OKAY.
THAT'S NOT GREAT.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.101
WEIRD.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.144
SUPER WEIRD.
OKAY, BYE.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.081
WE ARE OUT OF TIME.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.112
LASSIE'S ABOUT TO THE HAVE
THE PRINT RESULTS.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.539
JULES IS TRYING TO STALL HIM

33:47.650 --> 33:48.753
BY PRETENDING TO BE CARRYING
STARFISH SPENCER.

33:48.790 --> 33:49.154
- STARFISH WHO?

33:50.260 --> 33:51.750
- MY FIRSTBORN, STARFISH,

33:51.860 --> 33:54.124
NAMED AFTER THE GRACEFUL
AND STYLISH SEA CREATURE.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.790
- OH. I LIKE.
I LIKE IT A LOT.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.492
- THANK YOU.
[door shuts]

34:01.370 --> 34:02.792
MAN, YOUR BOYFRIEND
IS GONE!

34:02.900 --> 34:05.460
- HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND,
SHAWN.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.801
- WHAT?

34:08.910 --> 34:10.036
WHERE DID HE GO?

34:10.140 --> 34:12.108
- WHAT THE--?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.246
- MAN.

34:15.350 --> 34:17.341
I DON'T WANNA RUN ANYMORE!

34:17.450 --> 34:21.352
- HELLO, GENTLEMEN.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.815
- UH, HEY, SALLY.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

34:23.920 --> 34:25.785
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

34:25.890 --> 34:28.450
- WOW.

34:28.560 --> 34:32.098
JUST FOR POOPS AND GIGGLES,
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT?

34:32.200 --> 34:34.634
- I DID A HYPOTHETICAL
EVIDENCE DISPOSAL ROUTE

34:34.740 --> 34:37.061
BASED ON THE CRIMINAL PROFILE
I'D ESTABLISHED

34:37.170 --> 34:39.104
FOR THE PERPETRATORS
OF THE CRIME,

34:39.210 --> 34:40.404
WHICH LED ME TO T.J.MAXX,

34:40.510 --> 34:43.399
WHERE I BOUGHT THESE BOOTS.

34:43.510 --> 34:45.239
- PRICED COM PETITIVELY.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.739
- THEN I WENT
TO THE DUMPSTER

34:47.850 --> 34:50.410
BEHIND CALAMITY JUAN'S
MEXICAN CAFE.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.078
RING A BELL?

35:02.160 --> 35:03.650
I ALSO HAVE THIS.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.125
GUESS WHO WROTE THE NOTE
THAT WAS CLENCHED

35:05.230 --> 35:06.595
IN MR. CREECH'S DEAD HAND?

35:06.700 --> 35:08.258
- OKAY, OKAY, SALLY.
YOU GOT ME, ALL RIGHT?

35:08.370 --> 35:09.598
YOU GOT ME.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.258
YOU KNOW WHO WROTE NOTE
TO CREECH? ME!

35:11.370 --> 35:12.564
IT WAS ME.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:12.670 --> 35:14.137
I DID NOT KILL HIM.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.105
- MR. GUSTER,
I KNOW TWO THINGS TO BE TRUE.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.440
ONE, TEDDY FINCHER
IS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.744
- TOLD YOU.
- SUCK IT, SHAWN.

35:19.850 --> 35:22.774
- TWO, YOU DID NOT KILL
MR. CREECH.

35:22.820 --> 35:23.172
- THANK YOU.

35:24.420 --> 35:26.718
- YOU CRAFTY SON
OF A BITCH.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.788
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHO KILLED CREECH, DON'T YOU?

35:28.820 --> 35:29.184
WELL, GO AHEAD.
TELL US WHO IT IS.

35:33.930 --> 35:36.296
SALLY?
SALLY!

35:36.400 --> 35:38.163
WHAT--

35:39.600 --> 35:41.693
SALLY?

35:46.010 --> 35:48.899
- GUS, REMIND ME
WHAT DEJA VU IS.

35:49.010 --> 35:50.602
- THIS IS DEJA VU.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.405
- GUS, YOU REALIZE THAT BAG
IS A TREASURE TROVE OF OUR DNA?

35:52.510 --> 35:53.909
- OH.

35:54.010 --> 35:56.217
- BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS,
HAIR, YOUR BOOGIES.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.309
- WE'RE GONNA FRY
FOR THIS, SHAWN.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.887
- YEAH.
WELL, YOU'LL FRY.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.787
I'LL PLEAD DOWN TO COMMUNITY
SERVICE OF SOME KIND.

36:00.820 --> 36:01.184
- WHAT?

36:02.660 --> 36:04.218
- BUT I AM STILL WITH YOU
ON THIS THING, MAN.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.628
AND IF YOU WANNA GO
AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR,

36:06.730 --> 36:08.288
LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.857
THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY
NOT DISPOSE OF THAT EVIDENCE.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.360
BUT IF YOU WANNA STICK
WITH TRADITION,

36:13.470 --> 36:16.496
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

36:16.600 --> 36:18.830
THEN WE SHOULD JUST--
- NO, NO, NO.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.862
I'M NOT TOUCHING A THING,
SHAWN.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.676
I DON'T NEED TO.
YOU KNOW WHY?

36:22.780 --> 36:25.806
I'M INNOCENT,
AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET ME FREE.

36:25.910 --> 36:28.708
- HURRICANE CARTER,
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.741
- I'M PROUD OF ME TOO.

36:29.850 --> 36:31.647
- BUT THE TRUTH
IS GONNA LAND YOU IN A FIELD.

36:31.750 --> 36:34.856
PROBABLY IN MOAB
IN FRONT OF A FIRING SQUAD

36:34.960 --> 36:36.780
FULL OF MEN THAT LOOK
LIKE PATRICK WILSON.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.323
- SPENCER! GUSTER!

36:38.430 --> 36:41.797
YOU TWO HAVE A LOT
OF EXPLAINING TO DO.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.528
- THIS ENDS NOW,
SHAWN.

36:58.410 --> 37:00.241
- GUS!

37:01.420 --> 37:02.648
NEVER!

37:02.750 --> 37:03.910
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.
FOLLOW ME.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.909
- WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT ARE YOU--

37:07.020 --> 37:09.887
PLAY TIME'S OVER, SALLY.
GET UP.

37:09.990 --> 37:11.457
SALLY!

37:14.630 --> 37:18.259
OH, CRAP.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.961
GUSTER.

37:28.070 --> 37:29.571
SHERMAN, CALL THIS IN.
SECURE THE CRIME SCENE.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.977
MORRISON AND WHATEVER THE HELL
YOUR NAME IS,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.742
COME WITH ME.
- WE HAVE A BODY--

37:55.600 --> 37:57.932
- WHERE THE HELL
ARE WE?

37:58.040 --> 38:01.373
- IT'S IN TIMES LIKE THESE,
OUR DARKEST HOURS,

38:01.480 --> 38:02.936
I FIND CLARITY--
- SORRY, EVERYBODY.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.439
SORRY.
SORRY, EVERYONE!

38:04.550 --> 38:06.848
EXCUSE US.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.784
WITH REGARDS
TO THIS MONTH'S SALES CONTEST,

38:12.890 --> 38:15.950
FIRST PRIZE IS
A CADILLAC EL DORADO.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.618
SECOND PRIZE,
A SET OF STEAK KNIVES.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.654
- SHAWN, WE DO NOT HAVE TIME
FOR BALDWIN.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.648
LASSIE'S GONNA COME OVER
IN THAT CORNER ANY SECOND NOW

38:21.760 --> 38:23.296
AND ARREST US.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.391
IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT
I WILL GIVE YOU ALL CLOSURE.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.298
I KNOW WHO KILLED
DORIAN CREECH.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.460
IT WAS THIS GUY.

38:31.570 --> 38:34.403
MITCH MURRAY,
THE SHARP-DRESSED SALESMAN

38:34.510 --> 38:36.808
WHO GAVE HIS LIFE
TO THIS COMPANY,

38:36.840 --> 38:36.999
BUT HE WAS ALSO COOKING
THE BOOKS,

38:38.950 --> 38:40.542
INFLATING THE NUMBERS,
SO IT LOOKED

38:40.650 --> 38:42.948
AS IF EVERY BRANCH OFFICE
OF CENTRAL COAST WAS DOING

38:43.050 --> 38:44.642
GANGBUSTERS BUSINESS.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.980
- THAT IS COMPLETELY
AND CATEGORICALLY FALSE.

38:47.090 --> 38:49.809
- THE POLICE HAVE A LARGE BAG
OF EVIDENCE

38:49.920 --> 38:51.854
ON LEVEL 4F
OF THE PARKING GARAGE.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.029
- 5E, SHAWN.

38:53.130 --> 38:54.995
- INSIDE THIS LARGE BAG,

38:55.100 --> 38:56.795
THEY WILL DISCOVER A FAX

38:56.900 --> 38:59.892
OF VARIOUS EARNING REPORTS
SENT BY DORIAN CREECH,

38:59.930 --> 39:00.021
A FAX CONTAINING
THE REAL NUMBERS.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.800
YOU CAME DOWN HERE
TO SWEET-TALK HIM, DIDN'T YOU?

39:05.910 --> 39:07.537
YOU KNEW HE WAS
ON TO YOUR LITTLE SCHEME,

39:07.640 --> 39:10.108
AND I AM SENSING THAT YOU TRIED
TO BUY HIS SILENCE

39:10.210 --> 39:13.805
BY OFFERING HIM A JOB
AS STARTING SMALL FORWARD

39:13.910 --> 39:15.446
FOR THE SAN ANTONIO SPURS.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.609
- WITH OUR PHARMACEUTICAL
DIVISION IN SAN ANTONIO.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.917
- THAT TOO.
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT THAT JOB!

39:21.020 --> 39:24.922
HE WANTED THE SWEET BIG-WIG JOB
YOU HAVE IN SAC TOWN.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.622
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:26.730 --> 39:29.449
I DON'T WANT YOUR STUPID JOB
IN SAN ANTONIO.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.993
I'M GONNA GET YOUR JOB.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.590
- AND BECAUSE DORIAN CREECH

39:32.700 --> 39:34.565
IS A THREE-TIME GOLD MEDALIST
OF D-BAGS,

39:34.670 --> 39:37.730
HE RELISHED THE OPPORTUNITY
TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.559
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

39:40.670 --> 39:42.001
- [groans]

39:42.110 --> 39:43.634
- YOU STABBED HIM,

39:43.740 --> 39:46.470
THREE TIMES IN THE BACK
WITH A LETTER OPENER.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.775
- ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LISTEN
TO THIS GUY

39:48.880 --> 39:50.939
WHO DOESN'T EVEN TUCK IN
HIS SHIRT?

39:51.050 --> 39:52.085
- NO ONE EVEN KNOWS
YOUR NAME.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.885
- WHAT'S MY NAME?

39:53.990 --> 39:55.958
SUCK IT.
THAT'S MY NAME.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.812
AND WHAT'S
YOUR FATAL FLAW?

39:57.860 --> 39:58.053
YOU DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT ONE OF YOUR CONTACT LENSES

39:59.960 --> 40:01.757
POPPED OUT
DURING THE ATTACK.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.693
- THIS IS MR. MURRAY,
SVP FROM CORPORATE.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.893
- THAT'S WHAT PUT YOU
AT THE CRIME SCENE, JACK.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.831
AND WHAT YOU DEFINITELY
DIDN'T COUNT ON

40:08.870 --> 40:09.029
WAS ROCK STAR BAD-ASS
SECURITY GUARD

40:11.000 --> 40:13.901
VALERIE LAVERNE SALLY.
- HIS NAME IS LESLIE, SHAWN.

40:14.010 --> 40:15.602
- SALLY WAS GETTING TOO CLOSE,

40:15.710 --> 40:16.836
JUST HOURS AWAY
FROM RESTORING THE FOOTAGE

40:16.880 --> 40:17.039
ON THE DAMAGED SECURITY
HARD DRIVES.

40:20.210 --> 40:24.943
SO YOU POISONED
THE MAN'S THERMOS!

40:25.050 --> 40:28.952
- NOW THE $60,000 QUESTION,
IS THAT ACCURATE?

40:32.590 --> 40:34.729
YOU'RE DARN RIGHT IT IS.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.889
NOWADAYS,
I GOTTA PUMP UP NUMBERS

40:37.000 --> 40:39.992
AND MAKE EXCUSES
FOR ALL YOU LOSERS

40:40.100 --> 40:42.091
AND THAT GREEDY SON OF A SAILOR
DORIAN CREECH.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.760
HE DECIDES HE'S GONNA OUT ME
AND TAKE MY JOB?

40:44.870 --> 40:47.600
WELL, THAT WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN--
NOT BY HIM, NOT BY NOBODY.

40:47.710 --> 40:50.873
I EVEN PROMOTED THIS BOOB
TO LEAD THE BRANCH

40:50.980 --> 40:53.801
SO AS TO AVOID THAT
EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.741
- DO NOT MOVE!

40:55.850 --> 40:59.786
SPENCER! GUSTER!
I AM--

40:59.890 --> 41:01.141
HE JUST SOLVED IT,
DIDN'T HE?

41:01.250 --> 41:03.013
DAMN IT!

41:03.120 --> 41:05.623
YOU TWO NIMRODS STILL HAVE
A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.925
- [grunts]

41:08.030 --> 41:10.021
- EH?

41:10.130 --> 41:11.825
- HELEN.

41:11.930 --> 41:13.864
GOODNESS.

41:13.970 --> 41:16.165
- I LIKE YOUR SHIRT, GUS.

41:16.270 --> 41:20.832
- THAN KS, FINCHY.
THAN KS.

41:20.940 --> 41:21.838
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

41:25.310 --> 41:29.770
[phone ringing]

41:31.850 --> 41:34.614
- PSYCH.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.608
FINCHY,
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.257
YES, OF COURSE
I LIKE SPICY FOOD.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.954
WHAT? NO, I CAN'T GO OUT
TO DINNER WITH YOU.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.891
AS A FRIEND OR--

41:44.000 --> 41:46.628
NO, I WILL NOT TEXT YOU LATER.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.092
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.633
- GUS' CO-WORKER'S
IN LOVE WITH HIM,

41:50.740 --> 41:53.129
BUT HE'S A SMOKER.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.936
- GUYS,
I'VE MADE A DECISION.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.974
I WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN
IN THE DARK

41:58.080 --> 41:59.604
WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAYS
YOU GUYS

41:59.710 --> 42:01.871
GO ABOUT SOLVING YOUR CASES.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.242
- JULES, THAT IS
A VERY WISE DECISION

42:03.350 --> 42:04.988
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE
IN THE DARK.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.843
THE TRUE BEAUTY IS THAT YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

42:07.890 --> 42:08.049
GUS AND I NEVER LEAVE
ANYTHING BEHIND

42:09.860 --> 42:13.523
WHEN WE CLEAN UP
OUR MESSES.

42:16.030 --> 42:18.021
- [whimpering]

42:19.170 --> 42:20.694
[groaning]

42:20.800 --> 42:21.892
AH!

42:22.000 --> 42:22.864
HEY, GUYS.

42:22.900 --> 42:23.059
both: WOODY.
