10:15.840 --> 10:17.960
I knew she wasn't happy with me.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.080
The way I'd been behaving.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.680
You mean... the recklessness?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.560
Yeah.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.759
I knew it was a problem
and I wanted to fix it.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.959
That's the reason why we were
going to couples' therapy.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.559
But why did Ari agree to it
if she knew

10:43.560 --> 10:46.879
that she was interested
in this guy from work?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.959
I mean, why was she
wasting my time, man?

10:49.960 --> 10:53.920
Making me feel like it was me,
like it was all my fault.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.599
Well, listen,
you're welcome to stay here

11:00.600 --> 11:02.959

11:02.960 --> 11:05.359
OK. As long as you like.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.800
You don't have to do that, Roy.

I told you to take the day off?

12:05.800 --> 12:07.679
And do what?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.959
You don't even have Netflix, Roy.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.799
I mean, all your DVDs
are Spaghetti Westerns,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.479
you don't have an Xbox or a PS5.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.120
I mean, seriously, what do you do
when you're at home.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.799
Are you saying that my house is sad?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.999
Er... tragic.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.959
OK, well...
Excuse me, Roy.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.839
A young woman called Mimi Taylor
was raped last night

12:29.840 --> 12:31.319
in the Royal Edward Hotel.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.759
The suspect's unknown.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.999
They assaulted the victim
with a sex toy.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.439
The sexual offences
investigative officer

12:38.440 --> 12:41.279
says it's politically sensitive
and wants you to take a look.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.359
Are you telling me that the victim
was at Vosper's leaving do?

12:44.360 --> 12:45.999
She was indeed.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.159
The SOIT officer's on her way
over to see her.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.400
You went to bed?
Yes.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.960
What's the next thing you remember?

12:56.080 --> 12:59.159
I woke up
and he was already in my room...

12:59.160 --> 13:00.840
crawling on my bed.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.519
Exactly what did you see?

13:04.520 --> 13:07.519
It was dark.
I could barely make him out.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.440
I could feel the weight of him,
but I couldn't see him.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.440
And then what happened?

13:16.120 --> 13:18.560
Then I realised he was covered
in black rubber.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.440
His face and everything,
like an alien, a monster.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.559
You're doing really well.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.319
I felt like I was
watching it all happen

13:28.320 --> 13:30.319
from the other side of the room.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.719
I wasn't in my body at all, I was...

13:32.720 --> 13:34.399
I was just numb.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.759
I didn't move. I didn't scream.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.239
I should have screamed,
but I couldn't.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.279

Roy.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.440
Are you OK?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.879
Ten years ago when I was a DS,

14:05.880 --> 14:09.039
there was a series of rapes
just like this.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.959
The press called him
The Brighton Prowler.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.199
We didn't catch him.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.200
And when the attacks stopped,
I hoped he was dead.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.799
Simple. OK?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.999
So, who drives white vans?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.199
Tradesmen.

15:23.200 --> 15:27.119
I wanna look at every self-employed
able-bodied man in this city.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.559
That is every plumber, plasterer,
electrician, builder,

15:30.560 --> 15:32.599
anyone who has access
to a white van.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.439
The guy we're looking for

15:34.440 --> 15:36.519
is willing to grab a girl
off of the streets

15:36.520 --> 15:38.440
so he's reckless, impulsive.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.120
Go ahead, sergeant.

15:42.200 --> 15:46.679
The rapist wears a latex body suit
and uses a sex toy, right?

15:46.680 --> 15:50.040
Kinky sod, yeah.
Or forensically aware?

15:51.080 --> 15:54.319
We haven't found a trace of fibre
or DNA on any of the victims.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.679
Point being?

15:55.680 --> 15:58.439
Well, the point being that
that doesn't sound reckless

15:58.440 --> 16:00.199
or impulsive to me.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.519
That sounds controlled and planned.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.239
He's a perv...

16:04.240 --> 16:07.479
grabbing girls off the streets
at night when he sees the chance.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.519
Dumps 'em in a lay-by after.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.039
Does it after work
with a van full of tools.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.719
This isn't the work
of a criminal mastermind.

16:14.720 --> 16:19.639
I think we might be underestimating
who we're dealing with here.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.159
So what would you have us
do differently, sergeant?

16:22.160 --> 16:24.399
I would widen the suspect profile.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.679
To what?

16:26.680 --> 16:28.480
Every man in the city?

16:29.840 --> 16:33.719
Ten years ago, a guy wearing
a full latex body suit

16:33.720 --> 16:38.039
raped his victims with a sex toy
in the back of a white van.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.399
We called him The Brighton Prowler.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.519
Skerritt was convinced
he was a local tradesman.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.119
We put hours into tracking down
every white van man in Brighton.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.919
We never caught him.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.319
So, what? He just stopped? Why?

16:52.320 --> 16:54.759
Well, jail time is
the obvious answer.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.119
It's also possible he moved away,

16:57.120 --> 17:01.119
abroad, perhaps,
and continued offending

17:01.120 --> 17:02.799
and now has returned.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.999
Or he could have been in
a relationship which has now ended.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.959
Mimi was raped in her hotel room.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.239
So same guy, different MO?

17:10.240 --> 17:12.639
Or different guy altogether?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.079
Copy cat.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.759
The Prowler used to steal
the victim's lipstick

17:17.760 --> 17:19.679
after the attack.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.479
And Mimi Taylor has confirmed
that her assailant stole one too.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.880
A MAC... Lady Danger.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.919
Nick, could you go down to storage

17:30.920 --> 17:34.759
after the briefing and pick up
all the files on Operation Moonfall.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.119
You'll need a swipe card to get in.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.639
Yes, boss.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.879
OK, we have a list here
of all the attendees

17:42.880 --> 17:46.919
at Vosper's party and all
the other functions in the hotel,

17:46.920 --> 17:50.279
all the guests that stayed overnight
and the staff.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.439
The attacker was in the hotel
on Friday evening.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.439
His name could be
on that list somewhere.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.799
Are police interviewing
the top brass?

17:57.800 --> 18:00.279
This one's gonna ruffle
a lot of feathers.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.639
Yeah, I'd prefer to call it
material witnesses to be eliminated

18:04.640 --> 18:06.759
from our inquiry.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.720
And, by the way,
do we have any volunteers?

18:12.680 --> 18:15.560
Looks like I'm the only one
with the balls for the job, eh?

18:17.640 --> 18:21.719
OK, also find out who on that list
was in Brighton July 2012.

18:21.720 --> 18:25.319
Most of the guests don't seem local
and the staff turnover's pretty high

18:25.320 --> 18:28.039
so I'm gonna say not many.
Good.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.759
CCTV?

18:29.760 --> 18:31.839
Hotel only has cameras in the foyer.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.639
So if the attacker
was a member of staff,

18:33.640 --> 18:36.399
he could have used the service
entrance. Is that not covered?

18:36.400 --> 18:37.879
Afraid not.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.759
Where are we with Mimi Taylor's
mobile phone?

18:40.760 --> 18:42.799
Waiting on digital forensics.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.000
OK. Let's get to it.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.799
This is everything?
Er...

18:52.800 --> 18:54.719
Isn't this enough?

18:54.720 --> 18:57.199
Well, the victim statement files
aren't here.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.519
This is all of Operation Moonfall.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.479
There's nothing left downstairs
but dust.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.160
We've checked. This is it.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.839
HE SIGHS

19:05.840 --> 19:09.239
I need you to go through
all these boxes, log every file,

19:09.240 --> 19:11.840
find out if anything else
has gone missing.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.879
I'm gonna have to re-interview
the original victims.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.399
Find out where they are.
Set that up.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.119
Wow.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.999
After all these years
thinking you'd put it behind you

19:23.000 --> 19:24.399
then getting a call like that.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.439
Without the victims' statements,
there is no case.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.120
I've got no choice.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.359
So Norman and Bella
tracked down the Prowler's victims

19:36.360 --> 19:41.320
and found that Jade Albright
committed suicide in 2015...

19:42.840 --> 19:45.719
..Lea Brooks moved to New Zealand,

19:45.720 --> 19:49.119
and Anna Bolney stayed put.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.960
CHILDREN CHATTER

19:54.360 --> 19:58.359
So I hear nothing for a decade,
and then you turn up out of the blue

19:58.360 --> 20:00.080
and tell me
you've lost my statement?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.919
It was a massive inquiry

20:02.920 --> 20:05.399
and sometimes
evidence gets misplaced.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.640
I'm so sorry.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.439
Well, I can't say that
I'm that surprised, to be honest,

20:10.440 --> 20:11.599
given the way I was treated.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.479
What do you mean?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.839
The contempt.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.119
You know, after the attack,

20:17.120 --> 20:19.919
all the detective wanted to know
was how short my skirt was,

20:19.920 --> 20:23.759
if I was wearing any make-up,
how much I'd had to drink.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.640
He acted like he was hardly
surprised that I'd been raped.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.239
I was 20.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.999
I was walking home
from a friend's house

20:31.000 --> 20:33.359
that was only five minutes away
and pulled into a van.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.039
Why does a few drinks mean
that I deserve that?

20:36.040 --> 20:39.480
We're... we're really sorry
you were treated that way.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.439
I can't change the past, Anna,

20:42.440 --> 20:45.319
or take away the pain
of what happened to you,

20:45.320 --> 20:49.120
but I can promise to do better
if you will give us the chance.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.560
I think I was in shock...
after the attack.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.480
I could barely speak.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.320
Then a few days after the interview,
I remembered...

21:04.360 --> 21:06.919
..the radio had been playing
in the van.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.879
I thought about telling
the detective

21:08.880 --> 21:10.920
but I couldn't face
seeing him again.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.240
Tell me about the radio.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.240
It was just so strange.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.919
I was being attacked by this monster
in the back of a van

21:22.920 --> 21:24.360
and the music was...

21:26.560 --> 21:27.640
..beautiful.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.280
Classical.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.400
That's a really useful detail, Anna.
Thank you.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.519
It's not nothing.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.960
I can't stand to listen to anything
like that now.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.479
It makes me spiral.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.720
CHILDREN CHATTER OUTSIDE

21:47.920 --> 21:49.999
Can you remember the name
of the detective

21:50.000 --> 21:51.480
who took your statement?

21:53.560 --> 21:55.999
Sid Barrow.
Get him on the phone.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.079
No, I can't, boss, he's gone.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.079
I know he's retired.
No.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.399
He shuffled off this mortal coil.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.199
Heart attack in Malaga
year after he got his pension.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.999
He interviewed Anna Bolney
after she was raped,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.799
treated her with contempt.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.159
Made her feel like she was to blame.
Course he did.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.239
Yeah, I did a stint with him
back in the day.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.479
Talk about old school,
he was your teacher.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.839
I know the type.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.359
Chauvinistic, misogynistic.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.919
Look, I'm not saying it was right,

22:22.920 --> 22:24.999
I'm just saying he was
last of the old breed.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.119
Because of Barrow's
complete lack of empathy,

22:28.120 --> 22:31.559
Anna didn't feel able to report
a crucial detail

22:31.560 --> 22:33.279
about the rape.
What detail?

22:33.280 --> 22:36.239
The Prowler was
a classical music fan.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.199
Right, so...

22:38.200 --> 22:40.439
not your average white van man.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.719
When did you ever hear
a few bars of Schubert

22:42.720 --> 22:45.119
being played
on a building site? Hm?

22:45.120 --> 22:47.280
I wish I'd known this ten years ago.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.960
SHE PANTS

23:10.400 --> 23:13.240
SHE BREATHES RAPIDLY

23:17.960 --> 23:20.960
TAPE RIPS

23:35.600 --> 23:37.680
SHE PANTS

24:08.520 --> 24:10.400
METAL CLANKS

25:05.440 --> 25:08.560
SHE WHIMPERS

25:16.400 --> 25:17.799
Well, his name is Jack.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.679
And I swear, Sasha, if he doesn't
look exactly like his profile pic,

25:20.680 --> 25:21.799
I'm going home.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.800
I'm so tired of short, middle-aged,
bald men walking up like that's OK.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.399
Well, his suits are on point,
though, so wish me luck.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.560
And don't wait up, OK?
Love you! Mwah.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.840
Thought you might be hungry.

26:12.360 --> 26:15.200
Oh! Starving.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.479
Hey.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.200
Hello.
Hello.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.560
Right.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.879
I don't want to interrupt your flow.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.840
No, please interrupt.
I needed a break.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.280
So, this is your home from home?
Mm-hm.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.519
I've slept here more times
than I can remember.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.839
There's actually a knack to
putting the chairs together

26:47.840 --> 26:49.519
that makes them almost comfortable.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.040
SHE LAUGHS
Mm.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.680
Mm.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.440
How's it going with Glenn?

27:00.400 --> 27:03.239
It's like living with a teenager.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.479
Dirty plates in his room,
loud music.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.280
Has he spoken to Ari yet?

27:09.520 --> 27:10.719
No.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.599
I feel so sad for them.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.480
It's driving me crazy that
I can't get him to talk to her.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.879
I really want them
to get through this.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.240
Maybe they can't.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.480
But they're so good together.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.000
You can't save everybody, Roy.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.280
SIREN WAILS

27:47.120 --> 27:49.040
PHONE BUZZES

27:50.280 --> 27:53.440
Oh, er, sorry.
No, go, take it.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.839
Grace.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.799
Roy, it's Detective Marcel Kullen
from Munich Police.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.679
Marcel, I wasn't expecting
to hear from you so soon.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.959
I visited the place your friend
Dominic thought he saw her.

28:07.960 --> 28:11.759
I have shown Sandy's picture
in all the cafes and shops.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.160
I am sorry to tell you that
no-one remembers seeing her.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.119
'Is it possible that your friend
was mistaken?'

28:19.120 --> 28:23.159
Yeah. Yeah, it's...
it's possible.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.079
It's just that, erm...

28:25.080 --> 28:28.359
Sandy's grandmother had a house
outside Munich.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.040
Sandy used to go there as a child.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.279
It held good memories for her.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.160
I can see why you thought
it was a good lead.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.239
I am so sorry I don't have
better news for you, Roy.

28:39.240 --> 28:43.600
No, not at all.
Erm... Thanks again for your help.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.200
You all right?

28:54.120 --> 28:55.720
Yeah, nothing to report.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.240
Did you save me a spring roll?

29:26.040 --> 29:29.039
Roy, digital forensics sent through
all the texts

29:29.040 --> 29:31.080
they got off Mimi Taylor's phone.

29:32.320 --> 29:36.320
I've highlighted the last text she
received the night of the attack.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.679
Cassian Pewe?

29:42.680 --> 29:45.399
Looks like he wanted to see her
that night,

29:45.400 --> 29:48.040
and she said no,
she wasn't in the mood.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.319
Has he been interviewed yet?

29:51.320 --> 29:53.599
No. He's on my list.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.720
Move him to the top.
Absolutely.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.079
Sorry to bother you, Sid,
I'm looking for Skerritt.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.640
Stuck at a press conference.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.360
You got a lead?
Yeah. Erm...

30:19.840 --> 30:21.919
It's all right,
I'll talk to Skerritt later.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.519
You can talk to me now.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.119
You know everything
has to go through me first.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.439
Chain of command.

30:27.440 --> 30:30.760
Clear lines of communication
prevents misunderstandings.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.239
We've had a report
of a missing woman, Rachel Ryan.

30:37.240 --> 30:41.839
Last seen walking home
along St James's Row last night.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.519
Her parents were
expecting her home today

30:45.520 --> 30:47.639
as it's her birthday,
but she never showed up.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.839
They checked her flat

30:49.840 --> 30:51.760
and it looks like
she never made it home.

30:52.760 --> 30:56.479
That's it?
No. The CCTV...

30:56.480 --> 31:00.640
picked up a white van
travelling down the road at speed.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.519
Now, I think there's a good chance
Rachel Ryan was abducted

31:06.520 --> 31:08.559
by the Prowler.
Plates?

31:08.560 --> 31:11.359
No, the CCTV was really
poor quality.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.519
The other victims were abducted
for an hour or so

31:13.520 --> 31:15.519
and then dumped in a lay-by
outside the city.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.759
They didn't disappear for days.
It's the wrong MO, it's not our man.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.759
Maybe something went wrong.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.639
Maybe he kept hold of her longer.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.440
Maybe, maybe, maybe.
Anyone see this girl get in the van?

31:27.600 --> 31:30.559
No. No reports of screaming,
cries for help?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.800
No. No.
So she could be at a pal's house.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.919
Could have found something
more exciting to do

31:35.920 --> 31:37.640
than tea with her parents
on her birthday.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.560
With all due respect, sir...
With all due respect...

31:43.480 --> 31:45.199
..we've got the press
baying for blood

31:45.200 --> 31:47.399
and the last thing
we need right now is more panic

31:47.400 --> 31:51.120
cos of your long shot hunch that
doesn't even fit the suspect's MO.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.680
What about Rachel Ryan, then?

31:58.400 --> 32:00.559
You want to look for her
in your own time,

32:00.560 --> 32:01.960
I'm not gonna stop you.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.599
Oh, congratulations, sir,
on your new appointment.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.720
We're all... really looking forward
to working with you.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.439
Erm...
Potting, sir.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.759
DS Norman Potting.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.680
Right.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.159
Oh, of course,

32:28.160 --> 32:30.919
we need to clear up that
small matter of your text

32:30.920 --> 32:33.639
you sent to Mimi Taylor
on the evening of her assault.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.199
I beg your pardon.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.239
Your text, sir.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.799
It's a bit unfortunate,
don't you think?

32:39.800 --> 32:42.960
Asking a woman if she's up for it
moments before she's raped.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.600
Follow me.

32:55.520 --> 32:58.120
I sincerely hope you're not implying
that I was responsible.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.159
No, I'm talking to all
the top brass, you know,

33:02.160 --> 33:05.440
tying up the loose ends,
making myself popular.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.519
After the event ended,
I had a drink in the hotel bar

33:09.520 --> 33:12.719
with Alison Vosper,
the Police and Crime Commissioner

33:12.720 --> 33:14.199
and the leader of the council.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.159
I hope those alibis
are good enough for you.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.399
And what time did you get back
to your room? Around 11.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.039
Where were you at 12:15?

33:21.040 --> 33:22.479
In my room.
Alone?

33:22.480 --> 33:23.839
Of course.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.159
You didn't leave the room

33:25.160 --> 33:27.879
to go and see Mimi Taylor
after you texted her?

33:27.880 --> 33:29.719
No.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.199
Her reply said
she wasn't interested.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.240
And there's no alibi for that,
right?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.919
Oh, sir, sir, sorry,

33:38.920 --> 33:41.200
just... just one more question.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.279
Were you in Brighton in July 2012?

33:46.280 --> 33:48.960
You know, the time of the Olympics?

33:50.120 --> 33:51.719
I'll have to check my diary.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.319
HE SCOFFS

33:53.320 --> 33:56.479
You have...
Right, you don't know where you were

33:56.480 --> 33:58.760
at the time when we were winning
all those gold medals?

33:59.880 --> 34:01.439
Bradley Wiggins,

34:01.440 --> 34:04.279
Victoria Pendleton, Anthony Joshua?

34:04.280 --> 34:07.959
I was on secondment in Brighton
but also in London.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.440
If you give me the exact dates,
I will check against my diary.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.199
Well, thank you, sir.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.999
And believe me when I say that

34:17.000 --> 34:19.840
this is uncomfortable for me too.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.040
I think we're done.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.399
PEOPLE CHATTER

34:36.400 --> 34:38.279
How did your date go
with Jack last night?

34:38.280 --> 34:40.159
Honestly, I thought
it would be all right

34:40.160 --> 34:42.119
because he looked like his profile,

34:42.120 --> 34:45.759
but after a few drinks
he suggested we go to a hotel,

34:45.760 --> 34:46.999
and I was like, "No".

34:47.000 --> 34:49.279
Then he went completely silent
and just stared at me.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.719
Urgh, awkward.
Yeah, I left.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.200
Next. Wrist band.

34:53.200 --> 34:56.280
Why are guys like that?
SHE LAUGHS

34:57.240 --> 35:00.679
I mean, is it all of them, though?
Or is it just the ones that I pick?

35:00.680 --> 35:03.920
LAUGHTER,
TRAIN HOOTS

35:06.960 --> 35:09.559
THEY SHRIEK AND LAUGH

35:09.560 --> 35:11.599
THEY SCREAM

35:11.600 --> 35:13.840
MENACING LAUGHTER

35:16.240 --> 35:18.360
SAW WHIRRS

35:20.920 --> 35:22.879
THEY SHRIEK

35:22.880 --> 35:24.959
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

35:24.960 --> 35:27.040
MENACING LAUGHTER

35:31.040 --> 35:34.119
SIRENS WAIL

35:34.120 --> 35:36.600
THUNDER CLAPS
'Please do not step out of the car.'

35:37.840 --> 35:39.440
SHE SCREAMS

35:42.280 --> 35:44.359
SHE SCREAMS
Get off!

35:44.360 --> 35:46.439
I want to get out!

35:46.440 --> 35:47.799
What's going on?

35:47.800 --> 35:50.800
He just put his hand inside my top.
I can't be here, I have to get out.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.519
MENACING LAUGHTER

35:54.520 --> 35:56.679
He was just scaring you.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.439
No, I'm not an idiot!
He touched me up.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.039
You was grabbed.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.399
It's part of the experience.
People like it.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.639
I DIDN'T like it.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.799
Well, then, maybe you'd better stick
to the kiddies' rides.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.399
Come on.
What the...

36:10.400 --> 36:12.200
Waste of time. Ridiculous.
I know.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.199
Johnny.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.680
What have I told you
about grabbing girls?

36:28.680 --> 36:30.040
Do you want 'em scared or not?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.720
You're gonna get into real trouble
one of these days.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.920
HE LAUGHS
Get off.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.559
Detective Kullen has said
the Munich Police

36:44.560 --> 36:47.279
have drawn a blank on Sandy.
There's no trace of her.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.959
Oh!

36:48.960 --> 36:51.200
So I have to ask you, Dom...

36:52.760 --> 36:56.200
..are you 100% certain
that it was her you saw?

36:57.200 --> 36:58.600
I was at the time.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.639
Is there any chance
you could have been mistaken?

37:02.640 --> 37:05.240
I thought I saw her,
then she was gone.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.879
I went back to the cafe
a couple of times, you know,

37:09.880 --> 37:12.639
hoping she'd be there again
so I could speak to her

37:12.640 --> 37:15.320
but nothing.
Maybe I imagined her.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.000
HE SIGHS

37:19.520 --> 37:21.800
Well, I've imagined her
quite a few times.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.080
Look, I've started the process of
having Sandy legally declared dead.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.519
I've taken out ads
in the German newspapers.

37:30.520 --> 37:35.159
Anyone that might know her has
21 days to reply to the High Court.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.920
Has anyone come forward?
No. No-one.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.880
Oh, sorry, Roy.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.080
Yeah, me too.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.080
SEAGULLS CRY

37:58.760 --> 38:00.120
SHE TYPES

38:10.240 --> 38:13.559
CAT MEOWS
Queenie.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.840
SHE KISSES
What is it?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.520
SHE SCREAMS

38:26.120 --> 38:30.839
Roxy Harris was attacked and raped
last night in her own home.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.799
Her description of the assailant
suggests it could be the Prowler.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.759
Any lipstick stolen?
Yeah. Vincenze in Bold Rose.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.199
Initial reports from forensics
aren't good.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.679
There's no prints or DNA samples
found at the scene so far.

38:42.680 --> 38:46.119
So he used to grab his victims
off the street and into a van,

38:46.120 --> 38:48.519
and now he's entering hotel rooms
and houses.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.239
That's a big change in MO.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.399
I always knew he was
a careful planner.

38:52.400 --> 38:56.879
He appeared to be a risk taker
but each of these abductions

38:56.880 --> 39:00.119
was flawless,
no witnesses, no clues.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.199
I think what we're seeing now
is not so much a change in his MO,

39:03.200 --> 39:05.199
more a evolution.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.839
In these two recent attacks,

39:07.840 --> 39:10.039
he waited inside for his victims.

39:10.040 --> 39:14.479
That shows an enormous degree
of planning and confidence.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.639
He must know these areas here
very well.

39:17.640 --> 39:21.039
He knew his way around the hotel, he
knew everything about Roxy's house.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.079
He's got to be scoping them out
before he strikes.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.159
Yeah, Nick,
check all the CCTV footage

39:26.160 --> 39:28.799
around Roxy's house
from the past week. Yes, boss.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.679
And if everything's planned
and nothing's left to chance,

39:31.680 --> 39:33.959
he's carefully selecting
his victims.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.679
Do they have something in common?

39:35.680 --> 39:38.599
Bella, check their mobile phones,
their social media,

39:38.600 --> 39:41.359
where they visit, where they eat,

39:41.360 --> 39:43.239
there must be
a connection somewhere.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.799
Oh, and... as of today,

39:46.800 --> 39:51.599
I am adding Rachel Ryan to the list
of the Prowler's victims.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.639
She disappeared July 27th, 2012.

39:55.640 --> 39:59.079
Yeah, but she wasn't included
in the Operation Moonfall inquiry.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.039
Which was a mistake.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.239
I think that Rachel could have been
the last of the victims

40:04.240 --> 40:06.119
before he disappeared for ten years.

40:06.120 --> 40:09.360
She might be the reason
he was gone for so long.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.520
Are you OK?

40:37.080 --> 40:38.600
I'm just thinking.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.120
About what?

40:56.040 --> 40:58.320
Why am I being treated as a suspect?

40:59.280 --> 41:02.279
You were asked a few questions, sir.
Oh, come off it, Roy.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.040
You texted the victim.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.519
My team are just following
procedure, it's not personal.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.559
Oh, really?

41:09.560 --> 41:13.639
So this has nothing to do with me
looking into Sandy's disappearance?

41:13.640 --> 41:14.919
No.

41:14.920 --> 41:18.599
It's not revenge...
for me digging up your garden?

41:18.600 --> 41:22.480
You were doing your job.
I'm doing my job.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.759
My movements for July 2012.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.320
It's the best that I can remember.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.319
Oh, and don't get excited
about the gaps.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.199
Had I known I was going to be
persecuted a decade later,

41:36.200 --> 41:38.120
I would have been more meticulous.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.799
I was wondering if I could speak to
someone about the rape

41:52.800 --> 41:53.880
at the Royal Edward Hotel.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.359
Anonymously.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.680
His name is Rollo Mercer.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.359
We were all at the hotel that night.
It was our school reunion.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.560
And why do you think Rollo's
the Prowler?

42:06.520 --> 42:08.560
Because he's been a deviant
since he was 14.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.399
I knew it was him straightaway.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.720
How?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.239
Cos he likes to dominate.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.640
Both men and women.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.719
He enjoys their fear.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.720
He's a sadist,
and he thinks that he's untouchable.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.600
What did he do to you?

42:47.040 --> 42:48.600
I couldn't say no.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.200
I wasn't allowed to.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.240
He put lipstick on me, and...

43:00.880 --> 43:02.600
Tell me about the lipstick.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.840
That's in the past.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.520
All that matters now
are these women.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.479
Bella had a tip from a walk-in

43:21.480 --> 43:25.000
naming a man who is also
on our hotel guest list.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.199
We're investigating
a series of rapes

43:31.200 --> 43:35.839
and we know that you were in
the Royal Edward Hotel on July 15th.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.800
The school reunion.
Yeah, I was there.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.600
Do you know the victim, Mimi Taylor?

43:43.840 --> 43:45.120
Not one of ours, no.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.839
Can you tell us
where you were at midnight?

43:47.840 --> 43:51.159
Absolutely. I was with my very good
friends, Mingo...

43:51.160 --> 43:54.719
HE CHUCKLES
Sorry, Miles Hawthorn, Freddie Punt,

43:54.720 --> 43:57.599
and Caspar Barclay, aka Badger,
in the hotel bar.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.719
We were sampling a fine Armagnac
and ruing the smoking ban

44:00.720 --> 44:02.919
that prevents one from enjoying
a fine cigar.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.399
And you were with them
the whole time?

44:05.400 --> 44:08.479
Well... not the whole time.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.079
I went for a slash,

44:10.080 --> 44:13.160
caught up with my old house master,
it was a social evening.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.999
Is there anything else?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.919
Yeah. Where were you last night?

44:18.920 --> 44:20.239
Last night?

44:20.240 --> 44:22.919
Er... Sunday...

44:22.920 --> 44:25.639
I was here, working.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.079
On a Sunday?
Hm. Not unusual.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.000
Bo was here, she'll vouch for me.

44:31.360 --> 44:32.400
Bo.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.799
Last night,
we were working here, right?

44:40.800 --> 44:42.320
Yeah.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.919
Are you sure?
Yeah.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.200
There you go. Thank you, Bo.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.159
July 2012.
Hm.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.479
Sorry, what about it?

44:58.480 --> 44:59.839
Were you in Brighton?

44:59.840 --> 45:02.919
It was the London Olympics,
if that helps.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.479
I... Yes.

45:05.480 --> 45:07.079
HE CHUCKLES

45:07.080 --> 45:09.679
I was in a tight spot financially
trying to set up this agency.

45:09.680 --> 45:12.879
Then I managed to secure some
funding from an angel investor.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.080
Stressful times. But look at me now.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.359
Anna Bolney.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.959
Jade Albright.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.440
Lea Brooks. Rachel Ryan.

45:26.520 --> 45:30.040
Do they ring any bells?
Not on my books. No.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.879
Is that it?

45:32.880 --> 45:34.999
Are we done?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.279
For now.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.879
Think he could be the Prowler?

45:38.880 --> 45:42.400
I think he's something.
Made my skin crawl.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.840
Yeah, right, thanks.

45:52.120 --> 45:55.239
I've been looking through
Mimi Taylor and Roxy Harris's phones

45:55.240 --> 45:56.599
and I found a link.

45:56.600 --> 46:00.039
They both used the same cab app
and they both gave a one-star review

46:00.040 --> 46:01.839
to a driver called Johnny Kerridge.

46:01.840 --> 46:04.479
What do we know about this guy?

46:04.480 --> 46:07.719
Kerridge works part-time at
the Horror Hotel ride on the pier.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.919
Tripadvisor have had several
complaints from women

46:09.920 --> 46:11.159
saying they assaulted them.

46:11.160 --> 46:14.359
And he still works there?
His mam owns the ride.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.999
You'll love this.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.319
The character he plays on the ride
is the faceless ghoul.

46:19.320 --> 46:22.880
Faceless?
Dresses head to toe in black.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.760
What do you think?

47:08.360 --> 47:10.000
Ten years younger, right?

47:12.560 --> 47:14.600
Am I the prettiest girl you know?

47:16.120 --> 47:17.719
Course, Mum.

47:17.720 --> 47:21.319
And... you'll never leave me...

47:21.320 --> 47:23.040
for someone else?

47:24.360 --> 47:25.880
I'm not going anywhere.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.600
We're a team, Mum.

47:30.440 --> 47:31.840
You know that.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.680
CLUB MUSIC PLAYS

47:50.040 --> 47:51.160
Are you OK?

47:55.320 --> 47:57.999
Have you ever had 100 red flags
on a date?

47:58.000 --> 47:59.280
When have I not?

48:02.960 --> 48:06.440
Go to the bar
and order an angel shot.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.439
Hi.
Hi.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.120
Can I get an angel shot, please?

48:23.760 --> 48:26.120
Yeah, course you can.
Just follow me.

48:33.960 --> 48:37.119
I've called you a cab.
Thank you so much.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.400
Fine, it's not a problem.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.720
Have a safe night.
Thank you, I will.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.720
I hope I done you proud, Reg.

49:27.880 --> 49:29.000
Sleep tight, mate.

49:57.280 --> 49:58.720
Hello?

50:00.320 --> 50:01.400
Excuse me?

50:03.480 --> 50:05.719
CAR ENGINE STARTS
Sorry, you can't park here.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.560
CAR TYRES SCREECH
It's private property.

50:16.320 --> 50:21.040
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING

50:24.520 --> 50:25.960
I'm on my break.

50:31.560 --> 50:34.039
There was an incident
at the Royal Edward Hotel on Friday.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.919
Apparently
you dropped someone off there.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.240
Recognise her?

50:39.160 --> 50:41.599
Yeah, I guess.

50:41.600 --> 50:43.479
Why did she give you
a one-star review?

50:43.480 --> 50:45.120
Cos she was a diva.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.439
You can't say anything
to some of these girls.

50:48.440 --> 50:49.999
They take offence at everything.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.760
Hm. You offend Roxy Harris too?

50:54.640 --> 50:57.119
She's another snowflake.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.120
You get a lot of dissatisfied
customers at the fun fair.

51:01.160 --> 51:04.160
There's a lot of happy ones too.
Not the ones you assault.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.160
It's not assault.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.439
It's part of the ride.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.160
They pay to get scared, so I make
sure they get their money's worth.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.879
I don't discriminate either.

51:14.880 --> 51:18.480
I grab everyone, male, female...
gays, straights.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.440
But... some of these girls...

51:24.440 --> 51:27.559
..complainers, you know,
they're feminists.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.319
They wouldn't know a good time
if it bit 'em.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.720
Right.
So it's your word against theirs?

51:33.200 --> 51:34.759
It's how it works, innit?

51:34.760 --> 51:36.440
HE LAUGHS

51:37.880 --> 51:41.840
Yeah, well, he's denying everything,
but he would, wouldn't he?

51:43.040 --> 51:46.079
Yeah, all right. Good call, boss.
Cheers.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.679
What are we doing?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.879
Keeping him on a tight leash.

51:49.880 --> 51:52.480
ANPR, CCTV, the works.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.840
Any news on the sighting of Sandy?

51:56.960 --> 51:58.639
Well, Dominic's backtracking.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.479
He's now saying he's not even sure
it was her that he saw.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.000
There you go.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.520
It was a mistake.
Yeah, I think so.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.400
Bet you Cleo was relieved
to hear it.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.240
Yeah, I haven't actually
mentioned to Cleo the sighting.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.679
Oh, what?

52:16.680 --> 52:19.280
Roy, why?
Because...

52:20.520 --> 52:21.760
Because...

52:23.760 --> 52:26.159
I've lived with Sandy's ghost
all these years

52:26.160 --> 52:29.999
and I am trying...
I am trying to move on

52:30.000 --> 52:32.959
without messing up
what I've got with Cleo.

52:32.960 --> 52:36.159
I didn't mention the sighting to her
because I thought it might have been

52:36.160 --> 52:38.119
a lot of fuss about nothing,
and I was right.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.080
It was. It was a false alarm.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.200
So, this is Verlaine Road...

52:52.240 --> 52:54.720
..12 hours before Roxy was attacked.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.760
You know we could have done this
at your house.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.280
On the sofas, feet up.

53:03.240 --> 53:06.799
First of all, I don't like
taking work home with me,

53:06.800 --> 53:10.599
and secondly, you've been dropping
chips and sauce all over the place

53:10.600 --> 53:13.119
and I don't particularly want it
on my furniture,

53:13.120 --> 53:14.440
thank you very much.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.520
Come to think of it,
I am running low on shirts.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.920
Might have to borrow one of yours.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.440
OK.

53:27.160 --> 53:31.000
This is an off licence
on Corinthe Street.

53:36.160 --> 53:41.799
You know, you could always go home
and get some fresh clothes from Ari.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.640
That would involve
me talking to her.

53:45.520 --> 53:47.200
Would that be such a bad thing?

53:49.120 --> 53:50.719
Wait.

53:50.720 --> 53:53.800
There. Look. That's Roxy.

53:55.280 --> 53:58.280
This is 24 hours
prior to the attack.

54:06.120 --> 54:08.080
Wait, just run that back.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.400
There, doesn't that look like
she's waiting for Roxy?

54:39.560 --> 54:41.159
We now believe that this woman

54:41.160 --> 54:43.639
might be helping the Prowler
scope his victims,

54:43.640 --> 54:46.479
checking where they live,
who they live with.

54:46.480 --> 54:49.359
It's smart. The victims would notice
if a man was following them,

54:49.360 --> 54:50.639
but not necessarily a woman.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.839
Yeah, but what kind of woman
helps a rapist?

54:52.840 --> 54:55.399
She might not have a choice.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.800
Boss.

54:57.760 --> 55:01.079
I checked the activity logs
for Operation Moonfall.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.679
The victim statements
were definitely there

55:03.680 --> 55:05.919
when the files went into storage
in July 2013.

55:05.920 --> 55:08.519
They were later checked out
in August. By whom?

55:08.520 --> 55:10.119
Still trying to find out.
OK.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.680
Let me know
as soon as you have a name.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.440
SIREN WAILS

55:23.960 --> 55:25.360
Happy birthday, darling.

55:27.320 --> 55:29.039
Thank you.

55:29.040 --> 55:31.679
I thought we could have a drink
before we go for dinner.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.920
Oh, it's a lovely idea, but...

55:34.920 --> 55:36.879
..I'm on duty, I can't drink.

55:36.880 --> 55:40.199
You've been at work all day,
now you're switching off.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.199
For my birthday.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.679
Tell that to Skerritt.
Give me his number and I will.

55:44.680 --> 55:45.999
They've cancelled all leave.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.040
We're on these rape cases
around the clock.

55:49.040 --> 55:50.919
And I still haven't found
Rachel Ryan.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.679
I'm sorry.
Just have a drink.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.400
It's not like anyone will know.

55:56.640 --> 55:59.880
If I get called out and someone
smells alcohol on my breath...

56:01.040 --> 56:03.520
..I could lose my job.
Please, Sandy, understand.

56:06.040 --> 56:09.840
I understand.
I understand all too well.

56:10.880 --> 56:12.479
I will always come second.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.759
If we have a baby,
they'll come second too.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.599
I'll have to show
your son or daughter

56:16.600 --> 56:19.959
pictures of you in the newspaper
so they know who you are.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.360
PHONE BUZZES

56:23.960 --> 56:26.720
SHE SIGHS
Don't.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.559
Choose me.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.600
PHONE CONTINUES BUZZING

56:35.600 --> 56:36.759
Roy Grace.

56:36.760 --> 56:39.319
'Roy, there's a burned body
been found in a barn.'

56:39.320 --> 56:40.960
Could it be Rachel?

56:42.040 --> 56:44.119
'Can't tell.'

56:44.120 --> 56:45.520
OK, I'll be right there.

56:47.280 --> 56:49.960
Why are you more interested
in a dead woman than me?

56:54.840 --> 56:56.239
This is a man.

56:56.240 --> 56:59.759
A very old man at that,
late 70s, 80s.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.479
Small amount of
lung tissue survived,

57:01.480 --> 57:03.719
no sign of smoke
or flame inhalation,

57:03.720 --> 57:06.720
which means he wasn't breathing
when the fire started.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.239
How'd the old fella die?

57:09.240 --> 57:11.879
They found high levels
of chemotherapy drugs

57:11.880 --> 57:14.879
in the remaining tissue,
so maybe an advanced cancer.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.479
Natural causes, then?

57:16.480 --> 57:18.159
The only unnatural thing
was the fire.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.679
Dental records?

57:19.680 --> 57:22.119
Intense heat caused the crowns
to explode.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.759
There's nothing I can see remaining
that could get you anywhere.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.119
I think DNA is gonna be
your best chance,

57:27.120 --> 57:28.560
but a match isn't guaranteed.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.800
Not your Rachel Ryan, then.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.759
I still believe she was a victim
of the Prowler.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.519
Course you do.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.039
We all make mistakes
when we're learning.

57:40.040 --> 57:43.239
If the old man died of cancer,
then why destroy his body?

57:43.240 --> 57:44.639
Why set him on fire?

57:44.640 --> 57:47.319
I can think of lots of reasons.
Number one, benefit fraud.

57:47.320 --> 57:49.919
Cover up your grandad's death,
collect his pension.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.519
Number two, dodgy undertakers.

57:52.520 --> 57:54.479
Re-selling the same coffin
over and over.

57:54.480 --> 57:57.799
Either way, it's not a murder.
So we're off the hook.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.439
And before you moan at me,

57:59.440 --> 58:02.759
go and call the Department
of Works and Pensions.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.840
Them boys are bloodhounds
for this sort of thing.

58:17.880 --> 58:19.240
SHE CHUCKLES

58:21.760 --> 58:23.600
Fancy meeting you here.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.640
How's it going?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.719
Are you any closer
to finding the Prowler?

58:31.720 --> 58:35.640
I feel like we're getting closer,
but he's still out of reach.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.160
You'll catch him.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.279
Ever since the first inquiry,

58:42.280 --> 58:45.119
I've studied serial rapists,

58:45.120 --> 58:47.679
their psychology, their motivation,

58:47.680 --> 58:50.640
and I think I know the Prowler.
There's just one thing...

58:51.640 --> 58:53.359
..I would like to understand.

58:53.360 --> 58:57.319
He steals lipstick from his victims.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.760
I know it's a trophy, but...

58:59.720 --> 59:02.160
..why lipstick?
Why not something else?

59:03.200 --> 59:04.360
Erm...

59:05.480 --> 59:10.480
Well, lipstick can be a way for a
woman to feel powerful, in control.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.999
I know when I'm going out
and I want to feel confident,

59:15.000 --> 59:16.719
there's nothing like a red lip.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.679
War paint.
Yeah, kind of.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.639
I think maybe by taking
the lipstick,

59:21.640 --> 59:24.160
he's trying to take their power,
their agency.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.760
He needs people to suffer
so he can feel strong.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.720
He's a bully.

59:36.880 --> 59:38.960
A little thank you
for being my alibi the other day.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.240
Wear it tonight.

59:44.800 --> 59:47.079
MUSIC PLAYING

59:47.080 --> 59:49.840
PEOPLE CHATTING

59:58.320 --> 1:00:01.479
Leo.
Do you have time for a quick chat?

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.479
I have some thoughts about
your portfolio.

1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:06.840
Yeah, great.
Guys, see you there, OK?

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:13.400
Time to hit the club, people.
Let's go, let's go.

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:18.800
Care to join?

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:28.480
ROLLO INHALES

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.240
Look at us.

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:37.720
Beauty and the beast.

1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:41.239
I said I'd meet everyone
at the club.

1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:43.559
So, I better go.

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.439
We can talk about my portfolio
another time.

1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:48.520
Oh, no rush.
We have lots to discuss.

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:51.520
Yeah. Be a love...

1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:54.000
..undo this knot.

1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:59.119
Oh, I don't know how to massage.
Everyone knows how.

1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:01.680
You just have to get in there
and feel your way.

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:06.960
Come on.

1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:11.000
You have such a bright future.

1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:14.320
I think if we work together...

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:18.320
..you could be a real star.

1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:36.199
Boss. I found something.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:39.839
I can't quite make sense of it.
What is it?

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:41.359
OK, so, the swipe card holder

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:44.279
who took out the victims' statements
from Operation Moonfall

1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:48.119
also removed a statement from
an unconnected investigation.

1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:51.319
It was taken out at the same time as
the Operation Moonfall statements

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.399
and it was also never returned.

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:54.719
What do we know about it?

1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.159
The statement was given by a man
called Pete Cooper in August 2012.

1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:01.559
Who's he?
As far as I can tell,

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:04.399
the Department of Work and Pensions
interviewed him

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.799
when they were looking into
an unidentified body.

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:08.240
Must have been a fraud case.

1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:11.080
Wait, I think I remember this.

1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:16.080
Yeah, we found a burned body.

1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:20.759
And Sid Barrow palmed it off
on the DWP.

1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:23.079
Why would someone go into
cold case storage

1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:26.560
and take statements
from two unrelated inquiries?

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.959
I'm Pete Cooper. How can I help you?

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:43.359
Detective Superintendent Roy Grace.
This is my colleague DS Branson.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.200
Take a seat.
Thank you.

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:56.079
Mr Cooper, ten years ago,
you gave a statement to the police.

1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:57.879
Yes. Yes, I did.

1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:00.719
Can you remember what it was about?
Er...

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:05.079
A PC visited me asking if
we'd had a body go missing.

1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:07.999
Which struck me as a bit
Burke and Hare.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.559
They were talking to all
the local firms, I think,

1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:12.959
looking for a rogue undertaker

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:15.239
who was setting fire to bodies
on the Downs.

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:18.079
Was quite the talk of the pub
for a while.

1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:21.519
If you had nothing to report,
why did you give a statement?

1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:25.839
Ah, I remember. I'd noticed a woman
parked round the back

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:28.359
and I went to tell her
it was private property

1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:29.919
and I had a bad feeling about it.

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:32.319
Cos we keep a lot of valuables
on the premises,

1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:33.999
jewellery belonging to the deceased,

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.279
and I was worried
she might come back.

1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.639
Did she?
No.

1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:41.799
No, but I was that concerned,
I tried checking the CCTV.

1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:44.519
It had glitched that night,
it was all blank.

1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:46.799
Can you describe the woman
you saw that night?

1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:49.599
No. No, it was too dark.

1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.919
Do you know what make of car
she was driving?

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:53.399
No.

1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:55.839
I'm sorry,
I can't remember much else.

1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:58.959
Except that it had been
an emotional night for me,

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:02.639
I'd been preparing
an old friend for burial. Reg.

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:05.799
He used to be an undertaker too
so I was taking special care

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.480
cos I bet he was watching me.

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.679
Reg died of cancer, right?

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:13.080
Yeah.

1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:16.879
Made it to 85
before it got the better of him.

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:20.399
Was he in an open casket?
No, closed.

1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:21.959
And you were the last person
to see him?

1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:23.439
Yeah.

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:27.479
I said a few words, held his hand,
closed the casket and left.

1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:30.799
We buried him the next morning.
Do you have the exact date?

1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:32.280
Yeah, bear with me.

1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:35.120
Er...

1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:39.279
Yeah, 29th of July, 2012.

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:40.880
Up at Woodgrove Cemetery.

1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:50.800
Ten years ago...

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.999
..in the early hours of July 29th,

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.119
we found the body of a man in his
80s burnt to cinders in a barn.

1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:01.119
So you think that burnt body
might be his mate, Reg?

1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:04.239
I also think the woman
who was waiting outside the back

1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:05.519
was involved somehow.

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:07.360
The same woman who waited
for Roxy Harris.

1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:11.040
I think we have to consider that
a distinct possibility, yes.

1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:15.960
So who's been buried in Reg's grave
for the last ten years?

You're choosing cool tones

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:38.119

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:40.599

Don't look at me, thanks.

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:50.960
If you don't want to be looked at,
then why all the slap?

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:53.799
Why the short dress,
why the high heels?

1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:56.839
Everything about you is screaming,
"Look at me." So I'm looking.

1:05:56.840 --> 1:05:58.760

As you were chasing Daisy
through the traffic,

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.280
what were you gonna do
when you got hold of her?

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.320
Make her pay.

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:48.720
What do you mean by that, Johnny?

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:52.839
How do you make girls pay?
Well...

1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:54.279
usually contactless.

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:55.840
What?

1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:00.879
No-one uses cash these days,
they pay me on the app.

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:03.719
I was worried she was gonna stiff me
for the ride

1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:05.199
and give me bad feedback.

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:08.320
Right, and you really expect us
to believe that, do you?

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.480
Do you have any idea
how hard this job is?

1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:18.480
I try to make the experience
as enjoyable as I can.

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:20.840
I keep the car clean.

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:24.159

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:31.919
But they still turn up drunk.

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:36.080
They're sick in the back,
they're abusive, they don't tip.

1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:38.880
Does it make me angry?

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:42.800
Yeah. It does.

1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:47.520
How would you feel if I turned up at
your office and puked all over it?

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:55.600
I bet I could throttle
a confession out of him.

1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:31.679

1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:35.199
A single blow to the skull
from a blunt object.

1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:36.760

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.880
what happened.

Rachel's parents
are gonna be devastated.

1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:04.880

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:26.560

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.639
Pete Cooper thought
he was burying Reginald Matthews

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:52.519
when, in fact,
he was burying Rachel Ryan.

1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.959
We believe that the Prowler's
female accomplice waited

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:57.039
until Pete Cooper
left the funeral parlour

1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:58.439
and then switched the bodies.

1:10:58.440 --> 1:10:59.799
Yeah, but that was a decade ago.

1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:02.239
I'm guessing forensics
aren't gonna be helping out. No.

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:07.519

statements from storage. Yes, boss.

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.959
They knew that if we ever spoke
to Pete Cooper,

1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:12.239
there's a good chance
we'd find Rachel.

But we have no visual on the van.

1:15:57.560 --> 1:15:59.359
OK.

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:02.040
He's just taken a girl
from East Sussex University.

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:05.959
Look. There, there and there.

1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:10.159
OK, so here,
this is where he feels safe.

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:12.439
This is where he hunts.

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.960
Where is he taking her?

No, please, don't let him do this!

This is Rachel Ryan all over again,
isn't it?

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:14.399
Please, I don't wanna die here!

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.559
Stop talking!
Can't we just leave her?

1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:18.279

It's OK. It's all right.

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:55.640

1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:50.920

I won't go through that again.

1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:29.160
I was only 17 when I met Olly.

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:33.879
I thought he was so handsome
and charming.

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:37.319
He took care of me
and it made me feel safe.

1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:40.919
But by the time I realised how...
controlling and...

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:42.920
manipulating he was...

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:46.120
..I was trapped
and too scared to leave.

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:49.440
What happened to Rachel Ryan?

1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:53.640
She saw his face, so he killed her.

1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:56.239
And he promised me...

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:58.440
that if I hid her body
then he'd stop.

1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:02.040
And he was true to his word
for ten years.

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:05.119
And then he started again. Why?

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:06.479
The school reunion.

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:10.399
I begged Oliver not to go,
but he wanted to see Rollo Mercer

1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:13.560
to show him how...
well he was doing.

1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:17.119
And I was terrified
it would trigger Olly, and it did.

1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:19.119
It was like Jekyll and Hyde.

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:22.079
He left as Olly
and he came back a monster.

1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:25.919
Why did seeing Rollo Mercer
have that effect on him?

1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:28.120
Rollo was Olly's abuser.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:32.400
Olly was only nine.

1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:34.520
Rollo must have been...

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:37.520
..14.

1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:41.360
It was devastating.

1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:45.520
Olly never really recovered.
He never...

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:48.280
..felt like a man.

1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:57.560
What about you?
Why did you help him? Why did you...

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:01.359
..stalk those women for him?

1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:04.240
Because he said he'd bury me
with Rachel if I didn't.

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:10.080
He made me wear their lipsticks,
but...

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:13.200
..I never have to
wear lipstick again, do I?

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:24.719
Under my guidance as acting ACC,

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:27.079
the Prowler has been unmasked

1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:29.399
after a decade
of missed opportunity.

1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:31.959
I would like to praise
the inquiry team

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:34.359
for the sensitivity
of their handling

1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:37.279
of this most difficult
and challenging investigation.

1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:40.200
Would you like to add anything,
Detective Superintendent Grace?

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:45.439
I hope the solving of this case
gives people confidence

1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:47.079
that we take every allegation

1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:49.759
of rape and sexual assault
very seriously.

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.799
We have a specialist centre
for victims

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:54.239
and I can promise
the highest standards of care.

1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:56.879
So if you are thinking
of reporting an assault,

1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:59.159
I would urge you to come forward.

may not be the Prowler,

1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:05.879
but he's a nasty piece of work,
all right.

1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:07.839
What are you gonna do?

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:10.680
Just dangle him off the pier
for a bit.

1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:14.920
I haven't done anything.

1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:20.559
I'm here to make sure
it stays that way.

1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:23.919
The way you touch girls
on that ride,

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:25.400
it's not OK.

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:29.760
The way you talk to women
in the cab...

1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:32.359
..it's not OK.

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.080
So you have a choice.

1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:38.919
Change how you behave towards women,

1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:40.800
or we'll be seeing each other again.

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:45.439
Personal visit if you like.
Off the clock.

1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:48.719

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:51.159
and the cold, blue sea.

1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:52.840

What?

1:23:57.560 --> 1:23:59.719
I can't believe you just did that.

1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:03.080
Oh, yeah.
I'm the Batman of Brighton, me.

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:06.760
Come on, let's go get an ice cream
before we head back.

1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:16.720
You wanted to speak to me?
Yeah.

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:20.599
You said you'd take
all sexual assaults seriously.

1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:23.519
Yes. How can I help?

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:26.159
We're here because of Rollo Mercer.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:28.000
Who's the victim, please?

1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:31.160
We all are.

1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:47.600
I've been thinking.

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:50.880
Work is always gonna get in the way.

1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:56.000
And I really...
do not wanna lose what we have.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.280
So I think...

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.239
..the only way we're gonna
be able to see each other

1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:04.680
is if we get our own place.

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:09.960
Our own?

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:14.279
Yeah.
Yeah. Somewhere new just for us.

1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:16.200
A garden.

1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:19.359

..I'd love to, but what about Glenn?

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:33.640
Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine,
I'll have a word with him.

1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:36.800
Are you sure?

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:41.600
One hundred percent.

to the ads about Sandy.

1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:24.639
OK. So, what happens next?

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:27.879
Well, I attend a hearing
before a High Court judge

1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:32.600
and if the claim isn't challenged,
which it won't be, that's that.

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.159
To new futures.

1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:37.960
New futures.

Got something for you.

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.160

1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:05.999
Actually, it's kind of

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.120
OK.

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:14.720
Oh... Yeah.

1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:18.079
You don't know what it is, do you?
Course I know what it is.

1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:19.839
What is it then?
It's a...

1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:22.319
