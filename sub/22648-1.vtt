01:14.520 --> 01:16.760
- Happy birthday.
- Don't.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.800
- What?
- Don't remind me.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.600
It's your 18th birthday. Aren't you happy?

01:20.680 --> 01:22.680
- Yes!
- And it's the day before Halloween.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.682
Yes, all of that is good.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.000
So? What's the problem?

01:26.160 --> 01:29.163
- You wanna see a problem?
- I'll show you a problem.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.207
- Look at him.
- What?

01:33.560 --> 01:34.606
He's so lame.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.201
Hi.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.440
No, it's cute.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.720
He's wearing a birthday hat.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.047
He's excited. It's your birthday.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.881
He does this every year.
Like, when is it gonna end?

01:49.080 --> 01:50.763
Hi, Mr. Simmons.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.767
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.443
Dad. Okay, you've been
doing this every year since I was five.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.360
- Can you stop now?
- What do you mean, can I stop?

02:00.440 --> 02:01.720
This is tradition. We have to do it.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.405
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

02:04.520 --> 02:06.408
Thanks, okay. But can you take off
the stupid hat?

02:06.520 --> 02:08.362
- This hat is not stupid. Come on.
- It's stupid.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.160
Take it off. It's embarrassing.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.209
Okay, all right. Fine. Fine. Fine.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.721
Okay! Now what do you say?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.964
I'm not playing this game with you.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.727
Fine. Then you won't get your gift.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.761
Okay.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.565
Okay, you know what?
On second thought, I'll play.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.409
Yeah, there we go. See? See, I told you.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.330
Here we go, BJ. Here we go.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.566
Dad, what are you doing here?

02:36.280 --> 02:37.963
I just came to pick you up.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.123
Why did you come to pick me up?

02:40.800 --> 02:41.721
No reason.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.601
Wow.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.961
Mmm. She doesn't sound convincing, Dad.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.567
BJ, stay in your lane.
Can I have my gift now?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.283
Well, listen, why don't we
just wait until you get home?

02:51.640 --> 02:52.879
Everybody's at the house.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.446
Can't I just open it now?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.480
Nobody's at the house.
What are you talkin' about?

02:56.560 --> 02:58.004
- Nobody's there.
- What's going on?

02:58.520 --> 03:00.328
My tired after-school birthday party.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.163
Can I please have the gift now?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.760
Fine. Bam! Take it.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.330
- Thank you.
- There you go.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.600
It's headphones. So when we're driving,
I don't have to listen to your music.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.125
You can just plug in
and listen to your own music in my car.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.088
Wait, where's the car?

03:23.640 --> 03:24.527
It's right there.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.200
Mine?

03:27.280 --> 03:29.080
For my 18th birthday?

03:29.160 --> 03:31.760
No, that's mine. You're not getting
a car. What are you talkin' about?

03:31.840 --> 03:34.960
Dad, no. This is the year
I'm supposed to have a car.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.880
I'm graduating high school,
going to college. I'm 18!

03:37.960 --> 03:39.520
Okay. We talked about this.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.800
First of all, you're not
responsible enough to have a car, okay?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.529
And your driving sucks.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.680
Okay, that's... But here's the thing.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.400
If you're gonna have a car,
I think you need to earn it.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.924
I don't think it should be given to you,
okay?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.320
And you haven't earned it. I'm sorry.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.890
Mom lets me drive.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.480
You're not ready for a car, Tiffany.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.000
You have to be responsible.
You have to learn what's going on.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.640
I know your mom probably lets you drive.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.080
But your mom kind of has a bit of an issue.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.604
I heard that.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.523
Damn. Like Candyman.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.040
I didn't mean you weren't,
like, the best judge...

04:07.120 --> 04:08.246
You meant what you said.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.120
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, Mom.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.720
- Hey, baby. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.210
You're welcome.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.200
Hi, Calvin. How you doin'?

04:16.279 --> 04:17.485
- Hi, BJ.
- What's up?

04:18.600 --> 04:19.800
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Okay.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.040
Hi, thank you.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.880
What are you guys doing here?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.082
I knew your dad would be here
with that old hat.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.405
And I knew you'd be humiliated.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.369
So we came to do some damage control.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.600
Happy birthday!

04:29.680 --> 04:31.044
- Mom, what?
- Yes!

04:31.560 --> 04:34.240
Oh, my God! Thank you so much!

04:34.320 --> 04:35.600
You're so welcome.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.040
This is from me and your stepdad.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.359
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

04:38.440 --> 04:40.080
Yeah, go, go. Go for a ride.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.800
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.320
Hey, hey. Don't ruin this for her.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.240
Tiffany, I need you to come home.
You can drive later.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.810
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

04:47.440 --> 04:49.248
For that tired-ass birthday party?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.200
It's a surprise. Do you mind?

04:51.280 --> 04:52.849
You've been doing it for 18 years.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.080
It's not a surprise.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.840
- Go on, baby. Have fun.
- Thank you. Thank you, Calvin.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.250
- Bye!
- You're welcome.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.760
Tiffany, I need you to come straight home.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.960
Bye, Mr. Simmons.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.279
Have fun!

05:04.320 --> 05:05.650
Okay. Did you have to do that?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.440
Well, she's my daughter.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.160
Okay, first of all, you walk out on us.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.760
Then you undermine everything I do.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.640
Then you won't discipline her,
and you walk in here like the hero.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.800
I'm not doing this with you.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.846
You're the one with the problem.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.848
How am I the one with the problem?

05:17.960 --> 05:21.122
She's 18, and you keep treating her
like she's still five.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.360
Look, do not tell me how
to raise this child, okay?

05:23.440 --> 05:26.160
She is not responsible enough
to have a car yet.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.448
You need to learn to give her some room
to make a mistake.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.325
Can we not do this, please?

05:32.080 --> 05:33.600
Can we not? BJ's watchin'.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.760
I'll see you at the house.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you comin' to my house?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.005
What are you comin' to my house for?

05:38.440 --> 05:39.520
It's my daughter.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.169
Get in the car, BJ.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.326
Say hi to your Aunt Madea.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.010
Surprise!

05:52.480 --> 05:53.480
Oh, it's just Brian.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.680
How many times am I supposed
to say "surprise" for this little girl?

05:55.760 --> 05:57.080
Y'all better get her ass up in here.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.809
I don't have breath to be wasting like that.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.280
Hell, I need my breath for when I inhale.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.280
Then you need to stop smoking all that weed.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.520
The devil is a liar.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.329
I'm gonna be smokin' till I die.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.080
Wrap me up in weed paper and cremate me.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.040
I'mma get the whole damn funeral jacked up.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.169
Oh, look at my baby.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.165
Baby, you don't...
You don't look good at all.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.680
No, he don't. What is it, boy?

06:21.760 --> 06:22.999
- Hattie.
- Hmm?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.640
It's you. You the reason why he's not happy.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.680
Bam, slow your roll. Slow your roll.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.284
Brian is into me.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.888
Got me? Brian loves me.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.520
Don't you, boo?

06:34.760 --> 06:37.524
Come on over here,
and let me make you feel good.

06:39.040 --> 06:39.920
Hush all that.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.285
Brian, what is wrong with you?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.360
Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.520
You don't look fine.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.280
Speak up before I hit you in the nut
like I did when you was a little boy.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.200
What is wrong with you?

06:48.280 --> 06:50.200
Yeah. I'm fine. Is everybody here? I'm fine.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.964
Well, just come on over here
and let me give you a hug, Brian.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.121
I'll pass.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.561
Okay, go ahead. Act like that, Brian.

06:56.920 --> 07:01.368
You gonna wish you had
let me make you feel good.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.720
- Mmm.
- Damn.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.040
Your breath came out your mouth
ass-backwards.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.120
It was breech.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.520
What the hell is that?

07:10.600 --> 07:11.880
Joe, you smell it too?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.000
I'm sitting right here by her.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.760
Hell, that damn thing came over here,

07:14.840 --> 07:16.842
walked past me like, "I'm funky."

07:17.320 --> 07:18.720
Oh, y'all shut the hell up.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.200
Girl, that breath smell like
it's been in the Civil War.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.407
Girl, you need to just
bottle that up and sell it.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.360
That cleared up all my sinuses.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.919
Anytime somebody got breath
like that, honey, that bad,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.280
something is going on inside.
That ain't just your teeth.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.884
That's her esophagus.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.640
It's down, way down there,
below her belly button.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.007
No, Bam, it's comin' lower
than her esophagus.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.889
That's comin' from down low.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.520
Y'all shut the hell up. You shut up, Joe.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.283
I know damn well you ain't talkin' to me.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.440
I know when my breath smell.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.807
If my breath smell bad, it's 'cause
of what I've been eating. Hello?

07:49.080 --> 07:50.160
Joe, cut it out.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.009
Where's Tiffany, boy?
I thought you went to get her.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.168
Well, I did. I went to get her.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.204
And her mother and her husband were there,
and they bought her a car.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.486
They bought a car?

08:00.400 --> 08:01.321
A real one?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.520
Wait, hold on. They gave her a car for free?

08:03.600 --> 08:04.646
She didn't have to work for it?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.560
That's... You see,
that's exactly what I'm saying.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.840
Exactly what I'm saying.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.480
Oh, hell no, honey. No.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.529
Do you know how much work I had to do
to get my first car?

08:13.120 --> 08:15.320
Oh, I had to walk up and down them streets.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.200
My heels was run over just like this

08:17.280 --> 08:19.120
'cause I was walkin' and workin' them
streets so hard.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.120
Oh, that's not what I'm saying.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.320
That is not what I'm saying.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.240
No, no. They say...

08:23.320 --> 08:25.640
They say like people's pets
start to look like them...

08:25.720 --> 08:27.840
I'mma tell you right now,
if you give up too much ass,

08:27.920 --> 08:30.040
your ass start to look like
whatever you gave it up for.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.520
That's why this ass look like
a Buick Electra 225.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
You see that shit, right there?

08:34.600 --> 08:35.679
That's gonna make me throw up.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.240
Madea, I'm not talking
about that. Okay? Thanks.

08:39.320 --> 08:44.320
So, baby, so, you said that
they bought her a car for "pree"?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.686
- For what?
- A car for "pree."

08:47.320 --> 08:50.289
Ain't no P-R in "free," honey. "Free. Free."

08:50.680 --> 08:52.920
Not one dime
did she have to pay for it. Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.080
I was pimpin' hard to get my first Cadillac.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.280
I had so many hoes out on the street,

08:57.360 --> 08:58.520
I couldn't even keep count.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.807
I had every ho from every nation.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.128
Yeah, they used to call me NATO.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.520
What do you mean, "NATO"?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.840
You don't know
what the hell NATO is? Damn, Bam.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.120
NATO. I'm the National Pimp Association

09:11.200 --> 09:12.960
that tolerates all the old hoes.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.920
- Oh!
- Yeah, NATO.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.520
What the hell?

09:16.600 --> 09:17.520
Hush all of that.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.400
Well, baby, a car is a nice thing
even though she got it for free.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.482
No, it's not. It's not a nice thing.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.640
Why not?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.801
She's not responsible. Tiffany can't drive.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.564
Duh, Brian.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.445
You supposed to teach her
how to drive, honey.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.520
I tried to teach her. I tried to teach her.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.680
What did she do?

09:34.800 --> 09:35.960
I was teaching her how to parallel park.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.360
I said, "Put it in reverse
and back up," she hit a tree.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.319
She hit a tree? Why?

09:40.520 --> 09:42.800
I said, "Why'd you do that?"
She said, "I didn't hear the beeps."

09:42.880 --> 09:44.119
Oh, yeah.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.405
What you talkin' about, "Oh, yeah"?

09:45.520 --> 09:46.850
What do you know about a damn beep?

09:47.080 --> 09:50.128
Mabel, the new cars nowadays...
She don't know.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.160
New cars nowadays, honey,

09:52.240 --> 09:54.760
they beep when you start going
backwards, baby.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.966
That's all, honey.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.084
But you wouldn't know nothin' about that
'cause you ain't got no nice car.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.880
She done went off on you
about your raggedy-ass car.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.240
You ain't talkin' about my Cadillac.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.480
My Cadillac is special.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.163
I worked hard for that Cadillac.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.320
That pole was bent when I leapt up off of it,

10:08.400 --> 10:10.240
working for that Cadillac. Do you understand?

10:10.320 --> 10:12.200
I didn't have them
kind of poles back in my day.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.280
Them silver, gold ones.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.560
They had telephone poles,
and I snapped it one night

10:15.640 --> 10:17.004
when I was doing my somersault.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.610
It's called a helicopter.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.080
Where you run up to it, and you grab it
by the bottom of your legs,

10:21.160 --> 10:22.286
then you come on down.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.960
That's what I did.
That's what bought my Cadillac.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
Don't talk about my Cadillac.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.320
And listen to me, my car is nice too.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.720
If I'm backing up and I'm about to hit
somethin', I hear noise too.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.608
It's from the bastard I'm about to hit.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.840
Okay, and so now, what did you buy her?

10:35.920 --> 10:38.280
Wait, that's a good question, Bam.
What'd you give her?

10:38.360 --> 10:41.200
I know you got somethin'
that just wiped her out here.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.929
You ain't gonna let her outdo you.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.129
If she got a car, what you got?

10:47.120 --> 10:48.359
I bought her some headphones.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.321
I'm sorry.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.480
Headphones like you put on your ears?

10:58.560 --> 10:59.481
That's what I...

11:00.280 --> 11:01.201
Yes.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.160
Oh, Brian.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.368
Now, don't you think that... that...
that made your little gift look like...

11:08.480 --> 11:09.367
Shit.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.720
I was going to say that,
but I was gonna say, "bull squat."

11:12.800 --> 11:14.680
Boy, what the hell wrong with you?

11:14.760 --> 11:16.880
You're just... You're just a dork.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.440
"Here's your car." "Here's your headphones."

11:19.920 --> 11:22.760
That's the same thing I said!

11:22.840 --> 11:24.720
He's full of it if he thinks...

11:24.800 --> 11:27.320
Where you goin'?
Come on, we wanna see the headphones!

11:27.400 --> 11:29.160
Keep the phone, just give me the head.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.560
<i># Break the windows, ride, ride, ride #</i>

11:36.640 --> 11:38.240
Tiffany, look out!

11:38.320 --> 11:39.280
Can you slow down?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.480
I'm so excited! Aren't you excited?

11:40.560 --> 11:41.640
That was a red light.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.800
<i># Love is in the air, hey, hey #</i>

11:43.880 --> 11:46.720
<i># Ride, ride, ride, break the windows #</i>

11:46.800 --> 11:48.449
Oh, I love this car.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, it's a nice car.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.365
But your dad was right. You can't drive.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.840
Yes, I can.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.445
Uh, yeah. See,
the thing is you actually can't.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.800
Wait, what are we doing here?

11:58.560 --> 11:59.480
It's called a do-over.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.720
What's a "do-over"?

12:01.240 --> 12:04.720
See, last year I was too young
to come to the Halloween party.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.920
But this year, I'm gonna be the life of it.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.400
- No, no, no. This is not a good idea.
- Yes!

12:09.480 --> 12:10.560
- No. Nope.
- Oh, okay, you...

12:10.640 --> 12:13.480
You think everything is a bad idea.
You need to live a little.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.880
No. Because I am not letting
you get me into trouble

12:15.960 --> 12:17.400
like you did with Aday last year!

12:17.480 --> 12:18.520
Come on!

12:18.600 --> 12:20.960
No! No, no. Your dad got so mad,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.960
Aday's dad was furious,
and Madea got everyone into trouble,

12:24.040 --> 12:25.404
and the cops were called.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.240
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- No. Nope.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.080
No, yes, you're doing this with me.
We're doing this together.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.640
We're best friends.
We're gonna do it. Come on.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.084
Oops, sorry.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.324
Not gonna like this.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.080
Wait! Your dad is not gonna like this.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.360
I don't care! I'm an adult. I'm 18.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.770
He doesn't have to like it.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.200
- Aren't you excited?
- No.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.600
- Be excited. It'll be fun.
- No...

12:47.680 --> 12:48.680
- I don't wanna go.
- Come on!

12:53.960 --> 12:54.847
Who is it?

12:55.440 --> 12:56.361
It's a surprise!

12:57.040 --> 12:57.960
Whoa. Whoa.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.320
Back up!

12:59.400 --> 13:00.520
What is wrong with you?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.363
What's with all the cloak-and-dagger?

13:02.600 --> 13:06.081
Just being careful, you know? Do I know you?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.650
Well...

13:09.160 --> 13:11.082
No. Missed me with that.
I ain't the father, all right?

13:11.920 --> 13:13.600
Um, is Jonathan here?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.124
Oh. He ain't the father either.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.720
I do know you. Okay.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, you're the 17-year-old charlatan.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.400
Go ahead, take a hike, you rug rat.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.600
Look, I just wanna talk to Jonathan.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.124
Jonathan don't live here no more.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.520
All right? He moved to Shanghai.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.283
- Dino.
- No Dino here.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.404
I am the security of this fraternity.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.360
Right here, you see these toasters?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.804
Make bread, heat it up.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.201
Dino, come on.
The guest list isn't gonna write itself.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.200
Oh, can I get on it? Hi. How are you?

13:41.280 --> 13:44.169
Hey! Yeah, I'm not talking to you.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.560
- Why not?
- Oh, I don't know.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.640
'Cause last time I checked, you're 17.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.848
Oh, well, last time I checked,
I just turned 18.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.000
Really? She's 18?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.843
Don't fall for it, dude. She's a temptress.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.960
- Yeah.
- I just wanted to apologize

14:01.040 --> 14:02.530
for last year, all right?

14:03.160 --> 14:06.880
And I wanted to see if we could
get invited to this Halloween party.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.643
"Oh, boo-hoo, I wanted to apologize."

14:08.960 --> 14:11.724
Yeah, you're the reason we can't have
a Halloween party this year.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.409
- What?
- Yeah, we can't have a party this year.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.080
You just said you were
working on the guest list.

14:17.160 --> 14:21.280
Well, yeah, but we can't have a party here
at the frat house anymore.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.009
Why not? Because of me?

14:23.360 --> 14:24.486
No, 'cause of global warming.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.001
Yeah, 'cause of you.

14:26.360 --> 14:30.200
It's because of your dad
and his old gangster friends.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.840
Okay, look. She's sorry.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.523
No party. Okay, cool. Let's go, okay?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.240
- Bye, guys, see you later.
- But see, the thing is...

14:35.320 --> 14:36.160
Adiós.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.924
...my birthday's today,
Halloween is tomorrow.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.162
I'm just sad that
I messed it up for you guys.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.641
I'm sorry.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.401
Bro.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.644
ID. Fork it over. Come here.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.963
- Put it right there. All right, let's see.
- There you go.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.844
- Wow.
- Is she?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.649
- I'm not good at math.
- She's definitely hot.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.484
What do you say, 18 now?

14:58.840 --> 14:59.806
- Eighteen.
- Fake.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.769
Probably. It's all right.
Whatever. I don't care.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.161
Here you go.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.449
I just wish I could make it up to you.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.240
She just gonna throw it at you like that?

15:11.320 --> 15:12.764
No, she's not talking about it like that.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.569
Sounds like she was to me.

15:16.880 --> 15:17.801
You're so gross.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.528
I just hate that you guys aren't having
a party this year.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.480
You know, I could show you guys that I...

15:23.560 --> 15:24.799
I actually know how to have fun.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.360
Well...

15:27.440 --> 15:29.169
Don't do it, dude. I'll do it.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.720
- Don't do what?
- Whatever he's saying not to do.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.160
- I don't know.
- What is that?

15:33.240 --> 15:35.320
We are having a party!

15:35.400 --> 15:37.640
I know. I knew you were just kidding.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.680
What time should I be here?

15:38.760 --> 15:40.284
Oh, it's not here.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
- No?
- Nope.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.167
It's at Lake Derrick.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.686
What?

15:46.680 --> 15:47.806
- Yep.
- Bingo.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.089
Are... Where the people
got killed making out?

15:52.880 --> 15:53.720
Yep.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.000
Are you crazy?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.729
Oh, my God. This is gonna be so much fun.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.843
Tell that to the people
who died there. It's not fun.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.928
Yeah, you can't. 'Cause they're dead.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.560
Look, it's gonna be super creepy and scary.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.448
- But that's why it's gonna be lit!
- Yup.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.320
You're gonna regret this, bro.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.000
And for that reason, I'm in.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.925
- And that's why it's gonna be epic!
- Epic!

16:16.040 --> 16:16.961
Epic!

16:17.520 --> 16:19.120
Dude, what are you doing here?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.320
Seriously, dude, you're like 40.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.440
Just graduate.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.400
- Um, what time should I be there?
- Do you know how to get to Lake Derrick?

16:25.480 --> 16:28.600
No, but I have a car
that has a GPS and Gabriella...

16:28.680 --> 16:30.120
- Gabriella won't.
- ...will be there.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.920
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.603
- It'll be fun!
- No, no. Are you crazy?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.320
Have you not learned your lesson already?

16:35.400 --> 16:36.560
I'm not hanging around dead people.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.200
All right, look. I'll text the
instructions on how to get there tonight.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.320
Alongside a shirtless selfie
that I took this morning

16:43.400 --> 16:45.970
and only sent to two other girls
that you can save as your wallpaper.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.400
We'll see you at midnight.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.320
- Midnight?
- Yeah.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.641
We start at 12:01 on Halloween.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
I'm not about to go to this right now.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.279
- Okay? Come on.
- See you there!

16:58.520 --> 17:00.680
<i>Stalker alert! Stalker alert!
Stalker alert! Everyone!</i>

17:00.760 --> 17:02.120
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

17:02.200 --> 17:04.000
I will not bitch out. I will not bitch out.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.405
Bae!

17:08.640 --> 17:09.480
- Bae!
- Anna!

17:09.560 --> 17:11.880
Baby! Bae!

17:11.960 --> 17:14.530
- Anna, calm down.
- Anna! Anna!

17:14.839 --> 17:15.761
Anna!

17:15.880 --> 17:16.839
Why are you here?

17:16.920 --> 17:18.522
We were just getting invited to the...

17:18.640 --> 17:21.563
Library! To the library
with books and knowledge.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.406
Are you guys lying to me, huh?

17:23.520 --> 17:24.800
- No.
- You guys are lying to me.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.440
No, there's knowledge in books
which are at the library.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.840
How are you? Great parking job.
You crushed that.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.841
Where's Horse?

17:31.160 --> 17:33.207
Uh, probably shirtless,
taking a selfie in the bathroom

17:33.320 --> 17:34.525
and stroking his hair?

17:35.640 --> 17:36.561
Where's Jonathan?

17:37.680 --> 17:39.204
Right next to him, high-fiving?

17:40.040 --> 17:42.246
Where's Mikey, where's Byron,
where's my boyfriend? Where's everybody?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.163
Anna, why are you here?

17:44.600 --> 17:47.680
I've been calling Horse every single day,
day in and day out.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.489
He won't respond, and I wanna know why.

17:49.920 --> 17:50.841
Well...

17:51.240 --> 17:54.448
I texted him 25 times in the last 30 minutes.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.005
Just three bubbles.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.561
What does that mean?
Somebody tell me what that means.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.090
You have really strong thumbs?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.080
There he is. Baby!

18:04.160 --> 18:06.240
- Anna!
- Anna! Stop!

18:12.640 --> 18:14.120
Surprise!

18:14.200 --> 18:16.400
It's just me. Everybody calm down. Calm down.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.244
Do you kids mind?
Mind let us talk for a second?

18:20.080 --> 18:21.800
Looks like you need to calm down.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.246
Yeah, it's this divorce.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.919
Is it that bad?

18:26.040 --> 18:27.360
I've been telling you about it
for years, man.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.640
Yeah, it's that bad. She is that bad.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.160
And be glad that your daughter loves you.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.880
Come on. Tiffany loves you too.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.644
She tolerates me, man.
There's a difference. She tolerates me.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.960
It's all teenagers.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.000
Teenagers. Yeah. Okay.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.720
But how'd you get yours to be so responsible?

18:39.800 --> 18:43.360
Well, me and Liz, we sit down,
give her a little space.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.679
Sometimes, space works.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.960
Yeah, well, she's got all the space
in the world now. You know why?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.121
Her mother bought her a car.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.561
Just bought her a car.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.120
She's not responsible enough
to have a car. This woman...

18:53.200 --> 18:54.963
You just need to sit down and talk with her.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.360
It'll work out.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.800
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's a car!

18:57.880 --> 19:00.325
Yeah. Thanks, Dr. Phil.
Finish eating that dip.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.720
Damn.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.405
That's a nice little sports car
they done bought her. It's red.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.090
Red, that means fire.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.642
Bought her what looks
like a nice little car out there.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.360
Debrah bought her a nice car.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.520
You bought her some headphones.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.760
Why you let that ho do that to you?

19:17.840 --> 19:19.440
Do not say that about my ex-wife, okay?

19:19.520 --> 19:21.080
I don't want my son to hear that.
She's not a ho.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.641
Ex-wife, old ho. Same thing.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.441
Hear me good when I say this
to your ignorant ass, boy!

19:28.960 --> 19:33.169
You don't let no ex-ho
show you up to your child.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.566
You handle that! Do you understand?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.760
Listen to what I'm saying. Call her up.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.240
Do your pimp voice like
I used to do back in the day.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
"Look here, ho."

19:44.920 --> 19:47.360
That was my pimp voice. It had to be higher

19:47.440 --> 19:49.601
so when you hit 'em low,
they didn't know what was comin'.

19:49.880 --> 19:50.760
You understand?

19:50.840 --> 19:53.000
She bought a car,
all you gotta do is walk up to her,

19:53.080 --> 19:56.680
"You don't buy my daughter no damn car
unless I say it's okay.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.207
You better take this car back
wherever the hell you got it from

20:00.400 --> 20:02.322
or I'mma kick your ass!

20:02.880 --> 20:05.200
You finna take this car back.
Your raggedy ass...

20:05.280 --> 20:06.680
I shouldn't have married
you in the first damn..."

20:06.760 --> 20:07.726
Excuse me?

20:09.720 --> 20:11.608
Damn, she showed up
like Candyman, didn't she?

20:12.440 --> 20:14.123
Same thing I said.

20:14.960 --> 20:15.881
What did you say?

20:16.040 --> 20:19.282
I said, "Hey, baby, how you doin'?"

20:20.560 --> 20:21.481
I'm fine.

20:22.240 --> 20:26.039
You know, it's always good to see you.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.406
Daddy?

20:28.720 --> 20:30.767
You had the pony.
You didn't have the stallion.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.366
Yeah, right. Come on, Calvin.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.560
So, uh, who the hell is this?

20:39.640 --> 20:42.848
Hattie, that's her new husband.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.768
Oh, that's how y'all rollin' now?

20:46.280 --> 20:48.043
That's how y'all doin' things?

20:48.320 --> 20:51.084
You just gonna bring your piece up
and all through here?

20:51.240 --> 20:52.161
That's how you go?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.640
That's what the young folks do now.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.164
That's how they all do.

20:56.600 --> 21:01.162
Well, back in the day,
you would have got your ass whooped.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.083
Let me make sure I understand this.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.201
Boy.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.921
Boy.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.170
You gonna stand there

21:10.440 --> 21:14.080
and let this girl
bring this nigga up in your house?

21:14.160 --> 21:15.843
Joe, watch your darn mouth, hush!

21:16.200 --> 21:20.682
Have you ever in your life known anybody
that was able to watch their own mouth?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.320
I bet you if I pulled your darn eyes out,

21:22.400 --> 21:24.440
and turn them around have them look
at your darn lips, you'll see 'em.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.089
I can't watch my darn mouth.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.528
I can't see it. That's ignorant.
Just shut up, Mabel. Hell.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.040
Do you see my mouth? I can't see it.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.723
Joe, shut the hell up. Just shut up.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.564
Close your legs.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.725
I know she can't close them legs.
You know why? Nuts.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.600
You wanna see something funny? Watch this.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.680
Hi, Calvin.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.806
He never talks to me.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.170
He ain't gonna say nothin' back to you?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.240
He don't speak to you
when you in your own house

21:55.320 --> 21:56.764
and you won't set it straight?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.726
That's all you got to say?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.525
You don't let no woman bring
no man up in your house!

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
Beat his ass!

22:03.600 --> 22:06.489
Daddy, we are not those kind of people.
We are people with class.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.360
Bitch, did you hear one word that I said?

22:09.440 --> 22:13.330
Class? We ain't never have no damn class.
We didn't even go to class.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.923
Calvin, this is my father, Joe.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.880
Hi, Mr. Joe.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.840
Nigga, don't freakin' talk to me!
I don't know you like that, mothertrucker!

22:23.920 --> 22:25.360
Joe, shut the hell up.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.880
You are ruining my son's life.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.609
Look at him, standin' there lookin' like a...

22:30.800 --> 22:32.720
Daddy, that's enough.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.440
Don't you damn say
no damn "Daddy" to me here.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.200
- This woman...
- Joe, hush up!

22:37.280 --> 22:39.320
You better watch your daughter
'cause she gonna be just like her.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.480
- Ain't gonna be shit either.
- Joe.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.640
Hello.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.880
Oh, there she is!

22:43.960 --> 22:47.202
Surprise!

22:47.480 --> 22:48.526
She's here!

22:49.080 --> 22:51.120
Oh, hell. Surprise, then!

22:51.200 --> 22:52.640
- Get on out my damn way.
- Oh, my.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.641
Move!

22:55.600 --> 22:56.407
I need a joint.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.120
S-Surprise!

22:58.200 --> 22:59.769
- Surprise!
- Thanks.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.806
Oh, babe, I was gonna get you somethin',

23:03.360 --> 23:05.680
but my check was late, and I, I...

23:06.160 --> 23:09.208
But my heart was in the right place.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.321
Thank you.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.839
You surprised?

23:13.360 --> 23:15.560
Baby, you don't look too surprised
to see us sittin' here

23:15.640 --> 23:16.970
after I done drove all the way over here

23:17.080 --> 23:18.683
to this part of town
with no driver's license.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.569
You need to at least look surprised.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.763
Well, I had a feeling you'd be here

23:22.880 --> 23:25.121
'cause it's the same people every year.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.920
Well, I mean, that's stupid.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.366
You have a birthday every year,
what you expect?

23:29.480 --> 23:33.484
Okay, somebody... somebody better get her.
Y'all better get her.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.080
Hey, Tiffany, come here!

23:35.160 --> 23:36.960
Look who's here! Look who's here!

23:37.040 --> 23:38.370
Look, your friends.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.569
From elementary school.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.170
Even I don't deal with them.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.801
I'm gonna put some music on.
This is gonna be so great.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.206
BJ, put the music on.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.680
- Hi!
- Hi, you're here too?

23:48.760 --> 23:49.965
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.400
Your dad called me like ten times.
So I had to come.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.163
I'm sorry, he does this every year.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
Yeah, it's cute.

23:58.080 --> 23:58.967
Hi, girls.

23:59.160 --> 24:00.286
- Hi!
- Hi, Mr. Victor!

24:00.680 --> 24:02.363
You guys are growin' up so quickly.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.602
Dad, would you stop? You're so embarrassing.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.880
He's so hot.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.643
You have a thing with dads,

24:10.760 --> 24:12.523
- and I'm worried for you.
- So what? It's just a little thing.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.048
Anyways, I'm so glad
you're here, 'cause I was gonna call you.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.601
- Why, what's up?
- There's a party tonight.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.761
Where?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.206
Um, well,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.290
it's at Lake Derrick.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.240
The frat boys are having another party,

24:25.320 --> 24:27.162
but it's my year to turn up!

24:27.800 --> 24:29.760
My parents are gonna kill me if I tell them.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.682
Don't worry about it. I have a plan.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.761
Oh, I gotta hear this.

24:33.880 --> 24:34.880
All right, all right.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.240
Time for the father-daughter dance.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.440
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Dad, no, no. Come on!

24:39.520 --> 24:42.040
- Do the Fire Hydrant, do the Fire Hydrant.
- What is the Fire Hydrant?

24:42.120 --> 24:43.520
It's the dog... Do the Fire Hydrant.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.647
Do the Sprinkler.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.880
Do the Toilet Seat. Do the Toilet Seat.

24:47.960 --> 24:51.000
Oh, baby, how come we can't dance like that?

24:51.080 --> 24:52.760
Because that's embarrassing.
I'm not doing that.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.888
- Just one.
- No. No, no.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.440
- Come on, dance.
- No, I don't wanna dance, Dad.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.560
Get it, get it, get it. Get it, get it.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.000
Oh, get it, get it. He done told you.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.440
Come on. Get it, get it, get it.
Come on, girl!

25:08.200 --> 25:10.840
What up, what up? Get your donk on.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.640
Get your donkey whipped.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.840
Look at that! Uh, uh, uh.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.320
Yeah, girl. Go.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.000
I can't do this. I'm gonna go get some water.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.480
Oh.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.080
You're not enjoying
your party, are you, baby?

25:21.160 --> 25:22.923
No, I'm not.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.560
- It's okay.
- Brian, that girl's so damn rude.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.210
- I could just kill her!
- Okay, all right. Okay.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.040
And pass it.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.201
Pass it back, pass it.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.880
- Take it, take it!
- Okay. All right, sure.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.520
You know what? This party is bunk.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.607
Mom, please.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.684
I know you're not happy.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.640
So tonight, I think you should let Calvin
and I take you to dinner.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.440
That sounds great,
but I got invited to a Halloween party.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.680
Halloween is tomorrow.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.999
But the party starts tonight.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.843
What? All night?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.920
Now you know your daddy will not...

25:58.000 --> 26:00.286
I know, but maybe...

26:00.600 --> 26:03.280
I was thinking,
I could spend the night at your place

26:03.360 --> 26:04.520
and you could just let me go.

26:06.360 --> 26:10.120
You know what? That's a good idea.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.160
I mean, you're 18!

26:11.240 --> 26:12.560
- You're grown! Yes!
- Yeah!

26:12.640 --> 26:15.000
So will you tell him or will I?

26:15.080 --> 26:16.280
Oh, no, no. Let me tell him.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.840
You know I love getting under his skin.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.000
Okay!

26:21.360 --> 26:22.800
Almost sundown. You know what that means!

26:22.880 --> 26:27.280
Pin the tail on the donkey call!

26:27.360 --> 26:28.884
And you know what else we gonna do?

26:29.280 --> 26:30.519
I got a petting zoo outside.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.560
A freakin' petting zoo outside.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.609
You are not going to believe this.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
I don't believe it.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.520
- Come on, come see!
- It's a petting zoo.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.521
I'm sorry.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.200
This is a birthday party for an 18-year-old.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.720
Shit, Brian ought to be ashamed of himself.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.642
It's so lame. He ought to feel bad.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.330
Yeah, hell yeah, it's lame.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.680
This girl don't bit mo' wanna be here
than the man in the moon.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.524
Hey. When I think about a man in the moon...

26:57.000 --> 27:00.720
You got one hell of a moon on you.
Have you ever seen it? It's full.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.520
And here we go! Here we go!

27:07.600 --> 27:09.283
Look what I have for you!

27:09.960 --> 27:11.563
Look, a petting zoo!

27:12.280 --> 27:13.406
A petting zoo?

27:14.880 --> 27:17.640
Hi. This is Rose and Renee.
They were in the circus

27:17.720 --> 27:19.600
and they are a part of the petting zoo.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.640
They have these horses for you!

27:21.720 --> 27:22.959
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:23.040 --> 27:23.920
We'll be out here when you're ready.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.200
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.840
You used to love this when you were little.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.159
Yeah, when I was four.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.440
<i># Number one in a hot party show
Now push it #</i>

27:32.520 --> 27:34.169
Lord, what the hell Hattie doing?

27:34.720 --> 27:35.959
Look at her.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.530
- Joe!
- Look at that!

27:38.920 --> 27:41.320
Watch it. Her knee's gonna
go out in a minute.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.840
<i># Push it good, ah, push it #</i>

27:46.320 --> 27:49.084
How you know her knee was gonna lock up, Joe?

27:51.520 --> 27:53.681
- That's nasty, Joe.
- That's how I know.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.560
Time for this, here. I'm too old for this.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.040
That hurt like a son of a...

28:03.920 --> 28:05.240
He ought to feel bad.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.969
Bought that child some headphones.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.680
Brian, you did a good job, baby.
You did a good job with this party.

28:11.760 --> 28:12.726
You did a good job.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.960
I don't feel like I did a good job.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.920
Baby, she loved this party. She loved it.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.400
Don't be lyin' to this boy.
He ain't do no damn good job.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.000
That girl out there miserable.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.080
Joe, shut the hell up.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.720
Son, if you gonna throw
a party for an 18-year-old,

28:25.800 --> 28:27.240
there's some things you need.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.880
You got balloons and confetti and blow...

28:31.120 --> 28:32.928
Eighteen-year-olds want drugs.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.407
Ain't no 18-year-olds supposed
to be doin' no drugs.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.800
What the hell you talking about?

28:36.880 --> 28:39.246
I, I was doing drugs
since I was eight years old.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.601
And that's how you turned out
as stupid as hell.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.849
I may not be able to remember nothin'...

28:44.200 --> 28:47.328
My brain might be fried, all I know is...

28:51.080 --> 28:52.001
I don't know.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.170
It was nice, Brian.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.640
You know you lyin'. This party was suckin'.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.959
Come on, I'll help you clean up.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.600
Well, that's my cue to go.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.363
Bam, you rode here with me.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.727
How the hell you gonna go anywhere?
Come on, let's go clean up.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.526
- Mabel...
- Stop being so darn lazy.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.121
Lazy?

29:09.720 --> 29:12.840
Now wait a minute, Mabel.
I may be a lot of things,

29:12.920 --> 29:15.040
but lazy ain't one of 'em.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.167
And you know I had hip surgery.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.760
What that got to do with anything?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.920
Mabel, the doctor said I can't have no sex

29:21.000 --> 29:24.520
and I cannot stand up
for long periods of time, honey.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.810
I actually like it standing up.

29:28.920 --> 29:29.841
Like horses.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.120
Shut the hell up, all this.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.000
Come on, y'all, come on,
let's go on in the kitchen.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.001
Mabel...

29:38.120 --> 29:39.530
Thank you, Madea.

29:39.760 --> 29:40.760
Mabel...

29:40.880 --> 29:42.324
You wanna get paid, don't you?

29:42.600 --> 29:45.762
You're right I want some money.
Hell, I don't do no services for free.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.640
- I don't think this is cool at all.
- Ugh.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.080
Stop, all right?
You're coming and it's gonna be fun.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.000
Tell your dad you're staying
at my mom's place.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.760
- Okay.
- We're gonna have a blast!

29:54.840 --> 29:57.760
- Yeah.
- I'm so excited! Aren't you excited?

29:57.840 --> 30:00.600
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do
to make Tiffany happy. I have no idea.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.040
Teenagers. I've been through it, man.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.359
With Gabriella? No.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.123
- No, with my other kids.
- Oh.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.880
Gabriella? She's been nothing but a delight.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.600
Hmm. That's good, man.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.880
Tiffany was a delight too, when she was one.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.565
It gets better. It gets better.
It takes time.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.400
Yeah, okay. If you say so.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.600
She's 18. How much more time? I've been...

30:19.680 --> 30:22.080
Feels like I'm in prison. I don't know
how many years I gotta do this.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.080
That's all right. I'm throwing
away one or two things.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.920
That's all I'm gonna do. Come on.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.960
Your mom is seriously the coolest.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.480
Oh, thank you.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.481
And get this,

30:31.840 --> 30:33.280
she's letting us go to the party.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.440
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

30:35.360 --> 30:36.770
Wait, will your parents know?

30:37.240 --> 30:40.480
Well, they'll know
that we'll be at your place.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.400
- Tiffany.
- Come on, Mom!

30:42.480 --> 30:44.800
You're so cool! Please.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.040
Okay. All right.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.560
But you have to promise to be responsible.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.480
- We will.
- Yeah.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.084
- We will, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.530
Wait, hold on. Where's this party?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.360
You won't get mad, right?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.841
You're 18. No.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.280
It's at Lake Derrick.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.400
Lake Derrick?

30:59.480 --> 31:00.924
It's a haunted Halloween party.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.600
Oh. Well, this sounds fun.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.919
Yeah.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.360
So you're gonna let us go?

31:07.200 --> 31:08.121
Hmm.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.880
Yeah, you can go.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.320
You're only young once, honey.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.920
You shouldn't be sittin' here
with a petting zoo.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.280
- You know?
- Yeah, you're right.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.800
So go, have fun.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.800
- But be careful.
- We will.

31:18.880 --> 31:19.720
Yeah, we will.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.880
- All right.
- You're the best.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.962
- I love you.
- I love you.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.488
I know this girl ain't not have said...

31:27.920 --> 31:29.560
I know this girl did not just come out here

31:29.640 --> 31:30.970
and say what I thought she just said.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.839
Now, I know y'all didn't just hear that.
You ain't hear?

31:33.920 --> 31:35.125
- What?
- Hear what?

31:35.440 --> 31:36.566
Who said this? What'd they say?

31:37.040 --> 31:38.640
That girl back there, her mama...

31:38.720 --> 31:42.200
Debrah's gonna let her go down
to Lake Derrick for a party.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.400
- Mabel!
- Yes!

31:43.480 --> 31:44.880
Down there where them children died?

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
All of them people got killed.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.400
She's gonna let
her go down there for some party.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.520
What the hell they going down there for?

31:49.600 --> 31:52.320
I just said, a party.
A Halloween party, Hattie.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.000
Why do these children insist

31:55.080 --> 31:56.840
on playing around with the devil these days?

31:56.920 --> 31:58.560
You tell me, honey. You tell me.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.200
- Does Brian know?
- No, he does not know.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.361
I'm sure gonna tell him,
soon as we finish cleaning up in here.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.520
I was about to say...

32:03.600 --> 32:05.000
Soon as we finish cleaning up in here.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.760
- I was about to say...
- Soon as we...

32:07.840 --> 32:09.880
You know what? I'll do it my damn self.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.326
- I ain't gonna be able to help.
- I'll do it my damn self...

32:24.560 --> 32:25.799
- So...
- Okay, Dad, I'm off.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.406
- You're off?
- Yeah.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.560
Where you going?

32:28.640 --> 32:30.004
She's coming with me to my house.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.081
Why?

32:32.400 --> 32:34.970
Because we wanna have a nice dinner
with her for her birthday.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.040
Okay, great. I'll get my keys.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.720
Well, no, no. You're not invited.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.244
She wants to spend the weekend with us.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.210
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.768
All right, fine. Um...

32:51.160 --> 32:52.081
Well, be careful.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.240
Okay, I will.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.960
- And I love you.
- I love you too.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.848
All right. No driving after dark.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.560
No, I won't.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.280
And it's Halloween, so be careful.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.486
I will. Bye.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.081
Hey, Dad.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.160
Um, Tiffany's having
a sleepover at her mom's.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.161
Can I go?

33:09.840 --> 33:10.880
Well...

33:10.960 --> 33:12.245
Come on, you know you can trust me.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.359
Okay. Okay.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.720
- Thanks, Dad.
- You better make sure you call me though,

33:18.800 --> 33:20.039
- as soon as you get there.
- I will.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.160
Okay.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.080
Bye, Mr. Simmons. Rad party.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.081
Really?

33:24.920 --> 33:26.967
- Ah, hold on, hold on.
- Yes?

33:27.480 --> 33:29.004
Ain't there somethin'
that you wanna tell Brian?

33:30.080 --> 33:31.001
No.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.446
- Debrah...
- What?

33:33.040 --> 33:34.723
- Yes, there is.
- What?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.800
Debrah, don't be sittin' there lyin'.
Yes, there is.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.240
- What?
- Brian,

33:38.320 --> 33:41.280
Debrah gonna let Tiffany
go up to Lake Derrick or somethin'

33:41.360 --> 33:43.327
for a Halloween party,
and you need to know that.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.560
What?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.130
That's what she said. That's what I heard.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.960
- Are you kidding me?
- Look, she's 18.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.560
Eighteen is not grown.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.720
Well, I said she can go.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.480
You have to let her grow up at some point.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.482
Are you crazy? People died up there!

34:03.320 --> 34:04.525
Damn it, she's gone.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.480
She's fine. She's an adult.
You have to stop doing this!

34:08.560 --> 34:10.400
- She is not fine.
- I'm telling you...

34:10.480 --> 34:12.600
You know what? I'mma let
y'all handle this. I'mma let you...

34:12.679 --> 34:14.840
Brian, y'all handle that. I'm gonna sit
down. I'mma let y'all handle that.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.286
You're gonna push her away
if you keep treating her like a toddler.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.761
Now the girls are gonna go,
they're gonna have a great time.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.087
And they'll all be together. It's okay.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.120
Wait, my daughter's going too?

34:24.199 --> 34:26.042
Oh. Yes, but it's okay.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.440
She lied to me.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.089
Your daughter's not going,
and neither is mine.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.726
Yes, she is. Goodbye.

34:31.840 --> 34:32.840
Debrah...

34:33.480 --> 34:34.400
Debrah...

34:35.040 --> 34:37.804
Debrah, wait a minute. What...
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.322
Debrah. Hey.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.440
I know you aren't trying to tell me how to

34:42.520 --> 34:44.000
- bring up my daughter!
- She is my daughter, too.

34:44.080 --> 34:44.920
We have got to figure this out.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.520
Well, I said she can go, so she's going.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.520
Where are you going...

34:47.600 --> 34:48.839
I heard them arguing when I was sittin' here.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.239
I know he's sayin' somethin' to her.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.000
She is grown. She is 18.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.047
- What are you saying?
- I am telling you, she's fine.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.320
Oh, yeah. It's gonna end up on <i>Nancy Grace.</i>

34:56.400 --> 34:59.084
I don't care. You need to listen
to what I'm saying!

34:59.200 --> 35:00.160
Wonder why we split up?

35:00.240 --> 35:01.800
I don't know he gonna...
Go see out there, girl.

35:01.880 --> 35:02.840
...you and all your craziness.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.159
Move!

35:09.840 --> 35:11.160
I heard y'all out there fussing, Brian.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.479
What happened? Did you go get her?

35:12.760 --> 35:14.284
- You put your foot down?
- No, he handled it.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.170
That's my seed right there.

35:16.360 --> 35:19.000
He went out there and handled it like a pimp

35:19.080 --> 35:21.127
supposed to handle a ho.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.004
Did you handle it, pimp?

35:24.160 --> 35:25.081
Daddy...

35:25.360 --> 35:26.486
Wait a minute, did you kill her?

35:26.720 --> 35:27.720
You ain't kill her, did you?

35:28.080 --> 35:30.924
I know you put them big-ass foots down
when you went out there, didn't you?

35:31.360 --> 35:34.124
Or somethin' else down.
Did you put it down, player?

35:35.160 --> 35:36.160
No.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.360
- Why not?
- Listen to me, Brian.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.884
That girl cannot go up there.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.600
You know all them folks that died up there?

35:41.680 --> 35:42.520
These kids is crazy.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.964
Debrah lost her damn mind.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.241
No, no, no.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.290
He went out there, but he didn't say nothin'.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.649
- I'm gonna let her go.
- What?

35:51.920 --> 35:55.200
Brian, I'm telling you right now,
do not let that child go up there.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.960
You ain't gonna do nothin'?

35:57.040 --> 35:59.406
Well, she thinks she's grown.
I'mma let her go and see if she's grown.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.720
That's crazy as hell.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.279
But what if something happens
to her up there in them woods?

36:04.920 --> 36:06.920
I'll just pray that nothing happens, okay?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
That's what I'm gonna do, so...

36:08.080 --> 36:11.162
No, pimps don't pray. The hoes is the prey.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.121
Daddy...

36:13.600 --> 36:14.521
Your mama...

36:15.920 --> 36:17.728
Your mama was... I guess...

36:19.600 --> 36:21.363
I get sentimental when I think about her.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.760
'Cause your mama was a hard-working ho.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.843
She was committed to being
on top of the game.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.480
All her teeth out her mouth,

36:28.560 --> 36:30.040
she had her tonsils out and everything.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.042
She wanted to be a professional.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.640
You know what, Daddy? Okay.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.801
You know, your mama was my first,
so she's my bottom.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.560
Daddy, you know what? Okay, listen.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.210
I'm going upstairs.
I'm gonna say good night to all of you.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.810
See your way out, please.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.920
Nobody's moving.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.010
I think he wants us to leave.

36:55.920 --> 36:56.841
Is anybody moving?

36:57.960 --> 36:59.400
I don't damn think so!

36:59.480 --> 37:01.440
Wait a minute.
I know damn well you ain't trying

37:01.520 --> 37:02.884
to put me up out of this house.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.920
We ain't leaving
till we good and ready to go.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.603
You ain't gonna treat me like this, you hear?

37:07.400 --> 37:08.560
You got me?

37:08.640 --> 37:10.562
We done cleaned up this place for you

37:10.840 --> 37:12.409
and this the thanks we get?

37:12.880 --> 37:14.404
You're so darn rude!

37:15.080 --> 37:17.764
I will leave when I get good
and ready to leave.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.120
It takes my car a little while
to warm up anyway.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.521
- You know, your mama was my...
- See your way out, please. Thank you.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.569
You just gonna let her walk all over you?

37:26.560 --> 37:29.080
He been drinking that "buice."

37:29.160 --> 37:30.286
- Joe?
- Yeah.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
What is "buice"?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.444
Bitch juice.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.921
<i># I come alive in the nighttime #</i>

37:45.240 --> 37:47.840

38:10.080 --> 38:12.764
- Wait, 14 murders?
- Fourteen murders.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.600
This makes me so angry!

38:14.680 --> 38:15.965
I don't like being lied to.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.520
This is not like Gabriella.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.480
Well, it's definitely like Tiffany.
She lies all the time.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.404
Why would they wanna go to a party
where people have been murdered?

38:23.680 --> 38:25.010
Even though the killer's been caught,

38:25.400 --> 38:26.480
this still is unsettling.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.448
Yeah, paragraph two. Two brothers.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.200
The brothers were never caught.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.760
So they don't know what's goin' on up there.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.440

38:33.520 --> 38:36.520

40:17.400 --> 40:18.280
We're here, aren't we?

40:18.360 --> 40:20.320
Yeah, barely. We almost died along the way.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.639
But did you die?

40:21.720 --> 40:22.766
No, but a kitten died.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
It was a kitten.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.764
I hear music!

40:26.040 --> 40:28.042
Yeah, let's dance!

40:28.440 --> 40:30.520
We all know how she gets
when she hears music.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.000
Yes, come on!

40:32.080 --> 40:33.240
No, come on. No, listen.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.000
You know how much I hate all this lying.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.640
Okay, who are we lying to though?

40:36.720 --> 40:38.280
Your dad, my crazy dad?

40:38.360 --> 40:39.963
No, no, no. We did not lie.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.520
- We just didn't tell them the whole story.
- Oh...

40:41.600 --> 40:42.760
Please tell me what the difference is.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.200
The difference is,
I just didn't tell them the whole story.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.320
That makes zero sense.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.480
What is she doing here?

40:47.560 --> 40:49.687
I'm sorry. She followed us.
We couldn't just leave her at home.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.960
Tiffany, are you really gonna
ruin my party again?

40:52.040 --> 40:53.564
No, I'm not. She'll be fine.
You'll be fine...

40:53.680 --> 40:55.647
No, she's not fine! Not for him.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.840
Horse!

40:59.920 --> 41:01.320
Who is that girl?

41:01.400 --> 41:02.880
We are not together.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.120
Yes, we are!

41:04.200 --> 41:05.400
No, we're not. You got my number

41:05.480 --> 41:07.560
from some random guy at a bar.
What are you doing?

41:07.640 --> 41:08.879
We're over when I say it's over.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.680
- We never even went on a date!
- Yes, we did.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.240
I've never even talked to you on the phone.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.686
You're my man, and you'll always be my man!

41:15.080 --> 41:17.047
We were never anything.
What are you talking about?

41:17.560 --> 41:18.970
Bae!

41:19.400 --> 41:20.639
That girl is mental.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.848
- Is she stable? What was that?
- She has issues.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.680
- That girl needs help!
- Help!

I'm a Christian.

Well, you know, Jesus,
he turned water into wine, right?

43:35.720 --> 43:36.920
Don't you dare bring Jesus into this.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.160
- What?
- Yes, we goin' to get her.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.840
- What the hell?
- Mabel.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.480
She shouldn't have lied to her daddy.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.240
She might be up there
in trouble or somethin'.

45:16.320 --> 45:18.880
Look here.
Her daddy didn't care if she was goin'.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.520
I don't give a damn if she goin'.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.320
Put this chick in reverse.
Let's go back to the house.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.760
Joe, shut your mouth. We goin'.

45:24.840 --> 45:27.240
Mabel, people got dead up there for real.

45:27.320 --> 45:30.440
This ain't like that last time
when we was playin' around.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.080
That man named Derrick,

45:32.160 --> 45:34.560
Mabel, he killed all them children up there

45:34.640 --> 45:36.520
for trespassing on his land.

45:36.600 --> 45:37.760
We can't go up there.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.689
Please don't forget about Mr. Wilson.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.279
You know Mr. Wilson up there
done killed all them children.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.280
He dangerous.

45:44.360 --> 45:47.204
I sure hope Wilson is there,
so he can take your ass away.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.440
Hattie, shut up.

45:48.520 --> 45:50.999
There ain't no Wilson up there.
They were playin' around with you.

45:51.080 --> 45:52.001
Right.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.281
And why you gotta sit so damn close to me?

45:54.640 --> 45:57.680
Ma, you let me out this dang car
right now, and I mean it.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.160
You sure you wanna get out right now?

45:59.240 --> 46:01.048
- Let me out right now!
- Okay.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.281
Get on out.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.889
I "shanged" my mind.
I don't wanna go out there.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.161
You did what?

46:10.560 --> 46:12.200
I "shanged" my mind.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.320
What the hell is she saying?
She's "shanged" her mind?

46:14.400 --> 46:16.000
Changed her mind.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.360
Say "changed your mind."

46:17.440 --> 46:18.760
And girl, put your teeth in.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.443
You ain't goin' to work tonight.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.120
I ain't goin' out there
with them woods and things.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.960
You know I don't like the woods
and things out there.

46:28.040 --> 46:31.646
You don't like woods,
but I sure love a nice bush.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.808
Then sit there and shut the hell up, Hattie.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.206
- Mabel...
- What?

46:35.560 --> 46:37.368
Why you didn't go up here by yourself?

46:38.080 --> 46:39.604
Yeah, Ma, go on, answer that.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.090
- Go ahead, Ma.
- Shut up.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.288
Y'all was in my car, that's why.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.090
I didn't wanna drop y'all off at home

46:46.440 --> 46:47.840
and then come up here by myself.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.365
So I had all y'all to ride with me.

46:50.840 --> 46:54.520
That is a lie. Mabel, you scared.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.648
- Sure are.
- I ain't scared of nothin', okay?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.400
Mabel, you are scared.
You know you are scared.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.480
If Brian don't wanna
look after his own child,

47:02.560 --> 47:04.209
then we gonna have to look out after her.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.442
Bruh, you better take me home.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.040
And me too.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.120
You know when them children
be having parties,

47:10.200 --> 47:12.679
they have all kind of drugs up here.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.760
That's right.
That's why we need to go up there.

47:14.840 --> 47:17.480
This girl might be out there
strung out on that Ever C.

47:17.560 --> 47:18.840
Hold the hell on. Hold the hell on.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.200
Y'all say somethin' about drugs?

47:20.280 --> 47:23.400
Yeah, they be havin' all kind
of drugs up there, Joe.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.080
Wait, we goin' where the drugs at?

47:25.160 --> 47:26.960
- All kinds of good things.
- Come on, let's ride.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.360
What the hell are you slowin' down for?

47:28.440 --> 47:29.930
Speed up! Let's hurry up and get there, girl.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.641
Yeah, hurry up and get over there
before all the good-good is gone.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.926
I don't know why everyone
thinks this place is so creepy.

47:38.040 --> 47:39.200
I think it's kind of romantic.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.801
Romantic?

47:41.240 --> 47:42.161
Yeah.

47:42.520 --> 47:43.646
You're kind of out there, aren't you?

47:44.360 --> 47:47.200
I can be.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.200
- Hey...
- Back up, frat.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.000
This one here belongs to me.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.400
Hey, relax. She does not belong to anyone.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.410
She's jealous. You see that?

47:56.920 --> 47:59.365
Hey, you don't gotta be jealous.
You got Dino.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.800
That's capital D, capital O!

48:02.880 --> 48:04.449
Oh... No.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.130
Not interested, thanks.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.120
Does she ever stop dancing?

48:08.880 --> 48:10.563
No, clearly not.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.490
Guys, get up. Let's dance.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.046
There's no music.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.560
So what?

48:15.640 --> 48:16.925
Okay, I really think we need to leave.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, why?

48:18.480 --> 48:19.440
You leaving, Panda?

48:19.520 --> 48:20.850
- Yeah.
- All right, then. I'll see you.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.480
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.

48:22.560 --> 48:23.760
Bye.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.880
That is like the 20th couple
I've seen leave tonight.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.240
- We need to get outta here.
- So? We're not scared!

48:29.320 --> 48:31.720
We're gonna ride this out through the night!

48:31.800 --> 48:33.000
I heard that.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.000
No one is riding anything, okay?

48:35.080 --> 48:36.046
We gotta get outta here.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.560
Why is everybody leaving?

48:37.640 --> 48:40.119
This happens all the time. People get scared.

48:40.200 --> 48:42.000
They got curfews and their parents.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.960
And you know what? It's usually the girls.

48:44.040 --> 48:46.645
Yeah, but don't worry. We're here for you.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.480
We work out, like, three times a week.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.324
We can protect you!

48:52.720 --> 48:54.005
Yeah, and if there's no DJ, I'm here.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.644
All right? I got my eye on you.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.004
And I'm gonna get your number
before you leave.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.803
- No.
- You're pretty sexy.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.120
We can make our own music.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.121
I don't care.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.119
All right, well, come sit down, then.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.200
She's annihilated.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.485
How much have you drank, Leah?

49:10.920 --> 49:11.960
Not enough.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.040
Speakin' of that...

49:13.440 --> 49:14.679
- Where's the ice?
- Yeah.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.120
Yeah, where the hell is Kevin?
I sent him for ice, like, a while ago.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.280
All right, Dino, go check.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.320
Hey, Horse, find Kevin.

49:21.400 --> 49:22.924
I sent him for ice, like, a while ago.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.400
What? He just told you to do that.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.401
Yeah, and I told you.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.166
It's like telephone. Like, pick it up.
"Hello, Horse, go get the ice."

49:31.320 --> 49:32.207
Fine.

49:33.560 --> 49:34.686
But only if you come with me.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.281
Giddy-up, Horsey.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.440
Attaboy.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.280
How many girls is he talking to?

49:39.360 --> 49:41.248
I know. He's talking to two
at once right now.

49:41.640 --> 49:42.561
All right.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.127
Looks like there's only one
thing left for us to do.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.240
Oh, yeah? What's that?

49:47.560 --> 49:48.560
Two words.

49:48.960 --> 49:49.881
What?

49:50.280 --> 49:51.201
Bang.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.440
- That's not funny. You're disgusting.
- Listen...

49:56.520 --> 49:58.040
Look, look, you got them two.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.530
You got Jonathan and Tiffany.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.689
Then do the numbers, crunch the math...

50:02.960 --> 50:04.720
- Bingo! You're the lucky winner!
- No, thanks.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.680
- None of this is happening. Move.
- Oh, come on!

50:06.760 --> 50:09.239
- Move over! I'm sitting. Okay?
- Bro.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.640
I'm tryin' here, man. I'm bringin'
my A game. You're hearin' this.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.641
It's true.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.480
So tell me what happened here.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.129
- You mean with the deaths?
- Yeah.

50:17.240 --> 50:19.321
We are not gonna
start talking about this. No.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.561
Let's just say...

50:21.240 --> 50:24.240
A couple of kids came out here
who shouldn't have been out here.

50:24.320 --> 50:25.650
They were trespassing.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.608
- Kind of like we are right now?
- Yes.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.525
Legend has it, they were out here,

50:31.760 --> 50:34.649
and Derrick saw them having sex in the car
and started picking them off,

50:34.760 --> 50:37.205
one by one, and now...

50:37.480 --> 50:38.480
That's the fun part.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.163
Tryin' to make it to the next day.

50:40.720 --> 50:41.641
Dying.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.320
That's not fun.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.000
- How is that supposed to be fun?
- Will you relax?

50:46.080 --> 50:47.410
How am I gonna relax?

50:47.520 --> 50:50.329
Listen, the guys do this
so they can make us scared

50:50.440 --> 50:51.880
and they can feel like they're protecting us.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.040
- I am scared.
- Okay.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.166
Is it workin'?

50:54.600 --> 50:56.760
Touch me, and you'll die
before Derrick gets here.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.489
I'm already dyin' for you, baby.

50:59.520 --> 51:00.441
Know this.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.161
Hey, Kevin!

51:05.760 --> 51:06.999
Where is he?

51:07.720 --> 51:08.641
I don't know.

51:09.520 --> 51:10.850
Well, let's not keep looking for him.

51:11.520 --> 51:12.600
These damn pledgees.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.126
Well, come on, no one's around.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.248
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.090
Especially your crazy ex-girlfriend.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.127
What are you doing? Oh!

51:24.480 --> 51:26.447
- is that blood?
- What is that?

51:26.800 --> 51:28.085
Oh, it's everywhere!

51:28.560 --> 51:30.480
- It's gotta be some kind of joke.
- What do you mean?

51:30.560 --> 51:32.400
Kevin, the pledgee,
he's gotta be playing some kind of joke.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.209
This isn't funny. Let's go.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.561
What is that?

51:38.040 --> 51:38.961
I don't know.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.520
Oh, oh, my God.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.560
Okay, we're gonna leave.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.208
Go! Go! Go!

51:59.960 --> 52:02.480
Hurry up and get over there before
all that good-good is gone.

52:02.560 --> 52:04.163
Joe, shut your mouth. We goin'.

52:06.720 --> 52:07.880
Shit!

52:07.960 --> 52:09.280
I'm gonna knock you in your throat.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.200
Did you see that?

52:10.280 --> 52:12.200
- See what?
- Did you see that?

52:12.280 --> 52:13.240
See what, girl?

52:13.320 --> 52:14.241
- What?
- What?

52:15.440 --> 52:16.566
That little girl.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.880
- I just seen a little girl.
- Look, look, you blowin' my high.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.880
You better shut the hell up, okay?

52:22.960 --> 52:24.927
Girl, don't nobody see no little girl.

52:25.320 --> 52:26.920
What the hell?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.126
Mabel!

52:31.000 --> 52:32.842
Mabel!

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
What is this?

52:34.920 --> 52:36.040
The hell wrong with you?

52:36.120 --> 52:37.320
Oh, my God!

52:37.400 --> 52:38.840
What the hell is you doin'?

52:38.920 --> 52:40.920
- I hit the brakes!
- We know that.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.800
Hell, I almost threw up
all over the damn car.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.880
All my Milwaukee's Best
was almost in Bam's hair.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.200
Mabel, you hit somethin'!

52:48.280 --> 52:51.886
No. I... No, no, I saw horns.
That was a buck. That was a male deer.

52:52.120 --> 52:54.400
Nuh-uh. I saw a white dress.

52:54.480 --> 52:57.005
Well, maybe the deer's transitioning.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.600
What the hell you mean, "transition"?

52:59.680 --> 53:01.249
What the transition of a deer?

53:01.520 --> 53:03.320
How the hell a deer gonna transition?

53:03.400 --> 53:05.800
Mabel, I saw a little girl.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.006
And she had on white?

53:07.120 --> 53:08.840
She did have on a white dress.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.205
That's the same thing I saw.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.330
How the hell you see a girl
that was back there, up here?

53:13.600 --> 53:16.280
That don't make no damn sense.
She defyin' gravity?

53:16.360 --> 53:18.168
I don't know, but I know what I seen.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.000
Mabel, what if you killed her?

53:20.080 --> 53:21.920
Well, that little ho is outta her misery now.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.840
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Mabel, you gotta go check on her.

53:24.920 --> 53:28.760
I ain't finna get out this damn car
and check on nobody.

53:28.840 --> 53:31.720
Mabel, what if the little thing is hurt?

53:31.800 --> 53:34.200
Then she'll die soon like a deer
on the side of the road.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.840
I'm not goin' out there lookin' at her.

53:35.920 --> 53:38.040
Hey, that's what I say.
Put 'em out their misery, babe.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.200
Put 'em out to the pasture.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.004
Madea, stop it now.

53:41.720 --> 53:43.847
Ma, you need to move this here car now!

53:44.720 --> 53:45.641
Joe!

53:46.040 --> 53:49.920
I wish your big ass would ask
me to go out there

53:50.000 --> 53:51.683
and check to see what you hit.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.840
Hell, you'll scare
every damn thing out there,

53:53.920 --> 53:55.205
looking like Sasquatch.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.490
Fine. Fine.

54:00.840 --> 54:01.727
You gonna get out?

54:02.160 --> 54:04.240
What the hell else?
I'mma go check on this... The deer.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.480
I told y'all that was a deer.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.800
Get your big ass out
and go check and see what's goin' on.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.360
Yeah, go ahead, Ma. You check on that.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.646
Yeah, see what the hell I...
I know I hit somethin'.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.000
Well, Mabel, what is it?

54:15.040 --> 54:16.680
What is it, Mabel? What is it?

54:16.760 --> 54:18.045
Bam, hush! Damn!

54:20.360 --> 54:22.760
It's a little blood on the car, that's all.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.082
Must've been a deer.
That's all I hit, was a deer.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.850
Mabel, you didn't hit no animal.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.969
Okay, well, come on. Get back in the car.

54:33.080 --> 54:33.967
Hush!

54:35.560 --> 54:36.606
What is it?

54:37.160 --> 54:38.809
Shh!

54:42.520 --> 54:46.126
I hear somebody cryin'.
Sounds like a little girl.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.041
It's a little...

54:59.000 --> 55:01.640
Oh, Lord, I see her.
I don't know. Y'all come out here.

55:01.720 --> 55:02.760
- Joe?
- What?

55:02.840 --> 55:04.569
Get outta here and go help your sister.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.764
I don't like that dude.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.487
- Come on, Hattie.
- Oh, uh-uh now, Bam...

55:09.840 --> 55:11.640
- Here we come.
- Get out, get out.

55:11.720 --> 55:15.080
Y'all know good and well
I don't like these here woods!

55:15.160 --> 55:17.760
Hey, when all y'all got up
here outta this car,

55:17.840 --> 55:19.330
it raised up nine inches.

55:20.120 --> 55:22.087
Mabel, I don't like this.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.721
These some ignorant-ass fools right here.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.079
I don't like this!

55:26.680 --> 55:28.647
Mabel, look at that blood!

55:29.000 --> 55:31.640
Look, I ain't high enough
to be dealin' with this bull.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.723
You know what? Yeah, y'all... y'all do that.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.879
Come here, Hattie. Hell.

55:41.920 --> 55:42.841
You see?

55:43.640 --> 55:44.640
Hey, little girl.

55:46.600 --> 55:47.885
You all right, little girl?

55:50.480 --> 55:52.243
Mabel, I think she hurt.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.687
Oh, you a Sherlock. I know she hurt.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.760
Maybe, you know what, Mabel? She'll be fine.

55:58.840 --> 56:01.000
If we give her some water,
she'll be just fine.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.760
Bam, water ain't the answer
to every damn thing.

56:02.840 --> 56:04.040
Let's go see about the girl.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.920
Mabel, I don't wanna do this.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.840
- I can't do this.
- Hush! Hush! She might be...

56:07.920 --> 56:09.040
What if she die or somethin'?

56:09.120 --> 56:11.320
- Mabel, you got a record already!
- Hush your mouth.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.526
Come on, let's go.

56:13.160 --> 56:16.280
Hattie, keep pullin' away from me.
Keep pullin' away from me.

56:16.360 --> 56:17.720
- Come on! Come on!
- Here we are.

56:17.800 --> 56:18.680
Keep pullin' away from me.

56:18.760 --> 56:19.760
She is cryin'.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.040
Hey, little girl. You all right?

56:22.120 --> 56:23.280
Don't cry though.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.360
The hell?

56:28.440 --> 56:30.806
Mabel! What the hell is that?

56:33.520 --> 56:36.364
I'm out! I'm out!

56:36.680 --> 56:38.640
Mabel, why you runnin'
down there? Get in the car!

56:38.720 --> 56:39.880
Start the damn car!

56:40.000 --> 56:41.808
Joe, what the hell you doin' up there?

56:42.280 --> 56:43.485
We gotta get outta here!

56:43.720 --> 56:45.520
- This ain't good!
- Drive!

56:45.600 --> 56:47.761
Mabel! Oh, Lord!

56:47.880 --> 56:50.200
- What the hell was it?
- Drive, Joe!

56:50.280 --> 56:51.201
The car won't start.

56:51.760 --> 56:54.120
Oh, hell no!

56:54.200 --> 56:55.040
Where she go to?

56:55.120 --> 56:56.450
- I don't know...
- Where did she go?

57:00.280 --> 57:01.560
Where is she? Where's she at?

57:01.640 --> 57:03.243
Mabel, I really don't know.
I really don't know!

57:04.640 --> 57:05.561
Oh!

57:08.800 --> 57:11.640
I know that damn girl
is not on top of my damn car!

57:11.720 --> 57:13.040
I don't know. Where'd she go?

57:13.120 --> 57:15.000
I don't know, I don't know now!

57:15.080 --> 57:16.720
Oh. Hey. Oh.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.600
Oh!

57:25.240 --> 57:27.440
- Drive! Drive, Joe!
- What is it?

57:27.520 --> 57:28.880
- Hey!
- Look at this!

57:28.960 --> 57:31.160
Ma, there she go! There she go!

57:32.280 --> 57:33.240
Get... Move!

57:33.320 --> 57:35.880
Get it, Ma!
You know how to get this bitch started.

57:35.960 --> 57:38.400
Joe, drive!

57:38.480 --> 57:39.719
Go, Joe!

57:43.240 --> 57:44.960
Why are you so tense? Will you relax?

57:45.040 --> 57:46.120
Where's Leah?

57:46.200 --> 57:48.160
She went with Horse. You should go with Dino.

57:48.240 --> 57:49.520
I'm not going with that creep.

57:49.600 --> 57:50.600
Gabriella...

57:51.080 --> 57:52.920
No, come on. I'm just gonna go look for her.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.480
Don't, don't. Don't, don't, don't.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.400
Why not?

57:55.480 --> 57:58.324
You don't know what they're doin'
out in the woods. Just don't.

57:58.600 --> 57:59.480
You should go with Dino.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.845
I don't wanna go with him!

58:03.640 --> 58:04.680
Look, I just wanna go home.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.440
No. Why? We're having fun.

58:06.520 --> 58:07.600
No, I'm getting sleepy.

58:07.680 --> 58:08.680
- I'm tired. I just...
- Okay, well,

58:08.760 --> 58:11.640
here, have a drink and dance!

58:11.720 --> 58:14.280
No! Are you not aware
of how creepy this place is?

58:14.360 --> 58:16.601
Fine. Go in one of the tents
and zip it all the way up.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.160
People do all kinds of things in those tents.

58:18.240 --> 58:19.440
I'm not going in one of those tents.

58:19.520 --> 58:22.040
Okay. Okay, listen,
we got another tent, all right?

58:22.120 --> 58:23.041
You can stay in there.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.606
Just us girls?

58:24.880 --> 58:26.119
Yeah, just us girls.

58:28.240 --> 58:29.760
- Where is it?
- Come on.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.364
It's over there. I could show you.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.640
What? Okay.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.280
Bye! Good night!

58:36.360 --> 58:37.724
- I'm coming back.
- Why?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.160
So we can go in our tent.

58:39.240 --> 58:42.004
Honey, I'm staying with Jonathan.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.120
- What?
- Yes.

58:44.200 --> 58:46.520
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious!

58:47.360 --> 58:48.520
Bye, don't wait up.

58:48.600 --> 58:49.880

58:49.960 --> 58:51.160
- Fine!
- All right, come on. Let's go.

58:51.240 --> 58:53.481
Don't touch me. I'm not walking with you.

58:57.320 --> 58:59.242
Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.482
Hold on. I need to call my dad.

59:02.240 --> 59:03.640
Wait, what is your dad gonna do right now?

59:03.720 --> 59:04.686
I don't know!

59:05.560 --> 59:07.680
There's no reception!
Where's your phone? Give me your phone!

59:07.760 --> 59:09.840
Leah, phones don't work out here, all right?

59:09.920 --> 59:11.523
- What are we gonna do?
- Let's go! Let's go!

59:32.480 --> 59:34.129
Help!

59:41.160 --> 59:42.490
No! No! No!

59:43.520 --> 59:44.441
No!

59:45.480 --> 59:46.685
I'm gonna get help!

59:53.560 --> 59:55.400
Joe, people like you
work on my nerve when they drive.

59:55.480 --> 59:58.520
Put a little on the gas, let up
on the gas. That's how people get carsick.

59:58.600 --> 59:59.760
Shut up! Let me drive.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.480
You better shut the hell up,
talkin' to me like that.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.840
I will show you how to talk back...

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.600
This car is old. It can't handle that.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.967
Why is you tryin' to drive my car so hard?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.440
Damn, that's what the hell I do
with a car and a woman and a ho.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.805
I drive 'em hard.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.483
Well, now, we ain't goin' nowhere.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.370
Well, look like I'm finna put all you hoes
out on the streets to walk.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.040
I'm not gettin' out this car
and walkin' goin' nowhere.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.880
Do you know what the hell exercise is?

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.360
Exercise and exorcism,
that's what the hell...

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.600
You need to exercise, exorcism...

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.120
And a "circumcism." You need all them things.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.883
Get out and exercise sometime, Mabel.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.920
I ain't gettin' out this car. I know that.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.800
I know that I'm not either.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.960
You know I ain't walkin' nowhere.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.406
'Cause you know you ain't exercisin'.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.320
And you know what?
You gonna be the first one to go.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400
Why you say that?

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.839
You know they gonna catch you.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.320
'Cause everybody else gonna outrun your ass

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.280
and that's all they need,

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.480
is one little piece of meat
hangin' around behind

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.163
and they grab the low-hangin' fruit.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.601
Hush, Joe.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.680
Help me!

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.960
What the hell?

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.279
Girl, I almost punched the hell outta you.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.520
They're trying to kill me!

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.800
This that girl from the party.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.119
Don't open that door.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.641
They're trying to kill me.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.841
Who tryin' to kill you?

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.320
- Derrick!
- Listen, baby...

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.640
Ain't no room in here.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.403
We already are spread out in here.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.089
Please, please, you have to let me in.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.606
I seen that ass. Let her in here.
What's up, mama?

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.440
They already killed one man.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.560
They're gonna kill me too
and they're trying to get Tiffany.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.084
Wait, who they kill?

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.040
Horse!

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.564
- Horse?
- Whores, huh?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.729
That fine, sexy college boy?

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.605
What a waste of a man.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.360
- Please.
- Calm down, baby. Calm down.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.200
Ain't no need in gettin'
all excited. Big Papa here.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.600
No, please help me.
Please, you have to help me.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.240
Nuh-uh! Nuh-uh!

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.760
I want both of them in here.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.967
- Both of what?
- Don't worry about it.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.800
Girl, go ahead and get in the damn car.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.920
- Uh-uhh!
- Thank you.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.330
We don't have enough room for her.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.920
Get in the car.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.924
It's always the ones that's fat
tryin' to keep the sexy ones out.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.000
Okay, we gotta go right now!

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.520
Wait a minute.
Talk to me, honey. Where's Tiffany at?

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.169
She's at the camp still!

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.361
Where is the camp at?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.210
It's all the way up there.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.960
- Well, we gonna have to go get her.
- Yeah.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.928
- No, we don't.
- Uh-uh!

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.519
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's put it to a vote.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.800
Well, look here. Go on and get her.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.600
You know, they always need
a man to come rescue a damsel.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.204
So go on, damn man.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.520
I'm so sick of this.
Wait till this car stops smokin'.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.520
- We will drive back there and get her.
- We'll what?

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.160
What the hell wrong with you?

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.640
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.165
Look, look, look, look, look!

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.885
Oh, no, no, no!

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.166
I ain't gonna see him for a long time.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.080
Yeah, you know what? I ain't worried.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.120
That ain't nothin'
but them damn frat boys from that college.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.122
No, no, no. It's not!

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.808
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.000
Look here, partner.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.200
Go on out there and see if that's them.
Go on out there.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.361
No, that's not them!

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.560
You know what? I'm not playing around.
I'm tired of this.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.320
- No, no, no.
- Mabel...

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.402
To hell with it. I got this.
Y'all sit there and hush.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.366
He is not turned on by you.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.086
I'mma tell you this one time, okay?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.680
I'm not gonna deal
with none of this bull from y'all.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.481
I don't deal with this Halloween bullcrap!

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.841
Okay?

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.519
So let me make this perfectly clear.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.921
I know it's y'all frat boys up in there
playing with this fake...

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.440
What the hell are you doing, Joe?

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.759
I'm getting ready to drive off.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.286
You gonna leave your sister?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.848
I don't like that dude.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.081
Where your eyes?

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.040
Mabel, here he come.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.644
Ma!

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.004
Drive, Joe!

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.970
Joe, I think you better drive.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.200
Mabel, where did he go? Where did he go?

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't know. I don't know now.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.001
Drive, Joe!

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.160
I told you, the tire flat.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.560
Let me tell you somethin'.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.160
You ain't never seen me run from the po-po.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.400
You better drive this son of a... Drive!

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.523
So, uh, this is the tent.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.607
You've been saying
that for the past 20 minutes, okay?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.921
Yep.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.680
Sure you don't want me to stick around?

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.080
- No. I'm good, thank you.
- Check for spiders?

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.167
You can go.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.765
It gets kind of lonely in here.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.006
I can protect myself. Can you just go?

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.440
What if Derrick comes?

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.930
I don't care. I'm fine!

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.285
Okay, so it's cool if Derrick comes in.
I see how it is.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600
You know you're a little uptight?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.760
- I don't care.
- Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.920
You hear that?

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.240
You hear that right there?
How much fun they're having out there?

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.242
- That we're not?
- No, that sounds like little kids.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.321
The hell?

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.929
- What is that?
- I think I'm tripping out.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.520
Yeah. You hear that? Definitely tripping.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.040
Yeah, I hear that. That sounds like little...

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.443
Oh, my gosh. Do you think
those are Derrick's daughters?

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.759
I'm getting out of here, okay?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.040
I'm grabbing Tiffany,
I'm getting out of here.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120
- Hey, quick question.
- What?

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240
How fast can you run?

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.360
- Why?
- That.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.127
Oh, my God! Run! Go!

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.925
Get out of my way!

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.600
So you know what I want for my birthday?

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.249
No.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.161
You.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.720
You should take your clothes off.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.490
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.520
- Dino told me this was gonna happen.
- No, no, no.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.283
- No, no, no, no!
- No? Do I look fat?

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.960
- Look, look, look!
- It was my cheat day!

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.126
Oh, no, no, no!

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.800
Oh, my God!

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.640
No, no, no!

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.240
- What?
- We have to look for Leah and Gabriella.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.559
No, Tiffany, they're on their own!

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.480
We came here with them. We can't leave them.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.480
- Oh, Tiffany, come on. I don't wanna die!
- We have to find them!

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.840
I don't wanna die either,
but they don't wanna die!

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.842
Gabriella! Oh, my God!

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.920
We gotta go.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.200
- We gotta go.
- We have to go.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.920
- There's something going on here.
- I know. We need to leave!

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.600
I saw a road over there. Let's go.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.919
All right, who has a phone?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.280
Um, uh... It's in my boobs. Hold on.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.080
I have reception. I have reception.
I can make a call.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.760
- Who are you gonna call?
- I'm gonna call the police!

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.840
No! We don't wanna get in trouble again!

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.364
I'll call my mom. She'll know what to do.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.440
You're caring about
getting into trouble when we're gonna die?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.283
- Yeah!
- Oh, my gosh.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.403
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello? Mom? Mom?

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.280
<i>- You havin' a good time?</i>
- No!

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.040
- You need to come and get us!
<i>- What's goin' on?</i>

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.360
There's something happening.
There's a guy with a chainsaw.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.440
<i>- What?</i>
- I don't know!

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.920
- There's ghosts.
<i>- Where are you, Tiffany?</i>

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.640
I don't know. I'm in the woods.
Someone's trying to kill us!

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.600
<i>- Where? Where are you?</i>
- I don't know!

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.726
<i>Stay on the line.</i>

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280
Hello? Hello?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.281
The call dropped.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.280
- What do we do? We gotta get outta here.
- I don't know.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.520
- Mabel, doesn't look good.
- Be careful, Joe. Hell.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.800
Here we go again. Tryin' to tell a man...

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.920
Joe, pull over there.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:23.921
You're going too damn fast.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.680
- Pull right here.
- Look here, bruh.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.840
- Pull up, Joe. Hell.
- Shut up, dude.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.520
Get off the damn road
before somebody hit my Cadillac.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.329
- Shut up, sir.
- Pull up right here.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.680
Pull up. You got to let it cool off, Joe.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.204
- Let a man drive.
- Pull up here.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.162
We all know you wanna be a man.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.760
Stop, stop, stop! Damn!

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.440
- Turn the car off.
- Can't run with y'all.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.320
- Turn it off. Hell.
- They have a car out here!

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.520
Is this where they supposed to be?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.360
- They were.
- Need some air freshener up in here.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.885
The hell? This girl got me
out here lookin' all over for her.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.206
Get on out the car, y'all.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520
Ma, you sure?

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.080
Yes, hell.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.240
We gonna get out here?

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.686
Yes, this girl got me out here
lookin' for her.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.600
Come on, Bam!

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.886
There's another sign, Mabel.
Why, we need to...

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.281
Why, we don't need to be out here at all.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.445
I just want you to know.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.689
If they don't come back, I'm here for you.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.679
- Uh...
- Good girl.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.684
Look here, I'm just trying
to be me, you know?

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.440
It's okay.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.761
Yeah, you, you over 18, ain't you?

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.359
No. Mmm-mmm.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:22.407
Oh, hell. Well, never mind.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.240
- No.
- I was just gonna make you feel like a...

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:26.729
- Nope.
- ...a woman.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.439
Where is she at? Come on down here!

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.249
- Ma!
- Come on down here!

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.040
We need to get on up outta here

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.520
before these here people get back, Ma.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.680
Which is another sign

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.363
why we need to get outta here, Mabel.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.845
- Where is everybody at?
- We need to go!

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.964
- Ma?
- What?

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.529
I gotta use the bathroom.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.924
Well, do like Bam here.
Go on, squirt and just piss on yourself.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.807
I do not piss on myself.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:53.560
Okay, well, do like Bam
and squirt a little pee then.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.879
- Squirt a little pee.
- Mabel...

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:56.849
Who you know don't squirt?

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.444
I don't squirt. I shakes.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.319
I'm gonna need y'all to quit this here now.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.287
I said I got to go to the bathroom.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.845
- Well, where the...
- Look it.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.439
That look like an outhouse over there.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.160
Go on over there and use it.
We'll be right here.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.729
- Say what?
- That outhouse.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.564
- That's where the bathroom's at?
- Yes.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.084
Over across the waters over there?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.479
Yeah, girl, go on.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.210
Ma, you, you want...

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.600
What if that little girl over there?

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.479
What?

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.560
What if that little girl over there, Ma?

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.404
I ain't in the mood for this tonight,
I ain't lyin'.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.319
God, we left that little girl way back there.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.447
She ain't round here nowhere.
Go on over there to use the bathroom

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.640
so we can get the hell outta here.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.130
Ma, you'll go with me?

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.560
Why the hell I gotta go? I don't gotta pee!

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.200
Ma, I'm scared to go
over there by myself, Ma.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:39.929
I don't wanna go over there.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.520
Look, I just need to find this girl,
let my car cool off,

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.920
try to put some air in my tire
so I can get the hell up outta here.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.808
Come on. Go with me, Ma, please.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:49.719
Hell, come on, then. Hell, come on.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.399
I know I ain't goin' over there with y'all.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.402
- I'll be right here when ya'll...
- We know, Bam.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.167
I love your little outfit you got on.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.360
You see... What is that? A pussycat?

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.964
I'm a leopard.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.442
You're a leopard?
Oh, okay, if you're a leopard,

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.680
then I will make sure
your stripes get in order.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.320
Shit.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.600
I know you want me.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.680
They say once you go black,
you never go back.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.999
Once you go old,

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.205
you might get mold.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.760
Molded into what I want you to be.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.480
Ugh.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.766
Yeah. You know, they call me a mule.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.240
No! No, no, no!

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.880
No! Ah!

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.080
That's pretty much what happens

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.162
every time I tell a woman that, that I'm...

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.522
They call me "mule."

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.762
'Cause I'm hung.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.320
I know she run.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.926
You better run, 'cause once you go old...

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.161
Little girl,

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.723
I don't know where your mama and daddy at,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.641
but I'm not the man you wanna mess with.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.209
They should have warned you about me.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.160
I'm a pimp from back in the day.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.367
I would slap your ass silly.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.847
Go on somewhere with that bull, little girl.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.642
That's just what the hell I thought.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.799
Come on, Hattie. Hell.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.684
Walk on over here to the bathroom.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.280
Ma, that sure is a long way

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.963
- across the bridge.
- Go on across the bridge! Hell!

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.200
Scared of everything.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.244
Ma, this here water look kind of spooky here.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.840
Ain't nothin' wrong with it.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.159
Just an outhouse over here.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.760
We used to have these back in the country.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.640
Outhouse? Well, I don't know
nothin' about that.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.370
Go, come on! Go ahead. This bridge bouncing.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.160
I don't like the looks of things around here.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.123
This here... What is that?

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.768
Uh-uh, I play about a lot of things,
but my life ain't one of them.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.922
Ma, make sure you stand here with me, hear?

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.243
Fine, there, the outhouse is there.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.361
All right.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.050
You stay here. You wait right here for me.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.480
I'mma wait right here. Go on in there.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.600
- All right.
- I'mma wait right here.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.520
- Go on in.
- All right.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.480
I'm right here, Hattie.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.240
- Don't go nowhere, Ma.
- Go on in the outhouse.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.280
- I'll be right back, Ma.
- Go on in there. Hell.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.320
All right, Ma. I'll be out directly.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.003
- Yes, okay. Go on in.
- All right.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.490
Okay. Ma?

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.684
- Yes?
- You still there?

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.246
If I wasn't out here, Hattie,
would I be saying "yes"?

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.164
All right, I won't be a long time.
Be out in a while here.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.930
In a minute. Just give me a minute.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:20.961
Just hurry the hell up.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.081
All right, Ma.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.730
It's crazy out here.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.001
All right.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.759
You still there, Ma?

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.000
Ma?

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.321
Ma?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.240
Ma, you still there?

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.970
Madea?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.040
Help me, Jesus! Help me!

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.960
You still there, Ma?

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.080
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.360
Help me, Jesus!

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440
- Help me, Jesus!
- Madea?

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.880
Help me, Jesus! I need you, Jesus!

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.760
- I repent all my sins!
- Madea?

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.364
Help me, Jesus!

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:01.961
Ma?

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.081
Madea?

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.926
Madea?

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.280
Madea!

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.645
Ma!

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.405
Ma!

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.965
Ma!

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.804
Madea!

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.650
Madea!

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.605
Yeah, Bam. Hell. That's what I know.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.644
So, you know, if it don't work
out with them, you know...

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.240
Just, I got you covered.
Don't worry about it.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.640
Mabel!

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.767
- Get in the car. Get in the car.
- Joe...

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.240
- What?
- Uh, I need you to go check on Hattie.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.686
Why you ain't help out, bruh?

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.480
We got to get the hell outta here.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.520
What happened?

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.880
I saw him, girl. He out there.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.960
I saw Derrick, baby. He out there. He real.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:51.880
What?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.087
- What the hell happened?
- I saw him.

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.401
Mabel, what?

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.640
I know this gotta be them dumb college kids

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.686
playing a game, I know it.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.439
Madea! Madea!

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.123
- Madea!
- What the hell is wrong with her?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.440
Madea! Ma, open the door!

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.200
- Madea!
- The hell is wrong with you?

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.929
- Madea!
- What?

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.401
Ma!

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.520
You didn't have to leave me like that, Ma.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.000
I sure the hell did.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.400
You should've seen him
comin' out that damn water.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.719
I had to get the hell outta there.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.400
Around here, it's every man for himself.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.685
Ma, Ma.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.848
- I saw her, Ma!
- Saw who?

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.240
- That little girl.
- That little girl's back there.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.640
How the hell you see her over there?

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.480
Joe, that little girl.
I just seen that little girl.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.080
And she tried to get me!

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.923
- You say she was what?
- She was...

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.244
She was watchin' me piss!

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.800
I saw him too.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.040
Nah, Ma.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.048
Uh, uh, uh.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.724
Joe, don't start nothin'.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.042
Uh, oh... Hell no.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.960
I ain't finna look back there, Joe.
Somethin' back there,

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.279
I'mma punch you dead in yo' face.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.850
Look! Look!

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.121
Look!

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.040
- Oh, hell.
- Go, Joe! drive, Joe! Drive!

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.806
Sheriff? Sheriff.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.080
Calm down.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.928
My daughter is at Lake Derrick.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.680
We told those kids not to go up there
and they sneak up there all the time.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.080
Okay, well, she needs help
because she says she's in trouble.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.048
Well, I've got a deputy
up there and I'll look in...

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.923
No, no, no. I need help now, Sheriff.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.250
I'm working on it.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.680
Have a seat.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.762
I'm not gonna sit down. This is my daughter.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.120
Well, there's nothing you can do.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.964
Oh, God, I shouldn't have let her go.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.920
I shouldn't have let her go up there.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.524
No, you should not have let her go.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.200
I know. I'm sorry, Brian.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.519
But can you please help?

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.360
- I don't know what I can do.
- Please.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.440
Do something!

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.170
- How are you this calm?
- Okay, fine. All right.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.120
Sheriff, do you think...

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.566
Okay, come on. I'll take a ride.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.006
I appreciate it. Thank you.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.090
Calvin, it may be, uh...

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.648
A little dangerous up there.
Do you wanna go with us?

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.326
Uh, no, no, it's okay.
You guys got this, right?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.846
I'll stay and, you know, comfort her, okay?

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.130
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.203
Really, she needs me, you know?

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.049
My dad calls it "buice."

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.406
"Buice."

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.210
Thank you, guys. You got this, you know?

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.405
Joe, this car ain't gonna make it.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.720
Mabel...

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.960
I don't know what's goin' on, but
I don't believe it's gonna make it.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.406
That's what I mean about this not a nice car.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.289
We need to take cover, Ma.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.721
Hell no.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.044
What the hell you stoppin' for, Joe?

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.960
This car. That's what she was talking about.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.166
You ain't got no nice car.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.567
Joe, come on, y'all. Let's go!

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.688
Do you know what a woman's car say about her?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.840
It tells you if she any good in the bed.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.800
If a woman got a nice car, that means
a man done put down some money

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.040
and got her a nice car.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.565
You know what this car say about you?

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.081
Don't nobody give a nuts!

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.879
You bitch ass!

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.040
Look here. We gotta take cover, I say.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:16:59.960
What?

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.610
Yes. That's what I did
when I was in the military.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.290
Joe, you was a cook in the army.
What you taking shelter for?

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.240
How the hell you know
what I was doin' in the army?

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.160
Was you there, bruh?

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.680
They only allowed dudes in there.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.205
Was it you who was in the platoon?

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.920
And where the hell
is we supposed to take some shelter?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.763
- Right.
- There.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.760
Ain't no way I'm goin' up there.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.320
Now, first of all,
Bam don't climb no steps. Number one.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.240
And she ain't goin'
up in that raggedy-ass house.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.360
Look at that. Uh-uh.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.804
Haunted house. No.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.560
Bam, somebody tryin'
to kill your ignorant ass,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.607
and you won't walk up five steps?

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.000
- Joe.
- That's somethin', man.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.400
You'll walk up them steps for a honey bun.
I know that.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.561
Your ass'll get up there
for a damn honey bun.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.842
Ain't no dang way I'm goin' up there.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.647
Fine. Sit here and be goat meat
for one of these killers.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.920
You think somebody livin' up in there?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.320
Hattie, that's just ignorance
fallin' out your darn lips right now.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.919
That is ignorance fallin'
from your lips through your brain.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.520
That don't make no sense to me at all.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.681
Look at that house. Do you believe
anybody lives up in that house?

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.121
I know all that, Ma. But doggone!

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.800
Will you just hush?

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.085
Please!

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.240
Y'all think they got a telephone in there?

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.446
Is she serious?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.681
Is she serious?

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.569
Why the hell
would they have a telephone up there?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.560
- They windows is boarded up.
- Right, if they can't afford a window,

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.130
how the hell
are they gonna afford a telephone?

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.203
I don't care if they got a phone in there.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.360
That's shelter. Y'all better go on.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.361
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.160
Joe, why don't you just go
up there and knock on the door?

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.800
Right. Then why don't you go knock?

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.640
Go on up in there and knock?

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.768
You go knock. I think a man
should go up there and knock.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.480
Yeah, you just answered your own question.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.527
Go on up there and knock.
You know you got a scrotum.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.280
Hattie, you gonna have to stop that!

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.680
That's that little bim!

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.200
That's that little bim!
What's that, little bim?

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.720
Ma, look at that little bim!

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.400
That's that little bim!

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.680
- Hattie!
- Get off, get off!

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.680
Get out! Get out of here, Bam!

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760
Here I go!

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.762
Oh, lordy! Oh, these steps!

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.120
- My knees! My breasts! My back!
- We gonna need a bottle.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.480
Mabel, I can't take...

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.721
Yeah, got rid of them asses.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.765
I told my dad and uncle
the awful things you said to me.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.730
And they wanna talk to you.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.080
Hurry up! Get the hell in here!

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.960
- Why the hell are you so slow!
- Mabel!

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.769
Mabel! Slow, nothin'.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.080
Y'all tryin' to kill me, ain't you?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.241
Hell, somebody tryin'
to kill all of us. Damn!

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.481
Where they at?

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.881
Behind me.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.484
Oh, okay, I'll talk to 'em.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.724
'Cause I'm sick of y'all and this bull.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.481
I saw this movie,

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.761
and I'mma show you what
they do to this kind of...

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:45.961
Good luck.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.601
I changed my mind.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.686
Where the hell is Joe?

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.120
I don't know
and I don't give a damn where he at!

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.121
We need a phone!

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.960
Old people, we don't have reception!

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.050
Why are you screaming?

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.560
The hell y'all doin' up in here?

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.879
We've been hiding out here!

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.199
You scared me!

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.480
I'm scared!

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.163
Who the hell else in here with y'all?

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.129
Me and...

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.281
Jonathan.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:19.887
And your boy.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.529
- Your boy's here.
- And me.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.005
Are you pranking us?

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.923
Hell no, ain't nobody pranking you. Hell.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.600
I thought y'all doin' this to us!

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.283
No, it's not us!

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.204
And it sure the hell ain't us.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.641
Oh, hell no!

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.680
- What is it?
- Ma, look!

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.681
What is it?

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.319
What is it? What is it?

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.920
Joe!

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.200
Aah, look!

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.690
- Joe!
- Look!

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.520
They got my baby now! That's my baby!

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.880
Oh, Hattie, that's too much damn drama.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.088
Not my baby! That's Joe! They got him, Ma!

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.607
You not gonna go out there
and help your brother?

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.560
Hell no, I ain't goin'
out there to help him at all.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.561
He on his own now.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.164
He been on his own for a while.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.362
Mama always said he was special.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.040
Damn. Cold-blooded, sister.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.520
Well, he dead now.
We'll look for him in the daylight.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.400
- Praise the Lord.
- Mabel,

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.880
if he dead now, what the hell
we gotta look for him for in the morning?

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.720
You know what? That's right.
When you're dead, it don't matter.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.720
We'll let Jesus find him
when he comes. Praise Him!

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.529
Right! Right.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.440
That's your boyfriend.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.522
You carry your ass out there
and you look for him!

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.161
Well, I'm just gonna pray
and ask God for me another one.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.805
I'm not gonna do this.
I'm not gonna be runnin' from no man!

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.969
Do I look like I'mma be
runnin' from a damn man?

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.040
Let him come his ass over.
Let him come his ass over here.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.760
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What?

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.081
Go out there and I'mma beat his ass!

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.364
Okay, so I get it.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.280
You are big and bad and everything, Ma.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.520
You just got to beat his ass.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.044
That's all you gots to do.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.248
That's right, that's right.
I'm goin' out there.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.645
Soon as I catch my breath.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.160
Them brownies ain't sittin' right.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.560
I shouldn't have eat
them little brown doughnuts.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.442
Well, there he is!

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.920
Where? Where? Who?

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.480
What is he doin'?

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.050
Is that a chainsaw?

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.240
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.162
Is he about to saw up my car?

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.200
He can't hear me, can he?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.690
You better leave my car alone!

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.000
- Look here, Lake Derrick man!
- Mabel...

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.000
- What is it?
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.160
Bam, don't start that wiggle.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.200
Mabel, I gotta...

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.720
I gotta teet...

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.840
I gotta tinkle. I gotta tee-tee.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.489
- Bam.
- Mabel, I gotta pee.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.805
- Come on.
- Bam.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.325
Tinkling is for little people.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.888
Pissin' is for big-ass people like us.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.160
Well, Mabel.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.445
Lord have mercy.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.760
You better damn hold it!

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.127
Well, now, Ma, you know good
and well she ain't able to do that.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.324
Just hush.
I gotta figure out what we gonna do.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.488
- Guys, we can make a run for my car.
- Yes!

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.405
Girl, how the hell all of us
gonna fit in a damn Mini Cooper?

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.961
Well, I was hoping that you'd stay here
and we'd go for help.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.690
- Yes.
- You know what?

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.680
That's what we gonna do. We that damn stupid.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.330
We gonna stay here and let you go
get in the car and leave.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.481
Y'all need some help.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.680
I'll go for help.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.880
God almighty!

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.399
Hattie, stop swinging
that damn purse before you hit me!

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.085
- Dad?
- Hey!

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.160
- Dad.
- Gabriella.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.680
- I'm so happy to see you.
- What's goin' on?

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.480
- There's people coming. We have to go.
- What?

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.209
We gotta go! To the other side. Other side!

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.280
- Run, run, run.
- What is goin' on? What...

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360
There's people in the house.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.440
They're killing us! And then the little girl!

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.360
Look!

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.329
Yes!

01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.960
Hey, hey!

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.720
You mean this little girl?

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.360
- Yes! Yes, that's her!
- Yes! Obviously, that one!

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.726
- I'm just gonna talk to her.
- No!

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.800
Everybody, calm down. I'm just gonna talk...

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.730
- Come on, bro!
- He talkin' to her!

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.760
Look at him! He's crazy as hell!

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.761
Look at that girl.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.207
He's the ghost whisperer.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.200
Cool. Cool.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.760
He bringin' her over here!

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.968
No, no, no!

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.840
Hold the hell on, Brian.
Why this little girl not attacking you?

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.360
Why you got all that damn mud on your shoe?

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.804
What you and Victor been doin'?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.361
Well...

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.961
- Dad, did you do this?
- Uh...

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.366
Well...

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.881
It's a good one.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.600
Look. We got you!

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.165
So you think this is funny, right?

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.003
No. I did not think it was funny.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.800
No, you wanna sneak up here
and come up to Lake Derrick

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.927
without talking to me. This is not good.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.481
This place is dangerous, as you can see.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.280
Really dangerous.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.565
This was not funny.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.280
I thought it was funny. Didn't you, Victor?

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.281
I really did.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.680
Seeing that you lied to me.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.010
I'm sure you're sorry now though.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.162
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't mean to lie to you.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.447
Wait, so where are all the other people
that were here?

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.800
Um, uh... Don't worry
about that. And you, son.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.760
You wanna date my daughter?
Let me explain something to you.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.640
You have to come and knock on my door
and say you wanna take her out.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.040
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.520
You don't just sneak up here with her.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.280
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.080
You remember Rose and Renee
who brought the ponies?

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.287
This is Rose and Renee.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.800
Come on, let's go. Come on!

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.800
All right, everybody. Come on.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.480
You wanna know where they are?
Get in the car.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.924
- Okay.
- All right. Shotgun.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.045
Get in the car. Come on, let's go.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.809
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Scoot all the way over.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.440
- Sheriff...
- Listen,

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.360
I told you I have a deputy up there.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.885
But something needs to happen.
I've been waiting for hours.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.490
You give me no information.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.005
- Come on!
- Mom!

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.322
Oh! Oh, baby!

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.088
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.280
Oh, my God! You scared me to death.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.680
I was scared to death. But it was Dad.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.520
What do you mean, it was Dad?

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.042
Dad and Mr. Vic tried to prank us.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.600
- Hey, don't...
- Now you know better.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.807
Do not start with me.
You shouldn't have let her go up here.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:18.921
I know, I know.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.001
You what?

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.206
You're right.

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.930
I know. I'm sorry.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.480
She said I was right.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.121
Yes, I am right. You're right. I am right.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.119
I'm right!

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.530
And we have to co-parent.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.608
And we have to co...

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.560
- That's right.
- That's right.

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.882
She's 18, but we've got one more to go,
and we should co... we should co-parent.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.199
But I'm sorry.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.120
I'm gonna do better, okay?

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.160
I'm gonna do better.

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.320
- Come here.
- Okay.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.400
That's all right.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.561
Hey, man.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.966
You came to bail us out, right?

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.720
What? Everybody's locked up?

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.449
Yeah, trespassing.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.643
Boo! Happy Halloween!

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.724
You were in on this, Anna?

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.201
Sure was.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.329
Thought it would teach him
not to cheat on me!

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.963
I know you want it. I know you want it.
You still want it!

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.519
You can't hide from me!

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.120
Dad, are you serious?

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.080
What? They all had drugs on them.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.684
We thought they were all dead.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.723
Well, you happy they're alive?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.081
Although, that one,

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.645
he'll be staying here a little longer.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.001
Wait, me?

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.760
Why... Why me?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.524
You were hittin' on my daughter!

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.159
But wait till you get out here.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.679
'Cause I'm gonna braid your hair

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.040
and then I'm gonna mousse it.

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.960
I'll bail you out, baby.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.880
Yeah, don't take that deal, dude.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.680
Uh, you're just, uh...
You're better off in jail.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.080
Just spend the night there.
I think you're safer.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.849
You sure about that?

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.760
I'll stay in here. No, it's okay.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.806
Hattie!

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.483
Leave that baby alone
before you give him worms.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.484
Girl, I ain't got nothin'
but some gummy worms for him.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.320
- Mabel...
- Shh!

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.481
Don't call my damn name.
The government up in here.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.045
Oh, Madea.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.247
That's what the hell they know me by. What?

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.520
What is you duckin' down for?

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.761
Hush, I'm trying to be inco-gragrigo.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.400
Inco-gragrigo?

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.840
Shut... Girl, yes.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.680
We ain't goin' to no
inco-gragrigo this weekend.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.840
Bam, hush.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.769
I have to be on the low.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.800
On what kind of low?

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.802
I have to be on the low
'cause I'm on the wall.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.525
Look. Look on the wall.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.440
- Mabel!
- Bam!

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.320
Shut the... Hi, Officer.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.367
Shut up. Don't be temptin' my damn anger.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.360
As soon as I can run the hell up outta here,

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.442
I'm gettin' the hell up out this bitch.
I'm telling you right now.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.169
That is a beautiful picture.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.160
You look so pretty.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.880
Do I? That was my good side.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.880
That's one of them old ones
from back in the day, honey.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.199
That's one of my early mug shots

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.610
when I was in the Black Panthers.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.280
Is that right?

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.760
Yeah, they used to call me Pussy Panther.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.120
But Mabel, they got you down for check fraud.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.960
That ain't all. You didn't read all of them.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.960
"Check fraud, criminal trespassing..."

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.800
Yeah, attempted murder.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.840
Assassination.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.800
- Deadly weapon.
- Deadly weapon.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.768
Wait! This is a joke, right?

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.087
No, no. Our work here is done.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.163
You gotta bail us out. Please! Please!

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.242
You guys figure it out,

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.164
and get everybody outta jail.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.760
All on you.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.759
- We're done.
- We got 'em.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.800
- We got 'em.
- That's it!

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.520
- Nice when a plan comes together.
- Yeah, man.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.170
And that thing with the water
that you did was really, really great.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.406
- The water?
- Yeah.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.201
That wasn't me.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.647
Come on.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.080
That was you.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.399
No, that...

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.481
Hey, partner.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.560
They tell me you killed your whole family.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.561
That right?

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.520
Well, look, I got this sister of mine

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.440
that I've been wantin' dead for a long time.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.680
She's a big old dude.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.085
You think you can help me with that?

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.050
I'll share some of that good-good with you.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.129
40-Baker, take one. Mark.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.000
Hold on. Come on, Brian. Wait a minute.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.763
Wait, wait for "action." Damn.

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.165
40-Baker, take one.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.368
He ready to go. And action.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.210
Them drugs done mess you up.
Y'all know he 32?

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.487
Thirty-two years old, sittin' there,
lookin' like he 99.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.490
Mabel, anybody ever tell you
you just look like a man?

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.680
I mean, you just look like a man in a dress.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.360
Ain't nothin' soft, ain't nothin'
feminine, ain't nothin' pretty.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.770
You just look like a dude.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.246
What is wrong with you?

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.120
Ma! Ma!

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.647
Madea!

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.680
Okay. One more time.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.960
One more time.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.848
- Deadly weapon.
- Deadly weapon.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.241
On the White House grounds. Treason.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.283
Let's try it again.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.083
What the hell is a car beepin' for?

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.560
'Cause it's a...

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.840
Oh, Lord. She don't know nothin'.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.320
When your ass gets up in the morning,

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.360
you back up out the bed...
I hear, "Beep, beep, beep."

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.170
It let people know
that a wide load is comin' through.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.805
Oh, damn.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.720
Wait till you get out here!

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.280
Great. One more time.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.080
"I'm gonna braid your hair
and I'm gonna mousse it!"

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.440
One more time, okay? Here we go.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.480
All right, here we go.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.280
- Ready?
- Only for you.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.963
- Man, that's crazy.
- All right, cool.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.281
Here we go.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.041
Action.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.080
What the hell, girl?

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360
Are you all right?

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.919
Mabel!

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.680
And we cut. Check the gate.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.729
So go this way. This way a little bit.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:53.881
Do you have her?

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.680
Get your ass outta here.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.960
And your corn wasn't even bread.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.960
Did you say, "And your corn..."

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.806
"And your corn wasn't even bread?"

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.439
Madea!

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.328
Madea!

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.640
What?

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.559
You know what?

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.840
- Action.
- You ju...

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.520
Mabel. You know what?

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.603
Yes, I know what. This is the real...

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:21.880
Yes, I know what.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.160
Bae! One minute!

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.366
Anna! Anna! Anna!

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.284
Cut. All right, let's...

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.804
I'm sorry!

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.520
- You did that?
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.760
That's a great voice, there.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.920
I'm gettin' ready to go out there.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.410
- You know what I'mma do?
- What?

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.601
Beat his ass.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.120
Okay, Mabel. Well, come on,
let's go. Let's go.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.803
The door this way. Why you pointin' that way?

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.120
'Cause something's gonna happen over here
and you need to cross.

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.361
You do it too much. You know what I'mma do?

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.520
Drive. Drive. Drive.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.080
The door's locked. Door's locked.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.604
Oh, my God!

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.280
It's four o'clock in the damn morning.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.480
We gonna lose...

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.880
We over here with my cousins.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.166
They like, "Go on, TP,
do what you need to do."

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.841
When y'all hear the gunshots, just get low.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:20.680
It's way down there...

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:24.161
behind her belly button.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.120
It's just in there.
It's desecrated in there. That's all.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.480
That breath done marched
up outta your mouth like the Confederates.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.120
Don't do that no damn more.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.080
Walking dead comin' up outta your lips.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.366
Don't spray it now.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.249
Wait, get a little wider there. Back there.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.362
You dial 1-800-CHOKE-THAT-HO,

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.159
and we sent out pimps
from all across the nation

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.920
to come handle your situation.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.320
No, it was good.

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.560
That's a wrap on <i>Boo 2,</i> guys.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.080
All right, guys. Thank you so much.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.722
Thank you, crew. Great job, everybody.

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.369
<i># What are those footsteps behind you? #</i>

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.123
<i># What creature lives under your bed? #</i>

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.440
<i># A ghoul or a creep #</i>

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.520
<i># And he comes when you sleep #</i>

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:25.489
<i># A chill when you wake up the dead #</i>

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.170
<i># What is that howl from the woods #</i>
