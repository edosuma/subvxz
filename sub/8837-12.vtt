01:36.763 --> 01:38.222
[HAWK SCREECHES]

01:44.813 --> 01:46.230
[SOFTLY]
A SOARING HAWK.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.358
WHAT?

01:49.526 --> 01:51.568
JUST STUDYING
THAT HAWK UP YONDER.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.405
OH, YEAH.
CHICKEN HAWK.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.077
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
IS GOING ON
IN HIS HEAD?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.537
WHAT?

02:03.081 --> 02:05.207
WHAT'S HE THINKING?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.543
HE'S GOT A BRAIN
LIKE WE HAVE.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.295
GOT A HEART.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.797
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
GOING ON IN HIS HEAD

02:11.965 --> 02:14.466
WHILE HE'S LOOKING
DOWN AT US
PITCHING HAY?

02:19.013 --> 02:21.807
SOMETIMES I WONDER
ABOUT YOU, BOY.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.642
ME, TOO.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.936
SUSPECT THAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.857
YOU'RE RIDING THE WIND,
AND ME, I'M JUST...
RIDING A HAY WAGON.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.567
FARMING DON'T GIVE A MAN
MUCH OF A CHANCE

02:31.734 --> 02:33.861
FOR RIDING THE WIND.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.488
BUT THEN IT AIN'T
A BAD LIFE, FARMING.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.407
AT LEAST YOU'RE
YOUR OWN MAN.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.243
I KNOW.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.744
GET ON!

02:51.129 --> 02:52.588
Mary: JOHN!

02:52.755 --> 02:55.382
-JOHN!
-WHOA.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.760
JOHN!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.181
PA, I'LL BE
HOME DIRECTLY.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.025
JUST COME IN
ON THE STAGE!

03:13.193 --> 03:15.402
-I'D ABOUT GIVEN UP.
-YEAH, ME, TOO.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.737
WHAT'S IT SAY?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.322
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.452
"JOHN SANDERSON,
ESQUIRE,

03:23.620 --> 03:25.078
"WE APOLOGIZE
FOR THE DELAY
IN ACKNOWLEDGING

03:25.246 --> 03:26.663
"RECEIPT OF

"PLEASE KNOW IT WAS
NOT LACK OF INTEREST

03:30.627 --> 03:34.504
THAT OCCASIONED
THE DELAY.
ON THE CONTRARY."

03:34.672 --> 03:35.881
THEY LIKE THEM.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.467
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
GO ON, JOHN.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.927
"WE HAVE DISCUSSED
YOUR WORK IN DETAIL

"WHICH WE FEEL SHOULD

"TO THAT END, OUR
MR. FREDERICK DEERING

WILL COME TO CALL

03:53.191 --> 03:55.901
THEY'RE GOING
TO BUY MY POEMS.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.778
THEY'RE GOING
TO BUY MY POEMS!

03:57.946 --> 04:00.405
THEY'RE GOING TO
PUBLISH MY POEMS
IN "THE PATHFINDER"!

04:00.573 --> 04:06.203
OH, I'M GOING TO GET PAID
FOR DOING WHAT I LOVE
BEST IN ALL THE WORLD.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.038
SECOND BEST.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.873
I'M SO HAPPY
FOR YOU.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.125
NOT FOR ME.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.794
FOR US.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.307
YOU CAN LIVE
ANYWHERE YOU PLEASE
IF YOU'RE A WRITER,

04:27.475 --> 04:29.101
IN TIMBUKTU
IF YOU WANT.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.352
I WANT TO
STAY HERE.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.604
SO DO I. IN
OUR OWN HOUSE.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.982
YEAH. I KNOW JUST
THE PLACE FOR IT.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.316
ON THE RISE, JUST
ABOVE OUR PLACE.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.734
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

04:37.902 --> 04:41.780
I COULD TELL
THE FIRST TIME WE
WENT THERE TOGETHER.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.907
WITH PA'S HELP,
I COULD BUILD IT...

04:44.075 --> 04:46.034
WITH A CORRAL
AND A BARN.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.244
AND A HORSE!

04:47.412 --> 04:48.912
MAYBE TWO.
MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE A PAIR!

04:49.080 --> 04:50.163
AND A COW?

04:50.331 --> 04:51.790
-HOW GOOD ARE YOU
AT MILKING?
-VERY GOOD.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.834
AND I CAN CHURN
THE BEST BUTTER
YOU EVER TASTED.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.377
THAT'LL BE A HELP.

04:55.545 --> 04:59.047
WE'LL NEED
A VEGETABLE GARDEN
JUST LIKE MA'S.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.924
STRANGE WHAT MONEY
DOES TO YOU.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.010
IT MAKES YOU
FEEL GROWN UP
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.344
IT ISN'T
EVERYTHING, PA SAYS,

05:04.512 --> 05:06.596
BUT IT SURE HELPS.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.559
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN
CARRYING ON AS IF
IT WAS ALL SETTLED.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.147
I NEVER EVEN
ASKED YOU.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.523
YES, YOU DID.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.983
THAT WAS YESTERDAY,

05:18.151 --> 05:19.693
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.614
I THINK I'D BETTER
ASK YOU AGAIN.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.116
GO AHEAD.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.619
MARY INGALLS...

05:29.787 --> 05:31.455
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH...

05:33.458 --> 05:35.667
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.755
I WANT YOU
TO BE MY WIFE.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.884
THANK YOU, JOHN.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.395
Grace:
FOR WHAT WE ARE
ABOUT TO RECEIVE,

05:55.563 --> 05:58.357
MAY WE BE TRULY
THANKFUL. AMEN.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.192
-AMEN.
-AMEN.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.694
THE BUSINESS WITH
THE POETRY. HOW'D
THAT GET STARTED?

06:02.862 --> 06:03.945
MISS BEADLE.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.031
SHE SAID THAT JOHN'S
POEMS ARE TOO GOOD

06:06.199 --> 06:08.408
TO KEEP HIDDEN AWAY
IN A NOTEBOOK.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.577
YOU KEPT IT
UNDER YOUR HAT,
SEEMS LIKE.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.621
WELL, WE THOUGHT
MAYBE NOTHING
WOULD COME OF IT.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.165
WELL, MAYBE
NOTHING WILL.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.833
HOW DO YOU FIGURE
WHAT A POEM'S WORTH?

06:17.001 --> 06:17.959
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THEY FIGURE IT UP

06:18.127 --> 06:19.669
THE SAME WAY
AS THEY DO CORN.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.755
EXCEPT IT DON'T
GO BY THE BUSHEL.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, JOHN?

06:21.923 --> 06:25.008
YEP. YOU SET IT UP
ON THE SCALE,
WEIGH IT OUT.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.719
16 POEMS, 428 LINES,

06:27.887 --> 06:29.596
3 1/4 POUNDS...

06:29.764 --> 06:32.140
COMES TO $7.10 EXACTLY.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.934
YOU'RE PULLING
MY LEG.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.019
Isaiah: WELL, NO MATTER
HOW YOU FIGURE IT UP,
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE

06:36.187 --> 06:38.438
A FEW DOLLARS COMING IN
ON THE SIDE.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.524
WON'T BE ON THE SIDE.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.109
HMM?

06:42.276 --> 06:44.694
I'M GOING TO MAKE
A LIVING AT IT, PA.

06:44.862 --> 06:45.862
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
FULL-TIME?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.239
YOU MEAN YOU AIN'T
GOING TO WORK?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.698
OF COURSE I'LL WORK.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.410
THIS'LL BE MY WORK,
WRITING POEMS AND STORIES.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.453
WELL, DON'T LOOK
SO SURPRISED, ISAIAH.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.039
THERE'S NOTHING SO
UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.874
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
UP IN THE MORNING,

06:58.042 --> 07:00.210
DRINK YOUR COFFEE,
GO OFF TO WORK
WITH A PENCIL?

07:00.378 --> 07:03.713
YEP. THEN WRITE DOWN
THE WORDS AND SEND THEM
OFF TO THE PUBLISHER.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.382
AND GET MONEY
FOR IT REGULAR?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.509
THAT'S WHAT
YOU HOPE FOR.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.595
JOHN, SLOW DOWN.
YOU'RE EATING TOO FAST.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.472
I GOT TO HURRY, MA.
I GOT SOME WORK.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.057
WHAT WORK?

07:14.225 --> 07:15.767
WELL, GET MY
POEMS READY,

07:15.935 --> 07:17.602
MAYBE SHARPEN UP
A FEW THINGS.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.438
GET READY FOR
THE MAN FROM
"THE PATHFINDER."

07:19.605 --> 07:21.773
NOW WAIT, HOLD ON
HERE. WE GOT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.693
YOU CAN'T MAKE
A LIVING PUTTING
WORDS DOWN ON PAPER!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.653
WELL, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.530
GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER
MOUTH TO FEED
PRETTY SOON.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.456
I JUST ASKED MARY
INGALLS TO MARRY ME.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.040
AND SHE SAID SHE WOULD.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.224
HAVE YOU HEARD
ANY TALK ABOUT
THE RASMUSSENS?

07:56.392 --> 07:57.601
LIKE WHAT?

07:57.768 --> 07:59.311
THAT THEY WERE
SELLING THEIR PLACE
AND MOVING EAST.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.605
HANSON SAID HE
HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.315
A MAN'S GOING
TO COME AND
TALK TO JOHN

08:03.483 --> 08:04.357
ABOUT PAYING HIM
FOR HIS POEMS.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.984
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
I KNOW.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.820
GOING TO BE NICE
HAVING A WORKING POET
AROUND WALNUT GROVE.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.447
I WAS JUST THINKING,
IF THEY DO SELL OUT,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.949
I'D LIKE TO PUT
A BID ON THAT BAY
MARE OF THEIRS.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.118
MR. FREDERICK
DEERING,
HIS NAME IS.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.119
WHOSE NAME?

08:16.287 --> 08:17.662
THE MAN FROM
"THE PATHFINDER."

08:17.830 --> 08:21.041
OH. YOU KNOW,
THAT MARE'S GOT TO
BE 16 HANDS HIGH.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.792
CAN'T BE MORE
THAN 6 YEARS OLD.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.504
GOING TO HAVE TO PUT
THAT BLACK HORSE OUT
TO PASTURE PRETTY SOON.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.631
"YOUR OBEDIENT
SERVANT, JEREMY HOLLIS,

08:27.798 --> 08:29.341
EDITOR OF
THE PATHFINDER."

08:29.509 --> 08:31.301
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE
OUR MONEY AND PUT IT
IN THE BANK.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.928
VERY GOOD.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.847
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
THEY'D ASK FOR
THE ANIMAL, BUT--

08:38.643 --> 08:40.977
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.146
I SAID WE'RE GOING
TO SAVE OUR MONEY.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.481
WELL, WHO'S WE?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.149
JOHN AND I.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.442
FOR WHAT?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.986
A HOUSE. A PLACE
OF OUR OWN.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.909
WELL...

08:56.077 --> 08:57.410
WHY NOT?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.164
WELL, I--I DON'T
KNOW WHY NOT.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.332
I JUST NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.960
I MEAN, SHE'S ONLY
13 YEARS OLD.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.003
CHARLES, HOW OLD
WERE WE WHEN WE MET?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.672
OH, COME ON, CAROLINE.
YOU KNOW THAT'S DIFFERENT.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.340
WE WEREN'T EVEN SERIOUS.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.925
[LAUGHS] WE WEREN'T?

09:22.061 --> 09:24.187
Isaiah: YOU KNOW, INGALLS,
I DON'T KNOW AS I'D PICK
YOU TO BE A RELATION.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.314
MAYBE I'M GOING TO
GET YOU WHETHER I
WANT YOU OR NOT.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.067
TIME'S ON OUR SIDE.
WE AREN'T GOING TO LET
HER MARRY TILL SHE'S 15.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.652
THAT'S A YEAR
AND A HALF AWAY.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.112
HE'LL BE OVER
TO TALK TO YOU
BEFORE LONG.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.989
I'LL BE READY FOR HIM.

09:34.156 --> 09:37.075
YOU KNOW, I AIN'T EXACTLY
THE WORLD'S GREATEST
AUTHORITY ON POETRY.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.494
SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THEM
WAS PRETTY WELL OFF
WHEN THEY STARTED.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.290
BYRON WAS A LORD.
WHAT DO YOU FIGURE
A LORD MAKES?

09:43.457 --> 09:44.541
MORE THAN A FARMER.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.042
CAN'T GET IT
THROUGH MY HEAD

09:46.210 --> 09:47.544
HOW A BOY CAN GO OFF
INTO THE WORLD

09:47.712 --> 09:50.088
AND MAKE A LIVING
PUTTING WORDS
DOWN ON PAPER.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.715
HE'S JUST A PUP.
HE DON'T KNOW

09:51.882 --> 09:52.757
HALF THE THINGS
WE KNEW AT HIS AGE.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.134
AH, HE'LL LEARN.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.468
MAYBE. CAN'T SAY
NOTHING TO HIM, THOUGH.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.053
BOY'S GOT TO MAKE
HIS OWN DECISION.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.014
HE ASK YOU FOR ADVICE,
YOU GIVE IT TO HIM.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.266
HE DON'T, YOU SHUT UP.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.436
WELL, LIKE YOU SAY,
WE GOT A YEAR AND A HALF.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.231
HE'S COMING!

10:08.399 --> 10:11.026
HE'S ON
HIS WAY!

10:11.193 --> 10:12.527
-HE'S HERE!
-WHO?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.362
THE MAN FROM
"THE PATHFINDER."

10:14.530 --> 10:16.531
-HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS HIM?
-I COULD TELL.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.907
HE WAS DRIVING
A LIVERY RIG.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.326
HE HAD A STORE-
BOUGHT SUIT ON,

10:19.493 --> 10:20.994
A SATCHEL,
AND A NECKTIE!

10:21.162 --> 10:23.413
HE'S PROBABLY
IN THE HOUSE
RIGHT NOW!

10:23.581 --> 10:24.914
WHOO-HOO!

10:27.001 --> 10:29.294
-WATCH THE TEAM.
-OKAY.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.923
WE'RE ALL VERY
IMPRESSED WITH YOUR
WORK, YOUNG MAN.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.675
THANK YOU, SIR.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.053
IMAGINATION IS
A GIFT, YOU KNOW.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.097
CAN'T BE TAUGHT.
CAN'T BE LEARNED.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.434
YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE IT.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.686
I HOPE YOU'RE
PROPERLY GRATEFUL.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.271
YES, SIR,
I AM.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.190
JOHN READS
A GREAT DEAL.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.025
OF COURSE.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.235
WELL, TELL ME,
JOHN...

10:54.403 --> 10:56.946
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO
WITH YOUR LIFE?

10:57.114 --> 11:00.116
WELL, SIR,
I'D LIKE TO
BE A WRITER.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.702
WELL, YOU'VE MADE
A VERY GOOD START.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.915
DO YOU WORK
HARD AT IT?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.709
I DON'T HAVE TO, SIR.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.837
I DON'T KNOW JUST
HOW IT HAPPENS.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.049
MY MIND IS JUST
FULL OF PEOPLE.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.759
I CAN LIE ON MY BACK

11:17.927 --> 11:20.762
AND LET MY MIND GO,

11:20.930 --> 11:22.931
AND THINGS HAPPEN.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.808
WORDS...

11:24.975 --> 11:28.978
AND LINES OF POETRY
AND STORIES...

11:29.146 --> 11:31.523
KIND OF LIKE MUSIC
INSIDE ME.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.818
THAT'S WHY I CALL MY
POEMS "PRAIRIE SONGS."

11:34.985 --> 11:37.570
THE WORDS JUST COME
FLYING IN MY HEAD.

11:37.738 --> 11:41.533
WELL, YOU JUST MIGHT
BE A WRITER IN TIME.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.244
YOU HAVE THE TALENT
AND THE IMAGINATION.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.998
WHAT YOU NEED NOW
IS THE DISCIPLINE
TO SHAPE IT.

11:49.166 --> 11:53.753
IT'S A FINE
BEGINNING. FINE.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.588
BUT NOT YET READY
FOR PUBLISHING.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.759
THEN...I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.554
EACH SPRING,
WE CHOOSE
A PROMISING BOY

12:02.722 --> 12:06.808
FROM THE FARMING
COMMUNITY TO SEND
TO THE UNIVERSITY--

12:06.976 --> 12:09.060
SEED CORN,
A SPRING SOWING

12:09.228 --> 12:11.604
IN THE HOPES THAT
IN A DOZEN YEARS

12:11.772 --> 12:15.650
WE MIGHT HAVE
ANOTHER SAM CLEMENS,
CULLEN BRYANT.

12:15.818 --> 12:20.488
WE FEEL THAT YOU
ARE AN EXCELLENT
PROSPECT, YOUNG MAN.

12:20.656 --> 12:24.617
WE'RE OFFERING
YOU 4 YEARS AT
THE UNIVERSITY.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.120
BOARD, ROOM, TUITION.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.877
OH, JOHN!

12:34.044 --> 12:36.212
WELL, THIS IS
THE PROPOSAL.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.672
I KNOW IT'S
A BIG DECISION.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.215
YOU'LL WANT TO
DISCUSS IT WITH
YOUR PARENTS.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.301
-YES, SIR.
-NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

12:41.469 --> 12:42.385
I HAVE A TRAIN
TO CATCH.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.720
OH, YES,
OF COURSE!

12:43.888 --> 12:45.972
NOW, JOHN, SHOULD
YOU DECIDE NOT
TO ACCEPT,

12:46.140 --> 12:47.724
WE HAVE ANOTHER
YOUNG MAN IN MIND,

12:47.892 --> 12:50.518
AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE
YOU LETTING US KNOW
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.145
YES, SIR.
I WILL.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.481
-A REAL PLEASURE,
MA'AM.
-WELL, THANK YOU, SIR.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.066
I HOPE YOU'LL
ACCEPT, JOHN.
BYE.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.903
-BYE.
-GOOD-BYE!

13:00.070 --> 13:01.237
OH, THINK OF IT, JOHN!

13:01.405 --> 13:03.573
A 4-YEAR SCHOLARSHIP!

13:03.741 --> 13:05.408
ISAIAH, ISN'T IT--

13:05.576 --> 13:06.910
PA?

13:14.752 --> 13:16.085
PA!

13:16.253 --> 13:17.754
I'M GOING
TO RUN OVER
AND TELL MARY.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.714
THEN I'LL BE
BACK TO GIVE
YOU A HAND.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.424
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.802
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU NEED ME ON TOP
OF THE LOAD.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.345
LOADED A LOT OF
HAY WAGONS BY MYSELF.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.888
RECKON I CAN
DO IT AGAIN,

13:27.056 --> 13:28.807
WHAT WITH YOU GOING
OFF TO COLLEGE.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.892
I'M NOT GOING AWAY
UNTIL FALL.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.769
AS LONG AS I'M HERE,
I'M GOING TO HELP.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.772
GOING TO BE A POET,
YOU GOT NO BUSINESS
PITCHING HAY.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.273
YOU DON'T WANT
ME TO GO.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.484
IT'S YOUR LIFE.
IT'S YOUR DECISION
TO MAKE.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.945
YOU GOT BETTER
THINGS TO DO
THAN CHORES,

13:42.112 --> 13:43.655
PUTTING WORDS
DOWN ON PAPER.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.490
NOW YOU CAN DO THAT,
YOU GOT NO BUSINESS
FARMING

13:45.658 --> 13:47.784
OR CHOPPING WOOD
OR PITCHING HAY.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.952
PA, LISTEN TO ME.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.120
I'M ONLY GOING AWAY
FOR A SPELL.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.456
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.042
I CAN DO MY CHORES
AND BE PART OF
THE FAMILY

13:56.210 --> 13:58.711
AND WRITE
MY WORDS, TOO.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.296
WE'RE DIFFERENT, BOY.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.465
YOU AND ME,
WE'RE DIFFERENT.
IT'S LIKE...

14:02.633 --> 14:05.301
LIKE WE LIVE ON TWO
DIFFERENT HILLS WITH
A BIG DITCH BETWEEN US.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.761
I MEAN, YOU'RE
DOING THINGS

14:06.929 --> 14:08.930
I AIN'T GOT
THE FAINTEST NOTION
WHAT THEY ARE.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.765
YOU DON'T
WANT ME, THEN.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.184
I WANT YOU TO BE
WHAT YOU WANT TO BE.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.477
I AIN'T GONNA PULL
YOU UP ON MY HILL

14:14.645 --> 14:17.230
IF YOU WANT
TO STAY ON YOURS.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.691
I CAN'T EVER
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.984
I AIN'T ASKING
FOR THANKS.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.403
IT'S NOT JUST THANKS.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.029
I LOVE MY REAL PA--

14:25.197 --> 14:27.407
I AIN'T A PATCH
ON YOUR PA.
I AIN'T--

14:27.575 --> 14:29.742
NEVER MIND
WHAT YOU AIN'T.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.412
YOU'RE ALL I NEEDED
FOR A FATHER...

14:32.580 --> 14:35.748
AND THEN SOME.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.709
I'LL BE OUT
IN THE FIELD.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.720
MA...

14:48.888 --> 14:51.180
HE'S HURTING OR--
OR MAD OR SOMETHING.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.519
IT'LL PASS.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.689
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

14:59.857 --> 15:01.608
MOST EVERY FATHER
WOULD LIKE HIS SON

15:01.775 --> 15:04.152
TO FOLLOW IN HIS
FOOTSTEPS.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.695
YOU'RE GOING
IN A DIFFERENT
DIRECTION,

15:05.863 --> 15:08.031
AND THAT BOTHERS HIM.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.782
WELL, HE DIDN'T
SAY THAT.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.326
NO.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.662
BUT IT'S STILL
THE PROBLEM.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.874
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.417
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
GO OVER TO
THE INGALLS'

15:19.585 --> 15:22.378
AND GIVE MARY
THE GOOD NEWS?

15:22.546 --> 15:23.838
ALL RIGHT.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.215
BUT I STILL FEEL
LIKE I'M DOING
SOMETHING WRONG.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.009
IT'S THE RIGHTEST
THING YOU EVER DID,

15:28.177 --> 15:29.552
AND DON'T YOU
EVER FORGET IT.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.472
ISAIAH'LL COME TO
KNOW THAT IN TIME.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.223
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.558
THEN GO ON!

15:35.726 --> 15:38.978
MARY'S GOING TO
BE AS HAPPY FOR
YOU AS I AM!

15:39.146 --> 15:40.688
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.343
CHARLES. SHALL
I GO INSIDE?

16:10.511 --> 16:13.262
NO, NO, NO.
GO RIGHT ON WITH
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.597
-JOHN.
-MORNING.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.641
-JOHN, HOW ARE YOU?
-FINE.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.434
COME OVER FOR
A LITTLE TALK,
DID YOU?

16:18.602 --> 16:21.145
WELL, NO, SIR.
I GOT NO TIME.
WHERE'S MARY?

16:21.313 --> 16:22.438
SHE'S OVER
AT THE BIG OAK.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.898
HAD A LITTLE
STUDYING TO DO.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.652
COME ON IN
THE HOUSE WHERE
WE CAN BE ALONE.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.320
HEY, JOHN?

16:29.488 --> 16:31.531
HEY, DON'T YOU WANT
TO HAVE A TALK?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.872
HOW CAN I TELL HIM
HE AND MARY HAVE TO
WAIT A YEAR AND A HALF

16:40.040 --> 16:41.457
IF HE DOESN'T ASK ME?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.045
MARY!

16:48.966 --> 16:50.174
-I GOT GREAT NEWS.
-WHAT IS IT?

16:50.342 --> 16:51.801
I TALKED TO THE MAN
FROM "THE PATHFINDER."

16:51.969 --> 16:54.470
-WHAT'D HE SAY?
-I'M GOING TO
THE UNIVERSITY.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.472
-WHEN?
-THIS FALL.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.057
ONLY ONE BOY
FROM THE WHOLE
DISTRICT,

16:58.225 --> 16:59.559
AND THEY PICKED ME!

16:59.727 --> 17:02.061
HE SAYS I GOT
THE IMAGINATION
AND THE TALENT,

17:02.229 --> 17:03.771
AND I'M GOING TO
MAKE A WRITER
SOMEDAY

17:03.939 --> 17:06.816
LIKE MARK TWAIN
OR ROBERT BURNS.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.027
HOW LONG WILL
YOU BE AWAY?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.154
4 YEARS.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.364
[WHISPERS]
4 YEARS.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.200
I DIDN'T TALK
TO HIM FOR MORE
THAN 5 MINUTES,

17:16.368 --> 17:19.078
AND HE CHANGED
MY WHOLE LIFE.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.621
4 YEARS
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.874
EVERYTHING PAID.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.543
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A UNIVERSITY
LOOKS LIKE.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.712
WONDERFUL,
I EXPECT.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.173
IT'S A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.008
YOU'LL BE GONE
A LONG TIME.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.677
BUT I'LL BE BACK
IN THE SUMMER, THOUGH,
FOR TWO WEEKS,

17:34.845 --> 17:36.554
MAYBE 3!

17:36.722 --> 17:38.806
AND AT CHRISTMAS.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.517
WHY, WE'LL SEE EACH
OTHER TWICE A YEAR!

17:41.685 --> 17:43.061
TWICE A YEAR.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.896
THAT'S BETTER
THAN NOTHING.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.565
WE'LL HAVE SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT!

17:47.733 --> 17:49.150
YOU'LL BE DIFFERENT.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.696
NO, I WON'T.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.032
YOU WILL, TOO.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.825
LIVING IN CHICAGO...

17:57.993 --> 18:00.536
GOING TO
THE UNIVERSITY.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.829
IT'LL BE LIKE
LIVING ON THE MOON

18:01.997 --> 18:03.790
COMPARED TO
WALNUT GROVE.

18:06.460 --> 18:10.129
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

18:10.297 --> 18:11.756
I WANT YOU TO GO.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.885
YOU CAN'T TURN DOWN
4 YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.762
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT, JOHN.

18:17.930 --> 18:22.892
AND YOU'LL BE DIFFERENT,
TOO, WHEN YOU COME BACK
AT CHRISTMAS.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.354
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT ME TO GO?

18:26.522 --> 18:28.856
OF COURSE I DO.

18:29.024 --> 18:32.944
WHEN IT'S DONE,
WE'LL BOTH BE
GLAD YOU DID IT.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.654
I GOT TO GET HOME.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.135
SORRY I MISSED SUPPER.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.305
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

19:01.473 --> 19:04.600
HAVEN'T GIVEN IT
MUCH THOUGHT.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.520
WELL, I'LL FETCH
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.063
THANKS.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.827
THERE'S MORE
IF YOU WANT IT.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.537
THAT'LL BE FINE.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.879
IS IT MARY?

20:20.677 --> 20:21.886
IT'LL WORK.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.137
TAKES TIME, BUT--

20:23.305 --> 20:26.265
THOUGHT MY MIND
WAS MADE UP.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.434
SEEMS LIKE
IT OUGHT TO BE.

20:40.405 --> 20:44.533
YOU'LL RIDE THE WIND
ONE DAY, JOHN.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.495
WILL I?

20:47.663 --> 20:48.955
AND MARY?

20:49.122 --> 20:52.041
WELL, SHE'LL BE HERE,
WAITING FOR YOU.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.378
IF SHE'S FOND ENOUGH
OF YOU, SHE WILL BE.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.796
OH, YOU'RE BOTH
SO YOUNG.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.048
YOU'VE GOT
SO MUCH TO DO,
SO MUCH TO LEARN.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.050
I KNOW.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.885
I KNOW ALL THAT.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.889
KNOWING DOESN'T
MAKE IT ANY EASIER.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.476
WHAT'LL I BE
WHEN I COME BACK?

21:10.644 --> 21:11.769
WILL I BE THE SAME?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.813
NO.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.190
NEITHER WILL SHE.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.317
SHE'S A GIRL NOW.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.568
SHE'LL BE
A WOMAN THEN,

21:19.736 --> 21:21.237
AND YOU'LL BE A MAN.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.532
AND YOU'LL SEE
EACH OTHER WITH
DIFFERENT EYES.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.327
THAT'S WHAT
I'M AFRAID OF.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.539
I DON'T WANT THINGS
TO CHANGE.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.499
BUT THEY DO, JOHN.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.627
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.879
OH, THERE'S A GREAT,
BIG WORLD OUT THERE

21:39.047 --> 21:41.090
WAITING FOR YOU, JOHN.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.718
LIKE AN ENORMOUS HOUSE
WITH A MILLION ROOMS

21:43.885 --> 21:46.053
ALL FILLED
WITH TREASURES,

21:46.221 --> 21:49.348
AND AT THE UNIVERSITY,
THEY'LL GIVE YOU
THE KEYS.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.562
WHAT ABOUT MARY?

21:54.730 --> 21:57.523
SHE'S A VERY
BRIGHT GIRL.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.774
NO TELLING WHAT
SHE MIGHT DO

21:58.942 --> 22:02.862
IF SHE SETS
HER MIND TO IT.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.114
BUT IF I GO AWAY...

22:05.282 --> 22:09.118
I--I'LL LOSE HER.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.078
MAYBE.

22:11.246 --> 22:14.749
THINGS WON'T BE
THE SAME AGAIN.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.293
THINGS NEVER
ARE THE SAME.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.135
DON'T FRET
ABOUT IT, JOHN.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.929
GOOD NIGHT.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.910
JOHN, BREAKFAST
IS READY!

23:04.716 --> 23:06.884
PUT IT ON THE TABLE.
BE CAREFUL.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.969
SIT DOWN.
BREAKFAST
IS ALL READY.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.138
I GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.978
I, UH, DONE MY THINKING
AND MADE MY DECISION.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.857
I'M NOT GOING
TO TAKE IT.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.067
Grace:
OH, JOHN!

23:23.235 --> 23:25.403
John: MY MIND'S MADE UP.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.696
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
ALL LAST NIGHT.

23:27.864 --> 23:32.535
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
AND FARM WITH ISAIAH.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.120
I COULD SPEND
4 YEARS AT
THE UNIVERSITY

23:34.287 --> 23:36.914
AND NOT BECOME
A WRITER AFTER ALL.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.416
NOBODY'S PROMISING
ANYTHING.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.875
YOU DON'T NEED
PROMISES.

23:40.043 --> 23:43.129
ALL YOU WANT
IS AN OPPORTUNITY!

23:43.296 --> 23:45.131
I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY
HERE.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.549
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

23:46.716 --> 23:49.343
-WHAT YOU'RE GIVING UP?
-I THINK SO.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.262
YOU HAVEN'T
THE FAINTEST
NOTION, JOHN!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.889
THEY'RE OFFERING
YOU THE WORLD!

23:54.057 --> 23:57.518
MY WORLD'S RIGHT HERE.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.562
I MADE MY DECISION.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.063
NOW I'M GOING
TO GO HAYING.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.898
NEVER MIND ABOUT
THE HAYING. I'LL
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.483
YOU GO GET YOUR GAL.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.986
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.696
I HOPE SO.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.075
I WONDER,
THOUGH...

36:44.243 --> 36:46.912
WHAT?

36:47.079 --> 36:49.372
HE USED TO SMILE.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.652
KIND OF LATE,
ISN'T IT?

37:18.819 --> 37:23.198
I KNOW.
I'M NOT SLEEPY.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.908
JOHN'S POEMS.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.453
HE GAVE THEM TO GRACE,
BUT SHE THOUGHT
I'D LIKE TO READ THEM.

37:33.876 --> 37:36.711
"MEADOWLARK."

37:36.879 --> 37:39.256
"WINTER KILL."

37:39.423 --> 37:40.548
"CHARLIE'S FIDDLE"?

37:40.716 --> 37:42.300
THAT'S ABOUT PA.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.726
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

37:51.894 --> 37:53.061
HOW DOES HE PUT
INTO WORDS

37:53.229 --> 37:54.437
EXACTLY WHAT I HEAR

37:54.605 --> 37:58.900
AND FEEL WHEN I HEAR
YOUR PA PLAY?

37:59.068 --> 38:00.860
EVER ASK HIM?

38:01.028 --> 38:03.405
WE DON'T TALK MUCH
ABOUT POETRY.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.448
OTHER THINGS
ON HIS MIND, HMM?

38:05.616 --> 38:07.242
HE'S AWFUL BUSY.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.327
HMM.

38:09.495 --> 38:13.123
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE
AND GET MARRIED.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.583
YOU ENTER
A WHOLE NEW WORLD,

38:15.751 --> 38:18.003
AND YOU LEAVE
THE OLD ONE BEHIND.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.629

38:19.797 --> 38:23.633
SURE. HAPPENS
TO EVERYBODY.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.344
WHAT KIND OF A WORLD
DID YOU LEAVE BEHIND?

38:26.512 --> 38:28.305
CAN'T REMEMBER.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.309
OH, IF I THINK BACK
TO THE TIME

38:32.476 --> 38:35.520
BEFORE I MET AND
MARRIED YOUR PA...

38:38.733 --> 38:40.608
IT'S LIKE I...

38:40.776 --> 38:44.112
DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT GIRL.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.907
THE THINGS SHE
WANTED TO DO...

38:48.075 --> 38:52.287
PLACES SHE WANTED
TO GO.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.998
THE PERSON SHE
WANTED TO BE.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.548
THINGS CHANGE SO.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.759
YOU GET MARRIED...

39:07.178 --> 39:10.055
AND YOU HAVE ONE ANOTHER
TO LOOK OUT FOR...

39:10.222 --> 39:12.390
HOUSE TO BUILD...

39:12.558 --> 39:14.934
CROPS TO GROW...

39:15.102 --> 39:17.645
CHILDREN TO RAISE,

39:17.813 --> 39:19.981
FEED, AND CLOTHE.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.443
BILLS TO PAY.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.904
AND THAT'LL HAPPEN
TO US, TOO?

39:28.157 --> 39:30.158
BUT YOU'LL BE GLAD

39:30.326 --> 39:33.286
FOR ALL OF IT.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.830
YOU LEAVE ONE
WORLD BEHIND,

39:35.998 --> 39:39.250
AND YOU GO ON
TO THE NEW...

39:39.418 --> 39:40.835
AND YOU FORGET
THE DREAMS YOU HAD

39:41.003 --> 39:43.046
BEFORE IT
ALL HAPPENED.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.673
WILL JOHN FORGET
HIS POETRY?

39:45.841 --> 39:47.509
WELL...

39:49.929 --> 39:53.223

PLAYS HIS FIDDLE,
DOESN'T HE?

39:58.687 --> 40:02.023
DON'T FRET ABOUT IT.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.359
IT HAPPENS TO
ALL OF US, MARY.

GOOD NIGHT.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.705

BUT IT'S COMING.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.003
GOING TO HAVE A NICE
FIELD DOWN THERE,
YOU AND JOHN.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.754
WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO NEXT,

41:06.922 --> 41:09.424
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND
OF DOOR YOU WANT.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.758
SOLID FROM TOP
TO BOTTOM,

41:10.926 --> 41:12.594

ONE OF THEM

41:12.761 --> 41:14.095

THROUGH THE TOP

41:14.263 --> 41:16.931
AND KEEP THE VARMINTS
OUT WITH THE BOTTOM.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.769
I LOVED IT.

41:21.937 --> 41:24.814
I'D FALL ASLEEP
THINKING ABOUT IT,

41:24.982 --> 41:27.942
THEN I'D DREAM
ABOUT IT...

41:28.110 --> 41:31.362
A GREEN FIELD
DOWN THERE...

41:31.530 --> 41:33.615
NEW WHEAT COMING UP
IN THE SPRING...

41:33.782 --> 41:36.326

DREAM.

IT WAS, A DREAM.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.297
AND A CHICKEN HOUSE.

TALKING ABOUT?

HOW TO START.

MATTER, MARY?

HERE IS WRONG.

42:16.242 --> 42:21.037

IN THE BEGINNING
WAS WRONG.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.748

WRONG ABOUT IT!

42:23.916 --> 42:25.291

HIM DOWN THERE.

BUSTED BY SUNDOWN
TOMORROW.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.005

A GOOD FARMER
DOWN THERE.

ALL FOR YOU.

WRONG ABOUT IT.

FOR ME AND FOR YOU,

42:36.887 --> 42:39.097
NOT FOR HIMSELF.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.224
HE ISN'T A FARMER.

42:41.392 --> 42:44.811
HE WASN'T BORN
TO BE A FARMER.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.313
HE WAS BORN FOR THIS.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.192
HE WAS BORN TO BOOKS

MAKE WITH THEM.
