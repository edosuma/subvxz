WEBVTT

00:29.989 --> 00:34.077
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

00:34.452 --> 00:38.915
<i>We kidnap and ravage
And don't give a hoot</i>

00:39.082 --> 00:42.919
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

00:43.086 --> 00:46.339
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

00:46.506 --> 00:49.175
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

00:50.176 --> 00:55.348
<i>We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack
Drink up--</i>

00:55.515 --> 00:56.933
Quiet, missy.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.227
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

00:59.394 --> 01:01.229
You don't wanna bring them
down on us, do you?

01:01.396 --> 01:03.231
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.317
She was singing about pirates.

01:06.484 --> 01:10.154
Bad luck to be singing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog,

01:10.321 --> 01:13.866
- mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.995
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.122
It's bad luck to have a woman
on board too.

01:19.706 --> 01:22.292
Even a miniature one.

01:22.584 --> 01:25.044
I think it would be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.840
Think again, Miss Swann.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.176
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.971
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

01:35.138 --> 01:38.808
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves:

01:38.975 --> 01:41.019
A short drop and a sudden stop.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.191
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervour,

01:47.358 --> 01:52.322
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.365
My apologies, Governor Swann.

01:54.532 --> 01:58.328
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- Yes, that's what concerns me.

02:26.731 --> 02:28.983
Look, a boy. There's a boy in the water.

02:31.778 --> 02:33.363
Man overboard!

02:34.822 --> 02:36.449
Man the ropes. Fetch a hook.

02:37.283 --> 02:39.369
Haul him aboard.

02:47.502 --> 02:52.256
- He's still breathing.
- Mary, Mother of God.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.430
What happened here?

03:00.932 --> 03:05.103
It was most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.272
A lot of good it did them.

03:09.107 --> 03:10.900
Everyone's thinking it. I'm just saying it.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.695
Pirates.

03:14.612 --> 03:18.324
There's no proof of that.
It was probably an accident.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.411
- Rouse the captain immediately.
- Aye, sir.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.830
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.039
Heave to.

03:26.999 --> 03:30.128
Elizabeth,
I want you to accompany the boy.

03:30.294 --> 03:34.340
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

03:53.359 --> 03:57.113
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.949
Will Turner.

04:00.992 --> 04:02.785
I'm watching over you, Will.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.550
You're a pirate.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.510
Has he said anything?

04:19.677 --> 04:22.805
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.017
Take him below.

05:35.545 --> 05:37.213
Elizabeth?

05:39.173 --> 05:41.008
Are you all right?

05:41.884 --> 05:46.639
- Are you decent?
- Yes. Yes.

05:46.806 --> 05:49.892
You still abed at this hour?

05:50.935 --> 05:52.937
It's a beautiful day.

05:54.272 --> 05:56.774
I have a gift for you.

05:59.110 --> 06:02.697
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

06:03.781 --> 06:05.825
May I enquire as to the occasion?

06:05.992 --> 06:09.745
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

06:10.580 --> 06:12.164
Go on.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.128
Actually, I--

06:18.212 --> 06:20.548
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.008
The ceremony?

06:22.174 --> 06:24.760
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.304
I knew it.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.140
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

06:29.807 --> 06:33.436
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.690
Elizabeth? How's it coming'?

06:37.899 --> 06:40.234
It's difficult to say.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.278
I'm told it's the latest fashion in London.

06:42.445 --> 06:46.240
Well, women in London
must have learned not to breathe.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.285
My lord, you have a visitor.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.600
- Mr. Turner, good to see you again.
- Good day, sir.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.310
I have your order.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.818
The blade is folded steel.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.572
That's gold filigree laid into the handle.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.866
If <i>I</i> may?

07:30.701 --> 07:35.414
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the full width of the blade.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.671
Impressive. Very impressive.
Well, now.

07:41.837 --> 07:45.132
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.344
Do pass my compliments
on to your master.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.515
I Shall.

07:53.057 --> 07:57.061
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.565
Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning.

08:01.732 --> 08:06.195
Will. It's so good to see you.

08:06.570 --> 08:09.407
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.534
Elizabeth, is that entirely proper
for you to--?

08:11.701 --> 08:13.369
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.705
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

08:15.871 --> 08:18.290
Will, how many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

08:19.041 --> 08:22.545
At least once more, Miss Swann,
as always.

08:22.712 --> 08:25.673
There, you see?
At least the boy has a sense of propriety.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.592
Now, we really must be going.
There you are.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.178
Good day, Mr. Turner.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.765
Come along.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.977
Good day...

08:41.313 --> 08:42.732
...Elizabeth.

10:12.363 --> 10:16.325
What--? Hold up there, you.

10:16.784 --> 10:21.122
It's a shilling to tie up your boat
at the dock.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.791
And I shall need to know your name.

10:26.544 --> 10:30.089
What do you say to 3 shillings
and we forget the name?

10:34.051 --> 10:36.720
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.091
Two paces, march!

11:16.927 --> 11:18.596
Right about face!

11:21.640 --> 11:25.102
Present arms!

11:48.209 --> 11:52.463
- This dock is off-limits to civilians.
- I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

11:52.630 --> 11:55.507
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

11:59.136 --> 12:02.640
Apparently, there's some sort of
high-toned and fancy to do up at the fort.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.976
How could it be two upstanding gentlemen
such as yourselves

12:06.143 --> 12:08.020
did not merit an invitation?

12:08.938 --> 12:11.857
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

12:12.024 --> 12:17.488
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me a ship like that

12:18.030 --> 12:21.325
makes this one here a bit superfluous,
really.

12:21.492 --> 12:24.286
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.623
But there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

12:27.790 --> 12:32.253
I've heard of one. Supposed to be
very fast, nigh uncatchable.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.088
<i>The Black Pearl.</i>

12:35.172 --> 12:40.386
Well, there's no real ship
that could match the Interceptor.

12:41.095 --> 12:44.682
<i>- Black Pearl is a real ship.
- No. No, it's not.</i>

12:44.848 --> 12:46.600
Yes, it is. I've seen it.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.978
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.147
- You haven't seen it.
- Yes, I have.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.567
You've seen a ship with black sails

12:55.734 --> 12:59.989
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

13:00.155 --> 13:03.325
that hell itself spat him back out?

13:03.492 --> 13:05.703
- No.
- No.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.706
But I have seen a ship with black sails.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.875
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed
by the damned

13:12.042 --> 13:14.795
and captained by a man so evil
that hell itself spat him out

13:14.962 --> 13:16.380
could possibly have black sails.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.383
Therefore it couldn't possibly be
any other ship than the <i>Black</i> Pearl.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.510
Is that what you're saying?

13:22.219 --> 13:23.345
No.

13:23.804 --> 13:29.184
Like I said, there's no real ship
that could match the Interceptor.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.438
Hey!

13:32.855 --> 13:33.897
You!

13:34.982 --> 13:36.108
Get away from there.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.527
You don't have permission
to be aboard there, mate.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.363
I'm sorry. It's just--
It's such a pretty boat. Ship.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.115
What's your name?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.868
Smith. Or Smitty, if you like.

13:46.035 --> 13:49.288
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr. Smith?

13:49.455 --> 13:53.000
- And no lies.
- Why, then I confess.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.212
It is my intention to commandeer one
of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga,

13:57.379 --> 14:00.215
raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

14:00.924 --> 14:04.136
- I said no lies.
- I think he's telling the truth.

14:04.762 --> 14:07.848
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.602
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
believe the truth, even if he told it to you.

14:22.363 --> 14:23.697
May I have a moment?

14:32.915 --> 14:35.626
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

14:37.294 --> 14:43.384
I apologise if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

14:45.594 --> 14:51.058
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.270
A marriage to a fine woman.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.025
You have become a fine woman,
Elizabeth.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.947
- I can't breathe.
- Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.369
And then they made me their chief.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.206
Elizabeth?

15:16.417 --> 15:18.585
Elizabeth!

15:19.503 --> 15:22.589
- The rocks.
- Sir, it's a miracle she missed them.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.053
- Will you be saving her then?
- I can't swim.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.891
Pride of the King's Navy, you are.
Do not lose these.

15:47.823 --> 15:49.700
What was that?

16:23.358 --> 16:25.194
Make way.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.660
I got her.

16:34.495 --> 16:35.996
- She's not breathing.
- Move.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.963
I never would have thought of that.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.841
Clearly,
you've never been to Singapore.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.431
Where did you get that?

16:56.517 --> 16:58.060
On your feet.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.480
Elizabeth.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.192
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.073
- Shoot him.
- Father.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.366
- What?
- Commodore,

17:12.824 --> 17:14.451
do you really intend
to kill my rescuer?

17:21.959 --> 17:24.670
I believe thanks are in order.

17:28.382 --> 17:31.468
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

17:33.804 --> 17:35.055
Hang him.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.016
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

17:39.309 --> 17:45.816
- Well, well, Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please.

17:45.983 --> 17:51.280
- Well, I don't see your ship, captain.
- I'm in the market, as it were.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.156
He said he came to commandeer one.

17:53.323 --> 17:57.119
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.791
No additional shots nor powder.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.461
A compass that doesn't point north.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.427
And I half-expected it
to be made of wood.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.558
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've ever heard of.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.977
But you have heard of me.

18:25.022 --> 18:27.524
Commodore, I really must protest.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.151
Carefully, lieutenant.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.486
Pirate or not, this man saved my life.

18:31.653 --> 18:35.073
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.867
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.368
Indeed.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.622
Finally.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.834
- No. No, don't shoot.
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.962
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

18:50.756 --> 18:51.965
Commodore.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.679
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it'?
- It's Miss Swann.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.515
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind?

19:00.682 --> 19:03.018
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

19:04.645 --> 19:05.896
Now, if you'll be very kind.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.373
Easy on the goods, darling.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.250
You're despicable.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.336
Sticks and stones, love.

19:29.503 --> 19:32.005
I saved your life, you save mine,
we're square.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.883
Gentlemen, my lady,

19:35.717 --> 19:37.344
you will always remember this
as the day

19:37.511 --> 19:41.723
that you almost caught
Captain Jack Sparrow.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.537
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

20:10.961 --> 20:12.254
On his heels.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.599
- Take steady aim.
- Fire! Fire!

20:27.811 --> 20:30.564
- Fire.
- Take care of him. Fire!

20:30.731 --> 20:35.026
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow
has a dawn appointment with the gallows.

20:35.193 --> 20:37.696
I would hate for him to miss it.

20:40.991 --> 20:46.037
Search upstairs. Look lively, men.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.340
Right where I left you.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.682
Not where I left you.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.403
You're the one they're hunting.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.947
The pirate.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.491
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

22:47.117 --> 22:49.953
I make a point of avoiding familiarity
with pirates.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.790
Well, it would be a shame
to put a black mark on your record.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.709
So if you'll excuse me?

22:59.546 --> 23:04.885
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.595
You threatened Miss Swann.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.058
Only a little.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.699
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.327
But how's your footwork?

23:31.286 --> 23:32.495
If I step here--

23:33.955 --> 23:37.375
Very good. And now I step again.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.215
Ta.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.029
That is a wonderful trick.

24:06.321 --> 24:09.991
Except once again, you are between me
and my way out.

24:10.158 --> 24:13.203
And now you have no weapon.

24:35.684 --> 24:37.185
Who makes all these?

24:38.895 --> 24:39.980
I do.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.942
And I practise with them
three hours a day.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.404
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

24:54.619 --> 24:57.622
Or perhaps the reason you practise
three hours a day

24:57.789 --> 24:59.499
is that you already found one

24:59.666 --> 25:03.336
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.714
You're not a eunuch, are you?

25:05.880 --> 25:10.176
I practise three hours a day so that
when I meet a pirate, I can kill him.

26:27.462 --> 26:28.505
You cheated.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.840
Pirate.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.428
- Move away.
- No.

26:35.929 --> 26:37.722
- Please move?
- No.

26:37.889 --> 26:40.809
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.313
This shot is not meant for you.

26:46.147 --> 26:47.690
Come on.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.368
There he is. Over here.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.580
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

27:02.747 --> 27:05.500
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.877
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.464
Well, I trust that you will always remember
this as the day

27:11.631 --> 27:16.678
that Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped. Take him away.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.726
- Hey, come on.
- Can you smell it, boy?

27:23.893 --> 27:25.353
- Smell the bone.
- Come here, boy.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.397
- Come on.
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

27:27.897 --> 27:29.607
- Come here, boy.
- Come on.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.943
- Come here, boy.
- You can keep doing that forever,

27:32.110 --> 27:34.320
the dog is never going to move.

27:34.487 --> 27:38.825
Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

27:45.331 --> 27:49.711
There you go, miss.
It was a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

27:49.878 --> 27:52.505
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose

27:52.672 --> 27:54.799
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

27:54.966 --> 27:59.637
Well, I meant your being threatened
by that pirate. It sounds terrifying.

28:00.805 --> 28:02.390
Yes, it was terrifying.

28:02.557 --> 28:05.810
But the commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

28:05.977 --> 28:09.647
Now, that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.150
It is a smart match.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.153
He's a fine man.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.947
The sort any woman should dream
of marrying.

28:19.115 --> 28:22.577
Well, that Will Turner,
he's a fine man too.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.371
That is too bold.

28:25.538 --> 28:29.584
Oh, begging your pardon, miss.
It was not my place.

29:18.091 --> 29:21.094
Has my daughter given you
an answer yet?

29:21.261 --> 29:22.929
No, she hasn't.

29:23.096 --> 29:26.391
Well, she has had a very trying day.

29:27.058 --> 29:32.146
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Bleak. Very bleak.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.482
What's that?

29:35.024 --> 29:36.067
Cannon fire!

29:38.278 --> 29:40.113
Return fire.

29:40.697 --> 29:43.491
- I know those guns.
- Men to arms.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.206
<i>It's the Pearl.</i>

29:50.748 --> 29:52.750
<i>The Black Pearl?</i>

29:54.502 --> 29:56.004
I've heard stories.

29:56.170 --> 30:00.049
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for near ten years.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.928
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

30:04.095 --> 30:06.180
Then where do the stories come from,
I wonder?

30:15.606 --> 30:17.567
Clear the dock!

30:31.247 --> 30:32.457
Mama!

30:39.339 --> 30:40.673
Mind your oars.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.930
Come on, you.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.892
I need that to see.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.874
Come back.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.442
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes.

31:41.609 --> 31:46.114
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.450
Governor.
Barricade yourself in my office.

31:50.451 --> 31:53.079
- Good God.
- That's an order.

32:11.431 --> 32:12.682
Don't!

32:13.266 --> 32:14.475
Hello, chum.

32:18.688 --> 32:20.064
Up there.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.535
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

32:32.702 --> 32:34.912
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.873
Come on, in here.

32:38.374 --> 32:39.667
Listen, they haven't seen you.

32:39.834 --> 32:42.795
Go hide and the first chance you can,
run to the fort.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.556
- No!
- Gotcha. Had enough?

32:59.061 --> 33:00.563
No, no. It's hot.

33:00.730 --> 33:03.024
- I'm burning.
- Come on.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.155
Come on, you mates.

33:46.442 --> 33:50.279
We know you're here, poppet.

33:50.446 --> 33:53.115
- Poppet.
- Come out.

33:53.616 --> 33:56.827
And we promise we won't hurt you.

33:58.788 --> 34:01.749
We will find you, poppet.

34:01.916 --> 34:07.213
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

34:11.801 --> 34:14.679
The gold calls to us.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.889
The gold, the gold.

34:23.353 --> 34:24.897
Hello, poppet.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.358
Paﬂey!

34:27.733 --> 34:29.485
- What?
- Parley.

34:29.652 --> 34:30.987
I invoke the right of parley.

34:31.779 --> 34:34.991
According to the Code of the Brethren,
set down by Morgan and Bartholomew,

34:35.157 --> 34:38.159
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.661
If an adversary demands parley,

34:39.829 --> 34:42.164
you can do then no harm
until the parley is complete.

34:42.331 --> 34:45.835
- To blazes with the code.
- She wants to be taken to the captain.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.339
And she'll go without a fuss.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.717
We must honour the code.

35:04.478 --> 35:05.730
Say goodbye.

35:10.443 --> 35:11.694
Goodbye.

35:16.198 --> 35:17.575
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.329
Hello.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.587
Out of my way, scum.

35:41.349 --> 35:44.143
My sympathies, friend.
You've no matter of luck at all.

36:06.707 --> 36:08.000
Come on, doggie.

36:08.376 --> 36:11.545
It's just you and me now.
It's you and old Jack.

36:11.712 --> 36:14.173
Come on. Come on, that's it, boy.

36:14.632 --> 36:16.425
Good boy. Come and get the bone.

36:16.926 --> 36:18.094
That's a good boy. Come on.

36:18.552 --> 36:22.431
A bit closer. A bit closer.
That's it. That's it, doggie.

36:22.598 --> 36:25.976
Come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy cur.

36:26.727 --> 36:31.357
Oh, no. Don't do that.
No, no, no, I didn't mean it. I didn't--

36:32.316 --> 36:33.859
Gotcha.

36:37.780 --> 36:40.157
This ain't the armoury.

36:40.741 --> 36:44.912
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.

36:45.079 --> 36:48.165
Captain Jack Sparrow.

36:48.332 --> 36:55.047
Last time I saw you, you were all alone
on a godforsaken island

36:55.214 --> 36:57.299
shrinking into the distance.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.885
His fortunes aren't improved much.

37:00.052 --> 37:03.305
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

37:03.472 --> 37:08.519
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.692
So there is a curse.

37:16.068 --> 37:20.197
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of hell.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.583
That's very interesting.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.451
No!

38:05.618 --> 38:07.870
I didn't know we was taking on captives.

38:08.037 --> 38:10.998
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

38:11.165 --> 38:14.919
- I'm here to negotiate--
- You will speak when spoken to.

38:16.086 --> 38:20.925
And ye'll not lay a hand
on those under the protection of parley.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.093
Aye, sir.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.889
My apologies, miss.

38:28.057 --> 38:30.059
Captain Barbossa,

38:30.226 --> 38:33.771
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.649
There were a lot of long words
in there, miss.

38:36.816 --> 38:41.570
We're nought but humble pirates.
What is it that you want?

38:41.737 --> 38:44.824
I want you to leave
and never come back.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.994
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.915
Means no.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.292
Very well.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.046
<i>I'll drop it.</i>

39:04.051 --> 39:09.723
Me holds are bursting with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us? Why?

39:10.850 --> 39:13.394
It's what you've been searching for.

39:13.769 --> 39:17.106
I recognise this ship. I saw it eight years
ago on the crossing from England.

39:17.815 --> 39:19.859
Did you, now?

39:22.027 --> 39:23.654
Fine.

39:23.904 --> 39:26.991
Well, I suppose if it is worthless,
then there's no point in me keeping it.

39:27.825 --> 39:29.410
No.

39:39.712 --> 39:41.881
You have a name, missy?

39:42.923 --> 39:46.427
Elizabeth Turner.

39:46.969 --> 39:49.597
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.476
Miss Turner.

39:54.894 --> 39:58.063
- Turner?
- Bootstrap.

40:01.317 --> 40:03.903
And how does a maid come to own
a trinket such as that?

40:04.069 --> 40:06.697
Family heirloom perhaps?

40:07.489 --> 40:09.241
I didn't steal it if that's what you mean.

40:10.784 --> 40:13.579
Very well. You hand it over
and we'll put your town to our rudder

40:13.746 --> 40:15.164
and ne'er return.

40:29.136 --> 40:31.013
Our bargain?

40:33.182 --> 40:36.560
Still the guns and stow them.
Signal the men. Set the flags.

40:36.727 --> 40:39.772
- Make good to clear port.
- Wait. You have to take me to shore.

40:39.939 --> 40:42.149
- According to the Code of the Order--
- First,

40:42.691 --> 40:45.653
your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreement,

40:45.819 --> 40:47.154
so I must do nothing.

40:47.321 --> 40:50.824
And secondly, you must be a pirate for
the Pirates' Code to apply, and you're not.

40:50.991 --> 40:56.538
And thirdly, the Code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

40:56.705 --> 40:59.625
Welcome aboard the <i>Black</i> Pearl,
Miss Turner.

41:21.105 --> 41:22.856
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.610
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

41:26.902 --> 41:28.696
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

41:29.279 --> 41:31.865
And where do you propose we start?

41:32.032 --> 41:35.786
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, please share it.

41:37.997 --> 41:39.873
That Jack Sparrow,

41:40.874 --> 41:44.128
- he talked about the <i>Black</i> Pearl.
- Mentioned it is more what he did.

41:45.838 --> 41:48.799
Ask him where it is. Make a deal with him.
He could lead us to it.

41:48.966 --> 41:53.762
No. The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell.

41:53.929 --> 41:56.849
Ergo, they are not his allies.

41:57.016 --> 41:59.768
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course and launch--

41:59.935 --> 42:01.812
That's not good enough!

42:02.312 --> 42:03.856
Mr. Turner,

42:04.690 --> 42:07.443
you are not a military man.
You are not a sailor.

42:08.569 --> 42:09.820
You are a blacksmith.

42:09.987 --> 42:13.949
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.785
Do not make the mistake of thinking

42:16.952 --> 42:19.621
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

42:24.793 --> 42:27.588
Please, please.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.053
- You, Sparrow.
- Aye?

42:34.219 --> 42:36.930
You're familiar with that ship,
the <i>Black Pearl?</i>

42:37.473 --> 42:39.600
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

42:39.767 --> 42:42.853
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

42:45.856 --> 42:49.693
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

42:49.860 --> 42:52.488
sail from the dreaded lsla de Muerta.

42:52.654 --> 42:55.449
It's an island that cannot be found,

42:55.783 --> 42:58.035
except by those
who already know where it is.

42:58.494 --> 43:00.579
The ship's real enough.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.248
Therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where is it?

43:04.166 --> 43:05.417
Why ask me?

43:06.210 --> 43:07.669
Because you're a pirate.

43:07.836 --> 43:10.798
And you want to turn pirate yourself,
is that it?

43:11.882 --> 43:13.467
Never.

43:16.428 --> 43:20.015
- They took Miss Swann.
- Oh, so it is that you found a girl.

43:20.182 --> 43:21.892
I see.

43:22.059 --> 43:24.520
Well, if you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

43:24.686 --> 43:29.775
and so win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

43:29.942 --> 43:31.568
I see no profit in it for me.

43:32.611 --> 43:35.614
- I can get you out of here.
- How's that? The key's run off.

43:36.198 --> 43:37.324
I helped build these cells.

43:37.950 --> 43:40.119
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

43:41.578 --> 43:44.706
With the right leverage
and the proper application of strength,

43:45.958 --> 43:47.251
the door will lift free.

43:49.670 --> 43:50.921
What's your name?

43:51.797 --> 43:52.923
Will Turner.

43:54.258 --> 43:58.554
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good strong name.

43:58.720 --> 44:00.722
No doubt named for your father, eh?

44:02.391 --> 44:03.433
Yes.

44:06.270 --> 44:09.398
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

44:09.565 --> 44:12.651
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death,

44:12.818 --> 44:16.864
I shall take you to the <i>Black Pearl</i>
and your bonnie lass.

44:17.030 --> 44:19.241
Do we have an accord?

44:22.411 --> 44:23.996
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

44:24.163 --> 44:25.622
Get me out.

44:28.792 --> 44:32.504
- Hurry. Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

44:39.136 --> 44:41.263
We're gonna steal the ship.

44:42.723 --> 44:45.267
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

44:45.434 --> 44:48.770
We're gonna commandeer that ship.
Nautical term.

44:49.771 --> 44:52.941
One question about your business, boy,
or there's no use going.

44:53.108 --> 44:57.446
This girl,
how far are you willing to go to save her?

44:57.613 --> 45:02.159
- I'd die for her.
- Oh, good. No worries, then.

45:21.303 --> 45:24.556
This is either madness or brilliance.

45:24.723 --> 45:28.185
It's remarkable
how often those two traits coincide.

45:57.881 --> 46:01.635
Everyone, stay calm.
We are taking over the ship.

46:01.802 --> 46:03.720
Aye. Avast.

46:06.765 --> 46:09.768
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

46:09.935 --> 46:11.603
You'll never make it out of the bay.

46:12.521 --> 46:13.897
Son,

46:14.356 --> 46:17.192
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

46:17.651 --> 46:18.819
Savvy?

46:22.406 --> 46:26.785
- Commodore.
- Sir, they've taken the Dauntless.

46:27.953 --> 46:32.124
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

46:32.332 --> 46:34.418
Sparrow and Turner,
they've taken the Dauntless.

46:34.584 --> 46:37.629
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

46:39.298 --> 46:43.677
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.015
Here they come.

46:52.769 --> 46:56.023
Bring her around! Bring her around!

46:56.189 --> 46:59.234
- Hold on!
- Grab on!

47:02.029 --> 47:04.114
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

47:04.281 --> 47:06.158
This way, men.

47:18.045 --> 47:20.756
- Check the aft.
- And the portside.

47:20.922 --> 47:23.675
- Sailors, back to the Interceptor, now.
- Quickly, men.

47:30.307 --> 47:33.643
Thank you, commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

47:33.810 --> 47:36.271
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.651
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.945
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them.

47:44.112 --> 47:46.740
I don't need to catch them.
Get them in range of the long nines.

47:46.907 --> 47:49.368
Helm, come about! Run out the guns!

47:50.994 --> 47:53.538
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

47:53.705 --> 47:58.126
I'd rather see her at the bottom
of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

47:58.668 --> 48:02.005
Commodore.
He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

48:05.842 --> 48:07.761
Abandon ship!

48:11.723 --> 48:14.017
- Let go the gear and sheet home.
- Sheet home, aye, sir.

48:14.184 --> 48:17.604
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

48:17.771 --> 48:20.273
So it would seem.

48:29.032 --> 48:32.911
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

48:33.078 --> 48:37.624
After she died, I came out here
looking for my father.

48:38.333 --> 48:39.459
Is that so?

48:41.253 --> 48:43.588
My father? Bill Turner?

48:44.131 --> 48:47.217
In the jail, it was only after you learned
my name that you agreed to help.

48:47.384 --> 48:49.553
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

48:49.719 --> 48:51.721
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

48:52.139 --> 48:53.807
You knew my father.

48:59.855 --> 49:04.276
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

49:04.443 --> 49:07.362
Everyone else just called him Bootstrap
or Bootstrap Bill.

49:07.529 --> 49:08.572
Bootstrap?

49:09.614 --> 49:14.202
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

49:14.369 --> 49:17.164
It's not true.
He was a merchant sailor.

49:17.330 --> 49:19.499
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.710
He was a bloody pirate. A scallywag.

49:23.170 --> 49:26.923
My father was not a pirate.

49:27.090 --> 49:31.011
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

49:31.344 --> 49:32.512
You didn't beat me.

49:32.679 --> 49:35.599
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

49:35.765 --> 49:38.685
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, then, is it'?

49:45.942 --> 49:49.112
Now, as long as you're just hanging there,
pay attention.

49:49.279 --> 49:52.032
The only rules that really matter
are these:

49:52.199 --> 49:55.619
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

49:56.244 --> 50:00.540
For instance, you can accept that
your father was a pirate and a good man,

50:00.707 --> 50:03.210
or you can't.
But pirate is in your blood, boy,

50:03.376 --> 50:05.420
so you'll have to square with that
someday.

50:06.213 --> 50:09.299
Now, me, for example,
I can let you drown

50:09.466 --> 50:13.011
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

50:13.678 --> 50:15.263
So.

50:19.434 --> 50:22.729
Can you sail
under the command of a pirate?

50:23.980 --> 50:26.024
Or can you not?

50:28.068 --> 50:29.110
Toﬂuga?

50:30.028 --> 50:31.279
Toﬂuga.

50:53.802 --> 50:55.971
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

50:56.137 --> 50:59.015
that has never breathed deep
the sweet, proliferous bouquet

50:59.182 --> 51:01.601
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

51:02.352 --> 51:04.229
What do you think?

51:07.816 --> 51:08.858
It'll linger.

51:09.025 --> 51:10.610
I'll tell you, mate

51:10.777 --> 51:13.321
if every town in the world
were like this one,

51:13.488 --> 51:15.490
no man would ever feel unwanted.

51:17.325 --> 51:18.493
Scarlett.

51:20.620 --> 51:21.746
Not sure I deserved that.

51:23.623 --> 51:25.000
Giselle.

51:25.166 --> 51:26.793
- Who was she?
- What?

51:29.212 --> 51:30.463
I may have deserved that.

51:32.799 --> 51:35.010
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot.

51:38.388 --> 51:42.100
Mother's love. Jack.

51:42.350 --> 51:45.395
You should know better
than to wake a man when he's sleeping.

51:45.562 --> 51:49.357
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

51:49.524 --> 51:52.902
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

51:53.069 --> 51:55.822
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to a proposition

51:55.989 --> 51:58.116
from the man who did the waking.

52:00.285 --> 52:02.120
Aye. That'll about do it.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.252
Blast, I'm already awake!

52:09.669 --> 52:11.630
That was for the smell.

52:21.181 --> 52:23.391
Keep a sharp eye.

52:30.190 --> 52:34.486
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of yours?

52:35.278 --> 52:37.364
I'm going after the <i>Black</i> Pearl.

52:41.117 --> 52:44.537
I know where it's going to be
and I'm gonna take it.

52:45.747 --> 52:48.917
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

52:49.084 --> 52:52.212
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

52:52.379 --> 52:55.382
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

52:55.548 --> 52:56.841
All I need is a crew.

52:57.884 --> 52:59.552
From what I hear tell
of Captain Barbossa,

52:59.719 --> 53:02.931
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

53:03.098 --> 53:04.974
Then I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool.

53:05.141 --> 53:06.601
Prove me wrong.

53:06.768 --> 53:10.188
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

53:10.355 --> 53:14.317
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

53:29.916 --> 53:31.668
The kid?

53:32.419 --> 53:36.172
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

53:36.589 --> 53:38.967
His only child. Savvy?

53:39.426 --> 53:40.927
Is he, now?

53:44.264 --> 53:49.227
Leverage, says you.
I think I feel a change in the wind, says I.

53:49.394 --> 53:50.937
I'll find us a crew.

53:51.104 --> 53:53.732
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock crazy as you.

53:54.190 --> 53:57.193
One can only hope. Take what you can.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.945
Give nothing back.

54:23.845 --> 54:25.597
You'll be dining with the captain.

54:26.055 --> 54:28.057
And he requests you wear this.

54:28.933 --> 54:31.060
Well, you may tell the captain
that I am disinclined

54:31.227 --> 54:32.604
to acquiesce to his request.

54:33.772 --> 54:35.899
He said you'd say that.

54:36.065 --> 54:40.487
He also said, if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

54:40.653 --> 54:42.238
And you'll be naked.

54:48.703 --> 54:49.746
Fine.

55:06.429 --> 55:09.974
There is no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

55:11.142 --> 55:12.393
You must be hungry.

55:29.911 --> 55:31.871
Try the wine.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.211
And the apples. One of those next.

55:47.303 --> 55:48.847
It's poisoned.

55:50.431 --> 55:52.684
There would be no sense
to be killing you, Miss Turner.

55:52.851 --> 55:56.229
Then release me. You have your trinket,
I'm of no further value to you.

56:00.316 --> 56:05.488
- You don't know what this is, do you?
- It's a pirate medallion.

56:05.655 --> 56:09.033
This is Aztec gold.

56:09.200 --> 56:13.246
One of 882 identical pieces
they delivered in a stone chest

56:13.413 --> 56:16.332
to Cortés himself.

56:16.583 --> 56:21.421
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

56:21.588 --> 56:24.716
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

56:24.883 --> 56:29.470
And so the heathen gods
placed upon the gold

56:30.138 --> 56:31.723
a terrible curse.

56:33.474 --> 56:38.479
Any mortal that removes
but a single piece from that stone chest

56:38.646 --> 56:42.233
shall be punished for eternity.

56:43.902 --> 56:46.821
I hardly believe in ghost stories any more,
Captain Barbossa.

56:46.988 --> 56:48.740
Aye.

56:49.032 --> 56:52.535
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

56:52.702 --> 56:55.288
Buried on an Island of the Dead
what cannot be found

56:55.455 --> 56:57.332
except for those who know where it is.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.336
Find it, We did.

57:02.045 --> 57:08.635
There be the chest. Inside be the gold.
And we took them all.

57:09.177 --> 57:10.762
We spent them and traded them

57:10.929 --> 57:15.224
and frittered them away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

57:15.391 --> 57:21.230
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realise

57:21.564 --> 57:28.363
the drink would not satisfy,
food turned to ash in our mouths,

57:28.529 --> 57:33.826
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

57:35.036 --> 57:38.665
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

57:39.290 --> 57:45.338
Compelled by greed we were,
but now we are consumed by it.

57:56.975 --> 57:59.435
There is one way
we can end our curse.

58:03.481 --> 58:10.446
All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold
must be restored and the blood repaid.

58:13.241 --> 58:14.617
Thanks to you

58:15.243 --> 58:17.578
we have the final piece.

58:18.830 --> 58:21.124
And the blood to be repaid?

58:21.624 --> 58:25.503
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you yet.

58:28.006 --> 58:29.048
Apple?

58:38.141 --> 58:39.726
No!

58:46.065 --> 58:49.902
I'm curious. After killing me,
what is it you're planning on doing next?

59:19.307 --> 59:20.600
Oh, no.

59:54.509 --> 59:59.263
Look. The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

59:59.430 --> 01:00:02.517
We are not among the living,
and so we cannot die.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.894
But neither are we dead.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.398
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:13.694
Too long I've been starving to death
and haven't died.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.781
I feel nothing.

01:00:16.948 --> 01:00:20.827
Not the wind on my face
nor the spray of the sea.

01:00:21.369 --> 01:00:24.372
Nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

01:00:25.206 --> 01:00:28.793
You'd best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.002
You're in one.

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:51.023
What are you looking at? Back to work.

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:53.276
You heard the captain. Back to work.

01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:04.829
Feast your eyes, captain.
All of them faithful hands before the mast.

01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:10.293
Every man worth his salt.
And crazy, to boot.

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:14.380
So this is your able-bodied crew?

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.512
- You, sailor.
- Cotton, sir.

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:25.308
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:28.352
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:31.689
Mr. Cotton. Answer, man.

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:34.901
He's a mute, sir.
Poor devil had his tongue cutout.

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:39.238
So he trained the parrot to talk for him.
No one's yet figured how.

01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:44.535
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:46.037
Same question.

01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:49.874
Wind in your sails. Wind in your sails.

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:55.546
- Mostly we figure that means, "Yes."
- Of course it does. Satisfied?

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:57.757
Well, you've proved they're mad.

01:01:57.924 --> 01:01:59.592
And what's the benefit for us?

01:02:10.186 --> 01:02:12.188
Anamaria.

01:02:13.648 --> 01:02:15.483
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one either.

01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:19.237
- No, that one I deserved.
- You stole my boat.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:21.405
Actually--

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:25.409
Borrowed.
Borrowed without permission.

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:27.954
But with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.540
- But you didn't.
- You'll get another one.

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:34.335
- I will.
- A better one.

01:02:34.502 --> 01:02:36.254
A better one.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.005
- That one.
- What one?

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.468
That one?

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:47.974
Aye. That one. What say you?

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.184
- Aye!
- Aye!

01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:52.103
Anchor's aweigh.

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:56.440
No, no, no. It's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:59.235
It'll be far worse not to have her.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:35.938
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:40.151
- with a compass that doesn't work?
- Aye, the compass doesn't point north.

01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:43.070
But we're not trying to find north,
are we?

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:56.125
We should drop canvas, sir.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.294
She can hold a bit longer.

01:04:00.588 --> 01:04:03.257
What in your head has put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

01:04:04.133 --> 01:04:06.010
We're catching up.

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:23.110
Time to go, poppet-

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:23.045
Dead men tell no tales.

01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:26.924
Puts a chill in the bones,

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:30.177
how many honest sailors
have been claimed by this passage.

01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:47.903
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.990
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he showed up in Tortuga

01:05:51.157 --> 01:05:54.034
with a mind to go after the treasure
of the lsla de Muerta.

01:05:54.201 --> 01:05:55.369
That was before I'd met him,

01:05:55.536 --> 01:05:57.580
back when he was captain
of the <i>Black</i> Pearl.

01:05:58.456 --> 01:05:59.498
What?

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:04.753
He failed to mention that.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.881
Well, he plays things
close to the vest now.

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:10.634
And a hard-learned lesson it was.
Three days out on the venture,

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:13.679
the first mate comes to him
and says everything's an equal share,

01:06:13.846 --> 01:06:15.848
that should mean the location
of the treasure too.

01:06:16.015 --> 01:06:21.103
So Jack gives up the bearings.
That night there was a mutiny.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.107
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

01:06:25.274 --> 01:06:27.526
But not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:34.033
So that's the reason for all the:

01:06:36.285 --> 01:06:37.786
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.789
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:43.959
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot.

01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:47.129
Well, that won't do much good hunting
or to be rescued.

01:06:47.296 --> 01:06:50.758
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

01:06:50.925 --> 01:06:54.053
that pistol starts to look real friendly.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.598
But Jack, he escaped the island,
and he still has that single shot.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:07:03.312
Oh, he won't use it, though,
save on one man. His mutinous first mate.

01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:05.981
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:09.860
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell you.

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:11.529
He waded out into the shallows

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.365
and he waited there three days
and three nights

01:07:14.532 --> 01:07:18.285
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.829
Then on the fourth morning

01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:25.584
he roped himself a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:32.216
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye, sea turtles.

01:07:33.509 --> 01:07:34.552
What did he use for rope?

01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:45.187
Human hair. From my back.

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:49.316
- Let go the anchor.
- Lower the anchor line!

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.819
Young Mr. Turner and I
are to go ashore.

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:56.031
Captain,
what if the worst should happen?

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:59.910
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye, the Code.

01:08:24.643 --> 01:08:25.685
Move.

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:31.317
Ten years of hoarding swag
and now we finally get to spend it.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:40.451
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.872
And you can buy an eye
what actually fits and is made of glass.

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:47.916
This one does splinter
something terrible.

01:08:48.876 --> 01:08:50.169
Stop rubbing it.

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:12.858
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:16.694
Pirates' Code.
Any man who falls behind

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:20.157
is left behind.

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:23.368
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:26.497
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates

01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:29.457
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.381
Sprung a man from jail,
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:38.676
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:43.346
And you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.728
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.

01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:59.697
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:05.661
Gentlemen, the time has come.
Our salvation is nigh.

01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:10.624
- Our torment is near an end.
- Elizabeth.

01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:12.835
For ten years
we've been tested and tried,

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:14.795
and each man-jack of you here

01:10:14.962 --> 01:10:18.173
has proved his mettle
a hundred times over.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.552
And a hundred times again.

01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:23.971
Suffered I have.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:31.603
Punished we were, the lot of us.
Disproportionate to our crime.

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:34.773
Here it is.

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.072
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

01:10:43.866 --> 01:10:48.412
Every last piece that went astray
we have returned.

01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:50.164
Save for this.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.624
- Jack.
- Not yet.

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:56.128
We wait for the opportune moment.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:59.757
Saving what we found,
despairing of ever finding the last.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:04.344
When's that?
When it's of greatest profit to you?

01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:06.847
May I ask you something?

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:10.642
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:16.106
Do us a favour. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:19.610
And try not to do anything stupid.

01:11:21.904 --> 01:11:24.198
And who among us has paid
the blood sacrifice

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:26.658
owed to the heathen gods?

01:11:27.201 --> 01:11:30.329
- And whose blood must yet be paid?
- Hers!

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:38.045
You know the first thing I'm gonna do
after the curse is lifted?

01:11:40.422 --> 01:11:42.841
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.646
Begun by blood. By blood undone.

01:12:00.192 --> 01:12:03.779
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not gonna be your leverage.

01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:14.998
That's it?

01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:16.917
Waste not.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.206
Did it work?

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.167
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:07.759
You're not dead.

01:13:09.136 --> 01:13:10.470
No.

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.308
- You shot me.
- It didn't work.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.310
The curse is still upon us.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:23.901
You. Maid. Your father.
What was his name?

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.236
Was your father William Turner?

01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:29.281
- No.
- Where's his child?

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:31.533
The child that sailed
from England eight years ago.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.328
The child in whose veins
flows the blood of William Turner?

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:36.204
Where?

01:13:42.544 --> 01:13:46.548
You two.
You brought us the wrong person.

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:51.970
No. She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:54.932
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.769
I think she lied to us.

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:02.814
You brought us here for nothing?

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.233
I won't take questioning
or second guesses,

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.069
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:08.320
Who's to blame him?

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:11.323
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse.

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:16.119
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths.

01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:22.542
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place.

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:27.005
If any coward here
dare challenge me, let him speak.

01:14:29.257 --> 01:14:33.971
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood, just in case.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.555
Yeah.

01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:47.275
The medallion! She's taken it!

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:51.279
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates.

01:14:55.367 --> 01:14:58.203
- There's no oars here.
- Where's the oars?

01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:01.081
- They stole the oars.
- The oars have gone missing.

01:15:01.915 --> 01:15:03.834
Find them.

01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:08.630
Find the oars.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:13.593
You.

01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:16.555
You're supposed to be dead.

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:18.974
Am I not?

01:15:28.025 --> 01:15:29.818
Pearlie.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:33.030
Pa-la-la-leh-loo-loo.

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:40.871
Parlinny. Parsnip. Parsley. Par--

01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:43.248
- Par-- No, partner.
- Parley?

01:15:43.415 --> 01:15:45.167
That's the one. Parley.

01:15:45.834 --> 01:15:49.337
- Parley.
- Parley?

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:53.592
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley.

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.137
That would be the French.

01:16:08.982 --> 01:16:12.694
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

01:16:13.445 --> 01:16:14.488
Mr. Gibbs?

01:16:15.197 --> 01:16:16.490
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:21.078
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

01:16:21.787 --> 01:16:22.871
Fell behind.

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:31.963
Keep to the Code.

01:16:33.465 --> 01:16:34.633
Weigh anchor.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.512
Hoist the sails.
Split-quick, you dibbies.

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:47.020
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:51.775
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

01:16:51.942 --> 01:16:54.319
you forgot one very important thing,
mate.

01:16:56.196 --> 01:16:58.323
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:03.245
Well, I won't be making that mistake
again.

01:17:03.995 --> 01:17:06.873
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.376
- Yeah.
- Aye.

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:10.585
Kill him.

01:17:12.212 --> 01:17:15.257
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:19.052
Hold your fire.

01:17:24.975 --> 01:17:27.394
You know whose blood we need.

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:30.939
I know whose blood you need.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:40.907
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

01:17:41.074 --> 01:17:42.784
Pirate.

01:17:43.201 --> 01:17:48.331
- Here. Let me.
- Thank you.

01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:52.961
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

01:17:54.004 --> 01:17:55.547
Why?

01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.342
I don't know.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:04.139
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

01:18:04.306 --> 01:18:07.559
No. I mean, yes, they are but--

01:18:11.479 --> 01:18:13.440
But don't stop.

01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:22.908
Elizabeth.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.467
It's yours.

01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:46.056
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

01:18:47.641 --> 01:18:48.934
It was a gift from my father.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.102
He sent it to me.

01:18:57.067 --> 01:18:58.318
Why did you take it?

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:03.198
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

01:19:04.783 --> 01:19:07.118
That would have been awful.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.831
It wasn't your blood they needed.

01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:17.921
It was my father's blood.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:21.299
My blood.

01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:30.433
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:45.865
So you expect to leave me standing
on some beach

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:49.035
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

01:19:49.202 --> 01:19:52.872
and watch you sail away in my ship?

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:56.543
No. I expect to leave you
standing on some beach

01:19:56.710 --> 01:20:00.880
with absolutely no name at all,
watching me sail away on my ship,

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:04.801
and then I'll shout the name
back to you. Savvy?

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:07.637
But that leaves us with the problem
of me standing on some beach

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:11.808
with nought but a name
and your word it's the one I need.

01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:18.106
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

01:20:18.273 --> 01:20:22.152
Therefore,
my word is the one we'll be trusting.

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:25.363
Although, I suppose
I should be thanking you,

01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:29.034
because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die

01:20:30.035 --> 01:20:33.997
I would have an equal share in that curse,
same as you.

01:20:34.706 --> 01:20:35.790
Funny old world, isn't it?

01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:42.297
Captain, we're coming up
on the Interceptor.

01:20:55.477 --> 01:20:57.479
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

01:20:58.229 --> 01:21:01.900
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

01:21:02.067 --> 01:21:06.112
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion? What say you to that?

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:07.447
Now, you see, Jack,

01:21:07.614 --> 01:21:09.824
that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.786
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:16.039
Lock him in the brig.

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:29.886
Hands aloft to loose the gallants!

01:21:30.053 --> 01:21:33.181
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:37.018
- What's happening?
- The <i>Black</i> Pearl. She's gaining on us.

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.733
But this is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.819
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

01:21:47.237 --> 01:21:49.697
- We're shallower on the draught, right?
- Aye.

01:21:49.864 --> 01:21:51.991
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:56.454
We don't have to outrun them long.
Just long enough.

01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:59.124
Lighten the ship. Stem to stern.

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:02.210
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost.

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:14.264
Apparently, there's a leak.

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:32.240
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

01:22:32.407 --> 01:22:34.909
Run out the sweeps.

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:37.245
Heave, ho!

01:23:02.061 --> 01:23:04.189
We're gonna need that.

01:23:12.322 --> 01:23:18.453
- It was a good plan up till now.
- Gibbs, we have to make a stand.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.664
We must fight. Load the guns.

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:24.918
- With what?
- Anything. Everything.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.252
Anything we have left.

01:23:28.505 --> 01:23:30.298
Load the guns!

01:23:30.465 --> 01:23:33.718
Case shot and langrage.
Nails and crushed glass.

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:37.472
With a Will!

01:23:59.202 --> 01:24:01.371
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter.

01:24:01.538 --> 01:24:04.249
She'll rake us
without ever presenting a target.

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:06.376
Lower the anchor on the right side.

01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:10.964
- On the starboard side.
- It certainly has the element of surprise.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:15.051
- You're daft, lady. You both are.
- Daft like Jack.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.928
Lower the starboard anchor!

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:20.848
Do it, you gobs,
or it's you we'll load into the cannons.

01:24:21.015 --> 01:24:23.101
Starboard anchor, lower away.

01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:41.160
Let go!

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:52.297
They're club hauling.
Hard a port. Rack the starboard oars.

01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:54.591
- Hard a port.
- Starboard oars.

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:07.895
Keep her steady, man.

01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:15.945
- Now!
- Fire!

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:17.196
Fire all!

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:29.000
Stop blowing holes in my ship.

01:26:02.784 --> 01:26:05.244
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:26:15.588 --> 01:26:19.384
- We could use a few more ideas, lass.
- Your turn.

01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:22.595
- We need us a devil's dowry.
- We'll give them her.

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:25.098
She's not what they're after.

01:26:27.684 --> 01:26:29.018
The medallion.

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:53.710
Strike your colours,
you blooming cockroaches.

01:26:54.168 --> 01:26:58.923
Hands, grapnels at the ready.
Prepare to board.

01:27:32.832 --> 01:27:35.585
Pistols and cutlasses, men.

01:27:35.752 --> 01:27:37.378
Koehler, Twigg.
To the powder magazine!

01:27:37.837 --> 01:27:41.257
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:53.936
Hey! Hey!

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:11.746
Hey! Below!

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:33.017
Thanks very much.

01:28:46.531 --> 01:28:48.282
Jack!

01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:50.535
Bloody empty-

01:29:06.676 --> 01:29:07.760
That's not very nice.

01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:15.309
- Where's the medallion?
- Wretch!

01:29:18.688 --> 01:29:19.730
Where is dear William?

01:29:21.941 --> 01:29:23.150
Will.

01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:27.613
- Will.
- Elizabeth.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.660
Monkey.

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:40.209
I can't move it.

01:29:40.376 --> 01:29:42.545
- Come on, you.
- No! Will!

01:29:42.712 --> 01:29:46.173
- Elizabeth!
- Will!

01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:58.144
Why, thank you, Jack.

01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:02.481
- You're welcome.
- Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

01:30:03.774 --> 01:30:06.652
Gents, our hope is restored.

01:30:43.356 --> 01:30:46.651
If any of you so much as thinks
the word parley,

01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:49.487
I'll have your guts for garters.

01:30:57.411 --> 01:30:59.246
Will.

01:30:59.413 --> 01:31:03.709
- You godless savage!
- Welcome back, miss.

01:31:03.876 --> 01:31:06.504
You took advantage
of our hospitality last time.

01:31:06.671 --> 01:31:10.257
It holds fair now you return the favour.

01:31:15.846 --> 01:31:16.931
Barbossa.

01:31:19.058 --> 01:31:20.768
Will.

01:31:22.853 --> 01:31:26.524
- She goes free.
- What's in your head, boy?

01:31:28.025 --> 01:31:29.193
She goes free.

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.446
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

01:31:33.698 --> 01:31:34.991
Don't do anything stupid.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.203
You can't.

01:31:39.954 --> 01:31:41.706
I can.

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:44.041
Like that.

01:31:45.126 --> 01:31:46.377
Who are you?

01:31:47.128 --> 01:31:48.754
No one. He's no one.

01:31:48.921 --> 01:31:51.966
A distant cousin
of my aunt's nephew twice removed.

01:31:52.133 --> 01:31:54.218
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

01:31:54.385 --> 01:31:58.723
My name is Will Turner.
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:01.392
His blood runs in my veins.

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:03.728
He's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill,

01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:05.646
come back to haunt us.

01:32:05.813 --> 01:32:07.690
On my word, do as I say

01:32:08.357 --> 01:32:11.902
or I'll pull this trigger
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker.

01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:15.239
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

01:32:15.406 --> 01:32:19.201
- Elizabeth goes free.
- Yes, we know that one. Anything else?

01:32:22.663 --> 01:32:26.167
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.

01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:31.714
Agreed.

01:32:38.095 --> 01:32:41.348
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

01:32:41.515 --> 01:32:44.810
Go. Go on, then.

01:32:51.067 --> 01:32:52.610
Barbossa, you lying bastard.

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:56.947
- You swore she'd go free.
- Don't dare impugn me honour, boy.

01:32:58.324 --> 01:32:59.366
I agreed she'd go free,

01:32:59.533 --> 01:33:02.495
but it was you who failed to specify
when or where.

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:13.172
Though it does seem a shame
to lose something so fine, don't it, lads?

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:17.384
So I'll be having that dress back
before you go.

01:33:21.722 --> 01:33:23.849
I always liked you.

01:33:27.019 --> 01:33:29.188
It goes with your black heart.

01:33:30.606 --> 01:33:31.899
It's still warm.

01:33:35.319 --> 01:33:37.321
Off you go.

01:33:37.863 --> 01:33:39.240
Come on.

01:33:42.868 --> 01:33:43.911
Too long.

01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:58.217
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

01:33:58.801 --> 01:34:02.263
Jack. Jack.

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:04.515
Did you not notice?

01:34:04.932 --> 01:34:07.351
That be the same little island
that we made you governor of

01:34:07.518 --> 01:34:09.979
on our last little trip.

01:34:10.646 --> 01:34:11.814
I did notice.

01:34:11.981 --> 01:34:16.152
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:18.404
But I doubt it.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:22.116
Off you go.

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:25.744
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

01:34:26.162 --> 01:34:29.582
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:31.959
Bring it forward.

01:34:34.587 --> 01:34:39.300
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

01:34:39.466 --> 01:34:42.553
It'll be one pistol as before,
and you can be the gentleman

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.890
and shoot the lady
and starve to death yourself.

01:35:10.331 --> 01:35:13.834
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:18.881
But you were marooned
on this island before, weren't you?

01:35:19.048 --> 01:35:20.549
We can escape the same way you did.

01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:23.552
To what point and purpose,
young missy?

01:35:23.719 --> 01:35:25.554
<i>The Black Pearl is</i> gone.

01:35:25.721 --> 01:35:29.308
And unless you have a rudder
and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice--

01:35:29.475 --> 01:35:31.310
Unlikely.

01:35:31.477 --> 01:35:34.230
--Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:39.276
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:43.739
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

01:35:43.906 --> 01:35:46.533
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:50.037
Are you the pirate I've read about
or not?

01:35:51.497 --> 01:35:53.332
How did you escape last time?

01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:04.468
Last time I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:07.763
Last time

01:36:08.806 --> 01:36:12.434
the rumrunners who used this island
as a cache came by,

01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:14.937
and I was able to barter passage off.

01:36:15.104 --> 01:36:17.690
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

01:36:18.607 --> 01:36:23.612
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:26.115
So that's it, then?

01:36:26.532 --> 01:36:31.245
That's the secret grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

01:36:31.412 --> 01:36:35.541
You spent three days lying on a beach
drinking rum.

01:36:38.585 --> 01:36:41.297
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:52.891
<i>We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs</i>

01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:55.811
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

01:36:55.978 --> 01:36:57.938
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

01:36:58.105 --> 01:36:59.690
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

01:36:59.857 --> 01:37:01.734
I love this song.

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:08.032
Really bad egg.

01:37:11.869 --> 01:37:13.662
When I get the <i>Pearl</i> back

01:37:13.829 --> 01:37:17.750
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew
and we'll sing it all the time.

01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:21.837
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main.

01:37:22.004 --> 01:37:26.467
Not just the Spanish Main, love
The entire ocean.

01:37:26.633 --> 01:37:28.302
The entire world.

01:37:29.386 --> 01:37:32.848
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is, you know.

01:37:33.015 --> 01:37:35.726
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

01:37:35.893 --> 01:37:37.311
That's what a ship needs.

01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:40.272
But what a ship is--

01:37:40.856 --> 01:37:44.777
<i>What the Black Pearl really is</i>

01:37:45.361 --> 01:37:47.404
is freedom.

01:37:49.448 --> 01:37:50.532
Jack.

01:37:51.867 --> 01:37:55.996
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

01:37:56.163 --> 01:37:57.331
Oh, yes.

01:37:57.915 --> 01:38:03.420
But the company is infinitely better
than last time,

01:38:04.922 --> 01:38:07.049
and the scenery
has definitely improved.

01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:11.220
Mr. Sparrow, I'm not entirely sure
that I've had enough rum

01:38:11.387 --> 01:38:12.679
to allow that kind of talk.

01:38:14.473 --> 01:38:17.393
I know exactly what you mean, love.

01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:25.192
To freedom.

01:38:28.028 --> 01:38:30.197
<i>To the Black Pearl.</i>

01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:04.231
No. Not good. Stop. Not good.

01:39:04.398 --> 01:39:05.441
What are you doing?

01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:08.235
You burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

01:39:08.402 --> 01:39:11.071
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

01:39:11.738 --> 01:39:13.449
One, because it is a vile drink

01:39:13.615 --> 01:39:16.368
that turns even the most respectable men
into complete scoundrels.

01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:19.663
Two, that signal
is over a thousand feet high.

01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:21.748
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

01:39:21.915 --> 01:39:24.334
Do you really think that there
is even the slightest chance

01:39:24.501 --> 01:39:27.463
- that they won't see it?
- But why is the rum gone?

01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:29.965
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

01:39:30.591 --> 01:39:32.926
You give it one hour, maybe two,
keep a weather eye open,

01:39:33.093 --> 01:39:36.346
and you will see white sails
on that horizon.

01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:45.314
"It must have been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack.

01:39:45.481 --> 01:39:49.359
Must have been terrible for you--"
Well, it bloody is now!

01:39:56.116 --> 01:39:58.952
There'll be no living with her after this.

01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:01.079
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

01:40:01.538 --> 01:40:02.915
You're safe now.

01:40:03.081 --> 01:40:06.752
We will return to Port Royal immediately,
not go gallivanting after pirates.

01:40:06.919 --> 01:40:08.128
Then we condemn him to death.

01:40:10.088 --> 01:40:11.673
The boy's fate is regrettable.

01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:15.427
But then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

01:40:15.594 --> 01:40:18.722
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

01:40:19.389 --> 01:40:23.018
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

01:40:23.185 --> 01:40:25.854
the <i>Pearl</i> was listing near to scuppers
after the battle.

01:40:26.021 --> 01:40:28.857
It's very unlikely
she'll be able to make good time.

01:40:29.233 --> 01:40:32.778
<i>Think about it. The Black Pearl.</i>

01:40:32.945 --> 01:40:37.241
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

01:40:37.407 --> 01:40:40.160
How can you pass that up, eh?

01:40:41.411 --> 01:40:45.624
By remembering that I serve others
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

01:40:45.791 --> 01:40:49.378
Commodore, I beg you, please do this.
For me.

01:40:49.545 --> 01:40:51.630
As a wedding gift.

01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:56.468
Elizabeth. Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

01:40:59.304 --> 01:41:00.430
I <i>am.</i>

01:41:01.014 --> 01:41:04.309
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around.

01:41:06.687 --> 01:41:09.356
I know. Clap him in irons, right?

01:41:11.984 --> 01:41:14.111
Mr. Sparrow,

01:41:14.486 --> 01:41:16.321
you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

01:41:16.488 --> 01:41:18.532
and provide us with a bearing
to lsla de Muerta.

01:41:19.658 --> 01:41:22.786
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

01:41:22.953 --> 01:41:27.416
of the phrase "silent as the grave."
Do I make myself clear?

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.669
Inescapably clear.

01:41:34.715 --> 01:41:38.218
- Shiver me timbers.
- Cotton here says you missed a bit.

01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:44.600
You knew William Turner?

01:41:46.518 --> 01:41:49.605
Old Bootstrap Bill. We knew him.

01:41:50.897 --> 01:41:54.860
Never sat well with Bootstrap
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

01:41:55.027 --> 01:41:57.279
The mutiny and all.

01:41:57.529 --> 01:41:59.364
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

01:42:00.574 --> 01:42:03.619
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you, as it were.

01:42:05.287 --> 01:42:08.498
He said we deserved to be cursed

01:42:08.999 --> 01:42:10.959
and remain cursed.

01:42:11.126 --> 01:42:13.962
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:15.839
But, as you can imagine,

01:42:16.882 --> 01:42:19.676
that didn't sit too well with the captain.

01:42:19.843 --> 01:42:22.763
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

01:42:22.929 --> 01:42:26.308
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story.

01:42:28.977 --> 01:42:32.939
So, what the captain did,

01:42:33.106 --> 01:42:35.484
he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

01:42:35.651 --> 01:42:40.280
- Bootstrap's bootstraps.
- The last we saw of old Bill Turner

01:42:40.447 --> 01:42:45.994
he was sinking to the crushing black
oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.

01:42:46.828 --> 01:42:48.246
Of course, it was only after that,

01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:51.416
we learned we needed his blood
to lift the curse.

01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:54.419
That's what you call ironic.

01:42:58.757 --> 01:43:00.467
Bring him.

01:43:06.973 --> 01:43:08.850
I don't care for the situation.

01:43:09.685 --> 01:43:12.479
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn to an ambush.

01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:15.899
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

01:43:16.066 --> 01:43:19.611
I go in and convince Barbossa
to send his men out with their little boats.

01:43:20.445 --> 01:43:22.489
You and your mates
return to the Dauntless

01:43:22.656 --> 01:43:25.826
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons, aye.

01:43:25.992 --> 01:43:31.873
- What do you have to lose?
- Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

01:43:32.457 --> 01:43:34.960
Now, to be quite honest with you,

01:43:35.127 --> 01:43:37.212
there's still a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

01:43:37.379 --> 01:43:40.549
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

01:43:40.799 --> 01:43:42.300
Sorry, but it's for your own safety.

01:43:42.467 --> 01:43:45.220
I don't care what the commodore ordered.
I have to tell him.

01:43:45.387 --> 01:43:48.432
The pirates.
They're cursed, they can't be killed.

01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:50.642
Don't worry, miss,
he's already informed of that.

01:43:50.809 --> 01:43:54.479
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

01:43:55.147 --> 01:43:58.150
This is Jack Sparrow's doing.

01:44:08.535 --> 01:44:12.831
No reason to fret. Just a prick
of the finger. A few drops of blood.

01:44:12.998 --> 01:44:19.087
No mistakes this time.
He's only half Turner. We spill it all.

01:44:20.505 --> 01:44:23.049
Guess there is reason to fret.

01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:38.231
Beg your pardon, beg your pardon.

01:44:38.398 --> 01:44:40.108
- Begun by blood.
- Excuse me.

01:44:40.275 --> 01:44:42.944
By blood and--

01:44:45.697 --> 01:44:47.240
Jack.

01:44:47.407 --> 01:44:50.619
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

01:44:51.369 --> 01:44:52.454
Where's Elizabeth?

01:44:53.872 --> 01:44:56.416
She's safe, just like I promised.

01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:59.085
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised.

01:44:59.419 --> 01:45:01.505
And you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

01:45:02.047 --> 01:45:04.299
So we're all men of our word, really.

01:45:04.466 --> 01:45:07.093
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:09.596
Shut up. You're next.

01:45:12.224 --> 01:45:17.896
- You don't want to be doing that, mate.
- No, I really think I do.

01:45:18.772 --> 01:45:20.649
Your funeral.

01:45:24.027 --> 01:45:25.779
Why don't I want to be doing it?

01:45:26.488 --> 01:45:28.448
Well, because--

01:45:28.615 --> 01:45:33.411
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

01:45:33.578 --> 01:45:38.625
is floating just offshore, waiting for you.

01:45:46.758 --> 01:45:48.677
What we doing here?

01:45:49.803 --> 01:45:53.765
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

01:45:53.932 --> 01:45:59.104
We catch them in a crossfire,
send them down to see Old Hob.

01:45:59.437 --> 01:46:00.981
I know why we're here.

01:46:01.147 --> 01:46:06.152
I meant, why aren't we doing what it was
what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

01:46:06.319 --> 01:46:10.949
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

01:46:13.326 --> 01:46:15.620
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

01:46:15.787 --> 01:46:18.540
Just hear me out, mate.

01:46:18.707 --> 01:46:21.334
Order your men to the Dauntless.
They do what they do best.

01:46:22.502 --> 01:46:27.090
Robert's your uncle, Fannie's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

01:46:27.257 --> 01:46:29.426
The makings of your very own fleet.

01:46:29.926 --> 01:46:33.096
Of course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

01:46:33.263 --> 01:46:35.599
<i>But what of the Pearl?</i>

01:46:36.433 --> 01:46:38.059
Name me captain.

01:46:38.226 --> 01:46:41.229
I'll sail under your colours,
I'll give you 10 percent of me plunder,

01:46:41.396 --> 01:46:46.902
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa.

01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:49.779
- Savvy?
- I suppose in exchange,

01:46:49.946 --> 01:46:53.033
- you want me not to kill the whelp.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

01:46:53.199 --> 01:46:54.743
By all means, kill the whelp.

01:46:55.118 --> 01:47:02.125
Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

01:47:05.712 --> 01:47:07.589
For instance,

01:47:09.049 --> 01:47:12.010
after you've killed Norrington's men.

01:47:12.802 --> 01:47:17.265
Every last one.

01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:29.402
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

01:47:29.569 --> 01:47:32.697
- Ever since you learned my name.
- Yeah.

01:47:35.116 --> 01:47:36.826
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

01:47:36.993 --> 01:47:38.244
- Fifteen.
- Forty.

01:47:38.411 --> 01:47:40.246
Twenty-five.

01:47:40.538 --> 01:47:41.748
I'll buy you the hat.

01:47:42.332 --> 01:47:43.833
A really big one,

01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:45.752
commodore.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.299
We have an accord.

01:47:52.175 --> 01:47:54.094
All hands to the boats.

01:47:55.178 --> 01:47:57.973
Apologies. You give the orders.

01:47:59.474 --> 01:48:01.226
Gents,

01:48:01.518 --> 01:48:03.311
take a walk.

01:48:08.024 --> 01:48:09.067
Not to the boats?

01:49:08.501 --> 01:49:10.462
Hold fire.

01:49:13.214 --> 01:49:16.968
Oh, this is just like what the Greeks done
at Troy.

01:49:17.427 --> 01:49:20.513
Except they was in a horse
instead of dresses.

01:49:21.264 --> 01:49:22.599
Wooden horse.

01:49:35.695 --> 01:49:37.614
A moment, please.

01:49:40.825 --> 01:49:42.452
Elizabeth.

01:49:45.246 --> 01:49:46.790
I just want you to know, I--

01:49:47.999 --> 01:49:51.169
I believe you made
a very good decision today.

01:49:51.336 --> 01:49:53.713
Couldn't be more proud of you.

01:49:54.089 --> 01:49:57.801
But you know, even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

01:49:57.967 --> 01:49:59.469
can be a wrong decision.

01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:10.271
- Look into that, will you? Report back.
- Lieutenant?

01:50:28.748 --> 01:50:30.708
Elizabeth.

01:50:32.085 --> 01:50:33.878
Are you there?

01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:38.091
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

01:51:04.576 --> 01:51:07.287
Oh, what have you done?

01:51:08.246 --> 01:51:10.915
Stop that. Already feel like a fool.

01:51:12.125 --> 01:51:14.169
Look nice, though.

01:51:17.881 --> 01:51:19.215
I look nice?

01:51:56.169 --> 01:51:59.464
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had you figured.

01:51:59.631 --> 01:52:02.634
But it turns out
you're a hard man to predict.

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.719
Me? I'm dishonest.

01:52:04.886 --> 01:52:07.931
And a dishonest man
you can always trust to be dishonest.

01:52:08.097 --> 01:52:11.684
Honestly. It's the honest ones
you want to watch out for,

01:52:12.143 --> 01:52:14.103
because you can never predict

01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:18.316
when they're gonna do something
incredibly stupid.

01:52:51.766 --> 01:52:55.937
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters.

01:53:00.817 --> 01:53:02.652
Right.

01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:07.824
- What would you pick to eat first?
- I think we should decide now.

01:53:07.991 --> 01:53:10.076
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

01:53:35.518 --> 01:53:37.353
What was that?

01:53:59.375 --> 01:54:01.127
Miss Elizabeth.

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:22.523
Make for the ship. Move.

01:54:32.075 --> 01:54:33.785
To the ship!

01:54:36.662 --> 01:54:38.539
Row, men.

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.912
You can't beat me, Jack.

01:55:42.353 --> 01:55:43.688
That's interesting.

01:55:54.699 --> 01:55:56.492
I couldn't resist, mate.

01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:04.060
Sorry.

01:57:13.236 --> 01:57:14.654
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:17.448
Are we to be two immortals
locked in an epic battle

01:57:17.615 --> 01:57:21.035
until judgment day
and the trumpets sound?

01:57:21.202 --> 01:57:23.204
Or you could surrender.

01:57:49.730 --> 01:57:52.984
All of you with me.
Will is in that cave and we must save him.

01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:56.862
Ready. And heave.

01:58:02.535 --> 01:58:04.453
Please, I need your help. Come on.

01:58:05.371 --> 01:58:09.000
- Any port in a storm.
- Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

01:58:09.917 --> 01:58:11.752
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

01:58:11.919 --> 01:58:15.256
- Jack owes us a ship.
- And there's the Code to consider.

01:58:15.923 --> 01:58:17.675
The Code?

01:58:19.302 --> 01:58:22.888
You're pirates.
Hang the Code and hang the rules.

01:58:23.347 --> 01:58:25.391
They're more like guidelines anyway.

01:58:29.312 --> 01:58:31.355
Bloody pirates.

01:58:41.991 --> 01:58:44.910
- What?
- Is it supposed to be doing that?

01:58:45.077 --> 01:58:49.373
- They're stealing our ship.
- Bloody pirates.

01:58:51.917 --> 01:58:53.252
Boarders away.

01:59:01.636 --> 01:59:04.555
Come on!

01:59:30.039 --> 01:59:31.499
Me eye.

01:59:50.768 --> 01:59:54.438
- I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain.
- Do you like pain?

01:59:56.232 --> 01:59:57.608
Try wearing a corset.

02:00:08.285 --> 02:00:12.373
- Whose side is Jack on?
- At the moment?

02:00:47.908 --> 02:00:49.744
No fair.

02:01:12.808 --> 02:01:17.938
Ten years you carry that pistol,
and now you waste your shot.

02:01:18.230 --> 02:01:20.441
He didn't waste it.

02:01:45.925 --> 02:01:47.843
I feel...

02:01:51.931 --> 02:01:53.766
...cold.

02:02:55.411 --> 02:02:57.371
Parley?

02:02:58.247 --> 02:03:00.332
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

02:03:48.297 --> 02:03:50.382
We should return to the Dauntless.

02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:56.430
Your fiancé will be wanting to know
you're safe.

02:04:06.273 --> 02:04:09.735
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

02:04:10.527 --> 02:04:12.404
...that was it.

02:04:13.489 --> 02:04:14.615
Now, if you'd be so kind,

02:04:14.782 --> 02:04:18.285
I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

02:04:23.082 --> 02:04:25.167
I'm sorry, Jack.

02:04:27.294 --> 02:04:31.173
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:49.775
"Jack Sparrow, be it known
that you have been charged..."

02:04:49.942 --> 02:04:52.277
Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:04:52.987 --> 02:04:56.240
"...For your wilful commission
of crimes against the Crown.

02:04:57.491 --> 02:05:02.496
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

02:05:02.663 --> 02:05:06.166
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith.

02:05:06.333 --> 02:05:09.878
- Piracy, smuggling..."
- This is wrong.

02:05:11.422 --> 02:05:13.924
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law.

02:05:14.091 --> 02:05:16.510
As are we all.

02:05:16.677 --> 02:05:19.263
"...Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy.

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:22.433
Impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England..."

02:05:22.599 --> 02:05:25.811
- Oh, yeah.
- "...sailing under false colours,

02:05:25.978 --> 02:05:29.982
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

02:05:30.482 --> 02:05:37.823
brigandage, pilfering, depravity,
depredation, and general lawlessness.

02:05:39.366 --> 02:05:41.869
And for these crimes,
you have been sentenced to be,

02:05:42.036 --> 02:05:47.082
on this day,
hung by the neck until dead.

02:05:47.624 --> 02:05:49.918
May God have mercy on your soul."

02:05:50.085 --> 02:05:51.253
Governor Swann.

02:05:52.212 --> 02:05:53.255
Commodore.

02:05:55.090 --> 02:05:56.759
Elizabeth.

02:05:57.593 --> 02:06:00.012
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you.

02:06:03.307 --> 02:06:04.349
I love you.

02:06:19.531 --> 02:06:20.699
Watch yourself.

02:06:21.492 --> 02:06:23.452
- Marines.
- I can't breathe.

02:06:25.788 --> 02:06:27.539
Elizabeth.

02:06:29.458 --> 02:06:31.251
Move.

02:06:41.428 --> 02:06:43.514
- You men, quickly!
- What?

02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:56.401
Move.

02:07:05.828 --> 02:07:07.287
Come on.

02:07:15.796 --> 02:07:16.839
Come on!

02:07:17.005 --> 02:07:18.507
- Right, right.
- Come on, lads.

02:07:44.032 --> 02:07:45.367
I thought we might have to endure

02:07:45.534 --> 02:07:48.871
some manner
of ill-conceived escape attempt.

02:07:49.246 --> 02:07:50.581
But not from you.

02:07:50.747 --> 02:07:54.376
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

02:07:54.543 --> 02:07:58.297
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

02:07:59.173 --> 02:08:01.967
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

02:08:03.427 --> 02:08:05.429
If all I've achieved here
is the hangman will earn

02:08:05.596 --> 02:08:08.932
two pairs of boots
instead of one, so be it.

02:08:09.099 --> 02:08:13.854
- At least my conscience will be clear.
- You forget your place, Turner.

02:08:15.606 --> 02:08:18.483
It's right here, between you and Jack.

02:08:23.447 --> 02:08:25.657
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

02:08:27.201 --> 02:08:29.119
Lower your weapons.

02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:31.079
For goodness' sake, put them down.

02:08:36.376 --> 02:08:39.087
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then?

02:08:40.881 --> 02:08:42.257
It is.

02:08:51.099 --> 02:08:54.686
Well, I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

02:08:54.853 --> 02:08:57.189
I think we've all arrived
at a special place, eh?

02:08:57.356 --> 02:09:02.569
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

02:09:03.362 --> 02:09:06.907
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

02:09:07.241 --> 02:09:08.909
Know that.

02:09:12.454 --> 02:09:13.538
Elizabeth.

02:09:16.041 --> 02:09:18.085
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

02:09:20.254 --> 02:09:21.463
I'm sorry.

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:25.384
Will.

02:09:27.302 --> 02:09:28.512
Nice hat.

02:09:30.472 --> 02:09:32.057
Friends.

02:09:34.309 --> 02:09:39.439
This is a day that you will
always remember as the day that--

02:09:44.653 --> 02:09:47.072
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

02:09:49.616 --> 02:09:51.326
Sail ho!

02:09:59.001 --> 02:10:01.253
What's your plan of action?

02:10:02.337 --> 02:10:03.839
Sir?

02:10:07.843 --> 02:10:10.012
Perhaps on the rare occasion

02:10:10.178 --> 02:10:14.182
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

02:10:14.349 --> 02:10:18.603
piracy itself can be the right course?

02:10:22.357 --> 02:10:23.442
Mr. Turner.

02:10:29.698 --> 02:10:32.367
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

02:10:38.373 --> 02:10:40.959
This is a beautiful sword.

02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:45.964
I would expect the man who made it
to show the same care and devotion

02:10:46.131 --> 02:10:48.925
in every aspect of his life.

02:10:51.178 --> 02:10:52.804
Thank you.

02:10:55.682 --> 02:10:58.477
Commodore. What about Sparrow?

02:11:00.604 --> 02:11:04.524
Well, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

02:11:10.072 --> 02:11:11.615
So.

02:11:12.741 --> 02:11:15.702
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

02:11:17.245 --> 02:11:19.039
After all,

02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:20.957
he is a blacksmith.

02:11:22.167 --> 02:11:23.877
No.

02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.175
He's a pirate.

02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:57.411
Heave.

02:12:06.795 --> 02:12:09.047
Thought you were supposed to keep
to the Code.

02:12:09.756 --> 02:12:13.802
We figured
they were more actual guidelines.

02:12:18.056 --> 02:12:19.683
Thank you.

02:12:20.767 --> 02:12:23.103
Captain Sparrow.

02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:29.109
<i>The Black Pearl is</i> yours.

02:12:43.915 --> 02:12:47.335
On deck, you scabrous dogs.
Hands to braces.

02:12:47.502 --> 02:12:50.380
Let down and haul to run free.

02:12:51.381 --> 02:12:55.594
Now, bring me that horizon.

02:13:02.309 --> 02:13:05.145
And really bad eggs.

02:13:07.898 --> 02:13:09.983
Drink up, me hearties.
