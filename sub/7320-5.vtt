WEBVTT

00:12.167 --> 00:13.833
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.867 --> 00:17.300
I SLEPT WITH IZZIE.
GEORGE TOLD ME... EVERYTHING.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.333
YOU NAMED ME AVA,

00:19.367 --> 00:21.633
AND I WAS MORE ME AS AVA
THAN I'LL EVER BE AS REBECCA.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.533
DR. HAHN,
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED

00:23.567 --> 00:25.433
TO HEAR YOU WERE
JOINING US TODAY.

00:25.467 --> 00:29.100
YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS AN INTERN--

00:29.133 --> 00:31.100
FOCUSED, INTENSE, COLD.

00:31.133 --> 00:33.600
MY MOTHER'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE?
YES.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.833
LET'S DO THIS ONCE. I'M FINE.
SHE'S CREMATED.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.500
I PICKED OUT A BEAUTIFUL URN,

00:37.533 --> 00:39.800
AND SHE'S HANGING OUT
IN THE BACK OF MY CLOSET.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.333
ANY MORE QUESTIONS
ABOUT MY DEAD MOTHER,

00:41.367 --> 00:43.667
OR CAN WE GET BACK TO WORK?

00:43.700 --> 00:47.167
***

00:47.200 --> 00:50.700
PICK ME. CHOOSE ME.
LOVE ME.

00:50.733 --> 00:52.767
***

00:52.800 --> 00:54.800
YOU'RE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU.

00:54.833 --> 00:57.567
BUT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
LEAVING ME.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.367
IMAGINE MY DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN I WAKE UP AFTER FIVE YEARS

01:01.400 --> 01:04.400
AND DISCOVER THAT
YOU'RE NO MORE THAN ORDINARY.

01:04.433 --> 01:07.333
***

01:07.367 --> 01:08.833
(Meredith) THERE'S A REASON

01:08.867 --> 01:11.233
SURGEONS LEARN
TO WIELD SCALPELS.

01:11.267 --> 01:14.833
WE LIKE TO PRETEND
WE'RE HARD, COLD SCIENTISTS.

01:14.867 --> 01:18.333
WE LIKE TO PRETEND
WE'RE FEARLESS.

01:18.367 --> 01:23.700
PICK ME. CHOOSE ME.
LOVE ME.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.700
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WE BECOME SURGEONS

01:27.733 --> 01:29.367
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE, DEEP DOWN,

01:29.400 --> 01:33.333
WE THINK WE CAN CUT AWAY
THAT WHICH HAUNTS US...

01:35.467 --> 01:37.367
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING UP?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.300
COULDN'T SLEEP.
COULDN'T SLEEP.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.633
WEAKNESS, FRAILTY...

01:41.667 --> 01:44.167
DEATH.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.733
(Meredith closes cabinet)

01:52.833 --> 01:55.667
WHAT IS THAT?

01:55.700 --> 01:59.133
MY MOTHER.

01:59.167 --> 02:02.167
HAPPY FREAKIN' HALLOWEEN.

02:09.633 --> 02:12.533
YANG...

02:12.567 --> 02:14.467
YOU'RE MOVING OUT
OF BURKE'S PLACE, HUH?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.400
YES, SIR.

02:16.433 --> 02:19.233
MY WIFE HAS FILED
FOR DIVORCE.

02:19.267 --> 02:22.067
I'M VERY SORRY, SIR.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.833
AT ANY RATE,
I NEED A PLACE TO LIVE.

02:23.867 --> 02:26.667
AND BURKE'S PLACE--
I-I WAS THERE ONCE.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.567
I SUPPOSE ACTUALLY
IT'S YOUR PLACE NOW, RIGHT?

02:29.600 --> 02:31.800
NO,
IT'S STILL BURKE'S PLACE.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.633
NOW IT'S YOURS.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.300
(chuckles)

02:43.367 --> 02:45.833
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

02:45.867 --> 02:47.800
MEREDITH PUT HER MOM
IN A BAGGIE

02:47.833 --> 02:50.733
AND BROUGHT HER TO WORK.
I HAD TO GET HER
OUT OF MY CLOSET.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.100
SHE WAS HAUNTING ME.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.667
AND NOW SHE'S
HAUNTING US ALL.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.667
I'M PUTTING HER TO REST.
MEREDITH IS CLEANSING.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.433
IN TRIBAL CULTURE, WHEN ONE
WANTS TO CLEANSE THE PAST,

02:59.467 --> 03:02.400
ONE CUTS OFF ALL OF ONE'S HAIR
AND BURIES IT IN THE EARTH.

03:02.433 --> 03:05.167
YOU MIGHT TRY THAT, TOO.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.333
(Cristina) WHAT IS--
OKAY, LISTEN UP.

03:07.367 --> 03:10.233
TODAY IS A HOLIDAY, WHICH MEANS
THE PIT WILL BE OVERRUN.

03:10.267 --> 03:12.300
YOU'VE GOT THE USUAL
DRUNKEN STUPIDITY--

03:12.333 --> 03:13.800
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT

03:13.833 --> 03:16.300
SEATTLE'S ANNUAL CHAIN SAW
PUMPKIN CARVING CONTEST.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.233
I LOVE THIS CITY.
STAY ON YOUR TOES,

03:18.267 --> 03:20.133
STAY ON TOP
OF YOUR INTERNS, OKAY?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.733
SO WE SHOULD ROUND BEFORE
HEADING TO THE PIT OR--
YEAH,

03:22.767 --> 03:25.667
YOU SHOULD DIRECT YOUR QUESTIONS
TO DR. BAILEY, STEVENS.

03:25.700 --> 03:29.300
(Cristina) OH, WE'RE DIRECTING
OUR QUESTIONS TO DR. BAILEY?
OH, NOT YOU. JUST STEVENS.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.700
(Miranda) WHY IS STEVENS
DIRECTING HER QUESTIONS

03:31.733 --> 03:35.200
TO DR. BAILEY?
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN
SLEEPING WITH MY HUSBAND.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.400
ALL RIGHTY, THEN.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.633
OKAY, THIS IS
EVEN MORE DISTURBING

03:53.667 --> 03:55.500
THAN YOUR BAGFUL OF MOMMY.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.833
HIS MEDICATION WAS DUE
HALF AN HOUR AGO.

03:57.867 --> 04:00.800
I MEAN, THE MAN IS LIVING
IN THE HOSPITAL

04:00.833 --> 04:02.733
WHILE HE WAITS ON A HEART.
ERIN, HONEY.

04:02.767 --> 04:05.700
I'M THINKING IT'S KINDA HARD
FOR ANYONE TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY

04:05.733 --> 04:07.133
IN YOUR MOUSE COSTUME.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.200
SEE, I WORK
WITH 5 YEAR OLDS, DAD.

04:09.233 --> 04:12.400
MY COSTUME IS APPROPRIATE.
HERS IS NOT.

04:12.433 --> 04:14.667
LOOK, I'M--I'M JUST SAYING,

04:14.700 --> 04:16.567
IF YOU HAVE TIME
FOR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.500
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TIME
TO PROVIDE MY FATHER

04:18.533 --> 04:20.167
WITH BASIC CARE.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.400
HI, I'M DR. O'MALLEY.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.733
HI. WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FATHER RIGHT AWAY.

04:23.767 --> 04:25.733
THANK YOU.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.100
(lowered voice)
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS

04:27.133 --> 04:29.033
MAKE SURE
THEY HAVE THEIR MEDS

04:29.067 --> 04:30.800
BEFORE YOU DO
ANYTHING ELSE.
OKAY.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.200
THANKS.
I LIKE YOUR COSTUME.

04:33.233 --> 04:35.133
OH, WELL, DR. YANG SAID
THAT WE C--

04:35.167 --> 04:38.433
DR. YANG... (whispers)
IS SCREWING WITH YOU.

04:38.467 --> 04:41.400
OH, I KNEW IT.

04:41.433 --> 04:43.233
(laughs)
(sighs)

04:43.267 --> 04:44.633
(man)
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR?

04:44.667 --> 04:46.100
OH, I AM.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.833
GOOD.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.100
THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.
(stomps foot)

04:50.133 --> 04:51.767
IS YOUR LEG HURTING YOU?

04:51.800 --> 04:54.067
IT'S--IT'S NOT THE LEG.
IT'S THE FOOT.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.133
AND--AND IT'S NOT HURTING
SO MUCH AS--

04:56.167 --> 04:57.767
AS IT'S NOT MINE.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.500
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
I-I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

05:01.533 --> 05:04.267
BUT THIS--THIS FOOT
DOES NOT BELONG TO ME.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.467
IT--IT'S...

05:06.500 --> 05:08.133
IT...
(stomps foot)

05:08.167 --> 05:10.467
IT--IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S A CORPSE FOOT.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.067
OH, DID YOU LOSE FEELING
IN THE FOOT? IS IT NUMB?

05:13.100 --> 05:14.833
NO, IT'S--IT'S NOT NUMB.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.100
IT'S JUST...
IT'S NOT MINE.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.567
PLEASE, I'M--I'M NOT CRAZY.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.733
I-I WORK AT A BANK.
I'M NOT CRAZY. PLEASE.

05:21.767 --> 05:24.500
I JUST--
I-I NEED A SURGEON.

05:24.533 --> 05:27.400
I NEED YOU TO GET ME A SURGEON
WHO WILL REMOVE IT.

05:27.433 --> 05:30.600
A SURGEON WHO WILL
REMOVE YOUR FOOT?

05:30.633 --> 05:35.033
A SURGEON WHO WILL AMPUTATE
YOUR SEEMINGLY HEALTHY FOOT?

05:35.067 --> 05:38.433
(stomps foot twice)

05:40.533 --> 05:42.633
OH!
OH, MY GOD. OH.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.633
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S CHARTS.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.467
MEREDITH.
IT'S MY MOM.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.367
WHAT?
I HAD HER IN THE CUBBY,
AND SHE WAS FREAKING PEOPLE OUT.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.300
SO I WAS JUST GONNA GO
PUT HER IN THE CAR.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.300
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL,

05:55.333 --> 05:57.833
TO LEAVE HER IN THE CAR?
IT'S A LITTLE...

05:57.867 --> 05:59.800
IT'S NOT THAT STRANGE.
OH.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.733
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO PUT HER TO REST.

06:01.767 --> 06:04.300
I CAN'T SHOVE HER IN THE BACK
OF MY CLOSET ANYMORE.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.400
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER.
WELL--

06:06.433 --> 06:08.433
AND THIS IS ME
TRYING TO EVOLVE.

06:08.467 --> 06:11.567
I'M TRYING HERE.
SO... CUBBY OR CAR?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.467
YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I THINK
YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR MOM'S ASHES

06:14.500 --> 06:16.400
IN YOUR CUBBY OR YOUR CAR?

06:16.433 --> 06:18.767
OKAY, AND YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S VERY, VERY STRANGE?

06:18.800 --> 06:21.067
(boy) ARE THOSE REALLY
YOUR MOM'S ASHES?

06:21.100 --> 06:24.733
IT'S STRANGE, RIGHT?
IT'S STRANGE.
ARE YOU LOST?

06:24.767 --> 06:26.667
NO, MY MOM WORKS
IN THE CAFETERIA.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.600
AND SHE SAID I COULD
COME UP HERE

06:28.633 --> 06:30.733
AND LOOK FOR DR. SLOAN.
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

06:30.767 --> 06:32.500
UM, CAN YOU TAKE CARE
OF HIM?

06:32.533 --> 06:36.200
YEAH. CAN YOU...
TAKE CARE OF HER?

06:41.067 --> 06:43.300
GOOD MORNING.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.533
DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T SMILE AT ME.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.733
DON'T SMILE AT HER.
DON'T SMILE AT ME, EITHER.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.600
WE'RE ON TO YOU.
WE'VE COMPARED NOTES.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.200
COMPARED NOTES? REALLY?
MM-HMM.

06:52.233 --> 06:53.433
COMPARED NOTES,
COMPARED PICKUP LINES

06:53.467 --> 06:55.267
COMPARED TECHNIQUES.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.333
TECHNIQUES?

06:56.367 --> 06:58.433
IDENTICAL.
IDENTICAL.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.133
IDENTICAL?
WE FORMED A CLUB.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.400
NURSES UNITED
AGAINST MARK SLOAN.

07:04.067 --> 07:07.767
ARE THERE ANY, UH,
CLUB ACTIVITIES?

07:12.133 --> 07:14.833
OH, MAN. YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.767
THERE'S A, UH, KID
LOOKING FOR YOU.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.567
WHAT?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.133
DADDY?

07:20.167 --> 07:21.633
WHAT?

07:21.667 --> 07:24.233
(laughs)

07:24.267 --> 07:25.800
(Derek laughs)
NICELY DONE.

07:25.833 --> 07:28.667
THANKS.
I'LL BE GETTING YOU BACK
FOR THAT.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.700
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

07:30.733 --> 07:32.133
YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER.

07:32.167 --> 07:34.700
BUT I AM HOPING
YOU'LL BUILD ME SOME EARS.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.533
DR. KAREV, REQUEST FOR YOU.
CURTAIN THREE.

07:39.567 --> 07:42.200
DR. KAREV, I'M FEELING
A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.100
AND--AND RATHER THAN RISK
SPREADING GERMS TO THE PATIENTS,

07:45.133 --> 07:47.033
I THOUGHT I WOULD HEAD HOME
FOR THE DAY.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.800
NORMAN, DO YOU WANT
TO BE A SURGEON

07:48.833 --> 07:50.733
OR DO YOU WANT
TO GO TO BED?

07:50.767 --> 07:52.667
BECAUSE IT'S ONE
OR THE OTHER.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.633
SURGEONS STAND UP THROUGH 10-,
12-, 15-HOUR SURGERIES

07:54.667 --> 07:56.033
WITHOUT FOOD,
WITHOUT BATHROOM BREAKS

07:56.067 --> 07:57.533
WITHOUT COMPLAINTS.

07:57.567 --> 08:00.700
SURGEONS DO NOT GO HOME BECAUSE
WE HAVE A TICKLE IN OUR THROAT.

08:00.733 --> 08:03.600
WELL, IT'S NOT A TICKLE
IN MY THROAT AS MUCH AS--

08:03.633 --> 08:05.667
MAKE YOURSELF BUSY, NORMAN.
RIGHT.

08:05.700 --> 08:09.567
***

08:11.500 --> 08:13.400
ALL THE MOMS IN MY TOWN,

08:13.433 --> 08:16.033
THEY ALL DRESS UP
FOR HALLOWEEN.

08:16.067 --> 08:18.333
SO I WAS THINKING,
WHAT WOULD I WANT TO BE

08:18.367 --> 08:20.267
IF--IF I HAD TO DRESS UP
OR WHAT I--

08:20.300 --> 08:24.067
AND THE ONLY THING
I COULD COME UP WITH,

08:24.100 --> 08:26.100
THE ONLY THING
THAT I WANTED TO BE...

08:26.133 --> 08:28.400
WAS AVA.

08:28.433 --> 08:31.433
***

08:38.833 --> 08:42.000
***

08:51.233 --> 08:52.767
YOU FOUND HIM.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.767
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?
YOU KNOW HIS PARENTS?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.700
HIS MOM WORKS
IN THE CAFETERIA.

08:58.733 --> 09:01.500
WHAT'S ALL THIS?
IT'S LETTERS
FROM THE KIDS IN MY CLASS.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.100
LETTERS TO ME.

09:03.133 --> 09:05.300
HE HAS THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE
TO HEAR,

09:05.333 --> 09:08.233
HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE A CANAL
OR EXTERNAL STRUCTURE.

09:08.267 --> 09:10.167
SO I THOUGHT IF I CAME IN
WITH MY LETTERS,

09:10.200 --> 09:12.100
DR. SLOAN
MIGHT FEEL SORRY FOR ME

09:12.133 --> 09:14.533
AND DO THE SURGERY
FOR FREE.

09:14.567 --> 09:17.067
UH, LOOK, I'D LIKE TO HELP,
I WOULD IF I COULD,

09:17.100 --> 09:18.833
BUT PRO BONO SURGERY--
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW

09:18.867 --> 09:20.767
THAT ON MY WAY HERE
THIS MORNING,

09:20.800 --> 09:23.567
THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
THOUGHT I WAS IN A COSTUME.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.533
MY HEAD LOOKS LIKE
A PERMANENT HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.467
JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.533
YOU'RE GOOD.

09:30.567 --> 09:33.433
PRO BONO SURGERY IS NOT JUST
ABOUT ME GIVING YOU MY TIME.

09:33.467 --> 09:36.833
A SURGERY LIKE THIS
REQUIRES O.R. TIME,

09:36.867 --> 09:38.733
AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST,
A GENERAL SURGEON

09:38.767 --> 09:40.667
TO REMOVE THE CARTILAGE
FROM YOUR RIBS,

09:40.700 --> 09:43.200
AT LEAST TWO SURGICAL NURSES.

09:43.233 --> 09:45.133
COULDN'T YOU ASK THEM
FOR HELP?

09:45.167 --> 09:48.433
I COULD, BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANY SOCIAL CAPITAL.

09:48.467 --> 09:49.833
THE NURSES HATE ME.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.733
THEY'VE FORMED A CLUB
THAT'S ALL ABOUT HATING ME.

09:52.767 --> 09:55.400
AND THE OTHER DOCTORS
DON'T OWE ME ANY FAVORS

09:55.433 --> 09:57.500
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER
DONE ANY FOR THEM.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.167
I'M SORRY.
I WISH I COULD HELP.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.433
I WOULD IF I COULD.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.800
I HAVE SOCIAL CAPITAL.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.733
OR I DON'T.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.700
NOBODY KNOWS ME,
BUT THEY KNEW MY MOTHER.

10:10.733 --> 10:13.600
SO MAYBE
I CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

10:13.633 --> 10:14.800
FINE, MAKE IT HAPPEN.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.400
YOU MANAGE THAT,
I'M ALL YOURS.

10:17.433 --> 10:20.267
THESE PEOPLE
WHO KNEW YOUR MOTHER,

10:20.300 --> 10:23.467
DO THEY KNOW YOU BROUGHT HER
TO WORK IN A BAGGIE?

10:23.500 --> 10:26.500
***

10:31.667 --> 10:33.600
OH, YOU...

10:33.633 --> 10:36.400
(stammers)

10:36.433 --> 10:39.433
YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME.
YOU...

10:39.467 --> 10:41.333
YOU CHICKENED OUT.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.267
WHEN I--
WHEN I WAS LEAVING,

10:43.300 --> 10:45.400
WHEN I WAS...

10:45.433 --> 10:48.300
WHEN I ASKED YOU TO GIVE ME
A REASON TO STAY,

10:48.333 --> 10:49.833
YOU CHICKENED OUT,
WHICH I-I GET.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.167
I GET THAT. IT WAS A LOT.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.667
IT WAS SCARY, AND I-I KNOW
I CAN BE KINDA INTENSE,

10:54.700 --> 10:56.033
BUT I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT...

10:56.067 --> 10:57.567
OH!

10:57.600 --> 10:59.733
I THOUGHT AFTER THE--
THE CHICKENING OUT PART,

10:59.767 --> 11:01.533
I THOUGHT...

11:01.567 --> 11:04.333
YOU WOULD COME FOR ME.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.433
***

11:06.467 --> 11:07.767
I CAME BACK FOR YOU,

11:07.800 --> 11:09.467
WHICH BASICALLY...

11:09.500 --> 11:11.367
MAKES ME A BEGGAR.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.333
I'M A BEGGAR FOR HALLOWEEN.
AND NOW YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

11:15.367 --> 11:17.367
I'M NOT MOCKING YOU.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.400
***

11:23.267 --> 11:26.033
MM. WE NEED...

11:26.067 --> 11:27.667
TO TALK.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.733
WE WILL.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.600
***

11:31.633 --> 11:33.733
BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER?

11:33.767 --> 11:35.667
YOU CAN PRESCRIBE HIM
SOME ANTIANXIETY MEDS

11:35.700 --> 11:37.600
TO TRY TO LESSEN
THE URGENCY HE'S FEELING.

11:37.633 --> 11:40.800
THE MAN IS REQUESTING
AN AMPUTATION,

11:40.833 --> 11:42.700
AND THE BEST
YOU CAN COME UP WITH

11:42.733 --> 11:44.633
IS ANTIANXIETY MEDS?

11:44.667 --> 11:47.067
DR. BAILEY.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.567
CHAIN SAW CONTEST TIME?

11:48.600 --> 11:49.800
YEP.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.567
MR. MILLER.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.233
I HAVE TO GET TO THE E.R.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.167
BUT I'M GONNA WRITE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION

11:56.200 --> 11:59.100
FOR SOME MEDICATION
I THINK MAY HELP YOU.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.233
MEDICATION? I NEED--
I-I NEED A SURGEON.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.467
A SURGEON CAN TAKE OFF
THE FOOT.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.400
GET ME A SURGEON!

12:05.433 --> 12:08.233
I AM A SURGEON,
AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW

12:08.267 --> 12:11.033
THAT YOU WON'T PERSUADE ME
OR ANY OTHER SURGEON

12:11.067 --> 12:12.533
TO DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

12:12.567 --> 12:14.733
PLEASE TRY THIS MEDICATION.
(stomps foot)

12:14.767 --> 12:16.833
I HAVE AN EARLESS BOY.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.333
I'M SORRY?

12:19.367 --> 12:21.533
SLOAN HAS AGREED
TO BUILD HIM EARS PRO BONO

12:21.567 --> 12:24.433
IF YOU WILL DONATE THE O.R.
AND ALL THE EQUIPMENT--

12:24.467 --> 12:28.433
I'M SORRY, GREY.
MY PRO BONO SLATE IS FULL.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.233
THERE ARE PROTOCOLS
TO BE FOLLOWED,

12:30.267 --> 12:32.700
ALL SORTS OF RED TAPE--
TRICK OR TREAT.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.833
GET IT?
HE'S TRICK-OR-TREATING...

12:34.867 --> 12:37.600
FOR EARS.

12:37.633 --> 12:38.800
GREY--

12:38.833 --> 12:40.500
YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER,

12:40.533 --> 12:42.633
SHE WAS BIG
ON PRO BONO SURGERIES.

12:45.333 --> 12:49.133
O.R. 2 IS FREE
AT 6:00 P.M.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.100
THANK YOU.

12:51.133 --> 12:55.133
(siren wailing)

12:55.167 --> 12:58.267
IF YOU TWO NEED TO TALK,
I COULD WAIT OVER THERE.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.167
WHY? IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
ANY SECRETS ANYMORE.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.400
CALLIE TOLD EVERYONE.
EVERYONE.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.467
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG DAY.
(man) ERIN SHANLEY, 34,

13:05.500 --> 13:07.800
MASSIVE HEAD TRAUMA WHEN A BRICK
CAME THROUGH HER WINDSHIELD.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.733
G.C.S. OF 3 IN THE FIELD.
A BRICK CAME THROUGH
HER WINDSHIELD?

13:09.767 --> 13:12.033
DAMN KIDS WERE
SCREWING AROUND ON A BRIDGE,

13:12.067 --> 13:13.567
HALLOWEEN CRAP.
I'M LOOKING
AT BRAIN MATTER HERE.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.200
(man)
I CHECKED. SHE'S A DONOR.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.733
OH, MY GOD.

13:17.767 --> 13:18.867
WHAT?

13:18.900 --> 13:22.633
HER FATHER'S ON THREE.
HE'S WAITING FOR A NEW HEART.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.167
IT WAS AWESOME.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.467
IT WAS THE SICKEST PUMPKIN HEAD
YOU EVER SAW.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.267
MM-HMM.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.333
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

13:30.367 --> 13:32.267
IT'S, LIKE, BLOOD GUSHING,

13:32.300 --> 13:34.267
AND IT TOTALLY STAINED
MY PUMPKIN HEAD.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.100
YOU DON'T SAY?
MADE IT EVEN SICKER, THOUGH.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.700
I BROUGHT IT IN--THE DIGIT.
OH, YOU HAVE THE FINGER?

13:39.733 --> 13:42.833
YEAH, BUT IT'S, LIKE,
LODGED IN THE CHAIN SAW.

13:42.867 --> 13:44.267
WAIT.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.200
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.
WHO TOOK MY SAW?

13:46.233 --> 13:48.667
WHAT--SIR, THE CUT ISN'T
CLEAN ENOUGH

13:48.700 --> 13:50.333
TO CONSIDER RE--

13:50.367 --> 13:51.733
YO, WHO TOOK MY SAW?

13:51.767 --> 13:55.267
(electronic whirring)

13:55.300 --> 13:56.567
OH...

13:56.600 --> 13:59.167
OH, NO.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.567
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.300
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.800
(whirring continues)

14:03.833 --> 14:05.300
AAH!

14:05.333 --> 14:08.533
AAH!

14:08.567 --> 14:10.800
DUDE! SICK!

14:12.667 --> 14:13.467
THE TIBIAL NERVE IS SHOT.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.100
THERE'S NOTHING SALVAGEABLE
HERE.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.600
COMPLETELY MANGLED.

14:16.633 --> 14:20.033
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HELD THAT
SAW TO HIS LEG LONG ENOUGH--

14:20.067 --> 14:22.767
(Callie) WAS HE HIGH?
NO, I JUST GAVE HIM
SOME MORPHINE FOR THE PAIN,

14:22.800 --> 14:24.833
BUT THE TOX SCREEN
WAS CLEAN BEFORE THAT.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.767
UNBELIEVABLE. ALL RIGHT,
I'LL FINISH THE JOB.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.833
YANG, GO AHEAD AND PREP HIM
FOR COMPLETE AMPUTATION.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.633
THANK YOU.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.400
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:33.433 --> 14:34.800
HEY, YOU OKAY?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.800
HMM? OH, SEVERED LIMBS
DON'T SIT WELL WITH ME.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.400
JUST A LITTLE QUEASY IS ALL.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.133
BUT I'M FINE.
I'LL HELP DR. YANG.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.067
OKAY.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.533
(clears throat)

14:44.567 --> 14:46.667
GOTTA LOVE HALLOWEEN...

14:46.700 --> 14:49.200
WHEN ALL THE CRAZIES
COME OUT TO PLAY.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.133
MM, I KIND OF GET IT.

14:51.167 --> 14:54.033
I MEAN, I GET THAT YOU CAN
WAKE UP ONE DAY,

14:54.067 --> 14:56.400
AND YOUR LIFE DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE YOUR OWN.

14:56.433 --> 14:58.433
I HEARD...
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE.

14:58.467 --> 15:01.333
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED ME TO DO

15:01.367 --> 15:04.200
TO CHEER YOU UP,
I'M AROUND,

15:04.233 --> 15:06.533
DAY OR NIGHT--

15:06.567 --> 15:08.300
NIGHT IN PARTICULAR.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.800
(scoffs) I WAS MARRIED.

15:09.833 --> 15:11.733
I SAID "TILL DEATH
DO US PART," OKAY?

15:11.767 --> 15:13.133
IN A CHURCH.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.067
I MEAN, IT WAS
THE CHURCH OF ELVIS,

15:15.100 --> 15:17.533
BUT STILL IT WAS A CHURCH.

15:17.567 --> 15:18.767
I JUST... (sighs)

15:18.800 --> 15:21.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS MY LIFE.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.467
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.600
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

15:26.633 --> 15:29.233
(sighs)

15:29.267 --> 15:31.300
INJURIES LIKE THESE
HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.800
SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T FEEL
ANY PAIN AT ALL.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.700
M-MR. SHANLEY.

15:36.733 --> 15:37.633
HMM?

15:37.667 --> 15:39.800
ACCORDING TO ERIN'S
DRIVER'S LICENSE...

15:39.833 --> 15:42.700
SHE WAS AN ORGAN DONOR.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.633
AND AS NEXT OF KIN,

15:46.667 --> 15:50.700
IF YOU AGREE TO TAKE HER
OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT,

15:50.733 --> 15:54.167
YOU COULD DIRECT THE HEART
TO YOURSELF.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.700
SHE IS YOUNG,
SHE WAS HEALTHY.

15:59.733 --> 16:02.167
SHE WOULD BE A PERFECT MATCH
FOR YOU, SIR.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.067
COULD YOU JUST PLEASE
GO AWAY?
MR. SHANLEY,
IF YOU WOULD JUST--

16:05.100 --> 16:08.400
PLEASE, PLEASE GO AWAY.
PLEASE.

16:08.433 --> 16:12.467
DR. O'MALLEY WILL BRING YOU
TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER

16:12.500 --> 16:14.433
IF YOU LIKE.

16:14.467 --> 16:17.467
(crying)

16:21.367 --> 16:22.833
OH! OH!

16:22.867 --> 16:24.767
OH, SO SORRY.
EXCUSE ME. YOU OKAY?

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
OH, NO, NO.
NO APOLOGY NECESSARY.
OKAY.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.533
I'M SYDNEY, BY THE WAY.
OH.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.533
DR. SYDNEY HERON.
GENERAL SURGERY.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.067
BIG FAN OF YOUR WORK. YEAH.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.800
UH, WE WERE SEATED TOGETHER
ONCE AT AN M&M.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.233
ANYWAY, UH, NOW SEEMS
AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY

16:37.267 --> 16:39.200
TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL--
OUR INTRODUCTION.
AH, DEREK SHEPHERD.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.367
PLEASURE.
IT'S, UH, IT'S VERY,
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.033
NICE MEETING YOU, TOO.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.833
(giggles)

16:44.867 --> 16:47.067
(laughs)

16:47.100 --> 16:48.700
YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTY?

16:48.733 --> 16:52.567
YEAH.
I LIKE CHEERFUL PEOPLE.
I CAN BE CHEERFUL.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.733
I THINK THE ASHES THING
MAKES THAT KINDA UNLIKELY.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.033
DR. BAILEY,
WE'RE GONNA HELP, UH,

16:59.067 --> 17:02.267
REBUILD A LITTLE BOY'S EARS
TODAY, PRO BONO.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.133
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD DONATE SOME TIME.

17:04.167 --> 17:06.067
UH, THANKS TO THE FINE,
UPSTANDING CITIZEN

17:06.100 --> 17:07.833
WHO CUT OFF HIS FOOT
ON MY WATCH,

17:07.867 --> 17:09.833
I'VE GOT
A MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK.

17:09.867 --> 17:13.100
ON TOP OF THAT, I PROMISED
TO TRY AND GET OUT HERE

17:13.133 --> 17:15.633
IN TIME TO SEE MY SON
IN HIS HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

17:15.667 --> 17:19.400
IS TUCK EVEN OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW WHAT HALLOWEEN IS?

17:19.433 --> 17:22.800
HE'S NOT, BUT HIS FATHER IS,
AND THAT'S WHO I PROMISED.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.433
TRICK OR TREAT.

17:28.133 --> 17:29.300
FOR EARS?

17:29.333 --> 17:31.267
HE'S TRICK-OR-TREATING
FOR EARS?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.767
YEAH.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.133
COULD YOU ALSO PERSUADE

17:35.167 --> 17:37.700
SOME OF THE SURGICAL NURSES
TO HELP OUT?

17:37.733 --> 17:40.667
THEY SEEM
TO REALLY LIKE YOU.
TRICK OR TREAT.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.733
UH, STOP THAT.

17:42.767 --> 17:45.633
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

17:50.633 --> 17:54.133
(Mr. Shanley sighs)

17:54.167 --> 17:57.100
SHE'S WARM.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

17:57.133 --> 17:59.367
I'M--I'M SORRY.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.167
SHE'S BREATHING
WITH THE HELP OF MACHINES.

18:02.200 --> 18:06.467
ERIN--
THE PERSON THAT YOU KNEW--

18:06.500 --> 18:08.567
ISN'T THERE ANYMORE.

18:16.167 --> 18:19.300
UH... WOULD YOU BRING
THE PAPERWORK?

18:19.333 --> 18:21.767
MM-HMM.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.667
YOU CAN HAVE HER...
HAVE HER--HER ORGANS.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.033
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTED.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.767
AND HER HEART?

18:31.633 --> 18:34.400
GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.067
WE COULD SCATTER HER
OFF THE ROOF.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.067
SHE WAS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.233
THEY'RE ASHES, MEREDITH.
THE ASHES AREN'T ACROPHOBIC.

18:45.267 --> 18:47.700
I NEED TO PUT
MY MOTHER TO REST.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.767
I NEED TO NOT BECOME HER.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.100
I NEED TO NOT DIE
EMOTIONALLY CRIPPLED AND ALONE.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.467
AND I NEED
TO NOT ATTEND THE WEDDING

18:54.500 --> 18:56.567
OF DEREK SHEPHERD
AND SYDNEY HERON.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.500
I NEED TO PUT
MY MOTHER TO REST.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.267
SYDNEY HERON?

19:00.300 --> 19:03.300
***

19:05.700 --> 19:08.267
(coughs)

19:08.300 --> 19:09.767
(clears throat)

19:09.800 --> 19:13.100
***

19:14.367 --> 19:16.200
JUST ASK.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.567
SO YOU TWO ARE TOGETHER?

19:19.600 --> 19:21.367
YEAH.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.300
LIKE "TOGETHER" TOGETHER,
IN LOVE TOGETHER?

19:23.333 --> 19:24.833
SEXY LOVE, NOT SIBLING LOVE?

19:24.867 --> 19:26.733
YES. YEAH.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.267
WE'RE TOGETHER.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.300
AND...

19:30.333 --> 19:32.033
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN...

19:32.067 --> 19:34.067
I MEAN,
WITHOUT ANY OF US KNOWING--

19:34.100 --> 19:36.267
DOING THIS
THE WHOLE TIME?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.633
JUST ONCE.
IZ.

19:37.667 --> 19:40.700
I SAID
SHE COULD ASK QUESTIONS.

19:40.733 --> 19:43.100
JUST ONCE.

19:43.133 --> 19:46.533
AND NOW WE'RE WAITING TO...
BE TOGETHER...

19:46.567 --> 19:48.200
OUT OF RESPECT.

19:48.233 --> 19:50.200
FOR CALLIE'S FEELINGS.
(scoffs)

19:50.233 --> 19:54.400
***

19:54.433 --> 19:57.067
SHE'S NOT JUDGING.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.333
RIGHT.

19:58.367 --> 20:01.633
***

20:01.667 --> 20:04.533
I HAVE AN EARLESS BOY
WAITING FOR ME.

20:04.567 --> 20:06.067
(clicks tongue)

20:06.100 --> 20:07.833
BUT...

20:07.867 --> 20:10.333
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

20:10.367 --> 20:14.300
***

20:14.333 --> 20:17.400
(pager beeps)

20:19.500 --> 20:20.833
NORMAN.

20:20.867 --> 20:22.233
DO YOU HAVE TO GO?

20:22.267 --> 20:23.367
NO.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.700
NORMAN CAN GET BY FOR
A FEW MORE MINUTES WITHOUT ME.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.733
HOW ARE YOU?

20:28.767 --> 20:31.433
I MEAN, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

20:31.467 --> 20:33.367
I'M IN LOVE
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.567
SHE'S PERFECT. SHE'S...

20:34.600 --> 20:36.500
I MEAN,
SHE SUCKS ON HER FINGERS.

20:36.533 --> 20:38.200
IT'S HER NEW THING.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.167
AND SHE MAKES, LIKE,

20:39.200 --> 20:43.833
THIS PERFECT LITTLE
CARTOON SUCKLING SOUND.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.433
AND YOUR HUSBAND?

20:48.167 --> 20:51.300
MY HUSBAND'S IN LOVE
WITH MY DAUGHTER, TOO.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.800
YOU LOOK TIRED.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.567
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING MUCH.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.767
I HAVEN'T
BEEN SLEEPING MUCH EITHER.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.300
THE BABY
WAKES UP ALL THE TIME.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.500
NOT AS MUCH
NOW THAT I FIGURED OUT

21:04.533 --> 21:06.167
THAT IF WRAP HER

21:06.200 --> 21:08.267
IN WHATEVER SHIRT
I'M WEARING...

21:08.300 --> 21:10.333
MM. SHE SMELLS YOU. YEAH.

21:10.367 --> 21:14.033
YEAH. AND SHE SLEEPS.

21:14.067 --> 21:16.267
ALEX...

21:16.300 --> 21:17.633
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.167
I MEAN, WHAT ARE--

21:19.200 --> 21:21.333
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.667
(mumbles softly)

21:32.767 --> 21:34.067
(Richard) DR. HAHN.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.067
THANK YOU FOR COMING
AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
OH, NOT A PROBLEM.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.833
ARE WE HARVESTING THE HEART
FOR U.N.O.S.,

21:38.867 --> 21:40.700
OR IS THE RECIPIENT HERE?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.633
I'M HOPING
THE RECIPIENT IS HERE,

21:42.667 --> 21:44.167
BUT HE HASN'T AGREED YET.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.833
I'VE NEVER HAD MUCH TROUBLE
TALKING A HEART PATIENT

21:46.867 --> 21:49.300
INTO TAKING A HEART.
IT'S HIS DAUGHTER'S HEART.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.700
OKAY.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.300
(Cristina) YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:52.333 --> 21:53.900
GET HIM TO O.R. TWO
AND PAGE TORRES.

21:53.933 --> 21:56.500
OKAY.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
(Richard) HIS DAUGHTER WAS
IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT.

21:56.533 --> 21:59.200
HEY, UH,
WHAT'S HAHN DOING HERE?
SHE'S BEEN DECLARED
BRAIN DEAD...

21:59.233 --> 22:00.700
HEART TRANSPLANT.

22:00.733 --> 22:03.033
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S MY PATIENT.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.500
DR. HAHN, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
DOING A HEART TRANSPLANT TODAY,

22:05.533 --> 22:07.533
AND I THOUGHT I'D VOLUNTEER
TO SCRUB IN.

22:07.567 --> 22:09.400
ISOBEL STEVENS.
SHE'S MY PATIENT, THE DONOR.

22:09.433 --> 22:12.300
SO IF YOU NEED ANY INFORMATION,
I HAVE IT, ALL OF IT.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.667
SHE'S--SHE'S MY PATIENT.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.167
YOU'VE GOT SOME EAGER
JUNIOR RESIDENTS AROUND HERE.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.533
MM, LUCKY ME.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.133
TAKE YOUR PICK.

22:19.167 --> 22:21.367
WELL, YANG,
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

22:21.400 --> 22:23.300
BUT I DATE MEN.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.200
SO I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO IMPRESS ME

22:26.233 --> 22:29.667
THE WAY YOU'VE IMPRESSED
YOUR MENTORS IN THE PAST.
I... WHAT?

22:29.700 --> 22:32.067
YOU SLEEP WITH THEM,
RIGHT?

22:32.100 --> 22:35.333
PRESTON BURKE, COLIN MARLOWE--
THAT'S YOUR THING.

22:35.367 --> 22:37.267
IT'S MY--IT'S--
I'M--I'M SORRY.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.433
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

22:39.467 --> 22:42.333
MY THEORY IS IF YOU HAD
THE CHOPS IN THE O.R.,

22:42.367 --> 22:45.300
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO TRY
TO IMPRESS IN THE BEDROOM.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.400
STEVENS, IS IT?
IT IS.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.000
LET'S GO, STEVENS.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.200
YOU KNOW, I BUST MY ASS HERE,

22:56.233 --> 22:58.733
AND BURKE SKIPS TOWN
WITH MY CARDIO REPUTATION.

22:58.767 --> 23:00.667
SO NOW INSTEAD OF
A HEART TRANSPLANT,

23:00.700 --> 23:02.700
OH, I GET TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE AMPUTATION

23:02.733 --> 23:04.633
OF A CRAZY MAN'S FOOT.
I'M NOT--

23:04.667 --> 23:06.600
CRAZY. CUTTING OFF
YOUR FOOT IS CRAZY.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.700
WALKING THROUGH YOUR LIFE
LIKE YOU HAVE NO POWER,

23:08.733 --> 23:11.667
LIKE YOU HAVE NO SAY--
NO SAY IN YOUR OWN DESTINY--

23:11.700 --> 23:14.567
LIKE YOU HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER YOUR OWN BODY,

23:14.600 --> 23:18.800
WALKING THROUGH LIFE
LIKE THAT IS WHAT'S CRAZY.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.700
HMM. I STILL THINK
IT'S CUTTING OFF YOUR FOOT

23:21.733 --> 23:24.067
WITH A CHAIN SAW
THAT'S CRAZY.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.633
MR. SHANLEY, I'M DR. HAHN.

23:28.667 --> 23:32.033
THE TRANSPLANT TEAM
IS IN PLACE

23:32.067 --> 23:35.233
IF YOU'RE READY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

23:35.267 --> 23:38.200
YOU MUST NOT HAVE CHILDREN.

23:38.233 --> 23:39.833
I'M SORRY?

23:39.867 --> 23:41.833
IF YOU HAD CHILDREN,
YOU'D NEVER SAY THAT.

23:41.867 --> 23:46.100
YOU'D NEVER SAY, "IF YOU'RE
READY TO SAY GOOD-BYE."

23:46.133 --> 23:48.767
MR. SHANLEY, I'M VERY SORRY,

23:48.800 --> 23:51.833
BUT I WANT TO SUGGEST
ONE LAST TIME--

23:51.867 --> 23:53.767
NO, I AM NOT TAKING
HER HEART.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.767
I CAN'T HAVE
MY DAUGHTER'S HEART

23:55.800 --> 23:58.267
BEATING IN MY CHEST.

23:58.300 --> 24:01.333
IT WOULD HAUNT ME EVERY DAY
OF MY LIFE. NO!
ALL RIGHT.

24:01.367 --> 24:03.700
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

24:05.267 --> 24:08.233
PAGE ME WHEN HE'S READY.

24:13.133 --> 24:14.733
MR. SHANLEY...

24:16.200 --> 24:17.600
I DON'T HAVE KIDS,

24:17.633 --> 24:20.500
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE A CHILD,

24:20.533 --> 24:22.667
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE A PARENT.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.700
YOUR DAUGHTER LOVED YOU.
I SAW HER THIS MORNING.

24:24.733 --> 24:27.067
SHE WAS FIGHTING FOR YOU.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.200
SHE WAS FIGHTING
FOR YOUR LIFE.

24:29.233 --> 24:32.200
YOU'RE HER DAD.

24:32.233 --> 24:34.833
YOU'RE HER DAD.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU.

24:34.867 --> 24:36.833
I KNOW THAT.

24:36.867 --> 24:41.633
I ALSO KNOW THAT SHE WOULD
WANT YOU TO HAVE HER HEART.

24:45.267 --> 24:49.467
I WOULD'VE GIVEN MY DAD
MY HEART IF I COULD.

24:51.133 --> 24:54.233
IF I COULD'VE SAVED HIM...

24:54.267 --> 24:57.300
I WOULD'VE GIVEN HIM
MY HEART.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.367
ALL RIGHT.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.800
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
HAHN CHOSE ME.

25:22.833 --> 25:25.133
WHATEVER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU
ARE JUDGING ME.

25:25.167 --> 25:28.100
THAT AFTER WHAT HAHN SAID
TO YOU, THAT YOU ARE JUDGING ME.

25:28.133 --> 25:30.367
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.267
IT IS THE SAME THING.
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.133
I'M SORRY THAT I HURT CALLIE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HER.

25:37.167 --> 25:38.200
YOU SLEPT WITH HER HUSBAND.

25:38.233 --> 25:41.400
I SLEPT WITH MY BOYFRIEND.
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

25:41.433 --> 25:45.067
MEREDITH SLEPT WITH
ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.800
MEREDITH SLEPT WITH
ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.167
THE TWO OF YOU ARE LIKE
THIS CLOSED CIRCLE.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.033
YOU CAN COMMIT
WHATEVER CRIME YOU WANT,

25:51.067 --> 25:53.133
AND IN YOUR LITTLE CIRCLE,
IT'S ALL FINE.

25:53.167 --> 25:54.267
I...

25:54.300 --> 25:57.300
I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T
SLEEP WITH BURKE TO GET AHEAD.

25:57.333 --> 26:00.733
AND IF HAHN HAD ASKED ME,
I WOULD'VE DEFENDED YOU.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.133
I'M NOT EVEN ASKING YOU
TO DEFEND ME.

26:03.167 --> 26:06.500
I'M ASKING YOU TO JUST
CUT ME AN INCH OF SLACK.

26:06.533 --> 26:11.100
AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY
THAT I AM SORRY I HURT CALLIE.

26:11.133 --> 26:14.267
WE ARE NOT A CLOSED CIRCLE.

26:14.300 --> 26:18.167
(scoffs) YOU ARE.

26:23.267 --> 26:24.300
DR. SHEPHERD.
YES.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.467
HERE'S A QUESTION--
WERE THERE ACTUAL SHEPHERDS

26:26.500 --> 26:29.300
IN YOUR LINEAGE?
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

26:29.333 --> 26:32.300
YOU KNOW, SHEPHERDS. THE ONES
WHO WATCH OVER SHEEP.

26:33.867 --> 26:35.767
YOU KNOW, I--I'M SORRY.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

26:35.800 --> 26:37.767
OF COURSE.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.767
(laughs) YEAH,
YOU DID THIS.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.100
PAYBACK'S A BITCH.
OH, MAN. WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU TELL HER?

26:42.133 --> 26:44.800
I PUT THE WORD OUT
THAT YOU WERE LOOKIN'.
THAT I'M LOOKING?

26:44.833 --> 26:47.600
LOOKIN'. IT SOUNDS
WAY DIRTIER WITHOUT THE "G."

26:47.633 --> 26:50.500
AND YOU WONDER
WHY THEY FORMED A CLUB?
YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?

26:50.533 --> 26:52.233
YEAH.

26:52.267 --> 26:54.467
OKAY, SO WE HAVE
ONE PLASTIC SURGEON,

26:54.500 --> 26:57.233
A GENERAL SURGEON,
AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST,

26:57.267 --> 27:01.500
ONE, TWO, THREE SCRUB NURSES
AND AN O.R.

27:01.533 --> 27:04.667
LET'S CALL YOUR MOM, KID.
YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME EARS.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.667
HE CUT OFF HIS FOOT.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.200
YEAH.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.233
HE CUT OFF
HIS PERFECTLY GOOD FOOT.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.167
WELL, PEOPLE DO
SOME VERY STRANGE THINGS.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.800
OH, WELL.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.367
I HAD THE WORLD'S
SHORTEST MARRIAGE.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.200
(chuckles)

27:24.233 --> 27:26.133
I WAS LEFT IN A CHURCH

27:26.167 --> 27:29.500
WHILE I WAS LITERALLY WEARING
A WEDDING DRESS.
HMM.

27:29.533 --> 27:32.533
(both laughing)

27:33.800 --> 27:36.400
GEORGE CHEATED ON ME
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

27:36.433 --> 27:37.633
AND I MISSED IT.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.600
(laughs)

27:39.633 --> 27:43.233
BURKE SENT HIS MOTHER TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO ME. MM-HMM.

27:43.267 --> 27:45.200
(laughing) I'M GONNA BE
A DIVORCéE.

27:45.233 --> 27:48.067
NOW ERICA HAHN THINKS
I'M A FRAUD. (laughing)

27:48.100 --> 27:51.167
I'M, UH,
I'M NOT FEELING VERY...

27:51.200 --> 27:52.600
(laughs)

27:52.633 --> 27:53.633
NORMAN!

27:53.667 --> 27:55.167
NORMAN?

27:58.500 --> 27:59.800
(pager beeps)

28:05.800 --> 28:08.333
OH, CRAP.
HMM? WHAT?

28:08.367 --> 28:11.133
MY INTERN,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

28:13.433 --> 28:15.400
WE NEED TO TALK.

28:15.433 --> 28:17.600
WELL, WE WILL.
I'LL COME BACK. OKAY?

28:17.633 --> 28:20.233
OKAY.

28:20.267 --> 28:22.533
DON'T CHICKEN OUT.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.033
YOU KNOW, I'M IMPRESSED.

28:27.067 --> 28:29.133
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D PULL THIS OFF.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.367
I'M ACTUALLY
PRETTY SURPRISED MYSELF,

28:30.400 --> 28:32.033
CONSIDERING IT WAS

28:32.067 --> 28:33.600
MY FIRST TIME
TRICK-OR-TREATING.

28:33.633 --> 28:35.267
YOUR FIRST TIME?

28:35.300 --> 28:38.333
YEAH. MY MOM NEVER MADE IT
HOME IN TIME TO TAKE ME,

28:38.367 --> 28:40.667
NEVER GOT IT TOGETHER
TO MAKE ME A COSTUME.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.567
PLUS SHE SAID IT WAS RUDE
TO KNOCK ON PEOPLE'S DOORS

28:43.600 --> 28:45.133
AND BEG FOR FOOD.

28:45.167 --> 28:47.233
HUH.

28:49.300 --> 28:51.200
WHAT?

28:51.233 --> 28:53.333
JUST...

28:53.367 --> 28:56.667
THE APPLE FELL PRETTY FAR
FROM THE TREE, HUH?

28:56.700 --> 28:59.700
***

29:10.500 --> 29:13.367
DR. KAREV,
YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN?

29:13.400 --> 29:16.800
I JUST HEARD.
DID HE HAVE A STROKE?

29:16.833 --> 29:19.667
HE DID. 3 INCHES TO THE LEFT,
HE'D NEVER TALK AGAIN.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.500
YEAH, BUT IT'S
GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?
NO WAY TO KNOW

29:22.533 --> 29:24.733
TILL WE GET THE CLOT OUT
AND HE WAKES UP.

29:24.767 --> 29:28.300
BUT HE--BUT HE'S GONNA
BE OKAY--
KAREV, STOP TALKING.

29:28.333 --> 29:32.267
***

29:38.767 --> 29:41.700
IS YOUR MARRIAGE
REALLY OVER?

29:41.733 --> 29:44.467
YEAH.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.833
I'M SORRY.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.733
THANKS.

29:47.767 --> 29:50.633
DID MEREDITH REALLY BRING
HER MOM'S ASHES TO WORK?

29:50.667 --> 29:54.433
***

30:05.733 --> 30:09.200
***

30:11.600 --> 30:13.833
LOOK AT THAT.

30:13.867 --> 30:16.400
NOT A BAD DAY'S WORK.

30:16.433 --> 30:20.200
***

30:20.233 --> 30:23.067
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)
PADDLES.

30:23.100 --> 30:26.500
***

30:26.533 --> 30:28.467
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.800

30:33.633 --> 30:35.200
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:35.233 --> 30:36.467
THERE IT IS.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.500

30:41.767 --> 30:44.267
THERE IT IS.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.833
COME ON.

30:45.867 --> 30:48.500
NORMAN, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

30:48.533 --> 30:52.667
***

30:52.700 --> 30:54.533
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:54.567 --> 30:58.433
***

31:01.467 --> 31:03.367
I JUST SAW
A HEART TRANSPLANT.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.267
I JUST HELPED BUILD
A LITTLE BOY SOME EARS.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.600
THAT'S COOL.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.400
YEAH.

31:09.433 --> 31:13.033
I DUG UP MY MOM'S CAT.

31:13.067 --> 31:14.433
WHAT?

31:14.467 --> 31:16.767
MY MOM DIDN'T LEAVE
ANY INSTRUCTIONS

31:16.800 --> 31:20.167
'CAUSE IT WAS SO...
UNEXPECTED.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.600
SO...

31:21.633 --> 31:23.533
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT
ON OUR OWN

31:23.567 --> 31:25.467
WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.600
AND MY MOM LOVED THAT CAT.

31:27.633 --> 31:29.633
SO... I DUG HER UP--

31:29.667 --> 31:31.200
THE CAT--

31:31.233 --> 31:33.600
UM, FROM HER LITTLE GRAVE
IN OUR BACKYARD.

31:33.633 --> 31:37.100
AND I SNUCK INTO THE CEMETERY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

31:37.133 --> 31:39.733
AND REBURIED HER
RIGHT BESIDE MY MOM.

31:39.767 --> 31:43.700
AND... IT WAS CREEPY
AND MORBID,

31:43.733 --> 31:47.433
CARRYING AROUND A DEAD,
DECAYING CAT IN THE CEMETERY

31:47.467 --> 31:49.367
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

31:49.400 --> 31:51.633
BUT...

31:51.667 --> 31:53.800
IT MADE MY MOM REALLY HAPPY.

31:53.833 --> 31:55.800
AT LEAST...

31:55.833 --> 31:58.200
I LIKE TO THINK IT DID.

31:58.233 --> 32:01.100
***

32:01.133 --> 32:02.333
THANKS.

32:02.367 --> 32:04.233
YOU'RE WELCOME.

32:04.267 --> 32:06.467
***

32:06.500 --> 32:09.233
LOOK, TUCKER,
I SAID I'M SORRY.

32:09.267 --> 32:11.733
NO. I DIDN'T...

32:11.767 --> 32:14.433
NO, I...

32:14.467 --> 32:16.467
TUCKER...

32:19.767 --> 32:22.000
PERFECT.

32:26.767 --> 32:29.033
HI.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.300
WE JUST PUT
A MAN'S DAUGHTER'S HEART

32:37.333 --> 32:39.600
IN HIS CHEST.

32:39.633 --> 32:40.833
HIS DAUGHTER'S HEART?

32:40.867 --> 32:42.267
MM-HMM.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.567
WELL, THAT JUST MAKES YOU
WANT TO THROW UP,

32:44.600 --> 32:47.333
NOW DOESN'T IT?

32:47.367 --> 32:49.633
YOU ALL RIGHT?

32:55.200 --> 32:57.100
YOU'RE DR. BAILEY.
YOU HEAR EVERYTHING.

32:57.133 --> 32:59.033
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
EVERYTHING,

32:59.067 --> 33:00.433
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD.

33:00.467 --> 33:03.367
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE?
YEAH, I PROBABLY WOULD'VE.

33:05.633 --> 33:09.700
I'M SORRY... IF I...

33:09.733 --> 33:11.667
DISAPPOINTED YOU.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.600
I'M NOT YOUR MOTHER,
O'MALLEY.

33:13.633 --> 33:16.167
OH. OH.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.667
OH, I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO HER NOW, TOO.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.467
(sighs)

33:21.500 --> 33:25.133
O'MALLEY.

33:25.167 --> 33:27.700
(sighs)
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT A BAD GUY.

33:27.733 --> 33:30.600
AND I DON'T MEAN TO LET YOU
OFF THE HOOK ENTIRELY,

33:30.633 --> 33:33.100
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DID
WAS UNKIND

33:33.133 --> 33:36.700
AND HURTFUL AND WRONG.

33:36.733 --> 33:38.800
BUT YOU'RE NOT A BAD GUY.

33:38.833 --> 33:42.333
I'M--I'M JUST SAYING, IT...
IT TAKES TWO.

33:42.367 --> 33:45.533
TO REACH THE POINT
YOU REACHED IN YOUR MARRIAGE,

33:45.567 --> 33:47.500
IT TAKES TWO.

33:47.533 --> 33:51.633
I MEAN--I MEAN, I'M HERE
LATE AT NIGHT, HALLOWEEN,

33:51.667 --> 33:54.500
HELPING AN EARLESS BOY
GET EARS,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.433
AND MY HUSBAND
WANTS TO ACT LIKE

33:56.467 --> 33:58.833
THAT ISN'T AN IMPORTANT THING.

33:58.867 --> 34:00.567
HE WANTS TO ACT LIKE...

34:00.600 --> 34:02.800
IT ISN'T A GOOD THING
THAT I DID TODAY.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.733
NOW THAT ISN'T JUST ON ME.

34:04.767 --> 34:07.633
THAT'S HIM WANTING THINGS
TO BE THE WAY HE WANTS.

34:07.667 --> 34:12.833
THAT'S HIM WANTING THINGS
TO BE PURELY BLACK-AND-WHITE.

34:12.867 --> 34:17.067
I MEAN, I MISSED MY SON'S
FIRST HALLOWEEN,

34:17.100 --> 34:20.167
AND MY HEART IS ACHING
INSIDE OF MY CHEST,

34:20.200 --> 34:23.333
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

34:23.367 --> 34:24.600
IT--IT DOESN'T COUNT

34:24.633 --> 34:26.667
BECAUSE
IN A BLACK-AND-WHITE WORLD,

34:26.700 --> 34:28.800
I SIMPLY DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME,

34:28.833 --> 34:31.633
AND THAT MAKES ME
THE BAD GUY.

34:31.667 --> 34:33.567
YOU KNOW, ALWAYS.
I'M ALWAYS THE BAD GUY.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.133
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:42.367 --> 34:45.333
SORRY YOU MISSED
YOUR SON'S FIRST HALLOWEEN.

34:47.433 --> 34:51.467
LOOK, WHAT I'M SAYING
TO YOU IS...

34:51.500 --> 34:53.400
OKAY, I WAS THERE.
ALL RIGHT?

34:53.433 --> 34:56.567
I WAS THERE THE DAY
YOUR FATHER DIED.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.500
I WAS THERE WHEN YOU
CAME BACK FROM VEGAS,

34:59.533 --> 35:04.033
MARRIED AFTER A WEEK AND...

35:04.067 --> 35:06.633
ALL I'M SAYING IS...

35:06.667 --> 35:09.167
IT'S NOT BLACK-AND-WHITE...

35:09.200 --> 35:12.467
AND YOU'RE NOT A BAD GUY.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.300
(woman) PAGING DR. BENDER.

35:22.333 --> 35:25.400
PAGING DR. BENDER, PLEASE.

35:26.267 --> 35:28.167
I DID NOT SLEEP MY WAY
TO THE TOP.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.533
I'M ATTRACTED TO A TALENT
THAT RESEMBLES MY OWN,

35:30.567 --> 35:33.133
NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

35:33.167 --> 35:34.633
YOUR COMMENTS
WERE UNPROFESSIONAL

35:34.667 --> 35:36.033
AND INAPPROPRIATE.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:37.600 --> 35:39.500
YOU'RE INAPPROPRIATE
AND UNPROFESSIONAL.

35:39.533 --> 35:42.067
(chuckles) THIS IS
GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.667
DR. YANG, DID YOU HEAR?

35:44.700 --> 35:46.333
DR. HAHN HAS AGREED

35:46.367 --> 35:49.000
TO BECOME OUR NEW HEAD
OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.200
LOOKIN' FORWARD TO IT,
DR. YANG.

35:55.767 --> 35:58.033
YOU CAN'T HAVE MY APARTMENT.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.733
I'M... SORRY
I DIDN'T LISTEN

36:03.767 --> 36:05.800
WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL.

36:05.833 --> 36:08.400
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR PAGE.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.633
DO YOU KNOW
WHY I CHOSE SURGERY?
NO.

36:11.667 --> 36:15.200
I'M A LITTLE SOUTH OF 60
AND BLOOD MAKES ME SQUEAMISH.

36:15.233 --> 36:17.267
SEE, I WANTED TO GO INTO PSYCH
BECAUSE I LIKE TO TALK.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.833
I'VE NOTICED THAT.

36:18.867 --> 36:21.167
(chuckles) BUT I HAD
THIS VOICE IN MY HEAD

36:21.200 --> 36:23.733
TELLING ME TO CHOOSE SURGERY.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.800
IT WAS AS IF...

36:25.833 --> 36:29.567
MY MARY BETH WAS WHISPERING
IN MY EAR.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.500
AND SO I LISTENED.

36:31.533 --> 36:34.400
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK NOW?

36:34.433 --> 36:35.467
NO.

36:35.500 --> 36:39.400
I THINK I WAS ABOUT TO HAVE
A MASSIVE STROKE...

36:39.433 --> 36:43.500
AND MY MARY BETH WANTED ME
TO BE SURROUNDED BY...

36:43.533 --> 36:47.067
WORLD-CLASS SURGEONS
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

36:48.700 --> 36:52.233
MM. SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

36:52.267 --> 36:54.167
UH, WELL, I'M GONNA GO
INTO PSYCH.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.067
BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE,
YOU SURGEONS,

36:56.100 --> 36:58.800
MY GOD... YOU'RE ALL JUST
A BUNCH OF LITTLE CHILDREN

36:58.833 --> 37:00.733
RUNNING AROUND
WITH YOUR SCALPELS

37:00.767 --> 37:02.267
AND YOUR SEVERED FEET

37:02.300 --> 37:05.067
AND YOUR INAPPROPRIATE SEX
IN INAPPROPRIATE PLACES.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.100
YOU ALL NEED A GOOD SHRINK.

37:14.867 --> 37:17.400
DR. GREY?

37:17.433 --> 37:18.533
HI.

37:18.567 --> 37:20.733
HI.

37:20.767 --> 37:22.400
I HAD A GOLDFISH,

37:22.433 --> 37:25.300
AND WHEN HE DIED,
WE FLUSHED HIM DOWN THE TOILET,

37:25.333 --> 37:27.167
BACK TO THE SEA.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.367
OKAY.

37:34.067 --> 37:37.067
(whispers) BACK TO THE SEA
IS BETTER THAN YOUR CUBBY.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.100
***

37:46.500 --> 37:49.200
(Derek) YOU OKAY?

37:49.233 --> 37:52.533
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
ONE MORE NIGHT IN THAT HOTEL.

37:52.567 --> 37:55.567
***

37:57.467 --> 38:00.167
HMM.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.133
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

38:02.167 --> 38:04.567
I HAVE TO START DATING.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.400
***

38:07.433 --> 38:10.333
IT ISN'T JUST SURGEONS.

38:10.367 --> 38:12.500
***

38:12.533 --> 38:14.433
THE TRUTH IS,
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE

38:14.467 --> 38:16.500
WHO ISN'T HAUNTED
BY SOMETHING...

38:18.367 --> 38:20.800
OR SOMEONE.

38:20.833 --> 38:24.000
***

38:27.233 --> 38:30.567
AND WHETHER WE TRY TO SLICE
THE PAIN AWAY WITH A SCALPEL

38:30.600 --> 38:33.467
OR SHOVE IT
IN THE BACK OF A CLOSET,

38:33.500 --> 38:36.300
OUR EFFORTS USUALLY FAIL.

38:36.333 --> 38:39.533
***

38:41.200 --> 38:43.233
WE MADE IT THROUGH
THIS DAY.

38:43.267 --> 38:47.033
YEAH, WE DID.

38:47.067 --> 38:49.733
WE MADE IT THROUGH
THIS DAY.

38:49.767 --> 38:52.767
***

39:01.200 --> 39:03.533
SO THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN CLEAR OUT THE COBWEBS

39:03.567 --> 39:05.533
IS TO TURN A NEW PAGE...

39:05.567 --> 39:09.033
UH, SO IT'S THE KITCHEN,
UH, BEDROOM, BATHROOM.

39:09.067 --> 39:11.667
THERE'S THE SOFA.
YOU CAN SLEEP HERE.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.667
GREAT.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.067
SO, UH...

39:15.100 --> 39:17.533
DO YOU MIND IF I
CLEAN UP A LITTLE?

39:17.567 --> 39:18.533
YES.

39:18.567 --> 39:21.067
I MIND A LOT.

39:21.100 --> 39:24.433
***

39:24.467 --> 39:28.367
OR PUT AN OLD STORY
TO REST...

39:28.400 --> 39:31.400
***

39:37.167 --> 39:39.667
(sighs)

39:41.867 --> 39:43.633
GREY.

39:43.667 --> 39:46.433
CHIEF.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GREY?
THIS IS A STERILE ENVIRONMENT.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.300
IT'S MY MOTHER.

39:52.333 --> 39:56.700
AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE
SHE'D WANT TO BE.

39:56.733 --> 40:00.767
***

40:15.633 --> 40:18.500
***

40:18.533 --> 40:20.267
SHOULD WE SAY A PRAYER?

40:20.300 --> 40:23.767
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.267
FINALLY,
FINALLY TO REST.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.800
ASHES TO ASHES.

40:31.467 --> 40:33.633
DUST TO DUST.

40:33.667 --> 40:37.400
***
