WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.879
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:20.324
Uh, it's a couple
more doors down.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.109
That's okay.
We can walk.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.857
That dinner was amazing.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.772
Thank you.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.513
Dessert was my favorite.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.824
You wouldn't take it back.
- Are you kidding?

00:41.824 --> 00:43.347
I love you.

00:43.347 --> 00:46.263
And you asked my dad
for his permission.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.700
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.615
I was so nervous.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.530
But he said
you make her so happy.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.619
Just make sure
you take care of her.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.057
You do, baby.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.800
I can't wait to spend the
rest of my life with you.

01:16.685 --> 01:17.773
Calvin?

01:17.773 --> 01:18.774
Cal!

01:18.774 --> 01:19.992
Calvin!

01:19.992 --> 01:20.993
Baby.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.778
Cal!

01:22.778 --> 01:24.736
Wake up, Cal.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.739
Calvin!

01:27.739 --> 01:29.785
Calvin.
Calvin--

01:29.785 --> 01:31.395
No! No--

01:31.395 --> 01:33.658
- Come on!
- No! Let me go!

01:33.658 --> 01:35.225
Cal! Let me go!

01:35.225 --> 01:36.922
Get in there!

01:36.922 --> 01:38.185
No!

01:38.185 --> 01:40.100
Calvin!
- Go, go!

01:47.542 --> 01:49.935
You want the good news
first or the bad news?

01:49.935 --> 01:51.154
Oh, there's good news?

01:51.154 --> 01:52.721
A witness
from across the street

01:52.721 --> 01:54.375
gave us a partial
description of our shooter,

01:54.375 --> 01:57.029
not a physical description,
but a patch on a vest.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.118
Cursed Crew.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.510
The motorcycle club.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.772
That's why we were called.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.339
Yeah.
Ongoing criminal organization

02:02.339 --> 02:04.776
that traffics guns and drugs.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.256
Fits our agenda.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.823
I just don't think we
have time for this case.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.086
Six 9 mil,
full metal jacket casings.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.783
They really unloaded
on this guy.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.046
And this belonged to
the missing female.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.787
And this is the bad news.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.441
Van pulls up
after the shooting.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.791
Two men hop out, kidnap her.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.576
Janelle Carver.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.752
They were just coming
home from dinner.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.929
You okay?
What's up?

02:26.929 --> 02:28.887
- Has the family been notified?
- No.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.193
I'll reach out to homicide.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.979
No, I'll, uh...
let me handle it.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.349
Okay. You ready?

03:07.404 --> 03:09.667
Somebody's outside.

03:12.757 --> 03:13.932
Go, go.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.197
You're in the wrong place, brother.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.981
What do you want?
Why are you here?

03:18.981 --> 03:20.417
- Get outta here, man!
- I need to talk to David.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.636
There ain't no David here.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.029
Hey!
What the hell's going on?

03:24.029 --> 03:26.771
David.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.034
Elliot?

03:29.034 --> 03:30.819
You know this guy?

03:32.908 --> 03:34.649
Yeah.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.870
We served together.
Now he's a cop.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.481
What are you doing here?

03:40.481 --> 03:43.179
We need to talk.

03:43.179 --> 03:46.356
I don't see you
for, what, 25 years.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.229
Now you wanna talk to me?
What is this?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.101
Somewhere in private.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.847
We're just starting to piece
together the details.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.805
- What do you know?
- Not much.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.894
But we've got a witness
who gave us a lead.

04:02.894 --> 04:06.246
Mentioned something about
members of a motorcycle club.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.030
The Cursed Crew
has got my daughter?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.684
We're just starting
the investigation.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.251
Yeah, well, don't bother.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.556
I'll take care of it.
- Now, David--

04:12.556 --> 04:14.297
They kidnapped my daughter

04:14.297 --> 04:16.168
and they gunned down
her fiancé.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.953
If you're looking to get
into a war with a rival gang,

04:17.953 --> 04:19.520
then no one is safe.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.087
Now, I can make this a
priority with my task force,

04:22.087 --> 04:25.830
but I need a little information
from you so that I can help.

04:25.830 --> 04:30.966
You want me to
help you... again.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.403
I'm doing my job.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.666
But you're a fellow Marine.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.233
That counts for something.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.887
You haven't changed.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.890
Always trying to
save the world.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.981
That's what almost
got you killed in Kuwait.

04:47.199 --> 04:50.072
Good initiative, bad judgment.
Right, Marine?

04:50.072 --> 04:52.770
I just wanna make sure
that no one else gets hurt,

04:52.770 --> 04:54.381
including you.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.602
- That sounds like a threat.
- It's not.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.735
If it were my daughter,
I'd feel the exact same way.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.997
Trust me.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.912
But if things go south here,

05:03.912 --> 05:06.001
you'll be the first person
I lock up.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.047
Well, thanks for
the heads up.

05:10.397 --> 05:14.314
You do it your way,
I'll do it my way.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.287
Our kidnap victim,
Janelle Carver,

06:15.287 --> 06:17.681
is the daughter
of David Carver,

06:17.681 --> 06:19.857
president of the Sons of Sin
Motorcycle Club.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.556
Witness at the scene
identified the men who took her

06:22.556 --> 06:24.340
as wearing these.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.344
Kidnapping the daughter
of a rival club's president

06:28.344 --> 06:30.912
after murdering her fiancé?
Wow.

06:30.912 --> 06:36.091
They're trying to take us
out for good this time,

06:36.091 --> 06:38.485
so we show them no mercy.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.443
Where do you wanna start?

06:40.443 --> 06:42.532
It's about where
we're gonna finish.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.968
We know what motivated this?

06:43.968 --> 06:45.535
Peter Grimes,
our main suspect,

06:45.535 --> 06:47.842
president of the Cursed Crew.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.670
If you want something
that'll keep you up at night,

06:49.670 --> 06:51.498
try reading his rap sheet
like I did.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.064
And now under his leadership,

06:53.064 --> 06:55.545
the crew has forged
strong ties with the cartels.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.286
They run dope up from Mexico.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.940
Who operates out of Bayside?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.898
Well, normally,
right now they're laying low.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.683
<i>They know we'll be
out looking for them</i>

07:02.683 --> 07:04.728
so we turn over every rock

07:04.728 --> 07:06.817
until we find
one of those roaches.

07:06.817 --> 07:09.298
Then we take 'em out, right?

07:09.298 --> 07:10.821
An eye for an eye.

07:10.821 --> 07:13.128
<i>We don't have enough
for a warrant yet.</i>

07:13.128 --> 07:14.434
And if we bust into
the clubhouse

07:14.434 --> 07:15.913
and Janelle's not there,

07:15.913 --> 07:17.524
we might not ever
be able to find her.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.264
You and Carver--
what's the connection?

07:19.264 --> 07:20.788
We served together.

07:20.788 --> 07:23.921
This cop Stabler,
you and him go way back, huh?

07:23.921 --> 07:27.055
I was his platoon leader
in the Corps.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.926
He's not gonna
be a problem, is he?

07:28.926 --> 07:31.973
<i>Could Carver be
a problem for us?</i>

07:31.973 --> 07:34.758
He's got multiple assault
and weapons charges.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.760
Can we really trust him
to help out?

07:38.066 --> 07:40.285
Once upon a time,
I trusted him with my life.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.505
So let's get to work.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.471
Elliot, my office.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.741
That was a great debriefing.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.657
Now what's the real one?

08:05.441 --> 08:09.227
Look, we just went through
this with Jennings.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.186
Friend to friend.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.453
January '91,
company was deployed

08:17.453 --> 08:20.325
to Ahmad
al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.111
Desert Shield
had turned into Desert Storm.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.770
Call it a firefight.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.556
I was pinned down, out of ammo,

08:33.556 --> 08:36.559
and Carver broke ranks and...

08:39.214 --> 08:40.868
Saved my life.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.219
So you feel like you owe him.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.223
I guess.

08:52.053 --> 08:55.143
Just looked through a list
of unknowns for Cursed Crew.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.580
Think I may have found
someone that can help us.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.241
Carver's out looking for us.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.330
Yeah. I heard that, too.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.201
You chamber a round.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.639
Nobody we don't know
makes it through that door.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.249
You got it.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.085
You awake?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.961
It'll all be over soon. Relax.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.311
My father's gonna kill you.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.009
You know that, right?

09:37.054 --> 09:40.144
It's not like
he hasn't tried before.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.581
You--

09:42.799 --> 09:45.715
Why am I here?

09:45.715 --> 09:47.587
Why did you kill him?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.153
Why?

09:49.153 --> 09:51.678
Your father
has something that I want.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.202
And now I have
something that he wants.

09:54.202 --> 09:57.248
If he decides to work with me,
you are free.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.817
But if he doesn't...

10:09.260 --> 10:11.045
I'm hungry.

10:13.482 --> 10:14.962
Mac is here.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.965
Get her a sandwich
or something.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.017
Where the hell have you been?
- Sorry.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.497
I was keeping the limit
in case--

10:28.497 --> 10:30.238
I need you to ride up
to Washington Heights.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.501
Tell Marco
we are back in business

10:32.501 --> 10:34.938
and to get the dope ready.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.592
I should have what
he's asking for soon.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.550
Carver already agreed?

10:38.550 --> 10:41.728
Not yet, but he will.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.869
I don't know
what to tell you guys.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.132
I'm just a prospect
for Cursed Crew.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.395
Until I'm patched in,
I'm no good to you.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.617
So... we done?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.140
I don't know.
Are we done, man?

11:03.140 --> 11:05.316
He's just a prospect.
- Will you chill out?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.538
What kind of
errands did you do?

11:09.538 --> 11:10.757
You restock the bar?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.715
Made runs for him, you know?

11:12.715 --> 11:14.325
What kinda runs?

11:14.325 --> 11:16.110
Pick up packages,
that kinda stuff.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.416
What was in the packages?

11:18.416 --> 11:20.288
You're making me
uncomfortable now.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.594
You're uncomfortable now?

11:22.594 --> 11:25.685
You pleaded no contest
to stealing license plates,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.730
and now you're
uncomfortable, kid?

11:27.730 --> 11:31.299
You have no idea how in over
your head you are right now.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.517
What are you saying?

11:32.517 --> 11:33.954
He's saying you're
a prospect in a crew

11:33.954 --> 11:35.390
that's being investigated
for a murder-kidnapping.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.349
A DMV charge
I can make go away.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.395
That's easy.
But conspiracy to murder,

11:40.395 --> 11:42.832
which makes you an
accessory to murder--

11:42.832 --> 11:44.704
I wasn't a part
of any murder.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.183
Hey, look, prospect or not,

11:46.183 --> 11:48.359
you're part of the club, right?

11:48.359 --> 11:51.798
Do you really wanna leave
that in the hands of the DA?

11:55.410 --> 11:56.977
Now you get it?

11:58.326 --> 11:59.588
What do you want?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.024
Just an address.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.373
Cursed Crew's
gotta have a safe house,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.071
a place where they do business.
Where is it?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.029
I can't rat out my crew.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.292
Then you're looking
at accessory to murder.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.428
So I'd rethink that answer.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.311
Do it.

12:40.803 --> 12:41.978
Uhh--

12:43.153 --> 12:45.112
Let's get outta here.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.950
Hey there.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.561
How you feelin'?

12:59.561 --> 13:01.171
You don't wanna do this.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.303
Do what?

13:04.305 --> 13:06.046
This?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.353
I don't know where she is.
I swear.

13:09.353 --> 13:12.226
You bastards
kidnapped my daughter,

13:12.226 --> 13:14.097
and you want me to believe

13:14.097 --> 13:15.882
you don't know
where she is right now?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.057
I don't. I swear.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.972
You're lying!

13:18.972 --> 13:20.277
They'll kill her.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.845
Grimes is crazy.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.848
You can't do this
or she's dead, please.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.546
They already
killed her fiancé.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.200
Just let me do it.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.129
Listen, son.

13:46.129 --> 13:49.393
I don't want this
to happen to you.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.917
I don't.

13:52.222 --> 13:57.358
You see, I've seen
innocent people die in war,

13:57.358 --> 14:01.536
and it's...
it's truly a tragedy.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.932
Sometimes...

14:05.932 --> 14:09.022
it has to happen...

14:09.022 --> 14:11.546
so the bigger mission
can be achieved.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.856
Now if you do know something,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.075
I'll let you live.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.904
I'm not an evil man.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.124
I just want my daughter back.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.300
Just tell me...

14:27.997 --> 14:29.477
Where is she?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.873
Where is she?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.447
This the spot?

14:43.447 --> 14:45.406
I think your boy mighta
been playing us.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.843
He didn't say it was
gonna be an actual house.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.932
Yeah. But where you gonna
keep Janelle around here?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.673
Seriously.

14:51.673 --> 14:55.329
Grab the slim jim.
Try the other door.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.991
Here.

15:23.487 --> 15:24.836
Mm-hmm.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.055
That's some
serious firepower.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.362
And a drop van.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.972
I guess the Cursed Crew
doesn't deliver.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.713
They expect their customers

15:31.713 --> 15:33.541
to pick up their merchandise.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.035
Police!
Show us your hands.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.471
NYPD!
- Whoa, whoa!

15:50.471 --> 15:51.994
Hold on, hold on!

15:51.994 --> 15:53.169
We're ATF.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.518
Show us badges.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.303
You first.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.003
Holster your guns.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.749
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

16:12.623 --> 16:14.756
We've had five federal agents
shot in the last six months

16:14.756 --> 16:15.626
by 3D printed guns.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.454
We traced the Los Toros cartel.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.065
This is a Cursed Crew drop,

16:19.065 --> 16:21.415
but these AKs
aren't what we're lookin' for.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.026
Los Toros gets the guns
from a supplier in the U.S.,

16:24.026 --> 16:25.854
which we traced
to the Cursed Crew.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.247
We got intel the exchange
was happening here,

16:27.247 --> 16:29.031
but it was supposed
to be two days ago.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.164
Kept staking out the place,
hoping they change the time.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.600
Then you guys pulled up.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.862
We're chasing down
a kidnapping.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.124
Thought she might be here.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.996
- Cursed Crew did a kidnapping?
- Yeah.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.954
The head of a rival
gang's daughter.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.912
Biker gangs don't usually
do kidnappings.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.002
It's a cartel's M.O.
- Yeah.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.225
Maybe Janelle's kidnapping
is tied to the guns.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.619
Okay.
How?

16:55.971 --> 16:59.105
Are you selling guns
to Grimes?

16:59.105 --> 17:01.020
Who told you that?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.370
Well, something had to
have happened for Grimes

17:03.370 --> 17:04.980
to take Janelle like that.

17:07.330 --> 17:10.507
Just tell me the truth
so I can finally help you.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.814
All you gotta do
is be honest with me.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.515
Come with me.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.870
Grimes offered me
a ton of money.

17:25.870 --> 17:29.048
200 guns he knew I could get.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.399
I actually thought
it'd be good business,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.183
working with a rival club.

17:34.183 --> 17:37.186
Then I found out he was selling
'em back to the cartel.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.883
Los Toros.

17:38.883 --> 17:42.191
So what happened?
He wanted more money?

17:42.974 --> 17:45.194
Los Toros keeps
a hit list of federal agents

17:45.194 --> 17:47.109
they wanna take out.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.329
One of those guys
used to be Marines.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.418
I couldn't be a part of that.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.421
Guess I'm getting soft
in my old age.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.467
I could throw a rock

17:57.467 --> 17:59.208
anywhere in the tri-state area

17:59.208 --> 18:02.559
and hit about a dozen
black market gun suppliers.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.518
What makes your
supplier so special

18:04.518 --> 18:06.085
that Grimes would kidnap
your daughter

18:06.085 --> 18:08.043
to ensure
that the deal goes down?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.830
Look, you're already looking
at five felonies.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.050
Another one's
not gonna change my mind.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.228
He's not a supplier.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.664
What do you mean,
he's not a supplier?

18:20.664 --> 18:21.796
What does that mean?

18:21.796 --> 18:23.667
He's a gun maker.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.062
Ever see a 3D printed
ghost gun like that?

18:27.062 --> 18:28.107
No.

18:29.586 --> 18:32.372
Who is he?
- That's the problem.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.983
We've never met face to face,

18:34.983 --> 18:37.638
just through dark web contacts.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.075
Guy's a total ghost himself.

18:40.771 --> 18:45.080
Otherwise I'd give Grimes his
guns, get my daughter back.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.995
Sarge, I need you
and Jet to give me a hand

18:46.995 --> 18:48.866
in tracking someone down.

18:53.001 --> 18:56.047
Whoever made this,
the guy's a Rembrandt.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.614
Rembrandt was a painter.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.616
You mean Michelangelo,
the sculptor.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.315
Of course.
That's dumb.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.968
Well, we're trying to
track down who made it.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.796
What can you tell us?

19:05.796 --> 19:08.799
What you're seeing here
is a top shelf

19:08.799 --> 19:11.541
3D fused filament fabrication

19:11.541 --> 19:15.154
of an illegal weapon using
unique encrypted blueprints.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
And where does one
get blueprints

19:16.807 --> 19:18.157
for something like this?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
Underground markets
on the dark web. Right?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.378
Makes it almost
impossible to trace a gun

19:22.378 --> 19:24.032
back to its original coder.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.947
So our builder could be
a kid in his mom's garage

19:25.947 --> 19:27.470
with a 3D printer.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.604
It'd be a bit more of
a sophisticated operation.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.737
See, typically, a plastic gun

19:33.737 --> 19:35.304
has an extremely short
shelf life.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.698
They break under the force
of a bullet being fired.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.309
But whoever made this--

19:40.309 --> 19:41.702
Found a way around that

19:41.702 --> 19:43.704
because of the strength
of its unique geometry.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.010
Which makes him Michelangelo.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.708
Means they're a genius,

19:47.708 --> 19:49.579
like way above
your average criminal.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.191
If he's that good, he might
want credit for his work.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.324
Can we check social media,
online forums,

19:55.324 --> 19:56.673
something like that?

19:56.673 --> 19:58.197
If they were dumb enough
to advertise, sure,

19:58.197 --> 20:00.503
but we don't
have that kind of time.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.984
You could try to find out
who supplied the gun's polymer.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.986
Because that's unique?

20:04.986 --> 20:07.554
Then we match any sales
records to 3D printers

20:07.554 --> 20:09.077
sold in the tri-state.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.384
If our coder's quota went up
after making a deal,

20:11.384 --> 20:12.863
and we get lucky?

20:12.863 --> 20:15.910
I would love it
if we got lucky--

20:17.912 --> 20:20.262
Because I mean--
- Okay, Bruce.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.003
Thank you for your help.
- Yeah.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.527
All right.
Any... time.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.920
Bye.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.665
Okay. So tracking polymer

20:31.665 --> 20:33.449
and 3D printer sales
sounds good,

20:33.449 --> 20:35.364
but where do we start?

20:44.330 --> 20:45.331
Hey.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.202
Go up to my desk.
I need your help.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.508
Okay.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.379
Reyes and I are at the helm.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.991
Okay. Press the spacebar
on the far right keyboard.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.255
Done.
It's asking for your password.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.260
Take me off speaker.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.175
Okay.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.703
Are you for real?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.139
Just do it.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.015
<i>- You're back on speaker.</i>
- Good.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.930
Reyes, type in the
following search code.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.758
- Why can't I?
- Because I'm not sure

21:21.758 --> 21:23.673
you have opposable thumbs. Reyes.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.893
Yeah.
Yep, yep, yep.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.590
Go for Reyes.

21:27.590 --> 21:31.377
<i>Star, star,
dollar sign, asterisk,</i>

21:31.377 --> 21:34.858
asterisk, dot, ampersand.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.382
Uh... whoa.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.558
What did I just hack into?
This doesn't look good?

21:38.558 --> 21:41.300
Relax. Feds look at us,
and I look at them.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.607
In the search box,
enter 3D gun printer sales.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.783
<i>You should see a submenu
with merchant codes</i>

21:46.783 --> 21:48.089
<i>and delivery points.</i>

21:48.089 --> 21:50.439
I only care about big sales
in the tri-state.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.919
<i>You're good.</i>

21:51.919 --> 21:55.009
150 3D printers were shipped
to an address in Queens

21:55.009 --> 21:56.445
<i>last fall.
You got a pen?</i>

21:56.445 --> 21:57.838
No. I got a brain.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.493
And Whelan,
if you repeat my password

22:00.493 --> 22:02.712
to literally anyone,
I will haunt you.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.030
You sure this is the place?

22:16.030 --> 22:18.380
It's the address
on the order form.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.301
And those are ghost guns.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.346
Don't move.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.698
Yeah, I'd run too
if I built a gun

23:15.698 --> 23:17.004
used in a capital murder.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.485
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Right.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.400
Because most people
who have done nothing wrong

23:21.400 --> 23:23.097
run from police.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.839
You're police?

23:25.839 --> 23:28.407
You're the expert.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.366
This look real to you?

23:44.335 --> 23:44.858
<i>...</i>

23:44.858 --> 23:47.861
Julius, there's a lotta
people looking for you.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.733
I can see why you would hide.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.997
Making guns for criminals
is dangerous work.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.696
I don't make guns.
I make art pieces.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.263
What they do with them
is none of my business.

23:59.263 --> 24:03.485
Well, we counted 200
of your little art pieces

24:03.485 --> 24:06.575
in your shop in New York State

24:06.575 --> 24:08.795
where we consider them guns.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.928
That's 12 years minimum

24:11.928 --> 24:14.975
unless
you want to give us a hand.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.847
Hand with what?

24:21.634 --> 24:23.853
Read and sign this

24:23.853 --> 24:26.639
if you're willing to cooperate.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.126
Phase one complete.
Now you're up.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.568
We found your gun maker
and we the guns.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.222
Yeah. And?

24:45.222 --> 24:46.876
Now we deal for Janelle.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.226
I need you to call Grimes,
tell him you're ready to trade,

24:49.226 --> 24:51.315
and I'll take it from there.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.753
So I'm working with NYPD now?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.582
In exchange for leniency. Yeah.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.803
So I get my daughter back

25:00.803 --> 25:02.849
and still go to jail.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.505
Yeah.

25:12.685 --> 25:16.471
You know, I thought
about getting out,

25:16.471 --> 25:20.388
the club, the life.

25:21.084 --> 25:24.087
When Janelle told me she
was serious with a guy,

25:24.087 --> 25:27.743
she could see them
having kids,

25:27.743 --> 25:31.573
I thought, what's my grandkid
gonna think of me?

25:31.573 --> 25:34.228
What kind of example
would I be setting?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.801
It's just who I am.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.326
Well, it's not who I see.

25:45.979 --> 25:49.243
You never were
a good judge of character.

25:50.984 --> 25:54.770
Between nature and nurture,

25:54.770 --> 25:56.424
nature always wins.

25:56.424 --> 25:58.557
I don't see it that way.

25:59.427 --> 26:04.084
You just have to want to
never give up the fight.

26:06.390 --> 26:10.917
Maybe if you did,
you'd be a lot happier.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.798
Los Toros.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.584
Here?

26:31.633 --> 26:33.243
Should we gear up?

26:33.243 --> 26:34.723
No.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.334
I got good news this time.

26:42.644 --> 26:45.691
Marco, mi hermano,

26:45.691 --> 26:47.910
you never answered my calls.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.608
Where are my guns?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.740
I just gotta pick 'em up.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.786
And what about my interest?

26:54.961 --> 26:57.441
200 guns was three days ago.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.139
You made me wait.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.750
Delay wasn't my fault.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.622
You think I care?

27:03.622 --> 27:07.190
You make it right, now,

27:07.190 --> 27:09.628
or the next visit
won't be so friendly.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.196
Hermano.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.939
So we'll bring
you more guns.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.246
All the guns you could
ever need.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.640
How you gonna do that?

27:22.336 --> 27:25.121
I don't ask you how you
do your business, do I?

27:26.601 --> 27:28.342
You trying to screw me?

27:30.213 --> 27:32.651
I mean, Marco,

27:32.651 --> 27:34.565
if I wanted to,

27:34.565 --> 27:37.394
you wouldn't see me coming.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.053
I'll be in touch.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.896
Find a new chair, friend.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.985
Carver's not coming.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.597
Coming for what?

28:06.597 --> 28:08.556
I'm here on his behalf.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.864
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:11.864 --> 28:14.518
Carver
doesn't trust you either,

28:14.518 --> 28:16.869
so that's why I'm here,

28:16.869 --> 28:18.827
for his daughter,

28:18.827 --> 28:21.047
with 200 guns,
here to make the deal.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.833
Well, that's not
the deal anymore.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.489
You're gonna give me my guns

28:28.489 --> 28:31.100
and then you're gonna
bring me the gun maker.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.408
I've never met the guy.
I can't do that.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.193
Of course you can.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.894
Put her on.

28:51.860 --> 28:56.822
<i>Please, please,
please, please, please.</i>

28:58.824 --> 29:01.217
Give me what I want,

29:01.217 --> 29:04.438
or you can sit there
and watch her die.

29:07.136 --> 29:10.270
Or maybe you can die.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.364
Grimes doesn't
just want the guns.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.844
He wants Julius, too.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.846
- We can't give him that.
- Well, if we want Janelle,

29:20.846 --> 29:23.065
we have to at the very least
set up the exchange.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.328
There's no way Julius
is gonna go for that.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.330
Who says it has to be Julius?

29:27.330 --> 29:30.551
I mean, this guy made sure his
buyers didn't know who he was.

29:30.551 --> 29:33.032
Let's use that.
I go in as Julius.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.685
It's one variable we control.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.776
Can we get confirmation that
Grimes has never met this guy?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.865
Well, if we let
that hit the street,

29:39.865 --> 29:42.389
it might blow things up.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.608
Okay.
So you go in as Julius.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.393
He knows you're not Julius.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.047
I'm taking a risk.
I get that.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.484
But I'd do it for you
if that works right now.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.007
No. I don't like it,

29:52.007 --> 29:54.357
Especially when we're handing
over untraceable weapons.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.576
This is Grimes.

29:55.576 --> 29:56.838
I mean, he's not gonna
hand over Janelle

29:56.838 --> 29:58.231
unless he sees what
he asks for.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.667
And they do exist right now.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.887
We are not bringing
200 working ghost guns

30:01.887 --> 30:03.410
to a hostage deal.

30:03.410 --> 30:04.933
They're 3D printed guns.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.892
If we can make it
so they can't be traced,

30:06.892 --> 30:09.459
we can make it
so they can't be fired.

30:13.768 --> 30:14.813
Hey.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.078
Uh, hey, Jet.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.862
You do any coding?

30:20.862 --> 30:24.170
Uh, sure,
but I'm kind of bad.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.475
Perfect.

30:25.475 --> 30:28.217
Bad coder is just what I need.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.045
Remember the only
thing to alter

30:30.045 --> 30:32.831
is to make sure these new
guns can't fire a live round.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.963
They still gotta
look exactly the same.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.095
Yep.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.358
I'm neutralizing the fire pin.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.577
Any way you can
fuse it to the bolt?

30:42.492 --> 30:46.975
That's smart.

30:50.196 --> 30:53.895
That should do it I think.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.855
Let's load it in the
printer, have a look.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.717
Not bad at all, Bruce.

31:46.382 --> 31:50.169
- You two set?
- Ready.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.997
We're set down here.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.260
Let's just remember not to
move in until we got Janelle.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.609
All right?

31:59.613 --> 32:01.223
Service
in Bridge Plaza sucks.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.746
Give me a sec.
I'll fix it.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.444
Which camera isn't working?

32:04.444 --> 32:07.142
The money shot.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.884
Reyes, you good?
We don't have eyes on the meet.

32:09.884 --> 32:12.017
Copy that.
No worries.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.454
I got a clear line
of sight of the drop.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.572
Shame it had to come to this.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.835
Everything's gonna
be all right, sweetheart.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.793
- Dad, I--
- Wait.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.840
Where are my guns?

33:07.855 --> 33:09.422
You must be my gunman.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.815
Julius Hayes.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.817
I trust there was
no issues with my order.

33:13.817 --> 33:18.692
200 pristine, nontraceable
3D polymer 9 millimeters.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.000
Show them to me.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.872
You got it.

33:35.622 --> 33:38.146
All right.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.500
So far so good over here.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.026
All right.
You got what you came for.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.940
Let's wrap this thing up.
- Why?

33:49.940 --> 33:52.117
You got someplace
you gotta be?

34:00.255 --> 34:01.822
What are you doing?

34:15.227 --> 34:17.707
Hey, guys.
We got a bogey SUV rolling in.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.187
Stay in cover.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.233
Nobody moves until
we know what's happening.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.931
Who the hell is this?

34:29.893 --> 34:33.114
You know, I realized
something, Grimes.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.551
What do I need you for
if I got him?

34:37.901 --> 34:40.165
Tell your guys to put
the crates in my vehicle.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.296
Now.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.046
You little bitch.

34:52.046 --> 34:54.701
Yeah.
What are you gonna do about it?

34:57.399 --> 35:00.098
Okay. Hey, guys.
Go ahead.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.890
Janelle! Janelle!

35:40.616 --> 35:42.444
No!

35:42.444 --> 35:43.445
Enough.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.055
Shut up.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.843
Reyes, he's headed
toward the southwest gate.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.061
<i>Copy.</i>

35:55.283 --> 35:56.980
Go, go, go, go, go.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.373
Don't lose him.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.164
Ah!

36:07.077 --> 36:08.601
Left, left, left--

36:16.174 --> 36:17.523
Son of a bitch.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.745
Come on.
Get outta the way.

36:22.745 --> 36:23.920
Get outta the way!

36:23.920 --> 36:25.661
Hey, where you going--

36:28.011 --> 36:29.187
He's doubling back.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.189
Yep.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.022
No!

36:39.022 --> 36:40.198
Let's go.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.070
- No!
- Come on!

36:43.070 --> 36:44.376
Aah!

36:54.299 --> 36:57.215
You all right?
You okay?

37:08.356 --> 37:10.880
David!
David, don't do it!

37:10.880 --> 37:13.840
That gets you nothing.
There's no need, David.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.190
David!

37:16.190 --> 37:18.105
We've won. Hey!

37:18.105 --> 37:20.977
Listen to me.
We've won.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.849
Janelle is safe.
We've got him.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.898
And you know what the
right thing to do is.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.642
You know what
the right thing is.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.302
Go on. Go on.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.870
Just back off.

38:02.149 --> 38:03.803
Take good care of her.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.109
I'll take you down to
the precinct for processing.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.547
Yeah. I get it.

38:08.547 --> 38:11.767
Look, time comes you
need a character witness,

38:11.767 --> 38:13.465
I'm there for you.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.468
I'm looking for
less time, not more.

38:19.384 --> 38:22.169
You saved her.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.911
We both did.

38:24.911 --> 38:26.608
We're even now.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.396
I'll check on
her for you, huh?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.659
Thanks, brother.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.415
I didn't call
because I knew you were

38:50.415 --> 38:52.242
gonna say you were fine.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.332
I am fine.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.943
Okay.
You're fine.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.684
Can I come in?

38:59.946 --> 39:01.295
Sure.

39:23.273 --> 39:26.364
We spent a lot of time together
when we both came back home.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.976
Then I went to the Academy, and...

39:29.976 --> 39:33.414
I didn't hear from him anymore.
- Hmm.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.242
I reached out,
but he wouldn't answer.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.722
And I would hear things,
you know,

39:36.722 --> 39:38.724
like he got pinched
for larceny or drugs.

39:38.724 --> 39:42.380
You know, it was always
small-time stuff, but...

39:44.425 --> 39:46.471
I knew where it was headed.

39:48.255 --> 39:52.433
And there was one night he was
in the drunk tank, bar fight.

39:52.433 --> 39:55.871
I'm a cop by now.

39:55.871 --> 40:01.486
And I said, David,
please let me help you.

40:01.486 --> 40:04.793
And he looked at me like I
had just spit in his face.

40:06.012 --> 40:08.928
He started yelling
and cursing at me,

40:08.928 --> 40:12.279
screaming you're not
my brother anymore.

40:12.279 --> 40:18.154
And I just said to him, look,

40:18.154 --> 40:20.809
my number won't be changing.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.290
But if your mind does,
you just--

40:23.290 --> 40:26.380
you call me, man.

40:26.380 --> 40:31.037
But that was the last time
we spoke.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.827
Well, it sounds like you
did the best you could do.

40:38.827 --> 40:42.352
You know what they
teach you in the Corps?

40:45.007 --> 40:48.141
Never leave a man behind.

40:48.141 --> 40:51.405
And his daughter is still
alive because you didn't.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.669
That counts for something.

40:58.238 --> 40:59.761
To brothers.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.939
To friends.

41:49.115 --> 41:49.507
<i>...</i>
