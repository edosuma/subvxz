00:06.607 --> 00:09.410
- Okay, so you should
check on Mr. Fritz,

00:10.478 --> 00:11.112
but he'll probably sleep
through the night.

00:11.879 --> 00:12.180
- Got it.
- Also, Alejandro in 402

00:12.813 --> 00:13.447
is requesting a sponge bath.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.184
- Yes, he said that he's

00:16.284 --> 00:17.351
"real, real dirty"

00:17.451 --> 00:19.453
and "only Jeff can help."

00:19.553 --> 00:21.522
- Alejandro,
stop falling in love with me.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.357
- Jeff, what do you think
about this?

00:23.457 --> 00:26.460
- Oh, God. Is that a man's head
on a pig's body?

00:26.560 --> 00:29.097
- Yeah. Bird Bones and I are
planning a retirement luau.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.399
So, Jeff, if you were
a straight man in your 60s

00:31.499 --> 00:33.301
with, like, not a whole lot
to look forward to,

00:33.401 --> 00:35.203
would you like this poster?

00:35.303 --> 00:37.037
- This is a fantasy
I am not willing to entertain.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.474
- I don't know.
Have you asked Dr. E out?

00:40.574 --> 00:42.143
No.
I'm not doing that today.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.278
- Yes, you have to.
It's my cancer wish.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.446
- That's not a thing.
- Come on.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.115
Before I got the big C,

00:47.215 --> 00:48.649
you guys were this close
to sucking face.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.152
- Okay, well, can you just
let me do it on my own time?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.553
- Okay.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.122
Paging Dr. Ericson.
Dr. Clive Ericson, please...

00:54.222 --> 00:56.056
Stop it.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.158
- Report to the front desk.
-  Emma, stop.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.359
Seriously, stop.
- Hello.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.295
- I did.
- Yes, she did.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.696
- My friend Maggie here...
- She wanted to

01:02.796 --> 01:04.132
tell you something.
- Has something that

01:04.232 --> 01:06.300
she would like to ask you.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.237
- Um, I did have--
yes, a question

01:09.337 --> 01:11.572
about the linens.
- No, not it.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.541
That's not it.
- I wanted to tell you,

01:13.641 --> 01:16.076
you're doing a wonderful job,
and I think that's great.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.611
- Okay, Maggie wants to ask--
- Thank you for your service.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.313
I swear to God.
- Ow! Ow!

01:19.413 --> 01:20.414
I will do it
if you don't do it! Ow!

01:20.514 --> 01:22.116
- Just get out of here.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.152
- That's in my armpit.
- Yes, it is.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.187
Rude.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.456
- Um, okay, yes.
Dr. Ericson,

01:28.556 --> 01:32.660
I actually wanted
to ask you if, um,

01:32.760 --> 01:34.495
in your professional opinion,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.730
you thought it would be
a good idea

01:36.830 --> 01:40.601
if, uh, we were
to go on a date.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.270
- Oh.
- Just, like, a snack.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.338
Or a hot air balloon or--

01:44.438 --> 01:45.606
Um, do you like horses?

01:45.706 --> 01:49.210
- Um, in my
professional opinion,

01:49.310 --> 01:52.613
I would say that, um--
that that would be a delight.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.348
- Oh.
- And, uh, yeah.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.683
- Great! You guys
should go to Chavo's!

01:55.783 --> 01:57.585
Do you like tacos?

01:59.387 --> 02:00.554
- No.
- No, but I'm gonna hear

02:00.654 --> 02:02.190
every dirty deet.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.424
- Get out of here.
Get out of here!

02:03.524 --> 02:06.194
- So just keep it clean--
or don't.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.128
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.231
- Um, I--
There's a patient who's--

02:10.331 --> 02:11.365
- Yeah, we got
a hospital to run.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.700
- Yeah.
- Or you do.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.701
- Patient's--
- I'm just learning.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.269
- Yeah.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.510
[Say Hi's "Back Before
We Were Brittle"]

02:22.610 --> 02:25.446
- * Hey, remember when

02:25.546 --> 02:28.516
* All of time stood still

02:28.616 --> 02:32.720
- * Ooh
- * Do do do do

02:32.820 --> 02:36.657
* Back before we were brittle

02:36.757 --> 02:40.194
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:41.262 --> 02:43.531
- Okay, I feel like
the air vent is good here.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.499
But I don't know; maybe he'd
rather sit by the window.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.335
- It doesn't matter
where he sits

02:47.435 --> 02:49.237
because you guys are obsessed
with each other.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.804
- Well, I just
don't want this to be one

02:50.904 --> 02:52.506
of my straight clunker dates,
you know what I mean?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.442
Classic Maggie,
clunking it up.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.543
- You can't go wrong
with Chavo's.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.245
I come here all the time.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.546
Talking tableside guac!

02:58.646 --> 03:01.249
- I thought I heard
the guac squawk.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.684
- Mi hermano, Jorge!

03:03.784 --> 03:05.486
All right, good to see you.
Huh!

03:05.586 --> 03:06.754
both: Guac.
- There it is.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.489
- Oh!
- This is George, guys.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.458
He is the maker of the guac.
A true craftsman.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.792
- Oh, come on.
Guilty as charged.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.729
You know what?

03:15.829 --> 03:17.231
- I'll be back
with the good avocados.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.566
- Okay.
- Oh, I love it.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.268
- Muchas gracias.
- Grachias.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.670
Oh, sorry, guys.
It's Tina.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.372
She's outside;
she just needs to tell me

03:24.472 --> 03:25.706
something about work,
so I'll be right back.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.308
- Well, just tell her
to come in.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.642
- No, that's okay.
I'll go outside.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.578
'Cause of...
- 'Cause of...

03:30.678 --> 03:33.381
Oh, what--
Why, 'cause of me?

03:33.481 --> 03:34.515
'Cause I'm here?
- No.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.216
- No, get her in here.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.451
- Get her in here.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.586
It's fine.
- Okay.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.288
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.455
- Hi, everybody.
- Oh, that was quick.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.656
- Hey, Teens.
- Hello.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.325
- Hi, Tina.
- Hello. Oh.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.759
- Here you go.
- So should I sit--

03:45.859 --> 03:47.595
- Sure, do you want--
- Or--would you like

03:47.695 --> 03:49.363
to sit next to your--
- Oh, uh, okay. Sure.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.631
Um, I'll just go--
Here, you go over here.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.400
- I'll just go
right in there.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.234
- Maggie, move over.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.536
- Maggie, just go over.
This'll be easier.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.405
Just do it.
- Come on and scooch in.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.239
- Keep going.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.808
- Yes, please. Just, Maggie,
please be helpful.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.276
Thank you.
- Scooch in.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.444
- All right.
- Hey.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.845
- Okay.
- There we go.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.848
- Everybody's sitting.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.717
- Well, I won't
be staying long.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.452
- Great, I'm gonna
have to move again.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.487
- I just wanted
to tell Emma in person

04:13.587 --> 04:17.491
that Daija Dubois fired her
party planner for her sweet 13

04:17.591 --> 04:19.693
and we have an interview
with her tomorrow.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.362
Oh, my God,
Tina, yes!

04:21.462 --> 04:22.863
They're like
the Connecticut Kardashians.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.632
- Good for you guys.
- Yeah.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.867
- Tina! It has been a while.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.802
- George!
- Would you two lovers

04:28.902 --> 04:30.270
like your usual,

04:30.371 --> 04:31.772
fajitas por dos?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.407
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, George.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.575
That's a--that's a no
on the fajeets.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.311
- No, let's shut it down,
my man.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.379
- Muchachos.
- Oh, no.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.513
- Anniversario.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.516
Enjoy the song of love.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.352
- No, gracias. No, gracias.
- No, no.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.519
- Yeah, no, grachias.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.687
- They're divorced.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.491
The one who looks like
Howard the Duck?

04:50.591 --> 04:51.592
- Jeff, that's not nice.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.361
- She can't help her face.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.362
Anyway, she fell off a boat.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.663
- Oh, that's terrible.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.465
- Yes, it is.
But also, it means

04:57.565 --> 04:58.666
she can't go
to Beyoncé tonight.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.868
Shut up.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.737
- Guess who's getting
in formation, bitch.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.374
- Work. And work.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.576
Get it. Oh, stop.
Stop getting it.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.345
- Sorry to interrupt
your little dance, Jeff.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.846
I need the blood work
for 507.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.683
- Um, I think it's actually
on the nurses' station.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.554
- It should be--I--
I'll be right back.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.822
- Okay. Thank you.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.325
- Hi.
- Actually, can I have a word

05:25.426 --> 05:26.894
with you too?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.396
- You may be.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.563
- Oh, okay.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.668
- Um...

05:34.768 --> 05:36.570
I don't know what
to wear for our date.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.407
- Oh, okay.
- You know, I phoned Chavost's.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.541
- Chavo's.
- Yeah, Chavo's.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.443
- Yes.
- And, um,

05:42.543 --> 05:43.677
they said
festive casual.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.745
I--
What does that mean?

05:44.845 --> 05:45.946
Is that tie

05:46.046 --> 05:47.715
- Definitely no tie.
- Right.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.383
Hawaiian shirt, maybe?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.718
- Uh, maybe just wear
whatever you would

05:50.818 --> 05:52.720
normally wear on a date.
- Okay.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.556
It's just, it's been a while.
- Yeah, me too.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.691
- I kind of want to get it
absolutely right.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.594
- Blood work
is on your desk, sir.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.895
Please don't fire me.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.864
- That won't be necessary, Jeff.
Thank you.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.766
And, uh, thank you
for raising those issues.

06:05.866 --> 06:10.538
I will make the necessary, uh,
adjustments to--to those.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.705
And thank--
Carry on.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.710
- You know what.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.579
- Shut up and make this bed.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.615
*

06:23.517 --> 06:24.885
Like, your guest house
that you live in?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.855
- Um, no, this is the
house house that I live in.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.623
- It's very small.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.025
I want to start now.
- Oh, absolutely.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.894
Should we wait
for your parents to come first?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.629
- You're gonna be waiting
a very long time.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.797
They're both in Dubai
right now.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.934
- I take care of myself.
Who takes care of you?

06:41.034 --> 06:44.805
- I don't know. I--
Is--

06:44.905 --> 06:47.508
- All right, Daija,
so for your sweet 13,

06:47.608 --> 06:49.877
we thought that a princess theme
might be cute.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.845
- Strike one.
Do you know how old I am?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.482
I have my own bodyguard
named Tony.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.784
- So don't come at me with cute.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.619
I want a "Game of Thrones"
theme.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.953
- Of course.
- So I want White Walkers.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.655
- Write this down.
- I want dragons.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.956
I want a real ice wall.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.758
I want a man
whose hand is missing.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.926
- Sorry to interrupt.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.728
The party's only
a few days away,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.530
so I don't know if we'll be able
to do all of that.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.532
- Then strike three.
You're out.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.601
What was strike two?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.435
- Your hairdo.
- Oh, hurtful.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.837
- Daija, please don't
strike us out.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.872
We can get you that man
without a hand.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.774
I will cut it off myself
if I have to.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.676
- Okay, Tina, Tina, Tina.
- Please let us do this. Please.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.813
- Tina, let's not beg.
Daija, honey, what do you say?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.548
Can we make those dreams
come true?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.983
- You fix that hairdo,
we got a deal.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.720
Tony!

07:32.820 --> 07:34.555
- We need a man
with one hand.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.624
- Oh, great.
Just great.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.825
Denise had
her stupid baby.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.860
- Oh, that's awesome.
Boy or girl?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.830
She was supposed
to cover my shift for tonight.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.732
Now I can't go to Beyoncé.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.534
When life gives you "Lemonade,"
it's not supposed

07:46.634 --> 07:48.502
to turn back into lemons.
- Oh.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.070
Well, why don't you
just leave early?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.805
- You want me
to ask Dr. Popsicle

07:51.905 --> 07:53.541
if I can leave
before my shift is over?

07:53.641 --> 07:55.075
- Yeah.
- No way. He hates me.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.578
He likes me.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.912
- Oh, there you are.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.113
We have some stitches
that need removing.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.582
I'd like you both
to assist me.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.752
Jeff has to get
to a Beyoncé concert,

08:04.852 --> 08:06.620
so I told him it was cool
if he left early.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.756
- No. I need you both
to assist me.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.691
- It's just stitches.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.560
I think we could probably
do it, right, you and me?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.497
Ooh!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.601
- I just want Jeff

08:20.701 --> 08:21.935
to be able to go
to his concert.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.871
- That's not your decision
to make, is it?

08:23.971 --> 08:26.674
- Okay, come on, man.
It's just Bey.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.008
- I am the chief resident
of this hospital.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.778
You are a student.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.145
Why did you just turn
into an ice man?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.847
I'm just trying
to help my friend.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.650
- And I just want you
to do your job.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.752
I expect better from you.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.627
You know what?
I'm gonna stay.

08:51.331 --> 08:51.431
.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.134
- Hand me that dumb throne.

08:55.335 --> 08:55.368
God, I--I have never been
frozen out like that.

08:55.803 --> 08:56.804
- I'm so sorry.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.572
- It was terrifying.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.574
All day long, we're just,
like, flirting...

09:01.308 --> 09:01.675
- Yeah.
- And talking about

09:02.175 --> 09:02.976
our date to come.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.712
And then, out of nowhere,
he's like,

09:04.812 --> 09:06.580
"I'm your boss.
I'm the chief resident."

09:06.680 --> 09:08.115
- Well, like, technically,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.117
isn't he your boss?
- Technically, yes.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.284
But that doesn't
give him the right

09:11.384 --> 09:12.820
to talk to me like that.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.287
- No.
- Hand me more tiny swords.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.089
- Why does someone
want to sit on a throne

09:16.189 --> 09:17.758
and get a bunch of swords
up their butt?

09:17.858 --> 09:20.127
- How can you plan
a "Game of Thrones" themed party

09:20.227 --> 09:22.262
if you've never seen
an episode?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.131
Watch "Game of Thrones."

09:24.231 --> 09:25.633
- No, no, no. No.
It's a bunch of dragons

09:25.733 --> 09:27.300
and people having sex
with their brothers.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.202
I'm not interested.
- We are screwed.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.304
I just got off the phone
with the animal trainer, Jerome.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.106
- Ugh, I love Jerome.
- I do too.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.042
- He said that direwolves
aren't real

09:35.142 --> 09:36.810
and real wolves
are too dangerous.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.811
- Mm.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.179
- Go for Tina.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.748
Oh, yes.
I called about the DJ.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.750
Uh-huh. How many hands
does he have?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.852
- Oh, I'll show you.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.186
Fast-forward.
- No, no, no.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.755
We don't have time
for this.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.222
You have, like, a million
tiny swords to glue.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.158
Get gluing. Get gluing.
- Fine.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.827
Pause. We'll just watch it
later tonight

09:53.927 --> 09:55.328
'cause I'm gonna
cancel my date

09:55.428 --> 09:57.264
and spend the rest
of my life alone.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.299
- Okay, are you really gonna
throw out the entire possibility

09:59.399 --> 10:02.169
of a relationship because
of one awkward interaction?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.104
- Well, I don't want to date
someone that could

10:04.204 --> 10:06.106
turn into a White Walker
at any moment.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.275
- Okay, I don't know what
that is, but I will say this.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.311
Could you have maybe been
just a tiny bit inappropriate?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.246
'Cause sometimes
you don't like to be wrong.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.115
- How about you tell him

10:15.215 --> 10:17.184
how he made you feel,
give him the opportunity

10:17.284 --> 10:19.286
to say sorry,
and then you guys can move on

10:19.386 --> 10:22.389
and have a million beautiful
British babies together?

10:22.489 --> 10:25.893
- Well, our Khal Drogo
just booked a Pantene commercial

10:25.993 --> 10:27.627
and he is pulling out!

10:27.728 --> 10:29.196
- Khal Drogo,
is he important?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.699
- Yeah, he's the horse lord
of the Dothraki.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.233
- I hate all the words
you just said.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.135
- Daija is going to fire us.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.671
And you and I are gonna be stuck
doing retirement luaus

10:37.771 --> 10:39.206
for the rest of our lives.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.208
What are we gonna do?
- Tina, calm down.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.143
I have an idea.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.713
No way.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.881
- Please, please be
my Calvin Dragon.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.817
- It's Khal Drogo.
- Whatever.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.952
- And I can't do it, because
I'm a pillar of the community.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.922
I can't run around like some
oversexed barbarian

10:55.022 --> 10:56.690
from the Middle Ages,
as much as I would

10:56.790 --> 10:58.692
like to do that.
- Okay, you'll be wearing a wig.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.728
- Does Tina have any idea
that you're asking this of me?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.732
All you need to do
is be shirtless,

11:04.832 --> 11:06.800
wear a ponytail,
and carve some meat for tweens.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.368
- Yeah.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.436
- Whatever you want.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.138
- Done.
- Great.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.706
- I'm gonna carve some meat.
- Okay.

11:12.806 --> 11:13.907
- You should've led with that.
- Okay.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.809
- Ho, ho. Shing!

11:19.379 --> 11:20.748
- It's Dothraki, baby.
- I'm not interested.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.249
- The language of love.
- No, no.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.416
Khaleesi.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.288
- * I'm a veteran authority,
better than the majority *

11:28.388 --> 11:30.758
- We've got Wildfire
Lime Jell-O,

11:30.858 --> 11:33.260
Khaleesi's Pieces,
Celery Starks.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.796
Oh, and of course,
our White Walkers for waiters.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.464
- Oh, God.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.233
Serving dragon breath's punch.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.936
- Color me impressed.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.239
- Honestly, I didn't
expect much from you.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.809
So you're not fired.
- Well, you can't fire us,

11:48.909 --> 11:50.377
'cause the event
is currently happening.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.012
- I can fire you at any time.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.480
You still haven't fixed
your hair.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.348
- Okay, God.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.254
- What is--

12:01.354 --> 12:03.223
Gosh, this buckle.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.459
- Do you need some help
with that leather strap, sir?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.896
- Yeah, yeah, uh,
in the--in the back.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.297
- Let's get this out.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.369
- Seeing you with
a full head of hair?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.338
Yeah, it's really weird.
Yeah.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.940
Actually, I'm really happy
that you're working together.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.843
It's nice that we can be
around each other again.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.012
- Yeah.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.246
I kissed Zach.

12:27.981 --> 12:28.982
No, I know. I know.
He told me.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.450
- Oh.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.052
- And who is this
tall drink of water?

12:32.152 --> 12:34.221
- This is our Khal Drogo.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.789
- I can see that.

12:35.889 --> 12:36.924
You're not fired again.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.458
You're my date for tonight.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.360
- No, no, no, honey.
I'm just here to cut meat.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.761
- I am the Mother of Dragons.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.363
You're my sun and my stars,

12:43.463 --> 12:44.998
and it's time to Nae Nae.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.867
- Just do what she says.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.375
*

12:55.475 --> 12:57.344
So the website was right,
wasn't it?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.813
It's very festive.
- But casual.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.414
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.289
- Yeah, I'm good.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.559
Actually, I feel like
we should talk

13:12.659 --> 13:15.062
about what happened
at the hospital the other day.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.496
- Yeah, that would be great.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.098
- 'Cause I didn't like
the way that felt.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.501
And I thought it was,
um, inappropriate.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.404
- Absolutely, yes. Um--

13:24.504 --> 13:26.439
And, you know,
it's okay, because, you know,

13:26.539 --> 13:30.844
sometimes we act in ways
that are not our normal selves.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.045
- Yeah.
- And, you know,

13:32.145 --> 13:33.313
you regret that,
and that's okay.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.848
- Right. Exactly.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.083
So you won't do that again.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.851
- I said, you won't
do that again.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.486
- Sorry, I'm a little bit
confused

13:39.586 --> 13:41.354
'cause I thought you were
apologizing to me.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.123
- Because you contradicted

13:43.223 --> 13:45.025
a very simple request
that I had.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.860
- Okay, as I remember it,

13:46.960 --> 13:49.529
I requested a simple favor,
right?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.865
And then instead of behaving
like a normal person,

13:51.965 --> 13:54.902
you turned into some sort of,
like, White Walker.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.537
- Okay, so what actually
happened was,

13:57.637 --> 14:00.941
you demanded a favor
in front of a fellow nurse.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.542
- It was just Jeff, though.
- Okay.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.912
So it starts with Jeff,
and then it goes on

14:05.012 --> 14:06.479
to other people.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.515
- It's very complicated,
all right?

14:08.615 --> 14:11.451
To date somebody at work,
it's difficult.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.553
You know, I know
because I've done it.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.922
In my experience--
- I've also done it.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.924
I've had lots of relationships.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.526
I mean, just a couple.
And they were not at work--

14:19.626 --> 14:21.428
Some of them were at work.
- Okay, I've had experiences

14:21.528 --> 14:23.430
where people use my status
at the hospital

14:23.530 --> 14:25.032
to climb the ladder.
- Oh, and you think that

14:25.132 --> 14:26.900
that's the kind of person
that I am?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.468
- I'm not saying that.
I'm not--

14:28.568 --> 14:30.337
- Because if that's the case,
why would you even

14:30.437 --> 14:31.905
go on a date with someone
if you thought that they were

14:32.005 --> 14:34.141
trying to use your status
or your "stay-tus"

14:34.241 --> 14:36.443
or whatever--however you say it.
- Maggie!

14:36.543 --> 14:39.346
- Okay.
- Wow, two nights in one week.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.048
Are you ready
to rock some guac?

14:41.148 --> 14:42.882
- Yeah, that sounds good.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.584
Do you know what?
Do you think, um--

14:44.684 --> 14:46.453
do you think you could go away
and we do this later?

14:46.553 --> 14:49.022
- Thank you.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.423
- No, George, actually,
I would like

14:50.523 --> 14:51.959
to rock the guac,
if you don't mind.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.526
- Okay.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.128
We do what I want?
- Yeah, let's do that.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.163
Let's do what she wants.
Let's do what she wants.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.032
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.968
Let's not do that,
'cause he's the chief resident

15:01.068 --> 15:03.603
of tableside guac,
so what he says goes.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.105
Okay.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.940
- That's not what
I'm saying, is it now?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.208
Listen, listen,
we do

15:08.308 --> 15:09.943
- George...
- We do want it.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.145
- We don't want it.
- George, come back here

15:12.245 --> 15:13.613
because we do want it.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.648
- Okay, I swear to God,
if you crack open

15:15.748 --> 15:17.650
an avocado,
I will lose my mind.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.122
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.924
This is not going well.
- Come on.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.660
Maggie, please.
- These booths are ridiculous.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.131
I expected better from you.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.535
- Maggie.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.705
- Yes, I would.
- Okay.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.108
The guac is usually for two.
- Great.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.111
.

15:47.247 --> 15:47.280
- How do you guys
come up with this stuff?

15:47.814 --> 15:49.282
The Red Wedding cake.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.617
- Apparently,
in some cultures,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.452
the bride wears red
instead of white.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.354
- Emma, it's blood.
The red is blood.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.655
Why?
- I'd love to book

15:55.755 --> 15:57.290
you two for the fall.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.126
My daughter Natalie
turns 13 in October,

15:59.226 --> 16:01.394
and she loves
"Orange is the New Black."

16:01.494 --> 16:03.163
- I will start

16:03.263 --> 16:04.664
ordering the jumpsuits.
- Okay.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.334
- Now, tell me,
is she open to a face tattoo?

16:07.434 --> 16:09.269
- Point me to your
roast beef station.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.337
- Wait, what happened
with your date?

16:10.437 --> 16:12.072
- Well, it was a disaster,

16:12.172 --> 16:13.506
'cause he only cares
about his dumb reputation,

16:13.606 --> 16:15.308
and I'm not interested.
- I'm so sorry.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.576
Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.378
I want to shove my mouth
full of meat,

16:18.478 --> 16:19.612
and then I want
to hit the dance floor.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.181
- Okay.
- Hey, White Walker,

16:21.281 --> 16:22.449
give me one of them
beef sliders.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.286
I ain't afraid of you, man.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.555
I ain't afraid of nobody.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.526
- Hey, Daija, this has been
a lot of fun,

16:33.626 --> 16:36.096
but I really got to get back
to my real girlfriend.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.166
- Call me Khaleesi.
- Okay, Khaleesi, I just--

16:39.266 --> 16:42.635
Ow!
- Hello, Greg, Julie.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.471
This is my boyfriend,
Khal Drogo.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.506
- Uh, no, no, no.
No, not her boyfriend.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.076
- He's a real man.
- I'm a grown man,

16:49.176 --> 16:51.444
which means I'm a not dating
a 13-year-old, so...

16:51.544 --> 16:54.247
- We're in love and we're gonna
get married and live in Queens.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.316
- Okay, I'm out, 'cause I was
just supposed to cut meat.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.085
That's all I'm supposed to do.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.422
- My party is ruined!
Everybody, go home!

17:02.522 --> 17:04.591
- Oh, no.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.526
Hey, hey,
what's going on?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.495
- Julie was my best friend.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.563
And I liked Greg,
but Greg didn't like me.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.732
He liked Julie.
So now me and Julie

17:12.832 --> 17:15.735
have to be mortal enemies.
- Okay, well,

17:15.835 --> 17:18.305
you don't have
to hate each other.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.673
I mean, I used to be married
to Khal Drogo.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.210
- That's right.
- But then we got a divorce,

17:23.310 --> 17:25.445
and now he's
Emma's boyfriend.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.680
- I mean, actually,
we're closer than ever.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.583
- It wasn't easy at first,
but we worked on it

17:30.683 --> 17:33.553
because, well,
Emma's important to me.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.189
- Oh, Teens,
you're important to me.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.425
- Come here.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.493
- Hold up.
Let me get this straight.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.595
That fine man
was married to you,

17:42.695 --> 17:45.398
keeping it tight
and also right?

17:45.498 --> 17:48.168
But now he's with her?
- Yes.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.502
- I've got one thing
to say about that.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.138
- Please, we were having
such a good moment.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.572
- Downgrade!

17:52.672 --> 17:54.641
- Well, at least you got
your Nae Nae on.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.377
- I didn't even. They didn't
play it while I was here.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.379
- Aw.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.481
Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.586
What is he doing here?
- I might've texted him.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.488
- And why do you
have his number?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.190
- Remember when you told me
I shouldn't Google

18:10.290 --> 18:11.758
about cancer anymore?
- Yeah.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.361
- Well, he said instead of
Googling, I should text him.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.229
So at 3:00 a.m.,
I'll text him, like,

18:16.329 --> 18:17.597
"Hey, am I gonna die?"

18:17.697 --> 18:20.267
And he texts back,
"No, stupid. Go to bed."

18:20.367 --> 18:22.402
- Yeah, dummy.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.803
'Cause he's a good guy.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.672
Now, go to him.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.209
Come on.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.519
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.755
Um, so listen,
I had long talk with George.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.824
- Yeah, we had a--

18:44.924 --> 18:47.394
we had a lot of
tableside guac to finish.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.828
And he asked me
why we were fighting.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.432
And I don't know
why we were fighting.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.633
- Yeah, I don't either.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.602
Why did that get so crazy
so fast?

18:55.702 --> 18:57.304
- It was my fault,
and I'm sorry.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.706
- No, I am sorry.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.675
It was--it was all my fault.
- No, because I overreacted.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.511
- No, I overreacted,
and I'm sorry.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.746
- Okay. We're doing it again.
- We are, yeah.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.449
- I will say this:
I don't love to be wrong.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.652
And I need to tell you
that I do believe

19:12.752 --> 19:14.587
that I was inappropriate
last week.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.556
- No, I, um--

19:16.656 --> 19:19.859
I was the one
who handled it badly.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.329
Look, I really like you.
- I like you.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.531
- And I don't like
how all this got started.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.571
- Is it possible to do...

19:36.843 --> 19:39.846
- That's my, uh, answer.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.749
- Well, I like
that answer. Um...

19:42.849 --> 19:46.353
- But I mean, we are--we are
gonna have to work together.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.355
Is that gonna be
too complicated for you?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.765
That's my answer.
- Should we just

19:58.865 --> 20:00.467
answer each other all night?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.369
- That would be really good.

20:02.469 --> 20:07.474
- * Close for you

20:14.581 --> 20:14.714
.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.250
- Milady,
the meat has been carved,

20:18.117 --> 20:18.551
and my sword
has been sheathed.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.953
- Oh, thank you most kindly,
horse man.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.389
- Actually, I'm a horse lord.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.623
- Well, I've got
some good news.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.225
I just booked us
three more parties.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.228
- Tina, yes! Oh!
Bring it in here, guys.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.464
We nailed it. We nailed it.
- Oh, guys.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.433
Nice.
- Excuse me!

20:33.533 --> 20:36.269
Thank you for my wonderful party
and for the advice.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.638
- Oh, you're welcome, Daija.
And happy birthday.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.707
Uh-oh.
- Hold me tighter, Greg!

20:40.807 --> 20:43.242
You're a man, not a boy.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.244
- What happened
with Julie?

20:45.345 --> 20:47.013
- Julie's out.
Greg's with me now.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.648
- Daija, that's not
what we said.

20:48.748 --> 20:53.252
- You play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.487
Greg, tighter!

20:54.587 --> 20:56.656
- I'm sorry,
did she kill Julie?
