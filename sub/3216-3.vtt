NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:

00:04.672 --> 00:06.465
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.008
Now, Dean. Go!

00:09.468 --> 00:10.594
JOHN:
Mary! No!

00:13.097 --> 00:14.890
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.059
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.604
I swore I was done hunting.

00:20.813 --> 00:23.232
I can't do this alone.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.568
No!

00:27.570 --> 00:28.863
We got work to do.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.991
This is Dad's single
most valuable possession.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.493
Everything he knows
about every evil thing is in here.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.121
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.749
Saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

00:39.832 --> 00:43.210
No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.005
Sam, you know we're gonna
find Dad, right?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.466
Yeah, I know.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.984
SOPHIE: Morning, Daddy.
-Morning, sweetheart.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.696
All these workouts, Soph,
I don't know.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.531
Guys don't like buff girls.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.243
Yeah, well, girls don't like guys
who still live at home.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.705
(CHUCKLING)

01:22.416 --> 01:25.669
-Be careful.
-I will.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.003
(MUSIC PLAYING)

03:01.181 --> 03:03.434
Can I get you anything else?

03:06.061 --> 03:09.231
-Just the check, please.
-Okay.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.197
You know, Sam, we are allowed
to have fun once in awhile.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.327
That's fun.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.124
Here, take a look at this.
Think I got one.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.626
Lake Manitoc, Wisconsin.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.253
Last week, Sophie Carlton, 18...

03:31.462 --> 03:34.131
...walks into the lake,
doesn't walk out.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.800
Authorities dragged the water.
Nothing.

03:37.009 --> 03:40.220
Sophie Carlton is the third
Lake Manitoc drowning this year.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.140
None of the bodies were found.
Had a funeral two days ago.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.433
-Funeral?
-It's weird.

03:44.516 --> 03:49.229
They buried an empty coffin.
For closure or whatever.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.232
Closure? What closure?

03:52.441 --> 03:56.236
People don't just disappear, Dean.
Other people just stop looking for them.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.658
-Something you wanna say to me?
-The trail for Dad.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.452
-It's getting colder every day.
-Exactly.

04:03.535 --> 04:07.164
-So, what are we supposed to do?
-I don't know. Something. Anything.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.874
You know, I'm sick of this attitude.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.460
-I wanna find Dad as much as you do.
-Yeah, I know you do.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.338
I've been with him every day
for the past two years...

04:14.421 --> 04:16.298
...while you've been off to college.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.758
We will find Dad.

04:18.008 --> 04:22.262
But until then, we're gonna kill
everything bad between here and there.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.181
Okay?

04:30.312 --> 04:32.690
All right. Lake Manitoc.

04:32.898 --> 04:33.941
-Hey.
-Huh?

04:34.149 --> 04:35.401
How far?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.965
DEAN: Will Carlton?
-Yeah, that's right.

04:58.173 --> 05:02.803
I'm Agent Ford, this is Agent Hamill.
We're with the U.S. Wildlife Service.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.771
She was about 100 yards out.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.608
-That's where she got dragged down.
-You sure she didn't just drown?

05:16.817 --> 05:21.071
Yeah. She was a varsity swimmer.
She practically grew up in that lake.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.366
She was as safe out there
as in her own bathtub.

05:24.450 --> 05:28.537
-So no splashing? No signs of distress?
-No, that's what I'm telling you.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.998
Did you see any shadows
in the water?

05:31.081 --> 05:34.126
Maybe some dark shape
breach the surface?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.545
No, I-- Again, she was
really far out there.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.506
-Ever see strange tracks by the shoreline?
-No, never.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.176
Why? Why?
What do you think's out there?

05:42.384 --> 05:44.511
We'll let you know as soon as we do.

05:46.722 --> 05:50.476
What about your father?
Can we talk to him?

05:52.019 --> 05:55.272
Look, if you don't mind--
I mean, he didn't see anything.

05:55.481 --> 05:58.859
-And he's kind of been through a lot.
-We understand.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.285
Now, I'm sorry,
but why does the Wildlife Service...

06:08.494 --> 06:10.454
...care about an accidental drowning?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.289
You sure it's accidental?

06:12.498 --> 06:14.750
Will Carlton saw something
grab his sister.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.543
JAKE:
Like what?

06:16.752 --> 06:20.589
Here, sit, please. There are no
indigenous carnivores in that lake.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.509
There's nothing big enough
to pull down a person...

06:23.592 --> 06:26.178
...unless it was
the Loch Ness monster.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.846
Yeah. Right.

06:28.055 --> 06:32.226
Will Carlton was traumatized,
and sometimes the mind plays tricks.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.521
Still, we dragged that entire lake.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.565
We even ran a sonar sweep,
just to be sure.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.527
-And there was nothing down there.
-That's weird, though.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.363
I mean, that's the third
missing body this year.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.989
I know.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.033
These are people from my town.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.452
-These are people I care about.
-I know.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.831
Anyway...

06:54.540 --> 06:59.628
...all this, it won't be
a problem much longer.

06:59.711 --> 07:03.340
-What do you mean?
-Well, the dam, of course.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.426
Of course. The dam.

07:07.010 --> 07:11.640
-It has, yeah, sprung a leak.
-It's falling apart.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.810
And the feds won't give us
the grant to repair it.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.104
So they've opened the spillway.

07:17.312 --> 07:21.066
In another six months,
there won't be much of a lake.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.860
Won't be much of a town either.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.280
But as Federal Wildlife,
you already knew that.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.531
Exactly.

07:27.823 --> 07:31.660
Sorry, am I interrupting?
I can come back later.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.037
Gentlemen, this is my daughter.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.498
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Dean.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.959
-Andrea Barr. Hi.
-Hi.

07:39.209 --> 07:43.380
They're from the Wildlife Service,
about the lake.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.757
Oh.

07:46.675 --> 07:50.262
Oh, well, hey there.
What's your name?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.644
His name is Lucas.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.358
-Is he okay?
-My grandson has been through a lot.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.402
We all have.

08:05.611 --> 08:09.781
Well, if there's anything else
I can do for you, please let me know.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.491
DEAN:
Thanks.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.285
Now that you mentioned it...

08:13.493 --> 08:16.538
...could you point us in the direction
of a reasonably priced motel?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.708
Lakefront Motel. Go around the corner,
it's two blocks up.

08:19.791 --> 08:23.337
Two--? Would you mind showing us?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.715
-You want me to walk you two blocks?
-Not if it's any trouble.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.593
I'm headed that way anyway.

08:29.801 --> 08:34.556
I'll be back to pick up Lucas at 3.
We'll go to the park, okay, sweetie?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.561
Thanks again.

08:39.895 --> 08:43.565
-So, cute kid.
ANDREA: Thanks.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.526
Kids are the best, huh?

08:49.571 --> 08:51.240
ANDREA:
There it is.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.575
-Like I said, two blocks.
-Thanks.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.246
Must be hard
with your sense of direction.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.332
Never being able to find your way
to a decent pickup line.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.585
Enjoy your stay.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.463
"Kids are the best"?

09:06.672 --> 09:08.548
-You don't even like kids.
-I love kids.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.676
Name three children
that you even know.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.934
I'm thinking.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.478
So there's the three
drowning victims this year.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.772
-And before that?
-Uh, yeah.

09:23.855 --> 09:27.317
Six more, spread out
over the past 35 years.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.361
Those bodies were
never recovered either.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.489
If there is something out there,
it's picking up its pace.

09:32.698 --> 09:36.618
-So we got a lake monster on a binge?
-This lake-monster theory, it bugs me.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.120
Why?

09:38.203 --> 09:39.579
Loch Ness. Lake Champlain.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.624
There are literally hundreds
of eyewitness accounts.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.376
But here, almost nothing.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.587
Whatever it is out there,
no one's living to talk about it.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.174
Wait. Barr. Christopher Barr.
Where have I heard that name before?

09:51.383 --> 09:54.594
Christopher Barr, the victim in May.

09:54.803 --> 09:59.683
Oh. Christopher Barr was
Andrea's husband. Lucas' father.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.769
Apparently, he took Lucas
out swimming.

10:02.853 --> 10:06.273
Lucas was on a floating wooden platform
when Chris drowned...

10:06.356 --> 10:09.818
...two hours before the kid got rescued.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.407
Maybe we have
an eyewitness after all.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.910
No wonder that kid
was so freaked out.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.748
Watching one of your parents die
isn't something you just get over.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.834
SAM:
Can we join you?

10:29.212 --> 10:31.548
I'm here with my son.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.510
Oh. Mind if I say hi?

10:37.554 --> 10:41.016
Tell your friend this whole Jerry Maguire
thing is not gonna work on me.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.770
I don't think that's what this is about.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.774
DEAN:
How's it going?

10:55.781 --> 10:58.742
Oh, I used to love these things.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.953
(IMITATING GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSION)

11:04.331 --> 11:06.792
So crayons is more your thing?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.795
That's cool. Chicks dig artists.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.423
Hey, these are pretty good.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.134
You mind if I sit and draw with you
for a while?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.137
I'm not so bad myself.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.940
You know, I'm thinking
you can hear me...

11:30.148 --> 11:31.817
...you just don't want to talk.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.195
I don't know exactly what happened
to your dad...

11:35.445 --> 11:38.073
...but I know
it was something real bad.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.370
I think I know how you feel.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.208
When I was your age,
I saw something.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.924
Anyway....

11:57.217 --> 12:02.722
Well, maybe you don't think
anyone will listen to you or, uh...

12:03.723 --> 12:05.225
...or believe you.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.853
I want you to know that I will.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.605
You don't even have to say anything.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.775
You could draw me a picture
about what you saw that day...

12:13.984 --> 12:18.196
...with your dad on the lake.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.326
Okay. No problem.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.954
This is for you.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.540
This is my family.

12:28.623 --> 12:32.627
That's my dad, and that's....

12:32.836 --> 12:34.379
That's my mom.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.840
That's my geek brother.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.050
And that's me.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.558
All right, so I'm a sucky artist.
I'll see you around, Lucas.

12:58.904 --> 13:02.157
Lucas hasn't said a word,
not even to me.

13:02.365 --> 13:06.578
Not since his dad's accident.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.956
Yeah, we heard. Sorry.

13:10.165 --> 13:14.878
-What do the doctors say?
-That it's a kind of post-traumatic stress.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.047
That can't be easy for either of you.

13:17.130 --> 13:21.927
We moved in with my dad.
He helps out a lot.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.013
It's just...

13:25.847 --> 13:30.018
...when I think about what Lucas
went through, what he saw....

13:31.561 --> 13:33.188
DEAN:
Kids are strong.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.857
You'd be surprised
what they can deal with.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.402
You know, he used to have such life.

13:39.694 --> 13:43.031
He was hard to keep up with,
to tell you the truth.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.366
Now he just sits there...

13:44.449 --> 13:47.661
...drawing those pictures,
playing with those Army men.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.706
I just wish-- Hey, sweetie.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.838
Thanks. Thanks, Lucas.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.984
Hey, Dad?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.862
You should probably eat something.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.157
I'm gonna make some dinner, okay?

16:22.440 --> 16:26.277
-So we can safely rule out Nessie.
DEAN: What do you mean?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.739
I just drove past the Carlton house.
There was an ambulance there.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.157
Will Carlton is dead.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.910
-He drowned?
-Yep, in the sink.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.787
What the hell?

16:35.870 --> 16:38.039
This isn't a creature,
it's something else.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.708
-Yeah, but what?
-Don't know.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.252
Water Wraith, maybe?
Some kind of demon?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.462
I mean, something that
controls water.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.717
-Water that comes from the same source.
-The lake.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.136
Which explains why
it's upping the body count.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.971
The lake will be dry
in a few months.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.766
Whatever this thing is, whatever
it wants, it's running out of time.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.893
And if it can get through the pipes...

16:58.977 --> 17:01.187
...it can get to anyone,
almost anywhere.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.356
This is gonna happen again, soon.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.233
And we know one other thing for sure.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.318
This has something to do
with Bill Carlton.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.571
-It took both his kids.
-And I asked around.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.657
Lucas' dad, Chris?
Bill Carlton's godson.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.326
Let's go pay Mr. Carlton a visit.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.412
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

17:17.662 --> 17:19.748
SAM:
Mr. Carlton?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.127
We'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.547
-We're from the Department--
-I don't care who you're with.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.508
I've answered enough questions today.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.596
Your son said
he saw something in that lake.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.892
What about you?
You ever see anything out there?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.563
Mr. Carlton, Sophie's drowning
and Will's death...

17:43.772 --> 17:46.316
...we think there's a connection
to you or your family.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.194
My children are gone.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.364
It's....

17:55.784 --> 17:57.702
It's worse than dying.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.711
Go away.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.963
Please.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.176
SAM:
What do you think?

18:13.384 --> 18:15.804
I think the poor guy
has been through hell.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.891
-Also think he's not telling us something.
-So now what?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.645
What is it?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.189
Huh?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.901
Maybe Bill's not the only one
who knows something.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.914
ANDREA: I don't think it's a good idea.
DEAN: I just need to talk to him.

18:42.997 --> 18:46.167
-Just for a few minutes.
-He won't say anything.

18:46.251 --> 18:49.838
-What good is it gonna do?
-Andrea, more people might get hurt.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.590
Something's happening out there.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.969
My husband, the others,
they just drowned. That's all.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.304
DEAN: If that's what
you really believe, we'll go.

18:58.513 --> 19:03.893
But if you think there's even a possibility
something else could be going on here...

19:04.269 --> 19:06.521
...please let me talk to your son.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.454
Hey, Lucas.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.082
Remember me?

19:34.424 --> 19:36.968
You know, I, uh....

19:37.886 --> 19:41.097
I wanted to thank you
for that last drawing.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.853
But the thing is,
I need your help again.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.035
How did you know to draw this?

20:04.329 --> 20:07.123
Did you know something bad
was gonna happen?

20:08.458 --> 20:13.129
Maybe you could nod
yes or no for me.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.008
You're scared.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.307
It's okay. I understand.

20:24.515 --> 20:29.354
See, when I was your age, I saw
something real bad happen to my mom.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.399
And I was scared too.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.488
I didn't feel like talking,
just like you.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.908
But, see, my mom...

20:43.368 --> 20:46.287
...I know she wanted me to be brave.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.167
I think about that every day.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.758
And I do my best to be brave.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.180
And maybe your dad...

21:05.390 --> 21:08.059
...wants you to be brave too.

21:28.913 --> 21:29.998
Thanks, Lucas.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.380
She said he never drew like that
till his dad died.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.883
There are cases where going through
a traumatic experience...

21:41.092 --> 21:45.388
...could make people more sensitive
to premonitions, psychic tendencies.

21:45.596 --> 21:48.182
Whatever's out there,
what if Lucas is tapping into it?

21:48.391 --> 21:52.562
It's only a matter of time before someone
else drowns. If you got a better lead....

21:52.770 --> 21:54.814
All right.
We got another house to find.

21:55.023 --> 21:58.609
The problem is there's a thousand
yellow two-stories in this county alone.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.236
See this church?

22:00.445 --> 22:03.197
I bet there's less than a thousand
of those around here.

22:03.406 --> 22:07.243
Oh, college boy.
Thinks he's so smart.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.376
You know, um...

22:16.836 --> 22:19.213
...what you said about Mom...

22:21.049 --> 22:22.508
...you never told me that before.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.595
It's no big deal.

22:28.848 --> 22:32.185
Oh, God. We're not gonna have
to hug or anything, are we?

22:57.877 --> 23:01.464
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but does a little boy live here, by chance?

23:02.256 --> 23:06.552
He might wear a blue ball cap,
has a red bicycle.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.679
No, sir.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.891
Not for a very long time.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.729
Peter's been gone 35 years now.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.442
The police never....

23:21.651 --> 23:25.488
I never had any idea what happened.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.867
He just disappeared.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.703
Losing him....

23:34.038 --> 23:38.126
You know, it's....

23:39.127 --> 23:41.754
It's worse than dying.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.761
Did he disappear from here?
I mean, from this house?

23:48.970 --> 23:54.892
He was supposed to ride his bike
straight home after school...

23:55.101 --> 23:57.603
...and he never showed up.

24:13.536 --> 24:17.373
"Peter Sweeney
and Billy Carlton, 1970."

24:23.004 --> 24:25.339
BILL:
Taken everything.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.759
Everyone.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.972
I've got nothing left.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.269
I didn't understand.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.480
I didn't believe.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.943
Now I think I do.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.239
I think I finally know what you want.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.662
Okay, this little boy,
Peter Sweeney, vanishes...

24:56.871 --> 24:59.040
...and this is all connected
to Bill Carlton.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.375
Yeah. Bill sure seems to be
hiding something, huh?

25:01.584 --> 25:03.753
And the people he loves
are getting punished.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.964
-What if Bill did something to Peter?
-What if Bill killed him?

25:07.173 --> 25:10.384
Peter's spirit would be furious.
It'd want revenge. It's possible.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.767
Mr. Carlton!

25:19.894 --> 25:22.271
Hey, check it out.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.574
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

25:33.824 --> 25:35.993
DEAN: Turn the boat around!
-Mr. Carlton!

25:50.341 --> 25:52.551
Baby, what's wrong?

25:55.096 --> 26:00.142
Sam, Dean,
I didn't expect to see you here.

26:00.351 --> 26:03.020
So now you're on a first-name basis.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.731
-What are you doing here?
ANDREA: I brought you dinner.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.694
JAKE: Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I don't really have the time.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.782
I heard about Bill Carlton.

26:14.991 --> 26:18.244
Is it true?
Is something going on with the lake?

26:19.203 --> 26:21.330
Right now, we don't know
what the truth is.

26:21.539 --> 26:24.500
But I think it might be better
if you and Lucas went on home.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.629
Lucas, wait, what is it?

26:28.838 --> 26:30.423
ANDREA: Lucas.
DEAN: Lucas.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.633
Lucas. It's okay.
It's okay. Hey.

26:32.842 --> 26:36.470
Lucas, it's okay. It's okay.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.368
JAKE:
Okay, just so I'm clear...

26:59.577 --> 27:04.582
...you see something
attack Bill's boat...

27:04.665 --> 27:09.670
...sending Bill, who is a very good
swimmer, by the way...

27:09.754 --> 27:11.630
...into the drink...

27:11.839 --> 27:14.592
...and you never see him again?

27:16.010 --> 27:18.971
-Yeah. That about sums it up.
-I'm supposed to believe this...

27:19.180 --> 27:22.058
...even though I've already
sonar-swept that entire lake...

27:22.266 --> 27:25.061
...and what you're describing
is impossible?

27:25.269 --> 27:27.313
And you're not really Wildlife Service.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.691
That's right. I checked.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.902
The Department's
never heard of you two.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.654
-See, now, we can explain that--
-Enough.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.532
Please.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.701
The only reason
you're breathing free air...

27:41.327 --> 27:45.081
...is one of Bill's neighbors saw him
steering out that boat before you did.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.626
So we have a couple of options here.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.420
I can arrest you
for impersonating government officials...

27:51.504 --> 27:54.423
...and hold you as witnesses
to Bill Carlton's disappearance...

27:54.632 --> 27:58.511
...or we can chalk this all up
to a bad day.

27:58.719 --> 28:03.641
You get into your car, you put this town
in your rear-view mirror...

28:03.724 --> 28:07.812
...and you don't ever
darken my doorstep again.

28:10.022 --> 28:14.068
-Door number two sounds good.
-That's the one I'd pick.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.126
Baby.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.546
What are you doing up?

28:35.589 --> 28:38.134
Come on, let's go to bed.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.406
-Green.
-What?

29:00.614 --> 29:02.700
Light's green.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.877
SAM: Interstate's the other way.
-I know.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.028
-But, Dean, this job, I think it's over.
-I'm not so sure.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.406
If Bill murdered Peter Sweeney,
and Peter's spirit got revenge...

29:42.615 --> 29:44.325
...case closed.
The spirit's at rest.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.577
So, what if we leave
and this thing isn't done?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.538
What if we missed something,
what if more people get hurt?

29:49.747 --> 29:51.957
But why would you think that?

29:52.583 --> 29:54.460
Because Lucas was really scared.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.754
That's what this is about?

29:56.962 --> 29:59.465
I just don't wanna leave
until I know that kid's okay.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.135
Who are you, and what have
you done with my brother?

30:05.179 --> 30:07.014
Shut up.

31:02.820 --> 31:06.490
BOY: Come play with me.
Come play with me.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.828
(SCREAMING)

31:31.682 --> 31:35.686
BOY:
Come play with me.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.522
You sure about this?

31:38.731 --> 31:40.149
It's pretty late, man.

31:41.775 --> 31:42.943
(GASPING)

31:43.152 --> 31:44.862
Lucas? Lucas?

31:47.781 --> 31:49.074
Lucas!

31:59.877 --> 32:03.464
(GRUNTING)

32:27.863 --> 32:30.074
Can you tell me?

32:31.075 --> 32:32.993
ANDREA:
No.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.460
It doesn't make any sense.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.217
I'm going crazy.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.260
No, you're not.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.306
Tell me what happened. Everything.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.270
I heard....

33:02.272 --> 33:04.733
I thought I heard....

33:06.443 --> 33:07.945
There was this voice.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.864
-What did it say?
-It said....

33:11.532 --> 33:14.201
It said, "Come play with me."

33:21.834 --> 33:23.836
What's happening?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.941
-You recognize the kids in these pictures?
-What?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.067
Oh, um....

33:47.276 --> 33:50.988
No. I mean, except that's
my dad right there.

33:51.405 --> 33:54.908
He must've been about 12
in these pictures.

33:56.744 --> 34:00.748
Chris Barr's drowning, the connection
wasn't to Bill Carlton, it was the sheriff.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.374
Bill and the sheriff.

34:02.583 --> 34:06.378
-They were both involved with Peter.
ANDREA: What about Chris?

34:06.587 --> 34:08.297
My dad? What are you talking about?

34:08.505 --> 34:09.798
Lucas?

34:10.007 --> 34:12.092
Lucas, what is it?

34:17.890 --> 34:20.642
ANDREA:
Lucas? Honey?

34:31.653 --> 34:34.990
You and Lucas get back to the house
and stay there, okay?

34:58.472 --> 35:00.808
Peter's bike.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.851
JAKE:
Who are you?

35:05.020 --> 35:05.938
Put the gun down, Jake.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.566
-How did you know that was there?
DEAN: What happened?

35:09.775 --> 35:10.984
You and Bill killed Peter?

35:11.485 --> 35:14.238
Drowned him in the lake
and then buried the bike?

35:14.446 --> 35:16.031
You can't bury the truth, Jake.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.826
Nothing stays buried.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.873
Go to your room, sweetie.

35:25.082 --> 35:28.877
Now. Lock the door and wait for me.
Don't come out.

35:29.086 --> 35:32.673
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You and Bill killed Peter Sweeney.

35:32.881 --> 35:33.966
-That's what.
-Dad!

35:34.424 --> 35:36.927
And now you got one
seriously pissed-off spirit.

35:37.010 --> 35:40.180
It's gonna take Andrea, Lucas,
everyone you love.

35:40.430 --> 35:44.101
It's gonna drown them, and it's gonna
drag their bodies God knows where...

35:44.184 --> 35:47.187
...so you can feel the same pain
Peter's mom felt.

35:47.271 --> 35:50.816
And then, after that,
it's gonna take you.

35:51.024 --> 35:54.069
-And it's not gonna stop until it does.
-Yeah? And how do you know that?

35:54.611 --> 35:56.905
Because that's exactly
what it did to Bill Carlton.

35:57.114 --> 36:00.075
Listen to yourself.
Both of you, you're insane.

36:00.284 --> 36:03.453
I don't really give a rat's ass
what you think of us...

36:03.662 --> 36:05.914
...but if we're gonna
bring down this spirit...

36:06.123 --> 36:09.293
...we need to find the remains,
salt them and burn them into dust.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.213
Tell me you buried Peter somewhere
and you didn't just let him go in the lake.

36:18.093 --> 36:22.055
BOY:
Come play with me.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.060
ANDREA: Dad, is any of this true?
JAKE: No.

36:27.144 --> 36:29.146
Don't listen to them.
They're dangerous.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.482
Something tried to drown me.
Chris died on that lake.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.776
Dad, look at me.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.448
Tell me you didn't kill anyone.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.667
Oh, my God.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.965
Billy and I were at the lake.

36:59.134 --> 37:02.179
Peter was the smallest one,
we always bullied him.

37:02.262 --> 37:06.892
But this time it got rough.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.773
We were holding his head
under the water.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.942
We didn't mean to...

37:15.150 --> 37:19.488
...but we held him under too long,
and he drowned.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.828
We let the body go...

37:27.204 --> 37:29.456
...and it sank.

37:35.337 --> 37:37.506
Oh, Andrea.

37:39.716 --> 37:43.178
We were kids. We were so scared.
It was a mistake.

37:43.261 --> 37:48.350
But, Andrea, to say that I have anything
to do with these drownings, with Chris....

37:48.475 --> 37:52.145
Because of some ghost?
It's not rational.

37:53.146 --> 37:56.149
All right, listen to me, all of you.

37:56.358 --> 38:00.946
We need to get you away from this lake.
As far as we can, right now.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.492
Lucas!

38:07.744 --> 38:10.998
BOY:
Come play with me.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.833
DEAN: Lucas!
ANDREA: Lucas!

38:13.041 --> 38:14.501
Baby, stay where you are!

38:33.395 --> 38:34.855
ANDREA:
Oh, my God!

38:38.233 --> 38:40.569
-Andrea, stay there!
-No. Lucas?

38:40.777 --> 38:43.155
We'll get him, just stay on the dock.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.619
ANDREA:
Lucas.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.248
Sam?

38:54.541 --> 38:57.044
ANDREA:
Lucas, where are you?

39:00.589 --> 39:04.843
Peter, if you can hear me,
please, I'm sorry.

39:05.052 --> 39:08.305
ANDREA: Daddy. Daddy, no.
-I'm so sorry.

39:08.805 --> 39:13.268
Let me--
Lucas, he's just a little boy.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.897
Please, it's not his fault, it's mine.
Please, take me!

39:18.106 --> 39:20.525
Jake, no!

39:20.734 --> 39:22.402
Just let it be over!

39:24.196 --> 39:26.698
ANDREA:
Daddy. Daddy!

39:28.825 --> 39:30.744
No!

40:22.587 --> 40:26.967
Look, we're not gonna
save everybody.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.678
I know.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.640
ANDREA: Sam, Dean.
DEAN: Hey.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.602
We're glad we caught you.
We just, um....

40:37.811 --> 40:39.938
We made you lunch for the road.

40:40.147 --> 40:42.858
Lucas insisted on making
the sandwiches himself.

40:44.067 --> 40:46.653
Can I give it to them now?

40:47.529 --> 40:48.905
ANDREA:
Of course.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.242
Come on, Lucas,
let's load this in the car.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.666
How you holding up?

41:00.917 --> 41:05.005
It's just gonna take a long time
to sort through everything, you know?

41:07.716 --> 41:09.551
Andrea, I'm sorry.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.470
You saved my son.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.308
I can't ask for more than that.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.271
Dad loved me.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.607
He loved Lucas.

41:23.690 --> 41:27.444
No matter what he did,
I just have to...

41:27.527 --> 41:29.863
...hold onto that.

41:34.576 --> 41:38.872
All right. If you're gonna be talking now,
this is a very important phrase.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.875
-Repeat it back to me one more time.
-Zeppelin rules.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.793
That's right. Up high.

41:46.880 --> 41:50.759
You take care of your mom, okay?
All right.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.600
Thank you.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.148
Sam, move your ass.

42:05.357 --> 42:08.360
We're gonna run out of daylight
before we hit the road.
