00:12.262 --> 00:15.015
Today, the story was one
of deteriorating conditions

00:15.098 --> 00:17.768
-for those trapped in the city.
-Three days after Katrina,

00:17.851 --> 00:19.937
how did New Orleans come to this?

00:20.562 --> 00:22.606
And what nature isn't ravaging,
looters are.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.317
In flooded streets,
wholesale rioting and looting erupted.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.568
-Stop!
-…people struggling

00:26.652 --> 00:28.862
-to pull their lives together.
-I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.322
…like this are devastating.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.782
…become so chaotic

00:31.865 --> 00:33.951
that New Orleans police
have found themselves understaffed--

00:34.034 --> 00:35.953
The government hasn't sent us anything.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.747
Officers are eating based on
what we find that looters didn't steal.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.916
They're saying they've been feeding us.
They're lying.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.669
Am I frustrated? Sure.
I'm frustrated, everybody's frustrated.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.712
Help! Help! Help! Help!

00:45.796 --> 00:48.048
I fully understand people
wanting things to have happened yesterday.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.091
We cannot stand by

00:49.174 --> 00:52.469
while this vital operation
is not being handled appropriately.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.971
What the state was doing, I don't know.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.641
And I blame you, Ray Nagin,
for your people out here need you.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.103
It may be remembered
as the most glaring example

01:01.186 --> 01:04.897
of how the federal, state,
and local governments failed the poorest

01:04.982 --> 01:06.191
and most needy victims of the--

01:06.275 --> 01:07.818
The government did not know

01:07.901 --> 01:09.736
about the Convention Center people
until today.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.657
We got a baby out here
that don't have no formula, no water.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.450
Where's FEMA? Where's the Man?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.162
Who's in charge here?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.914
You guys are.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.961
So, let's talk about
the fourth day at Memorial.

01:26.962 --> 01:29.339
Well, by the fourth day

01:29.423 --> 01:32.926
the water had settled to the level
of the emergency ramp at the hospital.

01:33.010 --> 01:38.390
We'd lost all power in the building.
All of our equipment.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.434
Everything that we need to help patients.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.936
The patients, they started dying,

01:43.020 --> 01:48.650
and there was nothing we could do
to help them.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.947
So, at what point
did people start panicking?

01:55.073 --> 01:56.283
We didn't panic.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.328
What, you weren't scared?

02:05.959 --> 02:11.131
After the levees broke,
it was a day-- one full day

02:11.757 --> 02:14.968
before a single person
at the city, at the state level

02:15.052 --> 02:17.679
made any kind of emergency declaration.

02:17.763 --> 02:21.016
We were surrounded by water,
and no one told us.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.103
Yes, we should've been scared.

02:25.187 --> 02:29.149
We should've started scrambling
to save patients. But we didn't.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.609
Not because we panicked,

02:30.692 --> 02:33.111
but because we didn't know enough
to panic.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.281
There were 45 bodies found
at the hospital.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.951
Were any of those patients murdered?

02:42.621 --> 02:44.998
You were head
of the hospital's ethics committee.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.125
-You're better suited than anyone…
-If you're asking me--

02:47.209 --> 02:49.962
…to determine whether or not some
of those people were killed intentionally.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.596
Ethics can be…

03:04.184 --> 03:05.519
What I can tell you--

03:05.602 --> 03:08.355
All I can tell you is that

03:09.648 --> 03:12.901
there was an organized effort

03:14.236 --> 03:19.700
to reduce the level of misery
the patients had to endure.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.913
And in those last days at Memorial…

03:28.959 --> 03:30.586
all there was, was misery.

03:34.173 --> 03:39.011
Wade in the water

03:41.054 --> 03:45.809
Wade in the water, children

03:46.894 --> 03:51.690
Wade in the water

03:51.773 --> 03:56.987
Wade in the water, children

03:57.070 --> 04:01.658
Wade in the water

04:01.742 --> 04:07.039
God is gonna trouble these waters

04:07.122 --> 04:11.126
Man went down to the river

04:12.085 --> 04:17.007
Man went down to the river, Lord

04:17.089 --> 04:21.261
Man went down to the river

04:22.095 --> 04:25.766
Went down there for to pray

04:27.392 --> 04:31.230
Wade in the water

04:32.481 --> 04:37.319
Wade in the water, children

04:37.402 --> 04:41.281
Wade in the water

04:41.990 --> 04:46.995
God is gonna trouble these waters

04:52.125 --> 04:58.131
God's gonna trouble these waters

05:20.612 --> 05:22.906
Richard? You got anything?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.450
Nothing.
None of the helicopters are landing here.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.704
All right. Well, tell me
as soon as you've got something.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.664
Will do.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.848
-Where did you get them?
-Hands off the bag.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.892
-I'm taking them.
-Who told you?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.102
Answer me.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.313
-I need these.
-Who gave you permission?

05:54.396 --> 05:56.106
I don't need your permission.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.775
-I'm taking them to patients. I need them.
-We are not--

05:58.859 --> 06:01.069
-What is going on?
-He's stealing water.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.822
-I am not stealing any wa--
-What the fuck is all that?

06:03.906 --> 06:05.449
It's the hospital's.
It doesn't belong to you.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.075
Are you assigned to this unit?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.370
-No.
-Then get off.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.081
Go!

06:19.004 --> 06:20.297
Okay, come on…

06:22.758 --> 06:24.760
Let's pick these up.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.930
-Okay.
-And give one to every patient.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.325
We've got one. They're here! Let's go!

06:51.161 --> 06:54.748
Susan! We've got a helicopter.
Start sending up patients.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.958
Jesus. Thank you, God.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.252
We'll start sending up critical ones.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.004
-Karen, are you there?
-Susan?

07:01.088 --> 07:04.466
We have a helicopter. You need
to start staging your patients now.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.301
Okay, copy. I'll start bringing them.

07:06.385 --> 07:09.221
Okay, come on.
Everybody, we're bringing them down.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.099
Okay, we're taking the patients
to the helipad. Come on. Let's go.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.476
Karen.
Karen, the elevators aren't working.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.353
Oh, fuck.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.231
Okay.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.573
Okay, get a flashlight.

07:27.656 --> 07:31.535
Everybody who is able-bodied,
please come over here.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.538
Okay. You, come over here. Okay.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.332
-Everybody, watch.
-Yep.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.752
Grab up the sides of the sheet.
Okay, keep it tight.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.755
Don't let there be any slack.
Do not move until I say so.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.215
We are gonna carry the patients

07:45.299 --> 07:48.468
all the way down to the helipad
just like this. Understand?

07:49.052 --> 07:53.473
Okay. Everybody, careful. Watch your feet.
Everybody, careful. Careful.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.435
-God, it's even hotter in here.
-Watch your step.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.728
Lift her a little higher.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.354
Yep. Slow. Slow.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.398
Watch your back. Okay.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.443
Go around the corner.

08:05.694 --> 08:06.904
Let me know when you need to rest.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.573
-Okay, watch your feet. Another corner.
-Slow. Slow.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.490
Okay.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.826
Vitals are strong. He's ready to move.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.871
Hey, hey. Wait, wait! This way, his way.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.247
We're taking critical patients first,

08:17.331 --> 08:19.166
-and it's a trek to get up to the helipad.
-Okay.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.376
You gotta go across the floor
to another corridor,

08:21.460 --> 08:22.794
back around the parking garage,

08:22.878 --> 08:25.339
-then down the ramp to get to the pad.
-Wait, how long does that take?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.300
-About 40 minutes.
-Forty minutes?

08:28.383 --> 08:30.385
-For every patient? In this heat?
-Yeah.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.261
The elevators in the parking garage
aren't working.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.056
There's no good way to get up there.
All right?

08:34.139 --> 08:35.599
-All right.
-Okay.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.726
Okay. Hey, come on! Bring her over here.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.270
-Lori, keep them patients coming down.
-Got it.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.606
Okay, come on. All right, let's go.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.483
Let's go.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.984
-Come on.
-Go. Go.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.008
What happened?

09:10.092 --> 09:13.011
She went non-communicative.
She won't take water.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.601
-Yeah, that's heatstroke.
-She's in pain.

09:19.685 --> 09:22.020
-Is there something we can give her?
-There's not enough time.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.313
-Not enough time?
-Yeah.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.440
-I have to get ready to move patients.
-She is in pain.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.068
Get her a damp towel,

09:28.151 --> 09:29.903
-keep her cool--
-You're just gonna let her suffer?

09:30.612 --> 09:31.655
Anna.

09:52.009 --> 09:55.596
Ken, I need something
for acute discomfort for a patient.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.348
-Discomfort?
-Pain. Pain!

09:58.432 --> 09:59.641
We have morphine.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.351
I need five milligrams.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.187
You'll have to fill out a prescription.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.022
Are you kidding?

10:05.105 --> 10:08.150
We have to keep records.
Even with all this,

10:08.233 --> 10:10.485
we have to maintain some kind of protocol.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.165
Can you hurry?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.299
Can you please hurry?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.960
-Anna.
-I'm not letting her suffer.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.682
Okay, she's comfortable for now
until we can get her out of here.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.518
Anna.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.772
Some of the staff,
they've been going to their cars.

11:28.856 --> 11:32.276
Turning on the air conditioning,
listening to a little music.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.697
Horace. I'm okay. I'm fine.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.287
Have got to find a way
to get the patients to the pad faster.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.539
-Just any way you can.
-Yeah. Yeah. I got it. I got it.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.374
What's this?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.126
You wanted a list
of our LifeCare patients.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.086
-Right. Thank you.
-With the patients who were here

11:51.170 --> 11:53.297
at the hospital
and the ones we transferred over,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.632
-it's 53 altogether. We lost two.
-Okay.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.593
-Susan. I'm sorry.
-We have another seven who--

11:57.676 --> 12:00.971
-I'm sorry. Excuse me.
-We need to suspend all intravenous care.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.391
The select is just too high a risk,
for extravasation--

12:04.474 --> 12:05.851
Excuse me.

12:06.810 --> 12:07.811
The list.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.146
Sandra has got it.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.106
Well, what is she gonna--
What-- Excuse me.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.859
-What are you gonna do with it?
-I'm gonna…

12:13.942 --> 12:16.570
We are doing the best we can,

12:16.653 --> 12:18.572
and we will let you know what we find out.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.199
What is there to find out?

12:21.074 --> 12:25.579
We have 54--
53 patients we need evacuated.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.208
We were waiting for National Guard trucks
that didn't come.

12:30.042 --> 12:34.588
We were waiting for helicopters
that haven't arrived. We have your list.

12:34.671 --> 12:39.510
We will work your patients
into our rotation as best we can.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.347
Now, what you should do is go back
and be with your patients.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.684
I need you to talk to the unit managers.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.229
We have got to start
conserving food and water.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.648
We gotta go to the minimum.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.982
Healthy patients…

13:09.206 --> 13:11.250
Help! We need help!

13:12.376 --> 13:15.212
No, please. Help us, please!

13:17.130 --> 13:19.591
We need help. Okay? Come on, man.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.135
Help out. We need help.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.889
Come on in. I got you. Come on in.

13:25.973 --> 13:26.807
Thank you.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.517
-Keep coming. Keep coming.
-Come on, Mama.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.270
People see the helicopters
taking off from the pad.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.772
They think we can help get 'em to safety.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.693
Hospital's like a lighthouse in a storm.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.529
And they're coming to us.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.323
How many?

13:43.407 --> 13:44.867
About ten so far.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.413
-We can't take any more people.
-We're a hospital.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.833
We're in full evacuation mode.
We can't take care of the people we have.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.585
How are we
supposed to take care of anyone else?

13:54.668 --> 13:58.297
How are we gonna keep people away?
I mean, call the police?

13:59.715 --> 14:03.677
Even if we could, clearly,
the police don't give a shit about us.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.638
So what are we supposed to do?

14:08.348 --> 14:12.144
We supposed to shoot people?
Is that what we're talking about?

14:20.527 --> 14:23.322
We're talking about doing
what's necessary.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.255
The Superdome,
home to 20,000 storm-weary people,

14:40.339 --> 14:41.924
is surrounded by water.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.885
Inside, the toilets
and air conditioning are broken.

14:44.968 --> 14:49.640
I've asked the president to give us
all the resources possible today.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.641
Michael.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.310
I'm being told
that the Coast Guard helicopters

14:53.393 --> 14:56.647
are not gonna evacuate those patients
from that other hospital, from LifeCare.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.564
What?

14:57.648 --> 15:01.109
I'm being told that the LifeCare patients
aren't on some list.

15:01.193 --> 15:04.821
They sent us the names. It's 53 patients.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.325
Those patients are not on the list
that Tenet sent to the Coast Guard.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.993
I'm in touch with the Guard.
We can tell them--

15:10.077 --> 15:12.204
-Michael.
-It's 53 people.

15:12.287 --> 15:16.083
All I know is the Coast Guard choppers are
for Memorial patients.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.717
What did they tell you?

15:25.801 --> 15:28.804
Something about--
They radioed the Coast Guard.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.764
They can't take any of our patients.

15:31.723 --> 15:36.353
"Ten pallets of water. Portable O2 tanks.
20Ds. 12Es. Sixty--"

15:36.436 --> 15:39.523
Susan. What are you telling my people?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.277
I told her what was communicated to me.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.153
That you're not helping our patients?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.949
Our corporation has secured transportation
for our patients--

15:49.032 --> 15:51.410
Those are Coast Guard helicopters.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.704
Your corporation
doesn't own the Coast Guard.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.874
Now, I gave you a list of names.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.876
Why aren't we being evacuated
with everybody--

15:58.959 --> 16:02.838
If I could get an answer,
I'd give one. I can't.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.761
You're getting your people out…

16:11.763 --> 16:12.764
and…

16:15.100 --> 16:16.935
you're leaving ours to die?

16:39.082 --> 16:44.880
"Sixty-five doses of insulin.
Fourteen bags of D50."

16:45.881 --> 16:50.677
And we're low on NSAIDs, antibiotics,
anti-nausea, anti-seizure meds.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.153
They shot him. They just--

17:08.737 --> 17:12.491
-So, this brother was looting?
-He was taking diapers.

17:12.574 --> 17:13.951
Cops showed up, shot him.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.411
Shot him in the back and left him there.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.957
We're the ones drowning in this,
and they're shooting us?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.001
You know, I mean, we're--

17:23.544 --> 17:25.921
It's like we're not even human.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.923
I mean, we need help.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.260
We need help, and they are killing us.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.513
They're killing us like we are dogs.

17:35.347 --> 17:39.184
That's all we are to them.
We're not people, we're not humans.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.770
We're just dogs to them.

17:42.604 --> 17:45.107
We're dogs, and they are killing us.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.572
I'm sorry, sir. I can't take any more.

17:51.655 --> 17:55.325
I'm telling you, that's it.
I can't take any more people.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.452
People are gonna die
if you don't take them.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.913
The weight! I'm at capacity!

18:01.498 --> 18:03.041
I'm at capacity!

18:03.125 --> 18:06.378
-We have 200 people we need to evacuate!
-Hey. Hey!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.467
Quit arguing, okay?
They know their copters.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.554
You're just slowing them down.
Who are all these people?

18:16.430 --> 18:18.849
-They brought up patients.
-What are they still doing here?

18:18.932 --> 18:21.977
-This is dangerous. You need to clear--
-Hey! I'm in charge.

18:22.060 --> 18:25.230
Oh, yeah? I was in the Air Force.
A captain.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.608
I was trained to run a flight line.
Were you?

18:31.904 --> 18:34.656
-What do you want me to do?
-Get these people downstairs,

18:34.740 --> 18:35.991
and get the patients ready to go.

18:36.617 --> 18:39.536
All right. Everyone, who doesn't need
to be with a patient? Who does--

18:39.620 --> 18:40.913
Who doesn't need to be here?

18:40.996 --> 18:43.707
If you don't need to be here,
I need you off of the pad.

18:49.588 --> 18:52.424
The opening's not real big,
maybe three by three and a quarter feet,

18:52.508 --> 18:54.718
but it goes directly from the building
to the parking garage.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.304
-And we can get patients through?
-Should be able to.

18:57.387 --> 19:01.642
If we can, we can cut 15, maybe 20 minutes
off the trip up to the helipad.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.268
Find Karen. Show her the way.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.561
Yeah, you got it.

19:07.314 --> 19:11.193
We can't help you!
This is-- It's private property.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.569
Excuse me. I gotta get past.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.072
This is private property!
Go somewhere else!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.740
What are you doing?
Why aren't you helping?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.867
-Help us! You gotta help us!
-Keep back!

19:18.951 --> 19:20.285
How about the kids?

19:20.369 --> 19:21.453
Take the children.

19:21.537 --> 19:22.579
-Please.
-He's got kids!

19:22.663 --> 19:24.915
Brother, I'm tellin' ya. Stay back!

19:24.998 --> 19:26.875
-Come on, man, please!
-We shooting?

19:26.959 --> 19:28.418
-Brother.
-Just help.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.170
Charles, think about this. Come on!

19:30.254 --> 19:31.505
-Are we shooting?
-Please help us.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.340
-Stay where you are! I'm telling you.
-Please!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.424
Stay back!

19:56.947 --> 19:59.992
They're not here for us.
Come on. We're moving.

20:17.593 --> 20:18.594
Hold up.

20:19.595 --> 20:23.182
Charles. Charles, hold up.
Hey! What were you gonna do?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.100
You were going to shoot him?
Shoot his kids?

20:25.184 --> 20:26.602
What the fuck were you doing?

20:28.854 --> 20:30.063
What I was told.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.254
The fuck?

21:40.551 --> 21:42.344
Where the hell are they all going?

21:57.901 --> 21:59.236
Oh, shit.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.242
You are looking at
a live feed of Air Force One

22:05.325 --> 22:09.037
with President Bush on board,
doing what can only be described

22:09.121 --> 22:11.748
as a flyby of the city of New Orleans.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.544
President Bush is traveling
from Texas to Washington DC,

22:15.627 --> 22:17.087
but the White House has not yet confirmed

22:17.171 --> 22:19.423
if the president will visit
the affected areas,

22:19.506 --> 22:21.550
even as the city struggles
to rescue people.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.051
He's not even gonna land?

22:26.013 --> 22:27.639
He's not gonna do anything?

22:56.502 --> 22:57.669
Here we go. Easy.

22:59.296 --> 23:00.464
Okay, that's it.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.594
Okay, that's good. All right, let's go.

23:18.482 --> 23:19.483
Bring it in.

23:26.365 --> 23:27.616
I have one left.

23:27.699 --> 23:31.078
Mr. Scott, I'm Susan Mulderick.
How ya doing?

23:31.703 --> 23:32.871
Hot as hell.

23:32.955 --> 23:37.084
Yeah, well, we're trying to do
what we can with what we've got.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.879
Karen told you that we're getting
everybody out of the hospital?

23:40.963 --> 23:42.130
Yes, ma'am.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.675
Now, just as soon as we can,
we're gonna move you.

23:45.467 --> 23:49.346
If you're feeling any distress,
you let us know. Okay?

23:49.429 --> 23:51.473
Well, I'll be right here. That's for sure.

23:51.974 --> 23:52.975
Okay.

23:56.687 --> 23:59.231
Is he gonna fit
through that opening in that garage?

23:59.314 --> 24:03.277
I don't know. I don't think so.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.697
But we can't slow everything down trying.

24:07.281 --> 24:10.951
There's another patient at LifeCare.
Same thing. Morbidly obese.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.786
Probably about 300 pounds or so.

24:13.287 --> 24:15.789
They're gonna have to go last.
Both of 'em.

24:16.582 --> 24:19.209
But we're getting them out, right?
Susan?

24:20.919 --> 24:23.255
I don't know if I'm getting out.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.767
Hey, it's Vince.
Anna and I can't come to the phone.

24:35.851 --> 24:36.852
Leave us a message.

24:37.895 --> 24:41.440
Vince, I don't know
if you're getting these messages,

24:41.523 --> 24:44.026
but I want you to know that I'm okay.

24:48.238 --> 24:51.241
There's still no power.

24:53.076 --> 24:56.163
And we've got no help. There's nobody--

24:56.663 --> 24:59.708
Like, nobody's in charge.
Not at the hospital.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.044
Nobody at the city or the state.

25:03.837 --> 25:07.382
And people are dying.

25:08.258 --> 25:10.260
I just watched a patient die.

25:13.597 --> 25:17.017
I mean, he was suffering so much,
and we couldn't help him.

25:34.743 --> 25:39.164
Vince, my battery's almost gone.
I'll-- So I'm gonna turn my phone off.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.212
Will you leave me
a message when you get this one?

25:47.005 --> 25:48.215
Right, I love you.

26:31.175 --> 26:32.176
Yep.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.137
Okay, right-- Straight ahead.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.018
Susan.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.478
You need to talk to this man.

26:45.647 --> 26:49.151
Hi, I'm Mike Bowles. I'm from the state's
Department of Health and Hospitals.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.528
We're gonna get you all outta here.

26:51.612 --> 26:56.200
Our patient count has dropped
from 187 to about 130.

26:56.283 --> 27:00.120
Our general head count
is 460 Memorial employees,

27:00.204 --> 27:05.459
447 family members
and folks who were sheltering.

27:05.542 --> 27:12.257
There are also 53 LifeCare employees
and the same number of LifeCare patients.

27:12.341 --> 27:13.550
Those aren't our patients.

27:15.928 --> 27:18.430
I'm just acknowledging
that technically they're not our patients.

27:18.514 --> 27:19.723
We're running out of food.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.392
And we will be out of fresh water
by tomorrow.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.394
Okay, at the rate you're going,
realistically,

27:24.478 --> 27:26.438
there's no way
you're getting everybody out.

27:26.522 --> 27:28.982
You need to reorient your evacuation.

27:29.942 --> 27:31.527
Reorient how?

27:31.610 --> 27:34.112
Well, right now you're prioritizing
your sickest patients.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.280
They need the most help.

27:35.364 --> 27:38.242
They're the least ambulatory.
It's taking too long to move 'em.

27:38.325 --> 27:41.078
Patients who can get out,
who have the capacity to get out,

27:41.161 --> 27:43.038
those are the ones
you should be moving first.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.915
You all have triage armbands?

27:47.334 --> 27:48.418
Somewhere, yeah.

27:48.502 --> 27:50.963
Well, it should be standard kit.
Green, yellow, red, black.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.466
Have the doctors distribute the bands.

27:54.550 --> 27:58.303
Patients who are well enough to move
by themselves, give 'em green bands.

27:58.387 --> 28:00.305
Patients who need assistance,
yellow bands.

28:00.389 --> 28:03.475
Those who are completely dependent
on care, red bands.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.228
And the black bands?

28:07.271 --> 28:09.189
Anybody you think can't be saved.

28:10.774 --> 28:13.861
Now, this other hospital, LifeCare.

28:13.944 --> 28:16.238
If y'all are working together
on your evac,

28:16.321 --> 28:18.198
you need to have a standard procedure.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.827
Patients they think they might not
be able to save, give 'em black bands.

28:25.497 --> 28:29.376
We had considered patients
with do-not-resuscitate orders

28:29.459 --> 28:31.587
should be in whatever group goes last.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.757
If that's what you decided,
then they should all get black bands.

28:36.717 --> 28:40.053
So, that's how we're gonna decide
who lives and who dies?

28:40.137 --> 28:41.722
By colored armbands?

28:41.805 --> 28:45.309
Trying to save all your patients
means some that could've gotten out

28:45.392 --> 28:46.560
are gonna end up dying.

28:48.854 --> 28:50.272
Who are you with again?

28:50.355 --> 28:52.149
-Who is it--
-Department of Health and Hospitals.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.318
No, who is telling you
that this is the protocol

28:54.401 --> 28:56.069
we're supposed to be using right now?

28:56.153 --> 28:58.363
People are saying things,
he's saying things,

28:58.447 --> 29:00.949
the National Guard's saying things,
but we don't know who's in charge.

29:01.033 --> 29:04.119
You wanna know who's in charge? Nobody.

29:09.291 --> 29:12.211
So y'all need to figure out
how you're gonna help yourselves.

29:13.670 --> 29:16.590
Now, we're gonna start getting
boats in here as soon as we can.

29:17.299 --> 29:19.134
Probably not until the morning.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.346
Anybody that can move,
have them ready to go.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.488
Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.992
What happened? Everybody okay?

29:44.076 --> 29:46.912
I couldn't see where I was going.
I almost fell off the side.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.413
Are you okay?

29:48.497 --> 29:49.498
Yeah.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.918
Okay. You're okay.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.672
People are exhausted.

29:57.339 --> 29:58.757
They're starting to get careless.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.510
They need to rest.

30:03.345 --> 30:06.765
I really think we need to suspend
any evacuations for the night.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.228
You wanna stop?

30:11.311 --> 30:13.021
What else is gonna happen tonight?

30:13.105 --> 30:15.649
Well, I would hope to Christ
we get out of this hospital.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.068
There aren't any more trucks coming.

30:18.569 --> 30:20.112
The guy from the Health Department,

30:20.195 --> 30:22.990
he's not gonna have any boats
until tomorrow morning.

30:23.073 --> 30:24.783
Somebody almost fell off the helipad

30:24.867 --> 30:27.369
standing up there waiting
for helicopters that aren't coming.

30:28.829 --> 30:30.998
We keep at it,
somebody's gonna get killed.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.959
Patients are already dying.

30:34.042 --> 30:37.588
And trying to keep this up
all night with an exhausted staff--

30:37.671 --> 30:39.339
Does that help them or hurt them?

30:41.633 --> 30:45.804
Look, I'm only talking about a few hours.
Just until sunup.

30:51.393 --> 30:55.814
Y'all have worked long,
and y'all have worked real hard.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.525
But we can't keep it up.

30:59.484 --> 31:05.365
It is too dangerous to try to get patients
up to the helipad in the dark.

31:05.449 --> 31:09.119
So we are suspending the effort
for the night.

31:09.203 --> 31:10.537
No. Come on.

31:10.621 --> 31:14.041
Y'all should tell your people
to get as much rest--

31:14.124 --> 31:16.960
Susan, doesn't the Coast Guard
fly at night?

31:17.044 --> 31:20.881
Yeah, they do.
But It's too dangerous for us.

31:20.964 --> 31:23.926
Mistakes are being made,
and accidents are happening.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.886
So we can't keep going.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.804
-Y'all need to--
-Nobody's getting out.

31:27.888 --> 31:30.098
-As soon as it's light…
-I have a family.

31:30.182 --> 31:31.975
…we'll start moving things along.

31:32.059 --> 31:34.561
-When it gets light out…
-Look, nobody's getting outta here.

31:34.645 --> 31:36.355
…they have promised us boats tomorrow.

31:36.438 --> 31:37.814
Been here for three days.

31:37.898 --> 31:43.695
So when it gets light, we're gonna start
moving things right along. Okay?

31:43.779 --> 31:46.240
Carson, Carson, it's all right.

31:46.323 --> 31:49.576
-So y'all get some rest, and…
-We're all gonna get out of here. Come on.

31:50.911 --> 31:53.038
See you back here at sunrise.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.257
Go get some rest.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.112
Mom.

32:26.572 --> 32:27.573
Mom.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.784
There are boats coming in the morning.

32:31.368 --> 32:32.995
And I'm gonna get you on one of 'em.

32:33.078 --> 32:36.456
-We're leaving?
-I'm getting you on a boat.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.458
I'm not. No!

32:38.959 --> 32:41.795
-I'm not leaving if you're not.
-We are not gonna talk about this.

32:41.879 --> 32:45.340
We're not gonna argue.
You're getting on a boat.

32:45.424 --> 32:46.717
You're going.

33:09.948 --> 33:13.452
Boats are here.
Everybody, downstairs, now!

33:14.411 --> 33:15.662
Boats are here!

33:15.746 --> 33:18.957
Everybody, downstairs now!

33:19.458 --> 33:24.713
Everybody, downstairs! Up!
Everybody, downstairs!

33:24.796 --> 33:27.508
Come on. Up. Everybody, up!
Boats are here!

33:28.509 --> 33:34.556
Downstairs now! Take one bag!
No animals! Downstairs now!

33:34.640 --> 33:36.850
Take one bag. No animals!

33:36.934 --> 33:38.227
We gotta go.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.979
-What do we do with Rolfie?
-Just a bag.

33:41.063 --> 33:43.148
One bag. That's it.

33:47.569 --> 33:48.946
We've got to go.

33:58.288 --> 34:00.499
Take one bag! No animals!

34:02.501 --> 34:03.794
Everybody, up!

34:21.687 --> 34:23.522
I guess. But I don't know.

34:24.523 --> 34:26.817
-The city's decaying--
-Horace.

34:27.484 --> 34:29.235
-Yep.
-Horace, what's going on?

34:29.735 --> 34:30.737
I don't know.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.447
-Well, where are the boats?
-I don't know.

35:10.652 --> 35:12.696
Ma'am,
you really wanna head back inside.

35:15.032 --> 35:16.033
Ma'am!

35:39.014 --> 35:40.516
Anna, what's going on?

35:40.599 --> 35:41.934
There aren't any boats.

35:42.017 --> 35:44.144
-They said they were going to send--
-No boats.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.149
Everybody, listen up.

35:49.233 --> 35:50.234
Quiet.

35:50.943 --> 35:53.278
-No boats.
-What?

35:53.362 --> 35:54.863
There aren't any boats.

35:54.947 --> 35:58.700
Are you serious? Come on, man. Like…

36:31.358 --> 36:33.026
We were just gonna leave him.

36:39.658 --> 36:42.327
Ewing. Are all your things here?

36:43.161 --> 36:45.205
-What?
-Your belongings. Are they here?

36:49.126 --> 36:50.252
Minnie?

36:50.335 --> 36:52.045
-I think so.
-Yeah, yeah.

36:52.921 --> 36:56.258
Some of the staff, their things are gone.
Somebody took 'em.

36:57.176 --> 36:58.468
Took 'em when?

36:58.552 --> 37:02.306
When we were downstairs.
Waiting for boats that weren't there.

37:07.561 --> 37:09.479
Christ. Are these for real?

37:10.272 --> 37:13.692
They're collector's items.
Wasn't gonna leave 'em at home.

37:14.985 --> 37:16.987
They work. That's what matters.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.031
Look, do we need these?
We've got security guards.

37:19.114 --> 37:23.493
Clearly, they're not doing the job.
These are our patients, our families.

37:23.577 --> 37:24.912
We need to protect them.

37:31.168 --> 37:36.215
It's hot. It's always hot in here.

37:36.965 --> 37:39.468
You can't imagine how hot.

37:40.677 --> 37:45.766
We're running out of food and water.
And there's no medicine.

37:47.601 --> 37:49.895
The patients are moaning and crying.

37:50.687 --> 37:53.607
There's the constant sound of misery.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.319
And the toilets have stopped working.

37:57.402 --> 38:02.491
There's sewage everywhere.
You can smell waste and feces.

38:02.574 --> 38:06.245
And people are choking on it.
And people are dying.

38:07.579 --> 38:09.456
They're already starting to die.

38:11.959 --> 38:13.961
We can't take it much longer.

38:15.003 --> 38:19.508
We need help.
Mark, your mother needs help.

38:21.093 --> 38:22.719
You need to help us.

38:23.679 --> 38:28.642
You do something. Please, do something.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.898
Did you hear her? They need help.

38:34.982 --> 38:39.236
Memorial Hospital,
they need help, and they need it now.

38:40.737 --> 38:41.947
Are you there?

38:42.030 --> 38:44.616
At this time Memorial
is a secondary priority

38:44.700 --> 38:47.703
-for all rescue operations.
-Did you hear what she said?

38:47.786 --> 38:49.329
People are dying.

38:49.413 --> 38:53.125
Memorial Hospital
is categorized as a secondary priority.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.878
People are just standing around here.

38:55.961 --> 38:58.881
Nobody's doing a goddamn thing,
and you won't let us help.

38:59.756 --> 39:04.303
Do something! Do something!

39:04.386 --> 39:07.139
You need to get off
this line. Get off this line now.

39:18.734 --> 39:22.863
None of y'all gonna do anything?
You're not even gonna try?

39:26.158 --> 39:29.786
Mark. Mark!

39:31.538 --> 39:32.539
Mark.

39:32.623 --> 39:34.458
We can try to get to the hospital on foot.

39:34.541 --> 39:37.252
But the water's too high.
It'll be too toxic to swim in.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.338
We should get as close as we can,
then see if--

39:39.421 --> 39:44.426
Hey, hey, hey. Y'all wanna get
to the hospital? We'll get you there.

39:46.011 --> 39:47.763
-How?
-We've got some boats.

39:48.263 --> 39:51.225
We came to help people.
All they got us doing is nothing.

39:51.934 --> 39:54.603
If we get someplace to launch,
can you find the hospital?

39:55.229 --> 39:56.563
I know exactly where it is.

39:56.647 --> 39:59.483
-Was born there.
-Soon as it's light, we'll head out.

39:59.566 --> 40:01.693
No, we can go now.
Mark can find it with landmarks.

40:01.777 --> 40:04.738
No. Snipers all around the city
shooting at anything that moves.

40:05.364 --> 40:08.408
Now, we wanna help,
but we ain't gonna die doing it.

40:08.492 --> 40:12.538
-That's right.
-Soon as it's light, we'll head out. Okay?

40:14.498 --> 40:15.624
All right.

40:28.720 --> 40:32.683
There you go. It's okay.
I'll get you some.

40:35.602 --> 40:38.438
Okay, I'll be back
in just one minute. Yes?

41:30.657 --> 41:32.326
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:33.869 --> 41:36.413
-Let's see.
-Oh, Jesus. He's burning up.

41:36.496 --> 41:37.706
They all are.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.166
It's gotta be 105 in here.

41:50.052 --> 41:51.720
Been able to reach your husband?

41:57.392 --> 41:58.519
How's your family?

41:59.102 --> 42:03.857
They're okay. My daughter,
she wanted adventure, so…

42:09.112 --> 42:10.822
You should be getting some rest.

42:10.906 --> 42:12.366
I could say the same to you.

42:13.450 --> 42:15.536
Anna, you need rest.

42:20.457 --> 42:21.583
Look at this.

42:24.503 --> 42:25.712
How does this--

42:28.924 --> 42:33.136
This is something that happens
in a third-world country, not here.

42:33.887 --> 42:36.056
How do people let this happen here?

42:49.194 --> 42:52.322
-Did something happen?
-Yeah. It seems serious.

42:58.328 --> 43:00.247
You see what's happening?
You know what they're doing?

43:01.039 --> 43:02.291
I'm just trying to take care of patients.

43:02.374 --> 43:06.044
Hey, wait. Karen, we've got families,
folks, everybody coming to us for help,

43:06.128 --> 43:08.088
and all they're doing
is pushing people away.

43:08.589 --> 43:09.756
And you know why.

43:12.217 --> 43:15.512
They're scared. They got guns,
and they're scared of us.

43:16.388 --> 43:17.806
This isn't about us.

43:17.890 --> 43:20.392
The f-- Are you listening to the news?

43:21.143 --> 43:23.896
They're shooting us, Karen.
They're shooting us in the back.

43:23.979 --> 43:27.232
People in here are dying, and you wanna
bring more into the hospital?

43:28.108 --> 43:29.109
If you really cared about us,

43:29.193 --> 43:31.278
you wouldn't let anyone up
into this place.

43:31.361 --> 43:32.654
Not a single soul.

44:04.186 --> 44:05.854
Now I'm gonna have to wait.

44:06.647 --> 44:08.148
I can't.

44:13.445 --> 44:14.988
That will help you cool down.

45:23.891 --> 45:26.768
…are widespread outages
that could last for weeks

45:26.852 --> 45:29.313
in areas affected by the stor--

45:29.396 --> 45:32.065
…lot of areas
throughout the city covered with water.

45:32.566 --> 45:33.817
A lot of damage.

45:34.610 --> 45:37.112
-…martial law is in effect.
-…kind of damage.

45:37.196 --> 45:40.032
The entire top of the Superdome
has been peeled away.

45:40.115 --> 45:42.451
It literally looks like Beirut with water.

45:42.534 --> 45:44.161
It's what it looks like right--
