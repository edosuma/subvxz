Simone: In the winter of 1921

00:04.917 --> 00:07.398
on the coldest night of the
year, 8 women came together...

00:07.442 --> 00:09.183
On the campus
of Hawkins University

00:09.226 --> 00:12.316
to form a public service
organization dedicated to...

00:12.360 --> 00:14.579
The social, political,
and educational uplift

00:14.623 --> 00:17.365
of the Black community
and to the ideals of...

00:17.408 --> 00:20.020
Service, scholarship,
sisterhood.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.152
Greek alphabet. Go.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.545
Alpha, beta,

00:23.588 --> 00:26.026
gamma, delta, epsilon,

00:26.069 --> 00:29.638

theta...

00:32.031 --> 00:33.337
Aqueelah: Mm-hmm.

00:33.381 --> 00:36.819
Clearly, you poppyseeds need

00:36.862 --> 00:38.821
a little water to grow.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.826
Aqueelah: Melody
will send you details

00:43.869 --> 00:45.523
on the next set.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.786
Dismissed.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.533
I'm so sorry, you guys.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.188
It's all good,
girl. We'll just
keep studying.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.364
Yeah, 'cause one day,
we're gonna have a set

01:00.408 --> 01:02.627
where they can't
even touch us.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.199
Hey, girl.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.506
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:11.549 --> 01:14.335
I got caught up
running errands.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.293
You sure do have a lot
of errands this week.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.164
Some has kept you
out till 4 a.m.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.515
But I tell you, they are
putting a girl through it.

01:20.558 --> 01:23.213
Late-night sets,
assignments,

01:23.257 --> 01:24.997
no drip policy,

01:25.041 --> 01:27.609
and no one-on-one time
with the opposite sex.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.698
Ohh. I'm a fan
of that one.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.439
-Anyway...
-Heh!

01:31.482 --> 01:34.311
I'm here to help my girl
take down Nico Logan.

01:34.354 --> 01:36.313
Well, in that case,

01:36.357 --> 01:39.708
I should introduce
you to candidate
Nathaniel Hardin.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.363
You don't like it?

01:42.406 --> 01:45.801
Uh...

01:45.844 --> 01:48.282
I--the look.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.501
It's giving
"Politician Barbie."
I'm sorry.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.243
Simone, I'm just adjusting
to the world of politics.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.245
The Greeks
vote as a bloc,

01:55.289 --> 01:57.465
so if I win them over,
that's half the battle.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.336
Plus, I haven't really
found an audience yet,

01:59.380 --> 02:02.165
so I'm pitching myself at
Dr. P.'s pancake thing.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.820
All right, then.
Well, I will see you there.

02:04.863 --> 02:07.214
And don't forget, we are
dorm storming together
this weekend.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.216

any minute now.

the HBCU that's one year
removed from their
program being suspended

up for your session
at the Wellness Circle.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.542

05:25.586 --> 05:27.544
Honestly, the idea of
people talking about

05:27.588 --> 05:29.894
their feelings
in a circle is just
kind of ridiculous.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.070
I can't believe
Coach Loni is

05:32.114 --> 05:35.073
forcing me to attend
before I'm allowed
to compete.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.598
A lot of athletes
find it helpful,

05:37.641 --> 05:40.601
so let's just try
to keep an open mind, Thea.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.690
I mean, with
all due respect,
I have an open mind,

05:42.733 --> 05:45.909

is cutting into
my practice time.

y'all get changed,

have reached out.

must've got the heads-up

06:04.059 --> 06:05.930

used to this feeling.

from the top,
but we climbing.

-Yeah. Right there.

to enjoy the moment

06:27.474 --> 06:28.910

all right with him today?

going on with his pops.

earlier.

ever since.

talked about our days,

07:22.877 --> 07:24.444

07:24.487 --> 07:27.185
but we also listened
to each other.

your neutrality,

have a moment

08:06.616 --> 08:08.488
to hear my platform
for SGA president?

08:08.531 --> 08:10.098
Um, sure. Go ahead.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.752
I'm passionate about
student government,

08:11.795 --> 08:13.536
and I will apply that
passion by providing

08:13.580 --> 08:15.625
new avenues for students
to get their voices heard,

08:15.669 --> 08:17.322
towards increasing
funding

08:17.366 --> 08:18.933

and cultural groups.

did you know that

08:20.761 --> 08:23.720
12% of buildings
on campus don't have
wheelchair ramps?

08:23.764 --> 08:25.983
I did not know that.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.855
May I have a flyer?

08:27.898 --> 08:29.987

several. Take several.

are supporting Nico Logan

08:44.349 --> 08:45.786
in the president's race.

08:45.829 --> 08:49.224
What? But why Nico?

08:49.267 --> 08:51.269
Nate has a great
platform.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.402
Oh, Nico is
the devil we know.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.752
We backed him last year.
He made sure all of our
funding was approved.

I'm not sure who Nate
is trying to be
or what she's about.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.149
She just told you.

more access to students.

don't think I came here

09:05.153 --> 09:07.808
to ask for your opinion
on campus politics.

sisters a stack of
flyers and pamphlets.

these up all over campus.

not what you think.

it's not like that.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.517

on the tennis courts.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.519
Um...

20:59.562 --> 21:01.521
it's legit. Heh.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.870
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.353
OK. Well, if you'll
excuse me.

Marcus: Thea,
about your session.

21:09.616 --> 21:10.834
No, no, no, no. I'm not--

21:10.878 --> 21:12.183
I'm not in the mood
for this,

21:12.227 --> 21:13.620
especially not
here and now.

21:13.663 --> 21:16.536
Look, I went to
your session. I'm done.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.190
Look, I get it. I went
through the same thing
back in the day.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.497
You don't want
to talk about anything.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.804
I'm sure there's another
form of therapy that--

21:23.847 --> 21:26.285
I don't--I don't need
therapy.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.461

wants to sit in a room,

to distribute

21:47.393 --> 21:50.396

No offense, but the last
time I came to you
with a problem,

22:31.567 --> 22:33.308
you sent me to an empty room.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.747
You're right.
That was foul of me.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.358

my desperation.

can't answer the latter.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.169
I didn't do what I was
supposed to,

and not telling them.

your line sisters?

they'd have my back.

so much drama before
going on line anyway.

do with you than them?

with your line sisters

of women that you trusted,

that by taking a chance
on your line sisters.

33:50.463 --> 33:56.164
All this fabulousness
comes at a cost.

33:56.208 --> 33:59.124

to carve a path for
other students to follow.

an organization that's

more to say--

Look, look. I'm not
here to chew anyone out.

34:50.175 --> 34:53.047
All right. I called
this players' only meeting

34:53.091 --> 34:54.875
for two reasons.

34:54.918 --> 34:57.399
First is to tell you guys
that I'm sorry, all right?

34:57.443 --> 34:59.619
Now I realize that,
you know,

34:59.662 --> 35:01.316
my anger wasn't meant
for y'all.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.144
Look, real talk, fellas,

35:03.188 --> 35:04.841
in order for us to survive,
we gonna have to learn

35:04.885 --> 35:07.105
how to win and lose
the right way.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.497
Lando: He's right.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.325
And losing the right way
means

35:10.369 --> 35:12.110
showing our opponents
respect,

35:12.153 --> 35:14.199
even when they beat us.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.549
And winning the right way
means staying focused

35:16.592 --> 35:19.117
and not hot dogging
and letting the outside
noise derail us.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.727
Lando: What about
the inside noise?

35:20.770 --> 35:22.903
We got stomped
on our own field.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.861
That's not easy
to get over.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.385
You know, my pops
used to have

35:26.428 --> 35:28.213
this way of getting me
out of my head

35:28.256 --> 35:29.910
after a bad loss.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.391
He would say the best way
to get over ourselves

35:32.434 --> 35:34.044
is to think of other people.

35:34.088 --> 35:38.092
Yeah, my--my dad was flawed,
but, you know,

35:38.136 --> 35:39.702

And so you know what?

35:41.226 --> 35:43.010
That's exactly what we
gonna do, fellas.

35:43.053 --> 35:44.838
We gonna get
over ourselves,

35:44.881 --> 35:46.840
and which brings me
to the second reason
