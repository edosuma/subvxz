you will be a Sungjin woman

24:36.553 --> 24:39.233
though just in the namesake.

24:39.307 --> 24:41.774
And this is what it takes.

24:41.785 --> 24:44.361
That's when I made up my mind.

24:44.361 --> 24:49.228
That I would not let myself live
in squalor or darkness.

24:49.228 --> 24:54.122
That I would achieve success
and glory by any means.

24:54.122 --> 24:56.404
Always remember this.

24:56.404 --> 24:59.320
Your husband, Jun-hyeok, is a bastard

24:59.345 --> 25:02.624
between a lunch lady and a driver.

25:02.624 --> 25:04.912
And you should be thankful

25:04.912 --> 25:07.822
that you were only allowed
to set foot in my house

25:07.822 --> 25:09.942
because of his humble origin.

25:11.409 --> 25:16.929
Your environment will be different from
what you've experience until now.

25:16.929 --> 25:20.922
But there's only one thing
you really need to know.

25:20.922 --> 25:24.099
Make yourself useful.

25:24.099 --> 25:25.924
If you do that,

25:25.999 --> 25:30.441
I'll see to it that you'll live
a life without want.

25:31.527 --> 25:34.206
I decided that I would ever again

25:34.217 --> 25:37.230
rely on the charity of others

25:38.600 --> 25:42.044
or be an object of sympathy.

26:32.421 --> 26:34.332
Hello.

26:36.930 --> 26:39.016
It's me, Kim Yi-seol.

26:40.813 --> 26:42.979
Don't you remember me?

26:44.215 --> 26:47.707
Oh, we met before

26:47.707 --> 26:50.808
in front of the art center, right?

26:58.519 --> 27:03.231
It's the prenuptial agreement.
Please check the revisions.

27:03.231 --> 27:07.905
If you agree, we will send it to
our lawyers and make it official.

27:09.519 --> 27:11.237
And this is…

27:12.494 --> 27:16.396
[STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT]
for the shares that are to be
transferred to Master Hyeon-wu.

27:17.588 --> 27:20.544
[ASSIGNER: SEO HAN-SUK
BENEFICIARY: JUNG HYEON-WU]

27:20.544 --> 27:25.219
Mother, I will prepare Hyeon-wu's

27:25.272 --> 27:28.647
proof of paternity
as soon as I get out of here.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.940
There's no need.

27:32.506 --> 27:36.612
We're past such formalities now.

27:38.327 --> 27:40.731
Take good care of yourself.

27:41.894 --> 27:45.316
I'm glad that you're all right.

27:45.333 --> 27:49.346
I thought that
all my suffering had come to an end.

27:49.346 --> 27:52.601
Now that I had everything I wanted,

27:52.625 --> 27:56.008
I thought that I could live

27:56.008 --> 27:58.823
praying to God to give me

27:58.823 --> 28:02.111
the goodness and generosity to help
those less fortunate than I,

28:02.139 --> 28:05.195
just like my father's wealthy friend.

28:09.024 --> 28:12.056
But, how did you know she was here?

28:12.108 --> 28:15.601
I went to the art center

28:15.616 --> 28:17.698
in order to participate in a rehearsal.

28:17.723 --> 28:20.624
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Yun there.

28:28.193 --> 28:31.138
Mother, we need to talk.

28:31.208 --> 28:34.833
I don't want to repeat myself.
Ask your wife what happened.

28:36.045 --> 28:38.694
And mind your actions.

28:38.713 --> 28:40.314
Do you understand?

28:54.505 --> 28:57.624
Thank you for everything.
I'll show myself out.

29:04.419 --> 29:07.303
What are you so worried about?

29:07.303 --> 29:10.429
Do you think I've gone senile?

29:12.534 --> 29:14.821
I'm glad.

29:14.821 --> 29:18.320
I girl who isn't scared to die

29:18.320 --> 29:22.252
won't shy away from
any difficulties that come her way.

29:39.199 --> 29:40.784
Does it hurt, Mom?

29:40.784 --> 29:43.841
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

29:43.912 --> 29:47.209
So why do you still have
the needle in your arm?

29:47.217 --> 29:48.777
Don't you remember, Hyeon-wu?

29:48.819 --> 29:51.763
When you were in the hospital
because of a tummy ache,

29:51.763 --> 29:56.498
you had the same kind of needle
sticking out of your wrist.

29:56.598 --> 29:58.808
Oh, that's right.

29:58.808 --> 30:02.713
You have a tummy ache, Mommy?
What did you eat?

30:02.713 --> 30:05.139
Mommy has a tummy ache.

30:05.139 --> 30:08.925
She ate something really big.

30:08.925 --> 30:12.508
That's why Mommy has to
be here for three nights.

30:13.294 --> 30:15.810
Jeez, for three whole nights?

30:15.810 --> 30:19.004
You can sleep with Daddy
while Mommy's not home.

30:19.004 --> 30:21.026
How about you, Mommy?

30:21.026 --> 30:25.292
Are you going to sleep here
with that lady?

30:25.292 --> 30:29.388
No. She will go home to sleep.

30:34.301 --> 30:37.513
I brought the things
I thought you might need.

30:37.513 --> 30:39.500
Please call me if you need
anything else.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.183
It's all right.
I'm only here for a little while.

30:41.183 --> 30:42.973
Who'll take Hyeon-wu home?

30:42.973 --> 30:46.321
I have to drop by
the supermarket on my way home.

30:46.321 --> 30:48.424
You take her home, honey.

30:48.424 --> 30:51.255
It's all right.
If you could just take Hyeon-wu home…

30:51.255 --> 30:54.916
Go on ahead.
I'll take him home with me.

30:54.916 --> 30:56.742
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

30:56.742 --> 30:59.507
Hyeon-wu, I'll see you at home.

30:59.507 --> 31:03.620
- Don't forget about my chocolate milk!
- OK.

31:03.620 --> 31:04.935
Goodbye.

31:04.935 --> 31:06.605
Bye.

31:08.104 --> 31:09.897
Having fun?

31:15.899 --> 31:18.526
Hyeon-wu, you want to go
buy some chocolate milk?

31:18.526 --> 31:21.290
- Really?
- There's a convenience store downstairs.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.984
Why don't you ask Daddy to buy you some?

31:22.984 --> 31:24.923
Daddy!

31:24.923 --> 31:29.332
Huh? Chocolate milk?

31:29.332 --> 31:32.448
You want to go get some?
Let's go!

31:32.448 --> 31:35.888
- We'll be right back.
- Ok.

31:43.008 --> 31:45.324
Chocolate milk!

31:47.404 --> 31:50.386
Two cartons?
Mommy won't like that.

31:50.386 --> 31:51.913
Let's just get one, okay?

31:51.913 --> 31:54.506
Are you all right, Yi-seol?

31:55.334 --> 31:58.927
You seem uncomfortable
around my husband.

31:58.927 --> 32:00.440
Pardon?

32:00.440 --> 32:04.779
My husband has lots of female fans.

32:04.779 --> 32:08.520
He was the most popular guy on campus.

32:08.520 --> 32:14.531
All the girls hated me because they wanted to be with him.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.436
Don't worry.

32:24.894 --> 32:27.436
I'm not that kind of girl.

32:30.823 --> 32:34.888
I am interested

32:38.096 --> 32:39.923
in Mr. Jung.

32:43.336 --> 32:47.608
But I'm even more
interested in you, Mrs. Yun.

32:48.710 --> 32:53.146
As I already told you,
I wanted to impress you.

32:55.617 --> 33:00.833
I'm interested in your husband
because of one thing.

33:02.001 --> 33:08.709
I'm just curious about the man that you chose.

33:10.617 --> 33:12.507
That's it.

33:36.312 --> 33:37.393
What is all this?

33:37.393 --> 33:40.875
Mrs. Lee instructed me…

33:40.875 --> 33:43.161
Where is she now?

33:47.027 --> 33:50.344
First, we'll publish an article
about someone abusing Propofol*.
(ILLEGAL DRUG USED BY THE WEALTHY)

33:50.344 --> 33:53.943
Then, we'll publish an article
implying that it is Mrs. Yun.

33:53.943 --> 33:56.512
Then, the public relations department
at Sungjin

33:56.512 --> 34:00.704
will publish an article
denying the drug abuse.

34:00.704 --> 34:05.813
Afterward, if the two get divorced,

34:05.813 --> 34:07.718
everyone will assume

34:07.718 --> 34:10.190
that it's because
of Mrs. Yun's addiction.

34:10.190 --> 34:12.592
Let's proceed like this.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.273
- How about the chairwoman?
- I'll tell her.

34:15.273 --> 34:16.987
Okay.

34:18.149 --> 34:20.145
Mother?

34:20.145 --> 34:22.418
I didn't think you'd come here today.

34:22.418 --> 34:25.719
What are you doing here, Ju-yeon?

34:25.719 --> 34:28.678
The exhibition will soon be starting.

34:38.567 --> 34:40.014
[YUN JAE-HUI ACCUSED OF PROPOFOL ABUSE]

34:40.014 --> 34:42.570
[S CORPORATION FAMILY MEMBER
ADDICTED TO PROPOFOL]

Unbelievable!

34:49.996 --> 34:52.456
Chief editor of the Hanju Daily!

34:52.456 --> 34:54.081
Yes, Madam?

34:54.889 --> 34:57.707
Chief editor Choi Hui-jun!

35:01.596 --> 35:05.633
- Yes, Madam?
- Did you study abroad on
a scholarship from the Sungjin Group

35:05.633 --> 35:08.206
so that you could drink all night?

35:08.206 --> 35:10.871
Your lack of sober judgment
makes me think

35:10.871 --> 35:13.427
that it's time for you to quit.

35:13.427 --> 35:16.628
How dare you do
something like this without my consent?

35:16.628 --> 35:19.706
I'm sorry, Madam. Please forgive me.

35:20.829 --> 35:22.456
A daughter-in-law is nothing!

35:22.456 --> 35:26.548
She's family only
as long as she's married to my son!

36:07.300 --> 36:09.638
How is the investigation
into Sungjin Bio going?

36:09.638 --> 36:13.505
Mr. Kim, the VP of Strategy
is going to take the fall.

36:16.339 --> 36:20.896
It's a sad fate to be a prosecutor
in this country, isn't it?

36:22.626 --> 36:26.809
Anyway, if they pass
the Insurance Business Act,

36:26.809 --> 36:29.398
Sungjin Life will have to sell
the Sungjin Electronics shares

36:29.398 --> 36:31.384
that it owns.

36:31.384 --> 36:33.561
What will happen to Jung Jun-il then?

36:33.561 --> 36:35.971
If Sungjin Trade
can't buy those shares,

36:35.971 --> 36:38.718
he won't be able to
take control of the company.

36:39.910 --> 36:41.464
We need to know

36:41.464 --> 36:46.609

in order to prepare.

36:46.609 --> 36:49.723
How are you enjoying the food?

36:50.396 --> 36:53.446
Think of this as your home
and make yourself comfortable.

36:53.446 --> 36:56.612

37:01.005 --> 37:02.715

my position in Gang-hyeon's life.

37:47.921 --> 37:50.886

That's good.

37:53.568 --> 37:57.034

now that you've had chocolate milk?

37:57.034 --> 37:59.262
Yeah!

37:59.262 --> 38:02.301

until Mommy comes home.

Who is it?
That woman?

38:20.846 --> 38:22.555
That woman?

38:25.437 --> 38:27.630
You mean, Kim Yi-seol?

38:28.398 --> 38:29.963
Why?

38:31.975 --> 38:33.923
I heard that she will be
narrating the exhibition.

38:33.923 --> 38:35.348
Yeah.

38:35.348 --> 38:38.616
She seemed really young.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.715
She's different than she looks.

38:40.715 --> 38:43.290
And she's not some young floozy.

38:43.290 --> 38:46.029
She has a strong sense of ethics.

38:46.029 --> 38:48.938
What's that supposed to mean?

38:50.236 --> 38:52.430
Will you look at the time?

38:52.430 --> 38:54.023
It's time to put Hyeon-wu to bed.

38:54.023 --> 38:57.718
Hyeon-wu, say goodnight to Mommy.
It's time to go.

38:59.005 --> 39:00.743
Goodnight, Mommy.

39:00.743 --> 39:03.869
Goodnight, Hyeon-wu. I love you.

39:05.515 --> 39:08.425
Call me if you need anything.

39:08.425 --> 39:09.428
Okay.

39:20.399 --> 39:22.610
I'll call you later.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.448
I'm recuperating after surgery.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.596
Honey!

39:42.202 --> 39:44.317
Honey!

39:47.128 --> 39:48.693
What does

39:51.338 --> 39:55.303
"recuperating" mean?

40:00.713 --> 40:02.278
Who said that?

40:02.278 --> 40:04.818
I was texting Jae-hui

40:04.818 --> 40:10.220
and she texted,
"I'm recuperating after surgery."

40:10.220 --> 40:12.722
I know what surgery is.

40:13.090 --> 40:16.414
But what does "recuperating" mean?

40:16.414 --> 40:22.562
That means that she's recovering her health.

40:22.562 --> 40:25.929
But, why did she have surgery?

40:25.929 --> 40:28.306
I don't know.

40:28.306 --> 40:30.437
Hey, where are you going?

40:30.437 --> 40:34.898
I'm sorry, sir.
I left something in the office.

41:10.430 --> 41:14.033
Why did you come out?
You could have used the call button.

41:14.033 --> 41:16.019
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

41:16.019 --> 41:19.100
Please call me if you need anything.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.278
Of course.

41:30.812 --> 41:33.871
- Hello?
- Where are you?

41:35.123 --> 41:36.288
I'm home.

41:36.288 --> 41:40.400
Is it all right
to talk to me from home?

41:40.400 --> 41:44.897
I don't see why not.
I've done worse.

41:45.622 --> 41:49.798
Are you all right?

41:50.727 --> 41:53.432
Why wouldn't I be all right?

42:05.612 --> 42:08.238
Were you with Cho Gang-hyeon?

42:08.238 --> 42:10.300
Who was it?

42:11.917 --> 42:14.232
Who did this to you?

42:17.091 --> 42:19.444
I'm the new CEO of the art center.

42:19.444 --> 42:24.348
And I finally received
Hyeon-wu's shares of Sungjin Trade.

42:27.190 --> 42:29.663
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

42:29.663 --> 42:33.844
You think it's just a result
of my dirty ambition?

42:37.391 --> 42:40.922
I'm going to continue to contact you.

42:40.922 --> 42:44.658
And I'm going to keep
asking for your help.

42:48.335 --> 42:50.963
I'm not going to apologize
for yesterday, either.

42:50.963 --> 42:53.708
I've made enough apologies
for a lifetime.

42:54.602 --> 42:57.731
If you don't like it,

42:57.731 --> 43:00.019
you can do what you want.

Hi.

47:55.812 --> 48:00.120
I heard that tonight
will be your final newscast.

48:00.120 --> 48:03.837
I saw the article that you'll be
the next Secretary of Civil Affairs.

48:05.329 --> 48:09.642
People will write anything
that they want nowadays

48:09.642 --> 48:10.903
without even checking their sources.

48:10.928 --> 48:14.573
And it spreads like wildfire.

48:15.357 --> 48:17.646
People will only see

48:17.646 --> 48:21.645
what they want to see
and believe what they want to believe.

48:21.645 --> 48:23.520
Isn't that so?

We're having the rehearsal
for the exhibition narration.

- Great.

Hello, Jae-hui.

49:49.449 --> 49:51.070
What are you doing here?

49:51.070 --> 49:55.468
Didn't you hear that
the narrator's been changed?

49:59.928 --> 50:01.106
Are you very busy?

50:01.106 --> 50:04.454
The opening of the exhibition
is just around the corner.

50:04.454 --> 50:07.934
It would have been nice
if you'd called ahead.

50:07.934 --> 50:10.224
I see.

50:10.224 --> 50:13.027
I was thinking
it was like old times, I guess.

50:14.329 --> 50:18.454
We met for the first time
seven or eight years ago, right?

50:18.454 --> 50:21.418
It's been so long
that I can hardly remember.

50:21.418 --> 50:23.938
I must be growing old.

50:24.619 --> 50:27.954
I wanted to talk to you

50:27.954 --> 50:31.360
the last time I was here.

50:37.936 --> 50:40.951
It was exactly 10 years ago.

50:40.951 --> 50:44.367
I was in charge of protocol
at the Biennale

50:44.367 --> 50:46.753
while you were
at the Ministry of Culture.

50:46.753 --> 50:49.410
That's right.

50:49.410 --> 50:54.751
I guess my memory can't be
as good as someone so young.

50:56.124 --> 51:01.346
You were quite old even then.

51:05.151 --> 51:07.733
I was young and foolish,

51:07.733 --> 51:11.135
so I asked you to put me in charge

51:11.135 --> 51:12.621
of the new artist's exhibition.

51:12.621 --> 51:14.540
Oh my.

51:15.419 --> 51:19.336
You certainly had the skills
for the job.

51:19.336 --> 51:22.314
Why didn't you get it?

51:22.944 --> 51:25.057
Isn't it obvious?

51:25.057 --> 51:29.147
I couldn't bring myself
to go to bed with a dirty old man.

51:30.251 --> 51:32.611
You even gave me your hotel key

51:32.649 --> 51:36.652
to help me get the job.

51:36.653 --> 51:39.355
It was quite unfortunate.

51:44.032 --> 51:48.058
I'm sure you're aware that
you are no longer the narrator.

51:48.058 --> 51:52.678
I'll send you an invitation
so come back at the opening.

51:53.449 --> 51:55.357

struggle with the object,

Painter Sun Sang-gi was born
on November 14th, 1945.

53:14.965 --> 53:19.072
He was born on an island near
Yeosu in Jeollanam-do.

53:19.072 --> 53:21.207
Due to his weak constitution,

53:21.207 --> 53:26.418
he only started elementary school
at the age of ten.

53:26.418 --> 53:29.467
But his talent was recognized early on,

53:29.467 --> 53:32.670
so he attended both middle
and high school on an art scholarship.

Yi-seol, I think this
is just about finished…

56:30.350 --> 56:32.826
that lived in this place.

56:37.038 --> 56:39.153
How about you?

What do you think
when you see this painting?

I'm curious.

56:48.749 --> 56:50.847
It…

56:52.741 --> 56:55.373
pains me.

56:55.373 --> 56:58.114

56:59.957 --> 57:03.430
That white dirt road

57:03.430 --> 57:08.053
seems to harbor a sadness
whose tears have dried up.

57:09.543 --> 57:13.570
But also, it tells us not to be sad,

57:14.954 --> 57:17.513
that someone is still here,

57:21.138 --> 57:24.044
that people are still living here.

that knows what happened that day.

I'm sure they're fine.

They're probably living in some city

01:01:28.468 --> 01:01:32.220
in cozy homes of their own.

about the woman in the video.

who used to live with No Yeong-ju.

a woman is so vindictive.
