02:01.809 --> 02:04.687
Today is a good day to die.

02:06.489 --> 02:10.640
- What's happening?
- It's crack. Get some help.

02:10.809 --> 02:13.881
Crackheads take up all our time.

02:14.529 --> 02:18.124
- What have we got?
- Hemmorage.

02:18.289 --> 02:25.400
- Vaginal bleeding.
- Probably a street abortion.

02:25.569 --> 02:29.721
- We've got to open her up.
- All the O. R.'s are full.

02:29.889 --> 02:34.405
- We can't wait. I'll operate.
- You can't!

02:34.569 --> 02:39.359
Just do it! Get him out of here.

02:42.209 --> 02:46.168
15 years on the job and you're
gonna get me canned in one day.

02:46.329 --> 02:49.401
Here we go.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.480
Forceps!

02:51.649 --> 02:54.641
Where is it? Clamp!

02:54.809 --> 02:59.360
- You got her.
- All right, I've got her.

02:59.529 --> 03:02.202
Dave, get out of here. Now!

03:03.449 --> 03:08.682
Labraccio!
What the hell are you doing?

03:26.089 --> 03:30.640
Randall Steckle,
"Diary of a Surgeon." No.

03:30.809 --> 03:35.678
Randall Steckle,
"Diary of a Surgeon to be."

03:35.849 --> 03:39.398
Randall Steckle,
"Making of a..."

03:39.569 --> 03:43.801
"Forging of a Surgeon."
No, pretentious.

03:43.969 --> 03:48.440
Randall Steckle, "Genesis"?

03:49.129 --> 03:55.159
"Genesis of a Young Surgeon."
Brilliant!

04:10.809 --> 04:13.528
Morning.

04:14.169 --> 04:18.401
Nice work. Keep it up.

04:23.249 --> 04:25.729
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

04:25.729 --> 04:29.358
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

04:30.169 --> 04:33.639
Like, from above, looking down.

04:34.489 --> 04:39.119
Ralph, my husband, was crying.

04:39.289 --> 04:43.328
The doctor was saying I was dying.

04:43.489 --> 04:47.641
I saw myself in the bed
and everything.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.918
I started to float out
into the hall.

04:52.089 --> 04:58.642
Then into this tunnel
toward this light.

05:00.249 --> 05:03.878
It was the most beautiful light
I ever saw.

05:04.049 --> 05:08.008
I heard this voice.

05:08.169 --> 05:13.038
It was the most beautiful voice
I ever heard.

05:13.209 --> 05:16.565
And it said:

05:16.729 --> 05:20.358
"I'm going to take your baby."

05:22.969 --> 05:26.484
"But you are going back."

05:27.329 --> 05:34.485
And I woke up, and there
was Ralph and the doctor.

05:34.649 --> 05:40.918
I was legally dead
for 41/2 minutes.

05:41.089 --> 05:45.685
But I didn't see no tunnel
and I didn't see no light.

05:45.849 --> 05:50.001
I did... and it was so beautiful!

05:50.169 --> 05:54.560
- I was in this garden...
- This tunnel and this light...

05:54.729 --> 06:00.361
Then this guide...
and a chariot and music.

06:00.529 --> 06:04.761
Terry, I think they'd better
get you off medication.

06:06.169 --> 06:08.842
Thanks.

06:11.169 --> 06:14.366
- What's up?
- Good morning.

06:14.529 --> 06:18.124
There's trouble in E. R.
You'd better watch your ass.

06:18.289 --> 06:21.838
Why are you always asking
the patients about death?

06:22.009 --> 06:25.684
I'll be late for class.
Thanks, Edna.

06:27.169 --> 06:33.438
The spoils of arthritis. Some rather
resilient inflammatory tissue here.

06:33.609 --> 06:40.082
We're now under the transverse arch
of the foot. The metatarsals...

06:40.249 --> 06:45.039
Brilliant, Dr. Steckle. Bring all
that talent with you tonight.

06:45.209 --> 06:51.205
Nelson, about tonight. I like you.
I have to decline on moral grounds.

06:51.369 --> 06:56.841
There enough atrocity in the world
without your own little horror.

06:57.009 --> 07:02.288
It's ignorance we fear. When did
truth and knowledge become a horror?

07:02.449 --> 07:07.125
Especially to a scientist
and a genius like yourself.

07:15.129 --> 07:18.758
- How are you doing, Mannus?
- Fine.

07:19.449 --> 07:23.078
I've been meaning to ask you,
are you dating anyone?

07:23.249 --> 07:27.037
- Identify.
- Costodiaphragmatic recess.

07:27.209 --> 07:30.087
Is it offensive
if I make conversation?

07:30.249 --> 07:35.243
Sometimes it's nice to open up.
Like old Lenny here, he's open.

07:35.409 --> 07:39.197
- Identify.
- Pylorus.

07:39.369 --> 07:43.078
I've heard all the rumours and
nicknames about you, Rachel.

07:43.249 --> 07:48.118
I'm sure you're a very warm woman.
Not in the least bit repressed.

07:50.529 --> 07:53.043
- Identify.
- Your brains.

07:54.649 --> 07:58.164
You want to come over to my place?

07:58.329 --> 08:04.962
Dr. Hurley,
I need a word with Dr. Mannus.

08:05.129 --> 08:09.042
- I already said no to this.
- Steckle and Hurley are in.

08:09.209 --> 08:12.201
Two of the top
GPA's in the school.

08:12.369 --> 08:15.600
I need you to handle the injections
and the I.V.

08:15.769 --> 08:20.240
I have no interest
in watching you kill yourself.

08:20.409 --> 08:23.003
I think you do.

08:23.169 --> 08:27.606
Good morning, class.
Today's exam will be scaled.

08:27.769 --> 08:31.125
Three A's will be given,
five B's and ten C's.

08:31.289 --> 08:34.280
The remaining four
will get D's and F's.

08:35.609 --> 08:41.844
As in life, you're competing not
with me, yourself or this exam, -

08:42.009 --> 08:45.763
- but with each other.

08:45.929 --> 08:50.286
There are a lot of others who'd
like to make a name for themselves.

08:50.449 --> 08:54.920
It's a shame that the people with
the ability don't have the nerve.

08:55.089 --> 08:58.968
- All right, we'll be there.
- Speak for yourself, Joseph.

08:59.129 --> 09:03.600
Sure, it'll be dramatic, Nelson.
You'll cry or faint, puke at best.

09:03.769 --> 09:07.648
But then what?
I don't think you have the balls.

09:07.809 --> 09:12.439
You just bring the equipment.
I'll bring my balls.

09:12.609 --> 09:14.725
Did you hear about Labraccio?

09:18.369 --> 09:22.044
Dave, it's a four-month suspension.
It won't affect your scholarship.

09:22.209 --> 09:24.598
Forget it, I'm out of here.

09:25.729 --> 09:31.122
You're the best they've ever had.
They won't let you walk away.

09:31.289 --> 09:35.601
- Besides, you were wrong.
- No, damn it! She was dying.

09:35.769 --> 09:38.886
I saved her life.
What would you have done?

09:39.049 --> 09:45.238
They have to make an example out of
you to protect their insurance bond.

09:45.409 --> 09:47.718
They'll take you back next term.

09:47.889 --> 09:51.086
It doesn't matter.
I'd do the same thing again.

09:51.249 --> 09:56.403
I know you would.
That's why I need you there tonight.

09:56.569 --> 10:00.562
There are a few people I'd like
to kill, but you're not one of them.

10:00.729 --> 10:04.358
I don't want to die.

10:04.529 --> 10:09.967
I want to come back with the answers
to death... and life.

10:10.129 --> 10:12.563
I can get there with the others...

10:12.729 --> 10:18.599
...but I need you.
I need you to bring me back. Please.

10:21.129 --> 10:25.566
I'm sorry, man, I can't do that.

10:26.169 --> 10:31.448
Just walk away, Dave.
Go climb a mountain.

10:31.609 --> 10:35.921
I don't understand you any more.
You burn your career on a stranger.

10:36.089 --> 10:39.445
Now you turn your back
on a friend.

10:49.609 --> 10:54.399
Look, I'm real sorry
about what happened today.

10:55.569 --> 11:01.405
- I won't make it back without you.
- So don't do it.

11:11.849 --> 11:14.682
Dave...

11:15.649 --> 11:19.324
What if it works?

11:50.769 --> 11:53.647
I don't want to be buried
on Saturday.

11:53.809 --> 11:58.485
It costs $150 more
to be buried on Saturday.

12:00.049 --> 12:03.405
Mrs. Amsler,
you're doing much better.

12:46.729 --> 12:49.562
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

12:49.729 --> 12:51.447
<i>I know you're home.</i>

12:51.609 --> 12:55.284
- <i>Don't be late. Bring the camera.</i>
- What camera?

14:07.529 --> 14:11.761
- Thank God he called a specialist.
- No lectures, okay?

14:11.929 --> 14:14.648
You're engaged. Grow up.

14:14.809 --> 14:19.599
I'm recording a few last adventures
before resigning myself to monogamy.

14:19.769 --> 14:24.889
I didn't realise. I thought
you were just a pussy marauder.

14:27.609 --> 14:32.444
What the hell are we doing here?
This is goodbye med-school.

14:32.609 --> 14:36.397
Ten bucks says he shits his drawers
and we're out of here.

14:36.569 --> 14:40.881
Not those lights.
Security will come running.

14:41.049 --> 14:44.724
Set up over the grate.
I just got the boiler going.

14:44.889 --> 14:48.928
- You're really going to do this?
- Just humour the man.

14:49.089 --> 14:53.287
Take me down with nitrous,
sodium pentathol and a cold blanket.

14:53.449 --> 14:55.917
I've got some chilled D5W.

14:56.089 --> 15:01.641
When my temperature is 86°,
hit me with 200 joules.

15:01.809 --> 15:05.848
The shock will stop my heart.
Then take my mask off.

15:06.009 --> 15:10.127
- You said Rachel was coming.
- Steckle, shut the door.

15:10.289 --> 15:13.725
You handle the injections.

15:13.889 --> 15:18.041
When the EEG flatlines, the brain
is dead. I'll be exploring.

15:18.209 --> 15:23.806
Give me 30 seconds. Set the blanket
to warm and take me up to 93°.

15:23.969 --> 15:28.918
Inject 1 cc of adrenalin,
and Joe, come in with the defibs.

15:29.089 --> 15:33.446
- You bring me back to life.
- With brain damage.

15:34.889 --> 15:39.007
Resembling in many ways...
a Cabbage Patch doll.

15:39.169 --> 15:43.242
Not with a body temperature of 86°.

15:45.489 --> 15:49.767
Dr. Mannus,
will you handle the injections?

15:54.489 --> 15:58.687
Wait a minute. Quite simply,
why are you doing this?

15:58.849 --> 16:01.886
To see if there's anything
beyond death.

16:02.049 --> 16:04.927
Philosophy failed. Religion failed.

16:05.089 --> 16:09.879
Now it's up to physical science.
Mankind deserves to know.

16:10.049 --> 16:12.882
You're doing this for mankind?

16:13.049 --> 16:17.008
This letter absolves you
of any responsibility.

16:17.169 --> 16:20.844
This isn't for mankind.
You want to get on "60 Minutes" -

16:21.009 --> 16:24.638
- sandwiched between Andy Rooney
and the commercials.

16:24.809 --> 16:29.519
"Tonight, a medical student who
experienced death and came back."

16:29.689 --> 16:34.205
- Fame is inevitable.
- That's the wrong reason.

16:34.369 --> 16:39.841
Dr. Hurley, electrodes. Don't you
want to be on "60 Minutes"?

16:43.329 --> 16:49.040
Rachel, how about a little nitrous?
At least I'll go out with a laugh.

16:51.209 --> 16:55.282
Dr. Hurley, get the blanket.

16:58.489 --> 17:02.801
We're all professionals.
I'm sure this'll go very smoothly.

17:02.969 --> 17:05.801
Can I have your apartment?

17:05.969 --> 17:09.483
- It's a joke!
- One minute.

17:09.648 --> 17:14.483
Don't be late. Start filming now.

17:14.648 --> 17:18.005
You'll have a complete record
of the experiment.

17:18.169 --> 17:22.162
Promise me
you'll go through with this.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.282
One little kiss goodbye.

17:32.449 --> 17:36.078
I'll see you soon.

17:44.569 --> 17:48.278
- 96°.
- This letter doesn't mean shit.

17:48.449 --> 17:54.524
Let him sleep. He'll have a wet
dream and think he went to heaven.

17:54.689 --> 17:59.558
- Now I know why I'm here.
- I've stated my feelings, goodbye.

17:59.729 --> 18:04.439
Are you willing to risk your future
for Nelson's fame?

18:06.449 --> 18:09.122
Someone's coming!

18:13.169 --> 18:16.878
- Is he dead?
- He's only sleeping.

18:17.049 --> 18:19.609
Talk some sense into these people.

18:19.769 --> 18:24.240
I'll do it.
I've got nothing to lose.

18:24.409 --> 18:27.367
- Just his life!
- I can get him back.

18:27.529 --> 18:32.080
- Just stop his heart for a minute.
- Don't think I couldn't have.

18:37.689 --> 18:40.567
No!

18:40.729 --> 18:44.563
- Clear.
- What are you doing?

18:44.729 --> 18:48.244
- A systole.
- You're killing him.

18:48.409 --> 18:52.527
- No wonder you got tossed.
- Stop this shit.

18:52.689 --> 18:58.480
I did not come to medical school
to murder my classmates!

19:01.529 --> 19:05.408
Flatline.

19:08.569 --> 19:12.164
They're getting smaller. He's dying.

19:12.569 --> 19:17.199
- Brain death. Now it's real.
- Start filming.

19:17.369 --> 19:22.318
He's dead, isn't that enough?
Let me try to bring him back.

19:22.489 --> 19:28.928
- Just watch the door.
- We're in the room with a dead man.

19:29.089 --> 19:34.959
- One minute to go.
- Start filming!

20:14.329 --> 20:17.878
- 30 seconds to go.
- Okay, let's heat him up.

20:39.609 --> 20:44.967
- 20 seconds. 89°, 90°...
- Sodium bicarbonate ready.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.765
I'm charging the paddles.

20:55.329 --> 20:59.004
Monitor the EKG.

21:02.289 --> 21:05.486
- Body temp: 93°.
- Here we go.

21:10.849 --> 21:14.478
- What have we got?
- Not a goddamn thing.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.766
Up me to 300.

21:25.529 --> 21:27.759
Begin CPR.

21:27.929 --> 21:32.764
Sodium bicarbonate and eppy.

21:32.929 --> 21:36.126
My God!

21:41.889 --> 21:44.847
Not a goddamn thing!

21:45.009 --> 21:48.888
- 98°.
- Hit him again. 350.

21:51.289 --> 21:54.167
Nothing.

21:58.169 --> 22:01.047
Got him!

22:01.209 --> 22:04.565
- Steckle, help me.
- More eppy.

22:06.649 --> 22:09.766
In.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.848
We got REM.

22:30.129 --> 22:35.283
- Nelson, can you hear us?
- Welcome back, man.

22:35.449 --> 22:42.002
- The crazy motherfucker did it!
- Jesus Christ!

22:42.169 --> 22:47.289
Steckle, that's some bedside manner.
You'll make one hell of a doctor.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.407
Suck me.

23:42.689 --> 23:46.887
Can you recall any specific emotion?
Heat, cold, anything like that?

23:47.049 --> 23:51.725
- You can't be specific.
- Did you see a tunnel of light?

23:51.889 --> 23:57.407
No, but there is something
out there. It's comforting.

23:57.569 --> 24:00.766
Have you any idea how big this is?

24:00.929 --> 24:05.127
He could use some air.
You guys could get us some fluids.

24:05.289 --> 24:10.238
- Thanks for saving my life.
- It was so much fun.

24:11.769 --> 24:17.844
- How do you feel, wise one?
- Like a highly-tuned instrument.

24:18.009 --> 24:21.684
Can you hear the traffic
on the lake shore?

24:23.769 --> 24:30.004
Underneath that there's a hum.
It's the street lights.

24:31.689 --> 24:37.719
Even fainter... I can hear
a kind of dragging sound.

24:38.929 --> 24:42.888
- And it's getting louder.
- No.

24:44.129 --> 24:47.758
I not only hear it, I can feel it.

24:48.969 --> 24:54.646
Yeah, your prognosis is excellent.
You'll be great on "60 Minutes".

24:54.809 --> 25:00.566
- It's bigger than that, David.
- I'm sure you'll see to that.

25:01.209 --> 25:05.919
- You're not buying any of this.
- You forgot... I'm an atheist.

25:07.289 --> 25:10.884
Are you all right for a few minutes?

25:17.809 --> 25:17.889
- How's he doing?
- He thinks he's back from the dead.

25:17.889 --> 25:23.407
- How's he doing?
- He thinks he's back from the dead.

25:23.569 --> 25:27.926
- That's what we did, right?
- All we did was get lucky.

25:28.089 --> 25:33.686
- I would like to go next.
- Yeah, I'd like to be famous, too.

25:33.849 --> 25:38.001
- It's not about fame.
- They'll build monuments to you.

25:38.169 --> 25:42.321
- Small stone ones. "Rest in Peace."
- I'm going next.

25:42.489 --> 25:46.243
I'd be willing to go
1 minute 20 seconds.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.324
1:30.

25:50.489 --> 25:56.007
Are you two so competitive that
you're willing to bet your lives?

25:57.209 --> 26:00.406
1:30.

26:00.569 --> 26:05.359
That's it then. Not a bad price
to pay for fame and glory.

26:05.529 --> 26:09.238
Die to be a hero,
but don't die to be a celebrity.

27:03.209 --> 27:06.201
Champ?

27:15.609 --> 27:20.524
- Someone ought to stay with him.
- I will.

27:20.689 --> 27:23.601
Are you okay?

27:23.769 --> 27:27.239
I'd like to go home.

28:02.929 --> 28:08.401
Are you okay?
You were hyperventilating.

28:10.849 --> 28:13.761
Your blood pressure will rise -

28:13.929 --> 28:19.686
- as your
cardiovascular vessels constrict.

28:20.369 --> 28:25.727
- God, you're beautiful.
- Get some rest.

28:28.969 --> 28:33.008
I bet 24 hours ago you didn't think
you'd be spending the night here.

28:33.169 --> 28:39.608
You were lucky last night, Nelson.
Don't push it.

28:43.449 --> 28:45.679
ENGAGEM ENT PARTY

28:49.369 --> 28:54.204
<i>I want to wish you two</i>
<i>the best of everything together.</i>

29:03.689 --> 29:06.601
Hello,
may I please speak to Anne Coldren?

29:10.289 --> 29:12.928
Anne?

29:13.089 --> 29:16.559
<i>Hi, I've been thinking about you.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

29:16.729 --> 29:19.448
Counting the days
to Thanksgiving break.

29:19.609 --> 29:24.888
I've got to transfer to a school
closer to you or get a faster car.

29:25.049 --> 29:29.839
- We should've married last summer.
- <i>My mother wasn't ready yet.</i>

29:30.009 --> 29:33.479
You know, you're the best.

29:34.849 --> 29:36.726
If anything happens...

29:36.889 --> 29:41.644
- Joe, what's wrong?
- <i>I don't know. I'm just tired.</i>

29:41.809 --> 29:45.848
I'm not making any sense.
I should go.

29:46.009 --> 29:50.878
- Joe, you're scaring me.
- It's okay, nothing's wrong.

29:51.049 --> 29:54.166
I love you. Bye.

31:16.569 --> 31:20.847
- Nothing.
- Starting CPR.

31:23.729 --> 31:28.644
- CPR and adrenalin, and nothing!
- What's going on? Come on, Joe!

31:30.529 --> 31:34.158
- Come on, Nelson, let me try.
- We're running out of time!

31:35.929 --> 31:39.604
- Let me try.
- I'm doing everything I can!

31:39.769 --> 31:43.444
- Nelson, step back.
- Come on, Joe!

32:28.409 --> 32:32.004
I got him. Oxygen.

32:33.969 --> 32:37.120
0xygen ready.

32:39.769 --> 32:43.205
CPR successful. Hurley lives.

32:43.369 --> 32:46.805
It's okay, Joe.

32:52.689 --> 32:56.238
- It was great.
- Here it comes.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.479
Define "great".

32:58.649 --> 33:03.882
I don't know, it's not thinking
about the past or the future.

33:04.049 --> 33:09.681
- It's difficult to explain.
- Yeah, dying is funny that way.

33:09.849 --> 33:13.762
Nelson's right, there
definitely is activity beyond death.

33:13.929 --> 33:18.002
- Absolutely.
- The experience was strange.

33:18.169 --> 33:22.799
- It was almost erotic.
- He's dead and he gets laid.

33:22.969 --> 33:26.120
What do you mean, erotic?

33:26.289 --> 33:30.202
I don't want you to think
it was wantonly sexual.

33:30.369 --> 33:33.441
No, that never
would have occurred to me.

33:33.609 --> 33:39.127
It was friendly. It was something
vaguely feminine guiding me.

33:39.289 --> 33:43.919
This could be the conquest of our
generation. The last great frontier.

33:44.089 --> 33:49.083
First you had the sea, then
America, the West, the Moon...

33:49.249 --> 33:51.558
...Mr. Leary, drugs,
the inner journey...

33:51.729 --> 33:55.039
Our former First Lady
and the outer journey...

33:55.209 --> 33:58.121
- But this is ours!
- We did have disco.

33:58.289 --> 34:03.841
- Fuck the baby boomers.
- Watch your mouth.

34:04.009 --> 34:09.686
- <i>I</i> found something. Remember?
- I came back from the dead tonight.

34:09.849 --> 34:13.159
It doesn't surprise me.
We had Elvis in here last night.

34:16.248 --> 34:20.003
Pay when you're ready, okay?

34:21.248 --> 34:26.766
- Was it difficult getting back?
- Not that I remember.

34:26.929 --> 34:32.719
But you remember everything else?
I think you guys are full of shit.

34:32.889 --> 34:38.646
- I'm not buying any of this.
- I wouldn't buy it either...

34:38.809 --> 34:42.438
...unless I'd been there.
So what about it, Dave?

34:42.609 --> 34:48.400
- An atheist has nothing to lose.
- I'm going next.

34:48.569 --> 34:54.438
Nobody's going next. You're looking
for answers where there are none.

34:54.609 --> 35:01.003
You just saw what you wanted to see.
Give it up. It's too dangerous.

35:01.169 --> 35:06.687
We can't turn back now.
I'm going further. 1:50.

35:07.809 --> 35:12.280
Two minutes...
I changed my mind. Two minutes.

35:12.449 --> 35:15.282
- 2: 10.
- 2:20.

35:17.729 --> 35:20.197
It looks like we found a winner.

35:26.609 --> 35:29.681
Enjoying yourself, Nelson?

35:39.369 --> 35:42.327
Joe...

35:43.369 --> 35:47.965
Was there anything negative
about your experience?

35:48.129 --> 35:51.519
No. Nothing.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.204
Good.

35:57.369 --> 36:04.161
- Hold on.
- Was that your idea of chivalry?

36:04.329 --> 36:09.244
- Were you trying to show me up?
- Not everything is about you.

36:09.409 --> 36:14.244
Nobody seems to want me to go under.
I don't need your protection.

36:14.409 --> 36:17.401
What do you need, Mannus?

36:17.569 --> 36:21.323
What do you think I need?

36:21.489 --> 36:28.201
When someone is as smart and driven
as you are, and very beautiful, -

36:28.369 --> 36:31.839
- it makes the rest of us
very nervous.

36:33.169 --> 36:37.606
- Why did you change your mind?
- I'm the sceptic on this.

36:37.769 --> 36:45.642
If I see there's nothing out there,
there's no reason for us to go on.

36:45.809 --> 36:49.518
How do you explain
the similarity in death experiences?

36:49.689 --> 36:54.285
People from different cultures see
the same things in the same order.

36:54.449 --> 37:00.684
Maybe there's a hormone released
by the brain at the time of death.

37:00.849 --> 37:06.481
No, you're reaching. What if you go
and there is something out there?

37:07.769 --> 37:12.524
- Then you can kill yourself, too.
- I'm not going to kill myself.

37:12.689 --> 37:19.003
I'm glad to hear that, Mannus.
I might miss you.

37:20.809 --> 37:25.360
- So why this obsession with death?
- It's just an interest.

37:25.529 --> 37:30.557
A personal interest. Goodnight.

37:30.729 --> 37:35.325
- Can I drive you home?
- No, thanks.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.288
I didn't take the money.

38:40.449 --> 38:44.408
I got the toaster, but too many
appliances make you love me.

38:44.569 --> 38:46.480
Right, Nelson?

38:46.649 --> 38:52.884
In the end,
we all know what we've done.

39:14.889 --> 39:17.562
Champ?

40:00.089 --> 40:03.559
Come here, Champ.

40:04.609 --> 40:07.442
Come here, boy.

40:13.689 --> 40:16.886
What are you doing here, kid?
Are you all right?

40:18.929 --> 40:21.124
Are you okay?

40:21.289 --> 40:23.280
Are you lost?

40:44.569 --> 40:48.642
Halloween morning.
Rotting pumpkins, burning leaves, -

40:48.809 --> 40:52.245
- black cats
mating like rats in the alley.

40:52.409 --> 40:57.005
It were as if we felt no fear.

40:57.169 --> 41:02.482
As if we were already dead,
and had nothing to lose by dying.

41:02.649 --> 41:08.918
Because we lived life so well,
and loved life so much, -

41:09.089 --> 41:11.603
- we imagined ourselves immortal.

41:11.769 --> 41:17.366
Overwhelming the powers that be
with our passion for science.

41:17.529 --> 41:20.202
Or maybe we were fucked in the head.

41:22.169 --> 41:26.720
Hey, I'm Joe Hurley.
You're Terry, right?

41:26.889 --> 41:32.282
- You had a near-death experience.
- I don't want to talk about it.

41:32.449 --> 41:38.843
Wait a minute.
I had a near-death experience also.

41:40.129 --> 41:46.477
I need someone to talk to.
This thing changed my life.

41:47.289 --> 41:52.238
- At first, they didn't believe me.
- What the hell do they know?

41:52.409 --> 41:59.440
If you have to go to class, maybe we
can discuss it one night this week?

41:59.609 --> 42:03.727
All that day I knew
something was going to happen.

42:03.889 --> 42:09.441
I've always had premonitions.
Once, my aunt was to fly...

42:17.329 --> 42:20.480
<i>Why did you do this to me, Joe?</i>

43:45.089 --> 43:46.602
No!

43:47.489 --> 43:51.164
Trick or treat.

44:31.609 --> 44:37.286
It's Halloween. There's a full moon.
Aren't we pushing it a little bit?

44:38.969 --> 44:44.123
I'm sorry I'm late.
I ran into some very big guys.

44:44.289 --> 44:48.362
- Let me take a look at it.
- I'm fine.

44:49.369 --> 44:54.124
- Where the hell have you been?
- I don't feel well. Look at you.

44:54.289 --> 44:57.759
Just worry about your camera.

44:57.929 --> 45:01.126
Nice outfit.

45:02.129 --> 45:04.643
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

45:05.449 --> 45:09.408
Who are you supposed to be?
Boner Man?

45:10.089 --> 45:15.038
- 2:20, don't forget.
- You just hurry up and get back.

45:15.209 --> 45:18.167
You can buy us breakfast.

45:18.329 --> 45:21.765
Don't let go of the rope.

45:23.249 --> 45:26.286
<i>Hoka hey.</i>

45:26.449 --> 45:29.441
See you soon.

45:37.449 --> 45:41.044
20 cc's sodium pentathol in.

45:43.489 --> 45:47.164
- 86°.
- 200 joules charged.

45:50.329 --> 45:53.048
Clear.

45:56.889 --> 46:00.086
Flatline.

46:47.129 --> 46:52.601
What hangs in the air palpably?
Is it hope, or the fear of death?

46:52.769 --> 46:56.728
- Shut up, Steckle.
- No, you shut up!

46:58.489 --> 47:02.038
What if he didn't make it back?

47:03.169 --> 47:06.525
Would you miss him, Rachel?

47:08.289 --> 47:10.644
One minute.

47:26.769 --> 47:30.205
- 90°.
- Give him another five seconds.

47:30.369 --> 47:35.443
- Why not ten? We've got the time.
- Are you serious?

47:35.609 --> 47:39.443
<i>Joey, I trusted you.</i>

47:40.609 --> 47:44.397
- Stations. Joe, move yourself.
- Come on, no kidding around here.

47:44.569 --> 47:47.447
Who's kidding?

47:48.849 --> 47:52.558
- What's going on here?
- 92°.

47:53.569 --> 47:56.402
Joe, get it!

47:56.569 --> 48:02.439
Come on. 2: 15, 2: 16, 2: 17, 2: 18...

48:02.609 --> 48:05.840
2:20. Hand it over.

48:06.009 --> 48:09.081
This is my lab. 300 joules.

48:11.529 --> 48:14.566
Charged. Clear.

48:27.289 --> 48:29.962
Breathe!

48:30.129 --> 48:35.362
- 1,000, 2,000... What comes next?
- Knock it off, Nelson!

48:35.529 --> 48:41.684
- 5,000. Breathe.
- 300 joules charged. Clear.

48:42.569 --> 48:45.208
Come on, Dave.

48:55.649 --> 48:59.278
- That's it!
- That's not it. It's a v-fib!

48:59.449 --> 49:03.920
- Try lidocaine.
- Not yet.

49:04.089 --> 49:08.879
- Come on, Dave.
- Raise it to 360. Clear.

49:09.049 --> 49:12.883
- Try lidocaine.
- Three fucking minutes.

49:13.049 --> 49:18.521
Starting CPR. Joe, keep filming.
I'm going to bring him back.

49:20.169 --> 49:23.764
<i>You lied to me, Joe.</i>

49:33.129 --> 49:37.281
- We've got him.
- 1 mg eppy in.

49:37.449 --> 49:44.366
That was close.
That was way too close.

49:45.209 --> 49:48.485
- <i>Hoka hey.</i>
- What did you say?

49:48.649 --> 49:53.928
<i>Hoka hey.</i> It's the war cry
of the Sioux Indians. It means...

49:54.089 --> 49:59.766
"Today is a good day to die."
So was it, Dave?

49:59.929 --> 50:04.400
I don't know if I was dead.
I may have felt something.

50:04.569 --> 50:08.926
A dream... or just a bunch of stuff
stored up inside my mind.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.762
You were brain-dead.

50:11.929 --> 50:15.683
Some electrical current
circulating through my body...

50:15.849 --> 50:22.402
It would've shown up on the EEG.
You were dead. So what happened?

50:24.249 --> 50:27.844
It's hard to verbalise.

50:28.009 --> 50:31.763
It's like being paranoid
without the fear.

50:31.929 --> 50:36.081
Like being watched.
You guys were standing over me.

50:36.249 --> 50:40.720
- Who could be watching?
- They're dead.

50:40.889 --> 50:44.802
The sceptic did feel something.
I'm going again.

50:44.969 --> 50:49.520
- No way! I've been bumped twice.
- Four minutes.

50:49.689 --> 50:53.523
- Labraccio went for 3:50.
- That was a mistake.

50:53.689 --> 50:58.319
- Under four minutes is pointless.
- Nobody is going for four minutes!

50:58.489 --> 51:02.198
- 4:25.
- 5 minutes.

51:02.369 --> 51:08.001
- I'm next or I'm out for good.
- It'll be hard without her.

51:08.169 --> 51:11.844
- But without me...
- Or me.

51:16.849 --> 51:19.807
Well, mutiny at last.

51:22.609 --> 51:28.844
I trusted you with a brilliant idea.
It was the chance of a lifetime.

51:29.009 --> 51:34.845
- Give it a rest, Nelson.
- None of you had my foresight!

51:35.009 --> 51:41.687
Rachel, you want to go next?
Be my guest, but this was my idea!

51:41.849 --> 51:43.840
You're tourists!

51:47.369 --> 51:51.601
I would've gone 3:30 or 3:40.
I still might.

51:51.769 --> 51:57.366
But 4:25 is crazy. We're pushing the
five-minute mark. It's dangerous.

52:00.809 --> 52:03.004
<i>You shit, Joe.</i>

52:03.169 --> 52:06.400
<i>You said you loved me, Joe.</i>

52:09.769 --> 52:12.681
- <i>I love you, Joe.</i>
- Buddy?

52:12.849 --> 52:17.525
Skelator, are you listening to me?

53:24.929 --> 53:27.124
Thanks for staying.

53:27.289 --> 53:33.478
I'm on the early shift.
You seem fine. I'll see you later.

53:33.649 --> 53:36.880
- About tonight...
- Don't try to talk me out of it.

53:37.049 --> 53:39.165
Why are you doing this?

53:39.329 --> 53:44.483
I've lost people
that are close to me.

53:44.649 --> 53:49.723
I want to make sure they've gone
to a good place. Is that so trivial?

53:49.889 --> 53:54.440
To tell you the truth, it's the best
reason I've heard yet for going.

53:54.609 --> 53:58.727
There's something
I didn't tell you about last night.

53:58.889 --> 54:06.523
I had this feeling
that if I had gone any further...

54:06.689 --> 54:12.047
...that there was something out
there protecting me. Something good.

54:12.929 --> 54:18.720
- So you don't need to go under.
- The atheist now believes in God?

54:18.889 --> 54:24.407
I'm trying to tell you
that I don't want you to do it.

54:26.009 --> 54:32.357
Think about all we'll have to talk
about... when you bring me back.

54:34.129 --> 54:35.329
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

54:35.329 --> 54:38.958
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

54:41.809 --> 54:44.403
Mrs. Amsler, you've fought well.

54:44.569 --> 54:49.848
- Sometimes we just have to let go.
- That's what the voices say.

54:50.009 --> 54:55.800
- What voices?
- They say, "Have you done enough?"

54:55.969 --> 54:59.086
"Have you told everyone
you love them?"

54:59.249 --> 55:02.525
I have.

55:02.689 --> 55:09.925
They're friendly voices. They're
telling you what you need to know.

55:10.089 --> 55:15.243
- What?
- That you have someplace to go.

55:16.249 --> 55:21.039
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.

55:26.329 --> 55:29.207
Yes, I do.

56:11.249 --> 56:14.639
Hey, fellatio!

56:16.729 --> 56:20.847
Got a match? Well, I do.

56:21.009 --> 56:23.921
Your face and my ass.

56:24.089 --> 56:27.877
- Your breath and a buffalo fart.
- Do I know you?

56:28.049 --> 56:32.486
You don't know jack shit!
Butt-wad, needle-dick, cock-bite, -

56:32.649 --> 56:35.163
- jack-off, limp-wrist, -

56:35.329 --> 56:40.642
- banana-breath, shit-bird,
bird-turd, turd-face, -

56:40.809 --> 56:44.927
- kiss-ass, brown-nose,
macho-wimp, limp-dick!

56:45.089 --> 56:50.209
What's the matter? Gonna cry?
Cry-baby Davie.

56:50.369 --> 56:54.806
Shit-faced, rat-turd,
ass-licking, son of a bitch.

57:11.849 --> 57:16.445
- How did it happen?
- I was playing hockey.

57:16.609 --> 57:18.998
- About last night...
- It's okay.

57:19.169 --> 57:22.923
- No-show Labraccio.
- That's not like him.

57:23.089 --> 57:28.527
- It's his way of trying to stop me.
- It's not a good idea to continue.

57:28.689 --> 57:32.648
- We don't need David.
- Can you do this?

57:32.809 --> 57:38.645
- Can you trust me?
- No, but let's do it anyway.

57:38.809 --> 57:41.687
Nitrous on.

57:44.529 --> 57:47.441
See you soon.

58:02.329 --> 58:07.608
How long's she been under?
We're bringing her back.

58:07.769 --> 58:12.889
- She hasn't been under long enough.
- Just do it, Joe.

58:13.049 --> 58:15.882
Don't expect any kisses for this.

58:57.769 --> 59:04.845
- Aborting fourth experiment. Why?
- Why don't you ask Dr. Death?

59:05.009 --> 59:09.161
- What's going on?
- We're bringing Rachel back early.

59:09.329 --> 59:15.086
- Drop it. Think about Rachel.
- Joe's right. 91 °. Let's be ready.

59:49.209 --> 59:53.043
Rachel, don't go in there.

59:53.209 --> 59:56.918
<i>I</i> told you not to do that.

59:57.569 --> 59:59.764
Denny!

01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:03.437
It's your fault!

01:00:09.129 --> 01:00:13.042
- Nothing.
- Take me up to 300.

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:16.042
Come on, Rachel.

01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:39.921
300 joules. Clear!

01:00:40.089 --> 01:00:42.808
- Got her! .
- V-fib. We don't have her.

01:00:42.969 --> 01:00:46.439
- It's okay, we'll get her.
- Step me up to 360.

01:00:48.369 --> 01:00:53.489
- What did you do to me?
- A short, maybe a circuit.

01:00:54.009 --> 01:00:57.684
- Joe, you charged the battery?
- Shit!

01:00:57.849 --> 01:01:01.808
Starting CPR. Bag her, Steckle.

01:01:05.209 --> 01:01:07.677
No pulse.

01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:38.158
- It's not working. Joe, take over.
- She's been under 4 minutes.

01:01:40.249 --> 01:01:45.084
We're moving to bretylium.
It's the only way.

01:01:45.249 --> 01:01:48.446
Don't do it, you'll fry her.

01:01:51.689 --> 01:01:54.078
Nelson!

01:01:54.809 --> 01:01:58.165
Please, don't!

01:02:03.409 --> 01:02:06.958
You'll bring her back?

01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:12.962
Come on, Mannus.

01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:17.440
Lidocaine in.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:21.363
Come on back to us. Come on.

01:02:23.529 --> 01:02:27.442
Wait!

01:02:29.009 --> 01:02:32.319
I heard something.

01:02:33.769 --> 01:02:37.125
Oxygen!

01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:43.599
She's back.

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:58.803
- Why did you stop us?
- Something happened to me today.

01:02:58.969 --> 01:03:02.928
There was a girl... Winnie Hicks.
I went to school with her.

01:03:03.089 --> 01:03:05.922
We used to make fun of her.

01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:12.085
On the train, she started calling
me names. Right in front of me!

01:03:12.249 --> 01:03:17.482
- She was still only ten years old.
- Maybe you fell asleep.

01:03:17.649 --> 01:03:22.643
- No, it was not a dream.
- I've seen some odd things, too.

01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:26.643
- I thought it was brain damage.
- In your case it probably is.

01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:29.767
Shut that off, Steckle,
this is personal.

01:03:29.929 --> 01:03:34.400
I've been haunted by images of women
that I secretly videotaped.

01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:39.723
They're all members
of the Joe Hurley Video Library.

01:03:39.889 --> 01:03:43.848
What about you, Nelson?
Who's come looking for you?

01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:49.520
His name's Billy Mahoney.
He's a kid we picked on in school.

01:03:49.689 --> 01:03:54.240
- It's no big deal.
- Then what happened to your face?

01:03:54.409 --> 01:03:58.800
- The little guy gets carried away.
- Wait a minute.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:04.168
I can understand Dave nodding off,
and pervert here having flashbacks.

01:04:04.329 --> 01:04:10.882
You're saying this guy physically
touches you. That is not possible!

01:04:11.049 --> 01:04:14.724
- This is too weird.
- Weird? We've experienced death.

01:04:14.889 --> 01:04:18.598
Now somehow we've brought
our sins back physically.

01:04:18.769 --> 01:04:23.524
- When did you know about this?
- After Joe went.

01:04:23.689 --> 01:04:29.685
- But you didn't say a word!
- Jesus Christ! We're scientists.

01:04:29.849 --> 01:04:35.048
It's reckless, immoral and unethical
for you to withhold your findings.

01:04:35.209 --> 01:04:38.997
Rachel Mannus may have the answers
to life and death.

01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:42.639
She was under for five minutes!

01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:47.519
If she walks out of that
ladies' room with those answers, -

01:04:47.689 --> 01:04:50.761
- the whole world will worship her.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:56.845
- Just like you do.
- You should've told us, Nelson.

01:04:57.009 --> 01:05:01.685
- You wouldn't have done it.
- At least we'd have had a choice!

01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:11.606
We're fucked.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:17.842
- Rachel, are you all right?
- I'm okay.

01:05:26.609 --> 01:05:33.208
I said I was fine.
Are you guys gonna watch me?

01:06:42.849 --> 01:06:47.445
Come on, Billy Mahoney.

01:06:47.609 --> 01:06:50.487
Give it your best shot.

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:56.842
I dare you... I fucking dare you.

01:06:57.649 --> 01:07:04.487
- Things from our past want revenge?
- I'm not exactly sure how it works.

01:07:04.649 --> 01:07:11.248
But if you see anything,
I want you to talk to me about it.

01:07:11.409 --> 01:07:15.084
You can tell the doctor.

01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:21.597
- I'll be in the living room.
- Is it people we've hurt?

01:07:21.769 --> 01:07:25.284
Did something happen tonight?

01:07:26.289 --> 01:07:28.325
No.

01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:33.198
Just try and get some rest.

01:07:37.689 --> 01:07:42.126
- How's she doing?
- I think she's hiding something.

01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:45.520
- What did Nelson do to that kid?
- I don't know!

01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:50.638
- We must keep each other informed.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:55.929
Why don't you guys take off?
I'll stay with her. I'm sorry.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.924
We're gonna get you, Billy Mahoney!

01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:40.246
No!

01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:44.002
Stop, Nelson!

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:17.238
- How are you doing?
- I'm late. I'll see you later.

01:09:17.408 --> 01:09:23.404
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I've got to stop her.

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:26.162
Good morning, Rachel.

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:30.319
No... no...

01:09:31.488 --> 01:09:36.926
Her voices were wrong.
There's nothing beautiful out there.

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:41.879
- Losing them is part of our work.
- But I was wrong.

01:10:45.129 --> 01:10:48.565
You look like
you're enjoying the day.

01:10:50.489 --> 01:10:55.768
- Don't you remember me, Joe?
- Yes, of course.

01:10:55.929 --> 01:11:01.845
- Are you a model? You could be.
- Look, I've got to go.

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:06.287
I'm not picking you up.
I just picked you out.

01:11:06.449 --> 01:11:09.521
Mind if I buy you a drink?

01:11:09.689 --> 01:11:14.160
- I'll call you this weekend.
- Fine, I'm in the book.

01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:22.238
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Who are you?

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:27.358
- What are you doing?
- Some crazy girl... Do I know you?

01:11:27.529 --> 01:11:31.966
Would you like to?
We don't have to do anything.

01:11:32.129 --> 01:11:36.327
We can just lie together.
Hold each other in our underwear.

01:11:42.569 --> 01:11:45.527
I'll call you. I promise.

01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:49.568
I'm tired of playing the field.

01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:53.005
We can stop whenever you want.

01:11:54.489 --> 01:11:57.686
It'll only
make our relationship better.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:02.521
I've never felt like this before.

01:12:05.409 --> 01:12:09.038
Of course I respect you.

01:12:15.449 --> 01:12:20.477
- Call me whenever you want.
- Show me that you love me.

01:12:20.649 --> 01:12:23.925
You're not real!

01:12:28.329 --> 01:12:31.446
Anne, is that you?

01:12:34.329 --> 01:12:39.357
- Is it really you?
- You sounded so upset on the phone.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:44.603
- I was worried. I took the bus.
- What a great surprise.

01:12:45.369 --> 01:12:50.397
- How long have you been here?
- Long enough to see your tapes.

01:12:51.809 --> 01:12:54.926
My God!

01:12:55.089 --> 01:13:01.039
You're gonna think I'm leaving you
because you slept with those girls.

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:03.928
They meant nothing to me.

01:13:04.089 --> 01:13:09.322
I wish they had meant something.
If you had cared for any of them, -

01:13:09.489 --> 01:13:12.162
- I could have fought that.

01:13:12.329 --> 01:13:16.481
But to film all those girls...
To have so little respect...

01:13:16.649 --> 01:13:22.758
Those women trusted you.
You have no understanding of trust.

01:13:24.569 --> 01:13:29.085
- It's not what you think.
- Yes, it is.

01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:30.729
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

01:13:30.729 --> 01:13:33.562
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:38.405
Do you have a daughter Winnie,
about 26 years old?

01:13:38.569 --> 01:13:44.087
You do? I'm David Labraccio.
I was in school with Winnie.

01:13:44.249 --> 01:13:47.446
Yeah, my parents still live there.

01:13:47.609 --> 01:13:51.682
I wanted to get in touch with her
and I was wondering...

01:13:55.529 --> 01:13:59.044
Okay. Do you have her address?

01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:03.485
Great. I really appreciate it. Bye.

01:14:11.449 --> 01:14:15.567
- Jesus!
- It looks as bad as it feels?

01:14:15.729 --> 01:14:20.564
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No. How's Rachel doing?

01:14:20.729 --> 01:14:25.405
She didn't come out of that bathroom
with the answers to life and death.

01:14:25.569 --> 01:14:30.165
Where are you going?
Can I go?

01:14:30.329 --> 01:14:37.326
- It's a two hour drive.
- I don't want to be alone.

01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:44.762
You will remove the left kidney
and dissect the lower intestines.

01:14:44.929 --> 01:14:50.845
Remove the ascending colon
from the transverse colon.

01:14:51.009 --> 01:14:56.367
Proceed to the sigmoid colon
and on to the appendix.

01:14:58.769 --> 01:15:03.206
- Where the hell are you going?
- Are you okay?

01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:09.365
I would be fine if everyone would
stop asking me if I'm all right.

01:15:12.409 --> 01:15:16.527
- Is she getting the heebie-jeebies?
- I'm spooking, too.

01:15:16.689 --> 01:15:20.728
Getting us kicked out of med-school
won't get Anne back.

01:16:10.409 --> 01:16:12.127
Mannus!

01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:18.159
I'll handle this. Back to work
or suffer the consequences.

01:16:18.329 --> 01:16:20.445
Fuck it.

01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:32.563
- This must be it.
- Winnie did well for herself.

01:16:32.729 --> 01:16:37.849
- She won't even remember you.
- It's worth a shot.

01:16:38.009 --> 01:16:41.206
- Are you coming?
- No.

01:16:41.369 --> 01:16:47.558
Listen, if anything happens...
If you need me, just honk the horn.

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:19.367
Ring, ring, ring.
Dave, you should've sent a letter.

01:17:19.529 --> 01:17:22.680
Anybody home?

01:17:27.769 --> 01:17:33.127
- Hi, is your mother at home?
- Coming.

01:17:35.369 --> 01:17:38.167
Go in the house, baby.

01:17:38.809 --> 01:17:44.884
- Yes? Can I help you?
- Yeah, I think you can.

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:49.759
Are you Winnie Hicks?
From Claremont?

01:17:49.929 --> 01:17:55.765
I'm David Labraccio.
We went to school together.

01:17:55.929 --> 01:17:59.524
I was a little smaller then.

01:18:00.929 --> 01:18:04.319
I just drove up from the city.
That's my truck.

01:18:06.729 --> 01:18:10.005
Hello, I'm nice. He's nice.

01:18:10.169 --> 01:18:14.401
We're both fucking lunatics.
Can I come in, please?

01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:22.524
I've got to hand it to you, Dave...
you've got guts.

01:19:00.729 --> 01:19:05.564
This is beautiful.
You've done well for yourself.

01:19:05.729 --> 01:19:09.324
Well, it isn't medical school.

01:19:09.489 --> 01:19:13.243
But I never liked school anyway.

01:19:13.409 --> 01:19:16.845
I wasn't very good at it.

01:19:17.009 --> 01:19:21.366
- I'm surprised you remember me.
- I do remember you.

01:19:21.529 --> 01:19:25.317
I also remember the way
we treated you back then.

01:19:25.489 --> 01:19:31.883
You were a little shy, and I was
a real jerk... and I'm sorry.

01:19:32.049 --> 01:19:38.966
What are you talking about? That was
so long ago I don't even remember.

01:19:39.129 --> 01:19:42.087
Let's not dredge up all that stuff.

01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:49.121
However we made you feel...
it was wrong. We were wrong.

01:19:51.409 --> 01:19:54.003
Go on.

01:19:58.529 --> 01:20:02.283
I have a family now.

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:05.839
I haven't been that ugly little girl
in quite some time.

01:20:06.009 --> 01:20:10.002
You were never ugly.

01:20:11.169 --> 01:20:14.445
Why did you come here?

01:20:49.209 --> 01:20:51.769
David, help!

01:20:51.929 --> 01:20:57.401
I know how kids are.
It didn't mean anything.

01:20:57.569 --> 01:21:04.520
- I didn't mean to come here...
- Winnie, are you all right?

01:21:04.689 --> 01:21:06.884
I'm fine, Ben.

01:21:15.049 --> 01:21:20.885
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.
I didn't want to hurt you again.

01:21:23.289 --> 01:21:25.439
I'm gonna go.

01:21:28.489 --> 01:21:31.162
David?

01:21:33.209 --> 01:21:35.120
Thank you.

01:21:36.089 --> 01:21:39.479
Are you sure?

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:43.802
Thanks.

01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:58.687
David, help!

01:22:50.969 --> 01:22:55.201
Nelson, stop. Stop!

01:22:58.049 --> 01:23:04.727
- Where's Billy Mahoney?
- No one's here but the two of us.

01:23:04.889 --> 01:23:07.198
Let go!

01:23:35.529 --> 01:23:38.168
Where the hell have you guys been?

01:23:41.329 --> 01:23:45.117
- She freaked in class.
- How are you doing?

01:23:45.289 --> 01:23:52.604
Fine, for somebody who keeps seeing
her father who's been dead 20 years.

01:23:53.609 --> 01:23:57.841
"Death is beautiful."
What a bunch of crap.

01:24:01.529 --> 01:24:04.566
How are you doing, Nelson? Okay?

01:24:06.769 --> 01:24:09.841
I'd like to thank you
for the nightmare.

01:24:10.009 --> 01:24:16.084
You were so eager to jump on...
Welcome aboard.

01:24:16.249 --> 01:24:18.479
You withheld information.

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:23.768
- I'm sorry you're so upset.
- You're not the only one at risk!

01:24:23.929 --> 01:24:30.482
- I always felt this was unnatural.
- Steckle, you didn't risk a thing.

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:35.165
- Stop! We're all in this together.
- No, we're not.

01:24:35.329 --> 01:24:38.878
Isn't she strong? So independent.

01:24:39.049 --> 01:24:42.325
When I get into trouble,
I don't drag everybody down with me.

01:24:42.489 --> 01:24:47.768
Come on! What happened to you?
Caught with your videotapes down.

01:24:47.929 --> 01:24:53.879
You swore at a little girl. You're
having bad dreams about your daddy.

01:24:54.049 --> 01:24:59.123
- I'm really sorry!
- You don't know anything about me.

01:24:59.289 --> 01:25:03.168
But Dave does, doesn't he?

01:25:03.329 --> 01:25:08.722
Come on, they're your sins.
Live with them... I do.

01:25:08.889 --> 01:25:13.041
You want to see death?
Take a good look. It <i>is</i> beautiful.

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:18.329
You've already hurt yourself.
Do you want to hurt her, too?

01:25:21.809 --> 01:25:27.884
Help him find Billy Mahoney.
Just do it, all right?

01:25:28.049 --> 01:25:33.681
- Don't leave him alone.
- Why do we want to find Billy?

01:25:33.849 --> 01:25:40.322
Young Dr. Dave thinks
he's solved our karmic problems.

01:25:41.849 --> 01:25:46.127
- Atonement, gentlemen.
- Atonement?

01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:51.522
Wait a goddamn minute!
You're always running away from me.

01:25:51.689 --> 01:25:55.045
Why don't you talk to me?

01:25:58.649 --> 01:26:03.803
- My father shot himself.
- And you feel responsible?

01:26:04.889 --> 01:26:09.917
There was this door in our hallway
and I wasn't supposed to go in...

01:26:10.089 --> 01:26:15.083
Kids always feel responsible.
You could not have been to blame.

01:26:15.249 --> 01:26:20.881
You said it yourself.
People we've wronged want revenge.

01:26:21.049 --> 01:26:25.327
I don't know if this will help,
but going to see Winnie Hicks...

01:26:25.489 --> 01:26:34.761
I can't explain, but it lifted...
just asking for forgiveness...

01:26:34.929 --> 01:26:38.638
Winnie Hicks is alive.
My father's dead.

01:26:38.809 --> 01:26:43.166
Your father is in a good place.

01:26:43.329 --> 01:26:46.958
He wants you to let him go.

01:26:48.089 --> 01:26:51.126
Then why is he back?

01:27:05.049 --> 01:27:06.767
Here.

01:27:06.929 --> 01:27:11.047
- Where the hell are we?
- We'd better get you to a hospital.

01:27:17.569 --> 01:27:23.007
Come on, this is a short cut.
I can't believe I remember all this.

01:27:25.889 --> 01:27:31.759
- The neighbourhood's falling apart.
- Give me the keys!

01:27:31.929 --> 01:27:35.285
<i>Step on a crack</i>
<i>break your mother's back...</i>

01:27:39.569 --> 01:27:45.201
Last one over is a rotten egg!

01:27:46.369 --> 01:27:50.282
Come on, boys,
salvation just ahead.

01:28:04.889 --> 01:28:09.167
This is a graveyard.

01:28:09.329 --> 01:28:15.438
Nelson, where the fuck are you?
This isn't funny any more.

01:28:15.609 --> 01:28:18.123
It never was.

01:28:18.289 --> 01:28:20.883
- Where the hell are you?
- Right here.

01:28:26.049 --> 01:28:30.964
This is where Billy lives. Wake up,
you little shit, you've got company!

01:28:31.929 --> 01:28:37.686
I knew he was here...
because I put him here.

01:28:37.849 --> 01:28:42.877
- Billy Mahoney!
- No, Nelson, don't do it!

01:29:20.849 --> 01:29:25.001
I was taken away from my family
when I was nine years old.

01:29:25.169 --> 01:29:31.119
I went to Stoneham School for Boys.
I thought I'd paid my dues!

01:29:31.289 --> 01:29:36.682
It was an accident.
Let's go home, okay?

01:29:36.849 --> 01:29:43.038
Dave's right...
I can still make amends.

01:29:43.209 --> 01:29:46.519
How?

01:29:55.929 --> 01:30:01.799
- Nelson?
- Joe, I've got to borrow your car.

01:30:04.289 --> 01:30:07.884
Nelson, wait.

01:30:13.449 --> 01:30:15.599
My God!

01:30:48.769 --> 01:30:54.082
Hello.
What? Where?

01:31:07.449 --> 01:31:11.408
Nelson freaked out.
Joe and Steckle are stranded.

01:31:11.569 --> 01:31:14.481
- Will you be all right alone?
- Yeah.

01:33:51.129 --> 01:33:54.087
Daddy.

01:33:57.089 --> 01:34:00.286
Rachel.

01:34:01.129 --> 01:34:04.201
Sweetheart...

01:34:06.569 --> 01:34:09.845
I'm sorry.

01:34:13.969 --> 01:34:18.008
Forgive me.

01:34:51.449 --> 01:34:57.046
Billy Mahoney died 17 years ago,
and Nelson feels responsible.

01:34:57.209 --> 01:35:02.602
- Do you know where he went?
- He ran off to make amends.

01:35:02.769 --> 01:35:06.603
- You think he'd try to flatline?
- Alone? That would be suicide.

01:35:19.449 --> 01:35:23.567
- David?
- No, it's Nelson.

01:35:23.729 --> 01:35:26.562
<i>David's out trying to find you.</i>

01:35:26.729 --> 01:35:33.077
I wanted to say I was sorry.
Please, tell David.

01:35:33.249 --> 01:35:39.643
- <i>I'm sorry I got you into this.</i>
- No, none of that matters now.

01:35:43.929 --> 01:35:48.878
Rachel, everything matters.
Everything we do matters.

01:35:50.049 --> 01:35:53.644
- That's why I'm going under again.
- No, Nelson, wait.

01:35:53.809 --> 01:35:59.042
- <i>Tell me where you are.</i>
- I really am sorry.

01:36:24.889 --> 01:36:28.086
- It's payback for our arrogance.
- Save it.

01:37:00.769 --> 01:37:07.117
It's a good thing I didn't flatline.
I used to tease my fat babysitter.

01:37:14.969 --> 01:37:18.598
Okay, Billy Mahoney, come on.

01:38:56.409 --> 01:39:01.244
- Body temperature down to 78°.
- He used potassium!

01:39:04.889 --> 01:39:09.485
Joe, electrodes!
300. Clear.

01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:16.881
- Nothing.
- We have to go again. Clear.

01:39:26.969 --> 01:39:30.200
Go up to 360. Clear!

01:39:30.369 --> 01:39:36.239
- I can't hear anything.
- He called. It's been nine minutes.

01:39:36.409 --> 01:39:38.559
Let's intubate.

01:39:42.569 --> 01:39:46.528
I can't get it in.
His trachea's too tight.

01:39:51.609 --> 01:39:54.806
Stop, Billy!

01:40:07.049 --> 01:40:11.804
- Nothing.
- Get me 4mg of atropine ready.

01:40:20.089 --> 01:40:23.923
- David...
- Atropine intratracheal.

01:40:24.089 --> 01:40:30.927
- This is a truckload, Dave.
- This has got to work. Come on.

01:40:36.489 --> 01:40:39.561
- Come on, Nelson.
- He's been dead ten minutes.

01:40:39.729 --> 01:40:44.280
- He's not in v-fib.
- Eppy intracardial.

01:40:44.449 --> 01:40:47.441
Just do it!

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:53.047
No!

01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:56.087
Don't do it, Billy!

01:40:56.249 --> 01:40:59.719
I'm sorry!

01:41:25.929 --> 01:41:27.129
Starting CPR!

01:41:27.129 --> 01:41:28.562
Starting CPR!

01:41:29.889 --> 01:41:32.608
It's been 12 minutes! He is dead.

01:41:32.769 --> 01:41:35.442
Breathe!

01:41:38.569 --> 01:41:41.800
Forget about it. We lost him.

01:41:41.969 --> 01:41:44.767
Dave, stop it!

01:41:44.929 --> 01:41:48.638
Stop, David.

01:41:48.809 --> 01:41:52.597
David, stop it!

01:41:52.769 --> 01:41:55.920
Let him go.

01:42:09.849 --> 01:42:14.604
- We're all responsible for this.
- Maybe we deserve this.

01:42:14.769 --> 01:42:18.967
No.
It's not fair and it's not right.

01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:24.647
I'm sorry, God! I'm sorry we stepped
on your fucking territory!

01:42:24.809 --> 01:42:29.007
I'm sorry! Isn't that enough?

01:42:32.729 --> 01:42:38.042
- Apparently not.
- I'll call the police.

01:42:40.569 --> 01:42:46.883
I could hear it in his voice on the
phone. He felt he deserved to die.

01:42:47.089 --> 01:42:53.005
Bullshit! It was a mistake.
He was just a little kid.

01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:56.885
He doesn't deserve to die!

01:44:01.009 --> 01:44:04.399
Come on, Nelson!

01:44:09.329 --> 01:44:13.368
- Clear...
- No, wait!

01:44:16.569 --> 01:44:19.641
I've got a pulse.
We've fucking got him!

01:44:19.809 --> 01:44:24.724
- Come on, pick up the beat.
- Easy, don't rush him.

01:44:24.889 --> 01:44:30.486
- Pick up the beat.
- Don't rush him.

01:44:37.009 --> 01:44:39.887
That's it.

01:44:50.009 --> 01:44:54.685
Hail Mary, praise Jesus,
and all that stuff.

01:44:54.849 --> 01:45:00.765
- Hi, don't try to talk.
- I've got to get this on tape.

01:45:17.169 --> 01:45:19.444
He said...

01:45:21.689 --> 01:45:25.318
He said it wasn't
such a good day to die.

01:45:37.649 --> 01:45:39.609
Thank you.

01:45:39.609 --> 01:45:41.201
Thank you.
