The Cleveland Preserver's
been shut down for 20 years.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.455
You traveled.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.500
How?

27:47.500 --> 27:50.294
We're not really sure, um, but

27:50.294 --> 27:53.297
they had a capsule
and just brought us here.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.091
- Who?
- [Erin] We-we don't know.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.009
They were not much
older than us,

27:57.009 --> 27:58.552
and their faces were scarred.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.389
[KJ] Yeah,

28:01.389 --> 28:04.183
like they had been in
some kind of bad fight

28:04.183 --> 28:05.643
or something.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.065
Where are they now?

28:14.318 --> 28:16.487
They, um...

28:16.487 --> 28:18.781
they were shot.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.991
There was some kind of ambush,

28:20.991 --> 28:23.119
and they were killed.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.081
I'm sorry.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.839
Did you see who did it?

28:34.839 --> 28:37.466
They looked like soldiers.

28:39.635 --> 28:43.264
They had on this armor.
It was white.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.485
[door opens]

28:57.987 --> 28:59.947
[door closes]

29:11.917 --> 29:13.419
[Mac] Wow.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.131
It looks like everything
went right for you after I died.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.971
Sorry.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.057
I didn't mean that like, um,

29:27.057 --> 29:29.351
like a "fuck you" or something.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.980
You're not dead.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.317
You're standing
right in front of me.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.695
[laughs]

29:41.989 --> 29:43.699
How'd you sleep?

29:43.699 --> 29:46.327
Good.

29:46.327 --> 29:48.078
That bed is so nice.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.914
- Bliss, right?
- [Mac] Yeah.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.582
It's my favorite mattress
in the house.

29:53.918 --> 29:56.504
I think I like having
a rich brother.

29:56.504 --> 29:59.215
How about hardworking brother?

29:59.215 --> 30:00.716
Call it what you want,
moneybags,

30:00.716 --> 30:03.302
but I'll tell you
what I need right now.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.845
I need some smokes,

30:04.845 --> 30:08.265
and some donuts,

30:08.265 --> 30:10.059
and then I'm gonna go
to the metal yard,

30:10.059 --> 30:11.352
and we'll break some shit.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.270
I will not be buying you smokes.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.148
There's a really good
donut place up the street,

30:16.148 --> 30:18.776
and I'm sad to report
that the scrap metal yard

30:18.776 --> 30:21.862
is now the Misty Pines
housing development.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.864
That doesn't sound
like progress.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.616
I couldn't agree more.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.662
But before we do anything,
we're gonna go to the hospital

30:29.662 --> 30:31.205
and get some
of your blood drawn.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.874
What? Jesus, do you still
not believe me?

30:33.874 --> 30:35.960
I'm gonna make sure
you never get sick.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.346
Uh, I also have breakfast here,
if it's easier.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.139
How about some muesli?

30:49.139 --> 30:51.392
What the fuck is muesli?

30:51.392 --> 30:53.102
[laughs]

30:53.102 --> 30:55.271
Donuts it is.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.400
Very strange.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.110
[Prioress] What's that?

31:01.110 --> 31:03.195
I'm not seeing release records.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.489
[Prioress] Well, maybe
she hasn't been released yet.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.826
No, that would be indicated.
Uh... [sighs]

31:08.826 --> 31:11.161
It's just a bunch of
nonresponsive answers,

31:11.161 --> 31:12.705
fake birth year,

31:12.705 --> 31:15.499
some nonsense
about being a ghost

31:15.499 --> 31:17.334
traveling through time,

31:17.334 --> 31:19.211
and then nothing.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.714
So, she's not here,
and she's not not here.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.508
- That would seem
to be the case.
- [Prioress] Wow.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.302
21st century bureaucracy

31:26.302 --> 31:29.179
is at an absolute nadir
of efficiency.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.640
Uh, we are a small
department servicing

31:31.640 --> 31:33.851
- a large and extremely...
- Who took that statement?

31:33.851 --> 31:36.812
One of our most experienced
case workers...

31:36.812 --> 31:38.522
Just give me a name.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.065
Excuse me,
but you cannot just march

31:40.065 --> 31:42.610
in here and demand... [grunts]

31:42.610 --> 31:44.320
So, I can rough you up
and get the name that way,

31:44.320 --> 31:45.529
or you can just give it to me.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.656
Either way, I'll make it
so you'll forget

31:47.656 --> 31:48.949
everything that happened.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.576
The roughing up is optional.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.536
[grunts]

31:52.536 --> 31:55.289
What's your pleasure?

31:55.289 --> 31:56.707
- [bones crack]
- Ow. Look.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.303
[Glen winces]

32:09.303 --> 32:10.679
[adult Erin] Okay, come on.
Come on, come on,

32:10.679 --> 32:12.473
come on, come on.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.104
Come on.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.365
Shit!

32:31.158 --> 32:33.243
[KJ] Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.412
[groans]

32:40.918 --> 32:42.336
Hey.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.421
Hey, come back here.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.340
Those were his friends.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.051
[adult Erin panting]

33:02.815 --> 33:04.692
Your friend saved my life.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.863
Mine, too.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.293
[Larry] We're in
the middle of a war.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.295
The men you saw being murdered
were members

33:25.295 --> 33:26.922
of an organization called STF.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.841
Standard Time Fighters.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.969
Its mission is to combat
the Old Watch.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.303
The soldiers in the forest?

33:33.303 --> 33:34.763
- Exactly.
- [Erin] When are they from?

33:34.763 --> 33:37.224
The... Old Guard?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.225
[Larry] Old Watch.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.477
Also the future, but...

33:40.477 --> 33:41.937
earlier than the STF.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.648
Yeah, I know, it's-it's a lot.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.400
Trust me.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.318
Essentially,
the Old Watch is hell-bent

33:48.318 --> 33:50.237
on keeping things
exactly the way they are.

33:50.237 --> 33:51.697
Which, not coincidentally,

33:51.697 --> 33:53.574
keeps them in power, and the STF

33:53.574 --> 33:55.826
is working to course-correct
the moments in history

33:55.826 --> 33:57.327
when mankind lost its way.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.246
So... your friends

33:59.246 --> 34:00.956
are the good guys, right?

34:00.956 --> 34:02.791
Yeah.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.085
That doesn't make sense.
How do they fix things

34:05.085 --> 34:07.713
without disrupting
everything that comes after?

34:07.713 --> 34:09.548
Well, first off, you wouldn't
even know it if they did or not.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.966
- But couldn't it cause...
- [Larry] And secondly,

34:10.966 --> 34:13.552
that's an Old Watch
talking point. It's bullshit.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.014
Things will be disrupted.
They need to be.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.849
The Old Watch are

34:18.849 --> 34:22.770
basically a group of-of
rich reactionaries who...

34:22.770 --> 34:24.480
well, they outlaw time travel

34:24.480 --> 34:26.064
because it threatens
the future that they thrive in.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.233
A future that should've
never been allowed to happen,

34:28.233 --> 34:30.360
of vanishing resources,

34:30.360 --> 34:33.363
- indefensible income
disparities...
- That sounds just like now.

34:33.363 --> 34:35.616
I didn't say the war was over.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.452
Every minute, two steps forward,
one step back,

34:38.452 --> 34:41.789
but, trust me, I've heard what
it's like in the STF's time.

34:41.789 --> 34:42.998
This is worth it.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.583
What is?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.293
The fight.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.587
All this sacrifice.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.214
Are there STF like you
in every time?

34:50.214 --> 34:53.550
Of strategic importance, yes.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.929
- We go by "the Underground."
- [adult Erin] Oh, okay,

34:56.929 --> 34:59.765
- this-this is all
a little over their heads...
- [Tiff] No, it's not.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.558
I'm following.

35:01.558 --> 35:02.851
[KJ] So, the soldiers,

35:02.851 --> 35:04.436
these Old Watch,
they're-they're bad guys?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.855
Well, they feed people
to dinosaurs, so,

35:06.855 --> 35:08.482
what do you think?

35:09.858 --> 35:11.693
Did he just say dinosaurs?

35:11.693 --> 35:14.154
- I think so.
- [Larry] Now things
are changing again,

35:14.154 --> 35:17.115
and I'll be ready.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.493
The Old Watch
is closing in on us.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.578
You girls...

35:21.578 --> 35:23.872
- you girls are targets now.
- What?

35:23.872 --> 35:25.874
- Why?
- They didn't do anything.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.125
Yes, they traveled
out of their time.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.460
That's a capital offense.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.565
Who is that?

35:51.859 --> 35:53.777
Doesn't matter.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.533
Follow me.

36:04.288 --> 36:06.665
Hey, but...

36:06.665 --> 36:08.458
well, there's another one
of us out there.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.752
- What?
- There's another
paper girl from 1988.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.088
- How-how can we
get to her? We...
- Where is she?

36:13.088 --> 36:14.298
We got separated.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.425
[sighs]

36:21.597 --> 36:24.558
Well, I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but...

36:26.518 --> 36:28.437
...your friend is probably dead.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.402
You saw what they did
to Heck and Naldo.

36:42.618 --> 36:44.786
Sorry about the tasing,
by the way. Uh...

36:44.786 --> 36:46.330
That's not who I am,

36:46.330 --> 36:47.789
I swear.

My name's Larry.

36:54.630 --> 36:55.839
[Larry] Can I trust you?

36:55.839 --> 36:57.716
[adult Erin] I don't know,
Larry.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.885
- What do you want us
to say to that?
- You can see the screens?

36:59.885 --> 37:00.928
Yeah.

37:00.928 --> 37:03.430
Then I need
