what yearbook captions you saw,

Oh, hells yeah!

There's only one reason
the lunch lady

00:49.958 --> 00:51.366
puts the gray oven mitt back on:

00:51.385 --> 00:54.444
second tray of French bread
pizza coming out.

00:54.538 --> 00:56.204
Got to move quick
if you want to get the one

00:56.298 --> 00:58.098
with two pepperonis.

00:59.952 --> 01:00.875
-(grunts)
-Hey!

01:00.895 --> 01:02.377
-Move. (grunts)
-(grunts)

01:02.396 --> 01:04.212
STUDENT: I'll have you know
I'm a Stouffer.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.548
Where you at, pepperonis?

01:06.567 --> 01:10.051
Aha! I hope your affairs
are in order.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.236
-Honey?
-The deed to the house

01:11.463 --> 01:13.238
is in the drawer
under the phone.

01:13.390 --> 01:15.365
(snarling)

01:17.136 --> 01:19.060
Meg, what you did back there,

01:19.080 --> 01:21.229
boxing out those students,
was quite impressive.

01:21.398 --> 01:22.306
Really?

01:22.399 --> 01:23.916
Have you ever considered
trying out

01:24.067 --> 01:25.342
for the girls basketball team?

01:25.344 --> 01:27.419
I've just taken the job
as head coach

01:27.646 --> 01:30.163
in an attempt to build character
for my upcoming divorce hearing.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.091
I thought you were
already divorced.

01:32.242 --> 01:35.076
I was.
I'm getting divorced again.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.261
Turns out the first bitch

01:36.413 --> 01:38.597
might've been right
about my misogyny.

01:44.087 --> 01:45.253
Hey, Stewie,
what are you watching?

01:45.347 --> 01:47.514
The most glorious website
of all time:

01:47.608 --> 01:49.108
YouTube.

01:49.335 --> 01:52.352
I only hope the site doesn't run
out of content for me to watch.

01:52.504 --> 01:54.521
You know, you should really
be careful on YouTube, Stewie.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.431
You never know
what's gonna pop up next.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.175
I mean, there's some
wild stuff out there.

01:58.344 --> 02:00.435
-Okay, boomer.
-I'm not a boomer, I'm Gen X.

02:00.529 --> 02:03.622
Brian, you save back issues
of Costco magazine.

02:03.849 --> 02:06.274
Uh, it's called
the<i> Costco Connection,</i>

02:06.368 --> 02:08.201
and it's how I get good deals
on cruises.

02:08.354 --> 02:09.461
Yeah, you're not
helping yourself here.

02:09.688 --> 02:12.372

Jenkins, I'm taking you
off this murder.

03:10.082 --> 03:11.506
You're too close to the case.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.918
Okay, but what if I could get
further away from the case?

03:14.937 --> 03:16.920
-What do you mean?
-What if I could, like,

03:16.939 --> 03:18.605

03:18.757 --> 03:21.700
Oh. Well, then you could stay

Okay, Stewie,
time to rest your little head.

03:34.456 --> 03:35.455
Here's your bottle.

03:35.607 --> 03:38.675
Mommy's gonna nap, too.
Sweet dreams.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.311
(cork pops)

03:51.957 --> 03:53.715
(gasps) She's not sleeping.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.293
She's scrolling through
old photos of herself.

03:56.462 --> 03:58.979
This is exactly what the video
was talking about.

03:59.131 --> 04:02.223
Ugh, look how young I looked.

04:02.317 --> 04:05.244
Oh, my God, now she's retweeting
Hoover sponsored content,

04:05.395 --> 04:06.970
trying to get a free vacuum.

04:06.989 --> 04:09.081
Oh, and now she's scrolled past
a fundraiser

04:09.308 --> 04:11.625
for "Women of Iran,"
not even a "like."

04:18.092 --> 04:19.907
Hey, Quagmire.
What are you doing here?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.485
One of these gals turning 18?

04:21.503 --> 04:23.578
No, Peter. Believe it or not,
I actually care

04:23.597 --> 04:25.839
about Adam West High School
girls basketball.

04:25.991 --> 04:28.675
I'm a longtime fan of the sport,
and I find it relaxing here.

04:28.827 --> 04:29.935
It's never crowded.

04:30.162 --> 04:31.995
Just me and the goth kids
who come here

04:32.014 --> 04:33.497
to actively ignore the game.

04:33.590 --> 04:36.516
So then I said, "What do you
think of my hair now, Dad?"

04:36.668 --> 04:38.944
-What did he say?
-He said he loved me either way.

04:39.095 --> 04:40.094
Ass.

04:40.263 --> 04:42.522
This could be
that championship season.

04:42.599 --> 04:44.616
Finally get that team photo
up at Applebee's.

04:44.768 --> 04:46.809
Oh, God, I don't want
to get ahead of myself.

04:46.811 --> 04:49.270
I don't care about any of that.
Meg is trying out,

04:49.364 --> 04:52.958
and Lois made me come
because she says I'm her "dad."

04:54.795 --> 04:56.019
(whistle blows)

04:56.112 --> 04:58.297
Okay, Griffin, you're up next.
Take a shot.

05:06.865 --> 05:07.806
-(sighs)
-Yeah, no.

05:08.033 --> 05:09.215
I've seen enough, Griffin.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.226
I guess I was wrong about you.

05:13.296 --> 05:15.055
Hey, Meg, I can see your penis.

05:15.207 --> 05:17.316
-(laughs) She looked.
-She did look.

05:17.543 --> 05:18.650
(growls)

05:25.901 --> 05:27.141
(all gasp)

05:27.161 --> 05:29.453
What, are your feet nailed
to the ground? Jump.

05:33.725 --> 05:36.409
Well, okay. You're on the team.

05:36.486 --> 05:37.502
(excited laughter)

05:37.654 --> 05:39.671
All right!
I'm gonna go tell all the guys

05:39.898 --> 05:41.965
at the brewery, like Rudy's dad.

05:43.326 --> 05:46.327
(over P.A.): My daughter
made the basketball team.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.846
(cheering)

05:47.997 --> 05:50.757
I heard a lady fart while she
was pumping gas this morning.

05:50.834 --> 05:54.269
-(louder cheering)
-A lot, a lot
to celebrate today.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.271
Come on,
where's the energy, ladies?

06:05.366 --> 06:07.616
And that was meant
to be an insult.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.202
Ow!

06:10.429 --> 06:13.113
What happened to the Meg
I saw in tryouts?

06:13.265 --> 06:14.447
Our first game is tomorrow,

06:14.600 --> 06:16.600
and the whole team
is counting on you.

06:16.734 --> 06:18.860
-Hey, Meg.
-They just let any strange adult

06:18.879 --> 06:20.286
in here anytime, huh?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.697
Yeah, well, the gym is not
connected to the main campus,

06:22.791 --> 06:25.775
so, uh... But listen, I think
I know what your issue is.

06:25.794 --> 06:27.777
You did much better
at tryouts, right?

06:27.796 --> 06:29.629
-Yeah.
-Well, what was different?

06:29.723 --> 06:32.057
My socks? Wait, no, no.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.208
-Still the same.
-Your dad was here.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.286
Do you think
Dad helps me play better?

06:36.455 --> 06:38.563
"Help" is a more positive word
than I would use,

06:38.790 --> 06:39.806
but, technically, yeah.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.459
Each time he heckled you,
you played well.

06:42.552 --> 06:44.552
I just wanted
to prove him wrong.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.721
Well, there's your spinach,
Popeye.

06:46.815 --> 06:49.557
(laughs) Man, am I aging myself.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.576
All right, I'm gonna go
to the gym snack bar

06:51.728 --> 06:54.746
and buy a Dixie Cup
of Diet Pepsi for six bucks.

06:54.898 --> 06:56.731
It all goes
to the student council.

06:56.825 --> 06:59.626
Well, it-it sure goes
to somebody.

Stewie, it's 3:00.
Shouldn't you be napping?

07:11.432 --> 07:14.507
Done with naps.
My eyes are wide open now, Bri,

07:14.660 --> 07:16.843
-and they're never
closing again.
-What's gotten into you?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.603
I've been fed lies, Brian.

07:18.755 --> 07:21.331
Vaccine-laced breast milk
and lies.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.442
I recently watched
a video on YouTube...

07:23.518 --> 07:25.760
-Oh, here we go.
-...and it proved naps were just

07:25.779 --> 07:28.354
invented by grown-ups
so that they can goof-off.

07:28.431 --> 07:30.115
-What?
-And it doesn't stop there.

that my eyes

07:34.121 --> 07:37.456

07:37.683 --> 07:39.182
Slow down, Stewie.

07:39.201 --> 07:42.035
Yes, there are some white lies
that parents tell their kids,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.520
but that's because
it's for their own good.

07:43.613 --> 07:44.871
Yeah, right.

That's probably what Britney

Dad, can I have some cereal?

07:49.027 --> 07:50.210
There is no cereal.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.788

Meg's pronouns
