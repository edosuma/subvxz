00:13.680 --> 00:15.849
<i>- President Lacey,</i>
<i>I am absolutely horrified</i>

00:15.915 --> 00:17.050
<i>by my behavior last night.</i>

00:17.150 --> 00:18.351
<i>Underage drinking,</i>

00:18.418 --> 00:19.819
<i>destruction of campus property.</i>

00:19.886 --> 00:21.087
<i>I'm better than that,</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:23.323
<i>and I am determined</i>
<i>to make it right.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:26.926
<i>This is a check for $2,000.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:30.430
<i>- It's a starting point.</i>
<i>My mom says we can go up to 10.</i>

00:30.530 --> 00:32.932
<i>- Leighton, you can't</i>
<i>bribe your way out of this.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.834
<i>You threw a tequila bottle</i>
<i>at a statue</i>

00:34.901 --> 00:36.169
<i>and chipped its pinky finger.</i>

00:36.236 --> 00:37.937
<i>Then, you berated</i>
<i>our campus security.</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:39.906
<i>Oh, I did not berate them.</i>

00:40.006 --> 00:42.675
<i>You called them, quote:</i>

00:42.742 --> 00:45.612
<i>"Wannabe cops</i>
<i>with heinous personal style."</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:47.380
<i>That does sound like me.</i>

00:47.447 --> 00:48.948
<i>But in my defense,</i>
<i>I was wasted.</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:50.283
<i>That doesn't help.</i>

00:50.383 --> 00:51.918
<i>You're getting 100 hours</i>
<i>of community service</i>

00:52.018 --> 00:53.753
<i>at the Essex College</i>
<i>Women's Center.</i>

00:53.853 --> 00:55.722
<i>- What is a Women's Center?</i>
<i>Is that like a Curves?</i>

00:55.789 --> 00:59.459
<i>- The Women's Center is...</i>
<i>an inclusive collective</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:01.061
<i>for females</i>
<i>and people of all genders,</i>

01:01.127 --> 01:02.896
<i>where they can organize</i>
<i>feminist activism</i>

01:02.962 --> 01:05.632
<i>and engage in conversations</i>
<i>with like-minded individuals.</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:08.635
<i>- Oh, no. A bunch of woke</i>
<i>nobodies drinking green tea?</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:11.571
<i>Please, I would love</i>
<i>to hear some other options.</i>

01:11.638 --> 01:13.406
<i>There are no other options.</i>

01:13.473 --> 01:15.542
<i>I'll tell the Women's Center</i>
<i>to expect you.</i>

01:15.608 --> 01:17.377
<i>Thanks so much for coming in,</i>
<i>Leighton.</i>

01:17.444 --> 01:19.412
<i>- Well, my family will</i>
<i>no longer be donating</i>

01:19.479 --> 01:20.947
<i>to this institution.</i>

01:21.047 --> 01:22.749
<i>- You know</i>
<i>how many Russian billionaires</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:24.617
<i>send their kids here?</i>

01:24.717 --> 01:26.252
<i>Three.</i>

01:26.319 --> 01:27.887
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

01:27.954 --> 01:29.289
<i>God damn it.</i>

01:42.268 --> 01:43.670
<i>Vermont Tinder is so weird.</i>

01:43.770 --> 01:45.238
<i>Why are all the guys hiking?</i>

01:45.305 --> 01:46.506
<i>This is pointless anyway.</i>

01:46.606 --> 01:48.308
<i>Nobody on here</i>
<i>ever messages back.</i>

01:48.408 --> 01:49.509
<i>All right, hand it over.</i>

01:49.609 --> 01:51.411
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>what you're working with.</i>

01:51.478 --> 01:54.681
<i>Bela, what the actual fuck?</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:56.683
<i>This is why no one's</i>
<i>messaging you back.</i>

01:56.783 --> 01:59.185
<i>You don't even say hi.</i>
<i>You start every conversation</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:01.855
<i>with the words "shirtless pic"</i>
<i>and a question mark.</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:05.792
<i>- Look, I was a nuclear loser</i>
<i>in high school, so excuse me.</i>

02:05.859 --> 02:09.262
<i>For once, I want to date a guy</i>
<i>with sick, ripped, tasty abs</i>

02:09.329 --> 02:12.832
<i>like...</i>
<i>Zac Efron "Baywatch" abs.</i>

02:12.932 --> 02:15.535
<i>- Oh, Efron should not</i>
<i>be your ideal abs.</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:16.769
<i>There are way better.</i>

02:16.836 --> 02:18.671
<i>Gosling</i>
<i>in "Crazy, Stupid, Love."</i>

02:18.771 --> 02:19.873
<i>Oh.</i>

02:19.973 --> 02:21.141
<i>- Michael B.</i>
<i>in "Black Panther."</i>

02:21.207 --> 02:22.609
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- Michael B. in "Creed."</i>

02:22.675 --> 02:24.811
<i>- You know who I bet has abs?</i>

02:24.878 --> 02:27.213
- <i>Beto O'Rourke.</i>
<i>- Oh, I bet he does.</i>

02:27.313 --> 02:29.682
<i>- You actually might be</i>
<i>onto something with that one.</i>

02:33.186 --> 02:35.054
<i>- This has been</i>
<i>the worst morning of my life.</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:38.725
<i>- Oh, my God, did they cancel</i>
<i>your reservation at Mar-a-Lago?</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:42.228
<i>- No, I have to volunteer.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:44.397
<i>Wait, I like volunteering.</i>

02:44.497 --> 02:46.866
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>Also, what is that smell?</i>

02:46.966 --> 02:49.235
<i>- What? Really?</i>

02:49.335 --> 02:51.204
<i>Okay, how do none of you</i>
<i>smell that?</i>

02:51.304 --> 02:53.206
<i>- Well, I thought someone</i>
<i>was trying new perfume,</i>

02:53.306 --> 02:54.240
<i>and I didn't want to be rude.</i>

02:54.340 --> 02:55.742
<i>- I think it's coming from--</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:57.143
<i>- Yep.</i>

02:57.210 --> 02:59.078
<i>Did one of you, like,</i>
<i>shit in the fridge?</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:03.750
<i>- Okay, listen, I think we all</i>
<i>know whose fault this must be.</i>

03:05.385 --> 03:06.386
<i>What, me?</i>

03:06.486 --> 03:08.021
<i>That's racist somehow.</i>

03:08.087 --> 03:10.156
<i>The smell's probably coming</i>
<i>from Leighton's weird,</i>

03:10.223 --> 03:11.591
<i>refrigerated cosmetics.</i>

03:11.691 --> 03:13.193
<i>- I actually stopped</i>
<i>putting them in there</i>

03:13.259 --> 03:14.761
<i>after I found Cheeto dust</i>
<i>in my eye cream.</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:16.162
<i>- Oh, and I guess</i>
<i>you're insinuating</i>

03:16.229 --> 03:17.530
<i>that I was responsible</i>
<i>for that too.</i>

03:17.597 --> 03:18.831
<i>I was.</i>
<i>That one was me.</i>

03:18.898 --> 03:20.233
<i>But I didn't</i>
<i>make the fridge stink.</i>

03:20.333 --> 03:22.001
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>I have to go to practice,</i>

03:22.068 --> 03:24.003
<i>but we will figure out who's</i>
<i>responsible for this later,</i>

03:24.070 --> 03:26.172
<i>and that person</i>
<i>will be the one to clean it.</i>

03:26.239 --> 03:27.340
- <i>Agree?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

03:27.407 --> 03:28.708
<i>- Great.</i>
<i>- Aw, man!</i>

03:28.775 --> 03:31.611
<i>I really think the smell</i>
<i>got into my hair.</i>

03:33.546 --> 03:36.616
<i>- I can't believe you're</i>
<i>getting tutored by Nico today!</i>

03:36.716 --> 03:37.917
<i>What are you gonna wear?</i>

03:38.017 --> 03:39.619
<i>- This.</i>
<i>- Ha! Right.</i>

03:39.719 --> 03:41.087
<i>- No, I'm really</i>
<i>gonna wear this.</i>

03:41.187 --> 03:42.355
<i>A denim jacket?</i>

03:42.422 --> 03:43.756
<i>Are you out</i>
<i>of your fucking mind?</i>

03:43.856 --> 03:45.124
<i>You're getting tutored</i>
<i>by a hot guy.</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:46.693
<i>You're not getting a job</i>
<i>at Applebee's.</i>

03:46.759 --> 03:47.860
<i>Bela, I'm already nervous.</i>

03:47.927 --> 03:49.462
<i>Can you not tell me I look bad?</i>

03:49.562 --> 03:50.797
<i>Okay. It'll be fine.</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:52.098
<i>You got big boobs.</i>

03:52.198 --> 03:54.267
<i>Just, you know,</i>
<i>push them out a lot.</i>

03:55.702 --> 03:56.803
<i>Like this?</i>

03:56.903 --> 03:58.605
<i>- Yeah, girl!</i>
<i>Just like that.</i>

03:58.705 --> 04:00.206
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>I'm gonna try that too.</i>

04:02.742 --> 04:04.377
<i>Great practice, ladies.</i>

04:04.444 --> 04:06.145
<i>And I don't want</i>
<i>to get ahead of things,</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:08.147
<i>but we could have a shot</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:10.617
<i>at finally making</i>
<i>the tournament this year,</i>

04:10.717 --> 04:14.153
<i>thanks to our</i>
<i>new first-year talent.</i>

04:14.254 --> 04:16.556
<i>All right,</i>
<i>now in terms of strategy,</i>

04:16.623 --> 04:18.992
<i>You mids, don't kick</i>
<i>the ball forward.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:21.661
<i>We're going for possession,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

04:23.963 --> 04:25.598
<i>- Oh, you look</i>
<i>so fucking hot today.</i>

04:25.665 --> 04:27.300
<i>You too.</i>

04:31.604 --> 04:33.840
<i>- I have to answer this.</i>

04:33.940 --> 04:35.808
<i>It's Michelle, and two calls</i>
<i>means an emergency.</i>

04:35.908 --> 04:37.677
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Oh, God. It's a FaceTime.</i>

04:37.777 --> 04:40.680
<i>It's connecting.</i>
<i>Hide! Hide!</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:42.348
<i>Hey!</i>

04:42.448 --> 04:45.251
<i>- Hey, babe. I'm outside.</i>
<i>- Sorry. You're what?</i>

04:47.587 --> 04:49.122
<i>What? What was that?</i>

04:49.188 --> 04:50.990
<i>- I'm, uh--I'm counting</i>
<i>the aluminum bats</i>

04:51.090 --> 04:52.925
<i>like I always do.</i>
<i>Did you say you're here?</i>

04:52.992 --> 04:55.161
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, we have</i>
<i>to go get the credenza</i>

04:55.261 --> 04:56.763
<i>that I bought in Cos Cob.</i>
<i>You remember?</i>

04:56.829 --> 04:58.364
<i>- I didn't realize</i>
<i>we bought that.</i>

04:58.464 --> 05:00.433
<i>I thought we were sticking</i>
<i>with our current hutch.</i>

05:00.500 --> 05:01.601
<i>No, we're getting a new one.</i>

05:01.668 --> 05:03.336
<i>Hey, is your shirt off?</i>

05:03.436 --> 05:06.005
<i>- Oh, yeah. I spilled</i>
<i>a bunch of soup on it.</i>

05:06.105 --> 05:07.707
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>
<i>I'll see you out there.</i>

05:07.807 --> 05:09.442
<i>Cool.</i>

05:09.509 --> 05:11.144
<i>- Look, I don't know</i>
<i>what a credenza is,</i>

05:11.210 --> 05:12.712
<i>but it doesn't sound like</i>
<i>something you buy</i>

05:12.812 --> 05:14.213
<i>if you're about</i>
<i>to end your marriage.</i>

05:14.314 --> 05:15.848
<i>- Look, Michelle and I</i>
<i>have been together</i>

05:15.948 --> 05:17.283
<i>for six years.</i>
<i>I need to find</i>

05:17.350 --> 05:18.885
<i>the right moment</i>
<i>and do this in a kind way.</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:21.454
<i>- Fine, but just so you know,</i>
<i>I don't love this.</i>

05:21.521 --> 05:24.524
<i>The only time I condone</i>
<i>cheating is on "Love Island."</i>

05:24.624 --> 05:26.225
<i>I love you.</i>

05:26.326 --> 05:28.061
<i>What?</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:30.229
<i>- Oh...</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:32.632
<i>Just go buy your hutch thing.</i>

05:46.679 --> 05:48.715
<i>- Vrai.</i>
<i>- "Fray."</i>

05:48.815 --> 05:50.316
<i>No, look at my mouth.</i>

05:50.383 --> 05:51.918
<i>Watch what I'm doing</i>
<i>with my lips.</i>

05:53.686 --> 05:54.887
<i>Vrai.</i>

05:58.858 --> 06:00.426
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Sorry.</i>

06:00.526 --> 06:02.428
<i>Um,</i> <i> vrai.</i>

06:02.528 --> 06:03.730
<i>- That's it.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

06:03.830 --> 06:05.264
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>you're improving already.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:07.834
<i>How did you get so fluent?</i>

06:07.900 --> 06:10.236
<i>- When I was little, we had</i>
<i>this au pair named Camille</i>

06:10.336 --> 06:11.771
<i>from Marseille.</i>

06:11.871 --> 06:15.341
<i>She practically raised me</i>
<i>'cause my mom was always, uh,</i>

06:15.408 --> 06:17.210
<i>actually, who knows</i>
<i>what she was doing.</i>

06:17.276 --> 06:19.045
<i>Oh, I totally get that.</i>

06:19.112 --> 06:20.413
<i>Both my parents worked a lot,</i>

06:20.513 --> 06:22.181
<i>so I spent all my time</i>
<i>with my nana.</i>

06:22.248 --> 06:26.119
<i>One time, she had a stroke</i>
<i>while we were doing a puzzle.</i>

06:26.219 --> 06:28.788
<i>But your story's a lot cuter,</i>
<i>so tell me more about Camille.</i>

06:30.022 --> 06:32.458
<i>- Uh, Camille was</i>
<i>the fucking best.</i>

06:32.558 --> 06:34.460
<i>She'd make me chicken nuggets,</i>
<i>and we'd sit together</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:37.430
<i>and watch her favorite French</i>
<i>TV show, "Les Craquantes."</i>

06:37.530 --> 06:39.298
<i>That sounds very fancy.</i>

06:39.399 --> 06:41.267
<i>- It was a dubbed version</i>
<i>of "The Golden Girls."</i>

06:41.367 --> 06:42.802
<i>Oh.</i>

06:42.902 --> 06:45.271
<i>- The first word I learned</i>
<i>in French was "ménopause."</i>

06:45.371 --> 06:46.706
<i>Ménopause.</i>

06:46.773 --> 06:48.941
<i>- Oui, ménopause.</i>

06:55.782 --> 06:57.784
<i>- I just wanna thank you again</i>
<i>for doing this.</i>

06:57.884 --> 06:58.818
<i>It's really nice.</i>

06:58.918 --> 07:00.153
<i>Yeah, don't mention it.</i>

07:00.253 --> 07:02.155
- <i>Oh, but before I forget.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:05.625
<i>Can you sign this?</i>

07:05.725 --> 07:07.827
<i>If I do enough tutoring hours,</i>
<i>I get an extra half-credit</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:09.128
<i>towards my minor.</i>

07:09.228 --> 07:11.664
<i>- Oh, you get credit</i>
<i>for tutoring.</i>

07:11.764 --> 07:13.332
<i>Is that okay?</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:15.101
<i>- Totally okay.</i>
<i>Of course, of course.</i>

07:15.168 --> 07:17.970
<i>This was simply transactional.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

07:22.308 --> 07:25.611
<i>Mmm, young Stalin can get it!</i>

07:25.678 --> 07:26.813
<i>Right?</i>

07:26.913 --> 07:28.514
<i>Dude could've been</i>
<i>on "Riverdale."</i>

07:43.629 --> 07:44.964
<i>Hi, I'm Bela.</i>

07:45.031 --> 07:46.766
<i>Like in "Twilight,"</i>
<i>but Indian.</i>

07:49.769 --> 07:50.636
<i>Cool.</i>

07:53.306 --> 07:55.374
<i>- I love that Susan B. Anthony</i>
<i>is being honored</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:56.776
<i>in the Essex Portrait Gallery.</i>

07:56.843 --> 07:58.544
<i>I'm just saying,</i>
<i>the artist clearly enhanced</i>

07:58.644 --> 08:00.046
<i>the size of her breasts.</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:01.948
<i>- Maybe it's symbolic</i>
<i>of her female power.</i>

08:02.014 --> 08:04.350
<i>- Or maybe</i>
<i>she actually had a huge rack.</i>

08:04.450 --> 08:05.384
<i>How would we know?</i>

08:07.220 --> 08:09.021
<i>Hey. I'm Leighton.</i>

08:09.121 --> 08:10.556
<i>I got caught underage drinking.</i>

08:10.656 --> 08:12.725
<i>That's why I have to work here.</i>

08:12.825 --> 08:14.627
<i>- I'm Ginger.</i>
<i>She, her, hers.</i>

08:14.694 --> 08:16.229
<i>- Lindsay.</i>
<i>She, her, hers.</i>

08:16.329 --> 08:17.563
<i>- Alicia.</i>
<i>She, her, hers.</i>

08:17.663 --> 08:19.398
<i>- Tova.</i>
<i>They, them, theirs.</i>

08:19.499 --> 08:20.867
<i>Hmm.</i>

08:22.201 --> 08:23.569
<i>Oh, right. Sure.</i>

08:23.669 --> 08:25.571
<i>Well, I'm she.</i>
<i>Obviously.</i>

08:25.671 --> 08:27.073
<i>Cool.</i>

08:27.173 --> 08:28.574
<i>I oversee all the volunteers.</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:30.676
<i>- Oh, great.</i>
<i>Should we talk scheduling?</i>

08:30.743 --> 08:32.411
<i>Um, I was thinking that</i>
<i>I would work mornings</i>

08:32.511 --> 08:34.146
<i>from 9:30 to 10:15-ish,</i>

08:34.213 --> 08:36.015
<i>and then, you know,</i>
<i>round that up to an hour,</i>

08:36.082 --> 08:37.316
<i>for timesheet purposes.</i>

08:37.383 --> 08:38.751
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>that's not how this works.</i>

08:38.851 --> 08:40.152
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>when we need help,</i>

08:40.219 --> 08:41.587
<i>and that's when you'll be here.</i>

08:41.687 --> 08:43.389
<i>Like tomorrow</i>
<i>from 5:00 to 10:00,</i>

08:43.489 --> 08:45.424
<i>you'll be helping with</i>
<i>our feminist poetry group.</i>

08:45.525 --> 08:47.660
<i>- As tempting as that sounds,</i>
<i>I'm kind of busy on Fridays.</i>

08:47.727 --> 08:49.195
<i>Shit, I didn't realize that.</i>

08:49.262 --> 08:51.063
<i>Maybe we should just</i>
<i>shut down the whole place</i>

08:51.163 --> 08:52.431
<i>till you're free.</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:53.866
<i>Okay, I am from New York,</i>

08:53.933 --> 08:55.535
<i>so I can tell</i>
<i>that you're being sarcastic.</i>

08:55.601 --> 08:58.404
<i>- Hey, this is, uh,</i>
<i>getting a little tense.</i>

08:58.504 --> 09:00.239
<i>I'm gonna hit</i>
<i>the Safe Space Bell.</i>

09:00.339 --> 09:02.341
<i>- What?</i>

09:02.408 --> 09:03.876
<i>It's a bell that we hit</i>

09:03.943 --> 09:05.778
<i>when we think it'd be good</i>
<i>to have a safe space.</i>

09:05.878 --> 09:08.781
<i>- Uh, isn't this already</i>
<i>a safe space?</i>

09:08.881 --> 09:10.116
<i>Okay.</i>

09:10.216 --> 09:11.617
<i>I'm just saying</i>
<i>that maybe we've gotten</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:13.185
<i>a little bit too sensitive</i>
<i>as a society</i>

09:13.252 --> 09:15.021
<i>if even a safe space isn't--</i>

09:15.087 --> 09:17.924
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>- It's all good, Ginger.</i>

09:18.024 --> 09:21.193
<i>What we do here, whether</i>
<i>it seems stupid to you or not,</i>

09:21.260 --> 09:22.929
<i>really does help people.</i>

09:23.029 --> 09:25.932
<i>So we're not looking for your</i>
<i>feedback at the moment, okay?</i>

09:26.032 --> 09:29.302
<i>Oh, and don't say</i>
<i>your pronouns are obvious.</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:30.803
<i>That makes you suck.</i>

09:30.903 --> 09:32.805
<i>Suggesting that you don't have</i>
<i>to use your pronouns</i>

09:32.905 --> 09:34.440
<i>when other people do</i>
<i>makes you sound like</i>

09:34.540 --> 09:35.808
<i>a really dumb, cis bitch.</i>

09:35.908 --> 09:37.944
<i>I heard it, Ginger!</i>

09:38.044 --> 09:40.146
<i>Welcome to the Women's Center,</i>
<i>Leighton.</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:41.881
<i>See you at poetry night.</i>

09:44.717 --> 09:47.219
<i>- Hi. My mom says</i>
<i>we can go up to 20,000.</i>

09:47.286 --> 09:49.922
<i>- You're doing the</i>
<i>community service, Leighton.</i>

09:49.989 --> 09:51.824
<i>Grow from pain.</i>

09:54.994 --> 09:57.296
<i>- Girls, I have</i>
<i>a delicate matter.</i>

09:57.396 --> 09:59.231
<i>There have been some complaints</i>

09:59.298 --> 10:02.301
<i>about a...stench</i>
<i>coming from your room.</i>

10:02.401 --> 10:04.670
<i>But there's no need</i>
<i>to be embarrassed.</i>

10:04.770 --> 10:07.139
<i>This happens to one suite</i>
<i>every year.</i>

10:07.239 --> 10:08.641
<i>What does?</i>

10:08.741 --> 10:10.610
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>We're the smelly suite.</i>

10:10.676 --> 10:12.511
<i>- No, that "we"</i>
<i>better not include me.</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:14.146
<i>Okay, who complained?</i>

10:14.246 --> 10:16.649
<i>- Sorry, Leighton.</i>
<i>All complaints are anonymous.</i>

10:16.749 --> 10:17.950
<i>I cannot name names.</i>

10:18.017 --> 10:19.318
<i>- I can!</i>
<i>It was me.</i>

10:19.418 --> 10:22.188
<i>It smells like</i>
<i>a tooth abscess in here.</i>

10:22.288 --> 10:24.190
<i>It's so bad</i>
<i>that nobody showed up</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:25.858
<i>to my murder-mystery party</i>
<i>last night.</i>

10:25.958 --> 10:27.693
<i>- Yeah, Travis.</i>
<i>I'm sure that's related.</i>

10:27.793 --> 10:30.129
<i>- Well, thank you, Frude, for</i>
<i>bringing this to our attention.</i>

10:30.196 --> 10:31.631
<i>We're gonna chat about it</i>
<i>as a group,</i>

10:31.697 --> 10:33.199
- <i>and we'll get it all fixed.</i>
<i>- Okey-dokey.</i>

10:33.299 --> 10:34.533
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- That's a good enough</i>

10:34.634 --> 10:36.702
- <i>resolution for you?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:36.802 --> 10:38.871
<i>We're throwing that</i>
<i>fucking fridge out, now.</i>

10:38.971 --> 10:40.806
<i>- No, that was</i>
<i>my high school graduation gift.</i>

10:40.873 --> 10:42.775
<i>- That is the saddest sentence</i>
<i>I have ever heard.</i>

10:42.842 --> 10:44.010
<i>Look, I don't care.</i>

10:44.110 --> 10:45.311
<i>I will not have a reputation</i>

10:45.378 --> 10:46.812
<i>as a smelly suite girl.</i>

10:46.879 --> 10:48.547
- <i>The fridge has to go.</i>
<i>- We can just clean it.</i>

10:48.648 --> 10:50.449
<i>And since we don't know</i>
<i>who created the smell--</i>

10:50.516 --> 10:51.784
<i>- It was Bela.</i>
<i>- Bela.</i>

10:51.851 --> 10:54.654
<i>- Offensive!</i>
<i>Offensive conjecture.</i>

10:54.720 --> 10:57.056
<i>- Why don't we all</i>
<i>clean it out together tonight?</i>

10:57.156 --> 10:59.525
<i>It could be like a fun</i>
<i>group bonding experience.</i>

10:59.625 --> 11:01.227
<i>I genuinely wish I could.</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:04.030
- <i>I have a women's center thing.</i>
<i>- Yeah, I can't either.</i>

11:04.130 --> 11:05.898
<i>I'm gonna get piped</i>
<i>by a guy with abs tonight.</i>

11:05.998 --> 11:07.299
<i>- "Piped"?</i>
<i>- Yeah, piped.</i>

11:07.366 --> 11:09.301
<i>Railed. Torn up.</i>
<i>Slit-slammed.</i>

11:09.368 --> 11:11.404
<i>- "Slit-slammed"?</i>
<i>Bela, Jesus Christ!</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:14.540
<i>- What?</i>
<i>It's how people talk.</i>

11:14.640 --> 11:15.741
<i>- What? Nope.</i>
<i>- It's me.</i>

11:15.841 --> 11:17.743
<i>- You wish.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

11:19.645 --> 11:22.915
<i>- Yes!</i>
<i>Ha, I beat you again.</i>

11:23.015 --> 11:24.417
<i>I let you win.</i>

11:24.517 --> 11:26.919
- <i>By being out of shape.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:27.019 --> 11:29.755
<i>So how was, um,</i>
<i>picking up the credenza?</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:33.592
<i>- Oh, man, Whit, I cannot wait</i>
<i>to show you how ugly it is.</i>

11:33.693 --> 11:35.094
- <i>I took a picture.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:35.194 --> 11:36.929
<i>- It is so bad.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>

11:37.029 --> 11:38.397
<i>Do you have me saved</i>
<i>in your phone</i>

11:38.497 --> 11:40.099
<i>as "Steven Kim Accountant"?</i>

11:40.199 --> 11:42.501
<i>- Yeah, this way,</i>
<i>if Michelle sees a text pop up,</i>

11:42.568 --> 11:44.070
<i>she won't suspect anything.</i>

11:44.170 --> 11:47.039
<i>And who's "Honey Bunny"?</i>

11:47.106 --> 11:48.941
<i>That's Michelle.</i>

11:49.041 --> 11:51.010
<i>- Dude, are you</i>
<i>fucking kidding me?</i>

11:51.077 --> 11:54.113
<i>She's "Honey Bunny,"</i>
<i>and I'm an imaginary Asian CPA?</i>

11:54.213 --> 11:55.414
<i>That's perfect.</i>

11:55.514 --> 11:57.349
<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>how much longer</i>

11:57.416 --> 11:59.385
<i>I can keep</i>
<i>sneaking around like this.</i>

11:59.452 --> 12:01.387
<i>Does none of this bother you?</i>

12:01.454 --> 12:02.888
<i>Of course, it does.</i>

12:02.955 --> 12:04.623
<i>I have this unbelievably cool</i>

12:04.724 --> 12:06.125
<i>and beautiful person</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

12:06.225 --> 12:07.860
<i>and I can't tell anyone</i>
<i>about it?</i>

12:07.927 --> 12:10.396
<i>It's terrible.</i>
<i>It sucks.</i>

12:10.463 --> 12:12.298
<i>- I just want us</i>
<i>to go on a date.</i>

12:12.398 --> 12:14.133
<i>Like an actual date,</i>

12:14.233 --> 12:15.768
<i>not like</i>
<i>a "let's make out in my car</i>

12:15.868 --> 12:17.436
<i>behind this Best Buy" date.</i>

12:17.536 --> 12:18.871
<i>Some of my fondest memories</i>

12:18.938 --> 12:20.372
<i>are in that</i>
<i>Best Buy parking lot with you.</i>

12:20.439 --> 12:22.141
<i>There's some beautiful stuff</i>
<i>happening there.</i>

12:22.241 --> 12:24.643
<i>- I'm not in the mood to joke</i>
<i>around about this right now.</i>

12:27.113 --> 12:29.415
<i>All right.</i>

12:29.482 --> 12:31.150
<i>Race you back to campus?</i>

12:31.250 --> 12:34.253
<i>- No, uh, I'm gonna go</i>
<i>take a solo run.</i>

12:41.761 --> 12:43.329
<i>- So is there something</i>
<i>going on between you</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.765
- <i>and the hot French tutor?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

12:45.831 --> 12:48.067
<i>Why? Did he ask about me</i>
<i>or something</i>

12:48.134 --> 12:49.735
<i>when he ordered his coffee</i>
<i>yesterday?</i>

12:49.802 --> 12:51.670
<i>- Yeah. He--</i>

12:51.771 --> 12:54.173
<i>He asked me</i>
<i>if you were seeing anyone.</i>

12:54.273 --> 12:55.474
<i>Stop.</i>

12:55.574 --> 12:56.509
<i>Nah, he didn't.</i>

12:56.609 --> 12:58.110
<i>He couldn't care less.</i>

12:58.177 --> 13:00.412
<i>But maybe he will, 'cause</i>
<i>he's walking in right now.</i>

13:00.479 --> 13:01.847
<i>- Oh, ha ha!</i>
<i>That's so funny.</i>

13:01.947 --> 13:03.783
<i>Yeah, I'm sure</i>
<i>he's walking in right now.</i>

13:03.849 --> 13:06.018
- <i>Hey!</i>
<i>- How's it going?</i>

13:06.118 --> 13:07.920
<i>- Uh, I'm just working.</i>
<i>Nothing much.</i>

13:07.987 --> 13:10.456
<i>Definitely not talking</i>
<i>about anything specific.</i>

13:11.991 --> 13:15.294
<i>- You have a face</i>
<i>to write songs about.</i>

13:15.361 --> 13:17.530
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:17.630 --> 13:20.266
<i>- So, what brings you in?</i>
<i>Did you want a drink?</i>

13:20.332 --> 13:22.802
<i>Or a café au lait?</i>

13:22.868 --> 13:24.937
<i>Hey, good pronunciation.</i>

13:25.004 --> 13:26.505
<i>But no, I just stopped in</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

13:26.605 --> 13:28.307
<i>I was thinking,</i>
<i>for our next tutoring session,</i>

13:28.374 --> 13:29.875
<i>we could watch "Golden Girls"</i>
<i>in French,</i>

13:29.975 --> 13:31.443
<i>the way I learned</i>
<i>with my au pair.</i>

13:31.510 --> 13:32.778
<i>Maybe tonight?</i>

13:32.845 --> 13:34.446
<i>Yeah. Yes. Yeah.</i>

13:34.513 --> 13:37.316
<i>I think that sounds both</i>
<i>educational and entertaining.</i>

13:37.383 --> 13:39.318
<i>You're such a good tutor.</i>

13:39.385 --> 13:42.121
<i>- Great. I'll see you tonight.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

13:43.989 --> 13:45.891
<i>- You're staring at his butt.</i>
<i>- Lila! God!</i>

13:45.991 --> 13:47.493
<i>- The idea of sitting</i>
<i>through a musical</i>

13:47.560 --> 13:49.395
<i>makes me want</i>
<i>to light myself on fire.</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:52.064
<i>Which I did once to get out of</i>
<i>an Indian thing with my family.</i>

13:54.133 --> 13:55.634
<i>Hey, do you want anything</i>
<i>from inside?</i>

13:55.701 --> 13:57.303
<i>- Nah, I'm good.</i>
<i>- You sure?</i>

13:57.369 --> 13:59.805
<i>- Actually, could you get me</i>
<i>a mug of dry Cap'n Crunch?</i>

14:03.709 --> 14:05.344
<i>Dude, are you</i>
<i>fucking seeing this?</i>

14:05.411 --> 14:06.912
<i>I'm slaying this date so hard!</i>

14:07.012 --> 14:09.148
<i>- Girl, he's laughing</i>
<i>at everything you're saying.</i>

14:09.215 --> 14:10.916
<i>And you're not even</i>
<i>being funny.</i>

14:11.016 --> 14:12.852
<i>- I'm finally gonna hook up</i>
<i>with a guy with abs.</i>

14:12.918 --> 14:16.088
<i>- Wait, you never hooked up</i>
<i>with a guy with abs before?</i>

14:16.188 --> 14:17.256
<i>Have you?</i>

14:17.356 --> 14:19.992
<i>Honey, I pull.</i>

14:20.059 --> 14:21.327
<i>Hey.</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:25.698
<i>Dude.</i>

14:25.764 --> 14:28.200
<i>Here you go.</i>

14:28.267 --> 14:30.102
<i>Two chicken breasts.</i>

14:30.202 --> 14:33.172
- <i>Must be cheat day.</i>

14:35.741 --> 14:37.610
<i>"Happy Father's Day.</i>

14:37.710 --> 14:39.078
<i>"Dad,</i>

14:39.178 --> 14:43.349
<i>"thanks for always</i>
<i>protecting me from spiders,</i>

14:43.415 --> 14:45.217
<i>"from nightmares,</i>

14:45.284 --> 14:50.055
<i>from feeling respected</i>
<i>as a woman."</i>

14:52.625 --> 14:54.760
<i>"My nipples are my own.</i>

14:54.860 --> 14:57.363
<i>But will they</i>
<i>ever truly be free?"</i>

14:57.429 --> 15:01.200
<i>- "Oh, beautiful,</i>
<i>disgracious skies.</i>

15:01.267 --> 15:04.803
- <i>For amber waves of pain!"</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

15:04.904 --> 15:07.606
<i>- Leighton, stop filming</i>
<i>people without their consent.</i>

15:07.706 --> 15:10.042
<i>Yes, Warden.</i>

15:10.109 --> 15:11.577
<i>- Are you seriously</i>
<i>getting drunk</i>

15:11.644 --> 15:12.978
<i>at an event</i>
<i>that you're working</i>

15:13.078 --> 15:14.647
<i>because you were caught</i>
<i>getting drunk?</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:16.482
<i>Yep.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:17.950
<i>- Ridiculous.</i>

15:18.050 --> 15:19.985
<i>- I figure,</i>
<i>if it's okay with you,</i>

15:20.085 --> 15:22.154
<i>I'll sing a few songs tonight.</i>

15:22.254 --> 15:23.956
<i>This first one is about a woman</i>

15:24.056 --> 15:27.293
<i>who deserves more love</i>
<i>than she gets.</i>

15:27.393 --> 15:28.494
<i>Mother Nature.</i>

15:39.905 --> 15:41.140
<i>- Leighton,</i>
<i>what the actual fuck?</i>

15:44.977 --> 15:47.246
<i>That's it.</i>

15:47.313 --> 15:50.015
<i>I'm not signing off</i>
<i>on any of your hours tonight.</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:52.351
<i>- What?</i>
<i>Wait, you can't do that.</i>

15:52.451 --> 15:55.487
<i>I deserve double hours</i>
<i>for sitting through this shit.</i>

15:55.587 --> 15:58.657
<i>- Why?</i>
<i>All you did was drink wine.</i>

15:58.757 --> 16:00.326
<i>And eat very noisy snacks!</i>

16:00.426 --> 16:03.262
<i>- But I was here.</i>
<i>- I don't care.</i>

16:03.329 --> 16:06.365
<i>You know, you just wasted</i>
<i>three hours of your own life.</i>

16:06.465 --> 16:09.501
<i>Zero down.</i>
<i>100 to go.</i>

16:20.379 --> 16:21.814
<i>May I?</i>

16:21.880 --> 16:24.683
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

16:24.783 --> 16:26.051
<i>Wow!</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:28.120
<i>They are just incredible.</i>

16:30.689 --> 16:33.192
<i>- Do you want to have sex, or--</i>
<i>- Uh, in a--in a second.</i>

16:33.292 --> 16:34.526
<i>I just want to look at you</i>
<i>for a bit.</i>

16:34.626 --> 16:37.463
- <i>Really burn the image in.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

16:37.529 --> 16:39.631
<i>- Okay, I'm ready.</i>
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>

16:44.403 --> 16:45.571
<i>You're so fucking hot.</i>

16:45.671 --> 16:48.007
<i>You're so fucking funny.</i>

16:50.042 --> 16:51.176
<i>You're so fucking hot.</i>

16:51.243 --> 16:52.845
<i>You're so fucking funny.</i>

16:54.213 --> 16:55.581
<i>You're so fucking hot.</i>

16:55.681 --> 16:57.716
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>you're so fucking funny.</i>

16:57.816 --> 16:59.385
<i>He's a chucklefucker.</i>

16:59.485 --> 17:00.419
<i>- A what?</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:02.254
<i>A chucklefucker.</i>

17:02.354 --> 17:03.889
<i>He only likes me</i>
<i>'cause I'm funny.</i>

17:03.989 --> 17:06.592
<i>- I don't think that's a word.</i>
<i>- Or, like, a thing.</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:07.926
<i>- He must</i>
<i>find you attractive too.</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:09.228
<i>No one sleeps with someone</i>

17:09.328 --> 17:10.763
<i>just because</i>
<i>they think they're funny.</i>

17:10.863 --> 17:12.097
<i>Oh, really, Whitney?</i>

17:12.197 --> 17:13.866
<i>Then explain why</i>
<i>I masturbate to Kyle Mooney.</i>

17:13.932 --> 17:15.734
<i>- Bela, stop telling me</i>
<i>what you masturbate to.</i>

17:15.834 --> 17:18.037
<i>- Wait, I thought you wanted</i>
<i>people to think you were funny.</i>

17:18.103 --> 17:19.838
<i>- No, not when</i>
<i>I also want him to think</i>

17:19.905 --> 17:22.007
<i>I'm a RiRi-level hot bitch.</i>

17:22.074 --> 17:24.676
<i>I told him he reminded me</i>
<i>of David Beckham,</i>

17:24.743 --> 17:27.346
<i>and he told me</i>
<i>I reminded him of Larry David.</i>

17:27.413 --> 17:30.182
<i>- I'm confused. Larry David's</i>
<i>a lot funnier than you.</i>

17:30.249 --> 17:32.684
<i>- Speaking of David Beckham,</i>
<i>we won our game.</i>

17:32.751 --> 17:34.853
<i>I scored two goals and had</i>
<i>an assist, no big deal.</i>

17:34.920 --> 17:36.288
<i>Whitney was so good!</i>

17:36.388 --> 17:38.223
<i>And I tried to start a wave</i>
<i>in the stands,</i>

17:38.290 --> 17:39.792
<i>but there weren't</i>
<i>enough people.</i>

17:39.892 --> 17:42.127
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- So what am I supposed to do?</i>

17:42.227 --> 17:44.430
<i>- Damn, we got back</i>
<i>to your thing real quick.</i>

17:44.530 --> 17:46.465
<i>- Honestly, Bela, I don't</i>
<i>think this is such a bad thing.</i>

17:46.565 --> 17:49.435
<i>You like him for his abs, he</i>
<i>likes you because you're funny.</i>

17:49.535 --> 17:51.303
<i>You both have</i>
<i>your really specific reasons.</i>

17:51.403 --> 17:53.605
<i>- Yeah, but I'm a romantic,</i>
<i>so I want us to like each other</i>

17:53.705 --> 17:55.908
<i>for the same, specific reason:</i>
<i>that we're both insatiably</i>

17:55.974 --> 17:57.543
<i>into each other's hot faces</i>
<i>and bods.</i>

17:57.609 --> 17:59.278
<i>- I feel like</i>
<i>there's a clear lesson</i>

17:59.378 --> 18:01.480
<i>you should be learning here,</i>
<i>and you're not grasping it.</i>

18:01.580 --> 18:03.916
<i>- Yeah, you're right.</i>
<i>The lesson is clear.</i>

18:03.982 --> 18:05.150
<i>I've got</i>
<i>to break it off with him.</i>

18:05.250 --> 18:06.485
<i>I've got to find</i>
<i>an even hotter guy</i>

18:06.585 --> 18:08.153
<i>and not be myself around him.</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:09.788
<i>- Nope.</i>
<i>That was not the lesson.</i>

18:09.888 --> 18:10.889
<i>Thanks for the talk, guys.</i>

18:15.561 --> 18:18.564
<i>- I really like Bela, but if I</i>
<i>had to share a room with her,</i>

18:18.630 --> 18:19.731
<i>I'd drown myself.</i>

18:21.100 --> 18:22.434
<i>Where are you</i>
<i>taking the cheesecake?</i>

18:22.501 --> 18:23.836
<i>Oh, it's a long story.</i>

18:23.936 --> 18:26.805
<i>It's an inside joke</i>
<i>between Nico and me.</i>

18:26.905 --> 18:28.173
<i>- Does Leighton know</i>
<i>how much time</i>

18:28.273 --> 18:30.175
<i>you've been spending</i>
<i>with her brother?</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:32.344
<i>- No, but there's</i>
<i>really nothing to tell.</i>

18:32.444 --> 18:34.012
<i>He's just tutoring me.</i>

18:34.113 --> 18:35.981
<i>Although maybe don't</i>
<i>say anything to Leighton.</i>

18:36.081 --> 18:37.449
<i>- Sure.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

18:37.516 --> 18:39.184
<i>- I'll see you later.</i>
<i>- Have fun with the team.</i>

18:39.284 --> 18:40.752
<i>- Thanks.</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:49.361
- <i>Hey.</i>
<i>- Where are you right now?</i>

18:49.461 --> 18:52.197
<i>- On my way to meet up with</i>
<i>the team to celebrate our win.</i>

18:52.297 --> 18:54.700
<i>- Okay, first off,</i>
<i>you played like a star,</i>

18:54.800 --> 18:56.268
<i>and getting wasted</i>
<i>with your friends</i>

18:56.335 --> 18:57.836
<i>is totally appropriate.</i>

18:57.936 --> 19:01.039
<i>And also, I think</i>
<i>you should blow the team off.</i>

19:01.140 --> 19:02.774
<i>And why should I do that?</i>

19:02.841 --> 19:04.977
<i>- I've been thinking about</i>
<i>what you said the other night,</i>

19:05.043 --> 19:06.445
<i>about how we haven't had</i>
<i>a real date.</i>

19:06.512 --> 19:07.846
<i>And I think you're right,</i>

19:07.946 --> 19:10.149
<i>so let's do it.</i>

19:10.215 --> 19:11.350
<i>- Right now?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

19:11.450 --> 19:12.551
<i>I know</i>
<i>it's kind of last minute,</i>

19:12.651 --> 19:14.052
<i>but I have a surprise for you.</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:16.121
<i>- A bigger surprise than</i>
<i>finding out you have a wife?</i>

19:16.188 --> 19:17.656
<i>- Seriously?</i>
<i>You're gonna weaponize</i>

19:17.723 --> 19:20.025
<i>the joyful word "surprise"</i>
<i>like that?</i>

19:20.125 --> 19:21.827
<i>I'll pick you up</i>
<i>outside your dorm in ten.</i>

19:21.894 --> 19:24.363
<i>Just bundle up</i>
<i>and bring bug spray.</i>

19:24.463 --> 19:26.165
<i>- Bug spray?</i>
<i>- It's gonna be fun!</i>

19:26.231 --> 19:28.967
<i>Just forget I said "bug spray."</i>

19:29.034 --> 19:30.402
<i>Long underwear might be smart.</i>

19:30.502 --> 19:32.171
<i>Bro, it's getting worse.</i>

19:32.237 --> 19:34.039
<i>- It's gonna be great.</i>
<i>Just let me do my thing.</i>

19:34.139 --> 19:35.474
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

19:38.844 --> 19:40.546
<i>Bug spray.</i>

20:00.566 --> 20:02.434
<i>- Oh, hi.</i>
<i>Is Nico home?</i>

20:02.534 --> 20:04.937
<i>- Nah, I think he's watching</i>
<i>the basketball game</i>

20:05.037 --> 20:06.205
<i>at Braden's.</i>

20:06.271 --> 20:08.674
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- You don't know Braden?</i>

20:08.740 --> 20:11.843
<i>That's weird.</i>
<i>You kind of look like him.</i>

20:11.910 --> 20:13.946
<i>- Uh, okay.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

20:14.046 --> 20:16.181
<i>- Hey, you don't also have</i>
<i>a Postmates order</i>

20:16.248 --> 20:18.217
<i>from Quiznos, do you?</i>

20:18.283 --> 20:19.618
<i>I do not.</i>

20:21.587 --> 20:23.422
<i>She wasn't Quiznos.</i>

20:30.028 --> 20:31.396
<i>Hey. What's up?</i>

20:31.463 --> 20:33.632
<i>Hey. I'm at Theta Delt.</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:35.701
<i>Oh, cool.</i>

20:35.767 --> 20:39.805
<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>
<i>Except you're not here.</i>

20:39.905 --> 20:41.640
<i>Aw, shit.</i>

20:41.740 --> 20:44.309
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I totally forgot.</i>

20:44.409 --> 20:45.744
<i>The "Golden Girls" thing.</i>

20:45.811 --> 20:46.912
<i>Ugh.</i>

20:46.979 --> 20:49.815
<i>Uh, can we do it</i>
<i>some other time?</i>

20:49.915 --> 20:51.250
<i>- Um, yeah.</i>
<i>For sure.</i>

20:51.316 --> 20:53.986
<i>I have other things</i>
<i>to do tonight anyway.</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:56.221
<i>All right. Sorry.</i>

20:56.288 --> 20:57.656
<i>Uh, bye.</i>

21:25.751 --> 21:26.852
<i>All right.</i>

21:28.687 --> 21:29.855
<i>- You better not</i>
<i>be murdering me.</i>

21:29.955 --> 21:31.290
<i>I will be so pissed.</i>

21:31.356 --> 21:32.591
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

21:32.658 --> 21:34.760
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Okay. Watch your step.</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:37.329
<i>All right.</i>

21:45.203 --> 21:47.205
<i>Well?</i>

21:47.306 --> 21:49.174
<i>What am I looking at?</i>

21:49.274 --> 21:51.977
<i>- It's a romantic</i>
<i>outdoor movie night!</i>

21:52.044 --> 21:54.479
<i>Just you and me</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

21:54.546 --> 21:57.449
<i>"Love & Basketball" queued up</i>
<i>on the projector.</i>

21:57.516 --> 22:00.852
<i>- That is my favorite movie.</i>
<i>- I know. I did my research.</i>

22:00.952 --> 22:02.888
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Let me show you to your seat.</i>

22:02.988 --> 22:05.057
<i>- Ooh.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

22:05.157 --> 22:06.658
- <i>Just--</i>
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>

22:06.725 --> 22:09.061
<i>- Emergency exits are this way</i>
<i>in the woods,</i>

22:09.161 --> 22:10.529
<i>and the other way in the woods.</i>

22:10.629 --> 22:13.031
<i>And the lavatories are</i>
<i>anywhere you want.</i>

22:13.131 --> 22:14.333
<i>This is very cute.</i>

22:14.399 --> 22:15.834
<i>I know.</i>

22:18.236 --> 22:19.471
- <i>You ready?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

22:21.206 --> 22:25.410
<i>Okay, now, cell phones off</i>
<i>for the duration of the movie.</i>

22:25.510 --> 22:27.412
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Tonight is just about you,</i>

22:27.512 --> 22:30.382
<i>and me, and the present threat</i>
<i>of Lyme disease.</i>

22:37.889 --> 22:39.691
<i>- Look, I know you're in charge</i>
<i>or whatever,</i>

22:39.758 --> 22:41.660
<i>but I really think</i>
<i>it would benefit you</i>

22:41.727 --> 22:43.662
<i>to take things</i>
<i>a little less seriously.</i>

22:43.729 --> 22:46.264
<i>- Oh, it would, huh?</i>
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

22:46.365 --> 22:49.000
<i>Like, if you didn't notice the</i>
<i>song that girl sang was beyond</i>

22:49.067 --> 22:51.370
<i>terrible, then I am genuinely</i>
<i>kind of worried about you.</i>

22:51.436 --> 22:53.605
<i>- Of course,</i>
<i>I knew it was terrible.</i>

22:53.705 --> 22:57.342
<i>If she was good, she wouldn't</i>
<i>be playing the Women's Center!</i>

22:57.409 --> 22:59.277
<i>- Uh, yes.</i>
<i>I agree!</i>

22:59.378 --> 23:01.413
<i>- Look, can some of</i>
<i>these people be intolerable?</i>

23:01.513 --> 23:03.014
<i>Holy shit, yes.</i>

23:03.081 --> 23:05.384
<i>But instead of being rude,</i>
<i>I act like a normal person.</i>

23:05.450 --> 23:08.920
<i>I smile to their face,</i>
<i>and then I mock them privately.</i>

23:09.020 --> 23:11.223
<i>Could you maybe try that?</i>

23:11.289 --> 23:12.624
<i>All right.</i>

23:12.724 --> 23:15.193
<i>All right, I will try</i>
<i>to be less of a, um--</i>

23:15.260 --> 23:16.595
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>What did you call it?</i>

23:16.695 --> 23:18.096
- <i>A dumb, cis bitch.</i>
<i>- A dumb, cis bitch.</i>

23:18.196 --> 23:20.432
<i>- Right. That's the one.</i>
<i>- Might be hard, though.</i>

23:20.532 --> 23:24.302
<i>Wait till October when Ginger</i>
<i>starts talking about her coven.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:26.037
<i>What the fuck is a coven?</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:36.548
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

23:36.615 --> 23:38.083
<i>Um, nothing.</i>

23:38.150 --> 23:40.218
<i>- I thought we were gonna</i>
<i>clean that together tomorrow.</i>

23:40.285 --> 23:43.054
<i>- It's fine.</i>
<i>I needed the distraction.</i>

23:43.121 --> 23:44.790
<i>- Anything you want</i>
<i>to talk about?</i>

23:46.124 --> 23:47.826
<i>- I just got my hopes up</i>
<i>about a guy</i>

23:47.926 --> 23:50.495
<i>and wasted 25 bucks</i>
<i>on a cake.</i>

23:51.496 --> 23:54.399
<i>What about you? Did you</i>
<i>break up with your abs boy?</i>

23:54.466 --> 23:57.235
<i>- Yeah, I told him</i>
<i>it wasn't working.</i>

23:57.302 --> 23:59.571
<i>But then he was doing pull-ups,</i>
<i>so we had sex one more time.</i>

23:59.638 --> 24:01.440
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I might just keep doing it.</i>

24:01.506 --> 24:03.575
- <i>It's good.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

24:03.642 --> 24:06.478
<i>- So tell me: what heinous food</i>
<i>was causing the smell?</i>

24:06.578 --> 24:09.281
<i>- All of it.</i>
<i>It was unplugged.</i>

24:09.347 --> 24:11.016
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

24:11.116 --> 24:13.518
<i>I totally unplugged it</i>
<i>for Travis' airbrush machine.</i>

24:13.618 --> 24:17.189
<i>I hate that this was my fault</i>
<i>and it wasn't racism.</i>

24:19.090 --> 24:21.493
<i>- You wanna watch TV and eat</i>
<i>an entire cheesecake with me?</i>

24:21.593 --> 24:23.662
<i>- Let's do it.</i>
<i>That looks good.</i>

24:23.762 --> 24:25.764
<i>Right?</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:32.204
<i>This is the single best date</i>
<i>I have ever been on.</i>

24:32.304 --> 24:33.271
<i>Me too.</i>

24:36.875 --> 24:39.778
<i>- Just check your phone.</i>
<i>We both heard it.</i>

24:46.351 --> 24:48.487
<i>- Wanna read it?</i>

24:57.796 --> 24:59.664
<i>You're serious?</i>

24:59.731 --> 25:01.500
- <i>This is real.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

25:12.511 --> 25:14.880
<i>Okay.</i>

25:14.980 --> 25:16.481
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

25:16.548 --> 25:18.149
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:36.535
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

25:36.601 --> 25:40.438
<i>Uh, I got your text.</i>

25:40.539 --> 25:44.109
<i>What is this important thing</i>
<i>you want to talk about?</i>

25:44.209 --> 25:45.410
<i>Oh, I'm so dumb.</i>

25:45.510 --> 25:47.345
<i>I meant to send that</i>
<i>to Coach Woods.</i>

25:47.412 --> 25:49.347
<i>It was just some soccer stuff.</i>

25:52.117 --> 25:53.919
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Ready for bed?</i>

27:25.810 --> 27:26.945
<i>Go to bed.</i>
