07:06.227 --> 07:07.931
None of my tribe knew.

07:10.042 --> 07:14.017
When the moon became
full, I would steal away

07:14.042 --> 07:17.282
and I would find the enemy's camp.

07:17.307 --> 07:20.614
And I would wait for
the wolf to devour me.

07:22.164 --> 07:26.674
I believed that this was
a great gift from God.

07:27.349 --> 07:29.253

About a man with a true heart.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.539
A son.

07:56.249 --> 08:00.391
And only then did I
understand my true purpose.

08:01.571 --> 08:03.340
It was not to save my people.

08:03.365 --> 08:06.673
It was to give you the
power to save all people.

08:09.506 --> 08:11.009
You did this to me?

08:13.757 --> 08:15.588

09:06.458 --> 09:08.228
The pain you carry.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.971
But all your life you
have run from this pain.

09:12.972 --> 09:14.574
You ran from your father.

and planted my seed in unworthy whores.

16:46.512 --> 16:47.680
Alone.

16:53.291 --> 16:56.497
But after a time you'll lose the
desire for passion entirely...

16:58.836 --> 17:01.073
for connection with anyone.

17:01.659 --> 17:04.799
Like a muscle that atrophies
from lack of use.

17:06.852 --> 17:08.320
And one day

17:10.258 --> 17:12.496
you'll realize you've become like them.

17:15.670 --> 17:17.540
Beautiful and dead.

17:19.974 --> 17:21.679
You have become a perfect,

17:22.082 --> 17:24.420
unchanging portrait of yourself.

17:28.127 --> 17:30.332
An eternity without passion?

17:31.467 --> 17:34.674
Without affection? Caring for nothing?

17:38.916 --> 17:42.089
Small price to pay for such
immortal perfection, isn't it?

18:14.788 --> 18:16.023
Goodbye, Dorian.

18:20.487 --> 18:22.524
I hope they watch over you.

18:26.645 --> 18:28.314
You'll be back.

18:33.124 --> 18:34.561
And I'll be here.

18:39.537 --> 18:41.140
I'll always be here.

19:08.394 --> 19:11.199
DR. JEKYLL: You are painfully
true to form in every instant.

19:11.224 --> 19:13.782
Weak and sentimental as
you have always been!

19:13.807 --> 19:15.096
I should never have left
you alone with her!

19:15.121 --> 19:16.891
It was a monstrous idea!

19:17.150 --> 19:18.227
We're well out of it!

19:18.252 --> 19:19.352
Fine words from you,

19:19.377 --> 19:22.104
who traffics in stolen
corpses and dead flesh!

19:22.150 --> 19:23.552
Oh, I'll show you monsters, Victor!

19:23.718 --> 19:25.690
Walk down that corridor
and open any door.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.868
"Monstrous" you may call it,

19:27.900 --> 19:29.269
but I'll continue my work

19:29.558 --> 19:31.997
until I cure every inmate
in this wretched place.

19:32.075 --> 19:33.463
And then you'd be happy?

19:33.862 --> 19:35.314
And then you'd get the
acclaim and affection

19:35.315 --> 19:36.449
that's eluded you your whole life?

19:36.450 --> 19:37.815
Yes!

19:37.885 --> 19:40.457
If you think scientific achievement

19:40.605 --> 19:43.543
will bring you acceptance
or even esteem,

19:43.861 --> 19:46.408
an entree into proper society,

19:46.761 --> 19:48.364
you're deluding yourself.

19:49.577 --> 19:51.247
That's not the world we live in.

19:52.249 --> 19:54.854
I create my own world.

19:55.488 --> 19:57.158
I create my own self.

19:59.196 --> 20:00.598
And one day,

20:00.599 --> 20:02.776
one day, all of you will understand

20:03.048 --> 20:05.186
that of which I am capable.

20:07.613 --> 20:08.815
I'm sorry, Henry.

20:09.784 --> 20:12.389
It's a dark road ahead for you, I fear.

20:15.461 --> 20:17.065
And for you, old man?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.168
(SIGHING)

20:19.169 --> 20:21.106
There is no road ahead for me.

20:23.745 --> 20:26.150
There will always be a place
for you here, Victor,

20:27.213 --> 20:28.750
in the heart of science.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.702
Now, it is time for my rounds.

20:35.703 --> 20:37.372
Good day, my friend.

20:39.544 --> 20:40.980
Oh, there is one thing more.

20:42.148 --> 20:43.919
This day is not a total loss for me.

20:44.821 --> 20:46.891
My hateful father has died, you see.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.169
At long last,

20:53.170 --> 20:56.443
the estate and the title
are finally mine.

20:59.349 --> 21:02.322
So I'm not so far from the
aristocracy as you might think.

21:04.627 --> 21:07.265
Then I should properly
call you by your title.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.504
It seems only fitting.

21:12.244 --> 21:13.714
Good day then...

21:15.268 --> 21:16.570
Lord Hyde.

21:34.352 --> 21:36.456
DR. SEWARD: <i>What do we see now?</i>

21:36.457 --> 21:38.895
The alley by the spice
market is where we turn.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.365
(GASPS)

21:41.366 --> 21:45.675
(SNIFFING) Ah, can you smell it now?

21:45.676 --> 21:46.878
What?

21:47.680 --> 21:49.316
The rotting corpses.

21:49.984 --> 21:52.790
This was a slaughterhouse
in days long past.

21:55.294 --> 21:57.765
They butchered so many poor animals.

21:57.766 --> 21:59.670
I can still hear them screaming.

22:00.776 --> 22:02.513
I can still see them hanging there.

22:03.477 --> 22:06.960
And the blood. The torrents of blood.

22:06.985 --> 22:09.189
And your master, is he here?

22:11.506 --> 22:13.075
Do you not feel him?

22:13.698 --> 22:15.636
And where is Vanessa?

22:16.270 --> 22:17.672
With him.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.577
They're in love, Doctor.

22:22.415 --> 22:24.286
Have you ever been in love?

22:24.820 --> 22:25.656
Where is she?

22:25.681 --> 22:27.885
I don't think I've ever been in love.

22:28.008 --> 22:30.012
And now I probably never will be.

22:31.568 --> 22:33.437
Do you love me, Doctor?

22:40.586 --> 22:42.222
Renfield.

22:42.353 --> 22:44.658
Mr. Renfield. Come back to me now.

22:44.683 --> 22:45.685
- Wake up.
- (RENFIELD GASPS)

22:48.500 --> 22:50.137
I know where she is.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.855
By now, Mr. Chandler must
be back at the house.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.283
Sir Malcolm!

22:58.469 --> 23:00.238
Good God, it's Doctor Frankenstein.

23:00.263 --> 23:01.667
What are you doing here of all places?

23:01.728 --> 23:03.397
Later. I'll explain later.

23:03.664 --> 23:04.741
But will you come with us now?

23:04.766 --> 23:06.803
- Vanessa's in danger.
- Yes, of course.

23:06.804 --> 23:09.877
We've got to meet Ethan. We
haven't a moment to lose.

23:15.254 --> 23:16.791
(MAN COUGHING)

23:25.676 --> 23:29.751
He seems smaller, does he not?

23:32.790 --> 23:35.796
Like a bird more than a child.

23:37.408 --> 23:41.653
With such delicate, thin bones.

23:44.792 --> 23:48.667
And skin like a Chinese paper lantern.

23:51.508 --> 23:54.079
When I was dressing him
in his Sunday clothes,

23:56.036 --> 23:58.575
and even those so threadbare and meager,

24:01.079 --> 24:03.216
I thought, "How is it possible

24:03.217 --> 24:06.189
that life could be so
cruel to one so young?"

24:09.797 --> 24:11.365
He had not enough years in him

24:11.366 --> 24:12.770
to suffer so mightily.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.289
But it is ever so.

24:21.186 --> 24:23.490
Flint is the heart of the world.

24:30.697 --> 24:32.100
Spend your time with him.

24:35.466 --> 24:37.704
I'll arrange for the
funerary men to come.

24:39.489 --> 24:41.761
He'll have a proper burial, at least.

24:43.865 --> 24:45.868
The dignity he was denied in life

24:45.869 --> 24:47.305
will be his in death.

24:48.073 --> 24:49.275
MARJORIE: <i>No.</i>

24:51.714 --> 24:52.950
CREATURE: I'm sorry?

24:53.818 --> 24:55.020
No.

24:56.524 --> 24:58.060
I don't want him buried.

25:00.565 --> 25:02.034
Marjorie, it must be done.

25:04.305 --> 25:07.478
Hold his hand now and
make your farewells.

25:08.413 --> 25:09.617
Why should I?

25:11.219 --> 25:12.890
Why should either of us?

25:15.762 --> 25:17.766
He's not lost to us yet.

25:22.643 --> 25:25.473
Take him to Doctor Frankenstein.

25:26.445 --> 25:28.248
Let him perform his miracles.

25:29.188 --> 25:31.594
He will bring our son back.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.333
You don't know what you're saying.

25:35.334 --> 25:38.172
He pulled you from the grave
and brought you back to us.

25:38.173 --> 25:39.777
He can do the same for Jack.

25:40.712 --> 25:43.115
We can love our son again, husband!

25:43.116 --> 25:45.521
- Don't ask this.
- He can live again!

25:45.522 --> 25:48.393
- Don't even think it!
- I will have my son back!

25:49.530 --> 25:51.066
(SOBBING) I will love him again,

25:52.234 --> 25:55.274
love him better, and stronger,

25:56.009 --> 26:00.584
and he will not get sick
and he will not bleed

26:00.585 --> 26:02.254
and he will not die!

26:03.297 --> 26:05.209
Let me love him again!

26:05.595 --> 26:08.467
And have all the humanity
burned out of him?

26:09.903 --> 26:14.112
To become an unholy freak as
he who stands before you?

26:15.949 --> 26:18.320
I see the husband who I love, no other.

26:18.461 --> 26:19.798
You see a monster.

26:21.292 --> 26:24.331
A grisly undead thing.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.602
That is what I am.

26:26.804 --> 26:28.707
That is what Dr. Frankenstein

26:28.708 --> 26:29.976
has made of me.

26:29.977 --> 26:32.048
Only because you believe it so.

26:33.353 --> 26:35.222
He can live again.

26:36.657 --> 26:38.326
(SOFTLY) Don't ask this.

26:40.799 --> 26:42.736
To make him suffer as I did?

26:44.439 --> 26:45.909
Those little bones?

26:47.913 --> 26:49.148
That face?

26:51.486 --> 26:57.230
To become something so
unnatural, so hated.

26:57.231 --> 26:58.333
No.

27:00.304 --> 27:01.439
Please.

27:04.345 --> 27:05.715
Hear me now.

27:07.552 --> 27:09.188
Take him from this place.

27:10.692 --> 27:15.033
Return with him alive,
or don't return at all.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.343
I could not bear to look at your face

27:20.344 --> 27:22.380
if you let him remain like that

27:22.381 --> 27:24.018
when you could save him.

27:26.991 --> 27:28.126
Marjorie.

27:32.301 --> 27:33.805
Bring him back as he was,

27:35.909 --> 27:38.614
or turn from this house forever.

28:18.368 --> 28:19.804
This is it?

28:19.805 --> 28:22.535
According to the old maps, the
slaughterhouse is down that alley.

28:23.303 --> 28:26.527
This whole block's been condemned,
so God knows what we'll discover.

28:26.825 --> 28:27.821
But whatever happens...

28:27.846 --> 28:30.416
Find Vanessa. That's all that matters.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.786
Yes.

28:31.787 --> 28:33.590
You take the front.

28:33.591 --> 28:35.528
Kaetenay and I will find our own way in.

28:36.095 --> 28:37.632
SIR MALCOLM: You're sure that's wise?

28:38.500 --> 28:39.903
We work best alone.

28:42.943 --> 28:46.081
It has been an honor to hunt with you.

28:46.082 --> 28:49.823
You would have made a mighty Apache.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.027
I had a mighty teacher.

28:53.496 --> 28:54.733
Good luck.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.882
You all know what we're facing.

29:06.189 --> 29:08.960
Dr. Seward, we can't
look after you inside.

29:08.961 --> 29:10.764
I'm a New Yorker, Sir Malcolm.

29:10.765 --> 29:13.236

- Where is she?
- She is no longer yours.

31:57.297 --> 31:59.367
- Leave this place.
- Where is Vanessa?

31:59.368 --> 32:01.439
She's not yours! She's mine!

32:06.983 --> 32:08.119

Yes.

33:01.593 --> 33:02.662
Why?

33:03.496 --> 33:06.035
She was meant to bring Vanessa to me.

33:07.270 --> 33:10.442

no more than that?

No more than that.

38:25.288 --> 38:28.562
Look at me. This is what I am.

38:28.587 --> 38:31.125
And this is what I've done.

38:31.150 --> 38:34.256
Brought this terrible
darkness to the world.

38:35.894 --> 38:37.063
Vanessa.

38:40.002 --> 38:41.304
Please.

38:42.140 --> 38:43.442
Vanessa.

38:44.912 --> 38:46.181
And where is she?

38:46.983 --> 38:49.722
When did we lose her, Ethan?

38:51.258 --> 38:53.460
She was standing in a quiet room,

38:53.796 --> 38:55.766
gazing up at a cross.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.506
She reached out, took
it from the wall...

39:00.142 --> 39:02.413
and put it in the fire.

39:05.486 --> 39:07.558
And then she was lost.

39:08.626 --> 39:10.329
And so alone.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.937
You are not alone.

39:14.638 --> 39:15.974
You never were.

39:18.212 --> 39:20.382
I have stood at the very edge.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.690
I have looked into the abyss.

39:24.357 --> 39:27.998
If I'd taken one more step,
I would have fallen.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.674
But no matter how far
I ran away from God,

39:34.143 --> 39:36.682
he was still waiting ahead.

39:40.122 --> 39:42.961
- Not for me.
- For us all.

39:50.476 --> 39:52.380
My battle must end.

39:52.948 --> 39:54.217
You know that.

39:54.991 --> 39:57.288
Or there will never be peace on Earth.

40:00.187 --> 40:02.025
Let it end.

40:07.310 --> 40:08.712
Don't ask it.

40:08.713 --> 40:10.280
I don't have to.

40:10.391 --> 40:12.361
You know you have a destiny.

40:12.386 --> 40:14.189
It's why we first met.

40:14.190 --> 40:16.127
It's why you're here now.

40:16.321 --> 40:18.808
You must help me defeat
the forces of darkness

40:18.833 --> 40:21.470
and deny them their prize for all time.

40:21.471 --> 40:22.574
No!

40:26.414 --> 40:29.835
Please... Ethan.

40:30.189 --> 40:31.792
(SOBBING SOFTLY)

40:32.794 --> 40:34.263
Let it end.

40:59.848 --> 41:01.251
With a kiss.

41:04.257 --> 41:05.760
(SLOWLY) With a kiss.

41:11.295 --> 41:12.632
With love.

41:15.045 --> 41:16.381
With love.

41:40.938 --> 41:42.423
Our Father,

41:44.605 --> 41:46.306
who art in Heaven,

41:46.307 --> 41:48.646
- Hallowed be thy name.
- (MOUTHING)

41:50.148 --> 41:51.652
Thy Kingdom come...

41:52.353 --> 41:53.837
(BOTH) Thy will be done,

41:54.427 --> 41:56.699
on Earth as it is in heaven.

41:58.398 --> 42:00.985
Give us this day our daily bread,

42:01.559 --> 42:03.821
and forgive us our trespasses.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.462
As we forgive those who
trespass against us.

42:08.355 --> 42:11.294
(SNIFFLING) Lead us not into temptation,

42:11.692 --> 42:13.461
but deliver us from evil.

42:14.297 --> 42:16.415
For thine is the Kingdom,

42:17.044 --> 42:19.550
and the Power and the Glory,

42:20.440 --> 42:22.612
for ever and ever.

42:23.883 --> 42:25.152
Amen.

42:29.795 --> 42:30.930
(GUN FIRES)

42:41.752 --> 42:43.388
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:51.434 --> 42:52.870
Oh, Ethan...

42:56.615 --> 42:57.917
I see...

43:01.475 --> 43:02.911
our Lord.

43:27.276 --> 43:29.046
(CHOKING)

43:32.554 --> 43:34.156
(GASPING)

43:37.897 --> 43:39.467
(MUMBLES AND GASPS)

45:39.206 --> 45:40.910
SIR MALCOLM: In India,

45:42.947 --> 45:44.349
where I traveled,

45:44.529 --> 45:47.035
they have such colorful gods.

45:48.264 --> 45:49.800
A dozen blue arms.

45:51.438 --> 45:52.875
And bejeweled.

45:53.936 --> 45:57.910
A dazzling and exhausting
panorama of life.

45:59.514 --> 46:02.319
Of lives lived again and again.

46:04.732 --> 46:07.304
Of reincarnated souls.

46:09.675 --> 46:12.013
Do you think such a thing is possible?

46:13.188 --> 46:15.326
It would be cruel for
her to suffer more.

46:18.017 --> 46:19.386
She's at peace.

46:21.290 --> 46:22.927
FRANKENSTEIN: Yes.

46:24.864 --> 46:26.333
You're right.

46:30.094 --> 46:31.498
Dear Miss Ives.

46:44.390 --> 46:45.827
(SIGHS) I'll see you tomorrow then.

46:46.608 --> 46:47.944
Thank you, Doctor...

46:50.048 --> 46:51.083
Victor.

47:13.327 --> 47:14.864
(WHISPERING) Is he all right?

47:16.167 --> 47:17.269
He will be.

47:17.904 --> 47:19.339
And you?

47:26.086 --> 47:27.322
(SIGHING)

47:42.987 --> 47:44.691
(DOOR OPENS)

47:48.064 --> 47:49.567
(DOOR CLOSES)

48:53.929 --> 48:55.799
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

49:14.537 --> 49:15.806
(SIGHS)

49:21.537 --> 49:23.013
And what now?

49:25.337 --> 49:26.810
(SIGHING) Yeah.

49:29.065 --> 49:31.403
Never have I so wanted to run away.

49:34.161 --> 49:37.702
On some hunt or expedition
to Africa, India.

49:40.923 --> 49:42.693
Anywhere but here.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.170
- Will you?
- No.

49:49.545 --> 49:51.716
I must find my life without her.

49:54.316 --> 49:57.388
Miss Ives was the last
link to who I was.

49:59.226 --> 50:02.419
I must find out who I
am yet going to be.

50:05.453 --> 50:07.089
Oh, I will miss her

50:09.279 --> 50:10.916
to my bones.

50:18.234 --> 50:19.804
Will you stay, Ethan?

50:26.225 --> 50:27.761
You're my family.

51:55.696 --> 51:59.804
