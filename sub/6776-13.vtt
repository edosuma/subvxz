02:05.030 --> 02:09.649
( music on radio playing )

02:11.500 --> 02:13.229
( shutting off radio )

02:18.060 --> 02:20.893
WOW, SHE REALLY
LOOKS LIKE NATE.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.720
LET ME SEE ?

02:25.160 --> 02:26.650
CLAIRE,
THEY'RE IN ORDER.

02:26.660 --> 02:29.197
DO VEGANS
BREAST FEED ?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.724
YOU GOT BUTTER
ON IT !

02:30.730 --> 02:32.152
SORRY, MOM,

02:32.160 --> 02:34.321
I KNOW YOU ONLY HAVE
2,000 OTHER ONES JUST LIKE IT.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.026
BUT THIS ONE WAS THE FIRST TIME
SHE EVER SMILED AT ME.

02:37.030 --> 02:38.793
YOU SURE
IT WASN'T GAS ?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.324
OH, NO, I KNOW GAS,
NATE WAS--

02:40.330 --> 02:43.094
"AN EXTREMELY
GASSY BABY," WE KNOW.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.852
"AND DAVID
NEVER MADE A PEEP."

02:44.860 --> 02:47.226
AND NO ONE REMEMBERS
ANYTHING ABOUT CLAIRE.

02:47.230 --> 02:50.119
I'M STARTING TO THINK I JUST
WALKED IN OFF THE STREET

02:50.130 --> 02:51.324
WHEN I WAS NINE.

02:51.330 --> 02:52.854
OH, THAT'S
NOT TRUE, DEAR.

02:52.860 --> 02:55.499
OH, DAVID, CLAIRE'S GRADUATION
IS THIS SATURDAY AT TH REE.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.752
DID YOU HEAR THAT, NATE,
SATURDAY AT TH REE ?

02:57.760 --> 02:59.022
FOR WHAT ?

02:59.030 --> 03:01.692
MY IDIOTIC GRADUATION,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

03:01.700 --> 03:02.826
OF COURSE HE DOES.

03:02.830 --> 03:04.195
WHAT'S THAT ?

03:04.200 --> 03:06.555
JUST A FEW PICTURES
OF MAYA.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.528
WOW.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.555
SHE'S...

03:15.560 --> 03:17.858
WAIT, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN SEEN HER ?

03:17.860 --> 03:19.919
YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
THAT I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED

03:19.930 --> 03:21.557
TO HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS KID,

03:21.560 --> 03:23.027
AND YOU'RE OVER THERE
TAKING PICTURES.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.190
SIGNING AWAY
YOUR CUSTODIAL RIGHTS

03:24.200 --> 03:25.451
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T VISIT.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.654
YEAH, IS THIS
COMING FROM LISA ?

03:26.660 --> 03:27.888
I'M NOT GE'I'I'ING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.357
YEAH, WELL THEN DON'T,
STAY OUT OF IT !

03:30.600 --> 03:33.057
WHATEVER PROBLEMS
YOU AND LISA HAVE,
I DON'T CARE.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.755
BUT MAYA IS
MY GRANDDAUGHTER

03:34.760 --> 03:36.398

( door slamming )

03:41.030 --> 03:43.157
(tires screeching )

03:43.430 --> 03:45.489
( car horns honking )

03:51.900 --> 03:54.152
HEY.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.149
YOU OKAY ?

03:58.160 --> 04:01.049
GO AWAY.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.529
LET ME GET
SOMEONE FOR YOU.

04:07.530 --> 04:10.249
THEY CAN'T HELP ME !

04:10.260 --> 04:12.399
( coughing )

04:18.460 --> 04:21.725
I GOT IT, I GOT IT,
I GOT IT.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.823
OKAY.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.499
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ME.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.592
SHH, IT'S OKAY.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.828
IT'S OKAY.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.650
YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS
TO BE OVER.

04:32.660 --> 04:35.959
I'M RIGHT HERE
FOR YOU.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.427
SO WHAT ?

04:37.430 --> 04:40.695
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

04:42.330 --> 04:44.594
OH, FUCK !

04:44.600 --> 04:47.524
I CAN'T BREATHE.

04:47.530 --> 04:48.758
SHH.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.557
I'M NOT READY !

04:50.560 --> 04:53.358
HELP ME !

04:53.360 --> 04:55.749
IT'S GONNA
BE OKAY.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.591
( gasping )

04:57.600 --> 04:59.955
JUST...

04:59.960 --> 05:03.225
JUST TRY TO LET GO.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.619
AND GO INTO THE LIGHT ?

05:05.630 --> 05:08.292
THERE'S NO
FUCKING LIGHT !

05:08.300 --> 05:10.621
PLEASE,
PLEASE, JUST...

05:10.630 --> 05:13.292
JUST TRY
TO LET GO.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.154
I DON'T WANT TO.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.627
JUST LET IT GO.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.188
JUST LET IT GO.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.328
IT'S GONNA
BE OKAY.

05:21.330 --> 05:23.298
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.790
IT'S OKAY.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.698
IT'S OKAY.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.849
IT'S OKAY.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.322
IT'S OKAY.

05:32.630 --> 05:33.619
IT'S OKAY.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.497
IT'S OKAY.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.419
IT'S OKAY.

05:49.030 --> 05:52.056
YES, I NEED TO SEE DR. DIPAOLO
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

05:53.530 --> 05:55.521
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT TWO WEEKS,
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

05:55.530 --> 05:58.351
( door opening )
I HAVE TO SCHEDULE
AN EMBOLIZATION.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.227
NO, BUT--

06:01.230 --> 06:04.529
I THINK I WAITED TOO LONG
ALREADY, ALRIGHT ?

06:04.530 --> 06:05.849
I HAVE TO FUCKING
DO THIS !

06:05.860 --> 06:07.521
NATE, THIS IS
JOHN GERSON.

06:07.530 --> 06:09.748
THANK YOU,
TOMORROW AT 11.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.899
YES, THANK YOU.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.197
BITCH.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.758
FROM THE DCA.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.921
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND
YOUR PREMISES IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:16.930 --> 06:19.057
WE DON'T HAVE AN INSPECTION
SCHEDULED 'TIL FEBRUARY.

06:19.060 --> 06:20.550
WE RECEIVED
A COMPLAINT.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.198
FROM WHO ?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.690
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY
TO SAY.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.588
IF I COULD JUST
USE YOUR LI'I'I'LE BOYS' ROOM,

06:25.600 --> 06:27.249
THEN WE'LL GET STARTED
WITH YOUR BILLING RECORDS.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.558
IT'S THAT DOOR
DIRECTLY ACROSS.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.628
I THOUGHT
KROEHNER FOLDED.

06:35.630 --> 06:38.622
THIS MUST BE THE FINAL MIND-FUCK
OF MITZI DALTON HUNTLEY.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.249
( female )
CLAIRE FISHER ?

07:27.400 --> 07:31.188
FIRST WHEN
THERE'S NOTHING

07:31.200 --> 07:35.796
BUT A SLOW
GLOWING DREAM

07:37.430 --> 07:40.593
CAN I START AGAIN ?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.189
FUCK.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.453
CLAIRE ?

07:58.460 --> 08:00.451
CLAIRE ?!

08:11.730 --> 08:15.097
SO, I HAD THIS IDEA WE SHOULD
PUT A POOL IN THE BACKYARD--

08:15.100 --> 08:16.249
CAREFUL OF
THE PUDDLE.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.727
THAT'S NASTY.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.893
A LITTLE KIDNEY-SHAPED POOL,
WE CAN DIP IN THE SUMMER ?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.424
IT'S NOT EVEN
THAT EXPENSIVE.

08:22.430 --> 08:24.557
WE'RE PAYING BACK
YOUR SISTER.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.950
SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO BE PAID BACK.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.052
SHE DOESN'T
EVEN WANT IT.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.925
THE ONLY TIME YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE PAID BACK

08:30.930 --> 08:33.194
IS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE
SOMETHING OVER SOMEONE.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.724
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE'S GETTING PAID

08:34.730 --> 08:37.358
TO BE THAT SLUTTY NEIGHBOR
ON THE "WB" ?

08:38.600 --> 08:39.726
WHERE'S MY
HOT SAUCE ?

08:39.730 --> 08:41.459
IT'S ALREADY
ON THERE.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.325
I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T GET
ONE THING NICE FOR OURSELVES.

08:43.330 --> 08:46.254
SHH, DON'T TALK ABOUT
THE MONEY IN FRONT OF THEM.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.319
GET RID OF
THE FOOD !

08:52.100 --> 08:54.989
JEEZ, I HOPE I DIDN'T
INTERRUPT YOUR LUNCH.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.649
I'M SURE
THEY WEREN'T EATING.

08:56.660 --> 09:00.426
THIS IS OUR EMBALMER'S WIFE,
SHE WAS JUST STOPPING BY.

09:00.430 --> 09:02.625
DOES SHE HAVE A LICENSE
TO BE DOWN HERE ?

09:17.060 --> 09:19.699
SHOULDN'T MR. BUCHBINDER
BE IN THE REFRIGERATOR ?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.658
I'M JUST ABOUT TO TAKE HIM
TO THE CREMATORIUM.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.628
REALLY ?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.655
'CAUSE IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF

09:26.660 --> 09:29.390
A NO VACANCY SITUATION
AT THE FRIDGE MOTEL.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.027
BUT HE'S NOT
EVEN STAYING HERE.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.895
I'D LOVE TO LET YOU
SLIDE ON THIS,

09:32.900 --> 09:35.198
BUT SEEING AS MR. BUCHBINDER
PAID FOR TWO DAYS

09:35.200 --> 09:36.827
OF REFRIGERATION
IN HIS PRE-NEED CONTRACT,

09:36.830 --> 09:38.092
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO WRITE YOU UP

09:38.100 --> 09:39.852
FOR A CONSUMER
DISCLOSURE CITATION.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.829
AND...

09:48.460 --> 09:51.623
WE ARE KNEE DEEP
IN HUMAN WASTE.

10:00.860 --> 10:03.328
WHY DID YOUR GRADES TAKE
SUCH A PLUNGE IN THE SPRING ?

10:03.330 --> 10:06.254
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

10:06.260 --> 10:08.353
I GUESS I SORT OF STOPPED
RELATING TO HIGH SCHOOL.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.225
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN LAST YEAR ?

10:10.230 --> 10:12.949
UH...

10:12.960 --> 10:14.359
WELL, BAD BOYFRIEND.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.624
OH, OKAY.

10:16.630 --> 10:21.420
WELL, THAT'S IT,
UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

10:21.430 --> 10:23.421
OR ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE US TO KNOW.

10:29.030 --> 10:32.090
WELL, GOOD LUCK, CLAIRE,
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:32.100 --> 10:36.218
ALSO, NOT THAT
THIS IS WHATEVER,

10:36.230 --> 10:40.018
BUT MY FATHER
DIED LAST YEAR.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.691
I'M SORRY.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.123
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH

10:44.130 --> 10:47.952
GETTING BAD GRADES, BUT I MEAN,
MAYBE IT DID A LITTLE.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.598
IT WOULD IF
IT WERE ME.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.329
THANK YOU FOR
LETTING ME KNOW.

10:51.330 --> 10:54.754
I'M NOT LIKE,
"POOR ME" OR ANYTHING.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.693
YOU KNOW, I JUST
THOUGHT OF THIS,

10:58.700 --> 11:01.589
BUT BEFORE
THAT HAPPENED,

11:01.600 --> 11:03.898
I ALWAYS LIKED
TO MAKE STUFF FOR PEOPLE,

11:03.900 --> 11:05.322
LIKE PRESENTS
OR WHATEVER.

11:05.330 --> 11:07.218
AND THEN MY DAD DIED,
I COULDN'T--

11:07.230 --> 11:12.020
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT, I MEAN,

11:12.030 --> 11:13.827
EVEN NOW,
YOU KNOW ?

11:13.830 --> 11:16.094
BUT THEN I STARTED TO MAKE STUFF
THAT WAS SORT OF ABOUT THAT...

11:16.100 --> 11:20.355
AT FIRST, AND THEN STUFF THAT
WAS ABOUT OTHER THINGS TOO.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.794
I'M SORRY THAT
I'M RAMBLING RIGHT NOW.

11:22.800 --> 11:27.191
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THIS...

11:27.200 --> 11:31.455
WAY NOW OF,
LIKE, DEALING.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.321
AND IT'S
SO MUCH BETTER.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.726
I'M SORRY,
EXCUSE ME.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.826
EXCUSE ME, I'M SO SORRY,
THIS IS SO QUEER.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.991
IT'S FINE.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.651
I CONSTANTLY CRY AT
INAPPROPRIATE MOMENTS.

11:50.660 --> 11:53.094
YEAH, BUT I REALLY DON'T.

11:55.730 --> 11:57.550
HERE, SWEETIE.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.448
THANK YOU.

11:59.460 --> 12:04.227
( sobbing )

12:08.300 --> 12:09.619
THAN KS.

12:09.630 --> 12:12.519
( music on radio playing )

12:18.830 --> 12:21.594
WE'LL HAVE YOUR ASHES
ON SATURDAY.

12:27.030 --> 12:29.157
OH, UH, HE ACTUALLY ASKED
THAT I BE HERE FOR IT

12:29.160 --> 12:30.696
TO START THE MACHINE.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.758
CAN'T DO IT TODAY.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.227
A PACEMAKER EXPLODED
IN THE RETORT,

12:33.230 --> 12:34.458
SO THEY'RE
FIXING THE BURNERS.

12:34.460 --> 12:37.725
COME BACK TOMORROW AFTERNOON,
WE'LL TORCH HIM THEN.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.852
( door opening
and closing )

12:55.000 --> 12:56.797
HEY.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.358
IS TAYLOR
IN HER ROOM ?

12:58.360 --> 13:01.625
I GOT HER AN AIR PURIFIER
THAT'S ALSO A HUMIDIFIER.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.120
TAYLOR ?

13:14.400 --> 13:16.755
WHERE'S ALL
HER STUFF ?

13:16.760 --> 13:19.797
MY PARENTS CAME UP TODAY
TO TAKE HER DOWN TO SAN DIEGO.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.051
FOR HOW LONG ?

13:21.060 --> 13:22.425
FOR GOOD.

13:22.430 --> 13:23.749
WHY ?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.751
THERE'S NO WAY
WE COULD'VE KEPT HER.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.421
NOT AFTER WHAT I DID.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.059
WE COULD'VE TRIED.

13:34.660 --> 13:35.729
YOU COULD'VE
TOLD ME--

13:35.730 --> 13:37.220
I GOT SUSPENDED TODAY.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.448
OH, MY GOD,
UNTIL WHEN ?

13:39.460 --> 13:42.020
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE.

13:45.230 --> 13:46.390
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'LL FEEL--

13:46.400 --> 13:48.527
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I KNOW !

14:02.500 --> 14:04.422
AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S SUMMER.

14:04.430 --> 14:07.024
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP THERE WERE SEASONS,

14:07.030 --> 14:09.726
BUT IT STILL
GIVES ME THIS CHARGE.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.391
AND IT'S NOT
JUST THE NIPPLES.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.426
IT'S THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
IS OUT THERE

14:14.430 --> 14:17.228
FEELING SEXY
IN THEIR SKIN.

14:17.230 --> 14:20.996
I CAN'T SIT WITH A BEER
IN MY HAND

14:21.000 --> 14:23.252
AND WATCH THE ASS PARADE
ANYMORE.

14:23.260 --> 14:26.252
BECAUSE IT TAKES ME
OUT MY F-ING REALITY.

14:26.260 --> 14:29.229
IT'S A DRUG.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.949
THAT LITTLE
SHINE OF SWEAT.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.054
SOME CHICK IN TRAFFIC,

14:37.060 --> 14:40.757
I JUST WANT
TO JUMP IN THAT HER CAR

14:40.760 --> 14:43.297
AND LICK IT
RIGHT OFF HER.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.723
ON MY WIFE...

14:45.730 --> 14:48.358
IT MAKES ME SICK.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.352
I CAN SEE THE STAINS
UNDER HER ARMS,

14:51.360 --> 14:56.024
THE RED BUMPS WHERE SHE SHAVES,
ALL THE F-ING DETAILS.

14:57.900 --> 15:01.256
BUT THANKS TO MY HIGHER POWER
AND THIS PROGRAM,

15:01.260 --> 15:03.694
I HAVEN'T CROSSED
MY BOTTOM LINE IN THREE YEARS.

15:03.700 --> 15:08.194
AND FOR ME THAT MEANS
NO SEX OUTSIDE MY MARRIAGE.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.421
NO PROSTITUTES,
NO STRIP CLUBS,

15:12.430 --> 15:14.819
NO MASTU RBATION.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.852
I STOPPED DOING
ALL THE OTHER STUFF

15:20.860 --> 15:23.624
BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN HOW
TO BE INTIMATE WITH MY WIFE,

15:23.630 --> 15:25.996
AND I HAVE.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.958
I LOVE HER...

15:28.960 --> 15:32.726
I LOVE HER MORE
THAN ANYTHING.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.994
I JUST CAN'T
TOUCH HER.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.593
I COULDN'T EVEN KISS HER ANYMORE
THAN I COULD KISS MY OWN MOTHER.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.296
THE FACT IS, I HAVE
THIS F-ING DISEASE.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.097
AND THIS IS HOW
IT'S SHOWING UP TODAY.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.727
SO, THANKS.

15:49.730 --> 15:52.221
THREE YEARS, RIGHT ?

16:04.460 --> 16:06.291
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

16:06.300 --> 16:08.188
TO HAVE THEIR FACE
BURNED INTO YOUR FLESH.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.452
OR JUST
BE REALLY DRUNK.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.355
THE LOWEST
I COULD GET WAS 38.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.191
THOUSAND ?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.827
THE LOWEST ?

16:17.830 --> 16:19.650
THEY HAVE TO DIG UP THE WHOLE
FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE

16:19.660 --> 16:21.150
TO REPLACE
THOSE PIPES, DAVID.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.718
WE CAN TRY
ANOTHER CONTRACTOR.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.027
FUCK !

16:24.030 --> 16:26.658
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK.

16:26.660 --> 16:27.991
WHAT IS THIS ?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.889
RICO, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
SHUT DOWN THE HOME FOR A WHILE.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.026
WHAT ?!

16:34.030 --> 16:35.895
THIS FUCKING INSPECTION
JUST TOTALLY FUCKED US.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.027
BUT THEY CAN'T FINE YOU
FOR MORE THAN $2,500 AT A TIME.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.952
THE GUY GAVE US TWO WEEKS
TO REPLACE OUR DRAINAGE SYSTEM.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.552
WE JUST DON'T
HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.357
AND KROEHNER CAN'T EVEN
BUY US OUT ANYMORE.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.955
SO, WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN ?

16:49.730 --> 16:51.595
WE'RE HOPING YOU'LL CONSIDER
TAKING SOMETHING TEMPORARY

16:51.600 --> 16:53.750
SO THAT WHEN WE WORK THINGS OUT,
YOU COULD COME BACK.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.854
YOU MEAN,
IF YOU WORK THINGS OUT.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.851
WE KNOW
IT'S A LOT TO ASK.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.253
SCOTT ?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.023
YEAH.

17:09.030 --> 17:11.225
CAN DACE BOUVARD.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.295
I'M SO SORRY,
CAN DACE.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.256
I HAD SEX WITH LIKE,
200 WOMEN LAST YEAR

17:18.260 --> 17:21.423
AND ALL THE FACES
ARE A BLUR.

17:22.360 --> 17:24.726
WHY ARE YOU ONLY TAKING
50 MILLIGRAMS OF THE DILANTIN ?

17:24.730 --> 17:26.550
THAT'S WHAT
YOU PRESCRIBED.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.652
BUT YOU'RE STILL
HAVING SEIZURES.

17:27.660 --> 17:28.854
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO LET ME KNOW

17:28.860 --> 17:30.418
IF THAT HAPPENED SO I COULD
ADJUST THE DOSAGE.

17:30.430 --> 17:31.749
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME THAT.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.955
I'M SURE I DID.

17:37.630 --> 17:41.555
NOW THERE'S A BLEED,
THIS WAS SO UNNECESSARY.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.993
WHAT'S A BLEED ?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.059
THAT'S BLOOD.

17:46.100 --> 17:49.194
THE AVM RUPTURED, PROBABLY
DURING YOUR LAST SEIZURE.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.292
BUT WOULDN'T
I HAVE FELT THAT ?

17:50.300 --> 17:51.892
APPARENTLY NOT.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.856
IF I'D DONE THE EMBOLIZATION
I WANTED LAST SUMMER,

17:53.860 --> 17:55.452
WE WOULDN'T
BE IN THIS SITUATION.

17:55.460 --> 17:58.429
AVM IS VERY TREATABLE
IF YOU TREAT IT.

17:58.430 --> 17:59.419
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU DIDN'T--

17:59.430 --> 18:02.456
OKAY, I WANT
TO DO IT NOW.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.189
WELL, SO WOULD I,
IF I WERE YOU.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.519
BUT AT THIS POINT,

18:05.530 --> 18:07.418
MY ONLY OPTION IS
IMMEDIATE CRANIAL SURGERY.

18:07.430 --> 18:09.227
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

18:09.230 --> 18:13.223
IT MEANS IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS SUCKER IS BORDERING

18:13.230 --> 18:14.925
AN ELOQUENT AREA
IN THE BRAIN.

18:14.930 --> 18:16.227
YOU SAID IT WASN'T
LAST TIME.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.619
WELL, YOU MUST
HAVE MISHEARD ME.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.155
IT'S A LOT
OF INFORMATION.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.158
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

18:25.160 --> 18:26.889
I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.788
THERE'S A HIGH RISK
OF PARALYSIS,

18:28.800 --> 18:31.689
LOSS OF SPEECH,
VEGETATION OR DEATH.

18:31.700 --> 18:35.124
BUT I HAVE A VERY STRONG RECORD
WITH THIS KIND OF SURGERY.

18:35.130 --> 18:37.257
HOW MANY DEATHS ?

18:37.260 --> 18:38.989
NOT MANY.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.025
I CAN'T FIT THIS
IN TOMORROW,

18:41.030 --> 18:43.089
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE
TO COME IN SATURDAY FOR THIS.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.056
BUT I NEED YOUR BLOODWORK
DONE TODAY, ALRIGHT ?

18:45.060 --> 18:48.097
CONNIE'LL TELL YOU WHERE TO GO
FOR THAT WHEN YOU CHECK OUT.

18:52.630 --> 18:55.827
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA THAT I'M SICK.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.457
NOBODY DOES.

18:57.460 --> 18:58.757
YEAH, BUT COME ON.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.694
IT'S A LITTLE SELF-INDULGENT,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.827
WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE DYING
OF LEUKEMIA, OR WHATEVER,

19:02.830 --> 19:04.320
AND THESE GUYS
ARE LIKE,

19:04.330 --> 19:07.299
"IT'S NOT MY FAULT I BLEW
25 GUYS LAST NIGHT,
I HAVE A DISEASE."

19:07.300 --> 19:08.756
I MEAN, DEAL WITH IT.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.455
YEAH, WELL, WHEN I TRIED
TO DEAL WITH IT,

19:10.460 --> 19:13.293
I ENDED UP WITH
A SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT
FILED AGAINST ME

19:13.300 --> 19:15.359
BY HALF THE FEMALE ASSOCIATES
IN MY FIRM.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.520
FUCK.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.527
I'M REALLY GLAD WE DIDN'T,
YOU AND I,

19:22.530 --> 19:26.318
I WAS SPREADING GONORRHEA
ALL OVER L.A. LAST SUMMER.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.924
SO, WHEN DID YOU
ADMIT YOU WERE POWERLESS ?

19:38.930 --> 19:40.625
I HAVEN'T YET,
BY THE WAY.

19:40.630 --> 19:41.995
I CAN TELL.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.299
FIVE MONTHS, TWO WEEKS
AND THREE DAYS AGO.

19:45.300 --> 19:49.054
AND NOW YOUR LIFE IS JUST
ONE LONG HOT FUCK WITH GOD ?

19:49.060 --> 19:51.449
I'M AN ATHEIST,
ACTUALLY.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.098
YEAH ?

19:53.100 --> 19:56.957
AND WHO DO YOU TURN OVER
YOUR WILL AND YOUR LIFE TO ?

19:56.960 --> 20:00.191
I JUST PRAY
TO NOTHING.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.498
I SAY, "DEAR GOD,

20:02.500 --> 20:03.649
"WHO I DON'T BELIEVE IN,

20:03.660 --> 20:07.323
"HELP ME WITH
WHATEVER IT IS.

20:09.430 --> 20:11.648
"JUST STOP THINKING
ABOUT UNDRESSING

20:11.660 --> 20:14.322
"THIS INCREDIBLY
SEXY WOMAN

20:14.330 --> 20:17.652
WHO I'M TRYING TO HAVE
A REAL MOMENT WITH RIGHT NOW."

20:17.660 --> 20:19.628
OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

20:19.630 --> 20:22.155
DOES IT WORK ?

20:22.160 --> 20:24.822
UNFORTU NATELY,
YEAH, IT DOES.

20:28.630 --> 20:32.157
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO STOP
DRINKING OR SMOKING POT.

20:32.160 --> 20:36.290
ALL YOU CAN DO IS JUST TAKE IT
"ONE DAY AT A TIME."

20:36.300 --> 20:37.995
AND ALL THOSE
FUCKING SLOGANS,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.353
THEY MAKE ME WANT
TO TEAR OFF MY CLOTHES

20:39.360 --> 20:41.191
AND RUN SCREAMING
OUT OF THE ROOM.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.192
YOU KNOW,
I'M CURIOUS,

20:44.200 --> 20:46.896
HOW DOES HAVING
COMPULSIVE SEX WITH STRANGERS,

20:46.900 --> 20:50.051
NO CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY,

20:50.060 --> 20:52.893
A JOB THAT YOU HATE
AND A BROKEN ENGAGEMENT

20:52.900 --> 20:55.789
FEEL MANAGEABLE
TO YOU ?

20:55.800 --> 20:59.224
I DIDN'T SAY THAT MY LIFE
WASN'T UNMANAGEABLE,

20:59.230 --> 21:03.291
I JUST SAID THAT I HADN'T
ADMITTED THAT I WAS POWERLESS.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.124
I DON'T WANT TO HATE MY PARENTS
ANY MORE THAN I ALREADY DO.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.950
YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP
FORGIVING THEM.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.554
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT EITHER.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.954
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE PEOPLE

21:21.960 --> 21:23.848
THAT WALKS AROUND
IN PAIN ALL THE TIME.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.555
WHAT ABOUT
WHEN YOU ARE IN PAIN ?

21:25.560 --> 21:29.018
I CHOOSE NOT TO BE.

21:29.030 --> 21:31.089
WHAT'S SO BAD
ABOUT A LITTLE PAIN ?

21:31.100 --> 21:34.627
I FEEL LIKE
IT'LL KILL ME.

21:34.630 --> 21:37.258
IT WON'T.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.994
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GUY
BLEW UP IN THE RETORT.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.728
WE USUALLY CHECK
FOR THE PACEMAKER,

21:51.730 --> 21:53.425
BUT THIS GUY
WAS LIKE, 20.

21:53.430 --> 21:55.591
GO AHEAD.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.895
( machine whirring )

22:01.600 --> 22:03.249
AND BUILT.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.524
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WORKED OUT
FIVE HOURS A DAY.

22:05.530 --> 22:07.498
VANITY.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.128
THESE GUYS ARE OUT THERE
TAKING PILLS, GETTING IMPLANTS.

22:10.130 --> 22:12.348
MEN ARE THE NEW WOMEN.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.850
NO KIDDING.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.418
I HATE GYMS.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.227
ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON MACHINES
STARING AT THE TVs ?

22:17.230 --> 22:18.527
THEY LOOK LIKE
POD PEOPLE

22:18.530 --> 22:20.521
TRAINING TO LIVE
AMONG THE HUMANS.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.354
AW, SHIT !

22:25.360 --> 22:29.649
HANG ON,
I GOTTA REPOSITION HIM.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.457
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
THE CHEST

22:43.460 --> 22:45.792
IS RIGHT UNDER
THE MAIN BURNER.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.394
THAT'S WHERE MOST OF
YOUR MASS AND FLUIDS ARE,

22:48.400 --> 22:51.358
ALL THAT STUFF THAT
REALLY FUELS THE BURN.

23:04.260 --> 23:05.955
WE USED
TO LEAVE IT CHUNKY,

23:05.960 --> 23:07.996
SO PEOPLE WOULD KNOW
IT WAS REAL CREMAINS,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.696
NOT JUST WOOD CHIPS
LIKE THAT PLACE IN GEORGIA.

23:14.730 --> 23:18.723
BUT THEN WE DID THIS BABY
AND THE DAD SAW A LITTLE TOOTH

23:18.730 --> 23:21.756
AND HE FREAKED, LIKE,
"THIS ISN'T MY BABY !"

23:21.760 --> 23:24.092
WE HAD TO GET A DOCTOR
TO EXPLAIN TO HIM

23:24.100 --> 23:26.125
THAT THEY HAVE TEETH
EMBEDDED IN THEIR JAWS.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.598
MAN, HE WAS UPSET.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.718
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN A BABY GOES
IT'S A LOT OF DEAD HOPE.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.424
ARE YOU GOING
TO LISA'S ?

23:47.430 --> 23:49.728
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO GO SEE MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

23:49.730 --> 23:50.924
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.828
OH.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.196
DID YOU TALK TO HER ?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.954
( Nate )
YOU'VE GOT A KEY ?

23:56.960 --> 23:59.258
SOMETIMES I STAY WITH THE BABY
WHEN LISA HAS TO WORK.

23:59.260 --> 24:02.127
THEY SHOULD
BE HERE SOON.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.890
( door opening )

24:30.900 --> 24:32.128
( Lisa )
SEE ?

24:32.130 --> 24:35.827
I TOLD YOU GRANNY
WAS GONNA BE HERE !

24:35.830 --> 24:37.821
HI, GRANNY !

24:37.830 --> 24:39.650
HELLO,
SWEET PEA.

24:39.660 --> 24:41.855
CAROLE MADE ME COME WITH HER
TO THIS INTUITIVE NUTRITIONIST

24:41.860 --> 24:45.250
WHO TOLD HER SHE'S ALLERGIC TO,
LIKE, EVERYTHING.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.194
SHE SQUEEZED CAROLE'S
FINGERTIPS FOR 10 MINUTES

24:47.200 --> 24:49.725
AND I HAD TO SPEND TWO HOURS
LOOKING FOR BURDOCK ROOT.

24:51.030 --> 24:53.897
UH, I THINK EREWHON
HAS BURDOCK.

24:55.430 --> 24:57.193
THAN KS.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.022
I'M SORRY TO SHOW UP LIKE THIS,
AND I WON'T STAY LONG.

25:01.030 --> 25:04.158
I'M REALLY HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE.

25:11.430 --> 25:13.990
YOU KNOW
WHO THIS IS ?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.753
THIS IS YOUR DADDY.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.622
THIS IS WHERE YOU GOT
YOUR LITTLE MOUTH FROM.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.699
HI.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.498
WOW.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.094
HI, MAYA.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.797
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING MAYA
IS "ILLUSION" IN BUDDHISM,

25:38.800 --> 25:41.894
BUT IT'S ALSO
ANOTHER NAME FOR DURGA.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.549
THE MOTHER
IN SANSKRIT.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.051
AND IN GREEK IT'S
"MESSENGER OF THE GODS."

25:46.060 --> 25:48.358
AND MY MOTHER WAS HALF GREEK,
SO, YOU KNOW.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.557
OH, GOSH,
SHE'S SO SMALL.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.454
MOM, COME ON.

25:56.460 --> 25:58.325
YOU'LL THANK ME
WHEN YOU'RE OLD.

25:58.330 --> 25:59.820
( phone )

25:59.830 --> 26:01.195
I'LL GET IT.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.497
HELLO ?

26:02.500 --> 26:04.354
HI, BARBARA,
HOW ARE YOU ?

26:04.360 --> 26:05.793
OH, I'M FINE.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.199
DID YOU
GET THE TAPE ?

26:07.200 --> 26:11.694
SHE'S JUST AS PRECIOUS
AS PRECIOUS CAN BE.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.589
HOLD ON, LISA ?
IT'S BARB.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.158
TELL HER
I'LL CALL HER BACK.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.219
WHO'S BARB ?

26:18.230 --> 26:20.698
MY SISTER.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.452
CAROLE'S MOVIE ?

26:22.460 --> 26:26.089
NO, I JUST DON'T ENJOY FILMS
ABOUT RETARDED PEOPLE,

26:26.100 --> 26:27.852
BUT LISA WENT
TO THE PREMIERE.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.919
SHE SAID IT WAS GREAT.

26:29.930 --> 26:32.353
OH, YEAH.

26:32.360 --> 26:36.091
SORRY ABOUT MY MOM,
I GUESS SHE'S BEEN
A LITTLE LONELY.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.897
SHE'S A GODSEND.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.595
SHE'S BEEN
SUCH A HELP TO ME.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.397
SHE LOOKED WONDERFUL !

26:41.400 --> 26:44.358
WE ALTERED A PURPLE CHIFFON
CAFTAN I HAD IN THE CLOSET

26:44.360 --> 26:45.850
FROM THE 705.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.124
SHE'S JUST SO LOVING
AND FUN.

26:48.130 --> 26:51.497
I JUST HOPE I CAN BE
HALF AS GOOD A MOTHER AS SHE IS.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.092
I'M SURE YOU CAN.

26:53.100 --> 26:54.795
OKAY, BYE NOW.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.758
RUTH, IS THIS
THE BLANKET ?

26:57.760 --> 27:00.422
THAT'S THE ONE
I MADE FOR NATE.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.018
(crying )

27:07.600 --> 27:10.751
YOU KNOW, IN CERTAIN WAYS, LISA
REALLY REMINDS ME OF MYSELF.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.025
SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY
THE TWO OF YOU ARE TOGETHER

27:14.030 --> 27:16.590
REMINDS ME OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE
FOR ME WITH YOUR FATHER.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.124
MOM.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.791
I WAS RAISED WITH A VERY
SMALL TOWN MENTALITY

27:19.800 --> 27:21.620
AND GETTING MARRIED
WAS REALLY THE ONLY WAY

27:21.630 --> 27:23.052
YOU COULD
HAVE SEX AT ALL.

27:23.060 --> 27:26.052
SO, I NEVER TRIED TO FIND
THE PERFECT SOMEONE, YOU KNOW ?

27:26.060 --> 27:27.550
MOM.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.096
REALLY THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN
THERE ARE CHILDREN, YOU SEE ?

27:29.100 --> 27:31.728
IT BECOMES ITS OWN
VERY REAL KIND OF LOVE.

27:31.730 --> 27:33.220
MOM, I'M NOT
MARRYING LISA.

27:33.230 --> 27:34.549
DID I SAY YOU SHOULD ?

27:34.560 --> 27:38.291
I JUST THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
THE PROFOUND EFFECT A CHILD

27:38.300 --> 27:41.224
CAN HAVE ON YOUR LIFE.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.097
MOM, I THINK YOU SHOULD
FIND SOMEPLACE

27:44.100 --> 27:45.499
AND PULL OVER
FOR A MINUTE.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.694
WHY, ARE YOU ALRIGHT,
DEAR ?

27:46.700 --> 27:47.928
NO, I'M NOT.

27:51.630 --> 27:54.121
SATURDAY ?

27:54.130 --> 27:55.859
I KINDA NEED TO DO IT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.748
BUT...

27:57.760 --> 28:01.594
HAVE YOU TOLD DAVID ?

28:03.430 --> 28:04.920
YEAH.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.557
OH.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.620
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO TELL CLAIRE ?

28:12.300 --> 28:14.996
SHE KNOWS.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.390
SHE SAW ME HAVE A SEIZURE,
SO I HAD TO TELL HER.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.523
I'M SORRY, MOM.

28:34.730 --> 28:37.654
SO, I'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH NATE,

28:37.660 --> 28:39.821
AND DAVID WILL
TAKE ROBBIE'S VIDEO CAMERA

28:39.830 --> 28:42.390
TO CLAIRE'S GRADUATION
SO WE CAN ALL WATCH IT LATER.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.822
MOM--

28:43.830 --> 28:45.491
IT'S FINE,
I ALREADY ASKED HIM

28:45.500 --> 28:47.320
AND HE'S BRINGING IT OVER LATER
TO SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

28:47.330 --> 28:50.959
MOM, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO MY LAME-ASS GRADUATION

28:50.960 --> 28:52.723
WHEN NATE IS HAVING
MAJOR SURGERY.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.028
CLAIRE, NATE IS GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

28:55.030 --> 28:57.021
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR THIS PROCEDURE

28:57.030 --> 28:58.349
TO RUIN
YOUR SPECIAL DAY.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.918
BUT IT'S NOT
EVEN SPECIAL !

28:59.930 --> 29:01.329
I'M JUST
GOING FOR YOU !

29:01.330 --> 29:02.297
IT IS SPECIAL.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.699
IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.691
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GET
OVERSHADOWED BY YOUR BROTHERS,

29:05.700 --> 29:07.190
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.758
MOM, IF CLAIRE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT THIS,

29:08.760 --> 29:10.227
I'D LIKE TO BE
WITH NATE TOO.

29:10.230 --> 29:12.289
DAVID, GODDAMNIT,
I AM THE MOTHER HERE !

29:12.300 --> 29:14.427
AND I HAPPEN
TO BE A DAMN GOOD MOTHER,

29:14.430 --> 29:16.352
NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK FROM
YOUR LIMITED POINT OF VIEW.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.452
MOM--

29:17.460 --> 29:19.394
THIS IS WHAT
WE ARE DOING !

29:23.730 --> 29:25.925
NOW, WHO WANTS MILK ?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.849
SO, NOW YOU CAN GET THEM
TO MAKE YOU A PARTNER.

29:30.860 --> 29:33.090
IT'S FISHER AND SONS,
REMEMBER ?

29:33.100 --> 29:34.920
IT'S NOT
FISHER AND SONS AND DIAZ.

29:34.930 --> 29:37.148
THAT WAS BEFORE YOU HAD
$100,000 THEY NEED.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.425
I WANT TO LIKE PUT IT
IN A MUTUAL FUND, OR SOMETHING.

29:40.430 --> 29:43.627
SOME, OKAY, BUT NOTHING'S WORTH
AS MUCH AS BEING YOUR OWN BOSS.

29:43.630 --> 29:47.054
JULIO, CHECK THE BATH
ISN'T RUNNING OVER !

29:47.060 --> 29:49.358
I DON'T KNOW.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.499
THE BUSINESS ISN'T
EVEN GOING SO GREAT.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.890
SO, YOU GO IN THERE,
YOU MAKE IT GO GREAT.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.253
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

29:56.260 --> 29:59.559
JULIO,
TURN OFF THE BATH !

29:59.560 --> 30:01.494
I'LL DO IT.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.492
NO, HE NEEDS TO LEARN TO DO
SOMETHING WHEN I TELL HIM.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.559
YOU'RE GOING TO LET
THE HOUSE GET FLOODED

30:06.560 --> 30:09.199
SO YOU CAN
TEACH HIM SOMETHING ?

30:09.200 --> 30:11.122
( water shutting off)

30:11.130 --> 30:12.859
THANK YOU !

30:15.260 --> 30:18.525
I WANT TO BE CREMATED,
I DON'T WANT TO BE EMBALMED.

30:18.530 --> 30:20.851
NO VIEWING.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.123
THIS IS VERY
DIFFICULT FOR ME.

30:24.130 --> 30:27.258
YOU WANT ME TO
FILL IT OUT BY MYSELF ?

30:27.260 --> 30:28.750
YES.

30:28.760 --> 30:32.298
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DO THIS NOW.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.790
WE HAVE TO, ALRIGHT ?

30:33.800 --> 30:37.759
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH A FUNERAL.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.150
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO DIE.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.727
DAVID...

30:44.830 --> 30:47.253
I HAVE TO GET
READY FOR IT.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.990
AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD, TOO.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.355
WHAT ABOUT A SERVICE ?

30:58.360 --> 30:59.395
YEAH.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.425
I WANT ARI,

31:01.430 --> 31:04.456
THE RABBI WHO DID
JEFFREY SHAPIRO.

31:04.460 --> 31:07.725
A RABBI,
WHY NOT FATHER JACK ?

31:07.730 --> 31:10.358
IS FATHER JACK
DOING YOUR SERVICE ?

31:10.360 --> 31:13.124
NO, BUT THAT'S JUST
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

31:13.130 --> 31:14.859
TO GIVE HIM
THE WRONG IDEA.

31:14.860 --> 31:18.250
WHAT KIND OF IDEA IS HE
GOING TO GET WHEN YOU'RE DEAD ?

31:18.260 --> 31:19.796
I DON'T KNOW.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.995
I JUST DON'T WANT HIM
CRUISING ME IN THE AFTERLIFE.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.492
( laughing )

31:27.200 --> 31:29.760
OH, GOD,
I'M SORRY.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.398
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE AFTERLIFE IS ?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.755
SOME SEX CLUB
THAT NEVER CLOSES ?

31:33.760 --> 31:37.526
YEAH, AND NO ONE EVER TELLS YOU
IF IT'S HEAVEN OR HELL.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.719
FUCK, I'M REALLY SCARED.

31:43.730 --> 31:46.722
ME, TOO.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.620
I WISH YOU COULD
COME WITH ME.

31:50.630 --> 31:52.427
OKAY, I'M NOT GOING
TO CLAIRE'S GRADUATION.

31:52.430 --> 31:53.988
MOM IS INSANE.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.628
NO, GO TO THE GRADUATION,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.396
OH, GOD.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.322
( door closing )

32:19.930 --> 32:21.454
KEITH ?

32:35.430 --> 32:39.423
( sobbing )

32:47.060 --> 32:49.893
( door opening
and closing )

32:51.800 --> 32:54.519
HEY.

32:54.530 --> 32:55.758
HEY.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.421
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

32:57.430 --> 32:59.421
YEAH.

33:04.530 --> 33:05.895
WHERE WERE YOU ?

33:05.900 --> 33:09.154
JUST GETTING
SOMETHING TO EAT.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.759
OH, I WAS GOING
TO MAKE DINNER.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.955
YOU CAN STILL
MAKE DINNER.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.224
YOU MEAN
FOR MYSELF ?

33:17.230 --> 33:21.621
WHATEVER, I MIGHT BE
KINDA HUNGRY LATER.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.989
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO EAT THAT ?

33:27.000 --> 33:30.356
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A POACHED
CHILEAN SEA BASS AND POLENTA.

33:32.030 --> 33:35.124
WITH A WILD
MUSHROOM CASSOULET.

33:37.230 --> 33:38.788
(turning on tv)

33:46.960 --> 33:48.689
YOU COULD'VE
GOTTEN ME SOMETHING.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.452
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE HOME.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.989
DID YOU DO
ANYTHING TODAY ?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.956
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN ?

33:59.960 --> 34:02.349
DID YOU CALL
THAT GUY ?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.590
I DON'T NEED TO PAY
SOMEONE TO TELL ME

34:04.600 --> 34:06.124
I CAN GET A JOB
IN SECURITY.

34:06.130 --> 34:08.018
I'M SURE THERE ARE OPTIONS
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

34:08.030 --> 34:09.258
I KNOW A LOT
OF EX-COPS.

34:09.260 --> 34:11.228
THEY ALL WORK
IN SECURITY.

34:11.230 --> 34:12.629
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH SECURITY ?

34:12.630 --> 34:14.791
IT'S A NATIONAL OBSESSION,
IT'S THE NEW FREEDOM.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.654
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

34:16.660 --> 34:18.457
MY CAREER
ISN'T YOUR PROBLEM.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.198
( tv chattering )

34:41.730 --> 34:43.618
OH, I HAVE NEW PICTURES
OF MAYA !

34:43.630 --> 34:45.325
YES, I HAVE SEEN.

34:45.330 --> 34:46.297
THE NEW ONES ?

34:46.300 --> 34:48.518
I DON'T THINK SO.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.689
IS VERY CUTE,
I HAVE SEEN.

34:54.700 --> 34:56.520
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THESE,
THE SMILING ONES ?

34:56.530 --> 34:58.851
I JUST GOT
THESE YESTERDAY.

34:58.860 --> 35:02.728
RUTH, IS NOT MY GRANDBABY,
I DON'T NEED EVERY DAY TO SEE.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.194
I QUIT !

35:15.200 --> 35:16.895
CONSIDER THIS
MY TWO-WEEK NOTICE.

35:16.900 --> 35:19.619
BECAUSE I DON'T
LOOKING AT YOUR PHOTOS ?

35:19.630 --> 35:21.359
NO, I'M JUST NOT GROWING
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.555
AND I WANT TO BE AVAILABLE
TO HELP WATCH MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.993
OH.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.524
AND SINCE I NO LONGER
HAVE THE MONEY
TO HELP PAY FOR A SITTER,

35:26.530 --> 35:27.895
IT'S REALLY
THE LEAST I CAN DO.

35:27.900 --> 35:30.460
YOU TAKE OTHER JOB ?

35:30.460 --> 35:32.519
EVENTUALLY, I SUPPOSE
I'LL HAVE TO,

35:32.530 --> 35:33.849
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.590
OKAY, THEN, RUTH.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.659
IS ALSO
BETTER FOR ME.

35:38.660 --> 35:40.753
THIS WAY ONLY HAVE
TO PAY ROBBIE.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.218
WELL, YES, AND ALSO YOU SHOULD
KNOW YOU MAY BE LOSING

35:44.230 --> 35:45.652
FISHER AND SONS
AS A CLIENT.

35:45.660 --> 35:47.457
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE
TO CLOSE THE BUSINESS

35:47.460 --> 35:49.018
BECAUSE NO ONE
HAS THE MONEY WE NEED

35:49.030 --> 35:50.998
TO REPLACE
THE SEPTIC SYSTEM.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.797
AND THIS IS MY FAULT,
THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ?

35:52.800 --> 35:54.620
NO, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

35:54.630 --> 35:56.996
YOU MIGHT BE LOSING
THE ACCOUNT.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.052
I WILL PAY YOU
BACK THIS MONEY.

36:01.060 --> 36:02.618
I SAID IT WAS A GIFT.

36:02.630 --> 36:04.894
EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID
IT WAS GIFT, I WILL PAY BACK.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.151
WELL, THAT'S VERY SWEET.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.128
BUT I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.953
HERE, EVERY WEEK

36:13.960 --> 36:16.326
I PAY SOME PART OF IT.

36:16.330 --> 36:17.991
HERE, THIS IS
THE FIRST PAYMENT.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.895
$62.

36:22.900 --> 36:26.495
IS WAS A VERY
SLOW WEEK.

36:36.660 --> 36:40.118
HEARTLESS NOW,
HEARTLESS NOW

36:40.130 --> 36:43.657
( knocking )
IT'S HARD TO LOVE YOU
FOR THE MAN

36:43.660 --> 36:46.356
HOWEVER CAN
I HAVE MYSELF

36:46.360 --> 36:50.126
SUCH EVIL

36:51.330 --> 36:53.594
( lowering music )

36:53.600 --> 36:55.192
I DID KNOCK.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.690
I'M SORRY,
WAS THAT TOO LOUD ?

36:56.700 --> 36:57.997
NO.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.889
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D STOP BY AND SAY "HI".

37:00.900 --> 37:03.221
OKAY.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.850
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO THAT ART SCHOOL.

37:07.860 --> 37:10.294
I SO BLEW
THE INTERVIEW.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.349
THERE'S NO WAY.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.818
I TOTALLY
STARTED BAWLING.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.123
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHY ?

37:21.130 --> 37:25.123
I STARTED TALKING ABOUT DAD,
FOR SOME LIKE INSANE REASON,

37:25.130 --> 37:28.827
AND I JUST
FUCKING LOST IT.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.093
SO, IS THIS OPERATION,
LIKE REALLY SERIOUS ?

37:40.100 --> 37:43.649
NAH, I JUST GOTTA
GET RID OF THIS THING.

37:43.660 --> 37:47.118
IT'S SO NOT
A BIG DEAL.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.194
WELL, GOOD...

37:50.200 --> 37:51.895
BECAUSE...

37:54.800 --> 37:56.825
JUST GOOD.

37:59.900 --> 38:02.721
OKAY, THAT WAS BEFORE
YOU TALKED TO ME.

38:02.730 --> 38:04.197
FUCK.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.656
DID YOU TAKE THESE ?

38:05.660 --> 38:07.594
THESE ARE AMAZING.

38:10.300 --> 38:11.858
NO, THEY'RE OKAY.

38:11.860 --> 38:14.158
THIS GUY'S
A TOTAL FUCKING FREAK,

38:14.160 --> 38:16.890
BUT THE PICTURES
ARE AWESOME.

38:16.900 --> 38:19.698
THAN KS.

38:19.700 --> 38:23.158
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO YELL AT ME.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.990
I DIDN'T YELL, I WAS JUST
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.151
OKAY, DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY.

38:31.160 --> 38:36.097
AND I KNOW I HAVE A TENDENCY
TO FALL FOR KIND OF INSANE BOYS,

38:36.100 --> 38:41.197
BUT YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
TO DOLE OUT THE WISDOM

38:41.200 --> 38:43.555
LIKE YOU'RE THE DALAI LAMA
OR WHATEVER, AND

38:43.560 --> 38:48.327
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
SO INCREDIBLY TOGETHER

38:48.330 --> 38:49.888
THAT I'M JUST DYING
FOR YOUR ADVICE.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.788
WELL, I NEVER SAID I WAS
INCREDIBLY TOGETHER,

38:51.800 --> 38:53.153
I'M JUST A LOT OLDER.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.527
YEAH, AND I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THAT MUCH BETTER

38:56.530 --> 38:58.191
THAN I AM AT
THE RELATIONSHIP THING.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.497
LIKE, AT ALL.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.229
WELL, I DISAGREE.

39:01.230 --> 39:05.690
NO ONE I DATED EVER ATTACKED
ANYBODY WITH A KNIFE OR A GUN.

39:07.530 --> 39:08.952
OKAY.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.497
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN LIKE,

39:11.500 --> 39:13.320
YOU AND LISA OR BRENDA,

39:13.330 --> 39:15.958
OR ANY OF THE OTHER MILLION
MISSING GIRLFRIENDS, BUT--

39:15.960 --> 39:18.019
THERE HAVE NOT
BEEN A MILLION.

39:18.030 --> 39:22.148
I JUST GET THE SENSE THAT
YOU'RE NOT LIKE, FULLY DEALING.

39:30.330 --> 39:32.252
ALRIGHT.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.791
FINE, I'LL NEVER
GIVE YOU ADVICE AGAIN.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.427
NO, GIVE ME ADVICE, JUST...

39:37.430 --> 39:41.025
DON'T TRY AND ACT LIKE
YOU REALLY KNOW ANYTHING.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.658
WAIT, IS HE NUDE ?

39:47.660 --> 39:50.151
NO, GOD.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.856
50 THOUSAND.

39:52.860 --> 39:55.988
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
THIS BUSINESS IS WORTH ?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.422
NOT MUCH
WHEN IT'S SHUT DOWN.

39:57.430 --> 40:00.092
AND I WANT
TO BE EQUAL PARTNER.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.249
RICO, YOU--

40:01.260 --> 40:03.125
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

40:10.030 --> 40:12.021
I'M SORRY TO HAVE
TO SAY THIS NOW,

40:12.030 --> 40:14.692
BUT I THINK YOU MIGHT REALLY
WANT ANOTHER PARTNER, DAVID.

40:16.630 --> 40:19.690
NOT EQUAL, NO WAY.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.256
75 FOR 25%.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.148
DONE !

40:44.300 --> 40:46.359
ALRIGHT, OKAY.

40:48.430 --> 40:49.727
OKAY.

40:51.330 --> 40:54.595
OKAY, SO, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK

40:54.600 --> 40:55.851
A LOT OF WHAT
YOU HAD TO SAY--

40:55.860 --> 40:56.827
I'M SO SORRY--

40:56.830 --> 40:58.058
LET ME FINISH.

40:58.060 --> 41:01.325
A LOT OF WHAT
YOU SAID WAS TRUE.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.756
I DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOU.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.796
I'M THE ONE
THAT'S FUCKED UP.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.496
I'M SO FUCKED UP.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.388
OKAY.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.049
MAYBE.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.089
BUT...

41:19.100 --> 41:21.227
YOU WERE RIGHT
WHEN YOU SAID THAT

41:21.230 --> 41:24.893
BEING WITH YOU MADE IT EASIER
FOR ME TO FEEL SO TOGETHER.

41:24.900 --> 41:29.052
THAT I WAS READY
FOR SOMETHING REAL
AND YOU WEREN'T

41:29.060 --> 41:32.518
AND THAT IS
JUST NOT REALLY TRUE.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.291
NATE, I HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.121
I THINK I'M--

41:39.130 --> 41:42.588
GOD, I SO DON'T
WANT TO SAY THIS.

41:46.530 --> 41:47.724
HERE...

41:49.900 --> 41:53.154
I'VE BEEN GOING
TO THESE MEETINGS.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.727
I WENT TO ONE OF THESE MEETINGS
ONCE UP IN SEATTLE.

41:56.730 --> 41:57.924
IT FREAKED ME OUT.

41:57.930 --> 41:59.522
WHY ?

41:59.530 --> 42:01.327
JUST THE PEOPLE,
IT SEEMED LIKE A CULT.

42:01.330 --> 42:03.252
NO, WHAT MADE YOU GO ?

42:05.700 --> 42:08.123
I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT APPLY.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.397
WELL, IT SAYS
IN THE BOOK THAT

42:15.400 --> 42:17.322
ONCE YOU REALIZE
WHAT IT IS,

42:17.330 --> 42:20.356
AND YOU WORK REALLY HARD,
YOU CAN--

42:20.360 --> 42:23.750
PEOPLE HAVE THIS WHOLE
NEW EXPERIENCE OF LOVE.

42:25.330 --> 42:27.252
SOME PEOPLE, I MEAN.

42:30.530 --> 42:31.622
SO, WHAT ?

42:37.900 --> 42:40.357
I REALLY LOVE YOU.

42:40.360 --> 42:44.228
AND I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE
DONE WHAT I DID IF I DIDN'T

42:44.230 --> 42:47.427
REALLY LOVE YOU.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.825
THAT'S A VERY...

42:50.830 --> 42:54.197
STRANGE THING TO SAY.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.055
BUT I THINK IT'S TRUE.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.949
IT WAS THE FEAR OF

42:59.960 --> 43:02.952
FEELING SOMETHING...

43:02.960 --> 43:06.088
REAL.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.120
OKAY.

43:13.130 --> 43:15.758
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.652
I GUESS I JUST WANTED
YOU KNOW THAT

43:23.660 --> 43:25.093
EVEN THOUGH
YOU REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

43:28.860 --> 43:32.796
I MEAN, I STILL GET SO ANGRY
IF I LET MYSELF THINK ABOUT IT--

43:32.800 --> 43:34.449
OF COURSE YOU DO,
OF COURSE--

43:34.460 --> 43:36.257
BUT...

43:36.260 --> 43:39.354
I FELT LIKE
THIS WAS SOMETHING.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.794
BEING WITH YOU
MADE ME FEEL MORE...

43:41.800 --> 43:44.951
JUST FEEL MORE,
I GUESS,

43:44.960 --> 43:47.099
MORE THAN I USED TO FEEL.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.421
MORE THAN I FELT
WITH ANYONE.

43:49.430 --> 43:52.024
EVERYTHING I WAS
RUNNING AWAY FROM,

43:52.030 --> 43:53.395
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.823
FEAR, I GUESS.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.098
I FELT ALL OF
THAT WITH YOU.

44:01.860 --> 44:06.126
I'M GOOD AT MAKING
PEOPLE FEEL FEAR.

44:10.830 --> 44:11.819
BUT I CAN'T--

44:11.830 --> 44:13.593
NATE, I'M NOT
SAYING NOW--

44:13.600 --> 44:14.999
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.399
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.597
I'M HAVING
SURGERY TOMORROW.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.993
IT'S AN EM BOLIZATION.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.297
TOTALLY ROUTINE.

44:25.300 --> 44:28.554
CAN I BE WITH YOU ?

44:28.560 --> 44:30.448
NO.

44:34.100 --> 44:37.592
MY MOM'S COMING WITH ME,
AND IT'S REALLY NOTHING.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.124
I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

44:39.130 --> 44:40.654
OH, NATE.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.491
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
I GOTTA GO.

44:42.500 --> 44:44.456
NATE, PLEASE !

44:56.360 --> 44:58.692
( laugh track on tv)

45:01.360 --> 45:03.248
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

45:03.260 --> 45:05.319
IT REALLY COULD
BE GOOD FOR YOU GUYS

45:05.330 --> 45:08.424
TO HAVE A LATINO
POINT OF VIEW AT THE HOME.

45:08.430 --> 45:11.797
TOO BAD IT COMES IN THE FORM
OF A CONTROLLING HOMOPHOBE.

45:11.800 --> 45:15.395
WHEN WE MET, YOU WERE
A CONTROLLING HOMOPHOBE.

45:15.400 --> 45:19.052
AND APPARENTLY THAT WAS
VERY ATTRACTIVE TO YOU.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.821
WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO
CLAIRE'S GRADUATION TOMORROW ?

45:27.060 --> 45:28.994
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.422
WHY NOT ?

45:30.430 --> 45:33.024
IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD TIME FOR ME
TO BE DEALING WITH YOUR FAMILY.

45:33.030 --> 45:35.726
IT'S NOT MY FAMILY,
IT'S JUST ME AND CLAIRE.

45:35.730 --> 45:37.254
MY MOTHER IS GOING
TO BE WITH NATE.

45:37.260 --> 45:38.818
I REALLY CAN'T.

45:38.830 --> 45:40.593
WHY, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT MISS
"THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS ?"

45:40.600 --> 45:42.693
GOD, KEITH,
I ASK YOU FOR ONE THING.

45:44.300 --> 45:46.188
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE,
ROOMMATES ?

45:46.200 --> 45:47.724
IT'S LIKE
I DON'T EVEN EXIST.

45:47.730 --> 45:49.652
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

45:49.660 --> 45:51.525
I HAVE A LOT TO DEAL
WITH RIGHT NOW.

45:51.530 --> 45:52.690
NOT NOTICED ?

45:52.700 --> 45:54.588
IT DEFINES
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.090
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT
TAKING CARE OF YOU--

45:56.100 --> 45:57.692
FOR ONCE !

45:57.700 --> 45:58.655
WHICH YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE

45:58.660 --> 45:59.820
WHO ALWAYS NEEDS
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

45:59.830 --> 46:02.151
THAT IS SUCH BULLSHIT.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.355
WHO WERE YOU TAKING CARE OF
WHEN YOU SENT TAYLOR AWAY

46:04.360 --> 46:06.157
WITHOUT EVEN TELLING ME ?

46:06.160 --> 46:07.627
I MEAN, WHAT AM I,
THE DOG ?

46:07.630 --> 46:09.621
I MADE A DECISION, AND IT
WAS MY DECISION TO MAKE !

46:09.630 --> 46:11.325
YOUR DECISION,
WHY WAS IT YOUR DECISION ?

46:11.330 --> 46:12.524
IT'S MY FAMILY.

46:12.530 --> 46:14.088
I THOUGHT
I WAS YOUR FAMILY.

46:14.100 --> 46:15.829
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

46:17.060 --> 46:18.857
YET, DAVID,
YOU'RE NOT.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.748
YOU JUST MOVED IN HERE
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

46:20.760 --> 46:22.728
THERE'S THIS PRESSURE TO BE,
I DON'T KNOW,

46:22.730 --> 46:24.357
WHATEVER FAMILY UNIT FANTASY
YOU HAD IN YOUR HEAD

46:24.360 --> 46:26.191
WHEN YOU GOT ENGAGED
TO JENNIFER.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.428
I CARE ABOUT TAYLOR.

46:27.430 --> 46:29.398
I THINK SHE FEELS
AT LEAST AS CLOSE TO ME--

46:29.400 --> 46:31.095
THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.

46:31.100 --> 46:33.159
YOU ARE SUCH
AN ASSHOLE !

46:33.160 --> 46:35.697
I HAVE BEEN
TIPTOEING--

46:35.700 --> 46:36.621
"TIPTOEING" ?

46:36.630 --> 46:37.756
GET OFF ME.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.296
LYING ON THE COUCH
CRYING ABOUT THIS,

46:39.300 --> 46:40.892
AND THEN PRETENDING
EVERYTHING'S FINE ?

46:40.900 --> 46:43.698
I WAS CRYING ABOUT MY BROTHER,
YOU SELFISH FUCK !

46:44.430 --> 46:48.127
MY BROTHER COULD DIE TOMORROW,
DO YOU FUCKING EVEN THINK

46:48.130 --> 46:49.620
ABOUT HOW I MIGHT
BE FEELING ?

46:49.630 --> 46:51.097
NOT IF YOU
DON'T TELL ME !

46:51.100 --> 46:52.397
YOU COULD NOTICE !

46:52.400 --> 46:54.049
YOU COULD GIVE A FUCK,
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,

46:54.060 --> 46:55.721
ABOUT SOMEBODY
BESIDES YOURSELF.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.449
( grunting )

47:10.000 --> 47:11.854
OH, I'M REALLY
GONNA MISS HIGH SCHOOL.

47:11.860 --> 47:15.159
SO, WHY DOES MONTY PAPPAS
THINK GETTING INTO WILLIAMS

47:15.160 --> 47:17.993
HAS MADE HIM INTO SOMEONE
ANYONE WOULD EVER FUCK ?

47:18.000 --> 47:21.151
AS IF THE NAME OF THE COLLEGE
YOU GO TO MATTERS AT ALL.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.219
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
WILLIAMS IS, LIKE VIRGINIA ?

47:23.230 --> 47:24.697
VERMONT.

47:24.700 --> 47:26.918
IT HAS THAT SUMMER THEATER
PROGRAM WHERE MOVIE STARS

47:26.930 --> 47:29.592
GO TO HAVE SEX
AND DO CHEKHOV ?

47:29.600 --> 47:32.194
OH, MY GOD,
HOW'D YOUR INTERVIEW GO ?

47:32.200 --> 47:34.896
IT SEVERELY SUCKED.

47:36.530 --> 47:38.293
ARE YOU SUICIDAL ?

47:38.300 --> 47:41.428
NO, EAST VALLEY'LL
BE FINE.

47:41.430 --> 47:43.751
THEY'VE GOT A DARKROOM.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.853
THEY'VE GOT PAINT.

47:45.860 --> 47:48.021
AND EVERYONE SAYS
YOU GET OUT OF COLLEGE

47:48.030 --> 47:49.793
WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT ANYWAY,
SO, I'M JUST LIKE...

47:49.800 --> 47:53.156
WHATEVER.

47:55.100 --> 47:56.795
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
SO DELIRIOUS ABOUT IT,

47:56.800 --> 47:58.859
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M GOING THERE TOO.

47:58.860 --> 48:00.396
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

48:00.400 --> 48:03.255
YALE FOUND OUT
ABOUT MY SATs.

48:03.260 --> 48:05.751
THAT LITTLE INDIAN BITCH
TURNED HERSELF IN.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.899
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
ARE SCREWED

48:07.900 --> 48:10.391
JUST SO SHE WON'T
COME BACK AS A RODENT.

48:13.730 --> 48:16.927
OKAY, IT ISN'T
THAT FUNNY.

48:16.930 --> 48:18.795
CUNT.

48:19.660 --> 48:22.424
( groaning )

48:23.600 --> 48:27.149
( panting )

50:58.260 --> 50:59.625
YOU READY
TO GO, MOM ?

50:59.630 --> 51:01.257
OH, IS IT
TIME ALREADY ?

51:01.260 --> 51:02.488
JUST ABOUT.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.853
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN EATEN--

51:03.860 --> 51:05.122
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO.

51:05.130 --> 51:07.894
OH, OF COURSE,
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

51:07.900 --> 51:09.856
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

51:09.860 --> 51:12.055
WELL, CLEARLY THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME

51:12.060 --> 51:15.120
THAT MADE YOU KEEP SOMETHING
LIKE THIS FROM ME

51:15.130 --> 51:16.757
WHILE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER
KNEW FOR MONTHS.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.057
MOM, I'M SORRY.

51:18.060 --> 51:19.823
BUT WHY, WHY DOES
THIS KEEP HAPPENING ?

51:19.830 --> 51:21.821
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO WORRY YOU.

51:21.830 --> 51:23.798
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT ME !

51:23.800 --> 51:25.791
I'M SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT YOU !

51:25.800 --> 51:27.199
BUT YOU CAN'T.

51:27.200 --> 51:30.021
YOU CAN'T
PROTECT ME FROM THIS.

51:30.030 --> 51:32.624
I KNOW, BUT I CAN TRY,
THAT'S WHAT A MOTHER DOES.

51:32.630 --> 51:36.191
SHE TRIES TO PROTECT YOU
AND MOST OF THE TIME SHE FAILS.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.953
BUT IT'S THE TRYING
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LOVED.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.793
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEEL LOVED
IF YOU DON'T EVER LET ME TRY ?

51:41.800 --> 51:43.449
I DO.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.395
I DO FEEL LOVED.

51:47.400 --> 51:52.428
IT WAS JUST SO MANY MONTHS
I COULD HAVE LOVED YOU BETTER.

51:54.230 --> 51:55.595
YOU LOVED ME FINE.

51:58.700 --> 52:00.588
YOU'RE EVERYTHING.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.898
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

52:02.900 --> 52:05.755
YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.318
GOD, I DON'T
WANT TO GO !

52:07.330 --> 52:09.594
I WON'T G0,
I CAN'T.

52:09.600 --> 52:10.658
I CAN'T DO THIS,
I CAN'T.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.753
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.899
I WON'T LET YOU GO.

52:14.900 --> 52:16.856
I'LL NEVER
LET YOU GO.

52:31.530 --> 52:33.327
( David )
ALMOST READY ?

52:33.330 --> 52:35.252
MM-HMM.

52:35.260 --> 52:37.854
WE CAUGHT UP WITH LA's
HOTTEST HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE

52:37.860 --> 52:40.590
IN A QUIET
MOMENT AT HOME.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.057
SO, CLAIRE,

52:43.060 --> 52:45.722
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE LEAVING
YOUR CHILDHOOD BEHIND ?

52:45.730 --> 52:48.290
ALRIGHT, YOU CAN
REALLY STOP THAT NOW.

52:48.300 --> 52:50.655
FOR MANY YOUNG PEOPLE,
GRADUATION BRINGS UP FEELINGS

52:50.660 --> 52:52.696
OF ANXIETY
AND PISSINESS.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.156
NO, REALLY.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.697
CUT.

52:59.230 --> 53:01.528
ARE YOU SMOKING POT ?

53:01.530 --> 53:03.327
YOU WANT SOME ?

53:03.330 --> 53:05.093
YEAH.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.889
GOD, THESE DUSTBALLS
ARE LIKE TUMBLEWEEDS.

53:11.900 --> 53:14.551
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
ANYONE SWEPT UNDER HERE ?

53:14.560 --> 53:16.096
I DON'T KNOW.

53:16.100 --> 53:18.227
WHEN DID MOM START
WORKING FOR NIKOLAI ?

53:18.230 --> 53:22.451
( Russian accent)
YOUR MOTHER IS
A VERY GOOD WOMAN.

53:22.460 --> 53:26.089
GOD HAVE MERCY,
GOD HAVE MERCY.

53:26.100 --> 53:29.228
( together )
GOD HAVE MERCY.

53:33.330 --> 53:36.219
HOW PSYCHED ARE WE THAT WE'LL
NEVER HAVE TO CALL HIM DADDY ?

53:36.230 --> 53:37.788
THANK GOD
SHE SNAPPED OUT OF IT.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.598
I THINK HE'S THE ONE
WHO PULLED THE PLUG, ACTUALLY.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.158
REALLY ?

53:42.160 --> 53:44.549
WHAT A PIG.

53:44.560 --> 53:46.221
HE THINKS HE CAN
DO BETTER THAN MOM ?

53:46.230 --> 53:48.755
I'M GUESSING
SHE WAS A LITTLE CLINGY.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.659
DID NATE EVER TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED WITH BRENDA ?

53:52.660 --> 53:56.027
NO, HE WAS STRANGELY
NONVERBAL ABOUT IT.

53:56.030 --> 53:58.624
HE'S USUALLY SO EAGER
TO REGALE US WITH THE DETAILS

53:58.630 --> 54:00.154
OF HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.549
NOT ALWAYS.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.425
I GUESS NOT.

54:10.460 --> 54:13.588
SO, WHEN DID THEY GO ?

54:13.600 --> 54:15.955
REALLY EARLY.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.791
I GUESS IT'S LIKE
A TWO-PART THING ?

54:17.800 --> 54:19.995
YEAH, FIRST THEY TRY TO STOP
THE BLEEDING WITH THIS GLUE.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.525
THEY PUT A CATHETER
IN THROUGH HIS GROIN

54:22.530 --> 54:23.622
AND THREAD IT
ALL THE WAY UP--

54:23.630 --> 54:24.995
IT'S OKAY.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.956
I DON'T
NEED THE DETAILS.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.689
SORRY.

54:28.700 --> 54:30.998
ANYWAY, THAT PART
MUST'VE HAPPENED ALREADY.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.821
THE CRANIAL SURGERY
IS A FEW HOURS LATER.

54:33.830 --> 54:36.253
SO, LIKE, NOW ?

54:36.260 --> 54:39.491
SOON, I GUESS.

54:44.230 --> 54:47.597
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING
TO THIS STUPID GRADUATION.

54:47.600 --> 54:50.091
I KNOW, FUCK IT.

54:50.100 --> 54:51.055
SERIOUSLY.

54:51.060 --> 54:52.721
YOU'RE DRIVING THOUGH.

54:52.730 --> 54:54.459
FINE.

55:11.900 --> 55:13.322
( car ignition starting )

55:44.030 --> 55:47.295
( tv chattering )

56:31.360 --> 56:33.999
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FEEL
A SLIGHT STING, OKAY ?

56:37.060 --> 56:39.392
COUNT BACK FROM 10,
PLEASE.

56:41.760 --> 56:43.625
10,

56:43.630 --> 56:45.598
NINE,

56:45.600 --> 56:47.295
EIGHT,

56:47.300 --> 56:48.995
SEVEN,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.195
SIX...
