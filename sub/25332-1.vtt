00:25.373 --> 00:27.394
Here, you want to hit this?

00:27.418 --> 00:28.917
- There's nothing left.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.571
- There's still a little.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.137
Here.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.879
You didn't bring any more?

00:33.903 --> 00:35.489
- You said you were bringing it.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.193
- I didn't bring any.
You were supposed to.

00:37.217 --> 00:39.325
Dude, who goes to a haunted
house without weed, man?

00:39.349 --> 00:41.582
Hold on, let me just
hit this real quick.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.758
- Get in there and
get outta there.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.958
- Alright, give me
your flashlight, man.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.155
Dude, this place
is super creepy.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.114
- More like super dumb.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.377
- Dude, watch your step, man.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.943
Look, look.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.728
Disgusting toilet.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.556
Oh, spiders.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.166
Look at it.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.689
- This place sucks, dude.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.387
- Oh man.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.910
- This is embarrassing.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.651
- This is an old house, though.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.131
Look, look.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.741
"No exit."

01:09.765 --> 01:11.786
- Way to be original.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.223
- What does that mean?

01:13.247 --> 01:14.639
- Some hack shit.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.468
- Look at all this stuff.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.186
It's super old.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.890
- This place is not even scary.

01:21.914 --> 01:23.755
Fuck it.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.520
- Yo, check out this
room back here, man.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.673
Oh, check it.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.718
Look, get the "666."

01:30.742 --> 01:32.938
- Mmm numbers, great.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.877
There's a pentagram
on the ground, too.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.640
"Death to all."

01:47.672 --> 01:50.999
♪ I don't take no drugs... ♪

02:10.173 --> 02:12.282
- Isn't this your dad's car?

02:12.306 --> 02:15.589
He doesn't care if you
hotbox the whole thing?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.833
- "Hotbox."
- What?

02:20.749 --> 02:22.794
- Can't believe we're
actually graduating.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.339
- I can't believe YOU'RE
actually graduating.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.036
- Seriously, right?

02:28.060 --> 02:30.140
With all the crazy stuff
we've been through together.

02:30.164 --> 02:31.953
- You were the first
person I saw in braces.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.346
- It was a grill.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.871
- I remember wanting
them so bad.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.004
- I remember being jealous
of your perfect smile.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.706
- Now we have one last summer
'til real life starts.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.143
- Real life?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.796
You got into a
division one school

02:48.820 --> 02:50.711
on an academic scholarship.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.540
I'll be working my
ass off on the pole,

02:53.564 --> 02:55.523
trying to put my way
through college.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.850
- I need to do
something exciting.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.113
One last crazy adventure...

03:01.137 --> 03:03.420
Something we'll
remember forever.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.364
- Yeah well, the boys'
idea of something exciting

03:05.388 --> 03:07.424
is sitting around smoking pot.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.904
- If I wanted to do that, I could
just stay in my dad's car.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.803
- Who's that?

03:16.848 --> 03:17.849
- Drew.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.265
- Ooh, your little boyfriend?

03:22.289 --> 03:23.788
- Not even, okay?

03:23.812 --> 03:25.398
Don't start with that.

03:25.422 --> 03:26.965
We're just friends.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.185
- You're more than
"just friends."

03:29.209 --> 03:31.665
- Yeah, he's one of
my best friends.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.624
- Best friends who
sleep together?

03:33.648 --> 03:35.582
- Ew! We were six.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.149
It was a nap.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.846
- Friends who embrace?

03:38.870 --> 03:41.066
- Yeah, I hug him
when I say hello.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.874
I hug everyone. I'm a hugger.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.355
- What'd he say?

03:47.009 --> 03:49.272
- Asking, "Where we at?"

03:51.013 --> 03:52.928
- Hold the blunt.
Gimme your phone.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.409
- Becca! What the f...

03:58.977 --> 04:00.738
What did you write?

04:00.762 --> 04:01.956
- Nothing.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.808
- Becca, what did you write?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.800
- Who's that, the bitches?

04:19.824 --> 04:22.238
- Yes, Truggers,
it's "the bitches."

04:22.262 --> 04:24.022
- And what did they say?

04:24.046 --> 04:25.134
- Nothing.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.331
- She just wants me...
- Okay.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.465
Bro, you're so lame.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.609
- What are you writing? Just
give me my phone, please.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.164
- Dude, you'll be
thanking me later

04:36.188 --> 04:38.384
when you're finally
banging this girl.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.528
- Okay, I'm never gonna be
thanking you, first of all,

04:40.552 --> 04:42.040
and we're never
gonna be banging.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.650
She doesn't like me like that.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.503
- Ooh... friend zone.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.029
Gimme that.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.773
- This isn't even clever.
It's just stupid.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.606
- Lucky, it's pretty
brilliant, no?

05:04.434 --> 05:06.891
- It's brilliant.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.546
- Yeah, it's so brilliant that
they're for sure not coming now.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.764
Like you're an idiot.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.288
- Trust me bro,
tonight's the night.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.637
- Did you get the beers?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.552
- Bro, I got wine coolers.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.945
- Wine coolers? Are those
even still a thing?

05:17.969 --> 05:19.512
- Dude, shut up, man.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.035
It's the only thing
my step dad had.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.385
Don't ask any questions.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.344
- Wine coolers?

05:25.368 --> 05:27.694
- Yo, okay guys, you know
who likes wine coolers?

05:27.718 --> 05:29.174
- Your step dad?

05:29.198 --> 05:31.394
- Chicks do. Chicks
like wine coolers.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.570
- Chicks and your step dad.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.920
- Dude, shut up, man. Chicks
love wine coolers, man.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.487
It's makes them horny.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.315
Look it up in the Bible.
It's right there.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.794
If we stick to this plan,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.405
this night could be so good.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.581
Lucky can even get
lucky for once.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.278
- I've had sex before.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.801
- Oh, he means that time

05:47.825 --> 05:49.542
on the cruise in Jamaica
with his family.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.066
I remember...
- I thought it was in Mexico.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.201
- I don't care if you
guys don't believe me.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.508
I've had more sex than
both of you guys combined.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.142
I know, like, every
single position.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.208
- Mhm... Bro, are
you texting them?

06:03.232 --> 06:04.912
Come on, don't say
anything stupid, please.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.957
- Give me my phone back.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.567
Becca, no...

06:14.591 --> 06:16.898
- Stop. Just shut up.
It's just a joke.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.403
- Great.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.666
Now he thinks I want
to sleep with him.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.539
- Well, you do.
- I don't know what I want.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.845
But you pretending to be me

06:31.869 --> 06:33.891
and relaying the fact that I...

06:33.915 --> 06:38.417
"am ready to feel
all of it, big boy"

06:38.441 --> 06:40.245
is not helping my situation.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.618
- I think it is.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.738
Great, my phone died.
Hope he got my text.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.331
First death of the night.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.269
- Come on, dude, pick a card.
I'm gonna totally guess it.

07:03.293 --> 07:04.693
Come on, man. This
trick is amazing.

07:04.717 --> 07:05.847
- Guys...

07:07.557 --> 07:09.317
They'll be here in five minutes.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.430
- Yeah.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.104
- Game face, boys.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.758
This is the night!
This is the night!

07:14.782 --> 07:17.132
Stick to my plan. Here we go.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.179
Truggers better bring
his A game tonight.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.023
Seriously, though, we gotta be
quiet going to the man cave.

07:25.047 --> 07:27.248
- "Man cave?" It's a shed.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.773
- He calls it a man cave.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.339
It's actually kind of cute.

07:31.363 --> 07:34.517
- Yeah... adorable.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.302
- We gotta make sure we don't
wake up his crazy step dad.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.024
- Okay, hopefully this isn't
gonna be awkward now.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.960
- It's just Drew and
Truggers, right?

07:42.984 --> 07:44.115
- And Lucky.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.138
- Lucky?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.922
Gross.

07:48.946 --> 07:52.210
Oh God, there! Yes! Yes!

07:53.560 --> 07:56.060
Oh yeah!

07:56.084 --> 07:59.193
Oh God, yes!

08:15.843 --> 08:18.299
- Wow, Truggers can't
wait five minutes.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.693
You really have
him whipped, huh?

08:20.717 --> 08:22.956
- It's Zoe.
- What?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.828
No, Becca! I told you
not to invite her.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.569
- Come on, just
give her a break.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.832
She's really not the slut
everyone thinks she is.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.576
So what if she slept
with a football player?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.183
- She slept with the whole team.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.184
- The whole team?
- Yeah, even Lorne Weinberg.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.794
- Coach Lorne?

08:35.818 --> 08:38.232
- Ew, no! His gross
son, the mascot.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.582
- That was just a hand job.
And so what?

08:40.607 --> 08:42.696
At least she isn't
afraid to live a little.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.284
Fine, I won't invite her.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.981
- Thank you.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.505
You know you're the
bestest most best

08:49.529 --> 08:51.269
understanding BFF
in the whole world.

08:55.752 --> 08:56.752
- Shh!

09:00.235 --> 09:01.255
- Ow!

09:26.522 --> 09:29.960
♪

09:40.101 --> 09:42.582

09:43.670 --> 09:45.541
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.065
- Hey, babe.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.438

09:53.462 --> 09:55.353
So cute!

09:55.377 --> 09:56.876
- Eh, she's a hugger.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.486
- Well, get a few
of these in you

09:58.510 --> 10:00.401
and you can graduate to kissing.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.585
- Why don't you two just focus
on your disgusting habit

10:02.609 --> 10:04.489
of each other and leave
the normal people alone.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.087
- Honestly dude, again?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.762
- What?

10:12.786 --> 10:14.938
- You're humping my
shit again, Lucky.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.548
- No I'm not!
- Dude, you totally are!

10:16.572 --> 10:18.332
- Are you watching porn?!

10:18.356 --> 10:19.793
- No way.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.990
- Wow!

10:24.014 --> 10:26.384
Well, technically,
it's not porn.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.517
- See?

10:29.541 --> 10:32.390
You guys are so cruel,
so quick to judge.

10:32.414 --> 10:35.480
- We're just judging that
not-so-massive boner

10:35.504 --> 10:37.221
in your pants there, brah.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.289
- Ha ha.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.775
- Here, let's get you
out of the way...

10:46.994 --> 10:48.580
Hey, have you guys
seen this video?

10:48.604 --> 10:50.451
- Nah, which one?

10:50.475 --> 10:51.825
- Check this out.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.108
- Come on!

10:55.132 --> 10:57.012
- Go, go, hit him! Get him.
Get him!

10:57.036 --> 10:58.068
- Come on!

10:58.092 --> 10:59.852
- Fight him! Just go!

10:59.876 --> 11:01.956
- Oh my gosh, you guys
are supposed to...

11:01.980 --> 11:02.980
- Ooh!

11:06.230 --> 11:08.190
- Dude, did you see the one
where the guy gets hit

11:08.214 --> 11:09.557
in the nuts with a baseball bat?

11:09.581 --> 11:11.124
Amazing.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.952
- Wait, what's the title?

11:12.976 --> 11:14.737
- It's right there, man.
Come on.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.347
- Recording?

11:16.371 --> 11:18.218
- A dare's a dare bro.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.786
A dare's a dare bro.
Are you ready?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.483
A dare's a dare, bro.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.787
Home run swing! A dare's a dare!

11:25.685 --> 11:28.141
- Oh!

11:28.165 --> 11:29.534
- That was amazing.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.536
- Have you guys seen
"Three girls, one pale?"

11:31.560 --> 11:33.059
- Throw it on. Let's go.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.974
- Is this all we
have going tonight?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.846
'Cause we're gonna get
real bored real quick

11:36.870 --> 11:38.935
if you plan on keeping us
in this smoke dungeon.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.525
- What's that video?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.137
- Whoa.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.203
"Real haunted house?"

11:46.227 --> 11:47.900
Sick.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.511
- Dude, this place
is super creepy.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.731
- More like super dumb.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.733
- Dude, watch your step, man.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.953
Look, look.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.172
Disgusting toilet.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.434
- Holy shit, hold on.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.018
I know that voice. Hit
the pause button.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.827
- It's an old house, though.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.529
- Yeah, that's Howard.
Oh my god.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.270
- Who's Howard?

12:10.294 --> 12:11.881
- Howard Greenfeld.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.505
His mom used to go to
school with my mom.

12:13.529 --> 12:15.362
This is crazy.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.016
- Why is it crazy?

12:17.040 --> 12:18.868
- 'Cause Howard's dead.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.587
- Dude...
- How?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.676
- That's the thing,
nobody knows.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.981
Last thing I heard is that he
went to some abandoned house

12:27.005 --> 12:28.680
or some shit and there
was an accident.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.421
- Spirits.
- Huh?

12:30.445 --> 12:33.056
- Howard Greenfeld...
Thermer High?

12:35.145 --> 12:37.820
He went to that Kirby Road house
and no one ever saw him again.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.149
He died.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.826
- From what, a slip
and fall accident?

12:43.850 --> 12:45.566
- Have you never
heard of Kirby Road?

12:45.590 --> 12:47.264
- Lucky, jump on it, bro.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.179
- Yup, I'm already two
steps ahead of you.

12:49.203 --> 12:53.294
Okay the headline says,
"Kirby Road haunted house."

12:54.904 --> 12:56.490
Okay, that's good enough.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.101
Confirmation for me.
Case closed.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.474
- Give me this man, come on.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.498
Okay, back in '71,

13:04.522 --> 13:07.545
the Wisefeld family owned
the house on Kirby Road.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.416
Mrs. Wisefeld, who
was in her 30's,

13:09.440 --> 13:12.202
was said to be having an
affair with a younger man.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.770
Husband comes home around 9 PM

13:14.794 --> 13:16.510
to find his wife having sex

13:16.534 --> 13:19.470
while their two children
were playing downstairs.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.559
The sight of seeing his
wife with another man

13:21.583 --> 13:23.213
filled him with so much rage

13:23.237 --> 13:25.998
they say his eyes
turned fiery red.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.458
And then...

13:28.764 --> 13:30.394
- And then?

13:30.418 --> 13:33.049
- And then he goes up
to the master bedroom,

13:33.073 --> 13:34.790
boom, kills the cheating wife,

13:34.814 --> 13:36.400
boom, kills the lover,

13:36.424 --> 13:38.706
boom, boom kills both the kids,

13:38.730 --> 13:40.404
goes up to the bathroom,

13:40.428 --> 13:42.362
can't stand the sight of
himself in the mirror,

13:42.386 --> 13:44.214
so he hangs himself.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.803
- Boom.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.023
- Apparently the house has been
for sale for more than 40 years.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.851
Nobody wants it.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.071
- Oh, sounds like a fixer.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.377
- Sounds like that's what
we're doin' tonight.

13:57.401 --> 14:00.119
- Come on. It's just
an urban legend.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.860
- So is Lucky's heterosexuality.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.383
We're not questioning
that, are we?

14:03.407 --> 14:04.689
- Fuck it, I'll go.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.995
- Eh?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.779
- Well, I'm out.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.650
- Yeah, it sounds stupid.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.783
- Wait, wait, wait... Hold on.

14:11.807 --> 14:15.221
It says here that kids are still
known to visit the house today.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.789
The police have said that
there's been unexplained deaths

14:17.813 --> 14:19.791
in the past but they
refuse to comment on them.

14:19.815 --> 14:20.860
- Howard.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.216
- It says here that if you
visit the house today,

14:24.240 --> 14:26.560
you can still see a reflection
of the man hanging to death.

14:26.584 --> 14:28.121
- You mean like...

14:29.129 --> 14:30.976
like a ghost?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.935
- Can it be any reflection?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.850
- Yes to both.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.243
Apparently you can see him
on any reflective surface...

14:37.267 --> 14:39.637
A mirror, a window...

14:39.661 --> 14:41.117
- Like his glasses?

14:41.141 --> 14:42.969
- Wow, you are such an idiot.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.470
- There's more, hold on.
There's more.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.951
Says here the eyes are
the window to your soul,

14:48.975 --> 14:50.953
and that if you make eye
contact with the spirit,

14:50.977 --> 14:53.085
it can enter you
through the eyes,

14:53.109 --> 14:54.695
taking possession of you.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.349
- That doesn't even make sense.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.525
- Says here it turns
your eyes fiery red

14:58.549 --> 14:59.986
and there's only one
way to stop it.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.423
- How?

15:04.381 --> 15:06.620
- By removing your eyeballs...

15:06.644 --> 15:08.448
by any means necessary.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.885
- That's disgusting!

15:09.909 --> 15:12.713
- What if you manage
to avoid eye contact?

15:12.737 --> 15:15.238
- You know, that is a
really great question.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.414
- Says here that if you
manage to avoid eye contact,

15:17.438 --> 15:18.981
you can avoid the evil spirit,

15:19.005 --> 15:21.766
but if you do see the
ghost of the hanging man,

15:21.790 --> 15:24.010
eye contact or not,
no matter what...

15:26.099 --> 15:27.293
- What?

15:27.317 --> 15:28.753
- Yeah, what?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.061
- You're dead.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.482
I'm just kidding.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.226
It's all just an urban
legend anyway, right?

15:44.250 --> 15:46.008
- You dick.
- Atta boy.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.250
- Come on, now.

15:48.469 --> 15:51.013
- So, what, Howard
goes into this house

15:51.037 --> 15:53.319
and he never gets out?

15:53.343 --> 15:54.736
He dies in there?

15:56.868 --> 15:59.978
- Well, to be honest with
you, no one actually knows.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.371
- Whoa.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.571
Unsolved murder mystery.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.095
- Press play on the video.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.999
- Yo, check out this
room back here, dude.

16:10.023 --> 16:12.077
Dude, look. Get the "666."

16:12.101 --> 16:14.166
- Mmmm, numbers.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.497
- There's a pentagram
on the ground, too.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.241
"Death to all."

16:35.081 --> 16:36.623
- Yo, bitches!

16:36.647 --> 16:38.843
- Aw, man.
- What the hell, Becca?

16:38.867 --> 16:41.585
- I couldn't say no
to my favorite slut.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.240
- Waddup, Zoe?
- What's up, bae?

16:44.264 --> 16:46.344
- Damn, girl!
- Wine cooler, babe?

16:46.368 --> 16:47.678
- Naw.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.573
- Damn, Jordan, you
even gonna say hi?

16:50.922 --> 16:52.489
- Hey, Zoe. How are you?

16:54.100 --> 16:55.468
- Like you care.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.948
Drew, waddup, homie?

16:56.972 --> 16:58.321
- Waddup, Zoe?

16:59.583 --> 17:00.778
- Lucky.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.606
- Hey, Zoe.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.173
Word up.

17:04.196 --> 17:06.175
- Aw, you kinda cute
with that Jew-fro!

17:06.199 --> 17:08.481
I should braid it for you.

17:08.505 --> 17:11.421
Would you like that... Lucky?

17:14.119 --> 17:16.098
So what's the deal? Gimme that.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.362
- You wouldn't know what
to do with it anyway.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.798
Just like Drew and Jordan.

17:20.821 --> 17:23.060
- Okay, come on man.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.324
- Why do you have to be
such a negative asshole?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.413
- Chicks dig an asshole, babe.

17:27.436 --> 17:28.997
- She is right about
you being negative,

17:29.021 --> 17:30.460
and I can prove it.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.833
- I'll show you negative.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.551
- Relax, tough guy.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.707
Leave him alone. Play
with me instead.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.209
- Did you guys know

17:40.233 --> 17:41.862
that negative and
positive energy

17:41.886 --> 17:43.386
is actually for real,

17:43.410 --> 17:45.605
and that it can be measured?

17:45.629 --> 17:47.955
Mhm. I even have an app.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.132
- Look at this guy with
his fancy app phone.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.699
- Apps are the future, man.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.267
They're developing
apps for everything.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.791
- Apps... That'll never work.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.141
- Watch.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.405
All you do is press "energize,"

18:02.429 --> 18:05.277
and then you point it in
the direction of the thing

18:05.301 --> 18:07.540
that you want to measure...

18:16.443 --> 18:18.619
- Truggers, stay still.
- No.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.081
Get away from me.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.785
- I'm gonna shove that
negative energy up your ass.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.875
- I mean really, guys, is
this what were doing tonight?

18:37.899 --> 18:40.138
This is supposed
to be the start to

18:40.162 --> 18:42.121
the most amazing
summer of our lives.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.452
- You guys suck.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.758
- You guys want to go to
Cable Guy Jeff's Jam?

18:51.782 --> 18:54.065
DJ Haruka's gonna be spinning.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.589
Or maybe we can turn this into

18:56.613 --> 18:59.375
a pajama jammi-jam, huh?

18:59.399 --> 19:01.203
- Um, actually,

19:01.227 --> 19:04.143
we were thinking about
going to this house on...

19:05.318 --> 19:07.774
Kirby Road.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.365
- Lucky!
- Really?

19:10.497 --> 19:11.691
- You know it?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.128
- Do I know it?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.521
My ex-fiance's brother
went there one night.

19:15.545 --> 19:16.894
- You have an ex-finance?

19:18.635 --> 19:20.874
- You got a warrant? Huh? No?

19:20.898 --> 19:22.615
You stay outta my
business, little man.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.511
- So what happened?

19:26.426 --> 19:28.404
- This guy's an idiot.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.508
This clown went in there on
some cartoon dog mystery,

19:30.532 --> 19:32.538
tryin' like crack
the case and shit.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.237
Telling people let's split up,
you go here and I go there.

19:35.261 --> 19:38.481
Honest to god truth, I
heard the guy almost died.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.001
Plus there was that other
dude that died there, too.

19:42.659 --> 19:43.659
- Howard.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.771
- White boy, kinda big?

19:47.795 --> 19:49.425
Yeah, that's him.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.602
So, you guys are tryin'
to get deep tonight, huh?

19:52.626 --> 19:53.951
- Mhmm.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.815
- To be honest with you,
we don't actually know

19:55.839 --> 19:56.884
what we want to do yet.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.137
- Fine, I'll go.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.879
- Whooo! Ahhh! Let's
rock n' roll!

20:08.903 --> 20:10.359
Whooo!

20:10.383 --> 20:11.664
- Yes!

20:11.688 --> 20:13.488

here guys, come on.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.660
Alright, guys, pile in the SUV.

We're riding in style tonight.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.403
Yeah, that' what
I'm talking about.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.796
- SUV?
- It's a mini-van.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.321
Step dad's.
- It's the same thing.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.043
- No, actually, it's
completely different.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.457
- Get in fuckin' SUV, you
midget motherfucker!

21:44.694 --> 21:47.369
Alright, guys if you need
anything, now's the time.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.656
We're going to make a
quick pit stop, alright?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.331
Condoms.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.139
- Condoms?

22:14.768 --> 22:17.529
- Hey, can you get me one of
those suck pop candy things?

22:17.553 --> 22:18.772
Please?

22:21.862 --> 22:24.319
- Suck pop candy
ring thing, bro?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.973
- Alright boys, bring it in.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.324
I got this shit.

actually it might be better...

22:34.918 --> 22:37.181
- Now and forever.
- Sorry.

- These idiots think they're
all about to get some ass.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.927
- Not a chance.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.344
- Truggers, this plan is weak.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.694
- Dude, what are you talking...
This is a sure thing.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.000
We get 'em in the place,
we get 'em scared.

22:54.024 --> 22:56.089
We protect them,
then we get laid.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.656
It's a simple algorithm.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.354
- What are we gonna
do to protect us?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.138
- Dude just go get some condoms.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.792
- Yeah, for you?

23:02.816 --> 23:04.359
- No, for you, you rookie.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.882
I actually enjoy the
feeling of sex,

23:05.906 --> 23:07.626

Fun-face isn't gonna

23:07.650 --> 23:09.062

hyperbaric chamber

gonna eat you alive.

condom packet by the corner,

the condom with your teeth,

Place the rolled condom on
the tip of the hard penis

tip of the condom,

main at the church.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.913
Could you get some eyes on it?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.764
- Ten-four. I'm on it.

32:23.854 --> 32:26.050
You and your friends thought
it'd be a good idea

32:26.074 --> 32:29.010
to do a little what, ghost-
hunting here on Kirby Road?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.099
- Ghost hunting? That's
pathetic, officer.

32:31.123 --> 32:34.015
- Agreed.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.060
So today's your lucky day.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.347

you or your friends

32:53.101 --> 32:56.037

32:56.061 --> 32:58.802

Told you I had it handled.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.103
- It didn't look like you
had it handled, dude.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.007

34:05.260 --> 34:07.108

34:07.132 --> 34:08.891

34:08.916 --> 34:11.025

34:11.049 --> 34:12.938
he showed me a
picture of his kids,

34:12.963 --> 34:14.940
I told him I was looking
for a haunted house.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.074
- You told him that?

34:17.098 --> 34:19.206

34:19.231 --> 34:22.906

off the street by 9 AM.

- Ew.

44:08.602 --> 44:11.083
- Okay. So now what?

44:12.345 --> 44:14.192
- Now we need somebody
to touch the object,

44:14.216 --> 44:15.846
and then we can begin.

44:15.870 --> 44:17.369
- I'm not touching that.

44:17.393 --> 44:18.873
- Nobody's touchin' that.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.400

44:58.783 --> 45:00.761
you must speak the language
of the other world.

You guys are like a
human embarrassment.

47:59.615 --> 48:01.463
I don't know how you

48:01.487 --> 48:03.619
You guys are fucking so gnarly.

balling BS, huh?

Stick to the plan, rookie.

are you talking about?

three girls into this creepy

own selfish pleasure.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.314
Just open your eyes.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.193
Lucky!

01:06:21.325 --> 01:06:22.369
You're okay!

01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:24.957
- I'm fine!

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.133
I'm fine!

01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:32.051
I'm not gonna die a virgin.

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.791
- You scared the shit out of me!

01:06:33.815 --> 01:06:37.186
- Well, those guys put that dumb

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:39.232
urban legend into our heads,

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.190
so what am I supposed to think?

01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:42.844
And here I am,

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:45.064
thinking that I'm gonna
get my eyes scooped out

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:46.888
and that I'm never gonna
be able to see again.

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:49.788
- You're alright?

01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:51.920
- Yeah.

01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:54.812
Everything's cool.

01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:56.336
I'm fine,

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.275
you're fine...

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:33.310
- Whoa.

01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:44.669
- Lucky!

01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:52.155
Lucky...

01:07:53.634 --> 01:07:54.983
Lucky, what's happening?!

01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:10.714
- Jordan! Jordan,
what's happening?

01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:12.020
- Lucky!

01:08:12.044 --> 01:08:13.935
- Jordan, help!

01:08:13.959 --> 01:08:15.395
Jordan!

01:08:29.714 --> 01:08:31.497
- Get off of me,
you crazy bitch!

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:57.785
Becca...

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:01.267
Becca, did you do this?

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:12.124
- I don't want to die!
- Lucky!

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.366
- What's happening?!

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:21.872
Jordan, what's happening to me?

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:24.091
- I don't know what to do!
What should I do?

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:25.658
Just try not to move.

01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:28.227
- It's not like I have
a fucking choice!

01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:34.363
Jordan!

01:09:37.346 --> 01:09:38.845
Jordan!

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:49.272
- Lucky!

01:09:52.884 --> 01:09:54.688
Drew!

01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:56.366
Truggers!

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.434
Zoe!

01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:24.698
Thank god! I thought you left.

01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:28.136
Zoe?

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:24.323
Drew, wake up!

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:30.305
- Jordan...

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:31.698
- Are you okay?

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:33.177
- I think my ankle's broken.

01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:34.918
- Fuck! Your ear!

01:11:34.942 --> 01:11:36.596
- Hey listen, are you alright?

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.295
- Lucky's dead.

01:11:41.384 --> 01:11:43.560
Zoe's dead...

01:11:53.526 --> 01:11:55.441
- Truggers is dead.

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.883
Becca's...

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:06.036
she's gone.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.517
- Look, we have to
get out of here.

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.127
- Listen, listen...

01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:11.911
Lucky has a phone. He
has a phone downstairs.

01:12:11.935 --> 01:12:14.095
We have to get to that phone.
We have to call the cops.

01:12:14.119 --> 01:12:16.992
We need to get you up.

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.580
- You're going to be okay, okay?

01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:30.409
Just stay with me and hang on.
We're gonna get out of here.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:31.651
- Jordan...

01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:34.524
I love you.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.745
- I...

01:12:40.791 --> 01:12:42.270
I love you, too.

01:13:48.249 --> 01:13:49.729
Die, you bitch!

01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:57.452
Drew! Drew!

01:13:57.476 --> 01:13:59.391
Drew, wake up!

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.295
Drew, you're going to be okay.

01:14:14.319 --> 01:14:15.973
I'm gonna get us help, okay?

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:39.475
Okay, if I was Lucky's
password, what would I be?

01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:54.074
Drew...

01:15:02.106 --> 01:15:04.325
Drew, you need to be okay!

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.702
Drew... Drew!

01:15:13.726 --> 01:15:15.162
Please!

01:15:35.922 --> 01:15:38.272
Help!

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.972
Help me!

01:17:03.488 --> 01:17:04.881
Damn it!

01:20:47.407 --> 01:20:48.844
I'm sorry.

01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:44.073
♪

01:22:57.494 --> 01:22:59.298
- What the hell
happened in there?

01:22:59.322 --> 01:23:01.039
I told you not to
go in that house.

01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:07.939
Miss, are you okay?

01:23:09.506 --> 01:23:10.942
