<i>{blows whistle}</i>

00:54.855 --> 00:56.391
<i>I told you
they would be here.</i>

00:56.490 --> 00:58.026
<i>All right.
What's your secret?</i>

00:58.091 --> 00:59.593
<i>How did you know this time?</i>

00:59.693 --> 01:02.333
<i>Dad, I'm not really
getting anything.</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:03.602
<i>He's good.</i>

01:03.697 --> 01:05.677
<i>Checking his watch.</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:07.370
<i>Our Senator's a busy man.</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:11.079
<i>They're walking in.</i>

01:11.171 --> 01:13.014

<i>They're going
into the north penthouse.</i>

01:42.903 --> 01:44.905
<i>You got to go down in 2206.</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:50.281
<i>Would you like your room
turned down? Hello?</i>

01:50.377 --> 01:52.220
<i>What accent is that?</i>

01:52.279 --> 01:54.418
<i>I don't know, like a Scottish
mixed with Salma Hayek.</i>

01:54.481 --> 01:57.291
<i>We need to workshop
that a little more.</i>

01:58.418 --> 01:59.158
<i>The room is clear.</i>

02:01.989 --> 02:03.798
<i>Vertigo moment.</i>

02:03.890 --> 02:05.597
<i>{Sam}
What do you mean?
What are you doing?</i>

02:05.659 --> 02:07.138
<i>Molly, what's going on?
I can't see.</i>

02:07.227 --> 02:08.399
<i>What's happening out there?</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:10.305
<i>Please be careful.</i>

02:10.396 --> 02:11.899
<i>I have a will.</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:14.002
<i>I need to leave
my nothing to someone.</i>

02:14.101 --> 02:16.638
<i>I will not plunge to my death.</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:20.744
<i>Do not plunge to your death.</i>

02:20.807 --> 02:22.286
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

02:22.342 --> 02:23.685
<i>Be very careful, please?</i>

<i>{screams}</i>

02:58.178 --> 02:59.316

02:59.379 --> 03:00.619
<i>What does that mean?</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:02.490
<i>It was
a manage a gross.</i>

03:02.549 --> 03:04.392
<i>Just get out of there.
it doesn't matter.</i>

03:04.484 --> 03:05.792
<i>{Man}
Get back here!</i>

03:08.055 --> 03:10.001
<i>I'm in the northeast stairwell.</i>

03:10.057 --> 03:11.502
<i>I'm on the roof.</i>

03:11.558 --> 03:12.798
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

03:12.859 --> 03:13.894
<i>How do I get out of here?</i>

03:15.462 --> 03:16.964
<i>Shit.</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:18.737
<i>I don't like it
when you swear.</i>

<i>Well, well, darling.</i>

<i>Molly? Where are you?</i>

03:28.041 --> 03:29.520
<i>Molly?</i>

03:29.576 --> 03:30.919
<i>You get the pictures
you need?</i>

03:31.011 --> 03:32.752
<i>I'm not the one cheating.</i>

03:32.846 --> 03:34.883
<i>No, you're the one taking
the dirty pictures of it.</i>

03:34.981 --> 03:37.552
<i>You're the lowest of the low,
you know that?</i>

03:37.651 --> 03:39.153
<i>You're beneath the paparazzi.</i>

03:39.219 --> 03:40.721
<i>That hurts.</i>

03:40.821 --> 03:42.198
<i>Then just give me the camera.</i>

03:42.255 --> 03:45.862
<i>I said give me the camera!</i>

03:45.926 --> 03:47.234
<i>Okay!</i>

03:48.895 --> 03:51.205
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

03:51.264 --> 03:52.743
<i>That a girl.</i>

03:55.035 --> 03:56.776
<i>Now give it to me.</i>

03:57.671 --> 03:59.048
<i>Catch!</i>

03:59.106 --> 03:59.607
<i>No!</i>

04:02.109 --> 04:04.680
<i>I am not the paparazzi!</i>

05:37.671 --> 05:39.947
<i>{camera shutter}</i>

05:48.515 --> 05:51.553
<i>Excuse me? Can I talk
to you for a second?</i>

05:51.651 --> 05:54.996
<i>I'm not really
the sugar daddy type
and I'm kind of busy here.</i>

05:59.626 --> 06:01.196
<i>I understand.</i>

06:03.230 --> 06:05.403
<i>Excuse me? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

06:05.498 --> 06:08.308
<i>This woman
has been following you
and taking your picture.</i>

06:08.368 --> 06:10.746
<i>I know she doesn't
look it, but she's
a private investigator</i>

06:10.837 --> 06:12.407
<i>that's been hired
by your wife</i>

06:12.505 --> 06:13.916
<i>to prove you're
cheating on the road.</i>

06:14.007 --> 06:15.486
<i>She doesn't have
any evidence,</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:17.249
<i>so if you pop down
to the next stop</i>

06:17.344 --> 06:19.221
<i>I'm sure you could find
a waitress that you could</i>

06:19.312 --> 06:20.985
<i>that you could talk your way
into her pants.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:25.321
<i>Looks like
you just freed up.</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:27.865
<i>Armon Ranford, FBI.</i>

06:27.921 --> 06:30.492
<i>Have you heard
of the Georgian Mafia?</i>

06:30.557 --> 06:32.264
<i>A group of these monsters</i>

06:32.359 --> 06:34.270
<i>immigrated into the United
States 15 years ago,</i>

06:34.361 --> 06:36.841
<i>led by a guy
named Vor Kashalov.</i>

06:36.897 --> 06:39.207
<i>He deals with drugs,
fraud and extortion.</i>

06:39.266 --> 06:41.268
<i>And what's this
have to do with me?</i>

06:41.368 --> 06:43.939
<i>We're levelling an indictment
against Kashalov this afternoon.</i>

06:44.037 --> 06:46.108
<i>His chief witness
is a guy named Jason Patrone.</i>

06:46.206 --> 06:48.846
<i>Patrone did the books
for Kashalov
without knowing it.</i>

06:48.909 --> 06:51.913
<i>And we are in the process
of convincing Jason Patrone</i>

06:52.012 --> 06:54.014
<i>to testify against Vor.</i>

06:54.080 --> 06:56.026
<i>And I got a grilled
cheese for lunch.</i>

06:57.384 --> 06:59.386
<i>- What?
- What is your point?</i>

06:59.452 --> 07:02.695
<i>My point is Patrone's daughter
goes to college in New Orleans,</i>

07:02.756 --> 07:04.702
<i>and we want you
to keep an eye on her.</i>

07:04.758 --> 07:06.897
<i>Don't you have someone
at the bureau
that can do that?</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:08.940
<i>Our trainees would have
a pretty difficult time</i>

07:09.029 --> 07:11.270
<i>passing as a college
sorority girl.</i>

07:11.364 --> 07:13.310
<i>They're pretty beefy
and they got moustaches.</i>

07:13.400 --> 07:15.471
<i>And that's just the women.</i>

07:15.568 --> 07:18.048
<i>I did my homework on you.
Your mother died
when you were young.</i>

07:18.104 --> 07:19.913
<i>You were raised by your father,
and by proxy,</i>

07:19.973 --> 07:21.714
<i>most of the Dallas
police force.</i>

07:21.775 --> 07:23.584
<i>At eleven, you became
a really great shot,</i>

07:23.643 --> 07:25.748
<i>and you're well versed
in Jiu Jitsu.</i>

07:25.812 --> 07:27.382
<i>I'm an Aikido man myself.</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:28.551
<i>Sorry.</i>

07:28.615 --> 07:30.288
<i>Why are you sorry?</i>

07:30.383 --> 07:32.158
<i>Aikido is a fashionable way
for fat housewives</i>

07:32.252 --> 07:33.890
<i>to lose weight
at their local Equinox.</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:36.230
<i>Are you calling me
a fat housewife?
Yeah.</i>

07:36.289 --> 07:38.098
<i>You don't think
that Jiu Jitsu
is a dated form?</i>

07:38.158 --> 07:40.104
<i>No. It's the most
effective defence system</i>

07:40.160 --> 07:41.571
<i>when it comes
to overcoming size.</i>

07:41.628 --> 07:43.266
<i>Please!
I'm serious.</i>

07:43.330 --> 07:45.173
<i>With the right amount
at leverage and speed,</i>

07:45.265 --> 07:46.903
<i>I'd drive you
through that window.</i>

07:46.967 --> 07:48.810
<i>If you were behind
the wheel of a forklift.</i>

07:48.902 --> 07:50.438
<i>This is a waste of my time.</i>

07:54.975 --> 07:56.818
<i>You know what a heart hit is?</i>

07:56.910 --> 07:58.583
<i>Never heard of it.</i>

07:58.645 --> 08:00.625
<i>It's an Eastern European
enforcement practice.</i>

08:00.680 --> 08:02.353
<i>The family
will plant someone</i>

08:02.449 --> 08:04.360
<i>into the life
of a loved one
of their enemy.</i>

08:04.451 --> 08:06.692
<i>The plant will work their way
into the life of the target.</i>

08:06.786 --> 08:08.527
<i>Get close to them.</i>

08:08.621 --> 08:11.101
<i>So the threat
of a hit alone
prevents testimony.</i>

08:11.157 --> 08:12.761
<i>Exactly. There is
a heart hit planted</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:15.136
<i>on Jason's daughter's life.</i>

08:15.195 --> 08:17.106
<i>Her name is Alex Patrone.</i>

08:17.163 --> 08:19.109
<i>We think she's holding
something for her father.</i>

08:19.165 --> 08:21.304
<i>Some evidence
against Kashalov.</i>

08:21.368 --> 08:25.111
<i>Financial statements,
accounting ledgers
that provide her dad</i>

08:25.171 --> 08:27.344
<i>with a bargaining chip
of some sort.</i>

08:27.440 --> 08:29.943
<i>I can't do it.
I'm needed here.</i>

08:30.010 --> 08:31.717
<i>Fifteen thousand.</i>

08:31.811 --> 08:32.812
<i>I've got a kid.</i>

08:32.879 --> 08:34.517
<i>No, you don't.</i>

08:34.614 --> 08:36.287
<i>Your dad
got kicked
off the police force</i>

08:36.349 --> 08:37.293
<i>who loves to gamble.</i>

08:37.350 --> 08:39.023
<i>Same thing.</i>

08:39.119 --> 08:41.030
<i>I'm offering you a chance
to do something real.</i>

08:41.121 --> 08:43.158
<i>A chance to work
for the FBI.</i>

08:43.222 --> 08:46.397
<i>A chance to possibly make
a real difference
in someone's life.</i>

08:46.493 --> 08:48.302
<i>Think about it, Molly,</i>

08:48.361 --> 08:50.671
<i>because we both know
that chasing cheating truckers</i>

08:50.730 --> 08:53.472
<i>is not the top rung
of investigative fulfilment.</i>

08:55.001 --> 08:57.345
<i>My card.</i>

08:57.404 --> 08:59.179
<i>In case you change your mind.</i>

08:59.239 --> 09:00.479
<i>Not going to.</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:54.804
<i>Where were you?</i>

09:54.894 --> 09:57.306
<i>Oh, I had dinner
with the guys.</i>

09:57.397 --> 09:59.775
<i>That coffee cup you're holding
is from Rolly Roasters,</i>

09:59.866 --> 10:02.574
<i>and there's
only two franchises
in the Dallas area.</i>

10:02.635 --> 10:06.447
<i>At the airport
and Lone Star Park.</i>

10:06.539 --> 10:08.712
<i>You always
read the newspaper
at dinner with the guys,</i>

10:08.775 --> 10:11.119
<i>yet that newspaper
you're holding
hasn't been opened yet.</i>

10:11.211 --> 10:13.088
<i>And that red stamp
on your hand
gives you access</i>

10:13.146 --> 10:15.319
<i>to the box seat section.</i>

10:16.416 --> 10:18.157
<i>So tell me, Dad,</i>

10:20.220 --> 10:21.995
<i>how was the track?</i>

10:23.923 --> 10:26.164
<i>You're too quick
for me, Moll.</i>

10:26.259 --> 10:28.068
<i>How much?</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:33.441
<i>I was so close to getting
that money for that lawyer.</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:36.606
<i>I was so close
to getting back
on the force and then...</i>

10:36.669 --> 10:39.741
<i>Really! I was just
one hot streak away.</i>

10:40.573 --> 10:41.574
<i>Dad.</i>

10:41.641 --> 10:43.746
<i>And then I lost.</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:45.084
<i>Then I chased.</i>

10:45.145 --> 10:46.351
<i>How much?</i>

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
<i>Seventeen thousand.</i>

11:08.468 --> 11:09.879
<i>Armon.</i>

11:12.338 --> 11:14.682
<i>What is this place?
You'll see.</i>

11:16.342 --> 11:18.151
<i>We've gained you entry
to Alex's sorority.</i>

11:18.211 --> 11:20.623
<i>You're a transfer
from University of Hawaii.</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:23.786
<i>Obscure school.
Far away. Smart.</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:27.127
<i>But I need more money.
What?</i>

11:27.187 --> 11:29.793
<i>Listen, I'm going to take the gig.
I'm going to go to the college.</i>

11:29.856 --> 11:31.199
<i>I'll even throw in
some lipstick.</i>

11:31.291 --> 11:33.362
<i>But I need five grand more.</i>

11:33.459 --> 11:36.133
<i>Fine, but you're going to do
a lot more than just
put on lipstick.</i>

11:46.873 --> 11:49.649
<i>Okay, you're like,
40 minutes late!</i>

11:49.709 --> 11:51.154
<i>Who's this?</i>

11:51.211 --> 11:53.157
<i>I'm Bizzy.</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:54.556
<i>You're busy?</i>

11:54.647 --> 11:56.149
<i>No, Molly,
her name is Bizzy.</i>

11:56.216 --> 11:57.854
<i>She works out
of the New York office.</i>

11:57.917 --> 12:01.262
<i>So what's this look
we're rocking? Hobo chic?</i>

12:01.354 --> 12:03.095
<i>I don't get it.</i>

12:03.189 --> 12:06.329
<i>Okay, you have to like try on
all these clothes.</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:07.996
<i>Fine.</i>

12:08.061 --> 12:10.541
<i>No, Molly, you say
"totally" or you say</i>

12:10.597 --> 12:13.771
<i>its shorter cousin "totes"
when you want to say "fine."</i>

12:15.501 --> 12:19.278
<i>Okay then, let's go.</i>

12:19.372 --> 12:20.874
<i>Accessories.</i>

12:20.940 --> 12:23.511

<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
That was totes inappropes.</i>

12:55.108 --> 12:57.088
<i>No, I liked it.</i>

13:10.290 --> 13:12.395
<i>She is ruthless
and power hungry</i>

<i>and runs the house
with an iron fist-ish.</i>

13:15.061 --> 13:16.904
<i>She's like Khadafi

13:16.963 --> 13:20.069
<i>In-styler rolling hot iron.
Trust me. You'll need it.</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:24.479

Not really.</i>

13:27.607 --> 13:29.746

<i>In an earthquake?</i>

<i>Cotton, Taylor, Hunter.</i>

<i>They were conceived
while their parents</i>

13:39.952 --> 13:42.193
<i>were having sex
in an L.L. Bean outlet store.</i>

13:42.288 --> 13:44.632
<i>This is your target
right here. Alex Patrone.</i>

13:44.691 --> 13:47.262
<i>You are her best friend.
Got it.</i>

13:47.327 --> 13:52.436
<i>Bravo wicked thin
lubricated condoms,
size large, jumbo pack.</i>

13:52.498 --> 13:54.535
<i>Yeah, I won't
be needing those.</i>

13:54.634 --> 13:58.810
<i>Oh! It's like a sad animal
attempted suicide on her head.</i>

13:58.871 --> 14:00.782
<i>You both know
I'm sitting right here.</i>

14:00.840 --> 14:04.720
<i>If anyone can do it, you can.
You're the hair whisperer.</i>

<i>This is your phone.</i>

14:06.979 --> 14:08.822
<i>What did you do?
Rob a nine-year-old?</i>

14:08.881 --> 14:10.724
<i>No, you're actually going
to use this phone.</i>

14:10.817 --> 14:12.524
<i>It's got
a built-in Kappa app</i>

14:12.618 --> 14:14.655
<i>with information on all
of your sorority sisters.</i>

14:14.721 --> 14:16.064
<i>Kappa app?
That's right.</i>

14:16.155 --> 14:17.691
<i>And this one
you will not use.</i>

14:17.790 --> 14:20.999
<i>But keep it on you
and on at all times.</i>

14:21.060 --> 14:22.664
<i>Why?</i>

14:22.729 --> 14:24.402
<i>Because that's how
I'm going to find you.</i>

14:24.497 --> 14:26.170
<i>You'll receive a text.</i>

14:26.232 --> 14:28.007
<i>What if I need to call you?
You'll get a text.</i>

14:28.067 --> 14:29.910
<i>So if I need to call you,
I'm going to get a text?</i>

14:30.002 --> 14:31.208
<i>Correct.
Makes no sense.</i>

14:31.304 --> 14:32.749
<i>Kappa phone,
bat phone.</i>

14:32.839 --> 14:35.319
<i>Don't call it a bat phone.
Why not?</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:38.322
<i>It belittles the importance
of the phone.</i>

14:38.378 --> 14:40.517
<i>Okay. I'm sorry,
but I'm calling it
a bat phone.</i>

14:40.580 --> 14:44.653
<i>No. The bat phone was red,
and it was a land line,</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:46.424
<i>and Bruce Wayne
used it for calls,</i>

14:46.519 --> 14:49.659
<i>and you're only using that
to receive texts!</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:53.169
<i>I don't see the point, okay?
Okay.</i>

14:54.594 --> 14:56.938
<i>And this right here</i>

14:58.731 --> 15:01.712
<i>is your brand new
Volkswagen EOS.</i>

15:01.768 --> 15:04.112
<i>Come on, can't I ride
my bike to school?</i>

15:04.203 --> 15:05.944
<i>Girls your age
would jump up and down</i>

15:06.038 --> 15:07.517
<i>for a chance
to drive this thing.</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:08.881
<i>I'm not like
most girls.</i>

15:08.941 --> 15:10.352
<i>Brook Stonebridge is.</i>

15:10.410 --> 15:11.753
<i>Who's Brook Stonebridge?</i>

15:11.844 --> 15:13.551
<i>It's your new identity.</i>

15:13.613 --> 15:15.251
<i>Are you serious?</i>

15:15.348 --> 15:17.123
<i>That's not a name.
That's a gated community.</i>

15:17.216 --> 15:18.251
<i>I really don't care.</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:25.698
<i>Holy shit.</i>

15:25.758 --> 15:27.465
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

15:27.560 --> 15:28.868
<i>Holy shit.</i>

15:28.928 --> 15:30.805
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

15:30.897 --> 15:31.773
<i>Try it.</i>

15:31.864 --> 15:33.707
<i>Try what?</i>

15:33.766 --> 15:37.043
<i>You say, "Oh my God" when you
want to say "holy shit."</i>

15:37.103 --> 15:38.047
<i>Oh, my God?</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:44.248
<i>Oh. My. God.</i>

15:44.310 --> 15:46.256
<i>{together}
Oh. My. God.</i>

15:46.312 --> 15:48.417
<i>It's a fashion miracle.</i>

<i>Cameron, it's Kappa
welcome back night!</i>

17:14.666 --> 17:16.339
<i>I have to be there.</i>

17:16.402 --> 17:18.348
<i>You're choosing
your sorority
over my father?</i>

17:18.404 --> 17:20.145
<i>Cotton? Listen to me.
I'm late as it is.</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:22.152
<i>I still have to shave
my chest and meditate</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:23.653
<i>before I meet my parents.</i>

17:23.709 --> 17:25.586
<i>So just meet us
at the horse show.</i>

17:25.678 --> 17:27.487
<i>Cameron, I told you.
I can't!</i>

17:27.547 --> 17:30.084
<i>Cotton, sometimes you can be
such an insipid idiot!</i>

17:30.182 --> 17:32.321
<i>Cameron, I don't know
what that word means.</i>

17:32.385 --> 17:34.865
<i>What kind of idiot doesn't know
what the word "idiot" means?</i>

17:34.921 --> 17:36.332
<i>No, the other one.</i>

17:36.389 --> 17:38.096
<i>Insipid,

<i>I have character, Cameron.</i>

<i>Last year for Halloween,
I was a raspberry!</i>

17:41.694 --> 17:43.833
<i>Just shut up!
Easy there.</i>

17:43.896 --> 17:45.432
<i>You have a problem?</i>

17:45.531 --> 17:47.101
<i>I think you could be
a bit more patient.</i>

17:47.199 --> 17:48.234
<i>Oh, really.</i>

17:56.709 --> 17:57.881
<i>Don't be late.</i>

18:00.947 --> 18:02.858
<i>I hope that wasn't
a first date.</i>

18:02.949 --> 18:05.429
<i>I'm Brook.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.611
<i>What?</i>

19:29.669 --> 19:31.148
<i>You're supposed
to greet me back.</i>

19:31.203 --> 19:32.614
<i>I did.</i>

19:32.672 --> 19:33.878
<i>No, the way
that I greeted you.</i>

19:33.973 --> 19:35.782
<i>Right. Of course.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:37.684
<i>Hello beautiful,
vibrant Kappa sister.</i>

19:37.777 --> 19:39.154
<i>Those are the words
that I used.</i>

19:39.211 --> 19:41.555
<i>You have to use
your own words.</i>

19:41.647 --> 19:46.619
<i>Hello sweet, freshly
manicured, evenly

<i>And you're Brook Stonebridge,

19:53.826 --> 19:55.737
<i>And you're
really well informed.</i>

19:55.828 --> 19:57.535
<i>Now that you've seen
the chapter,</i>

19:57.630 --> 19:59.473
<i>in which you know boys
are never allowed in...</i>

19:59.532 --> 20:01.034
<i>I wasn't planning on it.</i>

20:01.133 --> 20:02.703
<i>Just saying.
Let me show you upstairs.</i>

20:04.170 --> 20:05.376
<i>Come on.</i>

20:07.873 --> 20:10.820
<i>You know, you seem more mature
than the other girls.</i>

20:10.876 --> 20:12.913
<i>That's because I'm older.</i>

20:13.012 --> 20:16.084
<i>I was modelling
in Croatia for three years
before I came here.</i>

20:16.215 --> 20:18.252
<i>Croatia?
Yeah...</i>

20:18.350 --> 20:20.830
<i>People always think
of Milan when they
think of high fashion,</i>

20:20.886 --> 20:23.765
<i>but Croatia is the new
golden age of couture.</i>

20:23.856 --> 20:28.566
<i>Is it?
It's Paris, 1947.</i>

20:34.200 --> 20:36.874
<i>Oh, my God! Under the stars
of the blue southern sky,</i>

20:36.936 --> 20:39.382
<i>where girls become women,
we bake apple pie.</i>

20:39.438 --> 20:42.180
<i>There's fish and there's
trees, there's tents
and there's cheese.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, I don't.</i>

20:50.382 --> 20:53.261
<i>Brook Stonebridge.
I was in cabin Whisper Nine.</i>

20:53.352 --> 20:55.696
<i>I kind of was a loner.
I ate a lot of bugs.</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:57.564
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

20:57.623 --> 20:59.569
<i>Can you believe
what happened
to Shelley Simon?</i>

20:59.625 --> 21:01.627
<i>I know.
Isn't it fantastic?</i>

21:01.727 --> 21:03.707
<i>She lost her arm.</i>

21:03.763 --> 21:07.074
<i>What she's doing
with the other arm,
she's just so strong.</i>

21:07.133 --> 21:09.636
<i>I was really nervous
about transferring here, but...</i>

21:09.735 --> 21:13.046
<i>I am so psyched
that I already have a friend.</i>

21:13.105 --> 21:14.448
<i>Great.</i>

21:16.609 --> 21:18.452
<i>I just love reunions.</i>

21:19.812 --> 21:20.984
<i>Totes.</i>

21:21.080 --> 21:22.753
<i>And this is your room.</i>

21:22.815 --> 21:24.624
<i>Your stuff's here already.</i>

21:27.620 --> 21:29.224
<i>Your roommate Becky
is so great.</i>

21:29.288 --> 21:34.397
<i>You will so love her.
She's so... great.</i>

21:34.460 --> 21:36.565
<i>And she's real,
which is so important,</i>

21:36.629 --> 21:40.338
<i>because, there are just
so many fake girls
in this house.</i>

22:25.010 --> 22:25.988
<i>Hi, y'all.</i>

22:28.380 --> 22:30.121
<i>How did that sound?</i>

22:30.182 --> 22:31.991
<i>I've been working
that accent since last year.</i>

22:32.051 --> 22:33.291
<i>I'm Becky Slotzky.</i>

22:34.887 --> 22:36.491
<i>Oh! My grandparents
just moved there.</i>

22:36.555 --> 22:37.727
<i>I didn't choose the name.</i>

22:37.823 --> 22:39.803
<i>I see
you've met Sasha.</i>

22:39.859 --> 22:42.203
<i>You know, she's really
like that and that's
unmedicated?</i>

22:42.294 --> 22:43.796
<i>Did she drop
the modelling thing?</i>

22:43.863 --> 22:47.572
<i>Oh, yeah. Croatia.
It's Paris in 1947.</i>

22:50.302 --> 22:52.179
<i>I know what
you're thinking.</i>

22:52.238 --> 22:54.377
<i>My mother was a Kappa,
which makes me
like a Siamese.</i>

22:54.473 --> 22:56.851
<i>They have
to let me in.</i>

22:56.909 --> 22:58.820
<i>How did you get
into Kappa, Brook
Stonebridge?</i>

22:58.878 --> 23:01.256
<i>The FBI arranged it.</i>

23:01.347 --> 23:02.655
<i>You're funny.</i>

23:06.418 --> 23:09.365
<i>{crowd noise}</i>

23:40.185 --> 23:41.289
<i>You like it?</i>

23:41.387 --> 23:42.627
<i>Is this a Triumph?</i>

23:42.721 --> 23:44.928
<i>1972.
Restored it myself.</i>

23:45.024 --> 23:47.197
<i>Bonneville engine?
Yeah.</i>

23:47.259 --> 23:49.068
<i>That's rad.</i>

23:49.962 --> 23:51.407
<i>Nicholas.</i>

23:51.463 --> 23:53.204
<i>Brook.</i>

23:53.265 --> 23:55.108
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

23:55.200 --> 23:56.941
<i>You don't go
to school here, do you?</i>

23:57.036 --> 23:58.982
<i>Of course I do.
Why would you
think that I don't?</i>

23:59.071 --> 24:00.880
<i>I'm in my late teens.
I'm walking on campus.</i>

24:00.940 --> 24:04.046
<i>I've got a pretentious name,
a sparkly cell phone.</i>

24:04.109 --> 24:05.611
<i>I don't know,
not many girls here</i>

24:05.711 --> 24:07.088
<i>would know this bike's
a Triumph.</i>

24:07.146 --> 24:11.288
<i>Really? Oh.</i>

24:11.383 --> 24:15.593
<i>Well, I just think
it's amaze-balls.</i>

24:17.556 --> 24:19.593

<i>Okay. I want to live

<i>But not on one of those
cheesy reality shows. No.</i>

25:21.286 --> 25:23.630
<i>I want to be on a really
quality reality show,</i>

25:23.689 --> 25:26.329
<i>so I can have
a billion Twitter followers</i>

25:29.328 --> 25:31.330

a pearl white Bentley, too.</i>

25:33.332 --> 25:35.243
<i>What's your name again?</i>

25:35.334 --> 25:39.043
<i>Brook.
Your turn, Brook.</i>

26:33.926 --> 26:35.564
<i>It's really pretty.</i>

26:38.897 --> 26:42.037
<i>Why is this so important
to all of them?</i>

26:42.101 --> 26:44.809
<i>Well, because this
is their world.</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:49.252
<i>It used to be mine.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry, Alex!</i>

27:03.956 --> 27:06.334
<i>What did you do?
My shirt is ruined!</i>

27:06.425 --> 27:09.736
<i>This was my special
Kappa Kappa Zeta T-shirt!</i>

27:09.795 --> 27:11.297
<i>And you ruined it.</i>

<i>Sisters, welcome back
and welcome home.</i>

28:29.308 --> 28:34.382
<i>It was a summer of change,
a summer of big developments,</i>

28:34.479 --> 28:37.653
<i>and a summer
at making new friends.</i>

28:37.716 --> 28:40.094
<i>We have a year of great
excitement ahead of us,</i>

28:40.185 --> 28:42.756

the Lafitte Cup back</i>

28:44.756 --> 28:46.360
<i>{cheering}</i>

28:46.425 --> 28:49.668
<i>But to do that,
we need to sell more dolls</i>

28:49.728 --> 28:52.231
<i>than any of the other houses.</i>

28:52.331 --> 28:54.834
<i>Kappas, are you up for that?</i>

28:54.900 --> 28:57.005
<i>{cheering}</i>

28:57.069 --> 28:59.606
<i>Okay, let
the festivities begin.</i>

28:59.705 --> 29:09.615
<i>¶¶ It only takes a spark
to get a fire a fire going ¶¶</i>

29:09.715 --> 29:18.635
<i>¶¶ And soon our sisters now
will warm up in its glowing ¶¶</i>

29:18.724 --> 29:21.068
<i>¶¶ That's how it with us ¶¶</i>

29:21.126 --> 29:22.434
<i>Watch out!</i>

<i>Stay down!</i>

29:25.564 --> 29:26.542
<i>{gasping}</i>

29:26.598 --> 29:27.440
<i>Face down!</i>

29:28.900 --> 29:30.208
<i>It's those
godless OAP boys.</i>

29:31.370 --> 29:32.747
<i>{laughing}</i>

29:32.804 --> 29:34.215
<i>They're always trying
to catch us</i>

29:34.273 --> 29:35.877
<i>exercising topless
or something.</i>

29:35.941 --> 29:38.785
<i>They totally caught me once.
I was so mad.</i>

29:40.612 --> 29:43.252
<i>Look, a pretty little fire.</i>

29:45.217 --> 29:47.458
<i>{screaming}</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:54.331
<i>What? You've never
had a shower before?</i>

29:54.426 --> 29:55.996
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

30:00.399 --> 30:01.503
<i>Come on, girls.</i>

30:01.600 --> 30:02.738
<i>Let's go.</i>

30:02.801 --> 30:04.439
<i>Everyone out.</i>

30:04.503 --> 30:05.846
<i>{screaming}</i>

30:08.907 --> 30:11.410
<i>You may as well have turned
to this date on my calendar</i>

30:11.476 --> 30:13.114
<i>and painted it black.</i>

30:13.178 --> 30:16.091
<i>Wow! That was
disturbingly poetic.</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:20.690
<i>Look, I really am sorry.
It was just accident.</i>

30:20.786 --> 30:23.323
<i>No, an accident is like
when you're driving</i>

30:23.422 --> 30:25.299
<i>and you hit a raccoon,
but you don't want to stop</i>

30:25.357 --> 30:27.701
<i>because it turned out
to be somebody's dog.</i>

30:27.793 --> 30:30.296
<i>This is a tragedy.</i>

30:30.362 --> 30:33.707
<i>All right, girls, let's go.</i>

31:02.494 --> 31:05.338
<i>The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act.</i>

31:05.397 --> 31:07.206
<i>RICO allowed law enforcement</i>

31:07.299 --> 31:09.836
<i>to get into areas
that it'd never been before</i>

31:09.901 --> 31:11.903
<i>when it came
to investigating the mafia.</i>

31:12.003 --> 31:13.573
<i>It was a Nixon hustle.</i>

31:14.539 --> 31:16.314
<i>Excuse me?</i>

31:16.375 --> 31:18.651
<i>I'm sorry, but you're
not telling the whole story.</i>

31:18.710 --> 31:20.348
<i>Well, enlighten us.</i>

31:20.412 --> 31:22.221
<i>The Justice Department
used RICO</i>

31:22.314 --> 31:24.351
<i>to go after anybody
on Nixon's hate list.</i>

31:24.416 --> 31:27.659
<i>Gays, liberals, reformers,
subversive students.</i>

31:27.719 --> 31:29.426
<i>Yeah, RICO was enacted
to go after the mob,</i>

31:29.521 --> 31:31.432
<i>but don't tell me
that it wasn't abused.</i>

31:31.523 --> 31:33.059
<i>I won't.
What's your name?</i>

31:34.192 --> 31:35.865
<i>Brook.</i>

31:35.927 --> 31:38.533
<i>How would someone
like you know this, Brook?</i>

31:41.266 --> 31:43.246
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:43.335 --> 31:46.373
<i>I guess I'm just like,
so into crime,
I want to throw up!</i>

31:46.438 --> 31:48.941
<i>{everyone laughs}</i>

31:52.043 --> 31:54.182
<i>Interesting take
on RICO.</i>

31:54.246 --> 31:56.419
<i>I don't really know
what I'm talking about.</i>

31:57.682 --> 31:58.387
<i>Hey Summer!</i>

32:02.254 --> 32:03.858
<i>That was kind of rude.</i>

32:03.922 --> 32:05.959
<i>She was my freshman
roommate last year.</i>

32:06.057 --> 32:07.695
<i>I haven't seen
her since then.</i>

32:07.759 --> 32:09.898
<i>She's probably just
trying to keep it low.</i>

32:09.961 --> 32:11.372
<i>Keep what low?</i>

32:11.430 --> 32:13.034
<i>Her affair
with the good doctor.</i>

32:13.098 --> 32:14.634
<i>{Nicholas}
What are you talking about?</i>

32:14.733 --> 32:16.804
<i>She was probably
in one of his lectures,</i>

32:16.902 --> 32:19.542
<i>and now they're on their way
to have scandalous
motel room sex.</i>

32:19.604 --> 32:22.949
<i>Come on. How do you
know that, Brook?</i>

32:23.041 --> 32:26.420
<i>The parking pass on the back
of his car is preferential
for doctors.</i>

32:26.478 --> 32:28.617
<i>He's not wearing
a wedding ring
but I see the tan line.</i>

32:28.713 --> 32:30.215
<i>She obviously
knows he's married,</i>

32:30.282 --> 32:31.784
<i>so that's not why
he doesn't wear it.</i>

32:31.883 --> 32:33.726
<i>It's a guilt thing
cheating men do.</i>

32:33.785 --> 32:37.562
<i>Wow. All I saw was Summer
and some guy. I'm impressed.</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:39.659
<i>You've got a really nice
sense of deduction Brook.</i>

32:40.992 --> 32:44.405
<i>I developed it early.
What?</i>

32:44.463 --> 32:49.139
<i>I don't know.
I should probably
not talk anymore.</i>

32:49.234 --> 32:51.236
<i>Okay, amaze-balls.</i>

32:51.303 --> 32:54.648
<i>I'm going to go nap now.</i>

33:07.452 --> 33:09.489
<i>Shit.
What's up?</i>

33:09.588 --> 33:12.933
<i>{crunching}
Finance major.</i>

33:12.991 --> 33:15.870
<i>Why can't I be like
everyone else in the house
and just marry one?</i>

33:15.961 --> 33:17.872
<i>{snickers}</i>

33:17.963 --> 33:19.306
<i>What are those books?</i>

33:19.364 --> 33:21.708
<i>Not books, ledgers.
{crunches}</i>

33:21.800 --> 33:24.474
<i>Big, fat accounting ledgers.</i>

33:24.536 --> 33:26.675
<i>You know they have
computers tor that, right?</i>

33:26.771 --> 33:29.274
<i>Our sadist teacher makes
us do it all by hand.</i>

33:29.341 --> 33:31.343
<i>That way we really learn.</i>

33:37.516 --> 33:38.688
<i>I need a break.</i>

33:43.555 --> 33:46.365
<i>See you.
See you.</i>

34:14.418 --> 34:15.864
<i>That's weird.</i>

34:17.188 --> 34:18.826
<i>The house doesn't have a dog.</i>

34:25.163 --> 34:26.107
<i>What are you doing?</i>

34:26.197 --> 34:27.072
<i>Hey, Taylor.</i>

34:29.333 --> 34:30.540
<i>How's it going?</i>

34:32.170 --> 34:34.581
<i>I'm retaining water
and I'm not sure why.</i>

34:36.574 --> 34:38.054
<i>Why are you in our room?</i>

34:38.109 --> 34:43.353
<i>I'm just borrowing
Alex's thong.</i>

34:43.415 --> 34:46.021
<i>You know how we like
to all borrow each
other's stuff.</i>

34:46.083 --> 34:47.927
<i>I guess so.</i>

34:50.722 --> 34:52.860
<i>Brandy.
Huh?</i>

34:52.924 --> 34:56.235
<i>If you drink brandy,
you won't retain
all that water.</i>

34:56.293 --> 34:59.571
<i>Really?
Okay, thanks, Brook.</i>

34:59.631 --> 35:01.042
<i>No prob.</i>

35:02.934 --> 35:04.242
<i>See you.</i>

35:05.403 --> 35:06.711
<i>I'll try that.</i>

35:09.741 --> 35:13.279
<i>{beeping}
Bat phone.</i>

35:41.840 --> 35:43.911
<i>Hi, Brook.
Armon.</i>

35:43.975 --> 35:45.784
<i>You made me ride
the whole streetcar line.</i>

35:45.844 --> 35:47.755
<i>Precautions.</i>

35:47.812 --> 35:49.314
<i>Follow me.</i>

35:49.414 --> 35:50.757
<i>All right, update me.</i>

35:50.815 --> 35:52.453
<i>There's nothing to say.</i>

35:52.517 --> 35:54.463
<i>Look, I know I haven't
been there that long,</i>

35:54.519 --> 35:56.430
<i>but I know dangerous people
and there aren't any there.</i>

35:56.488 --> 35:58.195
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

36:01.593 --> 36:04.699
<i>Oh, my God, that's Bizzy.</i>

36:04.796 --> 36:08.869
<i>Yep, Kashalov
had her killed.</i>

36:08.967 --> 36:10.947
<i>I don't get it.
Why wouldn't they
just kill Alex?</i>

36:11.002 --> 36:12.379
<i>Why would they go
to all the trouble</i>

36:12.470 --> 36:14.177
<i>of planting someone
in her life?</i>

36:14.272 --> 36:16.718
<i>If he has Alex killed,
her father will testify.</i>

36:16.808 --> 36:19.288
<i>The only way he can gain
momentum right now</i>

36:19.344 --> 36:21.119
<i>is by planting
a killer-in-wait.</i>

36:21.179 --> 36:23.022
<i>You have to take
this seriously.</i>

36:23.114 --> 36:25.458
<i>Find out who's not
who they say they are</i>

36:25.517 --> 36:29.294
<i>and try to uncover
any information
about this bargaining chip</i>

36:29.354 --> 36:30.833
<i>that Alex may be holding.</i>

36:53.745 --> 36:56.726
<i>{floor creaks}</i>

36:56.815 --> 36:58.658
<i>{door squeaks}</i>

37:08.359 --> 37:10.168
<i>Wake up! Wake up!
{beating pan}</i>

37:10.228 --> 37:11.206
<i>Move and I shoot!</i>

37:14.199 --> 37:15.405
<i>What the hell, Cotton?</i>

37:17.035 --> 37:19.515
<i>It was a PJ party.
What?</i>

37:19.571 --> 37:21.517
<i>It's a tradition.</i>

37:21.573 --> 37:23.553
<i>We wake each other up
in the middle of the night</i>

37:23.608 --> 37:26.782
<i>then go to a frat party
without showering or changing.</i>

37:26.878 --> 37:29.688
<i>So everyone's showering
and changing right now</i>

37:29.748 --> 37:31.921
<i>to make it look like
they didn't shower or change.</i>

37:32.016 --> 37:34.792
<i>You sleep with a gun?</i>

37:34.886 --> 37:35.796
<i>It's not real.</i>

37:37.188 --> 37:39.930
<i>Of course not.
It's not?</i>

37:41.192 --> 37:42.796
<i>Your money or your life.</i>

37:42.894 --> 37:44.532
<i>I'm going to bust
a cat in your ass.</i>

37:44.596 --> 37:45.939
<i>Give it back.</i>

37:46.030 --> 37:47.771
<i>It's a cap.
What's a cap?</i>

37:47.866 --> 37:50.142
<i>It's bust a cap in your ass.</i>

37:50.235 --> 37:52.078
<i>Why would anybody
put a cap in their ass?</i>

37:52.137 --> 37:54.583
<i>Because, Cotton,
that's what the gangsters do.</i>

37:54.639 --> 37:56.550
<i>That's weird.</i>

37:56.608 --> 37:59.748
<i>Oh! And putting a cat
in your ass isn't
weird at all?</i>

38:01.746 --> 38:03.282
<i>You're a real
Einstein, Cotton.</i>

38:04.716 --> 38:06.491
<i>I am not.</i>

38:12.290 --> 38:16.796
<i>{rap music playing,
crowd noise}</i>

38:43.688 --> 38:45.599
<i>I can't believe you'd
wear that here.</i>

38:45.657 --> 38:47.034
<i>You look like a cheap trick.</i>

38:47.125 --> 38:48.661
<i>You bought this
for my birthday!</i>

38:48.760 --> 38:50.467
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

38:50.528 --> 38:52.166
<i>My father's secretary did
and I signed the card.</i>

38:52.263 --> 38:53.708
<i>And don't you think
for a second</i>

38:53.798 --> 38:55.505
<i>that she's not going
to get fired</i>

38:55.600 --> 38:57.876
<i>for making you look
like a New Jersey housewife!</i>

39:00.538 --> 39:02.540
<i>I guess he's better once
you get to know him?</i>

39:02.640 --> 39:05.143
<i>Not really.
He just called me a housewife.</i>

39:05.210 --> 39:07.713
<i>Cotton, you don't
need to take that.</i>

39:09.681 --> 39:11.217
<i>Wait, did he
just propose to me?</i>

39:11.316 --> 39:13.193
<i>l don't think--</i>

39:14.853 --> 39:16.025
<i>Wow.</i>

39:20.191 --> 39:22.193
<i>Do you think I'm pretty?</i>

39:22.293 --> 39:24.136
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

39:24.195 --> 39:28.575
<i>Sometimes I want to kill you
because you are so pretty.</i>

39:28.666 --> 39:31.806
<i>I'm serious. I think
about killing you a lot.</i>

39:31.870 --> 39:34.646
<i>Oh, you're so sweet.</i>

39:34.706 --> 39:37.312
<i>{whooping, shouting}</i>

39:41.145 --> 39:43.182
<i>Hey! Can I interest
you in a dip</i>

39:43.248 --> 39:44.818
<i>in that white trash
pool over there?</i>

39:44.883 --> 39:46.362
<i>I've already been.</i>

39:46.417 --> 39:47.896
<i>I've got a disease now,
by the way.</i>

39:47.986 --> 39:50.523
<i>Hey, it happens
to the best of us.</i>

39:50.588 --> 39:52.659
<i>If you want to go and take
your mind off of it, or...</i>

39:52.724 --> 39:54.328
<i>Can you not do that?
Thank you.</i>

39:54.392 --> 39:56.099
<i>There is this amazing
old school jazz band</i>

39:56.194 --> 39:57.434
<i>you got to let me
take you to see.</i>

39:57.528 --> 39:59.166
<i>It's in the French Quarter</i>

39:59.230 --> 40:01.039
<i>and it's not a place
students usually go,</i>

40:01.099 --> 40:03.010
<i>but I promise
you'll have
a lot of fun.</i>

40:03.067 --> 40:05.377
<i>{grunts}</i>

40:05.436 --> 40:07.279
<i>Not really here
to have fun.</i>

40:07.372 --> 40:10.080
<i>Besides, I hate
the French.</i>

40:12.577 --> 40:15.217
<i>This is so unlike me!</i>

40:16.948 --> 40:20.452
<i>I touched the bottom!
I touched the bottom!</i>

40:22.353 --> 40:23.764
<i>That's it for today.</i>

40:23.855 --> 40:25.391
<i>I appreciate
the majority of you</i>

40:25.456 --> 40:27.732
<i>taking this unit seriously.</i>

40:27.792 --> 40:30.295
<i>Remember, your papers
are due next week.</i>

40:30.395 --> 40:31.738
<i>Make them great.</i>

40:41.539 --> 40:42.882
<i>So, what do we have here?</i>

40:42.941 --> 40:43.976
<i>{bat phone beeps}</i>

40:46.644 --> 40:49.716
<i>{organ music, footsteps}</i>

41:04.629 --> 41:05.903
<i>What do you got?</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:07.739
<i>Professor Nathan Talloway.</i>

41:07.799 --> 41:09.904
<i>He's been teaching
for about a year-and-a-half</i>

41:09.968 --> 41:11.675
<i>but the guy has nothing
on his background.</i>

41:11.769 --> 41:13.248
<i>He is a complete ghost.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:15.978
<i>Is she sleeping with him?
Possibly.</i>

41:16.074 --> 41:18.748
<i>Sasha's not telling the truth
about her past either.</i>

41:18.810 --> 41:20.585
<i>How do you know that?</i>

41:20.645 --> 41:22.682
<i>She claims she modelled
in Croatia for three years,</i>

41:22.780 --> 41:24.191
<i>which is smarter
than saying Paris</i>

41:24.282 --> 41:25.590
<i>because it's
a memorable detail</i>

41:25.650 --> 41:27.527
<i>that helps sell the lie.</i>

41:27.618 --> 41:30.690
<i>It's called a unique qualifier.
I use them all the time.</i>

41:30.788 --> 41:33.359
<i>When she told me,
she leaned her head back,
looked to the right,</i>

41:33.458 --> 41:35.199
<i>and widened her eyes
and touched her lip.</i>

41:35.293 --> 41:37.295
<i>These are non-verbal tells
of deception in women.</i>

41:37.362 --> 41:39.171
<i>What about guys?
Is she dating anyone?</i>

41:39.263 --> 41:41.504
<i>There's Nicholas Dexter
in our criminal justice class</i>

41:41.599 --> 41:43.135
<i>but I don't think
it's romantic.</i>

41:43.201 --> 41:45.044
<i>What about him?</i>

41:45.136 --> 41:47.343
<i>He's smart and he's got
this boyish charm
about him,</i>

41:47.438 --> 41:49.315
<i>but he's not as immature
as the other frat boys.</i>

41:49.374 --> 41:51.650
<i>Jesus.
{nun gasps}
God bless you.</i>

41:51.709 --> 41:52.949
<i>What?</i>

41:53.011 --> 41:54.820
<i>You're into him.
Am not!</i>

41:54.879 --> 41:57.291
<i>And BTW's, if anything,
he's the one crushing on me.</i>

41:57.348 --> 41:59.294
<i>BTW's?
By the way.</i>

41:59.350 --> 42:01.125
<i>Crushing on you?
What does that mean?</i>

42:01.185 --> 42:03.825
<i>He kind of asked me out.</i>

42:03.888 --> 42:05.333
<i>Are you going to
go out with him?</i>

42:05.390 --> 42:07.233
<i>I told him that
I hate the French.</i>

42:07.325 --> 42:09.828
<i>No, I'm not here to date.</i>

42:09.894 --> 42:12.738
<i>Obviously, but you are here</i>

42:12.830 --> 42:15.572
<i>to investigate anyone
that comes into her life.</i>

42:15.666 --> 42:19.842
<i>I'm going to get some Intel
on the professor.
You investigate Sasha.</i>

42:19.904 --> 42:21.383
<i>And go out with Nicholas.</i>

42:21.472 --> 42:22.974
<i>I don't think going out
with Nicholas</i>

42:23.041 --> 42:24.349
<i>is the best way
to go about this.</i>

42:24.409 --> 42:26.218
<i>Of course it is.
What else?</i>

42:26.310 --> 42:28.153
<i>I'm writing this
totally kick-ass paper</i>

42:28.212 --> 42:30.988
<i>about the pros
and cons of RICO.</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:33.086
<i>What does that
have to do with Alex?</i>

42:34.218 --> 42:35.720
<i>Nothing, I guess.</i>

42:39.757 --> 42:43.762
<i>{talking, dog barking}</i>

42:43.861 --> 42:45.169
<i>How's your head?</i>

42:45.229 --> 42:46.367
<i>Yeah, I know.
See you later.</i>

42:55.907 --> 42:56.851
<i>Brook!</i>

42:56.908 --> 42:58.512
<i>Hey, Brook!</i>

42:59.744 --> 43:00.848
<i>Nicholas, hey.</i>

43:00.912 --> 43:02.357
<i>How are you doing?</i>

43:02.413 --> 43:04.051
<i>Did you enjoy
the party last night?</i>

43:04.182 --> 43:08.096
<i>Yeah. Just been
so busy with school.
Yeah.</i>

43:08.186 --> 43:10.564
<i>Wish I could just
burn off some steam.</i>

43:10.621 --> 43:15.127
<i>Go to some old jazz club
or something, just let loose.</i>

43:15.226 --> 43:17.763
<i>There's that place I told you
about in the French Quarter,</i>

43:17.862 --> 43:20.365
<i>but it's swarming
with lazy French people.</i>

43:20.431 --> 43:22.138
<i>Maybe they deserve
a second chance.</i>

43:22.233 --> 43:23.541
<i>Yeah, tell that to Algeria.</i>

43:23.601 --> 43:25.603
<i>{laughs}</i>

43:25.703 --> 43:31.051
<i>I don't know what that means,
but I bet it was really funny.</i>

43:31.109 --> 43:32.713
<i>Yeah, maybe I'll do that.</i>

43:32.777 --> 43:34.984
<i>If you don't mind,
I'd love to tag along.</i>

43:36.214 --> 43:37.215
<i>Your balls are amazing.</i>

43:38.316 --> 43:40.091
<i>My balls?</i>

43:40.218 --> 43:44.291
<i>I meant to say
that would be amaze-balls.
Right.</i>

43:45.456 --> 43:47.163
<i>I think I got to go.</i>

43:47.258 --> 43:48.430
<i>You okay, Brook?</i>

43:48.493 --> 43:50.905
<i>Yeah, me?
I'm great!</i>

43:50.962 --> 43:52.964
<i>I'm the bomb dot com.</i>

43:56.567 --> 43:59.446
<i>All right, well,
I'll see you tonight.
See you!</i>

43:59.504 --> 44:02.508
<i>{jazz music, laughter}</i>

44:04.475 --> 44:07.854
<i>If you're not
from New Orleans,
let me hear you scream.</i>

44:07.945 --> 44:09.583
<i>{screaming}</i>

44:09.647 --> 44:11.422
<i>The greatest music
created and nobody cares.</i>

44:11.482 --> 44:12.586
<i>You from here?</i>

44:12.650 --> 44:14.129
<i>Listen to that.</i>

44:14.185 --> 44:15.823
<i>That is all about
call and response.</i>

44:18.956 --> 44:20.367
<i>You're not
into this, are you?</i>

44:20.458 --> 44:21.960
<i>No, I am.</i>

44:22.026 --> 44:23.972
<i>I just wanted
to get to know you more.</i>

44:24.028 --> 44:26.474
<i>Me?
Well, you're the bigger
mystery than me.</i>

44:26.531 --> 44:28.340
<i>Yeah! You come out of nowhere,</i>

44:28.432 --> 44:31.345
<i>you know about motorcycles
and RICO statutes,</i>

44:31.435 --> 44:33.312
<i>then suddenly you're
this little Kappa girl</i>

44:33.371 --> 44:36.352
<i>who's the bomb dot com
and just wants to throw up.</i>

44:37.475 --> 44:38.977
<i>Where are you from?</i>

44:39.043 --> 44:41.114
<i>And that is harmony
and interpretation.</i>

44:41.179 --> 44:42.783
<i>Why won't you answer me?</i>

44:43.881 --> 44:45.189
<i>I'm just into this.</i>

44:45.283 --> 44:47.854
<i>Are you hiding something?
No.</i>

44:49.487 --> 44:50.830
<i>No, you can
ask me anything.</i>

44:50.888 --> 44:52.390
<i>Have you ever killed somebody?</i>

44:56.561 --> 44:58.199
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

44:58.296 --> 45:00.037
<i>You've got a strange
sense of humour, Brook.</i>

45:00.131 --> 45:01.337
<i>Yeah. Love it or leave it.</i>

45:02.533 --> 45:04.035
<i>So?</i>

45:06.904 --> 45:09.043
<i>I'm from Florida.</i>

45:17.715 --> 45:20.525
<i>He kept on asking me
about a job,</i>

45:20.585 --> 45:21.928
<i>a job this
and a job that,</i>

45:22.019 --> 45:23.555
<i>and I said I didn't
want a job,</i>

45:23.654 --> 45:25.258
<i>that I was trying
really hard in school,</i>

45:25.356 --> 45:27.393
<i>and I was
on the baseball team</i>

45:27.491 --> 45:30.062
<i>and I didn't
have time for a job.</i>

45:30.161 --> 45:34.667
<i>He just looked at me
and told me he was leaving,</i>

45:34.732 --> 45:36.268
<i>that he met a woman,</i>

45:36.367 --> 45:38.506
<i>that he didn't love
my mother anymore,</i>

45:38.569 --> 45:42.016
<i>and that I was going to have
to take care of her
and my sister.</i>

45:42.073 --> 45:43.950
<i>And he told me it
just like that,</i>

45:44.041 --> 45:46.681
<i>like he was telling me
what to pick up
from the store.</i>

45:49.413 --> 45:54.385
<i>And that's why I quit
playing baseball
in high school.</i>

45:54.452 --> 45:57.558
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't plan
on telling you that story.
It's okay.</i>

46:00.591 --> 46:03.538
<i>We're at your house again.</i>

46:03.594 --> 46:05.130
<i>One more time
around the block?</i>

46:05.229 --> 46:06.936
<i>I've walked you home
six times tonight.</i>

46:08.099 --> 46:09.635
<i>Let's make it seven.</i>

46:14.138 --> 46:17.381
<i>So, what about you?
Are your parents together?</i>

46:17.441 --> 46:19.921
<i>No, my mom died
when I was younger.</i>

46:19.977 --> 46:23.220
<i>No.
Did your dad remarry?</i>

46:23.281 --> 46:24.783
<i>What's he do?</i>

46:24.882 --> 46:26.759
<i>{clears throat}</i>

46:26.817 --> 46:28.956
<i>I don't really want to get
into it right now, Nicholas.</i>

46:31.756 --> 46:33.292
<i>Don't be mad at me.</i>

46:33.391 --> 46:34.893
<i>l'm not mad, I just--</i>

46:34.959 --> 46:36.939
<i>I've been opening up
to you all night,</i>

46:36.994 --> 46:42.000
<i>and you deflect
any real question
I ask you about yourself.</i>

46:42.099 --> 46:44.943
<i>I just don't trust
people that easy.</i>

46:45.002 --> 46:47.642
<i>I don't have the most faith
in relationships. That's all.</i>

46:47.738 --> 46:48.944
<i>Why not?</i>

46:49.006 --> 46:50.986
<i>Because I've been there.</i>

46:51.075 --> 46:54.318
<i>I've seen it. People lie
and they misrepresent
themselves</i>

46:54.412 --> 46:55.686
<i>and they let
each other down.</i>

46:57.648 --> 46:59.924
<i>Well, I don't lie.</i>

46:59.984 --> 47:02.430
<i>I don't misrepresent myself.</i>

47:02.486 --> 47:06.263
<i>And as far as I know,
I don't let anyone down.</i>

47:26.444 --> 47:28.287
<i>You better be
who you say you are,</i>

47:29.780 --> 47:32.158
<i>because I'll know
if you're not.</i>

47:56.073 --> 47:58.519
<i>Pull it together, Morris.</i>

47:58.576 --> 48:00.146
<i>{scream}</i>

48:02.213 --> 48:05.194
<i>Oh my God! Look!
The Lafitte dolls came in!</i>

48:05.249 --> 48:07.559
<i>Look, aren't they adorable?</i>

48:09.820 --> 48:13.324
<i>I had this terrible dream
that Taylor was in our room.</i>

48:14.692 --> 48:16.729
<i>Oh, it really is you.</i>

48:18.929 --> 48:21.910
<i>We have to sell at least
a hundred at the event
tomorrow.</i>

48:21.999 --> 48:23.706
<i>Okay.</i>

48:23.768 --> 48:26.009
<i>Oh, and Brook,
thank you so much
for the tip.</i>

48:26.070 --> 48:29.449
<i>I've been drinking like a ton
of brandy and I'm feeling
a lot better.</i>

48:29.540 --> 48:34.182
<i>And I'm actually fitting
into my can't-breathe
jeans again.</i>

48:34.245 --> 48:37.226
<i>It's like that amazing time
I had the stomach flu.</i>

48:37.281 --> 48:40.091
<i>Anyways, you're the best.
I'll talk to you later.</i>

48:40.184 --> 48:42.460
<i>Sleeping.
Like I care.</i>

48:47.124 --> 48:49.104
<i>Okay, team.</i>

48:49.193 --> 48:51.366
<i>How are we going to get
people dying to buy
these dolls?</i>

48:51.429 --> 48:54.433
<i>I know! We can give away
a can of my homemade mace
as a prize.</i>

48:54.532 --> 48:56.102
<i>{everyone}
No.</i>

48:56.200 --> 48:58.544
<i>We can think
at something better.</i>

48:58.602 --> 49:01.208
<i>Come on, girls.
Let's sell some products.</i>

49:01.272 --> 49:04.583
<i>Cotton, you make
your own mace?</i>

49:04.642 --> 49:07.248
<i>Yeah. I'm a chemistry major.</i>

49:07.311 --> 49:09.416
<i>You're a chemistry major?</i>

49:09.480 --> 49:11.221
<i>Yes, Brook.</i>

49:11.282 --> 49:13.387
<i>I'm going to become
a perfumer like Annick Goutal.</i>

49:15.319 --> 49:17.560
<i>They're just upset
because my last prototype</i>

49:17.621 --> 49:19.328
<i>burned some holes
through leather purses.</i>

49:19.423 --> 49:20.629
<i>But I've perfected it now.</i>

49:20.724 --> 49:23.000
<i>Here. This one's for you.</i>

49:23.093 --> 49:25.664
<i>See, there's a place
for keys on it and there's
a little flashlight.</i>

49:25.763 --> 49:27.071
<i>Thank you, Cotton.</i>

49:27.131 --> 49:29.338
<i>Use it wisely.
{both laugh}</i>

49:29.433 --> 49:32.505
<i>Wait, at least I think
that's the one I perfected.</i>

49:34.338 --> 49:35.976
<i>Buy a doll.</i>

49:41.345 --> 49:43.484
<i>Buy a doll,
play with balls!</i>

49:45.816 --> 49:47.796
<i>Buy a doll,
play with balls.</i>

49:47.852 --> 49:51.425
<i>Didn't Lady Gaga
wear that at the \/MA's?</i>

49:51.489 --> 49:53.594
<i>Brook?
No.</i>

49:53.657 --> 49:56.604
<i>I recognize your voice.</i>

49:56.660 --> 49:59.106
<i>Well, aren't you
just the great detective?</i>

49:59.163 --> 50:01.268
<i>Okay, so let me
get this straight.</i>

50:01.332 --> 50:04.313
<i>You're a fighting crawdad
who's encouraging people
to buy a doll</i>

50:04.368 --> 50:07.713
<i>so that they can play inside
of a giant inflatable
child's toy</i>

50:07.805 --> 50:10.285
<i>that's more of a liability
nightmare than anything else?</i>

50:10.341 --> 50:10.978
<i>Bingo!</i>

50:15.813 --> 50:18.521
<i>Not happening.</i>

50:18.616 --> 50:20.562
<i>The only thing you
will be kissing is my ass.</i>

50:20.651 --> 50:24.724
<i>I'm done. I'm done.
Screw the dolls, I'm done!</i>

50:24.822 --> 50:26.130
<i>Have you sold
many dolls?</i>

50:26.190 --> 50:27.635
<i>Believe it or not, no.</i>

50:27.691 --> 50:29.170
<i>Where's everybody going?</i>

50:29.226 --> 50:31.137
<i>Oh, the Alpha Lambda
Alpha carwash.</i>

50:32.329 --> 50:34.206
<i>Alpha car wash?</i>

50:36.867 --> 50:40.474
<i>{cheering, talking}</i>

51:02.493 --> 51:05.770
<i>It's basically prostitution
with detergent if you ask me.</i>

51:07.865 --> 51:10.903
<i>They are
so lucky they had
bad childhoods.</i>

51:11.001 --> 51:13.379
<i>There's no way we're going
to sell all of our dolls
in two days</i>

51:13.437 --> 51:15.110
<i>with our clothes on.</i>

51:15.205 --> 51:16.684
<i>We have to come up
with something.</i>

51:16.740 --> 51:18.742
<i>{screaming, cheering}</i>

51:18.842 --> 51:20.685
<i>Woooo!</i>

51:20.744 --> 51:22.690
<i>We're going to win
the Lafitte Cup,
I promise you.</i>

51:22.746 --> 51:23.724
<i>How?</i>

51:28.085 --> 51:29.257
<i>Just trust me.</i>

51:30.788 --> 51:33.132
<i>That guy looks
so much like Cameron.</i>

51:36.760 --> 51:38.865
<i>Come on.
Don't let me down.</i>

51:41.765 --> 51:43.540
<i>There we are.</i>

51:43.601 --> 51:46.445
<i>{shutter clicking}</i>

51:52.276 --> 51:54.654
<i>Dr. Milton?
Yes.</i>

51:56.413 --> 51:58.484
<i>Have we met?</i>

51:58.582 --> 52:01.222
<i>No, but I can promise you
you're going to want
to be my friend.</i>

52:03.320 --> 52:05.561
<i>Really?
Really.</i>

52:16.266 --> 52:18.405
<i>The waterbed one's
my favourite.</i>

52:18.469 --> 52:19.948
<i>It really brings out
your smile.</i>

52:20.004 --> 52:22.006
<i>It would be a great
Christmas card.</i>

52:26.910 --> 52:28.583
<i>What do you want?</i>

52:28.646 --> 52:30.023
<i>Here you go, Dr. Milton.</i>

52:30.114 --> 52:31.650
<i>Thank you.
I'm happy to help.</i>

52:31.749 --> 52:33.422
<i>You know how important
this is to me.</i>

52:33.484 --> 52:35.191
<i>The negatives
are in the box.</i>

52:36.453 --> 52:37.363
<i>Are we done?</i>

52:37.454 --> 52:38.865
<i>Yep. See you.</i>

52:38.956 --> 52:40.594
<i>Thank you.</i>

52:44.161 --> 52:45.697
<i>Brook, how'd you do it?</i>

52:45.796 --> 52:47.537
<i>Oh, I just had
to convince him</i>

52:47.631 --> 52:49.372
<i>that all the sick kids
in his ward</i>

52:49.466 --> 52:51.776
<i>deserve to love crawdaddys
like everybody else.</i>

52:51.835 --> 52:53.280
<i>So Christian of him.</i>

52:53.337 --> 52:54.941
<i>Talk about a man
with a big heart.</i>

52:55.005 --> 52:56.985
<i>Yep, and he shares it
with everybody.</i>

52:57.041 --> 52:59.453
<i>Oh, my God! I can't believe
you sold all our dolls!</i>

52:59.510 --> 53:00.887
<i>{cheering}</i>

53:13.023 --> 53:14.502
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

53:14.558 --> 53:15.866
<i>{knocking}</i>

53:15.959 --> 53:17.700
<i>Brook, hey.</i>

53:17.795 --> 53:19.638
<i>I know we've gotten off
to a rocky start</i>

53:19.697 --> 53:22.177
<i>but I want to smooth
things over.</i>

53:22.232 --> 53:25.145
<i>Come here.</i>

53:25.202 --> 53:28.672
<i>Sister dysfunction
is just so toxic,
you know?</i>

53:28.739 --> 53:30.343
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:30.407 --> 53:32.478
<i>Taylor says you helped
her water problem,</i>

53:32.543 --> 53:34.489
<i>and Cotton says
you've been defending her</i>

53:34.545 --> 53:36.422
<i>when Cameron
gets out of hand.</i>

53:36.513 --> 53:38.652
<i>If it wasn't for you,
we'd never have sold
those dolls</i>

53:38.716 --> 53:40.718
<i>and everybody
obvi loves you.</i>

53:45.389 --> 53:46.993
<i>My bracelet.</i>

53:47.057 --> 53:48.934
<i>I would be honoured
if you were to wear it.</i>

53:49.927 --> 53:52.168
<i>Cool, thanks.</i>

53:52.229 --> 53:55.267
<i>No, really, Brook,
where I come from,
this is a really big deal.</i>

53:55.365 --> 53:59.677
<i>But this is a bracelet,
with the words "Mother
Green Earth"</i>

53:59.737 --> 54:03.583
<i>surrounded by real
crusted pink
moissanites.</i>

54:03.674 --> 54:07.918
<i>Wow. Thanks, Sasha.
I love it.</i>

54:08.011 --> 54:09.615
<i>Are you going
to put it on?</i>

54:09.713 --> 54:12.592
<i>Duh!
{both laugh}</i>

54:15.052 --> 54:18.192
<i>OMFG, it's so cute.</i>

54:18.255 --> 54:22.533
<i>You threw the F in there,
so it must be super cute.</i>

54:32.136 --> 54:34.309
<i>Hi, Brook!
Good morning.</i>

54:37.775 --> 54:39.618
<i>Good morning, Brook.</i>

54:39.710 --> 54:40.950
<i>Hey, come eat with us.</i>

54:41.044 --> 54:42.114
<i>I'll save you
a seat, okay?</i>

54:42.212 --> 54:43.247
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

54:46.650 --> 54:47.890
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

54:47.951 --> 54:50.261
<i>Get what?
The bracelet.</i>

54:51.555 --> 54:52.898
<i>Oh, Sasha
gave it to me.</i>

54:52.956 --> 54:54.663
<i>That's my bracelet.</i>

54:54.758 --> 54:56.635
<i>That was my mother's
bracelet before.</i>

54:56.727 --> 54:57.967
<i>Her name is
right there on it.</i>

54:58.061 --> 55:00.268
<i>That says Green Earth.</i>

55:00.330 --> 55:02.105
<i>Your mom's name
was Green Earth?</i>

55:02.166 --> 55:03.474
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

55:03.567 --> 55:05.240
<i>Was she a hippie?</i>

55:05.302 --> 55:07.976
<i>No, Brook. She was 100%
Waccamaw-Siouan Indian.</i>

55:08.071 --> 55:09.641
<i>Do you have
a problem with that?</i>

55:09.740 --> 55:12.016
<i>No, it's just you don't
really look Indian.</i>

55:12.109 --> 55:14.180
<i>I was adopted.
Do you have
a problem with that?</i>

55:14.278 --> 55:17.259
<i>No. Sasha!
Sasha gave it to me.</i>

55:17.314 --> 55:19.294
<i>Sasha, can you came here
for a minute, please?</i>

55:21.985 --> 55:23.987
<i>Did you give Brook
this bracelet?</i>

55:24.121 --> 55:26.032
<i>What?
No, I don't
think so.</i>

55:27.591 --> 55:29.093
<i>That's your mother's
name, isn't it?</i>

55:29.159 --> 55:30.934
<i>Okay. I see
what's going on here.</i>

55:30.994 --> 55:33.270
<i>Oh, my God, Brook.</i>

55:33.330 --> 55:36.470
<i>I think we found
our kleptomaniac.</i>

55:38.468 --> 55:39.947
<i>That's my iPod.</i>

55:40.003 --> 55:42.609
<i>That's my Eyelicious
moisturizer.</i>

55:42.673 --> 55:45.620
<i>My neck massager?</i>

55:45.676 --> 55:47.553
<i>There's going to be
a hearing on this, Brook.</i>

55:47.644 --> 55:49.453
<i>You may be
out of the house.</i>

55:49.513 --> 55:51.993
<i>You have no idea
who you're messing with.</i>

55:57.120 --> 55:59.794
<i>I guess Cameron
was right about you, Brook.</i>

55:59.857 --> 56:01.165
<i>You're no sister of mine.</i>

56:01.225 --> 56:05.367
<i>Sasha set me up.
With who?</i>

56:05.495 --> 56:10.035
<i>I didn't steal
anything, Cotton.
I don't believe you.</i>

56:17.641 --> 56:20.520
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

56:33.090 --> 56:34.569
<i>Klepto.</i>

56:34.658 --> 56:36.365
<i>{indistinct}</i>

56:37.761 --> 56:39.365
<i>Tell me something
good, please.</i>

56:39.429 --> 56:41.204
<i>I'm sorry, honey,
but I checked everything.</i>

56:41.265 --> 56:44.371
<i>I checked the Tenet system,
the Texas DMV backlogs.</i>

56:44.434 --> 56:47.074
<i>I checked six other record
and notification databases</i>

56:47.170 --> 56:49.878
<i>and there's nothing
for a Sasha Stolezinsky.</i>

56:49.940 --> 56:53.012
<i>All right, it's fine.
I'll figure it out.</i>

56:53.076 --> 56:54.453
<i>How are you?</i>

56:54.544 --> 56:58.287
<i>I'm going to a meeting.
Good.</i>

56:59.683 --> 57:02.186
<i>I love you.
I love you, too.</i>

57:08.392 --> 57:09.769
<i>They don't hate you.</i>

57:09.860 --> 57:11.032
<i>Yes, they do.</i>

57:11.094 --> 57:12.971
<i>They think I'm a klepto.</i>

57:15.532 --> 57:17.034
<i>What are you doing?</i>

57:17.100 --> 57:18.704
<i>I'm making sure
I still have my wallet.</i>

57:18.769 --> 57:21.409
<i>Stop! I'm serious.</i>

57:21.471 --> 57:22.973
<i>They were just starting
to accept me,</i>

57:23.073 --> 57:24.814
<i>and now I've become
the enemy,</i>

57:24.908 --> 57:28.219
<i>which, trust me,
doesn't help anything.</i>

57:28.278 --> 57:30.588
<i>You're a girl. Didn't you
deal with this stuff
growing up?</i>

57:30.647 --> 57:32.126
<i>I worked a lot.</i>

57:32.215 --> 57:34.388
<i>What kind of work
did you do?</i>

57:34.451 --> 57:37.295
<i>Photography.
What, like weddings?</i>

57:37.387 --> 57:44.737
<i>No, more nature photography.
Mostly dogs.</i>

57:44.795 --> 57:46.274
<i>They don't
hate you, Brook.</i>

57:46.396 --> 57:50.173
<i>Okay, nobody
can hate you.
Thanks.</i>

57:51.835 --> 57:55.408
<i>I'm really happy
you're here.
So am I.</i>

57:55.472 --> 57:57.076
<i>You're amazing.</i>

57:57.140 --> 57:59.086
<i>Well, it's actually
my balls are amazing.</i>

57:59.142 --> 58:00.450
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

58:00.510 --> 58:02.285
<i>You're the one
that said it.</i>

58:02.346 --> 58:03.825
<i>I have to go.</i>

58:09.920 --> 58:11.695
<i>Now I have to go.</i>

58:18.328 --> 58:20.808
<i>{crowd noise}</i>

58:28.005 --> 58:29.109
<i>Okay, Sasha.</i>

59:09.046 --> 59:10.684
<i>Here we go.</i>

59:15.218 --> 59:16.697
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

59:16.753 --> 59:18.699
<i>I was hoping
you were a kidnapper.</i>

59:18.755 --> 59:21.099
<i>Nope. Just me.
Everybody's least
favourite Kappa sister.</i>

59:21.191 --> 59:24.400
<i>You know they already
have a nickname for you?</i>

59:24.494 --> 59:26.337
<i>I won't tell you
if you don't want
to hear it.</i>

59:26.396 --> 59:27.773
<i>Thanks.</i>

59:27.864 --> 59:30.674
<i>Fingers.
Fingers Stonebridge.</i>

59:30.734 --> 59:33.340
<i>That's an improvement
over Brook, don't you think?</i>

59:34.738 --> 59:36.445
<i>Becky, I'm not a klepto.</i>

59:36.540 --> 59:38.019
<i>What's that?</i>

59:38.075 --> 59:40.214
<i>Something I stole
from Sasha's room.</i>

59:41.878 --> 59:44.620
<i>Oh, my God. Becky,
you've got to see this.</i>

59:48.018 --> 59:49.463
<i>That's Sasha!</i>

59:49.553 --> 59:50.861
<i>Yeah, but it's not
her real name.</i>

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:12.486
<i>There are just so many
fake girls in this house.</i>

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.887
<i>I just hate fake people,
don't you, Sasha?</i>

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.153
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.493
<i>Your name's Suzy Walters,
not Sasha Stolezinsky.</i>

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:26.226
<i>You never modelled
in Croatia.</i>

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.462
<i>You've never
even been to Croatia.</i>

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.164
<i>You were working
at a Taco Bell when you
got your scholarship here,</i>

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.740
<i>and you were
40 pounds heavier.</i>

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.610
<i>Why do you
have a gun, Brook?</i>

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.508
<i>Because I'm here
looking for someone</i>

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:40.411
<i>who's not who
they say they are,
and I found you.</i>

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.246
<i>Why the lies, Suzy?</i>

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.580
<i>Are you going
to shoot me?</i>

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.746
<i>I doubt it.
Why the lies?</i>

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.758
<i>Because when I got
into college, I had
the chance to start over.</i>

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.658
<i>All my life,
I've been on the outside.</i>

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.323
<i>Sweet sixteen’s
and proms and boys.</i>

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.597
<i>You don't know
what it feels like</i>

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.534
<i>to watch it all go by,
so you sit on the sideline.</i>

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:03.934
<i>Actually, Suzy, I do.</i>

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.103
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.371
<i>Your new best friend.</i>

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:15.215
<i>Commencing the Kappa Kappa
Zeta disciplinary hearing.</i>

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.683
<i>We are all here today to hear
Brook Stonebridge's version</i>

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.481
<i>of why she stole
all our stuff.</i>

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.716
<i>{whispers}
Allegedly.</i>

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:25.156
<i>I don't know
what that word means.</i>

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:27.058
<i>Just say it.</i>

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.151
<i>Allegedly.</i>

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:32.160
<i>Brook,
what do you have
to say for yourself?</i>

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.495
<i>Kleptomania is a disease.</i>

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:38.563
<i>It's all about bulimia
in this house and I
totally get that.</i>

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.336
<i>But we shouldn't cast off
the kleptomaniac</i>

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.208
<i>because they also
have a disease.</i>

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:50.507
<i>Would we dump the diabetic?</i>

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.587
<i>Abandon the epileptic?</i>

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:58.421
<i>Come on, girls.
We're supposed
to be sisters.</i>

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:01.826
<i>So with that said,
I implore you all
to forgive</i>

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:05.355
<i>and open your hearts
to a sister in need.</i>

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.846
<i>I stole all the stuff
and planted it on Brook.</i>

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:19.846
<i>{all gasp}</i>

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.246
<i>I knew it.</i>

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:23.340
<i>You better not
have used it.</i>

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.751
<i>{chattering}</i>

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.420
<i>That's sad.</i>

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:36.088
<i>{applause}</i>

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:43.704
<i>Hey Brook, I'm so sorry
that I hated you</i>

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.205
<i>and spread all
those nasty rumours.</i>

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.264
<i>What?
What?</i>

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.870
<i>It is such a relief
to let go of the lies.</i>

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.814
<i>I'm so happy
you all don't hate me.</i>

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.714
<i>Well, Brook put it best.</i>

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.981

My dog had it once.</i>

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.595
<i>Alex!</i>

<i>Alex!
Are you okay?</i>

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.232
<i>You wouldn't understand.</i>

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:17.931
<i>Try me.</i>

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.837
<i>I know you're new
and trying to make friends,</i>

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.000
<i>but there are problems
in the real world</i>

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.669
<i>that are a lot bigger
than asshole boyfriends
or Lafitte dolls.</i>

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:30.510
<i>These problems are very real
and way bigger than anything</i>

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:32.678
<i>you need to solve
in order to fit in.</i>

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.312
<i>Okay.</i>

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.524

Don't mind him.</i>

01:05:12.175 --> 01:05:15.247

down in Sumter</i>

<i>where he hooked up
with a top Kashalov
lieutenant.</i>

<i>If he worked with Kashalov
on the inside</i>

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:25.087
<i>then obviously he's working
with him now on the outside.</i>

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.593
<i>This isn't right.</i>

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:31.499
<i>No. What about the Professor?
What about what I told you?</i>

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:34.194
<i>Alex is obviously
sleeping with him.</i>

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.271

<i>Jason had kept
Kashalov's books.</i>

<i>"Somebody who gets
close to Alex."</i>

<i>You're only making
this thing worse.</i>

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.985
<i>Me. I was the killer
the whole time.</i>

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.758
<i>Bravo. You pack
a mean punch.</i>

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.595
<i>Now I know why
you didn't kill me.</i>

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.532
<i>You needed me
to take the fall for you.</i>

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:57.467
<i>Smart. See you actually did
learn something in college.</i>

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:58.937
<i>Who's Bizzy?</i>

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.474
<i>It doesn't matter
now, does it?</i>

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.509
<i>You killed her.
I did not kill her.</i>

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.280
<i>We had to cover our tracks
on this thing, okay?</i>

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.337
<i>I didn't kill her.</i>

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.815
<i>Give me Alex and I give
you the ledgers.</i>

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.682
<i>You heard me.
I found them.</i>

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.187
<i>I'll give you fifty
thousand for them.</i>

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:21.852
<i>No, you brought me here
to protect Alex Patrone...</i>

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:23.988
<i>and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.</i>

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.862
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:28.026
<i>You're going to protect
some sorority bitch?</i>

01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:30.161
<i>You know you really
got me with that</i>

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.331
<i>"do something real,
make a difference,
join the FBI" bullshit.</i>

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:34.534

<i>Answer the phone
when it rings.</i>

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.975
<i>If you have me
followed, the ledgers
go to the real FBI.</i>

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.708
<i>Yeah.
Got it?</i>

01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:43.841
<i>Oh, and that sorority bitch
is my Kappa sister.</i>

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:48.913
<i>What time did Brook
leave the house?</i>

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:52.049
<i>I do not know.
I am not my sister's keeper.</i>

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:54.822
<i>What time do you

<i>FBI.</i>

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.901
<i>Molly Morris?</i>

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.101
<i>Agent Sanderson
is very weak,</i>

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:09.506
<i>but he did let us know
that you've been helpful.</i>

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:13.342
<i>We checked and there's nobody
in the Kashalov family
named Armon Ranford.</i>

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.439
<i>Then obviously he used
a fake name with me.</i>

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:17.711
<i>We'll figure all
of that out eventually.</i>

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.616
<i>It's what we do.</i>

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:21.346
<i>So thank you
for your help, Molly,</i>

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.014
<i>but we're going
to take over from here.</i>

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.252
<i>No!</i>

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.793
<i>No. I started the job
and I'm going to finish it.</i>

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.864
<i>Miss Morris, with all due
respect, we're the FBI</i>

<i>and you're a young Pl

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.759
<i>Ms. Keller, do you
have Alex Patrone?</i>

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:39.931
<i>And "with all due respect,"
do you have the ledgers?</i>

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.872
<i>No.</i>

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.911
<i>He brought me hers
to find out who
the FBI mole was</i>

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:46.970
<i>to lead him to the ledgers
and for me to take the fall.</i>

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.548
<i>He thinks he got
two out of three.</i>

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.106
<i>He thinks he killed
Agent Sanderson</i>

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:51.947
<i>and I'm going to take
the blame for it.</i>

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.748
<i>But he doesn't
have the ledgers.
Nobody does.</i>

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.220
<i>Do you?</i>

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.881
<i>No, but I know
where they are.</i>

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.550
<i>He's waiting
for me to call him.</i>

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.719
<i>I can deliver him to you,
but he's smart.</i>

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.229
<i>He's going to throw
us a curve and we need
to anticipate that.</i>

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.458
<i>Why don't you let us
worry about that?</i>

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:09.127
<i>I'm telling you, if there's
one thing my experience
has taught me,</i>

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:11.068
<i>it's always have
a contingency.</i>

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:19.913
<i>Brook, what is going on?</i>

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:23.746
<i>What's platinum rule number one
in the Kappa chapter book?</i>

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.513
<i>Never wear sweatpants.</i>

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:27.246
<i>Rule number two?</i>

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.516
<i>A sister in need comes
before anything else.</i>

01:17:29.612 --> 01:17:32.957
<i>Girls, we have
a sister in need.</i>

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:41.135
<i>Molly, the second
he grabs the ledgers,</i>

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.136
<i>you need to get
on the ground quickly.</i>

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:45.934
<i>My roommate's freaked
about these.
They're due tomorrow.</i>

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.134
<i>It doesn't matter
that these aren't
the real ledgers.</i>

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:49.437
<i>I know.</i>

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.102
<i>Once he has them in hand,</i>

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.941
<i>we can get him
for obstruction.
Exactly.</i>

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.845
<i>From there, we can deal
with him to give up Alex.</i>

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:57.884
<i>{agent in distance}
Agent Keller...</i>

01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:00.453
<i>We're going to come in
fast and hard.</i>

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:04.348
<i>I found this on a pile
of Talloway's graded papers.</i>

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.456
<i>Don't tell anybody,
but I couldn't agree
with you more.</i>

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.897
<i>RICO was a complete
Nixon hustle.</i>

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:22.241
<i>{crowd noise}</i>

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:51.062
<i>Alpha One, do you have
a visual on Molly. Over.</i>

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.163
<i>We have her in our sights.</i>

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.904
<i>Alpha Two?
Affirmative.</i>

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.711
<i>{Armon}
Molly!</i>

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:07.549
<i>You look great.</i>

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:09.112
<i>Okay, this is it.
Be ready people.</i>

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:12.021
<i>Alex who?
Where's Alex?</i>

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.025
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.117
<i>Here.</i>

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.229
<i>I don't want those.</i>

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.428
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:24.129
<i>Excuse me. I actually have
to take this call.</i>

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:27.435
<i>Ow!
{agents yell}</i>

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:30.533
<i>That was a low portal
frequency jammer.</i>

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.307
<i>I used to be a fed.
Can you imagine that?</i>

01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:36.241
<i>Where'd they go?</i>

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.807
<i>Somebody give me
a location on Armon.</i>

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.078
<i>Alpha One,
do you have Molly?</i>

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.417
<i>Alpha Two?</i>

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:43.150
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:45.589
<i>they actually did teach us
how to detect lies.</i>

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:48.923
<i>Yeah, and obviously
how to tell them.
Totes.</i>

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:51.898
<i>I have to give it
to you, Morris.</i>

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.797
<i>You know how
to play the game.</i>

01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:59.499
<i>The ledgers.
What are these?</i>

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:02.405
<i>Kashalov never dealt
in widgets.</i>

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:03.909
<i>Where are
the real ledgers?</i>

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.912
<i>I don't know.
That's all I have.</i>

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.413
<i>Where are
the real ledgers?</i>

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.005
<i>I don't know.
That's all I have.</i>

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.084
<i>I'll take care
at both of you at once.</i>

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.484
<i>Brook! I found
the journal thingies
you were looking for.</i>

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.020
<i>Cotton, not now.</i>

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:17.784
<i>No, not now.
Like eight minutes ago.</i>

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:18.824
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:19.858
<i>Brook's dad.</i>

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.928
<i>Hi.</i>

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.430
<i>Princess, why don't
you introduce me
to your friend here?</i>

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:25.931
<i>This is Cotton.</i>

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:27.695
<i>You came all the way
from Hawaii?</i>

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:31.431
<i>Of course.
I'd go anywhere
for my little girl.</i>

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:34.599
<i>So where are
the journal thingies
you were talking about?</i>

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.937
<i>Are you okay, Brook?</i>

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.038
<i>You're looking at me all weird
like I'm being insipid
or something.</i>

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:43.616
<i>Where are the journal thingies
you were talking about,
Cinnamon?</i>

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.618
<i>It's Cotton.
It doesn't matter.</i>

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.153
<i>They're in the Chapter Room.</i>

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.620
<i>Thank you so much.
Nice meeting you.</i>

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.020
<i>You, too.</i>

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:01.158
<i>Don't worry about her.
She's a little sedated.</i>

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:03.703
<i>I need you to take me
to the Chapter Room.</i>

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.794
<i>See what kind
of skills you got.</i>

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:17.977
<i>Okay, Molly,
it's all going
according to plan.</i>

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.819
<i>You're doing great.
Alex is going to be fine.
Just stay calm.</i>

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.505
<i>This car is rigged.</i>

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.405
<i>If anyone tries
to get to Alex</i>

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:45.274
<i>I hit the trigger
on this phone
and the car explodes.</i>

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.005
<i>There's a bomb
under the car.</i>

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.605
<i>The keys are in his
jacket pocket. Go now!</i>

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.118
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.522
<i>{Nicholas}
Brook! We need to talk!</i>

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:00.685
<i>Oh, no.</i>

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.251
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:03.625
<i>A guy I'm dating.</i>

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:05.062
<i>You're dating this guy?</i>

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.394
<i>Wait a minute.
You're dating?</i>

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.025
<i>No not this guy!
Really?</i>

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.535
<i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.036
<i>Is he a student?</i>

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.470
<i>I can't talk
about this right now.</i>

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:14.097
<i>Why not?</i>

01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:15.698
<i>When do you have time
to date someone?</i>

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.300
<i>Where's the chapter
room, Molly?</i>

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.401
<i>Who the hell is Molly?
Hold on a second.</i>

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:21.106
<i>You handcuff me
to a radiator,</i>

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:22.876
<i>you bust me in the head,
then steal my bike.</i>

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.383
<i>It was nothing personal.</i>

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.283
<i>Wasn't personal?
You led me on!</i>

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.321
<i>You tricked me
into liking you,
then beat me down.</i>

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.822
<i>It's not a good--
You like me?</i>

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:33.621
<i>When this is all over,
I would like a proper
introduction.</i>

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.422
<i>Where the hell
is the Chapter Room?</i>

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:36.724
<i>It's right there!</i>

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.286
<i>Come on.</i>

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:40.756
<i>Where are
the ledgers, huh?</i>

01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:44.063
<i>{spraying sound}</i>

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:45.571
<i>Mace.
What is that?</i>

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.800
<i>No, it's not.
Yes, it is.</i>

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.001
<i>No, Nicholas.</i>

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:52.100
<i>What's your problem?</i>

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.306
<i>{yells}</i>

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:02.081
<i>What you got
Bonus Jonas? Bring it.</i>

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.624
<i>{shouting, crashing}</i>

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.670
<i>Bravo, but you know
all I have to do</i>

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.536
<i>is press nine on this thing</i>

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:24.372
<i>and that car blows up.</i>

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.946
<i>You're lying.
Am I?</i>

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.608
<i>Because you and I both know
how easy it is to make
a cocktail</i>

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.118
<i>out of nitrocellulose
and ketone, slide it
under the back seat.</i>

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.018
<i>You recognize
this phone, don't you?</i>

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:38.023
<i>It's outfitted
with the discontinued
6300 vibrator</i>

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.059
<i>that can send a signal.</i>

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:44.456
<i>Give me the gun.</i>

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.057
<i>Give me the gun!</i>

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:58.973
<i>You still want to see
if I'm bluffing
or not, don't you?</i>

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.069
<i>No.</i>

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:02.170
<i>Here we go.
No!</i>

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.555
<i>I don't think so.</i>

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:17.688
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:19.824
<i>I'm the contingency.</i>

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.272
<i>I think I got to sit down.</i>

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:28.340
<i>{groans}</i>

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.406
<i>{groans}</i>

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.446
<i>You're in big
trouble, Armon.</i>

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.344
<i>There's no boys allowed
in the chapter room.</i>

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.113
<i>Oh, everything's so pink.</i>

01:24:43.946 --> 01:24:46.392
<i>Alex!</i>

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.722
<i>Hey, Molly!</i>

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:49.353
<i>Oh, my God.
How did you--</i>

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.364
<i>Well, Sasha.</i>

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.421
<i>It's a disease.</i>

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:56.868
<i>Good klepto.</i>

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:58.097
<i>How'd I do?</i>

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:59.467
<i>You did great, Cotton.</i>

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.040
<i>{Armon}
Put me in, Coach!</i>

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.269
<i>No more of that
stinking root beer.</i>

01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:06.710
<i>Drop and give me 20, God.
Drop and give me 20!</i>

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.442
<i>The FBI's going to be here soon.
Why don't you go watch him?</i>

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:11.575
<i>{sirens approaching}</i>

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:18.650
<i>I need the ledgers
now, Alex.</i>

01:25:18.747 --> 01:25:19.782
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:31.070
<i>{Armon}
I want to go
to Candy Mountain,</i>

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.834
<i>and float on the tears
of unicorns.</i>

01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:35.931
<i>Are those real?</i>

01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:39.070
<i>I got the kill shot from here,
but I don't know if I can pay!</i>

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:43.139
<i>Maybe I put too much
basidiomycoda fungus
in the mace?</i>

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.514
<i>It's glorious.</i>

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:49.783
<i>Wait, maybe I wasn't supposed
to put basidiomycoda fungus
in the mace.</i>

01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:53.816
<i>{laughing, then crying}</i>

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:05.329
<i>You can turn that car
into a jungle gym
if you want, girls.</i>

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:06.770
<i>Knock yourself out.</i>

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.364
<i>I missed you.</i>

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:09.635
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:11.439
<i>I'm proud of you, too.</i>

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.343
<i>Well, I'm your father,
so let me be proud first.</i>

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:19.949
<i>Good work, Morris.
The FBI could use
someone like you.</i>

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:25.458
<i>Thank you, but I think
I'm going to stick around
here and go to college.</i>

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.960
<i>But my dad could use
some help getting back
on the force.</i>

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.324
<i>Molly.
What?</i>

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:31.489
<i>We'll see
what we can do.</i>

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.226
<i>Make it happen.</i>

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.629
<i>The ledgers.</i>

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.829
<i>The ledgers?</i>

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:38.997
<i>Consider it done, Morris.</i>

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:40.301
<i>Welcome back.</i>

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:41.705
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:43.333
<i>You're going to
be a cop again.</i>

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:44.900
<i>Brook.</i>

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:49.174
<i>Dad, this is Nicholas.</i>

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:52.049
<i>Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.</i>

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:53.985
<i>Who hit you?</i>

01:26:57.179 --> 01:26:58.157
<i>Your daughter.</i>

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.318
<i>Yeah, she did.</i>

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:04.728
<i>Yeah. I'm just going to leave
you guys to get to know
each other.</i>

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.925
<i>Hey, Brook.
It's Molly.</i>

01:27:07.022 --> 01:27:08.524
<i>I mean, Molly.
Come over here.</i>

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.501
<i>Wait, her name's Molly?</i>

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:13.403
<i>I'm a cop, Nicholas.
Just something
to think about.</i>

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:15.835
<i>I'm so proud of you guys.</i>

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.843
<i>OMG, we are
so bad ass.</i>

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.243
<i>I'm really happy
you're my sorority sister.</i>

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.837
<i>Me, too.</i>

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.405
<i>I hear some of those
Easy Alpha girls</i>

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:25.348
<i>have infiltrated
the Sorority Council.</i>

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.011
<i>How do we know
who they are?</i>

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.520
<i>We'll go undercover.</i>

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.784
<i>{all laugh}</i>

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:33.223
<i>{Cotton}
Wait, are we
with the FBI now?</i>

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:35.056
<i>Do we get a gun?</i>

01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:36.790
<i>Can I have a pink gun?</i>

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.482
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:05.789
<i>What're you
doing, Sherlock?</i>

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:07.451
<i>Cotton's dating this new guy</i>

01:28:07.549 --> 01:28:09.722
<i>so I told her I'd check
him out for her.</i>

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.561
<i>Ah, yes.
Nature photography.</i>

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:13.793
<i>So what's up
with this guy?</i>

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:15.459
<i>So far, so good.</i>

01:28:15.557 --> 01:28:17.559
<i>He's getting his PhD
in Quantum physics,</i>

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:21.096
<i>so they'll definitely be
on the same page
intellectually.</i>

01:28:21.163 --> 01:28:23.234
<i>That's cool for you
to do that for her,</i>

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:27.747
<i>because people often aren't
who they say they are,
you know?</i>

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.943
<i>They lie. Molly, they let
each other down.</i>

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.112
<i>How long are you
going to do this for?</i>

01:28:34.176 --> 01:28:36.122
<i>A couple of years.
Maybe ten.</i>

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:37.953
<i>Ten years.</i>

01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:40.357
<i>You're the detective.
Why don't you figure it out?</i>

01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:48.765
<i>This is getting
in the way.</i>

01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:08.186
<i>Let's go everybody.
Watch the lights, guys.</i>

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:09.880
<i>Ready, and background...</i>

01:29:09.978 --> 01:29:12.219
<i>I myself am
an Aikido man.</i>

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:14.191
<i>Aikido is a fashionable way
for fat housewives</i>

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:16.057
<i>to lose weight
at their local Equinox.</i>

01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:17.562
<i>Are you calling me
a fat housewife?</i>

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:18.460
<i>Yep.</i>

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.794
<i>Look...</i>

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:20.856
<i>I'm a fat housewife
in an--</i>

01:29:20.956 --> 01:29:22.867
<i>- Yes.
- Really?</i>

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:25.871
<i>And rolling.</i>

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:28.874
<i>{silly noises}</i>

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:31.808
<i>{evil crazy laugh}</i>

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.972
<i>Let's go guys.</i>

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.036
<i>Let's make a movie.</i>

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:36.410
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:37.812
<i>I'm not like
most girls.</i>

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.079
<i>Well, Brook
Stonebridge is--</i>

01:29:39.174 --> 01:29:40.482
<i>Who's Brook Stonebridge?</i>

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.681
<i>{laughing}</i>

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.157
<i>Set, and...</i>

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.993
<i>Sorry, but these
are so fucking spicy.</i>

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.590
<i>{coughs,
everyone laughs}</i>

01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:00.170
<i>That's an entrance!</i>

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:03.209
<i>I'll find out
if you're not.</i>

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.914
<i>{Miley screams
and runs}</i>

01:30:09.004 --> 01:30:11.848
<i>I'll find out
if you're not.</i>

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:13.284
<i>All right.</i>

01:30:16.211 --> 01:30:18.714
<i>{both crack up}</i>

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.525
<i>Still rolling,
and ready.</i>

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:26.031
<i>What am I doing?
For real?</i>

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:29.296
<i>Dude. Wait.
Now what do you want
me to do?</i>

01:30:29.391 --> 01:30:30.870
<i>Jump off the side?</i>

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:32.769
<i>-Me.
What am I doing?</i>

01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:34.238
<i>Ju-jit-su.</i>

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:36.207
<i>You're well-versed
in ju-jit-su.</i>

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.971
<i>You heard of the--</i>

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:43.709
<i>{nonsense babble}
Ju-jit-su.</i>

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:47.117
<i>If that ends up
anywhere,
I'm going to kill you.</i>

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:51.315
<i>I'm like,
totally undercover.</i>

01:30:51.413 --> 01:30:53.893
<i>I'm like,
so undercover.</i>

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.828
<i>I'm so undercover.</i>

01:30:57.305 --> 01:31:03.172
