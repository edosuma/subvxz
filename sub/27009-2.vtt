Of course!

01:10.571 --> 01:11.905
It's a cool idea!

01:11.989 --> 01:13.991
I'd totally buy one, Mom.

<i>I am about to give birth to your baby!</i>

19:30.711 --> 19:32.380
<i>You're right. I'm so sorry.</i>

19:32.963 --> 19:35.091
<i>-I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you, too.</i>

<i>-Stick that landing!</i>

19:43.265 --> 19:45.017
<i>Oh, I'm gonna crash!</i>

19:47.228 --> 19:49.355
<i>Maureen? Maureen!</i>

19:49.438 --> 19:53.734
<i>Bill, you were supposed to watch me,</i>
<i>but now I'm dead!</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:56.570
[screams]

19:56.654 --> 19:58.030
Holy shit!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.159
Maureen?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.120
Are you okay in there?

20:04.578 --> 20:05.871
Maureen?

20:05.955 --> 20:08.290
Maureen? Say something!

20:08.374 --> 20:09.834
God damn it.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.174
There you are.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.968
Maureen, you scared me half to--

20:24.849 --> 20:26.267
[screams]

20:26.350 --> 20:27.393
[screams]

20:27.476 --> 20:28.686
[cat snarls]

20:29.979 --> 20:31.188
What the hell are you doing?

20:31.272 --> 20:32.857
-What are you doing?
-Reading!

20:32.940 --> 20:34.859
[woman] Help! Police!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.068
Oh, shit!

20:36.610 --> 20:39.321
Our name is Jimmy Fitzsimmons!

20:39.405 --> 20:40.489
-[woman] Oh, God!
-[cat meows]

20:40.573 --> 20:42.283
[Frank] I feel
like I'm living on shifting sand.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.200
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

20:43.784 --> 20:45.494
This kid will be here before I know it,

20:45.578 --> 20:47.455
and I have no fucking idea
where to put it.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.667
I already got one baby in the basement.
Where's this one going? On the roof?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.587
Just build a new room on the back
of your house for the baby.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.466
Chet, I gave my son three-year-old candy
with a tooth in it to save a few bucks.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.135
Does it sound
like I can afford a contractor?

21:01.218 --> 21:03.012
Contractor? They're all crooks.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.513
Do it yourself! I'll help.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.473
You would do that?

21:05.556 --> 21:08.476
Sure. I built
a bunch of orphanages in Vietnam.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.187
God knows, I did
enough shit over there to fill them up.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.314
My God, Chet, thanks.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.150
Oh, that'll make
Sue feel so much better--

21:16.233 --> 21:18.194
Oh, shit, I forgot her pizza!

21:19.570 --> 21:22.865
Uh, give me a Silver Screen
Sensational Sausage Pizza

21:22.948 --> 21:24.533
and a Dinosaur Gulp of Rusty Cola.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.787
Oh, you missed the cutoff.
We close at 10:00.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.954
Listen, kid.

21:29.038 --> 21:32.249
You may not understand this now,
but when you get married you will.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.879
I left to get my wife a pizza an hour ago,
but I stopped to drink and smoke.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.341
If I go back to that car empty-handed,
I'll be a dead man.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.219
Sorry, but I don't make the rules.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.888
Oh, for Christ sakes,
she's gonna have my ass.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.350
All right, Colonel. Take it easy.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.267
Colonel?

21:50.351 --> 21:51.936
Please, he's just a boy.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.437
-Don't kill him.
-Kill me?

21:53.521 --> 21:55.898
Son, you don't know
how close you just came

21:55.981 --> 21:58.651
to having your nutsack
stapled to your forehead.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.862
That is Colonel Frank Murphy.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.281
Rhymes with mercy, but he has none.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.200
And he is an American hero.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.912
He once flew his burning F-4
with two broken legs and charred hands

22:09.995 --> 22:13.082
and steered it with his manhood
because mayhem turns him on.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.794
You do not want this man as an enemy.
Or a lover.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.965
Colonel Murphy has done things
he'll never be able to undo.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.926
He has seen things he can never unsee.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.512
Do you know he hasn't had
an emotional connection

22:26.595 --> 22:28.556
with another human being in two decades?

22:29.098 --> 22:33.102
But the other day, the mere sight
of a kitten walking along a fence

22:33.185 --> 22:35.020
caused him to burst into tears?

22:35.688 --> 22:38.190
Did you know that at night
he sits in his backyard

22:38.274 --> 22:42.778
staring at the tree line,
silently whispering, "Here I am, Charlie.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.157
Make it my last night.
Make it my last night."

22:48.534 --> 22:49.869
[sniffles]

22:49.952 --> 22:51.662
And why has he done all of this?

22:52.121 --> 22:55.332
All so young men like you
could live a full life,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.460
with a fast car and a sweet piece of ass,

22:58.878 --> 23:02.715
never knowing what it's like
to stir a hot pot of Army rations

23:02.798 --> 23:04.300
with a discarded femur.

23:04.383 --> 23:08.220
-["Battle Hymn of the Republic" playing]
-So if you respect this man's sacrifice,

23:08.304 --> 23:14.643
you will make him a Silver Screen...
Sensational... Sausage... Pizza!

23:16.061 --> 23:17.521
Thank you, Colonel Murphy.

23:19.356 --> 23:22.902
Cover your bits, boys.
Microwave's going hot.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.238
[machine whirs]

23:28.908 --> 23:30.159
She stole it from me.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.328
Just stole it.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.749
And I rushed my follow-up
and made a fool of myself at the parade.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.877
And now I've got a baby on the way,

23:39.960 --> 23:42.338
and my husband means well,
but he's no help.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.591
It feels
like I'll never accomplish anything.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.845
You just can't understand
how hopeless my life is.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.643
I remember birds in trees got quiet.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.145
I hear mother scream.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.064
Then everything go white.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.107
Then everything black.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.360
Then everything flames.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.236
Then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.448
I look for father, but he's not there.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.033
Nobody there.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.370
Then think, "Why I still here?"

24:15.579 --> 24:17.831
Still think that every day.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.962
But your Salad Tosser story is sad, too.

24:23.045 --> 24:27.424
[whining] Oh, my God, look at me,
going on about my stupid life.

24:27.716 --> 24:31.220
I've got it good.
I'm so selfish and spoiled and--

24:31.845 --> 24:34.515
Oh, my God and I'm still
talking about myself. [gasps]

24:34.598 --> 24:36.475
-I am so sorry.
-It's okay.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.310
Water under bridge...

24:38.852 --> 24:41.063
Like typhoon that took grandfather.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.356
Oh, fuck.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.942
You're so weird.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.194
What were you doing in there?

24:47.569 --> 24:51.615
I just wanted some place to read
my magazine without Dad taking it away.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.534
He's always yelling about it.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.703
He's always yelling about everything.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.081
Do you think our family is normal?

24:59.790 --> 25:00.791
No.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.837
And it's not gonna get any better
when the baby comes.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.505
[groans]

25:06.588 --> 25:07.715
We'll get through it.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.259
Us middle kids got to stick together.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.595
What about Kevin?

25:13.679 --> 25:14.680
Fuck him.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.109
Thank you, honey.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.153
This turned out to be a great night.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.487
You deserved a break.

25:34.116 --> 25:37.036
Hey. Wake up and go to bed,
you little shit.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.246
Chet, I can't thank you enough.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.832
If you really want to thank me,
don't thank me.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.418
And I mean it
about building that addition for you.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.005
If those war-hating Amish pussies
in silly beards and horse buggies

25:48.088 --> 25:49.423
can raise a barn on a Sunday,

25:49.506 --> 25:53.093
hey, hey, we can sure as shit
build a kid's room by Halloween.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.720
Cheers, buddy.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.974
Frank look at Chet
like Mr. Whipple look at Charmin.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.561
Nguyen-Nguyen, you really helped me
put things in perspective.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.439
The pity party is over.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.857
And I'm not giving up.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.526
I'll have another idea,
and that one's gonna hit.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.153
I don't care what Vivian says.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.279
Good for you.

26:12.988 --> 26:13.864
Who Vivian?

26:13.947 --> 26:15.449
Exactly.

26:27.419 --> 26:31.465
I don't need those fucking dildos
and their shit music anyway.
