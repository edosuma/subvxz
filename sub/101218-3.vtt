00:00.400 --> 00:02.460
- I have to go to Cambridge,
my dad's taken ill.

00:02.560 --> 00:03.580
- Oh Jesus, what's happened?

00:03.680 --> 00:04.780
- [Michael] I'm Hugh Callaghan's son.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.060
The doctor said he had a visitor.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.460
- Yes.
- Who was it?

00:07.560 --> 00:09.140
- [Nurse] Your wife.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.580
- [Matthew] Oh, my god.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.940
- [Cloda] I understand
you might wanna talk.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.420
Bad things happen here.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.460
She's not the first, and
she won't be the last.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.500
- It's a girl.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.820
- [Mary] Didn't I tell you it was a girl?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.400
- [Michael] You're the one going around
impersonating my dead wife.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.500
- That's not what that was.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.820
(dramatic music)

00:26.920 --> 00:28.920
- It's not safe here.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.400
(somber music)

01:03.320 --> 01:05.920
(gentle music)

01:09.040 --> 01:10.460
- I'm a wee bit nervous.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.560
- [Michael] Don't be.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.140
- Well?

01:15.240 --> 01:16.220
Come on, what do you think?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.320
- Hmm.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.840
(Roisin sighs)

01:24.240 --> 01:26.240
- [Roisin] What's that?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
- Open it.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.240
I can't wait to see you in it.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.640
- My god, it's beautiful.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.660
I'm not sure it's right for...

01:53.760 --> 01:56.680
(zipper unzipping)

01:58.320 --> 02:00.400
- Let me give you a hand.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.520
I love you.
- I love you.

02:35.640 --> 02:36.380
God, I love you so much.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.820
(Michael moaning)

02:39.920 --> 02:41.620
(knocking on door)

02:41.720 --> 02:43.860
- Oh shit, shit. They're here.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.960
Oh shit, go, go.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.540
(laughing) Come here.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.100
- Lovely to see you. (laughing)

02:53.200 --> 02:55.200
- Hello.
- Hi, Ruth.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.940
(Michael sighing)

03:27.040 --> 03:28.100
- Beautiful.
(Matthew chuckling)

03:28.200 --> 03:30.240
- You'll break my heart with your playing.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.740
Ruth, can I have one of your cigs?

03:33.840 --> 03:35.340
- Yeah, course.
- Mm-hmm.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.340
- Oh, my god. (chuckling)

03:37.440 --> 03:39.180
Matthew, look.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.060
Come here.
- (laughing) Congratulations.

03:42.160 --> 03:42.900
- I knew it.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.840
What did I tell you? I knew it.
- It's the beginning of the end, Michael.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.100
Next thing there'll be a baby.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.140
- I don't think so.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.620
- Someone Roisin might
worship more than Michael?

03:51.720 --> 03:52.780
How would he cope?

03:52.880 --> 03:55.580
- You're right, of course. I
could never possibly share her.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.300
(Roisin giggles)

03:58.400 --> 04:01.480
(gentle piano music)

04:08.080 --> 04:09.660
- Matthew.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.760
- It's fantastic news.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.080
- Aye, it'll be some craic, the wedding.
- Yeah, I promise to keep it together.

04:16.160 --> 04:16.900
- What do you mean?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
- It's sort of sad for
me at the same time.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.680
I always loved you.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.900
But it's not like I ever thought

04:26.000 --> 04:26.980
I could do anything about it.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.240
It's just, you know,
there, in the background.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.140
I've said it now.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.240
Forget it. It's been said.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.700
- I'll see you in the morning.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.800
- Yeah. Night.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.880
(gentle choir music)

05:12.160 --> 05:14.140
- I need to speak to you, Matthew.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.240
- One minute, boys.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.900
What is it? I'm in the
middle of choir practice.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.580
- I've been suspended.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.420
- What?

05:22.520 --> 05:23.820
- The bastard's had me suspended.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.660
- Who?

05:24.760 --> 05:26.580
- For god's sake, Michael, who else?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.620
- I'm sure he didn't think
it would go this far.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.340
- When are you gonna see
that man for what he is?

05:31.440 --> 05:32.900
A manipulative, lying-

05:33.000 --> 05:33.780
- He's not lying, though, is he?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.980
You did visit his father.
You pretended to be his wife.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.340
- My best friend had just died.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.540
I had questions. I still do.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.500
I mean, don't you find it at all strange?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.140
- It was an accident.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.340
- What was she doing over there?

05:45.440 --> 05:46.820
She didn't tell me she was leaving.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.880
- [Matthew] Why should
she have to tell you?

05:47.960 --> 05:49.700
- Because she was scared.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.220
You remember how jealous he was of her?

05:51.320 --> 05:53.740
He couldn't stomach her
success, he hated it.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.500
And he punished her.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.780
What about that girl?
- What girl?

05:56.880 --> 05:57.940
- He was seeing a girl.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.500
I saw them together. She's a student.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.140
Where is he now? Is he still in Ireland?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.420
- I'm not sure.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.100
- Oh, my god, you're
actually covering for him.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.980
It's disgusting, it's pathetic.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.620
- I just don't think you
should be chasing him around.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.800
- You're still just a besotted
young man with a crush.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.540
- Ruth, what's got into you?

06:19.640 --> 06:21.980
- He's not a good man,
your precious Michael.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.340
He's a narcissist and a bully.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.440
- I need to get back to the boys.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.040
- Well, he won't bully me.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.580
- Sure a fire like that

06:31.680 --> 06:32.940
affects the whole structure of the house,

06:33.040 --> 06:35.080
the electrics and everything.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.940
It's madness us all moving back in here

06:38.040 --> 06:39.420
before it's been fixed.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.060
I'm supposed to be recovering.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.100
Maybe just my luck,

06:42.200 --> 06:43.860
if they give me the all clear
and then the roof falls on me.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.900
- There was a such a noise, though, Hugh,

06:47.000 --> 06:48.460
in the wall by the bath,

06:48.560 --> 06:51.580
like a water pipe being tied in a knot.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.460
- You think there's
something strange going on?

06:53.560 --> 06:55.500
- Who knows.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.900
This place, sometimes I
feel like I'm going mad.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.220
- What is it, love?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.180
You can tell me.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.620
- I had a lady come to
the house to do a reading.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.580
- A reading?

07:06.680 --> 07:08.100
- She's a local woman, Cloda.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.580
- Uh-huh.
- You know her?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.460
- [Hugh] I've known her
since she was a wain.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.180
- Well, she told me this place is haunted.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.280
- (chuckling) Well, I could
have told you that, girl.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.620
We've never been alone
here, not for generations.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.220
There's a wee girl in the
village. What's her name?

07:23.320 --> 07:25.100
She'll tell you. Cloda.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.020
- [Ophelia] Cloda?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.620
- Aye.
- Yes, Hugh,

07:27.720 --> 07:28.820
I was just telling you.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.500
- Poor Roisin, how she suffered.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.980
I told Michael he'd never escape it.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.420
And it was his doing.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.260
- What was his doing?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.380
- That's why he's trying
to sell the house.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.480
The guilt, you see.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.700
There's a girl in Knockdara.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.060
She does readings.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.180
She'll tell you.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.380
What's her name?

07:46.480 --> 07:48.260
- Cloda.
- Aye, you know her?

07:48.360 --> 07:49.340
- Yes, Hugh.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.980
I'm sorry, I know it's confusing.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.020
But please try, please try and explain.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.220
- Explain what?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.180
- Oh, Michael will know.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.540
What's the name of your woman?

07:57.640 --> 07:59.220
- Who?
- He means me, I think.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.700
- Ah, the glass cut her, you know.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.940
- I know, Dad.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.220
It's all right. Everything's fine.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.860
How are you feeling now? You okay?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.960
- Yeah, much better, thanks.
- Sure?

08:09.440 --> 08:12.380
- I've told you, Son, this
place is a death trap.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.800
We shouldn't be here.
- I know, Dad, I know.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.580
Right, I need to go and
meet this publisher.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.940
Will you two look after each other?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.740
- [Hugh] I'm gonna sit by the fire.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.100
- Who is it you're meeting?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.300
- Roisin's publisher, about
the rights to her estate,

08:27.400 --> 08:28.340
her books, all that.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.460
I told you, remember?

08:30.560 --> 08:31.480
It's just in the cafe in the village.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.140
- But we were saying
that was why I was here,

08:34.240 --> 08:35.020
because of her books.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.020
- There's no keeping
secrets here, Ophelia,

08:37.120 --> 08:38.940
not in this place.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.900
Everyone knows about us.
- Everyone?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
- Well, Mary knows, everyone knows.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.140
Hey, it's all right.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.180
The people in this place
they look after their own,

08:47.280 --> 08:51.460
and in the end that means me, not Roisin.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.560
We don't have to lie anymore.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I won't be long.

09:04.680 --> 09:09.680
(phone line trilling)
(phone ringing)

09:15.280 --> 09:17.340
(notification chimes)

09:17.440 --> 09:20.440
(suspenseful music)

09:22.320 --> 09:24.380
- [Matthew] Michael, it's
me, can you call me back?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.420
Ruth just came to see me,

09:25.520 --> 09:27.740
ranting about some girl
she thinks you're seeing.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.900
I know there's nothing in it, I know that,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.020
it's just she's going to cause trouble.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.800
Just call me. I need
to know the line, okay?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.700
- [Sean] You all right?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.060
- Sean, I have to run out.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.100
Michael left his phone.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.020
Will you keep an eye on Hugh?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.060
He's in the living room.
- Aye, no bother.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.160
- [Ophelia] Thank you.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.420
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.560
- [Cloda] My wee boy's
just having his song.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.360
- Here, I'm sorry about the other day.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.980

10:44.440 --> 10:48.100

The other poor girl too.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.020
Just open your heart, and they'll come.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.120
- The other girl?

10:54.800 --> 10:57.220

Hello?

12:03.560 --> 12:04.900
I'm sorry to disturb you.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.420
Are you here to meet Michael?

12:06.520 --> 12:08.060
- Ach, naw, I'm waiting on Seamus.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.780
You wouldn't know where he is, now?

12:26.520 --> 12:27.660
- Don't you be worrying about that.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.760
- Please, I insist.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.480
What was it?

12:32.840 --> 12:33.580
(Ophelia groans)

12:33.680 --> 12:35.680
- Are you all right?

12:36.800 --> 12:38.800
Here.
- What the fuck?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.300
- Hey, take it easy.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.500
- No, you don't understand.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
I didn't put it there.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.780
Michael.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.880
Michael!

13:06.080 --> 13:06.840
- Ophelia, what the hell are you doing?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.760
- Why didn't you stop?
- But I did.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.500
Jesus, what did you do to your hand?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.680
- There was a knife in my bag.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
- What?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.560
Okay, come on, we'll get you sorted.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.900
- [Porter] Dr. Callaghan
is on compassionate leave.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
- Do you know where I can find him?
- I'm afraid I couldn't say, sir.

13:31.080 --> 13:31.820
- Ah, you couldn't say?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
All right, thanks for your help.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.900
- Excuse me?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Hi, sorry.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.100
You're looking for Michael Callaghan?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.420
- Yeah, do you know him?
- Yes.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.260
What's this about?

13:50.360 --> 13:53.240
- [Richard] Her name's Annabelle
Lorimer. She's missing.

13:55.120 --> 13:55.860
- Is she a student?

13:55.960 --> 13:56.740
- She was. She left last year.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.140
- But I saw her here a few weeks ago.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.860
She was talking to him, to Michael.

14:01.960 --> 14:02.980
- She had his address in her diary.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.780
- His home address? Why?

14:04.880 --> 14:07.220
- [Richard] That's what
I'm trying to find out.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.140
- Did he teach her?

14:08.240 --> 14:09.580
- Nobody will tell me.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.500
And I don't know where he
is or how to contact him.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.580
(somber music)

14:14.680 --> 14:15.400
- [Ophelia] Michael, what's going on?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.580
- What's that?
- Your phone.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.420
You left it at the house,
that's why I came after you.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.260
- What about it?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.780
- I was at the church and it rang.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.140
- Yeah?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.940
- It said it was Roisin.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.500
(tires screeching)
(emergency brake clicking)

14:29.600 --> 14:30.580
- What is this, Ophelia?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.260
- I just want you to be honest with me.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.000
- You're seeing visions of her,
you think she's calling my phone.

14:35.080 --> 14:35.860
This has to stop.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.020
What are you trying to do to me?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.780
- I feel like I'm losing my mind.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.880
- Here, call it.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.740
- I don't want to.
- Do it.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.420
(Ophelia sighing)

14:46.520 --> 14:49.680
(phone line trilling)

14:53.480 --> 14:55.940
- [Mary] Michael? I've
been trying to call you.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.040
Hello?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.740
- Mary has her old phone.
- Right.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.060
- Ophelia, what is going on?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.700
What is it that you
think is happening here?

15:03.800 --> 15:06.260
- Perhaps I'd be less paranoid
if you told me the truth.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.320
- [Michael] What are you talking about?
- You said you had a meeting at the cafe,

15:08.400 --> 15:09.460
but where were you?

15:09.560 --> 15:13.040
Why would you lie to me?
- Jesus! (sighs)

15:14.400 --> 15:16.540
Fine, yeah. Okay, listen.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.820
I went into the village and
met Paul about the house sale.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.140
I didn't wanna say in front of my dad

15:21.240 --> 15:22.660
because it upsets him, that's all.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.620
- And there was a message on
it from Matthew about Ruth.

15:25.720 --> 15:29.120
She definitely knows about us.
- So what if she does? We're together now.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.860
- And you said everything would be fine,

15:30.960 --> 15:33.100
but everyone was staring at
me in the cafe, in the pub.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.140
- I know.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.240
I know and I'm sorry.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.680
(sighs) You shouldn't have
been dragged into all this.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.020
When I see how you've handled
everything, you're so strong.

15:49.120 --> 15:49.940
- I don't feel it.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.600
(somber music)

15:57.520 --> 15:59.660
- You're stronger than I could ever be.

15:59.760 --> 16:04.780
I just need to tie up
everything here, and when I do,

16:04.880 --> 16:09.880
then you and I can go back to
Cambridge, properly, together.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
- I'd love that.
- Yeah?

16:16.720 --> 16:21.560
- [Ophelia] I'd love that more
than anything in the world.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.900
- Go upstairs. I'll come up in a minute.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.240
(woman humming)

17:33.160 --> 17:34.420
- Ah, you're back.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.420
Michael with you?

17:35.520 --> 17:39.440
- No, I mean, yes, he's downstairs.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.500
Mary, what are you doing?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.880
- I'm just trying to
sort out Roisin's things.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.100
This was mine, you know?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.200
Course, they had to add some lace.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.760
She was a good bit taller than me.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.640
Come and sit down just for a minute.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.740
How are you feeling?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.380
Hugh told me about your
scare in the bathroom.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.820
- I'm fine.
- It can't be easy, all this.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.540
I do understand, you know?

18:17.640 --> 18:19.680
- You do?
- Well, it's not your fault.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.400
I'm not naive.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.720
I know how it can happen.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.840
But things are still
very raw for everyone.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.180
Why don't you just go home, love?

18:36.280 --> 18:39.160
Maybe it'll work out in time, but not now.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.080
You need to let him grieve.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.060
- [Michael] Here you are.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.180
- Aye, you need to drink plenty of that.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.420
Good for the wee baby. (chuckling)

18:50.520 --> 18:53.020
- Are you done here?
- Aye, for now.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.020
Will you lift me to the shop?
- Aye, no problem.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.020
- I promised Hugh I'd make
you all dinner tonight.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.120
I just need to grab a few bits.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.400
(wind whistling)

19:11.240 --> 19:13.240
- You'll be all right, won't you?

19:13.640 --> 19:15.640
- Yeah, of course.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.720
- Yeah.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.900
(Ophelia sighs)

19:31.000 --> 19:33.140
- Ugh.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.020
- People don't like
the idea of living here

19:35.120 --> 19:38.140
after what happened, Dad, but
I spoke to Paul this morning,

19:38.240 --> 19:39.580
and apparently he's been approached

19:39.680 --> 19:41.220
by some property developers

19:41.320 --> 19:43.260
who are very interested in the land.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.700
- What do you mean, the land?

19:44.800 --> 19:46.580
- It's a company that owns
a group of country hotels.

19:46.680 --> 19:51.400
Basically, look, it would just mean
that we'll save on finishing renovations.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.580
We could buy somewhere new, more compact,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.140
up the coast, perhaps.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.860
- Over my dead body.

19:56.960 --> 19:57.940
- Ah, there you are, love.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.060
Sit down, I'll get you your food.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.380
- Hey, how are you feeling?

20:01.480 --> 20:02.860
- Better, thanks.
- Okay.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.580
- You've no respect.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.180
- I'm sorry?
- Not you, it's all right.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.340
- My grandfather built this house.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.580
- It was just an idea, Dad.
- Thank you.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.140
- I made yours specially.

20:12.240 --> 20:12.940
- You know, Michael,

20:13.040 --> 20:14.420
there are lots of things I don't remember.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.700
But most of what I do remember
happened in this house.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.100
This is our home, for God's sake.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.420
- I know, Dad, I know.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.660
You don't have to keep going on.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.300
Next you'll be telling us about Bridget.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.140
- [Mary] Who's Bridget?

20:27.240 --> 20:28.160
- [Michael] What, he
hasn't told you this story?

20:28.240 --> 20:28.980
- Don't think so.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.460
- You winding me up now, son?
- Absolutely not.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.660
Please, go on.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.760
Mary, can you pass me the wine?

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
It's a good one.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.540
- It was 1949, the year
the Republic was declared.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.640
I was seven years old.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.840
My old da got a job in
Liverpool to build a new school.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.940
Well, he was to be gone for
around six months, on and off,

20:52.040 --> 20:56.180
so he needed someone to
look after the garden

20:56.280 --> 20:57.540
and keep an eye on things.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.880
There was this fella named McGinley.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.780
He lived in that house just
before the village there,

21:04.880 --> 21:05.620
you know the one I mean?

21:05.720 --> 21:07.460
- Yes, Dad.
- McGinley, he comes here

21:07.560 --> 21:10.900
every day first thing, and
then on around the third day,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.260
his daughter comes with him.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.500
She comes straight into my
room and introduces herself.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.820
This was Bridget.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.340
She was a wee bit older than me,

21:18.440 --> 21:20.020
not much, maybe a year or so.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.660
And she'd look at me like I
was the silliest little boy,

21:22.760 --> 21:26.620
but by God I was mad about her.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.820
All day, we'd play
hide-and-seek around the house

21:29.920 --> 21:31.580
and by the trees outside.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.820
For weeks we were inseparable.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.300
My da's job in Liverpool
finished, he came home.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.340
McGinley stopped coming
and so did Bridget.

21:41.440 --> 21:45.380
Weeks passed, then one day
I was playing in the woods

21:45.480 --> 21:47.660
and out of nowhere, there she was.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.620
She told me that her ma and da

21:49.720 --> 21:51.460
wouldn't let her play with me anymore,

21:51.560 --> 21:54.420
but we could meet in secret.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.860
So we had an arrangement.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.420
I gave her the key to the wee summer house

21:57.520 --> 21:59.520
at the bottom of the garden.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.740
She would wait until her
ma and da had gone to bed

22:02.840 --> 22:04.700
and then she'd sneak out.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.620
(solemn music)

22:06.720 --> 22:08.620
She'd go to the summer house

22:08.720 --> 22:10.820
and she'd flick the switch on and off,

22:10.920 --> 22:12.700
and I would watch from my bedroom window.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.700
Whenever I saw it, I'd go down to her.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.920
And then, one night in
February, she didn't come.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.260
I was heartbroken.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.700
Well, the next morning,
I looked out of my window

22:21.800 --> 22:25.020
and there she was in the
drive beside the trees.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.660
So I pulled on my shoes
and rushed outside,

22:27.760 --> 22:30.140
still in my pajamas, I was
that desperate to see her.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.640
But as soon as I got out the front door,

22:34.160 --> 22:37.240
she ran off up the drive
and out into the road.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.180
Well, I chased after her
almost to the village.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.580
But when she got to the church,

22:42.680 --> 22:44.100
she turned into the graveyard,

22:44.200 --> 22:46.700
and I watched her rush across
to one of the gravestones

22:46.800 --> 22:47.900
and hide behind it.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
But when I got there, she was gone.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.280
Hmm, gone.

22:59.160 --> 23:03.740
The gravestone was small,
like it was for a child.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.160
And it was old and grown over.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
And I looked at the writing.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.560
"Here lies Bridget McGinley.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.960
Born May 1938.

23:18.040 --> 23:22.280
Died March 1945."

23:23.520 --> 23:25.300
Four years before I'd met her.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.400
- Oh, god.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.180
- [Hugh] Sitting on the
grass beneath the gravestone

23:30.280 --> 23:33.140
was the little key that I'd
given her to the summer house.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.020
- Christ, Hugh, why would
you tell a tale like that?

23:36.120 --> 23:38.420
- I went to my mother and
I asked about Bridget,

23:38.520 --> 23:39.260
and she told me

23:39.360 --> 23:41.300
that when the McGinleys
first came to Knockdara,

23:41.400 --> 23:46.400
they did have a daughter, but
she died a few months after.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.760
And then it dawned on me, no
one ever spoke to Bridget.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.240
Not my mother, not her father, no one.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.320
Only me.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.380
- It's a good story, Dad.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.220
- Aye, Michael's too clever
to believe any of it.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.820
An explanation for everything, my son has.

24:11.920 --> 24:15.060
But I knew Bridget. She was my friend.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.160
You should ask your woman.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.260
- Who?
- Your one,

24:18.360 --> 24:19.700
your one from the village.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.800
What's her name? She was here.

24:22.160 --> 24:22.900
- Cloda.
- Cloda?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.900
- [Hugh] Aye, that's her.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.380
- Sheila's friend?
- I do not believe this.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.220
- What?

24:28.320 --> 24:29.040
- You're in this house five minutes

24:29.120 --> 24:30.940
and you have that woman here,
spreading her wickedness?

24:31.040 --> 24:32.820
- I was scared. I've seen things.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.300
I've heard things.
- Superstitious nonsense.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
- Oh, my god.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.480
Are you mad?

24:44.840 --> 24:46.840
What's this?
- It's the holy water.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.420
- And what's it for?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.220
- Stop waving that about.
It's to bless the house.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.140
- So that's okay, is it?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.260
To believe that, but nothing else?

24:54.360 --> 24:56.940
No, on everything else,
you're entirely rational.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.180
You tell me there are no
ghosts, that it's in my head,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.180
but you think sprinkling that water around

25:01.280 --> 25:03.580
is gonna protect you from the devil?

25:03.680 --> 25:05.300
- It's a good point.
- That's different.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.520
- Come on, Mary, you're gonna
have to do better than that.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.980
- Well, you would take her side.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.300
- I'm not taking her side.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.700
In any case, I think you're all wrong.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.500
There's not the slightest
reason to believe any of this.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.500
There are no ghosts.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.460
Dad made up a nice story
about his wee friend,

25:15.560 --> 25:16.420
and that's just tap water,

25:16.520 --> 25:18.260
no matter how much you paid
Father William to bless it.

25:18.360 --> 25:19.940
- You watch your mouth, Son.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.580
You'll not be forgiven.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.700
Not for all the water in the Irish Sea.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.260
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Roisin.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.420
Ask him, Bridget, ask him to tell you.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.580
- Hugh, it's all right.
- Dad, please.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.260
- Roisin did it to herself, Michael.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.100
- No, Dad.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.460
- She did it to herself because of you,

25:38.560 --> 25:42.180
because of all your aul
carry on behind her back.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.420
That girl loved you.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.620
- That's not true, Hugh.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.660
It was an accident.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.860
- God forgive you, Son.

25:47.960 --> 25:48.980
May God forgive you!

25:49.080 --> 25:50.620
- Dad, this is serious now.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.580
You're gonna make yourself ill again.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.620
- Don't you tell me what to do.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.720
I'm your father.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
- Come on.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.320
Please.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.520
- You haven't touched your food, dear.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
- I brought you some tea.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.360
- I don't want it.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.020
- What?
- It's disgusting.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.340
I'm sick of the stuff. What even is it?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.560
- It's good for you.
- You drink it then.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.900
- So you had Cloda here?
- Yes.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.540
- And why would you do that?

27:00.640 --> 27:02.060
- I don't know, I thought it might help.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.300
- She's a charlatan.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.020
- Has anyone else died here?
- What?

27:06.120 --> 27:08.360
- [Ophelia] In this house,
before the fire, I mean.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.020
- Of course. It's an old house.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.220
My grandparents lived here.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.100
My great grandparents lived here.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.200
- She talked about a girl.

27:16.960 --> 27:17.860
Was that Bridget?
(Michael sighs)

27:17.960 --> 27:20.140
- Come on, Ophelia, this
isn't gonna help you.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.900
That girl, Cloda, what happened to her,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.820
what happened to her son, it's awful.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.340
And since then, she's
been scrabbling around,

27:25.440 --> 27:28.700
trying to make sense of it,
but it's not your concern.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
And you shouldn't be encouraging her.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.320
Go to sleep now.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.400
Mm, delicious.

27:47.800 --> 27:48.540
- Are you getting in?

27:48.640 --> 27:50.720
- Aye, I'll be up in a bit.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.220
- Michael?
- Yeah.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.340
- That story your dad told, is it true?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
- What do you think?

28:01.120 --> 28:03.100
Get some sleep.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.800
(somber music)

28:50.320 --> 28:52.380
Morning, Da.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.480
I brought you your coffee.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.580
You have been dreaming
about your darling, Bridget,

28:56.680 --> 28:58.680
no doubt.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.960
I swear that story gets better
and better every time you...

29:05.040 --> 29:07.600
(solemn music)

29:11.680 --> 29:13.680
Dad?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.720
Dad.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.280
Mary.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.100
Mary!

29:46.200 --> 29:47.780
- [Mary] Michael? What is it?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.300
- [Michael] He's not breathing.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.540
- Hugh?
- He's not breathing.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.740
- Help me turn him.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.660
Help me get him on his back.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.460
Hugh, it's Mary.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.720
You listen to me now,
you wake up, you hear me?

30:00.840 --> 30:02.840
- Dad.
- Hugh.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.820
- [Michael] The last
words he said to me, Mary-

30:37.920 --> 30:40.160
- None of that matters now.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.300
He loved you more than
anything else in the world.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.660
Difficult aul bastard that he was.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.900
(both chuckling)

30:48.000 --> 30:50.920
(knocking on door)

30:57.120 --> 30:59.880
Ach, Sean, what about
you? Thanks for coming.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.060
- I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.380
I was up in Fahan on a job.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.480
- Come through, now.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
- Michael, I'm so sorry.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.560
And after Roisin.
(Michael sighs)

31:21.840 --> 31:25.480
- "When sorrows come, they
come not single spies,

31:27.800 --> 31:32.800
but in battalions."

31:34.920 --> 31:37.780
- We'll build this house back up, Michael.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.500
I give you my word. It's
the least we can do.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.660
(Michael speaking Irish)

31:42.760 --> 31:43.980
- Listen up now, everybody,

31:44.080 --> 31:46.100
the undertakers will be here soon.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.340
Let's give Michael a wee moment.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.260
- Where's Ophelia?

31:51.360 --> 31:53.360
- Upstairs.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.240
- Ophelia.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.440
How's it going?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.300
Why are you hiding away up here?

32:16.400 --> 32:18.060
- I can't do it.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.620
- You should go down.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.720
You should say goodbye to him.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
It's okay.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.300
- He looks like he's sleeping,

32:43.400 --> 32:45.680
like if I touched him, he might wake up.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.080
- Well, you can touch him.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.200
(suspenseful music)

33:04.280 --> 33:07.860
- Sean, can you, ah, you came down.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.060
Good for you.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.460
How are you feeling?
- Much better, thank you.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.180
Sean persuaded me.
- Good man yourself, Sean.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.860
Will you give us a hand
in here for a minute?

33:15.960 --> 33:17.960
- Mm-hmm.

33:20.520 --> 33:24.660
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine here.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.760
- Okay.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.880
(clock ticking)

33:41.120 --> 33:44.020
(wood creaking)

33:44.120 --> 33:46.880
(wind whistling)

33:52.920 --> 33:55.600
(girl giggling)

34:16.280 --> 34:18.880
(solemn music)

34:26.680 --> 34:28.680
- Hey, there you are.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.140
- What's happening?
- It's okay.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.500
You just had a fright, that's all.

34:35.600 --> 34:39.460
This is Dr. Lenihan from the
medical center in Letterkenny.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.540
He was here to see my dad.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.340
- How are you feeling now?

34:43.440 --> 34:45.440
- Okay.

34:47.040 --> 34:47.820
- Thanks very much, James.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.920
I'll see you back downstairs.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.160
He said to take these to help you sleep.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.380
- What are they?

35:06.480 --> 35:08.840
- It's all right, I
told him about the baby.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.680
We're away now to the church.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.660
You should get some rest.
- I should come.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.260
- [Michael] No, you should stay here.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.880
(eerie music)

35:34.200 --> 35:36.200
- Michael.
- Yeah.

35:36.960 --> 35:41.020
- Say goodbye to your
dad, will you? For me.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.120
- [Michael] I will.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.340
(door creaking)

35:54.440 --> 35:57.560
(gentle piano music)

36:19.680 --> 36:22.320
(girl giggling)

36:29.000 --> 36:31.680
(ominous music)

36:41.840 --> 36:44.600
(pills rattling)

37:03.880 --> 37:06.440
(solemn music)

37:14.360 --> 37:17.420
(phone line trilling)

37:17.520 --> 37:19.060
- [Receptionist] Letterkenny
Medical Practice.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.580
- Yes, I'm trying to get
in touch with Dr. Lenihan.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.580
He prescribed me some medication which-

37:23.680 --> 37:25.140
- [Receptionist] Dr. Lenihan?

37:25.240 --> 37:26.660
- Yeah.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.140
- [Receptionist] We've no
doctor by that name here.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.780
(dramatic music)

37:29.880 --> 37:30.620
- Are you sure?

37:30.720 --> 37:31.780
- [Receptionist] Quite sure.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.120
Could it have been anyone else?

37:35.880 --> 37:37.880
- No, thank you.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.420
Thank you for your help.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.360
(Ophelia panting)

37:45.360 --> 37:48.280
(knocking on door)

37:50.720 --> 37:55.780
(Ophelia sniffling)
(Ophelia sighs)

37:55.880 --> 37:57.880
Can I help you?

37:58.800 --> 38:00.300
- Is Michael in?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.180
- He's at his father's funeral.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.780
Is there anything I can help with?

38:03.880 --> 38:05.880
- I'm looking for someone.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.900
Annabelle Lorimer, she's missing.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.180
(eerie music)

38:14.280 --> 38:15.180
Do you know her?

38:15.280 --> 38:19.280
(Annabelle and Michael arguing)

38:21.760 --> 38:23.500
- No.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.620
- This is the week before she disappeared.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.580
There's an address.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.420
- What is this?
- Her diary.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.900
That's Michael's address in Cambridge.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.560
(somber music)

38:36.160 --> 38:38.140
- That's Hardy.
- What?

38:38.240 --> 38:41.220
- This quotation, it's Thomas Hardy.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.220
- [Richard] Yeah, she's a writer.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.380
It's full of stuff like that.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.480
- I'm sorry I can't be more help.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.860
- She's my sister.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.380
- I really don't know anything.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.780
- Do you live here?

38:52.880 --> 38:54.880
- [Ophelia] I'm sorry.

39:05.960 --> 39:09.100
(people chattering quietly)

39:09.200 --> 39:12.200
- Hey, thanks for doing that, James.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.880
She was in such a state, I just...

39:17.080 --> 39:18.780
I don't know, I just needed
to calm her down, you know.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.880
- It was no bother, Michael.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
- Thank you.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.860
- [Richard] Dr. Callaghan?

39:29.960 --> 39:30.860
- Yes?

39:30.960 --> 39:32.500
- I'm sorry for your loss.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.860
- Thank you. Do I know you?
- No.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.960
Could I have a word?

39:38.320 --> 39:40.320
- Sure.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.220
Yeah, she was one of
my stand-ins last year.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.460
- Stand-ins, what's that?

39:48.560 --> 39:51.580
- She wasn't one of my regular
students is what I mean.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.420
A lot of my work is
covering for supervisors

39:54.520 --> 39:57.380
that are away or ill, you understand?

39:57.480 --> 39:59.480
- Why is your address in her diary?

40:01.920 --> 40:04.500
- My wife was a novelist, a
much better novelist than me.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.480
Annabelle asked me about
getting into writing,

40:05.560 --> 40:06.860
so I put them in touch.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.700
- When did they last meet?

40:08.800 --> 40:09.940
- They didn't, actually.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.700
There was a session booked
but she didn't show up.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.580
Look, I'm sorry to say this,

40:14.680 --> 40:16.700
but is there not an obvious
explanation to all this?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.420
- And what's that?

40:18.520 --> 40:20.640
- Well, Annabelle's a young girl,

40:22.040 --> 40:23.780
just finished university,
hanging around Cambridge.

40:23.880 --> 40:28.880
Do you not think maybe that
she just went away somewhere?

40:31.640 --> 40:32.580
- What does that mean?

40:32.680 --> 40:34.680
- I don't know.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.860
Maybe somewhere where her
brother couldn't follow her?

40:38.960 --> 40:40.500
With a boyfriend, a
girlfriend, you tell me.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.020
- And you'd know all about
that sort of thing, would you?

40:42.120 --> 40:42.940
- I'm sorry?

40:43.040 --> 40:45.140
- I spoke to your girlfriend at the house.

40:45.240 --> 40:45.980
- Who?

40:46.080 --> 40:47.840
- [Richard] I didn't catch her name,
but she was very helpful.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.520
(somber music)

41:20.400 --> 41:24.900
- Well, I'm afraid Hardy
isn't really my area,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
but we'll manage.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.820
- Annabelle's the most
organized person you could meet.

41:34.920 --> 41:35.660
But you think what?

41:35.760 --> 41:38.340
She just took off somewhere
with one tiny rucksack?

41:38.440 --> 41:39.900
- Rucksack?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
- [Richard] Only thing
missing from her room.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.360
(dramatic music)

41:55.440 --> 41:58.260
- Look, I'm sorry that you
had to come all this way.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.780
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful,

41:59.880 --> 42:01.880
but I really need to go.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.540
It's my father's funeral,
do you understand?

42:05.640 --> 42:08.160
She'll turn up, though, your sister.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.200
I'm sure of it.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.520
- Oh, my god.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
- Shit.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.240
(Ophelia panting)
