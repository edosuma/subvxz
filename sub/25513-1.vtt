03:24.095 --> 03:25.827
He's got stuff
going all across his face.

03:25.829 --> 03:27.796
It makes me sick.

03:27.798 --> 03:29.363
Sick.

03:29.365 --> 03:30.365
Not for nothing.

03:30.367 --> 03:31.766
I'm no Giorgio Armani,

03:31.768 --> 03:33.802
but where the fuck did
you get that shirt?

03:33.804 --> 03:35.369
What do you mean, what's
wrong with my shirt?

03:36.373 --> 03:37.439
It's a fucking J.C. Penneys.

03:37.441 --> 03:38.240
J.C. Penney?

03:38.242 --> 03:39.107
No shit.

03:39.109 --> 03:40.776
Fucking JC losers.

03:40.778 --> 03:42.243
What, d'you fucking
rob a homeless woman?

03:43.179 --> 03:44.112
Did you trim?

03:44.114 --> 03:44.847
I don't believe this guy.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.314
What's next, Velcro shoes?

03:46.316 --> 03:47.516
They're gonna like that?

03:47.518 --> 03:48.749
- Unbelievable.
- Fucking your mom

03:48.751 --> 03:49.818
- fucking dresses you?
- All right, all right,

03:49.820 --> 03:51.119
- all right.
- I swear to God,

03:51.121 --> 03:51.886
sometimes, I wanna
fucking smack you

03:51.888 --> 03:53.588
right upside the head, you know?

03:53.590 --> 03:54.823
Today it's the shirt, tomorrow
it's fucking Velcro shoes.

03:55.692 --> 03:57.259
You look like a
fucking homeless woman.

04:19.849 --> 04:21.281
You've got this look to you,

04:21.284 --> 04:22.851
the shirt, the stupid
napkin in your chest.

04:22.853 --> 04:23.986
You always make fun
of my shirt, it looks good.

04:23.988 --> 04:25.820
I wouldn't even
wipe my ass with that shirt,

04:25.822 --> 04:28.157
I wouldn't even wipe my
fucking ass with that shirt,

04:28.159 --> 04:29.690
- you know that?
- Fuck off, come on.

04:29.692 --> 04:31.260
I swear to God, sometimes,
there's something about you,

04:31.262 --> 04:32.861
I wanna fucking smack you
right upside the head.

04:32.863 --> 04:33.861
You look like an idiot.

04:33.863 --> 04:35.229
Enough, all right.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.164
Velcro
shoes, what is it,

04:36.166 --> 04:37.366
your fucking Velcro shoes?

04:37.368 --> 04:38.799
- No, he's got boots.
- I got boots on.

04:38.801 --> 04:41.138
A lot of
money for J.C. Penneys.

04:41.704 --> 04:41.873
Anyway.

04:42.505 --> 04:43.805
Boys.

04:43.807 --> 04:44.873
Nothing wrong with my shirt.

04:44.875 --> 04:45.840
A lot of money
for J. C. Penneys.

04:45.842 --> 04:46.674
Oh my goodness.

04:46.676 --> 04:47.310
A lot of money.

04:48.378 --> 04:50.514
I'd like to say a few words.

04:56.921 --> 04:57.889
Sal,

04:58.822 --> 05:01.325
thank you for welcoming
me into your family.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.829
You've always been
like a brother to me.

05:09.899 --> 05:11.902
So is everything set?

05:13.204 --> 05:14.669
Yeah, but I need
to know how much.

05:14.671 --> 05:16.440
You didn't exactly tell
me on the phone and...

05:17.740 --> 05:19.676
I'm not risking my probation
for something small.

05:20.411 --> 05:21.613
Trust me, it's big.

05:25.615 --> 05:27.418
How big we talking?

05:28.485 --> 05:30.555
It's buy an
island kind of big.

05:33.423 --> 05:34.591
Only issue is,

05:35.759 --> 05:37.762
I think we're gonna
need another person.

05:38.295 --> 05:39.297
What?

05:40.731 --> 05:41.933
Alex, that wasn't part of
our plan and you know that.

05:43.034 --> 05:44.700
This is the same shit that
fucked me up last time,

05:44.702 --> 05:45.500
you keep on doing
this, you can't...

05:45.502 --> 05:45.937
Babe, babe, relax.

05:47.471 --> 05:51.242
We'll never have to work
again if we pull this off.

05:52.442 --> 05:53.942
Look, you said you
wanted to be done

05:53.944 --> 05:55.577
with all this low level shit,

05:55.579 --> 05:57.649
well, here's your chance.

06:03.753 --> 06:05.389
So a toast to you.

06:07.524 --> 06:08.356
Salut.

06:08.358 --> 06:09.928
Salut.

06:13.029 --> 06:15.465
Please, please, sit down.

06:24.041 --> 06:28.810
Tomorrow is a new day
for the Vertucci family.

06:28.812 --> 06:29.945
You're here in this room with me

06:29.947 --> 06:32.781
because you all made sacrifices.

06:32.783 --> 06:36.955
Took a lot of sweat and
blood to get where we are,

06:39.822 --> 06:41.993
and I always reward loyalty.

06:43.426 --> 06:45.963
I take
care of my family.

06:49.065 --> 06:51.536
2 million dollars,

06:52.435 --> 06:54.272
let that sink in.

06:55.005 --> 06:56.707
For one coke deal.

06:57.908 --> 06:58.710
One.

07:06.716 --> 07:08.252
So let's be clear,

07:09.986 --> 07:12.589
there will not be any mistakes.

07:18.995 --> 07:20.031
Are we clear?

07:25.034 --> 07:25.936
Good.

07:28.538 --> 07:30.440
That's all for tonight.

07:54.565 --> 07:55.733
Vin, you okay?

08:03.507 --> 08:05.440
Yeah, I'm okay, Unc.

08:05.442 --> 08:07.508
Please don't tell
me it's fucking Mikey.

08:07.510 --> 08:09.378
You know he hates me,
he's the last person

08:09.380 --> 08:10.611
who's gonna help us out.

08:10.613 --> 08:11.912
What do you want me to say,

08:11.914 --> 08:13.714
that I know 20 people
I could call up?

08:13.716 --> 08:16.084
You're lucky I
even know someone.

08:16.086 --> 08:18.620
I'm going to the washroom.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.515
Vin, come here.

08:55.124 --> 08:56.824
What?

08:56.826 --> 08:58.492
You're my blood.

08:58.494 --> 09:02.496
I trust you with my business,
I trust you with my life.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.064
If your father was still alive,

09:04.066 --> 09:06.500
he'd be very proud of
you, you know that?

09:06.502 --> 09:08.068
I know.

09:08.070 --> 09:08.970
I know that.

09:08.972 --> 09:09.971
Aye, Vinny, Vinny, Vinny,

09:09.973 --> 09:12.106
I don't know what's going on,

09:12.108 --> 09:16.211
but I can't have you of all
people dazing in and out.

09:16.213 --> 09:19.083
I gotta know I can count on you.

09:20.783 --> 09:21.716
You can count on me, Unc.

09:21.718 --> 09:23.985
Don't bullshit me.

09:23.987 --> 09:27.058
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

09:30.993 --> 09:32.964
I don't know, I mean,

09:34.131 --> 09:36.597
you think we can
trust these guys?

09:36.599 --> 09:38.199
We've never dealt
with them before.

09:38.201 --> 09:41.602
This thing is moving real quick.

09:41.604 --> 09:44.972
Vinny, life is
all about risks.

09:44.974 --> 09:47.608
Smart ones, stupid ones.

09:47.610 --> 09:50.846
I'm not a man to
take stupid risks,

09:50.848 --> 09:54.482
and this deal will set
our family up for life.

09:54.484 --> 09:57.718
But Unc, it's $2 million
of the family's money.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.754
We don't do business
outside of the family.

09:59.756 --> 10:00.755
I just think maybe you should...

10:00.757 --> 10:02.857
I didn't ask what you think.

10:02.859 --> 10:04.161
Just stay strong

10:05.496 --> 10:07.895
and make sure everything
is set up for tomorrow.

10:07.897 --> 10:08.996
Yeah, but my dad...

10:08.998 --> 10:09.965
Zitto!

10:09.967 --> 10:12.132
This conversation is over.

10:12.134 --> 10:15.038
See you tomorrow
night at midnight.

10:18.608 --> 10:19.444
Hey,

10:20.911 --> 10:21.845
I love you.

11:37.588 --> 11:38.789
Hi stranger,

11:41.992 --> 11:43.725
where've you been?

11:43.727 --> 11:45.961
You don't love me anymore, huh?

11:45.963 --> 11:48.129
Why you stay away?

11:48.131 --> 11:49.733
So good to see you.

11:53.836 --> 11:56.004
It's nice to see you too.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.340
I was just in the area,

11:58.342 --> 12:01.275
thought I'd come say hi.

12:01.277 --> 12:02.312
How you been?

12:05.248 --> 12:06.316
I been okay.

12:07.316 --> 12:08.717
I been good.

12:08.719 --> 12:10.318
Hey, come and sit, let's chat.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.752
Business sucks.

12:11.754 --> 12:13.221
I got time coming out of my ass.

12:13.223 --> 12:14.755
Let's sit, chat, catch up.

12:14.757 --> 12:15.957
Sit down.

12:15.959 --> 12:17.225
I can't, I can't,
I got, I got,

12:17.227 --> 12:19.394
I got stuff I gotta do.

12:19.396 --> 12:21.699
But next time, I promise.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.299
How's that girl of
yours, how's Nicole?

12:25.301 --> 12:26.167
You still together?

12:26.169 --> 12:27.869
What's going on?

12:27.871 --> 12:30.308
Yeah, we're still together.

12:31.742 --> 12:34.842
You know, just kinda dealing
with some stuff, you know?

12:34.844 --> 12:36.781
Oh, what kinda stuff?

12:40.416 --> 12:42.619
I just found out we're

12:44.754 --> 12:46.254
having a kid.

12:48.425 --> 12:49.890
Ah you?

12:49.892 --> 12:50.924
A kid?

12:50.926 --> 12:52.894
The kid's having a kid?

12:52.896 --> 12:54.162
- Yeah.
- I don't believe it.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.800
Congratulations,
that's wonderful.

12:59.368 --> 13:01.436
Kind of a lot to
handle right now.

13:01.438 --> 13:03.307
Sure, that's life.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.207
You grow up,

13:06.209 --> 13:07.377
you have babies.

13:09.378 --> 13:10.313
Yeah.

13:11.781 --> 13:14.182
You're gonna do great.

13:14.184 --> 13:18.389
Ah, you're gonna be fine.

13:19.422 --> 13:21.024
Mikey, come on.

13:51.988 --> 13:54.121
Okay, what do you want, Dale?

13:54.123 --> 13:56.124
I need your help.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.125
I'm not interested.

13:58.127 --> 13:58.992
Just hear me out.

13:58.994 --> 14:00.227
Here we go again.

14:00.229 --> 14:01.730
Wait, this time
it's different.

14:01.732 --> 14:02.867
Yeah, right.

14:04.334 --> 14:07.802
You always say that, and
yet it's always the same.

14:07.804 --> 14:10.004
Last time didn't go
exactly as planned, okay?

14:10.006 --> 14:11.139
Shit happens.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.741
Okay, anyway, not
enough time to explain.

14:13.743 --> 14:16.880
Tomorrow night, one
move, $2 million.

14:18.982 --> 14:20.448
Enough money for the
rest of our lives.

14:46.877 --> 14:49.447
Mikey, at least let me explain.

14:50.847 --> 14:53.014
The more you explain,
the worse it always sounds,

14:53.016 --> 14:55.316
and like I said,
I'm not interested.

14:55.318 --> 14:58.452
Look, we've been watching
these guys for a while now,

14:58.454 --> 15:00.053
trust me on this one.

15:00.055 --> 15:01.489
We?

15:01.491 --> 15:03.327
Who the fuck's "we"?

15:05.295 --> 15:07.395
Me and Alex, but I called
you because I know that you...

15:07.397 --> 15:08.733
Wait a second.

15:10.499 --> 15:11.501
Alex?

15:13.335 --> 15:18.041
The fucking waitress you're
seeing from that restaurant?

15:20.042 --> 15:20.877
Wow,

15:22.579 --> 15:26.784
you fucking called me up
to rob the local mafia?

15:27.917 --> 15:29.217
Well, no, not exactly.

15:29.219 --> 15:33.188
Look, if I really
wanted to kill myself,

15:33.190 --> 15:37.058
which, trust me,
Dale, there are days,

15:37.060 --> 15:39.294
I'd just fucking overdose.

15:39.296 --> 15:41.462
It'd be a lot simpler
and most importantly,

15:41.464 --> 15:43.467
it wouldn't be with you.

15:44.467 --> 15:45.536
Whoa, relax.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.468
When did you start caring
whose money it was?

15:48.470 --> 15:53.243
Um, I don't know, when it
became the mob's fucking money.

15:55.244 --> 15:58.545
Look Mikey, I really
need you on this one.

15:58.547 --> 16:00.081
I can't do it without you.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.518
This is what I thought
brothers were for.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.855
Step-brothers.

16:06.555 --> 16:10.994
I'm tired, really tired,
of always helping you out.

16:11.961 --> 16:13.861
I said I was done.

16:13.863 --> 16:17.133
What part of that
don't you understand?

16:23.473 --> 16:26.573
All right, you don't wanna
do it for me, that's fine.

16:26.575 --> 16:29.244
Do it for yourself, Mikey.

16:29.246 --> 16:32.380
Split the profit, go
our separate ways,

16:32.382 --> 16:34.882
you'll never have to
hear from me again,

16:34.884 --> 16:36.550
and who knows, it could
be that fresh start

16:36.552 --> 16:39.587
you've always been
talking about.

16:39.589 --> 16:41.956
I mean, I don't
see you in years,

16:41.958 --> 16:44.558
and you come to me for help,

16:44.560 --> 16:46.162
and I help you out.

16:50.432 --> 16:52.969
So in a way, you kinda owe me.

16:56.105 --> 16:56.906
Owe you?

16:59.108 --> 16:59.910
Owe you?

17:01.143 --> 17:03.613
I don't owe you fuck all, Dale.

17:05.915 --> 17:09.050
You know, you're even lucky
I'm fucking here right now

17:09.051 --> 17:10.651
listening to this bullshit.

17:10.653 --> 17:14.525
All those stupid fucking
jobs I did for you.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.267
I was finally
starting to move on,

17:25.468 --> 17:29.536
then I fucking called
you, now look at me.

17:29.538 --> 17:31.141
I can't fucking sleep.

17:35.210 --> 17:39.647
I got this shitty fucking car,

17:39.649 --> 17:41.582
and it's because of
you that I'm hopped up

17:41.584 --> 17:43.420
on drugs all the time.

17:44.321 --> 17:46.223
Do I look happy to you?

17:48.223 --> 17:49.092
No.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.663
So no, Dale, I
don't owe you shit.

18:02.338 --> 18:04.371
Look, I know it's
none of my business,

18:04.373 --> 18:07.675
but you never told
me what happened.

18:07.677 --> 18:10.111
I don't remember it all, Dale.

18:10.113 --> 18:13.081
And you're right, it is none
of your fucking business,

18:13.083 --> 18:16.684
because you're the last
person in the fucking world

18:16.686 --> 18:19.219
I would tell anything
important to.

18:19.221 --> 18:20.487
Sorry for caring.

18:20.489 --> 18:23.190
You don't care about
anybody but yourself.

18:23.192 --> 18:24.691
It's all about Dale,

18:24.693 --> 18:26.696
fucking Dale, Dale, Dale.

18:39.542 --> 18:40.411
Look,

18:41.710 --> 18:45.412
I know I screwed up
a lot in the past,

18:45.414 --> 18:48.216
and who knows, maybe this job

18:48.218 --> 18:52.656
will be the best thing that
has ever happened to you.

18:55.424 --> 18:56.726
It's $2 million.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.365
Please just think about it.

19:14.443 --> 19:15.743
Fine.

19:43.773 --> 19:45.339
Okay, Dale, let's get
to the fucking point,

19:45.341 --> 19:46.774
what's the job?

19:46.776 --> 19:49.076
Okay, so you know that
black gang, the Suits, right?

19:49.078 --> 19:50.477
From what I know is
that they're having

19:50.479 --> 19:52.447
a large coke deal
with the mob so...

19:52.449 --> 19:54.482
I'm sorry, what?

19:54.484 --> 19:55.615
Having a large coke
deal with the mob.

19:55.617 --> 19:58.788
Yeah, Dale, I fucking
heard that part.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.489
I'm talking about
the fucking Suits.

20:02.491 --> 20:04.758
What, you just chose
to leave that part out?

20:04.760 --> 20:08.161
I didn't think
it was important.

20:08.163 --> 20:11.334
You didn't think
that was important?

20:22.812 --> 20:25.112
Hey, hey come on.

20:25.114 --> 20:27.817
Okay, I should
have mentioned it.

20:31.821 --> 20:32.823
Screw you.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.124
You just can't leave,
I need your help.

20:37.126 --> 20:39.829
I thought this
would help you out.

20:44.366 --> 20:45.201
Help me?

20:46.401 --> 20:47.834
How the fuck does
this help me out?

20:47.836 --> 20:50.641
What, are you
fucking kidding me?

20:52.842 --> 20:56.677
First you tell me we're
fucking robbing the mob,

20:56.679 --> 20:58.778
and now you're telling me the
fucking Suits are involved,

20:58.780 --> 21:00.247
are you fucking
hearing yourself?

21:00.249 --> 21:01.482
Yeah, I thought this
would help you out,

21:01.484 --> 21:02.550
what's your problem?

21:04.487 --> 21:05.919
My problem?

21:05.921 --> 21:07.688
You're my fucking problem,

21:07.690 --> 21:10.526
you are always my
fucking problem.

21:13.296 --> 21:15.565
We are not fucking friends.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.835
Why do you think I left?

21:21.938 --> 21:23.540
Yeah, thought so.

21:24.873 --> 21:28.277
You know, nothing
ever changes with you.

21:30.279 --> 21:31.447
See you round.

21:32.315 --> 21:33.316
I'm sorry.

21:41.857 --> 21:43.890
I'm sorry, I fucked
up last time.

21:43.892 --> 21:45.595
What else can I say?

21:49.565 --> 21:52.902
Dale, I don't wanna
talk about it, okay?

21:55.337 --> 21:58.441
Look Mikey, I know
we're not close,

22:01.878 --> 22:03.847
but we're still family.

22:04.913 --> 22:07.480
I called you because
I needed you,

22:07.482 --> 22:08.916
and if you don't
wanna help me, fine,

22:08.918 --> 22:10.487
walk out the door.

22:11.754 --> 22:14.591
But then it's my
life on the line.

22:24.933 --> 22:25.902
Fine.

22:40.583 --> 22:41.384
Fine.

22:42.451 --> 22:45.319
But we're done after this.

22:45.321 --> 22:48.255
And from now on, you're going
to fucking tell me everything.

22:48.257 --> 22:48.959
Okay.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.526
Good.

22:53.528 --> 22:55.963
I'm gonna get my drink.

22:55.965 --> 22:59.336
Yeah, like how you
tell me everything.

23:07.343 --> 23:08.679
What was that?

23:10.279 --> 23:11.678
Dale, I fucking
tell you everything

23:11.680 --> 23:14.649
I fucking want to
tell you, that's it.

23:14.651 --> 23:17.884
The rest is none of
your fucking business.

23:17.886 --> 23:20.388
Well, I'm sorry that you
can't fucking remember.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.822
Maybe if you talk about
it, you'd be able to.

23:21.824 --> 23:23.890
Oh, so now you're my
fucking psychiatrist?

23:23.892 --> 23:26.694
Well, this night just
keeps getting better.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.396
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?

23:28.398 --> 23:29.096
No I just thought, like...

23:29.098 --> 23:30.831
Oh, oh, oh, you just thought,

23:30.833 --> 23:32.565
oh wow, now you know what it
feels like to fucking think.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.001
Well, sorry that all I
know was that you were in

23:34.003 --> 23:36.003
some type of accident and
she's not around anymore.

23:36.005 --> 23:37.571
What's that mean?

23:37.573 --> 23:39.974
What, you guys break up?

23:39.976 --> 23:41.812
She broke up with you.

23:43.313 --> 23:45.513
Wow, I fucking knew it.

23:45.515 --> 23:47.014
That's why you're acting like
such a dick all the time.

23:47.016 --> 23:48.682
Excuse me?

23:48.684 --> 23:49.817
Yeah, you heard me, just
'cause she dumped your ass

23:49.819 --> 23:51.584
doesn't mean you have to act
like a dick all the time.

23:51.586 --> 23:52.953
It's been a fucking
year, Mikey, move on man.

23:52.955 --> 23:54.322
Don't
fucking touch me.

23:54.324 --> 23:55.025
Hey!

23:56.859 --> 23:57.957
You guys wanna get rough,

23:57.959 --> 24:00.463
you get the fuck out of my bar.

24:01.430 --> 24:04.034
Buy a drink or get the fuck out.

24:12.808 --> 24:15.311
Yo Mikey, you need to chill.

24:19.582 --> 24:23.053
Don't ever fucking
talk about her again.

24:25.121 --> 24:26.055
Okay.

24:30.826 --> 24:34.998
Because you have no idea
what I've been through.

24:38.968 --> 24:39.969
I'm sorry.

24:45.374 --> 24:47.076
I need a cigarette.

25:01.657 --> 25:02.993
Girl problems.

25:04.594 --> 25:07.397
That's why I
leave mine at home.

25:09.931 --> 25:12.800
Can I have two beers?

25:12.802 --> 25:13.904
Yeah, sure.

27:30.539 --> 27:34.243
Hey, sorry, we're just
closing up right now.

27:36.077 --> 27:38.678
Sorry, um, I was really hoping

27:38.680 --> 27:41.047
I could get something
for my girlfriend.

27:41.049 --> 27:42.885
Wait, Nicole, right?

27:44.253 --> 27:45.619
Yeah.

27:45.621 --> 27:47.787
You're looking at
engagement rings.

27:47.789 --> 27:49.023
Yeah, you know what?

27:49.025 --> 27:49.957
Okay, I think I got
a minute for you,

27:49.959 --> 27:52.262
do you wanna come over here?

27:56.065 --> 27:57.797
Is there anything
you were looking at

27:57.799 --> 27:59.502
that caught your eye?

28:06.275 --> 28:07.774
That one, can I see that one?

28:07.776 --> 28:08.909
- This one right here?
- Yeah.

28:08.911 --> 28:10.710
This one is so pretty.

28:10.712 --> 28:12.845
Okay, let's see your hand.

28:12.847 --> 28:13.849
Here you go.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.350
There you go.

28:16.352 --> 28:18.287
This ring is so pretty.

28:20.256 --> 28:23.826
She's gonna love it,
she's gonna love it.

28:29.998 --> 28:33.202
It's, er, a bit more
than I can spend.

28:36.205 --> 28:37.541
For you today.

28:39.075 --> 28:40.009
How's that?

28:44.313 --> 28:46.749
It's still too expensive.

28:48.116 --> 28:49.018
Do you have

28:51.319 --> 28:53.987
anything a little
bit more reasonable?

28:53.989 --> 28:55.889
Just of all the
engagement rings,

28:55.891 --> 28:58.027
this is one of the lowest.

29:00.328 --> 29:01.330
I'm so sorry.

29:03.332 --> 29:04.331
It's fine, thanks,
thanks for your time.

29:04.333 --> 29:05.332
You know what though?

29:05.334 --> 29:06.899
Wait a minute, I have an idea.

29:06.901 --> 29:09.969
I might have something
else for you.

29:09.971 --> 29:11.775
Yeah, it's still here.

29:14.343 --> 29:15.842
It's a little bit different

29:15.844 --> 29:17.343
'cause it's not an
engagement ring,

29:17.345 --> 29:19.348
but it's a wedding band.

29:20.348 --> 29:23.352
It's still very
special, very pretty.

29:25.888 --> 29:29.790
Just it's not about the
diamonds and the money.

29:29.792 --> 29:30.627
Right?

29:32.428 --> 29:35.031
It's the thought that counts.

31:00.216 --> 31:02.218
Another sex tape, man.

31:06.020 --> 31:06.955
Let's go!

31:08.223 --> 31:10.023
It's locked!

31:11.893 --> 31:12.759
It's locked!

31:14.462 --> 31:16.095
Lift, you pussy!

31:16.097 --> 31:17.866
Come on, there we go.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.468
There's
so much stuff here,

31:22.470 --> 31:24.004
it's gonna take us forever.

31:24.006 --> 31:24.871
Here.

31:24.873 --> 31:27.174
Us?

31:27.176 --> 31:28.309
No us.

31:28.311 --> 31:30.476
Let's go, princess, out of
the fucking truck, come on.

31:30.478 --> 31:32.146
Unload the truck.

31:35.116 --> 31:36.449
I do everything around here.

32:12.822 --> 32:14.290
Can I help you?

32:15.524 --> 32:18.524
Yeah, you gotta be
this tall to talk to me.

32:18.526 --> 32:20.360
Oh, you must be
looking for my dick then.

32:20.362 --> 32:21.527
Right, Mr. Vertucci.

32:21.529 --> 32:22.528
Mr. Vertucci?

32:22.530 --> 32:23.496
Ah, what about him?

32:23.498 --> 32:24.433
Hm, hm, hm?

32:25.366 --> 32:26.833
Welcome Mr., um?

32:26.835 --> 32:27.834
Tyson.

32:27.836 --> 32:29.535
Call me Tyson.

32:29.537 --> 32:31.839
My uncle just wants to make
sure everything is ready.

32:31.841 --> 32:33.306
You know we're good on our end.

32:33.308 --> 32:34.541
Oh yes,

32:34.543 --> 32:35.976
everything'll be
ready for tonight,

32:35.978 --> 32:37.244
I'm a man of my word.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.078
Good.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.446
My uncle is very excited

32:39.448 --> 32:41.982
to do business with
you, Mr. Vertucci.

32:41.984 --> 32:45.485
You know, we usually
don't sell outside.

32:45.487 --> 32:47.321
I respect that.

32:47.323 --> 32:49.555
We usually don't do
business outside either.

32:49.557 --> 32:50.859
Fair enough.

32:52.126 --> 32:54.061
You're familiar with
our product, right?

32:54.063 --> 32:55.562
Word's out that it's the best,

32:55.564 --> 32:57.566
and I trust my sources.

32:59.067 --> 33:00.399
That's good,
but I'm here to make sure

33:00.401 --> 33:02.572
everything runs smoothly, so

33:03.972 --> 33:05.207
give her a try.

33:08.276 --> 33:09.278
Funny guy.

33:22.557 --> 33:24.291
It's not bad.

33:24.293 --> 33:25.592
There's your approval.

33:25.594 --> 33:29.396
Bruno's got a nose for
that kind of thing.

33:29.398 --> 33:30.900
So, all thousands?

33:31.901 --> 33:33.900
That'd be great.

33:33.902 --> 33:35.569
We'll see you
tonight, Mr. Vertucci.

33:35.571 --> 33:36.436
Tonight.

33:36.438 --> 33:38.107
All right.

33:45.546 --> 33:46.548
Seriously?

33:47.583 --> 33:49.585
Another sex tape, man.

33:55.591 --> 33:58.592
What am I supposed
to do with this, huh?

33:58.594 --> 34:01.460
This guy, he keeps
making bad decision

34:01.462 --> 34:05.200
after bad decision, and
I'm supposed to what?

34:06.401 --> 34:08.904
Just stand around and take it?

34:10.071 --> 34:10.906
Huh?

34:13.641 --> 34:15.610
Just go along with it?

34:24.652 --> 34:26.022
Nothing, Pops?

34:30.225 --> 34:32.629
All right, Dad, thanks again.

34:34.663 --> 34:38.598
Don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it.

34:38.600 --> 34:39.668
I got this one.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.333
Hey babe,

35:13.335 --> 35:17.240
I'm gonna have some water,
do you want anything?

35:53.575 --> 35:55.444
Hey, come back to bed.

36:10.759 --> 36:14.194
I'm so excited
we're gonna do this.

36:14.196 --> 36:15.828
Finally be able to go wherever,

36:15.830 --> 36:17.733
buy whatever we want.

36:21.770 --> 36:23.737
Just do exactly
what I told you to do,

36:23.739 --> 36:25.404
and we'll be fine, all right?

36:25.406 --> 36:27.576
Mikey's never let me down.

36:28.743 --> 36:30.680
He's never let me down.

36:31.779 --> 36:34.281
You'll be there, right?

36:34.283 --> 36:35.781
Yeah.

36:35.783 --> 36:36.752
Yeah?

37:31.140 --> 37:31.841
Really?

37:33.375 --> 37:35.841
What, you didn't know
11 came before 12?

37:35.843 --> 37:36.842
Leave me alone, Mikey.

37:36.844 --> 37:37.814
Fuck you.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.549
Get in the fucking car.

37:43.551 --> 37:44.687
Fucking idiot.

38:03.872 --> 38:06.906
Wait a second, are
you fucking high?

38:06.908 --> 38:08.308
What?

38:08.310 --> 38:09.643
Are you fucking
high right now?

38:09.645 --> 38:10.710
No, I'm not high.

38:10.712 --> 38:11.810
Well, you look fucking high.

38:11.812 --> 38:12.879
I'm not high!

38:12.881 --> 38:14.313
Alexis is gonna
meet me at the bar,

38:14.315 --> 38:15.448
we need to go, okay?

38:15.450 --> 38:16.319
Let's go.

38:20.254 --> 38:23.455
I ain't going anywhere,
this car ain't fucking moving.

38:23.457 --> 38:27.194
Dale, I tell you to do
one goddamn fucking thing.

38:27.196 --> 38:29.562
The most basic of things,
the thing that you said

38:29.564 --> 38:30.897
and you promised
you wouldn't do.

38:30.899 --> 38:32.899
Look, I'm not
fucking high, okay?

38:32.901 --> 38:34.201
I'm nervous.

38:34.203 --> 38:35.738
Nervous?

38:37.339 --> 38:39.605
Look, I'm not gonna
fuck this up, okay?

38:39.607 --> 38:41.408
I know how important
this shit is.

38:41.410 --> 38:42.908
I can't believe you
actually think I'd do that.

38:42.910 --> 38:44.476
Well, it wouldn't surprise
me, 'cause you've done

38:44.478 --> 38:46.812
some pretty fucking stupid
things before, Dale,

38:46.814 --> 38:48.681
and this would seem appropriate.

38:48.683 --> 38:49.482
Fuck you, okay?

38:49.484 --> 38:50.917
I'm not an idiot.

38:50.919 --> 38:52.585
I told you I was gonna lay
off the shit, and I did.

38:52.587 --> 38:53.823
I'm just wired.

38:54.756 --> 38:55.625
Mm-hmm.

39:04.765 --> 39:07.234
You know, you'd better not
be fucking high right now,

39:07.236 --> 39:08.467
because if you are, I'm gone,

39:08.469 --> 39:09.902
I'll just fucking
leave you there.

39:09.904 --> 39:11.504
There's no fucking way
that I'm gonna get buried

39:11.506 --> 39:12.938
in a fucking ditch for you,

39:12.940 --> 39:14.373
and you better know
that right now.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.509
Hey, I don't tell you
how to live your life

39:16.511 --> 39:18.478
so don't tell me
how to live mine.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.750
Just drive the fucking car.

39:22.783 --> 39:23.949
You know, I'm gonna be
glad when this is done

39:23.951 --> 39:26.922
and I never have
to see you again.

39:47.942 --> 39:50.277
Why are you
dropping me off here?

39:50.279 --> 39:51.645
The restaurant's a
couple of blocks away,

39:51.647 --> 39:53.950
can you bring me any closer?

40:00.022 --> 40:02.955
Why don't I just drive
you to the front door,

40:02.957 --> 40:05.924
and then call them and let
them know you're coming?

40:05.926 --> 40:07.826
Oh, and while we're at
it, why don't we just

40:07.828 --> 40:10.533
politely ask them for the money?

40:11.565 --> 40:12.435
Get out.

40:17.439 --> 40:18.804
Remember, there's not
gonna be a lot of people

40:18.806 --> 40:20.674
watching the money, so
just make sure you...

40:20.676 --> 40:24.777
Dale, I don't need you
to worry about me, okay?

40:24.779 --> 40:28.948
I don't even know exactly
how I'm going to do this yet,

40:28.950 --> 40:30.417
so the last thing I
need to worry about

40:30.419 --> 40:33.585
is you doing something stupid.

40:33.587 --> 40:34.656
I'll be fine.

40:37.024 --> 40:38.793
I'll see you later.

40:43.698 --> 40:47.002
You know what helps
me when I'm nervous?

40:48.870 --> 40:49.504
Gum.

40:51.806 --> 40:54.310
You know, when you chew and...

40:58.346 --> 40:59.047
Okay.

41:06.087 --> 41:08.620
Oh, I brought you
something, one sec.

41:08.622 --> 41:11.826
Oh, what is it
now, a chocolate bar?

41:15.629 --> 41:16.898
Mikey.

41:18.065 --> 41:18.964
What the f...

41:24.772 --> 41:27.073
Found this in the
back of my closet.

41:27.075 --> 41:28.975
I forgot I even owned it.

41:28.977 --> 41:32.047
I wore it for
Halloween once I think.

41:37.585 --> 41:40.388
This way they don't
see your face.

43:20.589 --> 43:23.890
Welcome to my
restaurant, Mr. Jackson.

43:23.892 --> 43:26.125
Please, call me
Eddie, Mr. Vertucci,

43:26.127 --> 43:28.495
and the pleasure's all mine.

43:28.497 --> 43:30.763
I feel like this is the
start of something great.

43:30.765 --> 43:32.598
Yes it is.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.167
Everything's in order.

43:34.169 --> 43:36.034
Meanwhile, would you
care for a drink?

43:36.036 --> 43:37.837
Please, thank you.

43:37.839 --> 43:40.142
Gentlemen, right this way.

43:45.212 --> 43:46.214
Yes it does.

43:50.218 --> 43:53.656
You could, uh, wait
out here with me.

43:55.122 --> 43:58.223
Touch me again and I will
break your fucking hand.

43:58.225 --> 44:00.225
Which one,
this one or this one?

44:00.227 --> 44:01.627
I'm getting
tired of your shit,

44:01.629 --> 44:02.929
come on, let's go, right now!

44:04.165 --> 44:07.065
Hey, hey,
hey, everybody chill.

44:07.067 --> 44:08.234
Hey!

44:10.238 --> 44:13.806
Hey, hey, he said
it was cool, baby.

44:13.808 --> 44:15.641
We just trying to
make some paper, okay?

44:15.643 --> 44:16.808
Everything all right?

44:16.810 --> 44:20.181
You shut up, go
lock the fucking door.

44:25.020 --> 44:26.752
Go lock the door, man.

44:26.754 --> 44:28.254
Go lock the door, man.

44:28.256 --> 44:32.558
Hey, sorry man, he still has
a lot to learn about respect.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.092
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Restaurant's closed come on.

44:34.094 --> 44:35.261
Yeah, yeah, we're
leaving already.

44:35.263 --> 44:38.031
Yeah, come on, come on.

44:38.033 --> 44:40.268
Hey, nice dress, sweetheart.

44:42.270 --> 44:44.971
Oh man, it's party time.

44:44.973 --> 44:48.040
Hey, I want a drink because I
met this girl and she gave me

44:48.042 --> 44:49.275
- the best blow job.
- Hey,

44:49.277 --> 44:51.578
- get out, we're closed.
- Wait, I want a drink!

44:51.580 --> 44:52.848
- Wait!
- Get out!

45:20.741 --> 45:22.076
Let's do this.

45:24.111 --> 45:25.113
It's locked.

45:25.980 --> 45:29.147
Wow, you're a fucking idiot.

45:29.149 --> 45:30.216
The keys.

45:30.218 --> 45:31.016
All right.

45:32.252 --> 45:34.319
Oh, my lord,
let's go, come on.

45:34.321 --> 45:36.325
All right, all right.

45:37.325 --> 45:38.324
Where do you put this
thing, where's the hole?

45:38.326 --> 45:40.161
Where do you put it?

45:41.830 --> 45:43.830
Press the button.

45:43.832 --> 45:45.364
Oh, it's one of
those fancy ones.

45:54.908 --> 45:56.141
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

45:56.143 --> 45:57.109
All right.

46:00.181 --> 46:02.181
That's fucking cash.

46:02.183 --> 46:03.315
All right, let's go, let's go.

46:03.317 --> 46:04.350
What are we, the
fucking bank over here?

46:04.352 --> 46:05.183
Let's go!

46:05.185 --> 46:06.319
We've
gotta count it first.

46:06.321 --> 46:07.353
Yeah, we, no. You.

46:07.355 --> 46:08.187
All right, I gotta count it,

46:08.189 --> 46:10.056
I gotta do everything
myself, I know.

46:10.058 --> 46:11.357
Jesus Christ.

46:11.359 --> 46:13.661
- Goddamn it.
- Oh, fuck me.

46:14.995 --> 46:16.663
Can I ask you something?

46:16.665 --> 46:18.665
Why the fuck you
trying to load a car

46:18.667 --> 46:20.033
with keys in your hands?

46:20.035 --> 46:21.366
The fuck's wrong with you?

46:21.368 --> 46:22.301
What does it matter?

46:22.303 --> 46:23.435
Jesus, fuck off.

46:23.437 --> 46:25.370
Fuck off?

46:25.372 --> 46:28.775
The fucking valet parker grew
a pair of balls on him, huh?

46:28.777 --> 46:30.042
Look, you wanna
help me or not?

46:30.044 --> 46:31.176
Hey, you better
watch your mouth,

46:31.178 --> 46:32.277
I'd take that comment
more seriously

46:32.279 --> 46:34.147
if you didn't have those
fucking keys in your hands.

46:34.149 --> 46:34.946
All right.

46:34.948 --> 46:36.214
Let's go.

46:36.216 --> 46:37.350
You wanna be more serious?

46:37.352 --> 46:38.620
How about this?

46:41.388 --> 46:43.321
There, how you like that, huh?

46:43.323 --> 46:44.690
Geez, they're all wet.

46:44.692 --> 46:45.891
Yeah, wet like your sister.

46:45.893 --> 46:48.763
Pick up the fucking
money, let's go.

47:11.252 --> 47:12.121
Hey,

47:13.821 --> 47:14.823
he with you?

47:16.256 --> 47:17.223
What?

47:17.225 --> 47:19.125
Is he with you?

47:21.261 --> 47:23.495
Does it look like he is?

47:23.497 --> 47:25.397
I don't know.

47:25.399 --> 47:26.234
Prove it.

47:34.442 --> 47:35.741
Yo.

47:47.221 --> 47:48.453
Motherfucker!

47:48.455 --> 47:49.688
Ty, Ty, Ty, what's up?

47:49.690 --> 47:54.962
This motherfucking
guy tried to fucking shoot me!

47:55.830 --> 47:58.029
Mr. Vertucci, what's going on?

47:58.031 --> 48:00.299
I could ask you the
same thing, Mr. Jackson.

48:00.301 --> 48:02.033
Yo, this motherfucker
ain't with us.

48:02.035 --> 48:04.870
Yeah, well he
ain't with us either.

48:04.872 --> 48:07.375
Vertucci, I don't like this.

48:09.009 --> 48:10.442
Excuse me?

48:10.444 --> 48:14.115
Are you saying I had
something to do with this?

48:16.317 --> 48:17.453
You tell me.

48:21.556 --> 48:23.890
The fuck you standing there?

48:23.892 --> 48:25.491
Go check on my money.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.248
Hey, stop!

49:22.250 --> 49:23.482
Get the fuck outta that car!

49:23.484 --> 49:24.683
Get the fuck outta that car!

49:24.685 --> 49:27.853
You motherfucker, get that fuck
outta that car motherfucker.

49:27.855 --> 49:31.556
I'm gonna fucking kill
you, you motherfucker.

49:31.558 --> 49:33.525
You cock sucker!

49:33.527 --> 49:34.395
Fuck!

49:35.495 --> 49:37.096
Shit!

49:37.098 --> 49:38.931
Who the fuck is this bitch?

49:38.933 --> 49:41.132
Oh no, this
fucking deal is done.

49:41.134 --> 49:44.870
I'm taking my money, you
and these motherfuckers out.

49:44.872 --> 49:45.873
Excuse me?

49:47.274 --> 49:48.540
What was that?

49:48.542 --> 49:50.243
I gotta say it
to you in Jamaican?

49:50.245 --> 49:52.143
I'm not Jamaican,
motherfucker,

49:52.145 --> 49:54.547
and I don't think you know
who the fuck you dealing with.

49:54.549 --> 49:56.415
You ought to be real
careful what you say to me.

49:56.417 --> 49:59.585
I don't care if you're the
reincarnation of Malcolm X,

49:59.587 --> 50:02.154
get the fuck out
of my restaurant.

50:03.658 --> 50:07.225
He's a funny man,
and very stupid.

50:07.227 --> 50:08.162
Hey boss!

50:09.596 --> 50:10.531
Boss!

50:12.033 --> 50:15.600
Some fucking guy just
peeled off with the money.

50:15.602 --> 50:16.604
What?

50:33.187 --> 50:34.453
No, no, no, no, no, no.

50:34.455 --> 50:35.587
Come on,
you little fucker!

50:35.589 --> 50:37.623
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay, okay.

50:37.625 --> 50:39.628
Motherfucker.

50:42.062 --> 50:44.932
Take him to the
fucking freezer.

50:50.571 --> 50:51.937
Get in there.

50:54.642 --> 50:56.074
Where's
my fucking money?

50:56.076 --> 50:57.176
I don't
know!

50:57.178 --> 50:58.176
Oh, you don't know.

50:58.178 --> 50:59.578
Where the fuck is my money?

50:59.580 --> 51:00.946
I don't know.

51:00.948 --> 51:03.616
He's gonna
refresh your memory.

51:03.618 --> 51:04.683
Where's my fucking money?

51:04.685 --> 51:06.085
I don't know!

51:06.087 --> 51:09.224
Come on, refresh
his fucking memory.

51:18.498 --> 51:21.667
Oh yeah, I'm so fucking
tired of this game, okay?

51:21.669 --> 51:23.234
You're gonna tell
me exactly where

51:23.236 --> 51:25.437
my fucking money is, all right?

51:25.439 --> 51:26.240
Huh?

51:27.308 --> 51:30.078
So, did you lose
your voice, huh?

51:31.245 --> 51:32.047
Okay.

51:33.681 --> 51:35.047
Ah!

51:35.049 --> 51:37.083
Ha, next fucking time,
I'm not gonna miss.

51:37.085 --> 51:38.384
Do you understand?

51:38.386 --> 51:39.585
What?

51:39.587 --> 51:40.585
What?

51:40.587 --> 51:41.987
I said...

51:41.989 --> 51:42.989
Okay, okay, listen,

51:42.991 --> 51:44.323
read my fucking lips.

51:44.325 --> 51:45.757
Read my lips!

51:45.759 --> 51:47.696
Do you count to three?

51:49.196 --> 51:50.362
Can you do that, huh?

51:52.265 --> 51:54.232
I think you can.

51:54.234 --> 51:55.069
One,

51:55.770 --> 51:56.705
two...

52:03.777 --> 52:05.714
Where is it?

52:14.721 --> 52:15.788
Dale, finally you pick up.

52:15.790 --> 52:18.690
I got the money, you okay?

52:18.692 --> 52:20.658
So it's you, huh?

52:20.660 --> 52:22.361
Who has my fucking money.

52:22.363 --> 52:23.728
Because of you and
your friend here

52:23.730 --> 52:25.163
that my nephew's dead.

52:25.165 --> 52:26.368
This ends now.

52:28.236 --> 52:29.671
Mikey...

52:31.705 --> 52:33.571
Ah!

52:33.573 --> 52:35.141
You fucking
listening now, huh?

52:35.143 --> 52:38.176
Good, because not in
your worst nightmare

52:38.178 --> 52:39.712
can you imagine what
happens to people

52:39.714 --> 52:42.047
who fuck with my business.

52:42.049 --> 52:44.049
Okay, this is really simple.

52:44.051 --> 52:45.750
You're gonna come here, and
you're gonna come here now

52:45.752 --> 52:49.154
with my money, 'cause
if you don't, he dies,

52:49.156 --> 52:51.156
then you're next,

52:51.158 --> 52:53.458
and we will find you in a blink,

52:53.460 --> 52:55.661
whatever the fuck your name is,

52:55.663 --> 52:59.330
and I really hope that you
know how to do the right thing,

52:59.332 --> 53:01.333
yeah, I think you will.

53:01.335 --> 53:03.536
Your fucking friend
here has 10 minutes,

53:03.538 --> 53:05.538
his life is in
your fucking hands.

53:07.442 --> 53:09.141
I hope your friend knows
how to do the right thing,

53:09.143 --> 53:11.810
'cause if not, you're gonna
end up on that fucking hook,

53:11.812 --> 53:14.480
okay, you fucking piece of shit.

53:14.482 --> 53:15.781
Fuck!

53:15.783 --> 53:18.750
Nobody fucks with me, nobody!

55:26.913 --> 55:30.685
Looks like you made
the right choice, kid.

55:31.919 --> 55:35.623
Your friend here is
gonna be very thankful.

55:36.924 --> 55:39.625
Look, you want your money,

55:39.627 --> 55:40.926
then you can meet
me at the pier.

55:40.928 --> 55:43.728
Excuse me, yeah,
hey, you know what,

55:43.730 --> 55:45.931
that's really, really
cute, but it's not the way

55:45.933 --> 55:47.299
it works, kid.

55:47.301 --> 55:49.634
Well, that's how
it works for me.

55:49.636 --> 55:52.304
So you want your
money, that's my offer,

55:52.306 --> 55:54.739
take it or leave it.

56:01.948 --> 56:04.583
Go get my fucking money.

57:00.640 --> 57:01.843
Good morning.

57:02.977 --> 57:04.245
Good morning.

57:07.515 --> 57:08.850
You're up early.

57:11.852 --> 57:14.719
Yeah,
I thought I'd try

57:14.721 --> 57:16.654
to make you some breakfast.

57:16.656 --> 57:17.725
I see that.

57:21.062 --> 57:22.596
Well, I tried.

57:28.035 --> 57:29.404
I'll get better.

57:33.540 --> 57:34.542
Thank you.

57:42.549 --> 57:45.616
Don't thank me just
yet, you gotta try some.

57:45.618 --> 57:46.752
Oop, it's in my hand.

57:46.754 --> 57:47.756
Here you go.

57:54.728 --> 57:56.060
Crunchy.

57:56.062 --> 57:56.895
That's bad.

57:56.897 --> 57:57.763
No.

58:05.071 --> 58:06.040
Okay.

58:07.707 --> 58:08.841
Funny.

58:12.980 --> 58:15.083
I appreciate the thought.

58:26.926 --> 58:28.796
Maybe we could go out?

58:31.098 --> 58:33.401
Yeah, we should do that.

59:57.116 --> 59:58.018
Hey boss,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.154
we got a problem.

01:00:02.156 --> 01:00:03.858
There's nobody here.

01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:05.560
What?

01:00:09.497 --> 01:00:13.165
There's nobody
here, no car, nothing.

01:00:13.167 --> 01:00:14.201
He's not here.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:19.607
What do you want me to do?

01:00:22.042 --> 01:00:24.208
Give that kid a
couple more minutes,

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.245
and get your ass back here.

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:27.645
Clean up this mess,

01:00:27.647 --> 01:00:31.218
and then we'll track
down my fucking money.

01:00:58.145 --> 01:01:02.147
If your friend don't show
up in 10 fucking seconds,

01:01:02.149 --> 01:01:04.486
it is game over, you got it?

01:01:07.555 --> 01:01:09.223
Whoa, whoa, Jesus.

01:01:11.091 --> 01:01:13.261
I can't believe this shit.

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:20.799
I want the rest of my money,
find that fucking car.

01:01:20.801 --> 01:01:25.237
Boss, the car's parked just
a few spots down from here.

01:01:25.239 --> 01:01:26.074
What?

01:01:30.243 --> 01:01:34.082
Okay, if you don't find
that kid, you're next.

01:01:35.315 --> 01:01:36.982
We don't know anything, we
don't know what he looks like,

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:39.721
we don't know
anything about him.

01:02:00.306 --> 01:02:01.142
Fuck!

01:03:05.339 --> 01:03:07.371
I'm gone, I'll
just fucking leave you there.

01:03:07.373 --> 01:03:08.276
Hey,

01:03:11.377 --> 01:03:12.346
you ready?

01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:18.350
I'm gonna be
glad when this is done

01:03:18.352 --> 01:03:21.152
and I never have
to see you again.

01:03:24.158 --> 01:03:25.226
Move, move.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.830
Which one?

01:03:29.897 --> 01:03:30.698
Which one?

01:03:43.843 --> 01:03:44.711
Let's go.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.183
You fucking move, you die.

01:04:02.995 --> 01:04:04.231
Good luck, kid.

01:04:42.268 --> 01:04:42.967
I'm
sorry that you can't,

01:04:42.969 --> 01:04:45.772
that you can't fucking remember.

01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:50.442
I found this in the
back of my closet,

01:04:50.444 --> 01:04:51.475
in the back of my closet.

01:04:51.477 --> 01:04:52.844
You never told me what happened.

01:04:52.846 --> 01:04:54.045
You never told me what happened.

01:04:54.047 --> 01:04:57.452
It's been a fucking
year, Mikey, move on.

01:05:37.491 --> 01:05:38.522
You never told me what happened.

01:05:38.524 --> 01:05:39.357
Never told me what happened.

01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:40.357
Told me what happened.

01:05:40.359 --> 01:05:41.525
Well I'm sorry that you
can't fucking remember,

01:05:41.527 --> 01:05:42.527
you can't fucking remember,

01:05:42.529 --> 01:05:43.828
can't fucking remember.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:44.962
This way they don't
see your face.

01:05:44.964 --> 01:05:45.931
This way they don't
see your face.

01:05:45.933 --> 01:05:47.498
They don't see your face.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.366
I'm sorry that all I know os
that there was some accident

01:05:49.368 --> 01:05:52.203
was some accident and she's
not even around anymore.

01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:55.373
You never told me what happened.

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:56.540
I found this in the
back of my closet.

01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:57.442
Found this in the
back of my closet.

01:05:57.444 --> 01:05:58.442
The back of my closet.

01:05:58.444 --> 01:05:59.143
Well, I'm sorry that you
can't fucking remember.

01:05:59.145 --> 01:06:00.612
That you can't fucking remember.

01:06:00.614 --> 01:06:02.246
This way they won't
see your face.

01:06:02.248 --> 01:06:05.116
You've gotta get over it.

01:06:05.118 --> 01:06:07.451
Some accident, and she's
not even around anymore.

01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:09.321
Some accident, and she's
not even around anymore.

01:06:09.323 --> 01:06:12.190
Some accident, and she's
not even around anymore.

01:06:22.502 --> 01:06:23.667
Get up!

01:06:23.669 --> 01:06:25.569
Hey man, I'm not fucking
around, what the fuck is this?

01:06:25.571 --> 01:06:28.005
I'm not fucking
around, get up, get up!

01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:40.287
Where is he?

01:06:46.593 --> 01:06:47.962
I don't know.

01:06:50.497 --> 01:06:52.163
I'm fucking
sick of this.

01:06:52.165 --> 01:06:55.165
I
know we're not close,

01:06:55.167 --> 01:06:57.137
but we're still family.

01:07:04.544 --> 01:07:05.613
I don't know.

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:26.531
It's not
about the diamonds

01:07:26.533 --> 01:07:30.203
and the money, it's the
thought that counts.

01:07:32.306 --> 01:07:34.475
Hey Mikey, Mikey.

01:07:39.946 --> 01:07:43.013
I found this in the
back of my closet.

01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:44.549
I forgot I even owned it.

01:07:44.551 --> 01:07:47.355
This way they don't
see your face.

01:08:05.439 --> 01:08:06.437
A kid?

01:08:06.439 --> 01:08:08.573
The kid's having a kid?

01:08:08.575 --> 01:08:10.674
I don't believe it,
congratulations,

01:08:10.676 --> 01:08:12.312
that's wonderful.
