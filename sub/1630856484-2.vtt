01:18.411 --> 01:20.538
So, Dario, you find anything?

01:21.039 --> 01:22.082
<i>Not much.</i>

01:22.874 --> 01:24.918
You got any idea why she shot Alberto?

01:25.001 --> 01:28.171
Because of what he had to do, sure.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.465
<i>Yeah, she had a lot of pride,</i>

01:30.548 --> 01:33.843
<i>but you have no idea
how she moaned when I fucked her.</i>

01:33.927 --> 01:36.012
I made her do everything,

01:36.095 --> 01:37.096
<i>and she liked it.</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:40.892
But once a whore, always a whore.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.061
She was a prostitute?

01:43.144 --> 01:44.854
Of course she was.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.439
Any idea where she worked?

01:46.523 --> 01:49.692
Emilio's. Maybe he knows something?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.152
We'll see.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.073
You find that bitch, Dario,
so I can kill her.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.116
You hear me?

01:56.783 --> 01:58.201
Yes, sir, I'll find her.

02:49.752 --> 02:50.795
Welcome to Miami.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.630
- Thank you.
-  Welcome.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.048
Good to be here.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.718
Come on, we are finally here.

03:00.096 --> 03:00.930
Isa.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.891
I'm glad you're here.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.894
I can't believe it. Look at you.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.979
You haven't aged a day.
You look even younger.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.522
And you, more beautiful.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.483
Well, that's because these are new.
Like them?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.235
Moneymakers.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.653
Better believe it.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.571
Mm.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.614
Where's Arturo?

03:18.197 --> 03:19.741
Well, there he is.

03:19.824 --> 03:20.658
Hello!

03:20.742 --> 03:24.662
Arturo! Get in already.
We don't have time for your bullshit.

03:26.122 --> 03:31.294
I thought it'd be fun to travel
with all these women, but it's been hell.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.380
- Liar. You loved it.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.965
How are you, darling?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.052
Better now.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.803
- Let's get to work?
- To work.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.309
Let's make some space.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.730
If there are steps,
why would I jump?

03:50.813 --> 03:52.232
You can do it.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.734
-  You guys almost fell.
-  Don't be scared.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.319
No, I'm not going to jump.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.612
- One, two, three!
- No.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.406
I won't jump.
If there are stairs, why would I jump?

04:01.199 --> 04:02.033
Arturo!

04:02.617 --> 04:03.826
Hey, Arturo!

04:03.910 --> 04:06.579
- How are you boys doing?
- Good.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.790
Have you boys
been taking care of your mom?

04:08.873 --> 04:09.791
- Obviously.
- Of course.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.125
Yeah? How are you?

04:11.209 --> 04:13.294
- Good. How's Alberto?
- Uh...

04:14.045 --> 04:14.879
Well...

04:14.963 --> 04:19.259
Remember that he went on a trip
after we came to Miami.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.262
-  Mm-hmm, hmm.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.390
Ah!

04:26.975 --> 04:27.976
Hello, hello.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.815
Who are they, Mom?

04:33.898 --> 04:37.151
Stop staring, they're friends from home.

04:37.235 --> 04:41.322
And stop trying to trick Ozzy
into jumping those fucking steps.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.496
What an ugly-looking pool.

04:48.579 --> 04:51.332
No water, how great.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.250
No.

04:52.917 --> 04:56.087
I thought the States were more fancy.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.256
At least it's near the beach.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.173
No.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.301
Hot as shit out here.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.302
Isn't it?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.388
Can we get a beer or something?

05:05.471 --> 05:09.767
I don't "get beer."
I'm Ms. Blanco's pistolero.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.146
Hope you're a lefty.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.525
Next one.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.863
Hello.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.406
How are you?

05:23.489 --> 05:24.449
I'm good.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.493
Mm. Excuse me.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.746
Go ahead.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.955
Yes.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.922
Here it is, boss.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.842
Thank you.

05:47.847 --> 05:48.723
Good work.

05:48.806 --> 05:52.018
Thanks. Beats the shit out
of sucking cock all day.

05:52.101 --> 05:52.935
Very true.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.855
- Here is your key.
- Thank you.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.025
- What a beautiful bracelet, boss.
- Mm.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.402
You're beautiful as well.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.988
Stay out of trouble.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.157
It's okay, no problem.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.619
You'll get your money
as soon as I get paid. Look at him!

06:11.370 --> 06:13.039
Keep them away from my boys.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.709
The boys could learn a thing--

06:19.962 --> 06:20.797
Hello.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.257
What is your name?

06:23.341 --> 06:24.550
My name is Carla.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.718
This way.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.471
What I came here for.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.768
 Miami is
a great southern city, gone to seed.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.648
It used to be Sinatra,

06:39.148 --> 06:40.399
pink Caddies,

06:40.483 --> 06:42.110
tits on the beach.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.030
Now it's just a bunch
of shitty liquor stores,

06:46.114 --> 06:47.782
old Jews in lawn chairs,

06:48.616 --> 06:51.452
and a whole lot of thugs from down south.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.918
We are facing down
this brown wave of crime, Rosa.

06:59.001 --> 07:02.713
Which is why I need you
to be truthful with me.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.383
Tell it straight.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.307
He said he's glad you came in to help.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.185
It's important
for witnesses to come forward.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.648
Any information you've got
may help us solve this crime.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.358
I didn't see anything.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.904
She says that she didn't see anything.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
Well, of course she didn't.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.744
Okay, so you are a... uh, waitress

07:33.828 --> 07:36.330
at El Floridita restaurant,

07:36.414 --> 07:37.665
is that correct, Rosa?

07:37.748 --> 07:41.711
You're a waitress
at El Floridita restaurant, correct, Rosa?

07:41.794 --> 07:44.046
- Yes.
-  She says, "Yes."

07:45.423 --> 07:46.966
Yeah, I got that.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.472
And it is your sense
that there are drug deals

07:52.555 --> 07:54.474
that go on in that back room.

07:55.224 --> 08:00.438
Is it your sense there were
drug deals taking place in the back room?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.734
A lot of things were happening back there.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.695
There were
a lot of things taking place.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.948
Who did you see go into the back room
on the day of the murders?

08:11.032 --> 08:14.869
Who did you see go into
the back room on the day of the murders?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.289
There was a woman.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.294
What?

08:23.836 --> 08:24.837
What was that? What?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.216
She said that there was a woman.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.594
With men?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.971
-  With men?
- Yes, with two men.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.598
Yeah, with two.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.099
So, a girlfriend?

08:37.183 --> 08:41.312
Let's hope you're not
a total waste of fucking time there, Rosa.

08:42.313 --> 08:46.400
Any of these <i>muchachos</i>
ring a bell there, <i>mamacita?</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:53.616
Wasn't so bad, right?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.618
No.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.871
Who am I kidding, he's an asshole.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.834
Don't worry,
I'm the only one here who speaks Spanish.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.586
But you're a cop...

09:05.670 --> 09:09.799
Just not a detective like him.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.470
They call me an "Intelligence Analyst."

09:15.346 --> 09:16.639
Is this your first?

09:17.473 --> 09:19.392
No, I have another one.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.602
Nine.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.563
- Me too.
- Yeah?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.148
-  But my boy is 12.
-  Uh-huh?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.317
And he doesn't stop eating.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.530
Hey, Rosa.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.910
I noticed you hesitated when Jensen said

09:37.994 --> 09:40.663
the woman you saw
at Floridita was not a girlfriend.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.166
She didn't walk
like a woman who's a girlfriend.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.835
- Really?
- Hmm.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.753
How'd she walk?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.214
Like a boss.

09:53.676 --> 09:58.347
Ten kilos at $25,000 a key.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.851
That's 250K.

10:02.893 --> 10:07.148
One load every month,
three million a year.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.441
A toast.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.652
- Arturo.
- No, no.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.948
I remember very clearly
my friend being told

10:16.032 --> 10:18.534
many times
she could never do this on her own.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.163
- Thank you.
- And now look at you.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.248
And to my brave Arturo.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.252
I'll never forget you
covering for me with Fernando.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.214
And flying with all those women.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.928
Ah.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.889
Well, speaking of Fernando,

10:39.972 --> 10:43.726
what are we going to do with him
now that you decided not to disappear?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.519
You have to be ready for him.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.855
I will be.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.192
He's got Dario looking for you.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.571
Dario.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.116
Mm.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.752
 You ever hear anything from a girl
who used to work for you, Griselda Blanco?

11:11.045 --> 11:11.921
Maybe.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.091
Bastard.

11:16.133 --> 11:16.967
How about now?

11:19.970 --> 11:21.305
Been a long time.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.474
But last week, she called.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.975
What about?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.394
No fucking clue.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.270
Just heard the girls talking.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.564
Next thing I know,
a dozen of 'em took off.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.525
A dozen girls left?

11:32.608 --> 11:34.443
- Like you heard.
- Where?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.570
I wish I knew, man.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.488
I wish.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.282
Fucking costing me a fortune.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.787
But these bitches love keepin' secrets.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.502
What?

11:53.629 --> 11:59.468
Hey, man. It's fresh, so fresh. Seventeen?

12:01.345 --> 12:02.513
Hey, ladies.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.851
- Welcome to paradise, my king.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.896
Any of you know Griselda Blanco?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.442
Griselda?

12:16.110 --> 12:16.944
Why?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.447
Who's asking?

12:21.198 --> 12:22.241
An old friend.

12:22.324 --> 12:27.288
I haven't seen her in a while,
and I want to get back in touch.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.498
Anyone here maybe know where she is now?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.168
Hmm.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.128
A friend.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.756
Not as far as I know.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.550
Yeah.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.803
You?
You work with her back in the day?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.930
With that bossy bitch?

12:45.639 --> 12:49.268
She's just jealous. Pure envy.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.188
Jealous of Griselda?

12:52.897 --> 12:53.981
-  Mm-hmm.
- How?

12:54.732 --> 12:55.566
Why?

12:55.649 --> 12:58.944
- Griselda taught herself to counterfeit.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.156
Worked her way out of here.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.033
You don't say.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.786
Like she never could.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.040
I heard her husband rescued her.

13:12.041 --> 13:12.875
The husband?

13:15.836 --> 13:17.546
- Listen to him.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.424
Who said that? Hmm?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.718
A man tell you that?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.387
That's bullshit.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.806
Griselda did it all on her own.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.684
Good for her.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.478
Good for me too.

13:33.187 --> 13:37.191
Tell me about yourself.
What do you like, you got any hobbies?

13:37.274 --> 13:40.194
Actually, she's more my type.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.990
What a shame. No?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.327
It's your loss.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.509
Look, I just need some information.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.055
It sounds like you're the only one here
who didn't like Griselda.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.473
Hmm?

14:11.350 --> 14:16.355
Your boss said some of the girls
went to see her last week.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.399
Any idea where?

14:20.568 --> 14:22.403
I liked her more than that.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.498
Where did she go?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.419
They went to Miami.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.305
Stop that! And turn it down!

14:49.388 --> 14:50.222
Okay!

15:04.820 --> 15:07.031
Madam, she needs you.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.247
What's up?

15:15.331 --> 15:18.417
I came to see how
the house hunting's going. Find a place?

15:19.627 --> 15:20.753
Not yet.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.547
You're probably too busy
setting up another coke deal.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.883
That's what's in the suitcase, right?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.509
What, you put that lump in a suit

15:27.593 --> 15:29.929
and had him buy
15 round-trip tickets for Medellín?

15:30.012 --> 15:30.846
Carmen.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.140
I'm an idiot,
I should have known it was you.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.727
Instead, I'm waiting for you
to convince me you're out of the life.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.312
An opportunity came up, so I had--

15:38.395 --> 15:39.605
An opportunity good enough

15:39.688 --> 15:42.733
for you to forget the shit show
you just got away from,

15:42.816 --> 15:44.318
or was that a lie too?

15:44.401 --> 15:48.072
It was the truth. But it's a chance
for us to make the kind of money--

15:48.155 --> 15:49.156
Us?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.326
I'm going to need more plane tickets.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.828
You're gonna have to find
another travel agent,

15:54.912 --> 15:57.623
because I want the fuck out of this.
This shit is insane.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.584
We're over-the-hill ex-wives
of fucking drug dealers.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.794
I know what I'm doing.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.922
Don't buy plane tickets
from me again, okay?

16:06.048 --> 16:08.926
Never should have let you
anywhere near my business.

16:09.009 --> 16:12.262
Carmen, come on. Your business
won't survive without this money.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.349
You're gonna get caught,
Griselda, or worse,

16:15.432 --> 16:19.019
and I don't want to be around to see it,
or what happens to your kids.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.921
Go ahead.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.177
This way.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.280
Hello.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.782
Please try one.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.703
From a Persian in Palm Beach.
Also happens to have excellent hash.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.621
Thank you.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.666
This is Arturo.
He helped me bring the product.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.251
-  Oh.
- Hi.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.172
-  Good to meet you.
-  Nice to meet you, sir.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.217
So, I have it all. Ten kilos.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.927
Oh, the modern woman.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.931
Used to sell makeup door-to-door.
Now it's smuggling coke.

17:38.015 --> 17:41.560
- Ten kilos 25 grand, $250,000 total.
-  Hmm.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.358
Well, I'm not buying your coke.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.194
Excuse me?

17:51.987 --> 17:53.405
You see this dog over here?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.742
That's Papo Mejia.
He's my current supplier.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.745
Now, he and I had
a little disagreement over price, right?

17:59.828 --> 18:01.038
I think you settled it, right?

18:01.121 --> 18:03.165
Yes, she did.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.377
I told him a woman offered me
better product at a lower price, and, oh...

18:07.461 --> 18:09.171
That did not sit well.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.632
- You fucking used me.
-  Uh-uh, free market.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.884
This happens
when you fuck with a man's living.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.052
You did try to fuck him.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.970
Go back to being a housewife

18:17.054 --> 18:19.056
or a stewardess
or whatever the fuck it is you do.

18:20.682 --> 18:25.020
I worked my ass off to bring
that coke here based on your word.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.647
We had a fucking deal.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.525
I'll take it off your hands.
What do you say 5,000 a key?

18:29.608 --> 18:31.902
That's not even
a quarter of what it's worth.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.822
What are you going to do with it?
Bake a cake?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.032
Fuck you and your monkey. Neither of you--

18:37.116 --> 18:39.451
-  The fuck did you call me?
- Calm down.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.995
This bitch
can't mouth off in here like that.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.539
Griselda, we should go.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.586
You go when he says.

18:54.424 --> 18:58.470
Now, most people would take your coke
and dump your body in the bay,

18:59.221 --> 19:01.890
but lucky for you, I'm a gentleman.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.477
I'm going to tell every dealer
in Miami not to touch it.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.522
And you'll be back.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.733
Hey, hey, hey.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.777
Let's go.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.207
You heard what he said?

19:28.041 --> 19:30.711
That coke's worthless if we can't sell it.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.256
We might as well have a suitcase
filled with baking soda.

19:37.426 --> 19:41.305
A lot of fucking good that'll do
when Dario catches up to me.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.244
-  Let's see what happens.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.083
June.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.045
Headlights are on.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.009
Seriously, Martin?
You really think that's funny?

20:19.092 --> 20:21.511
Turning up the AC so my nipples get hard?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.474
Well, at least mine still get hard.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.048
A woman, huh?

20:58.131 --> 21:00.008
The waitress said, she saw a woman,

21:00.092 --> 21:01.718
who's clearly not a girlfriend.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.930
And there's a cigarette
from the back room with lipstick on it.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.392
A cigarette?

21:08.475 --> 21:11.436
From the ashtray at the table,
where the men sit to make the deal.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.065
As opposed to the one to the side
where the girlfriends are usually parked.

21:15.816 --> 21:19.278
Our witness likes me, because I actually
listened to her, unlike Jensen.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.698
Yeah, well,
Billy is a little bit of a cracker.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.659
But these Latin dealers, June.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.620
No woman's making deals,
let alone shooting anyone.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.998
You know that where you come from.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.668
Maybe she's a witness
that can help us find the shooter?

21:34.751 --> 21:37.963
Look, June, this is Jensen's case.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.259
Your job is just to gather intelligence
and put it in a memo.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.807
Sir, have you ever read any of my memos?

21:49.891 --> 21:50.726
Sure.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.686
They're great.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.408
<i>♪ Baby, it's been so lonely ♪</i>

22:07.159 --> 22:09.161
<i>♪ Since I've been away from you ♪</i>

22:10.412 --> 22:13.874
<i>♪ And honey you know
I've been sitting at home ♪</i>

22:13.957 --> 22:17.336
<i>♪ Being lonely too ♪</i>

22:17.419 --> 22:20.130
<i>♪ I can almost taste your sweet lips ♪</i>

22:20.213 --> 22:23.050
<i>♪ And I'm still
A hundred miles from home ♪</i>

22:33.393 --> 22:34.352
Hey.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.147
How long are we gonna sit here?

22:37.773 --> 22:40.108
I could be home making real money.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.110
Give her time, she'll pay.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.863
- Is that so?
- I promise.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.281
Calm down.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.241
Patience.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.421
Come in.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.310
Girls asking about being paid?

23:18.855 --> 23:20.524
Don't worry about that.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.026
Okay.

23:24.694 --> 23:29.491
I'll focus on the boys I have to feed
and the fucking coke I can't sell.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.287
Shit, these are nicer
than the ones in my room.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.415
They're mine. I'll give you a set.

23:48.468 --> 23:51.263
Last time we did this was between johns.

23:53.431 --> 23:55.600
So we're back where we started.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.854
Fucked one way or another.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.155
You know this is the first time
I've ever left Medellín?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.114
Hmm.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.742
And all I've seen is this shitty rat trap?

24:15.036 --> 24:17.247
Remember how we used to blow off steam?

24:17.330 --> 24:18.999
We'd have a good time.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.418
Come on, let's go out.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.132
The last thing
I want to do right now is party.

24:28.758 --> 24:32.596
Griselda Blanco's best out there living.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.183
Not in here,
staring at the fucking ceiling.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.811
I don't care
how nice the fucking sheets are.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.193
We do have a lot of coke.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.489
Why do I have to?

24:51.573 --> 24:54.284
There are some things
you gotta do even if you don't want to.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.662
- But I hate playing catcher.
- I know, but you can't just quit.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.206
You and Dad quit being married.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.755
Look, we decided
that it was better this way.

25:07.672 --> 25:08.798
Which happens in life.

25:09.382 --> 25:13.720
But there are some things
that you gotta do, no matter what.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.641
Like, my job,
which I really have to get back to.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.142
Mm, kiss.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.188
-  Your gun's in the glove box.
- I know where my gun is.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.233
Yeah, just like the car keys
the TV remote, the big salad bowl--

25:26.316 --> 25:28.235
Okay, I get it, Eric.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.448
- I'm sorry it's--
- A long day.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.116
I know.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.925
Smart aleck.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.390
You sure
these people are even alive?

25:58.473 --> 25:59.641
They look dead.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.726
You wanted fancy.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.146
Fuck it.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.899
Like the good old days.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.491
Let's go rescue them.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.290
Let's go.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.804
<i>You get the idea.
We're not playing around.</i>

27:20.930 --> 27:22.015
I have a plan.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.769
Thank God,
because we're sitting ducks here.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.811
Hey--

27:26.895 --> 27:29.105
Assuming they get past you, Chucho.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.817
- What do we do?
- We get more cocaine.

27:36.529 --> 27:39.449
- More than the ten kilos we can't sell?
- Much more.

27:39.532 --> 27:42.702
And how exactly
do we pay for this motherlode?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.245
We don't.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.331
We get a float from Panesso.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.543
Darling.

27:51.336 --> 27:55.340
I paid Panesso for this coke
and he was a grade-A dick about it.

27:55.423 --> 28:00.261
- Why the fuck would he front you product?
- Because you're going to get him up here.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.014
And I'll show him
the potential of my idea.

28:03.098 --> 28:07.352
And he'll want in. Trust me.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.065
This is the country of dreams.

28:12.148 --> 28:15.985
I know you felt it
when you got off that fucking plane.

28:16.069 --> 28:19.989
That sensation that it can all be yours.

28:20.073 --> 28:24.994
That feeling is more powerful
than love, money, anything.

28:25.745 --> 28:30.542
But it turns out there are people here
whose dreams have already come true.

28:31.751 --> 28:35.171
<i>And when your dreams come true,
you lose something precious.</i>

28:35.713 --> 28:38.800
<i>The feeling that comes with something new.</i>

28:39.717 --> 28:41.052
<i>With the unexpected.</i>

28:42.345 --> 28:44.097
<i>The people I'm talking about</i>

28:45.765 --> 28:46.933
<i>are white.</i>

28:48.184 --> 28:49.352
<i>And they're rich.</i>

28:50.937 --> 28:53.648
<i>Those sons of bitches
that have everything.</i>

28:55.024 --> 29:01.781
They represent a huge, untapped market
no one's ever thought to touch.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.491
And in this suitcase

29:04.951 --> 29:09.998
we have the power to bring the excitement

29:10.915 --> 29:13.293
back into their boring lives.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.753
What do we have to do?

29:16.337 --> 29:18.339
Give them a taste.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.094
So they know what it feels like.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.221
Okay.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.099
And how do we do that?

29:28.725 --> 29:29.851
With them.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.980
You're the best saleswomen in the world.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.274
You're not gonna work
in a brothel anymore.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.277
You're going to be working for yourselves.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.613
You'll be making a fuckton of money.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.991
So they're going to sell cocaine?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.368
No, Arturo.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.164
They're going to give it away.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.943
Hello, June.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.486
"On the night of--"

31:04.696 --> 31:07.073
"Among the suspects
at the Floridita murders

31:07.156 --> 31:09.409
is a female drug dealer."

31:09.492 --> 31:13.162
"The simple fact that a woman was able
to operate at this level in this world

31:13.246 --> 31:16.207
makes her a person
of interest in our ongoing efforts

31:16.291 --> 31:18.877
to untangle the Miami narcotics scene."

31:20.545 --> 31:21.421
Huh.

31:22.422 --> 31:26.676
So, I had Horatio keep an eye
on that bitch that tried to snake me.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.511
She's up to some shit.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.974
<i>She called up
all this hot ass from Medellín.</i>

31:33.683 --> 31:35.560
<i>She's got them giving out freebies</i>

31:35.643 --> 31:38.146
to all the rich people
in Coral Gables and Kendall.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.733
On the golf course, at the tennis club,

31:41.816 --> 31:43.735
<i>even at the fucking aerobics classes.</i>

31:44.694 --> 31:47.572
She's showing them
how the powder makes you feel.

31:48.781 --> 31:51.451
She's giving out samples
trying to set up her own market.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.202
Right up the fucking turnpike.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.704
She's wasting her time.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.165
Not to mention her coke.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.542
Sit down.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.838
You know these people,
they don't want to do business with us.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.633
Let alone buy our dirty drugs.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.676
They're gonna wake up wondering

32:08.760 --> 32:11.554
what they were doing
and then they're gonna go on a sail.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.181
And that's all.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.978
I had a cousin
like this woman.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.774
She would always turn up
when you don't expect.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.484
Stirring up shit.

32:24.567 --> 32:28.529
Telling my wife I'm cheating on her,
and you think, "What's the problem?"

32:28.613 --> 32:31.449
"Shit, she's... just a bitch."

32:34.494 --> 32:35.662
But then there she is.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.040
Fucking shit up.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.670
Were you cheating on her?

32:50.176 --> 32:51.719
Going to do something?

32:51.803 --> 32:52.887
Or no?

32:55.556 --> 32:56.641
No.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.520
But I'm not saying you shouldn't.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.315
All right.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.075
German, welcome to Miami.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.619
How was your flight?

33:18.371 --> 33:20.415
Long as fuck.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.336
Hopefully not a waste of time.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.462
Hmm.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.054
Twenty years I've been making
hairy-backed assholes smile.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.390
That one's in his own league.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.058
-  Huh.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.394
German.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.189
Look at how bored these people are.

33:46.399 --> 33:49.235
These people need more than a stuffy bar

33:49.318 --> 33:51.904
and a couple olives
floating in their drinks.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.950
These people need what you have.

33:56.951 --> 33:58.036
Coke.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.912
But they can't get it.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.834
Because they're too scared
to go where it's available.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.921
Which means we have
a thirsty market waiting to be filled.

34:09.839 --> 34:14.093
Griselda, I'm a supplier,
I'm not some street vendor.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.512
That's why we'll make a great team.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.015
Because I'm going
to set up that new market.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.600
And I need your coke.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.685
So you thought what?

34:24.562 --> 34:28.399
"I'm going to bring
this idiot Panesso to a fancy hotel,

34:28.483 --> 34:31.778
dressed up all nice, flatter him,

34:31.861 --> 34:34.489
and he'll give me
everything I want." Yeah?

34:36.949 --> 34:38.034
Remember Medellín?

34:39.327 --> 34:40.369
No, you don't.

34:40.453 --> 34:43.456
Couldn't be bothered
to even spit in my direction.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.958
You and all your asshole friends.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.335
Never gave me the time of day.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.922
And now you bring me here to juice me?

34:52.048 --> 34:53.132
Don't fuck with me.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.304
German, you and I are not so different.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.891
You know where I come from.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.268
The shit I put up with.

35:05.186 --> 35:08.231
You think the Bravos made me feel welcome?

35:08.314 --> 35:12.652
Right, 'cause with those tits
and that ass,

35:12.735 --> 35:15.113
you're some kind of underdog.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.825
We all have our strengths.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.078
But it's the dream,
that's why people come here.

35:22.161 --> 35:24.372
I wipe my ass with the American dream.

35:24.455 --> 35:28.000
And with everyone who convinces themselves
that one day they'll be on top.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.627
A bunch of idiots.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.337
All of us come here deceived,

35:31.921 --> 35:34.715
believing that this
is the land of opportunity.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.136
And when you least expect it,
you've been fucked.

35:40.596 --> 35:41.889
I know you're right.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.852
But I've been screwed over too.

35:46.686 --> 35:52.150
And no fucking way
am I letting this opportunity pass me by.

35:54.110 --> 35:58.239
Just imagine, German,
what you and I can do together.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.783
This ass, these tits, your coke.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.290
- How much we talking?
- A hundred kilos.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.088
Who do I look like, an Ochoa?

36:14.714 --> 36:18.259
You do this,
you won't need another buyer ever again.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.928
That's how big this is going to be.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.096
Big...

36:23.848 --> 36:26.809
All due respect,
you're a fucking housewife.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.187
I don't believe
you could move that kind of volume.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.150
Now get that one-armed idiot
to drive me back to the airport.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.444
German, wait.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.907
I knew you weren't going
to just agree on faith.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.703
I've got
something special planned.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.663
Stay.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.292
I only need one night.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.461
It'll be worth it.

36:57.798 --> 36:58.841
Better be.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.678
I wouldn't even front
100 kilos to my own son.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.474
And I kind of like the fucker.

37:38.881 --> 37:39.799
Mom, it's me.

37:39.882 --> 37:41.092
Come in.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.845
Could I get money for pizza?

37:44.929 --> 37:45.888
Mm.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.729
Well, you know
it's there in case anything happens.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.399
Don't tell your brothers.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.067
Okay.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.029
I'll be back late.

38:02.571 --> 38:05.032
Tell your brothers to pack their stuff.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.286
Tomorrow we're getting out of here.
Going somewhere nicer.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.538
Go, my son.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.127
Hey, yeah.

39:00.546 --> 39:01.380
Isa?

39:01.922 --> 39:04.133
What if
this doesn't work with Panesso?

39:04.633 --> 39:05.551
It will.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.470
- Have some confidence.
- Hmm.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.057
Relax and enjoy the party.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.548
Absolutely. Thank you.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.801
All right, it's a pleasure doing business.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.565
-  How much so far?
- Already sold three keys.

40:02.149 --> 40:03.317
Well, German?

40:03.401 --> 40:06.862
Hell of a party,
but you can't do this every week.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.533
Not everyone
I invited here is rich, German.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.911
Some of them are people
who work for the rich.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.457
Look at him, he's a tennis coach.

40:19.458 --> 40:22.586
And her, she's an aerobics instructor.

40:23.546 --> 40:24.422
A valet.

40:24.505 --> 40:28.592
They've all agreed to be our dealers.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.637
So you can keep selling
to the rich white assholes.

40:33.222 --> 40:34.056
Griselda.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.561
Got a problem outside.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.313
What the fuck?
Get the fuck out of here!

40:41.397 --> 40:43.858
And all you assholes,
go back to the Coconut Grove.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.235
What's your fucking problem?
This is a private party.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.534
I guess bitches work
for bitches, huh, Horatio?

40:54.702 --> 40:56.412
Where's that big mouth boss of yours?

40:56.495 --> 40:58.956
I want to talk to her
about this fucking <i>Love Boat</i> shit.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.374
I'm here, Papo!

41:00.458 --> 41:02.585
What do you want?
You're scaring my guests.

41:06.046 --> 41:09.550
I want for you to forget about all of
this bullshit. Get it out of your head.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.969
A fucking yacht? Really?

41:12.052 --> 41:15.014
This is not Amilcar's territory.
I can do whatever the fuck I want here.

41:15.890 --> 41:16.724
Is that right?

41:18.767 --> 41:23.230
If any of you wine-drinking motherfuckers
buy even a gram of coke

41:23.314 --> 41:27.401
from this fucking bitch, then you're going
to deal with me, Papo fucking Mejia.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.572
Come on, Papo. Is this smart?

41:32.281 --> 41:33.699
To threaten these people?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.285
They're lawyers, they're bankers.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.163
I bet Amilcar isn't here because

41:39.246 --> 41:41.624
he doesn't want
to be close to anything so stupid.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.919
- Don't touch her, motherfucker!
- Hey!

41:45.628 --> 41:49.048
- Maybe I put the next one in her.
-  Let her go.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.384
Come on, motherfucker.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.638
Come on motherfucker, shoot me.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.515
Shoot me in front of all these people.

41:59.058 --> 41:59.892
Hey!

42:03.479 --> 42:04.730
Get the fuck out of here.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.107
Who the fuck are you?

42:08.817 --> 42:09.652
I'm her partner.

42:12.363 --> 42:16.242
Hey, everybody! This fucking asshole
wants to ruin our party.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.788
Motherfucker. Get out of here.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.544
Fuck you!

42:26.627 --> 42:28.629
-  Get out of here!
- Let's get out of here.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.215
-  Go home!
-  <i>Adiós,</i> motherfucker!

42:31.298 --> 42:33.884
Leave us alone, party pooper!

42:41.559 --> 42:42.810
Partners?

42:42.893 --> 42:44.812
You're pissing off the powers that be.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.481
You must be doing something right.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.986
Anyone who can stand up
to that son of a bitch, I want on my side.

42:54.321 --> 42:55.656
A hundred keys a week.

42:56.490 --> 42:57.324
And then--

42:57.408 --> 42:59.159
Sky's the limit.

43:00.869 --> 43:04.123
You keep dreaming, I'll keep making coke.

43:04.915 --> 43:05.833
Partners?

43:31.483 --> 43:34.695
Next trip, I pay double.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.740
What?

43:37.823 --> 43:41.243
Shit, it's like that,
I am done fucking for money.

43:41.327 --> 43:42.411
Mmm.

43:42.494 --> 43:46.040
Gonna be some sad dudes in Medellín?

43:46.123 --> 43:46.999
No way!

43:47.082 --> 43:48.000
Go.

43:49.126 --> 43:49.960
Wait.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.924
- I want you to have this.

43:56.550 --> 43:57.635
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.305
Beautiful.

44:01.388 --> 44:02.389
Thank you.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.183
You will not regret this.

44:04.266 --> 44:05.225
Go.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.773
We've spent enough time
on our back to know what people want.

44:10.856 --> 44:13.275
- Thank God it was good for something.
- Hmm.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.402
See you in two weeks, Isa.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.529
With more girls, more coke.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.948
And it's all ours.

44:24.745 --> 44:25.579
Take care.

44:30.876 --> 44:31.960
Behave badly.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.190
-  Hello?
-  <i>It's me.</i>

44:53.273 --> 44:54.191
<i>We did it.</i>

44:54.274 --> 44:58.570
We didn't get hurt, we didn't get caught,
and we just made a fucking ton of money.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.282
You calling me at 5:00 a.m. to rub it in?

45:02.366 --> 45:04.076
I'm calling because
I'll need more tickets,

45:04.159 --> 45:07.121
and I don't want all that cash
to go to a fucking stranger.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.248
No, it's because
you can't trust them, Griselda.

45:09.331 --> 45:10.749
I know how this works.

45:11.458 --> 45:14.336
<i>All you're after is a source
who won't get you in trouble.</i>

45:14.420 --> 45:18.715
Carmen, come on. I just had a great night,
and I want to share it with my friend.

45:19.716 --> 45:22.886
<i>I help you with your agency,
and you help me bring more girls.</i>

45:22.970 --> 45:24.096
<i>What's wrong with that?</i>

45:24.179 --> 45:25.472
We deserve this.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.058
I don't know, Griselda.

45:28.976 --> 45:29.810
<i>Listen.</i>

45:30.561 --> 45:33.981
In six hours, when I sober up,
I'm going to stop by,

45:34.064 --> 45:36.817
<i>and you're going to sell me
a fucking ton of tickets.</i>

45:38.861 --> 45:40.028
Okay?

45:43.115 --> 45:44.950
Yeah, okay.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.338
Hey, you should be asleep.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.343
Hello, gorgeous.

46:44.426 --> 46:45.886
Uncle Fernando came up to see us.

46:45.969 --> 46:50.849
That's right, my love.
You all left town in such a hurry.

46:51.558 --> 46:53.977
I didn't get to say goodbye.

46:56.355 --> 46:57.189
Come in.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.191
Take a seat.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.945
Boys and I were just catching up a little.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.071
Right?

47:05.989 --> 47:12.538
Now that your mom's here,
there's something I want to know.

47:12.621 --> 47:13.497
Eh?

47:15.582 --> 47:19.294
What reason did your mother give you

47:20.337 --> 47:22.172
for why she left Medellín?

47:23.882 --> 47:26.802
-  Fernando, the boys are tired--
- Shh.

47:26.885 --> 47:29.263
I want to know. I want to know.

47:31.306 --> 47:33.141
What did she say exactly?

47:34.518 --> 47:37.688
Alberto hurt her, so we left.

47:37.771 --> 47:39.815
I see. That's what I thought.

47:39.898 --> 47:41.817
What she told you is bullshit.

47:41.900 --> 47:42.859
Please, Fernando--

47:42.943 --> 47:45.654
Don't you think
your sons should know the truth?

47:45.737 --> 47:46.655
Huh?

47:47.406 --> 47:48.490
I will tell them.

47:49.032 --> 47:55.122
The real reason your fucking mom
left town is she killed Alberto.

47:55.872 --> 47:58.542
- What?
- I thought you said he was on a trip--

47:58.625 --> 48:00.335
- She killed my brother!

48:01.878 --> 48:03.171
What do you think about that?

48:03.255 --> 48:04.464
What would you all do?

48:05.882 --> 48:06.717
Huh?

48:07.217 --> 48:09.928
If one of you were killed,

48:10.012 --> 48:12.848
what would the others do? Huh?

48:14.766 --> 48:18.437
- Don't hurt her, please--
- Sit the fuck down and shut up.

48:20.063 --> 48:23.108
Please, Fernando,
don't do this in front of them.

48:23.191 --> 48:25.402
Don't do this here, my room's next door.

48:26.653 --> 48:28.071
- You want to go to your room?
- Yes.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.282
- Let's go.
- Start walking.

48:33.744 --> 48:34.661
Stay here.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.374
No.

48:40.042 --> 48:42.753
The only thing better than fucking you
will be killing you.

48:42.836 --> 48:44.838
Your brother was a monster, he beat me!

48:44.921 --> 48:47.382
You shot him in cold blood, cunt.

48:48.216 --> 48:50.052
He made me sleep with you!

48:53.555 --> 48:55.724
You killed him because you hated him.

48:55.807 --> 48:57.976
Because he told you,
you were a piece of shit.

48:58.060 --> 49:00.103
- Old slut.

49:00.187 --> 49:03.231
No.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.617
I have to go to the bathroom.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.495
You stay put.

49:25.337 --> 49:26.296
Die.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.342
Die, you fucking whore.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.027
-  Eh?

49:49.111 --> 49:50.487
No.

49:50.570 --> 49:51.822
- Kill him.
-  No.

49:54.074 --> 49:56.159
-  Fucking kill him now.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.015
Everything will be okay.

50:30.569 --> 50:33.113
Go check on your brothers.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.177
Thank you.

51:00.474 --> 51:02.642
Don't thank me. I didn't do it for you.

51:07.731 --> 51:08.857
Then why?

51:14.613 --> 51:15.947
I don't know.

51:17.532 --> 51:18.950
I've never killed a kid.

51:21.620 --> 51:22.871
I've never killed a kid.

51:28.084 --> 51:28.919
This is yours.

51:46.645 --> 51:47.938
What are you gonna do now?

51:57.072 --> 51:58.323
Help me clean this up...

52:02.118 --> 52:03.286
and then we'll talk.
