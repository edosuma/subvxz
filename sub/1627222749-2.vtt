[Jake] <i>What Kevin won't know is that he</i>
<i>will be drinking from a dribble cup.</i>

07:36.372 --> 07:37.623
Oh, dear.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.835
And you said I was crazy to buy stock
in Spencer's Gifts.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.629
How does you buying one novelty cup
help the company's stock price?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.047
It boosts confidence in the marketplace.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.966
You just don't know anything
about business, Terry!

07:47.049 --> 07:48.509
Okay, so we've ruined their outfits.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.219
Why will that "reignite the passion"?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.679
Because it will force them to change

07:51.762 --> 07:53.598
<i>into clothes which I will have</i>
<i>carefully placed</i>

07:53.681 --> 07:55.183
<i>at the top of their suitcases.</i>

07:55.266 --> 07:58.269
Thus changing them both
into a couple of thirst traps.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.771
Kevin Cozner, preparing to
descend the master stairca--

08:00.855 --> 08:05.067
Oh, I see you've changed into your…
mock turtleneck.

08:05.151 --> 08:09.197
And you into your… exercise shorts.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.532
I feel dirty. You feel dirty?

08:11.616 --> 08:14.035
I do. And I love it.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.495
[baby crying]

08:15.578 --> 08:17.330
Oh, hey, Amy. Starting round three.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.707
You wanna try New Mexico-style
Chile Verde?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.542
Uh, my hands are kind
of full here, Scully.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.794
-I can toss it to you.
-Wha--

08:23.878 --> 08:26.422
Scully, don't throw chips at my baby!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.758
Gosh. [sighs]

08:28.841 --> 08:31.594
Ugh. Shh, shh, shh.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.222
[sighs] I can't believe
what I'm about to do.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.557
-Charles, I need your help.
-I'm not gonna gloat.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.976
I'm just happy
he's getting the care he needs.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.062
Okay, you might wanna be
a little less cocky

08:41.145 --> 08:42.522
until after you actually get him down.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.273
Because, you know,
some babies are just fussy

08:44.357 --> 08:47.527
and there's nothing that anyone can--
oh, my God, is he asleep?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.487
[whispering] So can I be cocky now?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.906
Step three: A romantic picnic.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.908
The perfect gill net
for our trout to swim into.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.409
-Huh?
-Sorry.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.786
I've been watching that
survivalist show <i>Alone.</i>

08:56.869 --> 08:58.037
It's really helped with my metaphors.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.705
You think they'll agree to have a picnic?

08:59.789 --> 09:01.415
They won't even be
in the same room together.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.251
It's not like we have
an unbaited gill net, Terry.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.044
What's your plan? Forage for berries?

09:05.127 --> 09:07.171
[laughs] You wouldn't last
two days in the Arctic, man.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.548
What are we doing now?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.757
We're getting Kevin and Holt
back together!

09:09.840 --> 09:11.759
Now for Operation Corn Crake.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.219
Hey, Kevin, I have a question.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.054
Is the corn crake an important bird?

09:15.137 --> 09:16.305
Yes.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.724
They're among the rarest species
in the northeastern United States.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.852
A veritable holy grail
within the bird watching community.

09:21.936 --> 09:22.895
[both] Oh, wow!

09:22.979 --> 09:23.938
I only ask because…

09:24.021 --> 09:26.607
I read that one was spotted
in the woods near here.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.025
[both] Grab your binoculars.
We're going birding.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.569
Yeah, we are.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.529
We're pretty far north for a corn crake.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.947
Where did you hear of this sighting?

09:33.030 --> 09:36.784
Oh, on the birdwatching app that
Captain Holt recommended I download.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.745
You know how he is about birding.
I guess you guys have that in common, huh?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.039
Hardly-- Raymond is an
adequate birdwatcher at best.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.334
He once confused a pileated woodpecker
with a downy woodpecker.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.752
Yeah.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.298
Pileated bootdecker and a pileated jecker.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.799
Huh.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.676
[sighs] It's nowhere.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.138
Uh, maybe you could flush out
the corn crake by doing its mating call?

09:57.221 --> 09:59.974
I don't know why a corn crake
would make such a call

10:00.057 --> 10:05.479
three months after its rooting season,
but I suppose it can't hurt to try.

10:05.563 --> 10:09.191
[imitates bird squawking]

10:10.359 --> 10:11.861
Hold on. That call.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.988
That's the call a corn crake
makes when it wants to root.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.699
I'll respond. [clears throat]

I was being really stubborn earlier,
and I guess what I'm trying to say

13:23.344 --> 13:26.096
is can I please have your nip tips?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.349
You don't want my nip tips,

-I can't tell you, Amy.

-You could stay.
-Oh.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.375

me in both ears right now

if I could get you guys together,

You've been hogging that hedge

No, you didn't have to deal with anyone
saying it was a bad idea,

Are you sure you can be trusted

17:02.771 --> 17:04.523
I can tell you're upset,
but you should know
