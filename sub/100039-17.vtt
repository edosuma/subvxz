<i>Your body contains

00:08.508 --> 00:11.086
<i>and every one of them is

00:11.110 --> 00:12.755
<i>to Earth by gravity.</i>

00:12.779 --> 00:13.789
Look at these losers.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.091
Looks like they're eating
each other's faces.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.994
I once made out through a tornado.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.029
Really?

00:20.053 --> 00:22.836
Went for gum later,
and the 7-Eleven was gone.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.883
And a guitar?

00:25.907 --> 00:27.838
Probably on their way to an open mic.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.105
I play guitar.

00:30.129 --> 00:31.173
That's different.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.008
<i>When you're lying down,

00:36.069 --> 00:38.614
Get a dorm, face-eaters!

00:38.638 --> 00:41.650
Don't they know that
all love sucks eventually?

00:41.674 --> 00:43.852
Too bad there's no sappy love songs about

00:43.876 --> 00:45.220
the part where your husband leaves you,

00:45.244 --> 00:47.056
you cry every time
you see his toothbrush,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.491
so you're living on
your best friend's couch.

00:49.515 --> 00:51.660
Well, stay as long as you want.

00:51.684 --> 00:54.830
It's been perfect, hanging out
and watching bad movies,

00:54.854 --> 00:57.706
trying every dinner
special at Kung Pao's.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.041
It's been nice to think about anything

00:59.065 --> 01:00.275
other than Amelia.

01:00.299 --> 01:02.344
Hear she's back at work,

01:02.368 --> 01:03.378
by the way.

01:03.402 --> 01:05.080
Yeah, I heard that, too.

01:05.104 --> 01:07.349
<i>Stand up too fast,
and blood rushes downward,</i>

01:07.373 --> 01:09.151
<i>away from the brain.</i>

01:09.875 --> 01:12.187
<i>It causes dizziness or even fainting.</i>

01:12.211 --> 01:16.671
So, he moved there, and he's not
coming back to say goodbye?

01:16.695 --> 01:18.085
I don't want to talk about it.

01:18.109 --> 01:19.518
How's Jo?

01:19.542 --> 01:21.366
She's staying with Link for a few days.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.357
Other than that, she doesn't
want to talk about it.

01:23.381 --> 01:25.059
Oof. This is massive.

01:25.083 --> 01:27.115
This is a sea change. How are you?

01:27.618 --> 01:29.730
I don't really want to talk about it.

01:29.754 --> 01:31.098
Ah, right. You're probably not one

01:31.122 --> 01:32.266
to judge someone for leaving town

01:32.290 --> 01:35.069
with no goodbye or return date.

01:36.127 --> 01:37.838
<i>It's a minor miracle
our cells get anything</i>

01:37.862 --> 01:38.928
<i>done at all.</i>

01:38.958 --> 01:40.658
How's Link? Have you spoken to him?

01:41.699 --> 01:43.978
If Link can't love me for me,
no matter who the father is,

01:44.002 --> 01:45.643
then we don't have
anything to talk about.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.481
<i>Because the human body
has to perform even</i>

01:47.505 --> 01:48.900
<i>the simplest of tasks...</i>

01:48.924 --> 01:51.318
I'm guessing you don't
want to talk about that, either.

01:51.342 --> 01:53.454
<i>...under unimaginable pressure.</i>

01:53.478 --> 01:56.423
Well, my mom e-mailed
some venue suggestions... 13.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.659
Planning this wedding
is gonna be a part-time job.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.031
Or a full-time job.

02:00.055 --> 02:01.462
That's why they call it
a wedding planner.

02:01.486 --> 02:02.896
We could hire one.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.099
'Cause you don't want
to plan the wedding?

02:05.123 --> 02:06.967
No, of course... of course I do.

02:06.991 --> 02:08.102
I'm just a little anxious

02:08.126 --> 02:09.203
to check in on one of my patients,

02:09.227 --> 02:10.637
and this elevator just
doesn't seem to want to...

02:10.661 --> 02:13.040
Oh.

02:18.469 --> 02:20.914
You coming or...?

02:20.938 --> 02:22.439
Yep.

02:27.779 --> 02:29.923
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Altman.

02:29.947 --> 02:33.327
Kiddos. You're looking like... kids.

02:33.351 --> 02:34.528
We...

02:34.552 --> 02:36.263
There's a VIP guest today, uh, Hunt.

02:36.287 --> 02:38.132
Uh, Griffin Ford. Tech billionaire...

02:38.156 --> 02:39.767
blew up a rocket over a gas station.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.068
Oh, yeah, thanks for the heads up.

02:41.092 --> 02:43.337
Oh, oh, you betcha.

02:43.361 --> 02:44.805
Will you be visiting the cardio floor?

02:44.829 --> 02:46.540
Depends on how bored he is.

02:47.899 --> 02:50.077
Oh, mm, two more
wedding venues from my mom.

02:50.101 --> 02:51.512
I'll forward them to you.

02:51.536 --> 02:53.814
Maybe it'll help you figure
out what it is you want.

02:53.838 --> 02:55.082
Great. Thanks.

02:55.106 --> 02:56.408
It's important to know what you want.

02:56.432 --> 02:58.552
It's...

02:58.576 --> 02:59.653
Let me know what you think, okay?

02:59.677 --> 03:01.288
Okay, yeah. Love you. Okay.

03:01.312 --> 03:02.489
- You got the kids?
- Yeah.

03:02.513 --> 03:03.757
Okay. Oh! Sorry.

03:03.781 --> 03:04.958
Oh! Hello.

03:04.982 --> 03:05.659
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

03:05.683 --> 03:06.961
Okay.

03:07.085 --> 03:08.685
Okay.

03:10.188 --> 03:11.698
Hey, do you have a minute to discuss

03:11.722 --> 03:13.233
Mr. Paxton's pacemaker?

03:13.257 --> 03:14.252
I do.

03:14.276 --> 03:15.669
Uh, do you want to go get his chart?

03:15.693 --> 03:16.870
Um, sure.

03:16.894 --> 03:18.105
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.263 --> 03:20.574
You're acting weird.

03:20.598 --> 03:21.626
I'm being nice.

03:21.650 --> 03:23.277
Which for you, with Owen, is weird.

03:23.301 --> 03:25.212
My pillow still smells like your hair.

03:25.236 --> 03:26.680
I'm supposed to be mean to the guy, too?

03:26.704 --> 03:28.148
Well, he's gonna know something is up.

03:28.172 --> 03:29.543
Something is up.

03:29.567 --> 03:30.951
I mean, as much as I... as I enjoyed

03:30.975 --> 03:33.420
the... the up-ness of it
and hope it continues,

03:33.444 --> 03:35.255
I think we should take a minute
to discuss what it means.

03:35.279 --> 03:36.523
It doesn't mean anything.

03:36.547 --> 03:39.593
I'm sorry, but I acted
impulsively because

03:39.617 --> 03:42.908
I'm afraid of... something,
which might not even be true.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.574
That wasn't much of an apology.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.610
Tom, you're a good man.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.579
I try to be, but you
haven't been helping.

03:50.572 --> 03:52.116
Hi.

03:52.140 --> 03:53.536
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.021
Uh, so, Mr. Paxton...
his, uh, last X-ray showed a...

03:57.045 --> 03:58.479
Something is happening.

03:58.503 --> 04:00.481
Well, he did have an arrhythmia.

04:00.505 --> 04:03.518
Yeah, I'm not talking about Mr. Paxton.

04:04.041 --> 04:05.152
You asked me if you were crazy.

04:05.176 --> 04:06.921
I said you weren't.
Then I share an elevator ride

04:06.945 --> 04:08.956
with you, and I feel the
need to take a shower.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.591
Okay, fine. I slept with Tom.

04:10.615 --> 04:12.755
What?! No, no, no, no, no!

04:12.779 --> 04:13.589
Don't tell me that!

04:13.613 --> 04:15.024
I thought you were saying that...

04:15.048 --> 04:15.858
I was speculating!

04:15.882 --> 04:17.260
God, talk about a telltale heart.

04:17.284 --> 04:18.761
I know! I know! I feel awful.

04:18.785 --> 04:20.730
I-I panicked, and he was there,

04:20.754 --> 04:22.565
or I went there...

04:22.589 --> 04:24.290
Oh, God, I want to die!

04:26.226 --> 04:27.336
Okay, Mr. Paxton?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.304
I'll cover it.

04:28.328 --> 04:30.340
Great. Thank you.

04:31.965 --> 04:33.076
Oh, no, no, no.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.944
I got it. I got it. I got this.

04:34.968 --> 04:36.512
That is a donation from

04:36.536 --> 04:39.271
the Victoria Hughes apology fund.

04:40.507 --> 04:42.018
I was gonna bake you something.

04:42.042 --> 04:43.386
But...

04:43.410 --> 04:44.754
"Sorry I sorta kinda

04:44.778 --> 04:46.289
moved into your place
without telling you,"

04:46.313 --> 04:47.429
doesn't really fit on a cupcake,

04:47.453 --> 04:50.326
and I wasn't sure you wanted to see me.

04:50.350 --> 04:53.029
I just wanted communication. That's it.

04:53.053 --> 04:54.430
If you need to crash at my place

04:54.454 --> 04:55.731
'cause you're looking for an apartment,

04:55.755 --> 04:56.732
of course you can.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.334
Just maybe ask first.

04:58.358 --> 05:00.436
Yeah. Yeah, well, thanks for the offer.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.242
But I already found
the perfect spot, so...

05:03.266 --> 05:04.373
- Well, good.
- Yeah.

05:04.397 --> 05:05.908
That's good news. What part of town?

05:05.932 --> 05:07.833
Lake Union. Dean's place.

05:09.436 --> 05:10.946
Dean? Really?

05:10.970 --> 05:13.649
Okay, so, he's moved
out of that houseboat?

05:13.673 --> 05:15.885
No, no, no. We're boatmates, I guess.

05:15.909 --> 05:17.753
Or, he just had a kid so technically,

05:17.777 --> 05:19.722
I have two boatmates.

05:19.746 --> 05:22.889
But it's great news, right?

05:23.516 --> 05:26.095
It's, uh... It's news.

05:26.119 --> 05:28.145
That is certainly news.

05:30.824 --> 05:33.402
Um, well, I'm gonna go see Rigo

05:33.426 --> 05:36.172
and give his wife some coffee.

05:36.196 --> 05:38.230
- Okay.
- All right.

05:39.432 --> 05:41.877
It's really good news, Jackson.

05:42.001 --> 05:44.036
It's all good. No worries.

05:45.872 --> 05:48.551
Who... Who sent you?
Look, I-I want a name.

05:48.575 --> 05:49.552
Was it Catherine?

05:49.576 --> 05:50.953
You know, I want to
see that invoice there.

05:50.977 --> 05:52.054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:52.078 --> 05:53.356
- What?
- Uh, uh,

05:53.380 --> 05:55.958
let's just... I'm sorry.
I'm Chief Bailey.

05:55.982 --> 05:56.920
Can I help you?

05:56.944 --> 05:58.030
He's the one who needs help.

05:58.054 --> 06:00.596
Someone sent back my office
furniture from Pac-North,

06:00.620 --> 06:03.099
and I told these guys
that I didn't send for it,

06:03.123 --> 06:05.768
I don't want it,
and they can take it back!

06:05.792 --> 06:07.436
- Whoa, wait, wait!
- Hey.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.437
A-All of it?

06:08.461 --> 06:10.139
Are you planning on sitting on the floor?

06:10.163 --> 06:11.941
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

06:11.965 --> 06:13.876
I have a skills lab to teach.

06:13.900 --> 06:14.911
<i>Dr. Rager to Peds.</i>

06:15.035 --> 06:16.312
<i>Dr. Sara Rager to Peds.</i>

06:16.436 --> 06:18.337
So, we're taking it all back?

06:20.807 --> 06:22.251
Noelle Webb, 43,

06:22.275 --> 06:23.719
complains of abdominal pain and dizziness

06:23.743 --> 06:25.020
after falling off a ladder.

06:25.044 --> 06:27.490
- Hi, Noelle. I'm Dr. Grey.
- Hi.

06:27.514 --> 06:28.691
Did you just lose your balance?

06:28.715 --> 06:30.459
Do you have any other symptoms?

06:30.483 --> 06:34.263
I-I was painting this house,
and I just got woozy for a sec.

06:34.387 --> 06:36.232
Fumes got to me.

06:36.256 --> 06:38.271
I need my phone.
I think it's still at the site.

06:38.295 --> 06:39.368
Okay.

06:39.392 --> 06:41.508
Noelle, we'll get your phone for you.

06:41.532 --> 06:42.638
Ohh.

06:42.662 --> 06:43.839
Do you have any other health issues

06:43.863 --> 06:45.441
that I need to know about?

06:45.465 --> 06:49.044
Oh, I-I'm a type-1 diabetic,
but I take care of it.

06:49.068 --> 06:51.213
You know, I-I-I'm good about what I eat.

06:51.237 --> 06:52.748
- Oh! Oh!
- When's the last time

06:52.772 --> 06:54.350
you checked your blood sugar?

06:54.374 --> 06:56.485
Recently... ish.

06:56.509 --> 06:58.587
Ohh, my Giggle Days rating

06:58.611 --> 07:00.689
is gonna go in the toilet from this.

07:00.713 --> 07:01.736
- Ooh!
- What's Giggle Days?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.592
It's an app for small jobs.

07:03.616 --> 07:05.928
Gig economy. They think they're cute.

07:05.952 --> 07:07.863
Connects you to people who need help

07:07.887 --> 07:10.733
or their Internet hooked up
or their couch moved,

07:10.757 --> 07:13.536
or, in my case, a house painted.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.172
But it's so un-cute
if my rating goes down.

07:16.196 --> 07:17.506
I see some free fluid there.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.608
What's that? Is that bad?

07:19.632 --> 07:22.545
Well, we just need to run
some more tests to make sure.

07:22.569 --> 07:24.847
Dr. Schmitt, let's admit
her for observation.

07:24.871 --> 07:27.483
Get a full set of labs and
order a CT trauma series.

07:27.507 --> 07:28.684
And my phone!

07:28.708 --> 07:31.187
We will ask the paramedics
if they have found your phone.

07:31.211 --> 07:32.746
I'll see you soon, Noelle.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.390
<i>Dr. Daniel to Pediatrics.</i>

07:36.082 --> 07:37.493
Heads up. She may seem nice,

07:37.517 --> 07:39.595
but she just wants a condo on Mars.

07:39.619 --> 07:41.230
Oh, no. No, no, I'll take the kindness,

07:41.254 --> 07:42.765
even if it's insincere.

07:42.789 --> 07:45.234
Most of the people in this
city think I'm a monster.

07:45.258 --> 07:47.536
Well, big company, big accident,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.572
classic clickbait. The firefighter,

07:49.596 --> 07:51.173
Rigo Vasquez, is here recovering.

07:51.197 --> 07:52.775
I know he's eager to
thank you for covering his,

07:52.799 --> 07:53.943
uh, medical expenses.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.711
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Listen, before we, uh...

07:55.735 --> 07:57.646
before we get to that...

08:01.007 --> 08:03.419
This thing is, uh, catastrophic.

08:03.443 --> 08:05.621
My investors are spooked.

08:05.645 --> 08:07.823
"Woke" Twitter is eating me alive.

08:07.847 --> 08:09.124
Well, th... there were no fatalities.

08:09.148 --> 08:11.494
"Billionaire explodes
rocket over Seattle"

08:11.518 --> 08:13.529
is the only thing anyone cares about.

08:13.553 --> 08:16.465
And now there are rumors
of a criminal investigation.

08:16.489 --> 08:19.768
People got hurt on my watch, by my hand.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.670
I made mistakes, Tom.

08:21.694 --> 08:25.341
Mistakes that are... beneath me.

08:25.365 --> 08:27.643
Now, I may fail sometimes.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.579
I was a crap husband, and I suck at golf.

08:30.603 --> 08:32.748
But my critical thinking,

08:32.772 --> 08:35.618
my calculations,
my understanding of physics...

08:35.642 --> 08:37.352
that's never failed me.

08:37.376 --> 08:39.587
Now, I don't know if it's a brain tumor,

08:39.611 --> 08:43.692
some neurological disease,
if it's cancer,

08:43.716 --> 08:49.398
but I need you to find
whatever it is and fix it

08:49.422 --> 08:53.425
before this nightmare wipes
out all the good I've done.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.772
Well, you've come to the right place.

08:56.796 --> 08:59.575
Why don't you text her,
see if she wants to talk?

08:59.599 --> 09:00.643
About what?

09:00.667 --> 09:01.810
The baby that might be Owen's

09:01.834 --> 09:03.546
or the relationship she just ended?

09:03.570 --> 09:05.581
Or the weather? I'll pass.

09:05.605 --> 09:07.616
If she wants to talk to me,
she can find me.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.951
I'm done chasing her.

09:08.975 --> 09:10.553
Okay.

09:13.046 --> 09:14.757
Brad Spencer, 22.

09:14.781 --> 09:17.059
Found unresponsive with
burns on three extremities.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.661
GCS of 6T.

09:18.685 --> 09:21.196
We got him back after
multiple rounds of CPR.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.198
He jumped onto a train
track and got electrocuted.

09:23.222 --> 09:25.568
He didn't jump. He fell. We were kissing.

09:25.592 --> 09:27.369
We were saying goodbye,
and we thought that

09:27.393 --> 09:28.871
the train was still behind us.

09:28.895 --> 09:31.373
Then he turned around
too fast, and he just fell.

09:31.397 --> 09:32.708
Oh, my God! Link!

09:32.732 --> 09:34.510
It's the face-eaters from this morning!

09:34.534 --> 09:35.711
All right, okay, we got to go!

09:35.735 --> 09:37.580
- Trauma one!
- Go, go, go!

09:43.209 --> 09:50.109
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:51.739 --> 09:53.169
Third-degree burns on this arm.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.303
- Head trauma?
- I paged Koracick.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.198
And he's busy. What happened?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.366
Brad fell on his guitar,
which fell on the train tracks.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.868
He was making out with his girlfriend.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.236
I don't have a pulse in either wrist,

10:02.260 --> 10:03.409
and this arm is cold and tight.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.439
- This one, too.
- Okay, right leg's okay,

10:05.463 --> 10:07.508
but I'm not getting
anything in the left foot.

10:07.532 --> 10:08.709
- Compartment syndrome.
- Compartment syndrome, okay.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.511
- Okay.
- Scalpels and sterile gloves!

10:10.535 --> 10:11.679
Simms, you ever done a fasciotomy?

10:11.703 --> 10:13.113
Does a cadaver count?

10:13.137 --> 10:14.857
You and Jo take the arms.
I'll take the leg.

10:16.474 --> 10:18.352
Pupils are equal and reactive,

10:18.376 --> 10:19.887
but I can't rule out a head injury.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.121
He needs a CT ASAP.

10:21.145 --> 10:22.456
After we save his limbs.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.358
Okay, fasciotomies on my count.

10:24.382 --> 10:25.860
One, two...

10:25.884 --> 10:27.394
Wait, wait! Is that her?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.029
She should not see this.

10:31.856 --> 10:34.802
All right, one, two, three.

10:43.535 --> 10:45.145
Do you care if I stand?

10:45.169 --> 10:47.448
Stand, sit, whatever you need.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.250
I don't need to stand.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.452
I just p-prefer to, I guess.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.087
Okay, whatever's more comfortable.

10:55.146 --> 10:56.457
You don't think that's possible?

10:56.481 --> 10:58.192
To be comfortable here?

10:58.216 --> 11:00.628
I think that when your bosses tell you

11:00.652 --> 11:03.163
that you can't operate
until a counselor signs off,

11:03.187 --> 11:05.165
it sort of casts a mood.

11:05.189 --> 11:07.001
Okay, what kind of mood?

11:10.862 --> 11:14.575
Look, our patients were
at extreme risk, all right?

11:14.599 --> 11:15.576
And I keep coming back to the fact that

11:15.600 --> 11:17.878
if I'd behaved differently,
they'd be dead.

11:17.902 --> 11:19.513
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's all it was...

11:19.537 --> 11:21.849
just passion for the work.
Trying to save lives.

11:21.873 --> 11:24.174
It's not some manic, uh, whatever.

11:24.198 --> 11:25.286
I didn't say "manic."

11:25.310 --> 11:27.221
Are you experiencing symptoms of mania?

11:27.245 --> 11:28.322
No.

11:28.346 --> 11:29.990
Agitation, inflated confidence,

11:30.014 --> 11:32.426
rambling, increased sex drive?

11:32.450 --> 11:34.862
N-No. No, none of that.

11:34.886 --> 11:39.600
I just... I've... had a very
stressful couple weeks.

11:39.624 --> 11:41.201
That's all.

11:41.225 --> 11:42.560
Okay.

11:44.295 --> 11:48.209
"Painter left job unfinished,
spilled paint on porch.

11:48.372 --> 11:50.283
Do not hire this person.

11:50.308 --> 11:53.687
Shrug emoji, poop emoji,
thumbs-down emoji.

11:53.712 --> 11:54.890
Zero stars."

11:54.915 --> 11:56.226
I'm sure you can have that removed

11:56.250 --> 11:57.961
if you contact customer service.

11:57.986 --> 12:00.532
You sound like someone
who's never tried to do that.

12:00.557 --> 12:02.401
Schmitt, she should've had a CT by now.

12:02.426 --> 12:03.837
And what's the status on her room?

12:03.862 --> 12:05.259
Apparently there's an
issue with admissions.

12:05.283 --> 12:06.560
A lot of people got moved around.

12:06.584 --> 12:07.528
Some VIP thing.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.530
Do I get some kind of
discount for the wait?

12:09.554 --> 12:11.732
I do have her lab results, though.

12:11.756 --> 12:12.967
Oh.

12:14.726 --> 12:17.404
Whoa. Noelle, these
numbers are kinda high.

12:17.428 --> 12:19.573
Are you taking your insulin regularly?

12:19.597 --> 12:20.708
I'm pretty good about it.

12:20.732 --> 12:22.433
"Pretty good"... what does that mean?

12:23.601 --> 12:24.779
We're not gonna judge you.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.914
I just need to know so
these numbers make sense.

12:26.938 --> 12:28.616
Are you taking your insulin?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.251
Okay, the deal is

12:31.275 --> 12:33.487
I just moved my folks
into assisted living,

12:33.511 --> 12:35.289
and that's not cheap.

12:35.313 --> 12:38.559
I've been working all these
apps trying to make ends meet.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.662
But there isn't always
enough left over for me.

12:41.686 --> 12:45.799
So, um, I've been rationing my insulin

12:45.823 --> 12:48.202
until my situation's more stable.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.070
Unfortunately, that's not how this works.

12:50.094 --> 12:52.054
I'm... I'm sure that's why
you got dizzy and fell.

12:52.997 --> 12:54.608
Dr. Grey, Chief Koracick needs you.

12:54.632 --> 12:55.743
Well, tell him to wait.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.544
He says it's an emergency.

12:57.568 --> 13:01.315
Okay, let's get her a CT,
check on the status of her room,

13:01.339 --> 13:03.250
page me as soon as she gets in.

13:03.274 --> 13:05.019
- Okay.
- Okay?

13:06.244 --> 13:08.689
Dr. Grey. Thank you for coming.

13:08.713 --> 13:10.024
Why's this floor empty?

13:10.048 --> 13:11.525
You said this was an emergency.

13:11.549 --> 13:13.160
Oh, it is. Emergent, uh, consult.

13:13.184 --> 13:15.296
Griffin Ford is here today.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.563
The billionaire rocket guy?

13:16.587 --> 13:19.089
Yeah, maybe don't call him that.

13:20.194 --> 13:21.368
Wait a second. Please don't tell me

13:21.392 --> 13:23.537
you let him buy out this entire floor.

13:23.561 --> 13:24.605
No, of course not. He got it for free.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.165
He's a great friend to the
Catherine Fox Foundation.

13:27.732 --> 13:29.677
The emergency room is overflowing!

13:29.701 --> 13:31.445
Patients need rooms.
My patient needs a room.

13:31.469 --> 13:33.180
Well, all... all the more reason
to get this taken care of

13:33.204 --> 13:34.948
and get him on his... on his way.

13:34.972 --> 13:36.650
Th-This guy is about a lot more than,

13:36.674 --> 13:37.818
uh, spaceships, Grey.

13:37.842 --> 13:40.688
He's working to fight climate
change, uh, end poverty.

13:40.712 --> 13:43.724
And... And I'm pretty sure,
uh, he's... he's single.

13:43.748 --> 13:44.758
Okay, not interested.

13:44.782 --> 13:48.195
Okay, you don't have
to be nice, but be a pro.

13:54.992 --> 13:59.006
Yes. Yes. Good girl, Emmie.

14:01.699 --> 14:03.777
<i>Dr. Mochrie to OR 3.</i>

14:03.801 --> 14:04.678
Hey.

14:04.702 --> 14:06.837
<i>Dr. Julia Mochrie to OR 3.</i>

14:09.640 --> 14:12.419
Teddy, what... what was that?

14:12.443 --> 14:13.654
Oh, I... Well, I just, uh...

14:13.678 --> 14:15.656
I just wanted to take the stairs.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.625
Teddy, what's wrong?

14:17.749 --> 14:20.427
I know you too well.
Something has happened.

14:20.451 --> 14:22.319
Just tell me.

14:29.894 --> 14:32.129
Amelia's baby might be yours.

14:32.930 --> 14:33.974
I mean

14:33.998 --> 14:37.077
Might be, as in might not.

14:37.101 --> 14:37.978
I just...

14:38.002 --> 14:40.488
I don't... I don't think she knows yet.

14:41.939 --> 14:43.317
Jo.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.818
What does Jo have to do with anything?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.220
She mentioned something in surgery.

14:46.244 --> 14:48.222
She said, "What would you do if..."

14:48.246 --> 14:49.890
How do you even know this?
Did Amelia tell you or...

14:49.914 --> 14:50.824
- No.
- Then who?

14:50.848 --> 14:51.925
It doesn't matter. Te... You just told me

14:51.949 --> 14:54.695
that I-I might have another
baby with another woman.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.629
Amelia, your ex-wife.

14:55.653 --> 14:57.131
I need to make sure that you didn't hear

14:57.155 --> 14:58.886
- some rumor and run with it.
- Run with it?

14:58.910 --> 15:00.073
I want to make sure that it's real.

15:00.097 --> 15:01.317
It's real, Owen!

15:01.341 --> 15:02.770
It's a real baby,

15:02.794 --> 15:04.929
and you might really be the father!

15:09.967 --> 15:11.678
If you have a baby with Amelia,

15:11.702 --> 15:14.004
what does that mean for us?

15:14.806 --> 15:16.773
I...

15:17.475 --> 15:19.075
Wow.

15:20.278 --> 15:21.488
Wow.

15:21.612 --> 15:23.257
Wow.

15:23.281 --> 15:24.681
Teddy.

15:30.522 --> 15:32.566
I enjoyed your article.

15:32.590 --> 15:33.767
Which one?

15:33.791 --> 15:35.635
Uh, "The List."

15:35.833 --> 15:38.946
Exposing all those problems
with the healthcare system.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.048
I bet that ruffled some
feathers around here.

15:41.072 --> 15:42.616
We survived.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.220
Reasonable people adapt
themselves to the world...

15:46.244 --> 15:48.188
unreasonable people persist

15:48.212 --> 15:50.558
in adapting the world to themselves.

15:50.582 --> 15:54.495
Therefore, all progress depends
on unreasonable people.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.764
- Huh. Profound.
- Hmm.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.799
The future should ruffle
feathers. Don't you think?

15:58.823 --> 16:01.777
Sometimes your vision demands
that you light the spark,

16:01.807 --> 16:04.405
you storm the palace.

16:04.429 --> 16:06.707
- I've been there.
- Hmm.

16:06.731 --> 16:08.876
You don't agree?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.844
I just find it ironic
that someone who has

16:10.868 --> 16:12.913
a whole hospital floor to themselves

16:12.937 --> 16:14.949
is talking about storming palaces.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.117
I didn't ask for an entire floor.

16:17.141 --> 16:18.018
You didn't have to.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.553
You just asked Catherine Fox for a favor,

16:19.577 --> 16:20.854
and, boom, here you are.

16:20.878 --> 16:23.357
Grey, time to check his thyroid.

16:25.283 --> 16:26.660
Excuse me.

16:26.684 --> 16:28.162
Ooh! Look at that.

16:28.186 --> 16:29.396
My patient's in CT.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.931
Your patient's right here.

16:30.955 --> 16:32.199
He's someone else's patient now.

16:32.223 --> 16:34.335
Mr. Ford, may I introduce you to

16:34.359 --> 16:36.537
- Dr. Jackson Avery?
- Grey.

16:36.561 --> 16:38.606
We're rolling out the
red carpet for Mr. Ford,

16:38.630 --> 16:42.109
and it doesn't get any
redder than Dr. Avery.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.744
Wh... What's going on?

16:43.768 --> 16:46.303
Your mom, your mess.

16:49.273 --> 16:50.884
Brad's electrocution injury

16:50.908 --> 16:52.019
affected the tissue in his limbs.

16:52.043 --> 16:55.255
We had to cut through
both of his arms and his leg

16:55.279 --> 16:57.157
to preserve the circulation.

16:57.181 --> 16:59.259
Still, the damage was extensive.

16:59.283 --> 17:02.129
His head CT shows a small
epidural bleed in his brain,

17:02.153 --> 17:03.697
which I'll evacuate in the OR.

17:03.721 --> 17:05.499
It could have been a lot worse.

17:05.522 --> 17:06.867
We think that the neck of his guitar

17:06.891 --> 17:08.039
took most of the impact.

17:08.063 --> 17:09.403
It probably saved his life.

17:09.426 --> 17:11.704
Wow.

17:11.729 --> 17:13.440
One second, he was there,

17:13.464 --> 17:17.077
and then he just disappeared
like he fell through a trapdoor.

17:17.101 --> 17:19.646
You didn't hear the train leaving?

17:19.671 --> 17:22.215
We... We just graduated from U-Dub,

17:22.240 --> 17:26.319
and Brad got this internship
at a music studio here.

17:26.344 --> 17:30.391
But I won a Rhodes Scholarship,
and he's been so sweet,

17:30.415 --> 17:33.360
singing me these corny love songs.

17:33.384 --> 17:35.229
But it's been torture just knowing that

17:35.253 --> 17:36.730
we were gonna be apart.

17:36.754 --> 17:38.699
And I was on my way to the airport today,

17:38.723 --> 17:41.168
and he just got this look on his face

17:41.192 --> 17:45.172
and... and he said, "Screw it.
Let's go to England together."

17:45.196 --> 17:47.341
And then he kissed me, and it was like...

17:47.365 --> 17:49.266
everything was solved.

17:50.234 --> 17:53.714
Not even the "ding-ding"
of the doors closing?

17:53.738 --> 17:55.916
The annoying loudspeaker?

17:55.940 --> 17:58.752
Okay, uh, we are gonna
take Brad to the OR

17:58.776 --> 18:00.719
and then move him to the ICU.

18:00.743 --> 18:02.322
We will let you know
if we have any updates.

18:02.346 --> 18:04.481
Okay.

18:07.518 --> 18:08.961
What are you doing here?

18:08.986 --> 18:10.998
I wasn't sure if you could leave,
so I paged everyone.

18:11.022 --> 18:13.680
There's a guy up there with
the entire floor to himself.

18:13.704 --> 18:15.716
Meanwhile, this woman
is rationing her insulin

18:15.740 --> 18:17.050
just to stay alive.

18:17.074 --> 18:18.074
It's infuriating.

18:19.443 --> 18:21.088
Oh. Scans are up.

18:21.212 --> 18:22.856
Big retroperitoneal bleed.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.424
Kidney's shattered. She needs an ex-lap.

18:24.448 --> 18:25.992
Let's book the OR.

18:26.016 --> 18:28.095
And if any billionaire
tries to get in your way,

18:28.119 --> 18:30.186
push them aside.

18:32.423 --> 18:33.667
Are you okay?

18:33.692 --> 18:35.436
Huh? Uh...

18:35.559 --> 18:36.670
Have you talked to Amelia?

18:36.694 --> 18:37.637
About...?

18:37.661 --> 18:39.005
Help! I need help!

18:41.932 --> 18:42.943
BP's dropping.

18:42.967 --> 18:44.244
Abdomen's more distended.

18:44.268 --> 18:45.612
Let's get an intubation tray.

18:45.636 --> 18:47.203
Book the OR.

18:49.807 --> 18:51.952
Hey, I got your page. What's wrong?

18:51.976 --> 18:55.545
Let's talk in your office.

19:01.619 --> 19:02.852
Ta-da!

19:03.554 --> 19:05.465
What the hell did you do?

19:05.489 --> 19:08.135
What? I had the movers
bring up your old furniture

19:08.159 --> 19:10.704
from the basement and
arrange it like it was before.

19:10.728 --> 19:12.308
Look, I-I know

19:12.332 --> 19:14.199
you're still feeling down

19:14.223 --> 19:16.276
about Catherine and everything else.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.669
So o-of course you didn't
want that Pac-North stuff.

19:20.758 --> 19:24.438
You think you know what
I want and what I don't want?

19:24.463 --> 19:26.142
I never wanted this
furniture moved in here

19:26.166 --> 19:27.643
in the first place!

19:27.668 --> 19:28.989
And it came anyway!

19:29.013 --> 19:30.490
And if I had wanted this old junk back,

19:30.514 --> 19:31.958
I would have asked for it!

19:31.982 --> 19:34.328
Look, I want an empty room!

19:34.352 --> 19:36.653
Why is that so hard to understand?!

19:38.148 --> 19:39.826
You know, you're just like her.

19:39.851 --> 19:41.762
You presume to know what's best!

19:41.787 --> 19:43.731
Okay! Okay.

19:43.756 --> 19:45.634
It's an easy fix. Ri... I d...

19:45.659 --> 19:48.205
I'll just call building
services and right...

19:48.230 --> 19:49.574
Ah.

19:49.599 --> 19:50.742
Okay, apparently,

19:50.767 --> 19:53.413
Tom Koracick has decided to
wreak havoc on the hospital.

19:53.438 --> 19:56.517
Look, I-I'll come back, and I'll fix it.

19:56.542 --> 19:59.121
Don't bother! I'll do it myself!

20:14.171 --> 20:16.326
Hey, I texted. You didn't reply.

20:16.350 --> 20:19.129
Uh, yeah, I got stuck
helping babysit a billionaire.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.636
It screwed up my entire schedule.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.504
You should go enjoy your day off, though.

20:23.528 --> 20:25.406
You know, I can swing by the boat later.

20:25.430 --> 20:28.343
Maybe I can bring a housewarming
present for you and Dean.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.634
Jackson. Jackson, hey.

20:31.636 --> 20:32.947
What's up?

20:32.971 --> 20:34.115
I move in, you're mad, and I move out,

20:34.139 --> 20:35.183
and you're still mad.

20:35.207 --> 20:37.585
So, what... If you have
a problem, just tell me.

20:40.011 --> 20:41.089
Please.

20:41.113 --> 20:42.646
Okay.

20:45.517 --> 20:48.863
Look, I know you and Dean are friends.

20:48.887 --> 20:49.664
- Okay, I get that.
- Mm-hmm.

20:49.688 --> 20:51.399
I also think he has
a thing for you, so...

20:51.423 --> 20:52.633
What? No, he doesn't.
He doesn't have a...

20:52.657 --> 20:54.469
He also hit on Maggie
when we were together,

20:54.493 --> 20:56.204
so I kind of question his whole...

20:56.228 --> 20:57.839
Oh, you don't need to question anything.

20:57.863 --> 20:59.274
He didn't know she had a boyfriend,

20:59.298 --> 21:00.475
and when he did, he backed off.

21:00.499 --> 21:02.343
And then he invited you to live with him.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.611
No, no, he did not...

21:03.635 --> 21:04.779
He did not invite me. I asked.

21:04.803 --> 21:06.457
Which somehow makes it worse, okay?

21:06.481 --> 21:08.153
- It...
- Not... You live with him now.

21:08.177 --> 21:10.323
You're raising a baby
together, all right?

21:10.347 --> 21:11.424
You haven't even met my child.

21:11.448 --> 21:12.725
You haven't invited me to meet her.

21:12.749 --> 21:13.993
'Cause we're not there yet!

21:14.017 --> 21:15.661
Then where are we?!
Because it sounds like

21:15.685 --> 21:17.130
we're in the place where you freak out

21:17.154 --> 21:19.198
when I get too close
and when I live my life.

21:19.222 --> 21:20.193
So pick a lane.

21:20.217 --> 21:21.534
Look, I don't want to fight with you.

21:21.558 --> 21:23.002
- Well, I do!
- I'm at work.

21:23.026 --> 21:24.537
I have a VIP patient to deal with.

21:24.561 --> 21:25.638
So I'd like us...

21:25.662 --> 21:28.040
...to be able to talk
about this completely later.

21:28.064 --> 21:29.475
You know, I'm sorry. If you can't answer

21:29.499 --> 21:30.877
the simple question of where we are,

21:30.901 --> 21:32.645
I'm not sure we have
that much left to talk about.

21:32.669 --> 21:33.913
Oh, you know what? Come on, okay?

21:33.937 --> 21:35.982
You don't get to suddenly
dictate the timeline.

21:36.006 --> 21:38.484
You made choices that
I was not involved in.

21:38.508 --> 21:39.986
Give me a second to process.

21:40.010 --> 21:42.188
Process what? That I have friends?

21:42.212 --> 21:44.156
Okay, all right, yeah.
You have your process.

21:44.180 --> 21:46.059
Let me know how it goes.

21:47.651 --> 21:49.695
We'll need to page Avery post-op

21:49.719 --> 21:51.731
to take a look at these
wounds for closure later.

21:51.755 --> 21:52.965
Hematoma drained.

21:52.989 --> 21:54.300
He's lucky that guitar didn't jam

21:54.324 --> 21:55.668
straight into his brain.

21:55.692 --> 21:57.100
It was a cheap guitar.

21:57.124 --> 21:59.272
So much for dumb love songs.

21:59.296 --> 22:01.574
What is wrong with making out in public

22:01.598 --> 22:04.343
and singing to each other
un-ironically, saying,

22:04.367 --> 22:05.344
"Screw it... let's go have an adventure"?

22:05.368 --> 22:07.546
Isn't that what being
22 and in love is for?

22:07.570 --> 22:10.950
Yeah, until the part where
you get cooked on a train track.

22:10.974 --> 22:12.618
Word.

22:12.642 --> 22:14.120
Hmm. I'm done here.

22:14.144 --> 22:16.407
Do you two need help
dressing those wounds?

22:16.431 --> 22:17.523
No, I think we got it from here.

22:17.547 --> 22:19.458
Yeah, and we're good
to update the girlfriend

22:19.482 --> 22:21.627
if you have somewhere you need to be.

22:26.556 --> 22:28.501
"Word"? Really?

22:28.525 --> 22:30.169
I know.

22:30.193 --> 22:31.237
I'll be right with you guys, okay?

22:31.261 --> 22:33.739
Hey, Chief! Uh, I think
I got the overflow handled.

22:33.763 --> 22:34.674
So...

22:34.698 --> 22:36.642
DeLuca, telling me you're doing your job

22:36.666 --> 22:37.777
isn't a part of doing your job.

22:37.801 --> 22:39.512
Right, but I just thought now
that that's taken care of,

22:39.536 --> 22:40.880
I could maybe start
treating some of the patients

22:40.904 --> 22:42.748
- that I've been moving?
- Oh, that isn't our deal.

22:42.772 --> 22:44.583
Look, I've been seeing
the counselor, all right?

22:44.607 --> 22:45.818
I did that. And now with Dr. Webber

22:45.842 --> 22:48.754
handing off his entire service,
I just thought I could help.

22:48.778 --> 22:51.157
Webber handed off his entire service?

22:51.181 --> 22:52.466
- Why?
- You know what?

22:52.490 --> 22:54.427
I don't really know because
gossip isn't a part of my job.

22:54.451 --> 22:56.495
I'm a surgeon. Please,
Chief, let me work.

22:56.519 --> 22:57.530
This... This...

22:57.554 --> 22:58.497
Chief? Is that a yes?

22:58.521 --> 23:00.333
It is not.

23:04.661 --> 23:06.238
I can't find the bleeding. She's in DIC.

23:06.262 --> 23:07.473
Can we control it with a REBOA?

23:07.497 --> 23:08.499
She's lost too much blood.

23:08.523 --> 23:10.109
She couldn't afford her insulin.

23:10.133 --> 23:11.077
She was healthy.

23:11.101 --> 23:12.445
She was doing everything
she needed to do.

23:12.469 --> 23:13.946
She was taking care of her parents.

23:13.970 --> 23:15.514
She had her whole life ahead of her.

23:15.538 --> 23:17.323
This shouldn't have happened!

23:20.543 --> 23:22.588
<i>Dr. Crone to Peds ICU.</i>

23:22.712 --> 23:25.024
<i>Dr. Alexandria Crone to Peds ICU.</i>

23:25.048 --> 23:26.482
Hey.

23:27.784 --> 23:29.391
I told Owen.

23:30.253 --> 23:33.299
Okay, did he... Should someone warn Tom?

23:33.323 --> 23:35.534
No, not about that.

23:35.558 --> 23:37.703
About the baby, about Amelia's baby.

23:37.727 --> 23:39.338
I told him because she wouldn't

23:39.362 --> 23:40.406
and he deserves to know,

23:40.430 --> 23:44.009
and I deserve answers,
and Link deserves answers,

23:44.033 --> 23:45.978
and, I mean, who does this?

23:46.002 --> 23:47.546
Who gets this far into the pregnancy

23:47.570 --> 23:49.048
and just toys with people's feelings,

23:49.072 --> 23:50.449
with... with their lives?

23:50.473 --> 23:52.084
I was just starting to really like her.

23:52.108 --> 23:55.788
And I was just starting
to really like you.

23:55.812 --> 23:56.922
I mean, who does this?

23:56.946 --> 23:58.057
Who cheats on her fiancé

23:58.081 --> 24:00.860
with a man who is clearly
desperately in love with her?

24:00.884 --> 24:02.027
And before you go judging Amelia,

24:02.051 --> 24:04.997
let's just take a second to
remember how long you waited

24:05.021 --> 24:07.423
before you told Owen
that you were pregnant.

24:09.058 --> 24:10.236
You're right. You're right.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.704
I'm... I'm sorry.

24:11.728 --> 24:12.796
Yeah.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.208
That's my sister you're talking about.

24:19.235 --> 24:21.614
Yeah, aside from low Vitamin D levels

24:21.638 --> 24:23.749
and some ligament wear
and tear in your C-spine,

24:23.773 --> 24:24.950
you're the picture of health.

24:24.974 --> 24:28.554
When we have bad outcomes,
we tend to blame the conditions,

24:28.578 --> 24:30.389
but sometimes, it's just human error.

24:30.413 --> 24:33.649
And we need to take the hit and move on.

24:40.657 --> 24:42.268
You know, ironically, I'm getting that,

24:42.292 --> 24:43.502
"You are the picture of health,"

24:43.526 --> 24:46.772
is not the news you were hoping to hear.

24:46.796 --> 24:48.007
You don't think there's a chance

24:48.031 --> 24:50.109
that one of your team made an error?

24:50.133 --> 24:54.213
More specifically, um,
that you made an error?

24:54.237 --> 24:59.618
I've read about rare conditions...

24:59.642 --> 25:02.221
a tiny bubble in an artery,

25:02.245 --> 25:04.390
a blip that most doctors would miss.

25:04.414 --> 25:06.892
I mean, if you were to
find something like that,

25:06.916 --> 25:08.627
it would explain everything.

25:11.754 --> 25:13.833
The world is falling apart, Tom,

25:13.857 --> 25:16.669
and people act like, "Well,
somebody's gonna save us."

25:16.693 --> 25:18.737
But I don't see that person.

25:18.761 --> 25:20.806
And I sure as hell can't be that person

25:20.830 --> 25:23.142
from a jail cell.

25:23.166 --> 25:25.911
Just think of all the good you could do

25:25.935 --> 25:29.248
with my resources, my cash.

25:29.272 --> 25:31.750
You could research anything you wanted.

25:31.774 --> 25:33.319
You'd be a legend.

25:33.343 --> 25:36.055
And if anyone ever
caught you, you'd just say,

25:36.079 --> 25:38.991
"Uh, oops, I misread his scan.

25:39.015 --> 25:41.527
Human error."

25:41.751 --> 25:43.829
Take another look at the scans,

25:43.853 --> 25:46.866
just in case there's
something you missed.

26:01.836 --> 26:04.481
Okay, Tom, my patient just died.

26:04.505 --> 26:06.216
So if your billionaire needs a lollipop

26:06.240 --> 26:08.552
or a foot massage,
please go to someone else.

26:08.576 --> 26:09.453
If you had his kind of money,

26:09.477 --> 26:11.444
what would you do with it?

26:12.780 --> 26:14.391
Wh...

26:14.415 --> 26:16.058
I don't know.

26:16.517 --> 26:18.395
I'd triple the size of the clinic.

26:18.419 --> 26:20.530
I'd make half our cases pro bono.

26:20.554 --> 26:22.032
I could develop a research lab

26:22.056 --> 26:23.133
and come up with our own medicine

26:23.157 --> 26:25.202
so we could cut out
big pharma completely.

26:25.226 --> 26:26.203
Public healthcare initiatives.

26:26.227 --> 26:27.704
We could put a stop to food deserts.

26:27.728 --> 26:30.440
We could get healthcare
and nutrition to the homeless.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.875
The point is you'd do good, lots of it,

26:31.899 --> 26:34.511
because this world
never runs out of people

26:34.535 --> 26:36.236
who need help.

26:38.038 --> 26:40.249
How do you decide which rules to break?

26:41.375 --> 26:42.519
How do I decide?

26:42.543 --> 26:45.188
We're surgeons. We live by
rules, precedents, protocols.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.457
I mean, annoying as they are,
they reproduce success,

26:47.481 --> 26:51.561
so, Meredith Grey,
award-winning rule breaker,

26:51.585 --> 26:54.464
how do you decide which rules to break?

26:54.688 --> 26:56.566
I-I just go with my gut.

26:56.590 --> 26:58.201
And I hope that whatever I'm doing

26:58.225 --> 27:02.205
improves this mess of
a world just a little bit.

27:09.503 --> 27:12.349
We believe he's out of immediate danger,

27:12.373 --> 27:15.367
but there's no question he's
gonna have a long recovery.

27:16.143 --> 27:18.722
Does he have family nearby?

27:18.746 --> 27:21.057
Yeah, um, I called.

27:21.081 --> 27:22.692
They're on the way.

27:22.716 --> 27:24.728
He'll also need additional surgeries

27:24.752 --> 27:26.763
to treat the burns and close the wounds

27:26.787 --> 27:28.464
on his arms and leg.

27:29.290 --> 27:31.067
Right.

27:31.091 --> 27:32.801
So...

27:33.861 --> 27:35.695
England...

27:38.666 --> 27:41.811
Um whoever takes care of Brad

27:41.835 --> 27:44.614
needs to be prepared to spend
a lot of time in hospitals

27:44.638 --> 27:46.231
for a while.

27:46.774 --> 27:48.551
I can't... I can't do that. I can't stay.

27:48.575 --> 27:49.753
You don't have to make
that decision right now.

27:49.777 --> 27:51.488
No, but I already decided.

27:51.512 --> 27:53.056
And... And he decided to come with me,

27:53.080 --> 27:55.725
but I was always gonna go,
with or without him.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.080
What does it mean if he
would leave his dream for me,

28:00.104 --> 28:03.923
but I... I won't stay for him?

28:14.468 --> 28:16.346
Wow.

28:16.470 --> 28:19.805
That went from forever
to over in less than a day.

28:20.708 --> 28:22.919
You called it, Jo.

28:22.943 --> 28:26.612
All love sucks eventually.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.442
No.

28:31.285 --> 28:33.830
It doesn't suck.

28:33.854 --> 28:37.968
I've spent all week trying to hate Alex,

28:37.992 --> 28:39.826
and nothing works.

28:40.694 --> 28:42.405
Because every time I get into my car,

28:42.429 --> 28:44.307
I see this little trash bag

28:44.331 --> 28:45.542
that he put in my side pocket

28:45.566 --> 28:49.279
so that I had somewhere to put
my gum wrappers and tissues.

28:49.303 --> 28:52.716
And I felt... I felt so loved

28:52.740 --> 28:55.217
that he did that.

28:55.909 --> 28:59.789
And now he put me in the trash

28:59.813 --> 29:02.248
with the gum wrappers and the tissues.

29:03.751 --> 29:06.352
I'm so mad.

29:08.689 --> 29:10.440
I'm so hurt.

29:11.698 --> 29:14.010
But I also know that he is the reason

29:14.035 --> 29:15.679
that I will get up again.

29:15.829 --> 29:17.507
I will climb out of the trash,

29:17.531 --> 29:19.565
and I will rise.

29:21.668 --> 29:23.279
I'll rise so high

29:23.303 --> 29:25.782
that I'll make him a fool
for ever having left me,

29:25.806 --> 29:27.584
and I'll do it

29:27.608 --> 29:29.668
because of how well he loved me.

29:30.744 --> 29:33.714
I am changed because of him.

29:35.149 --> 29:37.761
He helped me feel worthy of love,

29:37.785 --> 29:41.847
and even though it's over,

29:43.090 --> 29:46.736
that is mine to keep.

29:50.898 --> 29:53.743
Link, don't blow it with Amelia.

29:53.767 --> 29:55.745
I didn't do anything.

29:55.769 --> 29:57.881
She pushed me away. She ended it.

29:57.905 --> 30:00.450
She didn't push you away.
She gave you a choice.

30:01.875 --> 30:03.620
I never had that.

30:18.959 --> 30:22.405
Why did Andrew DeLuca
tell me you'd handed over

30:22.429 --> 30:24.574
your entire service?

30:27.000 --> 30:30.380
Well, lately, um,
the smallest thing sets me off.

30:30.404 --> 30:31.515
And when that happens...

30:31.539 --> 30:34.851
...I-I see red.

30:38.745 --> 30:40.623
I'm sorry.

30:40.647 --> 30:42.125
I know you were just trying to be kind,

30:42.149 --> 30:44.594
and I was wrong to treat you that way.

30:44.618 --> 30:47.631
That doesn't answer my question.

30:47.955 --> 30:51.568
This isn't something I arrived at easily.

30:53.660 --> 30:55.872
I've decided to step away from surgery.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.108
Indefinitely.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.943
I don't care how you arrived at it.

30:59.967 --> 31:02.011
It's the wrong destination. No!

31:02.035 --> 31:04.514
M-My mind is made up, Bailey.

31:04.538 --> 31:05.715
I want to focus on

31:05.739 --> 31:08.751
my PATH Pen and other innovations.

31:08.775 --> 31:10.820
You can do that while you operate.

31:10.844 --> 31:12.055
You know, a little while ago,

31:12.079 --> 31:14.090
you asked how you could help me.

31:14.114 --> 31:16.226
Well, this is how.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.328
Support me on my next adventure.

31:20.654 --> 31:23.800
This room reminds me of another time.

31:23.824 --> 31:25.668
Another me.

31:26.792 --> 31:28.838
It clutters my mind.

31:29.963 --> 31:32.599
- I want to look ahead.
- Richard...

31:33.934 --> 31:36.195
...this place needs you.

31:41.408 --> 31:43.653
And that's how I want to step away.

31:45.245 --> 31:46.712
At the top of my game.

31:49.216 --> 31:50.694
We've both seen people

31:50.718 --> 31:53.796
cling to their scalpels
longer than they should have.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.351
Mr. Ford.

32:07.535 --> 32:09.302
Can I have a minute?

32:20.001 --> 32:22.803
I took another look at your scans.

32:24.351 --> 32:26.428
You have an aneurysm

32:26.974 --> 32:28.753
in your anterior cerebral artery.

32:28.777 --> 32:30.522
I, uh... I missed it, uh, initially

32:30.546 --> 32:32.257
because it's... it's minor.

32:32.281 --> 32:34.144
It's barely detectable.

32:34.983 --> 32:39.720
There's no doubt that it could
influence your judgment.

32:42.991 --> 32:46.738
It's the sort of thing that,
uh, could resolve on its own,

32:46.762 --> 32:51.009
but you may need surgery down the road.

32:51.233 --> 32:55.013
Um, when... when will we know?

32:55.037 --> 32:56.286
Hmm.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.339
Well, when we see the size of the check.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.701
Thanks for waiting.

33:16.725 --> 33:18.903
It was a hell of a day.

33:18.927 --> 33:20.605
- Yeah.
- I had it all pictured.

33:20.629 --> 33:23.241
I was gonna buy you coffee,

33:23.265 --> 33:24.876
and then I was gonna tell
you about the houseboat,

33:24.900 --> 33:27.378
and you were gonna
be really happy for me,

33:27.402 --> 33:29.814
and it was gonna be so nice.

33:29.838 --> 33:31.335
This doesn't feel right, Vic.

33:31.359 --> 33:34.052
And I'm saying that to you
because I have been through

33:34.076 --> 33:37.021
a, um... when... when
something's not right...

33:37.045 --> 33:38.429
- Mm-hmm...
- and you hold on too long.

33:38.453 --> 33:40.959
You know, it's like two
people carrying one stone,

33:40.983 --> 33:41.695
- never...
- Okay, stop talking

33:41.720 --> 33:43.960
like a fortune cookie
and just say it, Jackson.

33:46.755 --> 33:48.800
You don't want to see me anymore.

33:48.824 --> 33:51.369
I am past the time in my life

33:51.393 --> 33:54.072
where I can just go with things...

33:54.096 --> 33:55.773
move in and out on a whim,

33:55.797 --> 33:58.109
move in with a friend who
you tried to set up with my ex,

33:58.133 --> 34:01.252
who has a kid now,
but, hey, it's all good.

34:01.277 --> 34:02.639
Nah, it's not all good.
We're not teenagers.

34:02.663 --> 34:04.656
Okay, but sleeping together
with no commitment...

34:04.680 --> 34:05.957
that's good? Or friends with benefits?

34:05.981 --> 34:07.125
What... that's... that's

34:07.149 --> 34:08.860
state of the freakin' art, Jackson.

34:08.884 --> 34:09.960
What an adult!

34:09.985 --> 34:11.596
Vic.

34:13.989 --> 34:15.766
- We moved really fast.
- Mm-hmm.

34:15.791 --> 34:17.969
I'm just saying we could
take a little time

34:17.993 --> 34:19.271
to get to know each other better,

34:19.295 --> 34:21.639
be... be friends for a little while.

34:21.664 --> 34:22.908
I have friends.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.844
Bye, Jackson.

34:40.783 --> 34:42.994
You too, huh?

34:44.186 --> 34:46.297
God.

34:48.023 --> 34:50.502
You know, on days like this,

34:50.525 --> 34:53.138
Alex would be the one
who would make me laugh.

34:53.161 --> 34:58.443
Dark, gallows humor,
but he made me laugh.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.946
My first day of residency,

35:00.970 --> 35:03.648
when the chief gave us that speech...

35:03.672 --> 35:06.885
you know, "The seven
years you spend here"...

35:06.909 --> 35:10.355
I stood in that room dreaming of being

35:10.379 --> 35:13.291
the last one left of my class,

35:13.315 --> 35:17.129
of being the kind of surgeon
that I have become,

35:17.153 --> 35:19.131
of winning.

35:19.155 --> 35:24.202
Then one by one, they dropped off

35:24.226 --> 35:28.373
till Torres and I were
the only ones left.

35:28.497 --> 35:30.509
Then she left.

35:30.533 --> 35:34.179
At some point, it stops
feeling like victory

35:34.203 --> 35:38.450
and just feels lonely.

35:38.574 --> 35:40.418
I just don't know if I know

35:40.442 --> 35:42.721
how to do this without him.

35:42.745 --> 35:44.689
Or if I want to.

35:44.713 --> 35:47.058
I'm not talking about Alex.

35:47.082 --> 35:50.529
Richard Webber is
stepping down from surgery.

35:50.553 --> 35:53.398
What? Why?

35:53.422 --> 35:55.734
I don't... I don't want to talk about it.

36:03.532 --> 36:05.633
Hey.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.149
You're right.

36:11.173 --> 36:14.019
You deserve a way better apology
than I managed this morning,

36:14.043 --> 36:16.555
which wasn't even...

36:16.579 --> 36:17.723
I'm sorry.

36:17.747 --> 36:20.358
I'm... I'm sorry that I used you.

36:20.382 --> 36:22.060
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

36:22.084 --> 36:23.228
I mean, everything was fine.

36:23.252 --> 36:24.296
I was happy.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.498
Owen and I finally found
our way back to each other

36:26.522 --> 36:28.466
after years of bad timing.

36:28.490 --> 36:29.868
We finally worked.

36:29.892 --> 36:31.603
You know, I-I really
don't think I'm in the mood

36:31.627 --> 36:34.606
to hear how you and Hunt are working.

36:34.630 --> 36:36.386
And then I felt... I...

36:37.266 --> 36:41.313
I feel that he might
choose another woman again,

36:41.337 --> 36:43.715
and I have been through...

36:43.739 --> 36:46.251
with my whole body,

36:46.275 --> 36:50.525
I'm remembering unimaginable loss

36:51.113 --> 36:53.658
and unbearable pain, and you...

36:54.550 --> 36:55.760
You make me laugh.

36:55.784 --> 36:57.729
You make me feel good.

36:57.753 --> 36:59.297
You make me feel like

36:59.321 --> 37:02.634
my life isn't completely
spinning out of control.

37:02.658 --> 37:06.938
And... And I-I hate that that hurts you

37:06.962 --> 37:08.406
because you're such a good guy.

37:08.430 --> 37:10.842
Stop. St... Stop saying that.

37:10.866 --> 37:12.911
I'm really not a good guy, Teddy.

37:12.935 --> 37:15.169
I don't think that's true.

37:19.475 --> 37:21.442
It is true.

37:45.401 --> 37:48.314
Hey, you look like you
could use one of these, huh?

37:48.338 --> 37:49.606
Cheers.

37:52.508 --> 37:54.585
So, Alex. Crazy, right?

37:55.244 --> 37:56.288
Sorry about that.

37:56.312 --> 37:58.757
But on the plus side,
we are both free now.

37:58.781 --> 38:01.259
So we could, uh, make the
best out of a bad situation,

38:01.283 --> 38:02.427
take away each other's pain.

38:02.451 --> 38:03.929
I mean, come on, you're beautiful.

38:03.953 --> 38:05.230
You're brilliant. And where is he?

38:05.254 --> 38:06.431
Nowhere. He doesn't respect you.

38:06.455 --> 38:08.033
Do you think Meredith
respects me? Please.

38:08.057 --> 38:09.737
I think he's a complete
idiot if you ask...

38:11.527 --> 38:13.772
You're not okay. You're not yourself.

38:13.796 --> 38:16.541
Listen to people when they tell you that.

38:16.565 --> 38:18.843
Get help before it's too late.

38:23.806 --> 38:25.383
<i>You would think weightlessness</i>

38:25.407 --> 38:28.420
<i>is a good thing, but it's not.</i>

38:28.444 --> 38:30.155
<i>Because people weren't meant to float.</i>

38:30.179 --> 38:31.990
Hey.

38:32.114 --> 38:33.158
Hey.

38:33.182 --> 38:35.527
The kids are down,
and I thought you'd be starving,

38:35.551 --> 38:37.529
so I roasted a chicken, and, yes,

38:37.553 --> 38:40.999
I put a whole stick of
butter into the potatoes.

38:41.023 --> 38:42.500
My favorite.

38:42.524 --> 38:44.469
I know.

38:44.493 --> 38:46.338
Owen, this is, um...

38:46.362 --> 38:48.329
Wait, wait. Me first.

38:50.032 --> 38:52.510
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

38:52.534 --> 38:54.074
All you did was tell me the truth.

38:54.098 --> 38:56.014
I was shocked, and I froze.

38:56.038 --> 38:58.416
But for our future, Teddy,

38:58.440 --> 39:03.088
I need you to know you are
not a replacement for anyone.

39:03.112 --> 39:05.457
And if you need to tell me anything,

39:05.481 --> 39:07.459
my answer will be, "I love you."

39:08.751 --> 39:12.083
I love you, and we're
gonna figure it out.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.234
And that's my answer now.

39:16.258 --> 39:17.902
That's my answer tomorrow.

39:19.795 --> 39:21.606
That's my answer always.

39:23.565 --> 39:25.443
And I'm sorry.

39:25.467 --> 39:27.979
<i>Without gravity, we lose blood volume,</i>

39:28.003 --> 39:30.481
<i>bone density, muscle.</i>

39:31.807 --> 39:33.718
<i>Without it, we're untethered.</i>

39:54.430 --> 39:57.487
- Oh, hey.
- What are you doing?

39:58.646 --> 40:00.779
I wanted to write you a song,

40:00.803 --> 40:03.448
but I can't write songs,

40:03.472 --> 40:06.584
uh, as fast as I needed to come here

40:06.608 --> 40:09.721
and, um, tell you...

40:09.745 --> 40:13.391
I don't want to live without you.

40:15.651 --> 40:17.629
You seemed pretty clear
about how you felt

40:17.653 --> 40:19.631
if the baby isn't yours.

40:19.655 --> 40:21.166
I was hurting. I was in pain.

40:21.190 --> 40:24.202
But that doesn't mean I don't love you,

40:24.226 --> 40:26.224
Amelia, because I do.

40:26.248 --> 40:27.572
Doesn't mean I don't want you.

40:27.596 --> 40:30.275
Because I do... I want you.

40:30.299 --> 40:32.010
You're the only person

40:32.034 --> 40:33.711
that makes me feel all the things

40:33.735 --> 40:38.483
that I thought I was too smart
or too damaged to feel.

40:38.507 --> 40:41.186
You make me want to write
love songs in the rain!

40:42.111 --> 40:43.655
You make me want to be a parent.

40:43.679 --> 40:45.523
And I don't... I don't give
a crap whose baby it is.

40:45.547 --> 40:49.727
I don't want to feel
this sad and this lonely,

40:49.751 --> 40:51.463
not if I don't have to.

40:51.487 --> 40:53.431
I fell in love with you, Amelia,

40:53.455 --> 40:54.999
and I fell in love with this baby,

40:55.023 --> 40:58.102
and that is what matters to me.

40:58.126 --> 41:00.505
<i>So when you feel yourself
being pulled toward something,</i>

41:00.529 --> 41:02.674
<i>it's not necessarily a bad thing.</i>

41:02.698 --> 41:04.342
So, you want to do this?

41:05.901 --> 41:08.246
Even if he isn't yours?

41:08.270 --> 41:09.514
I do.

41:18.180 --> 41:20.725
I really needed to hear that.

41:21.049 --> 41:22.861
Because I got the results.

41:25.621 --> 41:29.600
- And he is yours.
<i>- It may keep you centered.</i>

41:32.194 --> 41:34.220
But you still got to write me that song.

41:34.245 --> 41:35.773
<i>It may keep you safe.</i>
