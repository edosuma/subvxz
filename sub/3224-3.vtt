00:03.560 --> 00:05.324
I'm trying to fix heaven.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.169
Metatron is trying
to fix heaven.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.242
Metatron isn't trying
to fix anything.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.320
He's trying to break it.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.441
Angels.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.050
They're falling.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.048
Metatron, he took my grace.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.360
That means
you're human.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.169
Cass, listen to me.
There are angels out there.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.571
They're looking for you
and they're pissed.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.606
Until their last breath,

00:24.680 --> 00:26.967
they will seek revenge
on the angel that did this,

00:27.080 --> 00:30.129
- who destroyed heaven.
- Stop.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.328
That was beautiful, Clarence.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.526
We're dealing
with a Reaper.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.364
I could find you anywhere!

00:35.440 --> 00:37.124
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.406
This one goes out to any angel.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.363
This is Dean Winchester.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.124
And I need your help.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.650
- Start with a name.
- Ezekial.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.125
There is a chance
I can fix your brother...

00:45.200 --> 00:47.043
- From the inside.
- What, possession?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.485
It's the best
of a bad situation.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.487
How would it work?

00:49.520 --> 00:51.522
I heal Sam while healing myself.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.331
Sam can eject me at any time.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.488
If Sam does eject me,
he will die.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.722
Then we keep it
a secret for now.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.090
Monsignor Casidy will join us
for dinner on Saturday.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.447
And Mass, of course.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.687
He can be a pain,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.406
so, let's have everybody
on their toes.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.203
Gentlemen,

01:19.280 --> 01:22.443
we're looking for a man
we believe you may know.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.403
His name is Castiel.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.601
Work bus leaves
in ten minutes, gentlemen.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.210
Hey, Clarence.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.285
How much longer are
you gonna be with us?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.886
I'll be moving on tonight
after work.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.450
It's time.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.321
Can I ask you something?

01:58.360 --> 01:59.691
Yeah, sure.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.848
Do you ever tire of urinating?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.089
I'll never get used to it.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.370
Sam!

03:15.440 --> 03:16.441
You here?

03:17.960 --> 03:19.644
Hey. Morning.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.450
You've been outside already?

03:22.520 --> 03:24.204
Yeah.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.645
Woke up, went for a run.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.444
Beautiful sunrise.
Anyways.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.211
Cleaned up,
went and got breakfast.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.964
Grabbed you real bacon and eggs,

03:32.040 --> 03:33.963
extra grease,
not even gonna argue.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.530
Mm, perfect.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.368
Wait...

03:41.440 --> 03:42.566
you went running?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.244
What?

03:44.320 --> 03:45.400
Why do you look so worried?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.489
Let's see, there's Cass,
who I told to haul ass here.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.403
That was days ago,
he's still out there.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.845
Um, there's you.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.327
What, me?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.890
I feel great.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.610
I'm sure you do.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.405
But Sam, you went
through the trials.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.891
Okay, they put
a big strain on you.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.724
I just think it's better
if you took it easy, you know?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.404
And didn't act like you were...

04:05.480 --> 04:06.641
Possessed by an angel.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.766
He does feel better.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.447
A work in progress, of course,
but I am slowly healing him.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.522
That's great.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.726
Um, but Zeke...

04:17.800 --> 04:19.529
I have news.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.005
I've picked up chatter
among the angels.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.691
Not all are wandering around
in confusion.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.484
Yeah, some of them
are after Cass.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.966
There is a faction
that is rapidly organizing.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.850
And finding human vessels
to contain them.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.041
Led by Naomi?

04:35.080 --> 04:37.651
I have not heard that name, no.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.284
But it is this
faction's leadership

04:39.360 --> 04:40.805
who want Castiel found.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.491
You see, Dean, I can be useful.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.768
Well, so can my brother.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.842
So why don't you go
check your email

04:51.880 --> 04:53.644
and if I need your help,
I'll let you know.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.080
- Dean.
- I said I'll let you know.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.930
I mean, you know,
Cass is human now.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.686
It's gonna take him
a lot longer to travel.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.960
I'm gonna get whiplash.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.565
What?

05:09.240 --> 05:11.811
Nothing. Um...

05:11.880 --> 05:13.086
All right,
so, I was thinking that,

05:13.120 --> 05:14.770
if the angels are organizing,

05:14.880 --> 05:18.089
then that makes them a lot more
dangerous than we thought.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.565
Why do you think
they're organizing?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.930
It makes sense.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.684
My point is that
the more of them

05:27.760 --> 05:29.569
that are after Cass,
the worse it is.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.880
So...

05:30.920 --> 05:32.410
we gotta find him.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.370
Folks,
like I've been telling you,

05:35.400 --> 05:37.926
we 're in the
most sacred of times.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.924
A legion of angels
reaches out for us.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.931
Can you feel
their divine presence?

05:44.960 --> 05:47.884
And if you do,
it's nothin' to fear!

05:47.920 --> 05:48.921
Heck, no!

05:48.960 --> 05:50.530
If angels come a-knocking,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.125
you just let them on in

05:52.200 --> 05:57.001
and fill yourself up
with their grace!

05:57.080 --> 05:59.970
This is Reverend Buddy Boyle
and the Going for Glory Hour,

06:00.040 --> 06:03.123
wishing you a most blessed day.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.128
Amen.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.084
And we're clear.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.805
Beautiful, Buddy,
one of your best.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.649
Oh, well, that is
high praise, sir,

06:12.720 --> 06:15.451
seeing as how you're an emissary
of the man upstairs himself.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.607
Thank you, Bart.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.441
It's Bartholomew.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.641
And I have to say,

06:21.680 --> 06:24.001
God has personally
assured me that

06:24.080 --> 06:27.482
he is highly pleased
with your work.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.522
He prepareth a special reward

06:29.600 --> 06:32.683
for helping him populate
a true heaven on Earth.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.570
Well, between you and me,
it's practically reward enough,

06:35.640 --> 06:37.642
being one of the few humans,
of all time,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.445
to get orders
from an actual angel.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.041
But if he prepareth,
I am honored.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.122
Terrific.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.162
Sir?
I'm ready.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.687
Oh?

06:51.720 --> 06:53.484
Let me be a vessel
for the divine.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.606
I give myself over to you.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.966
Oh.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.083
Hallelujah.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.527
Yes.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.643
Well, if you're certain.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.804
Oh, God...

07:49.880 --> 07:51.723
Bart!

07:51.760 --> 07:54.604
What the hell!

07:54.680 --> 07:55.681
Buddy...

07:57.560 --> 07:59.881
...the simple truth is,
not all who are willing

07:59.960 --> 08:02.122
are designed
to contain heaven's grace.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.048
We have to expect a casualty
now and then.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.845
It's a small price to pay
when you think about it.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.767
Like the lamb of the sacrifice.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.645
Sure.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.960
All right, so this is
where Cass called from,

08:19.040 --> 08:21.042
on Tuesday, Longmont, Colorado.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.526
Each circle is how far
he might have gotten,

08:23.600 --> 08:25.045
in one, two and three days out.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.526
Okay.
Here we go.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.046
Uh, same day
he called from Longmont.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.082
Weird murder, same town.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.082
Cops said it was like

08:32.159 --> 08:34.640
the girl was blasted
from the inside out.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.721
Angel kill.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.610
Well, they might have
just missed Cass.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.010
Unless they got him.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.201
You got an Emory Park, Iowa?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.248
Emory Park, Emory Park,
I just saw that.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.247
Yeah...

08:50.280 --> 08:51.805
Uh, a couple of days
outside of Longmont.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.811
Okay, because two priests
were murdered there, Thursday.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.689
Eyes blown out,
evidence of torture.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.171
They were impaled on posts.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.208
- Torture?
- Yeah.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.965
Angels were looking for info.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.600
I mean, if they get to him
before we do...

09:05.640 --> 09:06.926
Yeah.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.962
Thank you.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.729
I was so hungry.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.290
Very kind of you to share.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.367
It's okay.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.963
You know,
I'm finding that often,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.281
people with the least to give
are often the most generous.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.291
Anyway...

09:24.800 --> 09:26.768
...got to plan better.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.280
I ran out of food
very quickly today.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.842
You're new at this, aren't you?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.571
Yes.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.324
Food,

09:37.360 --> 09:39.169
sleep or passing gas.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.329
It's all very strange.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.601
And it's occurred to me

09:44.680 --> 09:46.091
that one day, I'm gonna die.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.921
Well...

09:55.120 --> 09:57.930
I'd better try falling asleep.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.367
It's quite a process, isn't it?

10:00.440 --> 10:01.965
Try counting sheep.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.450
Thanks, once again.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.848
What sheep?

11:11.760 --> 11:12.886
You're human?

11:34.240 --> 11:35.240
Yeah, yeah.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.123
I think I know this guy
you're talking about.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.128
Sounds like Clarence.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.160
Clarence?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.362
The church runs
a shelter in town and

11:42.440 --> 11:43.885
we work here.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.450
We earn our keep.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.962
Clarence spent a couple nights
and then had to move on.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.729
And he left the day
the bodies were found?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.484
Matter of fact.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.241
Oh, man,
those poor guys were a mess.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.726
They must have suffered bad.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.848
But at least now,
they're with the angels.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.207
I sure as hell hope not.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.328
Clarence happen to mention
where he was headed?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.811
No.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.480
He just said he always
had to keep going.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.440
All right, well,
he's definitely been here.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.760
Good news is,
he's getting cagey.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.804
He's using a fake name.
Clarence.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.444
That's what Meg
used to call him.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.005
'Course, he doesn't get

12:23.040 --> 12:24.640
that's the name
of a pretty famous angel.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.844
What?

12:27.880 --> 12:30.087
It's a Wonderful Life.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.924
Dude, seriously?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.446
What'd you come up with?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.124
Another angel kill.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.446
Uh, outside a town
called Lafayette,

12:37.520 --> 12:39.090
about a day's travel
east of here.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.810
- Is that Indiana?
- Yeah.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.842
Body was found
in a homeless camp.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.843
Insides barbecued,
the whole nine.

12:44.920 --> 12:45.842
Homeless guy?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.843
No, a pharmacist

12:47.920 --> 12:49.251
from Dayton.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.043
Huh.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.645
Hot dog!
Come on, get your hot dog!

13:33.280 --> 13:36.807
Reverend Boyle's
influence is astonishing.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.486
I'll never understand
these people.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.164
Our fallen brothers and sisters

13:41.280 --> 13:43.931
are finding vessels faster
than we'd even hoped.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.331
They'd better.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.449
And then they need
to help us find Castiel.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.442
You know,

13:49.520 --> 13:51.921
the one you let slip
through your fingers?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.844
Our Dayton operative
is tracking him.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.285
Good.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.362
Because frankly,

13:58.440 --> 13:59.965
you're hanging by a thread.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.281
What?

14:08.280 --> 14:11.284
Our operative did manage
to find Castiel.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.608
But Castiel was
somehow able to kill him.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.529
What?

14:16.600 --> 14:20.207
He's a madman, sir.
And very dangerous.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.123
No.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.527
I'm very dangerous.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.400
Now you will find this madman
and you will destroy him.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.169
Do you understand?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.480
That may not be possible, sir.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.927
I'm getting
a little tired of you.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.008
Castiel has vanished.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.320
We're unable to track him.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.641
He must have found a way
to ward himself against us.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.528
Please, Lord.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.525
Mike is such a good man.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.688
Please,
send your angels to heal him.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.688
Thank you for hearing me.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.041
Amen.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.561
Mike is your husband?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.365
He's very sick.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.404
Yes.
Humans.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.641
So fragile.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.245
I never...

16:31.280 --> 16:34.363
Never realized how fragile
until recently.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.404
I guess that's why we pray.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.240
You get dealt such
a bad hand sometimes,

16:43.280 --> 16:45.362
you need something
stronger than yourself.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.647
That's a wonderful idea.

16:49.720 --> 16:50.721
But...

16:57.440 --> 16:58.441
What?

16:58.480 --> 17:02.530
What if you were to find out

17:02.600 --> 17:04.762
that no one is listening?

17:04.839 --> 17:08.287
That God had pretty much left?

17:08.319 --> 17:11.449
That heaven had
gone out of business?

17:11.480 --> 17:12.641
What would you do?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.410
But that's not possible.

17:16.440 --> 17:21.048
No, I think
it's completely possible.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.646
You're missing the point.

17:23.680 --> 17:28.481
It's not possible
because I have my faith.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.090
But when I tell you the truth...

17:30.120 --> 17:32.327
Your truth...

17:32.360 --> 17:33.691
not mine.

17:33.760 --> 17:39.051
Your lack of faith
doesn't cancel what I believe.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.764
That's not how it works.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.761
You know,

17:45.800 --> 17:48.451
I think you might feel better
if you tried it my way.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.409
Someone is listening.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.405
The issue is,

18:02.480 --> 18:06.849
he's somehow managed
to ward himself against us.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.764
Our ability to track him
has been jammed.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.968
Which brings us to you.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.724
My kind, we always get
what we're looking for, chief.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.201
Yes, Reapers.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.731
But some of you
have taken your skill-set

18:21.800 --> 18:23.564
to a whole new level.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.562
That's the rumor.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.529
And are willing to freelance.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.846
For a price.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.370
That's the rumor.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.604
Jump-start me.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.691
How do I start looking
for this Castiel?

18:42.720 --> 18:47.169
I got one word for you.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.645
Winchester.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.167
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.851
Vic had a stab wound,
but that's not what killed him.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.370
It's like his insides were...

18:56.400 --> 18:58.243
Vaporized?

18:58.320 --> 18:59.401
It's been going around.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.688
So, this guy was
a pharmacist from Ohio?

19:04.720 --> 19:05.767
Apparently.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.410
Total family man, religious.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.249
One day, just hops
in an SUV, takes off,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.647
dies on a bridge here
from God knows what.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.721
This is his stuff.

19:13.880 --> 19:14.881
Help yourselves.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.285
Thanks.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.604
Anything?

19:27.640 --> 19:28.880
Nothing weird.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.482
Crappy music, a lot of podcasts.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.800
All the same one,

19:33.880 --> 19:37.168
Reverend Buddy Boyle's
Goin' for Glory Hour.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.720
Cop said he was religious.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.810
Join me in a heaping
helping of glory, friends.

19:43.880 --> 19:48.329
When you're in the presence
of the divine, you'll know it!

19:48.400 --> 19:51.404
And if you let yourself,
you'll hear it.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.721
So, remember,
when angels come a-knocking,

19:57.760 --> 19:59.808
let them on in!

20:02.800 --> 20:05.451
Angels can't possess a human
without permission, right?

20:05.480 --> 20:06.720
Yup.

20:06.800 --> 20:07.722
So what,

20:07.800 --> 20:10.201
they're using this guy
to find vessels?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.805
It's a willing audience.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.683
They're all religious types,
like our pharmacist here.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.491
Buddy Boyle's telling them to
let the angels take them over.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.761
Yeah, like body-snatchers.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.689
How big a reach does
this Boyle guy have?

20:33.640 --> 20:34.840
Pretty much the entire planet.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.930
I'm not stealing.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.606
And I'm not a cop.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.841
It's a shame, isn't it?

21:13.880 --> 21:17.362
So much is wasted
when there's so many hungry.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.487
I never knew.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.566
Peanut butter and jelly?

21:25.480 --> 21:27.881
It's pretty good.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.649
No, I can't take your food.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.484
You're not.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.369
I'm giving it to you.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.370
Look,

21:37.440 --> 21:38.930
I've had hard times myself.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.760
Thank you.

21:51.760 --> 21:52.966
Look, for the billionth time,

21:53.080 --> 21:54.844
we're just looking
for some information, okay?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.406
We're not cops.
I mean, do we look like cops?

22:02.080 --> 22:03.889
Well, we're not cops.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.570
We just need to find a friend
who's in it deep.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.331
Look, he might've been here
the night that guy was killed.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.482
Uh, were any of you here, then?

22:10.560 --> 22:11.766
Maybe.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.723
Oh, okay, uh...

22:13.760 --> 22:19.608
He's got dark hair, uh,
blue eyes, little out of it.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.682
He maybe called himself
Clarence?

22:21.760 --> 22:23.091
Clarence, yeah.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.085
You two talk?

22:26.120 --> 22:27.645
Not much.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.087
And, uh...

22:31.440 --> 22:32.680
Think he was on the run.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.003
Did you see him with the Vic?
Uh, victim?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.650
Nah.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.491
Okay?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.961
He went off to sleep
in another part of the resort.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.002
Where?

22:48.080 --> 22:49.445
He's not there now.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.689
Yeah, where'd he go?

22:54.120 --> 22:57.806
I saw him running from under
the bridge to the highway.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.881
You gonna pay us
for all this teeth-pulling?

23:00.960 --> 23:01.882
Where was he headed?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.803
He flagged a truck
heading north.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.006
Detroit, probably.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.411
Why Detroit?

23:06.480 --> 23:08.801
Truck was marked
Motor City Meats.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.886
Wow, it's beautiful.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.002
If you say so.

23:47.960 --> 23:53.569
So you know, I don't usually
bring home strange men.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.801
Am I strange?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.081
Nah, I mean,

23:58.160 --> 23:59.207
men I don't know.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.685
But you look like you've
been to hell and back.

24:03.720 --> 24:07.566
Yeah.
Few times.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.529
April, by the way.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.641
April Kelly.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.690
Castiel.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.768
One name?

24:15.840 --> 24:16.762
Like God.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.286
Or Cher.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.722
Uh, not to raise any red flags,

24:24.760 --> 24:27.047
but do you know
your shirt's soaked in blood?

24:31.920 --> 24:33.001
Look at these chemicals.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.087
You even read the label?

24:34.200 --> 24:35.247
No, I read "pie."

24:35.320 --> 24:36.890
The rest is just
blah, blah, blah.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.490
Listen, when we hit Detroit,

24:38.560 --> 24:40.130
we start
with the homeless shelters.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.249
- Right.
- Then go to the encampments...

24:46.120 --> 24:48.122
Yeah, and I can check
for vagrancy arrests.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.806
Yeah, and you know,

24:50.880 --> 24:51.881
odd deaths.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.522
Who are you?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.965
Why are you trailing us?

25:18.040 --> 25:20.725
You call this rag a bandage?

25:22.280 --> 25:24.601
You're lucky
this wasn't infected.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.202
What happened to the guy
who attacked you?

25:29.360 --> 25:30.885
Oh, I stabbed him.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.964
He exploded.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.885
Funny.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.566
You don't look like
the knife-fight type.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.281
Or the homeless type, actually.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.971
Yes, well,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.810
guess I trusted
the wrong person.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.811
Bad investment advice?

25:56.840 --> 25:59.650
No, vanity.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.920
I thought I was more important,

26:00.960 --> 26:02.883
more effective than I am.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.682
That I could fix everything.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.649
And now, all I can do
is keep running.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.280
Well, all patched up,

26:13.320 --> 26:17.006
but God,
your delts are in knots.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.724
You got to relax.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.649
It's all new to me.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.761
Hunger.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.047
Cold.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.168
This feeling of being all alone.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.000
You're not alone tonight.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.361
So, Maurice...

27:12.240 --> 27:14.720
You bounty hunters are
like Delta Force Reapers.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.211
Why would they sic you on Cass?

27:17.880 --> 27:20.247
He warded himself.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.884
Naomi hire you?

27:26.240 --> 27:29.767
You really are out of the loop.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.841
Naomi's dead.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.171
Resting in pieces.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.004
So then
who's running things now?

27:37.720 --> 27:40.087
Answer!

27:40.120 --> 27:42.805
Her protégé Bartholomew.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.086
He's an up-and-comer.

27:44.120 --> 27:48.762
So he figured
we'd lead you to Cass.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.127
This Bartholomew,
he organizing the angels?

27:56.160 --> 27:58.083
That's all I know.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.089
You can kill me.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.804
It won't matter.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.680
If I don't find Castiel,
there are others that will.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.410
Do what you want.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.129
Sure.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.771
Say something.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.805
There aren't words.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.006
So...

28:36.080 --> 28:37.286
That was okay?

28:37.360 --> 28:39.408
Very much so.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.370
Um...

28:43.800 --> 28:49.250
What I did, that was,
um, correct?

28:49.320 --> 28:50.287
Very much so.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.004
Good.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.086
Good.

28:57.800 --> 29:01.441
Castiel, I can't help thinking,

29:01.480 --> 29:04.165
you know, all that stuff
you said, earlier,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.971
blame and guilt.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.202
It seems like you've
taken on a heavy load

29:11.280 --> 29:12.850
for such a sweet guy.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.207
Believe me, I've done a lot of

29:18.280 --> 29:20.362
foolish and unwise things.

29:23.520 --> 29:27.411
I'm no angel.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.171
Well, whoever you trusted...

29:32.360 --> 29:34.442
Can't they help undo this?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.082
We're not in contact.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.409
So what happens next for you?

29:44.920 --> 29:46.365
More of this, I hope.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.370
I washed your stuff.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.482
Find everything okay?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.449
As a matter of fact,
something is missing.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.560
Oh?

30:23.600 --> 30:26.524
It was with my jacket.
It's hard to describe.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.085
Oh, you mean this?

30:44.960 --> 30:47.088
What's up?

30:47.160 --> 30:48.924
Chasing our tails, all night.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.291
No, Cass.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.401
What's up?
I'm fried.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.560
I think it's time for Plan B.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.245
I'm not following.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.566
I'm letting you know.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.886
Okay?
Um...

31:09.960 --> 31:12.247
Letting me know what?

31:12.280 --> 31:15.170
I'm letting you know.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.327
What is it, Dean?

31:26.360 --> 31:27.521
I need your help.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.170
That is flattering.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.167
We've been through this.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.520
I cannot be making
public appearances.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.522
I know, I understand that.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.887
I'm not asking you to walk
the red carpet, Zeke, okay?

31:34.960 --> 31:37.645
I need your help finding Cass.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.091
It cannot be done.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.321
He is warded.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.930
I know that.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.331
But maybe you can use
your intergalactic,

31:43.360 --> 31:46.648
hyper-space, X-ray eyeballs
to find someone else.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.650
There might be
a Reaper for rent on his ass.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.688
Could you find them?

31:53.760 --> 31:55.091
I can try.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.526
It's probably pointless,

32:04.560 --> 32:06.961
washing the blood
out of your shirt, really.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.207
It's the kind of thing
the real April would have done.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.209
I'll miss being her.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.287
Very sweet.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.931
Didn't mind me
entering her one bit.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.650
Why didn't you just
attack me right away?

32:18.680 --> 32:22.207
My briefing said you were
dangerous and powerful.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.566
And you did arrive armed.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.051
So...

32:26.480 --> 32:31.042
I needed information.
So I had to gain your trust.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.048
And that required intercourse?

32:35.400 --> 32:39.371
Well, I am allowed some leeway
for executive decisions.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.721
And I can't say
I didn't find you attractive.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.249
Who hired you?

32:49.360 --> 32:53.251
I assumed with Naomi gone
things were in chaos.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.727
New sheriff in town, Cass.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.331
He hired a bunch of us.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.085
I got lucky.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.129
But enough questions from you.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.009
I have several of my own.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.730
Let's talk about
your buddy Metatron.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.520
All right, let's try this, again

33:18.560 --> 33:20.403
and one of these times,
we'll get it right.

33:20.480 --> 33:25.042
I knew nothing about
Metatron's spell.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.686
I didn't know he was gonna
cast the angels out of heaven.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.364
I was cast out, too.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.362
Oh, dear.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.522
Nothing but re-runs
on this channel.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.283
These blades are marvelous,
aren't they?

33:37.360 --> 33:40.762
They really do
a number on humans, too.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.280
I told you last night,

33:43.360 --> 33:45.681
and I meant it, I was naive.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.491
I had no idea
what he was planning.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.608
You're lying.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.808
It's known you helped
Metatron enter heaven,

33:52.840 --> 33:54.569
collaborated with him.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.490
Because we were going
to restore heaven.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.131
Bring the factions together.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.404
He lied to me.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.681
You were with him
when he unleashed the spell.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.330
You know how the angels
were cast down.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.647
I didn't know
he was assembling a spell.

34:10.719 --> 34:13.087
I only knew

34:13.120 --> 34:14.804
that I was the final ingredient.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.284
You?

34:18.320 --> 34:21.130
MY grace.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.083
It's why I'm human.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.639
He took my grace for the spell.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.643
Or you gave it.

34:27.719 --> 34:32.168
It may be unwise to kill me.

34:32.239 --> 34:35.641
If my grace were the key
to empowering the spell,

34:35.679 --> 34:37.569
I may be key to countering it.

34:37.639 --> 34:40.210
Are you negotiating
with me, Castiel?

34:42.840 --> 34:44.284
Cass!

34:58.880 --> 35:01.360
This girl is popular
with all the boys.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.569
Cass.
Cass.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.326
Cass?

35:24.920 --> 35:26.649
Cass!

35:26.720 --> 35:29.326
No.
No, no.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.606
Sam, he's gone.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.604
Dean?

36:27.640 --> 36:28.880
Hey...

36:28.920 --> 36:30.604
Hey.
Yeah.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.403
And Sam.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.962
Cass.
You okay?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.490
Never do that again!

36:52.280 --> 36:54.487
All right.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.801
But I'm confused.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.683
I know she stabbed me,
but I'm...

36:59.920 --> 37:02.446
I don't appear to be dead.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.330
Well, you got dinged.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.885
And, uh...

37:10.960 --> 37:14.851
...you,
I made a deal with her.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.450
I said she wouldn't get kebabed

37:16.480 --> 37:17.925
if she brought you back.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.251
She brought you back.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.962
You lied.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.684
I did.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.881
I do that.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.440
You know,

37:41.480 --> 37:43.289
you never answered my question.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.806
How did you know
where to find Cass?

37:45.840 --> 37:48.002
I told you, I went through
Maurice's pockets,

37:48.080 --> 37:50.401
I found an address,
I took a shot.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.324
I never saw you go through
Maurice's pockets.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.010
What are you talking about?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.565
Look, I don't see half
the nerdy stuff that you do.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.961
Doesn't mean that
you don't do nerdy stuff.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.884
I am really enjoying this place.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.167
Plentiful food.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.282
Good water pressure.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.887
Things I never even
considered before.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.930
There really is a lot to
being human, isn't there?

38:13.000 --> 38:17.722
It ain't all just burritos
and strippers, my friend.

38:18.000 --> 38:18.887
Yeah.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.843
I understand what you're saying.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.882
You do?

38:22.960 --> 38:27.045
Yes, there's more
to humanity than survival.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.770
You...

38:28.840 --> 38:31.320
You look for purpose.

38:31.400 --> 38:36.406
And you must not be defeated
by anger or despair.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.086
Or hedonism, for that matter.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.724
Where does hedonism
come into it?

38:40.760 --> 38:44.685
Well, my time with April
was very educational.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.563
Yeah.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.763
I mean, I would think that
getting killed is something.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.924
And having sex.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.721
You had sex with April?

38:55.760 --> 38:57.640
Yeah, that would be
where the hedonism comes in.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.763
So,

39:04.800 --> 39:06.450
did you have protection?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.570
I had my angel blade.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.128
Oh, he had the angel blade.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.604
- Um...
- In any event, I...

39:16.640 --> 39:19.883
I do now
see how difficult life can be

39:19.960 --> 39:22.964
and how well
you two have led it.

39:23.040 --> 39:27.489
And I think
you'll be great teachers.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.610
Thanks, Cass.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.643
Are there any more burritos?

39:33.720 --> 39:34.767
Uh, yeah.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.801
It's...

39:41.480 --> 39:42.970
Oh, our little Cass.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.530
He gave it up to a Reaper.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.601
That is...

39:45.640 --> 39:48.530
Castiel cannot stay here.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.649
He will bring the angels
down on all of us.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.006
No, no, he's got
the Enochian tattoo.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.080
He's warded.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.488
He was warded
when April found him.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.530
And she killed him.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.170
Yes, and you brought him back.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.811
And I thank you for that,
but this is Cass.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.644
Okay, who vouched for you,

40:06.680 --> 40:08.011
when I didn't know
you from jack.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.891
The bunker is safe.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.851
Bartholomew is massing a force.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.770
We cannot stand an incursion.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.604
Castiel is in danger.

40:20.680 --> 40:24.924
And if he is here,
I am in danger.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.525
Wait, you're in danger?

40:26.560 --> 40:27.766
From who, the angels?

40:30.160 --> 40:35.530
If he stays, I am afraid I will
have no choice but to leave.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.210
Well, no, you can't do that.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.207
Sam's not well enough,
all right?

40:38.280 --> 40:39.486
If you leave his body...

40:39.520 --> 40:40.726
I know.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.125
I am sorry.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.480
This ethnic food,

40:50.520 --> 40:51.965
I can't get enough.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.923
Cass, uh, can we talk?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.286
Of course.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.610
Dean, you know I always
appreciate our talks

41:03.680 --> 41:04.920
and our time together.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.246
Listen, buddy, um...

41:13.280 --> 41:14.691
you can't stay.
