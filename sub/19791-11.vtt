00:00.937 --> 00:03.672
Hey, watch out! Pregnant
girl comin' through.

00:03.707 --> 00:05.207
Man, I'm hungry.

00:05.242 --> 00:06.642
(all chattering)

00:06.676 --> 00:09.411
Sad I had to specify "girl."

00:09.446 --> 00:11.313
Are you okay? Are you comfortable?

00:11.348 --> 00:12.515
All right, nobody touch her!

00:12.549 --> 00:15.235
The doctor said she could
explode at any moment!

00:16.232 --> 00:18.110
Give birth, Danny.
The doctor said that

00:18.136 --> 00:19.801
I could "give birth"
at any moment.

00:19.836 --> 00:21.736
But I'm fine, all right?
It was just false labor.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.264
Apparently it happens all the time.

00:23.364 --> 00:25.432
Well, having been pregnant
now for almost four hours,

00:25.466 --> 00:26.966
I think I'd know for sure if a person

00:27.001 --> 00:28.435
was really about to crawl head first

00:28.469 --> 00:29.944
out of my body.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.973
Oh, she'll know. Trust me.

00:33.007 --> 00:34.407
<i>That chick from Alien
will have nothin'</i>

00:34.433 --> 00:35.831
<i>on her, just... (makes
explosion noise)</i>

00:35.906 --> 00:37.006
Mom!

00:37.040 --> 00:38.341
Right, right, right.

00:38.375 --> 00:39.709
But good news... the second one

00:39.743 --> 00:41.372
just pops right out.

00:41.812 --> 00:45.415
One minute you're dancin' at
a Bon Jovi concert, yeah...

00:45.449 --> 00:47.116
and the next, someone's
all like, "Oh my gosh,

00:47.151 --> 00:49.452
who dropped a baby on the floor? Ohh..."

00:50.221 --> 00:53.323
I can't believe they
made me buy you a ticket.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.826
Now are you sure that there is
absolutely nothing we can get you?

00:56.861 --> 00:59.329
I am feeling very maternal.

00:59.363 --> 01:02.662
Well, I know it's late,
but I am a little hungry.

01:02.762 --> 01:05.030
- Maybe pizza?
- Ooh, perfect.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.166
But you know what would
be even better? Pancakes!

01:07.200 --> 01:07.700
Ooh!

01:07.726 --> 01:09.701
Oh, no, I'm... I'm not really
in the mood for pancakes.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.904
Yes, yes! And there's that place
on Bleecker that's open all night!

01:11.938 --> 01:16.475
- (everyone talking at once)
- I love that place!

01:18.478 --> 01:19.679
They'll be back.

01:19.713 --> 01:23.115
- Oh my, okay...

- Okay!

01:47.441 --> 01:48.641
Oh, my... Honey, look.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.775
I know the doctor said

01:49.810 --> 01:51.143
I shouldn't do anything too strenuous,

01:51.178 --> 01:52.979
but do you think I could not do anything

01:53.013 --> 01:54.146
in my own apartment?

01:54.181 --> 01:55.314
Well, what if we're all alone

01:55.349 --> 01:56.482
and I have to go to the bathroom

01:56.516 --> 01:57.583
or get some water?

01:57.618 --> 01:58.718
What then, Riley, what then?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.920
Ah, yes, what then?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.255
You know, well, now that you mention it,

02:02.289 --> 02:03.723
um, I am a little thirsty.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.157
Right. I'm on it.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.226
Uh, hey, Ben. I need
to get Riley some water.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.928
You mind watchin' her
while I go to the kitchen?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.096
You got it.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.599
We're back!

02:13.634 --> 02:16.435
So cute. How was dance class today?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.970
Eh, you know, it was all right.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.805
Mainly sat in the back
with the only other cool mom

02:19.840 --> 02:22.041
and made fun of the
awkward and ugly kids, so...

02:23.543 --> 02:24.777
I was actually talking to my daughter.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.878
- Oh.
- Yeah.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.713
So, how was dance class today?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.382
Who's my mommy?

02:30.417 --> 02:34.086
Wow. Okay. Your mommy, that's new.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.289
Well, we talked about this, remember?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.758
Her name's Angela and
she lives in Los Angeles.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.192
Why?

02:40.227 --> 02:41.928
We just got lucky, I guess.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.329
Ben!

02:43.363 --> 02:46.132
I'm sorry, the books
all say to be honest!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.700
What's all this about, anyway?

02:47.734 --> 02:49.468
Well, I'm guessing
it has something to do

02:49.503 --> 02:50.736
with the mother/daughter talent show

02:50.771 --> 02:52.905
Emma's class is having.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.740
Mother/daughter talent show?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.509
Okay, this is wrong on so many levels.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.445
How dare they make Emma feel
bad for only having a father.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.646
That's my job.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.915
Hey, hey, hey, all this
anger and negativity

03:02.950 --> 03:04.917
is stressing Riley out.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.285
Here. I'll hold it while you take a sip.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.088
Ahh! You wanna know what's
really stressing me out?

03:10.590 --> 03:12.558
How cold it is in here.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.594
Uh, Danny, do you... do you think
you could go get my blue blanket,

03:15.629 --> 03:17.707
and if you don't see
it, just keep looking.

03:17.807 --> 03:19.141
It's definitely real.

03:20.310 --> 03:22.030
Got it!

03:21.678 --> 03:22.678
Oh, hey, Ben!

03:22.713 --> 03:24.046
You've gotta promise
if anything happens,

03:24.081 --> 03:25.081
you'll be there for Riley.

03:25.115 --> 03:26.716
You got it. Treat her like the weird kid

03:26.750 --> 03:29.418
who eats paste and has
mittens pinned to his jacket.

03:31.622 --> 03:33.657
Oh wait, that was you!

03:35.926 --> 03:38.094
Dude, I'm serious.

03:38.128 --> 03:39.362
Brother to brother.

03:39.396 --> 03:40.763
If I'm not there when the baby comes,

03:40.798 --> 03:43.299
you gotta promise to be there to
take care of my wife and my son.

03:43.334 --> 03:45.668
Yeah. Danny, of course, I promise.

03:48.639 --> 03:51.463
You hear that, baby? We're on our own.

03:53.411 --> 03:54.778
Oh, hey, man, anything happening yet?

03:54.812 --> 03:56.012
No, but I don't
have time right now...

03:56.047 --> 03:57.216
Oh, my god, I'm so happy for you.

03:57.316 --> 03:59.384
Tucker told me about the false
labor and I totally get how stressful

03:59.418 --> 04:00.752
that can be. I went
through it for weeks,

04:00.786 --> 04:02.487
but at least it increased
the value of my push gift.

04:02.521 --> 04:04.122
I got this sapphire ring.

04:05.457 --> 04:07.025
I'm sorry, your what gift?

04:07.059 --> 04:09.227
Push gift. It's what
a husband gets his wife

04:09.261 --> 04:11.396
for pushing a bowling
ball through a straw?

04:13.566 --> 04:14.900
You got her one, right?

04:14.934 --> 04:16.168
No...

04:16.202 --> 04:19.303
Oh. Hello, worst husband ever. (laughs)

04:19.338 --> 04:20.572
Way to start off on the wrong foot.

04:20.606 --> 04:22.140
Babe, babe, babe... remember we talked

04:22.175 --> 04:24.476
about not saying everything
that comes into your mind?

04:24.510 --> 04:26.211
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. This is one of those moments.

04:26.245 --> 04:28.053
- Oh.
- It's gonna be fine, man.

04:28.153 --> 04:30.122
No. No, it's not gonna be fine.

04:30.222 --> 04:31.989
The baby's gonna come, and
I'm gonna be standing there

04:32.023 --> 04:34.859
with nothing in my hand
besides a used umbilical cord!

04:34.893 --> 04:36.026
That's it. I'm gonna go down

04:36.061 --> 04:37.194
to the jewelry store on the corner.

04:37.229 --> 04:38.896
Dude, what is the matter with you?

04:38.930 --> 04:41.465
Man, you don't wanna pay retail. Dude.

04:41.500 --> 04:46.112
Man, look, I'll hook you up,
okay? Trust me, man, I got a guy.

04:46.605 --> 04:50.108
(giggles) Suddenly this necklace
you got me doesn't seem so special.

04:52.978 --> 04:55.013
Yes, I knew she'd start
asking questions someday,

04:55.047 --> 04:56.798
but that's not what this is about.

04:56.849 --> 04:59.317
It's about me not being enough for her.

04:59.352 --> 05:00.819
Seriously, what does she need a mom for?

05:00.853 --> 05:03.455
- There's nothing I can't handle.
- Well, honey, let's circle back

05:03.489 --> 05:05.623
to that when it's time
to discuss her period,

05:05.658 --> 05:07.473
or her first bra,
or birth control...

05:07.573 --> 05:09.274
Mom, none of those
things are ever happening!

05:11.444 --> 05:15.113
Okay, maybe it would be good
for both of us if I had someone.

05:15.147 --> 05:16.848
A partner.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.283
A real mom for Emma.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.986
Maybe I should've never
stopped looking for Elle.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.487
Yeah, why did you stop?

05:22.521 --> 05:24.622
Uh, maybe 'cause every single
time I ever mentioned her,

05:24.657 --> 05:26.257
you ridiculed and mocked me?

05:26.292 --> 05:28.994
(scoffs) Well, if you're
gonna let that stop you,

05:29.028 --> 05:31.110
I'm surprised you can get
out of bed in the morning.

05:31.564 --> 05:34.208
It's hard! It's really hard!

05:34.533 --> 05:35.773
You know what I'm gonna do?

05:35.873 --> 05:37.440
I am gonna find Elle.

05:37.475 --> 05:40.310
Okay, you do that. I looked
for almost nine months.

05:40.344 --> 05:41.945
But I'm goin' down to that dance studio.

05:41.979 --> 05:43.213
There's no way they're stoppin' me

05:43.247 --> 05:44.968
from dancing with my daughter.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.285
Unless I have to wear tights.

05:48.319 --> 05:49.720
I want people to see
that I'm a good dad,

05:49.754 --> 05:51.388
but that's all I want them to see.

05:55.226 --> 05:56.853
So where's your guy?

05:56.953 --> 05:58.533
He'll be here, all right?

05:58.633 --> 06:00.469
But remember... this is a negotiation.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.138
A dance, all right?
There'll be a

06:02.164 --> 06:03.938
little back and forth,
but in the end,

06:03.972 --> 06:07.442
you will have a beautiful,
almost-diamond bracelet for Riley.

06:08.944 --> 06:11.145
Hey. Who's this?

06:11.180 --> 06:13.589
My associate. Do you
have the merchandise?

06:13.689 --> 06:16.091
Yeah. This is gonna cost you 500.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.459
Oh, that sounds really reasonable.

06:17.493 --> 06:20.261
But there is no way that
that is happening. (laughs)

06:20.296 --> 06:23.298
To be honest with you, man,
we only brought 200 with us.

06:23.332 --> 06:25.834
Oh, no! I grabbed that envelope
I keep in my sock drawer

06:25.868 --> 06:28.418
on the way out. It's
got like 2,000 in it.

06:28.571 --> 06:30.806
Plus I might have a
little more in my wallet.

06:32.108 --> 06:34.442
So, can I assume
that... okay, yeah.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.445
And I'll take the cell phones, too.

06:35.545 --> 06:37.880
Yeah. W... We don't
have cell phones.

06:37.914 --> 06:41.483
Oh... no, I got mine.
Here, I'll call yours.

06:41.518 --> 06:43.118
(phone ringing)

06:44.788 --> 06:47.089
And how dare you make my
little girl feel different?

06:47.124 --> 06:48.557
- Ooh, hey, Benji...
- But even more important,

06:48.592 --> 06:49.692
make me answer difficult questions

06:49.726 --> 06:51.757
I'm not emotionally
equipped to deal with.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.442
Ben...

06:52.468 --> 06:54.746
Not now, Mom, this
baby daddy's on a roll.

06:54.846 --> 06:56.649
This should be about the children.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.217
Okay? Some of these kids have two moms,

06:59.251 --> 07:00.885
some of 'em have two dads.

07:00.919 --> 07:02.920
And there's that one girl
who's got two of each,

07:02.955 --> 07:04.956
which just seems like overkill.

07:05.658 --> 07:09.027
Uh-huh. And if you look
at the bottom of the flyer,

07:09.061 --> 07:11.796
you will see that this
is an all-inclusive event.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.333
And the girls are free to
perform with whomever they choose.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.936
Yeah, that's what I
was trying to tell you.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.772
I did not see that.

07:20.806 --> 07:22.238
But it's good to
know that you'll be

07:22.264 --> 07:23.733
incorporating some
of my suggestions.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.846
Hey... your name isn't Elle, is it?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.548
Mom, I think I would
know if she was Elle.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.651
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- Ooh wait, can we go out the back?

07:31.751 --> 07:33.258
The other cool mom
and I are in a

07:33.284 --> 07:34.780
fight, and I don't
wanna run into her.

07:35.021 --> 07:38.190
Turns out the awkward kid I
was makin' fun of was hers.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.860
Is he here? Oh, did I miss him?

07:41.895 --> 07:42.629
Is who here?

07:42.729 --> 07:43.763
I don't know his name. I saw him

07:43.797 --> 07:45.030
almost nine months ago,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.066
and I'd about given up hope,
but then I was across the street

07:47.100 --> 07:48.252
and I thought I saw
him through the

07:48.278 --> 07:49.435
window, but then
there was this bus,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.303
and this horse, and...
It's a long story.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.339
But if you could just give me
the name and number of the guy

07:53.373 --> 07:55.207
who was just in here,
that would be great.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.795
No problem. Because
clients love it whenever

07:57.821 --> 08:00.089
we give out their
personal information.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.616
Right. But at least
I know he's a client.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.551
Of course, with my luck,
he's probably married.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.754
Oh, he is definitely not married.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.522
Yes! I knew it!

08:09.556 --> 08:12.592
I knew he was single.
Please, you have to help me.

08:13.394 --> 08:15.925
There's honestly nothing I can do.

08:25.340 --> 08:26.807
Are you having a stroke?

08:28.710 --> 08:32.946
No! I just thought you
might be interested in this.

08:34.115 --> 08:36.570
Oh... yeah, no, I don't have a kid.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.504
But he does! He's coming to the show!

08:38.538 --> 08:40.445
Yes. I'll just come to
the show and then I

08:40.471 --> 08:42.441
can finally meet him,
it's gonna be perfect.

08:42.475 --> 08:46.111
Yeah, I'd lower those
expectations a bunch.

08:50.016 --> 08:51.417
Well, I did it! I had it out

08:51.451 --> 08:53.686
with the dance studio, and
they definitely see it my way.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.988
- Well, I...
- Just let me have this one thing!

08:57.091 --> 08:58.992
Hey, Emma, so it's not
gonna be a problem anymore.

08:59.026 --> 09:00.593
You get to dance with Daddy.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.462
I want my mommy.

09:03.897 --> 09:05.898
Okay. No problem.

09:05.933 --> 09:08.568
That doesn't break Daddy's heart
into a million pieces at all.

09:09.937 --> 09:12.338
Welcome to the dark side of parenting.

09:12.373 --> 09:16.075
Ohh! Speaking of parents,
I think I'm about to be one.

09:16.677 --> 09:17.844
The baby is coming!

09:17.879 --> 09:19.846
- Oh, god! Okay, all right. You guys...
- Oh! Go, go.

09:19.881 --> 09:21.147
(Ben chattering)

09:27.414 --> 09:29.549
Hey... I'm so sorry.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.217
My smartphone got lost.

09:31.252 --> 09:33.427
Turns out it's not that smart.

09:33.988 --> 09:36.456
It's fine, just be glad
it was another false alarm.

09:36.491 --> 09:38.592
Oh, by the way, I
guess we need a car seat

09:38.626 --> 09:40.317
to take the baby home from the hospital.

09:40.328 --> 09:41.528
Yeah, I read that in a pamphlet

09:41.563 --> 09:44.198
when I was just flashing my
vagina to 12 med students.

09:44.232 --> 09:47.868
Oh, we're on it. But, do you think
I could borrow your credit card?

09:47.902 --> 09:50.137
I think I might've
misplaced my wallet as well.

09:54.476 --> 09:57.778
Hey, did you hear that? Now I
know exactly what to get Riley

09:57.812 --> 09:58.480
for her push gift.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.781
Dude, I'm tellin' you
right now, a car seat

10:00.816 --> 10:02.216
is a horrible idea.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.752
No, I'm gonna get her
the car to put it in.

10:04.786 --> 10:06.921
Really? Seems like a pretty big gift

10:06.955 --> 10:09.599
for just sittin' around with
her feet up for nine months.

10:09.991 --> 10:11.792
If I don't get her a car,
what am I supposed to get her?

10:11.827 --> 10:14.557
And this is where your
friend Tucker steps in, man.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.392
While you were off endlessly
measuring your wife's cervix,

10:17.427 --> 10:21.260
I was coming up with the
greatest push gift idea ever.

10:21.297 --> 10:24.029
What do women like
even more than jewelry?

10:24.100 --> 10:25.134
Being right?

10:25.168 --> 10:27.270
(elevator dings)

10:27.370 --> 10:29.872
No... they like puppies.

10:29.906 --> 10:31.140
I've got a guy.

10:31.174 --> 10:35.945
Really? Oh, my god, this
is the best idea ever.

10:35.979 --> 10:39.949
A new puppy and a baby
all in the same day.

10:39.983 --> 10:43.252
She's gonna feel like the
luckiest girl in the world.

10:45.522 --> 10:48.558
Don't be upset. You know it's
just a phase Emma's going through.

10:48.592 --> 10:51.994
Yeah, whatever, it's so not
a big deal. Die, die, die!

10:52.863 --> 10:56.399
Are you sure you're okay?
The TV isn't even on.

10:58.402 --> 11:01.671
Look... you know she totally loves you.

11:01.706 --> 11:03.840
Honestly, I'm just
glad my mom is doin' it.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.610
Last place I wanna be right now
is stuck at some stupid rehearsal

11:06.644 --> 11:08.912
with a bunch of screaming kids in tutus.

11:08.946 --> 11:10.380
No-no.

11:12.150 --> 11:13.383
What is it, Emma?

11:13.417 --> 11:15.519
I wanna dance with you.

11:15.553 --> 11:18.054
Me? You really wanna dance with me?

11:18.089 --> 11:19.491
Well, heck, yeah, I'll dance with you.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.792
See? I knew it was just a phase.

11:21.826 --> 11:23.627
And if we hurry, we can be
there in time for rehearsal.

11:23.661 --> 11:26.045
Oh my gosh, this is
gonna be so much fun.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.538
And it seems I am being abandoned
by a whole new generation.

11:32.638 --> 11:34.960
And yet, I feel like somehow
you had a hand in this.

11:34.986 --> 11:35.540
(Scoffs)

11:35.574 --> 11:38.825
I don't care what you say, but
there is a good person in there.

11:39.011 --> 11:41.846
A very small person, but she's in there.

11:43.148 --> 11:44.582
- Beep, boop...
- Okay, stop it.

11:46.251 --> 11:47.852
I have my moments.

11:47.886 --> 11:50.858
And I'm going to continue my
good deed tour and go find Emily.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.859
- Don't you mean Elle?
- Dammit! God...

11:52.893 --> 11:55.428
That's a whole morning's
worth of work down the crapper.

11:55.463 --> 11:56.763
God!

12:00.201 --> 12:02.869
(babbling in high-pitched voices)

12:02.903 --> 12:05.839
(gasps) Oh... my god,

12:05.873 --> 12:09.342
that is the cutest puppy ever.

12:09.376 --> 12:10.710
Oh, yes she is.

12:10.744 --> 12:12.046
- Aww...
- (Danny and Tucker laugh)

12:12.146 --> 12:13.246
It's Riley's push gift.

12:13.272 --> 12:16.450
It was my idea, but you know
I'm lettin' him take the credit.

12:16.484 --> 12:17.684
(laughs)

12:17.718 --> 12:21.389
(laughing)

12:21.489 --> 12:23.524
Oh, my god, are you serious?

12:23.558 --> 12:27.079
You want Riley to take
care of a baby and a puppy?

12:27.105 --> 12:28.529
(Elevator dings)

12:28.563 --> 12:29.765
Oh god! (laughs)

12:29.865 --> 12:31.799
Even I don't hate her that much!

12:31.833 --> 12:34.268
(laughs) You are a dead man!

12:34.302 --> 12:36.672
God! A puppy!

12:36.772 --> 12:40.708
Oh, man, Danny, I worry about
you, you're slow, man! (laughs)

12:45.914 --> 12:48.716
- So, a car?
- Yeah, a car sounds good.

12:50.386 --> 12:51.386
You ready?

12:54.123 --> 12:58.405
♪ Sweet pea, apple of my eye ♪

12:58.505 --> 13:02.741
♪ Don't know when

13:56.030 --> 13:57.564
I love you, Emma.

14:02.718 --> 14:05.682
Bam! You are never gonna
believe what I did.

14:05.782 --> 14:07.516
Well, you know what? I don't
really care what you did,

14:07.550 --> 14:09.785
because I have been here
alone for almost three hours.

14:09.819 --> 14:11.353
Oh, no, no, no, I did get a break

14:11.387 --> 14:12.654
when I had to help Ben find a costume,

14:12.689 --> 14:13.990
do Emma's hair, and make them lunch.

14:14.090 --> 14:16.125
But I literally have no
idea where my husband is,

14:16.159 --> 14:17.827
this thing is just tap
dancing on my bladder,

14:17.861 --> 14:20.462
and g... I can't get the
lid off this mayonnaise jar!

14:21.698 --> 14:23.566
Who is that?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.868
Well, it's a little anti-climactic now,

14:25.902 --> 14:28.470
but this... is Elle!

14:28.505 --> 14:29.572
Hi!

14:29.606 --> 14:31.273
- This is Ben's Elle?
- Yeah.

14:31.308 --> 14:33.609
- How did you do that?
- Well, I just retraced his steps

14:33.643 --> 14:35.411
back to the dry cleaner
where he first met her.

14:35.445 --> 14:37.815
So... do you remember Ben?

14:37.915 --> 14:42.082
Well, um, no, not really,
but... he sounds amazing!

14:43.717 --> 14:46.019
- So you...
- Yeah, a little bit. (clears throat)

14:46.053 --> 14:46.557
So is he here?

14:46.583 --> 14:48.321
No, he's getting ready
for the talent show.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.690
Okay, let's go. Oh my gosh,
Ben is gonna be so surprised!

14:50.724 --> 14:52.460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you guys
are not going anywhere without me.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.494
Um, just get the chair from Ben's desk

14:54.528 --> 14:55.595
and start pushin'.

14:55.630 --> 14:57.497
Oh, my god, we don't have the time.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.467
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

14:59.567 --> 15:01.468
Shut the door! God!

15:05.740 --> 15:07.541
Hi, hi, I'm here.

15:07.575 --> 15:08.776
I didn't miss it, did I?

15:08.810 --> 15:10.944
No. Wait... aren't you supposed to be

15:10.979 --> 15:12.517
in a giant bubble somewhere?

15:12.617 --> 15:14.684
I put two pillows under a blanket

15:14.719 --> 15:16.121
so it looks like I'm still there.

15:16.221 --> 15:17.721
That's the one useful
thing you taught me.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.493
Bonnie?

15:22.527 --> 15:24.696
Oh. Hey, Liz.

15:24.796 --> 15:26.363
What are you doin' here?

15:26.398 --> 15:28.699
Honestly? Hoping to meet
the man of my dreams.

15:28.733 --> 15:32.770
(laughs) At a
mother/daughter talent show?

15:32.804 --> 15:34.939
God, you're bad at this.

15:34.973 --> 15:37.376
Ohhh! It's coming!

15:37.476 --> 15:38.876
The baby is really coming this time!

15:38.911 --> 15:40.345
Wait, are...
are you sure?

15:40.379 --> 15:41.369
Could you maybe just
cross your legs

15:41.395 --> 15:42.413
for a couple minutes
until we're done?

15:42.448 --> 15:44.882
No, I can't just cross my
legs, because someone is trying

15:44.917 --> 15:46.851
to crawl out of there. Ow, ow, ow, ow,

15:46.885 --> 15:49.053
and it feels like he's trying
to dig a brand new tunnel.

15:49.088 --> 15:50.555
Use the existing tunnel!

15:50.589 --> 15:53.891
Oh! Okay! I need you to text
my phone. Danny has mine.

15:53.926 --> 15:54.827
Right! Danny, okay.

15:54.927 --> 15:56.594
What's wrong? What's going on?

15:56.629 --> 15:58.363
- Oh god, ow!
- This is it, the baby's really coming!

15:58.397 --> 16:00.198
Okay, can't you just cross your legs?

16:00.232 --> 16:01.933
I mean, we're all kind of
in the middle of something.

16:01.968 --> 16:03.101
(grunting, gasping)

16:03.135 --> 16:04.903
All right, you know what, I
will take her to the hospital,

16:04.937 --> 16:06.571
you go on with Emma, and
just meet me there, okay?

16:06.605 --> 16:09.274
I can't, I promised
Danny... Oh, right! Danny!

16:09.308 --> 16:11.242
Okay, and... send.

16:11.277 --> 16:14.412
Okay, Emma? I am so, so
happy that you asked me

16:14.447 --> 16:15.315
to do this with you.

16:15.415 --> 16:17.749
But I really need to help your
Auntie Riley deliver your new cousin.

16:17.784 --> 16:20.219
I am so sorry, but Grandma
will dance with you.

16:20.253 --> 16:21.487
Okay?

16:21.521 --> 16:22.855
Okay, okay. Oh, my god, Ben!

16:22.889 --> 16:25.891
Ben, I almost forgot. I found Elle!

16:25.925 --> 16:27.860
- Really? Where is she?
- Second row.

16:27.894 --> 16:29.127
- Here?
- Yes!

16:29.162 --> 16:30.896
Oh, my god, stop that.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.002
That's really her! Oh,
my god, Mom, I love you!

16:36.036 --> 16:37.436
Ahhhh!

16:37.471 --> 16:39.305
Right. Just give her my information
and I'll see her later, okay?

16:39.339 --> 16:40.474
- Okay, all right.
- Bye, sweetie. Let's go. Let's go.

16:41.074 --> 16:43.042
Okay. All right. Listen, kiddo.

16:43.076 --> 16:45.311
It's showtime. Okay? Lose the ukulele,

16:45.345 --> 16:47.513
and don't get in my way during my solo.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.815
Five, six, seven, eight...

16:49.850 --> 16:50.950
Dun-nah-dun-dun.

16:50.984 --> 16:53.185
Wah-tah! (grunts) What?

16:53.220 --> 16:54.854
Ooh, g... Ooh!

16:58.726 --> 17:01.027
I have to say, these
babies are so popular,

17:01.061 --> 17:03.263
we're actually chargin'
a thousand over sticker.

17:03.297 --> 17:04.931
That sounds fair.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.800
(phone buzzing)

17:07.835 --> 17:11.204
Oh, my god. This is it!
Riley's havin' her baby!

17:11.239 --> 17:12.873
We gotta go!

17:12.906 --> 17:14.473
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- (Engine starts)

17:14.509 --> 17:16.443
Hang on!

17:16.477 --> 17:17.777
- (crashing sound)
- Oh!

17:19.247 --> 17:20.316
(clattering sound)

17:20.342 --> 17:22.317
You know what? Thank
you for the test drive.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.117
I think... I think we're
just gonna keep looking.

17:26.054 --> 17:28.722
Ohhh!

17:28.757 --> 17:30.924
Ahhh!

17:30.959 --> 17:33.327
Riley, you have to calm
down. It's all gonna be fine!

17:33.361 --> 17:36.330
Really? Because it doesn't feel
fine from where I'm sitting.

17:36.364 --> 17:38.532
Ahh! Where's the doctor?

17:38.566 --> 17:41.802
The clinic's a little understaffed,
but they paged someone,

17:41.836 --> 17:44.973
and worst case scenario, I've
actually done this before.

17:45.073 --> 17:46.941
You stay away from me!

17:48.710 --> 17:50.811
I'm Dr. Ryan. So what's the problem?

17:50.846 --> 17:53.748
Oh, you know just a little
bloating... I'm having a baby!

17:53.782 --> 17:56.217
Oh, wow, right.

17:56.251 --> 17:59.520
Yes, you are! And here it comes.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.391
Wait. It's you.

18:03.426 --> 18:04.626
It's really you.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.561
My god, it's you!

18:06.595 --> 18:07.829
I can't believe it!

18:07.863 --> 18:09.664
I was just at a dance
studio looking for you

18:09.699 --> 18:10.765
when I got paged.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.600
I know, I saw you! I'm Ben.

18:12.635 --> 18:14.402
- I'm Elle.
- I'm dying!

18:14.437 --> 18:16.571
- Right!
- Oh, and this isn't mine.

18:16.605 --> 18:18.675
Good to know. Okay, I can do this.

18:18.775 --> 18:21.243
Uh, you can do this?
Haven't you done this before?

18:21.277 --> 18:24.513
Well, not on an actual
person, but it'll be fine.

18:24.547 --> 18:25.948
So, you're a doctor?

18:25.982 --> 18:28.617
Yeah. Well, almost. Fingers crossed.

18:29.652 --> 18:31.153
Hey, maybe we can go
out for a drink sometime?

18:31.187 --> 18:31.874
Ahhh!

18:31.900 --> 18:34.496
Oh, my god, just give
us like two minutes?

18:35.125 --> 18:36.225
I'm here!

18:36.259 --> 18:38.027
The father? Just in time. I need you.

18:38.061 --> 18:39.462
Riley, here, hold my hand.

18:39.496 --> 18:40.696
G... Ohh, god!

18:40.731 --> 18:43.099
- Ow!
- Come on! Big push!

18:43.133 --> 18:45.201
(both screaming)

18:45.235 --> 18:47.069
Okay, give me one more.

18:47.104 --> 18:49.004
(both screaming)

18:50.073 --> 18:51.041
(baby crying)

18:51.141 --> 18:53.076
Is that it? Did I do it?

18:53.110 --> 18:55.878
You did it. And he's perfect!

18:58.082 --> 18:59.816
I can't believe it's really you.

18:59.850 --> 19:01.251
You were amazing.

19:01.285 --> 19:03.186
No, you were amazing.

19:03.220 --> 19:06.089
Hey, can we all agree
that I was amazing?

19:07.291 --> 19:11.194
Hey, little buddy. Are
you ready to meet your mom?

19:23.307 --> 19:24.674
I love him.

19:25.743 --> 19:27.677
So do I.

19:27.712 --> 19:28.845
And I love you.

19:32.617 --> 19:34.317
Hey, since you're already
gonna be watching

19:34.343 --> 19:35.785
one baby tonight,
can you watch Emma,

19:35.820 --> 19:37.520
so I can go out with Elle?

19:43.561 --> 19:46.663
So, Sweet Pea, you and I have to talk.

19:46.697 --> 19:50.033
I'm startin' to realize that maybe
I can't always be your everything,

19:50.067 --> 19:53.103
but I finally found that
girl we saw nine months ago.

19:53.137 --> 19:56.339
Now, I don't know what's gonna happen...

19:56.374 --> 19:59.809
but if I do it right... there's
a chance that you might finally

19:59.844 --> 20:02.078
have a full-time mom.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.446
What do you think?

20:03.481 --> 20:06.016
I only need you, daddy.

20:11.222 --> 20:12.989
I love you, sweetheart.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.325
Well, little girl, it's good to
know that we have each other.

20:22.425 --> 20:24.426
Because no matter what happens,

20:24.460 --> 20:26.728
it's always just gonna be the two of us.

20:26.762 --> 20:28.797
No, Brad, not every construction worker

20:28.831 --> 20:30.265
that is whistling is looking at you.

20:30.652 --> 20:32.153
Hi, sweetie.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.055
(all talking at once)

20:34.089 --> 20:36.457
Oh my gosh...

20:36.491 --> 20:38.559
Well, I take that back.

20:38.593 --> 20:41.295
I don't think it's ever
gonna just be the two of us.

20:41.329 --> 20:42.566
(everybody talking at once)

20:42.592 --> 20:44.699
Riley: Oh, I can finally
have a glass of wine!

20:44.733 --> 20:46.534
(chatter continues)
