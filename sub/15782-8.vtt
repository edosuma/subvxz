Good morning.</i>

to your new homes.</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:18.809
<i>As your bodyguard, I must
prepare you for the worst.</i>

00:18.893 --> 00:20.978
<i>Your father
is most likely dead.</i>

00:21.062 --> 00:23.147
<i>He was crushed to death
by a disco ball,</i>

own sons from here on out.</i>

I plan on shooting myself,</i>

the Venture estate down.</i>

that would be the worst,</i>

Oh, good.
You're up. Here.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.219
Put this on and meet me
out back.

00:53.302 --> 00:55.555

to Boca Raton.

Blackie died 15 years ago.

That's Entmann -- first of
Team Venture to go.

01:08.859 --> 01:10.695
Gosh, I'm awful sorry.

01:10.778 --> 01:13.614
"You are my pal, and you are
my friend.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.492
And your weird body,
to heaven, I send.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.703
When you were massive
and full of size,

01:18.786 --> 01:21.622
you gave me council,
because you were wise.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.083
Saying, 'Action Man,
take it down a notch.

01:24.166 --> 01:27.336
Stop just thinking
with your Action crotch.'

01:27.420 --> 01:29.880
And when you were shrunk down
to a little mole,

01:29.964 --> 01:32.633
you were able to
swim laps in a little bowl.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.803
Now you are dead
'cause of my chair.

01:35.886 --> 01:38.264
I had no idea that
you were there.

01:38.347 --> 01:41.225
When I rocked back in repose,

01:41.309 --> 01:44.353
you died and began
to decompose."

Nope.
You're the youngest here.

a napkin, that's bread.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.248
You scoop up your couscous
With it.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.250
Sorry. I'm used
to bread-shaped bread.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.252
Don't drink that.
Dysentery.

You'll be crapping your brains
out all over my antiques.

You'll learn the customs here
in no time.

02:12.923 --> 02:14.550
I hope I don't have to.

I really think my dad's okay,

You call me Pop-Pop.

Hey, you remember me,
do you, laddie?

02:26.520 --> 02:29.482
So, you might want to show me
a little more respect.

02:29.565 --> 02:31.609
Respect?
You clowns were a joke

02:31.692 --> 02:33.986
even before the Action Man
went to rehab.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.489
Sorry, the old ears don't
hear so good anymore.

02:36.572 --> 02:38.449
What was that?
- You heard me.

02:38.532 --> 02:41.661
Dean, be a good boy and go
pick a song on the jukebox.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.288
This man wants to dance
with your Pop-Pop.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.456
Okay.

02:45.539 --> 02:47.750
He's a little young...
even for you.

Are you sure you want to have
a fight?

a thumb.

02:51.295 --> 02:53.005
Uh... the left one.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.840
The right one's
too powerful for you.

Idiot, you're camping
on our property.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.370
How dumb do you think I am?
- Uh, very?

03:24.453 --> 03:26.330
Yeah, I'd love to keep
playing this game with you,

03:26.414 --> 03:27.873
but we got problems.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.668
The Monarch has Doc.
- How did that happen?

03:30.751 --> 03:32.837
Doc crashed a party
at Don Hell's.

Not smart.

I know it's touchy for you,

03:39.176 --> 03:40.803
and you'll probably baby out
on me,

a good man...

an old couch, I assume.

Calm down! I'm almost done.

putting him in the one

04:02.908 --> 04:05.411
with a hungry rat in a cage
that he wears as a mask?

04:05.494 --> 04:07.037
It'll eat his nose.

MRS. MONARCH:
I told you -- rats, piranhas,

04:08.456 --> 04:10.541
sharks, and badgers are
too much hassle.

04:10.624 --> 04:12.835
No animals.
- Okay!

04:45.075 --> 04:46.410
I really
appreciate this.

against Guild regulations

Yeah, not buying it.
I know you're the softie here.

at the rodeo.

Rodeo's over, baldy.
You're hog-tied.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.048
I'm just waiting
for my husband

04:59.131 --> 05:01.091
to pick out a barbecue sauce
to spread on you.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.094
- Ow!
- Yeah, dislocated. Figured.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.097

I know you clowns aren't gonna do anything.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.891
You never do.

05:08.974 --> 05:11.018
Yeah, he may not be very good
at it, but he loves it,

05:11.101 --> 05:13.437
and I love him, so you
better play along.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.064
How about you
pop my hip back in place,

05:15.147 --> 05:16.941
and I send you a little
tax-free donation?

05:17.024 --> 05:19.777
You are gonna cry in agony if
my husband tickles you.

05:19.860 --> 05:22.822
You will plea for your life if
he gives you a back rub.

05:22.905 --> 05:26.116
You will try to escape
just so he can catch you.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.035
Why... would I do that?

05:28.118 --> 05:29.870
Because if you don't,
I will straight-up

05:29.954 --> 05:32.706
just slit your throat.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.000

No, no. You wouldn't do that.

to epinephrine?

No, I'm not
allergic to any anesthetics.

And I'm not allergic
to hand lotion,

05:44.802 --> 05:47.721

a happy ending.

Hello, Rose.

Yes, I was just leaving anyway.

Okay,

Oh, dear.
What is the matter?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.831
Oh, it's been a heck
of a year, Rose.

06:13.914 --> 06:16.208
I-I lost my wife,
my best friend,

06:16.292 --> 06:19.545
and now my -- my son is
hooked on rock 'n' roll.

06:19.628 --> 06:20.838
Rock 'n' roll?!

06:20.921 --> 06:22.840
Rodney, that's
the devil's music.

06:22.923 --> 06:24.842
Hey, old man.
I was just playing my bass

06:24.925 --> 06:27.177
at a volume
that's unreasonable.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.888
Can you give me some money
to buy records

06:28.971 --> 06:30.306
With clear warning labels?

06:30.389 --> 06:31.307
Oh, Rose.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.517
You got to help me
straighten him out.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.437
You ain't never gonna stop me
from overly sexualized dancing

06:36.520 --> 06:38.314
and dressing like an indigent.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.565
Loud rock music!

06:39.648 --> 06:41.609
The devil has a grip on you.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.861
You've got to fight him, sweetie.

06:43.944 --> 06:45.988
You have to fight him
with show tunes.

06:46.071 --> 06:48.365
Show tunes?
If I play them backwards,

06:48.449 --> 06:51.035
Will they make me want to try
reefer cigarette marijuanas?

06:51.118 --> 06:52.369
Oh, heaven's no.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.997
They will make you want
to solve problems in song.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.582
And with dancing.

06:56.665 --> 06:59.585
Gosh, I think I'd like
to get hooked on show tunes now.

06:59.668 --> 07:01.670
I've been so wrong about everything.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.672
You're the best father
in the world!

07:03.756 --> 07:05.341
Aw, shucks, son.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.343
I couldn't have done it
without Rose, here.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.136
- You sure do make
a great team.

07:09.219 --> 07:11.138
Hey, Pop, maybe she'd like
to have dinner with us?

07:11.221 --> 07:14.058
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm sure Rose is very --

when Salem comes on screen,

07:21.273 --> 07:22.733
then stop it when he's off.

07:22.816 --> 07:24.109
Then you write the time down

07:24.193 --> 07:26.070
and indicate whether it was
that crappy puppet

07:26.153 --> 07:28.072
or an actual cat.

07:28.155 --> 07:30.908
Are all these tapes
"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch"?

07:30.991 --> 07:32.034
Well, obviously, son.

07:32.117 --> 07:34.453
It's the only show that starred
Salem the Cat.

07:34.536 --> 07:36.080
Now, once you finish that,

07:36.163 --> 07:38.457
you get to take dictation
for "I Gentleman,"

Calamity Conference shirt.

That was like 5 feet.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.185
Aww, it says
I'm his best henchman.

07:58.268 --> 07:59.603
It's a t-shirt.
So what?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.772
You got any weapons?
- Under the bed.

08:01.855 --> 08:03.774
The Ventures never gave me
a t-shirt.

08:03.857 --> 08:06.402
Boo-hoo.
I tattooed a "V" on my face,

08:06.485 --> 08:08.404
And I still got to pay
for my own food.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.406
Where's your costume?
- Why do you do it?

08:10.489 --> 08:12.908
What? Bodyguard?
It's all the same.

for what he cares about.

Well, what do you
care about?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.293
Yeah, just point me at a cause,

Yeah, no.
So, uh... should I just...

17:04.396 --> 17:06.191
Yeah, let yourself out.

17:06.273 --> 17:09.069
Uh, break a couple of things.
Make it look good.

17:09.152 --> 17:11.988
God. I liked being tortured
more than this here.

17:12.071 --> 17:15.325
This is... ugh.

17:15.407 --> 17:18.203
I'm just so damn lonely, Rose.

17:18.286 --> 17:19.621
Let's give it a shot.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.540
We're just too different, Rodney.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.708
You're a womanizer
and a junkie.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.417
Oh, no.
That all ended.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.463
I was faithful to Jeannie
'til the day she died.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.216
And junkie?
I-l was a dang super soldier.

17:31.299 --> 17:32.551
Jonas had me on jump juice

17:32.634 --> 17:34.219
for the good of flag
and country.

17:34.302 --> 17:35.887
I kicked that years ago.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.182
Rodney, that's just a bushel
of baloney.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.560
[gasps]
Wait a minute. That voice!

17:41.643 --> 17:44.604
I-I finally figured out
why you're so familiar.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.231
Do you have a son
named Billy?

17:46.314 --> 17:48.191
Uh, big head, eye patch,
metal hand,

17:48.275 --> 17:49.818
probably a midget?

17:49.901 --> 17:52.654
Yes.
Oh, my little water baby.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.656
Oh, I haven't seen him
in years.

17:54.739 --> 17:56.366
He moved in with a man.

17:56.449 --> 17:58.660
I think he was afraid
I'll disapprove of his...

17:58.743 --> 18:00.453
lifestyle choice.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.581
I don't even know
where he is anymore.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.541
Well, I do.
He's my neighbor.

18:04.624 --> 18:07.711
Hey, how about you two
come visit me back home?

18:07.794 --> 18:09.796
You and Uncle Rodney
and my new bass

18:09.879 --> 18:13.800
and your little water baby
can have a nice reunion.

18:13.883 --> 18:16.970
Yes. Well, that sounds
just elegant.

HATRED:
All right, Gary.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.691
Judas. Betray me, will you?

18:29.774 --> 18:32.527
Oh, ho, a reckoning's coming, buddy.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.238
A reckoning is coming!

18:37.782 --> 18:39.826
Sweetie, Dr. Venture escaped!

18:39.909 --> 18:42.287
No, he didn't.
I let him go.

18:42.370 --> 18:45.582
What? Are you okay?
Why did you let him go?

18:45.665 --> 18:47.876
Because I broke him!

18:47.959 --> 18:51.171
I broke his will!
I broke his spirit.

18:51.254 --> 18:53.048
Oh, my lovely,
naive little girl,

18:53.131 --> 18:55.175
how easy it is
to break a bone,

18:55.258 --> 18:58.720
but to break a man's heart --
that takes genius.

18:58.803 --> 19:01.097
Physical torture?
Wounds heal.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.724
But mental torture?

19:02.807 --> 19:05.977
Those wounds only grow
and fester.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.855
I have crushed
Dr. Venture!

19:08.938 --> 19:12.651
[laughs maniacally]

19:12.734 --> 19:16.112
You know I'm the shit!
- I am so turned on.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.864
You have to do me
right now.

19:17.947 --> 19:20.283
Come.
Service your evil genius.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.869
[ Door opens ]
Oh, uh... hey, you guys

19:22.952 --> 19:24.871
I'm, uh... I'm home?

19:24.954 --> 19:26.706
HATRED:
<i>Attention, Gary.</i>

19:26.790 --> 19:29.501
It's your old pal,
Sergeant Hatred.

19:29.584 --> 19:32.629
Come out with your hands up,
or I will --

19:32.712 --> 19:34.631
Oh. Oh, that's a missile.

19:34.714 --> 19:37.467
Oh, boy.
That is on all kinds of fire.

19:37.550 --> 19:40.303
It's heading for the house
and it is on fire.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.763
Gary, I still hate you,

19:41.846 --> 19:43.473
but you gotta get out
of there!

19:43.556 --> 19:45.809
You got to evacuate, man!

19:48.478 --> 19:50.563
Oh, the humanity!

19:50.647 --> 19:52.607
I-I'm just gonna go now
and, uh...

19:52.691 --> 19:54.859
we'll pick this up
another time.

19:54.943 --> 19:58.488
[coughs]
What the fuck was that?

19:58.571 --> 20:00.490
Our cocoon.

20:00.573 --> 20:03.368
[coughs]
That sucked.

20:03.451 --> 20:05.412
Who the fuck is Gary?

20:05.495 --> 20:07.580
[ Up-tempo music plays]

20:33.523 --> 20:36.067
[ car doors close ]

20:36.151 --> 20:38.069
MRS. MONARCH:
Oh, it's so romantic.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.029
We're moving into the house
you were raised in.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.531
It's like a fairy tale.

20:41.614 --> 20:43.700
Uh, it didn't look quite this
bad when I was a kid.

20:43.783 --> 20:45.493
Yeah, it looks like
the kind of place

20:45.577 --> 20:48.371
that has creepy, wet Asian kids
crawling on the ceiling.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.166
He's a lying, two-timing
little so-and-so,

20:51.249 --> 20:52.751
and I broke bread with him!

20:52.834 --> 20:54.377
I even broke heads with him.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.045
You can't
take it personally.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.714
Oh, just watch me!

20:57.797 --> 20:59.591
Just play along.
It's not gonna kill you.

20:59.674 --> 21:01.551
Why would you
tell your mom I'm gay?

21:01.634 --> 21:03.511
I didn't tell her.
I just didn't deny it.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.680
She sent us that China
and the sideboard.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.432
White, you love
that sideboard.

21:07.515 --> 21:09.476
So, this is Peter.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.644
He's as handsome as you said
he was, Billy.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.480
You said I was handsome?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.608
Yeah, it's a little brownstone
on Christopher Street.

21:16.691 --> 21:18.651
You can bring Rose.
What do you say?

21:18.735 --> 21:21.404
If you don't mind the sound
of old people having sex,

21:21.488 --> 21:24.407
you've got yourself
a roommate.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.576
Dean, you look like
someone died.

21:26.659 --> 21:27.994
This is a funeral, Hank.

21:28.077 --> 21:30.288
No, I mean, like,
all the time.

21:30.371 --> 21:32.415
You've been a mess
this whole year, man.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.000
You've got to tell me
what's eating you.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.336
You want to know, Hank?
Okay, fine.

21:36.419 --> 21:38.713
I'm sick of keeping it in,
so I'll just tell you.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.550
[sighs]
We... are... clones, Hank.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.552
Our whole lives --
it's a lie.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.430
We're not really Hank and Dean anymore.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.890
We've died like 13 times,

21:48.973 --> 21:51.434
and now we're copies of ourselves.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.019
We're clones.

21:53.102 --> 21:55.355
Clones.

21:55.438 --> 21:58.650
Dean...
that is awesome.

21:58.733 --> 21:59.901
You're --
you're not upset?

21:59.984 --> 22:01.444
About what?!

22:01.528 --> 22:03.071
That I'm, like,
some kind of super-cool,

22:03.154 --> 22:05.740
probably magic,
Highlander cyborg clone?!

22:05.824 --> 22:07.033
Uh, no.

22:07.116 --> 22:10.537
Hey, just one more reason
it's great to be a Venture.

22:12.580 --> 22:13.998
ACTION MAN:
Goodbye, old friend.

22:14.082 --> 22:17.502
Hope you're happy
in your new resting place.

22:17.585 --> 22:20.338
Okay, who's the youngest?

22:20.421 --> 22:21.798
Don't look at me.

22:21.881 --> 22:24.467
Dean, son!
We need you over here.
