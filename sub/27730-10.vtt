WEBVTT

00:08.486 --> 00:11.011
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:11.054 --> 00:14.449
You are the only one who has
had contact with the Red Angel.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.451
You said you don'’t understand
why it chose you.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.586
SPOCK:
It guided me to a remote planet

00:21.630 --> 00:23.719
and showed me...

00:23.762 --> 00:25.677
the end.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.689
SPOCK:
My perception of reality
was challenged

00:37.733 --> 00:39.865
by visions from
a time-traveling entity.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.259
Who should help me
but you, of course?

00:42.303 --> 00:45.784
After all, the entire
Klingon war was your doing.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.743
CULBER:
That version of me

00:47.786 --> 00:49.701
that called your quarters home,

00:49.745 --> 00:51.225
that version of me is dead.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.096
And I'’m not going back.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.533
Would you please
just move forward

00:55.577 --> 00:57.361
and let me do the same?

00:59.755 --> 01:02.149
CORNWELL:
Whether I can issue orders
or not,

01:02.192 --> 01:05.369
we have to get a team onto
that station and reset control.

01:05.413 --> 01:09.112
Michael, you have to open
the airlock.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.940
No. I'’m not gonna eject you
into space.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.160
I will unlock this door.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.944
I will kill you.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.598
Everything is
because of you.

01:16.641 --> 01:17.990
Because of me?

01:18.034 --> 01:20.080
You have to find
Project Daedalus.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.472
Where is Project Daedalus?

01:37.488 --> 01:40.622
PIKE:
Commander Airiam reminds us
that resilience

01:40.665 --> 01:44.191
is an unshakable virtue.

01:44.234 --> 01:47.107
She was fiercely loyal...

01:47.150 --> 01:48.934
to her crew...

01:51.241 --> 01:52.764
...to Starfleet.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.208
And, in her final moments,

02:01.251 --> 02:05.603
she sacrificed herself
for that loyalty.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.039
That is how she'’ll be
remembered.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.787
TILLY:
Some people choose
to live their lives

02:15.831 --> 02:17.963
as if nothing is a miracle,

02:18.007 --> 02:20.488
but Airiam fought for her life,

02:20.531 --> 02:23.012
and so everything was.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.797
Everything that she saw,
everything that she felt,

02:25.841 --> 02:28.539
all of her memories,
they made a kind of...

02:28.583 --> 02:31.847
constellation for her.

02:31.890 --> 02:36.330
I'’m... I'm grateful to her
for that lesson.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.598
She was my friend.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.513
STAMETS:
She said once,

02:45.556 --> 02:49.734
without a hint of self-pity,

02:49.778 --> 02:53.216
that the paths of trillions
of particles

02:53.260 --> 02:56.393
had been forever changed,
simply because

02:56.437 --> 02:59.396
she and her husband smiled
at each other.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.400
She was happy that together

03:03.444 --> 03:06.969
they made the universe
a little less orderly.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.449
DETMER:
I just felt the weight

03:08.492 --> 03:11.365
of what I had lost...

03:11.408 --> 03:14.281
but she showed me that
my augmentation didn'’t make me

03:14.324 --> 03:16.326
an imitation of myself.

03:16.370 --> 03:20.069
It made both of us new.

03:20.112 --> 03:22.506
And that there could be
a future.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.987
She was right.

03:27.511 --> 03:31.820
BURNHAM:
There are so many reasons
to join Starfleet.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.174
We get to reach for the stars.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.872
We get to reach
for the best in ourselves.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.920
But, most important,

03:44.963 --> 03:48.010
we get to reach for each other.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.753
We get to do what we love

03:51.796 --> 03:55.887
alongside colleagues
who become friends...

03:55.931 --> 03:59.021
who become family.

03:59.064 --> 04:04.287
And who better to stand with,
shoulder to shoulder,

04:04.331 --> 04:06.811
facing those pivotal moments?

04:08.117 --> 04:10.162
Who more painful to let go?

04:14.645 --> 04:17.344
I am so sorry, Airiam.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.785
On Kaminar,
we sing songs of remembrance

04:23.828 --> 04:26.875
for those who have been taken
from us too soon.

04:26.918 --> 04:30.835
This is a song of remembrance
for Airiam.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.373
You spoke beautifully.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.156
Thank you.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.596
I'’m so sorry.

05:35.639 --> 05:38.076
I'’m sorry you were confined
to quarters for so long.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.732
I told Captain Pike
you weren'’t responsible.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.648
It'’s okay.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.782
If I were in his shoes,
I'’d have done the same.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.741
I just wish it had
played out differently.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.309
Yeah.

06:00.098 --> 06:01.317
Michael.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.976
I can feel what you'’re trying
to do, Ash.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.194
I can.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.764
But Section 31 created Control,

06:13.808 --> 06:15.636
and some future version
of it came here.

06:15.679 --> 06:18.334
And now Airiam is gone.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.728
You don'’t think I knew
what was happening, do you?

06:20.771 --> 06:22.947
Of course not.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.301
But your duty is still to them.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.569
So...

06:43.141 --> 06:45.753
PIKE:
Let'’s start with
everything we know.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.364
The A.I. is from the future.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.366
It infected Airiam
and forced her

06:50.410 --> 06:52.890
to copy some of the
Sphere data into Control

06:52.934 --> 06:54.718
so Control could evolve.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.154
We stopped her before
that could happen.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.461
How did the Section 31 program

06:58.505 --> 07:01.333
designed to eliminate threats
become the threat?

07:01.377 --> 07:02.770
Time travel.

07:02.813 --> 07:03.988
The one variable we cannot

07:04.032 --> 07:05.729
possibly predict is the future.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.818
And clearly,
that future A.I. is built

07:07.862 --> 07:10.604
on advanced technology of which
we have no understanding.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.345
How do we stop it?SARU: To the best
of our knowledge,

07:13.389 --> 07:16.740
the future A.I. only infected
Airiam and Control.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.787
Airiam'’s neural system was
erased before her funeral.

07:19.830 --> 07:24.705
As for Control,
it was used only by Section 31.

07:24.748 --> 07:28.099
We destroyed the station
where Control was located,

07:28.143 --> 07:30.275
and, per your
suggestion, Admiral,

07:30.319 --> 07:33.888
we advised all Section 31 ships
to run diagnostic tests.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.324
All came out clean.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.021
PIKE:
Let'’s not celebrate
just yet.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.328
The A.I. that infected Control

07:39.371 --> 07:40.851
could have sent itself
off-station.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.027
We have to assume that it'’s
lying dormant for now,

07:43.071 --> 07:44.725
but it could reemerge
at any time.

07:44.768 --> 07:48.511
And when it does, we have to
be able to destroy it somehow.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.342
Hi. Oh, um... Sorry, uh,
Captain... Admiral. Everyone.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.083
I-I should have knocked.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.693
Although it-it is kind of
pointless, these doors

07:56.737 --> 07:58.478
pretty much open right on
their own most of the time.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.349
Ensign,
did you need something?

08:00.392 --> 08:02.046
Uh, uh, well, actually,
I found... I have something.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.613
I mean, I found something.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.788
Um...

08:04.832 --> 08:06.964
So I was, uh...

08:07.008 --> 08:09.880
I was reviewing some scans
of Airiam'’s system,

08:09.924 --> 08:12.013
and I-I found this weird
code, and at first,

08:12.056 --> 08:14.450
I figured, uh, it'’s just
some junk from an old update,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.408
but then I discovered
it'’s actually a file

08:16.452 --> 08:18.802
that was implanted there
by a digital parasite.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.849
The file is called
Project Daedalus.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.981
Those are the last words
Airiam said to me.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.550
The file also contains

08:27.594 --> 08:30.248
a bio-neural signature
of the Red Angel.

08:32.729 --> 08:33.948
Michael, it'’s you.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.057
PIKE:
While Dr. Culber hasn'’t been
officially reinstated,

10:23.100 --> 10:24.449
I'’ve asked him
to oversee analysis

10:24.493 --> 10:27.017
of the data Tilly uncovered.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.454
SPOCK:
The results are conclusive?

10:29.498 --> 10:32.283
Well, every test that I'’ve run
on Commander Burnham

10:32.327 --> 10:34.634
is a 100% match
to the bio-neural signature

10:34.677 --> 10:36.723
found in Airiam'’s Daedalus file.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.289
We have to consider the source.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.030
Airiam was compromised.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.684
The A.I. could have
had her plant information

10:41.728 --> 10:43.338
to throw us off course.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.166
I see no logical
or strategic reason

10:45.209 --> 10:47.385
for Airiam to have provided
a false positive.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.040
And even if she had, it would
have read too perfect.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.086
Humans have a few
neural wild cards

10:52.129 --> 10:53.914
that anything artificially
generated couldn'’t replicate.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.829
I would have caught it.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.527
We'’re saying that Michael,
our-our Michael Burnham,

10:58.570 --> 11:00.268
is going to wake up one day,

11:00.311 --> 11:03.663
access time-travel technology
that doesn'’t exist yet,

11:03.706 --> 11:05.708
and take it upon herself
to save the galaxy.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.231
That supposition fits

11:07.275 --> 11:09.233
her emotional profile
rather precisely,

11:09.277 --> 11:11.758
particularly her drive
to take responsibility

11:11.801 --> 11:13.760
for situations
often beyond her control.

11:13.803 --> 11:17.285
Thank you for sharing that
with the group, Spock.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.722
SPOCK:
We must also assume
the cataclysmic events I foresaw

11:19.766 --> 11:21.985
when the Angel appeared to me
are a result

11:22.029 --> 11:24.553
of Control evolving,
achieving consciousness.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.990
Let'’s assume for a moment
I am the Red Angel.

11:27.034 --> 11:30.037
If I knew about an apocalypse,
why wouldn'’t I say so?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.169
Perhaps you simply have
a penchant for the dramatic.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.693
Okay.

11:33.736 --> 11:34.955
SPOCK:
The suit was emitting

11:34.998 --> 11:36.304
tetryonic radiation,
which would limit

11:36.347 --> 11:38.001
traditional radio
and sensor communication.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.568
That would explain
my difficulties

11:39.611 --> 11:41.265
in mind-melding with it.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.529
And why it put seven signals
in the sky.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.054
It was trying to get Starfleet'’s
attention, maybe to warn us.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.055
BURNHAM:
But the first
three signals

11:48.098 --> 11:49.621
appeared on the asteroid,

11:49.665 --> 11:51.014
Terralysium, and Kaminar,

11:51.058 --> 11:52.929
with four left
to reveal themselves.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.062
If I'’m guiding Starfleet

11:55.105 --> 11:56.846
to these specific places

11:56.890 --> 12:00.284
on some sort of path, why?

12:00.328 --> 12:02.809
What do these locations
have in common?

12:02.852 --> 12:04.985
SARU :
Admiral. Captain.
We'’ve just received word

12:05.028 --> 12:07.422
that a Section 31 vessel
is on its way.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.957
The Federation has cleared
Discovery,Lieutenant Spock

12:21.001 --> 12:22.350
and Commander Burnham
of all charges.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.744
If you came all this way
to arrest somebody,

12:24.787 --> 12:26.397
you wasted a trip.

12:26.441 --> 12:27.790
We'’re aware, Admiral.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.183
Chris, I'’m sorry

12:29.226 --> 12:30.793
for the loss of
your crew member.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.273
We'’re here to make sure
nothing else from the future

12:32.316 --> 12:33.753
can attack the Federation.

12:33.796 --> 12:34.928
We'’re already working
on a strategy.

12:34.971 --> 12:35.842
GEORGIOU:
In other words,

12:35.885 --> 12:37.321
you'’re accumulating input,

12:37.365 --> 12:38.801
which only invites debate.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.760
No debate, no innovation.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.066
I prefer a little
totalitarian efficiency,

12:43.110 --> 12:44.546
but that'’s me.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.069
LELAND:
Admiral,

12:46.113 --> 12:47.201
we have a solution.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.811
I'’m cringing already.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.031
The Angel is the only one
with answers about the future,

12:51.074 --> 12:53.033
the A.I.
and perhaps how to stop it.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.600
And we can'’t predict
when or how it will appear.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.299
Correct. So...

12:58.342 --> 13:00.214
we set a trap,
we capture it

13:00.257 --> 13:02.825
and make it work for us.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.174
The Red Angel'’s
bio-neural signature

13:04.218 --> 13:05.959
was hidden inside Airiam'’s data

13:06.002 --> 13:08.004
in a file called
Project Daedalus.

13:08.048 --> 13:11.268
Are you absolutely certain
it was a match to Michael?

13:11.312 --> 13:13.314
It'’s me.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.969
SARU:
As the Angel travels
through time,

13:16.012 --> 13:18.101
she opens a micro-wormhole

13:18.145 --> 13:20.974
along with the possibility that
a future A.I. will follow her.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.627
We can'’t let that happen again.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.281
Agreed. Which is why
we have to stop her

13:24.325 --> 13:25.630
from traveling
back and forth.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.415
We have to capture her.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.112
Me.

13:29.156 --> 13:33.769
So, how do you propose
we trap her?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.251
20 years ago,
we discovered the Klingons

13:37.294 --> 13:39.122
were researching time travel.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.517
Obviously a critical
threat-- a warrior race

13:42.560 --> 13:44.736
with the ability to rewrite
the past and shape the future?

13:44.780 --> 13:46.608
They'’d have wiped us out

13:46.651 --> 13:49.089
before we could even walk
out of the primordial soup.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.655
No offense.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.135
None taken.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.050
They would'’ve.

13:54.094 --> 13:56.139
LELAND:
We found ourselves

13:56.183 --> 13:58.707
in a temporal arms race, so
to gain a strategic advantage,

13:58.750 --> 13:59.839
we developed
"The Daedalus Project."

14:01.666 --> 14:03.146
It'’s ours.

14:05.322 --> 14:08.456
Section 31'’s grand
design for time travel.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.675
You created the Red Angel?

14:10.719 --> 14:12.677
The suit was on the
verge of being tested

14:12.721 --> 14:14.636
when it was destroyed
by Klingon spies.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.986
We thought they had abandoned
the project permanently.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.683
Until the signals began.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.120
LELAND:
Once the suit appeared
alongside the signals,

14:20.163 --> 14:22.557
we started working
on a way to capture it.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.561
A mousetrap, if you will,
to get our technology back.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.477
And the individual
using that technology?

14:29.520 --> 14:32.697
She will not be harmed.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.699
There are gaps in your story
that I find disconcerting.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.179
I'’ve told you everything
you need to know.

14:36.223 --> 14:39.052
Not if I'’m the mission, sir.Burnham.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.228
GEORGIOU:
I have the technical
specifications

14:41.271 --> 14:44.274
and a list
of, uh, equipment required.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.495
Provided I may borrow some of
your top minds to build it.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.497
You can work with Commander
Stamets. He'’s one of our best.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.194
SPOCK:
Even if they succeed,

14:51.238 --> 14:52.717
there is still the matter
of predicting

14:52.761 --> 14:54.241
the Angel'’s next appearance.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.590
She has not
consistently accompanied

14:55.633 --> 14:56.896
the arrival of the signals.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.854
Signal or no signal,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.638
there has to be a pattern
to my jumps.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.859
And once we find it,
we'’ll find me.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.470
I'’ll figure out a way to close
the wormhole once she gets here.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.820
The graviton beams on our ship
should be powerful enough.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.258
I would be happy to assist you

15:11.301 --> 15:12.912
with the calculations,
Captain Leland.

15:15.001 --> 15:15.915
Admiral?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.048
Let'’s go build a mousetrap.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.843
BURNHAM:
Georgiou, wait.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.193
What aren'’t you telling me?

15:33.236 --> 15:35.021
How many times
have you asked me that?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.413
Aren'’t you getting bored?

15:36.457 --> 15:37.980
I'’ll stop asking when it
stops being a question.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.634
I know there'’s more to
that Daedalus story.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.114
We shared
what we needed to share.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.420
At least, I have.Philippa.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.729
I'’m putting my life
in your hands.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.949
You asked for my trust.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.907
I'’m giving you a way to earn it.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.823
I'’m not the one
with the information

15:54.866 --> 15:56.564
you need to hear, Michael.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.870
Leland?

15:58.914 --> 16:02.526
It'’s my experience
it'’s often our best intentions

16:02.570 --> 16:04.920
that cause us
to do the most harm,

16:04.964 --> 16:07.140
especially to those we care for.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.409
STAMETS:
This is the Red Angel.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.498
A suit that lets someone travel
through time

16:17.541 --> 16:19.108
via micro-wormholes.

16:19.152 --> 16:22.068
But wormholes
are inherently unstable,

16:22.111 --> 16:23.765
so the Angel
needs to hold them open

16:23.808 --> 16:25.680
or she won'’t be able
to get home again.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.247
And as I understand it,

16:27.290 --> 16:29.510
to keep the wormhole open,
the suit generates

16:29.553 --> 16:33.296
a membrane, a protective
layer that travels with her,

16:33.340 --> 16:34.906
and one end stays attached

16:34.950 --> 16:36.517
to her starting
point in the future.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.953
An anchor.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.868
When she wants to go home,
it snaps her back

16:39.911 --> 16:41.261
like a rubber band.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.697
TILLY:
Our phase discriminators

16:42.740 --> 16:44.873
will hold the Angel
in stasis beams

16:44.916 --> 16:47.049
so the membrane
can'’t snap her back.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.964
And then we'’ll lower
her to a platform,

16:49.008 --> 16:50.966
where an electromagnetic pulse

16:51.010 --> 16:53.795
will shut down the time crystal
that powers her suit.

16:53.838 --> 16:54.926
STAMETS:
And, uh, then we

16:54.970 --> 16:56.493
raise the containment field,

16:56.537 --> 17:00.019
and that will hold her here
for as long as we want.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.760
And then, uh,
we can question her,

17:02.804 --> 17:05.459
and nothing from the future
will be able to reach us. Right?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.027
What'’s that look on your face?

17:08.069 --> 17:09.637
I was thinking you may be

17:09.680 --> 17:12.248
smarter than the Stamets I knew.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.337
You'’re also much more neurotic.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.685
Have you considered medication?

17:17.862 --> 17:20.430
Um, based on my calculations,

17:20.473 --> 17:23.215
the phase discriminators
should function properly.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.131
The problem is...

17:31.311 --> 17:32.877
Uh, hey, Tilly.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.096
Is, um, Admiral Cornwell here?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.445
I thought she might be...

17:35.489 --> 17:37.273
TILLY:
Yeah. What? No, she'’s not.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.405
No, but it is... it'’s great...

17:38.448 --> 17:39.623
uh, so great that you'’re here.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.799
Please, your wide-eyed attempt

17:41.843 --> 17:44.585
to release
this fabulous male tension

17:44.628 --> 17:46.108
is a buzzkill.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.631
You never learned to relish

17:47.675 --> 17:49.459
a little discomfort, Red?

17:49.503 --> 17:50.634
Who raised you?

17:50.678 --> 17:51.940
My-my mom. My mom.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.159
But she wasn'’t around a lot.Stop talking.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.468
You said
there was a problem, Paul?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.905
Uh, yes, with the...
the phase discriminators.

18:00.949 --> 18:04.605
Uh, we'’d need the equivalent
of 12 warp cores

18:04.648 --> 18:06.520
to generate enough energy
to-to run them,

18:06.563 --> 18:08.435
and if we can even locate

18:08.478 --> 18:11.133
that much power, it will be
almost impossible to control.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.917
Not for you.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.963
In fact,
we don'’t need warp cores.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.878
One of the Project
Daedalus testing sites

18:16.921 --> 18:19.402
was on Essof Four.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.187
Y-Yes, I'’ve read
about that place.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.189
So much deuterium.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.321
We can use it to create
a plasma reactor

18:25.365 --> 18:26.975
to power up
our phase discriminators.

18:27.018 --> 18:30.544
And then, snap,
we have our mouse.

18:30.587 --> 18:34.548
You are savvier than he was.CULBER:
Um...

18:34.591 --> 18:37.028
you-you do know that
he'’s gay, right?

18:37.072 --> 18:38.291
Don'’t be so binary.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.424
In my universe,
he was pansexual,

18:41.468 --> 18:45.036
and we had DEFCON-level
fun together.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.212
And you, too, Papi.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.952
Did you just call me Papi?

18:47.996 --> 18:50.216
Uh, well, in my universe

18:50.259 --> 18:53.915
and pretty much any universe
I can possibly imagine,

18:53.958 --> 18:55.177
I'’m gay.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.440
And so is he.Of course you are.

18:57.484 --> 18:58.876
I'’m glad we all see

18:58.920 --> 19:00.356
what'’s right in front of us.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.837
And now, if you'’ll excuse me,

19:02.880 --> 19:04.752
I need to talk to Captain Pike
about setting a course

19:04.795 --> 19:07.233
for Essof Four.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.844
What just happened?

19:09.887 --> 19:11.933
Commander.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.544
Hey.I just...

19:14.588 --> 19:16.938
Look,

19:16.981 --> 19:19.723
my job is to preserve
as many lives as possible

19:19.767 --> 19:22.248
at any cost.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.728
But what you said
at the service...

19:24.772 --> 19:27.992
It is hard to let go.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.692
You did the right thing.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.477
I'’m grateful you were there.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.393
Strange way to get
to know someone, but...

19:37.437 --> 19:39.482
after seeing how hard
you fought for her,

19:39.526 --> 19:41.267
the real her...

19:43.573 --> 19:46.272
Let'’s just say I'm grateful
you were there, too.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.147
SARU:
The wormhole used

19:52.191 --> 19:54.845
by the Red Angel would close
on its own eventually,

19:54.889 --> 19:57.500
but we must find a way
to force it closed immediately

19:57.544 --> 19:59.720
or risk
another A.I. infiltration.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.113
Unfortunately,
Discovery'’sgraviton beam

20:02.157 --> 20:03.724
is not powerful enough to...

20:03.767 --> 20:05.813
Which is why I said
I'’d do it from my ship.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.815
I'’ll have Specialist
Tyler help.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.469
We'’ll close it fast.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.949
Did Captain Pike decide

20:11.993 --> 20:13.299
that I needed a monitor?

20:13.342 --> 20:14.387
Is that why you'’re here?

20:16.780 --> 20:18.913
I chose to work with you

20:18.956 --> 20:21.176
because I wanted
to assess you myself.

20:22.308 --> 20:25.311
Section 31 has engaged

20:25.354 --> 20:28.183
in questionable practices
of late.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.793
Given that we will be
working together

20:29.837 --> 20:34.189
and the lives of those
I care for may be in your hands,

20:34.233 --> 20:37.584
I need to know
that you can be trusted.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.978
If you can tell the answer,
I'’m not doing my job very well.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.024
Even without my ganglia,

20:43.067 --> 20:46.070
I still have
strong instinctive reactions

20:46.114 --> 20:49.422
to dangerous situations
and individuals.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.553
And?

20:50.597 --> 20:53.077
I believe you will work

20:53.121 --> 20:54.818
to protect your crew and ours

20:54.862 --> 20:56.211
to the very best
of your ability.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.780
I also believe

20:59.823 --> 21:02.348
there are many things
you are not saying.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.134
Excuse me.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.223
Mr. Saru.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.530
May I have a moment
with Captain Leland, please?

21:10.573 --> 21:13.315
Certainly, Commander.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.105
Captain, we'’re preparing
a strategy to capture me.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.673
I have a right
to know everything you do.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.546
As in everything you know.

21:26.589 --> 21:30.289
You are capable of some
intricate moral gymnastics.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.942
And that'’s your job, right?

21:31.986 --> 21:34.467
But I am giving you
one chance

21:34.510 --> 21:36.686
to explain everything
as you need to explain it.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.263
I knew your parents.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.355
They worked on Project
Daedalus for Section 31.

21:55.183 --> 21:58.012
I had them stationed
on Doctari Alpha.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.494
No.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.191
We were stationed there

22:03.234 --> 22:05.367
because my parents wanted
a change of scenery.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.195
And we only stayed
as long as we did

22:07.238 --> 22:09.023
because I wanted to see
a star go supernova.

22:09.066 --> 22:13.680
You were there... because of me.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.682
Your parents...

22:17.553 --> 22:19.816
Your parents
were killed there...

22:19.860 --> 22:21.470
because of me.

22:24.865 --> 22:29.435
My parents... were scientists.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.567
My father was
a xenoanthropologist.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.874
My mother was an astrophysicist.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.267
They wouldn'’t have been involved
in Section 31.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.269
She was also an engineer.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.184
A brilliant one.

22:42.578 --> 22:45.146
They were working on a theory
that sudden technological leaps

22:45.189 --> 22:47.104
across certain cultures,
including those on Earth,

22:47.148 --> 22:49.368
weren'’t happenstance

22:49.411 --> 22:51.326
but the result of time travel.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.936
No. They would have known
that certain leaps,

22:52.980 --> 22:54.416
including
technological advancements,

22:54.460 --> 22:55.504
can be explained.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.114
I wasn'’t convinced, either.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.377
Until they built the suit.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.118
No.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.425
No, they didn'’t mention
anything like this to me.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.427
Because it was classified.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.038
And very dangerous.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.606
What did you have to do
with this?

23:10.650 --> 23:13.522
The suit was missing a key
component: a time crystal,

23:13.566 --> 23:15.916
the element that would enable
it to jump through time.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.919
We got intel from an
operative on Qo'’noS

23:18.962 --> 23:21.574
that a time crystal had
hit the black market

23:21.617 --> 23:23.750
near the Orion Outpost.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.535
I used my assets in
the sector to steal it.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.886
See, I thought
that we had made it untraceable.

23:29.930 --> 23:33.455
But the Klingons tracked it
to Doctari Alpha.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.152
Where a star
was about to go supernova,

23:35.196 --> 23:36.502
releasing a massive amount
of energy.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.084
This whole time...

23:56.652 --> 23:58.524
I thought...

24:05.618 --> 24:07.837
We were there because of you?

24:07.881 --> 24:09.578
For a time crystal?

24:11.928 --> 24:14.496
And you let
the Klingons track it?

24:14.540 --> 24:17.847
I was young,
I was ambitious, I...

24:17.891 --> 24:20.502
I was careless.

24:20.546 --> 24:23.070
I should have done more
to protect your parents.

24:23.113 --> 24:27.204
I know how much this has
cost you, and I'’m so sorry.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.382
I hope...

24:31.426 --> 24:32.427
That'’s for my mom.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.258
That'’s for my dad.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.833
This isn'’t over.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.763
I just uploaded all
the Section 31 signal data.Did you know?

25:03.806 --> 25:06.287
Know what?That Leland was responsible
for the death of my parents.

25:07.593 --> 25:08.681
You knew, didn'’t you?

25:08.724 --> 25:10.421
No.Don'’t lie to me, Ash.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.684
Michael, I don'’t know
what you'’re talking about.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.557
Every moment
you work for Section 31,

25:15.601 --> 25:17.124
you'’re announcing who you are.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.521
You'’re saying this is your
compass, this is your course.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.133
You can live with that?

25:27.830 --> 25:31.704
Section 31 has
a specific mission.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.706
I don'’t always agree
with their tactics,

25:33.749 --> 25:35.577
but I do believe
in their mission.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.753
No matter who pays the price?It'’s not black-and-white.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.276
They-they also do a lot of good.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.584
I'’ll take that as a "yes."

25:46.153 --> 25:47.763
Come.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.639
Admiral, uh,
they said you were here.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.031
Do you have a moment?

25:56.206 --> 25:57.599
I do.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.432
You, uh, used to be
a therapist.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.653
Yes, I'’m aware.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.093
What'’s on your mind, Doctor?

26:15.008 --> 26:16.618
Doctor.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.492
I can understand how that
might sound strange to you.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.799
I would assume

26:23.843 --> 26:26.323
everything
is strange to you now.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.717
Your experience
transcends

26:28.761 --> 26:30.632
everything we know
about identity.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.637
I'’ve never felt more alone
in my life.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.598
Even sitting here.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.038
Commander Stamets is the person
who knew you most profoundly.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.909
You used the past tense.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.737
Well, you are... new.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.525
I remember Paul.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.615
I remember loving him,

26:56.658 --> 26:58.704
but if feels like a dream.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.881
It'’s someone else's life.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.971
And I don'’t know
what I feel about him now.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.756
Do you feel pressure
to feel something?

27:07.800 --> 27:09.584
I can'’t give him what he needs.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.328
And I don'’t want to hurt him.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.504
All right. You know that.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.419
You know you don'’t want
to hurt him.That'’s not enough.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.899
Enough for what?

27:19.942 --> 27:21.509
Enough for the man
I know loves me.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.731
And who I once loved.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.300
Love is a choice...

27:30.344 --> 27:33.739
Hugh, and one doesn'’t just
make that choice once.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.567
One makes it again and again.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.181
I'’ll let you
get back to it.

27:42.748 --> 27:43.836
Doctor.

27:45.751 --> 27:49.145
The only way to make a new road

27:49.189 --> 27:50.843
is to walk it.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.893
Thank you, Admiral.

28:09.426 --> 28:12.473
SPOCK:
I'’m sure Captain Leland
appreciates your choice

28:12.516 --> 28:15.084
of high-density urethane foam
in lieu of his nasal cartilage.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.999
Spock, no offense,
but you'’re the last person

28:17.043 --> 28:18.740
I want to talk to right now.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.525
You are angry.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.397
An understandable reaction.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.051
You lost your friend.

28:25.094 --> 28:26.530
Knowing her death
was unavoidable

28:26.574 --> 28:28.010
would not provide solace.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.751
You also learned
that you are the Red Angel,

28:29.795 --> 28:31.318
which does not make
logical sense despite

28:31.361 --> 28:32.754
its correlation
to your emotional profile.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.190
Spock...

28:34.234 --> 28:35.888
Finally,

28:35.931 --> 28:37.411
you discovered
your parents were killed

28:37.454 --> 28:38.804
because of Captain Leland'’s
negligence,

28:38.847 --> 28:40.414
which does not make their loss

28:40.457 --> 28:41.589
any more acceptable.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.028
I do wish I'’d been there
when you struck him.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.465
I believe I would have
found the moment...

28:48.509 --> 28:49.902
satisfying.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.703
You have experienced
a series of events

29:08.747 --> 29:12.794
in which both emotion
and logic have failed you.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.492
In my experience of this,
it is...

29:17.581 --> 29:18.844
...uncomfortable.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.238
Very.

29:31.944 --> 29:34.685
What you said about...

29:34.729 --> 29:37.819
me always finding a
way to blame myself...

29:39.560 --> 29:41.388
You are right.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.784
I brought my guilt
into your home.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.266
I'’m sorry.

29:51.877 --> 29:55.402
You were a child...

29:55.445 --> 29:58.405
with a child'’s understanding
of an event

29:58.448 --> 30:01.060
that even adults
would struggle to comprehend.

30:04.454 --> 30:07.240
However, if it will

30:07.283 --> 30:09.372
ease your suffering,

30:09.416 --> 30:11.722
I accept your apology.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.696
Thank you for coming
to talk to me.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.393
It was unexpected.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.875
And helpful.

30:36.051 --> 30:39.881
I had not anticipated
this conversation, either,

30:39.925 --> 30:41.927
but I appreciate it, as well.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.371
So, why did you come
to see me, then?

30:53.590 --> 30:55.766
In your absence,
I made a discovery.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.378
I now understand the variance
in the signal patterns--

30:58.421 --> 31:01.337
what causes the Angel to appear
at certain times and not others.

31:01.381 --> 31:03.209
And?

31:03.252 --> 31:06.342
The variance is you, Michael.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.391
We don'’t have to wait.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.219
We can set the trap directly
on Essof Four.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.525
PIKE:
The plan was to power the
trap there and take it

31:15.569 --> 31:17.136
wherever we find the Angel.
What'’s changed?

31:17.179 --> 31:18.877
We'’ve been trying to track her
by the signals,

31:18.920 --> 31:20.182
asking when
she might appear somewhere.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.054
But what we should have been
asking is why.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.186
Why does she appear
where she does?

31:24.230 --> 31:25.448
Each signal brought
Discoveryto

31:25.492 --> 31:27.494
a location where
lives were saved.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.757
The Angel appeared at some of
those locations, but not all.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.020
Leaving no clear pattern
to suggest intent.

31:32.064 --> 31:34.109
However, there is a pattern
to her appearances

31:34.153 --> 31:36.068
without any signal.

31:36.111 --> 31:38.809
As when Spock was a boy and it
warned him that I was in danger,

31:38.853 --> 31:42.639
when it appeared to me on the
asteroid when I was injured,

31:42.683 --> 31:43.989
seeing it gave me strength,

31:44.032 --> 31:45.120
knowing that help was
on the way.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.556
You were saving your own life.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.993
The Grandfather Paradox.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.385
Future Burnham would not exist

31:49.429 --> 31:51.213
if Present Burnham were
to perish.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.780
When Michael'’s life
was in danger,

31:52.823 --> 31:54.434
her guardian Red Angel
intervenes.

31:54.477 --> 31:57.176
Which means
I have to be the bait.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.047
What does that mean exactly?

31:59.091 --> 32:00.701
The place doesn'’t have
a breathable atmosphere.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.659
We set a trap, I go down.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.226
You let me start to suffocate.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.707
Are you insane?Absolutely not.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.056
The Angel will protect her,
Captain,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.319
or her efforts to
communicate with us,

32:10.363 --> 32:12.321
to save the galaxy,
would be for naught.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.280
And if anything were
to not go as planned,

32:14.323 --> 32:16.499
Dr. Culber will be right there
to resuscitate me.

32:16.543 --> 32:19.807
But we do not believe he will
ultimately be necessary.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.896
I'’m not looking forward to it,
Captain-- far from it--

32:21.940 --> 32:23.985
but we do not see any other way.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.814
What you are asking me to allow

32:26.857 --> 32:28.598
is in direct opposition

32:28.642 --> 32:30.818
to the oath I took
as a Starfleet captain.

32:30.861 --> 32:33.168
I understand,
but with all due respect,

32:33.212 --> 32:36.084
between risking myself
and risking all sentient life,

32:36.128 --> 32:38.391
there is no choice.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.610
Captain, if we'’re going
to capture the Red Angel,

32:40.654 --> 32:42.264
you have to let me die.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.366
SPOCK:
To call Essof Four inhospitable

32:57.410 --> 32:58.889
would be
a gross understatement.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.674
Temperatures
fluctuate wildly.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.502
And its carbon monoxide
atmosphere

33:02.545 --> 33:03.807
is laced with
perchlorate dust

33:03.851 --> 33:05.287
which will quickly
prove lethal

33:05.331 --> 33:07.159
to any oxygen-breathing
life-form.

33:07.202 --> 33:10.162
But the facility itself
has oxygen, doesn'’t it?

33:10.205 --> 33:11.554
That is correct.

33:14.818 --> 33:18.909
GEORGIOU:
So we'’re going to the
Ninth Circle of Hell to capture

33:18.953 --> 33:20.911
a Red Angel.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.479
I'’d enjoy the irony of that
if this weren'’t so dangerous.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.316
Commander Stamets,

33:34.360 --> 33:36.144
your work must
be precise.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.928
We have to succeed
on the first attempt.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.713
We won'’t have
another opportunity.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.454
Once Commander Burnham is
strapped into that chair,

33:41.497 --> 33:43.195
the roof will recede,

33:43.238 --> 33:45.806
she'’ll be exposed
to the toxic atmosphere,

33:45.849 --> 33:48.765
and she will have exactly
two minutes to live.

33:48.809 --> 33:51.681
And she'’ll suffocate...
painfully.

33:56.817 --> 33:59.124
PIKE:
Dr. Culber, be prepared

33:59.167 --> 34:01.039
to breach the target
area and resuscitate.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.389
I will. Don'’t worry, sir.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.434
SPOCK:
But you cannot
revive her too early,

34:05.478 --> 34:07.132
or the Angel will not appear.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.177
And if she does not,

34:09.221 --> 34:11.918
we will lose much more than
the life of Michael Burnham.

34:15.226 --> 34:17.315
All sentient life will be lost.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.061
Hey.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.235
May I come in?

34:24.279 --> 34:26.194
Yeah.

34:31.764 --> 34:33.984
I'’m glad you're here.

34:34.027 --> 34:35.594
You have to know,
what happened to your parents...

34:35.638 --> 34:37.771
Please don'’t apologize.

34:37.813 --> 34:39.815
What I said to you was not fair.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.123
I was angry,

34:42.167 --> 34:43.994
and I didn'’t know
where to put it.

34:46.822 --> 34:49.652
I think you put it where
you knew it would be okay.

34:49.696 --> 34:52.655
I don'’t... I don't want that
to be our last conversation

34:52.699 --> 34:54.744
if, um...

34:54.788 --> 34:57.051
No, don'’t even think that way.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.922
This will work.

35:00.707 --> 35:03.884
You have an entire crew
dedicated to saving your life.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.279
You have me.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.823
I'’m scared.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.783
Me, too.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.670
Captain, the facility
is prepped and ready.

35:50.713 --> 35:51.975
The away team
is on site.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.298
Welcome to the bridge,
Lieutenant Nilsson.

36:10.342 --> 36:11.169
Standing by, Captain.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.525
STAMETS:
Bringing phase discriminators
online.

36:26.401 --> 36:29.926
We didn'’t get a chance to
talk at Airiam'’s funeral.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.320
I just...
wanted to say I'’m sorry.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.583
Thank you.

36:34.627 --> 36:35.845
Paul...

36:35.889 --> 36:37.020
This isn'’t the time.

36:38.848 --> 36:41.634
Might not ever be the time.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.690
Are you ready?

36:54.734 --> 36:56.692
As I'’ll ever be.

36:56.736 --> 36:58.433
Michael Burnham,

36:58.477 --> 37:00.305
always willing
to sacrifice everything

37:00.348 --> 37:01.915
for the good of others.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.310
We'’ll monitor exposure time

37:05.353 --> 37:07.355
from the moment
the roof retracts.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.577
Why didn'’t you just tell me
about my parents?

37:14.884 --> 37:17.409
It wasn'’t my story to tell.

37:17.452 --> 37:20.063
But I could make certain
it was told.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.156
I got to go.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.491
Let us hope the Angel
lives up to her name.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.145
Captain Leland,

37:58.188 --> 37:59.799
are you and Mr. Tyler ready
to go?

37:59.842 --> 38:01.496
Standing by to close the
wormhole in the Angel'’s wake.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.889
Make it fast.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.282
Trust me,
the last thing I want

38:04.325 --> 38:06.196
is another A.I.
infecting our systems.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.330
Michael...

38:12.551 --> 38:14.466
I know, Ash.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.776
What if it doesn'’t work?

39:09.738 --> 39:12.567
Were you to perish,

39:12.611 --> 39:15.570
I would be charged with killing
a Starfleet officer.

39:15.614 --> 39:16.658
Again.

39:19.618 --> 39:22.360
It would therefore be ideal

39:22.403 --> 39:23.622
if you survived.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.670
Such a way with words, Spock.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.692
On your mark, Commander.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.227
Ready.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.664
Shutting down life support.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.364
Starting timer now.

40:12.018 --> 40:13.454
PIKE:
Two minutes and counting.

41:01.937 --> 41:05.245
Oxygen saturation
level'’s at 85%,

41:05.288 --> 41:06.725
and falling fast.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.335
If it drops below 40,
she won'’t make it.

41:08.378 --> 41:09.597
Ensign Tilly,
tachyon update.

41:12.426 --> 41:14.950
Ensign, are you picking up any
spikes in the tachyon radiation?

41:14.994 --> 41:16.343
Sorry, sir.
Um, no change.

41:18.867 --> 41:19.868
What if she isn'’t coming?

41:30.139 --> 41:32.185
CULBER:
Oxygen saturation
is down to 62%.

41:32.228 --> 41:33.708
Heart rate spiking.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.886
GEORGIOU:
She wants out.

41:37.930 --> 41:39.105
It'’s over.

41:39.148 --> 41:41.629
We'’re coming to get you,
Michael.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.065
Wait. She'’s saying something.

41:44.806 --> 41:46.765
Var-Var...

41:46.808 --> 41:48.331
Variance.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.637
She said "variance."

41:49.681 --> 41:50.725
I don'’t give a damn
what she said.

41:50.769 --> 41:52.727
Get the oxygen.
Follow me.

41:52.771 --> 41:53.946
Michael means that
she is the variance.

41:53.989 --> 41:55.730
She is creating a
situation where

41:55.774 --> 41:57.645
the Red Angel will have
no choice but to save her.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.734
That thing is not coming,

41:59.778 --> 42:01.475
and Michael
is shaking her head no!

42:01.519 --> 42:03.346
SPOCK:
Because she does not
want interference.

42:03.390 --> 42:04.957
We must let it proceed.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.393
Oxygen is down to 42%.

42:06.436 --> 42:07.437
If I don'’t get to her,
she'’ll die.

42:07.481 --> 42:08.569
Yes, Doctor.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.571
That is the idea.

42:16.272 --> 42:17.317
Status reports.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.232
No change in
tachyon levels.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.929
Sensors stable on my end, too.

42:20.973 --> 42:22.452
No sign of the
Red Angel.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.501
Your call.

42:32.985 --> 42:35.074
PIKE:
This operation is over.
Away team, get her out of there.

42:35.117 --> 42:36.292
We can'’t, sir.

42:36.336 --> 42:37.642
Lieutenant Spock is

42:37.685 --> 42:39.600
holding us hostage.
Says we have to let her die.

42:39.644 --> 42:41.080
PIKE:
Damn it, Spock, stand down!

42:41.123 --> 42:42.560
I'’m sorry, Captain.
I cannot.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.692
PIKE:
Spock, stand down!
That'’s an order!

42:44.736 --> 42:47.739
SPOCK:
I am sorry, Captain. I cannot.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.466
Ops, beam Commander Burnham
directly to sickbay now.

43:21.816 --> 43:22.948
I can'’t, Captain.
There'’s too much interference

43:22.991 --> 43:24.166
to get a lock on her.

43:24.210 --> 43:25.211
Interference from what?

43:25.254 --> 43:26.952
I'’m detecting a massive surge

43:26.995 --> 43:28.475
in tachyon radiation.

43:34.176 --> 43:35.395
Captain!

43:35.438 --> 43:38.224
Get us over there! Now!

43:38.267 --> 43:38.964
Shields up. Red alert.

43:41.357 --> 43:42.010
Get ready, Spock.

43:50.889 --> 43:51.585
It'’s coming.

43:54.719 --> 43:56.459
I need eyes.Working on it.

44:07.166 --> 44:10.256
I'’m having trouble stabilizing
the beam. I need more power!

44:10.299 --> 44:13.215
Keep firing. I'’ll override
the security buffers.

44:13.259 --> 44:14.652
Get that damn thing closed
as soon as you can!

44:33.932 --> 44:34.846
Now!

44:45.291 --> 44:47.554
Authorizing
security buffer override.

44:47.597 --> 44:49.556
COMPUTER:
System offline.

44:49.599 --> 44:51.689
Tyler, I need...

44:51.732 --> 44:53.255
System online.Never mind.

44:53.299 --> 44:55.823
Authorizing
security buffer override.

44:55.867 --> 44:57.042
Working.

44:57.085 --> 44:59.261
Let'’s go. It is not that hard.

44:59.305 --> 45:00.741
Let'’s go. Let's go.

45:00.785 --> 45:02.003
It is not that hard.

45:08.793 --> 45:10.795
Tyler, you should have
the power you need now.

45:14.146 --> 45:15.016
Wormhole'’s closed!

45:18.324 --> 45:19.847
Reengaging atmosphere.

45:30.118 --> 45:31.729
Systems back up.

45:34.209 --> 45:35.341
Can you get out there
to Burnham?

45:35.384 --> 45:36.646
Not yet. It'’s not safe.

45:43.088 --> 45:43.828
Firing EMP.

45:53.489 --> 45:54.490
We have
the Red Angel.

45:54.534 --> 45:55.840
Raising containment field now.

46:27.088 --> 46:28.611
Mom?
