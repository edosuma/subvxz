actually told me to die

There's a connection. You were
the Crown Prosecutor, right?

10:00.640 --> 10:00.930
I was, yeah.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.560
I hear Clarke had business
dealings with Bikers.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.060
And we suspect they may
have had him killed.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.230
Last I checked, Jake was the one
holding the murder weapon.

10:12.320 --> 10:12.570
Thanks for the shirt.

10:13.690 --> 10:15.690
I'll try not to bleed
through it much.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.360
You need to turn yourselves in.

10:18.610 --> 10:18.860
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.370
Was Clarke tangled
up with Bikers? We need to know.

10:22.410 --> 10:24.080
This is madness. Do you want
Nikki to go to jail

10:24.120 --> 10:25.700
because of you?
Just leave.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.330
David. Jake may be a lot
of things, babe.

10:28.370 --> 10:29.790
But he is not a killer.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.420
You know that. And I know that.

10:31.460 --> 10:31.750
They're fugitives.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.960
Please. If you know
something about this-

10:35.010 --> 10:36.380
You have to tell them.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.720
Okay.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.590
Okay, we had reason

10:39.630 --> 10:40.720
to believe that Bill Clarke was-

10:41.890 --> 10:44.180
that he had info on the
bikers. Evidence-

10:44.220 --> 10:46.020
he was using to
protect himself.

10:46.060 --> 10:48.480
Why didn't you pursue
that further?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.940
We did. That info coulda brought
down a lot of Bikers.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.940
They're connected to a slew
of crime in the city.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.690
We couldn't get the warrants
we needed.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.110
That's no surprise.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.610
We know that Tizzard is in the

10:57.650 --> 10:59.200
pocket of the Bikers.
And probably-

10:59.240 --> 11:01.110
a bunch of influential
people as well.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.660
So, Clarke gets out.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.910
And threatens Rhodes
with this evidence.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.790
And then he orders
Brogan to kill Clarke.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.630
Did you call the cops on me?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.210
- Babe.
- I'm sorry. I had to.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.130
I can't jeopardize our family.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.970
Just turn yourselves in.
Maybe I can help.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.600
Yeah, unless you got a load of
evidence,

11:23.640 --> 11:24.680
no one can help me now.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.480
- We gotta go.
- Thomas Plaskett.

11:29.020 --> 11:29.230
Who's that?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.060
He was,
linked to all this.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.730
Maybe he can give you
the info you need.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.440
Jake.
Be careful. Please.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.530
Thank you.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.160
Ughh!

11:48.910 --> 11:49.790
Come on now, skipper.

11:50.580 --> 11:51.080
This is enough of this.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.250
Just tell Rhodes what
he wants to know-

11:54.290 --> 11:55.460
Old man?

11:56.460 --> 11:57.340
Skipper?

11:59.210 --> 11:59.510
Someone needs to teach you-

12:00.920 --> 12:03.260
how to talk to people of the
older generation, son.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.180
[spit]

12:04.680 --> 12:04.970
[punch]

12:06.510 --> 12:08.810
Malachy. Your son has been
causing me too many problems.

12:08.850 --> 12:11.140
Yeah, he's a real pain
in the ass.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.850
If you just give
him the evidence

12:13.900 --> 12:14.810
that will clear his name-

12:15.730 --> 12:17.020
He'll be less of a pain then.

12:17.070 --> 12:17.980
I guarantee it.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.400
He knows the deal.

12:22.530 --> 12:22.860
Just shut up.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.320
And do whatever it
is you're planning to do.

12:25.370 --> 12:25.830
To convince him to take it.

12:26.990 --> 12:29.040
I don't think I've
ever seen a family-

12:29.080 --> 12:31.250
so intent on getting killed.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.830
It seems that way, don't it?

12:48.140 --> 12:49.850
You don't have to die.

12:49.890 --> 12:50.970
You're good.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.690
The whole lot of you Doyles are.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.980
So I'm gonna expand my offer.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.650
Convince Jake to work for
me on the inside.

12:59.110 --> 13:02.240
And the rest of you Doyles
can work for me out here.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.410
I don't negotiate
with douche bags.

13:11.740 --> 13:13.790
You're a tough
little nut to crack.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.800
[oomph!]

13:23.090 --> 13:24.340
But we'll break ya.

13:26.260 --> 13:28.340
Thomas Plaskett was Clarke's
Chief of Staff.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.470
We're gonna have to
pay him a little visit.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.310
[phone]

13:31.930 --> 13:32.270
[Des] Nikki?

13:33.890 --> 13:35.980
Miss me, do we? Thinking about
me, are we? I can't blame you.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.770
- How's things?
- Des, it's me.

13:37.810 --> 13:39.570
I'm glad to hear that
you're feeling better.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.610
I really am.

13:40.650 --> 13:41.530
Oh, thanks, Jake.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.030
Jake? Are you okay?

13:44.070 --> 13:44.320
I'm fine.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.780
I need you to track down William
Clarke's old Chief of Staff.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.530
- Can you do that?
- Thomas Plaskett.

13:49.570 --> 13:49.870
Plaskett? I saw
him just before I got

13:51.290 --> 13:51.620
the crap pounded out of me.
He was with an escort.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.700
I can send you pictures on the
phone you're using.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.790
Are the Bikers
blackmailing him? Why?

13:56.830 --> 13:57.120
He's a city planner.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.580
Whatever he did with Clarke
didn't stick to him.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.000
Where can we find him right now?

14:01.040 --> 14:01.300
[Tinny] There's an event today.

14:02.380 --> 14:03.260
The Garden Party
at Government House.

14:03.300 --> 14:03.590
He'll be there for sure.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.170
Alright listen. Get Dad
to meet us there.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.550
He's not answering his phone.

14:07.590 --> 14:08.470
You bet.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.140
Welcome.

14:15.180 --> 14:16.100
Thank you for coming.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.350
Thank you. Thank you.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.360
Jake, we gotta move fast.
Someone's gonna recognize you.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.320
There he is.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.620
Plan?

14:31.660 --> 14:32.530
Something like that.

14:34.450 --> 14:36.080
Get him over to that tent.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.040
Got it.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.930
- Hey there.
- You're Jake Doyle.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.680
- Yeah.
- You're a fugitive.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.480
Yeah, and we need to talk about
your connection with the Bikers.

15:04.650 --> 15:05.530
Hey!

15:07.110 --> 15:07.440
What do you want from me?

15:08.570 --> 15:09.530
The Bikers. They're
blackmailing you.

15:10.490 --> 15:11.910
We've got the proof.

15:13.070 --> 15:13.280
We just wanna know why.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.290
- Where'd you get that?
- Answer the question.

15:16.330 --> 15:18.710
I don't need to talk to you.
You're a fugitive cop.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.500
And you killed my old boss.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.750
So, what do you think I'm
gonna do to you?

15:23.790 --> 15:24.130
Take it easy, okay?

15:25.590 --> 15:27.090
How long have you been in
the pocket of the Bikers?

15:27.130 --> 15:27.380
Don't know what you're
talking about.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.550
Look, we need to know the
info Clarke had

15:30.590 --> 15:30.930
on Rhodes and the Bikers.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.930
And you're gonna tell
us. Or I swear to God-

15:33.970 --> 15:35.310
I'm gonna get really mad.

15:35.350 --> 15:36.350
You're insane.

15:36.390 --> 15:37.930
You have no idea.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.020
- [punch]
- Ugh!

15:42.900 --> 15:44.860
You're just gonna let
him do this to me?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.740
You're right. Jake, stop!

15:50.070 --> 15:50.950
Use these.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.620
Good idea.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.210
Wait, what are you doing?

16:00.250 --> 16:03.130
Just gonna liven
things up a bit.

16:04.210 --> 16:05.340
Come on.

16:06.750 --> 16:07.710
This is a big one.

16:07.750 --> 16:08.630
Right?

16:09.460 --> 16:10.470
Not there, come on.

16:10.510 --> 16:11.760
No.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.560
I bet you're wishing you
weren't a smoker now. Eh b'y?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.430
No, no, no, please don't.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.810
Okay, time to talk

16:22.850 --> 16:23.150
Okay. Okay!

16:24.600 --> 16:26.400
Clarke. He had a bunch of
meetings with the Bikers.

16:26.440 --> 16:26.940
He recorded everything.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.570
He went to jail.
He never said a word.

16:29.610 --> 16:29.900
But then when he go out,

16:31.110 --> 16:32.320
he tried to blackmail them
for some cash.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.570
- So they killed him.
- Exactly.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.570
Where are these recordings?

16:34.610 --> 16:35.320
They were on his phone.

16:35.950 --> 16:37.030
Get the police!

16:38.200 --> 16:39.740
You know, why did you
go and do that?

16:39.790 --> 16:40.870
You two are finished.

16:40.910 --> 16:42.370
The Bikers run this town.

16:42.410 --> 16:43.710
They own everyone.

16:43.750 --> 16:44.710
We gotta go.

16:51.130 --> 16:52.300
[Plaskett]
Help me!

16:52.720 --> 16:53.800
Help me!

16:54.590 --> 16:56.430
They're crazy!

16:58.640 --> 17:02.390
[firework explosion]

17:08.020 --> 17:09.190
What's going on?
What happened?

17:09.230 --> 17:10.400
What's wrong with everyone?

17:10.440 --> 17:11.360
Have you
heard from Malachy?

17:11.400 --> 17:11.740
We know he's in trouble.

17:12.900 --> 17:13.950
We've been trying
to reach him all day.

17:13.990 --> 17:15.320
Call Jake. He has Nikki's cell.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.830
[Leslie] We need to get
Clarke's cell phone.

17:18.870 --> 17:19.950
He could have stored
his recordings

17:19.990 --> 17:21.490
with the Chevaliers on there.

17:21.540 --> 17:21.790
Would there be
any record

17:23.250 --> 17:24.960
on the police data banks as to
where that phone is now?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.670
Yeah, but I don't have
access anymore.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.130
And even if I did, they could
locate my position-

17:29.170 --> 17:30.750
if I logged in.

17:33.590 --> 17:33.920
You alright?

17:35.010 --> 17:36.380
Yeah, I hit my head
a while back.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.890
I had a bit of a concussion.

17:37.930 --> 17:38.260
I'll be fine.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.930
With your banged up head.
And my bloody stomach.

17:42.970 --> 17:43.270
We make quite a pair.
Although-

17:44.680 --> 17:46.480
we're only hurting ourselves,
I s'pose. Hey, b'y.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.770
- I think we need to talk.
- [phone rings]

17:47.810 --> 17:48.270
Hang on for a second.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.150
- Yeah?Dad's missing.

17:51.190 --> 17:51.570
What do you mean, missing?

17:52.690 --> 17:52.940
When was the last time
you saw him?

17:54.030 --> 17:55.030
Last night.
Trust me, I can feel it.

17:55.070 --> 17:55.990
I know he's in real trouble.

17:56.030 --> 17:56.410
Rhodes must have him.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.820
Okay. I'm gonna figure this out.
I'll find him.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.330
Alright. I gotta go.

18:02.290 --> 18:02.620
We gotta find Dad.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.370
But I think I got a plan on how
I can access Clarke's phone.

18:07.290 --> 18:09.170
Okay. I'll go talk to Pickard.

18:09.210 --> 18:12.000
We need his help, especially
if the Bikers have Mal.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.300
Are you sure you can trust him?

18:13.340 --> 18:14.380
No.

18:14.420 --> 18:14.720
What choice do we have?

18:16.050 --> 18:17.590
I'll tell him about Plaskett
and Judge Tizzard.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.220
I'll show him the
blackmail photos.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.180
Pickard can't ignore
this evidence.

18:26.810 --> 18:27.100
It didn't have
to come to this.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.480
Why didn't you just play along
like everyone else?

18:30.520 --> 18:32.400
Not exactly our
style, I'm afraid.

18:32.440 --> 18:32.650
[Rhodes]
I could've used you.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.990
But your death is gonna help
your son see the light.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.990
If you think killing me is gonna
make Jake work for you-

18:38.860 --> 18:40.620
You might wanna think again.

18:40.660 --> 18:41.700
He'll know we do not bluff.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.200
And the idea that I don't
kill the rest of your family

18:45.240 --> 18:46.830
that's gonna help him
see reason.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.120
[smack]

18:48.580 --> 18:49.580
[smack]

18:50.920 --> 18:52.670
Now, now.
I'm gonna need this.

18:53.380 --> 18:54.550
Where are your keys?

18:55.590 --> 18:56.920
I don't remember.

18:56.970 --> 18:57.300
You'll never win.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.380
Everyone from the top
down is involved.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.180
Where's the video?
I don't have time for this.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.600
[bikers]
Hold it right there!

19:06.680 --> 19:07.810
[whack]

19:08.690 --> 19:08.940
Easy now.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.650
- [bang]
- Next one goes in his head.

19:11.690 --> 19:12.900
Drop the guns.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.070
Turn around.

19:24.700 --> 19:25.990
Been a while.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.380
I'm sicker than I thought!
Nurse!

19:38.420 --> 19:39.510
- Shhh!
- Ow!

19:39.550 --> 19:40.880
Des, listen to me.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.840
There is a bunch of
cops outside.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.430
We don't want them to know that
I'm here, now do we?

19:46.060 --> 19:47.270
No. Are you okay?

19:47.310 --> 19:47.560
You're okay?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.640
I'm fine, buddy.
How are you doing?

19:49.680 --> 19:50.940
I'm fine. Let's go.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.600
No, no, no. Shhh.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.860
Just lie back. Okay?

19:54.770 --> 19:56.070
I need your help with something.

19:56.110 --> 19:57.360
Okay. Ow!

19:58.610 --> 19:59.030
Des.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.780
I need you to tap into
the Police Data Base.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.450
See where they're holding Bill
Clarke's personal items.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.410
Try and track his cell phone.

20:06.450 --> 20:06.790
Okay, cool. I'll come with you.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.000
No, no. I need you to this
first. Okay, buddy? Please.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.250
[ring]

20:12.170 --> 20:13.330
This is Des. One second, Jake.

20:13.370 --> 20:14.330
Hello caller.
How are you?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.290
Put Jake on.

20:15.340 --> 20:15.630
Oh. Sure.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.460
Hey, and thanks for asking
how I am, by the way.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.590
- Put Jake on.
- Okay.

20:22.630 --> 20:22.930
What the hell happened to you?

20:24.050 --> 20:24.760
Rhodes. He grabbed me
at the house.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.220
He isn't fooling around.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.390
- How'd you get clear of him? - I have my ways.

20:29.430 --> 20:30.850
We gotta go to the cops.

20:30.890 --> 20:31.140
I'll tell them what happened.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.770
They're not gonna believe
anything you or I say.

20:33.810 --> 20:35.150
We need a knockout punch.

20:35.190 --> 20:35.480
The courthouse.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.360
When Clarke was killed, he
woulda had his cell phone.

20:38.400 --> 20:38.650
It would be entered
into evidence.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.530
Dad, I think I might have
what we're looking for.

20:41.570 --> 20:43.030
I'm gonna head to
the Court House.

20:43.070 --> 20:43.780
I'll meet you there.

20:44.950 --> 20:46.700
- Okay. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

20:46.740 --> 20:48.540
I'm going with you,
okay, so just drop it.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.490
Des-

20:49.540 --> 20:50.410
I'm coming.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.170
- Stay.
- What? No.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.380
Ow, ow, ow!

21:06.640 --> 21:07.890
Des, you little-

21:22.240 --> 21:23.450
What is this?

21:27.910 --> 21:29.830
This is really bad for
me. I don't have any pants.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.290
Like, hello? Pants?

21:33.460 --> 21:33.830
What's the plan?

21:34.870 --> 21:35.120
Give me a minute.
We need to think.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.080
Maybe you can think of a reason
I have an absence of pants.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.380
Oh pants. Oh man, the ring.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.380
What ring?

21:41.630 --> 21:43.510
Ah, [singing] ♪ Ringing in my ears ♪

21:43.550 --> 21:43.840
It went away.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.800
Okay. Wait over there
for a second.

21:51.390 --> 21:52.470
Hood!

21:52.520 --> 21:53.770
What are you doing here, Mal?

21:54.600 --> 21:56.140
Damon Rhodes kidnapped me.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.060
- He's a maniac!
- Is this serious?

21:58.100 --> 22:00.400
You don't think we have enough
on our plates to deal with?

22:00.440 --> 22:01.690
Mal, what happened to you?

22:01.730 --> 22:02.030
I'm fed up with the lot of ye.

22:03.400 --> 22:03.690
I can have you arrested for
drinking in public.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.650
Tell you what.
Why don't you arrest me after

22:06.700 --> 22:09.950
I kick the arse of the guy
who lost my son's case!

22:10.410 --> 22:11.280
Arrgh!

22:11.950 --> 22:13.450
Hey, hey hey.

22:13.490 --> 22:16.160
[Walter] Watch the tie!
It's an expensive tie!

22:16.620 --> 22:17.500
Arrrgh!

22:30.800 --> 22:31.470
That is some ride.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.350
And on a cop's salary, no less.

22:34.390 --> 22:35.310
What salary?

22:35.350 --> 22:36.890
You fired me, remember?

22:39.900 --> 22:42.020
Nice and easy, Bennett.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.320
How about we do this-

22:43.940 --> 22:45.110
without these?

23:00.120 --> 23:01.750
Now explain to me why I'm not

23:01.790 --> 23:03.960
bringing you in
this very second?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.380
I'm betting you wanna hear
what I have to say first.

23:06.420 --> 23:07.800
That seem like quite a gamble.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.590
It's the only card I have left.

23:10.550 --> 23:11.850
Alright. I'm listening.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.150
Hey.
Where's Des?

23:24.730 --> 23:25.230
Good question.

23:25.980 --> 23:26.280
Did you guys find Poppy?

23:27.440 --> 23:27.780
Oh yes. Thank God.
But I have a feeling

23:29.070 --> 23:30.990
that Rhodes character isn't
done with us yet.

23:32.030 --> 23:32.990
What is it? What's wrong?

23:33.580 --> 23:34.620
I found this-

23:34.660 --> 23:35.950
In Des's jeans.

23:37.370 --> 23:38.410
You don't think?

23:38.450 --> 23:40.920
I don't know. But we can guess.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.580
I thought you just
broke up with him.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.340
I was feeling this was
gonna happen.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.710
And I freaked out.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.880
It's the logical next
step, right?

23:50.630 --> 23:51.720
Is it what you want?

23:52.300 --> 23:55.720
Yes? It is, but-

23:55.760 --> 23:56.100
[Kathleen]
Take it from me.

23:57.430 --> 23:58.890
You don't want to do this,
if you're not sure.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.600
[Rose] Yeah. But you
also don't want to

24:01.640 --> 24:04.860
throw something away because
you're scared of the next step.

24:04.900 --> 24:07.020
- Hmmm.
- Yeah.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.190
- Okay, guys-
- It'll all work itself out.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.780
Trust me.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.420
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.170
It's draughty in here. I didn't
really think this through.

24:27.210 --> 24:29.300
I mean,
I'm basically wearing a dress.

24:29.340 --> 24:31.380
Yeah, well. You got the
legs to pull it off.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.590
That's a kind thing to
say. I needed that.

24:40.220 --> 24:43.350
Because of you- my son's
going to jail for eternity!

24:43.390 --> 24:44.730
Will you knock it off!

24:44.770 --> 24:46.690
Knock it off, the two
of ya. Come on!

24:46.730 --> 24:47.690
Good call.

24:48.270 --> 24:49.400
See ya later.

24:50.530 --> 24:50.740
Are you all right?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.530
What's weird is that I had a
dream that I beat up other guys

24:54.570 --> 24:55.780
the night before it
actually happened.

24:55.820 --> 24:56.410
Yeah.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.790
- Hello?
- You've got minutes.

24:58.830 --> 24:59.120
We gotta hurry.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.410
Hey, did you ever find
any slacks?

25:01.450 --> 25:03.000
Or really long shorts?

25:03.040 --> 25:04.750
Even a pair of socks.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.170
Tell him we need a distraction.

25:06.210 --> 25:07.960
- Jake says-
- I heard him.

25:09.460 --> 25:10.420
Got it.

25:12.630 --> 25:13.880
- Arrrrgh!
- Malachy!

25:15.430 --> 25:17.930
[Walter] You are extremely
drunk! And you're very upset.

25:17.970 --> 25:19.890
And I can tell that. But I
should be drunk with you.

25:19.930 --> 25:20.270
He's my best friend!

25:21.730 --> 25:24.350
The Chevaliers? You think
they've gotten to the cops?

25:24.390 --> 25:26.400
They had City Hall on the take.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.310
It makes sense that they'd
have the cops.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.360
Do you realize what
you're inferring?

25:30.400 --> 25:30.650
I know how this looks.

25:32.110 --> 25:35.320
A cop on the run under suspicion
for a million things.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.200
Accusing other cops of
being dirty.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.580
Yeah, it looks crazy,
is what it looks like.

25:39.620 --> 25:42.040
The RNC is an extremely
reputable force.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.160
I know that.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.790
I spent my life a part of it.

25:44.830 --> 25:46.870
But we need to root out
who's behind all this.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.210
And I need your help.

25:48.380 --> 25:48.670
You know this is ridiculous,
don't you?

25:49.790 --> 25:52.420
Someone is on the take
on the force.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.300
And the thing is-

25:55.220 --> 25:56.800
I know every cop pretty well.

25:58.430 --> 26:00.180
With the exception
of one or two.

26:01.470 --> 26:03.430
One or two.

26:04.430 --> 26:04.940
Meaning me, sergeant?

26:06.060 --> 26:08.350
Now, I'm working
with the Bikers, am I?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.940
I didn't say that.
You did.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.450
I dug through the files.

26:16.490 --> 26:16.780
There's a lot of content here.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.320
There's some pictures
and other garbage.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.830
But there's a series
of hidden files.

26:21.870 --> 26:23.660
We know if Clarke was
blackmailing the Bikers-

26:23.700 --> 26:25.460
Obviously he wanted to keep
whatever information

26:25.500 --> 26:26.160
he had on 'em.

26:27.370 --> 26:27.750
[Clarke] [on phone] Hey, I'm the mayor.

26:28.710 --> 26:28.960
I can do
whatever I want.

26:30.580 --> 26:33.090
Consider the Chevaliers welcome
in the City of Legends. Okay?

26:34.050 --> 26:34.340
[Rhodes] Is that a guarantee?

26:35.550 --> 26:37.090
My organization rewards our
friends.

26:37.130 --> 26:37.470
I can guarantee you that.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.300
[Pickard] And I can
confirm Mr. Rhodes statement.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.010
Stop, stop, stop.
Play that back.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.100
[Pickard] And I can
confirm Mr. Rhodes statement.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.440
That voice sound familiar?

26:48.480 --> 26:48.810
Pickard.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.020
He's with Leslie right now.

26:56.030 --> 26:57.530
Is there something you wanna
share with me?

26:57.570 --> 26:59.450
Why would I wanna share
anything-

26:59.490 --> 27:01.030
with a disgraced cop

27:01.070 --> 27:02.530
- who's wanted by the law.
- [message sound]

27:09.710 --> 27:10.580
[whack]

27:19.510 --> 27:20.470
[bang]

27:20.510 --> 27:21.550
[bang]

27:21.590 --> 27:22.640
[bang]

27:22.680 --> 27:23.560
Damn!

27:33.980 --> 27:34.860
[bang]

27:46.370 --> 27:47.000
It's a shame.

27:47.910 --> 27:49.250
You shoulda said you were sorry.

27:49.870 --> 27:51.370
Just walked away.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.210
It all would have been
so much easier.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.130
Arrrgh!

28:07.470 --> 28:08.350
[bang]

28:20.780 --> 28:21.650
[Jake]
Leslie!

28:23.410 --> 28:24.280
It's her car.

28:25.450 --> 28:26.870
Leslie's phone.

28:29.870 --> 28:31.330
Pickard's got his gun.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.130
Leslie doesn't have hers.

28:39.130 --> 28:40.010
Dad.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.680
Leslie!

29:00.900 --> 29:01.900
Dad.

29:01.940 --> 29:02.820
Pickard.

29:04.950 --> 29:05.820
Leslie!

29:06.490 --> 29:07.370
He's dead.

29:17.460 --> 29:18.340
Okay, baby.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.760
Oh you're okay, baby.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.420
We gotta get her
out of here.

29:27.470 --> 29:28.800
Nikki!
Nikki!

29:28.850 --> 29:29.510
What happened?

29:30.260 --> 29:31.970
Shit! Put her up here!

29:32.020 --> 29:33.020
What happened?

29:33.060 --> 29:33.600
She's been shot.

29:34.310 --> 29:35.480
And she's pregnant.

29:41.610 --> 29:41.940
What?

29:43.440 --> 29:45.740
She told me. She begged me to
let her tell you herself.

29:46.280 --> 29:46.910
She's what?

29:48.490 --> 29:51.200
Okay. I need an ambulance at
fourteen Cochrane Street now.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.450
Officer down. I need
immediate assistance.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.660
No, no, no. Nikki, what?

29:56.170 --> 29:58.710
Go. Jake you have to get out of
here. You have to go.

29:58.750 --> 29:59.750
Son. We gotta go.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.550
You need to go!

30:03.800 --> 30:04.010
Get out.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.340
I will take care of her.
I will take care of her.

30:07.380 --> 30:08.760
Jake, I've got it.
I've got it.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.140
Take him, Mal.
Take him.

30:10.180 --> 30:11.470
You guys have to get
out. Get out!

30:14.100 --> 30:15.430
I've got it.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.520
I've got her. I
got her. I got her.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.440
I've got her.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.200
She's gonna be okay.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.910
Are you sure? Are
you sure about that?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.660
Son I know this isn't how you
wanted things to go.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.250
It isn't how any of us
wanted this to go.

30:36.290 --> 30:37.750
But we have to stay positive.

30:37.790 --> 30:38.290
Stay strong.

30:39.040 --> 30:39.960
What a load of bullshit.

30:40.710 --> 30:42.380
She's pregnant. She's-

30:43.590 --> 30:44.130
You shoulda told me.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.340
You should have told me!

30:48.760 --> 30:49.760
Sorry.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.680
No, Dad. I'm sorry.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.810
It's okay.

30:53.850 --> 30:55.930
Jacob, we'll do this. Okay?

30:55.980 --> 30:57.270
We'll get through this.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.020
Arrrgh!

31:09.240 --> 31:10.950
She is going to be okay.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.990
We gotta find Rhodes.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.830
Looks like he's found us.

31:27.590 --> 31:28.970
[Rose] Please tell us
you're all right.

31:29.010 --> 31:29.300
Don't talk. Just listen.

31:30.590 --> 31:33.470
Leslie. She's in the hospital.
I need you to

31:33.510 --> 31:34.930
go there and look after her.

31:34.970 --> 31:35.310
I will. Jake.

31:36.520 --> 31:36.810
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

31:38.020 --> 31:39.810
[Jake] Don't worry
about us. Just please-

31:39.850 --> 31:41.350
Promise me you'll
look after Leslie.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.270
Des, get Clarke's
phone to the cops.

31:43.310 --> 31:44.230
What about you guys?

31:44.270 --> 31:45.190
Malachy, are you okay?

31:45.230 --> 31:46.230
Love you Rose.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.190
Love all of you.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.070
We both do.

31:52.950 --> 31:53.990
[bangs]

32:03.500 --> 32:04.840
That wasn't very nice.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.380
Sir.

32:07.210 --> 32:08.460
Respectful enough for you?

32:09.340 --> 32:09.840
Not like I had much choice.

32:11.050 --> 32:12.680
We have unfinished business-
You and me.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.010
I don't suppose
that would involve you

32:14.600 --> 32:16.970
giving me the footage that'll
prove my innocence. Does it?

32:17.010 --> 32:18.350
The only thing you'll
be getting from me

32:18.390 --> 32:20.020
is a quick and painless death.

32:20.770 --> 32:21.020
Yeah. I'm pretty sure

32:22.270 --> 32:22.480
we're gonna have
something to say about that.

32:23.810 --> 32:25.270
[Rodney] We can make it
painful, if you want.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.650
It's all the same to us.

32:26.690 --> 32:27.820
[Rhodes]
Trust me.

32:27.860 --> 32:29.400
You're gonna die today.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.280
And it's better that you forget
about that idea-

32:31.320 --> 32:32.990
of clearing your name.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.830
Is that the only copy?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.250
What an asshole, you are.

32:48.170 --> 32:48.960
I made you an offer, Jake.

32:50.210 --> 32:51.720
Even when you were messing
with my business-

32:51.760 --> 32:54.090
And what did you do?
You spit in my eye.

32:54.130 --> 32:56.890
And now.
We gotta kill you.

32:56.930 --> 32:58.060
And your whole family.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.010
[sirens]

32:59.060 --> 32:59.270
Better make a move.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.230
Cops will be here any second.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
What charge?

33:04.440 --> 33:04.690
Obstruction of traffic?

33:06.270 --> 33:08.900
No, Mr. and Mr. Doyle. I believe
they're after the fugitive-

33:08.940 --> 33:09.820
from justice.

33:15.820 --> 33:16.160
Damon Rhodes!

33:17.410 --> 33:18.660
Get down on your knees
with your hands up.

33:28.670 --> 33:29.670
[bang]

33:29.710 --> 33:32.170
[gunfire]

33:32.210 --> 33:33.260
[machine gun fire]

33:33.300 --> 33:34.050
[bang]

33:34.510 --> 33:36.340
[gunfire]

33:39.180 --> 33:40.470
I'm going after Rhodes!

33:42.350 --> 33:43.390
Hold your fire.

33:44.020 --> 33:44.940
Alisha?

33:44.980 --> 33:45.900
Drop your weapons.

33:45.940 --> 33:46.810
You're surrounded.

33:49.980 --> 33:52.030
Malachy Doyle.
Stop right there!

34:11.380 --> 34:12.210
[punch]

34:12.590 --> 34:13.300
Ow!

34:14.510 --> 34:17.840
I need the other copies of
that footage.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.800
Got 'em right here.

34:19.850 --> 34:20.720
Ahhh!

34:23.600 --> 34:24.430
Argh!

34:25.310 --> 34:26.230
Ugh!

34:26.270 --> 34:27.310
Oh!

34:33.070 --> 34:34.900
I'm glad I gave you
that little nick.

34:34.940 --> 34:35.990
Like I said-

34:36.030 --> 34:37.660
This one's gonna go much deeper.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.570
[bang]

34:42.740 --> 34:45.660
Jake. Meet Federal
Officer Alisha Myles.

34:45.700 --> 34:46.040
Hi there.

34:46.830 --> 34:47.670
You just saved my life.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.170
Do we have enough history now?

34:50.210 --> 34:51.170
Yeah.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.050
Good.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.090
I need to bring you in.

34:55.130 --> 34:56.800
No, no, no, no. You can't.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.090
I gotta get to the hospital
to see Leslie. Please.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.140
I'm sorry.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.890
Jake Doyle, you're under arrest.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.650
Hello!

35:14.820 --> 35:17.740
Can someone please tell
me if Leslie's okay?

35:20.490 --> 35:21.370
I can't believe you're a cop.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.200
Vic Saul said he raised you.

35:24.240 --> 35:24.740
He didn't.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.120
My uncle used to work for Saul.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.620
Before he got him killed.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.870
And I swore when
I was old enough,

35:29.920 --> 35:31.080
I'd do something about it.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.170
So I became a cop.

35:33.090 --> 35:33.340
Then Rhodes came on the scene

35:34.460 --> 35:35.920
and I had chance
to take 'em all down.

35:35.960 --> 35:36.260
Great work. But why
didn't you tell us?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.430
I was working undercover and
being watched like a hawk.

35:39.470 --> 35:39.760
I couldn't trust anyone.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.180
Look. We know there's
another copy of this video.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.520
Just search Rhodes's place.
Please.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.390
We're on it.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.310
But, just so you know -

35:50.350 --> 35:51.810
It's a long shot, at best.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.150
Come on. Let's go.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.530
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:05.620 --> 36:07.450
- I think we need to talk.
- Yeah.

36:07.490 --> 36:11.250
I'm sorry about earlier.
But Jake needed me. And-

36:11.870 --> 36:12.040
I regret nothing.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.540
Except the consequences
for my actions.

36:14.590 --> 36:17.130
No. Des. I found this.

36:17.170 --> 36:17.880
Oh, great. I thought
I lost that.

36:19.170 --> 36:22.800
I was really surprised at first.
Like, shocked.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.010
Yeah, This baby's going
right on E-Bay.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.390
I could use the money.

36:25.430 --> 36:26.970
- What?
- Oh, Finn-

36:27.560 --> 36:29.220
He gave it to me

36:29.270 --> 36:30.640
in lieu of payment
for some work I did for him.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.850
I was gonna surprise Malachy.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.270
Oh.

36:35.980 --> 36:36.320
I'm an idiot.

36:37.650 --> 36:39.940
Wait. Did you-? You
didn't think I was gonna -

36:40.950 --> 36:42.700
propose to you?
Did you? Like-

36:43.240 --> 36:44.570
Me and you -

36:44.620 --> 36:45.780
In marriage?

36:45.820 --> 36:46.580
No.
Des. That'd be stupid.

36:47.740 --> 36:50.000
Because you broke up
with me. Remember?

36:50.040 --> 36:50.500
Yeah.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.750
- I'm really confused.
- I know that.

36:54.830 --> 36:56.920
I don't want you to
propose to me.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.050
What are you doing to my head?

36:59.670 --> 37:01.260
You know I can't read more than
one layer of subtext at a time.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.220
- Forget it. I gotta go.
- No, no!

37:05.340 --> 37:09.720
I would cut off all my limbs if
it meant I could be with you.

37:10.430 --> 37:11.930
That's really weird.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.850
I won't. I just-

37:15.020 --> 37:16.940
Maybe this is how
we're supposed to end.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.650
I mean- if we're
meant to be together.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
Then - we'll know.

37:23.490 --> 37:28.910
But right
now, I just don't know anything.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.370
I'm sorry.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.610
[crash]

38:04.450 --> 38:05.610
Over here.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.040
Officer Myles. Where did you
find this material?

38:21.090 --> 38:22.670
When I apprehended Damon Rhodes

38:22.710 --> 38:24.710
for a number of
unrelated charges.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.130
We received a warrant to search
his premises. I found it there.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.930
Not to mention
Judge Tizzard here-

38:28.970 --> 38:30.390
Who's on the take from
the Bikers.

38:30.430 --> 38:32.600
This is all just one big
misunderstanding.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.060
I'd like to say I'm not
enjoying this. But I am.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.600
Unfortunately, Inspector Pickard
was also working for Rhodes.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.730
The Doyles helped me
uncover key evidence.

38:41.570 --> 38:41.770
What about Jake?

38:43.360 --> 38:44.780
The parties are gonna need some
time to sort through this.

38:44.820 --> 38:45.900
Jake's gonna have to be patient.

38:45.940 --> 38:46.280
Due diligence has to be done.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.830
Alison, please. Jake needs to
be with Leslie now.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.330
He's gonna be a dad.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.510
- Leslie.
- Jake.

39:15.470 --> 39:17.810
I dunno what I would've done if
anything had happened to you.

39:18.270 --> 39:19.440
I'm okay.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.820
What about our baby?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.610
Can I see you for a sec?

39:30.990 --> 39:31.570
What is it?

39:32.620 --> 39:33.910
The doctor wanted to
talk to you.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.160
- Is it about the baby?
- I don't know, honey.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.580
He wouldn't tell me.

39:38.620 --> 39:39.750
Is everything okay?

40:08.650 --> 40:11.820
Oh, at least that one looks
more like you than Jake.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.200
And this one too.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.740
We'll see how this
one turns out.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.990
Oh, it's gonna be beautiful.
Trust me.

40:17.030 --> 40:19.160
I just wish you could've seen
the look on Jake's face

40:19.200 --> 40:21.000
when the doctor told him
we were having twins.

40:21.040 --> 40:21.790
Malachy fell off his chair.

40:23.420 --> 40:26.590
Okay. I think it's about time we
got this thing going, don't you?

40:26.630 --> 40:27.550
Yeah.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.590
You clean up good.

40:29.630 --> 40:29.920
Thanks.

40:31.380 --> 40:32.880
Thanks. I shaved my legs.
Was I supposed to do that?

40:32.930 --> 40:34.930
It feels weird.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.220
It's too bad Dad's not gonna be
standing up there with us.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.350
Yeah, I know. It
breaks my heart.

40:42.890 --> 40:43.230
Oh hey. You're up.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.150
Look. I'm really sorry that
I dropped a podium on you

40:46.190 --> 40:48.400
at rehearsal last night.
And then stepped on you.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.110
And then fell on you. And then-

40:50.780 --> 40:51.030
Ripped your pants.

40:52.650 --> 40:56.070
Des. We'll discuss this later
after the pain killers wear off.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.580
Now.
Let's get this show on the road.

40:58.620 --> 40:59.500
Okay.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.210
- Breathe Des. Breathe.
- Okay.

41:20.470 --> 41:20.810
Oooh!

41:22.100 --> 41:24.060
I'm so happy. I'm so happy,
I forgot my line.

41:25.230 --> 41:27.440
- All you gotta say is "I do."
- I do.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.020
- Not to me. To her.
- Okay.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.320
- Now get over here.
- Okay.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.560
- Go get her.
- Okay.

42:17.610 --> 42:19.280
You can kiss her
before if you want.

42:19.320 --> 42:20.200
Yeah?

42:23.620 --> 42:24.870
Turned out pretty good.

42:25.710 --> 42:25.870
Easy for you to say.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.500
They're moving in with me until
they can afford a house.

42:29.540 --> 42:32.380
Now I gotta double his salary to
get them out faster.

42:34.090 --> 42:35.720
You're contempt for other people

42:35.760 --> 42:37.840
can only be trumped by your
tightness of the dollar.

42:37.890 --> 42:38.800
Amazing.

42:40.930 --> 42:42.010
[Mal] So Son...

42:44.220 --> 42:45.430
Are you happy?

42:48.980 --> 42:53.440
Honestly? I wish this
moment would never end.
