<i>PHOENIX,ARIZONA</i>

00:06.660 --> 00:08.510
He's too damn old.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.670
Overweight, overpriced.

00:10.690 --> 00:11.910
Too damn old.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.650
What, so you're saying they
should have kept marion?

00:13.660 --> 00:15.620
That's exactly what i'm saying.

00:15.630 --> 00:18.310
Marion, nash, stoudemire.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.660
Well, that's a team.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.880
Yeah, same team that couldn't
even make it past the first round.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.140
What is it?

00:30.150 --> 00:31.680
- Where are we?
- What?

00:31.690 --> 00:33.730
I'm asking you, where are we?

00:33.740 --> 00:37.580
I don't know. Sixth and... Buckeye?

00:39.930 --> 00:42.910
Wrong. We were on sixth 8 bloc ago.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.770
Well, so what? What
are we doing back here?

00:44.780 --> 00:46.570
We're learning.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.030
Now, where are we?

00:52.170 --> 00:53.680
I don't know.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.160
You've got to know.

00:55.170 --> 00:57.510
You always, always have
got to know where you are.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.790
I mean, let's just say you jumput
of the car and run after some maggot.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.970
This thing can't help you.

01:00.980 --> 01:03.780
Back-up will wind up at
the car 5 blocks away.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.760
Won't do you much good, now will it?

01:05.770 --> 01:06.810
No, sir.

01:06.820 --> 01:09.650
Don't sir me. Sir's for the academy.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.300
I'm your partner.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.930
Yes, sir--uh,
right.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.950
Four-fifteen frank, 4129 23rd avenue.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.510
Repeat, four-fifteen frank
in progress at 4129 23rd.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.220
That's domestic violence.
Tell them we're on it.

01:23.230 --> 01:25.930
Uh, copy that.

01:44.450 --> 01:47.170
Are you kidding me? Hurry up!

02:01.760 --> 02:03.430
Hold it!

02:03.440 --> 02:06.970
Oh, my god! Officer down, officer down!

02:08.030 --> 02:09.720
Copy that, officer. What's your 20?

02:09.729 --> 02:12.380
We're at 23rd street!

02:12.390 --> 02:14.320
Officer?

02:14.330 --> 02:17.980
Back-up is on
the way.907--

02:17.990 --> 02:20.120
all units, 4129 23rd avenue...

02:20.140 --> 02:24.160
Earlier this evening, the phoenix
police force lost two of our own.

02:24.180 --> 02:30.150
Sergeant manuel rodriguez and officer thomas
kayser were killed in the line of duty.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.020
That's 3 officers in the past 4 days.

02:34.050 --> 02:37.950
After the first shooting, the phoenix
police department assumed gang involvement.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.450
Pretty reasonable assumption.

02:39.480 --> 02:43.050
True. Almost 30% of all officer
slayings are gang related.

02:43.060 --> 02:44.950
Technically it's closer to 40%.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.750
If a cop isn't killed during a commission of
a crime, gang involvement is highly likely.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.660
Actually, their precinct commander believes
it may be a serial and has asked for our help.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.210
What makes him doubt the gang theory?

02:54.220 --> 02:55.260
A couple of things.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.420
Last night's victims were killed
exactly the same way as the first.

02:58.430 --> 02:59.370
Shot in the neck.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.020
Something that the press didn't release.

03:01.030 --> 03:03.270
Well, now, wait. There could
still be a gang behind this.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.100
Killers working together
could establish the same M.O.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.160
Commander Marks hasn't ruled it
out, but there's another detail--

03:09.170 --> 03:12.330
Trophies. Killer took their badges.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.420
Gang members don't
usually take trophies.

03:14.430 --> 03:16.040
They don't need to.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.770
This is an unsub with something to pre.

03:17.790 --> 03:20.010
And he's got the entire city on edge.

03:20.020 --> 03:23.410
Kill those who protect and
serve, and no one feels safe.

04:23.670 --> 04:27.000
and i for one would be willing
to skin humanity to prove it."

04:27.020 --> 04:29.010
Ayn rand.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.390
Go ahead, Garcia.

04:31.420 --> 04:35.880
Ok, while you birds have been in the
air, i got the 411 on the first shooting.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.800
Apparently every saturday night,
phoenix p.d.sets up a dui checkpoint.

04:39.820 --> 04:40.900
Is that common knowledge?

04:40.910 --> 04:43.100
Mais, oui. Public awareness
is part of the deterrent.

04:43.110 --> 04:47.280
So our unsub blows past
said checkpoint at 90 mph,

04:47.300 --> 04:51.370
And is pursued by a
officer jason kessinger.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.640
Kessinger pulls the car over,
approaches the driver's side window,

04:54.650 --> 04:57.530
Where he is shot in the throat.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.520
Mon dieu.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.060
He was a single parent, 2 daughters.

05:03.080 --> 05:07.150
So, the unsub planned ahead,
used the dui stop to set his trap,

05:07.180 --> 05:09.170
And then lured the officer to his death.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.360
It could have been personal.

05:10.370 --> 05:13.350
The unsub might have had a problem
with these particular officers.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.780
Or with law enforcement in
general. He's sending a message.

05:15.790 --> 05:20.610
Criminals, gang members, academy washouts, security
rent a cops, teenagers, and that's just a start.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.520
I mean, the list of people who have a
problem with police officers is a long one.

05:24.530 --> 05:27.350
The victims were shot in the neck, so the
unsub knew they'd be wearing body armor.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.990
And he used a dui checkpoint.

05:29.010 --> 05:32.340
I mean, both incidents show an active
understanding of police procedure.

05:32.350 --> 05:34.950
Which narrows it down to
anybody who watches television.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.460
We need to cover victimology.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.290
Garcia, find out everything you
can about the officers killed.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.860
See what they had in common
besides their uniforms.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.050
Will do, but i should warn
you, it will not be cake

05:44.060 --> 05:46.240
Because i have been on the phone
with these guys all morning,

05:46.250 --> 05:49.260
And pulling files from them
has been like pulling molars.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.120
Is there a problem?

05:50.130 --> 05:52.990
You know, aside from the obvious
grief for their fallen comdres,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.790
And their fear of being
used as target practice,

05:54.810 --> 05:57.420
I get the distinct impression
from their crabby behavior,

05:57.450 --> 06:01.950
They are none too pleased their boss is
outsourcing this investigation to the fbi, so...

06:01.970 --> 06:05.160
Be prepared to hit a
blue wall of resistance.

06:10.410 --> 06:13.110
Commander Marks, i'm ssa
Hotchner. This is agent Todd.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.350
Agents Rossi, Prentiss,
Morgan, and dr. Spencer Reid.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.240
- Thank you for inviting us.
- And thank you all for coming.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.440
Although i'd like to have
a word if you don't mind.

06:20.450 --> 06:21.730
Of course. Excuse me.

06:21.740 --> 06:23.770
Uh, lieutenant evans.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.510
Lieutenant evans will answer any
questions the rest of you may have.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.320
I'll call you later. This way.

06:30.670 --> 06:33.250
Sorry, that was officer kayser's wife.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.440
They'd only been married
a couple of months.

06:35.460 --> 06:39.380
She seems to think that the
fbi is here to save the day.

06:39.810 --> 06:42.650
Is that what you're going to do, agents?

06:46.120 --> 06:47.680
I apologize.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.550
It turns out i may
have wasted your time.

06:50.560 --> 06:54.040
Ballistics came back. Both
.357 magnums, but not a match.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.500
Looks like we're talking about
2 different shooters after all.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.210
- We don't think so.
- Really?

06:58.220 --> 07:01.530
Well, everyone he is pretty convinced
this is the beginning of a gang war.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.580
No, i understand that
you could see it that way,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.960
But we believe that the shootings
are indicative of a single killer,

07:05.970 --> 07:07.430
One who's not a gang member.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.070
You're saying one
shooter, multiple weapons.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.430
That's the theory.

07:11.450 --> 07:16.000
Both attacks were detailed, well planned
out traps, not typical for a gang hit.

07:16.010 --> 07:18.570
And the trophy taking suggests
serial pathology, as well.

07:18.580 --> 07:22.190
All right, look, i know i called you
guys in, but i am way out on a limb here.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.260
My officerfeel like it's a betrayal, like i
don't trust them to find this son of a bitch.

07:26.270 --> 07:29.140
I gotta get this settled fast before
this whole department comes unglued.

07:29.150 --> 07:30.300
Look, i get it.

07:30.310 --> 07:32.640
We're only here to help and
not hijack the investigation.

07:32.650 --> 07:37.360
But if our theory is correct, the unsub's
already looking for another excuse to kill again.

07:39.010 --> 07:41.250
See, this is twelve's territory.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.230
- And you think they're behind this?
- Does it matter?

07:43.240 --> 07:45.180
Yes, it matters to us, lieutenant.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.260
You know this city and its
gangs better than we do.

07:47.270 --> 07:49.680
We'd like to hear your theories.

07:49.690 --> 07:51.600
Ok, twelves has a captain.

07:51.630 --> 07:54.790
Street name playboy.
Vice broke up a drug ring.

07:54.800 --> 07:59.020
Shot his brother, d.o.a.playboy
thought he would kill us all.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.970
Well, it is pretty strong motivation, but your
commander said the dash cam only showed one attacker.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.410
Most 'bangers will bring
some back-up just in case.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.270
Well, playboy runs the
toughest crew in town.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.940
He's not "most 'bangers."

08:08.950 --> 08:11.270
Well, you said the dash cam
only showed one attacker.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.550
Why show your face at all?

08:12.560 --> 08:13.610
Because he had to.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.350
He wanted to take them both out at
the house, but they broke protocol.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.700
Rodriguez approached
the house by himself.

08:17.710 --> 08:20.400
Wait a minute. Are you
telling me they screwed up?

08:20.410 --> 08:24.560
No, lieutenant, i'm saying that they split up,
forcing the unsub to take them out separately,

08:24.580 --> 08:26.280
One here at the house
and one at the car.

08:26.290 --> 08:27.700
That front unit's empty.

08:27.710 --> 08:29.920
He could have set himself
up there and waited.

08:29.930 --> 08:32.539
The element of surprise was on his side.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.289
Choice of neighborhood was deliberate.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.789
Neighbors around here are
used to hearing gunfire.

08:36.799 --> 08:40.429
They'll blame it on the
gangs, and so will the police.

08:44.430 --> 08:46.480
Techs have gone over
this frame by frame.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.680
There's no way to identify the shooter.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.070
Approximate height and weight,
that's about all we got.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.670
The unsub's face isn't the
only way to identify him.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.490
We also look at specific
behavioral traits.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.510
These are the reasons you
don't believe it's a gang?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.430
The shooter established
what we call a signature,

09:00.440 --> 09:03.410
Something he did during the murders
that wasn't actually necessary.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.380
Not part of his M.O., but
identical in every attack.

09:06.390 --> 09:08.530
In this case, the unsub
took the officer's badges.

09:08.550 --> 09:11.420
He's symbolically stripping them
of their power and authority.

09:11.430 --> 09:15.030
This act is indicative of someone
who is looking to gain self-esteem.

09:15.050 --> 09:18.340
Gang members and other assailants who
work together kill for different reasons,

09:18.360 --> 09:22.380
But usually it's not to gain
confidence, 'cause they already have it.

09:23.050 --> 09:25.250
Hotch, you see that? Can we pause this?

09:25.260 --> 09:28.300
Ok, now zoom in and press play.

09:28.310 --> 09:31.610
Taking the badge would
have taken a few seconds.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.560
- He's lingering.
- Doing what?

09:35.570 --> 09:38.090
That's a good question.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.930
At least now, everyone with
force knows he's out there.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.140
It'll be harder for him to
lure someone into his trap.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.650
Well, not necessarily.

09:44.660 --> 09:49.240
Being a cop is always dangerous, but even with the
extra back-up and rover cars added to the shifts,

09:49.260 --> 09:51.530
Phoenix p.d.'s still going
to have to do their job.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.170
Which means walking into a potential
ambush every time they take a call.

09:54.190 --> 09:57.440
245 in progress, 106 east broadway road.

09:57.470 --> 10:00.530
Repeat, 245, report of
an aggravated assault.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.980
Copy that.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.270
Behind the car.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.780
Oh, yeah.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.330
- Looks like a couple of bums.
- Yep.

10:29.340 --> 10:32.000
Hey, police!

10:32.010 --> 10:34.300
Clear out of here!

10:50.450 --> 10:52.590
I got it!

11:16.680 --> 11:18.890
Son of a bitch!

11:19.990 --> 11:22.290
Mark!

11:24.000 --> 11:26.320
Mark!

11:29.300 --> 11:30.960
Mark!

11:30.970 --> 11:33.530
Officer down, 106 east broadway road.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.250
Copy that, officer,
calling for back-up.

11:36.260 --> 11:42.450
1099, code 2. Repeat, 1099,
code 2, 106 east broadway road.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.770
Mark!

11:50.420 --> 11:52.030
Car 5-1, back-up
is on the way.

11:52.050 --> 11:55.280
Car 5-1, i repeat,
back-up is on the way.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.680
Thank you.

12:51.550 --> 12:52.830
He set us up.

12:52.850 --> 12:55.790
We knew he was out there, he
still managed to set us up.

12:55.810 --> 12:57.220
I'm sorry.

12:57.230 --> 13:01.780
I watched my partner die, and i
couldn't do anything to save him.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.810
Don't worry, ron.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.690
Playboy's going to pay for this.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.840
Yosaw playboy there?

13:08.850 --> 13:11.400
- No, but-- - we all
know he did it, agent.

13:11.410 --> 13:13.550
No, we don't.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.150
Lieutenant, you think i don't
know how bad you want this guy?

13:17.160 --> 13:18.640
I was a uniform just like you.

13:18.650 --> 13:20.630
I saw a lot of cops go down.

13:20.650 --> 13:23.630
Before that, i watched
my father get shot.

13:23.660 --> 13:28.690
He was killed doing his job, a cop's
job, so don't think i don't know.

13:29.780 --> 13:34.240
Officer Mercer, what happened
when you got the call?

13:34.840 --> 13:36.830
Nothing special.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.580
Report of an aggravated assault.

13:39.590 --> 13:41.040
We were on it.

13:41.050 --> 13:43.180
This your regular beat?

13:43.200 --> 13:46.930
We were additional tonight,
added because of the shootings.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.570
Did you get a look at the guy?

13:52.580 --> 13:57.720
Nothing. I was too damn
scared. I'm still scared.

13:59.050 --> 14:01.880
You're not the only one.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.640
My partner's family.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.330
What am i going to tell them?

14:14.340 --> 14:19.100
The only thing you can tell them-- that
we're going to catch the guy who did this.

14:19.830 --> 14:22.740
But the right guy.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.080
Anything?

14:34.110 --> 14:35.800
We can forget cross referencing.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.880
These guys were just assigned this beat.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.040
There's no way the unsub could
have known they'd get the call.

14:40.050 --> 14:42.240
He's using the 9-1-1
calls like a lottery.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.590
He's picking cops at random.

14:43.610 --> 14:46.500
And yet there's nothing
random about the shootings.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.270
Each scenario has been
increasingly complex.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.880
He's enjoying the hunt.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.970
Taking the time to set his victims
up and luring them into his net.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.030
It's become as important
to him as the kill itself.

14:56.060 --> 15:00.790
And this last one he executed while the
fbi and every cop in the city was after him.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.590
And the press... Their
attention's feeding him.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.210
Playing right into the
unsub's need to feel superior.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.370
The press is not our on problem.

15:12.860 --> 15:16.050
These guys are still trying to pin the
shootings on a gangbanger named playboy.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.870
I have a feeling we're not going to
be able to hold them off much longer.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.180
Hello, playboy.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.060
What the hell, man?

15:30.070 --> 15:32.480
Let's go spend some
quality time together.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.980
Time for what?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.120
- Whatever you got, i didn't do it.
- Yeah.

15:40.950 --> 15:44.300
Lighten up, man. I'm
telling you, i didn't do it.

15:44.310 --> 15:48.440
Yeah? Well, i got a magic eight
ball that says you did, playboy.

15:48.450 --> 15:50.890
Commander, what's going on?

15:50.900 --> 15:54.460
What's going on is my officers are being shot
in the streets and crucified by the press.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.320
That's what's going on.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.700
So you've arrested the wrong person?

15:56.710 --> 15:59.600
I brought in a viable
subjt for questioning.

15:59.620 --> 16:02.100
I had to do something.

16:02.110 --> 16:05.060
I didn't kill no cop. Period.

16:05.780 --> 16:08.290
Sure, playboy.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.800
Just cross your heart, and we're done.

16:09.810 --> 16:11.440
Commder, i understand
the pressure you're under,

16:11.460 --> 16:13.700
But doing this could
undermine the investigation.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.470
Bringing in another suspect draws
attention away from the real unsub.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.700
If he starts to feel inadequate, he
may strike sooner just to prove himself.

16:19.730 --> 16:23.750
It's also possible accusing one of their
members could antagonize local gangs,

16:23.780 --> 16:26.560
Which is the last thing your officers
need to be worrying about right now.

16:26.580 --> 16:29.950
All right, look. I told you guys i was out on
a limb here, so unless you have a suspect...

16:29.960 --> 16:31.350
Hotch.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.640
Since we've got this guy, why
don't we see if we can use him?

16:34.650 --> 16:36.470
You mind if talk to him?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.680
Be my guest.

16:39.710 --> 16:42.170
Commander, i appreciate your letting
agent Morgan join the interrogation,

16:42.180 --> 16:44.170
But i promise you,
this is not our unsub.

16:44.180 --> 16:47.050
The real killer's still out there.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.350
I know you didn't do it, playboy.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.240
So why you dragging
my ass in here, then?

16:57.250 --> 17:00.880
I said i know you didn't kill
those cops, but he doesn't.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.870
And they don't. And trust
me, they don't care, man.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.829
But you do. Oh, you care about me.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.480
I don't give a damn about you.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.990
Tell you what i do care about.

17:16.010 --> 17:17.369
Catching the killer.

17:17.390 --> 17:18.579
I told you, i didn'do it.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.190
But i think you know who did.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.550
No way, man. It wasn't one of us.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.740
OK.I'll give you that.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.369
Whoever did do this ain't no 'banger.

17:28.390 --> 17:31.120
But he's been working your
hood pretty tough, though, huh?

17:31.140 --> 17:33.650
Without your say.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.430
He's making you look
real suspect, playboy.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.860
Causing you nothing but trouble.

17:39.870 --> 17:42.300
He won't last long, then.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.180
Come on, man, look around you.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.260
From where i'm sitting, it looks
like he's doing all right so far.

17:47.270 --> 17:51.070
I mean, if i'm you, i'm thinking i want
this guy gone for good. What you think?

17:51.620 --> 17:54.110
Yeah.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.080
You know so much. Who is he?

17:59.200 --> 18:01.610
Probably somebody you'd least suspect.

18:01.620 --> 18:05.560
Probably wouldn't even think twice about him
'cause he really don't look all that dangerous.

18:05.570 --> 18:08.150
Well, at least not on the surface.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.930
But he gets real violent.

18:09.950 --> 18:12.950
- Well, we all violent.
- No, no, no, not like this, man.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.840
This cat goes from cold to hot in
a heartbeat, nothing in between.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.310
Takes everything real personal.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.420
Thinks everybody's trying to put him
down, so he's always looking for a fight,

18:21.450 --> 18:23.600
Even if he knows he's going to lose.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.810
- So he's stupid.
- Maybe.

18:25.820 --> 18:29.240
But he's aggressive. Think, man.

18:29.250 --> 18:33.000
You give me something, maybe
i get you out of all of this.

18:33.010 --> 18:36.530
He's white. He's older
than you, not by much.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.670
And he works alone.

18:38.680 --> 18:42.120
You know somebody like
this, i know you do.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.470
There was this guy...

18:49.490 --> 18:51.770
He was white.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.610
He killed me lieutenant
a couple of months ago.

18:55.620 --> 18:58.040
- Bobby q.
- Yeah.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.000
He was like my brother.

18:59.010 --> 19:01.150
Yeah, your brother was
a junkie, so was bobby q.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.010
I see the similarity.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.640
Sit down, sit down!

19:06.650 --> 19:09.410
Don't even think about it. Talk to me.

19:09.880 --> 19:13.490
Forget him. I'm helping you, he's not.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.440
All right. Your lieutenant, bobby q.

19:22.810 --> 19:24.520
What happened?

19:24.540 --> 19:27.740
Well, i told the cops it wasn't a
gang thing. They didn't believe me.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.220
Yeah, that's 'cause you always tell
us the truth, don't you, playboy?

19:30.230 --> 19:31.630
I'm serious, man.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.070
Playboy, don't do it.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.500
So who killed him?

19:39.510 --> 19:42.890
If i knew his name,
he'd be dead already.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.300
There's been another shooting.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.850
- I'll cut him loose.
- No. Not yet.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.380
Hotch, this guy knows something.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.420
All right, keep working on it.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.530
They have the shooter cornered
in an apartment building downtown.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.980
Dave, stay with Morgan, see what this guy
has to offer. Prentiss, you're with me.

20:34.550 --> 20:36.040
- He's in there?
- Yeah, we got him cornered.

20:36.050 --> 20:38.120
Men on both floors and the entrances.

20:38.130 --> 20:40.400
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, a banger called diablo.

20:40.410 --> 20:43.810
He's one of the lindo park
assassins. Daws followed him here.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.350
- He all right?
- He'll live. He's a lucky bastard.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.940
We'd like to talk to
daws, if you don't mind.

20:48.950 --> 20:51.670
All right, ok, stay down.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.570
Sergeant daws.

20:55.590 --> 20:57.770
I'm special agent emily
Prentiss, this is ssa Hotchner.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.400
What happened?

20:59.420 --> 21:00.570
He killed my partner.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.620
We're sorry.

21:02.630 --> 21:04.160
We were stopped at a light.

21:04.170 --> 21:05.870
Bastard came right up to the window.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.670
Shot scotty in the head, then shot me.

21:07.690 --> 21:09.550
- Wait a minute.
- There was no radio call?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.160
No. Came out of nowhere.

21:13.230 --> 21:17.360
Guess he thought he'd bagged us
both. Luckily, a truck came. He ran.

21:17.370 --> 21:19.830
I called it in, managed
to tail him here.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.400
- Ok, thank you, sergeant.
- It doesn't track.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.780
- No, it was a blitz attack.
- Let's go.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.720
Let us go in and try to talk him down.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.950
No, hold on.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.100
What's going on?

21:35.130 --> 21:38.770
I've got movement. Looks like ramey
and wilhelm are inside the apartment.

21:38.780 --> 21:41.090
Attempting to apprehend.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.460
What the hell happened in there?

22:04.470 --> 22:06.300
Daws said it's a blitz
attack. It's a different M.O.

22:06.310 --> 22:08.800
Yeah, and this was
done in broad daylight.

22:08.820 --> 22:11.020
It's not our guy.

22:18.940 --> 22:20.450
Yeah, Morgan, what have you got?

22:20.470 --> 22:23.890
Well, playboy's lieutenant was shot
in the neck with a . 357 magnum.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.210
Could have been our guy.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.840
All right, i want you to stay on it.

22:26.850 --> 22:29.620
- Hotch, what's going on?
- Nothing good.

22:34.310 --> 22:38.330
Garcia, i need you to pull everything you
can on a phoenix gangbanger called diablo.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.410
Muy pronto.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.640
Well, let's close it off here.

22:42.650 --> 22:45.450
Commander, can i speak
to you for a second?

22:46.230 --> 22:49.540
Sorry to see it end this way, losing
another officer, but i'm glad it's over.

22:49.550 --> 22:51.170
Sir, i don't believe that it is.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.420
What are you saying? The guy is dead.

22:52.430 --> 22:55.510
This suspect diablo
doesn't fit the profile.

22:56.310 --> 22:59.980
Are you telling me he didn't
shoot officer daws and his partner?

22:59.990 --> 23:02.960
What i'm saying is, he may not be
responsible for the earlier killings.

23:02.970 --> 23:06.470
- Agent Hotchner!Agent Hotchner!
- Commander, we have to be sure!

23:06.480 --> 23:09.110
I have got the chief, i've
got the press, i've the mayor.

23:09.130 --> 23:11.180
Do you realize the pressure the
department's under right now?

23:11.190 --> 23:13.930
Yes, sir, i do, but it wasn't him.

23:13.940 --> 23:15.490
There was an earlier
murder with the same M.O.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.240
This unsub may have
killed one of the twelves.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.380
And how does that help us?

23:18.390 --> 23:22.380
This unsub thinks of himself as a big game
hunter now, but he didn't start out that way.

23:22.390 --> 23:23.130
Meaning?

23:23.140 --> 23:25.800
He started with a gang
member, and he's evolved.

23:25.810 --> 23:27.270
Give me 24 hours.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.510
They're notonna wait that
long, and neither is the chief.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.040
I'll give you four.

23:36.270 --> 23:38.800
Thanks, man. Great job.

23:42.420 --> 23:45.490
Evans. I need your help.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.720
I'd like you to pull a file
on playboy's lieutenant.

23:48.730 --> 23:51.290
It's over, agent. We got the guy.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.820
No, we didn't.

23:52.830 --> 23:56.050
What, because he turned out
to be a gangbanger after all?

23:56.080 --> 23:59.620
Let it go. You guys made a
mistake. You guys were wrong.

23:59.630 --> 24:02.410
So was i. No harm, no foul.

24:02.420 --> 24:04.640
No offense, lieutenant,
but we're not wrong.

24:04.650 --> 24:07.520
The killer is still out
there, and more cops will die.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.650
You heard what officer Mercer said.

24:09.660 --> 24:11.210
His partner was shot.

24:11.220 --> 24:13.660
He couldn't do anything to save him.

24:13.670 --> 24:17.170
Do you want to feel like that when
another one of your guys does get killed?

24:17.180 --> 24:21.650
Or do you want to know that you did everything
you could to try to keep it from happening again?

24:23.320 --> 24:24.350
Ballistics aren't back yet,

24:24.360 --> 24:29.100
But the preliminary m.e.reports suggest the
weapon used to kill officer beck was not a .357

24:29.120 --> 24:32.000
I spoke to Garcia.Beck arrested
diablo twice on drug charges,

24:32.010 --> 24:33.720
last time sent him away for 10 years.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.850
Diablo was just released
on parole last week.

24:35.880 --> 24:40.460
So diablo went after the cop who put him away
assuming it would be lumped in with the other murders.

24:40.490 --> 24:41.950
The unsub would take the fall.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.320
Hey, it almost worked.

24:43.330 --> 24:45.030
Lieutenant, what did you find?

24:45.040 --> 24:49.560
Well, i pulled up that information
on playboy's lieutenant, bobby q.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.250
There's not much there.

24:52.270 --> 24:56.120
And you're thinking playboy was right, that
we didn't pay enough attention to the case.

24:56.130 --> 24:56.870
Did you?

24:56.880 --> 25:00.190
Look, the majority of homicides
in this city are gang killings.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.680
Most times we spend time and resources following
trails that all lead to the same place anyway.

25:04.690 --> 25:08.010
We just assumed this was just
another one of those trails.

25:08.020 --> 25:10.170
Being in a gang shortens
your life expectancy,

25:10.190 --> 25:12.860
So it's no big surprise when
a gangbanger winds up dead.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.480
Same thing could be
said about being a cop.

25:14.510 --> 25:19.660
The job involves a fair amount of risk, so a
percentage of untimely deaths is practically inevitable.

25:19.690 --> 25:22.340
The M.O.is the same as our unsub's.

25:22.360 --> 25:26.480
Did, um, playboy tell you
if the killer took a trophy?

25:26.490 --> 25:28.240
He said boy q's necklace was missing.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.680
Yeah, that's in the report.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.870
Big chain, solid gold.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.620
Just figured the doer
took it to pawn it.

25:33.630 --> 25:36.770
- Or as a souvenir.
- Fits the signature.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.460
He built up to this. We
need to go further back.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.140
Garcia, can you pull
everything in the phoenix area

25:44.160 --> 25:47.310
That matches the same M.O.as our
unsub, not just police officers.

25:47.330 --> 25:51.830
Ok. So i'm searching homicides in
phoenix in, what, the last 2 months?

25:51.840 --> 25:54.250
- Make it three.
- Got it.

25:54.260 --> 25:58.750
Murders, shootings,
specifically neck wounds.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.630
Oh, i got a guy named robert
quinones, nickname bobby q.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.370
We already have that one. Anything else?

26:03.380 --> 26:04.580
Ah, just one more.

26:04.590 --> 26:08.290
A bouncer at a bar in
downtown phoenix, mickey reese.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.490
Weapon's a .357 magnum. Interesting.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.510
It says here the victim was
wearing a ballistic vest.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.330
Apparently they don't serve shley
temples at this establishment.

26:18.340 --> 26:21.910
If the bouncer was wearing a vest, that
could be how our unsub developed his M.O.

26:21.930 --> 26:25.520
- Send us everything you've got.
- Sure. Done.

26:25.530 --> 26:27.900
All right, we got
gangbangers, bouncers and cops.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.360
All pretty tough targets; victims
capable of defending themselves.

26:31.380 --> 26:35.010
As the unsub's sense of power
escalated, so did his confidence,

26:35.020 --> 26:36.950
Leading to bigger and
more difficult prey.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.930
That makes sense. Risky deaths would
increase the unsub's feeling of superiority.

26:39.940 --> 26:43.490
Same thing with using a . 357 magnum.
It would make him feel powerful.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.070
Cops are at the top of that list.

26:45.090 --> 26:48.420
High profile, always on alert,
and they're gonna make headlines.

26:48.430 --> 26:50.200
Killing a gangbanger isn't easy.

26:50.210 --> 26:52.230
They're always armed, travel in packs.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.630
The bouncer's the earliest.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.850
It was a pretty simple attack,
no carefully thought out plan.

26:56.860 --> 26:58.350
He could have been his first victim.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.150
We need to figure out
where their paths crossed.

27:00.170 --> 27:03.050
Morgan, you, Rossi and the
lieutenant go check out the bar.

27:03.070 --> 27:05.310
We'll keep digging.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.870
Like i told the cop before,
it could have been anyone.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.970
Did reese have any enemies?

27:12.980 --> 27:17.490
That's all he had. Mick was a real
hard ass. Always looking to get into it.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.940
Pissed off someone
pretty much every night.

27:19.950 --> 27:23.020
Looks like he took quite a
beating before he was killed.

27:23.030 --> 27:27.260
Any idea which one of your patrons
might have given him these bruises?

27:27.270 --> 27:28.830
Didn't get those here, man.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.630
De was into some kind of crazy club.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.330
Extreme fighting, or
some crap like that.

27:34.350 --> 27:37.450
Looked like that, and
worse, all the time.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.480
Worked pretty good for
his job, know what i mean?

27:39.490 --> 27:44.110
A fight club would be the perfect place
for the unsub to try to prove himself.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.440
And a beating might be the
stressor we're looking for.

27:46.450 --> 27:48.710
Do you know where this club is?

27:49.230 --> 27:51.330
Go, go!

27:53.330 --> 27:55.060
*****

28:14.420 --> 28:16.100
Fbi, get on the ground!

28:16.110 --> 28:19.490
Get on the ground right now! Get
on the ground! Get on the ground!

28:19.500 --> 28:21.640
Don't move! Get down!

28:21.650 --> 28:23.480
That way, let's go.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.530
Ain't breaking no laws here, officer.

28:25.550 --> 28:28.040
Agents, no matter what it looks like...

28:28.050 --> 28:30.230
I think he's trying to let us know
they have to right to be idiots.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.080
They do, but not here. Listen up, folks.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.980
This warehouse is not private property.

28:35.990 --> 28:39.540
It is owned by the city, which means...

28:39.750 --> 28:41.590
Y'all are going to jail.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.970
Pa 'em up, let's go.

28:42.980 --> 28:45.960
We ain't hurting nobody,
except maybe each other.

28:45.970 --> 28:48.740
Yeah, i feel you, but
we're still taking you in.

28:48.750 --> 28:52.160
Unless you want to answer some
questions and make all this go away.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.210
So ask me.

28:57.220 --> 29:00.570
- You know this man?
- Yeah. Boom.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.820
I heard. But i didn't kill him.

29:02.830 --> 29:04.760
No, but someone who came here did.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.220
No way. Boom could take all of us.

29:07.230 --> 29:09.030
We aren't looking for a tough guy.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.020
The man we're looking for
probably lost every fight.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.240
He came in here trying to be a man.

29:18.580 --> 29:20.930
But he failed.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.290
Guy went down easily.

29:24.600 --> 29:25.810
Candy ass.

29:25.820 --> 29:28.280
Maybe even in his first fight.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.150
He probably reacted poorly to that.

29:32.180 --> 29:35.350
To the point where you and
your boys, you ridiculed him.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.180
All this led him to pick up a gun.

29:41.230 --> 29:45.370
There was a guy.
Called himself "animal."

29:46.180 --> 29:52.390
Lost every fight, but he kept coming back,
getting in boom's face, calling him out.

29:54.380 --> 29:59.370
Most guys lose big, they run
home, tail between their legs.

29:59.570 --> 30:02.080
This one freaked.

30:16.780 --> 30:21.640
There's something about that hand
at your throat, when you're beat.

30:21.970 --> 30:26.400
Knowing your opponent's got
your whole life in his hand.

30:27.730 --> 30:30.840
Ah, it's primal, man.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.890
When he lingers...

30:36.910 --> 30:38.910
That's what he's doing to his victims.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.930
Proving his power over life and death.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.450
What's animal's real name?

30:42.470 --> 30:47.770
There's no names here. Just
nicknames. Like me. I'm beanie.

30:47.780 --> 30:50.160
Well, what do you know about
this animal? Anything at all?

30:50.170 --> 30:53.210
Nothing. That's the
way it works, you know?

30:53.220 --> 30:55.140
Don't talk about it.

30:55.150 --> 30:57.260
How about a description?

30:57.270 --> 31:00.460
Scrawny, white trash.

31:00.470 --> 31:02.450
Thought he's a whole
lot tougher than he is.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.660
Get him set up with a sketch artist.

31:04.670 --> 31:07.210
Beanie... Let's go.

31:07.220 --> 31:08.890
So what do we do now?

31:08.900 --> 31:10.280
We don't have a lot of choices.

31:10.300 --> 31:14.410
Based on his escalating timeline,
this guy's about to strike again soon.

31:14.430 --> 31:17.130
There's really only one thing we can do.

31:18.270 --> 31:23.230
Earlier today, the phoenix police
announced the suspect responsible for

31:23.240 --> 31:27.510
The deaths of 5 phoenix
officers had been caught.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.670
That is not the case.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.510
The killer is still at large.

31:33.330 --> 31:36.820
There have been quite a few mistakes made
over the course of this investigation,

31:36.830 --> 31:39.150
Mistakes that could have been avoided.

31:39.170 --> 31:44.220
As a result of this, the fbi is officially
taking charge of the investigation.

31:44.250 --> 31:48.260
We have established a tip line, and a sketch
of the subject is being released to the press.

31:48.290 --> 31:54.400
We encourage anyone with any information
about the shooter to contact us immediately.

31:56.610 --> 32:01.500
The man we're looking for is a narcissist and
a psychopath desperate to prove his masculinity.

32:01.510 --> 32:05.470
He does this by going after high risk
targets like gang members and police officers.

32:05.500 --> 32:09.720
Because hes a narcissist, this unsub will
be following the investigation closely.

32:09.740 --> 32:13.940
By pretending to take over the investigation,
we've put ourselves above the local police,

32:13.960 --> 32:16.030
Thus suggesting that
we're tougher to take out,

32:16.050 --> 32:19.250
And issuing the unsub a challenge
that he won't be able to ignore.

32:19.260 --> 32:22.370
And painting a target directly
on agent Hotchner's back.

32:22.390 --> 32:24.210
All the attacks, with the
exception of the last one,

32:24.220 --> 32:26.130
Have taken place in
the twelve's territory.

32:26.150 --> 32:30.310
This is the unsub's hunting ground,
and he's unlikely to stray from it.

32:30.330 --> 32:32.200
Where did you say you saw the suspect?

32:32.220 --> 32:33.850
Police department, how can i help you?

32:33.870 --> 32:36.350
Phoenix police hotle.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.310
Locations have multiple
vanish points for the shooter,

32:39.320 --> 32:41.890
But limited access and
exit routes for his victims.

32:41.900 --> 32:44.150
We'll be looking for
a similar situation.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.920
This should happen very quickly.

32:45.940 --> 32:49.660
Don't forget-- this guy managed
to take out 5 cops by himself.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.440
He smart, and he's fearless.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.040
He won't be easy to take down.

32:54.050 --> 32:55.400
Fbi tip line.

32:55.410 --> 32:59.220
I saw that guy. Your
killer. The one from tv.

32:59.570 --> 33:03.200
Male caller. He says he knows where the
unsub lives, and it fits the criteria.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.590
2717 gelson avenue.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.910
It's the twelve's territory,
just off the main street.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.280
Looks like there's a series of
smaller feeders and allies nearby.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.720
- This could be it.
- Let's go.

33:12.730 --> 33:15.610
Slow down, lieutenant. He'll
be expecting us. All of us.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.780
This is his last stand. He's
going to want to make it count.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.230
Yeah, well, this time we
know about it and we're ready.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.860
His trap could still work.

33:21.870 --> 33:23.990
15th avenue and gelson. What do
you know about the neighborhood?

33:24.000 --> 33:27.330
It's rough. Lots of
dead-end streets, allies.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.780
Major cross street, 17th.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.950
Residential? Any businesses at all?

33:30.960 --> 33:34.220
There's a gas station a couple of
blocks down, but that's about it.

33:34.230 --> 33:35.520
- Hey, Garcia?
- Yes?

33:35.530 --> 33:38.470
Can you get us a satellite
image of 15th avenue and gelson?

33:38.480 --> 33:42.750
But of course. Ok, real
time satellite image shows...

33:42.760 --> 33:44.600
Not a whole heck of a lot.

33:44.610 --> 33:50.380
I've got a 2-story apartment building, no
activity of any kind, no cars out in front.

33:50.390 --> 33:52.030
Oh, there's a car down the street.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.470
No heat registering,
engine must be cool.

33:54.490 --> 33:59.170
Satellite monitoring the last
12 hours is like library-quiet.

33:59.190 --> 34:02.570
A truck and 2 cars left in
the a.m., nothing came in.

34:02.590 --> 34:03.710
Thank you, Garcia.

34:03.740 --> 34:06.570
All right, there's a major street
in front on the east side, an ally,

34:06.590 --> 34:09.580
And 2 smaller streets to the
north and south right here.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.949
Lieutenant, commander, i
need a sniper here and here.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.590
Once they're set, the bulk of the
squad cars can approach from the south,

34:15.610 --> 34:17.620
And the rest of us from
the east very quietly.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.750
From this point forward,
everybody goes in on foot.

34:19.770 --> 34:22.860
Morgan, you and i go in first.
Rossi and Prentiss behind us.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.949
Jordan, you and Reid stay
here and work the tip line.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.980
- Stay safe, my loves.
- Thanks, Garcia.

35:16.590 --> 35:19.670
Clear! Clear!

35:25.740 --> 35:27.850
False alarm. We knew we'd get some.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.750
- What now?
- We wait.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.970
You might want to split your officers
into shifts. It could be a long night.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.950
Not this time. You're done.

36:42.230 --> 36:44.380
Let's go.

36:51.650 --> 36:54.120
You knew he wouldn't
be at the first address.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.440
We figured he'd wait
until Hotch was alone.

36:56.450 --> 36:57.990
So the tip was a diversion.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.180
Something like that.

37:01.190 --> 37:04.250
Thank you. And your team.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.390
No thanks necessary, lieutenant.

37:07.410 --> 37:09.580
We did it together.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.870
No, playboy!

37:46.400 --> 37:50.140
Hotch... Why don't you go on ahead?

37:50.150 --> 37:53.310
I think i'm going to stick around.
There's something i want to do.

38:24.890 --> 38:27.420
- Agent Morgan.
- Derek.

38:27.940 --> 38:29.410
This way.

38:32.590 --> 38:34.930
This is agent Morgan from the fbi.

38:34.940 --> 38:38.750
Maggie cunningham and
sam, my partner's family.

38:39.180 --> 38:41.880
Mrs. Cunningham, i'm
sorry for your loss.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.920
Thank you.

38:44.430 --> 38:48.790
Hey, sam... We got the
bad guy who did this.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.470
Sam, your father was a hero.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.500
Don't you ever forget that.

39:32.830 --> 39:37.260
"for he today who sheds his blood
with me shall be my brother."

39:37.290 --> 39:39.210
