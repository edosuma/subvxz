00:29.029 --> 00:30.374
Babe, leave it!

00:30.398 --> 00:31.208
Let's go!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.566
We gotta go now!

00:41.109 --> 00:42.443
Mommy.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.194
It's not him, Faith.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.996
Don't leave me, Mommy, please.

00:53.020 --> 00:53.963
That's not our son.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.165
Oh God.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.900
I don't wanna be alone.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.326
Faith, come on.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.899
Mommy, please.

01:08.702 --> 01:09.537
Faith?

01:11.939 --> 01:12.949
No!

01:12.973 --> 01:14.418
Faith!

01:14.442 --> 01:15.276
Faith!

01:18.646 --> 01:19.480
No!

01:40.234 --> 01:42.446
I'm like 100% sure
we passed this road already.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.680
Are you sure you're not lost?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.515
No, I know where I'm going.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.751
Feels like we're in
the middle of nowhere.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.254
That's because we are in
the middle of nowhere, Hailey.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.256
Even if we were in
the middle of nowhere,

01:52.280 --> 01:55.225
which we're not by the
way, we're in it together,

01:55.249 --> 01:56.460
and that's what counts.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.318
Wow Dad.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.864
Well I for one
like the sentiment.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.567
It's a big move, but
we are in it together.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.869
Well yeah, just us and Shae.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.071
Hey, your aunt Shae
needs us right now.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.005
You never know.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.441
You might like living with her.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.978
Yeah, reformed
addicts are the best.

02:15.002 --> 02:15.836
Hailey.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.517
Listen, I know this is hard,

02:20.541 --> 02:22.051
but it's not forever.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.589
When the time is right, we'll
get our own place, I promise.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.091
Great, no service.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.726
I am in hell.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.661
Ah, give you some perspective.

02:31.685 --> 02:35.632
Really, because from my
perspective, I see trees.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.302
Oh oh look, another tree.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.261
Hah, look another tree.

02:42.129 --> 02:42.963
Oh wow.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.414
Toddy Bear!

03:01.482 --> 03:02.426
Oh I missed you.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.260
I missed you too.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.093
You look great!

03:04.117 --> 03:04.994
Thanks, so do you.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.829
You look amazing.

03:05.853 --> 03:06.763
Thank you.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.664
Hi Jess.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.598
Hi.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.034
You made it, I'm so happy.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.168
Hi Hailey.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.403
How's it goin'?

03:13.427 --> 03:14.371
You wearin' your
dad's clothes now?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.672
That's awesome.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.374
Welcome to the
not-so-big city, guys.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.443
Also known as the
smallest town ever.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.712
Yeah, we're quite far, far
away from pretty much anything.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.248
Yeah, at night
you're gonna love it.

03:24.272 --> 03:27.150
It's super zen underneath
the stars with the crickets.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.676
I hate crickets.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.412
Who hates crickets?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.524
I do?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.726
Come on, let's go, I wanna
show you inside the house.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.495
How many times do
you think she says zen?

03:38.519 --> 03:41.522
Don't start, remember, zen.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.960
Wow, home sweet home, ladies.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.936
It's really old.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.773
It's called Victorian.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.293
It's got nice cross-breezes.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.994
Let me show you upstairs.

04:11.018 --> 04:11.852
Come on.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.831
Ah!

04:14.855 --> 04:16.333
I knew it.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.500
All right guys, be really
careful with the railing.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.702
It's super delicate,

04:18.726 --> 04:22.262
and I broke one of them
by accident already.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.643
Okay, so each bedroom is like
painted totally different,

04:26.667 --> 04:29.045
like different kind of
wallpaper, different colors,

04:29.069 --> 04:30.471
it's really cool.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.040
This is my room.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.209
It's a mess, shocker.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.757
And then Hailey,
that's your room.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.050
Oh wow, flowers, awesome.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.401
Well this is your room now.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.571
So pick a color
and we'll paint it.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.905
Surrounding yourself by flowers

04:55.929 --> 04:58.141
is actually really
good for your chi.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.710
You should consider keepin' it.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.303
And this is the master bedroom.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.440
Oh this is beautiful.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.624
Okay, I'm gonna
check out the bathroom.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.983
See ya, sport.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.928
You did good.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.898
This house is just amazing.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.668
Yeah this is perfect
for us, yes, good job.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.403
I knew you guys would like it.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.195
I'll leave you to it.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.211
I just hope her and
Hailey can get along.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.781
I can definitely sense
something brewing there.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.849
No, no, they're
gonna get along fine.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.686
The problem is
they're so much alike.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.713
They're both rebels
without a cause.

05:48.449 --> 05:52.095
Okay I think for Hailey
it's called being a teenager.

05:52.119 --> 05:55.456
But for Shae, I don't
know what that is.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.638
You know, Shae's been
through a lot with Mom's death.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.875
But I think having family
nearby is going to be

06:05.899 --> 06:07.276
really good for her.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.135
I agree.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.484
And with this new job, we
can finally get back on track.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.844
Which I'm very grateful for.

06:18.145 --> 06:18.979
Me too.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.228
Todd, not now.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.362
What?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.230
Come on, it's okay.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.331
Hailey's outside.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.933
Your sister is downstairs.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.601
Shae does not care.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.436
Well it's weird.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.438
No it's not.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.231
Todd, no I'm not in the mood.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.902
You're never in the mood, Jess.

06:46.039 --> 06:46.874
I'm sorry.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.510
It was a long drive.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.881
I'm gonna go unpack.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.604
Hey, so how did you find this place?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.072
Just responded to an ad.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.273
The neighborhood
looked really nice,

07:10.297 --> 07:11.941
and the house was really cheap

07:11.965 --> 07:13.209
considering the
size of the place.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.444
So I jumped on it.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.879
I'm so surprised that
it was even available.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.905
This house is fantastic.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.684
My real estate
agent said something

07:20.708 --> 07:22.719
about the local
economy being down.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.653
People aren't moving.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.488
Makes sense.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.490
Well, their loss.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.924
I think this place is fantastic.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.951
And I absolutely
love the furniture.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.330
When I saw those
baroque couches,

07:34.354 --> 07:36.600
I was like where do I sign?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.067
Baroque.

07:38.091 --> 07:42.305
Did the family before here
leave their broke couch?

07:42.329 --> 07:43.430
I guess so.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.734
Nothing really matches.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.703
It's called character.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.148
Hey, do I have to go
to school right away?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.484
Hey, yes, you have to
go to school right away.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.020
Is there a specific reason
why you don't want to?

07:57.044 --> 07:58.688
Come on Dad, think about it.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.623
The semester's almost over.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.324
I can start next semester.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.894
I'll work extra hard, and
then it'll be a nice break.

08:04.918 --> 08:05.753
Please?

08:07.387 --> 08:08.221
Please?

08:12.926 --> 08:13.927
Seriously?

08:14.962 --> 08:18.474
You guys are way
too easy on her.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.009
Seriously Shae?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.945
You don't really
have a say here.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.212
Excuse me Hailey.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.782
You do not get to talk
to your aunt that way.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.484
I'm sorry, I'm not the
crazy drunk in the family.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.553
Hailey.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.820
Wow.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.087
I'm not gonna be the
one that's passed out

08:32.111 --> 08:33.322
in the front yard.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.823
Now you're just
being a little brat!

08:34.847 --> 08:35.991
You don't get to act like
you're such a good person

08:36.015 --> 08:38.962
just because you're
finally sober!

08:38.986 --> 08:39.886
Or are you?

08:41.688 --> 08:42.966
Great!

08:42.990 --> 08:44.391
This house sucks!

08:59.172 --> 08:59.973
Crickets.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.318
Wow, nice shot, sport.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.333
What's going on with you?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.835
What do you mean?

09:51.859 --> 09:54.437
I mean you were very rude
to your aunt Shae last night.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.371
It's not like you.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.773
Yeah, well she's a hypocrite.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.131
And I hate that.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.110
How is she a hypocrite?

10:01.134 --> 10:01.945
She tries to tell everyone else

10:01.969 --> 10:03.179
how to live their life.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.139
She can't even get
her own life right.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.886
I get that, but you
have to understand.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.420
Your aunt Shae, she's
been through a lot.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.689
We need to be patient
with her, help her.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.291
Isn't she supposed to
be able to help herself?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.260
Isn't that what rehab's for?

10:17.284 --> 10:20.287
Sweetheart, can
you do me a favor?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.066
What?

10:23.090 --> 10:23.967
Can you be the
bigger person here

10:23.991 --> 10:25.993
so we can all get along?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.797
It'd mean a lot to me.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.575
Okay.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.277
That's the Hailey I know.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.344
I gotta go to work.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.379
Bye, Dad.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.647
You're good right?

10:37.671 --> 10:38.939
Scouts honor.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.273
This town sucks.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.142
Let's go find some trees.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.476
Woo!

13:48.628 --> 13:51.040
Wow, that's a cool bike.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.565
It's a Yamaha 125.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.968
Yeah, you ride?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.815
No, I'm just a big motorhead.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.085
Sorry, who are you exactly?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.152
I'm Hailey.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.154
Who told you about this place?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.123
Nobody, I just heard the music.

14:07.147 --> 14:11.127
So you took that as an invitation.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.962
Do you like Higher Flux?

14:12.986 --> 14:15.298
Yeah, I actually
saw them in concert.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.399
I'm so jealous.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.367
What are you doing here?

14:18.391 --> 14:20.403
I just moved here to Amityville.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.039
Where in Amityville?

14:23.063 --> 14:26.166
On Amity, right
where it dead ends.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.121
So where'd you see them?

14:38.145 --> 14:39.488
See who?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.424
Higher Flux.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.282
Oh, L.A.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.627
Oh that's cool.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.895
Is that where you're from?

14:45.919 --> 14:48.431
No, I moved here
from San Francisco.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.190
Okay, well welcome.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.597
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.843
Probably for the best.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.435
Nice to meet you.

15:03.770 --> 15:04.981
Yeah okay.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.716
I guess I'll just
see you around.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.142
See you around.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.841
Miss McCallister.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.801
Please, it's Delilah.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.038
Delilah.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.452
Oh, I guess you came for
the rest of the rent check.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.489
Sorry, I've been
painting all day.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.923
I'm really spaced out.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.948
An artist.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.419
It's more of a hobby really.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.066
Sorry I planned on dropping
this off to you later today.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.534
Hi.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.703
Oh, you must be Jessica.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.904
Jessica, this is Delilah.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.539
She's the property
manager on the house.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.664
Oh wow, hi.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.344
Just stopping by to
see how you're doing.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.213
We love the place.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.447
How's the garden?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.049
Oh, I've actually
never had one before.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.250
But the moment we moved in,

16:14.274 --> 16:15.484
I had the sudden urge
to just planting...

16:15.508 --> 16:16.719
Roses.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.686
Yes, exactly.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.654
I saw them outside.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.688
They're gorgeous.

16:19.712 --> 16:20.889
Thank you.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.058
Your husband and your daughter?

16:22.082 --> 16:23.226
Where are they, I would
love to meet them.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.261
Todd is at work, and Hailey,

16:25.285 --> 16:28.097
she's probably out
exploring or something.

16:28.121 --> 16:28.955
Pity.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.105
Do take care of the house.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.573
We will.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.867
Between you and I, it's
my favorite property.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.948
Oh, and don't let the
neighbors bother you.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.584
Why do they throw a
lot of crazy parties?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.319
No, they keep to themselves.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.321
You're just not gonna
make any friends.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.423
Oh, wow, that's all right.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.160
Well we have plenty of
drama in this family.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.962
Remember it's a small town.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.597
People like gossip.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.032
Don't you worry.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.969
What happens behind these
walls stays behind these walls.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.560
I'm sure it will.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.586
Hey.

17:23.609 --> 17:24.520
Hi.
Can I help you?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.753
Yeah I'm Todd Jacobson.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.954
I'm here to see Mike.

17:26.979 --> 17:27.890
Oh yeah, we've
been expecting you.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.158
Oh cool.

17:29.182 --> 17:29.825
Yeah I'm Karen,
nice to meet you.

17:29.849 --> 17:30.893
Hi Karen.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.419
Mike, Mike, hey.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.399
I got Todd here for you.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.233
What's up Mike?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.734
Hey Todd, Mike Arkos.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.436
Nice to finally meet you man.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.037
Glad to have you on board.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.005
Thank you.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.973
This is beautiful.

17:44.997 --> 17:45.841
What year is it?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.643
1955 Imperial.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.977
Fixing up for a friend of mine.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.045
She's a beauty, isn't she?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.680
Yeah, she's great.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.748
How is everything else going?

17:52.772 --> 17:53.582
Good man.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.950
Happy you're here.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.120
Now I can pay full
attention to the other shop.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.779
Come on, let me show you around.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.038
Jesus you scared me.
What?

18:16.062 --> 18:16.896
I'm sorry.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.644
Oh wow, who's your new friend?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.713
I found her while
I was planting roses.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.307
Well she is extremely creepy.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.585
She's not creepy.
No she's creepy.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.187
She's just old and dirty.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.721
Just like you.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.625
You know what, I
bet some little girl

18:36.649 --> 18:38.361
loved her very, very, very much.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.795
Oh no this isn't good.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.029
The problem with
these old houses,

18:41.053 --> 18:43.799
they have a big issue
with their plumbing.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.201
I'm gonna go check the basement

18:45.225 --> 18:46.769
for some drain cleaner.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.296
Have fun with your new friend.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.643
Hey Dad?

18:54.667 --> 18:55.668
Down here.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.819
This isn't ominous or anything.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.388
All basements
are ominous, honey.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.056
That's why they're
underneath the house,

19:08.080 --> 19:10.426
and not in the living room.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.861
So much junk down here.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.398
Who leaves this much
stuff when they move?

19:15.422 --> 19:16.599
I don't know,

19:16.623 --> 19:19.726
but it's basically
all cleaning supplies.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.108
Cool.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.887
Oh bingo.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.793
Everything's creep
about this house.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.486
Come on, let's go.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.731
Why is it that color?

20:22.755 --> 20:24.132
This is industrial strength.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.067
It's really potent.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.402
Actually stand back a bit there,

20:26.426 --> 20:27.370
because if this
gets on your skin,

20:27.394 --> 20:28.661
it'll burn you.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.720
Oh my God!

20:44.744 --> 20:46.255
Why does it smell like that?

20:46.279 --> 20:47.547
I don't know.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.252
Whoa, what's in this stuff?

21:27.454 --> 21:28.287
Shae?

21:35.362 --> 21:36.195
Shae?

21:37.897 --> 21:39.174
I can't get it open.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.367
Shae?

21:45.438 --> 21:46.382
Shae?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.708
Shae, open the door!

21:57.817 --> 22:00.396
Ah my skin is burning!

22:00.420 --> 22:01.630
I'm bleeding!

22:01.654 --> 22:03.332
Honey, I don't think
you're bleeding at all.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.400
It's probably just an acid trip.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.801
Not now, Hailey!

22:05.825 --> 22:08.070
I swear Todd, there is
something in the water.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.271
And it was burning me.

22:09.295 --> 22:10.373
It was burning my skin.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.242
The drain cleaner!

22:14.266 --> 22:15.478
You didn't check to see if
someone was taking a bath?

22:15.502 --> 22:16.645
Because that's not how
plumbing works, Jess.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.646
That's impossible.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.914
I couldn't get up.

22:18.938 --> 22:19.715
What are you talking about?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.007
I couldn't get up.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.653
Don't touch me!

22:24.677 --> 22:25.512
Get out!

22:29.982 --> 22:31.360
I told you, it
can't be connected.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.362
The drain cleaner,
it's impossible.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.631
What else was it, huh?

22:35.655 --> 22:36.889
I don't know.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.539
Maybe Hailey was right.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.208
Maybe she took something.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.543
Excuse me?

22:47.567 --> 22:48.444
Took something?

22:48.468 --> 22:49.277
Yeah, like...

22:49.301 --> 22:50.112
Oh great!

22:50.136 --> 22:51.580
Some acid or peyote.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.148
Great, we're
living with a junkie.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.217
You said she was
past all that, Todd!

22:55.241 --> 22:57.520
We're not living
with a junkie, Jess.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.987
I will keep an eye on her.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.456
It's not a problem.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.325
Listen, I get it,
she's your sister.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.528
But I have to make sure that you

23:05.552 --> 23:09.131
are not prioritizing your
sister over our daughter.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.299
Jess, I would never do that.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.668
Really, cause
you're doing it now.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.536
What does that mean?

23:13.560 --> 23:14.470
You gotta face it.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.538
Your sister's a drug addict.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.972
Our mother just died!

23:16.996 --> 23:20.275
She had one freak
out episode Jessica!

23:20.299 --> 23:21.744
Have a little compassion.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.678
Yeah, but you know what?

23:22.702 --> 23:23.946
The way you handled that episode

23:23.970 --> 23:24.947
seems like you've
done that before.

23:24.971 --> 23:25.881
How I handled it?

23:25.905 --> 23:26.815
I did everything I could!

23:26.839 --> 23:27.983
What are you talking about?

23:28.007 --> 23:29.251
You seem pretty natural with it!

23:29.275 --> 23:30.753
What?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.020
Is this something
that you guys grew up with?

23:32.044 --> 23:33.489
Did you do this when
you guys were kids?

23:33.513 --> 23:34.990
What's going on?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.525
You don't know that she's on drugs.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.460
She had one...

23:37.484 --> 23:38.393
She was on something.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.061
I know as much as you.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.463
I don't know.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.066
♪ Still wear it like a tattoo

23:44.090 --> 23:48.260
♪ Feel like magic and voodoo

24:03.610 --> 24:05.488
How's she doin'?

24:05.512 --> 24:07.179
She's calmed down.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.460
I checked her skin; She's fine.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.385
Well that's a relief.

24:16.723 --> 24:17.533
Look Jess, I'm s...

24:17.557 --> 24:18.558
I'm sorry.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.804
Come here, come here, no.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.329
Listen, I'm sorry.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.999
I'm sorry too.

24:28.434 --> 24:32.147
It's just, you know with all
this creepy and craziness.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.616
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.486
This is not the first
episode that she has had.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.021
Why does it even happen?

24:39.045 --> 24:40.756
Honestly, I don't know.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.391
It could be stress, trauma,
you know Mom's death

24:43.415 --> 24:44.917
is a lot for Shae.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.262
Morning sunshine.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.454
Hi.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.568
Have I told you how
proud I am of you?

24:52.592 --> 24:53.502
Why?

24:53.526 --> 24:54.937
Why, because you're brave.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.905
You're going to a new school,
and that totally sucks.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.007
But you're doing it,
and I'm proud of you.

24:59.031 --> 24:59.942
At this point
I'll take any reason

24:59.966 --> 25:01.476
to get out of this house.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.779
Well, whatever motivates you.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.380
It doesn't mean I
wanna go to school.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.682
Look you don't have to wanna go.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.117
You just have to
do it, and you are.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.653
So I'm proud of you.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.721
Fine, I accept your pride.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.956
Oh thank God!

25:13.980 --> 25:16.024
I wasn't sure where I
was gonna put it today.

25:16.048 --> 25:16.892
I'll see you later.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.126
Bye.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.094
No no no, wait wait wait.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.220
Hailey, I made breakfast!

25:34.000 --> 25:34.834
Hi.

25:37.604 --> 25:38.413
Is this your ball?

25:38.437 --> 25:39.271
Yeah.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.485
What's your name?

25:43.509 --> 25:45.120
Penny.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.354
I'm Hailey.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.656
I like your bike.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.157
I don't get to ride bikes.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.016
Yeah?

25:50.950 --> 25:51.894
You wanna check it out?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.929
I can't cross the line.

25:53.953 --> 25:54.954
What line?

25:58.457 --> 25:59.635
Oh.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.003
Did you meet Rachel?

26:01.027 --> 26:01.837
Rachel?

26:01.861 --> 26:02.671
My friend.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.807
She lives in your house.

26:04.831 --> 26:05.974
Oh did she move?

26:05.998 --> 26:06.833
No.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.878
Well just my family now.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.914
Rachel's there too.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.316
I haven't seen her.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.551
Doesn't mean she's not there.

26:33.860 --> 26:34.694
Yeah.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.005
Scott Green, please report

26:37.029 --> 26:38.607
to the principal's office.

26:38.631 --> 26:41.176
Scott, please report to
the principal's office.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.544
Hey.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.446
Hey yourself.

26:44.470 --> 26:48.951
You know, you didn't
have to disappear before.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.485
You could've hung out.

26:50.509 --> 26:54.222
Yeah, well your friends
weren't exactly inviting.

26:54.246 --> 26:58.417
Uh I don't know if I'd
exactly call them my friends.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.865
Okay, well let me
make it up to you.

27:02.889 --> 27:06.101
What are you doing after school?

27:06.125 --> 27:06.959
I work.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.537
My dad owns the tavern in town.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.606
I help him out.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.065
And after work?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.645
It's a bar.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.404
I get out kinda late.

27:19.772 --> 27:23.142
Okay, then I guess
I'll just see you around.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.457
Has anyone seen Mia today?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.293
I think she has her
period, Mrs. Taylor.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.795
Thank you Theresa
for the update.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.063
But I don't think we need to
know Mia's personal business.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.132
I just didn't wanna
be vague, Mrs. Taylor.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.500
Moving on.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.969
Let's start where we
left off yesterday.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.261
Exercise seven.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.008
Did you hear?

27:46.032 --> 27:47.342
Mia fucked Tim Bradley
in the back of his car,

27:47.366 --> 27:48.176
and he filmed the whole thing.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.511
And it went viral.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.313
Now she's never
leaving her room.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.982
I heard Mia went to the
Amity house on a dare.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.618
But that was weeks ago and
no one's seen her since.

27:56.642 --> 28:00.179
Shh, that's a lie
Sally, and you know it.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.257
What are you guys talking about?

28:02.281 --> 28:03.525
Nothing, new girl.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.860
Mind your own business.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.595
Yeah, mind your
business, Dirt Bike.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.264
That's not an insult.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.857
Whatever, Failey.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.627
Failey, you're doing it wrong.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.410
Girls, what's
going on over here?

28:22.434 --> 28:24.146
I tried to tell her to
be careful, Mrs. Taylor.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.348
But she wouldn't listen.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.941
All right, go get cleaned up.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.814
She won't last long.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.221
Um, what happened to you?

28:43.622 --> 28:44.632
Wet t-shirt contest.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.334
Room Eight, you missed it?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.003
Apparently.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.071
I didn't get the memo.

28:49.095 --> 28:49.929
Bummer.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.299
Here.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.280
It'll be like it never happened.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.138
Okay.

29:15.721 --> 29:16.531
Hello.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.226
Hello?

29:27.133 --> 29:27.967
Hey Shae?

29:29.068 --> 29:30.278
Shae, I'm out in the garden.

29:30.302 --> 29:33.381
So if the phone rings,
could you answer it?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.075
Hey, how's it goin' over there?

30:33.099 --> 30:35.034
Hey Mike, it's goin'.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.279
Yeah?

30:37.303 --> 30:38.113
Yeah, I'm busy.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.081
You okay?

30:39.105 --> 30:40.115
You seem a little bit out of it.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.850
Long night.

30:41.874 --> 30:44.386
Actually, let me
ask you somethin'.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.688
Have you ever heard of
drain cleaner backing up

30:46.712 --> 30:48.756
and coming out of
another faucet?

30:48.780 --> 30:49.591
No.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.558
Sounds crazy right?

30:50.582 --> 30:51.726
Technically impossible.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.761
That's what I said.

30:53.785 --> 30:54.853
Why?

30:58.757 --> 31:01.603
My sister Shae was
taking a bath last night

31:01.627 --> 31:03.705
and had this freak out episode.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.508
And now my wife is convinced
that the drain cleaner

31:06.532 --> 31:10.913
I poured into our sink somehow
came up through the tub.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.380
Wait, Shae Jacobson?

31:12.404 --> 31:13.215
Yeah.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.149
That's your sister?

31:14.173 --> 31:15.083
Yeah.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.651
Wow, I used to date Shae

31:16.675 --> 31:18.520
back in college for
about two years.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.621
Oh shit.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.423
You're that Mike!

31:21.447 --> 31:23.926
Yeah, you must be Toddy Bear?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.593
Toddy Bear.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.162
Man I haven't heard
from Shae in years.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.897
How did you guys
end up over here?

31:28.921 --> 31:30.899
Well she was up here
for a while actually,

31:30.923 --> 31:32.734
takin' care of our mom.

31:32.758 --> 31:35.003
And she passed, and at
the time it made sense

31:35.027 --> 31:37.305
for my family and her
to all move in together.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.440
And she actually
found a great house

31:38.464 --> 31:39.274
in the neighborhood.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.508
Where?

31:40.532 --> 31:44.112
Amity Way, at the
end of the cul-de-sac.

31:44.136 --> 31:47.906
So how did you guys
come across that place?

31:50.042 --> 31:51.519
She answered an ad.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.854
Shae is doing all right?

31:52.878 --> 31:54.389
Yeah, no she's fine.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.223
She's a tough cookie.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.758
So she bounced back.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.293
Look, I gotta go.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.362
I might drop by later
on to say hi to Shae.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.821
Okay, yeah sounds good man.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.708
Hey, I did the inventory,
and loaded the beers.

32:13.732 --> 32:14.676
Can I go meet the guys?

32:14.700 --> 32:15.877
Storage unit locked up?

32:15.901 --> 32:16.735
Yeah.

32:18.904 --> 32:21.316
Hey, Dad if you
need me to stay...

32:21.340 --> 32:23.618
No it's all right, I got
Jones comin' in at eight.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.811
You go on, get outta here.

32:29.048 --> 32:29.857
I'll be back later.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.459
How much later?

32:31.483 --> 32:32.651
Be home by 10.

32:33.652 --> 32:34.596
No excuses.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.454
Yes sir.

32:40.659 --> 32:41.493
Hey.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.229
Hey.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.674
I was just gonna
return your jacket.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.300
Right, thank you.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.647
How did you know I was here?

32:52.671 --> 32:55.917
You said you worked
at your dad's bar.

32:55.941 --> 32:56.884
There's only two in town.

32:56.908 --> 32:57.919
And one of them's a strip club.

32:57.943 --> 32:58.953
So I used my instincts.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.179
Right, right.

33:01.747 --> 33:05.793
Well I was jut about
to get outta here.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.729
You want a ride?

33:07.753 --> 33:08.920
Um, why not?

33:14.393 --> 33:15.661
Well come on.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.368
Woo!

33:46.392 --> 33:47.826
That was awesome.

33:48.794 --> 33:49.628
Oh man.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.331
Whew.

33:55.634 --> 33:59.347
So uh, you gonna tell
me why you feel the need

33:59.371 --> 34:00.548
to carry that thing around?

34:00.572 --> 34:01.716
My crossbow?

34:01.740 --> 34:03.151
Yeah.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.621
I mean, this is a
pretty safe neighborhood.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.223
You can never be too careful.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.791
It's a historical
fact that small towns

34:09.815 --> 34:12.494
are breeding ground
for serial killers.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.753
Wow, who said that again?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.165
History.

34:17.188 --> 34:18.790
Right, of course.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.869
You ever heard of a gun?

34:21.893 --> 34:23.395
Too predictable.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.000
You wanna try?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.170
No, I'm good.

34:34.840 --> 34:39.020
You ever actually shoot
anybody with that thing?

34:39.043 --> 34:40.922
No, but I wouldn't
mind putting an arrow

34:40.946 --> 34:43.458
through my aunt Shae's ass.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.928
Okay, so you don't
like her obviously.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.955
Nope, now I have
to live with her.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.056
That sucks.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.668
Yeah.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.272
She's gone absolutely crazy.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.940
She was in the
bathtub last night.

34:58.964 --> 35:01.343
She started screaming,
crying, the whole nine yards.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.645
She thought her sin
was burning off.

35:03.669 --> 35:04.946
Burning off?

35:04.970 --> 35:08.140
Yeah like acid
burning her skin off.

35:10.642 --> 35:11.853
What?

35:11.877 --> 35:13.988
Nothing, nothing.

35:14.012 --> 35:18.493
Anyway, she went crazy and
it made my parents fight.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.827
And so they got in to
this huge argument.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.087
And it was, seriously what?

35:25.591 --> 35:27.869
I shouldn't say anything.

35:27.893 --> 35:28.727
Okay.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.898
Something bad
happened in that house.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.843
What happened?

35:35.867 --> 35:39.647
A while back, this
kid, Jimmy Oberest,

35:39.671 --> 35:44.352
he poured acid in the bathtub
and drowned his baby sister.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.155
And then he killed his parents.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.013
Shit.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.982
It was a long time ago.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.561
Nobody even really
talks about it anymore.

35:53.585 --> 35:56.398
That's totally creepy.

35:56.422 --> 35:59.000
Won't be taking a
bath any time soon.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.235
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.661
No no no, I'm glad you did.

36:04.062 --> 36:07.566
It's nice to just have
someone to talk to.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.073
We should probably get going.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.077
Okay.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.429
Hello, hello, Shae?

36:44.035 --> 36:45.847
Yeah
boy, did you find a chicken?

36:45.871 --> 36:46.705
Hello?

36:48.106 --> 36:48.940
Hello.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.121
Shae?

36:54.145 --> 36:55.457
Shae, it's me Mike.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.549
Open up, we need to talk.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.130
Shae?

37:03.154 --> 37:04.990
Shae open up, it's me.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.949
Hey, where's Delilah?

37:21.973 --> 37:24.118
Screwin' around in the kitchen.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.525
Delilah.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.559
Mike.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.084
We have to talk.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.297
Don't stop.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.898
The people you moved
into Amity house,

37:36.922 --> 37:38.433
Shae is a good friend of mine.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.468
Shae I love her.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.903
She's an artist.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.839
Look, you have to
get them out of there.

37:44.863 --> 37:45.673
Stop.

37:45.697 --> 37:46.532
Just stop.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.221
I don't tell you how
to run your business.

38:00.245 --> 38:02.624
Don't tell me how to run mine.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.559
It's not right.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.193
You know it.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.130
Well the house can't be empty.

38:09.154 --> 38:11.666
As long as tenants pay, I
don't care who they are.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.525
You're a sick bitch.

38:16.595 --> 38:19.765
I love it when you
talk dirty to me.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.301
Hey Mike!

38:24.936 --> 38:27.582
It's like Vegas, baby.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.941
Never bet against the house.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.494
Shae?

38:54.032 --> 38:57.436
Shae, Jess is makin'
dinner I just, whoa.

38:58.704 --> 38:59.614
I'm sorry.

38:59.638 --> 39:02.040
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.519
What do you want?

39:04.543 --> 39:05.687
I don't want anything.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.954
Jess is making dinner.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.490
I was just wondering
if you wanted some.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.692
I'm not hungry.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.550
Okay.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.997
Are you feelin' all right?

39:16.021 --> 39:17.856
Do I look all right?

39:19.791 --> 39:21.192
You look tired.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.939
Well I feel perfect.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.466
Wanna see what I'm working on?

39:28.867 --> 39:32.037
No, no I'll wait
'til it's finished.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.971
Well that was...

39:56.995 --> 39:58.163
Yeah it was.

40:00.466 --> 40:01.843
Oh I...

40:01.867 --> 40:02.701
Keep it.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.071
I'll get it the next time.

40:07.105 --> 40:10.384
Son, you know what time it is?

40:10.408 --> 40:12.319
Dad, I'm sorry.

40:12.343 --> 40:13.921
You're sorry, then you
know how late you are.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.213
Get inside now.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.989
What are you doing?

41:55.013 --> 41:56.057
Your door was open, so I just...

41:56.081 --> 41:57.415
Put that down.

42:03.789 --> 42:04.999
Do you like it?

42:05.023 --> 42:08.193
Yeah, I mean the
colors are amazing.

42:09.394 --> 42:11.462
I think you got a keeper.

42:17.135 --> 42:17.969
Okay.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.175
You know what I think?

42:26.978 --> 42:28.923
I think you're just a puppet

42:28.947 --> 42:31.392
that says whatever her
daddy wants her to say,

42:31.416 --> 42:34.028
'cause she doesn't have
a personality of her own.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.864
I think you act tough and cool

42:36.888 --> 42:41.059
so you can hide who you really
are, forgettable, unloveable.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.405
Why would you say that?

42:44.429 --> 42:47.098
'Cause the truth is important.

42:50.268 --> 42:54.716
I wish you would've died
instead of your brother.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.584
He only pretends to love you.

42:56.608 --> 42:58.085
Think about how happy
your father would be

42:58.109 --> 42:59.444
if he had a son.

43:31.843 --> 43:33.454
Hailey.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.284
Hailey, are you okay?

44:51.890 --> 44:52.991
Ow, damnit.

45:14.712 --> 45:15.546
Ah!

45:17.348 --> 45:19.226
Have you seen Todd?

45:19.250 --> 45:20.085
Todd!

45:21.219 --> 45:22.220
Fuck, gah!

45:38.303 --> 45:39.113
Oh shit!

45:39.137 --> 45:39.947
Todd!

45:39.971 --> 45:40.948
Stop the leak.

45:40.972 --> 45:41.783
Todd, stop now!

45:41.807 --> 45:43.184
Turn this thing off!

45:49.147 --> 45:50.724
Todd, stop that, turn it off!

45:50.748 --> 45:52.193
Todd, turn the welder off!

45:54.752 --> 45:56.087
Stop, stop Todd!

46:01.827 --> 46:03.494
Turn the welder off!

46:05.163 --> 46:05.997
Todd!

46:15.573 --> 46:16.407
Ahh!

46:44.502 --> 46:46.313
You want a cigarette, Failey?

46:46.337 --> 46:47.281
No.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.183
You gonna tell on us?

46:49.207 --> 46:53.787
Why would I stop you from
slowly killing yourselves?

46:53.811 --> 46:56.390
Nobody knows when
they're gonna die, Failey.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.960
I'd treasure this
moment if I were you.

46:58.984 --> 47:02.096
Yeah, tomorrow could be your last.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.597
Maybe not.

47:03.621 --> 47:05.199
I saw the way you looked
at my boyfriend, btdubs.

47:05.223 --> 47:06.733
Sorry who's your boyfriend?

47:06.757 --> 47:09.203
Oh I think you know.

47:09.227 --> 47:13.398
Watch your back, Failey, or
you'll find a knife in it.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.005
Ladies?

47:22.207 --> 47:23.550
Hailey.

47:23.574 --> 47:24.418
What are you doing?

47:24.442 --> 47:25.752
She slipped and fell.

47:25.776 --> 47:27.012
Classic Hailey.

47:30.415 --> 47:31.225
Hailey?

47:31.249 --> 47:32.350
Yeah, fine.

47:44.930 --> 47:46.540
He lived in my house.

47:46.564 --> 47:48.509
I know it because my aunt Shae

47:48.533 --> 47:51.445
found his medical
kit in her closet.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.180
And in the picture, his
daughter's holding the same

47:53.204 --> 47:56.683
doll that my mom found
buried in the garden.

47:56.707 --> 47:59.653
Okay, so he lived there.

47:59.677 --> 48:00.854
So what?

48:00.878 --> 48:03.424
So there's no record
of him since 2004.

48:03.448 --> 48:05.350
He doesn't exist Brett.

48:07.953 --> 48:08.786
He's dead.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.334
He died in my house.

48:13.358 --> 48:17.238
His family died in
my house, I know it.

48:17.262 --> 48:20.641
I can't prove it,
but I've seen him.

48:20.665 --> 48:22.109
And then there's this music box,

48:22.133 --> 48:25.036
and it plays at
really weird times.

48:26.271 --> 48:27.438
Like it knows.

48:32.510 --> 48:33.945
Do I sound crazy?

48:36.014 --> 48:37.949
No, I don't think so.

48:47.025 --> 48:50.071
I can't think
about this right now.

48:50.095 --> 48:53.198
Yeah that's fine,
we'll just chill.

49:22.227 --> 49:23.770
I haven't seen you
around here before.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.007
What's your name?

49:26.031 --> 49:27.241
Todd.

49:27.265 --> 49:30.201
Todd, you must not
live around here.

49:32.203 --> 49:33.380
Just drivin' through?

49:33.404 --> 49:35.349
No I live here.

49:35.373 --> 49:36.941
Hm, lucky for me.

49:41.646 --> 49:43.590
I'm married.

49:43.614 --> 49:44.682
Didn't ask.

49:46.584 --> 49:49.687
What about you,
your first concert?

49:51.489 --> 49:54.225
I have never been to a concert.

49:55.493 --> 49:56.770
No way.

49:56.794 --> 49:57.704
Are you serious?

49:57.728 --> 49:58.905
Yeah.

49:58.929 --> 50:02.500
Not a lot of bands come
through Amityville.

50:03.901 --> 50:04.735
Right.

50:09.340 --> 50:14.021
We should run away, escape
to civilization some time.

50:14.045 --> 50:15.646
Go see a concert?

50:17.014 --> 50:19.826
I actually wanna manage
my own band someday.

50:19.850 --> 50:24.021
Well, you know more about
what you wanna do than I do.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.070
My dad gets a lot
of credit for that.

50:29.094 --> 50:31.705
Taught me everything I know.

50:31.729 --> 50:35.900
How to be curious, ride a bike,
shoot arrows, play guitar.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.380
You play guitar too?

50:39.404 --> 50:40.414
You play guitar?

50:40.438 --> 50:41.248
Yeah!

50:41.272 --> 50:43.784
Yeah, that's awesome!

50:43.808 --> 50:44.651
Yeah um...

50:44.675 --> 50:46.287
We should jam.

50:46.311 --> 50:47.588
If I can remember how to play.

50:47.612 --> 50:50.848
My mom was teaching
me before she died.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.529
I didn't know your mom was dead.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.363
Yeah.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.331
Sorry.

50:57.355 --> 50:59.557
It happened when I was 13.

51:03.161 --> 51:05.772
I'm just glad that I got
the chance to know her.

51:05.796 --> 51:06.631
You know?

51:07.565 --> 51:08.399
Yeah.

51:11.702 --> 51:14.372
I actually had a little brother.

51:17.175 --> 51:19.786
But he died when I
was really little.

51:19.810 --> 51:21.379
He was just a baby.

51:22.547 --> 51:24.649
I didn't know him at all.

51:27.017 --> 51:28.853
You know it's funny.

51:31.322 --> 51:34.235
A lot of time when
people find out

51:34.259 --> 51:38.163
that I lost my mom, they
try to be sympathetic.

51:40.565 --> 51:41.775
But I know that
for the most part

51:41.799 --> 51:43.301
they don't get it.

51:45.770 --> 51:49.174
It's just nice to meet
somebody who does.

52:14.332 --> 52:15.833
Come on, let's go.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.745
Where?

52:18.769 --> 52:23.016
I think I might know
somebody who can help us.

52:33.684 --> 52:36.863
Hi Brett, I was expecting you.

52:36.887 --> 52:39.032
Wow, this is your room?

52:39.056 --> 52:40.334
It's cool right?

52:40.358 --> 52:42.503
Those are my solar crystals.

52:42.527 --> 52:45.739
These ones absorb positive
energy, those deflect evil.

52:45.763 --> 52:46.807
Deflect evil.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.709
Yeah, keep out the bad energy.

52:48.733 --> 52:50.444
What about that
one around your neck?

52:50.468 --> 52:53.046
You told me it was
really powerful.

52:53.070 --> 52:55.282
Yeah, it's an ancient
protection crystal.

52:55.306 --> 52:56.650
It's been passed down
for several generations

52:56.674 --> 52:57.951
in my family.

52:57.975 --> 52:59.420
Can't part with it.

52:59.444 --> 53:01.855
Well do you have anything
like that for Hailey?

53:01.879 --> 53:03.424
She just moved to a new
place in Amityville,

53:03.448 --> 53:05.683
and her aunt is kinda nuts.

53:06.884 --> 53:09.930
Yeah, I have lots of
stones for new houses.

53:09.954 --> 53:11.765
Hailey go into the bathroom
and grab the floral bag

53:11.789 --> 53:13.967
in the third drawer.

53:13.991 --> 53:14.892
Okay, I...

53:16.361 --> 53:19.364
It's the second
door on the right.

53:20.965 --> 53:23.143
What are you doing?

53:23.167 --> 53:24.611
What do you mean?

53:24.635 --> 53:26.780
That's the new girl that
just moved to the Amity house.

53:26.804 --> 53:28.014
Yeah, how did you...

53:28.038 --> 53:29.250
Word travels fast.

53:29.274 --> 53:30.884
Not to mention, Theresa
is not a fan of hers.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.454
Come on Jenny, she
really needs your help.

53:33.478 --> 53:34.755
Of course she needs my help.

53:34.779 --> 53:36.223
Everyone needs my help.

53:36.247 --> 53:37.891
But I can't get
involved in this.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.125
You have to go.

53:39.149 --> 53:41.218
Hey, Jenny, is this it?

53:42.387 --> 53:43.220
Exactly.

53:45.323 --> 53:46.833
This is bloodstone.

53:46.857 --> 53:50.194
It's known for its
protective qualities.

53:51.629 --> 53:54.040
I think I'm gonna need
somethin' a little bigger.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.876
It was nice to meet you Hailey.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.312
Thanks for coming over.

53:58.336 --> 53:59.970
See you later Brett?

54:13.384 --> 54:14.285
Hey baby.

54:17.021 --> 54:19.924
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

54:21.659 --> 54:24.995
I was here the whole
time, sweetheart.

54:34.238 --> 54:36.073
I killed Mike today.

54:40.044 --> 54:40.878
What?

54:45.149 --> 54:46.484
I killed Mike.

54:48.185 --> 54:50.120
What happened?

55:05.570 --> 55:07.572
There was an accident.

55:08.839 --> 55:10.841
Well accidents happen.

55:13.444 --> 55:14.779
Not like this.

55:15.946 --> 55:19.417
There was fire and it
just happened so quick.

55:23.220 --> 55:25.723
And I saw the look in his eyes

55:29.360 --> 55:30.628
right before he

55:32.997 --> 55:34.765
right before he died.

55:49.814 --> 55:52.817
I just wanna make
you feel better.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.902
Todd, is that you?

57:21.405 --> 57:22.239
Jess?

57:31.281 --> 57:33.951
I had the strangest day today.

57:36.020 --> 57:38.689
None of my roses wanted to live.

57:40.591 --> 57:42.827
Nothing wants to live here.

58:28.673 --> 58:29.506
Hey.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.044
Hey.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.811
Hey.

58:57.835 --> 59:00.947
If I get involved in
this and people find out,

59:00.971 --> 59:03.850
you know what's gonna happen.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.109
Yeah, I know.

59:06.510 --> 59:09.756
And there's no guarantee
it's gonna change the outcome.

59:09.780 --> 59:12.192
Nobody, I mean nobody can know.

59:12.216 --> 59:13.594
I get it.

59:13.618 --> 59:16.053
Look Hailey is a good person.

59:18.022 --> 59:20.090
She doesn't deserve this.

59:21.358 --> 59:23.469
I have an idea.

59:38.709 --> 59:39.543
Oh.

59:46.684 --> 59:47.928
That's the living room.

59:47.952 --> 59:49.930
Kitchen's down
back through there.

59:49.954 --> 59:51.832
And your bedroom?

59:51.856 --> 59:53.190
It's upstairs.

01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:10.307
This is it.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:20.093
So you gonna rid the house
of evil spirits or something?

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.028
Can't get rid of the
evil, it's too powerful.

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:24.965
The best thing I can do
is create a safe place.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.633
A safe place?

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.369
Somewhere you can
go if things get bad.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.561
What do you mean by bad?

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:33.998
I mean bad.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.715
What about my parents?

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:42.983
You can bring them with you.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:45.385
This can be their
safe place too.

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:46.720
I'm gonna put these
around the room.

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:49.513
Whatever you do,
don't move them.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.228
Can I get some water?

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:56.697
Yeah, yeah of course.

01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:58.322
I'll grab you some.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.168
Hey, how's it going?

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:46.880
The spell's complete.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.839
I think you'll be okay.

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.057
Jenny!

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.015
Looks like someone
tried to help Failey

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:23.616
bite off more than she can chew.

Hello.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:59.212
Hi, I'm looking
for David Cranston.

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:00.713
Speaking.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.884
Awesome, I was actually
calling about your brother,

01:04:03.908 --> 01:04:05.585
Willis Cranston.

01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:06.776
Who is this?

01:04:07.912 --> 01:04:09.089
I actually moved into the house

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:10.756
I think your brother
used to live in.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.525
I found some of his
surgical supplies,

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:15.996
and I wanted to return them to...

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.864
Well that's very kind of you.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:21.467
But we haven't heard from
Willis for over a decade now.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.569
Would you mind if
I ask what happened?

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.071
I wish I knew.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.673
Once he moved to Amityville,
we never heard from him again.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.843
I contacted the police who
said that the property manager

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:34.314
said that they'd handed in
the notice and moved on.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:35.949
To be honest it
was very strange.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:38.618
He would never just have
left without telling me.

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:40.810
It doesn't make any sense.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:45.549
Who was the property
manager at the time?

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.187
McCallister,
Delilah McCallister.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.262
Well well.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.766
Honey, you know
trespassing is illegal.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.238
Put the files down.

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:28.712
I will cut out your
heart and eat it.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.120
How does somebody just
fall out of a closed window?

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:35.821
I don't know, Jess.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.258
And our neighbors just stood
around like nothing happened?

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:39.759
Hailey?

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.094
Dad, Dad I just went to
Delilah McCallister's house

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:45.531
and I found all of this
information about past renters.

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:46.732
There's been hundreds.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.167
Dad, hundreds!

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:49.100
Okay Hailey, slow down.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.270
What are you talking about?

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:51.737
Since the '70s,
people have been moving

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.139
in and out of our house.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:56.142
They never stay longer
than three months.

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:58.578
I'm willing to bet
they're all missing.

01:08:58.602 --> 01:08:59.812
Okay Hailey, this is crazy.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:01.080
Why don't you just
come home and...

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:02.715
Dad, you need to
get Mom and Shae,

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.149
and you need to get
out of the house.

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:05.885
Okay, I'm at the police station.

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.189
Hailey, Hailey?

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.046
Lost her.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.158
Dad?

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:13.626
Dad?

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.928
I just, I don't think that
we should be here anymore Todd.

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.162
I'm serious.

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.398
We're gonna wait for
Hailey to come home.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:19.499
We will leave first
thing in the morning.

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:21.066
I'm gonna go talk to Shae okay?

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.260
I'm gonna start packing.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:33.712
Hey.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:34.779
Brett?

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.482
Oh thank God, are you okay?

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.841
Yeah I'm fine.

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.953
I heard about Jenny.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.888
Look I am so sorry.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:46.125
Brett I think I know what's
happening with my house.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:47.393
Hailey hold on.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:48.728
Delilah is moving people in there

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:49.694
and killing them.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:51.287
It's not Delilah.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.189
I mean it is, kind of.

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:58.971
Do you remember what I told
you about Jimmy Oberest?

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:01.807
Yeah he drowned his
sister in a bathtub

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:03.676
with acid and killed his family.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.871
Hailey, Jimmy and his entire
family were into black magic.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.854
They believed if they made
these human sacrifices

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.189
that they'd be
granted eternal life.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.791
They killed people.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.216
Lots of people.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:23.829
Whatever they did, it was like

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:27.066
they opened a portal
to hell or something.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:29.134
What's Delilah's connection?

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:32.572
Delilah was Jimmy's baby sister.

01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:34.139
What?

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.741
Not the one he drowned.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:37.209
She had pneumonia.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.745
She was in a hospital during
the time of the murders.

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:42.282
Oh my God, I'm at
the police station.

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:45.385
And they're putting
Jenny's body in a trunk.

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:46.719
Look there's so much more.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.053
I need to tell you in person.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.322
Look, I gotta go.

01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:52.782
I'll meet you at the
cabin in an hour okay?

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:47.413
Todd?

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.938
Todd what's wrong?

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:50.916
Todd?

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.418
Todd let me out!

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.711
Todd I can't open the door!

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:02.352
Todd?

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:10.460
Todd?

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:18.735
Todd?

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:22.806
Todd!

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:38.988
Bad choice Brett.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:49.001
Bravo, I see you found
your family's new home.

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.202
Do you like it?

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:52.071
It's super cozy.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:54.474
Why are you doing this to me?

01:13:54.498 --> 01:13:56.500
I'm doing you a favor.

01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:59.445
You were marked
for death anyway.

01:13:59.469 --> 01:14:02.915
And trust me, this stuff is
better than the alternative.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.416
How was I marked for death?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.686
Nobody who lives in the
Amity house comes out alive.

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.721
And if we don't feed the house
and keep the spirits happy,

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:10.355
it comes for us.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:12.992
No one with a choice wants that.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:14.259
Right girls?

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.096
Sorry Theresa, but
your possessed house

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.455
is about to get real hungry.

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:26.038
Holy shit, T, you know
how she felt about her face!

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.944
You know Hailey, you and
I could've been friends.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.513
We have a lot in common.

01:14:33.537 --> 01:14:36.015
No, Theresa, we have
absolutely nothing in common!

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.550
I disagree!

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:39.519
We both loved Brett didn't we?

01:14:39.543 --> 01:14:41.487
Why'd you have to go and
steal my boyfriend, Hailey?

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:43.489
You have to ruin everything
you selfish bitch!

01:14:43.513 --> 01:14:45.024
Brett was never your boyfriend!

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:45.991
Yeah?

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.518
Well now he'll never be yours!

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:30.996
Oh my God, no!

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.665
No no no no no no no no!

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:35.591
Please please please
please please.

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:45.835
Shae!

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:32.675
Hailey.

01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:37.246
Hailey.

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:40.525
Hailey.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.485
You can't hide from me.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.393
Hailey!

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.379
It's vacant and
available immediately.

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:43.415
Thank you so much for
showing us your house, Delilah.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.451
We're looking for a nice
home to raise our family in.

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:50.856
I'm gonna have a
brother or sister.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.259
That's right, we're
trying for another.

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:57.062
Well that's wonderful
because we have three bedrooms.

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:58.397
Oh.

01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:00.099
It's exactly what
we're lookin' for.

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:01.233
Yeah.

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:03.759
I think we'll take it.
