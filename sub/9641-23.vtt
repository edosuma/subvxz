00:01.004 --> 00:03.974
Hey, guys! How's it going?
So, check it out:

00:04.008 --> 00:06.109
Mom sent more photos
of possible beaches

00:06.144 --> 00:07.644
for this year's
family photo.

00:07.678 --> 00:10.447
So, wait, we're supposed
to go to a place we never go

00:10.481 --> 00:12.949
and put our arms around
each other like we never do,

00:12.984 --> 00:14.551
just to have a picture
we can send

00:14.585 --> 00:16.520
to people we don't like,
anyway?

00:16.554 --> 00:18.622
This year, there's a record
number of families

00:18.656 --> 00:19.923
we don't like
to send 'em to.

00:21.425 --> 00:23.827
Alex, the annual barefoot
family portrait on the beach

00:23.861 --> 00:27.164
is very important. I recently
started painting my toenails

00:27.198 --> 00:30.167
in the off chance that I could
get in this year's picture?

00:32.302 --> 00:35.272
Of course you can, Harper.
You're a Russo now.

00:35.306 --> 00:36.473
Oh, my gosh!

00:36.507 --> 00:39.209
What am I gonna wear?
'Cause this is so drab.

00:41.112 --> 00:43.446
I need something
that says Russo.

00:43.481 --> 00:45.048
Oh! I know. I'll wear
that dress

00:45.082 --> 00:47.217
that says "Russo"
all over it.

00:48.653 --> 00:54.391
That I happened to have made
before I ever knew you people.

00:55.526 --> 00:56.526
Duh!

01:04.302 --> 01:06.870
And this is us:
making an entrance!

01:06.904 --> 01:10.440
And this is us:
shaking an entrance!

03:37.922 --> 03:40.623
That's great. 35 years
on the edge of show business

03:40.658 --> 03:42.459
has finally paid off.

03:42.493 --> 03:44.561
Paid off in spades.

03:44.595 --> 03:47.130
And diamonds and clubs
and hearts

03:47.164 --> 03:48.598

03:53.771 --> 03:55.739
You're back in.
Just like the old days!

03:55.773 --> 03:57.941
Wait, stop. I can't work
a gig with you guys.

03:57.975 --> 03:59.542
I live here now.

03:59.577 --> 04:01.411
We're even putting her

04:01.445 --> 04:05.415
We finally have enough

04:31.742 --> 04:34.511
Harper, can I talk

04:34.545 --> 04:36.679
- B-R-B.
- Gesundheit.

04:36.747 --> 04:38.381
Ah...

04:42.420 --> 04:45.055
OK, how can you not
want to go to Romania?

04:45.089 --> 04:47.123
Your parents are so fun.

04:47.158 --> 04:49.993
I mean, look at their ironic
clothes and hairstyles.

04:54.698 --> 04:56.699
It's not ironic, it's tragic.

04:56.734 --> 04:59.035
Where do they get
their sense of dress?

05:00.304 --> 05:02.705
OK, well, what about how
they make everything a joke?

05:02.740 --> 05:04.741
Yeah, try living with them
for a few years.

05:04.775 --> 05:07.310
He's been making fun of
how old I am since I was seven.

05:07.344 --> 05:08.978
Seven!

05:11.449 --> 05:13.116
We're really sorry
to take your little lady

05:13.150 --> 05:14.451
away from you like this.

05:15.386 --> 05:16.886
What are you talking about?

05:16.921 --> 05:18.755
Word on the street
is you two lovebirds

05:18.789 --> 05:20.657
are quite a big ticket item.

05:20.691 --> 05:22.959
Oh!

05:24.662 --> 05:26.229
Me and Harper?

05:26.263 --> 05:29.165
Uh, no, sorry.
Harper is dating Zeke.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.603
- Zeke Beakerman.
- Zeke Beak-erman? It rhymes!

05:35.172 --> 05:37.107
Must be a stage name.

05:37.141 --> 05:38.975
The last thing we need
is for our daughter

05:39.009 --> 05:41.478
to date another
"Johnny Stage Door. "

05:41.512 --> 05:43.746
Being a couple of loose cannon,
undependable,

05:43.781 --> 05:44.781
showbiz-types
ourselves,

05:44.815 --> 05:46.716
we were hoping our daughter

05:46.750 --> 05:49.085
would wind up
with some nice, boring,

05:49.120 --> 05:51.054
accountable square
like yourself.

05:55.793 --> 05:56.993
Dad...

05:57.027 --> 05:58.828
Did they just call me
a boring square?

05:58.863 --> 06:01.998
Well, you are sort of...
a square.

06:02.032 --> 06:04.000
- Wha...?
- I mean that in the best way.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.969
- I...
- Like, you're not afraid to be yourself.

06:06.003 --> 06:08.505
You know... a boring square.

06:08.539 --> 06:11.875
Everyone thinks
I'm a boring square?

06:14.378 --> 06:17.013
They are not going to believe
this down at the Hobby Shop.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.949
I can hear 'em laughing now.

06:24.221 --> 06:26.890
Finkles, I got
a question for you.

06:26.924 --> 06:30.026
Would you ever make your
kids take a lame family photo

06:30.060 --> 06:33.163
- while wearing the same clothes?
- It's not lame, Alex.

06:33.197 --> 06:35.031
It's a family tradition.

06:35.065 --> 06:36.900
The Finkles have a
family tradition, too.

06:36.934 --> 06:38.868
It's called,
whoever falls asleep first

06:38.936 --> 06:41.004
gets a mustache
drawn on your face.

06:41.038 --> 06:42.805
Guilty as charged!

06:42.840 --> 06:44.407
I'm a napper.

06:44.441 --> 06:46.976
You guys are awesome.

06:47.011 --> 06:49.646
If Harper doesn't want
to be in your act, I'll do it.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.347
Wow. You'll do anything

06:51.382 --> 06:53.149
to get out of realizing
your brother's dream

06:53.184 --> 06:56.052
of forming a family pyramid
in the sand, won't you?

06:56.086 --> 06:57.587
Pretty much.

06:59.056 --> 07:02.025
"Alex Finkle" sure
sounds swell to me.

07:02.059 --> 07:03.293
Is this OK with you, buddy?

07:03.327 --> 07:04.594
Well, I don't wanna do it.

07:04.628 --> 07:06.296
I'm really loving
being a Russo. Oh...

07:06.330 --> 07:08.598
Hey, can I be the top
of the human pyramid?

07:10.434 --> 07:12.602
Sold!
Welcome to the Finkles, buddy.

07:12.636 --> 07:14.304
Rehearsal's at one o'clock.

07:14.338 --> 07:17.207

making an exit.

Hey, be sure to turn that
thing off when we're gone.

the batteries!

07:36.994 --> 07:39.562
I don't think you know what
you're getting yourself into.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.097
I'll be fine. I mean...

07:41.131 --> 07:42.699
You like being a Russo so much,

07:42.733 --> 07:45.168
it'll be cool for me to try
and be a Finkle for awhile.

07:45.202 --> 07:48.638
- Do you even know
where Romania is?

07:48.672 --> 07:52.742
Yes. It's in Rome. Duh!

07:52.776 --> 07:54.744
I know my states.

07:55.846 --> 07:58.314
- She's right, you know.
- No, she's not.

07:58.349 --> 08:01.517
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. D
in geography.

08:01.552 --> 08:05.088
Romania is a country
in Eastern Europe

08:05.122 --> 08:08.191
that's full of gymnasts
and vampires.

08:09.226 --> 08:10.727
Gymnasts and vampires?

08:10.761 --> 08:14.097
Maybe Justin can come with
and find a new girlfriend.

08:14.131 --> 08:16.532

the Finkle rhythm down.

08:16.567 --> 08:19.736
<i>#And cue the applause ♪</i>

08:28.846 --> 08:31.281
I don't know what to do about
Alex without Theresa here.

08:31.315 --> 08:33.316
I mean, Theresa always
tells me what to do.

08:33.350 --> 08:35.351
Well, can't you just
tell Alex she can't go?

08:35.385 --> 08:36.452
You're her Dad.

08:41.325 --> 08:43.493
Well, Dad, whatever
you tell her to do,

08:43.527 --> 08:45.028
she's just gonna do
the opposite.

08:45.062 --> 08:46.863
Unless she knows
what you're gonna do

08:46.897 --> 08:49.799
and then she'll do
the opposite of that.

08:49.833 --> 08:53.636
So, we gotta find something
that's not opposite.

08:58.876 --> 09:00.510
Max is right.

09:00.544 --> 09:03.146
We'll use reverse psychology.
We'll tell her she has to go,

09:03.180 --> 09:05.081
and then she won't want to.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.282
That could work.

09:07.418 --> 09:09.218
Good idea, Max.
Thanks for your help.

09:11.121 --> 09:14.123
Harper, Justin told me
what your parents said.

09:14.158 --> 09:15.458
And you don't have to worry.

09:15.492 --> 09:17.760
I'm going to turn myself
into the boring loser

09:17.795 --> 09:19.462
that your parents
want me to be.

09:21.365 --> 09:23.299
They didn't say
"boring loser. "

09:24.601 --> 09:26.235
No, but they were
thinking it.

09:27.504 --> 09:29.639
Or at least I was.

09:31.008 --> 09:33.643
Why does everyone think
that I'm a boring loser?

09:33.677 --> 09:36.846
I am just as engaging
and entertaining as Zeke.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.716
Whoa, bro, not so fast.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.718
Are you the captain of three
different clogging teams?

09:41.752 --> 09:43.753
I don't think so!

09:43.787 --> 09:48.291
Oh, no! I didn't think about how
cool my clogging comes across.

09:48.325 --> 09:50.860
He is interesting!

09:53.530 --> 09:55.565
Zeke, wait.
Let's talk about this.

09:55.599 --> 09:58.234
No, no. If your parents
want me to change,

09:58.268 --> 09:59.502
then I'm gonna change.

09:59.536 --> 10:01.838
Starting today, I'm gonna
somehow suppress my urge

10:01.872 --> 10:05.141
to do a Double Stomp,
followed by the Mountain Goat.

10:10.981 --> 10:14.484
All right. Later, Russos. This
Finkle's gotta get to rehearsal.

10:14.518 --> 10:17.353
Alex... I just wanted
you to know that

10:17.388 --> 10:21.090
we all want you to go
to Romania with the Finkles.

10:22.559 --> 10:23.760
OK. Love you. Bye.

10:27.131 --> 10:28.998
Dad, that wasn't opposite
enough.

10:29.032 --> 10:30.767
You should have
said something like:

10:30.801 --> 10:35.471
"We want you to go
to Finkles with Romania. "

10:48.085 --> 10:50.686
Hey, guys, I thought of
something I can do in the act.

10:50.721 --> 10:52.121
Watch this.

10:55.859 --> 10:56.993
Pretty good, huh?

10:57.027 --> 10:59.095
I think it's gonna pull
the whole show together.

11:02.199 --> 11:03.199
Hacky.

11:03.233 --> 11:05.134
And you're late for rehearsal,
buddy.

11:05.169 --> 11:06.936
Only a couple of minutes.

11:06.970 --> 11:10.239
Show biz minutes are a million times
more precious than regular people minutes.

11:11.642 --> 11:13.643
Sorry.
I didn't know.

11:13.677 --> 11:16.112
You guys are a lot more
serious than I thought.

11:16.146 --> 11:17.380
You wanna be part
of this outfit,

11:17.414 --> 11:19.248
you gotta fly on
the straight and narrow.

11:19.283 --> 11:21.317
You wanna be part
of this outfit, don't you?

11:23.086 --> 11:26.389
A couple of regular people
minutes ago I did.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.158
Well, you better decide,

11:29.193 --> 11:31.027
'cause this crazy
show biz shebang

11:31.061 --> 11:33.196
is a whole lot of
blood and sweat.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.531
But, if you do it right,
you get the laughs,

11:35.566 --> 11:39.502
you get the fame
and the moola!

11:41.104 --> 11:43.406
Well, fame and moola
sounds good.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.508
Actually, "moola"
sounds gross.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.144
Sounds something le
a French cow would say.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.780
"Moo-la-la. "

11:51.648 --> 11:55.084
Yeah? Yeah? Nothing?
Really?

11:55.118 --> 11:56.385
You got moxie, buddy.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.956
In fact,
that's your new name...

11:59.990 --> 12:02.024
Moxie Finkle!

12:02.059 --> 12:04.393
Try it on for size.
Walk it around a bit.

12:05.762 --> 12:09.298
"Moxie?"
Sounds like a dog's name.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.434
What's next?
Do I get my own squeaky toy?

12:11.468 --> 12:13.803
Too much lip.
That's it. She's out!

12:13.837 --> 12:16.839
Aw, come on, Marty.
Give the rookie a break.

12:16.874 --> 12:18.908
Nope. I'm done with her.

12:18.942 --> 12:21.310
Sorry, I tried.
Hit the road.

12:21.345 --> 12:25.681
And if you hurry, you might make
that little family photo shoot.

12:25.716 --> 12:27.950
Smile big, sad clown.

12:29.119 --> 12:30.620
Looks like we've
gotta replace her.

12:30.654 --> 12:32.355
Hey, buddy,
how about telling Harper

12:32.389 --> 12:35.324
- to hightail it over here.
- Harper?

12:35.359 --> 12:37.660
She's kind of happy
not doing this.

12:37.694 --> 12:40.029
Harper doesn't care
about being happy.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.465
Harper cares about
making other people happy.

12:42.499 --> 12:45.234
She's a Finkle!

12:47.337 --> 12:50.606
All right...
I'll be Moxie Finkle.

12:50.641 --> 12:53.442
Well, as long as we know
who's calling the shots now,

12:53.477 --> 12:54.944
let's get back
to business.

12:54.978 --> 12:58.381
We only got this place booked
for nine more hours.

12:58.415 --> 13:01.517
- What? Nine hours?
- Yeah.

13:01.552 --> 13:03.219
It's gonna take you
at least six hours

13:03.253 --> 13:05.021
to learn how to
play the ukulele.

13:05.055 --> 13:08.291
And two more to do it
while you're juggling.

13:08.325 --> 13:11.227
That only leaves one hour
to learn all your lines.

13:13.463 --> 13:16.666
Homework? I thought this
was gonna be fun.

13:26.486 --> 13:29.665
OK, Alex on the Way Home,
If we don't come up with a new plan quick,

13:30.199 --> 13:32.301
she's gonna be ending every sentence
for the rest of her life with:

13:32.335 --> 13:35.504
<i>#And cue the applause! ♪</i>

13:37.340 --> 13:40.542
Theresa won't like me even more
if her family picture is ruined

13:40.576 --> 13:44.813
because one of her family members
is living on a train in Romania.

13:44.847 --> 13:47.983
And not the family member
she'd be OK with.

13:53.456 --> 13:55.223
I'm telling Justin.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.429
OK, what would Theresa
do in this situation?

14:00.463 --> 14:03.432
Well... Mom and Alex
usually have these

14:03.466 --> 14:06.101
heart-to-heart girl-talk
kind of things by themselves.

14:06.135 --> 14:07.969
Out on the terrace.
That's where they do it.

14:08.004 --> 14:09.771
You're right again, Max.

14:09.806 --> 14:11.773
And since you're so good
at filling in for Mom,

14:11.808 --> 14:13.008
why don't you do that?

14:14.277 --> 14:15.544
Why not Harper?
She's a girl.

14:15.578 --> 14:19.715
Oh... Harper's been completely
useless in this situation.

14:22.952 --> 14:26.154
I'd be upset, but you saying
that to my face like that...?

14:26.189 --> 14:28.690
It makes me feel like
I'm part of this family.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.828
I'm exhausted.

14:32.862 --> 14:35.864
All right, here she is.
Go girl-talk it up.

14:38.735 --> 14:39.868
Alex?

14:41.170 --> 14:44.106
Can I talk to you
out on the terrace, please?

14:48.611 --> 14:50.245
Well, that's weird, so yeah.

14:58.187 --> 15:01.823
Come on. You and Mom
usually stand over here

15:01.858 --> 15:03.658
and look out
over the city.

15:08.664 --> 15:10.966
<i>So listen, mija,</i>

15:11.000 --> 15:13.735
when we were saying you should
go to Romania before,

15:13.770 --> 15:15.637
we were really saying
you shouldn't go.

15:15.671 --> 15:18.206
Max, I know. Reverse psychology.
I got it.

15:18.241 --> 15:20.041
Right. So, now I'm saying
you shouldn't go.

15:20.076 --> 15:22.244
I'm not. I already decided
how I'm getting of it.

15:22.278 --> 15:24.312
- So, you're not going?
- No.

15:25.081 --> 15:26.415
Oh, I got you.

15:26.449 --> 15:29.418
So you're using
reverse psychology on me.

15:29.452 --> 15:31.219
No, I'm really not going.

15:31.254 --> 15:33.054
The more you say
you're not going,

15:33.089 --> 15:34.956
the more I know
you actually are going.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.727
Good talk, Max.

15:40.563 --> 15:42.764
But wait, Alex, we were
supposed to hug now.

15:45.735 --> 15:48.437
My little girl is
growing up so fast.

15:48.471 --> 15:50.172
What happened? What happened?

15:50.206 --> 15:52.607
She went upstairs and
didn't tell us what she's doing.

15:52.642 --> 15:56.511
Well, she's going.
She's definitely going.

15:56.546 --> 16:00.582
- She didn't even hug me.
- Oh, no.

16:00.616 --> 16:02.417
What are we gonna do now?

16:02.452 --> 16:04.619
Well, I've lived with you
Russos for some time now

16:04.654 --> 16:06.254
and it seems like most
of your problems

16:06.289 --> 16:07.889
are solved right after chaos.

16:07.924 --> 16:10.292
So, maybe that's what we
should do. We need chaos.

16:10.326 --> 16:11.693
Right.

16:11.727 --> 16:14.496
Chaos could blow
the audition for Alex.

16:14.530 --> 16:17.432
See, she's not
that useless.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.267
Aw, thanks for the compliment.

16:19.302 --> 16:21.636
I can hear you when you when
you do the... that, yeah.

16:30.746 --> 16:34.149
Did Alex get into
Mommy's makeup again?

16:36.385 --> 16:37.819
OK, good, so it's working.

16:37.854 --> 16:40.989
I'm off to go blow my audition.
It's go time or no time!

16:42.658 --> 16:44.659
Why would you sabotage
the audition?

16:44.694 --> 16:46.761
Because I don't want to go
to Romania anymore.

16:46.796 --> 16:49.331
Oh, so you'd rather
be a Russo than a Finkle?

16:49.365 --> 16:50.999
I know. Weird, right?

16:52.068 --> 16:55.103
Turns out the Finkles
really stink-le.

16:57.473 --> 16:59.207
All right, well,
now it's a toss up.

17:00.409 --> 17:03.512
The truth is, if I don't go,
Harper has to go.

17:03.546 --> 17:06.414
And I don't want her to leave.
So, the only solution is

17:06.449 --> 17:08.183
to ruin it so nobody can go.

17:08.217 --> 17:11.786
Well, if there is one thing you're
really good at, it's ruining things.

17:11.820 --> 17:13.521
Aw, thank you.

17:17.693 --> 17:22.497
<i>#And the smallest of all

17:24.000 --> 17:25.433

17:36.045 --> 17:37.546
I just said that part.

17:39.248 --> 17:41.416
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:41.450 --> 17:45.320
Am I messing this up in front
of the Romanian producers?

17:45.354 --> 17:47.656
Gymnast and vampire,
figures.

17:49.725 --> 17:52.360
Why don't we just quit
while we're ahead?

17:52.395 --> 17:54.796
Well, looks like somebody
fried their old brain

17:54.830 --> 17:57.132
watching too much of
the old boob tube.

17:59.101 --> 18:02.103
That's not all she fried.
Get a load of that crazy 'do.

18:02.138 --> 18:03.738
Who does your
hair and make-up, Moxie,

18:03.773 --> 18:05.740
a near-sighted
orangutan?

18:08.678 --> 18:13.081
This is the perfect comedy
for our train!

18:13.115 --> 18:14.716
The people will love it.

18:16.452 --> 18:18.787
What?
No, no, no!

18:18.821 --> 18:20.989
I've gotta get out of here
before they put me on a train.

18:24.427 --> 18:27.729
- What are you doing?
- Proving to the Finkles that I am not a boring square.

18:27.763 --> 18:30.231
I am exciting!

18:30.266 --> 18:31.833
I'm gonna use
the "Ham It Up" spell.

18:33.135 --> 18:34.970
Tell some jokes
all old and clammy.

18:35.004 --> 18:37.472
Then make me act
all bold and hammy.

18:52.622 --> 18:54.122
Ha!

18:56.559 --> 18:57.959
Hello there, Finkles.

18:57.994 --> 18:59.995
Mind if I "choo" up
little scenery?

19:00.029 --> 19:01.129
Justin?

19:01.163 --> 19:03.632
A- choo, a-choo, a-choo,
and a-choo!

19:05.034 --> 19:06.901
Would you guys get
a load of these two?

19:06.936 --> 19:09.771
I mean seriously,
their act stinks so bad,

19:09.805 --> 19:12.273
onions cry when
they watch it.

19:12.308 --> 19:15.410
Am I right, Romanians?

19:16.345 --> 19:18.179
Aw, Justin! What is this?

19:18.214 --> 19:20.148
Boy, was I wrong about you.

19:20.182 --> 19:22.617
Yeah, quit stealing our thunder.
You're gonna ruin our audition.

19:23.819 --> 19:25.053
Oh, really?

19:26.355 --> 19:28.823
Then, let's ruin it
some more.

19:34.664 --> 19:37.298
A one, a two, a one, two, three!

19:40.036 --> 19:42.504
Hey, everybody, I haven't
seen an act this bad

19:42.538 --> 19:44.873
<i>since my brother starred
in Vida Romania.</i>

19:46.542 --> 19:48.877
Oh, Moxie, not you, too?

19:50.713 --> 19:53.982
All right,
time to create chaos.

19:54.784 --> 19:56.451
I'll throw the first tomato.

19:57.386 --> 20:00.288
Shh. Wait. Listen.

20:00.322 --> 20:01.923
Do you smell that?
I smell ham.

20:01.957 --> 20:05.293
Spiral cut,
hind quarter.

20:05.327 --> 20:08.229
Probably on sale. This way.

20:10.366 --> 20:12.701
- Hey, brother o' mine?
- What's up, sissy-poo?

20:12.735 --> 20:14.069
I'll tell you what's down.

Stop! Stop this
perfect train comedy!

20:46.936 --> 20:48.870
We've made a decision.

20:48.904 --> 20:53.441
You won a job with
the Black Sea Railways!

20:55.177 --> 20:57.145
Well, this is some
kind of rigmarole.

20:57.179 --> 21:00.815
Yeah. These two goofballs
just high-jacked our set.

21:00.850 --> 21:03.084
Oh, not to worry, Finkles.

21:03.119 --> 21:05.954
We have another
gig available...

21:05.988 --> 21:09.491
...in Youngstown, Ohio!

21:09.525 --> 21:11.326
We'll be in touch.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.961
Did you hear that?

21:12.995 --> 21:16.798
- Nobody's better than us.
- How do you like that?

21:16.832 --> 21:20.635
Ah. That took a lot less
chaos as I thought it would.

21:20.669 --> 21:23.471
I'm sorry, Finkles.
I'm dating your daughter.

21:23.506 --> 21:24.645
I'm not dating you.

21:24.941 --> 21:28.643
So, tonight, I'm expressing
my love for Harper

21:28.878 --> 21:32.380

of the clog!

21:44.375 --> 21:46.710
I hope it's OK that I'm not
going to Youngstown with you.

21:46.744 --> 21:50.447
It sure is, buddy. We were wrong
to make you do that before.

21:50.481 --> 21:52.716
We can see now that
you got a real sweet deal

21:52.750 --> 21:54.618

21:54.652 --> 21:55.952
I sure do.

21:55.987 --> 21:58.254

22:01.392 --> 22:03.226
See ya, buddy.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.862
And this is us...
making an exit.

22:07.732 --> 22:11.401
Ah, show business!

22:19.410 --> 22:21.144
