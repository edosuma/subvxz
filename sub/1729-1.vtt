01:21.292 --> 01:25.000
In 1862, during the Joseon Dynasty,

01:25.584 --> 01:31.417
The people suffered from famine and plague,

01:31.709 --> 01:37.209
as well as unrelenting
exploitation from corrupt officials,

01:37.709 --> 01:41.584
as well as noblemen.

01:43.125 --> 01:48.375
Peasant revolts were far too common.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.709
Those captured were executed for breaking the law,

01:56.750 --> 02:03.209
while others fled to the woods
and lived as bandits.

Act 1: Chusul Clan of Mt. Jiri

03:06.334 --> 03:10.167
This is Lord Jo Won-suk's son Jo Su-in.

03:11.375 --> 03:14.500
My father's had a stroke and could not attend,

03:14.959 --> 03:17.542
pardon me for coming in his place.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.292
Hope he recovers soon.

03:24.167 --> 03:26.167
It's ivory.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.542
My father's small gesture...

03:31.250 --> 03:34.459
He sincerely congratulates you on your 60th.

03:37.292 --> 03:41.584
Tell him his gift is happily accepted.

03:43.834 --> 03:47.500
I brought this from China especially for you,

03:47.667 --> 03:51.209
it's called a telescope.

03:51.334 --> 03:55.917
It allows you to see things far in the distance.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.667
Extend it out.

03:58.834 --> 04:01.000
Let me try this.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.292
That's amazing!

04:13.750 --> 04:17.791
The Chinese ambassador told me
that you have an eye

04:17.875 --> 04:21.541
for precious Chinese goods.

04:24.542 --> 04:26.542
Governor...

04:27.209 --> 04:31.792
If you'll grant me a private audience,

04:31.917 --> 04:35.542
good fortune will find you.

04:38.292 --> 04:39.917
In a moment.

04:40.042 --> 04:41.375
Of course.

04:58.584 --> 05:00.917
You rude bastards!

05:01.250 --> 05:04.375
Your mourning is ruining our party!

05:04.459 --> 05:05.459
Off you go!

05:05.500 --> 05:09.917
The dead man stopped for the scent of beef.

05:10.084 --> 05:12.292
Don't be so stingy.

05:12.417 --> 05:15.875
Share some of your leftover soup with us.

05:15.959 --> 05:20.125
That is the shittiest bullshit I've ever heard.

05:20.292 --> 05:23.084
Dead men can't smell shit!

05:23.250 --> 05:25.792
He died of starvation,

05:26.084 --> 05:27.875
so if the Governor releases his spite,

05:27.959 --> 05:31.959
good fortune will follow.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.167
The compassion of Buddha.

05:36.459 --> 05:41.792
Even death is not to be feared by
one who has lived wisely.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.625
Rest in peace.

05:51.042 --> 05:54.125
Now that it's over, get going!

05:54.917 --> 05:57.000
Sir.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.625
I beg you a small favor.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.042
In his dying breath...

06:05.792 --> 06:09.959
my father told me never to sell...

06:10.167 --> 06:12.959
this poetry or something.

06:13.125 --> 06:17.792
But since I can't read, I dunno what it says.

06:17.959 --> 06:23.792
I'd be in your debt if you could take a look.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.042
All right.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.375
Tang Yin was a Chinese scholar,
painter, and poet during the Ming Dynasty.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.667
It's... none other than Tang Yin.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.125
Are you sure?

06:38.125 --> 06:41.875
I've travelled to China
since childhood with my grandfather.

06:42.042 --> 06:46.709
I'm a third generation trader so I can tell.

06:46.834 --> 06:49.334
This is genuine.

06:53.709 --> 06:56.875
Tang Yin's poetry for a mere bowl of soup,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.667
good fortune did come!

07:02.500 --> 07:05.584
Bring out the good wine for the governor.

07:06.042 --> 07:09.709
Also prepare some food for the pallbearers.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.084
Yes, sir.

07:28.042 --> 07:31.750
We mustn't drink while we're on duty.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.417
You know how uptight this place is,

07:35.042 --> 07:38.542
it's all from the top, so set your worries aside.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.417
To give you some more context,

07:41.584 --> 07:45.917
it's said that Tang is
more valuable than the Forbidden City.

07:45.917 --> 07:47.709
This telescope is worthless by comparison...

07:47.709 --> 07:50.542
- The value of this...
- Quiet!

07:50.667 --> 07:53.125
- Let's talk inside.
- Sorry, governor.

07:58.500 --> 08:04.750
I feel so dopey after just one drink.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.584
You too?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.667
What the heck?

08:13.959 --> 08:15.417
How dare you...

08:16.584 --> 08:17.959
You hag!

08:55.834 --> 08:57.792
'Ethics of Governing People'

08:58.334 --> 09:01.125
Found a good passage in the preface.

09:04.292 --> 09:07.792
Today, those who serve the people,

09:08.459 --> 09:14.209
serve only their own interests,
and do not fulfill their duty.

09:15.084 --> 09:22.000
While hunger and disease
are a way of life for the people.

09:23.125 --> 09:30.500
Civil servants are stuffing themselves
with food, silk, and jewels.

09:32.042 --> 09:33.834
Isn't this shameful?

09:39.792 --> 09:41.209
Isn't it indeed.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.834
Stop this madman!

09:47.000 --> 09:52.042
Who dares to stop
the captain of Mt. Jiri's Chusul clan?

10:02.417 --> 10:04.375
Here they come.

10:04.542 --> 10:08.709
Hurry up, get your weapon!

10:22.042 --> 10:25.875
- You bitch!
- Stop right there!

11:36.292 --> 11:39.959
I will now clearly recite your crimes.

11:40.084 --> 11:41.292
No need for excuses.

11:43.084 --> 11:46.500
The crimes of governor Choi are as follows!

11:46.792 --> 11:47.959
One!

11:48.084 --> 11:52.125
Stealing from the poor rather than serving them!

11:52.459 --> 11:53.625
Two!

11:53.917 --> 11:57.959
Forced labor without any pay!

11:58.292 --> 11:59.459
Three!

12:00.084 --> 12:03.834
Neglecting civic duties and
wasting tax payers' money

12:04.000 --> 12:07.167
for personal gain, and so forth.

12:10.834 --> 12:17.500
On behalf of the populace, we, the Chusul clan,

12:17.667 --> 12:20.167
sentence you to death!

12:21.500 --> 12:22.959
The compassion of Buddha.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.667
Stop it!

12:27.042 --> 12:28.584
It's mine! Mine!

12:56.875 --> 12:59.042

KUNDO

13:52.167 --> 13:53.084
Ouch!

13:53.084 --> 13:55.250
Hurts, huh?

13:55.250 --> 13:58.209
It's supposed to hurt.

13:58.917 --> 14:01.209
Ow! Ouch!

14:01.375 --> 14:04.792
It's okay, you won't die.

14:05.792 --> 14:07.334
Look closely.

14:07.584 --> 14:11.209
My brother is only 18 years old.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.625
Not much older than y'all.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.750
Wow!

14:23.750 --> 14:25.042
You see?

14:25.209 --> 14:28.667
Not even a flinch. But that's not all.

14:31.625 --> 14:32.500
Ow!

14:32.500 --> 14:35.042
Don't be a baby.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.959
You're far from being a man!

14:38.375 --> 14:40.792
Just watch now.

14:50.834 --> 14:54.875
Wow!

14:55.750 --> 15:00.584
He was also a weakling at your age.

15:00.792 --> 15:05.084
But after eating this,

15:05.209 --> 15:09.334
he became a strong man.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.167
Here, here.

15:11.334 --> 15:14.334
Take it, here.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.042
Y'all got it? Now, your turn.

15:19.334 --> 15:21.167
Great.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.417
So big!

15:29.042 --> 15:30.834
Why's your hand empty?

15:30.917 --> 15:33.542
Nuthin' at my house.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.875
Not even rat turds.

15:36.042 --> 15:37.875
What's this bullshit?

15:38.084 --> 15:41.709
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

15:42.125 --> 15:45.625
Go steal your mum's undies if you have to.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.042
Go on.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.709
That's everything?

16:04.375 --> 16:08.417
During the Joseon era, butchers
were considered the lowest social class.

16:08.417 --> 16:12.334
They were no better than slaves.

16:14.209 --> 16:17.125
Dolmuchi, the butcher

16:33.292 --> 16:37.917
Act 2: The March of the Dead

16:44.417 --> 16:48.125
Jo Yoon

16:48.125 --> 16:49.959
Jo Yoon, son of Naju noble Jo Won-suk,

16:49.959 --> 16:52.834
was a natural born martial artist,

16:53.042 --> 16:56.917
who passed high-level military exams

16:57.000 --> 17:00.292
at the tender age of 19,

17:00.459 --> 17:04.500
and was promoted to captain at 21.

17:04.791 --> 17:09.459
His combat prowess was next to none.

17:10.041 --> 17:13.791
He had mastered military tactics

17:13.875 --> 17:16.625
and various weapons early on.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.459
His fists smashed rocks,

17:18.459 --> 17:21.166
his spear pierced flying birds,

17:21.375 --> 17:24.291
and his sword sliced the light

17:24.791 --> 17:29.334
and made rainbows.

17:29.834 --> 17:35.667
He was a force to be reckoned with,
to say the least.

17:38.500 --> 17:44.459
Born to a Naju courtesan in a brothel,

17:44.834 --> 17:50.834
he was destined for greatness or affliction,

17:51.042 --> 17:57.834
depending on which family he was born to.

17:59.959 --> 18:05.709
He was raised by courtesans since his birth,

18:06.709 --> 18:12.167
and finally met his father at the age of 8.

18:17.667 --> 18:23.625
For a man of such stature,
you mustn't be so frugal.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.459
I knew you weren't an ordinary woman,

18:28.334 --> 18:33.209
but bargaining for the life of your own son?

18:33.750 --> 18:36.334
What a natural huckster.

18:39.375 --> 18:45.334
His father was Lord Jo Won-suk,
a corrupt former governor

18:45.417 --> 18:49.542
of Jeola province, who built his fortune

18:49.709 --> 18:51.959
by exploiting his citizens.

18:58.084 --> 19:04.584
Lady Jo, who only had 4 girls,
was threatened by the appearance of

19:04.709 --> 19:08.042
Lord Jo's illegitimate son,

19:09.709 --> 19:14.250
but Lord Jo only cared that
he now had a bright heir

19:14.250 --> 19:18.167
to continue his distinguished family name.

19:18.459 --> 19:20.125
Builds an upright character.

19:20.584 --> 19:22.417
Very good.

19:22.584 --> 19:30.625
But Lady Jo was a woman of
far stronger will than he thought.

19:32.875 --> 19:36.084
In order to conceive a boy

19:38.417 --> 19:41.959
she challenged herself to no end...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.667
What's gotten into you?

19:45.792 --> 19:47.334
- Honey...
- Let's do it another time.

19:47.334 --> 19:49.375
Let go of your pants.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.500
And defying all biological limitations...

19:51.500 --> 19:54.875
She finally achieved her goal at the age of 40.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.334
It's a boy!

20:00.792 --> 20:03.834
Thanks to his new half brother,

20:03.834 --> 20:09.250
Jo Yoon instantly became
Ugly duckling of the family,

20:09.375 --> 20:13.542
who felt the cruelty of life early on,

20:13.667 --> 20:15.792
and his feelings turned

20:16.959 --> 20:21.000
into anger and hostility.

20:26.125 --> 20:30.542
If you ever do it again,
you'll go back to the whorehouse!

20:30.667 --> 20:35.334
He endured the nightmare that was his childhood.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.375
Su-in for sale!

20:38.375 --> 20:40.209
He's cheap!

20:41.459 --> 20:48.750
Jo Yoon finally decided to face his anger head on.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.750
Mother...

21:36.250 --> 21:37.375
You ungrateful bastard!

21:37.375 --> 21:39.792
How dare you?

21:39.792 --> 21:45.500
Lady Jo didn't think the boy
could've planned it alone,

21:45.834 --> 21:49.750
and took his mother's life instead,

21:50.875 --> 21:58.250
in addition to his attendant's
leg for good measure.

22:05.042 --> 22:08.209
Think about what you've done.

22:10.875 --> 22:14.417
For a tender boy of 11,

22:14.709 --> 22:19.542
darkness was far too harsh a punishment.

22:20.292 --> 22:26.417
Having heard of his brother's death at
the governor's 60th birthday party,

22:26.625 --> 22:33.292
Jo Yoon left his post and
returned home after 10 years.

22:35.959 --> 22:42.417
From the shock of her son's death,
Lady Jo also departed this world.

22:42.792 --> 22:46.084
Now only Lord Jo and his son Jo Yoon

22:46.209 --> 22:51.625
bear the family name.

22:53.334 --> 22:54.625
However...

22:55.167 --> 22:58.500
The funerals must've taken a toll on you.

22:59.167 --> 23:01.292
Please eat something.

23:01.875 --> 23:05.459
I don't want any, take it away.

23:05.584 --> 23:10.667
You must get back on
your feet and lead our family.

23:10.875 --> 23:14.375
Mother and Su-in are at peace now.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.542
The living must go on.

23:20.459 --> 23:22.834
I'll leave you be, father.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.834
240 kg of meat and 150 kg of organs.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.000
Not so much this time.

23:40.167 --> 23:42.167
Hope you're not cheating us.

23:42.500 --> 23:47.042
We'll weigh it later, don't mess around.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.375
Here.

23:53.375 --> 23:55.084
What the hell?

23:55.334 --> 23:57.042
It's not enough?

24:00.625 --> 24:03.750
Dolmuchi, a moment?

24:06.375 --> 24:08.209
So hot...

24:09.542 --> 24:15.250
Making a living in this world ain't so easy.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.875
Anyway...

24:18.292 --> 24:23.125
There's... something that's bothering me.

24:24.459 --> 24:28.667
Interested in a big score?

24:35.417 --> 24:37.250
Wait here.

24:45.584 --> 24:46.792
Master.

24:47.625 --> 24:48.792
Come in.

24:59.292 --> 25:03.417
Master, it's... an honor to meet you.

25:03.584 --> 25:06.459
Are you the butcher who serves my house?

25:06.625 --> 25:08.459
I am indeed, sir!

25:08.625 --> 25:11.625
I'm always grateful of your...

25:11.625 --> 25:13.459
How do you like your job?

25:13.959 --> 25:19.125
Even livestock are living, breathing creatures,

25:19.292 --> 25:21.125
can't be easy to kill.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.459
No, sir, not at all!

25:24.834 --> 25:28.834
I can kill hundreds every day
If you'll give me the job.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.459
You don't feel guilty?

25:32.459 --> 25:37.000
I hear you can't do it
if you see its eyes right before.

25:37.167 --> 25:41.959
That has never happened to me, master.

25:42.292 --> 25:45.125
But I do try to kill it with one blow.

25:45.459 --> 25:47.625
Animals do feel pain, after all.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.000
I see.

25:49.917 --> 25:52.500
Great to see such dedication.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.167
Just one more question.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.334
Have you...

26:04.959 --> 26:06.834
only killed animals?

26:32.209 --> 26:34.084
You're back!

26:34.667 --> 26:36.042
Good job!

26:38.042 --> 26:42.292
Wow, what's all this? Fell from the sky?

26:42.875 --> 26:46.334
- Eat slowly.
- Did you eat?

26:46.375 --> 26:48.709
I already had plenty.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.500
Mum, I'm back!

26:52.459 --> 26:54.709
Mum, look at this!

26:54.875 --> 26:56.375
It's a feast!

26:56.459 --> 26:58.542
What's going on?

27:01.292 --> 27:03.042
What's all this?

27:03.459 --> 27:04.709
Our bellies will explode.

27:04.709 --> 27:06.625
Where did you get these?

27:42.917 --> 27:47.417
Halfway up Mt. Dongak, there is a small temple.

27:48.250 --> 27:52.625
You'll find a delicate looking girl there.

27:54.250 --> 27:58.709
20 in silver will be enough to
open a tavern anywhere.

27:59.459 --> 28:04.875
It's your chance to live like a king.

28:05.042 --> 28:07.917
This is a silly question, but...

28:08.459 --> 28:11.209
what should I do with the girl?

28:11.834 --> 28:13.542
Make her disappear.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.042
Like she never existed.

28:17.584 --> 28:19.292
I'm supposed to do what?

28:19.792 --> 28:23.209
Just think of her as one of your livestock.

28:23.792 --> 28:27.167
She went there to mourn her husband's death,

28:27.792 --> 28:30.459
but fooled around with the monks.

28:32.792 --> 28:35.459
She's no better than a pig.

30:32.167 --> 30:34.500
Who... are you?

30:39.584 --> 30:43.292
Is anyone out there? Help!

30:53.292 --> 30:54.459
What the hell?

30:55.667 --> 30:56.709
Damn you!

31:15.917 --> 31:17.792
You fool.

31:18.125 --> 31:20.167
Trying to take a life for a petty sum?

31:20.167 --> 31:24.959
She's a dirty whore who
fooled around with monks.

31:25.042 --> 31:26.584
You stay out of this!

31:26.584 --> 31:28.000
'Fooled around'?

31:28.334 --> 31:30.250
Who fooled around with whom?

31:30.334 --> 31:34.209
I may just be a butcher,
but I know how the world works!

31:51.500 --> 31:53.875
Dolmuchi! How did it go?

31:54.000 --> 31:57.584
I've been waiting without toilet breaks.

31:58.542 --> 32:03.375
Don't stand there like an idiot,
tell me what happened!

32:04.000 --> 32:05.209
What the...?

32:05.709 --> 32:08.959
Why's your face covered in bruises?

32:10.542 --> 32:13.084
It's... I...

32:14.292 --> 32:16.875
It didn't feel right...

32:17.417 --> 32:19.375
I just couldn't do it.

32:22.250 --> 32:24.542
Go tell him I'm sorry for me, all right?

32:27.709 --> 32:29.125
Hey, Dolmuchi!

32:29.292 --> 32:30.417
Hey!

32:30.542 --> 32:31.875
That bastard...

32:34.042 --> 32:36.500
That wicked bitch must've sensed it.

32:37.417 --> 32:43.084
When the butcher got there, she was already gone.

32:43.875 --> 32:48.084
How far can a pregnant girl go?

32:48.750 --> 32:53.084
Our people are on it. We'll find her soon.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.667
Please forgive me, master!

33:04.250 --> 33:09.250
It won't... happen again!

33:12.500 --> 33:16.250
Mum, you know what,

33:16.959 --> 33:23.167
maybe I should go
join the bandits in the mountains.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.750
What are you yapping on about?

33:27.250 --> 33:30.959
Thieves don't go to heaven.

33:30.959 --> 33:34.459
You don't know how the world works now.

33:34.584 --> 33:36.000
There's a saying,

33:36.125 --> 33:39.834
'united, you are thieves,
divided, you are people.'

33:40.125 --> 33:44.292
Everyone in this country is a thief of some kind.

33:44.459 --> 33:46.500
Why not us, too?

33:46.625 --> 33:49.750
He's right about that.

33:49.875 --> 33:54.250
We cannot survive just by being good.

33:55.167 --> 33:59.209
The bandit base is in Mt. Jiri,

33:59.542 --> 34:01.500
I heard it's heaven on earth.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.000
Have you all gone mad?

34:04.125 --> 34:06.625
No matter how bad things get,

34:06.625 --> 34:09.458
you gotta play the hand you're dealt.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.625
Your late father always said,

34:12.750 --> 34:14.708
'know your place in life.'

34:14.875 --> 34:17.917
Dolmuchi, are you home?

34:21.833 --> 34:23.500
What brings you here so late?

34:26.458 --> 34:27.500
Who are you?

34:27.500 --> 34:28.833
What's going on?

34:33.875 --> 34:35.542
What are you doing?

34:35.750 --> 34:38.000
Please stop!

34:38.000 --> 34:39.833
Raise him up!

34:42.458 --> 34:44.708
You incompetent bastard!

34:45.375 --> 34:47.208
That bitch in the temple,

34:47.500 --> 34:50.542
where is she now?

34:50.792 --> 34:53.875
I dunno, how could I know that?

34:53.875 --> 34:55.083
Son!

34:55.250 --> 34:57.042
Mother!

35:31.584 --> 35:33.209
He's awake!

35:33.417 --> 35:35.417
Knock that bastard out!

35:50.334 --> 35:51.834
Come out!

35:57.584 --> 35:59.084
Son of a bitch!

35:59.584 --> 36:00.959
Die already!

36:09.584 --> 36:11.084
Tenacious bastard!

36:59.834 --> 37:01.334
Probably dead?

37:01.334 --> 37:02.834
Let's leave!

37:47.834 --> 37:49.209
It can't be...

38:00.584 --> 38:01.875
Mum...

38:03.750 --> 38:05.250
Open your eyes.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.709
Mum.

38:07.959 --> 38:09.667
Please wake up.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.375
Mum...

38:14.542 --> 38:17.875
Gok-ji, wake up!

38:18.834 --> 38:22.417
Sis, please open your eyes.

38:26.667 --> 38:27.917
No...

38:39.084 --> 38:40.250
Mum...

38:43.375 --> 38:44.750
Gok-ji...

39:08.000 --> 39:09.792
How dare he show up here?

39:18.167 --> 39:20.459
How is he still alive?

39:20.875 --> 39:23.625
Go stop that bastard! Stop him!

39:24.584 --> 39:27.084
Buddy, we were just following our orders.

39:28.459 --> 39:29.792
Please!

39:35.167 --> 39:37.500
You didn't have to go so far!

39:40.792 --> 39:42.459
Someone bring the police!

40:01.209 --> 40:03.834
Who is disturbing the wake?

40:04.334 --> 40:05.500
Who the fuck?

40:06.459 --> 40:07.792
Who might you be?

40:08.375 --> 40:12.375
Oh, it's you!

40:13.000 --> 40:15.209
You ordered my family killed.

42:30.875 --> 42:34.209
Executions cannot be carried out
without due process,

42:34.334 --> 42:36.417
you know that.

42:36.542 --> 42:42.625
A humble butcher doesn't
go on a rampage without a motive.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.584
See yourself out.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Butchers are the descendants of barbarians,

42:52.167 --> 42:55.667
they're known to commit serious crimes.

42:56.334 --> 43:01.334
Why do those brutes need a reason for anything?

43:02.875 --> 43:06.000
Your sister-in-law disappeared

43:06.500 --> 43:11.750
a day after your brother's death.
No reason for that, either?

43:11.875 --> 43:15.709
It's not proper for
a pregnant woman to attend a funeral,

43:15.875 --> 43:18.292
so she was sent to temple.

43:18.417 --> 43:19.709
But,

43:21.625 --> 43:25.667
your men are out searching for her,

43:26.209 --> 43:27.542
why is that?

43:33.375 --> 43:36.584
I don't know if the baby is a boy or girl,

43:36.834 --> 43:38.750
but if she vanishes,

43:38.875 --> 43:42.209
you would become the sole heir.

43:47.292 --> 43:52.375
Should we believe this is all just a coincidence?

43:53.125 --> 43:56.917
I believe it's somehow related

43:57.084 --> 43:59.584
to the butcher's rampage.

44:11.125 --> 44:12.584
Please open it.

44:20.084 --> 44:24.084
Master Jo, are you ridiculing me?

44:24.250 --> 44:26.750
What should I fill it in With?

44:28.125 --> 44:30.584
Gold, jewels, or money,

44:31.167 --> 44:33.917
I'll fill it with whatever you desire.

44:46.042 --> 44:48.625
He will be executed right away,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.875
won't need to worry anymore.

45:42.709 --> 45:44.500
Kneel, prisoner!

46:05.167 --> 46:06.709
What the hell?

46:55.917 --> 46:59.417
We were sent by Master Jo.

47:00.459 --> 47:03.125
We're here to offer you a chance to live.

47:03.959 --> 47:08.959
He wishes you to finish the job. What say you?

47:09.125 --> 47:13.417
Will you find the bitch and
kill her or die right here?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.084
I asked you a question!

47:24.959 --> 47:27.667
If you intend to kill me, then do it.

47:28.500 --> 47:32.959
But give Jo my fucking message.

47:34.334 --> 47:40.459
I'll come back as a ghost and have my revenge.

47:45.875 --> 47:49.792
He looks like a fiend, but speaks the truth.

47:50.292 --> 47:55.000
Hope you get your wish.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.209
What the...

48:00.584 --> 48:01.625
Do it right.

48:01.625 --> 48:05.000
Wait, I didn't hit him hard enough.

48:09.375 --> 48:11.750
There you go.

48:11.959 --> 48:13.959
His head's rock hard.

48:44.375 --> 48:47.000
Look here!

48:47.542 --> 48:52.084
Go prepare a feast for our distinguished guest!

48:52.250 --> 48:56.375
Who the fuck does he think he is?

48:56.542 --> 48:58.125
Do it yourself.

48:58.917 --> 49:01.959
Listen to the filth from that mouth of hers.

49:02.209 --> 49:03.875
Doesn't even rise in greeting.

49:04.042 --> 49:07.042
Watch your mouth when addressing a noble!

49:07.292 --> 49:08.709
You watch it!

49:11.375 --> 49:12.959
So great to see you.

49:16.792 --> 49:17.875
Look at this.

49:19.959 --> 49:23.875
This is extremely rare and expensive,

49:24.375 --> 49:26.459
I brought it just for you.

49:26.917 --> 49:28.417
Keep it.

49:35.750 --> 49:39.250
If someone gives you a gift, you should thank him,

49:39.250 --> 49:41.250
or you know...

49:44.084 --> 49:45.917
What the fuck was that?

49:46.584 --> 49:49.917
Life isn't just about surviving,

49:50.084 --> 49:52.042
we love and stuff too...

49:54.750 --> 49:56.334
Cut the shit!

49:56.542 --> 49:59.459
Look at this fat pig in heat.

49:59.625 --> 50:03.417
Go wash yourself for once.

50:03.584 --> 50:06.584
You smell like rotting fertilizer.

50:07.667 --> 50:09.000
Wait!

50:09.250 --> 50:12.459
Look here, I got another!

50:21.167 --> 50:23.334
So he's the one?

50:36.792 --> 50:37.959
Water...

50:58.834 --> 51:00.209
Hey idiot!

51:00.375 --> 51:02.542
Don't drink the whole river!

51:02.834 --> 51:05.000
Didn't you have a death wish?

51:05.167 --> 51:07.000
Gonna drink to death?

51:36.000 --> 51:38.875
Come, if you want to live like a man.

53:16.584 --> 53:20.667
Act 3: A New World

53:22.250 --> 53:24.667
Have you been well?

53:25.209 --> 53:27.125
Who is that girl?

53:27.792 --> 53:29.292
Mind your business.

53:29.459 --> 53:31.125
Daddy!

53:31.625 --> 53:34.792
What took you so long? We've been waiting.

53:34.875 --> 53:36.792
Are you hungry?

53:38.334 --> 53:39.875
Give her a hand.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.375
Are you okay?

53:54.709 --> 53:56.500
Who the fuck is that?

53:56.625 --> 53:57.834
Who the fuck?

53:57.834 --> 53:59.792
Brats! Go play over there!

53:59.917 --> 54:01.000
Goddamned little buggers.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.709
Fuck you! No flat-chested
bitch tells us what to do!

54:04.834 --> 54:06.500
Flat-chested bitch!

54:07.834 --> 54:09.084
You little bastards!

54:09.167 --> 54:11.167
Stop right there!

54:11.167 --> 54:13.167
- Fuck you!
- I'll crack your head!

54:13.334 --> 54:14.834
Fatten your titties first!

54:18.667 --> 54:26.584
This is how 18-year old Dolmuchi
came to join the Chusul clan in Mt. Jiri.

54:27.292 --> 54:31.792
As one of the oldest clans in Joseon,

54:31.917 --> 54:39.750
they're proud of the outlaw heritage
that sides with the weak.

54:40.750 --> 54:45.292
Comprised of those shunned
and rejected by society,

54:45.500 --> 54:49.125
they despised greed and unfair authority,

54:50.375 --> 54:54.417
loathed those who
favored social status over ability...

54:54.417 --> 54:55.542
Perfect!

54:57.959 --> 55:04.584
And disdained those who
valued the dead more than the living.

55:05.084 --> 55:07.459
He must've been rich, eh?

55:09.917 --> 55:15.750
But not all who shunned
the world could join the clan.

55:16.417 --> 55:22.250
One had to be chosen.

55:24.500 --> 55:29.959
Just one recommendation
was allowed per branch annually,

55:29.959 --> 55:32.709
and the captain made the final call.

55:33.459 --> 55:40.917
But as with all rules, exceptions were made.

55:41.459 --> 55:45.000
For the final candidate to become a member,

55:45.125 --> 55:48.125
he had to meet three conditions.

55:48.459 --> 55:52.625
First, his eyes had to be clear.

55:53.459 --> 55:57.084
Second, he must possess a strong will.

55:57.542 --> 56:02.792
And third, distinction was mandatory.

56:06.250 --> 56:07.834
We are all

56:08.542 --> 56:10.750
descendants of our forefather Dankun,

56:11.459 --> 56:17.292
and as such, we are all brothers and sisters.

56:17.667 --> 56:19.375
But at some point,

56:19.959 --> 56:23.459
the strong began to oppress the weak,

56:24.042 --> 56:27.917
and the rich stole from the poor,

56:28.125 --> 56:32.375
thereby ending our sacred brotherhood.

56:33.042 --> 56:37.792
We will right the wrongs in this world,
you and me!

56:38.959 --> 56:42.667
We will give the poor what we take from the rich,

56:43.167 --> 56:46.709
fight alongside the weak,

56:47.375 --> 56:52.709
and rebuild the brotherhood!

57:11.917 --> 57:18.375
Do you believe that we can build this new world?

57:24.917 --> 57:26.209
Yes.

57:26.542 --> 57:31.375
Do you believe that the souls of
the oppressed stand by us?

57:31.542 --> 57:34.209
Mum, please wake up.

57:34.292 --> 57:37.875
Sis, please open your eyes.

57:41.667 --> 57:42.834
Yes.

57:43.042 --> 57:47.417
Will you join us in accomplishing our work?

57:54.250 --> 57:55.459
Yes.

57:55.667 --> 58:02.292
Heaven and earth bear witness,

58:02.750 --> 58:04.750
you are now one of us.

58:06.334 --> 58:07.667
Get up.

58:19.750 --> 58:22.917
Your name is now 'Dochi'.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.500
It means 'inversion..

58:27.375 --> 58:30.959
No matter how smart and able you are,

58:31.292 --> 58:35.084
one mustn't trade benevolence for anything.

58:37.084 --> 58:39.667
Even if you lack the smarts,

58:42.792 --> 58:44.334
be a good person.

58:45.209 --> 58:46.375
Yes.

58:51.292 --> 58:53.334
No sucker punch this time. C'mere!

58:54.334 --> 58:57.292
Great to have you.

58:58.209 --> 59:00.834
Let's welcome him.

59:02.667 --> 59:04.375
You came a long way!

59:04.375 --> 59:05.959
Live a worthy life.

59:06.167 --> 59:08.000
He looks tough enough.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.209
I kinda like him now.

59:25.709 --> 59:27.834
Halt!

59:42.875 --> 59:44.125
What happened here?

59:44.209 --> 59:46.000
We were... ambushed...

59:46.459 --> 59:47.417
by bandits...

59:47.417 --> 59:51.459
When did it happen? Where did they go?

59:52.250 --> 59:55.917
There...

01:00:01.334 --> 01:00:04.167
All the horsemen will go after the bandits,

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.417
and the rest guard the tributes!

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:08.125
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:27.792
I can't feel my face.

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:29.875
My balls...

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:32.250
So friggin' cold!

01:00:36.084 --> 01:00:37.667
Get up! Hurry!

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.917
Buddy! Get the hell up.

01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:47.000
Well now, I fell asleep.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.625
You fat pig,

01:00:48.959 --> 01:00:51.334
how can you snore while on the job?

01:00:51.334 --> 01:00:53.959
The ground was nice and comfy.

01:00:54.167 --> 01:00:56.209
Nice day for a hunt, ain't it?

01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:58.125
Come on down!

01:00:58.375 --> 01:00:59.542
Be careful.

01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:00.875
Come down slowly.

01:01:05.459 --> 01:01:06.334
Look at me being cute.

01:01:06.334 --> 01:01:08.042
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:01:08.834 --> 01:01:12.334
Was it hard coming down? Lose some weight.

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:14.459
I was... tripped!

01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:19.959
Yo, baldy. This isn't your bed.

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:23.459
Wake up kid, all the elders are up.

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:17.209
Bud, just chill.

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:19.792
I'm a walking shitstorm.

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:30.125
Holy shit...

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:35.917
I apologize if I offend you,

01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:39.875
but even a mutt will laugh at your puny dick.

01:02:40.709 --> 01:02:42.709
I feel terrible.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:50.334
I dunno why you're taking the long way around.

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:58.000
Why don't you two unload the litter?

01:02:58.209 --> 01:03:00.792
I ache all over.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.167
Did you hear me? Unload them!

01:03:04.334 --> 01:03:07.334
Are you deaf? She's got aches!

01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:10.750
My dear Ma-hyang's talking!

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:12.959
Right?

01:03:13.334 --> 01:03:15.292
What? What do you want?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.292
I took a bath today.

01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:22.500
They're just cannon fodder,

01:03:22.667 --> 01:03:24.250
no need to show off your strength.

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.750
Let's unload!

01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:28.000
I won't kill you, don't you worry.

01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:34.125
Topknot is my inheritance!

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:36.167
I'd rather...

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.042
...die!

01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:40.542
Death wish?

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.459
That's not very honorable.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.209
By any chance,

01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:53.042
are you Mt. Jiri's...

01:03:53.209 --> 01:03:55.375
Do... Dochi?

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.375
Dochi

01:04:56.834 --> 01:05:01.209
It's been two years since Dochi was reborn.

01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:02.959
Push a little more!

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:11.292
It's a boy!

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:14.209
Absorbing the life force of a newborn,

01:05:14.334 --> 01:05:17.584
he has let go of his tragic past,

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:21.792
and became an indispensable figure.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.417
But growth and pain go hand-in-hand.

01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:32.709
Witnessing the death of Jung-sim at childbirth,

01:05:32.792 --> 01:05:37.625
who married Jo Su-in as a bartered bride at 14,

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:41.834
left an unforgettable scar on Dochi's mind,

01:05:41.959 --> 01:05:47.250
just like the burn on his head.

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:04.125
For attempting to take a life for pay,

01:06:04.292 --> 01:06:06.125
you lost your family.

01:06:06.459 --> 01:06:08.084
Us butchers...

01:06:08.334 --> 01:06:12.000
we're destined to slaughter,

01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:15.000
and follow orders.

01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:18.125
My family's deaths aren't my fault!

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:20.875
It's not your fault?

01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:26.542
The servants you killed at the wake,
how did they deserve that fate?

01:06:26.834 --> 01:06:29.292
The act of killing should only be allowed

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:33.875
as a last resort to saving the people from harm.

01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:38.042
Innocent lives were lost for your personal greed!

01:06:38.209 --> 01:06:40.959
No, of course not!

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:43.542
That wasn't my fault!

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:49.459
Everything in life is interconnected,
like a spider's web.

01:06:49.542 --> 01:06:51.500
It's no one's fault.

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:57.542
Free yourself from the restraints surrounding you.

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:01.750
Cut and eliminate

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.167
the source of your inner torment.

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:29.250
After two years of training patiently,

01:07:29.792 --> 01:07:32.750
Dochi became infamous,

01:07:32.834 --> 01:07:37.334
whose name sent chills down the nobles' spines.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.250
In Joseon society,

01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:45.292
all body hair had to be groomed,
a custom of their forefathers.

01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:49.959
The act of cutting off a topknot,
a symbol of masculinity,

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:55.125
Challenged the fundamental
social values of society.

01:07:55.417 --> 01:07:56.625
But for him,

01:07:56.792 --> 01:08:01.292
it was nothing but a fun new hobby.

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:06.417
Mother!

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:11.292
People believed Dochi was
a descendant of barbarians

01:08:11.459 --> 01:08:14.834
due to his hairstyle, or lack thereof.

01:08:14.959 --> 01:08:19.084
It made him notorious.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.292
- Flawless!
- Amazing!

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.167
Master.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:56.209
Two years since Dochi's rebirth,

01:08:56.417 --> 01:09:01.167
Jo Yoon's wealth and
power outgrew that of his father,

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:07.167
thanks to full support of the new governor.

01:09:08.334 --> 01:09:14.500
Historians regard this as
the first private-public enterprise.

01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:20.959
On a bad-crop year,
the government issued relief rice,

01:09:21.209 --> 01:09:27.167
which had to be repaid with
interest in the following harvest.

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:29.375
Nice and heavy!

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.000
The relief rice was mixed with bran or sand,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.042
or soaked with water to increase its weight.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:43.875
But the repayment was only in rice.

01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:51.542
Jo easily obtained the records of people
who couldn't repay.

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:56.250
Joseon was known to value the pen over the sword,

01:09:56.750 --> 01:10:02.209
but over-reliance on wealth would be its downfall.

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:10.167
As Jo obtained the records,

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:14.125
the local office sent out officers

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:17.417
to those who couldn't repay,

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:26.084
and harassed the citizens mercilessly.

01:10:26.542 --> 01:10:28.750
You can't demand repayment so suddenly!

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:31.209
Let go! Worthless trash!

01:10:31.209 --> 01:10:32.542
Grab him!

01:10:33.542 --> 01:10:37.459
After the storm swept through...

01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:41.459
Why don't I ask my master for help?

01:10:41.584 --> 01:10:43.750
Jo loaned rice without interest

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:47.584
if they gave land papers as collateral.

01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:50.750
Take your time paying it back.

01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:54.792
Thank you, thank you so much, sir!

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.542
He's our savior!

01:10:58.667 --> 01:10:59.959
Heaven sent him to us!

01:10:59.959 --> 01:11:04.125
The illiterate people drew a line on their IOU's

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:07.959
without understanding the terms.

01:11:08.459 --> 01:11:14.792
These Signatures' would
play a crucial role later.

01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:20.375
One year later...

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:23.167
Have you been well, sir?

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:28.167
Thanks for coming so far.

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:33.334
It is my time to pay you all back.

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:35.625
How long has it been?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.667
Your days of hardship are over.

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:44.000
As the country was going through
a financial crisis,

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:49.959
the officers haven't been
paid for several years...

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:55.959
Buddy, what are you doing on my land?

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.375
So they repaid his altruism
with absolute obediance.

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:02.709
It's my land now!

01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:04.209
Understand?

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:05.834
How is this fair?

01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:11.250
Having lost their land overnight,
they went to the governor

01:12:11.375 --> 01:12:14.792
to report the unjust...

01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:16.542
Punish those sons of bitches!

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:17.917
One!

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.209
Two!

01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:28.875
Over the span of a year, they lost their lands,

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:34.750
and became slaves of Lord Jo,
as their IOU's stated.

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:39.542
Jo Yoon soon became the owner of

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:43.417
over 20 km, or half of Naju land.

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:48.042
The citizens began calling him 'the land demon..

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.375
These are new property documents that I acquired.

01:12:56.750 --> 01:13:00.667
They're all under your name,
please have a look.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.459
Father.

01:13:07.667 --> 01:13:11.375
It's been two years since Su-in passed away.

01:13:11.584 --> 01:13:14.125
For our family's future,

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:17.959
I believe its time to appoint the new family heir.

01:13:18.459 --> 01:13:20.750
What do you think?

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:22.792
Any news...

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:25.542
of Su-in's wife?

01:13:28.667 --> 01:13:33.292
She fled with another man over two years ago.

01:13:35.959 --> 01:13:39.125
Why do you keep asking for her?

01:13:39.209 --> 01:13:43.709
Are you really asking me for a reason?

01:13:44.459 --> 01:13:48.375
You really think I don't know what you've done?

01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:53.250
Pardon me for saying so,

01:13:55.167 --> 01:13:58.125
I heard that delusions and suspicions

01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:02.834
might drive you to an early grave.

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:10.417
For your health's sake, please give up false hope.

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:22.209
You worthless bastards!

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:26.459
Plow the entire length!

01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:29.792
Get the fuck up and get to work!

01:14:34.334 --> 01:14:35.750
Over here!

01:14:36.084 --> 01:14:37.250
Get up!

01:14:42.834 --> 01:14:44.834
We were just passing by,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.750
may this humble monk ask you a few questions?

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:53.334
This might sound silly,

01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:57.500
this land is too salty to cultivate anything,

01:14:57.875 --> 01:15:00.042
why do you work the field?

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:03.000
I just feel like it.

01:15:03.334 --> 01:15:06.125
Even if it's useless,

01:15:06.209 --> 01:15:09.000
it's better than letting it waste away.

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:22.042
At times... it is wiser to let things be.

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:28.792
Your faith must've led you

01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:32.250
to take too much interest in other's affairs.

01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:36.167
I'll take your words into consideration.

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:56.875
Act 4: Save the People

01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:59.584
That motherfucker!

01:15:59.584 --> 01:16:02.917
For someone who once held public office,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.584
how could he be so merciless?

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:07.042
Those who've tasted money thirst for more,

01:16:07.042 --> 01:16:09.917
and public officials are the worst.

01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:12.542
A beatdown will do.

01:16:12.542 --> 01:16:17.125
In addition, with Jo Yoon's full support,

01:16:17.292 --> 01:16:21.000
his seven henchmen gamble and act as loan sharks,

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:27.125
increasing the pain and suffering of the poor.

01:16:35.292 --> 01:16:39.459
I have also heard of his atrocities.

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:43.417
His combat skills are without equal in Joseon,

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.625
and he can easily defeat ten men all by himself.

01:16:47.834 --> 01:16:52.125
But as a bastard, he couldn't attain a high rank.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:56.792
He has the power of steel in him.

01:16:56.917 --> 01:17:00.167
Born in the year of tiger,

01:17:00.334 --> 01:17:04.500
he's fated to become a powerful leader,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.709
but the evil energy surrounding
his soul will lead him...

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:11.959
To have blood on his hands all his life!

01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:16.792
We gotta slap his fate
into place and set him straight.

01:17:16.792 --> 01:17:19.167
So, what do you want to do?

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.417
Do we hit him or not?

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:26.292
He's got the martial arts chops,
and fate is on his side -

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:29.250
he ain't an easy target.

01:17:29.417 --> 01:17:30.834
I'll do it.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.375
Give me a week. I'll come back with his head.

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:42.209
Can't allow it.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.959
Your grudge can't be our motivation.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:49.709
You need to sit this one out.

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:52.292
Why?

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.167
Damn it!

01:17:54.334 --> 01:17:56.875
Fuck grudges!

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.000
Let me fucking do this!

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.792
Man, that temper!

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:07.209
Who do you think you are?

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:11.292
We treated you with respect, you little shit!

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.250
I ain't so little, you shit!

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:15.084
I'm 20 this year!

01:18:15.209 --> 01:18:19.417
Bald fuck, and I'm 22, so respect your elders!

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:21.375
Fucking little shit.

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:24.375
Look at them ignorant bastards.

01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:25.917
Boy.

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:31.417
We didn't come here to serve your agenda.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:38.084
- Sit.
- Sit down!

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.584
Watch it, buddy.

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.959
Let's do what we've always done.

01:18:49.084 --> 01:18:50.250
Let's vote.

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.959
This job cannot be done.

01:18:53.084 --> 01:18:54.709
We hit him!

01:19:12.834 --> 01:19:16.542
There are other, easier jobs.

01:19:18.292 --> 01:19:20.500
It's unanimous then.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:24.000
I was getting restless.

01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:31.667
It must be our time to hit the jackpot.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:39.500
And your time to face him.

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:43.167
Catch that thief!

01:19:43.875 --> 01:19:45.125
Stop him!

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.917
Stop right there!

01:20:03.334 --> 01:20:06.459
There is a warehouse near Youngsanpo district

01:20:06.792 --> 01:20:09.209
that stores grain to be paid as tax.

01:20:10.167 --> 01:20:14.167
Get caught while stealing the grain.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:25.959
In the meantime, you forge a courthouse seal.

01:20:26.334 --> 01:20:27.542
Why me?

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.334
Let's say I did that, then what?

01:20:30.334 --> 01:20:31.375
Small brush.

01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:35.375
One of us needs to
infiltrate the governor's office.

01:20:35.959 --> 01:20:37.125
Who?

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:41.417
People are furious at the Naju governor too,

01:20:41.584 --> 01:20:44.584
who's in league with Jo Yoon.

01:20:45.375 --> 01:20:47.417
Our ultimate goal

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:52.875
is to take back the land and the rice,
and return them to the people.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:06.834
I'm from the court of justice,
I need to see the governor.

01:21:07.334 --> 01:21:10.000
Ever heard of Lord Jo Won-suk?

01:21:10.417 --> 01:21:15.584
He's an incredibly wealthy noble,
and famous in our region.

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.709
Then what he says is true.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.542
If he's so wealthy,
he has to be bandits' prime target.

01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:24.875
Bandits?

01:21:25.042 --> 01:21:26.417
Did you know

01:21:26.542 --> 01:21:30.542
your predecessor was killed by
bandits two years ago?

01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:32.375
Yes, of course.

01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:34.834
He's one of them.

01:21:35.584 --> 01:21:39.709
After two years of investigation,
we finally caught him.

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.334
The morning is bright,

01:21:42.334 --> 01:21:43.792
meet on Spring Equinox day.

01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:46.209
After a lengthy interrogation,

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:50.459
we found out that this letter for 'morning'

01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:53.875
actually signifies Lord Jo's residence.

01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:04.959
That is quite peculiar.

01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:09.042
We intercepted this message from
a thief a few days ago.

01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:11.292
It is the same.

01:22:11.792 --> 01:22:13.667
Isn't today...

01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:17.709
the Spring Equinox?

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:20.250
You fools!

01:22:20.459 --> 01:22:22.625
You think you decoded our...

01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:26.834
According to our investigation,

01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:29.209
the ones targeting Lord Jo are

01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:31.834
bandits from Mt. Jiri and Northern province.

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:36.125
We do not yet know where the Northern bandits are.

01:22:37.334 --> 01:22:41.250
Have you heard anything?

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:45.000
Not a damn thing.

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:49.709
Since he claims to know
the base of Mt. Jiri bandits,

01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:53.500
we'll coordinate a joint assault

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.542
if you give us your men.

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:58.125
As you wish.

01:22:58.292 --> 01:23:02.542
Time's running out, we must alert Lord Jo.

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:06.500
My men are en route to his residence.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.042
Here we are.

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:14.542
This is officer Choi from the courthouse.

01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:18.625
And this is Lord Jo's son, Yoon.

01:23:19.042 --> 01:23:20.542
Pleased to meet you.

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:23.709
Likewise.

01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:29.792
These are my personal guards.

01:23:30.042 --> 01:23:35.334
They were all military officers,
so bandits are no match for them.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:40.459
You mustn't underestimate your enemies.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.375
In any case, since your men
are versed in military tactics,

01:23:46.459 --> 01:23:48.209
our plan will go smoothly.

01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:51.167
I sense a hint of sarcasm.

01:23:51.667 --> 01:23:56.334
Could you be implying that you're not prepared?

01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:00.584
Do I sound so obvious?

01:24:01.042 --> 01:24:03.125
I'm just being comical.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:12.209
You're wicked, then. This isn't a time for jokes.

01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:13.542
Master.

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.417
We have some guests, sir.

01:24:18.542 --> 01:24:21.417
Good to see you all.

01:24:21.834 --> 01:24:26.667
With them by my side, I feel safe already.

01:24:32.292 --> 01:24:35.709
Do you agree? Aren't they magnificent?

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:59.584
Again, never put personal
vendettas ahead of the plan.

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:01.875
Promise me.

01:25:04.834 --> 01:25:09.084
They don't quite instill confidence in me.

01:25:10.917 --> 01:25:15.250
Now that my men are here and
we're running out of time,

01:25:15.334 --> 01:25:18.250
I'll brief you on the plan.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:29.959
As you know, the bandits want grains and jewels.

01:25:30.084 --> 01:25:32.584
Your men can hide here for an ambush,

01:25:32.584 --> 01:25:36.375
and my men will wait inside the house.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:40.084
Whoever spots the bandits first should signal.

01:25:40.417 --> 01:25:41.834
Remember this.

01:25:42.084 --> 01:25:44.667
We're not here for a killing spree.

01:25:44.834 --> 01:25:47.042
We need them alive.

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:50.709
Wait.

01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:55.584
In case something goes wrong,

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:59.667
I'll assign two of my men to look after father.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.959
Of course, whatever you want.

01:26:56.959 --> 01:26:58.125
Master.

01:27:00.584 --> 01:27:01.917
Come in.

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:12.250
What is it?

01:27:27.917 --> 01:27:30.917
Master, are you feeling well?

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:32.750
Who are you?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.167
Master Jo,

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.459
I feel rather offended.

01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:41.500
How could you not remember me?

01:27:41.875 --> 01:27:44.667
I was expecting a clan,

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.834
but it's just you?

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:51.125
I guess you're not the listening type.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.500
You remember the girl at the temple?

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:57.917
Your sister-in-law.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.167
I was gonna kill her,

01:28:02.667 --> 01:28:06.417
but I was quite lonely, so I kept her.

01:28:15.584 --> 01:28:19.000
I took you for a butcher with a long life,

01:28:19.334 --> 01:28:23.917
but you walked right through the gateway to hell.

01:28:24.625 --> 01:28:28.834
There's only one way to find out.

01:29:46.084 --> 01:29:51.000
Thought your street fighting skills
would be enough?

01:29:52.917 --> 01:29:55.334
Where's the girl?

01:29:55.459 --> 01:29:58.750
She gave birth to a tough little bastard.

01:29:58.917 --> 01:30:01.584
You heard me right.

01:30:02.459 --> 01:30:05.292
He's such a strong kid,

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:10.709
his balls are already double your head,
motherfucker!

01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:37.625
Come take your rice!

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:40.292
Come to city hall!

01:31:40.292 --> 01:31:42.292
Get your rice!

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:49.000
There's no time! Please hurry!

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.292
Father, this'll feed us for months!

01:32:03.375 --> 01:32:06.334
There's only one reason
why you're still breathing.

01:32:07.584 --> 01:32:12.834
Once we leave, give back all
the lands Jo Yoon stole.

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:16.750
If not, we'll break every bone in your body,

01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:18.667
and gut you alive.

01:32:19.084 --> 01:32:20.250
Yes, sir.

01:32:21.167 --> 01:32:24.459
Please let me live. I'll do everything you ask.

01:32:54.167 --> 01:32:56.875
What brings you here, Master Jo?

01:33:06.084 --> 01:33:08.750
Are you from the capital precinct?

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:11.042
We are indeed.

01:33:16.667 --> 01:33:20.000
Has a rider passed through here?

01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:22.042
That's news to me.

01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:25.959
We've been stationed here since 11 PM,

01:33:26.584 --> 01:33:28.792
and we haven't seen anyone.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.500
Can you tell me why
that horse is breathing so hard?

01:33:56.292 --> 01:34:01.500
Be calm, young man.

01:34:03.917 --> 01:34:05.500
Put your sword away.

01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:10.000
I knew I sensed some foul spirits,

01:34:10.209 --> 01:34:12.959
you must be the bandits.

01:34:15.292 --> 01:34:17.667
The fog will be heavy.

01:34:18.209 --> 01:34:20.625
If he comes within view,

01:34:20.792 --> 01:34:23.042
get ready to fire.

01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:25.042
Don't forget.

01:36:47.375 --> 01:36:49.709
Where are your manners?

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:52.667
Topknots are for married men.

01:36:56.167 --> 01:36:59.375
Cowering away is your only chance to live.

01:37:00.167 --> 01:37:02.125
I'll count to 3,

01:37:02.292 --> 01:37:05.917
so run like hell.

01:37:06.375 --> 01:37:07.667
Got it?

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:15.542
Big words for someone
who can't even defend himself.

01:37:16.959 --> 01:37:21.875
Perhaps you'll do better in hell.

01:37:22.459 --> 01:37:23.750
One!

01:37:24.792 --> 01:37:26.125
Two!

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:29.542
Three!

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:46.792
Ignorant ones are always the strongest.

01:38:49.875 --> 01:38:52.417
It's fun to kill, isn't it?

01:38:55.459 --> 01:39:01.000
Should the master leave home,
while the bandits are around?

01:39:03.334 --> 01:39:07.417
Not bad for bait, huh?

01:39:29.875 --> 01:39:33.334
Why are you all so weak?

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:37.792
Carry two at a time to balance your balls! Hurry!

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.250
Take this!

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.250
Where's the captain and everyone?
They should be here.

01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:48.875
That's true. Something must've happened.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.209
- Here they come.
- Hey!

01:39:53.375 --> 01:39:54.167
Ma-hyang!

01:39:54.167 --> 01:39:55.625
What happened?

01:39:56.542 --> 01:39:58.167
Grab him!

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.625
Careful, now.

01:40:02.375 --> 01:40:04.334
Where's captain and the others?

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.459
I dunno about the captain,

01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:08.542
but the others...

01:40:10.459 --> 01:40:12.084
they're dead.

01:40:12.209 --> 01:40:14.209
- What?
- The compassion of Buddha.

01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:16.375
I don't believe this...

01:40:19.917 --> 01:40:21.500
Take him to the boat first.

01:40:23.334 --> 01:40:24.667
Clear the way!

01:40:24.792 --> 01:40:26.084
Move aside!

01:40:26.334 --> 01:40:27.209
Tae-gi.

01:40:27.209 --> 01:40:28.459
Load the boat!

01:40:28.584 --> 01:40:31.250
Take Dochi to Naewon Temple.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.542
And you?

01:40:32.542 --> 01:40:35.709
I need to bring back the captain.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.917
What'll you do?

01:40:38.917 --> 01:40:40.417
Go on now.

01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.500
Please...

01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:47.917
Hurry!

01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:52.417
Let's set sail!

01:41:08.292 --> 01:41:10.750
Captain! Captain!

01:41:10.959 --> 01:41:12.417
Wake up!

01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:14.292
Please, captain.

01:41:16.167 --> 01:41:19.292
You still lack discipline.

01:41:20.167 --> 01:41:22.750
Why did you come?

01:41:29.959 --> 01:41:32.792
One must die quietly.

01:41:41.959 --> 01:41:43.375
Brother...

01:41:46.292 --> 01:41:49.625
I'll die one way or another.

01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:52.084
Brother...

01:41:53.334 --> 01:41:57.500
Grit your teeth,

01:42:00.667 --> 01:42:02.334
and walk away.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.917
Just hold on...

01:42:06.625 --> 01:42:07.792
Captain.

01:42:17.417 --> 01:42:19.250
May you rest with the Buddha.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:54.667
Act 5: United, You Are People,
Divided, You Are Thieves

01:42:57.834 --> 01:42:59.375
Damn you!

01:43:05.792 --> 01:43:07.875
I'll ask one more time.

01:43:08.375 --> 01:43:11.334
Where are the bandits hiding?

01:43:11.584 --> 01:43:14.000
I already told you.

01:43:14.584 --> 01:43:18.542
Everyone in this world is a thief.

01:43:18.875 --> 01:43:23.667
Some here, some at the capital.

01:43:23.834 --> 01:43:28.959
You'd have to be blind to not find one.

01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:33.584
Even grannies at the farm are thieves, got it?

01:43:39.917 --> 01:43:41.334
Master Jo.

01:43:42.417 --> 01:43:44.584
What should we do now?

01:43:45.167 --> 01:43:49.875
The chief could strip me of my position.

01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:55.000
You said the bandits gave away rice
in front of your office last night?

01:43:57.167 --> 01:43:59.209
Listen carefully!

01:44:00.459 --> 01:44:03.125
Whoever received the rice from the bandits,

01:44:04.209 --> 01:44:07.292
return every ounce of it by sunset.

01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:12.625
Those who do not comply

01:44:13.125 --> 01:44:15.459
are allies of the bandits,

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.584
and will be punished.

01:44:28.042 --> 01:44:29.584
What will you do?

01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:31.959
Anyone going back?

01:44:32.292 --> 01:44:34.250
If we unite and hold out,

01:44:35.125 --> 01:44:38.167
what can he do? He can't kill us all.

01:44:38.584 --> 01:44:41.375
No one should return any rice, okay?

01:44:45.792 --> 01:44:47.792
I was gonna return it, master!

01:44:47.959 --> 01:44:50.875
Please! Father! Father!

01:44:50.875 --> 01:44:52.500
Take care of the kids!

01:45:08.292 --> 01:45:11.459
I see that you're not afraid to die.

01:45:11.667 --> 01:45:14.334
Life and death are one.

01:45:14.834 --> 01:45:17.750
How could I be afraid?

01:45:17.959 --> 01:45:20.375
The compassion of Buddha.

01:45:20.542 --> 01:45:24.875
Let's see how much of that you truly believe.

01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:31.792
Where is your base of operations?

01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:38.209
What are you doing?

01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:42.167
You monks appreciate even
the most insignificant lives.

01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:46.500
Two will fall next, then four.

01:45:46.625 --> 01:45:48.042
You mustn't!

01:45:48.209 --> 01:45:50.542
Where is your base?

01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:01.959
Please don't kill us, master!

01:46:02.084 --> 01:46:04.209
Please show us mercy!

01:46:04.209 --> 01:46:06.459
It's him you should be begging to!

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.917
Your lives depend on his words.

01:46:10.042 --> 01:46:15.542
- Monk!
- Monk, save us!

01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:22.000
So, I'll ask you again.

01:46:22.125 --> 01:46:24.334
Lower your sword!

01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:29.334
The power you cannot control will only harm you!

01:46:29.417 --> 01:46:31.250
Lower your sword!

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.417
Stop it!

01:46:35.167 --> 01:46:38.042
Stop! Enough!

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:44.250
I will not forgive you, even in death!

01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:49.084
Mercy and forgiveness are Buddhist values.

01:46:51.959 --> 01:46:55.792
You are far from reaching enlightenment.

01:47:58.542 --> 01:47:59.667
You're back!

01:47:59.667 --> 01:48:01.709
Your late father always said,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.042
'know your place in life.'

01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:09.125
We cannot survive just by being good.

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.417
- Dochi!
- Brother!

01:48:33.667 --> 01:48:36.000
Listen to his thundering cry!

01:48:37.125 --> 01:48:38.792
Give it a good push!

01:48:38.959 --> 01:48:41.125
Babies need tits.

01:48:41.334 --> 01:48:43.959
That's why he's crying.

01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:45.834
Give him a tit to suck on.

01:48:45.834 --> 01:48:48.084
I'm a little busy, bugger off.

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:03.875
Dae-nam!

01:50:01.542 --> 01:50:03.500
Open your eyes!

01:50:13.125 --> 01:50:14.917
Find the bald bandit.

01:50:35.042 --> 01:50:37.000
You sons of bitches!

01:50:47.917 --> 01:50:49.625
Get inside.

01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:51.375
It hurts so much...

01:50:51.375 --> 01:50:55.334
I'll come right back.
Don't come outside, you hear?

01:51:21.459 --> 01:51:22.834
Morn!

01:52:01.875 --> 01:52:03.584
Mommy!

01:52:31.667 --> 01:52:33.625
Come at me!

01:55:37.292 --> 01:55:39.959
You just fucking wait,

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:45.750
I'll skin them alive from head to toe...

01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:42.334
The bandits are wiped out thanks to you,

01:56:42.334 --> 01:56:45.834
you'll be handsomely rewarded.

01:56:46.042 --> 01:56:48.625
Master Jo played a crucial role.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:53.667
When the regional governor arrives,
I'll speak to him

01:56:53.792 --> 01:56:56.625
about your compensation.

01:57:06.292 --> 01:57:08.584
Pardon me, gentlemen.

01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:58.625
He's not the baby you're looking for.

01:58:00.042 --> 01:58:01.917
Please give him to me.

01:58:03.584 --> 01:58:05.459
Don't you dare come near!

01:58:06.875 --> 01:58:08.625
Please lower your sword.

01:58:08.834 --> 01:58:14.792
Come any closer, and I'll slice you open!

01:58:27.667 --> 01:58:30.167
No better than a beast!

01:58:30.417 --> 01:58:33.000
Even as a concubine's son,

01:58:33.334 --> 01:58:37.625
how could you wish ill of your nephew?

01:58:38.792 --> 01:58:40.167
For my whole life,

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:46.542
I was no better than a beast to my father.

01:58:47.792 --> 01:58:50.000
There's nothing I cannot do.

01:58:50.125 --> 01:58:51.542
Shut up!

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:54.959
I should've left you at the whorehouse.

01:58:55.125 --> 01:58:57.500
Or beaten you to death.

01:58:57.667 --> 01:59:00.500
It was my fault to bring you in

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:02.709
because you have my blood in you.

01:59:02.959 --> 01:59:06.750
How dare you?

01:59:09.459 --> 01:59:11.709
Why didn't you just leave me?

01:59:12.542 --> 01:59:15.167
Why did you keep me alive?

01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:19.000
Why did you make me into this?

01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:23.084
All I wanted...

01:59:24.542 --> 01:59:27.500
was for you to acknowledge me.

01:59:32.084 --> 01:59:34.959
What am I to you?

02:00:26.417 --> 02:00:28.167
Here is your sentence!

02:00:33.292 --> 02:00:36.417
The Mt. Jiri bandits' crimes are as follows:

02:00:36.959 --> 02:00:42.959
First, larceny and the murder of noblemen.

02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:49.292
Second, creating public unrest
and distributing stolen property.

02:00:49.625 --> 02:00:51.042
Third,

02:00:51.125 --> 02:00:55.834
occupying public land without permission.

02:00:55.959 --> 02:00:57.625
And finally,

02:00:58.084 --> 02:01:03.834
blaming national law to defend their crimes.

02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:06.792
Execute!

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:06.959
I'll kill every one of you!

02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:12.250
Ma-hyang!

02:02:14.625 --> 02:02:16.542
Get the hell out of my way!

02:02:38.459 --> 02:02:44.709
United, we are people, divided, we are thieves!

02:02:44.875 --> 02:02:47.917
You sons of bitches!

02:03:24.917 --> 02:03:26.542
Let go of me!

02:03:34.084 --> 02:03:35.709
How dare you!

02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:44.584
You'll be punished!

02:03:48.792 --> 02:03:50.084
Move, move!

02:03:50.084 --> 02:03:51.417
Just hold on!

02:03:54.417 --> 02:03:56.375
Are you okay? Let me see you.

02:03:58.459 --> 02:03:59.875
I'm so sorry.

02:04:02.459 --> 02:04:04.084
It's all over now.

02:04:08.959 --> 02:04:10.084
You kids all right?

02:05:23.792 --> 02:05:28.084
Is it God's will, or the lotus flower's intention,

02:05:29.375 --> 02:05:33.750
when it blooms in the mud?

02:05:59.209 --> 02:06:02.709
I will not be so generous anymore,

02:06:04.084 --> 02:06:06.417
so just walk away.

02:06:06.625 --> 02:06:08.042
Come again?

02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:10.084
Look at this douche.

02:06:10.625 --> 02:06:14.500
Your arrogance will be the death of you.

02:06:14.959 --> 02:06:16.875
Walk away?

02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:21.709
You are the sworn enemy of the people.

02:06:22.292 --> 02:06:25.084
And my sworn nemesis.

02:06:27.625 --> 02:06:35.417
Fine. One more in the grave won't bother the dead.

02:06:36.084 --> 02:06:37.792
Come again?

02:06:38.209 --> 02:06:40.042
Someone else died?

02:06:41.042 --> 02:06:43.417
I'll free your repulsive face-

02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:46.709
from your body.

02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:01.000
If any of you...

02:07:01.584 --> 02:07:06.084
dare risk your lives to
change your fate, then come!

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.250
I'll accept your challenge.

02:07:45.209 --> 02:07:47.959
Son of a whore!

02:07:49.125 --> 02:07:50.375
Come!

02:08:25.917 --> 02:08:27.334
Motherfucker.

02:09:22.875 --> 02:09:27.250
I'll cook your liver and have a drink tonight.

02:12:16.917 --> 02:12:18.625
Attain your fucking Buddhahood.
