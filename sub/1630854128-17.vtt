00:04.482 --> 00:06.963
<i>Here at Gaffney
Chicago Medical Center...</i>

00:06.963 --> 00:08.617
We'll want to get
as much press as possible.

00:08.617 --> 00:11.794
They're doing infomercials
for 2.0 now?

00:11.794 --> 00:14.927
When you were a kid, you
started having your problems,

00:14.927 --> 00:16.973
and I wasn't there for you.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.540
You're here now.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.934
I could construct
a neural network

00:21.934 --> 00:25.068
and compare it against tens of
thousands of known mutations.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.374
<i>I wonder
if you might train me</i>

00:26.374 --> 00:28.289
on that new program
you were talking about.

00:28.289 --> 00:31.857
Dr. Halstead,
can you give Dr. Song a hand?

00:35.687 --> 00:38.038
You can't play
with the bumpers up.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.430
So what?
I'm not embarrassed.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.171
How are you supposed
to improve?

00:41.171 --> 00:42.868
Who said anything
about improving?

00:42.868 --> 00:43.913
I'm here for the drinks.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.263
Maggie's buying first round?

00:46.263 --> 00:47.569
That's what I heard.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.049
This is why I don't
invite you two out,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.050
because you're cheap.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.355
Where's Ben?

00:51.355 --> 00:52.791
The science fair is tomorrow.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.402
He's prepping the gym
for a mass eruption

00:54.402 --> 00:56.099
of baking soda volcanoes.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.667
But don't you worry,
I got a fourth.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.321
Oh, yeah? Who?

01:00.321 --> 01:02.758
Hey, Grace.
Over here.

01:02.758 --> 01:03.889
Word is she's single.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.630
What, you're trying
to set us up?

01:05.630 --> 01:06.631
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.807
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.375
- We're hitting the bar.
- Can we get you anything?

01:11.375 --> 01:13.116
Oh, my gosh, yeah.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.249
Guinness.
Anything dark, really.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.729
Anything dark.
Just like Halstead.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.383
Go figure.

01:19.383 --> 01:22.082
Well, be back in a flash.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.217
Didn't know you bowled.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.567
Neither did I,
until undergrad.

01:29.567 --> 01:32.092
It's the least
physically demanding gym credit

01:32.092 --> 01:33.354
I could get away with.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.399
Not too analog
for your taste?

01:35.399 --> 01:36.879
It's not gonna do much
for my street cred,

01:36.879 --> 01:38.228
but I fell in love with it.

01:38.228 --> 01:41.144
The physics of the game,
it's just really elegant.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.973
Besides, Jack has me all over
the place these past few years,

01:43.973 --> 01:45.235
and it's easy
to find an alley

01:45.235 --> 01:46.758
pretty much anywhere
in the world.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.412
It's comforting,

01:48.412 --> 01:51.937
finding something familiar
when you travel all the time.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.591
Maybe it's the smell.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.767
Floor wax, sweaty shoes,
and old beer.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.596
It's the sweaty shoes
that do it for me.

02:04.689 --> 02:07.910
You gonna have to tell me
if I'm any good, though.

02:10.826 --> 02:14.699
Rarely in one place long enough
to see how I stack up.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.397
All right.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.489
Dr. Berger said
placement went smoothly.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.752
- So I can get out of here?
- I'd say so.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.710
Remember to keep the site
sterile every time

02:25.710 --> 02:27.495
you connect to the cycler.
- Yeah, spare me the speech.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.627
I've placed hundreds
of PD catheters.

02:29.627 --> 02:32.500
You sure?
It's a pretty good speech.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.545
Just take it easy on yourself.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.417
Peritoneal dialysis
will let you keep working,

02:36.417 --> 02:38.723
but you won't be feeling 100%
anytime soon.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.812
I'll take it
under advisement.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.258
Hey, sweetie.
Still at it?

02:51.258 --> 02:52.607
Yeah.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.218
Well, I just have one more.
I'm almost done.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.351
But Notre Dame, Northwestern,

02:57.351 --> 02:59.004
and the University of Chicago
are all finished.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.005
I just need to submit them.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.833
Wow.

03:01.833 --> 03:06.186
So proud of you, sweetie,
how hard you've worked.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.318
What's the last one?

03:08.318 --> 03:10.538
- Stanford.
- Stanford?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.844
Well, their school
of sustainability

03:12.844 --> 03:14.846
has all these research groups
on everything

03:14.846 --> 03:18.459
from decommissioning combustion
engines to carbon storage.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.243
The opportunities are unreal.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.419
And I think I'd actually
have a decent shot at it.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.205
I guess I just thought
that you were planning

03:25.205 --> 03:26.989
to stay closer to Chicago.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.470
Well, yeah,
I mean, obviously I do.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.342
I mean, I was just
considering all the options.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.822
As well you should.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.303
Um, honey, I don't want
to slow your roll,

03:36.303 --> 03:37.782
so keep up the good work.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.611
And just give me a shout
if you need anything.

03:43.092 --> 03:46.530
What can you tell us
about Kuan-yu's journey?

03:46.530 --> 03:49.533
Kuan-yu has a condition
called ankylosing spondylitis.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.535
It's an inflammatory disease.

03:51.535 --> 03:55.365
As it progresses, it fuses
the vertebrae of the spine.

03:55.365 --> 03:59.500
I took him many places,
but no one fixed him.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.024
No, it didn't work at all.

04:02.024 --> 04:05.245
We always hoped
that it would stop,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.898
but he got more bent over.

04:06.898 --> 04:11.729
Kuan-yu, how long have you
been in this position?

04:11.729 --> 04:15.167
I have not laid on my back
in 19 years.

04:15.167 --> 04:20.303
It must be hard to function,
to do everyday things.

04:20.303 --> 04:25.482
Yes, but my mother
helps me in all ways.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.441
She keeps my hope alive.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.445
Can you tell us
how they came to Chicago Med?

04:31.445 --> 04:34.752
An international aid organization

04:34.752 --> 04:38.756
tried to pair Kuan-yu with
a number of renowned surgeons,

04:38.756 --> 04:40.497
but they all declined his case.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.107
They were too scared.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.980
Yeah, there are significant
technical challenges

04:44.980 --> 04:46.329
to a surgery like this.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.549
A similar procedure
was performed

04:48.549 --> 04:50.028
in China a few years ago,

04:50.028 --> 04:52.422
but it was spaced out
over several months.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.207
Not everywhere is equipped
for something like this.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.602
But thankfully, social media
jumped to the rescue

04:58.602 --> 05:01.562
and tagged Dr. Marcel.

05:01.562 --> 05:04.173
Yeah, I knew we should
and could help,

05:04.173 --> 05:06.741
so I presented Kuan-yu's case
to Jack Dayton,

05:06.741 --> 05:08.917
and he immediately agreed.

05:08.917 --> 05:12.660
Mr. Dayton flew us here,
paid everything.

05:12.660 --> 05:17.317
He asked nothing
but to make this film.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.409
Mr. Dayton and Dr. Marcel
are my angels.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.631
Kuan-yu has candidly
discussed the risks,

05:27.631 --> 05:29.329
and he's mentally prepared.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.679
But are you concerned?

05:31.679 --> 05:34.377
Tomorrow's surgery has
been meticulously planned

05:34.377 --> 05:35.813
for months,

05:35.813 --> 05:38.468
and I have full faith
in our doctors and nurses.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.731
And we have OR 2.0.

05:40.731 --> 05:44.387
Because Kuan-yu's spine
is one long, rigid bone,

05:44.387 --> 05:46.824
there are severe risks involved

05:46.824 --> 05:48.870
in separating
and reconstructing it,

05:48.870 --> 05:51.089
which is where 2.0
is a gamechanger,

05:51.089 --> 05:53.091
allowing us to be more precise

05:53.091 --> 05:55.442
as we perform a series
of osteotomies, meaning--

05:55.442 --> 05:57.139
Sorry to interrupt
the infomercial,

05:57.139 --> 06:00.577
but would you rather hear this
from the surgeon

06:00.577 --> 06:03.841
who's actually performing
the procedure?

06:03.841 --> 06:06.670
This is Dr. Abrams,
our chief of neurosurgery

06:06.670 --> 06:09.325
and lead surgeon
on Kuan-yu's surgery.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.633
Yes, and Dr. Marcel,
our esteemed general surgeon,

06:12.633 --> 06:14.286
will be assisting.

06:14.286 --> 06:17.028
Yes, I will be
helping Dr. Abrams

06:17.028 --> 06:20.423
gain access to Kuan-yu's spine
via anterior approaches.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.990
So as we discussed,

06:21.990 --> 06:24.384
we'll be placing screws
along every level of the spine,

06:24.384 --> 06:27.865
connected by at least four rods
from the skull to the pelvis,

06:27.865 --> 06:30.781
along with multiple
pedicle subtraction osteotomies

06:30.781 --> 06:32.653
and cerebral column resections.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.698
Dr. Abrams,
this is wonderful,

06:34.698 --> 06:36.700
but could you turn
and face the camera

06:36.700 --> 06:39.399
and give us that information
again in layman's terms

06:39.399 --> 06:42.750
for our documentary audience?

06:42.750 --> 06:45.143
Your show pony's right there.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.627
Yes, I'll be happy
to translate.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.421
Hey, Sharon.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.161
How was filming last night?
- Fine.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.163
I'm relieved my part is over.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.991
And the filming
will be completed

07:06.991 --> 07:08.689
after the surgery today.

07:08.689 --> 07:11.343
You don't sound too happy
about the documentary.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.737
Well, I think
Jack has a unique

07:13.737 --> 07:17.088
and commendable understanding
of the power of PR.

07:17.088 --> 07:20.744
Go on.
I'm listening for the "but."

07:20.744 --> 07:22.659
Having cameras
in the hospital

07:22.659 --> 07:26.620
doesn't exactly create
a therapeutic environment.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.404
Yeah, I hear you.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.493
But, Sharon,
this is the kind of case

07:30.493 --> 07:34.671
that puts Gaffney on par
with the Mayo Clinic.

07:34.671 --> 07:38.153
Well, I can't pretend that
I don't like the sound of that.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.633
So for everyone's sake,

07:39.633 --> 07:42.200
let's hope
that there's a good outcome.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.072
Now that sounds like a plan.

07:49.294 --> 07:53.081
So that four-bagger earn me
a spot on the practice team?

07:53.081 --> 07:56.606
I think you had us
all outclassed.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.695
You held your own.

07:58.695 --> 08:03.308
Maybe we could square off
sometime, you and me.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.921
Sure. Sounds good.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.969
Got to run.
Big day in 2.0.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.493
Good luck.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.715
Kind of flat-footed,
Halstead.

08:18.715 --> 08:19.760
What?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.544
Will and Grace.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.242
It has a nice,
familiar ring to it.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.419
If I'm correct,
they were just friends.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.725
OK, come on.

08:28.725 --> 08:32.076
You can't talk to your ex
about your new crush?

08:32.076 --> 08:33.469
I think you misread
the situation.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.348
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:43.348 --> 08:44.567
- Mornin'.
- Whoa, whoa.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.656
What's with the jacket?

08:46.656 --> 08:49.441
- I work here now.
- Yeah, that much I guessed.

08:49.441 --> 08:50.660
Wow.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.749
You all right?

08:52.749 --> 08:53.924
Yeah, I slept funny.

08:53.924 --> 08:57.101
So you're parking cars.

08:57.101 --> 09:00.627
Hannah--
Dr. Asher hooked me up.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.932
Sent over the job opening.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.108
Put in a good word.
- How considerate of her.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.719
Well, I wanted
to surprise you.

09:05.719 --> 09:08.069
Hey, you think I should, like,
write her a thank you note?

09:08.069 --> 09:09.287
Is that weird?

09:09.287 --> 09:10.550
Maybe I'll buy her
a cup of coffee.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.422
I'll pass along your regards.
Hustle up.

09:13.422 --> 09:16.294
You don't want to be written up
for loitering on the job.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.955
Dr. Archer, good morning.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.304
How are you?
- Fine.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.916
Why would you ask me that?
- No reason.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.613
Anything you need?
Water or--

09:30.613 --> 09:32.572
Yeah,
I need residents to talk less.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.313
Hey.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.577
Hey, how'd the PD cath go?
- OK.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.709
Why would you
get Sean a job here?

09:39.709 --> 09:41.319
Excuse me?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.974
Every person in this place
knows what's going on with me.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.498
How long do you think it'll be
before he finds out the news?

09:46.498 --> 09:48.457
Wait. He doesn't know
about your renal failure?

09:48.457 --> 09:50.111
And I had planned
to keep it that way.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.896
Listen, I just got
this kid back, all right?

09:52.896 --> 09:56.291
With his sobriety, I don't want
to burden him with my stuff.

09:56.291 --> 09:59.250
OK, Dean, I'm sorry
if I'm butting in here,

09:59.250 --> 10:02.863
but sobriety depends
on both of you being honest.

10:02.863 --> 10:06.083
If you really want that
real relationship with Sean,

10:06.083 --> 10:07.258
he needs to know.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.564
You are butting in,
all right?

10:08.564 --> 10:10.871
And I'll tell him
when he's ready.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.613
OK, hey.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.703
If you need a hand
with anything, I'm here.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.661
I know that the first
few nights of dialysis

10:18.661 --> 10:19.967
can be really rough.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.100
Yeah, I'm not in the market
for a nursemaid.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.019
I can help.
His veins roll.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.413
Oh, I've got it.
Thank you.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.723
- He can't keep it?
- No, I'm sorry.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.377
He can't wear anything
during surgery.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.206
Hey, Dan.
Everything good?

10:42.206 --> 10:44.121
Yeah. Ms. Goodwin
asked me to come down,

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
you know,
check up on your patient.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.125
Big, stressful day,
even without the damn cameras.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.387
But he seems to be doing great,

10:49.387 --> 10:51.172
you know,
focused on the positives.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.782
Well, looks like
we're ready to go.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.001
Exciting day, huh?

10:54.001 --> 10:56.264
- Good luck.
- Thanks, buddy.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.570
Hey, Kuan-yu.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.224
It's Dr. Marcel.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.139
Ready to see the world?

11:02.139 --> 11:03.706
I am born ready.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.882
Oh, that's the spirit.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.058
Good, buddy.
Great. All right.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.582
I'm gonna have you guys
step back for a moment.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.540
Thank you.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.765
Can I give you a hand?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.897
Did you need an extra bag
or anything?

11:20.897 --> 11:23.639
I can't keep still.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.032
Worse today.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.251
Perfectly normal
to be worried.

11:27.251 --> 11:31.908
Every day,
I get older, less strong,

11:31.908 --> 11:34.084
and he gets worse.

11:34.084 --> 11:38.741
So yes, I am worried today.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.047
But I am also hopeful.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.744
Good.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.660
- Maybe I go into surgery now.
- You know what?

11:44.660 --> 11:46.618
I'm afraid that
that's not gonna be possible.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.229
It's against hospital policy.

11:48.229 --> 11:51.058
No. No, I must be there.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.451
I'm so sorry that this wasn't
made clear to you earlier,

11:53.451 --> 11:55.236
but it's actually
for Kuan-yu's safety.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.281
But I can be useful.

11:57.281 --> 12:01.459
Maybe they have questions
or need help moving him.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.332
Mrs. Wu, your son is
in the best possible hands.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.726
Look, how about
if I find you a place to wait

12:06.726 --> 12:07.944
right next
to the operating room?

12:07.944 --> 12:10.120
That way, you can be
as close as possible.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.383
Would that
make you feel better?

12:20.522 --> 12:23.133
Dr. Archer, incoming MVC.
Going to Trauma 3.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.135
Zach, you're going with them.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.877
Court!
- Vincent Jones, 40s.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.618
T-boned at Cermak and Clark.

12:29.618 --> 12:30.793
GCS 8.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.317
Sats have been hovering
in the high 80s.

12:33.317 --> 12:34.971
- Pressure?
- 105 over 80.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.407
Heart rate's 135.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.148
All right, let's go.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.542
Get ready to transfer
on my count.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.544
Should we get an extra set
of hands so you don't have to--

12:42.544 --> 12:43.893
No.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.243
Ready?
One, two, three.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.550
Dr. Archer, are you--

12:48.550 --> 12:49.856
Yeah, just worry
about your patient, all right?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.161
What's the first order
of business?

12:51.161 --> 12:53.163
- Airway.
- Airway, right.

12:53.163 --> 12:56.166
Trini, I need ET kit,
RSI drugs.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.386
I need X-ray in here, please!

13:00.388 --> 13:01.693
All right.

13:01.693 --> 13:04.827
Feeling some instability
in the pelvis.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.177
What is taking so long?
- I think I've got it.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.876
- You think?
- I'm in.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.230
Breath sounds bilateral.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.797
Sats rising.
Pressure still soft.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.276
All right.
What's next, Zach?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.713
X-ray chest and pelvis,
and then a fast.

13:21.713 --> 13:22.932
You want
to resuscitate this guy

13:22.932 --> 13:25.369
or just let him die
while you order stuff?

13:25.369 --> 13:28.242
Right.
Two units whole blood.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.375
Negative fast.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.203
All right.
Where's my X-ray?

13:33.203 --> 13:34.857
All right, clear!

13:38.078 --> 13:40.341
Let's see it.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.082
Left-sided
posterior hip dislocation.

13:42.082 --> 13:45.520
- Got it in one. And?
- We'll need to reduce.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.087
Set the scoreboard
back to zero.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.436
He needs a panscan.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.829
Rule out cavitary hemorrhage.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.874
He might need surgery
before we reduce him.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.745
All right, let's move.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.062
Here we go.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.325
Kuan-yu's ready,
and the cameras are in place.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.632
I had the one at the head
of the table moved back.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.548
Better if you moved them
all the way out of the room.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.463
What, are you afraid
they're gonna throw you off?

14:15.463 --> 14:16.899
Nothing throws me off.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.728
I just don't think
publicity has a place in my OR.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.904
I'm surprised
you took this case then.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.601
Well,
I thought about refusing,

14:23.601 --> 14:25.168
but any other neurosurgeon

14:25.168 --> 14:27.692
would probably
paralyze the poor guy.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.999
Now, sadly,
at the end of the day,

14:29.999 --> 14:31.131
you and I are just shilling

14:31.131 --> 14:33.481
for a billionaire
padding his pockets.

14:33.481 --> 14:36.571
Well, if you want
to look at it that way, OK.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.052
But this surgery never would
have happened without 2.0,

14:39.052 --> 14:41.141
and it never would have
happened without Jack.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.447
Right. In other words,
your participation in it.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.671
Ms. Wallace,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.455
My mom's looking
after my son.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.587
Trying to explain

14:52.587 --> 14:54.589
how to swaddle
a six-week-old via text.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.938
Take your time.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.679
She'll manage.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.637
I turned out OK.

14:59.637 --> 15:00.682
So what brings you in today?

15:00.682 --> 15:02.379
Oh, here it comes.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.078
Asked and answered.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.383
How long you been
feeling this way?

15:06.383 --> 15:07.776
A few days now.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.865
I thought
maybe it was food poisoning,

15:09.865 --> 15:11.867
but it shouldn't
last this long, right?

15:11.867 --> 15:13.782
Could be
viral gastroenteritis.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.392
Stomach bug.
Easily treatable.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.438
But we'll start
with some labs and IV fluids.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.092
I can also prescribe you
something for nausea.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.615
That would be
much appreciated.

15:20.615 --> 15:21.833
All right.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.750
Here we go.

15:27.752 --> 15:31.800
You know, I did
the whole single-mom IVF thing.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.975
Everyone warned me
about the risks

15:32.975 --> 15:35.282
of a geriatric pregnancy.

15:35.282 --> 15:38.111
I didn't know the effects
would last postpartum.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.329
Well, we're gonna
get you sorted out

15:39.329 --> 15:41.027
and back to your son
as soon as possible.

15:41.027 --> 15:45.118
All right, CBC, BMP, KUB, and
bolus a liter of normal saline.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.815
- You got it.
- Thanks, Doc.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.034
Of course.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.997
Hey, can I get
your eyes on this?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.825
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

15:56.825 --> 15:59.001
40-year-old
IVF primip came in

15:59.001 --> 16:01.003
with nausea and vomiting,
but her labs are normal.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.918
- Tox?
- Clean.

16:02.918 --> 16:06.008
OK, yeah, her BP is up.
147 over 92.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.054
Yeah,
been that way since intake.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.317
- Could be preeclampsia?
- This far out?

16:10.317 --> 16:12.014
Yeah, it's rare,
but it happens.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.713
I'd check a CMP and PC ratio

16:15.713 --> 16:17.019
and consider mag,
just in case.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.325
I can do the order if you want.

16:18.325 --> 16:22.155
- Sure. Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:22.155 --> 16:25.071
Hey, Will, about earlier,

16:25.071 --> 16:27.203
you know, you and Grace...

16:27.203 --> 16:28.335
- Hannah--
- No.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.640
I never should have teased you.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.556
Obviously,
men and women can be friends.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.820
OK, look, even
if I were interested in her,

16:35.820 --> 16:36.952
Grace is a nomad.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.736
Jack has her
all over the world.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.782
It's tough to start something
with someone like that.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.218
Yeah.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.090
I'll let you know
when these labs come back.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.836
Cervicothoracic PSOs
look good.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.055
I think so.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.796
Let's see if 2.0 agrees.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.928
I don't need another opinion.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.539
Well,
it could only help us, Sam.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.670
Standby.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.413
OK, so 2.0 would determine

17:03.413 --> 17:07.548
if the osteotomy is at the
ideal depth, height, and angles

17:07.548 --> 17:09.028
to achieve correction.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.943
<i>Acceptable C7
and T1 osteotomies.</i>

17:11.943 --> 17:13.336
Acceptable?
It's perfect.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.077
Can you explain
how those lasers are helpful

17:15.077 --> 17:16.600
for the surgeons?

17:16.600 --> 17:19.560
Yeah, Dr. Marcel,
could you explain that?

17:22.954 --> 17:26.132
Uh, sure. Yeah.
Could you move over?

17:26.132 --> 17:29.091
In fact, direct your camera
towards the screen there.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.312
You'll see that 2.0
will superimpose lines

17:32.312 --> 17:35.576
onto the spine to help guide
the surgeon where to drill

17:35.576 --> 17:37.795
and the extent of bone
to remove.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.102
Dr. Abrams, I'm seeing
50% decreases in amplitude

17:40.102 --> 17:41.843
and increased latency
in both legs.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.149
Running a motor.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.065
Put the evoked
potential response on screen.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.501
Dr. Marcel,
is there a problem?

17:47.501 --> 17:49.546
Are we concerned with
cord injury and compression?

17:49.546 --> 17:51.113
Yeah, 'cause I'm assuming
that our patient's goal

17:51.113 --> 17:52.071
wasn't to become paralyzed.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.246
Push his MAPs.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.551
Reverse everything
that's reversible.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.379
Find out
if this IOM change is real.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.773
And if it is, close him up and
get him down for an MRI stat.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.470
MRI? No, hold on.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.994
We don't have to move him.
2.0 can do an intraop CT.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.126
Yeah,
which won't show me anything

18:04.126 --> 18:05.780
about cord edema
or ligamentous buckling.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.609
But if I can merge a CT with
an intraoperative ultrasound,

18:08.609 --> 18:10.263
you'd have everything
you'd need right here.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.352
That would work, and we
wouldn't have to move Kuan-yu.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.093
Look, experiment with
this thing on another patient.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.485
I want to be 100% sure.

18:15.485 --> 18:16.965
Sam, there are
a hundred reasons

18:16.965 --> 18:18.140
why we should not move him.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.533
Pick one.
Infection risk.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.187
Prolonged time
under anesthesia.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.058
Hell, he could even be unstable
after the move

18:23.058 --> 18:24.451
to even continue surgery.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.804
Do it.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.980
Let's hope you're right.

18:31.980 --> 18:35.331
Otherwise, you're committing a
career-ending mistake to film.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.512
You sure
there's nothing we can get you?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.819
Maybe something to eat?
- No.

18:44.819 --> 18:45.994
How are we doing?

18:45.994 --> 18:48.301
Any updates?
- Not yet.

18:48.301 --> 18:51.521
Oh, excuse me.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.310
You know,
that's a lovely stone.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.661
I was noticing it earlier
when I was talking to your son.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.011
From the river.

19:03.011 --> 19:06.188
Kuan-yu found this as a child.

19:06.188 --> 19:10.192
It was smooth and shiny.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.803
He thought it was a gem.

19:12.803 --> 19:18.809
It was one of the last times
he was able to move,

19:18.809 --> 19:20.855
to play.

19:20.855 --> 19:25.207
I made this to give him hope

19:25.207 --> 19:30.473
that one day
he would play again.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.435
I promised I would help him.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.567
Well, you have certainly
kept that promise.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.701
What's going on?

19:40.701 --> 19:42.964
- I need to talk to Da-xia.
- About what?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.357
There's been a complication,

19:44.357 --> 19:45.358
something
about a cord compression.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.707
I've got
to get her point of view.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.056
Now is not the time.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.843
Ms. Goodwin, this is
one of the major risks

19:52.843 --> 19:54.671
they knew he was facing.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.283
Narratively, that's important
to their story.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.198
Well, this is
not about a story.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.374
It's a complicated
medical procedure

20:01.374 --> 20:03.289
involving real people.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.639
I have a directive
from Mr. Dayton.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.685
She signed a contract
to be filmed.

20:08.685 --> 20:11.471
You film at my discretion,
not Jack Dayton's.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.560
And you can speak to Da-xia

20:13.560 --> 20:18.260
after the doctors provide
an update and not before.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.089
Well, I need
to call Mr. Dayton.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.786
Well, you just do that.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.704
Did he need to speak to me?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.097
Did he have news?

20:29.097 --> 20:31.404
No, nothing concrete.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.581
But the surgeons
will check in with you soon.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.365
Why don't we go wait
in my office?

20:36.365 --> 20:37.671
It's right upstairs,
and, you know,

20:37.671 --> 20:39.542
we'll be
more comfortable there.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.805
- Thank you, Dr. Charles.
- You bet.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.123
I'm not seeing
any obvious cord compression.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.125
That's why I'm also checking.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.781
His evoked potentials
look better.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.348
All right, I'm satisfied

21:02.348 --> 21:04.263
that the cord was merely
compressed, not injured.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.916
We can continue.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.657
Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah?

21:07.657 --> 21:12.619
Would you ask 2.0 to prepare
the next osteotomy, please?

21:12.619 --> 21:14.925
Certainly. Grace?

21:20.888 --> 21:22.672
Will?

21:22.672 --> 21:23.847
I'll call you back.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.675
Results
for your patient, Cara.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.287
Good news: doesn't look like
postpartum preeclampsia.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.027
Bad news is
nothing definitive

21:30.027 --> 21:31.246
to explain her symptoms.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.987
Yeah, I'm thinking stress.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.641
I mean, she did just
give birth six weeks ago,

21:34.641 --> 21:37.121
and pregnancy puts the body
at the literal limit

21:37.121 --> 21:39.123
of human endurance
for nine months.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.517
Makes sense that stress
would manifest physically.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.127
Yeah, I'll look into
anything else to test her for,

21:43.127 --> 21:44.259
but I think you're right.

21:48.307 --> 21:52.398
Dr. Archer,
do you want my seat?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.964
Uh, I'm good.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.444
I got
to turn six over anyway,

21:55.444 --> 21:56.967
so it's not a big deal.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.318
Listen, I'm not an invalid.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.841
I'm fine!

22:06.020 --> 22:07.761
- Dr. Archer?
- What?

22:07.761 --> 22:09.893
I have Vincent's CT results.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.766
He has a pelvic hematoma
with a blush.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.899
We need to embolize him.
Now we can reduce his hip.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.901
Send him up to IR.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.165
You ever done
an Allis reduction?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.732
- I've observed one.
- All right.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.344
Well, you're assisting me.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.347
Oh, what now?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.435
I just know
an Allis reduction

22:29.435 --> 22:31.306
can be physically taxing.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.481
And?

22:32.481 --> 22:34.048
I just don't think
it's the best idea

22:34.048 --> 22:35.484
for you to do this procedure.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.399
Yeah,
I'm an attending physician

22:37.399 --> 22:39.358
and the chief
of this department.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.795
I will not be advised
by some resident

22:41.795 --> 22:43.362
who barely knows what the hell
he's talking about!

22:43.362 --> 22:44.450
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you know what?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.147
Go get yourself
another case, man.

22:46.147 --> 22:48.323
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you said that!

22:48.323 --> 22:49.498
Go! Go!

22:49.498 --> 22:51.457
I have another patient
for you in two.

22:54.895 --> 22:55.765
Need a hand
with a hip reduction?

22:55.765 --> 22:56.940
Uh-uh.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.816
Dr. Archer,
I will not have you

23:02.816 --> 23:03.773
speaking to residents
like that.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.209
Can we just get this done?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.431
Murphy,
will you assist, please?

23:09.431 --> 23:11.912
Sure. No problem.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.479
Over here.
Push down on the pelvis

23:13.479 --> 23:16.438
and give Dr. Archer
counter traction.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.266
All right,
we're gonna do this in three.

23:18.266 --> 23:22.052
Ready?
One, two, three.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.793
That's good. It's in.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.882
Whoa. Are you OK?

23:25.882 --> 23:27.231
- I'm OK.
- No, you're not.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.407
I just got
to get him up to IR.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.321
Stop talking.
Murphy, you take him up.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.672
We need to get you in a bed.
Come on.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.456
All right.
All right.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.547
So you think
this was all stress?

23:38.547 --> 23:41.594
We could not find
any other clinical explanation.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.987
Stress takes
a real physical toll--

23:43.987 --> 23:46.250
nausea, vomiting, hypertension.

23:46.250 --> 23:49.253
All common
and treatable presentations,

23:49.253 --> 23:51.342
even in the case
of happy stress.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.519
We'll prescribe you
a low-dose antihypertensive

23:53.519 --> 23:54.563
for your blood pressure.

23:54.563 --> 23:55.651
But the best thing
you could do

23:55.651 --> 23:57.174
for yourself right now
is find ways

23:57.174 --> 23:58.437
to reduce your stress levels.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.048
I waited so long
to become a mother,

24:01.048 --> 24:03.442
probably too long,
if I'm being honest.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.965
I naively thought
the perfect moment

24:04.965 --> 24:06.923
would just waltz into my life.

24:06.923 --> 24:10.274
Now that my little Lee is here,
I don't want to miss anything.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.537
Well, he's a lucky boy.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.713
Don't forget to take
care of yourself too.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.975
Thank you.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.109
Cara?

24:19.109 --> 24:20.807
You OK?
- Floor... sliding.

24:20.807 --> 24:21.938
- OK.
- Help me.

24:21.938 --> 24:24.288
- Aphasia.
- Yeah.

24:24.288 --> 24:25.681
Stroke alert!
Need some help in here!

24:28.118 --> 24:30.817
You're OK.
Just breathe, breathe, breathe.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.254
OK, try to relax.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.524
All right.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.874
Nope.
No, no, back away.

24:44.874 --> 24:47.137
Let's close up
the lumbar PSO.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.617
Compressor and set screws.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.401
So Dr. Abrams and Gottfried
are placing

24:50.401 --> 24:52.142
the final bit
of instrumentation.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.580
Then they will
collapse Kuan-yu's spine,

24:54.580 --> 24:57.234
which will correct his posture
to an upright--

24:58.714 --> 25:01.151
His sats are dropping.
Heart rate and BP are down too.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.850
- Airway pressures?
- Peaks are 50s.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.243
Still dropping.
Sats at 80%.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.506
It must be due
to his position.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.072
Well, there's not much
we can do about that

25:09.072 --> 25:10.247
in the middle
of a spine surgery.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.727
It's got to be
a tension pneumothorax.

25:11.727 --> 25:12.902
Stethoscope?
- Hey.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.904
This isn't a trauma case.
Just bronch him.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.471
And check the tube's position.

25:16.471 --> 25:17.820
Kuan-yu's chest
and abdominal muscles

25:17.820 --> 25:19.213
are probably atrophied.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.910
When we straightened him,
we likely cracked a rib,

25:20.910 --> 25:22.042
punctured the lung.

25:24.479 --> 25:25.654
There.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.177
Diminished breath sounds
on the right.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.483
Chest tube kit
for Dr. Marcel.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.353
28 French.

25:29.353 --> 25:30.790
No, he needs a rescue now.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.226
What's happening?
Has Kuan-yu stopped breathing?

25:32.226 --> 25:33.575
I need
to needle decompress him.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.707
Chest tube later.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.839
Can you reach
the anterior chest?

25:36.839 --> 25:38.145
I've got no other option.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.712
Just get it done.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.676
Heart rate's 40.
Sats at 50s.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.895
Running out of time here, Crockett.

25:48.895 --> 25:49.852
Yeah, I don't want
to stick his heart.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.593
Not a ton of room to work.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.508
Dr. Marcel, can you explain--

25:53.508 --> 25:54.988
Be quiet!

25:56.598 --> 25:58.557
OK, needle's in.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.603
Oxygen saturation climbing.
85%.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.692
Airway pressure's down to 30.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.781
BP's back up to 120 systolic.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.742
OK.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.395
Let's finish up the spine.

26:15.443 --> 26:18.098
I need you to back up.
Back up.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.622
Doesn't look like
you tore the stitch.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.799
Probably
just overexerted yourself.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.280
Ah, wonderful.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.630
- There.
- Thank you.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.459
Who do you think
you're kidding

26:31.459 --> 26:32.634
with this tough guy act?

26:33.983 --> 26:35.898
Everyone here knows
what you're going through.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.683
Oh, well, see,
that's the problem.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.729
That's all they see:
a sick, weak old man.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.470
"Let me get that for you."
"Take my seat."

26:42.470 --> 26:45.647
"Should you be doing that?"
I can't stand that.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.170
There's no shame
in having an illness.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.521
Listen, I'm the doctor
in this ED, all right?

26:50.521 --> 26:51.479
I'm not a patient.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.654
Oh.

26:54.700 --> 26:59.182
You know,
I once thought like you.

27:01.010 --> 27:04.100
After my cancer diagnosis.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.800
I thought folks would only see
what was wrong with me,

27:07.800 --> 27:09.845
that every kind word
or offer to help

27:09.845 --> 27:13.327
was just an act of pity.

27:13.327 --> 27:16.156
Then someone who lived
through my experience

27:16.156 --> 27:18.549
made me realize how far
from the truth that was,

27:18.549 --> 27:22.945
that I was the only one
defining myself by my illness.

27:24.381 --> 27:28.168
My friends, my family,
my community,

27:28.168 --> 27:30.213
all they wanted to do
was support me.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.392
And all I needed to do
was let them.

27:38.874 --> 27:42.748
It's not weakness
to let people be kind.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.450
It's strength.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.061
OK.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.850
Oh.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.548
And Zach's a good doctor.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.855
He just needs to be encouraged.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.900
And that's our job.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.383
Message received.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.215
One chamomile tea.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.826
My mom drinks this
to help her sleep

28:17.826 --> 28:19.872
because she insists
on drinking coffee

28:19.872 --> 28:20.873
till late in the afternoon.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.048
Go figure.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.092
Oh.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.445
Yes?

28:30.578 --> 28:32.841
OK.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.364
Well, good.
I will tell her.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.758
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.979
So the surgery is complete,

28:39.979 --> 28:43.069
and Kuan-yu
came through it very well.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.201
As a matter of fact,
the next time you see him,

28:45.201 --> 28:47.987
he will probably be sitting up.

28:47.987 --> 28:51.164
You mean he'll stand?

28:51.164 --> 28:53.514
He'll walk?
- Yeah.

28:53.514 --> 28:56.343
With time, rehabilitation,

28:56.343 --> 28:58.432
he should live
a pretty normal life.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.306
Oh.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.180
Oh, my.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.313
I'm so sorry.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.794
No, you have absolutely
nothing to apologize for.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.144
There's a lot to take in.

29:15.144 --> 29:18.844
This is the day
we've been waiting for.

29:20.497 --> 29:24.719
All these years,
I take good care of him.

29:24.719 --> 29:29.680
And now,
what will happen now?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.117
This surgery has upended

29:31.117 --> 29:32.814
a life that you
and your son have known

29:32.814 --> 29:34.729
for, what,
almost 30 years?

29:34.729 --> 29:36.383
And it makes perfect sense

29:36.383 --> 29:38.428
that you would grieve
the loss of that life

29:38.428 --> 29:41.170
and be apprehensive
about the future.

29:41.170 --> 29:47.046
But this is not right,
these feelings.

29:49.178 --> 29:52.921
How can I think of me
at such a time?

29:52.921 --> 29:54.836
How can I be so selfish...

29:54.836 --> 29:56.838
- Oh, no, no.
- And not be happy?

29:56.838 --> 29:59.928
No, no, no.
You are not selfish.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.017
Every parent in the world

30:02.017 --> 30:03.932
understands
what you're feeling right now.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.325
From the moment
our kids are born,

30:05.325 --> 30:06.979
they start
to move away from us.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.503
And when they finally leave,

30:09.503 --> 30:13.202
it's only because we've
actually done our jobs well.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.686
But this, I can promise you:

30:18.686 --> 30:21.863
you will always be his mother.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.648
Always.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.869
One half of the same stone.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.933
As you can see...

30:47.933 --> 30:50.544
That's in my head?

30:50.544 --> 30:52.589
It's a condition
called Moyamoya disease.

30:52.589 --> 30:55.854
Moyamoya literally means
"puff of smoke" in Japanese.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.246
It's a progressive disorder

30:57.246 --> 30:59.509
which blocks blood flow
to your brain's arteries.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.250
So to compensate,
your body created

31:01.250 --> 31:04.123
all these smaller vessels,
which are prone to bleeding.

31:04.123 --> 31:06.865
So your symptoms were caused
by small strokes.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.692
Progressive.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.869
So this is going to get worse?

31:10.869 --> 31:13.480
Keeping you on aspirin
and calcium channel blockers

31:13.480 --> 31:16.222
will help reduce the risk
of another stroke.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.747
Just reduce but not prevent.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.923
It'll keep you stable
for the foreseeable future.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.143
There is a surgical option,

31:24.143 --> 31:25.927
but we don't think
that you're there yet.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.842
Surgery?

31:27.842 --> 31:29.409
I want the surgery.

31:29.409 --> 31:32.107
It's an invasive
neurosurgical procedure.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.414
You have a newborn.
You've been through a lot.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.156
The surgery can wait
for a more ideal time.

31:38.461 --> 31:43.162
I don't want this cloud
hanging over me.

31:44.641 --> 31:48.558
I've waited
for ideal times before.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.604
They don't come.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.738
Please, the surgery.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.092
We'll have neurosurgery
come speak to you.

32:00.092 --> 32:02.355
Thank you.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.704
Yeah.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.532
Dr. Hudgins.

32:07.664 --> 32:08.665
Yes?

32:08.665 --> 32:10.624
I hear our patient,
Mr. Jones,

32:10.624 --> 32:13.105
is resting comfortably
in the ICU

32:13.105 --> 32:15.716
after successful embolization.

32:15.716 --> 32:18.110
Oh, good.

32:18.110 --> 32:21.287
There's a sim dummy in seven.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.811
I'm gonna show you
how to reduce a hip.

32:23.811 --> 32:27.902
You said it was a physically
demanding procedure,

32:27.902 --> 32:31.123
so you're gonna do it.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.179
Mama.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.532
I can see you.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.752
Yes.

32:51.752 --> 32:57.105
And you look so beautiful.

32:57.105 --> 33:00.543
Mm-mm, I'm so old.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.155
No. No.

33:15.906 --> 33:18.126
I'll see you.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.302
A word, please.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.743
- Yes?
- Look.

33:26.743 --> 33:30.530
It's one thing to bar them from
filming her during surgery,

33:30.530 --> 33:33.707
but, Sharon, this is what
audiences would want to see.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.709
And you've stopped them
from capturing it.

33:35.709 --> 33:38.277
After all they've
been through, George,

33:38.277 --> 33:41.758
they deserve this time
without cameras.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.630
They wouldn't even have had
a chance to get this surgery

33:43.630 --> 33:45.371
if it wasn't
for Jack's generosity.

33:45.371 --> 33:48.069
Yes, and I still have
to look out for my patients.

33:48.069 --> 33:51.029
George, you're a doctor.
You know that.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.552
I do.

33:52.552 --> 33:58.427
But I also believe in Jack's
vision for this hospital.

33:58.427 --> 34:01.952
He wants us to be the leader
in cutting-edge healthcare.

34:01.952 --> 34:06.696
Sharon, this film tells
the world exactly who we are.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.481
And who are we, George,

34:08.481 --> 34:12.920
if we forget about our patients
and their loved ones?

34:12.920 --> 34:17.533
But Jack is a man who's not
used to hearing the word "no."

34:17.533 --> 34:20.580
Well, maybe it's time he did.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.107
Yeah.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.637
Hey, neurosurgery is getting
ready to operate on Cara.

34:34.637 --> 34:35.899
That's great.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.379
Woman's braver than I am.

34:37.379 --> 34:39.207
And me.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.777
Hey, you weren't wrong.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.910
I am interested in Grace.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.217
OK.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.527
So why did you give her
the brush-off this morning?

34:54.527 --> 34:57.921
And don't give me that stuff
about her being a nomad.

34:59.923 --> 35:02.056
I mean, look at
my dating track record here.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.667
Hasn't been exactly stellar.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.147
- No offense.
- Yeah.

35:10.020 --> 35:13.459
Well, I might be crazy
or out of line,

35:13.459 --> 35:18.681
but I wonder
if all of these excuses

35:18.681 --> 35:21.075
are really just
about one reason,

35:21.075 --> 35:23.251
or rather one person.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.126
Natalie.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.780
Natalie?

35:30.780 --> 35:32.782
You know,
it did always feel like

35:32.782 --> 35:35.568
you were still
carrying a torch for her.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.874
Yeah, maybe.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.398
Maybe I still was.

35:41.269 --> 35:46.448
But now, I mean, it's just me
trying to get it right.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.581
Good.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.454
You're a really
great guy, Will.

35:54.021 --> 35:56.589
You deserve to be happy.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.547
Thanks, Hannah.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.471
Now, what was
particularly difficult

36:09.471 --> 36:10.951
about this operation?

36:10.951 --> 36:15.216
Well, the angle
was slightly unusual.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.176
But fortunately, we were able
to relieve the pressure

36:18.176 --> 36:20.308
and reinflate his lung.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.919
You were basically
folded over yourself,

36:22.919 --> 36:25.835
and alarms were blaring, so...
- Right.

36:25.835 --> 36:29.230
Why don't you tell us
what you felt in that moment?

36:34.453 --> 36:38.152
I guess
the real headline here

36:38.152 --> 36:40.807
is successfully aligning
Kuan-yu's spine.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.636
You saw firsthand
a revolution in medicine,

36:43.636 --> 36:45.986
thanks in part to OR 2.0.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.901
I mean, this is
just the beginning

36:47.901 --> 36:50.947
of what
this Dayton partnership can--

36:50.947 --> 36:52.297
can produce.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.474
Yeah.

36:58.694 --> 37:01.175
Hell of a day, huh?

37:01.175 --> 37:02.437
Hope you're off to celebrate.

37:02.437 --> 37:03.917
You know, you're not
a terrible surgeon,

37:03.917 --> 37:06.876
but you do have awful taste
in heroes.

37:06.876 --> 37:09.401
Heroes?
Come on, Sam.

37:09.401 --> 37:11.794
At least he's using his
billions for some good, right?

37:11.794 --> 37:15.537
Oh, yeah, confident that's
why he amassed his fortune.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.583
Point is, we can help
so many more people

37:17.583 --> 37:20.194
with Jack's vision
and money in our corner.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.891
No, his vision
of whom to help

37:21.891 --> 37:23.676
seems a bit more narrow
than yours.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.808
- What does that mean?
- I just found out.

37:25.808 --> 37:30.204
Dayton says from now on, 2.0
is for paying customers only.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.554
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.077
No more subsidized care.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.122
Well, if that's true,
then your fight's

37:35.122 --> 37:37.037
with the insurance companies.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.667
We're all out
of the good stuff.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.104
Radiology's got
a secret stash, though.

38:01.104 --> 38:02.976
Thanks for the tip.

38:02.976 --> 38:05.935
Or maybe I could
buy you a cup of coffee.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.024
I don't think
that's a good idea.

38:08.024 --> 38:10.897
OK. Have a good night.

38:10.897 --> 38:13.116
What about a drink instead?

38:16.511 --> 38:18.034
Guinness, right?

38:18.034 --> 38:19.558
Mm-hmm.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.309
Guess that made you happy, huh?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.701
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.660
Ah.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.358
- I gather you told him.
- More or less.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.926
Told him I needed dialysis.
Left it pretty vague.

38:39.926 --> 38:42.407
But I don't want
to make him a caretaker.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.496
He doesn't need that right now.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.628
It's a good thing
you told him, though,

38:46.628 --> 38:48.674
not just for his sake.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.066
Good night, Dean.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.025
Wait, hold on.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.376
I have a favor to ask.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.688
Hey, Dad.
There's pizza in the fridge.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.430
I promise it's not Hawaiian.
- Wait.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.649
Are you finished
with your applications?

39:07.649 --> 39:09.042
Yeah.

39:09.042 --> 39:12.350
All proofed, agonized over,
and submitted.

39:12.350 --> 39:16.049
And I chose early decision
to University of Chicago.

39:16.049 --> 39:19.313
- What happened to Stanford?
- Nothing.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.402
I wasn't really
all that serious about it.

39:21.402 --> 39:24.971
Plus, I'm not exactly
a California girl.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.799
I don't really know
what that means,

39:26.799 --> 39:31.281
but, I mean, you seemed
pretty serious about it to me.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.458
There's other schools
with sustainability stuff.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.417
Plus, I would miss
Italian beef too much.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.985
And, you know,
and maybe you.

39:38.985 --> 39:41.422
You know what?
I'd miss you too.

39:41.422 --> 39:46.384
But the right school
is the right school.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.429
Why go so far
and leave you all alone

39:48.429 --> 39:50.257
when I have great options
at home?

39:50.257 --> 39:52.694
OK, first of all,
I'm not gonna be all alone.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.000
And guess what?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.742
It's actually not your job
to worry about me.

39:56.742 --> 40:01.355
Anna, when you've accomplished
what you have in school,

40:01.355 --> 40:04.358
you get to go
to whatever school you want to.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.447
I don't care where it is.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.797
And honestly, I've really
started to kind of look forward

40:08.797 --> 40:11.017
to having an excuse to go
to California in February.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.540
So, you know,
don't step on my dreams.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.630
Thank you, Dad.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.197
I'm gonna apply.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.591
Why not?

40:19.591 --> 40:21.201
Yeah.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.943
Let's see.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.727
OK.

40:27.555 --> 40:29.818
All set.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.907
Is that all right?
Are you in any pain?

40:31.907 --> 40:33.866
No, it's fine. Thanks.

40:33.866 --> 40:36.521
OK.

40:36.521 --> 40:40.873
Front door sticks, so just
lift up when you close it.

40:40.873 --> 40:42.701
I know it's late.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.442
Actually, I'm a--

40:44.442 --> 40:46.139
I'm a bit of a night owl.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.663
Occupational hazard
of being an OB-GYN:

40:48.663 --> 40:49.838
always on call.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.232
Oh, Hannah,
you don't have to stay.

40:52.232 --> 40:53.494
There is a quiz in here,

40:53.494 --> 40:56.410
and I have always
wanted to know

40:56.410 --> 40:59.979
which classic car matches
my sparkling personality.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.415
Oh, easy.

41:01.415 --> 41:04.113
You're a Prius.
