WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.959
Previously
on "Time After Time"...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.221
So, why did you summon me?

00:04.265 --> 00:06.876
Everything we want
is under one roof --

00:06.919 --> 00:08.878
Wells, John,
and the time machine.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.097
What do I have to do?

00:10.140 --> 00:13.056
Who created
Project Utopia?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.797
His name was Dr. Monroe.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.799
Brooke is continuing
her father's research.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.279
They figured us out.
We have to move now.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.845
When Brooke
gets the time machine,

00:19.889 --> 00:21.282
then you and I can go
back to our lives.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.761
You're insane.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.372
You're not taking
the time machine.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.680
Don't worry.
This isn't over.

00:30.987 --> 00:33.294
Why did you take Vanessa?
That was never part of the plan.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.078
When and where do you
want to make the exchange?

00:35.122 --> 00:37.080
I'll call you back
with more details.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.690
So, you're going to
continue to help us.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.867
It appears our goals
are aligned.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.880
Keep an eye out
for Brooke's men.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.016
Check every room.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.411
It's empty.

01:03.454 --> 01:04.542
All clear.

01:04.586 --> 01:05.761
Let's go.

01:05.804 --> 01:07.154
Lead the way.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.298
It's in here.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.058
What is this place?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.930
This is where Brooke
creates her little monsters.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.935
Had me strapped
to that table.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.854
What was she doing
down here?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.073
Oh, all sorts of fun things.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.208
The place is empty.
It's like Griffin's place.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.384
No sign Vanessa
was ever here.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.516
Damn it.
Where did they take her?

02:18.312 --> 02:20.052
Welcome home,
Dr. Monroe.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.663
Hello, Serena.
Hello, boys.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.665
I've set up a room
for your guest.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.362
Brooke,
you've gone too far.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.756
You need to stop this
before it's too late.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.761
The invincible
Vanessa Anders.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.546
Always so calm
and confident.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.549
It's nice to see you scared.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.203
You should be.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.465
Lock her up.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.467
Move.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.904
No.

02:45.948 --> 02:46.992
Let's go.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.223
She's wiped
her computer clean,

03:00.267 --> 03:02.747
and I couldn't recover
any of the deleted files.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.446
There must be something in here
that tells us where she is.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.230
She couldn't have
taken everything.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.797
She didn't have
enough time.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.583
I'm gonna check
upstairs.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.674
It's Martin.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.203
Hello, Martin?

03:23.246 --> 03:24.334
Is the time machine safe?

03:24.378 --> 03:25.988
I think so.
There's no one here.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.250
It's just me
and the machine.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.904
I need you to stay there.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.775
And I will call you once it's
safe to move the machine back.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.473
Yes, sir.
Of course.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.735
We'll speak soon.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.175
Where is the time machine?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.264
That is none
of your business.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.527
I don't trust him,
not for a second.

03:43.571 --> 03:44.485
I can hear you.

03:44.528 --> 03:45.573
Good.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.183
He should be locked up

03:47.227 --> 03:49.316
so we can focus
on finding Vanessa.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.232
Doug, I know how important
Vanessa is to you.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.798
She's important to me.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.192
But I do believe
that as long as John's

03:56.236 --> 03:58.455
selfish interests
are involved,

03:58.499 --> 03:59.761
he can be an asset.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.197
To properly interpret --

04:01.241 --> 04:03.504
H.G. needs someone
to do his dirty work

04:03.547 --> 04:05.897
while he professes
his ongoing sainthood.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.248
Oh, I wouldn't be
so sure of that, John.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.075
A man can be pushed
only so far.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.861
Don't you worry,
old friend.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.254
I'll push you along.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.081
I'll join Jane upstairs.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.658
Any word on Griffin?

04:27.702 --> 04:29.269
He hasn't called.

04:30.661 --> 04:31.706
Should we be worried?

04:31.749 --> 04:32.968
Not yet.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.709
I know my brother.
He'll show up.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.885
He's just trying
to make a point.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.713
What about
the time machine?

04:38.756 --> 04:40.802
Well, the good news
is I know it's in the city.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.238
The bad news
is I can't get

04:42.282 --> 04:43.935
an exact location
until it's turned on.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.546
I thought the virus
Griffin installed

04:45.589 --> 04:46.721
was supposed to locate it.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.070
When it's turned on, yes,

04:48.113 --> 04:49.593
but we can't control it
when it's idle.

04:49.637 --> 04:50.855
The second it starts up,

04:50.899 --> 04:52.770
the coordinates
should bring it right there.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.686
And the worst news --

04:55.730 --> 04:57.471
the virus scrubs clean
in 24 hours

04:57.514 --> 04:59.603
and we lose control
of the time machine.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.344
I'm looking into other ways
to locate it,

05:01.388 --> 05:02.867
but we don't have
a lot of time.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.306
Do you have
a secure phone?

05:08.482 --> 05:09.700
Thank you.

05:13.182 --> 05:16.185
Doug, how safe
is the time machine?

05:16.228 --> 05:17.665
It's in a warehouse
in the Bronx.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.841
And property records are hidden
under a subsidiary.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.625
The warehouse can't be traced
to Vanessa.

05:21.669 --> 05:22.931
Even still,
I feel someone

05:22.974 --> 05:24.324
besides Martin
should be with it.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.151
It's our best leverage
to win Vanessa back.

05:26.195 --> 05:29.111
I'll go with Jones.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.547
But I'm leaving Carl here
to watch John.

05:30.591 --> 05:34.769
And take this.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.292
What is it?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.902
John asked for a change
of clothes earlier.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.296
I placed a GPS tracker
in the lining of his pants.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.906
He has no idea
it's there.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.562
Now, this tells you exactly
where he is at all times.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.042
I have one of my own.

05:47.085 --> 05:50.219
What a wonderful
invention.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.134
I'll be on my cell.

05:56.965 --> 05:57.792
Did you find anything?

05:57.835 --> 05:59.228
Nothing.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.882
I thought
there would be something human

06:00.925 --> 06:02.884
about this woman
that would help us find her,

06:02.927 --> 06:04.146
but look at this place --

06:04.189 --> 06:06.017
it's cold,
it's impersonal.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.802
Brooke is a very
lonely woman.

06:07.845 --> 06:08.846
How can you tell?

06:08.890 --> 06:10.413
There are
no memories here.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.197
No pictures
or personal items.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.678
Something made her
that way.

06:14.722 --> 06:19.335
Clearly she and her brother
are motivated by pain and anger.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.164
To wage a plan so insidious,
you'd have to be.

06:22.207 --> 06:25.646
How did Vanessa
not know?

06:25.689 --> 06:28.300
How did I not know my friend
was a psychotic killer?

06:31.303 --> 06:34.394
I never dreamt him
capable of murder.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.614
How well
do we know anyone?

06:37.658 --> 06:40.574
I've only known you
for a short time,

06:40.617 --> 06:42.010
and I trust you.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.316
I certainly
don't trust John.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.666
Nor should you.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.276
Letting him roam free

06:47.319 --> 06:50.366
is clearly not one
of my smarter moves,

06:50.410 --> 06:53.978
but I feel
I must change course

06:54.022 --> 06:56.372
if I'm to survive
in this time.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.548
Change course how?

06:58.592 --> 07:01.421
This is no time
for virtuous ideology.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.814
If I am to win
Vanessa back,

07:03.858 --> 07:06.426
then I must do
whatever is necessary.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.953
It won't come to that.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.303
I pray you're right.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.274
Hello?

07:29.318 --> 07:31.015
Oh, John.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.235
Enjoying my home
without me?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.367
What are you
doing there?

07:35.411 --> 07:36.760
Looking for you,
my dear.

07:36.804 --> 07:37.892
Mm.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.328
And the esteemed
Mr. Wells?

07:39.371 --> 07:42.113
No, actually I have a few
questions of my own first.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.375
What is Project Utopia?

07:43.419 --> 07:45.900
And why is my DNA
at the core of it?

07:45.943 --> 07:48.642
And how on Earth did that DNA
make its way to 1980?

07:48.685 --> 07:50.600
Well,
that's a lot of questions.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.080
You've given me
an endless supply.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.516
What if I told you

07:53.560 --> 07:56.432
that it's a secret
of epic proportions?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.695
I would say I'm not
in the mood for games.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.784
Aw, that makes me sad.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.351
Well, what makes me sad
is the fact

08:02.394 --> 08:04.179
that you can't answer
a simply bloody question.

08:04.222 --> 08:07.748
Tell Wells that if he wants
to see Vanessa alive again,

08:07.791 --> 08:10.925
that I'll need the time machine
and the both of you.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.796
I don't give a toss
what happens to Vanessa.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.711
What does Project Utopia
have to do with me?

08:14.755 --> 08:17.540
I will kill her, John.
Tell Wells.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.020
No, you won't.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.891
If you wanted to do that,
you'd have done it already.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.505
He just had to have
the last word.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.723
Is everything okay?

08:26.767 --> 08:30.422
It will be.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.424
Just focus on locating
the time machine.

08:32.468 --> 08:34.514
I'll have John and Wells
soon enough.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.646
Guess we should let Wells
know we heard

08:36.690 --> 08:38.909
from the darling
Miss Monroe.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.002
Did you hear that?

08:45.046 --> 08:46.613
Yeah, I did.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.411
What was that?

09:17.644 --> 09:19.428
Ah!

10:09.043 --> 10:10.522
Hey, come with me.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.147
Where to?

10:26.190 --> 10:29.890
Come on.
I'm taking you to Brooke.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.642
I need some good news,
Serena.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.252
The time machine's
still of the grid.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.297
I'll let you know
as soon as I have something.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.516
All right.
Thanks.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.480
Hello, Vanessa.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.747
It's nice here,
isn't it?

11:00.790 --> 11:03.793
It was my father's
childhood home.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.361
We used to come here
when Griffin and I were little.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.145
It's not very smart
bringing me here.

11:08.189 --> 11:11.148
My father lost the property
years ago

11:11.192 --> 11:13.411
when he lost his career.

11:13.455 --> 11:17.633
I bought it back recently,
but it's not in my name,

11:17.677 --> 11:21.071
so no one can connect me
or Griffin to it.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.725
Where is Griffin?

11:22.769 --> 11:26.468
It doesn't matter.
He's not gonna help you.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.427
So, you're the one
in charge?

11:31.212 --> 11:32.343
I had to be.

11:35.042 --> 11:38.175
Griffin is ruled
by his emotions.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.830
He actually cares
about you.

11:40.874 --> 11:44.529
I don't bother
with too many feelings.

11:46.749 --> 11:50.971
You know, it's easier that way,
when your parents die.

11:51.014 --> 11:54.278
Mine died
when they were young, too.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.237
A child all alone.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.326
You learn
to put up walls.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.024
Sometimes that loneliness
is unbearable.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.421
I'm sorry,
is this the girlfriend

12:06.464 --> 12:09.032
part of the conversation
where we open up and share?

12:11.078 --> 12:13.210
Do you have any idea
what your father did?

12:13.254 --> 12:15.212
I know that my father
stole Project Utopia

12:15.256 --> 12:17.127
and used it to build
Anders Enterprises.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.826
He didn't just steal it.
He killed for it.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.045
I don't condone
what my father did,

12:22.089 --> 12:23.046
but it's done.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.874
What do you want from me?

12:24.918 --> 12:28.356
My company?
My money? What?

12:28.399 --> 12:30.750
My father
was a brilliant scientist.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.665
His research
would've changed the world.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.712
David Anders stripped
his life's work

12:36.756 --> 12:40.455
down to some generic
mood stabilizers to make money.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.022
Why didn't your father
come forward?

12:42.065 --> 12:43.023
Why didn't he expose him?

12:43.066 --> 12:46.156
Because he died.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.550
And Project Utopia
was never fully realized.

12:48.593 --> 12:49.681
But it's done.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.119
Brooke, I know
you want revenge,

12:52.162 --> 12:54.425
but you can't let it
consume you.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.557
It's the past.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.256
Nothing is in the past,
Vanessa.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.824
Not when you have
a time machine.

13:01.868 --> 13:05.480
You can't change the past.
It's too dangerous.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.613
I'm not gonna change it.
I'm going to fix it.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.659
Everything your family
took from us,

13:10.702 --> 13:12.139
I'm going to take it back.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.836
You can't play with time
like that.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
Yes, I can.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.928
Because I know
exactly how to do it.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.369
This journal...

13:25.413 --> 13:28.416
it's my father's.

13:28.459 --> 13:32.463
You see,
none of this was my plan.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.944
It's all my father's.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.211
Here, hold this.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.909
Just keep pressing on it
until the bleeding stops.

13:42.952 --> 13:43.910
Thanks.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.354
What are you
gonna do to him?

13:53.397 --> 13:56.183
Whatever I have to
to get him to talk.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.881
Will he? The man's been
genetically enhanced.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.361
I'm sure we'll find out.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.494
Is that what
Project Utopia is?

14:03.538 --> 14:05.888
A form of human
evolution?

14:05.932 --> 14:08.543
Brooke has all these papers
and books on neuroscience

14:08.586 --> 14:09.892
and genetic engineering.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.894
And in "The Island
of Doctor Moreau,"

14:11.938 --> 14:14.592
you wrote about a doctor's
unethical experiments.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.899
Cutting up animals
while they were still alive.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.901
Yes. Vivisection.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.164
It was a very controversial
subject in our time.

14:21.208 --> 14:25.168
Humans, animals,
gene splicing, stem cell,

14:25.212 --> 14:26.343
genetic manipulation.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.171
That's what Brooke
is doing here.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.131
These are the controversies
of this time.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.395
So, you owe
your esteemed career to Brooke?

14:34.438 --> 14:37.441
Themes of Darwinism,
man's ethical duty to science.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.835
Everything you wrote about
still applies today.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
So that is the basis
of Project Utopia.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.579
What about my DNA?
When did that happen?

14:44.622 --> 14:47.582
All I can offer is that
it hasn't happened yet.

14:47.625 --> 14:51.020
Well,
that boggles the mind.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.243
He's waking up.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.420
You might not want
to watch this.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.647
Well, look who finally
decided to show.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.739
Knew you bought
the old place.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.525
Didn't know you turned it
into a commune

15:17.568 --> 15:19.266
for your little freaks.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.615
Did you come here
to fight?

15:24.358 --> 15:25.489
No.

15:25.533 --> 15:26.882
Hm.

15:34.063 --> 15:38.154
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.286
I overreacted.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.810
I spent two years
with the woman.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.900
I got close to her,
and I lost my way.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.293
You were foolish.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.598
Yeah.

15:47.642 --> 15:50.558
Our lives...

15:50.601 --> 15:53.735
our reality
doesn't matter.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.998
When we get
the time machine,

15:56.042 --> 15:58.870
everything up to now
is going to change.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.439
I know that.
I was clouded.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.746
But I'm not anymore,
I promise you.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.488
This is all that matters.

16:10.230 --> 16:14.103
Brooke...

16:14.147 --> 16:16.714
you're my sister.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.151
You're what matters.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.858
I don't suppose you want to tell
us where Brooke is, do you?

16:31.947 --> 16:33.296
Very well.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.037
As a test subject,

16:35.081 --> 16:39.085
I'm sure you're well acquainted
with all of this.

16:39.128 --> 16:42.044
I, however, am not.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.785
So you'll have
to help me out.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.266
Now...

16:49.530 --> 16:51.967
What does this do?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.490
Alex?

16:53.534 --> 16:56.406
You are Alex, correct?

16:56.450 --> 16:57.625
Well, Alex.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.541
It's, uh, nice to have
a name with the face.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.064
What about this one?

17:05.763 --> 17:07.461
I'm not telling you
anything.

17:17.471 --> 17:18.646
You know
what you're doing?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.256
I know that Alex's body
is filled

17:20.300 --> 17:23.390
with chemical enhancements,
which he's dependant on.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.445
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.666
Where is Brooke?

17:38.709 --> 17:40.885
I can't tell you.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.718
What were you
supposed to do with us?

17:50.286 --> 17:52.245
Take you both to Brooke.

17:52.288 --> 17:53.898
Not kill anyone.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.509
You got in the way.

17:55.552 --> 17:58.077
Where is Brooke?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.296
I can't tell you.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.085
Mr. Wells,
what would you suggest?

18:06.128 --> 18:10.089
Give him more.

18:13.353 --> 18:16.269
I do believe
you've well and truly

18:16.312 --> 18:18.749
stepped into the world
of gray.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.926
Aah!

18:38.421 --> 18:40.162
Are you okay?

18:40.206 --> 18:43.470
What happened down there?

18:43.513 --> 18:47.996
I just helped
torture a man.

18:48.039 --> 18:51.260
Did he talk?

18:54.263 --> 18:56.961
You're just trying
to save Vanessa.

18:57.005 --> 19:00.269
That doesn't justify it.

19:00.313 --> 19:03.533
You're a good man.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.322
Did you find anything?

19:10.714 --> 19:14.849
There's no real info online,
so I started thinking.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.416
Griffin was
in the military.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.200
Maybe his father
was in the military too.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.636
It's very common.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.769
So I called Doug, and he
went through his contacts.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.553
And it turns out
Dr. Edward Monroe

19:23.597 --> 19:26.165
used to work
for the Department of Defense.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.255
These are the classified reports
from the Department of Defense.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.126
They've been sealed
since the '80s.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.128
Her father created
Project Utopia.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.347
But it was shut down.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.784
The Department of Defense
funded his research,

19:36.827 --> 19:38.525
and according to this report,

19:38.568 --> 19:40.309
it was deemed dangerous,
unethical,

19:40.353 --> 19:42.398
and morally reprehensible.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.707
Something's wrong.
Alex hasn't checked in yet.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.100
Managed to zero in on the
location of the time machine.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.014
It's somewhere
in the Bronx.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.233
Great.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.626
But the clock is ticking.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.323
How much longer
till you pinpoint it?

19:54.367 --> 19:56.107
Minutes.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.027
And you are...?

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
Rick.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.595
I'm Griffin.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.380
Brooke's brother.
I know.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.559
So, uh, Vanessa.
She's in the basement?

20:12.602 --> 20:14.256
Brooke made it clear
you're not to see the woman.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.562
No, no.
No, I know.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.286
It's okay.
I'm here to help you.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.070
What did you do to him?

20:46.114 --> 20:47.158
Ricin.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.291
Poison?
You killed him?

20:49.335 --> 20:51.511
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.650
We got to move fast,
before he's missed.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.304
Why did you kill him?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.132
These people Brooke has here,
they're not normal.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.134
I'm no match for them.
I had to take him out.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.267
You were never
supposed to be hurt, Vanessa.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.181
Griffin, you have done
nothing but lie to me.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.357
I can't explain myself.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.446
Just know I'm gonna
get you out of here.

21:13.489 --> 21:14.534
You sister is insane.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.275
We don't have time
for this.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.494
When Brooke knows I've betrayed
her, she will kill us both.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.192
Now, I need you to do
exactly what I tell you.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.369
There's a back door.
I have the key.

21:23.412 --> 21:26.285
I'm gonna go around.
When it's clear, I'll open it.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.331
We have to stop Brooke.
She can't get the time machine.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.246
She already has it.
Don't you see?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.030
You're expendable
to her now.

21:33.074 --> 21:34.597
-It's here?
-Not yet.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.643
But she knows
where Wells hid it.

21:36.686 --> 21:39.776
Soon as he turns it on,
she'll be able to control it.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.691
How can she control it?

21:41.735 --> 21:44.346
Forget the time machine.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.130
This is about getting you
out of here alive.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.349
Griffin.

21:49.003 --> 21:52.615
Wait over here for now.
Watch it.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.444
I know
you don't believe this,

21:55.488 --> 21:58.099
but I do love you,
Vanessa.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.855
Have you seen Rick?

22:14.898 --> 22:17.423
Nope. Sorry, pal.

22:22.645 --> 22:23.820
You found it?

22:23.864 --> 22:24.821
It's in a warehouse
in the Bronx,

22:24.865 --> 22:26.257
but I'm not picking up
a signal.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.346
I can't get
control of it yet.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.478
Then we'll get them
to turn it on.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.788
Hello, Wells.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.137
Miss Monroe.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.009
Unfortunately,
your little monster, Alex,

22:39.053 --> 22:40.620
couldn't complete his task.

22:40.663 --> 22:41.882
Where is he?

22:41.925 --> 22:44.406
He's here with us.
Care to trade?

22:44.450 --> 22:47.235
You can have him.
I have an alternate plan.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.106
Which is...?

22:49.150 --> 22:51.195
Find the time machine,
and I have.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.937
It's in a warehouse
on Rove Street in the Bronx.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.635
Sloppy, Wells.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.985
And the minute I get my hands
on it, Vanessa is dead.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.466
Calling Martin now.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.872
Come on.
Come on.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.356
We're entering
the ballroom now.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.184
Okay.
I'll send it back.

23:23.227 --> 23:25.055
You need to get it
out of her now.
Uh, where?

23:25.099 --> 23:26.840
Back to Vanessa's house.
Wells is waiting for it.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.450
Go!

23:39.026 --> 23:40.593
It's coming back now.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.770
You did it.
They're powering it up.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.431
Unknown caller.
Hello?

23:52.474 --> 23:53.432
Jane.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.171
Vanessa.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.303
Listen.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.391
Vanessa,
are you all right?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.479
Whatever Brooke told you
is a trick.

23:57.523 --> 23:58.741
Don't move the time machine.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.526
Brooke has figured out
a way to hijack it.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.144
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.624
Back safe and sound.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.494
Where are you?

24:12.538 --> 24:13.800
No.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.715
-H.G.? Jane? Jane?
-Hey! Get off --

24:18.108 --> 24:19.545
It's gone.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.372
Vanessa?

24:21.416 --> 24:23.244
Vanessa?

24:23.287 --> 24:25.942
Well, that didn't work,
did it?

24:30.425 --> 24:32.558
Told you I had this.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.219
No, no, no.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.264
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.317
You can come out now.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.844
Come on out.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.020
I promise nothing
is going to happen.

25:00.063 --> 25:02.936
Where's Vanessa?

25:02.979 --> 25:05.982
She's here.
I'll take you to her.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.028
Come on.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.560
I don't want any trouble.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.562
Serena?

25:20.606 --> 25:22.172
This way.

25:42.628 --> 25:43.933
Hello.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.066
What have you done?

25:46.109 --> 25:48.459
I've taken the time machine,
just like I said I would.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.113
Where's Martin?
Let us talk to him.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.898
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

25:51.941 --> 25:54.683
I just didn't see the point
of taking another hostage.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.076
She killed him.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.468
That's right, John.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.861
And Vanessa's next.

25:58.905 --> 26:02.038
So when can I expect
the pleasure of your company?

26:12.701 --> 26:14.485
She didn't
have to kill him.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.879
Oh, put a bloody sock in it,
will you?

26:16.923 --> 26:17.837
For goodness sake.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.142
What's done is done.

26:19.186 --> 26:21.188
He's a human being.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.972
He's just a kid.

26:26.062 --> 26:29.326
I'm responsible
for that man's death.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.415
Yes, you are.

26:34.114 --> 26:37.465
And what are you
going to do about it?

26:47.780 --> 26:51.000
Oh, don't stop now, H.G.
Come on, let us into your heart.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.654
Admit it,
you're out for blood.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.003
No.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.919
All that matters
is finding Vanessa.

26:56.963 --> 27:00.096
I'll surrender to Brooke.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.838
My life for her's.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.797
We need to find
that location from Alex.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.407
We've wasted
enough time trying.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.583
Well, then we will
try harder.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.977
And we will try
every vile trick in your book.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.631
That's funny.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.024
I was contemplating
a more compassionate approach.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.722
What are you talking about?

27:16.765 --> 27:19.463
Alex failed to get us
back to Brooke.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.683
You must feel terrible
about that.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.816
Wouldn't it just make
his day

27:23.859 --> 27:26.688
if I were to release him
from his bonds

27:26.732 --> 27:29.778
and tell him how he's going
to join Brooke's side?

27:29.822 --> 27:31.562
Why bother
with the ruse at all?

27:31.606 --> 27:34.217
Why not just switch allegiances
altogether, huh?

27:34.261 --> 27:36.089
I want to kill her,
not join her.

27:36.132 --> 27:38.091
You want to understand
Project Utopia.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.788
Brooke has the answers.

27:39.832 --> 27:42.486
And if she dies, Project Utopia
will never even exist.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.271
The answers
become irrelevant.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.534
Now, you've trusted me
this far.

27:46.577 --> 27:49.015
Yes, because our interests
were aligned.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.104
Yes, and they still are.

27:51.147 --> 27:54.411
H.G., if you surrender,
it's a fool's errand.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.849
She'll never make a deal
with you.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.720
If you want to save
Vanessa's life,

27:58.764 --> 28:01.114
you'll have to kill Brooke,
and you can't do that,

28:01.157 --> 28:02.898
not even now.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.074
But I will.

28:05.118 --> 28:08.730
And all of this goes away.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.558
So I send you
to do my bidding.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.734
It's why you've kept me around,
isn't it?

28:23.484 --> 28:24.833
Where's John?

28:24.877 --> 28:26.182
Gone.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.575
Alex is taking him
to Brooke's lair.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.229
You let him go?

28:29.272 --> 28:31.231
It was the only way to discover
where Brooke is keeping Vanessa.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.798
Well, we can't trust him
to do the right thing.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.364
I wasn't going to.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.760
You're tracking him.
Does he know?

28:38.804 --> 28:39.935
No.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.807
Doug planted the tracker
in his clothes.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.330
He has one, too.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.245
I need John,
and I want to trust him,

28:45.288 --> 28:46.463
but I won't give him

28:46.507 --> 28:48.422
another opportunity
to betray us.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.467
He's headed upstate.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.818
We shouldn't let him have
too much of a head start.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.171
It's working perfectly.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.955
I changed the program.
It's encrypted.

28:59.999 --> 29:00.739
It's all ours.

29:00.782 --> 29:01.914
Amazing.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.959
We have a problem.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.530
What the hell's going on?

29:09.573 --> 29:11.271
Seems your girlfriend here

29:11.314 --> 29:13.795
is more capable
than anyone ever imagined.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.449
What happened?

29:15.492 --> 29:17.320
She killed Rick.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.583
How did she do that?

29:19.627 --> 29:22.369
That's what I'd like to know.

29:26.721 --> 29:29.071
How is it that you managed

29:29.115 --> 29:32.596
to take out
one of my strongest men?

29:32.640 --> 29:35.774
You're the one
who said I was invincible.

29:38.211 --> 29:41.127
Do you know anything
about this, Griffin?

29:41.170 --> 29:42.606
What are you implying?

29:51.833 --> 29:53.792
Alex is here
with John Stevenson.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.489
John is here?
How did that happen?

29:55.532 --> 29:56.838
Alex brought him.
Keep up.

29:56.882 --> 29:57.752
And Wells?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.362
I'm sure
he's not far behind.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.495
Make sure she's secure
this time.

30:01.538 --> 30:02.713
Get up!

30:02.757 --> 30:03.802
Come on.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.194
Let's go.

30:12.854 --> 30:13.724
Are you okay?

30:15.248 --> 30:16.684
I'm glad you're okay.

30:16.727 --> 30:21.167
So, what possessed you
to come so willingly?

30:21.210 --> 30:23.343
I hear you're the new owner
of a time machine.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.922
He's been stationary
for several minutes now.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.488
This must be it.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.318
Okay.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.798
Let's see what
we're dealing with here.

30:43.842 --> 30:48.368
It's a 20-acre farm
100 yards ahead.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.370
It looks very isolated.

30:50.413 --> 30:54.069
Brooke could have who knows
how many men in there.

30:54.113 --> 30:57.812
If John has switched sides,
we're very much on our own.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.075
I know.
We should go by foot.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.729
We should hurry.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.123
You're not gonna ask me
to stay behind?

31:04.166 --> 31:05.428
No, I know better.

31:17.179 --> 31:20.008
You don't strike me
as the farm-house type.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.184
Really?
What type am I?

31:22.228 --> 31:24.491
Something with turrets.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.101
And a dungeon.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.323
So, is Vanessa dead?

31:30.366 --> 31:31.628
What do you care?

31:31.672 --> 31:33.456
Just making conversation.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.632
Now, you promised me
answers.

31:35.676 --> 31:38.070
You mentioned before
that your father

31:38.113 --> 31:40.028
was a scientist,
like you.

31:40.072 --> 31:44.990
Daddy worked for the government
doing biogenetic research

31:45.033 --> 31:50.038
to improve the performance
of soldiers on the battlefield.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.345
Project Utopia.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.042
Correct.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.827
And how do Wells and I fit
into your game of revenge?

31:56.871 --> 32:00.527
My father kept detailed records
in this journal.

32:00.570 --> 32:03.791
After he died,
it was passed on to me.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.576
You didn't answer my question.
How are Wells and I involved?

32:06.620 --> 32:09.492
Afraid I can't answer that.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.539
Because it hasn't
happened yet?

32:12.582 --> 32:14.541
Put that down.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.673
I just want to see
what's written.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.632
Hey, I thought
we were friends.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.808
All right, John,
enough small talk.

32:20.851 --> 32:23.463
But since this is not
going to end well for you,

32:23.506 --> 32:25.639
I think we should
just say goodbye here.

32:25.682 --> 32:28.903
What about our deal?

32:28.947 --> 32:32.080
I have you
and the time machine.

32:32.124 --> 32:35.997
Something tells me
Wells isn't far behind.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.433
Take him to the basement.

32:57.453 --> 32:59.151
Down the stairs.

33:22.870 --> 33:26.352
I am tempted to comment
on the irony of the situation.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.493
Where is H.G.?

33:37.537 --> 33:39.669
Nearby, I assume.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.846
Are you coming?

34:03.084 --> 34:04.694
This way.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.319
What are you doing?

34:20.362 --> 34:23.583
I'm gonna stop that crazy woman
from doing whatever she's doing.

34:23.626 --> 34:25.802
So, this was your plan.

34:25.846 --> 34:29.284
I knew you were up to something,
John, but hero?

34:29.328 --> 34:30.720
That's not you.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.766
Oh, no hero here,
Brooke.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.638
Just a man who stayed too long
at the party.

34:35.682 --> 34:39.251
Oh, where is it
that you want to go?

34:39.294 --> 34:41.601
Anywhere but here.

34:43.994 --> 34:46.736
Vanessa,
this is it, I'm afraid.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.826
You might want to run
right about now.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.045
Aah!

35:28.213 --> 35:28.952
Shh, shh.

35:28.996 --> 35:30.258
Don't move.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.999
Look, please don't hurt her.
It's me you want.

35:32.042 --> 35:33.522
Move.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.961
Well done, Alex.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.485
H.G.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.226
Brooke will want
to see them right away.

35:54.761 --> 35:57.981
We need to find Vanessa.
She's with John.

36:14.607 --> 36:15.999
Brooke.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.220
Are you okay?

36:19.264 --> 36:21.135
Yes. I'm fine.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.876
Where's the time machine?It's behind the barn.

36:22.919 --> 36:23.877
And John?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.009
I'm not sure,
but he helped me.

36:26.053 --> 36:29.099
We need to hurry.
Brooke has people everywhere.

36:34.975 --> 36:36.629
Hello, Mr. Wells.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.849
Drop the gun, Brooke.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.287
Is everybody trying
to be the hero tonight?

36:42.330 --> 36:43.897
They just want to leave.
Let them.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.421
You'd really shoot me.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.771
Your own family?

36:48.815 --> 36:52.340
It's not right,
what we're doing.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.603
It needs to stop.

36:54.647 --> 36:59.129
If you really feel that way,
then go ahead and kill me.

37:05.135 --> 37:07.442
Griffin! Griffin!
Griffin! Griffin!

37:07.486 --> 37:08.965
Oh, my God.

37:09.009 --> 37:10.619
Okay.
Where were we?

37:15.885 --> 37:17.104
Where's John?

37:17.147 --> 37:18.627
John's gone.
He won't be coming back.

37:18.671 --> 37:19.454
Did you hurt him?

37:19.498 --> 37:20.412
Do you care?

37:20.455 --> 37:21.630
What is this about,
Brooke?

37:21.674 --> 37:23.545
What is the point
of all of this death?

37:23.589 --> 37:25.243
It's about family,
Mr. Wells.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.722
You understand that,
can't you?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.594
You just killed
your only family.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.073
Wrong.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.554
These people you see here,
they're alive because of me.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.295
I made them who they are.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.123
You have me
and the time machine.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.646
Let Vanessa and Jane go.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.387
You don't get it, do you?

37:39.431 --> 37:41.650
None of this
really matters.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.391
It's all going to change.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.175
Boys, kill them both.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.742
No, no, no, no, no.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.397
Oh, my God!
Doug! Doug!

37:49.441 --> 37:50.572
They're getting away!

37:50.616 --> 37:52.748
We tracked you here.
Are you all right?

37:52.792 --> 37:53.706
I think so.

37:53.749 --> 37:54.837
Let's get you guys
out of here.

37:54.881 --> 37:55.273
No, I can't leave
the time machine.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.452
Doug, get Vanessa
to safety.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.018
Come with us.
No, no.
Go to the mansion.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.455
We'll see you there.
We'll meet you there.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.718
We got to go.
Let's go now.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.591
H.G., wait!

38:11.767 --> 38:14.117
What is this?

38:14.161 --> 38:17.469
Brooke's controlling
the time machine.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.602
H.G.!

38:20.646 --> 38:21.908
Brooke...

38:21.951 --> 38:23.301
If you harm her,

38:23.344 --> 38:25.128
you will never be able
to make me do anything.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.392
I know.
Now get in the time machine.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.743
Get in!

38:30.786 --> 38:33.485
Why?
Where am I going?

38:33.528 --> 38:36.618
You have to go back.
Exactly like it's written.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.054
What are you talking about?
What is written?

38:38.098 --> 38:40.666
I have my father's journal.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.668
I know what happens.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.452
And now I'm going
to change it.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.627
Change what?

38:45.671 --> 38:47.020
My life.

38:47.063 --> 38:50.545
Everything that happened,
I'm gonna rewrite it all.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.547
Now get in!

39:00.425 --> 39:01.251
Don't move.

39:06.169 --> 39:07.997
And if I do?

39:08.041 --> 39:09.782
I will shoot you, Brooke.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.392
I don't think you will.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.613
You're not a killer.
You don't have it in you.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.224
People change.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.313
Put the gun down, Wells.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.142
We both know
you won't pull that trigger.

39:24.797 --> 39:25.928
The time machine! Go!

39:32.326 --> 39:35.851
No.
I have to stop them.

39:35.895 --> 39:38.854
What's wrong?

39:38.898 --> 39:40.029
I have to stop them.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.422
Wells is going.
That's what you wanted.

39:41.466 --> 39:42.945
No, but Jane's not
supposed to be with him.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.341
What's happening?

39:47.385 --> 39:48.429
Something's wrong.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.998
She's not supposed to go.
She could ruin everything.
