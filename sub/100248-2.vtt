00:18.583 --> 00:21.291
- So, where are you taking me?
- It's a surprise.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.500
A surprise? What surprise?

00:23.583 --> 00:26.291
- I got you something.
-Do tell.

00:26.375 --> 00:29.541
Well, if I tell now,
it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

00:29.625 --> 00:32.083
You're a very, very naughty boy.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.166
Stand there. Close your eyes.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.333
Open.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.625
A daisy? Not a rose?

00:41.708 --> 00:44.125
-Roses are cliché.
-Daisies are cheap.

00:45.125 --> 00:48.083
I can still... kiss you, right?

00:56.458 --> 00:57.500
Where did it go?

00:57.583 --> 00:59.250
-What?
-My daisy.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.583
-Thought you didn't want it?
-Ugh!

01:14.166 --> 01:17.125
-Now it smells of pig shit.
-You been spying on us, you creep?

01:17.208 --> 01:19.250
'Course. Look at her.
No one's ever kissed that.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.333
Could she even stand up straight to do it?

01:21.416 --> 01:23.458
Where you going, crooked girl?
We can teach you.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.708
Leave me alone. Stop.

01:25.791 --> 01:27.666
I heard your father
makes you sleep with pigs.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.291
-Stop.
-Your own family doesn't even want you.

01:59.041 --> 02:02.291
-Who are you?
-Wha-- what is all this?

02:02.375 --> 02:03.625
Am I dead?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.000
How did I get here?

02:06.083 --> 02:08.291
Well, it looks to me
like you portalled in.

02:09.666 --> 02:10.750
I what?

02:11.375 --> 02:12.458
You know, portalled.

02:13.791 --> 02:16.625
From wherever you were to here.

02:16.708 --> 02:18.125
The Tower of the Gull.

02:19.125 --> 02:20.125
Aretuza.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.750
Oh, you're a virgin.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm sorry.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.750
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.458
Your backhand is even more impressive
than your magic.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.625
My what?

02:39.708 --> 02:42.041
<i>We're not supposed</i>
<i>to be out here...</i>

02:45.375 --> 02:46.916
-What's wrong?

02:53.125 --> 02:57.083
If you could conjure that portal
out of thin air, she'll be coming for you.

02:57.166 --> 02:59.583
She? She who?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.083
What are you doing?

03:15.416 --> 03:16.416
What's that?

03:17.583 --> 03:19.458
It's a-- a different kind of portal.

03:20.583 --> 03:21.916
One that can't be tracked.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.833
See, the one you made
has put a target on your back,

03:24.916 --> 03:26.333
but this will take you home.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.125
Look, you can trust me.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.458
What's your name?

03:32.541 --> 03:33.916
Istredd.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.041
-Wait. What's your--

03:51.791 --> 03:53.083
Get out of there, girl.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.458
-I-- I can do it.

04:26.458 --> 04:27.541
How much for a pig?

04:29.333 --> 04:31.083
They'll be at market tomorrow.

04:31.166 --> 04:32.458
Well, I'm here today.

04:34.750 --> 04:35.875
Ten marks.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.291
How much for this beast?

04:44.291 --> 04:45.708
-Six.
-Four.

04:46.541 --> 04:49.416
-What are you doing?
-Sold. Four marks.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.250
-Are you mad? You can't let them have her.
-As I said, sold. Four marks.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.875
The woman's a witch.
You know what they will do.

04:59.750 --> 05:02.333
-She's our daughter.
-She's no daughter of mine.

05:04.083 --> 05:07.583
Mother.  Please help me.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.208
Excellent. I'll be going.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.083
You can't take me!

05:18.791 --> 05:19.958
I won't go.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.333
Let me out!

05:32.500 --> 05:33.583
Let me out!

06:14.333 --> 06:15.708
Four marks.

07:18.791 --> 07:19.791
Princess!

07:21.250 --> 07:23.083
Princess Cirilla!

07:23.833 --> 07:25.333
Princess Cirilla!

07:25.416 --> 07:27.333
Come on! Now, Princess!

07:29.708 --> 07:31.666
-You, check down there.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.500
-Princess?
-Where are you, Princess?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.833
Princess Cirilla!

07:41.750 --> 07:43.041
Moving to the stream.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.250
-You, keep your eyes open!

07:45.958 --> 07:47.166
Princess Cirilla!

08:34.458 --> 08:35.458
Who's there?

08:44.333 --> 08:45.541
Stop right there.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.375
You mean they're poison?

09:15.041 --> 09:17.750
Oh, uh... no, thank you.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.083
I don't eat rat.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.250
Wait.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.166
Wh-Where in Cintra did you live?

09:37.625 --> 09:38.916
Where are your parents?

09:41.916 --> 09:42.958
Why don't you talk?

09:47.833 --> 09:50.000
I haven't spoken to anybody
in three days.

09:50.666 --> 09:51.666
I guess...

09:52.875 --> 09:53.875
I'm on the run.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.708
I'm supposed to be going towards someone,

09:59.791 --> 10:02.250
but instead,
I'm running from someone else.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.541
He has this...

10:15.541 --> 10:18.000
this big bird on his head.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.041
I don't know what he wants from me.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.750
We should smother the fire.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.083
I can't be caught by him.

10:35.166 --> 10:36.166
I can't.

11:29.416 --> 11:33.250
Look, it's the Cintran flag.
Come on, we're saved.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.750

12:29.375 --> 12:31.833
I'm so glad that I could
bring you all together like this.

12:31.916 --> 12:34.041
- Sit down and shut up!
-Unbelievable.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.958
I love the way you just...
sit in the corner and brood.

12:55.916 --> 12:58.791
-I'm here to drink alone.
-Good. Yeah, good.

12:58.875 --> 13:03.000
No one else hesitated to comment on
the quality of my performance, except...

13:04.250 --> 13:06.583
for you. Come on.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.916
You don't want to keep a man with...

13:09.000 --> 13:11.083
bread in his pants waiting.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.041
You must have some review for me.
Three words or less.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.416
They don't exist.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.791
What don't exist?

13:19.875 --> 13:22.416
The creatures in your song.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.666
And how would you know?

13:27.166 --> 13:29.625
Oh, fun. White hair...

13:30.375 --> 13:32.166
big, old loner, two very...

13:33.166 --> 13:35.208
very scary-looking swords.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.583
I know who you are.

13:40.791 --> 13:43.833
You're the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.125
Called it.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.625
A job I've got for ya. I beg you.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.958
A devil--
he's been stealing all our grain.

14:03.666 --> 14:06.541
In advance, I'll pay you.
A hundred ducat.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.750
One fifty.

14:15.708 --> 14:17.416
I've no doubt you'll come through.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.750
You take no prisoners, so I hear.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.750
Ah. Need a hand? I've got two.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.833
One for each of the, uh, devil's horns.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.166
Go away.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.375
I won't be but silent back-up.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.541
I heard your note, and, yes, you're right,

14:41.625 --> 14:44.208
maybe real adventures
would make better stories.

14:44.291 --> 14:47.791
And you, sir, smell chock-full of them.

14:47.875 --> 14:50.833
Amongst other things.
I mean, what is that? Is that onion?

14:50.916 --> 14:55.041
It doesn't matter. Whatever it is,
you smell of death and destiny.

14:55.125 --> 14:58.083
Heroics and heartbreak.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.208
It's onion.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.708
Right, yeah. Yeah.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.500
Ooh, I could be your barker,

15:03.583 --> 15:05.625
spreading the tales of Geralt of Rivia,

15:05.708 --> 15:08.333
the-the Butcher of Blaviken.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.291
-Come here.
-Yeah?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.916
Ho ho. Uhh.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Come on, Roach.

15:32.416 --> 15:35.125
Do you know how many people
wouldn't blink if you died?

15:42.416 --> 15:43.416
You get to live.

15:45.958 --> 15:46.958
Who are you?

15:48.583 --> 15:49.916
Tissaia de Vries.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.916
Rectoress of Aretuza.

15:56.541 --> 16:00.833
You should've let me die.
At least I had control over that.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.375
Oh, that's adorable, piglet.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.583
You weren't taking control.
You were losing it.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.458
Be in the greenhouse in 20 minutes.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.416
- <i>I sense your terror.</i>

16:21.375 --> 16:23.541
<i>And you are right to be afraid.</i>

16:37.625 --> 16:41.375
Chaos is the most dangerous thing
in this world.

16:42.333 --> 16:46.416
It is all around us all the time.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
Volatile and powerful.

16:49.666 --> 16:52.875
But... each one of you

16:52.958 --> 16:55.166
showed an aptitude for channeling it.

16:56.375 --> 17:00.083
Your conduit moment
created a new ripple in chaos,

17:00.166 --> 17:02.208
reaching me here in Aretuza.

17:03.125 --> 17:07.166
Anica, you saved a drowning boy
with your mind.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.416
Fringilla froze a cat.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
On accident.

17:14.875 --> 17:18.750
Sabrina... turned her mother fat.

17:20.833 --> 17:25.375
But just because
you are conduits of chaos...

17:26.166 --> 17:30.791
does not mean
that you are capable of magic.

17:31.791 --> 17:32.875
I want to go home.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.458
This is your home.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.750
Listen closely.
Your survival depends on it.

17:43.250 --> 17:46.541
Magic is organizing chaos.

17:47.333 --> 17:50.333
And while oceans of mystery remain,

17:50.416 --> 17:54.833
we have deduced
that this requires two things.

17:57.708 --> 18:00.875
Balance and control.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.750
Without them, chaos will kill you.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.208
This is the simplest of trials

18:09.291 --> 18:11.625
to see whether
you are worthy of the ascension.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.416
Between your flower and your stone
lies the balance.

18:17.375 --> 18:20.166
Lift your stone without touching it.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.833
Use the incantation .

18:35.583 --> 18:38.000
- I'm doing it.
-Your hand...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.625
This is the balance.

18:48.541 --> 18:51.125
Demonstrated beautifully.
Thank you, Fringilla.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.333
There is no conjuring something
from nothing.

18:54.958 --> 18:56.916
There is a give and a take.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.208
<i>-</i>You've lost a lot of blood, piglet.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.750
Sometimes a flower is just a flower...

20:08.666 --> 20:11.000
and the best thing it can do for us
is to die.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.333
Istredd.

20:51.958 --> 20:54.333
You were right. She found me.

20:55.291 --> 20:56.583
And you found me.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
My name.

21:01.208 --> 21:02.208
It's Yennefer.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.791
It's good to meet you properly...

21:08.958 --> 21:10.000
Yennefer.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.291
Hey, no cutting.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.375
Don't touch me.
This food was provided by the queen.

21:58.458 --> 21:59.708
May she rot in hell.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Your cloak...

22:04.166 --> 22:05.625
My father made it.

22:05.708 --> 22:09.125
Ziven Ozol. He clothes Cintra's finest.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.375
You look like you've been through hell.

22:15.291 --> 22:16.291
Like all of us.

22:25.958 --> 22:27.291
They're elf ears.

22:30.041 --> 22:31.041
I killed them all.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.458
Doing my part to avenge human lives lost
in Filavandrel's uprising.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.625
Filavandrel?

22:38.708 --> 22:40.166
The elves call him "King."

22:41.125 --> 22:43.625
Last year, he tried to claim Cintran land.

22:43.708 --> 22:45.833
My brother got an arrow in the brain.

22:47.416 --> 22:49.666
Every day, I make sure
his death's not in vain.

22:53.791 --> 22:54.916
Come. Meet my family.

23:07.666 --> 23:08.666
Come.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.916
Mother, I brought someone to join us.

23:13.791 --> 23:14.875
This is...

23:16.333 --> 23:17.333
Fiona.

23:17.916 --> 23:19.833
Look at you in your little cloak.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.166
Our father just died.

23:22.958 --> 23:26.666
Fighting to defend that wretched bitch
and her wretched family.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.791
Mother, stop.
It wasn't Queen Calanthe's fault.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.625
Nilfgaard only got past Cintran borders
because of elven spies.

23:32.708 --> 23:34.583
Technically, it was the elves' land first.

23:34.666 --> 23:36.083
-Our brother died for that land.

23:36.166 --> 23:39.041
And your father died
for Calanthe's selfishness.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.208
One conflict after another.

23:41.291 --> 23:44.625
Robbing us of our homes,
our men, and our lives.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.250
-When will it stop?
-When I'm a knight.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.166
I'll have enough coin
to rebuild our house.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.541
You're to be a knight?

23:50.625 --> 23:53.791
I have to apprentice,
but I'll be ready when Cintra rises again.

23:56.666 --> 23:59.458
To order and dignity.

24:00.625 --> 24:03.000
Oh, child. Your shoes.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.375
Let's get you a fresh pair, why don't we?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.583
That'd be wonderful. Thank you.

24:11.041 --> 24:12.166
Abbott.

24:33.416 --> 24:35.541
Don't worry. He's one of the clean ones.

24:42.875 --> 24:46.125
Reading between the lines
and the gut punches, chum,

24:46.208 --> 24:49.791
I'd say you have got
a bit of a... an image problem.

24:50.416 --> 24:52.958
Were I to join you on this...

24:53.041 --> 24:55.083
feat to defeat the devil of Posada,

24:55.166 --> 24:57.291
I could relieve you of that title.

24:58.291 --> 25:01.333
All the North would be too busy
singing the tales of...

25:01.416 --> 25:05.791
Geralt of Rivia,
the-the White Wolf or-or something.

25:06.541 --> 25:07.625
Butcher is right.

25:09.166 --> 25:11.375
Mind if I hop up?
I'm not wearing the right footwear.

25:11.458 --> 25:13.208
-Don't touch Roach.
-Yeah, right, yeah.

25:18.625 --> 25:22.500
The elves called this Dol Blathanna
before bequeathing it to the humans

25:22.583 --> 25:26.791
and retreating into their golden palaces
in the mountains.

25:27.500 --> 25:31.000
There I go again,
just... delivering exposition.

25:32.875 --> 25:33.875
Geralt?

25:34.708 --> 25:37.041
Geralt? Wh-Where are you going?

25:37.708 --> 25:39.208
Geralt, don't leave me.

25:40.208 --> 25:41.208
Hello?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.458
-What are we looking for again?
-Blessed silence.

25:46.166 --> 25:49.875
Yeah, I don't really go in for that.
Have you ever hunted a devil before?

25:50.375 --> 25:52.208
-Devils don't exist.
-Right.

25:53.458 --> 25:57.750
Obviously. Then, uh...
then what are we doing?

25:58.791 --> 26:02.458
Sometimes there's monsters,
sometimes there's money.

26:03.583 --> 26:04.666
Rarely both.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.583
That's the life.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.666
-Shit!

26:10.750 --> 26:12.833
Act Two begins!

26:12.916 --> 26:16.416
What was that?
Looks like a tiny cannonball from a...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, my gosh.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.916
Geralt... it is a devil.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.333
Ohh.

26:35.416 --> 26:38.416
-I have to see this magical, this mythi--

26:55.250 --> 26:57.458
-Leave me be!

27:01.000 --> 27:03.541
-You talk.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.041
Of course I talk!

27:07.125 --> 27:09.541
What happened with you?
Your mother fuck a goat?

27:09.625 --> 27:13.708
I am Torque the Sylvan,
a rare and intelligent creature!

27:13.791 --> 27:15.791
You're a dick. With balls.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.458
Balls I got from humans,

27:17.541 --> 27:20.500
who left our food filled with iron
meant to poison me!

27:20.583 --> 27:24.208
-Ow!
-Did your mother fuck a snowman?

27:27.166 --> 27:29.166
You are intelligent, I'll give you that.

27:30.125 --> 27:32.833
So I won't kill you,
but you can't stay here.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.083
Neither can you.

27:38.375 --> 27:40.208
Look into her eyes.

27:42.416 --> 27:45.375
Look until a door becomes a window.

27:46.375 --> 27:50.791
Seek to understand
your partner's greatest fears.

27:52.458 --> 27:53.458
With our eyes?

27:54.125 --> 27:56.291
No, piglet. With chaos.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.000
Thought transference
should flow through you,

28:00.083 --> 28:03.458
like learning to dance or swim or kiss.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.708
Come on, you can do it.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.833
<i>...drowning...</i>

28:49.625 --> 28:51.375
Anica's worst fear is snakes.

28:58.791 --> 28:59.791
Come here.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.166
You take weeks to lift your stone.

29:12.916 --> 29:14.416
You can't bend water.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.500
You struggle to perform
the simplest physical tasks.

29:19.666 --> 29:21.666
And now you lie to me?

29:23.375 --> 29:25.250
Your worst fear makes such sense.

29:26.875 --> 29:30.708
Even if you were a beauty,
still, no one would love you.

29:36.750 --> 29:37.833
Tissaia's right.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.875
I've been here for weeks
and can barely do shit.

29:45.291 --> 29:49.208
See, my thought transference trial
at Ban Ard took... three days.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.125
Boy I was paired with
had a phobia of cheese.

29:54.208 --> 29:56.916
I want to be good. Good at something.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.041
You'll get there.

30:02.458 --> 30:03.375
I didn't give up.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.708
Now I can read minds.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.541
Great. Is that what you're doing?

30:17.916 --> 30:20.500
You can read me, if you like.

30:30.125 --> 30:32.208
-I don't think it's working.
-You can see.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.250
You can see.

30:35.666 --> 30:36.666
Just...

30:39.583 --> 30:41.416
Just look past.

30:54.875 --> 30:55.875
I see them.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
What are they?

31:05.291 --> 31:06.333
Moon jellyfish.

31:09.666 --> 31:11.166
I... I can hear them.

31:13.375 --> 31:14.875
Cicadas in summer.

31:21.791 --> 31:22.833
I can taste it.

31:23.666 --> 31:25.416
-Hmm.

31:30.625 --> 31:31.833
It's warm bread.

31:39.958 --> 31:41.791
Are these the things you love?

31:43.958 --> 31:46.208
These are the things
I thought you would love.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.583
So tired.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.708
But I can't sleep, either.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.708
You're still scared, aren't you?

32:18.625 --> 32:19.750
Well, you're safe now.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.166
I've got you.

32:27.583 --> 32:28.625
I'm looking for...

32:32.666 --> 32:33.916
for Geralt of Rivia.

32:36.375 --> 32:37.416
Do you know him?

32:38.291 --> 32:39.333
Afraid I don't.

32:43.750 --> 32:44.708
He's a knight?

32:47.208 --> 32:48.208
I don't know.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.541
What about your mother or your father?

32:55.458 --> 32:57.291
My parents died when I was a baby.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.416
My grandmother took care of me.

33:04.291 --> 33:05.291
Where is she?

33:12.625 --> 33:13.625
She, um...

33:15.291 --> 33:16.291
died.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.958
In the Nilfgaard attack.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.000
Oh. I'm so sorry.

33:32.458 --> 33:33.708
I'm sorry, too.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.583
For your family.

33:39.916 --> 33:41.583
We'll get through this together.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.666
We take care of our own.

34:09.791 --> 34:10.791
Get up.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.125
Welcome, Fringilla.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.041
Welcome, Lark.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.166
Welcome, Doralis.

34:28.875 --> 34:30.208
Welcome, Sabrina.

34:33.291 --> 34:36.041
And welcome back, piglet.

34:43.125 --> 34:46.625
Tor Lara, the Tower of the Gull.

34:47.625 --> 34:50.375
The most potent place on the continent.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.458
Off-limits,
except to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.333
Why?

35:01.041 --> 35:03.500
This trial tests your ability

35:03.583 --> 35:06.833
to control
the ultimate expression of chaos.

35:07.916 --> 35:10.791
Catch lightning in a bottle.

35:11.416 --> 35:14.666
-That's impossible.
-No, it's magic.

35:17.333 --> 35:18.333
Doralis.

35:27.583 --> 35:28.583
Bottle up.

35:30.708 --> 35:31.916
Now.

35:45.333 --> 35:47.416
-She's still breathing.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.291
Lark, move Doralis aside.

35:52.625 --> 35:54.000
Anica, your turn next.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.250
Quickly.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.541
-You can do this.
- Quickly.

36:07.958 --> 36:08.958
I did it.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.250
-Piglet, your turn.

36:17.666 --> 36:18.791
Faster.

36:33.250 --> 36:36.416
Sabrina, show these girls how it's done.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.833
The strong amongst the weak.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.333
What you did there
was pathetic and dangerous.

37:30.125 --> 37:31.625
Felt pretty powerful to me.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.541
There are mages like Sabrina
who ignore their emotions.

37:37.791 --> 37:41.833
And then there are mages like us
who are consumed by them.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
Like us?

37:45.666 --> 37:48.833
Your first night here at Aretuza,
you tried to kill yourself.

37:49.791 --> 37:53.083
And tonight,
you almost killed someone else.

37:54.416 --> 37:57.750
It is your job to control chaos,
not become it.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.666
-I can.
-But if I send you to advise a king,

38:00.750 --> 38:03.458
and your precious little feelings get hurt
when he won't listen,

38:03.541 --> 38:07.625
and you submit to chaos,
he dies, his people turn on us.

38:07.708 --> 38:09.166
Whose fault would that be?

38:09.250 --> 38:10.250
-Mine.
-No.

38:11.041 --> 38:13.541
Mine for letting you ascend.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.250
-I understand.
-Do you?

38:20.750 --> 38:23.125
You lie. You keep secrets.

38:23.833 --> 38:26.791
You succumb to emotion, to weakness.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.958
Do you actually have what it takes?

38:50.958 --> 38:53.291
-This is the part where we escape.

38:53.375 --> 38:56.166
-This is the part where they kill us.
-Who's they?

38:58.208 --> 38:59.416
Beast!

39:00.333 --> 39:02.625
-Elves.
-Oi, that's my lute. Give that back.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.916
Quick, Geralt. Do your-your witchering--

39:05.000 --> 39:06.166
-Shut up!
-No.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.958
- You shut up!

39:08.041 --> 39:09.958
My Elder speech is rough.
I only got part of that.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.583
Humans, shut up.

39:11.666 --> 39:13.583
Ah, got it, thanks so much.

39:13.666 --> 39:16.041
-Do you wanna die right now?
-As opposed to later?

39:16.125 --> 39:18.250
-No, please, not the lu--
-Leave off!

39:18.333 --> 39:20.375
-He's just a bard.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.666
You don't deserve the air you breathe.

39:22.750 --> 39:25.250
-Everything you touch, you destroy.

39:31.875 --> 39:34.041
You hide in your golden palaces.

39:34.125 --> 39:38.666
You beat a bound man,
too scared to even look him in the eye!

39:38.750 --> 39:40.833
Do you like my palace? Hmm?

39:42.041 --> 39:45.125
Does it live up to the tales
you humans tell?

39:46.916 --> 39:49.083
-Yeah, take that, pointy.

39:54.708 --> 39:56.500
Wait, what's-what's wrong with her?

39:56.583 --> 39:58.791
-She's sick.
-Oh, and who's this?

39:58.875 --> 40:01.791
-He's Filavandrel, King of the Elves.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.958
Not a king. Not by choice.

40:05.041 --> 40:06.625
You were stealing for them.

40:08.166 --> 40:11.708
I felt for them.
They were forced out of Dol Blathanna.

40:11.791 --> 40:13.291
Forced out? No, they chose--

40:13.375 --> 40:17.458
Do you know anyone that would
choose to leave their home? To starve?

40:18.375 --> 40:20.250
To have a Sylvan steal for them?

40:22.041 --> 40:25.583
Toruviel, no one was supposed to get hurt.

40:25.666 --> 40:28.708
What's two humans in the ground
when countless elves have died?

40:28.791 --> 40:29.916
One human.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.958
And you can let him go.

40:33.041 --> 40:35.625
Then Posada will learn
that we've been stealing.

40:37.166 --> 40:38.458
The humans will attack.

40:39.666 --> 40:40.833
Many will die...

40:41.541 --> 40:43.041
on both sides.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.291
The lesser evil.

40:47.791 --> 40:49.458
No matter what you choose,

40:49.541 --> 40:52.458
you'll come out bloody
and hating yourself.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.583
-Trust me.
-That's the problem.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.041
I can't.

41:01.791 --> 41:03.125
This is necessary.

41:03.208 --> 41:04.708
I understand.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.916
As long as you understand...

41:08.791 --> 41:11.583
that it won't be long
before you follow me in death.

41:12.291 --> 41:15.625
Yes, because they pushed us
from viable soil.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.583
Even chaos is polluted.

41:19.416 --> 41:23.166
Synthetically enhanced
so humans can make magic.

41:23.958 --> 41:28.208
Chaos is the same as it's always been.

41:29.833 --> 41:32.041
Humans just adapted better.

41:32.125 --> 41:35.333
You say adapt, and I say destroy.

41:36.583 --> 41:39.291
You are choosing to starve.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.833
You're cutting off your ear
to spite your face.

41:43.916 --> 41:45.500
You think this is about pride?

41:47.750 --> 41:52.875
My elders worked with humans
and got robbed of all they had.

41:54.041 --> 41:56.500
And when they fought back,
they were slaughtered.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.250
"The Great Cleansing," humans call it.

42:04.166 --> 42:09.166
I called it digging a mass grave
for everyone I loved.

42:12.375 --> 42:16.416
And now the humans
proudly watch these very fields grow...

42:17.333 --> 42:20.875
our babies fertilizer for their grain.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.166
I don't wish to bury anyone else.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.958
I was once
Filavandrel of the Silver Towers.

42:33.625 --> 42:35.875
Now I'm Filavandrel
of the Edge of the World.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.666
If I bring my people down
from these mountains,

42:40.750 --> 42:43.708
it would mean
bowing to human sovereignty.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.916
They'll make slaves of us.

42:46.750 --> 42:48.791
Pariahs of half-blood children.

42:48.875 --> 42:52.041
Then go somewhere else.

42:53.291 --> 42:54.458
Rebuild.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.333
Get strong again.

42:58.458 --> 43:03.833
Show the humans that you are
more than what they fear you to be.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.416
Like you, Witcher?

43:10.458 --> 43:12.125
I have learned to live with them.

43:13.916 --> 43:15.208
So that I may live.

43:20.916 --> 43:22.583
Please, my King.

43:23.583 --> 43:26.416
There are others. A new generation.

43:27.208 --> 43:29.375
Evellien who wish to fight!

43:32.333 --> 43:34.166
Let us take back what's ours.

43:35.666 --> 43:36.708
Starting now.

43:41.625 --> 43:43.791
-Wait!
-Torque, stand aside!

43:45.541 --> 43:47.541
The witcher could've killed me.

43:48.666 --> 43:49.666
But he didn't.

43:50.708 --> 43:51.958
He's different.

43:52.750 --> 43:53.833
Like us.

44:01.041 --> 44:02.250
If you must kill me...

44:03.666 --> 44:04.708
I am ready.

44:06.625 --> 44:07.916
But the Sylvan's right.

44:10.291 --> 44:11.458
Don't call me human.

44:31.541 --> 44:33.541
She knows about us.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.500
I'm gonna be sent home.
We'll never see each other again.

44:37.166 --> 44:39.416
What do you mean,
we'll never see each other again?

44:40.083 --> 44:44.666
No, no. This-This is not the last time.
We-- We'll find a way.

44:44.750 --> 44:45.791
How?

44:46.541 --> 44:49.791
W-With one of those extra-special portals?

44:49.875 --> 44:51.291
Oh, look, you know--

44:52.166 --> 44:54.875
I wish I could show you,
but I-I can't risk the knowledge

44:54.958 --> 44:56.875
-reaching the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
-Why?

44:56.958 --> 45:00.708
It's not the method of magic we're taught.
It's older. It's more potent.

45:00.791 --> 45:02.791
It could open doors
that can't be closed again.

45:02.875 --> 45:04.125
I don't understand.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.000
My worst fear is true.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.791
I'm still not enough.

45:15.666 --> 45:16.666
Even for you.

45:21.250 --> 45:22.291
-Come.

45:23.958 --> 45:25.541
-I want to show you.

45:26.125 --> 45:27.125
Come.

45:37.791 --> 45:39.541
Do you know whose skulls these are?

45:42.916 --> 45:43.958
Dead people?

45:46.125 --> 45:47.083
Dead elves.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.291
These elves built Aretuza.

46:10.291 --> 46:11.458
You mean as slaves?

46:12.083 --> 46:14.041
No, no. This was before humans.

46:15.750 --> 46:18.208
Elves are the original sorcerers
of the continent.

46:21.208 --> 46:22.041
What?

46:22.708 --> 46:26.791
When humans and monsters all arrived
after the Conjunction of the Spheres...

46:27.458 --> 46:30.750
elven mages taught the first humans
how to turn chaos into magic.

46:32.541 --> 46:36.041
And then...
the humans slaughtered them...

46:36.958 --> 46:39.833
so they could pretend the power
had always belonged to them.

46:41.875 --> 46:44.000
Rewriting history
with the stories we tell...

46:45.083 --> 46:47.958
the songs we sing
about our own triumphs, it's what we do.

46:50.833 --> 46:52.166
But I want to honor them.

47:15.166 --> 47:18.041
Feainnewedd only grows
where elder blood has spilled.

47:24.833 --> 47:25.833
Open your mouth.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.916
How did-How did you do that
on your first try?

48:16.875 --> 48:18.541
-I should go.

48:18.625 --> 48:20.125
W-W-Wait-Wait.

48:20.208 --> 48:21.541
-Wait. Wait.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.333
Wait.

48:26.750 --> 48:27.750
My father...

48:30.375 --> 48:31.375
My real father...

48:32.875 --> 48:33.958
he was half-elf.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.041
Do you remember the Great Cleansing?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.458
-Thousands of elven lives lost.

48:46.083 --> 48:47.541
That's how my father died.

48:49.916 --> 48:53.916
His blood is... why I'm cursed
with a twisted spine.

48:59.833 --> 49:01.333
Why I'm only worth four marks.

49:05.416 --> 49:06.958
Why no one could ever love me.

49:27.375 --> 49:28.833
So far, so good.

49:39.500 --> 49:41.583
What will you do with it?

49:41.666 --> 49:42.791
Nothing.

49:43.416 --> 49:44.750
Simply wanted to know

49:44.833 --> 49:47.708
that you could control your emotions
and get it from the boy.

49:48.291 --> 49:49.583
That you would.

49:49.666 --> 49:50.791
You may go...

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Yennefer.

49:56.208 --> 49:57.958
Does this mean I get to ascend?

50:02.750 --> 50:03.750
I'm ready.

50:11.583 --> 50:12.750
Listen for the knock.

50:24.791 --> 50:26.875
You've been working on her for months.

50:27.791 --> 50:30.000
You must be able to give me something.

50:31.083 --> 50:32.625
Make Ban Ard proud.

50:38.791 --> 50:39.958
Sh-She's part elf.

50:53.291 --> 50:56.041
Nilfgaard! They're here! They're here!

50:56.125 --> 50:58.375
-What's happening?
-Go get the horse.

50:58.458 --> 51:00.583
Find Adon and Zeke. And take this.

51:03.291 --> 51:05.958
You stupid little shit!
Pick it up and go!

51:06.041 --> 51:07.125
-Go!

51:22.791 --> 51:25.208
Help!

51:30.500 --> 51:32.666
It's you. Wait.

51:45.375 --> 51:46.875
Go on!

52:13.750 --> 52:14.750
Anica.

52:31.916 --> 52:32.916
Doralis.

53:23.875 --> 53:25.583
Come forth, Yennefer.

53:37.458 --> 53:39.208
You turned my friend into a slug.

53:39.833 --> 53:40.875
An eel.

53:42.500 --> 53:44.833
Come. Push your friend into the pool.

53:46.083 --> 53:47.625
-No.
-Yes.

54:00.541 --> 54:03.250
I took away her control,
but she still has power.

54:08.791 --> 54:10.000
She's a conduit.

54:13.625 --> 54:14.666
For Aretuza.

54:22.458 --> 54:25.583
Sometimes the best thing
a flower can do for us is die.

54:33.750 --> 54:36.208
- Credit where credit is due.

54:36.291 --> 54:40.208
That whole reverse-psychology thing
you did on them was brilliant, by the way.

54:40.291 --> 54:42.416
"Kill me. I'm ready."

54:48.041 --> 54:49.500
That's the conclusion.

54:49.583 --> 54:53.541
They just let us go, and you give
all of Nettly's coin to the elves.

54:55.041 --> 54:57.791
Filavandrel's lute
not gift enough for you?

54:58.958 --> 55:00.875
Yeah, she is a bit sexy, isn't she?

55:02.000 --> 55:03.916
I do have respect for Filavandrel.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.333
He survived the Great Cleansing once.
Who knows? Maybe he can do it again.

55:09.708 --> 55:10.708
Be reborn.
