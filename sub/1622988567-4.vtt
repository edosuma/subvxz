WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:07.590
The Emergency comes from messages.

00:07.674 --> 00:11.720
KATE: Messages come from a transmitter
in a high place, like a tower.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.514
The only way into that tower
is as a Messenger.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.100
REYNIE: So, we just have to be
the best of the best,

00:17.183 --> 00:19.310
do well in our classes
and become Messengers.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.895
You may achieve Messenger status

00:20.979 --> 00:24.149
faster than any student
in our history, Reynie.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.484
Mr. Bloom? It's me, Reynie Muldoon.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.944
I have no idea who you are.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.946
He doesn't even remember his own name.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.741
-They erased his memory.
-Swept his mind.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.410
-STICKY: It's students' names.
-REYNIE: Rankings?

00:35.493 --> 00:37.245
KATE: Constance and I are in yellow.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.040
What happens to Charlie?

00:41.124 --> 00:44.335
So, if Constance and I
don't get our grades up, we're next?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.713
We have to make sure you don't get barged.

00:46.796 --> 00:47.672
Or worse...

00:47.756 --> 00:49.507
Kate and Constance, they're struggling.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.342
There is no room for error.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.678
Which is why we cannot let them fail.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.847
REYNIE: "Become what you are not."

00:55.930 --> 00:57.974
-KATE: What does that mean?
-He wants us to cheat.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.413
Oh.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.692
-It's unethical.
-I agree, but...

03:12.775 --> 03:14.360
How could he ask us to cheat?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.697
Sticky! Situational awareness, please.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.407
George is not like us.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.577
He can't control emotions
for tactical advantage.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.787
Does Benedict actually want us to cheat?

03:24.871 --> 03:28.333
Cheating comes with the territory
in the spy game. Tradecraft.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.753
If we get caught, our brains get erased.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.048
But if we don't cheat,
Kate and Constance get barged

03:35.131 --> 03:36.341
and their brains get erased.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.678
Maybe we don't have to cheat.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.559
That's the same journal
I saw him writing in before.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.479
Probably loaded with key intel.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.939
We get a peek inside that,

03:51.022 --> 03:53.733
we can end this thing right here,
right now.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.568
How are we supposed to do that?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.321
KATE: I've got it all figured out.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.325
I call it Behind the Curtain,
Assault Alpha.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.037
Diagrams and schematics to follow.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.223
NUMBER TWO: Wine-braised octopus.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.599
MILLIGAN: Hmm.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.894
Haven't seen you all morning.

04:29.978 --> 04:34.023
Ah, got up early to remove my braids.
Almost done.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.068
Crafting a new character
for some future undercover work.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.946
Her name is Demetra.

04:40.905 --> 04:44.534
Disgraced badminton star,
lots of baggage, ghosts.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.954
Why would we ever need you undercover
as a disgraced badminton star?

04:48.037 --> 04:50.248
Hmm. You don't know until you know.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.874
Why was she disgraced?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.543
Rather not talk about it.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.964
I mean, Rhonda would. She wouldn't.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.261
You're a bit sharper than usual, eh?

05:04.262 --> 05:05.513
RHONDA: Everything okay?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.765
I wouldn't know where to begin.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.062
A trace of Scotch bonnet.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.690
A whisper, not a shout.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.861
That foliage continues
to obscure my line of sight!

05:19.944 --> 05:21.863
I need a better vantage.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.621
Apologies. I'm a bit rattled.
I suppose we all are.

05:30.705 --> 05:31.831
I'm great.

05:31.914 --> 05:35.168
First, I ask them to go undercover
and risk their lives and now cheating?

05:35.251 --> 05:36.544
You know how that makes me feel.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.795
Nausea, regret.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.256
If I could track those divers
the children mentioned,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.091
it might provide some crucial detail.

05:42.175 --> 05:46.304
I need to get my eyes on that inlet
from somewhere up high.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.974
Widow's Peak. Three miles due north,
straight to the top.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.935
Offers a promising vantage point.
Treacherous hike though.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.854
That's perfect.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.564
And with the right telescoptics...

05:56.647 --> 05:58.274
A Dobsonian mounted reflector.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.068
Or maybe even a four-inch refractor, eh?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.445
Yes! We just might see something.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.614
Some clue to what my brother
is building in the water.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.032
Ah! We must leave at once!

06:06.741 --> 06:09.285
Excuse me! You're a wanted man.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.620
That's why we're in the woods,

06:10.703 --> 06:12.997
to avoid the people
who are coming after you.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.624
If you were to be spotted...

06:16.793 --> 06:18.169
Please let Milligan handle this.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.339
Fine.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.926
Can I at least help
with the lens modifications, Number Two?

06:34.102 --> 06:37.188
Have you noticed
that Number Two's been a bit distant?

06:38.439 --> 06:40.775
I prefer to remain neutral
on workplace matters.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.237
Fully respect that.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.503
-STUDENT 1: What's he doing?
-STUDENT 2: The man is journaling.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.630
Good afternoon, Dr. Curtain.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.677
Oh, Reynard Muldoon. Muldoon, Reynard.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.055
Do you ever notice you have
a perfectly balanced, well-syllabled name?

07:11.472 --> 07:13.724
Thank you. Sorry to interrupt.

07:14.559 --> 07:18.312
No, I welcome it, human interaction.
What can I do you for?

07:18.396 --> 07:22.859
Do you have a burning question
from our previous two-man conclave?

07:23.401 --> 07:25.528
Yes. Caesar salad.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.532
Always an intriguing first course, yes.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.829
And?

07:34.912 --> 07:40.084
Well, does making it table-side
actually improve the taste?

07:41.544 --> 07:45.214
Ah, well, um, a meal
isn't just about taste.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.801
It's presentation,
texture, auditory intrigue.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.970
It's like theater.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.347
Do you mind if I write that down, sir?

07:53.764 --> 07:57.518
No. Would you like a pen? There you are.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.612
STICKY: There she is.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.366
She has to stop moving.
I can't make anything out.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.660
Is... is that all?

08:15.995 --> 08:21.542
Well, I came over because I noticed that
your journal has a lot of dog-eared pages.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.169
Oh.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.922
I must say, that's a bit surprising.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.133
You're surprised that I have pages
to which I frequently refer?

08:29.217 --> 08:33.804
Oh, no, sir. I'm surprised that
no one has thought to offer you these.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.016
Bookmarks.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.978
Well, ribbons functioning as bookmarks.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.106
Oh. Well, thank you, Reynard.

08:45.024 --> 08:50.196
Constance, go tell Kate, "Move the mirror
seven centimeters southwest."

08:52.949 --> 08:55.034
-Thank you.
-REYNIE: Wait.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.413
Aren't you gonna put them in?

09:01.165 --> 09:02.208
Oh.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.879
Never defer happiness.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.095
The number two killer of journals
is dog-earing, they say.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.137
CURTAIN: Oh, wow.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.222
What?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.848
Who exactly says that?

09:18.516 --> 09:19.475
Everyone...

09:20.059 --> 09:21.811
-Oh.
-...back home.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.648
Uh, it's a regional-ism.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.984
STICKY: Come on, Reynie. Keep stalling.

09:28.067 --> 09:33.698
In fact, there's this one woman,
Izzy Paladonia, she's locally famous.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.951
And I assume she coined the maxim?

09:37.034 --> 09:40.871
Yes, yes.
She specializes in journal upkeep.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.251
-She's a master at calfskin revival.
-Calfskin...

09:45.334 --> 09:47.336
REYNIE: And people travel
from all around the world

09:47.420 --> 09:48.963
-to learn from her.
-CURTAIN: Do they?

09:49.046 --> 09:49.964
REYNIE: Yes.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.257
Left.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.386
REYNIE: And she's been gathering
a larger cult following.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.679
Really?

09:57.847 --> 09:58.848
STICKY: Got it.

10:02.685 --> 10:06.564
And that's Izzy Paladonia.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.566
That's Izzy Paladonia.

10:09.900 --> 10:14.363
Wow. Reynie, it is laudable
to have interests in our world,

10:14.905 --> 10:17.783
as esoterically ludicrous
as they may appear

10:17.867 --> 10:19.118
to almost everyone else.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.664
CURTAIN: Thank you for this.
This was, um, very kind.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.167
-Thank you.
-Yes.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.543
-Sir.
-Good day.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.794
Hmm.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.595
Man, that is impressive.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.015
I know a guy
who could do this in half of the time.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.266
You do not know a guy.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.185
Please, just let him focus.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.896
Focus isn't the issue. Artistic talent is.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.191
There's a diagram in here
and I can't draw to save my life.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.901
We could always steal another look.

10:51.984 --> 10:52.902
-No!
-No!

10:53.611 --> 10:54.612
All right.

10:55.237 --> 10:58.908
Almost done. And finished.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.954
Wow! This is...

11:04.038 --> 11:05.331
Garbage.

11:05.831 --> 11:06.832
Give me those.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.254
Backwards. Mirror image. VoilÃ .

11:12.338 --> 11:14.048
Oh, is this a deer?

11:14.632 --> 11:16.175
STICKY: It's supposed to be a shoe.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.512
-Maybe I've lost my touch.
-Your memory's photographic.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.306
It must be this cryptic
because it's important.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.016
He's hiding something for sure.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.559
There has to be something in there.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.270
Yes, but Kate and Constance
are running out of time.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.690
I have a lot of tests coming up.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.526
Then we have to focus on passing them

11:34.110 --> 11:36.737
by any means necessary.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.989
Any means.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.575
I'll help Constance in Mr. Oshiro's class.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.662
For you two, I'm thinking Morse code.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.081
Sticky, you can
softly tap out the answers.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.457
Are you out of your mind?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.168
It's not right.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.463
This can work.
You're the best with Morse code.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.425
And we believe in you.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.301
Speak for yourself.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.513
-

12:49.643 --> 12:51.270
NUMBER TWO: This is troubling.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.820
How could you do something so risky?
You could get caught.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.198
-Never happen.
-I caught you easily, really easily.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.116
You only caught me
because you followed me.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.202
Proving you can be followed,
and thus, my point.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.162
How often are you going on these outings?

13:08.245 --> 13:10.539
As often as needed, and not often enough.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.541
I get the risk.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.586
I don't think you do.
Given what's at stake in this mission,

13:15.669 --> 13:18.631
given what we're up against,
everything has to go towards that mission!

13:18.714 --> 13:20.800
-Yes, exactly!
-So, we agree.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.218
About this? No.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.596
You could expose our entire operation,
and for what?

13:25.679 --> 13:27.640
What does any of this lead to?

13:27.723 --> 13:29.975
I don't know. We'll have to see, eh?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.145
I know you mean well.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.523
-But this gesture...
-

13:35.606 --> 13:38.192
Think rationally, what does it change?

13:38.275 --> 13:40.361
Besides making you feel
like you're doing something.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.654
What's tangible?

13:41.737 --> 13:43.823
One small act leads to another,
and then another,

13:43.906 --> 13:46.075
and eventually becomes something bigger.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.077
Or maybe it doesn't.

13:48.953 --> 13:55.292
Either way, doing something,
anything, keeps me sane.

13:56.001 --> 14:00.047
Allows me to function. That's tangible.

14:01.215 --> 14:05.886
So, yes. I need to do this.
And you need for me to do it too.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.272
Why are you sweating?

14:16.730 --> 14:20.526
Shame. Guilt. Apprehension.
Take your pick.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.154
What if I fail?
I don't like letting people down.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.489
You won't.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.117
This is all really rough for me.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.745
Exams, consonance drills.
These are my nightmares.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.748
But you? You're made for it.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.167
You are.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.673
However, if things do get out of hand,

14:42.756 --> 14:45.676
I will distract Ms. De La Torre
with a flash bomb.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.137
Non-lethal, of course.

14:48.762 --> 14:52.349
And then, we will rappel out
through the ceiling.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.563
All right. Let's do this.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.317
Anything suspicious, and we abort.
Look for my signal.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.363
-Constance?
-Oh, yes. I will not be doing the plan.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.702
What? Constance, wait, wait. You have to.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.163
Constance.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.500
Constance.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.461
OSHIRO: Let's get to it.

15:20.544 --> 15:26.216
Describe how you might fold this structure
12 times, evenly, while blindfolded.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.720
Assume you have been given
no more than 15 seconds to study it

15:29.803 --> 15:33.140
and defend your strategy without referring
back to the drawing afterward.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.224
Begin.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.726
-Trail mix.
-Yup.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.561
Dried pineapple for energy.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.521
Marcona almonds to keep you sated
through the rough stretches.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.522
Thank you.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.777
If you need a little, hmm...

15:45.319 --> 15:46.862
ackee and saltfish.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.073
My roommate at university
was from Jamaica.

15:49.156 --> 15:52.743
Uh, ackee is illegal
in the vast majority of the country.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.036
Why is that?

15:54.119 --> 15:57.790
It contains hypoglycin,
which can kill you in a near-instant.

15:58.374 --> 16:03.003
When properly prepared,
all toxins dissipate. Eh?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.088
Perfectly harmless.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.881
It's just incredible to me

16:05.965 --> 16:08.801
that people would take
an unnecessary chance with their health

16:08.884 --> 16:09.885
and that of others.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.970
Nothing to worry about.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.513
NUMBER TWO:
How did you even get this fruit?

16:12.596 --> 16:15.224
Did you assess individual ripeness
prior to reaching a boiling point?

16:15.808 --> 16:20.688
I didn't need to.
I would never put us at unnecessary risk.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.608
MILLIGAN: Mr. Benedict. Optics prepared?

16:24.692 --> 16:27.486
Yes, yes. Collimated perfectly.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.738
-NUMBER TWO: What are you doing?
-Ooh.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.241
I'm a set of eyes!

16:32.324 --> 16:34.702
Eyes that will recognize
what they're looking for.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.829
You know, the Katsuta Precept.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.789
An observer who knows
the heart of the enemy

16:38.872 --> 16:40.290
is worth a dozen skilled scouts.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.501
I'd say that was as true today
as it was in feudal Japan.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.627
-Wouldn't you say?
-Mm-hmm.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.337
-It's reckless.
-I don't know.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.548
A little recklessness
might do some good, eh?

16:47.631 --> 16:50.175
Thank you for your nonsensical suggestion.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.803
-Who knows where he has people looking?

16:52.886 --> 16:58.851
You will be captured, bound,
then encaged, fed saltines,

16:58.934 --> 17:02.229
if anything,
through a hatch in an iron room.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.148
Through a hatch!

17:04.565 --> 17:07.651
Yes, it is not without risk.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.320
But I'm still going.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.282
Milligan, after you. Cheers.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.950
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.874
Thank you. Thank you.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.252
Now, it is very well.

17:35.679 --> 17:39.892
Before we begin,
thank you for your dedication.

17:39.975 --> 17:46.356
I'm impressed, honored, grateful.
Best of luck.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.417
Begin.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.939
Sticky Washington.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.819
Drop the pencil.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.531
And report
to the waiting room immediately.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.336
I gotta stay hydrated.

19:31.920 --> 19:37.009
I researched the number one cause
of hiking fatalities is dehydration so...

19:37.426 --> 19:39.344
Only two more miles
until we reach the summit.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.554
Hmm.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.431
Two miles. Excellent. Excellent.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.392
I just need to get a look at him

19:45.475 --> 19:48.854
and then I'll see and I'll know,
I'll find a weakness.

19:48.937 --> 19:53.442
I thought that the objective was
to get eyes on the construction project.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.945
Oh, of course.
This mission has many dimensions.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.780
It's a fact-finding mission.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.990
-There's...
-Halt!

20:01.575 --> 20:06.705
That is stinging nettle.
Tiny, needle-like hairs.

20:06.788 --> 20:10.542
Itching welts, redness, rash.
Lasting pain.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.252
Oh, my.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.671
It seems you've been stung before?

20:16.256 --> 20:17.466
I believe I have.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.219
Thank you, Milligan.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.639
You are really made for the outdoors,
aren't you?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.809
I suppose I am.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.399
-Did you say two miles? Ah.
-Two.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.740
-JACKSON: Wait here.
-Um...

20:43.659 --> 20:45.202
What exactly am I waiting for?

22:01.278 --> 22:02.404
I've been thinking.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.950
After our encounter in Stonetown,
I felt the aura here shift.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.368
-The aura?
-The vibe.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.704
RHONDA: The etheric energy.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.875
I won't work somewhere
where the rules are exceedingly rigid,

22:14.958 --> 22:18.337
and the vibe is so professionally humid.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.424
And I won't let someone's
personal business endanger our mission.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.052
I'm not going to stop, Number Two.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.428
Then maybe, you should leave.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.892
I'll finish installing the camouflage,
then I'm gone.

22:33.101 --> 22:37.272
Call them what you will, but to me,
there are no small acts.

22:52.662 --> 22:55.791
So, how'd the you-know-what go?

22:55.874 --> 23:00.337
I aced the feeble test.
Oshiro acknowledged me as his superior.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.507
That look on his face was surprise
since you were failing before.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.300
I decided to try.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.345
Where's Sticky?

23:11.932 --> 23:16.770
Okay. Brutal honesty. It did not go well.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.648
I don't think we need to panic yet,

23:20.148 --> 23:24.069
but Sticky did get caught
and was sent to the Waiting Room.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.278
What?

23:26.696 --> 23:27.781
This is all my fault.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.866
I would argue that it's Kate's fault.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.660
He could be waiting there to be erased.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.621
I anticipated
something like this might happen,

23:34.704 --> 23:37.290
so I went ahead and created
23 rescue scenarios

23:37.374 --> 23:39.376
in case one of you ever got caught.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.378
Sticky only loses an arm in two of them.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.921
But you're the brains,

23:43.004 --> 23:45.006
so I'll let you choose
which one we go with.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.717
Someone loses an arm
in two different scenarios?

23:47.801 --> 23:49.553
Not someone. Sticky.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.596
I appreciate the spirit of that, but...

23:51.680 --> 23:53.682
A couple scenarios need work, I'll admit.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.435
At this point,
should we consider Sticky a casualty?

23:56.518 --> 23:58.895
No! We have to help him.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.649
We need a plan,
one where someone doesn't lose anything.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.235
We should find out what happens
in the Waiting Room,

24:05.318 --> 24:06.653
shake someone down.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.532
Poor Sticky.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.952
He will be crushed under pressure.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.581
You're both thinking it.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.792
-

24:53.116 --> 24:55.160
MAN: I am beyond worry at this point.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.620
We're doing everything that we can.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.330
MAN: The Emergency keeps getting worse.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.415
I hate to cancel our trip
to the salt flats, but...

25:00.499 --> 25:04.127
WOMAN: It's just not safe anywhere now.
There's no one at the wheel.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.559
HOST: She might go by the name Number Two,

25:19.643 --> 25:21.061
but she's been number one

25:21.144 --> 25:24.564
here at the Sheffield's Classic
for two years in a row.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.667
You know that doesn't help.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.461
-Not in the slightest.
-Hmm.

25:47.879 --> 25:52.592
Keeps me sane.
And when I'm sane, I'm unbeatable.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.613
Oh.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.534
Hello there.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.539
Have you been waiting a while?
Please, come in.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.556
Well, come in.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.683
-Have a seat.

26:50.650 --> 26:51.693
Amazing.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.404
-CURTAIN: So...
-I cheated.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.449
I'm sorry. I know it was wrong,
and you probably don't believe me,

26:57.532 --> 26:59.284
but believe me
that I did not want to do it,

26:59.367 --> 27:00.702
and I'll never do it again.

27:03.705 --> 27:07.042
Cheating? Well, that's news to me.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.004
Ms. De La Torre's report
only mentions disruptive fidgeting.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.840
There's already a report?

27:13.923 --> 27:16.593
What disturbs me is that
you'd feel the need to cheat.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.054
Walk me through that.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.722
What?

27:20.805 --> 27:22.724
Would you say there's a flaw
in our curriculum?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.225
Is there something we're not seeing?

27:30.357 --> 27:36.071
Well, perhaps it's all the pressure, sir.

27:36.404 --> 27:40.158
The tests.
It can be a lot to handle for children.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.535
-Oh.
-Mildly terrifying.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.330
I don't think they measure
true intelligence,

27:45.413 --> 27:47.791
or all forms of intelligence.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.085
Wow.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.129
Even now,
looking out for the lesser student.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.341
How altruistic.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.012
You weren't fidgeting.
I know it was Morse code.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.849
CURTAIN: It's clever, Mr. Washington.
But let's be honest.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.310
You weren't exactly using a telegraph,
were you?

28:08.103 --> 28:09.354
The recipient was in the room.

28:10.230 --> 28:13.024
Who were you working with, Sticky?
Was it Polly Mayfire?

28:13.108 --> 28:15.777
She's so vocal about her knowledge
of cryptology.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.531
Too vocal, I think. It was Pyotr Fernsby.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.284
No, he's not brave enough.
It must be somebody.

28:25.120 --> 28:25.954
Who?

28:32.293 --> 28:38.842
Wow. Look at that.
Loyalty under pressure. That's admirable.

28:39.676 --> 28:43.888
But there is the greater good to consider.
Progress cannot be interrupted.

28:44.305 --> 28:49.144
Now, perhaps a bit more waiting then.
You were only in there a short time.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.355
That was a short time?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.525
Oh, yes. No time at all.

29:40.320 --> 29:46.326
BENEDICT: Now, according to the children,
the activity is due east of the inlet.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.327
So, let's see.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.960
Ah...

29:56.044 --> 30:00.298
There it is. Oh, my goodness.
It's a fan blade of some kind.

30:00.882 --> 30:05.178
Massive. Gears, motors,
high-voltage wiring.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.389
Those are hydroelectric turbines.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.934
Why does he need all that power?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.229
That, my friend, is the question.

30:14.312 --> 30:17.690
It's vastly more than what he needs
for subliminal messaging.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.361
Something bigger is coming.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.072
MILLIGAN: We should strategize,
get back to the encampment.

30:24.155 --> 30:28.159
No, no, no. No.
All the more reason to stay. No.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.539
-It's getting late, sir.
-No, no, no.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.041
Our work here
is not yet complete, Milligan.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.426
Please. Just a bit longer.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.179
I know there's more.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.640
I know that he'll...

30:52.684 --> 30:54.060
he'll reveal something.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.070
We'll stay until we spot him, sir.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.909
Thank you, Milligan.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.548
-

31:34.934 --> 31:36.519
NUMBER TWO: Could you give me a hand?

31:42.066 --> 31:43.151
Thank you.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.348
Sticky!

32:16.142 --> 32:17.310
Sticky!

32:20.688 --> 32:22.065
Sticky, what happened?

32:31.199 --> 32:32.283
Sticky?

32:34.410 --> 32:35.453
Sticky?

32:37.205 --> 32:38.331
Your memory.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.792
Oh, no.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.004
Please, you have to remember me. Please!

32:47.757 --> 32:48.841
Reynie...

32:50.051 --> 32:51.344
it was awful.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.639
You remember my name.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.351
So, you weren't brainswept.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.645
Sadly, I remember everything.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.607
I thought anxiety meant stomachaches
and eye twitching.

33:05.900 --> 33:06.985
But the Waiting Room?

33:08.277 --> 33:10.905
It's unbelievable
what it can make you think.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.283
That sounds terrible.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.331
-Wonderful Wetherall and her... Sticky!
-

33:23.710 --> 33:26.295
Oh, man! I'm so glad to see you! I was...

33:26.754 --> 33:27.797
We were worried.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.383
Did Curtain interrogate you
under a bright lamp?

33:30.466 --> 33:32.677
Did you give us up? Did you rat?

33:33.094 --> 33:34.095
No.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.682
I'm sorry
you had to go through that alone.

33:38.224 --> 33:41.185
Actually, I think I might be tough.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.856
At least, when it comes
to protecting something I care about.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.281
Kate, I'm scared to ask.
How did you do on your test?

33:53.364 --> 33:54.741
Total disaster.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.951
We'll have confirmation
when the list goes up tomorrow.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.786
This is starting to feel hopeless.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.122
And dangerous. Don't forget dangerous.

34:01.414 --> 34:05.585
Curtain said I was interrupting progress.
He's getting closer to something.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.965
Actually, I have good news.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.096
"The voice of the prince
from an interior apartment calling out,

34:17.180 --> 34:19.932
'Noble Waldemar Fitzurse!'

34:20.016 --> 34:21.267
And with bonnet doffed,

34:21.350 --> 34:26.022
the future chancellor hastened to receive
the orders of the future sovereign."

34:31.694 --> 34:35.239
Well, it's been a tough day, hasn't it?

34:36.365 --> 34:40.328
Well, we... Important discovery
with the turbines though, I think?

34:42.830 --> 34:48.586
I can't help but feel I'm hunting
something just out of reach.

34:54.258 --> 34:55.843
You know, Milligan, uh...

34:57.845 --> 34:59.931
there might be a way for us to help you.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.600
To recover what is lost.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.978
Or, rather, what has been taken from you.

35:08.731 --> 35:15.321
There's a puzzle inside me, sir,

35:15.738 --> 35:19.992
that wants to be solved, but I...

35:25.581 --> 35:28.793
I can't help feeling I'm missing a piece.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.591
A puzzle missing a piece, that's like...

35:36.801 --> 35:39.679
Oh, I can't think of a simile. Long day.

35:40.346 --> 35:44.142
Just, um, know that I'm here for you.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.186
When and if.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.399
That's very kind of you, sir.

35:55.278 --> 35:59.407
Now, shall we continue? Oh.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.200
NUMBER TWO: You're on page 130.

36:01.284 --> 36:04.495
Ah. Thank you, Number Two. Let's see...

36:05.121 --> 36:07.874
Ta-ta-da, ta-ta-da. Yes!

36:08.583 --> 36:11.377
"On the next morning,
the knight departed early

36:11.460 --> 36:13.254
with the intention
of making a long journey.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.007
The condition of his horse,
which he had carefully spared

36:16.090 --> 36:17.633
during the preceding morning,

36:17.717 --> 36:23.347
being such as enabled him to travel far
without the necessity of much repose."

36:24.515 --> 36:27.101
It took time, but I decoded the journal.

36:27.852 --> 36:31.230
All of your sounds annoy me.
I couldn't concentrate.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.940
-Our sounds?
-Yeah.

36:33.399 --> 36:37.653
Kate's finger tapping,
Sticky's chewing, Reynie's breathing.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.199
-My breathing?
-You breathe like a fat man.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.495
When I finally had silence, I saw it.

36:48.623 --> 36:53.085
-The book is in Caesar code.
-You mean like ROT13?

36:53.169 --> 36:54.670
Standard substitution cipher?

36:54.754 --> 36:58.424
Where the letter written stands
for the letter 13 places away?

36:58.507 --> 37:02.220
Kind of. First word is ROT13,

37:02.303 --> 37:06.432
but the second is ROT14 and so on.

37:07.808 --> 37:08.893
Wow.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.731
A rotating ROT code. "Rote" ROT.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.107
Way to go.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.112
That's amazing, Constance.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.406
Stop your breathing, and I can do more.

37:22.490 --> 37:27.203
Man, this guy is paranoid.
But I'm pretty sure I can read it now.

37:27.828 --> 37:28.829
KATE: Great!

37:31.540 --> 37:34.627
The first page is about
competing headwear options.

37:34.710 --> 37:37.505
"Tuques versus berets." Odd.

37:37.922 --> 37:41.634
And the shoe I was drawing
is supposed to be a diagram of his brain.

37:42.510 --> 37:46.222
-Next.
-He's just talking to himself here.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.517
STICKY: "The endless burden of greatness
is mine to bear."

37:49.850 --> 37:55.106
Then he goes into his diet regimen?
What's "agro-paleo"?

37:55.189 --> 37:57.149
Boring. Anything we can use?

37:57.233 --> 38:02.196
Um... Here. He's outlining something.
A huge plan, imminent changes,

38:02.488 --> 38:05.533
and something called The Improvement.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.369
The Improvement?
There's no way that's good.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.829
What's that part?

38:10.288 --> 38:12.123
It looks like a list of names.

38:12.206 --> 38:15.668
"Francis Lin, Bertrand Kohl,
Hildegard Billingsley."

38:15.751 --> 38:18.004
Her parents must have hated her.

38:19.422 --> 38:21.799
"Arthur Bloom."

38:22.925 --> 38:25.052
REYNIE: The school inspector
whose memory got erased.

38:25.136 --> 38:30.266
It must be some kind of enemies list
for people he wants to brainsweep.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.475
Wait...

38:32.977 --> 38:34.145
there's more.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.148
"Rhonda Kazembe,

38:38.774 --> 38:39.900
Number Two."

38:41.193 --> 38:44.572
"Nicholas Benedict."

38:49.577 --> 38:50.661
BENEDICT: Hmm.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.468
You're up early, sir.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.887
Oh, good morning.

39:08.804 --> 39:12.558
Oh, as a child,
my brother was always an early bird.

39:13.768 --> 39:17.271
He never really noticed that
he also always woke me up in the process.

39:18.898 --> 39:24.195
He was just so sure that if he overslept,
he'd miss some revolutionary discovery.

39:27.656 --> 39:30.326
Here's to hoping
some habits never die. Yes?

39:33.913 --> 39:35.498
BENEDICT: Oh, Milligan. Milligan.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.376
I see him. Oh...

39:38.459 --> 39:39.752
MILLIGAN: What's he doing?

39:39.835 --> 39:44.632
BENEDICT: I'm not sure,
but he has astounding posture.

39:44.715 --> 39:45.800
Posture.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.260
My word, he's so healthy looking.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.345
MILLIGAN: Healthy.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.138
-Fit.
-Well, I mean, you could if you...

39:51.222 --> 39:52.556
Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.620
Yes.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.211
Watch it, scofflaw.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.391
REYNIE: Sticky and I are near the top.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.017
That's good.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.811
Good? That's great.

40:39.311 --> 40:40.980
REYNIE: And Constance is in the green.

40:51.031 --> 40:52.199
Oh, no.

40:58.372 --> 41:02.084
REYNIE: Kate, I don't know what to say.

41:03.043 --> 41:06.297
Don't say anything.
I'm used to moving around freely.

41:07.173 --> 41:10.176
Just bummed
I never got my hands on the Tower.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.931
No use dwelling on failure.
It's like that old saying.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.225
"A good soldier..."

41:21.312 --> 41:24.732
Forgot the rest.
I'll have it by our next mission.

41:25.649 --> 41:26.901
Whenever that is.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.653
You're not scared
about getting brainswept?

41:30.738 --> 41:33.866
Hmm, I hadn't thought about that.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.369
Welp, next time I see you...

41:38.454 --> 41:40.122
if I don't know you...

41:42.374 --> 41:43.375
I knew you.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.785
What do you think you're doing?

42:18.661 --> 42:21.580
-I... I think it's sprained.
-Get up!

42:21.664 --> 42:23.916
Injuries are for the weak.
Show some mettle!

42:24.500 --> 42:27.211
MARTINA: Tetherball is the pride
of this institution.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.588
Get off my court.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.512
STUDENT: Come on. You'll be fine.

42:36.971 --> 42:41.016
Hey, Bucket! You're up.
My forearm slice needs a victim.

42:42.059 --> 42:45.521
-I'm supposed to report to...
-I wasn't asking. Now!

42:46.272 --> 42:48.023
Nothing to lose at this point.

42:48.607 --> 42:49.900
Lose that filthy thing.

42:57.157 --> 43:01.245
Regulation match. None of that urchin game
you picked up in the streets.

43:01.328 --> 43:02.621
Just serve.

43:46.415 --> 43:50.878
Unsophisticated, just like I thought.
But there's potential.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.381
-Becky! Get her sizes.
-What?

43:55.049 --> 43:56.592
You're joining my team.

43:57.259 --> 43:58.636
Obviously.

43:59.053 --> 44:02.973
I'm actually being barged right now.
Couldn't do it if I wanted to.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.613
REYNIE: She didn't even say goodbye.

44:18.405 --> 44:23.410
She was a little rough around the edges,
but I felt like she was our secret weapon.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.538
Sadness inside me.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.750
REYNIE: I don't know
if we can do this without her.

44:31.585 --> 44:34.421
KATE: "A good soldier never looks back."

44:35.464 --> 44:36.423
Remembered it.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.092
-REYNIE: Kate!
-STICKY: Kate!

44:38.676 --> 44:39.593
Kate?

44:41.178 --> 44:43.055
-Sorry.
-It's all good.

44:43.138 --> 44:44.348
How'd you pull it off?

44:44.431 --> 44:47.393
Apparently, Martina wanted me
on her tetherball team so badly,

44:47.476 --> 44:50.062
she went straight to Curtain
who actually listened.

44:50.729 --> 44:52.731
-So, you can stay?
-Yup.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.441
It's like a probationary scholarship.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.486
There was tons of paperwork,
but my record's clean.

44:57.569 --> 45:00.698
And now, I'm tetherball
junior assistant captain.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.575
Which I am sure Martina made up.

45:03.659 --> 45:04.660
What's her title?

45:04.743 --> 45:07.538
Empress Supreme Magistral
of the Flaming Backhand.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.748
WOMAN: ...Sailor. Release him.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.752
Like I said, continue.

45:13.836 --> 45:14.878
Um...

45:15.504 --> 45:19.591
-Constance, are you okay?
-You're telling me none of you hear that?

45:20.175 --> 45:24.346
-Not this again.
-There is a voice in my head.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.391
It comes and goes, but it's not mine.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.602
It's like in another room.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.230
But the door is closed,

45:34.398 --> 45:36.817
so I can't hear it clearly.

45:41.572 --> 45:45.033
We should go. Oshiro's class starts in 15.

45:48.787 --> 45:50.497
I believe you, Constance.

46:00.090 --> 46:03.594
Please connect the nine dots
using four lines,

46:03.677 --> 46:07.347
without the pen leaving the paper
or any dots left over.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.224
Begin.

46:12.519 --> 46:14.897
Hello, my lateral thinkers!

46:14.980 --> 46:18.108
STUDENTS: Good afternoon, Dr. Curtain!

46:18.192 --> 46:20.194
It is, isn't it?

46:20.778 --> 46:24.698
I usually do this more formally,
but it just can't wait.

46:27.326 --> 46:31.079
As you know, we here at the Institute
are called to excellence.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.624
And some of you have answered
that call more quickly

46:33.707 --> 46:36.376
and unconventionally than expected.

46:36.460 --> 46:42.090
So, please join me in celebrating
our newest Messengers.

46:42.966 --> 46:44.426
Reynie Muldoon.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.723
And Sticky Washington.

46:51.850 --> 46:53.352
Thank you, Mr. Oshiro.

46:58.732 --> 46:59.733
STUDENT 1: What?

46:59.817 --> 47:02.152
-STUDENT 2: There's no way.
-STUDENT 3: Seriously?

47:02.236 --> 47:03.320
That's enough.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.948
-STUDENT 4: How did they get it?
-Congratulations, students.

47:09.284 --> 47:11.286
-NUMBER TWO: A hidden entrance.
-BENEDICT: Yeah.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.038
It's subterranean, it appears.

47:13.121 --> 47:16.667
Underwater machinery pumping out
massive, near-endless amounts of energy.

47:16.750 --> 47:20.462
Yes, yes. That, of course.
But this passageway I've discovered...

47:20.546 --> 47:22.214
Against all odds,
despite your resistance...

47:22.297 --> 47:23.882
He'll never let you live this down.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.218
...is precisely the lead we've hoped for.

47:26.301 --> 47:28.804
Well, it's certainly an unexpected find.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.973
-What should we do?
-

47:31.056 --> 47:35.435
Direct infiltration is too risky.
At far too sensitive a moment.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.814
-But the children could do it.
-

47:38.897 --> 47:41.608
I know. But it's so dangerous.

47:42.109 --> 47:44.653
I'd never forgive myself
if something happened.

47:44.945 --> 47:48.907
As you say, sometimes it's more dangerous
to do nothing.

47:55.163 --> 47:58.166
And I do know exactly
how they can get into that underground.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.136
I have faith in them.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.514
We must send them in.
