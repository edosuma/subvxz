00:56.712 --> 00:59.214
- Oh.
- Hey!

01:05.054 --> 01:07.655
What? I think she... got my wallet.

01:07.690 --> 01:08.790
Yeah. Hey!

01:08.824 --> 01:11.059
Hey, stop!

01:11.093 --> 01:12.227
Stop her!

01:19.568 --> 01:21.803
(sirens wailing distantly)

01:25.741 --> 01:28.443
(indistinct chatter)

01:36.585 --> 01:38.586
- (meowing)
- Psst, psst.

01:43.292 --> 01:45.093
(laughter)

01:45.127 --> 01:46.728
(gasps)

01:46.762 --> 01:48.596
Oh, come on, Tom.

01:48.631 --> 01:49.798
It wasn't that bad. Oh, no?

01:49.832 --> 01:51.599
Childish drivel.

01:51.634 --> 01:52.801
(laughter continues)

01:52.835 --> 01:54.736
The acting was fine; the music was lovely.

01:54.770 --> 01:56.838
What about you, Bruce?

01:56.872 --> 01:59.974
Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.

02:00.009 --> 02:02.243
- It was kinda lame.
- "Kinda lame"?

02:02.278 --> 02:05.180
There's no such word as
"kinda." It was totally lame.

02:05.214 --> 02:06.915
You two, so judgment...

02:06.949 --> 02:08.015
What's up, folks?

02:08.050 --> 02:09.616
(gasps) Stay calm, Bruce.

02:09.651 --> 02:10.818
Give me your money!

02:13.055 --> 02:14.356
No problem.

02:16.892 --> 02:19.027
We're cooperating.

02:20.296 --> 02:21.296
The necklace.

02:23.366 --> 02:24.999
(whispering): It's okay.

02:29.071 --> 02:30.505
Easy.

02:30.539 --> 02:32.107
(gunshot)

02:34.143 --> 02:36.411
- (gasps)
- (gun clicks)

02:36.445 --> 02:38.780
- (gunshot)
- (grunts)

02:47.456 --> 02:49.324
(gasping)

02:56.699 --> 02:58.700
(gasping continues)

03:02.071 --> 03:03.905
Mom! Mom?

03:03.939 --> 03:05.840
Dad?

03:05.875 --> 03:06.975
Dad!

03:08.010 --> 03:10.545
(groaning softly)

03:10.579 --> 03:12.447
Dad!

03:19.689 --> 03:21.690
(crying)

03:25.428 --> 03:29.164
(screaming)

03:29.198 --> 03:31.266
OFFICER: Sit down!

03:31.300 --> 03:33.568
Don't move! Yeah, don't touch my face!

03:33.602 --> 03:34.936
(indistinct shouting)

03:34.970 --> 03:36.705
Shut up!

03:36.739 --> 03:38.473
I need my pills.

03:38.507 --> 03:40.141
I need my pills.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.110
(indistinct radio transmission) You wish.

03:42.144 --> 03:44.379
Come on! Where are my pills? Back, back.

03:44.413 --> 03:46.381
- Come on. Give them to me.
- Back. Come on.

03:47.416 --> 03:49.351
Where are my pills?!

03:49.385 --> 03:50.485
(gunshots)

03:50.519 --> 03:53.021
(indistinct shouting)

03:56.525 --> 03:57.759
I said give me my pills, bitch.

03:57.793 --> 03:59.361
Hold your fire!

04:00.529 --> 04:03.231
Hold your fire. I got this.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.434
Hold your fire.

04:06.469 --> 04:07.569
Hold...

04:07.603 --> 04:09.571
Easy, easy.

04:09.605 --> 04:11.406
Sir,

04:11.440 --> 04:12.574
look at me.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.042
Not at them, look at me.

04:14.076 --> 04:16.778
My name's Jim. Jim Gordon. What's yours?

04:16.812 --> 04:18.512
(grunts)

04:18.547 --> 04:21.048
I need my pills.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.784
Okay, well, everything's
gonna be all right.

04:22.818 --> 04:24.486
Look at me, huh?

04:25.554 --> 04:26.988
Got your pills right here.

04:27.023 --> 04:28.590
Huh?

04:28.624 --> 04:29.891
Want some pills?

04:29.925 --> 04:33.628
Here you go, here you go, here's
some pills for you, all right?

04:33.663 --> 04:35.797
(groans)

04:36.666 --> 04:38.767
These aren't my pills.

04:41.370 --> 04:42.804
(groaning)

04:44.173 --> 04:45.974
(sighs)

04:46.008 --> 04:47.075
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:47.109 --> 04:50.345
Sorry, guys. Didn't mean to
bark at you all like that.

04:50.379 --> 04:53.415
- Got a little bit carried away.
- Get up! Hey!

04:53.449 --> 04:54.916
Hey, hey, come on, man, take it easy!

04:54.950 --> 04:56.985
Come on, guys! Hey, hey!

04:57.019 --> 04:58.953
What the hell are you doing?

04:58.988 --> 05:00.655
We had the drop on him.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.257
Yeah, well, he's dropped, isn't he?

05:02.291 --> 05:04.292
You could've gotten hurt. Rookie mistake.

05:04.327 --> 05:06.094
Next time, shoot the son of a bitch.

05:06.128 --> 05:08.163
If I shoot, that sets everybody off.

05:08.197 --> 05:09.764
Gunfire every which way.

05:09.799 --> 05:12.300
Somebody takes a cop's gun, you shoot him.

05:12.335 --> 05:13.435
That's basic.

05:13.469 --> 05:15.837
SERGEANT: Yo, Bullock, Gordon, you're up!

05:15.871 --> 05:17.172
Double homicide, Theater District.

05:17.206 --> 05:19.474
Give me a break; shift's nearly over.

05:19.508 --> 05:21.109
Yeah, nearly.

05:25.114 --> 05:27.949
(distant siren wailing)

05:27.984 --> 05:29.985
(indistinct radio transmissions)

05:31.520 --> 05:33.655
Oh, the legendary Harvey Bullock.

05:33.689 --> 05:36.825
- No rest for the wicked, eh?
- Tannenbaum, looking crisp.

05:36.859 --> 05:38.026
This is my new partner, James Gordon.

05:38.060 --> 05:40.395
- What do we got?
- Just got here myself.

05:40.429 --> 05:42.864
Male, female, gunshot.

05:42.898 --> 05:44.599
Their kid saw the whole thing.

05:44.634 --> 05:46.301
Poor bastard hasn't spoke a word yet.

05:46.335 --> 05:48.470
(crying)

05:59.348 --> 06:01.316
My name's James Gordon.

06:01.350 --> 06:02.817
I'm a detective.

06:02.852 --> 06:04.719
What's your name?

06:04.754 --> 06:07.722
(sniffles)

06:07.757 --> 06:10.792
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

06:10.826 --> 06:13.361
Listen, T., do me a favor.

06:13.396 --> 06:14.562
You didn't see me, okay?

06:14.597 --> 06:16.631
I see you right in front of me.

06:16.666 --> 06:20.335
- What's your problem?
- That's Thomas and Martha Wayne.

06:21.404 --> 06:23.104
I don't need that kind of hassle.

06:23.139 --> 06:25.006
Call Major Crimes;
they'd love to have this.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.908
Yeah, but they're not here.

06:26.942 --> 06:29.177
And your partner is talking to the witness.

06:29.211 --> 06:33.114
So... that makes it your case.

06:34.483 --> 06:36.484
(softly): Bruce.

06:37.553 --> 06:40.355
My-my name is Bruce Wayne.

06:43.059 --> 06:44.893
Can you tell me what happened, Bruce?

06:44.927 --> 06:46.394
(camera shutters clicking)

06:46.429 --> 06:47.729
(crying)

06:47.763 --> 06:50.465
(sobbing)

06:59.875 --> 07:01.610
When I was about your age,

07:01.644 --> 07:03.945
a drunk driver hit our car.

07:05.414 --> 07:07.215
Killed my dad.

07:07.249 --> 07:09.250
I was right next to him.

07:13.155 --> 07:15.924
I know how you feel right now.

07:15.958 --> 07:17.892
(sniffles)

07:17.927 --> 07:20.395
And I promise you,

07:20.429 --> 07:24.366
however dark and scary the
world might be right now,

07:24.400 --> 07:27.135
there will be light.

07:29.639 --> 07:31.873
There will be light, Bruce.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.044
We just got out of the movies.

07:36.078 --> 07:37.979
(sniffles)

07:38.014 --> 07:41.616
We were walking through the alley
to catch an uptown cab, and...

07:43.452 --> 07:45.620
a man came out of the shadows.

07:45.655 --> 07:47.522
He-he was tall

07:47.556 --> 07:50.625
(sniffles) with a black mask and...

07:50.660 --> 07:54.062
he had a hat and gloves...

07:54.096 --> 07:55.997
and shiny shoes.

07:56.032 --> 08:00.335
He took my dad's wallet
and my mom's necklace.

08:02.104 --> 08:04.172
And then he shot them

08:04.206 --> 08:05.473
for no reason.

08:07.143 --> 08:08.944
I should've done something!

08:08.978 --> 08:10.979
But I was too scared.

08:11.013 --> 08:14.816
There was nothing you could've
done to stop what happened.

08:14.850 --> 08:16.851
But there is something you can do now.

08:19.021 --> 08:21.923
You can be strong.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.926
Be strong.

08:24.961 --> 08:27.429
I promise you,

08:27.463 --> 08:29.197
I will find the man who did this.

08:32.134 --> 08:34.302
TANNENBAUM: Hey.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.104
Who the hell is that?

08:46.549 --> 08:50.318
(crying)

08:50.353 --> 08:52.320
James Gordon.

08:52.355 --> 08:54.389
Alfred Pennyworth.

08:54.423 --> 08:56.858
We're gonna get the guy that did this, sir.

08:56.893 --> 08:59.160
New boy, are you?

08:59.195 --> 09:01.162
You could say.

09:01.197 --> 09:03.698
Good luck, mate.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.234
Come on.

09:06.269 --> 09:07.502
(Bruce sniffles)

09:07.536 --> 09:11.606
Don't look. Head up, eyes front.

09:11.641 --> 09:13.541
Don't let them see you crying.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.268
Shouldn't we be there
when they move the victims?

09:30.302 --> 09:31.736
Why?

09:31.770 --> 09:35.306
Listen, hot shot, do me a favor.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.709
Don't start talking to
witnesses until I say so.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.511
- What's your problem?
- My problem, soldier boy,

09:40.546 --> 09:44.515
you just caught us a
gigantic, flaming ball of crap.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.717
Oh, yeah, how's that?

09:45.751 --> 09:48.186
You never heard of Thomas and Martha Wayne?

09:48.220 --> 09:50.588
Yeah, sure, the Wayne Foundation.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.956
Yeah.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.325
Two of the richest and most
powerful people in Gotham.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.996
You can't begin to imagine the pressure,
we don't close this thing quick.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.365
- So let's close it quick.
- Yeah, right.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.367
This is random street robbery, Holmes.

10:02.401 --> 10:06.004
Perp could be any one of
10,000 mopes out there.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.240
(bell dings) Oh, crap.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.875
COOK: Order up!

10:10.910 --> 10:13.178
Well, well, well, if it
isn't Montoya and Allen.

10:13.212 --> 10:14.846
Major Crimes Unit.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.915
This is my new partner, Jim Gordon.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.249
Nice to meet you.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.584
Hi, Harvey.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.620
You're on the Waynes, huh? Terrible thing.

10:22.655 --> 10:23.755
Yeah.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.856
Any leads?

10:24.890 --> 10:27.592
- Just getting started.
- I'll be straight.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.494
You want us to take it off your hands?

10:31.397 --> 10:33.231
No, no, no, no, no, this
is our... Hold on, rook. Ah.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.767
Why you want it?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.101
You got a lead?

10:37.136 --> 10:40.004
Nah. Just need the press action.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.340
I don't know.

10:42.374 --> 10:45.009
Come on, Bullock, you know
you're scared of this case.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.378
- You're damn right I'm scared.
- So then do the right thing for once.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.380
"For once"?

10:49.415 --> 10:51.583
Where the hell you get the
nerve to say that to me?

10:51.617 --> 10:53.017
You can kiss my ass.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.586
Okay, you be that way, brother.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.387
Just trying to be collegial here.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.525
You know, I almost gave it to you,

11:00.559 --> 11:02.827
but you couldn't help yourself, could you?

11:02.861 --> 11:04.963
You had to go and be disrespectful.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.564
Okay, Harvey.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.066
Stay frosty.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.068
Good luck.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.539
Self-righteous do-gooding skell huggers.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.975
Always bad-mouthing us

11:17.009 --> 11:18.977
like they're such freaking angels. Please.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.246
<i>MAN: As mayor of this great city,</i>

11:21.280 --> 11:23.248
I swear to you, the perpetrators
of this heinous crime

11:23.282 --> 11:24.415
will be captured

11:24.450 --> 11:27.252
and will be punished to the fullest extent.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.287
I swear that to you.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.789
Poor bastard. First a
crime wave and now this.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.324
You take all the people
and resources you need.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.693
You just close this case.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.295
Yes, Captain.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.797
Jim, will you give us a minute?

11:41.767 --> 11:44.102
Captain.

11:45.771 --> 11:47.939
(door opens, closes)

11:47.973 --> 11:49.173
The answer's no.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.209
(indistinct shouting)

11:53.546 --> 11:56.180
Yes! What do I have to
do, change his diapers?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.916
You got to be kidding!

11:57.950 --> 12:00.618
(speaks indistinctly) I don't care!

12:00.653 --> 12:02.654
(continues indistinctly)

12:10.863 --> 12:12.597
She said you had to keep me, huh?

12:12.631 --> 12:13.965
Yeah, she did.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.900
She said you were a war hero

12:15.935 --> 12:19.938
and your daddy was a big shot
D.A. back in the olden days,

12:19.972 --> 12:22.473
so I have to keep my trap
shut and do as I'm told.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.942
Ouch.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.344
Listen, kid, you got juice; do me a favor.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.146
Ask for a transfer.

12:28.180 --> 12:31.482
Sorry, this is where the action
is. You'll get used to me.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.485
Jim, you seem like a nice guy,

12:34.520 --> 12:37.455
but this is not a city
or a job for nice guys.

12:37.489 --> 12:38.590
You understand?

12:38.624 --> 12:40.525
No.

12:40.559 --> 12:41.993
And that's your problem.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.229
You're a cynic.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.699
A slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.868
(chuckles)

12:49.902 --> 12:52.170
You're probably right.

12:52.204 --> 12:55.874
Okay, soldier boy,

12:55.908 --> 12:57.909
let's go roust some muggers.

13:00.079 --> 13:02.046
"Lackadaisical"? Hmm.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.318
(woman screams)

13:07.353 --> 13:09.354
(panting)

13:11.557 --> 13:12.657
Hey.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.161
How you doing?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.248
- Guess what this is?
- Just tell me, Ed.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.217
I want riddles, I'll read the funny pages.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.856
It's a .45 caliber 300-grain
cupronickel wadcutter.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.724
Came out of Thomas Wayne's chest.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.960
- That's a six-dollar bullet.
- Uh-huh.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.228
What kind of gun...

13:50.262 --> 13:52.430
Ah-ah-ah, don't ask, just tell.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.033
It's from a pistol not
known by our database.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.568
And no print, either.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.136
What else you got?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.805
What's nowhere but everywhere,
except where something is?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.073
Nothing.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.577
You need professional
help, Nygma, seriously.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.011
Let's go.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.448
GORDON: So I'm thinking,
our man wears shiny shoes,

14:10.482 --> 14:14.385
uses high-end ammo, and nobody
on the street knows who he is?

14:14.420 --> 14:16.154
Maybe he's not from the street.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.656
Like a debonair playboy
robber, does it for kicks?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.992
Who would pretend to
be a street robber, huh?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.627
A professional contract killer

14:22.661 --> 14:24.929
or somebody with a personal
grudge against the Waynes.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.932
How did this professional know the
Waynes would be coming down that alley?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.167
That's a good question.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.202
Essen said we don't catch
a break in the first 48,

14:31.237 --> 14:32.804
it's time to go see Fish Mooney.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.806
Fish Mooney? That works
for Carmine Falcone?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.608
Her. Theater District's her turf.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.910
Anything happens down
there, she hears about it.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.945
(thunder rumbling)

14:49.989 --> 14:52.190
(door closes)

14:52.224 --> 14:54.092
Tell Fish I'm here.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.694
(muffled screaming)

14:56.729 --> 14:57.962
(grunts)

14:57.997 --> 14:58.863
(groans)

14:58.898 --> 15:02.033
I still care for you,
deeply, but I don't believe

15:02.067 --> 15:03.501
that you still care for me anymore.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.702
(stammering)

15:04.737 --> 15:07.438
I c-c-care for you!

15:07.473 --> 15:10.308
Then where's my money?

15:10.342 --> 15:12.343
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.478
(groans)

15:15.481 --> 15:17.282
Boy!

15:17.316 --> 15:19.651
Sorry.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.287
If you let this hair
go frizzy, you will be.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.855
(sniffing)

15:23.889 --> 15:26.658
WAITER: Ma'am, Detective Bullock is here.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.930
- Keep him warm.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.167
Hey, Oswald?

15:36.202 --> 15:38.303
You want a turn? May I?

15:38.337 --> 15:39.437
Knock yourself out, kid.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.905
(groaning)

15:40.940 --> 15:42.540
Thank you, Mr. Gilzean.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.843
(stammering)

15:44.877 --> 15:46.211
(groans)

15:46.245 --> 15:48.046
(laughing, thunder rumbling)

15:50.049 --> 15:51.649
(groans)

15:51.684 --> 15:53.218
(laughing)

15:54.253 --> 15:57.188
- Harvey. (chuckles)
- Fish.

15:57.223 --> 16:00.925
Where have you been?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.527
Where haven't I been?

16:02.561 --> 16:04.195
(chuckles)

16:05.364 --> 16:08.900
- Who's the friend?
- Detective James Gordon, ma'am.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.068
(grunts)

16:10.102 --> 16:12.837
Well, aren't you a cool glass of milk?

16:12.872 --> 16:16.841
Ma'am, was that screaming
we heard back there?

16:16.876 --> 16:19.210
Yes, my boys are watching a scary movie.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.945
Really? No.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.382
Actually, one of my staff has
been stealing money from me,

16:24.416 --> 16:27.552
so we're beating his punk ass.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.954
BULLOCK: Relax, junior.
Fish gets some leeway.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.224
Her staff are rough
characters, need firm handling.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.161
So, this isn't a social visit then?

16:36.195 --> 16:37.762
Unfortunately not.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.931
Brass sent me by to talk to
you about the Wayne murders.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.266
Terrible thing.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.201
(muffled screaming)

16:43.235 --> 16:45.069
Listen, junior, if you're worried,

16:45.104 --> 16:48.306
why don't you go back there and see
if anyone wants to press charges?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.141
If that's okay with you, Fish.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.077
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

16:56.816 --> 16:59.417
(blows landing, muffled screaming)

17:00.219 --> 17:01.753
(metallic banging)

17:01.787 --> 17:03.154
(groaning)

17:08.027 --> 17:10.762
- Oswald, whoa.
- Yeah, take it easy, penguin.

17:10.796 --> 17:13.064
You know I don't like to be called that.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.732
Ooh, scary.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.501
How's everybody doing?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.435
Who are you?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.472
James Gordon, GCPD.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.673
Oh.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.906
You came with Harvey, huh?

17:22.942 --> 17:25.276
Glad to know you, James. I'm Butch Gilzean.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.179
Drop the bat.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.815
Ah, come on now.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.851
Oswald and Raoul here

17:32.885 --> 17:34.419
were just having a little
fun, weren't you, boys?

17:34.453 --> 17:36.121
All in fun.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.455
RAOUL: No problem.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.690
Fun.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.457
(laughs)

17:39.492 --> 17:41.526
You a new guy, huh?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.696
How do you like Gotham so far?

17:44.730 --> 17:46.731
Well enough.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.602
See you around.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.340
(groans)

17:55.374 --> 17:56.875
(Fish and Bullock laughing)

17:58.644 --> 18:00.712
Oh, hey.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.447
Everything all right back there?

18:02.481 --> 18:06.217
It's always good to see you, Harvey.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.216
Wow.

18:36.251 --> 18:38.285
And look at you in your excellent suit.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.721
You know, I'm so happy

18:40.755 --> 18:43.724
you don't have to wear
that silly uniform anymore.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.225
You told me it looked good.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.695
(whispering): I lied.

18:47.729 --> 18:49.196
(chuckles)

18:49.230 --> 18:50.698
You ready to rock and roll?

18:50.732 --> 18:54.501
Uh... Barbara, I'm beat.

18:54.536 --> 18:56.370
Do we really have to go to this thing?

18:56.404 --> 18:58.672
No.

18:58.707 --> 18:59.974
Of course not.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.009
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

19:03.111 --> 19:05.079
(sighs)

19:05.113 --> 19:07.715
So...

19:07.749 --> 19:09.283
talk to me.

19:09.317 --> 19:11.752
We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.789
I made a promise to Bruce
Wayne and I can't deliver.

19:15.824 --> 19:17.891
But you will.

19:17.926 --> 19:20.494
I don't know.

19:20.528 --> 19:22.096
Maybe I'm out of my depth.

19:22.505 --> 19:24.139
Hey.

19:24.173 --> 19:27.209
I very much doubt you're out of your depth,

19:27.243 --> 19:29.311
but even if you are,

19:29.345 --> 19:31.713
you know how to swim, don't you?

19:31.748 --> 19:34.383
Yes, I do.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.318
So swim.

19:36.352 --> 19:38.086
(sighs)

19:38.121 --> 19:39.554
I'll swim, you're right.

19:39.589 --> 19:41.323
You hungry?

19:41.357 --> 19:42.991
I'm all right.

19:43.026 --> 19:44.626
Had a few dogs.

19:44.660 --> 19:47.195
When I am Mrs. Gordon, and you
are living here all the time,

19:47.230 --> 19:50.032
I am gonna put you on
a proper, healthy diet.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.068
Mm-hmm.

20:02.979 --> 20:04.980
(phone buzzing)

20:09.752 --> 20:11.386
BULLOCK: I got a lead.

20:11.421 --> 20:14.089
Meet me at Fourth and Grundy in an hour.

20:14.123 --> 20:15.724
On my way.

20:18.027 --> 20:20.028
(rock music playing over speakers)

20:33.876 --> 20:35.243
Hey.

20:35.278 --> 20:36.244
Whoa.

20:36.279 --> 20:38.046
You all right?

20:38.081 --> 20:41.216
- Couple drinks, I'll be fine.
- Bullock...

20:41.250 --> 20:43.619
Fish Mooney heard from one of her fences,

20:43.653 --> 20:47.356
guy tried to sell him an antique
four-strand pearl necklace

20:47.390 --> 20:50.492
with gold settings, one strand broken.

20:50.526 --> 20:52.461
Like Martha Wayne was wearing.

20:52.495 --> 20:54.496
Guy's name is Mario Pepper.

20:56.499 --> 20:58.266
<i>Career street thug.</i>

20:58.301 --> 21:02.604
Long sheet: robbery, assault,
rape, extortion, drug dealing.

21:02.639 --> 21:04.640
Nice guy.

21:11.347 --> 21:13.115
Hi.

21:13.149 --> 21:15.784
What's your name? Ivy.

21:15.818 --> 21:17.986
Ivy. Is Daddy home?

21:18.021 --> 21:19.755
You don't want to talk to Daddy.

21:19.789 --> 21:21.089
Why's that, Ivy?

21:23.459 --> 21:25.127
(whispers): He's mean.

21:25.161 --> 21:27.129
PEPPER: Hey, who is it?!

21:30.300 --> 21:32.634
Mario Pepper, we need to talk.

21:32.669 --> 21:35.103
I've done nothing.

21:35.138 --> 21:38.840
So it'll be a pleasant talk.

21:40.343 --> 21:42.477
Where were you last
Saturday night around 9:30?

21:42.512 --> 21:45.814
I was here at home with my family.

21:45.848 --> 21:47.616
That's right. He was here.

21:47.650 --> 21:49.818
Pearl necklace sound familiar?

21:49.852 --> 21:52.287
No.

21:52.322 --> 21:55.991
Then I guess you don't mind we,
uh, take a look around the place.

21:57.026 --> 21:58.493
You need a warrant.

21:58.528 --> 22:00.395
You're a felon on parole.

22:00.430 --> 22:02.130
All we need is reasonable cause.

22:08.838 --> 22:10.606
(grunts)

22:19.148 --> 22:20.949
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

22:26.422 --> 22:27.856
(gun clicks empty)

22:39.535 --> 22:42.271
(machines rattling)

22:42.305 --> 22:43.805
(woman shrieks)

22:53.516 --> 22:55.817
(men shouting)

23:01.124 --> 23:02.491
Out of the way!

23:16.205 --> 23:17.940
(metal clangs in distance)

23:17.974 --> 23:19.274
(yelling)

23:41.397 --> 23:42.898
(gunshot)

23:47.170 --> 23:48.971
Thanks.

24:05.672 --> 24:07.306
Probably? I had to.

24:22.288 --> 24:23.822
We got him!

24:25.125 --> 24:27.660
We got him.

24:27.694 --> 24:29.328
(chuckles)

24:29.362 --> 24:30.963
Huh?

24:30.997 --> 24:32.031
Hmm?

24:34.701 --> 24:36.335
(cheering)

24:44.811 --> 24:46.812
(siren whoops)

25:03.697 --> 25:06.365
Mario Pepper was framed by
Fish Mooney and the cops.

25:08.535 --> 25:10.736
I saw Ms. Mooney with
Martha Wayne's necklace.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.839
She was discussing how to
get it into Pepper's home

25:13.873 --> 25:15.841
inside a bag of drugs.

25:15.875 --> 25:17.509
This was shortly after she met with

25:17.544 --> 25:19.578
Detectives Bullock and Gordon
from the homicide squad.

25:19.612 --> 25:23.215
Mooney works with Carmine Falcone's mob.

25:23.249 --> 25:25.317
You saying Falcone had the Waynes killed?

25:25.352 --> 25:27.252
I'm just telling you what I saw.

25:27.287 --> 25:29.388
Why? Why snitch on your own boss?

25:29.422 --> 25:31.490
I confess, that...

25:31.524 --> 25:33.726
that poor orphan boy pricked my conscience.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.327
Nah.

25:35.362 --> 25:37.596
You want to push Fish out, huh?

25:40.300 --> 25:42.201
That's beside the point.

25:43.103 --> 25:44.336
I've done my civic duty.

25:44.371 --> 25:46.605
Good day to you both.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.208
(car door opens, closes)

26:33.920 --> 26:37.623
You kept your promise.

26:37.657 --> 26:38.824
Thank you.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.727
I'm sorry you didn't see a trial.

26:41.761 --> 26:43.963
That's okay.

27:01.381 --> 27:03.015
Renee.

27:03.049 --> 27:04.483
Long time.

27:04.517 --> 27:06.619
Yeah.

27:09.055 --> 27:11.023
(sighs)

27:11.057 --> 27:13.926
Sorry to drop by unexpected like this.

27:15.996 --> 27:17.763
How have you been?

27:17.797 --> 27:20.332
I'm good.

27:20.367 --> 27:23.402
- You?
- All good.

27:23.436 --> 27:25.604
You're running an art gallery now, right?

27:25.639 --> 27:29.241
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

27:29.276 --> 27:30.676
And I'm engaged.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.311
That's why I'm here.

27:32.345 --> 27:33.879
Oh?

27:33.914 --> 27:36.882
The GCPD framed Mario Pepper
for the murder of the Waynes.

27:36.917 --> 27:39.285
What?

27:39.319 --> 27:42.054
They framed and killed an innocent man.

27:42.088 --> 27:44.223
And you're here to tell me
that James was in on this?

27:44.257 --> 27:46.458
- Yes.
- And what's your proof?

27:46.493 --> 27:48.560
I can't tell you, but it's the truth.

27:48.595 --> 27:51.397
James Gordon is not a good guy.

27:51.431 --> 27:52.731
You deserve better.

27:52.766 --> 27:56.702
James Gordon is the most
honest man I've ever met.

27:56.736 --> 27:58.704
He's not capable of doing that.

27:58.738 --> 28:00.573
You sure you know what he's capable of?

28:00.607 --> 28:01.974
Yes, thank you. I know him.

28:02.008 --> 28:03.475
Does he know you?

28:03.510 --> 28:05.144
Don't.

28:05.178 --> 28:08.380
Like I know you?

28:10.216 --> 28:13.185
(siren wailing in distance)

28:15.956 --> 28:17.957
Here you are.

28:20.927 --> 28:22.628
Barbara?

28:22.662 --> 28:25.464
What's wrong?

28:25.498 --> 28:27.333
Did you frame Mario Pepper?

28:30.870 --> 28:33.405
- No.
- I knew it.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.874
Who told you that Pepper was framed?

28:34.908 --> 28:36.508
It doesn't matter, as
long as it's not true.

28:36.543 --> 28:38.043
It's not. Who told you it was?

28:38.078 --> 28:39.879
Nobody.

28:39.913 --> 28:42.681
Bee, I know when you're lying.

28:44.751 --> 28:46.685
GORDON: Montoya!

28:50.924 --> 28:52.591
What's your evidence
that Pepper was framed?

28:52.626 --> 28:54.593
I was wrong to reveal that
information to Barbara.

28:54.628 --> 28:57.463
- We're old friends.
- I asked what evidence you have.

28:57.497 --> 29:00.366
You'll see the evidence when we get you

29:00.400 --> 29:02.735
and your crooked friends into a courtroom.

29:02.769 --> 29:04.236
We're working on it.

29:05.505 --> 29:06.972
Save your energy.

29:07.007 --> 29:09.542
If Pepper was framed, I'll find out.

29:09.576 --> 29:12.278
Hey. We got a problem here, Gordon?

29:12.312 --> 29:16.615
And then you and you just
need to stay out of my way.

29:19.819 --> 29:22.154
- GORDON: Mrs. Pepper...
- Go away.

29:22.189 --> 29:26.125
Ma'am... if your husband was
innocent, you need to talk to me.

29:32.799 --> 29:35.634
If your husband didn't kill the
Waynes, how did he come to have

29:35.669 --> 29:36.635
Martha Wayne's necklace?

29:36.670 --> 29:39.138
You bastards planted it on him.

29:39.172 --> 29:40.506
IVY: Bastards.

29:41.808 --> 29:44.743
Alice, how would the
police have the necklace?

29:44.778 --> 29:47.246
- We didn't kill the Waynes.
- So you say.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.215
God knows my husband had his demons,

29:49.249 --> 29:50.950
but he never killed nobody.

29:50.984 --> 29:54.153
Can I see his shoes?

29:54.187 --> 29:56.422
Shoes?

30:03.063 --> 30:04.864
This is all of them?

30:04.898 --> 30:08.100
Uh-huh.

30:08.134 --> 30:09.268
(whispers): Damn.

30:09.302 --> 30:10.436
<i>BULLOCK: Framed?</i>

30:10.470 --> 30:12.104
How you figure?

30:12.138 --> 30:14.540
You were there. We framed him?

30:14.574 --> 30:15.941
Somebody could've planted
the necklace on Pepper

30:15.976 --> 30:17.142
for us to find.

30:17.177 --> 30:18.677
Fish Mooney could've
set the whole thing up.

30:18.712 --> 30:19.812
Why?

30:19.846 --> 30:22.548
To cover up for the real killer.

30:22.582 --> 30:24.149
Mooney works for Falcone.

30:24.184 --> 30:27.019
Maybe Falcone wanted the Waynes killed.

30:27.053 --> 30:29.154
Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait, wait.

30:29.189 --> 30:31.991
Why would such a nutty
idea even enter your head?

30:32.025 --> 30:34.293
Montoya from MCU.

30:34.327 --> 30:38.063
That pill-head loony
bird? What's her proof?

30:38.098 --> 30:39.732
Wouldn't tell me. Didn't trust me.

30:39.766 --> 30:41.534
She doesn't have any.

30:41.568 --> 30:43.335
If they did, they would've used it.

30:43.370 --> 30:46.839
Pepper didn't wear shiny shoes.

30:46.873 --> 30:48.674
He didn't own any shiny shoes.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.876
Shiny shoes! Mother of God.

30:50.911 --> 30:51.877
Shiny shoes.

30:51.912 --> 30:53.846
Just suppose for a moment, just suppose

30:53.880 --> 30:55.481
Pepper was innocent.

30:55.515 --> 30:57.016
I killed him.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.884
<i>We killed him.</i>

30:58.919 --> 30:59.919
We killed him.

31:00.954 --> 31:03.756
We'd lose our jobs at the very least.

31:03.790 --> 31:06.759
The case is closed. Forget about it.

31:09.196 --> 31:11.497
Even if the real killers
are still out there?

31:11.531 --> 31:12.665
Yes.

31:14.134 --> 31:16.435
This is very perilous
stuff you're messing with.

31:16.469 --> 31:19.305
Listen to me, for once, Jim.

31:19.339 --> 31:20.773
Forget about it.

31:27.948 --> 31:29.949
(door opens)

31:31.284 --> 31:32.918
Detective Gordon.

31:32.953 --> 31:34.453
Tell Mooney I'm here.

31:34.487 --> 31:36.856
- May I ask why?
- No.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.791
No. Yes. (chuckles)

31:39.826 --> 31:41.927
James Gordon.

31:41.962 --> 31:44.063
How nice.

31:44.097 --> 31:47.066
Day I met you, when I was
out back with your boys,

31:47.100 --> 31:48.734
what did you and Harvey talk about?

31:49.769 --> 31:52.438
Should you ask Harvey?

31:52.472 --> 31:54.206
He's your partner.

31:54.241 --> 31:55.641
I'm afraid he might lie.

31:55.675 --> 31:56.642
Hmm.

31:56.676 --> 31:58.711
He might.

31:58.745 --> 32:00.112
And you think I'll tell you the truth?

32:03.450 --> 32:05.084
You just did.

32:07.521 --> 32:08.988
James, wait.

32:15.428 --> 32:17.663
You have a little danger in your eye.

32:19.132 --> 32:22.067
I wonder what you plan to do with that.

32:22.102 --> 32:23.936
You'll have to wait and see.

32:25.438 --> 32:27.173
I hate surprises.

32:35.982 --> 32:37.850
(panting)

32:41.154 --> 32:43.088
BARBARA: Detective Bullock?

32:45.358 --> 32:46.792
Miss Kean.

32:46.826 --> 32:49.929
Uh, James went for a walk last
night and he never came back.

32:49.963 --> 32:51.463
Have you heard from him?

32:51.498 --> 32:53.165
I'm really worried about him.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.668
He's on a stakeout.

32:55.702 --> 32:56.836
Yeah.

32:56.870 --> 32:59.138
His phone probably ran out of juice is all.

32:59.172 --> 33:01.640
Oh.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.642
Right. Well, that's a relief.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.511
Thank you. No problem.

33:28.869 --> 33:31.837
Wait! Wait!

33:31.872 --> 33:33.005
Wait.

33:35.041 --> 33:36.208
Shut up.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.580
Hey, what are you doing?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.901
We're over here, you'd get a better angle.

33:45.938 --> 33:47.390
What?
You're a director now?

33:47.440 --> 33:49.202
Get fresh, I'm just saying.

33:51.865 --> 33:54.781
Hey, Butch!

33:54.831 --> 33:55.923
Harvey.

33:56.978 --> 33:58.330
Who told you we'd be here?

33:58.355 --> 34:00.514
Everybody knows this is where you...

34:00.714 --> 34:02.753
Take your problems.

34:03.151 --> 34:04.485
That's my partner you got there.

34:04.519 --> 34:06.253
Ex-partner.

34:06.287 --> 34:08.422
Oh.

34:08.456 --> 34:10.123
Let me talk to Fish.

34:11.693 --> 34:14.962
I'm not afraid of death
so much as I am of dying.

34:14.996 --> 34:17.697
I, um... I want to die how my father died,

34:17.732 --> 34:19.132
peacefully in his sleep.

34:19.167 --> 34:21.835
Not like his screaming,
terrified passengers.

34:21.870 --> 34:23.704
(laughing)

34:23.737 --> 34:26.507
(cell phone ringing)

34:27.542 --> 34:29.309
Yeah?

34:29.344 --> 34:31.043
Yeah. Bullock showed up at the plant.

34:31.079 --> 34:32.813
- Wants to talk to you.
- MOONEY: Put him on.

34:32.847 --> 34:34.947
Give me a moment, kid.

34:34.983 --> 34:36.116
You're doing good.

34:37.485 --> 34:39.319
- BULLOCK: Fish?
- Speaking.

34:39.353 --> 34:40.821
Don't be like that.

34:40.855 --> 34:42.688
Listen, you got to let my boy go.

34:42.724 --> 34:44.257
How long we been friends?

34:44.292 --> 34:46.760
For a long time, until today.

34:46.795 --> 34:48.929
I did a big favor for
you and your little pals,

34:48.963 --> 34:51.331
and now it's all about
to blow up in my face

34:51.366 --> 34:52.833
on account of your stupidity.

34:52.867 --> 34:54.601
Look, the kid's not your problem here.

34:54.636 --> 34:56.370
He was hipped to the frame by Major Crimes.

34:56.404 --> 34:57.704
They're gonna be coming after you.

34:57.739 --> 35:00.340
How did they get onto me?

35:00.375 --> 35:02.376
Usual way, I guess.

35:02.410 --> 35:03.944
Somebody talked.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.879
Huh. Not one of my people.

35:05.914 --> 35:07.214
That's what everybody says.

35:10.084 --> 35:11.752
True.

35:11.786 --> 35:14.154
Listen, you got to let my boy go. Hmm?

35:14.189 --> 35:16.690
You kill my partner, I
got to come after you.

35:16.724 --> 35:18.358
(chuckles)

35:18.393 --> 35:20.694
I don't want to do it,
but how am I gonna look,

35:20.728 --> 35:22.863
you kill my partner, I don't make a move?

35:22.897 --> 35:24.531
All right.

35:24.566 --> 35:27.534
Well, you have to promise me that
you'll keep him under control.

35:27.569 --> 35:29.369
- I promise.
- MOONEY: Cool.

35:29.404 --> 35:31.271
Put Butch on, please.

35:35.577 --> 35:36.743
Yeah, boss?

35:36.778 --> 35:38.812
That son of a bitch just threatened me.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.447
You hang him up with his partner.

35:40.482 --> 35:41.882
You got it.

35:41.916 --> 35:42.916
(sighs)

35:42.951 --> 35:44.218
Hey, how you doing?

35:44.252 --> 35:46.386
I'm good. We're going home.

35:46.421 --> 35:48.122
- Yeah?
- Gentlemen,

35:48.156 --> 35:49.756
I'm just glad everything could work out...

35:50.492 --> 35:52.526
Cops.

35:55.063 --> 35:57.397
Bless your heart.

35:57.432 --> 36:00.601
Would you be a sweet boy and rub my feet?

36:05.006 --> 36:08.642
Give me a moment, darling. I
haven't forgotten about you.

36:08.676 --> 36:10.144
I like you. You're funny.

36:10.178 --> 36:12.446
(chuckles)

36:14.249 --> 36:16.750
Now, this amateur nonsense is a good sign.

36:16.785 --> 36:19.453
There used to be some discipline.

36:19.487 --> 36:22.222
Falcone is getting old and soft.

36:22.257 --> 36:23.924
It's time.

36:23.958 --> 36:26.493
Somebody has to take over;
it might as well be me.

36:26.528 --> 36:28.095
Yes, it might as well.

36:28.129 --> 36:32.566
And you, you're like a son
to me, you know that, Oswald?

36:32.600 --> 36:34.501
I feel that way also.

36:34.536 --> 36:37.104
Which is what I don't understand.

36:37.138 --> 36:39.406
After all I've done for you,

36:39.441 --> 36:42.276
and right when I'm on
the verge of great things,

36:42.310 --> 36:44.144
you betray me.

36:44.179 --> 36:46.647
Why would you betray your mother?

36:46.681 --> 36:48.916
I-I... I don't know what you mean.

36:48.950 --> 36:50.851
It was you.

36:50.885 --> 36:52.653
(sighs)

36:52.687 --> 36:54.988
You snitched to the MCU.

36:55.023 --> 36:57.658
You want to know how I know?

36:57.692 --> 37:00.594
Because only you saw me with the pearls.

37:00.628 --> 37:02.763
No one else.

37:06.868 --> 37:08.469
It was Gilzean.

37:08.503 --> 37:10.003
He's the snitch.

37:10.038 --> 37:11.171
(chuckles)

37:11.206 --> 37:12.339
(clicks tongue)

37:12.373 --> 37:14.308
No.

37:14.342 --> 37:17.277
- Gilzean is loyal.
- So am I.

37:17.312 --> 37:20.447
I would open a vein right here
and now if you asked me to.

37:25.186 --> 37:27.187
Go on, then.

37:27.222 --> 37:29.022
Open one.

37:31.392 --> 37:34.828
I... I was speaking poetically.

37:34.863 --> 37:37.865
Prove it.

37:37.899 --> 37:42.970
Prove your loyalty, my little penguin.

37:44.405 --> 37:47.040
Please, Ms. Mooney.

37:47.075 --> 37:48.342
Please don't!

37:53.948 --> 37:57.317
You broke... my... heart!

37:57.352 --> 37:58.852
(Oswald screams)

38:00.388 --> 38:02.923
(sobbing)

38:05.860 --> 38:08.495
How you doing?

38:08.530 --> 38:09.930
Been better.

38:09.964 --> 38:12.599
Thanks for trying to help.

38:12.634 --> 38:14.268
Wish I hadn't.

38:14.302 --> 38:15.736
Did you just slap my hand?

38:15.770 --> 38:17.104
Hey, Butch!

38:17.138 --> 38:18.238
GILZEAN: Yeah, save your breath.

38:18.273 --> 38:19.673
Look, if it was up to me,

38:19.707 --> 38:22.242
you'd get a bullet in the
head and a decent funeral,

38:22.277 --> 38:24.244
but Fish has her ways.

38:25.447 --> 38:27.548
Yo! Frankie!

38:27.582 --> 38:29.216
Showtime.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.285
(machines whirring, alarm blaring)

38:34.756 --> 38:36.190
(groans)

38:42.664 --> 38:43.897
Oh, God!

38:58.246 --> 39:00.380
Don Falcone.

39:00.415 --> 39:04.184
Forgive me, young man, I
forget what your name is.

39:04.219 --> 39:05.719
Or perhaps I never knew it.

39:05.754 --> 39:08.122
Gilzean, sir.

39:08.156 --> 39:09.556
Gilzean.

39:09.591 --> 39:12.493
Tell Ms. Mooney she's too impetuous.

39:12.527 --> 39:16.630
If she wants to kill policemen,
she has to ask permission.

39:16.664 --> 39:18.799
Sir.

39:20.935 --> 39:22.269
(groans)

39:22.303 --> 39:25.172
There are rules.

39:26.708 --> 39:29.943
Cut them down.

39:29.978 --> 39:31.912
That's right, there are rules!

39:37.445 --> 39:39.379
It's good to meet you at last, James.

39:39.413 --> 39:42.349
I knew your father very well.

39:42.383 --> 39:45.552
Best D.A. this city ever had.

39:45.586 --> 39:48.355
He and I understood each other.

39:48.389 --> 39:51.191
There was respect,

39:51.225 --> 39:53.960
- friendship, even.
- Friendship?

39:55.696 --> 39:57.330
Trust me,

39:57.365 --> 40:00.167
that's the only reason you're alive now.

40:00.201 --> 40:02.335
Blood doesn't lie.

40:02.370 --> 40:05.138
I know that when you leave
here, you'll do the right thing.

40:05.173 --> 40:06.807
I will.

40:06.841 --> 40:10.177
- I'll tell what I know.
- Which is what?

40:10.211 --> 40:11.545
I know that you own the police department.

40:11.579 --> 40:12.712
Probably the mayor, too.

40:12.747 --> 40:16.483
And I was pretty sure that
you had the Waynes killed,

40:16.517 --> 40:18.084
but if you did,

40:18.119 --> 40:19.853
you wouldn't risk letting
me live, would you?

40:19.887 --> 40:21.721
Then again,

40:21.756 --> 40:25.625
how did Fish Mooney come to
have Martha Wayne's necklace?

40:25.660 --> 40:28.261
- A replica?
- Yes.

40:28.296 --> 40:31.498
But if you didn't have them
killed, why frame Mario Pepper?

40:32.733 --> 40:35.235
Or are you covering up for somebody else?

40:35.269 --> 40:37.404
Who knows who killed the Waynes?

40:37.438 --> 40:39.372
Some lowlife.

40:39.407 --> 40:41.575
We needed a culprit before the funeral.

40:41.609 --> 40:45.011
Pepper was sacrificed so that
the people of Gotham would see

40:45.046 --> 40:46.746
swift justice done.

40:46.781 --> 40:49.416
So they can feel safe and secure.

40:49.450 --> 40:52.018
- And that matters so much to you.
- Of course.

40:52.053 --> 40:54.087
I'm a businessman.

40:54.122 --> 40:57.257
You can't have organized
crime without law and order.

41:00.094 --> 41:01.528
I love this city,

41:01.562 --> 41:04.030
and I see it going to hell.

41:04.065 --> 41:06.900
But I won't let it fall
apart without a fight.

41:06.934 --> 41:09.936
You make a life of crime sound very noble.

41:09.971 --> 41:13.340
You have a hard head,
James, just like your father.

41:13.374 --> 41:16.510
Don't be self-righteous.
Don't be arrogant.

41:16.544 --> 41:18.145
You want me to keep quiet about all this?

41:18.179 --> 41:22.015
Gotham is on a knife
edge. What do you suppose

41:22.049 --> 41:24.451
bringing down City Hall
and the police force

41:24.485 --> 41:26.520
will do, even if you could?

41:26.554 --> 41:29.289
Would it make things better?

41:32.393 --> 41:34.728
<i>In bocca Al Lupo.</i>

41:43.471 --> 41:45.439
(thunder rumbling)

41:45.473 --> 41:47.474
(seabirds cawing)

41:52.113 --> 41:54.114
Lookit, Jim... I'm listening.

41:54.148 --> 41:57.384
I wasn't being honest with you.

41:57.418 --> 41:59.219
But you weren't ready for the truth.

41:59.253 --> 42:01.655
You didn't tell me
because you were ashamed.

42:06.127 --> 42:07.961
Why are we stopping here?

42:09.664 --> 42:12.132
No, please. Please, I beg of you!

42:12.166 --> 42:13.633
Shut up!

42:13.668 --> 42:16.002
This is the fool

42:16.037 --> 42:17.637
that snitched to Montoya and Allen.

42:17.672 --> 42:20.474
Falcone wants you to walk
him to the end of that pier

42:20.508 --> 42:22.743
and put a bullet in his head.

42:22.777 --> 42:25.178
Then everybody knows
you're with the program.

42:25.213 --> 42:26.680
(gasping)

42:29.951 --> 42:31.651
And if I don't?

42:31.686 --> 42:33.653
Then I'm supposed to take you out

42:33.688 --> 42:35.021
and him, too.

42:36.023 --> 42:38.291
And here's the thing, Jim. I like you.

42:38.326 --> 42:41.795
I might not have the stomach
to do it, but I'll try.

42:41.829 --> 42:43.463
'Cause if I don't,

42:43.498 --> 42:45.665
someone will get to you quick enough.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.502
Then they're gonna get to me
and probably Barbara as well.

42:48.536 --> 42:50.170
Who knows what you told her.

42:50.204 --> 42:51.872
I told her nothing.

42:51.906 --> 42:53.473
You think Falcone cares?

42:53.508 --> 42:54.808
Come on.

42:54.842 --> 42:56.143
You've killed people before.

42:56.177 --> 42:57.544
That was war. This is war!

42:57.578 --> 43:00.013
We're at war with scumbags like him.

43:00.048 --> 43:02.983
Sometimes in war, you got to do
a bad thing to do good, right?

43:03.017 --> 43:04.885
So do you do this bad thing

43:04.919 --> 43:06.787
or do you die and maybe your girl dies?

43:08.756 --> 43:10.657
I might be lackadaisical,

43:10.691 --> 43:11.992
hmm?

43:12.026 --> 43:13.460
But that's not a tough call.

43:15.229 --> 43:16.229
(whimpering)

43:19.600 --> 43:22.002
(grunting)

43:28.242 --> 43:29.476
Walk.

43:47.395 --> 43:50.497
Please, Mr. Gordon, just let me live.

43:50.531 --> 43:53.567
I'll do whatever you say.
I-I'll be your slave for life.

43:53.601 --> 43:55.068
Listen to me,

43:55.103 --> 43:56.870
there is a war coming.

43:56.904 --> 43:58.538
A-a terrible war.

43:58.573 --> 44:01.641
Falcone is losing his grip,
and his rivals are hungry.

44:01.676 --> 44:04.745
There-there will be chaos.
Rivers of blood in the streets.

44:04.779 --> 44:07.681
I know it! I-I can see it coming.

44:07.715 --> 44:09.816
See, I'm clever that way.

44:09.851 --> 44:11.585
And I can help you.

44:11.619 --> 44:13.387
I-I can be a spy.

44:13.421 --> 44:15.422
Shut up!

44:17.125 --> 44:19.359
Turn around.

44:20.228 --> 44:21.762
(whimpers)

44:23.064 --> 44:24.798
For God's sake, have mercy.

44:27.602 --> 44:29.770
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

44:32.907 --> 44:33.907
(gunshot, groans)

44:44.252 --> 44:46.820
Attaboy.

44:54.262 --> 44:55.962
My God, James.

44:55.997 --> 44:57.998
I've been so worried.

45:01.102 --> 45:03.103
What happened to you?

45:43.311 --> 45:44.845
Oi!

45:44.879 --> 45:47.481
Master Bruce, get your
bloody arse down off there!

45:47.515 --> 45:50.183
How many times have I told you?!

45:57.158 --> 45:59.493
Why were you up on the roof?

45:59.527 --> 46:02.195
I'm learning to conquer fear.

46:02.230 --> 46:04.731
Fear doesn't need conquering.

46:04.766 --> 46:07.000
Fear tells you where the edge is.

46:07.035 --> 46:09.069
Fear is a good thing.

46:09.103 --> 46:10.904
And you think I haven't
told him that, do you?

46:12.440 --> 46:14.441
You came here for a reason, I imagine.

46:14.475 --> 46:16.009
Yes,

46:16.044 --> 46:18.879
Mario Pepper didn't kill your parents.

46:18.913 --> 46:21.982
He was framed by the police department

46:22.016 --> 46:24.351
and the mob working together.

46:24.385 --> 46:26.753
We killed an innocent man.

46:26.788 --> 46:29.256
ALFRED: Right.

46:29.290 --> 46:31.825
- So who did it then?
- I don't know.

46:31.859 --> 46:32.926
I see.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.095
Sterling work there then, mate, isn't it?

46:35.129 --> 46:36.697
Yes.

46:36.731 --> 46:38.332
I'm sorry.

46:39.934 --> 46:42.502
Don't be.

46:43.805 --> 46:47.507
I'm glad he's still alive.

46:49.210 --> 46:51.445
I want to see him again.

46:51.479 --> 46:52.913
I'm asking you

46:52.947 --> 46:56.083
to give me a second chance.

46:56.117 --> 46:58.685
I'm going to find out who
killed your parents and why,

46:58.720 --> 47:02.122
and I'm gonna clean up the
damn police department if I can,

47:02.156 --> 47:04.424
but I can only do that from the inside.

47:04.459 --> 47:06.059
So I'm asking you

47:06.094 --> 47:08.028
to stay silent

47:08.062 --> 47:10.697
about what I've told you.

47:12.333 --> 47:14.534
Your call.

47:14.569 --> 47:17.104
Right, well, that's all
convenient, isn't it?

47:17.138 --> 47:18.972
Alfred!

47:37.992 --> 47:40.594
Thank you.

47:55.510 --> 47:57.210
(gasping)

48:11.159 --> 48:13.160
(rustling)

48:21.502 --> 48:23.103
(grunting)
