Penny:
I think the Princess could
look a bit better than that.

08:40.623 --> 08:42.211
Right. Sorry.

08:43.005 --> 08:45.076
Oh, s-sorry that's not what
I was trying to do.

08:46.664 --> 08:48.804
Come on, I look as if
I could lick my own forehead!

08:48.838 --> 08:51.220
-Uh, sorry. Let me just, um...
-Okay, okay, whatever.

08:51.254 --> 08:53.187
Just get on with
the story, please.

08:53.222 --> 08:55.017
The King was upset
she ditched her armor,

08:55.051 --> 08:56.674
but the Princess
wanted everyone else

08:56.708 --> 08:59.021
to ditch theirs, too,
and be themselves.

08:59.055 --> 09:01.541
So she invited
an impossibly handsome prince

09:01.575 --> 09:03.266
to solve the problem.

09:03.301 --> 09:07.512
Oh, prince that I love,
please us reach a decision.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.169
But the King warned him.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.688
May this decision
be right,

09:10.722 --> 09:13.587
or I will take your hand
and it won't be in marriage!

09:13.622 --> 09:16.210
And the Princess replied...Mwarfurludrup!

09:16.245 --> 09:17.764
Which was either a threat
or an angry burp,

09:17.798 --> 09:19.144
and neither was good news.

09:19.179 --> 09:21.526
So the Prince
gave his answer...

09:21.561 --> 09:23.183
in the form of a story.

09:23.217 --> 09:25.979
Once upon a time,
there was a family of cocoons

09:26.013 --> 09:28.015
living happily
on a tree branch.

09:28.050 --> 09:31.294
Then one day, one
of the cocoons broke open,

09:31.329 --> 09:33.227
and from within emerged...

09:33.262 --> 09:36.092
a beautiful butterfly!

09:36.127 --> 09:38.094
Come out of
your cocoons, guys,

09:38.129 --> 09:39.924
and be gorgeous, too.

09:39.958 --> 09:41.891
The cocoon family was fuming.

09:41.926 --> 09:43.617
You could see it
on their faces.

09:44.929 --> 09:46.689
The situation was tense,
so they called

09:46.724 --> 09:50.175
a handsome ladybug-boy to help
them resolve the problem.

09:50.210 --> 09:51.832
And you know
what the ladybug said?

[ All groan ]...there was a family of seeds

They loved it.

09:58.528 --> 09:59.599
There's no air!

09:59.633 --> 10:01.117
-Or light!
-Or sound!

10:01.152 --> 10:02.532
All: We love it!

10:02.567 --> 10:05.156
But one day, one of seeds
decided to grow,

10:05.190 --> 10:07.779
and she became
a beautiful flower.

10:07.814 --> 10:09.367
The other seeds
didn't like it

10:09.401 --> 10:12.542
so they called a handsome
gardener to solve the problem.

10:12.577 --> 10:14.337
Hey, I said handsome!

10:15.373 --> 10:18.548

what the gardener said?

and expect people

Yeah. It's like riding
