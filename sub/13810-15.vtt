THAT'S NOT FAIR!

07:54.807 --> 07:58.394
{\an5}NO, I JUST MEAN WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT
IT'S NOT SO WEIRD.

07:58.477 --> 08:01.564

NEVER KNEW ABOUT HIM.

TWISTER IS SINGING
FIRST TENOR WITH ME.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.005
ALTHOUGH WE SPLIT
FOR THE ARPEGGIOS.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.513
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

09:15.596 --> 09:19.809
{\an5}BECAUSE YOU'RE MISSING
SKATING AND SURFBOARDING
AND FUN... HELLO?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.394
JUST BECAUSE IT'S
SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T DO

09:21.477 --> 09:23.688
{\an1}DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT COOL!

09:25.690 --> 09:27.984
SO FINE, DON'T BELIEVE ME--

09:28.067 --> 09:31.237
BUT, I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU BETTER GET OFF THE STAGE!

09:34.782 --> 09:37.827
I JUST WISH I COULD
MAKE YOU GO THROUGH WITH THIS

09:37.910 --> 09:41.831
AND YOU WOULD REALLY EMBARRASS
YOURSELF IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY!

09:41.914 --> 09:43.833
{\an5}THAT WOULD BE
AN AWESOME

FROM YOUR END.

TOO BAD THEY DON'T
GIVE A STANDING OVATION

11:22.348 --> 11:23.599
FOR PRACTICAL JOKES.

12:39.925 --> 12:40.676
CONROY JUST SAID HE WAS
GOING TO GET THE GEAR.

12:40.759 --> 12:41.343
HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT KIND.

12:41.427 --> 12:41.969
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

12:42.052 --> 12:42.887
BLACKTOP? GEAR? CONROY?

12:42.970 --> 12:43.679
SKATEBOARDING!

12:43.762 --> 12:45.014
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!

12:45.097 --> 12:46.682
UNTIL WE FIX THE FLOODING,
I'LL BE YOUR GYM TEACHER

12:46.765 --> 12:50.227
AND WE'LL BE HAVING A SPECIAL
GYM CLASS WAY OUTSIDE, YA MAN!

12:50.311 --> 12:54.148
(<i> kids cheering</i> )

12:54.231 --> 12:56.609
WHEN DO WE GET
ON OUR BOARDS AND RIDE?

12:56.692 --> 12:58.360
AFTER SCHOOL, OTTO!

12:58.444 --> 12:59.695
(<i> groans</i> )

12:59.778 --> 13:01.238
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

13:01.322 --> 13:04.783
I'LL BE TEACHING YOU A GAME
FROM MY NATIVE JAMAICA.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.077
IT'S A GAME WE PLAYED
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE ONE

13:07.161 --> 13:08.162
LIKE YOURSELVES.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.414
{\an1}I WONDER WHAT EXOTIC
SPORT IT COULD BE?

13:10.498 --> 13:11.248
I VOTE
FOR SKATEBOARDING.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.249
WE KNOW.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.959
JUST SAYING.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.713
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ANCIENT
GAME OF KICKBALL.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.048
KICKBALL?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.717
WE PLAYED THAT ALL THE TIME
BACK IN KANSAS.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.635
AWESOME!

13:22.718 --> 13:24.386
(<i> bored</i> ):
WHOA.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.932
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, OTTO MAN,
A NEW SPORT TO DOMINATE!

13:28.015 --> 13:29.308
OH, YEAH, COOL.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.976
{\an1}ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE PLAN.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.355
WE WILL TRY OUT DIFFERENT TEAM
CAPTAINS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.523
AT THE END OF TRYOUTS

13:35.606 --> 13:38.651
{\an4}I'LL PICK PERMANENT
CAPTAINS FOR
THE TOURNAMENT.

13:38.734 --> 13:39.735
REGGIE'S THE REF.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.987
ANY QUESTIONS?

13:42.071 --> 13:45.199
WHEN DO I GET MY TROPHY?

13:45.282 --> 13:49.912
YOUR FIRST DAY CAPTAINS ARE--
OTTO ROCKET AND SHERRY CHIN.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.705
WE'RE GOING
TO WHOMP YOU GUYS.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.750
OTTO, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.669
OKAY, I CHOOSE TWISTER.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.964
{\an1}Sherry:
TRISH, OF COURSE.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.425
UM--

14:03.509 --> 14:06.554
ROB CURTIS.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.184
{\an4}DON'T FEEL SO BAD, CHRIS,
GETTING PICKED LAST
IS A DRAG, BUT...

14:12.268 --> 14:13.102
Sherry:
I CHOSE CHRIS KLAWICKI.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.436
HUH?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.522
AAH, GEE.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.566
I GUESS... THE SQUID.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.443
SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.531
DID YOU ALL SEE MY DOUBLE?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.575
NOW, THAT'S HOW
YOU PLAY KICKBALL.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.081
(<i> cheering</i> )

14:37.376 --> 14:38.961
WHOO-HOO, SAMMY!

14:39.044 --> 14:40.713
SQUID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:40.796 --> 14:42.214
QUIT MESSING AROUND!

14:42.298 --> 14:42.965
THIS IS A REAL GAME.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.217
AND THAT WAS
A REAL HOME RUN.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.385
NO WAY!

14:46.468 --> 14:49.638
ALL THE WAY, BRO!

14:52.308 --> 14:54.143
{\an5}Sam:
HEY, TITO,
SODAS FOR EVERYONE, ON ME!

14:54.226 --> 14:58.063
{\an5}OH, SOME LITTLE CUZ
IS WALKING IN A
COOL ISLAND BREEZE.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.481
WHAT'S UP?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.900
{\an4}SAM HERE MADE THE
WINNING RUN IN
KICKBALL TODAY AT SCHOOL.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.279
AH, KICKBALL,
TRADITIONAL HAWAIIAN SPORT.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.741
ALTHOUGH, IN HAWAII WE USED
A COCONUT INSTEAD OF A BALL

15:08.824 --> 15:10.367
AND CALLED IT "OW MY."

15:10.451 --> 15:11.660
WHAT DOES "OW MY" MEAN?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.829
OW, MY ACHING FOOT!

15:13.912 --> 15:14.997
YOU TRY KICKING A COCONUT.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.961
TELL ME MORE ABOUT
THE KICKBALL TOURNAMENT, CUZ.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.339
WELL, I DON'T MIND
TELLING SAM HERE

15:23.422 --> 15:25.090
THAT WHEN I MAKE
PERMANENT TEAM CAPTAIN

15:25.174 --> 15:28.469
{\an1}I MIGHT EVEN CONSIDER HIM
AS AN EARLY DRAFT PICK.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.763
YOU WOULD? REALLY?

15:30.846 --> 15:32.306
{\an1}THAT WOULD BE
TOTALLY AWESOME!

15:32.389 --> 15:36.143
{\an1}GEE, SAM, WHAT AN HONOR TO BE
SELECTED BY THE GREAT OTTO.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.520
FOR ONCE, REGGIE, I AGREE.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.023
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!

15:43.525 --> 15:44.902
Otto:
OH, MAN, THIS IS PERFECT.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.028
THESE GUYS ARE LAME.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.614
I'LL BE CAPTAIN
IN THE FINALS FOR SURE.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.074
EDDIE, GO AHEAD.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.786
SO, EDDIE, HERE'S WHO
YOU SHOULD PICK SECOND.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.454
I'LL TAKE SAM DULLARD.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.789
WHAT?

15:56.872 --> 15:59.667
SAM, GO UP, MAN,
YOU GOT PICKED FIRST!

15:59.750 --> 16:01.460
ME? PICKED FIRST?

16:01.543 --> 16:03.921
DON'T PASS OUT.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.422
DON'T PASS OUT.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.757
ISN'T THAT COOL?

16:06.840 --> 16:09.677
IS THIS OPPOSITE DAY
AND NOBODY TOLD ME?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.721
GET REAL, EDDIE'S JUST
DOING HIM A FAVOR.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.640
LIGHTEN UP, ROCKET BOY.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.892
CAN'T YOU JUST BE
HAPPY FOR SAM?

16:16.975 --> 16:17.893
{\an1}ALL RIGHT.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.187
YAY, SAM.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.565
SO, I SAY WE DO
THE LEOPARD LOOP COASTER NEXT

16:23.649 --> 16:27.569
AND THEN THE LOG JAMMER.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.697
{\an1}I THINK THIS KICKBALL THING
IS GOING TO THE SQUID'S HEAD.

16:29.780 --> 16:33.117
COME ON, LET'S HIT IT!

16:35.202 --> 16:36.036
{\an1}UH, SAM?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.414
{\an1}DOESN'T THIS RIDE
FREAK YOU OUT?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.081
OH, YEAH, AH...

16:40.833 --> 16:43.085
WHO'S GOING TO JOIN ME?

16:48.924 --> 16:51.593
(<i> screaming and cheering</i> )

16:54.388 --> 16:56.056
{\an5}Conroy:
WELL, BOYS AND GIRLS,
THE TIME IS UPON US.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.934
I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE
TEAM CAPTAINS

16:59.017 --> 17:00.602
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.729
THEY ARE...

17:01.812 --> 17:03.689
OTTO ROCKET, OTTO ROCKET,
OTTO ROCKET...

17:03.772 --> 17:06.316
Conroy:
SHERRY CHIN!

17:08.527 --> 17:09.611
{\an1}AND...

17:09.694 --> 17:10.445
OTTO, OTTO, OTTO, OTTO, OTTO.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.614
SAM DULLARD.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700
NO WAY!

17:16.201 --> 17:17.786
I MEAN, WAY
TO GO, SAM.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.126
NICE SPORTSMANSHIP, OTTO.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.627
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.296
THIS STINKS ON ICE!

17:27.378 --> 17:30.340
RELAX, DUDE, THE SQUID'S
GOING TO PICK YOU AND ME

17:30.424 --> 17:33.802
{\an1}AND THEN WE CAN RUN
THE TEAM THE WAY WE WANT.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.431
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

17:37.514 --> 17:39.933
SAM, GO AHEAD
AND PICK.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.937
Sam:
I PICK...

17:45.814 --> 17:47.191
I PICK...

17:51.069 --> 17:52.571
TRISH!

17:52.654 --> 17:56.325
A GIRL? HE WENT AHEAD AND
PICKED A GIRL INSTEAD OF ME.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.993
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.663
NOTHING.

18:04.082 --> 18:08.003
TWISTER RODRIGUEZ, COME ON DOWN!

18:08.086 --> 18:10.631
{\an1}YES, I GOT PICKED
FOR SAM'S TEAM!

18:10.714 --> 18:13.884
OOPS, SORRY, MAN.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.677
OTTO ROCKET.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.054
SQUID'S A TRAITOR!

18:17.137 --> 18:20.349
AFTER ALL I'VE DONE
FOR THAT LITTLE DWEEB.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.141
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!

18:21.225 --> 18:23.393
I'M SURE HE HAS A GOOD REASON.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.688
WHAT REASON COULD THERE BE
TO TURN HIS BACK ON ME?

18:26.772 --> 18:27.940
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.276
LIKE WHEN <i> YOU</i> NEVER
PICKED HIM FOR A TEAM?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.904
HE IS GOING TO WISH
HE WAS NEVER MADE CAPTAIN.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.079
I'M THE TEAM CAPTAIN, WHOO...

18:42.162 --> 18:44.998
OTTO, WAIT UP!

18:46.500 --> 18:49.837
{\an1}HEY, I LOOKED FOR YOU AFTER,
BUT YOU ALREADY SPLIT.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.754
GOOD GAME, HUH?

18:50.838 --> 18:53.465
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
WE WON AGAINST YOU.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.261
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE,
BENEDICT SQUID.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.345
HUH?

18:58.428 --> 18:59.555
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY

18:59.638 --> 19:02.349
WITH YOUR NEW FRIENDS
ON YOUR NEW TEAM, CHAMP?

19:05.727 --> 19:08.897
BUT I... BUT--

19:18.866 --> 19:22.911
AH, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY
"SODAS ALL AROUND" CUZ?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.873
MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.500
I JUST SAID "HI" TO OTTO
AND HE TOLD ME TO GET LOST.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.836
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.338
{\an5}REGGIE TELLS ME
THIS IS ALL OVER
THE TOURNAMENT?

19:33.422 --> 19:34.298
I GUESS.

19:34.381 --> 19:34.882
WHAT DID I DO?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.467
YOU DIDN'T PICK HIM.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.969
THEN YOU BEAT HIM.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.305
OOH, BROTHER'S GOT A POINT.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.264
{\an1}SO WHAT?

19:42.347 --> 19:45.058
YOU GUYS PICK SAM
LAST EVERY TIME.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.935
OOH, WAHINI'S
GOT A POINT.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.522
{\an4}BUT I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER
THE BEST TEAM.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.983
{\an1}I WASN'T TRYING TO HURT
HIS FEELINGS.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.194
OH, BROTHER'S GOT A...

19:56.278 --> 19:57.446
UM, NEVER MIND.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.698
MAYBE YOUR FEELINGS
WEREN'T HURT BEFORE

19:59.781 --> 20:02.451
{\an1}BECAUSE SPORTS DON'T MEAN
AS MUCH TO YOU, SAM.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.994
BUT THEY DO TO OTTO.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.039
AND I WAS SO WRAPPED UP
IN WINNING, I DIDN'T THINK.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.417
HAPPENS TO ME
ALL THE TIME, OH.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.338
THE THING I HATE THE MOST IS
WHEN MY FRIENDS ARE MAD AT ME.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.797
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

20:15.881 --> 20:16.965
YOU GUYS HANG OUT.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.093
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A LITTLE RIDE.

20:24.014 --> 20:24.806
HEY, REGGIE.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.892
LISTEN, OTTO,
I WAS TALKING TO SAM.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.435
SAM? I DON'T KNOW ANY SAM.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.396
Reggie:
SURE YOU DO.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.482
HE'S THE GUY YOU
PICKED LAST IN KICKBALL.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.610
THE GUY YOU LEAVE BEHIND
WHEN WE ROLLERBLADE THE PIER

20:36.693 --> 20:37.361
AND MAKE HIM CATCH UP?

20:37.444 --> 20:38.987
THE GUY YOU CALLED A PUCK BRAIN

20:39.071 --> 20:41.365
WHEN HE FELL
DURING STREET HOCKEY.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.411
WHOA!

20:46.495 --> 20:49.456
YOU KNOW, THAT SAM.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.752
I GUESS HE WAS
GETTING US BACK FOR ALL THAT.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.836
GUESS AGAIN, HE WASN'T.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.172
HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO HAVE THE BEST TEAM.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.840
{\an1}THAT WAS A LITTLE SELFISH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.634
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

21:00.717 --> 21:03.220
THE SAME THING.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.888
WHAT CAN I SAY?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.975
{\an1}I SAY WE GET SAM AND
GO PLAY A GAME OF KICKBALL.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.310
BUT THIS TIME,
IT'S JUST FOR FUN.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.854
COUNT ME IN!

IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY,
WE'LL HOLD HIM.

21:36.503 --> 21:40.507
ONE MORE POINT AND THEY WIN,
COME ON, GUYS!

21:40.590 --> 21:41.717

22:22.007 --> 22:26.636
All:
BUST!

22:28.722 --> 22:30.849

HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.395

22:35.479 --> 22:36.480
YOU WERE EATING DIRT.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.942
I THINK I WAS
EATING OTTO'S SHOES.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.154
I SAY WE GO TO THE SHACK
TO CELEBRATE.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.365
CELEBRATE WHAT? WE LOST!

22:46.448 --> 22:49.284
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.661
SODA FOR THE LOSERS, ON ME.
