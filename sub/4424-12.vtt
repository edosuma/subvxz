Okay, children.
Let's take our seats.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.624
We have a new student
joining us today

00:40.750 --> 00:42.960
who has just moved here
from Utah.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.464
I want you all to say hi
to Gary!

00:48.174 --> 00:50.217
Hello, everybody. It's really
great to meet you all.

00:50.342 --> 00:53.763
Gary was state champion
in wrestling <i>and</i> in tennis.

00:53.888 --> 00:54.930
He also maintained

00:55.056 --> 00:57.558
a 4.0 grade-point average
at his old school

00:57.683 --> 01:00.978
and has been on two national
commercials for toothpaste.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.688
I'm really excited
to live in this town

01:02.813 --> 01:04.732
and share all kinds
of great experiences with you,

01:04.857 --> 01:06.233
my new friends.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.818
Oh, dude, what a little asshole.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.028
Yeah.
Screw that kid.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.572
All right, Gary, why don't
you take that empty seat,

01:11.697 --> 01:13.741
and we'll get started
with the lesson?

01:16.368 --> 01:18.329
Hey.
My name's Gary.

Hi! My name's Yura --
Yura Fag.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.252
That's funny.
You're cool, man.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.171
Okay, now, who can
tell me what year

01:27.296 --> 01:29.590
the first astronauts landed
on the moon?

01:29.715 --> 01:31.634
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
1969.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.594
Very good, Gary.

01:33.719 --> 01:34.470
Wow.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.389
Looks like I don't have
a class full of retards anymore,

01:37.515 --> 01:39.225
doesn't it, children?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.437
Dude, that new kid
is such a douche.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.356
Yeah. Somebody needs to
put him in his place.

01:45.481 --> 01:47.399
He's a pecker face.
That's what he is.

01:47.525 --> 01:48.776
Go kick his ass, Stan.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.236
Yeah.
Go kick his ass.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.529
Well, maybe he won't fight.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.239
Will he bleed?
That's all we care about.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.156
Come on, dude.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.283
Somebody needs to wipe
that fucking smirk off his face.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.368
Yeah.
Little bitch.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.078
All right.
I'm gonna go kick his ass.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.164

02:02.289 --> 02:05.084

02:06.710 --> 02:08.963
Oh, hey, there. You want to kick
the ball around with me?

02:09.088 --> 02:12.258
No.
I'm...I'm gonna kick your ass.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.134
Excuse me?

02:13.259 --> 02:16.262
I'm gonna kick your ass...bitch.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.597
How come you want to fight me?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.975
Oh, I get it.
I'm the new kid.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.102
Yeah.
I guess maybe I deserve it.

02:23.686 --> 02:24.645
Huh?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.397
It's really tough
being in a totally new place,

02:26.522 --> 02:28.691
but I think all you guys
are really cool, so...

02:28.816 --> 02:30.985
I understand
if there's initiation rites.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.195
Dude, stop it.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.655
Let him have it, Stan!

02:34.780 --> 02:35.990
Shut up, Butters!

02:36.115 --> 02:37.408
The other kids are watching.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.785
Look, do what you got to do.
I won't fight back.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.287
I just hope
that maybe afterwards,

02:41.412 --> 02:43.414
we can try to be friends
someday.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.040
What are they doing?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.917
They're just standing there,
talking.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.130
What happened?

02:51.255 --> 02:53.966
I'm...going over to his
house for dinner tonight.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.634
What? How did that happen?

02:55.759 --> 02:58.179
He's...a really nice kid.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.639
You were supposed to kick
his ass, not lick his butthole.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.683
You're having dinner
with his family?

03:02.808 --> 03:04.852
What kind of family
has a kid like that?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.396
Okay.
My turn.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.814

- That's when we don't allow any TV

if I should be a Protestant

05:25.200 --> 05:26.243

all Native Americans were white.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.500
We all came to America
from Jerusalem,

06:14.625 --> 06:17.669
and while we were here,
we were visited by Christ.

06:17.795 --> 06:20.422
Jesus lived here in America?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.256
Yes.

were all killed

07:42.004 --> 07:42.838
Who?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.756
Shut up, turd!
We're watching "Friends"!

and Jesus.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.095

don't actually speak to people.

spoke to God and Jesus

07:56.810 --> 07:58.687

of the religions were right.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.826

is a white guy, right?

08:40.062 --> 08:41.188
Yeah.

I'm gonna go kick his ass!

08:46.318 --> 08:48.028

my fist in your ass.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.751
Well, look, my kid was just
over at your house and he, uh --

09:02.876 --> 09:04.086
Oh, you're Stan's dad!

09:04.211 --> 09:06.213
It's <i>so</i> nice
to finally meet you!

Mr. Marsh is here!

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
Uh, look,
I just want to tell you that --

09:10.008 --> 09:11.927
Oh, Mr. Marsh!
What a treat!

09:12.052 --> 09:13.762
It's so nice to meet you!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.430
Well, thanks.
Uh...

09:15.556 --> 09:16.473
Karen just finished baking

09:16.598 --> 09:19.059
the most amazing
Rice Krispie squares.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.227
With chocolate frosting.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.312
Come on out of the cold.
You got to try one.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.982
Or six.

09:25.107 --> 09:28.318
I cannot tell you how wonderful
it is to have you over.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.029
I hear you're a geologist.
That is so amazing.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.199
Look, uh, I actually came over
because I'm a little concerned

09:34.324 --> 09:36.493
about some of the things
you told my son.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.911
Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

09:38.036 --> 09:42.207
You know, about...God and stuff.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.500
Oh.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.587
Oh, boy. Y-You think we were
trying to convert him.

09:46.712 --> 09:47.421
Well, I --

09:47.546 --> 09:50.090
Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am so sorry.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.800
We just moved here from Utah,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.011
and we're so used to everyone
being Mormon that we --

09:54.136 --> 09:56.179
we forget not everyone
wants to hear about it.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.098
Oh, boy.
You must be furious.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.350
Well...no. No.
I just --

10:00.475 --> 10:02.686
You just heard your son
talking about religious ideals

10:02.811 --> 10:04.313
that aren't your own,
and you said,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.982
"Who the heck do these
people think they are?"

10:07.107 --> 10:09.067
I-I'm really, truly sorry,
Mr. Marsh.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.319
It won't happen again.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.654
You can...call me Randy.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.781
Randy, the last thing we want
is for people to think

10:14.906 --> 10:16.033
we're pushing our religion.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.701
We know there are a lot
of beliefs out there,

10:17.826 --> 10:19.077
and ours just works for us.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.579
To each his own, right?

10:20.704 --> 10:22.205
Yeah.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.707
Yeah!

10:23.832 --> 10:26.043
You know, to be honest,
I've never known any Mormons.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.378
I don't even know
what you people believe.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
Who was this Joseph Smith guy?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.007
Why did he believe
that Native Americans

10:32.132 --> 10:34.509
were actually white people
from Jerusalem?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.803
Well, because he found
ancient books <i>they</i> had written

10:36.928 --> 10:37.971
on gold plates --

10:38.096 --> 10:40.932
right where the angel Moroni
said they would be.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.439
I found them!
I found them!

10:48.023 --> 10:49.775
You're not gonna believe it,
everybody!

10:49.900 --> 10:50.942
I found them!

10:51.068 --> 10:51.985
Found what?

10:52.110 --> 10:55.280
Another New Testament
of Jesus Christ.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.282
What?

10:57.407 --> 11:00.369
Last night,
a Native American angel told me

11:00.494 --> 11:02.454
where I could find another
testament of Jesus Christ,

11:02.579 --> 11:04.373
so I went out to the woods.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.459
I dug around all morning where
the angel had told me to look.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.379
Hmm. Maybe there <i>isn't</i> anything
out here.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.589
Wait a tick. What's this?

11:14.549 --> 11:15.384
Wow.

11:15.509 --> 11:19.763
Inside the stone box,
I found the magical seer stones.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.057
Under that,
I found four gold plates

11:22.182 --> 11:23.975
written in strange writing.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.728
This must be the gospel
that Jesus told the Nephites.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.648
Well, they were the most amazing
things I had ever gazed upon.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.483
Well, s-so where are they?

11:31.608 --> 11:32.526
Where are what?

11:32.651 --> 11:35.237
The gold plates and the seer stones.
Where are they?

11:35.362 --> 11:36.405
Oh.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.573
Oh. Well, I was not allowed
to take them.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.826
You see,
after I found the plates,

11:40.951 --> 11:43.036
the angel Moroni
appeared to me again

11:43.161 --> 11:45.247
and said that I am not allowed
to show the plates

11:45.372 --> 11:49.209
or the seer stones to anybody,
because first I must translate

11:49.334 --> 11:51.044

this guy Joseph Smith

12:26.079 --> 12:28.749
found a new testament to the

12:28.874 --> 12:30.083

that the Harrisons

too.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.887

That does it.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.223

last night with the new kid?

12:49.644 --> 12:51.271
Shut up, dude.
They're a nice family.

Can't I have other friends?

Stan, I remember you said last night
you'd lost your wallet,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.331
so I made you a new one.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.417
I carved a picture of John Elway
into the leather on the front.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.919
Wow.
You made this?

13:14.044 --> 13:16.755

Sure.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.956
What happened after he found
the golden plates buried in the ground?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.292
Well, he kept them hidden
from everyone like he was told,

14:35.417 --> 14:37.168
and then he translated
what was written on the plates

14:37.294 --> 14:38.503

And you must be Stan's sister.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.276
Oh, I think your brother's
the greatest.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.403
My brother is a stupid turd.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.530
Hey, Stan!
- Hey, Gary.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.449
Well, come on in
and sit down, everybody.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.034
You're here just in time.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.619
My son was having a little
problem with our new religion.

17:16.745 --> 17:17.454
Dad.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.913
Oh, really?

17:19.039 --> 17:21.416
Well, that's just because
he hasn't heard the best part

17:21.541 --> 17:23.126
about the Joseph Smith story --

17:23.251 --> 17:25.503
the one that proves
he was for real.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.256
Ooh.
What's that?

17:28.381 --> 17:31.384
Well, you remember
Martin Harris, the rich man

17:31.509 --> 17:34.095
who wrote down what Joseph Smith
read out of the hat?

17:34.220 --> 17:34.721
Yeah.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.390
See, after he was done,
he took some of the pages

17:37.515 --> 17:40.185
of what would become
the Book of Mormon home.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.437
♪ Martin went home to his wife ♪

17:42.562 --> 17:44.230
♪ Dum dum dum dum dum ♪

17:44.355 --> 17:46.691
♪ And showed her pages
from the Book of Mormon ♪

17:46.816 --> 17:48.902
♪ Dum dum dum dum dum ♪

17:49.027 --> 17:51.780
A-And so Joseph Smith
put his head into a hat

17:51.905 --> 17:54.115
a-and read to me
what the golden plates said.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.619
I wrote it all down, and we're
gonna publish it into a book.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.747
Martin, how do you know
he isn't just making stuff up

18:00.872 --> 18:03.625
and pretending he's translating
off golden plates?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.710
♪ Lucy Harris,
smart, smart, smart ♪

18:05.835 --> 18:07.754
♪ Smart, smart, smart,
smart, smart ♪

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
Why would he make it up?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.092
♪ Martin Harris, dum da dum ♪

18:12.217 --> 18:14.761
All right. Here.
I'm gonna hide these pages.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.805
If Joseph Smith
really <i>is</i> translating

18:16.930 --> 18:19.140
off of golden plates,
he'll be able to do it again.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.267
But if Joseph Smith
is making it all up,

18:21.392 --> 18:23.478
the new translations
will be different from these.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.021
Okay.
Fine.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.815
I bet he'll have no problem.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.109
♪ Lucy Harris,
smart, smart, smart ♪

18:29.234 --> 18:31.152
♪ Martin Harris, dum ♪

18:31.277 --> 18:33.113

he needed to go pray ♪

18:39.619 --> 18:42.038
♪ Dum dum dum dum dum ♪

18:42.163 --> 18:45.542
Look, I'm sorry about losing
the pages we worked on, Joe,

18:45.667 --> 18:47.293
but I'm ready
to write it all down again

18:47.418 --> 18:49.003
if you'd translate
from the plates.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.590
I would love to, Martin,
except...I just had a vision.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.009
And the Lord said
he is very angry with me

18:55.135 --> 18:56.553
for letting you take
those pages.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.138
He is?

18:58.263 --> 19:00.140
♪ Dum dum dum dum dum ♪

19:00.265 --> 19:00.849
Yes.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.601
He is so mad that
he will never let me translate

19:03.726 --> 19:05.145
from the plate of Lehi again.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.398
He said we must now translate
from the plate of Nephi.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.650
So it will be
the same basic story

19:10.775 --> 19:12.193
but written
a little differently.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.195
Wow!

19:14.320 --> 19:15.905
If God got angry with you,

19:16.030 --> 19:17.824
then you must be telling
the truth!

19:17.949 --> 19:20.201
♪ Dum dum dum dum dum dum dum ♪

19:20.326 --> 19:22.162
All right, Martin.
Let's get to work.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.750
And that's how it happened.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.669
Yeah!
- All right!

19:32.130 --> 19:32.755
Wait.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.549
Mormons actually know
this story,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.801
and they still believe
Joseph Smith was a prophet?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.387
Well, sure!
The story proves it, doesn't it?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.181
No, it proves he <i>did</i>
make it all up.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.182
Are you blind?

19:42.307 --> 19:44.225
Well, Stan,
it's all a matter of faith.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.476
No.
It's a matter of logic.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.312
If you're gonna say things
that have been proven wrong,

19:47.437 --> 19:49.272
like that the first man
and woman lived in Missouri

19:49.397 --> 19:51.107
and that Native Americans
came from Jerusalem,

19:51.232 --> 19:52.734
then you'd better have something
to back it up.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.903
All you've got are a bunch
of stories about some asswipe

19:55.028 --> 19:56.654
who read plates
nobody ever saw out of a hat

19:56.779 --> 19:59.073
and couldn't do it again when
the translations were hidden!

19:59.199 --> 20:01.701
Hey, Stan.
Don't denounce our religion.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.578
I don't want to be Mormon, Dad!

20:03.703 --> 20:05.079
Me neither.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.414
That's totally cool, guys.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.832
You can believe
whatever you want!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.918
Yeah! It's great you have
your own beliefs!

20:10.043 --> 20:10.919
Yeah!
- All right!

20:11.044 --> 20:12.212
Yay for the Marshes!

20:12.337 --> 20:14.297
Oh, stop it!
That's another thing!

20:14.422 --> 20:16.007
Why do you have to be
so freakin' nice all the time?

20:16.132 --> 20:16.925
It isn't normal!

20:17.050 --> 20:19.093
You just weasel people
into your way of thinking

20:19.219 --> 20:20.595
by acting like the happiest
family in the world

20:20.720 --> 20:21.721
and being so nice to everyone

20:21.846 --> 20:24.474
that you just blindside
dumb people like my dad!

20:24.599 --> 20:25.975
Yeah!

20:31.105 --> 20:32.732
Well, kids...

20:32.857 --> 20:34.817
who's up for
a water-balloon fight?!

20:34.943 --> 20:35.860
Yeah!
- Awesome!

20:35.985 --> 20:36.986
All right!
- Can't wait!

20:37.111 --> 20:38.488
Water-balloon fight!

20:41.199 --> 20:43.368
Oh, hey, Stan.
Where's your best buddy, Gary?

20:43.493 --> 20:45.286
I'm not hanging around
that kid anymore.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.163
Oh, no.
You guys broke up?

20:47.288 --> 20:49.207
You guys were right, okay?
The new kid's a douche.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.043
Now I just got to find a way
to keep him away from me.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.836
Hey, Stan.
- Oh, brother.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.089
Uh-oh!
The jilted lover returns.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.715
I just wanted to let you know
you don't have to worry

20:57.840 --> 20:59.342
about me trying to be
your friend anymore.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.301
I don't?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.470
Look, maybe us Mormons
do believe in crazy stories

21:02.595 --> 21:03.846
that make absolutely no sense.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.890
And maybe Joseph Smith
did make it all up.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.142
But I have a great life
and a great family,

21:08.268 --> 21:10.144
and I have the Book of Mormon
to thank for that.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.022
The truth is, I don't care
if Joseph Smith made it all up,

21:13.147 --> 21:14.649
because what the church
teaches now

21:14.774 --> 21:17.026
is loving your family,
being nice, and helping people.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.570
And even though people in this
town might think that's stupid,

21:19.696 --> 21:21.197
I still choose to believe in it.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.449
All I ever did was try to be
your friend, Stan.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.951
But you're so high and mighty,
you couldn't

21:25.076 --> 21:26.661
look past my religion
and just be my friend back.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.121
You got a lot of growing up
to do, buddy.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.205
Suck my balls.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.879
Damn.
That kid is cool, huh?
