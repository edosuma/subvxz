<i>(rowdy voices and blows landed)</i>

00:44.002 --> 00:46.130
MAN: Come on, put some effort in!

00:46.838 --> 00:48.181
Come on, son!

00:48.257 --> 00:50.305
Right in the kisser!

00:50.467 --> 00:52.515
Keep moving.
That's it, son.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.476
Get your hands up, lad!

00:55.973 --> 00:58.021
Come on.
Left, right, left, right!

00:59.643 --> 01:01.691
That's it!
Come on!

01:01.812 --> 01:04.440
That's it!
Into him, Hook!

01:05.482 --> 01:08.486
Keep fucking going!
Controlled aggression.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.243
That's it, keep throwing.
One, two. One, two.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.450
Lads, keep throwing.
Good work.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.120
Take it and give it back.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.585
That's it, keep going.
Lovely.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.257
All right, time!

01:22.332 --> 01:24.710
I said, time! Fucking break 'em!

01:26.503 --> 01:27.880
Good lads.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.011
You'll do for me, boys.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.014
Back in line.
Next.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.013
Next.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.895
Welcome to the regiment.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.028
<i>Watch your footing, boys.</i>

01:45.397 --> 01:46.944
Open it up a bit.
Open it up a bit.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.276
Come on, stay with me.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.326
Stay with me.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.530
Steady.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.868
Watch it.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.456
- Keep moving.
- (laughter)

01:58.535 --> 01:59.912
Get back to your fucking feet!

02:00.871 --> 02:03.169
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.214
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.008
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.723
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.388
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.678
Do not be afraid of the water.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.935
Plough through it.
Plough through it.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.021
Pull yourself up, Thompson.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.317
Keep that head down.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.441
Nice one.
Come on, Hook.
Good work, son.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.029
That's it.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.233
Pull yourself...

02:30.567 --> 02:32.194
Come on, then, Hook.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.870
Help him out, Thompson.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.539
Help him out, Thompson.
Come on, drag him.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.243
(shouts) Up the wall, go!

02:39.910 --> 02:41.036
Go on, get up there!

02:41.119 --> 02:43.793
Come on, get your back against the wall.
Get him up there.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.169
Come on, stop messing around.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.342
Go on, get him up.
Drag him up.

02:47.417 --> 02:51.012
Go on, that's it, help each other.
Help each other! That's it.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.841
- Come on, Thommo.
- Your lives are in each other's hands.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.302
Teamwork, boys.
Teamwork.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.012
Well done, guys.
Get his knees up.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.472
Go on, keep moving!

02:59.554 --> 03:01.977
Keep it going!
Keep it going!

03:12.442 --> 03:14.536
What are you doing?
Leave him!

03:14.611 --> 03:17.034
You can send a medic back
when you reach your objective.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.833
Now get back in formation
before you get everybody killed!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.501
(gunshots)

03:24.621 --> 03:25.747
(gunshot)

03:26.623 --> 03:29.001
Hands off cocks and pull on socks!

03:29.626 --> 03:31.173
Come on, get fell in!

03:32.587 --> 03:34.635
Platoon... Platoon, 'shun!

03:37.467 --> 03:41.222
Because of the deteriorating
security situation in Belfast,

03:41.304 --> 03:45.559
your regiment is now being deployed there
on an emergency basis.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.269
Any questions?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.697
- We're not going to Germany?
- You're going to Belfast.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.991
I take it you all know
where Belfast is?

03:53.775 --> 03:56.528
Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.905
Here.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.162
You are not leaving this country.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.548
What's up wi' you?

04:58.548 --> 05:01.552
Come on, Darren, our kid, eat your food
before it gets cold, mate.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.391
'Ey up, listen...

05:09.184 --> 05:11.232
I don't want you
worried about me, OK?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.899
I'll be fine.
I promise you.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.952
- Now, come on, eat up.
- (taps tray)

05:19.027 --> 05:22.372
I'm not even leaving the country,
so you've got nothing to worry about.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.413
- Got a girlfriend?
- No.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.794
No?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.210
Let me see your teeth.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.262
You liar! (laughs)

05:48.932 --> 05:50.275
(laughs)

05:51.268 --> 05:53.396
Wa-hey-hey!

06:00.277 --> 06:02.405
Go on, then!
Go on!

06:18.295 --> 06:20.389
Right, I'll be back soon, OK?

06:20.463 --> 06:22.181
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

06:22.257 --> 06:23.804
Hug.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.055
- All children must be back by five pm.
- Go on.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.687
You of all people should remember that,
Hook.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.782
Offload.
Welcome to Ireland.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.198
Come down. I want you lining up
with your gun over there.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.743
Quickly, and up the stairs.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.870
Come on, move.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.668
Move, move, move.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.791
That's right, single file.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.215
Single file.
Drop your gun off.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.757
Right, this is where
you eat and sleep.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.430
I'll show you where
you shit in a minute.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.678
Why you look so gormless?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.475
Were you expecting the fucking Ritz?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.853
Get your kit squared away.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.976
Get a fucking brew on.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.316
You're not at the
depot now, boys.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.527
You've got to look
after yourselves.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.023
And don't worry,

08:40.102 --> 08:43.198
you'll only be staying here till one of
the Paddies shoots you anyway.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.618
Come on, hurry up and organise yourselves.
Hurry up and come inside, man!

08:47.235 --> 08:49.283
Attention!

08:51.448 --> 08:53.621
At ease.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.086
I'm Lieutenant Armitage,
your platoon commander.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.379
I um...

08:58.455 --> 09:00.583
I just wanted to
meet the new boys.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.591
- I'm a bit of a new boy myself, actually.
- (mouths)

09:04.919 --> 09:09.345
Well, looking forward to getting to know
you all over the next couple of days.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.472
Anyway, hello.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.936
(Armitage chuckles)

09:14.304 --> 09:16.352
Well, carry on.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.107
You heard what the man said.
Carry on.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.862
(coughing)

10:28.920 --> 10:31.048
You can't sleep?

10:40.223 --> 10:42.271
Ta.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.199
- Who are they?
- MRF, undercover guys.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.743
Nothing to do with us.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.963
<i>Pay attention. Now, this is basic
information but very necessary.</i>

11:07.584 --> 11:09.632
Roughly, very roughly,

11:09.878 --> 11:13.883
you can divide the city between the
Protestant Loyalist east, here in orange,

11:13.965 --> 11:15.012
friendly.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.846
And the Catholic Nationalist west
in green,

11:18.928 --> 11:20.896
hostile.

11:20.972 --> 11:25.227
Both communities have paramilitary
factions itching to get at each other.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.813
You need to be aware that
within the Republican movement

11:27.896 --> 11:30.945
we're seeing a split between
the older official IRA elements

11:31.149 --> 11:34.198
and the younger
more radical street-fighting element,

11:34.277 --> 11:35.699
the Provisionals.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.746
This is the front line, boys.

11:37.822 --> 11:42.373
Catholics and Protestants living
side by side, <i>at</i> each other's throats,

11:42.452 --> 11:44.204
divided by the Falls Road.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.632
You can use the Divis Flats
at the top of the Falls Road

11:47.916 --> 11:50.010
as an orientation point,

11:50.084 --> 11:52.382
but do not enter the flats.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.715
They've become
an IRA stronghold.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.219
Very dangerous.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.427
I think that's all.
Dismissed.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.498
Your rifle.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.008
Look lively!

12:35.004 --> 12:37.974
- Expecting a riot, Sergeant?
- I thought we should be prepared, sir.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.973
Today's operation is to assist the RUC
in conducting a house search

12:41.052 --> 12:42.269
in the Catholic community.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.723
I want berets, Sergeant.
No riot gear.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.727
- Are you sure, sir?
- We need to reassure people.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.155
We're here to protect them. We need to
look them in the eye and tell them that.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.358
Carry on.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.786
All right, boys, you heard the man.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.454
Shields and helmets back here.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.747
Berets on.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.873
<i>Come on, quick as you can! Load up.</i>

13:10.581 --> 13:12.834
Get on.
We have to move out in two minutes.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.719
We've got to reassure the Paddy.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.722
Quick.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.843
Emergency crisis my arse!

13:55.918 --> 13:58.296
Apparently the birds fucking love us
over here, lads.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.553
Mate of mine was out here last year.
"Chucking fucking knickers at us."

14:01.632 --> 14:02.758
Brilliant, mate.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.271
Looks like Leeds.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.817
(continued chatter and laughter)

14:28.117 --> 14:29.243
ARMITAGE: Stop here.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.455
Stop here, Corporal.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.968
No street signs.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.638
If that's north,
then we must be near the Falls Road.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.309
(liquid splashing)

14:56.854 --> 14:58.231
Oh!

14:58.314 --> 15:00.988
Fuck me! We must be near
the Falls Road. It's pish!

15:01.859 --> 15:04.112
Get on to HQ
and advise the road is barricaded.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.538
- (laughter)
- Quickly.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.956
You dickheads!

15:07.031 --> 15:09.659
Get out of here now, you dickheads!

15:10.535 --> 15:11.878
- Oh!
- (laughter)

15:11.953 --> 15:15.207
- Get out of here, you fucking shitbags!
- All units to double one two.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.757
Youse fucking creeps!

15:16.833 --> 15:19.052
Get out of Ireland now!

15:19.127 --> 15:23.052
Get out of this country!
None of us likes you!

15:23.131 --> 15:24.131
Go!

15:24.173 --> 15:25.800
Get down, get down, get down!

15:36.310 --> 15:37.937
Get into a bit of bother, lads?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.442
Follow us.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.819
Right, load up, chaps.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.026
Load up!

16:08.718 --> 16:10.766
(distant clattering)

16:13.723 --> 16:15.851
Come on.
Hurry up, hurry up.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.729
(clattering of dustbin lids)

16:27.403 --> 16:28.950
You want to make
sure you're ready.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.452
We've got to be quick.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.579
OK, boys.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.083
- Dismount!
- (clattering continues)

16:37.580 --> 16:40.504
All right, boys, you want to
cordon off the house both sides.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.802
(clattering continues)

16:43.252 --> 16:46.301
All right, boys, I want you to cordon off
both sides of the house

16:46.380 --> 16:49.759
by forming a line from this side
all the way down to this side.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.890
Move your fucking arses!

16:52.762 --> 16:55.265
(clattering drowns out shouted orders)

17:11.821 --> 17:12.948
Move!

17:15.910 --> 17:18.003
(shouting and clattering continues)

17:20.998 --> 17:22.500
Move your fucking arses!

17:25.461 --> 17:27.589
The guns, where are they?

17:28.089 --> 17:30.638
Where are the fucking guns,
you Fenian bitch?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.890
You're with me, come here.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.221
There are no
guns in this house!

17:34.303 --> 17:37.477
Don't you be fucking lying!
Where's the fucking guns?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.143
Where's the fucking guns?

17:42.979 --> 17:45.232
Right, just stay fucking there.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.567
Stay there.
Just stay there.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.573
That'll do.
That'll do there, thank you.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.451
That'll do there, pal.
Stay back, please, there's a good lad.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.998
Hey, it's just a search!

17:55.825 --> 17:57.577
It's just a stop-and-search.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.128
(overlapping voices)

18:00.955 --> 18:03.754
You don't want to be here.
Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck...

18:03.833 --> 18:05.676
Let me the fuck through!

18:07.336 --> 18:09.634
Just stay there.
Just fucking calm down. Stay there.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.342
(overlapping angry voices)

18:14.677 --> 18:17.351
- It's just a search.
- Just stay there, please.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.478
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop touching us!

18:28.566 --> 18:30.660
(shouting intensifies)

18:30.735 --> 18:32.157
Hey, hey, back it up!

18:32.236 --> 18:35.035
It's got nothing to do with us,
just fucking stay there!

18:39.827 --> 18:42.125
Hey, where's the fucking Lieutenant?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.878
- Find him! Tell him we need more men!
- Yes, Corporal.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.672
...where the fucking guns are!

18:51.047 --> 18:53.516
For God's sake,
will you never leave us alone?

18:53.591 --> 18:55.559
Shut your fucking mouth!

18:55.843 --> 18:56.969
Rip it apart.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.523
- You'll find no guns in this house!
- Shut your fucking mouth!

19:02.558 --> 19:04.981
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Where's my husband?

19:05.061 --> 19:07.109

All right?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.996
Where's the soldier at?

40:12.368 --> 40:14.496
Dunno. Said he was coming back.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.790
Didn't he take you with him?

40:21.878 --> 40:24.006
Give us a packet of crisps, Frank.

40:31.179 --> 40:33.398
How are you going to get
up for work in the morning?

40:33.473 --> 40:34.816
What?

40:34.891 --> 40:38.145
Well, you're not getting
your alarm clock back, are you?

40:41.856 --> 40:45.281
Look, it's better than having to
shoot somebody in the head.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.580
Come on,
we'll get this over and done with,

40:48.655 --> 40:50.874
then we'll be back in
time for the darts.

41:03.836 --> 41:04.883
Careful.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.100
What are you doing?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.454
(crashing)

42:21.914 --> 42:23.416
MAN:
Can I have some help, please?

42:23.499 --> 42:25.126
(coughs)

42:26.627 --> 42:28.129
Let's have some help here.

42:30.798 --> 42:31.845
Oh...

43:08.503 --> 43:09.550
(coughing)

43:27.897 --> 43:30.025
He's breathing.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.653
It's all right, son,
we'll get you to the hospital.

43:33.736 --> 43:34.908
Come on, where's the...?

43:34.987 --> 43:37.035
Come here!

43:40.535 --> 43:42.458
It's all right.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.585
Open the door!

44:07.562 --> 44:09.610
(overlapping voices)

45:20.801 --> 45:22.849
(voices shouting)

45:59.632 --> 46:01.680
(groans)

46:05.680 --> 46:08.650
I thought you'd been through
the explosives handling drill with 'em.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.442
I did, sir, a hundred fucking times.

46:10.518 --> 46:12.566
They're <i>as</i> thick as fuck.

46:13.187 --> 46:14.939
Did he see the bomb?

46:15.022 --> 46:17.650
- Did he see the fucking bomb?
- Yes, he saw the bomb.

46:20.403 --> 46:22.747
There's no way he
could survive that, sir.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.261
- Leave him be.
- We can't.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.056
We don't know him.

46:45.886 --> 46:48.014
We can't just leave him.

46:49.056 --> 46:50.182
- Come on.
- Da.

46:50.266 --> 46:51.859
- Help me.
- Oh, God.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.522
Careful.

46:59.066 --> 47:01.194
Jesus.

47:27.636 --> 47:28.979
Come on.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.682
Come on.

47:31.766 --> 47:33.359
No, your room.
Your room.

47:33.434 --> 47:35.562
Go on.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.152
OK.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.279
Careful.
Careful.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.028
OK.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.158
Get his jumper off.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.745
Da, stop.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.792
He's a soldier.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.417
We can't help him.

47:58.334 --> 48:00.336
We have to.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.171
We can take him
to the hospital.

48:02.254 --> 48:04.473
It's too dangerous.
And not just for him.

48:05.174 --> 48:08.303
If we get seen taking a
soldier to the hospital...

48:12.139 --> 48:14.187
Come on.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.482
Come on.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.045
Jesus fucking Christ!

48:42.503 --> 48:46.224
So we can't shoot a fucking soldier but
you can blow up a pub on the Shankill?

48:49.552 --> 48:51.395
- It's nothing to do with me.
- Nothing?

48:51.470 --> 48:53.188
- It wasn't us.
- Ah, so who was it?

48:54.557 --> 48:57.060
- It wasn't you, no?
- No.

48:58.978 --> 49:02.073
- You sure about that?
- Of course I'm fucking sure.

49:02.148 --> 49:03.821
So where the fuck
have you been all day?

49:05.484 --> 49:08.488
We were driving about
looking for that other soldier.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.083
I told you to stand down.

49:13.159 --> 49:14.957
Well, we didn't.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.208
You better hope he didn't
get a good look at youse.

49:17.538 --> 49:20.838
He'll be sitting in the Palace Barracks
going through those photo albums.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.668
They've got your
photo down there, too.

49:22.751 --> 49:25.004
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

49:25.546 --> 49:27.594
Cheeky bastard.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.810
Fuck's sake, lads.

49:30.885 --> 49:33.229
- There has to be discipline.
- Fuck discipline.

49:34.013 --> 49:35.013
Relax.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.183
Jimmy.

49:37.725 --> 49:42.526
Next time you disobey my orders,
I can't protect you.

49:42.855 --> 49:44.903
What's that supposed to mean?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.448
What the fuck do
you think it means?

50:03.751 --> 50:06.004
What do you think?
Do you believe him?

50:06.086 --> 50:08.214
He's lying.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.929
And we're going to kill him.

50:11.091 --> 50:12.343
I'm going to get the guns.

50:12.426 --> 50:15.054
You keep an eye on him,
I'll meet you back here.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.777
Undo his shirt.

50:35.324 --> 50:37.452
OK.

50:42.790 --> 50:44.838
<i>- Oh...
- OK.</i>

50:48.420 --> 50:50.468
- Argh!
- Easy.

50:51.006 --> 50:52.929
Easy. Easy, easy.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.055
It's OK, it's OK.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.761
Help me here.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.687
Hold him.
Hold him down.

50:57.763 --> 50:59.891
- (groans in agony)
- OK, you're safe.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.351
You're safe, you're safe now.

51:01.433 --> 51:02.855
Ssh.

51:02.935 --> 51:04.983
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Ssh.

51:05.854 --> 51:08.903
- Get it done with. Dad...
- You're all right. You're all right.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.111
Here, here.
Bite this.

51:14.655 --> 51:15.872
Ssh, don't look.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.996
Don't look.

51:18.158 --> 51:20.206
It's OK, it's OK.
Don't look. Don't look.

51:21.328 --> 51:24.207
I'm not going
to lie to you.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.338
It's going to
hurt like fuck.

51:26.834 --> 51:27.881
Oh, God.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.587
- OK, hold him.
- Yeah.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.547
OK.

51:33.549 --> 51:34.971
(cries out in agony)

51:35.050 --> 51:36.302
- No, Dad!
- OK, OK.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.479
Ssh.

51:38.554 --> 51:39.806
OK.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.390
All right.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.810
- You're all right. Good man.
- Da, I can't do it.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.570
Hold him down, hold him down,
would you?

51:46.645 --> 51:48.693
- (cries out in agony)
- Ssh.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.818
That's it.
That's it.

51:52.901 --> 51:55.745
You're all right.
Good man, good man.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.869
All right.

51:58.324 --> 52:00.372
Good lad.
That's it, that's it.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.205
- No, no, no, no!
- Ssh!

52:04.705 --> 52:06.457
- Quiet!
- Ssh!

52:06.540 --> 52:09.589
It's OK, it's OK,
it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.090
- Da, I can't do it.
- It's OK.

52:11.170 --> 52:13.138
Don't look.
Don't look.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.341
Jesus Christ.

52:15.716 --> 52:17.184
Lean on him.
Put your weight on him.

52:17.259 --> 52:19.978
- I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm...
- Put your weight on him!

52:20.054 --> 52:21.226
That's it, OK.

52:22.264 --> 52:23.857
That's it.

52:23.932 --> 52:25.934
- It's OK.
- That's it.

52:26.018 --> 52:28.020
- It's OK.
- OK.

52:31.607 --> 52:34.360

52:34.443 --> 52:35.990
You're OK, you're OK.

52:36.070 --> 52:37.663
You're doing great.
It's OK.

52:37.738 --> 52:38.830
It's OK, it's OK.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.749
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

52:42.743 --> 52:44.495
You're doing great.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.205
- It's OK.
- (groans)

52:48.957 --> 52:52.131
Well, look, if he is dead,
it's problem solved, innit?

52:52.211 --> 52:53.508
Let's hope so.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.635
Hope so?

52:58.801 --> 53:00.724
What if he's not dead, Sergeant?

53:00.803 --> 53:02.555
What then, eh?
Hm?

53:04.890 --> 53:07.268
So we've got to fucking find out
if he is dead.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.907
Not now, Lieutenant, we're busy.

53:16.985 --> 53:19.033
- I wondered if you could help.
- We are busy.

53:19.113 --> 53:20.330
I do understand that, sir.

53:20.406 --> 53:22.625
Why aren't you out
there looking for him?

53:23.909 --> 53:26.583
- What?
- Why aren't you out looking for him?

53:26.662 --> 53:29.415
- Who?
- Hook. Private Hook.

53:29.748 --> 53:33.673
- You probably know where they'd take him.
- Don't you fucking dare!

53:33.752 --> 53:35.550
I'm your fucking senior officer.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.677
Stand up straight!

53:45.973 --> 53:48.817
You need to learn to control your men,
Lieutenant.

53:49.977 --> 53:53.231
I am not here to clear up
your fucking mistakes.

53:53.313 --> 53:57.819
Your men, your fucking responsibility,
not mine.

54:00.112 --> 54:01.989
I'm asking for your help.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.506
There you go.
There's my help.

54:19.381 --> 54:21.600
- Is he dead?
- We do not know.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.724
The situation is confused
to say the least.

54:25.304 --> 54:27.682
Now, if you do not mind,
we have work to do.

54:28.474 --> 54:30.522
Off you go.

54:50.662 --> 54:53.256
It's a fucking mess, Sergeant.

54:53.332 --> 54:55.380
Your fucking mess.

55:02.341 --> 55:04.389
You been in the
Army for long?

55:05.052 --> 55:06.474
No.

55:06.553 --> 55:08.897
I was in the
Army myself.

55:09.556 --> 55:11.558
Medic.

55:12.059 --> 55:13.732
20 years.

55:14.895 --> 55:20.618
Posh cunts telling thick cunts
to kill poor cunts.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.450
That's the Army for you.

55:26.532 --> 55:28.580
It's all a lie.

55:29.409 --> 55:31.537
They don't care about you.

55:33.121 --> 55:35.249
You're just a piece
of meat to them.

55:38.961 --> 55:41.089
Piece of meat.

55:42.965 --> 55:45.093
Get yourself some rest, son.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.600
Come on.

58:10.696 --> 58:12.744
D'you want me to
go and get Quinn?

58:14.074 --> 58:15.451
No.

58:16.618 --> 58:18.746
What are we going to do, then?

58:20.455 --> 58:22.583
I'll make a phone call.

58:22.749 --> 58:25.593
And you stay here.
Don't answer the door to anyone.

58:26.962 --> 58:29.181
(front door opens)

58:29.256 --> 58:31.304
(front door shuts)

58:42.894 --> 58:45.238
- I've got to go now.
- You need to rest.

58:45.313 --> 58:47.065
I've got to get back
to the barracks.

58:47.149 --> 58:49.197
It's too dangerous just now.
There's rioting.

58:49.276 --> 58:50.778
Careful, careful.

58:51.236 --> 58:53.364
Here, lie down.

58:53.447 --> 58:55.620
- (groans)
- Round that way now. Here.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.632
It's still bleeding here.

59:10.130 --> 59:12.178
Thank you.

Fuck's sake, Eamon.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.529
- Everybody's looking for him.
- I didn't know he was a soldier.

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:47.206
All right.
You did the right thing to call me.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.335
Right, I'll handle this, Brigid.
All right?

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.663
- We don't want involved in this.
- We are involved.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.295
- He can't stay here.
- Right, I won't be long.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.612
BRIGID: We should have called Quinn.
- No.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.538
It's his district now.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:30.538
If anybody finds out he's a Brit
and we're helping him...

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:32.961
- I'm going to go and get Quinn.
- You can't, Brigid.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.499
There's no talking to
these young lads.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.802
You tell Quinn, that lot...
they'll kill him.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:44.135
You understand that?

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.105
Just leave it to Boyle,
he'll sort it out.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.864
- Where's Boyle?
- He's at Divis Flats.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:11.996
Eamon McCarthy's.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.828
Get in.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.452
Sir.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.788
Does this concern my missing soldier,
Hook?

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.459
It does, doesn't it?
We'll come with you.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.756
- Not possible.
- You'll need back-up.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:44.834
All right.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:47.387
But you remember who's in charge here,
eh?

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.589
Go, John.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.478
- So where is he?
- First...

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.815
You owe me one and
I need a favour.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.067
What?

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.985
I need you to take
care of someone.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.941
Who?

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.197
James Quinn.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:55.496
All right.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.996
Now I need to get that soldier
back to the barracks.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:03.671
- So where is he?
- The Divis.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:08.047
But it's all right,
the situation's under control.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.370
Francie.
Keep an eye out.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.410
(knocking)

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:27.960
Sean?

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:30.584
- Quinn.
- Get in, Brigid. Get inside.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.421
Get in.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:40.889
Dad.

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:42.220
- Where is he?
- Dad.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.852
- Who?
- Don't play fucking games with me, Eamon.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.854
- Where is he? Where's Boyle?
- Boyle?

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:49.435
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?
I know he was here.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.943
You're hiding something from me.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:55.070
- Where is he, Brigid?
- Leave her alone.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:56.776
Shut the fuck up.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.240
And what the fuck
was Boyle doing here?

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.955
Tell me!

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.879
- Whose side are you on here, Eamon?
- He's a collaborator.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:10.457
- There's a soldier in my room.
- Brigid!

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.840
He's not here.

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.425
He was here.

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.431
- Where's the soldier?
- He was...

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.764
- Where's the fucking soldier, Eamon?
- He was here! He was here!

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.190
He was here.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.437
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:31.565
- Did Boyle take him?
- No, no, he was alone. He, he...

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.362
he must have just left.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:35.236
Go on.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:37.612
I'll be back for you later.
Come on, Sean.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.236
The Brit's here.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:41.616
- What?
- Keep an eye on them.

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:42.868
Watch the entrances!

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.421
It's OK.
It's all right. Ssh.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.624
(Brigid sobs)

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.040
Check the other side.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.993
Ssh.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.791
(receding footsteps)

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.225
(coughs)

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:27.903
If that soldier's still alive,
we need to get to him first.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:29.950
Clear up your mess.

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.029
When we get there,
you can stay out of fucking sight

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.580
and wait for my signal.

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.248
<i>Do you understand me, Lieutenant?</i>

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.449
Yes, sir.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.511
Get the gun.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.346
Sean!

01:16:44.642 --> 01:16:46.360
Get up!

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.651
Move!

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:46.371
There's no need for that.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.392
- Who is it?
- Boyle.

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:09.935
What is it?

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:11.524
- Jesus!
- Brigid!

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:13.322
- What the fuck?
- Brigid!

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.445
Brigid. Brigid.
Come on.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.991
- You're all right.
- Da. Da.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.457
Right, sit down.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:31.757
There were a soldier.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:33.004
Gary Hook.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.460
He was here earlier.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:37.004
Where is he?

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.220
You traitor.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:42.597
I understand that you
feel that way, I do.

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:49.938
But if you do not tell me what I need
to know, then I will shoot this man.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:53.146
And when I have done that,
then I will shoot you.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.948
And believe me,
I do not want to do that.

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.651
So, please, tell me where the soldier is.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.501
I don't know.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.080
He...

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.257
- One.
- He left.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.426
- Two.
- He left before Quinn got here!

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.754
Quinn was here?
Listen to me.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:19.964
I know where they'll be.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:25.845
Trust me.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.163
Move!

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.168
- Stay up here.
- No problem.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.890
Come on, Sean.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:51.768
Don't think about it.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.820
None of us want
to be doing this.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.445
We're at war here, Sean.

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:14.745
Pull the trigger.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.806
Come on, Sean.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.270
Pull it.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.860
I know you can.

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:49.280
Please.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.203
You wanted to be
a gunman, Sean?

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:56.454
This is what being
a gunman means.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.172
Pull it.

01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:05.341
Pull the trigger.

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:29.741
Sir, we got to go.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.573
He said to wait
for their signal.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:40.710
Brits!
It's the fucking Brits!

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.568
Go!

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:20.120
Sir, we've got to do something.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:22.252
We got to go, sir.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.421
Go. Go!

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.328
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.797
Medic.

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:14.633
All right, let's get you home.

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:19.642
- (chokes)
- Ssh.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.312
Shut up. Ssh.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:34.157
Ssh.

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:43.670
Shut up.
Shut up.

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:48.004
Ssh.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.129
Shut up!

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.346
(two gunshots)

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:05.358
No!

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:14.450
Down!
Put the fucking gun down!

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:15.652
Turn around.

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:17.864
Down on your fucking knees!
Now!

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.868
Put your hands
behind your head.

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:34.428
Look at me.

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:35.926
Look at me!

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:38.968
James Quinn.

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:41.930
Aye, I know your fucking name, son.

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:43.855
Boyle told me.

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:45.648
Says you're trouble.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.772
Says he wants you dead.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:55.950
You need to deal with him.
And soon.

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:58.154
You understand me?

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:00.364
Now, we can work together.

01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:03.333
I'm a reasonable man.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:05.536
Do you understand?

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:06.836
Get up.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:09.040
Up!

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.298
Go on, off you go.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.844
Go!

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:18.924
Hey.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.640
I'll be in touch.

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.053
<i>CO:
Lieutenant Armitage has come to me</i>

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:42.554
<i>with some concerns about
certain incidents that occurred
during the operation.</i>

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:46.095
<i>MRF MAN: With respect, sir, I have
my own concerns about the Lieutenant.</i>

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:49.432
<i>Because of his mistakes, I have had to
neglect my own operation,</i>

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:51.983
<i>redeploy my own men to go and look
for his missing soldier,</i>

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:53.981
<i>a soldier he left behind earlier that day.</i>

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.437
<i>ARMITAGE:
I have a duty of care.</i>

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.614
<i>MRF MAN: I also have a duty of care,
sir, to my men,</i>

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.612
<i>one of whom happens to be dead now.</i>

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:00.943
<i>But we are at war here, sir.</i>

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:04.530
<i>- Does he understand that?
- We're not at war with our own side.</i>

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.283
<i>- I know what I saw.
- I don't care what he saw, sir.</i>

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:09.413
<i>What he thinks he saw.
He's wrong.</i>

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:10.995
ARMITAGE:
Sir...

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.956
Sergeant Lewis was attempting
to murder Hook. I saw it.

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:17.259
- No. He was trying to restrain him.
- He was not restraining him.

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:20.087
Hook panicked.
Probably went for his weapon.

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:22.264
Sergeant Lewis
would have tried to disarm him.

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:25.593
Because of this, he was shot,
he was killed. It happens.

01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:27.973
CO: It was a confused situation.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:31.307
- Sir, with respect, I know what I saw.
- I want you to listen to me, Lieutenant.

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:33.437
This is very important.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.728
It was a confused situation.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:40.281
In these circumstances, what you saw,
what you think you saw,

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:43.281
can be a very different thing
to what actually happened.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.577
Do you understand?

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:47.285
Do you understand?

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.037
Yes, sir.

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:52.078
I'll show him in, sir.

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:56.540
Hook, in.

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:08.427
At ease, Private.

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:11.187
Now, your Lieutenant has come to me

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:13.516
and told me about
how you're feeling at the moment.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.475
You've had quite an experience.

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:17.937
I think we can all agree
that you've been lucky.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:21.023
You're very lucky to be alive.

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:24.531
It's only down to the actions of the
Captain and his men that you were saved.

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:26.361
A very good soldier
died in the process.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:29.823
- What about Private Thompson, sir?
- Don't you bloody dare!

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:32.371
You've been through
a very testing ordeal.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:36.000
The best thing in this situation
is to try and put it behind you.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.418
Do you understand me?

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:38.749
Yes, sir.

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:45.631
We look after our own
in the Army, Hook.

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.428
- Dismissed.
- Attention.

01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:30.406
Darren!

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:35.411
Hello?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.577
(shouts):
Hello?

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:41.622
Oi!

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:45.421
Darren!

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:07.689
Open the door.

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:09.866
- Hang on.
- I said, open the door!

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:12.615
I said, open the fucking door,
you horrible cunt.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:14.325
Yeah.

01:32:15.238 --> 01:32:17.912
Stay the fucking hell
out of my way you, an' all.

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:21.791
Darren?
