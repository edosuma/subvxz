WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:04.960
Comes fully equipped.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.457
I'm telling you, it's a steal at 400.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.589
- You gotta check with your husband?
- It's just me.

00:17.810 --> 00:21.394
Mommy? Can I have a quarter
for the vending machine?

00:21.480 --> 00:24.142
Honey, I said wait for me by the pool.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.981
You said, "It was just me."

00:26.944 --> 00:30.061
I meant my husband's out of the picture.
Just me and my son.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.613
I don't know.
The tenants don't like noise.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.443
- He's very quiet.
- I need two months up front.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.041
Here, honey.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.377
Hey, no running.
You hear me, Miles?

01:41.185 --> 01:44.427
Mom! Mommy! Help!

01:46.440 --> 01:48.351
Mommy!

01:49.193 --> 01:52.401
Miles? Miles, what happened?

01:52.488 --> 01:54.194
Mommy.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.741
Oh, God... Mr. Vonner.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.781
- What were you doing in here?
- He...

02:04.875 --> 02:07.491
He was all alone...
he was scared...

02:07.586 --> 02:09.247
His chest hurt.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.796
- He kept calling out for Kimberly...
- Kimberly?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.714
That's his wife.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.919
And she died last year.
How would you know that?

02:18.055 --> 02:20.967
- I heard him.
- Miles, what are you talking about?

02:22.393 --> 02:24.509
He's still talking right now!

02:25.980 --> 02:27.220
Honey...

02:28.816 --> 02:31.728
- ...he's dead.
- I told you,

02:31.819 --> 02:35.607
I can hear him! I can hear him!

02:36.824 --> 02:38.405
Miles, you there? Pick up.

02:39.744 --> 02:42.281
- Jim? Where are you?
- l'll fill you in later.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.699
- I need you to take care of something.
- What?

02:44.790 --> 02:47.452
The security tapes
from the pylon camera feeds,

02:47.585 --> 02:49.701
they need to accidentally get erased.

02:49.795 --> 02:50.875
Erased? Why?

02:50.963 --> 02:53.670
I ain't got time for questions,
Miles, just do it.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.669
OK, OK... Which ones?

02:56.469 --> 02:57.834
Look on your monitors.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.846
You see us?

03:05.394 --> 03:08.431
Yeah, you're on number 4.
Is that Kate?

03:09.106 --> 03:11.848
- What are you doing out there?
- Just erase number 4.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.230
If anyone asks, I'm off the grid
looking for the escaped hostile.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.812
- You mean your pal, Sayid?
- Damn it, Miles!

03:17.907 --> 03:21.445
- You gonna help me or not?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.820
All right. / owe you one.

03:23.913 --> 03:27.952
I want you go back, find Juliet, see if
anyone's noticed Ben's gone missing.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.499
What are you gonna do
when they find out?

03:30.628 --> 03:33.461
Do my best to cover it up.
Case you haven't noticed...

03:33.547 --> 03:35.708
...l'm head of security.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.457
All right, see you back there.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.299
Where's LaFleur?

03:46.394 --> 03:48.976
He's out looking
for the escaped prisoner.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.099
I tried to get him on his walkie, but...

03:52.316 --> 03:54.978
- ...he must be out of range.
- Damn it.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.903
All right. Then it's
gonna have to be you.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.823
Jim already knows about this, but I'm
gonna bring you in the circle of trust.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.327
- Can I trust you, Miles?
- Absolutely, Horace.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.450
OK. Good.

04:10.042 --> 04:14.661
I need you to take this out
to Radzinsky at grid 334.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.088
He's going to give you something
in return. Bring it back to me,

04:18.175 --> 04:20.507
with no questions asked.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.255
You understand?

04:26.392 --> 04:29.008
We're not supposed to be in 334.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.227
Isn't that hostile territory?

04:32.356 --> 04:34.187
Welcome to the circle of trust.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.574
Stop right there!

04:51.625 --> 04:54.617
Miles? What are you doing here?
l was expecting LaFleur.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.747
LaFleur's busy. Horace sent me instead.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.469
- I'm in the circle of trust.
- Get out!

05:10.436 --> 05:14.304
I'm supposed to give you this.
He said you had something for me.

05:35.503 --> 05:38.745
- What happened to him?
- He had an accident.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.791
- What kind of accident?
- He fell into a ditch.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.464
Is that a bullet hole in his head?

05:48.057 --> 05:49.092
The ditch had a gun?

05:49.183 --> 05:52.596
It doesn't matter what happened,
knowing that is not yourjob.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.938
Yourjob is to do what I tell you to.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.783
Take him back to Horace now, Miles.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.312
OK...

06:41.860 --> 06:43.475
...so what really happened?

07:07.428 --> 07:09.214
I need to see her.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.159
Ma?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.539
It's me.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.420
Miles?

07:50.721 --> 07:53.133
I'm sorry that...

07:53.223 --> 07:56.431
- ...I couldn't make it by sooner.
- It's OK.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.926
You're here now.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.652
Why did you come, Miles?

08:07.946 --> 08:12.280
I need you to tell me why I'm this way.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.207
Howl do the things I do.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.162
And I need to know why you won't
talk to me about my father.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.173
Because he never cared about us.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.673
Never cared about you.

08:33.764 --> 08:37.552
- I need to know where he is, Ma.
- It doesn't matter where...

08:37.643 --> 08:39.383
- It does matter.
- Please...

08:39.478 --> 08:42.140
- l have a right to know!
- He's dead!

08:46.402 --> 08:48.017
Your father...

08:49.697 --> 08:53.360
...kicked us out
when you were just a baby.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.033
He didn't want anything to do with us.

08:58.288 --> 09:02.531
So the less you knew about him,
the better.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.000
Why didn't you just tell me?

09:09.133 --> 09:11.715
Because it was over.

09:12.386 --> 09:16.720
Your dad has been dead a long time.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.894
Where's his body?

09:27.192 --> 09:29.979
Somewhere you can never go.

09:37.286 --> 09:41.029
Pierre, if it was caused by
the electromagnetism, we need to know.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.371
You want to see it now?

09:42.499 --> 09:46.117
Yeah, hejust got back.
I'll send him out with it right away.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.587
OK.

09:50.132 --> 09:53.249
- Did you bring the package?
- "Package?" You mean corpse?

09:53.343 --> 09:58.007
Yeah. Now I need you to bring it
out to Dr. Chang at the Orchid.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.846
Listen, man, I'm security.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.429
If you need somebody to drive,
can't someone from the motor pool do it?

10:07.524 --> 10:10.766
If I wanted someone from the motor pool,
I would've asked them.

10:10.861 --> 10:14.604
And since LaFleur decided
to disappear, you're all I've got.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.859
Sojust bring it out to Dr. Chang

10:16.950 --> 10:19.532
and we'll all call it a day, OK?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.917
Hey. What the hell are you doing?
That's my van.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.837
- | just signed it out.
- It doesn't matter. It's mine.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.419
- Where you going?
- The Orchid.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.466
Me, too! I made lunch for the crew.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.971
Sandwiches. You want one? Ham and
cheese. I made my secret garlic mayo.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.809
- You're waiting for the next van.
- We're going the same place.

10:48.899 --> 10:53.609
We carpool, help global warming, which
hasn't happened, we can prevent it!

10:55.197 --> 10:58.189
Wait a second. Are you on
some kind of secret mission?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.568
Just get in.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.040
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.417
We gave him to them,
to the Others.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.795
- Anyone see you?
- I don't think so.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.923
- Did James help?
- Yes.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.847
- Thank you so much for sending him.
- Of course.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.431
I got here as soon as I could.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.517
All the vans were out so I had to ru...

11:35.529 --> 11:37.360
Where's Ben?

11:39.867 --> 11:42.108
- Did he...
- No... no.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.158
- Roger...
- Where is he?

11:44.288 --> 11:46.825
I'm so sorry.
I was gone ten minutes.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.663
- I don't know.
- What?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.617
- He was dying, how can he be gone?
- I don't know...

11:51.712 --> 11:55.796
He got up and walked out? You're his
doctors. You're supposed to watch him.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.999
I know. I know. If wejust calm down...

11:58.135 --> 11:59.966
Don't tell me to calm down!

12:00.053 --> 12:03.011
- Somebody came and took my boy?
- I'm so sorry!

12:03.098 --> 12:05.464
I'm going to security!

12:12.566 --> 12:13.897
Well...

12:15.944 --> 12:17.480
...here we go.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.456
How do you spell "bounty hunter?"

12:35.547 --> 12:38.254
What are you doing?
Writing your memoirs?

12:38.342 --> 12:39.957
lt's personal.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.979
Dude, did you just, you know...

12:54.066 --> 12:58.355
- What?
- You know, it stinks. Did you...

12:58.445 --> 13:01.187
- No.
- Well, it wasn't me.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.193
So roll down your window.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.163
Something foul in here.
It's coming from back there.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.707
- Maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.
- That's not possible...

13:16.380 --> 13:18.086
OK. Maybe it is possible.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.422
- Pull over. I gotta check.
- Forget it.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.797
I gotta check. If those sandwiches
are bad, people could get sick.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.296
Look, will you pull over?!

13:50.080 --> 13:52.162
Dude. There's a body bag back here.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.784
With a body in it.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.127
Traditionally what you put
in a body bag.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.995
Well, who is he? What happened?

13:59.089 --> 14:02.252
Don't worry about it.
And don't tell anybody you saw him.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.423
Dude. What happened to him?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.169
His name's Alvarez.

14:07.264 --> 14:12.304
He was digging a hole and thinking
about some chick named Andrea.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.885
Then he felt a sharp pain
in his mouth,

14:14.980 --> 14:18.143
which turned out to be a filling
from his tooth being yanked

14:18.275 --> 14:21.984
right out of its socket
and blowing through his brain.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.103
Then he was dead.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.740
How does a filling get blown
through someone's head?

14:28.827 --> 14:30.613
Got me. Can we go now?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.696
How do you know all this?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.872
Because I know.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.245
But how do you know
what he was thinking?

14:38.336 --> 14:39.621
| just know.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.288
You can talk to dead people!

14:44.342 --> 14:46.628
Can we please just go?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.762
Don't worry, dude.
Your secret's safe with me.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.682
- You want to know why?
- No.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.306
Because I can talk to them, too.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.647
If you don't mind, Mr. Gray,

15:08.742 --> 15:11.734
can you tell me what happened to him?

15:11.828 --> 15:13.534
Last Labor Day weekend,

15:14.998 --> 15:16.989
drunk driver ran a light...

15:19.252 --> 15:20.287
That was that.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.164
Where is your son buried?

15:23.632 --> 15:27.750
We cremated him. Scattered the ashes
on the football field at school.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.505
For what I do,
it's much better if there's a body.

15:34.351 --> 15:38.219
But your ad said you could communicate
with the dead. Anytime. Anywhere.

15:38.355 --> 15:42.348
- I know what my ad says, Mr. Gray.
- Please?

15:45.028 --> 15:47.110
| just want you to ask him...

15:49.741 --> 15:51.277
Did he know that I loved him?

15:54.538 --> 15:56.119
It's gonna cost extra.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.581
Of course.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.417
Thank you.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.385
OK. Now...

16:17.394 --> 16:18.884
Please give me your hands.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.190
I want you to concentrate on
Russell. Get a picture in your head.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.360
Can you do that?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.277
Yeah... OK.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.500
Did it work?

16:49.759 --> 16:52.250
Your son says he knew
that you loved him.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.424
He always knew.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.680
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.989
Excuse me.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.940
- Miles Straume?
- Yeah?

17:15.076 --> 17:17.283
Hi. My name is Naomi Dorrit.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.447
My employer has been following
your work for some time,

17:21.541 --> 17:24.283
and is interested in retaining
your unique services.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.919
There's a restaurant
not far from here.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.338
Would you like to hear
what I have to say?

17:30.425 --> 17:32.381
Yeah, absolutely.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.752
Hey, Roger.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.135
You OK?

18:19.349 --> 18:21.214
Let me see...

18:21.309 --> 18:24.176
My son got shot.
And now he's disappeared.

18:24.271 --> 18:28.355
So... I'm pretty far from OK...

18:30.568 --> 18:32.604
You know, I'm sure...

18:33.238 --> 18:35.399
...things are gonna work out.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.031
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.873
| just have a feeling he's gonna be OK.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.211
What do you mean... "a feeling?"

18:52.299 --> 18:54.915
I'm just don't think
you should give up hope.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.265
Do you know something?

19:06.062 --> 19:09.304
- Do you know what happened to him?
- No, I don't.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.391
Wait a minute. Why are you
so interested in my kid?!

19:12.485 --> 19:15.352
I'm sorry I came over here.
l was just trying to help.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.778
You're trying to help?

19:16.906 --> 19:21.616
You wanna help, Kate? Why don't you
just mind your own business!

19:42.265 --> 19:44.130
I don't know why you won't admit it.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.724
You can trust me.
| talk to lots of dead people.

19:46.811 --> 19:50.520
So you have conversations with them?
Like they're your pals?

19:50.607 --> 19:53.440
Sure. All the time.
Sometimes we even play chess.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.819
- You actually see them?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.983
Because that's not how it works.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.533
You wouldn't know how it works
unless you can do it!

20:03.620 --> 20:07.078
What I can do has nothing to do
with chatting with ghosts, nitwit.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.248
It's a feeling. A sense.

20:10.335 --> 20:14.578
When somebody's dead, their brain stops
functioning. There's no more talking.

20:14.672 --> 20:18.756
There's just who they were,
whatever they knew before they died.

20:18.843 --> 20:22.301
- That's how it works for me.
- Great. I'm happy for you.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.381
You're just jealous my power
is better than yours.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.716
We're here.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.803
Now shut the hell up
and deliver your damn sandwiches.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.039
What's he doing here?

20:56.172 --> 20:58.879
He came to deliver lunch
to the work crew.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.710
Lunch? Your instructions
were to come alone.

21:02.846 --> 21:05.508
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone
about the body.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.433
- He knows?
- I'm sorry.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.932
He was rooting around in the back
and saw it.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.855
Dude. I can keep a secret.

21:15.942 --> 21:20.857
You'd better... Hurley. Because if you
think working in the kitchen is bad...

21:20.947 --> 21:23.689
I like the kitchen.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.365
Well, how do you feel
about polar bear feces?

21:26.453 --> 21:30.287
If you breathe a word of this,
I'll have you shipped to Hydra island.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.160
You can weigh turds
for their ridiculous experiments.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.708
Gross.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.958
You two! Bring the package inside.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.961
And you? Stay here till I get back.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.546
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.445
Dude, that guy's a total douche.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.275
That douche is my dad.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.459
You did say you were taking
me out to dinner?

22:18.546 --> 22:21.162
No. I said lwas
taking you to a restaurant.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.925
You wanna tell me
what's back here, sweetheart?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.673
Your audition.

22:31.935 --> 22:35.143
Look... whatever you've
got going on here,

22:35.230 --> 22:38.097
- this isn't really my thing.
- From what I understand,

22:38.191 --> 22:41.183
if the price is right,
this is exactly your thing.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.024
So what can you
tell me about this man?

23:09.973 --> 23:11.713
His name is Felix.

23:14.477 --> 23:19.096
He was on his way
to deliver something to a...

23:22.318 --> 23:25.355
...guy named Widmore.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.274
Deliver what?

23:30.493 --> 23:33.155
A bunch of papers. Photos.

23:33.246 --> 23:36.488
Pictures... of...

23:37.542 --> 23:39.703
...empty graves.

23:40.545 --> 23:44.788
A purchase order for an old airplane.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.346
So. Did I pass?

24:00.523 --> 24:03.014
l'm leading an expedition
to an island.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.101
On that island is a man
that will be difficult to find.

24:06.195 --> 24:09.187
- That's why I need you.
- Need me for what?

24:09.282 --> 24:14.276
This island has a number of deceased
individuals "residing" on it.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.203
As this man is responsible
for their being deceased,

24:17.290 --> 24:21.704
we believe they can supply invaluable
information as to his whereabouts.

24:22.754 --> 24:28.249
Much as hunting down a mass-murderer
sounds really safe,

24:29.052 --> 24:31.384
I'm gonna pass.
Thanks for the audition.

24:33.473 --> 24:37.261
My employer is willing to pay you
one point six million dollars.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.887
When do we leave?

24:50.990 --> 24:54.574
- So anyway...
- I don't want to talk about it.

24:54.661 --> 24:55.992
Are you kidding me?

24:56.079 --> 24:59.537
How weird is it that your dad
is the dude from all those movies?

24:59.624 --> 25:02.366
Back then he was Marvin Candle.
Is that a stage name?

25:02.460 --> 25:05.543
What part of "I don't want to talk
about it" isn't sinking in?

25:05.630 --> 25:08.793
Well, if you didn't wanna talk about it,
why'd you tell me?

25:08.925 --> 25:11.416
How long have you known
he was your dad?

25:11.761 --> 25:16.881
The third day here at the cafeteria
my mother got in line behind me.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.386
That was my first clue.

25:20.186 --> 25:24.429
But all these Dharma dudes end up dead.
Don't you want to save him?

25:24.524 --> 25:28.858
I can't save him. They're gonna
get killed no matter what I do. So...

25:28.945 --> 25:30.435
...why bother?

25:31.364 --> 25:34.777
I need you to take me to Radzinsky
at the work site immediately.

25:36.077 --> 25:40.366
- You, Hurley... You say a word...
- Polar bear poop. Got it.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.708
- What happened to the body?
- What body?

25:58.850 --> 26:01.637
This room is on my rounds.
What are you doing here?

26:01.728 --> 26:04.686
I figured I'd cover for you.

26:04.772 --> 26:08.264
- I heard what happened to your son.
- Which part?

26:08.359 --> 26:12.648
That he got shot or that somebody
kidnapped him from the infirmary?

26:13.573 --> 26:16.690
- What are you doing here at work?
- What else am I gonna do?

26:16.826 --> 26:21.195
Sit around and pray that those idiots
are gonna find my boy?

26:24.667 --> 26:26.328
So you can get out of here.

26:40.683 --> 26:44.175
You came in a couple days ago
with that woman Kate, right?

26:46.481 --> 26:48.187
- Yeah.
- You know her at all?

26:50.193 --> 26:51.478
Why?

26:51.569 --> 26:56.233
She's got some kind of weird thing
for my kid.

26:56.365 --> 27:00.404
First she shows up at the infirmary
and gave him blood...

27:01.287 --> 27:05.246
Then, when he goes missing,
she comes to me and she says,

27:05.333 --> 27:08.541
"Don't worry, he's gonna be OK."

27:10.713 --> 27:12.954
I'm gonna tell you something, man...

27:13.591 --> 27:17.083
I'm beginning to think
she's got something to do with this.

27:19.931 --> 27:22.798
I should go to Horace...

27:22.892 --> 27:24.302
...report her.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.428
What do you think?

27:31.192 --> 27:33.353
I think, Roger, that...

27:33.444 --> 27:37.107
...that you've had a hell of a day
and that has given you

27:37.198 --> 27:40.736
a very good excuse
to go out and get drunk.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.826
Maybe that's put some
crazy ideas into your head.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.451
I know that woman, Kate.

27:49.043 --> 27:52.410
She's my friend. She would
never do anything to hurt your son.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.788
Sure.

28:19.657 --> 28:22.945
I'm new here, Dr. Chang.
What is it exactly you do at the Orchid?

28:23.035 --> 28:26.368
- lt's classified.
- Really? You can't tell anyone?

28:26.455 --> 28:29.242
- Not even your wife?
- No.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.745
What about your kids?

28:31.836 --> 28:35.454
l have a three-month-old son.
So, no, I haven't told him.

28:35.548 --> 28:39.006
Three months? Wow, congrats!
What's his name?

28:39.135 --> 28:40.124
Miles.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.510
Small world.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.882
That's your name, too, right, Miles?

28:46.976 --> 28:48.216
Yeah.

28:49.812 --> 28:53.555
So, you a fan ofjazz, Dr. Chang?
You like Miles Davis?

28:53.649 --> 28:56.391
My wife is. I like country.

28:58.821 --> 29:02.905
So you two have been here
for three years? Must be pretty tight.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.705
Dr. Chang and I don't exactly
travel in the same circles.

29:11.918 --> 29:14.125
I wasn't aware there were circles.

29:14.211 --> 29:18.500
Great. We should all get together
for a beer sometime.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.582
How awesome would that be?

29:23.846 --> 29:25.211
Stop here.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.537
You don't need to wait.
I'll ride back with Radzinsky.

30:00.883 --> 30:04.216
Dude. What is this place?
And what's up with all the secrecy?

30:05.262 --> 30:06.547
Don't know. Don't care.

30:11.894 --> 30:16.604
Hey, Glenn! What's the serial
number that goes on the hatch lid?

30:18.943 --> 30:20.604
Four, eight...

30:24.532 --> 30:25.897
...fifteen. ..

30:28.995 --> 30:30.701
...sixteen...

30:33.249 --> 30:34.614
...twenty-three. ..

30:36.877 --> 30:39.539
- Hold on a minute, it's smudged.
- Forty-two.

30:39.630 --> 30:40.961
Forty-two.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.545
How the hell'd you know that?

30:44.635 --> 30:47.342
'Cause they're building our hatch.

30:47.430 --> 30:49.591
What hatch?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.386
The one that crashed our plane.

30:57.398 --> 30:58.478
Thanks.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.115
- Hey, Miles!
- Do I know you?

31:24.050 --> 31:26.883
Miles. My name's Bram.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.054
You owe me a fish taco.

31:29.138 --> 31:32.050
Sorry about that,
but your apartment's being watched,

31:32.141 --> 31:36.054
and we had to try our best to talk you
out of working for Charles Widmore.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.056
l have no idea who that is.

31:39.690 --> 31:43.353
He's the man who chartered the boat
you'll be getting on next week.

31:43.486 --> 31:46.193
And my friend? You do not
want to get on that boat.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.737
Do you know what lies
in the shadow of the statue?

31:51.827 --> 31:54.409
No, can't say that I do.

31:54.497 --> 31:57.239
Then you're not ready
to go to that island.

31:57.333 --> 32:02.077
But if you come with us, those things
you spent your life trying to find out?

32:02.171 --> 32:03.536
You'll know.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.417
You'll know who you are, Miles.

32:06.759 --> 32:09.671
Why it is you have a gift.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.754
And most of all...
you'll know about your father.

32:17.394 --> 32:19.806
I don't know where
you're getting your intel,

32:19.897 --> 32:23.856
but I stopped caring
about my father a long time ago.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.229
What I do care about is money.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.186
So, I'll tell you what,

32:29.281 --> 32:33.445
you want me to pass on going to
the island, it's gonna cost you double.

32:33.536 --> 32:37.370
- Three point two million.
- We're not paying you anything.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.830
All the money in the world

32:40.918 --> 32:43.876
isn't gonna fill that empty hole
inside you, Miles.

32:47.550 --> 32:48.756
It's sad, isn't it?

32:50.553 --> 32:51.793
Toss him!

32:57.893 --> 33:01.181
- You're playing for the wrong team.
- What team are you on?

33:01.272 --> 33:02.762
The one that's gonna win.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.078
That hatch they're building?
There's gonna be an accident.

33:19.165 --> 33:23.204
They build a computer with a button you
have to push so the world doesn't end.

33:26.297 --> 33:30.631
So, your dad... is he around?

33:30.759 --> 33:34.172
- When we came from the future?
- No.

33:35.598 --> 33:38.556
- This is kind of awesome for you.
- How is it awesome?

33:38.642 --> 33:43.011
Because you get to hang out with him
and get to know him better and stuff.

33:43.105 --> 33:46.723
Don't bother thanking me, but he
was totally down for that beer, dude.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.978
Maybe he'll let you hold baby you!

33:49.111 --> 33:51.443
Or you can change your own diaper...

33:53.782 --> 33:57.320
Listen up, because we're only
gonna have this conversation once.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.739
I don't want to hang out with my dad.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.287
I don't want to know him better...
"and stuff."

34:02.958 --> 34:05.791
Why not? Did he beat you up
when you were little?

34:05.878 --> 34:09.041
He wasn't even around
when l was little, you dimwit!

34:09.131 --> 34:13.750
I never knew him until now.
Why am I even telling you this?

34:13.844 --> 34:18.588
- You're in pain, need to let it out.
- I'm not in pain. It doesn't matter.

34:18.682 --> 34:23.301
My father is dead. He's gone.
He never cared about me.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.182
And nothing I can do
will ever change that.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.640
But he's not gone.
We just dropped him off.

34:31.528 --> 34:34.656
You want to get into my business?
Let's get into yours!

34:34.740 --> 34:36.776
- Give that back!
- We read your diary?

34:36.867 --> 34:37.902
lt's personal!

34:37.993 --> 34:41.201
See what's going on in that
piece of granite you call a head!

34:41.288 --> 34:44.530
- Give it back!
- "Exterior. Hoth.

34:44.667 --> 34:48.205
A little spy robot thingy
zips through the atmosphere

34:48.295 --> 34:51.162
and crashes into
the snowy planet below.

34:51.257 --> 34:55.967
That's when Chewbacca shows up and
blasts it away with his crossbow laser.

34:56.053 --> 34:59.136
He shakes his fury fist
in the sky in triumph.

34:59.223 --> 35:02.215
Chewbacca: . .

35:02.309 --> 35:06.518
lt's furry. Furry fist.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.846
- I need to spell-check.
- What is this?

35:14.530 --> 35:17.567
I'm writing The Empire Strikes Back.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.032
- I'm sorry, what?
- It's 1977, right?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.201
Star Wars just came out.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.577
Pretty soon George Lucas
is gonna be looking for a sequel.

35:26.709 --> 35:29.246
I've seen Empire, like, 200 times,
so I figured

35:29.378 --> 35:31.585
make life easier
and send him the script.

35:33.424 --> 35:35.130
With a couple improvements.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.296
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

35:38.387 --> 35:40.173
Oh, yeah?

35:40.264 --> 35:43.051
Well at least I'm not scared
to talk to my own dad.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.269
- James... you're back.
- Barely.

35:56.405 --> 35:57.770
Ever have one of those days

35:57.906 --> 36:01.148
you feel like the little Dutch boy
with your finger in the...

36:02.911 --> 36:07.029
Doc. Hey. What's going on?

36:08.250 --> 36:12.334
Ben's father thinks Kate had something
to do with his son going missing.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.170
Why the hell would he think that?

36:15.257 --> 36:18.124
Because she talked to him.
Tried to make him feel better.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.179
- Her heart was in the right place.
- Where was her head?

36:25.100 --> 36:29.013
I had a talk with Roger. I don't think
he's going to say anything for now.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.437
Just wanted you to know.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.479
Thank you.

36:37.738 --> 36:40.195
Yeah, well...
Thanks for filling me in, Doc.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.647
No problem.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.088
- Hey, boss.
- Hey.

36:55.172 --> 36:58.255
We got a development.
You'd better come to the office.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.503
I been running around
the jungle all day.

37:00.594 --> 37:05.008
- Whatever development you got can wait.
- I know who took the kid.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.475
Yeah? Who's that?

37:13.357 --> 37:14.563
You.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.980
I got a good explanation
for what you saw on that tape.

37:19.071 --> 37:21.528
I sure as hell hope so.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.364
- Talk to Horace yet?
- No.

37:27.454 --> 37:31.322
After three years of working together,
I'd give you the benefit of the...

37:34.044 --> 37:36.205
Get some rope.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.425
Mr. Gray? I hope you don't mind,
your gate was open.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.307
Mr. Straume. Of course, of course.
No problem.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.435
What... brings you by?

37:58.277 --> 38:00.768
Well, sir...

38:00.863 --> 38:03.445
I'm about to go
on a boat trip for awhile...

38:05.033 --> 38:06.489
...and...

38:07.870 --> 38:09.906
...I wanted to give this back to you.

38:16.712 --> 38:19.624
I lied to you, Mr. Gray.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.748
I wasn't able to talk to your son.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.512
Why are you telling me this?

38:29.600 --> 38:32.387
You could have let me go on
believing what you said.

38:33.770 --> 38:37.137
- Wouldn't have been fair to your son.
- I'm sorry?

38:41.528 --> 38:44.520
If you needed your son
to know that you loved him...

38:44.615 --> 38:47.277
...you should have told him
when he was still alive.

39:17.648 --> 39:20.435
Sorry I said you were
afraid to talk to your dad.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.141
Don't worry about it.

39:23.946 --> 39:26.437
- | used to hate my dad, too.
- Yeah?

39:26.532 --> 39:27.863
He left when l was ten.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.569
But the best thing I ever did...

39:33.664 --> 39:35.950
...was give him a second chance.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.954
We got to be the best of friends and
although I may never see him again...

39:41.171 --> 39:44.459
...I miss him.
And I know he feels the same.

39:45.467 --> 39:48.504
My dad didn't leave when l was ten,
l was a baby.

39:49.805 --> 39:51.636
I never knew him.

39:52.474 --> 39:54.510
And I don't want to.

39:54.643 --> 39:57.134
It's not happening.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.060
That was Luke's attitude, too.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.683
- What?
- ln Empire,

40:03.777 --> 40:05.768
Luke found out Vader was his father,

40:05.862 --> 40:09.320
but instead of putting away
his light saber and talking about it,

40:09.408 --> 40:11.524
he overreacted
and got his hand cutoff.

40:12.995 --> 40:15.327
I mean, they worked it out eventually,

40:15.414 --> 40:18.121
but at what cost?
Another Death Star destroyed,

40:18.208 --> 40:21.996
Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc,
and we got the Ewoks.

40:23.672 --> 40:28.257
It all could have been avoided if they
just, you know, communicated.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.669
Let's face it, the Ewoks suck, dude.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.059
I'll be right there.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.241
Miles... I need you.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.530
- You do?
- The sub's in from HQ.

41:40.624 --> 41:43.582
- I need your help bringing them in.
- Sure. New recruits?

41:43.669 --> 41:46.206
No. Scientists from Ann Arbor.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.503
Get your van and
let's get to the dock.

42:02.938 --> 42:05.805
- Hey, can I get a hand with this?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

42:15.534 --> 42:18.446
- Dan?
- Hey, Miles.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.950
Long time no see.
