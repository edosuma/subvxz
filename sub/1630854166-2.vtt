Brayden Miller on as a client.

and Jacqueline Stewart.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.579

09:38.579 --> 09:41.123
- Uh, well,
whomever you did it for, I'm grateful

09:41.123 --> 09:43.458

the local news this morning

09:43.458 --> 09:44.668
after they found Kaleesha.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.713
- Yes. And Kaleesha Moore's face
should be on the news, not his.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.256
- Well, he's the one who killed her.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.465
- And you know he killed her how?

09:50.465 --> 09:53.468
- Look, she was gonna take him down,
so he got rid of her ass.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.512
You don't think he did it?

09:55.512 --> 09:58.557

not speculation.

It's everybody's favorite,

to your show this weekend.

for the show,

it be a double date

Brayden Miller?

11:09.378 --> 11:11.129
Yeah, I heard about that case,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.464
but the police are still investigating it,

11:12.464 --> 11:14.633
so why are you bringing it up to me?

11:14.633 --> 11:15.801
- Hmm. I don't know.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.762
Maybe because
a high-profile almost billionaire

11:18.762 --> 11:21.682
is being implicated
for the murder of his former employee,

11:21.682 --> 11:24.184

who has political ambitions

11:24.184 --> 11:26.395

that the police are throwing
their entire investigation

11:36.071 --> 11:39.032
towards the narrowed hunch
that Brayden could be a possible suspect?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.367
- He's her former employer.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.411
You know how this works.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.831
Anyone she knew closely or intimately
will be questioned.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.749
- Okay, but who else
are they questioning?

11:48.292 --> 11:50.836
Kaleesha had an ex-husband.
Why is he not on the suspect list?

11:50.836 --> 11:53.046
- According to my limited knowledge,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.716
he was questioned
and he was at a work event in Pomona

11:55.716 --> 11:58.177
surrounded by 60 other people
who can vouch for him.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.637
We also have social media pictures
from his page to confirm it.

your investigation
