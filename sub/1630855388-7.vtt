WEBVTT

00:11.303 --> 00:14.223
Okay. Delete a flight plan.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.519
Turn autopilot off.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.563
Altitude to 3,000.

00:24.608 --> 00:25.526
Okay.

00:39.957 --> 00:40.791
Stay down!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.002
Who was that?

00:45.003 --> 00:47.589
Come on, tell me! Tell me! Who?

00:49.925 --> 00:51.051
I don't know.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.347
- You're sure she's not with you?
- Somebody needs to help him!

00:55.347 --> 00:56.640
- No?
- Help him!

00:57.307 --> 00:58.308
What?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.227
What?

01:00.978 --> 01:02.479
They're coming to kill you.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.112
- She shot him.
- Who?

01:10.112 --> 01:13.824
- Some random woman, she shot him dead.
- She shot who dead?

01:14.533 --> 01:15.951
Who did she shoot?

01:16.785 --> 01:17.786
We're gonna need you.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.580
What?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.914
You can't kill them all.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.958
Give me the gun.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.753
That gun is the only gun that's loaded.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.173
All right? That's what I think.
Yes? Right?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.508
What should I do?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.051
Cable tie his fucking feet together!

01:33.635 --> 01:34.595
Put it down!

01:35.095 --> 01:36.513
- Put it on the ground!
- Help me!

01:36.513 --> 01:37.848
Just put the gun down!

01:37.848 --> 01:40.976
Give it to me before they take it
off you and kill you with it.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.479
- Give me the gun!
- I can't--

01:44.479 --> 01:45.689
Give me the fucking gun!

01:46.190 --> 01:49.776
- Move! Get down!
- No!

01:49.776 --> 01:51.320
- Where are you going?
- You're blocking me.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.030
- Move out the fucking way!
- Come on.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.823
I'm tired of you fucking with me!

01:54.823 --> 01:56.366
- Come on!
- Let's go!

01:56.366 --> 01:58.368
We've got to get through the door hatch.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.494
Stop fucking with me!

02:01.496 --> 02:02.414
Move!

02:03.207 --> 02:04.583
Back. Back, back!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.752
You have got no idea
who you're dealing with.

02:07.336 --> 02:10.589
I'm not joking, mate!
Time to let someone else have a go!

02:14.218 --> 02:15.969
It's all right.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.056
I don't know who I'm dealing with?
You don't!

02:20.265 --> 02:22.976
No, mate.
This gun is the only gun that's loaded.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.186
This gun.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.395
Okay?

02:25.395 --> 02:28.857
So now you listen to me.
This hijack is over.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.942
It's over!

02:31.109 --> 02:33.612
We have a different problem.
A bigger problem.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.364
But we've got less than an hour to fix it.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.449
Got it?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.631
Yeah, I get that, Tina,
but it's not the only plane in the sky.

03:35.549 --> 03:39.636
Yeah. And when we have
that information, we'll let you know.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.889
Okay. We're confirmed on the bubble.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.975
That's a 25-mile exclusion zone
around Kingdom 2-9,

03:44.975 --> 03:46.602
the moment it enters our air space.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.228
That's seven minutes.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.689
Let's have all the London airports
keeping a runway free, please.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.275
Stansted is our preference
if they give us any choice.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.527
- Stansted already standing by.
- And Bristol?

03:55.527 --> 03:58.614
It won't have the fuel for Bristol.
Not after its Hungarian detour.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.408
Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.160
Are you still trying
every mobile on the manifest?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.369
Trying everything we can.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.538
Then if we make contact,
we're handing it over to the RAF.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.124
- Simon, this is my flight.
- It's a military situation.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.127
- It's a commercial aircraft.
- They've already scrambled jets.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.588
I'm not talking to the jets, am I?
I'm talking to the plane.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.839
Alice, I'm not gonna argue
with you about this.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.591
Thank you. I'm glad about that.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.010
Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?

04:23.430 --> 04:25.057
Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?

04:25.641 --> 04:26.892
Tell her.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.811
- Gun down. Do what I say.
- Get off him. Get back!

04:29.811 --> 04:32.272
It's over, Jay. They know it's not loaded.
It's over.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.858
Just give it here.
All right, listen to me carefully.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.485
Find the woman
that's the head of the cabin crew.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.445
Tell her to find that doctor in Economy.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.781
Go and help her colleague
that's been shot. Got it?

04:41.365 --> 04:42.574
All right, you.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.785
- Call her and tell her it's over.
- What?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.704
Tell her that the passengers
have control of this plane

04:47.704 --> 04:49.748
and if she doesn't come out there
in 60 seconds--

04:49.748 --> 04:50.749
It won't work.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.292
I told you. She's not one of us.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.379
No. She has to be, okay?
This can't happen twice in one flight.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.797
He doesn't mean it like that.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.385
He means whoever she is, we don't know.
We've not been told.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.761
"Not been told."

05:05.222 --> 05:06.557
Come here. Tie 'em up.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.143
Whatever happens, we restrain
the rest of them. Agreed? Yeah?

05:11.687 --> 05:12.688
All right. Come on.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.440
Come on!

05:16.275 --> 05:17.484
Can you open up?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.236
<i>Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?</i>

05:21.530 --> 05:23.365
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is London.
How do you read?</i>

05:23.365 --> 05:24.575
<i>Well, there was always,</i>

05:24.575 --> 05:26.952
<i>always gonna be more to this.
There had to be.</i>

05:27.536 --> 05:28.704
If you want to break two men

05:28.704 --> 05:30.831
out of prison, whoever they may be,

05:30.831 --> 05:33.125
you don't need to hijack an airliner.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.252
You just kidnap the governor. Or a guard.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.881
Now, this here is known as a "bear raid."

05:38.881 --> 05:41.842
- A what?
- A bear raid. "Bear" as in the animal.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.594
Yeah, there was a major short trade made

05:43.594 --> 05:45.179
the moment the markets opened
this morning.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.222
So, they hijack the plane

05:47.222 --> 05:49.516
then leak it to the media.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.685
Not a major outlet
that we've put under blackout

05:51.685 --> 05:54.980
but some trigger-happy financial journo
who goes straight onto Twitter,

05:54.980 --> 05:56.273
and before you know it,

05:56.273 --> 05:59.985
shares in Kingdom Airlines
are falling faster than the plane itself.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.405
But if a share price is dropping
don't you lose money?

06:03.906 --> 06:07.117
Not if you bet the other way.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.202
Exactly.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.748
Hijackings don't exactly do much
for an airline's share price.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.791
What's the best outcome for the OCG?

06:14.791 --> 06:15.834
Financially?

06:16.418 --> 06:17.628
Well, the best outcome for them

06:17.628 --> 06:19.087
is the worst outcome for the plane.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.589
A crash?

06:22.508 --> 06:24.051
The worse it is, the more they make.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.931
Marsha, hey.

06:29.765 --> 06:33.519
Listen, these guys,
they're serious operators.

06:33.519 --> 06:34.770
I need you to be careful.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.606
I need you to look after yourself
and look after Kai.

06:37.606 --> 06:38.857
Is he with you?

06:38.857 --> 06:41.777
He's gone to his dad's place.
At least, I think he has.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.154
<i>Think. Is there anything suspicious?</i>

06:44.154 --> 06:47.074
<i>Anyone call at the house?
Any strange calls or anything?</i>

06:49.034 --> 06:50.035
There was one.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.037
From who? Marsha, from who?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.497
<i>What did they want?</i>

06:55.499 --> 06:57.084
<i>Marsha, what did they want?</i>

06:57.084 --> 06:59.002
They wanted me to confirm Sam's address.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.845
What's happening?

07:22.609 --> 07:23.861
Keep him down.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.279
Tie him up. Quick.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.830
- No, it's locked.
- It can't just be locked.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.249
- That's the system.
- So, what if the pilot gets locked out?

07:37.249 --> 07:38.709
Then there's the first officer.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.169
Well, this is her bag.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.380
And there's no ID,
but she's clearly a mum,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.632
'cause there's pizzas, yogurts,
family shop.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.134
She is a mum.

07:47.134 --> 07:51.305
She is. And she told me
she wants to get back to her family.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.974
- What's her name? It was--
- Well, what seat was she in?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.560
Opposite me. 13A.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.854
- Amanda. Amanda.
- Quite sure?

07:58.854 --> 08:00.606
This is good. That's our way in.

08:20.292 --> 08:25.297
<i>Amanda, it's Sam. Look,
you don't need to speak, okay?</i>

08:25.297 --> 08:27.799
<i>You don't have to talk.
You don't have to tell us anything.</i>

08:29.218 --> 08:30.802
<i>All I ask is that you--</i>

08:30.802 --> 08:33.179
<i>Just want you to hear us out, okay?
That's all we ask.</i>

08:33.847 --> 08:35.140
<i>Can you keep this line open?</i>

08:38.268 --> 08:39.269
Amanda?

08:41.522 --> 08:42.856
Amanda?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.359
Amanda?

08:46.902 --> 08:49.029
Amanda. Amanda.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.699
Come on. Amanda.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.285
It's me, Sam.

08:57.996 --> 08:58.997
Amanda?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.543
- Look. On the map.
- Come on, please.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.469
Just talk to the police.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.222
It's been doing that
for the last five minutes.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.224
Amanda?

09:31.572 --> 09:35.284
This is now a code one situation.
Kingdom 2-9 has changed its heading.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.286
Repeat, Kingdom 2-9
has changed its heading.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.121
<i>What do you mean changed its heading?</i>

09:39.121 --> 09:42.416
- <i>Changed it to what?</i>
- Kingdom 2-9 was due to arc south

09:42.416 --> 09:43.750
- to Heathrow...
- Hello?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.086
...but is now heading directly
for Central London.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.672
And, Alice,
is that definitely intentional?

09:48.672 --> 09:51.800
It cannot be anything other
than completely intentional.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.887
- <i>Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?</i>
- I have RAF command.

09:54.887 --> 09:58.640
- They've okayed a Quick Reaction Alert.
- <i>Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?</i>

09:58.640 --> 10:00.392
That's two Typhoons airborne.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.937
- Thank you.
- <i>Kingdom 2-9, my name is Alice.</i>

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
- You'll then have five minutes...
- <i>Please identify.</i>

10:06.565 --> 10:07.858
...to give an order or not.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.069
<i>...Government unlikely at this stage</i>

10:11.069 --> 10:12.863
<i>to confirm anything publicly,</i>

10:12.863 --> 10:15.407
<i>but one would imagine
usual protocols will apply.</i>

10:16.033 --> 10:19.494
<i>Houses of Parliament, The Shard,
The London Eye.</i>

10:19.494 --> 10:21.371
<i>We're talking about a massive</i>

10:21.371 --> 10:24.208
<i>and urgent
evacuation of key sites in its path.</i>

10:25.000 --> 10:26.919
<i>Could you give us a picture
of what would be--</i>

10:34.134 --> 10:35.802
<i>That's affirmative, over.</i>

10:40.682 --> 10:41.683
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.854
- This your property, sir?
- I wish. I'm just working here.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.606
Working, as in?

10:47.606 --> 10:52.110
Cleaner. The owner,
he does short-term lets.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.613
The last lot had some sort of house party.

10:55.364 --> 10:59.785
Only we had a 999 call from a landline
registered to this apartment.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.328
This apartment or this building?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.539
This apartment. Twenty minutes ago.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.290
I don't think so, mate.

11:05.916 --> 11:06.959
I wouldn't make it up.

11:06.959 --> 11:10.295
I'm not saying you would,
but as you can see, nothing doing here.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.257
Do you wanna come in?

11:19.638 --> 11:22.933
No, we'll check some of the other flats.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.102
Probably some kind of mistake.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.271
Okay.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.611
Check this out!

11:36.280 --> 11:39.116
His son. Hiding the whole time.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.244
You'll never guess what, mate.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.538
Daddy's on the telly.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.214
Look.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.966
- I'm looking.
- No, there. Look.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.346
Oh, my God.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.238
<i>There are 200 people on that plane.</i>

12:18.238 --> 12:21.575
If it strikes Central London,
it would kill twice that again.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.951
You can't say that.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.078
The choice is simple.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.291
- There is no choice.
- Either we let it go, or we stop it.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.544
We shoot it down while it's over water.
But not over the capital.

12:32.544 --> 12:36.548
- The Prime Minister decides.
- No, she acts on advice.

12:37.049 --> 12:40.219
She will make the statement,
but let's be clear,

12:40.219 --> 12:42.763
the decision is ours.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.062
Our phones. Where are they?

12:50.729 --> 12:52.189
Everyone needs their phones back.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.149
She's right.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.109
- Needs to phone home.
- She's right.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.194
No, she's not.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.321
- Where are they?
- She's wrong.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.240
- You f-- Where are they?
- Hey, hey!

13:01.240 --> 13:02.824
- It's okay. Stop that.
- Tell her!

13:03.867 --> 13:05.536
Tell her what? Why? Why no phones?

13:06.203 --> 13:08.372
'Cause they'll all tell the ground
what's happening.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.459
They'll know that we don't know
who's flying the plane.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.754
When they hear that,
they'll shoot us down.

13:16.839 --> 13:17.840
Right?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.724
Due to the deviation over Hungary,

13:27.724 --> 13:30.435
Kingdom 2-9's fuel levels
are dangerously low.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.312
An endurance...

13:32.312 --> 13:35.649
This is Flight Path Control.
Is that Kacey Turner?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.821
Kingdom 2-9, once again, how do you--

13:49.746 --> 13:52.040
This is Alice Sinclair.
Who am I speaking to, please?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.334
It's Sam. Sam Nelson.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.714
Sam. I'm an air traffic controller
assigned to your flight.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.966
I'm aware of your situation,
and I want to help you.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.050
<i>Okay.</i>

14:02.050 --> 14:03.552
I need to speak to the captain.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.389
The captain is unavailable.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.640
- <i>Unavailable?</i>
- No.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.894
There was an incident.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.103
<i>He got injured.</i>

14:13.729 --> 14:16.148
Then I need to speak to
whoever is flying the plane.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.109
The other pilot...

14:19.693 --> 14:21.445
- First officer.
- The first officer...

14:21.945 --> 14:23.197
<i>Is she flying the plane?</i>

14:25.157 --> 14:26.158
Yes.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.370
Okay, Sam. Listen to me.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.124
If me and you are gonna get along,
I need the truth.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.709
All right.

14:38.545 --> 14:42.591
<i>One more time.
Is the first officer flying the plane?</i>

14:47.012 --> 14:48.013
<i>Sam?</i>

14:48.847 --> 14:49.848
No.

14:49.848 --> 14:50.933
No?

14:50.933 --> 14:54.144
<i>No, because you have eyes on the plane.</i>

14:54.144 --> 14:55.979
<i>You're gonna see it for yourselves.</i>

14:55.979 --> 14:57.606
Alice. Come on, give me the phone.

14:57.606 --> 15:00.526
<i>The woman at the controls
is not the first officer.</i>

15:00.526 --> 15:01.693
Good. So, who is she?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.240
Her name is Amanda.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.369
She's a passenger, a mum.
That's all we know about her.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.580
<i>But why is she flying the plane?</i>

15:19.086 --> 15:20.170
<i>Sam, listen to me.</i>

15:21.380 --> 15:24.424
No one wants those jets to do anything
but leave you well alone.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.553
But in order for that to happen,
you're gonna need to talk to me.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.977
Yours are not the only lives
in danger here, Sam.

15:38.438 --> 15:43.235
Yeah. Well, she killed the pilot.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.321
Locked herself in the cockpit
and we can't get in.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.951
We cannot stop this plane.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.507
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is Trojan formation.</i>

16:07.134 --> 16:09.595
<i>I have been authorized
by His Majesty's government</i>

16:09.595 --> 16:12.055
<i>to take lethal action
if you do not respond.</i>

16:13.765 --> 16:16.143
<i>Kingdom 2-9, please acknowledge.</i>

16:19.605 --> 16:21.398
- We shoot it down.
- We can't.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.568
The best outcome for them,

16:25.068 --> 16:27.070
is the worst outcome for the plane.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.575
We cannot stand by
and watch it crash into the capital.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.660
I cannot be part of that decision.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.495
No? Well then, let it be mine.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.625
I'm Home Secretary. It's over London.
It can come from me.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.463
- We need you back in.
- I've had my turn.

16:46.215 --> 16:51.637
I've also just let two of the most wanted
men in the country drive out of prison.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.974
So I am damaged goods as it is.

16:58.227 --> 17:00.062
I mean it. If I'm wrong...

17:02.064 --> 17:03.106
I'll take the hit.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.097
<i>Control, this is Trojan.</i>

17:36.056 --> 17:40.018
<i>Moving into position.
Awaiting your command.</i>

17:43.438 --> 17:46.775
<i>Plane is still hijacked.
It's still heading for Central London.</i>

17:46.775 --> 17:48.569
<i>Passengers have no way
of stopping the plane.</i>

17:48.569 --> 17:50.237
RAF Command need your call.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.239
You have the PM holding.

17:52.990 --> 17:53.991
Right now.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.043
Prime Minister.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.379
No.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.381
We stay clear.

18:10.048 --> 18:15.220
We evacuate key sites. But we do not,
cannot act against our own people.

18:16.305 --> 18:17.306
If that--

18:19.141 --> 18:22.144
If this is wrong, or weak,
then this is on me.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.023
But that is the advice
you are being given.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.788
Thank you. Understood.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.213
That is a negative. Repeat,
that is a negative. Do not engage.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.715
You heard her. Get your jets to back off.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.094
<i>Trojan, this is strike command.
Pull back and maintain visual.</i>

18:56.803 --> 19:00.224
<i>Copy that. Maintaining visual.</i>

19:08.232 --> 19:09.983
<i>Sam, are you there? Can you hear me?</i>

19:10.526 --> 19:13.195
<i>Sam? The jets will not engage.</i>

19:14.112 --> 19:15.948
<i>Sam, can you hear me? Are you there?</i>

19:16.657 --> 19:18.075
<i>The jets will not engage.</i>

19:18.742 --> 19:20.327
<i>Sam, can you hear me, please?</i>

19:20.327 --> 19:23.288
- <i>The jets will not fire.</i>
- Yes. I can hear you.

19:23.288 --> 19:26.750
- Good. Sam, are you near the cockpit?
- <i>Why?</i>

19:27.876 --> 19:29.670
Because we've still gotta land this plane.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.935
Come. Come on. Let's go. Come on.
We're meeting the helicopter in an hour.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.855
With every penny the shares drop,
we make another 18 million.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.147
Jesus. How much do you need?

19:49.147 --> 19:52.568
Look, it's dropping three points a minute.
How much do you wanna turn down?

19:52.568 --> 19:55.696
- No, she needs an answer.
- And we need to make some money.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.739
We're not here just to pay people off.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.909
Don't go soft on me now.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.081
<i>For those of you just joining us,</i>

20:06.081 --> 20:08.750
<i>we are continuing in our coverage
of the KA29 story.</i>

20:09.251 --> 20:11.753
<i>Now with detrimental effects
upon the markets,</i>

20:11.753 --> 20:13.213
<i>with drops in share prices</i>

20:13.213 --> 20:14.756
<i>across the travel industry.</i>

20:15.257 --> 20:17.176
<i>Kingdom Airlines themselves, of course,</i>

20:17.176 --> 20:19.011
<i>and other associated stocks.</i>

20:19.636 --> 20:23.056
<i>It's unclear at the moment how long
these stocks will continue to fall,</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:24.349
<i>but it's concerning--</i>

20:37.237 --> 20:38.488
Detective Daniel?

20:46.747 --> 20:47.748
Kai?

20:49.583 --> 20:50.751
Are you okay, Kai?

20:53.212 --> 20:56.423
Listen, if you can hear me,
there's some serious stuff going on.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.675
<i>But I'm on my way over there.</i>

20:59.259 --> 21:01.386
<i>You're at your dad's, yeah?
I'm coming over now. Okay?</i>

21:01.386 --> 21:02.471
No.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.432
<i>Kai, your mother wants me
to come over there now.</i>

21:05.432 --> 21:08.143
No. Please. I'm okay.

21:09.686 --> 21:10.812
I'm coming home anyway.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.691
I'm gonna get on my bike.
The one I was on this morning.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.443
You--

21:16.443 --> 21:18.862
<i>The bike that I was on this morning.</i>

21:18.862 --> 21:21.490
And I'm gonna ride as fast as I can,
and I'm coming back home.

21:23.075 --> 21:26.203
<i>Okay, mate. You ride sensibly.</i>

21:26.870 --> 21:29.248
<i>Make sure no one pulls you over. Okay?</i>

21:31.375 --> 21:32.292
Fuck me.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.721
<i>Take one. Turn it on.</i>

21:46.223 --> 21:50.394
If you can work out who it belongs to,
then try and get it back to that person.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.485
Pass it on.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.877
I can't see mine. Mine's got a blue case.

22:14.877 --> 22:18.088
- Okay. All right.
- Try that one.

22:21.258 --> 22:22.968
So, if we can't be shot down,

22:22.968 --> 22:25.137
then we're handing
the passengers back their phones.

22:25.137 --> 22:27.514
Sam, the priority is the cockpit.

22:27.514 --> 22:31.727
Kingdom 2-9 now too far north
for Heathrow. No obvious airport in sight.

22:31.727 --> 22:34.021
- Sam, the cockpit.
- Look, I can understand--

22:35.314 --> 22:37.274
- <i>Sam?</i>
- She'll never talk to you.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.109
- <i>Sam, you there? Can you--</i>
- She'll never say anything.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.570
- She's been told. They'll have her family.
- Hang on, Alice.

22:41.570 --> 22:44.448
They'll be holding them hostage,
so she does exactly what they say.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.407
How do you know that?

22:45.407 --> 22:49.661
Because they've got my family too.
They wanted the guns brought on board,

22:49.661 --> 22:52.748
and I had to do it or
they'd shoot my partner.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.458
They've got my partner right now.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.709
Why you?

22:55.709 --> 22:57.503
- Sorry?
- Are you with them?

22:57.503 --> 22:59.505
- No. No!
- Come in here.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.964
- No!
- Just stand there.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.925
- Are you with her? No?
- No.

23:02.925 --> 23:04.301
So then why you?

23:04.301 --> 23:08.931
Because he's clean. If he gets caught,
we just move on to the next guy.

23:10.349 --> 23:11.600
Why you? Who picked you?

23:12.684 --> 23:14.061
Who the fuck are you?

23:14.770 --> 23:16.021
I'm a trader.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.606
I'm the one that did the deal.

23:18.649 --> 23:19.650
What deal?

23:20.651 --> 23:21.652
What's he talking about?

23:23.362 --> 23:24.404
What deal?

23:26.031 --> 23:28.575
She needs an answer,
and we need to leave. So we close it.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.826
Not yet.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.704
No. Now. They'll be here soon.
This place is gonna be fucking crawling.

23:32.704 --> 23:34.873
- Wait.
- Just give me the phone, will you--

23:34.873 --> 23:36.500
You fucking fuck off!

23:37.000 --> 23:40.003
We lie low, until the plane crashes.
End of conversation.

23:50.305 --> 23:53.851
Change of plan. We do this early.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.043
- <i>Devlin.</i>
- Make the trade.

24:34.308 --> 24:38.187
They make their money, and it's over.
It's just about money.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.314
- And then they kill us?
- No.

24:41.023 --> 24:43.233
What, they crash the plane
just to get rich? What?

24:43.233 --> 24:45.527
That's the thing.
It should be over by now.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.156
As soon as we're over London,
it's meant to be finished.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.867
That's what I don't understand.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.821
Call me back, Mum. Please.

25:38.372 --> 25:39.373
Go on.

25:40.249 --> 25:41.542
I don't have anyone, okay?

25:42.584 --> 25:43.585
What?

25:44.253 --> 25:45.629
I don't have anybody to call.

25:48.507 --> 25:52.553
Call Mum. Oh, Mum.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.681
Hey. I'll sit here, eh?

25:57.015 --> 25:59.393
Hands up if you've got
some coloring-in stuff in here.

25:59.393 --> 26:01.812
- Yeah, you both have, haven't you, hon?
- Yeah?

26:01.812 --> 26:03.939
That'll keep us occupied, won't it?

26:05.524 --> 26:06.859
Alia?

26:06.859 --> 26:08.902
Daddy and I love you so much.

26:10.571 --> 26:11.655
We are proud of you.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.617
We are proud
of what you do with your life.

26:34.428 --> 26:35.888
Guys, you've got to see this.

26:39.141 --> 26:43.896
"Happy birthday Elodie."
Her daughter. Of course.

26:44.730 --> 26:47.149
- <i>Sam, the cockpit. Sam?</i>
- I'll call you back.

26:47.149 --> 26:48.483
No, no. Sam, please don't--

26:54.031 --> 26:55.199
Give me that.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.118
Amanda, we know about Elodie.
We've got your phone.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.458
He said he'd call me back.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.802
Anyone come into Flat 30?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.346
- Flat 30?
- Sam Nelson's flat.

27:17.346 --> 27:18.972
You seen anyone walk in there? Anyone?

27:18.972 --> 27:22.100
- A kid.
- A youth. Eighteen. Sam's boy?

27:22.976 --> 27:24.228
And some cleaners. Two of them.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.698
- Hey.
- <i>Sam Nelson.</i>

27:36.698 --> 27:39.201
He's your partner's ex.
That's how this whole thing started.

27:40.035 --> 27:42.287
He's the only person in touch
with the ground.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.872
He just hung up on Air Traffic Control.

27:43.872 --> 27:44.831
He's not involved.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.375
<i>The trust needs to work both ways.</i>

27:46.375 --> 27:47.751
He's not involved.

27:47.751 --> 27:48.836
Based on?

27:49.711 --> 27:52.297
<i>Based on the fact that
the OCG have got Sam's boy up there.</i>

27:52.297 --> 27:54.550
Zahra, I need backup at Sam's flat, now.

27:55.384 --> 27:56.385
- What's your name?
- Kenny.

27:56.385 --> 27:57.594
Kenny, come with me.

27:59.805 --> 28:03.225
Marsha? I'm here. Stay away, okay?
I'll call you back.

28:09.022 --> 28:12.860
Amanda? Amanda! Hey.

28:14.528 --> 28:15.362
Move out of my way!

28:15.362 --> 28:17.281
Stop. Please, go back to your seats.

28:17.281 --> 28:19.324
It doesn't make sense,
everybody being in here.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.951
I tried to stop them.

28:20.951 --> 28:22.995
- We're kicking it down.
- Yeah, too right.

28:22.995 --> 28:27.207
We smash it down. All of us. Even him.
We've got no fucking choice now.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.917
- He's right.
- Eddie, come on. Get them out.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.085
Right, where we going?

28:30.085 --> 28:32.629
- Just get these here.
- I'm gonna have to move your hands.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.299
- He doesn't need to be untied.
- Open up!

28:36.049 --> 28:38.218
- Move out the way!
- It's not gonna work!

28:44.600 --> 28:47.102
- Move out the fucking way!
- Fuck.

28:50.439 --> 28:53.817
Passenger flying plane is confirmed
as an Amanda Taunton.

28:53.817 --> 28:56.320
Aviation Consultant.
Used to be in the Navy.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.322
<i>Altitude's still dropping.</i>

28:58.322 --> 29:00.699
<i>Kingdom 2-9 is set
to reach unmaintainable height</i>

29:00.699 --> 29:03.493
<i>over West London. Paddington, Kilburn.</i>

29:04.077 --> 29:05.078
Crashing?

29:05.078 --> 29:07.789
If "unmaintainable height" means crashing,
just say crashing.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.083
- Crashing.
- <i>But when though?</i>

29:11.293 --> 29:12.419
Four minutes.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.254
But if it's intentional,
it could be any second.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.065
Help! We need help in here.

29:33.065 --> 29:35.067
- Keep them out the way. That's it.
- It doesn't make sense.

29:35.067 --> 29:36.735
- It's not gonna work.
- Move out--

29:43.492 --> 29:44.660
- Move!
- Stop it.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.454
- No. It's steel.
- Calm down, please. Just wait. Just--

29:49.873 --> 29:51.124
Wait, wait.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.545
Do you think it's her?

29:59.800 --> 30:00.801
Hello?

30:02.094 --> 30:05.347
<i>Sam, I killed a man.</i>

30:06.890 --> 30:09.309
- Listen, it wasn't your fault--
- <i>But I shot him.</i>

30:09.309 --> 30:11.937
And he was a dad.
He was a man with a family.

30:11.937 --> 30:14.481
<i>Amanda,
they've got your family. All right?</i>

30:14.481 --> 30:15.983
They've got your family.

30:16.817 --> 30:18.318
Isn't that right? Yeah?

30:18.318 --> 30:21.196
You do exactly what they say,
or they kill Elodie.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.658
<i>I'm right, aren't I? Amanda?</i>

30:24.658 --> 30:25.576
Yeah.

30:28.537 --> 30:29.538
And this?

30:30.289 --> 30:33.250
What I'm doing right now?
This is what I do for a living. All right?

30:33.250 --> 30:35.878
I do this in business. I close deals.

30:35.878 --> 30:39.590
I get people to do exactly
what I want them to do.

30:39.590 --> 30:41.049
I find ways

30:41.967 --> 30:44.595
<i>to make them change their minds.</i>

30:44.595 --> 30:47.306
All right? But I can't do that here.
Do you know why?

30:48.599 --> 30:53.854
Because if my kid was in danger,
I would not open this door.

30:54.605 --> 30:59.735
If my family was in danger,
I wouldn't open the door either, okay?

30:59.735 --> 31:02.613
But these people out here,
they need to know something.

31:02.613 --> 31:06.700
They need to know what's happening,
so they can speak to their families.

31:07.284 --> 31:10.662
<i>Hear their voices. Say goodbye.</i>

31:14.708 --> 31:17.836
Amanda we know about the deal.

31:19.546 --> 31:20.797
Yeah? The deal?

31:21.465 --> 31:23.675
So they get the deal, then what?

31:26.470 --> 31:30.265
Amanda, they get their money,
and then what happens?

31:36.313 --> 31:37.648
They send a message.

31:39.441 --> 31:42.611
And they say that they've done it.
That the deal is done.

31:43.362 --> 31:46.114
<i>And then once I get the message,
that's when I land.</i>

31:47.324 --> 31:48.408
- So we do land?
- Yes!

31:48.408 --> 31:50.327
<i>Only if I get that message.</i>

31:51.453 --> 31:52.955
And if you don't get the message?

31:58.544 --> 32:01.630
<i>If the message doesn't come through,
what happens next, Amanda?</i>

32:03.006 --> 32:04.091
Then I crash it.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.262
I fly into the middle of London.

32:09.847 --> 32:12.015
Otherwise, they kill Elodie,
and they kill Tom,

32:12.015 --> 32:14.017
and I'm sorry, I won't let that happen.

32:16.895 --> 32:19.898
<i>But one would imagine
usual protocols will be in place.</i>

32:19.898 --> 32:23.402
<i>Houses of Parliament, the Shard,
The London Eye.</i>

32:23.402 --> 32:25.237
<i>We're talking about</i>

32:25.237 --> 32:27.656
<i>a massive and urgent evacuation</i>

32:27.656 --> 32:29.449
<i>of key sites in its path--</i>

32:29.449 --> 32:31.201
- Think of something. It's your job.
- Hey--

32:31.702 --> 32:33.287
Battering down!

32:33.287 --> 32:34.913
Amanda, that noise,

32:35.497 --> 32:37.833
there are these people out here
and they're trying to get in,

32:37.833 --> 32:40.544
but we can stop that.
You and me. Right now. Okay?

32:40.544 --> 32:43.463
I'm sitting right opposite one
of the main hijackers,

32:43.463 --> 32:46.049
and he's told me something.
And it's something I need to tell you.

32:46.049 --> 32:48.510
I don't want to,
but I feel like I have to, okay?

32:48.510 --> 32:50.179
<i>It's something about Elodie.</i>

32:51.138 --> 32:54.766
Amanda, he's told me that
whatever happens,

32:55.642 --> 32:58.061
they're gonna kill her anyway.

32:58.061 --> 33:00.898
Okay? That's who these people are,
and that's what they're gonna do.

33:00.898 --> 33:03.066
<i>Amanda, listen to me, okay?</i>

33:03.066 --> 33:07.196
<i>They will make sure she is not a witness.</i>

33:07.196 --> 33:10.115
<i>All right? Whatever you do,
whether you crash this plane or not,</i>

33:10.115 --> 33:12.492
that is what is gonna happen, okay?

33:12.492 --> 33:14.411
So, I can get these people out of here.

33:14.411 --> 33:18.999
You can land this plane.
We can do this, okay? All right?

33:18.999 --> 33:20.459
<i>And you,</i>

33:20.459 --> 33:23.003
<i>you will save everyone else.</i>

33:23.629 --> 33:26.757
<i>They said the air travel industry...</i>

33:26.757 --> 33:28.050
Face the fucking front.

33:41.313 --> 33:43.649
<i>Terrain ahead! Pull up!</i>

33:44.608 --> 33:47.736
<i>Terrain ahead! Pull up!</i>

33:54.034 --> 33:57.371
- <i>Sink rate. Pull up!</i>
- <i>Please, Amanda.</i>

33:58.956 --> 33:59.957
<i>Come on.</i>

34:01.166 --> 34:03.627
- <i>Pull up!</i>
- <i>Come on, Amanda. Please. Come on.</i>

34:05.921 --> 34:09.507
- <i>Sink rate.</i>
- Okay, Sam. But just you. Okay?

34:09.507 --> 34:12.135
<i>Only you because otherwise
they're gonna kill me.</i>

34:12.636 --> 34:13.469
Back up.

34:13.469 --> 34:16.223
- Back up now! Back up!
- Easy, easy.

34:17.599 --> 34:20.561
It's me or no one. Okay?
That's what she's saying.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.230
Come on, open the door.

34:23.230 --> 34:26.275
Don't. Don't fucking dare! Wait!

34:36.618 --> 34:38.245
Quick as you can, mate. It's real.

34:38.245 --> 34:40.664
Keep moving. Fire escape's at the end.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.168
All of you.

34:44.168 --> 34:45.793
I'm the only one here, mate.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.213
Well, Kenny's just told me there's
a crew of cleaners in here.

34:49.089 --> 34:51.257
Come on, guys, this is not a drill!
Keep moving!

34:52.801 --> 34:54.761
Come on, mate.
There's an evacuation going on.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.513
All high-rise buildings in West London.

34:56.513 --> 34:59.641
Some kind of incident involving a plane
or something. That's all I know.

35:00.184 --> 35:01.185
We need to go down.

35:06.899 --> 35:10.819
Armed police! Armed police! Get down!

35:10.819 --> 35:12.029
Get the fuck down!

35:12.029 --> 35:13.864
Hands where I can see 'em!

35:13.864 --> 35:15.616
Show me your fucking hands.

35:15.616 --> 35:17.284
Keep them where they are.

35:17.284 --> 35:18.619
You all right?

35:18.619 --> 35:20.704
Yeah. Yeah.

35:20.704 --> 35:22.789
- Good lad.
- Target secured.

35:34.801 --> 35:36.595
- Sam?
- <i>I'm in the cockpit.</i>

35:36.595 --> 35:38.514
We have access to the cockpit.

35:38.514 --> 35:40.182
<i>We wanna land this plane.</i>

35:40.182 --> 35:42.142
<i>Sam, I'm gonna put you on speaker.</i>

35:42.142 --> 35:43.769
Yes. I'm doing the same.

35:43.769 --> 35:47.105
That's gonna help us help you.
But mine will be the only voice you hear.

35:48.065 --> 35:52.486
You are my plane on my flight sheet,
and I'm gonna land you.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.614
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Yeah. Sounds good.

36:01.745 --> 36:04.706
Sam, I need your fuel level.

36:05.374 --> 36:06.750
- Fuel level. It's--
- It's there.

36:06.750 --> 36:09.586
It's low. It's in the red.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.004
<i>How far in the red?</i>

36:11.004 --> 36:13.966
- Flaming out. It's flaming out.
- It's-- She said it's flaming out.

36:13.966 --> 36:15.634
- <i>We're flaming out.</i>
- <i>We're flaming out.</i>

36:15.634 --> 36:17.261
You're flaming out?
You've burnt all your fuel?

36:17.261 --> 36:18.512
Yeah. We burned the fuel.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.013
- <i>Sam, I need your exact heading...</i>
- Right.

36:20.013 --> 36:21.765
- <i>...your exact altitude.</i>
- We've got no fuel.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.350
I don't know what she's talking about.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.060
- Do you understand? Exact heading.
- <i>Can she hear me?</i>

36:25.060 --> 36:26.895
- <i>Can you hear me, Sam?</i>
- What code-- What does that mean?

36:26.895 --> 36:28.647
- Look at me. Okay.
- I can't do it.

36:28.647 --> 36:30.023
<i>Can she hear me?</i>

36:30.023 --> 36:31.483
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

36:32.943 --> 36:35.279
Listen to me. Alice, do me a favor,
listen to me, okay?

36:35.279 --> 36:39.032
Amanda, she shot and killed the pilot.
Not because she wanted to,

36:39.032 --> 36:41.535
but because they're holding her family,
all right?

36:41.535 --> 36:42.911
<i>They're holding her daughter,</i>

36:42.911 --> 36:44.788
<i>and she needs some assurances</i>

36:44.788 --> 36:47.291
<i>that she's not gonna go to jail
as soon as we land.</i>

36:47.291 --> 36:49.751
- <i>Can you help with that?</i>
- I can't do that. We don't have time to--

36:49.751 --> 36:50.878
<i>No. Excuse me. Listen to me.</i>

36:50.878 --> 36:53.088
I need you to tell me
that there's someone there,

36:53.088 --> 36:55.966
<i>that is listening, that can offer
some assurances to the pilot.</i>

36:55.966 --> 36:57.050
<i>Right now. Please.</i>

36:57.050 --> 36:59.595
Sam, if what you're saying is true then--

36:59.595 --> 37:01.680
then Amanda will face no charges.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.809
- Who is that? Sorry, who is it?
- <i>I'm Neil Walsh, Home Secretary.</i>

37:06.310 --> 37:09.980
<i>I repeat, no charges.
You have my word for that.</i>

37:09.980 --> 37:12.733
<i>That is a resigning matter.</i>

37:12.733 --> 37:13.817
- You hear that, yeah?
- Okay.

37:14.401 --> 37:15.944
So, now you can bring this home.

37:15.944 --> 37:18.155
All right? Okay?

37:19.406 --> 37:20.365
Okay.

37:21.825 --> 37:27.039
Okay, London,
we are on a heading of 315 degrees,

37:27.039 --> 37:31.627
<i>and an altitude of 1,500 feet.
We are too low.</i>

37:32.920 --> 37:34.963
- <i>Everybody in your seats.</i>
- Okay, kids.

37:34.963 --> 37:36.798
- <i>Seat belts on.</i>
- Make sure that we're all safe.

37:36.798 --> 37:38.675
<i>Please, everybody, back in your seats...</i>

37:38.675 --> 37:41.178
- Still not going inside.
- <i>...putting your seat belts on.</i>

37:42.012 --> 37:43.430
We're preparing to break--

37:47.392 --> 37:48.310
What's going on?

37:49.895 --> 37:51.188
- We've lost power.
- We've--

37:51.188 --> 37:53.732
We've lost power!

37:54.608 --> 37:57.110
Turn on the APU and ram air turbine.

37:57.694 --> 38:00.239
<i>You're gonna need to glide, Amanda.
That's all you can do.</i>

38:01.949 --> 38:04.743
- Fuck. APU.
- All right. Can you do that?

38:09.706 --> 38:12.960
Seat belts, on!
Everybody back in their seats!

38:12.960 --> 38:16.255
RAF Northolt available.
6.9 nautical miles.

38:16.255 --> 38:18.715
They can have units ready.
Fire, police and ambulance.

38:18.715 --> 38:22.219
<i>RAF Northolt is available in 6.9 miles.</i>

38:22.219 --> 38:23.512
But what about a motorway?

38:23.512 --> 38:25.681
- <i>Forget the motorway.</i>
- No, I can see a motorway.

38:25.681 --> 38:27.558
<i>Stop talking about the motorways,
Amanda. Please.</i>

38:27.558 --> 38:32.980
The target is Northolt,
bearing 285, bearing 285 degrees.

38:32.980 --> 38:33.897
Do you copy?

38:33.897 --> 38:35.774
Everybody back in their seats.

38:36.984 --> 38:41.154
For Christ's sake, Philip.
You're not in fancy dress.

38:41.154 --> 38:42.906
This is what you're here for!

38:49.037 --> 38:51.707
Quiet!

38:54.585 --> 38:59.131
We've held this together
for seven hours. Let's stick together now.

39:05.387 --> 39:09.892
Kingdom 2-9, Northolt is ready.
That's a 5,000-foot runway.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.060
- <i>That is not enough.</i>
- It's all they have.

39:12.644 --> 39:15.564
- We haven't got reverse thrust.
- <i>You're gonna need to turn--</i>

39:15.564 --> 39:16.982
Did you hear what I said?

39:16.982 --> 39:19.484
<i>Drop the landing gear as late as you can,</i>

39:19.484 --> 39:21.737
<i>or you won't make the runway.</i>

39:21.737 --> 39:24.865
- Okay, I've got a visual.
- <i>You've got one shot at this, Amanda.</i>

39:24.865 --> 39:28.035
I'm gonna need you to hold on
'cause I'm gonna bank left, okay?

39:28.035 --> 39:33.415
Three, two, one.

39:33.415 --> 39:35.459
- Hold on!
- Shit.

39:36.376 --> 39:37.294
<i>Banking.</i>

39:40.047 --> 39:42.758
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Hold on. A bit more.</i>

39:47.429 --> 39:48.263
Shit.

39:49.306 --> 39:51.475
<i>Banking. Pull up.</i>

39:51.475 --> 39:53.477
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.692
- We're gonna make it.
- Okay, we're on finals!

40:01.276 --> 40:02.569
Brace for impact!

40:02.569 --> 40:04.655
Brace position, hands behind your head.

40:04.655 --> 40:06.240
Make sure that your legs are down.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.408
- We're gonna go down, okay?
- Yeah, that's correct.

40:08.408 --> 40:11.119
- <i>Terrain ahead. Too low.</i>
- If this doesn't work, yeah,

40:11.119 --> 40:15.457
<i>tell Marsha she was right.
I shouldn't have got on the plane.</i>

40:17.668 --> 40:19.545
Okay, Sam I need you
to do something for me now.

40:19.545 --> 40:21.505
I need you to lower
the landing gear, okay?

40:21.505 --> 40:24.591
Pull the lever up
and turn it clockwise all the way.

40:24.591 --> 40:25.676
Do it now.

40:30.931 --> 40:32.516
When we hit the ground,

40:32.516 --> 40:35.018
I need you to press your feet
onto the pedals

40:35.018 --> 40:38.063
- as hard as you can, okay?
- Fuck. You got this, yeah.

40:42.985 --> 40:46.655
- Head down, feet back! Brace!
- Head down, feet back! Brace!

40:46.655 --> 40:48.156
It's okay.

40:48.156 --> 40:51.326
Just try not to panic, darling.
We're here. We're all together, okay?

40:51.326 --> 40:54.538
<i>Pull up.</i>

41:11.805 --> 41:13.432
Now!

41:33.076 --> 41:34.077
Sam?

42:15.577 --> 42:16.411
<i>Sam?</i>

42:17.079 --> 42:20.332
We're down.
We made it. We're on the ground.

42:21.667 --> 42:23.794
We did it.

42:30.384 --> 42:31.468
Okay.

42:32.302 --> 42:35.889
Well done, everyone.
But we still have a lot of work to do.

42:35.889 --> 42:38.684
Let's get back to those screens.
Come on. Move it.

42:38.684 --> 42:40.269
Great. Okay. Where can I help?

42:48.610 --> 42:50.070
Move! Move! Move!

43:24.605 --> 43:27.608
Armed police! Hands where I can see them!

43:27.608 --> 43:29.526
Hands where I can see them!

43:32.988 --> 43:37.367
Everybody off the plane! Remain calm.

43:37.367 --> 43:39.828
Everybody off the plane.

43:41.496 --> 43:43.957
Leave your belongings behind!

43:48.879 --> 43:51.798
- Amanda, I've got your phone.
- Thank you.

43:51.798 --> 43:53.592
You take her to the police.

43:53.592 --> 43:56.637
She's not getting arrested.
She's gotta go and see about her daughter.

43:56.637 --> 43:58.013
Sam, thank you.

44:02.935 --> 44:05.312
Have we got everyone? Fred--

44:05.312 --> 44:07.147
She said not to bring that.

44:07.147 --> 44:09.483
She wasn't talking about families.

44:09.483 --> 44:11.318
She meant for other people.

44:12.152 --> 44:13.612
Right, mind the stairs then.

44:15.697 --> 44:17.074
I'm not wearing them!

44:17.074 --> 44:18.992
I'm not armed. I'm not armed. I'm not.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.120
He's one of them!

44:22.120 --> 44:25.916
Get him, now! Fucking move!
Get over there!

44:25.916 --> 44:28.502
- Get on the ground!
- Elodie, darling, it's Mum.

44:29.253 --> 44:32.464
Yeah. Hi, darling.
Yeah, it's okay. I'm coming home.

44:47.688 --> 44:49.731
Here. They gave me your phone.

44:51.859 --> 44:52.818
You all right?

44:53.610 --> 44:54.862
- Yeah. I think so.
- Yeah?

44:57.364 --> 44:58.365
What about you?

44:59.449 --> 45:01.451
Well, I'm better than I was
five minutes ago.

45:27.936 --> 45:31.231
It's down. They've landed.
Getting people off the plane now.

45:33.317 --> 45:35.694
Thank you. I mean it.

45:42.284 --> 45:46.622
While all of that was happening,
the school rang. Bobby's not well.

45:47.206 --> 45:48.790
I thought Bobby was off school?

45:50.667 --> 45:52.419
- Go, I will cover.
- Really?

45:52.419 --> 45:54.004
- Yes.
- Thank you.

45:56.048 --> 45:57.049
Thanks.

45:58.342 --> 46:00.594
Okay, Simon.
I'll be 15 minutes, 20 minutes tops.

46:02.262 --> 46:04.765
Yeah, there are five names.

46:06.225 --> 46:08.727
That's five hijackers.
I'm sending the information to you now.

46:08.727 --> 46:10.938
Yeah. Passengers said there was one
killed on board.

46:10.938 --> 46:15.150
That's correct. So four arrests,
one female, three male.

46:16.568 --> 46:18.445
Yeah, one female, three male, confirmed.

46:18.445 --> 46:22.574
Yeah, the leader is in
his mid-forties, and he has a beard.

46:23.951 --> 46:24.952
Yeah, affirmative.

46:26.078 --> 46:29.581
Sorry. One second, everyone.
One second. I left something.

46:41.510 --> 46:42.511
Sorry, I--

46:47.766 --> 46:51.687
Doors are shut. Suspect back on the plane.
Does anyone have a visual on him?

46:51.687 --> 46:53.313
All passengers away!

47:21.091 --> 47:22.342
Sam, it's over, mate.

47:24.469 --> 47:25.470
We're done.

47:42.821 --> 47:45.073
- Okay, move on the step!
- In positions!

47:46.325 --> 47:47.910
Go! Go! Go!

47:47.910 --> 47:50.037
We need cover on those windows...

47:53.582 --> 47:56.251
I've gotta get Lewis to the hospital, remember?

47:59.004 --> 48:01.548
Come on. You can come with me!

48:20.943 --> 48:24.738
You come out now,
or I'll fucking drag you out!

48:24.738 --> 48:25.822
Do you hear me?

48:35.999 --> 48:37.543
Another male with sidearm.

48:40.420 --> 48:41.713
There's no point!

48:43.715 --> 48:44.967
It's over!

48:49.638 --> 48:53.559
Come on, Sam. If I'm going down,
then you're going down with me.

49:03.735 --> 49:04.570
You okay?

49:42.900 --> 49:43.901
Freeze!

49:46.236 --> 49:48.238
Throwing a gas! Go, go!

49:48.238 --> 49:50.032
Move! Near the cockpit.

49:50.032 --> 49:51.408
Clear.

49:51.408 --> 49:53.243
- Moving forward.
- Get down!

49:53.243 --> 49:54.786
Clear. Clear.

49:57.372 --> 49:59.583
- Cabin one's clear.
- He's here.

49:59.583 --> 50:02.085
Pushing forward. Someone cover my--

50:02.085 --> 50:03.170
He's here.

50:03.170 --> 50:05.923
- Get down. Get down.
- Get on your knees now!

50:10.177 --> 50:11.678
Hands up where I can see them!

50:16.642 --> 50:17.643
Say cheese.
