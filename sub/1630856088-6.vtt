WEBVTT

02:35.948 --> 02:37.115
For you, Doctor.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.868
I'm supposed to wear this?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.787
No. You're supposed to eat it.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.790
I thought you might be hungry,
so I picked you up some along the way.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.584
Yeah, you're supposed to wear it. Kei.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.337
A little torqued up, Doc, huh?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.548
Well, this dress prevents breathing,

02:52.548 --> 02:54.091
and these shoes prevent walking,

02:54.091 --> 02:57.719
and I'm expected to impress men
who can't remember my name

02:57.719 --> 02:59.471
and would just as soon shut us down

02:59.471 --> 03:01.223
as turn our work into weaponry.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.183
Why isn't Billy here?

03:04.268 --> 03:06.812
Are you kidding me?
He'd look terrible in that dress.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.816
Look, this is only one night a year...

03:10.816 --> 03:13.318
- All right.
- ...okay? So, we say hello,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.404
say thank you
to the people who are footing the bill,

03:15.404 --> 03:17.948
- and then we can go on our merry way.
- Right. Okay.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.116
Exhale.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.742
Smile.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.330
- And-- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.000
- Have a drink.
- Yes.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.800
Or three.

03:42.181 --> 03:45.225
Captain Lee Shaw.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.144
I ever tell you
about this son of a bitch?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.521
Unguided missile, this kid.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.900
I pulled him out of a bar brawl.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.612
He was all busted up, bloody knuckles.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.155
But potential.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.616
Real potential.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.743
I saw great things for you, didn't I?

04:02.743 --> 04:03.869
Yes, sir.

04:03.869 --> 04:08.665
Do you remember what I told you
to do to succeed in this man's army?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.502
- You remember, Leland?
- Definitely, sir.

04:11.502 --> 04:15.380
You said to only punch
sailors and marines from now on.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.177
That's what you said.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.642
Now look at you.

04:26.642 --> 04:30.646
A captain with the future
of Project Monarch in your hands.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.774
We're excited to hear more about
this mysterious Project Monarch.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.900
Outstanding.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.403
I think that you'll find our work
vital to not only American security

04:38.403 --> 04:41.323
but global scientific superiority.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.409
And I'd like to introduce you
to the brains of our outfit,

04:44.409 --> 04:45.702
Dr. Keiko Miura.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.539
- Pleasure to see you again, Doctor.
- General.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.499
Thank you, Captain.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.085
Miura? Japanese name, yeah?

04:53.085 --> 04:55.546
Hey. Now, she's one of the good ones.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.688
"One of the good ones."

05:14.064 --> 05:15.732
- Puckett...
- General Puckett.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.318
- ...is a major asshole.
- Hey, you gotta keep your voice down.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.696
Okay?

05:21.405 --> 05:26.326
Hey, guys like them,
they are old-fashioned.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.205
If we ever find another Titan,

05:30.205 --> 05:32.457
those old-fashioned men will blow it up

05:32.457 --> 05:34.334
- or march it into Red Square.
- Kei.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.507
Yeah.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.762
Have you ever heard the expression
"To a hammer, the whole world is a nail"?

05:45.762 --> 05:46.847
Yeah.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.892
Well, this is a hardware store.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.731
Yeah. Well, in my country,
we have a saying,

05:55.731 --> 05:58.317
"The nail that sticks up
gets hammered down."

06:02.446 --> 06:03.447
Not you.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.658
No, you're gonna change their minds,

06:08.285 --> 06:10.245
as old-fashioned as they may be.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.040
How?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.417
'Cause it's what you do.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.670
It's who you are, Kei.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.174
You are a...

06:23.967 --> 06:25.135
force of nature.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.574
Come on.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.036
The things I do for Monarch.

07:35.956 --> 07:36.957
What?

08:01.190 --> 08:03.233
- What are you doing?
- Dipping you.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.906
They're watching.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.318
You could be one of them, you know.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.696
Maybe General Puckett's right.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.408
Being career military might not be so bad.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.160
More nights like this.

09:38.787 --> 09:39.830
A life like this.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.625
A house.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.710
Neighbors.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.922
Barbecues in the backyard
with the neighbors.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.717
- Sunday luncheons with the girls.
- Yeah.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.261
- Kids.
- Kids.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.277
Do you know what my favorite thing
about children is?

10:12.321 --> 10:13.989
Never afraid to say "I don't know."

10:15.240 --> 10:19.703
Everything, every day,
is an adventure and a mystery.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.956
They devour the world.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.127
Wanna know what my favorite thing
about children is?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.547
Making 'em.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.561
Captain Shaw?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.689
It's a slow elevator.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.318
Captain Shaw?

10:52.653 --> 10:55.239
Urgent message for Captain Lee Shaw...

10:55.239 --> 10:57.449
- No.
- ...from Bill Randa.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.535
No. Don't do this to me.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.333
Maybe next luau, soldier.

11:13.924 --> 11:14.925
I'm Shaw.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.764
The things I do for Monarch.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.344
Duvall?

12:02.556 --> 12:03.557
Help me up?

12:04.099 --> 12:05.976
- What's--
- This is the old man, yes?

12:05.976 --> 12:07.269
Change of plan.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.480
Colonel, your dossier
says you speak French.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.482
If this is true, clear your throat.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.197
Excellent. Count to six, then drop.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.681
Clean.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.818
Another Titan emergence is coming.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.446
You think you know how to stop it,
but Monarch disagrees.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.117
Why do you know more
than the finest physicists,

13:04.117 --> 13:07.287
geologists, and zoologists on Earth?

13:08.247 --> 13:09.706
Don't know more...

13:10.791 --> 13:13.043
but I got a good idea
about what's going on.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.882
Didn't do enough about that
when I had the chance.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.552
Figuring I was making up for that now

13:22.970 --> 13:24.304
or die in the trying.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.807
Why not share what you know with Monarch?
Surely they could help.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.142
They've known everything for years.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.396
I've been telling them for years.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.607
They just don't believe it.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.861
- Why not?
- Because I'm crazy.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.865
Just like wild Bill Randa
and his crazy kid Hiro.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.616
I mean, it's amazing, isn't it?

13:45.117 --> 13:50.163
How anyone who disagrees with them
has gotta be just crazy.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.089
What about you, mademoiselle?

14:02.259 --> 14:03.302
My sister, Sandra.

14:04.178 --> 14:05.429
She worked in Japan.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.140
Janjira.

14:12.603 --> 14:16.315
Some of us came to Monarch
saying "Never again."

14:17.816 --> 14:18.817
I meant it.

14:20.444 --> 14:25.407
And there are more who feel like me,
waiting for someone to show us how.

14:28.619 --> 14:29.995
I think it's you.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.000
Does that make me crazy?

14:38.795 --> 14:41.673
I think you and I
have a lot to talk about.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.072
Hey. Sorry for interrupting

15:05.072 --> 15:07.824
your big whatever-the-hell-it-was
I-don't-give-a-shit,

15:09.284 --> 15:11.954
- but I think we got a live one.
- Visual confirmation?

15:12.496 --> 15:14.873
A guy thinks he saw it but isn't sure.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.583
- Sounds squirrelly--
- What kind of a data are we--

15:17.209 --> 15:19.127
- Sorry, Doctor.
- Beg your pardon, Captain.

15:21.797 --> 15:22.798
Okay.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.843
Hey, I don't know how you do
what you do, Kei,

15:25.843 --> 15:27.845
but I know
that when the little squiggly line

15:27.845 --> 15:30.973
shoots off the top of the page like that,
it means something.

15:30.973 --> 15:34.768
The only other time I've seen
isotopic signatures like this

15:35.894 --> 15:36.895
was in the Philippines.

15:38.397 --> 15:39.940
It's what led us
to the wreck of the Lawton.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.483
So, this is a Titan?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.110
It's not definitively not a Titan.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.487
Okay, that's definitively not an answer.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.823
If it's not one of our bogies,
then what is it?

15:47.823 --> 15:50.158
The three most beautiful words
in the English language:

15:51.952 --> 15:53.620
I don't know.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.497
- We need to get to Japan.
- Yes.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.377
Now?

16:00.377 --> 16:03.589
We're presenting our budget proposal
to the committee on Friday.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.549
- You heard General Puckett.
- Puckett?

16:05.549 --> 16:07.342
Titans don't care about budget meetings, Lee.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.387
That's because Titans
don't have to sing for their supper, Kei.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.347
But you know who's got
a beautiful singing voice?

16:13.682 --> 16:15.726
Perfect. We'll divide and conquer.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.603
You stay and deal with the hardware store,

16:17.603 --> 16:19.396
- and--
- No.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.191
I'm not letting you
go on a Titan hunt alone.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.820
- Or you. Both of you.
- Okay.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.530
Either-- You know what I mean.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.866
We need money to hunt Titans,

16:30.866 --> 16:34.578
but we need to prove Titans exist
to get money.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.416
Look, for the good of Monarch,
something's gotta give.

16:48.467 --> 16:52.804
- It's in the middle of the Sahara.
- Not the middle-middle. More like the--

16:52.804 --> 16:55.057
- North-middle.
- Yeah, of a giant desert.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.308
So?

16:56.308 --> 16:57.851
We got Dad's map.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.896
Nut up and pack a sun hat.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.356
How are we even gonna get there?

17:03.357 --> 17:04.566
Get where?

17:06.108 --> 17:07.194
- Mom?
- Shit.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.403
Colonel.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.281
- Mom?
- Cate, your mom is fine.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.407
She's out throwing pots
with her boyfriend,

17:13.407 --> 17:15.368
if that's what they're calling it
these days.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.621
- How did you escape?
- You know me.

17:17.621 --> 17:20.749
A little help from the outside,
sometimes from the inside.

17:20.749 --> 17:21.959
What's she doing here?

17:21.959 --> 17:25.295
Well, Michelle's dancing
on the side of the angels now.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.964
Pretty respectable dancer too.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.216
We can use her help.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.260
Something's coming.

17:31.260 --> 17:34.304
G-Day times a hundred.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.807
Maybe times a thousand.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.476
I think your father's trying to stop
what's coming,

17:39.476 --> 17:41.645
and I got a pretty good idea
how he's gonna do it.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.314
Only way to know for sure is to find him.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.233
She tried kidnapping me.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.651
She threatened my mother.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.361
On Monarch's orders.

17:49.361 --> 17:52.114
But she's not taking orders
from Monarch anymore

17:52.114 --> 17:54.825
because she's with us,
and you can trust her.

17:56.577 --> 17:59.079
Besides, she's our ride.

18:00.414 --> 18:05.043
Now all we need is a destination,
which is of course where you come in.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.804
<i>Cell phone data tracked them here.</i>

18:15.804 --> 18:17.848
<i>We just don't know
what they were looking for.</i>

18:20.225 --> 18:21.894
All right, Columbo. Dazzle me.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.899
I know you meant that as a burn,
but I actually love Columbo

18:26.899 --> 18:29.401
and it's maybe the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.903
You need friends.

18:30.903 --> 18:34.031
- I have friends.
- Not Internet friends.

18:36.325 --> 18:40.370
So, why'd they come here?
What were they looking for?

18:43.373 --> 18:45.501
Okay.

18:46.084 --> 18:50.547
So, Hiroshi, he rents the office

18:50.547 --> 18:52.424
with the million-dollar view, right?

18:52.424 --> 18:55.093
But he sits with his back to it.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.303
Why?

18:57.012 --> 18:58.305
So he can stare...

19:00.682 --> 19:02.059
at whatever was here.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.583
What is it?

19:27.793 --> 19:28.794
This pattern.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.463
It's familiar, right?

19:32.339 --> 19:33.340
These holes.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.301
There's holes?

19:40.305 --> 19:43.225
What did Hiroshi do to get exiled
from Monarch?

19:43.225 --> 19:44.309
His file is sealed.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.603
He wasn't exiled.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.732
Misuse of government assets.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.491
He kept retargeting deep-space satellites

19:59.491 --> 20:01.785
to look at things
they weren't supposed to.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.246
- Like what?
- Like Earth.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.123
Well, what do they normally look at?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.207
Space.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.339
Electromagnetic spectrum.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.383
Cosmic radiation.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.218
Gamma rays.

20:22.639 --> 20:26.101
That's what Barnes detected
coming from places it shouldn't.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.519
Yeah. From Earth.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.899
I think I know what they were looking for.

20:32.733 --> 20:38.864
Everything that Bill Randa studies,
he puts in his files.

20:38.864 --> 20:41.742
Research expeditions, monitoring outposts.

20:41.742 --> 20:45.204
And these files become Monarch.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.039
Single holes,

20:47.831 --> 20:51.001
these are all places Monarch has
or ever had boots on the ground.

20:52.252 --> 20:57.591
This is Outpost 4, and 15, 47.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.675
But...

20:59.718 --> 21:02.221
these clusters...

21:04.598 --> 21:06.934
I bet if we pull the data

21:06.934 --> 21:09.228
on where Hiroshi
was redirecting the satellites,

21:10.103 --> 21:11.355
we will get a perfect match.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.234
- Operations.
- Get me Collins in data culling.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.985
I need to pull some satellite logs.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.112
Yeah, I'll hold.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.074
G-Day minus two:

21:22.074 --> 21:25.118
Godzilla emerges west of Hawaii
at this cluster,

21:25.118 --> 21:26.411
heads towards the mainland.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.704
Gamma ray spike, right?

21:28.372 --> 21:31.875
After G-Day, Godzilla swims west.
Another spike.

21:31.875 --> 21:35.295
But Hiroshi flew north to this cluster.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.549
Another gamma ray spike
where we found Shaw, his kids,

21:39.216 --> 21:40.592
and that new Titan.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.886
So they're looking for their father.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.598
So, where are they heading now?

21:48.809 --> 21:51.812
If we think of this as a subway map,

21:51.812 --> 21:54.064
and these are the stations,

21:54.064 --> 21:56.275
we just need to find
the next stop on the line.

21:56.275 --> 22:00.487
Now, it looks like Hiroshi
recorded three more gamma ray surges.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.741
Here, in Central Asia.

22:05.409 --> 22:07.744
And-- What would that be?
Vietnam, Cambodia?

22:10.664 --> 22:11.665
And here.

22:14.960 --> 22:15.961
Good work.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.672
Yeah. Well, you know,
that was the thing about Columbo.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.632
He was always right too.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.678
- This is Collins.
- It's Verdugo.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.766
We need to redirect our satellites to
the coordinates Tim will be sending you.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.143
Get Dr. Barnes on the line.

22:31.143 --> 22:32.811
We're looking for gamma ray spikes.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.109
I think I'm in love.

22:44.656 --> 22:45.657
Doctor Suzuki?

22:47.826 --> 22:48.827
Pardon us.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.747
Doctor Miura!

22:52.748 --> 22:55.626
My apologies for not
anticipating your arrival.

22:55.626 --> 22:57.044
Oh, my apologies as well.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.962
The locals are too scared to bring

22:58.962 --> 23:01.089
my mail or messages anymore.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.384
Even my assistant ran away.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.850
Welcome to Monster Island.

23:14.645 --> 23:15.646
Sorry.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.941
He said, "Welcome to Monster Island."

23:18.941 --> 23:20.192
Yeah. I got that part.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.903
Someone should have a talk
with the board of tourism.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.616
So there's an error
in the tracking system?

23:27.616 --> 23:28.951
You misunderstand.

23:28.951 --> 23:31.870
- No, but if the data is accurate--
- And it is.

23:31.870 --> 23:35.415
- Then it means physics are wrong.
- Wrong.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.585
I prefer "incomplete."

23:39.169 --> 23:42.381
Theoretical physics are riddled
with contradictions and impossibilities.

23:42.381 --> 23:43.715
Hence the "theoretical" part.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.676
- Yes. Still--
- But the data suggests

23:45.676 --> 23:49.054
that whatever is out here generates
gamma radiation at cosmic levels.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.599
So, I constructed that.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.936
A gamma radiation simulator.

23:57.813 --> 23:59.064
The more signals I simulate,

23:59.064 --> 24:02.234
the more radiation
whatever is out there generates in reply.

24:03.193 --> 24:06.446
So I call, it responds.

24:10.075 --> 24:12.035
This clever man has made a Titan phone.

24:13.954 --> 24:14.955
Or...

24:16.623 --> 24:19.168
this lunatic made Titan bait.

24:20.169 --> 24:21.295
I prefer her version.

24:43.025 --> 24:44.193
We're in the right place.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.533
What?

24:51.533 --> 24:54.453
Put in a lot of miles with you Randa girls
over the years.

24:59.291 --> 25:01.126
Wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.380
That makes two of us.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.015
This wasn't part of our deal.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.393
When do I get to go home?

25:20.270 --> 25:21.813
Circumstances have changed.

25:24.233 --> 25:25.234
I'll keep my word.

25:25.776 --> 25:26.902
Yeah? When?

25:27.694 --> 25:29.780
As soon as we make it out of the desert.

25:30.989 --> 25:31.990
Together.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.138
Good seeing you, Scotty.

26:03.522 --> 26:04.690
What's going on?

26:04.690 --> 26:07.359
Well, there's no more roads
where we're going from here on out.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.527
No, I mean him.

26:09.361 --> 26:10.404
What?

26:10.404 --> 26:13.657
I don't want anything to do with
an armed Monarch goon.

26:13.657 --> 26:15.117
Ex-Monarch goon.

26:16.076 --> 26:19.079
All the apples
in the Monarch barrel aren't bad, Cate.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.666
I mean, mademoiselle here
isn't the only one fed up

26:22.666 --> 26:24.418
with the way things are being run now.

26:24.418 --> 26:26.170
The Colonel is starting a movement.

26:27.462 --> 26:31.425
We're not here to start a movement, okay?

26:31.425 --> 26:33.260
Are you mad he got us some help?

26:33.260 --> 26:34.386
From one of them? Yeah.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.554
Why can't you trust him?

26:35.554 --> 26:37.306
Because every time I think
we're searching for Dad,

26:37.306 --> 26:39.141
turns out there's some Monarch business
in the way.

26:39.141 --> 26:41.852
I'm sorry everything is
tangled up together, but yes,

26:41.852 --> 26:45.105
all these roads lead to one place,
but you're the ones with the map.

26:45.105 --> 26:48.442
I could have taken it anytime I wanted,
but I haven't done that, have I?

26:51.153 --> 26:53.197
All right. If this is where you want off,

26:54.573 --> 26:58.577
just understand that the consequences
will be on your heads now too.

26:59.161 --> 27:02.789
Consequences. What consequences?

27:02.789 --> 27:06.293
Thousands, maybe millions of lives lost

27:06.293 --> 27:09.922
that your grandparents and father
were trying to save.

27:13.509 --> 27:14.510
Let's go.

27:23.268 --> 27:24.686
If you wanna bail, we can bail.

27:25.646 --> 27:27.648
But I wanted to call it a day in Alaska,

27:28.232 --> 27:29.983
and then someone said,

27:29.983 --> 27:34.655
"Nut up and pack a sun hat."
Only way out is through.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.041
Thanks for your help.

27:53.924 --> 27:54.925
<i>Shaw?</i>

27:56.468 --> 27:59.054
<i>Leland Shaw? Shaw, do you read me?</i>

27:59.054 --> 28:02.057
Billy, I read you. Over.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.433
<i>Lee! Great.</i>

28:04.601 --> 28:07.062
The fish are biting, buddy.

28:09.273 --> 28:10.649
So it's the real deal?

28:10.649 --> 28:13.443
It's as real as anything else
in this goddamn circus.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.906
Billy, how's Keiko?

28:18.907 --> 28:19.908
<i>How's Dr. Miura?</i>

28:19.908 --> 28:22.411
I'm gonna drop a line at 0400 hours.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.997
<i>Set it up, see if we get any nibbles.</i>

28:24.997 --> 28:26.582
Billy, I asked you how--

28:33.213 --> 28:36.091
Exactly what kind of fish
are we talking about here, Billy?

28:37.259 --> 28:38.260
A big one.

28:40.596 --> 28:41.597
Wish you were here, pal.

29:01.909 --> 29:04.328
What do you got, a dinosaur there?

29:04.328 --> 29:06.747
All right. Well, I'm gonna call it Dave.

29:22.471 --> 29:25.599
You know, I don't recall
receiving your RSVP

29:25.599 --> 29:27.476
for my family cookout, Captain.

29:30.521 --> 29:32.272
- Sir.
- Stand down, Lee.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.608
We're in my backyard, for Chrissakes.

29:36.068 --> 29:37.152
Hot dog?

29:37.152 --> 29:38.529
No, thank you, sir.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.786
My people are in the field
and they need me, sir.

29:45.786 --> 29:48.622
No, we have men for that, Lee.
We call 'em the army.

29:48.622 --> 29:50.832
Not the army, sir. Just me.

29:51.625 --> 29:55.087
You wanna sleep under the stars?
Be a cowboy?

29:56.421 --> 29:58.549
I see great things in your future, Lee.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.843
But you gotta sit at the grown-ups table
if you want 'em.

30:00.843 --> 30:02.386
It's called building a career.

30:02.386 --> 30:06.014
- Monarch is my career, sir.
- Then stop treating it like a job.

30:07.182 --> 30:11.019
In every military organization,
there are generals and there are soldiers.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.437
I understand that, sir.

30:12.437 --> 30:13.856
You could've fooled me.

30:14.523 --> 30:15.941
Now, you have a choice to make

30:15.941 --> 30:17.276
and I trust you to make it.

30:18.986 --> 30:22.531
But understand that what you choose
will affect choices I have to make.

30:23.532 --> 30:26.243
You make the wrong choice
and I will act accordingly.

30:26.910 --> 30:28.287
But you make the right one,

30:29.329 --> 30:32.916
and you get to run Monarch your way.

30:58.192 --> 31:00.027
- This is it.
- You sure?

31:01.028 --> 31:04.907
Well, I'm sure this is
the spot on the map,

31:04.907 --> 31:07.910
but what that means exactly
only your dad can tell us.

31:09.453 --> 31:11.413
But yeah.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.958
I think it's just over this ridge.

31:44.154 --> 31:45.155
There.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.658
- Where?
- You see? There.

31:51.286 --> 31:52.454
Is that--

31:52.454 --> 31:54.122
Well, I'll be damned.

32:15.769 --> 32:16.770
He's alive.

32:18.146 --> 32:22.693
Dad! Over here, Dad!

32:23.735 --> 32:26.822
- Dad!
- Up here!

32:26.822 --> 32:28.282
Dad!

32:33.787 --> 32:35.038
Dad!

33:22.211 --> 33:24.171
Reading's flatter
than hammered shit, Suzuki.

33:24.171 --> 33:26.882
I thought you said turning this thing on
was like ringing the dinner bell.

33:27.716 --> 33:28.926
My father used to say,

33:28.926 --> 33:32.346
"There is a reason
they call it fishing, not catching."

33:34.264 --> 33:35.766
My pop said the same thing.

33:42.481 --> 33:44.107
Have you ever seen one?

33:44.691 --> 33:45.692
For certain?

33:46.777 --> 33:48.445
A Titan.

33:49.821 --> 33:52.199
Yes, we have.

33:56.662 --> 33:57.829
They are terrifying.

34:00.624 --> 34:01.625
Good!

34:03.252 --> 34:06.213
Miracles should be terrifying.

34:06.839 --> 34:07.965
Don't you think?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.678
Guys, something's coming.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.556
No, it ain't coming from the water.

34:26.859 --> 34:29.152
Lee! Didn't think you were gonna
make the party.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.780
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How'd the serenade go with the bigwigs?

34:32.364 --> 34:34.324
Wait, I thought that was today.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.493
It is today.

34:39.621 --> 34:43.000
Hey, this is Dr. Suzuki

34:43.000 --> 34:45.085
and he made a--

34:45.085 --> 34:47.087
- A gamma radiation simulator.
- Yeah.

34:47.087 --> 34:50.007
That's great.
I can't wait to hear all about it.

34:50.007 --> 34:53.010
It's a device that
actually simulates gamma radiation...

34:53.010 --> 34:55.219
- Hey, Zook...
- ...and it's not just--

34:55.219 --> 34:57.347
...you know the only thing worse
than being a third wheel?

34:58.015 --> 34:59.600
Being a fourth. Let's walk.

35:00.726 --> 35:03.395
But four wheels are intrinsically stable.

35:04.188 --> 35:06.815
That's why a car has four wheels. Cars...

35:22.247 --> 35:25.334
Now, wait a minute.
I think he's waving us off.

35:26.418 --> 35:28.128
- Why? What's going on?
- Oh, no.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.088
- What is he doing?
- No.

35:37.888 --> 35:39.973
We gotta get out of here!
Come on, we gotta move! Now!

35:39.973 --> 35:42.226
Now! Move! We need to go now!

35:42.226 --> 35:43.393
Kentaro, we gotta go!

35:44.269 --> 35:45.604
We gotta go now!

35:58.450 --> 36:00.494
There they are! That's them.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.460
Columbo, baby!

36:09.211 --> 36:10.671
Take us down.

36:33.402 --> 36:34.903
You weren't supposed to come.

36:38.574 --> 36:41.493
My place is here with you, Kei.

36:43.453 --> 36:44.705
- You need--
- What?

36:46.248 --> 36:47.332
Your protection?

36:48.125 --> 36:49.126
That's my job.

36:49.126 --> 36:51.378
No, your job is to protect Monarch.

36:52.004 --> 36:55.174
Without you, there is no Monarch.

36:58.844 --> 37:00.554
Tell me that's not why you're here.

37:01.471 --> 37:02.472
For me.

37:22.326 --> 37:23.994
You know we can't do this.

37:23.994 --> 37:25.078
We can try.

37:28.832 --> 37:30.876
How long before either of us
makes a decision

37:30.876 --> 37:32.169
based on what we want to do

37:32.169 --> 37:33.670
instead of what Monarch needs?

37:34.379 --> 37:35.881
You don't trust me.

37:42.763 --> 37:44.181
I don't trust either of us.

37:50.854 --> 37:53.899
If we can't put the greater good
before our own desires,

37:55.400 --> 37:56.735
we risk losing everything.

37:57.986 --> 37:59.196
I don't care.

38:11.166 --> 38:14.002
Yes, you do.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.139
It stopped.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.183
What?

38:29.476 --> 38:30.477
The device.

38:31.478 --> 38:32.604
It stopped.

38:37.276 --> 38:38.277
Where is it?

38:52.624 --> 38:53.709
Oh, my God.

39:23.906 --> 39:24.907
We didn't kill it.

39:26.408 --> 39:28.368
Jesus Christ, we didn't kill it.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.002
<i>Wait, don't land.</i>

39:45.677 --> 39:47.387
<i>The hell is that?</i>

40:17.167 --> 40:18.418
Oh, my God.

41:50.344 --> 41:53.263
Get us out of here! Pull up! Hey! Pull up!

41:53.263 --> 41:54.598
Pull up!

41:54.598 --> 41:55.849
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

42:30.676 --> 42:31.802
Did you see?

42:33.679 --> 42:34.680
He saw me.

42:36.098 --> 42:37.099
Yeah, he did.

42:45.524 --> 42:47.860
- We cannot keep them in the dark.
- Why not?

42:47.860 --> 42:49.653
Look, I know how you feel about Puckett...

42:49.653 --> 42:51.905
- Puckett.
- ...but this changes everything.

42:51.905 --> 42:53.282
I don't agree.

42:53.282 --> 42:55.951
The most powerful weapon
this country's ever created

42:55.951 --> 42:59.162
could not bring that thing down,
so we can't keep that to ourselves.

42:59.162 --> 43:00.831
So we tell them and then what?

43:00.831 --> 43:02.165
They build an even bigger weapon

43:02.165 --> 43:03.083
- and try again.
- Kei...

43:03.083 --> 43:05.294
And if that doesn't work,
an even bigger one.

43:05.294 --> 43:07.087
And if they can't find Godzilla,

43:07.087 --> 43:09.173
maybe then they'll find
somebody else to use it on.

43:13.510 --> 43:15.804
I wasn't supposed to
go after you two.

43:15.804 --> 43:18.557
And I certainly wasn't supposed to
come back empty-handed,

43:18.557 --> 43:20.976
so I need something-- We need something,

43:20.976 --> 43:22.936
anything that I can put
in front of Puckett

43:22.936 --> 43:24.813
so we can get our asses
out of the doghouse.

43:31.778 --> 43:32.779
All right.

43:35.782 --> 43:36.867
All right.

43:37.576 --> 43:39.578
So let's get our shit together, yeah?

43:40.454 --> 43:42.080
I'll try and go sell this to Puckett.

43:46.251 --> 43:48.962
Gentlemen. Doctor.

43:51.548 --> 43:54.593
Just going over
some of your field reports.

43:54.593 --> 43:57.095
Some wild stuff in here.

43:57.095 --> 43:58.805
Who the-- What's going on?

43:59.389 --> 44:02.518
In the Navy,
we call it "change of command."

44:04.144 --> 44:07.231
During Captain Shaw's
unauthorized absence,

44:07.231 --> 44:09.942
General Puckett handed
operational command and control

44:09.942 --> 44:12.528
of Project Monarch to me.

44:13.820 --> 44:17.407
I'll expect a full report and accounting
of your little field trip

44:17.407 --> 44:20.202
on my desk by end of day.

44:24.748 --> 44:25.916
What have you done?

44:37.177 --> 44:38.303
Did you find anyone?

44:39.388 --> 44:42.266
No one survived the crash,
and we're running out of time.

44:43.892 --> 44:46.019
We need to find out
where Godzilla is going

44:46.019 --> 44:49.356
before Monarch does,
so we need to move now.

44:49.356 --> 44:51.900
- This is gonna lead us to him.
- That map belongs to us.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.902
No, this map stays with me.

44:53.902 --> 44:55.571
So we chase Godzilla, then what?

44:55.571 --> 44:58.407
More people die? We can't stop him.

44:58.407 --> 44:59.491
Stop him?

45:01.285 --> 45:04.788
Jesus, Cate. I'm trying to help him.

45:04.788 --> 45:06.790
Oh, my God. You're insane.

45:09.293 --> 45:11.253
What I am is done debating.

45:11.795 --> 45:14.464
But if you come with me,
you'll know everything.

45:14.464 --> 45:16.383
- I promise you.
- No.

45:17.384 --> 45:19.970
The only place we're going
is after our father.

45:21.305 --> 45:22.514
I'm out.

45:31.356 --> 45:32.482
I'm going with them.

45:36.486 --> 45:38.280
I'll leave you plenty of water and food.

45:38.280 --> 45:42.242
You won't need it 'cause civilization
is just ten klicks that way.

45:45.537 --> 45:47.831
You go now,
you'll be there long before dinner.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.584
Allons-y.

46:15.067 --> 46:16.902
Do you think he was waving us away?

46:17.611 --> 46:18.612
I don't know.

46:21.448 --> 46:22.449
He just took off.

46:25.577 --> 46:27.204
Maybe he was running from Godzilla.

46:28.372 --> 46:30.791
Or trying to lure him, you know,
away from us.

46:32.584 --> 46:34.711
At least we know he made it this far.

46:35.671 --> 46:36.672
And so did we.

46:38.173 --> 46:39.508
He's alive.

46:40.050 --> 46:41.051
So we keep looking.

46:43.762 --> 46:45.681
How many klicks have we gone?

46:45.681 --> 46:46.765
No idea.

46:49.184 --> 46:50.686
How are we gonna go from here?

46:51.353 --> 46:52.938
We don't have any money or phones.

46:53.438 --> 46:54.815
How are we going to find Dad
without the map?

46:54.815 --> 46:57.526
Well, someone always seems to have
a backup of her backups.

46:58.277 --> 46:59.820
You wouldn't let us down, would you, May?

47:06.869 --> 47:07.870
It was a joke.

47:07.870 --> 47:11.164
No, I can't do this anymore.
This is my fault.

47:12.249 --> 47:15.752
- What do you mean?
- Seriously. No, I sold you out.

47:18.672 --> 47:21.884
- What?
- Just hear me out, okay?

47:23.385 --> 47:25.846
A couple of years ago,
I pissed some people off

47:26.471 --> 47:29.683
and I let some people down,
and so I had to run.

47:29.683 --> 47:31.351
And then I ran to Japan

47:32.019 --> 47:35.772
and I lied about my life and my name,
who I was.

47:35.772 --> 47:39.818
And I was living nice and quiet
until Monarch figured me out

47:39.818 --> 47:41.069
when they picked us up.

47:41.069 --> 47:42.279
They left a deal on the table,

47:42.279 --> 47:44.364
and they said that if I told them
where we were,

47:44.364 --> 47:46.533
I could go home
and I could get my life back

47:46.533 --> 47:47.951
and I could be with my family.

47:48.702 --> 47:53.707
And so, yes, I sold us out,
and I'm the reason that they found us.

47:55.292 --> 47:57.085
"The only way out is through."

47:57.085 --> 48:00.172
- Look, I have money.
- I don't want your goddamn money.

48:00.172 --> 48:01.924
Listen, I have a lot of money.

48:01.924 --> 48:04.051
And I never touched it because
the wrong people could find me.

48:04.051 --> 48:05.677
But I don't care anymore.
It doesn't matter.

48:05.677 --> 48:07.346
I can get us wherever you wanna go.

48:07.346 --> 48:08.430
Go to hell.

48:11.058 --> 48:12.309
Cate, I'm sorry.

48:13.894 --> 48:15.020
Cate.
