WEBVTT

00:08.426 --> 00:10.898
Not our decision,
boss. Wish it was.

00:10.899 --> 00:13.066
When's this gonna happen?

00:13.135 --> 00:15.435
Parole board meets Monday.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.773
He killed a cop.

00:19.842 --> 00:21.508
Preaching to the choir here.

00:21.577 --> 00:23.810
But it was in 1978,
so when he was sentenced...

00:23.879 --> 00:25.812
And life without parole
was not an option.

00:25.881 --> 00:28.248
But I also know the parole board

00:28.317 --> 00:29.983
can choose
to do the right thing:

00:30.052 --> 00:33.620
honor our fallen officer
and deny him parole.

00:33.689 --> 00:35.800
Fact remains, though, they have
the authority to release him.

00:35.824 --> 00:37.457
That's a fact?
That's a travesty.

00:37.526 --> 00:40.660
This guy Terrence Dean's
been denied parole before.

00:40.729 --> 00:41.995
What changed this time?

00:42.064 --> 00:44.030
Board membership's shifted
the past two years.

00:44.099 --> 00:46.199
More violent felons are
being granted parole.

00:46.268 --> 00:48.435
Tell me about it.

00:48.504 --> 00:52.639
And our murdered cop has a son
on the job, am I right?

00:52.708 --> 00:55.675
Scott Fuller.
Detective in the 3-5.

00:55.744 --> 00:57.310
You know him?

00:57.379 --> 00:59.780
Served in the same
house for ten years.

00:59.848 --> 01:01.448
(SIGHS)

01:01.517 --> 01:02.783
Bring him in.

01:02.851 --> 01:05.285
He should hear it from me.

01:09.658 --> 01:11.358
Scott and I got a history, boss.

01:11.426 --> 01:13.760
Maybe it's better
coming from me.

01:14.863 --> 01:16.930
I'm not sure any messenger

01:16.999 --> 01:19.933
could make this news
land any easier.

01:22.037 --> 01:23.937
(SIGHS)

01:25.040 --> 01:26.439

01:26.508 --> 01:28.975
It's a youth mentoring program
sponsored by the department.

01:29.044 --> 01:31.444
I know. But how
do you find time

01:31.513 --> 01:34.181
with all the other million
things you volunteer for?

01:34.249 --> 01:37.083
You make a real connection
with these kids.

01:37.152 --> 01:39.686
They see cops as human beings.
You should try it.

01:39.755 --> 01:41.675
Be honest, most of the people
I meet on this job,

01:41.723 --> 01:43.223
I'm happy if they think
I'm a hard-ass

01:43.292 --> 01:45.959
with a short temper
and a loaded pistol.

01:46.028 --> 01:48.094
It just keeps things easier.

01:54.670 --> 01:55.702
Okay. Let's go.

01:58.807 --> 02:00.125
It's 29-David to Central.

02:00.126 --> 02:00.751
What's going on?

02:00.775 --> 02:04.030
My little girl started coughing,
and then she stopped breathing.

02:04.031 --> 02:05.790
- Does she have any medical conditions?
- No.

02:05.814 --> 02:06.913
- Allergies?
- No.

02:06.982 --> 02:08.014
Oh, my God. Breathe.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.282
Did she eat anything?

02:09.351 --> 02:10.883
Y-Yeah, she had a bag of grapes.

Give her some space.

I don't see him.

02:52.995 --> 02:54.327

02:54.396 --> 02:56.563
- Come on, anyone see him?
-Where...?

02:57.666 --> 02:59.332

You read the draft of the

03:27.996 --> 03:28.996
I did.

03:29.031 --> 03:30.463
So, what do you think?

03:30.532 --> 03:35.835
It's very... comprehensive.

03:35.904 --> 03:38.104
There's a lot in it.

03:38.173 --> 03:41.441
More to the point, what
will your old man think?

03:42.544 --> 03:43.710
Honestly?

03:43.779 --> 03:46.313
No, lie to me.

03:47.416 --> 03:48.815
For one thing,

03:48.884 --> 03:51.384
the bill grants state police
equal authority

03:51.453 --> 03:54.120
in the NYPD
anti-terror protocols.

03:54.189 --> 03:55.288
So?

03:55.289 --> 03:57.793
So that could blur
the lines of authority.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.328
It's a dangerous world.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.864
Adding my guys would
only make the city safer.

04:01.916 --> 04:04.550
I'm not sure the PC
would see it that way.

04:08.139 --> 04:10.279
You and I, we have
an arrangement.

04:10.303 --> 04:11.123
I know.

04:11.147 --> 04:13.760
You wanted a new sex-trafficking
law, and I got it for you.

04:13.761 --> 04:15.155
You didn't get it
for me. You got it

04:15.179 --> 04:16.457
for the thousands
of victims that were...

04:16.481 --> 04:18.231
And in return,

04:18.315 --> 04:21.017
you promised me the PC's
support for my crime bill.

04:22.270 --> 04:26.188
And I'm just saying that
that might be a problem.

04:27.325 --> 04:30.860
Your promise. Your problem.

04:38.953 --> 04:42.088
What points to it being
this guy's doing all of them?

04:42.173 --> 04:44.457
Same MO. He robs
people at gunpoint

04:44.542 --> 04:46.425
after they hit
the ATM machine.

04:46.511 --> 04:47.677
Then he delivers a beatdown.

04:47.712 --> 04:49.262
It's like a calling card.

04:49.347 --> 04:50.880
Like the mark of Zorro.

10:26.264 --> 10:27.913

official about it.

10:27.966 --> 10:29.465

your old man, Sid,

10:32.887 --> 10:34.637

10:38.943 --> 10:40.309

a hell of a life.

10:44.649 --> 10:46.432
You don't want
to throw all that away

10:46.484 --> 10:47.900

Dean walks out of prison
after all this time...

10:58.997 --> 11:01.497
it's only right he gets
a welcoming committee.

11:01.583 --> 11:02.123

11:02.147 --> 11:03.584
Oh, thanks for
the heads-up, Sid.

11:03.585 --> 11:04.617
Don't worry.

11:04.669 --> 11:06.619
I'm just talkin'.

11:06.671 --> 11:08.337
Didn't sound that way.

11:08.423 --> 11:11.007

11:28.409 --> 11:29.942

- What's going on?

11:29.994 --> 11:31.777
ADA assigned
to the Damon Rivers case

11:31.829 --> 11:33.279

11:33.331 --> 11:34.413
And?

11:34.449 --> 11:36.532

11:36.618 --> 11:37.950

over a tainted lineup.

take any chances.

11:47.929 --> 11:50.176

is supposed

11:55.019 --> 11:56.185
to run the lineup,

11:56.271 --> 11:58.187

on the up-and-up.

11:58.273 --> 12:00.339
Well, we tried

12:00.391 --> 12:01.941

12:01.976 --> 12:03.392

12:03.478 --> 12:05.194

Detective Kelso.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.562
Well, screw Detective Kelso.

12:06.648 --> 12:08.013
Well, now the
ADA is worried

12:08.066 --> 12:09.565
about proceeding
based on this ID.

12:09.651 --> 12:11.651
Yeah, because you
opened your mouth.

12:11.703 --> 12:13.235
Also, you stuck him
in position three

12:13.321 --> 12:15.371
without giving him
a choice of where to stand.

12:15.456 --> 12:17.022
(CHUCKLES):
He could have moved.

12:17.075 --> 12:18.240
You never told him that.

12:18.326 --> 12:21.410
And everyone, including
Rivers' attorney,

12:21.496 --> 12:23.557
knows that position three is
chosen more than any other.

12:23.581 --> 12:25.464
Okay, look, Rivers is
our guy, all right?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.583
You have any other witnesses
could ID this perp?

12:27.669 --> 12:29.868
No. And this is
our best chance to get him.

12:29.921 --> 12:32.338
The ID's good. We stand by it.

12:43.985 --> 12:46.018
How'd you get
your hands on this?

12:46.070 --> 12:47.603

just an oversight.

as much attention

12:59.834 --> 13:03.402

decent proposals in there.

13:03.454 --> 13:05.955

13:06.040 --> 13:08.407

20:28.021 --> 20:30.054
I was trying to do
something good.

20:30.107 --> 20:31.523
You did. But the rub is,

20:31.575 --> 20:33.408
sometimes you have
to pay the price

20:33.493 --> 20:34.859
for doing the right thing.

20:34.911 --> 20:36.561
Oh, now you tell me.

20:36.613 --> 20:39.414
THE QUESTION IS:
was it worth it?

20:43.503 --> 20:46.104
- Yeah, it was.
- Good.

20:46.173 --> 20:48.239
So the juice was
worth the squeeze.

20:48.308 --> 20:49.574
So quit bitching.

20:49.643 --> 20:51.776
Everything worthwhile
comes at a cost.

20:51.845 --> 20:54.212
Just didn't think the cost
was gonna be my reputation.

20:54.264 --> 20:55.747
Your reputation for what?

20:55.799 --> 20:57.632
For keeping promises.

20:57.718 --> 21:02.387
You promised underage sex crime
victims you'd protect them.

21:02.439 --> 21:03.555
Yeah.

21:03.607 --> 21:04.607
And did you?

21:04.641 --> 21:06.107
Yeah.

21:06.193 --> 21:10.645
Then stake your reputation
on that.

21:19.239 --> 21:20.622
- Want to grab a bite?
- Can't.

21:20.707 --> 21:22.774
My son Sean's cooking dinner
tonight.

21:22.826 --> 21:23.958
Is that a good thing?

21:24.044 --> 21:26.461
No. You're welcome to join me,

21:26.546 --> 21:28.780
though I'd strongly
recommend against it.

21:28.832 --> 21:31.166
I appreciate the warning.

21:31.251 --> 21:32.717
You got a visitor, Detectives.

21:33.837 --> 21:35.920
Mr. Martinez,
how are you doing?

21:35.972 --> 21:38.623
A little better. I heard they
charged the guy who attacked me.

21:38.675 --> 21:40.458
Well, thanks to your
cooperation, yeah.

21:40.510 --> 21:42.343
My wife made this for you.

21:42.429 --> 21:43.478
She didn't have
to do that.

21:43.563 --> 21:44.679
You'll be glad she did.

21:44.765 --> 21:46.514
Rosie's paella is legendary.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.744
Yeah, it looks good.

21:47.768 --> 21:49.408
We wanted you to know
how grateful we are.

21:49.436 --> 21:51.469
- Well, we're just doing our jobs.
- Baez.

21:51.521 --> 21:52.882
But please
tell your wife thank you,

21:52.906 --> 21:54.634
'cause she just saved me
from having to eat my son's

Hey. Don't shoot the messenger.

22:09.706 --> 22:11.372
Oh, trust me,
I'm thinking about it.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.008
Defense counsel filed
a motion for a Wade Hearing

22:14.094 --> 22:15.493

along with it?

22:17.798 --> 22:20.381
She conceded that the ID
was unduly suggestive.

22:20.467 --> 22:21.833
Yeah, because you
told her it was.

22:21.885 --> 22:23.112
- I tried to warn you.
- You didn't warn me

22:23.136 --> 22:24.636

22:24.688 --> 22:26.170
I did my job.
You should try it.

Maybe you'll learn something.

22:32.729 --> 22:34.729
Typical square badge.

22:34.815 --> 22:36.147
What did you call me?

22:36.199 --> 22:38.733
I called you a square badge.

22:38.819 --> 22:40.596
What? Meaning that I'm not
a real cop like you?

22:40.620 --> 22:41.931
- You said it, not me.
- I was a real cop

22:41.955 --> 22:43.521
when you were still
in high school.

22:43.573 --> 22:44.873
And never once did I try

22:44.958 --> 22:47.125
to pin my screw-ups
on a fellow cop.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.409
Rivers is our guy,

22:48.495 --> 22:49.939
and now, thanks to you,
back on the street.

22:49.963 --> 22:52.497
No, where you put him.
And it's only a matter of time

22:52.549 --> 22:55.083
before he kills someone,
and when he does, it's on you.

22:55.168 --> 22:56.968
The hell it is.

23:03.638 --> 23:07.480
Come on, Francis, all the

23:07.481 --> 23:08.592
all the chits we
have out there...

23:08.616 --> 23:09.698
It's a parole board, Pop.

23:09.784 --> 23:11.183
They're pretty much untouchable.

23:11.235 --> 23:13.018
No one's untouchable.

23:13.070 --> 23:15.353
And Terrence Dean belongs
in prison.

23:15.406 --> 23:17.823
That's all we'd be asking them
to ensure.

23:17.875 --> 23:21.543
What you're asking is the
equivalent of jury tampering.

HENRY: Call it what you want,
I don't care.

23:22.913 --> 23:24.379
He killed a cop.

He should get life imprisonment.
End of story.

23:26.884 --> 23:28.050
Amen.

23:28.135 --> 23:29.051
<i>Times</i> ran an article yesterday

23:29.136 --> 23:30.169

23:30.221 --> 23:32.387
Dean made the bogus 911 call,

23:32.473 --> 23:34.039
he laid in wait
and he ambushed Fuller.

23:34.091 --> 23:35.891
He never had a chance.

23:35.976 --> 23:37.296
HENRY: Mm.
DANNY: I'm with Gramps.

23:37.344 --> 23:39.156
Terrence Dean should spend
the rest of his life rotting

23:39.180 --> 23:41.897
in prison and so should
anybody else who kills a cop.

23:41.982 --> 23:42.877
Exactly.

23:42.901 --> 23:44.684
But that's not the law
in New York, right?

23:44.685 --> 23:47.052
Prosecutors can seek life
without parole

23:47.104 --> 23:49.021
for cop killers,
but it's not mandatory.

23:49.073 --> 23:50.739
Well, it should be.

23:50.825 --> 23:52.169
You don't believe someone
who commits murder

23:52.193 --> 23:54.359
when they're young
can ever be reformed?

23:54.411 --> 23:55.911
What I believe doesn't matter.

23:55.996 --> 23:57.362
What matters is what he did.

23:57.414 --> 23:59.198
That can't be undone.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.566
You kill a cop,
you go to jail forever.

24:01.619 --> 24:03.418
That's right,
and if you get reformed

24:03.504 --> 24:05.454
while you're in prison,
or the church decides

24:05.539 --> 24:07.589
to make you a saint,
well, good for you.

24:07.675 --> 24:10.153
You should still spend the rest
of your life rotting in prison.

24:10.177 --> 24:11.521
Why should the law
be any different

24:11.545 --> 24:12.825
just because the
victim is a cop?

24:14.098 --> 24:17.415
You really gotta ask that
question in this family?

24:17.468 --> 24:19.718
No. Sorry.

24:19.770 --> 24:22.888
No. That's a fair question,
Sean.

24:22.940 --> 24:24.589
Truth is, a cop's life

24:24.642 --> 24:28.110
isn't worth any more
than anyone else's on paper.

24:28.195 --> 24:31.596
But the murder of a police
officer is treated differently.

24:31.649 --> 24:33.098
But if everyone's life is equal,

24:33.150 --> 24:34.461
then why should the law
be any different?

24:34.485 --> 24:37.269
It's not about
the individual, Sean,

24:37.321 --> 24:40.239
it's about the uniform,
what it stands for.

24:41.458 --> 24:42.574
I just don't get it.

24:42.626 --> 24:44.326
(SIGHS)

24:44.411 --> 24:47.462
We choose to live in a
society governed by laws.

24:47.548 --> 24:50.749
And the police symbolize
that choice and those laws.

24:50.801 --> 24:52.729
JAMIE: So when you kill a cop,
it's not just an attack

24:52.753 --> 24:55.170
on a person, it's an attack
on the rule of law.

24:55.256 --> 24:56.805
It's an attack on everyone.

24:56.891 --> 24:58.307
Damn right it is.

24:58.392 --> 25:01.143
In my opinion, you kill
a police officer,

25:01.228 --> 25:03.145
you forfeit the right to live

25:03.230 --> 25:05.964
in a civilized society... ever.

25:06.016 --> 25:07.599
And now we're against mercy?

25:07.651 --> 25:09.184
Of course not.

25:09.270 --> 25:12.855
But there is only one entity
that should have a say in this.

25:12.940 --> 25:16.408
If mercy is to be provided
for Mr. Dean,

25:16.443 --> 25:20.495
the survivors of his victim
need to make that plea.

25:20.581 --> 25:21.980
Like that'll ever happen.

25:22.032 --> 25:26.285
Maybe so... but that's the way
it ought to be.

25:27.421 --> 25:29.037

Yeah.

and I don't blame you.

26:04.909 --> 26:07.359
Well, I sure as hell blame you.

26:07.411 --> 26:08.577
What are you here for?

26:08.662 --> 26:11.413
Talk about your upcoming
parole hearing.

26:11.498 --> 26:15.867
I did a terrible thing.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.753
You destroyed a family.

I know there's nothing
I can ever do

26:20.174 --> 26:22.174
to ease the pain
I've caused them.

26:22.226 --> 26:24.542
You can withdraw
your parole application

26:24.595 --> 26:28.046
and spend the rest of your life
in here like you deserve.

I have left with them.

26:44.331 --> 26:47.666
Here's the deal.

26:47.701 --> 26:51.336
You executed a cop.

26:51.372 --> 26:53.839
Okay?

26:53.874 --> 26:58.377
You walk out of here,
your life is in danger.

26:58.429 --> 27:00.345
That's not a threat.

27:00.381 --> 27:02.414
That's a fact.

27:02.466 --> 27:05.851
I understand, Lieutenant.

27:05.886 --> 27:08.971

signs off,

Yeah, but at the end of the day,
where she ends up

At least, in the
back of your mind?

28:18.292 --> 28:21.460
Not in the back or in the front
or anywhere.

28:21.512 --> 28:23.211
Oh.

Two casualties in one generation

You put it that way...

I'm not saying, like,
it's a curse,

29:02.636 --> 29:05.703
it's just that I--
we, as cops--

29:05.756 --> 29:07.923
we carry a higher risk
of not coming home one day.

29:08.008 --> 29:09.257
A lot of cops
have kids, Eddie.

29:09.343 --> 29:11.643
I know.

29:11.678 --> 29:14.513
I never say never.

Well, the one he gave us when
we collared him was a phony,

so I had to do
some digging.

I'm not sure why we're sitting

- By telling him

to take someone down,

to answer to me.

31:11.682 --> 31:12.881
How'd you get
his address?

31:12.966 --> 31:14.216
CJA bail form.

31:14.301 --> 31:16.141
It's their ticket out
so they play it straight.

31:16.186 --> 31:18.186
- Pretty smart.
DANNY: Yeah, pretty smart.

31:18.272 --> 31:19.749
But we'll take it from here.
Good night.

31:19.773 --> 31:21.367
Yeah, I watched Rivers
case his next ATM.

31:21.391 --> 31:22.674
When he makes his
move tonight,

31:22.726 --> 31:24.392
I'm gonna be there
to nail his ass.

31:24.478 --> 31:25.538
No, you're not gonna be there,

31:25.562 --> 31:26.789
because it's our case,
not yours.

31:26.813 --> 31:28.947
I got the same authority
to go after Rivers as you.

31:28.982 --> 31:30.848
Difference is, I'm gonna
do it the right way.

31:31.151 --> 31:32.895
You're gonna back off,
or I'm gonna  <i>make</i> you back off.

31:32.919 --> 31:33.402
- Oh, really?
BAEZ: Stop it!

31:33.718 --> 31:34.652
- Come and make me back off!
- Yeah!

31:34.738 --> 31:36.182
BAEZ: Okay.
- I want to see you make me back off.

31:36.206 --> 31:37.600
I'll make you back up right now!
You gonna make me back off?

31:37.624 --> 31:38.957
Hey, stop it!

31:39.042 --> 31:41.292
This is about nailing Rivers,

31:41.378 --> 31:43.745
so just put 'em back
in your pants and listen.

31:44.998 --> 31:47.131
You're gonna need backup
to take this guy down.

31:47.217 --> 31:49.467
Yeah, maybe.

31:49.553 --> 31:50.780
And Anthony made Rivers'
next target,

31:50.804 --> 31:52.942
so he's gonna be
in charge of this one.

31:52.966 --> 31:54.966
(SCOFFS)

31:55.225 --> 31:56.474
Danny?

31:57.594 --> 31:59.511
Fine. Whatever.

31:59.596 --> 32:01.896
Great. Nice teamwork.

32:12.753 --> 32:14.703
(KEYPAD BEEPING)

32:23.177 --> 32:25.177
You got eyes on Rivers?

32:27.015 --> 32:27.899
BAEZ:
10-4.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.066
You're heading right for him.

32:38.409 --> 32:41.560
(PANTING)

32:41.612 --> 32:43.696
(GRUNTING)

32:44.782 --> 32:46.565
Give me your wallet!

32:46.617 --> 32:48.451
(GRUNTING)

32:48.536 --> 32:49.835
Remember me?

32:50.705 --> 32:53.539
(GRUNTING)

32:54.425 --> 32:55.624
DANNY:
Help me out!

32:55.710 --> 32:56.792
I'm gonna help.
Hell, yeah!

32:56.878 --> 32:57.793
Police!

32:57.879 --> 32:59.762
(GRUNTING)

32:59.847 --> 33:01.097
Hands behind your back!

33:01.182 --> 33:03.716
Ah. Son of a bitch!

33:03.768 --> 33:04.768
(BOTH GRUNT)

33:04.852 --> 33:06.769
Get him up!
Get him on his feet!

33:06.854 --> 33:08.788
You're under arrest.
Son of a bitch!

33:08.856 --> 33:10.272
- Get him out of here!
- Let's go.

33:10.358 --> 33:11.757
Yeah!

33:11.809 --> 33:13.109
(SNIFFLES)

33:13.194 --> 33:15.111
(GROANS)

33:16.197 --> 33:18.314
You okay?

33:18.399 --> 33:20.766
Yeah. What the hell
is in there?

33:20.818 --> 33:22.651
Smells like yesterday's fish.

33:22.737 --> 33:24.787
That coat's
probably had it.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.990
Think-think
that's funny, huh?

33:28.076 --> 33:29.992
Oh, I get it.
You picked this place

33:30.078 --> 33:32.244
'cause you knew
this trash would be here,

33:32.296 --> 33:33.612
and I'd end up like this, huh?

33:33.664 --> 33:36.749
Come on. You think a
dumb square badge like me

33:36.801 --> 33:39.451
could come up with
something like this?

33:39.504 --> 33:41.804
I guess I deserved it, huh?

33:41.889 --> 33:44.423
- Big time.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

33:44.475 --> 33:46.642
You were wrong to
screw with the line-up,

33:46.727 --> 33:49.845
but I respect how you stuck with
the case after it went south.

33:49.931 --> 33:51.847
You, too. Tell you what.

33:51.933 --> 33:53.432
How about we process
this jackass,

33:53.484 --> 33:55.300
and I'll buy you
a beer, okay?

33:55.353 --> 33:57.302
Only if you
take a shower.

33:57.355 --> 33:59.271
Okay, deal.

34:05.496 --> 34:07.446
- You went to see Terrence Dean?
- Yeah.

34:07.498 --> 34:09.165
Anything I need to know

34:09.250 --> 34:11.367
regarding possible fallout,
put it in a memo.

34:11.452 --> 34:13.452
Hang on, Garrett. Please.

34:15.172 --> 34:18.541
Look...
I'm sorry for what I said.

34:18.626 --> 34:21.326
- Hey, I'm getting used to it.
-Used to what?

34:21.379 --> 34:23.963
Whenever I offer my opinion
regarding police matters,

34:24.014 --> 34:26.348
you're the first
to remind me I'm not a cop.

34:26.434 --> 34:29.885
Well, look, the fact is,
you never walked a beat.

34:29.971 --> 34:31.887
It's also a fact
that you know nothing

34:31.973 --> 34:33.938
about handling
the New York City press corp.

34:33.975 --> 34:36.641
Do I dismiss
your suggestions out of hand?

34:36.694 --> 34:38.476
Actually, you kind of do.

34:39.614 --> 34:41.530
Okay, fair point.

34:44.318 --> 34:46.185
Do I make you feel like...

34:46.237 --> 34:48.404
you don't even belong
in the room?

34:48.489 --> 34:50.539
No. No, you don't.

34:50.625 --> 34:55.127
When Frank closes his door,
and it's just you, Baker and me,

34:55.163 --> 34:56.911
there's a reason
I'm in that room,

34:56.998 --> 34:59.381
and it's not just
to manage headlines.

34:59.467 --> 35:00.549
I get that.

35:00.635 --> 35:02.134
Do you?

35:02.170 --> 35:04.753
Frank wants an outside opinion.

35:04.839 --> 35:08.424
Someone who  <i>doesn't</i> live
in Copland 24/7.

35:08.509 --> 35:10.726
Someone who's not afraid
to speak up

35:10.811 --> 35:13.062
even when it crosses
that sacred blue line.

35:13.147 --> 35:14.787
Well, you've never been afraid
to do that.

35:14.849 --> 35:17.149
I may not know police procedure
chapter and verse,

35:17.185 --> 35:20.269
but I do know that you seeing
Terrence Dean was wrong.

35:20.354 --> 35:21.854
Tell that to the boss.

35:21.906 --> 35:23.405
- I already did.
- And?

35:23.491 --> 35:24.907
He disagreed... loudly.

35:26.077 --> 35:27.726
But he listened.

35:27.778 --> 35:30.529
That's all I'm asking for.

35:42.710 --> 35:43.737
I heard you're
looking for me.

35:43.761 --> 35:45.077
Yes, but I told your office

35:45.129 --> 35:46.411
I would come to you.

35:46.464 --> 35:48.464
I was in the neighborhood.

35:51.219 --> 35:53.185
(DOOR CLOSES)

35:55.056 --> 35:56.588
So?

35:56.641 --> 35:59.058
I decided not
to go to the mayor.

35:59.110 --> 36:02.261
Figured. I was just trying
to give you a way out.

36:02.313 --> 36:03.862
I know, and I appreciate it,

36:03.898 --> 36:06.282
but going behind my father's
back and playing politics--

36:06.367 --> 36:08.267
that's not who I am.

36:08.319 --> 36:09.768
You played me pretty good.

36:09.820 --> 36:11.120
That was not my intention.

36:13.157 --> 36:14.740
I got in over my head.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.742
So whatever you decide
to fire at me,

36:16.794 --> 36:18.744
please don't gut
the sex-trafficking law.

36:18.796 --> 36:20.329
You'd be hitting
the wrong target.

36:20.414 --> 36:21.780
I wouldn't.

36:21.832 --> 36:23.615
This is just
between you and me.

36:23.668 --> 36:25.117
- Okay.
- Well...

36:25.169 --> 36:27.803
you, me and your old man.

36:27.888 --> 36:30.339
My father didn't walk into this.
I pulled him in.

36:30.424 --> 36:33.142
Well, you got pull, all right.

36:33.227 --> 36:35.460
I sat down with him
this morning.

36:35.513 --> 36:37.313
We traded

36:37.398 --> 36:39.626
over a couple of points,
but he'll be standing next to me

36:39.650 --> 36:41.317
when I roll out
my crime bill next week.

36:42.436 --> 36:44.270
That's news to me.

36:44.322 --> 36:46.522
Maybe you're a better salesman
than you thought.

36:46.607 --> 36:47.990
And you and I?

36:48.075 --> 36:50.359
We're even.

36:50.444 --> 36:52.278
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

36:56.117 --> 36:57.366
Until the next time.

36:57.451 --> 36:59.251
There won't be a next time.

37:00.338 --> 37:02.288
Never say never.

37:18.055 --> 37:19.504
Hey.

37:19.557 --> 37:21.523
Thanks for coming...
45 minutes late.

37:21.609 --> 37:22.725
Ah, something came up.

37:22.810 --> 37:24.393
You ran the address,
and you found out

37:24.478 --> 37:26.845
it was a rescue shelter, and
you put two and two together?

37:26.897 --> 37:29.732
What I was actually doing
out in the real world

37:29.817 --> 37:31.317
is tracking down
Annie's grandmother,

37:31.369 --> 37:33.070
her next known legal
guardian of record.

37:33.071 --> 37:35.418
I spent hours doing that.
How did you find her?

37:35.442 --> 37:36.790
The phone number was right

37:36.791 --> 37:38.907
in the file, but the
area code was wrong.

37:38.993 --> 37:41.526
It... it took some time,
but she's on a train now,

37:41.579 --> 37:42.911
coming down to
pick her up.

37:42.997 --> 37:44.296
Oh.

37:44.332 --> 37:45.414
You're welcome.

37:45.499 --> 37:47.249
Thank you.

37:47.335 --> 37:49.051
Really. Thank you.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.053
(BARKING)

37:51.138 --> 37:53.205
We're not that couple,
are we?

37:53.257 --> 37:54.406
What couple?

37:54.492 --> 37:56.726
The kind that get a dog
as some kind of dry run

37:56.727 --> 37:58.193
for what kind of
parents they'd be like.

37:58.217 --> 37:59.729
No.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.013
Good.

38:01.065 --> 38:03.015
Never really made sense
to me anyway.

38:03.067 --> 38:07.903
With a dog, you can try out a
few, and you choose, and with...

38:07.988 --> 38:09.905
a baby, they just...

38:09.990 --> 38:12.574
hand you the one that's yours,

38:12.660 --> 38:16.245
and there's no refunds,
no returns.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.914
Never thought about it that way.

38:18.999 --> 38:21.917
You do it,
there's no going back.

38:23.037 --> 38:25.087
So what are we doing here?

38:25.172 --> 38:27.406
I'm letting you in
on a little secret.

38:27.458 --> 38:30.742
Um... I come here
once a month

38:30.795 --> 38:34.096
for a little unconditional love.

38:34.181 --> 38:35.681
(DISTANT BARKING)

38:35.716 --> 38:37.299
(LAUGHING):
Okay.

38:37.385 --> 38:38.917
But we're not
taking him home?

38:38.969 --> 38:41.586
Her. And no.

38:41.639 --> 38:43.922
I'm... I'm not ready

38:43.974 --> 38:45.858
for a full-time dog just yet.

38:47.228 --> 38:48.894
Unless you are.

38:48.946 --> 38:50.729
I could think about that.

38:52.233 --> 38:53.816
But only
if you're 100% on board.

38:53.901 --> 38:55.401
I like that.

38:55.453 --> 38:57.903
I think that's the way
we should think about stuff.

38:57.955 --> 38:59.321
Stuff?

38:59.407 --> 39:02.107
First house, a pet.

39:02.159 --> 39:04.293
A kid, everything.

39:04.378 --> 39:06.245
Always making sure
the other one

39:06.297 --> 39:08.247
is 100% on board.

39:08.299 --> 39:10.382
If we do that,

39:10.418 --> 39:14.420
I think there's no limit
to the life that we can build.

39:16.257 --> 39:18.173
You want to get up here?

39:18.259 --> 39:19.791
Get a little puppy love?

39:19.844 --> 39:21.593
Come on.

39:31.272 --> 39:33.856
Kind of hung me out
to dry there, Dad, didn't you?

39:33.941 --> 39:35.824
Your daughter's here,
Commissioner.

39:35.910 --> 39:38.110
So I hear. Thank you, Baker.

39:39.747 --> 39:41.363
(DOOR CLOSES)

39:42.583 --> 39:44.199
You carved me up

39:44.285 --> 39:45.617
over the governor's crime bill,

39:45.669 --> 39:47.230
and then you go out there
and support it?

39:47.254 --> 39:49.671
Well, it's a little
more complicated than that.

39:49.757 --> 39:51.011
I'm listening.

39:51.012 --> 39:52.962
No, you're not.
You're reloading.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.884
And not that I owe you
an explanation,

39:57.969 --> 40:00.186
but Mendez pulled back
on granting new powers

40:00.272 --> 40:01.888
to the state police.

40:01.973 --> 40:03.223
And why would he do that?

40:03.308 --> 40:05.642
Quid pro quo.

40:05.694 --> 40:08.027
He needs my support.

40:08.113 --> 40:11.064
And why didn't you suggest that
when I came to  <i>you</i> for support?

40:11.149 --> 40:14.534
Because when I make deals,
it's to advance the interests

40:14.619 --> 40:18.872
of the NYPD, not to bail
my children out of trouble.

40:20.458 --> 40:22.375
I guess I had that coming.

40:22.460 --> 40:24.694
And then some.

40:24.746 --> 40:27.330
So besides winning
a few concessions,

40:27.382 --> 40:30.083
how did you advance
the interests of the NYPD?

40:30.168 --> 40:32.502
That would be need-to-know.

40:32.554 --> 40:33.837
I need to know.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.843
Not to leave this room.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.761
But the parole board was set

40:41.847 --> 40:44.731
to release Mr. Dean
first thing Monday morning.

40:44.816 --> 40:47.183
That will no longer happen.

40:49.321 --> 40:52.388
The parole board is supposed
to be independent.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.859
And cop killers are supposed
to die in jail.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.945
Only if they were sentenced
to do so, and Dean wasn't.

40:59.030 --> 41:01.364
Oh, come on, Erin.
He got 25 to life,

41:01.416 --> 41:03.533
so parole is a judgment call.

41:03.585 --> 41:05.251
Yes, but not your judgment.

41:05.337 --> 41:08.588
No, but sound judgment...
by any measure.

41:12.844 --> 41:15.094
I'm just grateful
to be square with Mendez

41:15.180 --> 41:17.413
and off the hook for any favors.
