WEBVTT

00:40.415 --> 00:42.876
Julia! Julia!

01:35.011 --> 01:36.888
We did well today,
Simca and I.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.014
Lunch will be a feast.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.059
Oh, mmm,
do I dare to eat a peach?

01:41.142 --> 01:42.352
-Mm.
-Mmm.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.104
And I have something
for you too.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.439
A telegram.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.233
Oh, dear, is it good or bad?

01:48.316 --> 01:49.567
Yes.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.819
It is from "Life" magazine.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.445
Apparently we can't
put them off any longer.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.989
-It hasn't been that long.
-Nearly three months.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.783
They've offered us
a "take it or leave it" date

01:56.866 --> 01:58.618
for your interview,
and it is fast approaching.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.370
But no, you cannot go.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.205
Paul, what about your garden?

02:02.288 --> 02:03.540
Julia, you have to stay.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.959
My garden will be finished
and ready

02:06.042 --> 02:08.294
to be augmented when we return.

02:08.377 --> 02:12.716
Oh, now, we all knew
this day would come.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.844
Yes, Simca.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.804
We still have a book to write.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.015
And Judith will be here
in a few days.

02:20.098 --> 02:24.019
I've been a lotus eater all spring,
intoxicated by France.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.188
We've barely made any decisions
about Volume II.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.149
Lance could pull the plug
on our little project

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
if we don't get
our act together.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.028
We can make short work of it.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.280
We've agreed on
a dozen recipes in ten weeks.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.323
How can it possibly
be short work?

02:37.406 --> 02:39.743
Stop disagreeing with me.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.287
Well, it-it's good of you
to come visit us,

02:42.370 --> 02:43.997
uh, down here, Hal.

02:44.079 --> 02:48.793
It boosts morale to see
the CEO, uh, in the building,

02:48.877 --> 02:51.588
and we're all just as excited
about Julia.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.715
She's all over the country now.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.841
Pretty extraordinary.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.343
You're absolutely right.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.762
That "French Chef" of yours
is really something.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.223
And that's the problem.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.725
Eh, p-problem?

03:03.808 --> 03:05.101
My board was content
with nothing

03:05.185 --> 03:06.895
when all we had was nothing.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.271
But now that we have something,

03:08.355 --> 03:09.856
we want more something
and less nothing.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.816
Julia is something.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.318
In fact,
she's really something.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.903
I came down here
to let you know

03:14.986 --> 03:17.322
that nothing else on your
roster even comes close.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.324
You have a lot of nothing,
Hunter--

03:19.407 --> 03:20.700
a lot of nothing--

03:20.784 --> 03:22.786
and one something,
which makes all the nothing

03:22.869 --> 03:24.746
seem like even less
than nothing.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.998
And where is she, by the way?

03:27.082 --> 03:30.043
Uh, we don't know, exactly,

03:30.126 --> 03:32.671
or exactly when
she's coming back.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.589
But I can assure you
it'll be soon.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.552
Make us more something,
my friend.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.055
Or we'll start looking
for someone who can.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.270
Now, as you can see,
knitting is more than just

03:49.353 --> 03:50.855
sweaters and booties.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.400
There are endless
possibilities,

03:53.483 --> 03:57.195
like this knit breakfast
centerpiece.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.823
Oh, dear, I've been talking
so much, I've lost--

03:59.906 --> 04:02.075
I've lost count of my bacon.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.660
I need my glasses for this.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.161
Where are my glasses?

04:06.996 --> 04:09.666
Oh.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.751
I should've done fruit.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.838
Uh, gather the troops.
We need to have a talk.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.048
Is this about
your sister-in-law, sir?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.260
Because there's nothing
any of us can do.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.303
She can't knit under pressure.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.972
This is not about knitting.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.307
Well, a little bit,
but only indirectly.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.060
This is about you.
What can you do under pressure?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.562
Not knit.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.105
Not funny.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.107
Can you--can any of you--

04:34.190 --> 04:35.650
make a television show?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.402
And not just a television show,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.279
but a show that
people want to watch,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.031
not including
"The French Chef"?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.741
The evidence says no, sir.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.993
The time
for dilly-dallying is over.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.412
We need new content yesterday.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.080
Where is Russ, by the way?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.749
Stuck in a meeting about
his new weekly docuseries.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.335
Now, that's the kind of
initiative I'm talking about.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.463
And, Alice, I am disappointed.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.008
Our new programming for women--
women don't seem to care.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.135
Well, to be fair, sir,
"Why Not Knit?,"

05:02.218 --> 05:05.180
"Wake Up Calisthenics"--none
of those shows were my idea.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.474
That's hardly the point,
is it, Alice?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.309
Well, it's sort of
the point, Hunter.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.811
I always thought of you
as a team player, Alice.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.022
Well, I--
I pitched a travel show,

05:14.105 --> 05:15.899
a show about raising children,

05:15.982 --> 05:18.234
a show with a panel of doctors
talking about health,

05:18.318 --> 05:19.819
but you all rejected them.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.863
At some point,
you have to put me in the game.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.324
Enough with the metaphor,
Alice.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.451
I hired a new director
for "The French Chef."

05:26.534 --> 05:28.078
Okay, yes, that's true,

05:28.161 --> 05:30.497
someone to fill
Russ's size-11 shoes,

05:30.580 --> 05:32.290
maybe even take us up to a 12.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.832
Metaphorically.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.086
Amazing woman Alice found.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.338
-What's her name again?
-Elaine Levitch.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.464
Sounds Jewish.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.383
She worked at CBS
in Hollywood.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.009
Worked with Murrow, no less.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.761
-Murrow who?
-She sounds scary.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.930
Not only a woman,
but she's qualified too.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.599
I just hope she's finally
the dynamo we need

05:49.683 --> 05:51.685
to get things moving
around here.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.895
Well, Hunter,
I think that she and I--

05:53.978 --> 05:56.439
Oh, and fire
my sister-in-law,

05:56.523 --> 05:57.524
will you, Alice?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.025
Me?

05:59.109 --> 06:01.236
Well, out with the old,
in with the new, as they say.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.987
Hunter, Hunter,
you just told me

06:03.071 --> 06:04.614
I should be focused on the new.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.116
Make it quick.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.202
And be gentle,
as she's still family.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.334
There you are.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.752
Walk with you?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.379
Oh, did Hunter complain
that I was missing?

06:19.462 --> 06:22.090
He seems fully invested
in your new show, Russ.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.550
Okay, good.

06:23.633 --> 06:27.053
It's going very well, I think,
but it's-it's huge.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.972
It's like constructing
an ocean liner.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.349
It looks like a boat,
but you're not sure it floats.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.310
I'm used to having you
to bounce ideas off of.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.229
-Bounce away.
-Great.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.814
I got most of the episodes
worked out,

06:37.897 --> 06:39.941
I think--pollution
in the Boston Harbor,

06:40.025 --> 06:42.861
antiwar movement,
segregation in Boston schools--

06:42.944 --> 06:44.404
remind me to tell you
about that one.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.865
I'd love to hear about
civil rights, Russ, thank you.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.283
But are these
the right subjects?

06:48.366 --> 06:50.034
Which one should go first?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.328
Who's the host?
That's critical.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.122
Whoever that guy is
could make or break the show.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.373
Definitely.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.000
You're so good
at stuff like that.

06:57.082 --> 06:58.668
Russ, while you are
working on the details

06:58.752 --> 07:00.587
of this one show,
I'm tasked with saving

07:00.670 --> 07:02.088
the entire station.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.549
Who better to do that too?

07:04.632 --> 07:06.259
I will give it some thought.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.845
Drop the material on my desk.

07:08.928 --> 07:09.971
Thanks, pal.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.736
Alice Naman.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.488
So it is.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.491
Oh, Alice, it's so lovely
to hear your voice.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.159
Oh, Julia!

07:31.242 --> 07:32.744
Julia, the person
I most wanted to hear from

07:32.827 --> 07:34.120
in the whole world.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.538
Oh, then,
I have a feeling

07:35.622 --> 07:37.665
I'm going to make you
even happier.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.460
I'm coming home
in ten days' time.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.171
Ugh!
Oh, if you can make it nine.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.882
You have no idea what it's
been like here without you.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.760
I'm one girl in a sea of men.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.096
Julia,
we have so much work to do.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.764
Yes, it's a common theme.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.225
Yes, well, it turns out
I'm a little under the gun.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.396
And since we haven't really
spoken at all in the 72 days

07:59.479 --> 08:01.981
since you've been gone,
any tiny hints you can give me

08:02.065 --> 08:04.192
about what you're thinking
for season two.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.282
Alas, I have no hints.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.828
But I do promise
to return home very soon,

08:14.911 --> 08:19.040
refreshed and ready
to dive in.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.209
Okay, no pressure.

08:21.292 --> 08:25.755
I'd just like some hints
as soon as possible.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.386
I'm sorry I can't help you,
Paul,

08:32.470 --> 08:35.724
but even after two cognacs,
my back continues to spasm.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.850
Nonsense.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.019
This is my gift
to you and Simca.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.770
I wouldn't dream
of asking for a hand.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.981
How did it happen, by the way?

08:43.063 --> 08:44.524
It was very French.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.776
-You were writing poetry?
-In a way--

08:46.860 --> 08:47.944
making love.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.070
Oh.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.447
So humiliating.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.157
And Adele had no compassion.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.785
-Adele?
-My lover.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.870
What's worse?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.121
After it happened,
she ended it.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.581
Can you imagine?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.458
Just terrible,
with the injustice of it.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.751
Isn't it?

09:02.834 --> 09:06.087
My mistress
is a cruel mistress.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.050
Do you know, to be old like us,

09:10.133 --> 09:12.844
it is a God I don't believe
exists because joke.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.929
Speak for yourself.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.806
I do judo three times a week.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.891
Oh.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.810
I do lots of things
three times a week.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.790
What is it, ma chérie?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.167
More salt?

09:47.212 --> 09:50.590
If only it were
that simple, Simca.

09:52.717 --> 09:57.055
I need to share something
rather controversial with you.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.557
Now, my beautiful sister,

09:59.641 --> 10:04.312
I think it would be wise
to substitute chicken for goose,

10:04.396 --> 10:06.898
as I fear American women
just won't buy it.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.275
Then it wouldn't be
cassoulet.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.444
Well, that's a rather
narrow-minded stance.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.946
I will not publish a lie.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.198
Yes, but this is lunacy,
my darling.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.618
We have to make compromises.

10:18.702 --> 10:22.288
Judith gives extensive notes
in the best of times,

10:22.372 --> 10:24.958
but in the worst of times, ugh.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.668
She'll be here
before we know it.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.254
You want chicken, my chérie,
chicken it is.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.464
But I have a tiny suggestion,

10:31.548 --> 10:33.800
which is not to call it
cassoulet

10:33.883 --> 10:36.970
but to call it, uh,
French beans with chicken.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.581
She doesn't understand
American women.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.541
She doesn't know her audience.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.169
And I'm so tired
of making compromises

11:09.252 --> 11:10.795
to appease her, but...

11:12.505 --> 11:14.049
We are her guests.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.176
I thought
you'd made some progress.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.012
Ugh, barely.

11:19.095 --> 11:24.184
The truth is, in her bones,
she's not a teacher.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.311
Speaking of bones, Julia,
you'll never guess

11:26.394 --> 11:28.980
how Jean threw out his back.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.649
-Sex injury.
-Ooh.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.277
Well, I can only imagine
how he and Simca

11:34.361 --> 11:36.863
pretzel themselves
behind closed doors.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.783
Not Simca.

11:42.369 --> 11:47.123
You see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about--

11:48.583 --> 11:49.959
The French!

11:53.088 --> 11:55.965
Well, it's Gatsby,
isn't it, Russ?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.343
Jamison as
the poor boy obsessed

11:58.426 --> 12:00.470
with the unattainable woman.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.930
You found me out, Blanche.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.474
Which makes Virginia
Daisy Buchanan.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.477
When Lou Archer first
sees her, he describes her

12:07.560 --> 12:10.897
as having the, um--

12:10.980 --> 12:14.818
the beauty--the, um--
the beauty--

12:14.901 --> 12:17.112
Dead beauty of marble.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.322
For me, the question is, why?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.657
Making clear why.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.826
Is it out of, um--

12:22.909 --> 12:25.412
now, what did I write? Um.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.581
You say she traveled.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.375
Um...

12:30.458 --> 12:32.377
where--where is it?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.298
She traveled
too far too fast.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.676
Didn't you explain to me,
Blanche, that we needed

12:39.759 --> 12:42.429
to understand what
Archer understands,

12:42.512 --> 12:44.764
which is that
Virginia's aloofness

12:44.848 --> 12:47.934
is the result of trauma
and not of privilege?

12:48.018 --> 12:49.144
Yes, exactly.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.311
Her beauty makes us
misjudge her.

12:50.395 --> 12:54.232
I mean, she's not a statue,
a goddess in marble.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.651
She's not cold.
She's been burnt.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.241
Well, that's good.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.161
I'll, uh--I'll make that clear.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.537
Thank you, Blanche.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.499
It'll be great
having Julia back.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.126
I can't believe
how much I miss her.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.669
Oh, you're telling me.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.922
I went and got myself a job
last month for goodness' sake.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.175
What's it like being
around all that Harvard?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.844
Oh, yes, it can be a lot.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.680
I have a number of men
in my life now.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.515
Some of them are brilliant.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.225
A few are insufferable.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.519
One is adorable.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.189
And they're all
40 years younger than I am.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.777
Well, the men here
are just insufferable.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.530
I'd say on a scale
of 1 to 10,

13:42.614 --> 13:45.283
it's going very well.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.826
Extremely well.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.829
It's just--it's just--
it's a big responsibility.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.165
Taking on subjects
of this magnitude?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.209
I want to get it right.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.836
I'm counting on it.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.297
You have peanut butter...

14:02.509 --> 14:05.095
-Hey, pal. Avis?
-Hi.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.472
Just curious if you had
any names for me yet.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.224
It's been four hours, Russ.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.309
And I do have a few
other things on my plate.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.602
What's this about?

14:12.686 --> 14:13.895
My docuseries.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.022
Got a bunch of choices
to make--who should host,

14:16.106 --> 14:17.357
what I should start with.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.985
A professor I met
at Lowell House

14:21.069 --> 14:24.656
invited me to an antiwar
gathering tonight.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.824
Would that be any help?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.617
Are you kidding?

14:27.701 --> 14:29.786
Vietnam, that's in my top five.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.037
You don't mind?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.664
Well, I wasn't
going to go alone,

14:32.747 --> 14:34.790
but would you like
to be my date?

14:41.006 --> 14:43.216
Oh, good afternoon.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.676
Sleep well?

14:44.759 --> 14:47.887
I have a headache.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.305
Again?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.266
You should get that checked.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.435
It happens
when I go to bed upset.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.021
Oh, so I'm your headache.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.985
Julia, I don't want
to do this again.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.947
I don't want to waste
whatever time we have left.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.324
Yes, I agree.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.827
Fresh start.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.288
You started to cook
without me.

15:13.371 --> 15:17.334
Chicken and beans,
née cassoulet.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.127
And it happens to be delicious.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.429
Well?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.514
I'm adjusting
my expectations.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.143
It will do.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.021
Well, I'll take that.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.485
Now, get dressed.

15:43.568 --> 15:48.031
We have lunch at the restaurant
of Monsieur Paul Bocuse.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.574
I haven't had breakfast yet.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.620
Ah, Simca,
allow yourself to be dazzled

15:53.703 --> 15:56.664
by this wunderkind's cuisine.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.334
We'll use it as inspiration
to fall back in love

15:59.417 --> 16:01.336
with our little project.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.254
And also, I'm starving.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.387
Et voilà.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.013
Merci.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.183
-Welcome to Siberia.
-Oh.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.893
Paper tablecloths?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.520
What are we, children?

16:18.603 --> 16:20.146
Should we ask for crayons?

16:21.690 --> 16:23.233
Oh, Simca.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.200
Oh, fabulous!

16:32.283 --> 16:36.079
Oh, Simca, I think
it's looking at you.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.674
Oh, my crust.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.592
Oh. Oh, no.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.928
No.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.410
Oh, merci.

17:27.505 --> 17:31.259
All that theater
for a piece of steamed fish.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.394
Julia?

17:44.314 --> 17:45.648
Julia, what is it?

17:47.108 --> 17:48.860
Julia, what?

17:48.943 --> 17:50.028
Oh!

17:53.490 --> 17:55.992
I don't have the words.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.416
Really?

18:03.500 --> 18:06.002
For me, no cream,
no butter, no flavor.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.923
Oh, it's delicate,
light as a balloon,

18:10.006 --> 18:11.800
and entirely new.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.930
I feel like I'm a virgin
all over again.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.848
Well, I was until a moment ago.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.393
I've never tasted
anything like it.

18:21.476 --> 18:25.438
This is smoke and mirror
disguised as flavor.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.607
Well, I love it.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.567
Oh, la, la, love.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.987
If this is the future,
Julia, count me out.

18:33.071 --> 18:36.825
They call me the Lion
for my strength,

18:36.908 --> 18:41.413
the way I protected the men
who served under me.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.456
The Germans knew it too.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.875
They couldn't break me.

18:45.959 --> 18:50.296
In our youth, our hearts
were touched with fire.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.966
You felt it too?

18:53.049 --> 18:55.844
Well, I have periodic bouts
of heartburn.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.929
Yes, yes, I know what you mean.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.808
I wish I'd known you then.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.647
Julia?

19:07.731 --> 19:09.649
Gone to lunch already,
both of them.

19:09.733 --> 19:11.109
Right.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.610
Rock.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.280
And I'll be a lion.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.907
Oh!

19:17.991 --> 19:19.409
Merde!

19:19.492 --> 19:20.493
Wa--

19:22.537 --> 19:23.913
Parlez-vous anglais?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.582
Un peu.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.916
Oh, dear little old me,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.044
I don't seem to be able
to find the loo.

19:29.127 --> 19:33.173
It's, um--how you say,
through the door,

19:33.256 --> 19:34.966
down the stairs,
and to the right.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.510
Yes, now,
that is a loup too.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.818
Well, we ordered it too.
It was a showstopper.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.403
Chef Bocuse is an artist.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.956
Chef Bocuse always says
that the shallot

20:07.040 --> 20:08.750
is so much kinder
than the onion.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.877
Gosh, that's remarkable.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.768
Just thought I'd check in
before I call it a night.

20:29.688 --> 20:30.689
Better?

20:33.858 --> 20:35.652
This isn't working.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.778
No?

20:41.366 --> 20:43.743
I thought we did great today.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.328
You did.

20:47.163 --> 20:51.001
It's not always easy, I know.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.293
I'm doing my best.

20:53.545 --> 20:54.629
Well, do better.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.425
Okay.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.845
You need to write your notes
so I can read them.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.472
You embarrassed me
in front of one of our most

21:04.556 --> 21:06.850
important writers--
a genre writer, maybe--

21:06.933 --> 21:08.560
but you did it on purpose.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.478
You wanted to humiliate me.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.813
Now, you know
that's not true.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.940
I don't know
anything of the kind.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.235
Well, maybe a few days apart
will do us some good then.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.154
What are you talking about?

21:19.237 --> 21:20.822
France.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.908
I've told you several times.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.243
It's in your calendar.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.830
Well, nice of you to take
a holiday in my hour of need.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.123
It's not a holiday.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.624
Again, you know this.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.877
I'm visiting with Julia Child
and Simone Beck

21:33.960 --> 21:36.671
to see what progress has been
made on "Mastering" Part 2.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.465
You want that manuscript,
remember?

21:38.548 --> 21:40.216
So what will I do?

21:41.259 --> 21:42.469
It's just a few days.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.890
Just a few days.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.934
Why don't you just go then?

21:50.018 --> 21:52.062
Get out of here.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.106
Clearly, abandoning me
is the goal,

21:55.190 --> 21:58.818
so why don't you start now,
hmm?

22:02.697 --> 22:08.536
I know you think I'm some sort
of invalid, but...

22:09.996 --> 22:11.623
I did perfectly well

22:11.706 --> 22:13.375
before you came
into my life, Judith,

22:13.458 --> 22:14.668
and I have every intention

22:14.751 --> 22:18.129
of doing perfectly well
without you.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.890
I'll be back in a few days.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.768
And you have all
my information.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.313
Just holler if you need me.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.963
We are sliding
into a war in Vietnam.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.423
Thank you.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.591
We have to say no before
the war machine tells us

23:03.675 --> 23:06.636
they have no choice but to send
another boy to die tomorrow

23:06.720 --> 23:09.055
to give meaning
to the sacrifice of the boy

23:09.139 --> 23:10.390
they sent to die yesterday.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.476
No, I don't want a plaque
in Memorial Hall

23:13.560 --> 23:15.228
with names of my students on it.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.814
I want them to live
extraordinary lives,

23:17.897 --> 23:20.150
not die unnecessary deaths.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.529
He needs to be on my show.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.780
Well, then go get him.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.615
Look at me, I'm a producer.

23:27.699 --> 23:28.867
I'll give you full credit.

23:28.950 --> 23:31.953
Just meet me back here
in half an hour.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.247
Public television?
Brilliant.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.666
The movement has a message
but no way to reach people.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.959
I can help with that.

23:38.043 --> 23:39.419
The man who made
"The French Chef"?

23:39.502 --> 23:40.962
I should say so.

23:41.046 --> 23:43.214
I'd love to be on your program.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.424
I'm honored.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.510
I'm a little overwhelmed,
to be honest.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.972
This is
my first Harvard party.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.145
Stanley Lipschitz.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.230
No, actually, Avis DeVoto.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.857
And you are?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.734
Stanley Lipschitz.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.488
I've got somebody lined up

24:06.571 --> 24:09.366
from Students for a Democratic
Society, Todd Gitlin.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.700
You've done your homework.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.327
Says the professor.

24:15.705 --> 24:16.915
Special coffee?

24:16.998 --> 24:18.041
Lovely.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.251
Guess nothing about Harvard
is ordinary.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.295
You, uh, sure you want that?

24:22.379 --> 24:24.339
Caffeine has no effect on me.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.134
To Tim.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.552
To Tim.

24:32.889 --> 24:35.809
Who's Tim?

24:35.892 --> 24:37.977
I stayed away
from Harvard for years

24:38.061 --> 24:40.105
after my husband died.

24:40.188 --> 24:44.067
And then a few months ago,
I took a job at Lowell House

24:44.150 --> 24:48.363
just to be around all these
brilliant young people.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.323
They keep me on my toes too.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.658
In which department?

24:51.741 --> 24:53.076
Physics.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.453
Oh, a smarty pants
among smarty pants.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.663
Mm.

24:58.581 --> 25:02.961
And you, uh, still have time
for antiwar protests?

25:03.044 --> 25:04.963
Years ago, I worked
under a man

25:05.046 --> 25:08.049
named Hans Bethe at Los Alamos.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.884
You were on the
Manhattan Project.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.678
We were assigned
to create a formula

25:11.761 --> 25:14.931
for the explosive yield
of an atomic bomb.

25:16.349 --> 25:20.353
I've been a pacifist
since August 6, 1945.

25:26.026 --> 25:27.402
That's, uh--

25:31.114 --> 25:35.744
My sons narrowly avoided
the draft for World War II.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.328
-So.
-So.

25:37.412 --> 25:41.291
I'm here out of guilt,
and you're here out of love.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.375
Mm.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.133
Do you know that guy?

25:50.216 --> 25:51.926
Oh, no.

25:52.010 --> 25:55.013
I've never seen him before
in my life.

25:55.096 --> 25:56.681
Here.

25:56.765 --> 25:57.891
Blow.

26:01.603 --> 26:02.520
Mmm.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.481
It's rogan josh.

26:04.564 --> 26:08.485
It's heaven, Evan.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.820
It's because
you love food, Jude.

26:12.572 --> 26:15.450
I'm expressing my very good day
through this dish.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.118
Tell me.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.329
Finished the article
for "The New Yorker."

26:19.412 --> 26:20.747
Hoping you'll
read it over tonight.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.334
Of course.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.127
How was your day?

26:26.211 --> 26:29.089
If I had to express it
through food,

26:29.172 --> 26:31.758
it would be gruel.

26:31.841 --> 26:33.927
For grueling?

26:34.010 --> 26:37.055
It was a little sad.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.139
A little overwhelming.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.891
A little too much Blanche.

26:39.974 --> 26:43.311
Nothing I can't handle.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.437
How long till dinner?

26:44.521 --> 26:46.147
20 minutes.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.857
I'll go change.

26:47.941 --> 26:50.735
Maybe start thinking
about what to pack.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.380
Oh, shit.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.676
I give up!

27:14.759 --> 27:17.387
Judith?

27:17.470 --> 27:22.851
I dropped
my hat box on my head.

27:22.934 --> 27:23.893
Are you okay?

27:23.977 --> 27:25.186
My head is fine.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.105
It's a pretty light hat box.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.107
Okay, then--then what?

27:29.190 --> 27:31.609
I have so much to do.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.529
And I'm just one little person.

27:34.612 --> 27:37.532
Oh, well, forget about
reading my article.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.784
-It doesn't matter.
-Are you kidding?

27:39.868 --> 27:41.995
It's the one thing
I want to read!

27:43.955 --> 27:47.125
No, no, I can--
I can handle it--

27:47.208 --> 27:50.587
all of my work
and all of Blanche's.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.631
I can press another cookbook
out of Julia.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.760
-Yes, you can.
-Yes, I can.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.387
I can do it all, and I will.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.974
Let's have dinner.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.368
How'd it go with Prof?

28:21.451 --> 28:24.079
Shh, listen.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.543
Isn't it amazing?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.921
On--on Julia's set, yes,

28:33.004 --> 28:35.256
but this is a real sink.

28:35.340 --> 28:39.094
No, Avis, you're missing it.

28:39.177 --> 28:40.679
Oh, the beauty.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.847
Your friend is on a trip.

28:42.931 --> 28:44.516
One way or round?

28:44.599 --> 28:47.686
I'm a great guide.
He'll be okay.

28:50.605 --> 28:53.817
We got a male,
mid-to-late 30s, Caucasian.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.778
Said he was walking across
the Charles River to Boston.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.614
Yeah, another one of these
Harvard walk-on-water types.

28:59.698 --> 29:02.117
We're gonna bring him
to the station to sober up.

29:06.204 --> 29:08.456
I'm good at abstract things.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.668
Finding my keys, not so much.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.212
I sometimes forget
to appreciate

29:14.295 --> 29:15.797
things that are visible.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.842
Hence, a bachelor.

29:20.135 --> 29:24.264
Well, thank you for walking me
home, Professor Lipschitz.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.224
This was very nice.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.435
I thought so too.

29:28.518 --> 29:31.438
Maybe we could do it again?

29:31.521 --> 29:32.772
You sly dog.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.983
Did you have an agenda
for this stroll?

29:35.066 --> 29:37.152
Would anyone blame me?

29:39.195 --> 29:40.572
Oh.

29:45.076 --> 29:46.411
I saved you.

29:50.707 --> 29:51.791
Oh.

29:57.589 --> 29:59.257
Good night, Avis.

29:59.341 --> 30:02.260
I--oh.

30:15.357 --> 30:16.316
Get in.

30:16.399 --> 30:18.902
Thank you. I'm sorry.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.236
I brought you to the party,

30:20.320 --> 30:21.863
I'll take you home
from the party.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.490
That's how I was raised.

30:23.573 --> 30:25.075
No charges.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.451
It was an accident.

30:28.203 --> 30:29.496
LSD.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.665
No kidding.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.376
Huh.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.586
Not a word to anyone, please?

30:38.046 --> 30:40.882
I'm a producer and a spy.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.303
I had a good time.

30:45.387 --> 30:46.388
You?

30:49.349 --> 30:51.142
I did, yes.

30:53.478 --> 30:56.314
That waiter was putty
in my hands.

30:56.398 --> 31:00.485
Now it's up to us to manifest
the proper proportions,

31:00.568 --> 31:03.488
to meticulously recreate
something from memory.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.115
Very Proustian, I might add.

31:05.198 --> 31:06.616
Translated Proust
is not Proust.

31:06.700 --> 31:10.662
It is recipes like this that
will make the book relevant.

31:10.745 --> 31:12.205
Now you lost your mind.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.540
Yes, well, what if I have?

31:13.623 --> 31:16.751
Ah, let's take the time
to close our eyes

31:16.835 --> 31:18.878
and remember as we embark
on this great

31:18.962 --> 31:21.631
but potentially
perilous adventure.

31:23.008 --> 31:24.592
I'd rather take
a moment to forget.

31:24.676 --> 31:26.761
I stand by everything
I said yesterday.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.555
But this is ridiculous.

31:28.638 --> 31:30.390
Even for you.

31:30.473 --> 31:33.143
I see that hand-holding
isn't in the cards today.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.687
Should we just get on with it
and start with the brioche?

31:42.360 --> 31:45.488
Did I tell you about
when I liberated Paris?

31:45.572 --> 31:46.823
Oh, was that you?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.783
Oh, I have so many stories--

31:48.867 --> 31:51.119
a lifetime of stories.

31:51.202 --> 31:54.080
You were in the Far East
during the war.

31:54.164 --> 31:55.707
Your turn.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.752
You know I'm not allowed
to talk about that.

31:58.835 --> 32:02.005
What about the Foreign Service
after the war?

32:02.088 --> 32:04.382
That was nothing
compared to your stories.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.426
That cannot be a reply.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.970
We are in our twilight years.

32:09.054 --> 32:11.306
What do you have to show
for your life?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.643
I'd like to think
it's too soon to say.

32:20.398 --> 32:21.649
Oh!

32:30.158 --> 32:31.368
You've missed a spot.

32:46.383 --> 32:48.927
Hello, Albert.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.512
I've named him Albert.

32:50.595 --> 32:54.140
And now into the oven he goes.

32:55.475 --> 32:57.060
Poor thing.

33:02.315 --> 33:03.692
And now...

33:06.736 --> 33:07.737
We wait.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.951
I'm getting hungry.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.203
We could starve out here.

33:15.286 --> 33:16.996
All the lemonade is gone.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.166
You drank it all and knocked
over the bell in the process.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.879
-Julia!
-Simca!

33:24.963 --> 33:27.507
-Simca!
-Julia!

33:27.590 --> 33:30.010
-Julia!
-Simca!

33:30.093 --> 33:33.179
They'll be sorry when they
come out and find us dead.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.890
That's your fault.

33:35.974 --> 33:38.727
You should pull yourself up
and go save us.

33:40.895 --> 33:42.188
Okay.

33:45.525 --> 33:48.403
Voilà. Voilà.

33:48.486 --> 33:50.155
Some lion you are.

33:50.238 --> 33:52.032
Oh.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.158
Ah!

33:56.453 --> 33:57.537
Wait, wait, wait.

33:57.620 --> 33:58.955
Lean on me.

33:59.039 --> 34:01.875
And we'll be
each other's crutches.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.919
I can smell the food.

34:05.003 --> 34:06.588
It's good to have
industrious wives.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.089
Yes.

34:08.172 --> 34:11.676
And are we not still the men
they fell in love with?

34:15.722 --> 34:17.223
Hmm.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.808
Well, that's disappointing.

34:18.891 --> 34:22.062
More blob than fish.

34:22.145 --> 34:24.731
Hopefully the flavor
is there.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.067
Don't look at me.

34:27.150 --> 34:30.070
Well, I'll call the--
the boys.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.322
Oh, my fabulous invalid.

34:32.405 --> 34:33.697
How are you, my love?

34:33.782 --> 34:36.242
-Starving.
-Well, you're in luck.

34:36.326 --> 34:37.243
Ta-da!

34:37.327 --> 34:38.911
Ooh.

34:40.538 --> 34:43.833
Well, it doesn't look
quite as you described it.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.752
-It's a first attempt.
-Ah.

34:45.835 --> 34:49.880
Now, who would like
to go first?

34:49.964 --> 34:52.967
-You're our guest.
-But you're infirm.

34:53.051 --> 34:54.886
You can both taste it
together.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.059
It wasn't my idea.

35:19.744 --> 35:22.122
-Mm. Hmm.
-Mm.

35:25.917 --> 35:26.835
Making music?

35:26.918 --> 35:28.378
Trying to.

35:28.461 --> 35:30.422
How was your night with Avis?
Was it fun?

35:30.505 --> 35:32.424
Fun?

35:32.507 --> 35:34.634
Fun's not the right word, pal.

35:34.718 --> 35:37.887
I learned something last night.

35:37.971 --> 35:40.306
I am deeply connected
to the universe.

35:41.474 --> 35:44.060
Oh, that sounds fun to me.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.937
No, not fun.

35:48.148 --> 35:49.482
Vigorous.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.486
It was vigorous.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.822
Yeah, very enlightening.

35:55.905 --> 35:58.116
Well, I stayed late.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.493
I made a list
of some people for you.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.120
I think any of them
would be really exciting.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.998
No. No need. No need.

36:05.081 --> 36:06.082
Oh?

36:06.166 --> 36:08.710
Yeah, I found
the perfect host.

36:08.793 --> 36:12.255
Really? And who is that?

36:12.339 --> 36:14.007
Me.

36:14.090 --> 36:15.342
See you tomorrow, gentlemen.

36:15.425 --> 36:17.344
Remember to get me your budgets
by the end of the week.

36:17.427 --> 36:18.928
Elaine will be here
in ten minutes.

36:19.012 --> 36:21.639
Ah, a new chapter, fellas.

36:21.723 --> 36:23.767
"The French Chef"
is only the beginning.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.310
Of the end.

36:25.393 --> 36:27.520
I want everyone
on their best behavior.

36:27.604 --> 36:29.189
And bring her to my office,
will you, Alice?

36:29.272 --> 36:30.982
Of course, Hunter.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.442
Why are you smiling?

36:32.525 --> 36:34.903
We're an endangered species,
Ralph, old boy.

36:34.986 --> 36:37.572
We play golf
with the boss twice a month.

36:37.655 --> 36:39.032
We're fine.

36:39.115 --> 36:42.494
The winds of change smell
like Chanel No. 5, fellas.

36:42.577 --> 36:44.245
Mark my words.

36:44.329 --> 36:46.039
Why don't you all grow up?

36:46.122 --> 36:47.665
What?

36:47.749 --> 36:51.795
Nothing.
Just--watch your backs.

37:05.934 --> 37:08.561
I'm here for a cup of tea.

37:08.645 --> 37:10.814
What are you doing?

37:10.897 --> 37:12.649
Preparing.

37:12.732 --> 37:15.985
I will not be defeated
by a fish.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.238
Once more
unto the breach, Simca.

37:18.321 --> 37:19.447
Oh, no, no, no.

37:19.531 --> 37:20.949
You're not going to make
that dish again.

37:21.032 --> 37:21.991
Simca.

37:22.075 --> 37:23.576
Enough is enough!

37:23.660 --> 37:24.911
You're leaving in a week!

37:24.994 --> 37:26.287
Judith is here in three days.

37:26.371 --> 37:28.039
We can count
on our little fingers

37:28.123 --> 37:29.958
how many recipes
we've agreed on.

37:30.041 --> 37:32.293
And you're wasting
our time with that dish,

37:32.377 --> 37:33.545
and I don't know why.

37:33.628 --> 37:35.547
Because, Simca...

37:37.632 --> 37:39.884
Things change.

37:39.968 --> 37:41.636
No.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.722
They don't have to.

37:43.805 --> 37:47.100
Here, for example,
look around at this place

37:47.183 --> 37:48.935
you say you love.

37:49.019 --> 37:50.145
Why?

37:50.228 --> 37:53.565
Because it does not change.

37:53.648 --> 37:57.402
What out there is more
beautiful than this, ah?

37:57.485 --> 38:00.196
Well, nothing.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.157
But that's not what
we're trying to achieve.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.701
You're always chasing
something, Julia!

38:04.784 --> 38:07.287
Chasing what you say
Americans want.

38:07.370 --> 38:09.539
Chasing what that man cooks.

38:09.622 --> 38:11.583
Chasing fame!

38:11.666 --> 38:13.168
Stop chasing.

38:13.251 --> 38:16.338
We are who we are.

38:16.421 --> 38:18.548
This is not us.

38:18.631 --> 38:21.301
It's not even French.

38:21.384 --> 38:23.094
Enough with that dish.

38:23.178 --> 38:26.014
We start cooking
real food in the morning!

39:02.217 --> 39:04.803
Are we dinosaurs?

39:04.886 --> 39:06.971
Well, don't mock dinosaurs.

39:07.055 --> 39:10.475
They're in all
the best museums.

39:10.558 --> 39:12.227
For the first time
in my life,

39:12.310 --> 39:14.854
I feel like I might be
getting old.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.233
Not you.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.531
Simca's afraid.

39:24.614 --> 39:26.866
She and Jean both are.

39:26.950 --> 39:29.661
But you and I
have never been afraid.

39:29.744 --> 39:31.830
No, we haven't.

39:31.913 --> 39:34.791
The only way to stop
the world from passing you by

39:34.874 --> 39:37.794
is to do
what you've always done.

39:37.877 --> 39:39.087
What's that?

39:39.170 --> 39:41.423
Walk two steps ahead of it.

39:42.716 --> 39:44.050
So that's what we'll do.

39:44.134 --> 39:47.721
In the book, on the show,
with the fish.

39:47.804 --> 39:49.389
Gosh.

39:49.472 --> 39:52.517
Oh, Paul, it's so nice
working with you.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.436
You always agree with me.

39:54.519 --> 39:56.146
Well, you're always right.

39:59.232 --> 40:02.736
Jean asked me earlier
what I had to show

40:02.819 --> 40:05.989
for my life in its twilight.

40:06.072 --> 40:08.533
And I didn't give him
the right answer.

40:08.616 --> 40:10.493
And what's that?

40:10.577 --> 40:12.037
My marriage.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.791
Oh, Paul.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.170
Oh, Paul.

40:20.253 --> 40:21.796
Mm! Mm, sorry.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.590
Mm, mm. Careful, careful.

40:23.673 --> 40:25.258
Come on.

40:25.342 --> 40:26.426
Oh, come here.

40:26.509 --> 40:27.635
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.304
Ooh! Ooh!

40:29.387 --> 40:31.222
Ooh.

40:31.306 --> 40:32.474
Ooh!

40:32.557 --> 40:35.643
Ooh, good as new.

40:37.228 --> 40:39.189
Oh, how fabulous.
