NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:05.130 --> 00:08.550
(crowd cheering)

00:08.842 --> 00:12.595
-Captain, if there's cops on the take--
-One step at a time.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.514
Officers! Everybody, hands on the table!

00:14.597 --> 00:16.266
-(overlapping dialogues)
-Up against the wall.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.394
The guilty verdicts are
against reason, insupportable,

00:19.477 --> 00:21.771
-and I hereby vacate them.
-(gavel pounds)

00:21.855 --> 00:24.190
The eyewitnesses were weak,
but their testimony was sound.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.735
You're talking about a judge
with an impeccable service record.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.361
That was my car back there!

00:28.445 --> 00:29.988
Well, you shouldn't have been
parked in a handicapped zone!

00:30.071 --> 00:31.156
You got what you deserved, buddy.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.950
Oh, yeah?
Well, you take a look at this, buddy!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.577
You are under arrest!

00:36.828 --> 00:39.831
Are we gonna do this double-parked,
or are you gonna come inside?

00:42.625 --> 00:44.794
-Whoa.
-Because I'm in a wheelchair,

00:44.878 --> 00:45.962
you think you can handle me?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.465
Well, if I can't,
I'll find six cops who can.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.508
Mr. Seltzer's in the market for a trade.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.760
A security fund.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.096
-Which contains?
-A lot of voices. A lot of conversations.

00:55.180 --> 00:59.392
SELTZER: <i>Badge number 1146,</i>
<i>patrolman H. Hunter,</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:01.603
<i>payoff for Douglas and Caulley.</i>

01:01.686 --> 01:02.604
You're on tape three times.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.606
It's all pretty much
the same conversation.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.024
(gun cocks)

01:08.943 --> 01:10.779
(chanting) Bobby! Bobby!

01:10.862 --> 01:12.489
Bobby! Bobby!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.617
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

01:15.700 --> 01:17.619
Yesterday you said
you wanted to try being a gimp.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.870
What, did you change your mind already?

01:18.953 --> 01:20.246
You can't come with me, Gerry.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.499
Did we ruin a perfectly
good relationship, or what?

01:22.582 --> 01:23.792
You know better than that.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.293
I called you twice.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.670
I waited all day for you
to return my calls.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.257
Look familiar to you?
County courthouse. Man, that's Judge Cole.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.675
J.D.: This is too sweet.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.720
This could go anyplace.
This could reach into my own office.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.263
It scares me not knowing who to trust.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.224
We could start with each other, Irwin.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.518
Instead, all night
I get these phone calls.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.187
-They tell me I'm a dead man.
-Ben, I have to know what you've got.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.190
It's what you've got.
You got a rotten department.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.319
(indistinct chattering)

01:51.402 --> 01:56.157
Item six, lookout continues for Honky,
the guard goose,

01:56.783 --> 01:59.410
now in hour 38 of disappearance.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.248
Testimony from afflicted grocers
at the Decca markets

02:03.331 --> 02:04.958
and an early-morning fracas

02:05.041 --> 02:08.294
that sent one German Shepherd
to the neighborhood vet

02:08.378 --> 02:11.256
indicates that said gander continues

02:11.339 --> 02:15.301
in its wanton and conscienceless orgy

02:15.593 --> 02:17.220
of fowl play.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.972
(quacking)

02:19.055 --> 02:21.307
ESTERHAUS: That goose is out there, folks.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.642
Let's get him!

02:22.725 --> 02:25.812
(quacking)

02:25.895 --> 02:27.605
All right, item seven,

02:27.689 --> 02:29.941
Detective Belker
commences undercover today

02:30.024 --> 02:32.527
as one of our city's disabled citizens.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.862
MAN: That's a fact.

02:34.612 --> 02:39.242
Mick's wheelchair will be circulating
approximate to banks in the area

02:39.325 --> 02:43.454
bounded by Elmwood, North Delaware,
and Sumner Streets.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.166
Nature of the undercover
commends area patrols

02:46.249 --> 02:48.751
to particular alertness for backup.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.253
All right, item eight,

02:51.045 --> 02:54.048
Robert Hill enters the squared circle
this evening

02:54.132 --> 02:58.136
for what he claims
will be his fistic swan song.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.305
MAN: Yeah. Yeah.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.557
ESTERHAUS: 8:30 sharp at East Street Gym.

03:02.974 --> 03:07.562
Now, Bobby tangles
with vice's Dwight "Butt-Ugly" Stafford...

03:07.645 --> 03:09.397
-Yeah!
-Get him, Bobby!

03:09.480 --> 03:10.315
Oh!

03:10.398 --> 03:13.318
ESTERHAUS:
...Brower department's middleweight crown.

03:13.401 --> 03:17.363
Tickets at Morrisey's
or via Officer Schnitz.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.281
Now, let's remember,

03:18.364 --> 03:21.201
the proceeds resuscitate
the PAL boxing program.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.453
They're gonna have
to resuscitate Dwight Stafford

03:23.536 --> 03:25.580
when Bobby gets finished
tattooing his noggin.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.999
MAN: Yeah!

03:28.082 --> 03:31.920
You will root for both
seafarer's safe return to port,

03:32.003 --> 03:38.343
and secondarily,
that Hill cleans Stafford's clock.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.637
(cheers and applause)

03:40.720 --> 03:42.222
WOMAN: Get him, Bobby!

03:42.305 --> 03:45.934
Item last, a continuing reminder

03:46.351 --> 03:48.519
that betting with bookies
over the next fortnight

03:48.603 --> 03:52.774
is not only fiscally imprudent,
it can buy you a bust.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.903
Now, all betting, till otherwise advised,
should be mano a mano.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.655
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.782
And hey, hey!

04:02.659 --> 04:04.953
-Let's be careful out there.
-(all cheer)

04:05.036 --> 04:07.914
(chanting) Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

04:07.997 --> 04:09.916
Bobby! Bobby!

04:09.999 --> 04:13.086
Bobby's bad! Bobby's bad
when he gets mad! He's superbad!

04:13.169 --> 04:15.546
-Superbad! Superbad!
-Hey, easy, easy.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.464
Hey, Bobby.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.675
Hey, Luce, no jokes, please.
I'm in a lot of pain.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.886
No jokes. I just wanted to tell you
how good you looked last night.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.013
-Oh, thanks.
-You got me seven, too.

04:24.097 --> 04:24.931
My pleasure.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.934
So now, uh, what should we do?
Should we lean, or should we back off?

04:28.017 --> 04:30.812
Yeah, come on, Bobby. Vice is already
calling about action for tonight.

04:30.895 --> 04:34.565
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Right now, I'd make me even money to live.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.236
Hey, supercop! Hey, nice fight.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.571
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:40.655 --> 04:41.948
(whooping)

04:44.117 --> 04:46.911
-Are we ready?
-Ready for what?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.247
Yesterday you said
you wanted to try being a gimp.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.416
-What, you change your mind already?
-No, no.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.585
Okay, then. Let's go.
Where's your chair, hotshot?

04:54.669 --> 04:56.004
You can't come with me, Gerry.

04:56.087 --> 05:00.216
Hey, we got it rotten enough out there
without some amateur giving us a bad name.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.761
-They won't allow it. You could get hurt.
-Oh, now that'd be terrible, wouldn't it?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.847
I might have to spend the
rest of my life in a wheelchair.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.183
-I'm sorry.
-HOWARD: Detective...

05:09.892 --> 05:13.396
-I require a word with you.
-Sure, Lieutenant.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.983
-You okay?
-No, I am not.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.778
I was about to assist two uniforms
in an off-duty arrest last night

05:20.862 --> 05:24.407
when I discovered that my service revolver
was loaded with blank cartridges.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.326
I don't know what you mean.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.121
My inference
is that you had access to my gun

05:30.204 --> 05:31.622
while I was in the shower yesterday,

05:31.706 --> 05:34.375
and you replaced my live ammunition
with blanks.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.419
Let me get this straight.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.505
You're mad because I kept you
from killing yourself?

05:40.923 --> 05:43.634
The only thing that you kept me
from doing, Detective,

05:43.718 --> 05:45.386
was bringing down a felon.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.307
Oh, yeah?
What do you want to tell me about that?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.393
What, the phone rang,
you got mixed up and answered the iron?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.562
Lieutenant, I think you ought
to go talk to the captain.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.732
You have no right to touch
another officer's equipment.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.403
You and I have nothing further to discuss.
Good day.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.656
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

06:05.740 --> 06:07.408
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:07.492 --> 06:11.245
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:11.329 --> 06:13.039
(sirens wailing)

06:18.503 --> 06:22.423
(theme music playing)

07:53.806 --> 07:56.767
-Captain, Irv Luboff.
-I thought we did business yesterday.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.478
I've got a worried client here, Mr.--

07:58.853 --> 08:00.897
I wouldn't try bait-and-switch
if I were you, Ben.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.816
We've copied your tapes and have
your signed authorization to use them.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.152
Look at me, Captain.
Nobody's trying to pull anything.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.237
We gotta talk.
You got to get me a better deal.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.572
In exchange for what?

08:11.282 --> 08:13.618
I'll give you something in exchange.
Please, Captain.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.205
Neal, J.D.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.421
BEN: They should have known
I was stand-up.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.882
They should have known
Ben Seltzer was a right guy.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.176
Instead, all night,
I get these phone calls.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.553
-They tell me I'm a dead man.
-Who does?

08:33.763 --> 08:36.432
Promise me, get me relocation,
then I'll tell you.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.392
Ben, we have to know what you've got.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.395
It's what you've got.
You got a rotten department.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.815
You got a whole division on the take,
and then they're gonna kill people?

08:45.983 --> 08:47.610
You back that up,
and you'll have your deal.

08:47.693 --> 08:48.528
Oh, I'll back it up.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.281
You just keep me alive,
and not with no vice cops.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.910
Ben, I think a stipulation to terms
might be appropriate here.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.036
I have to see something on the table.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.331
Ben, I wouldn't give fact one
unless we have some guarantee--

09:01.749 --> 09:02.625
You want a start?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
-Little Switzerland.
-LAWYER: Ben, shut up.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.254
BEN: The lockers
at the 119th Street depot.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.131
-There's more payoffs there than a bank!
-Shut up.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.386
I want this agreement guaranteed
by your chief and the DA's office.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.263
-Work it out.
-You'll recommend?

09:16.305 --> 09:19.058
If he'll deliver. You want him protected?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.518
Ben's indicated that he has some--

09:20.601 --> 09:23.729
Go try and sell a business
like mine with a police escort.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.108
End of business latest.
I want him out of the cold.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.235
Let's go. Ben.

09:29.986 --> 09:30.820
Yeah.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.744
Think he's dealing in the street, Captain?

09:39.912 --> 09:42.623
Put a tag on Seltzer.
I don't want him out of our sight.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.459
Stake out the lockers
at the 119th Street depot.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.337
Continue a surveillance
by camera until I take it off.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.255
Got it.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.387
Uh, Captain...

09:58.639 --> 10:00.600
Have you, uh, seen
Lieutenant Hunter today?

10:00.683 --> 10:01.726
No. Why?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.228
Okay, now, he swears I'm wrong,
but I don't buy it.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.315
I think he put a gun
to his head last night.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.983
I think he tried to kill himself.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.195
If that's true, J.D.,
I need to hear everything you know.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.282
The guy was in such bad shape.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.285
I didn't want to take a chance,
so I put some blanks into his gun.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.330
Now, he comes in today
with some cockamamie story

10:22.413 --> 10:24.540
and a bandage about that big
on the side of his head.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.875
Why didn't you tell me this yesterday?

10:25.958 --> 10:28.002
You don't say something
like that on just a hunch.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.922
But, Captain, the guy's out on a ledge.
You got to talk to him; now.

10:33.549 --> 10:37.303
-Ray, where's Howard?
-Sniper call, Oak Street.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.182
Henry, Henry, take a ride with me.

10:43.559 --> 10:46.771
Blue Fox One, have you got access
on a second set of stairs?

10:46.854 --> 10:49.982
MAN: <i>Blue Fox One to Fox Leader.</i>
<i>Negative on the second stairs.</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:54.320
Blue Fox One, continue to reconnoiter.

10:55.279 --> 10:58.574
-MAN: <i>Roger, Blue Fox Leader.</i>
-Howard, can I speak to you for a minute?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.284
-Now, Frank?
-Henry will fill in.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.829
All right, give the lieutenant a read
on the position.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.082
Okay, Lieutenant, we got a lone gunman,

11:06.165 --> 11:08.334
last window on the left corner
of the building.

11:08.959 --> 11:12.046
Howard, I just had a talk with J.D.,
and I'm concerned

11:12.129 --> 11:14.548
it may not be appropriate
for you to be out here.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.344
-Now, just a minute, Frank.
-J.D. thinks you tried to kill yourself.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.096
-That's nonsense.
-What's that?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.390
That's a household mishap.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.600
Or a powder burn.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.521
Frank, I am fully able to meet
my professional responsibilities.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.523
MAN: <i>Blue Fox One to Fox Leader.</i>

11:30.606 --> 11:33.526
<i>We've got a dumbwaiter shaft</i>
<i>we're clear to access.</i>

11:33.609 --> 11:35.069
HOWARD: Fox Leader. Fox Leader.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.113
Can you take him without injury?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.740
<i>High probability</i>
<i>if we can distract him, sir.</i>

11:39.824 --> 11:42.034
All right, Blue Fox,
I want you to prepare for tear gas.

11:42.118 --> 11:42.952
Stand by.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.163
Ballantine, prepare to deploy tear gas
on my command.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.124
Blue Fox One to Fox Leader.

11:48.207 --> 11:52.670
I want you to move in on him on two counts
after the tear gas goes in.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.547
-Do you copy?
-MAN: <i>Affirmative.</i>

11:54.922 --> 11:56.966
-Are you prepared?
<i>-Affirmative.</i>

11:57.425 --> 11:58.426
Stand by.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.262
-You ready, Ballantine?
-Yes, sir.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.141
Now.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.353
(glass shatters)

12:10.479 --> 12:12.022
Backup positions, let's move!

12:12.106 --> 12:13.733
MAN: <i>Got him, sir.</i>

12:13.816 --> 12:15.401
Any further questions?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.279
See me at the station.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.656
(siren wailing)

12:27.037 --> 12:29.248
Oh! I'm sorry, lady.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.919
(groans)

12:40.885 --> 12:42.094
(breathing heavily)

12:50.728 --> 12:53.022
(growling)

13:09.872 --> 13:11.957
-What do you think you're doing, huh?
-Hey!

13:12.041 --> 13:14.835
-Are you following me?
-I saw what's been going on!

13:14.919 --> 13:17.630
Every curb you come to,
you get out and lift the chair over.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.674
-That's good. That's authentic.
-Stop following me.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.092
Who says I'm following anybody?

13:22.176 --> 13:23.677
I got just as much right
to be on the street as you do.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.055
Not when you're interfering
with police business, you don't,

13:26.138 --> 13:27.556
so you turn it around and beat it.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.517
Oh, what are you gonna do, bust me again?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.684
You got it.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.522
Hey! Hey!

13:34.605 --> 13:36.315
You know what your mistake is, man?

13:36.774 --> 13:38.984
You think it's just a guy in a wheelchair.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.738
Well, it ain't.
I mean, it's an attitude, man.

13:44.073 --> 13:48.077
It's a way of life!
Look at you. You're standing up.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.877
(scoffs)

13:58.295 --> 14:01.090
It's just like I said, man, no soul.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.070
Hey, excuse me, would you tell Jimmy

14:23.153 --> 14:25.281
that Bobby Hill's here
to pick up his tickets?

14:26.031 --> 14:29.326
Hey, Bobby Hill, I saw you won your fight.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.830
-Come on. I got your number.
-How you doing, Bobby?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.707
Hey, did you get your mouthpiece?

14:35.457 --> 14:40.504
Yeah, well, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

14:40.588 --> 14:44.633
And, uh, no, Steve,
I ain't got the mouthpiece yet.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.551
Andy.

14:45.634 --> 14:49.722
See, Andy, I got this problem

14:49.805 --> 14:52.850
in that I had to spend some of the 20,

14:52.933 --> 14:55.769
which I appreciated you gave to me.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.146
Forget about it.

14:58.439 --> 15:03.235
'Cause, I got my first fight Saturday.
I could pay you back after that.

15:03.319 --> 15:08.866
So, I was wondering maybe
if I could borrow a few more.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.576
No. No way.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.038
Oh.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.165
Okay.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.672
Well, thanks anyway.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.425
Hey, uh, here you go, Bobby.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.552
Your people want ringside,
you got to come early.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.931
-Okay, thanks.
-Wrong Bobby, numskull.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.891
Good. Right.

15:33.974 --> 15:37.937
Uh... I'll see you guys.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.941
-Has he really got a fight?
-Shields? Sure, he does.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.485
Bill him "Irish,"
put him in with a black guy,

15:44.568 --> 15:45.986
he'll do some business.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.823
-He got a future?
-You wanna know what his future is?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.160
He gets flattened twice,
pockets a little change,

15:53.243 --> 15:55.329
commission takes away his license.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.790
Then he moves to another state,
puts "Irish" in front of another name,

15:57.873 --> 15:59.291
and he gets knocked out some more.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.921
The future for him is drooling into a cup
and stroking out at 50.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.006
Teach your kids hockey.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.342
They'll live longer.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.470
Let's go, Steve.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.642
J.D.: Hey.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.311
There's a suspicious-looking
character if I ever saw one.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.564
-Get a picture.
-Nah, I'm down to my last two shots, babe.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.608
Hey, come on.
Who's to say she's not the chief trigger

16:24.692 --> 16:27.194
for some crazed
female assassination group?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.114
Man, she could murder me.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.493
-(sighs)
-Man, I just can't believe it.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.747
-What?
-Hunter trying to do himself in.

16:39.456 --> 16:44.378
-That's the last cat I would have thought.
-Neal, a guy that's wrapped that tight,

16:44.461 --> 16:47.756
he pops a mainspring, the only thing
he's thinking is to eat his piece.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.052
-Look at Hogan in South Ferry.
-Yeah.

16:53.095 --> 16:57.182
-Kimball in Castle Heights.
-Manowitz.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.352
Baker did it with an Italian number,
.7 millimeter.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.062
Sanky.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.189
Yeah, he took poison.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.401
Hey, what about Pepitone?

17:08.360 --> 17:12.114
He smoked it... same as Appleson.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.616
Benedetto.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.412
Man, it must feel good,
something like that.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.040
I mean, stopping a suicide.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.542
You ought to know, pal.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.878
You did it enough times for me.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.547
-NEAL: Hey.
-J.D.: Hmm?

17:28.630 --> 17:29.798
You see that guy over there?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.676
WOMAN (on PA): <i>...and Omaha</i>
<i>is now ready for boarding...</i>

17:32.760 --> 17:34.344
-Mm-hmm.
-(camera shutter clicks)

17:34.428 --> 17:37.556
-Look familiar to you?
-Yeah, I don't know.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.604
County courthouse, man, that's Judge Cole.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.483
Oh, no. This is too sweet.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.193
WOMAN (on PA):
<i>Will passengers with tickets</i>

17:49.276 --> 17:50.944
<i>please check their luggage at the gate?</i>

17:52.279 --> 17:55.115
-Uh, let's take it real easy, bro.
-Yeah, but let's take it.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.284
WOMAN (on PA): <i>Final call for bus 91.</i>

18:02.122 --> 18:05.167
LUCY: What's he doing back there?
Joe, get him up, would you?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.877
Come on, kid.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.837
You can do 60 miles
an hour on a city street,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.339
you can sit up straight.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.216
It's this vinyl, man.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.176
Have you ever looked
at this vinyl back here?

18:14.259 --> 18:16.678
It's got-- It's got, like, these holes,

18:16.762 --> 18:18.514
like craters on the moon, you know?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.307
Like craters on the moon
with little holes,

18:20.390 --> 18:22.768
and inside there's, like, these shadows.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.729
Behind the shadows, there's, like,
these little things with torches,

18:25.813 --> 18:27.773
like little people
with torches trying to signal us.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.110
You see what drugs do to your brain?
You're talking like a crazy man.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.655
Joe, there's a goose over there attacking
a vegetable stand.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.954
All right, you stay put.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.249
You see that ashtray?
Keep your eyes on that ashtray.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.044
Don't get out of the car, you understand?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.713
MAN: Get out of here, you dumb bird!

18:51.797 --> 18:53.048
(goose honking)

18:53.132 --> 18:55.217
Officers, officers, come here,
will you please?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.301
Got to be honky, huh?

18:56.385 --> 18:58.804
MAN: Please, officers,
there's a bird here. Look at this thing.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.305
I can see it, sir!

19:00.389 --> 19:01.849
-MAN: It's all over my vegetables!
-I see that.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.685
Calm down. We'll take care of it.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.812
-All right.
-Cuff him, Luce.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.816
-That's cute.
-How do you want to do this?

19:10.899 --> 19:12.067
(honks)

19:12.860 --> 19:15.988
-I'll, uh, I'll just go for--
-(honks)

19:16.405 --> 19:19.074
I'll go low,
and you just go high, that's all.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.909
-Just...
-All right.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.329
Take it easy. Hi. Hi. Hi, honky.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.665
I'll count to three, and then we'll do it.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.250
Yeah, that's good.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.335
All right.

19:31.461 --> 19:35.507
-One... two... three.
-(squawks)

19:35.591 --> 19:37.259
(honking)

19:41.346 --> 19:44.183
Grab that thing. Walk! Look out! Joe!

19:44.975 --> 19:48.478
-LEO: Honky the guard goose, right?
-Oh, he told me his name was Chuck.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.981
-Must have been a hell of a fight.
-Yeah, that part didn't work out.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.734
We had to feed him
animal tranquilizer on a lettuce leaf.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.319
Where'd you get animal tranquilizer?

19:55.402 --> 19:56.445
Right here.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.281
This kid was going 60
down Utica in a spaceship,

19:59.364 --> 20:00.824
if you know what I mean.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.618
I think Honky ate half the evidence.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.827
-Hey. Hey.
-Leo.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.079
Ah, B cell is empty.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.333
-Give him a pan of water.
-I'm gonna clean the kid up.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.084
They had to share the back of the unit.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.504
(honking)

20:21.929 --> 20:24.973
Oh, Captain,
we have something to show you.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.600
Here, get a load of these.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.019
Judge Cole?

20:29.102 --> 20:31.355
Yeah, opened up the locker
like it was the front door to his house.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.690
-Mm-hmm. Bag was kinda hefty, too.
-You trail him?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.109
Back to the courthouse,
took the bag inside with him.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.071
Now, we nail Heyser on a manslaughter rap,
Cole vacates the verdict.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.614
What do you want to bet
there's money in that bag,

20:40.697 --> 20:41.907
and it's coming from Heyser?

20:41.990 --> 20:43.867
Nothing to say he wasn't
picking up his gym shorts.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.745
We have to get him on tape.
I want to get a look at that bag, too.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.455
All right, how 'bout we plant
somebody on his calendar

20:48.538 --> 20:49.790
and see if he bites on a bribe?

20:49.873 --> 20:51.792
Choreograph with the DA's office
for this afternoon.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.669
-Let's see if we can avoid an entrapment.
-Okay.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.920
Excuse us, gentlemen.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.970
All right, what's this bookie Seltzer got

21:03.053 --> 21:04.972
that's worth our giving him
relocation, Frank?

21:05.055 --> 21:08.892
He claims he can substantiate
widespread corruption.

21:08.976 --> 21:09.810
Can he?

21:09.893 --> 21:12.729
The tapes he gave us yesterday
were as advertised.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.982
I understood they were also antique.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.736
He gave us a drop location for payoffs
which turned up Judge Milton Cole.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.531
"Heads'll Roll" Cole?

21:23.615 --> 21:26.743
We're sending LaRue in this afternoon
to see if he'll take a bribe.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.162
LaRue will be wired?

21:30.747 --> 21:31.790
Good for you.

21:32.249 --> 21:36.712
Seltzer also claims that Midtown Vice
is completely compromised.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.300
Let's follow it out, Frank,
wherever it goes.

21:41.383 --> 21:45.262
I intend to. Having said which,
I have a favor to ask.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.973
Sounds to me like you got one coming.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.560
It's about Howard Hunter.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.814
He's on some of Seltzer's tapes
from 15 years ago.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.860
-Was he on the take?
-He was a bag man. He never took a cent.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.986
What do you need, Frank?

22:01.069 --> 22:03.572
If he could be spared an IAD hearing.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.700
-I'll take care of it.
-Thank you.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.535
Full-bore on the rest of it, Frank.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.662
Full-bore.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.543
Occur to you whose precinct that was?

22:17.919 --> 22:18.795
Yes.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.548
Commander Cleveland of Midtown.

22:22.299 --> 22:26.887
Wouldn't that be something, Frank,
if Ozzie got tarred with this brush?

22:26.970 --> 22:29.264
I think the whole department
would be tarred.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.516
I don't think there'd be
any winners, Chief.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.435
You're right.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.604
Keep me posted, Frank.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.542
Hey! Hey!

22:59.419 --> 23:00.420
(horn honking)

23:00.921 --> 23:03.924
-I got it, Mick!
-(horns honking)

23:04.716 --> 23:08.220
You are caught, dog breath!
Give me that money! Get up!

23:14.851 --> 23:17.771
He came out from between the cars.
I didn't have a chance to stop.

23:18.438 --> 23:21.149
-Anybody get the license of that truck?
-Don't move.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.610
I'm sorry, fella. You came out of nowhere.

23:23.693 --> 23:24.736
It's okay.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.656
Mick. Hey, Mick. How's the chair?
Is the chair all right?

23:27.739 --> 23:30.909
Will you forget about the stupid chair?
You hurt anywhere?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.327
How would I know that?

23:33.745 --> 23:38.375
-Move your arm, move your fingers.
-It's okay. I'm all right.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.919
He just clipped me, is all.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.631
Get me back to the chair,
okay, Mick? Come on.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.384
He came out like a crazy man!
I could have killed him!

23:47.467 --> 23:50.804
Hey, don't have a cow, all right, buddy?
No lawsuit.

23:53.723 --> 23:57.561
-Hey, we got him, didn't we, Mick?
-(growling)

23:57.644 --> 24:00.772
-You are under arrest, dirtbag.
-What?

24:06.027 --> 24:09.489
Short date for the preliminary,
illegal possession and discharge.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.867
Preliminary hearing, 1:00 p.m. tomorrow.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.285
(gavel bangs)

24:13.368 --> 24:15.120
-Ten-minute recess.
-All rise.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.590
-His Honor got a minute? Court business.
-Chambers.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.762
-(knock on door)
-Uh, Judge Cole?

24:33.555 --> 24:34.389
Yes?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.057
Detective John LaRue, Hill Street.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.727
What can I do for you, Detective?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.729
Just give me
a couple minutes of your time.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.439
Shut it.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.733
(door closes)

24:45.233 --> 24:46.526
(sighs)

24:48.778 --> 24:50.363
Uh, I'm one of the arresting officers

24:50.447 --> 24:52.699
on a case you got coming up,
that boy Rothmore.

24:52.782 --> 24:54.117
You arraign him this afternoon.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.702
And?

24:55.785 --> 24:59.331
-I'd like to give you a little background.
-As long as it's only a little.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.254
This kid's got problems,
most of them behind the wheel.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.465
-You got kids, Your Honor? Teenagers?
-Two.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.842
Well, then I don't have to tell you
anything about kids.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.887
Uh, this kid's got great parents,
and they're just sick about this.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.681
Now, they realize
Walter's gonna get a fine,

25:16.765 --> 25:19.100
but they're real worried
'cause it's his fifth offense.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.770
Fifth offense should buy him 60 days.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.523
There it is. That's the tragedy.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.401
See, his folks are hoping he'll
get past this and go on to college,

25:29.069 --> 25:30.570
but with that on his record...

25:32.155 --> 25:33.949
Your point, Detective?

25:34.032 --> 25:39.412
You see, Walter's parents are involved
in all sorts of charity work.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.915
Now, what they said to me was,

25:41.998 --> 25:44.668
they'd like to make
an appropriate contribution.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.255
Two thousand dollars.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.132
In return for?

25:51.967 --> 25:54.010
A little understanding
of this kid's situation,

25:54.094 --> 25:56.179
a little looking out for his future.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.557
(sighs)

26:00.058 --> 26:03.270
Now, I think the PBA
should get half the money,

26:03.353 --> 26:08.316
and... well, some judicial charity,
the other half.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.654
I'm not opposed to showing a little mercy,

26:13.530 --> 26:15.407
if the occasion merits it.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.325
Oh, I think it does, Your Honor.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.287
I think this is a salvageable kid.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.415
Now, they were wondering...

26:24.291 --> 26:28.545
that if they do make
a charitable contribution...

26:30.130 --> 26:31.840
Could you choose it for them?

26:33.925 --> 26:34.759
What's that?

26:36.511 --> 26:38.013
A thousand cash...

26:40.765 --> 26:42.142
for the judicial charity.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.769
Suspended sentence.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.108
They'll really appreciate that.

26:57.532 --> 27:01.745
Oh, there's a couple officers
waiting outside to see you.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.705
-Should I show 'em in?
-Who?

27:04.247 --> 27:05.915
They'll introduce themselves.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.548
What's going on?

27:14.341 --> 27:15.842
You're under arrest, Your Honor.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.566
-Just trying to call you.
-Henry.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.652
I'm sorry.
I should have called you before.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.570
Can we talk?

27:37.155 --> 27:38.156
Now?

27:39.574 --> 27:40.450
Sure.

27:53.296 --> 27:57.258
So did we ruin
a perfectly good relationship or what?

27:58.927 --> 28:00.261
You know better than that.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.222
I called you twice.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.766
I waited all day for you
to return my calls.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.435
It was inconsiderate.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.313
(sighs) I didn't hear you go this morning.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.981
I didn't want to wake you.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.110
Tell me the truth.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.779
Were you disappointed with me?

28:19.280 --> 28:20.407
God...

28:21.950 --> 28:22.784
No.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.328
Well, then why did you leave?

28:25.829 --> 28:27.997
-I guess I was scared.
-Of what?

28:30.166 --> 28:32.210
(sighs) I don't know.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.548
Didn't please you, maybe.

28:36.631 --> 28:37.966
(exhales)

28:39.134 --> 28:40.468
Are you kidding?

28:42.345 --> 28:45.724
Henry... you're a wonderful lover.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.436
Oh.

28:52.147 --> 28:52.981
Thank you.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.947
Do you want to go
to the Shore for the weekend?

29:02.949 --> 29:03.783
This weekend?

29:03.867 --> 29:06.202
(chuckles)
Yeah, we could leave Frank Jr. with Frank,

29:06.286 --> 29:08.747
take the baby with us,
you know, nothing fancy.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.666
Uh... yes.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.878
-(giggles) Just get away.
-Let's do it.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.212
Are you sure?

29:17.672 --> 29:19.340
Yes, Fay, I'm sure.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.177
(laughs)

29:30.393 --> 29:33.605
-Come on, move!
-I knew what I was doing!

29:33.688 --> 29:34.981
You mean you were trying
to get yourself killed.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.358
I was leading him
a little too far, that's all.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.360
You're gonna lead him
right into jail, nosebleed.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.530
I am through with this from you.
Now, you go in there and wait for me.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.365
Taylor, Herbert,

29:44.449 --> 29:47.160
suspicion, grand theft person
and resisting arrest.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.454
Hey, what about me?
I thought I was under arrest, too.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.289
I said get in there!

29:51.372 --> 29:55.877
-Let's have an address, Mr. Taylor.
-1412 East Utica.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.796
What are you, deaf to plain English?

30:00.298 --> 30:02.675
-What's the matter? You okay?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.886
I told you a million times.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.430
I just need some water. I'm thirsty.

30:08.264 --> 30:09.974
Over there, and then I want to
see you at my desk.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.810
Yeah, yeah, okay!

30:25.323 --> 30:26.241
(door opens)

30:28.576 --> 30:30.995
-Frank.
-Howard.

30:34.332 --> 30:37.919
(door opens, closes)

30:38.002 --> 30:39.754
I was waiting for you to come see me.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.714
Here I am.

30:43.967 --> 30:47.428
I want you to know
I spoke to Chief Daniels about the tapes.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.514
Well, I don't think there's any need
to protect me, Frank.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.349
I'm fully prepared to confront

30:51.432 --> 30:53.977
whatever charges the department
wishes to bring against me.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.854
There aren't gonna be any, Howard.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.107
But, frankly, I don't think
departmental consequences

30:59.190 --> 31:01.192
should be your biggest concern right now.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.737
Well, it seems to me that we've proven
my ability to do the job.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.825
And, uh, in all due respect, uh...

31:09.325 --> 31:11.828
I'm not sure that anything further
is your business.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.121
I'm also your friend.

31:13.204 --> 31:17.375
-Friends respect each other's privacy.
-Privacy, yes.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.252
Not hurtful isolation, Howard.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.671
As your captain, I have to be concerned

31:21.754 --> 31:24.173
about the 20 people
working under you, too.

31:25.466 --> 31:28.052
Now, you haven't seen one moment
of behavior from me

31:28.136 --> 31:31.472
that would give you any reason
for concern, nor will you.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.142
I'm sorry, but handling
one situation in the field

31:34.225 --> 31:35.602
doesn't convince me, Howard.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.188
Frank, I've given you no cause.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.066
Judas, don't take my job away.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.902
That's not my present intention.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.530
But I'm asking you, please,
to seek professional help.

31:47.614 --> 31:51.284
-I'm urging you to--
-I don't believe that that's necessary.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.995
I don't think you even realize
what you've done.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.248
(scoffs) I botched a suicide attempt.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.628
I had a box of live shells in my closet

32:01.711 --> 32:04.297
and ample opportunity
to make a second attempt work.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.007
Frank, I chose life.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.216
Come on, Howard.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.636
If J.D. hadn't done what he'd done,
you'd be dead right now.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.930
There's no neat capsule
you can fit that into.

32:12.513 --> 32:15.850
I'm asking you to seek help... please.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.020
I'm asking as a friend.

32:21.272 --> 32:24.484
Well, as a friend... I'll consider it.

32:28.863 --> 32:29.906
(door opens)

32:35.995 --> 32:37.330
MICK: Let's have some room.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.790
-Call the paramedics.
-What happened?

32:38.873 --> 32:40.708
He was drinking water. I was behind him.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.252
He kept drinking water,
and then he just fell out of the chair.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.420
Get his feet elevated.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.882
All right, we're gonna need
a blanket here. Blanket!

32:48.549 --> 32:49.926
MICK: Everybody stand back.

32:51.010 --> 32:51.970
He's not breathing.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.137
Medics are on their way.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.267
What's wrong? What'd you stop for?
Help him.

32:58.726 --> 33:01.646
I was just talking to him.
Come on, damn it! Breathe!

33:01.729 --> 33:03.356
Move away, Mick, please.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.944
Jeez, I was just talking to him.

33:21.582 --> 33:23.292
I was told they were
bringing in Judge Cole.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.585
Just coming in now.

33:25.461 --> 33:28.756
Irwin, Irwin!
Irwin, there's been a terrible mistake.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.968
Get him into interrogation.
Get Captain Furillo.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.602
IRWIN:
Judge Cole, you've been advised.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.397
Irwin, listen to what
I'm trying to tell you.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.107
I'd suggest you have an attorney present.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.193
There is absolutely
no need for an attorney.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.196
What you'll hear on that tape
is my trying to elicit evidence

33:52.280 --> 33:54.198
after felonious solicitation.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.575
What about these, Judge?

33:55.658 --> 33:57.410
What were you trying to elicit
in the bus depot?

34:02.040 --> 34:05.293
I was in a bus terminal.
What's that supposed to prove?

34:05.376 --> 34:07.962
We have pictures of you
picking up a bag of money,

34:08.046 --> 34:11.799
we have the bag, $10,000 in cash inside,
we have the wire, and we have you.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.509
But I'm not gonna prosecute you, Judge.

34:13.593 --> 34:14.969
I'm turning you.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.638
You're gonna give us faces,
names, and places,

34:17.722 --> 34:21.059
and then you're gonna resign in disgrace,
which is what you are.

34:26.189 --> 34:29.067
Captain, I just got a call.
We lost the tail on Seltzer.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.276
-Damn.
-He shook it.

34:30.359 --> 34:33.154
-Try to pick it up.
-Guy like that's got a lot of mouse holes.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.827
I'm getting real bad feelings, Frank.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.623
About?

34:44.207 --> 34:45.333
All of it.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.879
You've got people openly
making and receiving bribes.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.131
That establishes habit and duration.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.550
It establishes a belief of impunity.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.386
-Let's see where it goes, Irwin.
-I'm trying to make a point, Frank.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.222
I know, and I'm saying to take it easy.

34:59.305 --> 35:03.184
My point is this,
if this is in the fabric of things,

35:03.267 --> 35:05.478
if you've got a pervasive corruption...

35:07.814 --> 35:09.816
Driving up, I'm thinking,
"This could go anyplace.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.776
This could reach into my own office."

35:13.319 --> 35:14.695
I'm a company man, Frank.

35:15.571 --> 35:17.031
It scares me not knowing who to trust.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.991
We could start with each other, Irwin.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.245
I'd appreciate that.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.872
I'd appreciate having someone to talk to.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.666
Same for me.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.085
Thanks, Frank.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.839
(sighs) Sorry about getting so nervous.

35:41.722 --> 35:42.723
Hey, Kenny.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.354
-John?
-Yeah?

35:49.814 --> 35:52.150
I want to apologize
for my outburst this morning.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.151
Hey, no problem.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.195
Especially under the circumstances.
It was unconscionable.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.743
I believe these are yours.

36:05.913 --> 36:06.831
Uh, Lieutenant?

36:10.376 --> 36:12.879
-You feeling okay?
-Yes.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.258
You know, in Japan,
your sort of intercession would entail

36:17.341 --> 36:21.179
you're watching over the rest
of my... my earthly career.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.263
Oh, yeah?

36:25.141 --> 36:27.518
I want you to feel no such obligation.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.650
-Thank you, John.
-(stutters) Uh, it's okay.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.321
It's okay.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.915
I'm Tom Shorter. I own the goose.

36:48.998 --> 36:52.084
Oh, sure, Mr. Shorter.
He's right back there.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.879
The, uh, cell door's unlocked.
You can just take him home.

36:54.962 --> 36:55.963
Thanks.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.304
(goose honking)

37:08.768 --> 37:11.395
I gave you artichoke hearts.

37:12.188 --> 37:16.192
I bought you live grasshoppers,
and this is what you do to me.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.569
You obey other people.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.572
You go out on your own. You...

37:23.074 --> 37:27.787
I ought to... wring your neck.

37:29.789 --> 37:30.957
(honking, squawking)

37:31.040 --> 37:34.210
Leo! Leo, what's going on with that goose?

37:35.836 --> 37:39.882
What have you done?
You have killed a defenseless animal.

37:39.966 --> 37:43.844
I didn't. I swear. I never touched him.

37:44.762 --> 37:49.892
I walked in to put the leash on,
and he just... fell over.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.436
I could have you arrested for
cruelty to animals.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.398
Wait a minute. I could just say
I was gonna eat him.

37:55.481 --> 37:59.235
Then I'll have you arrested for
slaughtering livestock in a public area.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.240
-You keep doing it to me.
-Get out of here.

38:04.323 --> 38:07.535
Get out of here before I'm no longer
responsible for my actions.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.619
Poor guy.

38:09.036 --> 38:10.788
After all he went through.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.418
Must weigh 30, 35 pounds.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.255
Probably all dark meat.

38:19.922 --> 38:23.009
-Ice.
-Upstairs refrigerator.

38:23.551 --> 38:27.388
I think there is a container
in supply that's big enough.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.976
-We gonna do it?
-I'm gonna kick some butt.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.270
-We gonna show some stuff?
-If I don't get him in 30 seconds--

38:34.353 --> 38:35.855
-Cut it out.
-Then he's gonna do it to me.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.398
Roberto, with thoughts like that,

38:37.481 --> 38:39.483
Norman Vincent Peale
would have died broke.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.651
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

38:40.735 --> 38:41.902
-Yeah. You gonna hurt somebody?
-Uh-huh!

38:41.986 --> 38:42.987
-I'm gonna hurt somebody!
-You gonna hurt somebody bad?

38:43.070 --> 38:44.655
-Yeah, I'm gonna hurt somebody bad!
-You gonna cause some misery?

38:44.739 --> 38:45.990
-Yeah, misery!
-Get up, show me how to do it!

38:46.073 --> 38:48.951
Get up and show me how! That's right!
Go on! Let's go out there and get him!

38:49.035 --> 38:50.202
-Get up and show me how!
-I'm gonna get him!

38:50.286 --> 38:51.370
Get up and show me how!
Get up and show me how!

38:51.454 --> 38:52.747
I'm gonna get him!

38:52.830 --> 38:54.498
(banging)

38:56.334 --> 39:00.921
-Hey, hey, hey, hey! What you doing?
-I forgot my combination.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.091
-It's 17 something.
-Hey, we can arrest you, Bobby.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.593
I got 13 bucks in there.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.928
Give me that! Forget that, man!
Forget that. Forget that crap!

39:08.012 --> 39:09.805
You were breaking in there, weren't you?

39:10.473 --> 39:12.350
-Weren't you?
-Yeah.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.436
I just needed a few bucks.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.021
Go on.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.026
Now, I'm gonna let you
walk away from this one, Bobby,

39:22.109 --> 39:23.652
but that's the last rhythm
you're gonna get.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.821
All right. Okay.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.618
-I'm sorry.
-Take off.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.794
I'll see you, Steve. Good luck.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.967
(clanging)

39:47.510 --> 39:48.636
-Yeah?

39:48.719 --> 39:50.262
-Hey!
-Hey, how you doin'?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.806
How does he look? How's he feeling?

39:51.889 --> 39:54.642
He's gonna kill him. He's gonna do
Pearl Harbor with this guy.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.228
Is he doing the Americans
or the Japanese?

39:58.145 --> 40:00.981
Introducing, in the blue corner...

40:01.649 --> 40:03.401
representing Hill Street...

40:03.734 --> 40:06.654
weighing 163 pounds...

40:06.737 --> 40:08.823
Bobby "Blueberry" Hill!

40:08.906 --> 40:11.117
(cheering)

40:11.200 --> 40:14.829
(chanting) Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

40:14.912 --> 40:17.081
Representing division vice...

40:17.164 --> 40:21.377
at 165 pounds, Dwight Stafford!

40:21.460 --> 40:24.296
(booing)

40:24.380 --> 40:25.798
Boo!

40:28.384 --> 40:31.720
-Damn, that man is ugly.
-That man is butt-ugly.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.307
For metro middleweight championship...

40:35.391 --> 40:36.934
three rounds of boxing.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.731
(bell dings)

40:44.316 --> 40:46.861
Okay, Bobby, only 30 seconds! Go!

40:46.944 --> 40:49.947
Take him down. Take him down.
Come on, Bobby. Take him on down.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.949
Fight, fight. Stay alive. Stay alive.

40:52.032 --> 40:54.618
Come on. Come on, fight, fight.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.663
Take it easy, Bobby.
Give him an uppercut. Yeah!

41:00.875 --> 41:02.084
Come on, Bobby!

41:02.168 --> 41:03.627
-Get him, Bobby!
-JOE: Come on, Bobby!

41:03.711 --> 41:05.212
Jab! Do it again!

41:05.296 --> 41:06.964
Jab. Jab. Do it again! Keep him down!
Come on there, Bobby!

41:07.047 --> 41:09.592
Keep him down. Keep him down.

41:09.675 --> 41:12.344
Jab! Do it again!
Jab! Jab! Do it again. Keep him down.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.888
Come on, now, Bobby! Come on, jab!
Jab! Do it again.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.599
-J.D.: Bobby, 15!
-RENKO: Fifteen! 15! 15!

41:16.682 --> 41:17.975
Get him, Bobby!

41:18.058 --> 41:19.268
Keep your hands up.

41:19.351 --> 41:20.769
Twenty! Come on, ten more!

41:20.853 --> 41:25.107
Keep playing him! Come on, Bobby!
Just play him! Keep playing him!

41:25.191 --> 41:26.066
Keep playing!

41:26.150 --> 41:27.735
Come on, five more.

41:27.818 --> 41:32.948
(overlapping chatter)

41:34.992 --> 41:37.661
(booing)

41:37.745 --> 41:41.040
One, two, three...

41:41.123 --> 41:43.626
Get up, Bobby! Get up!

41:43.709 --> 41:46.545
Six, seven, eight...

41:47.546 --> 41:51.133
-Nine, ten!
-(bell dings)

41:52.760 --> 41:54.386
Bobby, he's done cold-cocked you.

41:55.846 --> 41:56.722
(snaps)

41:59.058 --> 42:01.435
Hey, Bobby. Do you know where you are?

42:02.561 --> 42:03.896
St. Louis?

42:05.397 --> 42:06.398
Is that mama?

42:08.275 --> 42:09.735
Do you want me to go call him?

42:10.277 --> 42:11.904
Mama? Mama?

42:12.446 --> 42:14.240
He's supposed to come around.

42:15.574 --> 42:18.118
I was supposed to meet him at the station.

42:18.994 --> 42:22.081
(sighs) I think he's gonna be late.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.084
Say goodnight, Gracie.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.836
(water dripping)

42:28.754 --> 42:30.172
(sighs)

42:39.723 --> 42:41.016
(groans)

42:42.393 --> 42:45.229
-Bobby, you hurt?
-Only his pride, Joseph.

42:45.312 --> 42:47.398
And my head and my body.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.860
Listen, if you're up for it,
why don't we go have a beer after this?

42:51.944 --> 42:53.988
Yeah, yeah, I'd like that, Joe.

42:54.738 --> 42:58.075
All right, so I'll meet you at Mulligan's?
I'll have them set up an IV drip.

42:58.158 --> 43:00.619
(both chuckle)

43:03.122 --> 43:06.041
(sighs) We had a tough night.

43:13.465 --> 43:16.218
Thanks, Larry. I appreciate the courtesy.

43:20.389 --> 43:23.309
They found Ben Seltzer
behind a supermarket in the Heights,

43:23.934 --> 43:25.477
shot five times.

43:27.896 --> 43:29.231
(sighs)

43:30.065 --> 43:31.984
It doesn't have to be Armageddon, Frank.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.361
They can all still be unrelated incidents.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.030
I wouldn't bet on it.

43:37.114 --> 43:40.117
I can't. My bookie just croaked.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.453
(both laugh)

43:44.788 --> 43:46.540
Tell me about your day.

43:48.500 --> 43:52.254
-(sighs) I had a C-plus.
-Hmm?

43:53.088 --> 43:56.133
I saw something in Neiman's
I may or may not buy you for Christmas.

43:56.216 --> 43:59.428
-Tell.
-No chance, and don't even guess.

44:03.265 --> 44:05.184
(sighs)

44:07.728 --> 44:10.022
I keep thinking about rats in the house.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.777
-For every one you see--
-Enough, Frank.

44:17.696 --> 44:20.407
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.201
Johnny one note.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.827
(laughs)

44:27.831 --> 44:30.793
-Well, he's walking pretty good.
-Lucky punch, that's all.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.086
I didn't see you in there

44:32.169 --> 44:34.463
-taking any shots, big guy.
-That's right.

44:34.546 --> 44:35.839
You know, the way
you went down, Bobby Hill,

44:35.923 --> 44:37.424
it is a wonder
you don't have a concussion.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.009
Hey, I'm just lucky
I don't have to do it again.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.636
-This kid is retired.
-Shoot.

44:40.719 --> 44:42.680
-Oh, come on, Andy, he made the finals.
-Shoot?

44:42.763 --> 44:45.557
-He's a silver medalist!
-That's right! And tomorrow I can wake up,

44:45.641 --> 44:48.894
my headache'll be gone,
and I'll still be pretty!

44:48.977 --> 44:50.646
And Stafford will still be...

44:50.729 --> 44:52.189
-Butt-ugly!
-Butt-ugly!

44:52.272 --> 44:54.233
-Butt-ugly!
-Butt-ugly!

44:54.316 --> 44:58.320
-Hey, Renko. Look.
-Let's just keep on walking.

44:58.404 --> 45:01.156
-(shouting)
-Not on my account.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.533
MAN: I didn't want to kill him!

45:04.576 --> 45:06.161
And I aimed for his leg!

45:07.579 --> 45:08.622
Aw, man!

45:08.706 --> 45:10.958
Hey, Steve! Bobby!

45:11.709 --> 45:13.419
Pretty damn stupid, Bobby.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.963
No brains.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.716
Too many shots to the head.

45:19.091 --> 45:23.095
-I figure a two-year bit, right?
-Three, maybe five.

45:24.930 --> 45:28.100
Upstate? Food's pretty good.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.977
I wouldn't know.

45:31.103 --> 45:32.396
Hey, Bobby, you win your fight?

45:33.355 --> 45:34.440
No.

45:34.815 --> 45:37.776
Don't worry. Don't get discouraged.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.364
(sighs)

45:43.699 --> 45:45.159
I want you to be careful up there.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.454
I done time before.

45:49.246 --> 45:50.873
It ain't so bad, hell.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.751
It's okay.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.629
You just take it easy.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.798
So long.

46:00.966 --> 46:02.634
Going home, huh, Steve?

46:04.636 --> 46:06.180
Thanks for the help.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.987
Gee, I thought sure
you'd wanna go see Bobby fight.

46:29.411 --> 46:31.830
Mick, it wasn't your fault.

46:36.835 --> 46:40.798
I think about him bleeding inside
and not even knowing it, dying.

46:43.342 --> 46:44.176
I killed him.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.596
-How can you say that?
-Because I promised him.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.848
I said I'd let him teach me
about wheelchairs,

46:49.932 --> 46:51.391
and then I told him to get lost,

46:51.475 --> 46:53.936
and I think people
were always promising him things

46:54.019 --> 46:56.772
and building his hopes up
and then telling him to get lost.

46:57.773 --> 46:59.525
You know, everything
you've told me about Gaffney

46:59.608 --> 47:01.485
reminds me of somebody else.

47:02.736 --> 47:07.407
-Independent, defensive, a loner.
-So?

47:09.701 --> 47:11.829
So maybe that's what's bothering you.

47:12.579 --> 47:14.581
You knew what he was
going through, but you--

47:14.915 --> 47:16.416
You didn't know how to tell him that.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.295
You understood each other,

47:20.379 --> 47:22.339
but you just didn't know
how to be friends.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.758
You... you couldn't make the connection.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.927
I respected him. He knew that.

47:29.471 --> 47:32.224
You know, when we first started
going together, I thought...

47:33.642 --> 47:35.686
"Any day now, Mick's gonna open up to me.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.398
He's gonna tell me all his secrets."

47:41.608 --> 47:42.818
But you never did.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.446
And after a while, I knew you never would.

47:48.448 --> 47:51.243
But that's okay.
Some people gotta be like that.

47:52.828 --> 47:54.538
But it's not always easy loving them.

47:58.959 --> 48:01.086
(voice breaking)
I shouldn't have yelled at him.

48:09.303 --> 48:12.431
(closing theme playing)
