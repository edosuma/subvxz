05:48.315 --> 05:50.350
Go after her!

06:13.273 --> 06:14.875
Jesus, Nadine.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.014
Shame on you, Gator.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.017
- There's a baby in this house.
- I saw her.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.753
She's like nine.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.521
Now get your ass
in that car, let's go.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.356
I'm not going back.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.258
Now, Nadine,

06:31.291 --> 06:34.061
we both know
you're going back,

06:34.094 --> 06:36.096
like it or not.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.576
She's in the basement.
Go get the husband.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.845
Is-is he--

06:51.879 --> 06:53.313
Focus.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.516
The kid gets you bonus points.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.857
Where are you, Mama?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.828
It's time to go home.

07:44.598 --> 07:49.236
Your husband--
it's Wayne, right?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.071
He's a nice guy.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.873
A little soft, maybe.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.275
Is that it?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.110
Is he soft?

07:58.646 --> 08:00.581
Well, you don't
come out of there,

08:00.614 --> 08:02.282
we're gonna find out.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.092
Wipe that stupid grin
off your face.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.099
Nadine.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.590
Can't find this fucking guy.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.186
Shit.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.264
- Mommy!
- Not now!

09:59.566 --> 10:01.301
Gator!

10:02.535 --> 10:03.971
Dot?!

10:10.744 --> 10:12.279
Stay, stay, okay?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.715
Come here! I'll kill you!

10:14.748 --> 10:15.849
- Babe?
- It's okay.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.818
- Nadine?
- They're up here!

10:17.851 --> 10:19.319
Hon, hold him.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.388
They're up here!

10:21.421 --> 10:22.823
Got 'em up here.
Wait, wait, wait.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.292
What are you gonna do with...
What are you--

10:25.325 --> 10:27.260
What are you-- Wait!

10:27.294 --> 10:29.529
- Go, Mom!
- I'm coming for you, Nadine.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.865
Quick.
Down the laundry chute.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.601
Nadine?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.403
Who's Nadine?

10:36.436 --> 10:38.205
- Wayne.
- No. That's...

10:38.238 --> 10:41.341
- You got me in the dark here.
- Get Scotty down the chute.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.344
No.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.179
- Jesus.
- Uh, down the... the master bedroom,

10:46.213 --> 10:48.782
the trellis,
we'll climb down. Go. - No. No, no.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.317
- Hon. Oh!
- Come here.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.853
Nadine!

10:52.886 --> 10:55.689
- Nadine!
- No, hon!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.674
- Wha... Oh.
- Daddy?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.509
Check his breathing.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.947
Nadine.

11:21.949 --> 11:22.950
Mom!

11:22.983 --> 11:24.351
Oh, my...

11:25.719 --> 11:27.454
Okay.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.361
Okay.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.096
Help me get him up.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.633
Scotty, don't focus on that.
Focus on this, okay?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.235
We got to sit him up.
Okay, baby?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.071
Yeah.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.008
Gosh.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.710
Okay.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.612
You're gonna climb out.
It's okay.

11:52.645 --> 11:53.881
Yeah.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.715
Good.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.885
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.788
Okay.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.656
Okay, mister...

12:03.690 --> 12:06.359
Out you go.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.938
Okay.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.144
Mom?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.380
Mom?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.983
Mom?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.588
Whoa!

12:37.524 --> 12:39.993
Trellis. Okay, come on.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.397
You're doing great.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.334
Careful.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.677
Okay.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.247
Wayne, honey?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.648
Wayne?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.783
I need you to wake up now.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.786
Nadine?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.356
Nadine?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.124
Ooh, sorry, baby.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.998
Ooh!

13:18.031 --> 13:21.501
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.983
Grab the stiff.
We're done.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.654
Okay.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.101
Well, old friend.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.138
It's the crossroads,
no question,

15:05.172 --> 15:08.208
and we know who's waiting there.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.644
The midnight man.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.316
With his serpent tongue.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.488
I met him once.

15:21.521 --> 15:26.126
Old Baylor Maze
cut his children to pieces

15:26.159 --> 15:31.298
and hung his wife
with a curtain tie,

15:31.331 --> 15:34.034
and I was first
through the door.

15:35.135 --> 15:39.106
And old Baylor was sitting there
in his easy chair...

15:39.139 --> 15:42.142
- Whoa.
- ...taking it easy.

15:44.011 --> 15:47.214
Behind him, I swear,

15:47.247 --> 15:50.317
and you know this
'cause you were there, too.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.288
Beelzebub himself,

15:55.322 --> 15:59.626
crouched low, whispering
in that poor man's ear.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.665
You protected me then,
old friend.

16:07.567 --> 16:11.338
Be with us again
in our hour of need.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.242
Amen.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.037
Daddy?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.224
- Mama?
- Yeah?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.891
Were those demons?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.293
No, hon.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.230
There's no such thing
as demons, only men.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.833
But why were they so mean and nasty?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.735
Listen to me, okay?

17:48.768 --> 17:50.437
We can't talk about those men.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.240
If we talk about them,
they come back, right?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.408
They hear you talking,
and they come back.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.379
You don't want them coming back,
do you?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.681
No.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.984
So we got to...

18:05.017 --> 18:08.321
If people ask,

18:08.355 --> 18:11.358
we got to say
it was just wires.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.761
Your dad touched some wires,
and that's how...

18:16.296 --> 18:19.999
And the scratches on his face,
that was...

18:20.032 --> 18:22.034
Him falling in the bushes.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.271
We-we chased him
with the zombie killer,

18:24.304 --> 18:26.539
'cause he was a zombie, right?

18:26.573 --> 18:30.577
And there he goes,
off into the bushes.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.545
That's right.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.681
Good. Yeah.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.486
He fell into some bushes.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.022
He fell into some bushes,

18:43.055 --> 18:47.227
and then when we got home,

18:47.260 --> 18:49.962
he touched a wire

18:49.996 --> 18:52.799
trying to plug in some lights.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.870
An accident.
That's what started the fire.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.611
Because bad things
don't happen to good people.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.914
The wicked stick
to the darkness,

19:07.947 --> 19:10.650
while we get to stay
in the light.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.656
But sometimes accidents happen.

19:18.225 --> 19:21.494
And we all know
your dad is clumsical.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.333
Always tripping
over his own left feet.

19:29.536 --> 19:33.473
And we know that
if you follow the rules

19:33.506 --> 19:36.476
and think of only good thoughts,

19:36.509 --> 19:40.447
that the kingdom of heaven
will be the reward.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.496
I blew up the image.
You'll see that next.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.668
- Huh.
- See?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.370
Yeah, that's her all right.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.706
And then... here I come.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.242
Ouch.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.545
And then the lights go out.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.316
So, nothing on the perp.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.684
Yeah, that's the shame.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.487
But they say ghosts don't
photograph anyway.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.456
A ghost?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.760
Something else.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.264
I get it even less now.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.466
You get grabbed up, taken,

20:33.500 --> 20:36.436
somehow you manage to get away,
get shot at,

20:36.469 --> 20:38.671
come to the aid of
a sworn officer,

20:38.705 --> 20:40.607
lifesaving actions.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.710
Why the heck would you pretend
none of it happened?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.413
I've seen trained soldiers
couldn't have kept with her.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.317
Get this. Five alarm fire
at the Lyon house.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.419
- What?
- Yeah.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.687
Fire boys are there right now
rooting out the cause.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.156
But Wayne's in the ER,
so you might-- yeah.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.491
Wait for me.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.577
- Olmstead.
- Mrs. Olmstead.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.279
This is Dale Pickney,
debt collection services.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.648
Oh, yeah.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.116
You know, this really isn't
a good time.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.552
It'll just take a minute.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.320
It starts as an itch.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.121
You want to make things right here,

21:29.155 --> 21:30.490
don't you, Ms. Olmstead?

21:30.523 --> 21:32.425
I want a new pair of shoes

21:32.459 --> 21:35.962
or maybe the minivan
finally gives up the ghost.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.465
Well, I see here
an outstanding uncollected debt

21:38.498 --> 21:43.336
from medical services
for $2,671.43.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.004
Yep. That was...

21:45.037 --> 21:47.607
Lars, my husband,
he-he degloved his ring finger

21:47.640 --> 21:49.676
in a--
in a fall last year.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.044
And just like that
you're in debt.

21:52.078 --> 21:55.482
Well, that debt's just sitting there accruing interest.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.850
The stress takes a toll on your body,

21:57.884 --> 22:00.252
like that old joke
about the hangman.

22:00.286 --> 22:01.754
You're at the end
of your old rope.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.022
You want to do what's right--

22:03.055 --> 22:04.824
People in debt feel powerless.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.560
They are powerless.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.362
Here at Redemption Services,

22:09.396 --> 22:10.963
we work to give them
their power back.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.701
Aren't you the one calling them
at breakfast and dinner?

22:16.836 --> 22:20.673
We call, of course,
but not like you say.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.910
These are professional
debt relief specialists.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.612
They're offering solutions--

22:25.645 --> 22:28.815
payment plans, timetables,
debt consolidation--

22:28.848 --> 22:32.685
intended to give people
their dignity back.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.787
Your company earned
record profits last year,

22:34.821 --> 22:36.689
buying consumer debt
the credit card companies

22:36.723 --> 22:39.692
and insurance companies had
written off as uncollectible.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.662
And you're telling me
that you turned those dead ends

22:42.695 --> 22:48.468
into $1.6 billion
with timetables and empathy?

22:52.338 --> 22:53.372
Mrs. Lyon, there's, uh...

22:53.406 --> 22:55.074
I said not to be disturbed.

22:55.107 --> 22:58.044
Yes, ma'am, but, uh...

23:02.148 --> 23:04.784
Your son's house is on fire.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.621
Of course.

23:08.655 --> 23:11.624
Here's what you need
to understand about Americans.

23:11.658 --> 23:14.326
They don't want a handout.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.296
What they're looking for
is an opportunity

23:17.329 --> 23:19.466
to fix it themselves.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.033
We give them that.

23:21.067 --> 23:25.004
Now, why don't we pick this up
again in the morning?

23:34.581 --> 23:37.884
Where is he?
Where's my son?

23:39.619 --> 23:42.722
Lorraine, they're looking at him
right now.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.458
Some kind of shock,
they're saying.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.794
Bad wiring, I guess.
You know, one minute, we--

23:47.827 --> 23:50.329
I want to talk to a doctor.
The head of the department.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.698
Which department?

23:53.165 --> 23:54.534
Call Larry.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.802
He's on the board
of the hospital.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.804
Tell him I expect
the Saudi package--

23:57.837 --> 23:59.872
private suite, experts flown in.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.541
That's not...

24:01.574 --> 24:04.544
I'm just saying,
he's resting now

24:04.577 --> 24:07.179
and then it'll be, you know,

24:07.213 --> 24:09.415
lickety-split, good as new.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.783
You're killing me here.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.384
I'm supposed to be
making up the sit-down

24:12.418 --> 24:14.353
with the Forbes reporter
20 minutes ago.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.923
That got blown yesterday
by the cops showing up

24:16.956 --> 24:18.390
on your last boondoggle,

24:18.424 --> 24:20.527
and here you go
burning down the house.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.029
Not-- I didn't burn it.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.566
Like I said, faulty wiring.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.735
We'll just get a hotel
for a few days.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.403
You expect my granddaughter
to live in a hotel?

24:31.437 --> 24:33.740
I'm not...

24:33.773 --> 24:36.809
- This just happened, so--
- Excuse me.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.179
We're waiting on service.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.781
Ma'am, this isn't a hotel.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.751
You got to check in at the desk,
just like everybody else.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.687
She's fired. Get her name.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.622
- Mrs. Lyon.
- Yes.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.758
No. Sorry, we're here
for your daughter-in-law.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.126
I knew it.
You're arresting her.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.329
Well, do-do something.
They're-they're arresting her.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.631
We're not-- This is Witt Farr,

24:58.665 --> 25:00.667
state trooper
over in North Dakota.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.134
But we'd like to talk
to Mrs. Lyon in private,

25:02.168 --> 25:03.570
clear some things up.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.572
My husband's unwell.
I can't leave his side.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.306
Well, technically, Mrs. Lyon,

25:07.339 --> 25:09.742
you're not by his side
right now, so...

25:09.776 --> 25:10.677
Hi.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.545
I got my daughter with me.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.914
I'm her grandmother.
I can watch her.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.716
Somebody better.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.885
Her house burned down
last night, under her watch.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.920
Yes, ma'am.
I heard about that.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.454
Fire department's there
right now,

25:22.488 --> 25:24.924
- extinguishing the embers.
- Bad wiring.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.726
I'm sure they'll do a thorough investigation,

25:26.759 --> 25:28.227
ferret out the root cause.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.362
Officers,
my client would be happy

25:30.396 --> 25:33.365
to schedule a sit-down, but
clearly this is not the time,

25:33.399 --> 25:34.901
given the circumstance.

25:34.934 --> 25:38.037
Well, see, I got to push back
on you there, Mr., uh...

25:38.070 --> 25:40.640
Graves. Esquire.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.975
I represent the family.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.412
Well, Mr. Graves.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.147
We've got one state trooper dead

25:48.180 --> 25:50.883
with the suspect on the loose
considered armed and dangerous.

25:50.917 --> 25:54.453
So there's considerable
exigency to the circumstances.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.955
And, Mrs. Lyon...

25:55.988 --> 25:58.257
It's good to see you again,
Mrs. Lyon.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.659
That...

26:03.562 --> 26:05.497
That's not accurate.

26:05.531 --> 26:09.135
Ah, well, first of all,

26:09.168 --> 26:11.070
I recognize you.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.639
And second,

26:12.672 --> 26:13.906
we pulled the security tape
from the Gas N Go,

26:13.940 --> 26:18.645
so it's-it's clear
you were there.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.814
And for the record, that's...
that's just reality.

26:21.848 --> 26:26.018
With all due respect,
we've got our own reality.

26:26.052 --> 26:29.555
You can't--
That's not a thing.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.490
Mommy?

26:31.523 --> 26:33.893
Hi, baby. I'm here.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.863
We're all here.
Grandma, too.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.832
Hi, Grandma.
Our house burned down. - No.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.734
And whose fault is that?

26:41.768 --> 26:43.770
Jack Skellington.

26:43.803 --> 26:44.837
Who?

26:44.871 --> 26:46.072
It's a character in a movie.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.641
How about you go get
something to eat

26:48.675 --> 26:50.442
from the vending machine?

26:50.476 --> 26:52.344
- Okay?
- Snickers?

26:52.378 --> 26:55.181
For breakfast?
Are we on welfare?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.749
It's fine.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.618
Snickers is fine.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.888
Danish.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.325
Oh.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.797
Here you go, kid.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.402
Mrs. Lyon.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.469
Dorothy.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.005
You got to tell me,

27:19.038 --> 27:21.741
who were those fellas,
and what did they want with you?

27:21.774 --> 27:23.843
I didn't...

27:25.377 --> 27:26.612
Please.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.281
I need to be with Wayne
right now.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.218
- Can you...
- Mrs. Lyon?

27:32.251 --> 27:34.620
- Yes.
- Oh, I meant...

27:34.653 --> 27:36.188
Your husband's awake.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.589
You'll watch Scotty?

27:37.623 --> 27:39.158
You don't have to tell me
to watch her.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.426
She's my granddaughter.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.795
You're the one
needs watching, I think.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.197
I mean, I've been waiting
for four fucking hours.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.833
Sir.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.936
Look, they're taking six feet
of my intestines tomorrow.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.171
All right? Cancer.
But not if you don't...

27:52.204 --> 27:54.040
I mean,
it's on the goddamn papers.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.975
Your gal's supposed to
do the enema. - Sir, sir...

27:56.008 --> 27:57.609
Well, where is she? I'm fucking waiting there

27:57.643 --> 27:59.511
- with my ass hanging out.
- Just calm down. Yeah.

27:59.545 --> 28:03.149
I mean, I've been waiting for four fucking hours.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.854
Hey, baby.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.261
Are you...

28:16.595 --> 28:18.164
How are you?

28:19.431 --> 28:20.867
Hi.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.838
Is everything...

28:27.239 --> 28:29.175
What did the doctor say?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.577
Nadine.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.379
No. That...

28:36.148 --> 28:38.250
I'm Dorothy.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.321
Dot.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.290
Remember?

28:44.323 --> 28:45.792
Your wife.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.097
My wife.

28:54.834 --> 28:59.638
Did they put you on something?
Morphine or something?

28:59.671 --> 29:00.907
Bring me the dang thing now.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.274
- I'll do it myself.
- Sir.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.910
Or a bottle of freaking Ex-Lax.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.012
I don't care,
I need this cancer out of me.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.747
Angry.

29:09.681 --> 29:12.084
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.854
Some people don't know
how to wait their turn.

29:16.388 --> 29:19.091
Did you...

29:19.125 --> 29:21.693
I'm wondering...

29:21.727 --> 29:24.430
what you remember about
what happened.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.666
Ladder.

29:27.699 --> 29:30.236
Well, no.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.204
No.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.208
You touched a wire, I guess.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.545
Got some kind of shock.

29:42.381 --> 29:46.152
You know, something like that
can play tricks on your mind,

29:46.185 --> 29:49.655
make you think you did something
that maybe you didn't.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.590
Mm.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.360
Ask Scotty. She'll tell you.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.363
We were out trick-or-treating,
then we came inside

29:57.396 --> 30:00.166
and you went to plug in
some lights, and...

30:01.467 --> 30:04.136
- My wife.
- Yeah.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.276
The one.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.814
I'm so sorry.

30:15.848 --> 30:18.584
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.156
Our house was on fire.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.194
I'm going to fix it.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.896
I promise.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.399
And the house.

30:36.102 --> 30:39.005
Or we'll build a new house,

30:39.038 --> 30:42.308
and we'll live just
like the fairy tale says.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.545
My wife.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.151
Move over, you.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.718
Have you seen his billboards?

31:26.752 --> 31:28.354
"A hard man for hard times."

31:28.387 --> 31:30.923
Meanwhile, he refuses
to enforce the basic law,

31:30.957 --> 31:33.792
which...
can you still call him a lawman

31:33.825 --> 31:35.461
if he skips that part
of his job?

31:35.494 --> 31:38.464
Maybe he loses the election,
and the whole thing goes away.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.933
Arrest him then, you're saying?
As a private citizen?

31:40.967 --> 31:45.271
No, I'm saying wash our hands.
Good riddance.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.339
Oh, so more like
a dysfunctional family

31:47.373 --> 31:49.608
than a federal law
enforcement agency.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.810
Smile and pretend
Daddy didn't touch our pee-pees

31:51.843 --> 31:53.279
when we were kids?

31:53.312 --> 31:55.647
- What?
- Weapons are missing, sir.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.149
Tactical equipment.

31:57.183 --> 31:58.650
We think he bought them
for his department,

31:58.684 --> 32:00.686
and then gave them
to his friends in the militia.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.989
- Odin Little.
- You think.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.124
We had an informant, but he disappeared.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.159
A lot of people disappear around this guy,

32:07.193 --> 32:09.161
including two of his wives.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.263
Just put one of his deputies
in the ground yesterday.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.065
Local coroner said car crash,

32:13.099 --> 32:14.766
but they had him buried
in less than 12 hours,

32:14.800 --> 32:16.235
so...

32:16.268 --> 32:17.869
Don't tell me
you want to dig him up.

32:17.903 --> 32:20.039
No. What we want to do
is increase the pressure.

32:20.072 --> 32:24.210
Send a message: respect
the rule of law, or else.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.450
In 1958,

32:31.483 --> 32:34.020
the Chinese went to war
with the sparrow.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.123
- Sir?
- Mao gave the order.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.358
The birds were eating
the people's seeds and grain.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.826
They had to go.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.629
So people all over the country
started beating on pots and pans

32:43.662 --> 32:45.631
to drive the birds mad.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.199
Death by exhaustion.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.268
Two billion sparrows exterminated,

32:49.301 --> 32:51.003
all praised a great leader.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.105
But do you know what happens
when you remove birds

32:53.139 --> 32:55.041
from a food chain?

32:58.744 --> 33:01.213
There's no one left to eat
the bugs and the locust.

33:01.247 --> 33:04.083
So instead of
solving a hunger problem,

33:04.116 --> 33:06.552
they end up creating
an even bigger one.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.321
You ever heard of
the Great Famine?

33:09.355 --> 33:12.058
Possibly 50 million Chinese
starving to death.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.093
- Sir...
- One step ahead.

33:14.126 --> 33:18.064
I'm not asking you
to play four-dimensional chess.

33:18.097 --> 33:22.068
I'm saying
think one step ahead.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.770
If we go to war
with the most powerful sheriff

33:24.803 --> 33:28.174
in North Dakota, whose fathers
and grandfathers were sheriffs,

33:28.207 --> 33:30.242
and who's connected
to the most powerful militia

33:30.276 --> 33:32.878
in the upper Midwest,

33:32.911 --> 33:34.613
what do you think happens next?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.517
Until you can answer
that question,

33:38.550 --> 33:42.154
I want you to make Roy Tillman
more like a hobby of yours,

33:42.188 --> 33:43.589
something you do
in your spare time

33:43.622 --> 33:47.826
when you're not punishing
the actual criminals.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.129
You're on his side.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.265
We're done here.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.302
Thank you for your time, sir.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.071
- A hobby?
- Tony.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.872
I mean,
can you believe this guy? - They found her.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.474
It's the bulwark.
We're the bulwark.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.476
It's in the Constitution.
I mean, he should...

34:04.510 --> 34:06.078
he should read it maybe,
you know?

34:06.112 --> 34:07.946
Like,
it's-it's the justice system.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.315
It's a system of justice.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.817
You know, not like
just one man on a horse.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.086
- Tony.
- What?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.821
They found her.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.556
Nadine. The second wife.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.358
We just got a hit
on her fingerprints.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.727
Living in Minnesota
under a different name.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.062
Dorothy Lyon.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.765
Feels like fate, right?

34:26.798 --> 34:28.567
- Hobby my ass.
- Ah.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.374
When Munch was a boy...

34:37.209 --> 34:41.847
...freedom was a potato.

34:44.316 --> 34:47.353
It was you didn't get killed today.

34:48.587 --> 34:53.192
Freedom from hunger,
from the rusty blade.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.463
But to free himself,

34:57.496 --> 35:02.168
the man ate first
so others could not.

35:02.201 --> 35:05.437
He killed before he was killed.

35:07.072 --> 35:09.575
He wanted nothing more,

35:09.608 --> 35:13.845
because only kings...

35:16.748 --> 35:19.351
...had the freedom to want.

35:21.119 --> 35:26.024
But now everywhere you look,

35:26.057 --> 35:28.227
you see kings.

35:29.695 --> 35:33.299
Everything they want,
they call their own,

35:33.332 --> 35:37.869
and if they cannot have it,
they say that they are not free.

35:39.338 --> 35:43.041
They even pretend
their freedom should be free,

35:43.074 --> 35:44.743
that it has no cost,

35:44.776 --> 35:48.180
but the cost is always...

35:49.715 --> 35:51.450
...death.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.854
Life for life.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.659
Me...

36:08.234 --> 36:09.701
...or you.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.975
Please.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.778
I don't understand.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.449
Why are you here?

36:25.183 --> 36:26.885
What do you want?

36:38.630 --> 36:40.532
Pancakes.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.401
What happened?

37:16.702 --> 37:19.671
Boogeyman came, left a warning
in the kids' room.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.174
- Who, Munch?
- I don't know his name.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.976
Full-on wild man, though.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.413
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.915
Where's Roy?

37:44.195 --> 37:46.432
No funny business this time.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.537
Got some groceries, then.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.677
Joshua.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.680
What?

38:01.713 --> 38:04.082
"Now, after the death of Moses

38:04.115 --> 38:05.584
"the servant of the Lord,
it came to pass,

38:05.617 --> 38:09.020
"that the Lord spake
unto Joshua,

38:09.054 --> 38:11.557
"the son of Nun,
Moses' minister,

38:11.590 --> 38:14.926
"saying,
'Moses my servant is dead;

38:14.960 --> 38:17.896
"now therefore arise,
go over this Jordan,

38:17.929 --> 38:21.299
"thou, and all these people,
unto the land

38:21.333 --> 38:22.668
"which I do give to them,

38:22.701 --> 38:25.937
even to the children
of Israel.'"

38:25.971 --> 38:27.238
Joshua.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.310
What the fuck
you talking about?

38:33.445 --> 38:36.047
Did you tend to your man
like I said?

38:36.081 --> 38:38.550
Make him feel respected?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.887
Nobody asked you to come here.

38:43.789 --> 38:47.225
See, there were 12 spies
of Israel,

38:47.258 --> 38:49.127
sent to scout
the Land of Canaan.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.597
Joshua was one of the good ones.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.400
Are you one of the good ones,
Joshua?

39:04.175 --> 39:06.612
I tried.

39:08.714 --> 39:12.818
My great grandfather's name
was Roy, Indian killer,

39:12.851 --> 39:17.322
fought in the battle of
Big Mound, Dead Buffalo Lake.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.591
Lost an ear
in the Battle of the Badlands.

39:19.625 --> 39:23.829
He's the only American to ever
earn four Medals of Honor.

39:23.862 --> 39:28.066
Now, he was one of
the good ones.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.604
Me, I try to be.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.509
You... not so much, I think.

39:39.845 --> 39:43.281
You're what we call
a waste of skin.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.383
Defective.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.953
Eating our food,
breathing our air,

39:47.986 --> 39:50.622
wasting precious resources.

39:51.523 --> 39:55.661
Yeah, keep talking,
see what happens.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.296
See, now your beta male thinks

39:58.329 --> 40:00.632
that having a firearm
makes him an alpha,

40:00.666 --> 40:03.602
but it's just lipstick
on a pig, you feel me?

40:03.635 --> 40:05.904
You don't know
when to fucking quit, do you?

40:05.937 --> 40:07.806
Babe, don't.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.746
A man threatened my children
last night.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.850
Came to my house,
face painted like an Apache.

40:18.884 --> 40:22.688
Maybe it wasn't a man.
Some-some kind of spirit.

40:25.023 --> 40:29.427
My point is, this-- you...

40:30.629 --> 40:33.164
Like a paper airplane
in the rain.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.177
Fuck it.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.859
Fucking hell.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.831
You okay?

41:07.833 --> 41:11.102
Can I get a glass of water?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.871
Lenore?

41:30.388 --> 41:32.423
Uh... Dad?

41:32.457 --> 41:34.225
Uh, what are we doing?

41:34.259 --> 41:36.695
Oh, did you get her?

41:38.830 --> 41:42.233
- Um...
- Don't bother, I can see it all over your face.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.035
Worked you over pretty good,
did she?

41:44.069 --> 41:45.971
Uh, Lenore.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.775
Dad, that Nadine, it's--
I don't know.

41:49.808 --> 41:53.912
It's like he said,
some kind of tiger.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.949
The husband got hurt.
House caught on fire.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.018
Not now.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.192
Um, we got Munch.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.459
You did?

42:08.493 --> 42:09.661
Got him right there
on the couch.

42:09.695 --> 42:10.996
The guy
from the filling station.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.330
The cop killer.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.832
Tip came in over the hotline.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.967
Lenore here called it in
herself, didn't you, Lenore?

42:16.001 --> 42:18.336
I...

42:18.369 --> 42:20.906
Husband came home bragging
he killed a state trooper,

42:20.939 --> 42:23.274
wounded another one,
I responded.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.910
Shots fired.
You were my backup.

42:24.943 --> 42:28.747
- So...
- Loop's closed, I'm saying.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.616
States can call off their dogs,

42:30.649 --> 42:34.686
and we're free to settle
our differences in private.

42:35.987 --> 42:36.922
Huh.

42:36.955 --> 42:40.025
Now, all I need to know
from you

42:40.058 --> 42:42.628
is that you see
how this helps you.

42:44.529 --> 42:46.832
No more black eyes
and broken bones.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.100
Cash in your pocket
every month,

42:49.134 --> 42:52.137
'cause Roy Tillman
never forgets a friend.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.841
And we're friends,
aren't we, darling?

42:57.609 --> 42:59.444
Y-Yes, Roy.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.680
Attagirl.

43:17.528 --> 43:21.132
Think I'll go for a ride,
clear my head.

43:37.749 --> 43:40.218
All right, buddy, let's go.
Come on.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.287
Come on, hon, let's go.

46:59.617 --> 47:02.587
Now I get it.
