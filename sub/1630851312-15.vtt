00:04.047 --> 00:06.397
I can't wait to see
your new renovations.

00:06.441 --> 00:08.747
I have not been
this excited for a reveal

00:08.791 --> 00:11.663
since L.A. announced
their new composting program.Oh, yeah.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.710
You'reexcited?

00:14.753 --> 00:17.234
We've been living
with our parents for 140 days.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.671
Uh, I had 175.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.630
At least that's
what it felt like.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.240
You?

00:23.284 --> 00:25.677
I was about ready to Shawshank
my way out of there.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.376
Well, so hold on,

00:28.419 --> 00:30.813
Calvin, did you really
let Tina handle everything?

00:30.856 --> 00:32.945
Yes.Look.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.470
All I wanted to know was
how much is it gonna cost,

00:35.513 --> 00:37.689
and when is it
gonna be done?

00:37.733 --> 00:39.474
Well, it's all done now.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.476
And the earthquake insurance
paid for most of it.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.738
Most of it?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.131
How much did we...?

00:44.174 --> 00:45.915
Welcome, everybody, welcome!Yay!

00:47.264 --> 00:48.874
Welcome!

00:48.918 --> 00:51.051
Oh, my God!

00:51.094 --> 00:52.791
This is like the best episode

00:52.835 --> 00:54.924
of Fixer Upperever.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.145
Wow.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.972
Well, I sure hate our house now.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.626
Right?

01:01.670 --> 01:03.237
This is amazing.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.195
I wish it was this ritzy
when we were kids.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.415
Hey, it's not ritzy-- hey!Oh...

01:07.458 --> 01:09.852
D-Don't touch anything.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.898
It's a good thing it wasn't
this nice when we were young,

01:12.942 --> 01:14.378
'cause we would've
destroyed it.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.163
Oh, yeah, definitely, yeah,
we would've broken that.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.947
Yep.We would've broken that.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.036
We definitely
would've broken all that.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.125
And, look, Gemma![gasps]

01:22.169 --> 01:23.561

01:23.605 --> 01:25.650
No more
lukewarm chardonnay.
Oh!

01:25.694 --> 01:27.304
[chuckles]

01:27.348 --> 01:31.091
So, Calvin, what do you
think about the new digs?

01:31.134 --> 01:34.311
Well, it's a lot of
big changes, but, um,

01:34.355 --> 01:36.400
I like what I've done
with the place.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.836
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.275
You? You fought every single
change the whole way.

01:41.318 --> 01:44.104
Oh, Tina, Tina.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.149
How about we leave
the old attitude

01:46.193 --> 01:47.803
at the old house?

01:47.846 --> 01:49.544
It just doesn't go
with the decor.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.156

welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:53.200 --> 01:54.462

02:02.513 --> 02:04.559
it's almost
like an actual island.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.996
Nice.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.085
Now, when I tell the ladies
I've been to the islands,

02:09.129 --> 02:11.131
I won't be lying.

02:13.742 --> 02:14.960
Excuse me.

We have guests, baby.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.794
Well, don't blame me, babe.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.884
I mean, you're the one
that reupholstered my old chair.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.756
Hmm.
And she's so pretty,

02:27.799 --> 02:29.540
I might have to give her a name.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.413
Well, I'm glad
you like it,

02:32.456 --> 02:33.849
but if you name it,

02:33.892 --> 02:35.416
both of y'all gonna be
in the backyard.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.506
Just saying.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.769
Ooh, check out Mom's
new fancy refrigerator.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.771
It makes five different
types of ice.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.033
Ice is ice, Marty.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.295
How many different types
do you need?

02:45.339 --> 02:47.123
Oh, you simple man.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.301
This makes crushed,
cubed, shaved, pebbled,

02:51.345 --> 02:53.999

02:56.306 --> 02:58.134
Aha.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.831

Your home is just gorgeous!

03:10.233 --> 03:12.540
Oh, well, thank you,
Miss Kim.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.803
I'm so glad you chose to stay

03:14.846 --> 03:17.893
and remodel, instead of moving
out of the neighborhood.

03:17.936 --> 03:21.592
It's about time this
block started to change.

03:21.636 --> 03:25.074
Yeah, well, n-no, I'm not
trying to change anything.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.599
You've changed everything.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.995
I just hope you haven't
changed your bedroom curtains.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.650
I like seeing your
silhouettes at night.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.131
Tina, are you hearing
all this?

03:39.175 --> 03:41.308
Yeah, got it--
blackout curtains.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.526
Uh, Miss Kim?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.398
Would you like
to see our bedroom

03:44.441 --> 03:46.051
from the inside
for a change?

03:46.095 --> 03:47.183
Oh, goodie.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.403
Okay, right this way.

in this house anymore.

Me neither. He even
bougied out his chair.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.634
Well, you know,
I upgraded her

04:03.678 --> 04:05.288
a little bit, man.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.942
And she hugs my body

04:06.985 --> 04:08.944
like I just came home
from the war.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.728

Mm.

one of us.
Mm-hmm.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.549
Now he done gone Hollywood.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.030
Can we even use slang
in this house anymore?

04:52.074 --> 04:53.684

Hey, man.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.296

Mm.Ain't nothing changed about me

04:58.123 --> 05:01.344
except for this house, and
insurance paid for most of it.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.478
What kind of bougie insurance
covers a mug froster?

05:04.521 --> 05:07.611
Man, I own a bar
and I don't even have that.

05:07.655 --> 05:10.353
Well, that's because I got
real insurance.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.138

at the swap meet.

Hollywood.

at you, Hollywood.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.683
No, I don't have
to call security,

05:35.726 --> 05:37.772
but I might call the IRS
and let 'em know

05:37.815 --> 05:39.948
that them two kids you claim
are not really yours.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.171

Calvin and Tina's party.

but we need to talk.

Oh, God, what did I do?
What did I forget?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.223
Can I just pre-apologize,
so we can go to the party?

freaky thing you're into,

that Grover's been watching

08:00.305 --> 08:01.959
these twerking videos, and now

08:02.003 --> 08:03.700
I have to have
a real sex talk with him.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.920
Oh.And I was hoping
to run some ideas by you,

08:05.963 --> 08:08.183
since presumably you've had
to do it twice.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.664
[chuckles]
More like six times.

08:10.707 --> 08:14.015

that people would engage

08:14.058 --> 08:15.973
in such "inappropriate

08:16.017 --> 08:18.106
and unsanitary behavior."

08:20.717 --> 08:22.327
Well, look,
I'm just trying to avoid it

08:22.371 --> 08:24.068
being awkward
and uncomfortable,

08:24.112 --> 08:27.507
like, like the sex talk
that I had with my dad.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.073
Well, Dave,
you have a way of making

08:29.117 --> 08:30.945
the simplest conversation
awkward.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.209
A lot like the way
this one started.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.560
Look, I know, and I just...

08:37.604 --> 08:38.953
I don't want
to screw up this up.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.216
Look, man.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.348
In this hyper-sexualized world
we live in,

08:43.392 --> 08:46.395
Grover is bound to be exposed
one way or the other,

08:46.438 --> 08:49.267
so you're smart to try
to get ahead of this.

08:49.311 --> 08:52.619
But the most important thing
you can teach him

08:52.662 --> 08:55.056
is to make good decisions

08:55.099 --> 08:57.406
and treat his partners
with respect.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.626
Wow.

08:59.669 --> 09:02.411
You see, that, that was perfect.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.066
Can you be there
when I talk to Grover?

09:07.024 --> 09:10.680
So you want
your neighbor to watch

09:10.724 --> 09:13.814
while you talk
to your son about sex?

09:14.989 --> 09:17.513
No, you're right. That's my
dad's sex talk all over again.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.606
Oh, look, baby,
the Patels sent us a gift.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.565
You know,
the neighborhood is

09:25.608 --> 09:28.002
still talking about the party
and our remodel.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.525
Yeah, I know.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.092
I'm just worried that
showing off our house

09:31.135 --> 09:33.007
may have sent the wrong message.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.617
I mean, Ernie
and the guys

09:34.661 --> 09:36.140
kept saying that
I've gone Hollywood.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.969
And that the Butlers,
we all Bel Air bougie now.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.362
[groans]

09:41.537 --> 09:43.191
Baby, they're just
busting your chops.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.497
They didn't mean it.

09:45.541 --> 09:48.022
Mama, can I have
another espresso macchiato

09:48.065 --> 09:50.111
from your Italian coffee maker,
please?

09:51.765 --> 09:53.897
I love how it steams
the milk all light and foamy.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.507
Oh, okay.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.466
Oh, you want one,
Marty?

09:57.509 --> 09:59.337
Uh, I guess, although last time

09:59.381 --> 10:01.165
the steamed milk was light

10:01.209 --> 10:03.341
but it was not
particularly foamy.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.126
No.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.954
Not bougie at all.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.566
So why aren't y'all drinking
the coffee at your own place?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.176
'Cause you got all
the good stuff.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.352
And we need it especially
after playing poker

10:14.396 --> 10:16.006
at Ernie's all night long.Yeah.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.747
Ernie had a poker night?

10:17.791 --> 10:19.357
Well, yeah, Dad,
all the guys were there.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.098
We figured you were busy
at the shop.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.883
No. I wasn't invited.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.493
You see, Tina?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.495
Baby, they probably just forgot.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.366
No, they didn't forget.

10:28.410 --> 10:31.065
They think I've changed, like
I'm not one of them anymore.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.589
[stammers] No, no, look,
for what it's worth, Pop,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.418
we did have your back when
the guys were clowning you.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.289
You did?BOTH: Yeah.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.987
'Cause they was
going in on you, Pop!

10:40.030 --> 10:43.033
Yo, Ernie said
you are so siditty,

10:43.077 --> 10:44.774
you now pronounce
your name

10:44.818 --> 10:47.342
[French accent]:
Cal-veen Boot-lar!

10:49.039 --> 10:50.693
[both laughing]

10:50.737 --> 10:52.042
Ah!

10:52.086 --> 10:53.435
[both clearing throats]

10:55.219 --> 10:57.178
After a couple hours
of clowning you,

10:57.221 --> 10:59.441
we was like, "That's my
daddy, come on, now, like..."

10:59.484 --> 11:01.617
That's what you did?

11:01.661 --> 11:02.923
Yeah.Yeah, we did.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.011
Okay, well, Cal-veen

11:04.054 --> 11:06.056
says get your own damn coffees.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.449
No, Daddy, no...

11:08.885 --> 11:10.670
Mmm, this isfoamy.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.678
Tina?Mm-hmm.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.331
I was looking
at that bidet

11:20.375 --> 11:22.899
and realized
this is all your fault.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.641
My fault? How is this my fault?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.295
Well, you're the one
that invited people

11:27.338 --> 11:28.905
over to our new abode and...

11:28.949 --> 11:30.994
Did I just say "abode"?

11:32.953 --> 11:34.476
What have you done to me?

11:34.519 --> 11:36.521
You know what,
maybe I have changed.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.872
Baby, you haven't changed.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.439
You just now have a house
that's tailored to your taste.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.572
They'll come around.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.314
No, this is how it starts, Tina.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.272
First you're not invited
to poker.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.535
Then you're shunned
by your whole community.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.407
Eventually your only friend

11:52.450 --> 11:54.409
is a recliner named Renata.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.761
Yeah, I knew you would name it.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.722
Babe, the way
she cradles me in her lap...

12:02.765 --> 12:05.376
just calling her "chair"
felt rude.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.945
Don't make me rip out
her stuffing.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.949
Look, baby, you're just
overreacting about all of this.

12:12.993 --> 12:16.474
Our community still looks
to you as a leader.

12:16.518 --> 12:19.826
No, babe,
not if they can't relate to me.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.784
They're starting
to pull away, Tina.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.743
Because they think...

12:23.786 --> 12:25.657
they think I'm the new Omarosa.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.835
Okay.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.924
All right, no, how about this,
why don't you invite

12:30.967 --> 12:32.839
the guys over to watch a game?

12:32.882 --> 12:35.363
You can talk a lot of trash
and prove to them

12:35.406 --> 12:37.234
that you're still
the same old Calvin.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.759
[British accent]:
Splendid idea!

12:40.934 --> 12:43.023
This house got me saying
"splendid"

12:43.066 --> 12:44.546
with a British accent.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.374
Yeah.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.505
You know what, now I'm peeved.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.682
You know what, damn it,
I'm gonna just stop talking.

12:53.511 --> 12:56.819
Which is why the most
important thing is consent.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
You know, you never want
to make anyone do something

12:58.865 --> 13:00.388
that they're not
comfortable with.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.259
Well, you make me
clean my room.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.783
I didn't consentto that.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.527
Well, that's your mom, not me.

13:09.571 --> 13:12.835
Now, let's talk
about those twerking videos.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.838
It is completely normal
for you to want to watch them.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.102
Oh, good, but why can't
I stop watching them?

13:20.582 --> 13:22.410
That's a good question.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.412
Uh, well...

13:24.455 --> 13:26.806
Grover, we have
these things called hormones.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.069
Uh, which are...

13:29.112 --> 13:31.462
you know, little guys that
bounce around inside your body

13:31.506 --> 13:34.683
and... make you want
to buy engagement rings

13:34.726 --> 13:37.991
and... be nice to passive-
aggressive mother-in-laws.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.516
What?

13:42.865 --> 13:45.259
No, I get it, I get it,
it's-it's complicated.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.695
Luckily...

13:46.738 --> 13:48.175
I've written a song.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.219
Oh, no.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.963
[laughter, clamoring]

13:54.007 --> 13:55.573
See, what'd I tell you, man?

13:55.617 --> 13:58.315
Just a regular old game night
with the regular fellas.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.274
Yeah, all right.Yeah!

14:00.317 --> 14:01.797
Thanks for having
us over, Calvin.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.234
This new 4K TV
is no joke.

14:04.278 --> 14:07.063
The Lakers look like they're
actually in the living room.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.500
ALL:
Oh!

14:09.544 --> 14:10.675
I thought Durant was

14:10.719 --> 14:11.807
actually gonna kick me.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.417
[laughter, clamoring]

14:13.461 --> 14:15.376
Ooh, LeBron on a breakaway.
There he go!

14:15.419 --> 14:16.899
Boom!

14:16.943 --> 14:18.858
[cheering, clamoring]

14:20.990 --> 14:22.862
Uh... Malcolm did it.

14:22.905 --> 14:23.950
What?
Malcolm did it.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.603
Ernie did it.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.649
[stammers]
Do not point your finger at me.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.390
Okay, all right, guys,
come on, now.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.870
Accidents happen.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.915
Ain't nothing a few napkins
can't take care of.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.091
Here you go, just get that.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.006
Are you okay?I'm okay.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.442
Yeah.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.619
Ernie?Hmm?

14:41.663 --> 14:44.405
Old buddy, you mind, uh,
taking your feet off my ottoman?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.233
It's an ottoman.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.104
Isn't that where you're supposed
to put your feet?

14:48.148 --> 14:51.325
Not when it's made out
of Bolivian bovine, no.

14:51.368 --> 14:54.284
Oh, I thought you said
make ourselves at home,

14:54.328 --> 14:56.112
Hollywood.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.766
[laughter]

14:57.809 --> 14:59.811
You're right, you're right.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.467
Mi casa, su casa.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.513
Yeah.Well, in that case...

15:05.556 --> 15:07.036
[electricity buzzes]ALL: Oh!

15:07.080 --> 15:09.821
I'm sorry, I think
I broke your remote.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.954
That wasn't
just a remote!

15:11.998 --> 15:13.913
That was a new smart-house,
multi-platform,

15:13.956 --> 15:15.349
touch-screen keypad.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.394
My bad, Hollywood.

15:17.438 --> 15:20.223
But if it was so smart, it
should've moved out of the way.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.746
[laughter]

15:21.790 --> 15:24.140
Move... get out the way!Get out the way!

15:24.184 --> 15:26.534
You know what, that's it!

15:26.577 --> 15:28.492
You know what, I'm tired
of y'all thinking I'm different

15:28.536 --> 15:30.103
because of my house.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.322
Yes, it's beautiful.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.542
And, yes, I'm proud of it,
but just like y'all,

15:34.585 --> 15:36.413
I work hard to have what I have.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.025
Now get your Sasquatch feet
off my ottoman!

15:39.068 --> 15:40.896
Hey, uh... [clears throat]

15:40.940 --> 15:42.463
I think what my pops
is trying to say is,

15:42.506 --> 15:43.855
please respect his space.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.466
CALVIN:
I-I'm sorry,
was I not clear?

15:45.509 --> 15:47.250
What I'm saying is...

15:47.294 --> 15:48.817
get the hell out of here!

15:48.860 --> 15:50.688
Go! Everybody...You talking to me?

15:50.732 --> 15:52.734
Put the cup down, Ernie,
put the cup down.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.692
You know that,
and don't try to get no salsa,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.390
don't try to take no chips.
Everybody, go.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.306
You know, I got to say,

15:59.349 --> 16:01.961
you're starting to feel
like the old Calvin again.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.571
Oh, you miss the old Calvin?

16:03.614 --> 16:04.702
Yeah, man.

16:04.746 --> 16:05.747
Well, this is gonna
warm your heart.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.320
So, you see, there's these
things called hormones.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.670
And they make you want
to buy expensive stuff.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.716
And you need consent,
but not when it comes

16:18.760 --> 16:20.762
to cleaning your room
or eating broccoli.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.808
Well, you know, it makes
more sense if you sing it.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.636
So the song is
basically about...

16:25.680 --> 16:28.204
♪ Touching and rubbing

16:28.248 --> 16:30.163
♪ And putting... Thank you for sharing, Grover.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.295
But I believe
they've heard enough.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.908
What were you thinking?

16:36.952 --> 16:39.085
Every kid on the playground
is singing about sex,

16:39.128 --> 16:41.043
like it's
a fun Taylor Swift song.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.002
What do you have
to say for yourself?

16:46.788 --> 16:49.399
Did they really compare
my songwriting to Taylor Swift?

16:51.619 --> 16:54.317
Okay, I'm sorry...

16:54.361 --> 16:56.972
Ms. Johnson, but can we please
talk about this at home?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.930
No, because I'm not
your wife right now.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.758
I am your son's principal.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.717
Okay, well, in my defense,

17:02.760 --> 17:04.719
how do you explain hormones?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.329
I mean, nobody knows
what those things are.

17:06.373 --> 17:09.202
They're our bodies'
chemical messengers.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.509
Ooh, that's good, I got
to add that to my sex talk song.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.729
What rhymes with messenger?

17:14.772 --> 17:17.253
Got it. "Sex with her."

17:19.299 --> 17:20.996
Dave, Grover needs

17:21.040 --> 17:22.824
real information about sex.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.739
Yeah, I know...
you're right.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.741
I overthought it. I just,
I didn't want it to be

17:26.784 --> 17:28.482
like the sex talk
I had with my dad.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.440
Everything was
a power tool reference.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.052
I still feel dirty
walking around the Home Depot.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.275
Okay, so...

17:39.319 --> 17:40.798
what does this thing do again?

17:40.842 --> 17:42.583
It's a convection oven.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.541
It can braise, roast and toast.[doorbell rings]

17:44.585 --> 17:47.196
Isn't that
what a regular oven does?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.546
Well, this one convections.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.070
Oh.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.810
Well, that clears that up.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.292
Oh, hey, Ernie. Come on in.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.598
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.208
CALVIN:
Oh, quick, Tina.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.992
Hide the Grey Poupon

18:01.036 --> 18:02.820
before Ernie accuses me of being

18:02.864 --> 18:04.735
a mustard elitist.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.130
[chuckles]

18:08.174 --> 18:10.785
Actually, that's why I'm here.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.613
I want to apologize

18:12.656 --> 18:15.006
for all the snide comments
and rude jokes.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.618
You didn't deserve that.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.142
Yeah, man, I mean,
we've always kidded around,

18:20.186 --> 18:23.667
giving each other a hard time,
but... this felt different.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.844
I'm embarrassed to admit it,
but I was jealous.

18:26.888 --> 18:30.152
I had a bad year at the bar.
I'm two months behind

18:30.196 --> 18:32.067
on rent and I...

18:32.111 --> 18:33.721
might have to shut down.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.724
But-but I still
shouldn't have taken

18:36.767 --> 18:38.639
my frustrations out on you.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.729
I'm sorry.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.731
Wow, man.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.950
I didn't know.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.996
Look, apology accepted.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.476
Thanks.
So...

18:49.519 --> 18:51.347
why don't you stay
and have some dinner with us.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.610
Well, I have good timing.
[chuckles]

18:53.654 --> 18:55.090
Can I get you a beer?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.613
Oh, could I get one
of them frosted mugs?

18:56.657 --> 18:58.180
Oh, you ain't said
nothing but a word.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.529
Ah...

18:59.573 --> 19:01.836

Oh, uh, Ernie,
before you go,

19:16.242 --> 19:18.505
um, there's something
that we wanted to give you.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.637
What's this?
Look, man,

19:20.681 --> 19:23.510
I'm not a rich man,
but I am a blessed one.Yes.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.425
And as a small
business owner,

19:25.468 --> 19:27.818
I know how tough times can be.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.212
But even more importantly,
man, you're my boy.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.519
So I know you would do
the same for me.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.740
Aw...

19:36.784 --> 19:38.133
Hey, look...

19:38.177 --> 19:40.004
Thank-thank you,
but I-I can't take this.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.572
Oh...You can and you will.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.228
I appreciate it.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.362
Yeah, besides, man,
that right there, that's a loan.

19:49.405 --> 19:52.103
Don't think your boy out here
giving away free money.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.845
[laughs] Now, that
is the old Calvin.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.412
Yeah.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.935
Hey, thanks, you two.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.676
And I promise I will
repay this loan

19:59.720 --> 20:01.504
when I can.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.027
And when you do,
make sure you give me

20:03.071 --> 20:04.464
that other $40 you owe me.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.422
[laughs]:Yeah!

20:11.906 --> 20:14.343
And that's
how things really work.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.389
Wow!

20:18.391 --> 20:20.349
So, now that you have
this information,

20:20.393 --> 20:21.785
if you share it
with your friends,

20:21.829 --> 20:23.265

20:23.309 --> 20:26.268
Oh, don't worry. I'd never
talk to my friends about this.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.836
Now that I know how
disgusting it is, count me out.

Well, that went well.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.582
