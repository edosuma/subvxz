WEBVTT

04:13.754 --> 04:15.756
No, nothing.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.051
- Really?
- Yes!

04:50.165 --> 04:52.167
Hey, wombie.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.420
Have you seen my score
for the Saint-Saëns?

04:54.503 --> 04:55.796
It's not in my folder.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.756
Why would I know
where your music is?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.633
I don't know.

04:59.717 --> 05:02.469
Sorry for daring
to ask a question.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.887
Are you done?

05:03.971 --> 05:06.348
I need to borrow your phones.
Mine are fucked.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.768
Not like I'm getting
anything done anyways.

05:09.852 --> 05:13.313
You know what they say.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.316
"Whoo-hoo. Spring break."

05:16.400 --> 05:18.152
I'll be in my room.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.071
Welcome.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.531
No, no, no, wait.
You have to go north.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.657
They have these
amazing vineyards.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.950
It's, like, this wine country...

05:25.034 --> 05:26.285
Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.037
Uh, right next to Venice.
What's it called?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.788
- The Veneto.
- Well, that is an option.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.457
- That's an option.
<i>- Il Veneto.</i>

05:31.540 --> 05:34.043
You got to get it right. Yes.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.629
Oh, hey.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.799
Juju, sweetheart, you girls
finished practice already?

05:40.883 --> 05:42.259
Uh, Vi's still going.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.594
Juliet's our youngest.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.054
Oh, I thought you had twins.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.388
Two minutes apart.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.182
Someone has to hold the door.
Right?

05:49.558 --> 05:51.351
But we heard your news.
Juilliard.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.187
Congrats. That's incredible.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.564
Uh, you're thinking
of my sister Vi.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.316
She's going to Juilliard
next year.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.234
Julie is taking the gap year
to consider her options.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.695
That's smart.
You know what, I have a cousin.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.238
He did fine arts,
college, everything.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.449
Eight years later,
he's teaching preschoolers

06:05.532 --> 06:07.826
how to make things out of
<i>washi</i> tape. - Hey.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.369
-Crafts are important.
-I'm just saying,

06:09.453 --> 06:10.662
there's eight billion people
on this planet,

06:10.746 --> 06:12.206
and everybody wants to have

06:12.289 --> 06:13.999
their moment in the spotlight,
and it's not gonna happen.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.584
The Instagram generation
needs to be more realistic

06:15.667 --> 06:17.961
about long-term
career prospects.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.006
I don't have social media, so...

06:21.090 --> 06:22.132
- See?
- Oh, good.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.217
That's a start.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.927
Dad, what time
are we leaving tomorrow?

06:25.010 --> 06:26.637
-Oh, whenever you want.
-They're at boarding school.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.889
- Lindberg Academy.
- The arts school?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.516
Isn't that where that girl...?

06:32.101 --> 06:33.519
It's fine.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.270
I didn't really know her.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.650
Okay, hey, sweetie,
make sure you got

06:39.733 --> 06:40.943
everything ready for tomorrow.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.194
Okay.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.654
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye, guys.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.116
Um... okay.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.159
So, what was...
I'm sorry, what was that place?

07:30.409 --> 07:33.036
Max! Max!

07:33.120 --> 07:34.955
-Hi.
-Hey, Vi.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.667
Yeah, no problem, Vi!

07:38.750 --> 07:40.085
Just take your time!

07:40.169 --> 07:41.879
Car will unload itself!

07:41.962 --> 07:43.255
Young love.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.840
A father's waking nightmare.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.258
You got your pills?

07:46.341 --> 07:47.718
All right, look.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.469
I know the Juilliard thing
hit you hard.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.180
And they don't know
what they're missing.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.431
But no, listen to me.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.932
You got a big heart.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.934
You got a beautiful face.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.019
-Dad.
-And no matter what

07:57.102 --> 07:58.687
those artistes
in there tell you,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.231
there's more to life
than solos and spotlights.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.902
And any academic school
would kill to have you.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.112
All right, I'll get your stuff.

08:42.898 --> 08:46.193
Moira Wilson was one of
the finest musicians

08:46.276 --> 08:49.071
ever to grace Lindberg Academy.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.741
For many of you,
what happened here six weeks ago

08:52.824 --> 08:56.161
will be your first
experience of loss.

08:56.245 --> 08:58.747
Moira's passing
is a stark reminder

08:58.830 --> 09:00.499
of the darkness we all face

09:00.582 --> 09:04.878
in our lives
and in our artistic pursuits.

09:04.962 --> 09:08.590
As you all know, Moira was
to deliver the concerto solo

09:08.674 --> 09:11.343
in our Music Showcase
later this quarter.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.345
A long-standing
school tradition,

09:13.428 --> 09:15.764
the senior concerto
has successfully launched

09:15.847 --> 09:19.643
the careers of many Lindberg
graduates over the years.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.396
Following much discussion,
we have decided

09:22.479 --> 09:24.690
to rerun the senior
concerto competition

09:24.773 --> 09:27.234
in her memory.

09:27.317 --> 09:31.363
Music majors of all disciplines
are encouraged to participate.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.408
Submit your repertoire
to Dr. Cask.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.757
So, you orch dorks horny
for Hunger Games round two?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.050
"Orch dorks"? I resent that.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.843
Did you tell him the news?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.428
Who says I don't know the news?

10:36.511 --> 10:37.846
Um, were you in assembly?

10:37.929 --> 10:39.765
Uh, I had shit to do.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.099
They're rerunning the concerto.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.726
In memory of Mad Moira.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.020
Oh, my God, will you stop
calling her that?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.688
She carved symbols all over
the wall and threw herself

10:46.772 --> 10:48.315
out a third-floor window.
Plus, she talked to what,

10:48.398 --> 10:50.150
like, no one
the entire time she was here?

10:50.233 --> 10:51.193
And she was ambidextrous.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.903
And that's relevant because...?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.279
She wrote with both hands.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.365
Inside out,
like Leonardo da Vinci.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.075
The chick was just
new levels of freaky.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.201
She was brilliant.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.996
It's just weird,
the competition.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.915
I mean, she died six weeks ago.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.708
Yeah, it's kind of soon,

11:06.792 --> 11:08.335
but the showcase is
a big opportunity.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.712
I mean, someone else
should get a chance.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.047
Yeah, I heard Juilliard's
sending scouts this year.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.757
- Really?
- And my golden gal

11:13.840 --> 11:16.218
is gonna wow them all again
when she plays her concerto.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.095
It's an open competition.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.679
Oh, come on, you're with Cask.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.807
Best teacher, best student.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.227
Anyways, if you're asking for
my completely unbiased opinion,

11:25.310 --> 11:27.270
it should've been you
the first time around.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.774
Oh, so you pushed her.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.109
- And then...
- Shut up!

11:32.192 --> 11:33.860
And then she's just
born for greatness.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.445
It's all coming together.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.284
You gonna change your entry?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.869
It's too late.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.663
And Roger won't let me.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.289
Oh, you know what I think.
Nobody...

11:46.373 --> 11:49.126
"No one ever won anything
with Mozart."

12:00.345 --> 12:02.931
Jules, I say this lovingly
as your sister:

12:03.014 --> 12:04.349
Grow some balls.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.976
Repeat after me:

12:06.059 --> 12:07.853
Roger Melling,
you are a drunken,

12:07.936 --> 12:09.729
cockless excuse of a teacher...

12:09.813 --> 12:12.607
-Okay, I can't actually
say that, though, can I? -Why?

12:12.691 --> 12:14.443
You're scared
he'll set the claw on you?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.111
Okay, stop.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.489
It's focal dystonia, and it's
common in musicians his age.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.867
The claw.
It's gonna get you.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.748
Hey, you dropped...

13:42.280 --> 13:43.573
Phrasing.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.831
Good. Very good.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.833
I see you managed
to fit in some practice

13:53.917 --> 13:56.628
between all the drugs
and the underage drinking.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.130
I leave the drinking
to the experts.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.924
Very funny.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.386
-They're rerunning the concerto.
-So I hear.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.971
Feeling positive?

14:06.054 --> 14:07.973
I was thinking about
changing my piece.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.850
I've been looking
at Saint-Saëns' 2.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.853
Third movement still needs work,
but I can get there.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.022
-You mean Vivian's piece?
-It's not that hard.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.774
Cask lets Vi play it.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.234
Henry's methods are his own.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.236
I know, but if I just
get the chance...

14:21.319 --> 14:23.905
You'd make a pig's ear of it.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.365
Is that what you want?

14:25.448 --> 14:28.868
Stick with Herr Amadeus.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.913
He will reward you.
He always does.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.383
Uh, Dr. Cask?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.221
My piece for tomorrow.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.117
"Immortal glory awaits she
who in her darkness welcomes me.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.120
"The path required
this book depicts:

17:59.204 --> 18:01.831
one, two, three,
four, five, six."

18:45.625 --> 18:47.544
Tartini.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.673
The composer.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.217
It didn't say the piece.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.135
That's the "Devil's Trill."

18:56.219 --> 18:58.513
By the way, Vivian doesn't know

18:58.596 --> 19:02.183
you're playing
the same piece as her, does she?

19:07.522 --> 19:09.899
Please don't tell her.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.860
She'll kill me.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.697
Break a leg.

20:03.578 --> 20:05.288
Jules, open the fucking door!

20:05.371 --> 20:06.915
Jules, come on!

20:06.998 --> 20:09.000
We're gonna be late! Jules!

20:10.543 --> 20:11.836
Wombie, you owe...

20:11.920 --> 20:13.880
Whoa.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.800
-Fuck.
-Oh, this is hilarious.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.345
Don't you keep, like,
a calendar or something?

20:20.428 --> 20:22.305
No, it wasn't supposed to...

20:22.388 --> 20:23.723
Fuck!

20:24.807 --> 20:26.059
Hey, hey.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.310
Come here. Look at me.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.436
Hey.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.313
Head in the game.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.065
Okay?

20:33.316 --> 20:34.984
Okay.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.570
You're fine. Come on.
Let's tampon and go.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.099
Vi.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.812
-Vi.
-Jules, not now.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.272
Well read, Andy.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.732
Anyone left?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.734
I haven't played.

22:39.817 --> 22:40.818
Juliet.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.361
Come on down.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.282
Come here.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.617
So...

22:47.700 --> 22:50.745
it says here
you're also treating us

22:50.828 --> 22:52.622
to Saint-Saëns.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.500
Is that right?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.299
When you're ready.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.523
Juliet.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.150
Can you hear me?

26:56.157 --> 26:57.616
There she is.

26:59.452 --> 27:00.828
We're waiting on the nurse.

27:00.911 --> 27:01.912
What happened?

27:01.996 --> 27:03.622
You passed out.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.084
How'd I play? Was I good?

27:07.168 --> 27:08.627
You did great.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.255
Roger says you've been taking
propranolol.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.674
-Is that for anxiety?
-Yeah.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.343
You know, with recent events,

27:15.426 --> 27:18.429
you may be feeling
a little destabilized.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.389
Is there anything on your mind?

27:20.473 --> 27:22.600
Odd thoughts?
Troubling thoughts?

27:22.683 --> 27:24.685
No.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.854
Nothing.

27:29.523 --> 27:32.318
So, remember, E-flat major.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.118
An accidental there.

27:42.787 --> 27:45.498
Find where it is.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.545
Same thing again.

27:51.629 --> 27:55.257
And for the finish, do not
forget to name the cadence.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.891
Turn in
your transcriptions to me

28:03.974 --> 28:06.394
by the end of the day,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.648
Juliet, you good?

28:10.731 --> 28:12.775
-You saw the nurse?
-Yeah. It was just nerves.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.151
You know, you played well.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.611
Has Roger got you doing
something different?

28:17.988 --> 28:20.783
No, I, uh, guess
I just felt inspired.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.326
Well, whatever it is,
it's working.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.495
Keep up the momentum, okay?

28:24.578 --> 28:26.247
Okay.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.751
Vi.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.838
Vi, come on.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.178
Vi, stop.

28:41.262 --> 28:42.847
I'm sorry. I fucked up.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.473
I should've told you
I changed my entry.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.058
Changed your entry?
You stole my piece.

28:46.142 --> 28:47.685
What, is something funny?

28:47.768 --> 28:49.311
No, just...

28:49.395 --> 28:52.022
you're the one
who told me to switch.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.899
To Beethoven or Grieg
or freaking Rachmaninoff.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.568
I mean, you literally had
hundreds of options.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.862
-I know. I just, I didn't think.
-No, you didn't.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.613
Because if you had, you'd have
realized the only person

28:59.697 --> 29:01.866
you were embarrassing out there
was yourself.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.659
I already knew you were jealous.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.745
Now, thanks to your little
stunt, everybody else does, too.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.806
That's a really good point.

30:48.889 --> 30:51.350
-Yeah, but they're both
in E major. -Right.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.520
How are you feeling?

30:54.603 --> 30:56.146
Good.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.240
So, you went for
the Saint-Saëns.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.952
You know,

31:10.035 --> 31:14.164
when I suggested that
you stick with the Mozart,

31:14.248 --> 31:16.917
I had your best interests
at heart.

31:18.168 --> 31:20.754
Still, I suppose it's behind us.

31:27.761 --> 31:30.139
-Are you proud of me?
-Proud?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.766
Of course I'm... proud of you.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.603
Four years
we've studied together.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.187
You're a fine player.

31:37.271 --> 31:38.939
Right.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.651
What if I could be more?

31:42.735 --> 31:44.903
I don't follow.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.905
What if I could be
more than fine?

31:46.989 --> 31:48.365
What if I could be great?

31:48.449 --> 31:50.492
What if all I needed
was a chance to compete,

31:50.576 --> 31:51.952
to prove myself?

31:52.036 --> 31:54.079
Julie.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.332
I salute your ambition.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.709
But if we all played
concertmaster,

31:58.792 --> 32:00.502
we'd never have an orchestra.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.796
Now, you're a good player.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.548
I believe in you.

32:04.632 --> 32:07.384
But you have to manage
your expectations.

32:07.468 --> 32:11.180
We can't all be off
chasing concerti.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.931
So, what should I be chasing?

32:13.015 --> 32:14.475
Teaching posts.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.060
Chamber work.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.437
You are a sensitive accompanist.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.564
Schools are always looking.

32:20.648 --> 32:23.442
"A sensitive accompanist"?

32:27.821 --> 32:32.660
I was practicing three hours
a day when I was nine.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.912
I've never owned a PlayStation.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.914
Never smoked a cigarette.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.041
Do you know the average age

32:39.124 --> 32:41.627
people lose their virginity
in this country?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.922
It's 17.

32:45.005 --> 32:49.301
Next month, I will be
a statistical fucking anomaly.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.845
I have given my entire life
to music,

32:51.929 --> 32:54.098
and you think I did it
so I could sit

32:54.181 --> 32:55.683
at some school hall keyboard

32:55.766 --> 32:57.768
eating some seventh-grade
part-timer's shit?

33:03.065 --> 33:04.525
Did you vote for her?

33:05.693 --> 33:07.069
What?

33:07.152 --> 33:09.405
The competition.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.615
Did you vote for Vi?

33:13.117 --> 33:15.077
Vivian...

33:15.160 --> 33:17.329
was the more accomplished
musician.

33:19.415 --> 33:22.167
Now, let's put this behind us.

33:23.252 --> 33:25.212
No.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.256
I've outgrown you, Roger.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.465
Outgrown me?

33:28.549 --> 33:30.467
Don't act dumb.

33:30.551 --> 33:31.969
I know it. You know it.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.762
If you were
a half-decent teacher,

33:33.846 --> 33:36.223
you would've passed me on
a long time ago.

33:36.306 --> 33:37.558
And Juilliard?

33:37.641 --> 33:39.351
My fault, too, is it?

33:39.435 --> 33:41.270
I told you, widen the net.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.189
Northwestern, Oberlin--
you might have made it.

33:44.273 --> 33:47.735
But no, you insisted--
only Juilliard.

33:47.818 --> 33:50.612
Juilliard, with its
six-percent acceptance rate.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.573
It kills you, doesn't it?

33:52.656 --> 33:54.283
That I actually have ambitions.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.827
That I won't just lie down
and become some footnote.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.079
Footnote?
The way you're going,

33:59.163 --> 34:01.832
you'll be the world's first
virtuoso burger flipper.

34:01.915 --> 34:05.335
Better that
than a deformed drunk

34:05.419 --> 34:08.297
who pretends he chose teaching

34:08.380 --> 34:10.674
when he hasn't performed
in public in 20 years.

34:19.933 --> 34:20.893
Julie...

34:30.110 --> 34:31.987
<i>We've opted for suspension.</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:34.572
<i>There will be</i>
<i>an investigation, but, um...</i>

34:34.656 --> 34:37.201
<i>Roger is a superlative teacher.</i>

34:37.284 --> 34:39.077
<i>- We'd hate to act rashly.</i>
<i>- I get it.</i>

34:39.161 --> 34:40.579
<i>You'll need an interim tutor.</i>

34:40.661 --> 34:42.581
<i>I already asked Laura.</i>
<i>She has some space.</i>

34:42.664 --> 34:44.625
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if I could have Dr. Cask.</i>

34:44.708 --> 34:46.835
Henry only works with students

34:46.918 --> 34:50.505
who are truly serious
about a career in music.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.257
I am serious.

35:09.817 --> 35:11.693
<i>Are you getting</i>
<i>these flyers for the end show?</i>

35:11.777 --> 35:13.320
We should go.

35:13.403 --> 35:14.947
I don't know,

35:15.030 --> 35:17.157
but it's good to support.

35:17.241 --> 35:18.617
Got it.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.868
Whatever.

35:19.952 --> 35:21.286
I would, though.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.705
I mean, if that was my sister,
I'd, uh...

35:23.789 --> 35:26.041
Seriously, though,
I feel really bad for her.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.085
Oh, hang on.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.664
Really?

36:47.748 --> 36:49.249
- Whoa. -Really?
- Oh, Jules, Jesus Christ.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.667
Fuck is that?

36:50.751 --> 36:52.502
Tampons, right, Vi?

36:52.586 --> 36:54.212
You're a complete fucking bitch.
You know that, right?

36:54.296 --> 36:55.797
Okay.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.633
Okay, listen. See?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.593
This is good. This is good.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.178
Now we're-we're even.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.888
What do you mean?

37:02.971 --> 37:04.973
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

37:11.104 --> 37:12.439
Wombies.

37:12.522 --> 37:13.941
Together forever, right?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.361
Right.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.615
Hear about Roger?

37:21.698 --> 37:23.575
Yeah. That's some bad karma.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.160
They're putting me with Cask.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.997
Congratulations.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.697
Chromatic scale, from B flat.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.912
In tritones. Both hands.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.544
Okay. First movement.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.257
That's Mozart.

38:22.259 --> 38:25.387
Last time I checked,
you were doing the Saint-Saëns.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.390
Or was that just a stunt
to get on your sister's tits?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.768
Saint-Saëns.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.061
First movement.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.796
Why did you change your piece?

39:01.882 --> 39:04.926
Um... I don't know.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.221
Why did you change your piece?

39:14.644 --> 39:17.981
I wanted to beat her.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.567
Her technique is no better
than yours.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.569
-That's not...
-Take the compliment.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.362
Her technique is no better.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.323
Her efficiency is worse.

39:26.406 --> 39:30.619
So, what makes Vivian the star
and you the...

39:31.745 --> 39:33.163
...whatever you are?

39:35.248 --> 39:37.793
She plays like
the Devil is at the door.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.340
What about Moira?

39:43.423 --> 39:44.758
Moira?

39:44.841 --> 39:47.052
She beat Vi
the first time around.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.137
Is that how she played?

39:52.099 --> 39:55.060
She played like
the Devil was in the room.

39:58.855 --> 40:01.191
Music is a blood sport.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.276
If you really wanted
that spotlight,

40:03.360 --> 40:06.029
you wouldn't let anything
get in your way.

40:06.113 --> 40:08.240
Not even Vivian.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.562
Shit.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.031
<i>She wrote with both hands.</i>

40:50.115 --> 40:51.533
Inside out,
like Leonardo da Vinci.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.162
Holy shit.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.295
"One. Invocation."

41:06.756 --> 41:08.508
"Two.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.719
Assurance."

41:11.553 --> 41:15.515
"Three. Triumph."

41:16.850 --> 41:19.102
"Four. Consummation."

41:23.565 --> 41:27.611
"Five. Purification."

41:31.323 --> 41:33.658
Six...

42:56.283 --> 42:58.410
<i>It's tradition.</i>

42:58.493 --> 43:00.870
I can't.
Vi wouldn't want me there.

43:00.954 --> 43:03.540
-Besides, it's past curfew.
-Sure, she would.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.500
Come on. We're late.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.127
What if they catch us?

43:07.210 --> 43:08.586
Never have yet.

43:12.716 --> 43:15.010
Hey, Max, wait up.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.992
Whoo! What's up,
my man? - Come on.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.493
Hey.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.495
The reinforcements have arrived.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.205
Hey, buenas noches.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.541
What's going on, my guy?

43:46.624 --> 43:49.794
-Something for you.
-Oh. Thank you.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.713
And something for me?

43:51.796 --> 43:53.590
You the man.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.050
Appreciate you.

43:55.133 --> 43:56.468
All right, party people.

43:56.551 --> 43:59.387
Who needs the goods?
The doctor has arrived!

44:07.729 --> 44:09.147
You're a rebel, Jules.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.899
An outcast.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.568
A, uh, guerrilla unit
rising against the tyranny of...

44:13.651 --> 44:15.570
Okay.

45:17.173 --> 45:20.093
Because it's
3:00 in the morning.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.514
It's done, okay?

45:24.597 --> 45:26.558
I'm with Max. I'm, uh...

45:28.726 --> 45:32.480
What part of "it's over"
do you not understand?

45:32.564 --> 45:34.482
Are you serious right now?

45:34.566 --> 45:36.484
No, I-I'm done.

45:36.568 --> 45:38.736
I-I am fucking done fucking you.

45:38.820 --> 45:41.114
And stop calling me.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.327
Vi?

45:46.411 --> 45:48.163
Vi, that you?

45:50.415 --> 45:52.292
Holy shit.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.502
Hey, Jules. You okay?

45:59.716 --> 46:01.759
Can I ask you something?

46:01.843 --> 46:03.595
Why do you play?

46:04.888 --> 46:07.515
Honestly...

46:07.599 --> 46:09.934
it's for the pussy.

46:10.018 --> 46:11.561
Band camp baddies.

46:11.644 --> 46:12.896
Seriously, Max.

46:12.979 --> 46:14.397
I don't know.

46:14.481 --> 46:16.566
I guess I always wanted to.

46:16.649 --> 46:17.817
What about you?

46:17.901 --> 46:19.152
Why'd you start?

46:19.235 --> 46:21.154
-Come on. You've heard this.
-Not from you.

46:25.533 --> 46:28.286
My parents like two things:

46:28.369 --> 46:30.079
expensive vacations...

46:31.539 --> 46:33.958
...and cheesy
Hollywood musicals.

46:34.042 --> 46:36.794
Their favorite's
<i>An American in Paris.</i>

46:36.878 --> 46:39.714
Oscar Levant plays
Gershwin's Concerto in F.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.466
I swear...

46:41.549 --> 46:43.510
I watched that scene, like,

46:43.593 --> 46:47.305
a hundred times between
the ages of four and five.

46:47.388 --> 46:48.806
And then I begged and begged,

46:48.890 --> 46:50.975
and eventually--
probably to shut me up--

46:51.059 --> 46:54.646
my parents started us
in piano lessons.

46:54.729 --> 46:56.523
I was like a penny
in a slot machine.

46:56.606 --> 46:58.525
Everything just made sense.

46:58.608 --> 47:00.193
Vi less so.

47:02.195 --> 47:03.738
Then something happened.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.240
Like what?

47:05.323 --> 47:07.033
She got good, and I didn't.

47:07.116 --> 47:09.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:09.118 --> 47:11.788
No, your audition was fire.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.831
You taking new vitamins?

47:15.458 --> 47:16.960
Uh, I had a good day.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.419
Oh, seriously?

47:22.882 --> 47:24.801
Okay, but...

47:24.884 --> 47:26.886
you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

47:26.970 --> 47:28.221
Especially Vi.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.104
I stole Mad Moira's theory book.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.855
Okay, wait.

47:37.939 --> 47:39.857
-Wait, what?
-No, I-I didn't mean to.

47:39.941 --> 47:41.109
They were cleaning out
her mailbox,

47:41.192 --> 47:42.652
and it dropped to the floor.

47:42.735 --> 47:45.405
I've been reading it,
studying it, I guess,

47:45.488 --> 47:48.199
and it's like
it's talking to me.

47:48.283 --> 47:50.326
Like it's trying to help.

47:50.410 --> 47:52.328
I feel more confident.

47:52.412 --> 47:54.539
Like I'm taking control.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.918
Well, guess we all
have our vices.

48:04.591 --> 48:06.050
What about Vi?

48:07.260 --> 48:09.846
Next year,
you're going to San Fran.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.889
She'll be on the East Coast.

48:11.973 --> 48:14.851
Mm, yeah, we'll...

48:14.934 --> 48:16.686
make things work.

48:18.438 --> 48:20.148
So, you love her?

48:20.231 --> 48:21.608
Sure.

48:21.691 --> 48:23.818
Come on, Jules,
you know the deal.

48:23.901 --> 48:26.112
Love, hate, et cetera.

48:27.488 --> 48:28.948
No, not really.

48:29.032 --> 48:31.367
What, you never been kissed?

48:33.536 --> 48:36.039
Guess we've all been there.

48:37.832 --> 48:40.710
I'd like to be.

48:40.793 --> 48:42.754
Kissed.

48:44.797 --> 48:46.132
Wow.

48:47.383 --> 48:49.135
Um, hey, babe.

48:49.218 --> 48:50.678
What's happening?

48:50.762 --> 48:52.096
Uh, we were just...

48:52.180 --> 48:54.515
-She's my sister.
-Babe, we tried to call you.

48:54.599 --> 48:57.477
-Max was just helping me.
-Jules, save the martyr act.

48:57.560 --> 48:58.686
I've seen the way
you look at him.

48:58.770 --> 49:00.355
And you fucking leading her on

49:00.438 --> 49:02.482
like you don't see her sweating
every time you walk in the room.

49:02.565 --> 49:03.775
Uh, we were just talking.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.735
What planet do you
think I'm on? I saw you.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.570
-Yeah, you saw us talking, Vi.
-I heard everything you said.

49:07.654 --> 49:08.988
-Vi, he's telling the tru...
-What do you mean? Wait...

49:09.072 --> 49:10.323
Vi, what the fuck?

49:21.042 --> 49:23.002
- Vi? -VI: Stop!
- What the fuck was that?!

49:23.086 --> 49:24.921
- Vi!
- Jules, fucking stop!

49:25.004 --> 49:27.423
Baby, I'm sorry!
Listen, nothing happened!

49:27.507 --> 49:29.217
Jules! Stop!

49:29.300 --> 49:31.052
Vi, come back!

49:32.053 --> 49:33.179
Stop!

49:55.368 --> 49:57.620
What the fuck?!

50:02.667 --> 50:04.585
Vi?

50:08.881 --> 50:10.383
-Wait!
-Jules, where...

50:10.466 --> 50:12.468
Where's Vi?

50:21.310 --> 50:23.646
Oh, Jesus.

50:23.730 --> 50:25.314
Vi! Baby?

50:25.398 --> 50:27.066
I'm coming, okay?

50:27.150 --> 50:29.902
Just hang in there, okay?

50:29.986 --> 50:32.488
It'll be all right.

50:32.572 --> 50:34.657
Just t-two seconds, babe.

50:38.911 --> 50:40.580
Vi, baby.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.460
Okay. Okay. It's okay.

50:47.670 --> 50:49.005
Ma...

50:49.088 --> 50:51.007
Max, Max...

50:52.759 --> 50:54.093
Get the others back to bed.

50:54.177 --> 50:56.429
Did you see the light before?

50:56.512 --> 50:57.597
What light?

50:57.680 --> 50:59.640
Hi. Yeah, uh,
I need an ambulance.

50:59.724 --> 51:01.017
Jules, please!

52:34.819 --> 52:35.987
Fuck, Jules.

52:36.070 --> 52:38.406
What happened last night
after Vi fell?

52:38.489 --> 52:40.199
You found us,
told us what happened.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.076
-We headed back to school.
-And Vi?

52:42.159 --> 52:43.494
Juliet.

52:43.578 --> 52:44.996
Principal Gordon
wants to see you.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.423
Hey.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.466
-How's your...
-They're waiting for you.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.517
Ah. Juliet.

53:06.601 --> 53:08.227
Please.

53:08.311 --> 53:11.272
I assume you heard
what happened last night.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.066
Your sister and Max
gallivanting off school grounds.

53:14.150 --> 53:15.818
- Is Vi okay?
- She's fine.

53:15.902 --> 53:17.320
She's suspended.

53:17.403 --> 53:19.780
They'll spend school hours
in isolation.

53:19.864 --> 53:22.158
We've been trying
to get ahold of your parents

53:22.241 --> 53:23.951
ever since
the hospital called us.

53:24.035 --> 53:25.828
Do you know where they might be?

53:25.912 --> 53:29.040
Um, they're in...
they're in Europe.

53:29.123 --> 53:31.250
So, Vi can play?

53:31.334 --> 53:33.544
- Her arm looked...
- Broken. Two places.

53:33.628 --> 53:36.589
Vivian will be taking
a break from piano.

53:36.672 --> 53:38.883
For a while, at least.

53:38.966 --> 53:41.052
-How long?
-Six months.

53:43.095 --> 53:44.639
Juilliard--
she's due in the fall.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.515
There's no rushing
the healing process.

53:46.599 --> 53:49.268
Which leads us
to why you're here.

53:49.352 --> 53:53.564
Rehearsals are too far gone
for us to alter our repertoire.

53:53.648 --> 53:56.651
Henry tells us you've mastered
the Saint-Saëns.

53:59.946 --> 54:01.948
You're offering me the concerto?

54:02.031 --> 54:04.951
You don't have to make
a decision now,

54:05.034 --> 54:09.330
but with your recent progress,
we think you'd do a great job.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.290
I've got finals.

54:11.374 --> 54:13.626
We can get you
some extra practice periods.

54:20.841 --> 54:23.844
Yes.
Yes, I'll-I'll do it.

54:23.928 --> 54:26.889
Well, that's decided.

54:26.973 --> 54:29.141
Andy.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.437
You ready?

54:43.239 --> 54:44.448
Vi!

54:47.576 --> 54:48.953
Congratulations.

54:49.036 --> 54:50.788
She'll never forgive me.

54:51.914 --> 54:53.457
And yet you said yes.

54:54.583 --> 54:56.293
Thank you.

54:59.005 --> 55:00.631
You missed a bit.

55:08.514 --> 55:09.348
Vi.

55:16.188 --> 55:18.024
Come on, Vi, please.

55:48.387 --> 55:51.432
You know what the doc said?

55:51.515 --> 55:54.810
I might never play
the same again.

55:54.894 --> 55:57.855
I'm sorry it had to be this way,
but I didn't break your arm.

55:57.938 --> 55:58.898
No.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.816
You didn't have to.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.193
What are you saying?

56:02.276 --> 56:03.986
You could've called out.

56:04.070 --> 56:06.280
Max said you did for him.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.324
But you let me fall.

56:09.450 --> 56:10.743
Didn't you, Jules?

56:10.826 --> 56:12.745
We used to be so close.

56:12.828 --> 56:15.039
And I knew we'd grown apart--
of course I did--

56:15.122 --> 56:16.540
but I guess I never realized...

56:16.624 --> 56:18.334
I heard you on the phone
last night.

56:18.417 --> 56:19.877
Who were you talking to?

56:21.587 --> 56:23.923
You have no fucking clue
what you're talking about.

56:24.006 --> 56:26.258
I know you cheated on Max.

56:26.342 --> 56:27.802
He has a right to know.

56:27.885 --> 56:31.263
And you'll be the one to
oh-so-selflessly tell him,

56:31.347 --> 56:33.224
won't you?

56:39.730 --> 56:41.315
Something's up with you.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.234
Don't think I can't tell.

56:43.317 --> 56:46.946
Just know, this time, I won't
be there to pick up the pieces.

57:28.863 --> 57:30.823
Hey.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.075
You wanted to talk?

57:33.159 --> 57:35.619
Thanks for meeting me.

57:35.703 --> 57:37.288
Is everything okay?

57:37.371 --> 57:39.456
Not really.

57:39.540 --> 57:41.834
Moira's book.
I told you about it.

57:41.917 --> 57:43.043
I wasn't sure at first,

57:43.127 --> 57:45.045
but after the other night,
I realized--

57:45.129 --> 57:47.548
the things in these pictures,
they're happening to me.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.967
And not just happening;
they're helping.

57:50.050 --> 57:51.552
This is Vi.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.762
And...

57:53.846 --> 57:55.806
that's Roger.

57:57.683 --> 57:59.351
And this is me, I think.

57:59.435 --> 58:02.688
So you're telling me
this book predicts the future?

58:02.771 --> 58:05.482
No, obviously not.

58:05.566 --> 58:07.318
These things happened
to Moira, too.

58:07.401 --> 58:10.613
Did you know she lost her
parents right before she died?

58:10.696 --> 58:14.950
Her mom, she fell off a ski lift
and went into a coma.

58:15.034 --> 58:18.871
And her dad
burnt down their house

58:18.954 --> 58:20.164
with him inside it.

58:20.247 --> 58:21.540
Christ, that's awful.

58:21.624 --> 58:22.958
But psychosis runs in families.

58:23.042 --> 58:24.627
Does it run in schools, too?

58:24.710 --> 58:26.128
Either these things
happened to Moira

58:26.212 --> 58:27.504
and they're happening to me now,

58:27.588 --> 58:29.590
or I'm going crazy
just like her.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.759
Okay. Nobody crazy
thinks they're crazy.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.469
But let's logic this out.

58:33.552 --> 58:36.305
Moira suffered some pretty
horrific personal tragedies.

58:36.388 --> 58:39.058
She couldn't talk about them,
so she drew them.

58:39.141 --> 58:40.893
Art therapy's a thing.

58:40.976 --> 58:43.437
Don't you think it's more likely
you saw these images

58:43.520 --> 58:46.315
and now you're projecting them
into everyday life?

58:46.398 --> 58:47.650
Subconsciously.

58:47.733 --> 58:48.901
The concerto's in two weeks.

58:48.984 --> 58:50.903
You got finals coming up.

58:50.986 --> 58:53.072
You're tweaking the fuck out,
Jules.

58:53.155 --> 58:55.241
I know.

58:55.324 --> 58:56.825
I'm sorry.

58:56.909 --> 59:00.537
I just... I don't know who else
to talk to right now.

59:00.621 --> 59:02.539
Actually...

59:02.623 --> 59:05.000
I need to tell you something.

59:07.753 --> 59:09.088
Can we please
just talk about it?!

59:09.171 --> 59:10.547
It's done! It's done!

59:10.631 --> 59:12.258
Can you speak freaking English
for, like, two seconds?

59:12.341 --> 59:13.509
Can you just pay some attention?

59:13.592 --> 59:15.094
Like, you're not even listening!

59:15.177 --> 59:17.137
What the hell?!
I have been paying attention!

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.161
Two days.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:23.620
You nervous?

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:33.297
If you need anything.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.641
It's our birthday tomorrow.

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:47.353
Our parents are back.
They're taking us to dinner.

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:49.271
Many happy returns.

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.565
Are you free?

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:41.073
Whoa. Hey, it's me.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.786
Door was open.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.329
You okay?

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:50.499
I... I don't think so.

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:00.676
Okay.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.266
Where's Vi?

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.226
I don't know.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.228
Actually, we...

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.231
We broke up.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.953
Good.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.644
Come on.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.203
Oh, shit.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:52.496
No, no, no.

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:55.874
What's wrong?

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.627
Sorry.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.963
This was a bad idea.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.802
Max.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:35.956
Make a wish.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:40.252
<i>We were so amazed</i>
<i>to hear Juju's news.</i>

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:43.672
I mean, gutted for Vi,
of course. - Mm.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:46.133
But, I mean,
the last time Julie played

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.968
a solo in public was...

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.803
-second grade?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.972
When their first teacher
gave Juju a solo

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.432
at a concert and she...

01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:54.891
I never played solo with Gwen.

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:57.561
No, yes, you did. You did.
Some gavotte.

01:04:57.644 --> 01:04:59.396
Anyway, the poor thing
went out to play,

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:00.689
-and she just...
-Can we not?

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:07.988
Uh, so, uh, Henry, uh,

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.157
the girls tell us
you have had quite the career.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.202
What was it you played with?
The Berlin... something?

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:16.079
I appeared Berliner.
Moscow, London.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:17.456
Now I'm here.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:19.499
The, uh, caretaker
of a new generation.

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.254
- Did I miss the punch line?
- No, it's just...

01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:25.714
"New generation."

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.257
Classical music.

01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:29.426
The stats aren't promising,
are they?

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:30.886
- Cass, shh.
- No, please.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:33.055
Go on. A little debate
never hurt anyone.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.098
What stats do you mean?

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:38.018
Well, um, you know,

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.563
live audiences--
shrinking, aging.

01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.231
Only one and a half percent

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:46.151
of music streamed online
is classical.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.903
N-Now, now, don't get me wrong.

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:49.529
I mean, the girls
chose this path,

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.156
and we see how hard they work,

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.866
and, well,
we think it's amazing.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.786
-Yeah.
-But you have to wonder,

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.788
with the way things are going,
in the next ten years,

01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:59.831
is there gonna be anybody left
to listen to them?

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.463
Have you ever heard
of the composer Tartini?

01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:09.049
The "Devil's Trill."

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:12.260
Tartini was a violinist.

01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:14.721
One day, he wakes
to find a devil

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.598
sat upon the end of his bed.

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:18.934
<i>The</i> Devil, fiddle and all.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:21.144
He asks the creature
what he's doing there.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:23.980
And Satan says that
he will teach him a melody

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:28.026
so perfect, so divine

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.654
that he will weep
for its loveliness.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:34.116
All Satan asks in return
is a single soul.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:38.161
Now, when the composer wakes--
for certain, this time--

01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:39.705
the Devil is gone.

01:06:39.788 --> 01:06:42.999
He takes up his pen,
scribbles down some notes.

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:47.462
300 years later, Tartini's work
is largely forgotten.

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.089
All except the "Devil's Trill."

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.549
Well,

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:53.093
lucky for us
the Devil doesn't play piano.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:57.514
Our music isn't easy.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:01.351
You start in preschool,
you give your life to the work,

01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:04.730
and perhaps one day, you'll be
good enough to compete.

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:08.191
When you go see that concert--
the big solo, the concerto--

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.610
that's not just music
you're watching.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.779
It's sacrifice.

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:15.782
And yes, we may live in a world
where people would rather listen

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:18.618
to a half-literate teen
swear in time to a drum machine.

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:22.831
But so long as there are people
who appreciate that sacrifice,

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.292
real music will live on.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.170
Preserved by those
who deserve it.

01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:34.676
Here comes the good stuff.

01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:38.722
Hey. Vi.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.849
- Vi, Vi, get back here.
- Sweetie, what...

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.435
Vivian Lowe,
where do you think you're going?

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:44.936
I'm so sorry, Henry.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.063
I have no idea
what got into her.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:49.524
It's a stressful time
for everyone.

01:07:49.608 --> 01:07:51.443
Are you staying in town?

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:53.653
Yeah, uh, a B and B.

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.363
Um, crap coffee, but...

01:07:55.447 --> 01:07:57.866
-Hey, what's the name of
the place we're staying? -Huh?

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:00.660
Oh, hey, do you have the ticket?

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.078
What ticket?

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:03.538
The valet ticket.

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:05.165
Are you drunk?

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.125
Perhaps I could
drive Juliet back.

01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:09.169
My place is right by the school.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.331
Make any breakthroughs?

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.086
I didn't know you conducted.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:54.381
I won that in Germany.
The Leon München.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.383
-You won the Leon München?
-It was second place

01:08:56.466 --> 01:09:00.178
and 20 years ago, but yes.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.276
So... tomorrow.

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:17.404
Tomorrow.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:23.618
Now, listen, because I'm only
going to say this once.

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:27.247
There is something inside you.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:30.082
A seed of greatness.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.795
And it may not be full-grown,
but it's there.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.215
Now, there are people
out there in the world

01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:38.925
who will try to
convince you otherwise.

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:42.386
So you need to practice
saying this to yourself:

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.724
"I have something."

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:03.199
What are you doing?

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.826
-I thought you...
-You thought wrong.

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:05.952
But you said...

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:07.537
Christ, Juliet.

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:10.123
I was trying to boost your
confidence before the big day,

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.543
not risk my career
making out with a student.

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.380
You find something funny?

01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.383
No.

01:10:20.467 --> 01:10:22.218
It's just...

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:23.511
I know.

01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:25.013
About you and Vi.

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.640
I don't understand.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.475
I saw your number on her phone.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.227
I didn't know it was yours until
you gave it to me yesterday.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:35.941
You were fucking her,
weren't you?

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.199
I did nothing
without her consent.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.201
Anyway, it's over.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:47.911
Then why do you keep
calling her?

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.960
Wow.

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:57.963
You're in love with her,
aren't you?

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:02.050
You know, I used to idolize you,

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:04.511
but you're no different
than Roger.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.681
Just acting like a big man
in this empty house

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:11.267
with your second-place trophy
that you won two decades ago.

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:13.937
And you...

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.065
you wouldn't know anything about
failure, would you, Juliet?

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:19.067
I've had a bumpy ride.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.153
Starting tomorrow,
that's gonna change.

01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:26.700
I mean, you said it.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.576
I have something.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.078
And unlike you or Roger,

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.788
I'm not gonna miss
my chance to prove it.

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.248
I'm gonna be great.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:34.666
Oh, yes?

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.293
Let's name some of
these greats, shall we?

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:40.213
Gould, Ashkenazy, Horowitz.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.465
What do all these names
have in common?

01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:45.135
I don't know.
What do they have in common?

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.512
They didn't go
to arts high schools.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.100
Didn't you ever wonder why

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:54.728
the Perahias and Pollinis
of this world

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:59.399
never sat around winning
school concerto competitions?

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.776
It's because
they jumped that hurdle

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.571
before most people
know how to walk.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:10.660
They were playing world stages
before they could ride a bike.

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:14.622
You're not going to miss your
chance at greatness, Juliet.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:16.833
You already have.

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:24.049
That's not true.

01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:26.092
I'm not like you.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:27.677
No.

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:31.765
You don't even have the trophy.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:38.438
You bitch.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.689
Get out!

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.215
You're last in the first half.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.342
Unfortunately,
Henry won't make it.

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.386
He called in sick.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.096
I'm sure everything is fine.

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.390
Just letting you know.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:14.570
Good evening.

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:17.115
Thank you all
for being here tonight.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.993
For our senior music class,
tonight represents

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.453
the culmination
of an artistic journey

01:16:22.537 --> 01:16:25.873
which has lasted
four years here at Lindberg.

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:29.377
And so, without further ado,

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.339
I cede the stage
to our first performer.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.869
Come in.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.996
I was beginning to wonder...

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.168
Hey, wombie.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.008
Max told me what happened.

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:32.815
What did I do
to make you hate me, Jules?

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:35.485
Where'd I screw up?

01:17:39.197 --> 01:17:41.032
Second grade?

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:43.534
Your solo with Gwen--
you remember?

01:17:44.619 --> 01:17:46.287
Mom did.

01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.915
You were so excited.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.293
The night came,
you walked out there,

01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:55.088
and you froze.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.423
Like a little rabbit
in headlights.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.926
Mom and Dad couldn't get you
to leave the stage,

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:02.095
so I went up there.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:07.475
I went up there,
and I took your hand,

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:09.685
and I told you...

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:12.939
Do you remember what I told you?

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:19.529
I told you I would always
be there for you.

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:25.201
I mean, maybe I wasn't always
the nicest sister,

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.954
but I made good on that promise.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:32.500
And in return,
you took my teacher,

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.420
my boyfriend, my future.

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:38.339
Do you know how hard
I worked for Juilliard?

01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:39.924
What I sacrificed?

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:42.301
And you just took it away.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:44.220
And for what?

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:45.721
What, because I'm better
than you?

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:47.306
Were.

01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:51.227
You were better than me.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.064
But I'm playing that stage
tonight.

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:57.275
Are you kidding?

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.110
You're the understudy.

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:01.946
We'll see what the scouts
from Juilliard say

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:05.408
when this understudy walks out
onstage in ten minutes' time.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.788
Wait, you think
Juilliard scouts are here?

01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:13.249
I know they are.
Alexis said...

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.126
Alexis is a moron.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:16.586
Juilliard doesn't
send out scouts.

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.546
It's the best arts school
in the world.

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:21.174
It doesn't need to.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:23.342
Oh, Jules, you thought
this would change things.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:25.219
Stop messing with my head.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:26.762
I don't need to mess
with your head,

01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:28.639
because here's the thing:

01:19:28.723 --> 01:19:30.683
You could walk
out there tonight and play

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.728
the greatest performance ever
seen in the history of music,

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:36.063
and it won't change a thing.

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.857
You'll still be Juliet Lowe,

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.027
and you'll still have
nowhere to go next year.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.072
We're both failures, you and me,

01:19:45.156 --> 01:19:47.533
but at least I have an excuse.

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:50.161
You're just mediocre.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:01.672
Good luck out there.

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.551
I have something.
I have something.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.554
I have something.

01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:51.305
Juliet, it's time.

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:17.164
Give 'em hell, Juliet.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:39.812
See you out there.

01:23:52.987 --> 01:23:54.613
Juliet.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.407
What's going on?

01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:06.407
Juliet.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.200
You're a star.

01:28:15.124 --> 01:28:16.959
Yes.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:20.629
I am.
