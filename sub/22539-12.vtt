<i><font color="#808080">NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON :</font>
Once there was a world...</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:11.725
<i>...not so very different from our own.</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:24.199
<i>There were occasional natural catastrophes,
massive volcanic eruptions...</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:25.826
<i>...and every once in a while...</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:29.705
<i>...an asteroid would come barreling
out of the blue to do some damage.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.207
<i>But for the first billion years or so...</i>

00:33.617 --> 00:37.167
<i>...it would have seemed like a paradise.</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:40.799
<i>This is what we think the planet Venus
might have looked like...</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:43.802
<i>...when our solar system was young.</i>

00:44.253 --> 00:48.508
<i>Then, things started
to go horribly wrong.</i>

02:50.921 --> 02:54.425
The planet Venus, which once
may have seemed like a heaven...

02:54.591 --> 02:56.264
...turned into a kind of hell.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.555
The difference between the two
can be a delicate balance...

02:59.721 --> 03:02.019
...far more delicate
than you might imagine.

03:02.182 --> 03:06.813
Once things began to unravel,
there was no way back.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.780
This is what Venus...

03:08.939 --> 03:11.692
...our nearest planetary neighbor,
looks like today.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.373
<i>Venus' oceans are long gone.</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:30.796
<i>The surface is hotter than a broiling oven,
hot enough to melt lead.</i>

03:30.961 --> 03:32.008
<i>Why?</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:34.183
<i>You might think it's
because Venus is 30</i>

03:34.195 --> 03:36.220
<i>percent closer to the sun
than the Earth is...</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:38.727
<i>...but that's not the reason.</i>

03:38.885 --> 03:42.355
Venus is completely covered
by clouds of sulfuric acid...

03:42.514 --> 03:45.734
...that keep almost all the sunlight
from reaching the surface.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.736
That ought to make Venus
much colder than the Earth.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.320
So why is Venus scorching hot?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.656
It's because the small amount of sunlight
that trickles in through the clouds...

03:55.819 --> 03:59.289
...to reach the surface
can't get back out again.

03:59.448 --> 04:04.045
The flow of energy is blocked
by a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.752
That carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2 for short...

04:07.914 --> 04:11.168
...acts like a smothering blanket
to keep the heat in.

04:11.334 --> 04:15.384
No one is burning coal
or driving big gas-guzzlers on Venus.

04:15.547 --> 04:20.144
Nature can destroy an environment
without any help from intelligent life.

04:20.302 --> 04:24.523
Venus is in the grip
of a runaway greenhouse effect.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.610
<i>Why does it look like we're inside a bowl?</i>

04:28.769 --> 04:32.364
<i>It's due to the intense
atmospheric pressure.</i>

04:33.774 --> 04:36.618
<i>That's the wreck of Venera 13.</i>

04:36.777 --> 04:41.499
<i>In 1982, the scientists and engineers
of what was then the Soviet Union...</i>

04:41.656 --> 04:45.035
<i>...successfully landed this spacecraft
on Venus.</i>

04:45.202 --> 04:48.081
<i>They managed to keep it refrigerated
for over two hours...</i>

04:48.246 --> 04:51.625
<i>...so it could photograph
its surroundings...</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:54.671
<i>...and transmit the images back to Earth...</i>

04:54.836 --> 04:59.307
<i>...before the on board
electronics were fried.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:08.768
Venus and Earth started out
with about the same amount of carbon.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.404
But the two worlds were propelled
along radically different paths.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.362
And carbon was the decisive element
in both stories.

05:16.525 --> 05:20.075
On Venus it's almost all
in the form of gas:

05:20.237 --> 05:23.411
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.289
Most of the carbon on Earth
has been stored for eons...

05:30.455 --> 05:34.301
...in solid vaults
of carbonate rock like this one.

05:34.459 --> 05:38.305
Part of a chain that forms
the celebrated White Cliffs of Dover...

05:38.463 --> 05:40.761
...right on the English Channel.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.933
What titan built
this wonder of the world?

06:00.652 --> 06:05.123
<i>A creature a thousand times smaller
than a pinhead...</i>

06:05.282 --> 06:06.955
<i>...trillions of them.</i>

06:07.117 --> 06:09.290
<i>One-celled algae.</i>

06:13.957 --> 06:17.302
Volcanoes supply carbon dioxide
to the atmosphere...

06:17.460 --> 06:20.464
...and the oceans slowly absorb it.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.928
Working over the course
of millions of years...

06:23.091 --> 06:26.186
...the microscopic algae harvested
the carbon dioxide...

06:26.344 --> 06:28.893
...and turned it into these tiny shells.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.605
They accumulated in thick deposits
of chalk or limestone...

06:32.767 --> 06:34.895
...on the ocean floor.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.493
Later the restless Earth
pushed up the seafloor...

06:41.651 --> 06:45.656
...and carved out these massive cliffs.

06:46.656 --> 06:52.004
Other marine creatures took in carbon
dioxide to build enormous coral reefs.

06:52.162 --> 06:58.215
And the oceans converted dissolved CO2 into
limestone even without any help from life.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.973
As a result only a trace amount was left
as a gas in Earth's atmosphere...

07:03.131 --> 07:06.180
...not even three-hundredths
of 1 percent.

07:06.343 --> 07:12.146
Think of it, fewer than three molecules
out of every 10,000.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.821
<i>And yet it makes the critical difference...</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:23.031
<i>...between a barren wasteland
and a garden of life on Earth.</i>

07:24.110 --> 07:28.616
<i>With no CO2 at all
the Earth would be frozen.</i>

07:30.033 --> 07:34.960
<i>And with twice as many, we're still talking
about only six molecules out of 10,000...</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:40.048
<i>...things would get uncomfortably hot
and cause us some serious problems.</i>

07:40.210 --> 07:43.384
<i>But never as hot as Venus,
not even close.</i>

07:43.546 --> 07:47.972
<i>That planet lost its ocean to space
billions of years ago.</i>

07:48.134 --> 07:51.138
<i>Without an ocean
it had no way to capture CO2...</i>

07:51.304 --> 07:53.898
<i>...from the atmosphere
and store it as a mineral.</i>

07:54.057 --> 07:57.812
<i>The CO2 from erupting volcanoes
just continued to build up.</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:02.070
<i>Today, that atmosphere
is 90 times heavier than ours.</i>

08:02.232 --> 08:05.827
<i>Almost all of it
is heat-trapping carbon dioxide.</i>

08:05.986 --> 08:11.993
<i>That's why Venus is such a ferocious
inferno, so hostile to life.</i>

08:13.201 --> 08:17.547
The Earth, in stunning contrast, is alive.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.087
It breathes...

08:20.875 --> 08:22.468
...but very slowly.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.721
A single breath takes a whole year.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.344
The forests contain most
of Earth's life...

08:27.507 --> 08:30.101
...and most forests
are in the Northern Hemisphere.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.102
When spring comes to the north...

08:32.261 --> 08:36.107
...the forests inhale carbon dioxide
from the air and grow...

08:36.265 --> 08:38.394
...turning the land green.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.860
The amount of CO2
in the atmosphere goes down.

08:42.022 --> 08:46.152
When fall comes and the plants
drop their leaves, they decay...

08:46.317 --> 08:49.617
...exhaling the carbon dioxide
back into the atmosphere.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.202
The same thing happens
in the Southern Hemisphere...

08:52.365 --> 08:54.413
...at the opposite time of the year.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.295
But the Southern Hemisphere
is mostly ocean.

08:57.454 --> 09:02.460
So the forests of the north that control
the annual changes in global CO2.

09:03.126 --> 09:07.006
The Earth has been breathing like this
for tens of millions of years.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.550
But nobody noticed until 1958...

09:09.716 --> 09:12.435
...when an oceanographer
named Charles David Keeling...

09:12.594 --> 09:14.471
...devised a way
to accurately measure...

09:14.637 --> 09:17.811
...the amount of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

09:17.974 --> 09:22.480
Keeling discovered
the Earth's exquisite respiration.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.489
But he also discovered
something shocking...

09:28.651 --> 09:31.825
...a rapid rise,
unprecedented in human history...

09:31.988 --> 09:36.835
...in the overall level of CO2,
one that has continued ever since.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.261
It's a striking departure
from the CO2 levels that prevailed...

09:46.419 --> 09:49.468
...during the rise of agriculture
and civilization.

09:49.631 --> 09:56.105
In fact, the Earth has seen nothing like it
for 3 million years.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.023
How can we be so sure?

09:59.641 --> 10:03.191
<i>The evidence is written in water.</i>

10:11.653 --> 10:17.126
The Earth keeps a detailed diary
written in the snows of yesteryear.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.163
Climate scientists have drilled ice cores
from the depths of glaciers...

10:21.329 --> 10:23.832
...in Greenland and Antarctica.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.836
The ice layers have ancient air
trapped inside them.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.556
We can read the unbroken record
of Earth's atmosphere...

10:32.715 --> 10:36.595
...that extends back
over the last 800,000 years.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.981
In all that time, the amount
of carbon dioxide in the air...

10:40.140 --> 10:43.235
...never rose above
three-hundredths of 1 percent.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.647
That is until the turn
of the 20th century...

10:46.813 --> 10:49.987
...and it's been going up steadily
and rapidly ever since.

10:50.692 --> 10:55.414
It's now more than 40 percent higher
than before the Industrial Revolution.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.246
By burning coal, oil and gas...

10:58.408 --> 11:01.195
...our civilization is
exhaling carbon dioxide

11:01.207 --> 11:04.006
much faster than the
Earth can absorb it.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.293
So CO2 is building up in the atmosphere.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.426
The planet is heating up.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.387
Every warm object radiates a kind of light
we can't see with the naked eye...

11:14.549 --> 11:16.677
...thermal infrared light.

11:16.843 --> 11:21.440
We all glow with invisible heat
radiation, even in the dark.

11:21.598 --> 11:25.068
This is what the Earth looks like
in the infrared.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.531
You're seeing the planet's
own body heat.

11:34.277 --> 11:37.281
<i>Incoming light from the
sun hits the surface.</i>

11:37.447 --> 11:41.577
<i>The Earth absorbs much of that energy
which heats the planet up.</i>

11:41.743 --> 11:45.464
<i>And makes the surface glow
in infrared light.</i>

11:45.622 --> 11:48.176
<i>But the carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere absorbs</i>

11:48.188 --> 11:50.753
<i>most of that outgoing
heat radiation...</i>

11:50.919 --> 11:53.798
<i>...sending much of it
right back to the surface.</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:56.341
<i>This makes the planet even warmer.</i>

11:56.507 --> 11:58.851
<i>That's all there is to
the greenhouse effect.</i>

11:59.010 --> 12:02.935
<i>It's basic physics,
just bookkeeping of the energy flow.</i>

12:03.097 --> 12:05.316
<i>There's nothing controversial about it.</i>

12:05.475 --> 12:08.649
<i>If we didn't have any carbon dioxide
in our atmosphere...</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:12.065
<i>...the Earth would just be
a great big snowball.</i>

12:12.232 --> 12:14.655
<i>And we wouldn't be here.</i>

12:16.778 --> 12:19.702
So a little greenhouse
effect is a good thing.

12:19.864 --> 12:24.620
But a big one could destabilize
the climate and wreck our way of life.

12:24.786 --> 12:28.882
All right,
but how do we know we're the problem?

12:29.040 --> 12:32.294
Maybe the Earth itself
is causing the rise in CO2.

12:32.460 --> 12:36.465
Maybe it has nothing to do
with the coal and oil we burn.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.885
Maybe it's those damned volcanoes.

12:40.051 --> 12:44.682
Every few years, Mt. Etna in Sicily
blows its stack.

12:44.847 --> 12:50.604
Each big eruption sends millions of tons
of CO2 into the atmosphere.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.238
Now, combine that...

12:52.397 --> 12:56.698
...with the output of all the other
volcanic activity on the planet.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.078
Let's take the largest
scientific estimate...

12:59.237 --> 13:05.961
...about 500 million tons of volcanic CO2
entering the atmosphere every year.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.917
Sounds like a lot, right?

13:08.079 --> 13:12.585
But that's not even 2 percent
of the 3O billion tons of CO2...

13:12.750 --> 13:16.471
...that our civilization
is cranking out every year.

13:16.629 --> 13:21.726
And, funny thing, the measured increase
of CO2 in the atmosphere...

13:21.884 --> 13:25.354
...tallies with the known amount
we're dumping there...

13:25.513 --> 13:29.359
...by burning coal, oil and gas.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.396
Volcanic CO2 has a distinct signature.

13:32.562 --> 13:36.317
It's slightly heavier than the kind
produced by burning fossil fuels.

13:36.482 --> 13:40.988
We can tell the difference between the two
when we examine them at the atomic level.

13:41.154 --> 13:45.751
It's clear that the increased CO2
in the air is not from volcanoes.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.082
What's more, the observed warming
is as much as predicted...

13:49.245 --> 13:52.044
...from the measured increase
in carbon dioxide.

13:52.206 --> 13:56.586
It's a pretty tight case.
Our fingerprints are all over this one.

13:56.753 --> 14:00.257
How much is 30 billion tons
of CO2 per year?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.926
If you compressed it into solid form...

14:03.092 --> 14:07.518
...it would occupy about the same the
volume as the White Cliffs of Dover.

14:07.680 --> 14:12.777
And we're adding that much CO2 to the air
every year, relentlessly...

14:12.935 --> 14:14.232
...year after year.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.787
Unlucky for us, the main
waste product of our

14:17.799 --> 14:20.785
civilization is not
just any substance...

14:20.943 --> 14:23.207
...it happens to be the
chief climate-regulating

14:23.219 --> 14:25.494
gas of our global thermostat...

14:25.656 --> 14:28.125
...year in, year out.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.338
Too bad CO2 is an invisible gas.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.124
Maybe if we could see it.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.798
<i>If our eyes were sensitive to CO2...</i>

14:37.960 --> 14:41.134
<i>...and perhaps there are such beings
in the cosmos.</i>

14:41.297 --> 14:44.801
<i>If we could see all that carbon dioxide...</i>

14:44.967 --> 14:47.140
<i>...then we would overcome the denial...</i>

14:47.303 --> 14:51.729
<i>...and grasp the magnitude of our impact
on the atmosphere.</i>

15:05.696 --> 15:10.042
But the evidence that the world
is getting warmer is all around us.

15:10.201 --> 15:13.330
For starters,
let's just check the thermometers.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.169
Weather stations around the world...

15:15.331 --> 15:18.631
...have been keeping reliable temperature
records since the 1880s.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.922
And NASA has used the data
to compile a map...

15:22.088 --> 15:25.262
...tracking average temperatures
around the world through time.

15:26.509 --> 15:32.812
<i>Yellows mean warmer temperatures than the
average for any region in the 1880s.</i>

15:32.974 --> 15:35.568
<i>Orange means hot.</i>

15:37.603 --> 15:40.197
<i>And reds means hotter.</i>

15:40.356 --> 15:44.111
<i>The world is warmer than it was
in the 19th century.</i>

15:47.613 --> 15:51.208
<i>Back then, at the greatest fair
the world had ever seen...</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:55.964
<i>...a forgotten genius demonstrated
the solution to this problem.</i>

15:56.122 --> 15:58.124
<i>Come with me.</i>

16:05.339 --> 16:09.936
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Once there was a world
that was not too hot and not too cold.</i>

16:10.094 --> 16:11.471
<i>It was just right.</i>

16:13.306 --> 16:16.560
<i>Then there came a time
when the life it sustained...</i>

16:16.726 --> 16:20.902
<i>...began to notice our lovely planet
was changing.</i>

16:22.398 --> 16:25.072
<i>And it's not as if we didn't see it coming.</i>

16:28.279 --> 16:34.787
<i>As far back as 1896 the Swedish scientist
Svante Arrhenius calculated...</i>

16:34.952 --> 16:40.334
<i>...that doubling the amount of CO2 in the
atmosphere would melt the Arctic ice.</i>

16:42.418 --> 16:46.218
<i>In the 1930's,
the American physicist E.O. Hulbert...</i>

16:46.380 --> 16:50.101
<i>...at the Naval Research Laboratory
confirmed that result.</i>

16:50.259 --> 16:53.513
<i>So far, it was still just theoretical.</i>

16:54.931 --> 16:58.276
<i>But then the English engineer
Guy Callendar...</i>

16:58.434 --> 17:01.563
<i>...assembled the evidence to show
that both the CO2...</i>

17:01.729 --> 17:05.825
<i>...and the average global temperature
were actually increasing.</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:10.284
Even now, man may be unwittingly changing
the world's climate...

17:10.445 --> 17:12.743
...through the waste products
of his civilization.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.127
<i>Due to our release through factories
and automobiles every year...</i>

17:16.285 --> 17:19.789
<i>...of more than 6 billion tons
of carbon dioxide...</i>

17:19.955 --> 17:22.446
...which helps air absorb
heat from the sun,

17:22.459 --> 17:24.962
our atmosphere seems
to be getting warmer.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.800
This is bad?

17:26.963 --> 17:29.716
Well, it's been calculated
a few degrees rise...

17:29.882 --> 17:33.477
...in the Earth's temperature
would melt the polar ice caps.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.437
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
In 1960, Carl Sagan's PhD thesis...</i>

17:42.603 --> 17:46.574
<i>...included the first calculation
of the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus.</i>

17:46.732 --> 17:50.612
<i>This was part of a career-long interest
in the atmospheres of the planets...</i>

17:50.778 --> 17:52.075
<i>...including our own.</i>

17:52.238 --> 17:56.334
<i>In the original Cosmos series in 1980,
Carl Sagan warned:</i>

17:56.492 --> 17:59.621
<i><font color="#808080">SAGAN :</font> We are releasing vast quantities
of carbon dioxide...</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:02.131
<i>...increasing the greenhouse effect.</i>

18:02.290 --> 18:05.760
<i>It may not take much to destabilize
the Earth's climate...</i>

18:05.918 --> 18:11.095
<i>...to convert this heaven, our only home
in the cosmos, into a kind of hell.</i>

18:16.554 --> 18:20.434
Since Carl spoke those words we've
burdened the atmosphere of our world...

18:20.600 --> 18:25.822
...with an additional 400 billion tons
of carbon dioxide.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.329
And if we don't change
our ways, what will

18:28.341 --> 18:30.702
the planet be like in
our children's future?

18:32.028 --> 18:33.871
<i>Based on scientific projections...</i>

18:34.030 --> 18:39.287
<i>...if we just keep on doing business as
usual, our kids are in for a rough ride.</i>

18:39.452 --> 18:42.376
<i>Killer heat waves, record droughts...</i>

18:42.538 --> 18:46.668
<i>...rising sea levels,
mass extinction of species.</i>

18:46.834 --> 18:52.056
<i>We inherited a bountiful world made
possible by a relatively stable climate.</i>

18:52.214 --> 18:56.515
<i>Agriculture and civilization flourished
for thousands of years.</i>

18:56.677 --> 19:03.310
<i>And now our carelessness
and greed put all of that at risk.</i>

19:04.226 --> 19:08.072
Okay, so if we scientists are so good at
making these dire long-term predictions...

19:08.230 --> 19:12.280
...about the climate, how come we're
so lousy about predicting the weather?

19:12.443 --> 19:16.243
Besides, this year we had
a colder winter in my town.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.126
For all those scientists know,
we could be in for global cooling.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.753
Here's the difference
between weather and climate.

19:23.287 --> 19:28.088
Weather is what the atmosphere does in the
short term, hour to hour, day to day.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.718
Weather is chaotic...

19:29.877 --> 19:32.368
...which means that
even a microscopic

19:32.380 --> 19:34.883
disturbance can lead to
large-scale changes.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.848
That's why those 10-day weather forecasts
are useless.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.354
A butterfly flaps its wings in Bali...

19:40.513 --> 19:43.858
...and six weeks later
your outdoor wedding in Maine is ruined.

19:44.016 --> 19:48.066
Climate is the long-term average
of the weather over a number of years.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.950
It's shaped by global forces that alter
the energy balance in the atmosphere...

19:52.108 --> 19:55.578
...such as changes in the sun,
tilt of the Earth's axis...

19:55.736 --> 19:58.535
...the amount of sunlight
the Earth reflects back to space...

19:58.698 --> 20:01.793
...and the concentration of
greenhouse gases in the air.

20:01.951 --> 20:07.003
A change in any of them affects the climate
in ways that are broadly predictable.

20:07.164 --> 20:13.718
My friend's meandering represents the
short-term fluctuations, that's weather.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.883
It's almost impossible to predict
what will attract his interest next...

20:17.049 --> 20:19.973
...but not hard to know what the range
of his meandering will be...

20:20.136 --> 20:22.889
...because I'm holding him on a leash.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.897
We can't observe climate directly.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.436
All we see is the weather.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.607
But the average weather
over the course of years reveals a pattern.

20:32.773 --> 20:37.119
I represent that long-term trend
which is climate.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.623
Keep your eye on the man, not the dog.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.832
Weather is hard to predict,
like my friend here.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.214
But climate is predictable.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.592
Climate has changed many times
in the long history of the Earth...

20:51.751 --> 20:54.345
...but always in response
to a global force.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.302
The strongest force
driving climate change right now...

20:57.465 --> 21:00.594
...is the increasing CO2
from the burning of fossil fuels...

21:00.760 --> 21:03.138
...which is trapping
more heat from the sun.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.853
All that additional energy
has to go somewhere.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.608
Some of it warms the air.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.769
Most of it ends up in the oceans.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.656
All over the world,
the oceans are getting warmer.

21:14.690 --> 21:19.446
<i>It's most obvious in the Arctic Ocean
and the lands that surround it.</i>

21:22.198 --> 21:28.456
<i>Okay, so we're losing the summer sea ice
in a place where hardly anyone ever goes.</i>

21:28.621 --> 21:31.841
<i>What do I care
if there's no ice around the North Pole?</i>

21:41.050 --> 21:47.057
<i>Ice is the brightest natural surface on the
Earth, and open ocean water is the darkest.</i>

21:47.223 --> 21:50.853
<i>Ice reflects incoming
sunlight back to space.</i>

21:51.018 --> 21:54.147
<i>Water absorbs sunlight and gets warmer...</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:56.111
<i>...which melts even more ice...</i>

21:56.273 --> 22:01.575
<i>...which exposes still more ocean surface
to absorb even more sunlight.</i>

22:01.737 --> 22:04.581
<i>This is what we call
a positive feedback loop.</i>

22:04.740 --> 22:08.961
<i>It's one of many natural mechanisms
that magnify any warming...</i>

22:09.119 --> 22:11.542
<i>...caused by CO2 alone.</i>

22:11.705 --> 22:14.458
We're at Drew Point, Alaska...

22:14.625 --> 22:18.721
...on the edge of the Arctic Ocean.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.606
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> When I was born
the shoreline was a mile farther out...</i>

22:32.768 --> 22:36.818
<i>...and it was breaking off at the rate
of about 20 feet per year.</i>

22:36.981 --> 22:42.863
<i>Now it's being eaten away
at about 50 feet per year.</i>

22:43.028 --> 22:47.283
<i>The Arctic Ocean is warming
and at an increasing rate.</i>

22:47.449 --> 22:50.578
<i>So it's ice-free during more of the year.</i>

22:50.744 --> 22:54.874
<i>That leaves the shore here more exposed
to erosion from storms...</i>

22:55.040 --> 23:00.422
<i>...which are also getting more powerful,
another effect of climate change.</i>

23:00.588 --> 23:05.310
The northern reaches of Alaska,
Siberia and Canada are mostly permafrost...

23:05.467 --> 23:08.846
<i>...ground that has been frozen
year-round for millennia.</i>

23:09.013 --> 23:11.232
<i>It contains lots of organic matter.</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:16.442
<i>Old leaves and roots from plants
that grew thousands of years ago.</i>

23:16.604 --> 23:20.325
<i>Because the Arctic regions are warming
faster than anywhere else on Earth...</i>

23:20.482 --> 23:22.450
<i>...the permafrost is thawing.</i>

23:22.610 --> 23:25.454
<i>And its contents are rotting.</i>

23:25.613 --> 23:28.116
<i>Just like when you unplug
the freezer.</i>

23:31.702 --> 23:36.208
<i>The thawing permafrost
is releasing carbon dioxide and methane...</i>

23:36.373 --> 23:39.798
<i>...an even more potent greenhouse gas
into the atmosphere.</i>

23:39.960 --> 23:42.429
<i>This is making things even warmer...</i>

23:42.588 --> 23:45.808
<i>...another example
of a positive feedback mechanism.</i>

23:45.966 --> 23:49.066
<i>The world's permafrost
stores enough carbon to</i>

23:49.078 --> 23:52.190
<i>more than double the
CO2 in the atmosphere.</i>

23:52.348 --> 23:54.777
At the rate we're going,
global warming could

23:54.789 --> 23:57.229
release most of it by
the end of the century.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.398
We might be tipping the climate
past a point of no return...

24:00.564 --> 24:02.862
...into an unpredictable slide.

24:03.400 --> 24:08.031
Okay, the air, the water
and the land are all getting warmer.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.167
So global warming is really happening.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.544
But maybe it's not our fault.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.500
Maybe it's just nature.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.210
Maybe it's the sun.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.964
<i>No, it's not the sun.</i>

24:22.878 --> 24:26.007
<i>We've been monitoring the sun
very closely for decades...</i>

24:26.173 --> 24:29.473
<i>...and the solar energy output
hasn't changed.</i>

24:29.635 --> 24:34.482
<i>What's more, the Earth is warming
more at night than in daytime...</i>

24:35.140 --> 24:37.734
<i>...and more in winter than in summer.</i>

24:37.893 --> 24:40.737
<i>That's exactly what we expect
from greenhouse warming...</i>

24:40.896 --> 24:44.070
<i>...but the opposite of what increased
solar output would cause.</i>

24:45.192 --> 24:50.574
<i>It's now clear beyond any reasonable doubt
that we are changing the climate.</i>

24:50.823 --> 24:52.917
<i>The sun isn't the problem...</i>

24:53.075 --> 24:57.751
<i>...but it is the solution,
and we've known this for a long time...</i>

24:57.913 --> 25:00.962
<i>...much longer than you might think.</i>

<i>Witness one of the most glorious spectacles
the world has ever seen.</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:28.786
<i>The magnificent head of the Statue
of Liberty has just been completed.</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:39.543
<i>Thousands of exhibitors from around the
planet covered 66 acres of Paris...</i>

25:39.705 --> 25:42.049
<i>...with their inventions and goods.</i>

25:42.207 --> 25:45.131
<i>Edison's first public demonstration
of the light bulb...</i>

25:45.294 --> 25:47.638
<i>...will not take place for another year.</i>

25:47.796 --> 25:50.549
<i>There's no such thing
as electrical appliances.</i>

25:50.716 --> 25:53.845
<i>People don't flick switches
and press buttons.</i>

25:54.011 --> 25:57.732
<i>It's a hand-cranked,
horse-drawn world.</i>

25:59.141 --> 26:03.988
<i>That's the guy we came to see,
the one with the crazy mustache.</i>

26:04.146 --> 26:06.990
<i>He's a math teacher
named Augustin Mouchot.</i>

26:07.566 --> 26:13.118
<i>Remember, it's 1878,
this is a world lit mostly by gaslight.</i>

26:13.280 --> 26:15.408
<i>The automobile is still years away.</i>

26:16.492 --> 26:21.168
<i>But Mouchot here is dazzling the crowd
with his solar power concentrator.</i>

26:23.916 --> 26:26.465
The sun belongs to all of us.

26:26.627 --> 26:33.181
Even though it is 150 million kilometers
away from us, feel its awesome power.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.767
My invention concentrates
the free energy of the sun...

26:36.929 --> 26:39.808
...and converts it into mechanical motion.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.601
It can power any kind of machine.

26:42.768 --> 26:46.864
It can produce electricity
or run a printing press...

26:47.022 --> 26:49.150
...or make ice on a hot day.

You see, my friends,
what wonders we can work...

27:11.797 --> 27:14.391
...if we harness the bounteous energy
of the sun.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.228
The world will someday run out of coal.

27:18.387 --> 27:22.483
But the magnificent sun
will always be there for us.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.916
Mouchot took home
the gold medal from the fair.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.749
But the price of coal tumbled,
becoming so cheap...

27:42.911 --> 27:45.334
...that there was no
interest in solar energy.

27:45.497 --> 27:50.970
Besides, no one understood back then what
the true cost was of burning fossil fuel.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.098
Mouchot's research funding was cut off.

27:54.423 --> 27:58.018
Thirty-five years later,
in the early years of the 20th century...

27:58.177 --> 28:01.272
...another door opened
to an alternative future.

28:01.430 --> 28:05.560

28:30.751 --> 28:33.300
<i>He's only had three years of schooling...</i>

28:33.462 --> 28:37.592
<i>...but his genius for innovation
more than makes up for that.</i>

28:38.175 --> 28:42.806
<i>Before he was 30,
Shuman had invented safety glass.</i>

28:42.971 --> 28:46.726
<i>Its use in automobiles and skylights
saved countless lives...</i>

28:46.892 --> 28:49.691
<i>...and made him a very rich man.</i>

28:50.312 --> 28:53.486
<i>Rich enough to pursue his real passion:</i>

28:53.649 --> 28:55.322
<i>Solar energy.</i>

28:55.484 --> 28:57.737
<i>Shuman led the team
that designed and built...</i>

28:57.903 --> 29:00.998
<i>...an array of solar energy concentrators.</i>

29:01.156 --> 29:04.126
<i>It could power a steam engine.</i>

29:04.910 --> 29:11.259
<i>Shuman is hoping to use the sun's power
to irrigate the desert and turn it green.</i>

29:11.708 --> 29:15.679
<i>The official inauguration
of Shuman's solar power plant in 1913...</i>

29:15.837 --> 29:17.180
<i>...was a dazzling success.</i>

29:20.842 --> 29:27.566
<i>He had invented a practical way to tap the
sun's energy on an industrial scale...</i>

<i>...making solar energy
even cheaper than coal.</i>

29:33.605 --> 29:36.279
<i>The British and German governments
both offered Shuman...</i>

29:36.441 --> 29:39.695
<i>...generous funding to
develop his invention.</i>

<i>It was the ideal source
of abundant power in tropical regions...</i>

29:44.324 --> 29:47.874
<i>...where imported coal
was prohibitively expensive.</i>

29:48.036 --> 29:51.882
<i>But Shuman was dreaming even bigger.</i>

<i>...if deployed in an area of the Sahara
Desert only 150 miles on a side...</i>

30:01.717 --> 30:06.974
<i>...could supply as much power as consumed
by all the industries of the world.</i>

30:07.180 --> 30:08.523
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

30:08.974 --> 30:12.023
<i>The market for a liquid fossil fuel,
petroleum...</i>

30:12.185 --> 30:16.065
<i>...was exploding for shipping,
home heating, cars and trucks.</i>

30:16.231 --> 30:19.235
<i>Oil was abundant, cheaper even than coal...</i>

30:19.401 --> 30:22.075
<i>...and much easier
to get out of the ground and process.</i>

30:22.237 --> 30:25.992
<i>It took 100 men a week
to fuel a ship with coal...</i>

30:26.575 --> 30:30.205
<i>...but with oil one man could do the job
in a single day.</i>

31:07.783 --> 31:12.459

where the winds are strongest.</i>

31:12.996 --> 31:15.920
<i>If we could tap
even 1 percent of their power...</i>

31:16.083 --> 31:19.633
<i>...we'd have enough energy
to run our civilization.</i>

31:32.307 --> 31:35.481
And more solar energy falls
on the Earth in one hour...

31:35.644 --> 31:39.615
...than all the energy our civilization
consumes in an entire year.

31:39.773 --> 31:43.528
If we could harness a tiny fraction
of the available solar and wind power...

31:43.693 --> 31:46.742
...we could supply
all our energy needs forever...

31:46.905 --> 31:50.375

<i>Every one of us
comes from a long line of survivors.</i>

32:08.176 --> 32:10.929
<i>Our species is nothing, if not adaptive.</i>

32:11.096 --> 32:14.316
<i>It was only because our ancestors
learned to think long-term...</i>

32:14.474 --> 32:17.193
<i>...and act accordingly
that we're here at all.</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:19.320
<i>We've had our backs to the wall before...</i>

32:19.479 --> 32:23.029
<i>...and we came through
to scale new heights.</i>

32:23.191 --> 32:26.536
<i>In fact, the most mythic
human accomplishments of all...</i>

32:26.695 --> 32:29.323
<i>...came out of our darkest hour.</i>

32:38.707 --> 32:40.175

Once there was a world...</i>

32:40.333 --> 32:44.634
<i>...rigged with 60,000
hair-triggered nuclear weapons.</i>

32:44.796 --> 32:48.892
<i>The combatants were the two most
powerful countries on earth.</i>

32:49.050 --> 32:51.519
<i>And they were locked in a deadly embrace...</i>

32:51.678 --> 32:55.649
<i>...each vowing that they would rather see
everything we love destroyed...</i>

32:55.807 --> 32:58.731

32:58.894 --> 33:02.740

man-made explosion of all time...</i>

33:02.898 --> 33:06.072

<i>That terror has subsided
to be replaced by new fears.</i>

33:13.074 --> 33:17.045

on earth would be reduced to rubble...</i>

33:22.125 --> 33:25.720
<i>The nuclear rivalry between the
United States and the Soviet Union...</i>

33:26.546 --> 33:29.015
<i>...had another byproduct.</i>

33:29.758 --> 33:33.433
<i>The Apollo missions to the moon
were an extension of the arms race...</i>

33:33.595 --> 33:35.222

33:36.932 --> 33:39.902
<i>Sending people to orbit the Earth
or go to the moon...</i>

33:40.060 --> 33:43.314
<i>...requires big, reliable,
powerful rockets...</i>

33:43.480 --> 33:45.653

technology you need...</i>

33:45.815 --> 33:49.115
<i>...to carry a nuclear warhead
halfway around the planet...</i>

33:49.277 --> 33:52.577

objective for going to the moon.</i>

34:20.308 --> 34:22.310

34:25.688 --> 34:28.283

<i>...as a demonstration of the superior power
and precision of our strategic missiles.</i>

34:34.322 --> 34:38.418
<i>But a funny thing happened to us
on our way to the moon.</i>

34:39.703 --> 34:41.330

<i>For the first time
we inhabitants of Earth...</i>

<i>...could step back and
see it as it really is.</i>

34:51.922 --> 34:58.021
<i>One world, indivisible,
and kind of small in the cosmic context.</i>

34:59.014 --> 35:02.564
<i>Whatever the reason we first mustered
the enormous resources required...</i>

35:02.726 --> 35:04.273
...for the Apollo program...

35:04.436 --> 35:09.033
<i>...however mired it was in Cold War
nationalism and the instruments of death...</i>

35:09.608 --> 35:14.034
<i>...the inescapable recognition
of the unity and fragility of the Earth...</i>

35:14.195 --> 35:16.744

35:16.906 --> 35:19.079
<i>...the unexpected gift of Apollo.</i>

35:19.242 --> 35:22.291
<i>A project conceived in
deadly competition...</i>

35:22.454 --> 35:26.379

35:36.176 --> 35:40.397

35:41.056 --> 35:43.730
It was the lfugao people
of the Philippines...

35:43.892 --> 35:47.021
...working with not much
more than their hands.

35:47.187 --> 35:51.567
About 10,000 years ago
our ancestors all over the world...

35:51.733 --> 35:55.237
...took advantage of another form
of climate change...

35:55.403 --> 35:59.453
...the gentler climate of the intermission
in the Ice Age.

35:59.616 --> 36:03.086
They invented agriculture.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.794
They gave up the ceaseless wandering,
hunting and gathering...

36:06.956 --> 36:10.426
...that had been their way of life
for a million years or so...

36:10.585 --> 36:14.215
...to settle down and produce food.

36:14.381 --> 36:19.854
They found a way to harvest 'IO
to 100 times more solar energy...

36:20.011 --> 36:24.517
...than the environment naturally provided
for their ancestors.

36:24.683 --> 36:28.028
People all over the world
made the difficult transition...

36:28.186 --> 36:31.440
...from nomadic cultures
to agricultural ones...

36:31.606 --> 36:34.701
...that used solar energy more efficiently.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.784
It gave rise to civilization.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.917
We stand on the shoulders of those
who did the hard work...

36:42.075 --> 36:45.454

transformation required.
