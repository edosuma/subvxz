WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:28.894 --> 01:30.796
It is beautiful, isn't it, Cringer?

01:30.796 --> 01:36.234
Yup, and a beautiful place to take a nap.

01:40.339 --> 01:42.364
Whaddya say?

01:43.242 --> 01:45.077
You don't give a fella much choice.

01:45.077 --> 01:46.977
No!  Let me go!

01:48.313 --> 01:51.441
Let me go, I don't want to stay here.

01:51.650 --> 01:53.948
Why? Don't you like me?

01:54.219 --> 01:55.880
Why should she?

01:56.154 --> 01:58.624
When she should be living up here with us?

01:58.624 --> 02:00.565
Now, you just keep your distance, Willen.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.345
You and the rest of your Tree People.

02:02.594 --> 02:05.119
Don't you threaten me, Cave Dweller.

02:05.197 --> 02:07.688
I want Starchild, do you hear me?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.002
As always your words fall on deaf ears.

02:11.002 --> 02:13.301
You'll have to take her.

02:14.039 --> 02:16.437
Starchild, don't go that way.
It's not safe.

02:16.462 --> 02:17.260
Come back!

02:17.843 --> 02:19.208
No, you people you...

02:19.645 --> 02:23.342
Well you're always fighting
over something, me or...

02:23.360 --> 02:24.644
Ah!
Help me!

02:26.785 --> 02:28.013
Oh no!

02:28.253 --> 02:29.345
Starchild!

02:29.755 --> 02:31.967
She's fallen into the Old Vine Jungle.

02:31.992 --> 02:33.579
It's all your fault, Palos.

02:33.725 --> 02:35.027
My fault?

02:35.027 --> 02:36.289
Listen, if you hadn't...

02:36.829 --> 02:37.896
Get off me! Don't touch me

02:38.163 --> 02:41.132
That's an ogre!
He must have seen her fall.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.968
-Someone help me!
-What'll we do?

02:42.968 --> 02:44.697
No one is safe down there.
Save me!

02:45.404 --> 02:46.496
No one?

02:46.705 --> 02:48.536
We'll see about that.

02:50.242 --> 02:52.369
What's going on?

02:52.978 --> 02:55.469
By the power of Grayskull!

03:01.887 --> 03:05.755
I have the power!

03:18.670 --> 03:20.228
What was that?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.442
We must hurry, Battle Cat.

03:23.442 --> 03:26.275
A child has just fallen
into the Old Vine Jungle.

03:26.511 --> 03:27.739
He-Man!

03:33.952 --> 03:35.621
Keep a sharp eye, Battle Cat.

03:35.621 --> 03:38.557
There's no telling what we
might run into in this place.

03:38.557 --> 03:41.492
The vines are like snakes
and they'll grab at anything.

03:41.693 --> 03:43.320
Get away from me!

03:43.729 --> 03:45.458
No!  Don't touch me.

03:58.877 --> 04:00.811
That took a lot of my power.

04:02.414 --> 04:03.779
I better...

04:05.083 --> 04:06.618
rest now...

04:06.618 --> 04:08.347
for just a little while.

04:14.526 --> 04:16.959
There she is and just in time.

04:29.908 --> 04:31.933
Battle cat, use your muscles.

04:37.849 --> 04:38.941
Good work, Battle Cat.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.040
Huh?

04:40.452 --> 04:41.817
Ah! Don't touch me.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.045
Don't be afraid. You're safe now.

04:44.222 --> 04:46.291
Once we get you back to your parents...

04:46.291 --> 04:48.885
I... I don't have any.

04:49.094 --> 04:51.324
Well then, who takes cares of you?

04:51.496 --> 04:52.758
I guess, nobody.

04:53.865 --> 04:56.663
Uh oh. More ogres. Let's get out of here.

04:56.868 --> 04:57.926
Mount up.

04:58.070 --> 05:00.800
-On him? -He won't hurt you.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.776
Easy, easy.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.214
He-Man, you saved her!

05:15.387 --> 05:17.230
Now she can go home with me and

05:17.255 --> 05:18.676
my people, where she belongs.

05:18.857 --> 05:20.278
No, she comes with me

05:20.303 --> 05:22.078
to live with the Cave Dwellers.

05:22.327 --> 05:25.230
For now, she's going to the royal palace...

05:25.230 --> 05:28.097
where the King and Queen
will decide the issue.

05:28.633 --> 05:30.839
I will go there
and plead my case.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.956
And I also.

05:37.676 --> 05:39.379
Oh my. That is lovely,

05:39.404 --> 05:41.261
if I do say so myself.

05:44.049 --> 05:45.482
But what is it?

05:45.751 --> 05:48.379
Oh, I don't know, Teela,
but let's find out.

05:55.694 --> 05:56.854
Orko!

05:57.062 --> 05:58.461
Did you do that on purpose?

05:58.864 --> 06:00.436
Me? No way.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.576
It's just another,
goof up, I guess.

06:03.735 --> 06:04.795
Hey, look who's here.

06:07.606 --> 06:10.404
It's all right, these are my
friends, Teela and Orko.

06:11.777 --> 06:13.578
Hey, you're cute.

06:13.578 --> 06:15.910
She's more than that, she's adorable.

06:17.983 --> 06:19.814
-What are you doing? -It's...

06:20.118 --> 06:21.970
Well, it's a power I have,

06:21.995 --> 06:23.703
for those who like me.

06:24.623 --> 06:26.856
I like you, I really do.

06:26.881 --> 06:27.810
Me too.

06:28.193 --> 06:30.686
Oh my, oh that is nice.

06:30.711 --> 06:32.119
Who is she?

06:32.564 --> 06:34.088
Where did she come from?

06:34.866 --> 06:36.561
She's called Starchild...

06:36.768 --> 06:38.736
I rescued her from the Old Vine Jungle.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.084
Are you kidding?

06:40.109 --> 06:42.062
Nobody ever goes to that place.

06:42.307 --> 06:43.831
Well, this yound lady did.

06:44.109 --> 06:45.940
She was running from the Cave Dwellers...

06:46.178 --> 06:47.663
and the Tree People.

06:47.688 --> 06:50.434
They...
they were fighting over me.

06:50.916 --> 06:53.407
But why a little darling like you?

06:53.685 --> 06:55.718
Well, they both think they

06:55.743 --> 06:58.089
can use my power to beat the other...

06:58.089 --> 07:00.956
It... Well, it wasn't meant for that.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.421
What is it meant for?

07:03.528 --> 07:04.626
Not much.

07:04.651 --> 07:07.645
I mean,
it's just for liking people...

07:07.933 --> 07:10.060
and getting them to like me.

07:10.535 --> 07:13.265
That sounds more like a gift to me.

07:13.438 --> 07:16.007
Maybe, but it's still a power.

07:16.007 --> 07:17.594
In that case, I think the King and

07:17.619 --> 07:19.296
Queen should meet our little friend.

07:22.948 --> 07:24.567
Looking at her, almost makes

07:24.592 --> 07:26.499
me wish Adam was still a child.

07:26.585 --> 07:28.610
Adam will always be my child.

07:29.020 --> 07:31.250
But what will we do with this child?

07:31.456 --> 07:32.980
Give her to me!

07:33.291 --> 07:34.189
Palos!

07:34.392 --> 07:37.623
Yes.
Of the Cave Dwellers, Your Majesties.

07:37.863 --> 07:40.127
And I see you've found my ward.

07:40.365 --> 07:41.684
By the Eternia's heart,

07:41.709 --> 07:43.085
I was so very worried.

07:43.335 --> 07:44.802
I'll bet you were.

07:45.003 --> 07:47.005
Well, after all, I am her guardian...

07:47.005 --> 07:49.473
and I'm glad my little ward is safe.

07:49.674 --> 07:50.850
Then we'll keep her here,

07:50.875 --> 07:52.098
where she's even safer.

07:52.344 --> 07:54.270
Oh? Well, I'm afraid that

07:54.295 --> 07:56.429
my eternal enemies,
the Tree People might try to...

07:56.648 --> 07:59.116
capture her.
I'd much prefer to keep her with me.

07:59.651 --> 08:00.777
No!

08:05.957 --> 08:08.289
Hurry! She can't go far.

08:10.595 --> 08:11.584
Starchild, wait!

08:13.999 --> 08:15.990
I thought I heard someone here.

08:23.341 --> 08:24.643
Have you found anything?

08:24.643 --> 08:27.271
I thought I had, but it was you.

08:36.288 --> 08:38.289
You may as well come on back, little one.
There's

08:38.289 --> 08:40.952
no place to hide.

08:42.794 --> 08:44.663
Either the sun went down awfully fast,

08:44.663 --> 08:46.498
or someone's turned the lights off.

08:46.498 --> 08:49.023
A flashball should light things up.

08:54.606 --> 08:55.794
Ah! That's better.

08:55.819 --> 08:58.259
Now I better go check these lights.

09:07.686 --> 09:10.348
This must be Teela's room.

09:12.991 --> 09:16.328
So, Teela appreciates beautiful crystals?

09:16.328 --> 09:19.263
This information may come in very handy.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.931
The power source has stopped.

09:24.956 --> 09:26.091
Very strange.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.345
Starchild, wait!

09:37.282 --> 09:40.115
He-Man, she went down that hallway.

09:40.418 --> 09:41.817
Let's go.

09:48.727 --> 09:51.287
Now be careful, we don't want to scare her.

09:55.633 --> 09:56.657
Scare her?

09:56.682 --> 09:58.017
How about us?

09:58.403 --> 09:59.665
Stand back!

10:05.643 --> 10:06.488
Are you hurt?

10:06.513 --> 10:08.397
No, just a little shocked.

10:21.192 --> 10:24.025
-We'll have to jump for it.
-Oh no! Look!

10:27.432 --> 10:30.135
There's only one direction left to go.

10:30.135 --> 10:31.432
Down!

10:36.741 --> 10:38.243
I'll fix the floor later.

10:38.243 --> 10:39.938
Let's get back to the throne room.

10:43.214 --> 10:44.699
You two are just in time to

10:44.724 --> 10:46.264
hear this Treeman's story.

10:46.451 --> 10:47.668
Have you found the child?

10:47.693 --> 10:49.103
No, Your Majesty, not yet.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.482
I figured you'd show up sooner or later.

10:51.689 --> 10:54.249
I only came to thank you
for looking for my ward.

10:54.492 --> 10:55.789
-Yours? -Yes.

10:56.227 --> 10:58.752
During some fighting with the
evil Cave Dwellers...

10:58.863 --> 11:01.002
The Starchild was accidentally lost.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.100
That's not true.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.728
We are not evil. You are.

11:05.970 --> 11:08.131
Please, no fighting in the throne room.

11:08.306 --> 11:09.637
No fighting at all.

11:09.841 --> 11:11.943
The child will remain
under royal protection...

11:11.943 --> 11:14.112
until we settle this
issue once and for all.

11:14.112 --> 11:16.046
Now, everyone, keep searching.

11:16.147 --> 11:17.205
You heard the King.

11:18.016 --> 11:19.068
Yes, Your Majesty.

11:19.093 --> 11:20.574
Of course, Your Majesty.

11:28.593 --> 11:30.993
Starchild?
Can you hear me?

11:32.263 --> 11:34.390
I didn't mean to startle you.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.091
Oh, thank you.  It's beautiful.

11:37.335 --> 11:40.031
Oh, not half as beautiful as you.

11:41.272 --> 11:43.832
I hope that Starchild
would grow to be as lovely.

11:44.109 --> 11:46.236
What a nice compliment. Thank you.

11:46.478 --> 11:48.980
Help me, use your skills as a soldier...

11:48.980 --> 11:51.244
to help me find her before Willen does.

11:51.549 --> 11:53.847
I couldn't do that. It wouldn't be right.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.882
This is what forms the walls of my caves.

11:57.088 --> 12:00.225
Teela, I can give her beauty
such as you've only dreamed.

12:00.225 --> 12:02.887
You must help me.
You do seem sincere.

12:04.028 --> 12:06.326
Oh, very well. Come with me.

12:10.869 --> 12:11.858
Starchild?

12:12.303 --> 12:14.601
Starchild.
Can you hear me?

12:15.640 --> 12:18.131
She was last seen around here.

12:18.543 --> 12:19.373
There she is.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.414
Palos, do something.

12:24.649 --> 12:25.980
I can't!

12:26.451 --> 12:27.679
We're rising!

12:28.520 --> 12:29.316
Oh no!

12:29.821 --> 12:31.652
We're heading for the skylight.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.458
-Teela? - Oh He-Man, thank goodness.

12:37.862 --> 12:39.227
Get us out of here!

12:49.440 --> 12:50.429
Hurry!

13:02.754 --> 13:05.222
Now that you're down, let's get you out.

13:05.323 --> 13:06.483
Stand aside!

13:10.662 --> 13:11.895
Oh thanks,

13:11.920 --> 13:14.417
you know that was Starchild's doing.

13:14.632 --> 13:17.168
Yes, she has more power than we know.

13:17.168 --> 13:20.365
We'd better find her and fast.
-C'mon.

13:27.745 --> 13:30.407
Now where's my Sonic Wrench?

13:31.482 --> 13:33.211
-Thanks. -You're welcome.

13:33.518 --> 13:35.587
I thought you were my daughter.

13:35.587 --> 13:36.884
Well, not quite.

13:36.909 --> 13:38.478
I was looking for Starchild.

13:38.756 --> 13:40.747
Well, she's not here. I assure you.

13:40.992 --> 13:43.483
That's a clever device you're working on.
A sensor?

13:43.761 --> 13:45.126
But, yes it is.

13:45.396 --> 13:48.297
Hopefully,
it will help locate the little girl.

13:48.433 --> 13:51.334
If I can just work out this one problem.

13:51.469 --> 13:52.902
Uh, may I?

13:55.873 --> 13:57.407
I think that did it.

13:57.432 --> 13:59.196
You are very skilled.

13:59.444 --> 14:01.312
You should use such knowledge for things...

14:01.312 --> 14:03.163
other than fighting
the Cave Dwellers.

14:03.188 --> 14:05.196
Well, that is my dream.

14:05.416 --> 14:08.408
Why, I must find Starchild.

14:09.754 --> 14:11.051
Wait.

14:13.758 --> 14:16.852
Perhaps we can work together
for everyone's sake.

14:18.997 --> 14:20.931
It's picking up something?

14:23.435 --> 14:24.436
Hey.

14:24.536 --> 14:25.974
That's the laser defense system.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.379
It's not supposed to do that.

14:35.546 --> 14:37.571
We're trapped.  Help!

14:38.016 --> 14:39.313
That's Man-At-Arms.

14:39.584 --> 14:41.415
Wait here, there may be danger.

14:44.324 --> 14:45.757
Get us out of here, please!

14:49.327 --> 14:51.090
This should do it.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.469
Thanks,
you got here just in the nick of time.

15:01.739 --> 15:02.967
I'm glad I could help.

15:05.310 --> 15:06.504
Let's check over there.

15:10.748 --> 15:13.151
Now let's see.
If I were a little girl...

15:13.151 --> 15:14.152
frightened...

15:14.152 --> 15:16.620
lonely... what would I do?

15:26.030 --> 15:28.089
Nobody wants me.

15:29.367 --> 15:32.370
I think that maybe too
many people want you.

15:32.370 --> 15:35.737
It isn't me. It's my power.

15:36.174 --> 15:37.869
Tell me about it.

15:38.109 --> 15:39.393
I told you.

15:39.418 --> 15:43.036
It's very, very strong power.

15:43.281 --> 15:44.454
So, I've seen.

15:44.479 --> 15:46.741
You haven't seen it all.

15:46.951 --> 15:51.047
I... I can also use it to protect myself.

15:51.556 --> 15:53.183
Yes, you certainly can.

15:53.491 --> 15:57.518
The last thing I ever
wanted to do is hurt someone...

15:57.729 --> 16:02.530
but [sniff] grown-ups like Willen
and Palos, they think that...

16:03.167 --> 16:05.570
They think if they can have your power...

16:05.570 --> 16:08.039
it would help one conquer the other, right?

16:08.039 --> 16:10.007
Something like that.

16:12.076 --> 16:13.873
Everyone is being summoned.

16:14.078 --> 16:16.647
I think now is a good time for you and I...

16:16.647 --> 16:19.411
to have a good long talk
with the King and Queen.

16:21.419 --> 16:23.588
You think they'll understand?

16:23.588 --> 16:25.988
Well, that's up to us. Okay?

16:30.395 --> 16:33.398
It has become quite obvious the
Starchild will not be found...

16:33.398 --> 16:34.699
until she is ready.

16:34.699 --> 16:37.463
We must know what it is
that has her so frightened.

16:37.702 --> 16:40.371
She has certain energies, my Queen...

16:40.371 --> 16:42.538
if she does not learn to control them, she

16:42.563 --> 16:44.729
could accidentally destroy us all

16:44.876 --> 16:48.778
-Now, I and my people will teach her to...
-No!

16:49.046 --> 16:51.007
I, Palos, and my people,

16:51.032 --> 16:52.784
we must be allowed to teach her to...

16:52.784 --> 16:55.582
You see? You hear what they're saying?

16:55.853 --> 16:58.822
I don't need teaching.
They, do.

16:59.157 --> 17:02.251
If they had my power,
they'd destroy each other.

17:02.593 --> 17:05.221
See?
I told you it wouldn't work.

17:05.496 --> 17:07.828
I'm better off alone.

17:08.132 --> 17:09.326
No, Starchild, wait!

17:09.634 --> 17:11.688
She is not afraid for herself.

17:11.713 --> 17:13.355
She is afraid for you.

17:13.438 --> 17:14.505
Teela, come on.

17:18.976 --> 17:20.065
Starchild!

17:20.778 --> 17:21.845
Starchild!

17:27.617 --> 17:28.642
Starchild!

17:30.054 --> 17:31.522
We'll have to go after her.

17:31.522 --> 17:33.387
That's the tunnel to the Old Vine Jungle.

17:33.558 --> 17:35.025
All the more reason.

17:35.726 --> 17:37.489
-I'm going with you. -Me too.

17:37.795 --> 17:38.558
Good for you.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.344
Well, the more the merrier.

17:48.739 --> 17:51.342
Be careful.
There's danger all around us.

17:51.342 --> 17:53.003
Hey!  Let go!

17:55.446 --> 17:56.378
Teela!

17:57.248 --> 17:59.217
Wait! That's a tickle trap.

17:59.217 --> 18:00.918
If you attack, it squirts a liquid...

18:00.918 --> 18:03.614
that could be very dangerous to humans.

18:04.021 --> 18:06.012
But if you tickle it...

18:06.657 --> 18:08.124
it lets go!

18:10.194 --> 18:14.028
Phew,
I like a plant with a sense of humor.

18:20.304 --> 18:21.464
Starchild!

18:22.373 --> 18:23.767
Wait a minute.
Don't make a sound.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.264
These are filled with echo crystals.

18:25.910 --> 18:28.242
Loud noises make 'em explode.

18:30.715 --> 18:33.240
Go away.
I don't want to hurt you.

18:33.651 --> 18:35.744
Please leave me alone.

18:46.631 --> 18:49.259
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

18:51.536 --> 18:53.128
We've got him, Starchild!

19:00.745 --> 19:02.713
This'll finish him, Starchild!

19:05.116 --> 19:07.107
He-Man, throw him in there!

19:11.389 --> 19:13.949
I'm glad you spotted that
tangle-tree, Willen.

19:14.158 --> 19:17.025
That should keep him
tied up for quite a while.

19:19.530 --> 19:21.858
You risked getting hurt to help me?

19:21.883 --> 19:23.670
You, both thought of me,

19:23.695 --> 19:24.881
and not of yourselves?

19:27.772 --> 19:32.209
So all this time, you've each
sought the Starchild's power...

19:32.209 --> 19:35.012
to overcome the other. Pah.

19:35.012 --> 19:38.449
Yes, Your Majesty, but only so that
we, the Tree People...

19:38.449 --> 19:41.748
could make the Cave Dwellers understand
that we should live in peace.

19:41.953 --> 19:45.013
But that's all we,
the Cave Dwellers ever wanted.

19:45.122 --> 19:46.521
To live in harmony.

19:46.757 --> 19:47.522
So you see,

19:47.547 --> 19:49.841
it was all a simple misunderstanding.

19:50.094 --> 19:51.703
I guess the power,

19:51.728 --> 19:54.231
to love and protect one another...

19:54.231 --> 19:56.495
is sometimes hard to come by.

19:56.901 --> 19:58.924
Then go, take the Starchild,

19:58.949 --> 20:01.259
and give her the best of both.

20:01.472 --> 20:03.269
The caves and the trees.

20:03.574 --> 20:06.566
The entire Crystal Forest
and all its beauty.

20:06.644 --> 20:07.678
That is...

20:07.678 --> 20:09.339
if that is your wish.

20:17.321 --> 20:19.721
It is... so decreed.

20:22.193 --> 20:24.388
Well, looks like the war's over.

20:25.296 --> 20:26.763
Thank goodness.

20:30.568 --> 20:33.264
Today we saw people
fighting over the Starchild.

20:33.571 --> 20:36.768
But in the end,
her power brought these people together.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.576
It might surprise you to know...

20:38.576 --> 20:40.771
that all of us have a
power like the Starchild's.

20:40.978 --> 20:44.048
You can't see it or touch
it, but you can feel it.

20:44.048 --> 20:45.515
It's called 'love'.

20:45.716 --> 20:47.652
When you care deeply about others,

20:47.652 --> 20:49.283
and you're kind and gentle,

20:49.308 --> 20:51.155
then you're using that power.

20:51.155 --> 20:53.724
And that's very special magic indeed.

20:53.724 --> 20:56.022
Until later, goodbye for now.
