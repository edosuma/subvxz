My name is Earl.

00:03.837 --> 00:07.375
[ Earl Narrating ] Ever since
I started doin' the list,
it'd just been me and Randy.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.443
But, now my new wife, Billie,
made three.

00:09.510 --> 00:13.747
Mmm! Watch this.
There's this part comin' up
that's really funny.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.317
And I was startin'
to understand the expression,
"Three's a crowd."

00:16.384 --> 00:19.053
See, he's gonna think that
it's his wife licking his leg.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.922
But it's really gonna be
the dog. Watch. Watch.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.558
[ Cackles ]

00:24.625 --> 00:28.096
Yup, there it is,
just like you said.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.864
Thanks for tellin' me
so I could be ready for it.

00:30.931 --> 00:34.735
[ Earl Narrating ]
And the way we watched TV
wasn't the only change.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.805
I used to drive my own car,
but Billie thought
I drove like a girl,

00:37.871 --> 00:40.508
so she insisted
on doin' it herself.
[ Tires Screech ]

00:41.942 --> 00:45.346
You better take five steps
backwards right now, bitch!

00:45.413 --> 00:47.781
Unfortunately,
she had a problem
with road rage.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.518
Just forget it!
It's gone! Go!

00:54.488 --> 00:58.826
And I used to have my own money,
but I spent it throwin'
an arsonist a prison prom.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.163
And while it was an enchanted
evening, it left me broke,

01:02.230 --> 01:04.098
and I was now livin' off Billie.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.235
-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
How many tissues you got there?
-Two.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.404
- How many times you gonna
blow your nose?
- One.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.806
You might wanna check
your math, Mr. Rockefeller.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.010
[ Earl Narrating ]
And because Billie's money
also paid for the room,

01:17.077 --> 01:19.813
she got to decide
the sleepin' arrangements.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.117
Of course he can stay with us,
Earl. He's family.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.686
He's just gonna have to
be an outside brother.

[ Groans ]

01:37.265 --> 01:41.068
[ Earl Narrating ]
My favorite part of the day
was when Billie took a shower--

01:41.135 --> 01:44.638
until she started singing.
[ Billie, Off-key ]
* Almost heaven *

01:44.705 --> 01:47.107
I don't get it, Randy.
I just don't get it.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.578
Why would karma want me
to be with a woman
who's driving me crazy?

01:50.644 --> 01:53.481
You should just
cut her head off like that
king of England dude...

01:53.547 --> 01:55.549
or the guy who
used to live downstairs.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.686
It's not that easy.
Billie's supposed to
be my reward.

01:58.752 --> 02:02.022
Karma brought her into my life
to show me that
I was doin' things right.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.625
You don't return
a gift like that.

02:04.692 --> 02:08.462
You do if she makes you
sleep outside. I got sprayed
by a cat last night.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.098
Which is a lie--
It wasn't a cat.
It was a grown man.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.000
I was too embarrassed
to say that.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.170
I know Billie's a handful,
but I'm sure karma
has its reasons.

02:16.237 --> 02:19.507
Not to mention, before Billie
hit me with her car,
her life was a mess.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.642
I can't let her
go back to that.

02:21.709 --> 02:25.946
[ Billie, Off-Key ]
* Country road

02:26.013 --> 02:31.485
* To a place

02:31.552 --> 02:33.921
I'm gonna go sleep
on the balcony.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.991
I kinda made friends with
that Filipino grandmother
from Room 206.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.893
They won't let her
sleep inside either.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.895
[ Earl Narrating ]
I couldn't help
but think about...

02:41.962 --> 02:44.131
how different my reality was
compared to my fantasy.

02:44.198 --> 02:48.269
When I was in a coma,
my relationship with Billie
was perfect.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.439
She made me cakes.
She brought me lemonade.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.342
And when she kissed me,
even her leg got excited.

02:54.408 --> 02:58.246
I wondered why karma
brought me out of my coma
only to make me more miserable.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.215
And I wondered
was it just gonna get worse
for the rest of my life?

03:01.282 --> 03:04.718
There's nothin' like a crap
and a shower to make you
feel better.

[ Voice Breaking ]
I think I'm just gonna
go for a walk.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.331
[ Earl Narrating ]
I married Billie
'cause I trusted karma.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.500
Karma had never
let me down before,

03:19.567 --> 03:22.736
but every day that went by
made me lose
a little more faith.

03:24.071 --> 03:27.040
I did 25 minutes
at level six.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.009
If you can't beat me,
you're a wuss.

You wanna grow old together,
we need to be healthy.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.286
[ Earl Narrating ]
Yup, this marriage
was definitely a mystery.

03:38.352 --> 03:43.190
I needed some advice,
so I went to see
the smartest person I knew.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.993
There was a reason Joy
and Darnell's trailer
was on its side.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.263
A while back,
me and some friends
broke in to have a party.

03:49.330 --> 03:53.534
Normally when you have beer
and strippers in a trailer,
you tip the strippers.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.803
We went another way
and tipped the trailer.

I really am sorry about
this whole trailer thing.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.360
Ah, don't sweat it, Earl.
I kinda like it.

04:19.427 --> 04:24.365
Besides, with the grass growin'
out of the floor, Mr. Turtle
has his own little park.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.670
Huh.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.105
Never seen him
wag his little tail before.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.274
Yeah, I'm happy for him.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.078
Listen, I need to ask you
a marriage question.

04:38.145 --> 04:41.014
How do you handle
being married to someone
who's difficult?

04:41.081 --> 04:43.016
Try this.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.621
I just write down
everything Joy does
that bothers me.

04:47.688 --> 04:52.626
Most psychologists will tell you
to express your feelings
without fear of confrontation.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.763
These are individuals I call
"people who have not met Joy."

04:55.829 --> 04:58.899
Earl, you gotta
flip this trailer right side up.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.301
I got so many bruises
from climbin' through this door,

I look like a woman
in a Lifetime movie.

I'm gonna do it. I just need to
figure out how to get some money
from Billie to rent a crane.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.478
One way would be
to grow some nads.

Our goal was--

22:37.790 --> 22:40.627
Well, I think our goal
was pretty obvious.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.095
This barley soda
is making me feel
warm under the bonnet.

22:45.097 --> 22:48.801
You know, that dancing thing
looks interesting,
but I'm afraid to try it alone.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.070
Oh, do not be afraid,
Earleth.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.039
I shall do it with you.

22:53.105 --> 22:57.544
Okay. But we gotta stay
real close, so the devil
doesn't get between us.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.351
If there's anything
you're afraid of, I'd be
willing to try it with you.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.454
Unless it's cauliflower.

I had a good thing goin'.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.627
And I did it year after year.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.363
Some years,
the crops were plentiful.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.132
Other years,
there was a drought.

23:20.199 --> 23:23.369
But a good farmer always
finds something to plow.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.612
[ Earl Narrating ] So I went
back to Camdenite Village and
talked to their leader, Ruth,

23:32.679 --> 23:35.448
to see how I could make up
to all those former virgins.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.818
None of 'em are here.
They never came back.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.721
They were alive
when we left 'em, if that's
what you're hinting at.

23:41.788 --> 23:47.460
No. They all had such a great
time in the outside world,
they decided to stay.

23:47.527 --> 23:51.898
Wow, if they're happy now,
I guess it's not the worst thing
I ever did to women.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.635
Maybe not to them,
but it was to the rest of us.

You started a trend.

And you know how kids are--
always swept up
in the latest craze,

24:01.440 --> 24:05.778
like zippers or those
wooden figures on a stick
that dance on your knee.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.148
None of our daughters
come back anymore.

24:09.215 --> 24:13.019
And without women,
the Camdenites
will soon be gone.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.188
Maybe karma wants me to make
somethin' up to you.

24:16.255 --> 24:20.660
I know. We can buy you
a pitchfork so you could shovel
horse food like a normal person.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.796
We don't use pitchforks.
They are the tool of the devil.

24:26.332 --> 24:31.037
Although, I tried one once,
and it was about
a thousand times easier.

somethin' I can do.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.577

will go out into the world.

make sure she comes back.

that if Greta returned...

24:54.393 --> 24:56.195
after bein'
in the outside world,

24:56.262 --> 24:58.464
other Camdenite girls would
follow her example...

24:58.531 --> 25:00.533
and their community
would be saved.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.536
To convince Greta that
she wouldn't wanna live
in the outside world,

25:03.603 --> 25:07.273
I showed her the scariest
