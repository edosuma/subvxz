<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:57.584 --> 02:00.417
<i>911, what's your emergency?
Are you there?</i>

02:03.723 --> 02:05.020
<i> There...</i>
<i>There are people here.</i>

02:05.158 --> 02:08.650
<i>Okay, calm down. Where are you?
What's your address?</i>

02:08.761 --> 02:09.728
<i>I don't know.</i>

02:09.829 --> 02:10.818
<i>Are you in danger?</i>

02:10.930 --> 02:12.693
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:13.766
<i>What's your name?</i>

02:13.867 --> 02:15.061
<i>Jordan.</i>

02:16.569 --> 02:18.093
<i>We need help.</i>

02:18.204 --> 02:20.604
<i>Okay. Can you tell me</i>
<i>what street you're on?</i>

02:20.707 --> 02:22.675
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>where we are.</i>

02:22.775 --> 02:24.675
<i>Jordan, who</i>
<i>are you with?</i>

02:24.777 --> 02:27.803
<i>We went into the house.</i>
<i>We found people.</i>

02:29.482 --> 02:31.780
<i>You found who, Jordan?</i>
<i>Who did you find?</i>

02:32.285 --> 02:34.116
<i>There's blood</i>
<i>on the walls.</i>

02:34.220 --> 02:35.812
<i>Help us! Help us!</i>

02:35.922 --> 02:37.184
<i>Jordan. Jordan, calm down.</i>

02:38.057 --> 02:39.149
<i>It's everywhere.</i>

02:39.259 --> 02:40.920
<i>Jordan, what happened?</i>

02:41.094 --> 02:42.959
<i>There's blood</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

05:23.256 --> 05:25.121
When did you do all this?

05:25.858 --> 05:28.850
Today. With Mike.

05:29.662 --> 05:34.326
When you were with the girls.
I thought you'd like it.

05:53.586 --> 05:56.146
You can have this room.
I'm gonna get set up out there.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.820
Yeah, I don't know
about the tub.

06:06.566 --> 06:10.024
Didn't know if the roses
go in first or after.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.029
Yeah, I don't
know either.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.847
Here.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.179
Let me.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.415
Thank you.
Okay.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.740
Mike, it's me.
We're at the house now.

06:51.077 --> 06:56.447
I... I know you're fucking drunk,
maybe you're asleep now, but...

06:57.617 --> 06:58.845
Uh...

06:58.951 --> 07:01.010
I'll tell you when
I see you, but things...

07:01.788 --> 07:05.053
They didn't work out
the way I planned at all.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.247
Um...

07:06.359 --> 07:08.054
I'm going to need you to
come out here and get me.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.030
Just whenever you wake up in the morning.
I'm going to give her the car.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.793
Just call me when
you get this, okay?

07:14.901 --> 07:17.734
I know it's a bitch to
come all the way out here

07:17.837 --> 07:21.705
but, sorry,
this sucks. Okay.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.699
Hi.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.798
Hi.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.629
Come outside
with me.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.868
I only wanted
to dance with you.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.132
We're dancing
right now.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.229
Jerk.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.172
You're a jerk.
You're a jerk.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.179
Oh, it's freezing.
Let's get in the car.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.149
Wait a second.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.986
What?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.986
I just want to
tell you something.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.058
What do you
wanna tell me?

08:58.137 --> 09:01.504
I remember the first
time I ever saw you.

10:13.312 --> 10:16.713
It's really nice,
everything you did.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.283
It's beautiful.

10:20.486 --> 10:21.646
Yeah.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.723
Here.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.791
I can't keep it.
I can't take it back.

10:33.766 --> 10:34.926
Please.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.906
Just take it, please.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.288
Here.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.600
Your clothes are in the
bedroom, if you want.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.311
I wanna wear this.

11:21.047 --> 11:25.814
You know, I only get to wear it tonight.
It makes me feel pretty.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.015
You are pretty.

11:35.294 --> 11:38.229
I'm so sorry it wasn't the
way you thought it would be.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.399
I'm really sorry.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.929
Well, what do we do now?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.197
I don't know.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.202
I'm just not
ready yet.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.107
Okay.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.058
James, please...
Please.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.255
Talk to me.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.388
Christ.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.367
This is embarrassing.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.132
You are my girl.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.467
What is it, like,
4:00 in the morning?

14:31.170 --> 14:32.660
Hi.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.033
Hello.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.940
Is Tamara here?

14:46.652 --> 14:49.018
No. No, you got
the wrong house.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.454
You sure?

14:52.758 --> 14:55.192
Yeah. I'm sorry.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.567
See you later.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.375
That was weird.

15:12.478 --> 15:13.740
Yeah.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.247
You know, people get lost out here.
Should I go get her?

15:17.349 --> 15:20.580
She seemed okay. I mean,
I think she would've said if she wasn't.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.652
It's cold out there.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.616
I'm out of cigarettes.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.157
I'll go get
you some more.

16:04.663 --> 16:08.326
I didn't mean that.
You don't have to.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.060
I'll just go to sleep.
I'm tired, anyway.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.996
No, you won't.

16:15.841 --> 16:18.071
I'll try.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.338
It's all right, I want to
drive for a while, anyway.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.348
Let me light
you a fire.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.794
I was thinking when
you were taking a bath.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.767
I want you to take
the car back tomorrow.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.364
What do you mean?

16:48.474 --> 16:50.840
I don't think a road trip's
a good idea right now.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.405
I called Mike. He's gonna come
out and get me in the morning.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.512
Are you sure
that's what you want?

17:07.159 --> 17:08.683
Yeah.

17:12.397 --> 17:13.729
Okay, I'll be back.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.862
If you want, we
can talk some more.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.564
We don't have
to. Okay?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.669
You gonna be
okay here?

17:24.777 --> 17:25.766
Yeah, I'll be fine.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.071
Okay.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.544
Thanks for lighting
me a fire.

17:28.647 --> 17:29.705
Sure.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.063
Hello?

20:40.005 --> 20:41.836
Is Tamara home?

20:46.311 --> 20:48.677
You already
came by here.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.146
Are you sure?

23:10.021 --> 23:11.420
Oh, come on.

23:43.822 --> 23:46.655
James, where are you?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.350
That girl came back.

23:49.461 --> 23:52.726
That girl, I mean, she
keeps knocking on the door.

23:55.367 --> 23:58.131
What do you mean?
I heard her voice.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.897
No, I didn't
open the door.

24:02.507 --> 24:03.838
I don't know.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.410
The battery is dead.
I'm charging it right now.

24:07.646 --> 24:08.874
Okay, okay.

24:10.348 --> 24:12.213
I just want you
to come home, okay?

24:15.187 --> 24:17.951
No, I'm fine, but just,
you know, hurry.

24:19.324 --> 24:22.122
How far away are you?

24:22.227 --> 24:23.387
Okay.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.758
Will you just stay
on the phone with me?

24:30.502 --> 24:31.764
James?

25:59.291 --> 26:00.451
James?

27:45.030 --> 27:48.090
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.646
Go away!

30:35.900 --> 30:37.458
Jamie.
Kristen.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.364
There is someone out there.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.166
What are you doing? What?
There's something...

30:42.273 --> 30:43.900
They'll hear you.
Stop, stop, stop.

30:44.008 --> 30:44.975
Shh!

30:45.109 --> 30:47.304
What happened
to your hand?

30:50.081 --> 30:51.480
Stop. Stop!

30:51.583 --> 30:55.349
Come here, come here. Sit down.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

30:55.453 --> 30:56.477
How do you know there's
somebody out there?

30:56.588 --> 30:59.751
I saw a man at the back door.
He's wearing a mask.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.985
What do you mean?
Like a ski mask? What?

31:02.093 --> 31:03.321
I don't know.
A fucking mask!

31:03.428 --> 31:05.760
I don't know.
Okay, okay. Calm down.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.331
Jamie, I'm so scared.

31:07.432 --> 31:08.524
Okay.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.068
Don't go out there.
Please, don't go.

31:16.174 --> 31:17.869
Please, stop.
Just stay here.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.534
I'm right here. Stop.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.892
No one out here.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.655
Nobody. Come here.

31:38.863 --> 31:39.852
Come here.

32:45.863 --> 32:47.524
It's okay, there's nothing here.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.436
So, what do
you wanna do?

32:58.476 --> 32:59.773
I don't know.

33:01.846 --> 33:03.006
Kristen?

33:08.619 --> 33:10.018
Kristen,
what is it?

33:13.624 --> 33:15.182
She's watching us.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.326
She looks like a ghost.

33:20.631 --> 33:22.030
You want me
to go talk to her?

33:22.133 --> 33:23.157
They don't wanna talk.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.461
Well, they want something.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.867
People just don't stand out
there staring at us like that.

33:26.971 --> 33:28.302
They want something.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.536
Shit.
What?

33:32.643 --> 33:34.201
I left my phone in the car,
I'm gonna go get it.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.610
You can't go out there.

33:36.714 --> 33:37.738
Why?

33:37.849 --> 33:40.875
One of them came in
here and took my phone.

33:40.985 --> 33:42.646
Kristen, nobody
came in here.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.256
She's gone.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.473
Fuck!

35:04.135 --> 35:05.397
Shit!

35:41.739 --> 35:43.707
What do you want?

35:45.443 --> 35:47.308
All right, get the
fuck out of here!

35:51.549 --> 35:52.811
James!

35:53.818 --> 35:55.149
Kristen, go back inside.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.618
What's happening?
Kristen...

36:01.025 --> 36:02.617
Kristen, go.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.442
Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.279
I'm sorry. I'm waiting for you.

37:34.385 --> 37:36.285
I want you to get your things.
Put your shoes on.

37:36.387 --> 37:37.354
Did you find your phone?

37:37.455 --> 37:38.513
No, I told you,
they took my phone.

37:38.623 --> 37:39.612
Babe, I put it
in your bag.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.055
James, it's not
in the bag.

37:41.158 --> 37:43.626
I plugged it into the wall,
and when I came back it was gone.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.491
It's just, I don't understand.
We checked the whole house,

37:45.596 --> 37:47.325
and nobody in here.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.695
Let me see your hand.

37:58.175 --> 37:59.403
What are you
thinking?

38:00.444 --> 38:03.845
Since we've been here I
haven't heard a dog bark,

38:05.082 --> 38:07.516
a car pass, nothing.

38:09.987 --> 38:11.454
Just us and them.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.353
Why are they
doing this?

38:15.459 --> 38:18.019
Kristen, I don't want you
to think about that, okay?

38:18.129 --> 38:22.031
Don't think about it.
Doesn't matter right now.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.201
We don't need a reason if
they come through that door.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.772
Okay?

38:48.626 --> 38:49.923
What is it?

38:50.061 --> 38:52.291
It's my phone.

38:53.564 --> 38:54.929
We gotta get
out of here.

39:17.254 --> 39:18.312
Shit.

39:18.522 --> 39:19.682
Who is that?

39:20.057 --> 39:21.081
I don't know.

39:30.901 --> 39:32.163
Get out
of the car.

39:45.483 --> 39:46.711
Come on.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.704
James, we
need a gun.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.367
I'm looking.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.004
Does your dad
have a gun?

40:11.108 --> 40:12.769
Kristen,
I'm looking.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.807
There was one here when I was a kid.
He always hid it.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.094
Let's go to
the bedroom.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.197
Oh, my God!

41:05.429 --> 41:06.691
What are you doing?

41:06.797 --> 41:07.957
Looking for bullets.

41:13.270 --> 41:15.033
Stop. I got them,
I got them.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.710
I don't know how
to use this thing.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.082
What do you mean?

41:31.188 --> 41:32.450
I'm not sure I even
know how to load it.

41:33.390 --> 41:35.255
But you said you used
to hunt with your dad.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.287
No, I never did.
It was just something that I said.

41:55.613 --> 41:58.480
When I open the door,
I just want you to run, okay?

42:03.587 --> 42:05.578
Block the door,
block the door.

42:16.433 --> 42:17.559
Push!

42:38.589 --> 42:39.988
Come on.

43:08.719 --> 43:10.846
We're not gonna
fucking die here.

43:10.955 --> 43:14.152
We're gonna sit here, we're gonna wait
for the fucking cops to come, or whatever,

43:14.258 --> 43:15.282
but we're not
gonna fucking die.

44:20.724 --> 44:25.388
Yo, Jimmy James.
What's up, buddy?

44:25.829 --> 44:29.458
It's Mike. Listen, man, I'm outside.
I got here early.

44:29.733 --> 44:32.600
I just decided to come out,
and you know,

44:32.703 --> 44:35.137
just be here for you as
soon as I possibly could,

44:35.272 --> 44:38.173
because you know how I like to
wait on you hand and fucking foot.

44:43.313 --> 44:44.371
What the fuck?

45:25.889 --> 45:27.186
Hello?

45:32.763 --> 45:33.957
Jimmy?

45:36.166 --> 45:37.133
Kristen?

47:50.400 --> 47:51.799
Hello?

48:08.285 --> 48:09.946
Kristen, I shot him.

48:14.258 --> 48:15.623
He didn't have a mask.

48:15.726 --> 48:16.818
What?

48:16.927 --> 48:18.326
Why didn't he have
a fucking mask?

48:18.428 --> 48:20.055
What do you mean,
he didn't have a mask?

48:21.698 --> 48:23.529
James?

48:25.469 --> 48:26.629
James?

48:44.187 --> 48:45.313
What?

48:45.422 --> 48:46.446
Oh, God!

48:46.556 --> 48:48.421
What is it?
Stay there.

48:48.792 --> 48:50.123
James, answer me.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.659
Oh, fuck!

48:51.795 --> 48:53.285
What?

48:53.397 --> 48:55.331
Don't. Stay there.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.662
Get off of me.
Stop it.

48:57.801 --> 48:59.268
It's Mike. Mike.

48:59.369 --> 49:00.700
Please don't look.
It's Mike.

49:00.804 --> 49:02.396
Oh, God.

49:19.589 --> 49:21.489
Baby, it's
not your fault.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.902
He was my best friend.
He's my best friend.

49:33.003 --> 49:35.870
He was my best friend.
What am I gonna do?

50:13.143 --> 50:14.405
Where are you going?

50:28.258 --> 50:31.591
I'm gonna go outside.
I want you to hide somewhere.

50:31.695 --> 50:32.855
What are you
talking about?

50:32.963 --> 50:35.955
There's an old radio at the barn,
I'm gonna try and call for help.

50:36.066 --> 50:37.533
I don't know
what else to do.

50:39.302 --> 50:42.100
It's okay, I'm gonna
come right back for you.

50:45.308 --> 50:47.674
Listen, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide there.

50:47.778 --> 50:49.405
I'll keep them away.
I'll come find you.

50:49.513 --> 50:50.537
James, no. I want
to come with you.

50:50.647 --> 50:53.172
Kristen, please, it'll
be okay, I promise.

50:54.451 --> 50:56.248
I'll be fine.

51:05.295 --> 51:07.525
Be careful. James.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.466
Oh, shit!

52:45.996 --> 52:47.725
James?

54:10.030 --> 54:11.054
Ah!

54:35.555 --> 54:37.147
Oh, fuck!

55:46.893 --> 55:48.258
James?

57:05.939 --> 57:07.463
Hello?

57:07.574 --> 57:08.768
Hello?

57:28.428 --> 57:29.395
Hello?

57:40.273 --> 57:42.104
Can anybody hear me?

58:49.442 --> 58:51.171
<i>This is K-50.</i>

58:53.546 --> 58:54.513
<i>Hello?</i>

58:54.614 --> 58:56.878
Can you hear me?
Hello?

58:58.919 --> 59:00.853
Please,
answer me.

59:04.624 --> 59:06.023
Help me.

59:06.126 --> 59:07.286
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:56.999
No!

01:06:41.347 --> 01:06:43.042
He's gonna
kill you.

01:07:15.248 --> 01:07:17.216
Why are you doing this to us?

01:07:41.007 --> 01:07:42.133
James!

01:07:52.251 --> 01:07:53.513
You're gonna die.

01:07:55.021 --> 01:07:56.613
Kristen, run!

01:08:27.118 --> 01:08:28.245
Let me out!

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:32.085
Kristen! Run!

01:08:43.736 --> 01:08:45.533
Jamie!

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.259
Why are you
doing this to us?

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.095
Because you
were home.

01:11:32.571 --> 01:11:33.799
I love you.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:58.022
Baby!

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:30.391
No! Please! No!

01:12:31.797 --> 01:12:33.526
No! Please!

01:12:35.234 --> 01:12:37.964
You don't have to do this. Please!

01:12:38.304 --> 01:12:42.502
You can stop now.
You... Please! No!

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.373
Please, listen to me. Please.

01:12:45.544 --> 01:12:48.513
You can stop now.
You don't have to do this.

01:12:49.482 --> 01:12:52.144
No!

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.188
Baby, look at me.

01:13:07.563 --> 01:13:09.360
Look at my face.

01:13:13.035 --> 01:13:14.400
Don't look,
please.

01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:24.809
Please! Please!
Please, don't!

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:29.147
No!

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.687
<i>No!</i>

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.918
Can I have one?

01:16:45.697 --> 01:16:47.324
Are you a sinner?

01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:55.731
Sometimes.

01:17:12.223 --> 01:17:14.007
It'll be
easier next time.
