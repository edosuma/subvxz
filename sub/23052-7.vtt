00:40.165 --> 00:42.876
So... what do you think?

00:46.254 --> 00:49.799
During the time between last night
and this morning after it stopped snowing,

00:50.383 --> 00:52.886
an adult male came by and left.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.686
-Let's check out inside.
-Yeah.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.539
The backpack is gone.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.002
And the box with the coal and stove.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.171
He took them away.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.383
Hey, who are you talking about?

01:33.384 --> 01:34.344
The real killer.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.223
A man who committed a murder
in the next town over

01:38.306 --> 01:40.183
and got away with it.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.979
And he's trying
to do the same thing in our town.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.191
<i>I finally told them.</i>

02:00.745 --> 02:03.373
It's just a guess I made,
after I saw the coal

02:04.624 --> 02:06.167
and the contents in the backpack.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.713
You think I'm making too big of a leap?

02:15.051 --> 02:15.885
But I'm...

02:17.512 --> 02:19.597
I'm scared
that someone I know will be killed.

02:20.515 --> 02:24.686
Or maybe get arrested after being framed
for a crime they didn't commit.

02:27.647 --> 02:28.898
It might just seem...

02:29.774 --> 02:32.068
like I'm playing detective, but...

02:37.157 --> 02:38.992
I don't mind playing detective.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.078
I've got a feeling that hunch of yours

02:42.954 --> 02:44.831
will lead us somewhere.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.625
I'm going to choose to believe you.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.133
Me, too.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.594
I want to believe you, too.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.471
Thanks.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.727
<i>So, this is what friendship is?</i>

03:31.169 --> 03:33.004
WE ARE LOOKING FOR AYA NAKANISHI

03:35.548 --> 03:37.008
SHIRATORI REARRESTED
IN CONNECTION TO AYA'S MURDER

03:49.729 --> 03:52.023
<i>In the first timeline's 1988...</i>

03:54.025 --> 03:55.818
SHIRATORI FOODS

04:01.282 --> 04:02.951
<i>I should have been able to help him.</i>

04:04.661 --> 04:05.536
I could have...

04:06.079 --> 04:07.789
I should have been able to...

04:08.873 --> 04:09.707
save him.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.671
I should've been able to save him...

04:15.505 --> 04:17.423
<i>I don't want to feel that way ever again.</i>

04:29.394 --> 04:30.520
You like Wonderguy?

04:35.483 --> 04:36.317
Here. Thanks.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.698
You can have it.
I was gonna throw it away.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.450
<i>I thought I bought it myself.</i>

04:45.326 --> 04:46.619
<i>I guess Yuuki gave it to me.</i> Thank you, Yuuki.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.791
So, did you need something?

04:52.667 --> 04:53.501
Yeah. Yuuki,

04:56.004 --> 04:58.715
do you know a girl named Aya Nakanishi?

04:59.799 --> 05:00.883
Yeah, I do.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.304
She's always alone in the park
by the river.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.850
So, since she's always reading by herself
and looked lonely,

05:09.392 --> 05:11.019
I tried talking to her once.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.397
But she wouldn't really open up to me.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.067
<i>Just as I thought.</i>
<i>Yuuki always tries to talk to kids</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:19.861
<i>who look like they're lonely.</i>

05:20.403 --> 05:22.613
<i>Just like he did with me and Kayo.</i>

05:23.406 --> 05:24.657
That's so like Yuuki.

05:27.952 --> 05:28.911
<i>I said it aloud.</i>

05:58.232 --> 06:03.613
<i>A red fire burns ablaze</i>
<i>Don't lose, stand up</i>

06:03.696 --> 06:07.909
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>
<i>even as an adult I'd put on this record</i>

06:08.284 --> 06:10.578
<i>whenever I wanted to think.</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:25.927
<i>His loving heart is his weapon</i>
<i>A hero who protects you</i>

06:26.010 --> 06:27.762
<i>The killer targets children</i>

06:27.845 --> 06:30.431
<i>who are often alone</i>
<i>for long periods of time.</i>

06:31.307 --> 06:34.644
<i>Aya Nakanishi definitely falls</i>
<i>into that category.</i>

06:35.937 --> 06:38.189
<i>First thing,</i>
<i>I need to make sure she's not alone.</i>

06:39.857 --> 06:42.318
<i>But she goes</i>
<i>to a different school than me.</i>

06:42.985 --> 06:44.028
<i>How do I do this?</i>

06:44.529 --> 06:48.533
HAMANASU CRAM SCHOOL

07:01.963 --> 07:02.964
Let's see.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.216
It ends at 6:30 p.m.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.137
Keyboard lessons at four p.m.,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.932
then she spends some time on a bench
by the old lighthouse,

07:13.349 --> 07:14.892
and then cram school at five p.m.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.146
It sure is a busy schedule.

07:19.647 --> 07:20.481
Satoru,

07:21.691 --> 07:23.943
how did you find a loner like her?

07:24.902 --> 07:27.071
That's some real detective work.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.366
Well,
I thought I might as well do it right.

07:31.075 --> 07:34.620
I'll follow her when she's done
and find out where she lives.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.338
<i>If the killer attempts to make contact,</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:47.925
<i>it will most likely be when</i>
<i>she's walking home from cram school.</i>

07:49.093 --> 07:49.927
Satoru!

07:51.846 --> 07:53.097
Oh, my God, perfect timing.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.391
It's so heavy. Come help me.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.811
-I can't believe this timing.
-<i>I can't believe this timing.</i>

08:03.524 --> 08:05.443
Why did you buy so much at once?

08:07.361 --> 08:08.571
Because they were on sale.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.157
Satoru. Want a ride?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.960
Oh, that way, that way.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.886
You really saved us, Mr. Yashiro.
My mother really went overboard.

08:33.261 --> 08:35.264
-I bet I looked like a superhero.
-Yeah.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.819
Hey, Mr. Yashiro.
Why don't you get married?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.196
What?!

08:50.988 --> 08:52.448
Where'd that come from, Satoru?

08:56.494 --> 08:59.705
Maybe I've gotten too cautious
after going through a bad experience.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.624
Sorry.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.877
Don't worry about it.
I don't mind the question.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.175
-Then can I ask you something else?
-Sure.

09:11.884 --> 09:16.681
How do you approach a girl you don't know,
who you want to be friends with?

09:18.516 --> 09:19.892
Well, let's see.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.770
I'm rather cautious,

09:23.896 --> 09:27.567
so, the first thing I'd try to do is
to get her guard down.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.362
Get her guard down?

09:31.737 --> 09:35.283
Yeah. In other words,
you show off your good side.

09:36.158 --> 09:40.121
Like in my case,
I'm good at sports, I'm good at cooking.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.373
And I'm a public servant.
Use whatever you can.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.711
If she expresses any interest
in any of them, she'll let down her guard.

09:49.046 --> 09:49.880
I see.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.592
I know I can always count on you.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.469
<i>Oh, I said it aloud.</i>

09:56.178 --> 09:58.014
-Satoru, grab me some candy.
-Sure.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.019
-Here.
-Thanks.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.294
What have those guys been up to lately?

10:29.128 --> 10:32.256
Yeah. All three of them
have been acting suspicious.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.641
She's alone again today.
What do you wanna do?

10:43.684 --> 10:45.394
<i>I don't care if she thinks I'm weird.</i>

10:46.937 --> 10:48.064
I'll try talking to her.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.566
<i>I just need to engage her</i>

10:51.108 --> 10:52.485
<i>before it's too late.</i>

10:58.824 --> 10:59.659
Hello.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.995
I'm Satoru Fujinuma
from Mikoto Elementary.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.375
You're Aya Nakanishi, aren't you?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.211
Have we met?

11:10.753 --> 11:11.587
No.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.593
Hey, what book are you reading?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.012
I like reading, too.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.182
It's William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear.</i>

11:24.016 --> 11:24.850
<i>Lear?</i>

11:26.644 --> 11:29.313
That's a pretty hard book you're reading.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.274
Oh, I remember you now.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.987
You're the kids who are always sneaking
into the building across the river.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.489
Our secret base.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.617
I guess you can clearly see it
from this side.

11:42.993 --> 11:43.828
Secret base?

11:45.496 --> 11:47.123
Why are boys so childish?

11:49.708 --> 11:52.169
-Well, I have cram school now.
-Wait!

11:56.757 --> 12:00.052
Secret bases are a man's dream.
Come see for yourself sometime.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.346
Then you'll understand.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.268
I don't see how anybody
would find that fun.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.353
You guys are weirdos.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.983
<i>That couldn't have gone worse.</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:26.245
<i>All I have to do is make sure</i>
<i>she's not alone.</i>

12:26.328 --> 12:27.872
<i>How could it be this hard?</i>

12:29.415 --> 12:30.249
Satoru!

12:54.648 --> 12:55.483
You stupid?

13:13.584 --> 13:18.464
Just like our experiment two days ago,
lenses that are thicker in the middle...

13:18.547 --> 13:19.840
<i>Kayo came back.</i>

13:20.799 --> 13:24.345
<i>They're allowing her to commute here</i>
<i>from her grandmother's by bus.</i>

13:25.179 --> 13:29.266
<i>Kayo said Mr. Yashiro</i>
<i>helped arrange everything.</i>

13:29.725 --> 13:33.187
The light hits the lens and bends,
gathering at a point. The focal point.

13:44.198 --> 13:48.077
And the distance from the lens
to the focal point

13:48.160 --> 13:49.495
is called the focal length.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.417
We haven't been
to the secret base in a while.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.378
-Yeah, let's go, then.
-Yeah.

13:57.836 --> 14:01.006
Satoru, let's go by the secret base.
We can bring Hinazuki.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.383
Secret base...

14:05.094 --> 14:06.303
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

14:06.804 --> 14:09.515
<i>I haven't gone to our secret base</i>
<i>at all since the Revival.</i>

14:17.147 --> 14:18.524
MISSING BOY, HIROMI SUGITA

14:19.358 --> 14:21.986
FIFTH GRADE BOY, POSSIBLY KIDNAPPED

14:24.238 --> 14:26.240
<i>In the first timeline's 1988...</i>

14:28.784 --> 14:30.870
<i>that is where Hiromi's body was found.</i>

14:37.042 --> 14:37.960
<i>In this timeline,</i>

14:38.752 --> 14:40.838
<i>the secret base should be safe</i>
<i>from the crime.</i>

14:42.214 --> 14:45.009
Yeah. That's a good idea. Let's go.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.138
Hey, we're all going by the base.
You're invited, Hinazuki.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.055
Yeah. There.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.729
You really like places like this.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.522
All boys do.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.275
-Satoru.
-What is it?

15:43.776 --> 15:44.985
It's almost four p.m.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.654
Yeah, it's okay.

15:47.029 --> 15:47.863
See?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.032
We can see the lighthouse from here.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.580
She hasn't come yet.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.040
All right.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.172
Who's there?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.803
I decided
to come check your secret base out.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.013
Welcome to our secret base.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.723
Come on in.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.851
-Move, Osamu.
-What? Why do I gotta move?

16:17.935 --> 16:18.936
Thanks for having me.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.146
-Let's play Othello.
-Okay.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.482
I'm pretty good, you know.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.692
Go easy on me.

16:24.942 --> 16:25.943
It'll be fun.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.115
Yes, I'm out.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.420
What do you like to do?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.339
I like to skate.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.094
You got me.

16:53.512 --> 16:57.516
I guess she was drawn
to his boyish charms.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.685
From the looks of it,

17:00.978 --> 17:02.062
Kazu feels the same.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.481
<i>It looks like we unexpectedly</i>

17:05.023 --> 17:07.734
<i>figured out a way to reduce</i>
<i>Aya Nakanishi's time alone.</i>

17:12.531 --> 17:16.785
So, do you plan
to stop playing detective now?

17:17.327 --> 17:18.162
No.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.329
I can't let it end here.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.633
Misato is the worst.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.178
Yeah, totally.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.685
Kayo.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.189
Wanna go to the science center today?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.028
Can we stop somewhere first?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.623
I guess during the day,

18:03.582 --> 18:05.375
it just looks like a plain, bald tree.

18:08.003 --> 18:08.837
You stupid? Hold on.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.476
There's something I need to say to you.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.521
What is it? Thank you.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.742
For leading me out of that place.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.081
You're my...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.043
You're my hero.

18:54.883 --> 18:55.759
Say something.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.524
Get back here.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.404
<i>What I'm doing now is not a waste of time.</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:18.240
<i>I truly believed that.</i>

19:29.543 --> 19:30.669
By the way, Satoru...

19:32.379 --> 19:34.756
Have you noticed
Misato has been alone lately?

19:36.300 --> 19:39.178
What? Is it since the incident
with the lunch money?

19:43.682 --> 19:44.683
I'm a little worried.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.562
Okay. Let's try talking to her on Monday.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.490
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.783
Come get warm.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.334
Hello. I'm Sawada,
a reporter for TV Ishikari.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.378
I'm a friend of your mother's,
and I came to talk.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.590
Oh, nice to meet you.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.133
Nice to meet you.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.597
What's gotten into you?

20:36.318 --> 20:40.072
Would it be okay if I was part
of your conversation, too?

20:42.532 --> 20:46.161
Satoru, are you interested
in becoming a reporter or something?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.663
Something like that.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.248
By the way, Mr. Sawada,

20:50.415 --> 20:53.252
why did you come to our town?

20:54.211 --> 20:55.045
Well...

20:55.587 --> 20:56.463
That's...

20:58.173 --> 21:01.843
Because I thought the person
I was looking for might be here in town.

21:02.886 --> 21:06.682
Are you talking about...
the culprit in the unsolved crimes?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.144
Yes.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.606
-A serial child killer.
-Sawada.

21:15.148 --> 21:18.110
The culprit targets grade school children.
Better that he knows.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.283
There's been one case in Chitose,
and two cases in Sapporo

21:24.908 --> 21:26.785
of young girls being murdered.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.037
That many?

21:29.121 --> 21:29.955
Yes.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.500
A suspect has been arrested
in all of the cases,

21:33.583 --> 21:35.585
but they all deny the allegations.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.879
They swear they're innocent.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.803
So, you think
that the killer is still out there?

21:45.345 --> 21:46.179
Yes.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.474
Criminals like this can't stop themselves.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.144
If the killer is in this town,

21:52.561 --> 21:56.189
it won't be long...
before an incident happens here.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.726
MARCH 14TH (MONDAY)

22:37.355 --> 22:39.232
I might be late tonight.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.653
Fine, but give me a call
when you know you'll be home.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.363
Especially after what Sawada said.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.324
Okay.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.414
-Thanks for the food.
-Yup. Okay.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.543
-Bye.
-Bye, now.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.514
This area gets very little precipitation.
Anybody know where this is?

23:11.181 --> 23:14.643
Since today's the 14th,
we'll go with Takahashi, number 14.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.270
<i>The killer is likely looking</i>
<i>for a new target</i>

23:17.354 --> 23:19.523
<i>to replace the ones I've saved.</i>

23:23.401 --> 23:26.113
<i>I'm sure it's someone very close by.</i>

23:30.158 --> 23:31.701
WALK QUIETLY IN THE HALLS

23:32.744 --> 23:34.579
Do you think we can be friends?

23:35.622 --> 23:36.456
What?

23:39.334 --> 23:41.837
I mean, we both walk
in the same direction to go home.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.549
What's wrong with you?

23:56.476 --> 23:57.310
Sorry.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.729
I wasn't any help at all.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.231
That's not true.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.899
She might not show it,

24:03.441 --> 24:05.902
but I'm pretty sure Misato
doesn't hate you anymore.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.155
You think so?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.907
Yeah. I'll try talking to her next.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.870
Misato said she was going
to go cheer on the hockey team.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.705
Got it. See you later.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.768
Give it all you got!

24:41.021 --> 24:42.731
Let's go, Mikoto Elementary!

24:45.483 --> 24:46.484
You can do it!

24:58.914 --> 24:59.748
Let's go!

24:59.831 --> 25:02.292
Koichi! You don't get food if you lose!

25:02.375 --> 25:03.877
SHIRATORI FOODS

25:03.960 --> 25:05.629
You can do it!

25:05.712 --> 25:07.422
You can do it!

25:08.298 --> 25:09.257
Don't lose!

25:10.258 --> 25:11.676
You better not lose!

25:12.761 --> 25:15.597
You can do it!

25:24.356 --> 25:25.649
You can do it! You can do it!

25:37.869 --> 25:39.246
Go, go, go!

25:39.329 --> 25:40.872
Don't lose!

25:41.790 --> 25:42.791
You can do it!

25:57.138 --> 25:59.349
-Come on!
-You can do it!

25:59.432 --> 26:01.518
Go, go, go!

26:02.060 --> 26:02.894
Nice one! Get it!

26:34.592 --> 26:35.802
Keep pushing them!

26:45.812 --> 26:47.897
RESTROOM

26:50.275 --> 26:52.277
EMERGENCY EXIT

26:59.242 --> 27:00.076
<i>Shiratori?</i>

27:01.828 --> 27:03.371
<i>That's Yuuki's family's truck.</i>

27:07.709 --> 27:08.752
It can't be.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.300
-Satoru? What's up? The bathroom's--
-Mr. Yashiro, great timing.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.886
There's something I have to check now.
Can you help me?
