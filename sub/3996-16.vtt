WEBVTT

00:02.187 --> 00:04.588
Here?
You're dropping me off here?

00:05.156 --> 00:07.724
R-Right in front
of this obvious pickpocket?

00:07.792 --> 00:09.459
Look at the size
of that guy.

00:09.527 --> 00:11.128
He's clearly new homeless.

00:11.195 --> 00:13.263
We're a mile away
from the loft, Cece.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.130
I'm not getting caught with you.

00:14.298 --> 00:16.166
I'm gonna have to run
all the way home.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.516
And I have
my slippiest loafers on.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.401
If I were you, I would
get walking right now.

00:19.403 --> 00:21.137
You're never gonna
get home before dawn.

00:21.204 --> 00:24.106
Okay, look, I'm fine with you
not telling anybody about us,

00:24.174 --> 00:27.343
but you cannot just
call me at anytime

00:27.344 --> 00:29.478
and just summon me
for intercourse.

00:29.546 --> 00:30.779
I have no control here,

00:30.846 --> 00:34.015
and I'm stressed out
all day long.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.950
It's like you're ripping
the side block

00:36.018 --> 00:37.786
out of my mental Jenga.

00:37.853 --> 00:39.487
I'm totally falling apart.

00:39.555 --> 00:41.222
Okay, Schmidt, you...

00:41.290 --> 00:44.125
you really need to
learn to take a breath

00:44.193 --> 00:45.959
and calm down, all right?

00:46.027 --> 00:48.428
We're just being
a little spontaneous.

00:48.496 --> 00:51.165
Words that have never been
used to describe Schmidt:

00:51.232 --> 00:54.034
"spontaneous, flexible,
easy-going."

00:54.102 --> 00:55.903
- I'm like a Marine.
- You're nothing like a Marine.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.971
I'm totally like a Marine, all right?
You know what? Fine...

00:58.039 --> 00:59.840
I'm...
I'm out of here.

01:00.608 --> 01:01.808
Take these,

01:01.875 --> 01:04.010
and take care of them--
I can get a tetanus shot,

01:04.010 --> 01:06.445
but I can't cure
damaged suede.

01:10.317 --> 01:11.000
<i>Can you believe</i>

01:11.001 --> 01:12.101
I found this
on the street?

01:12.102 --> 01:13.286
Who would want
to throw this away?

01:13.354 --> 01:15.554
A blind man who
suddenly recovered his sight?

01:15.872 --> 01:18.056
Get rid of it, Jess--
pine has no place in this loft.

01:18.624 --> 01:20.291
It's the wood of poor
people and outhouses.

01:20.609 --> 01:22.293
I pay rent,
so I think

01:22.461 --> 01:25.097
- that gives me the right to
add a few things.  - Jess...

01:26.464 --> 01:27.432
you're wrong.

01:27.799 --> 01:28.867
Okay?

01:28.868 --> 01:30.002
My answer's no.

01:30.069 --> 01:31.770
Well, my answer is yes.

01:31.838 --> 01:34.105
- I'm keeping the hutch.
- I had a bad night.

01:34.172 --> 01:36.907
I'm really, I'm just asking you,
please d-don't push me.

01:36.975 --> 01:39.443
'Cause then I'll have to reinstate
my ban on high-waisted shorts.

01:39.510 --> 01:40.911
- You would not dare.
- Try me.

01:40.979 --> 01:43.280
That was the worst
four weeks of my life.

02:06.569 --> 02:07.436
Hey, Winston,

02:07.504 --> 02:08.836
why are you still drinking?

02:08.905 --> 02:10.973
It is 10:00 in the morning, man.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.108
Yeah, I know what it'll
feel like when I stop,

02:13.176 --> 02:16.445
so I'm just gonna stay
a little drunk, forever.

02:16.513 --> 02:19.682
Well, why is there no girl
version of <i>you,</i> my man?

02:20.651 --> 02:21.617
Moving on.

02:21.685 --> 02:23.418
So, last night's poker game.

02:23.986 --> 02:24.753
Got pretty intense.

02:24.821 --> 02:26.255
I don't even know what
you're talking about--

02:26.322 --> 02:27.422
I was so hammered last night.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.392
I've never been more sober
in my whole life.

02:29.459 --> 02:31.459
I'll remember this
as long as I live.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.595
I'm all in.
Uno, bitches.

02:34.663 --> 02:36.131
Read 'em and weep.

02:36.949 --> 02:37.999
- Straight flush.
- Aw!

02:38.566 --> 02:39.466
So, what do I owe you, 20 bucks?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.601
- 20 bucks?
- Yeah.

02:41.169 --> 02:43.337
You owe me $487.

02:43.905 --> 02:45.572
Come on, Winston!

02:45.640 --> 02:48.108
Aah! Schmidt
makes me so mad!

02:48.176 --> 02:49.643
I want to put one thing,

02:49.711 --> 02:51.211
one thing in the living room,

02:51.279 --> 02:52.446
and he won't let me.

02:52.514 --> 02:53.670
I'm not putting up with this.

02:53.698 --> 02:54.664
Oh, yes, you are.

02:54.731 --> 02:56.299
We live in a fragile ecosystem.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.767
It's a delicate balance.

02:57.835 --> 02:59.269
It's a broken ecosystem,

02:59.337 --> 03:01.704
- dominated by an apex predator.
- Chill out, Jess.

03:01.772 --> 03:03.639
We let him run the house,
no big deal.

03:03.707 --> 03:06.209
The boy cooks and cleans--
and happily, I might add.

03:06.277 --> 03:07.710
Yeah, he probably
couldn't sleep last night

03:07.778 --> 03:09.812
'cause he was so excited
to clean up after us.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.613
I know he's been
bad lately, but...

03:11.681 --> 03:13.182
Schmidt's an odd bird.

03:13.249 --> 03:14.549
He can't handle
it when things

03:14.617 --> 03:16.218
aren't clean and orderly.

03:16.286 --> 03:18.287
It's been that way
since the day he moved in.

03:18.855 --> 03:21.290
Welcome to your
new home, Schmidt.

03:21.358 --> 03:23.025
Come on, play ball.

03:27.446 --> 03:28.429
Coming home!

03:34.269 --> 03:36.604
Well, I'm fed up with it.

03:36.671 --> 03:38.973
And he's got to
learn how to relax.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.608
And, Nick, why
do you have...

03:40.675 --> 03:42.175
cannons drawn
all over your back?

03:42.243 --> 03:43.210
Those aren't cannons, Jess.

03:43.277 --> 03:44.378
Long-stem mushrooms?

03:44.445 --> 03:45.912
- Nope.
- Oh, so that's...

03:46.480 --> 03:47.580
not a mossy cave.

03:47.648 --> 03:48.482
Mm-mm.

03:48.549 --> 03:49.949
- Mmm, no.
- Probably not.

What is happening...?

04:02.695 --> 04:03.662
I can't take this right now.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.931
What, do we live in a pawnshop?

04:07.133 --> 04:07.866
Hey, Schmidt.

04:07.934 --> 04:09.468
Hey,
Jess. What, uh...

04:10.236 --> 04:11.436
Where did all this come from?

04:11.604 --> 04:13.171
I found the afghan
underneath a Dumpster

04:13.172 --> 04:14.705
outside an animal shelter.

04:14.773 --> 04:17.208
And I found the lamp
underneath the afghan.

04:17.576 --> 04:19.110
I'm gonna assume that
these are your spices

04:19.178 --> 04:20.878
- jammed in here with my spices.
- Yep.

04:20.946 --> 04:23.081
I would really appreciate it
if your non-Tahitian vanilla

04:23.149 --> 04:24.815
was not touching
my Tahitian vanilla.

04:24.883 --> 04:26.984
Oh, Schmidt,
they're more than touching.

04:27.053 --> 04:29.120
What's it like
living in the most populous isle

04:29.188 --> 04:30.820
in French Polynesia?

04:30.888 --> 04:33.524
I could tell you, or...
I could show you.

04:33.591 --> 04:35.359
Not
in front of the cloves.

04:35.427 --> 04:36.693
Where's my burr coffee grinder?

04:36.761 --> 04:38.529
Oh, you know, I
think it's in the hutch.

04:38.596 --> 04:40.297
You put it in the hutch?

04:40.365 --> 04:42.832
The... aah, this thing
was on the <i>street.</i>

04:42.900 --> 04:44.634
It's a coffee grinder, Schmidt.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.335
I think it'll be okay.

04:46.403 --> 04:49.104
A top-of-the-line
conical burr coffee grinder.

04:49.172 --> 04:50.673
You know what that means?
It means it doesn't

04:50.740 --> 04:53.309
smash up the beans like
some pedestrian blade grinder.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.478
It actually
grinds them,

04:55.546 --> 04:58.314
for a deeper, richer, more
satisfying flavor profile!

04:58.382 --> 05:01.116
Oh. Well,
I've used it repeatedly

05:01.117 --> 05:02.551
to make homemade crayons.

05:02.918 --> 05:05.386
Does that show up in your
flavor profile, Schmidt?

05:05.554 --> 05:07.422
Uh, yeah, that's fine.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.057
If you're looking
for your oven mitts,

05:10.125 --> 05:11.159
they're in the top drawer
of the hutch.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.061
Oh. Okay, fair enough.

05:14.129 --> 05:14.829
Hutch is gone.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.797
- No.
- No, no, no.

05:15.864 --> 05:17.399
- - No.    - No hutch.
- No, no!

05:17.967 --> 05:19.533
- Stop! Don't move the hutch.
- Bye-bye, hutch!

05:19.601 --> 05:20.801
This thing makes me
emotionally nauseous!

05:20.868 --> 05:22.703
This is my hutch.
Don't move it!

05:22.770 --> 05:23.704
All right, you're
right, you're right...

05:23.771 --> 05:25.239
I'm so sorry.
You're right.

05:25.307 --> 05:26.540
It's a beautiful piece.

05:26.908 --> 05:29.110
It looks great there.

05:29.877 --> 05:30.877
My apologies.

05:31.445 --> 05:32.413
Thank you.

05:40.153 --> 05:41.154
Oops.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.763
Schmidt, you have
a real problem.

05:52.981 --> 05:55.100
You've got to learn
to calm down.

05:55.818 --> 05:57.002
Yeah, yeah.

06:02.499 --> 06:04.032
I love the beach.

06:04.101 --> 06:06.368
Now, isn't this better
than arguing about a hutch?

06:06.436 --> 06:09.771
Yeah, if you like hanging out on
the rim of a giant fish toilet.

06:09.839 --> 06:12.040
Jess, I can't believe you
brought me down here.

06:12.109 --> 06:14.943
This is a great place
to talk about your problems.

06:15.011 --> 06:17.002
Jess, this sucks--
I just want to go home.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.580
Schmidt, come here.

06:19.148 --> 06:22.050
Look. You got the
birds in the sky.

06:24.586 --> 06:25.754
Sea and sand.

06:26.522 --> 06:28.256
The wind in our hair.

06:30.358 --> 06:31.792
You've lost your kite!

06:31.860 --> 06:34.194
Have fun flying your
string all day!

06:34.262 --> 06:35.929
Sorry I forgot my wallet.

06:35.997 --> 06:37.998
Thank you for paying;
It's delicious.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.634
Yeah, which is weird, because
I clearly remember saying,

06:39.635 --> 06:41.435
"Hey, man, don't
forget your wallet."

06:41.503 --> 06:43.370
- And then I still forgot it.
- You still forget it. Wow, it's weird.

06:43.371 --> 06:45.239
- Yeah, you said that. We're getting older.
- Yeah, I said that.

06:45.306 --> 06:46.940
Okay, this is a good segue.

06:47.008 --> 06:48.007
Um...

06:48.758 --> 06:49.975
can I talk to you

06:49.976 --> 06:51.310
about something that's
kind of tough?

06:53.008 --> 06:54.114
Yeah, man, shoot.

06:54.115 --> 06:57.783
"The subject of this talk is
the debt of money between us.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.385
- I feel that..."
- Oh, man!

06:59.453 --> 07:01.487
I thought this was
about something serious.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.088
You set that up like it was
about something different.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.757
This is about the poker?

07:04.824 --> 07:07.259
Oh, I'll pay you
your money. Relax.

07:11.046 --> 07:12.997
"If I am reading this section,
then I can only assume

07:13.065 --> 07:14.266
"you have told me to relax.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.701
- You wrote that?
- "Let me assure you I am very relaxed,

07:16.769 --> 07:19.304
"although I have good
reason not to be,

07:19.372 --> 07:20.672
"as you owe me
a very large sum."

07:20.739 --> 07:23.004
I will pay you the
money, you clown.

07:23.005 --> 07:24.742
"I am aware that
we're both broke,

07:24.743 --> 07:27.779
"one of us embarrassingly
so. Points to Nick.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.214
"I have recently tumbled down
the socioeconomic ladder

07:30.282 --> 07:31.149
"and have hit rock bottom,

07:31.216 --> 07:33.317
- "where you, Nick Miller,
- Thank you.

07:33.318 --> 07:35.686
"Have been waiting patiently
for the past 15 years.

07:35.753 --> 07:37.003
"But I want that money.

07:37.004 --> 07:39.322
"Give me my money.
I really mean it.

07:39.390 --> 07:41.891
"It's my money.
You owe me that money,

07:41.958 --> 07:44.060
"so give me my
money. Seriously.

07:44.127 --> 07:45.361
- Are you finished?
- "Where is the money, dude?

07:45.429 --> 07:48.097
- You wrote "dude"?
- "But I am not without pity.

07:48.165 --> 07:50.667
I am willing to just
call it an even $200."

07:52.203 --> 07:54.336
Everything let go
with just $200?

07:54.404 --> 07:57.306
- Right.
- All right, I can do $200.

07:57.873 --> 07:59.941
- $200? Two hundo clean?
- Yep.

08:00.509 --> 08:01.509
All right.

08:07.149 --> 08:09.283
I did pay for gas here, though.

08:09.351 --> 08:10.984
So that's, let's say, ten bucks.

08:11.552 --> 08:12.453
So we're at $190.

08:12.521 --> 08:14.788
We'll say clean $190.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.990
I hate to be this guy...

08:17.358 --> 08:19.059
but I got the fights on Friday,

08:19.127 --> 08:21.095
so that's $30.
So let's call it $160

08:21.162 --> 08:23.163
and be done with it.

08:24.933 --> 08:27.768
$20 for beer that night,
so $160 takes us to $140.

08:27.836 --> 08:29.336
Just to be fair.

08:29.404 --> 08:31.438
And I didn't write
a stupid letter about it.

08:31.505 --> 08:32.972
But let's say right now $140.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.006
You ate a lot of the nachos!

08:36.277 --> 08:39.046

08:42.149 --> 08:43.783

08:58.397 --> 08:59.164
No!

08:59.231 --> 09:00.698
No! No, Jess, no!

09:00.767 --> 09:03.801
I can't believe I never noticed
this before, but, Schmidt,

09:03.869 --> 09:05.936
you are legitimately crazy.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.705
I think we're all a little bit
crazy, don't you think, Jess?

09:07.774 --> 09:11.509
No, I mean, you're like aging-
ballerina, child-chess-prodigy,

09:11.577 --> 09:13.277
professional-magician crazy.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.480
It's my mom's fault-- you know,
I come from a Jewish family,

09:16.547 --> 09:19.483
but she used to tell me the reason
Santa didn't come to our house

09:19.550 --> 09:21.017
was because my
room was dirty.

09:21.085 --> 09:23.019
The only thing I ever
controlled was what I ate.

09:23.087 --> 09:25.555
- That's why I got fat.
- Yeah, I got fat 'cause I used to eat

09:25.623 --> 09:28.425
Concord grape jelly from the jar
using a candy bar as a fork.

09:28.493 --> 09:30.593
It's because you didn't
have any structure.

09:30.661 --> 09:32.628
You know what I mean?
That's what happens

09:32.696 --> 09:33.663
when you don't
have any rules.

09:33.730 --> 09:36.899
None of these people have rules.
Especially that guy.

09:36.966 --> 09:38.701
He's wearing ladies'
bikini bottoms.

09:38.769 --> 09:41.036
Jess, I'm not
like these people, okay?

09:41.104 --> 09:44.540
I don't have dreadlocks.
I don't own a snake.

09:44.608 --> 09:46.441
And I don't understand how these
people think that they're relaxed,

09:46.509 --> 09:48.776
because they're not-- they
just have nothing to do.

09:48.794 --> 09:51.180
That's not me.
It's not that easy for me.

09:51.247 --> 09:53.815
Sounds to me like a lot
of excuses, Schmidt.

09:53.882 --> 09:55.784
Just be spontaneous.

10:28.681 --> 10:29.849
Hey, Nick.

10:30.217 --> 10:31.984
Look, man, I'm sorry to bother
you while you're clearly

10:31.985 --> 10:33.819
sitting here working hard
making lots of money.

10:33.887 --> 10:36.388
- All right. - But if you'd kindly
just pause that for one second,

10:36.456 --> 10:38.623
I have a few accounts
that I'd like to settle.

10:39.191 --> 10:40.459
Account number one:

10:40.526 --> 10:43.428
A $15 receipt for a
Chinatown box turtle.

10:43.496 --> 10:45.764
- Bam. Here we go.
- We're doing this, huh?

10:45.832 --> 10:48.166
- - Yeah, we are doing this. - Great
- Item number two:

10:48.234 --> 10:52.069
Cancelled $35 check for
registration of a domain name--

10:52.136 --> 10:53.671
"It's Nick Miller Time.com."

10:53.739 --> 10:56.000
"Hey, guys, Winston,
I got a good idea, man.

10:56.001 --> 10:57.041
I'm gonna be a
big-time blogger."

10:57.109 --> 10:58.709
- I have to go to work...
- Uh-huh.

10:58.777 --> 11:01.579
...At a bar, where
<i>you</i> drink for free.

11:01.646 --> 11:02.883
- Wow.
- How much does four

11:02.884 --> 11:05.215
hundred cognac and colas
add up to, Winston?

11:05.383 --> 11:06.116
- You want to go there?
- Yeah.

11:06.117 --> 11:07.518
Okay. How about all the
times I sat around

11:07.519 --> 11:09.052
listening to you
bitch and moan

11:09.120 --> 11:11.521
about how Caroline broke
your precious little heart?

11:11.589 --> 11:14.123
- Okay, in eighth grade...
- Eighth grade.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.726
- ...You "accidentally" saw
my mom naked.     - Mm-hmm.

11:16.794 --> 11:19.862
Before she stopped exercising
and let herself get chubby.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.130
Okay?

11:21.131 --> 11:22.498
So how much is that,
in terms of money?

11:22.565 --> 11:24.033
'Cause I haven't
gotten over that.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.902
- And I would say four to $5,000.
- Hey, guys. Hey, guys.

11:26.969 --> 11:29.305
Schmidt, Winston saw my mother naked
in eighth grade; in terms of mon--

11:29.306 --> 11:32.207
I waded into the ocean
without my aqua socks.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.341
Mm, he did.

11:33.410 --> 11:34.476
He let go.

11:39.081 --> 11:41.315
He washed his hands
in a public restroom.

11:41.383 --> 11:42.883
And there was a man in there.

11:42.951 --> 11:45.520
And he was using the toilet,
full sit, no door.

11:45.588 --> 11:46.887
And I didn't break
eye contact.

11:47.055 --> 11:47.688
Not once.

11:47.756 --> 11:50.224
That's not letting go,
that's cruising.

11:51.527 --> 11:52.728
Hey, Schmidt.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.495
- There's a spill.
- I know.

11:55.563 --> 11:57.197
Do your exercise. You know.

11:57.265 --> 11:59.599
Yeah, okay, the exercise.

12:01.502 --> 12:06.206
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

12:07.909 --> 12:09.209
I feel great.

12:09.277 --> 12:11.004
I'm gonna go take a shower
with Nick's bar soap,

12:11.005 --> 12:12.479
like a common ranch hand.

12:13.547 --> 12:16.782
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! - What is going on?

12:17.050 --> 12:18.351
You messed with the ecosystem.

12:18.519 --> 12:20.086
And you guys said
it couldn't be done.

12:20.154 --> 12:22.055
You have no idea
what you're getting into.

12:22.123 --> 12:23.623
You're welcome.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.784
<i>Schmidt, you're killing
with me with that drumming!</i>

12:30.852 --> 12:32.486
You're killing me!

12:32.487 --> 12:35.321
Look at this mess.
How did this happen?

12:35.390 --> 12:36.790
So, this is your fault.

12:36.858 --> 12:38.625
No. No.

12:38.693 --> 12:40.059
This is good for Schmidt.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.828
'Cause you guys have been
taking advantage of him

12:41.896 --> 12:43.296
for years.

12:43.364 --> 12:45.030
You make him cook,
you make him clean...

12:45.098 --> 12:46.665
Where's my money, dude?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.234
Frankly, it's... sexist.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.003
Oh, my God. Ew!

12:51.070 --> 12:52.271
How's it sexist?

12:53.088 --> 12:54.039
Who's cleaning up?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.275
- I cleaned this morning.
- All right, fine.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.343
- I'll clean, you guys go to the store.
- Act like an adult.

12:58.412 --> 12:59.677
I'm not going
to the store with him.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.580
- Where's my money, dude...?
- Stop throwing things at each other.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.982
- Oh, come on.
- Where is the money?

13:05.350 --> 13:06.183
You're a child.

13:06.251 --> 13:07.652
...My car, too, while you...

13:07.720 --> 13:08.787
Silence, friends!

13:08.854 --> 13:10.388
I made you necklaces.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.390
Hey, do you want
to go to the store?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.492
Please, God, yes.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.561
$100? How did Schmidt buy all
these groceries with 100 bucks?

13:17.629 --> 13:19.329
- It's only $100?
- $100.

13:19.397 --> 13:21.004
You should've told... we have
way too much stuff, man.

13:21.005 --> 13:23.166
- Yeah, like shrimp cocktail.
- We don't need a baked ham.

13:23.234 --> 13:24.568
- All right.
- Winston?

13:25.386 --> 13:26.369
- Sorry about that.
- Really? Really?

13:27.138 --> 13:28.171
Two cake mixes?

13:28.239 --> 13:30.307
- Really? All these soups?
- Pizza? Frozen pizza?

13:30.374 --> 13:31.874
You fat ass. What are you trying to do, die?
Shut up, dude.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.843
We have enough ketchup.
We have enough ketchup! Come on, really?

13:33.911 --> 13:35.311
Next, please.

13:35.378 --> 13:36.512
Oh, hey, how you doing, sir?

13:36.580 --> 13:38.247
We only have $100, Gary,

13:38.315 --> 13:40.349
so could you stop checking us
out when we hit $100?

13:40.417 --> 13:41.884
Yeah, you got to
include tax, too,

13:41.952 --> 13:43.986
- so, like, $93, just... Cool?
- Yeah, just that'll do.

13:44.054 --> 13:45.087
Okay, guys.

13:45.155 --> 13:47.022
- Thanks. - I'm gonna put
my stuff at the front,

13:47.090 --> 13:49.524
- 'cause you obviously don't know how
to shop.   - You're being ridiculous.

13:49.592 --> 13:51.426
- Are you getting me?
- We have enough ketchup.

13:52.494 --> 13:53.394
Epsom salt?

13:53.463 --> 13:55.129
- Yeah, okay. - What, are you
too good for regular salt?

13:55.197 --> 13:56.965
You know damn well
I got to soak my trick foot.

13:57.032 --> 13:58.934
Oh, Winnie, your
little trick foot.

13:59.001 --> 14:00.969
Yeah, my trick foot,
and don't ever call me Winnie.

14:01.036 --> 14:02.403
- Aw, Winnie...
- Fine.

14:02.972 --> 14:03.938
You don't owe me anything.

14:04.005 --> 14:05.539
The slate is clean.
We're good, we're even.

14:05.607 --> 14:06.907
Oh, good, that's
how I feel, too.

14:06.975 --> 14:09.643
Because in my mind, your mom
will always be the winner

14:09.711 --> 14:11.812
- of Best Boobs.
- Really, Best Boobs?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.547
- Yeah. Master's Division.
- You're gonna talk about my mother?

14:13.615 --> 14:14.882
You're gonna talk
about my mom's boobs?

14:14.950 --> 14:16.049
Is that...
you gonna go there?

14:16.117 --> 14:17.351
Don't push me
in a supermarket, man.

14:17.918 --> 14:19.186
You started this.

14:21.253 --> 14:22.789
- Did you just slap me in the face?
- No, I did not.

14:22.857 --> 14:24.591
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:28.829 --> 14:30.497
I'm not afraid of you, man.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.833
Don't act your...

14:39.071 --> 14:40.138
Grow up, dude!

14:42.441 --> 14:44.342
Hey, Schmidt.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.111
Oh, hello, Jess.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.546
- Hey.
- What are you doing out here?

14:47.614 --> 14:51.049
Oh, just checking
up on you.

14:51.867 --> 14:52.917
Oh, I see you're
eating street meat

14:52.985 --> 14:54.451
wrapped in street meat.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.488
This is my man, Gordon.

14:56.555 --> 14:59.056
You've outdone yourself
once again, Gordon.

14:59.124 --> 15:00.491
Excellent.

15:00.559 --> 15:02.059
- Did you go to work today?
- No, no. No work.

15:02.427 --> 15:03.661
I haven't been there in a while.

15:03.729 --> 15:05.763
- How long is a while?
- I don't know. Three days?

15:05.831 --> 15:09.566
Schmidt, I made a mistake
in bringing you down here.

15:10.134 --> 15:12.135
I shouldn't have done that.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.503
Please come home.

15:13.771 --> 15:14.938
Why?

15:15.306 --> 15:16.840
So I can cook and clean?

15:16.908 --> 15:19.342
So I can show you
where the vacuum is?

15:19.910 --> 15:21.611
All right.

15:21.679 --> 15:24.179
Okay, fine, I don't know
where the vacuum is.

15:24.547 --> 15:26.215
That is one reason
why I came here,

15:26.732 --> 15:28.583
but I really want
you to come home.

15:28.651 --> 15:31.353
Everything's falling apart
without you.

15:31.421 --> 15:34.423
Nick and Winston
are fighting all the time.

15:34.490 --> 15:37.259
And all of us lost our keys
to the mailbox.

15:37.326 --> 15:40.001
Schmidt, just listen
to me, because you

15:40.029 --> 15:42.363
don't belong here, like, really.

15:42.431 --> 15:43.431
Do you remember when you

15:43.498 --> 15:45.933
got yourself off
to <i>An Inconvenient Truth?</i>

15:46.000 --> 15:47.734
How about when
you dress up

15:47.802 --> 15:51.105
like Shia Labeouf from
<i>Wall Street Two</i> for Halloween?

15:51.473 --> 15:52.774
Do you remember
when you said

15:52.841 --> 15:56.043
jazz music was America's
greatest mistake?

15:56.110 --> 15:58.478
Say it in drums, Jessica Day.

15:58.546 --> 16:00.281
<i>Me hablo</i> drums.

16:03.550 --> 16:04.184
Hey, man.

16:04.185 --> 16:05.852
I got the last frozen thing.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.122
I was gonna ice my wrist, but...

16:09.690 --> 16:11.157
How about this?

16:11.525 --> 16:12.692
Take half, pal.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.293
So kind of you.

16:15.829 --> 16:17.897
That hurts, man.

16:19.699 --> 16:21.100
I am so hungry.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.735
Remember those things that
Schmidt used to make us

16:22.803 --> 16:25.705
with the peanut butter
and the raisins on the celery?

16:26.272 --> 16:27.206
What were those called?

16:27.273 --> 16:28.106
Ants on a log.

16:28.173 --> 16:29.774
Ants on a log.

16:29.842 --> 16:31.977
I just got why they're called
ants on a log.

16:32.794 --> 16:34.145
Looks like ants on a log.

16:34.713 --> 16:35.947
I'm hungry, man.

16:36.015 --> 16:37.849
Hey, Schmidt,
is that you, buddy?

16:38.217 --> 16:40.018
No, it's me.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.385
What the hell happened to you?

16:41.453 --> 16:42.654
I went down to the beach,

16:42.722 --> 16:44.622
and I tried to talk to Schmidt,

16:44.689 --> 16:46.490
but he just ignored me,

16:46.557 --> 16:48.759
and he went back to twirling
his fire baton.

16:49.127 --> 16:51.194
He's really bad;
He burned a lot of people.

16:51.262 --> 16:53.597
I feel like they should let you
twirl it around a few times

16:53.665 --> 16:55.365
before they actually
light it on fire.

16:55.433 --> 16:56.867
Well, look, Jess,
being friends with Schmidt

16:56.935 --> 16:58.902
is really complicated.

16:58.970 --> 17:00.103
'Cause you want
to change him

17:00.170 --> 17:01.871
so badly,

17:01.939 --> 17:04.807
but you can't
'cause he'll just get worse.

17:04.875 --> 17:08.477
You guys were right,
I upset the ecosystem.

17:09.045 --> 17:10.847
This is not what I wanted.

17:11.414 --> 17:14.282
I just wanted
to put my hutch here.

17:14.351 --> 17:16.852
Make the place my own,
be a part of the family.

17:16.919 --> 17:18.353
What family?
With these clowns?

17:18.420 --> 17:20.623
Yeah, you clowns.

17:20.690 --> 17:22.290
Well, look,
you want in, you're in.

17:22.358 --> 17:25.127
Congratulations,
welcome to the family, Jess.

17:25.194 --> 17:26.094
Aww.

17:26.163 --> 17:28.530
Yeah, we don't "aww"
in this family.

17:37.471 --> 17:38.104
Hey, guys.

17:38.173 --> 17:38.973
Hey, Schmidt.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.008
Um, we need to talk.

17:43.644 --> 17:45.179
Something not cool?

17:49.362 --> 17:50.796
Schmidt, we miss you.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.463
You just want me to clean.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.032
No, that's not true.

17:54.099 --> 17:55.299
- Well, it's a little bit true.
- There's truth to that.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.766
Okay, look.
I want you to clean.

17:56.835 --> 17:58.768
Look, we're so proud of you

17:58.837 --> 18:00.470
for letting go, and relaxing.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.872
But this isn't like you.

18:02.940 --> 18:05.441
You can run away
from your problems, but

18:05.508 --> 18:07.576
you're just gonna find
new ones that pop up

18:07.644 --> 18:08.978
like hepatitis.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.779
And Nick and Winston

18:10.848 --> 18:13.716
want to say to you
that they really miss you.

18:13.783 --> 18:14.851
You're freaking
me out, man.

18:14.918 --> 18:16.652
Why are you wearing
that crystal around your neck?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.686
Nick, the crystal
symbolizes energy.

18:18.754 --> 18:20.889
All a crystal is
is rock poo, Schmidt.

18:20.957 --> 18:22.657
Look, I need
you, Schmidt.

18:23.225 --> 18:26.561
Okay, I need you to tell me
what pants not to wear

18:26.628 --> 18:28.696
and to exercise
more often.

18:28.764 --> 18:30.198
I need you to make fun
of me when I call

18:30.266 --> 18:32.567
a panini a hot sandwich;
How am I ever gonna learn?

18:32.634 --> 18:33.601
I even miss

18:33.669 --> 18:34.768
your hair chutney.

18:34.836 --> 18:37.004
Without you,
man, we're just

18:37.072 --> 18:38.839
three idiots
who live together.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.409
You make us a family.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.814
Well, I'm the cool
rebel brother.

18:47.883 --> 18:49.283
- You're the mom. - The mother. - Mom.

18:49.351 --> 18:50.750
Look, Schmidt,
if you come back

18:50.817 --> 18:54.287
to us, I'll let you
clean my room.

18:55.655 --> 18:57.290
The white whale?

18:57.358 --> 19:00.226
Think about how many
dust bunnies are under my bed.

19:00.594 --> 19:01.660
How many stray socks.

19:01.928 --> 19:02.896
Hey, Schmidt,

19:03.463 --> 19:04.663
I got you something.

19:04.731 --> 19:06.464
Is that a boutique box?

19:06.532 --> 19:11.270
A pair of gray, shiny, twill,
flat-front trousers

19:12.037 --> 19:14.373
designed by a man named Calvin.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.442
Never been tried on.

19:16.510 --> 19:18.643
Pockets are sewn shut.

19:18.711 --> 19:20.812
Don't you just want to get
your thumbs in there

19:20.880 --> 19:22.846
and rip?

19:23.715 --> 19:25.216
Okay, so, I'm just
gonna leave this

19:25.284 --> 19:26.550
on your bongo drum,

19:27.368 --> 19:29.486
and you can, you know,

19:29.554 --> 19:31.822
give them a whirl
if you feel like it.

19:36.395 --> 19:38.262
Just make the
right decision.

19:39.330 --> 19:40.663
Come home.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.800
Take the pants.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.976
Oh, come here.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.651
Calvin.

20:02.718 --> 20:05.321
You magnificent wizard.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.796
Scmidtty.

20:17.264 --> 20:18.887
Nick, your hair
is doing that thing

20:18.900 --> 20:20.101
that I just... I just hate.

20:20.669 --> 20:22.270
And Jess, can you please
ask Winston to help you

20:22.338 --> 20:24.105
move the furniture out?
He could use the exercise.

20:24.173 --> 20:26.340
You're looking a little,
you know...

20:26.407 --> 20:28.307
- He's back.
- And Nick, Winston,

20:28.576 --> 20:29.409
we have a urinal.

20:29.477 --> 20:31.144
How are you still missing?

20:31.712 --> 20:32.779
<i>Schmidt?</i>

20:33.347 --> 20:34.581
Schmidt, wake up.

20:34.648 --> 20:36.583
Hey, hey.

20:36.650 --> 20:37.985
Hey.

20:38.052 --> 20:38.986
Hey!

20:41.621 --> 20:42.788
What...

20:42.856 --> 20:44.256
are you doing here?

20:44.324 --> 20:45.758
What do you think
I'm doing here? Come on!

20:49.062 --> 20:50.964
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

20:51.531 --> 20:52.198
Cece,

20:52.265 --> 20:53.766
before we continue,

20:53.834 --> 20:56.302
I clearly have no control
in this relationship,

20:56.370 --> 20:59.571
and... I'm fine with it.

20:59.639 --> 21:01.507
- Good.
- But know this,

21:01.574 --> 21:03.409
you're the one who broke
into this apartment at 3:00 a.m.

21:03.410 --> 21:04.576
for a little bit
of this Schmidt, so

21:04.644 --> 21:06.778
who's really in control?

21:06.846 --> 21:07.980
Shut up!

21:14.653 --> 21:16.654
Wait, oh, are you
sleeping in dress pants?

21:16.722 --> 21:18.255
What? They're slacks.

21:18.323 --> 21:20.525
- What's the big deal?
Calm down.   - Oh...

21:21.992 --> 21:24.194
Look how excited
Hector J. is to see you.

21:24.262 --> 21:25.896
Yeah, I've already
met Hector J., so...

21:25.963 --> 21:28.331
- Ooh, look, he's knighting you.
- Oh, no, please stop knighting me.

21:28.332 --> 21:29.033
- Don't...
- Lady Cecelia...

21:29.034 --> 21:29.967
No, Schmidt,
I'm gonna leave.

21:29.968 --> 21:32.036
You have entered the
order of the round table.

21:32.103 --> 21:33.837
I'm getting my bag, okay,
I'm gonna get my...

21:33.905 --> 21:35.972
- Oh, I want to stay.
- Dame Nasty Cece.
