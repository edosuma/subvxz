We're gonna have
a new boardroom,

00:23.167 --> 00:26.125

so many would be here today,

Diane Oetting:
Hi, everybody.
(clears throat)

00:31.000 --> 00:32.375
Two years ago,

00:32.459 --> 00:36.751
the board was concerned
by the continued refusal

00:36.834 --> 00:38.584
on the part of Mr. Weger

00:38.667 --> 00:43.292
to accept any responsibility
or express any remorse.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.459
The board felt that
a release at that time

00:46.542 --> 00:49.292
could jeopardize public safety.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.626
This was two years ago.

00:51.709 --> 00:55.000
If you let him go today,

00:55.083 --> 00:58.876
does that mean that
the crime wasn't brutal?

00:58.959 --> 01:02.542
Does that mean
he is expressing remorse?

01:02.626 --> 01:04.375
No.

01:04.459 --> 01:09.083
We've been fighting this
for 40 years.

01:09.167 --> 01:14.751
Our family has been accused
of being part of the mob.

01:14.834 --> 01:19.500
My grandfather was accused
of setting up a hit,

01:19.584 --> 01:22.709
and my grandmother
and her friends

01:22.792 --> 01:28.584
were going out
to look at birds.

01:29.876 --> 01:31.542
Thank you.

01:33.751 --> 01:36.584
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'm Chester's sister.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.375
He is two years older
than what I am.

01:39.459 --> 01:42.083
He was my closest sibling,

01:42.167 --> 01:45.918
and he has always
maintained his innocence.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.125
He has lost his life
as you all know.

01:50.209 --> 01:54.042
I just hope my brother
does not die in prison.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.292
Thank you.

01:56.375 --> 02:00.584
If there's nothing further,
I'll ask Janet to take the roll.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.167
If he receives eight votes,
he will be paroled.

<i>I had never heard
of the Starved Rock murders.</i>

05:45.876 --> 05:48.542
I wasn't born in 1960,
but I read--

05:48.626 --> 05:51.834
It was a front-page article
in<i> The Chicago Tribune</i>
about Chester Weger,

05:51.918 --> 05:55.083
<i>"Starved Rock Killer
Denied Parole Again," right?</i>

05:55.167 --> 05:57.542
<i>So, I was really intrigued.</i>

05:57.626 --> 06:01.834
<i>This guy's
maintained his innocence
over decades and decades.</i>

06:01.918 --> 06:05.125
So, I decided
to write Chester Weger a letter.

06:07.292 --> 06:09.459
<i>You know, when you look
at false confessions,</i>

06:09.542 --> 06:12.667
<i>and there are certain factors
that lead to wrongful
confessions,</i>

06:12.751 --> 06:14.584
<i>the primary one
is the threat of death.</i>

<i>Here you have uncontested
evidence that Chester</i>

06:18.459 --> 06:21.542
<i>was threatened multiple times
with the death penalty.</i>

06:21.626 --> 06:23.709
<i>The second thing
is all the surveillance.</i>

06:23.792 --> 06:25.500
<i>The thing's
to break somebody's will,</i>

06:25.584 --> 06:28.292
<i>and the coercion
and the techniques,</i>

06:28.375 --> 06:31.167
<i>it has all the hallmarks

06:31.250 --> 06:35.167
Our first goal was just let's,
let's get him out of prison.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.584
<i>But I think
the more important step</i>

12:08.000 --> 12:09.959
<i>on both the victims' side
and the defense side.</i>

12:10.042 --> 12:12.250
I mean, Chester Weger's son
has gone to prison,

12:12.334 --> 12:13.751
several times.

12:13.834 --> 12:18.542
<i>A lot of his behavior
has been as a sexual deviant.</i>

12:18.626 --> 12:22.626
<i>It's hard to say if it's
because of him being the son</i>

12:22.709 --> 12:24.167
<i>of the Starved Rock murderer,</i>

12:24.250 --> 12:27.751
<i>or if he's just made
these choices on his own.</i>

12:27.834 --> 12:31.125
Johnny:
<i>All I ever heard</i>
<i>from the courts,</i>

12:31.209 --> 12:36.167
<i>from the people I've met was,
"You're just like your father."</i>

12:36.250 --> 12:38.542
It's gonna affect ya.

12:38.626 --> 12:41.125
<i>61 years old,</i>

12:41.209 --> 12:44.000
<i>the drugs and alcohol
I put in my body,</i>

12:44.083 --> 12:46.500
<i>and the mess
I put my body through.</i>

12:46.584 --> 12:48.792
I'm here.

12:48.876 --> 12:51.167
They say I don't have a brain,

12:51.250 --> 12:52.959
well, let me tell ya this one.

12:53.042 --> 12:55.584
This is called "Woe is Me."

12:55.667 --> 12:58.042
"Again the shadow's loneliness

12:58.125 --> 13:00.834
"have begun to transverse
the passageways of my heart.

13:00.918 --> 13:04.209
"I'm just a lonely prisoner
caged in a man-made hell,

13:04.292 --> 13:07.834
"and this pain and anguish
I suffer is more than
I can tell.

13:07.918 --> 13:10.125
<i>"Memories, without them
I couldn't live,</i>

13:10.209 --> 13:12.626
<i>"for in my mind's eye,
I can see you clearly,</i>

13:12.709 --> 13:15.876
<i>so if there'd be no memories,
then there'd be no you."</i>

13:17.709 --> 13:20.334
<i>I went through 30 years
of prison,</i>

13:20.417 --> 13:23.125
and totally lost my mind.

13:23.209 --> 13:27.125
In prison, that's
all you have is memories.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.792
My father, he taught me

13:31.876 --> 13:37.125
how to love and to care
about somebody besides myself.

13:39.918 --> 13:43.167
<i>They say he's supposed to have
another chance in court,</i>

13:43.250 --> 13:47.626
but they couldn't pay him enough
for 60 years of heartache,

13:47.709 --> 13:50.500
his parents dying,
his wife dying,

13:50.584 --> 13:52.334
his kids suffering.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.584
They couldn't give him enough.

14:07.375 --> 14:08.959
Andy:
<i>I've never been here before.</i>

14:09.042 --> 14:11.751
<i>I can't believe
how scenic it is.</i>

14:11.834 --> 14:13.834
<i>Now that I see this,</i>

14:13.918 --> 14:16.876
<i>you know, the story that
is set forth in the confession</i>

14:16.959 --> 14:18.959
<i>makes zero sense.</i>

14:19.042 --> 14:20.250
<i>And how high it is.</i>

14:20.334 --> 14:22.375
All the struggle to get
the bodies up here,

14:22.459 --> 14:24.292
which, how long's
that gonna take you?

14:24.375 --> 14:27.751
And risk having somebody else
walk into the canyon?

14:27.834 --> 14:31.209
That to me is the bigger risk,
not a plane in the sky.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.876
There's hikers,
there's people here.

14:32.959 --> 14:37.834
To drag three grown women
up into that cave,

14:37.918 --> 14:41.626
<i>it strikes me so much more
as being a two-man job.</i>

14:44.250 --> 14:47.709
<i>If you go back and look
at all the newspaper articles,</i>

14:47.792 --> 14:49.250
<i>you see
the complete focus being,</i>

14:49.334 --> 14:51.083
<i>this is a crime
committed by two people</i>

14:51.167 --> 14:53.959
<i>because of the hairs.</i>

14:54.042 --> 14:57.250
<i>There was all kinds
of hair evidence
collected at the scene,</i>

14:57.334 --> 15:01.584
and there was
no hair evidence introduced
against Chester at trial.

15:01.667 --> 15:06.167
<i>There were 18 hairs
found in Ms. Oetting's hand,</i>

15:06.250 --> 15:10.250
<i>and there were seven hairs
found on Ms. Murphy's glove.</i>

15:10.334 --> 15:14.667
<i>It clearly looks like the hairs
of the attackers,</i>

15:14.751 --> 15:18.375
<i>and there's
this 1960 lab report that says</i>

15:18.459 --> 15:21.125
<i>it's not Chester's hair
on the glove.</i>

15:21.209 --> 15:24.334
That to me, for sure, would've
been reasonable doubt

15:24.417 --> 15:25.584
back in the day,

15:25.667 --> 15:28.834
<i>and it wasn't even
introduced at the trial.</i>

15:28.918 --> 15:30.959
(suspenseful music playing)

15:32.250 --> 15:34.459
<i>I wanna test those for DNA.</i>

15:34.542 --> 15:36.250
The argument being used
against us is,

15:36.334 --> 15:38.626
"Oh, well, it's all been
commingled and contaminated."

15:38.709 --> 15:40.292
Oh, well, that's great.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.792
So, the guys that we're claiming
caused this guilty verdict

15:43.876 --> 15:45.417
can contaminate
all the evidence,

15:45.500 --> 15:47.667
and prevent Chester
from even looking at it?

15:47.751 --> 15:49.125
Oh, isn't that convenient?

15:49.209 --> 15:51.292
<i>I retained an expert.</i>

15:51.375 --> 15:53.584
<i>He has a lab called Microtrace.</i>

15:53.667 --> 15:55.667
<i>His name is Skip Palenik,</i>

15:55.751 --> 15:58.042
<i>and his son Chris
works there as well.</i>

15:58.125 --> 15:59.459
<i>Skip Palenik is world-renowned.</i>

15:59.542 --> 16:01.417
I mean, he's worked
with Scotland Yard.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.459
He's worked on the, you know,
the Green River Murders,

16:03.542 --> 16:04.918
the JonBenét Ramsey case.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.459
<i>I mean, I could go
on and on and on.</i>

16:09.876 --> 16:13.250
Chris Palenik:
<i>Back in 1960, somebody</i>
<i>took a glass microscope slide,</i>

16:13.334 --> 16:16.083
<i>put the materials down,
added a mounting medium,</i>

16:16.167 --> 16:18.959
<i>it hardened,
and a cover slip on top.</i>

16:19.042 --> 16:22.167
<i>And so, that evidence
is embedded in
the microscope slide.</i>

16:22.250 --> 16:25.667
You can pick it up,
you can hand it around,
you can pass it around.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.500
-You could lick it.
-You could lick it.

16:27.584 --> 16:29.584
And everything that's
in there is preserved.

16:29.667 --> 16:34.876
<i>Even since 2004, DNA technology
has advanced in great strides,</i>

16:34.959 --> 16:38.626
<i>so it's, most likely, still
material with evidential value.</i>

16:38.709 --> 16:42.834
Andy:
<i>One of the crucial things to</i>
<i>remember about Chester's case</i>

16:42.918 --> 16:45.417
<i>is the trial took
place in 1961,</i>

16:45.500 --> 16:48.959
prior to Supreme Court case
Brady v. Maryland,

16:49.042 --> 16:51.751
which said, "The state
has to turn over

16:51.834 --> 16:54.626
<i>any exculpatory information
to the defense."</i>

16:54.709 --> 16:58.125
<i>So, this report, that the hairs
did not match Chester Weger,</i>

16:58.209 --> 17:01.584
they were under no obligation,
legally, to turn it over.

17:01.667 --> 17:04.083
David:
<i>That's not his job.</i>

17:04.167 --> 17:05.542
<i>This was pre-Brady.</i>

17:05.626 --> 17:08.250
Let's be honest,
is it my father's job

17:08.334 --> 17:12.209
to fight for what evidence
was brought into the trial?

17:12.292 --> 17:16.709
<i>That's McNamara's job,
the job of the defense.</i>

17:16.792 --> 17:21.542
However, I'm sure hoping
Andy Hale and his team

17:21.626 --> 17:24.667
<i>have that opportunity.
I hope that happens.</i>

17:27.209 --> 17:29.375
Reporter:

<i>That's after almost
60 years behind bars.</i>

17:35.876 --> 17:37.000
Reporter 2:
Welcome to Chicago.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.500
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

17:38.584 --> 17:39.959
Reporter 3:
How do you feel, Chester?

17:40.042 --> 17:41.834
Reporter 4:

17:45.959 --> 17:49.375

17:49.459 --> 17:51.584
(Reporter speaking)

17:51.667 --> 17:52.709
-It's wonderful.
-Yeah.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.083
It's, it's almost
hard to describe.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.167
I mean, it's been, it's been

17:55.250 --> 17:56.500
-our whole lifetime.
-It's surreal, yeah.

17:56.584 --> 17:57.542

17:58.667 --> 17:59.584
Carrie:
He's exhausted, sorry.

17:59.667 --> 18:00.876
Nita:
He can't, he can't. Thank you.

18:04.209 --> 18:07.209
-David:
I'm David. Do you remember me?
-Chester: I remember you, David.

18:07.292 --> 18:09.000
-You look great.
-You look great, too.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.125
You look healthy.
You look fantastic.

18:11.209 --> 18:14.292
-You look good.
-Well, what a place to see you.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.167
I'm, I'm happy to see you.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.125
<i>Don't you find it
hard to believe</i>

18:18.209 --> 18:21.500
<i>that somebody from
a normal working class family,</i>

18:21.584 --> 18:23.667
<i>raised in this area,</i>

18:23.751 --> 18:25.417
<i>what, what would have
caused him</i>

18:25.500 --> 18:27.751
<i>to all of a sudden
bludgeon three women to death?</i>

18:27.834 --> 18:31.250
Anthony:
<i>The true story is</i>
<i>with Chester Weger himself,</i>

18:31.334 --> 18:33.792
<i>and he'll never
tell the truth in this case.</i>

18:33.876 --> 18:36.125
<i>Chester was
a different type of person,</i>

18:36.209 --> 18:37.751
<i>and those were things that,</i>

18:37.834 --> 18:39.459
<i>evidence that the public
doesn't know about.</i>

18:39.542 --> 18:43.000
<i>Past history, past experiences
that he had,</i>

18:43.083 --> 18:45.292
<i>and, and it just fit.</i>

18:45.375 --> 18:49.000
David:
<i>My father never said this to me</i>
<i>until I was making this film,</i>

18:49.083 --> 18:53.000
but he believed there was
more to the scenario

18:53.083 --> 18:54.459
than what was in the confession.

18:54.542 --> 18:58.209
He thought there might have been
a sexual motivation.

18:58.292 --> 19:01.584
<i>Looking at a story
over 60 years,</i>

19:01.667 --> 19:03.876
you, you have to go back
to those tidbits,

19:03.959 --> 19:07.667
those little things
that answer questions.

19:07.751 --> 19:11.125
<i>A lot of my communication
with Chester</i>

19:11.209 --> 19:14.334
<i>after I filmed him
was through letters.</i>

19:14.417 --> 19:16.334
<i>They were not only personal,</i>

19:16.417 --> 19:21.667
but they were very revealing
about his true feelings.

19:23.292 --> 19:27.167
<i>He told me about himself
as a boy</i>

19:27.250 --> 19:30.876
<i>witnessing one of his sisters,
Elveta,</i>

19:30.959 --> 19:34.209
<i>being raped
by two neighbor boys.</i>

19:36.334 --> 19:37.751
Chester:
<i>I was eight years old</i>

19:37.834 --> 19:41.125
<i>when much older boys,
they raped my sister.</i>

19:41.209 --> 19:43.792
<i>They forced me to watch.</i>

19:46.334 --> 19:50.751
<i>The attack was, uh,
in my dad's chicken house.</i>

19:53.500 --> 19:58.209
Yes, I was mistreated

19:58.292 --> 20:00.417
by one of my neighbor boys,

20:00.500 --> 20:03.667
and I could not
explain to my folks

20:03.751 --> 20:07.209
because I did not want Chester

20:07.292 --> 20:11.709
<i>to be blamed
for something, you know?</i>

20:11.792 --> 20:15.792
Chester:
<i>It was my job</i>
<i>to protect my sisters.</i>

20:15.876 --> 20:17.709
<i>What would have happened
when I got older?</i>

20:17.792 --> 20:19.125
I don't know
what I would have done.

20:19.209 --> 20:21.751
But I would try to kill 'em.
I know that.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.250
I wouldn't hesitate.

20:26.709 --> 20:30.292
David:
<i>That started the string</i>
<i>of several letters</i>

20:30.375 --> 20:33.918
<i>that got a little darker,
a little stranger.</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:36.834
<i>"For several years afterwards,</i>

20:36.918 --> 20:40.209
<i>"I had a bad dream
about the 1947 rape.</i>

20:40.292 --> 20:45.876
<i>"In each dream I reheard
my sister's 1947 screams.</i>

20:45.959 --> 20:48.542
"So, I married a girl
who was not a virgin.

20:48.626 --> 20:52.083
"It saved me from having
to sexually hurt her

20:52.167 --> 20:53.834
by taking her virginity."

20:53.918 --> 20:55.500
<i>I'm not a therapist,</i>

20:55.584 --> 20:58.959
<i>but there's, there's definitely
a childhood trauma.</i>

20:59.042 --> 21:03.334
<i>When we were in person,
he was very kind.</i>

21:03.417 --> 21:05.083
I don't hate your father.

21:05.167 --> 21:07.584
And he said,
"You know, David,
he just did his job."

21:07.667 --> 21:09.876
<i>Well, I then got a letter
that said,</i>

21:09.959 --> 21:12.834
<i>"Anthony Raccuglia
told sexual lies about me.</i>

21:12.918 --> 21:15.626
"He claimed I raped
an eight-year-old girl

21:15.709 --> 21:17.584
"when I was 12.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.626
"He also said I performed

21:20.709 --> 21:22.167
"some sort of degenerate,

21:22.250 --> 21:24.209
"perverted sexual act

21:24.292 --> 21:27.584
<i>"that left my wife
permanently maimed.</i>

21:27.667 --> 21:30.709
<i>"But the thing that
your father forgot to report,</i>

21:30.792 --> 21:33.667
<i>"if my murderous,
perverted sex weapon</i>

21:33.751 --> 21:36.375
<i>"was my tongue or my penis,</i>

21:36.459 --> 21:40.542
they were the only two Joann had
ever taken sexually from me."

21:40.626 --> 21:43.292
<i>He knew my dad played
professional baseball,</i>

21:43.375 --> 21:46.459
<i>and so, he asked me
if Mickey Mantle and Nellie Fox</i>

21:46.542 --> 21:49.626
<i>stuck baseball bats
up my dad's ass.</i>

21:49.709 --> 21:53.459
Maybe he was just trying
to make me understand

21:53.542 --> 21:58.000
how it felt to have an attack
on someone's sexuality,

21:58.083 --> 21:59.626
<i>whatever it was.</i>

21:59.709 --> 22:02.584
At the end of that
perverted stuff, he wrote,

22:02.667 --> 22:05.459
"David, have a Merry Christmas,
Chester Weger."

22:07.459 --> 22:11.000
I felt like Chester was
working at trying to get me

22:11.083 --> 22:14.542
to understand him as a person.

22:14.626 --> 22:19.626
<i>But for me, the letters painted
a picture of darkness,</i>

22:19.709 --> 22:23.417
and it completely changed
my perspective on Chester Weger.

22:24.792 --> 22:28.584
<i>Chester Weger was a suspect
right from the beginning</i>

22:28.667 --> 22:31.626
<i>because of that juvenile rape
of an eight-year-old girl</i>

22:31.709 --> 22:33.792
<i>when he was 12 years old.</i>

22:33.876 --> 22:36.250
He denied it.
He said he didn't do it.

22:36.334 --> 22:38.959
Chester:
<i>The girl was raped</i>
<i>and I helped her dress.</i>

22:39.042 --> 22:40.292
<i>I carried her home.</i>

22:40.375 --> 22:43.375
<i>This girl's father,
he made the police release me.</i>

22:43.459 --> 22:44.876
David:
<i>So, I dug deep</i>

22:44.959 --> 22:48.918
<i>into the 12-year-old
Chester Weger rape.</i>

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
<i>I, ultimately, did find
the report,</i>

22:51.083 --> 22:54.250
<i>many, many years after
I interviewed Chester Weger.</i>

22:54.334 --> 22:56.709
<i>It was very detailed.</i>

22:56.792 --> 22:59.876
<i>This young girl,
who was eight years old,</i>

22:59.959 --> 23:02.459
<i>was walking home from school
with Mary Weger,</i>

23:02.542 --> 23:04.542
<i>Chester Weger's sister.</i>

23:04.626 --> 23:09.167
<i>Mary Weger said goodbye to her,
went off on her trail.</i>

23:09.250 --> 23:14.292
<i>Chester Weger grabbed the girl,
raped her.</i>

23:14.375 --> 23:19.918
<i>There was sign
of penetration, blood,</i>

23:20.000 --> 23:24.167
<i>and his parents noticed that he
had blood all over his pants.</i>

23:24.250 --> 23:27.751
<i>And Chester said,
"I killed a snake."</i>

23:27.834 --> 23:32.584
<i>And the police questioned him,
he confessed.</i>

23:32.667 --> 23:38.125
<i>It was a very dark picture
of a sexual troubling.</i>

23:38.209 --> 23:40.375
<i>All of this character analysis</i>

23:40.459 --> 23:43.626
<i>with these priors
was disturbing,</i>

23:43.709 --> 23:47.918
but does that make him
a murderer?

24:00.209 --> 24:02.959
Person:
You can take off your mask now.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.959
Andy:
<i>Poor Chester, I mean,</i>
<i>he gets released from prison</i>

24:06.042 --> 24:07.417
after 60 years,

24:07.500 --> 24:10.792
and the next month,
COVID-19 hits.

24:10.876 --> 24:13.792
<i>Locks him down at his facility.</i>

24:13.876 --> 24:15.709
<i>Family can't come see him,</i>

24:15.792 --> 24:17.876
<i>he can't travel,
can't go anywhere.</i>

24:19.876 --> 24:24.209
When you've been locked up
for 60 years for something
that you didn't do,

24:24.292 --> 24:29.167
and then you finally
get out, and now we have
the pandemic comes.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.584
<i>Once again you're locked up.</i>

24:45.375 --> 24:47.334
(Person on phone speaking)

24:49.125 --> 24:50.334
(Chester speaking)

24:50.417 --> 24:53.334
(Person on phone speaking)

24:55.876 --> 25:00.709
Andy:
<i>The clock's ticking.</i>
<i>Every day matters, every day.</i>

25:00.792 --> 25:03.751
<i>I feel like every
waking moment,</i>

25:03.834 --> 25:06.250
<i>I should be
working on Chester's case.</i>

25:06.334 --> 25:08.959
<i>I always think forensics
is the way to start</i>

25:09.042 --> 25:10.417
<i>if you can do it.</i>

25:10.500 --> 25:12.751
But, at the same time,
I will always ask people,

25:12.834 --> 25:14.459
"Well, what was
word on the street?"

25:14.542 --> 25:17.417
<i>I'm open to anything.</i>

25:17.500 --> 25:18.918
(on phone)
<i>Okay, uh...</i>

25:19.959 --> 25:21.459
Sandra Bland (on phone):
<i>Yes.</i>

25:21.542 --> 25:23.500
Andy:
<i>Do I have your permission</i>
<i>to tape this call?</i>

25:23.584 --> 25:25.042
Sandra:
<i>All right.</i>

25:25.125 --> 25:28.459
Andy:<i> What was it</i>
<i>that Stanley had told you?</i>

25:28.542 --> 25:32.709
Sandra:
<i>That Chester Weger was</i>
<i>not involved in the murder.</i>

25:32.792 --> 25:35.042
<i>It was him and George Spiros.</i>

25:35.125 --> 25:36.709
Andy:
<i>He admitted that to you?</i>

25:36.792 --> 25:38.334
Sandra:
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

25:38.417 --> 25:40.459
Andy:
<i>Wow.</i>

25:40.542 --> 25:42.709
Sandra:
<i>I remember him saying</i>
<i>that the police,</i>

25:42.792 --> 25:44.792
<i>the day they stopped him
in his car,</i>

25:44.876 --> 25:46.500
<i>if they would have searched
the trunk,</i>

25:46.584 --> 25:50.083
<i>they would have found
all the evidence in his trunk.</i>

25:54.042 --> 25:56.000
Andy:
<i>When I heard that,</i>

25:56.083 --> 25:59.083
<i>it sounded too crazy
or good to be true,</i>

25:59.167 --> 26:02.125
but the part that struck me
when I listened to it again

26:02.209 --> 26:04.042
was that it didn't really
seem like

26:04.125 --> 26:06.250
she was trying
to embellish things,

26:06.334 --> 26:08.500
<i>she was telling it
kinda matter of fact.</i>

26:08.584 --> 26:11.959
<i>It sounded credible in terms
of how she told the story.</i>

26:12.042 --> 26:15.584
Sandra (on phone):
<i>He just said it went--</i>
<i>Something went wrong.</i>

26:15.667 --> 26:18.083
Let's go back
to the physical evidence.

26:18.167 --> 26:20.167
<i>The devil's in the details,</i>

26:20.250 --> 26:24.375
<i>and, a lot of times, there's
something insignificant
at first blush</i>

26:24.459 --> 26:27.959
that you later come back to,
and you have, kind of,
an aha moment,

26:28.042 --> 26:31.834
and I had,
kind of, that aha moment
recently in this case.

26:31.918 --> 26:36.167
"No explanation
for end of finger missing,

26:36.250 --> 26:37.834
<i>hole in glove."</i>

26:37.918 --> 26:40.500
<i>Ms. Murphy had</i>

26:40.584 --> 26:45.334
the tip of her left index finger
cut postmortem.

26:45.417 --> 26:48.334
Who does that?

26:48.417 --> 26:50.626
<i>And I think if you look
at how they're laid out,</i>

26:50.709 --> 26:54.375
<i>I mean, it's
a very kinda graphic display.</i>

26:54.459 --> 26:57.292
To me, it's like
a serial killer kinda thing

26:57.375 --> 27:01.292
who wants to collect something
from the crime scene.

27:01.375 --> 27:04.918
That is a very deliberate act,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.709
and that is not Chester Weger.
Give me a break.

27:12.792 --> 27:14.500
(Person speaking)

27:17.292 --> 27:21.167
Well, I think there's somebody
else who was out at the lodge,

27:21.250 --> 27:23.709
and worked there that...

27:25.125 --> 27:27.292
that was involved and, um,

27:27.375 --> 27:30.417
is a more, a much more
logical suspect.

27:31.876 --> 27:37.334
Sandra:
<i>George Spiros.</i>
<i>I know he was involved in that.</i>

27:37.417 --> 27:40.834
<i>Stanley Tucker was like
a instigator.</i>

27:40.918 --> 27:45.167
He would dare George Spiros
to do something,

27:45.250 --> 27:49.709
and George Spiros
didn't have all his marbles,

27:49.792 --> 27:51.667
and he would do it.

27:51.751 --> 27:53.500
<i>It wouldn't surprise me</i>

27:53.584 --> 27:56.417
<i>if Stanley didn't tell
George Spiros,</i>

27:56.500 --> 27:58.918
<i>"Go get those cameras
from them ladies."</i>

27:59.000 --> 28:02.083
<i>And George Spiros
murdered those women.</i>

28:02.167 --> 28:06.918
And I think Stanley
participated in the murder,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.751
so that there was no witnesses.

28:28.459 --> 28:31.083
Karen Norris:
<i>I don't really like</i>
<i>to use the word "psychic,"</i>

28:31.167 --> 28:33.459
because there's a lot
of negative connotation

28:33.542 --> 28:36.375
that comes with those words,
so I use "energy sensitive."

28:36.459 --> 28:39.083
Person:
What did your grandfather
think of your--

28:39.167 --> 28:40.459
He didn't believe in it.

28:40.542 --> 28:42.709
He'd be like, "Oh,
there's nobody here, you know."

28:42.792 --> 28:45.292
"Y-You're crazy,
you're just seeing things."

28:45.375 --> 28:47.584
That's how my grandfather was.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.125
<i>Is Chester Weger responsible</i>

28:52.209 --> 28:55.626
<i>for the murder
of these three women?</i>

28:58.918 --> 29:02.584
I have a male entity
stepping forward saying "no."

29:02.667 --> 29:04.918
I don't know
if that's my grandfather,

29:05.000 --> 29:06.876
but this does not feel
like my grandfather.

29:06.959 --> 29:08.626
Ooh...

29:12.459 --> 29:14.334
A really aggressive...

29:14.417 --> 29:18.584
a really aggressive
male energy, um, ooh...

29:18.667 --> 29:20.626
A really aggressive
male energy telling me

29:20.709 --> 29:23.500
that I don't wanna go down
this path, that I need
to stop where I am

29:23.584 --> 29:26.667
because I'm not going to like
the answers that I get.

29:26.751 --> 29:29.292
Um, I think
this is George Spiros.

29:29.375 --> 29:31.834
I think, I think
this is George Spiros, oh...

29:31.918 --> 29:33.500
I feel really threatened.

29:33.584 --> 29:34.918
Whew!

29:35.000 --> 29:36.959
Um...

29:39.292 --> 29:40.959
He's telling me
to stay out of it.

29:41.042 --> 29:42.375
(exhales sharply)

29:43.918 --> 29:46.459
David:
<i>You know, to say this story</i>

29:46.542 --> 29:48.417
<i>has become more colorful</i>

29:48.500 --> 29:51.083
<i>is a very large understatement.</i>

29:52.751 --> 29:54.918
Dave Marsh:
<i>Well, George</i>
<i>would take the opportunity</i>

29:55.000 --> 30:00.250
<i>to go to the crime scene,
and do whatever
was on his mind,</i>

30:00.334 --> 30:01.792
<i>pretty freaky things.</i>

30:01.876 --> 30:03.751
<i>That would be consistent
with the women...</i>

30:03.834 --> 30:06.334
David:
<i>As a filmmaker, I went in deep.</i>

30:06.417 --> 30:08.834
I found myself at night
on these blogs

30:08.918 --> 30:13.417
reading all of this incredibly
crazy information,

30:13.500 --> 30:15.876
things that I--
were hard to believe,

30:15.959 --> 30:19.542
but, you know,
I tend to be a believer.

30:19.626 --> 30:23.334
<i>But I started to realize
that there was a couple
of people in town</i>

30:23.417 --> 30:25.751
<i>that were not very credible.</i>

30:25.834 --> 30:30.292
Dave:
There's a wound,
there's a wound,

30:30.375 --> 30:32.167
and there's a wound.

30:32.250 --> 30:34.083
<i>This is a torture technique.</i>

30:34.167 --> 30:35.918
<i>When the cut is made,</i>

30:36.042 --> 30:39.334
<i>the, uh, ligaments
in the arm snap back.</i>

30:39.417 --> 30:43.417
The Chinese Triads call it
"death by a thousand cuts."

30:43.500 --> 30:46.417
The person that would,
specifically, know
this technique

30:46.500 --> 30:49.500
would be George Spiros
because he's been trained

30:49.584 --> 30:53.459
for the CIA and other
clandestine operations.

30:54.751 --> 30:56.250
If you look back in history,

30:56.334 --> 30:59.375
an operation that was
going on around the world,

30:59.459 --> 31:01.375
uh, was called Operation Gladio,

31:01.459 --> 31:05.375
which was, basically,
just mayhem and terrorism
everywhere.

31:05.459 --> 31:07.876
The first Operation Gladio event

31:07.959 --> 31:10.042
was probably
the Starved Rock murders.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.542
Excuse me.

31:11.626 --> 31:15.667
If you study the history
of these pedophile rings,

31:15.751 --> 31:18.375
you always find judges,
governors.

31:18.459 --> 31:22.584
"I'm gonna go have a sex orgy at
the Starved Rock Lodge, honey.
Y-Ya got a problem with that?"

31:24.709 --> 31:27.334
<i>Nobody wants to talk about it,
there's a fear.</i>

31:27.417 --> 31:29.751
<i>You gotta be careful
what you say.</i>

31:29.834 --> 31:33.125
And I don't really know
anything about the senator,

31:33.209 --> 31:36.792
but, uh, give me some liquor
and I'll speculate.

31:36.876 --> 31:38.709
(laughs)

31:40.334 --> 31:42.042
David:
<i>David Marsh is</i>

31:42.125 --> 31:44.542
<i>unapologetically inappropriate.</i>

31:44.626 --> 31:47.751
I mean, the things that he
comes up with, the theories,

31:47.834 --> 31:49.626
<i>and they don't help the case.</i>

31:49.709 --> 31:51.918
Dan Churney:
<i>There's this hardcore group</i>
<i>of people who believe Weger</i>

31:52.000 --> 31:56.250
is framed, and they're just,
you know, one-track mind.

31:56.334 --> 31:59.459
It's hard to have a conversation
with them about it.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.000
Steve Stout:
<i>I know David Marsh, yes.</i>

32:02.083 --> 32:05.375
We've had some... discussions.

32:05.459 --> 32:07.500
He enrages me.

32:07.584 --> 32:10.667
I'd rather not be talking
about him, personally.

32:10.751 --> 32:13.751
I mean, he's,
I think, dangerous.

32:13.834 --> 32:15.584
Dave (on phone):
<i>This is David Marsh.</i>

32:15.667 --> 32:18.209
<i>You hung up on me
'cause I yelled at you.</i>

32:18.292 --> 32:21.876
<i>You are the biggest pussy
I've ever talked to in my life</i>

32:21.959 --> 32:24.292
<i>if you thought
that was yelling.</i>

32:24.375 --> 32:26.292
Th-That's just his nature.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.167
<i>And he came in several times
to the newspaper,</i>

32:29.250 --> 32:31.250
<i>and the authorities
were called in.</i>

32:31.334 --> 32:33.584
David:
<i>The Free Chester Weger group</i>

32:33.667 --> 32:36.542
went from being,
sort of, rumors and innuendo

32:36.626 --> 32:38.626
to lunatic fringe.

32:38.709 --> 32:42.000
Mary:
<i>Everybody that sticks</i>
<i>their nose in this</i>

32:42.083 --> 32:43.959
that don't know him--

32:44.042 --> 32:47.375
I have nothing to do
with Free Chester Weger.

32:47.459 --> 32:48.542
As a matter of fact,

32:48.626 --> 32:50.334
<i>we call them
"The Three Stooges."</i>

32:50.417 --> 32:54.083
<i>I try to say,
"Stay out of it.
Leave him alone."</i>

32:54.167 --> 32:56.876
It-- All it does is
it hurts the case.

32:56.959 --> 32:59.167
It does-- It hurts my brother.

33:00.292 --> 33:01.584
(cat meows)

33:01.667 --> 33:05.375
Deedra Fox:
<i>We started out</i>
<i>with the best intentions.</i>

33:05.459 --> 33:08.459
<i>We were led down a dark road.</i>

33:08.542 --> 33:11.334
Dave Marsh destroyed me.

33:11.417 --> 33:13.334
He destroyed Bob Petre.

33:13.417 --> 33:16.667
<i>And we were led to believe,
the end of our movie,</i>

33:16.751 --> 33:19.751
we're gonna film Chester
coming through the gates,

33:19.834 --> 33:24.375
and him grabbing
your guys' hands and crying.

33:26.042 --> 33:29.250
And I wish that's
the way it had happened.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.459
But it didn't.

33:33.584 --> 33:35.167
(peaceful guitar playing)

33:35.250 --> 33:38.667
Person:
<i>We have one more topic here,</i>
<i>the documentary.</i>

33:38.751 --> 33:41.209
<i>David Raccuglia,
I believe, whose father,</i>

33:41.292 --> 33:42.834
<i>Tony Raccuglia, coincidentally,</i>

33:42.918 --> 33:44.709
<i>I'm sure they had
some fun Thanksgiving dinners.</i>

33:44.792 --> 33:47.334
<i>I mean, we're going back
almost 60 years now.</i>

33:47.417 --> 33:48.417
<i>How do you begin...?</i>

33:48.500 --> 33:50.042
Anthony:
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

33:50.125 --> 33:52.292
<i>What motivation do you have?</i>

33:52.375 --> 33:55.709
<i>I wonder about what this
is gonna really do for you.</i>

33:55.792 --> 33:57.959
<i>Through grade school,
through high school,</i>

33:58.042 --> 34:00.542
<i>didn't I tell you the same
things I'm telling you now?</i>

34:00.626 --> 34:04.042
<i>There just isn't any doubt
that the man was guilty.</i>

34:04.125 --> 34:08.459
David:
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>the confidence my father had</i>

34:08.542 --> 34:10.250
<i>that Chester Weger was guilty.</i>

34:10.334 --> 34:15.083
I also don't believe
he's a hundred percent innocent.

34:15.167 --> 34:18.626
(on computer)
<i>So, let's start</i>
<i>with the beating.</i>

34:18.709 --> 34:23.959
<i>I went back to the interview
that I did with Chester Weger.</i>

34:24.042 --> 34:25.292
Sher-Sheriff Eutsey

34:25.375 --> 34:29.292
<i>started out by jabbing me
in the stomach</i>

34:29.375 --> 34:30.626
with a, a nightstick.

34:30.709 --> 34:33.417
David:
<i>The first time</i>
<i>I interviewed Chester,</i>

34:33.500 --> 34:34.751
<i>I was infuriated, you know?</i>

34:34.834 --> 34:36.584
It sounded like the confession

34:36.667 --> 34:40.042
was completely
coerced out of him.
I got a little angry.

34:40.125 --> 34:43.876
If others hadn't been there,
I, I think he, actually,
would have killed me

34:43.959 --> 34:45.792
'cause Eutsey, Eutsey went nuts.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.834
Chester was not
physically abused at all.

34:48.918 --> 34:51.375
And you have to remember
he had the opportunity

34:51.459 --> 34:53.876
to challenge the confessions
at a separate hearing.

34:53.959 --> 34:57.751
If he was going to claim someone
beat the confession out of him,

34:57.834 --> 35:00.626
<i>that's when it should
have been made, and it wasn't.</i>

35:00.709 --> 35:02.167
<i>He never at any time</i>

35:02.250 --> 35:06.000
<i>said anybody beat
the statement out of him</i>

35:06.083 --> 35:08.375
<i>in order to get him
to admit to the killing.</i>

35:08.459 --> 35:11.000
I thought, yeah, you know,
that's, that's interesting.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.792
I got all the transcripts,

35:12.876 --> 35:15.584
<i>everything I could get
on the trial,
and I started reading.</i>

35:15.667 --> 35:20.626
<i>There's not one mention
of beatings
and physical abuse in 1960.</i>

35:20.709 --> 35:25.042
<i>To deem that confession
admissible,
they had a long hearing.</i>

35:25.125 --> 35:28.375
Anthony:
<i>We put on about</i>
<i>a dozen witnesses to testify</i>

35:28.459 --> 35:31.459
to show the confession
was a voluntary statement.

35:31.542 --> 35:34.459
David:
<i>And Herschel Weger</i>
<i>said to all of that,</i>

35:34.542 --> 35:37.209
<i>"My son seemed like
he was fine."</i>

35:37.292 --> 35:39.667
<i>And Chester was asked
the same questions.</i>

35:39.751 --> 35:41.334
<i>"I was not beaten."</i>

35:41.417 --> 35:45.250
<i>I was given cigarettes
and sandwiches.
I was treated well."</i>

35:45.334 --> 35:49.167
<i>I saw no intimidation
or anything.</i>

35:50.000 --> 35:52.167
<i>He seemed very willing,</i>

35:52.250 --> 35:55.626
very friendly with them,
I would say.

35:55.709 --> 35:59.125
Especially with Dummett,
he seemed to be very friendly.

35:59.209 --> 36:01.000
David:
<i>It wasn't just</i>
<i>Dummett and Hess,</i>

36:01.083 --> 36:04.000
court reporters, psychologists.

36:04.083 --> 36:07.959
His confession of this crime
was given to many.

36:08.042 --> 36:11.250
<i>There was a photo of Chester
with his shirt off.</i>

36:11.334 --> 36:13.250
<i>There was a doctor's report,
and it said</i>

36:13.334 --> 36:17.083
<i>Chester was not beaten
the night of the confession.</i>

36:17.167 --> 36:19.042
<i>Chester's own words,</i>

36:19.125 --> 36:21.083
his side of the story,

36:21.167 --> 36:24.459
is completely different
than public record.

36:24.542 --> 36:27.500
<i>These other people,
it's really hard to believe</i>

36:27.584 --> 36:30.918
<i>that they would be part of
a conspiracy to frame Chester.</i>

36:31.000 --> 36:35.542
<i>The conspiracy
has to keep getting bigger
and bigger and bigger.</i>

36:35.626 --> 36:39.500
<i>Sheriff Eutsey bragged
about what he done to me,
everybody knew about it.</i>

36:39.584 --> 36:43.000
I told McNamara, and he told me

36:43.083 --> 36:45.626
<i>that the police were gonna deny
that they done it, that--</i>

36:45.709 --> 36:47.918
and I just went
by what McNamara told me.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.042
McNamara told me
to forget about it.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.751
Impossible.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.626
McNamara was very adamant

36:53.709 --> 36:56.334
<i>at the corruptness
of the law enforcement</i>

36:56.417 --> 36:57.417
<i>on this case.</i>

36:57.500 --> 36:59.042
<i>Very adamant.</i>

36:59.125 --> 37:01.292
He would have had that
tattooed on his arm

37:01.375 --> 37:02.500
that Chester was beaten.

37:02.584 --> 37:06.959
<i>To keep that fact out
makes no sense.</i>

37:07.042 --> 37:09.042
I don't believe he was beaten.

37:09.125 --> 37:11.876
Andy:
<i>He says he was beaten.</i>

37:11.959 --> 37:13.250
I believe that.

37:13.334 --> 37:15.250
<i>But whether there
was or wasn't,</i>

37:15.334 --> 37:17.042
<i>I think the threats of death,</i>

37:17.125 --> 37:20.459
and all the coercive techniques
that have gone on
since September,

37:20.542 --> 37:23.167
<i>their game plan worked.</i>

37:23.250 --> 37:26.000
Chester, I believe,

37:26.083 --> 37:30.500
added color to the story
after years in prison.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.626
<i>So, we're entering Oglesby.</i>

37:40.709 --> 37:43.125
This is where Chester Weger's
family home was.

37:43.209 --> 37:46.751
<i>According to
the clemency petition,
on the day of the murder,</i>

37:46.834 --> 37:49.000
<i>Chester would have visited
Franklin's Barber Shop,</i>

37:49.083 --> 37:50.542
<i>which is right here.</i>

37:50.626 --> 37:52.459
Chester:
<i>The time this crime happened,</i>

37:52.542 --> 37:54.709
Stanley Tucker
had taken me to Oglesby,

37:54.792 --> 37:57.792
and I got a haircut
at Ben Franklin's Barber Shop.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.167
I told the police
when they first questioned me.

38:00.250 --> 38:03.959
David:
<i>That's the new alibi</i>
<i>that came out in 2003.</i>

38:04.042 --> 38:08.000
<i>Chester claims he told that
to law enforcement</i>

38:08.083 --> 38:09.292
<i>right from the beginning,</i>

38:09.375 --> 38:11.500
<i>so I started digging
for more documents,</i>

38:11.584 --> 38:14.959
<i>and I came across
the original police file.</i>

38:15.042 --> 38:18.792
This was the first time
the police ever interviewed him.

38:18.876 --> 38:23.209
<i>"I finished work
about 2:45 or 3 PM,</i>

38:23.292 --> 38:28.417
<i>and went down to the basement,
and wrote a letter to a girl."</i>

38:29.918 --> 38:32.459
<i>The jury heard one alibi
in 1960,</i>

38:32.542 --> 38:34.459
and it was the same one
he told the police.

38:34.542 --> 38:37.459
<i>There's no mention
of Stanley Tucker.</i>

38:37.542 --> 38:40.250
He never mentioned
anything about haircuts,

38:40.334 --> 38:41.876
and things like that.

38:41.959 --> 38:45.000
I believe Chester might have
not been telling me the truth.

38:45.083 --> 38:49.500
<i>Donna Kelly was very adamant
he was getting a haircut.</i>

38:49.584 --> 38:53.792
<i>She had a man who was quite
elderly sign an affidavit.</i>

38:58.500 --> 39:02.167
I, I don't know, I don't know
why he never come in, you know?

39:02.250 --> 39:05.334
I was told he had died,
and, and, and, uh,

39:05.417 --> 39:07.250
I-- my father
thought he had died, too.

39:07.334 --> 39:09.667
Brian:
<i>Chester Weger</i>
<i>had many, many years</i>

39:09.751 --> 39:11.250
to try to think of,

39:11.334 --> 39:14.584
uh, "Okay, well, maybe this
was this or that was that."

39:14.667 --> 39:17.751
"Oh, check with so-and-so
because I was there."

39:17.834 --> 39:19.626
An alternate reality

39:19.709 --> 39:23.959
<i>can suddenly become reality
in some people's minds.</i>

39:24.042 --> 39:26.042
(Chester speaking)

39:31.125 --> 39:33.209
It's an interesting ride
when you interview him

39:33.292 --> 39:35.334
because he changes the story.

39:35.417 --> 39:36.709
(Chester speaking on phone)

39:48.000 --> 39:50.375
I don't even wanna say lies,
but the truth is,

39:50.459 --> 39:52.125
they're looking like lies
at this point.

39:52.209 --> 39:55.167
<i>Every shoot,
Chester had a whole new story.</i>

40:00.209 --> 40:02.042
David:
<i>He told me this whole story</i>

40:02.125 --> 40:05.959
that is nowhere
to be found in 1960.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.542
DJ:
<i>I'm still a little</i>
<i>uncomfortable about it,</i>

40:12.626 --> 40:14.584
<i>but there it is
on the front page.</i>

40:14.667 --> 40:17.667
<i>You know, the Facebook
meatheads are like,
"Oh, he didn't do it.</i>

40:17.751 --> 40:19.250
<i>He didn't do it.
He's innocent."</i>

40:19.334 --> 40:22.667
<i>The same Facebook meatheads
are now like...</i>

40:22.751 --> 40:26.500
(slaps desk)
<i>"I can't believe</i>
<i>he's living next door!"</i>

40:26.584 --> 40:28.876
(laughs)
<i>815-223-30--</i>

40:28.959 --> 40:30.959
Nita:
<i>So, he's finally home,</i>

40:31.042 --> 40:32.167
<i>and we weren't even</i>

40:32.250 --> 40:33.834
<i>at the new house
for 15 minutes,</i>

40:33.918 --> 40:36.500
<i>and</i> The News Tribune
<i>knocked on our front door,</i>

40:36.584 --> 40:40.876
and he said,
"LaSalle County needs
to know that he's here."

40:40.959 --> 40:45.459
<i>That's when the fiasco
started with the city
and the police department.</i>

40:45.542 --> 40:47.125
<i>-They were harassing him.</i>
-Carrie:<i> Yeah.</i>

40:47.209 --> 40:49.459
The harassment's
gonna continue,
and has continued,

40:49.542 --> 40:53.459
and no matter where
he moves, it's gonna,
it's gonna continue.

40:53.542 --> 40:55.417
-Carrie:<i> Yeah.</i>
-Nita:<i> And now,</i>
<i>they're adding</i>

40:55.500 --> 40:58.125
<i>the sexual offender registry
on him now, too.</i>

40:58.209 --> 41:00.876
<i>Johnny is labeled
as a sex offender as well,</i>

41:01.000 --> 41:03.292
<i>so they are not allowed
to see each other.</i>

41:03.375 --> 41:05.626
And, and Johnny's crushed
just like he is.

41:06.876 --> 41:08.417
(Chester speaking)

41:12.375 --> 41:14.918
Nita:
<i>We always ask him,</i>
<i>"What do you want us to do?"</i>

41:15.000 --> 41:16.125
He wants to be cleared.

41:16.209 --> 41:18.500
That's-- We're gonna
continue to fight until

41:18.584 --> 41:20.209
he is vindicated.

41:21.292 --> 41:22.876
And we know
it's gonna happen.

41:22.959 --> 41:25.542
-Yep.
-We just don't know when.

41:25.626 --> 41:27.209
Photographer:
Let me just take
a few more shots.

41:27.292 --> 41:30.000
(camera shutter clicking)

41:30.083 --> 41:31.834
David:
<i>The span of time,</i>

41:31.918 --> 41:35.500
<i>to me, that's the biggest
hurdle we're gonna have to jump</i>

41:35.584 --> 41:37.417
<i>in order to get to the truth.</i>

41:37.500 --> 41:39.417
There's not
a lot of people left.

41:39.500 --> 41:44.292
<i>My father, Harland Warren,
these people are gone.</i>

41:44.375 --> 41:48.042
<i>I thought the only one left
in this case would have been
Chester Weger</i>

41:48.125 --> 41:50.751
<i>after my father passed away.</i>

41:50.834 --> 41:52.542
It wasn't true.

41:54.626 --> 41:56.709
<i>This was my father's
first case.</i>

41:56.792 --> 41:58.709
He was 26 years old.

41:58.792 --> 42:01.918
You were both very young
and very early in your careers,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.167
and you both had
such an impact on this case.

42:05.250 --> 42:06.334
<i>That's pretty rare.</i>

42:06.417 --> 42:07.792
Bill Jansen:
<i>You learn by experience.</i>

42:07.876 --> 42:10.834
You ran into a lot
of different characters

42:10.918 --> 42:12.542
that could have done it,
you know?

42:12.626 --> 42:15.292
That's all part of,
of a criminal investigation,

42:15.375 --> 42:19.375
but I thought to myself,
this case has to be solved.

42:19.459 --> 42:20.918
It has to be solved.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.542
David:
<i>Back in 1960,</i>

42:22.626 --> 42:25.083
<i>Bill Jansen was handpicked</i>

42:25.167 --> 42:26.918
<i>to give fresh eyes to the case.</i>

42:27.000 --> 42:28.292
<i>I mean, this is a man who,</i>

42:28.375 --> 42:30.584
<i>later in life,
went into the FBI,</i>

42:30.667 --> 42:31.959
<i>became a judge.</i>

42:32.042 --> 42:35.542
<i>He made a lot of sense,
and what he said, for me,</i>

42:35.626 --> 42:38.542
changed everything
about the case.

42:42.709 --> 42:46.167
Bill:
<i>The superintendent of</i>
<i>the Illinois State Police said,</i>

42:46.250 --> 42:50.000
<i>"I'm assigning you to
the Starved Rock murders case</i>

42:50.083 --> 42:51.918
<i>because there
was a standstill."</i>

42:52.000 --> 42:55.083
Few suspects, but really
nothing definite going on.

42:55.167 --> 42:58.292
Complicated case,
very complicated.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.375
It was from the beginning.

43:00.459 --> 43:04.417
<i>Now the details
set out in the confession,
it just didn't make sense.</i>

43:04.500 --> 43:08.834
<i>The women were found
at St. Louis Canyon.</i>

43:08.918 --> 43:12.959
<i>There's quite a distance from
the lodge to the crime scene.</i>

43:13.042 --> 43:15.500
<i>That trail was treacherous.</i>

43:15.584 --> 43:19.167
<i>Ms. Oetting had a bad back,
a slipped disk.</i>

43:19.250 --> 43:23.876
<i>Now to walk that with
a bad back and a slipped disk,
it's almost impossible.</i>

43:23.959 --> 43:27.792
I walked it several times during
good weather and it is tough.

43:29.459 --> 43:31.959
<i>But going in the West entrance,
it's flat,</i>

43:32.042 --> 43:33.834
<i>just walked right in.</i>

43:33.918 --> 43:37.000
<i>I believe someone
gave 'em a ride</i>

43:37.083 --> 43:40.876
<i>to the West entrance
of the canyon.</i>

43:40.959 --> 43:43.125
<i>George Spiros
saw the three women</i>

43:43.209 --> 43:46.542
<i>in front of the--
what they call
the root beer stand,</i>

43:46.626 --> 43:48.417
<i>saw them walk past.</i>

43:48.500 --> 43:50.751
<i>Timewise, there's quite
a distance</i>

43:50.834 --> 43:53.417
<i>from the lodge
to that root beer stand,</i>

43:53.500 --> 43:56.792
<i>and then, to go
all the way back...</i>

43:56.876 --> 44:00.500
<i>and then, down
through the trail...</i>

44:00.584 --> 44:02.125
<i>I, I just don't believe it.</i>

44:02.209 --> 44:05.292
I, I, still to this day,
believe that they
were given a ride

44:05.375 --> 44:08.918
to the West entrance
of St. Louis Canyon.

44:11.709 --> 44:14.000
<i>A little later,
another witness</i>

44:14.083 --> 44:17.250
saw a black car
in the parking lot

44:17.334 --> 44:20.000
<i>at, at St. Louis Canyon,
the West entrance.</i>

44:20.083 --> 44:21.751
Person:
<i>Can you read</i>
<i>that witness statement?</i>

44:21.834 --> 44:24.834
Bill:
<i>Yeah. "One man,</i>
<i>leather fringe jacket,</i>

44:24.918 --> 44:27.500
<i>"the two men standing
behind the trunk,</i>

44:27.584 --> 44:32.209
<i>and he was pouring water
on the other man's hand."</i>

44:32.292 --> 44:35.500
<i>Stanley Tucker has
a black Cadillac.</i>

44:35.584 --> 44:37.334
I'm strongly convinced

44:37.417 --> 44:40.125
that Stanley Tucker
gave 'em a ride

44:40.209 --> 44:43.000
<i>to the West entrance
of the canyon.</i>

44:43.083 --> 44:45.709
<i>That put 'em together.</i>

44:45.792 --> 44:48.751
<i>That's why Chester Weger
and Stanley Tucker</i>

44:48.834 --> 44:52.542
<i>were the two main suspects
in this case.</i>

44:53.500 --> 44:54.834
(Person speaking)

44:54.918 --> 44:56.083
No, no.

44:56.167 --> 44:58.209
<i>But that was
up to Harland Warren.</i>

44:58.292 --> 45:01.209
<i>They didn't have enough,
I guess, to prosecute him on.</i>

45:01.292 --> 45:03.876
Uh... and I, still to this day,

45:03.959 --> 45:06.334
I said, I, I don't see how
he did it by himself,

45:06.417 --> 45:08.042
but he said he did.

45:09.125 --> 45:11.876
<i>Was he by himself?</i>

45:12.000 --> 45:13.959
<i>Stanley Tucker,</i>

45:14.042 --> 45:17.167
<i>whether he went
into the canyon with Chester,</i>

45:17.250 --> 45:19.500
<i>only Chester can answer that.</i>

45:25.250 --> 45:26.709
(Person speaking)

45:27.626 --> 45:29.959
He was a good guy.

45:30.042 --> 45:32.584
Stanley, Stanley wouldn't
bother nobody.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.167
Person:
One of the things, Chester,
that I wanted to ask you about,

45:39.250 --> 45:42.459
you wrote this letter
to your father.

45:42.542 --> 45:44.125
This.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.209
What year is this?
Do you know?

45:47.292 --> 45:49.500
Person:
This is December 13th.
It's 1960.

45:49.584 --> 45:55.751
So this, David, actually,
found in a stack of papers.

45:58.626 --> 46:00.417
David:
<i>This letter...</i>

46:00.500 --> 46:02.083
<i>this letter, you know,</i>

46:02.167 --> 46:06.751
<i>incredibly cryptic
and hard to understand.</i>

46:06.834 --> 46:09.000
<i>Chester wrote this
to his father</i>

46:09.083 --> 46:12.375
<i>while he was awaiting trial
at county jail.</i>

46:14.334 --> 46:17.918
<i>"Dear Dad, I don't know
how to say this,</i>

46:18.000 --> 46:21.584
<i>"but I have to, and I don't
want you saying anything.</i>

46:21.667 --> 46:26.834
<i>"If you do, I'll see myself
that I get the electric chair.</i>

46:28.792 --> 46:32.792
<i>"Any ideas you have
that if I never told the truth,</i>

46:32.876 --> 46:35.584
<i>"you were going
to tell the truth yourself</i>

46:35.667 --> 46:38.167
<i>"who killed these people.</i>

46:38.250 --> 46:39.959
<i>"Only I could tell you,</i>

46:40.042 --> 46:44.375
"and despite of what I never
will tell you the real truth.

46:44.459 --> 46:47.792
"Your life, Mom's life,

46:47.876 --> 46:49.417
<i>"Joann's life,</i>

46:49.500 --> 46:54.334
<i>and the kids'
mean more to me than my own."</i>

46:54.417 --> 46:56.334
<i>I think what he's trying
to say is,</i>

46:56.417 --> 47:00.918
"I'm not the murderer,
but I'm harboring information."

47:01.000 --> 47:04.792
"I've only got
two choices, Dad:
to fight it in court,

47:04.876 --> 47:08.709
"and either burn or see
bloody harm come to you,

47:08.792 --> 47:12.751
"or to stick with the story
and to give life to all.

47:12.834 --> 47:17.459
"But I want you to know
I'm not the one.

47:17.542 --> 47:20.959
"Tell no one this
and I promise you this,

47:21.042 --> 47:22.751
"if you do at any time,

47:22.834 --> 47:24.959
"I'll burn because
I won't see you hurt

47:25.042 --> 47:29.083
for something I can't
and I won't ever tell you."

47:29.167 --> 47:30.959
(Mary speaking)

47:38.417 --> 47:39.876
David:
<i>"I'm young.</i>

47:39.959 --> 47:43.459
<i>"I have read the Bible,
and I believe in the Lord,</i>

47:43.542 --> 47:45.918
<i>"and I'm not afraid.</i>

47:46.000 --> 47:49.042
<i>"So, forgive me.</i>

47:49.125 --> 47:51.167
<i>Your son, Chester."</i>

47:54.709 --> 47:58.250
Andy:
<i>"Your son, Chester O. Weger."</i>

48:09.209 --> 48:12.334
Were you ever protecting
anybody else that, actually,
did the murders?

48:12.417 --> 48:14.417
-No, no.
-Okay.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.667
Protecting somebody else
who may have killed somebody--

48:18.083 --> 48:19.542
and you didn't want
to tattle on them?

48:27.959 --> 48:30.292
Andy:
Can we, maybe, take a break?

48:34.334 --> 48:40.209
David:
<i>That letter made me feel</i>
<i>Chester is hiding something.</i>

48:42.375 --> 48:45.709
If it wasn't him, it was someone
else that he had knowledge

48:45.792 --> 48:49.417
<i>because then he came back
and said, "I am not the one."</i>

48:49.500 --> 48:51.667
"The one."

48:55.500 --> 48:58.626
<i>When I was
making the documentary,</i>

48:58.709 --> 49:01.000
<i>the Spiros name kept coming up.</i>

49:01.083 --> 49:04.959
<i>Bill Jansen took
the heat off Spiros,</i>

49:05.042 --> 49:07.584
and started to shine
the light a little bit more
on Stanley Tucker.

49:07.667 --> 49:10.292
<i>I told the police, I said,
"You arrest Stanley Tucker."</i>

49:10.375 --> 49:12.834
<i>I said, "I'm gonna,
I'm gonna testify for him</i>

49:12.918 --> 49:15.250
<i>because I know
the man's innocent.
He was with me."</i>

49:15.334 --> 49:19.918
David:
<i>It's possible that Chester</i>
<i>sticks up for Stanley,</i>

49:20.000 --> 49:22.209
uses Stanley in his alibi

49:22.292 --> 49:25.500
because Chester and Stanley
were together

49:25.584 --> 49:26.959
on the day of the murder.

49:28.125 --> 49:31.584
I, I can't remember
too much about it.

49:31.667 --> 49:33.751
It's been so long ago.

49:35.626 --> 49:39.959
David:
<i>Time has warped the perception,</i>

49:40.042 --> 49:43.667
and I'm not sure
Chester Weger's capable

49:43.751 --> 49:46.667
of answering
the questions anymore.

49:50.751 --> 49:54.334
<i>Andy, I spent a lot of time
interviewing Chester.</i>

49:54.417 --> 49:56.751
Things like his alibi.

49:56.834 --> 49:59.542
That was a very
inconsistent story.

49:59.626 --> 50:03.876
I can't tell you whether
he's telling the truth
when he says he was beaten,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.209
uh, when he says
his alibi was X, Y, and Z.

50:07.292 --> 50:09.500
Uh, those things
may or may not be true.

50:09.584 --> 50:12.667
But there's all the elements
of a false confession.

50:12.751 --> 50:14.792
The crime scene
is not compatible

50:14.876 --> 50:16.959
-with his story
and the confession.
-Right.

50:17.042 --> 50:19.000
That's why I'm sitting
here today.

50:19.083 --> 50:22.959
I think he is not
a reliable storyteller

50:23.042 --> 50:25.125
40, 50, 60 years later.

50:25.209 --> 50:29.292
The damage to a person
after four decades in prison

50:29.375 --> 50:32.542
can be substantial,
especially if you're innocent.

50:32.626 --> 50:36.375
That's why I've looked at,
kind of, the evidence
as opposed to,

50:36.459 --> 50:40.834
you know, whether
he said something that,
that did or didn't make sense.

50:42.459 --> 50:45.417
David:
<i>The ironic thing</i>
<i>about this case</i>

50:45.500 --> 50:47.250
<i>is we've uncovered</i>

50:47.334 --> 50:50.417
<i>an incredible amount
of information,</i>

50:50.500 --> 50:53.709
but I-I-I'm not sure
I can do any more.

50:53.792 --> 50:57.042
<i>It's, kind of, up to Andy Hale
to take it from here.</i>

50:57.125 --> 51:00.042
Andy:
If your dad was here right now,
if I were to say to him,

51:00.125 --> 51:03.667
"Would you be interested
in DNA testing?"
What do you think he would say?

51:03.751 --> 51:06.959
I'm positive
he would be interested
in DNA testing.

51:07.042 --> 51:10.751
<i>That is the only way
conclusion is going to come,</i>

51:10.834 --> 51:15.584
through a DNA match
of either Chester Weger
or another individual.

51:21.834 --> 51:23.918
Andy:
<i>Let's be real,</i>
<i>today is our biggest day.</i>

51:24.000 --> 51:27.667
-We're not asking the court
to declare Chester innocent.
-Right.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.459
We're simply asking,

51:29.542 --> 51:32.959
let us have access
to the physical evidence,

51:33.042 --> 51:36.334
so Microtrace can do analysis.

51:36.417 --> 51:38.500
Carrie:
You know,
we wanna clear his name

51:38.584 --> 51:41.792
before he does pass.
That is my, my biggest fear,

51:41.876 --> 51:44.000
is not being able to do that
for him before he passes--

51:44.083 --> 51:46.834
-Mary: And I think
he'll keep fighting, he will.
-'cause he wants it so bad.

51:46.918 --> 51:49.626
-He wants it so bad.
-Mary: 'Cause that's what
he said all these years.

51:49.709 --> 51:51.834
"I'll fight it 'til
the day I die."

51:51.918 --> 51:54.584
-And I think that's
what has kept him going.
-It's kept him going.

51:54.667 --> 51:57.167
-It really has.
-Mary: Because that's exactly
what he's done.

51:58.709 --> 52:00.626
God is with us.

52:00.709 --> 52:02.125
All the way through.

52:02.209 --> 52:05.292
Andy:
<i>Absolutely, absolutely.</i>

52:07.542 --> 52:10.000
Steve:
<i>Is that why we're here,</i>
<i>looking for justice?</i>

52:10.083 --> 52:12.542
Is it a search for justice,

52:12.626 --> 52:15.751
or is it a search
for a settlement?

52:18.959 --> 52:22.584
Mary:
<i>Everybody thinks</i>
<i>that we're in it for the money.</i>

52:22.667 --> 52:25.375
We're not in it for the money.
I'm not in it for the money.

52:25.459 --> 52:29.584
I want the world,
because this is worldwide,

52:29.667 --> 52:34.083
and I want those people to know
that my brother did not do this.

52:37.918 --> 52:39.959
(Judge speaking)

53:11.709 --> 53:12.751
Andy:
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

53:12.834 --> 53:14.751
-Yeah.
-Mary: Finally, finally.

53:14.834 --> 53:16.375
Oh my gosh.

53:16.459 --> 53:20.042
<i>The judge started talking
about the history of the case.</i>

53:20.125 --> 53:22.209
It sounded like
we were gonna lose again.

53:22.292 --> 53:24.042
But then, when he said,
"You know what?

53:24.125 --> 53:26.375
This isn't fair.
It's not fair."

53:26.459 --> 53:28.334
Can you hear me, young man?

53:28.417 --> 53:29.375
Chester (on phone):
<i>Yes.</i>

53:29.459 --> 53:32.167
So, we took a huge
step forward today.

53:32.250 --> 53:33.626
We'll be able to test
this evidence,

53:33.709 --> 53:35.292
and prove your innocence.
How about that?

53:35.375 --> 53:38.167
We just had to call,
and tell you the good news.

53:38.250 --> 53:39.334
I love you, brother.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.125
All:
Love you, Chester!

53:41.209 --> 53:42.751
(Mary laughs)

53:52.667 --> 53:55.834
Steve:
<i>I'm here to protect the story.</i>

53:55.918 --> 53:58.334
<i>That's the only reason
I'm sitting here.</i>

53:59.626 --> 54:01.626
<i>I stand for the prosecution.</i>

54:02.792 --> 54:04.167
<i>I stand for the truth.</i>

54:04.250 --> 54:06.459
And I know that sounds
pretty noble,

54:06.542 --> 54:08.959
but that's just
what, what I am right now.

54:09.042 --> 54:12.876
And I'll protect this story
until my last breath.

54:15.542 --> 54:17.834
David:
<i>When it comes to true crime,</i>

54:17.918 --> 54:22.125
<i>everyone wants to be
part of solving something.</i>

54:22.209 --> 54:23.667
<i>Decade after decade,</i>

54:23.751 --> 54:25.959
<i>generation after generation,</i>

54:26.042 --> 54:28.584
<i>it snowballed out of control.</i>

54:30.459 --> 54:32.083
(cat meows)

54:32.167 --> 54:35.292
Mary:
<i>I put all these memories away.</i>

54:35.375 --> 54:38.167
<i>Everything just comes
flooding back.</i>

54:38.250 --> 54:42.626
<i>Early this morning,
I, I dreamt about my mom.</i>

54:42.709 --> 54:45.125
She don't have
to go through it no more.

54:48.375 --> 54:51.792
David:
<i>Let's face it, this is</i>
<i>a collateral damage story.</i>

54:51.876 --> 54:55.500
<i>I feel for the families.</i>

54:55.584 --> 54:59.375
<i>They're gonna have
to hear this story again...</i>

55:01.250 --> 55:06.083
<i>be emotionally brought back
to all of this trauma.</i>

55:07.792 --> 55:11.000
<i>I wish my father was alive
to talk to him about this.</i>

55:11.083 --> 55:15.375
<i>You know,
I know deep down he supported</i>
<i>what we were doing</i> .

55:15.459 --> 55:18.751
<i>We're getting everything
out on the table.</i>

55:18.834 --> 55:20.459
<i>What is fact?</i>

55:20.542 --> 55:22.334
<i>What is fiction?</i>

55:22.417 --> 55:27.042
<i>That somebody really looked
into this case.</i>
