00:44.916 --> 00:48.041
Echo and I have scoured through
Imperial and Republic files,

00:48.041 --> 00:51.416
but intel about
the Advanced Science Division is limited.

00:51.416 --> 00:54.458
Do we know where they're detaining
Crosshair and the other clones?

00:54.458 --> 00:57.500
Negative.
Their base of operations is unknown.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.666
Well, what about their chief scientist?

00:59.666 --> 01:03.416
There is even less on Dr. Hemlock,
and I was very thorough.

01:03.416 --> 01:05.583
He is a ghost.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.166
Not quite.

01:07.166 --> 01:09.291
According to a contact of mine,

01:09.291 --> 01:13.875
Hemlock's set to attend a high-level
Imperial summit in two rotations.

01:13.875 --> 01:14.958
Where?

01:15.583 --> 01:18.041
Tarkin's compound on Eriadu.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.083
If we do a covert infiltration,

01:20.083 --> 01:24.833
we can plant a homing beacon on
Hemlock's ship and track him to his base.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.250
And to Crosshair.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.000
Hmm, it won't be that simple.

01:28.875 --> 01:33.333
We'd be at a tactical disadvantage,
and I'm not sure it's worth the risk.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.166
I understand your hesitation.

01:35.166 --> 01:39.166
We have not always agreed with Crosshair,
but he is still our brother.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.500
We do not leave our own behind.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.125
If there's a chance to get him back,
we have to take it.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.666
- Definitely.
- What about reinforcements?

01:46.666 --> 01:50.541
Well, Rex is on a separate mission,
so it's just us.

01:51.166 --> 01:55.166
A small enough team to get in and out
without alerting them.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.750
But we'll need to move quickly.

01:58.458 --> 02:01.625
Well, then let's get started.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.958
So, where you all headed?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.375
It's a covert mission.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.833
Oh, I see.

02:19.375 --> 02:22.083
Well, I expect details when you get back.

02:22.791 --> 02:23.958
Bye, Phee.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.541
So, you were just going to leave
without saying goodbye.

02:43.541 --> 02:44.916
That is correct.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.416
Did you require a briefing?

02:54.750 --> 03:00.291
You know, when two friends are talking,
it's called a conversation.

03:03.708 --> 03:06.125
Well, don't go running off

03:06.125 --> 03:09.250
with any pirates or smugglers
while you're gone.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.500
Yes.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.833
This mission should not involve either.

03:14.375 --> 03:18.000
That's not exactly what I was getting at.

03:25.416 --> 03:28.166
See you around, brown eyes.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.750
Governor Tarkin's been expecting you.

04:38.750 --> 04:39.833
This way.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.041
You're late, Hemlock.

05:06.166 --> 05:10.500
There were matters
that required my attention.

05:16.166 --> 05:20.041
Now that we're all finally here,
we can begin.

05:26.125 --> 05:30.541
I have identified a suitable location
to land outside their sensor range.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.916
How are we bypassing those cruisers?

05:33.916 --> 05:38.250
Using a clearance code Rex and I acquired
from one of our contacts.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.958
Good to have you back, Echo.

05:39.958 --> 05:42.208
Just like old times.

05:47.791 --> 05:51.625
Wrecker, man the tail gun. Just in case.

05:51.625 --> 05:52.708
You got it.

05:52.708 --> 05:54.250
Transmitting clearance codes.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.208
If this doesn't work,
be ready to fly out of here.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.500
<i>Vessel 1143, you are clear for approach.</i>

06:31.500 --> 06:32.791
Let's make this quick,

06:32.791 --> 06:35.333
before they realize
we didn't land at the base.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.166
What kind of approach are we making?

06:46.166 --> 06:47.958
A side-wind breach?

06:47.958 --> 06:49.833
It worked on Raxus.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.625
It won't work here.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.208
The Empire's protocols
have changed since then.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.916
Thanks to us.

06:57.541 --> 07:00.708
No tanks and no explosions
this time, Wrecker.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.541
Fine.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.416
Hmm.
The compound is heavily fortified.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.291
But there's a weak point
in the rail line that we can exploit.

07:42.916 --> 07:46.375
We'll sneak past the sensor
and hitch a ride under one of the cars.

07:46.375 --> 07:50.000
You mean hang? Over that?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.125
Well, it's the only way
to access the compound unnoticed.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.750
Tech, disable the sensor.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.250
That would trigger an alert.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.291
I can temporarily disrupt the feed,

08:00.291 --> 08:05.125
but I estimate only 30 seconds for us
to clear the zone before it reactivates.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.708
We must be precise.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.625
What? I can handle it!

08:44.708 --> 08:46.916
<i>Stand by.</i>

08:55.000 --> 08:56.958
<i>Another railcar is approaching.</i>

08:56.958 --> 08:58.250
<i>Are we set?</i>

08:58.250 --> 09:01.083
Not yet.

09:06.041 --> 09:09.250
Detecting a malfunction in sensor 38-11.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.458
Recycle the feed.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.416
The sensor is down. Move in!

09:30.875 --> 09:32.583
Anything from the sensor reading?

09:32.583 --> 09:33.666
Negative.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.708
- Run a full system diagnostic.
- Yes, sir.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.416
Halfway there.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.208
This isn't so bad.

09:49.583 --> 09:52.208
Never mind.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.750
Phased, widespread deployment
will ensure a secure military presence

10:29.750 --> 10:31.458
across all sectors.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.333
The galaxy is at a critical juncture.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.708
Where allegiances were once divided,

10:36.708 --> 10:40.916
we must establish a comprehensive strategy
for galactic unification

10:40.916 --> 10:45.000
to deter dissent
and rampant self-interest.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.375
Toward that end,

10:46.375 --> 10:50.500
Dr. Hemlock, what do you have to report
on your Advanced Science Division?

10:52.541 --> 10:56.958
The progress we are making
in the field of cloning is

10:56.958 --> 11:00.166
of great importance to the Emperor.

11:01.666 --> 11:08.416
Once we fully unlock the secrets
previously known only to the Kaminoans,

11:08.416 --> 11:11.291
we will ensure an enlightened society

11:11.291 --> 11:15.333
through their advanced technology
and molecular alteration.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.916
And how long will that take?

11:17.916 --> 11:21.583
The funding you have requested, Hemlock,
is quite substantial.

11:21.583 --> 11:25.125
Science is not something you rush.

11:25.625 --> 11:28.500
And with more clone troopers
being decommissioned,

11:28.500 --> 11:30.583
I have found a new purpose for them.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.958
Test subjects to aid in my research.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.375
That's a solution that solves
a number of problems.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.250
And these clones have agreed
to your experimentation?

11:42.250 --> 11:45.291
They are Imperial property.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.708
Their cooperation is not required.

11:47.708 --> 11:51.333
There are many in the Senate
who are fighting for clone rights.

11:51.333 --> 11:55.583
If word of this gets out,
it could prove detrimental to our goals.

11:55.583 --> 12:00.333
The location and operations
under my purview

12:00.333 --> 12:03.125
are far from the eyes and ears
of the Senate.

12:03.916 --> 12:05.791
And everyone else.

12:06.666 --> 12:11.291
If I may,
I served with the clones for many years.

12:11.291 --> 12:14.708
They are cunning warriors.
Loyal to the end.

12:14.708 --> 12:18.375
Are we all willing to just dismiss them
out of hand?

12:18.375 --> 12:20.916
I also served with the clones

12:20.916 --> 12:24.416
and found them, at times,
to be very unpredictable.

12:24.416 --> 12:29.541
Under Jedi leadership, they adopted
a concerning level of individuality.

12:29.541 --> 12:34.083
And what happens if they become aware
of what's happening

12:34.083 --> 12:36.208
and take up arms against us?

12:36.875 --> 12:39.041
Well, some already have.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.916
And we will deal with them,

12:40.916 --> 12:45.500
swiftly and unilaterally
to quell any threat of a clone uprising.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.958
Now, Commander Krennic,

12:47.958 --> 12:52.041
enlighten us to the status
of Project Star Dust.

12:52.583 --> 12:53.916
Yes, Governor Tarkin.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.958
Which ship is Hemlock's?

13:13.958 --> 13:18.375
We need to access
the hangar manifest from the control room.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.250
Tech, Echo, with me.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.291
You two, plant the homing beacon.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.583
I'll monitor their security channels.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.333
<i>Found it.</i>

13:53.333 --> 13:55.416
<i>Hemlock's shuttle is at docking lane four.</i>

13:55.416 --> 13:56.708
Copy that.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.666
Hmm. Something's not right.

14:01.500 --> 14:06.250
Many of the surveillance systems have had
cycled deactivations in various corridors.

14:06.791 --> 14:08.041
That is highly irregular,

14:08.041 --> 14:11.708
considering the number of top-ranking
Imperial officers present.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.666
Tech, let's check it out.

14:13.666 --> 14:15.375
Echo, keep an eye on things.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.041
That's Hemlock's ship.

14:26.875 --> 14:30.333
It's too exposed.
How are we supposed to get to it?

14:30.916 --> 14:34.833
There's not enough cover for me,
but there is for you.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.750
You think you can handle it?

14:37.750 --> 14:39.125
Not a problem.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.708
Hmm, good. Here, take the beacon.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.166
I'll keep an eye out.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.958
Okay, the homing beacon is secure.

15:34.958 --> 15:37.375
Wait. There's more heading your way.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.166
I'm pinned down.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.708
Stay in position. I'll divert them.

16:14.916 --> 16:15.875
Huh?

16:20.666 --> 16:22.000
- Hey, wait!
- Look out!

16:31.791 --> 16:32.875
Oh.

16:35.833 --> 16:36.958
Oops.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.666
Sir, we have a crane malfunction
in the hangar.

16:46.750 --> 16:50.750
And several surveillance systems appear
to be offline in sector 4.

16:50.750 --> 16:54.125
What?
Send a squad and secure the rail line.

17:00.666 --> 17:03.000
Another offline camera.

17:10.333 --> 17:14.000
This quadrant of the surveillance system
has been fully deactivated.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.333
I do not like this. We should leave.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.291
Tech.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.166
A thermal explosive.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.208
Someone is targeting this base.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.291
One charge will not cause much damage.

17:37.416 --> 17:39.416
Good thing we have more.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.541
Didn't expect to find you two here.

17:51.541 --> 17:52.916
Saw Gerrera.

17:52.916 --> 17:56.541
I told you on Onderon
you had a choice to make.

17:56.541 --> 17:58.041
Looks like you've chosen.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.000
Keep an eye out.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.916
What exactly is your plan here?

18:04.916 --> 18:09.708
I'm leveling this compound,
along with all the Imperials inside it.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.583
Can't let you do that.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.916
We're tracking one of the officers.

18:13.916 --> 18:17.583
We need to find his base where clones
are being imprisoned,

18:17.583 --> 18:18.916
including one of our own.

18:18.916 --> 18:22.166
You expect me to call this off
to save a few prisoners?

18:22.916 --> 18:25.291
We are trying to fight an Empire.

18:25.291 --> 18:28.166
Have you considered that
by destroying this facility

18:28.166 --> 18:32.375
you are wiping out any chance to gather
intel that could help your cause?

18:32.375 --> 18:35.750
Taking out several of their top commanders
is a good start.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.625
Well, that victory will be short-lived

18:38.625 --> 18:41.125
as their ranks
will quickly be replenished.

18:41.125 --> 18:42.541
Maybe so.

18:43.375 --> 18:46.541
But sacrifices have to be made
for the greater good.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.958
We have to go now.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.708
A security team's been alerted.

19:24.416 --> 19:25.958
We've been compromised.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.625
Get back to the rail line.

19:30.958 --> 19:33.541
Fall back. Get to the hangar.

19:33.541 --> 19:35.458
- We have to hit the command center.
- Too late.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.833
Get to a shuttle before they find
and disarm the explosives.

19:44.083 --> 19:48.333
<i>Sir, insurgents disguised
as troopers have infiltrated the compound.</i>

19:48.333 --> 19:52.291
Switch all communications
to encoded channels and find them.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.208
We will resume momentarily.

20:01.208 --> 20:03.500
Take your seats, gentlemen.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.583
As you can see, we are perfectly safe.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.125
- We need an access code.
- I'll override it.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.750
Get us out of here!

22:54.708 --> 22:55.708
We're losing power!

23:19.833 --> 23:23.541
This is going to be a problem.
