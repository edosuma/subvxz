18:27.316 --> 18:30.694
'On the other side,
there's what looks like a needle hole.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.738
'It stretches back to the eye socket.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.576
'The needle seems
to have planted a hostile enzyme

18:37.701 --> 18:39.786
'into the cells in the hippocampus.

18:39.911 --> 18:43.206
'It looks synthetic. Maybe
a biotech parasite. It's hard to say.

18:43.332 --> 18:45.292
'But it might explain why he was so hot.'

18:45.417 --> 18:47.085
So is this a URD or not?

18:47.210 --> 18:50.714
'If this is a drug,
it's like nothing I've seen before.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.841
'Licensed or unlicensed.'

18:54.217 --> 18:55.677
(Birds chirping)

18:55.802 --> 19:00.599
- What's that noise?
- 'Oh, that? I'm acclimatising.'

19:00.724 --> 19:03.977
- For what?
- 'I got my transfer, man.

19:04.102 --> 19:08.940
'To a rural detail. Can you believe it?
I'm getting out of this city.'

19:09.941 --> 19:11.360
Congratulations, Eddie.

19:11.485 --> 19:14.196
- 'That is not right.'
- What?

19:15.238 --> 19:17.199
'Still no DNA match, both networks.

19:17.324 --> 19:22.913
'Incredible. Get me something else from
the crime scene. I can't work with this.'

19:23.038 --> 19:28.335
Forget it. I've gotta do this by the book
these days, Eddie. You know that.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.754
'Come on, man.
My life just got interesting.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.547
'Don't you get it?

19:32.673 --> 19:36.927
'Even if this kid killed himself, somebody
showed up and took a piece of his brain.

19:37.052 --> 19:40.681
'There's gotta be something. A trace
of them back in the storage locker.'

19:40.806 --> 19:44.935
'Ambro Infinity lasts up
to five times longer than our rivals.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.937
- 'If you want safe play...'
- Hi.

19:47.062 --> 19:53.610
'...you have to play safe. Only Ambro
products carry my personal guarantee.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.822
'Ambro, playing safe.'

(Cocks gun)

20:58.675 --> 21:00.927
(Sobs)

21:02.637 --> 21:04.639
(Whimpers)

21:04.765 --> 21:07.267
Put your hands where I can see them.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.445
Hey!

21:20.447 --> 21:23.283
- Where is he?
- Where's who?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.412
Where's who?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.877
(Grunts)

21:48.099 --> 21:49.726
Stay there!

21:52.521 --> 21:54.898
Wait! Hold up!

22:44.239 --> 22:45.657
(Grunts)

23:19.649 --> 23:21.776
(Siren wails in the distance)

23:49.596 --> 23:51.681
(Beeping)

23:51.806 --> 23:53.725
- 'Dad!'
- What are you still doing up?

23:53.850 --> 23:57.896
- 'I can't stop reading that book.'
- Have you finished it yet?

23:58.021 --> 24:00.899
'Nearly. When I do,
can you get me another one?'

24:01.024 --> 24:02.734
Tell me what you liked about it.

24:02.859 --> 24:06.947
'Well, this guy invents a time machine
and he travels to the future,

24:07.072 --> 24:10.742
'which is ruled by these scary
sort of ape people who live underground.

24:10.867 --> 24:14.287
- 'They're called Morlocks.'
- Morlocks, eh?

24:14.412 --> 24:19.751
'And they feed on these other people,
who are like the good people called Eloi.'

24:20.794 --> 24:23.421
Great.
Well, tell me when you're finished.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.633
How's your mum?

24:26.758 --> 24:29.511
'She doesn't know I'm still awake.'

24:29.636 --> 24:31.554
I won't tell her, I promise.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.433
- 'Are you all right?'
- (Sighs) Yeah, I'm fine.

24:36.434 --> 24:39.270
I just hurt my shoulder. It's nothing.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.024
Keep talking to me.

24:43.149 --> 24:46.695
- 'What shall I talk about?'
- Dunno. Finish the story.

24:56.496 --> 25:01.251
(Donne) The thing is we had no idea
whether he was telling the truth or not.

25:01.376 --> 25:04.546
- (Nolan) So how did you find out?
- The smell.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.548
- (Nolan) Smell?
- Yeah.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.260
- Piss.
- No way.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.178
Yeah, it's true.

25:12.303 --> 25:17.934
The hardest motherfucker in the city is
pissing himself right there like a baby.

25:19.144 --> 25:22.355
And as it turns out
it wasn't even nerves.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.357
The fucker was incontinent!

25:24.482 --> 25:25.900
(Chuckles)

25:28.194 --> 25:29.904
Right, we'd better do this.

25:30.030 --> 25:33.908
- Let's make it quick, all right?
- (Nolan) You got somewhere better to go?

25:34.034 --> 25:36.995
(Coughs) Yeah. Maybe.

25:38.538 --> 25:43.084
So tell me, how does it work
with that girl of yours, Leona, huh?

25:43.209 --> 25:47.630
Do you load up on your whore and then
crawl home to the arms of your Madonna?

25:47.756 --> 25:52.260
- She is not a whore. She is a skin.
- Same difference where I come from.

25:52.385 --> 25:56.139
That's perhaps the reason why the only
person you get to fuck is yourself.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.059
Touched a bit of a nerve.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.603
Does Angie know you like
a bit of a fondle now and then?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.730
Fucking shut it, all right?

26:05.356 --> 26:08.651
All right, just...
Let's focus on the job, yeah?

26:08.777 --> 26:10.528
My point exactly.

26:14.949 --> 26:18.286
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You can party when you've finished.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.746
(Cocks gun)

26:19.871 --> 26:21.664
I need someone I can rely on.

26:21.790 --> 26:25.001
What the fuck's that...?
Where the fuck are you going?

26:25.126 --> 26:26.836
We'll shout if we need you.

26:27.796 --> 26:30.548
Oi! Oi, fuck Off!

26:30.673 --> 26:32.175
Fuck...

26:33.134 --> 26:34.928
Fuck you now!

26:40.016 --> 26:41.434
Fuck you.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.606
Yeah, fuck you!

26:47.774 --> 26:49.109
Fuck you.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.777
Fuck you.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.660
(Sniffs)

27:00.120 --> 27:01.746
(Coughs)

27:07.168 --> 27:08.837
(Grunts)

27:17.512 --> 27:20.890
Oi! Wake up!
Nolan needs backup now!

27:42.120 --> 27:45.748
- Grieves, where were you?
- (Man) Shut the fuck up!

27:45.874 --> 27:47.876
- Get me out of this!
- I said shut up!

27:52.922 --> 27:56.885
Take the fucker down!
Take the fucker down! Take him down!

28:09.939 --> 28:11.941
(Nolan screams)

28:15.278 --> 28:18.281
(Screaming drowns speech)

28:19.574 --> 28:21.743
(Beeping)

28:27.749 --> 28:29.375
(Sighs)

28:39.510 --> 28:41.054
Hey, wake up.

28:43.348 --> 28:45.058
Hey! Wake up.

28:55.318 --> 28:56.653
Hold still.

28:56.778 --> 29:00.698
- What are you doing?
- My job. I'm a Dreck.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.160
No! (Grunts)

29:04.285 --> 29:07.664
Hold still, hold still,
hold still, hold still.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.834
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.879
(Whimpers)

29:26.182 --> 29:27.684
Shit.

29:30.645 --> 29:33.982
So are you gonna tell me what
you were doing down there last night?

29:35.858 --> 29:38.528
You and your little friend
forget to pay your dealer?

29:38.653 --> 29:42.156
- My little friend?
- The dead guy.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.784
The stiff.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.954
He's dead?

29:48.079 --> 29:50.498
You would be
if you had half of your face missing.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.250
Do you know him?

29:55.253 --> 29:57.755
So he was your friend.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.966
My condolences.

30:00.091 --> 30:01.426
Fuck you!

30:03.386 --> 30:06.055
Mess with that unlicensed shit,
it only ends one way.

30:06.180 --> 30:09.475
- We don't do that. He didn't do that.
- No?

30:10.268 --> 30:13.396
Don't lie to me! Your arteries
are not good enough for you now?

30:13.521 --> 30:16.274
You and your boyfriend pump
that shit into your brain?

30:16.399 --> 30:18.109
(Screams) No!

30:21.571 --> 30:23.781
(Beeping)

30:25.825 --> 30:30.246
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I ran out of juice.
Let me get to the car.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.587
(Gasping)

30:37.712 --> 30:39.464
They work for Ambro.

30:43.051 --> 30:46.137
(Nolan) 'Gonna let me in on the joke?'
(Grieves) What joke?

30:46.262 --> 30:49.432
'Where you break into the storage house
and shoot the place to shit.

30:49.557 --> 30:51.851
'What did you do to yourself?'

30:51.976 --> 30:54.062
The gunman winged me. It's fine.

30:54.187 --> 30:56.147
'The gunman? Did you nick him?'

30:56.272 --> 30:58.566
No. He disappeared.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.360
'What, into thin air?

31:02.528 --> 31:06.032
'You went directly against a briefing.
Why?'

31:06.157 --> 31:08.701
We've got a body unregistered
on any system we have,

31:08.826 --> 31:12.747
and people running temperatures
in excess of 49 degrees.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.834
I mean, come on. Aren't you even
at least a bit curious about what this is?

31:16.959 --> 31:21.589
'You left the scene of a Code One
to go back to a low-priority sideshow?

31:21.714 --> 31:26.469
- 'I'm putting your status to orange.'
- What? That's absurd! I know what I saw!

31:26.594 --> 31:29.222
'I know it's been tough
for the last couple of months,

31:29.347 --> 31:33.101
'but I'll save you some embarrassment
and I'll cite personal mitigation.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.647
'You're on orange until further notice.

31:37.772 --> 31:40.274
'Now go and get me
some RAT bookings.'

31:50.827 --> 31:53.871
(Chief) 'On a good clay, you can see
all the way out to the Kindle.'

31:53.996 --> 31:57.500
- (Ellen) How many of those do you have?
- How many what?

31:57.625 --> 31:59.168
Good days.

32:00.211 --> 32:01.838
(Knock on door)

32:03.840 --> 32:07.385
- Where've you been? Come in!
- Sorry. I thought we were in your office.

32:07.510 --> 32:10.054
- The lift was bust.
- Kim...

32:11.556 --> 32:13.975
- This is Ellen Ambro.
- Ah. As in...

32:14.100 --> 32:17.145
Todd Ambro's wife.
Well done, Detective.

32:17.270 --> 32:20.606
And Chief Executive Officer
of the Ambro Company.

32:20.731 --> 32:23.234
Talk to me about the Kindle district.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.028
Well, it's the old industrial quarter
of the city.

32:26.154 --> 32:29.782
Mostly Chinese-run till the collapse
and they all scarpered back home.

32:29.907 --> 32:33.453
I didn't ask for a fucking history lesson.
I'm talking about last night.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.329
What was Grieves doing down there?

32:35.455 --> 32:38.624
The Kindle is his beat.
There was a body he wanted to identify.

32:38.749 --> 32:43.880
Didn't I make it clear that you were
to redirect all your Drecks to bust RATs?

32:44.005 --> 32:47.842
I bounced him back to orange. He won't
do it again. Not with his track record.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.304
That land belongs to us, Detective.

32:51.429 --> 32:54.474
- I thought that was just a rumour.
- Well, for once it's true.

32:55.224 --> 32:59.479
Over the next five years, we'll shift
our research to the Kindle district.

32:59.604 --> 33:03.900
As you know, our business involves
a high quota of highly sensitive testing.

33:04.025 --> 33:08.070
We can't have any rogue elements
in or around such an environment.

33:08.196 --> 33:10.239
Which means
keep your fucking snouts out.

33:10.364 --> 33:14.619
With respect, Grieves was investigating
a possible LRD-related homicide.

33:14.744 --> 33:17.371
- Suicide.
- We can't be sure of that.

33:17.497 --> 33:20.041
- We can.
- Sorry, we can what?

33:20.166 --> 33:23.085
We've made our enquiries
and we're happy with its conclusion.

33:23.211 --> 33:24.629
It's a suicide.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.882
I'll let you get back to work.

33:30.218 --> 33:34.222
Get this Grieves back on his leash and
I'll have my people draw up a contract.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.601
You really can see the Kindle from here.

33:43.314 --> 33:46.651
- What was that all about?
- What do you think it was all about?

33:46.776 --> 33:50.071
Your face isn't the only thing
needs fixing. We're talking resources.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.864
Big fat resources.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.618
- Can we partner with a drug company?
- Depends which one.

33:56.452 --> 33:59.372
With them behind us,
we can do whatever we fucking want.

34:00.665 --> 34:02.875
These are exciting times, Kim.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.797
We're looking at a new era for the city.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.924
The city or the Ambro Company?

34:11.050 --> 34:12.510
What's the difference?

34:18.891 --> 34:21.018
(Man) You need to see this.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.647
This is the CCTV footage
from the incident last night.

34:24.772 --> 34:27.190
The man is Grieves.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.902
- What about the girl?
- There's no record of her entering.

34:32.572 --> 34:35.866
We've got another body.
From the same place as the first one.

34:35.992 --> 34:39.036
- Only this one's alive.
- Exactly.

34:39.161 --> 34:42.039
Which means the drug must be stable.

34:42.164 --> 34:45.333
There's something else you should know.
He never called it in.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.049
(Ellen) The girl must still be with him.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.801
Find them.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.515
(Grieves) I need you to put her up
for a couple of days.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.894
Just until I sort out what's going on.
She needs help, Angie, please.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.523
- She isn't dangerous.
- She isn't dangerous?

35:08.816 --> 35:11.027
I mean, is she void?

35:11.152 --> 35:12.903
No. I don't know.

35:13.029 --> 35:15.781
- (Man) Miss?
- She'll be with you in a minute.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.825
(Angie) I'm coming.

35:17.950 --> 35:19.535
Fill me up.

35:35.343 --> 35:36.719
(Grieves) Huh?

35:40.473 --> 35:42.683
- Angie?
- You made the rules.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.312
You laid down the terms
for your recovery, not me.

35:48.648 --> 35:52.693
Now you want me to take in some girl
you picked up at a crime scene!

35:54.195 --> 35:57.531
To bring her into our home?
My home! Ben's home!

35:57.657 --> 36:00.493
I'm sorry.
I just didn't know what else to do.

36:00.618 --> 36:03.120
You do what you said you'd do.

36:03.245 --> 36:09.543
You come to our house on Saturday
without your gun and... your darkness.

36:09.669 --> 36:14.715
And you take part in our lives like
a normal, everyday father and husband.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.636
That's all you have to do.

36:21.514 --> 36:23.140
(Grieves) This is how it is.

36:23.265 --> 36:28.062
I'm this close to throwing you back
to whoever was trying to kill you.

36:28.187 --> 36:32.566
I know you're frightened, but you have
to trust someone or I can't help you.

36:34.026 --> 36:37.113
- If I keep you somewhere safe...
- You can't keep me against my will.

36:37.238 --> 36:41.325
With no positive ID,
I can do what the hell I like.

36:43.119 --> 36:45.538
I'm just trying to help you here.

36:52.503 --> 36:54.922
Why do people call you Dreck?

36:58.718 --> 37:02.263
Because we clean up the shit
that nobody else wants to.

37:04.974 --> 37:07.309
Are all police like you?

37:07.435 --> 37:09.770
- Like what?
- Angry.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.606
(Beeping)

37:13.941 --> 37:15.317
- Eddie.
- 'Get anything?'

37:15.443 --> 37:17.737
Double E6s.

37:19.321 --> 37:22.533
- 'What? You got another one?'
- Same location.

37:22.658 --> 37:25.202
I'm going to send you
a sample for an ID.

37:25.327 --> 37:28.789
- We must be missing something.
- 'Dead?'

37:28.914 --> 37:30.916
No.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.128
(Whistles)

37:34.920 --> 37:37.882
Shit. Eddie, I'm gonna have to go.
Call you back later.

37:40.217 --> 37:41.552
'Frank?'

37:41.677 --> 37:43.679
(Train passes overhead)

37:54.190 --> 37:56.442
Morning. Now, shut up. Move now!

38:07.661 --> 38:09.330
Hey!

38:10.498 --> 38:11.707
(Grunts)

38:23.594 --> 38:26.514
- 'What happened to you?'
- Shut up and tell me something.

38:26.639 --> 38:31.310
Is there any way DNA could be
changed or altered to avoid detection,

38:31.435 --> 38:33.145
like jamming the code or whatever?

38:33.270 --> 38:36.607
- 'Not that I've heard of. Why?'
- We have to make an ID on the first body.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.235
- 'It was incinerated this morning.'
- What?

38:39.360 --> 38:42.988
'Orders, Frank. We don't keep E6s
any more. It came from Nolan.'

38:45.908 --> 38:47.451
Fuck.

38:47.576 --> 38:51.372
- Anyone off-site who can help me?
- 'I'm not getting into this.'

38:51.497 --> 38:52.998
- Tell me.
- 'You're void.

38:53.123 --> 38:56.126
'But you know you really should consider
getting some help.

38:56.252 --> 38:58.295
'These patches, you strap them on...'

38:58.420 --> 39:00.339
(Horn blares)

39:01.757 --> 39:05.970
'OK. All right, there's a guy
called Yuri, Yuri Sidorov.

39:07.429 --> 39:11.684
'He used to be a genetic engineer
at a big pharma gig before deregulation.

39:11.809 --> 39:16.105
'The guy was a god. And then
one day he just jacked it all in.

39:19.108 --> 39:22.611
'He moved out into the Kindle district,
away from the centre.

39:23.863 --> 39:27.366
'I think he still hangs out there,
but he's got some kind of condition.

39:27.491 --> 39:31.412
'It's why he left his job.
Tell him I sent you.'

39:32.496 --> 39:34.081
(Grieves) 'Thanks, Eddie.'

39:37.668 --> 39:39.545
(Engine revs)

40:07.114 --> 40:09.742
I've got eyes on him,
but there's no sign of the girl.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.661
I'll check.

40:25.925 --> 40:27.760
(Moaning)

40:29.595 --> 40:31.513
(Man) What the fuck, man?

40:31.639 --> 40:33.515
(Pop music in background)

40:47.446 --> 40:48.948
How about me?

40:55.037 --> 40:56.664
(Grunting)

41:02.044 --> 41:03.712
Ambro, eh?

41:07.633 --> 41:09.885
He likes a bit of rough.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.356
(Russian music blares)

42:06.066 --> 42:07.568
Hello?

42:47.608 --> 42:49.610
(Russian music blaring)

42:58.619 --> 43:00.245
(Music stops)

43:02.372 --> 43:03.665
(Man) Hello?

43:08.879 --> 43:12.091
Stay where you are.
Don't come any closer.

43:13.300 --> 43:16.470
I can almost smell
the electrons on your body.

43:18.138 --> 43:21.725
Your phone. Put it in the box.

43:31.485 --> 43:33.112
Close the lid.

43:37.783 --> 43:39.618
Put your gun way.

43:44.373 --> 43:45.999
Who are you?

43:47.042 --> 43:51.505
Eddie Rankin sent me.
He said that you would help me.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.132
You are Dreck?

43:53.257 --> 43:55.217
I need you to take a look at something.

43:55.342 --> 43:57.719
- Eddie owes me money.
- How much?

43:57.845 --> 44:01.056
500. But I take 450 for cash.

44:01.181 --> 44:02.766
- Forget it.
- 300.

44:02.891 --> 44:05.519
Half now, half when I've helped you.

44:06.478 --> 44:07.855
Two.

44:08.814 --> 44:10.607
Yeah, done.

44:11.483 --> 44:14.111
- What have you got?
- This.

44:21.785 --> 44:23.370
Here, please.

44:26.123 --> 44:30.669
- Eddie said you have some condition.
- That's one way of describing it.

44:31.461 --> 44:36.967
Before I quit,
I calculated more than 3,000 ways

44:37.092 --> 44:40.220
in which to track
my movements, my habits.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.973
From the phone calls I was making...

44:44.224 --> 44:48.395
...the money I was spending,
the drugs I was buying.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.938
Everything.

44:51.356 --> 44:56.195
I was so full of protonic energy,
I could have illuminated an entire city.

44:58.322 --> 45:04.453
And then, for some reason,
my body, my brain began to reject it.

45:05.913 --> 45:08.874
I had no other option
but to move out here.

45:10.167 --> 45:15.047
I use only what radiation I need,
I stay alive.

45:16.298 --> 45:18.634
What do mean "reject"?

45:18.759 --> 45:24.056
You receive a phone call
within five feet of me, I get a headache.

45:25.682 --> 45:29.061
You make two,
my brain starts to embolise.

45:29.186 --> 45:32.064
Three, it starts dribbling out my ears.

45:34.191 --> 45:36.610
I need you to do a DNA test for me.

45:39.738 --> 45:40.948
Money.

45:47.663 --> 45:50.499
Thank you. Come back same time
tomorrow, I have something for you.

45:50.624 --> 45:54.544
- Why can't you do it now?
- Because I'm tired.

45:54.670 --> 45:58.590
Because it takes a long time.
Because I want to do it properly.

46:28.245 --> 46:29.788
(Beeping)

47:33.268 --> 47:35.479
(Mobile rings)

47:35.604 --> 47:37.939
- Hello?
- (Grieves) 'Hi. It's me.

47:38.065 --> 47:41.985
'Look, I'm... I'm sorry about earlier.'

47:44.404 --> 47:47.199
- 'Where are you?'
- I'm working.

47:47.324 --> 47:49.785
- 'How's your arm?'
- I'll live.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.703
'Huh. Good.'

47:51.828 --> 47:56.666
- At least until Saturday.
- 'Yeah. Angie?'

47:57.918 --> 47:59.127
'What?'

48:02.422 --> 48:07.928
- Are you still there?
- It's nothing. I'd better go.

48:08.053 --> 48:10.472
- 'See you Saturday.'
- OK.

48:11.515 --> 48:13.016
'Stay safe.'

48:14.434 --> 48:15.685
OK.

48:19.898 --> 48:21.233
(Sighs)

48:27.239 --> 48:28.407
(Beeping)

48:28.532 --> 48:29.950
Oh, fuck.

48:30.075 --> 48:31.785
(Sighs heavily)

48:31.910 --> 48:34.538
- 'Where have you been?'
- I ran out of juice.

48:34.663 --> 48:36.081
'Yes...

48:37.249 --> 48:40.794
- 'Were you in the Kindle district today?'
- What?

48:40.919 --> 48:42.504
'You heard me.'

48:42.629 --> 48:45.257
- I was following up a lead.
- 'Your status is orange!

48:45.382 --> 48:49.428
'You don't follow up leads
without checking in with me first!'

48:51.930 --> 48:56.143
'Some of the Drecks are having a social
at the Bloodbuzz. Put in an appearance.'

48:56.268 --> 48:58.770
- What, now?
- 'Yes, now.'

48:58.895 --> 49:02.357
- But I've got work to do.
- 'It can wait.'

49:15.370 --> 49:17.581
(Electronic dance music)

50:16.806 --> 50:20.352
Fuck me! It's the Lone Ranger!

50:20.477 --> 50:21.853
Come here!

50:21.978 --> 50:24.231
Everyone, this is my old buddy
Mr Frank Grieves!

50:24.356 --> 50:25.899
(Woman) We've met.

50:26.024 --> 50:28.318
You gotta try this shit.
It's on promotion.

50:28.443 --> 50:30.737
It's called a fucking Smaquari.

50:33.031 --> 50:35.116
- Old school.
- Whoo!

50:52.634 --> 50:55.178
- (Barman) What can I get you?
- Anything soft?

50:55.303 --> 50:57.013
Like what?

51:03.228 --> 51:04.980
Actually, don't bother.

51:15.156 --> 51:17.409
Hey! What the hell?

51:17.993 --> 51:19.828
Sorry, I thought you were
someone else.

51:19.953 --> 51:22.372
All right, Daddy.
Let's get out of the ladies'.

51:22.497 --> 51:24.207
It's all right. I got this covered.

51:24.332 --> 51:26.167
- Are you Dreck?
- That's right.

51:26.293 --> 51:29.045
- I thought we had an agreement.
- Not with me you don't!

51:31.298 --> 51:34.718
- Hey, Frankie, what's going on?
- This isn't gonna happen.

51:34.843 --> 51:36.886
You look like you need a hug.

51:37.887 --> 51:40.640
Relax, brother. Everyone loves you.

51:40.765 --> 51:43.560
I don't need your fucking love!

51:43.685 --> 51:45.270
Take him down! Take him down!

51:54.154 --> 51:56.823
What the fuck are you looking at?

52:18.345 --> 52:21.056
- You're early.
- I got bored. What have you got?

52:21.890 --> 52:23.767
Suits me, don't you think?

52:23.892 --> 52:26.019
Unfortunately, it's just a bracelet.

52:26.936 --> 52:28.938
- I can just take it back.
- You don't need this.

52:29.064 --> 52:32.442
- What do you need it for?
- Look at it. It's got a blank face.

52:32.567 --> 52:35.278
Maybe we should call Eddie.
See what he thinks.

52:35.403 --> 52:38.281
What are you doing?
No, don't, please.

52:39.407 --> 52:41.201
(Groans)

52:44.621 --> 52:47.540
Stop! Stop it!

52:51.503 --> 52:53.546
- You're sick!
- Yeah?

52:53.672 --> 52:58.301
After that shit you pulled in the tunnel,
what do you expect? A hug?

52:59.344 --> 53:00.762
Well?

53:04.599 --> 53:06.017
(Groans)

53:07.227 --> 53:10.647
The watch is fitted
with some kind of safety device.

53:10.772 --> 53:13.566
It works in contact with the owner.

53:16.236 --> 53:17.946
Show me.

53:21.366 --> 53:23.493
Give me your arm.

53:25.161 --> 53:26.746
And turn.

53:30.291 --> 53:31.710
There.

53:33.253 --> 53:35.046
Come on!

53:37.173 --> 53:38.675
(Beeping)

53:38.800 --> 53:42.011
- It's just a watch. Big deal.
- Oh, yeah, big deal.

53:43.596 --> 53:45.473
But look at the date.

53:47.183 --> 53:48.810
It just needs resetting.

53:50.729 --> 53:54.274
- That's one explanation.
- What's the other one?

53:56.067 --> 53:58.403
You wouldn't believe me.

54:01.156 --> 54:04.367
- The watch isn't wrong.
- (Grieves) Yes, it is.

54:04.492 --> 54:08.705
No, it's correct,
but not to you, not now.

54:08.830 --> 54:11.750
- It hasn't been manufactured yet.
- Then where did you get it?

54:11.875 --> 54:14.836
And the reason you can't find me
on your DNA network

54:14.961 --> 54:19.257
is because the date of my birth
isn't due for another two years!

54:19.382 --> 54:22.552
- There is no way you'll believe me.
- Damn right. Let's go.

54:22.677 --> 54:24.304
Where are you taking me?

54:24.429 --> 54:26.806
I put my job on the line
and this is what you give me?

54:26.931 --> 54:30.935
Some bullshit junkie fantasy?
I'm turning you in.

54:31.060 --> 54:32.395
Thanks for nothing!

54:32.520 --> 54:35.523
Wait! I tell you everything I know.
You give me my money now.

54:41.946 --> 54:43.448
I'll drop it by sometime.

54:43.573 --> 54:47.786
What, what, what is this you write here?
You write this?

54:49.454 --> 54:53.958
- Why? Do you know what it is?
- No, it's not a scientific term.

54:55.502 --> 54:57.253
It's some kind of...

54:59.881 --> 55:01.549
Shit!

55:37.794 --> 55:39.128
Fuck!

55:45.343 --> 55:47.387
(Metallic clattering)

56:04.946 --> 56:07.490
You've gotta stop doing that!

56:07.615 --> 56:12.871
I don't want any more stories
about 2044, watches or whatever.

56:12.996 --> 56:14.622
I just want the truth.

56:15.874 --> 56:17.917
I told you the truth.

56:18.042 --> 56:20.879
- What does Morlock refer to?
- What?

56:21.004 --> 56:23.381
Your fiancé or whatever he was,
he had...

56:23.506 --> 56:26.801
he had the word "Morlock"
imprinted in the proteins of his brain.

56:26.926 --> 56:28.636
- Did you say Morlock?
- Yes.

56:28.761 --> 56:31.180
Is that some kind of branding
or something?

56:32.223 --> 56:35.727
Is that the name of this drug you're
both using? Was it an Ambro drug?

56:35.852 --> 56:38.938
Or are they trying to get hold of it?
Answer me!

56:39.898 --> 56:42.108
Morlock has nothing to do with the drug.

56:42.233 --> 56:45.361
It's a word.
It means something else.

56:45.486 --> 56:48.114
I don't have time
for your fucking stupid games!

56:49.157 --> 56:51.326
- What is it?
- It's impossible.

56:51.451 --> 56:53.828
What's impossible? What's impossible?

56:53.953 --> 56:56.164
If it doesn't mean a drug,
what does it mean?

56:56.289 --> 56:58.041
Who are you?

57:00.168 --> 57:03.838
Come on. Hurry.
Hurry up! Get in the car!

57:11.512 --> 57:13.181
We've got him.

57:13.890 --> 57:16.893
- 'What do you want me to do?'
- Does he have the girl?

57:17.018 --> 57:19.520
- 'Yes.'
- We need her alive. Lose the Dreck.

57:22.774 --> 57:24.776
(Beeping)

57:24.901 --> 57:27.862
What the hell's that thing doing?

57:34.327 --> 57:35.370
Fuck!

57:46.255 --> 57:48.174
Need a jump-start?

57:50.677 --> 57:53.805
All right!
How's the face?

57:58.768 --> 58:00.645
(G roans)

58:01.980 --> 58:03.272
(Beeping)

58:05.316 --> 58:07.235
What the fuck is that?

58:24.377 --> 58:29.215
(Eva) 'It's a word.
It means something else.

58:35.847 --> 58:37.724
'Who are you?'

58:49.318 --> 58:50.945
(Knock on door)

59:01.456 --> 59:03.166
Hello! Ben?

59:03.291 --> 59:06.502
Is it Ben? How's it going, buddy?

59:06.627 --> 59:08.254
I'm OK.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.923
Would you like to see some magic?

59:11.049 --> 59:13.843
- What?
- Magic. You know?

59:13.968 --> 59:15.970
Now let me think.

59:16.095 --> 59:18.222
Wasn't it your birthday this week?

59:18.347 --> 59:20.016
How do you know that?

59:20.141 --> 59:23.144
Don't worry.
That's not the magic. This is.

59:24.312 --> 59:27.565
I-I-I'm not supposed to eat those.
My mum says.

59:27.690 --> 59:30.276
It'll be our little secret.

59:31.069 --> 59:33.154
I told you,
we don't want anything from you.

59:33.279 --> 59:36.616
Sorry. Am I disturbing?
Family time?

59:38.326 --> 59:42.163
My dad was supposed to come.
But he hasn't.

59:42.288 --> 59:45.124
What a bummer.
I'm sorry about that.

59:46.209 --> 59:50.713
It must be really hard
having to do this on your own.

59:53.633 --> 59:55.635
Just give me five minutes.

59:56.427 --> 59:57.929
That's all I ask.

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:10.024
(Sound muted)

01:00:23.996 --> 01:00:25.039
(Mobile rings)

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:28.042
- Yep?
- He wasn't at the wife's place.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:32.922
- Well, stick around and keep watch.
- All right. All right, cool.

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:38.344
(Sighs)

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:45.393
Where the fuck are you, Grieves?

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.766
They said you'd gone
on indefinite leave.

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:31.689
That you'd had a relapse,
that you'd molested some girl in a bar.

01:01:34.192 --> 01:01:37.153
You can't go on like this.
OK, you have to turn yourself in.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:41.240
They're searching for you in every corner
of the city. They will find you.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.492
The police and Ambro
are in this together.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.872
- What?
- They made a deal, Eddie.

01:01:47.997 --> 01:01:50.499
Ambro have taken over
the Kindle district.

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:54.086
Whatever they are doing there,
they are willing to kill to protect it,

01:01:54.212 --> 01:01:56.797
and they're using the police
to bury the evidence.

01:01:56.923 --> 01:02:00.051
- Oh, Jesus, Frank.
- I think it's a drug.

01:02:00.176 --> 01:02:04.680
The substance you found in the body.
I think Morlock is a drug.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.849
An experimental drug.

01:02:07.934 --> 01:02:09.977
- How do you know this?
- The girl!

01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:13.022
I saw her.

01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:18.611
They put a syringe... Some sort
of syringe, they put it in her eye.

01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:23.282
- That's how they got it into the brain?
- Yes.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.534
It would explain
the alloy traces on the body.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.829
- Exactly. There was something else.
- What?

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:32.083
She was wearing a watch,
some kind of homing device.

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:36.420
She was wearing a watch
and the date on it was 2044.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.466
- What?
- 2044, Eddie.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:43.219
Well, that's 20 years from now.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.431
Do you see?

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:50.434
No, I don't understand.

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:53.271
We were never supposed
to know about this...

01:02:53.396 --> 01:02:56.315
But, Frank,
you never reported any girl.

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:59.735
- No one saw any girl.
- Fuck that!

01:03:01.279 --> 01:03:03.823
They're from the future, Eddie.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.618
If we wanna identify the body,

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:12.123
we need to start looking for a child,
not a grown man!

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:16.002
You said it yourself. He was 29.

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:19.797
He was fucking 29.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:22.008
If he's from 2044...

01:03:24.135 --> 01:03:26.137
You're the fucking scientist, Eddie.

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.682
Please...

01:03:32.685 --> 01:03:35.688
Look, I got my transfer, OK?

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:42.236
In 12 hours, I'm on a plane out of here.
I don't wanna be a part of this any more.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:45.740
Can you explain Morlock to me? Hmm?

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:49.285
You need help, Frank, OK?
There are people who can do that.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.419
That's where I'm going.

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:01.255
Come and visit when you're better.

01:04:20.316 --> 01:04:21.650
Hey.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:31.077
Is it true?
Have we done a deal with Ambro?

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.289
Ooh. Who've you been talking to?

01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:40.586
Where is he?

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:44.423
I don't know.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:49.929
Please.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.140
I got my transfer.

01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.853
So I heard, yeah.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:04.360
(Screams and muffled groans)

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:07.363
(Choking)

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.383
(Music over dialogue)

01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:07.024
'Only Ambro products carry
with my personal guarantee.

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:11.278
'Ambro... playing safe.'

01:07:30.965 --> 01:07:32.424
(Shrieks)

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:55.990
It's all right.
There's a box in Ben's room.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:58.158
I need to get it.

01:07:58.284 --> 01:08:00.744
He wouldn't believe me
you weren't coming.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.292
He waited up for you
until he couldn't stay awake any more.

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:11.797
I had to carry him into his room
in the clothes he chose specially.

01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.969
I even caught him tidying up for you.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.725
God, he's nine years old,
he should be light-hearted!

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.144
He should be carefree and happy.

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:31.859
He should not be dealing with this shit
that you dump on us every single day!

01:08:31.984 --> 01:08:34.903
And now you're here
for some stupid box?

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:38.616
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- I'm sorry, Angie.

01:08:38.741 --> 01:08:40.783
I never wanted it to be like this.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.872
Liar! You spent your whole life
making it like this!

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:48.042
- I hate you! I hate you!
- One clay I'll explain all this.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:50.210
Right now,
the less you know, the better.

01:08:50.336 --> 01:08:54.465
- What's happening? I'm frightened!
- Shh. It's all right. It's just the drugs.

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:55.924
(Sobs)

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:59.511
I need you to be calm. Please.

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:03.932
I need you to let me do this.

01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:09.604
Please stay with us.

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:17.029
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

01:09:18.656 --> 01:09:20.282
I'm sorry.

01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:43.805
(Gun cocks)

01:09:52.481 --> 01:09:55.484
That book's really scary.
Why did you give it to me?

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.986
Sorry, I didn't wanna wake you.

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:03.242
There was this bit where the sun was
dying and there were no more people.

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:07.705
Just these horrid giant crabs. We're
not going to end up like that, are we?

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:09.998
Why would someone want to write that?

01:10:10.124 --> 01:10:14.336
No, we won't. I'm going
to make sure everything's all right.

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:21.719
Why didn't you come earlier?

01:10:24.555 --> 01:10:26.181
I'm sorry.

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:29.435
There's something going on.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.687
It's work.

01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:36.358
Try and get back to sleep, OK?

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:37.901
(TV blares)

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:42.406
(Ben) I told you, she always does that
when the people upstairs argue.

01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:47.411
It's the middle of the night.
There's no one's arguing.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:56.170
Get down.
And don't come out till I say so.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:58.630
- You're not going to shoot anyone?
- Get down.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:00.799
- Please don't kill anyone!
- Shh.

01:11:02.551 --> 01:11:04.094
Ben!

01:11:04.219 --> 01:11:05.971
Christ!

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:13.187
(Grunts)

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:22.905
(Glass shatters)

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.832
(Ben screams)

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.292
No!

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.937
Hold it! Angie, get in here.

01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:59.149
- Oh, my God! Ben!
- (Grieves) Get him out of here.

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:02.194
Don't even think about it!

01:12:10.536 --> 01:12:12.120
Show me your arm.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.710
(Grieves) 'An old gunshot wound.'
(Eddie) 'Probably from when he was a kid.'

01:12:22.756 --> 01:12:25.384
(Ben) 'They're called Morlocks.

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:27.886
- 'They're called Morlocks.'
- (Grieves) 'Morlock?'

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.974
(Eddie) 'Probably did it
when he was a kid.'

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:35.310
Frank? Frank? Frank, please!

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:37.896
Frank, we need to get Ben to a hospital.

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.404
- Keep him back!
- OK.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.660
Get him back, Angie!

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.712
(Ben groans)

01:13:09.011 --> 01:13:12.431
Dad! What happened to those men?

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:15.809
- Get in.
- Aren't you coming with us?

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:21.023
- Get him out of the city.
- We're not going without you.

01:13:21.148 --> 01:13:25.527
Shh, shh, shh. Go north.
Eddie's got a place up there.

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:27.487
It's in the middle of nowhere.

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:30.490
Go to the airport and buy two tickets.

01:13:30.616 --> 01:13:33.535
There's a plane that leaves
in less than two hours.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.288
Don't leave us, Daddy.
I'm frightened!

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:39.041
Frank, I don't understand.
I don't understand.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:45.839
If I come with you, they will kill us all.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.759
I'm sorry.

01:13:48.884 --> 01:13:50.928
I'm sorry for everything.

01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:53.347
You deserve better than me.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:57.601
Shh. Be brave. Be brave.

01:13:58.644 --> 01:14:00.812
Be brave.

01:14:00.938 --> 01:14:06.026
Now, soldier, you have got
the whole of your life ahead of you.

01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:09.321
- You are gonna do amazing things.
- Daddy!

01:14:10.906 --> 01:14:13.450
And if I hadn't screwed up everything,

01:14:13.575 --> 01:14:16.870
I would've earned the right...
to be there to watch.

01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:18.872
Oh, God! Frank!

01:14:19.623 --> 01:14:22.834
Remember... I love you.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.467
Now go. Go!

01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:56.243
So the watch you gave me,
it wasn't 20 years fast after all.

01:14:56.368 --> 01:14:57.786
No.

01:14:58.704 --> 01:15:00.247
The body, the...

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:03.166
The E6 I found was...

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:06.503
I think it was my son.

01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:11.967
- What?
- My son, Ben.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:17.973
He must've been looking for you.

01:15:18.098 --> 01:15:22.227
But why would he come looking for me?
I'm not a scientist any more.

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:26.815
This... this, this word "Morlock"
I don't understand it.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.110
But you... you understand it.

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:35.741
You think he was looking for me?

01:15:35.866 --> 01:15:39.494
What does a son do when he's in trouble?
He goes in search of the father.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:45.751
For centuries, man has been
trying to create a machine

01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:48.211
that would help him
pass through time.

01:15:48.336 --> 01:15:52.049
But all the while,
everything he needed was in here.

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:56.845
This... this is the time machine.

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:59.765
And the drug is the key.

01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:06.605
This changes everything.

01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:10.942
This technology in the hands
of the wrong people...

01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:23.663
I have to go back.
I have to try and stop them.

01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:29.503
A fellow countrymen of mine,
he... he spent his life

01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:32.964
studying what he called
the "Great River".

01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:35.926
Novikov he was called. Igor Novikov.

01:16:36.051 --> 01:16:38.428
He had this theory, a principle,

01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:41.807
that even if time travel existed,

01:16:41.932 --> 01:16:44.059
we could not change
the course of history.

01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:46.770
The best we could hope for
is to change the detail.

01:16:47.479 --> 01:16:51.775
- The river flows on relentless.
- (Cocks gun)

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.075
(Nolan) Waste of time...

01:17:03.495 --> 01:17:04.996
(Grieves whistles)

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:06.957
I wouldn't if I were you.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:12.546
- Frank! Oh, we've been worried sick.
- Don't.

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:18.343
- Come on, we're on your side.
- Don't fuck with me, Nolan.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:21.888
- How much do you know?
- What do you mean?

01:17:22.013 --> 01:17:26.434
- Have we signed a deal with Ambro?
- We?

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.228
The police.

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:30.772
Answer.

01:17:31.773 --> 01:17:33.316
Answer me!

01:17:34.151 --> 01:17:35.360
Yes.

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:39.865
- When?
- What does it matter?

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:42.909
- It's over. It's done.
- Done?

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:45.704
You have no idea what you've done.

01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:48.123
(Nolan) What do you know?
You're just a Dreck.

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:50.458
Just the scum who clear up
after the scum!

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.142
(Footsteps)

01:18:10.562 --> 01:18:12.522
Who the hell are you?

01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:34.836
Where is he?

01:18:39.925 --> 01:18:41.551
How did you find him?

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:44.095
(Nolan) The beauty of it is
he found us.

01:19:08.078 --> 01:19:11.915
Oh, my God. Look at you.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:17.003
You've been in the wars a bit,
haven't you, Frank?

01:19:18.338 --> 01:19:22.050
I mean, how could you have
just disappeared like that,

01:19:22.175 --> 01:19:24.886
without leaving word?

01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:27.013
A family man like you.

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:36.314
Where is he? Where is Ben?

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:39.276
Is that right, "Ben"? It is?

01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:41.611
Where is Ben, Frank?

01:19:44.364 --> 01:19:48.159
Now we don't want to hurt him.
Quite the opposite.

01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:51.913
We had to ensure that he survives.

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:54.541
Why?

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.419
You already have the drug.

01:19:57.544 --> 01:20:00.088
Yeah, well, we have and we haven't.

01:20:00.213 --> 01:20:02.841
We only have a partial formula.

01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:04.884
The drug we're using is very unstable,

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:08.054
so as you've seen,
it's only effective in short doses,

01:20:08.179 --> 01:20:11.224
meaning we can send you
where we want,

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:14.185
but unless you're dead,
we can't keep you there.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.730
So the drug's virtually useless.

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:21.443
We have enough to follow him

01:20:21.568 --> 01:20:25.655
in the hope that he has
a complete sample in his brain.

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:31.453
But you know that, don't you, Frank?

01:20:35.582 --> 01:20:37.792
You know that he's precious cargo.

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:43.173
We need him to be strong and healthy...

01:20:44.716 --> 01:20:46.134
...and safe.

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:50.347
I mean, we'll find him.
We'll find him eventually.

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.600
You know, the longer he's out there,
u n protected...

01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:58.480
Why don't you do us all a favour
and just tell us where he is, Frank?

01:20:58.605 --> 01:21:00.940
Speed this up a bit, right?

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.110
Please.

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:09.366
I don't have time for this.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:10.867
Time...

01:21:12.202 --> 01:21:15.580
The most precious commodity.

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:21.044
He who controls time,
controls everything.

01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:23.171
(Metallic clattering)

01:21:23.797 --> 01:21:26.549
Oh! Yeah, well, I knew
there was someone missing.

01:21:26.674 --> 01:21:30.178
No, Frank. No, don't do it. No!

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.679
(Groans)

01:21:33.098 --> 01:21:34.599
Yuri...

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:38.395
(Todd) Tell us where the boy is,
then we can leave all this behind us.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.854
No, Frank. Don't.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:44.359
This... This doesn't make me
happy at all.

01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:50.073
But I think you understand,
you leave me with no other choice.

01:21:50.198 --> 01:21:52.075
(Yuri) No, Frank.

01:21:54.953 --> 01:21:59.749
I know! I know, why don't we get Yuri
to call him for us? Shall we do that?

01:21:59.874 --> 01:22:02.252
No, listen.
He doesn't know where he is!

01:22:02.377 --> 01:22:04.504
- What's the number?
- No, don't.

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:07.048
- Here we go. Say hello.
- No, please, no!

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:08.258
(Screams)

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:26.234
Now look what you made me do!

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:30.989
Now there's a bloody mess!

01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:35.160
Now we have to clear it up!

01:22:36.286 --> 01:22:37.912
Bring it, please.

01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:44.586
(Grieves) No...

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:55.555
You know, it's funny,
but for a drugs manufacturer,

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.057
I'm really not very good at this at all.

01:23:04.856 --> 01:23:06.858
This is your last chance, Mr Grieves.

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:09.194
- Oh, you motherfucker!
- Grieves!

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.412
Well, look at that.

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:26.753
You two...

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:30.173
You're supposed to be detectives.

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:38.306
If you place any value
on your lives at all, find that boy.

01:23:38.431 --> 01:23:41.267
Get rid of this one too,
while you're at it.

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:53.196
(Coughs and gasps)

01:23:55.657 --> 01:23:57.992
Just tell us where the boy is.

01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:02.830
- You know I'd die first.
- (Donne) That's the problem, Frankie.

01:24:04.832 --> 01:24:06.501
We can't let you.

01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:10.171
Until you tell us where Ben is,
we're just gonna keep hurting you.

01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:14.425
And then when it looks like
you're gonna die, we'll stop.

01:24:14.551 --> 01:24:17.679
Then when you recover a little,
we'll start all over again.

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:19.639
(Chuckles)

01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:23.893
(Sighs)

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:41.828
Don't you miss this, Frankie?

01:24:44.872 --> 01:24:47.584
How easy it used to be to escape?

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:53.548
Just to disappear.
Even for a while, eh?

01:24:55.842 --> 01:24:57.468
(Gurgles)

01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:07.061
(Coughs and chokes)

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.110
(Coughs)

01:25:15.069 --> 01:25:17.071
I've got the munchies.

01:25:33.087 --> 01:25:35.673
Frank! Frank!

01:25:41.054 --> 01:25:43.723
Nolan, what the fuck are you doing?

01:25:43.848 --> 01:25:47.977
I'm not an idiot. When you give them
what they want, they'll kill me as well.

01:25:49.854 --> 01:25:51.981
If there's two of us,
I might get out alive.

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:54.776
You think Ambro was telling the truth?

01:25:54.901 --> 01:25:57.945
You really think that all he wants
is to keep Ben alive?

01:25:58.071 --> 01:26:00.281
I don't care. Come on.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.951
Oi! What are you doing?

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:07.955
Stay where you are! Get round there.

01:26:08.081 --> 01:26:11.292
- Come on! Get there!
- You're gonna shoot your way out?

01:26:11.417 --> 01:26:14.462
- Our only chance is doing this together.
- That's funny.

01:26:14.587 --> 01:26:17.006
- Please.
- And you...

01:26:17.882 --> 01:26:20.927
That thing... Ambro said
it can send you where you want.

01:26:21.052 --> 01:26:23.638
That's right,
but we can't keep you there.

01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:26.557
- (Nolan) Grieves, think about this.
- Shut up.

01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:30.228
- Send me to my son.
- Think about it!

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:32.397
- I've thought about it!
- You can't change this!

01:26:32.522 --> 01:26:33.940
I know.

01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:37.068
But you can change the details.

01:26:38.736 --> 01:26:40.113
Now do it.

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:45.576
(Shouting)

01:26:47.829 --> 01:26:49.539
- It's set.
- Don't give it to him!

01:26:49.664 --> 01:26:52.625
Do it! Do it!

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:55.545
Do it!

01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:57.171
(Shouting)

01:26:58.047 --> 01:26:59.716

You have to finish this.

You have to finish it, Ben.

How do you know?
I don't understand. I don't understand.

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:26.969

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:51.077
I got the message.

01:28:53.913 --> 01:28:55.122
The book.

01:28:56.374 --> 01:28:59.043
- (Eva) 'What message?'
- It's... Eva, it's OK.

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:03.381
It was the last thing that you gave me.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:10.346
Not the last thing.
