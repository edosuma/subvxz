00:10.802 --> 00:11.803
Hey, Mr. Bennett.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.014
Morning, Abby. You're here early.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.391
I got a meeting
with the principal before school.

00:16.474 --> 00:19.436
She's gonna lecture me about using
bad language in class.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.271
If I can't say "fuck," how can I get them

00:21.354 --> 00:22.605
-to shut the fuck up?
-[chuckles]

00:23.523 --> 00:25.275
You could threaten to pour

00:25.358 --> 00:28.778
their Aloha coconut body scrub
down the drain.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.405
Works with Colt.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.783
Would you mind watching Peyton
untill he gets back?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.619
I just don't think he really wants
to see me right now.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.497
Every relationship has its challenges.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.792
Obviously, I've had my share, so...

00:43.710 --> 00:45.378
If you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.633
Of course, Joanne's had lots of experience
with this kind of stuff, too. So...

00:51.301 --> 00:52.635
talk to either one of us.

00:53.845 --> 00:54.971
You should talk to Joanne.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.397
-Hey.
-Morning.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.692
So, am I late? I was...

01:07.817 --> 01:08.902
I lost track of time.

01:08.985 --> 01:09.986
[Abby] No, it's alright.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.571
Peyton's asleep. It's okay.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.240
She drooled all over
her "future genius" onesie, so...

01:14.324 --> 01:15.617
it's probably not a good sign.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.038
Well...

01:20.705 --> 01:22.207
you're both here. I need to...

01:22.665 --> 01:23.875
tell you guys something.

01:24.542 --> 01:28.296
No one else is interested
in the fall sale at Lululemon.

01:29.964 --> 01:30.799
Well, hold on.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.426
Turns out there's a...

01:33.885 --> 01:36.805

01:36.888 --> 01:37.806
[Drake barking]

01:38.264 --> 01:41.726
Lisa Neumann's got a photo of me there
right before the dam went down.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.355
Wha-- So is she gonna go to the police?

01:47.565 --> 01:48.817
She offered me a deal.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.446
She won't take the picture to the police
if I sell her the ranch.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.782
So...

01:56.658 --> 01:58.910
What do you wanna do?
The ranch is half yours.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.330
Are you asking us if you should
or should not go to jail?

02:02.413 --> 02:03.790
I'm gonna go with should not.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.543
That's it? Just...

02:06.918 --> 02:10.004
Lisa Neumann wins and all the other
ranchers downstream are screwed?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.882
-You know how lucky you are?
-[Abby] Hm.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.678
She coulda just turned that tape over
and said nothin' to you.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.597
Yeah, I guess. That's real nice of her.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.183
I'll give her a discount
on the sandwich I sell her

02:22.267 --> 02:24.018
when I'm working at fuckin' Subway.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.729
You brought this shit onto yourself

02:26.813 --> 02:29.357
when you decided to take the law
into your own hands.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.651
It's over, pal.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.862
You gotta take the deal.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.449
Yeah.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.368
Suppose you're right.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.122
Come on, Peyton.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.292
Let's go spend some quality time together,

02:47.375 --> 02:50.503
before you learn how to talk
and ruin everything like your dad.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.382
[door slams]

02:55.842 --> 02:57.677
I was looking at the divorce papers.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.017
Sure you wanna do this?

03:06.311 --> 03:07.896
You're the one who brought up divorce.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.648
I said the word "divorce."

03:11.357 --> 03:14.152
In the heat of the moment,
in an argument where I was pissed.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.072
You went to a lawyer,
sat down and had it put on paper.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.452
You know, when you first said it...

03:23.369 --> 03:25.955
[scoffs] I couldn't understand why
you were willing to give up on us.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.749
But you know what?
After you lied at the wedding,

03:27.832 --> 03:29.959
then asked me
to lie to the cops for you...

03:31.461 --> 03:32.837
I guess I gave up on us, too.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.424
I'm sorry about the ranch.

to apologize to you for the other day.

I shoulda never yelled at you
about some stupid grocery list.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.025
Let me ask you something.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.281
You think I was right to take down
that dam?

09:33.364 --> 09:35.616
Actually, I think it was pretty stupid.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.161

I'd think you were my dad.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.205

You were...
standing up for what you believe in.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.797
You were protecting your family
and other ranchers.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.299
That's never a bad thing.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.428
Would you say I'm a hero?

09:55.636 --> 09:56.971
I think it's crazy, but...

09:57.555 --> 09:59.515
people around town seem to disagree.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.434
-A hero?
-Stop.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.896
I mean, if somebody brings up
buildin' a statue,

10:06.188 --> 10:08.733
I want it to be full body.
I've been doing a lot of leg days.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.735
I wanna get these calves on display.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.572
That and just, like, fighting off
an angry pack of wolves,

10:14.655 --> 10:16.073
but they're also my friends.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.744

if they're your friends?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.371

to make sense of this?

[laughs]

10:25.499 --> 10:26.334
You know, I...

10:26.834 --> 10:28.919
I can see why people think you're a hero.

10:29.962 --> 10:34.091
I mean, to them, Neumann's Hill
is just a faceless, heartless corporation

10:34.467 --> 10:37.261
that's taking away their ranches,
and killin' our town.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.432
I mean, in some ways,
Neumann's Hill is nothing but a bully.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.935
Sometimes you gotta punch a bully
in the face so he'll back off.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.106
-You gotta stand up to him.
-That's right!

10:49.482 --> 10:52.109
Course, sometimes
when you punch that bully,

10:52.485 --> 10:55.237
you get your ass kicked.
We'll see how this one turns out.

10:57.073 --> 10:57.907
[Colt] Yeah.

or just full nude?

11:34.568 --> 11:36.987
The only thing I want that state
to show me

11:37.321 --> 11:38.698
is how to get out of it.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.493
-Alright. Give it a try.
-Yeah.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.299
Look at this thing.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.885
Business up front, party in the back.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.470
It's the mullet of vehicles.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.390
What happened to your Dodge?

12:05.141 --> 12:08.018
Locked itself in the garage
and turned itself on?

12:09.103 --> 12:12.231
Yeah. Well, what's the nicest way
to say this?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.735
My drug-addicted ex-wife
sold it for heroin.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.196
I gotta stop marrying women
I've only known a week.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.199
Mary's that far gone?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.578
Yeah, I'm sure it didn't help
that our wedding gifts to one another

12:25.661 --> 12:26.954
were drugs and alcohol.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.331
Shoulda gone with my first idea, but...

12:29.498 --> 12:32.793
who knows? I guess you can probably
cook crack in a bread maker, too.

12:34.086 --> 12:34.962
Alright.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.672
That might do it. Let's see.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.887
[engine cranks but doesn't start]

12:43.262 --> 12:44.764
God damn this thing!

12:45.055 --> 12:46.182
That shoulda worked.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.601
This whole thing would be a lot easier

12:48.684 --> 12:51.103
if the tools I needed weren't
in my stolen truck.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.022
That's alright. We'll find it.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.483
We're just finding out what it's not.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.819
It's like when Colt went to high school.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.489
Found out he wasn't good at math.

13:02.698 --> 13:03.741
Or English.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.367
Or history.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.497
You just gotta find the PE of this car.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.959
[growls] Perfect! This bolt's seized.
[sighs in frustration]

13:15.211 --> 13:17.087
"It only needs a little work," Colt said.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.756
This thing's a fuckin' piece of shit.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.217
The fact that he thinks
it'll make up for him losing the ranch

13:21.300 --> 13:22.551
and blowing my money, it's not.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.094
Just take a deep breath--

13:24.178 --> 13:26.806
I don't need one of your fucking speeches
right now. Okay?

13:26.889 --> 13:29.350
Since I got here,
I lost 40 thousand dollars,

13:29.433 --> 13:32.102
my truck, my wife, and my job.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.897
I just want one thing to fucking go my...

13:36.690 --> 13:39.902
-I fucking broke it. God damn this!
-[metallic bang]

13:40.110 --> 13:42.363
-Luke--
-Don't... fuckin' touch me!

13:50.871 --> 13:53.290
-Hey.
-Hey, Colt. Come on in.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.921
Did you look over my proposal?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.714
Sure did.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.009
Just made a couple changes in there.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.016
You added four zeros to my offer.

14:11.725 --> 14:12.560
Art of the deal.

14:14.478 --> 14:18.190
But you added them after
the decimal point, so it changes nothing.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.442
Shit!

14:21.902 --> 14:23.070
You win again, math.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.073
And what is this?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.449
Oh, that's...

14:27.700 --> 14:28.868
I just want it in writin' that

14:28.951 --> 14:31.620
you ain't gonna put the dam back up
after I sign.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.872
[Lisa laughs]

14:32.955 --> 14:34.623
This isn't a negotiation.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.959
I would counter with, "Yes, it is."

14:38.085 --> 14:40.379
I am giving you more than a fair price,

14:40.462 --> 14:42.631
but if you feel that you need more,

14:42.715 --> 14:45.676
I can throw in
a signed Peyton Manning ball.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.928
Lisa, this ain't about me.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.224
I'm not gonna... throw it in
for a signed football,

14:52.558 --> 14:55.394
or a jersey,
or John Elway's home address.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.272
Go ahead, write it down.
Give it to me and see what I do.

14:59.565 --> 15:03.152
[sighs] Colt, you're not in any position
to make demands.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.112
Lisa, you don't need the dam.

15:05.654 --> 15:06.572
You already won.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.158
I'm sellin' you my dream.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.495
I was gonna raise my kids on that ranch,
with my family.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.124
Now I'm gonna have to go back to work
for my dad. You work with him.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.293
How much more
do you want me to be punished?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.088
If I wanted to punish you,

15:23.172 --> 15:26.967
I would buy Sephora
and close all of their Colorado stores.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.095
[huffs] That would scare me
in a world without Ulta.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.184
Look, the Hollisters volunteer
down at the church every Sunday.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.811
The Kincaids, in the fall,
put up one of them corn mazes

15:37.895 --> 15:41.065
for the kids to run through.
Yeah, sure, last year I got lost in there

15:41.148 --> 15:44.401
but the Girl Scouts heard my cries
and they came in and saved me.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.780
These families are the fabric
of our community,

15:48.197 --> 15:49.907
and they depend on that stream.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.784
What about what my ranches need?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.953
You can afford to get water
from anywhere!

15:54.453 --> 15:56.747
But these people? This is all they got!

15:57.164 --> 15:59.833
If you wanna buy my ranch,
you can't put up the dam.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.168
It's the only way I'm signin'.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.712
Colt, sign, don't sign...

16:04.505 --> 16:07.091
those other ranchers aren't going to jail.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.218
You are.

16:14.848 --> 16:15.933
Do you really think

16:16.016 --> 16:19.061
that a jury of people from this town
are gonna side with you?

16:20.980 --> 16:25.234
And even if they do,
if, by some miracle, you win,

16:25.734 --> 16:26.568
that's fine.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.028
'Cause according to Ulta,

16:28.112 --> 16:32.157
I'm a "fall" and I will look great
in an orange jumpsuit.

16:39.164 --> 16:39.999
Hey.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.291
Hey.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.380
If I ever find out who invented Sudoku,
I'm gonna stab 'em in the neck:

16:46.463 --> 16:48.799
nine times, then five times,
then one time.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.344
Supposed to help with your memory.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.221
Well, must be workin',

16:54.304 --> 16:56.890
'cause I remember how much
I fuckin' hate puzzles.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.186
Listen, I think...

17:01.937 --> 17:03.605
we oughta take a trip somewhere.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.067
You wanna go to the Reagan Library,
you just ask.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.947
The second they move the Reagan Library
outta California, I'm there.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.115
[chuckles]

17:13.449 --> 17:15.617
I was thinking maybe somewhere
like Europe.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.871
As long as it's a place
where they fought the Nazis.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.748
Or at least didn't lay down.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.959
You wanna go to Europe? [laughs]

17:24.960 --> 17:28.088
You told me once,
"You can't spell 'Europe' without 'rope,'

17:28.172 --> 17:31.800
which is what I'm gonna hang myself with
if I ever have to go to Europe."

17:33.469 --> 17:34.720
With everything going on,

17:34.803 --> 17:37.264
we haven't had a chance
to celebrate our marriage.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.266
This could be our honeymoon.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.478
Oh, come on, we talked about that.
We don't need a honeymoon.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.648
Oh, come on. There must be someplace
in the world you'd like to see.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.568
Well, I've heard Thailand's beautiful.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.654
There must be someplace else
in the world you'd like to see.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.617
-Oh, Abby's here to pick up Peyton.
-[car door shuts]

17:56.700 --> 17:57.534
Hey!

17:57.951 --> 17:59.078
How about Spain?

17:59.703 --> 18:02.414
Oh, no, Joanne.
You having memory troubles again?

18:02.664 --> 18:04.083
We just got back from Spain.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.087
Colt, this is stupid, okay.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
You need to go back
and tell her you changed your mind.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.965
-[Colt] Yeah, stupid.
-Yeah!

18:12.216 --> 18:13.300
What's goin' on?

18:13.675 --> 18:14.927
Go on. Tell 'em.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.804
[Peyton moans]

18:17.346 --> 18:19.723
I asked Lisa Neumann
to keep the stream flowing.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.058
And she won't do it.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.393
So I ain't sellin' her my ranch.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.686
Are you kiddin' me?

18:25.437 --> 18:28.148
She gives you a lifeline
and this is what you do?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.692
We talked about this.
You're gonna go to jail.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.905
You know, I called my mom.
You know what she said?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.366
"Way to go, Colt!

18:37.908 --> 18:39.034
Great job!

18:39.284 --> 18:40.452
Fuck Lisa Neumann!"

18:41.495 --> 18:44.706
Mom stood up to that oil company
and got that pipeline shut down.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.418
And I'm standing up to Lisa Neumann
'cause building that dam is wrong.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.879
You're not gonna win this.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.966
Nobody thought Mom'd win.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.259
But she did.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.594
Otherwise,
if we'd had that pipeline money,

18:57.678 --> 19:00.597
we'd be havin' this argument
in our kick-ass above-ground pool.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.143
There's a lot of people in town
who agree with Colt.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.270
Well, I'm not one of them.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.984
-[door slams]
-[engine starts]

19:12.151 --> 19:13.694
She's got money and lawyers.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.239
-All you've got is your goddamn pride.
-[car drives away]

19:17.406 --> 19:19.658
Let's see what that pride gets you
in prison.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.161
You know...

19:23.328 --> 19:24.454
it's amazing.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.666
Everyone in this town

19:27.916 --> 19:29.835
understands how important this is.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.880
And the two people
I need to hear it from the most

19:33.213 --> 19:34.339
won't even support me.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.759
It's just un-fucking believable.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.396
[Beau] Hard to get her running
from back there.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.814
What you talkin' about?

19:50.898 --> 19:54.193
I'm in a duct-taped La-Z-Boy
in the back of a broken-down truck.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.154
If this was Talladega,
you'd need a wristband for this.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.363
[Beau chuckles]

19:59.281 --> 20:00.616
Got something for you.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.159
[Luke groans]

20:05.954 --> 20:07.539
Who is Pedro and...

20:07.915 --> 20:09.625
why are you giving me his tools?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.627
No, Pedro gave them to Rooster.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.545
Least that's what Rooster said.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.464
He probably stole 'em.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.218
I'm tryin' to do something nice.
Just fuckin' take 'em.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.470
Wow! Thank you.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.723
I've never been given
someone's son's friend's tools before.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.727
Rooster used to like to work on engines.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.437
Motorbikes.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.107
A lot of good mechanic's tools in there.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.987
Nothing would make me happier than to see
you and I get this Chevy running.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.531
And since it's a Chevy,

20:41.823 --> 20:44.660
I'll work on it again tomorrow
after it breaks down.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.371
Hey, um...

20:48.664 --> 20:49.831
about earlier...

20:51.375 --> 20:52.834
You know, being here,

20:53.627 --> 20:56.296
it's really given me something
to look forward to everyday...

20:57.547 --> 20:59.883
Got a lot more than money invested here.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.304
All that shit went down with Mary,
and then on top of it...

21:04.721 --> 21:06.598
Colt and the ranch, I just...

21:09.017 --> 21:09.851
I'm sorry.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.104
No reason to be sorry.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.314
You got a lot goin' on.

21:15.065 --> 21:15.941
We all do.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.027
Well, I think we both know
it's more than that for me.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.155
Who knew I'd be triggered
by something as tiny

21:22.239 --> 21:24.116
as my entire life turning to shit?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.160
Your life's going to shit?

21:27.869 --> 21:29.621
I might be going to Spain.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.000
What do you think?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.252
Well... pfff...

21:35.877 --> 21:38.505
earlier, I thought the engine
wasn't getting enough fuel.

21:38.588 --> 21:42.342
Now I'm starting to think maybe it was
getting too much. Maybe we flooded it.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.762
Maybe it's just as simple
as turning that fuel mixture screw

21:45.846 --> 21:47.764
a quarter-turn back.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.975
If it's that simple,
I'm gonna punch a wall,

21:50.058 --> 21:51.601
just to give you a heads-up.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.939
Okay...

22:00.527 --> 22:01.486
Alright.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.780
[engine cranks but doesn't start]

22:03.905 --> 22:04.990
[Luke chuckles] Okay.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.367
Thank God. That woulda killed me.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.580
You know, Beau, I just...

22:12.831 --> 22:16.209
It's not the first time this has happened
and I just wanna say thanks for...

22:16.793 --> 22:18.045
never giving up on me.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.381
Luke, you've become like a son to me.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.384
One of these days,
you'll have your own kid,

22:24.468 --> 22:28.972
and you'll understand
what a father's willing to do for his son.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.934
Hopefully, your son won't wear
his wife's yoga pants

22:33.018 --> 22:35.145
to work on Casual Friday.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.063
[Luke snorts]

22:38.899 --> 22:40.067
Alright. Well...

22:41.318 --> 22:42.986
We need to get this thing movin'.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.696
And I dunno what it is.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.491
We got compression,
we got fuel, we got spark.

22:49.034 --> 22:49.910
I don't know.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.787
Maybe the fuel's just no good.

22:53.663 --> 22:58.043
This thing hasn't run since
we just thought Elton John was a showman.

22:59.836 --> 23:03.465
Why don't we pour some fresh gas
right into the carburetor?

23:04.007 --> 23:05.717
That's crazy dangerous.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.428
Let's definitely do that.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.183
Do we have a safe word
in case things go sideways?

23:14.851 --> 23:18.438
I think the engine bursting into flames
will give us a hint.

23:21.858 --> 23:22.776
[Luke] Here we go.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.570
[engine cranks]

23:25.695 --> 23:26.905
-[engine starts]
-[Luke whoops]

23:26.988 --> 23:28.198
Come on!

23:28.698 --> 23:29.533
We did it!

23:30.367 --> 23:31.201
Oh!

23:31.284 --> 23:34.496
Alright, that's enough.
I just hug you to piss off Colt.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.668
[cows mooing]

23:49.219 --> 23:50.095
Hey.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.265
Wasn't sure
if you were still gonna be here,

23:53.348 --> 23:54.850
or if you were gonna be in jail.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.061
Not yet.

23:59.896 --> 24:00.814
I'm ready, though.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.277
Got a bottle of TRESemmé conditioner
taped to my inner thigh.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.573
You sure you wanna look good
for the guys in prison?

24:09.656 --> 24:10.490
[Colt snorts]

24:13.326 --> 24:14.578
Those are the divorce papers?

24:16.204 --> 24:17.038
Yeah.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.333
Where's Peyton?

24:21.501 --> 24:22.627
She's with my parents.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.504
Why?

24:26.089 --> 24:28.300
Didn't want her to see
her dad get arrested.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.888
Pretty sure that's a decision
you don't get to make on your own.

24:32.971 --> 24:33.805
[Abby scoffs]

24:35.307 --> 24:36.141
You kidding me?

24:37.100 --> 24:40.187
We're in this position 'cause you make
every decision on your own.

24:41.104 --> 24:44.274
You coulda taken Lisa's deal
and been inside right now with Peyton,

24:44.357 --> 24:48.195
singin' that fuckin' "Baby Shark" song
for the seven-millionth time.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.075
I know you think I'm stupid.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.580
Maybe I am.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.293
Wouldn't it have been worse
if I just gave up?

25:04.961 --> 25:08.298
Sell Lisa Neumann my ranch,
she's gonna put that dam right back up.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.344
Them other ranchers, downstream,
they're just screwed.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.054
I can come here and work for my dad.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.014
Those people ain't got a backup plan.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.307
Alright. That's fine.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.185
You keep worrying
about what's best for those ranchers

25:20.268 --> 25:22.896
and I'll worry about what's best
for Peyton.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.106
I worry about that all the time.

25:26.608 --> 25:27.984
When we got separated,

25:29.110 --> 25:32.072
you were worried about what kinda
role models we were gonna be for her.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.866
Well, this is the kinda role model
I wanna be.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.494
I want her to see that her dad...

25:38.537 --> 25:40.705
doesn't just quit when things get hard.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.500
He don't just stand up for himself
but for the community.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.961
He don't turn away
when others are getting pushed around.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.129
[laughing] This is bullshit.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.966
You weren't worrying about anyone
but yourself.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.468
Okay? You took down that dam,
to save your ranch,

25:53.552 --> 25:56.263
and if it helped anyone else,
it was just an accident.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.098
You're wrong.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.351
I'm in the right here. I'm a good person.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.106
Well, I mean, that's just bad timin'.

26:08.441 --> 26:09.317
[Wilkerson sighs]

26:11.653 --> 26:13.154
Come on, Bennett. Let's go.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.949
Shit. How did you get here, Wilkerson?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.159
Ain't you supposed to be
in a rear-facing seat?

26:18.952 --> 26:19.953
Just get in the car.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.298
Wait. You didn't sign these.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.385
If it's that important to you,
come get 'em signed at the jail.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.641
Hey. I think it's great what you're doing
for the community.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.101
[Colt] Fuck you, Wilkerson!

26:49.858 --> 26:50.692
[door knocks]

26:58.283 --> 26:59.326
Hey, Lisa.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.494
Hey, Beau.

27:03.538 --> 27:05.832
If you're here about Colt, I'm sorry.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.502
I offered him a way out
but he chose not to take it.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.006
I'm not here to argue.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.218
I told him to take your deal.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.764
I don't agree with Colt's decision,

27:20.847 --> 27:23.350
but he's my son
and I'd do anything for him.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.229
I want you to drop the charges.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.940
Why would I do that?

27:32.734 --> 27:35.153
'Cause if you do, I'll sell you my ranch.
