(ominous music)

01:25.153 --> 01:27.721
(loud sirens)

01:53.281 --> 01:57.151
- The wine makes your
lips look even redder.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.552
Like cherries.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.132
Our coats please, thank you.

02:13.867 --> 02:14.635
We should go.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.170
- Yes, let's go.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.363

(ticking)

04:38.111 --> 04:40.848
(ominous music)

04:57.698 --> 05:00.501
- You wanted me to take risks?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.903
I'll show you taking risks.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.873
(thrilling music)

05:10.944 --> 05:12.513
Give me the money.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.585
Give me all your money.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.522
(howling winds)

05:23.624 --> 05:24.758
- [Narrator] With the weather.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.093
Rachel what's
going on out there?

05:26.193 --> 05:27.094
- [Narrator] Thanks Dave, well--

05:27.194 --> 05:29.329
- Late again last night?

05:31.499 --> 05:34.101
- Just a few drinks after work.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.671
- You better dress warm,
it's an ice rink outside.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.706
- Yeah well.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.589
(ominous music)

06:07.100 --> 06:09.570
(loud ding)

06:20.548 --> 06:23.617

06:31.559 --> 06:32.660

morning Mr. Sironi.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.294
- Good morning Mr. Sironi.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.297
- [Narrator] Good morning sir.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.632
- Turn that heater off.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.667
- [Narrator] It's
keeping us warm sir.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.802
- [Sironi] Turn it off.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.074
(loud engine)

07:45.766 --> 07:48.936
(static)
(loud siren)

07:49.036 --> 07:50.037

07:50.137 --> 07:52.472
- [Narrator] Good
morning Mrs. Bianchini!

07:52.573 --> 07:54.441
Delighted to see you!

07:54.542 --> 07:56.844
We'll have you
inside in no time!

07:56.944 --> 07:58.078
- Someone call the
police and tell them

07:58.178 --> 07:59.346
it's a false alarm!

07:59.446 --> 08:00.614
Franklin, where the
hell's Franklin?

08:00.714 --> 08:01.815
- He's gone to turn
the power back on.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.116
- Tell him to turn
the alarm off!

08:03.216 --> 08:04.685
And hurry the hell up!

08:04.785 --> 08:06.854
In a minute Mrs. Bianchini.

08:06.954 --> 08:07.788
(loud beep)

08:07.888 --> 08:08.656
Ah, voila!

08:10.223 --> 08:12.893
- The alarm goes off
as if I was a criminal.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.729
(ominous music)

08:25.939 --> 08:28.508
Here, shove this through
your security system.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.409
- Certainly.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.978
- That's one week alone.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.013
- Looks like you had a very
successful week Mrs. Bianchini.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.849
Franklin here will have
it counted in no time.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.785
(loud shuffling)

08:41.922 --> 08:43.222
- So, correct me if I'm wrong,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.826
your total is $143,500 euros.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.595
- Yes.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.896
They do well on vacation,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.598
we have every right
haven't we Mr. Sironi?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.065
- Of course you
do Mrs. Bianchini,

08:52.165 --> 08:53.734
of course you do.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.636
Lawrence and Katie would
you go to the backroom

08:55.736 --> 08:58.005
and file what you have
to file in the backroom.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.007
Make sure Mrs.
Bianchini has everything

09:00.107 --> 09:01.642
that she desires.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.511
You're in very good
hands Mrs. Bianchini,

09:04.612 --> 09:06.013
very good hands.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.686
(triumphant music)

09:22.562 --> 09:25.766
(suspenseful music)

09:34.541 --> 09:36.443
- Detective Jonta sir,

09:36.543 --> 09:38.278
there's been a robbery
at the B.E. Bank.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.947
- Have hostages been taken?

09:40.047 --> 09:42.349
- No, the robber was long gone.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.516
It happened half an hour ago.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.218
- Giustino, I've
told you before,

09:45.318 --> 09:47.220
unless there's civil
war going on out there,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.056
that door needs to be knocked on

09:49.156 --> 09:51.191
before coming in here.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.559
- Yes sir.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.594
- Yes sir my ass.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.997
That's the third time
they've held up that bank.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.732
Now go and take the
oldest car in the lot

09:58.832 --> 10:01.234
and wait for me with
the engine running.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.135
- Okay.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.141
- It's days like this
that I need to be reminded

10:08.241 --> 10:10.277
why I thought becoming
a cop would be the

10:10.377 --> 10:12.212
best job in the world.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.683
My office is a dump,

10:15.783 --> 10:18.919
my area of
responsibility is a dump.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.157
The future of my
department, a dump.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.728
Honest people out there
who think they can

10:27.828 --> 10:29.697
do wrong and get away with it,

10:29.797 --> 10:32.265
that's what made me
want to be a cop.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.268
And today, this city is
getting away with nothing.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.138
(loud knocking)

10:38.238 --> 10:40.073
- [Man At Door] Good
morning detective.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.441
- Chief.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.175
- Clearly you heard
about B.E. Bank.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.744
- That place is cursed.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.645
- I wouldn't be putting
my savings in there.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.680
- I'm on the case,
I'm heading over

10:46.780 --> 10:48.982
there now with Giustino.

10:49.082 --> 10:49.950
- Giustino?

10:50.050 --> 10:50.818
You're sure?

10:50.918 --> 10:53.120
- You have a better idea?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.090
- Dear Giulia, you're
my world, my everything,

10:57.190 --> 10:59.159
and I cannot bear to
imagine a life without

10:59.259 --> 11:00.861
you by my side.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.263
I did this for you.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.700
I assure you I'd do
anything for your love.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.002
I'm waiting for you.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.138
- Yo man, I haven't
seen you here in ages.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.073
What can I get you?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.209
(melancholy music)

11:16.309 --> 11:17.144
- Drunk.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.860
- From my peripheral,
I thought the customer

11:32.960 --> 11:34.862
had a big scarf around his neck.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.329
But I was too cold to
move so I just figured

11:36.429 --> 11:39.266
I would find out when
he got to the counter.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.668
The first time I got
caught in a bank holdup

11:41.769 --> 11:43.136
I took a slap to the face.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.204
(loud slap)

11:44.304 --> 11:45.906
Robber didn't
appreciate my arms up

11:46.006 --> 11:47.941
because the bank was made
up of nothing but windows.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.642
The second time, I
took a slap because

11:49.743 --> 11:51.378
I looked the robber in the face.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.212
- [Robber] Put your head down!

11:52.312 --> 11:53.180
- What?!

11:53.280 --> 11:54.247
That is a hold up no no.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.216
This time, I knew
exactly how to avoid

11:56.316 --> 11:59.452
getting slapped
for a third time.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.989
(loud thud)

12:03.824 --> 12:05.592
- So you don't know what
this guy looked like?

12:05.692 --> 12:08.095
I mean you have no
idea whatsoever?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.729
So the criminal could be a man,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.398
or woman, or a
gorilla at this stage,

12:11.498 --> 12:15.735
strolls in here and is casually
handed, how much was it?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.570
- 140,000 euros sir.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.471
- 143,500.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.877
- And due to your surveillance
system being down,

12:23.977 --> 12:26.713
the suspect looks like snow.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.248
- Katia told me to
turn the alarm off

12:28.348 --> 12:30.984
because we were all going
deaf in here, so I did.

12:31.084 --> 12:31.952
- Katia!

12:34.387 --> 12:36.089
Did I tell you to
turn the alarm off?

12:36.189 --> 12:36.990
- Yes sir.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.060
I believe so sir.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.628
- Are you absolutely positive?

12:41.728 --> 12:43.363
- Well, I think so.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.532
- So you think so.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.934
- It doesn't matter.

12:47.034 --> 12:47.901
It doesn't matter who told who

12:48.001 --> 12:50.003
to turn the alarm off.

12:53.006 --> 12:57.210
Now let me see if I've
got this story straight.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.711
There are six.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.214
Six cameras in this bank.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.917
But because the security
system was turned off,

13:04.017 --> 13:06.920
none of them recorded
anything that took place here.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.822
To cut a long story short,

13:08.922 --> 13:10.757
our criminal takes the money,

13:10.858 --> 13:13.493
walks out of the bank
the same way he walks in

13:13.593 --> 13:15.963
without ever being noticed.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.066
Well can somebody explain to me

13:19.166 --> 13:21.168
in language that
I can understand,

13:21.268 --> 13:24.304
what the hell just
happened here today?

13:24.404 --> 13:27.107
(foreign music)

13:42.655 --> 13:45.425
(howling winds)

13:54.067 --> 13:56.436
- Details please.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.171
- I don't have any.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.673
- You serious?

14:00.773 --> 14:01.574
- Yup.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.378
- Well,

14:06.579 --> 14:10.183
thanks for coming home
early for a change.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.920
Reminds me what I'm missing.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.909
(ringing)

14:36.009 --> 14:37.210
- [Narrator] Hi this is Giulia,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.279
I'm not here for the moment but,

14:39.379 --> 14:42.515
just leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.151
- I can't really talk right now.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.420
The banks been robbed,
I won't be in tonight.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.621
I'll call you tomorrow.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.357
(loud beep)

14:50.457 --> 14:53.193
(foreign music)

15:08.308 --> 15:10.677
(loud siren)

15:14.081 --> 15:17.250
(melancholy music)

15:20.353 --> 15:22.956
(loud ringing)

15:32.899 --> 15:34.201
- 143,500 euro.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.372
143,500 euro.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.445
143,500 euro!

15:50.183 --> 15:52.552
Bank account overdrawn.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.221
Mortgage overdue.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.956
Park and fine, penalty fine,

15:57.057 --> 15:58.091
overdraft.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.029
(loud laughter)

16:06.399 --> 16:07.467
Let's do this.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.406
Oh keys, keys, keys, keys.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.979
(loud thud)

16:55.815 --> 16:59.386
- Are you gonna explain
to me who you work for?

16:59.486 --> 17:00.820
- What?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.722
- Who do you work for?

17:03.990 --> 17:04.924
- Tony Di Lorenzo.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.626
- Tony Di Lorenzo?

17:06.726 --> 17:07.727
Never heard of him.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.396
- He's the owner of the company.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.762
- What company?

17:10.863 --> 17:13.900
- The Lorenzo Transport, I
used to work in accounting.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.203
- You work in accounting?

17:20.006 --> 17:22.709
They give you this
in accounting?

17:25.645 --> 17:26.246
- Are you police?

17:26.346 --> 17:27.180
- No I'm not the police.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.147
- Are you arresting me?

17:28.248 --> 17:28.948
- No I'm not arresting you.

17:29.048 --> 17:29.982
- I robbed a bank.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.519
- You robbed a bank with this?

17:34.654 --> 17:37.924
- The money's on the
table, just take it,

17:38.024 --> 17:40.393
just take it, take it all.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.328
Please.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.902
So are you gonna
arrest me or what?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.371
- Did I give you
brain damage or do you

17:51.471 --> 17:53.973
always ask the same questions?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.876
- I don't know, maybe both.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.111
This broccoli is
stinging my eye.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.912
- Did I give you brain damage

18:00.012 --> 18:03.383
or do you always ask
the same question?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.219
- You just asked me that.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.256
- Yeah, I know,
annoying isn't it?

18:10.957 --> 18:12.725
Gaetano Lolli.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.327
I'm your new neighbor.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.795
- I don't know what
apartment you came from

18:15.895 --> 18:17.497
but normally when someone
new moves into the building

18:17.597 --> 18:19.399
we bake them a cake
not punch them in the--

18:19.499 --> 18:21.201
- Where the building came from,

18:21.301 --> 18:24.571
if you're holding a
gun they jump you.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.314
I hope you feel better.

18:34.414 --> 18:38.651
And I'd be careful flashing
these bills around money bags.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.134
- [Sironi] Do you care to
tell me what's so funny?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.436
- [Narrator]
Nothing's funny sir.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.137
- [Sironi] Nothing's
funny, nothing at all.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.440
Then why do you have a
funny look on your face?!

19:00.540 --> 19:01.674
- [Narrator] I'm not sure, I--

19:01.774 --> 19:04.777
- [Sironi] It's
there all the time!

19:04.877 --> 19:06.746
Do you find that
we're all funny?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.114
- I don't know.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.749
My mother always said
that I was a happy baby.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.683
- Come in!

19:12.952 --> 19:14.454
- I brought you your coffee sir.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.955
- What, were you grinding
the beans with your hands?

19:16.055 --> 19:16.889
I asked for it an hour ago!

19:16.989 --> 19:18.225
Throw it in the plants!

19:18.325 --> 19:22.262
I don't wanna coffee,
I don't need a coffee!

19:22.362 --> 19:25.198
Why am I surrounded
by such incompetence?!

19:25.298 --> 19:26.366
If it's not funny boy Franklin,

19:26.466 --> 19:28.368
it's Katia the
constant interference.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.102
Don't even get me
started with that

19:30.203 --> 19:32.239
shivering wreck at the counter!

19:32.339 --> 19:34.574
If Mr. Fortis knew the habit--

19:34.674 --> 19:37.810
- I was just wondering if
I could deal with this.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.613
- I'll go see if he's available.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.785
(faint knocking)

19:45.885 --> 19:47.754
- [Sironi] Yes!

19:47.854 --> 19:48.855
- Mr. Sironi.

19:52.492 --> 19:56.195
There's someone here
who needs to see you.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.906
- I agree it's cold outside
but is that really necessary?

20:07.006 --> 20:09.676
You owe us a large sum of money.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.578
Did you lose your job?

20:13.045 --> 20:13.880
- Sorta.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.084
I quit.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.286
- What the hell did
you do to your eye?

20:19.386 --> 20:22.389
- I didn't do it,
someone else did.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.693
- Let me just pull up your file.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.227
Levati, Ruggero.

20:29.496 --> 20:30.697
Well you were employed in admin,

20:30.797 --> 20:32.765
says your wife works
in hospitality.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.434
- My wife left me.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.737
- Well I'm very sorry
to hear about that.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.306
I don't want to delve
into your private life.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.973
I'm sure you both
had your motives.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.543
However, that's no excuse for
not making your loan payments.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.077
- She wanted to start a business

20:45.177 --> 20:47.046
but I ran out of
money so she took

20:47.146 --> 20:49.882
all that was left and somehow

20:49.982 --> 20:52.719
managed to open a spa for men.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.688
(quizzical music)

20:58.691 --> 21:00.993
- Rugerro Levati and Giulia

21:05.698 --> 21:06.933
Redondini.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.267
- I mean let's be honest,
who wouldn't wanna

21:08.368 --> 21:11.804
be massaged by a
beautiful young woman

21:11.904 --> 21:13.806
rather than an old man.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.578
I know I would.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.955
- You owe a heck a lot
of money on your loan.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.424
5,410 euros to be exact.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.426
I'm going to need that
back tomorrow Mr. Levati.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.061
Otherwise I'm afraid--

21:35.161 --> 21:37.464
- [Levati] Is that enough?

21:45.338 --> 21:46.739
- You may want to
get yourself out of

21:46.839 --> 21:48.475
the red in your
current account--

21:48.575 --> 21:50.977
- How much in the red am I?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.382
- 3,813 euros.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.589
- Just take the lot.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.757
That ought to cover it.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.060
- Always a pleasant
surprise Mr. Levati.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.095
An inheritance?

22:09.195 --> 22:10.029
- No.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.833
Let's just say I robbed a bank.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.414
(slow paced music)

22:45.297 --> 22:47.667
(clanking)

22:50.269 --> 22:51.203
What are you doing here?

22:51.303 --> 22:52.405
- [Gaetano] Keeping warm.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.840
How's your eye?

22:56.075 --> 22:56.909
- Not bad.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.179
How did you get in?

23:00.279 --> 23:01.848
- I let myself in.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.217
Why are you bringing this
garbage in the house?

23:05.317 --> 23:06.819
- It's not garbage,
it's my lunch.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.220
- Disgusting.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.424
- That's my lunch,
what the hell...

23:14.594 --> 23:16.696
- My Nona passed this
recipe down to me.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.031
I perfected it
while I was in jail.

23:19.131 --> 23:23.503
You learn to make something
out of nothing there.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.172
- So what are you,

23:26.272 --> 23:27.807
a good guy or a bad guy?

23:27.907 --> 23:30.142
- I was an accountant
for some scumbags.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.111
- A loan shark or the mafia?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.613
- Ex loan shark.

23:35.114 --> 23:39.051
Until my associates turned
me in and I went to jail.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.455
- But you got out of jail so,

23:42.555 --> 23:44.757
it means you didn't do
anything too bad right?

23:44.857 --> 23:49.028
- Well, I did a deal with
the police on the inside.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.229
So there's a lot of
people on the outside

23:50.329 --> 23:52.164
who wanna see me dead.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.233
- Don't they normally
send people like

23:54.333 --> 23:55.668
you to another country?

23:55.768 --> 23:56.603
- Yeah.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.672
But I got some saving
from my accounting days

23:59.772 --> 24:02.842
and I need to collect
before I leave.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.947
It's in the bank.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.820
- Which you can't get to
because you could get killed.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.787
- Right.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.126
(romantic music)

24:26.398 --> 24:27.700
- You're late.

24:39.879 --> 24:40.947
I get it.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.649
Your bank was robbed
then we needed

24:42.749 --> 24:45.852
to move dinner to tonight,
I appreciate that.

24:45.952 --> 24:49.288
But now it's on the
table, cold again!

24:49.388 --> 24:51.057
- You know how yesterday sucked?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.258
Well so did today.

24:52.358 --> 24:55.094
- Well I'm sorry to hear that.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.596
The salon was a mess today.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.865
- Your ex-husband
paid me a visit today.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.232
- Ruggero?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.001
- Do you have any other husbands
that I don't know about?

25:02.101 --> 25:04.136
- What did he want?

25:04.236 --> 25:08.374
- He deposited 10
grand into his account.

25:08.474 --> 25:09.642
I can't work out if
he's screwing with me

25:09.742 --> 25:11.343
or if he really
doesn't know about us.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.312
- Of course he
doesn't know about us.

25:13.412 --> 25:14.747
And even if he did,

25:14.847 --> 25:15.982
he wouldn't go telling your wife

25:16.082 --> 25:17.784
if that's what
you're worried about.

25:17.884 --> 25:21.988
- No, what I'm worried
about Giulia is the cash.

25:23.255 --> 25:26.025
Where did he get it from?

25:26.125 --> 25:28.494
- How the hell am
I supposed to know?

25:28.595 --> 25:31.130
I left him the day
we got together.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.799
Remember?

25:32.899 --> 25:34.567
Well I let go of my world,

25:34.667 --> 25:37.970
but you still go home
to yours every night!

25:38.070 --> 25:39.606
- Listen.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.340
Yesterday my bank was robbed.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.011
It was the perfect crime,
perfect timing, no clues.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.046
Then your ex-husband
pays me a visit

25:47.146 --> 25:49.816
the next day with 10,000
euros in his pocket.

25:49.916 --> 25:50.817
And when I asked
him where he got it

25:50.917 --> 25:52.819
he says he robbed a bank.

25:52.919 --> 25:56.623
- Trust me, Ruggero isn't
capable of robbing a bank!

25:56.723 --> 25:59.926
- The robbery happened right
after Mrs. Bianchini left.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.628
You remember Mrs.
Bianchini don't you?

26:01.728 --> 26:02.762
- The one you call a rich bitch

26:02.862 --> 26:04.330
with the panel beating company.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.231
- Yes.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.669
The one that arrives
every Monday morning

26:09.769 --> 26:11.971
at 10 o'clock on the dot.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.208
(suspenseful music)

26:17.710 --> 26:20.446
- Do you think I told Ruggero?

26:20.546 --> 26:22.815
I don't even speak to him!

26:23.983 --> 26:26.653
- Whoever robbed my
bank did their homework

26:26.753 --> 26:28.320
really really well.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.258
And it's pointless you
stringing me along Giulia.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.360
I know people, and if
someone's messing with me

26:34.460 --> 26:35.862
I will use them.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.303
Giulia I'm sorry--

26:44.403 --> 26:45.304
- Get out!

26:45.404 --> 26:46.305
- Giulia please,

26:46.405 --> 26:47.606
- Get out!
- I'm sorry.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.342
- Get out or I'll
call the police!

26:53.846 --> 26:56.415
- I know my way out.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.652
But I will get to
the bottom of this!

27:11.864 --> 27:14.166
- [Jonta] So our favorite
banker has a mistress.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.168
- Giulia Redondini sir.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.171
Apparently she's a head turner.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.940
Long legs, athletic.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.677
- I didn't think you'd come
up with something useful.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.078
- Thank my wife sir.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.179
- Your wife?

27:27.279 --> 27:28.647
- Yeah, we live in
the same building

27:28.748 --> 27:30.950
where Giulia
Redondini used to live

27:31.050 --> 27:35.487
and where her loser
husband is still holed up.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.056
- Is that so?

27:37.156 --> 27:39.025
- Yeah, one day my wife
caught me staring at her butt

27:39.125 --> 27:42.261
when she was walking
down stairs and

27:43.863 --> 27:45.297
what a butt sir.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.734
Anyway, my wife was like,

27:47.834 --> 27:49.702
you can look all
you want because

27:49.802 --> 27:54.040
that's the most you'll get
from a woman like that.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.341
This morning I remember
her saying that

27:55.441 --> 27:56.675
she heard them fighting.

27:56.776 --> 28:00.780
So I called and asked if
she knew the guys name.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.183
She did.

28:05.551 --> 28:06.719
Elio Sironi.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.323
- Now go home, it's late.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.191
- Yes sir!

28:13.559 --> 28:15.027
- Hey, good job.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.263
- Thank you sir.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.898
- Thank your wife!

28:24.570 --> 28:25.738
Elio Sironi.

28:28.307 --> 28:31.243
(melancholy music)

28:43.655 --> 28:45.992
(ringing)

28:51.798 --> 28:52.598
- Hello.

28:52.698 --> 28:53.766
- Hello?

28:55.835 --> 28:57.069
- Giulia?

28:57.169 --> 28:58.004
- [Giulia] I'm sorry,
did I wake you up?

28:58.104 --> 29:00.773
- No, no, no, no, I mean,

29:00.873 --> 29:04.410
yeah, you know I don't
really sleep that much.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.744
- So how are you?

29:05.845 --> 29:07.746
- I'm fine, I guess.

29:09.849 --> 29:10.817
I miss you.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.051
- Please Ruggero don't start,

29:12.151 --> 29:13.319
I didn't call for that, please.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.923
- Okay fine, I don't
miss you and I'm fine.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.826
- I just called to see
what you were up to.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.260
I know it's early
but I knew otherwise

29:21.360 --> 29:23.162
I'd have to wait
until tonight to call

29:23.262 --> 29:25.764
because you know we're
both working and--

29:25.865 --> 29:28.534
- Yeah well, I'm
not working anymore.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.236
- You're not working?

29:30.336 --> 29:31.170
- I quit.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.073
- [Giulia] When?

29:34.907 --> 29:37.143
- When you left.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.946
My head just wasn't
in it anymore.

29:40.046 --> 29:43.415
I kept messing up
the figures and,

29:43.515 --> 29:44.483
yeah I quit.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.288
Now I just stay at home and

29:50.489 --> 29:51.991
think about us.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.693
- Ruggero you really have to
pull yourself together now.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.362
It's been nearly six months.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.663
- I know.

29:57.763 --> 29:58.630
- Living like this
can't be healthy.

29:58.730 --> 29:59.598
So how do you even pay bills?

29:59.698 --> 30:01.567
How do you buy groceries?

30:02.835 --> 30:03.702
- You really wanna know?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.437
- Yeah of course I do.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.705
I'm worried about you.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.208
- Then why don't we meet up?

30:14.380 --> 30:15.948
Giulia, you there?

30:16.916 --> 30:19.218
- Where do you want to meet?

30:20.319 --> 30:21.553
- Here.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.488
At our home.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.156
- No Ruggero not there.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.858
I don't wanna bump
into that slob

30:25.958 --> 30:28.494
on the second floor with
her pervert police husband

30:28.594 --> 30:29.828
gawking all over me.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.132
- Okay, okay, okay fine,
your house, wherever.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.066
- Okay.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.802
At my place.

30:36.903 --> 30:37.970
On Sunday okay?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.638
- Today would be better.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.373
- [Giulia] No, but
today's Wednesday.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.476
Wednesday's a
working day remember?

30:44.576 --> 30:46.112
Remember how that felt like?

30:46.212 --> 30:47.013
- Okay.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.181
- On Sunday, 8 am okay?

30:50.983 --> 30:53.319
We can have a coffee together.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.487
- Sounds delicious.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.389
- [Giulia] See you then.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.324
- Yeah.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.359
See ya then.

31:04.730 --> 31:07.366
(dog barking)

31:08.634 --> 31:10.102
- So here's the deal.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.771
A middle-aged banker
suffering a midlife crisis

31:12.871 --> 31:15.407
falls for a girl half his age.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.411
Thanks Tina, tell the
girls to be ready in five.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.346
- Okay.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.153
- The girl needs cash
for whatever reason

31:27.253 --> 31:29.155
and the banker's so
head over heels for her

31:29.255 --> 31:31.290
he finds a way to
make it happen.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.825
Somehow he gets in
touch with a crook.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.361
Gives him all the
information he needs

31:35.461 --> 31:37.196
to rob his own branch.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.198
Makes sure the surveillance
equipment isn't working

31:39.298 --> 31:41.900
when the crime takes place.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.702
The crook gets a cut,

31:43.802 --> 31:46.638
in his mistresses
eyes, he's a hero.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.407
It's a win-win-win.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.776
It all makes sense.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.279
Now I just have to prove it.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.450
Tanner, Tessa, let's go!

31:58.550 --> 32:00.119
- [Narrator] Things are looking
more positive out there.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.520
Here's the latest weather.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.689
Well it's still snowing
but it has eased.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.458
(loud ringing)

32:09.728 --> 32:11.998
Okay girls, see you later.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.069
The thing with
Sironi is that he is

32:17.169 --> 32:19.238
respected in the community.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.274
A Lions Club member, on the
board of his local church

32:22.374 --> 32:25.511
and of my own daughters school.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.547
But what do ya know,
he cheats on his wife

32:28.647 --> 32:30.749
and robs his own bank.

32:30.849 --> 32:32.118
If I mess this one up,

32:32.218 --> 32:34.953
it'll leave a permanent stain.

32:43.229 --> 32:46.432
(suspenseful music)

33:05.184 --> 33:09.955
- Hello Mr. Fortis, what
can I do for you sir?

33:10.056 --> 33:13.292
- Mr. Fortis what a
pleasant surprise.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.033
Take a seat.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.909
- Your third robbery
in six months.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.279
What the hell is going on?

33:34.446 --> 33:35.881
- Your guess is as good as mine.

33:35.981 --> 33:37.015
- Well yes.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.550
Let me guess.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.086
This will be fun.

33:43.222 --> 33:46.058
The surveillance
camera didn't work.

33:46.158 --> 33:49.161
The alarm system was turned off.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.098
I guess that robber is
one lucky son of a bitch.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.666
- Let me save you the
Inspector Clueso act

33:54.766 --> 33:56.068
and spell it out for you.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.036
All eyes are on me.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.605
- Come on Sironi.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.308
With the amount
of money you make

34:02.408 --> 34:05.611
you'd be an idiot to consider
robbing your own branch.

34:05.711 --> 34:06.512
- Agreed.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.617
- I want your resignation.

34:12.884 --> 34:13.819
- On what basis?

34:13.918 --> 34:14.719
Because my branch was robbed?

34:14.820 --> 34:15.920
- Robbed three times.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.724
Three inexplicable times.

34:18.824 --> 34:23.061
Not to mention between the
10th and 20th of February

34:23.161 --> 34:26.098
you were in
Sardaigne with a girl

34:27.766 --> 34:29.101
who is not your wife.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.670
- So you want me to resign
because of adultery?

34:31.770 --> 34:32.804
What is this, the Vatican?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.373
(laughter)

34:34.473 --> 34:36.408
- No, I would ask you to resign

34:36.507 --> 34:40.911
if I learned I went to an
exclusive resort in Sardaigne

34:41.012 --> 34:44.049
priced at at least
10,000 euros a head.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.219
But looking at your accounts,

34:47.319 --> 34:49.655
not a cent came out of it.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.424
- Well you have no right
to delve into my account!

34:52.524 --> 34:55.127
- Yes you're right, I don't.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.263
But I did.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.300
And so my question to you is,

35:01.400 --> 35:03.435
what side project
are you working on

35:03.535 --> 35:06.238
to pay for your side project?

35:08.974 --> 35:10.776
- It's an inheritance.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.612
- If you inherited that money,

35:13.712 --> 35:15.847
I'll walk out of here
with my head up my ass

35:15.947 --> 35:17.416
but I doubt you did.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.784
Sit down!

35:18.884 --> 35:21.887
(suspenseful music)

35:26.558 --> 35:29.328
So here's my ultimatum to you.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.698
Either you resign
or I'll put together

35:32.798 --> 35:37.236
all these little pieces and
present them to the police.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.975
- Okay, thinking
about this rationally,

35:44.075 --> 35:46.345
if I resign, what happens?

35:49.848 --> 35:50.782
- Who knows.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.786
The police will carry on
with their investigation

35:54.886 --> 35:56.488
without my help.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.491
If you're guilty
they'll jail you.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.394
But, for robbery not extortion.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.933
That will be our little secret.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.468
- A secret that can't be proven.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.402
- Perhaps.

36:14.139 --> 36:17.576
- How long do I have
to make up my mind?

36:19.044 --> 36:20.379
- Until Monday.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.228
(loud knocking)

36:36.328 --> 36:39.465
(slow paced music)

36:57.883 --> 36:59.551
- Did I come at a bad time?

36:59.651 --> 37:02.954
- [Ruggero] At least
you knocked this time.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.856
- How you feeling?

37:04.956 --> 37:06.625
- [Ruggero] Higher...

37:07.459 --> 37:09.361
- Oh, that good hey?

37:11.297 --> 37:14.300
Yeah, no feel the
same way myself.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.136
When are they turning
the heating back on?

37:18.236 --> 37:20.806
- He said sometimes next week.

37:22.173 --> 37:23.609
- Let's hope so.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.280
Ooh, she's a stunner.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.450
I can see why she ended it.

37:32.851 --> 37:36.655
Let me guess, first
girlfriend right?

37:36.755 --> 37:37.589
- Yeah.

37:39.891 --> 37:43.495
- Yeah she'd been
with a few before you,

37:44.996 --> 37:49.435
probably went with a few
during you as well right?

37:51.670 --> 37:54.606
- She had this little red dress.

37:56.408 --> 37:59.277
Whenever she put it on I
knew she was on the prowl.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.513
- Mmm, serial adulterer.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.350
That's bad news.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.853
But, you took her
back every time right?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.056
- She's my life.

38:13.024 --> 38:13.825
Still is.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.528
- Let me guess again,

38:16.628 --> 38:17.996
she followed you
out here because she

38:18.096 --> 38:19.297
thought she'd hit the lottery.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.233
But when things went sour,

38:22.334 --> 38:25.437
she put the red
dress back on again.

38:27.773 --> 38:28.874
- You're good.

38:33.712 --> 38:34.546
- Look.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.282
I get that you robbed a bank

38:37.383 --> 38:40.352
because you were
desperate for cash but,

38:40.452 --> 38:44.089
I don't know, it just
feels like to me that,

38:47.526 --> 38:49.828
you sorta wanted to
get caught didn't ya?

38:49.928 --> 38:52.864
(slow paced music)

38:55.667 --> 38:58.970
- I had a speech
prepared for 24 News.

39:01.072 --> 39:04.009
I wanted her to know
how much I loved her.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.544
How much she'd hurt me.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.746
And if I didn't get caught,

39:07.846 --> 39:09.147
I'd end up with
a bunch of money.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.649
It was a kind of a win-win.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.217
- Yeah, especially if
you were in prison.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.386
That's a great holiday.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.989
Look mate, the reason
I'm 55 years old

39:18.089 --> 39:20.325
and I've never been shot

39:20.426 --> 39:22.961
is because I know
how to read people.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.796
It's a gift.

39:24.896 --> 39:28.266
I know when to ask questions
and I know when to shut up.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.469
- I can see that.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.737
- Is that so?

39:33.739 --> 39:36.675
So how did you get
into accounting?

39:36.775 --> 39:39.611
- Actually, I studied
marine biology in Italy

39:39.711 --> 39:42.681
and came out here
as a researcher.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.388
- I would never have
picked you for an academic.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.258
- Ahh, I hate payroll
and bookkeeping but,

39:53.358 --> 39:55.461
well when I left my
research position

39:55.561 --> 39:57.228
it was all I could find.

39:57.328 --> 39:58.597
- Nah.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.532
Would you ever go back?

40:00.632 --> 40:02.400
I mean all that cash and
that horseshoe up your ass

40:02.501 --> 40:04.703
ain't gonna last forever.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.609
What would you say if I told you

40:12.811 --> 40:13.645
that I had

40:15.714 --> 40:18.183
a very well paying job for you?

40:18.283 --> 40:20.519
(whimsical music)

40:20.619 --> 40:23.689
(engine chugging)

40:32.464 --> 40:35.667
(suspenseful music)

40:52.017 --> 40:53.619
- Okay, okay, okay.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.358
- [Narrator] Next please.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.894
(mumbling)

41:08.500 --> 41:11.970
- Hello sir, what can
I do for you today?

41:13.672 --> 41:16.842
- I would like to
open my safe today.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.011
- Thank you.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.181
- Sir.

41:24.550 --> 41:27.085
- Thank you, follow me please.

41:30.622 --> 41:33.491
(upbeat music)

41:39.965 --> 41:41.066
- Hello.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.602
What can I do for you today?

41:45.203 --> 41:46.572
- I'm looking for a haircut.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.006
- I'm sorry sir, we
don't take hairstyle

41:48.106 --> 41:50.041
walk-ins on a Wednesday.

41:56.615 --> 41:59.484
- I'm embarrassed but
what about a back waxing?

41:59.585 --> 42:01.019
- That's possible.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.120
Just follow me please.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.154
- Thank you.

42:18.770 --> 42:20.038
- [Giulia] May I come in?

42:20.138 --> 42:21.439
- Yes of course.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.675
You work here don't you?

42:24.910 --> 42:27.112
- Well actually I do
more than work here.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.447
I own this place.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.784
- That's terrific,
then I'm in good hands.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.420
- I usually leave the
dirty work to my employees.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.924
But today, I'll just
torture you myself.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.195
(loud grunting)

42:44.295 --> 42:46.031
- That's hot.

42:46.131 --> 42:48.066
- And it will get
worse so prepare.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.736
- So tell me, how does
a young person like you

42:50.836 --> 42:53.104
come to own a place like this?

42:53.204 --> 42:56.074
I mean you must have had
to take out quite a loan.

42:56.174 --> 42:59.911
Or was it an inheritance
or a rich husband?

43:01.046 --> 43:02.714
- Well I'm married,
but my husband

43:02.814 --> 43:06.117
is definitely not
rich, not at all.

43:06.217 --> 43:07.452
Is your wife rich?

43:07.552 --> 43:08.687
- I found my wife
digging through

43:08.787 --> 43:11.389
garbage bins in the street.

43:11.489 --> 43:12.891
- So you're a romantic.

43:12.991 --> 43:15.894
- Travesty of marrying for love.

43:17.162 --> 43:18.229
(loud grunting)

43:18.329 --> 43:19.497
I think that's enough.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.266
I'm sure it looks great.

43:21.366 --> 43:22.600
- Are you sure?

43:22.701 --> 43:23.735
Because there's still
just a spot above--

43:23.835 --> 43:26.304
- I'll get it later
with a razor, thank you.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.205
- Okay.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.147
- With all this business to run

43:36.247 --> 43:38.850
you can't have any
time to yourself.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.452
- And why do you ask
so many questions?

43:41.552 --> 43:43.454
Are you spy with one
of my competitors?

43:43.554 --> 43:44.723
- Close.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.658
I'm a detective.

43:46.758 --> 43:49.227
Like a spy without the travel.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.898
Spies travel the world
looking for clues

43:52.998 --> 43:55.200
to solve their mysteries.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.837
But we detectives
know the best clues

43:58.937 --> 44:01.773
are right in front of our eyes.

44:01.873 --> 44:03.875
The most interesting
stuff is when

44:03.975 --> 44:08.213
normal people get involved
with abnormal activities.

44:13.952 --> 44:15.754
- Woo, what a rush!

44:17.288 --> 44:21.259
There was no one around
as far as I could tell.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.661
Nice fanny bag by the way.

44:24.529 --> 44:26.464
- Pochete amigo.

44:26.564 --> 44:29.000
Oh South America here I come.

44:33.939 --> 44:36.307
Take a look at what I've
been doing for you today.

44:36.407 --> 44:37.408
- Oh yeah.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.644
- Feast your eyes on that.

44:39.745 --> 44:42.080
Eggplant parmigiana lasagne

44:42.180 --> 44:45.416
and I even made you
some handmade penne.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.451
- Oh my God!

44:47.886 --> 44:48.854
Can I take it out?

44:48.954 --> 44:51.356
- [Gaetano] Yes, go right ahead.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.258
I'll get the other one.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.394
This my friend is a work of art.

44:56.494 --> 44:58.029
Look at this.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.397
- You know, I can get used
to this gangster lifestyle.

44:59.497 --> 45:00.698
- Is that so?

45:00.799 --> 45:02.801
- Yeah, I mean all this
undercover smuggling,

45:02.901 --> 45:05.503
the punches to the face, meals.

45:05.603 --> 45:08.473
Man you guys eat amazing meals!

45:08.573 --> 45:11.009
All it needs is some ketchup.

45:12.410 --> 45:13.912
- What'd you say?

45:17.182 --> 45:18.149
- I'm sorry.

45:20.952 --> 45:24.155
- I'm not sure you
even deserve this.

45:35.033 --> 45:37.936
- This, this is amazing.

45:38.036 --> 45:40.405
- So you're not brain dead then.

45:40.505 --> 45:42.240
- My god, thank you man.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.809
Thanks for all this.

45:43.909 --> 45:45.844
I mean if there's anything
else I can do for you just,

45:45.944 --> 45:48.646
you know, get my
hands dirty, whatever.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.415
- What about three more safes?

45:50.515 --> 45:51.783
- Sure.

45:51.883 --> 45:53.785
Like when do you
want me to start?

45:53.885 --> 45:55.286
- After you eat.

45:57.155 --> 45:59.290
The address is on the bottom.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.592
And if you really wanna
get your hands dirty,

46:01.692 --> 46:03.428
why don't you try
vacuuming under your bed

46:03.528 --> 46:06.264
once in a while,
it's disgusting.

46:11.302 --> 46:14.239
(slow paced music)

46:25.083 --> 46:26.551
- Valentino, a double espresso.

46:26.651 --> 46:27.785
- Yeah just one second.

46:27.886 --> 46:31.156
- [Narrator] Now,
hurry up it's Casoria.

46:39.497 --> 46:41.867
- Your double espresso sir.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.471
I'll come back with your change.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.376
- I don't need change.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.478
- Yes sir, thank you sir.

46:57.082 --> 47:00.185
(slow paced music)

47:01.286 --> 47:03.421
(ringing)

47:10.795 --> 47:12.263
Mr. Sironi.

47:12.363 --> 47:15.266
- Mr. Casoria,
long time no talk.

47:17.235 --> 47:18.803
Have I caught you at a bad time?

47:18.904 --> 47:21.873
- Naw, you never catch
me at a bad time.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.208
What can I do for you?

47:23.308 --> 47:24.642
- Well I was just
wondering if perhaps

47:24.742 --> 47:26.244
we could meet for
dinner this evening.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.413
I have some affairs I'd
like to discuss with you.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.216
- Alright, how does 9 o'clock
sound at Zia Teresa's?

47:31.316 --> 47:34.085
- Yeah that sounds grand, grand.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.820
Haven't a good meal
in a long while.

47:35.921 --> 47:37.989
- Don't tell your wife
that, she'll kill ya.

47:38.089 --> 47:39.757
- That's the least
of my worries.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.560
- Alright, we'll
see you at nine.

47:50.735 --> 47:52.337
- This

47:52.437 --> 47:53.271
is amazing.

47:55.440 --> 47:59.210
- You know when I
collect all my cash

47:59.310 --> 48:02.480
I'm gonna open a
restaurant in Brazil.

48:03.781 --> 48:06.884
I can't believe I'm
saying this but,

48:06.985 --> 48:09.787
you're welcome to join.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.957
- Awe, I appreciate
the offer but,

48:12.057 --> 48:14.492
I'm not the one in hiding.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.161
- What cave do you live in?!

48:16.261 --> 48:18.396
You know robbing a bank
is a major offense.

48:18.496 --> 48:21.799
So if I were you, I'd
be hiding that thing.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.368
Look, listen to me.

48:23.468 --> 48:24.769
There's beginners
luck and then there

48:24.869 --> 48:26.271
horseshoe up your ass luck,

48:26.371 --> 48:28.873
and there's whatever
magical land you live in.

48:28.974 --> 48:30.141
But you don't think
there were surveillance

48:30.241 --> 48:31.876
cameras that got a
shot of your face?

48:31.977 --> 48:33.844
- If they haven't
noticed me by now

48:33.945 --> 48:35.046
that's gotta be a
good thing right?

48:35.146 --> 48:37.582
I mean I robbed my own bank.

48:38.549 --> 48:40.085
- Sorry.

48:40.185 --> 48:41.119
- Yeah I robbed my own bank
where I have my mortgage,

48:41.219 --> 48:42.387
my account, everything.

48:42.487 --> 48:43.288
- No you didn't.

48:43.388 --> 48:44.422
- Yeah I did.

48:44.522 --> 48:45.790
- Your own bank?

48:45.890 --> 48:48.159
- And then I went back the next
day and deposited 10 grand.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.061
- But no one said anything?

48:50.161 --> 48:51.963
- Well the bank manager asked
me where I got the money.

48:52.063 --> 48:53.398
- And you said?

48:55.100 --> 48:57.602
- I told him I robbed a bank.

48:58.803 --> 48:59.837
- You're messing with me.

48:59.937 --> 49:00.871
- No I'm not.

49:00.972 --> 49:03.108
- You are messing with me.

49:05.010 --> 49:06.144
Well it's possible
that the surveillance

49:06.244 --> 49:07.412
cameras were down that day.

49:07.512 --> 49:09.014
I mean anything is
possible with you.

49:09.114 --> 49:10.448
Somebody must have
recognized you.

49:10.548 --> 49:12.583
- The employee there
didn't even look up at me.

49:12.683 --> 49:13.851
- What about when you ran out?

49:13.951 --> 49:16.487
- I didn't run out, I walked.

49:17.622 --> 49:18.423
- Oh?

49:21.192 --> 49:23.028
That's unbelievable.

49:23.128 --> 49:26.331
* Sing me a lullaby

49:32.570 --> 49:35.940
- Mr. Casoria, what
brings you here today?

49:36.041 --> 49:39.110
- Anto, what the hell
kind of question is that?

49:39.210 --> 49:41.179
What do you think I come
here for, your face?

49:41.279 --> 49:43.881
- Of course not, we'll
get your table ready.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.283
The one with your name on it.

49:45.383 --> 49:46.651
- I'm waiting for someone.

49:46.751 --> 49:48.153
- Oh, table for two then.

49:48.253 --> 49:49.187
Come have a seat.

49:49.287 --> 49:50.788
- [Sironi] Mr. Casoria.

49:50.888 --> 49:53.491
- Sironi, good to see you.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.060
How are things?

49:55.160 --> 49:56.894
- Well they could be better.

49:56.994 --> 49:59.097
- Before we have a seat,

49:59.197 --> 50:01.666
there's something that
could cheer you up.

50:01.766 --> 50:05.203
A little business capital
from the newstand venture.

50:05.303 --> 50:07.172
It's turning into a
real goldmine that one.

50:07.272 --> 50:08.873
- [Sironi] I appreciate that.

50:08.973 --> 50:10.641
- Hey, you a fan of fish?

50:10.741 --> 50:11.909
- Yes, yes I am.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.178
- Then you're in for a treat.

50:13.278 --> 50:16.114
They serve the
best fish in town.

50:27.592 --> 50:30.195
- Mr. Casoria is a
fish connoisseur .

50:30.295 --> 50:34.399
But if you will, allow me to
take care of your needs today.

50:34.499 --> 50:35.633
- Sounds good.

50:35.733 --> 50:37.135
But just no scorpion fish.

50:37.235 --> 50:39.404
I don't wanna lose
my life over dinner.

50:39.504 --> 50:40.305
(laughter)

50:40.405 --> 50:41.239
- No.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.475
- Fucking idiot.

50:55.320 --> 50:59.124
What's the matter Mr.
Sironi, you're not hungry?

50:59.224 --> 51:01.526
You know that's a
sign you're in love.

51:01.626 --> 51:04.795
- Yeah, well things aren't
going very well at the moment.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.164
- You're telling me.

51:06.264 --> 51:07.332
The first two robberies
we did at your

51:07.432 --> 51:09.834
dump of a bank were
a piece of cake.

51:09.934 --> 51:12.203
This time we got
beat to the punch.

51:12.303 --> 51:14.872
- I was just wondering,

51:14.972 --> 51:17.542
if a man in your line of work,

51:17.642 --> 51:18.843
of your stature,

51:20.145 --> 51:22.247
might be able to shed some light

51:22.347 --> 51:24.815
on who the criminal might be?

51:26.684 --> 51:27.785
- What am I a detective?

51:27.885 --> 51:30.388
- No, I just think it would be a

51:30.488 --> 51:33.791
really good idea to find
out who the culprit is.

51:33.891 --> 51:36.627
- Now are you a detective?

51:36.727 --> 51:39.897
- Mr. Casoria, there is
no trace of the robber

51:39.997 --> 51:42.032
or of the 150 grand
he took off with.

51:42.133 --> 51:44.135
I am just worried
that if the police

51:44.235 --> 51:46.437
start asking too many questions,

51:46.537 --> 51:48.673
rather than find out
who the robber is,

51:48.773 --> 51:49.607
they might

51:51.409 --> 51:53.711
pick up something about us.

52:06.291 --> 52:11.329
- You and I Mr. Sironi are
nothing more than acquaintances.

52:11.429 --> 52:15.132
In fact, we don't even call
each other by our first names.

52:15.233 --> 52:17.502
So you tell me Mr. Sironi,

52:19.237 --> 52:20.805
how the hell is
someone gonna find

52:20.905 --> 52:24.074
something out about you and me?

52:24.175 --> 52:27.845
- All I know if the
police ask me questions,

52:29.614 --> 52:32.650
I don't know how
things will end up.

52:32.750 --> 52:35.686
- Well that makes
the both of us.

52:37.555 --> 52:38.456
- Sante--

52:38.556 --> 52:39.357
- Elio.

52:45.196 --> 52:47.998
- Consider this
a personal favor.

52:48.098 --> 52:50.701
A favor I'm willing to pay for.

52:53.371 --> 52:54.805
Take this as a down payment.

52:54.905 --> 52:56.607
- Down payment for what?

52:56.707 --> 52:58.909
Listen, I'd try
to find this guy,

52:59.009 --> 53:02.112
but really it could've been
anyone that robbed your bank.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.282
- What if I had a lead?

53:07.618 --> 53:08.486
- Continue.

53:09.920 --> 53:14.191
- Well there's this woman,
an ex fling of mine.

53:14.292 --> 53:17.928
She might have tipped off
when and how to do it.

53:18.028 --> 53:18.896
She'd know.

53:22.032 --> 53:22.867
- Alright.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.476
I'll need her name and address.

53:31.576 --> 53:33.978
And I'll have my men
take care of the rest.

53:34.078 --> 53:36.247
- Please don't hurt her.

53:37.615 --> 53:40.285
- Hey, now why would we
wanna hurt an innocent woman?

53:40.385 --> 53:42.953
Your girl will be fine.

53:43.053 --> 53:43.888
Now.

53:44.989 --> 53:46.957
Name and address please.

53:49.960 --> 53:50.995
(loud beep)

53:51.095 --> 53:52.663
- [Sironi] Giulia it's Elio.

53:52.763 --> 53:55.966
Listen, I won't be angry if
you set this whole thing up.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.735
Just give me a ring.

53:57.835 --> 54:00.771
Tell me what really
happened and it'll be okay.

54:00.871 --> 54:01.672
Okay?

54:01.772 --> 54:03.207
Okay.

54:03.308 --> 54:04.875
(loud beep)

54:04.975 --> 54:08.579
Giulia, call me as soon
as you can, it's urgent.

54:08.679 --> 54:09.280
Thanks.

54:09.380 --> 54:10.615
(loud beep)

54:10.715 --> 54:12.016
I swear if you don't
come out with it

54:12.116 --> 54:13.851
I'll get the truth myself.

54:13.951 --> 54:15.085
Do you hear me?!

54:15.185 --> 54:16.521
Giulia, Giulia.

54:18.923 --> 54:19.824
I love you.

54:20.958 --> 54:22.026
(loud beep)

54:22.126 --> 54:23.694
Giulia I love you.

54:25.029 --> 54:26.130
- You can take your money!

54:26.230 --> 54:27.832
(loud shattering)

54:27.932 --> 54:29.033
And your gifts!

54:30.368 --> 54:32.036
And leave me alone!

54:36.874 --> 54:39.610
(loud doorbell)

54:47.552 --> 54:50.120
Oh Mrs. Landoni I'm sorry.

54:50.220 --> 54:51.789
- You're sorry?

54:51.889 --> 54:54.892
It sounds like a
bar fight in there.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.226
Is everything alright?

54:56.327 --> 54:57.795
- Yes everything's fine.

54:57.895 --> 54:59.430
I just had a long day.

54:59.530 --> 55:01.366
- Well, you know if
you need anything

55:01.466 --> 55:03.300
you know who to call.

55:03.401 --> 55:05.035
- Thank you Mrs.
Landoni, goodnight.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.937
- [Landoni] Goodnight.

55:08.238 --> 55:12.543
(loud engine)
(suspenseful music)

55:41.872 --> 55:44.442
(loud splash)

55:49.046 --> 55:50.280
- [Tina] Everything okay?

55:50.381 --> 55:52.683
- Everything's fine.

55:52.783 --> 55:55.119
I just have to make a call.

55:57.722 --> 55:58.556
Station.

56:02.493 --> 56:05.596
(slow paced music)

56:09.366 --> 56:10.167
Hey John.

56:10.267 --> 56:11.101
- Hi.

56:13.070 --> 56:14.038
- Good morning Susan.

56:14.138 --> 56:16.140
- Good morning.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.776
Chief's in your office already.

56:25.483 --> 56:27.117
- [Chief] How are
you doing detective?

56:27.217 --> 56:28.085
- I'm fine.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.356
- Fine enough to be
making an urgent call

56:32.457 --> 56:34.859
to the water operations
unit to scour

56:34.959 --> 56:38.596
the river for any
suspicious objects

56:38.696 --> 56:40.731
and the sketch team.

56:40.831 --> 56:44.635
You've been a stallion
for the police force.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.236
- With all due respect sir,

56:46.336 --> 56:47.605
are you firing me?

56:47.705 --> 56:49.840
- Of course not, I just think

56:49.940 --> 56:52.209
maybe you should take
a couple of weeks off.

56:52.309 --> 56:54.479
- I don't need a holiday.

56:54.579 --> 56:56.213
- Sorry to interrupt sir.

56:56.313 --> 56:57.848
- [Chief] Giustino.

56:57.948 --> 56:58.883
- Hello sir.

57:01.085 --> 57:03.888
The boys found quite a
few things down there sir.

57:03.988 --> 57:06.290
Even a toy gun,
nothing suspicious.

57:06.390 --> 57:08.092
- Any leads on witnesses?

57:08.192 --> 57:11.028
- None yet, but we are
definitely asking around.

57:11.128 --> 57:12.029
It was a busy night,

57:12.129 --> 57:13.263
someone's bound to pop up.

57:13.363 --> 57:14.932
- Good job Giustino,
now get some rest,

57:15.032 --> 57:16.300
you've had a long night.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.434
- Yes sir.

57:21.405 --> 57:24.174
- You should take
your own advice.

57:25.976 --> 57:27.512
It'll do you good.

57:44.361 --> 57:47.064
(ominous music)

57:49.634 --> 57:50.535
- What do you want from me?

57:50.635 --> 57:51.936
Do you want my purse?

57:52.036 --> 57:53.971
Do you want money,
what do you want?!

57:54.071 --> 57:55.305
- You know why I'm here.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.007
And it ain't for your money.

57:57.107 --> 58:01.111
Let's go back to your
place for a little chat.

58:03.948 --> 58:06.216
(screaming)

58:08.152 --> 58:10.855
- Giulia!
(dog barking)

58:10.955 --> 58:12.990
(sobbing)

58:13.090 --> 58:14.324
Giulia!

58:14.424 --> 58:15.693
What happened?

58:22.332 --> 58:25.369
- Ahh, celebrate good times.

58:25.469 --> 58:28.405
- These bank visits
are exhausting.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.275
- Compare a bank to a bad woman.

58:31.375 --> 58:33.177
Now they're exhausting.

58:33.277 --> 58:34.344
- You ever had one?

58:34.444 --> 58:35.245
- [Gaetano] What?

58:35.345 --> 58:36.881
- A broad I mean.

58:36.981 --> 58:38.515
- Yeah a girlfriend
I've had 'em.

58:38.616 --> 58:39.550
Look I was a gangster.

58:39.650 --> 58:41.318
Women love that kind of thing.

58:41.418 --> 58:42.452
But I'll tell you what.

58:42.553 --> 58:44.288
None of thems worth it.

58:44.388 --> 58:47.658
- Oh my, you gotta
be kidding me.

58:47.758 --> 58:50.427
White and milk chocolate
in one cornetto?

58:50.527 --> 58:51.295
- Oh yes.

58:51.395 --> 58:52.563
- Swirled?

58:52.663 --> 58:55.265
This is like a cure for racism!

58:56.634 --> 58:58.402
- You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

58:58.502 --> 59:01.038
but you're smarter
than you think.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.840
I call that le pardo.

59:02.940 --> 59:04.174
- I call it freaking awesome!

59:04.274 --> 59:06.243
- Well you know half the
race in Brazil is mix.

59:06.343 --> 59:08.879
So that's gonna be my
highest selling cornetti.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.447
- Well not if I
eat them all first.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.116
- Well you can't eat them all.

59:12.216 --> 59:13.383
- Why not?!

59:13.483 --> 59:14.384
- You know what?

59:14.484 --> 59:15.786
You're not coming to Brazil.

59:15.886 --> 59:17.021
- Just give me a couple
of hours, I'll be fine.

59:17.121 --> 59:19.189
(laughter)

59:19.289 --> 59:21.626
- Something wrong with you.

59:25.129 --> 59:27.632
(slow music)

59:36.674 --> 59:39.209
(ominous music)

59:39.309 --> 59:40.711
- Well?

59:40.811 --> 59:42.913
- I'm really sorry Zio.

59:44.548 --> 59:46.216
- No, no, I'm sorry.

59:46.316 --> 59:47.517
And you know why?

59:47.618 --> 59:48.518
Because I let a
girl go out there

59:48.619 --> 59:50.054
and do a mans job.

59:50.154 --> 59:53.290
- You said she left her
place every morning at 8:15.

59:53.390 --> 59:54.591
She was early.

59:54.692 --> 59:58.328
- Max, quit being a girl
and grow some balls.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.500
- Here, go get yourself
some breakfast.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.568
I'll deal with her myself.

01:00:04.669 --> 01:00:06.503
- I'm sorry Zio.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.638
- Go on.

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.178
Another fucking idiot.

01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:19.750
- [Landoni] You have to
go see a doctor dear.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.618
- Yeah, if it wasn't for me

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:23.420
and little Sparky
barking who knows

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.256
what would have happened.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.258
- You just lie back there now.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:29.559
That's a girl.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.761
- Mrs. Landoni I
really, I shouldn't.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:32.396
- Now should we
call your father?

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:33.898
- My father?

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.432
He's been dead for years.

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:36.433
- I thought I saw
him at your house

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:37.501
a couple of days ago?

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:38.535
- What?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.605
- You see, you're not with it.

01:00:41.706 --> 01:00:44.842
That thug knocked
your senses out.

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:47.778
Aldo, call Dr. Anderson
on the third floor.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:50.781
Tell him it's an emergency.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:53.550
- Mrs. Landoni, I really
appreciate your concern

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.352
but I have a business to run.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:56.486
I'll just go and work it off.

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:58.288
- Work it off?!

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.657
Over my dead body you will.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:04.795
And I have no intention
of dying any time soon.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:08.298
(slow music)

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:17.207
(beeping)

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:27.151
- [Narrator] I'm sorry.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:28.853
- Thank you kindly.

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:42.432
(faint doorbell)

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.877
(loud knocking)

01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:55.312
- You looking for someone?

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:56.580
- Yes ma'am.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.748
Sorry to bother you.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.016
I was just wondering if you knew

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:01.518
where the occupant of
that apartment was.

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.620
- The occupant of that apartment

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.890
left this morning on holidays.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:10.027
She left me in charge
of watering her plants.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.862
- Any idea when she'll be back?

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.163
- In about a month.

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:14.098
- A month?

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.169
It's a nice holiday.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:23.373
- She had a rough morning and
just booked it last minute.

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:25.475
Can I pass on a message?

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.844
- Yes you can.

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:30.881
My message applies
to you too ma'am.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:34.084
You ever think of
life after death?

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:36.921
- I'm sorry?

01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:39.523
- Do you believe in god ma'am?

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:42.326
- Look, I'm not interested okay.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:51.168
(slow paced music)

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:26.904
- Did you bring the pecorino?

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:36.013
There's nothing like full
bellies and full wallets.

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:39.216
- Have you been
trying to seduce me?

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.785
- Normally I'd kick
somebody in the ass

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:43.687
for saying something like that.

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:46.023
But tonight I'm
gonna let it slide.

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:48.458
Because tonight my friend,

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:50.827
we celebrate freedom.

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.630
Not too loudly, don't
wanna get killed.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:54.564
Here.

01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:58.235
- Cheers.

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:04.408
(ticking)
(slow paced music)

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.170
- And you said
you weren't tired.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.872
- Well those pills
were terrific.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:39.910
Think I haven't slept
like this in ages.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.479
- I know he's not your father.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:57.194
(buzzing)

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:04.434
- Hello.

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:07.671
- [Casoria] Mr.
Sironi, wakey wakey.

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.874
- Mr. Casoria is that you?

01:05:10.975 --> 01:05:12.076
- Surprise.

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:15.412
Now listen, we have
a little problem.

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:18.015
The girls gone, she
never showed up for work.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:19.716
Sounds like she might
be away for a month.

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:22.086
Can you wait that long?

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:24.221
- [Sironi] A month, hell no.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.655
This has to be done by Monday.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.791
- [Casoria] Monday?

01:05:27.891 --> 01:05:29.759
Any idea where we
could track her down?

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:31.461
- No, no.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:32.396
Well...

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:36.566
Well maybe at he
ex-husbands place.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.768
- Her ex-husband?!

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.105
You and I need to meet now!

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:42.772
- It's Saturday morning.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:44.074
- Yeah, well when
do we have to have

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:45.809
this all cleared up by?

01:05:45.909 --> 01:05:47.077
- By Monday.

01:05:48.212 --> 01:05:49.846
- I'll meet you
at the restaurant.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.582
(perky music)

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.668
(loud ringing)

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:21.078
- Hello?

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:23.613
- [Giulia] Hello,
is there any chance

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:26.650
I could speak with
Detective Jonta please?

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.984
- May I ask who's calling?

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:30.254
- Yes it's Giulia Redondini.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:32.722
The woman who waxed his
back a few days ago.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.524
- Waxed his back?

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:35.559
- [Giulia] Yes.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:36.660
- One moment.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.731
A woman who waxed your back

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:44.368
is calling for you

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:47.771
on a Saturday, in the morning.

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:50.074
She waxed your back?!

01:06:50.174 --> 01:06:51.541
- Tina, what's wrong with you?

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:54.044
That's my work phone.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:57.747
And I had my back waxed
to get information.

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:01.118
And it was very painful.

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:04.254
Detective Jonta speaking.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.590
- Yes hello, it's
Giulia, I waxed your back

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.857
a few days ago.

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.294
- Yes, I remember.

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:13.730
- I'm really sorry to bother
you out of the blue but,

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.565
I wonder if we could meet today?

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.601
I need to talk to
you about something.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.170
- Well I'll be in the
office this morning.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:21.138
- Well I don't
think I can make it

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:23.840
to your office because I've had

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.041
a bit of an accident.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:26.576
- An accident?!

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:30.447
- [Giulia] Yes, could you
come and visit me at my place?

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:31.248
- Yes.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:32.316
- That would be great.

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.383
- [Jonta] I'll see you then.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.451
- Thank you.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.821
- Tina, what is your problem?

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:43.293
- Well, it's just that
you're never here.

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:48.132
When you are it's as if
you don't even want to be.

01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:50.234
- Tina, you know what,

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.869
Tina, I've been
doing this for years.

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:54.904
You know what it's
like and right now

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:58.208
I'm in the middle of a really
complex case, that's all.

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:00.710
- I want to be
your complex case.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.679
- Well you are.

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:04.114
What I mean is,

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:08.017
you're my most important case.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.587
- They're just words.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:13.290
- Look, I'll go to
the office and see if

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.091
I can't get a half day.

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:16.993
Something like that.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.795
Would you like that?

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:20.863
- Yeah.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:21.798
- Good.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:23.466
(buzzing)

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:24.401
Go on.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:25.335
Read it.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:34.109
- "Got a witness, just finishing
with the sketch artist now.

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:36.446
"Giustino."

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:41.117
You're cheating on
me with Giustino.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.859
(slow paced music)

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:53.630
- [Gaetano] So how is it?

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.899
- Well, I'm certainly
gonna miss your breakfasts.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.702
Tomorrow especially.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.339
- [Gaetano] Tomorrow,
you got plans?

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:03.273
Here.

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:05.875
- I sure do.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:12.816
- Let me guess, you're gonna
go see that woman of yours?

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:13.983
- How do you know that?

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.719
- Oh I don't know.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:18.255
Maybe watching you look
at yourself in the mirror

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.524
in those dishrags you
call clothes for an hour.

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:23.760
Maybe it was you
ironing your socks.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.863
- You got any advice
you can give me?

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:27.796
- No.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:30.066
- What, none?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.401
- None.

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:32.636
If you was a normal
person I would say

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:35.939
stay the hell away from
her, she's bad news.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.506
But you're not normal.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:40.176
You rob banks without a plan
and you get away with it.

01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:42.078
I mean if the earth
was to flood tomorrow

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.380
you wouldn't even get wet.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:46.283
So no, I've got
no advice for you.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.321
What are you trying to do?!

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.189
Scrub a hole through it?

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.090
- No, just--

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.492
- First of all,

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:00.063
they always work a lot better
if you use one of these.

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.231
Plug it in.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:04.634
Get out me way.

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.274
- Good morning guys!

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:11.508
- [Everyone] Good
morning detective.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:14.177
- Having a busy
Saturday Giustino?

01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:15.779
- Yes sir.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.314
- Where's the artwork I
asked for, I need it fast.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:20.183
I have two appointments
in a half day.

01:10:20.284 --> 01:10:21.485
- There it is sir.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:23.152
They even did it
in color for you.

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.889
- Color aye, and it was night.

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.724
- The witness didn't have
much to say about the guy

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:30.827
except that he
looked pretty glum.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:35.899
He looks sketchy doesn't he?

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:38.067
Sketchy, it's a sketch.

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:40.003
You get it sir?

01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:42.806
Okay okay, I'll shut up.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:45.475
(perky music)

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:50.380
- The coast is clear.

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:02.191
- Okay dear, you take
care of yourself huh?

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:03.827
And tell that detective
friend of yours

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.595
everything that happened.

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:06.863
- Yes I will.

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:07.797
Thank you.

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:13.770
- And remember--

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:16.239
- Yes, lunch is at
12 o'clock sharp.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.341
Thank you.

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:29.118
- So do me a favor
and hang these up

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.655
because I ain't
doing them again.

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:32.589
Wait.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.326
You know I do have
some advice for you.

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:40.664
Something my grandfather
told me a long time ago.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:44.300
Act as a sheep and
a wolf will eat you.

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.474
- What does that mean?

01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:53.009
- I'll tell you but you
have to answer a question.

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:53.943
- Okay.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:58.314
- Why'd you leave your job?

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:00.283
- I already told you,
I needed the money

01:12:00.384 --> 01:12:02.986
and I couldn't be a
researcher all my life.

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:05.154
- So who needed the money more?

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.356
You or her?

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:09.626
- I thought you
said one question?

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:10.560
- Two part.

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:13.963
- Well I guess she did.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:16.933
- Thank you.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.202
- But she wasn't all wrong.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:20.837
I mean, what if we
were to have kids?

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:21.938
Kids are expensive.

01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:24.340
- Yeah but you didn't
have kids did ya?

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:27.243
- We decided to
leave it for a bit.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.478
- Three part.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:29.713
Who decided to wait?

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:30.914
You or her?

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.081
- We both did.

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:38.922
Maybe she did more than me.

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:42.926
(melancholy music)

01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:49.098
- Act as a sheep and
the wolf will eat you.

01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:15.492
(slow paced music)

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.771
- You're a man of little sleep.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:30.540
- It's all about
quality not quantity.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.643
It doesn't look like
you're getting much either.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.411
- Can I get you something sir?

01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:37.046
- No I'm fine thanks.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:38.014
- Sit.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.154
So.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.826
You've been screwing around
with a married woman.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:50.960
Classy.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.196
- First of all she's
no longer married.

01:13:53.296 --> 01:13:56.399
Second, she never ever puts out,

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.101
and with all due
respect I don't think

01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:00.604
you're a man that can be
giving lessons on integrity.

01:14:00.704 --> 01:14:02.939
- Nah ah ah, not
so fast bank man.

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:05.108
The one cheating
on his wife is you.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.943
- And the criminal is you.

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:09.813
- Business man, and
you're a partner in crime.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.681
If I remember correctly,
it was you who

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.483
opened up your bank
doors so we can

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.819
get some much needed funds.

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:18.488
So, seeing that you're
running out of time,

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:21.491
let's get the story straight.

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:23.192
Your girl has a husband.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.060
- An ex-husband.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.629
- Whatever.

01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:27.463
She tells him about the
security system in the bank.

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:29.398
When the cash arrives
he robs the bank.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.034
- Yeah I think so.

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:32.802
- You think so?!

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:35.539
- Well I'm not 100% sure but,

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:37.373
I just can't see
it any other way.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.709
- Then it could
have been anybody.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:40.944
- Yes.

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:43.279
What I need you to do
is go and visit the ex

01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:46.482
and persuade him
to turn himself in.

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:48.251
- For what?

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:49.619
- For robbing my bank.

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:51.655
- You just told me
you weren't 100% sure.

01:14:51.755 --> 01:14:53.723
- Does it matter?!

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.324
I mean does it matter
if I'm spot on or not?

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:56.826
That's what you're here for.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:00.564
To turn the uncertainties
into certainties.

01:15:01.765 --> 01:15:03.767
- I'm not gonna do it.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.938
- You're not gonna do it?

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:10.607
Why not?

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:13.176
- What you want me to just
knock on every persons door

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:15.679
who might have robbed
your bank in the city?

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:17.781
I don't work on guesstimates.

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:19.248
- Well if you don't do it,

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.585
if you don't it then I...

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.058
I can take you to the cops.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:30.927
- Excuse me?

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.596
- You heard me.

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:37.300
I can tell the cops who you
are and what you're about.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.668
- Is that so?

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:40.570
- Yes, because I know
who robbed my bank.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.840
I mean I think I know, but
it's more than I think.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.009
And I think it's time people
stop messing me around

01:15:46.109 --> 01:15:48.144
and started treating
me with some respect.

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:50.079
I put food on the tables
of a lot of families.

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:51.447
Yours included.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.817
I deserve a lot of credit.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.022
I mean think about it.

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:03.426
If he robbed my bank, then
he's got a lot of money on him.

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:04.794
Go and get him.

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:08.898
Then, I'll take you to a
proper fish restaurant.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:25.749
(slow paced music)

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:26.783
- [Jonta] Thank you.

01:16:26.883 --> 01:16:28.217
- [Giulia] My pleasure.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.619
- So why did you call?

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:31.755
I can see you're going
somewhere special today.

01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:34.390
- Oh no it was just you know,

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:35.725
with all this
bruising I just wanted

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:39.495
to wear something that
made me feel feminine.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.164
I know it's crazy.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:42.331
- Fair enough.

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:44.901
So, what happened?

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:50.206
- Well I was going down the
stairs heading to the spa

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.141
and this guy attacked me.

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:53.509
He didn't want my
money but he wanted

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.945
to talk to me about something.

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:59.716
Luckily the Landoni's across
were out spying as usual.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.585
And they must have scared
him away when he saw them.

01:17:02.686 --> 01:17:03.987
- Has anything gone on recently

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:05.689
which might have led
him to this incident?

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:07.991
- No, not really.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:09.759
- Oh, I'm gonna ask
you some questions

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:12.461
so I can better understand
this entire situation.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.529
- Okay.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:14.430
- Do you mind?

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.265
- No, no, not at all.

01:17:20.804 --> 01:17:23.439
- So what do you know
about Elio Sironi?

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:25.308
- Elio and I, we are,

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:28.845
I guess we are together.

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:30.313
- How long have
you been together?

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:33.850
- Ever since I started having
trouble with my husband.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.652
- And is this spa business
yours or his Mrs. Redondini?

01:17:36.753 --> 01:17:38.287
- Mine.

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.157
- Did he pay towards the
purchase of the business?

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.291
- Yes.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:43.426
- How much did he invest?

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:44.527
- Everything.

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:45.795
He bought it for me.

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:48.131
- Wow, that's a
big diamond ring.

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:50.533
And did he give you
any indication where
he got the money

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:53.002
to make that investment
Mrs. Redondini?

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:55.438
- No, but, he's a
banker so I just always

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:57.306
thought he made lots of money.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:00.609
- And do you own this apartment?

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:01.945
- Elio bought it.

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:03.379
And he said we would
live here together.

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:04.380
- But you don't.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.314
- No.

01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:07.917
He's still with his wife.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.787
- And you're aware that his
bank was robbed this week?

01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:14.323
- Yes and he thinks I tipped
my ex-husband to do it.

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:15.825
- Why your ex-husband?

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.460
- Because my ex-husband
came into the bank

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.830
the next day to pay his
overdue payments or whatever.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.665
But seriously, the guy
wouldn't go fishing

01:18:22.766 --> 01:18:25.101
because he thought
bait was cruel.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:29.272
He wouldn't hold up a
gun and much less a bank.

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:31.875
- Thank you Mrs. Redondini.

01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:33.242
- [Giulia] Thank you.

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:34.944
- I assure you we'll get
to the bottom of this.

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:37.613
In the meantime, if you
see anything suspicious,

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.082
call us immediately.

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:40.383
- [Giulia] Okay.

01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:46.189
Can I ask you a question?

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.590
- Of course.

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:48.892
- Am I safe?

01:18:48.992 --> 01:18:50.393
- Cooperate with
me Mrs. Redondini

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:53.062
and I promise you'll be safe.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:54.097
- Thank you.

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:08.111
I really appreciate that.

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.718
- Just out of curiosity,

01:19:15.819 --> 01:19:19.255
might you have any
idea who this could be?

01:19:20.723 --> 01:19:25.594
- [Giulia] Well that looks a
lot like my ex-husband Ruggero.

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:26.830
- Thank you.

01:19:27.897 --> 01:19:30.233
You have been very helpful.

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:37.473
(slow paced music)

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:10.473
(ringing)

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:16.913
- Hello.

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:19.548
- Mr. Sironi,
Sante Casoria here.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:20.984
- Yes, well.

01:20:21.084 --> 01:20:23.019
- Yes well indeed.

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:25.521
I've thought about
our meeting and

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:29.225
I think I will take you
up on the offer after all.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:33.362
- You made the right
decision Mr. Casoria.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.331
- Oh I don't doubt that.

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:39.202
How 'bout we meet at 3 am
at the city park and ride?

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:40.003
- 3 am?

01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:41.404
That's ridiculous.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:43.806
- If you wanna be sure
to find the guy at home

01:20:43.907 --> 01:20:45.975
there's no better
time than 3 am.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:48.211
- What the hell am I
gonna tell my wife?

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:50.346
- Isn't lying to your
wife your strong point?

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:53.482
Tell her whatever
the hell you want.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:54.850
Fucking idiot.

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:58.955
(ominous music)

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:20.743
- Right, ready to go?

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:22.878
- I'm always ready.

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:24.413
But before we head out,

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:26.349
could you just explain
to me one more time

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:28.751
why we're heading
to this guys house?

01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:30.253
- Are you serious?

01:21:30.353 --> 01:21:33.889
Mr. Casoria please
pay close attention.

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:37.126
Tonight, we are going
to visit Ruggero Lavati.

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:40.429
The ex-husband of
my ex side project.

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.198
Huh?

01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:44.233
Because I am almost 100% sure

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.535
that he's the man
that robbed my bank.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:50.473
We are simply going to get
him to turn himself in.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:54.978
And in a gentle manner
that only you can provide.

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:59.415
- So we're going to convince him

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.117
to turn himself in?

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:06.289
- Yeah we're going to convince
him to turn himself in.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.557
That way no one can claim
that I'm the one responsible

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:12.695
so I won't be forced to
tell the police a few things

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:15.431
that you're more than aware of.

01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:19.868
- Sounds good.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:21.837
Alright, get in the car.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.172
- You wanna take mine?

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:24.940
- You don't wanna
leave a car like this

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:27.977
in a place like this do you?

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:29.278
- Good point.

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:33.749
Speaking of which,

01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:37.086
why did you wanna
meet me here anyway?

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.597
What's wrong now?

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.466
- Just one more thing.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:52.901
How did you get out
of it with your wife?

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:54.803
- I came up with a
really good excuse.

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.505
I said the alarm on
my mobile to ring

01:22:56.605 --> 01:22:58.207
pretending it was
the police calling

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.576
to say that the alarm at
the bank was going off.

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:04.613
And I told her I had
to go in and disarm it.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:05.514
- Perfect.

01:23:08.884 --> 01:23:11.587
(loud gunshots)

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:22.165
Fucking idiot.

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:45.354
(ominous music)

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:26.195
(loud clanking)

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:29.465
(suspenseful music)

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:17.913
- Casoria.

01:25:18.013 --> 01:25:20.749
(loud gunshots)

01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:27.390
(rhythmic heartbeat)

01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:36.332
(slow paced music)

01:25:55.184 --> 01:25:57.886
(ominous music)

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:27.383
(solemn music)

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:57.646
I hate goodbyes, they
always made me cry.

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:00.215
So instead, I thought
I'd leave you this note

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:05.020
and the money I promised
you for a job well done.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.154
It'd be great to meet up again.

01:27:06.255 --> 01:27:08.324
My offer always stands.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.294
(loud horn)

01:27:11.394 --> 01:27:13.562
So all the best to
you and good luck.

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:16.499
Not like you need more of that.

01:27:23.038 --> 01:27:25.908
(engine chugging)

01:27:33.449 --> 01:27:36.319
(solemn music)

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:05.881
(faint whistling)

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:38.881
(ringing)

01:28:42.017 --> 01:28:42.951
- [Chief] Yeah.

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:45.788
- Salina, Gaetano Lolli here.

01:28:45.888 --> 01:28:47.322
- Gaetano?

01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:48.824
Something wrong?

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:50.325
- For you maybe.

01:28:50.426 --> 01:28:53.462
Had an old friend come
to pay me a visit.

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:55.531
Does the name Sante
Casoria ring a bell?

01:28:55.631 --> 01:28:56.965
- Where did you see him?

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.300
- At my place.

01:28:58.401 --> 01:28:59.968
- What the hell
is going on here?

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:01.303
- You tell me.

01:29:01.404 --> 01:29:02.671
This is an inside
job on your end.

01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:04.973
- There's no need to
make false accusations.

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.241
Just let me know where you are

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.576
and we'll come get you.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.912
- Maybe you should
go pick Casoria up.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:12.147
You don't need my testimony
against him anymore.

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:13.015
- [Chief] Did you kill him?

01:29:13.115 --> 01:29:14.349
- No I didn't kill him.

01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:16.419
He committed suicide
down my stairwell.

01:29:16.519 --> 01:29:18.521
- Alright, tell us where you are

01:29:18.621 --> 01:29:21.056
and we'll clear this mess up.

01:29:21.156 --> 01:29:23.626
- We will clear this mess
up the next time we meet.

01:29:23.726 --> 01:29:27.095
- Lolli you tell me
right this instant where.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.797
Lolli?

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:29.732
Lolli?

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:38.941
(upbeat music)

01:30:41.403 --> 01:30:42.605
- Thanks.

01:30:42.705 --> 01:30:45.874
(slow paced music)

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:03.886
(solemn music)

01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:26.609
Dear wolf, I'm
your sheep no more.

01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:28.210
Regards, Ruggero.

01:32:29.978 --> 01:32:34.216
P.S., I've known about you
and the banker all along.

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:53.268
(upbeat music)

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:04.546
(loud knocking)

01:33:04.647 --> 01:33:05.914
- [Chief] Yep.

01:33:07.249 --> 01:33:08.784
- Detective Jonta.

01:33:12.254 --> 01:33:13.055
- Hi detective.

01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:14.790
- Chief, thank you.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.327
- Why are you still working?

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.829
You should be on vacation.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:22.397
- I know Chief but I just can't

01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:24.532
get my head around this case.

01:33:24.633 --> 01:33:26.534
- You've been on the
force for how long now?

01:33:26.635 --> 01:33:28.336
- Going on 25 years.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:32.507
- Because you're a man of
integrity and experience,

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.442
I'll tell you something.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.244
But you can't
spread this around.

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.646
- Understood.

01:33:37.746 --> 01:33:39.782
- For the last two years
we've been investigating

01:33:39.882 --> 01:33:42.617
a large underground crime ring.

01:33:42.718 --> 01:33:46.288
Extortion, drug
dealing, robbing banks.

01:33:46.388 --> 01:33:47.322
Casoria.

01:33:47.422 --> 01:33:49.391
- The dead guy on the stairs?

01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:53.929
- The dead guy on the stairs
was involved in this ring.

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:56.665
And on Sunday
morning he showed up

01:33:56.765 --> 01:33:59.034
at the building where
one of our pry man,

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:02.705
our protected
informants was staying.

01:34:02.805 --> 01:34:05.207
Casoria got shot by our man.

01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:09.211
Was furious because he thinks
there's a rat on our end.

01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:11.980
The more I think about it,

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.383
the more I think
he might be right.

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.453
Casoria decides to
eliminate anyone

01:34:18.553 --> 01:34:21.156
who could know about
his activities.

01:34:21.256 --> 01:34:23.125
Starting with Sironi.

01:34:23.225 --> 01:34:25.327
- So he shoots
Sironi because he had

01:34:25.427 --> 01:34:29.064
his hands in the mix,
money laundering I suppose.

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.833
And he sees him as
the weakest link.

01:34:30.933 --> 01:34:32.735
- He would've ratted them out.

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:35.738
I hope this makes
things a little clearer.

01:34:35.838 --> 01:34:38.306
- So Chief, you
really think Sironi

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.608
asked the mob to rob
his bank three times?

01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:42.077
- Yes.

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:45.180
It's the only
logical explanation.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:52.387
- [Jonta] What about
Ruggero Levati?

01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:56.124
- Who's Ruggero Levati?

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.462
(upbeat music)

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:01.463
- [Narrator] Ladies
and gentlemen,

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:02.965
this is your captain speaking.

01:35:03.065 --> 01:35:05.968
We're about to start our
descent into Rio de Janeiro.

01:35:06.068 --> 01:35:09.471
The temperature is
a balmy 32 degrees

01:35:09.571 --> 01:35:11.539
or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:14.376
(loud coughing)

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:19.647
- You couldn't wait 30 minutes?

01:35:19.748 --> 01:35:20.983
- [Ruggero] I'm sorry.

01:35:21.083 --> 01:35:22.384
- 30 minutes, that was
a gift for our driver.

01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:24.820
- I know I'm sorry.

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.223
I just, awe man they're so good.

01:35:28.323 --> 01:35:31.159
Well, how many hours
we've been in the air now?

01:35:31.259 --> 01:35:32.460
- Too long.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.762
- I need some water.

01:35:33.862 --> 01:35:35.097
- Look at you.

01:35:35.197 --> 01:35:36.832
You're not gonna eat
the biscuits dry.

01:35:36.932 --> 01:35:40.135
- No just rob us
another bank if I do.

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:42.871
- Sooner or later you're gonna
run out of luck my friend.

01:35:42.971 --> 01:35:46.141
- Some call it luck
some call it destiny.

01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:48.376
- I heard you coughing sir,
do you need some water?

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:49.311
- Thanks.

01:35:52.014 --> 01:35:55.483
- Some would call it a
horseshoe up your ass.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.220
(upbeat music)

01:36:05.527 --> 01:36:08.396
(foreign singing)

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:44.726
- Girls take your bags
into the backseat,

01:37:44.826 --> 01:37:47.262
there's no room in the boot.

01:37:51.066 --> 01:37:53.401
- So they wanted a
logical explanation

01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:56.838
to support their own
flawed conclusions.

01:37:56.939 --> 01:38:00.608
