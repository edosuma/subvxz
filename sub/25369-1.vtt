09:49.130 --> 09:51.132
D‐Do you‐‐
Do you have music or‐‐

09:51.132 --> 09:52.759
I usually sing to music.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.553
Dad, this guy
might sing like an angel,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.180
but he don't hear too good.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.765
Uh, take him out back

09:58.765 --> 10:01.643
and pop some sense
into the pop star, boys.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.686
Wait! No, no, no, no, no.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.606
I could sing without music.
Sure. Uh, no problem.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.983
Hey! Hands off the megastar.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.485
Spider‐Man?

10:10.485 --> 10:13.655
Wow!
Ross Calaban knows my name?

10:13.655 --> 10:16.616
Wow. Spider‐Man knows my name?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.660
I'm a big fan.
I'm a big fan.

10:18.660 --> 10:22.705
Dad, the pajamaed mook
is ruining my birthday!

10:22.705 --> 10:25.208
Oh, no, he ain't.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.001
You're in my house now, see?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.294
Yow! What is‐‐ Ohh!

10:28.294 --> 10:29.879
What was that?
[muffled shouting]

10:29.879 --> 10:32.215
You're gonna turn yourself
in peacefully? Great!

10:32.215 --> 10:33.633
Whoa!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.093
Huh. [grunts]
Hey, hey.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.302
Hey‐‐ Ohh!

10:38.012 --> 10:40.014
You ruined my birthday!

10:40.014 --> 10:42.767
You're gonna sleep
with the fishes!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.727
Aw, come on, kiddo.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.272
That's not
a nice thing to say.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.691
And this ain't
a nice thing to do.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.652
[yells]
[grunts]

10:55.446 --> 10:57.824
[yelling]

10:57.824 --> 10:59.826
Aahh!

10:59.826 --> 11:01.661
Crazy monkey ninja boy!

11:01.661 --> 11:03.163
Crazy monkey ninja boy!

11:05.123 --> 11:07.417
Stand and fight, ya loser!

11:07.417 --> 11:09.169
I can't hit a seven‐year‐old.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.754
I just turned eight.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.881
[grunts]

11:12.881 --> 11:14.382
[yells]

11:14.382 --> 11:15.550
Kid, wait!

11:15.550 --> 11:18.011
Eh, what do you want,
ya crooner?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.554
To make a deal.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.722
Leave Spidey alone,

11:20.722 --> 11:22.849
and I'll take
a selfie with you.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.435
So? Everyone will think
it's fake.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.145
I'll post it myself.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.606
Your popularity
will go through the roof.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.024
All the other kids
will want you to be

11:31.024 --> 11:33.902
their third grade mob boss
or whatever.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.862
I like the sound of that.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.946
Deal.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.240
Wow.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.992
Saved by the power
of celebrity.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.870
Spidey, move.
You're gonna ruin my pic.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.167
<i>Formaggio.</i>

11:49.167 --> 11:50.126
[camera shutter clicks]

11:53.421 --> 11:56.049
You sure you don't
want to come backstage?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.885
Thanks, but I got friends
already inside waiting.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.638
Thank you, Spider‐Man.
I owe you.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.847
Break a leg.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.851
[man]
Ticket.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.936
I got it right, uh‐‐

12:07.936 --> 12:09.020
uh‐‐

12:09.020 --> 12:10.688
I had it.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.898
Where'd it go?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.191
Nice try, buddy.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.361
Gwen?

12:16.361 --> 12:17.737
Yeah, I'm finally here,

12:17.737 --> 12:21.199
but, uh, you were right.
I lost my ticket.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.076
Sorry.
We'll catch up later.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.957
[Ross]
Hello, New York!
Sorry I'm late.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.876
I'd like to dedicate
tonight's show
to a friend of mine‐‐

12:31.876 --> 12:33.294
Spider‐Man!

12:33.294 --> 12:34.879
"Friend"?

12:34.879 --> 12:38.091
<i>The</i> Ross Calaban
said I'm his friend?

12:38.091 --> 12:41.844
Yes! That makes me
almost cool.

<i>[Miles] They thought</i>

12:56.943 --> 13:00.154

<i>the Mummy of the Hills!</i>

13:01.823 --> 13:03.866
[boys screaming]

13:03.866 --> 13:05.994
So spooky!

13:05.994 --> 13:08.871
[giggling]
Miles, no offense,

13:08.871 --> 13:12.208
but you're absolutely
terrible at telling
campfire stories.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.252
Seriously.
And fact check‐‐

13:14.252 --> 13:17.463
mummies are from dry places
like Egyptian deserts,

13:17.463 --> 13:18.756
not lush forests.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.842
Ha! I know, right?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.260
So unexpected.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.929
That's why it's so spooky.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.097
Right, Peter?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.893
Uh, right. Spooky.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.854
Or not spooky.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.063
What were we talking about?

13:34.063 --> 13:37.567
Huh. See?
I scared him senseless.

13:37.567 --> 13:41.362
[Gwen] You okay, Pete?
You're a million miles away.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.864
I'm sorry. It's just‐‐

13:42.864 --> 13:44.490
You know I made that

13:44.490 --> 13:47.118
Perfect Summer Vacation
checklist?

13:47.118 --> 13:49.454
But nothing's
really worked out.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.913
Now the summer's
almost over,

13:50.913 --> 13:52.498
and I've checked off
next to nothing.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.084
Camping was on the list,
right? And we're here.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.337
Even if we have to listen
to Miles' awful ghost stories,

13:58.337 --> 13:59.881
don't quit on us, Parker.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.424
There's still time
to have a great summer.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.010
Yeah. Maybe.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.845
Or maybe not,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.638
if ghosts get us.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.807
Ghosts don't
exist, Miles.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.727
Oh, yeah? I've never
heard a ghost say that.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.021
Seriously, this area's
supposed to be haunted.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.231
My cousin heard it
from his friend's aunt,

14:17.231 --> 14:20.068
so it's the real deal.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.819
It all started

14:21.819 --> 14:25.573
with a shadowy form
flying through the treetops.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.866
Then‐‐

14:26.866 --> 14:28.201
[groans]
I'm headed for bed

14:28.201 --> 14:29.869
before Miles
gets going again.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.412
Good night, everyone.
Night, guys.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.873
I'll clean up. I wouldn't
want you out in the open

14:33.873 --> 14:36.042
in case any ghosts
or mummies come by.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.586
I know you're kidding,

14:38.586 --> 14:40.213
but good point.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.008
Anya? Gwen?

14:44.008 --> 14:45.635
Is that you?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.680
Hey! Our stuff!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.140
Huh?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.522
[grunts]
Come out, come out,
whatever you are.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.524
If you're the Mummy
of the Hills,

14:59.524 --> 15:02.485
you should know
that you're supposed to
be in a drier climate.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.028
Huh? Whoa!

15:04.028 --> 15:08.324
Okay, what are you,
the ghost of a tree trimmer?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.368

15:10.368 --> 15:13.037

15:26.592 --> 15:27.885
[screeches]

15:27.885 --> 15:30.388
[grunts]
Did you just peck at me?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.890
I don't give a hoot
who you are.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.933
That's just rude.

15:36.394 --> 15:39.105
Aah! Super creepy!

15:40.982 --> 15:43.943
[grunting] Oh, man,
oh, man, oh, man!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.027
Are you gonna drink my blood?

15:45.027 --> 15:48.072
What? Why would I
do that? Weird.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.032
That's what spiders
do, right?

15:50.032 --> 15:52.034
To things
caught in their webs?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.328
I don't carry
the theme that far.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.164
Why were you
stealing that stuff?

15:56.164 --> 15:59.041
I'm starving, man.
I need food.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.086
Food? Don't owls
just eat rodents?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.796
I don't carry the theme
that far.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.258
Touché. So, have you been
out here for long?

16:07.258 --> 16:08.885
No.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.970
But I've had to hide
in these hills for weeks.

16:10.970 --> 16:15.016
Ever since a lab accident
made me into this owl dude,

16:15.016 --> 16:18.186
my parents, my friends‐‐
they all ran me out.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.604
They think I'm a monster.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.648
Lab accidents are one
of my pet peeves, too.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.358
It's how I got my powers.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.444
Really? A lab accident

16:26.444 --> 16:28.529
turned you
into a sick spider freak?

16:28.529 --> 16:32.533
I prefer the term
"awesome spider
cool guy," but yeah.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.244
Then why are you not
out here like me‐‐

16:35.244 --> 16:40.166
hated, living in the trees,
and stealing food to survive?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.001
I‐‐ I've always
had people around me

16:42.001 --> 16:44.420
who accepted me
for who I am, I guess,

16:44.420 --> 16:46.714
whether I'm a science geek
or a superhero.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.090
You're one lucky dude.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.052
Yeah. I guess I am.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.845
I'm sorry you feel
you have to hide,

16:52.845 --> 16:55.097
but I know there are
good people out there

16:55.097 --> 16:57.308
who would help. In fact,

16:57.308 --> 16:59.560
there's some people
in that camp you should meet.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.648
[animal howling]

17:07.860 --> 17:09.403
Nocturnal, wait!

17:09.403 --> 17:10.780
My own parents kicked me out,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.907
and you want me
to trust strangers?

17:12.907 --> 17:14.367
I'm not ready, man.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.286
Maybe someday.
Someday soon, I hope.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.872
Here.
I stole this from them.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.000
No. They'd want you
to keep it.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.460
They're pretty great
like that.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.219
What's all this? Breakfast?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.137
Yep. Hope that's okay.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.182
I don't know.
Will it somehow ruin
the camping trip?

17:38.182 --> 17:41.185
[chuckles] Sorry I was
such a downer last night.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.230
I was so obsessed
about not living up
to my perfect summer,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.524
I didn't realize
I was already having it‐‐

17:46.524 --> 17:48.067
spending time with you guys.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.819
That's what really matters,
right?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.153
Of course, Pete.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.155
You're really important
to us, too.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.825
Besides, any apology
said with food

17:55.825 --> 17:57.743
is an apology
I can accept.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.120
Oh. You know the story

17:59.120 --> 18:00.496
about the guy
with the hook?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.957
Oh, no, wait.
That's the ending.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.500
Uch! Let me start over.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.502
[laughter]

18:11.465 --> 18:14.093
One week of summer left.
Let's see how I'm doing

18:14.093 --> 18:17.138
on the whole Perfect
Summer Vacation checklist.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.056
Trip to the beach,

18:19.056 --> 18:21.976
which I had to abandon
'cause of Black Cat.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.021
Baseball game‐‐
ruined by the Tinkerer.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.231
Concert. I missed
that whole show,

18:27.231 --> 18:28.399
thanks to Hammerhead,

18:28.399 --> 18:30.943
but I did get to meet
Ross Calaban,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.737
so I'm calling that even.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.405
And camping. Total win,

18:34.405 --> 18:36.574
despite the mysterious
owl boy.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.619
So, that's one win,
two losses, and a tie.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.121
[sighs] Good thing
school's starting soon

18:42.121 --> 18:43.581
'cause winning
at summer vacation

18:43.581 --> 18:46.208
is a lot harder
than I realized.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.586
[phone beeping]
Whoa. Guess I missed
some messages

18:48.586 --> 18:50.171
when I was out
of range camping.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.006
<i>Peter. Max Modell here.</i>

18:52.006 --> 18:54.842
<i>Was hoping to schedule time</i>
<i>for you to come in</i>

18:54.842 --> 18:57.553
<i>and train your replacement</i>
<i>as my lab assistant.</i>

18:57.553 --> 18:59.180
"Replacement"?

19:00.640 --> 19:04.226
Yeah. The board only
authorizes that position

19:04.226 --> 19:05.311
for first‐year students.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.189
I assumed
you knew that, Peter.

19:08.189 --> 19:12.151
Of course.
I totally knew that.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.362
Of course I totally
<i>didn't</i> know that.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.198
Uhh! How am I going to afford
Horizon this year?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.164
I can't ask Aunt May
or Harry for money.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.166
They've already
done enough for me.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.959
This is on you, Peter.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.252
[slurping]

19:30.252 --> 19:31.504
You're a smart kid.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.340
You'll find a part‐time job
with no problem.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.342
Hi. My name's Peter Parker.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.094
And if you'll
look at my résumé,

19:38.094 --> 19:39.845
you'll see that‐‐
[explosion]

19:39.845 --> 19:42.139
y‐you‐‐ you'll see that I'm
e‐experienced in, uh‐‐

19:42.139 --> 19:44.266
[police officer]
Freeze, Scorpion!
I'm so sorry. I, uh‐‐

19:44.266 --> 19:46.268
My aunt's calling.
I gotta take this.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.403
[grunts]
Sorry about that.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.613
There was a pest problem
I had to take care of.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.783
[man]
I'm sorry, but we just
filled the position.

20:00.783 --> 20:04.203
Oh, this? Uh, it's just
a little sand‐based accident

20:04.203 --> 20:06.539
on the way here.
It's no big deal, really.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.166
Uhh...

20:09.166 --> 20:11.293
Goo? What goo?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.170
Oh, man!

20:13.170 --> 20:15.172
I've had a long morning.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.549
[muffled yell]

20:16.549 --> 20:19.135
[pants] What's this?

20:19.135 --> 20:21.554
Oh, I have to give this
back to the police.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.764
I mean, not the police.
Why would I even say that?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.349
I mean, for charity.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.727
Parking meters.
Parking meter charity.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.939
Wow. Being Spider‐Man
really puts a crimp

20:31.939 --> 20:33.399
in a person's job hunt.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.444
Hey, Pete.
Long time, no see.

20:36.444 --> 20:39.155
Randy Robertson?
How have you been?

20:39.155 --> 20:41.282
I've been having
the perfect summer vacation.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.742
What have you been up to?

20:42.742 --> 20:46.245
[chuckles] Interviewing
for part‐time jobs, Randy,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.329
and having zero luck.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.540
Well, my dad works
at that media company,

20:49.540 --> 20:50.624
the Daily Bugle.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.420
They're expanding,
doing a lot of hiring.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.338
Want me to see if I can
get you an interview?

20:56.338 --> 20:57.757
A job?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.800
Listen, Peter Palmer‐‐

20:59.800 --> 21:01.385
Peter Parker.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.137
The Daily Bugle's
a top‐tier

21:03.137 --> 21:04.889
multi‐platform
news organization.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.308
Call me back when you
can grow facial hair.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.227
Brock, this is the footage
I've been waiting on?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.937
I thought you were a pro!

21:11.937 --> 21:13.773
I can't use this!

21:13.773 --> 21:16.400
My grandma could take
better video of Spider‐Man,

21:16.400 --> 21:19.320
and she's not even
alive anymore!

21:19.320 --> 21:20.571
I'd pay through the roof

21:20.571 --> 21:23.282
if anyone could get me
some good clean footage

21:23.282 --> 21:25.201
of this Spider‐Man!

21:25.201 --> 21:27.328
Paying for shots
of Spider‐Man?

21:27.328 --> 21:31.373
Hmm. Maybe I'm gonna be
able to afford school
this year after all.
