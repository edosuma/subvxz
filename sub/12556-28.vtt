00:51.343 --> 00:54.301
A METEOR OR SOMETHING, PROBABLY.
I BETTER CHECK IN.

00:54.388 --> 00:58.177
THAT VVOMAN VVHO PHONED SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT CALLING OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD.

NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
SOMETHING LEFT THAT POND

02:15.969 --> 02:17.835

04:04.202 --> 04:07.115
THAT'S ROUGH. CAN'T
TURN AROUND AND GO BACK.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.118
THERE'S A SLIDE UP AT THE TURNOFF.
BLOCKED THE VVHOLE ROAD.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.165

04:32.564 --> 04:35.181
GET COMFORTABLE AND GET
A LITTLE HOT FOOD IN YOU.

04:35.275 --> 04:40.691

FOR MISSING MY MEETING IN BOSTON.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.773
THAT'S A FINE LITTLE BUS LINE

04:43.825 --> 04:46.487
THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT

04:46.578 --> 04:49.161

IN HERE BEFORE THE BUS STOPPED?

06:21.631 --> 06:24.623
NO, I HAVEN'T SERVED ANYBODY

06:24.718 --> 06:26.880
I FIGURED THIS WHOLE
BUNCH GOT OFF THE BUS.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.758
WE DID. THERE WAS NO ONE
IN HERE WHEN WE CAME IN.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.466
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT
FOR SEVEN PEOPLE?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.642
THAT ONE BEATS ME.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.229
ONE OF THEM DIDN'T
GET OFF THE BUS.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.401

WASN'T ON THE BUS?

06:44.487 --> 06:46.819
WE WERE ALL

07:00.003 --> 07:03.291
I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING YOU ON THE BUS.

07:03.381 --> 07:07.420
THAT'S QUITE FUNNY 'CAUSE I DON'T
REMEMBER SEEING YOU, NEITHER.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.631
MAKES ONE OF US
A LIAR, DON'T IT?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.338
THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.

<i>OR WHETHER THERE WERE SIX OR
SEVEN OR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY?</i>

07:18.271 --> 07:20.854

07:29.950 --> 07:33.363
FLYING OVER HERE? NO, I
HA\/EN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.660
WE GOT A CALL
ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.785
A VVOMAN SAID SHE HEARD SOMETHING
FLY OVER AND THEN COME DOVVN.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.287
FLY OVER HERE?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.293
FROM WHERE?

07:43.380 --> 07:47.544
<i>FROM UP THERE. AN
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:51.127

NOTHING'S COME DOWN FROM
UP THERE EXCEPT SNOW.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.178
<i>THAT'S ALL I'VE SEEN FOR
THE PAST 14 HOURS. SNOW.</i>

07:57.268 --> 07:59.430
<i>WHERE DID SHE SAY
IT CAME DOWN?</i>

07:59.521 --> 08:03.640
<i>CLOSE TO HERE. LOOK, SOMETHING
DID LAND IN TRACY'S POND.</i>

08:03.692 --> 08:06.559
LEFT A TRAIL OF BROKEN
BRANCHES BEFORE IT HIT.

WE FOUND TRACKS
LEADING AWAY FROM IT.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.991
TO WHERE?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.148
TO HERE.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.531
YOU MEAN SOMETHING LANDED IN TRACY'S
POND AND THEN CAME IN HERE?

08:16.621 --> 08:21.411
THAT'S CRAZY. NOTHING'S COME IN HERE SINCE
11:00 THIS MORNING. NOTHING, EXCEPT--

08:21.501 --> 08:25.586
<i>EXCEPT ME AND MY PASSENGERS.
ME AND SIX PEOPLE.</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:30.087
THAT MEANS THAT
ONE PERSON HERE--

08:34.014 --> 08:36.221

LIKE THIS.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.765
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL US THAT
THERE'S ONE PERSON IN HERE

08:42.856 --> 08:46.269
VVHO LANDED IN SOME KIND OF A SAUOER
OR SOMETHING AND THEN CAME IN HERE?

08:46.359 --> 08:49.852
CAME IN HERE WITH US?

08:49.946 --> 08:53.359
VVELL, THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.
VVE'D HA\/E SEEN THEM.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.863
<i>NOT NECESSARILY.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.116

EYES CLOSED TO GET OUT OF THE SNOVV.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.073
ANYONE COULD HA\/E COME IN VVITH
US AND VVE WOULDN'T HA\/E NOTICED.

VVHO DOESN'T BELONG HERE, YOU,

09:51.091 --> 09:52.502
YOU ELIMINATE
THE COUPLES.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.005

L-I COULD HA\/E SVVORN YOU

10:11.444 --> 10:16.359
A MOLE ON MY CHIN? CONNIE, I'\/E
NEVER HAD A MOLE ON MY OHIN.

10:16.449 --> 10:20.283
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
VVE'RE ALL GOING TO GET SO PANIOKY

10:20.370 --> 10:24.159
THAT EVERYONE VVILL START PICKING UP
INVISIBLE CLUES FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.456
THIS IS NONSENSE.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.207
OF COURSE IT'S NONSENSE IF A HUSBAND

10:30.296 --> 10:34.335
VVHETHER THE HUSBAND IS REALLY THE
HUSBAND AND THE VVIFE IS REALLY--

10:34.425 --> 10:37.838
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

10:37.929 --> 10:41.968
I THINK 23 YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH FOR A

11:09.502 --> 11:12.164
GO BACK THERE
AND LOCK IT.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.589
IT'S ALREADY LOCKED. IF THAT CERTAIN

BELT YOU, GRANDPA.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.618
SHE WAS ON THE BUS.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.993
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.497
SHE'S THE ONLY
ONE I NOTICED.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.294
WELL, THANK YOU.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.748
BUT WHO NOTICED HIM?

12:43.096 --> 12:46.464
HOVV DO VVE KNOVV YOU'RE THE
SAME ONE DRIVING THE BUS, HUH?

12:46.557 --> 12:49.265
AIN'T NOBODY BEEN EXONERATED, YET.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.639
LOOK, LET'S CUT THIS
FARCE OUT RIGHT NOW.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.437
VVE'LL ALL SHOVV OUR IDENTIFICATIONS
AND PUT A STOP TO IT.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.189
THE WHOLE
THING'S RIDICULOUS.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.018
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE EXTRA PERSON IN HERE?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.194
YES, HOW ABOUT THAT?

13:02.949 --> 13:05.941
VERY SIMPLE.
THE DRIVER'S MISTAKEN.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.824
SE\/EN PEOPLE GOT ON THE BUS AND
HE THOUGHT THERE VVERE ONLY SIX.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.289
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

13:13.376 --> 13:17.540
NOT A CHANCE IN THE VVORLD. I
COUNTED HEADS BEFORE VVE TOOK OFF.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.837
THERE WERE SIX PEOPLE.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.386

14:36.667 --> 14:38.704
THAT WASN'T YOUR
GAG, WAS IT?

14:38.795 --> 14:41.753
I MEAN, THE BUSINESS ABOUT THE
JUKEBOX STARTING LIKE THAT?

14:41.839 --> 14:45.127
NOT ME. I'M STRICTLY SHORT
ORDERS AND PAY YOUR TAXES.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.960
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SCIENCE FICTION.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.922
A JUKEBOX IS A JUKEBOX, AND IF THAT THING
VVANTS TO START UP ALL ON ITS OVVN,

14:52.016 --> 14:54.883
YOU'LL CHECK WITH AN
ELECTRICAL ENGINEER.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.560
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER.
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER!

15:16.290 --> 15:17.621
FIND ANYTHING?

15:17.708 --> 15:20.325
NO. TOOK A LOOK
AT THE BRIDGE.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.460
<i>I KNOW THAT BRIDGE. WHAT'S
MORE, I DON'T TRUST IT.</i>

15:25.550 --> 15:30.135
VVELL, THANK GOODNESS VVE NEEDN'T
CONCERN OURSELVES VVITH YOUR JUDGMENT.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.964
IF THE BRIDGE GETS A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH,
YOU'LL DRI\/E THAT BUS RIGHT ACROSS IT.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.800
LISTEN, MISTER, YOU MAY
BE A BIG SHOT IN BOSTON,

15:36.894 --> 15:39.852

15:50.199 --> 15:51.985
WHY DID THE LIGHTS
GO OUT LIKE THAT?

15:52.076 --> 15:55.034
WE MAY BE LOSING POWER.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.389
WHY DON'T THEY
DO SOMETHING?

16:17.477 --> 16:22.017
VVHAT'S THE POINT OF US ALL STAYING
COOPED UP IN HERE LIKE THIS AND-AND NOT--

16:22.106 --> 16:27.522
THE POINT IS THIS. VVE'RE ALL KIDS IN A CLOSET
HERE. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS VVHAT'S GOING ON.

16:27.612 --> 16:32.231
IF THERE VVAS SOME KIND OFA SAUCER THAT
LANDED IN THAT POND AND HE DID COMEIN HERE,

16:32.325 --> 16:35.317
IT VVOULD BE A HEALTHY IDEA IF VVE
PINPOINTED THAT PARTICULAR SOMEBODY

16:35.411 --> 16:37.903
AND KEPT HIM
FROM LEAVING.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.329

IT IS IS IN\/ISIBLE.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.703
MAYBE THEY'RE PLAYING AROUND.
CAT AND MOUSE.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.535
THAT IS CHILDISH NONSENSE.

16:45.630 --> 16:49.419
IT'S AS GOOD AN EXPLANATION
AS ANY I'\/E HEARD.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.002
<i>BUT WHAT IF THE-THE THING
DOESN'T SHOW ITSELF?</i>

16:53.054 --> 16:55.170
DO WE JUST SIT HERE
HOLDING OUR BREATH?

16:55.223 --> 16:56.679
YES. HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.928
WELL, IF SOMEBODY
WAS TO ASK ME--

16:59.018 --> 17:02.261
VVELL, NO ONE DID ASK
YOU, AND NO ONE VVILL.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.892
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE
THE OLD MAN ALONE.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.893
WHO INVITED
YOU INTO THIS?

17:06.983 --> 17:09.851
VVELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE VVE
VVERE VVAITING FOR INVITATIONS,

17:09.945 --> 17:13.358
BUT YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG THING
ABOUT BOSSING EVERYBODY AROUND.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.737

17:58.828 --> 18:00.364

18:01.914 --> 18:04.656

18:08.754 --> 18:10.461
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, PERRY?

18:10.548 --> 18:12.334
WE CAN'T HOLD THEM.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.292
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE, OFFICER.
BIG MISTAKE.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.968
YOU'RE LETTING
A MONSTER OUT.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.012
THAT MAY WELL BE,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.606
I DON'T LIKE
THAT SUCKER.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.151
SHE SVVINGS IN THE VVIND AND
SHE'S NOT A SUSPENSION.

THAT BRIDGE WASN'T SAFE.

20:24.890 --> 20:30.385
IT COLLAPSED. THE STATE POLICE

KERPLUNK, RIGHT
INTO THE RIVER.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.645

SCENE. NO ONE GOT OUT.
