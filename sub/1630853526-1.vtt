(logo whooshing)

00:20.561 --> 00:23.970
(woman screaming)

00:24.006 --> 00:26.615
(eerie music)

00:36.183 --> 00:39.348
(tense upbeat music)

01:32.545 --> 01:33.380
(woman screams)

01:33.415 --> 01:35.572
(car crashes)

01:35.641 --> 01:38.912
(tense upbeat music)

01:40.547 --> 01:43.296
(gentle music)

02:18.540 --> 02:19.374
- Hello?

02:28.978 --> 02:29.812
Hello?

02:32.143 --> 02:32.979
Hello?

02:41.571 --> 02:44.320
(Rose pants)

02:44.356 --> 02:45.190
Hello?

02:49.887 --> 02:52.462
(Rose grunts)

02:57.576 --> 03:00.046
(Rose cries)

03:01.229 --> 03:04.534
(gentle somber music)

03:11.632 --> 03:12.467
- Rose

03:19.321 --> 03:21.408
Rose you are awake.

03:21.408 --> 03:22.243
- What's going on?

03:22.278 --> 03:23.983
- Just take a moment.

03:24.018 --> 03:26.662
Really try to keep calm.

03:26.662 --> 03:28.123
- Please. - It's it's okay.

03:29.201 --> 03:30.106
- What's going on?

03:31.115 --> 03:31.950
- And what--

03:34.594 --> 03:35.847
I don't know where I am.

03:37.795 --> 03:39.535
I don't know-- - It's okay.

03:39.570 --> 03:41.658
It's okay, really?

03:41.726 --> 03:42.632
- Help me, please.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.284
I don't know what's going on.

03:49.972 --> 03:50.807
Who am I?

03:54.634 --> 03:55.469
- Rose.

03:56.409 --> 03:59.157
(gentle music)

04:04.585 --> 04:05.454
- You're a doctor?

04:07.195 --> 04:11.126
- Your name is Rose Anne Baker.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.596
- Rose Anne Baker.

04:13.596 --> 04:15.927
- Baker from your father's side, obviously.

04:15.962 --> 04:19.302
Anne is your grandmother's name from the Hebrew for Hannah.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.328
It means grace or God has favored me.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.495
Would you like a cup of tea?

04:27.095 --> 04:28.104
(loud thud)

04:28.138 --> 04:29.288
What?

04:29.288 --> 04:30.748
- What was that?

04:30.818 --> 04:34.262
- Oh, that's next door boy, he loves football.

04:34.262 --> 04:37.045
He's always playing football.

04:37.115 --> 04:39.725
Would you like me to ask him to stop?

04:39.725 --> 04:41.951
- No.

04:41.986 --> 04:43.656
No, it's fine.

04:43.656 --> 04:48.562
- So do you remember anything, anything at all?

04:48.562 --> 04:49.849
- I don't know.

04:49.919 --> 04:51.275
Bits here, bits there.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.128
It feels like--

04:56.077 --> 04:56.912
- What?

04:58.443 --> 05:01.574
- Have you ever had a feeling like you've been somewhere,

05:01.574 --> 05:03.418
like a memory of a place

05:03.418 --> 05:08.079
and you're not sure if you really went or just dreamed it,

05:08.149 --> 05:12.150
real but not real, perhaps a bit of both.

05:12.186 --> 05:16.256
- I think we all feel like that from time to time.

05:16.256 --> 05:19.561
I always say memories are like the mirrors

05:19.561 --> 05:22.066
that we remember things through.

05:22.066 --> 05:24.989
- My legs, what happened?

05:25.023 --> 05:28.155
- You were coming to see me and your father.

05:28.189 --> 05:31.320
It was dark and it was raining.

05:31.356 --> 05:33.652
I didn't want you to come, but you insisted.

05:35.078 --> 05:36.331
- I had an accident.

05:36.365 --> 05:37.757
- Yes.

05:37.791 --> 05:39.706
Rather a serious one.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.862
You were airlifted to the hospital.

05:44.751 --> 05:45.864
Let's talk about this another time.

05:45.933 --> 05:47.185
- No, please.

05:47.185 --> 05:48.577
- You need to rest. - Please,

05:48.577 --> 05:50.316
I just wanna know what happened.

05:52.161 --> 05:55.571
- They put you in an induced coma for six weeks.

05:56.510 --> 05:57.658
- And then I came home.

05:57.693 --> 06:00.198
- Yes. Yesterday afternoon.

06:00.198 --> 06:03.364
I had suspected that there may be memory problems

06:03.398 --> 06:05.277
so I took the decision for you

06:05.277 --> 06:09.244
to spend the duration of your recovery here at home,

06:09.278 --> 06:11.575
familiar surroundings and all that.

06:12.619 --> 06:14.114
- I don't remember this room.

06:14.150 --> 06:15.923
- You will, you will, I promise.

06:17.037 --> 06:18.882
Now how about that tea?

06:19.751 --> 06:20.585
- Yes.

06:21.734 --> 06:23.057
That would be nice.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.421
- How do you take it. - Milk and two sugars.

06:27.092 --> 06:29.249
Wait, how did I remember that?

06:29.284 --> 06:31.789
- I suppose it's what you could call progress.

06:31.789 --> 06:33.354
- You did that on purpose, didn't you?

06:33.389 --> 06:35.059
- I don't know what you mean.

06:35.059 --> 06:36.486
(Doreen chuckles)

06:36.486 --> 06:38.990
Now I, how about that tea?

06:39.026 --> 06:41.183
Milk, two sugars. - Please.

06:43.026 --> 06:44.697
Wait. - Yes, dear.

06:46.332 --> 06:48.454
- What if tonight I go to sleep and--

06:48.489 --> 06:50.159
- And what?

06:50.159 --> 06:50.994
- I forget.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.169
What if I forget everything that happened today?

06:55.203 --> 06:59.901
- Mother will help you remember, always.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.545
Back in a jiffy.

07:02.545 --> 07:05.294
(gentle music)

07:15.000 --> 07:17.853
So I phoned the hospital

07:17.853 --> 07:20.602
and I've arranged for you to have a scan on Thursday.

07:20.636 --> 07:22.306
- Okay.

07:22.306 --> 07:23.420
- Can't you finish?

07:23.489 --> 07:24.672
- No, no, I'm sorry.

07:24.672 --> 07:26.516
- It's fine. It's fine.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.338
- What's that for? - It's for the pain.

07:41.372 --> 07:42.764
- I'm not in any pain.

07:42.764 --> 07:44.329
- That's because of this silly.

07:45.756 --> 07:46.834
Come on, arm.

07:50.001 --> 07:53.097
Now, you're just going to feel a little scratch.

07:57.968 --> 07:59.255
There, that's better.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.725
Hold that.

08:03.430 --> 08:05.727
Now you need to rest up.

08:05.761 --> 08:07.849
- Easier said than done, my head is all over the place.

08:07.883 --> 08:10.353
- Oh, I know how you feel.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.025
I know it's been awful, what's happened,

08:16.059 --> 08:19.226
but it's so good to have your home.

08:22.496 --> 08:24.340
Night night Poppet.

08:24.340 --> 08:25.176
- Night.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.248
(gentle tense music)

09:22.686 --> 09:23.520
Mom.

09:32.149 --> 09:33.575
Hello?

09:33.611 --> 09:36.185
(eerie music)

09:41.230 --> 09:43.143
Is somebody there?

09:43.213 --> 09:45.787
(eerie music)

09:50.832 --> 09:51.876
Jesus, fuck!

09:54.381 --> 09:55.808
Mom?

09:55.808 --> 09:58.382
(eerie music)

10:13.934 --> 10:16.022
- Rise and shine Poppet.

10:17.727 --> 10:20.754
How about some breakfast and a nice hot bath?

10:20.788 --> 10:21.727
- That sounds good.

10:22.701 --> 10:24.580
Mom? - Yes, dear.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.407
- What was that about last night.

10:28.407 --> 10:29.938
- Excuse me.

10:30.008 --> 10:33.000
- Last night, when you were sat on the end of the bed.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.052
Last night.

10:37.244 --> 10:38.219
- Oh, Rose,

10:38.219 --> 10:40.549
it's so good to have you back,

10:40.585 --> 10:43.298
we've missed you so much.

10:43.298 --> 10:45.038
Back in a jiffy.

10:45.107 --> 10:45.942
- Okay.

10:51.961 --> 10:54.884
(water sloshing)

10:59.511 --> 11:00.625
- Coming in.

11:01.877 --> 11:03.547
- Yeah, come in.

11:03.582 --> 11:05.391
- I brought you some fresh towels.

11:07.444 --> 11:09.079
How was your breakfast?

11:09.983 --> 11:11.445
- Nice.

11:11.445 --> 11:13.114
It was nice, thank you.

11:13.150 --> 11:13.985
- Good.

11:17.255 --> 11:18.716
What is it, dear?

11:20.178 --> 11:23.379
- How can I remember how I like my tea and not remember?

11:23.413 --> 11:26.440
- Well that's semantic memory.

11:26.475 --> 11:30.337
You are suffering from what they call retrograde amnesia

11:30.337 --> 11:32.598
and that affects your episodic memories.

11:33.816 --> 11:37.052
Semantic memories deal with things

11:37.121 --> 11:39.452
like memories of general knowledge.

11:39.486 --> 11:42.201
For example, I take it you know what fruit is?

11:43.140 --> 11:45.645
Whereas episodic memory

11:45.645 --> 11:48.811
deals with your memories of past events.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.116
And as you've got retrograde amnesia,

11:52.116 --> 11:55.908
unfortunately all the events leading up to the accident

11:55.944 --> 11:57.823
will be in accessible to you.

11:59.075 --> 12:01.336
- How long will it take to recover?

12:01.336 --> 12:03.389
- Full memory recovery,

12:04.294 --> 12:05.546
it will take time.

12:06.972 --> 12:08.433
I think we'll have a clearer picture

12:08.433 --> 12:10.486
when they've done some follow up tests.

12:14.766 --> 12:17.340
You've had a very serious knock to the head,

12:17.410 --> 12:19.776
it's going to take time

12:19.776 --> 12:23.394
and you need to be patient and trust me.

12:23.428 --> 12:25.203
- How long?

12:25.238 --> 12:28.683
- It could be weeks, it could be months.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.632
Do you remember anything about the accident?

12:37.764 --> 12:38.598
Rose?

12:40.964 --> 12:41.973
- It was dark.

12:43.155 --> 12:46.287
- Yes, it was evening when you came here.

12:47.609 --> 12:51.018
- I don't know, it was raining, I was upset.

12:51.018 --> 12:51.958
- What else?

12:55.646 --> 12:58.777
- Nothing. There's nothing. - Come on, Rose, try.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.526
- I am, it's just, I just--

13:02.535 --> 13:04.274
- Rose,

13:04.274 --> 13:06.814
don't just lie there wallowing in self pity,

13:06.849 --> 13:08.798
feeling sorry for yourself.

13:08.832 --> 13:13.251
- I'm not, it's just that-- - Oh, I'm sorry.

13:13.285 --> 13:15.129
- It's just-- - What?

13:18.747 --> 13:20.279
- I don't-- - Yes.

13:25.636 --> 13:27.480
- I don't remember you.

13:30.681 --> 13:31.516
- There.

13:34.891 --> 13:38.474
Well, as I said, it's going to take time.

13:39.901 --> 13:42.476
Call me when you want to get out.

13:58.828 --> 14:00.707
(water sloshing)

14:00.707 --> 14:01.681
Rose!

14:01.715 --> 14:04.221
Rose, it's okay, it's okay.

14:04.221 --> 14:07.769
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have left you alone.

14:07.804 --> 14:12.188
Oh my God, thank goodness I got here on time.

14:12.223 --> 14:13.927
Oh, Rosey-wosey-woo,

14:14.832 --> 14:16.502
what would you do without mommy?

14:18.381 --> 14:20.990
(eerie music)

14:35.255 --> 14:37.621
(door thuds)

14:38.873 --> 14:40.334
Here we are.

14:40.334 --> 14:41.378
- Where's my father.

14:42.317 --> 14:44.335
- Oh your dad.

14:44.335 --> 14:46.632
He's a lovely old man.

14:48.824 --> 14:50.285
He's not himself anymore.

14:51.711 --> 14:53.381
- What about my friends?

14:53.416 --> 14:54.251
- Friends?

14:54.285 --> 14:55.191
- Yeah.

14:55.225 --> 14:57.278
Have I got a phone?

14:57.278 --> 14:58.739
- A phone?

14:58.774 --> 15:00.722
- I must have had one, a mobile phone.

15:02.218 --> 15:05.350
- There wasn't one in the belongings that I was given.

15:05.384 --> 15:07.680
Perhaps it was lost or damaged in the accident.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.638
- Maybe. I just thought if I had a mobile phone,

15:10.707 --> 15:13.004
I could contact my friend if they tried to call,

15:13.039 --> 15:15.613
or, have you told them, do they know where I am?

15:15.613 --> 15:20.832
- Yes, but they're all very eager to come and see you but--

15:26.259 --> 15:29.495
Rose you've been in a very serious accident,

15:29.495 --> 15:33.183
you have so much to process, too much.

15:33.218 --> 15:35.306
I can't have you inundated.

15:36.732 --> 15:39.376
Besides with Jamie coming tomorrow.

15:39.376 --> 15:41.046
- What?

15:41.046 --> 15:41.881
Who, who?

15:42.890 --> 15:46.439
- Jamie is your fiance?

15:48.492 --> 15:49.326
- Fiance.

15:52.249 --> 15:53.919
- He's lovely.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.728
He's really lovely.

15:55.728 --> 15:58.164
Bless him, he's been so worried.

15:58.164 --> 15:59.172
- I can't.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.582
- You'll be just fine.

16:02.582 --> 16:04.461
He just wants to see you.

16:07.558 --> 16:09.888
Anyway, he'll be here tomorrow afternoon.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.385
I'll go and get the hair dryer

16:15.385 --> 16:17.264
before you catch your death of cold.

16:18.691 --> 16:21.822
(Doreen vocalizing)

16:23.840 --> 16:25.614
- Mom, wait.

16:25.649 --> 16:28.049
(Doreen vocalizing)

16:28.049 --> 16:29.371
Mom!

16:29.407 --> 16:32.538
(Doreen vocalizing)

16:37.408 --> 16:39.983
(eerie music)

16:56.161 --> 16:57.170
(tense music)

16:57.170 --> 16:58.562
- I'm sorry.

16:58.596 --> 17:00.998
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

17:02.110 --> 17:04.025
- It's okay, it's Jamie?

17:05.485 --> 17:06.599
- Yeah, that's me.

17:08.025 --> 17:10.530
- My mom told me you were coming.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.870
- Yeah, I got here about an hour ago.

17:17.001 --> 17:18.463
I didn't mean to-- - No, no,

17:19.959 --> 17:20.793
it's fine.

17:20.829 --> 17:22.290
Just a weird night.

17:23.786 --> 17:24.656
Where is she?

17:24.656 --> 17:25.699
- Your mom?

17:25.734 --> 17:27.091
She went out somewhere.

17:28.344 --> 17:30.848
She said she wanted to give us some time alone.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.136
- Did she say where she went?

17:32.136 --> 17:34.258
- Something about medicine for your dad?

17:37.772 --> 17:40.346
She didn't think you'd wake up while she was gone.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.852
I'm already talking too much.

17:45.601 --> 17:48.105
Look, I've really missed you.

17:51.132 --> 17:53.289
I was with you every day in the hospital.

17:54.542 --> 17:58.438
But to hear your voice finally.

17:59.622 --> 18:02.022
- It's sweet. - I have my moments.

18:02.022 --> 18:05.466
- I'm really sorry, I can't remember anything.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.667
- Your mom, she said your memory is--

18:08.667 --> 18:09.711
- Shot to shit.

18:10.755 --> 18:12.494
- Not her exact words, but--

18:14.477 --> 18:17.504
She said you don't remember much at all.

18:17.504 --> 18:21.018
- I can remember some things.

18:21.053 --> 18:22.967
I mean, mostly basic everyday stuff,

18:22.967 --> 18:27.768
but I can't remember my mother, my father,

18:30.969 --> 18:32.534
Or you I'm afraid.

18:35.144 --> 18:36.814
- Yeah, that's pretty much what she told me.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.162
- What do I do?

18:41.198 --> 18:42.276
- You mean what's your job?

18:42.276 --> 18:45.129
- Yeah. - You work at a bank

18:45.164 --> 18:47.739
in the city, that's how we met.

18:47.739 --> 18:49.234
- A bank.

18:49.304 --> 18:52.957
- Yeah, you're a cashier and I'm a financial advisor.

18:54.036 --> 18:56.923
I advice customers on--

18:56.923 --> 18:58.872
- Yeah, I know what a financial advisor is.

18:58.906 --> 19:01.098
- Well, all in all it's about as interesting

19:01.098 --> 19:02.351
as watching paint dry,

19:02.386 --> 19:06.108
but I met you, that's the important thing.

19:08.474 --> 19:10.144
- So how long have we--

19:12.753 --> 19:15.606
- Maybe your mom's right, we shouldn't rush this--

19:15.606 --> 19:16.650
- No, no, please.

19:19.156 --> 19:22.565
I feel completely confused, I'm so alone.

19:26.079 --> 19:26.914
- Four years.

19:28.062 --> 19:28.897
- My God.

19:29.871 --> 19:31.541
- [Jamie] Yeah.

19:31.541 --> 19:34.464
- Wait, we've been together for four years.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.577
- It's okay.

19:38.117 --> 19:39.717
(Rose chuckles)

19:39.717 --> 19:40.970
- I can't even remember,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.693
wow, sorry.

19:44.693 --> 19:45.632
- No, please.

19:46.502 --> 19:47.894
It will all come back.

19:47.894 --> 19:49.529
It will.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.381
Maybe we should just slow things down.

19:52.381 --> 19:53.947
- My mother, she-- - What?

19:55.443 --> 19:57.218
- I'm just trying to piece everything together

19:57.218 --> 19:59.931
and there's my father and I-- - What about him?

20:00.001 --> 20:02.192
- Well, I haven't even seen him.

20:02.192 --> 20:05.776
- Rose, this is a bit difficult.

20:05.811 --> 20:06.924
- No, please.

20:08.038 --> 20:08.873
- Okay.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.995
Well, as far as I know,

20:10.995 --> 20:14.961
your dad had some kind of breakdown about two years ago

20:14.996 --> 20:17.501
and that's when she retired.

20:17.501 --> 20:18.788
- What kind of a breakdown.

20:18.824 --> 20:22.580
- Look Rose, don't take this the wrong way but,

20:24.215 --> 20:27.973
well, in a lot of ways, I'm the exact same position as you.

20:29.470 --> 20:31.279
- What do you mean?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.505
- I've never even spoken to your mother

20:33.505 --> 20:35.592
before she phoned me about the accident.

20:37.506 --> 20:38.341
- What?

20:38.411 --> 20:39.663
- Hello, Jamie.

20:39.699 --> 20:41.820
I think we need to have a little talk.

20:43.699 --> 20:46.274
(eerie music)

20:47.770 --> 20:51.771
I'd be lying if I said you and I had easy relationship,

20:51.841 --> 20:54.902
you were, how did your father put it?

20:54.902 --> 20:56.781
A bit of a free spirit.

20:58.451 --> 21:01.269
I'd have said you were reckless and a bit of a madam.

21:02.209 --> 21:04.296
- Tell me what you really think.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.079
So we argue.

21:07.149 --> 21:09.862
- Constantly, the neighbors were always complaining.

21:09.862 --> 21:10.733
- I don't--

21:12.194 --> 21:14.838
- The thing is you wanted to go off traveling,

21:16.369 --> 21:18.839
I had no objection to that, in fact, I encouraged it.

21:18.909 --> 21:21.413
I just wanted you to save

21:21.449 --> 21:24.788
so that when you returned, you wouldn't be struggling.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.581
Oh, what's the point.

21:31.225 --> 21:33.591
You went off with your friends

21:33.625 --> 21:37.556
with virtually no preparation and not even a goodbye.

21:40.758 --> 21:43.367
- How long did we not speak?

21:43.436 --> 21:44.306
- Well, Rose.

21:46.081 --> 21:51.195
When I saw you in the hospital, it had been 10 years.

21:51.229 --> 21:53.944
(Doreen crying)

22:12.174 --> 22:14.923
(gentle music)

22:21.325 --> 22:23.934
(eerie music)

22:45.470 --> 22:46.654
- What's that?

22:49.471 --> 22:54.029
- It's Ninny, she was yours when you were a little girl,

22:54.029 --> 22:56.534
you took her everywhere with you.

22:59.005 --> 23:00.222
Don't you remember?

23:02.170 --> 23:04.153
She was your bestest friend.

23:05.893 --> 23:07.355
I think she's missed you.

23:09.268 --> 23:10.103
- You think?

23:11.425 --> 23:13.339
- Hello Rosey-wosey-woo

23:13.373 --> 23:15.391
- Oh, please. Don't call me that.

23:15.391 --> 23:17.688
- I've missed you so, so, so much.

23:20.888 --> 23:23.602
- I've missed you too.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.934
- Why did you leave me all alone?

23:26.872 --> 23:28.334
Come on.

23:28.368 --> 23:30.039
You could tell me.

23:31.221 --> 23:32.265
- I don't know.

23:32.265 --> 23:36.440
- Well, guess what? I do.

23:36.475 --> 23:39.050
- You do? - Yes of course.

23:39.084 --> 23:43.468
It's because you are very, very naughty girl

23:43.468 --> 23:46.390
and you don't do as you're told,

23:46.390 --> 23:48.512
you really upset your poor mother.

23:50.427 --> 23:54.219
Don't look at her, she can't help you now.

23:54.219 --> 23:55.610
- Oh, come on.

23:55.646 --> 23:56.480
- Come on, what?

23:56.515 --> 23:57.350
Rosey-wosey-woo

23:58.811 --> 24:00.969
- Please don't call me that.

24:01.003 --> 24:05.318
- I think it's time you started to take more responsibility

24:05.318 --> 24:07.822
for some of the things you've done.

24:07.857 --> 24:09.353
- What things?

24:10.745 --> 24:14.293
- I know a song you used to sing with mother.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.146
♪ It's raining it's pouring

24:17.146 --> 24:18.991
♪ The old man snoring

24:18.991 --> 24:20.834
♪ He went to bed and bumped his head ♪

24:20.834 --> 24:22.748
♪ And couldn't get up in the morning ♪

24:22.783 --> 24:25.532
(Doreen laughs)

24:26.888 --> 24:28.141
And there's another one,

24:28.175 --> 24:29.463
there's another one.

24:29.463 --> 24:30.924
♪ Oranges and lemons

24:30.959 --> 24:32.977
♪ Say the bells of St. Clement's ♪

24:33.011 --> 24:35.343
♪ You owe me five farthings

24:35.343 --> 24:39.518
♪ Say the bells of St. Martins

24:39.518 --> 24:42.022
- Will you please shut the fuck up.

24:42.022 --> 24:42.857
- Bitch!

24:48.737 --> 24:49.572
- Jesus.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.225
Oh fuck.

24:56.809 --> 24:59.488
(eerie music)

25:03.594 --> 25:07.873
- So, you can't remember at all?

25:07.873 --> 25:08.708
- I don't know, Jamie,

25:08.743 --> 25:10.203
I don't know.

25:10.203 --> 25:11.978
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

25:12.013 --> 25:14.727
Oh yeah, that's right, I already have.

25:14.727 --> 25:16.014
- Take it easy.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.754
- I'm glad you were here.

25:18.728 --> 25:21.755
- Well, here are the love birds.

25:21.755 --> 25:23.634
How is everything?

25:23.634 --> 25:25.895
- Fine. - Fine, thank you Mrs. Baker.

25:25.895 --> 25:27.947
- Oh, do call me mom.

25:27.983 --> 25:29.862
- Sure, mom.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.332
- I was just about to ask Jamie about our friends.

25:32.366 --> 25:33.863
- You were? - Yeah.

25:33.863 --> 25:35.115
- Friends?

25:35.149 --> 25:36.471
- Yeah, our friends.

25:38.002 --> 25:39.917
- I really don't think that's a good idea.

25:39.951 --> 25:41.447
- Nicci, I can call Nicci.

25:41.447 --> 25:42.699
- Nicci

25:42.734 --> 25:43.813
- Yeah, Nicci, he's an absolute sweetheart.

25:43.882 --> 25:45.413
You and her go way back.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.570
Her boyfriend, Marcus owes me a bit of money actually.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.483
Nice guy, bit of a dick, but nice guy.

25:49.553 --> 25:51.154
- In all honesty, I really don't--

25:51.154 --> 25:53.763
- No, no, no, do it. Call her.

25:53.798 --> 25:56.373
Nicci, she sounds lovely.

25:56.373 --> 25:57.938
- Brill, maybe we can-- - No.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.487
Now don't push it too far, Jamie.

26:02.983 --> 26:06.010
I understand how excited you are and you too Rose,

26:06.010 --> 26:08.654
but the brain is a fragile thing,

26:08.689 --> 26:11.089
too much, too soon and-- - Yeah but,

26:11.089 --> 26:13.490
mom surely a phone call wouldn't hurt.

26:14.986 --> 26:18.952
- I have been a doctor of psychology for 38 years.

26:18.987 --> 26:20.831
Seven of those as a surgeon,

26:20.866 --> 26:23.788
and I've been a casualty doctor for four.

26:23.788 --> 26:26.259
Now, if anybody is gonna know the best way to proceed,

26:26.259 --> 26:27.372
it's going to be me.

26:29.007 --> 26:30.816
Jamie, put the phone away.

26:33.669 --> 26:35.791
Now perhaps you'd like to come and help me get some tea.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.427
- Yeah, sure. - Thank you.

26:38.367 --> 26:40.731
- I'll be back in a minute.

26:43.167 --> 26:46.821
(Doreen vocalizing)

26:46.855 --> 26:49.430
(eerie music)

27:08.878 --> 27:12.218
- So I have a surprise for you.

27:12.254 --> 27:16.219
- Ooh, is Ninny going to serenade us again?

27:17.994 --> 27:18.829
- No.

27:20.604 --> 27:21.960
- Well what is it then?

27:21.960 --> 27:24.813
- It's the obligatory baby photos.

27:24.847 --> 27:26.309
- Of course.

27:26.309 --> 27:28.153
- Oh, look at them.

27:28.153 --> 27:29.128
Look.

27:29.128 --> 27:30.484
Look at them. - Look at these.

27:30.519 --> 27:32.224
- Can I have a look.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.512
- Jogging any memories?

27:40.121 --> 27:42.000
- Not yet. - Well, maybe this will.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.236
Back in a jiffy.

27:50.490 --> 27:53.238
(girl laughing)

27:58.561 --> 27:59.674
- What is it?

28:01.240 --> 28:02.632
- What have I done to this family?

28:02.632 --> 28:03.640
- What do you mean?

28:05.171 --> 28:07.016
You haven't done anything?

28:07.016 --> 28:07.851
- No?

28:09.138 --> 28:13.243
Then why does she seem so broken?

28:13.278 --> 28:14.182
- She's all right.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.237
- Here it is.

28:31.579 --> 28:32.413
Eureka.

28:35.197 --> 28:36.658
- Who's that in the photo next to me?

28:36.693 --> 28:38.154
- Well, me of course.

28:39.511 --> 28:40.798
She's a dear little girl.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.686
- What happened to it?

28:43.721 --> 28:44.661
- Oh, I don't know.

28:44.661 --> 28:47.304
I've got the negative somewhere.

28:47.304 --> 28:48.592
- I'd like to see it.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.958
- Oh well, perhaps you will at that.

28:52.975 --> 28:55.968
Anyway, I think that's enough excitement for today.

28:57.568 --> 28:59.760
- Yeah, I should be going.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.534
- Where are you staying? - Staying?

29:01.569 --> 29:03.308
- You can't be commuting, surely.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.456
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.744
- Well, why don't you stay here?

29:05.744 --> 29:07.936
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

29:07.936 --> 29:09.605
- Mom, it's a hell of a commute.

29:10.789 --> 29:13.503
- I really want Jamie staying here.

29:13.537 --> 29:14.929
Call me old fashioned.

29:14.929 --> 29:16.182
- Come on, mom.

29:16.216 --> 29:17.782
Let's face it, given the current situation,

29:17.782 --> 29:20.948
I'm hardly gonna be creeping around in the hallway, am I?

29:21.018 --> 29:22.513
You know what I mean?

29:22.549 --> 29:25.053
- You would be surprised what obstacles can be overcome

29:25.053 --> 29:26.898
when hormones are raging.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.254
- [Rose] Mom.

29:28.254 --> 29:32.221
- This is the most uncomfortable moment in my life.

29:32.221 --> 29:33.890
Look, I can't stay anyway,

29:33.890 --> 29:35.595
I have to go back to work tomorrow.

29:35.630 --> 29:37.370
- See, see, he's got work tomorrow.

29:37.404 --> 29:40.153
You wouldn't want him to lose his job, would you?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.579
Well, would you?

29:41.614 --> 29:44.572
- No. No, of course not.

29:44.572 --> 29:47.250
- Well, I'm glad that settled then?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.268
I'll give you a moment to say goodbye.

29:50.694 --> 29:53.443
(gentle music)

29:57.723 --> 29:59.254
- And there was me thinking

29:59.254 --> 30:00.959
I was gonna let you have your wicked away with me.

30:02.141 --> 30:03.325
- Yeah, about the kiss.

30:05.098 --> 30:06.769
- You can do it again if you want.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.413
- Really?

30:09.482 --> 30:10.317
- No.

30:11.639 --> 30:13.344
- Of course, really.

30:20.129 --> 30:23.573
- I have a spare phone and I'll be back in two days,

30:23.607 --> 30:26.460
I'll bring it and then we can stay in touch.

30:26.460 --> 30:27.261
Okay.

30:42.326 --> 30:43.683
- Hello mom.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.162
Mom, I can't hear you.

30:48.415 --> 30:50.294
Mom, I think you've rung me by accident.

30:50.294 --> 30:51.128
Hello?

30:55.303 --> 30:56.138
- Rose.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.323
(Rose gasps)

31:12.247 --> 31:15.134
(birds chirping)

31:25.920 --> 31:28.494
(eerie music)

31:34.722 --> 31:37.193
- I think I'll pop to the shops this afternoon

31:37.193 --> 31:40.358
and get you some medication.

31:41.716 --> 31:42.550
- Okay.

31:46.099 --> 31:46.935
- Like this.

31:51.979 --> 31:54.101
Of course I blame myself.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.659
In fact, the whole thing's a bloody disaster.

32:00.329 --> 32:02.347
We never catch a break, do we Rose?

32:03.425 --> 32:04.260
No.

32:05.304 --> 32:06.139
Spit.

32:09.270 --> 32:11.706
Not in the bath.

32:11.706 --> 32:12.540
(tense music)

32:12.576 --> 32:13.584
- Jesus.

32:13.584 --> 32:16.403
- In the cup for God's sake.

32:16.437 --> 32:18.247
Well some things never change,

32:18.247 --> 32:20.473
you're just as irritating as you always were.

32:21.761 --> 32:24.927
(tense music)

32:24.961 --> 32:26.213
I'm so sorry, Rose.

32:27.954 --> 32:30.250
Let me get you some fresh towels.

32:31.363 --> 32:32.650
Back in a jiffy.

32:34.076 --> 32:36.651
(eerie music)

32:47.158 --> 32:49.176
- Just you and me then.

32:50.255 --> 32:52.343
Careful you don't drown.

32:53.699 --> 32:56.309
(eerie music)

33:44.565 --> 33:47.522
- Are you sure? It's all right for me to leave you.

33:47.522 --> 33:50.549
- Of course, I'll be fine mom.

33:50.619 --> 33:53.541
- Rose, I'm sorry I hit you.

33:53.576 --> 33:55.106
I shouldn't have done it.

33:55.106 --> 33:56.568
It won't happen again.

33:59.143 --> 34:01.230
- It's okay, don't worry about it.

34:01.230 --> 34:02.900
I'll be fine.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.257
- I'll be back in a jiffy.

34:05.858 --> 34:07.214
- Okay.

34:07.249 --> 34:09.372
- Mom? - Yes, dear.

34:09.372 --> 34:11.320
- How long is a jiffy?

34:11.389 --> 34:13.894
- About an hour. - Okay.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.226
- I'll be back before you know it, Poppet.

34:17.512 --> 34:20.435
(Doreen vocalizing)

34:20.470 --> 34:23.392
- Oh mom. Yes, dear.

34:23.392 --> 34:24.854
- I love you. - I love you too.

34:28.298 --> 34:31.464
(Doreen vocalizing)

34:47.955 --> 34:50.878
- Oh, come on.

34:50.878 --> 34:53.801
- Right, come on then Ninny, Fuck.

34:53.801 --> 34:56.305
(Rose thuds)

34:59.019 --> 35:01.768
(Rose grunting)

35:17.320 --> 35:18.851
Shit.

35:18.921 --> 35:21.391
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

35:21.460 --> 35:24.835
(gentle upbeat music)

35:26.540 --> 35:29.218
(Rose grunting)

35:54.477 --> 35:57.191
(Rose panting)

36:08.394 --> 36:11.177
(Rose grunting)

36:12.465 --> 36:15.735
(gentle upbeat music)

36:31.112 --> 36:33.861
(Rose grunting)

36:34.975 --> 36:37.062
(Rose panting)

36:37.098 --> 36:38.384
All right.

36:38.454 --> 36:40.889
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

36:40.889 --> 36:43.569
(Rose panting)

37:19.161 --> 37:19.996
Clara.

37:21.735 --> 37:22.570
Clara.

37:33.321 --> 37:35.130
All right, all right.

37:40.244 --> 37:41.392
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.410
Please, please, please.

37:45.254 --> 37:46.090
Pick up.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.151
- Rose.

37:49.151 --> 37:50.229
Oh God, Rose.

37:50.265 --> 37:51.517
- Clara.

37:51.517 --> 37:53.465
- Oh God, it's so good to see your face.

37:53.465 --> 37:55.135
Are you okay? Are you all right?

37:56.492 --> 37:59.554
Oh God, you can't remember me, can you?

37:59.554 --> 38:01.432
- I don't know, it's bits and pieces.

38:01.467 --> 38:03.694
I remember a garden party and--

38:04.737 --> 38:06.094
- Yeah, that was Tim 40th.

38:06.164 --> 38:07.660
It was just before your accident.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.948
- Tim.

38:08.982 --> 38:12.009
- Yeah, Tim he's he's my husband Rose.

38:12.044 --> 38:13.644
- I'm so sorry, I just can't--

38:13.644 --> 38:17.681
- No, it's fine please, don't (indistinct).

38:17.715 --> 38:19.176
God, Rose, it's been about 12 weeks

38:19.211 --> 38:20.776
since I've seen you or heard from you

38:20.776 --> 38:22.203
and I've been so worried

38:22.203 --> 38:24.813
and God there's just so much I need to ask you

38:24.847 --> 38:28.918
and Rose I'm sorry, I just have so many questions.

38:28.918 --> 38:29.753
- Me too.

38:31.771 --> 38:34.206
- [Clara] Yeah, I can imagine.

38:34.206 --> 38:35.459
- So has my mom contacted you?

38:35.529 --> 38:36.989
Have you heard from her or--

38:36.989 --> 38:37.963
- Not since your initial,

38:37.963 --> 38:40.051
well the initial contact,

38:40.121 --> 38:41.547
she sent me an email,

38:41.547 --> 38:43.148
but that is that's literally all I've heard,

38:43.148 --> 38:44.400
I haven't heard anything since.

38:44.435 --> 38:46.070
- There is something seriously wrong here.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.202
- What is it? What's wrong? - I don't know.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.525
- I mean, I wanna come see you,

38:54.525 --> 38:58.039
I mean, I suggested it to your mom but she flat out refused.

38:58.039 --> 38:59.743
- Well she thinks it could damage me

38:59.778 --> 39:02.945
and like harm my recovery.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.458
- Recovery process. - Yeah.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.885
- Rose, I'm not an expert

39:07.885 --> 39:09.380
but that's not how it works, darling.

39:09.416 --> 39:10.702
- What do you mean?

39:10.772 --> 39:12.790
- Well, I mean, after we spoke to your mom,

39:12.790 --> 39:15.470
Tim did a bit of research and--

39:18.565 --> 39:20.688
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

39:35.127 --> 39:38.258
(car engine roaring)

39:39.440 --> 39:42.119
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

39:42.119 --> 39:44.695
(tense music)

39:52.870 --> 39:54.331
Oh fuck, oh fuck.

39:56.767 --> 39:59.480
(Rose panting)

40:06.021 --> 40:08.596
(tense music)

40:40.465 --> 40:43.632
(Doreen vocalizing)

41:10.873 --> 41:13.065
So were you able to get it, then?

41:13.100 --> 41:13.935
- Get it?

41:15.257 --> 41:16.301
- The medication?

41:26.356 --> 41:28.930
- This was out there.

41:28.930 --> 41:32.027
- Oh dear mommy, do you not remember putting it there?

41:33.870 --> 41:35.158
Oh, well.

41:35.158 --> 41:36.723
Well perhaps your memory isn't what it once was,

41:36.793 --> 41:41.281
but then, well, as you say, the mind is a fragile thing.

41:47.926 --> 41:49.457
- Would you like a cup of tea?

41:50.675 --> 41:51.510
- Yes.

41:52.588 --> 41:53.423
And a biscuit.

42:00.904 --> 42:03.792
- Oh, you're playing with Ninny.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.714
Wosey-wosey-woo.

42:08.071 --> 42:10.646
(eerie music)

42:43.732 --> 42:45.298
- Fuck you Ninny.

42:49.229 --> 42:52.326
(Rose sighs)

42:52.360 --> 42:54.936
(eerie music)

43:17.410 --> 43:18.977
- Rise and shine.

43:19.011 --> 43:20.681
How about a cup of tea?

43:20.681 --> 43:23.082
- Oh yeah, that'd be lovely.

43:25.239 --> 43:28.892
Mom, are you planning on going out today?

43:28.892 --> 43:30.145
- What?

43:30.179 --> 43:31.640
- I was just wondering

43:31.676 --> 43:34.946
if you were planning on going out anywhere.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.895
- No, not today.

43:36.929 --> 43:38.878
You've got me all to yourself.

43:44.896 --> 43:49.488
So, Jamie is coming tomorrow, that'll brighten up your day.

43:49.488 --> 43:50.428
- Yeah.

43:50.463 --> 43:51.716
- He's a sweet boy.

43:51.750 --> 43:54.638
A pity I didn't know him before though.

43:55.716 --> 43:56.656
- Yeah.

43:56.726 --> 43:58.743
- He's very good looking.

43:58.743 --> 44:02.083
I bet you can't wait to, you know.

44:02.119 --> 44:03.649
- What?

44:03.684 --> 44:06.502
- You know, make feet for children's stockings.

44:07.963 --> 44:08.798
- What?

44:08.833 --> 44:10.642
- Grinding the corn.

44:10.642 --> 44:11.477
- What?

44:12.729 --> 44:15.339
- Do you still find him sexually attractive?

44:15.339 --> 44:19.027
- Mom, I don't-- - Come on, you can tell me,

44:19.027 --> 44:21.115
I'm your mother after all.

44:23.271 --> 44:27.273
So we are gonna have a nice roast.

44:27.342 --> 44:28.978
- Oh, a roast.

44:29.047 --> 44:30.230
- Yes, a roast chicken.

44:31.204 --> 44:34.475
- Oh, I've just remembered,

44:35.449 --> 44:37.884
I really like roast lamb.

44:38.963 --> 44:41.954
- But I don't have any lamb.

44:42.024 --> 44:44.356
- Oh, that's such a shame

44:44.390 --> 44:46.930
'cause that's really what I wanted.

44:46.930 --> 44:49.296
- Well you'll just have to make do with chicken.

44:49.365 --> 44:50.653
- But don't you think

44:50.687 --> 44:52.009
you might be able to go and get me some.

44:54.201 --> 44:56.011
- I don't even know where to go.

44:56.011 --> 44:59.525
- You could go down to the shop that you went to yesterday.

44:59.525 --> 45:01.647
- Oh, but that's too far to walk.

45:01.681 --> 45:02.899
- Well you could drive.

45:04.952 --> 45:08.188
- The car's been all put away for the night and everything.

45:08.188 --> 45:10.518
No, I can't, I can't go.

45:10.588 --> 45:12.085
I can't get that.

45:12.085 --> 45:14.589
- No, but it would really mean everything to me.

45:14.625 --> 45:17.720
You should know that lamb is my favorite.

45:19.529 --> 45:21.374
- I haven't got any mint sauce.

45:21.374 --> 45:24.470
- Well, you could get the mint sauce when you got the lamb.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.271
- I really don't feel like going all that way

45:29.306 --> 45:30.802
just to get lamb.

45:30.838 --> 45:33.168
- Well maybe you could do the weekly shop when you went.

45:33.238 --> 45:34.769
- I haven't got time.

45:34.769 --> 45:37.343
- Maybe you could make time if it mattered to you.

45:41.275 --> 45:44.579
It's not like I ask that often for things, mom.

45:45.519 --> 45:46.528
- True.

45:48.686 --> 45:51.503
Can't you just make do.

45:51.539 --> 45:53.800
- But we had chicken yesterday.

45:57.349 --> 46:00.167
- Oh, I suppose so.

46:02.219 --> 46:03.158
Okay.

46:05.037 --> 46:06.290
I'll be back in a jiffy.

46:07.369 --> 46:08.726
- Thank you mommy.

46:10.186 --> 46:12.761
(eerie music)

46:24.730 --> 46:26.922
I think I'm a vegetarian.

46:29.739 --> 46:30.574
Fuck this.

46:31.653 --> 46:34.367
(upbeat music)

46:46.996 --> 46:48.667
Come on Ninny.

46:48.667 --> 46:51.345
(upbeat music)

46:59.034 --> 47:01.539
(Rose grunts)

47:01.539 --> 47:04.219
(upbeat music)

48:25.179 --> 48:27.787
(eerie music)

48:31.407 --> 48:34.120
(Rose screams)

48:34.155 --> 48:35.268
- What are you doing in here?

48:35.338 --> 48:36.938
- What's my stuff doing in here.

48:36.938 --> 48:38.260
What's this about?

48:38.295 --> 48:40.522
- It's for evidence. - Evidence for what?

48:40.522 --> 48:43.201
- Someone was killed in that crash Rose,

48:43.201 --> 48:45.184
there was a woman in the car with you.

48:47.202 --> 48:48.628
- You are lying.

48:48.628 --> 48:50.924
- Go to your room now. - No.

48:53.012 --> 48:55.726
- What did I just tell you? - You're a crazy bitch.

48:57.883 --> 48:58.927
- My God.

48:58.961 --> 49:00.666
You monster.

49:00.736 --> 49:02.405
- Go to your room now. - No.

49:16.531 --> 49:17.366
Crazy bitch.

49:25.125 --> 49:28.117
(knock on door)

49:28.152 --> 49:29.891
- [Doreen] I should apologize.

49:29.926 --> 49:32.222
- It's fine, forget about it.

49:33.718 --> 49:36.224
- [Doreen] You were drunk when you got in the car.

49:36.224 --> 49:39.772
I managed to get your stuff back before the police did.

49:39.806 --> 49:41.755
You could go to prison you know.

49:43.599 --> 49:46.974
I can't lose you as well as your father,

49:47.008 --> 49:48.992
he'll never be the same.

49:49.027 --> 49:50.766
I can't lose you too.

49:53.028 --> 49:56.855
- It's fine, I forgive you.

49:56.855 --> 49:59.777
- Please Poppet, move away from the door.

50:10.215 --> 50:11.780
Give mommy a cuddle.

50:19.296 --> 50:22.427
I think I'll sleep in your room tonight.

50:23.644 --> 50:24.897
- Don't worry about it, I'll be fine.

50:24.932 --> 50:26.845
- Oh, I think I will.

50:26.881 --> 50:29.942
Well, Jamie coming tomorrow for Sunday dinner,

50:29.942 --> 50:31.855
it'll be marvelous.

50:31.890 --> 50:34.013
Like a real family.

50:37.561 --> 50:40.066
I know it's difficult sometimes Rose

50:40.101 --> 50:43.197
but I just want you to know

50:43.197 --> 50:45.911
I love you my Rosey-Wosey-woo

50:46.920 --> 50:48.451
- I love you too mommy.

51:41.682 --> 51:44.257
(eerie music)

51:52.607 --> 51:53.442
Hello?

51:57.303 --> 51:58.138
Hello?

52:00.713 --> 52:02.071
Is anyone there?

52:06.071 --> 52:06.907
Mom.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.533
Mom.

52:11.569 --> 52:13.656
(tense music)

52:13.726 --> 52:14.770
Mom.

52:14.804 --> 52:17.379
(tense music)

52:33.348 --> 52:36.027
(Rose panting)

52:41.489 --> 52:44.203
(eerie music)

53:49.924 --> 53:51.525
- There she is.

53:53.055 --> 53:56.396
Ooh, you've got a little bit of color in your face today.

53:56.431 --> 53:57.230
Lovely.

53:59.353 --> 54:02.241
I've done my hair, do you like it?

54:02.241 --> 54:04.502
- That looks lovely.

54:04.537 --> 54:05.372
(doorbell rings)

54:05.407 --> 54:07.982
- Oh, that'll be Jamie.

54:07.982 --> 54:08.956
Back ina jiffy.

54:18.836 --> 54:21.168
Here she is.

54:21.168 --> 54:22.002
- Thanks.

54:28.474 --> 54:29.308
Hey. - Hi.

54:29.344 --> 54:31.361
- Jamie bought wine.

54:31.396 --> 54:32.892
- Just from the shop on the way in.

54:32.892 --> 54:36.824
- Talking of that, how about a little tipple now?

54:36.859 --> 54:37.764
Jamie?

54:37.764 --> 54:39.050
- Yeah. - Rose?

54:39.120 --> 54:42.982
Oh, no you can't, I forgot.

54:42.982 --> 54:44.061
Back in a jiffy.

54:45.347 --> 54:46.809
- Hey. - Jamie.

54:48.166 --> 54:49.001
- What?

54:50.706 --> 54:52.654
- This is gonna sound really, really crazy.

54:52.654 --> 54:53.489
- What?

55:00.412 --> 55:01.596
- That's not my mother.

55:04.587 --> 55:06.258
- Is this-- - No,

55:06.258 --> 55:07.510
I'm being serious.

55:09.563 --> 55:12.799
- Well, Rose, I don't understand.

55:12.799 --> 55:13.807
- You never met her before, did you?

55:13.807 --> 55:14.851
Before the accident?

55:14.851 --> 55:16.313
- No, I--

55:16.347 --> 55:18.156
- And when was the first time,

55:18.192 --> 55:20.558
did you actually ever see me in a hospital?

55:20.558 --> 55:22.888
- The first time I saw you was here in this house?

55:22.922 --> 55:25.080
- Oh my God. Look just search it, Google it.

55:25.115 --> 55:28.664
Look, just look up, there was a girl in an accident and--

55:28.698 --> 55:30.403
- What I-- - Look,

55:33.882 --> 55:37.570
she told me that I was in an accident

55:37.570 --> 55:41.467
and she said that there was another woman that died.

55:41.501 --> 55:42.824
- She said you were hit by a car.

55:42.824 --> 55:45.085
- She said I was in a car crash.

55:47.138 --> 55:48.843
- Your car is parked outside.

55:50.444 --> 55:51.661
- Oh, fucking hell.

55:51.661 --> 55:53.087
- Yeah, fucking hell.

55:54.688 --> 55:55.731
- Oh my God.

55:57.506 --> 55:58.341
Look.

55:59.349 --> 56:00.672
- What?

56:00.741 --> 56:02.516
- Wait, wait.

56:02.516 --> 56:03.351
- What?

56:04.847 --> 56:07.526
(Rose panting)

56:09.196 --> 56:10.240
- This is my mom.

56:12.223 --> 56:13.789
- Then, what, who?

56:17.337 --> 56:18.172
- Doreen.

56:21.999 --> 56:23.808
Rose, mom and Doreen.

56:28.366 --> 56:30.453
Next fucking door.

56:30.523 --> 56:32.367
- She's your neighbor!

56:33.585 --> 56:35.394
I should call the police.

56:35.394 --> 56:36.925
- [Doreen] Jamie?

56:38.561 --> 56:40.091
- What do I do?

56:40.091 --> 56:42.840
- I don't know, just go and see what she wants.

56:42.909 --> 56:44.371
- [Doreen] Jamie!

56:46.040 --> 56:46.841
Jamie.

56:55.816 --> 56:58.496
(Rose sighs)

56:58.496 --> 57:01.523
- Come on, come on, pick up, pick up.

57:01.592 --> 57:04.166
Please Clara pick up, pick up.

57:09.177 --> 57:11.334
Oh, thank God. - Rose, hey.

57:11.368 --> 57:12.691
What is it? Are you okay?

57:12.726 --> 57:13.874
- Clara listen, I've got no time to waste at all,

57:13.874 --> 57:15.787
I need to know, who is this?

57:19.614 --> 57:21.389
- Rose, that's your mom.

57:21.389 --> 57:22.189
- What?

57:23.859 --> 57:24.937
And this, who's this?

57:28.034 --> 57:30.608
- That's your mom's really, really weird neighbor.

57:32.070 --> 57:35.202
Mrs. Baker, I think her name was Doreen or something.

57:35.236 --> 57:36.488
Why do you wanna know?

57:36.488 --> 57:38.750
- I need you to come here now today.

57:38.784 --> 57:40.211
- Okay?

57:40.211 --> 57:42.090
Okay, I'm gonna get my keys.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.620
I'm coming out. What is it, what's wrong?

57:43.620 --> 57:46.300
- Things are really fucked up.

57:46.335 --> 57:48.492
Please hurry. - Okay.

57:48.492 --> 57:50.788
Rose I'm coming now, where is your mom?

57:50.788 --> 57:54.024
- I don't know, it's just me, my dad

57:54.058 --> 57:56.981
that weird woman and well Jamie, at least.

57:59.312 --> 58:00.146
- Who?

58:00.182 --> 58:01.017
- Jamie.

58:02.443 --> 58:03.278
My fiance.

58:04.357 --> 58:06.897
(eerie music)

58:06.897 --> 58:07.871
- Rose,

58:07.905 --> 58:10.619
Rose who the fuck is Jamie?

58:10.619 --> 58:12.777
- Your mom was struggling with the bottle.

58:14.307 --> 58:16.986
(eerie music)

58:18.030 --> 58:19.909
Who was that? - Clara?

58:24.919 --> 58:27.249
- She didn't like me very much.

58:27.284 --> 58:28.119
Never did.

58:30.138 --> 58:32.016
- Jamie did you bring your phone?

58:33.999 --> 58:36.643
I think we need to call the police now.

58:36.678 --> 58:37.513
- We could.

58:39.288 --> 58:40.123
- Jamie.

58:42.071 --> 58:43.637
When was the first time you saw me?

58:43.637 --> 58:46.350
Was it here or how was it in the hospital?

58:50.769 --> 58:52.091
Jamie, what's going on?

58:55.779 --> 58:58.979
- If only you weren't so-- - Curious.

59:01.241 --> 59:02.737
- She was on the phone with that Clara.

59:02.771 --> 59:04.407
- Oh, Clara.

59:04.407 --> 59:06.251
I never did like that girl.

59:06.251 --> 59:07.921
- She's on her way here now.

59:07.956 --> 59:09.452
- Then we'll have to deal with her

59:09.486 --> 59:11.644
the same way we dealt with your mother, won't we?

59:14.323 --> 59:17.245
I expect you are wondering what this is all about.

59:18.567 --> 59:23.021
You see retirement can be so boring at times.

59:24.239 --> 59:26.848
And jealousy is a very dangerous thing.

59:28.274 --> 59:31.719
And the desire to have a daughter can be overwhelming.

59:33.528 --> 59:35.442
It was a mother you see,

59:35.442 --> 59:39.617
she was suffering from sleeplessness, full blown insomnia.

59:39.651 --> 59:43.826
She needed help, hypnosis to calm down

59:43.826 --> 59:46.819
and rewire the brain if you like.

59:48.210 --> 59:51.098
Then I had a thought, an idea.

59:53.046 --> 59:57.465
You see it can be so disappointing to have a son

59:57.499 --> 59:59.517
when you've always wanted a daughter.

1:00:00.630 --> 1:00:03.205
(eerie music)

1:00:04.945 --> 1:00:07.450
(boy laughs)

1:00:12.112 --> 1:00:15.313
It's funny what life gives you, isn't it?

1:00:15.313 --> 1:00:17.330
A mother who wants a daughter

1:00:17.366 --> 1:00:20.149
and a daughter who doesn't want a mother.

1:00:20.149 --> 1:00:25.089
You should have seen her cry over you so many times,

1:00:25.124 --> 1:00:29.126
and you should have seen her expression once she realized

1:00:29.126 --> 1:00:32.708
she'd been quite literally stabbed in the back.

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:38.554
I'm told it's core at the sensation.

1:00:43.181 --> 1:00:44.259
- Hello, mom.

1:00:48.643 --> 1:00:50.105
Hello?

1:00:50.105 --> 1:00:50.939
Mom!

1:00:55.845 --> 1:00:58.245
(Rose screams)

1:00:58.281 --> 1:01:00.681
- Hypnosis, suggestion,

1:01:00.681 --> 1:01:03.395
it's a bit cruel, but it works.

1:01:03.464 --> 1:01:07.188
I once had a client who had irrational fear of heights.

1:01:07.256 --> 1:01:08.822
He's a pilot now.

1:01:08.822 --> 1:01:11.049
Can you believe it.

1:01:13.206 --> 1:01:18.425
I wanted your mother to reach out to you to change things

1:01:19.330 --> 1:01:20.825
so I could have a daughter.

1:01:20.895 --> 1:01:22.774
- I won't be your daughter, not ever.

1:01:24.617 --> 1:01:27.436
- I don't want you as a daughter.

1:01:28.897 --> 1:01:31.263
I had hoped the whole process

1:01:31.263 --> 1:01:36.447
could be done more bearably but it wasn't to be.

1:01:37.943 --> 1:01:41.144
I just wanted a new life, a better life for all of us.

1:01:41.179 --> 1:01:43.858
- What the are you talking about?

1:01:43.858 --> 1:01:47.684
- There are other ways of getting a daughter.

1:01:47.754 --> 1:01:49.494
Jamie run the bath.

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:56.417
You really should have given him a go.

1:01:56.452 --> 1:01:59.340
- I couldn't, even if I wanted to, which I don't.

1:02:00.592 --> 1:02:03.723
- Your legs, oh my dear, they're fine.

1:02:03.723 --> 1:02:05.464
It's just the relaxant.

1:02:05.464 --> 1:02:07.690
The effects will wear off.

1:02:07.725 --> 1:02:08.733
Eventually.

1:02:10.230 --> 1:02:13.988
- You fucking-- - Yes.

1:02:14.022 --> 1:02:17.780
Yes, it was to be the miracle of the century.

1:02:17.814 --> 1:02:19.241
You start walking again

1:02:19.241 --> 1:02:22.511
and you fall into the arms of my dopey son.

1:02:25.433 --> 1:02:26.408
- Hypnosis. - Yes.

1:02:27.417 --> 1:02:30.826
That and a cocktail or two

1:02:30.826 --> 1:02:33.541
to suppress certain brain functions.

1:02:33.575 --> 1:02:34.410
- How?

1:02:35.662 --> 1:02:37.193
- Would you like a cup of tea?

1:02:38.202 --> 1:02:40.394
- You fucking bitch!

1:02:40.429 --> 1:02:41.682
- That's my girl.

1:02:41.682 --> 1:02:43.838
You got bigger balls than Jamie.

1:02:46.691 --> 1:02:47.945
But it wasn't to be.

1:02:51.945 --> 1:02:56.295
It's your father, bringing some refreshments.

1:03:00.608 --> 1:03:02.522
Some music.

I had hoped of course,

1:05:55.993 --> 1:05:57.663
that Jamie would give you a child

1:05:57.663 --> 1:06:01.003
by more conventional means, but needs must.

1:06:03.335 --> 1:06:06.431

1:06:45.154 --> 1:06:46.720
