00:46.097 --> 00:47.631
Hi, Tanya.

00:47.697 --> 00:48.565
Hey, Max.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.717
I was up all night.

02:50.221 --> 02:52.189
And I got out a buncha pills

02:58.930 --> 03:00.831
and I was just staring
at 'em, you know?

03:07.805 --> 03:12.209
But, I'm too much of a pussy
to... to actually do it.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.082
But I wanted to, you know?

03:19.283 --> 03:21.518
I guess that's why
we're all here, right?

03:23.321 --> 03:25.056
Not following through
doesn't make you weak,

03:25.122 --> 03:26.690
it makes you strong.

03:28.826 --> 03:30.061
Okay?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.930
Fred, what you're feeling
right now is so common.

03:32.997 --> 03:33.998
Trust me.

03:34.065 --> 03:35.199
Yeah, because
wanting to die is just

03:35.266 --> 03:38.002
a rage that's sweeping
the country right now.

03:38.069 --> 03:41.604
Every 10 minutes someone
in America kills themselves.

03:41.671 --> 03:43.174
- It's true.
- Do you really think

03:44.909 --> 03:46.476
something like this,

03:49.780 --> 03:51.548
that therapy, can help?

03:52.249 --> 03:54.185
Can I tell you a story?

03:54.251 --> 03:58.322
My mom, she was...

03:58.389 --> 04:00.690
She was always angry and sad

04:00.758 --> 04:05.062
and one morning when I was
nine she killed herself.

04:10.101 --> 04:12.702
And I have wished
every morning since

04:14.105 --> 04:17.741
that she would have had the
strength to walk in that door

04:18.976 --> 04:20.043
like you guys did.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.049
To meet people, because I
know it makes a difference.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.004
So, I was thinking.

04:47.071 --> 04:49.639
Maybe you could
get your own clinic

04:49.706 --> 04:51.308
and then your hours
would be better.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.111
You know I need to
be on the front line.

04:54.178 --> 04:57.982
And, you know, I was
thinking one of us

04:58.049 --> 05:00.051
should probably have
a full time job.

05:01.152 --> 05:03.854
Is that a dig at
my retired lifestyle?

05:08.092 --> 05:08.959
No.

05:09.994 --> 05:11.862
But you know I have
to do what I do.

05:18.936 --> 05:22.973
So, I know we've only been
dating for a few months,

05:24.008 --> 05:25.309
but they've been amazing.

05:25.376 --> 05:26.243
Yeah.

05:27.311 --> 05:29.213
And I know you get
down on yourself,

05:30.948 --> 05:33.250
but I've seen what's
really inside of you and

05:35.786 --> 05:36.787
it's wonderful.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.857
And strong and...

05:45.396 --> 05:47.131
Now, don't freak out.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.168
For right now the only thing
that can make me any happier

05:53.904 --> 05:55.272
is if you were to say yes.

05:57.775 --> 05:58.641
Yes.

06:00.811 --> 06:01.678
Yes.

06:07.384 --> 06:08.618
I love you.

06:09.420 --> 06:10.321
I love you, too.

06:13.324 --> 06:14.458
She said yes.

06:14.525 --> 06:15.459
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:03.073 --> 07:03.941
Good morning.

07:06.410 --> 07:07.244
Morning.

07:08.279 --> 07:10.181
Now that we're
gonna get married

07:13.083 --> 07:16.887
maybe we should think about
getting a dog or a cat.

07:16.954 --> 07:18.189
What about a cat?

07:18.255 --> 07:19.523
Ye... I....

07:19.590 --> 07:20.690
Cats are cute.

07:20.758 --> 07:21.992
- Cats are cute.
- But they just kinda sit

07:22.059 --> 07:24.328
- there and litterboxes are-
- I know, but they purr.

07:24.395 --> 07:26.063
Yeah, dogs are much cuter.

07:26.130 --> 07:27.398
- Sure.
- Fetch it,

07:27.464 --> 07:28.332
then bring it back.

07:28.399 --> 07:31.168
Kitties purr.

07:31.235 --> 07:32.870
We'll talk about
this when I come back.

07:32.937 --> 07:34.004
Yeah, okay.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.842
Love you.

07:58.128 --> 07:59.163
May I use the ladies room?

07:59.230 --> 08:00.030
Where is it?

08:00.097 --> 08:00.898
Thank you.

10:14.064 --> 10:15.265
I'm Detective Neese.

10:16.266 --> 10:17.534
I'm assigned to your case.

10:19.269 --> 10:20.270
How you holding up?

10:21.672 --> 10:23.173
What happened to Gabriel?

10:25.309 --> 10:26.543
Okay, um...

10:28.011 --> 10:29.413
I'm just gonna level with you.

10:31.783 --> 10:33.550
Your fiance's the latest
victim of a known criminal.

10:34.786 --> 10:37.955
He stalks his
victims for months,

10:38.021 --> 10:41.125
takes pictures of what seems
to be everywhere they go,

10:41.191 --> 10:42.292
everything they do.

10:45.162 --> 10:48.065
Then he drugs and kidnaps
them and leaves behind

10:48.132 --> 10:49.500
a scrapbook saying
they were saved.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.335
We call him The Savior.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.973
What does he do to them, then?

10:56.039 --> 10:57.074
What does he do to them?

10:57.141 --> 10:59.143
He shoots them and
dumps their bodies.

11:05.682 --> 11:08.352
Does this mean
that Gabriel's dead?

11:08.419 --> 11:09.586
We don't know that yet.

11:10.721 --> 11:12.456
We're doing everything we can.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.463
No sightings yet.

11:19.530 --> 11:21.598
Humboldt Park, Englewood,
Oak Park, nothing.

11:22.801 --> 11:23.934
How's it going in there?

11:24.001 --> 11:26.470
She had like an anxiety
attack, poor girl.

11:26.537 --> 11:28.105
Think she's gonna be
okay to do this now?

11:28.172 --> 11:29.273
Relatively speaking.

11:31.208 --> 11:31.843
Did you ask her?

11:31.910 --> 11:33.143
Ah, Jesus, come on.

11:33.210 --> 11:34.211
You didn't ask her.

11:36.547 --> 11:38.215
Hi.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.416
I'm Detective Byers.

11:39.483 --> 11:41.018
Please, have a seat.

11:49.726 --> 11:50.762
I, uh...

11:50.829 --> 11:53.497
I'm very sorry for
what happened to you.

11:53.564 --> 11:57.334
I have a question for you
that might seem a little odd.

11:58.770 --> 12:03.674
I have this theory that The
Savior might be targeting people

12:04.809 --> 12:07.244
who have attempted
suicide in the past.

12:09.346 --> 12:10.614
What?

12:10.681 --> 12:14.351
Two out of the three
victims have suicide attempts.

12:14.418 --> 12:16.520
It's the only link
we have between them.

12:16.587 --> 12:18.555
It's an
unproven theory.

12:18.622 --> 12:23.227
Rebecca, did Gabriel
ever try to kill himself?

12:26.363 --> 12:27.464
Yes.

12:27.531 --> 12:28.398
Yeah.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.367
He did.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.704
I run a suicide
prevention group.

12:35.272 --> 12:36.507
That's where we met.

12:36.573 --> 12:38.108
He came in one day

12:38.175 --> 12:39.811
after my group session.

12:39.878 --> 12:42.780
I'm Dr. Church, you can call
me Rebecca, I run the group.

12:42.847 --> 12:43.714
I'm Gabriel.

12:45.749 --> 12:47.518
Um, what's up?

12:49.419 --> 12:50.254
I...

12:51.890 --> 12:57.060
My wife and daughter
died last year and...

12:59.663 --> 13:00.597
And I'm just...

13:03.835 --> 13:05.202
Just start talking.

13:05.269 --> 13:06.103
You can do that.

13:12.175 --> 13:13.544
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

13:14.846 --> 13:16.113
Just wait.

13:17.815 --> 13:19.283
Just wait, please!

13:23.487 --> 13:24.756
What's that?

13:24.822 --> 13:25.757
It's my number.

13:26.858 --> 13:28.826
I can tell there's
more you need to say.

13:28.893 --> 13:29.761
Thank you.

13:33.898 --> 13:35.632
People come and
go every night.

13:37.869 --> 13:40.737
I never thought
I'd hear from him.

13:54.484 --> 13:55.686
- Hello?
- Rebecca.

13:55.753 --> 13:58.288
Hi, you know, after
I saw you tonight

13:58.355 --> 14:00.591
I think something
clicked for me.

14:00.657 --> 14:02.927
I think I'm actually really
starting to feel better.

14:02.994 --> 14:04.328
This is Gabriel, by the way.

14:04.394 --> 14:06.229
Uh, yeah, I know.

14:07.230 --> 14:08.332
Are you feeling manic?

14:08.398 --> 14:09.767
No, no.

14:09.834 --> 14:13.236
I actually feel relaxed.

14:13.303 --> 14:15.739
He
seemed so positive.

14:15.807 --> 14:19.209
He asked me to have
coffee and I said no,

14:19.276 --> 14:22.379
but he was so
persistent so I agreed

14:22.446 --> 14:23.614
just to check in on him.

14:26.516 --> 14:28.518
He was
already following him.

14:32.255 --> 14:33.457
Then what happened?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.761
He offered
to make me breakfast.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.798
He wasn't a patient,
so I agreed.

14:42.499 --> 14:44.401
We had a lot in common.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.370
We both had losses in our lives.

14:47.571 --> 14:50.173
Be prepared to be amazed.

14:53.410 --> 14:56.413
I'm just so freaking
sick of being depressed.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.482
I mean, life is short, right?

14:58.548 --> 15:00.450
I don't know, I think I'm
just having some sort of

15:01.418 --> 15:02.820
positive epiphany.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.721
Is that normal?

15:04.789 --> 15:07.357
Sometimes people
just turn a corner.

15:07.424 --> 15:08.291
It can happen.

15:09.961 --> 15:10.862
I think it did.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.598
And I've done a little
research on you, too.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.836
You've written a lot
about suicide prevention.

15:18.903 --> 15:20.972
Most of that's from
my doctoral research.

15:21.039 --> 15:22.807
For insomniacs it works wonders.

15:24.307 --> 15:27.845
I read an article, they
called you The Wounded Healer.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.650
I can tell you still carry
around a lot of that sadness.

15:36.087 --> 15:37.789
Do you mind if I use...

15:37.855 --> 15:38.990
Oh yeah, sure, go ahead.

15:39.057 --> 15:41.324
Just right on the corner.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.444
Thanks, bye.

16:04.614 --> 16:06.616
Hi, sorry, I just
had a work call.

16:07.819 --> 16:09.686
So, what do you
do for work anyway?

16:10.822 --> 16:11.923
I'm an option trader.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.593
Which basically means I
steal money for a living.

16:18.029 --> 16:19.496
Oh, these were, uh...

16:20.597 --> 16:22.332
These were designed
to hold guitars.

16:23.768 --> 16:27.839
I planned on learning, but
with marriage and my kid

16:27.905 --> 16:30.640
and work, I never
even bought a guitar.

16:32.609 --> 16:34.611
You know what? The
new Gabe is retiring.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.915
Fuck options trading,
I've got enough money.

16:39.851 --> 16:42.452
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
keep dumping on you like this,

16:42.519 --> 16:43.386
it's just...

16:46.723 --> 16:49.659
I wanna buy guitars, I
wanna eat great food,

16:51.528 --> 16:54.832
and do whatever the else I
want for the rest of my life.

16:54.899 --> 16:57.935
I don't know, it
just kind of happened.

16:58.002 --> 17:01.404
We were inseparable
after that day.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.342
We just got engaged yesterday.

17:05.407 --> 17:06.542
Is there anything
else you can remember?

17:06.609 --> 17:07.577
Anything you can tell us?

17:07.644 --> 17:11.048
This guy followed
Gabriel for months.

17:11.115 --> 17:12.648
You are all over this thing.

17:15.484 --> 17:16.419
Wait a second.

17:16.486 --> 17:18.622
I mean, we're
sleeping here, so...

17:18.688 --> 17:20.490
The Savior was inside my house?

17:20.557 --> 17:22.894
Yes, he's done that with
a few of the other victims.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.128
He slips in and
takes these photos.

17:25.195 --> 17:26.563
I remember this night.

17:29.033 --> 17:31.836
It was at my place, it was
before I moved in with Gabriel.

17:31.903 --> 17:33.537
Maybe our fifth date.

18:18.115 --> 18:20.852
Did you leave the door open?

18:20.918 --> 18:22.186
- No.
- It was open.

18:29.626 --> 18:31.028
Hello?

18:47.912 --> 18:50.915
So, I always ask my group
what are you grateful for today?

18:52.049 --> 18:54.852
I just figured that it
was an angry patient

18:54.919 --> 18:58.055
or a twisted practical joke.

18:58.956 --> 18:59.824
But it was him.

19:01.092 --> 19:03.693
He's never left notes
before, why would he start?

19:03.761 --> 19:05.796
- Yeah.
- I've been in this career

19:06.931 --> 19:08.698
my entire life.

19:10.034 --> 19:11.135
Maybe I know him.

19:45.970 --> 19:46.837
What?

19:48.638 --> 19:49.439
What is it? What's the matter?

19:49.506 --> 19:51.075
It's the guy with the camera.

19:52.575 --> 19:53.778
This isn't possible.

19:53.844 --> 19:54.912
- Is he a patient?
- No, he's...

19:54.979 --> 19:56.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:58.648 --> 20:01.786
He's dead.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.187
We used to work together.

20:05.756 --> 20:07.158
Rebecca?

20:07.224 --> 20:08.558
Victor. Victor Quinn.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.760
I'm starting today.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.095
Yeah, welcome aboard.

20:11.162 --> 20:11.996
Thanks.

20:16.968 --> 20:19.804
No, I can imagine what it's
like for you, all right?

20:19.870 --> 20:23.174
But I'm here and I'm
listening, and right now it...

20:23.240 --> 20:25.542
Please, Henry, I'm still
listening, all right?

20:25.608 --> 20:28.212
I'm still here, we don't
have to figure this...

20:28.279 --> 20:31.015
He's in his garage
with the car started.

20:31.082 --> 20:34.118
Henry, Henry, I need you to
get out of the garage, okay?

20:35.219 --> 20:36.120
Henry!

20:36.187 --> 20:37.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:37.687 --> 20:39.256
Call 9-1-1.

20:41.092 --> 20:43.160
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, this is Victor Quinn,

20:43.227 --> 20:45.096
I'm at Chicago West Clinic.

20:45.162 --> 20:48.598
Subject is a male, he's in his
garage with his car started.

20:52.837 --> 20:54.138
Hey, that's all we can do.

20:55.106 --> 20:56.240
They'll get there, okay?

20:56.307 --> 20:57.174
Yeah.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.979
But so often
there just isn't enough time.

21:03.114 --> 21:04.647
You're fucking kidding me!

21:14.191 --> 21:15.760
This is fucking ridiculous.

21:15.826 --> 21:17.228
Jesus, I could've saved
that guy if the cops

21:17.294 --> 21:18.329
just got off their ass.

21:18.396 --> 21:19.897
Sometimes the cops
get there in time,

21:19.964 --> 21:21.966
sometimes they don't.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.067
It's how it goes.

21:34.879 --> 21:36.579
Victor was missing the next day.

21:45.022 --> 21:45.856
Hello?

21:47.291 --> 21:49.026
Victor, where are you?

21:59.370 --> 22:00.404
What are you doing?

22:00.471 --> 22:02.039
Apologizing.

22:06.377 --> 22:10.181
There are two people
buried here that I failed.

22:10.247 --> 22:13.150
And 15 others scattered
across the city.

22:13.217 --> 22:14.985
Some I talked to for hours.

22:17.254 --> 22:18.789
Some just once.

22:18.856 --> 22:21.192
You probably think
I'm crazy, right?

22:21.258 --> 22:24.929
I just think you need to
lighten up a little bit.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.030
Let's get outta here.

22:27.031 --> 22:27.898
Yeah.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.304
My boss thought
I could help him.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.208
Be careful.

22:38.976 --> 22:42.113
I think this is the first
time that oven's been used.

22:42.179 --> 22:43.214
This is my mom's recipe,

22:43.280 --> 22:45.316
she used to make them
when I was little.

22:45.382 --> 22:47.218
When she killed herself
I used to make 'em

22:47.284 --> 22:49.753
and they would just always
make me feel better.

22:50.921 --> 22:54.624
What was it like, you
know, after she died?

22:57.161 --> 22:58.162
Well, uh...

22:59.430 --> 23:02.266
I moved in with my dad
who was an abusive drunk.

23:04.368 --> 23:05.302
Not a good guy.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.108
Anyway, uh...

23:11.175 --> 23:13.844
I take my meds and I
feel like I've beaten it

23:13.911 --> 23:15.379
by helping other people.

23:15.446 --> 23:19.083
Yeah, you wanna help
people, you can't just try.

23:19.150 --> 23:21.051
I mean, you have to
succeed, you have to.

23:24.922 --> 23:27.158
What's in here?

23:34.798 --> 23:37.368
They're the people I've
lost over the last 20 years.

23:48.979 --> 23:51.515
Some nights I don't
sleep 'cause there's

23:51.582 --> 23:54.485
still so much I need to
learn about helping people.

23:54.552 --> 23:56.820
I, uh, called
your last employer.

23:58.222 --> 24:00.758
They said you were fired for
getting fixated on callers.

24:00.824 --> 24:03.861
You see, why is it so hard
for people to understand

24:04.828 --> 24:06.163
I was trying to save them-

24:06.230 --> 24:08.232
- I get it, I love your passion.

24:08.299 --> 24:11.268
But if you step out of line,
Victor, I will not keep quiet.

24:13.904 --> 24:14.772
Fine.

24:17.508 --> 24:19.977
I begged the
clinic to fire Victor,

24:20.044 --> 24:21.111
but nobody listened.

24:24.348 --> 24:25.349
I'm done.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.150
Please
calm down, Maggie,

24:26.217 --> 24:27.785
I'm listening, all right?

24:27.851 --> 24:29.053
I'm still here!

24:29.119 --> 24:30.854
Are you still there?

24:35.326 --> 24:37.061
I'm tired.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.431
Fuck it...

24:41.365 --> 24:43.234
I'm gonna do it.

24:43.300 --> 24:47.905
Hold on.

24:47.972 --> 24:49.340
What are you doing?

24:49.406 --> 24:51.041
She's right around the corner.

24:51.108 --> 24:52.076
Are you crazy?

24:52.142 --> 24:54.111
Either you're
in or you're out.

24:55.346 --> 24:57.114
Let's go.

24:57.181 --> 24:59.083
I'm calling 911.

25:14.398 --> 25:15.266
Maggie!

25:18.569 --> 25:19.436
Oh shit.

25:26.377 --> 25:29.380
Maggie, you
need hospitalization.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.514
I'm so stupid.

25:30.581 --> 25:33.284
I stopped taking my
medications a month ago.

25:34.618 --> 25:37.521
The second I kicked out the
chair I knew I made a mistake.

25:37.588 --> 25:39.590
What medications were you on?

25:39.657 --> 25:40.257
I don't even know.

25:40.324 --> 25:41.392
It was a new one.

25:43.260 --> 25:46.397
Just promise me you're
gonna get help now.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.264
For real.

25:47.331 --> 25:48.198
I will.

25:53.404 --> 25:56.473
I've spoken to him so many
times, but never met him.

25:58.676 --> 26:02.012
I'll go to the hospital, but
I wanna grab my journal first.

26:02.079 --> 26:02.946
Sure.

26:07.618 --> 26:11.422
See, this woman,
Rebecca, she needed help

26:11.488 --> 26:12.156
and I saved her.

26:14.058 --> 26:17.061
I mean, not the system. Me.

26:17.127 --> 26:18.996
Victor, you haven't
saved anybody,

26:19.063 --> 26:20.597
this is not about you.

26:21.465 --> 26:24.034
Maggie?

26:25.169 --> 26:26.503
God, where are the cops?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.308
Fuck.

26:31.375 --> 26:32.242
Maggie?

26:42.519 --> 26:44.021
No, no, no, no.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.839
I still regret every
single thing about that day.

27:06.477 --> 27:07.978
And Victor disappeared.

27:32.771 --> 27:36.106
Victor!

27:37.541 --> 27:40.411
Victor!

27:42.546 --> 27:44.114
God!

27:44.181 --> 27:46.116
Victor, I'm here.

27:46.183 --> 27:47.084
You're all right.

27:50.587 --> 27:53.090
I understand now
why people wanna die.

27:53.157 --> 27:55.225
I'm such a coward.

27:55.292 --> 27:56.693
Come on now, don't say that.

27:57.796 --> 27:59.596
I failed
so many people.

28:14.278 --> 28:15.612
My god, Victor.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.649
This is not your fault.

28:18.715 --> 28:22.319
I mean, you're blaming
yourself for things

28:23.420 --> 28:26.523
that are so far out
of your control.

28:26.590 --> 28:29.693
Let me take you on
as a client, okay?

28:29.761 --> 28:31.161
You'd do that for me?

28:31.228 --> 28:32.229
Of course.

28:41.505 --> 28:42.639
Come on, don't, don't-

28:42.706 --> 28:45.108
- No more of your bullshit!

28:46.543 --> 28:48.245
You know how many
I've told people

28:48.312 --> 28:50.714
"Everything's gonna be
okay" when I knew it wasn't?

28:50.782 --> 28:53.984
And to hell with all
your gratefulness spiel.

28:55.854 --> 29:00.157
I can see it in your eyes you
are just as fucked up as me.

29:00.224 --> 29:01.759
Please don't. Please.

29:01.826 --> 29:02.726
Stop it.

29:02.794 --> 29:03.727
It's all bullshit.

29:03.795 --> 29:05.295
Please don't.

29:05.362 --> 29:06.230
Please, Victor.

29:09.266 --> 29:10.133
Oh my god.

29:21.378 --> 29:23.647
Mr. Quinn is on a ventilator.

29:23.714 --> 29:26.283
His best case scenario is
that he's what's called

29:26.350 --> 29:28.719
a persistent vegetative state.

29:28.786 --> 29:32.422
But with his wounds he's
not gonna live very long.

29:34.558 --> 29:35.592
I'm very sorry.

29:37.594 --> 29:39.096
And when did this
all take place?

29:39.162 --> 29:40.765
About three years ago.

29:40.832 --> 29:44.268
If he's dead, how
is he in this photo?

29:44.334 --> 29:47.371
I have no idea, but it's him.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.639
Greg, check the hospitals
to see if and when

29:48.705 --> 29:50.240
this victim Quinn died.

29:50.307 --> 29:51.408
- On it.
- Let's roll some cars out

29:51.475 --> 29:53.277
to the last known address.

29:53.343 --> 29:55.445
You guys talk to
Chicago West Clinic.

29:55.512 --> 29:57.782
Canvas the whole area,
shop keepers, neighbors.

29:57.849 --> 29:59.750
This guy's on the move,
we don't have much time.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.405
So, the house that Victor
lived in is abandoned

30:21.471 --> 30:24.508
and the clinic that you
both worked at is shut down.

30:24.575 --> 30:27.144
But two years ago a
Victor Quinn applied

30:27.210 --> 30:30.414
for several jobs at multiple
suicide prevention clinics.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.817
Did Gabriel ever call
a suicide hotline?

30:36.921 --> 30:39.356
Honey, do you mind if
I move your sweaters?

30:39.423 --> 30:40.257
Sure, go ahead.

31:01.813 --> 31:03.213
What is this?

31:09.787 --> 31:11.254
After my family died

31:14.926 --> 31:16.894
I would stick this
under my chin.

31:20.464 --> 31:22.265
I've been meaning
to get rid of it.

31:30.842 --> 31:34.678
You know, I almost
actually did it one night.

31:35.947 --> 31:40.651
I called one of those
suicide prevention hotlines.

31:41.819 --> 31:44.154
Talked to this guy, he
talked me out of it.

31:45.522 --> 31:46.356
Saved my life.

31:51.495 --> 31:53.163
I don't even know who he was.

31:56.633 --> 31:59.236
That had to have
been Victor Quinn.

31:59.302 --> 32:00.270
Possibly.

32:00.337 --> 32:01.072
Why haven't you
guys found him yet?

32:01.139 --> 32:02.639
You have a picture of him.

32:02.706 --> 32:03.908
We're doing everything we can.

32:03.975 --> 32:04.976
And what can I do?

32:05.043 --> 32:06.077
Go home, get some rest.

32:06.144 --> 32:08.445
If you want I can
provide a police escort,

32:08.512 --> 32:11.682
but you really don't
need to stay here.

32:11.748 --> 32:13.183
Ma'am, come on.

32:55.492 --> 32:58.228
What are you doing here?

33:01.999 --> 33:03.801
Dad, when Chicago
West shut down I think

33:03.868 --> 33:05.335
they sent some of my stuff here.

33:05.402 --> 33:08.072
Notebooks, papers.
Do you remember that?

33:08.139 --> 33:10.507
Christ, you are your
mother's daughter.

33:12.409 --> 33:13.878
Do you have any of the stuff?

33:19.416 --> 33:21.685
Give me your hand, honey.

33:22.652 --> 33:23.620
I'm leaving.

33:23.687 --> 33:27.825
Your box
is in the basement.

34:30.087 --> 34:31.822
Have you spoken with
the dead before, Rebecca?

34:31.889 --> 34:32.989
Victor.

34:33.056 --> 34:35.960
I knew you'd figure
it out sooner or later.

34:36.027 --> 34:37.027
You're smart.

34:37.094 --> 34:39.728
I want you to know
that I know that.

34:39.797 --> 34:41.464
Where is Gabriel?

34:42.233 --> 34:43.868
He's sleeping.

34:43.935 --> 34:45.803
He can't come to
the phone right now.

34:49.239 --> 34:50.107
Why are you doing this?

34:50.174 --> 34:52.409
Because I survived.

35:00.017 --> 35:02.619
They said I was in a
coma from brain bleeding.

35:05.990 --> 35:07.758
They said I was
lucky to be alive.

35:08.793 --> 35:10.427
Lucky.

35:10.493 --> 35:13.496
For 100 days I
couldn't move or speak,

35:14.232 --> 35:15.565
but I could feel pain.

35:16.801 --> 35:17.902
I was locked in.

35:19.502 --> 35:23.140
100 days of agony,
misery, and suffering.

35:23.207 --> 35:25.176
Help me, help me.

35:25.243 --> 35:25.843
Help me.

35:28.179 --> 35:29.881
I'm in... I'm in here!

35:29.947 --> 35:30.982
Can you hear me?

35:31.048 --> 35:34.018
100 days to be tortured
by those I failed.

35:34.085 --> 35:36.921
- I couldn't do it.
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

35:42.659 --> 35:43.895
You failed us.

35:45.796 --> 35:47.564
- You failed us.
- You failed us.

35:47.631 --> 35:49.867
- You failed us.
- Failed us.

35:49.934 --> 35:51.135
You failed us.

35:51.202 --> 35:53.536
You failed us, you failed us.

35:53.603 --> 35:55.806
You failed us, you failed us.

35:55.873 --> 36:00.811
You failed us, you failed us.

36:02.579 --> 36:03.814
Then I woke up.

36:13.157 --> 36:14.892
Something changed inside of me.

36:24.101 --> 36:26.703
Hey, looking good, Mr. Quinn.

36:26.771 --> 36:28.139
You just keep on going, okay?

36:30.274 --> 36:31.508
Okay.

36:31.574 --> 36:34.111
Just, I'll see you around.

36:40.184 --> 36:42.853
And I grew stronger.

36:47.224 --> 36:50.061
One day I met a
woman named Barbara.

36:51.728 --> 36:52.930
I'm waiting for a room.

36:54.098 --> 36:55.800
We're all waiting
on something.

36:58.970 --> 37:03.908
I see what you did there.

37:06.243 --> 37:08.712
I'm going to hell.

37:08.779 --> 37:10.014
Yes, you are.

37:13.150 --> 37:14.484
Who are you?

37:15.585 --> 37:17.788
I have a solution
for people like you.

37:18.823 --> 37:20.157
To fix your defective brain.

37:22.726 --> 37:23.995
What are you doing?

37:24.061 --> 37:24.862
Get away from her.

37:24.929 --> 37:26.097
Get back to your room, let's go.

37:26.163 --> 37:27.198
I'll see you again.

37:27.264 --> 37:27.965
Let's go.

37:28.032 --> 37:29.666
- I promise.
- Now.

37:29.733 --> 37:30.935
Let's go, move it.

37:40.710 --> 37:42.780
Where is Gabriel?

37:42.847 --> 37:44.281
He's gonna be just fine.

37:46.083 --> 37:46.984
She talked to him.

37:47.051 --> 37:49.286
Victor Quinn is alive.

37:49.353 --> 37:51.322
I want Victor's phone pinged!

37:51.389 --> 37:52.990
Get that girl back in here.

37:53.057 --> 37:54.291
Cap, I'm showing her.

37:58.929 --> 38:01.531
The woman that Victor said
he met at the hospital...

38:02.333 --> 38:04.869
Did he say her name was Barbara?

38:04.935 --> 38:05.803
Yeah.

38:07.204 --> 38:10.107
His first victim.
Barbara Peters.

38:12.675 --> 38:14.378
We weren't sure how they met.

38:17.214 --> 38:21.684
After she left the hospital
he took her in broad daylight.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.854
He left that by the steps.

38:24.989 --> 38:26.723
What did he do to her?

38:36.233 --> 38:38.135
This is how we found her.

38:38.202 --> 38:40.204
My god, Victor.

38:40.271 --> 38:42.239
Next victim. Tanya Williams.

38:51.916 --> 38:55.352
The same drug was
found in her system.

38:55.419 --> 38:58.856
A boy in her apartment
complex found this.

39:08.966 --> 39:10.367
We found her the next morning.

39:13.170 --> 39:14.205
Seven months later.

39:15.239 --> 39:18.008
Harry Parker was leaving work.

39:20.444 --> 39:22.980
The cleaning people found
this next to his car.

39:25.216 --> 39:26.117
That's how we found him.

39:29.353 --> 39:31.621
Victor is angry
at suicidal people,

39:32.756 --> 39:35.359
so he's killing those
with suicide attempts.

39:35.426 --> 39:37.962
I'm gonna share
something with you

39:38.028 --> 39:39.330
that we haven't made public.

39:43.267 --> 39:47.338
All of these victims were
followed exactly for 100 days.

39:51.909 --> 39:53.978
Victor was in a
coma for 100 days.

39:54.044 --> 39:56.981
We were stumped on that,
that's why I'm showing you these.

40:00.317 --> 40:01.185
Yeah?

40:03.787 --> 40:04.522
Be right there.

40:04.588 --> 40:05.923
We might have a sighting.

40:08.225 --> 40:10.394
He's got multiple cell phones.

40:10.461 --> 40:12.830
Give me something good, Captain.

40:12.897 --> 40:14.131
It wasn't him.

40:14.198 --> 40:15.032
False alarm.

40:15.099 --> 40:15.732
- Shit.
- Hey, you let her

40:15.799 --> 40:16.600
in the evidence room?

40:16.666 --> 40:17.268
- What are you-
- Calm down,

40:17.334 --> 40:18.102
she knows the guy.

40:18.169 --> 40:19.770
Captain?

40:19.837 --> 40:20.304
Easy.

40:21.338 --> 40:23.841
Everyone shut up.

40:27.011 --> 40:28.479
I hope your police
friends are getting off

40:28.546 --> 40:29.980
on our relationship.

40:30.047 --> 40:30.915
Victor.

40:32.283 --> 40:36.387
Please, whatever
you're doing just...

40:36.453 --> 40:37.454
Please don't hurt him.

40:38.489 --> 40:40.124
I'll do whatever you want.

40:40.191 --> 40:42.793
I've been following
Gabriel for months.

40:42.860 --> 40:44.395
Watched him fall
in love with you.

40:46.163 --> 40:48.999
So, even though it's
against my rules

40:49.066 --> 40:51.202
I wanted you to get a goodbye.

40:53.103 --> 40:55.940
After all, it's the least I
can do for an old colleague.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.175
Victor.

40:58.242 --> 41:02.046
Wherever you are, just
listen to me, okay?

41:02.980 --> 41:03.847
You're right.

41:04.915 --> 41:08.519
The police, they're
listening to this,

41:08.586 --> 41:10.254
but I won't involve them, okay?

41:11.422 --> 41:12.957
Just come get me, all right?

41:13.857 --> 41:15.259
- I promise I-
- Shut up!

41:16.527 --> 41:17.995
Just answer my questions.

41:20.631 --> 41:22.433
Do you love Gabriel?

41:24.868 --> 41:28.973
Yes. Yes, more than
anything in the world.

41:29.039 --> 41:30.274
Is Gabriel strong?

41:33.644 --> 41:35.879
Yes.

41:35.946 --> 41:37.348
Is Gabriel happy?

41:40.184 --> 41:41.051
Yes.

41:42.319 --> 41:44.488
This isn't personal, Rebecca.

41:46.957 --> 41:47.791
Please.

42:01.305 --> 42:02.506
Victor, Victor.

42:03.907 --> 42:05.276
Are you there?

42:07.044 --> 42:08.212
He's not there.

42:09.546 --> 42:10.948
He's not there.

44:00.224 --> 44:03.494
She said yes.

44:03.560 --> 44:07.664
I wanna buy guitars, I
wanna eat great food,

44:07.731 --> 44:10.901
and do whatever else I want
for the rest of my life.

44:26.617 --> 44:29.153
Jack, I just
realized something.

44:29.219 --> 44:30.320
I need a big favor.

44:32.656 --> 44:34.291
Thank you, you guys.

44:34.358 --> 44:35.225
Good week.

44:45.736 --> 44:47.604
Look at these pictures.

44:47.671 --> 44:49.206
Barbara

44:49.273 --> 44:50.307
Tanya

44:50.374 --> 44:51.241
Harry

44:52.209 --> 44:53.444
and Gabriel.

44:53.510 --> 44:54.478
What do you notice?

44:58.182 --> 44:59.283
They're happy, Jack.

44:59.349 --> 45:00.484
Look at their faces.

45:16.133 --> 45:18.435
Every one of them that
was murdered had recovered

45:18.502 --> 45:20.437
in the months before
they were killed.

45:31.248 --> 45:34.786
People who are deeply suicidal,
they usually never recover

45:34.853 --> 45:36.587
like this, and these people did.

45:38.155 --> 45:40.290
Victor isn't killing them
because they're suicidal,

45:40.357 --> 45:42.493
Victor's killing them
because they beat it.

45:43.694 --> 45:44.929
Think about it, all right?

45:44.995 --> 45:47.331
You were there, you heard
the phone conversation.

45:47.397 --> 45:50.567
Why else would Victor
ask if Gabriel was happy?

45:50.634 --> 45:52.202
Happy?

45:52.269 --> 45:53.103
That's what you got?

45:54.671 --> 45:58.208
Okay, I need you to
listen to me very carefully.

45:58.275 --> 46:00.477
Do not go around town
sniffing out clues

46:00.544 --> 46:03.614
and asking victim's families
questions without me.

47:18.422 --> 47:20.257
Long time no see.

47:47.885 --> 47:49.653
Should've left it
alone, Rebecca.

47:55.626 --> 47:58.261
Had to go and play
detective, didn't you?

47:58.328 --> 47:59.196
Rebecca?

48:00.430 --> 48:01.264
Rebecca!

48:07.704 --> 48:09.206
I know your secret.

48:11.742 --> 48:13.276
I'm gonna save you next.

48:18.950 --> 48:21.618
Fuck.

48:21.685 --> 48:23.520
Jack, come on.

48:23.587 --> 48:24.321
Come on.

48:24.388 --> 48:25.322
He's got my gear.

48:25.389 --> 48:28.158
It doesn't
matter, we gotta go.

48:57.855 --> 48:59.791
Is there something
you're not telling me?

49:01.959 --> 49:05.429
I mean, why is Victor
coming after you now?

49:12.436 --> 49:14.705
Gabriel, are you sleeping?

49:49.974 --> 49:51.776
What are you doing?

49:53.778 --> 49:54.644
Babe.

49:55.579 --> 49:56.848
Are you okay?

50:00.684 --> 50:02.285
Hey, what's wrong?

50:06.090 --> 50:09.861
When I was 18 I took
40 sleeping pills.

50:11.829 --> 50:16.666
I woke up in a pool of
vomit completely ashamed.

50:18.468 --> 50:23.241
But then I did it again in
grad school two years ago.

50:24.541 --> 50:25.408
Babe, I'm cursed.

50:26.743 --> 50:31.281
Even when things are going
great, I get really down.

50:32.415 --> 50:33.918
I still hate myself for it.

50:35.052 --> 50:37.054
Don't do that to
yourself. Don't.

50:39.456 --> 50:41.993
He's out
there. I know it.

50:51.836 --> 50:56.841
I think it's time to move
you to a safe house now.

50:57.641 --> 50:58.075
No, I wanna stay here.

51:01.611 --> 51:02.980
This is where I feel safe.

51:06.716 --> 51:07.584
Okay.

51:08.886 --> 51:10.320
Let's make it safe here.

51:23.000 --> 51:23.968
Wa-la.

51:24.035 --> 51:26.003
Your apartment is
now your safe house

51:26.070 --> 51:27.604
and I'm the gatekeeper.

51:27.671 --> 51:29.739
I have units downstairs
in 20 minutes.

51:59.971 --> 52:01.438
Jesus!

52:01.504 --> 52:04.441
Rebecca, don't sneak
up on me like that.

52:04.507 --> 52:05.877
What is it?

52:05.943 --> 52:07.078
I was thinking about it.

52:07.144 --> 52:10.214
How did Victor know that
I tried to kill myself?

52:10.281 --> 52:11.782
Maybe Gabriel told Victor.

52:11.849 --> 52:13.483
No, no.

52:13.550 --> 52:15.452
That doesn't make any sense.

52:15.518 --> 52:17.755
Okay, so when Gabriel
called the suicide hotline

52:17.822 --> 52:19.656
we didn't even know each other.

52:19.723 --> 52:21.225
Look, I don't know about
the where, when, hows,

52:21.292 --> 52:24.561
all I know is I'm
catching him, that's it.

52:25.729 --> 52:26.696
No, no.

52:26.764 --> 52:27.697
Victor...

52:28.698 --> 52:30.533
He's trying to
tell me something.

52:33.971 --> 52:35.472
Who is that?

52:35.538 --> 52:37.041
It's an email from Victor.

52:38.075 --> 52:40.011
Do you understand yet?

52:40.077 --> 52:41.846
This is why I'm The Savior.

52:42.980 --> 52:45.016
He attached audio
files to this email.

52:46.650 --> 52:47.818
I'm gonna play the file.

52:51.956 --> 52:53.224
Hey, doc,
yeah, I'm on a first date

52:53.291 --> 52:57.061
with that girl I told you
about who gave me her number.

52:57.128 --> 52:59.529
This is a recording
of a phone call.

52:59.596 --> 53:01.498
I know, start it over.

53:03.067 --> 53:05.502
Uh, do you mind if I use...

53:05.568 --> 53:06.370
Oh yeah, sure, go ahead.

53:06.436 --> 53:08.906
It's just right on the corner.

53:26.690 --> 53:28.025
Gabriel.

53:28.092 --> 53:30.694
Yeah, I'm on a first date
with that girl I told you about.

53:30.761 --> 53:34.165
The one I met last night
who gave me her number.

53:35.132 --> 53:36.867
I am just so nervous.

53:40.805 --> 53:42.039
I'm not sure if I can do this.

53:42.106 --> 53:44.108
Just be yourself.

53:44.175 --> 53:46.743
If she's a counselor,
she'll understand.

53:47.711 --> 53:49.479
Okay, all right. Thanks.

53:51.015 --> 53:52.817
Hi, sorry, I just
had a work call.

53:54.318 --> 53:55.685
Play the next one.

54:02.326 --> 54:03.828
You know, this is
my investment manager.

54:03.894 --> 54:05.262
I'll be right back.

54:05.329 --> 54:05.930
Hello?

54:05.997 --> 54:07.198
How's it going.

54:07.264 --> 54:09.166
Fifth date in seven days.

54:09.233 --> 54:11.836
This woman is incredible.

54:11.902 --> 54:13.037
She really is amazing.

54:14.805 --> 54:18.809
I don't know, do you think
I'm really ready for this?

54:18.876 --> 54:20.945
You sound
like a man in love.

54:22.279 --> 54:26.150
If you get anxious,
just breathe, relax.

54:28.352 --> 54:29.353
Okay, will do.

54:29.420 --> 54:30.720
Thanks, doc.

54:30.788 --> 54:32.990
Talk to you later.

54:39.063 --> 54:40.798
Play the next one.

54:46.037 --> 54:47.604
Gabriel.

54:47.670 --> 54:49.273
Hey, doc.
You got a second?

54:49.340 --> 54:51.608
Sure, what's going on?

54:51.674 --> 54:54.812
Oh, Rebecca's been
real down lately.

54:55.678 --> 54:56.480
Just trying to cheer her up,

54:56.546 --> 54:58.082
get her out in nature, you know?

54:59.216 --> 55:01.152
Nice work,
I'm proud of you.

55:01.218 --> 55:04.088
Thanks for always making me
appreciate stuff like this.

55:07.958 --> 55:09.659
I get more out of your
pleasure than you know.

55:16.367 --> 55:17.567
Play the last one.

55:20.171 --> 55:21.038
Guess what?

55:23.407 --> 55:26.010
I'm gonna ask her
to move in with me.

55:26.077 --> 55:27.610
I really think I can do this.

55:29.413 --> 55:30.613
She's the one.

55:30.680 --> 55:34.285
Tell me, does Rebecca
know you're speaking to me?

55:34.351 --> 55:35.319
No.

55:35.386 --> 55:36.454
No, she has no idea.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.722
I don't wanna shatter
her confidence in me.

55:45.129 --> 55:47.597
Victor helps them
and then he kills them.

55:50.501 --> 55:52.770
Gabriel was so vulnerable

55:54.238 --> 55:56.841
and he didn't want me to know.

56:49.260 --> 56:51.128
Since you're
hiding behind the police,

56:51.195 --> 56:52.363
I thought we could chat.

56:54.064 --> 56:54.932
You see now?

56:55.966 --> 56:56.901
I want you to
understand that I didn't

56:56.967 --> 56:59.203
kill Gabriel because
he was happy.

57:00.871 --> 57:03.107
I'm the reason he was happy.

57:03.174 --> 57:04.208
Him and the others.

57:05.176 --> 57:06.010
All me.

57:07.111 --> 57:09.746
And why
do you kill all them?

57:09.813 --> 57:11.248
You should come
see me, Rebecca.

57:12.516 --> 57:13.484
I can help you.

57:13.551 --> 57:15.152
Yeah, I should.

57:16.287 --> 57:17.955
Give me your address so
the fucking SWAT team

57:18.022 --> 57:19.356
can put you where you belong.

57:21.192 --> 57:22.359
You want my address.

57:23.294 --> 57:25.095
I assume it's in
Gabriel's diary.

57:25.162 --> 57:26.897
Gabriel didn't keep a diary.

57:26.964 --> 57:30.034
As his therapist, I
can assure you he did.

57:31.835 --> 57:33.971
Read the diary, Rebecca.

57:34.038 --> 57:37.675
It's on top of the
world, just like he was.

58:03.133 --> 58:05.502
Top of the world.

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:34.551
No!

01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:24.268
Months went by.

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:27.304
I was losing my mind.

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:42.619
I'm Dr. Church.

01:01:42.686 --> 01:01:44.588
You can call me Rebecca,
I run the group.

01:01:44.655 --> 01:01:45.556
It's my number.

01:01:48.158 --> 01:01:50.127
I can tell there's
more you need to say.

01:01:51.728 --> 01:01:52.563
Thanks.

01:02:02.807 --> 01:02:04.141
Here for Gabriel?

01:02:07.344 --> 01:02:09.046
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:16.453
Can you pull up, up, up,
up, over here, right.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.389
Just right in... just
right up here, please.

01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:20.324
Just...

01:02:46.149 --> 01:02:47.584
Suicide prevention,
this is Victor.

01:02:47.651 --> 01:02:49.219
I need some help.

01:02:50.721 --> 01:02:51.890
Calm down and
tell me where you are.

01:02:51.956 --> 01:02:57.027
I'm at, I'm at the
tracks near Humboldt Park.

01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:01.265
My name is Dr. Quinn, Gabriel.

01:03:01.331 --> 01:03:02.666
I'm coming to you right now.

01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:13.878
You sounded like you needed me.

01:03:13.945 --> 01:03:16.113
I can tell who's
serious and who isn't.

01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:18.448
You are.

01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:33.363
Where are we going?

01:03:34.766 --> 01:03:36.667
I'll take you to my house.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.268
I have something to show you.

01:03:39.336 --> 01:03:41.505
I'm not taking no for an answer.

01:03:57.321 --> 01:03:58.756
Please. Please, go ahead.

01:04:09.801 --> 01:04:10.667
Open it.

01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:26.216
Who are these people?

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.523
These were all deeply
suicidal people just like you.

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:35.125
Now look how happy they are.

01:04:37.494 --> 01:04:40.230
Look at the joy on their faces.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:41.465
I helped all of them.

01:04:42.733 --> 01:04:43.600
How?

01:04:49.807 --> 01:04:53.945
Imagine you only
had 100 days to live

01:04:54.012 --> 01:04:57.147
if you knew for sure that
you would die in 100 days.

01:04:59.549 --> 01:05:00.484
What do you mean?

01:05:01.618 --> 01:05:04.388
The reason all these
people are so happy

01:05:04.454 --> 01:05:07.290
is because they agreed
to die after 100 days.

01:05:09.994 --> 01:05:14.899
On the 100th day, I drug
them with sodium thiopental,

01:05:15.867 --> 01:05:16.733
and shoot them.

01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:19.202
Totally painless.

01:05:21.405 --> 01:05:26.410
And I photograph them,
capturing all their joy.

01:05:26.878 --> 01:05:28.112
Imagine...

01:05:28.178 --> 01:05:31.248
Imagine a life, a short
life, but full of passion,

01:05:31.314 --> 01:05:34.718
reckless abandon, adventure
with no consequence.

01:05:34.786 --> 01:05:36.753
The suicidal mind
is thus defeated.

01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:39.857
If you could have one
thing in the world

01:05:39.924 --> 01:05:43.360
that would make you
happy, what would it be?

01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:48.833
I wanna find love again.

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:53.771
Then join me and you will.

01:06:21.866 --> 01:06:22.934
All right, I'll do it.

01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:33.577
Hello?

01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:35.746
Rebecca, hi.

01:06:59.669 --> 01:07:01.505
I'm the reason he was happy.

01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:07.979
You ready?

01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:12.784
Yeah.

01:07:16.586 --> 01:07:17.755
Don't fight it.

01:07:17.822 --> 01:07:19.090
Easy.

01:07:19.157 --> 01:07:20.024
Easy.

01:07:28.598 --> 01:07:30.734
I have a solution
for people like you.

01:07:32.103 --> 01:07:34.638
- Yeah.
- To fix your defective brain.

01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:11.776
Leave me alone.

01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:35.497
You knew you were gonna die.

01:08:35.564 --> 01:08:37.835
How could you do that to me?

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:55.118
Why did you do this?

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:29.953
Rebecca?

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:34.624
Rebecca!

01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:37.560
Shit!

01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:42.767
Okay, girl. Come on, come on!

01:09:52.676 --> 01:09:54.045
Don't move.

01:09:54.111 --> 01:09:56.546
You'll be all right.

01:09:56.613 --> 01:09:57.815
You're lucky to be alive.

01:10:18.769 --> 01:10:19.870
We've read the diary.

01:10:21.339 --> 01:10:24.574
We know that Gabriel and
all the other victims

01:10:24.641 --> 01:10:28.212
made deals with Victor.

01:10:28.279 --> 01:10:29.981
Gabriel didn't really love me.

01:10:32.016 --> 01:10:32.883
I know.

01:10:34.285 --> 01:10:35.152
I'm so sorry.

01:10:37.989 --> 01:10:39.824
We're gonna get him now.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:40.724
No, you're not.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.228
No, people want
what he's selling.

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:47.164
People like me.

01:11:34.245 --> 01:11:35.980
Do it, do it, do it.

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.019
Good, you're awake.

01:11:45.423 --> 01:11:47.358
There are police
in this hospital.

01:11:47.425 --> 01:11:48.259
Then scream.

01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:54.198
That's what I thought.

01:11:57.234 --> 01:11:59.270
Did Gabriel ever try
to change his mind?

01:12:01.405 --> 01:12:02.239
Once.

01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:07.778
I just feel guilty
about Rebecca.

01:12:09.146 --> 01:12:12.883
She's head over heels, I
just feel like a bad person,

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:15.086
and I don't know if I
can go through with this.

01:12:16.454 --> 01:12:17.321
Then don't.

01:12:18.389 --> 01:12:21.759
I won't waste my
time on nonbelievers.

01:12:21.826 --> 01:12:24.795
I'm giving you a
taste of real life,

01:12:25.963 --> 01:12:27.798
but it's real only
because of your control.

01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:29.834
Your control is the key.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.002
Either you are in or you're out.

01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:37.640
You know your joy will pass.

01:12:41.479 --> 01:12:44.348
It always does, it always does.

01:12:51.155 --> 01:12:51.989
I'm in.

01:12:57.094 --> 01:12:58.628
Get her an engagement ring.

01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:03.267
You'll feel better
about yourself.

01:13:04.969 --> 01:13:06.237
I don't know who's worse.

01:13:07.538 --> 01:13:11.842
You or the victims who lie
to those who love them.

01:13:14.145 --> 01:13:15.146
You're blaming me?

01:13:18.449 --> 01:13:21.684
During the 100 days
you were with Gabriel,

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:25.990
did love ever save
you from the demons

01:13:26.056 --> 01:13:29.126
or did you still feel the
pang of emptiness you felt

01:13:29.193 --> 01:13:30.660
ever since you were a kid?

01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:33.230
Be honest now.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:36.066
I still feel empty.

01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:37.301
Because you are empty.

01:13:38.402 --> 01:13:39.270
Like me.

01:13:40.371 --> 01:13:42.739
He or you could never
escape the demons.

01:13:42.806 --> 01:13:44.707
I knew that from the
moment I met you.

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:48.745
What do you see when you
fantasize about death?

01:13:49.914 --> 01:13:51.448
That I'm drowning.

01:13:54.585 --> 01:13:56.753
I don't know what's
real anymore.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.789
I'm as real as
you're ever gonna get.

01:13:59.557 --> 01:14:02.293
I live so people
like us can die.

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:03.961
I'm your salvation, Rebecca.

01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:06.197
Get out.

01:14:28.452 --> 01:14:29.987
Hey.

01:14:30.054 --> 01:14:30.720
Hey, Jack.

01:14:30.788 --> 01:14:33.090
Uh, I got the flowers.

01:14:33.157 --> 01:14:35.025
They're really pretty.

01:14:35.092 --> 01:14:36.060
Yeah, thanks.

01:14:37.528 --> 01:14:40.464
Yeah, no, I'm doing
okay, you know?

01:14:40.531 --> 01:14:42.833
First day of the rest
of my life, right?

01:14:44.535 --> 01:14:46.403
Actually, I was wondering.

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:49.473
Would you wanna help me
do some spring cleaning?

01:14:50.608 --> 01:14:52.109
It'd be nice to
have the company.

01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:15.299
So, what's this?

01:15:18.369 --> 01:15:23.073
Gabriel and I, uh, we went
to Manhattan a few months ago.

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:34.385
Look, just don't
give up, okay?

01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:37.221
You're gonna be fine.

01:15:39.323 --> 01:15:40.157
I'm so tired.

01:15:40.224 --> 01:15:41.925
- Then get some rest.
- Yeah.

01:15:53.671 --> 01:15:55.339
I found my mom's body.

01:15:56.607 --> 01:15:59.910
She left me a rose, but no note.

01:16:25.069 --> 01:16:26.337
Are you okay?

01:16:26.403 --> 01:16:27.371
You were screaming.

01:16:28.472 --> 01:16:30.374
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:32.142
Look, I'm here for you
if you need me, okay?

01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:33.077
Just...

01:16:35.045 --> 01:16:36.013
Just leave, Jack.

01:16:44.988 --> 01:16:46.290
You know where to find me.

01:17:01.739 --> 01:17:06.477
They say when you
hit rock bottom you just know.

01:17:08.278 --> 01:17:11.115
At that moment, I knew.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.451
I was ready.

01:17:18.055 --> 01:17:19.123
Hello, Rebecca.

01:17:23.026 --> 01:17:24.027
I'm so tired.

01:17:26.697 --> 01:17:28.232
Take down my address.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.968
Don't be afraid.

01:19:04.394 --> 01:19:06.063
I'm happy you came.

01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:27.417
I was nervous.

01:19:29.586 --> 01:19:30.554
Don't be.

01:19:31.688 --> 01:19:33.323
You made the right choice.

01:19:39.797 --> 01:19:40.664
Oh.

01:19:43.801 --> 01:19:45.402
Come here.

01:19:45.469 --> 01:19:46.403
Come, come.

01:19:49.506 --> 01:19:51.642
You made the right choice.

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:18.836
I did make the right choice.

01:20:55.238 --> 01:20:56.139
It's lovely.

01:21:10.253 --> 01:21:11.321
Who called it in?

01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:13.457
An anonymous caller
said from this house.

01:21:21.498 --> 01:21:22.366
Oh, shit.

01:21:46.723 --> 01:21:47.557
What is it?

01:21:50.394 --> 01:21:51.228
Nothing.

01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:00.938
What am
I grateful for today?

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.344
Honestly, I don't know.

01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:14.786
But I am alive and I am strong

01:22:16.386 --> 01:22:19.589
and I know I am never
going to give up.

01:22:24.528 --> 01:22:25.395
I promise.
