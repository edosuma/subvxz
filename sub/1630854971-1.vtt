00:01.523 --> 00:03.220
<i>Previously on
"Superman and Lois"...</i>

00:03.220 --> 00:04.439
<i>Lana, there's something
I've wanted to tell you</i>

00:04.439 --> 00:06.963
<i>my entire life.</i>
- Clark is Superman.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.530
<i>You and your dad--</i>

00:08.530 --> 00:10.488
looking back,
it makes so much sense.

00:10.488 --> 00:13.448
We just kind of need to reset.
See how we feel?

00:13.448 --> 00:14.797
I'm not over that,

00:14.797 --> 00:17.930
and I don't know
that I ever will be.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.497
<i>I wanted
to talk to you about</i>

00:19.497 --> 00:20.977
<i>Bruno Mannheim,</i>

00:20.977 --> 00:22.370
the head of Intergang.

00:22.370 --> 00:23.980
On this planet, Bruno Mannheim

00:23.980 --> 00:26.591
was the person that killed
John Henry Irons.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.463
<i>Are you gonna try to build
another fortress?</i>

00:28.463 --> 00:31.553
<i>Yup, only this time,
it's for all of us.</i>

00:34.338 --> 00:38.473
<i>It's been 27 days
since the world almost ended--</i>

00:38.473 --> 00:41.737
<i>27 days since
everyone on two planets</i>

00:41.737 --> 00:44.609
<i>nearly had their lives
changed forever,</i>

00:44.609 --> 00:46.437
<i>and you know what?</i>

00:46.437 --> 00:49.527
<i>Because we all knew
what we were about to lose,</i>

00:49.527 --> 00:52.400
<i>because we all felt that fear,</i>

00:52.400 --> 00:54.489
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

01:06.457 --> 01:07.893
<i>A new fortress?</i>

01:07.893 --> 01:09.547
I thought it was time
to make one available

01:09.547 --> 01:11.114
to the whole family.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.376
Lois,

01:12.376 --> 01:14.248
Jordan,

01:14.248 --> 01:15.684
and Jonathan.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.732
<i>We decided we wanted change.</i>

01:20.732 --> 01:24.997
A place to use together
so every voice is heard,

01:24.997 --> 01:27.870
our soon-to-be...

01:27.870 --> 01:31.308
town hall!

01:32.657 --> 01:35.486
<i>We wanted to make
our lives better.</i>

01:42.537 --> 01:44.887
<i>Improve on
what already existed.</i>

01:53.548 --> 01:57.073
<i>And get rid
of what caused us grief.</i>

01:57.073 --> 01:59.989
Shut the mines down for good.

01:59.989 --> 02:03.601
<i>But what's become clear
in the last 27 days</i>

02:03.601 --> 02:05.168
<i>is that all of us</i>

02:05.168 --> 02:08.302
<i>around the globe--</i>

02:08.302 --> 02:09.651
<i>we're getting closer.</i>

02:22.620 --> 02:24.622
Wow.
- Yeah.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.711
We're gonna have to thank
Tal for the use of his villa.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.235
Yeah.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.627
It's gonna be
a little hard to do

02:29.627 --> 02:32.456
now that he's
on Bizarro world, but...

02:32.456 --> 02:34.502
You'll see him again, Clark.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.286
Yeah.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.637
Time to go already?

02:39.637 --> 02:40.986
The boys want to practice

02:40.986 --> 02:42.597
before we head back
to the "Gazette."

02:44.338 --> 02:45.730
Yeah,
I'm not gonna be there today.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.210
I have an appointment
in Metropolis.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.081
What?
Lois, Lois,

02:49.081 --> 02:51.083
John Henry said
to leave it alone.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.998
I know he did,
but this is Bruno Mannheim,

02:52.998 --> 02:55.175
leader of Intergang.
- Allegedly.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.960
I'm just saying--

02:57.960 --> 02:59.396
all the years
we've spent investigating him

02:59.396 --> 03:01.137
in Metropolis, we couldn't
make anything stick.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.660
Yeah, for a reason--

03:02.660 --> 03:05.054
bribery, extortion, intimidation.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.099
We couldn't get a single person
to say anything about

03:07.099 --> 03:10.712
the biggest illegal
weapons dealer in the country?

03:12.975 --> 03:14.411
Just be careful.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.934
Okay.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.200
- The boys again?
- I--

03:21.853 --> 03:23.377
- They're gonna have to wait.
- Yeah.

03:32.734 --> 03:36.564
Whoo!

03:52.884 --> 03:54.625
Won't catch me this time,
old man!

03:54.625 --> 03:56.148
Whoo-hoo!

04:03.808 --> 04:05.245
Whoo!

04:23.350 --> 04:26.614
Man, I'll tell ya, your flying
ability has really improved,

04:26.614 --> 04:30.879
but, uh, you got a ways to go
if this old man can beat you.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.968
Well, we gotta at least
bring a wet suit next time.

04:32.968 --> 04:37.146
I get soaked every time
I come here.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.756
Yeah, we might be able
to do something about that,

04:38.756 --> 04:40.802
but right now,
while I'm at work,

04:40.802 --> 04:43.326
I want you to spar.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.372
When you're done,

04:45.372 --> 04:46.416
fly home.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.725
Wait, by myself?

04:50.725 --> 04:51.769
Straight home.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.343
Okay, Jonathan,
both hands on the wheel.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.953
Yes, ma'am.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.955
Ten and two.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.305
- Yes, ma'am.
- You text and drive,

05:05.305 --> 05:07.698
you're done.
- Mom, I know.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.353
I should've
got Dad to help me.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.702
Your father is
a terrible driver.

05:11.702 --> 05:12.703
Let's go.

05:16.446 --> 05:17.621
Easy, easy.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.580
Nice and easy.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.409
Indicator--hit the indicator.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.193
Slow down, slow down.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.673
You can speed up.
You're tailgating.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.544
You're gonna hit that car!

05:27.544 --> 05:29.633
Mom, please.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.156
Sweetie, you can't
take your driver's test

05:31.156 --> 05:32.462
in this monstrosity.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.550
Let's practice again
in the morning

05:33.550 --> 05:34.551
in <i>my</i> car.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.079
<i>You know, now that
you're working for me,</i>

05:41.079 --> 05:42.994
you can come into the DOD--

05:42.994 --> 05:44.561
save us this trek
back and forth.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.693
I like it here.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.259
Besides, Nat's more qualified

05:47.259 --> 05:48.435
than anyone you've got.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.175
What if I get her clearance?

05:50.175 --> 05:51.612
She comes in with you.
- I want her hanging

05:51.612 --> 05:54.528
with high-school kids,
not DOD eggheads.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.138
She's gotta build
some new relationships.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.623
Nat,

06:02.623 --> 06:05.800
on your Earth,
I was your grandfather.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.931
We do anything fun?

06:06.931 --> 06:08.280
Watched horror movies.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.021
Every Friday night, yeah.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.240
No kidding?

06:11.240 --> 06:13.024
Like the one playing in town?

06:13.024 --> 06:14.112
"Slaughter Cabin 3"?

06:14.112 --> 06:16.071
Yeah, exactly like that.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.420
Well, let's go.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.642
If it's okay with you,
of course.

06:21.642 --> 06:22.947
Yeah.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.906
All right then.
It's a bloody date.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.390
Yeah, looks good to me
about right there.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.913
A few more of these
blood drives, and, uh,

06:31.913 --> 06:33.218
we'll be good on our reserves.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.438
- Hi, guys!
- Uh, hey, Lana.

06:37.135 --> 06:40.835
Um, listen, my lawyer's
been calling, and, uh,

06:40.835 --> 06:42.793
he says you hadn't signed
the divorce papers yet.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.969
Yeah, I know.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.275
Something
you don't agree with?

06:46.275 --> 06:49.104
No, no,
the terms are all fine.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.628
Okay, well, what is it?

06:51.628 --> 06:54.544
I have just been so slammed, Kyle.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.329
I mean, Dean left
such a huge, huge mess,

06:57.329 --> 06:59.331
and every time I sit down
to sign the papers--

06:59.331 --> 07:02.030
Mayor Lang,
we got a problem at the school.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.379
Something crazy just pops up.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.652
One more story.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.088
I'm done proofing
Lois' copy for you.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.568
Don't worry about the copy.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.048
I want you to cover
whatever's going on

07:20.048 --> 07:21.876
at the high school.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.626
I have to go.
Um, I'll be there

07:32.626 --> 07:33.670
as soon as I can.

07:35.063 --> 07:38.240
Sure, go save
whatever you're saving.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.077
Jordan?

07:50.948 --> 07:52.472
That's not gonna help.
Stop!

07:57.085 --> 07:58.086
No!

08:30.684 --> 08:32.424
I told you
to fly straight home.

08:32.424 --> 08:33.687
I got turned around.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.123
Turned around?
We were in Malaysia.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.255
Yes, I know,
but when I realized that,

08:37.255 --> 08:39.083
I saw what was happening,
and I came to help.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.303
Jordan, you disobeyed me.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.087
You put everyone in
the vicinity of that building

08:43.087 --> 08:45.525
in danger, and on top of that,
you almost revealed yourself

08:45.525 --> 08:46.830
to the entire world.
Do you understand--

08:46.830 --> 08:50.355
I had it under control.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.400
Home.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.749
Now.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.359
And unless
I tell you it's okay,

08:54.359 --> 08:56.187
never do that again.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.368
Is that black mold?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.935
Construction crew found it

09:04.935 --> 09:06.589
when they opened up
the wall yesterday.

09:06.589 --> 09:09.244
This stuff is so toxic.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.202
We'll have to hire someone
to come clean it up.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.553
I'm afraid this isn't from
what busted up the hallway.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.119
This is water damage.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
It's probably
been here for years.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.166
Um, I'll take it from here.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.646
- Oh.
- Thanks.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.258
Hey, is everything okay?

09:23.258 --> 09:26.217
Oh.
- We may have a mold problem.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.743
Oh, wow.
Not "may have."

09:29.743 --> 09:31.658
You definitely do.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.050
It's kind of everywhere.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.009
I feel we don't
have money in the budget

09:35.009 --> 09:36.140
for something like this.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.620
You'll figure something out.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.969
You always do.

09:38.969 --> 09:42.494
Yeah, well, anyways,

09:42.494 --> 09:44.888
how's everything
with you and Lois?

09:44.888 --> 09:46.803
Honestly, they've, um,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.588
they've never been better.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.937
Why do you say that?

09:49.937 --> 09:51.025
Um...

09:52.461 --> 09:54.506
Clark Kent...

09:54.506 --> 09:55.943
Wait, no, no, no, no.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.554
Don't worry.
I won't say anything--

09:58.554 --> 09:59.947
when I meet her
for drinks later.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.209
Oh, yeah.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.819
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.397
- What are you doing here?
- Please, Dr. Irons,

10:15.397 --> 10:17.007
it's just a few questions.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.270
I've made it very clear
I didn't want to talk,

10:19.270 --> 10:20.750
but now you come
into my office,

10:20.750 --> 10:22.796
pretending to be
Ginger Metcalf?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.624
I just need to know
if your brother

10:24.624 --> 10:27.714
might've had some connection
to Bruno Mannheim.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.026
John Henry was mixed up
with a lot of bad people.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.593
He was
a decorated army veteran.

10:37.593 --> 10:40.596
Everyone in my family
is military.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.337
My father raised us to serve.

10:42.337 --> 10:45.688
John Henry took that service
and abused it.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.733
How so?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.911
By selling tech and weapons

10:50.911 --> 10:53.696
to the wrong sort of people

10:53.696 --> 10:55.480
like Lex Luthor

10:55.480 --> 10:58.135
and Bruno Mannheim.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.789
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.444
This might help solve
your brother's murder.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.619
Don't you wanna know
who killed him?

11:03.619 --> 11:06.274
I don't even know who he was.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.319
The brother
that I was raised with

11:08.319 --> 11:10.931
never would have
betrayed his country.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.280
Something changed

11:12.280 --> 11:13.673
when he got out of the service,

11:13.673 --> 11:15.762
and whatever that was,

11:15.762 --> 11:17.677
I don't care.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.810
I'm sorry.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.508
I shouldn't have
brought all that up.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.685
I'll go.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.990
Hold on.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.035
You told my nurse
that you've been

11:28.035 --> 11:29.993
experiencing fatigue lately,

11:29.993 --> 11:32.692
along with swollen breasts and
an irregular menstrual cycle.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.215
Yeah, but nothing
out of the ordinary.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.216
Why?
- Well, we need to run

11:35.216 --> 11:37.044
a urine sample, but have you

11:37.044 --> 11:38.262
been sexually active recently?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.832
That's crazy.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.313
Yeah, that crane was,
like, 50 stories high.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.401
- 50?
- Yeah.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.751
Geez, and your dad's cool

11:48.751 --> 11:51.798
with you going, like,
full superhero?

11:51.798 --> 11:53.974
I mean, we're still, like,

11:53.974 --> 11:56.498
feeling out
what I'm allowed to do.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.282
Oh, uh,

11:58.282 --> 11:59.370
I got you something.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.593
It's a Borneo pygmy elephant,

12:04.593 --> 12:07.291
found in Indonesia
and Malaysia--

12:07.291 --> 12:08.771
got it for you
when I was there.

12:08.771 --> 12:09.816
Cool!

12:09.816 --> 12:10.860
Thanks.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.385
What's wrong?

12:15.691 --> 12:18.825
Nothing.
It's just--

12:18.825 --> 12:21.044
uh, I mean,

12:21.044 --> 12:23.786
you're still so nice to me

12:23.786 --> 12:25.745
even after
everything that's happened.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.833
I care about you, Sarah.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.312
I care about you too, Jordan,

12:28.312 --> 12:30.750
but, you know,

12:30.750 --> 12:33.535
as a friend.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.802
Sarah, you're the only one
that knows about my secret.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.935
Exactly.
So you know,

12:41.935 --> 12:44.241
while you're out there
saving people,

12:44.241 --> 12:45.852
you don't have to
risk your identity

12:45.852 --> 12:48.593
to buy a friend a present.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.247
Okay?

12:50.247 --> 12:51.640
Oh, crap!

12:51.640 --> 12:53.381
I'm supposed to go
pick up Soph.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.078
Um,

12:55.078 --> 12:57.298
I'll--I'll see you at your
birthday party tomorrow?

12:57.298 --> 12:58.299
Yeah.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.485
You know,
I still can't believe

13:10.485 --> 13:12.443
they killed Kenny
in the last one.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.836
I was excited
to see how many people

13:13.836 --> 13:15.272
The Carver drops in space.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.796
Yeah, well,
Mr. Carver's pretty handy

13:16.796 --> 13:18.188
at dropping things, right?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.409
Hold on,
have you ever actually seen

13:21.409 --> 13:22.802
a "Slaughter Cabin" movie?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.455
No.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.849
I'm more of a
"Guns of Navarone" guy, myself.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.372
Sorry to disappoint.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.418
No, even better.
It'll be fun to watch

13:30.418 --> 13:31.723
with
a "Slaughter Cabin" virgin.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.421
Ha.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.163
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way,

13:36.163 --> 13:38.905
'cause there's something
I wanted to discuss with you.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.255
Have you ever heard
of the DOD Academy?

13:41.255 --> 13:43.126
Uh, the one in Metropolis?

13:43.126 --> 13:48.044
See, I think you could really
benefit from a place like that.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.524
I'm already in school.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.917
A genius like you
has no business

13:50.917 --> 13:52.527
being in Smallville High.

13:52.527 --> 13:53.876
You need to be challenged,

13:53.876 --> 13:55.182
tackling the kind of projects

13:55.182 --> 13:57.227
that bring about
real world change.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.623
So you invited me out here
to recruit me?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.843
The sooner I get you there,
I'm telling you,

14:03.843 --> 14:04.887
sky's the limit.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.023
Two tickets for the
space-murder movie, please.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.903
Okay, so I went to stop
a crane from collapsing

14:20.903 --> 14:22.165
in Kuala Lumpur,

14:22.165 --> 14:23.514
and guess
who was already there.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.125
I'll tell you who--Jordan.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.430
He went there alone?

14:26.430 --> 14:27.823
Yeah,
and when I asked him about it,

14:27.823 --> 14:29.781
he said he
"had it under control,"

14:29.781 --> 14:31.174
like it was completely fine

14:31.174 --> 14:32.654
for him to be
in another country.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.612
All right, we'll talk
to him later tonight.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.918
You know, it is truly amazing

14:35.918 --> 14:37.224
how much
they don't listen to us.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.965
I just keep telling myself

14:38.965 --> 14:40.227
it's gonna be so much easier

14:40.227 --> 14:42.490
when they're
out of high school.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.491
Uh-huh.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.887
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.152
I don't know.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.288
I might be pregnant.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
- Pregnant?
- There's still some bloodwork

15:09.734 --> 15:12.302
she has to do, but
there's a pretty good chance.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.958
I--I mean, how?

15:15.958 --> 15:18.613
- Clark.
- No--you know what I mean.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.180
Did you think
that this would happen?

15:20.180 --> 15:22.312
I mean, I didn't even think it
was possible.

15:22.312 --> 15:25.185
Me neither, but here we are.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.013
Right.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.492
How are you feeling?

15:28.492 --> 15:31.713
Surprised, mainly.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.846
This would be
a really big change for us.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.588
Are we ready
for something like this?

15:37.588 --> 15:39.503
I don't know.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.548
Me neither.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.421
But, hey--hey,
whatever happens,

15:44.421 --> 15:48.295
we'll--we'll figure it out,
you know?

15:48.295 --> 15:51.037
There's nothing the two of us
can't do together.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.081
Mm.

15:53.430 --> 15:57.304
Probably means no more
day trips to Tal's villa.

15:57.304 --> 16:00.350
I'm pretty sure that's how
we got into this situation.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.136
Yeah...

16:04.964 --> 16:06.835
<i>It appears,
due to shipping delays,</i>

16:06.835 --> 16:08.445
<i>neither of the birthday gifts</i>

16:08.445 --> 16:11.535
<i>you purchased
will arrive in time.</i>

16:11.535 --> 16:13.059
Cancel the order.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.104
I'll pick them up myself.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.540
Hey.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.977
How was it?
- It sucked.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.285
- What'd Sam do?
- He didn't invite me out

16:22.285 --> 16:23.678
to get to know me better.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.114
He just wanted me
to go to a stupid school

16:25.114 --> 16:27.247
and work at the DOD someday.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.770
- He said that?
- You know, I don't know why

16:28.770 --> 16:30.511
I thought he'd be like Grandpa!

16:30.511 --> 16:31.947
He's nowhere near the same guy.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.218
Where you been?

16:42.218 --> 16:44.960
You know, just flying around.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.267
Sarah's being Sarah,
and Dad's all mad at me, so...

16:47.267 --> 16:50.705
Yeah, he's had that weird
look on his face all afternoon.

16:50.705 --> 16:53.925
What'd you do?

16:53.925 --> 16:55.362
Tried to stop
a construction crane

16:55.362 --> 16:58.278
from falling off
a high-rise in Kuala Lumpur.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.583
Right.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.890
Yeah, Dad said
I made it worse.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.544
Did you?

17:03.544 --> 17:05.372
I don't know, man.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.026
I was just trying to help.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.114
I get it.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.289
I do.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.030
But you know, if you can't yet,

17:11.030 --> 17:14.642
maybe just leave that stuff
to him until you can.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.339
I mean,

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
he's been Superman
a long time.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.869
Why you still studying?

17:24.869 --> 17:26.480
Gotta pass this test, man.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.873
I mean, I know
you returned your truck

17:28.873 --> 17:32.399
and that driving means
nothing to you anymore,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.966
but...

17:34.966 --> 17:36.055
this is my freedom.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.971
You nervous?

17:39.971 --> 17:43.279
You know, I wasn't, until
I practiced with Mom today.

17:43.279 --> 17:47.457
She nitpicks everything, so...

17:47.457 --> 17:49.894
Yeah.
Yeah, it's annoying.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.767
But I mean, is she right?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.856
- Dude.
- I mean, if driving

17:54.856 --> 17:57.380
really does mean
everything you say it does,

17:57.380 --> 17:58.990
maybe you should listen to her?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.254
She has been driving a long...

18:01.254 --> 18:02.429
Time.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.127
All right, man, look.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.651
I'm no Mom, but if you wanna
practice some of the things

18:07.651 --> 18:09.436
she thinks you need to work on,

18:09.436 --> 18:10.480
I'm game.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.180
- Let's go.
- Hey.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
All right,
I can't promise you

18:15.616 --> 18:16.747
you're not gonna die though, so...

18:22.405 --> 18:24.538
This is all you have?

18:24.538 --> 18:25.582
More in the back.

18:38.987 --> 18:43.296
Oh, wow. Oh, uh...

18:43.296 --> 18:45.298
how is Lois?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.996
Uh, still processing.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.998
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, uh--

18:49.998 --> 18:51.130
And--and you?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.741
I mean,

18:53.741 --> 18:55.656
starting over,

18:55.656 --> 18:58.267
two teenagers in the house...

19:00.530 --> 19:02.228
Um, look, Clark,

19:02.228 --> 19:04.578
I don't mean to overstep,

19:04.578 --> 19:06.884
but if there's any hesitation

19:06.884 --> 19:07.972
on your part...

19:10.105 --> 19:11.150
You need to tell Lois.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.894
This is a nightmare, Lois.

19:16.894 --> 19:20.159
Right, and Dean's books
make no sense.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.509
So now I have to figure out

19:22.509 --> 19:24.511
which pot to borrow money from

19:24.511 --> 19:26.208
for all the mitigation work
at the school.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.775
You got this.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.211
You were a loan manager
for years.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.256
You could do this
in your sleep.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.996
Another old-fashioned?

19:31.996 --> 19:33.520
- Perfect.
- Good with water still?

19:33.520 --> 19:34.738
Yeah, thanks.

19:34.738 --> 19:35.826
I'm like, "Water?"

19:35.826 --> 19:37.480
Lois.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.138
No...

19:43.138 --> 19:45.314
Lana.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.098
Oh, my God, wait.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.057
Clark told me
things were really great

19:49.057 --> 19:50.363
between the two of you.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.886
He was right.
- He said that?

19:51.886 --> 19:54.105
Yeah, it was written
all over his face

19:54.105 --> 19:57.413
the same way it's written
all over your face right now.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.067
Oh, my God.
How far along?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.286
I don't know--
I don't even know

20:00.286 --> 20:01.678
if this is a thing.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.637
But also we have
two almost-16-year-olds.

20:03.637 --> 20:04.681
What are we even thinking?

20:06.422 --> 20:08.816
You're thinking
how perfect it is

20:08.816 --> 20:12.167
when a baby's asleep
in your arms,

20:12.167 --> 20:15.214
and now you wanna just
nibble on those little toes.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.566
And the first time
you hear them giggle

20:19.566 --> 20:21.481
when they say your name.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.831
I mean, all the things
we're too tired to appreciate

20:23.831 --> 20:26.268
the first time around.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.096
So you would
want another one?

20:28.096 --> 20:30.141
Yeah.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.230
For sure.

20:33.449 --> 20:34.450
You?

20:37.192 --> 20:38.889
I don't know.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.373
I think so, yeah.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.507
Then that's your answer.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.778
And remember,
for the three-point turn,

20:57.778 --> 20:58.779
first, you steer left.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.346
I got this, Mom.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.477
Don't worry, honey.
Nothing is gonna come up

21:01.477 --> 21:02.522
that we haven't practiced for.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.222
Coach Gaines?

21:07.222 --> 21:08.702
You work at the DMV?

21:08.702 --> 21:10.573
Imagine that.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.488
Now, why would
I need another job?

21:22.498 --> 21:23.499
Should I just start driving?

21:23.499 --> 21:24.674
You gonna crash this car

21:24.674 --> 21:25.762
like you did
my football program?

21:25.762 --> 21:26.894
Uh, no, sir.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.505
"No, sir."

21:43.389 --> 21:45.304
- So?
- Coach Gaines deducted points

21:45.304 --> 21:47.262
right off the bat for attitude.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.655
Attitude?

21:48.655 --> 21:50.483
Being a detriment
to public safety.

21:50.483 --> 21:51.788
Oh.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.616
I'm sorry, bud.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.488
Well, maybe next time.
- But I still passed.

21:55.488 --> 21:56.793
What?
You passed?

21:56.793 --> 21:57.794
Ah!

21:57.794 --> 21:59.318
That's amazing!

21:59.318 --> 22:00.797
All right.
All right, I'm gonna go ask

22:00.797 --> 22:02.146
Jordan if he wants a ride
up to Vicky May's.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.626
Okay, all right.
Oh, hey,

22:03.626 --> 22:04.845
we still
need to sit down and talk--

22:04.845 --> 22:06.020
Yeah, yeah, maybe later!

22:07.282 --> 22:08.762
We have another driver.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.679
It was incredible, Clark.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.724
He was so happy.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.858
He hasn't hugged me
like that in years.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.687
I feel like
I got my little boy back.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.906
I'm glad
you were there for that.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.431
I think I want more.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.475
Driver's test?

22:27.737 --> 22:29.260
Kids.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.699
Today just reminded me
of how truly magical it is

22:32.699 --> 22:34.048
to be a mom.
Even when it's hard,

22:34.048 --> 22:35.223
it's the best thing
in the world.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.790
Mm-hmm.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.487
I know it'll be different,
but it's also a chance

22:38.487 --> 22:41.621
to start over
and do it even better.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.492
Yeah.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.972
Yeah, no, you're right--

22:44.972 --> 22:46.234
totally.

22:48.279 --> 22:49.716
Cake's here.
We'll talk

22:49.716 --> 22:50.847
more about it later, kay?
- Yeah.

22:50.847 --> 22:51.892
- Okay.
- Yeah.

23:08.952 --> 23:09.997
Oh, look, Sarah's here.

23:12.695 --> 23:13.696
Hey, John--

23:19.223 --> 23:21.095
Mm, I had a nice time
with your daughter--

23:21.095 --> 23:22.966
You had no business
talking to her about schools.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.012
Whoa, hand to heart,

23:25.012 --> 23:26.448
I was gonna run it by you.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.928
I just wanted
to gauge her interest--

23:27.928 --> 23:30.017
Nat's interest was you.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.368
She was excited
to spend time together.

23:33.368 --> 23:36.458
- Same here.
- Then what were you doing?

23:36.458 --> 23:40.375
She's a 15-year-old-girl
whose world was destroyed.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.639
She needs friends and family,

23:43.639 --> 23:46.860
not a recruitment officer
looking for his big prize.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.690
Damn it.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.431
You're right.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.258
I was--I was out of line.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.565
I know
you're not her granddad.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.220
You don't have to be.
But don't get her hopes up

23:59.220 --> 24:01.396
that you want to be
part of her life.

24:01.396 --> 24:03.442
She's lost enough
people already.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.361
Dude, dude,
I get to the DMV,

24:10.361 --> 24:13.234
guess who ends up
taking my test.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.583
Coach Gaines.

24:14.583 --> 24:15.802
all: No.

24:15.802 --> 24:16.846
Not kidding.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.544
You invited teachers?

24:18.544 --> 24:20.676
- Hey, guys!
- She works with my mom.

24:20.676 --> 24:21.764
Hey, Ms. Beppo.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.157
Hey, I got you something.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.419
Oh, God, no, please.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.595
It's just Chrissy.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.292
Here, um, I got you something

24:28.292 --> 24:30.469
for your big one-six.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.253
It's an alarm clock.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.168
You know, for, like,
waking up in the morning

24:34.168 --> 24:36.170
for, like, school and--
you know, alarm clock,

24:36.170 --> 24:38.520
and it makes--yeah.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.913
You know
what an alarm clock is!

24:39.913 --> 24:41.262
Okay.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.090
That's cool.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.440
Thanks.
- Well, I'm gonna go party

24:45.440 --> 24:47.268
like it's 1999.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.752
Cool.
We should go inside, guys.

24:52.752 --> 24:53.970
- Yeah.
- Yep.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.279
So what do you think?

25:01.064 --> 25:02.588
Even put any rub
on the skin?

25:02.588 --> 25:04.677
Uh,
was it not enough?

25:04.677 --> 25:06.156
Well, see, now, the fact
that you're even asking

25:06.156 --> 25:07.636
that question right there

25:07.636 --> 25:08.768
tells you the answer.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.509
Number one rule in barbecue--

25:10.509 --> 25:11.640
you can't fear the flame.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.076
Um, okay.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.208
Any ideas on how to fix it?

25:14.208 --> 25:15.470
Uh, maybe, like, uh,

25:15.470 --> 25:17.124
garlic pepper?

25:17.124 --> 25:20.649
Uh, let me, let me,
uh, go raid your pantry

25:20.649 --> 25:22.956
and see if I can't
come up with something.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.044
Kay.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.527
Smells good to me.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.054
Hey there, Beppo.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.665
What, are you, uh, hiding out
in here or something?

25:38.841 --> 25:40.887
Biggest event
on my social calendar

25:40.887 --> 25:43.411
is a party for teenage boys.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.413
This is what rock bottom
looks like.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.936
I'll see your rock bottom

25:46.936 --> 25:50.157
and raise you
my daughter's quinceañera.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.986
Sorry, that was pretty tragic.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.683
Yeah.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.859
Well, tragic is
kind of how I roll these days.

25:56.859 --> 25:59.427
You're certainly
not alone in that.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.214
I appreciate the company.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.808
Thank you, everyone
for coming out.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.593
It means so much to us,

26:34.593 --> 26:38.727
and because we do love
to embarrass our 16-year-olds,

26:38.727 --> 26:40.250
let's take a look back

26:40.250 --> 26:42.775
at what feels like
it was just yesterday.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.910
<i>[Bright Eyes'

Henry Miller?

28:35.496 --> 28:36.497
You're supposed to be in jail.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.811
You have powers?

28:45.811 --> 28:47.987
Just like you.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.357
I could do this all day.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.884
Not around them.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.595
Henry, who did this to you?

30:14.595 --> 30:17.032
Who gave you powers?

30:17.032 --> 30:18.512
They're coming for me.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.036
Who?

30:21.036 --> 30:22.429
I can't let them stop me.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.605
I have to finish this first.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.525
Happy birthday.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.614
Oh, uh,

30:33.614 --> 30:35.442
hi, Sarah.

30:35.442 --> 30:36.573
You ignoring me?

30:36.573 --> 30:38.184
No, I, um--

30:38.184 --> 30:39.881
Kinda feels like
you're ignoring me.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.277
Yeah.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.148
I didn't know what to say.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.281
How about,
"What's up, Sarah?

30:48.281 --> 30:51.153
How's your day going?"

30:51.153 --> 30:53.634
I just--I don't want
this to be awkward.

30:53.634 --> 30:54.722
I mean--

30:54.722 --> 30:56.506
it is awkward.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.291
I wanna be with you,
but you don't wanna be with me.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.988
That's super-awkward.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.689
Jordan, the last thing
I wanna do is hurt you,

31:05.689 --> 31:09.780
because I do still
really care about you.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.740
I just need
some time for myself,

31:12.740 --> 31:14.394
and all that I'm asking is that

31:14.394 --> 31:16.700
you respect that.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.006
Please?

31:20.182 --> 31:21.444
Okay.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.238
What'cha doing?

31:32.238 --> 31:34.893
Oh, can you, like,
hear something?

31:36.155 --> 31:37.156
Yeah.

31:38.853 --> 31:39.898
Is it bad?

31:42.335 --> 31:43.379
Yeah.

31:44.511 --> 31:46.905
Are you gonna, like, fly off?

31:50.038 --> 31:50.996
No.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.958
Happy birthday.

31:58.829 --> 31:59.874
Thanks.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.842
Henry,
just tell me who did this

32:11.842 --> 32:13.801
to you.
I can help you.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.194
No one can help me.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.733
There aren't any bullets.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.674
What's Mayor Dean doing here?

33:44.674 --> 33:46.415
Lana.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.461
You need to put those funds
back where you found 'em.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.202
George?

33:50.202 --> 33:52.291
You may think moving that
money around is a good idea,

33:52.291 --> 33:54.423
but I had it earmarked
for a reason.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.946
Then you'll have
to convince me

33:55.946 --> 33:58.253
it's better
than fixing our school,

33:58.253 --> 34:00.255
the same school
your son goes to.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.431
The kids there got
healthy enough lungs.

34:02.431 --> 34:04.477
A little fungus isn't
gonna do any harm.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.348
Okay. We're done here.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.829
This is serious.
You can't be messing around

34:08.829 --> 34:10.265
in things you don't understand.

34:10.265 --> 34:14.052
That is so unbelievably patronizing.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.402
I am the mayor, George, not you.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.622
You are in way
over your head.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.624
I think it's time
for you to go.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.542
This isn't finished, Lana.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.419
Let's have some cake,
shall we?

34:41.427 --> 34:42.689
Ah...

34:44.517 --> 34:47.085
I want to apologize
for last night.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.390
Don't.

34:48.390 --> 34:49.739
You're not my granddad.

34:49.739 --> 34:52.742
- - You're right.
- I'm not.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.831
But that doesn't mean I don't
want to get to know you.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.572
And not because of some school,

34:56.572 --> 35:00.837
which was a really stupid,
asinine thing to bring up.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.145
Look,

35:04.145 --> 35:06.887
what you need to know about me,
the me of this Earth,

35:06.887 --> 35:08.758
is I'm terrible with people.

35:08.758 --> 35:12.632
I-I always say the wrong thing
at the wrong time.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.416
I'm basically a failed nation

35:14.416 --> 35:18.507
when it comes to any sort
of personal relationships.

35:18.507 --> 35:23.599
But I did genuinely want
to spend time with you.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.253
And if--if--

35:25.253 --> 35:27.995
if you could forgive me...

35:29.431 --> 35:31.041
I'd really like another chance

35:31.041 --> 35:33.566
for us to get
to know each other.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.005
Okay.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.093
Yeah?

35:39.093 --> 35:40.660
Yeah.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.357
Okay. Here.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.750
- Thanks.
- No, I-I--

35:43.750 --> 35:45.534
I got it for you, so.

35:48.755 --> 35:52.715
Uh, seriously?

35:52.715 --> 35:54.413
Just wear them once
for your granddad,

35:54.413 --> 35:56.589
and then you can take 'em back.
- Great.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.112
So did you guys have
a good birthday?

35:58.112 --> 36:00.419
- Pretty much.
- Yeah, it was cool.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.160
- Oh, pretty much.
- Uh, it was cool.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.596
- The party was great.
- Thank you very much

36:03.596 --> 36:04.597
for the birthday.
- You guys are the best.

36:04.597 --> 36:05.641
It was a lot of fun.

36:05.641 --> 36:06.903
You know, I remember it was

36:06.903 --> 36:08.427
right around this time
16 years ago--

36:08.427 --> 36:09.776
Okay, she's starting
the play-by-play.

36:09.776 --> 36:11.517
She's starting it.
- Oh, come on.

36:11.517 --> 36:12.822
You guys don't want to hear
about when you were born?

36:12.822 --> 36:14.172
You know,
not for the hundredth time.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.477
- No, thank you.
- It was very painful,

36:15.477 --> 36:16.696
don't you ever forget that.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.006
What?

36:24.443 --> 36:26.706
I think I want
another one too.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.839
Right after I'm screeching
about how painful it was?

36:29.839 --> 36:31.972
Yeah, that was pretty much,
like, the final push.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.061
No pun intended.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.456
No, it's just--I don't know.

36:37.456 --> 36:40.023
Watching that video today
and seeing

36:40.023 --> 36:42.374
how much the boys have
grown up, it just--

36:42.374 --> 36:44.811
it made me miss having
little ones in the house,

36:44.811 --> 36:46.465
especially ones we made.

36:46.465 --> 36:47.988
We do make pretty good kids.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.990
Yeah.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.688
You know,
the boys are upstairs.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.734
And nobody's
at Tal's ski chalet.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.301
No.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.197
Morning.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.068
Yeah. Hey.

37:25.068 --> 37:27.375
How's it goin'?

37:27.375 --> 37:30.422
Um, so last night--

37:31.684 --> 37:33.381
That was--that was fun.

37:33.381 --> 37:36.906
I mean, you're so great--

37:36.906 --> 37:41.433
great as a person,
not at, you know--

37:41.433 --> 37:44.044
though yeah, very enjoyable.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.611
Uh, appreciate that.

37:45.611 --> 37:49.615
Um, but we--we can't
ever do that again.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.530
Right?
Because, like,

37:51.530 --> 37:53.140
super messy.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.578
But again, you are so great,

37:56.578 --> 38:00.016
just wonderful,
right, wonderful man.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.717
But this, you know,
it's--it's--

38:04.717 --> 38:07.502
it's gonna have to be
a one and done.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.374
Yeah, pretty much figured
that was the case.

38:09.374 --> 38:13.726
Okay, so this never
happened, right?

38:13.726 --> 38:15.467
That's right.

38:21.951 --> 38:24.737
Hey.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.739
I didn't see you
at the party.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.132
Uh, no, I-I just--

38:29.132 --> 38:30.699
I just left early.

38:30.699 --> 38:33.311
Um, wh-what--what's up?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.269
What--what can I do for you?

38:40.405 --> 38:42.407
I signed the divorce papers.

38:44.322 --> 38:48.717
I-I didn't want your lawyer
to bother you anymore.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.468
Um...

39:07.954 --> 39:10.913
I'll talk to you later.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.046
Yeah.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.937
You're not gonna
believe this.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.461
What?

39:38.071 --> 39:40.682
Henry Miller had
a brain tumor.

39:40.682 --> 39:42.205
That's why he was
out of prison.

39:42.205 --> 39:43.816
They granted him
a compassionate release

39:43.816 --> 39:45.470
'cause he only had
a few weeks left to live.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.733
- When did he get out?
- Three months ago.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.169
Well, what's he been doing
this whole time?

39:56.698 --> 39:58.134
Is everything okay?

39:58.134 --> 39:59.527
Y-yeah, of course
everything's okay.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.311
Why wouldn't it be?

40:01.311 --> 40:03.096
Please tell me

40:03.096 --> 40:04.358
that you have
the mold story ready.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.708
Uh, just under
a thousand words.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.105
This is Lois.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.802
<i>Hello, Ms. Lane.</i>

40:13.802 --> 40:16.065
<i>This is Dr. Irons.</i>
- Hey, Dr. Irons.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.719
<i>So I just got
your results back,</i>

40:17.719 --> 40:20.983
<i>and it seems we can
rule out pregnancy.</i>

40:20.983 --> 40:22.115
Are you sure?

40:22.115 --> 40:23.116
<i>Yes.</i>

40:26.772 --> 40:28.295
<i>And I'm still
concerned about some</i>

40:28.295 --> 40:29.775
<i>of these symptoms
you're having.</i>

40:29.775 --> 40:31.341
Needs a better closer.

40:31.341 --> 40:32.821
<i>Let's schedule you
an appointment</i>

40:32.821 --> 40:34.910
<i>with our lab
here in Metropolis.</i>

40:34.910 --> 40:36.695
<i>I'd like to run
some more tests</i>

40:36.695 --> 40:40.133
<i>and figure out
what's causing all this.</i>

40:53.929 --> 40:56.323
Try again.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.847
It's been too long.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.980
Then increase the dosage.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.765
He's dead, so
if we increase the dosage--

41:08.727 --> 41:10.468
Yes, Mr. Mannheim. Right away.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.040
Don't look at me like that.

41:37.407 --> 41:39.627
It appears to be working.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.373
Just like I told you.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.769
We're getting closer.

42:16.838 --> 42:19.014
Greg, move your head.
