watch a movie?

35:20.540 --> 35:22.950
Oh, you had me at cozy!

35:23.150 --> 35:27.120
But there is one thing
I still need to do first.

35:34.130 --> 35:35.790
- Iris, that's--
- Yeah, I know.

35:35.990 --> 35:38.650
I've been struggling over
whether or not to publish it.

35:40.260 --> 35:43.100
- You don't have to do this.
We already decided

35:43.300 --> 35:44.540
to let the rest of our future
be unwritten.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.060
Yeah, I know.

35:47.260 --> 35:49.280
And we will.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.720
It's just that
being a journalist,

35:52.920 --> 35:55.290
my future isn't unwritten.

35:55.490 --> 35:57.940
And that has nothing to do
with the Mapbook

35:58.140 --> 36:03.430
or anything that Deon
or Bart or Nora has said.

36:03.630 --> 36:06.160
It's because
I've been writing it all along.

36:22.830 --> 36:25.230
- Cecile, this food
looks incredible.

36:25.430 --> 36:26.620
- Yeah, no, seriously.
You could feed

36:26.820 --> 36:28.280
half of Central City
with this spread.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.280
- Well, no one,
and I mean no one,

36:31.480 --> 36:33.240
goes hungry in our house.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.850
Oh, my God, I'm turning
into my grandmother.

36:35.050 --> 36:38.030
Okay, this cheesy
sausage and egg casserole

36:38.230 --> 36:39.590
is her recipe.
Enjoy.

36:39.790 --> 36:41.200
- Who needs cheesy fries
when you have that?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.860
- Ditto that.
I'm gonna need that recipe.

36:43.060 --> 36:44.210
Is it like a family secret?

36:44.410 --> 36:46.250
- I know people.
I'll get it for you.

36:46.450 --> 36:47.510
Can we do this every week?

36:47.710 --> 36:49.210
And I don't just mean the food.

36:49.410 --> 36:51.000
This just is so wonderful.

36:51.190 --> 36:52.870
Thank you all
for making me feel at home.

36:53.070 --> 36:55.340
- Of course. You're part
of this family now too.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.830
[knocking on door]

36:58.030 --> 36:59.350
- Are we expecting
someone else?

36:59.550 --> 37:01.210
- Mm-mm.
- I am.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.480
Hey.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.800
Hi.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.460
- all: Hey.
- Hey, man.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.630
- Don't worry.
Since I'm guessing

37:19.830 --> 37:21.810
Khione already told you
what happened,

37:22.010 --> 37:23.370
I won't come in.

37:28.630 --> 37:30.030
I'll be right back.

37:37.210 --> 37:39.080
- Thanks
for letting me drop by.

37:42.780 --> 37:45.480
Look, I know
what I did to you was wrong

37:45.680 --> 37:47.740
and seriously screwed up.

37:48.780 --> 37:50.190
For whatever it's worth,

37:50.380 --> 37:51.970
Frost was supposed
to be my ride or die,

37:52.170 --> 37:56.450
you know,
my destiny.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.890
Ever since she's been gone,
it's like I'm stuck

37:59.090 --> 38:01.370
in some bad dream.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.670
And I can't wake up.

38:12.630 --> 38:15.300
But the truth is, there
is no waking up from this.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.600
And now it's got me
hurting everyone around me,

38:17.800 --> 38:19.510
just like I hurt you.

38:23.300 --> 38:30.140
So I just wanted
to come by to say that...

38:30.340 --> 38:32.660
I'm really sorry, Khione.

38:32.860 --> 38:34.360
I wasn't thinking right.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.140
And I totally understand
if you never want to see me.

38:36.340 --> 38:38.530
Mark, I forgive you.

38:42.710 --> 38:46.020
- You--really?

38:46.220 --> 38:47.550
Yes.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.410
That's what friends do.

38:56.810 --> 38:59.430
I'm really gonna miss you.

38:59.630 --> 39:02.560
Where are you going?

39:02.760 --> 39:04.960
Away.

39:05.150 --> 39:07.960
You taught me
one other important thing:

39:08.160 --> 39:13.350
no one can take away this pain,
not even you.

39:15.170 --> 39:17.840
So in order to get over it

39:18.040 --> 39:19.670
and learn to live
with whatever it is,

39:19.870 --> 39:23.580
I need to go through it,

39:23.780 --> 39:26.500
all of it.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.930
Alone.

39:31.760 --> 39:37.940
Hey, promise me you'll
keep exploring your powers.

39:38.140 --> 39:41.210
Khione, there has got to be

39:41.410 --> 39:43.510
something amazing
inside of you.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.640
I promise.

39:54.650 --> 39:55.870
Okay.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.580
