12:47.119 --> 12:49.974
Ordinary tools are no
good on enchanted wood.

12:50.009 --> 12:51.976
But this one...

12:52.011 --> 12:54.255
this one was special to my father.

12:55.396 --> 12:57.948
I just hope I can live up to him.

13:02.946 --> 13:07.458
He said a true woodcarver
must always be in conversation

13:07.493 --> 13:10.329
with his tool and his materials.

13:13.064 --> 13:14.697
A sword, Princess?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.367
The Emma I knew was far more interested

13:18.403 --> 13:20.803
in fancy dresses and high tea.

13:20.838 --> 13:22.638
Where I come from, I'm not a princess.

13:22.673 --> 13:25.494
I'm... a Savior.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.300
Interesting jobs in your world.

13:27.678 --> 13:28.711
[Chuckling] Yeah.

13:28.746 --> 13:30.878
I spend a lot more time
around swords than dresses.

13:30.914 --> 13:32.981
What exactly does a Savior do?

13:33.920 --> 13:35.183
A lot of things.

13:35.219 --> 13:38.587
I... protect people.

13:38.851 --> 13:42.357
That's... the gist of it, I guess.

13:42.392 --> 13:45.093
So why so glum? Seems like a good thing.

13:45.129 --> 13:47.060
Because the job comes with a destiny.

13:47.429 --> 13:49.830
I'm supposed to protect my
family, but I die doing it.

13:49.836 --> 13:51.235
It's my fate.

13:51.958 --> 13:56.036
And this sword... this
is what will finish me.

13:57.106 --> 13:59.109
Stop talking.

14:00.943 --> 14:03.110
Back away from the princess.

14:06.248 --> 14:08.047
Killian?

14:08.082 --> 14:11.851
Don't worry, Princess.
I'm here to rescue you.

14:11.886 --> 14:15.054
After I kill whoever the blazes this is.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.671
Gold: Lonely here, isn't it?

14:27.568 --> 14:30.807
If you're here to talk
me off my path, you can't.

14:30.842 --> 14:33.643
This is my fate.

14:33.679 --> 14:36.412
Well, fate's a tricky business.

14:36.448 --> 14:38.848
It still requires work.

14:38.884 --> 14:41.017
And planning.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.558
I see what this is.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.252
You don't think I'm strong enough.

14:50.288 --> 14:53.656
Don't walk away from your father.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.057
You've been alive 28 years.

14:55.093 --> 14:56.726
I've been alive hundreds.

14:56.761 --> 14:59.629
There are things a man learns.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.766
Take your hand off me.

15:06.837 --> 15:09.805
You know, I waited years
for a moment like this...

15:09.840 --> 15:11.807
when I could finally tell
my own father that I was

15:11.842 --> 15:13.809
better than him and stronger
than him, so you go ahead.

15:13.844 --> 15:15.811
You show me.

15:16.599 --> 15:19.414
You think you know all about me.

15:19.449 --> 15:20.581
You have no idea.

15:20.617 --> 15:23.751
I know your childhood is
full of pain, just like mine.

15:24.338 --> 15:26.153
You want someone to pay for that?

15:26.188 --> 15:27.588
Make me pay.

15:29.358 --> 15:31.526
It is my fault, after all, is it not?

15:31.561 --> 15:33.127
I let the Black Fairy take you.

15:33.162 --> 15:36.330
I couldn't protect you. So you go ahead.

15:36.365 --> 15:37.797
Do it. Hit me.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.304
Hit me.

15:43.805 --> 15:45.304
Hit me!

15:46.575 --> 15:50.343
If you can't hit me, how do
you expect to kill the Savior?

15:54.314 --> 15:56.314
I can help you, son.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.954
I don't need your help.

16:07.118 --> 16:09.194
Uh, okay, uh...

16:09.229 --> 16:10.828
How many times do I need to ask?

16:10.864 --> 16:12.564
Please, let him go.

16:12.599 --> 16:14.032
Princess Enya, please.

16:15.787 --> 16:17.898
Leave the daring rescue
to the professionals.

16:17.904 --> 16:18.937
It's Emma.

16:20.774 --> 16:21.706
Who is?

16:21.741 --> 16:23.541
My... Me. My name is Emma.

16:23.577 --> 16:25.309
I don't need to be rescued.

16:25.344 --> 16:29.582
Well, not anymore, thanks to
Captain Hook, at your service.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.682
Hey, now! [Groans]

16:31.717 --> 16:33.550
That is not very sporting, mate!

16:33.586 --> 16:36.553
Like the lady said, she
doesn't need any rescuing.

16:36.589 --> 16:38.922
The royal family does not agree.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.224
There's a handsome
reward out for her return.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.394
Sword, please.

16:44.429 --> 16:48.931
Oh! Hook, please! We really
don't want to hurt you!

16:48.967 --> 16:51.266
I'm sorry, do you... you know him?

16:51.302 --> 16:53.869
A version of him in the other world.

16:53.905 --> 16:56.005
We sort of live together.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.710
[Both grunting]

17:03.136 --> 17:04.512
Now...

17:04.547 --> 17:08.016
You might have my sword, but
I've got your... this thing.

17:08.050 --> 17:09.617
Chisel.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.952
Now we duel.

17:14.175 --> 17:15.413
Hook, stop!

17:18.304 --> 17:19.526
Wow.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.929
I really need to get home
and get someone off the rum.

17:23.679 --> 17:25.265
And the dessert.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.366
Sorry, Hook.

17:26.401 --> 17:28.769
I think it's time to go back
to the <i> Jolly Roger.</i>

17:32.942 --> 17:33.907
Oh, no.

17:40.348 --> 17:41.653
Oh, no.

17:42.984 --> 17:43.916
[Sighs]

17:43.952 --> 17:45.952
Can you fix it?

17:45.987 --> 17:48.955
No. I cannot.

17:51.126 --> 17:52.424
Well, you have a whole
other chest of tools.

17:52.460 --> 17:53.358
Maybe there's something else.

17:53.393 --> 17:56.928
No, I need <i> magic</i>
to carve the tree!

17:57.648 --> 17:58.730
I'm not my father.

17:58.766 --> 18:02.067
I'm not... good enough.

18:08.608 --> 18:11.942
I'm sorry you put
your faith in me, Emma.

18:11.978 --> 18:14.945
I hope you never make
that mistake again.

18:20.420 --> 18:21.785
You two!

18:22.328 --> 18:24.281
Keep an eye on them until I return.

18:25.624 --> 18:28.958
I am so sorry about all this.

18:28.994 --> 18:31.961
I never meant for you to get hurt.

18:31.997 --> 18:35.165
Yes, well, then you
failed with flying colors.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.766
Now I'm going to die for nothing,

18:36.802 --> 18:38.501
having accomplished nothing.

18:38.536 --> 18:42.105
Not true. You're Robin Hood.

18:43.722 --> 18:45.841
Think of all the people you've helped.

18:45.876 --> 18:46.842
Robin Hood?

18:46.877 --> 18:49.424
No, I am Robin of
Locksley, and I'm a thief.

18:49.430 --> 18:52.547
A thief who steals from the
rich and gives to the poor.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.548
Gives to the poor?

18:53.584 --> 18:55.684
Why the hell would I do that?

18:56.871 --> 18:58.037
Wait.

18:58.043 --> 19:02.093
So you're telling me
you're just a common thief?

19:02.099 --> 19:04.320
I am not a "common" anything.

19:04.607 --> 19:06.940
I steal from the rich
to make myself rich.

19:08.609 --> 19:10.832
And that makes you happy?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.096
No, I don't believe it.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.682
It must be Marian.

19:20.657 --> 19:22.209
What do you know of Marian?

19:23.634 --> 19:25.278
Your wife.

19:25.313 --> 19:28.360
No. She was never my wife. She...

19:29.993 --> 19:32.719
she died before we could marry.

19:33.526 --> 19:35.205
I'm so sorry.

19:36.557 --> 19:38.624
So, there's no one?

19:38.659 --> 19:43.062
No. Never.

19:43.638 --> 19:47.699
And even so, your... life...

19:47.735 --> 19:49.401
it makes you happy?

19:52.839 --> 19:55.039
That's not exactly what I said.

19:55.075 --> 19:56.420
That's what <i> you</i> said.

19:58.245 --> 20:02.213
If you want the truth, Your Majesty,

20:02.249 --> 20:04.682
I haven't been happy
for a very long time.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.052
You never had love.

20:09.088 --> 20:10.720
[Shouting in the distance]

20:11.244 --> 20:12.222
What was that?

20:12.258 --> 20:13.590
[Horse neighs]

20:19.298 --> 20:20.430
[Clang]

20:20.465 --> 20:22.065
Please! Help me!

20:22.101 --> 20:23.633
[Screams]

20:25.004 --> 20:27.170
Oh, don't worry. I know who did that.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.238
He's on our side.

20:29.274 --> 20:31.674
After all those years locked
up, it's certainly nice

20:31.709 --> 20:33.342
to stretch one's legs again.

20:33.377 --> 20:34.643
[Sighs]

20:34.679 --> 20:35.912
[Giggles]

20:35.947 --> 20:37.079
[Gate creaks]

20:37.115 --> 20:39.115
[Laughs]

20:39.150 --> 20:42.351
Impeccable timing, as always.

20:42.386 --> 20:45.153
Now, will you please take this cuff off?

20:45.189 --> 20:47.022
Well, that's the
question, isn't it, dearie?

20:47.057 --> 20:48.790
Will I or won't I?

20:48.826 --> 20:52.160
Now, on the one hand, you did
help me escape from my prison.

20:52.196 --> 20:55.363
On the other, you
kidnapped the woman I loved

20:55.398 --> 20:57.799
and starved her to death in a tower.

20:57.835 --> 21:00.634
I went looking for Belle
and this is what I found.

21:05.796 --> 21:07.141
That wasn't me.

21:07.654 --> 21:09.343
Not really. I...

21:09.835 --> 21:10.934
I'm not even from this world.

21:10.940 --> 21:13.113
Oh, I know that, dearie,
but I have to hurt someone,

21:13.149 --> 21:15.182
and you seem like the best candidate.

21:15.662 --> 21:20.320
I may not be real, but
I get a funny feeling

21:20.355 --> 21:23.823
I can still make you bleed.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.046
[Sighs]

21:33.081 --> 21:35.681
I'm sorry. I can't wake you.

21:35.717 --> 21:37.062
Not yet.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.086
Not until I find the person
who wants to harm our daughter.

21:41.122 --> 21:46.691
And, Snow, I promise you, I
will find him and I will stop him

21:46.727 --> 21:50.495
and bring Emma home where
she belongs, and we can...

21:50.530 --> 21:52.086
fix this...

21:54.301 --> 21:55.750
all of this.

22:06.290 --> 22:08.657
All right, then. Thanks, mate.

22:08.693 --> 22:10.696
The dwarfs have searched
the entire northern woods.

22:10.702 --> 22:12.468
There's no sign of our guy, or
anyone else, for that matter.

22:12.617 --> 22:13.949
Well, he couldn't have just vanished.

22:13.985 --> 22:15.116
We must have missed something.

22:15.151 --> 22:16.884
This would be so much easier
if we knew who the bloody hell

22:16.920 --> 22:18.886
we were looking for.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.822
[Door opens]
Belle: His name's Gideon.

22:21.758 --> 22:22.988
Belle.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.227
He's my son.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.062
Your son is an infant.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.463
He <i> was.</i>

22:29.499 --> 22:31.698
Then he grew up in another realm,

22:31.734 --> 22:32.866
without his parents,

22:32.901 --> 22:35.702
and that experience affected him.

22:35.738 --> 22:36.870
"Affected him"?

22:36.905 --> 22:38.238
He's trying to kill Emma.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.440
I-I know. Look, it's
not his fault, okay?

22:40.475 --> 22:42.042
He's confused and...

22:42.077 --> 22:44.077
Rumple's out there
looking for him right now.

22:44.866 --> 22:47.080
To stop him or aid him?

22:48.555 --> 22:49.949
I don't know.

22:49.984 --> 22:52.384
But I do know that <i>
I</i> can stop him.

22:52.419 --> 22:54.386
If I can just talk to
him, reason with him,

22:54.421 --> 22:55.688
as his mother...

22:57.091 --> 22:58.791
[Sighs] Will you help me?

22:58.826 --> 22:59.992
I don't know, Belle.

23:00.028 --> 23:02.094
If he's really planning to kill Emma...

23:02.130 --> 23:03.996
We're going to have to stop him.

23:04.796 --> 23:07.799
But that doesn't mean he has to be hurt.

23:07.834 --> 23:11.302
And neither one of our
children need to be harmed.

23:11.337 --> 23:15.140
Look, I came to you for
help because I trust you.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.910
Can you trust me?

23:19.914 --> 23:20.912
Let's just find him.

23:20.947 --> 23:22.313
The sooner we do, the better.

23:22.348 --> 23:26.083
Then take your shot,
but if it doesn't work...

23:26.118 --> 23:27.851
Thank you.

23:32.904 --> 23:35.258
Now, if you'll excuse
me, it's been a while

23:35.294 --> 23:36.994
since I had good flay.

23:37.029 --> 23:38.796
Tools are a bit rusty.

23:38.831 --> 23:40.830
[Giggles]

23:48.477 --> 23:50.339
So... [Clears throat]

23:50.374 --> 23:53.976
You're telling me I'm living
in a fake world that's created

23:54.012 --> 23:58.146
by the wish of a
princess who's not fake.

23:58.182 --> 24:02.851
Well, it wasn't her
wish, exactly, but yes.

24:02.886 --> 24:06.855
And in this world, I'm
some kind of folk hero,

24:06.890 --> 24:08.957
and the Evil Queen cared for me.

24:11.736 --> 24:12.994
Hmm.

24:13.030 --> 24:16.197
I'd say I did pretty well for myself.

24:16.232 --> 24:19.859
Wait, that's it? You just believe me?

24:19.865 --> 24:22.169
Do I believe that there's some
other world where I'm living

24:22.205 --> 24:25.572
a completely different life,
which, by the looks of things,

24:25.608 --> 24:27.174
is a hell of a lot better than this one?

24:27.210 --> 24:29.176
Yes. Indeed.

24:29.212 --> 24:31.544
I don't mind believing that at all.

24:33.634 --> 24:34.547
What?

24:35.368 --> 24:38.184
Am I a scoundrel over there, too?

24:38.867 --> 24:41.020
No, you're not a scoundrel.

24:47.895 --> 24:49.694
You're dead.

24:56.303 --> 24:57.903
I see.

25:05.645 --> 25:09.613
And, uh, this other Robin,

25:09.649 --> 25:15.586
before he died, did he...
Did I have a good life?

25:15.753 --> 25:17.370
I think so.

25:19.058 --> 25:20.495
I hope so.

25:22.060 --> 25:25.796
He helped a lot of people,
which he was proud of.

25:25.831 --> 25:32.002
And he loved his friends and... family.

25:34.406 --> 25:36.372
And you.

25:36.408 --> 25:38.408
And me.

25:39.544 --> 25:41.802
Well, that sounds like
it was a good life,

25:43.029 --> 25:45.214
even if it was too short.

25:56.026 --> 25:56.991
What are you doing?

25:57.027 --> 25:58.026
[Grunts]

25:58.061 --> 26:02.330
Well, it's a little-known
fact, but I'm not just

26:02.365 --> 26:04.065
the world's greatest thief.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.099
[Clicking]

26:07.206 --> 26:09.103
Shall we, Your Majesty?

26:50.177 --> 26:52.476
Emma: What's this? It had my name on it.

26:52.482 --> 26:54.679
For the princess who has everything,

26:54.714 --> 26:56.281
happy birthday.

26:57.140 --> 26:58.683
Seriously, why this?

26:58.718 --> 27:00.051
I don't know.

27:00.087 --> 27:03.021
I guess I've always liked swans.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.856
Reminds me of a story
my father used to tell me

27:05.892 --> 27:08.625
when I was dreaming of becoming real.

27:08.660 --> 27:11.695
Let me guess... "The Ugly Duckling"?

27:11.730 --> 27:13.888
Huh. You know it.

27:13.894 --> 27:15.399
Yeah, you could say that.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.135
The duck who believed so
deeply he could become a swan,

27:18.170 --> 27:20.170
he actually became one.

27:20.969 --> 27:23.806
My father always said, "Believe
hard enough in something

27:23.841 --> 27:25.508
and you can change your fate."

27:26.009 --> 27:28.011
What did you say?

27:28.046 --> 27:32.215
You can change... your fate.

27:33.851 --> 27:36.201
Boy: If we believe in
something strongly enough,

27:36.207 --> 27:38.472
we all have the power
to change our fate.

27:39.390 --> 27:40.989
It was you.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.158
What was me?

27:43.193 --> 27:46.094
When I was a kid, in my world,

27:46.678 --> 27:49.998
you gave me some advice,
and it changed my life.

27:50.004 --> 27:51.828
You became the swan.

27:53.328 --> 27:55.269
Yeah, I did.

27:56.453 --> 27:58.252
[Chuckles]

28:05.329 --> 28:07.081
You can do this.

28:08.551 --> 28:10.084
If you believe you're a puppeteer,

28:10.119 --> 28:12.518
you will be a puppeteer.

28:12.554 --> 28:14.254
But if you believe
you're a master carver

28:14.289 --> 28:16.222
and as good as your father ever was...

28:17.926 --> 28:20.626
then your fate changes.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.580
Looks like the swan is going home.

28:43.851 --> 28:47.053
[Hammering]

28:48.504 --> 28:50.471
You did it.

28:50.535 --> 28:53.002
I knew that you could.

28:53.037 --> 28:55.804
Thank you, Emma. For believing in me.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.806
I'm just repaying the favor.

28:57.842 --> 28:59.442
Your father would be proud.

29:03.947 --> 29:07.482
Well, it's a little
rough around the edges,

29:07.518 --> 29:09.083
but I think it'll do.

29:11.788 --> 29:14.623
Regina. Where did you go?

29:14.658 --> 29:16.324
Um...

29:16.360 --> 29:17.592
Oh.

29:17.628 --> 29:21.128
I'm... I'm sorry I ran off,
but we have to get out of here.

29:21.164 --> 29:22.095
They're gonna be looking for us...

29:22.131 --> 29:25.533
sheriffs and knights
and maybe Rumple, and...

29:25.568 --> 29:26.733
Is that it?

29:26.769 --> 29:28.735
This is it.

29:28.771 --> 29:31.539
That's how you're getting back? A tree?

29:31.574 --> 29:32.739
A magic tree.

29:32.775 --> 29:34.542
Oh, well, forgive me.

29:34.577 --> 29:36.976
Regina, we do have to go.

29:37.291 --> 29:39.479
Can you just give me a minute?

29:42.016 --> 29:43.550
Um...

29:44.397 --> 29:48.588
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

29:48.623 --> 29:50.390
I like an adventure.

29:50.425 --> 29:52.524
Here.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.526
I want you to have this.

29:55.387 --> 29:58.530
So a piece of Robin is with you always.

29:58.566 --> 30:00.932
[Sighs]

30:00.967 --> 30:02.901
Where did you get this?

30:02.936 --> 30:04.269
It's my lucky feather.

30:04.305 --> 30:07.439
It's from a very lucky arrow.

30:07.474 --> 30:11.242
When Robin... my Robin died,

30:11.277 --> 30:17.114
there was a feather that got
lost on its way to me from him.

30:18.229 --> 30:23.554
But despite everything, I
chose to believe and hope

30:23.590 --> 30:25.318
that he was in a good place.

30:27.959 --> 30:34.397
I think, somehow... he lives on in you.

30:35.967 --> 30:39.936
Regina, why don't you bring him?

30:41.214 --> 30:42.739
He's not real.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.140
Emma, you said it yourself.

30:45.175 --> 30:48.143
This place was created by a wish.

30:48.178 --> 30:49.886
How could a wish become real?

30:49.892 --> 30:51.037
Maybe it can.

30:51.043 --> 30:52.242
The feather.

30:52.571 --> 30:54.116
Robin's soul had to go somewhere.

30:54.151 --> 30:56.615
Maybe that's why he hasn't
aged, why he's different.

30:57.474 --> 31:02.390
If you believe any part of
him is in there, why walk away?

31:02.803 --> 31:04.475
Because, Emma, it's me.

31:08.131 --> 31:10.298
And I'm afraid of tempting fate.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.499
No.

31:11.534 --> 31:13.301
We make our own fate.

31:13.336 --> 31:16.471
I did it, and now it's your turn.

31:19.174 --> 31:21.508
[Sniffles]

31:21.543 --> 31:23.176
[Sighs]

31:24.553 --> 31:26.230
So...

31:27.058 --> 31:28.348
I'm in.

31:28.384 --> 31:29.516
[Scoffs]

31:29.551 --> 31:30.751
You are?

31:33.324 --> 31:34.687
It might not work.

31:34.722 --> 31:38.090
Then again, it might.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.938
You'd take the risk?

31:39.944 --> 31:42.686
Well, I don't know if you
caught this, but, uh...

31:42.730 --> 31:44.664
things are looking
pretty bleak for me here.

31:45.365 --> 31:48.501
And, you know, why not
get to know the woman

31:48.536 --> 31:51.136
one version of me was
willing to die for?

31:59.477 --> 32:02.380
Maybe you should leave this here.

32:02.416 --> 32:03.981
No.

32:04.017 --> 32:07.485
I can't let fate dictate
my actions anymore.

32:12.867 --> 32:14.525
Thank you.

32:18.698 --> 32:21.298
[Thunder rumbling]

32:21.334 --> 32:23.934
[Insects chirping]

32:34.313 --> 32:35.545
Regina?

32:37.067 --> 32:38.581
Are you okay?

32:38.616 --> 32:40.049
Where's Robin?

32:42.497 --> 32:46.042
I don't know. We... went in together.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.828
I'm so sorry.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.765
[Sighs]

32:56.800 --> 32:57.999
Can I...

32:58.034 --> 33:00.668
Can I have a moment alone, please?

33:16.985 --> 33:20.387
[Sighs]

33:20.422 --> 33:22.589
[Explosion]

33:40.741 --> 33:42.374
Sorry.

33:42.410 --> 33:44.410
No, it's all right.

33:46.226 --> 33:50.115
So, where exactly are we?

33:58.758 --> 34:01.392
Robin of Locksley,

34:01.428 --> 34:05.396
as mayor, I'd like to officially
welcome you to Storybrooke.

34:27.831 --> 34:29.864
Gideon: Savior.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.071
I've been waiting.

34:36.106 --> 34:37.621
Who are you?

34:39.324 --> 34:41.034
My name is Gideon.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.733
I only know one Gideon.

34:48.007 --> 34:50.608
He looks a lot younger than you do.

34:52.911 --> 34:55.513
What do you want?

34:58.251 --> 34:59.617
[Both grunting]

35:03.054 --> 35:04.287
[Groans]

35:06.958 --> 35:08.325
[Grunting]

35:19.957 --> 35:20.879
Henry: Mom!

35:20.885 --> 35:21.951
Emma!

35:24.363 --> 35:25.462
Stay back!

35:26.640 --> 35:28.677
Gideon! Wait!

35:29.413 --> 35:30.897
You don't have to do this.

35:30.903 --> 35:32.703
It's okay. I'm not gonna
let him hurt anyone.

35:41.133 --> 35:44.835
I'm not going to hurt them... just you.

35:57.175 --> 35:59.248
Ready to die, Savior?

36:00.878 --> 36:04.486
I am fated to die, and I will die.

36:07.658 --> 36:09.257
But not today.

36:15.132 --> 36:18.299
[Grunting]

36:22.405 --> 36:25.472
I'm still going to kill you.

36:25.507 --> 36:27.831
Gold: Please.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.329
He's my son.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.314
I don't need your help!

36:38.520 --> 36:40.320
Mom! You did it!

36:40.356 --> 36:42.011
[Sighs]

36:42.017 --> 36:43.456
You're amazing, Emma.

36:43.491 --> 36:45.291
[Sighs]

36:45.326 --> 36:46.292
Thank God you're alive.

36:46.327 --> 36:49.162
You, too, Dad. You, too.

36:49.197 --> 36:51.998
Really. Thank you.

36:54.435 --> 36:55.501
Good work, Emma.

36:55.536 --> 36:57.303
What happened here?

36:57.338 --> 37:00.172
Was that really Gold and Belle's baby?

37:00.207 --> 37:01.406
We'll fill you in later.

37:01.441 --> 37:03.227
Hopefully, he won't be back for a while.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.043
Robin Hood: Captain Hook?

37:05.531 --> 37:07.038
Well, you were certainly
a little more spry

37:07.044 --> 37:08.709
in your younger days.

37:09.611 --> 37:10.382
Robin?

37:10.417 --> 37:12.751
Well, not <i> really</i> Robin.

37:12.787 --> 37:15.187
Sort of. It's an alternate reality.

37:15.222 --> 37:17.755
Copies of everyone.

37:17.962 --> 37:19.739
I brought him back.

37:21.724 --> 37:24.028
"Alternate reality"? Not... Not spry?

37:24.063 --> 37:26.397
What happened to you?
What happened to me?

37:26.432 --> 37:28.133
It's okay. It's all gonna be fine.

37:28.212 --> 37:31.146
We're just... We're
gonna switch to water.

37:31.181 --> 37:32.313
What, for drinking?

37:32.349 --> 37:34.014
[Sighs] Yeah.

37:36.352 --> 37:38.485
[Keys clacking]

37:47.029 --> 37:48.562
Whoa.

37:48.597 --> 37:49.979
I could hear you all
the way down the street.

37:49.985 --> 37:52.885
I wasn't sure if I should expect
a typewriter or a tommy gun.

37:54.721 --> 37:58.705
Well, I work out here so papa can sleep.

38:02.310 --> 38:03.876
Did you know?

38:04.364 --> 38:07.341
When I was a kid and you told
me to go to the police station,

38:07.347 --> 38:08.854
did you know it was me?

38:12.352 --> 38:15.687
Of course I knew it was you.

38:16.216 --> 38:18.490
I kept tabs on you for a while.

38:18.525 --> 38:20.259
I knew you didn't belong on the streets.

38:20.294 --> 38:24.929
I just had to make
sure you knew it, too.

38:26.419 --> 38:27.564
Thanks.

38:30.210 --> 38:33.905
I, uh, kept the... kept the pages.

38:34.710 --> 38:35.897
Hmm.

38:38.116 --> 38:42.245
You know, when you picked
Swan, it made me happy.

38:43.324 --> 38:45.849
I figured it meant that you got it.

38:45.884 --> 38:48.051
That you were on your
way to becoming the person

38:48.086 --> 38:50.187
that you wanted to be.

38:50.222 --> 38:52.355
I don't know if I totally got it.

38:52.794 --> 38:56.126
I don't know if I still do.

38:56.825 --> 39:00.129
But I think I'm on my way
to believing I can make

39:00.164 --> 39:01.328
my own destiny.

39:01.378 --> 39:02.461
Well...

39:04.635 --> 39:08.770
belief is the first step.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.314
Making a wish?

39:20.501 --> 39:22.416
I better not.

39:22.452 --> 39:25.753
My hopes and plans don't
turn out like I want them to.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.756
No matter what I do, who I trust.

39:29.002 --> 39:30.969
I understand the feeling.

39:31.284 --> 39:32.127
Do you?

39:33.393 --> 39:36.563
'Cause, I mean, clearly
you wanted to keep him tied

39:36.598 --> 39:38.830
to this horrible fate,
and you succeeded.

39:38.836 --> 39:41.792
I wanted his life to
take its natural course.

39:46.491 --> 39:49.319
He still has the power
to change his choices,

39:49.858 --> 39:51.759
like the Savior's doing.

39:53.439 --> 39:55.848
But using the Shears would
have robbed him of that.

39:55.884 --> 40:01.620
And, yes, I was gonna
use them on him before,

40:02.092 --> 40:03.726
but I was wrong.

40:04.175 --> 40:07.097
And you think he'll make
the right choices now?

40:08.295 --> 40:09.428
No.

40:10.637 --> 40:12.370
But I hope he still may.

40:14.897 --> 40:17.298
I know you don't believe
that's what I want, Belle,

40:17.304 --> 40:18.770
but it's true.

40:19.132 --> 40:23.156
When Baelfire rejected
my magic, I respected it.

40:24.335 --> 40:26.703
I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.

40:28.874 --> 40:35.152
My whole dark life, I've sought
out those who are light...

40:35.609 --> 40:37.054
like you.

40:37.089 --> 40:40.489
So, what, you don't
want him to kill Emma?

40:40.727 --> 40:42.660
No, I don't.

40:43.101 --> 40:47.326
That would be an irrational act
of someone so blind with pain

40:47.332 --> 40:50.633
they think they're
reaching for the cure...

40:51.113 --> 40:53.970
when, in fact, it's just more poison.

40:54.722 --> 40:56.293
I know.

40:57.691 --> 40:59.300
I've done it myself.

41:01.378 --> 41:03.511
Frankly, I suppose I'm addicted to it,

41:03.547 --> 41:05.311
but I don't want it for my son.

41:16.059 --> 41:17.391
[Splash]

41:18.358 --> 41:20.268
I protected him,

41:20.651 --> 41:23.860
even knowing what he wanted to do.

41:24.546 --> 41:27.080
[Scoffs] Yeah.

41:27.108 --> 41:31.976
It can be easy to rationalize
doing the wrong thing, can't it?

41:33.980 --> 41:35.674
Indeed it can.

41:38.046 --> 41:40.613
Is it too late for us to help him?

41:40.648 --> 41:44.784
You must have some plan, some trick.

41:44.819 --> 41:46.619
I'm sorry.

41:46.654 --> 41:53.425
But if there is anything
we can do to help him,

41:53.461 --> 41:57.229
perhaps that's something
we should do together.

41:57.264 --> 42:01.300
Not just for us, but for everyone.
