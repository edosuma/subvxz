02:36.402 --> 02:37.733
I was dreamin'.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.403
Dreamin' my dick was out
and I was checking to see

02:41.474 --> 02:44.807
if that infected bump on the head
of it had filled with pus again.

02:44.877 --> 02:47.641
If it had, I was gonna name
that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla

02:47.713 --> 02:49.806
and bust it by jackin' off.

02:49.882 --> 02:50.940
Oh, man.

02:51.016 --> 02:52.847
Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do.

02:53.753 --> 02:56.017
Dreams let you think like that.

02:56.088 --> 03:00.548
Truth was, I hadn't had
a hard-on in years.

03:23.449 --> 03:24.939
Oh, man.

03:56.916 --> 04:00.408
My God, man.
How long have I been here?

04:00.486 --> 04:03.978
Am I really awake now,
or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?

04:04.056 --> 04:07.219
How could my plans
have gone so wrong?

04:07.293 --> 04:09.454
When the hell are they
gonna serve lunch?

04:09.528 --> 04:12.258
Considerin' what they serve,
why the hell do I care?

04:13.899 --> 04:17.733
If Priscilla discovered I was alive,
would she come and see me?

04:17.803 --> 04:22.069
Would we still wanna fuck?
Or would we merely have to talk about it?

04:22.141 --> 04:23.870
Is there, finally and really,

04:23.943 --> 04:27.276
anything to life other than
food, shit, and sex?

04:35.020 --> 04:36.681
Well, goddamnit.

04:39.525 --> 04:42.688
How could I have gone from
the "King of rock and roll"to this?

04:43.395 --> 04:47.058
Old guy in a rest home in East Texas
with a growth on his pecker.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.275
And what is that growth, man?

05:07.353 --> 05:10.083
Cancer? Nobody's talkin'.

05:10.689 --> 05:13.681
No one seems to know...
or wants to.

06:16.922 --> 06:19.584
Makes you wonder, doesn't it,
what kind of life this old guy had?

06:20.726 --> 06:24.560
Whathat kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.

06:24.630 --> 06:25.790
Look at him now.

06:25.864 --> 06:27.525
Oh, who gives a shit?

07:09.575 --> 07:10.906
Well...

07:21.787 --> 07:23.448
Make you comfortable.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.124
No.

09:12.231 --> 09:14.791
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!

10:18.997 --> 10:20.487
Help me.

11:11.850 --> 11:13.681
You know, I was thinkin'...

11:13.752 --> 11:16.915
What? You gonna get
all weepy on me again?

11:16.989 --> 11:20.982
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you
use some of this here deodorizer

11:21.059 --> 11:24.551
and spray it on that corpse
because she's smellin' pretty ripe.

11:28.267 --> 11:29.598
Good idea.

12:41.473 --> 12:42.770
Excuse me, miss?

12:44.276 --> 12:45.504
You gonna throw all that stuff out?

12:46.511 --> 12:47.569
Yeah.

12:47.646 --> 12:50.479
Could I have one
of them pictures of Bull?

12:50.983 --> 12:53.315
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?

12:54.186 --> 12:56.848
I mean,
he was pretty proud of that.

12:56.922 --> 13:00.619
And maybe that... that tin
of chocolates there?

13:02.694 --> 13:04.025
I suppose.

13:09.167 --> 13:13.331
The revealin' of her panties
wasn't intentional or unintentional.

13:13.405 --> 13:14.895
She just didn't give a damn.

13:14.973 --> 13:18.033
She saw me as so physically
and sexually non-threatenin',

13:18.110 --> 13:21.375
she didn't mind if I got
a bird's-eye view of her love nest.

13:21.446 --> 13:24.176
It was the same to her
as a house cat sneakin' a peek.

13:25.250 --> 13:29.084
I felt my pecker flutter once like
a pigeon havin' a heart attack...

13:29.821 --> 13:32.415
then it laid back down
and remained limp and still.

13:33.091 --> 13:36.151
'Course, these days, even a flutter
was kind of reassurin'.

13:38.930 --> 13:40.261
- Here.
- Thank you.

13:40.332 --> 13:41.993
Say...

13:42.801 --> 13:44.063
Bull your kin?

13:44.136 --> 13:45.296
My daddy.

13:47.706 --> 13:49.503
Never seen you here before.

13:50.308 --> 13:53.903
I've only been here once before.
Whenhen I checked him in.

13:54.946 --> 13:56.777
That's three years ago, wasn't it?

13:58.250 --> 13:59.581
You and him friends?

13:59.651 --> 14:02.848
No, we just roommates. I mean,
he never felt good enough to say much.

14:03.488 --> 14:06.651
I just hated to see what
was left of him go away so easy.

14:09.061 --> 14:11.393
Seemed like an all right guy.

14:11.463 --> 14:15.399
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?

14:15.467 --> 14:16.957
Yeah.

14:17.035 --> 14:19.367
Well... he was all right.

14:20.305 --> 14:22.500
But not enough so you'd
come and see him, though.

14:23.341 --> 14:26.833
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.

14:26.912 --> 14:30.575
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid
or Medicare... whatever that stuff was...

14:30.649 --> 14:32.549
he'd have been
in some ditch somewhere.

14:35.053 --> 14:37.544
And I sure didn't have the money
to take care of him.

14:41.359 --> 14:42.690
My own daughter...

14:43.361 --> 14:45.795
Iost long ago to me...

14:45.864 --> 14:48.799
if she knew I lived,
would she come and see me?

14:48.867 --> 14:50.266
Would she even care?

14:51.236 --> 14:54.728
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.839
Mind your own business.

14:58.276 --> 14:59.766
I was busy.

15:14.793 --> 15:18.490
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.

15:18.563 --> 15:20.554
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?

15:20.632 --> 15:22.293
I'm all right.

15:22.367 --> 15:25.768
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.328
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?

15:28.940 --> 15:30.669
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.

15:30.742 --> 15:33.677
Well, of course I knew that.
I forgot.

15:33.745 --> 15:36.077
Good morning, Elvis.

15:37.983 --> 15:41.714
Did you knowwe have
a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?

15:41.786 --> 15:44.914
Elvis Presley. You know,
the rock and roll singer.

15:46.424 --> 15:48.085
I thought he was dead.

15:49.427 --> 15:53.090
Well, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?

15:53.165 --> 15:56.430
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.298
Yet.

15:58.370 --> 16:01.203
Now, Mr. Haff!

16:01.273 --> 16:03.935
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."

16:04.009 --> 16:06.842
But you're a little confused
and you like to play sometimes.

16:06.912 --> 16:11.781
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?

16:13.818 --> 16:16.787
You fell off the stage
and broke your hip... when was it?

16:16.855 --> 16:18.345
Twenty years ago.

16:18.423 --> 16:22.257
It got infected and you were
in a coma for quite a while.

16:22.327 --> 16:26.661
You came out with a few...
problems.

16:28.967 --> 16:32.698
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.

16:32.771 --> 16:34.102
I don't have any problems.

16:34.172 --> 16:36.265
You're tryin' to say
my brain's messed up, aren't you?

16:36.341 --> 16:38.832
Whyhy would you
wanna be somebody else?

16:39.844 --> 16:41.004
I got tired of it.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.904
I was hooked on pills, you know.

16:43.982 --> 16:45.574
I wanted out.

16:45.650 --> 16:48.380
And this boy Sebastian Haff...
he was an Elvis imitator.

16:48.453 --> 16:51.286
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.

16:52.023 --> 16:53.752
Problem is, he had a bad heart.

16:54.593 --> 16:56.925
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.

16:56.995 --> 17:01.022
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.

17:01.566 --> 17:04.967
But why would you want
to leave all that fame, Mr. Presley?

17:05.637 --> 17:07.627
All that money?

17:07.705 --> 17:10.038
I don't know.
'Cause they got old.

17:13.645 --> 17:18.138
The woman I loved... Priscilla...
she was gone.

17:18.215 --> 17:20.877
The rest of the women...
werejust women.

17:22.487 --> 17:25.047
I mean, the music
wasn't mine anymore.

17:25.123 --> 17:28.115
I wasn't even me anymore.
Just this thing they made up.

17:30.795 --> 17:32.126
And my friends...

17:34.733 --> 17:36.564
Well, they were suckin' me dry.

17:41.273 --> 17:43.935
So I took a little road trip
down to Nacogdoches...

17:44.943 --> 17:48.936
to check out this Sebastian Haff.

18:35.994 --> 18:37.655
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.

19:01.653 --> 19:02.813
Oh, my God.

19:07.459 --> 19:09.290
I didn't think you'd really...

19:31.383 --> 19:34.716
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.

19:36.221 --> 19:37.381
Let's split.

19:50.268 --> 19:52.668
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.

19:52.737 --> 19:54.068
It's all yours, baby.

20:02.981 --> 20:05.848
So I signed everything
over to Sebastian.

20:05.917 --> 20:09.409
Except for enough money
to sustain me if things got bad.

20:09.487 --> 20:12.513
I was determined
to make myself a new life.

20:12.590 --> 20:13.921
A better one.

20:16.261 --> 20:18.923
But me and Sebastian,
we had us a deal.

20:20.999 --> 20:22.990
If I wanted to trade back, he'd let me.

20:24.235 --> 20:26.226
It was all written up in the contract.

20:27.305 --> 20:28.897
The thing was...

20:28.973 --> 20:31.464
I lost my copy
in a barbeque accident.

20:32.777 --> 20:34.369
But that wasn't so bad, either.

20:34.446 --> 20:37.609
I was makin' new friends
and enjoyin' myself.

20:40.185 --> 20:41.345
Cheers!

20:51.930 --> 20:54.990
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?

20:58.436 --> 20:59.926
It just went up like that.

21:00.872 --> 21:04.069
- Now, Elvis.
- Yes?

21:06.277 --> 21:08.336
Don't carry it too far.

21:08.413 --> 21:12.406
You may just get way out there
and not come back.

21:13.551 --> 21:15.041
Oh, fuck you.

21:17.055 --> 21:18.545
Shit.

21:18.623 --> 21:22.115
Get old, you can't even cuss
someone and have it bother 'em.

21:22.193 --> 21:26.186
Everything you do is either
worthless or sadly amusing.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.398
Well...

21:28.466 --> 21:30.297
I've got what I want.

21:31.169 --> 21:34.002
The clothes can go
to Goodwill or Salvation Army.

21:34.072 --> 21:38.702
V ery well. And I'm sorry about
your father. He was a nice man.

21:38.776 --> 21:40.243
Yeah.

21:41.012 --> 21:43.003
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.

21:43.081 --> 21:45.276
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.

21:46.618 --> 21:52.488
I'll be back later to do that little... thing
that has to be done. You know.

21:57.128 --> 21:58.186
Elvis!

22:08.873 --> 22:10.033
Poor Bull.

22:12.043 --> 22:16.207
In the end...
does anything really matter?

22:20.385 --> 22:22.376
No one here ever listened to me.

22:23.054 --> 22:27.457
Except this one guy...
only, he was certifiable.

22:27.525 --> 22:29.720
That's where they took
a piece of my brain.

22:29.794 --> 22:33.252
They got it back in D.C.
in that goddamn jar.

22:35.199 --> 22:38.259
I got a little bag of sand
up there now.

22:39.337 --> 22:41.828
Jack... no offense, but...

22:42.907 --> 22:44.841
President Kennedy was a white man.

22:44.909 --> 22:46.900
That's how clever they are!

22:46.978 --> 22:49.970
They dyed me this color.
All over!

22:50.048 --> 22:53.449
Can you think of a better way
to hide the truth than that?

23:51.909 --> 23:53.570
I was livin' simple.

23:54.779 --> 23:56.474
The way Haff had been.

23:56.547 --> 23:59.539
Going from town to town
doin' the Elvis act.

24:00.451 --> 24:02.851
Only, I felt like I
was really me again.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.251
Can you dig that?

24:04.322 --> 24:07.587
We're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.

24:45.596 --> 24:47.086
Women were
throwin' themselves at me

24:47.165 --> 24:49.099
'cause they could imagine I was Elvis.

24:49.167 --> 24:53.035
Only, I was Elvis playing
Sebastian Haff playing Elvis.

24:53.104 --> 24:54.594
It was all pretty good.

24:54.672 --> 24:56.765
I didn't mind the contract
being burned up.

24:56.841 --> 24:59.002
Didn't even try to go back
and convince anybody.

25:01.212 --> 25:02.839
Then I had the accident.

25:02.914 --> 25:06.145
I was gyratin', see, takin' care business,
and then my hip went out.

25:07.785 --> 25:09.514
I'd been havin' trouble with it.

25:26.370 --> 25:28.167
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.

25:39.050 --> 25:42.213
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.

25:43.321 --> 25:45.721
No more piss or crap
in the bed.

26:11.382 --> 26:12.713
Shake it out...

26:22.627 --> 26:23.958
There we go.

26:57.895 --> 27:02.093
Man... that is one
big bitch cockroach.

27:34.799 --> 27:36.061
All right, man. Let's go.

27:45.076 --> 27:46.566
Damn.

27:50.615 --> 27:52.344
Hot damn!

28:21.412 --> 28:23.744
Got you, you six-legged bastard.

29:04.722 --> 29:08.385
Even a big bitch cockroach
like you should know...

29:09.760 --> 29:14.254
Never... but never fuck with the King.

29:32.483 --> 29:35.646
Hey! Is anybody out here?

29:40.424 --> 29:43.257
I think we got some major
bug problems in this place, man!

30:50.561 --> 30:52.495
Oh, man...

30:54.065 --> 30:55.123
Hey, Jack?

31:06.944 --> 31:08.275
Hey, man, you okay?

31:15.286 --> 31:17.777
What the Sam Hill is that?

31:21.192 --> 31:22.352
Mr. Kennedy?

31:29.500 --> 31:32.663
Hey, man...
you're on the floor.

31:34.071 --> 31:35.299
No shit.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.868
Who are you?

31:38.876 --> 31:40.036
Look, I'm...

31:41.412 --> 31:44.472
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.

31:45.282 --> 31:47.876
Did you see him go by in the hall?

31:49.186 --> 31:51.347
He scuttled like.

31:52.156 --> 31:54.818
- Who, man?
- The one they sent.

31:55.759 --> 31:59.217
- Who's "they"?
- Oh, you knowwho.

31:59.296 --> 32:01.025
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.831
Lyndon Johnson.

32:04.902 --> 32:06.392
Castro, maybe.

32:06.470 --> 32:09.462
They sent somebody to finish me off.

32:09.540 --> 32:12.703
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.

32:12.776 --> 32:16.803
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!

32:16.881 --> 32:19.145
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.

32:19.216 --> 32:22.708
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.

32:27.925 --> 32:29.085
Get his feet.

32:35.099 --> 32:37.158
So, you say you heard a... a noise?

32:38.269 --> 32:41.102
Well, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.

32:41.172 --> 32:45.575
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.

32:45.643 --> 32:48.168
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.

32:49.079 --> 32:53.072
Were you awake or were you
in bed when you heard this noise?

32:53.150 --> 32:56.984
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.

32:57.054 --> 32:58.885
You got bugs all over this place.

33:00.057 --> 33:04.756
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind
of bugs have you been seeing?

33:04.828 --> 33:07.228
Look, do I look like
an ichthyologist to you?

33:07.298 --> 33:08.458
Big damn bugs, all right?

33:08.532 --> 33:11.695
The size of my fist. The size
of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.

33:11.769 --> 33:14.101
What do I care?
I got a growtth on my pecker.

33:14.171 --> 33:16.332
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.

33:16.407 --> 33:19.843
We'll call the exterminator tomorrow
and we'll take care of the problem.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.741
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.497
It's time for that little thing again.

34:14.764 --> 34:18.326
A doll like this handlin' me
without warmth or emotion...

34:18.402 --> 34:20.393
Twenty years ago.
Just twenty, man.

34:20.471 --> 34:24.134
I could've made with the curly-lip smile
and had her eatin' out of my asshole.

34:24.742 --> 34:29.475
Doctor says this cream
ought to do the trick.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.706
Corticosteroids.

34:31.782 --> 34:35.513
Should heal the inflammation,
stop the pus.

34:37.054 --> 34:38.612
Where'd my youth go?

34:39.956 --> 34:42.891
Why didn't fame
hold off old age and death?

34:42.960 --> 34:45.621
Why the hell did I leave
the fame in the first place?

34:45.696 --> 34:47.357
Do I want it back?
Could I have it back?

34:47.431 --> 34:50.922
And if I could...
would it make any damn difference?

35:12.589 --> 35:15.080
Mr. Haff!

35:21.799 --> 35:23.664
Lord almighty.

35:24.902 --> 35:27.996
You old rascal.

35:30.274 --> 35:33.732
I think you better take
a cold shower, Mr. Haff.

35:34.511 --> 35:38.311
There'd been two presidential elections
since I had a boner like that one.

35:38.382 --> 35:39.872
What gave here?

35:39.950 --> 35:41.850
Then I realized what gave.

35:41.919 --> 35:44.114
I was thinkin' about something
that interested me.

35:44.188 --> 35:46.247
Not my next meal
or goin' to the crapper.

35:47.024 --> 35:49.356
I'd been given a dose of life again.

35:53.964 --> 35:56.330
You get in there with me,
I'll take that shower.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.891
You silly thing.

35:58.969 --> 36:01.529
Come on, now.
Why don't you pull on it a little?

36:03.307 --> 36:05.571
You ought to be ashamed.

36:39.576 --> 36:43.774
Where at? Where at?

36:43.847 --> 36:45.075
I haven't seen my kids.

36:45.149 --> 36:46.309
It's an ambush!

36:48.786 --> 36:51.914
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.

36:53.157 --> 36:56.024
It's an ambush!
Tonto, my boots, Tonto!

36:56.093 --> 36:59.824
That's my friend Kemosabe.
We used to play cards together.

36:59.897 --> 37:02.889
- My boots!
- Now he doesn't even know who I am.

38:01.258 --> 38:02.418
Daddy.

38:07.531 --> 38:08.691
Baby?

38:15.806 --> 38:19.640
Sebastian. Sebastian! It's loose!

38:19.710 --> 38:20.870
What's loose?

38:20.944 --> 38:22.536
lt. Listen.

38:32.990 --> 38:35.584
Jesus Christ. What's that?

38:35.659 --> 38:38.628
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson,
but I was wrong.

38:38.695 --> 38:42.256
I've come across new evidence
to suggest another assassin.

38:43.901 --> 38:45.061
Assassin?

38:45.135 --> 38:47.729
He's after another target tonight.

38:47.804 --> 38:49.704
Come on, I wanna show you something.

38:49.773 --> 38:52.241
I don't think it's safe
if you go back to sleeping.

38:52.309 --> 38:54.937
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.

38:56.513 --> 38:59.607
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!

38:59.683 --> 39:03.983
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas,
and look where they got my brain and me.

39:04.054 --> 39:07.046
I'm thinkin' with sand here.

39:07.124 --> 39:10.287
I mean, I pick up some waves,
maybe, from my brain,

39:10.360 --> 39:12.191
but someday, who knows.

39:12.262 --> 39:15.425
Somebody might just disconnect
the battery at the White House.

39:15.499 --> 39:18.662
Oh, yeah. That's something
to worry about, all right.

39:21.371 --> 39:23.601
Listen here. Listen.

39:23.674 --> 39:25.505
I know you're Elvis.

39:33.050 --> 39:37.714
There was a rumor, you know,
that you hated me.

39:37.788 --> 39:39.187
But I thought about that.

39:41.725 --> 39:44.717
If you hated me, you could've
finished me off the other night.

39:46.563 --> 39:50.397
What I want from you is
that you look me straight in the eye

39:50.467 --> 39:55.632
and assure me you had nothing
at all to do with that day in Dallas,

39:55.706 --> 39:59.767
and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.

40:07.584 --> 40:09.245
Look, man...

40:09.319 --> 40:11.480
I had nothing to do with Dallas.

40:11.555 --> 40:15.116
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.

40:15.959 --> 40:20.692
Good. May I call you Elvis
instead of Sebastian?

40:21.365 --> 40:22.559
You may.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.123
Excellent.

40:24.201 --> 40:25.862
You wear glasses to read?

40:25.936 --> 40:28.427
Well, I wear glasses
when I really want to see.

40:28.505 --> 40:30.496
Get them. Come on.

40:35.612 --> 40:38.103
Come on.
Right down the hall.

40:40.684 --> 40:43.152
The walker was
swingin' along easier now.

40:43.220 --> 40:44.551
Not even like I needed it.

40:45.355 --> 40:47.516
Damn, this here Jack was a nut.

40:48.258 --> 40:50.249
Maybe I was nuts, too...

40:50.327 --> 40:52.557
but there was
an adventure goin' on.

40:52.629 --> 40:53.721
It's in here.

41:00.404 --> 41:01.462
In here.

41:13.183 --> 41:14.514
That's it?

41:14.584 --> 41:18.145
We're investigating a scuttling in the hall,
trying to figure out who attacked you,

41:18.221 --> 41:21.054
and you bring me here to look
at stick pictures on the shit house wall?

41:21.124 --> 41:22.648
Look close.

41:42.145 --> 41:43.305
It's Egyptian.

41:43.380 --> 41:44.779
Right-a-reen-o.

41:44.848 --> 41:48.784
Hey, you're not as stupid
as some folks made you out.

41:48.852 --> 41:53.812
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.

41:53.890 --> 41:58.418
I came in here to take a shit because
they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.

41:58.495 --> 42:01.828
Saw that on the wall,
took it back to my room,

42:01.898 --> 42:04.594
looked it up in my books,
and I wrote it all down.

42:04.668 --> 42:10.664
Now, this top line
translates roughly into,

42:10.741 --> 42:14.575
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."

42:14.644 --> 42:19.138
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."

42:19.216 --> 42:20.274
Say what?

42:20.350 --> 42:23.080
Well, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.

42:24.187 --> 42:27.679
All right, so, one of the nuts in here...
present company excluded...

42:27.758 --> 42:30.591
thinks he's Tutankhamen,
comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.

42:30.660 --> 42:33.754
Big deal! What's the connection?
Why are we standin' here in the toilet?

42:33.830 --> 42:37.231
Well, I don't knowwhat
the connection is, exactly... not yet.

42:37.300 --> 42:40.895
But that thing
caught me asleep last night.

42:40.971 --> 42:43.462
And I came awake just in time.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.269
He had me on the floor.

42:45.342 --> 42:49.039
I had his mouth over my asshole.

42:49.112 --> 42:50.272
A shit-eater?

42:50.347 --> 42:51.837
I don't think so.

42:51.915 --> 42:54.645
He was after my soul.

42:54.718 --> 42:58.586
Now, you can get that out of any
major orifice of a person's body.

42:58.655 --> 42:59.713
I read about it.

42:59.790 --> 43:01.849
Yeah? Where, man? Hustler?

43:01.925 --> 43:05.861
The Everyday Man Or Woman's
Book of the Soul by David Webb.

43:05.929 --> 43:08.159
And they got pretty good
movie reviews in there

43:08.231 --> 43:11.166
about stolen soul movies
in the back.

43:11.234 --> 43:13.259
Come on. I'll show you.

44:12.562 --> 44:17.124
I think that there might be some sort
of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.135
That light...
looks like it's shortin' out.

44:20.203 --> 44:22.797
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.

44:22.873 --> 44:25.034
But you don't have to think about that.

44:25.108 --> 44:28.100
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin'
on her enema.

44:29.145 --> 44:32.046
All right. All right. I'm comin'.

44:34.084 --> 44:37.144
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.

44:38.088 --> 44:39.248
God.

45:31.174 --> 45:32.869
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.

45:42.619 --> 45:45.213
Damn! Hey, Jack.

45:45.288 --> 45:48.451
What it says here
is that you can bury some dude,

45:48.525 --> 45:53.519
and if he gets the right tanna leaves
and spells said over him and such bullshit,

45:53.596 --> 45:56.929
that he can come back to life
thousands of years later, man.

45:57.667 --> 45:58.725
But hold on, now.

45:58.802 --> 46:02.568
To stay alive, he has to suck
on the souls of the livin',

46:02.639 --> 46:06.302
and that if the souls are small,
his life force doesn't last long.

46:07.077 --> 46:09.238
Small.
What's that mean?

46:09.312 --> 46:11.803
Read on.
No, never mind.

46:11.881 --> 46:13.542
I'll tell you myself.

46:14.284 --> 46:17.082
But first,
would you like a Ding Dong?

46:18.488 --> 46:19.978
I don't mean mine.

46:20.857 --> 46:22.518
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.

46:23.393 --> 46:26.851
Of course, mine would be chocolate
now that I have been dyed.

46:26.930 --> 46:28.454
You got Ding Dongs, man?

46:29.599 --> 46:32.591
I got Paydays
and I got a box of Baby Ruths.

46:32.669 --> 46:34.000
Oh, mama!

46:35.839 --> 46:39.434
Which will it be?
Let's get decadent.

46:40.443 --> 46:41.705
I'll take a Baby Ruth.

46:44.447 --> 46:45.914
All right.

46:47.751 --> 46:51.118
Now... small souls...

46:52.155 --> 46:55.818
are those that don't have
much fire for life.

46:55.892 --> 46:57.359
You know a place like that?

46:57.427 --> 47:01.420
Man, if souls were fires,
they couldn't burn much lower than in here.

47:01.498 --> 47:03.261
Exactamundo.

47:03.333 --> 47:08.669
What we have here at Shady Rest
is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.

47:08.738 --> 47:11.229
You know, a mummy hiding out.

47:11.307 --> 47:14.799
Coming in here,
feeding on the sleeping.

47:14.878 --> 47:17.039
It's perfect, you see?

47:17.113 --> 47:20.776
We're small souls,
so we can't provide him much.

47:21.451 --> 47:25.854
But if that thing comes back
two or three times in a row

47:25.922 --> 47:30.621
and wraps his lips
around some elder's asshole,

47:30.693 --> 47:34.424
that elder is going to die pretty soon.

47:34.497 --> 47:36.863
And who would be the wiser?

47:56.853 --> 47:58.184
Asshole.

48:00.223 --> 48:03.590
A mummy can't be getting
too much energy from all this...

48:03.660 --> 48:07.790
not like with big souls...
but the prey is easy.

48:08.331 --> 48:12.825
With new people comin' all the time, he can
keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.

48:12.902 --> 48:14.631
That's what they
brought us here for...

48:14.704 --> 48:17.298
to get us out of the way
until we die.

48:17.373 --> 48:23.209
And those who don't die first from
disease or just plain being old, he gets.

48:23.780 --> 48:27.614
Look, that's all well and good, Jack,
but there's one thing that still throws me.

48:28.718 --> 48:32.814
How does an ancient Egyptian
wind up in an East Texas rest home,

48:32.889 --> 48:36.120
and why is he writin'
on the shit house walls, man?

48:36.192 --> 48:38.683
Well, he went in to take a crap,

48:38.761 --> 48:41.628
got bored,
started writing on the walls.

48:41.698 --> 48:45.099
He probably wrote
on pyramid walls centuries ago.

48:45.168 --> 48:48.137
Come on. What would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.

48:48.204 --> 48:50.365
Well, he eats souls.

48:50.440 --> 48:54.206
So, I assume
that he would crap soul residue.

48:54.277 --> 48:58.179
By that, I would mean
that if you die from his mouth,

48:58.248 --> 49:01.240
you don't go to the other side
where the souls go.

49:01.317 --> 49:06.414
He digests souls
until they don't exist anymore.

49:06.489 --> 49:10.323
And you're just so much
toilet water decoration.

49:10.393 --> 49:12.759
And speaking of toilets...

49:12.829 --> 49:16.287
This is how I figured
that whole thing out.

49:17.167 --> 49:20.398
He's just like anybody else
when it comes to taking a dump.

49:20.470 --> 49:22.961
He wants a nice,
clean place with a flush.

49:23.039 --> 49:24.870
They didn't have that in his time.

49:48.765 --> 49:50.824
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.

49:50.900 --> 49:54.700
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.

49:54.771 --> 49:58.332
"He" my ass. There isn't
any mummy from Egypt.

50:02.378 --> 50:04.437
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.

52:26.456 --> 52:27.616
Asshole.

53:35.024 --> 53:38.357
Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart
before he hit the floor.

53:41.164 --> 53:43.655
Gone down and out
with both guns blazing.

53:44.367 --> 53:46.767
Soul intact.

53:50.873 --> 53:53.137
Once again, we got scolded.

53:55.211 --> 53:58.146
This time, we got quizzed about
what had happened to Kemosabe,

53:58.214 --> 54:00.614
but neither of us told the truth.

54:02.218 --> 54:04.379
I mean, who was gonna believe
a couple of nuts?

54:05.655 --> 54:07.486
Elvis and Jack Kennedy explaining

54:07.557 --> 54:10.617
that Kemosabe was gunning
for a mummy in cowboy duds?

54:10.693 --> 54:13.355
Some kind of Bubba Ho-Tep?

54:14.630 --> 54:16.029
So, what we did was...

54:17.567 --> 54:18.727
we lied.

55:03.179 --> 55:05.010
Life sure is fleetin', you know?

55:05.081 --> 55:08.414
- What?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.

55:08.484 --> 55:11.146
One minute you're here,
and the next minute you're gone...

55:13.022 --> 55:15.183
Shit! Shit! Come on!

55:17.126 --> 55:19.458
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!

55:23.666 --> 55:25.327
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.

55:25.401 --> 55:26.459
Nonchalant.

55:27.503 --> 55:28.663
Get it in there.

55:31.007 --> 55:32.838
You are one fuckin' idiot.

56:01.037 --> 56:02.197
Mr. Haff?

56:04.874 --> 56:06.603
Mr. Presley?

56:11.047 --> 56:14.380
Now, now, Mr. Presley.

56:14.450 --> 56:19.183
You are looking much stronger,
but you shouldn't be out here too long.

56:19.255 --> 56:21.018
It's time for your nap.

56:21.090 --> 56:25.618
And it's also time for us to do
that little... you know.

56:25.695 --> 56:27.822
You fuck off,
you patronizing bitch!

56:29.565 --> 56:33.558
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube
my own crankshaft from now on.

56:35.938 --> 56:37.428
You treat me like a baby again,

56:37.506 --> 56:40.168
I'll wrap this goddamn walker
right around your head!

57:14.143 --> 57:16.077
How in the hell
did that mummy do that?

57:45.908 --> 57:49.241
Well... what the hell.

58:35.925 --> 58:37.859
Where did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?

58:39.495 --> 58:40.985
Where did he come from?

58:42.932 --> 58:44.661
How the hell did he get here?

58:48.604 --> 58:49.935
Wait a minute.

59:10.392 --> 59:12.883
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.

59:46.929 --> 59:48.089
Come on, mama.

01:00:20.462 --> 01:00:21.622
It's a cancer.

01:00:22.498 --> 01:00:25.934
They're keepin' it from me 'cause I'm old,
and to them, it don't matter.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:28.663
They think age will kill me first,
and they're probably right.

01:00:28.737 --> 01:00:29.897
Well, suck them!

01:00:30.906 --> 01:00:32.965
I know what it is,
and if it isn't...

01:00:33.042 --> 01:00:34.373
it might as well be.

01:01:32.334 --> 01:01:38.330
Station KROP is proud to present
the Elvis Presley movie marathon.

01:01:42.244 --> 01:01:46.738
It's 24 hours of Elvis
in the roles he made famous.

01:01:46.815 --> 01:01:51.081
Watch that two-fisted Hound Dog
out-strum, outrace,

01:01:51.153 --> 01:01:54.486
out-fight, and outwit the bad guys.

01:01:55.724 --> 01:02:00.991
And at the same time,
watch the King slay the girls.

01:02:04.366 --> 01:02:05.765
Shitty pictures, man.

01:02:06.835 --> 01:02:08.166
Every single one.

01:02:11.206 --> 01:02:14.698
Here I was complainin' about
loss of pride and how life had treated me,

01:02:14.777 --> 01:02:18.213
and now I realized...
I never had any pride.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.612
And much of how life
had treated me had been good.

01:02:20.683 --> 01:02:23.015
The bulk of the bad
was my own damn fault.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.753
Should've fired Colonel Parker
by the time I got in the pictures.

01:02:27.823 --> 01:02:29.552
Old fart had been a shark and a fool,

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:31.957
and I was an even bigger fool
for following him.

01:02:33.329 --> 01:02:35.320
If only I'd treated Priscilla right.

01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:38.926
If I could've told
my daughter I loved her.

01:02:40.402 --> 01:02:43.235
Always the questions.
Never the answers.

01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:46.797
Always the hopes...
never the fulfillments.

01:02:53.749 --> 01:02:57.480
I had the woman who calls herself
my niece come get me.

01:02:57.553 --> 01:03:00.716
She took me downtown this morning
to the newspaper morgue.

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:03.257
She's been helping me
to do some research.

01:03:04.193 --> 01:03:07.026
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.

01:03:07.096 --> 01:03:08.757
You know somethin' about him?

01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:10.890
I know plenty.

01:03:13.302 --> 01:03:16.703
Now, one of the lesser mummies,

01:03:16.772 --> 01:03:19.366
on loan from the Egyptian government,

01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:22.501
was being circulated
all over the United States.

01:03:22.578 --> 01:03:24.136
You know, museums,
stuff like that.

01:03:24.213 --> 01:03:26.238
What do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?

01:03:26.315 --> 01:03:28.112
No, more like King Tut's brother.

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:32.552
His mummy was flown or carried
by the train from state to state.

01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:35.215
When it got to Texas,
it was stolen.

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:36.279
Stolen?

01:03:36.358 --> 01:03:41.125
Evidence points to it being stolen at night
by a couple of guys in a silver bus.

01:03:41.196 --> 01:03:43.926
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!

01:03:43.999 --> 01:03:46.229
Anyway, the thieves
broke into the museum,

01:03:46.301 --> 01:03:49.236
stole it in hopes of a ransom,

01:03:49.304 --> 01:03:54.173
when in comes the worst storm
in East Texas history.

01:03:55.144 --> 01:03:56.236
Let me guess.

01:03:57.212 --> 01:03:59.203
The bus was washed away, see?

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:02.444
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.

01:04:02.518 --> 01:04:05.351
The mummy was imprisoned
by the debris.

01:04:06.255 --> 01:04:08.314
Look here...
how'd it come back to life?

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:10.790
And how did I end up
inside its memories?

01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:13.692
Speculation broadens here,
but from what I've read,

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:16.595
some mummies get buried
without their names...

01:04:16.665 --> 01:04:18.963
a curse put on their sarcophagus.

01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:23.329
Hey, now, maybe our boy's
one of them.

01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:27.569
I mean, when he's in the coffin,
he's just a dried-up old corpse,

01:04:27.643 --> 01:04:30.874
but when the bus got washed away,
maybe it overturned or broke open,

01:04:30.946 --> 01:04:32.937
and now he's free of coffin and curse.

01:04:33.015 --> 01:04:37.384
He's free from imprisonment,
but he still needs souls.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.351
Now he's free to have them.

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:43.619
He can just keep on feedin'
unless he's finally destroyed.

01:04:46.462 --> 01:04:47.952
So, what do we do, Jack?

01:04:49.298 --> 01:04:52.096
Changing rest homes
might be a good idea.

01:04:52.167 --> 01:04:53.794
I can't think of much else.

01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:55.860
But I will say this...

01:04:55.938 --> 01:04:59.601
Our mummy is
a nighttime kind of guy.

01:04:59.675 --> 01:05:02.872
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:05.311
I'll set my alarm
for just before dark,

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:08.008
then I can get myself
a couple of cups of coffee.

01:05:08.684 --> 01:05:09.946
Damn straight.

01:05:10.018 --> 01:05:13.749
If he comes in here tonight, I don't
want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.

01:05:13.822 --> 01:05:16.188
Yes. Consider it.

01:05:17.192 --> 01:05:21.925
He's got the proverbial
bird's nest on the ground here.

01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:43.584
What do I really have
left in life but this place?

01:05:48.157 --> 01:05:49.886
It ain't much of a home...

01:05:51.059 --> 01:05:52.617
but it's all I got.

01:05:57.966 --> 01:05:59.365
Well, goddamnit.

01:06:00.702 --> 01:06:05.765
I'll be damned if I let some foreign,
graffiti-writin', soul-suckin',

01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:09.174
son of a bitch in an oversized
cowboy hat and boots

01:06:09.244 --> 01:06:13.078
take my friends' souls and shit 'em
down the visitors toilet!

01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:22.021
In the movies,
I always played heroic types.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:23.523
But when the stage lights went out,

01:06:23.592 --> 01:06:27.255
it was time for drugs and stupidity
and the coveting of women.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.793
Now it's time.

01:06:29.865 --> 01:06:33.596
Time to be a little of what I
had always fantasized bein'...

01:06:33.669 --> 01:06:35.000
a hero.

01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:48.474
Hello?

01:06:49.218 --> 01:06:51.186
Mr. Kennedy?

01:06:51.253 --> 01:06:53.517
Ask not what your rest home
can do for you.

01:06:54.556 --> 01:06:56.922
Ask what you can do
for your rest home.

01:06:56.992 --> 01:07:00.655
Hey, you're copying my best lines.

01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:02.993
Then let me paraphrase
one of my own.

01:07:03.932 --> 01:07:05.923
Let's take care of business.

01:07:06.468 --> 01:07:09.335
Just what are you
getting at, Elvis?

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:11.599
I think you know
what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.

01:07:13.141 --> 01:07:14.631
We're gonna kill us a mummy.

01:07:27.556 --> 01:07:29.956
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.

01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.721
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.

01:07:33.795 --> 01:07:35.285
Look here.

01:07:35.364 --> 01:07:37.798
Found this in the storage room.

01:07:38.567 --> 01:07:39.898
I thought they kept it locked.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:42.766
They do. I stole a hairpin
and picked the lock, baby.

01:07:42.838 --> 01:07:44.135
Great.

01:07:44.206 --> 01:07:45.298
Matches.

01:07:46.074 --> 01:07:48.736
Check. Even scrounged up
a cigarette lighter.

01:07:49.845 --> 01:07:52.313
Good. Uniform.

01:07:57.085 --> 01:07:58.916
Big check on that, baby.

01:08:00.355 --> 01:08:05.520
Well, I got a nice pair of shoes
to go with this.

01:08:05.594 --> 01:08:06.652
Check.

01:08:08.697 --> 01:08:09.857
Scissors.

01:08:09.931 --> 01:08:11.159
Check.

01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:13.425
All right.

01:08:13.502 --> 01:08:16.868
Now, I got my chair
oiled and ready to roll.

01:08:17.471 --> 01:08:19.497
That's good, man.
We could use some wheels.

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:23.408
And I picked some words of power
from my book of magic.

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:25.207
I don't know
if they'll stop a mummy,

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.612
but they're supposed
to ward off evil.

01:08:28.283 --> 01:08:31.184
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:33.243
Well, we'll use what we got, baby.

01:08:34.122 --> 01:08:36.590
All right, 2:45 a.m.,
we hook up right back here.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:40.924
No, at the rate we travel,
maybe we ought to start at 2:30.

01:08:43.732 --> 01:08:44.790
Say, Jack?

01:08:46.902 --> 01:08:48.563
Do we know
what the hell we're doin', man?

01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:54.607
No. But they say
that fire cleanses evil.

01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:58.270
Let's just hope that they...
whoever they are... is right.

01:08:58.346 --> 01:08:59.904
Check on that, too.

01:08:59.981 --> 01:09:01.538
All right, synchronize watches.

01:09:01.616 --> 01:09:04.846
And... mark.

01:09:05.821 --> 01:09:10.656
Now, the twwo key words for tonight
are "caution" and "flammable."

01:09:10.725 --> 01:09:14.218
And also...
"watch your ass."

01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:25.031
What's that you got
hanging around your neck?

01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:28.064
That's my medicine bag.

01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:30.070
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.

01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:33.174
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.

01:10:34.309 --> 01:10:37.369
See here?
Mucho mojo.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.480
That's my daughter.

01:10:49.758 --> 01:10:51.157
I know.

01:10:53.829 --> 01:10:57.390
We weren't there for our kids
when they needed us, were we?

01:11:00.635 --> 01:11:02.626
Man, if I could just talk to her again...

01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:05.065
tell her I love her...

01:11:06.508 --> 01:11:08.567
try and make things right somehow.

01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:11.802
No time for regrets, Elvis.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.077
We were the best fathers we could be
under the circumstances.

01:11:17.319 --> 01:11:19.480
Yeah, I guess,
no time for regrets.

01:11:20.822 --> 01:11:22.483
We got business to take care of.

01:11:22.557 --> 01:11:25.253
Look here.
Top it off with this.

01:11:25.327 --> 01:11:27.659
I stole it from the gardener
when he wasn't lookin'.

01:11:32.601 --> 01:11:35.365
It's gonna be
one hell of a barbeque.

01:11:45.247 --> 01:11:46.646
Let's do it, amigo.

01:11:51.419 --> 01:11:52.477
Hey, Jack?

01:11:56.525 --> 01:11:58.083
I just got one last question.

01:12:00.362 --> 01:12:01.420
Marilyn.

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:06.931
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?

01:12:07.836 --> 01:12:09.827
What was she like in the sack?

01:12:10.805 --> 01:12:13.968
That is classified information.
Top secret!

01:12:15.544 --> 01:12:17.205
But betwween you and me...

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.440
Wow!

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.811
You old dog.
Watch your back, Jack.

01:12:31.526 --> 01:12:32.686
Gotta hump it.

01:13:23.979 --> 01:13:27.847
Shit... when Bubba Ho-Tep
comes out of that creek bed,

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.975
he's gonna come out
hungry and pissed.

01:13:30.051 --> 01:13:32.713
When I try and stop him, he's gonna
jam this paint can up my ass

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:35.119
and jam me and that wheelchair
up Jack's ass.

01:14:19.234 --> 01:14:20.792
Shit.

01:14:28.677 --> 01:14:29.871
Hey, Jack.

01:15:44.619 --> 01:15:46.450
Don't make me use
my stuff on you, baby.

01:16:30.031 --> 01:16:32.591
Damn!
Where did he go to?

01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:37.167
Hey! You stay put!

01:16:37.872 --> 01:16:39.203
I'll flush him out!

01:16:41.943 --> 01:16:43.535
You be careful, man.

01:16:52.086 --> 01:16:53.075
No, Jack!

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.378
Oh, man.

01:18:03.157 --> 01:18:06.820
Come and get it,
you undead sack of shit.

01:18:32.353 --> 01:18:33.513
Sorry, man.

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:03.610
Mr. Kennedy?

01:19:10.124 --> 01:19:14.561
The President is soon dead.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:24.800
So, now...
it's up to you, Elvis.

01:19:24.872 --> 01:19:27.306
You got to get him.

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:31.607
You... got to...

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.510
take care of business.

01:19:50.431 --> 01:19:51.591
That's right, man.

01:19:53.401 --> 01:19:54.891
T.C. B...

01:19:57.171 --> 01:19:58.502
It's just you and me.

01:20:17.492 --> 01:20:18.652
Mr. President.

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.981
"You nasty thing
from beyond the dead...

01:20:44.152 --> 01:20:49.317
"No matter what you think or do,
good things will never come to you.

01:20:52.627 --> 01:20:55.824
"And if evil
is your black design,

01:20:55.897 --> 01:21:00.561
"you can bet the goodness
of the Light Ones...

01:21:00.635 --> 01:21:03.763
will kick your bad behind"?

01:21:04.806 --> 01:21:06.467
For chrissake...

01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:07.701
That's it?

01:21:09.777 --> 01:21:12.678
That's the chant against evil
from the Book Of Souls?

01:21:12.747 --> 01:21:14.009
Yeah, right, boss.

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:16.573
And what kind of decoder ring
comes with that, man?

01:21:16.651 --> 01:21:18.949
Shit, it doesn't even rhyme well!

01:21:46.714 --> 01:21:48.113
This is dog shit.

01:21:52.987 --> 01:21:55.717
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.

01:21:57.925 --> 01:22:00.086
Come on, baby.
Here we go.

01:23:18.439 --> 01:23:19.838
I was goin' out.

01:23:20.608 --> 01:23:23.543
And if I did, not only would I be
one dead son of a bitch,

01:23:23.611 --> 01:23:24.771
but so would my soul.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.611
I'd be just so much crap.

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:32.215
No afterlife, no reincarnation,
no angels with harps.

01:23:32.954 --> 01:23:35.514
Whatever lay beyond
would not be known to me.

01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:38.920
It would all end right here
for Elvis Aaron Presley.

01:23:39.594 --> 01:23:41.653
Nothin' left but a quick flush.

01:23:45.866 --> 01:23:47.356
T.C.B., baby.

01:23:56.644 --> 01:23:59.772
Your soul-suckin' days
are over, amigo.

01:24:57.104 --> 01:25:00.505
I felt somethin' inside
gratin' against somethin' soft.

01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:04.477
I felt like a water balloon
with a hole poked in it.

01:25:07.281 --> 01:25:09.442
I was goin' down for the last count.

01:25:10.551 --> 01:25:11.711
And I knew it.

01:25:14.155 --> 01:25:15.986
But I still have my soul.

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:19.558
It's still mine.

01:25:21.095 --> 01:25:22.494
All mine.

01:25:27.034 --> 01:25:30.299
And the folks up there
at Shady Rest...

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.830
they have theirs, too.

01:25:35.476 --> 01:25:36.966
And they're gonna keep 'em.

01:25:38.846 --> 01:25:40.336
Every single one.

01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.270
Thank you.

01:26:13.047 --> 01:26:14.878
Thank you very much.
