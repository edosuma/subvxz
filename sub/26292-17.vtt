WEBVTT

00:02.013 --> 00:03.480
I gotta get this hospital ready for

00:03.515 --> 00:05.049
the worst storm that we've seen in

00:05.083 --> 00:06.584
I don't know how many years.

00:06.618 --> 00:09.220
If you pull me off, won't I die?

00:09.254 --> 00:11.488
If we stay here, you definitely will.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.165
Get me a gurney!

00:16.027 --> 00:16.994
If people can't get to this hospital,

00:17.028 --> 00:19.330
then we need to bring
this hospital to them.

00:19.364 --> 00:20.497
Max, as your doctor,

00:20.532 --> 00:22.633
I cannot let you traipse through a storm.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.335
And I will take care of myself

00:24.369 --> 00:26.403
because I love my doctor.

00:26.438 --> 00:27.592
Honey, I'm sorry,

00:27.626 --> 00:30.040
but it's never gonna work out
between you and Max.

00:30.075 --> 00:31.175
We need to talk.

00:31.209 --> 00:33.853
This thing between us...

00:41.119 --> 00:42.353
Max.

00:42.387 --> 00:44.221
Uh, we lost power.

00:44.256 --> 00:45.518
Shouldn't the generator be coming on?

00:45.552 --> 00:46.691
Any second.

00:46.725 --> 00:48.359
What's happening?

00:48.393 --> 00:51.595
Um, sorry folks.
It appears we lost power,

00:51.630 --> 00:53.820
but the generator should
be kicking in shortly.

00:53.854 --> 00:54.965
Is everyone all right?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.301
My baby's cold. C4an I get a blanket?

00:57.335 --> 00:58.235
Newborn?

00:58.270 --> 00:59.970
My husband couldn't get here
for her birth,

01:00.005 --> 01:01.472
and we've been discharged.

01:01.506 --> 01:03.474
The insurance company
wouldn't let us stay.

01:03.508 --> 01:04.908
It's okay. Here, just take my coat,

01:04.943 --> 01:07.945
and I'll get you a blanket
as soon as possible.

01:07.979 --> 01:11.048
- Is the heat coming back on?
- Yeah, shortly.

01:11.082 --> 01:13.286
Come on in, guys.
Just head right over here.

01:13.321 --> 01:14.885
We're gonna fix this.

01:14.919 --> 01:16.954
- Max.
- Yeah?

01:16.988 --> 01:18.555
The generator should have
kicked in by now.

01:18.590 --> 01:20.257
The circulatory machines,
the ventilators...

01:20.292 --> 01:22.126
Okay, just do a quick status run,

01:22.160 --> 01:23.560
check all the wards,
and I'll meet you in the ED.

01:23.595 --> 01:25.562
- No... should someone else...
- I'm fine.

01:30.602 --> 01:32.910
You wanted to tell me something.

01:34.005 --> 01:35.606
It can wait.

01:54.559 --> 01:56.260
- Henry.
- Dr. Goodwin.

01:56.294 --> 01:57.996
- How many on maintenance tonight?
- You're looking at him.

01:58.031 --> 01:59.431
Why isn't the generator coming on?

01:59.465 --> 02:00.978
I'm on my way to find out,
but it looks like

02:01.013 --> 02:03.500
the entire lower Manhattan grid is down.

02:03.535 --> 02:05.169
Every minute we're without power...

02:05.203 --> 02:07.736
- No, I get it.
- Patients will die.

02:10.140 --> 02:12.676
- Status?
- Improvising.

02:12.711 --> 02:14.311
Call it out, April.

02:14.346 --> 02:18.182
Mr. Ayers, blood pressure: 130/75.

02:18.216 --> 02:19.983
Pupils sluggish to react.

02:22.153 --> 02:23.454
We have someone on each of
the ventilator patients

02:23.488 --> 02:25.656
working an AMBU bag, taking pulses,

02:25.690 --> 02:27.282
visually monitoring stats and meds...

02:27.316 --> 02:28.459
Uh, what do you need?

02:28.493 --> 02:30.294
Besides power? More people.

02:30.328 --> 02:33.136
Since the storm, we've been
working with a skeleton crew.

02:34.232 --> 02:36.932
Thermal socks. We have to clean the feet.

02:38.169 --> 02:39.636
Keep his clothes on for the time being.

02:39.671 --> 02:41.305
No monitor. No suction.

02:41.339 --> 02:42.813
No cautery.

02:43.675 --> 02:45.476
But you still have me, right?

02:45.510 --> 02:47.478
Oh, yeah, holding firm.

02:47.512 --> 02:50.180
Hey, can we get a battery-powered fan?

02:50.215 --> 02:51.648
Reynolds.

02:51.683 --> 02:53.317
It's all good, Dr. Sharpe.

02:53.351 --> 02:57.588
I'm, uh, holding Hugh's heart
together with my fingers,

02:57.622 --> 03:00.657
but without power, we've got no
cardiopulmonary bypass...

03:00.692 --> 03:02.092
No way to titrate anesthesia.

03:02.127 --> 03:03.660
We can't operate without them.

03:03.695 --> 03:06.163
Max is working on the generator.

03:06.197 --> 03:07.331
All right.

03:07.365 --> 03:09.032
How are you doing, sir?

03:09.067 --> 03:11.883
Oh, you know... meh.

03:13.738 --> 03:16.607
Can I get another micro-insertion kit?

03:16.641 --> 03:18.275
On it.

03:20.812 --> 03:23.247
Hey. How you doing in there, Burl?

03:23.281 --> 03:26.183
Get me out of here.

03:26.217 --> 03:28.585
- It's tight!
- Yeah.

03:28.620 --> 03:31.021
Hey, guys, is there any way
to slide this out

03:31.055 --> 03:32.156
while the power's off?

03:32.190 --> 03:33.690
We're safer with him in the machine.

03:33.725 --> 03:35.025
- Danny, come on.
- He's here 'cause

03:35.059 --> 03:36.593
- he attacked a guard.
- No, he's not.

03:36.628 --> 03:38.128
He's here because a guard
bashed his head in.

03:38.163 --> 03:39.196
- In self-defense.
- Oh, give me a...

03:39.230 --> 03:42.433
The guard is my friend.
Your patient went off.

03:45.403 --> 03:47.304
Hey, hey, Burl... Burl, listen.

03:47.338 --> 03:49.273
Take a few deep breaths for me,
okay, buddy?

03:49.307 --> 03:51.442
- Deep breaths?
- We're all in this together.

03:51.476 --> 03:52.819
All right? Burl?

03:52.853 --> 03:54.578
- Iggy.
- Yeah.

03:54.612 --> 03:56.547
It's midnight. Why wasn't
this scheduled for earlier?

03:56.581 --> 03:58.449
We only bring the prisoners
at night, ma'am,

03:58.483 --> 03:59.716
for everyone's safety.

03:59.751 --> 04:01.552
Can you handle this?

04:01.586 --> 04:05.255
Sure, we're all in this together.

04:05.687 --> 04:06.980
Yeah.

04:10.628 --> 04:12.396
Okay, Burl.

04:12.430 --> 04:14.398
Get me out!

04:40.278 --> 04:41.291
Oh, um,

04:41.326 --> 04:43.827
- where's that sound coming from?
- Elevator?

04:43.862 --> 04:46.686
Can you tell everyone to get to ED?
I'll be there in a minute.

05:00.645 --> 05:03.714
- Hello?
- Helen?

05:03.748 --> 05:05.622
Vijay?

05:06.317 --> 05:08.886
Yes, I'm here with Dr. Hartman.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.621
You know my name's Clint, right?

05:10.655 --> 05:14.625
- Are you okay?
- Yes, we are fine.

05:14.659 --> 05:17.861
You don't look fine.
Are you claustrophobic?

05:17.896 --> 05:20.364
Hardly. It's been a very long day,

05:20.398 --> 05:24.668
and I'm stuck in this
very small box with you.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.471
Helen, why hasn't
the generator kicked in?

05:27.505 --> 05:30.730
- We're working on it.
- Keep working on it.

05:34.679 --> 05:36.904
What? Talk to me, Henry.

05:36.938 --> 05:38.315
I mean, this thing took a big hit

05:38.349 --> 05:39.816
during Hurricane Sandy.

05:39.851 --> 05:41.818
A lot these parts, they should
have been traded out.

05:41.853 --> 05:43.687
- And they weren't?
- It doesn't look like it.

05:43.721 --> 05:46.256
I mean, this fuel oil pump is failed,

05:46.291 --> 05:48.525
this main pipe that's still cracked...

05:48.560 --> 05:49.560
So?

05:49.594 --> 05:52.729
So, I could really use
some more light down here.

05:53.731 --> 05:55.332
Wait. Wait.

05:55.366 --> 05:57.174
I just remembered something.

05:58.303 --> 05:59.836
I hope it's still here.

06:04.375 --> 06:07.344
This... this could buy us some time.

06:07.378 --> 06:09.446
- What is it?
- Emergency battery.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.847
They got it after Sandy.

06:10.882 --> 06:12.716
Is it enough to power the hospital?

06:12.750 --> 06:15.686
No way, but it could
cover a floor for an hour.

06:19.724 --> 06:21.525
Okay, we got a battery. That'll buy us

06:21.559 --> 06:23.627
a little breathing room
while Henry keeps working.

06:23.661 --> 06:25.729
Reynolds is literally
holding a man's heart

06:25.763 --> 06:27.364
- together with his fingers.
- Yeah, I understand.

06:27.398 --> 06:28.799
And we got a NICU full of babies

06:28.833 --> 06:30.033
getting colder by the minute.

06:30.068 --> 06:33.570
I can buy us a little juice
for one floor for one hour.

06:33.605 --> 06:35.906
Okay, so ICU, ventilators, IV pumps?

06:35.940 --> 06:37.541
- Yes.
- Yes?

06:37.575 --> 06:38.709
What do you mean "yes"?

06:38.743 --> 06:40.310
We need to pick one. We need to triage.

06:40.345 --> 06:42.446
- Nope.
- Shouldn't we be evacuating?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.981
- No.
- To where? How?

06:44.015 --> 06:45.916
In this storm, we can't even
get across the street.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.384
Yeah, it's true. She's right.

06:47.418 --> 06:49.920
We're one of the only hospitals
with the, um...

06:49.954 --> 06:52.789
I was gonna say "with
the lights still on," but...

06:52.824 --> 06:55.325
We could move everybody
to the same floor.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.927
- Yes.
- That's crazy.

06:56.961 --> 06:58.729
Well, why? We're not at capacity.

06:58.763 --> 07:00.831
- Uh...
- Look, it's Helen's idea.

07:00.865 --> 07:01.999
But that's only because
you won't let me triage.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.935
No triage. Look, Henry is
having difficulty seeing.

07:04.969 --> 07:06.603
Would you grab a flashlight
and meet us down there?

07:06.638 --> 07:08.305
Yeah, yes.

07:08.339 --> 07:09.339
- Max.
- Huh?

07:09.374 --> 07:10.956
- We cannot...
- We will.

07:19.050 --> 07:20.584
Yo, hand me those soft-grip pliers.

07:20.618 --> 07:22.419
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

07:22.453 --> 07:24.177
Going with the soft-grip. Here you go.

07:25.456 --> 07:27.424
So, are you gonna check
those rotors or what?

07:27.458 --> 07:29.860
- Yeah, I'm doing it now.
- Yeah, cool.

07:30.392 --> 07:31.595
Boom.

07:31.629 --> 07:33.764
- I'm very impressed.
- Yeah, are you?

07:33.798 --> 07:35.932
Well, that's what growing up
on a farm does for a man.

07:35.967 --> 07:36.967
Teaches him to say "boom" a lot?

07:37.001 --> 07:38.035
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

07:38.069 --> 07:39.369
These rotors seem fine,

07:39.404 --> 07:40.804
but the connections are damaged.

07:40.838 --> 07:42.039
- Tweak the rotors.
- If I could just

07:42.073 --> 07:43.774
get them to turn a little bit,
there might be enough power

07:43.808 --> 07:45.008
left inside the system f...

07:45.043 --> 07:46.043
Whoa!

07:46.077 --> 07:49.012
Henry!

07:49.047 --> 07:50.981
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:52.976 --> 07:54.735
One, two, three...

07:54.760 --> 07:56.294
Nothing.

07:56.328 --> 07:58.029
Come on, Henry. Stay with me.

07:58.063 --> 08:00.398
Stay with me, come on. Three... four...

08:00.432 --> 08:01.799
- Come on, Henry.
- Five, six...

08:01.834 --> 08:03.901
Seven, either, nine, ten.

08:03.936 --> 08:05.536
No, nothing. Let me get an AED...

08:05.571 --> 08:06.571
No, no, no. There's no time.

08:06.605 --> 08:07.939
Here we go.

08:09.341 --> 08:10.908
- All right.
- Yeah?

08:10.943 --> 08:13.945
Oh, come on, Henry. Going again.

08:15.314 --> 08:16.414
Yeah?

08:16.448 --> 08:17.749
Nothing. No, Max, that's enough.

08:17.783 --> 08:19.250
No, one more try, one more try.

08:19.284 --> 08:20.618
Come on, Henry.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.875
NICU and ICU are priority zones.

08:24.909 --> 08:26.610
But they're different floors.

08:26.644 --> 08:28.712
We could move the babies to the ICU.

08:28.746 --> 08:30.247
And everyone else?

08:30.281 --> 08:33.183
Yeah, move everyone
to the ICU, all the patients.

08:33.217 --> 08:34.351
Keep the NICU separated,

08:34.385 --> 08:35.852
and bring the people up from the lobby.

08:35.886 --> 08:37.354
We can turn off all nonessentials,

08:37.388 --> 08:39.722
convert IV drips
to subcutaneous injections.

08:39.756 --> 08:41.058
What about Reynolds' man in the OR?

08:41.092 --> 08:42.638
- I can help with that.
- Go ahead.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.039
Wha... what happened?

08:46.064 --> 08:48.298
He was electrocuted, v-fib arrest

08:48.333 --> 08:50.634
with ROSC after pericardial thump.

08:50.668 --> 08:52.202
He should be okay, but we need to monitor

08:52.236 --> 08:54.071
his rhythm and treat
the burns on his hands.

08:54.105 --> 08:57.207
All right, okay. So, no generator?

08:57.241 --> 08:58.742
Not unless you can fix it.

08:58.776 --> 09:02.312
Guys, I may know someone who can.

09:02.347 --> 09:03.313
Who?

09:03.348 --> 09:04.948
Well, he's, um...

09:04.982 --> 09:07.117
He's currently stuck in an MRI machine.

09:07.151 --> 09:08.919
- The Rikers patient?
- Yes, the Rikers patient.

09:08.953 --> 09:11.588
But he used to work for DWP,
he's smart...

09:11.622 --> 09:13.156
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

09:13.191 --> 09:15.070
Full disclosure, though,

09:15.105 --> 09:17.828
he sort of murdered his coworker.

09:17.862 --> 09:18.929
- Oh, my God.
- Right.

09:18.963 --> 09:21.098
But it wasn't premeditated.
He's not a psychopath.

09:21.132 --> 09:22.766
He just has behavioral issues.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.768
A rather big one, don't you think?

09:25.970 --> 09:27.270
Yeah.

09:27.675 --> 09:29.005
I'll take full responsibility.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.262
Plus, there's a guard there, so...

09:31.776 --> 09:33.139
it's our best shot.

09:38.850 --> 09:40.350
Keep this tray in place.

09:40.385 --> 09:43.186
His blood pressure's dropped
down to 90/64.

09:43.221 --> 09:45.822
- Hang in there, Hugh.
- Is that a fence joke?

09:45.857 --> 09:47.231
Just keep talking.

09:47.265 --> 09:48.658
Make a list of all the things
you're gonna do

09:48.693 --> 09:50.293
with your husband when you get home.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.663
Scrub the baseboards, fold the towels...

09:53.698 --> 09:57.134
though, Eric always says
three folds is overkill.

09:57.168 --> 09:59.136
Eric can have an opinion on three folds

09:59.170 --> 10:00.637
when he starts doing laundry.

10:00.671 --> 10:01.935
Good point.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.974
You have to help me remember
to tell him all this

10:04.008 --> 10:05.308
if I make it.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.177
You're gonna make it.

10:07.211 --> 10:09.379
BP's dropped to 82/40.

10:09.414 --> 10:11.281
We need to do something now.

10:12.750 --> 10:13.901
Hypothermic coma.

10:13.936 --> 10:15.315
Lower his body temp to near freezing

10:15.350 --> 10:16.453
and slow his metabolism.

10:16.487 --> 10:18.221
Wasn't I freezing outside?

10:18.256 --> 10:19.890
No, no, no, this will be controlled.

10:19.924 --> 10:21.590
I'm afraid it's our only option.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.827
Respectfully disagree.

10:23.861 --> 10:25.328
You bring me some power?

10:25.363 --> 10:27.063
No, but we can do his surgery right now.

10:27.098 --> 10:28.327
With what?

10:28.361 --> 10:30.200
We have all the equipment we need here.

10:30.234 --> 10:32.836
I worked in far worse
conditions in Afghanistan.

10:32.870 --> 10:35.839
Dr. Candelario,
this is my patient, my OR.

10:35.873 --> 10:38.681
Your OR has decent lighting
and electricity.

10:38.716 --> 10:40.076
We can save this man,

10:40.111 --> 10:42.312
but I'm gonna need you to let go.

10:42.346 --> 10:43.747
Literally.

10:43.781 --> 10:45.882
Go ahead with the IV, it'll help BP...

10:46.884 --> 10:48.718
We'll have battery power at any moment.

10:48.753 --> 10:50.153
It's all right.
We're all gonna get there.

10:50.188 --> 10:51.488
Will you just take your time, please?

10:51.522 --> 10:53.356
And don't panic!

10:56.928 --> 10:59.396
Will you hurry up?

10:59.430 --> 11:00.831
Take your time.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.201
Ugh, I just wanna get out of here.

11:04.235 --> 11:06.503
What's going on here?

11:06.537 --> 11:09.039
Do you know what's going on here?

11:11.242 --> 11:13.009
Calm down, okay?

11:13.044 --> 11:14.574
Everyone...

11:15.146 --> 11:17.827
Hey! Hey!

11:18.620 --> 11:22.304
We have light. Heat will follow.

11:22.339 --> 11:25.055
I know that the circumstances
are less than ideal, but we...

11:26.123 --> 11:28.358
Hey, there's something wrong
with this woman.

11:30.261 --> 11:31.962
Help that lady. Help that lady.

11:31.996 --> 11:34.130
It's a baby.

11:34.165 --> 11:35.465
Agnes.

11:36.012 --> 11:37.597
I'll hold her.

11:38.348 --> 11:39.870
She was complaining of
a headache earlier.

11:39.904 --> 11:41.166
Want me to get Dr. Kapoor?

11:41.200 --> 11:44.307
He's stuck in an elevator...
With Hartman.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.111
You're gonna have to take care of her.

11:53.251 --> 11:56.152
It's all right, Dr. Sharpe. I've got her.

12:03.494 --> 12:06.329
You can write .6 mg per minute.

12:06.364 --> 12:08.798
Confirming he said he was 162 pounds?

12:08.833 --> 12:10.066
Confirmed.

12:10.101 --> 12:11.501
I've never managed anesthesia levels

12:11.536 --> 12:12.936
without a monitor before.

12:12.970 --> 12:15.071
Hold my beer.

12:15.261 --> 12:16.261
That's okay.

12:16.295 --> 12:17.595
Though neither of you
learned these techniques

12:17.630 --> 12:19.130
in medical school, I can assure you

12:19.165 --> 12:20.598
they've been practiced for ages.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.001
That said, you may wanna stand back.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.750
Hello, Agnes.

12:38.784 --> 12:41.519
Hi, Dr. Kapoor. Are you all right?

12:41.554 --> 12:44.622
I'm fine. Better now.

12:46.158 --> 12:48.993
- I'm here too.
- Yes, he's here too.

12:49.028 --> 12:49.994
I need your help.

12:50.029 --> 12:51.029
Mine?

12:51.063 --> 12:53.064
Both of you, I think.

12:55.501 --> 12:56.862
What's the matter with her?

12:56.896 --> 12:59.137
She gave birth yesterday,
complained of a headache,

12:59.171 --> 13:01.139
then collapsed when we moved
everyone up to the ICU.

13:01.173 --> 13:03.475
Have you assessed her reflexes?

13:03.509 --> 13:07.112
She has a motor deficit
of the left upper extremity

13:07.146 --> 13:09.514
and left lower extremity, sensory intact.

13:09.548 --> 13:11.316
It sounds like an amniotic stroke.

13:11.350 --> 13:12.406
What do I do?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.152
Nothing. There's nothing you can do,

13:14.186 --> 13:16.387
not until the power comes back on.

13:16.422 --> 13:17.989
Get a 60cc syringe,

13:18.023 --> 13:20.992
a 7 French catheter with
a metal tip, and a magnet.

13:21.026 --> 13:23.327
- A magnet?
- Yes. Hurry.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.063
Okay, you're kidding, right?

13:25.097 --> 13:27.031
The woman will die
if we don't try to help her.

13:27.066 --> 13:29.567
Yeah, but we don't have the tools.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.536
You don't have the tools.

13:36.709 --> 13:37.971
Where are your maintenance people?

13:38.006 --> 13:41.146
All but one were sent home,
and he's hurt.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.080
Huh.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.516
Hurt trying to do the job
you want me to do?

13:44.550 --> 13:45.933
Afraid so.

13:46.519 --> 13:49.154
- Is this your idea?
- Not remotely.

13:51.557 --> 13:53.224
I'm gonna need a set of plans.

13:53.259 --> 13:55.068
For the generator?

13:55.528 --> 13:56.962
For the hospital.

14:05.805 --> 14:09.607
Not exactly state of the art.

14:09.642 --> 14:12.443
- Yeah.
- What exactly do you need the plans for?

14:12.478 --> 14:13.542
He doesn't.

14:13.576 --> 14:17.006
Hey, nothing gets fixed in a vacuum.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.551
An old building...

14:21.320 --> 14:23.221
Could be a wiring issue.

14:25.224 --> 14:27.425
Your man get fried on the pump?

14:27.459 --> 14:29.519
Honestly, I'm not sure.

14:30.396 --> 14:32.855
If you want me to, I can fix it.

14:33.732 --> 14:37.860
I'm gonna need a set of plans, and um...

14:39.271 --> 14:41.139
And a reduced sentence.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.273
Burl...

14:42.308 --> 14:43.775
Pardon from the governor works too.

14:43.809 --> 14:45.410
Okay, we're done here. Let's go.

14:45.444 --> 14:47.312
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on. Well,
how much longer do you think

14:47.346 --> 14:48.678
the guards and the prisoners
are gonna play nice

14:48.712 --> 14:50.748
- if they're freezing to death?
- Look, Burl,

14:50.783 --> 14:53.384
I'm not in a position to negotiate terms.

14:53.419 --> 14:55.253
Well, then I guess people are gonna die.

14:55.287 --> 14:58.590
Hold on. No, but you
don't want that, Burl.

14:58.624 --> 15:00.491
None of us want to lose anyone.

15:00.526 --> 15:04.495
Now, this man, whom I know
to be a good man,

15:04.887 --> 15:06.389
he doesn't trust you.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.635
But that's a familiar scenario, isn't it?

15:10.669 --> 15:13.438
You could be a hero tonight, Burl.

15:13.472 --> 15:16.541
I'm trusting you
to come through for everyone.

15:18.344 --> 15:20.111
Has anyone ever said that to you before?

15:20.145 --> 15:23.197
Has anyone ever give you
that opportunity?

15:24.650 --> 15:27.518
Burl, you said
you wanted to change, right?

15:27.553 --> 15:29.454
This is it. This is where it starts.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.005
Okay.

15:39.798 --> 15:41.048
I'll help.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.302
But I need those plans...

15:45.337 --> 15:48.473
- And these off.
- No way.

15:48.507 --> 15:50.661
Can't work tied up.

15:56.382 --> 15:58.950
Okay, there's a set of plans
in my office closet.

15:58.984 --> 16:00.652
Okay.

16:02.488 --> 16:03.797
He's playing you, man.

16:03.831 --> 16:06.658
Maybe, but tonight's
not gonna end well for anyone

16:06.692 --> 16:09.794
if he can't get
this thing fixed, so Reyes,

16:10.154 --> 16:11.755
please remove his restraints.

16:40.835 --> 16:42.402
Right ventricle's exposed.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.836
Lung sounds bilateral.

16:43.871 --> 16:45.738
In a traditional surgery, this is where

16:45.773 --> 16:47.240
I'd stop the heart from beating.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.450
- But we can't do that.
- No, we can't.

16:50.144 --> 16:52.678
But you've been holding
the heart for a long time.

16:52.713 --> 16:54.747
Perhaps you've got
the rhythm down, right?

16:54.782 --> 16:56.449
You want me to time each suture

16:56.483 --> 16:57.750
to the relaxation phase.

16:57.785 --> 16:59.318
Exactly.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.792
Time to let go.

17:16.170 --> 17:17.811
Um...

17:18.571 --> 17:20.540
Can you slow him down a bit more, Alicia?

17:20.574 --> 17:22.775
- Give me time to sew?
- I'll try.

17:22.810 --> 17:25.278
Kat, I'm gonna need a 3.0 Prolene

17:25.311 --> 17:26.536
on a needle driver.

17:47.701 --> 17:49.702
You're doing great.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.340
It's not much different, actually.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.777
I mean, it is, but I never realized

17:57.811 --> 17:59.812
how much I relied on machines.

18:01.682 --> 18:03.649
Doing it old-school like this

18:03.984 --> 18:05.651
makes me think I might be

18:05.686 --> 18:07.737
a better surgeon than I thought.

18:10.224 --> 18:11.624
- Oh, no.
- Alicia?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.493
What...

18:13.527 --> 18:15.294
What are you...?

18:15.329 --> 18:16.529
Alicia...

18:16.563 --> 18:17.797
Alicia, get him back under!

18:19.900 --> 18:21.501
Uh, sir?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.669
Sir, we need to be able
to get through here.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.978
She's hungry. I tried giving the formula,

18:32.012 --> 18:33.646
but she wouldn't take it.

18:35.883 --> 18:37.984
She needs her mother.

18:38.018 --> 18:40.286
- His heart's racing!
- I'm trying.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.230
We need blood, O-neg.

18:52.533 --> 18:54.634
There isn't any. We exhausted
the supply earlier tonight.

18:54.668 --> 18:57.369
Then find some. We're not losing him.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.377
Sorry, can I have everyone's attention?

19:04.411 --> 19:08.247
We have a medical emergency
in one of our operating rooms,

19:08.282 --> 19:11.884
and we need, um, uh,
type O-negative blood.

19:11.919 --> 19:15.988
So, the process is quick
and relatively painless,

19:16.023 --> 19:18.691
and, uh... you can help save a life.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.861
So if anybody knows that
they are O-negative already,

19:21.895 --> 19:24.397
go ahead and, um, uh, raise your hand,

19:24.431 --> 19:25.981
and we'll, um...

19:28.635 --> 19:29.835
Uh...

19:35.475 --> 19:39.378
Sorry, guys, but I need your attention

19:39.413 --> 19:40.955
just for a minute.

19:41.782 --> 19:43.783
Would everybody look down?

19:43.817 --> 19:47.378
Just look directly below you.

19:47.921 --> 19:48.821
Um...

19:48.855 --> 19:51.624
If you had X-ray vision,
what you would see

19:51.658 --> 19:53.459
is our second-floor OR.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.261
You would see a man
on the table in the dark.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.262
His name is Hugh.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.464
Hugh is having
open-heart surgery right now,

19:58.498 --> 20:01.767
in a no-electricity setting,
and he is running out of blood.

20:02.336 --> 20:05.479
So however difficult
you're finding today,

20:06.230 --> 20:08.941
I promise you, Hugh's day
is going a lot worse.

20:08.976 --> 20:11.844
So, here, I will go first.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.316
We're in the middle of a night that

20:17.351 --> 20:19.368
we're gonna remember
for the rest of our lives.

20:21.989 --> 20:23.789
We're gonna tell the story of how,

20:24.658 --> 20:27.793
in the worst blizzard
New York's seen in a century,

20:27.828 --> 20:29.795
we were trapped in a hospital.

20:29.830 --> 20:33.065
And it can be a story about
how tired and hungry

20:33.100 --> 20:37.069
and cold and angry we were.

20:37.104 --> 20:39.805
It can be a story about how we couldn't

20:40.140 --> 20:41.674
stop fighting with each other

20:41.708 --> 20:44.076
or how Dr. Sharpe kept yelling at you.

20:44.111 --> 20:48.681
Or it can be a story of how,

20:48.715 --> 20:51.951
when every instinct told us
to be at our worst,

20:51.985 --> 20:54.520
we were at our best.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.363
And if we do that,

20:56.857 --> 20:59.325
then maybe Hugh gets to stick around

20:59.693 --> 21:01.894
and tell that story too.

21:06.533 --> 21:10.503
So... would anyone like a blood test?

21:13.540 --> 21:15.090
Yeah, I will.

21:15.509 --> 21:16.942
- Yes? Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.

21:16.977 --> 21:18.544
Yeah? Great. Thanks.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.513
You just see Casey right here,

21:20.547 --> 21:22.615
and, um, and he'll help you out.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.309
Thank you. Thank you.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.988
Nice work, except for the yelling part.

21:29.022 --> 21:31.357
You need to sit down.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.858
- Max, as your doctor...
- I'm fine.

21:32.893 --> 21:35.319
- You're not well.
- Thank God for adrenaline.

21:36.930 --> 21:38.698
Dr. Sharpe, the baby...

21:56.049 --> 21:57.817
The introducer's in place.

21:57.851 --> 22:00.720
Good. Now thread
the catheter into her arteries.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.991
Done, now what?

22:06.026 --> 22:08.094
Oh!

22:08.128 --> 22:10.312
Dr. Kapoor?

22:10.764 --> 22:11.831
What's wrong with you?

22:11.865 --> 22:15.025
Oh, God, my foot is cramping.

22:16.136 --> 22:19.071
I spent too long in the snow.

22:19.106 --> 22:21.874
I need you to apply acupressure

22:21.908 --> 22:24.610
to K-6 point, please.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.579
On your foot?

22:26.613 --> 22:29.915
Dr. Hartman,
as you often enjoy pointing out

22:29.950 --> 22:31.884
that I'm not a young man,

22:31.918 --> 22:35.187
I cannot contort myself to do this.

22:35.222 --> 22:36.722
So that's why you treat me like garbage?

22:36.757 --> 22:38.924
Because I made a couple
of jokes about your age?

22:38.959 --> 22:40.626
More than a couple.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.529
Okay, I got into neurosurgery
so I didn't have to touch

22:43.563 --> 22:45.765
my patients' bodies,
much less their feet.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.833
Dr. Kapoor?

22:48.835 --> 22:52.238
If you don't help me,
I cannot help Agnes.

22:52.272 --> 22:56.142
All you have to do is to apply
pressure between

22:56.176 --> 22:59.578
the second and third metatarsal,

22:59.613 --> 23:03.716
one third the way between
the MTP joint and calcaneus.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.551
Please.

23:07.821 --> 23:10.956
Oh, God. Yeah.

23:10.991 --> 23:12.258
Open the laces, please.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.093
Yeah, I have shoes.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.462
- Oh!
- Just calm down.

23:19.299 --> 23:22.201
Without the socks, please.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.539
There.

23:30.177 --> 23:31.685
Gently.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.815
Oh. Ah.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.783
- Put some pressure, no?
- Oh, my God.

23:37.818 --> 23:38.984
I'm ready with the magnet.

23:39.019 --> 23:42.955
Agnes, the baby needs to be fed.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.027
- Station her here.
- But she's unconscious.

23:48.061 --> 23:49.829
Well, I don't think we have a choice.

24:01.341 --> 24:05.044
- When was this place built?
- Uh, 1766.

24:05.078 --> 24:06.312
You know, there used to be

24:06.346 --> 24:08.147
an old swimming pool in the basement?

24:08.181 --> 24:11.617
Uh... no, I didn't. No, I did not.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.651
Neat.

24:12.686 --> 24:13.853
Ah!

24:13.887 --> 24:16.622
- Damn it!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

24:16.656 --> 24:17.890
Hold on. Burl?

24:17.924 --> 24:19.158
Burl, are you all right?

24:21.328 --> 24:22.611
What?

24:23.230 --> 24:26.907
- Uh, you screamed.
- Yeah. I got frustrated.

24:27.334 --> 24:28.404
Okay.

24:28.438 --> 24:31.537
Anyway, I think I know what to do.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.872
I'm gonna need welding equipment.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.206
Yeah, we can get that for you.

24:34.241 --> 24:35.908
It shouldn't take me
more than ten minutes.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.376
All right.

24:38.278 --> 24:41.463
Problem is, it's gonna
suck up a lot of your juice.

24:42.115 --> 24:43.682
You said you had a portion
of the hospital

24:43.717 --> 24:44.850
running on a battery?

24:44.885 --> 24:46.085
The ICU.

24:46.119 --> 24:48.020
I'm gonna need that power.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.265
If you can't fix it...

24:52.259 --> 24:54.360
Then we'd all be done.

24:54.394 --> 24:56.562
No more juice for anybody.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.075
It's your call.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.764
How can you put your faith in this man,

25:09.799 --> 25:10.865
I know that I did not see half
a violent man?

25:10.900 --> 25:13.436
Well, his violence
was triggered by abuse at work

25:13.470 --> 25:14.556
and years of beatings as a kid.

25:14.590 --> 25:16.671
The guard will be with him at all times.

25:16.705 --> 25:18.673
He gets the power he needs,
we get New Amsterdam

25:18.707 --> 25:19.827
back on its feet.

25:19.861 --> 25:22.210
- It's the only way.
- No, it is not the only way.

25:22.244 --> 25:23.711
The latest emergency bulletin said

25:23.746 --> 25:26.181
the storm should break around 5:00 a.m.

25:26.215 --> 25:28.239
With the wind down, we could
get a helicopter on the roof

25:28.273 --> 25:29.451
and a new generator.

25:29.485 --> 25:31.359
Yeah, but there's no guarantee
the storm's gonna break.

25:31.393 --> 25:32.454
As opposed to the iron certainty

25:32.488 --> 25:34.975
of us trusting a homicidal electrician?

25:35.289 --> 25:38.560
In a half an hour, the battery
will be dead regardless.

25:38.594 --> 25:39.561
We may not be able to keep

25:39.595 --> 25:42.197
our most critical patients
alive until 5:00 a.m.

25:42.231 --> 25:44.199
Right, so your prisoner uses up all

25:44.233 --> 25:45.366
of our existing power and fails,

25:45.401 --> 25:47.735
and that's a half an hour
less time that we have to try.

25:47.770 --> 25:49.370
Not to mention all the people
that we'd be putting

25:49.405 --> 25:50.454
back into the cold.

25:50.489 --> 25:52.012
Just think about the greater good, Max.

25:52.046 --> 25:53.441
Yeah, I am, Helen. Okay?

25:53.476 --> 25:56.311
I'm not signing off on any plan
that requires me to triage,

25:56.345 --> 25:57.645
to give up on anyone.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.581
Well, then you are risking
everyone's life.

25:59.615 --> 26:01.951
I'm trying to save everyone's life.

26:01.985 --> 26:04.129
That is not possible.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.823
Dr. Sharpe, please inform
everyone that in a few moments

26:08.858 --> 26:11.292
the power will go down for
approximately ten minutes.

26:11.327 --> 26:13.077
After which, God willing,

26:13.112 --> 26:15.307
New Amsterdam will be fully back online.

26:15.664 --> 26:17.117
Okay?

26:29.612 --> 26:31.579
What are you...?

26:31.614 --> 26:32.868
Kira...

26:37.553 --> 26:39.521
What happened?

26:39.555 --> 26:41.589
My arm.

26:41.624 --> 26:43.324
You've had a mild stroke.

26:45.294 --> 26:48.596
And my baby? How did she...?

26:48.631 --> 26:50.331
She's fine.

26:51.634 --> 26:53.968
Agnes, it's time to place the magnet

26:54.003 --> 26:57.805
on the right side of
the patient's temple.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.184
Okay.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.377
And surely your foot is better by now.

27:02.411 --> 27:04.779
Of course, but you seem to be
happy holding it.

27:06.048 --> 27:09.884
Okay, Agnes, now when you feel
the tug on the catheter,

27:09.919 --> 27:12.954
you will know when
it's in the right place.

27:21.564 --> 27:24.732
I feel it. It's working.

27:24.767 --> 27:27.869
Good. You have Hartman and
his youthful fingers to thank.

27:36.378 --> 27:38.913
Okay, this is all the welding gear

27:38.948 --> 27:40.014
that we could find.

27:40.049 --> 27:43.751
Yeah, we got this thing
and whatever this thing is.

27:43.786 --> 27:44.919
I thought you grew up on a farm.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.855
Yeah, I can make that work.

27:47.890 --> 27:49.691
How can we help?

27:49.725 --> 27:51.693
Run the cables up to the battery.

27:51.727 --> 27:54.529
Okay. Yeah, I'm on it.

27:54.563 --> 27:56.397
And then you should all
go out in the hall

27:56.432 --> 27:58.118
before I light this.

27:58.867 --> 28:01.903
So you don't, you know, blow up.

28:04.807 --> 28:07.075
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

28:07.109 --> 28:08.910
The minute you're done
with this little game,

28:08.944 --> 28:11.913
I'm dragging your ass off
to a cold, dark corner.

28:11.947 --> 28:13.982
- You understand me?
- Reyes.

28:35.971 --> 28:39.701
All right, everybody, here we go.

29:51.747 --> 29:53.014
Is he done?

29:53.048 --> 29:54.615
Yeah, I guess.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.617
Hey, Burl, you okay in there, buddy?

30:00.522 --> 30:02.033
Burl?

30:07.229 --> 30:09.791
Burl, hey, buddy. How you doing?

30:21.610 --> 30:23.638
- Damn it.
- I told you.

30:30.686 --> 30:32.920
Max. Max!

30:32.955 --> 30:35.189
Where you going?

30:46.981 --> 30:48.581
- Where's Henry?
- In the ICU.

30:48.615 --> 30:51.184
Where's his notebook? He had a notebook.

30:51.218 --> 30:53.119
He was making notes. We can wake him up,

30:53.153 --> 30:54.120
he can look at them with fresh eyes,

30:54.154 --> 30:56.422
and then we can come up with
a different plan,

30:56.457 --> 30:57.457
a better plan, and we can fix it.

30:57.491 --> 30:58.564
Okay?

30:58.599 --> 31:00.793
'Cause there's still time to fix...

31:00.828 --> 31:02.295
- Damn it!
- Max.

31:04.164 --> 31:05.598
Stop.

31:14.475 --> 31:16.476
It's nearly 2:00 a.m.

31:18.645 --> 31:23.149
Hopefully the storm breaks at five.

31:23.183 --> 31:25.051
And that gives us at least three hours

31:25.085 --> 31:27.186
to disburse extremely limited resources,

31:27.221 --> 31:29.055
but you and I need
to decide which patients

31:29.089 --> 31:31.357
are gonna get them and which ones aren't.

31:34.328 --> 31:37.864
That's not who we are.

31:37.898 --> 31:39.632
No, but it's where we are.

31:39.666 --> 31:41.633
- Helen...
- Max.

31:42.169 --> 31:45.505
We have no power, no blood,
it's freezing...

31:45.539 --> 31:47.889
That doesn't mean someone has to die.

31:48.942 --> 31:50.176
But someone will.

31:52.799 --> 31:55.134
That's just a fact now.

31:57.384 --> 31:59.986
Your job is no longer to save everyone.

32:00.020 --> 32:01.854
It's to try and minimize the damage.

32:01.889 --> 32:03.222
Do you understand that?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.774
I thought it would work.

32:12.065 --> 32:16.369
I just couldn't see a scenario
where it didn't.

32:19.714 --> 32:21.347
I know.

32:22.976 --> 32:25.010
But now we have to choose...

32:26.594 --> 32:28.080
who to let go.

32:33.654 --> 32:35.228
I can't...

32:39.712 --> 32:41.513
Choose.

32:45.986 --> 32:47.574
I won't.

32:52.573 --> 32:54.497
Then I will.

33:04.284 --> 33:05.585
The city's still out.

33:05.619 --> 33:08.287
That means the generator...

33:15.596 --> 33:17.896
We got power. Hook him up.

33:20.300 --> 33:22.400
Assess the ABCs.

33:23.303 --> 33:25.237
Continue monitoring manually until...

33:25.272 --> 33:28.007
Come on, man. You just
have to hang on a bit longer.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.610
Okay, the catheter's all the way in.

33:30.644 --> 33:32.244
End of the line.

33:32.279 --> 33:34.146
Good, Agnes.
You're doing a wonderful job.

33:34.181 --> 33:37.450
All you have to do now
is to attach the syringe and...

33:41.555 --> 33:43.255
Dr. Kapoor?

33:43.290 --> 33:44.323
Agnes?

33:48.061 --> 33:49.662
And what?

33:59.806 --> 34:01.007
I've got this.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.816
Mm-hmm.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.545
Where's the blood?

34:47.554 --> 34:51.556
Kira, try to move your left arm for me.

34:58.598 --> 35:01.534
Thank you.

35:01.568 --> 35:02.735
Thank you.

35:12.412 --> 35:13.579
Hey. Hey.

35:13.613 --> 35:14.714
How'd you get us the juice?

35:14.748 --> 35:16.306
I didn't.

35:17.150 --> 35:18.551
Okay.

35:22.589 --> 35:24.356
Hey.

35:26.393 --> 35:29.028
- Did you fix the...
- Welding wasn't gonna fix that.

35:29.062 --> 35:31.779
I couldn't tell you that or Reyes
would have dragged me off.

35:32.232 --> 35:34.100
I just figured if this place
had an old swimming pool,

35:34.134 --> 35:36.736
it might have a fuel pump
system I could switch out.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.470
It did.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.873
What do you want?

35:42.999 --> 35:45.376
Anything. I'll make it happen.

35:50.450 --> 35:52.091
I wanna get better.

36:43.637 --> 36:47.373
Oh, and the baseboards...

36:47.407 --> 36:50.900
Never another speck of dust.

36:51.545 --> 36:54.613
Did you tell him about
the towels? Three folds?

36:54.648 --> 36:57.516
- How do you know about that?
- You wanted to tell him.

36:58.752 --> 37:01.220
And I'm gonna fold all the towels

37:01.254 --> 37:04.290
just the way you don't like them.

37:05.892 --> 37:09.195
I was brilliant last night, wasn't I?

37:09.229 --> 37:11.797
Oh, yes, exceptional

37:11.832 --> 37:13.532
with all your years in the field.

37:16.369 --> 37:17.703
Thank you.

37:43.230 --> 37:45.731
You were bloody magnificent last night.

37:47.634 --> 37:49.869
I just said "bloody."

37:49.903 --> 37:53.421
I could think of a better
expression under the circumstances.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.608
It's a UK thing.

37:55.642 --> 37:58.510
- So I've heard.
- Mm-hmm.

37:58.545 --> 37:59.886
Really.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.916
There's no way I would have
gotten through it without you.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.067
We make a good team.

38:12.425 --> 38:16.569
That's what I wanted to
speak to you about, actually...

38:18.064 --> 38:19.765
before the power went out.

38:24.671 --> 38:29.008
This thing where I am
your deputy and your doctor...

38:29.943 --> 38:32.324
and your confidante and your friend...

38:32.358 --> 38:35.881
- That is a lot.
- Yeah, it is.

38:37.810 --> 38:39.978
And it's not working.

38:44.824 --> 38:49.428
All last night, we needed
to choose who to save,

38:49.462 --> 38:54.066
and every time,
you chose all of the above.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.834
- Yeah, I...
- No, that's not a criticism.

38:55.869 --> 38:58.611
I'm glad you did. You saved everyone.

38:58.939 --> 39:01.239
- We saved everyone.
- Yes.

39:01.875 --> 39:05.945
It worked out, but sometimes it doesn't.

39:05.979 --> 39:10.616
Sometimes you have to choose...

39:12.852 --> 39:14.377
And you couldn't.

39:16.587 --> 39:19.131
You just said it all worked out, and...

39:21.328 --> 39:22.795
I don't see what me not triaging patients

39:22.829 --> 39:24.387
has to do with...

39:27.373 --> 39:29.141
with us.

39:34.674 --> 39:37.358
It's what you do with
your cancer as well.

39:38.578 --> 39:40.946
You wanna stay healthy for your family,

39:40.981 --> 39:42.715
but you want to stay in charge
of the hospital.

39:42.749 --> 39:45.050
You want the chemo,
the strongest that we have,

39:45.085 --> 39:47.619
just not any of the side
effects that come with it.

39:47.654 --> 39:49.688
From the day this began,

39:49.723 --> 39:51.789
from the day we met,

39:52.859 --> 39:54.893
you have refused to choose.

39:54.928 --> 39:59.031
I'm not refusing, it's not that easy.

40:01.434 --> 40:04.003
Look, Helen, all I want is...

40:04.037 --> 40:05.671
Max.

40:08.375 --> 40:11.677
You want everything.

40:14.547 --> 40:16.188
It's who you are.

40:17.815 --> 40:20.552
You are all of the above.

40:22.055 --> 40:24.823
And then you come to me
with these demands,

40:24.858 --> 40:28.200
these inspiring...

40:29.062 --> 40:31.397
completely impossible demands,

40:31.431 --> 40:32.931
and I don't know who I'm supposed to be.

40:32.966 --> 40:34.666
You're supposed to be you.

40:34.701 --> 40:36.125
I've tried.

40:36.770 --> 40:40.406
I have tried to be all of the above.

40:40.774 --> 40:42.007
I can't.

40:45.545 --> 40:48.547
I can't be your friend and your doctor

40:48.581 --> 40:50.549
and your deputy, so I have to choose.

40:50.583 --> 40:52.808
I have to triage us.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.389
I'm gonna ask Dr. Stauton

40:57.424 --> 40:59.124
- to take over for me.
- No.

40:59.159 --> 41:00.559
She's an exceptional oncologist.

41:00.593 --> 41:02.528
- No, no! You don't...
- She'll be your new doctor, Max.

41:02.562 --> 41:05.196
She'll handle your care,
effective immediately.

41:08.501 --> 41:10.256
But what if I want you?

41:21.781 --> 41:24.116
Well, I'm afraid
that's no longer an option.

41:26.753 --> 41:31.156
Because we all want you.

41:32.305 --> 41:38.660
