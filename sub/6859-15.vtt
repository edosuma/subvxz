15:13.428 --> 15:15.930
Bane's capture was without purpose.

15:15.997 --> 15:16.931
<i>Yes.</i>

15:16.998 --> 15:19.032
<i>Yes, but we can make
this work for us.</i>

15:19.100 --> 15:22.169
<i>If they do try to escape, I
won't let them out of my sight.</i>

15:22.236 --> 15:25.171
<i>No doubt he shall lead us to
some answers about the plot</i>

15:25.238 --> 15:27.340
<i>and possibly to his superiors.</i>

15:27.407 --> 15:29.008
Good idea, Obi-Wan.

15:29.076 --> 15:30.710
Just don't blow your cover.

15:30.778 --> 15:33.813
It could take awhile to extract
you from prison.

15:33.881 --> 15:35.281
Not to worry.

15:35.349 --> 15:37.383
I'm starting to enjoy playing
the villain.

15:37.706 --> 15:39.058
Got to go.

15:50.945 --> 15:52.340
Hey, Hardeen.

15:54.816 --> 15:56.384
You owe me something.

15:56.451 --> 15:57.818
Oh, do I?

15:57.886 --> 15:59.786
You don't even remember me?

15:59.886 --> 16:01.510
That's very insulting

16:02.189 --> 16:04.424
look, kid, I don't want any trouble.

16:04.492 --> 16:06.959
You stole a bounty from me,

16:07.027 --> 16:08.561
and I want an apology!

16:08.629 --> 16:11.063
Kill him, Hardeen, like the Jedi!

16:11.131 --> 16:11.964
Kill him, Hardeen!

16:12.032 --> 16:13.667
What's wrong, Hardeen?
You lose your spine?

16:13.734 --> 16:14.801
You don't want to do this.

16:14.868 --> 16:15.995
Kill him!

16:19.138 --> 16:21.039
Oh, yes, I do.

16:21.107 --> 16:22.040
[Grunts]

16:22.108 --> 16:24.042
[Dishes clanking]

16:29.081 --> 16:30.949
I warned you.

16:31.017 --> 16:32.784
All right, all right, that's it

16:32.851 --> 16:33.518
fight's over!

16:33.585 --> 16:36.949
[Snarls] No, it ain't.

16:38.089 --> 16:41.091
You got a problem with Boba,

16:41.159 --> 16:42.746
you got a problem with me.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.231
[Dishes clanking]

16:47.299 --> 16:48.833
All right that's enough, big fella!

16:48.867 --> 16:52.036
[Electricity crackling]

16:52.103 --> 16:53.670
Hey, let's get 'em!

16:53.738 --> 16:55.306
Let's get them!

16:55.373 --> 16:56.340
Riot!

16:56.407 --> 16:57.341
Get the guards!

16:57.408 --> 16:58.042
Get them!

16:58.109 --> 16:58.909
Yeah!

16:58.977 --> 17:01.056
We need reinforcements in here now!

17:01.679 --> 17:03.147
Kill the guards!

17:03.215 --> 17:05.647
[Blaster firing]

17:05.715 --> 17:06.910
Riot!

17:07.251 --> 17:08.214
Riot!

17:09.819 --> 17:11.253
What do we do?

17:11.321 --> 17:13.289
Part of my plan.

17:13.357 --> 17:16.375
Paid off the kid to create
a diversion.

17:19.296 --> 17:22.231
[Blaster firing]

17:22.298 --> 17:24.233
Let's go.

17:34.610 --> 17:36.911
Facility on lock-down.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.213
Facility on lock-down.

17:39.281 --> 17:40.915
Facility on lock-down.

17:40.983 --> 17:42.383
Turn your weapons off stun.

17:42.450 --> 17:44.078
Kill the prisoners if you have to.

17:46.955 --> 17:48.923
Hey, wait for me.

17:48.991 --> 17:53.659
- No one invited you.
- He killed a Jedi.

17:53.727 --> 17:55.752
He cou b be helpful.

17:57.431 --> 17:58.365
Fine.

17:58.432 --> 18:00.133
We're wasting time.

18:05.006 --> 18:07.374
Ah, I'm telling you,

18:07.441 --> 18:09.474
it g gonna be a long night.

18:16.316 --> 18:18.217
This is our way out of here.

18:18.285 --> 18:19.785
The morgue?

18:19.852 --> 18:22.587
This is your brilliant plan?

18:22.925 --> 18:26.500
Not the first time I've
broken out of this stink hole.

18:32.231 --> 18:34.172
[Electronic beeping]

18:37.236 --> 18:39.170
The lock has changed.

18:39.238 --> 18:41.271
Your plan has failed.

18:41.372 --> 18:42.205
Shut up!

18:42.240 --> 18:43.325
Let me think.

18:45.870 --> 18:46.944
I can get us inside.

18:47.011 --> 18:48.946
I'll rewire the access port
on this door.

18:49.013 --> 18:51.516
It'll take some time, so warn me
if anyone comes.

18:51.636 --> 18:53.483
Make it quick...

19:04.527 --> 19:05.515
We're in.

19:09.699 --> 19:12.934
All the riot casualties are
sent to the crematorium.

19:13.002 --> 19:15.470
From there it's an easy escape.

19:15.537 --> 19:16.404
Another night, another riot.

19:16.472 --> 19:17.572
The guards are coming back.

19:17.639 --> 19:19.140
You said it, partner.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.276
You know, sometimes this makes
me wish I was on the front.

19:21.344 --> 19:24.346
I'll take blasting clankers
any day over this.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.746
Yeah, me too.

19:25.814 --> 19:27.915
Give me droids over this prison scum.

19:27.983 --> 19:31.418
After what just happened up
there, we'll need more room in here.

19:31.694 --> 19:33.020
You can say that again.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.627
Here, I'll send these to the
cremation center.

19:49.936 --> 19:50.936
Hey, wait.

19:51.005 --> 19:53.439
It looks like a couple of them
are showing vital signs.

19:53.507 --> 19:55.541
All right, I'll check it out.

20:00.279 --> 20:03.215
[Blaster firing]

20:08.787 --> 20:09.828
Whoa!

20:11.624 --> 20:13.625
[Alarm buzzing]

20:13.692 --> 20:15.227
What's the matter with you?

20:15.294 --> 20:17.294
My blaster jammed.

20:19.964 --> 20:21.899
Let's go.

20:24.236 --> 20:27.038
[Blaster firing]

20:28.504 --> 20:31.142
[Alarm blaring]

20:40.151 --> 20:42.352
[Blaster firing]

21:05.307 --> 21:08.846
Soon as we're off Coruscant,
we're safe.

21:20.621 --> 21:24.357
That's for hesitating during
the escape.

21:24.425 --> 21:26.726
If it wasn't for me, we'd
still be stuck in there.

21:26.794 --> 21:31.117
Yeah, funny how that worked out.

21:36.603 --> 21:37.946
Huh?

21:39.239 --> 21:41.003
Hey, my ship!

21:41.263 --> 21:42.941
Come back here!

21:45.545 --> 21:48.080
You did well in there, Hardeen.

21:48.148 --> 21:51.951
Maybe there's a place for you
in my plans after all.

21:52.357 --> 21:54.625
I'm listening.
