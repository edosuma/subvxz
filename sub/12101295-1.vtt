00:16.900 --> 00:19.817
(eerie whispering)

00:26.199 --> 00:28.949
(haunting music)

01:36.387 --> 01:39.810
- And you talk as if we
have nothing left here.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.190
- We can't keep living like this.

01:41.190 --> 01:42.750
- I want to fix this.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.360
- It doesn't seem like it.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.193
I can't keep doing this anymore-

01:45.193 --> 01:46.280
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

01:46.280 --> 01:48.150
but I think your washer's broken?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.900
- Oh, we've been meaning to get a new one,

01:50.900 --> 01:53.240
I'm so sorry about that.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.759
Greg will check it out for you.

01:54.759 --> 01:55.789
- [Girl] Thank you.

01:55.789 --> 01:57.250
- Is your room comfortable?

01:57.250 --> 01:58.410
- Yeah, it's great.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.060
- Feel free to use any part of the house.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.490
- Oh, I don't want to impose.

02:01.490 --> 02:02.323
- Nonsense.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.610
Greg and I will be in the
guest house across the way.

02:04.610 --> 02:05.620
- Oh.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.390
Not that I don't love my room or anything,

02:07.390 --> 02:10.870
but how come the guests don't
stay in the guest house?

02:10.870 --> 02:11.703
- Well, it actually-

02:11.703 --> 02:13.080
- We normally do that,

02:13.080 --> 02:15.460
just the water isn't running over there.

02:15.460 --> 02:16.420
- It's getting fixed, though.

02:16.420 --> 02:17.780
- Yeah.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.600
So, we'll be out of your hair.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.433
Yeah.

02:21.548 --> 02:22.599
- Let's go check it out.

02:22.599 --> 02:24.079
- Okay.

02:24.079 --> 02:25.079
- We'll be right back.

02:25.079 --> 02:25.912
- Okay.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.353
It won't turn on, and
everything's plugged in.

02:45.353 --> 02:46.187
- Hm.

02:48.089 --> 02:49.006
That's bad.

02:52.466 --> 02:53.383
Looks good.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.753
Hm.

03:08.753 --> 03:09.770
It seems to be fine now.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.370
- That's so weird.

03:11.370 --> 03:13.200
I did that like a hundred times.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.630
- That may have been the problem.

03:14.630 --> 03:16.600
- Oh, sorry.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.810
- It's okay.

03:17.810 --> 03:19.960
This thing is a little weird sometimes.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.440
- Yeah.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.390
Well, thanks for your help.

03:23.390 --> 03:25.630
- Let us know if you need anything else.

03:25.630 --> 03:26.463
- Will do.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.067
It's so weird.

03:51.589 --> 03:54.089
(eerie music)

04:02.764 --> 04:05.181
(whispering)

04:07.740 --> 04:11.330
(cell phone buzzes)

04:11.330 --> 04:12.163
Hey, sis.

04:13.660 --> 04:15.750
Yeah, I'm at the rental house now.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.190
It's cool.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.563
The house has character.

04:19.649 --> 04:22.533
Uh, the owners seem nice.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.070
No, they're not here.

04:26.070 --> 04:28.120
They're at the guest house.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.361
Right?

04:29.361 --> 04:30.361
Like, who has those?

04:31.917 --> 04:32.750
Mhm.

04:34.390 --> 04:35.560
Yeah.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.120
No, no, I wish I could've stayed there,

04:37.120 --> 04:39.773
but they said that the
water doesn't work, so.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.490
Anyway, what are you doing tonight?

04:44.070 --> 04:45.313
Nice.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.710
Well, I'm excited to see
you in a couple of days.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.522
Yeah, I'm excited to see you too.

04:59.350 --> 05:01.093
No, yeah, I know, I gotta focus.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.040
All right, love you.

05:04.443 --> 05:05.276
Bye.

05:08.234 --> 05:10.484
(creaking)

05:27.337 --> 05:30.004
(rattling)

05:30.004 --> 05:33.087
(cell phone ringing)

05:34.421 --> 05:37.004
(sink running)

05:49.269 --> 05:51.686
(whispering)

06:26.215 --> 06:31.215
(girl screaming)
(ominous music)

07:19.110 --> 07:20.027
- Oh, good.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.000
She really ate everything this time.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.740
- Your father's gonna be happy.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.633
- Yeah, he will.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.100
- Let me help you with that.

07:33.373 --> 07:35.740
- [Woman] I mean, she
seemed like a nice girl.

07:35.740 --> 07:36.573
- Yes, she did.

07:40.769 --> 07:41.602
(monster growling)

07:41.602 --> 07:43.120
- Ow!

07:43.120 --> 07:44.024
She bit me!

07:44.024 --> 07:44.857
- Step back!

07:44.857 --> 07:45.690
- That's never happened before!

07:45.690 --> 07:46.610
- It's still hungry!

07:46.610 --> 07:47.573
Let's go!

07:47.573 --> 07:49.213
Come on, come on!

07:50.079 --> 07:52.662
(sink running)

08:08.507 --> 08:11.424
(mysterious music)

08:50.660 --> 08:51.883
- I think I overpacked.

08:53.340 --> 08:54.290
- I don't think so.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.240
- Thanks for coming with me and stuff.

08:58.140 --> 09:01.066
- Yeah, I wouldn't let
you do it by yourself.

09:01.066 --> 09:02.850
Do you have the tickets
ready for everyone?

09:02.850 --> 09:05.100
- Uh, yeah, they can
scan it from our phones.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.800
- Oh, by the way, don't
forget an extra pair of shoes.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.910
- I'll get those later.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.783
- So, do you actually want
to start helping me pack?

09:19.640 --> 09:20.473
- Sure.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.170
- I'm gonna go get the olive oil.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.170
- Well, maybe we did overpack.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.463
- [Nicole] I cannot wait until graduation.

09:37.890 --> 09:39.660
- Well, you got one more year.

09:39.660 --> 09:40.720
- Yeah, I know.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.506
Miss Pierce seriously has it in for me.

09:43.506 --> 09:44.460
- It's all in your head.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.510
- No, I swear.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.410
She only calls on me for questions,

09:47.410 --> 09:50.920
and looks at me all weird
when I don't know the answer.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.490
- Well, what's your grade?

09:52.490 --> 09:53.323
- C-.

09:56.377 --> 09:59.020
- Well, I thought you
were good in that class.

09:59.020 --> 10:02.523
- I know, I just can't
concentrate anymore.

10:04.078 --> 10:05.630
- It'll be okay.

10:05.630 --> 10:06.463
- Yeah.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.480
I think this will be a fun weekend.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.660
So, how do you know Justin again?

10:13.660 --> 10:16.010
- I met him at that frat
party a couple months ago

10:16.010 --> 10:17.920
with the pool.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.477
- Oh, is he the one that-

10:19.477 --> 10:20.820
- (chuckles) Yeah.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.260
- Wow, well, I hope he
doesn't do that here.

10:23.260 --> 10:24.093
- He won't.

10:24.093 --> 10:26.301
He's bringing a girl.

10:26.301 --> 10:27.134
- Ugh.

10:27.134 --> 10:28.300
Erica, right?

10:28.300 --> 10:29.133
- Yeah.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.150
- She's the only one I haven't met before.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.823
- Yeah, she's pretty quiet,
she keeps to herself.

10:37.070 --> 10:37.933
- She'll be fine.

10:40.610 --> 10:43.363
Well, so much for them helping us pack.

10:45.690 --> 10:47.340
- Yeah, they should be here soon.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.350
- I'm gonna go check if I
left anything in the room.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.670
- Okay, I'll finish up out here.

10:56.261 --> 10:57.250
Hey, could you get my jacket?

10:57.250 --> 10:58.083
- Yeah.

11:02.415 --> 11:03.690
(knocking)

11:03.690 --> 11:04.636
Oh, that should be them

11:04.636 --> 11:07.232
- [Kyle] Party's here!

11:07.232 --> 11:08.065
(knocking)
Come on!

11:08.065 --> 11:09.040
- [Jena] Seriously, guys?

11:09.040 --> 11:11.070
- Woo, you guys ready for Venus tomorrow!

11:11.070 --> 11:12.426
Hey, how you doin'?
- Stop, Kyle.

11:12.426 --> 11:13.259
- What?

11:13.259 --> 11:14.506
- You're being so loud.
- Sup, man.

11:14.506 --> 11:15.339
- What up!

11:15.339 --> 11:16.172
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:16.172 --> 11:17.742
- Hi, I'm Erica.
- Hey, Nicole.

11:17.742 --> 11:19.550
- What up, man?
- Sup, man.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.533
- Hi, I'm Erica.

11:20.533 --> 11:21.583
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Chris.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.330
- You guys are in a good mood today.

11:24.330 --> 11:25.280
- Good mood?

11:25.280 --> 11:26.630
That traffic was killer, man.

11:26.630 --> 11:27.936
- Yeah, you ain't kiddin'.

11:27.936 --> 11:28.769
- I was stuck with him.

11:28.769 --> 11:30.690
- Oh my gosh.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.123
- Uh, when are we leaving?

11:32.123 --> 11:32.956
- Let's leave in an hour!

11:32.956 --> 11:33.789
I'm tired of sitting.

11:33.789 --> 11:35.150
- Don't be a drama queen.

11:35.150 --> 11:36.150
- Don't be a douche.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.803
- Uh, so, where's this festival thing at?

11:42.950 --> 11:45.210
- David something...

11:45.210 --> 11:47.270
- Actually, we should get going.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.410
- Yeah, the drive up here
was killer on traffic.

11:49.410 --> 11:50.981
- If you didn't take
forever in the shower.

11:50.981 --> 11:51.820
- Oh my gosh.

11:51.820 --> 11:53.970
Yeah, well, you gotta
do what you gotta do.

11:54.810 --> 11:57.520
- Yeah, we should get
going, we can't be late.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.120
- Why not?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.159
- Well, it's like, you know...

12:01.159 --> 12:03.619
- You don't want to be
driving in the dark.

12:03.619 --> 12:04.520
- Ugh.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.110
- Don't do that.
- Shut up!

12:06.110 --> 12:07.080
- [Kyle] You shut up!

12:07.080 --> 12:07.970
- [Jena] You shut up!

12:07.970 --> 12:08.803
- We should go pack the-

12:08.803 --> 12:09.636
- [Jena] You're so annoying!

12:09.636 --> 12:10.469
- I'm not annoying!
- Yes, you are.

12:10.469 --> 12:12.460
- Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.

12:12.460 --> 12:13.930
Let's go, come on.

12:13.930 --> 12:14.763
- Whatever.

12:20.706 --> 12:21.539
- Come on, girl.

12:21.539 --> 12:23.229
I just got paid, but I
mean, it's for the trip.

12:23.229 --> 12:25.190
- [Chris] Justin, let's go!

12:25.190 --> 12:26.543
- Come on, man!

12:36.700 --> 12:37.533
- Okay.

12:37.533 --> 12:40.720
All right, guys, we need these
two boxes right here to go,

12:40.720 --> 12:42.623
and everything that's on the counter.

12:45.128 --> 12:45.961
- All right.

12:45.961 --> 12:46.794
You guys want some chips?

12:46.794 --> 12:47.707
You can take 'em out.

12:47.707 --> 12:48.540
- Thank you.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.200
- Guys, yeah, no, we
really need to get going.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.200
- Whose house is it?

12:52.470 --> 12:54.400
- You know, we just
have to get there early,

12:54.400 --> 12:55.680
landlord's rules.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.950
- Who's the owner?

12:56.950 --> 13:00.480
- Some guy, I'm not sure,
I don't remember his name.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.522
Yeah, but we really need to
get these bags in the car.

13:02.522 --> 13:03.834
- [Chris] Yeah, you
want to take these out?

13:03.834 --> 13:04.667
- Yeah.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.785
- The box too?
- Yep.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.452
- Let's go, I guess.

13:13.157 --> 13:14.140
We got everything?

13:14.140 --> 13:14.973
All right.

13:30.486 --> 13:31.319
(car honks)

13:31.319 --> 13:32.152
- [Alexis] Hi, guys!

13:32.152 --> 13:32.985
- Who's that?

13:35.370 --> 13:36.483
- Why is she here?

13:38.235 --> 13:39.680
I thought she was at school.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.770
Oh my God, what is she doing here?

13:40.770 --> 13:41.700
- [Chris] Did you invite her?

13:41.700 --> 13:42.533
- No, I didn't.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.080
How did she even know about this?

13:44.080 --> 13:45.820
- I don't know, don't look at me.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.090
She's your friend.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.300
- Oh my gosh.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.000
- [Alexis] Surprise!

13:50.000 --> 13:52.940
- Alexis, oh my God,
what are you doing here?

13:52.940 --> 13:54.190
- My test was last week,

13:54.190 --> 13:56.203
so I thought I'd surprise you today!

13:57.110 --> 13:58.260
- [Nicole] Do you have a ticket?

13:58.260 --> 13:59.220
- Duh!

13:59.220 --> 14:01.040
- I don't know if we're
gonna have enough beds.

14:01.040 --> 14:01.900
- What are you talking about?

14:01.900 --> 14:04.020
This place is supposed to be huge.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.870
- [Nicole] I know, it's
just I told the landlord

14:05.870 --> 14:07.520
a certain amount of beds to prep.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.960
- [Alexis] That's what couches are for.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.793
What's wrong?

14:12.050 --> 14:14.253
- Nothing, I'm surprised
to see you is all.

14:15.190 --> 14:16.930
- I thought you would want me to come.

14:16.930 --> 14:19.690
- I do, I do, you know,
I'm just surprised.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.330
Are you sure you want to come?

14:21.330 --> 14:24.388
- Well, I don't want to drive
all the way back, so yeah.

14:24.388 --> 14:26.733
- Do any of you know her?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.860
- I don't know her.

14:28.860 --> 14:31.633
- All right, well, let's
get goin' everyone.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.630
How was your test?

14:34.630 --> 14:35.463
- Pretty good.

14:35.463 --> 14:38.860
Hopefully I got an A, I'm
not really sure, but it's-

14:38.860 --> 14:41.007
- I mean, you were
studying your ass off, so.

14:41.007 --> 14:41.840
(chuckling)

14:41.840 --> 14:42.869
- Guess we're going, we're going.

14:42.869 --> 14:45.169
- All right, let's go.

14:45.169 --> 14:46.673
Yeah, baby, you got it.

14:46.673 --> 14:51.156
- [Justin] You're strong,
independent women.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.156
(car doors closing)

14:59.866 --> 15:02.366
(engine revs)

15:04.218 --> 15:07.218
(catchy rock music)

15:39.820 --> 15:41.070
- So, where are we going?

15:42.070 --> 15:45.090
- [Nicole] Um, it's just this huge place

15:45.090 --> 15:47.580
out by the music festival.

15:47.580 --> 15:52.270
- Yeah, it's like this
property that's close to it,

15:52.270 --> 15:53.130
it's not connected to it,

15:53.130 --> 15:54.843
we're just gonna stay there.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.000
- So, do you guys know like
exactly where we're going?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.991
Have you been there before?

15:59.991 --> 16:01.930
- [Kyle] I haven't been there, no.

16:01.930 --> 16:04.130
- I'm excited to graduate school,

16:04.130 --> 16:05.940
try to get workin'.

16:05.940 --> 16:08.270
- Yeah, that's after this semester, right?

16:08.270 --> 16:10.120
- [Chris] Yeah, yup.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.180
Coming up soon.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.750
I'm just...

16:12.750 --> 16:14.820
This will be like a
quick little celebration,

16:14.820 --> 16:18.290
and then man, I just can't
wait for the end of school.

16:18.290 --> 16:20.890
- [Nicole] I know, you're
so lucky you're almost done.

16:20.890 --> 16:22.103
- So checked out.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.560
- [Alexis] I think that's
everyone when they're in school.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.393
It just sucks.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.510
- Yeah, it really does.

16:30.510 --> 16:34.020
I'm just like, literally
don't think my mind

16:34.020 --> 16:35.330
can handle anything else.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.630
- Sounds like fun, have you guys been

16:38.630 --> 16:39.910
to the music festival at least,

16:39.910 --> 16:41.250
or is this like, new for you guys too?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.850
- [Jena] No, it's a first.

16:42.850 --> 16:45.448
I've never been to a music festival.

16:45.448 --> 16:46.860
- [Justin] Yes, it's pretty cool.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.262
Lovely ladies.

16:48.262 --> 16:49.650
(laughing)

16:49.650 --> 16:50.723
- I'm sure you know.

16:53.386 --> 16:54.660
- [Alexis] And it's just a rental?

16:54.660 --> 16:56.190
- Yeah, we're just hanging out there

16:56.190 --> 16:57.120
for a little bit,

16:57.120 --> 16:59.620
and then we're gonna hit
up the music festival.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.260
So, it should be fun.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.810
I'm excited about it.

17:02.810 --> 17:03.780
- [Chris] Yeah.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.287
- [Justin] So, it's only gonna
be like us in there, right?

17:05.287 --> 17:06.685
In the house?

17:06.685 --> 17:07.924
Nobody else?

17:07.924 --> 17:08.757
- [Erica] I think so.

17:08.757 --> 17:11.210
- Well, I don't know, Alexis showed up.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.042
That's her name, right?

17:12.042 --> 17:12.876
Alexis?

17:12.876 --> 17:13.760
- [Justin] Yeah.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.690
I think I remember her.

17:14.690 --> 17:16.032
- [Jena] Why?

17:16.032 --> 17:17.750
- What do you mean why?

17:17.750 --> 17:18.940
- [Justin] Asking too many questions, man.

17:18.940 --> 17:20.686
- [Jena] You sound interested.

17:20.686 --> 17:21.800
- I'm not interested.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.750
Just, if we're gonna spend
the weekend with this person,

17:23.750 --> 17:26.030
it'd probably be a good
idea to know her name.

17:26.030 --> 17:27.196
- [Jena] Okay.

17:31.007 --> 17:33.507
(eerie music)

18:04.880 --> 18:07.380
(tense music)

18:15.360 --> 18:17.491
- It's so rainy outside.

18:17.491 --> 18:19.370
- [Kyle] Yeah, but that's
not gonna stop us partying.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.203
- [Justin] It's not too bad.

18:20.203 --> 18:21.599
A couple of drinks, you'll be all right.

18:21.599 --> 18:22.432
- [Kyle] Right?

18:22.432 --> 18:24.459
We'll still set up the
barbecue, the beer pong.

18:24.459 --> 18:25.750
- [Justin] Beer pong, that's
what I'm talking about.

18:25.750 --> 18:26.583
- [Kyle] Right?

18:26.583 --> 18:28.533
You'll forget 5 minutes into it, if that.

18:32.357 --> 18:33.307
- [Chris] You okay?

18:35.270 --> 18:37.423
- Yeah, I'm just getting tired of driving.

18:40.907 --> 18:42.300
(Justin yawns)

18:42.300 --> 18:44.191
- [Kyle] Falling asleep up there, man?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.764
- Nah, not yet.

18:45.764 --> 18:46.691
- Do you want me to drive?

18:46.691 --> 18:48.941
- I'm all right, thank you.

18:50.391 --> 18:52.891
(eerie music)

19:11.407 --> 19:13.963
- I'm so glad we're finally here.

19:13.963 --> 19:14.796
- Right?

19:14.796 --> 19:15.629
- [Kyle] Finally, yo.

19:15.629 --> 19:17.629
- The drive was so long.

19:18.930 --> 19:21.070
(groaning)

19:21.070 --> 19:22.120
- Finally, man.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.570
- Get the stretching out,
get the stretching out.

19:29.110 --> 19:31.040
- You must be Merlin,
we spoke over the phone.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.220
- Yeah, of course.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.200
- I'm Nicole, this is everybody.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.390
- Chris.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.223
- Kyle.
- Jena.

19:36.223 --> 19:37.160
- How you doin', I'm Justin.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.733
- Erica.
- Hi, I'm Alexis.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.250
- Okay, so that's all 6 of you?

19:42.250 --> 19:44.730
- [Nicole] Actually, 7 now.

19:44.730 --> 19:45.563
- [Merlin] Oh.

19:45.563 --> 19:47.380
- [Nicole] That shouldn't
be a problem, right?

19:47.380 --> 19:48.373
- I guess not.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.800
- So, do you have Wi-Fi?

19:52.970 --> 19:55.410
- Well, I did.

19:55.410 --> 19:58.243
But she died a few years back.

19:59.450 --> 20:00.513
- I mean internet.

20:01.720 --> 20:05.163
- Well, we got a phone line y'all can use.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.510
- [Jena] A phone line?

20:07.510 --> 20:08.730
- [Kyle] Wow.

20:08.730 --> 20:09.600
- [Jena] What?

20:09.600 --> 20:11.570
- [Nicole] We won't need
Wi-Fi here, it's fine.

20:11.570 --> 20:12.920
- At least there's service.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.130
- Well, bedrooms are upstairs,

20:19.130 --> 20:23.050
and I laid out some food
for y'all in the pantry,

20:23.050 --> 20:24.807
and if you need anything else,

20:24.807 --> 20:26.870
you know how to reach me.

20:26.870 --> 20:28.357
- I have your number.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.850
- All right, well, let's
get settled in, shall we?

20:30.850 --> 20:31.980
- Okay, awesome.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.500
- Yeah, let's go unpack.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.573
- I need to shower.

20:34.573 --> 20:35.406
(laughing)

20:35.406 --> 20:37.530
- Well then, I'll leave y'all to it.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.530
- Thank you very much.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.770
- Yeah, thanks.

20:39.770 --> 20:40.776
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

20:40.776 --> 20:42.700
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.150
- Is he really just gonna
be here the whole time?

20:46.106 --> 20:47.620
- It's whatever.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.553
- [Nicole] Yeah, I'm sure
he won't be a bother.

20:53.137 --> 20:55.592
- Okay.
- All right.

20:55.592 --> 20:56.425
All right.

20:56.425 --> 20:57.728
- Yeah, we finally made it here!

20:57.728 --> 20:58.561
- Woo!

21:01.855 --> 21:04.355
(eerie music)

21:09.846 --> 21:12.429
(birds cawing)

21:21.231 --> 21:23.148
- [Chris] Are you okay?

21:25.168 --> 21:27.751
(Nicole sighs)

21:28.660 --> 21:30.133
- I wish Alexis weren't here.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.223
- Me too.

21:37.710 --> 21:40.993
But, she is.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.313
- How are we gonna get her to leave?

21:49.250 --> 21:50.083
- We'll figure it out.

21:50.083 --> 21:55.080
I can tell her there's some
emergency that's happened.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.840
- Maybe the landlord.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.630
We can say that he didn't
want an extra person here,

22:02.630 --> 22:04.253
and that she has to go.

22:05.550 --> 22:06.383
- Yeah.

22:07.989 --> 22:09.110
- [Nicole] But how are
we gonna get her back?

22:09.110 --> 22:10.063
We drove her here.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.050
- Yeah, we do have the car.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.996
I'll take her back in the morning,

22:17.996 --> 22:19.583
and you just stay here with everyone.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.333
- Yeah, yeah.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.463
I can handle it.

22:33.970 --> 22:34.820
- It'll work out.

22:38.170 --> 22:40.407
(lighthearted game music)

22:40.407 --> 22:41.350
- What are you playing?

22:41.350 --> 22:42.590
- It's this new game that came out,

22:42.590 --> 22:44.640
it's called Passive Aggressive Birds.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.490
It's pretty cool.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.633
- Cool.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.230
You know, a lot of people
are going tomorrow.

22:50.230 --> 22:51.063
- Really?

22:51.063 --> 22:52.273
Like who?

22:52.273 --> 22:56.920
Like Mike, Sam, Ash, the twins,

22:56.920 --> 22:57.823
like a bunch more.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.270
- You know what we should do?

23:00.270 --> 23:01.550
We should bring them back here tonight

23:01.550 --> 23:03.174
and have a party.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.830
- Do you think Merlin would mind?

23:04.830 --> 23:05.663
- Who cares?

23:05.663 --> 23:06.670
We rented the place.

23:06.670 --> 23:08.320
- For 7, not 20.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.053
- Oh, he'll hardly notice
if Mark and Shay show up.

23:12.665 --> 23:13.723
- You're so bad.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.080
- Uh...

23:19.040 --> 23:20.253
No, not really.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.451
Texts won't go through.

23:23.451 --> 23:24.284
- Hm.

23:24.284 --> 23:25.360
- You got any service?

23:26.380 --> 23:28.533
- Yeah, but it's in and out.

23:29.820 --> 23:31.640
Okay, selfie time.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.803
- Give me one second.

23:34.570 --> 23:35.403
All right.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.000
(camera shutter snaps)

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
- What do you think?

23:42.710 --> 23:43.987
- It's okay.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.310
- Can I take another one?

23:45.310 --> 23:46.860
- Yeah, let's take another one.

23:48.550 --> 23:49.490
- Goofy or cute?

23:49.490 --> 23:50.593
- Oh, let's do goofy.

23:51.754 --> 23:54.570
(camera shutter snaps)

23:54.570 --> 23:55.930
So much better!
(laughing)

23:55.930 --> 23:57.041
So much better.

23:57.041 --> 23:58.290
(laughing)

23:58.290 --> 23:59.844
- Okay, I gotta post it to Instagram.

23:59.844 --> 24:00.844
- All right.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.633
- Or not.

24:05.616 --> 24:06.580
- Weird, should I get anything?

24:06.580 --> 24:07.423
- No.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.860
- Man, they really picked
the middle of nowhere,

24:09.860 --> 24:10.693
didn't they?

24:13.190 --> 24:14.370
- What do you think this festival's

24:14.370 --> 24:15.520
gonna be like tomorrow?

24:16.730 --> 24:18.820
- A lot of drinking, a lot of drinking,

24:18.820 --> 24:19.880
staying on the subject.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.840
Uh...
(laughing)

24:22.840 --> 24:24.450
Yeah, I've been to one
a couple of years ago,

24:24.450 --> 24:26.190
it was before I knew you, but yeah,

24:26.190 --> 24:28.520
there's a lot of people,
a lot of drinking,

24:28.520 --> 24:29.420
a lot of partying.

24:30.288 --> 24:31.620
But the music's normally good.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.440
They got a couple of good
bands coming tomorrow,

24:33.440 --> 24:35.286
so it should be all right.

24:35.286 --> 24:36.240
- Yeah, I guess if you're that drunk

24:36.240 --> 24:37.763
you're not really gonna notice.

24:37.763 --> 24:38.700
- Yeah, it's like all the bands

24:38.700 --> 24:40.620
just kinda morph into one band.

24:40.620 --> 24:41.580
(laughing)

24:41.580 --> 24:43.420
And then you like wonder why
that band's been up there

24:43.420 --> 24:44.295
for like 3 hours.

24:44.295 --> 24:46.783
- (laughs) Right.
- 3 hours.

24:46.783 --> 24:48.096
It's really been like 2 or 3 bands.

24:48.096 --> 24:48.929
(laughing)

24:48.929 --> 24:50.380
Like, they can't be that good.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.930
(whispering)

24:53.930 --> 24:55.550
- Who was that?

24:55.550 --> 24:56.810
- Eh, it's an old house,

24:56.810 --> 24:59.418
it's probably settling or something.

24:59.418 --> 25:01.059
(creaking)

25:01.059 --> 25:03.892
- I don't know, that seemed weird.

25:05.013 --> 25:07.463
- Well, it's just an old house.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.000
Old houses make noises.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.300
I wouldn't worry about it.

25:15.662 --> 25:16.495
- If you say so.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.189
(Justin yawns)

25:21.189 --> 25:22.890
- I'm tired.

25:22.890 --> 25:24.030
- I'm exhausted.

25:24.030 --> 25:26.340
It was such a long car ride.

25:26.340 --> 25:29.030
- Yeah, you're lucky you
didn't have to drive.

25:29.030 --> 25:30.650
- It's not like I was able to relax,

25:30.650 --> 25:32.260
I was panicking while you were driving,

25:32.260 --> 25:33.670
you were driving like a crazy person.

25:33.670 --> 25:35.600
- No, I wasn't, I was driving slow.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.300
Everybody was complaining.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.100
- Yeah, but you were driving my car.

25:42.380 --> 25:47.343
- Well, now we're in this room, alone.

25:49.670 --> 25:51.223
- Are you expecting something?

25:52.170 --> 25:53.093
- No, no.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.413
Are you?

25:56.250 --> 25:57.723
- No, you know I'm waiting.

25:59.040 --> 25:59.873
- Right.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.340
Are you comfortable with everybody here?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.093
- Yeah, sure, why?

26:10.039 --> 26:13.018
- Just making sure.

26:13.018 --> 26:15.333
- Just, I really need to shower.

26:16.410 --> 26:17.760
- [Justin] Want me to join?

26:19.580 --> 26:21.520
- I would, but I just remembered

26:21.520 --> 26:23.600
there's a bath jacuzzi
in the other bathroom.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.573
- Sounds like fun.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.490
- Yeah.

26:28.490 --> 26:29.463
Bathtub for one.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.453
- We could fit.

26:32.750 --> 26:33.670
- Hell no!

26:33.670 --> 26:35.743
I'm not squeezing in a jacuzzi with you.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.120
I'm here to relax, remember?

26:39.750 --> 26:42.143
- All right, you relax.

26:43.430 --> 26:46.020
I'll get the barbecue started.

26:46.020 --> 26:46.853
- Barbecue?

26:46.853 --> 26:48.350
It's like 30 degrees outside.

26:48.350 --> 26:50.600
- Yeah, the guys wanted to do it.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.700
Plus, we have a fire pit,

26:51.700 --> 26:53.280
so we might as well take advantage

26:53.280 --> 26:54.880
of what this house has to offer.

26:56.060 --> 26:57.780
- Okay, well, don't wait up for me.

26:57.780 --> 26:58.730
I might be a while.

26:59.713 --> 27:00.546
- Okay.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.060
Guys!

27:06.060 --> 27:06.893
I'm hungry!

27:09.270 --> 27:11.370
- [Erica] I don't think they heard you.

27:11.370 --> 27:13.020
- Yeah, I'll get 'em in a second.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.400
- Hey, you're still in here?

27:19.400 --> 27:22.150
- Yeah, I just really
wanted to use this bathtub.

27:22.150 --> 27:22.983
- Yeah, I know.

27:22.983 --> 27:24.700
Definitely take advantage of the house.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.310
Here, take a candle.

27:26.310 --> 27:28.050
- Thanks, did you bring these?

27:28.050 --> 27:29.810
- No, I found them in the room here.

27:29.810 --> 27:30.910
- Okay, cool, thank you.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.080
- Yeah, no problem.

27:32.080 --> 27:32.990
We'll see you outside?

27:32.990 --> 27:34.180
- Yeah, I'll see you soon.

27:34.180 --> 27:35.013
- Perfect.

27:47.544 --> 27:50.044
(eerie music)

28:07.790 --> 28:08.623
- Ah!

28:08.623 --> 28:09.456
- It's so cold.

28:09.456 --> 28:11.870
- I know, we get a whole
house, and we're still outside.

28:11.870 --> 28:13.270
- I know!

28:13.270 --> 28:14.360
You would think that they would just-

28:14.360 --> 28:17.110
- Don't worry, guys,
these will warm you up.

28:17.110 --> 28:20.410
- [Alexis] Thank God, 'cause
it's so freakin' cold!

28:20.410 --> 28:22.230
- I brought extra blankets.

28:22.230 --> 28:24.345
- That's okay, this will be my blanket.

28:24.345 --> 28:25.178
(laughing)

28:25.178 --> 28:26.130
- Cool!

28:26.130 --> 28:27.420
We should do shots.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.520
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

28:29.390 --> 28:30.860
- We got coconut liquor.

28:30.860 --> 28:32.220
- Oh, yum!

28:32.220 --> 28:33.920
- That's a recipe for a hangover.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.141
- It's delicious.

28:35.141 --> 28:36.148
- Delicious.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.710
(chuckling)

28:37.710 --> 28:39.800
- Hey, perfect timing!

28:39.800 --> 28:41.113
Getting ready to do shots.

28:42.270 --> 28:43.540
- Are we?

28:43.540 --> 28:44.810
- [Chris] Guess so.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.390
- [Nicole] All right,
just this one for me.

28:46.390 --> 28:47.489
- That's what they all say.

28:47.489 --> 28:48.563
(laughing)

28:48.563 --> 28:49.569
- Ready?

28:49.569 --> 28:50.495
- Nicole.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.565
- [Nicole] Thank you.

28:51.565 --> 28:52.398
- Chris.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.704
- All right, to Venus.

28:54.704 --> 28:55.765
- [All] To Venus.

28:55.765 --> 28:58.015
(cheering)

29:02.690 --> 29:05.240
- Oh my gosh, do you guys
remember that frat party

29:05.240 --> 29:07.290
where Justin got so schwasted-

29:07.290 --> 29:08.712
- [Justin] Let's not talk about that.

29:08.712 --> 29:10.860
(laughing)

29:10.860 --> 29:12.060
- And disturbing.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.230
- Hey!

29:13.230 --> 29:15.170
I was a different man back then.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.800
- What, two months ago?

29:16.800 --> 29:17.633
- Yeah!

29:17.633 --> 29:19.090
Life changing things have happened to me.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.073
- [Kyle] Oh my lord.

29:20.073 --> 29:21.038
- He's talking about Erica.

29:21.038 --> 29:22.040
- Aw!
- Aw!

29:22.040 --> 29:23.110
So cute.

29:23.110 --> 29:24.650
- Not a big deal, guys.

29:24.650 --> 29:26.213
I'm allowed to like a girl.

29:27.816 --> 29:30.566
(shower running)

30:06.780 --> 30:08.940
- Does she know about the frat party?

30:08.940 --> 30:11.900
- No, and I'd appreciate
it if no one told her.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.620
- Well, can someone tell me?

30:13.620 --> 30:15.060
I wasn't there.

30:15.060 --> 30:15.893
- Can I tell her?

30:15.893 --> 30:16.726
Can I tell her?

30:16.726 --> 30:17.559
- Hurry up.

30:17.559 --> 30:18.770
- Okay, all right.

30:18.770 --> 30:19.603
Yes!

30:19.603 --> 30:21.670
Okay, so we're at this
rich guy's frat house

30:21.670 --> 30:23.610
like right off of campus, okay?

30:23.610 --> 30:26.430
And Justin was so drunk,

30:26.430 --> 30:28.860
that he was laying by the
sliding glass door all night

30:28.860 --> 30:30.410
humping it.

30:30.410 --> 30:33.417
He was so drunk he didn't know
what the hell was going on!

30:33.417 --> 30:34.750
(laughing)

30:34.750 --> 30:36.530
- [Alexis] Well, that's not that bad!

30:36.530 --> 30:38.410
- Well, that was before he started

30:38.410 --> 30:40.710
puking everywhere all night,

30:40.710 --> 30:42.610
except for the toilet!

30:42.610 --> 30:43.910
- Okay.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.920
Who's next on embarrassing stories?

30:45.920 --> 30:48.280
- I've got a few about
Alexis I could share.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.113
- Me?

30:49.113 --> 30:50.480
What about you?

30:50.480 --> 30:51.313
- Oh, please!

30:51.313 --> 30:52.710
Do you remember the toga party night?

30:52.710 --> 30:55.680
- Oh, toga, toga!

30:55.680 --> 30:58.430
- Well, we were trying to get
into this other frat party,

30:58.430 --> 31:00.180
and we were sitting on
the hill in front of it,

31:00.180 --> 31:01.540
and drunk as I was,

31:01.540 --> 31:02.700
I thought it was a great idea

31:02.700 --> 31:05.540
if I pushed Alexis down the hill.

31:05.540 --> 31:07.790
And of course, as she's
rolling down the hill,

31:07.790 --> 31:10.177
her toga completely unravels

31:10.177 --> 31:12.896
leaving her just in a bra and shorts.

31:12.896 --> 31:14.100
(laughing)

31:14.100 --> 31:14.933
Yeah.

31:14.933 --> 31:16.550
And then, so she's walking home

31:16.550 --> 31:19.092
with a blanket around her
like a homeless person...

31:19.092 --> 31:19.925
(laughing)

31:19.925 --> 31:22.250
- It happened, guys, okay?

31:22.250 --> 31:25.700
- But that was before she got on the bus

31:25.700 --> 31:27.720
as this homeless person

31:27.720 --> 31:29.140
and runs into her crush.

31:29.140 --> 31:29.973
- [Kyle] Oh, no!

31:31.191 --> 31:32.500
- Guys, guys, it's okay.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.070
I got his number.

31:34.070 --> 31:35.800
- [Kyle] Hey, there you go.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.390
- I totally forgot about that.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.016
- Oh, God, yeah, such a great night.

31:39.016 --> 31:40.078
(laughing)

31:40.078 --> 31:42.420
- I don't know, I don't think
that tops humping doors.

31:42.420 --> 31:43.972
- [Kyle] Definitely does not.

31:43.972 --> 31:44.980
(laughing)

31:44.980 --> 31:46.668
- [Nicole] Yeah, nobody
wanted to see that.

31:46.668 --> 31:47.572
(laughing)

31:47.572 --> 31:48.405
- [Kyle] We did not.

31:48.405 --> 31:50.300
- [Justin] Glad I don't
remember that night.

32:10.518 --> 32:13.018
(eerie music)

32:40.415 --> 32:42.360
- [Chris] Justin, I want to
rematch you in beer pong.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.610
- Yeah, man, let's do it.

32:45.550 --> 32:48.170
After this stomach baby goes down.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.230
- [Nicole] You guys okay?

32:51.230 --> 32:52.063
- Oh, yeah.

32:52.063 --> 32:53.743
Trust me, we're good.

32:53.743 --> 32:55.589
- [Chris] All right, have fun, you two.

32:55.589 --> 32:57.732
(laughing)

32:57.732 --> 32:59.282
- At least somebody's doing it.

33:00.580 --> 33:03.540
- [Nicole] Sound a little
jealous there, Alexis.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.593
- Party full of couples.

33:06.607 --> 33:09.524
(mysterious music)

33:24.160 --> 33:25.610
- This place is so beautiful.

33:26.710 --> 33:27.660
- You're beautiful.

33:29.846 --> 33:32.099
- Do you think there are bears around?

33:32.099 --> 33:34.499
- No, Chris didn't say
anything about any bears.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.470
- What about snakes or raccoons?

33:38.440 --> 33:39.663
- Just relax!

33:40.970 --> 33:43.020
Nicole said this place got great reviews.

33:46.563 --> 33:48.240
(eerie music)

33:48.240 --> 33:50.058
- What was that?

33:50.058 --> 33:52.200
- Nothing, it was probably
just the water or something.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.063
Just relax, everything will be fine!

33:57.443 --> 33:59.257
(eerie music)

33:59.257 --> 34:00.740
- What was that?

34:00.740 --> 34:02.953
- Chris, Justin, is that you?

34:08.533 --> 34:09.683
- That was weird.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.449
- Probably just messing
with us or something.

34:12.449 --> 34:13.853
You know how they are.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.949
- [Alexis] Who wants some more drinks?

34:20.949 --> 34:22.929
- [Nicole] You sure you want some more?

34:22.929 --> 34:24.480
- Are we here to party or what?

34:25.780 --> 34:26.909
- True.

34:26.909 --> 34:28.860
- [Alexis] Exactly.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.130
(laughing)

34:30.130 --> 34:33.213
- Let's bet who's gonna be
the first to pass out tonight.

34:34.230 --> 34:35.341
- [All] Alexis.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.174
(laughing)

34:36.174 --> 34:37.340
- No, I won't.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.400
- I really believe you will.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.373
- You never know.

34:41.540 --> 34:44.233
- Does anyone else get a
weird vibe from this place?

34:45.409 --> 34:46.581
- [Chris] No.

34:46.581 --> 34:49.053
- I don't know, maybe
it's just in my head.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.210
- Wait.

34:52.210 --> 34:55.600
Is that Merlin in the guest house?

34:55.600 --> 34:58.723
- Um, yeah, but he's probably
sleeping already though.

34:59.750 --> 35:00.583
- That's weird.

35:05.183 --> 35:06.890
I think I drank too much,

35:06.890 --> 35:08.963
I'm starting to see things.

35:09.930 --> 35:12.380
- Maybe you should check on Erica.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.203
- She's been in there for a while.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.543
- Yeah, I should.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.851
After this beer.

35:18.851 --> 35:21.184
(chuckling)

35:23.750 --> 35:24.583
Man down.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.406
(eerie music)

35:57.817 --> 36:02.817
(Erica choking)
(water splashing)

36:18.345 --> 36:21.012
(ominous music)

36:43.705 --> 36:45.210
- You're pretty good at beer pong.

36:45.210 --> 36:47.176
- You know, I've had my practice.

36:47.176 --> 36:48.900
(chuckling)

36:48.900 --> 36:50.990
- Weren't you supposed
to go check on Erica?

36:50.990 --> 36:53.410
- Yeah, but she said she
was gonna take a while,

36:53.410 --> 36:56.010
and I'm sure she's all right.

36:56.010 --> 36:58.287
Plus she said she wanted to "relax".

37:00.208 --> 37:02.708
(eerie music)

37:38.343 --> 37:41.010
(ominous music)

37:47.471 --> 37:50.040
- I'm cold and scared.

37:50.040 --> 37:50.873
- Here.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.893
This and me will keep you warm.

37:57.371 --> 38:00.180
- I guess they're just
trying to scare us, huh?

38:00.180 --> 38:01.630
- Not if I get to them first.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.470
Chris!

38:06.470 --> 38:07.303
Justin, where are you?

38:07.303 --> 38:09.280
- [Jena] Kyle, what are you doing?

38:09.280 --> 38:10.330
- Trying to find 'em!

38:11.330 --> 38:12.660
Shit.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.903
Guys, you are good at hiding.

38:17.210 --> 38:19.000
Where are you guys?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.600
- Kyle?

38:20.600 --> 38:21.793
- I heard you.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.443
You are not fooling me tonight.

38:26.900 --> 38:30.043
Chris, Justin, where are you?

38:32.499 --> 38:34.953
- I don't like being alone,
can you just come back?

38:38.670 --> 38:40.490
Kyle, I can't see you.

38:40.490 --> 38:41.690
- [Kyle] I'm right here!

38:44.010 --> 38:45.550
- Kyle, come back!

38:45.550 --> 38:46.383
- What's wrong?

38:49.237 --> 38:54.237
(screaming)
(intense music)

38:56.996 --> 38:59.219
Jena!

38:59.219 --> 39:00.052
Jena!

39:02.290 --> 39:03.610
Jena, where are you?

39:04.530 --> 39:05.793
Guys, help!

39:12.036 --> 39:12.869
- [Justin] Are you okay?

39:12.869 --> 39:14.228
- What happened?

39:14.228 --> 39:15.061
- Where's Jena?

39:16.127 --> 39:17.270
- I don't know, I heard her screaming

39:17.270 --> 39:19.120
and I ran back over here, she was gone.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.340
- [Alexis] Well, where was she?

39:20.340 --> 39:22.290
- She was sitting right
here on this ledge.

39:22.290 --> 39:23.400
- [Justin] Okay, we
shouldn't be out here then.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.100
- We need to find her!

39:25.100 --> 39:26.090
- What do you think it was?

39:26.090 --> 39:28.090
- I have no idea, I didn't see anything!

39:30.450 --> 39:31.360
Jena!

39:31.360 --> 39:32.670
- [Alexis] We can't go in there.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.020
- But she's probably in there!

39:35.020 --> 39:36.009
Jena!

39:36.009 --> 39:36.842
- Jena!

39:40.100 --> 39:41.877
- I need to check on Erica.

39:41.877 --> 39:42.710
Come on!

39:44.148 --> 39:46.329
- Kyle, come on, you can't stay out here.

39:46.329 --> 39:48.996
(intense music)

40:07.160 --> 40:09.993
(heavy breathing)

40:13.739 --> 40:15.322
- Anyone out there?

40:18.647 --> 40:19.927
(knocking)
Help!

40:19.927 --> 40:21.584
Kyle!

40:21.584 --> 40:23.667
Kyle, get me out of here!

40:26.509 --> 40:27.926
Kyle, get me out!

40:29.418 --> 40:31.001
Get me out of here!

40:33.820 --> 40:35.403
Okay, okay, Jena...

40:43.875 --> 40:44.708
Ew!

40:46.180 --> 40:48.060
Anyone out there?

40:48.060 --> 40:49.330
Please!

40:49.330 --> 40:51.150
Please, help me!

40:51.150 --> 40:53.489
Please get me out of here!

40:53.489 --> 40:55.060
I don't want to...

40:55.060 --> 40:55.893
Help!

40:56.868 --> 40:57.701
Help!

40:59.206 --> 41:00.428
Please.

41:00.428 --> 41:02.447
(banging)

41:02.447 --> 41:05.289
Please get me out of here!

41:05.289 --> 41:08.122
Kyle, I don't want to die, please!

41:09.628 --> 41:11.008
Please!

41:11.008 --> 41:13.591
(Jena sobbing)

41:16.576 --> 41:18.256
- [Justin] Erica!

41:18.256 --> 41:19.089
Erica!

41:21.576 --> 41:22.409
Erica!

41:23.557 --> 41:26.224
(ominous music)

41:35.110 --> 41:37.777
(intense music)

41:43.717 --> 41:45.950
- Where are Chris and Nicole?

41:45.950 --> 41:47.890
- They were behind us when we ran for you.

41:47.890 --> 41:49.433
We need to call the police.

41:53.290 --> 41:54.760
No service.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.980
How about you?

41:55.980 --> 41:57.630
- No, I'm not getting anything.

41:57.630 --> 42:00.710
- Well, maybe an emergency
call will go through.

42:00.710 --> 42:02.831
- What the hell is going on?

42:02.831 --> 42:04.081
- I don't know!

42:05.003 --> 42:06.263
I still got nothing.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.030
- I don't know if we're
gonna be able to make a call.

42:09.030 --> 42:10.060
- [Alexis] We have to!

42:10.060 --> 42:12.060
- Guys, we gotta get outta here.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.010
Erica's dead.

42:13.010 --> 42:13.843
- [Alexis] What?

42:13.843 --> 42:14.676
- [Kyle] How?

42:14.676 --> 42:16.820
- I don't know, there's blood everywhere.

42:16.820 --> 42:17.653
We need to go.

42:17.653 --> 42:19.660
- Dude, she could still be
walking around somewhere!

42:19.660 --> 42:21.600
- You didn't see what I saw.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.953
- Well, what do we do?

42:24.130 --> 42:25.510
What was that?

42:25.510 --> 42:26.580
- It sounds like Jena.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.053
- We need to leave, I
got the keys, let's go!

42:28.053 --> 42:30.520
- Jena could still be
alive, and Erica too!

42:30.520 --> 42:33.253
- Guys, shut up, where is it coming from?

42:34.210 --> 42:35.530
Over here?

42:35.530 --> 42:38.093
- Sounds like she's under us.

42:39.283 --> 42:40.402
- Jena!

42:40.402 --> 42:42.235
- Maybe she's in here?

42:44.283 --> 42:47.335
(eerie music)

42:47.335 --> 42:49.002
- Jena, is that you?

42:52.874 --> 42:55.374
(door creaks)

42:58.384 --> 43:00.030
Jena?

43:00.030 --> 43:01.374
- [Justin] She's still alive.

43:01.374 --> 43:02.494
- [Kyle] Jena, is that you?

43:02.494 --> 43:03.327
- Jena?

43:05.430 --> 43:07.144
- We need to find a way to get to her.

43:07.144 --> 43:08.060
- Well, we can't go outside,

43:08.060 --> 43:09.360
that thing is out there!

43:09.360 --> 43:10.193
- It could be in here too.

43:10.193 --> 43:11.540
- What do you mean?

43:11.540 --> 43:13.423
- That thing took Jena and Erica.

43:15.018 --> 43:19.203
(eerie music)
- What was that?

43:19.203 --> 43:24.058
(whispering)
(eerie music)

43:24.058 --> 43:24.891
- Looks like a person.

43:24.891 --> 43:27.124
- We need to leave.

43:27.124 --> 43:27.957
- It has Jena!

43:27.957 --> 43:29.653
- I think it has Chris and Nicole too.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.007
Where'd it go?

43:32.007 --> 43:34.412
- We need to go out there and fight it.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.240
- That's definitely not a good idea.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.790
- Maybe we could just stay in the house

43:37.790 --> 43:38.623
until someone comes for us.

43:38.623 --> 43:40.640
- Who the hell is gonna find us out here?

43:40.640 --> 43:42.090
We're in the middle of nowhere!

43:42.090 --> 43:43.563
- We can't go outside.

43:44.740 --> 43:46.410
- Well, maybe we should go
through the basement then.

43:46.410 --> 43:48.040
- What if it's down there?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.780
- We need to run to the car!

43:49.780 --> 43:52.530
- We find Jena, then we leave!

43:52.530 --> 43:54.490
- Without Chris and Nicole?

43:54.490 --> 43:56.090
- They shouldn't of wandered off!

43:56.090 --> 43:57.170
- Are you serious?

43:57.170 --> 43:58.450
- You want that on your conscience?

43:58.450 --> 43:59.550
They could still be alive.

43:59.550 --> 44:01.750
- We need to at least
try and look for them!

44:04.000 --> 44:04.950
What are you doing?

44:07.210 --> 44:09.360
- There, I looked.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.490
Now let's find something that we can use.

44:11.490 --> 44:12.340
- Use for what?

44:12.340 --> 44:14.950
- To protect ourselves!

44:14.950 --> 44:16.293
Start looking, come on.

44:21.171 --> 44:22.004
- Kyle?

44:23.675 --> 44:24.903
I can't breathe.

44:24.903 --> 44:25.736
Kyle!

44:27.463 --> 44:29.903
Get out me out of here.

44:29.903 --> 44:30.820
Get me out.

44:32.490 --> 44:36.240
(sobbing)
Get me out of here!

44:41.675 --> 44:43.050
- I can't find anything!

44:43.050 --> 44:44.390
- Keep looking!

44:44.390 --> 44:46.140
There's gotta be something in here.

44:47.960 --> 44:48.793
- This'll work.

44:51.020 --> 44:51.853
- Did you find...

44:51.853 --> 44:52.720
Okay, good.

44:52.720 --> 44:53.553
- Yeah, I got it.

44:53.553 --> 44:54.386
- This will be perfect.

44:54.386 --> 44:55.270
- Let me get the bat!

44:55.270 --> 44:56.340
- Are you serious?

44:56.340 --> 44:57.278
Find something else!

44:57.278 --> 44:58.190
- Guys-
- There's nothing else!

44:58.190 --> 44:59.790
- Come on!
- Take the damn bat!

45:03.329 --> 45:05.027
There was nothing else, huh?

45:05.027 --> 45:05.860
- Go.
- Go.

45:05.860 --> 45:06.893
- Stay close.

45:17.370 --> 45:18.310
Come on, shh!

45:21.377 --> 45:22.238
- Doesn't look good.

45:22.238 --> 45:23.467
- Be quiet!

45:23.467 --> 45:24.550
Just come on.

45:34.747 --> 45:35.837
(beeping)

45:35.837 --> 45:36.837
- Go, go, go

45:39.514 --> 45:44.264
(banging)
(Jena sobbing)

45:56.386 --> 45:58.136
- Get me out, please!

46:01.326 --> 46:03.909
(Jena sobbing)

46:13.589 --> 46:14.422
Please!

46:20.724 --> 46:22.391
- [Kyle] Stay close.

46:24.417 --> 46:26.523
- [Alexis] I'm getting a
really bad feeling about this.

46:28.009 --> 46:30.509
(eerie music)

46:33.670 --> 46:35.950
- I'm hearing those noises
I heard from the creek.

46:35.950 --> 46:37.074
- Same ones?

46:37.074 --> 46:38.574
- Yeah, some ones.

46:41.100 --> 46:43.100
Everything will be fine, just watch out.

46:46.761 --> 46:48.222
You hear that?

46:48.222 --> 46:50.053
- Sounds like it came from over there.

46:50.053 --> 46:50.886
- [Kyle] Jena.

46:50.886 --> 46:52.053
- Jena?
- Jena!

46:54.813 --> 46:55.646
- [Alexis] Jena?

46:55.646 --> 46:56.479
- Jena, where are you?

46:56.479 --> 46:58.282
Jena!
- There, there, there!

46:58.282 --> 46:59.115
- Jena!

46:59.115 --> 46:59.948
- [Alexis] Jena!

46:59.948 --> 47:00.781
- You're there!

47:00.781 --> 47:02.114
- [Jena] Get me out of here!

47:02.114 --> 47:03.158
- [Alexis] Try this, try this!

47:03.158 --> 47:05.000
- [Kyle] Here, we're gonna
try to open the door.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.787
- [Alexis] What about something up here?

47:08.787 --> 47:10.148
(groaning)

47:10.148 --> 47:10.981
- [Kyle] Nothing's working!

47:10.981 --> 47:12.660
Here, let me...

47:12.660 --> 47:14.456
(banging)
- Kyle!

47:14.456 --> 47:15.373
Get me out!

47:16.562 --> 47:18.101
Kyle, get me out!

47:18.101 --> 47:19.850
- [Kyle] Nothing's working,
I need something else!

47:19.850 --> 47:20.850
We're gonna get you out of there, babe.

47:20.850 --> 47:21.690
- [Alexis] Try this, try this.

47:21.690 --> 47:23.857
- [Kyle] Here, let me see.

47:26.181 --> 47:28.200
Nothing's working!

47:28.200 --> 47:30.040
- [Alexis] Get it open!

47:30.040 --> 47:31.552
- [Kyle] Jena!

47:31.552 --> 47:33.200
- [Jena] Kyle!

47:33.200 --> 47:35.461
(banging)

47:35.461 --> 47:37.061
- [Kyle] Jena, come on!

47:37.061 --> 47:39.311
(grunting)

47:43.291 --> 47:45.060
- Get me out of here!

47:45.060 --> 47:46.310
- Are you okay?

47:47.962 --> 47:49.462
Are you all right?

47:51.454 --> 47:53.459
- [Jena] It's cold.

47:53.459 --> 47:55.840
- Do you have any cuts, are you bleeding?

47:55.840 --> 48:00.140
- [Jena] No, I'm just scared and I'm cold.

48:00.140 --> 48:01.043
Get me out, please.

48:01.043 --> 48:02.030
- I know, I know, I know.

48:02.030 --> 48:02.863
I love you, baby.

48:02.863 --> 48:04.764
- [Jena] I love you too.

48:04.764 --> 48:06.111
I hear something, there's something here!

48:06.111 --> 48:08.596
- [Kyle] Keep looking!

48:08.596 --> 48:09.429
It's gonna be all right, baby.

48:09.429 --> 48:11.364
Alexis, do you see anything?

48:11.364 --> 48:12.197
Anything?

48:12.197 --> 48:14.243
- [Alexis] There's nothing,
like nothing's working.

48:16.054 --> 48:17.804
- Kyle, do you hear that?

48:17.804 --> 48:20.338
- [Kyle] Hear what,
what is it, what is it?

48:20.338 --> 48:21.171
What is it?

48:21.171 --> 48:22.132
What does it sound like?

48:22.132 --> 48:23.823
- I don't know.

48:23.823 --> 48:24.656
- [Kyle] Is it an animal, is it a person?

48:24.656 --> 48:26.473
- Please, get me out!

48:28.555 --> 48:29.844
- Just try to relax,

48:29.844 --> 48:32.244
we're gonna get you out
of there, I promise.

48:32.244 --> 48:34.175
(sobbing)

48:34.175 --> 48:35.415
We're gonna get you out
of there, I promise,

48:35.415 --> 48:36.561
just relax.

48:36.561 --> 48:38.252
(Jena sobbing)

48:38.252 --> 48:40.080
It's gonna be all right.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.412
- There's nothing!

48:41.412 --> 48:43.551
- [Kyle] Keep looking!

48:43.551 --> 48:44.551
- All right.

48:46.795 --> 48:47.641
- [Kyle] I love you, sweetie,

48:47.641 --> 48:49.303
everything will be okay.

48:49.303 --> 48:51.351
Just calm down.

48:51.351 --> 48:55.934
That's it, breathe, everything
will be fine, I promise.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.403
We have to open the door!

49:02.092 --> 49:03.423
Are you okay?

49:03.423 --> 49:05.923
(eerie music)

49:10.680 --> 49:12.494
Are you guys finding anything?

49:12.494 --> 49:14.758
(Jena sobbing)

49:14.758 --> 49:17.425
(ominous music)

49:31.428 --> 49:34.178
(Jena screaming)

49:50.027 --> 49:52.860
(heavy breathing)

49:54.814 --> 49:57.731
(doorknob turning)

50:13.439 --> 50:14.420
(door creaks)

50:14.420 --> 50:16.605
- [Alexis] Guys, do you see that?

50:16.605 --> 50:20.094
- [Justin] Guys, we should leave.

50:20.094 --> 50:21.261
- [Kyle] Jena?

50:31.793 --> 50:33.190
- Guys...

50:33.190 --> 50:34.523
We should leave.

50:39.001 --> 50:41.678
(eerie music)
(growling)

50:41.678 --> 50:43.049
(yelling)

50:43.049 --> 50:44.209
- [Kyle] Justin!

50:44.209 --> 50:45.042
Justin!

50:46.238 --> 50:47.071
Justin!

50:47.071 --> 50:48.046
- [Alexis] Justin!

50:48.046 --> 50:50.213
(banging)

50:51.787 --> 50:55.157
(doorknob turning)

50:55.157 --> 50:57.657
(eerie music)

51:03.685 --> 51:06.185
(door creaks)

51:11.238 --> 51:12.405
- We gotta go.

51:13.667 --> 51:15.167
Kyle, we gotta go!

51:16.878 --> 51:19.545
(ominous music)

51:28.023 --> 51:30.060
- What do we do?

51:30.060 --> 51:31.240
- The guest house?

51:31.240 --> 51:32.660
- I think I see somebody.

51:32.660 --> 51:34.196
- [Alexis] Well, maybe
it's one of the others.

51:34.196 --> 51:35.765
- All right, well, let's
go, come on, come on.

51:35.765 --> 51:36.598
- [Alexis] Merlin!

51:36.598 --> 51:39.207
- [Kyle] Chris, Nicole!

51:39.207 --> 51:41.095
- The lights are on over here!

51:41.095 --> 51:42.175
Merlin!

51:42.175 --> 51:43.008
Help!

51:43.008 --> 51:45.316
- Guys, open the door!
- Help, let us in!

51:45.316 --> 51:46.473
- Come on!

51:46.473 --> 51:48.196
- I think I hear something!

51:48.196 --> 51:50.036
- Help!
- Help!

51:50.036 --> 51:51.619
- Let us in!
- Guys!

51:54.102 --> 51:55.287
- What do we do now?

51:55.287 --> 51:56.537
- I don't know!

52:01.717 --> 52:03.330
The power's back on.

52:03.330 --> 52:04.760
- Well, we can't go back in there.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.103
- We need the keys!

52:07.370 --> 52:09.218
- Chris and Nicole had
a set in their room!

52:09.218 --> 52:10.051
- All right, let's go, come on!

52:10.051 --> 52:11.640
- No, no, no, I can't go back in there!

52:11.640 --> 52:13.880
- Well, we can't stay out here!

52:13.880 --> 52:15.940
- Merlin's in there, I heard somebody!

52:15.940 --> 52:17.570
He has to help us.

52:17.570 --> 52:19.650
- Well, then why isn't
he answering the door?

52:19.650 --> 52:23.160
What if it's a trap from
that thing in there?

52:23.160 --> 52:25.580
- I don't know what to do anymore!

52:25.580 --> 52:27.223
I just want to go home!

52:28.350 --> 52:30.710
- Here, let's try like
breaking the glass to get in.

52:30.710 --> 52:31.543
Come on!

52:32.430 --> 52:34.223
- You just said it could be a trap.

52:43.750 --> 52:45.319
- We're stuck.

52:45.319 --> 52:46.152
- I know.

52:47.970 --> 52:49.460
- That's your best friend out there.

52:49.460 --> 52:50.740
We have to open the door.

52:50.740 --> 52:53.020
- We can't risk it.

52:53.020 --> 52:54.290
- He's right.

52:54.290 --> 52:56.350
They could tell people about the house!

52:56.350 --> 52:58.940
- Or maybe they won't.

52:58.940 --> 53:00.600
- [Nicole] We don't know that.

53:00.600 --> 53:01.930
- [Chris] What are you thinking?

53:01.930 --> 53:03.650
- I don't want to open the door for them.

53:03.650 --> 53:06.113
- Well, what other options do we have?

53:08.050 --> 53:09.963
- The lights in the house are back on.

53:13.780 --> 53:15.480
- It's done feeding for the night.

53:17.610 --> 53:20.203
- Well, what's the plan?

53:23.130 --> 53:24.243
- I know what to do.

53:27.330 --> 53:28.493
- I wish we never came.

53:30.310 --> 53:31.370
- Wait.

53:31.370 --> 53:33.110
Why were we safe earlier?

53:33.110 --> 53:34.830
- We were never safe.

53:34.830 --> 53:35.870
- Yes, we were.

53:35.870 --> 53:37.803
Nothing happened for hours.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.170
- What are you getting at?

53:40.170 --> 53:41.520
- Well, whatever that thing was,

53:41.520 --> 53:43.430
it only came out at night.

53:43.430 --> 53:44.780
- We don't know that.

53:44.780 --> 53:46.103
- But I could be right.

53:47.480 --> 53:49.470
- Okay, say you're right.

53:49.470 --> 53:50.483
Now what do we do?

53:51.860 --> 53:54.600
- Well, it's almost morning.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.160
So we find a place to hide,

53:56.160 --> 53:57.910
we get the keys when it's daylight.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.060
- Okay, I don't know
if this is gonna work,

54:02.060 --> 54:03.860
but it's better than anything I got.

54:05.100 --> 54:06.442
- Where do we go?

54:06.442 --> 54:07.275
- I don't know.

54:11.891 --> 54:12.910
- [Nicole] Kyle, Alexis?

54:12.910 --> 54:13.930
- Nicole?

54:13.930 --> 54:15.060
- Where are the others?

54:15.060 --> 54:16.980
- They're gone, they're dead!

54:16.980 --> 54:18.560
- There's blood everywhere!

54:18.560 --> 54:19.820
- What do you mean blood?

54:19.820 --> 54:22.380
- We don't know what, but
something killed them.

54:22.380 --> 54:24.000
I think it only hunts at night.

54:24.000 --> 54:24.980
- [Kyle] You have to let us in there,

54:24.980 --> 54:26.280
we can't stay out here.

54:26.280 --> 54:28.683
- [Nicole] The door won't
open, you have to help me.

54:31.863 --> 54:33.196
- [Alexis] Kyle?

54:39.490 --> 54:40.399
- Do you have the zip tie?

54:40.399 --> 54:41.959
- Yeah.

54:41.959 --> 54:42.792
Here.

54:42.792 --> 54:43.792
There's one.

55:10.621 --> 55:13.288
(ominous music)

55:29.777 --> 55:31.327
- [Nicole] Here's your syringe.

55:35.071 --> 55:37.738
(ominous music)

56:38.390 --> 56:39.740
- [Chris] Yeah, she's good.

56:41.240 --> 56:42.860
- [Nicole] Grandpa, do
you have the duct tape?

56:42.860 --> 56:43.860
- Got it right here.

56:56.917 --> 56:58.167
Mm, you know...

56:59.640 --> 57:01.533
They seem like real nice kids.

57:03.108 --> 57:04.100
(Nicole sighs)

57:04.100 --> 57:05.863
- Yeah, I guess so.

57:08.908 --> 57:10.390
- [Merlin] There.

57:10.390 --> 57:11.470
Now this big guy.

57:15.719 --> 57:17.469
Here you go, big boy.

57:19.148 --> 57:20.060
There.

57:20.060 --> 57:20.893
How's that?

57:22.136 --> 57:24.030
That should do it.

57:24.030 --> 57:24.980
- [Nicole] Thanks, Grandpa.

57:24.980 --> 57:26.508
- [Merlin] Thank you, Nicole.

57:26.508 --> 57:28.841
- All right, let's go, babe.

57:49.050 --> 57:50.550
- What a day, huh?

57:52.199 --> 57:53.528
- [Chris] Yeah.

57:53.528 --> 57:55.497
- I'll see you two in the morning.

57:55.497 --> 57:57.150
I love you both.

57:57.150 --> 57:58.610
- Love you, Grandpa.

57:58.610 --> 58:00.190
- [Chris] Goodnight.

58:00.190 --> 58:02.340
- You two did good today.

58:02.340 --> 58:03.173
- Thanks.

58:04.021 --> 58:05.021
- Goodnight.

58:08.639 --> 58:11.222
(birds cawing)

58:35.836 --> 58:38.503
(water running)

58:51.827 --> 58:54.660
(muffled talking)

59:06.417 --> 59:08.667
(grunting)

59:33.337 --> 59:36.170
(muffled yelling)

59:45.200 --> 59:47.083
That was a long night last night.

59:48.620 --> 59:49.483
- Yeah.

59:53.670 --> 59:54.670
- [Merlin] How many?

59:56.500 --> 59:57.733
- One for me, please.

59:58.690 --> 59:59.523
- Two is fine.

1:00:02.540 --> 1:00:05.263
- [Merlin] Your grandmother
used to love these things.

1:00:07.690 --> 1:00:08.523
- What's wrong?

1:00:10.950 --> 1:00:11.783
- Nothing.

1:00:13.290 --> 1:00:14.660
Why?

1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:16.270
- You're acting weird.

1:00:16.270 --> 1:00:17.233
Aren't you happy?

1:00:20.195 --> 1:00:21.050
- Yeah, yeah.

1:00:21.050 --> 1:00:22.433
Just tired.

1:00:24.244 --> 1:00:26.090
- Why don't you go take a nap?

1:00:26.090 --> 1:00:28.363
I'll take care of Kyle and Alexis.

1:00:31.020 --> 1:00:33.520
- We don't know when that
thing's gonna eat again.

1:00:35.130 --> 1:00:36.063
- Yeah, so?

1:00:37.061 --> 1:00:38.050
We just wait.

1:00:38.050 --> 1:00:39.363
- I can go down there.

1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:41.540
- No, Grandpa.

1:00:41.540 --> 1:00:42.403
I'll handle it.

1:00:47.270 --> 1:00:48.103
- For you.

1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:49.813
- Thanks.

1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:00.923
Grandpa, have you seen this?

1:01:02.750 --> 1:01:03.583
- Yeah.

1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:05.410
- What is it?

1:01:05.410 --> 1:01:07.020
- Our ticket out.

1:01:07.020 --> 1:01:09.140
- I will not have that on my conscience.

1:01:09.140 --> 1:01:12.540
- But you're okay with
collecting people for feeding?

1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:14.353
- What do you suppose will happen?

1:01:15.410 --> 1:01:18.743
We sell the place, run away,

1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:21.653
and leave your grandmother here?

1:01:22.930 --> 1:01:24.853
- That's not her anymore.

1:01:26.140 --> 1:01:28.800
- I know she's not the same,

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:31.133
but I can't leave her.

1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:33.883
We know how to deal with her.

1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:39.140
We just need to find a
way to free her soul.

1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:41.660
- We can't tell anybody about this.

1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:43.410
How are we supposed to do that?

1:01:43.410 --> 1:01:46.693
- We just need time to figure it out.

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:49.530
I don't want to do this forever either.

1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:56.343
- Maybe we should just
look at our options.

1:01:57.433 --> 1:02:00.913
You know, we can look at
these investor people.

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:04.213
- I will not sell.

1:02:08.423 --> 1:02:10.420
- We can't do this forever.

1:02:10.420 --> 1:02:11.253
- We won't.

1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:22.733
Your parents would've
been so proud of you.

1:02:25.300 --> 1:02:27.823
- My parents would've fixed this.

1:02:29.432 --> 1:02:32.550
- We can only do our best.

1:02:32.550 --> 1:02:33.813
Eat your breakfast.

1:02:38.410 --> 1:02:39.710
- I'm gonna go downstairs.

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:42.150
- I'll go with you.

1:02:43.030 --> 1:02:44.853
Grandpa, you should get some rest.

1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:48.190
- I can go alone.

1:02:48.190 --> 1:02:49.163
- I'm going too.

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.700
- I'll just clean this stuff
up and then I'll do that.

1:02:54.835 --> 1:02:57.085
(grunting)

1:03:16.123 --> 1:03:18.706
(sink running)

1:03:31.164 --> 1:03:33.831
(ominous music)

1:04:33.023 --> 1:04:35.606
(glass spills)

1:04:44.143 --> 1:04:45.470
Nicole!

1:04:45.470 --> 1:04:46.840
- I'll be right there, Grandpa.

1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:48.150
Are you okay?

1:04:48.150 --> 1:04:49.470
- [Merlin] I'm okay.

1:04:49.470 --> 1:04:52.030
- Just go back upstairs, I got this.

1:04:52.030 --> 1:04:53.530
- You obviously don't.

1:04:53.530 --> 1:04:56.030
Next time, don't even come.

1:04:56.030 --> 1:04:58.060
- That's exactly it.

1:04:58.060 --> 1:04:59.340
- Then go back upstairs.

1:04:59.340 --> 1:05:01.253
I told you, I've got this.

1:05:02.252 --> 1:05:03.890
- You know, I was gonna
wait 'til we got home.

1:05:03.890 --> 1:05:05.040
I'll tell you this now.

1:05:06.630 --> 1:05:08.170
Sit down.

1:05:08.170 --> 1:05:09.680
- What are you talking about?

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:10.533
What's going on?

1:05:12.850 --> 1:05:15.100
- I can't do this anymore.

1:05:15.100 --> 1:05:17.200
- Okay, that's fine.

1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:19.210
This will be the last time.

1:05:19.210 --> 1:05:20.743
We'll get my grandpa to sell.

1:05:21.690 --> 1:05:22.603
- It's too late.

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:25.840
This has ruined our relationship.

1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:27.923
I don't even know who you are anymore!

1:05:31.050 --> 1:05:32.550
- Are you breaking up with me?

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:36.553
- Sorry.

1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:57.670
- You're not gonna tell
anyone about this, are you?

1:05:59.677 --> 1:06:00.510
- Of course not.

1:06:02.075 --> 1:06:03.175
I would never do that.

1:06:04.870 --> 1:06:06.420
- Is this really what you want?

1:06:08.670 --> 1:06:09.523
- Yes.

1:06:12.250 --> 1:06:13.980
- I need to go check on my grandpa.

1:06:13.980 --> 1:06:14.813
Wait here.

1:06:15.734 --> 1:06:16.567
- Okay.

1:06:30.550 --> 1:06:33.593
- Grandpa, what happened?

1:06:33.593 --> 1:06:37.103
- I was washing the
dishes, and I saw blood!

1:06:39.380 --> 1:06:41.400
- Grandpa, we're fine.

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:42.410
Nothing's there.

1:06:42.410 --> 1:06:43.763
You just need some sleep.

1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:48.133
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

1:06:51.730 --> 1:06:52.563
Here.

1:06:54.072 --> 1:06:56.030
Can you wake me in a couple of hours?

1:06:56.030 --> 1:06:56.863
- Yes.

1:06:58.250 --> 1:06:59.083
- Okay.

1:06:59.083 --> 1:06:59.916
- Just get to bed.

1:07:00.820 --> 1:07:01.653
- Okay.

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:05.620
What do you need that for?

1:07:07.243 --> 1:07:09.060
- Just get some rest.

1:07:09.060 --> 1:07:10.610
I'll come get you before night.

1:07:15.371 --> 1:07:17.871
(eerie music)

1:07:29.430 --> 1:07:30.263
Come on.

1:07:31.557 --> 1:07:34.057
(tense music)

1:07:39.438 --> 1:07:40.271
- Let's make this quick.

1:07:40.271 --> 1:07:42.253
- Yeah, I'm tired of this too.

1:07:45.933 --> 1:07:47.110
- You ready?

1:07:47.110 --> 1:07:47.943
- Ready.

1:07:50.512 --> 1:07:52.340
(grunting)

1:07:52.340 --> 1:07:53.173
- Here we go.

1:07:58.210 --> 1:08:00.472
- I told you not to come, Alexis.

1:08:00.472 --> 1:08:01.443
And what do you do?

1:08:01.443 --> 1:08:03.140
You come anyway.

1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:05.163
You brought this upon yourself.

1:08:05.163 --> 1:08:07.413
(grunting)

1:08:09.582 --> 1:08:10.627
- Fuck you!

1:08:10.627 --> 1:08:12.050
You planned this the whole time?

1:08:12.050 --> 1:08:13.251
You sick bastards!

1:08:13.251 --> 1:08:14.084
- Let us go!

1:08:14.084 --> 1:08:16.389
- You're gonna get yours.

1:08:16.389 --> 1:08:18.020
- Nicole, how can you
even live with yourself?

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:20.340
You know my parents will come for me!

1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:22.800
- Don't worry, we have a plan for that.

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:24.760
- [Chris] Now, I suggest you eat that.

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:26.500
(Kyle spits)

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:28.770
- What's the point in feeding us?

1:08:28.770 --> 1:08:30.360
- We're their bait.

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:31.350
- Good job.

1:08:31.350 --> 1:08:32.450
You figured it out.

1:08:32.450 --> 1:08:34.622
Just like you do everything else.

1:08:36.490 --> 1:08:37.933
- [Chris] All right, let's go.

1:08:39.076 --> 1:08:41.149
- Let us the hell out of here!

1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:45.660
Don't eat that, you don't
know what's in there.

1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:47.410
- You're gonna hurt yourself, stop.

1:08:50.059 --> 1:08:51.553
- [Kyle] We're gonna die in here.

1:08:52.870 --> 1:08:54.229
- No, wait.

1:08:54.229 --> 1:08:55.063
I have an idea.

1:08:58.425 --> 1:08:59.259
- [Kyle] What are you doing?

1:08:59.259 --> 1:09:00.270
- Hold on, wait a second.

1:09:06.430 --> 1:09:07.874
I can't believe that worked.

1:09:07.874 --> 1:09:09.020
- How did you do that?

1:09:09.020 --> 1:09:10.210
- Online survival tips.

1:09:10.210 --> 1:09:11.050
- [Kyle] Here, come on.

1:09:11.050 --> 1:09:11.883
Show me, show me how to do this.

1:09:11.883 --> 1:09:13.690
- Okay, lay down straight.

1:09:13.690 --> 1:09:15.479
And lift your arms over your head,

1:09:15.479 --> 1:09:17.235
and then you're gonna slam
them against your thighs.

1:09:17.235 --> 1:09:18.068
- Okay, all right.

1:09:18.068 --> 1:09:19.224
- [Alexis] Okay, go.

1:09:19.224 --> 1:09:20.469
(groaning)

1:09:20.469 --> 1:09:21.530
Okay, okay, let me help, let me help.

1:09:21.530 --> 1:09:22.362
- Okay, come on, come on,

1:09:22.362 --> 1:09:23.196
we don't know when they're coming back.

1:09:23.196 --> 1:09:24.029
- Okay, okay.

1:09:26.261 --> 1:09:27.819
Got it, got it, got it.

1:09:27.819 --> 1:09:28.670
- Oh, wait, wait.

1:09:31.842 --> 1:09:32.729
On our way out.

1:09:32.729 --> 1:09:34.130
- [Alexis] Justin's keys.

1:09:34.130 --> 1:09:36.773
But we can't leave, they'll see us go.

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:39.990
- I have a better idea.

1:09:40.950 --> 1:09:43.700
(dramatic music)

1:09:50.145 --> 1:09:51.139
- Well, what's wrong?

1:09:51.139 --> 1:09:53.370
- Nothing, I'm surprised
to see you, is all.

1:09:53.370 --> 1:09:55.059
- I thought you would want me to come.

1:09:55.059 --> 1:09:57.520
- I do, I just wasn't expecting it.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:59.923
I just, I don't know,

1:09:59.923 --> 1:10:01.889
just so much stuff
going on with my family,

1:10:01.889 --> 1:10:03.633
and it's really taking a toll.

1:10:10.370 --> 1:10:11.320
- I'm out, I'm out.

1:10:15.004 --> 1:10:15.837
- You all right?

1:10:15.837 --> 1:10:16.670
- Yeah, yeah.

1:10:16.670 --> 1:10:18.920
- Let's focus now, come on.

1:10:24.625 --> 1:10:26.930
- How about this?

1:10:26.930 --> 1:10:28.680
Can hit someone with.

1:10:31.350 --> 1:10:32.459
- We'll make do with what we got.

1:10:32.459 --> 1:10:33.841
- Yeah.

1:10:33.841 --> 1:10:34.681
I got this.

1:10:34.681 --> 1:10:35.764
- Okay, cool.

1:10:44.262 --> 1:10:46.844
(birds cawing)

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:02.353
- [Chris] Hey.

1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:04.952
- Hey.

1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:08.677
- What you doin'?

1:11:12.273 --> 1:11:14.873
- Just trying to figure out
a way to end this thing.

1:11:16.370 --> 1:11:17.320
- [Chris] Any luck?

1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:19.223
- [Nicole] Nope.

1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:23.500
- What'd you find?

1:11:27.230 --> 1:11:29.053
- Just a bunch of Wiccan stuff.

1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:42.713
Did you pack?

1:11:46.110 --> 1:11:46.943
- Not yet.

1:11:50.608 --> 1:11:52.213
Didn't want to wake your grandpa.

1:12:00.570 --> 1:12:01.770
I'm sorry about earlier.

1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:05.430
- I don't want to talk
about it, it's done.

1:12:13.447 --> 1:12:16.197
- I think we should go back down.

1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:19.433
- Okay.

1:12:26.648 --> 1:12:29.148
(eerie music)

1:12:48.550 --> 1:12:51.790
- You know...

1:12:51.790 --> 1:12:52.940
We do make a good team.

1:12:55.340 --> 1:12:56.183
- I don't know.

1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:00.143
- Maybe we could work it out.

1:13:01.010 --> 1:13:02.309
- Are you serious?

1:13:02.309 --> 1:13:03.153
Just go!

1:13:04.041 --> 1:13:04.874
- Okay.

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:11.550
(tense music)
(groaning)

1:13:13.137 --> 1:13:13.969
- [Alexis] Got it, I got it.

1:13:13.969 --> 1:13:15.803
- Here, get his hands.

1:13:18.068 --> 1:13:18.901
- Chris?

1:13:20.956 --> 1:13:21.789
Oh my God!

1:13:21.789 --> 1:13:23.137
- [Kyle] Oh shit, come on!

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:24.055
- Get off of me!

1:13:24.055 --> 1:13:24.963
- [Alexis] Get her, get her, get her.

1:13:24.963 --> 1:13:25.796
- I got her!

1:13:25.796 --> 1:13:27.270
Here.

1:13:27.270 --> 1:13:29.830
- Leave me alone, get off!

1:13:29.830 --> 1:13:31.190
Chris, wake up!

1:13:31.190 --> 1:13:32.023
- Get down.

1:13:32.023 --> 1:13:33.166
- Get her down, get her down.

1:13:33.166 --> 1:13:34.179
Here, I got her legs.

1:13:34.179 --> 1:13:35.076
- Okay.

1:13:35.076 --> 1:13:36.190
- Get off of me!

1:13:36.190 --> 1:13:37.023
What are you doing?

1:13:37.023 --> 1:13:38.001
Get off!

1:13:38.001 --> 1:13:39.501
Alexis, let me go!

1:13:40.452 --> 1:13:41.420
- All right, you good?

1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:42.253
Good?

1:13:42.253 --> 1:13:43.085
- [Alexis] Go.

1:13:43.085 --> 1:13:43.919
We gotta get out.

1:13:43.919 --> 1:13:45.098
- [Nicole] You can't
leave me here, Alexis!

1:13:45.098 --> 1:13:46.014
No, please!

1:13:47.001 --> 1:13:49.262
- You brought this on yourself.

1:13:49.262 --> 1:13:50.857
- [Nicole] Alexis!

1:13:50.857 --> 1:13:52.184
- Come on, come on!
- Go, go, go!

1:13:52.184 --> 1:13:53.446
- I'm going, come on!

1:13:53.446 --> 1:13:56.446
(suspenseful music)

1:14:00.023 --> 1:14:01.322
(engine revs)
- Go, go!

1:14:01.322 --> 1:14:04.322
- [Kyle] I'm going as fast as I can.

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:09.397
(tires screeching)

1:14:23.659 --> 1:14:26.209
- Chris, Chris, wake up!

1:14:26.209 --> 1:14:27.838
Chris!

1:14:27.838 --> 1:14:28.671

1:14:29.587 --> 1:14:31.420
Anybody, help, please!

1:14:51.044 --> 1:14:51.878
Chris.

1:14:51.878 --> 1:14:52.960
Alexis, help!

1:15:20.457 --> 1:15:21.290
- Nicole?

1:15:30.956 --> 1:15:31.789
Nicole?

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:37.340
(eerie music)

1:16:29.717 --> 1:16:32.550
(heavy breathing)

1:16:42.496 --> 1:16:44.996
(door creaks)

1:16:49.261 --> 1:16:52.407
(intense music)

1:16:52.407 --> 1:16:54.741
(screaming)

1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:07.870
- [Woman] We should've come here sooner.

1:17:07.870 --> 1:17:09.969
- [Woman] I told you the place was booked.

1:17:09.969 --> 1:17:12.170
- I don't think two
days is gonna be enough.

1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:17.730
- When we meet Merlin, don't
say anything about Olivia.

1:17:22.507 --> 1:17:25.007
(door creaks)

1:17:27.860 --> 1:17:28.693
Hello?

1:17:30.670 --> 1:17:31.503
Hello?

1:17:35.165 --> 1:17:36.620
- I don't think we should go in there.

1:17:36.620 --> 1:17:38.559
- You didn't hear that?

1:17:38.559 --> 1:17:39.670
- No.

1:17:39.670 --> 1:17:41.000
- I definitely heard something,

1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.202
it might be your sister.

1:17:43.969 --> 1:17:45.300
- Or renters.

1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:46.950
- Do you want to find her or not?

1:17:59.190 --> 1:18:00.023
Hello?

1:18:03.830 --> 1:18:05.223
Is anyone home?

1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:10.273
- Hello?

1:18:11.889 --> 1:18:12.723
- Merlin?

1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:19.523
I'm just gonna go check it out, stay here.

1:18:42.592 --> 1:18:45.342
(water dripping)

1:18:48.370 --> 1:18:50.870
(eerie music)

1:19:10.773 --> 1:19:13.691
(mysterious music)

1:20:05.212 --> 1:20:10.129
(whispering)
(door creaks)

1:20:14.684 --> 1:20:17.351
(ominous music)

1:20:23.715 --> 1:20:25.555
Casey?

1:20:25.555 --> 1:20:30.433
Casey?

1:20:30.433 --> 1:20:33.282
Casey, where are you?

1:20:33.282 --> 1:20:35.949
(ominous music)

1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:51.083
Casey, Casey!

1:20:54.170 --> 1:20:56.003
Casey, Casey!

1:20:57.380 --> 1:20:58.452
Let's go!

1:21:01.250 --> 1:21:06.250
(ominous music)
(creature squawking)

1:21:07.572 --> 1:21:10.322
(dramatic music)

1:22:43.492 --> 1:22:45.992
(tense music)

1:24:28.270 --> 1:24:29.280
- Hey.

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:30.480
- [Alexis] Hey.

1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:31.553
- Did you find anything?

1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:37.389
- I think I found the
link between the murders.

1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:41.323
- You know that means we need to go back.

1:24:43.090 --> 1:24:43.923
- Yeah.
