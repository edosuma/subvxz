WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.044
Previously

00:02.085 --> 00:03.044
on  Malcolm in the Middle!

00:03.086 --> 00:04.630
It's a company picnic.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.090
Attended by my new boss

00:04.672 --> 00:07.090
whom  I haven't met yet.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.258
I really like this girl.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.051
Please don't be a jerk

00:08.300 --> 00:10.051
and screw this up.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.303
Laurie, hi.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.305
It is so good

00:11.345 --> 00:13.305
to see you.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.431
Just keep moving.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.266
Hal, do you even know

00:14.473 --> 00:16.266
your new boss is here?

00:16.308 --> 00:18.352
Are you kidding?

00:16.308 --> 00:18.352
They're all here.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.352
There's Landon.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.728
He's the head

00:18.393 --> 00:19.728
of the whole company.

00:19.770 --> 00:23.064
I woke up the next morning with

00:19.770 --> 00:23.064
the dog licking my face.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.693
And I actually thought

00:23.106 --> 00:25.693
it was my husband.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.903
I'm going to go see

00:25.734 --> 00:27.903
what my boys...

00:27.945 --> 00:30.781
It is a real pleasure

00:27.945 --> 00:30.781
to meet you, Mr. Landon.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.574
Same here.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.744
You're playing girls?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.078
Well, the men won't play us

00:37.120 --> 00:38.706
till we beat their ladies

00:37.120 --> 00:38.706
team.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.083
You're responsible

00:38.747 --> 00:42.083
for these valuables

00:38.747 --> 00:42.083
till after the game.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.752
The other coach wants to make

00:42.125 --> 00:43.752
a little wager with you.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.796
I don't know

00:43.794 --> 00:45.796
what's with my skates.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.088
The blades are so dull.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.966
Hey, somebody

00:47.130 --> 00:48.966
unscrewed mine.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.470
If you liked somebody,

00:51.134 --> 00:53.470
would you say something?

00:53.512 --> 00:54.471
I like you, too, Laurie.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.306
Oh, my God.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.306
What?

00:56.348 --> 00:58.099
I was talking

00:56.348 --> 00:58.099
about Gary Spindler.

00:58.141 --> 01:02.312
Now remember, you're

00:58.141 --> 01:02.312
only gonna be tied

00:58.141 --> 01:02.312
together for three hours,

01:02.354 --> 01:04.105
so let's get hopping.

01:37.890 --> 01:42.143
Wow, these are nice woods.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.772
Come on, Malcolm,

01:42.185 --> 01:44.772
we're still friends.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.648
We can still

01:44.813 --> 01:46.648
have fun, right?

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
Why don't you help me

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
with this clue?

01:48.776 --> 01:51.570
"North of the fork

01:48.776 --> 01:51.570
and up a small hill,

01:51.612 --> 01:55.407
under a joke without 'J'

01:51.612 --> 01:55.407
is a small yellow bill."

01:55.449 --> 01:56.992
This doesn't make any sense.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.786
You'd think these clues

01:57.034 --> 01:58.786
would make sense.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.161
Gary Spindler?

02:00.203 --> 02:01.329
Malcolm.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.248
Just tell me what

02:01.371 --> 02:03.248
you see in that jerk.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.000
He high-fives people

02:05.042 --> 02:07.044
when they decide what

02:05.042 --> 02:07.044
they want on their pizza.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.253
He still says,

02:07.086 --> 02:08.253
"It's da bomb."

02:08.295 --> 02:11.090
"Hi, I'm Gary Spindler.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.090
I have a laser pointer."

02:11.131 --> 02:12.633
I think he's nice.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.760
And can we just concentrate

02:12.674 --> 02:14.760
on the scavenger hunt?

02:14.802 --> 02:17.054
We're going to fall

02:14.802 --> 02:17.054
behind if we don't

02:14.802 --> 02:17.054
figure this out.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.179
It's a stupid yellow duck

02:18.221 --> 02:19.974
under that oak tree

02:18.221 --> 02:19.974
right there.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.768
Joke without "J"--

02:20.015 --> 02:22.768
oke, oak tree.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.853
The fork was just back there.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.356
Wow, you were right.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.608
That was great, Malcolm.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.359
You know, you're

02:29.650 --> 02:31.359
really good at this.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.028
Yes, I am.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.696
I have a lot of other

02:33.070 --> 02:34.696
good qualities, too.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.198
In fact, there's lots of things

02:34.738 --> 02:37.198
people would like about me

02:37.240 --> 02:38.366
if they gave me

02:37.240 --> 02:38.366
half a chance.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.701
Can we just do this?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.036
Fine.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.205
Okay, clue number two.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.208
"Look for this gem

02:44.247 --> 02:47.208
on an overgrown hem,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.837
stay to your right or

02:47.250 --> 02:49.837
it might take all night."

02:51.254 --> 02:54.424
For God's sakes,

02:51.254 --> 02:54.424
Gary Spindler?!

02:59.721 --> 03:02.891
Whoo!

03:02.933 --> 03:05.102
What's going on out there?!

03:05.144 --> 03:07.021
We're down by two goals.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.272
I don't know.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.272
I can't get any speed

03:07.062 --> 03:09.272
with these skates.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.691
Well, get them sharpened.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.943
I already had Francis

03:10.732 --> 03:12.943
sharpen them twice.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.529
(coughing in rhythm

03:12.985 --> 03:15.529
with sawing)

03:17.531 --> 03:19.533
Besides, that number 32

03:17.531 --> 03:19.533
is amazing.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.909
She's a monster.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.953
She's crippled

03:20.951 --> 03:22.953
our whole front line.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.706
Whoo!

03:26.957 --> 03:28.207
(giggling)

03:30.293 --> 03:32.546
Sorry to take you away

03:30.293 --> 03:32.546
from your family, Mr. Landon.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.506
Listen, about this whole

03:32.587 --> 03:34.506
Mr. Landon thing...

03:34.548 --> 03:35.507
I know. I know, Burt.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.967
Listen, Burt,

03:35.549 --> 03:36.967
I need your help.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.927
The cubicle dwellers

03:37.009 --> 03:38.927
are getting a little restless.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.428
Oh...

03:40.470 --> 03:43.140
Apparently they know about

03:40.470 --> 03:43.140
my reputation for downsizing.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.683
I thought you could,

03:43.182 --> 03:44.683
uh, I don't know,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.727
shoot them a little B.S.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.727
to calm them down.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.728
Well, actually, I...

03:47.769 --> 03:48.896
Great. Hey, everybody!

03:48.937 --> 03:50.564
I know

03:50.605 --> 03:52.273
there are some concerns here.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.109
So I brought

03:52.315 --> 03:54.109
Mr. Landon over

03:54.151 --> 03:55.694
to put your minds at ease.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.780
Now remember, he's taking

03:55.736 --> 03:58.780
time away from his family,

03:58.822 --> 04:00.323
so not too many questions.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.783
This is beautiful.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.869
Hey, Phil, Mr. Landon

04:01.825 --> 04:03.869
over here

04:03.911 --> 04:06.287
would like to put

04:03.911 --> 04:06.287
our minds at ease.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.748
Isn't that right,  Burt?

04:07.789 --> 04:08.874
Hal?

04:08.916 --> 04:13.754
Burt. Albert. Halbert.

04:08.916 --> 04:13.754
Hal... you know...

04:13.795 --> 04:15.089
I'm sensing

04:15.130 --> 04:17.298
a lot of confusion here.

04:17.340 --> 04:21.220
But the key word to keep

04:17.340 --> 04:21.220
in mind is loyalty.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.303
When you're worried

04:22.345 --> 04:25.015
about your job,

04:22.345 --> 04:25.015
it's very tempting

04:25.057 --> 04:27.726
to make a fellow coworker

04:25.057 --> 04:27.726
look bad,

04:27.768 --> 04:32.147
but who really cares if

04:27.768 --> 04:32.147
someone's wife's an alcoholic?

04:33.356 --> 04:36.317
Or that someone has

04:33.356 --> 04:36.317
a certain unnatural attraction

04:36.359 --> 04:37.402
to women's shoes?

04:39.238 --> 04:42.741
The important thing is,

04:39.238 --> 04:42.741
we're in this together.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.744
And remember,

04:42.783 --> 04:45.744
nobody likes a snitch.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.830
So, let's have

04:47.037 --> 04:48.830
a great picnic, huh?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.627
(chuckles slightly)

05:02.010 --> 05:03.971
"North of the fork

05:02.010 --> 05:03.971
and up a small hill,

05:04.012 --> 05:07.182
under a joke without 'J'

05:04.012 --> 05:07.182
is a small yellow bill."

05:07.224 --> 05:09.350
I don't see a fork,

05:07.224 --> 05:09.350
but I saw a broken spoon.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.352
Shut up. I'm trying

05:09.392 --> 05:11.352
to think of a joke

05:11.394 --> 05:13.396
without a lot

05:11.394 --> 05:13.396
of Js in it.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.774
Ooh, I found a cup.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.525
You're supposed to

05:15.816 --> 05:17.525
look for a fork.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.027
You know, a fork?

05:19.069 --> 05:22.363
The little thing

05:19.069 --> 05:22.363
with... things. Geez!

05:22.405 --> 05:23.824
You go. I'll stay here.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.200
We have to go together.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.119
We're tied to each

05:25.242 --> 05:27.119
other, you idiot.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.037
(groans)

05:33.041 --> 05:33.625
(groans)

05:33.667 --> 05:35.252
(yells)

05:35.294 --> 05:36.962
BOY:

05:35.294 --> 05:36.962
Cool, we got it.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.379
Five more and we win.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.009
(whimpering)

05:42.050 --> 05:43.384
Five more and we win.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.385
You're a genius.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.386
Thanks.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.639
You're, uh... big.

05:49.933 --> 05:50.892
(groans)

05:50.934 --> 05:51.893
Whoo!

05:54.938 --> 05:58.025
Yeah! Hey, Lavernia, looks

05:54.938 --> 05:58.025
like we're going to make it

05:58.066 --> 05:59.400
nine years in a row!

05:59.442 --> 06:00.652
Maybe we should

05:59.442 --> 06:00.652
put some of our

06:00.694 --> 06:03.822
pregnant girls in there

06:00.694 --> 06:03.822
and make it more of a game.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.573
Now, who-who is

06:03.864 --> 06:05.573
that helping?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.285
All that's going to do

06:05.615 --> 06:08.285
is make her feel bad,

06:08.327 --> 06:10.245
plus now all our

06:08.327 --> 06:10.245
pregnant girls

06:10.287 --> 06:12.413
are going to want

06:10.287 --> 06:12.413
to get in the game.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.500
Number 32 is killing us!

06:18.962 --> 06:23.300
Looks like it's time

06:18.962 --> 06:23.300
for a little strategy.

06:23.342 --> 06:26.011
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.429
(player groaning)

06:28.471 --> 06:29.264
Whoo-hoo!

06:29.306 --> 06:30.431
(groaning)

06:30.473 --> 06:32.184
MAN:

06:30.473 --> 06:32.184
Eric!

06:33.060 --> 06:34.311
ALL:

06:33.060 --> 06:34.311
Yeah!

06:34.353 --> 06:36.855
(cheering)

06:45.280 --> 06:49.159
Now let's play some hockey!

07:16.519 --> 07:17.938
You were amazing

07:16.519 --> 07:17.938
out there.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.899
I would have never found

07:17.979 --> 07:20.899
those kids without you.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.192
You know something?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.986
Together we make

07:22.234 --> 07:24.986
the perfect

07:22.234 --> 07:24.986
three-legged person.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.364
I wish we could

07:25.028 --> 07:27.364
stay like this forever.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.698
Yeah.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.908
Wait a minute.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.076
Why can't we?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.493
There's people

07:31.118 --> 07:32.493
that do surgeries.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.289
You're the smartest guy

07:32.535 --> 07:35.289
I've ever met.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.497
Thanks, buddy.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.750
Come on, we got

07:36.539 --> 07:38.750
to find that fork.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.670
He... I... But... He...!

07:42.712 --> 07:44.965
What did I tell you?

07:45.006 --> 07:48.385
You sit in that chair

07:45.006 --> 07:48.385
until the picnic is over.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.511
Excuse me.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.511
Are you Lois?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.097
Yes.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.097
Where do you get off

07:52.139 --> 07:54.515
talking to my wife

07:52.139 --> 07:54.515
about my mother?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.310
Look...

07:54.557 --> 07:56.310
I'll have you know

07:56.351 --> 07:58.895
that I wet my bed every

07:56.351 --> 07:58.895
night till I was 16,

07:58.937 --> 08:01.564
and my mother changed

07:58.937 --> 08:01.564
those sheets for years

08:01.606 --> 08:03.150
and never said a word.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.110
I don't care if they

08:03.191 --> 08:05.110
don't get along.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.527
My mother's

08:05.152 --> 08:06.527
important to me.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.529
Hey, I never said anything

08:06.569 --> 08:08.529
about your mother.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.740
And by the way, I don't

08:08.571 --> 08:10.740
have a porn problem.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.742
Did she tell you

08:10.782 --> 08:12.742
that she was the one

08:12.784 --> 08:14.535
to introduce it

08:12.784 --> 08:14.535
into our home?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.121
You know, I don't have

08:14.577 --> 08:16.121
any interest in your...

08:16.163 --> 08:19.540
It was her idea, and

08:16.163 --> 08:19.540
now I'm the pervert.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.042
I don't know what

08:19.582 --> 08:21.042
it is about porn.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.961
Maybe it's the safety

08:21.084 --> 08:22.961
of emotional distance

08:23.003 --> 08:24.545
or maybe it's just

08:23.003 --> 08:24.545
the thrill of...

08:24.587 --> 08:25.588
All right, that's it!

08:25.630 --> 08:27.174
If you're going

08:25.630 --> 08:27.174
to make me do this,

08:27.215 --> 08:28.425
we're going to do this.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.468
Now sit down!

08:30.593 --> 08:34.555
Your problem is you both

08:30.593 --> 08:34.555
see yourselves as victims.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.183
You've got to talk

08:34.597 --> 08:36.183
to each other.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.809
There's a certain thing

08:36.224 --> 08:37.809
called give and take

08:37.851 --> 08:39.394
you need to make

08:37.851 --> 08:39.394
a relationship work.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.603
Do you understand?

08:40.645 --> 08:41.604
Yes.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.814
I'm not finished with you!

08:42.856 --> 08:44.565
Now, if you are going

08:42.856 --> 08:44.565
to make this work,

08:44.607 --> 08:45.566
you have to make sure

08:45.608 --> 08:48.569
that you are home

08:45.608 --> 08:48.569
every night at 6:30.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.071
Not 6:35. Not 6:31.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.823
You have got to create

08:50.113 --> 08:51.823
an atmosphere of trust.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.574
(cheering)

08:53.616 --> 08:54.742
(grunting)

08:54.784 --> 08:56.453
Go, go!

08:56.495 --> 08:58.038
Yeah!

08:58.079 --> 09:01.124
(all cheering)

09:04.627 --> 09:06.546
(blows whistle)

09:07.839 --> 09:09.090
Hey, I'm starting

09:07.839 --> 09:09.090
to think

09:09.132 --> 09:10.633
we might actually

09:09.132 --> 09:10.633
win this thing.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.634
Damn right we will.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.220
I got 600 bucks

09:11.676 --> 09:13.220
riding on it.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.597
Francis, what are

09:14.929 --> 09:16.597
you doing out here?

09:16.639 --> 09:17.474
You're a man short.

09:17.516 --> 09:18.599
Where's Amos?

09:18.641 --> 09:20.643
He ran out of here,

09:18.641 --> 09:20.643
screaming something about

09:20.685 --> 09:22.812
government helicopters

09:20.685 --> 09:22.812
and murderous clones.

09:22.854 --> 09:26.525
AMOS:

09:22.854 --> 09:26.525
Hello? Is anybody there?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.485
Don't worry. I'll cover for him.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.653
All right.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.653
You're a good man, Francis.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.490
Hey, I'm just doing

09:30.695 --> 09:33.490
what anybody would do.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.700
(groans)

09:36.659 --> 09:39.037
Sorry.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.206
Hey, look at this.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.416
We're doing great.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.833
You're so good at this.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.795
Stop! What are

09:45.752 --> 09:47.795
you doing?

09:47.837 --> 09:48.880
I'm sorry.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.131
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

09:50.173 --> 09:51.132
So, just tell me

09:51.174 --> 09:53.134
what's your big problem with me?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.719
Malcolm.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.719
No, seriously.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.887
I want to know.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.055
Am I too short?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.223
Am I too smart?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.933
Malcolm, can we

09:58.265 --> 09:59.933
please drop this?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.102
I'm smart, okay?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.102
Is that a crime?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.896
I'm sorry I'm not a moron

10:02.143 --> 10:04.896
like Gary Spindler.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.689
Malcolm, stop it.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.691
What are you doing?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.902
I want you to tell me

10:08.733 --> 10:10.902
why you don't like me.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.153
Why are you doing this?

10:12.195 --> 10:13.654
I want a straight answer.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
God! I can't believe

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
I liked you in the third grade.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.576
You liked me

10:15.740 --> 10:17.576
in the third grade?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.120
I knew it! I wasn't crazy.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.120
You did like me.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.663
So, what the hell

10:20.161 --> 10:22.663
has changed? Tell me.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.291
I defy you to tell me.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.585
Nothing! That's the problem.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.668
You're still the same

10:27.710 --> 10:29.296
obsessive, whining know-it-all

10:29.337 --> 10:30.671
who doesn't listen to anyone.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.341
But you did like me

10:30.713 --> 10:33.341
in the third grade?

10:33.383 --> 10:34.968
Malcolm, I  don't  like you.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.512
Can you get that

10:35.009 --> 10:37.512
through your head?

10:37.554 --> 10:38.555
Before...

10:38.597 --> 10:40.681
I just didn't have

10:38.597 --> 10:40.681
a crush on you.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.601
And now I can't stand you.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.103
So, you want me

10:42.642 --> 10:45.103
to tell you why

10:42.642 --> 10:45.103
I don't like you?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.773
You want me to tell you why I

10:45.145 --> 10:48.773
like nice, funny Gary Spindler

10:48.815 --> 10:53.694
and absolutely despise bitter,

10:48.815 --> 10:53.694
annoying Malcolm, do you?!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.947
Look...

10:53.736 --> 10:55.947
Well, I'm going

10:53.736 --> 10:55.947
tell you!

10:55.989 --> 10:58.199
There is something

10:55.989 --> 10:58.199
wrong with you!

10:58.241 --> 10:59.700
I don't know

10:58.241 --> 10:59.700
how you do it.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.328
You're cute, smart, funny,

11:01.369 --> 11:03.746
and somehow you manage

11:01.369 --> 11:03.746
to mess that up!

11:03.788 --> 11:04.747
Like today,

11:04.789 --> 11:06.625
it was an awkward situation

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
but it would have passed,

11:08.209 --> 11:11.421
but you just kept picking

11:08.209 --> 11:11.421
at it and picking at it

11:11.463 --> 11:14.382
until it turned into

11:11.463 --> 11:14.382
this big, horrible thing!

11:14.424 --> 11:16.384
There is something

11:14.424 --> 11:16.384
wrong inside you!

11:16.426 --> 11:17.760
There is something rotten

11:17.802 --> 11:19.638
at the core of

11:17.802 --> 11:19.638
your personality!

11:19.678 --> 11:20.721
You're just off!

11:20.763 --> 11:22.641
That's not even

11:20.763 --> 11:22.641
the worst thing...

11:27.937 --> 11:29.439
I... but... she...

11:29.481 --> 11:31.732
I just opened my purse

11:29.481 --> 11:31.732
to get a Tic Tac,

11:31.774 --> 11:33.776
and he dropped

11:31.774 --> 11:33.776
out of a tree on my back!

11:33.818 --> 11:35.570
I am so sorry.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.031
Now, you go and you

11:35.612 --> 11:38.031
sit down in that chair

11:38.072 --> 11:39.740
and you put

11:38.072 --> 11:39.740
your head down!

11:39.782 --> 11:41.201
Okay.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.994
Did you straighten

11:41.242 --> 11:42.994
things out with Pratt?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.245
Almost.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.830
Oh, for God's sake, Hal,

11:44.287 --> 11:45.830
where is he?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.457
I'll go talk to him.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.334
No, no, no, no, no!

11:47.499 --> 11:49.334
It's too late now.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.835
It would be awkward.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.254
Hal, you work with the man.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.254
He's going to find out.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.755
Look, it'll be,

11:53.296 --> 11:54.755
like, two seconds

11:54.797 --> 11:56.216
of embarrassment

11:54.797 --> 11:56.216
and then it's over.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.676
Now go!

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
Pratt, do you have a moment?

12:11.814 --> 12:12.982
For you, Burt, of course.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.485
You're fired.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.485
What?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.695
I don't think

12:15.527 --> 12:16.695
it's working out,

12:16.735 --> 12:17.987
so let's just make

12:16.735 --> 12:17.987
a clean break.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.614
I haven't even started yet.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.782
What could you possibly

12:19.656 --> 12:21.782
be basing this on?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.869
My gut-- I didn't get this far

12:21.824 --> 12:24.869
without trusting my instincts.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.496
I'm sorry, son.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.747
I think it's best if you

12:26.538 --> 12:28.747
just leave the picnic now.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.337
They have some sort of foil

12:31.834 --> 12:34.337
if you want to wrap that up.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.801
(sobbing)

12:40.843 --> 12:42.887
I'm so sorry, Malcolm.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.887
I just started talking

12:42.929 --> 12:45.806
and I couldn't stop and I

12:42.929 --> 12:45.806
said all those mean things.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.059
I didn't even

12:45.848 --> 12:48.059
mean half of them.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.396
Who am I to say that

12:48.101 --> 12:51.396
your kids will be screwed up?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.814
I mean, you might not

12:51.438 --> 12:53.814
even have kids.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.191
Are you okay?

12:55.233 --> 12:56.817
(blowing)

12:56.859 --> 12:58.903
I think I can stop crying now.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.530
Can you hand me more leaves?

13:00.572 --> 13:02.657
Oh, Malcolm...

13:02.699 --> 13:04.743
No, really,

13:02.699 --> 13:04.743
I'll be fine.

13:04.783 --> 13:08.121
No, Malcolm,

13:04.783 --> 13:08.121
that's poison oak.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.791
Of course it is.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.597
(whistle blows)

13:27.181 --> 13:29.058
Aw, geez, guys-- my bad.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.311
How could I have done that?!

13:31.352 --> 13:33.688
Ah, don't beat

13:31.352 --> 13:33.688
yourself up, buddy.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.022
We all make mistakes.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.525
Shake it off.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.777
You're doing your best.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.447
Eric, I'm doing terrible.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.574
Why is everybody

13:42.489 --> 13:44.574
being so nice to me?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.117
You're doing

13:44.616 --> 13:46.117
your best, man.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.452
You're part of

13:46.159 --> 13:47.452
the team now.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.120
Good or bad,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.120
we're in this together.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.792
Okay, it looks

13:51.998 --> 13:53.792
like you boys

13:53.832 --> 13:55.876
have all the items

13:53.832 --> 13:55.876
on the list here,

13:55.918 --> 13:58.713
plus a wallet,

13:55.918 --> 13:58.713
a girl's bracelet and a fork.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.880
Just give us

13:58.755 --> 13:59.880
the hundred bucks.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.799
There you go.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.550
Thanks.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.842
Now, how about

14:02.592 --> 14:03.842
we separate you two?

14:14.312 --> 14:15.854
I'll miss you.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.697
Nice.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.907
Mom, you don't

14:23.738 --> 14:26.907
have to hold on to me.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.909
I'll be good.

14:28.951 --> 14:29.994
Okay.

14:28.951 --> 14:29.994
Lois...

14:30.953 --> 14:32.121
You don't have to thank me.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.207
Let me just enjoy the rest

14:32.163 --> 14:34.207
of the picnic with my family.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.916
You told my husband

14:34.248 --> 14:35.916
that I was insane?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.918
You told him that

14:35.958 --> 14:37.918
I should be committed?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
I didn't say that.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
And how does letting him

14:39.962 --> 14:42.632
videotape us in bed

14:39.962 --> 14:42.632
help our marriage?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.467
What?! I didn't tell...

14:46.886 --> 14:48.513
Listen, lady,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.513
you got to stop this!

14:48.555 --> 14:49.930
I don't have time for

14:49.972 --> 14:51.224
my own family's problems

14:51.265 --> 14:53.434
without listening

14:51.265 --> 14:53.434
to you two nutcases!

14:53.476 --> 14:55.395
So, why don't you just...

14:59.440 --> 15:01.901
I don't think you understood me.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.909
(screaming)

15:14.706 --> 15:16.290
Oh!

15:24.632 --> 15:25.508
Ow!

15:32.098 --> 15:34.058
Oh!

15:32.098 --> 15:34.058
(laughing)

15:34.100 --> 15:35.351
(both grunting)

15:35.393 --> 15:37.604
(gasping)

15:47.280 --> 15:49.282
(crowd yells excitedly)

15:50.450 --> 15:52.243
(crowd groans)

15:53.870 --> 15:55.622
(crowd yells excitedly)

15:57.874 --> 15:59.041
(crowd groans)

16:00.919 --> 16:03.254
(crowd yells excitedly)

16:09.427 --> 16:11.888
(crowd cheering)

16:37.789 --> 16:39.039
Come on, buddy,

16:37.789 --> 16:39.039
this is it!

16:39.081 --> 16:40.834
We can do this!

16:39.081 --> 16:40.834
Just get in there!

16:40.875 --> 16:42.627
You know, I don't think I can...

16:42.669 --> 16:44.587
Eric, there's something

16:42.669 --> 16:44.587
I got to tell...

16:53.763 --> 16:55.097
Damn it, get up!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.724
Do something!

17:08.528 --> 17:11.197
No!

17:36.639 --> 17:38.140
Eric, you okay?

17:38.182 --> 17:41.227
(groaning):

17:38.182 --> 17:41.227
Someone took the cup

17:38.182 --> 17:41.227
out of my jock.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.730
I'll be fine.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.566
Just win this thing.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.155
Now, just to be clear,

17:53.197 --> 17:55.449
I'm not looking for

17:53.197 --> 17:55.449
anything long-term here.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.897
♪ ♪

18:53.132 --> 18:55.134
♪ ♪

19:14.236 --> 19:15.195
(buzzer)

19:15.237 --> 19:16.489
Yes!

19:16.530 --> 19:17.448
(screaming)

19:17.490 --> 19:20.534
(cheering)

19:22.286 --> 19:23.287
Yeah!

19:23.329 --> 19:25.081
You did it, man!

19:25.123 --> 19:26.248
Way to go!

19:26.290 --> 19:28.208
Let me collect my money

19:28.250 --> 19:31.129
so we can treat Francis

19:28.250 --> 19:31.129
the way he deserves.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.091
You know, there's a funny story

19:31.170 --> 19:35.091
about that money.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.511
(laughing)

19:38.552 --> 19:41.221
You boys did all right.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.016
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.225
Hey, Francis, how

19:43.057 --> 19:45.225
you doing out there?

19:45.267 --> 19:48.312
Well, cold!

19:48.354 --> 19:50.023
Won't be much longer.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.483
There's a kid's skating party

19:50.064 --> 19:52.483
in a half-hour!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.568
(laughter)

19:59.740 --> 20:01.534
Dewey!

20:18.300 --> 20:20.970
(distant grunting)

20:21.012 --> 20:23.222
Dewey, is that... Oh, my God!

20:26.308 --> 20:27.768
(snarling)

20:27.810 --> 20:29.478
Dewey, get away from there.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.938
(snarls)

20:29.520 --> 20:30.938
(gasps)

20:32.815 --> 20:34.108
All right, all right.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.152
Everything's going to be

20:34.150 --> 20:36.152
all right.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.278
Come on, baby.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.156
Come to...

20:40.198 --> 20:41.657
Mama!

20:41.699 --> 20:43.076
Everything's going

20:41.699 --> 20:43.076
to be okay.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.284
Everything's going to be okay.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.494
Everything's going to be...

20:45.536 --> 20:48.206
Who was that idiot

20:45.536 --> 20:48.206
who just pulled out

20:48.247 --> 20:49.749
and flipped everyone off?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.000
That's Pratt, sir.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.334
He starts this week.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.171
No, no, the only thing

20:52.376 --> 20:55.171
he starts this week

20:55.213 --> 20:56.964
is a long lifetime

20:55.213 --> 20:56.964
of misery.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.300
You have our friends at

20:57.006 --> 21:00.300
the IRS give him a call.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.514
So maybe we can hang out

21:03.262 --> 21:05.514
sometime or something.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.516
I mean, when you're better.

21:07.558 --> 21:08.935
Oh, come on, Malcolm.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.228
It's not that bad.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.354
Give me a smile.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.356
Are you smiling?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.358
I can't tell.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.029
I'm smiling.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.281
(muffled grunts)

21:28.370 --> 21:31.373
Well, that went

21:28.370 --> 21:31.373
better than expected.
