WEBVTT

00:05.680 --> 00:08.840
Juventus's most difficult season
in the last 10 years

00:08.920 --> 00:10.520
is drawing to an end.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.960
Coach Pirlo must save the campaign.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.640
The loss against Benevento is a tough blow

00:16.720 --> 00:20.160
and the end of hope for the title
shakes the club.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.640
You need to want to win
these fucking games!

00:22.720 --> 00:24.840
But the group find its strength,

00:24.920 --> 00:27.720
and the win against Sassuolo
gives them confidence.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.400
Ronaldo advances. Ronaldo!

00:32.480 --> 00:35.600
Will the Bianconeri succeed this season?

00:37.440 --> 00:40.320
For Juventus, it's all or nothing.

00:46.120 --> 00:50.120
TURIN
MAY 2021

00:51.880 --> 00:54.200
In three games over one week,

00:54.280 --> 00:56.640
Juventus's entire season is on the line.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.800
They must win the Italian Cup

00:58.880 --> 01:02.600
and qualify for the Champions League
at all costs.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.560
Draws or losses are not allowed.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.040
It's all or nothing.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.800
Come on!

01:12.880 --> 01:14.920
Forward, go!

01:15.040 --> 01:16.000
Come on!

01:16.200 --> 01:18.440
Inside, Fede!

01:18.520 --> 01:20.920
Come on, go!

01:21.120 --> 01:23.000
We all want to play the Champions.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.480
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

01:24.560 --> 01:28.360
Any failure is a personal
failure as a player.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.080
Juventus plays to win...

01:32.480 --> 01:34.240
...not to participate.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.400
It's in the DNA of the club,
and it's also in my DNA.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.880
Their first game is once again
against Conte's Inter,

01:41.960 --> 01:44.320
who, before the end of the season,

01:44.400 --> 01:46.280
have become the Italian Champions,

01:46.360 --> 01:49.040
ending Juventus' nine years
of absolute supremacy.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.360
It leaves a bad taste in my mouth
because it was my dream. After all,

01:58.200 --> 02:02.040
I'm the only player to have won
nine consecutive titles,

02:03.440 --> 02:06.160
and I really hoped to get the tenth.

02:09.920 --> 02:13.000
To see Inter come here
as Italian Champions is tough.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.400
Seeing the title slip away
after nine years

02:16.440 --> 02:18.280
is not nice. It's not easy.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.280
But that's soccer.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.680
That's life.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.240
And this is the Italian League.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.600
It's uncommon to see
a team win for so many years.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.360
It's never happened before.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.800
It happened to Juventus,

02:31.880 --> 02:35.400
but sometimes a year
maybe doesn't go well,

02:35.440 --> 02:38.800
other teams might be better
and manage to win.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.760
But their win should give us

02:41.880 --> 02:45.040
a stronger will to push back and fight

02:45.120 --> 02:47.960
and try to win in the future.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.920
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALKEEPER

02:55.000 --> 02:57.120
A season like this one teaches you

02:57.200 --> 02:59.280
to take nothing for granted.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.040
Everything must be earned

03:03.640 --> 03:06.320
through work

03:06.440 --> 03:11.600
and the desire to take something you think

03:12.240 --> 03:15.560
belongs to you because you deserve it.

03:15.640 --> 03:19.160
You can't take anything for granted,

03:19.240 --> 03:22.000
that's for sure.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.800
It's been a difficult year,

03:25.920 --> 03:28.360
a particular year,

03:28.920 --> 03:31.560
full of expectations, of criticism...

03:31.640 --> 03:32.840
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

03:32.920 --> 03:34.720
and I'll always take responsibility,

03:34.800 --> 03:37.440
because for me Juventus is love.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.080
Quick!

03:47.560 --> 03:52.120
Conte can't wait to ruin Juventus' season.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.560
He'll come to Turin foaming at the mouth.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.560
He will galvanize the team
like never before.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.240
But Inter and Conte...

03:59.320 --> 04:00.800
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

04:00.880 --> 04:03.160
...that particular game

04:03.240 --> 04:07.080
can stir up a pride in Juventus
that, more than once

04:07.160 --> 04:11.520
over the last few months, seemed dormant.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.800
We must force ourselves, mentally,

04:15.880 --> 04:18.680
to live every day like the last...

04:19.960 --> 04:21.520
...to achieve the best result.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.240
Škriniar comes up with the ball.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.480
Wait for him.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.520
When he is close, not much space,

04:27.600 --> 04:31.760
when the space narrows,
you make him come here, always trying

04:31.800 --> 04:35.040
to make him go laterally,
not on the other side.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.320
Score!

04:36.360 --> 04:37.720
Yes!

04:38.800 --> 04:40.760
Those goals against Sassuolo,

04:41.600 --> 04:43.240
a lot of things went wrong,

04:43.320 --> 04:44.920
but what about what I did?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.000
Yes, if everyone thought,

04:47.080 --> 04:49.560
"I could have done more..."

04:49.640 --> 04:52.600
-Yes.
-Then you can build something.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.760
If they think, "He did that..."
"You didn't do..."

04:55.800 --> 04:59.080
First, think about what you did,
then worry about the rest.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.800
We allowed a goal because we weren't tight

05:02.920 --> 05:05.800
with our midfielders,
so you're forced to come out.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.320
If we are tight,
the ball won't get through.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.720
If we are close to each other,
the others must come out, so you can play.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.360
Mine!

05:15.480 --> 05:16.640
Good, that's good.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.920
MATTHIJS DE LIGT
DEFENDER

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That's good!

05:22.720 --> 05:26.040
A quarter mile from
the Juventus training grounds

05:26.120 --> 05:28.360
in the Le Vallette neighborhood,

05:28.440 --> 05:31.480
a new generation of fans
have their own soccer dreams.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.680
I'm Safua, I'm 11,

05:33.760 --> 05:37.360
I was born in Egypt
and I've lived in Turin for eight years.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.040
I'm Amira, I'm 12,

05:40.120 --> 05:43.160
I was born here in Turin,
and I'm Moroccan.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.840
At first, I didn't know there was
a sport called soccer,

05:47.920 --> 05:52.200
but I learned about it
from my brother, who always played.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.520
Come on, quick!

05:54.680 --> 05:56.960
Then I started to watch a few games.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.880
Then I watched a Juventus game
and I became a fan.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.440
Cristiano Ronaldo made me love the game

06:06.520 --> 06:09.840
because he was poor and he became

06:09.920 --> 06:12.280
one of the best players ever.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.080
I wanted to be good
and not be made fun of.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.680
My father didn't want me to play.
He said girls couldn't play soccer.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.880
My mom signed me up.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.160
TURIN
MAY 15, 2021

06:34.920 --> 06:37.760
Welcome to the Allianz Stadium in Turin.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.840
It's Serie A day 37,

06:40.920 --> 06:43.960
and today it's Juventus-Inter.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.200
These are important points to hope for

06:48.280 --> 06:50.640
to land one of the top four spots,

06:50.720 --> 06:53.320
which would mean Champions League.

06:53.400 --> 06:58.200
Winner of nine consecutive titles,
Juventus, the current Italian champions,

06:58.320 --> 07:02.680
play against Inter, the new champions,
who will be first in the league

07:02.840 --> 07:04.520
until the end of the season.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.720
We have to die on that field.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.440
If we are not dead, we can still get up.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.760
We have want the win,

07:11.840 --> 07:13.200
that's all it counts.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.960
They want to come here,
be great and celebrate.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.440
We can't let them.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.640
No celebrating for them. We have to win.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.600
Guys, let's go.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.440
Let's go. Let's do this.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.720
Here comes Inter on the field.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.320
Chiellini comes out first,

07:29.400 --> 07:32.360
the captain in this important game.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.480
It's 4-4-2 for Coach Andrea Pirlo.
Here we go.

07:35.560 --> 07:39.000
CR7 gets the first touch of the game.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.880

in the middle for Chiesa.

It's a header for Kulusevski.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.800
First chance for Juventus

07:48.880 --> 07:50.840
from Dejan Kulusevski.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.600
Well done!

07:53.200 --> 07:56.920
Inter moving forward with Martínez,
Bentancur hoping it's not a foul.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.440
It's a yellow card

07:58.520 --> 08:01.920
for Rodrigo Bentancur
for a foul on Lautaro Martínez.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.640
Go towards him, Fede!

08:06.720 --> 08:08.360
Chiesa gets the ball back.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.440
Chiesa faces Škriniar, he feints

08:10.600 --> 08:11.880
and shoots.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.880
Deflected, Kulusevski again.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.040
This time deflected by de Vrij.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.000
It's a corner kick for Juventus,
a good opportunity.

08:20.120 --> 08:24.520
Cuadrado crosses. Look out,
a Juventus player is down.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.320
Penalty for Juventus.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.080
He gave it.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.840
Cristiano is ready. The referee whistles.

08:32.080 --> 08:32.920
Don't move!

08:33.240 --> 08:38.200
Ronaldo shoots, saved,
then Ronaldo! Juventus scores!

08:38.280 --> 08:42.360
Juventus, one. Inter, zero.
The king has scored again,

08:42.440 --> 08:43.880
CR7 scored!

08:43.960 --> 08:47.840
Barella against de Ligt,
surprised by the pass to Eriksen.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.960
Eriksen to Darmian.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.320
Darmian against Danilo. Back to Eriksen.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.360
It's a goal.
Inter ties with Romelu Lukaku.

09:11.520 --> 09:16.520
At minute 35 in the first half,
it's Juventus-Inter 1-1.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.160
Ronaldo...

09:20.240 --> 09:21.840
he passes to Danilo.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.760
Danilo to Kulusevski. Danilo advances.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.400
A pass to Kulusevski. Danilo!

09:30.480 --> 09:32.520

the Swedish player crosses inside,

09:42.360 --> 09:43.720
a powerful shot deflected

09:43.760 --> 09:45.000
to beat Handanovič.

09:45.080 --> 09:49.120
Juventus, two. Inter, one.
At exactly minute three of injury time.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.200
Good. We have the right attitude.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.320
We did well, but it's not enough.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.360
We must keep this up
until the 90th minute.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.080
The pressure is perfect,
we can't be fooled.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.760
If they start from the keeper,
they must stay there,

10:11.880 --> 10:13.760
they must raise the pace.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.000
Ball to the goalkeeper,

10:15.080 --> 10:16.280
stay in position.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.280
They need to speed up things.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.400
When we have the ball,

10:20.520 --> 10:22.360
be patient with the passes,

10:22.480 --> 10:26.880
once or twice,
then straight to the other fullback.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.280
Don't hurry.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.600
We don't have to get to the strikers
right away. We can go around.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.760
Rodrigo here, with two forwards,
they can't keep up if we go around twice.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.720
Keep the pressure up. Let's win this.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.600
The second half is about to begin,

11:34.640 --> 11:36.160

11:36.400 --> 11:38.560

11:38.640 --> 11:40.800
and blocks it safely.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.000
Ronaldo is out, Morata is in.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.640
This is Andrea Pirlo's second change.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.440
Cross in, a deflection.

Chiellini gets a yellow card
for protesting.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.240
Chiellini, wide to Cuadrado.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.720
Cuadrado controls the ball.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.320
Juan faces the defender, he goes right,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.800
he wants to cross, he goes down. Wait!

12:55.880 --> 12:57.640
Penalty for Juventus

12:57.760 --> 12:59.320
for a foul on Juan Cuadrado,

12:59.400 --> 13:02.320
another episode,
another contact, another penalty.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.320
His first penalty kick for Juventus.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.920
Cuadrado shoots. Goal!

13:09.040 --> 13:12.160
Juventus, three. Inter, two. Perfect!

13:12.240 --> 13:15.200
Cuadrado's penalty low in the corner,

13:15.280 --> 13:19.120
his second personal goal
at minute 88. It's 3-2!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.680
And the game ends here.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.920
Juventus beats Inter 3-2.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.160
Juventus, still in the race
for a Champions League spot,

13:28.240 --> 13:31.120
now has 75 points in the ranking.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.200
Come on!

13:37.600 --> 13:41.560
The victory against Inter
keeps the Champions League hopes alive.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.160
Juventus is now fifth,

13:44.280 --> 13:46.920
after Napoli, Milan, Atalanta, and Inter.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.960
And in just four days,

13:49.040 --> 13:52.760
they will be playing Atalanta
in the Italian Cup final.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
What do we do?

13:54.280 --> 13:56.680
I was thinking about 4-1-4-1.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.120
So Kulu would be here, in that case.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.840
Rabiot closer to him.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.200
Him here, him here. Pessina here.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.360
We'll tell Kulu not to get too close.

14:08.440 --> 14:12.640
When he plays there,
it looks like he's a forward.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.320
We should tell him
that he should feel free to move

14:18.400 --> 14:22.600
according to the situation,
the ball, the rival, the space,

14:22.960 --> 14:24.480
or he's acting as a forward.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.080
I think Kulu should move
like he did against Inter

14:28.160 --> 14:31.080
and Mac should be behind Kulu, basically.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.200
Or he can wait.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.920
Yes, he should wait, for sure.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.280
He's between them.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.280
He waits, if the first comes low,
he waits, turns around...

14:40.280 --> 14:43.360
I think that this idea
of Kulu being there and Benta...

14:43.440 --> 14:44.840
It's very good.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.360
Yes, I agree.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.800
How's it going, guys?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.040
How are you?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.880
From unhorsed to...

14:56.240 --> 14:58.760
Well, it gave us three more days to live.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.040
Holding the reins... With the horse...

15:01.640 --> 15:03.720
The "giving it all" that characterizes...

15:05.200 --> 15:09.200
...Juventus' games
must be even stronger now.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.200
It must be our motto because

15:11.520 --> 15:14.720
even if our hopes are faint today,

15:14.800 --> 15:16.960
we must believe it until the end.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.120
The Italian Cup is a fundamental goal.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.080
In preparing for the game,

15:25.160 --> 15:30.040
Pirlo can count on the help of his friend
and former teammate Gigi Buffon.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.600
If they come in six, Wes,

15:32.680 --> 15:34.520
you take Juan's place.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.040
Malinovskyi on corners?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.320
Yes, I think so.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.560
They come here, all here.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.040
Rodri, eye on the second post, Rodri.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.520
Pass it, come on.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.760
Tell us what you think
about our penalty takers.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.360
-Yes.
-When we need to decide.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.760
The coach will decide.
But you can have a chat with him, see...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.560
Maybe someone scores all the goals
because they got lucky.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.680
You know who's better.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.680
Andrea has this shield

16:07.800 --> 16:11.120
that seems impervious

16:11.440 --> 16:15.080
to everything that happens around him,

16:15.200 --> 16:17.880
and that's a great strength.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.080
-Can you sit?
-I think I saw...

16:21.160 --> 16:22.000
Wes?

16:22.080 --> 16:25.600
Cristiano, of course, Álvaro and Dybala,
even if they're not...

16:25.880 --> 16:27.560
-Juan.
-Juan.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.120
-Dani.
-McKennie.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.240
-McKennie.
-I think Arthur is good too.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.440
Arthur, yes. If he's on the field.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.760
Let me tell you something.

16:37.840 --> 16:38.800
I...

16:38.880 --> 16:40.480
-I pick a side and...
-Five.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.640
I've always thought that.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.160
-They'll shoot there twice.
-Exactly.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.240
They have to shoot two that way.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.880
I've always thought that, believe me.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.880
-Five penalties... I'll go on one side.
-Yes.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.360
I'll get one.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.280
Has it ever happened

16:59.360 --> 17:02.720
that a goalkeeper will always
go one way on all five penalties?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.600
I remember I did it once...

17:04.680 --> 17:06.520
-In the Confederations Cup.
-Yes.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.240
I changed only one time,

17:08.320 --> 17:10.240
-and...
-Yes.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.160
It's true.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.480
-Confederations.
-Yes.

17:17.080 --> 17:21.240
While Pirlo and Buffon
prepare their penalty strategy,

17:21.320 --> 17:24.200
Bonucci invites Chiellini
to his restaurant

17:24.280 --> 17:26.160
to talk about the season.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.800
I made too many mistakes.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.320
Too inconsistent.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.400
Other teams make mistakes too.
They're just like us.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.800
Napoli and Milan

17:33.920 --> 17:36.280
-made mistakes too.
-We weren't like them.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.720
Also I don't know what you're gonna do.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.080
You don't even know.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.800
Claudio was the first to leave us,
then Barzaglione,

17:45.680 --> 17:48.320
now Gigi comes and goes.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.080
I'm gonna be the next one.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.680
-You all left me.
-You'll be the last.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.480
You abandoned me.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.560
You're also the youngest, so it's normal.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.080
Wait, it's not decided.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.440
Maybe another year together.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.800
Yes, but anyway, I mean in general.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.080
We'll share the burden one more time.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.640
At least some help carrying it.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.000
We have to be light.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.720
We need to run after the Bergamo guys.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.160
For Gigione, the final goodbye
is on Wednesday.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.320
He'll be pumped.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.520
Let's win a trophy
and take a nice picture.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.800
Let's end the year with a trophy.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.680
If we're lucky
and Milan doesn't win in Bergamo,

18:36.680 --> 18:39.080
we'll go to the Champions,
win two trophies,

18:39.240 --> 18:41.000
the Italian Cup and the Super Cup.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.760
The story will change.

18:49.080 --> 18:53.680
The time for strategies and physical
and mental preparation is over.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.760
Juventus has to win the cup at all costs.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.920
For Pirlo,
it's time to talk to the press office,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.240
directed by Chief Communication
Officer Claudio Albanese,

19:04.320 --> 19:06.440
in preparation for the press conference.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.520
Press conference.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.880
A final conquest, kicking Inter out

19:12.400 --> 19:14.160
in the semifinals...

19:14.720 --> 19:17.000
Let's remember the journey.

19:17.480 --> 19:21.240
It's important to maintain the optimism
of previous press conferences.

19:21.320 --> 19:25.440
This is one where playing the card

19:25.920 --> 19:29.000
of pride and optimism works better,

19:29.080 --> 19:30.280
because it's one game.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.080
There is a trophy,
and we won another one already.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.560
We need to be...

19:35.480 --> 19:37.760
We always should be, but especially now,

19:38.400 --> 19:40.160
we need to be positive.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.800
I think that if you say something

19:43.000 --> 19:44.800
about playing in front of fans,

19:44.920 --> 19:47.240
it's a good thing for everyone.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.040
I think some players and also some teams

19:51.160 --> 19:53.880
are influenced by playing without fans.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.560
And there are other players

19:57.640 --> 19:59.240
who are not so badly influenced.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.040
Like those players
who are great during practice,

20:02.080 --> 20:03.880
but don't perform in a game.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Some need the fans, like our team,

20:07.560 --> 20:10.480
it helps you focus, and there are those

20:10.560 --> 20:13.280
-who prefer no one.
-Atalanta with our fans...

20:13.400 --> 20:16.520
This is the 20th Italian Cup final

20:16.960 --> 20:19.640
in Juventus' history,

20:20.560 --> 20:23.160
a record with 13 victories.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.080
We have other data, but not for you.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.480
-So?
-Nothing.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.920
On the eve of the final,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.480
in an unpredictable season for Juventus,

20:34.560 --> 20:38.200
the veterans share their experience
with the younger players.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.880
How are you, Gigio?

20:40.960 --> 20:42.680
You said it's your last final.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.960
I feel better than the last final

20:46.560 --> 20:48.800
against Milan three years ago.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.000
It was the first time,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.520
it was more difficult.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.480
Today, I gotta say,

20:55.040 --> 20:56.720
I feel like I'm 20

20:56.800 --> 20:58.560
with a lifetime of soccer to play.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.000
I tell myself, "Tomorrow I have a final."

21:01.400 --> 21:03.640
"I will have many more in the future."

21:04.280 --> 21:05.400
I'm relaxed.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.160
Chiesa, you will be able to say
that you played a final with Gigi.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.160
Your kids will ask,

21:11.480 --> 21:13.560
"Did you really play with Buffon?"

21:13.680 --> 21:17.000
"Yes, I really did."
You'll show them the film.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.800
REGGIO EMILIA
MAY 19, 2021

21:23.080 --> 21:24.880
UNTIL THE END

21:26.320 --> 21:27.800
The Italian Cup final

21:27.880 --> 21:31.160
is the first game in 15 months

21:31.280 --> 21:33.960
where fans are being allowed
into the stadium.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.760
They'll be 4,300 fans.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.320
Go, Juventus

21:38.440 --> 21:41.160
Being here today

21:41.240 --> 21:43.160
is to be part of history

21:43.240 --> 21:47.880
and witness an important moment
of a new start and rebirth,

21:47.960 --> 21:49.560
which is incredible.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.960
Juve, Juve

21:51.040 --> 21:55.560
Olè, olè, olè, olè
Juve, Juve

21:55.640 --> 22:00.200
The 4,300 fans will be eye witnesses

22:00.280 --> 22:03.480
to Buffon's last game
wearing a Juventus jersey.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.200
Gigi Buffon
Jump with us

22:06.320 --> 22:08.920
Gigi Buffon
Jump with us

22:09.120 --> 22:11.480
Gigi Buffon
Jump with us

22:11.720 --> 22:13.840
It's like the end of a novel,

22:13.920 --> 22:16.640
perfect for Buffon's career,
and it's no surprise

22:16.760 --> 22:19.040
that fate has given him

22:19.400 --> 22:22.480
this kind of final chapter.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.120
I get emotional when I talk
about Buffon because...

22:27.360 --> 22:28.360
he's different.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.440
He is...

22:31.240 --> 22:33.880
I really get emotional.
I'm not pretending.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.800
He is a different kind of person.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.440
He has a different sensibility,

22:41.960 --> 22:45.280
a different way of reading situations

22:47.640 --> 22:49.000
than us humans.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.240
Us normal people.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.680
To be at a Juventus level...

22:57.080 --> 22:58.600
...you have to win trophies.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.760
You have to maintain Juventus' DNA.

23:02.040 --> 23:07.080
This is how the players can build
Juventus' history.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.920
We were born for these games.

23:10.080 --> 23:13.400
The 74th Italian Cup
will be awarded tonight.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.200
Tonight, it's Atalanta-Juventus.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.720
Eleven players playing hard
for their teammates.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.240
This is especially important
during the finals.

23:22.320 --> 23:27.760
We showed it in the last few games,
when we suffer, we suffer together.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.320
We want this win for the fans,

23:30.400 --> 23:32.640
for us, for Gigi Buffon,

23:32.720 --> 23:34.640
in his last final with this jersey.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.800
We can do it!

23:37.480 --> 23:38.480
Come on!

23:38.640 --> 23:40.080
Let's go, guys. Come on!

23:42.000 --> 23:46.240
Keep your mind clear in difficult times.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.720
Here we are. It's all ready.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.400
Juventus will start.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.080
From left to right on your screens,

23:54.160 --> 23:56.720
black and white jerseys, white shorts.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.360
Atalanta on the other side,

23:58.440 --> 24:01.440
black and blue jerseys,
black shorts and socks.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.520
Expectations are high.

24:04.080 --> 24:07.840
In the stands, next to president
and Executive Chairman Andrea Agnelli,

24:07.920 --> 24:11.520
sits John Elkann,
president and CEO of Exor,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.520
owner company of Juventus.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.040
Here we are, we're ready. Until the end.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.840
Hope you enjoy Atalanta-Juventus,

24:19.920 --> 24:21.600
the Italian Cup final.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.160
Look out, a mistake.
Pessina runs towards the goal.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.560
Pessina to Zapata.
Zapata inside to Pessina.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.160
Pessina, pressed from behind.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.160
The Juventus players touched the ball.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.560
Zapata tries to outrun de Ligt,

24:36.680 --> 24:40.440
Zapata shoots. Buffon!

24:40.760 --> 24:42.680
Buffon, great save by Gigi!

24:43.160 --> 24:46.440
Game 685 with Juventus.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.200
Here comes Zapata.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.640
Zapata controls the ball. Zapata!

24:52.920 --> 24:53.840
Outside.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.560
Atalanta is controlling the game
in the first five minutes.

24:58.640 --> 25:02.000
Watch out, de Roon is wide.
Well done Bentancur,

25:02.080 --> 25:04.680
who gets the ball. Kulusevski advances.

25:04.760 --> 25:05.840
Come on!

25:05.920 --> 25:07.960
Kulusevski followed by two players,

25:08.040 --> 25:12.000
inside for McKennie, no luck!

25:12.080 --> 25:14.280
Free kick for Atalanta.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.360
Andrea Pirlo turns 42 today.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.920
The Juventus fans get loud.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.720
De Ligt tries to find Kulusevski, no luck.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.440
The Dutch player heads it back,

25:27.520 --> 25:30.360
a mistake, Zapata touches it.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.680
Buffon.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.360
Careful with these back passes.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.200
Ball to Pessina.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.440
Pessina controls it.
The defender, Pessina to Freuler.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.160
Freuler!

25:43.120 --> 25:44.200
Outside.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.240
McKennie to Kulusevski.

25:47.320 --> 25:51.160
Number 44 has space.
Inside to Ronaldo. Watch out!

25:51.240 --> 25:54.760
Cristiano Ronaldo is on the ground,
the ball stays there.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.200
Kulusevski!

26:02.160 --> 26:04.280
Juventus scores!

26:04.360 --> 26:05.840
Dejan Kulusevski!

26:05.920 --> 26:07.440
The score changes,

26:07.520 --> 26:10.200
Atalanta, zero. Juventus, one.

26:19.480 --> 26:23.080
Quick one to de Roon,
two on him, wide to Zapata,

26:23.240 --> 26:26.480
cross inside, the header, Buffon!

26:27.840 --> 26:29.240
Freuler towards the goal,

26:29.320 --> 26:31.840
wide to Hateboer, back to Malinovskyi.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.200
Malinovskyi!

26:35.920 --> 26:37.160
Atalanta ties.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.440
Atalanta, one. Juventus, one.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.080
Malinovskyi scored.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.360
And that's the first half.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.080
A good game and a close game.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.880
You can't lose the match-ups, Fede.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.320
Start playing.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.760
You didn't play.
Have the guts to challenge the defender.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.800
No fear, one on one.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.360
Past the defender and go.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.360
Show me some balls.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.920
Come on, we can win this.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.640
Come on!

27:13.560 --> 27:15.160
Wait, we're missing one.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.120
Can we go?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.280
Chiesa is missing.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.240
-Who's missing?
-Chiesa.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.400
Relax, destroy Toloi and that's it.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.840
And give me a hug after a goal.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.400
Come on!

27:27.520 --> 27:28.480
Okay, kid.

27:28.600 --> 27:29.720
-Come on!
-Come on!

27:29.920 --> 27:31.040
Let's go!

27:31.120 --> 27:32.040
Fede!

27:33.840 --> 27:35.960
The second half of the 2020-2021

27:36.040 --> 27:39.960
Italian Cup final between
Atalanta and Juventus is about to start.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.280
Coach Andrea Pirlo is focused.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.800
It's a long battle, we know.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.840
CR7 kicks off the second half.

27:53.640 --> 27:58.280
We begin. Enjoy the second half
of Atalanta-Juventus.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.400
De Ligt.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.920
Watch out, cross inside to McKennie.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.240
Outside. So close,
a great chance for Juventus

28:06.360 --> 28:08.720
three minutes into the second half.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.360
Rabiot again, wide to Chiesa.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.440
Chiesa faces Hateboer,
inside, the deflection!

28:15.560 --> 28:18.720
Great chance for Juventus,
Gollini saves it.

28:18.800 --> 28:22.480
Chiellini protects it,
inside for Cristiano.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.760
Chiesa!

28:25.600 --> 28:27.040
He hits the post!

28:27.160 --> 28:29.360
What a miss by Federico Chiesa.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.200
Incredible chance for Juventus.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.400
Go, Juventus

28:33.680 --> 28:35.120
Another chance for Juventus.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.240
Chiesa behind Hateboer.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.320
Chiesa confuses him with his feints,

28:41.440 --> 28:43.600
Federico, Kulusevski,

28:43.680 --> 28:45.360
Kulusevski to Chiesa.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.320
Chiesa!

28:48.000 --> 28:50.120
Juventus scores!

28:50.360 --> 28:51.680
Federico Chiesa!

28:51.760 --> 28:53.280
It's 2-1 for Juventus!

28:53.720 --> 28:56.440
Chiesa, great play!

29:01.240 --> 29:02.640
There's a substitution now.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.400
The author of the goal is out,
Federico Chiesa. Paulo Dybala is in.

29:07.960 --> 29:11.320
The Juventus fans are singing
at Mapei Stadium.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.160
The ovation,
all standing for Federico Chiesa.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.280
His teammates are hugging him.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.760
Substitutions. Leo Bonucci now in

29:20.840 --> 29:23.880
for a marvelous Dejan Kulusevski.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.120
Luigi Gollini, the entire Atalanta team

29:27.600 --> 29:29.160
in Buffon's box.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.680
The cross inside, McKennie's header.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.000
Whistle!

29:35.160 --> 29:36.480
We can counterattack.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.160
One minute left, 60 seconds.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.680
Cuadrado looks up
to the other side for Danilo.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.280
Close to Ronaldo, also to Rabiot,

29:45.400 --> 29:46.840
Danilo sees the goal.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.000
Dani keeps it, moves to the right, Danilo!

29:50.120 --> 29:51.520
Gollini saves it.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.200
Last chance for Atalanta,

29:56.280 --> 29:57.640
Twenty seconds left.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.520
Ilicic inside, Chiellini!

30:01.160 --> 30:03.000
Throw in for Atalanta.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.520
Ten seconds to go,

30:04.600 --> 30:06.880
minute 94. High ball

30:07.000 --> 30:09.760
for Zapata, Buffon comes out!

30:09.840 --> 30:11.200
And the story ends

30:11.280 --> 30:15.520
with the last ball
in the arms of the best keeper in history.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.840
Raise your hands, the game is over!

30:18.200 --> 30:19.160
It's over!

30:19.240 --> 30:24.400
Juventus wins the Italian Cup
for the 14th time.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.720
The umpteenth triumph for the club,

30:27.840 --> 30:29.480
who wins their second trophy

30:29.600 --> 30:32.400
of the season after the Super Cup.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.040
Three years after last time

30:34.160 --> 30:36.000
we will raise this cup again.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.840
No one else in history
has won it so many times.

30:42.200 --> 30:46.720
With Gigi we played
the last final together.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.960
Our destinies will go separate ways.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.640
He made another masterpiece,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.400
playing a great game.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.800
Seeing a 43 year-old player
with that kind of strength and adrenaline,

30:59.880 --> 31:02.640
the will to help the team,

31:02.720 --> 31:05.880
gives you something more,

31:05.960 --> 31:07.960
so the victory was also his.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.360
Champions
Champions

31:11.480 --> 31:13.680
Olè, olè, olè

31:14.640 --> 31:16.320
Champions

31:16.760 --> 31:18.520
The will to get better,

31:18.600 --> 31:20.080
to reach your goals...

31:20.160 --> 31:21.280
FEDERICO CHIESA
FORWARD

31:21.360 --> 31:23.840
...it's his best lesson.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.120
Juventus has had years
of supremacy in Italy,

31:27.200 --> 31:29.320
so next year, we want to dominate again.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.080
DEJAN KULUSEVSKI
MIDFIELDER

31:32.160 --> 31:33.480
We learned from Pirlo.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.240
Especially us younger players,
we learned a lot from him,

31:37.440 --> 31:40.800
and I'm happy he was with us this year.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.040
He was a fantastic player
and he played at a high level.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.280
He understands the players,
which is very important.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.920
He was inside the dressing room,
and he knows what we think.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.320
It's been a rocky road.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.200
But, it's definitely been
one hell of an experience so far.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.560
But, you know...

32:05.880 --> 32:08.520
Definitely next season,
we're looking forward

32:08.600 --> 32:11.840
to achieving a lot more
than we did this season.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.760
This is Juventus.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.160
Despite many difficulties,

32:19.320 --> 32:21.960
to win two trophies this year

32:22.200 --> 32:24.600
is a sign of great will,

32:24.680 --> 32:27.720
and I'm very happy.

32:28.040 --> 32:32.080
The younger players, the older,
the managers, the coach...

32:32.240 --> 32:33.600
It's a victory that,

32:33.720 --> 32:37.120
with all the difficulties
of the last month,

32:37.200 --> 32:39.680
has given us a lot of energy.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.640
Come on, Giorgione!

32:44.200 --> 32:46.600
I've had a great relationship
with everyone,

32:46.680 --> 32:50.680
which has been very satisfying.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.640
My relationship with the veterans,

32:52.720 --> 32:58.440
those I played with,
from Gigi and Chiello to Leo,

32:58.760 --> 33:02.720
but especially my relationship
with the new players, the rookies.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.200
I had ideas I wanted to get across.

33:05.720 --> 33:10.280
I had a vision that I tried to instill
in the young players

33:10.360 --> 33:12.520
with great calm and assurance,

33:12.600 --> 33:15.920
and this allowed me
to achieve these results.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.320
Olè, olè, olè

33:48.040 --> 33:49.120
Come on!

33:49.240 --> 33:51.280
Come on!

33:58.160 --> 34:01.280
Juve!

34:11.120 --> 34:13.440
Winning the Italian Cup

34:14.280 --> 34:18.120
is very important for the season because

34:19.160 --> 34:20.960
they criticized and insulted us,

34:21.040 --> 34:24.320
yet we played and won two finals.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.400
And...

34:25.680 --> 34:28.560
Yes, Super Cup and Italian Cup,
but you have to win them,

34:28.640 --> 34:33.560
and they came back to Turin,
so that is already

34:34.520 --> 34:38.360
a retort to many critics who told us

34:38.440 --> 34:41.640
we were not good anymore,
that Juventus must be rebuilt.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.440
A team that needs to be rebuilt
doesn't win two out of two finals.

34:53.520 --> 34:57.160
Juventus still has one last
fundamental goal,

34:57.440 --> 34:59.480
the Champions League qualification.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.560
Fifth, one point below Napoli,

35:02.800 --> 35:05.480
the Bianconeri must win
to clinch the fourth spot.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.800
But a win may not be enough.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.840
The Milan and Napoli scores are crucial.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.400
It's not an option,

35:14.360 --> 35:16.560
not qualifying for the Champions League.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.800
We will.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.160
Not qualifying would be...

35:21.920 --> 35:23.040
...a failure.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.000
BOLOGNA
MAY 23, 2021

35:25.080 --> 35:27.280
The last day of the Serie A season,

35:27.360 --> 35:28.960
the day of the verdicts.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.560
Juventus wants a spot
in the Champions League,

35:31.640 --> 35:33.760
but are not in control their destiny.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.120
At this point, apparently,

35:36.280 --> 35:39.120
one way or another,
a decision has been taken.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.120
But, again, we need to focus,

35:42.200 --> 35:45.680
as we have for over a month,
on the here and now.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.800
Juventus needs a great team effort.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.560
They have to beat Bologna
and hope that either Napoli or Milan,

35:56.800 --> 36:00.160
who are playing Verona and Atalanta,
respectively, will not win.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.600
Until the end, guys. Let's win it.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.680
This is one of those evenings

36:11.800 --> 36:13.320
that one must live.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.440
Tonight, it really is all or nothing.

36:18.960 --> 36:23.640
Never lose focus, we can win at the end,
so keep your head in the game.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.560
We must be stronger than everyone.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.920
Against everyone else, let's play for us.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.440
From the Renato Dall'Ara in Bologna

36:36.520 --> 36:38.120
good evening from Zambruno.

36:38.200 --> 36:42.480
It's day 38, the last day
of the Serie A season,

36:42.560 --> 36:44.160
and this is the last dance.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.520
To qualify for the Champions,

36:46.600 --> 36:50.320
Juventus must win and hope that,
at the same time,

36:50.400 --> 36:53.400
either Milan or Napoli ties or loses.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.360
Come on, all together!

36:56.000 --> 36:57.400
Here we go, we're ready.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.040
Dybala to Danilo.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.760
The ball! Push forward!

37:09.880 --> 37:11.120
Too strong for Morata,

37:11.160 --> 37:15.080
Morata with his back heel,
Kulusevski is looking around, watch out,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.440
the ball inside.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.160
Rabiot controls it,

37:19.200 --> 37:21.560
he hits the cross bar, another shot!

37:21.640 --> 37:22.880
It's a goal! Chiesa!

37:23.080 --> 37:24.640
Juventus scores!

37:24.920 --> 37:26.880
Bologna, zero. Juventus, one.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Goal!

37:28.200 --> 37:29.120
Chiesa!

37:29.440 --> 37:32.960
Ball inside to Dybala, he looks, Dybala.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.360
Dybala advances!

37:35.520 --> 37:38.160
Paulo Dybala inside to Morata.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.400
Bologna, zero. Juventus, two.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.160
We have a score update.

37:43.280 --> 37:47.000
Milan is up in Bergamo,
1-0, penalty by Kessié.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.840
Come on, Álvaro!

37:52.160 --> 37:53.840
Morata to Dybala.

37:54.120 --> 37:58.080
Dybala keeps it between the lines,
good for Kulusevski.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.160
Rabiot!

38:01.280 --> 38:03.360
Bologna, zero. Juventus, three.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.960
Another goal, Adrien Rabiot, 3-0.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.840
Come on!

38:10.080 --> 38:12.480
Another nice play, smooth.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.880
And so the first half ends
at the Dall'Ara.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.160
Stay focused, don't reopen the game.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.800
Keep playing this way. Come on!

38:31.760 --> 38:35.160
Once again, coming to you
from the Dall'Ara stadium in Bologna.

38:35.280 --> 38:38.280
Napoli is still 0-0 against Hellas Verona.

38:38.600 --> 38:42.000
Milan is up in Bergamo
after Kessié's penalty.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.200
Here we go again.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.920
Come on!

38:47.800 --> 38:48.640
Come on!

38:52.080 --> 38:53.680
Good!

38:53.800 --> 38:56.760
Nice ball to Morata,
great control, he advances.

38:56.840 --> 39:00.200
Morata moves forward, Morata!
The save and then the ball goes in!

39:02.640 --> 39:04.440
It's 4-0 for Juventus.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.040
What a great goal.

39:08.120 --> 39:12.200
Juventus' second half starts
in the best way possible.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.680
At the moment, Napoli is second.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.160
Napoli is also up 1-0.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.920
At this moment,
Juventus is out of the Champions League.

39:28.360 --> 39:31.560
Even if they're playing a great game,

39:32.280 --> 39:33.480
it doesn't matter.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.080
-Verona!
-Verona!

39:39.160 --> 39:42.480
-I told you, they kept attacking.
-Verona scored.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.120
At minute 70,

39:45.160 --> 39:46.640
with 20 minutes to go,

39:46.760 --> 39:48.360
Verona tied.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.960
The score changes at the Maradona Stadium,

39:51.040 --> 39:53.880
it's Napoli, one, Hellas Verona, one.

39:53.960 --> 39:57.120
Juventus is in the Champions League,
Napoli is out.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.920
The header to Rodrigo Palacio.

40:01.880 --> 40:06.000
Palacio puts it in, the shot,
and Bologna scores.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.680
Bologna, one. Juventus, four.
Five minutes to go.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.800
At this point,

40:15.880 --> 40:20.840
those suffering from heart conditions
should just turn everything off.

40:23.400 --> 40:27.200
Napoli, with two minutes to go,
the score is 1-1,

40:27.320 --> 40:29.200
so, at the moment, Napoli is out.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.960
Instead, Kessié scored,
2-0 for Milan, Atalanta is fourth.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.200
Milan is second at this point.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.200
And so the game ends here.

40:40.320 --> 40:43.080
Juventus wins 4-1.

40:43.280 --> 40:46.320
So now, obviously, we all wait.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.280
At the moment,
with Milan winning and Napoli in a tie,

40:50.360 --> 40:52.840
Juventus would make the Champions League,

40:52.920 --> 40:55.800
but Napoli has four minutes
of injury time.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.640
Anything can happen.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.960
Napoli on the attack. Saved.

41:01.080 --> 41:04.760
If Napoli scores,
Juventus goes back to Europa League

41:05.160 --> 41:06.400
in one minute.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.000
How is it, Pinso?

41:08.360 --> 41:09.560
-Pinso?
-What?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.400
-Almost.
-How long is left?

41:13.680 --> 41:14.800
One minute.

41:14.960 --> 41:19.040
All of Juventus is watching the game
on a tablet or a smartphone

41:19.160 --> 41:20.400
from the sidelines.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.120
How long is left?

41:27.920 --> 41:28.800
It's over!

41:30.440 --> 41:31.680
It's over!

41:31.800 --> 41:33.160
It's over!

41:33.200 --> 41:36.160
It's over, Naples ends in 1-1.

41:36.600 --> 41:41.320
Juventus qualifies for the UEFA
Champions League again this year.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.160
A very difficult season.

41:45.800 --> 41:46.920
On the last day,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.800
Juventus passes Napoli in the standings.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.680
We must be calm and lucid enough
to win the game.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.840
We need to believe in ourselves!

42:22.280 --> 42:23.640
Let's help each other.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.600
We can't play like this.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.120
We have to fight, guys.
Come on, all together.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.680
Let's give it our all.

42:30.800 --> 42:34.160
Let's win this together,
with humility and sacrifice.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.160
When I think of all the work
of the women and men of Juventus,

42:43.440 --> 42:45.160
we play as 800,

42:45.360 --> 42:47.760
we win as 800 and lose as 800.

42:48.160 --> 42:51.280
Let's keep winning, winning, and winning!

42:51.440 --> 42:53.440
That's all that counts today.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.640
You're at the highest level here,

43:03.080 --> 43:06.280
so, you either ask more of yourself

43:06.680 --> 43:09.160
and learn, or you can't be here.

43:10.640 --> 43:15.040
Juventus has always been synonymous
with discipline, work culture,

43:15.520 --> 43:18.560
victory, and we have
more to win as a club.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.800
You have to fight every day, and prove

43:25.600 --> 43:27.680
that you are there. You have to show

43:27.800 --> 43:30.480
that we never give up. We'll be there.

43:35.160 --> 43:38.440
This is a group of players,

43:38.520 --> 43:42.120
but also of doctors, physiotherapists,
team managers, managers,

43:42.760 --> 43:45.920
used to fighting for the highest goal.

43:49.280 --> 43:52.640
The tradition of Juventus
started in 1897 and continues.

43:52.840 --> 43:55.280
We still win like it was the first day,

43:55.440 --> 43:57.400
and we will keep on winning.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.120
It has certainly been

44:05.520 --> 44:08.440
a stressful year, a tough one,

44:08.760 --> 44:12.480
but it made us all grow,
from the youngest to the oldest.

44:13.320 --> 44:17.160
There's still much to achieve.
We have to prove

44:17.240 --> 44:20.760
that we are a great team
that can compete against anyone.

44:23.400 --> 44:27.920
The end of this season
has been a perfect example.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.080
We managed to achieve a lot

44:31.160 --> 44:33.720
even though the premise was negative.

44:33.800 --> 44:38.440
I'm happy that I shared another two years

44:38.560 --> 44:40.960
with Gigi and Giorgio.

44:41.080 --> 44:45.360
I'll cherish what I learned
from them about life

44:45.440 --> 44:47.480
and soccer all my life.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.800
For me, Leo and Giorgio

44:51.280 --> 44:53.880
are part of a historical group.

44:54.160 --> 44:58.560
The teammates who were

45:00.000 --> 45:03.520
my brothers on the field,

45:03.960 --> 45:07.200
and that'll never change.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.240
Gigi is the person

45:09.680 --> 45:12.240
I've seen the most in the last 15 years.

45:13.040 --> 45:17.080
When Giorgio is healthy,
he's still an effective player,

45:17.880 --> 45:20.400
and I always want players
who can decide games.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.800
He's like an older brother

45:22.880 --> 45:25.560
because he has a special character,

45:26.560 --> 45:29.520
and I love his qualities
and I love his faults.

45:31.720 --> 45:36.000
We've gone through so much together,
Gigi and I will be tied for life,

45:36.080 --> 45:39.280
like with Leo,
like it was with Claudio and Andrea,

45:39.360 --> 45:43.880
but also with the management,
we made history together.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.400
All four of us,

45:45.640 --> 45:48.680
even though Andrea stopped playing,

45:48.880 --> 45:52.360
knew that we had to keep giving

45:52.480 --> 45:55.560
Juventus something more

45:55.640 --> 45:57.640
to reach great goals.

45:57.880 --> 46:01.400
It was our last dance. One way or another,

46:02.200 --> 46:05.440
this was our last dance together,

46:05.600 --> 46:08.560
with all that was ours over the years.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.360
That passion that helps you
overcome challenges.

46:14.440 --> 46:17.200
I was their teammate for many years,

46:17.400 --> 46:20.560
so they see me in a different way.
They really wanted me

46:21.000 --> 46:23.440
to celebrate as a coach.

46:23.520 --> 46:26.960
They gave everything to reach those goals.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.560
The final thought is that

46:31.720 --> 46:33.800
my work ended on a positive note.

46:34.400 --> 46:37.240
I can walk away with dignity,
with no regrets,

46:37.320 --> 46:40.800
happy to have brought the team
to the Champions League.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.560
And with this achievement,
I can sleep peacefully.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.520
