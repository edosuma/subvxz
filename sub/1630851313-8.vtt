00:16.091 --> 00:18.833

00:18.927 --> 00:20.260
Right.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.670

Fair point.

-Yes.

00:34.093 --> 00:36.702
I want to help
with relief efforts.

00:36.853 --> 00:38.612
Since when?

00:38.764 --> 00:41.689
Since people I know reached out
and asked me to.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.191
It's not the first time.

00:43.285 --> 00:46.027
I've always had a reason
to resist, but...

00:46.047 --> 00:47.212
I think I ran out
of those reasons.

00:47.364 --> 00:49.882
Okay, okay,
my head is spinning right now.

00:50.109 --> 00:52.033
-When?
-Soon.

00:52.127 --> 00:53.443

to the hospital first.

00:53.537 --> 00:56.371

on my calendar.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.297
For how long?

00:57.466 --> 00:58.632
A month or two.

00:58.784 --> 01:00.350
Maybe longer.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.188
So are you leaving me?

01:06.292 --> 01:08.975
It's only for a while.
If you want to be mad

01:09.128 --> 01:11.295
at someone, blame my boyfriend.

01:11.313 --> 01:13.463
He introduced me
to a world of folks

01:13.482 --> 01:17.117
who never hesitate
to rush into an emergency.

01:17.986 --> 01:20.162
I think some of that rubbed off.

01:21.473 --> 01:24.166
You know I'm really in love
with you, right?

01:24.827 --> 01:26.460

02:07.703 --> 02:10.520
David is going to Haiti.

02:10.614 --> 02:11.964
Haiti? Why?

02:12.191 --> 02:15.208
Well, he knows some people there
that are doing relief work.

02:15.361 --> 02:17.711
They need doctors.
He wants to help.

02:17.863 --> 02:19.196
And he's leaving next week.

02:19.214 --> 02:20.881
Well, how do you feel
about that?

02:21.033 --> 02:22.624
I'm proud of him.

02:22.718 --> 02:24.518
You know, sad for me.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.889
But before he goes, uh...

02:28.983 --> 02:30.649

What, that you want
to put a ring on it

02:36.064 --> 02:37.823

and you're scared?

02:37.974 --> 02:39.883
No, it's just...

02:39.885 --> 02:41.234
I've been thinking

02:41.328 --> 02:44.496
about being without him
for the next few months,

02:44.723 --> 02:47.833
and I realized that I don't want
to be without him ever.

02:48.727 --> 02:52.153
You know, I want to be with him
for the rest of my life.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.582

without knowing that.

next time, all right?

08:58.113 --> 09:00.280
Thank you. Come on,
let's go see your mom, yeah?

09:00.432 --> 09:02.040
Hold the elevator, please!

09:18.800 --> 09:20.300
You seem awfully quiet.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.894
Thought you'd be happy to be
seeing the last of this place.

09:23.121 --> 09:24.896

-Thanks, Claire.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.175
CLAIRE:
So did you tell Michael
about Haiti?

10:02.327 --> 10:05.136
-How'd he take it?
-About as well as you did.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.497
(Claire chuckles)

10:08.500 --> 10:12.836

14:55.395 --> 14:57.228
It was an explosion
in the maternity ward.

14:57.380 --> 14:58.879
Fire has not been contained.

14:58.973 --> 15:00.881

and let us do our job.

19:04.035 --> 19:05.810
It's not safe in here. Sir!

19:06.037 --> 19:07.370
-It's Rupert.
-Okay, Rupert,

19:07.388 --> 19:09.054
we appreciate your help,
but you must leave.

19:09.207 --> 19:10.373
I'm not leaving without Callie.

19:10.541 --> 19:12.817
Listen to me, it's too dangerous
in here, okay?

19:12.968 --> 19:14.968
I'm not asking you!
I am telling you.

19:15.062 --> 19:17.880
I survived stage-four cancer.

19:17.882 --> 19:20.074
I can survive this.

19:21.903 --> 19:23.219
-Ravi.
-I'll get him.

19:23.237 --> 19:25.738
-Sir, please wait.
<i> -(phone ringing)</i>

19:25.890 --> 19:27.239
Yes.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.241
Dr. Hale, the fire
has breached the fire door

19:29.335 --> 19:31.377
and is entering
the oncology ward.

19:33.231 --> 19:35.581
All nonessentials evacuate now.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.177
I'm staying with this patient.

19:42.498 --> 19:44.473
Then so are we.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.259
All right.

19:47.412 --> 19:49.078
I want all oxygen and anesthesia

19:49.096 --> 19:50.688
to this room
shut off immediately.

19:50.915 --> 19:53.024
Start bagging.

20:01.350 --> 20:04.109
-(Sofia fussing)
<i>-Parker, honey, you doing okay?</i>

20:04.204 --> 20:06.687
-You <i> -(Parker coughs)</i>

20:06.781 --> 20:08.873
<i> Parker?</i>

20:09.024 --> 20:12.785
I put the towels under the door,
but the smoke's still coming in.

20:12.937 --> 20:15.046
Is there water in the room?

20:15.273 --> 20:17.048
<i> A bottle or-or a pitcher?</i>

20:17.199 --> 20:19.533
-Yeah, a pitcher.
<i> -Great.</i>

20:19.552 --> 20:22.294
Pour it on the towel
you placed under the door, okay?

20:22.447 --> 20:24.371
<i> And soak it really well,</i>
<i> okay, baby?</i>

20:24.465 --> 20:27.141
<i> Let me know when you're done.</i>

20:30.396 --> 20:32.146
(coughing)

20:33.882 --> 20:35.399
Done.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.050
Hello? Hello?

20:37.070 --> 20:39.195
-(coughing)
-(phone line beeping)

20:39.888 --> 20:41.322
Hello?

20:43.559 --> 20:45.326
Come on, come on.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.412
Unit 118,
this is Dispatcher Collins.

20:48.489 --> 20:50.564
We've lost connection
with a minor caller

20:50.641 --> 20:51.807
<i> in room 318.</i>

20:51.900 --> 20:53.233
<i> Line is dead.</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:55.536
EDDIE:
Copy that, Dispatch.
We're almost there.

20:55.646 --> 20:57.129
BUCK:
This is us.

20:57.832 --> 20:59.698
Damn, it's bad up here.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.667
(grunting)

21:01.761 --> 21:03.076
EDDIE:
Heading that way,

21:03.096 --> 21:04.911
but this floor is
fully involved.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.747
I told him to take shelter
in the room,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.249
shut the door and seal it
with a towel. Room 318.

21:09.343 --> 21:13.104
BUCK:
We can't go any further
without a hose line.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.233
EDDIE:
Guess these will have to do.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.704
Aah, too hot!
The flames are too high!

21:32.533 --> 21:33.457
(static crackles)

21:33.626 --> 21:35.534
Firefighter Buckley,
Firefighter Diaz,

21:35.686 --> 21:37.611
are you there?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.672
Do you copy?

21:40.466 --> 21:41.874
(coughing, groaning)

21:41.968 --> 21:45.136
<i> Firefighter Diaz, do you copy?</i>

21:45.287 --> 21:47.638
Did you make it to room 318?

21:47.790 --> 21:50.791
There is no 318.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.701
It's gone.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.187
Fire took it.

22:03.305 --> 22:05.323
Copy.

22:09.904 --> 22:11.812
I think you need to take five.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.999
-I'm fine.
-No, just take it anyway.

22:25.586 --> 22:27.970
(exhales)

22:32.760 --> 22:34.093
(beeping)

22:34.245 --> 22:36.228
911. What's your emergency?

22:45.940 --> 22:47.531
ATHENA:
Michael!

22:47.683 --> 22:49.592
Michael!

22:49.610 --> 22:51.594
Athena!

22:51.687 --> 22:52.778
How did you...?

22:52.930 --> 22:54.113
May called me.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.931
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine!

22:55.950 --> 22:58.692
It's David-- he's the one still
inside the burning building.

22:58.861 --> 23:00.711
(frantic chatter)

23:00.880 --> 23:03.172
(siren wailing, horn honking)

23:05.626 --> 23:07.943
LAFD is calling for a mandatory
evac-- we've got about

23:08.036 --> 23:10.779
five minutes before they come in
here and drag us out themselves.

23:10.873 --> 23:12.723
That won't be necessary.
Almost done.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.617
Margins are clear.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.394
(beeping)

23:16.562 --> 23:17.895
He's hemorrhaging.

23:18.046 --> 23:20.789
-Blood pressure's dropping.
-Everything's dropping.

23:20.808 --> 23:21.882
I have to stop the bleeding.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.692
Approaching stroke territory.

23:25.630 --> 23:28.464
Okay, you all need to leave now.
I mean it. Go now.

23:28.482 --> 23:30.816
With all due respect, Doctor,
we leave when you leave.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.727
What do we say?
Faith in science.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.996
And each other.

23:38.859 --> 23:41.293
Hen, over here! Come on!

23:47.501 --> 23:49.927
-Is she alive?
-Callie? Callie?

23:50.988 --> 23:52.838
-(coughing)
-RUPERT: Thank God.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.840
Ravi, get a tourniquet
on that leg.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.082
Callie, your pulse is strong.

23:56.177 --> 23:58.677
Did anything hit y-your neck
or-or your head?

23:58.829 --> 24:00.012
-Don't think so.
-Okay.

24:00.164 --> 24:02.106
Give me some fingers and toes.

24:03.091 --> 24:05.501
Okay, good, good, good.
That's very good.

24:05.594 --> 24:07.427
I'm gonna get this collar
on your neck,

24:07.521 --> 24:09.171
bandage your wound and get you
the hell out of here, okay?

24:09.264 --> 24:10.931
So glad we found you, Callie.

24:11.025 --> 24:12.675
When that explosion went off--

24:12.693 --> 24:14.935
Can't believe you're here.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.012
You're not a patient anymore.

24:17.105 --> 24:19.531
Yeah, well,
I got used to this place.

24:19.684 --> 24:21.292
I'm not leaving just yet.

24:30.361 --> 24:32.303
(creaking)

24:35.549 --> 24:37.725
Get her out of here.

24:38.627 --> 24:40.978
-Get out!
-(grunting)

24:45.543 --> 24:47.151
Rupert?

24:49.880 --> 24:51.489
(grunts)

24:51.565 --> 24:53.407
(panting)

24:55.553 --> 24:56.660
You okay?

24:56.887 --> 24:59.722
This kid,
he was eight years old.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.499
And his sister?

25:01.650 --> 25:03.225
I know.

25:03.244 --> 25:05.002
What are we supposed
to do with that?

25:05.229 --> 25:08.714
We put it away
and we save the next one.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.553

25:49.364 --> 25:52.258
No, but I think he was.

25:54.128 --> 25:57.388
Is there an 81E in the hospital?

25:58.966 --> 26:01.300
Yes. On the fifth floor.

26:01.452 --> 26:04.044
He was reading,
he was reading a reflection!

His pulse is stable,

-(Sofia crying)

26:35.761 --> 26:37.511

Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

27:03.030 --> 27:05.247
Not now.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.959
You don't need to be in here.

27:10.037 --> 27:13.689
Well, I just thought you might
like to know the kids are okay.

27:13.707 --> 27:16.783
The little boy Parker
and his baby sister.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.094
They found them.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.955
-What?
-The little boy.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.699
He gave you
the wrong room number.

27:23.717 --> 27:25.868
What-what do you...?

27:25.961 --> 27:27.719
How is that possible?

27:27.872 --> 27:29.204
He called back.

27:29.297 --> 27:32.465
He saw the numbers
in a reflection in the hall.

27:32.559 --> 27:34.059
You figured that out?

27:34.211 --> 27:37.045
A firefighter did
when I radioed him.

27:37.139 --> 27:39.139
So I guess you could say
this was a group effort.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.450
-You were part of that, too.
-(sobs)

27:43.478 --> 27:45.404

28:06.260 --> 28:08.686
I need as much help over here
as possible.

Let's go, let's go, let's go!

MICHAEL:
Athena.

28:27.114 --> 28:28.597
Anything?

28:28.690 --> 28:30.282
No.

28:30.434 --> 28:32.292
Nothing.

28:33.287 --> 28:34.712
Bobby!

28:34.863 --> 28:37.131
Um, excuse me.

28:37.866 --> 28:39.216
Where's David?

28:39.367 --> 28:41.610
Have you seen him? I-I think
he's in one of the ORs.

28:41.628 --> 28:43.036
Well, he should've been
evacuated by now.

28:43.130 --> 28:44.813
What's he still doing in there?

28:44.873 --> 28:46.372
He was in the middle of surgery

28:46.392 --> 28:47.891
-when the explosion happened.
-He didn't come out.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.042
I think he's still in there.

28:49.211 --> 28:50.635
You got to find him, Bobby.

28:50.730 --> 28:51.803
I will see what I can do.

28:51.956 --> 28:53.897
He can't die on me.

28:54.049 --> 28:55.733
He is not gonna die.

29:03.150 --> 29:06.559
He's lost 250 cc's and counting.

29:06.728 --> 29:08.078
Let's have blood on standby.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.563
-On it.
-There's the aneurysm.

29:10.732 --> 29:11.823
It's already ruptured.

29:11.976 --> 29:14.251
I need a clip
to stop the bleeding.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.921
Generator failure.
We are on battery backup.

29:18.832 --> 29:21.508
Start a timer.
We've got 20 minutes.

29:32.997 --> 29:35.105
Internal bleeding,
compact fracture.

29:35.298 --> 29:37.757
She lost a lot of blood,
but her vitals are good.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.668
What about him?

29:39.761 --> 29:42.362
Broken neck. No signs of life.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.127
Hey.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.279
You okay?

29:59.373 --> 30:00.947
I was supposed to save him.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.008
Not the other way around.

30:04.044 --> 30:06.762
You did everything
you could, Ravi.

30:12.961 --> 30:14.870
I don't see how you do this.

30:15.039 --> 30:17.039
I have faith in Bobby.

30:17.057 --> 30:19.316
And so should you.

30:29.144 --> 30:32.162
-David.
-I can't now, Bobby.

30:32.314 --> 30:34.072
We need to evacuate now.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.058
If I walk out of this room,
this man dies,

30:36.076 --> 30:37.650
and I can't let that happen.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.911
I promised his wife.

30:40.064 --> 30:42.581
And I promised your husband.

30:42.733 --> 30:44.675
Michael's not my husband.

30:44.826 --> 30:47.177
Well, he wants to be.

30:48.255 --> 30:49.996
He's standing
outside this hospital

30:50.015 --> 30:51.515
right now
with a ring in his pocket--

30:51.742 --> 30:54.518
or maybe a watch, I'm not sure--

30:54.745 --> 30:56.687
waiting to propose.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.005
(sighs)

30:59.099 --> 31:01.841
-I have to finish.
-I'll give you ten minutes.

Rupert?

38:13.274 --> 38:17.961
I spent practically my entire
childhood in hospitals.

38:18.188 --> 38:22.173
Those doctors and nurses
become your family.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.304

38:27.455 --> 38:30.140
It's not exactly fun party talk.

38:30.367 --> 38:34.202
It was chemo on the weekends
instead of soccer tournaments.

38:34.220 --> 38:37.814
But those people
cheered me on just the same.

38:37.891 --> 38:40.375
They saved my life.

38:40.468 --> 38:43.135
So I get why he ran back
into the building.

38:43.229 --> 38:45.447
To pay it forward.

38:47.217 --> 38:50.410
I guess
that's why you do it, too.

39:04.584 --> 39:06.492

You know, I-I can't save lives,

40:20.085 --> 40:23.211

40:26.499 --> 40:30.835
Now, Harry has already given me
his approval,

40:30.929 --> 40:32.987
and I hope that you would, too.

40:32.989 --> 40:34.822

Oh.

40:38.453 --> 40:41.187

40:43.667 --> 40:45.925
All of you, really.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.093
You know, with, uh,
my brain tumor

40:48.113 --> 40:50.672
and then the pandemic
and-and then my job,

40:50.690 --> 40:53.283
you know, at times,
I-I really felt a...

40:53.434 --> 40:56.411
(exhales)
Felt a little lost.

40:57.681 --> 40:59.180
But last night,

40:59.199 --> 41:01.349
I watched people come together

41:01.367 --> 41:05.353
and save someone
that they didn't even know.

41:05.446 --> 41:07.797
More than one.

41:07.949 --> 41:11.617
