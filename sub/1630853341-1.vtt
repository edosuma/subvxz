WEBVTT

01:28.463 --> 01:29.631
Oh fuck.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.813
Donald Trump
We want products
made by our own workers

01:44.896 --> 01:47.273
in our factories,
stamped with those

01:47.357 --> 01:48.858
four magnificent words...

01:52.111 --> 01:53.696
Trump
...made in the USA.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.365
Are the kids here?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.617
The kids? No, Michael.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.202
Let's go!

02:05.250 --> 02:06.668
Alright, you fucker.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.338
911
Durham 911,
what's your emergency?

02:10.421 --> 02:11.756
1810 Cedar street.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.507
-Please.
-What's wrong?

02:12.590 --> 02:14.092
My wife, she had an accident.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.218
She's still breathing

02:15.301 --> 02:16.302
What kind of accident?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.470
She fell down the stairs.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.055
She's still breathing.
Please come.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.598
-- Is she conscious?
-- What?

02:20.682 --> 02:21.724
-Is she conscious?
-No, she's not conscious.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.434
How many stairs
did she fall down?

02:23.518 --> 02:24.727
-- What?
-- How many stairs?

02:24.811 --> 02:25.728
15, 20, I don't know.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.856
Please get somebody here
right away. Please.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.065
...dispatching the ambulance

02:29.149 --> 02:30.483
while I ask you questions.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.737
911 operator: Durham 911,
what is your emergency?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.739
Where are they?

02:36.823 --> 02:39.242
This is 1810 Cedar Street.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.995
She's not breathing. Please.
Please, will you hurry up.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.455
911 operator:
Sir, calm down,
they're on the way.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.167
Can you tell me for sure
she's not breathing.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.918
Sir. Sir?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.309
That party was lame.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.812
I hope no one saw us
walk out together.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.443
Are your parents gonna be up?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.695
Yeah. But they won't
even see us come in.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.780
-Okay.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.544
Todd?

03:33.087 --> 03:34.213
Todd, wake up!

03:35.840 --> 03:37.800
What the fuck?

03:39.594 --> 03:40.803
The fuck!

03:54.734 --> 03:56.444
Hey, wh-what's going on here?

03:56.527 --> 03:56.986
Do you live here?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.030
No, my, my parents do.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.239
Wh-what's going on?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.158
-Have you been drinking?
-What?

04:02.241 --> 04:02.992
No. I mean,
yeah, we just came

04:03.076 --> 04:05.161
from a Christmas party
down the street.

04:05.244 --> 04:07.121
-Todd? Todd?
-She family, too?

04:07.205 --> 04:08.665
-No, no, I'm--
-No, she's one
of my friends.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.999
Can you please
just let me in.

04:10.083 --> 04:10.583
Alright, but just you.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.002
Thank you.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.172
Dad! Kathleen!

04:16.255 --> 04:17.131
Hey.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.675
Hey, what's going on?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.969
Hey, what's going on?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.930
Is this your home, sir?

04:24.013 --> 04:26.224
-Yeah, wha-what happened?

04:26.307 --> 04:28.059
Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!

04:28.142 --> 04:30.979
Dad, what happened?
What happened

04:31.062 --> 04:32.981
Are you okay?
What happened to Kathleen?

04:33.064 --> 04:34.482
Kathleen...

04:36.567 --> 04:38.361
-Something's wrong.
-Dad, what happened?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.071
Something's wrong, god!

04:40.154 --> 04:40.571
Oh my god.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.541
-Is she dead?
-I'm afraid so, son.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.836
What, what happened?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.254
Your dad called 911,

04:56.337 --> 04:58.214
said his wife
fell down the stairs.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.551
She... she fell?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.511
Ohh.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.139
This is, um...

05:06.222 --> 05:09.058
Is there a way
to bring her back?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.226
No. She's gone.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.239
Dad.

05:27.160 --> 05:27.702
Kathleen's dead, Dad.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.329
-No.
-Dad! Dad!

05:32.206 --> 05:33.124
-Dad.
-No! No!

05:33.207 --> 05:36.544
Sir! Get him off her, now!

05:36.627 --> 05:38.463
No!

05:38.546 --> 05:40.506
Sir, you're gonna have to-- sir!

05:40.590 --> 05:42.050
Okay, sir,
you need to let go.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.259
Son, he's gonna have
to let go.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.512
-Sir, now!

05:46.596 --> 05:48.931
Dad. Dad, you have to let go.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.808
Please, Dad.
You have to let go.

05:50.892 --> 05:51.934
Sit him down!

05:56.355 --> 05:57.940
I got you, I got you.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.860
I've got you, I've got you.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.279
Officer! Yeah, I need
some help in here.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.781
Can I get some assistance,
please?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.911
Is that your mother?

06:09.994 --> 06:12.371
It's, uh,
it's my stepmother, yeah.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.457
Sarge, what's your ETA?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.001
-Copy, I'm with the husband
and stepson

06:17.085 --> 06:18.961
in the kitchen
standing by.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.505
-Coroner's en route.
-What happens now?

06:20.588 --> 06:22.381
We've got
some more guys coming.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.341
You and your dad
should just stay there.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.552
When is the last time
you saw your mom?

06:26.636 --> 06:26.969
I saw her tonight.

06:28.429 --> 06:32.308
I'm really worried about him.
Jesus Christ!

06:32.391 --> 06:34.268
Officer
Can someone quiet
those dogs down?

06:34.352 --> 06:35.853
Were they arguing?

06:35.937 --> 06:37.688
No, they weren't arguing,
they were, they were drinking,

06:37.772 --> 06:39.023
they were laughing.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.820
Do you guys have, like,
a grief counselor or something?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.363
We can make a request.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.990
If you don't think
he can control himself,

06:48.074 --> 06:49.158
-you can go outside...
-Can't control himself?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.993
...and get some air.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.787
Here. Let's,
let's get you cleaned up.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.414
Come on.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.041
I got you. I got you.

06:57.125 --> 06:57.875
I got you.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.423
What...
what happened, Dad? Huh?

07:06.759 --> 07:09.679
Uh, we were outside...

07:09.762 --> 07:11.556
we were...

07:15.768 --> 07:17.270
and then she came in...

07:19.272 --> 07:21.983
and then I came in, uh...

07:22.817 --> 07:24.485
and I found her,

07:28.447 --> 07:30.950
Come on, Dad, let's, let's
get you cleaned up. Here.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.412
Alright, Sarge, in here.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.747
That's him by the sink, sir.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.500
I'm Sergeant Borden.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.086
I need you to stop
doing that right now.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.546
Turn off the water, please.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.883
Okay, fine, but I've asked
for a grief counselor.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.593
Is there a grief counselor
coming or not?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.179
Sergeant
Mr. Peterson,

07:51.262 --> 07:52.513
the house has now
been declared a crime scene.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.268
We'll need to keep you all
here until further notice.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.794
-Ahh!
-Oh!

08:26.047 --> 08:27.423
Okay, come on.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.217
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.178
Okay.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.804
Just a little for you.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.099
Thank you!

08:37.183 --> 08:38.100
A little more for me.
Just a little, yeah.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.436
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.563
Okay.
Now speech.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.940
-Speech, speech, speech.
-No.

08:46.275 --> 08:49.570
Well... thank you, Mom.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.659
For... for everything

08:54.742 --> 09:00.623
and for that,
like, amazing note.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.918
I'm expecting you and Dad
to visit me in San Francisco.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.294
Yes, of course.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.129
-Of course.
-I love you.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.131
Wait, you're,
you're starting without me?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.841
There you are. Yes!
And we're about to eat too.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.635
You'd think he'd get home
from the gym on time

09:12.718 --> 09:13.552
at least once.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.181
Dad, you still smell.
Go have a shower.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.307
-I'll save you a glass.
-Hey, Dad?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.644
Okay, Margaret, go get your,
uh, your mother's China

09:21.727 --> 09:22.478
and grab the good
linen napkins from upstairs,

09:22.562 --> 09:26.190
because this is
a special occasion.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.234
Her baby girl
is going to college.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.319
Oh!

09:30.403 --> 09:32.613
-I love you!
-Oh, I want some!

09:34.991 --> 09:36.242
Alright.
Go upstairs already.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.702
You're gonna make me cry.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.204
And get your brother.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.373
Todd!

09:42.456 --> 09:43.874
Todd!

09:45.209 --> 09:47.503
Don't give me that look.
And get the salad bowl.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.507
You know, you never
wrote me a special note

09:51.591 --> 09:53.050
when I went away.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.719
Yeah. Well, it's different,
you know that.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.680
Plus...

09:57.763 --> 10:00.725
I don't overshare with them
the way I do with you.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.642
-They don't know my pain.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.276
Todd! Todd!

10:10.359 --> 10:12.862
What? I'm on the phone!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.905
Dinner's almost ready.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.949
No, Nate, what I'm saying
is that we could be making

10:17.033 --> 10:18.242
so much more on this
back-to-school stuff.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.369
Nate
We should just bully
them into buying stuff.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.996
Right. Right, exactly.

10:22.079 --> 10:22.538
I mean, it could be funny,
even like...

10:24.498 --> 10:27.001
a bag with wheels
is for losers.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.627
And then these are
the best backpacks to buy

10:28.711 --> 10:29.045
and then links
where to buy them.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.047
-Hey.
-Right.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.340
Oh. Hey.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.508
Hey, one sec, Nate.
What's up?

10:34.592 --> 10:36.385
Dinner's ready.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.471
Alright, I'm just
finishing a call.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.389
I'll be in my office.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.435
Nate-Nate, we got
this dinner for Martha.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.270
Let me, let me
call you back later.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.591
-Todd, get the cup.
-Oh, okay.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.302
-Oh!

11:18.386 --> 11:20.346
-How was that?
-That was...

11:21.430 --> 11:22.807
You got to, you know...

11:27.311 --> 11:28.521
Alright.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.649
So to continue
the tradition

11:31.732 --> 11:34.443
started by Uncle Bill
and my dear old papa,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.779
what the Brits call
"passin' the loving cup"...

11:36.862 --> 11:40.741
-...but with a Peterson twist.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.414
-Kathleen.
-Yes.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.125
-You first.
-Oh god, okay.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.293
Pass her down.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.670
Okay.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.131
Um, I'd like
to make a toast

11:56.382 --> 12:00.636
to... our beautiful
daughter Martha.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.515
No matter what color
your hair is...

12:04.598 --> 12:05.808
How about blue?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.852
Blue, green. Whatever.
-Good idea.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.312
You are beautiful.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.940
And you're my daughter.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.527
Every day is going
to be an adventure.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.907
So always stop
and think and appreciate

12:21.991 --> 12:23.325
when you're having
a really good day.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.326
You need to think
to yourself,

12:24.410 --> 12:25.327
"This is one of
the happiest days of my life,"

12:25.411 --> 12:28.831
so you can retrieve it

12:28.914 --> 12:30.166
and bring it to the front
of your mind.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.668
And treasure it.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.838
Lean on it when
you're having a bad time.

12:35.921 --> 12:40.050
Because there are
so many better days ahead.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.346
-To Martha.
-To Martha.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.266
-Okay, here.
-Yep.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.312
To... Mom.

12:52.354 --> 12:56.066
I know we'll be gone,

12:56.150 --> 12:58.444
but we're always here
for you...

12:58.527 --> 13:00.196
the way that
you've been for us.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.614
Thank you.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.199
-I love you.
-I love you.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.658
-To Mom.
-To Mom.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.076
Kathleen!

13:08.120 --> 13:08.704
I'll go.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.791
-Got it?
-Yeah.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.378
To Dad.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.547
Uh...

13:20.591 --> 13:22.301
Thank you for always
being there for me.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.598
May you succeed
in politics

13:27.681 --> 13:30.392
the way you succeeded
in writing.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.061
-To Dad.
-Dad.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.312
-To Michael.
-Thank you.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.900
To my brother Clayton.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.735
I know the last few years
haven't been the easiest
for you--

13:39.818 --> 13:42.279
Todd, Todd, we don't talk
about spring break, right?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.406
Alright.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.243
Um, I'm so proud of you.

13:49.036 --> 13:49.745
Back to school
and everything.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.832
To Clayton.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.584
-And to Becky. To Becky.
-And Becky.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.211
-Clayton.
-Becky.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.420
-Caitlin.
-Thank you.

14:01.006 --> 14:01.799
Um...

14:03.759 --> 14:08.597
to a wonderful
school year for Martha.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.599
-That toast sucked.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.936
Okay. 'Cause your speech
was amazing.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.063
I hope somebody
recorded it for posterity.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.693
Martha, I love you.

14:20.776 --> 14:24.405
I hope you have
the best next year.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.407
You'll be dancing
on a big stage someday.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.366
-Love you, Caitlin.
-Love you.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.452
-- To Martha again.
-- To Martha again.

14:30.536 --> 14:30.869
Mike's turn.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.420
Hmm.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.922
Michael, what's going on?

14:42.006 --> 14:42.339
Are you speechless?

14:42.423 --> 14:44.550
No. No. Never.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.885
-Yeah, never.
-Okay.

14:49.388 --> 14:53.183
This toast is
to all of us.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.145
Now, I think there are not
many families--

14:56.228 --> 14:57.271
Well, I know, I know
there are not many families

14:57.354 --> 14:59.565
out there like us.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.317
We're not perfect,
god knows,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.861
but we stick together.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.406
And we love each other.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.325
And so...

15:10.367 --> 15:13.329
to us.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.246
-To us.
-To the Petersons.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.831
-The Petersons.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.374
-To the Ratliffs.
-And the Atwater.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.215
Mm.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.230
Hello?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.900
Uncle Bill.

15:43.651 --> 15:43.984
Kathleen's dead.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.324
Bill?

15:54.286 --> 15:55.871
Bill, are you there?

15:56.580 --> 15:59.124
What happened?

15:59.208 --> 15:59.917
Dad was outside and, uh...

16:02.002 --> 16:03.462
when he, um...

16:04.963 --> 16:07.466
when he came in, he found her
at the bottom of the stairs.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.929
I think she was pretty
shitfaced and fell.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.098
Oh god.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.933
And they've sequestered us
in Dad's office.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.059
I mean, they won't even let
my friend go pee by herself.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.104
They're, they're calling
this whole thing a crime scene.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.815
Is this normal?

16:22.898 --> 16:24.733
It's absolutely not normal.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.362
Kathleen had
a meeting this morning.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.364
We should let them know.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.615
Dad's in there
talking to himself.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.868
Tell Mike
not to say anything.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.162
Anybody wants to talk
to either of you guys,

16:37.246 --> 16:38.038
tell 'em your attorney
is on the way.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.999
Okay.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.751
Don't-don't don't say a word.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.170
Don't say a word.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.297
Is there somewhere
you guys can go?

16:47.381 --> 16:50.134
I mean, we could probably
go to Larry's next door.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.761
If they let us.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.929
I'm going to get on
the first flight I can.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.348
I'll get you guys
out of there.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.767
Love you.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.645
Okay. I love you too.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.912
Who else is here?

17:18.996 --> 17:21.957
Michael, the son,
and his friend.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.751
Did anyone make
a statement?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.836
Nothing official,
but the son's friend said

17:25.919 --> 17:26.962
she was here earlier.

17:27.045 --> 17:27.671
I asked if she witnessed
any fighting

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
or anything like that.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.842
She said
everything seemed fine.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.595
She didn't actually
see her, though.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.099
Said she heard the wife
laughing in the other room,

17:39.183 --> 17:40.142
but that's it.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.355
Alright.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.324
Mr. Peterson,

17:55.407 --> 17:57.159
I'm Lieutenant Investigator
Art Holland.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.328
This is a warrant granting
the Durham Police Department

17:59.411 --> 18:02.581
and all related agencies
the right to search your home

18:02.664 --> 18:04.166
and your premises
for any evidence

18:04.249 --> 18:06.877
related to the death
of Mrs. Kathleen Peterson.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.712
Do you understand?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.384
Please instruct everyone
they're allowed

18:14.468 --> 18:16.637
to re-enter the home
and commence the search.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.973
We will need your car keys
for your vehicles,

18:20.057 --> 18:22.059
and we'll need to collect
your clothing for evidence now.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.937
Alright, we're good to go.

18:25.020 --> 18:25.646
All teams move in.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.042
Hello.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.921
Uh, morning, Jim,
I'm sorry to call you so early.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.465
That's okay.
What's up?

18:53.549 --> 18:57.010
Art -
Around- 40,
a husband calls 911,

18:57.094 --> 18:57.886
saying his wife
fall down the stairs

18:57.970 --> 19:00.055
but was still breathing,
hurry up.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.891
Husband calls back
five minutes later

19:02.975 --> 19:04.643
checking in on an ETA,

19:04.726 --> 19:06.228
says she's
not breathing anymore.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.439
Paramedics arrive
a few minutes after that.

19:09.523 --> 19:13.068
They check her out.
Report she's
six millimeters dilated.

19:13.151 --> 19:16.238
EMT says she ain't had no life
in her heart at all for a while.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.782
Medical Well,
I don't feel any fractures,

19:18.866 --> 19:21.201
but there are
considerable wounds.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.327
If this was a beating,

19:22.411 --> 19:24.079
I'd say you're looking
for something long and hollow.

19:26.164 --> 19:29.418
Sergeant Borden calls me,
wakes me up,

19:29.501 --> 19:30.794
tells me I should
get down to the scene

19:30.878 --> 19:32.170
because there's
a lot of blood.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.131
No sign of forced entry

19:34.214 --> 19:37.593
and, and it don't look
like an accident.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.682
Jim
How much blood?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.185
Like the woman's
head exploded.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.022
Where is this?

19:50.105 --> 19:53.108
Uh, Forest Hills.

19:53.192 --> 19:53.984
I imagine you're gonna be
getting calls about this

19:54.067 --> 19:55.944
when you walk
through the door.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.654
The husband is
Michael Peterson

19:57.738 --> 19:59.823
and the deceased
is his wife Kathleen.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.577
Michael Peterson,
Michael Peterson?

20:03.660 --> 20:07.039
Oh yeah.
That's why I wanted
to give you the heads up.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.002
And you say there is
no sign of a break-in?

20:12.085 --> 20:15.130
Big house,
but don't look like it.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.424
Sounds like no one was here
except for him and his wife.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.433
Thanks for
the heads up, Art.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.142
-Alright, Jim.
-Mm-hmm.

20:29.019 --> 20:29.186
Bye now.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.109
Officer, can I take
my car now, the Subaru?

20:36.193 --> 20:37.527
Yup, you're all clear.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.820
You sure you don't want
to make a statement?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.280
I told you, no.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.436
-Woman Hello.
-Candace?

21:16.191 --> 21:17.275
Hello?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.528
Is Mark there?

21:19.611 --> 21:20.862
No, he just left for work.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.364
Uh, I need
his car phone then.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.700
Is everything okay?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.284
I just need,
need to speak with Mark.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.205
Alright.
It's, uh, 804-554-3212.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.834
I'll call you back. Okay?
Is that okay?

21:33.917 --> 21:35.752
Is everything okay?
This feels strange.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.629
Please, I really can't talk.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.880
I'll just--
I'll call you back.

21:40.966 --> 21:41.216
Fuck!

21:59.526 --> 22:01.528
-Mark Hello.
-Mark, it's Mike.

22:01.611 --> 22:02.404
Oh, hey, Mike.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.365
How are you doing
this morning?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.784
I couldn't tell Candace.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.705
Kathleen's dead.
She fell down the stairs.
She's dead.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.582
Jesus, Mike. What--

22:13.665 --> 22:15.709
I need you
to tell Candace and Lori.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.086
Of course. Yeah, uh...

22:18.170 --> 22:19.421
-I'm so sorry--
-Okay, thanks, Mark.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.014
You let me know
if you need anything.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.265
Thanks, Larry.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.896
Dad, have some.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.272
-What?
-Have some.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.523
Uh, no.

22:41.985 --> 22:42.319
Give me those numbers.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.114
I'm going to call
the girls for you.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.034
Yeah.

22:49.117 --> 22:52.037
But don't just call them.
Like, I want someone there

22:52.120 --> 22:54.247
to tell them, you know.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.500
Yeah, I'll call the
sorority house for Caitlin.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.168
I'll try the dorms
for Margaret.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.297
Shit, Margaret.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.802
Is today the ninth?

23:09.971 --> 23:11.807
It's Margaret's
birthday tomorrow.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.238
Oh god,
I hate this, I hate this.

23:26.321 --> 23:26.988
You have no idea, Carol,

23:27.072 --> 23:30.200
how much I hate this.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.160
I mean, I come into the office,
and I don't know

23:32.244 --> 23:33.370
if I'm going to find
an envelope on my desk.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.247
And when I see it,
my heart just...

23:36.123 --> 23:37.999
sinks.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.794
Because inside
is this damn list.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.671
And it's just names,
there's no reason.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.631
I know.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.508
-I know.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.512
I just don't understand.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.223
Did I make a mistake?
Was my work not good?

23:53.306 --> 23:56.518
No. God, no,
it's not that.

23:56.601 --> 24:01.148
It's just the merger
hasn't played out as planned.

24:01.231 --> 24:01.940
And Nortel can't afford
the redundancy.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.192
It's that simple.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.073
The severance package
is okay.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.408
I mean, it'll give you
time to look.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.369
Is Eric still at Glassco?

24:16.329 --> 24:16.580
For now.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.044
Look, it's going
to be okay. I promise.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.379
And if anything
changes here--

24:24.462 --> 24:25.672
Fuck it.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.387
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.525
Well, I'm running very simply

24:45.609 --> 24:47.402
because I'm sick of seeing

24:47.485 --> 24:50.322
what these bozos in City Hall
are doing to this town.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.574
So does this
mean we can't expect
any more books from you?

24:52.657 --> 24:54.826
Oh no, I'll always be a writer.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.579
I just finished
my latest column, uh, today,

24:57.662 --> 25:00.332
as a matter of fact about
the Bozo DA Jim Hardin

25:00.415 --> 25:01.750
going after bingo halls
instead of real criminals.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.461
Prior to writing his weekly
column for "The Sun,"

25:04.544 --> 25:07.797
Michael Peterson was
best known as a novelist,

25:07.881 --> 25:09.674
-finding success
writing war novels.
-Oh, and still is.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.761
So I have to ask,
because it's going to come up.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.763
You ran for mayor in '99.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.473
-Oh god, here we go.
-Yes.

25:16.556 --> 25:17.891
-Yeah. Motherfucker.
-You were in the lead

25:17.974 --> 25:18.934
and then a story came out
that you had lied

25:19.017 --> 25:22.103
about receiving
a Purple Heart in Vietnam.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.272
It arguably cost you
the mayorship,

25:24.356 --> 25:26.107
and you hadn't
in fact injured

25:26.191 --> 25:27.609
your leg in combat,
as you claim.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.111
No, I-I-I had been injured

25:30.195 --> 25:31.821
in a car accident
while on duty.

25:31.905 --> 25:36.451
But your injury
was not sustained in combat.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.286
Uh, no, no, it wasn't.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.998
Look, I, I have faith

25:42.082 --> 25:45.085
that the voters will see past
that hiccup in my character.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.628
My opponent,
Howard Clement,

25:46.711 --> 25:47.879
is not going

25:47.963 --> 25:49.923
to bring about
change in Durham.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.299
-I will.
-You... putz!

25:51.383 --> 25:54.135
There will be
several debates in
the coming months...

25:54.219 --> 25:55.637
-Papa needs practice.

25:57.305 --> 25:58.974
...before hitting the polls
November sixth.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.439
Hmm.

26:06.439 --> 26:06.523
Hello.

26:08.066 --> 26:08.984
Hey.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.528
Uh, I'm, I'm good. You?

26:13.863 --> 26:17.284
So are we, uh,
we set for the fifth?

26:18.952 --> 26:20.537
Oh, well, you're coming
from, uh, from where again?

26:22.914 --> 26:23.790
Yeah, well, uh,

26:23.873 --> 26:26.543
either the, the hotel
by the airport there

26:26.626 --> 26:28.420
or, or at my place.

26:30.505 --> 26:31.589
Mm-hmm.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.009
Yeah.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.011
Well, you ready
to get that ass pounded?

26:39.306 --> 26:41.766
Hmm.
Well, alright, then.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.522
Hey, Mike?
Can you give me
a hand with dinner?

26:56.906 --> 26:58.199
I kept an eye
on the stock market today.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.994
Nortel was holding steady.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.245
That's a good sign.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.664
Mm, it's positive.
Yeah.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.334
As long as the company keeps
its head above water.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.212
I mean, you'd think
with all I've built there,

27:11.296 --> 27:13.048
I'd be secure,
but who knows.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.717
We're fine, Kathleen.
We're fine.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.056
Maybe we should let
Essy go for a while

27:21.139 --> 27:23.308
and save some money.
Hmm?

27:23.391 --> 27:24.726
Shouldn't be too hard
to keep the house clean

27:24.809 --> 27:26.353
-without the kids around.
-Hm.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.346
Medical
We've got blood embedded
under the nails.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.640
There were no defensive
wounds on the husband.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.559
-It could be her own.
-Hm.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.103
We've got something
between the fingers.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.188
Can I get the tweezers?

28:10.271 --> 28:10.814
Here you go.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.196
Medical
Looks like a pine needle.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.114
Pine needle?

28:19.197 --> 28:22.367
Bag it for evidence.

28:22.450 --> 28:22.826
Okay.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.754
Medical
Looks like this is her own hair.

28:36.714 --> 28:37.674
Let's bag it and test it.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.138
Feel this.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.973
Feel this gently.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.016
Gently.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.646
This is
the superior cornu
of the left thyroid.

28:51.729 --> 28:54.732
Until I get in there
I can't say for sure but

28:54.816 --> 28:56.985
I'm guessing she
didn't die right away.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.945
She struggled.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.131
Medical
Gentle.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.685
Uncle Bill's here, Dad.

29:30.768 --> 29:32.562
Clayton is pulling up now.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.191
I'm so sorry.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.276
I'm so sorry.

29:40.987 --> 29:41.946
Okay.

29:48.495 --> 29:48.745
Mike.

29:53.333 --> 29:53.833
Uh, I'm gonna...

29:55.627 --> 29:57.712
ask you
this question and...

30:01.883 --> 30:04.719
no matter what the answer is,
it stays in this room.

30:04.802 --> 30:05.803
Jesus Christ.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.309
-No.
-I'm sorry, I'm...

30:13.102 --> 30:14.646
I mean, I don't know
why I even...

30:17.690 --> 30:19.150
From what you've told me,

30:20.318 --> 30:22.153
it sounds like
they think you did,

30:22.237 --> 30:25.323
so we, we need
to get you a lawyer.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.992
Can't you represent him?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.827
No, I-I-I do estates.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.037
I don't do criminal law.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.747
I certainly can't do
criminal law in Durham.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.834
How about Larry?

30:36.918 --> 30:39.963
I don't think
Larry's tough enough.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.507
What about, um, the guy

30:42.590 --> 30:46.219
the one you considered

30:46.302 --> 30:47.387
before Clay went away
for spring break.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.889
-Oh, David Rudolf?
-Yeah.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.307
Fuck, Bill.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.434
He's the kind of guy
you get when you're guilty.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.269
Well, he's,
he's, he's smart.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.813
He's really smart.

30:56.896 --> 30:59.065
He, he, he's not
one of those,

30:59.148 --> 31:00.441
you know,
good ol' boys,

31:00.525 --> 31:02.277
like so many
of the guys down here.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.031
Have you told the girls?

31:07.115 --> 31:10.285
Todd called the school.
There's someone there.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.328
-Shit.

31:12.412 --> 31:12.787
The cake.

31:15.873 --> 31:18.585
I need you to go get
a cake for Margaret.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.295
What do you mean?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.633
It's the funeral home.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.013
Thank you.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.222
Hello?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.476
I need you to get
a cake for Margaret.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.185
I'm going to stay here
with Dad.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.270
No, seriously.
Not right now.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.647
You're my kid brother,
don't tell me what to do.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.274
I'm not telling you
what to do, Clay.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.360
I'm asking for
some help here. Please.

31:44.444 --> 31:44.861
Yeah. Alright.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.032
Don't fucking
snap at me like that.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.078
I was the one that was
there and saw Kathleen
all fucking dead

31:54.162 --> 31:55.496
and fucking covered
in blood and shit.

31:55.580 --> 31:55.830
Alright, alright!

31:57.999 --> 31:59.334
I've kept my shit together.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.044
Alright, I get it.
I'm sorry, man.

32:18.561 --> 32:21.648
The, uh...
funeral home said that

32:21.731 --> 32:24.025
the autopsy was
more thorough than expected.

32:24.108 --> 32:24.942
Jesus Christ.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.945
Just as soon as they
started working on her,

32:28.029 --> 32:29.572
the police came back.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.241
Apparently,
the cops found an, uh,

32:33.368 --> 32:35.244
open condom
in your bedroom.

32:36.204 --> 32:40.124
And they decided
to perform a rape test.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.044
A rape test?

32:43.961 --> 32:46.673
What condom?
We didn't use condoms.

32:51.678 --> 32:52.095
It's a witch hunt.

32:55.264 --> 32:57.058
Kathleen said it.
She said, "Mike,

32:57.141 --> 33:00.520
"stop going after City Hall,
the DA, and the cops.

33:00.603 --> 33:00.895
It's gonna
bite you in the ass."

33:03.856 --> 33:06.776
Revenge, Bill,
that's what this is.

33:08.986 --> 33:10.863
There were
35 total cuts,

33:10.947 --> 33:12.949
wounds, and contusions
on her body.

33:13.032 --> 33:16.994
Seven lacerations alone
on the posterior scalp.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.750
The rape test
came back negative.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.586
No bruising or contusions
around the vagina or anus.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.965
Chief Medical
What do you think about
the broken superior cornu

33:29.048 --> 33:30.258
of the left thyroid?

33:30.341 --> 33:33.761
Could indicate strangulation,
but it's not conclusive.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.432
Now, what I
can't explain is

33:37.515 --> 33:40.727
why there are
no skull fractures.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.437
That's what you would
normally see in a beating.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.274
You didn't put in
the cause of death?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.109
I did.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.444
She bled out.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.946
Without skull fracture,
blunt force trauma--

33:52.029 --> 33:55.408
Someone holding something
caused the impact

33:55.491 --> 33:56.284
to make these wounds.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.786
That's not for me
to conclude in here.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.788
You think the murder weapon
just flew through the air

34:00.872 --> 34:02.373
held by no one?

34:03.833 --> 34:05.710
I mean,
you can leave as is

34:05.793 --> 34:07.295
or make any changes
you see fit

34:07.378 --> 34:09.213
based on what I just said.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.841
Hardin wants to get this
to SBI sooner than later.

34:25.062 --> 34:26.564
Have you given
a statement?

34:27.607 --> 34:29.942
Uh, no.
Nothing official.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.152
Just, uh,

34:31.235 --> 34:33.905
you know, I told them
I came in and, um,

34:33.988 --> 34:35.490
I found her there.

34:36.991 --> 34:39.202
You didn't hear
or see anything?

34:39.285 --> 34:41.829
I have to take this.
It's, uh, Todd.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.791
Hey, Todd.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.584
-So...
-I just found her there.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.045
She, she was breathing.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.632
And then she wasn't.

34:53.883 --> 34:57.845
How long between
when she left you

34:57.929 --> 34:59.806
-to when you found her?
-I don't know.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.641
It couldn't be
more than half an hour.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.812
You didn't hear her scream,
call your name or?

35:05.895 --> 35:07.688
I, I didn't hear
a goddamn thing.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.485
Alright.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.118
You know Rae Carruth?

35:23.162 --> 35:24.121
-The football player.
-Yeah, of course, I do.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.792
I represented him
last October.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.126
-Yeah, I know.
-Hmm.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.504
Case had a lot
of moving parts,

35:31.587 --> 35:33.172
multiple charges.

35:36.008 --> 35:38.427
He-he shot
his pregnant girlfriend.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.888
All I'm saying is,
we helped him quite a bit.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.099
Got him a vastly
reduced sentence.

35:45.268 --> 35:48.855
Though God willing,
you won't need any help.

35:48.938 --> 35:53.818
But sometimes good people
get dragged into situations

35:53.901 --> 35:55.194
that turn out bad.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.112
Okay. So...

35:58.698 --> 36:01.576
how much is it going to cost?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.452
A case like this,
you're going to need

36:03.536 --> 36:05.496
jury consultants,
blood analysts.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.999
Between four
and five hundred K.

36:08.082 --> 36:09.542
Half a million bucks.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.252
I've got five kids
to worry about, you know.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.587
Three still in college.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.338
Good defense isn't cheap.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.300
I shouldn't need a defense.
I shouldn't even be here.

36:19.552 --> 36:22.013
Does Kathleen have
life insurance?

36:22.638 --> 36:23.472
-Savings?
-Yes.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.683
So...

36:27.393 --> 36:29.604
When it comes
to staying out of prison,

36:29.687 --> 36:30.104
anything's up for grabs.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.358
Sorry about that.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.236
Martha and Caitlin
are here.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.696
Candace and Lori too.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.907
So we're going
to meet at Larry's.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.950
Okay. Then maybe
I shouldn't keep you.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.162
-Did you two...
-Yeah, yeah, we're, uh...

36:51.167 --> 36:52.585
Well, um...

36:55.046 --> 36:57.506
regardless of whether
or not you, um,

36:57.590 --> 37:00.760
end up hiring me,
one piece of advice:

37:00.843 --> 37:01.844
keep your family close.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.055
You'll need them
on your side.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.641
-Thank you.
-Of course,

37:06.724 --> 37:08.059
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.577
-That was fast.
-Yeah.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.747
What do you think?

37:32.792 --> 37:34.543
I don't know.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.337
My guy over
at the Durham station

37:36.420 --> 37:39.423
says the crime scene photos
are a goddamn nightmare.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.884
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.428
But autopsy
isn't back yet, so...

37:44.512 --> 37:47.056
-We'll see.
-911 call?

37:47.139 --> 37:48.557
Sounds like he's in shock.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.435
It doesn't feel like
an act to me.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.982
Pastrami any good here?

38:00.152 --> 38:00.319
Hmm.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.624
They're all in here.

38:15.626 --> 38:16.919
-- Margaret.
-- I'm sorry.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.129
I'm sorry.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.047
My flight got canceled

38:20.131 --> 38:22.550
'cause of some terror scare.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.384
Are you okay?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.344
Yeah,
yeah, I just wanted

38:25.428 --> 38:26.762
to get to you guys.

38:40.651 --> 38:41.736
Ask him.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.659
Mike, what's goin' on?

38:48.743 --> 38:50.870
Um...

38:50.953 --> 38:52.663
Lori and I are feeling

38:52.747 --> 38:54.665
a little in the dark over here.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.834
About what?

38:59.211 --> 39:01.172
Uh, what happened?

39:02.673 --> 39:04.300
Well, she fell.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.597
Yeah, but it was
our sister's last night.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.098
Can we talk
about this later?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.225
We would really like
to do this now.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.770
-Could you just say more--
-I just sold a book

39:15.853 --> 39:17.146
to a producer
in Hollywood.

39:18.981 --> 39:21.108
With everything going on
at Nortel, it, it...

39:23.194 --> 39:26.530
was, uh, it was good
to have some good news.

39:28.365 --> 39:29.366
Um...

39:31.535 --> 39:35.289
I went, I went to Blockbuster,
got a movie.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.793
"America's Sweethearts."
It was so dumb.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.544
Kathleen was,
was cracking up.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.466
And, uh...

39:47.468 --> 39:48.552
it was a nice day.

39:51.639 --> 39:52.723
And then Todd came by.

39:53.891 --> 39:54.767
Yeah, around- 00.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.603
I was meeting
a friend there at the house,

39:57.686 --> 39:58.521
and we were going
to this Christmas party.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.776
Mom was
pretty tipsy already.

40:07.404 --> 40:10.783
When they left,
Kathleen got a, a call

40:10.866 --> 40:11.700
about a work email.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.995
She was, she was annoyed
that she'd have to,

40:15.079 --> 40:16.622
you know, wake up early.

40:16.705 --> 40:20.960
But it was a Saturday,
and we were having a nice night.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.837
So we went out to the pool,

40:22.920 --> 40:27.508
and, uh... we just smoked
and talked,

40:27.591 --> 40:29.593
you know, about the kids,
about Christmas.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.181
And then she said,
"I have to go up.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.226
I have that call
in the morning."

40:40.396 --> 40:40.563
And that was it.

40:45.568 --> 40:48.529
I went in later,
and I found her laying there.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.739
But what are the police
looking for?

40:50.823 --> 40:52.992
Oh, I have no idea.

40:53.075 --> 40:55.119
You know, the cops
around here, they hated me

40:55.202 --> 40:57.371
ever since I started
writing in the local paper.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.959
You know, I tried to expose
what's going on in this town,

41:02.042 --> 41:04.628
and that they-- and now
they're torturing us.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.589
They've been awful.

41:06.672 --> 41:09.258
I've never seen anything
like it in my 30 years of law.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.394
Um, will you pass
the mashed potatoes, please.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.115
Candace, are you sure
you don't need a place to stay?

41:33.199 --> 41:35.367
No, thank you.

41:35.451 --> 41:38.120
We're good. Uh, I booked us
a room at the, uh...

41:40.164 --> 41:42.917
the inn there
in Chapel Hill, so...

41:43.000 --> 41:44.793
Let us know
if you change your mind.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.086
Thank you, Larry.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.423
Should we, um...

41:51.175 --> 41:54.303
Mike, have you thought
about the wake?

41:54.386 --> 41:57.306
We're, we're all set
at the Howerton Bryan?

41:57.389 --> 41:58.641
-It's a nice place.
-Okay.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.311
Uh, how about music?

42:02.394 --> 42:03.979
We could play
The Mills Brothers.

42:04.063 --> 42:06.440
That's nice.

42:06.523 --> 42:07.441
-What song?
-"You Always"--

42:11.195 --> 42:13.739
Any really. She loved,
she loved them all.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.282
Great idea.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.785
What is going on?

42:42.893 --> 42:46.313
Kathleen would have wanted
you to have some cake.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.065
Even with everything
going on.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.626
Let's just get
the photos and go.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.311
Should we get
out of here?

43:25.394 --> 43:26.603
It's kind of nice in here
with all of her stuff.

43:55.549 --> 43:58.052
What is that?

43:58.135 --> 44:02.139
It's a song I was going
to suggest to play.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.641
I almost blurted it out.

44:07.561 --> 44:11.690
"You Always Hurt
the One You Love."

44:11.774 --> 44:12.775
-Lori...
-What?

44:14.693 --> 44:15.861
It's a good song.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.824
-Kathleen loved it.
-I know.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.579
Why didn't he
tell us himself?

44:28.540 --> 44:30.834
Why call our husbands?

44:30.918 --> 44:34.213
Imagine him having
to say that to us.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.680
I mean, he's a mess.

44:47.017 --> 44:50.854
We're just all going to be
a mess for a while.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.619
It's a great idea, you know.

45:47.703 --> 45:51.123
We've got all this time.
We can do what we want.

45:51.206 --> 45:54.918
I told you that having
an empty nest was fun.

45:55.002 --> 45:55.502
Oh, come on.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.588
We would party like this

45:57.671 --> 45:58.505
with the kids upstairs too.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.467
That must be
where they get it from.

46:03.802 --> 46:06.346
-Oh, you want a sip?
-I do.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.182
I think. Yes.

46:08.265 --> 46:08.765
Thank you.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.728
You're so polite.
Thank you.

46:13.770 --> 46:14.855
Oh, man.

46:15.564 --> 46:16.940
Okay. Come on.

46:17.983 --> 46:21.487
...amazing,
and good culture, too.

46:21.570 --> 46:24.072
You know, we were
at this Italian restaurant

46:24.156 --> 46:26.074
in, uh, in Miami,

46:26.158 --> 46:27.701
and it was in, um...

46:27.784 --> 46:30.370
What was the name
of that neighborhood?

46:30.454 --> 46:31.705
Uh, it was Miami.

46:31.788 --> 46:35.417
Uh, yes, dear, yes.
It, it was Miami.

46:36.210 --> 46:39.004
-She's, uh...
-What? Shut up.

46:39.087 --> 46:40.005
Uh, fuck it,
doesn't matter.

46:40.088 --> 46:44.468
So, uh, so anyway, we,
I was waiting for my Pino,

46:44.551 --> 46:47.554
and, and she was waiting
for the Mexican Coke.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.765
Which is just a Coke
with real sugar

46:49.848 --> 46:50.891
and not that corn syrup.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.559
-Yeah, it's better.
-Uh, okay, so anyhow.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.686
And then,
then the boss comes over.

46:54.770 --> 46:57.189
And he's holding
a bottle of Coke,

46:57.272 --> 47:00.067
and I swear to God
he presents it

47:00.150 --> 47:01.443
like, like it was
a bottle of wine.

47:01.527 --> 47:03.570
And he says,
no, very seriously,

47:03.654 --> 47:06.657
"We did not have
the Coke from Mexico.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.451
This Coke is
from Atlanta."

47:11.578 --> 47:14.414
Hey, who wants
to go swimming?

47:14.498 --> 47:15.832
What are you
talking about?

47:17.668 --> 47:19.962
Don't be ridiculous.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.551
-Kathleen Peterson, everyone!

47:28.595 --> 47:31.265
Mike, something's wrong.

47:41.650 --> 47:43.193
What's going on?

47:44.361 --> 47:46.363
What happened?

47:48.031 --> 47:51.076
Two planes just crashed
into the World Trade Center.

47:53.662 --> 47:56.540
Reporter
This was after the first
airplane made impact.

47:56.623 --> 47:58.917
We'll be hearing
from the president
in a little while...

47:59.001 --> 48:00.419
This is really bad.

48:00.502 --> 48:01.962
Reporter
...the White House
knows about this,

48:02.045 --> 48:03.130
which appears
to be deliberate.

48:03.213 --> 48:05.382
Reporter
Do you know whether
or not officials

48:05.465 --> 48:07.384
there at the White House
have been made aware...

48:10.387 --> 48:12.639
-Everybody's waiting.
-I can't see her like that.

48:15.309 --> 48:17.227
Here.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.896
You can't be...

48:20.397 --> 48:21.607
seen absent.

48:21.690 --> 48:22.899
You know, Rudolf's smart,

48:22.983 --> 48:26.820
but I don't want
to go down that road.

48:26.903 --> 48:28.780
The last thing I want to do now
is bankrupt the family.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.490
No.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.826
I'm just saying
if there's a grand jury...

48:32.909 --> 48:33.660
You know, this would be
a lot easier if you stood up.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.163
I didn't do
anything wrong.

48:36.246 --> 48:39.958
Okay. Well, I will look
for an alternative tomorrow.

48:40.042 --> 48:43.045
You know, if it comes
to it, we'll have somebody

48:43.128 --> 48:44.504
who's ready,
somebody who's not going

48:44.588 --> 48:46.340
to cost NFL player money.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.760
Hey.

48:49.843 --> 48:51.428
There's cops downstairs.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.436
Haven't you
already searched?

48:59.519 --> 49:02.814
Yes, sir. This is just
a follow-up search.

49:02.898 --> 49:05.275
All very standard practice
in this kind of case.

49:19.289 --> 49:20.499
Mr. Peterson.

49:21.291 --> 49:23.377
-Mr. Peterson,
-Do you mind?!

49:23.460 --> 49:24.294
I'm getting dressed
to go see my dead wife

49:24.378 --> 49:26.380
in a coffin!

49:26.463 --> 49:28.048
Calm down.
Take a breath.

50:26.565 --> 50:28.734
Oh, Ronnie.

50:40.328 --> 50:40.829
Mike.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.669
I'm going to grab a drink.

51:29.753 --> 51:32.380
Can you grab the bags?

51:32.464 --> 51:33.131
I shouldn't
hang out here long.

51:37.135 --> 51:39.012
Bill! Come here!

51:39.096 --> 51:41.139
What?
What's going on?

51:41.223 --> 51:42.307
Just Bill.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.394
-What's going on?
-Shut the door.

51:49.981 --> 51:54.027
Jesus Christ.
Look at this mess.

51:54.110 --> 51:56.613
-What are these guys
looking for?
-They took the computer.

51:59.991 --> 52:01.952
They must have printed
this out before they left.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.473
Was there a lot
of this stuff on there?

52:26.268 --> 52:28.436
I saved images
from an article.

52:38.655 --> 52:39.197
Michael.

52:41.449 --> 52:42.534
This is a message.

52:44.452 --> 52:45.704
"We got you."

52:47.664 --> 52:48.164
I'm cooked.

52:51.877 --> 52:52.961
No.

52:54.296 --> 52:55.672
I'm home cooking.

53:00.927 --> 53:02.304
David
The phone!

53:04.598 --> 53:05.765
It's for you!

53:05.849 --> 53:07.893
-No one calls me this late.
-Charlene!

53:07.976 --> 53:09.227
Get the phone!

53:09.311 --> 53:10.186
Ugh!

53:13.565 --> 53:14.733
Hello?

53:15.483 --> 53:16.610
Yes.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.612
Yes, just a moment,
please.

53:19.529 --> 53:20.530
It's for you.

53:22.532 --> 53:23.116
Really?

53:25.035 --> 53:25.243
Thanks.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.040
Fuck.

53:32.542 --> 53:34.294
Shit.

53:39.799 --> 53:43.470
Dave Rudolf.

53:43.553 --> 53:46.306
David, it's Michael Peterson.

53:46.389 --> 53:47.849
I need your help.

53:47.933 --> 53:50.894
Alright, lock and load.

53:50.977 --> 53:52.354
Are we ready, boys?

53:52.437 --> 53:53.647
Fred.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.775
You want to join us
for the grand jury.

54:00.236 --> 54:02.989
Freda, if the grand jury
goes our way,

54:03.073 --> 54:06.076
I don't just want you
on the team.

54:06.159 --> 54:08.036
You'll be my right hand.

54:08.119 --> 54:10.205
We need
a strong, fierce

54:10.288 --> 54:12.832
feminine presence
on this case.

54:12.916 --> 54:13.375
And that's you.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.381
Is that
Kathleen's autopsy?

54:19.464 --> 54:20.548
-Hmm.
-I've seen it.

54:21.341 --> 54:23.760
You show it
to the family?

54:23.843 --> 54:25.845
No, I haven't made
that call yet.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.555
Uh, but this isn't
the autopsy.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.391
This... no, this is
something else.

54:31.726 --> 54:34.020
See that guy over there?
David Rudolf.

54:34.104 --> 54:35.355
High-priced lawyer

54:35.438 --> 54:37.190
from Chapel Hill
by way of New York.

54:40.193 --> 54:41.695
What a fuckin' prick.

54:49.911 --> 54:51.705
Good morning.

54:51.788 --> 54:53.248
I'm Jim Hardin,

54:53.331 --> 54:56.876
District Attorney
for Durham County.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.212
And I'm here to present
the case of the people

54:59.295 --> 55:00.296
against
Michael Iver Peterson.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.466
And when I'm done,

55:03.550 --> 55:06.177
I'm going to ask
all of you to vote

55:06.261 --> 55:08.346
on one count of murder

55:08.430 --> 55:10.306
in the first degree.

55:22.318 --> 55:23.486
Hello.

55:24.529 --> 55:26.781
Hey, Mike. It's David.

55:26.865 --> 55:29.784
I'm sorry, Mike,
they're going to indict.

55:29.868 --> 55:33.663
You'll have to turn yourself
in to the police this evening.

55:35.790 --> 55:36.958
Alright, David.

55:37.042 --> 55:38.251
Um...

55:40.170 --> 55:43.757
Uh... alright, um, Mike--

55:43.840 --> 55:45.050
No.

55:46.634 --> 55:49.554
Ask him if there's a chance
they can get you out on bail.

55:49.637 --> 55:53.141
Tell, um, tell Bill we're
going to do what we can,

55:53.224 --> 55:55.101
but, uh,
it's the holidays.

55:55.185 --> 55:58.271
It could take
a little while.

55:58.354 --> 56:00.398
I've, um,
I've alerted the media.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.902
We need to be one step
ahead of the DA now.

56:03.985 --> 56:08.198
You and your family need
to make a statement

56:09.032 --> 56:10.617
In order of importance,

56:10.700 --> 56:13.161
it's, uh, Kathleen's
actual biological family

56:13.244 --> 56:15.914
that they need
to hear from.

56:17.373 --> 56:19.793
We, um, really need
Caitlin to speak.

56:19.876 --> 56:22.587
Okay, David.

56:22.670 --> 56:25.924
Okay? Alright.
And, Mike, Mike?

56:26.007 --> 56:28.968
Bring some money,
like 50 bucks

56:29.052 --> 56:32.555
for the commissary
and bring a Bible.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.140
-Bible?
-If you've got one.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.809
I'd rather bring
a fucking Quran.

56:35.892 --> 56:36.976
Well, um,

56:37.060 --> 56:39.813
it's optics at this point.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.272
It's, um, it's, it's important.

56:41.356 --> 56:44.526
Okay. Okay,
whatever you say,

56:44.609 --> 56:48.655
-Alright. Alright.
-Okay, I'll see you there.

56:48.738 --> 56:49.405
Alright. See you here.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.829
Well... that's it.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.887
Over here, everybody.

58:48.483 --> 58:50.610
Kathleen was my life.

58:50.693 --> 58:55.156
I've whispered her name
in my heart a thousand times.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.491
She is there,
but I can't stop crying.

58:58.618 --> 59:02.705
I would never have done
anything to hurt her.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.332
I am innocent
of these charges,

59:04.415 --> 59:07.126
and we will prove it
in court.

59:08.211 --> 59:10.004
We do not want you
to say anything

59:10.088 --> 59:11.381
against your family.

59:11.464 --> 59:13.549
That's not our intent.

59:13.633 --> 59:15.426
We just would like

59:15.510 --> 59:17.720
the opportunity
to present to you

59:17.804 --> 59:19.514
what we have learned

59:19.597 --> 59:21.975
so that you,
as Kathleen's family,

59:22.058 --> 59:23.476
aren't out of the loop,
so to speak.

59:25.853 --> 59:28.398
We have some photos
we'd like to share.

59:29.315 --> 59:31.150
Freda
They're pretty shocking.

59:32.068 --> 59:33.695
You can say,
"No, uh-uh,

59:33.778 --> 59:35.989
"we don't need
to see that, Freda.

59:36.072 --> 59:38.658
Thank you very much."

59:38.741 --> 59:41.953
But we just feel y'all deserve
the right to make that choice.

59:46.165 --> 59:48.501
We, we'd like to see 'em.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.345
My mother and Mike had

59:59.429 --> 1:00:03.516
an absolutely
loving relationship,

1:00:03.599 --> 1:00:04.225
and there is,
there's no way that

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:06.602
either of them
would ever wish

1:00:06.686 --> 1:00:08.438
any sort of harm
on the other one.

1:00:08.521 --> 1:00:10.523
My mother would be
absolutely appalled.

1:00:13.901 --> 1:00:14.360
Thank you.
That's all.

1:00:22.118 --> 1:00:25.747
There were 35 cuts
and bruises.

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:29.959
And seven...

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:33.338
of these

1:00:34.464 --> 1:00:36.591
deep lacerations
to the scalp.

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:40.762
How... I don't...

1:00:41.721 --> 1:00:45.850
Our autopsy shows
the cause of death

1:00:45.933 --> 1:00:47.560
was blunt force trauma.

1:00:50.063 --> 1:00:52.231
A homicide.

1:00:54.901 --> 1:00:58.363
And we believe Mr. Peterson

1:00:58.446 --> 1:01:02.408
bludgeoned Kathleen to death
and may have strangled her.

1:01:02.492 --> 1:01:04.577
Why would he do that?
It doesn't make sense.

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:12.627
Our officers found
countless images,

1:01:12.710 --> 1:01:13.669
like these...

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:18.132
on his computer
and in his desk.

1:01:18.216 --> 1:01:19.759
And we believe

1:01:21.469 --> 1:01:27.016
your sister found these
on his computer that night.

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:29.560
And she confronted
your brother-in-law about it,

1:01:29.644 --> 1:01:31.896
and a fight ensued.

1:01:42.156 --> 1:01:43.449
What?

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:44.826
Oh my god...

1:01:48.704 --> 1:01:49.831
It doesn't make sense.

1:01:51.207 --> 1:01:51.749
I knew it.

1:01:53.042 --> 1:01:54.836
I knew it.

1:01:56.212 --> 1:01:57.797
I knew
he was hiding something

1:01:57.880 --> 1:01:59.048
when he didn't have
the nerve to call us himself.

1:01:59.132 --> 1:02:01.050
I knew it.

1:02:05.096 --> 1:02:06.347
Hey...

1:02:08.474 --> 1:02:09.559
We couldn't sleep.

1:02:15.731 --> 1:02:17.400
We've heard
so many wonderful stories

1:02:17.483 --> 1:02:20.278
about our sister
this past week.

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:24.949
I just can't imagine
she would have accepted

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:27.827
this in her home.

1:02:32.498 --> 1:02:33.666
In her marriage.

1:03:11.829 --> 1:03:13.164
Let me do it.

1:03:22.423 --> 1:03:23.341
I'm hopeless without you.

1:03:23.424 --> 1:03:25.927
Mmm.
No, you're still young.

1:03:28.804 --> 1:03:30.806
And you're starting
your life again today.

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:34.810
Hmm?
