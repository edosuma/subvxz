01:12.796 --> 01:14.005
Ramona...

01:16.130 --> 01:18.713
You're a really good dancer!

01:20.755 --> 01:23.296
It's probably the drink talking,

01:24.005 --> 01:27.838
but I've had a crush on you
since, like... forever.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.296
Huh?

01:31.505 --> 01:33.879
Yeah, sure, I'd love to go out with you.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.629
Yeah, sure, I'd love to go out with you!

01:36.630 --> 01:38.671
Yeah, sure, I'd love to go out with you!

01:39.088 --> 01:41.713
Ha ha, you're very funny.

01:45.255 --> 01:46.337
Ramona...

01:46.338 --> 01:47.796
Check it out, dumb ass!

01:48.380 --> 01:51.670
Take a couple of puffs of this,
and you're set.

01:51.671 --> 01:54.130
It'll totally calm your nerves.
You'll feel...

01:56.255 --> 01:57.713
...splendider!

02:01.296 --> 02:03.296
- I don't... I don't know about that.
- Dude!

02:05.713 --> 02:07.296
Have a little faith in your brother.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.294
Wait a minute!

02:10.295 --> 02:14.837
There could be cops in the audience
or even worse, children.

02:14.838 --> 02:17.880
So we totally were not doing drugs!
We were...

02:18.546 --> 02:21.088
you know... eating bananas.

02:28.755 --> 02:31.546
This is some good banana right here.

02:40.296 --> 02:41.545
Alright, dude.

02:41.546 --> 02:43.171
You're ready.

02:44.046 --> 02:48.713
This is the night you hook up with her.

03:00.713 --> 03:05.005
So, there I go, walking over to her,
full of confidence

03:06.921 --> 03:09.088
and a hefty amount of booze.

03:14.630 --> 03:15.713
Hey!

03:17.380 --> 03:18.380
Hey!

03:19.213 --> 03:20.671
Wanna... wanna dance?

03:28.171 --> 03:29.879
With you?

03:29.880 --> 03:32.754
My dance moves
really attracted her attention.

03:32.755 --> 03:33.879
Whatever...

03:33.880 --> 03:35.255
Unfortunately!

03:44.005 --> 03:47.754
Things were going well,
but fate reared its ugly head.

03:47.755 --> 03:51.462
All that getting my groove on,
combined with being nervous and drunk,

03:51.463 --> 03:53.046
had one extra effect...

03:54.130 --> 03:58.380
In that exact moment
I really had to go take a leak!

04:02.171 --> 04:04.879
- Anything wrong?
- No, I don't have to go.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.712
You don't have to go where?

04:06.713 --> 04:08.796
Nowhere, just...

04:11.046 --> 04:13.046
Just sit tight, okay. Just... there.

04:22.088 --> 04:24.380
Holy shit!

04:52.546 --> 04:55.754
Hey! Hey! How is it all going?

04:55.755 --> 04:57.754
I just need to step in
and brush up a bit.

04:57.755 --> 05:01.338
Well... Probably not...

05:02.421 --> 05:03.629
Why?

05:03.630 --> 05:05.629
Well, cause... you know.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.338
Out of my way, I'm gonna be sick!

05:10.630 --> 05:12.380
Holy shit!

05:14.296 --> 05:18.088
Yo! Check this shit out!

05:19.005 --> 05:22.254
No, literally, come check
this literal shit

05:22.255 --> 05:24.837
which Andrei just literally took!

05:24.838 --> 05:25.880
John!

05:27.963 --> 05:29.420
Oh, my God!

05:29.421 --> 05:31.546
Nope, that was not God's work.

05:36.963 --> 05:40.046
And that, my friends,
was a truly shitty first date.

06:11.505 --> 06:15.629
They say a real man knows
how to deal with his problems.

06:15.630 --> 06:18.295
So I turned to Mommy.

06:18.296 --> 06:19.380
Mom?

06:22.505 --> 06:26.713
Was Dad successful with the girls?

06:28.671 --> 06:29.921
Oh, yes!

06:30.963 --> 06:32.712
Too successful for his own good.

06:32.713 --> 06:35.087
Stop honking, you fucker!

06:35.088 --> 06:39.338
I'll come and shove
that fucking horn up your ass! Fuck!

06:40.588 --> 06:43.921
Fucking stop honking that fucking horn!

06:44.880 --> 06:47.295
Fuck you too! Fuck you!

06:47.296 --> 06:50.046
I hope you never fucking get
an erection, you asshole!

07:07.380 --> 07:09.295
Hello there, Mrs. Alfred!

07:09.296 --> 07:11.546
Take it easy on the cigarettes, Alin!

07:12.505 --> 07:15.255
I don't want you being a bad influence
on my Andrei.

07:19.713 --> 07:20.755
So?

07:22.296 --> 07:24.880
Is your mom gonna let you come
to the party tonight?

07:26.130 --> 07:30.295
Actually, she agreed
that I can come by your place

07:30.296 --> 07:33.337
and... study.

07:33.338 --> 07:35.046
Say... Clever!

07:35.921 --> 07:38.087
You're not such a dumb cow after all.

07:38.088 --> 07:41.295
- Do you wanna suck on my titty?
- Yeah. Yeah, just like a little...

07:41.296 --> 07:45.505
Believe me, this wasn't even
the weirdest thing I did in this costume.

08:10.546 --> 08:11.713
So...

08:13.755 --> 08:15.962
You gonna hook up with her?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.130
I'm way past that.

08:19.213 --> 08:23.588
Besides, everybody is looking at me like
I'm the guy who took the dump last time.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.880
Nobody remembers that.

08:27.171 --> 08:29.921
Yeah. Do you remember?
Oh, my God!

08:30.963 --> 08:35.171
You walk up to her, you grab her hand.

08:36.171 --> 08:38.546
You ask her to dance.

08:39.546 --> 08:44.546
You pretend to be interested in whatever
bullshit she spews, and you fuck her!

08:47.421 --> 08:49.295
Have you ever fucked a virgin?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.629
- No!
- No! Have you?

08:51.630 --> 08:53.295
Not yet, but...

08:53.296 --> 08:54.712
What is he doing?

08:54.713 --> 08:57.796
Wow, I looked like
I was jacking off angels.

09:00.963 --> 09:01.963
Hey...

09:03.005 --> 09:05.588
- Hey...
- What you pointing at?

09:07.630 --> 09:10.171
The... sky, it seems.

09:11.588 --> 09:13.087
Your hands okay?

09:13.088 --> 09:15.380
Ah, yeah, yeah, no... they're okay.

09:16.588 --> 09:19.630
They're very fine... fine hands. Just...

09:25.380 --> 09:26.838
Relax.

09:27.921 --> 09:29.505
Oh, shit!

09:34.713 --> 09:36.046
You're cute.

09:46.838 --> 09:48.421
How you doing?

09:49.213 --> 09:51.712
- You're doing great.
- Oh, thanks.

09:51.713 --> 09:55.880
So... Listen, there's something
I want to tell you.

09:57.046 --> 09:58.338
Follow me.

10:03.630 --> 10:05.046
Go!

10:09.005 --> 10:10.588
I know you're in love with me.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.255
Me? No way.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.545
Shh! I think it's cute.

10:16.546 --> 10:19.170
A lot of guys have been crazy for me,

10:19.171 --> 10:21.546
but you've literally been mad for years.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.921
Well, yeah.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.046
I know what you want!

10:32.213 --> 10:33.838
Yeah, I love you.

10:35.255 --> 10:36.255
But I'm... I...

10:37.546 --> 10:40.588
I... Look, I'm...

10:41.463 --> 10:45.920
I'm... not like the other guys.

10:45.921 --> 10:47.795
No, don't blow it, man.

10:47.796 --> 10:51.629
But I'm not that shallow
to just want to have sex with you.

10:51.630 --> 10:55.004
It's not called being shallow,
it's called not being stupid.

10:55.005 --> 10:56.545
I want a relationship.

10:56.546 --> 10:58.420
Say what?

10:58.421 --> 10:59.379
What?

10:59.380 --> 11:04.087
Something that...
that lasts into all of eternity.

11:04.088 --> 11:05.671
- And...
- Shh! What the fuck?

11:06.546 --> 11:07.462
Are you serious?

11:07.463 --> 11:08.920
Ah, yeah... what the fuck?

11:08.921 --> 11:11.588
In what relationship? Look...

11:15.213 --> 11:21.921
I'm the hottest girl at school
and you're... you.

11:24.171 --> 11:25.588
Stop being silly.

11:30.671 --> 11:33.005
Sorry, guy in the fourth row.
No boobies for you.

11:33.796 --> 11:37.670
Rather than have you for one night

11:37.671 --> 11:42.380
and then lose any chance
of having you forever...

11:43.713 --> 11:45.213
I'd rather not have you at all.

11:47.921 --> 11:50.255
I just nutted
when your boobs touched my chest.

11:51.838 --> 11:53.338
God, you're a fucking moron!

11:54.213 --> 11:55.837
Wow, twice!

11:55.838 --> 11:59.088
I'm giving you what any guy would kill
to have and you say "No thanks"?

12:03.171 --> 12:04.463
Fuck you!

12:28.463 --> 12:30.879
I think I just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.004
Isn't that what your mom said
when you were born?

12:33.005 --> 12:34.380
Cut it out, dumb ass!

12:36.671 --> 12:38.004
I meant Ramona.

12:38.005 --> 12:41.588
Ah, yeah.
I'd move out of town if I were you.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.796
Maybe even the city.

12:45.671 --> 12:48.296
The town is the city, you fuckwit.

12:50.755 --> 12:53.588
I just can't have sex with a girl
if we're not in a relationship.

12:57.255 --> 13:00.505
- You wanna do it or should I?
- Oh, you've known him longer.

13:04.838 --> 13:05.963
Alright.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.838
Listen, motherfucker!

13:10.713 --> 13:14.379
I would take a science test every day
for the rest of my life

13:14.380 --> 13:16.213
just to smell that pussy!

13:19.046 --> 13:21.588
Yeah, well, maybe I'm dumber.

13:24.588 --> 13:26.963
Forget about it.
You made the right call.

13:28.588 --> 13:31.296
Ramona means more to you
than just a one-night stand.

13:32.838 --> 13:34.587
I was good.

13:34.588 --> 13:36.920
Ramona was now Silviu's girlfriend,

13:36.921 --> 13:40.505
giving me the perfect excuse
to forget about her.

13:44.713 --> 13:46.254
Day after day

13:46.255 --> 13:50.045
and I couldn't believe Silviu
hadn't been hit by a truck

13:50.046 --> 13:51.630
or struck by lightning or something.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.670
Shut up, dude!
In life it's always better to be honest.

14:00.671 --> 14:03.088
Yes, if you're retarded.

14:04.213 --> 14:07.796
Because retarded people don't understand
the concept of getting away with lies.

14:11.171 --> 14:13.170
Come on, finish my homework.

14:13.171 --> 14:15.421
- Please, I...
- No, no. Finish it now.

14:16.213 --> 14:18.462
- Faster!
- Okay.

14:18.463 --> 14:21.004
Silviu, we need to talk.

14:21.005 --> 14:24.545
Make it fast,
I'm busy with my math homework.

14:24.546 --> 14:26.420
Here's the thing...

14:26.421 --> 14:29.170
I know Ramona only hooked up
with you to get back at me...

14:29.171 --> 14:31.462
- My God...
- I think you can tell that as well.

14:31.463 --> 14:33.004
It's like he's breaking up with him.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.087
...for the sake
of our long-lasting friendship,

14:36.088 --> 14:38.630
I think you'd agree
that you should break up with her.

14:42.171 --> 14:43.545
What did you say?

14:43.546 --> 14:47.337
Yeah, it's only fair for you to not be
caught between me and Ramona

14:47.338 --> 14:49.588
just so that she can make me jealous.

14:52.921 --> 14:54.588
So I'm just a loser

14:55.713 --> 14:58.713
and there's no way
she can actually be into me, right?

14:59.588 --> 15:02.295
No, what I meant to say...

15:02.296 --> 15:04.463
What? That you're better than me?

15:06.296 --> 15:08.671
No, I just don't want you to get hurt.

15:09.296 --> 15:12.005
Hey, babe, check this little shit out.

15:16.838 --> 15:20.005
He says you only got with me
to get back at him.

15:20.588 --> 15:23.046
- What?
- Is that true?

15:24.713 --> 15:26.338
I don't know what he's talking about.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.254
I've had a crush on you
ever since I saw you.

15:29.255 --> 15:32.213
Ramona, let's be honest.

15:33.546 --> 15:36.505
The best thing in life
is to be honest, right?

15:37.463 --> 15:42.255
It's better that you confess to Silviu now
that you got mad at me because...

15:42.755 --> 15:44.879
I didn't want to have sex with you
that night

15:44.880 --> 15:47.629
and that is why you're doing all of this.

15:47.630 --> 15:49.463
You must be out of your mind.

15:50.338 --> 15:53.671
Silviu is the only man
I would ever want to...

15:57.671 --> 15:59.213
make love to.

15:59.838 --> 16:01.130
Bitch!

16:01.713 --> 16:05.545
And by the way...
I didn't want Silviu to know,

16:05.546 --> 16:08.587
but could you please stop texting me
in the middle of the night?

16:08.588 --> 16:10.712
- What?
- I'm really not interested.

16:10.713 --> 16:12.754
You're texting my girl
in the middle of the night?

16:12.755 --> 16:15.962
- No, she's lying!
- So you're calling my girlfriend a liar!

16:15.963 --> 16:19.921
If I didn't say no to her, she wouldn't
even be your fucking girlfriend!

16:20.755 --> 16:22.046
Shit!

16:30.046 --> 16:31.380
Told you so.

16:38.713 --> 16:39.962
If you've got a girl pregnant,

16:39.963 --> 16:44.004
I swear I will break your neck, her legs

16:44.005 --> 16:45.796
and raise the child as my own!

16:51.088 --> 16:53.087
It's not that big a deal.

16:53.088 --> 16:56.921
Why didn't you say so?
Scaring me like that.

16:58.338 --> 16:59.838
Then what's the matter?

17:02.380 --> 17:05.170
You know that girl Ramona that I like?

17:05.171 --> 17:06.587
Well, the thing is...

17:06.588 --> 17:08.462
She's pregnant, I knew it!

17:08.463 --> 17:11.087
I swear I will break your neck!

17:11.088 --> 17:13.588
Mom! No one is pregnant.

17:15.380 --> 17:16.671
It's just that...

17:17.713 --> 17:19.046
I like her.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.255
A lot.

17:22.213 --> 17:23.755
But she's hooked up with Silviu.

17:24.713 --> 17:27.253
And she did it just to make me mad!

17:27.255 --> 17:29.130
- Why would you get mad?
- Well...

17:32.130 --> 17:36.004
...because I refused to have sex
with her.

17:36.005 --> 17:41.046
- What... with Silviu?
- No, Mom! With Ramona!

17:41.921 --> 17:45.296
Well, good then.
That was very wise of you to do that.

17:47.255 --> 17:49.546
You know what sex is, right?

17:51.296 --> 17:53.795
- The fastest way to get a girl pregnant!
- Yeah...

17:53.796 --> 17:56.296
...but now I feel like I let her down.

18:01.338 --> 18:03.505
Honey, you're still young.

18:04.380 --> 18:09.171
You have absolutely no idea what it
takes to actually disappoint a woman.

18:09.921 --> 18:13.380
But believe me,
between now and your fifties,

18:14.213 --> 18:19.088
you're gonna have so many women
to disappoint. It's fantastic.

18:23.213 --> 18:25.296
Thanks for the confidence boost.

18:27.088 --> 18:28.880
You know what you actually need?

18:30.505 --> 18:32.046
A break.

18:40.255 --> 18:42.420
I was embarrassed and tired,

18:42.421 --> 18:45.713
but worst of all I was on vacation
with my mom.

18:46.963 --> 18:52.588
But that all changed the moment
I laid my eyes upon... her!

19:05.838 --> 19:07.588
What the hell's wrong with you?

19:08.130 --> 19:10.254
Never seen a lobby before?

19:10.255 --> 19:11.671
Our room is upstairs!

19:13.005 --> 19:15.088
Yeah, right.

19:16.421 --> 19:20.213
You go. I wanna check out the place.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.283
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, guys, have a safe travel.

19:29.171 --> 19:30.338
Hey!

19:31.255 --> 19:36.129
Listen. Do you know the girl
at the front desk?

19:36.130 --> 19:37.838
I'm... I'm asking for a friend.

19:38.671 --> 19:39.671
Forget about her.

19:40.255 --> 19:41.380
That girl is shady, man.

19:44.130 --> 19:45.630
I heard she is into...

19:48.171 --> 19:49.463
Video chat!

19:50.338 --> 19:51.380
God!

19:53.380 --> 19:55.463
That is... that is preposterous.

19:59.421 --> 20:01.713
- So can you introduce me to her?
- Sure.

20:03.380 --> 20:06.420
Yo, Blondie, this guy likes you!

20:06.421 --> 20:08.296
It's all arranged, sir.

20:10.755 --> 20:12.587
Now that I had my intro,

20:12.588 --> 20:15.796
it was time to use
my gold medal pick-up line on her.

20:16.505 --> 20:18.963
Hey, pretty!

20:20.046 --> 20:24.380
Do you believe in love at first sight?

20:25.421 --> 20:28.088
In case you were wondering
how I was still a virgin...

20:29.380 --> 20:30.837
That's how.

20:30.838 --> 20:37.420
What I meant to say is that you are the
most beautiful woman in the whole hotel,

20:37.421 --> 20:41.546
a title which you share with my mother,
whom I love,

20:42.838 --> 20:44.755
even when she dresses just like me.

20:53.505 --> 20:56.755
Congrats! You've earned the chance
to ask me my name.

20:59.380 --> 21:02.254
So... What is your name?

21:02.255 --> 21:03.963
Anemona. Pleased to meet you.

21:04.796 --> 21:05.838
Andrei.

21:07.171 --> 21:10.463
And I would very much like
to take you out.

21:15.088 --> 21:16.546
Sorry for wasting your time.

21:18.921 --> 21:21.296
You can take me for a walk
on the beach.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.088
So...

21:38.213 --> 21:40.130
What do you do
when you're not working here?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.338
I go to college.

21:45.213 --> 21:47.463
Right, because...

21:48.796 --> 21:52.587
the guy at the bar actually told me

21:52.588 --> 21:55.671
you do video chat?

21:57.630 --> 22:00.338
The guy at the bar
has been hitting on me all summer.

22:01.088 --> 22:02.504
You know what guys are like.

22:02.505 --> 22:05.338
If a girl says no, she's suddenly a slut.

22:06.755 --> 22:07.795
That's not true.

22:07.796 --> 22:10.296
Except for Ramona, that slut!

22:11.921 --> 22:13.130
Anyway...

22:14.213 --> 22:18.421
I think my mom would rather me be doing
video chat than working in a hotel.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.463
Weird.

22:30.130 --> 22:32.880
Listen, you should know that...

22:35.338 --> 22:36.505
I have a boyfriend.

22:38.671 --> 22:40.921
I don't want you to get the wrong idea,
just...

22:43.130 --> 22:45.212
Let's just enjoy the night and that's all.

22:45.213 --> 22:46.213
Yeah.

22:52.630 --> 22:55.380
I'd still like to know more about you.

22:58.296 --> 23:01.380
So... what does your dad do?

23:02.338 --> 23:04.088
Everything but mind us.

23:05.755 --> 23:07.255
Sounds like he could be my dad.

23:10.088 --> 23:11.713
Maybe we're brother and sister.

23:12.213 --> 23:13.338
Like Cersei and Jaime?

23:14.796 --> 23:16.880
Then this would be a really weird date.

23:17.713 --> 23:19.171
So it is a date!

23:21.005 --> 23:25.880
Well, you know...
Dates usually end with a kiss.

23:31.713 --> 23:33.505
Only if you impress the girl.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.921
We're already in the moonlight.

23:41.255 --> 23:43.088
You've got the sea over here.

23:44.713 --> 23:45.963
What else would you want?

23:47.338 --> 23:48.671
A serenade?

23:51.505 --> 23:52.546
Really?

24:11.213 --> 24:16.713
Wise men say

24:18.755 --> 24:24.338
Only fools rush in

24:26.921 --> 24:32.338
Shall I stay

24:33.713 --> 24:38.838
Would it be a sin?

24:40.963 --> 24:46.254
If I can't help

24:46.255 --> 24:52.671
Falling in love with you

24:55.713 --> 24:58.588
Like a river flows

24:59.463 --> 25:01.713
Surely to the sea

25:02.338 --> 25:05.379
Darling, so it goes

25:05.380 --> 25:11.505
Some things are meant to be

25:12.380 --> 25:16.880
Take my hand

25:25.296 --> 25:28.879
That one kiss from her gave me
a pocket rocket so strong

25:28.880 --> 25:32.588
I could've karate chopped
a board in half with it!

25:46.338 --> 25:48.337
I regret nothing.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.213
Who the fuck is Rien?

26:08.838 --> 26:10.380
Warm up the machine.

26:11.255 --> 26:13.796
Failure to properly warm up the engine

26:14.380 --> 26:16.630
and various other
machine components

26:17.338 --> 26:21.712
can result in a decrease in service life
of the machine.

26:21.713 --> 26:23.171
Or in malfunctions.

26:23.796 --> 26:27.962
In winter, run the engine
for at least five minutes

26:27.963 --> 26:29.546
for proper warm up.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.379
Then, run the engine at a low speed

26:33.380 --> 26:36.254
without a load to warm up
the hydraulic oil

26:36.255 --> 26:38.546
and other machine components.

26:39.255 --> 26:40.838
Keep the engine clean!

26:41.671 --> 26:45.004
Dead leaves, paper dust
and oil stains

26:45.005 --> 26:47.837
on and around the engine

26:47.838 --> 26:49.255
can catch fire.

26:49.755 --> 26:54.088
Remove all such debris
before commencing operation.

27:18.963 --> 27:21.462
Wait a minute,
I can't show you this part.

27:21.463 --> 27:23.713
There are children in the audience,
for crying out loud!

27:24.963 --> 27:29.963
But I swear it was as sweet
and delicious as a heavenly dessert.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.629
You know that moment

27:33.630 --> 27:37.255
when you dip
your finger into the honey jar,

27:38.338 --> 27:41.421
and it's so warm and sticky.

27:42.296 --> 27:43.755
You can't get enough.

27:46.588 --> 27:52.130
Or when you're enjoying
a fluffy juicy cake

27:52.796 --> 27:55.796
and it just melts into your mouth.

27:58.171 --> 28:02.171
Then, you feel like going
for the cupcakes.

28:03.171 --> 28:06.213
And you play
with those perfect cherries.

28:06.921 --> 28:12.380
Not too big, not too small...
just right.

28:20.380 --> 28:22.212
Something serious must've happened

28:22.213 --> 28:24.754
if she was calling me
that late at night.

28:24.755 --> 28:26.920
But then I decided to look
on the bright side:

28:26.921 --> 28:28.213
Maybe she was dying.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.755
Now, where were we?

28:35.088 --> 28:37.837
Oh, yeah!
The grand finale,

28:37.838 --> 28:40.005
when you top it off with champagne.

28:40.713 --> 28:42.005
Lots of champagne.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.421
Especially if
the bottle's not been shaken in awhile.

28:50.838 --> 28:51.838
Lower...

28:53.838 --> 28:54.921
Lower...

28:59.921 --> 29:00.963
Do it!

29:02.005 --> 29:03.380
Do what?

29:05.505 --> 29:07.213
Holy... Mom!

29:08.255 --> 29:11.046
- What time is it?
- 10 a.m.

29:11.671 --> 29:15.880
Come on, get dressed,
we're missing out on tan-time.

29:18.796 --> 29:20.505
Just let me freshen up a bit.

29:23.296 --> 29:26.920
I really wanted Anemona to like me
in daytime as well.

29:26.921 --> 29:30.463
So I needed
a little bit of maintenance.

29:32.463 --> 29:33.838
I styled my hair.

29:34.963 --> 29:36.171
Brushed my teeth.

29:39.588 --> 29:41.213
Heck, I even showered!

29:47.880 --> 29:50.879
It was pretty obvious
that I was in a great mood,

29:50.880 --> 29:52.213
but what's up with my mom?

29:52.838 --> 29:54.880
Why is she so upbeat and cheerful?

30:02.630 --> 30:04.671
Hey, dude, guess what?

30:05.213 --> 30:07.545
I just had a date with Anemona
last night.

30:07.546 --> 30:10.713
And I fucked your mother last night.

30:17.088 --> 30:18.088
Mom?

30:21.755 --> 30:22.880
I don't wanna know.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.712
You met someone last night,
didn't you?

30:26.713 --> 30:28.170
Actually, I did.

30:28.171 --> 30:29.463
Someone I like...

30:32.755 --> 30:33.755
I knew it.

30:37.755 --> 30:39.380
But it's okay.

30:40.088 --> 30:43.255
- As long as you're happy.
- No, Mom. Not him.

30:44.005 --> 30:45.546
It's alright, Andrei.

30:46.963 --> 30:48.671
At least you can't get him pregnant.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.088
Anemona!

30:59.630 --> 31:00.921
What's wrong?

31:01.463 --> 31:03.796
- They fired me.
- What?

31:04.838 --> 31:08.046
My supervisor came to me this morning
and said I was fired.

31:12.713 --> 31:14.171
She saw you leaving my room.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.588
It's all my fault.

31:25.546 --> 31:27.088
It could have been anyone.

31:27.838 --> 31:30.463
Okay, there's a reality check!

31:34.005 --> 31:37.629
So what now?
Why are you all packed?

31:37.630 --> 31:39.963
Because it's over for me here.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.338
My boyfriend is coming
to pick me up soon.

31:46.421 --> 31:48.546
He can't see us together, you know?

31:49.838 --> 31:52.255
And the hits just keep on coming.

31:56.505 --> 31:58.421
I just wish we had
a little more time together.

32:00.338 --> 32:03.129
Alright, man up, show some grit!

32:03.130 --> 32:04.713
I don't want you to go.

32:07.671 --> 32:09.296
Please don't go.

32:10.463 --> 32:14.963
Apparently, my flair for the dramatic
outweighs my toughness.

32:15.671 --> 32:17.171
It came out like a flood!

32:17.755 --> 32:20.629
You know what?
Fuck that, it's my story!

32:20.630 --> 32:22.337
It was raining hardcore!

32:22.338 --> 32:25.005
It was raining
like the great flood was coming!

32:29.796 --> 32:31.129
We'll keep in touch.

32:31.130 --> 32:32.963
- I'll come visit.
- No!

32:34.296 --> 32:35.546
You can't, Andrei.

32:36.338 --> 32:38.338
You live at the other end of the country.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.130
This...

32:40.505 --> 32:41.755
Us...

32:43.296 --> 32:44.963
it would never work.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.838
Why fool ourselves?

32:54.213 --> 32:56.296
It's... It's from the rain.

32:59.588 --> 33:01.005
Hey...

33:02.671 --> 33:05.379
If what happened between us
was meant to be,

33:05.380 --> 33:07.296
I'm sure we'll meet again.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.630
I have faith in these kind of things.

33:12.005 --> 33:14.879
Just because a story
doesn't have a happy ending,

33:14.880 --> 33:16.338
doesn't mean that it's over.

33:41.421 --> 33:44.671
I take you to the beach to cheer you up
and you leave here even more depressed?

33:45.338 --> 33:49.295
You're being silly, Andrei! Besides,
I don't even think he's that great a guy!

33:49.296 --> 33:52.046
Mom! She's a girl!

33:53.213 --> 33:54.505
Her name is Anemona

33:55.421 --> 33:58.295
and she is the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

33:58.296 --> 34:00.420
Oh, yeah? That's funny.

34:00.421 --> 34:01.920
I was under the impression

34:01.921 --> 34:04.241
that your mother was
the most beautiful woman in the world.

34:04.755 --> 34:07.130
- What about Ramona?
- What do I care?

34:08.463 --> 34:11.170
All I want right now is to be
with Anemona and no one else.

34:11.170 --> 34:15.213
Well, good for you! That's my boy!

34:16.170 --> 34:20.379
I'm glad I raised me a boy who knows
exactly what he wants in life.

34:20.380 --> 34:21.920
That's good!

34:26.005 --> 34:28.545
Yeah, great...

34:30.545 --> 34:32.795
On second thought, I need you
to drop me off at Ramona's

34:32.795 --> 34:34.920
- as soon as we get there!
- What the fuck?!

34:39.213 --> 34:42.380
Hi there, I'm Andrei,
Ramona's classmate.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.045
Is your daughter home?

34:45.838 --> 34:47.213
Ramona is my sister.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.420
I may be older, but I'm not her mother!

34:51.170 --> 34:53.005
God! Come in.

35:07.713 --> 35:09.713
Are you... alright?

35:10.713 --> 35:12.296
Do I fucking look alright?

35:13.713 --> 35:15.004
Look at me!

35:15.005 --> 35:16.920
And is it alright for me
to call you like crazy

35:16.921 --> 35:19.879
and for you to ignore me like I'm nothing?

35:19.880 --> 35:23.546
So I didn't feel like answering
my phone. Big deal.

35:25.338 --> 35:27.671
What, are we together all of a sudden?

35:29.171 --> 35:31.213
Or maybe you're just jealous.

35:33.838 --> 35:35.046
Jealous of what?

35:38.088 --> 35:39.213
I have a girlfriend now.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.255
Really? What's her full name?

35:44.338 --> 35:46.296
I don't know it.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.463
What's her phone number?

35:50.838 --> 35:52.171
I don't have it.

35:53.380 --> 35:54.962
Is your girlfriend your left hand?

35:54.963 --> 35:56.671
Fuck you! She's real!

35:58.296 --> 35:59.588
I just can't prove it.

36:01.421 --> 36:05.213
You know, that's what they say
about aliens, and God too.

36:07.171 --> 36:08.545
You're just jealous.

36:08.546 --> 36:11.088
Jealous? Me?

36:12.005 --> 36:14.004
Get fucking real, Andrei!

36:14.005 --> 36:17.630
You're crazy about me! You always
come running like a puppy!

36:20.171 --> 36:21.712
I just have to lift my finger.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.171
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

36:25.005 --> 36:28.295
Well, you know what?
Suck it, Ramona!

36:28.296 --> 36:30.088
I don't need you in my life!

36:31.796 --> 36:35.255
There are... There are thousands of girls
out there way hotter than you!

36:36.421 --> 36:38.213
Which I haven't met yet, it's true.

36:38.963 --> 36:42.380
But I'm pretty fucking sure none of them
would treat me the way you do!

36:47.130 --> 36:49.255
I'm just your puppy. Puppy...

36:53.213 --> 36:54.255
Your puppy...

36:59.796 --> 37:02.588
I'm not that sorry Silviu beat you.

37:04.796 --> 37:06.255
I'll go to the police

37:08.380 --> 37:09.755
and tell them you did it.

37:10.296 --> 37:13.963
I'll tell them you left these marks
on my face.

37:16.421 --> 37:18.380
And see how smart
you think you are then.

37:19.796 --> 37:20.796
Idiot.

37:25.005 --> 37:25.962
And fuck off!

37:25.963 --> 37:27.130
What happened?

37:27.838 --> 37:30.046
Andrei, stop being like this!
She needs you.

37:30.963 --> 37:33.130
You know what?
You can suck it too!

37:34.296 --> 37:35.671
Okay. When?

37:39.838 --> 37:42.796
How could I have possibly hit Ramona?
I was at the seaside.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.629
Then who did?

37:45.630 --> 37:47.713
Scooby-Doo!
Who do you think it was?

37:49.005 --> 37:50.045
Silviu.

37:50.046 --> 37:53.420
Or maybe she did it to herself?

37:53.421 --> 37:56.337
Well, if it was Silviu,
why would she say it was you?

37:56.338 --> 37:58.755
Because Ramona
is the offspring of Satan, that's why!

38:02.046 --> 38:03.880
What I meant to say...

38:08.546 --> 38:09.962
Really, Carla? Tampons?

38:09.963 --> 38:11.421
It's all I had to throw.

38:25.713 --> 38:26.921
Cut the bullshit!

38:27.505 --> 38:29.712
You think that just because
you're not saying anything,

38:29.713 --> 38:31.005
I can't see that you're upset?

38:33.630 --> 38:37.171
Ramona told the school
some pretty bad lies about me,

38:38.005 --> 38:40.296
because I've been ignoring her.

38:41.005 --> 38:43.445
Well, that's what any girl would do
if she felt hurt by a guy.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.379
It means that she cares for you.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.630
Really?

38:49.671 --> 38:52.671
Dude, I don't get women at all!

38:54.463 --> 38:57.379
How come every time
I try something with a girl,

38:57.380 --> 38:59.545
I end up looking like a loser?

38:59.546 --> 39:02.463
What do you really want?
You want Ramona?

39:04.005 --> 39:07.921
I thought you were in love with that girl
from the beach, what's her name?

39:10.755 --> 39:11.838
Anemona?

39:14.296 --> 39:17.505
I don't have her number,
I don't have her Facebook.

39:18.588 --> 39:19.920
She's not to be found.

39:19.921 --> 39:23.295
Just because someone's not on
Facebook doesn't mean they don't exist.

39:23.296 --> 39:24.962
But they have Instagram.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.255
You can't give up just because
you're afraid of failure.

39:33.421 --> 39:36.795
Hey, don't judge me!
I was 17 and single!

39:36.796 --> 39:40.171
What did you want me to use
the Internet for? Learning history?

39:44.838 --> 39:47.712
She forgot her wallet in my taxi
a few days back

39:47.713 --> 39:49.463
so I'm trying to give it to her in person.

39:52.463 --> 39:53.463
Hello?

39:54.755 --> 39:55.755
Hi, Anemona!

39:56.755 --> 39:57.755
It's Andrei.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.755
I sang to you on the beach.

40:02.130 --> 40:04.255
You'll have to be more specific
than that.

40:04.921 --> 40:07.504
I've had lots of boys singing to me
on the beach.

40:07.505 --> 40:10.296
I'm kidding, Andrei! How are things?
What's up?

40:11.463 --> 40:14.338
It's all good, I'm good.

40:15.255 --> 40:18.212
Listen, I'll be at the seaside
for a couple of days...

40:18.213 --> 40:23.462
and I was thinking that maybe
we can grab a coffee sometime?

40:23.463 --> 40:27.170
Sure, that sounds nice.
Where are you gonna stay?

40:27.171 --> 40:28.712
I'll find a decent hotel.

40:28.713 --> 40:31.046
Nonsense! You can crash with me.

40:32.338 --> 40:34.420
Play hard to get.

40:34.421 --> 40:35.421
Sure.

40:35.838 --> 40:38.213
Sure, I... If you insist.

41:33.588 --> 41:35.130
Let me show you something.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.880
Hey?

41:57.463 --> 41:58.921
Are you constipated?

42:02.588 --> 42:04.380
This is so good.

42:06.171 --> 42:07.171
I'm coming!

42:08.088 --> 42:10.921
- I'm coming!
- Just hurry the hell up and get out!

42:34.880 --> 42:35.921
Open the door!

42:41.088 --> 42:43.712
Open the door or I will break it in!

42:43.713 --> 42:45.545
- No, I'm gonna go.
- No, I'm going.

42:45.546 --> 42:47.462
- You're in the girls' bathroom.
- So what?

42:47.463 --> 42:49.838
- Let me go!
- I'll go. You stay here, okay?

42:50.546 --> 42:52.170
- You trust me?
- Yes.

42:52.171 --> 42:53.630
Okay, I'll go then.

42:55.338 --> 42:56.380
Okay.

43:02.796 --> 43:06.630
- Out! I wanna talk to this guy.
- I'm not leaving without him.

43:09.046 --> 43:10.338
Out now!

43:10.963 --> 43:13.755
It's okay. I'll be fine.

43:14.338 --> 43:16.837
I'm only just about to be murdered,
that's all.

43:16.838 --> 43:20.588
Okay, little man,
I'm gonna ask you one question.

43:21.921 --> 43:24.713
And you better god damn well think hard
about the answer!

43:26.380 --> 43:28.505
Were you fucking in here?

43:32.130 --> 43:36.046
Regretfully, yes, kind sir.

43:36.838 --> 43:40.088
And I honestly didn't even enjoy it
all that much.

43:40.880 --> 43:44.338
Man to man, I congratulate you!

43:46.046 --> 43:48.255
As a bouncer...
wrong motherfucking answer!

43:49.088 --> 43:52.755
It was at this moment that he knew.
He fucked up!

43:57.546 --> 44:01.630
- Ow!
- Oh, God, this is totally my fault.

44:03.546 --> 44:05.796
Don't worry about it. It was worth it.

44:08.380 --> 44:12.462
I think I might have an idea

44:12.463 --> 44:15.296
that will make you feel even better.

44:23.338 --> 44:25.880
And that's when I understood
the meaning of life.

44:26.380 --> 44:28.046
You...

44:30.630 --> 44:32.546
Blowjobs.

44:33.921 --> 44:39.004
That night I helped her
with an IT problem.

44:39.005 --> 44:45.213
She had a beautiful pink laptop
with a very nice USB port.

44:46.755 --> 44:50.588
My USB stick was... average and...

44:52.005 --> 44:55.546
Wait a minute, it's my damn story!

44:56.546 --> 44:58.838
That USB stick was huge!

45:03.171 --> 45:08.045
I was ready to fit that huge USB
into her rear-mounted VGA,

45:08.046 --> 45:12.380
but yeah, she said she wasn't ready
for that quite yet.

45:15.421 --> 45:16.505
So...

45:19.088 --> 45:21.213
Did you think about
what you're gonna tell him?

45:22.755 --> 45:25.005
I mean... your boyfriend.

45:26.671 --> 45:27.796
About us.

45:33.463 --> 45:35.046
There is no "us," Andrei.

45:36.963 --> 45:38.171
Say what?

45:41.005 --> 45:46.880
I'm with Tudor and I really don't wanna
have this conversation right now.

46:03.213 --> 46:05.880
Can we just rewind there a little bit?

46:07.963 --> 46:10.838
I fell in love with you
from the first moment I saw you!

46:13.255 --> 46:15.005
You're a really good person, Andrei.

46:15.755 --> 46:17.754
I never thought I'd meet
someone like you.

46:17.755 --> 46:20.838
- But apparently not good enough.
- It's not that! It's just...

46:22.171 --> 46:27.588
I'm fucked up, okay?
You're better off, believe me.

46:30.546 --> 46:34.046
- Can't I be the one to decide that?
- There is nothing to decide!

46:44.630 --> 46:47.796
Tudor and I have been together
for a really long time.

46:50.588 --> 46:55.588
He is older, he is rich, he has plans.

46:58.046 --> 46:59.463
- He's been good to me.
- Okay!

47:01.088 --> 47:02.380
You can stop right there.

47:07.130 --> 47:08.963
I can't walk away from him.

47:17.255 --> 47:19.130
But you can walk away from me.

47:21.171 --> 47:22.796
You can walk away from me.

47:26.046 --> 47:27.088
This is...

47:28.796 --> 47:29.796
I...

47:32.505 --> 47:33.546
Fuck it.

47:38.213 --> 47:40.630
It's how it is. Life sucks.

47:44.463 --> 47:46.046
Maybe you shouldn't have come here.

47:50.046 --> 47:52.338
Don't say that. Don't.

47:58.130 --> 47:59.296
This was all wrong.

48:06.588 --> 48:07.755
But I love you.

48:08.421 --> 48:09.671
You have to go.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.504
The only thing that she didn't realize

48:46.505 --> 48:51.505
was that I didn't fall in love with her
because I thought she was perfect.

48:52.421 --> 48:56.337
I fell in love with her
because I knew she wasn't.

48:56.338 --> 48:59.920
When you're young
and get kicked in the balls,

48:59.921 --> 49:01.087
everybody tells you,

49:01.088 --> 49:04.088
"Ah, you'll be fine!
You'll find a non-ball-kicker soon."

49:05.046 --> 49:07.337
They all tell you how it will pass,

49:07.338 --> 49:11.171
how it doesn't really matter
what happens right now.

49:21.088 --> 49:23.171
Fuck it, I always choose the wrong girls!

49:23.963 --> 49:26.504
One of them is fucking my best friend,

49:26.505 --> 49:29.130
and the other one
has a fucking boyfriend!

49:34.088 --> 49:35.880
What the fuck are you looking at?

49:39.463 --> 49:41.963
It's nothing. It's just...

49:43.255 --> 49:47.087
We wanted to tell you that we found out
the truth about you

49:47.088 --> 49:49.921
and we totally think you're very brave.

49:50.963 --> 49:52.629
What the fuck are you talking about?

49:52.630 --> 49:56.962
Ramona told us that Andrei didn't want
to have sex with her that night

49:56.963 --> 50:00.462
because he confessed
that he likes men.

50:00.463 --> 50:04.045
- What?
- Hey, it's okay.

50:04.046 --> 50:07.963
If that's what you all think,
then you can all suck my dick!

50:09.880 --> 50:12.587
Maybe not the wisest choice of words
in this context.

50:12.588 --> 50:14.087
Yeah? Fuck you too!

50:14.088 --> 50:16.670
Again... So gay!

50:16.671 --> 50:19.795
If I'm gay, then you can all kiss my ass!

50:19.796 --> 50:20.963
Andrei, relax!

50:21.963 --> 50:25.546
Everything makes sense now,
and we're all okay with this.

50:26.296 --> 50:27.296
Even the teachers.

50:30.005 --> 50:31.338
The teachers know?

50:38.213 --> 50:42.921
If you ever decide to break up
with this loser, give me a call.

50:44.338 --> 50:45.380
Fuck off.

50:46.505 --> 50:48.046
You stupid jackass!

50:50.213 --> 50:53.338
And you...
Stop sucking on this fucking ice cream.

50:59.380 --> 51:00.463
Remember this...

51:01.296 --> 51:04.421
If a woman gives herself to you,

51:05.421 --> 51:08.421
she tells you that she wants to fuck you

51:09.088 --> 51:12.087
and... you don't fuck her

51:12.088 --> 51:14.046
'cause you're...

51:14.588 --> 51:17.630
you're retarded or something...

51:19.171 --> 51:20.338
she will make you suffer.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.504
Sure. Just let me press
the "go back in time" button

51:23.505 --> 51:24.963
and I'll totally fuck Ramona.

51:25.588 --> 51:27.712
What the fuck
do you want me to do now?

51:27.713 --> 51:30.963
Well, for starters...
Deal with that shit.

51:31.963 --> 51:36.005
Make everybody stop thinking that
you're an insecure gay nerd and a loser.

51:36.505 --> 51:38.505
Hey, I am not a loser!

51:44.963 --> 51:47.254
So now everybody thinks that I'm gay,

51:47.255 --> 51:49.213
the girl I used to like
wants to make me suffer,

51:50.005 --> 51:51.920
the girl I love has a boyfriend...

51:51.921 --> 51:54.712
It's like somebody is strangling my soul

51:54.713 --> 51:58.379
while making me listen
to Britney Spears.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.962
Yes, horrible.

52:00.963 --> 52:05.963
Does life condemn us to be alone
forever if we don't want to be hurt?

52:06.713 --> 52:12.587
Or should we love even though we may cry
and suffer and be unhappy?

52:12.588 --> 52:15.755
Man, you want ketchup or mayonnaise?

52:17.796 --> 52:18.796
Jesus...

52:21.755 --> 52:24.630
How could she say I am gay?

52:26.588 --> 52:30.921
Apparently, the only person
who would still listen to me was Carla.

52:32.463 --> 52:33.588
I like women.

52:34.255 --> 52:38.380
I live to eat pussy.

52:42.755 --> 52:44.880
So you wanna...

52:48.671 --> 52:50.005
No, I...

52:52.255 --> 52:57.380
I just want to forget
about women and love.

53:05.171 --> 53:06.796
Well, this is interesting,

53:11.880 --> 53:14.421
I have 11 fingers.

53:18.755 --> 53:20.130
I'm not kidding.

53:21.296 --> 53:26.129
Look, it's...
one, two, three, four, five...

53:26.130 --> 53:30.046
ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

53:33.005 --> 53:36.296
Five plus six equals 11.

53:36.921 --> 53:38.880
My math teacher
must've been very proud.

53:51.130 --> 53:52.171
Too much banana.

53:52.963 --> 53:55.005
Stop tripping.

53:58.005 --> 53:59.046
I know.

54:00.130 --> 54:04.171
Maybe if you take off your shirt,
you'll feel better.

54:16.755 --> 54:18.505
Yeah, you're right.

54:20.421 --> 54:23.755
- I do feel better.
- Good boy.

54:24.755 --> 54:27.505
Now let's get rid of those trousers too.

54:29.463 --> 54:31.380
What's wrong with my trousers?

54:32.171 --> 54:35.879
I don't know,
you wanted to take off your trousers.

54:35.880 --> 54:39.671
- Man, you're really high.
- No, I'm not.

54:41.213 --> 54:43.255
You think I don't know my own idea?

54:46.296 --> 54:50.254
Maybe if you lie down,
you'll feel even better.

54:50.255 --> 54:52.838
I don't honestly think it's such a good...

55:12.588 --> 55:16.837
And in that moment I finally
understood how Leo DiCaprio felt

55:16.838 --> 55:19.338
when he fucked... fought...

55:20.255 --> 55:21.630
...fought the bear!

55:28.796 --> 55:30.630
That was awesome!

55:32.755 --> 55:34.505
I'm gonna go take a shit now.

55:39.921 --> 55:43.546
Don't worry, lover! I'll be back!

55:54.880 --> 55:56.088
Lover!

55:58.671 --> 55:59.921
I'm coming!

56:02.588 --> 56:06.171
You know, maybe running away
from your problems is wrong.

56:11.630 --> 56:16.295
But when your problem's
a 400-pound sex-crazed hyena

56:16.296 --> 56:17.505
who only wants more...

56:18.171 --> 56:20.380
Yeah, you might wanna
keep on running!

56:28.630 --> 56:31.546
Good morning, sir!
I'm Captain Donger.

56:36.588 --> 56:38.880
Baby, are you sleeping?

56:43.713 --> 56:46.130
Come on, sweetie, wake up, please.

56:50.838 --> 56:52.045
Get up, you lazy fart!

56:52.046 --> 56:54.088
It's 12 o'clock, wake up already!

56:55.338 --> 56:56.546
That's my boy.

56:57.046 --> 56:58.380
Alin's come to visit.

56:59.088 --> 57:02.630
And he came with the Russians?
Why the hell are you yelling?

57:09.796 --> 57:10.796
Andrei...

57:11.796 --> 57:15.255
I'm very sorry, but...
I have to break up with you.

57:16.796 --> 57:20.255
- Are you high?
- Yeah, a bit, yeah...

57:21.338 --> 57:22.618
...but that's besides the point.

57:25.130 --> 57:26.920
What the hell are you talking about?

57:26.921 --> 57:28.963
Dude, we got to do something.

57:30.380 --> 57:34.588
Last night, I was out

57:36.005 --> 57:39.630
talking to some chick and...

57:40.921 --> 57:47.463
every girl in this city thinks that I'm...

57:52.505 --> 57:54.505
Well, at least you didn't bone
Jabba the Hutt!

57:55.255 --> 57:58.296
You know what's ten times
fucking worse?

57:59.588 --> 58:01.255
They think I'm your boyfriend.

58:02.713 --> 58:03.880
I feel you, bro.

58:05.963 --> 58:09.255
And you're right.
I hate Ramona for the whole thing,

58:10.213 --> 58:13.213
but last night I made up my mind.

58:13.921 --> 58:16.629
I am going to show her and Silviu

58:16.630 --> 58:19.087
that I am not the loser they think I am!

58:19.088 --> 58:20.212
Okay, you're overreacting.

58:20.213 --> 58:22.337
So many years,

58:22.338 --> 58:25.463
but today is the day I say "No more!"

58:26.046 --> 58:30.045
- Dude...
- I refuse to be Ramona's lapdog!

58:30.046 --> 58:33.295
- Hey, asshole!
- And the most important thing of all...

58:33.296 --> 58:37.088
I refuse to have sex
with another fat girl!

58:37.671 --> 58:38.962
Wait, what?

58:38.963 --> 58:41.545
Andrei!

58:41.546 --> 58:45.004
Andrei!

58:45.005 --> 58:49.130
Dude! Chill the fuck out, you shitheel!

58:51.421 --> 58:54.296
- I overreacted a bit.
- You think?

59:00.255 --> 59:04.338
But seriously, though,
I will have my revenge!

59:05.380 --> 59:09.213
If I wanted to impress Ramona,
I needed a "look."

59:13.005 --> 59:14.380
I began hittin' the gym.

59:15.255 --> 59:17.254
Not for working out or anything,

59:17.255 --> 59:18.921
exercise is way overrated!

59:19.796 --> 59:22.796
I needed some badass pics
so that Ramona could see them.

59:24.213 --> 59:27.421
Everyone found out
that Alin and I weren't gay.

59:27.963 --> 59:32.046
Alin should've been tickled pink that
people thought I was his boyfriend.

59:33.088 --> 59:35.046
I was finally ready.

59:35.713 --> 59:38.962
Execute Operation Ramona!

59:38.963 --> 59:41.838
Hey, look who just saw my instastory.

01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:33.380
Ramona didn't just see me,
that "biatch" felt me!

01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:54.630
Hey, Andrei, how have you been?

01:01:01.088 --> 01:01:02.963
Don't say a word.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:17.380
Just let me look at you for a second.

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.921
You're still the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

01:01:36.963 --> 01:01:38.171
God, I missed you.

01:01:40.005 --> 01:01:42.088
At that moment, I was sure

01:01:42.838 --> 01:01:45.463
even her soul wanted to fuck me.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.671
You look different.

01:01:51.963 --> 01:01:53.005
I like it.

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.504
Of course you do.

01:01:55.505 --> 01:01:57.296
A little bit arrogant, don't you think?

01:01:58.546 --> 01:02:00.421
It's only arrogance if it's not true.

01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:04.296
And we both know it is true.

01:02:11.296 --> 01:02:12.421
Listen.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.213
I got to bounce,

01:02:17.546 --> 01:02:19.588
but maybe come over to my house
one night,

01:02:20.463 --> 01:02:21.921
watch a movie...

01:02:22.546 --> 01:02:25.963
You know, Netflix and chill.

01:02:26.796 --> 01:02:30.171
Yeah, smooth
as a bull in a china shop.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:35.005
I don't know,
we're not that close anymore.

01:02:36.338 --> 01:02:37.796
And whose fault is it?

01:02:55.088 --> 01:02:57.755
50 Shades of Andrei!

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:02.421
See you later, little goose.

01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:08.463
Now that I'd planted the seed
in her head, all I had to do was wait.

01:03:08.963 --> 01:03:14.171
If everything went as planned, maybe
I could also plant my seed in her.

01:03:18.046 --> 01:03:21.379
Ramona started acting differently
towards me all of a sudden.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.420
You know...

01:03:22.421 --> 01:03:24.837
Hey! What's up?

01:03:24.838 --> 01:03:26.630
...like I was an actual human being!

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.380
Apparently, we were now on kissing
terms whenever we saw each other.

01:03:42.505 --> 01:03:45.005
The plan was working like a charm.

01:03:45.671 --> 01:03:49.045
But there was something else
I had to do first.

01:03:49.046 --> 01:03:50.130
You fucking pussy!

01:03:51.755 --> 01:03:52.838
Jesus Christ!

01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:56.129
What's wrong with you? Hey!

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:57.295
- What?
- What?

01:03:57.296 --> 01:03:58.630
- What?
- Hey!

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:02.713
Carla!

01:04:06.796 --> 01:04:08.630
I need to tell you something.

01:04:12.838 --> 01:04:14.338
Please don't eat me!

01:04:17.171 --> 01:04:21.338
Look, I know we haven't talked
all that much since...

01:04:23.046 --> 01:04:24.337
You know...

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:28.379
Since you ran like a little girl
leaving me unsatisfied?

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.880
Yeah, I think I remember.

01:04:32.255 --> 01:04:33.337
Well, that's the thing!

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:39.296
You are the most wonderful girl
I've ever seen.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.420
- Andrei, I can't believe this!
- No, no, no, just...

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.421
Don't get me wrong!

01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:49.713
I enjoyed our night together,
but that's it.

01:04:50.588 --> 01:04:53.545
I like you more like just a friend.

01:04:53.546 --> 01:04:55.837
What? Come again?

01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:57.963
Did I just get friend zoned
by Jabba the Hutt?

01:05:02.296 --> 01:05:05.046
You know, it won't be easy...

01:05:06.671 --> 01:05:13.796
but I will try to get over
this disappointment somehow.

01:05:18.255 --> 01:05:19.838
But know this...

01:05:20.755 --> 01:05:26.588
I will never ever forget about you.

01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:31.587
Kind of like the same way the Titanic
will never ever forget

01:05:31.588 --> 01:05:33.130
hitting that iceberg.

01:05:33.713 --> 01:05:37.255
You are so sweet, Andrei!

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:46.921
Pussy!

01:05:50.796 --> 01:05:51.796
Bye!

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:00.505
Guys, I know what I'm doing, okay?

01:06:17.755 --> 01:06:20.170
Hey, Silviu,
did you do your math homework?

01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:21.754
Let me check.

01:06:21.755 --> 01:06:25.546
Yo, peasant!
Did we do my math homework?

01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:27.546
Of course, boss.

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:32.171
Four pages.

01:06:34.671 --> 01:06:36.088
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:06:52.046 --> 01:06:53.088
Silviu!

01:07:00.463 --> 01:07:01.463
Yes!

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:04.255
Yes what?

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:10.005
Yes, I would love to be your girlfriend!

01:07:12.713 --> 01:07:14.837
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:07:14.838 --> 01:07:18.129
I got your flowers
and I read your note too.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:20.505
You know,
from the ninth grade I hoped...

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:23.880
No, I knew that we would be together
one day.

01:07:28.963 --> 01:07:30.462
Are you high?

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:35.421
How the fuck do you think
you could ever be my girlfriend?

01:07:36.171 --> 01:07:39.130
Don't you realize that you are
as fat as a hippo?

01:07:40.463 --> 01:07:43.796
Get lost, bitch!
You're making me look bad.

01:07:44.921 --> 01:07:46.255
Really?

01:07:47.046 --> 01:07:50.837
But last year I was good enough
for you to lose your virginity to, right?

01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:51.754
What?

01:07:51.755 --> 01:07:53.754
I thought we agreed
not to talk about that.

01:07:53.755 --> 01:07:55.295
Motherfucker!

01:07:55.296 --> 01:08:00.962
I let you defile my sweet cherry,
and this is how you repay me?

01:08:00.963 --> 01:08:02.546
Fight!

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:08.880
Fight!

01:08:16.255 --> 01:08:18.712
Shot! Headshot!

01:08:33.962 --> 01:08:36.505
Look at him crying like a little baby!

01:08:37.296 --> 01:08:38.545
The same way he did

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:42.005
after we had sex
and you asked me to cuddle you!

01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:47.921
So, we meet tonight as planned?

01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.046
Wear something comfortable.

01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:11.045
Wow!

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.796
Oh, cut it out!

01:09:13.296 --> 01:09:16.212
- I'm blushing.
- No, really, I'm amazed.

01:09:17.337 --> 01:09:19.337
This is what you understand
by "comfortable"?

01:09:20.087 --> 01:09:22.796
What? My outfit isn't appropriate?

01:09:23.212 --> 01:09:25.796
Yes, it is. For a party...

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:37.296
The fuck?

01:09:37.837 --> 01:09:39.421
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:41.546 --> 01:09:44.837
Nothing will happen to you!
Totally got your back!

01:09:49.296 --> 01:09:52.962
All we have to do is climb a few stairs
and we'll arrive at our destination.

01:09:59.046 --> 01:10:00.755
"Climb a few stairs..."

01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:03.504
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:10:03.505 --> 01:10:06.880
What is this,
a date or the fucking Olympics?

01:10:14.713 --> 01:10:16.630
See? It's not that bad.

01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.713
I can barely see where I'm stepping.

01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:23.755
And you're staring at my ass.

01:10:27.255 --> 01:10:28.255
Fuck!

01:10:53.505 --> 01:10:55.671
I wanted to bring you
somewhere very special for me.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.130
Here is where I come and read
from time to time.

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:02.587
I did want to have dinner
with you tonight,

01:11:02.588 --> 01:11:07.087
but I figured a restaurant wouldn't be
good enough for me to tell you

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:11.088
that you are the most beautiful girl
in the world

01:11:12.796 --> 01:11:16.838
and being here, you can see yourself
the way I see you...

01:11:23.421 --> 01:11:25.088
above everybody else.

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:41.255
Here's to... second chances.

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:44.130
Cheers!

01:11:50.755 --> 01:11:52.921
Everything is starting
to make sense now.

01:11:55.796 --> 01:11:59.587
I'm beginning to understand
what really matters in life and...

01:11:59.588 --> 01:12:00.671
Me too!

01:12:02.546 --> 01:12:05.880
Like beer, FIFA, chocolate.

01:12:08.755 --> 01:12:14.630
I meant like...
protection, support, loyalty.

01:12:19.755 --> 01:12:21.338
I feel amazing right now.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.088
I feel amazing with you.

01:12:34.796 --> 01:12:37.046
I feel amazing with you too.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:43.505
And I also got to stare at your ass.

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:02.130
You know,

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:05.129
it's getting chilly outside and...

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:09.005
your place is very close to here.

01:13:10.588 --> 01:13:12.963
You wouldn't want to catch a cold,
right?

01:13:15.046 --> 01:13:16.255
Of course.

01:13:17.963 --> 01:13:21.338
Maybe watch a movie, right?

01:13:24.338 --> 01:13:26.255
You're all the same after all,
aren't you?

01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:30.796
I'm not like the other guys
and you know it.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.588
Yeah, right.

01:13:40.588 --> 01:13:44.838
Guy in the fourth row,
now's the time, buddy. Enjoy!

01:15:27.296 --> 01:15:28.921
Nice fur!

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:39.462
I told you I'm not like the other guys.

01:15:39.463 --> 01:15:42.213
Nothing will happen tonight.
Goodnight!

01:15:48.671 --> 01:15:50.088
Don't try this at home.

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:17.963
Morning!

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.088
I realized that nobody cares for me
the way you do...

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:37.213
and I'm sorry for all the bad things
I've done to you.

01:16:39.088 --> 01:16:42.213
And that was the exact moment
when Hell began to freeze over.

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.130
All I want is another chance.

01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:55.755
Give us this chance.

01:16:56.963 --> 01:16:59.962
I know it's weird,
but I was kind of enjoying the moment.

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:03.587
After all, I was in love with the girl
for practically forever,

01:17:03.588 --> 01:17:06.462
and now she was asking
me to be with her.

01:17:06.463 --> 01:17:09.171
Wow, impossible is nothing, I guess!

01:17:30.338 --> 01:17:32.587
I really want this to work between us.

01:17:32.588 --> 01:17:35.921
Me too!
Me too, and I know it will all work out.

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.546
What's wrong?

01:17:58.463 --> 01:17:59.713
I have to go.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:03.088
What, now? Where?

01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:06.337
Please, brain,
give me a good excuse!

01:18:06.338 --> 01:18:07.421
Well...

01:18:08.671 --> 01:18:10.130
The thing is...

01:18:11.463 --> 01:18:14.754
I... have another girlfriend.

01:18:14.755 --> 01:18:15.920
Wow...

01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:17.546
- What?
- Fuck you, brain!

01:18:18.421 --> 01:18:19.541
You have another girlfriend?

01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:27.545
Yes. She's at the bus station
and I have to pick her up.

01:18:27.546 --> 01:18:30.630
Sometimes it's just better
to tell the truth...

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:36.005
That's a good one!

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:40.796
...because nobody will ever believe
that it can be that stupid.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.546
Holy shit!

01:18:45.963 --> 01:18:49.171
Sure! I understand.

01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:54.380
Gotta go pick up your "girlfriend."

01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:58.004
- You sure about that?
- Sure, baby.

01:18:58.005 --> 01:18:59.588
You got to do what you got to do.

01:19:00.296 --> 01:19:02.171
Go pick her up...

01:19:03.255 --> 01:19:05.421
okay. I will.

01:19:11.005 --> 01:19:12.588
You can be honest with me.

01:19:17.171 --> 01:19:19.796
Even princesses need to shit,
you know.

01:19:22.463 --> 01:19:24.879
You got me, you really got me!

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.920
But I really need to go. Like now.

01:19:27.921 --> 01:19:29.130
Yeah, go!

01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:40.921
What is wrong with all the people
in your town?

01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:43.213
Why are they all dancing?

01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:46.713
We get high a lot.

01:20:47.588 --> 01:20:49.545
He's so sweet, I like a lot...

01:20:49.546 --> 01:20:53.213
Mom always knew how to make me
look like a stud in front of the girls.

01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:57.754
I know. Do you know,
when he was about that age,

01:20:57.755 --> 01:20:59.004
he was about one years old,

01:20:59.005 --> 01:21:02.004
he... every time we put him in the bath,
he pooped.

01:21:02.005 --> 01:21:03.920
- What? No!
- Yeah!

01:21:03.921 --> 01:21:06.379
Yeah, just put him in the bath
and out came a poo.

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.920
I don't know what it was.

01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:11.504
It was something about the warm water,
just kinda got his bowels going,

01:21:11.505 --> 01:21:13.795
- so he just took a shit.
- That's horrible.

01:21:13.796 --> 01:21:15.545
A little turd in the pool.

01:21:15.546 --> 01:21:18.755
Every day for about six months,
he pooed in the bath.

01:21:19.296 --> 01:21:21.045
Oh, my god! That's so gross!

01:21:21.046 --> 01:21:23.212
It was just when he was starting
to walk as well,

01:21:23.213 --> 01:21:26.213
so he'd just stand up in the bath
and just like "bluuup."

01:21:29.213 --> 01:21:31.545
- I know.
- Oh, God. Poor mother...

01:21:31.546 --> 01:21:32.837
I know!

01:21:32.838 --> 01:21:37.295
- What did you do with that?
- Well, at the beginning... winky, winky.

01:21:37.296 --> 01:21:39.421
Your poor guests.

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.421
Hey! What happened?

01:21:43.088 --> 01:21:44.754
Fuck you, that's what happened!

01:21:44.755 --> 01:21:48.004
You leave me in the middle of the road
and then you don't say anything?

01:21:48.005 --> 01:21:49.379
Really?

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.837
I'm sorry,

01:21:50.838 --> 01:21:52.462
but I was kind of busy.

01:21:52.463 --> 01:21:55.879
For six hours?
I thought you'd died on that toilet seat.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.420
I'll make up for this, I promise.

01:21:58.421 --> 01:22:03.755
Tonight, when you go out with me,
you'll bring me lilies.

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.170
Oh, tonight...
I don't think I can make it tonight.

01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:12.505
- I... I have a thing.
- Okay, tomorrow night then.

01:22:13.088 --> 01:22:14.255
Tomorrow night...

01:22:15.213 --> 01:22:18.213
It doesn't really work for me,
I have to see a guy.

01:22:18.755 --> 01:22:20.129
What guy?

01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:21.713
My aunt's nephew.

01:22:22.921 --> 01:22:24.130
You have to meet yourself?

01:22:25.213 --> 01:22:26.963
Damn, brain, what the fuck?

01:22:30.671 --> 01:22:32.755
Andrei, is there something wrong?

01:22:33.421 --> 01:22:34.505
Andrei?

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.670
Andrei!

01:22:36.671 --> 01:22:37.671
Andrei!

01:22:39.671 --> 01:22:42.296
The thing is we've only been together
for two weeks

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.838
and you cannot have me this whipped, okay?

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:51.379
All good? Can I have a shower now?

01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.671
Only if you have the balls
to enter the bathroom.

01:22:57.588 --> 01:22:59.212
Maybe I'll join you in the shower.

01:22:59.213 --> 01:23:03.005
Or maybe you'll join me
in kicking your ass!

01:23:10.921 --> 01:23:12.255
We have a problem.

01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:16.254
- You forgot the onions?
- Even if I don't say anything,

01:23:16.255 --> 01:23:18.505
it doesn't mean that I don't know
something is wrong.

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.796
You're a Cancer,
you don't know how to lie.

01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:25.796
So, what's the problem?

01:23:27.171 --> 01:23:32.754
Well... You know I love pancakes, right?

01:23:32.755 --> 01:23:34.379
Do you want me to make you
some pancakes?

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.630
But I also...

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:39.921
But I also love ice cream.

01:23:42.546 --> 01:23:45.046
So what if I had to choose
between the two?

01:23:47.046 --> 01:23:51.671
What if I had to choose which desert
I want to eat for the rest of my life?

01:23:53.921 --> 01:23:55.505
All I can say is that...

01:23:56.921 --> 01:23:59.088
That's not right to play both sides.

01:24:00.713 --> 01:24:02.921
You have to decide what you want.

01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:17.130
I want pancakes.

01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:20.921
No, I want ice cream.

01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:24.088
Or pancakes.

01:24:25.005 --> 01:24:26.880
Or ice cream. I don't know.

01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:35.212
The truth is, no matter
how much you fight it,

01:24:35.213 --> 01:24:37.546
in the end you're still gonna
end up crying.

01:24:40.046 --> 01:24:42.879
- For love?
- What?

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.296
No! From the onions.

01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:52.338
But the most important thing of all
is having the right recipe.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.546
- For the meatballs?
- No.

01:24:56.755 --> 01:24:57.755
For love.

01:24:58.838 --> 01:25:02.505
Sometimes you just have to look at it
as a test you have to pass.

01:25:03.505 --> 01:25:04.879
Love?

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.713
No, the meatball, pay attention!

01:25:09.088 --> 01:25:12.420
The secret is in knowing
how to reinvent yourself.

01:25:12.421 --> 01:25:16.630
And if that doesn't work,
then you need to spice things up.

01:25:18.963 --> 01:25:20.171
The meatball?

01:25:22.255 --> 01:25:23.796
The relationship.

01:25:24.421 --> 01:25:27.088
Jesus! You're making no sense.

01:25:38.255 --> 01:25:41.380
Baby, it's very easy.

01:25:42.088 --> 01:25:45.170
If you would have liked
the pancake that much,

01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:47.463
you wouldn't have noticed
the ice cream.

01:25:49.213 --> 01:25:53.838
But if you want to taste it, it's obvious
that you like the ice cream more.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:02.505
- I love you.
- I love you too, son.

01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:05.755
But if you get the ice cream pregnant,

01:26:06.713 --> 01:26:08.588
I'll shove your dick in the grinder!

01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:21.796
You do realize we have a wardrobe,
right?

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.254
In the spring, nature wakes up.

01:26:26.255 --> 01:26:28.420
The trees become greener,

01:26:28.421 --> 01:26:31.712
the birds enchant our ears
with their lovely songs

01:26:31.713 --> 01:26:34.005
and the squirrel gets busy.

01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:38.296
You can't even imagine
how much I've missed you!

01:26:48.046 --> 01:26:50.380
This little squirrel... Sorry!

01:26:51.046 --> 01:26:56.630
This medium-sized squirrel wants
really badly to enter the hollow.

01:26:57.505 --> 01:26:59.380
Yay! He made it!

01:27:00.588 --> 01:27:03.670
Oh, yeah, the squirrel loves
the hollow!

01:27:03.671 --> 01:27:07.170
It's warm, it's cozy and it's dark.

01:27:07.171 --> 01:27:09.921
It would like to stay in the hollow
its whole life.

01:27:10.463 --> 01:27:12.962
But it can't.

01:27:12.963 --> 01:27:16.505
Usually, the squirrel can last
for about ten minutes.

01:27:17.505 --> 01:27:20.463
Fifteen minutes if it had a beer first.

01:27:21.046 --> 01:27:24.130
After that, of course,
he goes to sleep.

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:42.630
I've never had
to come so quietly before.

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:46.755
Be happy you came,
it doesn't happen too often.

01:27:49.005 --> 01:27:50.963
I feel exhausted.

01:27:52.088 --> 01:27:55.005
Sweet dreams, my artichoke!

01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:08.338
Damn! Remember when my problem
was not getting the girl?

01:28:21.255 --> 01:28:22.796
- Hi.
- Hey, hey...

01:28:27.255 --> 01:28:28.463
What are you doing here?

01:28:29.088 --> 01:28:30.796
- Let's go for a walk.
- No!

01:28:32.505 --> 01:28:34.629
I just... I couldn't sleep
because we fought,

01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:36.545
so I decided to come and see you.

01:28:36.546 --> 01:28:38.588
It's 1 am, let's talk in the morning.

01:28:39.171 --> 01:28:42.713
No! I don't want to sleep
knowing that we had a fight.

01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:45.630
And...

01:28:47.963 --> 01:28:51.130
I'm really horny. I want you.

01:28:54.546 --> 01:28:56.212
- Here and now...
- Are you insane?

01:28:56.213 --> 01:28:58.421
- What?
- The neighbors will see us.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.379
So what?

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.838
Yeah, so what?

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:28.713
Fuck off!

01:29:34.546 --> 01:29:35.838
I liked you

01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:39.338
for so many years

01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:45.629
and I've really thought you are the one
who will make me happy, but...

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.920
No, no, no, we don't need a "but."
It's okay.

01:29:48.921 --> 01:29:51.380
Sadly, we do.

01:29:53.421 --> 01:29:58.838
Because I realized my happiness
lies somewhere else.

01:30:00.005 --> 01:30:01.421
Don't say that.

01:30:03.421 --> 01:30:04.880
We can work this out.

01:30:06.255 --> 01:30:07.630
I'm sure!

01:30:08.505 --> 01:30:09.921
I'm afraid we can't.

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:19.338
Ramona, this sick, toxic thing
between us has to end.

01:30:20.296 --> 01:30:22.213
Don't you have any feelings for me?

01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:26.462
- I do.
- Yeah?

01:30:26.463 --> 01:30:27.838
I really do.

01:30:29.046 --> 01:30:30.837
But it's not love.

01:30:30.838 --> 01:30:36.630
It's not that love I always wanted and
dreamt about since I was a little boy.

01:30:37.838 --> 01:30:39.630
You cannot do this to me.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.046
I'm sorry!

01:30:44.046 --> 01:30:45.171
Wait!

01:30:52.255 --> 01:30:53.546
You bastard...

01:30:56.171 --> 01:30:57.713
How dare you?

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:09.755
It's getting late.

01:31:11.046 --> 01:31:14.963
- I have to go.
- Why? Hey!

01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:27.880
I chose the ice cream.

01:31:31.130 --> 01:31:32.130
Ow!

01:31:33.546 --> 01:31:34.796
What ice cream?

01:31:35.630 --> 01:31:39.171
Andrei!

01:31:40.963 --> 01:31:42.296
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:19.712
So, this is me now.

01:32:19.713 --> 01:32:23.504
I live in Bucharest,
I wrote a bestselling book,

01:32:23.505 --> 01:32:25.463
and everything seems perfect.

01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:28.795
Of course, I missed out
on being Ramona's boyfriend

01:32:28.796 --> 01:32:32.170
and, even though I was
madly in love with her for years,

01:32:32.171 --> 01:32:34.963
it was the best decision I ever made.

01:32:36.255 --> 01:32:40.838
Are you sure you need to go?

01:32:45.505 --> 01:32:46.671
Yeah.

01:32:49.796 --> 01:32:52.920
If I ditch him,
he'll break up with me... again.

01:32:52.921 --> 01:32:54.255
Party pooper!

01:32:54.921 --> 01:32:58.879
But don't worry,
I'll be back in... two or three hours.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.920
Okay, so be it.

01:33:00.921 --> 01:33:02.880
I'll let you cheat on me with Al.

01:33:10.338 --> 01:33:12.796
- Bye! I love you!
- I love you too!

01:33:34.671 --> 01:33:35.921
What's up, star boy?

01:33:39.088 --> 01:33:41.045
Since you've been writing
successful novels

01:33:41.046 --> 01:33:43.796
you forgot about us,
the regular people.

01:33:54.005 --> 01:33:55.296
I can't believe this!

01:33:57.005 --> 01:33:59.170
How are you?
What are you doing here?

01:33:59.171 --> 01:34:03.295
Well, I was in the area and I saw
your Facebook check-in

01:34:03.296 --> 01:34:04.545
and I said "why not?"

01:34:04.546 --> 01:34:06.630
Bring us two shots, please!

01:34:08.713 --> 01:34:10.130
So, long time no see...

01:34:10.755 --> 01:34:14.671
No phone calls, no texts,
no nothing...

01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:21.004
Yeah, sorry to disturb you, guys.
I am your biggest fan.

01:34:21.005 --> 01:34:23.545
- Can I have your autograph, please?
- Sure.

01:34:23.546 --> 01:34:24.880
My girlfriend loves you.

01:34:27.005 --> 01:34:28.463
- What...
- Alex.

01:34:31.546 --> 01:34:32.796
Thanks, thanks a lot!

01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:38.213
That just proves my point.

01:34:40.255 --> 01:34:41.880
Yeah, I suppose.

01:34:43.088 --> 01:34:47.420
But the last time we saw each other
you were... pretty pissed.

01:34:47.421 --> 01:34:50.046
Who, me? Can't remember why.

01:34:55.213 --> 01:34:56.880
I've been thinking of you, you know.

01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:03.505
It even happened when I was fucking
someone else.

01:35:05.546 --> 01:35:07.505
How fucked up is that, right?

01:35:10.005 --> 01:35:11.046
Let's not...

01:35:12.505 --> 01:35:13.838
Why not?

01:35:22.005 --> 01:35:23.005
Ramona, look...

01:35:25.338 --> 01:35:27.963
I have a girlfriend now
and I'm finally happy.

01:35:29.463 --> 01:35:30.879
So...

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.880
Yes, it was nice,
really nice seeing you...

01:35:37.005 --> 01:35:38.380
but I need to get home.

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.755
Oh, my God,
you're such a party pooper!

01:35:45.713 --> 01:35:48.088
Stay a little longer
and I'll drive you home after.

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:51.671
No, I'm... I'm okay, I'll get a cab.

01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:53.630
Wait!

01:35:54.713 --> 01:35:56.171
Did you think I was hitting on you?

01:35:59.713 --> 01:36:02.088
Andrei... I'm engaged.

01:36:03.255 --> 01:36:06.379
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. To a very nice man.

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.588
His dad owns a football team,
so relax.

01:36:09.171 --> 01:36:10.671
You have nothing to worry about.

01:36:11.755 --> 01:36:15.546
Come on, I'll drive you home
and I'll go see my fiancé.

01:36:16.463 --> 01:36:17.963
So? Shall we?

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:21.337
Ramona, you've been drinking.

01:36:21.338 --> 01:36:23.963
I don't think it's such a good idea
for you to drive.

01:36:24.463 --> 01:36:28.630
I only had two shots!
Come on, don't be such a pussy!

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.130
You'll put on your seat belt.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.963
Come on!

01:36:46.046 --> 01:36:49.505
This guy I'm seeing,
he's really something.

01:36:50.713 --> 01:36:53.255
We've just been to Barcelona
for a few days.

01:36:54.171 --> 01:36:57.338
And I think I'll go skiing to Austria.

01:36:58.421 --> 01:36:59.546
Great!

01:37:00.546 --> 01:37:03.963
It's how we roll,
from one vacation to another.

01:37:07.963 --> 01:37:12.296
And he always buys me presents.
Anything I want.

01:37:16.255 --> 01:37:18.921
You should see his mansion, it's huge!

01:37:36.796 --> 01:37:38.379
What the fuck are you doing?

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.296
I think I'm a little drunk!
But it's okay, I got this!

01:37:43.755 --> 01:37:45.713
- Ramona, pull over!
- No!

01:37:46.588 --> 01:37:47.963
Ramona, pull over!

01:37:55.963 --> 01:37:57.504
I'm gonna take you home.

01:37:57.505 --> 01:37:59.963
We wouldn't want
your girlfriend to panic, huh?

01:38:01.463 --> 01:38:02.671
I'm not worried.

01:38:03.963 --> 01:38:08.421
Just pull over so we can talk quietly.
Okay?

01:38:24.296 --> 01:38:28.255
What is wrong with you?
Why are you behaving like this?

01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:30.713
You know...

01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:36.170
- My fiancé...
- Is very rich, I got that.

01:38:36.171 --> 01:38:38.130
No... not that.

01:38:38.838 --> 01:38:40.796
I mean he is very rich, but...

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.796
Our life together isn't as perfect
as it seems.

01:38:46.755 --> 01:38:51.963
You know, the trips and the presents
could never replace feelings.

01:38:53.421 --> 01:38:54.920
What?

01:38:54.921 --> 01:38:57.588
You just told me how happy you are.

01:38:58.755 --> 01:39:00.046
You know...

01:39:00.963 --> 01:39:04.295
Sometimes I just can't help wondering

01:39:04.296 --> 01:39:06.630
how my life would have been
if we were together.

01:39:07.255 --> 01:39:09.130
You would have made me very happy.

01:39:12.755 --> 01:39:14.171
You don't know that.

01:39:16.171 --> 01:39:17.505
Oh, my God...

01:39:20.088 --> 01:39:21.380
I was so stupid.

01:39:25.338 --> 01:39:26.713
It's all my fault.

01:39:29.838 --> 01:39:32.046
If only I could take back time...

01:39:42.463 --> 01:39:44.505
Ramona, stop! What are you doing?

01:39:46.796 --> 01:39:50.796
Ramona, stop! Don't...

01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:04.213
It was impossible for me to resist.

01:40:04.838 --> 01:40:07.088
The meaning of life, you remember?

01:40:08.171 --> 01:40:11.879
If Anemona showed me heaven
while holding my hand,

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.505
then Ramona just grabbed me by
the dick and dragged me through Hell.

01:40:38.921 --> 01:40:40.005
I did a terrible thing.

01:40:44.796 --> 01:40:49.588
Ramona wanted to drive me home

01:40:50.171 --> 01:40:52.338
and... well...

01:40:55.546 --> 01:40:57.005
That bitch stole your wallet?

01:40:58.255 --> 01:41:00.880
She sucked my cock, you cock sucker!

01:41:01.463 --> 01:41:02.838
Alin!

01:41:05.171 --> 01:41:07.005
I found this under your pillow.

01:41:09.421 --> 01:41:12.005
Yes, I have that
so I can spank you later.

01:41:20.588 --> 01:41:23.670
I can't believe I cheated on Anemona.

01:41:23.671 --> 01:41:24.796
So what?

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:27.213
Shit happens.

01:41:27.838 --> 01:41:31.380
Just text her you're sleeping at my place
and tomorrow you'll go home

01:41:32.838 --> 01:41:34.338
and we'll never speak of this again.

01:41:35.755 --> 01:41:37.713
Why do you have this in your room?

01:41:38.963 --> 01:41:42.046
I have that so you can spank me later.

01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:48.546
But I have to tell her. It's only fair.

01:41:49.796 --> 01:41:50.796
Yo!

01:41:55.796 --> 01:42:00.171
I was in your shoes a long time ago
and I chose honesty.

01:42:01.671 --> 01:42:03.171
Do you wanna know what happened?

01:42:03.963 --> 01:42:05.421
She killed my hamster.

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.713
She cooked it and fed it to me.

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.920
Jesus!

01:42:11.921 --> 01:42:12.921
Alin!

01:42:25.463 --> 01:42:26.671
Anemona!

01:42:31.838 --> 01:42:33.213
Anemona?

01:43:18.671 --> 01:43:20.754
Well, boo-fucking-hoo!

01:43:20.755 --> 01:43:23.505
What kind of a comedy
doesn't have a happy ending?

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.129
Anemona? Is that you?

01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:34.504
No, it's not Anemona, you dumb-ass!

01:43:34.505 --> 01:43:36.921
Look at you, crying like a little girl.

01:43:37.588 --> 01:43:41.504
"Oh, Anemona, where are you?
Please don't leave me!"

01:43:41.505 --> 01:43:44.754
I don't know who you are,
I don't know what you want...

01:43:44.755 --> 01:43:47.337
But if you don't tell me,
I will look for you,

01:43:47.338 --> 01:43:50.671
I will find you and I will kill you!

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:59.420
The speech from "Taken"? Seriously?

01:43:59.421 --> 01:44:01.130
How ridiculously stupid!

01:44:02.046 --> 01:44:03.170
Holy shit!

01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:07.588
Hey, watch your mouth
in the presence of... the Almighty!

01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:10.504
You disgusting sinner!

01:44:10.505 --> 01:44:12.213
Let's try this!

01:44:14.005 --> 01:44:15.712
How did you do that?

01:44:15.713 --> 01:44:18.962
If I'm God,
I guess you must be Jesus.

01:44:18.963 --> 01:44:21.921
You know, you can walk on water.
Come on, try it!

01:44:25.088 --> 01:44:28.130
- What a dumb motherfucker!
- Who the hell are you?

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.755
You haven't figured it out by now?
I'm future you, buddy.

01:44:33.796 --> 01:44:35.380
If you are me, then fuck you!

01:44:36.213 --> 01:44:38.755
I mean... fuck me! Whatever!

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:41.505
Wait!

01:44:42.963 --> 01:44:46.005
- You can take me wherever I want?
- Where do you wanna go?

01:44:52.671 --> 01:44:56.421
So... You gonna hook up with her?

01:44:57.463 --> 01:44:58.463
You know what?

01:45:01.713 --> 01:45:02.713
Fuck you, dude!

01:45:08.588 --> 01:45:11.629
You do know you could've
just gone back to last night

01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:15.005
and not got blown by Ramona, right?
