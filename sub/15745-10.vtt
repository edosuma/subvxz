LEAVING WITH AN ARSENAL
OF WEAPONS

01:21.130 --> 01:23.100
AND A BAFFLED
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.370

01:25.440 --> 01:28.410

01:53.960 --> 01:57.670
THE ONLY SUBSTANCE
THAT CAN TOTALLY STRIP AWAY
YOUR SUPERPOWERS.

01:57.730 --> 01:59.600
WHAT MORE POWERFUL WEAPON
TO HAVE

01:59.670 --> 02:03.340

PUT THE LOONATICS OUT
OF BUSINESS FOR GOOD?

02:03.410 --> 02:05.310

05:14.000 --> 05:15.030
SPEECH IMPEDIM-M-ME--

05:15.100 --> 05:16.570
CAN'T TALK RIGHT, HUH?

05:19.270 --> 05:20.900
- DUCK'S TOLD US
ALL ABOUT YOU.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.470
WELL, HE'S ACTUALLY NEVER
TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,

05:22.540 --> 05:23.710
BUT I'M SURE HE
WANTED TO TELL US ABOUT YOU,

05:23.770 --> 05:24.910
BUT HE NEVER GOT
AROUND TO TELLING IT.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.040
- MAYBE IF WE GAVE
PINKSTER A CHANCE,

05:27.110 --> 05:28.410
HE COULD FULL US IN.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.520

05:31.580 --> 05:33.720

WELL, THEY WEREN'T
ALWAYS GOOD,

05:40.590 --> 05:41.860
BUT THEY WERE OLD.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.930
Pinkster: IT WAS DOWN TO,
UH, B-B, ONE LAST COUPLE.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.430
SINCE IT WAS SUCH A B-BI--
UH, BIG DECISION,

05:49.500 --> 05:51.600
I SUGGESTED
WE FLIP A COIN.

05:51.670 --> 05:55.470
- HEADS, YOU GET ME.
TAILS, YOU GET PINK-STUFF.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.380
Pinkster: IT CAME UP HEADS,

05:59.440 --> 06:01.850
AND D-DUH-- UH, DUCK
WAS THE LUCKY ONE.

06:05.850 --> 06:09.120
- SO, HOW LONG WAS IT
BEFORE YOU WERE CHOSEN?

06:09.190 --> 06:10.120
- HMM.

06:10.190 --> 06:13.160
UH, THAT WOULD BE N-NEVER.

06:13.220 --> 06:16.030
NO ONE EVER ADOPTED YOU?

06:16.090 --> 06:17.390
- I-IT'S OK.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.130
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
UH, Y-YOU MADE IT OUT,

06:20.200 --> 06:21.530
AND NOW LOOK AT YOU.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.500

06:23.570 --> 06:24.800
- AW, SHUCKS.

06:24.870 --> 06:27.870
WELL, IT'S NOT EASY KEEPIN'
A GREAT BIRD DOWN.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.540
- UH, YOU GUYS ARE SURE LUCKY
DOING WHAT YOU DO.

06:30.610 --> 06:33.510
I WASN'T SO LUCKY
F-FINDING MY CALLING.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.780
I TRIED MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS,

06:36.850 --> 06:39.680
B-B-BU-- UH, B-BUT THINGS
DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT.

06:39.750 --> 06:40.950

AAH!

06:54.300 --> 06:56.600
UH, B-B-BUT I DID LEARN
ONE THING.

06:56.670 --> 06:58.770
N-N-NEVER GIVE UP

06:58.840 --> 07:02.010
SO I BECAME A P-P-POLI--
POLI-P-P-- UH...

07:02.070 --> 07:02.840

07:04.570 --> 07:06.210
I MEAN, LOOK AT YA.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.440

07:08.510 --> 07:10.010
WHENEVER I'M
NOT SURE OF MYSELF,

07:10.080 --> 07:12.650
I HAVE A LITTLE TRICK
TO GIVE ME COURAGE.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.550
- YOU FOUND COURAGE
IN A CAN?

07:14.620 --> 07:17.290
- ALL I GOT TO DO IS
LOOK AT MY CAN AND SAY,

07:17.350 --> 07:19.620
"I, UH, C-CAN DO IT!"

07:19.690 --> 07:23.930
UH, S-SO I WAS WONDERING
IF I CAN WORK WITH YOU GUYS

07:23.990 --> 07:25.800
AND HELP YOU CATCH
STONEY AND BUGSY?

07:25.860 --> 07:28.600
AFTER ALL, IT WAS MY FAULT
THEY GOT AWAY.

07:28.670 --> 07:32.070
I--I MEAN, YOU ARE THE ONE
IN CHARGE?

07:33.400 --> 07:35.400
UH...WELL, UH, YEAH,
BUT, UH...

07:35.470 --> 07:36.810
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT,

07:36.870 --> 07:38.940
AND I DO MY BEST THINKIN'
OVER THERE.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.680
- SO, ACE, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
OL' PAL, OL' BUD?

07:45.750 --> 07:46.880
BY THE WAY, DID I EVER TELL YOU

07:46.950 --> 07:48.920
HOW MUCH I REALLY
DIG THOSE EARS?

07:48.990 --> 07:49.950
- HMM!

07:50.020 --> 07:53.860
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.530
- BUT I CAN TRAIN HIM
MYSELF.

07:55.590 --> 07:56.760
BY THE TIME I'M DONE,

07:56.830 --> 07:58.600
IT'LL BE LIKE HAVING
2 DUCKS AROUND.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.960
NO, NO, NO, MAYBE 3.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.100

08:15.610 --> 08:17.580

10:06.660 --> 10:08.520
GUARDIN' A BANK

10:09.860 --> 10:12.160
CARROTS BRING OUT

11:03.610 --> 11:05.350
TONIGHT ON ACME-T,

11:05.410 --> 11:07.080
WE EXAMINE THE LOONATICS--

11:07.150 --> 11:09.520
A DYNAMIC TEAM
OF CRIME STOPPERS.

11:09.590 --> 11:11.390
ARE THEY ACTION HEROES,

11:11.450 --> 11:13.120
OR ACTION ZEROES?

11:13.190 --> 11:16.930
AFTER YEARS OF PROTECTING
ITS CITIZENS AGAINST
RAMPAGING DINOSAURS,

11:16.990 --> 11:18.930
SPIDER CREATURES,
ROCK MONSTERS,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.900
AND INVADERS
FROM OUTER SPACE,

11:20.960 --> 11:23.030
THEY SEEM TO HAVE LOST
THEIR EDGE.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.000
IN RECENT SECURITY FOOTAGE,

11:25.070 --> 11:27.900
THE LOONATICS HAVE FAILED
AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP

11:27.970 --> 11:29.910
THE CRIME WAVE
OF BUGSY THE BUG

11:29.970 --> 11:31.910
AND STONEY THE STONE.

11:31.980 --> 11:34.710
AND ON YESTERDAY'S FOOTAGE,
ANOTHER DISASTER,

11:34.780 --> 11:38.820
TAKING THEMSELVES OUT
AFTER HAVING THE DROP
ON THE TWO PERPETRATORS.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.820
AND WHO IS THEIR
PLUCKY NEW SIDEKICK?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.350
WITH HELP LIKE THIS,

11:42.420 --> 11:45.450
IT'S NO WONDER THE BAD GUYS
ARE WINNING THE WAR ON WEAPONS.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.060
Danger Duck: HOW CAN HE SAY THAT
ABOUT PINKSTER?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.490
HE'S A HERO IN TRAINING.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.700
- ONE MOMENT.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.160
WE HAVE NEW
EYE ON ACME-T FOOTAGE

11:55.230 --> 11:57.870
OF YET ANOTHER BOTCHED
APPREHENSION THIS AFTERNOON,

11:57.930 --> 11:59.740
AS STONEY AND BUGSY
WERE ROBBING

11:59.800 --> 12:01.670
YET ANOTHER ARSENAL WAREHOUSE.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.570
- I, UH, G-GOT 'EM.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.140
OOPS!

12:07.210 --> 12:09.010
- HEH HEH HEH!

12:15.580 --> 12:17.890
- OH! UH, UH...

12:21.290 --> 12:22.830
- WHOA!

12:43.950 --> 12:45.610
- HEH HEH HEH...HA HA HA!

12:45.680 --> 12:49.650
- ONCE AGAIN, STONEY AND BUGSY
HAVE LEFT THE LOONATICS, WELL...

12:49.720 --> 12:51.820
LOOKING JUST PLAIN LOONY.

12:51.890 --> 12:54.260
- LISTEN, DUCK,
PINKSTER MEANS WELL,

12:54.320 --> 12:58.160
BUT I'M AFRAID THINGS
JUST AREN'T WORKIN' OUT.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.460
- I KNOW OLD PORK LOIN'S
NOT PERFECT,

13:01.530 --> 13:03.570
BUT MAYBE IT'S OUR FAULT
FOR NOT FINDING OUT

13:03.630 --> 13:04.870
WHAT HE'S GOOD AT.

13:04.930 --> 13:06.900
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS SIDE OF YOU, DUCK.

13:06.970 --> 13:10.170
CARING SO MUCH ABOUT SOMEONE
OTHER THAN NUMERO UNO?

13:10.240 --> 13:13.510
- YEAH. I HAVE A FEELIN'
THERE'S MORE GOIN' ON HERE

13:13.580 --> 13:15.010
THAN DUCK
DEVELOPING A HEART.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.480
SO WHAT GIVES, GANDHI?

13:16.550 --> 13:19.920
- OK. THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
I FORGOT TO MENTION BEFORE.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.950
WHEN THE COUPLE AT THE ORPHANAGE
FLIPPED A COIN

13:22.020 --> 13:23.250
TO SEE WHO WOULD BE PICKED...

13:23.320 --> 13:26.990
- HEADS, YOU GET ME,
TAILS, YOU GET PINK-STUFF.

13:30.790 --> 13:33.260
- WHAT NO ONE KNEW WAS...

13:33.330 --> 13:35.930
IT WAS MY LUCKY TWO-HEADED COIN.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.300
IT'S BEEN MY FOURTH-DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET

13:38.370 --> 13:40.540
THAT COST ME
MANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.170
WELL, AT LEAST TWO.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.570
- ONCE AGAIN, THE WORLD OF DUCK
MAKES SENSE.

13:51.050 --> 13:54.980
- I'M SORRY FOR BEING
SO MUCH TROUB-BE-BE--TROUB-B-B--

13:55.050 --> 13:56.350
SUCH A SCREW-UP.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.520
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I CAN HONESTLY SAY

13:59.590 --> 14:02.590
THAT YOU'VE DONE BETTER
THAN ANY OF US EVER EXPECTED.

14:02.660 --> 14:03.690
RIGHT?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.700
- PINKSTER, YOU'RE BEING
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

14:07.760 --> 14:12.270
- THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT MAKES HIM
SUCH A PERFECTIONIST, LIKE ME.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.110
- UH, SO DO YOU THINK
I CAN HELP YOU TOMORROW

14:16.170 --> 14:18.670
GUARD THE, UH, C

14:18.740 --> 14:21.310
HMM...

14:21.380 --> 14:22.350
WELL, SURE.

14:22.410 --> 14:24.410
THERE'S NO ONE I'D RATHER
HAVE AT MY SIDE

14:24.480 --> 14:26.220
THAN THE MAN IN PINK.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.950
- WOW. THANKS, GUYS,
FOR BELIEVING IN ME.

14:29.020 --> 14:31.490
I PROMISE YOU I CAN D-DO IT.

14:31.550 --> 14:33.120
UH, G-G-GEE!

14:37.590 --> 14:39.600
Ace: YOU READY, SLAM?

14:39.660 --> 14:41.260
REV?

14:41.330 --> 14:44.530
- THIS IS WHERE THE CURIUM 247
WILL BE STORED.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.600
NOTHING CAN GET PAST
THE ACME ALERT 3000.

14:47.670 --> 14:48.600
I SHOULD KNOW.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.810
I DESIGNED IT.

14:49.870 --> 14:52.340
- DOESN'T LOOK SO
IMPENETRABIBBLE TO ME.

14:53.410 --> 14:54.480
YEOW!

14:57.010 --> 14:59.220
- HIYA, GUYS! I'M HERE!

14:59.280 --> 15:02.820
L-L-LOOK! I BROUGHT
D-D-DOUGHNUTS.

15:02.890 --> 15:03.820
- THANKS, PINKSTER,

15:03.890 --> 15:06.220
BUT WHERE ARE THE DOUGHNUTS?

15:06.290 --> 15:09.230
- I, UH, GU-GUESS I GOT
A LITTLE HUNGRY ON THE WAY OVER.

15:09.290 --> 15:10.030
HUH?

15:12.530 --> 15:14.960
- LOOKS LIKE THE CURIUM'S
RIGHT ON TIME.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.930
- SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.700
STAND HERE AND DON'T MOVE.

15:21.770 --> 15:24.010
- ST-STAND AND DON'T MOVE.

15:24.070 --> 15:27.510
YES, I C-CAN DO THAT.

15:37.850 --> 15:38.920
I C-CAN DO IT.

15:38.990 --> 15:41.220
I C-CAN DO IT!

15:42.090 --> 15:44.060
HUH? OOPS!

15:44.130 --> 15:46.300
I DROPPED MY CAN.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.110
M-MY CAN! M-MY CAN!

16:14.690 --> 16:16.130
- TECH, DO SOMETHING!

16:16.190 --> 16:18.460
- I'M DISABLING SECURITY.

16:25.830 --> 16:26.770
Danger Duck: GREAT!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.100
- WHOA!

16:28.170 --> 16:31.170
- HMM, LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT A DELIVERY,

16:31.240 --> 16:32.910
AND I DON'T MEAN
FROM THE STORK.

16:32.980 --> 16:34.840
- IT'S DA HEAT! WE BEEN MADE!

16:34.910 --> 16:37.710
WE GOTTA GET TO THE CURIUM,
AND FAST!

16:37.780 --> 16:41.280
- DUH, WHATEVER YOU SAY, BOSS.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.520
- NOT THAT FAST!

16:44.590 --> 16:47.790
Both: AAH!

16:49.890 --> 16:52.160
- UHH! UHH!

16:53.560 --> 16:56.030
Danger Duck: GREAT! THE CURIUM'S
MAKING IT INTO THE VAULT.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.670
- IF THE EINSTEIN TWINS
REACH THE VAULT FIRST,

17:00.740 --> 17:03.470
OUR BUTTS ARE GONNA GLOW
BRIGHTER THAN A FULL MOON.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.080
- REV AND TECH ARE AT THE VAULT.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.250
STONEY AND BUGSY SLIPPED IN

17:09.310 --> 17:11.410
WHILE THE SYSTEM
WAS SHUT DOWN!

17:11.480 --> 17:14.480
HEAR THAT, YOU TWO?
DANGER DUCK IS ON YOUR CASE!

17:22.160 --> 17:23.930
- WHEN THE BOYS TURN THE CORNER,

17:23.990 --> 17:25.890
THEY'LL FACE
THE TECH-NABBER 7000.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.060
- THAT'S A FAR IMPROVEMENT
FROM THE TECH-NABBER 6000.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.200
IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT--

17:29.270 --> 17:31.400
- WHOA! WHOA!

17:31.470 --> 17:33.000
- COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,
BUT JUST EXACTLY THE SAME,

17:33.070 --> 17:33.800
BUT DIFFERENT.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.000
- SHUDDUP.

17:35.070 --> 17:36.070
- AND IT'S MARKED 7000
INSTEAD OF 6000,

17:36.140 --> 17:37.140
AND FROM THIS BIRD'S-EYE VIEW,

17:37.210 --> 17:38.140
I'D CALL THAT PRETTY DIFFERENT.

17:38.210 --> 17:39.540
- SHUDDUP SHUTTIN' UP.

17:39.610 --> 17:41.140
- THANK YOU.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.250
- TIME TO CRACK OPEN
DIS OYSTER.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.920
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA OPEN A SAFE.

17:49.990 --> 17:52.090
- CLAM UP
AND GET TO WORK.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.620
- NNH!

18:01.760 --> 18:02.730
WHOA!

18:08.200 --> 18:10.170
- DROP THE BLADE, RABBIT.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.040
- EEH!

18:14.110 --> 18:16.950
- LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BACK TO THE POKY.

18:17.010 --> 18:18.280
- UH, D-DON'T WORRY, ACE.

18:18.350 --> 18:19.950
I'LL, UH, ST-STOP THEM!

18:20.020 --> 18:22.150
- NO, PINKSTER!
D-D-D-DON'T!

18:22.220 --> 18:23.850
- HEY, LOOK, I FOUND MY C-CA--

18:23.920 --> 18:25.550
- UGH!

18:27.890 --> 18:29.090
- BACK OFF!

18:29.160 --> 18:32.430
ANYONE TRIES ANYTHING
AND PORK CHOP GETS IT.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.730
- DON'T WORRY, PORK CHOP--

18:33.800 --> 18:34.830
I MEAN, PINKSTER--

18:34.900 --> 18:35.930
WE'LL SAVE YA!

18:36.000 --> 18:38.030
JUST DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.270
- YOU, LONG EARS,

18:39.340 --> 18:40.770
OPEN DA SAFE.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.040
- EH, I DON'T THINK SO.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.440
- UH, B-B-UH--
B-BETTER DO AS HE SAYS.

18:44.510 --> 18:46.440
- AND MAKE IT FAST, RABBIT.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.290
NOW DROP IT.

18:56.350 --> 18:58.050
I SAID DROP IT!

18:58.120 --> 18:59.560
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, MUNCHKIN.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.860
- OW! OW, OW, OW!

19:02.930 --> 19:04.290
OW!

19:04.360 --> 19:06.360
- UH, B-UH, B-UH, GOT IT.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.900
- WAY TO GO, PINKSTER.

19:11.430 --> 19:13.500
PINKSTER

19:13.570 --> 19:16.310
- I D-DON'T GO
BY PINKSTER NO MORE.

19:16.370 --> 19:17.870
TH-THAT WAS MY ORPHAN NAME.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.480
I'M NOW P-PINK THE PUG.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.610
TH-THE JIG'S UP, RODENT.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.780
HANDS OF THE CREW!

19:23.850 --> 19:26.150
Danger Duck: PINKSTER?
YOU'RE WITH THEM?

19:26.220 --> 19:28.980
- YEAH. THESE ARE MY TORPEDOES,

19:29.050 --> 19:30.990
STONEY AND B-B-BUGSY.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.920
- BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WITH US.

19:32.990 --> 19:35.260
- HA HA HA! I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FELL FOR THAT.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.090
WH-WH-WHAT A SAP!

19:39.730 --> 19:40.900
- LET'S SEE.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.000
WOULD A BAD GUY D

19:44.100 --> 19:45.930
- WHOA! UNH!

19:50.640 --> 19:51.710
- NO! NO!

19:51.770 --> 19:53.640
I GUESS I AM.

19:53.710 --> 19:54.740
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

19:54.810 --> 19:56.250
- ACE!

19:56.310 --> 19:59.850
- LOSING POWERS!
CAN'T BREATHE!

19:59.920 --> 20:01.180
GOOD-BYE.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.320
- UHH!

20:02.390 --> 20:06.050
- UH, TH-TH-THAT'S ALL,
L-LOONATICS.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.860
N-NOW THAT ME AND MY BOYS
GOT THE CURIUM,

20:15.930 --> 20:16.870
ACMETROP-P-P--

20:16.930 --> 20:18.000
ACMETROP-P-P---

20:18.070 --> 20:19.600
THIS PLACE'LL BE ALL OURS.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.570
- EH, SORRY TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE THERE, PORK CHOP,

20:22.640 --> 20:25.910
BUT CONSIDER YOURSELVES
INCARCERATED.

20:27.210 --> 20:29.910
SO HOW'D YOU F

20:29.980 --> 20:32.320
- I FIRST GOT SUSPICIOUS
WHEN YOU ASKED TO GUARD

20:32.380 --> 20:34.120
THE CURIUM 247.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.980
HOW'D YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT?

20:36.050 --> 20:37.250
IT WAS TOP SECRET.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.590
AND THEN, I DID
SOME CHECKING,

20:39.660 --> 20:41.590
AND THINGS DIDN'T CHECK OUT.

20:41.660 --> 20:43.790
LIKE ALL THE JOBS HE CLAIMED.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.560
THERE WAS NO RECORD OF HIM
EVER WORKIN' ANYWHERE,

20:46.630 --> 20:49.800
NOT EVEN AT THE ACMETROPOLIS
POLICE ACADEMY.

20:49.870 --> 20:52.340
AND WHEN I DID SOME SNOOPIN'
AT THE HOME,

20:52.400 --> 20:54.600
IT TURNS OUT
OUR LITTLE ORPHAN HAMMY

20:54.670 --> 20:57.510
WAS ADOPTED THE DAY
AFTER DUCK LEFT...

20:57.570 --> 20:59.740
BY STONEY AND BUGSY.

20:59.810 --> 21:02.680
BUT THE TOPPER
WAS YOUR "I CAN" CAN.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.250
WHILE WE THOUGHT WE WERE
TRACKIN' STONEY AND BUGSY,

21:05.310 --> 21:07.820
THEY WERE TRACKIN' US.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.450
- UNH! DOH!

21:09.520 --> 21:12.050
- WITH A BUILT-IN TRANSMITTER.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.120
- J-JUST ONE THING
I DON'T GET.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.190
THE CURIUM 247,
HOW'D YOU BEAT IT?

21:17.260 --> 21:19.260
- THE REAL CURIUM
WAS DELIVERED YESTERDAY.

21:19.330 --> 21:21.960
I USED THE FAKE STUFF
TO EXPOSE YOU

21:22.030 --> 21:24.370
BEFORE YOU COULD EXPOSE ME.

21:24.430 --> 21:26.540
- IF ONLY I DIDN'T
SWITCH COINS.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.470
PINKSTER WOULDN'T HAVE
WOUND UP A CRIMINAL.

21:28.540 --> 21:31.740
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN...ME.

21:31.810 --> 21:33.210
- HEH HEH HEH HEH!

21:33.280 --> 21:34.740
WH-WHAT A PALOOKA.

21:34.810 --> 21:37.150
THE FIX WAS IN FOR ME
TO BE ADOPTED

21:37.210 --> 21:38.750
BY BUGSY AND STONEY
ALL ALONG.

21:38.810 --> 21:42.490
I WAS W-WORRIED
THAT SOME GOODY TWO-SHOES
WOULD PICK ME.

21:42.550 --> 21:44.750
THAT'S WHY IS SUGGESTED
A FLIP OF A COIN.

21:44.820 --> 21:47.090
I KN-KNEW YOU HAD
A TWO-HEADED COIN

21:47.160 --> 21:49.120
AND W-WOULDN'T HESITATE
TO USE IT.

21:49.190 --> 21:50.460
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

21:50.530 --> 21:53.200
- JUST THE SAME, I THINK
THERE'S STILL SOME GOOD

21:53.260 --> 21:54.300
IN OLD BACON BITS.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.430
MAYBE HE COULD BE
REHABILITATED.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.730
MAYBE HE CAN STILL
CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.070
MAYBE ONE DAY, HE'LL PROVE
TO BE A MODEL CITIZEN.

22:02.140 --> 22:03.240
MAYBE--WHOA!

22:03.310 --> 22:06.040
- M-M-MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SHUT IT, DUCK.

22:06.110 --> 22:07.280
TH-TH-THIS AIN'T--

22:07.340 --> 22:09.140
TH-TH-THIS AIN'T--

22:09.210 --> 22:11.810
THIS AIN'T OVER, FOLKS.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.780
HEH HEH HEH HEH!
