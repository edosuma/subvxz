11:02.929 --> 11:04.863
and whatever.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.372
(phone rings)

11:17.109 --> 11:18.677
Hello.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.811
COOKIE:
Let me in.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.912
Who's this?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.950
Let me in.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.319
Y'all better have
a elevator up in here.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.688
My feet hurt.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.526
Go in there
and tell your mama I love her,

11:34.528 --> 11:36.094
and don't come
back here crying.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.638
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

11:48.007 --> 11:50.675
When you coming home, Mama?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.911
I told you to stop
asking me that.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.180
Where's your father?

11:55.182 --> 11:58.850
He's not coming
to see you today.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.386
Yeah, okay.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.689
How you doing in school,
little man?

12:04.691 --> 12:07.058
My friends are picking on me.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.526
Bashir stole my lunch.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.161
I'm afraid to tell Dad.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.563
He'll tell me to fight.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.998
Listen to me.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.001
You different.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.770
Okay?

12:18.772 --> 12:21.940
It's only something
Mama knows, but

12:21.942 --> 12:25.777
it's gonna make life hard
for you sometimes.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.780
But I want you to always
remember I got you.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.882
You hear me?

12:30.884 --> 12:33.351
Come here.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.788
I got you.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.190
Okay?

12:39.192 --> 12:40.592
Hey, she's coming.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.361
Oh, my God. How?

12:43.363 --> 12:44.796
I don't know.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.898
Did you tell her
about us?

12:46.900 --> 12:48.867
Um...
And this.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.336
Take that.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.274
(doors clack open)

12:57.476 --> 12:59.878
Oh.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.781
(sighs)

13:02.783 --> 13:05.283
Mmm.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.990
For a queen, you sure
do keep a messy place.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.759
What you need is a
good maid up in here.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.995
You cooking chicken?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.997
Oh, yeah, yeah. Um...
Did you fry it?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.332
No, it's stewed, but it's
here this way.  Stewed?

13:21.334 --> 13:23.468
Might be a little spicy for you.
Stewed chicken.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.570
It's the way
we like it, so, you know.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.939
Uh, who is this?
Hi.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.474
Oh. That's Michael.
Michael.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.609
Uh, we're sort of
living together.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.845
Uh, look, Mommy,
I know you're hungry.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.780
Oh. Oh, honey,
you didn't tell me

13:35.782 --> 13:37.649
you was dating
a little Mexican.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.150
Look at her.
She's adorable.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.852
Yeah, I said "a little
Mexican." (Michael laughs)

13:40.854 --> 13:43.488
You need to get La Cucaracha
to clean up around here a bit.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.923
Uh, what are
you wearing?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.324
(sighs)
What I got locked up in.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.992
Well, we gonna
change that real quick.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.627
And why didn't you call me?
I would have picked you up.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.830
I just got out.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.464
Good behavior.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.466
All right, so,

13:55.468 --> 13:57.068
what are you gonna do now?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.873
I'm here to get what's mine.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.946
BECKY:
<i> You can't just go in there.</i>

14:07.948 --> 14:10.415
Get your ass
out of the way.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.581
(door opens)

14:43.583 --> 14:46.651
Ladies and gentlemen,
the queen has returned.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.191
Wow.

14:53.193 --> 14:57.996
17 years later, and
you are still beautiful.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.033
So, when did you get out?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.601
Two days ago.

15:03.603 --> 15:07.338
You really, uh...

15:07.340 --> 15:10.074
It was your sacrifice that made
a lot of this possible.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.480
I can't imagine what
you've been through, Cookie.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.516
But you've got to know

15:18.518 --> 15:21.586
you're not the only one
that suffered in this.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.756
You forgot about me the second
you divorced me in there.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.859
You still owe me what's mine.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.394
What are you talking about?

15:29.396 --> 15:31.729
Half of this company.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.432
It was my $400,000
that started this bitch.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.867
You know it,

15:35.869 --> 15:37.568
and I know it.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.370
Did 17 hard years
for that money,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.773
and I want half my company back.

15:41.775 --> 15:45.376
(laughing): I'm sorry, Cookie,
but it don't work like that.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.612
It don't work like what, honey?

15:47.614 --> 15:51.149
This company isn't the company
that we started 17 years ago.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.951
As a matter of fact,

15:52.953 --> 15:55.820
I control maybe ten percent
of this damn thing.

15:55.822 --> 15:59.123
I've got a board of directors,
quarterly reports, SEC filings.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.825
And on top of it,

16:00.827 --> 16:03.261
we're about to go public,
which is a whole nother monster

16:03.263 --> 16:05.330
in itself. Public? What
the hell is public?

16:06.899 --> 16:09.267
Baby, I can give you

16:09.269 --> 16:13.071
a huge salary,

16:13.073 --> 16:15.606
but I can't give you
half of my company.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.976
<i> Your? Your</i> company? I
can't give you any of it.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.278
This is my company, Lucious.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.581
I s...! I started this.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.085
You need to stop
playing with me.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.988
I promise you, anything
you want, you can get.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.457
$5 million... a year,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.592
and I want to be head of A&R.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.494
The board will never
approve $5 million.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.929
You talk to your board.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.530
I can get you close
to $3 million.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.999
Yeah, figure it out.
You the boss.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.101
I can't do A&R.
Why?

16:45.037 --> 16:47.538
I have someone.

16:52.644 --> 16:55.713
Is it little Halle Berry
over here?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.515
(sighs)

17:03.222 --> 17:06.224
You're not sweeping me
under the carpet, Lucious.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.227
(door opens)  ANIKA:  Baby,

17:09.229 --> 17:11.662
we got to make sure we take care...

you kept me from her.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.193
I don't know that woman.

You're just like her.

You know, when, uh,

19:25.198 --> 19:28.432
Cookie got sent away,
the judge told us 30 years.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.302
Now, I was devastated.
Thank you, baby.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.205
I didn't know nothing
about raising y'all.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.840
Cookie did all of that.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.708
Give me that tissue.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.111
Thank you.

19:40.113 --> 19:44.782
Anyway, Dottie came along,
fell for me hard,

19:44.784 --> 19:46.817
said she wanted
to raise y'all.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.153
You weren't even one yet.

19:49.155 --> 19:52.223
And Cookie didn't want y'all
visiting her in jail,

19:52.225 --> 19:53.891
and that was fine
with Dottie.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.726
What I'm saying is...

19:55.728 --> 19:58.462
your mama wasn't
a bad person.

19:58.464 --> 20:02.333
We just was in a real bad
situation, you know.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.969
Whatever happened
to Miss Dottie?

20:04.971 --> 20:08.973
She got shot
on 42nd and Walnut.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.844
You need to get your act together.
(sighs)

20:13.846 --> 20:16.214
You gonna pull out a phone
when I'm talking to you?

20:16.216 --> 20:19.550
But you're wasting your
talents on bitches and booze.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.085
I'm working on new stuff now,
and you know that.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.054
You ain't worked a day
in your life,

20:23.056 --> 20:26.057
and you know that.
You're spoiled.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.760
But I got some new heat for you,
some stuff that I wrote.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.429
We gonna go in
and record it,

20:31.431 --> 20:33.598
and we gonna put some candy
on this thing.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.000
You feel me?

20:36.002 --> 20:38.636
Candy.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.673
(snoring)

20:54.419 --> 20:56.921
What you doing here?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.623
You look a mess.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.058
You been drinking again,
ain't you, Bunkie?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.126
Now look at you.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.928
Get that mess off your face.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.531
What's going on, Bunkie?

21:07.533 --> 21:09.634
I'll tell you
what's going on.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.435
Lucious keeping me down.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.204
And we used to be
like brothers.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.705
You know what I'm saying?

21:14.707 --> 21:17.575
Now he treats me
like I'm the butler.

21:17.577 --> 21:23.281
Practically raised the
kids while you was inside.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.549
Yeah. You're right.

21:25.551 --> 21:28.419
I appreciate you
for that, too, Bunkie.

21:28.421 --> 21:32.490
Lucious got you
following me, don't he?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.925
Don't he?

21:34.927 --> 21:37.728
What you gonna tell him?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.431
I didn't see you.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.133
My dawg.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.602
Hey, something's going on.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.237
I don't know what it is.

21:46.239 --> 21:48.139
Got... it's got him scared.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.008
Well, you best be careful,
'cause he's on a warpath.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.843
Liable to do anything.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.613
I got his war.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.315
Give me that sandwich.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.749
I can't finish that?

21:58.751 --> 22:01.085
Man, hop on the treadmill.
(laughs)

22:01.087 --> 22:03.487
First of all, who goes to
bathhouses anymore, and... Me.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.356
No, but how'd you
even get into it?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.958
I told 'em I was pre-op,
and they didn't want to check.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.660
LUCIOUS: Them papers on
my desk I need to sign?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.095
Mm-hmm. Your son's here.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.963
Hey, Mal.
Hey.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.365
How's that roommate

22:14.367 --> 22:16.801
of yours, the one
with the dreads?
