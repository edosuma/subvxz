GEORGIE: Previously,
on "Heartland."

00:04.754 --> 00:06.131
 That is Will's guitar.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.757
 He's gone, Jack.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.759
Our dear Will passed away.

00:09.884 --> 00:13.013
 Maya tells me you're bringing
Fred as a guest to the wedding.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.306
 I'm not bringing
anyone because, um, I

00:15.432 --> 00:16.306
don't think I can be there.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.268
 I want you at my wedding.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.020
 We're trapped, aren't we?

00:20.145 --> 00:23.106
If I miss this event tomorrow,
there is no European tour, OK?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.607
TIM: There's something
I need to say.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.068
I know what I put
you through, Marion,

00:27.193 --> 00:28.570
what I put our family through.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.989
And today's not
about looking back,

00:31.114 --> 00:32.156
it's about moving forward.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.324
 Is everything OK?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.035
 It's Luke's mother.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.370
She doesn't feel that she
can take care of him anymore.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.706
I'm afraid I'm looking
into foster care.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.715
[music playing]

01:01.728 --> 01:03.271
LYNDY: [babbles]

01:06.483 --> 01:07.567
AMY: Yeah?

01:07.692 --> 01:09.944
 I think we should
give this back to Luke.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.448
 Why, he wanted us to have it.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.033
 Yeah, well, what if
we never see him again.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.910
I think he should have it.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.205
 Ty, I'm pretty sure we're
going to see Luke again.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.293
 Not if he ends up
in foster care, Amy.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.882
It could be in a different
city, far away from a school,

01:31.007 --> 01:31.800
far away from us.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.597
[sighs] Luke's a sensitive kid.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.808
This is going to be a
tough transition for him.

01:43.061 --> 01:43.812
ANDREA: Let's go, sunshine.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.401
 Mom?

01:49.526 --> 01:50.985
Where are we going?

01:51.111 --> 01:56.741
 Um, I don't know, but that
is why it's so exciting.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.243
It's an adventure.

01:58.368 --> 02:02.414
I'm going to find a new
job and a new house.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.625
 But I like this house.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.877
 Well, we'll find
a better house.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.505
 Mom, we can't just leave.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.048
 Says who?

02:12.173 --> 02:18.471
There is a whole world out
there waiting for us to see it.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.348
You and me.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.349
Come on.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.772
 OK.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.608
 OK, good.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.193
 Shouldn't we lock
the front door?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.495
[music playing]

03:01.181 --> 03:02.515
 Hey, Doreen.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.185
 What a nice surprise.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.855
[sighs] Mm.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.106
 Watch your step there.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.608
 What brings you
all the way out here?

03:11.733 --> 03:15.904
 Oh, just came out to
check on Will's wildies.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.949
It's something that I--

03:20.075 --> 03:22.202
 That's very kind of you.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.829
 Yeah.

03:24.954 --> 03:28.875
So, uh, I see you
sold the place.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.919
 Yeah, our family
wanted to hang on to it,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.546
but we can't afford the upkeep.

03:33.672 --> 03:36.257
 How about the horses?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.760
Winter's coming.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.054
 I know.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.891
 [sobs]

03:45.016 --> 03:46.226
 Doreen?

03:46.351 --> 03:47.852
 I'm sorry, I--
you know we tried

03:47.977 --> 03:50.271
to find a buyer who would
agree to protect the horses,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.190
but we failed.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.650
 What do you mean?

03:53.775 --> 03:55.944
 He's already arranged
for a slaughterhouse.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.404
He lied to us.

04:00.198 --> 04:04.119
 Well, there must be
something that can be done.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.412
 It's too late.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.123
He takes possession
in a few days.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.375
[sighs]

04:19.259 --> 04:22.762
[theme - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

04:33.815 --> 04:41.114
(SINGING) And at the break of
day, you sank into your dreams.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.323
You dreamer.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.619
You dreamer.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.498
Dreamer.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.717
[music playing]

05:00.842 --> 05:02.969
 So the big days this Saturday,
how are you holding up?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.680
 Yeah, I heard this whole
bridezilla thing, but you know,

05:05.805 --> 05:07.140
Maya is just the exact opposite.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.392
She's been so relaxed
for this whole thing.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.478
 It's all the yoga
and meditation.

05:11.603 --> 05:15.815
 Yeah, maybe I just wish
I was as calm as she was.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.193
 I think everybody is kind of
nervous before their wedding.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.194
 Really?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.028
 Yeah, for sure.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.071
I was.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.030
 You were?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.448
 Yeah, who isn't?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.033
 [sighs] I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.826
I am losing my mind here.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.787
I can't help but think that
I jumped into this just a bit

05:28.912 --> 05:30.372
too soon.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.540
I-- I love Maya, I do, but just
promising to spend the rest

05:32.665 --> 05:34.959
of my life with her is--

05:35.085 --> 05:38.713
[sighs] it's huge.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.675
But I guess that's
how you felt, right?

05:41.800 --> 05:42.967
 No.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.845
I was nervous about
messing up my vows.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.472
Spending the rest of
my life with Marion,

05:47.597 --> 05:51.309
I was certain about that.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.687
But my marriage didn't last
very long, so what do I know?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.817
 I'm sure whatever
cold feet Mitch

05:58.942 --> 06:00.777
is having are going to melt
away the moment he sees

06:00.902 --> 06:02.153
Maya walking down the aisle.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.530
 I don't think so.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.240
I think he's having
second thoughts.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.116
 Would you excuse me?

06:06.241 --> 06:07.075
 Oh, Lou!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.076
Lou, wait, wait, wait.

06:08.201 --> 06:08.993
Come on.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.328
 Tim!

06:10.453 --> 06:12.122
Leave her be.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.749
The last thing she needs right
now is false hope about Mitch.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.002
Come on.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.004
 [sighs]

06:25.385 --> 06:27.429
 Oh, thanks for coming.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.848
I wasn't sure if
you got my messages.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.852
 Yeah, I, um, I just
needed some time to think.

06:33.977 --> 06:34.894
 OK.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.939
Yeah, I understand.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.400
Um, so I just--

06:40.525 --> 06:44.946
I wanted to apologize to you
in person for the way I acted.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.913
It wasn't your fault that
I missed my horse show.

06:54.039 --> 06:59.252
So I-- I shouldn't have blamed
you for it and I'm sorry.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.714
 It's OK, I accept
your apology.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.382
 You do?

07:04.507 --> 07:07.052
 Yeah, I do.

07:07.177 --> 07:12.265
Um-- yeah, I just, uh, I--

07:12.390 --> 07:16.311
I do just-- I think
that we should break up.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.312
 What?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.772
 Is the best.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.191
You know, like, you've
got a huge opportunity

07:21.316 --> 07:23.485
in Europe, which is great.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.070
 But I don't know yet.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.071
I still haven't decided.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.572
 I know, but the
fact is that we're

07:27.697 --> 07:29.532
going in different directions.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.284
We graduate in the spring.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.870
And the day after
we're finished,

07:33.995 --> 07:35.872
I'm going to pack up my
car and I'm going to hit

07:35.997 --> 07:38.249
the road to a faraway place.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.585
And if we were together,
then-- then, yeah,

07:40.710 --> 07:43.213
maybe you would want
to come with me.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.425
But then you'd realize that you
can't because you have a show

07:47.550 --> 07:49.636
or you have a--

07:49.761 --> 07:52.347
a clinic or-- or
there's some ribbon

07:52.472 --> 07:53.848
somewhere that you have to win.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.105
You-- you'd go
your way and I'd--

08:00.230 --> 08:02.649
I'd go mine.

08:02.774 --> 08:06.695
So let's just save
ourselves a lot of time

08:06.820 --> 08:09.447
and a lot of heartbreak.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.950
Let's just end it now, OK?

08:12.075 --> 08:15.537
[music playing]

08:16.454 --> 08:17.539
Bye.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.340
TIM: What?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.425
No.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.843
You can't bring him here.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.344
 Well, it would just be
temporary until we could

08:31.469 --> 08:32.345
find them a permanent home.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.556
 Uh, that's a good idea.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.890
 It's not a good idea.

08:36.015 --> 08:36.975
It's a bad idea.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.144
This is a working
cattle ranch, Jack.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.229
Where are we going to put a
whole herd of wild horses?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.688
 I don't know.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.774
We'll figure that out
when the time comes.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.486
Listen, all I know
is that those horses

08:48.611 --> 08:49.946
meant everything to Will.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.408
And I'm not about to
let my friend down.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.285
OK, let's do this.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.538
Everyone in favor of bringing
those wildies home to Heartland

08:58.663 --> 09:01.332
raise your hand.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.876
 Georgie, yup.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.211
How about you, Katie?

09:05.337 --> 09:06.921
Well, there you go.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.256
It's settled.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.175
I'll let Doreen know.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.052
 How are you even
going to get them here?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.220
 Well, you're welcome to use a
Fairfield trailer if you like.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.098
 Oh, no, Lise, you
don't want those horses

09:17.223 --> 09:17.932
in your nice trailer.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.392
They'll kick the crap out of it.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.019
 I don't mind, I really don't.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.272
 It's a nice gesture, thank
you, but I'll call Stumpy.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.482
He's got that junker.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.150
 Stumpy's trailer
holds 10 horses.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.735
Where are you going to
put the rest of them?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.570
 We can make more than
one trip, can't we?

09:30.695 --> 09:32.072
 Before the possession date?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.866
Good luck with that.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.201
 I think it's a good idea.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.037
 Ugh, no.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.622
[sighs]

09:50.507 --> 09:52.967
[truck honking]

09:59.391 --> 10:03.520
 I can't stop
thinking about Luke.

10:03.645 --> 10:08.316
I just wish there was a way we
could make it easier for him.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.319
 [sighs] How, though?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.613
 He likes it here.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.739
He likes us.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.659
Maybe--

10:20.286 --> 10:23.039
 I think I know where
you're going with this, Amy.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.000
 Is it such a crazy idea?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.089
[sighs]

10:31.214 --> 10:32.007
 No, it's not.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.680
I've thought about it too, Amy.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.391
But where's he going to sleep?

10:41.516 --> 10:43.184
We barely have enough
room for our own daughter.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.566
And even if we did
have enough room,

10:49.691 --> 10:51.192
becoming Luke's
foster parents is

10:51.317 --> 10:55.864
a big responsibility, that would
completely change our lives.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.702
Do you feel ready for that?

11:03.455 --> 11:06.207
 No.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.044
You're right.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.046
 [sighs]

11:13.298 --> 11:15.508
Wherever Luke ends
up, I hope he's

11:15.633 --> 11:18.595
close enough to come and visit.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.846
But any more than
that and I just

11:19.971 --> 11:21.389
don't think it's realistic.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.480
[music playing]

11:28.605 --> 11:29.814
JACK: OK.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.524
Stumpy says we can
borrow his trailer.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.068
We'll pick it up on the way.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.569
 Are we really going to
have time to make two trips?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.738
 Not if we don't
leave right now.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.413
[truck honking]

11:49.334 --> 11:51.086
 Dad, where did
you get the truck?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.253
 My stock guy owed me a favor.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.963
 Wow!

11:54.089 --> 11:55.173
 Well, there's more than
enough room for the entire herd

11:55.298 --> 11:56.007
in that thing.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.259
 That's the idea, Ty.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.679
 I thought you were
dead-set against this.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.932
 Yeah, well, I'm not big on it.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.601
But, hey, I got outvoted so--

12:06.726 --> 12:07.769
you want my help or not?

12:27.539 --> 12:28.665
Hey!

12:28.790 --> 12:30.208
 Hey, Mitch.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.960
 I was just heading
to the barber.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.086
I was going to get my haircut.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.170
 All right.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.423
Big day's just
around the corner.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.382
Must be excited.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.800
 I'm a little nervous.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.260
I haven't written my vows yet.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.803
I should have done
it weeks ago, but I'm

12:41.928 --> 12:44.639
just not that great with words.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.434
 It doesn't have to be
anything poetic or flowery.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.686
Just tell the truth.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.812
 The truth.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.984
I should, uh, get going.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.485
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.361
I'll-- I'll see you later.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.320
 OK.

13:03.241 --> 13:03.992
Mitch?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.453
 Yeah?

13:06.578 --> 13:10.582
 Don't get your
hair cut too short.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.292
 What?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.044
 You don't want to look like
your sixth great photo day,

13:14.169 --> 13:16.504
you know, in your
wedding photos.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.298
It's a common mistake.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.258
 Right.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.844
Thanks.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.095
 Oh, god.

[music playing]

13:58.546 --> 14:01.925
 I just keep expecting Will
to come out of the house.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.761
It just feels so different
here without him.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.347
 Yep, I know what you mean.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.851
Well, let's get to work.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.237
 Jack, we got to do
something about Lou.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.280
 Are we really
talking about this?

14:24.406 --> 14:25.907
I think she's just
trying to accept

14:26.032 --> 14:27.200
the reality of the situation.

14:27.325 --> 14:27.992
 No.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.411
She's given up.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.620
 Well, do you blame her?

14:30.745 --> 14:32.497
He's getting married
in a couple days.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.873
 A couple of days.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.834
So she still has time.

14:35.959 --> 14:36.918
 Have you lost your mind.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.004
 Mitch was telling me--

14:39.129 --> 14:41.965
he was telling me about
getting cold feet.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.510
And I started
thinking about Marion

14:45.635 --> 14:47.470
and how I never had
a doubt in my mind

14:47.595 --> 14:49.556
that I wanted to spend the
rest of my life with her--

14:52.726 --> 14:54.019
until I messed it up.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.104
 It's water under
the bridge, Tim.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.522
 For me.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.065
But not for Lou.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.568
 I think you best
leave well enough alone.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.069
Lou's a grown woman.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.238
Don't go interfering
in her life.

 Actually, we
have a better idea.

You know that land
you gifted us?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.433
 Yeah.

 That's your spot.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.313
Are you sure about that?

 Will shared his

24:42.982 --> 24:46.403
you have to tell him right now.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.822
 If I go into that church
and say that in front of Maya,

24:48.947 --> 24:50.365
everyone's going to hate me.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.617
 If you don't tell them,
you're going to hate yourself

24:52.742 --> 24:55.620
for the rest of your life.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.622
GEORGIE: He's right, Mom.

24:57.747 --> 24:58.707
You should go.

24:58.832 --> 24:59.624
 Listen to your daughter.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.752
She's a smart kid.

25:02.877 --> 25:03.878
 I've got the girls.

25:06.965 --> 25:09.300
 OK, OK, OK.

25:09.426 --> 25:11.386
 Hey, I love you.

25:11.511 --> 25:12.554
This is the right thing.

25:16.808 --> 25:19.853
 This is totally insane.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.063
I'm not actually
doing this, am I?

25:24.941 --> 25:26.860
Lou, you are doing this.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.737
And nothing is
going to stop you.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.242
You kidding me?

25:34.367 --> 25:35.201
Hello!

25:35.326 --> 25:36.411
Hi!

25:36.536 --> 25:38.329
Can these guys go any faster?

25:38.455 --> 25:40.165
[sheep bleating]

25:40.290 --> 25:41.374
It's a sign.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.751
It's a sign!

25:42.876 --> 25:44.502
Some-- some higher
power doesn't want

25:44.627 --> 25:45.754
me to break up this wedding.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.799
There's no sign, Lou.

25:49.924 --> 25:53.803
It is just a bunch of sheep.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.264
[hooting] Coming through.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.265
Shoo!

25:57.390 --> 25:58.224
Shoo!

25:58.350 --> 25:59.100
Oh, thank you, sorry.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.477
Sorry.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.978
Excuse me.
So sorry.

26:02.103 --> 26:02.937
Thank you.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.145
[sobs]

26:52.612 --> 26:56.116
[music playing]

27:08.420 --> 27:10.839
MITCH: Lou?

27:10.964 --> 27:11.840
 Mitch.

27:15.135 --> 27:17.303
 What are you doing here?

27:17.429 --> 27:18.638
 I'm still in love with you.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.602
I ran in here to tell you that
in the middle of your wedding,

27:24.728 --> 27:27.188
which is crazy and--

27:27.313 --> 27:29.399
and horrible, but I--

27:29.524 --> 27:34.863
I had to tell you what's in my
heart before you got married.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.406
And I got here too late.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.616
So now I'm telling a
married man that I love him

27:38.742 --> 27:42.829
in a church which is so wrong.

27:42.954 --> 27:43.997
But here I am.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.632
You're not wearing a suit.

27:54.758 --> 27:55.884
Why aren't you wearing a suit?

27:59.929 --> 28:02.223
 Because there
wasn't a wedding.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.224
 What?

28:06.895 --> 28:11.024
 Maya and I broke up and
then we called it off.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.568
 You called off the wedding?

28:13.693 --> 28:15.945
 Yeah.

28:16.071 --> 28:18.031
You know, the minister
had to tell all the guests

28:18.156 --> 28:19.240
as they arrived that it was--

28:25.121 --> 28:29.334
so I just-- I came back to
apologize to him in person.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.251
 I'm sorry.

28:32.796 --> 28:33.880
 Yeah.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.010
I'm going to go do that.

28:52.691 --> 28:55.944
[chattering]

29:00.156 --> 29:01.574
 If you're breaking up
with me because of the way

29:01.700 --> 29:07.080
I acted the night in the
parkade, then I accept that.

29:07.205 --> 29:08.998
But if you're breaking
up with me because you're

29:09.124 --> 29:11.292
afraid we're traveling
in different directions,

29:11.418 --> 29:13.420
then you're a coward.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.632
Truth is, Wyatt,
life takes everyone

29:17.757 --> 29:18.633
in different directions.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.301
It's just the way it is.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.347
But if two people
want to be together,

29:24.472 --> 29:27.642
then they make the
decision to travel

29:27.767 --> 29:29.853
on the same path for a while.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.646
I know what I want.

29:31.771 --> 29:38.111
I want to-- go to gopher museums
and watch old Godzilla movies.

29:38.236 --> 29:44.284
And go on trips to
faraway places with you.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.667
Question is, what do you want?

29:52.792 --> 29:56.671
 I-- I don't know.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.341
 Well, figure it
out and let me know.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.520
[sighs]

30:22.781 --> 30:23.615
 Over here!

30:23.740 --> 30:25.116
Over here!

30:25.241 --> 30:26.034
Ty!

30:26.159 --> 30:27.035
 Luke?

30:35.543 --> 30:36.711
You OK?
- Yeah.

30:36.836 --> 30:37.712
 Yeah.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.713
 Luke, where's your mom.

30:38.838 --> 30:39.881
 She's in the car.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.220
 Is this where
you've been staying?

30:45.345 --> 30:47.305
 Mm-mm.

30:47.430 --> 30:48.223
 Hey!

30:52.060 --> 30:53.978
AMY: There's Clint.

30:54.104 --> 30:57.649
 [gasps] Why did you
guys call him here?

30:57.774 --> 30:58.650
 We had to, Luke.

30:58.775 --> 31:00.235
We were worried about you.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.071
 But now my mom's in trouble.

31:03.196 --> 31:03.822
 Well--

31:03.947 --> 31:05.490
 Luke?

31:05.615 --> 31:06.533
 [sighs]

31:06.658 --> 31:07.909
- It's OK.
- Clint.

31:08.034 --> 31:08.910
 It's good to see you.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.621
 It's going to be OK.

31:11.746 --> 31:13.164
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.374
His mom's in the car.

31:18.795 --> 31:19.879
 Hey.

31:23.091 --> 31:27.429
So I'm going to go
talk to your mom.

31:27.554 --> 31:31.975
I want you to stay here
with Ty and Amy, OK?

31:32.100 --> 31:36.104
Hey, everything's
going to be all right.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.355
Back in a minute.

31:42.902 --> 31:43.945
Hello, Andrea.

31:46.531 --> 31:50.410
 Clint, what are
you doing here?

31:50.535 --> 31:52.078
 Well, your son
called Ty and Amy.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.621
He was concerned about you.

31:56.624 --> 31:59.711
Andrea, how long have you
been staying in the car?

31:59.836 --> 32:00.795
 Not long.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.049
We're on a trip.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.133
 Where are you going?

32:09.054 --> 32:10.096
 I don't know.

32:14.351 --> 32:15.935
 Listen, I'm going to
take you and Luke someplace

32:16.061 --> 32:18.104
safe for the night, OK?

32:18.229 --> 32:19.481
Why don't you get
your things together.

32:21.733 --> 32:22.609
 OK.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.990
[music playing]

32:30.450 --> 32:32.327
 [sighs]

32:35.288 --> 32:37.248
 Mom.

32:37.374 --> 32:38.416
I shouldn't have called them.

32:38.541 --> 32:39.584
I'm sorry.

32:39.709 --> 32:41.920
 It's OK.

32:42.045 --> 32:42.837
You don't have to be sorry.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.632
You did the right thing.

32:45.757 --> 32:49.135
Everything is fine.

32:49.260 --> 32:52.514
You just get your bag and
put it in Clint's car,

32:52.639 --> 32:55.266
and I'll be right there.

32:55.392 --> 32:56.184
 Hey.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.687
It's, uh, Andrea, right?

32:58.812 --> 32:59.688
I'm Ty.

32:59.813 --> 33:01.439
This is my wife, Amy.

33:01.564 --> 33:02.774
We're the couple that's been
spending some time with Luke.

33:02.899 --> 33:03.858
 I know.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.194
He's told me about the horses.

33:06.319 --> 33:07.570
He really loves them.

33:07.696 --> 33:10.198
 He-- he didn't at
first, but now he

33:10.323 --> 33:12.951
even has his own horse boots.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.578
 I just want you
to know something.

33:15.704 --> 33:18.748
You can buy Luke all of
the horses in the world,

33:18.873 --> 33:22.752
but that doesn't change the
fact that I'm his mother.

33:22.877 --> 33:25.922
And I'm trying to do
what's best for him.

33:26.047 --> 33:35.974
And that is why I thought
about putting him in care.

33:36.099 --> 33:39.269
But I can't do it.

33:39.394 --> 33:42.272
I can't lose him.

33:42.397 --> 33:44.941
 Luke talks about
you all the time.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.402
He loves you more than anyone
in the world, trust me.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.156
 I am sorry to
interrupt, but I really

33:51.281 --> 33:52.240
think we should get going.

34:08.047 --> 34:11.092
 He's my son.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.719
 We know that.

34:12.844 --> 34:16.348
[music playing]

34:53.927 --> 34:55.719
 Luke doesn't need a
weekend in the country.

34:59.516 --> 35:01.309
 What?

35:01.434 --> 35:03.103
 That's what we to him.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.730
We're just a vacation that he
goes on every once in a while.

35:09.943 --> 35:12.779
It's not enough.

35:12.904 --> 35:16.408
We can give him more than
a vacation from his life.

35:16.533 --> 35:20.995
We can give him a home for
as long as he needs one.

35:21.121 --> 35:23.623
 I thought we decided that
we are not ready for that.

35:26.960 --> 35:32.841
 [sighs] I know, but it's
not like I felt ready to be

35:32.966 --> 35:35.468
a parent when Lyndy was born.

35:35.593 --> 35:39.973
 Neither did I. I was
excited to be a mom,

35:40.098 --> 35:44.185
but, I guess, I was scared I
wouldn't be any good at it.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.649
 So maybe we're asking
ourselves the wrong question.

35:49.774 --> 35:52.152
We should be asking
ourselves if we have

35:52.277 --> 35:53.695
space in our life for Luke.

35:57.949 --> 35:58.783
 I think I do.

36:03.246 --> 36:04.706
 I think I do, too.

36:10.754 --> 36:14.215
[music playing]

36:17.177 --> 36:20.472
 How about a nice cup of tea.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.807
 Oh, yeah, that sounds lovely.

36:22.932 --> 36:24.893
Thank you.

36:25.018 --> 36:26.102
 I'd love one while you're up.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.313
 Yeah, you can
get that yourself.

36:28.438 --> 36:29.898
LISA: [chuckles] Jack!

36:30.023 --> 36:31.024
Be nice.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.234
 Yeah, be nice, Jack.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.612
 I'm being nice.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.489
 Remember what we
talked about earlier?

36:37.614 --> 36:39.699
 Yeah, I think it
might change my mind.

36:39.824 --> 36:43.578
 [chuckles]

36:43.703 --> 36:46.331
 All right, Tim.

36:46.456 --> 36:49.959
Lisa and I think that--

36:50.085 --> 36:52.504
well, since you spent so
much time in the house

36:52.629 --> 36:56.925
already you might as
well move back in.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.260
 Wow.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.054
Thank you.

37:01.179 --> 37:03.014
Both of you.

37:03.139 --> 37:04.391
Uh, Jack, you know I--

37:04.516 --> 37:05.350
it'll only be--

37:05.475 --> 37:07.644
 Temporary, yeah, I know.

37:07.769 --> 37:09.771
I've heard that one before.

37:09.896 --> 37:10.939
 Hey, Jack, wait.

37:16.111 --> 37:17.904
 Two sugars.

37:18.029 --> 37:21.199
 [chuckles] I am going
to put something in that

37:21.324 --> 37:22.951
tea and it won't be sugar.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.252
ANDREA: I get why you're mad.

37:32.377 --> 37:36.464
And I know that it's
hard to understand.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.633
But it's for the best.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.135
 I don't want you to be alone.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.553
Who's going to take care of you?

37:41.678 --> 37:45.306
 Lots of people are
going to take care of me.

37:45.432 --> 37:48.226
Clint knows a place
where I can get help.

37:48.351 --> 37:51.521
So you don't need
to worry about that.

37:51.646 --> 37:56.818
And it's time that
someone looked after you.

37:56.943 --> 38:00.238
People like Amy and Ty.

38:00.363 --> 38:07.787
And when I am feeling better,
you can come and visit me.

38:07.912 --> 38:14.377
And you can tell me about
school and the horses.

38:14.502 --> 38:15.503
Will you do that?

38:19.257 --> 38:21.009
 OK.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.302
 OK, good.

38:30.268 --> 38:41.446
During my darkest and rainiest
days, you are my sunshine.

38:46.493 --> 38:54.000
And I love you very, very much.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.001
OK?

38:59.964 --> 39:00.882
OK.

39:08.264 --> 39:10.433
You take care of him?

39:10.558 --> 39:11.559
 We will.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.487
 [sighs]

39:37.419 --> 39:38.586
 I didn't think
you're going to show.

39:41.339 --> 39:43.925
Look, Mitch, I asked you to come
here because I need to know.

39:46.553 --> 39:47.595
Why did you call
off the wedding?

39:52.350 --> 39:57.105
 You know, I thought--

39:57.230 --> 40:01.109
I hoped that it was cold feet.

40:01.234 --> 40:02.694
When I sat down to
write those vows,

40:02.819 --> 40:05.572
I realized that it
was something else.

40:05.697 --> 40:09.701
Something-- I
couldn't lie to Maya.

40:09.826 --> 40:10.869
She doesn't deserve that.

40:14.372 --> 40:19.961
Lou, what you said
in the church.

40:20.086 --> 40:21.796
Why didn't you say
that six months ago?

40:21.921 --> 40:23.214
 I know.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.924
I wish I had, believe me.

40:25.050 --> 40:27.927
 Yeah, me too.

40:28.053 --> 40:31.890
Because I ruined what
was supposed to be

40:32.015 --> 40:33.725
the best day of Maya's life.

40:33.850 --> 40:36.269
And I-- I don't know how I'm
going to live with myself.

40:36.394 --> 40:38.772
I just-- I have to go
away for a little while.

40:38.897 --> 40:40.065
I got to figure my life out.

40:40.190 --> 40:43.610
I just-- I can't do this.

40:43.735 --> 40:44.986
We can talk about
this another time.

40:45.111 --> 40:46.112
 OK, Mitch, just wait.

40:46.237 --> 40:48.323
Look, I'm sorry how
this all turned out.

40:48.448 --> 40:50.325
And I'm sorry I didn't say
something six months ago,

40:50.450 --> 40:52.202
I should have.

40:52.327 --> 40:56.623
But I am not going to
wait for another time.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.541
Don't you think we both
waited long enough?

 US"]

41:00.043 --> 41:04.089
(SINGING) We were laughing
so we wouldn't cry.

41:07.926 --> 41:12.597
A thousand memories
dancing in your eyes.

41:16.643 --> 41:20.480
Standing here on
the edge of goodbye

41:20.605 --> 41:24.484
with all these unwritten lines.

41:24.609 --> 41:28.279
Hey, here we go again.

41:28.405 --> 41:30.115
 Good boy, Phoenix.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.908
Whoa.

41:32.033 --> 41:36.371
(SINGING) This
story doesn't end.

41:36.496 --> 41:38.456
TY: OK.

41:38.581 --> 41:44.337
(SINGING) It just
changes one, more--

41:44.462 --> 41:46.297
 What are we doing here?

41:46.423 --> 41:49.300
 You're not going to want
to miss this, trust me.

41:49.426 --> 41:51.011
 Here.

41:51.136 --> 41:52.345
 Miss what?

41:52.470 --> 41:53.513
 Just wait.

41:56.558 --> 41:58.059
You'll see.

41:58.184 --> 42:02.063
(SINGING) All the good times
and the hard times too.

42:05.942 --> 42:09.863
There's a whole lot
of road up ahead.

42:09.988 --> 42:13.575
And whatever comes next.

42:13.700 --> 42:21.708
Hey, here we go
again turning pages.

42:21.833 --> 42:28.173
This story doesn't end.

42:28.298 --> 42:29.382
It just changes.

42:29.507 --> 42:30.258
 You're a good boy.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.188
Hey.

42:43.313 --> 42:45.857
Good.

42:45.982 --> 42:46.858
Yeah.

42:54.824 --> 42:59.120

43:18.264 --> 43:24.354
This story doesn't end.

43:24.479 --> 43:34.155
It just changes one more
chapter in a book of us.

43:41.871 --> 43:45.959
Story doesn't end.

43:46.084 --> 43:56.094
It just changes one more
chapter in the book of us.

43:56.219 --> 44:04.686
One more chapter
in the book of us.
