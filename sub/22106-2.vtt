00:25.195 --> 00:30.468
You think there are
any survivors?

00:31.068 --> 00:34.370
Ezra.

00:34.371 --> 00:37.673
Ezra.

00:37.674 --> 00:38.674
Ezra.

00:40.644 --> 00:42.879
They're graves, Feena.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.382
This isn't a settlement;
This is a cemetery.

00:46.383 --> 00:48.986
See for yourself.

00:58.328 --> 01:00.263
Red Drone said we'd
find people here.

01:00.264 --> 01:02.599
We just did.

01:03.133 --> 01:03.867
So that's it?

01:03.868 --> 01:05.367
We come all this way
for nothing?

01:05.369 --> 01:06.369
No one's going to help us?

01:06.370 --> 01:08.171
Let's calm down and
think about this.

01:08.172 --> 01:08.872
Calm?

01:08.873 --> 01:09.939
They're dead, Abram.

01:09.940 --> 01:10.774
There's no settlement.

01:10.775 --> 01:14.343
Are you not getting this?

01:14.344 --> 01:15.611
What are we going to do?

01:15.612 --> 01:17.614
We've got no fresh
water or food.

01:20.517 --> 01:21.517
Hey!

01:22.352 --> 01:23.352
Hey!

01:38.869 --> 01:40.137
Ezra.

01:41.305 --> 01:42.972
Those people didn't
bury themselves.

01:42.973 --> 01:46.042
Yeah, but whoever did bury
them isn't here now.

01:46.043 --> 01:47.543
Look at this place.

01:47.544 --> 01:49.179
No one's been here for ages.

01:51.315 --> 01:53.317
One way to find out.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.320
Where are you going?

01:57.321 --> 02:01.191
To see who's behind this door.

02:13.770 --> 02:15.371
The whole city?

02:15.372 --> 02:16.839
Most of it.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.641
Then you shouldn't go.

02:17.642 --> 02:19.775
It isn't safe.

02:19.776 --> 02:21.644
My parents should've
been back by now, Lynn.

02:21.645 --> 02:23.446
They have friends at the
bottom of the mountain.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.181
Maybe they know where they went.

02:25.182 --> 02:26.682
You don't know what's out there.

02:26.683 --> 02:28.952
Which is why I have to go.

02:32.389 --> 02:34.490
It may not be safe
for us to stay here.

02:34.491 --> 02:36.125
I need to know that.

02:36.126 --> 02:37.360
How am I going to reach you?

02:37.361 --> 02:38.628
There's no satellite
or cell service.

02:38.629 --> 02:41.130
I'll be back by
tomorrow evening.

02:41.131 --> 02:42.498
I just want us to stay together.

02:42.499 --> 02:43.866
Hey.

02:43.867 --> 02:46.135
We will always be together.

02:46.136 --> 02:48.038
Nothing's going to change that.

03:06.690 --> 03:09.326
It's no use, Ezra.

03:14.097 --> 03:15.666
They're not here.

03:21.171 --> 03:23.773
What happened to those people
buried out there?

03:23.774 --> 03:25.675
You won't like the answer.

03:25.676 --> 03:26.709
Why not?

03:26.710 --> 03:28.779
Because it will
likely kill you too.

03:34.117 --> 03:34.618
Come.

03:34.619 --> 03:36.353
I will show you.

04:23.767 --> 04:25.835
What is this place?

04:25.836 --> 04:29.305
Before the invasion,
it was a military facility.

04:29.306 --> 04:33.509
Protected from wind and rain,
it has endured for centuries.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.344
Hasn't endured them well.

04:35.345 --> 04:37.680
Smells like dirty laundry.

04:37.681 --> 04:40.282
There is far less mildew
than there should be.

04:40.283 --> 04:43.285
The previous settlers must
have cleaned it thoroughly.

04:43.286 --> 04:45.354
This is after cleaning.

04:45.355 --> 04:46.356
Lovely.

05:54.191 --> 05:56.892
Hello, Duncan.

05:56.893 --> 06:01.731
My companion calls,
but yours doesn't answer.

06:01.732 --> 06:03.300
Why is that?

06:06.470 --> 06:07.471
It sleeps.

06:13.310 --> 06:16.245
It would've awakened by now.

06:16.246 --> 06:17.981
It must be weak with sickness.

06:21.084 --> 06:24.253
You have nothing to fear,
brother.

06:24.254 --> 06:26.156
We will make you whole again.

06:51.047 --> 06:54.016
I believe this is where
the settlers died.

06:54.017 --> 06:55.184
You're not sure?

06:55.185 --> 06:58.454
The settlement was already
deserted when I arrived.

06:58.455 --> 07:00.122
When was that?

07:00.123 --> 07:01.590
A year ago.

07:01.591 --> 07:02.992
You've been alone all that time?

07:02.993 --> 07:06.162
You are the first
humans I've seen.

07:06.163 --> 07:09.165
What about the desert people
who chased us in here?

07:09.166 --> 07:10.900
You must have seen them before.

07:10.901 --> 07:13.335
The Skin Riders are not human.

07:13.336 --> 07:15.571
Not anymore.

07:15.572 --> 07:17.439
Is that what killed
the settlers?

07:17.440 --> 07:19.308
Skin Riders?

07:19.309 --> 07:20.576
No.

07:20.577 --> 07:23.346
It was another,
more subtle enemy.

07:29.820 --> 07:32.354
"Quarantine."

07:32.355 --> 07:33.489
Were they sick?

07:33.490 --> 07:34.824
Yes.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.759
My sensors detect
traces of a virus

07:36.760 --> 07:39.161
heretofore unknown to humans.

07:39.162 --> 07:41.497
So a new virus killed them.

07:41.498 --> 07:43.432
One that didn't
exist in our time.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.367
Correct.

07:45.368 --> 07:46.702
But at the lake,

07:46.703 --> 07:48.370
the red drone said that
our DNA had been altered.

07:48.371 --> 07:50.506
Whatever killed the settlers
can't kill us.

07:50.507 --> 07:52.274
It's not that simple.

07:52.275 --> 07:54.877
If the Sparks and the drone
who reconstituted you

07:54.878 --> 07:56.712
didn't know that these
settlers had died-

07:56.713 --> 07:58.614
Then they may not have
known about this disease.

07:58.615 --> 07:59.982
Quite possibly.

07:59.983 --> 08:01.984
So, we're not immunized.

08:01.985 --> 08:02.552
No.

08:02.553 --> 08:04.553
You are likely infected.

08:04.554 --> 08:06.121
Well, nice talk,

08:06.122 --> 08:08.224
but I think we'll skip the gift
shop and just get out of here.

08:08.225 --> 08:11.160
It's not wise to leave the
protection of the barrier.

08:11.161 --> 08:14.330
It's not wise to walk around
in an infected environment.

08:14.331 --> 08:15.364
You misunderstand.

08:15.365 --> 08:18.300
The disease is not localized
to this facility.

08:18.301 --> 08:19.401
It's everywhere,

08:19.402 --> 08:21.637
inside and outside the barrier.

08:21.638 --> 08:23.305
You can't run from it.

08:23.306 --> 08:26.075
You must immunize yourselves
against it.

08:26.076 --> 08:27.477
How?

08:33.450 --> 08:35.150
This is the control room.

08:35.150 --> 08:39.087
Most of the equipment failed
centuries ago.

08:39.089 --> 08:41.191
What a dump.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.294
How does this place
still have power?

08:45.295 --> 08:47.963
Solar panes hidden elsewhere,

08:47.964 --> 08:52.268
plus a warehouse of supplies
untouched since the extinction.

08:52.269 --> 08:55.805
The settlers worked hard
to restore what they could.

09:01.978 --> 09:04.748
This tank is
designed to hold Sparks.

09:09.953 --> 09:12.254
The Sparks.

09:12.255 --> 09:14.223
They can immunize us.

09:14.224 --> 09:15.224
Possibly.

09:15.225 --> 09:17.960
I'll need to consult
with them first.

09:17.961 --> 09:19.729
You can communicate
with the Sparks?

09:20.130 --> 09:22.131
It's one of my
primary functions.

09:22.132 --> 09:24.467
Kindly pour them into the tank.

09:47.524 --> 09:49.458
I'm coming with you.

09:49.459 --> 09:50.459
Not happening.

09:50.460 --> 09:51.194
I'm a nurse.

09:51.195 --> 09:53.495
People might be injured.

09:53.496 --> 09:55.764
Do we leave Kylie with Silas?

09:55.765 --> 09:57.099
Is that so awful?

09:57.100 --> 09:58.701
My brother can barely
take care of himself,

09:58.702 --> 10:00.302
much less our daughter.

10:00.303 --> 10:01.583
You don't give him
enough credit.

10:03.006 --> 10:04.374
You don't know him
as well as I do.

10:05.775 --> 10:07.343
Then take him with you.

10:07.344 --> 10:09.345
I'll feel better
if you're not alone.

10:09.346 --> 10:13.282
Same.

10:13.283 --> 10:14.350
All right.

10:14.351 --> 10:16.218
He stays.

10:16.219 --> 10:18.454
But be nice to him.

10:18.455 --> 10:21.191
He needs a brother, not a judge.

10:22.025 --> 10:25.195
Well, he got both.

10:27.397 --> 10:30.332
You listen to Mommy, okay?

10:30.333 --> 10:32.035
Love you.

10:47.650 --> 10:50.319
I should go with you.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.687
Silas, I-

10:51.688 --> 10:53.889
I have as much right to look
for Mom and Dad as you do.

10:53.890 --> 10:54.557
It's not safe.

10:54.557 --> 10:55.492
I can handle myself.

10:55.493 --> 10:59.195
No, you can't.

11:01.097 --> 11:05.501
Look, I'm not bringing my
brother into a war zone, okay?

11:05.502 --> 11:07.836
Yeah.

11:07.837 --> 11:09.506
I wouldn't want
to slow you down.

11:37.534 --> 11:40.202
I'll post someone here.

11:40.203 --> 11:41.303
If anyone leaves the settlement,

11:41.304 --> 11:42.304
we'll know.

11:44.808 --> 11:47.076
You said you injected
one of them?

11:47.077 --> 11:50.212
The one called Abram.

11:50.213 --> 11:54.349
Then why isn't he blessed
with a companion?

11:54.350 --> 11:56.418
They must have
annihilated the spore.

11:56.419 --> 11:57.654
An inborn immunity?

12:00.323 --> 12:02.092
Or they used the Sparks.

12:06.329 --> 12:08.832
I know I can count on you
to protect us, Jax.

12:13.269 --> 12:15.271
Does it bother you?

12:17.006 --> 12:18.641
That one of them
is your brother?

12:20.510 --> 12:23.679
You are my brother, Jax.

12:23.680 --> 12:29.218
That is a halforganism
trapped in ignorance.

12:29.219 --> 12:35.725
If the Ancestor blesses us,
we will show him the light.

12:45.702 --> 12:49.071
The Sparks believe they can
make a therapeutic vaccine

12:49.072 --> 12:50.973
that will act as both a cure for

12:50.974 --> 12:53.142
and a protection
against the virus.

12:53.143 --> 12:55.377
So, they can immunize us?

12:55.378 --> 12:57.814
They can't help you
until you help them.

12:58.948 --> 13:01.150
So we're bargaining
for our life now?

13:01.151 --> 13:02.351
Hear it out.

13:02.352 --> 13:03.485
Why?

13:03.486 --> 13:05.787
We don't even know
if we are infected.

13:05.788 --> 13:07.823
Could be making
this whole thing up.

13:07.824 --> 13:10.659
Wouldn't be the first drone
to lie to us.

13:10.660 --> 13:12.327
She has a point.

13:12.328 --> 13:16.765
How do we know it's really
speaking with the Sparks?

13:16.766 --> 13:18.767
Tell the Sparks to move to
the bottom righthand corner

13:18.768 --> 13:19.768
of this tank.

13:19.769 --> 13:21.303
You are testing me.

13:21.304 --> 13:24.140
I'm giving you a chance
to prove yourself.

13:46.329 --> 13:49.131
They wanted me to tell you
that they don't roll over

13:49.132 --> 13:52.534
and they don't play dead.

13:52.535 --> 13:54.337
You got our attention.

14:00.577 --> 14:02.578
The Sparks can't
heal you now because

14:02.579 --> 14:05.681
they don't have the ingredients
to create the vaccine.

14:05.682 --> 14:07.082
What ingredients?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.484
Amino acids,
proteins, dead bacteria;

14:09.485 --> 14:12.254
All variety of organics
plentiful in a lake

14:12.255 --> 14:15.157
where there's a
living ecosystem.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.159
Not so plentiful here.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.628
That tank is filtered rainwater.

14:19.629 --> 14:21.663
So we have to carry
the Sparks to a lake?

14:21.664 --> 14:22.831
Some of them, yes.

14:22.832 --> 14:24.366
We just came from a lake.

14:24.367 --> 14:26.134
I can guide you to another one

14:26.135 --> 14:27.869
only a few kilometers away.

14:27.870 --> 14:30.206
Not where Skin Riders are?

14:35.511 --> 14:36.812
What?

14:36.813 --> 14:38.348
Your nose is bleeding.

14:40.683 --> 14:45.187
I suggest we hurry.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.388
You're infected.

14:46.389 --> 14:47.389
You should stay and rest.

14:47.390 --> 14:48.191
I'll go with Ezra.

14:48.192 --> 14:49.358
Yellow and I can handle this.

14:49.359 --> 14:50.892
And if something happens
and you're delayed,

14:50.893 --> 14:53.128
then Feena's without a vaccine.

14:53.129 --> 14:55.364
We improve our odds
if we both go.

14:55.365 --> 14:56.266
Plus, if Abram stays,

14:56.267 --> 14:58.100
he'll have to wait longer
for the vaccine,

14:58.101 --> 15:01.336
during which time,
he might become sick.

15:01.337 --> 15:04.172
If he goes,
you both get it immediately.

15:04.173 --> 15:06.308
She's got you there.

15:06.309 --> 15:07.309
All right.

15:08.177 --> 15:09.578
Anything else we need to know?

15:09.579 --> 15:11.980
Once we reach the water,
it will take several hours

15:11.981 --> 15:14.149
for the Sparks to gather
the needed organics

15:14.150 --> 15:16.018
to create a vaccine.

15:16.019 --> 15:18.253
So we'll need to
be on our guard.

15:18.254 --> 15:19.488
You going to be okay
by yourself?

15:19.489 --> 15:21.423
Do I look like I want company?

15:21.424 --> 15:22.691
Right.

15:22.692 --> 15:24.360
Let's go.

15:38.441 --> 15:39.175
Now what?

15:39.176 --> 15:40.942
"Open Sesame"?

15:40.943 --> 15:41.778
You doin' this?

15:41.779 --> 15:43.545
No.

15:43.546 --> 15:44.347
Then who is?

15:44.348 --> 15:46.516
I am programmed not to answer.

15:47.517 --> 15:49.285
As long as they let us back in.

16:31.127 --> 16:31.928
They're moving north!

16:31.928 --> 16:32.762
I'll take three brothers.

16:32.763 --> 16:34.429
We'll seize the Sparks.

16:34.430 --> 16:39.101
Like you did last time?

16:39.102 --> 16:41.136
Duncan will lead the effort.

16:41.137 --> 16:44.606
What better way to
reaffirm his loyalty?

16:44.607 --> 16:46.808
Duncan is not well.

16:46.809 --> 16:49.111
Well enough to walk.

16:49.112 --> 16:52.347
Wise enough to stay close.

16:52.348 --> 16:55.650
The protection of the
community is my duty.

16:55.651 --> 16:59.054
And the faith of the
community is mine.

16:59.055 --> 17:01.290
Duncan will not disappoint.

18:03.719 --> 18:04.953
Hello?

18:04.954 --> 18:06.122
Anybody home?

18:23.973 --> 18:25.141
Well, well.

18:31.981 --> 18:34.149
I think we deserve to have
a few questions answered.

18:34.150 --> 18:36.818
That's the quest
of every human, is it not?

18:36.819 --> 18:40.155
To explain, to understand,
"Who am I?

18:40.156 --> 18:42.290
Why am I here?"

18:42.291 --> 18:43.992
Let's start with
"Why am I here?"

18:43.993 --> 18:46.528
You are here because
the Sparks restored you to life

18:46.529 --> 18:48.763
four centuries after your death.

18:48.764 --> 18:50.265
Why?

18:50.266 --> 18:52.467
To begin the
deextinction of the human race.

18:52.468 --> 18:53.969
But why us?

18:53.970 --> 18:55.537
Red Drone wouldn't answer
that question.

18:55.538 --> 18:57.706
Would you rather
we restore someone else?

18:57.707 --> 18:59.207
I would rather know the truth.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.109
The truth is
humans were extinct,

19:01.110 --> 19:03.211
and now they are not.

19:03.212 --> 19:04.212
Okay.

19:04.213 --> 19:05.780
Let's try a different approach.

19:05.781 --> 19:07.115
Who do you work for?

19:07.116 --> 19:08.149
The Sparks.

19:08.150 --> 19:09.484
Who do they work for?

19:09.485 --> 19:11.152
They haven't told me.

19:11.153 --> 19:12.888
So they work for somebody?

19:12.889 --> 19:14.456
Everybody works for somebody.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.124
Are you always this evasive?

19:16.125 --> 19:19.128
I must now gain altitude
to scan for threats.

19:22.265 --> 19:27.069
I'll take that as a yes.

19:44.921 --> 19:45.988
Show me your eyes.

19:53.429 --> 19:56.097
Do you know why I hate humans?

19:56.098 --> 20:04.098
Why I find them so repugnant,
including this one?

20:04.106 --> 20:09.110
Because they have something
they don't deserve.

20:09.111 --> 20:12.380
This organism,
so beautifully designed,

20:12.381 --> 20:17.786
so resilient, so strong.

20:17.787 --> 20:22.357
Legs that can stand, leap, run-

20:22.358 --> 20:27.562
Hands that can
grasp and squeeze.

20:27.563 --> 20:32.734
And what does a human
do with this gift?

20:32.735 --> 20:37.973
He strikes, he steals,
he profanes...

20:37.974 --> 20:41.343
and he kills.

20:41.344 --> 20:45.146
He destroys his own kind...

20:45.147 --> 20:47.315
his own brothers.

20:47.316 --> 20:55.316
Is that an organism that
deserves all of this...

20:56.258 --> 20:59.494
when our companion
has so little?

20:59.495 --> 21:03.965
He can't stand or grasp,
yet he makes better use

21:03.966 --> 21:06.135
of these bodies than
humans ever did.

21:11.007 --> 21:14.175
A companion that doesn't
hold his human tightly-

21:14.176 --> 21:18.179
That lets his human choose-

21:18.180 --> 21:22.685
He doesn't deserve
to have a human.

21:25.488 --> 21:28.657
Shall we move on?

21:28.658 --> 21:29.659
Yes.

21:30.793 --> 21:32.228
I think Duncan is ready.

21:48.411 --> 21:52.013
So, you exmilitary?

21:52.014 --> 21:53.481
Why do you ask?

21:53.482 --> 21:55.517
The way you carry yourself.

21:55.518 --> 21:58.119
How you held your own
against those Skin Riders.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.154
I didn't hold my own.

21:59.155 --> 22:01.256
That drone saved my neck.

22:01.257 --> 22:02.758
So you're not exmilitary.

22:04.994 --> 22:06.194
Rangers.

22:06.195 --> 22:07.996
That was before I had a family.

22:07.997 --> 22:08.831
Long time ago.

22:08.832 --> 22:10.266
Everything was a long time ago.

22:10.933 --> 22:12.767
True.

22:12.768 --> 22:14.669
Maybe that's why
the Sparks chose you,

22:14.670 --> 22:17.338
or whoever it was that chose us.

22:17.339 --> 22:19.174
Maybe they needed a soldier.

22:19.175 --> 22:20.208
If they wanted a soldier,

22:20.209 --> 22:21.889
there are plenty of
better options than me.

22:23.112 --> 22:24.546
Maybe.

22:24.547 --> 22:27.182
Or maybe soldiering skills
weren't the only characteristics

22:27.183 --> 22:28.350
they were looking for.

22:37.026 --> 22:39.360
Abram.

22:39.361 --> 22:41.863
Feena.

22:41.864 --> 22:43.798
Ezra.

22:43.799 --> 22:47.302
I think you've got
a screw loose, pal.

22:47.303 --> 22:49.637
Silas.

22:49.638 --> 22:52.341
What did you say?

22:53.542 --> 22:55.745
Come on, talk.

23:01.617 --> 23:03.418
Defense mechanism?

23:03.419 --> 23:05.153
Smart.

23:05.154 --> 23:08.090
Well, let's see what you do
when I ground the current.

23:22.171 --> 23:25.940
Migraine, Red.

23:25.941 --> 23:28.176
You ever had a migraine?

23:28.177 --> 23:29.779
Like a jackhammer in your head?

23:33.115 --> 23:36.285
Don't suppose you have any
Ibuprofen tucked up inside you.

23:58.741 --> 24:01.109
Ooh.

24:01.110 --> 24:05.480
Lightheaded, Red.

24:05.481 --> 24:08.583
Not feeling so good.

24:08.584 --> 24:10.185
What are the symptoms
of this disease,

24:10.186 --> 24:12.153
do you think?

24:12.154 --> 24:19.862
Migraines, bloody nose,
talking to yourself.

24:37.813 --> 24:41.216
I'm just going to close my eyes,
drone.

24:41.217 --> 24:43.518
Just for a few minutes.

24:43.519 --> 24:46.388
Don't go anywhere without me.

25:27.029 --> 25:28.830
So what about you?

25:28.831 --> 25:31.266
Exmilitary too?

25:31.267 --> 25:32.700
Hardly.

25:32.701 --> 25:35.003
Worked with a lot of
activeduty soldiers though,

25:35.004 --> 25:36.437
before the invasion.

25:36.438 --> 25:39.274
Doing what?

25:39.275 --> 25:41.776
Mostly cases of PTSD.

25:41.777 --> 25:43.444
You were a therapist?

25:43.445 --> 25:44.946
Surprised?

25:44.947 --> 25:46.781
A little.

25:46.782 --> 25:48.283
If you're going to restart
the human race,

25:48.284 --> 25:49.852
why bring back a shrink, right?

25:50.286 --> 25:52.321
Maybe to stop us all
from going crazy.

25:53.055 --> 25:55.056
We all believe we were
brought back from the dead

25:55.057 --> 25:58.059
by a swarm of aquatic fireflies.

25:58.060 --> 26:01.462
No therapy session with me
could cure that kind of crazy.

26:01.463 --> 26:03.965
Well, if I'm not crazy,
then what am I?

26:03.966 --> 26:06.267
You're asking for a
professional assessment?

26:06.268 --> 26:07.802
How much will it cost me?

26:07.803 --> 26:10.638
First one's always free.

26:10.639 --> 26:14.809
All right.

26:14.810 --> 26:19.347
You're sleepdeprived,
anxious, stressed.

26:19.348 --> 26:22.650
You endured the invasion,
so you probably have PTSD,

26:22.651 --> 26:24.953
whether you realize it or not.

26:24.954 --> 26:27.355
You just endured another
harrowing event,

26:27.356 --> 26:31.159
so your body released all sorts
of neurochemicals and hormones-

26:31.160 --> 26:34.095
dopamine, epinephrine,
adrenaline.

26:34.096 --> 26:37.365
Chemically,
you're all out of whack.

26:37.366 --> 26:41.269
Good news is these levels
will normalize.

26:41.270 --> 26:45.807
And the bad news?

26:45.808 --> 26:49.510
You're a man who loves his wife.

26:49.511 --> 26:53.181
Loves his child.

26:53.182 --> 26:57.285
And now you realize
you can't have either.

26:57.286 --> 27:01.089
You're in a world
where they don't exist.

27:01.090 --> 27:04.726
I don't have the cure for that.

27:04.727 --> 27:08.130
Nobody does.

27:08.998 --> 27:09.631
Come.

27:09.632 --> 27:11.467
We are nearly there.

27:24.580 --> 27:25.980
Now what?

27:25.981 --> 27:28.850
You release them into the water
and let them get to work.

27:28.851 --> 27:30.952
But how do they know what to do?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.287
They're Sparks.

27:51.173 --> 27:53.641
Now we wait.

27:53.642 --> 27:55.376
How much time does Feena have?

27:55.377 --> 27:57.045
Considering the virulence
of the virus

27:57.046 --> 27:59.614
and how quickly Feena
manifested symptoms,

27:59.615 --> 28:02.951
I'd say her time is short.

28:13.128 --> 28:14.063
Don't be afraid.

28:14.063 --> 28:15.063
I'm here to help.

28:19.068 --> 28:20.134
Where did you come from?

28:20.135 --> 28:23.337
I was told someone here
was sick.

28:23.338 --> 28:24.972
You're one of the settlers?

28:24.973 --> 28:27.241
A survivor?

28:27.242 --> 28:30.144
I don't know what you
mean by "settler."

28:30.145 --> 28:31.913
Who are you?

28:31.914 --> 28:33.614
A friend.

28:33.615 --> 28:37.018
I don't need a friend.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.319
A nurse, then?

28:38.320 --> 28:39.854
Aren't you sick?

28:39.855 --> 28:41.956
A virus.

28:41.957 --> 28:45.093
Same one that killed
the settlers.

28:45.094 --> 28:47.962
There's a discharge
from your ear.

28:47.963 --> 28:50.998
If I had an otoscope,
I'd check it.

28:50.999 --> 28:53.367
What's your name?

28:53.368 --> 28:55.536
Feena.

28:55.537 --> 28:59.107
Do you have any swelling or
discomfort in your ear, Feena?

28:59.108 --> 28:59.741
It's bleeding.

28:59.742 --> 29:02.310
What do you think?

29:02.311 --> 29:04.212
Do you feel disoriented?

29:04.213 --> 29:08.916
Can you follow my finger?

29:08.917 --> 29:10.218
Good.

29:10.219 --> 29:13.889
Why don't you tell me your other
symptoms and I'll do my best...

29:36.411 --> 29:40.081
The drone's scanning from above.

29:40.082 --> 29:42.984
If it sees anyone,
it'll tell us.

29:42.985 --> 29:48.756
If it sees Skin Riders,
you mean.

29:48.757 --> 29:51.325
The drone said they
weren't human anymore.

29:51.326 --> 29:53.095
What do you make of that?

29:57.933 --> 29:59.300
Seemed human to me.

29:59.301 --> 30:01.303
Except for the lump
on the back of the neck.

30:02.471 --> 30:04.605
You ever seen anything
like that before?

30:04.606 --> 30:07.108
Looked like a swollen gland,

30:07.109 --> 30:11.279
only there aren't
any glands there.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.815
Glands don't have
any light either.

30:14.816 --> 30:17.218
So what was it then?

30:17.219 --> 30:19.020
You tell me.

30:19.021 --> 30:21.056
When they injected you,
did you sense anything?

30:22.624 --> 30:26.327
Pain for hours.

30:26.328 --> 30:28.396
And then it was like
a switch had flipped.

30:28.397 --> 30:30.364
I didn't feel anything.

30:30.365 --> 30:34.535
Next thing I know,
I wake up and you've healed me.

30:34.536 --> 30:36.038
Sparks healed you.

30:39.341 --> 30:43.144
What I want to know is where
these Skin Riders come from.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.346
Have humans evolved?

30:45.347 --> 30:49.650
Maybe we never went extinct,
we just changed.

30:49.651 --> 30:52.019
They're not evolved humans.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.487
They're Reborns, like us.

30:53.488 --> 30:55.723
People brought back
from the dead.

30:55.724 --> 30:58.259
How can you be sure?

30:58.260 --> 30:59.962
Because one of them's
my brother.

31:02.197 --> 31:03.331
Say again?

31:03.332 --> 31:04.599
Before I reached the settlement,

31:04.600 --> 31:06.000
when we got separated,

31:06.001 --> 31:08.269
one of the Skin Riders that
attacked me was my brother,

31:08.270 --> 31:09.670
Silas.

31:09.671 --> 31:10.938
You sure?

31:10.939 --> 31:14.275
I'm sure.

31:14.276 --> 31:16.277
What'd he say?

31:16.278 --> 31:18.779
Nothing.

31:18.780 --> 31:20.648
He looked straight at me,

31:20.649 --> 31:25.319
but it was like someone else
was behind his eyes.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.989
Someone I never met before.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.295
Then maybe it wasn't
your brother.

31:34.296 --> 31:38.199
Who's to say what's possible
and what isn't now?

31:38.200 --> 31:41.202
Maybe these Skin Riders
can make people too,

31:41.203 --> 31:43.871
only with a different
brain state.

31:43.872 --> 31:45.873
I don't want to believe that.

31:45.874 --> 31:47.208
Why not?

31:47.209 --> 31:49.378
Because I want my brother
in this world.

32:43.298 --> 32:44.398
Hey, whoa!

32:44.399 --> 32:45.534
Easy.

32:47.669 --> 32:50.404
I told you to watch over
Lynn and Kylie.

32:50.405 --> 32:52.506
Lynn sent me to watch over you.

32:52.507 --> 32:55.009
You got an issue,
take it up with her.

32:55.010 --> 32:57.445
And how are you supposed
to help me, exactly?

32:57.446 --> 32:58.979
Give me the gun.

32:58.980 --> 33:00.915
I'll go look for Mom and Dad.

33:00.916 --> 33:01.916
I'm expendable.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.250
The weapon isn't.

33:03.251 --> 33:04.985
You don't know how
to use it anyway.

33:04.986 --> 33:06.787
Let me guess.

33:06.788 --> 33:08.322
Point that end at the bad guys

33:08.323 --> 33:10.324
and pull back on
the trigger thingy.

33:10.325 --> 33:11.326
Am I close?

33:12.327 --> 33:15.096
You just proved me right.

33:15.097 --> 33:16.230
You know what?

33:16.231 --> 33:20.267
You've been a real jerk ever
since we got to the cabin.

33:20.268 --> 33:22.103
What do you want from me?

33:22.104 --> 33:23.004
To be cheery?

33:23.005 --> 33:25.139
Whistle a tune?

33:25.140 --> 33:28.142
Mom and Dad are missing,
maybe dead.

33:28.143 --> 33:30.344
The world's falling apart,
Silas.

33:30.345 --> 33:32.780
I'm not going to put on a
happy face for your sake.

33:32.781 --> 33:37.017
Then do so for Kylie's.

33:37.018 --> 33:38.786
She's afraid, Ez.

33:38.787 --> 33:42.390
I found her hiding in
the cellar this morning.

33:42.391 --> 33:44.658
Lynn's afraid too.

33:44.659 --> 33:47.728
She might seem like she's
holding it together, but...

33:47.729 --> 33:49.964
she isn't.

33:49.965 --> 33:54.068
You belong with your family.

33:54.069 --> 33:57.171
I'm the one with the
least to lose, right?

33:57.172 --> 33:59.807
If anybody should
be taking risks,

33:59.808 --> 34:02.244
it's me.

34:05.113 --> 34:09.083
Go back to the cabin, Silas.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.418
Seriously?

34:10.418 --> 34:12.686
You have that little
confidence in me?

34:12.687 --> 34:13.455
Hey!

34:13.456 --> 34:14.822
I asked you a question!

34:14.822 --> 34:16.623
You want to know what it is?

34:16.625 --> 34:18.025
You don't listen!

34:18.025 --> 34:20.860
You open a business
I tell you you can't afford,

34:20.862 --> 34:23.364
borrow money from Mom and Dad
they can't afford to give you.

34:23.364 --> 34:24.465
What are you?

34:24.466 --> 34:26.367
I get you a job that
you can't even hold.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.967
Then a week ago,

34:27.969 --> 34:31.539
I see you with that black eye
from some fight you were in.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.107
I don't trust you, Silas.

34:33.108 --> 34:34.542
I can't.

34:34.543 --> 34:36.311
You've given me way
too many reasons not to.

34:38.213 --> 34:41.614
You're right.

34:41.616 --> 34:43.350
I messed up.

34:43.351 --> 34:46.353
I should've listened.

34:46.353 --> 34:50.623
Excuse me for trying to do
the right thing for once.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.193
And that black eye?

34:52.194 --> 34:54.527
I fell.

34:54.529 --> 34:56.398
Not a fight.

35:12.848 --> 35:17.117
Why didn't you mention
your brother before?

35:17.118 --> 35:19.453
'Cause I didn't know what
I wanted to do about it.

35:19.454 --> 35:21.755
And now you do?

35:21.756 --> 35:23.257
The Sparks healed you.

35:23.258 --> 35:26.126
Maybe they can heal him too.

35:26.127 --> 35:28.496
Meaning you're going
to look for him.

35:28.497 --> 35:30.331
He's my brother.

35:30.332 --> 35:31.332
Is he?

35:31.600 --> 35:33.767
He tried to infect you,

35:33.768 --> 35:35.503
kill you.

35:35.504 --> 35:36.770
Whoever that person is out there

35:36.771 --> 35:39.273
isn't your brother anymore.

35:39.274 --> 35:40.641
I have to try.

35:40.642 --> 35:43.310
Try and get yourself killed.

35:43.311 --> 35:45.045
Or worse, taken.

35:45.046 --> 35:46.280
Made one of them.

35:46.281 --> 35:47.281
You don't understand.

35:47.282 --> 35:48.183
No, you don't understand.

35:48.184 --> 35:50.351
There are three of us, Ezra.

35:50.352 --> 35:51.685
You, me, Feena.

35:51.686 --> 35:52.454
That's it.

35:52.455 --> 35:54.288
That's the human race.

35:54.289 --> 35:55.023
We can't lose you.

35:55.024 --> 35:57.124
I can't lose him.

35:57.125 --> 36:01.061
Not again.

36:01.062 --> 36:03.063
He needs to know that I'm sorry.

36:03.064 --> 36:04.798
He won't hear you.

36:04.799 --> 36:11.005
Well, I still need to say it.

36:11.006 --> 36:13.908
Everyone makes mistakes, Ezra.

36:13.909 --> 36:16.176
Yeah.

36:16.177 --> 36:20.515
But not everyone gets a
chance to put 'em right.

36:41.002 --> 36:46.006
So, you boys stayed behind?

36:46.007 --> 36:47.508
Your brothers took
a trip to the lake

36:47.509 --> 36:50.811
and you're stuck babysitting me.

36:50.812 --> 36:53.514
Lucky you.

36:53.515 --> 36:57.785
Well, I hope your boys get back
soon with some alien magic

36:57.786 --> 37:02.122
because I'm either seeing
ghosts or hallucinating...

37:02.123 --> 37:05.292
and neither bodes well
for my health.

37:05.293 --> 37:06.293
You're not hallucinating.

37:07.929 --> 37:09.296
And I'm not a ghost.

37:09.297 --> 37:11.066
At least, not in a
traditional sense.

37:15.737 --> 37:18.138
The inside of the drone
is extremely delicate,

37:18.139 --> 37:19.974
so you can't poke
around like that.

37:19.975 --> 37:21.409
You'll make it worse.

37:25.981 --> 37:28.082
I'm not a projection, Feena.

37:28.083 --> 37:29.984
I'm manipulated light.

37:29.985 --> 37:31.418
From where?

37:31.419 --> 37:36.791
The drone, using reflective
surfaces in its environment.

37:40.362 --> 37:41.996
Hologram.

37:41.997 --> 37:43.998
The drone carries
multiple brain states,

37:43.999 --> 37:46.834
so it can bring any one of them
to the forefront when needed.

37:46.835 --> 37:49.336
You're a real person.

37:49.337 --> 37:51.538
Real in the sense that
this is my mind.

37:51.539 --> 37:54.842
These are the words I would say
had we had this conversation

37:54.843 --> 37:57.611
in my lifetime,
but this isn't a memory.

37:57.612 --> 37:59.313
The drone is helping me.

37:59.314 --> 38:01.316
Shaping my words
based on who I am.

38:02.617 --> 38:03.617
You're an A.I.

38:04.953 --> 38:07.788
That's a crude way
of putting it, yeah.

38:07.789 --> 38:09.590
So...

38:09.591 --> 38:11.291
the Sparks.

38:11.292 --> 38:13.160
They can make you?

38:13.161 --> 38:14.828
The real you, I mean.

38:14.829 --> 38:19.066
In theory, assuming
you can repair the drone.

38:19.067 --> 38:20.300
I don't know how.

38:20.301 --> 38:21.970
I can help you.

38:24.239 --> 38:27.341
Why can't the drone
just tell me?

38:27.342 --> 38:29.143
Because most of him,
including his voice,

38:29.144 --> 38:31.478
is still inoperative.

38:31.479 --> 38:33.915
I'm the best he can do
right now.

38:35.250 --> 38:37.451
What do I do?

38:37.452 --> 38:40.689
We proceed very carefully.

38:42.157 --> 38:42.857
Quickly!

38:42.858 --> 38:44.158
You must leave.

38:44.159 --> 38:45.293
Skin Riders are approaching.

38:49.698 --> 38:51.165
What about the Sparks?

38:51.166 --> 38:53.200
I'll keep them deep and hidden.

38:53.201 --> 38:54.668
And us?

38:54.669 --> 38:56.737
Follow the scout.

38:56.738 --> 38:58.238
It'll lead you out
on a different route

38:58.239 --> 39:00.274
back to the settlement.

39:00.275 --> 39:02.042
Without the vaccine?

39:02.043 --> 39:03.277
When it's safe to return,

39:03.278 --> 39:04.445
I'll find you.

39:04.446 --> 39:06.113
We can't keep Feena waiting.

39:06.114 --> 39:07.281
You must.

39:07.282 --> 39:08.283
Now go.

39:20.462 --> 39:21.463
Ezra!

39:40.281 --> 39:41.149
We split up.

39:41.150 --> 39:42.416
You follow Scout.

39:42.417 --> 39:43.417
And you?

39:57.165 --> 39:58.165
This way!

40:35.336 --> 40:36.336
Move!

40:52.821 --> 40:53.655
What is that?

40:53.655 --> 40:54.422
Don't hurt it!

40:54.423 --> 40:56.858
I'll die if you do.

40:57.792 --> 40:59.026
What have they done to you?

40:59.027 --> 41:02.329
Opened my mind.

41:02.330 --> 41:04.331
Don't kill him!

41:04.332 --> 41:05.332
I won't.

41:20.014 --> 41:23.550
If you try to run,
I'll call the others.

41:23.551 --> 41:25.686
You wouldn't get far.

41:25.687 --> 41:28.122
I sent Jax to find your friend.

41:33.862 --> 41:36.163
We haven't injected you.

41:36.164 --> 41:38.131
Jax wanted to, but...

41:38.132 --> 41:41.668
I think it's best if
you choose to join us.

41:41.669 --> 41:43.338
I'll pass.

41:45.073 --> 41:48.375
Four hundred years and
you haven't changed.

41:48.376 --> 41:49.644
Nobody can teach you anything.

41:53.381 --> 41:54.715
Did the Sparks remake you?

41:54.716 --> 41:56.817
The Sparks?

41:56.818 --> 41:58.752
Fascinating, aren't they?

41:58.753 --> 42:00.587
How they can make anything-

42:00.588 --> 42:03.090
Humans, clothing,

42:03.091 --> 42:07.261
a bologna sandwich,
albeit a soggy one.

42:07.262 --> 42:09.263
That thing on the
back of your neck-

42:09.264 --> 42:10.265
It's alive, isn't it?

42:10.932 --> 42:13.200
A companion.

42:13.201 --> 42:17.104
It teaches me, comforts me,

42:17.105 --> 42:20.374
connects me to my
brothers and sisters.

42:20.375 --> 42:21.608
I'm your brother, Silas.

42:21.609 --> 42:23.677
You were.

42:23.678 --> 42:26.113
Join us and you will be again.

42:26.114 --> 42:28.148
It controls you.

42:28.149 --> 42:30.484
Does knowledge control you?

42:30.485 --> 42:32.853
That's what the
companion provides.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.955
If I need to know
how to start a fire,

42:34.956 --> 42:36.556
it shows me.

42:36.557 --> 42:37.458
It's a gift!

42:37.459 --> 42:39.826
Can you remove it?

42:39.827 --> 42:41.461
Why would I want to?

42:41.462 --> 42:43.497
Because it turned you
into someone else.

42:43.498 --> 42:47.367
Someone better, yes.

42:47.368 --> 42:51.338
What was I to you before
other than a disappointment?

42:51.339 --> 42:53.540
Now look at me.

42:53.541 --> 42:54.975
A leader.

42:54.976 --> 42:58.812
A spiritual advisor.

42:58.813 --> 43:00.148
I'm worth something now.

45:10.278 --> 45:12.913
Ezra?

45:12.914 --> 45:14.815
Silas?

45:14.816 --> 45:16.917
I'm here!

45:16.918 --> 45:17.918
I'm here!

45:29.430 --> 45:31.265
I can't see.

45:35.169 --> 45:37.671
You weren't a disappointment,
Silas.

45:37.672 --> 45:38.772
Bankrupt at 20?

45:38.773 --> 45:40.040
Because you hired
all those people,

45:40.041 --> 45:42.042
and you didn't have
the heart to let 'em go

45:42.043 --> 45:43.343
when you should have.

45:43.344 --> 45:44.444
It makes you a bad businessman,

45:44.445 --> 45:45.313
not a bad person.

45:45.313 --> 45:46.313
Doesn't matter.

45:47.181 --> 45:49.282
I'm the person I want to be now.

45:49.283 --> 45:50.283
A slave?

45:52.153 --> 45:53.153
A servant.

45:55.356 --> 45:57.057
Let me take you to the Sparks.

45:57.058 --> 45:58.125
They can heal you!

45:58.126 --> 46:00.961
And go back to what I was?

46:00.962 --> 46:03.965
What you were was
a better man, Silas.

46:19.847 --> 46:21.849
My companion is very tired.

46:49.677 --> 46:51.945
He let you go?

46:51.946 --> 46:54.214
The bump on their necks
is a parasite.

46:54.215 --> 46:56.283
I think his fell asleep.

46:56.284 --> 46:58.552
And for a moment,
the real Silas came through.

46:58.553 --> 47:00.954
He signaled for me to go.

47:00.955 --> 47:02.455
That doesn't mean
you can save him.

47:02.456 --> 47:05.625
It means I have to try.

47:05.626 --> 47:07.894
You think the Skin Riders
got the Sparks?

47:07.895 --> 47:09.763
If they did,
Feena'll be in a bad way.

47:09.764 --> 47:11.631
We both will.

47:11.632 --> 47:13.167
I've had two nosebleeds.

47:15.336 --> 47:17.305
Bring us Yellow Drone
and the Sparks.

47:33.254 --> 47:36.256
Same plants the Sparks
made for us before.

47:36.257 --> 47:39.827
Food'll do us little good
if we're too weak to eat it.

47:47.101 --> 47:50.003
Carry what you can.

47:50.004 --> 47:51.638
What about the vaccine?

47:51.639 --> 47:53.607
The Sparks made
several capsules.

47:53.608 --> 47:55.709
These three are for
you two and Feena.

47:55.710 --> 47:57.578
I have extras,
should we ever need them.

48:06.621 --> 48:07.955
Bottoms up.

48:13.594 --> 48:15.662
Fly this to Feena
as fast as you can.

48:15.663 --> 48:17.264
Negative.

48:17.265 --> 48:20.233
I am instructed to ensure that
you return to the settlement.

48:20.234 --> 48:21.735
There may not be time for that.

48:21.736 --> 48:23.570
I must follow my instructions.

48:23.571 --> 48:25.505
And I'm giving you
new instructions.

48:25.506 --> 48:28.308
Humans may have ruled machines
in your life, Ezra,

48:28.309 --> 48:30.176
but not in this one.

48:30.177 --> 48:33.146
I can run.

48:33.147 --> 48:34.448
The straightest path.

48:39.820 --> 48:44.125
Feena, can you hear me?

48:46.494 --> 48:48.194
Stay awake for me, okay?

48:48.195 --> 48:52.265
Try and focus.

48:52.266 --> 48:53.967
She's dying and
I can't help her.

48:53.968 --> 48:57.537
She needs someone she knows
by her side.

48:57.538 --> 48:58.539
Please.

49:03.311 --> 49:05.479
Feena.

49:11.118 --> 49:12.119
You're here.

49:13.120 --> 49:16.122
Yeah.

49:16.123 --> 49:18.726
Yeah, I'm here.

49:22.330 --> 49:24.398
You let him go?

49:30.838 --> 49:32.605
Neither of you
deserves this world.

49:32.606 --> 49:34.140
NO!

49:34.141 --> 49:36.643
You're wrong about humans!

49:36.644 --> 49:37.644
They're good.

49:37.645 --> 49:38.945
And that's why you hate them-

49:38.946 --> 49:42.683
because they love and
you don't understand it.

49:44.251 --> 49:46.653
You think you're
one of them now?

49:46.654 --> 49:48.321
Then die like one.

49:48.322 --> 49:49.490
Forgotten.

49:53.527 --> 49:57.097
We both fell asleep.

49:57.098 --> 49:58.099
It was his watch!

49:58.332 --> 50:01.267
We don't kill our own.

50:01.268 --> 50:02.303
Not without counsel.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.287
It's you.

50:21.288 --> 50:23.857
Disappointed?

50:23.858 --> 50:26.292
I was just...

50:26.293 --> 50:28.028
dreaming of someone else.

50:31.465 --> 50:33.833
How do you feel?

50:33.834 --> 50:35.235
Not so good.

50:35.236 --> 50:39.072
You look better than you did.

50:39.073 --> 50:40.206
The vaccine?

50:40.207 --> 50:42.375
Yellow says you'll be
down for a few days,

50:42.376 --> 50:45.578
but you're going to be okay.

50:45.579 --> 50:46.981
Thank you.

50:54.588 --> 50:57.424
Where are we?

50:57.425 --> 50:58.625
Living quarters.

50:58.626 --> 51:03.263
Abram found them.

51:03.264 --> 51:05.765
I saw Red Drone
on the work table.

51:05.766 --> 51:06.834
Any luck fixing it?

51:09.303 --> 51:11.104
No.

51:11.105 --> 51:12.105
No luck.

51:14.375 --> 51:15.376
Try to get some rest.

51:37.298 --> 51:38.298
Lynn!

51:40.568 --> 51:42.235
He's blind.

51:42.236 --> 51:43.637
Follow me.

51:44.305 --> 51:50.481
