03:55.070 --> 03:56.939
Mr. Hosokawa, we are
very honored to have

03:57.039 --> 03:58.073
you in our country, sir.

03:58.173 --> 04:00.442
I'm honored to be
here, Mr. Vice President.

04:00.542 --> 04:01.609
Thank you, sir.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.346
And please, I say my
apology that the president

04:04.446 --> 04:06.414
was unable to attend.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.584
He was called into
some talks with Israel.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.331
Mr. Hosokawa understands
that affairs of state

04:23.431 --> 04:24.332
must take precedence.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.834
He's a mere businessman.

04:25.934 --> 04:26.969
No, no, no.

04:27.069 --> 04:28.570
And tomorrow I
would like to show

04:28.670 --> 04:30.138
you to some potential
building sites

04:30.238 --> 04:31.840
for a factory.

04:31.940 --> 04:32.340
S .

04:34.676 --> 04:35.944
Ey.

04:36.044 --> 04:38.246
This is Monsieur and Madame
Ambassador of France Thibault.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.082
- What a pleasure.
- Enchante.

04:40.182 --> 04:41.984
Nice to meet you.

04:42.084 --> 04:46.121
And thank you for the presence
of this amazing talent.

04:46.221 --> 04:47.622
Arigato.

04:53.996 --> 04:55.730
Mr. Hosokawa is
grateful for the chance

04:55.830 --> 04:58.166
to hear Ms. Coss in such
an intimate setting.

04:58.266 --> 05:00.335
It is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

05:00.435 --> 05:01.703
The flight?

05:01.803 --> 05:03.238
It was a long and bumpy.

05:03.338 --> 05:04.572
And there are
soldiers everywhere,

05:04.672 --> 05:06.641
waving their guns around.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.444
It's absolutely terrifying.

05:09.544 --> 05:13.048
So Italy, England,
United States.

05:13.148 --> 05:14.416
I mean it.

05:14.516 --> 05:18.453
Italy, England, United States
for the next year at least.

05:18.553 --> 05:19.988
Not even Teatro Col n.

05:20.088 --> 05:20.822
No, I don't care.

05:20.923 --> 05:21.990
I don't care how much they pay.

05:23.825 --> 05:24.226
Hang on.

05:24.326 --> 05:24.726
Yes?

05:27.829 --> 05:29.031
They're ready.

05:29.131 --> 05:30.232
Right, they're...

05:30.332 --> 05:30.899
they're ready.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.034
I'll call you back.

05:32.134 --> 05:34.002
OK, bye.

05:34.102 --> 05:37.205
Good.

05:37.305 --> 05:38.040
Let's get this over with.

05:46.214 --> 05:49.651
In my country, opera
is a sacred thing.

05:49.751 --> 05:50.418
So to...

06:03.298 --> 06:03.831
Gracias.

06:03.932 --> 06:05.367
You look lovely.

06:05.467 --> 06:06.368
Good evening.

06:06.468 --> 06:07.602
Thank you, Miss Coss.

06:07.702 --> 06:08.103
Hola.

06:08.203 --> 06:09.271
Hello.

06:09.371 --> 06:12.540
Mr. Hosokawa, may I
present Ms. Roxanne Coss?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.076
It is a great pleasure.

06:14.176 --> 06:18.013
No, the
pleasure's all mine.

06:18.113 --> 06:20.949
So I understand you would
like to hear Rusalka?

06:24.819 --> 06:27.489
He enjoyed hearing
you sing it in Vienna.

06:27.589 --> 06:29.224
Thank you.

06:31.293 --> 06:33.695
If a human soul
should dream of me,

06:33.795 --> 06:35.463
may he still remember
me on awaking.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.166
Well, that's a poetic thought.

06:38.266 --> 06:40.235
I will finish my
program with it.

06:41.369 --> 06:42.971
You know it's Little Mermaid.

06:44.339 --> 06:45.540
Yes.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.443
But it's opera, so in
the end, everybody dies.

06:52.380 --> 06:53.815
Shall we?

06:53.915 --> 06:56.684
Let's begin.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.280
Sh-sh-sh.

08:05.220 --> 08:05.620
Shh.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.029
Shh.

08:59.807 --> 09:00.675
Translator.

09:00.775 --> 09:01.476
Tr... tr... trans...

09:02.244 --> 09:03.611
S , s , s .

09:45.453 --> 09:46.388
I will never leave you.

09:46.488 --> 09:47.555
I swear.
- Get off.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.224
Get off.
I can't breathe.

12:04.225 --> 12:07.128
Please.

12:07.228 --> 12:08.195
No, No.

12:08.296 --> 12:09.196
I'm all... I'm all right.

12:09.297 --> 12:09.697
I'm...

12:12.767 --> 12:13.167
Please?

12:21.242 --> 12:24.612
Thank you.

12:24.712 --> 12:25.613
Arigato.

14:41.816 --> 14:43.685
Messner.

14:43.785 --> 14:47.689
I'm with International
Committee of the Red Cross.

14:47.789 --> 14:48.189
I'm unarmed.

14:55.029 --> 14:58.633
Are you
sure you want to come in?

14:58.733 --> 15:01.102
Because there's no guarantee
they're going to let you out.

15:01.202 --> 15:02.970
They will let me out.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.006
More hostages is not what
they're looking for now.

15:11.513 --> 15:11.879
In!

15:32.166 --> 15:33.535
Who are you?

15:33.635 --> 15:35.870
Messner.

15:35.970 --> 15:38.005
I'm Swiss.

15:44.345 --> 15:45.680
I speak a little English.

15:45.780 --> 15:46.881
My comrades do not.

15:46.981 --> 15:48.149
I have a translator outside.

15:48.249 --> 15:50.552
No, no one else.

15:50.652 --> 15:52.854
We have a translator.

15:52.954 --> 15:55.389
Wait.

15:55.489 --> 15:57.258
Translator!

16:10.371 --> 16:12.406
You will translate?

16:12.506 --> 16:12.907
English?

16:13.007 --> 16:13.675
French?

16:13.775 --> 16:14.642
Do you have a preference?

16:14.742 --> 16:17.545
No preference.

16:17.645 --> 16:19.914
What we want, of course,
is the unconditional release

16:20.014 --> 16:21.849
of all the hostages.

16:21.949 --> 16:22.650
Unharmed.

16:29.791 --> 16:31.626
Send in President Masuda.

16:31.726 --> 16:33.728
They came for the
president and will release

16:33.828 --> 16:35.262
everyone in exchange for him.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.831
They won't give
you the president.

16:36.931 --> 16:39.066
That's who we came here for.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.570
Well, I came here
on vacation to relax.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.606
It seems like no one is
going to get what they want.

16:50.878 --> 16:52.546
Someone needs to
sew up that cut.

16:52.647 --> 16:53.815
I'm going to call in a medic.
- No!

16:53.915 --> 16:54.415
No medics!

16:54.515 --> 16:55.382
No sewing.

16:57.652 --> 16:59.553
It was never a
pretty face anyway.

16:59.654 --> 17:02.123
Nothing will proceed if
this man bleeds to death.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.577
IS there a doctor here?

17:23.678 --> 17:24.478
There must be a doctor.

17:45.099 --> 17:47.635
We only have five minutes.

17:47.735 --> 17:48.402
Don't worry.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.972
I'm trained at first aid.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.744
One, two.

17:59.313 --> 18:00.214
I'm sorry.

18:23.705 --> 18:24.605
No.

18:24.706 --> 18:25.606
No.

18:30.678 --> 18:31.578
No.

18:31.679 --> 18:35.049
Ay, no.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.370
All of you, lay down.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.705
I don't lie down.

19:31.806 --> 19:33.074
I wait outside.

19:33.174 --> 19:34.608
Get your demands ready.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.711
I'll be back in an hour.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.357
Yes, I'm coming.

20:58.692 --> 21:02.864
We let you have
the woman, workers,

21:02.964 --> 21:04.866
priests, anyone who's sick.

21:09.503 --> 21:12.139
The first page are
things we need.

21:12.239 --> 21:14.808
The second one is to
be read to the press...

21:14.909 --> 21:16.010
our demands.

21:16.110 --> 21:18.846
"All political prisoners
held in the government's

21:18.946 --> 21:21.182
illegal jails must be freed."

21:21.282 --> 21:21.983
All of them.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.618
All of them.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.592
GEN: They are their
brothers and sisters.

21:31.692 --> 21:35.162
They are prepared
to die for them.

21:35.262 --> 21:37.231
No one has to die.

21:37.331 --> 21:40.902
Well, we all have to someday.

21:41.002 --> 21:43.737
But as far as right now,
it is up to the government.

21:43.837 --> 21:47.708
If there is blood, it
will be on their hands.

21:54.081 --> 21:57.384
We ask you all to stand
up and approach, please.

22:08.495 --> 22:13.867
The women to the far right of
the room, men to the far left.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.157
What's wrong with you?

22:36.257 --> 22:37.091
Insulin.

22:37.191 --> 22:38.192
My insulin is back at the hotel.

22:38.292 --> 22:39.126
You're diabetic?

22:39.226 --> 22:39.660
Yeah.

22:39.760 --> 22:40.461
Help!

22:40.561 --> 22:42.296
Help!

22:42.396 --> 22:43.030
We need help!

22:43.130 --> 22:44.966
This man is sick.

22:45.066 --> 22:45.599
He's sick.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.333
He needs medicine.

22:52.306 --> 22:53.107
OK.

22:53.207 --> 22:54.475
OK, it's OK.

22:54.575 --> 22:55.842
It's OK.
- It's OK.

22:55.943 --> 22:56.510
No, it's not.

22:56.610 --> 22:57.211
Come on.

23:48.095 --> 23:51.198
All right, we're
going to move out now.

23:51.298 --> 23:52.633
Women first.

23:52.733 --> 23:54.635
Follow me.

23:57.671 --> 24:00.774
MESSNER: Calm and quiet.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.009
Everything's going
to be all right.

24:02.109 --> 24:02.509
Move on.

24:05.846 --> 24:06.713
Let's go.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.568
Hey!

25:06.673 --> 25:08.575
Remain calm.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.643
Move on.

25:09.743 --> 25:10.511
What... what are you doing?

25:10.611 --> 25:12.213
We're all going to get out.

25:12.313 --> 25:13.046
Remain calm.

25:17.284 --> 25:20.121
You OK?

25:20.221 --> 25:23.190
It's OK, it's OK.

25:23.290 --> 25:23.824
Go in the bus.

25:23.924 --> 25:24.525
Go in the bus!

25:24.625 --> 25:26.227
Please, go into the bus!

25:26.327 --> 25:26.793
Thank you.

25:26.893 --> 25:27.428
All in the bus.

25:27.528 --> 25:28.162
Where's Roxanne?

25:31.698 --> 25:33.367
Hey, hey, hey!

25:33.467 --> 25:34.601
She's not outside!

25:34.701 --> 25:37.104
Roxanne Coss is not outside!

25:37.204 --> 25:38.205
Roxanne!

25:38.305 --> 25:38.839
Where is she?

25:41.608 --> 25:42.443
Roxanne!

25:47.381 --> 25:49.015
No!

25:51.585 --> 25:52.953
Let me back in!

25:53.053 --> 25:54.421
Let me back in!

25:54.521 --> 25:55.889
Call an ambulance!

25:58.892 --> 25:59.293
OK.

25:59.393 --> 26:00.761
It's OK.

26:00.861 --> 26:01.262
It's OK.

26:01.362 --> 26:02.229
You're OK.

26:08.202 --> 26:09.170
Catholic?

26:09.270 --> 26:10.837
I... I... I don't know.

26:10.937 --> 26:11.838
I... I don't know.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.039
He's... he's Norwegian.

26:14.441 --> 26:15.542
I never asked him.

26:16.310 --> 26:17.344
Me?

26:17.444 --> 26:18.445
S , cat lica.

26:18.545 --> 26:20.013
I was... I was brought
up Catholic, but I...

26:20.113 --> 26:20.947
I don't know about him.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.149
I just... I just work with him.

26:22.249 --> 26:22.816
I don't...

26:29.590 --> 26:31.692
You're giving him last rites?

27:33.687 --> 27:37.791
The singer has to come
out now, Mr. Watanabe.

27:39.025 --> 27:39.826
No!

27:43.129 --> 27:44.898
No, only if the
president comes.

27:44.998 --> 27:46.700
You said all women.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.802
How can I continue negotiating
if I cannot trust you?

27:48.902 --> 27:51.438
Listen, Red Cross.

27:51.538 --> 27:52.906
We are not on the same side.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.508
I never take sides.

27:54.608 --> 27:56.109
Then you are on
the side of power.

27:56.209 --> 27:58.111
You're the one carrying a gun.

27:58.211 --> 28:00.814
You have the power in
here, so let her go.

28:00.914 --> 28:01.948
Please.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.684
I said no.

28:03.784 --> 28:06.253
We need her now
more than before.

28:06.353 --> 28:06.887
She stays.

28:10.257 --> 28:10.724
Hey.

28:19.933 --> 28:21.802
Here's some antibiotics.

28:21.902 --> 28:23.537
You should take them.

28:23.637 --> 28:25.005
OK.

28:25.105 --> 28:26.106
Gracias.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.974
I... I... I... I don't
think they should have

28:28.074 --> 28:30.311
brought in the food like this.

28:30.411 --> 28:32.479
They could have made
two separate trips out...

28:32.579 --> 28:33.714
out of respect.

28:33.814 --> 28:36.082
They don't have any respect
for anything or anyone.

28:36.182 --> 28:36.817
They're not human.

28:40.321 --> 28:42.923
I will try and get you out
of here as soon as possible.

28:43.023 --> 28:43.924
Thank you.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.382
My employer,
Mr. Hosokawa, asks

30:15.482 --> 30:18.652
me to offer his condolences.

30:18.752 --> 30:21.354
He wanted me to tell you
that your accompanist

30:21.455 --> 30:23.424
was very talented.

30:23.524 --> 30:25.626
That's very kind of him.

30:25.726 --> 30:28.361
Will you say his name for
me again, your employer.

30:28.462 --> 30:29.530
Mister?

30:29.630 --> 30:31.465
Hosokawa.

30:31.565 --> 30:35.902
He feels responsible for all
that's happening right now.

30:36.002 --> 30:36.870
No, he didn't shoot anyone.

30:44.044 --> 30:46.046
Mr. Hosokawa?

30:46.146 --> 30:50.350
Gen tells me you feel,
in some way, responsible.

30:50.451 --> 30:52.986
You're not.

30:59.092 --> 31:01.094
He came to hear
you sing in exchange

31:01.194 --> 31:05.766
for building a factory here,
which he never intended to do.

31:10.471 --> 31:13.674
It was a vanity to accept
a gift of a private concert

31:13.774 --> 31:15.108
by such a great artist.

31:22.616 --> 31:25.085
He's always
moved by your work.

31:25.185 --> 31:28.354
He's heard you sing at La
Scala, London, and New York.

31:28.455 --> 31:30.624
He must love opera.

31:30.724 --> 31:31.124
Yeah.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.501
GEN: For him, your
voice is opera.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.610
He feels responsible for
your accompanist's death.

31:49.710 --> 31:50.944
No, no, no.

31:51.044 --> 31:52.345
No.

31:52.445 --> 31:56.883
Please, I sing at many,
many private parties

31:56.983 --> 31:58.218
all over the world.

31:58.318 --> 32:00.587
With all due respect, I didn't
come here to sing for you.

32:00.687 --> 32:02.556
I came because they paid me.

32:05.626 --> 32:09.062
If anything, I'm to blame.

32:09.162 --> 32:11.131
I turned down this engagement
several times till they

32:11.231 --> 32:12.766
came up with enough money.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.707
No, no, no, believe me,
I am very capable of blame.

32:20.807 --> 32:22.743
I just don't blame you.

32:40.360 --> 32:40.961
What is it?

32:41.061 --> 32:41.494
Meat.

32:42.395 --> 32:43.597
No, no, no.

32:43.697 --> 32:45.599
Yeah, I could see that it's
meat, but what kind is it?

32:45.699 --> 32:46.432
I don't know.

32:46.533 --> 32:47.601
It's probably better not to ask.

34:42.783 --> 34:43.684
Gracias.

35:24.224 --> 35:27.160
Dah, dah, dah, dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah!

35:27.260 --> 35:27.660
Pah!

35:27.761 --> 35:28.695
Pah, pah!

36:38.031 --> 36:39.565
No!

36:41.067 --> 36:43.169
Thank you.

36:43.269 --> 36:46.039
Gracias.

36:46.139 --> 36:49.442
The government has turned
off the water to the house

36:49.542 --> 36:53.046
to make things more
uncomfortable for us.

36:54.047 --> 36:55.849
I gathered that.

36:55.949 --> 36:59.385
We need water.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.054
My comrade, Comandante
Alfredo, wants

37:01.154 --> 37:04.024
to shoot someone just to
show the government who

37:04.124 --> 37:05.525
is in charge.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.260
But I have another thought.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.061
What's that?

37:08.161 --> 37:10.530
I want you to sing.

37:10.630 --> 37:13.867
I want you to sing loudly enough
that these animals outside

37:13.967 --> 37:14.935
can hear it.

37:15.035 --> 37:16.636
What good would that do?

37:16.736 --> 37:21.541
It might remind
them what is at stake.

37:21.641 --> 37:23.810
Ha.

37:23.910 --> 37:24.845
No.

37:24.945 --> 37:25.812
I won't sing.

37:25.912 --> 37:27.347
Not for you.

37:30.150 --> 37:32.819
He says to do
what you are told.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.054
Or what?

37:34.154 --> 37:35.321
You'll shoot me?

37:35.421 --> 37:40.760
You've kept one woman, one
American, una americana.

37:40.861 --> 37:42.963
If you shoot me, what
do you think will

37:43.063 --> 37:45.131
happen to you and your people?

37:45.231 --> 37:46.466
I don't think I need
to do what you say.

37:56.009 --> 37:59.846
Madame Coss, we will not
last long here without water,

37:59.946 --> 38:02.115
but we will not surrender.

38:02.215 --> 38:06.386
We need to free our
brothers and sisters.

38:06.486 --> 38:08.788
We here are all they have.

38:08.889 --> 38:12.893
So please, sing.

38:12.993 --> 38:15.095
When they hear the
beauty of your voice,

38:15.195 --> 38:18.764
these government criminals,
perhaps they will find

38:18.865 --> 38:22.302
a solution to our situation.

38:22.402 --> 38:24.670
Where'd you learn English?

38:24.770 --> 38:28.708
At university.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.343
I'm a teacher.

38:30.443 --> 38:32.979
I was a teacher.

38:33.079 --> 38:35.248
History.

38:35.348 --> 38:37.150
Once upon a time.

38:42.022 --> 38:45.926
I've never gone a week without
singing unless I was sick.

38:46.026 --> 38:49.329
I'm going to have to
start practicing soon.

38:49.429 --> 38:51.998
I just don't want to give
them the satisfaction.

38:52.098 --> 38:57.537
Mr. Hosokawa, what do you think?

38:57.637 --> 38:59.472
You think I should sing?

39:10.050 --> 39:13.253
He says your voice
never belonged to them.

39:23.563 --> 39:28.301
Do either of you
play the piano?

39:28.401 --> 39:31.371
No.

39:31.471 --> 39:33.239
When did you first
listen to opera?

39:37.843 --> 39:40.513
When he was a child,
his father took him.

39:42.615 --> 39:44.850
And when did
you start singing?

39:44.951 --> 39:47.187
I don't know.

39:47.287 --> 39:48.288
I don't remember.

39:48.388 --> 39:50.390
My mother said that
I was always singing.

39:58.198 --> 39:58.965
Excuse me?

39:59.065 --> 39:59.799
Yes?

39:59.899 --> 40:03.036
Do you know how to play piano?

40:03.136 --> 40:06.206
Tell the Red Cross
to send in a teacher,

40:06.306 --> 40:07.740
and I will learn for her.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.709
Yes.
Thank you.

40:09.809 --> 40:13.379
I would just sing, you know,
all day and... and all night.

40:13.479 --> 40:17.250
It was like a language
that I could speak.

40:17.350 --> 40:20.386
And then when I was
seven, my mother

40:20.486 --> 40:22.122
found a teacher for me, and...

40:22.222 --> 40:23.589
and that was it.

40:25.625 --> 40:26.926
And what about you?

40:27.027 --> 40:32.032
Um, when did you, um,
learn to do what you do?

40:38.038 --> 40:40.573
I started engineer.

40:41.441 --> 40:43.243
OK.

40:43.343 --> 40:44.077
Did you draw that?

40:44.177 --> 40:45.378
From window.

40:45.478 --> 40:47.380
Yes, yes, I'm very impressed.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.381
Monsieur Thibault?

40:48.481 --> 40:49.015
Oui.

40:50.850 --> 40:52.318
Yes.

40:52.418 --> 40:53.119
A little.

41:18.678 --> 41:19.579
Bravo!

41:19.679 --> 41:20.280
Bravo!

41:22.682 --> 41:24.084
Thank you.

41:24.184 --> 41:25.085
Thank you.

41:34.660 --> 41:35.728
Buenos d as.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.803
Gracias.

42:06.859 --> 42:08.128
You bought this?

42:08.228 --> 42:08.761
What?

42:08.861 --> 42:10.062
You bought this?

42:10.163 --> 42:12.665
No, they gave it to me.

42:12.765 --> 42:14.300
And the news stations?

42:14.400 --> 42:15.201
They've been all alerted.

42:24.244 --> 42:26.679
Why are you helping them?

42:26.779 --> 42:30.150
Because you need water, and
I don't want anyone else to get

42:30.250 --> 42:30.650
killed.

42:36.122 --> 42:38.224
Hey!

42:38.991 --> 42:39.992
Por favor.

42:40.092 --> 42:41.527
No.

42:44.197 --> 42:45.598
Mister, over here, please.

43:01.547 --> 43:05.318
Don't shoot.

43:05.418 --> 43:08.854
Do not shoot.

43:08.954 --> 43:11.023
You sure they won't shoot?

43:11.123 --> 43:13.959
Not everyone likes opera.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.535
Holy shit.

43:25.605 --> 43:27.940
I don't need that.

43:28.040 --> 43:28.741
No es bueno.

44:00.072 --> 44:01.241
I want to start over.

44:01.341 --> 44:02.242
What happened?

44:02.342 --> 44:03.576
I haven't sung in a week.

44:03.676 --> 44:05.378
I would like to start over.

44:05.478 --> 44:06.412
Are you able to do it?

44:06.512 --> 44:08.013
Yes, if you stop talking.

45:26.392 --> 45:29.595
That was one of the more
unique concerts I've attended.

45:41.941 --> 45:45.745
How did I do?

46:28.888 --> 46:32.858
Look at her, Gen. She's
staring right at you.

46:32.958 --> 46:35.995
I would like to speak to her.

46:36.095 --> 46:37.463
You'll be my translator.

46:42.968 --> 46:44.904
Do you speak Spanish?

46:45.004 --> 46:47.206
He's quite good at it.

47:11.964 --> 47:12.798
MAN: Carmen!

47:15.735 --> 47:19.905
Nice asking her
about the music.

47:27.580 --> 47:30.483
Madame Coss.

47:30.583 --> 47:33.385
I want to say thank
you for your help.

47:33.486 --> 47:37.923
Well, if you'd really like to
thank me, you could release me.

47:38.023 --> 47:40.225
And everyone else.

47:40.325 --> 47:42.495
I'm afraid I can't.

47:42.595 --> 47:48.400
But I can give you some more
comfortable accommodations.

48:04.717 --> 48:05.117
Hola.

48:08.488 --> 48:09.388
Por favor.

48:17.963 --> 48:22.234
I sang for my supper,
and this is my reward.

48:22.334 --> 48:25.204
Um,

48:27.172 --> 48:28.007
Carmen.

48:28.107 --> 48:29.475
Carmen.

48:29.575 --> 48:31.076
Um.

48:31.176 --> 48:33.679
Roxanne.

48:40.085 --> 48:41.453
Gracias.

48:41.554 --> 48:42.421
This is nice.

48:47.359 --> 48:48.327
Well.

48:48.427 --> 48:50.696
Um, it was nice...

48:50.796 --> 48:52.965
nice talking to you.

48:53.065 --> 48:55.000
Adios, Carmen.

48:55.100 --> 48:55.501
Gracias.

49:01.340 --> 49:02.474
Shall we get Gen?

49:02.575 --> 49:03.475
What's in the box?

49:03.576 --> 49:05.578
Sheet music and
lotion for Miss Coss.

49:05.678 --> 49:06.746
Playing cards.

49:09.849 --> 49:10.616
What the hell is going on?

49:27.700 --> 49:30.069
Are you CIA?

49:31.671 --> 49:33.072
What are you?

49:33.172 --> 49:34.940
I'm an idiot!

49:35.040 --> 49:35.975
That's what I am.

49:39.511 --> 49:41.380
I'm just a fucking
idiot spending

49:41.480 --> 49:46.051
his own life running back and
forth between people with guns!

49:46.151 --> 49:47.953
You think I knew about this?

49:48.053 --> 49:50.022
You think they tell me anything?

49:50.122 --> 49:51.290
They tell me nothing.

49:51.390 --> 49:52.091
Find someone else.

49:52.191 --> 49:53.793
Just find someone else!

50:27.326 --> 50:28.427
I found this in my room.

50:28.527 --> 50:30.763
I thought you might like it.

50:30.863 --> 50:32.464
No, no, I don't
really know how,

50:32.564 --> 50:34.066
and I hate being bad at things.

50:34.166 --> 50:36.301
So you play.

50:38.904 --> 50:39.304
Um.

50:42.808 --> 50:43.709
No.
No.

50:43.809 --> 50:44.810
Um.

50:48.180 --> 50:52.551
You're going to make
me learn, aren't you?

50:52.652 --> 50:53.518
Queen.

50:53.619 --> 50:55.888
OK.

50:55.988 --> 50:57.757
OK.

50:57.857 --> 50:59.091
This is going to take forever.

50:59.191 --> 51:00.559
Yeah.

52:33.485 --> 52:36.221
Shh.

54:01.606 --> 54:03.475
S .

54:56.761 --> 54:59.164
Knight, horse.

54:59.264 --> 55:00.132
Jumping.

55:00.232 --> 55:00.765
He can jump.

55:00.866 --> 55:02.067
So can I go...

55:02.767 --> 55:03.168
...Like that?

55:03.268 --> 55:04.136
No.

55:16.481 --> 55:18.884
Are you married?

55:18.984 --> 55:21.887
Are you married?

55:21.987 --> 55:22.387
Muy bien.

55:32.231 --> 55:35.600
Clumsy.

55:48.113 --> 55:50.983
One, two.

56:14.506 --> 56:17.442
Married you?

56:17.542 --> 56:19.844
Are you learning English?

56:24.249 --> 56:26.618
Bien.

56:26.718 --> 56:29.588
Well, I've been married twice.

56:29.688 --> 56:33.592
The first time I was very
young, and the marriage

56:33.692 --> 56:37.929
lasted four months.

56:38.030 --> 56:42.968
The second time, I married
my business manager.

56:43.068 --> 56:46.605
It was not a very good
investment on my part.

56:46.705 --> 56:53.278
But you
know, I was so lonely.

56:53.378 --> 56:55.981
So.

56:56.081 --> 56:59.584
What about everybody
else, do you think?

56:59.684 --> 57:02.787
How bout Mr. Hosokawa?

57:02.887 --> 57:04.789
Is he married?

57:44.096 --> 57:44.996
Ms. Coss?

57:49.868 --> 57:53.338
Chicago is a beautiful city.

57:53.438 --> 57:53.938
Yes.

57:54.039 --> 57:55.474
I'm from Chicago.

57:55.574 --> 57:56.908
Did I tell you that?

57:57.008 --> 57:57.576
It is.

57:57.676 --> 57:58.510
It's very beautiful.

57:58.610 --> 58:02.781
Um, it's cold in the wintertime.

58:02.881 --> 58:04.549
Very, very cold.

58:04.649 --> 58:06.218
And in the summer, it's hot.

58:06.318 --> 58:08.353
Almost unbearably hot.

58:09.888 --> 58:12.324
No, don't... don't translate
that, because he doesn't...

58:12.424 --> 58:13.758
he doesn't need to
know that I'm an idiot.

58:13.858 --> 58:16.195
It's OK.

58:18.230 --> 58:18.730
Is that me?

58:19.864 --> 58:20.965
It is?

58:21.066 --> 58:21.800
S .

58:21.900 --> 58:22.567
I see.

01:00:20.952 --> 01:00:22.187
Carmen.

01:00:46.645 --> 01:00:49.348
It's good timing.

01:00:49.448 --> 01:00:50.549
Is it?

01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:54.152
Yeah, I have some questions
about Anton Chekhov.

01:00:54.253 --> 01:00:55.654
Chekhov?

01:00:55.754 --> 01:00:57.656
No, I love Tolstoy
more than Chekhov,

01:00:57.756 --> 01:00:59.123
but we can talk about Chekhov.

01:00:59.758 --> 01:01:00.925
Are you OK?

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:01.793
You look unwell.

01:01:01.893 --> 01:01:02.894
Are you OK?

01:01:02.994 --> 01:01:04.263
No, I'm sure I'll be fine.

01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:06.765
You know, if... perhaps they
will let you go if you are ill.

01:01:06.865 --> 01:01:07.366
No, no, no.

01:01:07.466 --> 01:01:08.300
Yes.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.401
I have no
intention of leaving.

01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:10.702
I'm not leaving.

01:01:10.802 --> 01:01:11.636
Look.

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:16.641
The bathroom is empty now.

01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:22.281
Look, don't worry, Gen.
I can keep a secret.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:51.109
What's that for?

01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:11.396
Listen, just relax.

01:02:11.496 --> 01:02:16.034
Is it true that the government
is considering shooting us all?

01:02:16.134 --> 01:02:17.001
Why would they do that?

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:19.237
So as to pin it on the rebels.

01:02:19.338 --> 01:02:20.872
It doesn't seem to make sense.

01:02:20.972 --> 01:02:24.609
If the rebels panic,
they could kill all of us

01:02:24.709 --> 01:02:26.077
in a moment of desperation.

01:02:45.697 --> 01:02:48.400
You'll give this to
the government, please.

01:02:55.674 --> 01:02:57.509
We should talk about this.

01:02:57.609 --> 01:02:58.777
This cannot go on any longer.

01:02:58.877 --> 01:02:59.544
Shh.

01:02:59.644 --> 01:03:00.779
Please, they are playing.

01:03:00.879 --> 01:03:01.279
Come on.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.246
Sit down.

01:03:02.347 --> 01:03:04.716
So now this is
a chess academy?

01:03:04.816 --> 01:03:05.650
Sit down.

01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:14.593
You were a teacher before
all this, weren't you?

01:03:14.693 --> 01:03:17.429
Your wife is in
prison, your children

01:03:17.529 --> 01:03:19.698
are living in Sweden, in
Stockholm with relatives,

01:03:19.798 --> 01:03:20.198
right?

01:03:26.638 --> 01:03:27.972
Is this a threat?

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.208
No.

01:03:30.308 --> 01:03:32.444
Not a threat.

01:03:32.544 --> 01:03:35.814
If they were to offer
the release of your wife

01:03:35.914 --> 01:03:37.348
as well as a handful
of other prisoners

01:03:37.449 --> 01:03:40.184
who have committed no
violence, would you consider

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:41.219
releasing the hostages?

01:03:44.923 --> 01:03:47.459
Handful of prisoners?

01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:49.160
10 or so.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.463
And this is not
an official offer.

01:03:51.563 --> 01:03:55.266
I would have to
convince the other side.

01:03:55.366 --> 01:03:58.002
And safe passage to
Venezuela for all of you.

01:03:58.102 --> 01:03:59.871
From Venezuela,
flights to Stockholm.

01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:01.139
Where I could see
my children again.

01:04:03.842 --> 01:04:08.480
Where you could see
your children again.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.815
I'm sure they're missing you.

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:12.884
I'm sure they're afraid for you.

01:04:12.984 --> 01:04:17.288
Won't you do this for them?

01:04:17.388 --> 01:04:20.258
All?

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:24.228
We must release all
political prisoners.

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:27.466
Please consider it.

01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:29.501
Do it quickly.

01:04:29.601 --> 01:04:32.403
I have considered.

01:04:32.504 --> 01:04:33.772
Wait.

01:04:33.872 --> 01:04:35.874
Let me walk you out.

01:04:35.974 --> 01:04:38.577
What were you talking about?

01:04:38.677 --> 01:04:40.211
I tried to make him an offer.

01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:41.345
And?

01:04:41.446 --> 01:04:43.915
Well, just let's wait and see.

01:04:44.015 --> 01:04:46.485
Well, are they going
to continue to negotiate?

01:04:46.585 --> 01:04:47.285
I don't know.

01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:48.319
They don't tell me anything.

01:04:48.419 --> 01:04:48.987
Please.

01:04:49.087 --> 01:04:49.788
I don't believe you.

01:04:49.888 --> 01:04:51.690
You have to know something.

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:53.157
I'm afraid this won't go on.

01:06:07.699 --> 01:06:08.733
Voila.

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:12.203
We start with the chicken
soup a la Roxanne.

01:06:12.303 --> 01:06:14.072
God.

01:06:47.105 --> 01:06:48.439
Bon appetit.

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:32.216
Carrot.

01:07:32.316 --> 01:07:32.951
Carrota.

01:07:33.051 --> 01:07:34.318
No... no s c mo se dice.

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:21.432
Gen?

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:22.399
Excuse me.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.805
Um, I wanted to ask
you for a favor.

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:29.841
Um, you know Carmen?

01:08:29.941 --> 01:08:31.042
Yes.

01:08:31.142 --> 01:08:35.113
Sometimes she sleeps
outside my room at night.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:38.850
Would you find her and... and ask
her not to sleep there tonight?

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.554
And then there's this
other thing that I

01:08:43.654 --> 01:08:48.292
want, but, um, I don't know.

01:08:48.392 --> 01:08:50.028
Maybe it's too much to ask.

01:15:28.659 --> 01:15:29.760
No, no, no, that's
too high for you.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.963
Uno m s pero... no, no,
no, come back, come back.

01:16:25.183 --> 01:16:27.218
Do you think I
could go outside?

01:16:27.318 --> 01:16:28.352
I'd like to talk to him.

01:16:37.295 --> 01:16:40.898
She says "I can ask."

01:18:13.591 --> 01:18:16.627
We are going outside.

01:18:26.003 --> 01:18:27.305
This is it.

01:18:27.405 --> 01:18:29.773
They are going to finish us.

01:18:29.873 --> 01:18:30.708
That's my last cigarette.

01:18:30.808 --> 01:18:31.942
I told you.

01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:32.476
Stop it.

01:19:00.604 --> 01:19:01.772
It's great.

01:19:01.872 --> 01:19:02.773
Great.

01:19:42.212 --> 01:19:42.613
Yah!

01:20:12.443 --> 01:20:13.944
Tell him that he sings well.

01:20:18.148 --> 01:20:20.217
He wants to know if
you think he's a fool.

01:20:20.317 --> 01:20:22.252
No, he's not... he's
not a fool for singing.

01:20:22.352 --> 01:20:24.287
You're an idiot for
going up in that tree.

01:20:24.388 --> 01:20:26.724
Tell him that a lot of the
best singers in the world

01:20:26.824 --> 01:20:29.126
are from Latin America.

01:20:34.798 --> 01:20:35.933
Come on, come on.

01:20:36.033 --> 01:20:36.600
Come on down.

01:20:38.969 --> 01:20:39.403
Ooh.

01:20:39.503 --> 01:20:40.337
Be careful.

01:20:44.374 --> 01:20:45.543
My god!

01:20:45.643 --> 01:20:46.977
I didn't mean for him to
throw himself out of the tree.

01:20:47.077 --> 01:20:48.011
Are you OK?
- Are you OK?

01:20:48.111 --> 01:20:48.679
You OK?

01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:53.083
You will teach him?

01:20:53.183 --> 01:20:55.052
Well, does he want to learn?

01:20:55.152 --> 01:20:58.889
Is he willing to work very, very
hard to see if he has a voice?

01:21:00.257 --> 01:21:02.192
S .

01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:50.007
Ay.

01:21:50.107 --> 01:21:50.508
Ishmael?

01:22:39.456 --> 01:22:40.357
MAN: Got it!

01:23:20.197 --> 01:23:22.566
I want to tell you that soon
they will not let me come here

01:23:22.666 --> 01:23:23.500
anymore.

01:23:23.601 --> 01:23:25.135
You are
losing your job.

01:23:25.235 --> 01:23:27.437
The government feels
they've put enough effort

01:23:27.537 --> 01:23:29.206
into negotiations.

01:23:29.306 --> 01:23:31.008
I have seen no effort at all.

01:23:31.108 --> 01:23:33.210
They have made us no
reasonable offers.

01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:35.178
Please, give it up.

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:36.479
Do it today.

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.548
Walk outside where everyone
can see you and surrender.

01:23:38.649 --> 01:23:39.983
What about our demands?

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.956
Have you spoken with
them in a similar way?

01:23:46.056 --> 01:23:47.691
Would they surrender?

01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:52.162
They will give up nothing.

01:23:52.262 --> 01:23:54.264
There's no chance no
matter how long you wait.

01:23:54.364 --> 01:23:55.799
Then we will
kill the hostages.

01:23:55.899 --> 01:24:00.337
No, you won't, because
you are not murderers.

01:24:00.437 --> 01:24:02.305
You must release these people.

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:02.806
Now.

01:24:07.144 --> 01:24:11.615
Why is it our responsibility
to make every concession?

01:24:11.715 --> 01:24:13.851
Are we expected to
give up because we

01:24:13.951 --> 01:24:16.654
have such a long history
of giving things up?

01:24:20.457 --> 01:24:22.192
500 fucking years.

01:24:27.898 --> 01:24:29.199
You don't think I miss my wife?

01:24:32.235 --> 01:24:32.770
My children?

01:24:36.306 --> 01:24:40.644
You think we have forgotten?

01:24:40.744 --> 01:24:47.985
You think this dream,
this horrible dream,

01:24:48.085 --> 01:24:48.686
makes me forget?

01:24:52.756 --> 01:24:53.957
I don't forget anything.

01:25:14.344 --> 01:25:18.648
If they keep us here
forever, we... we will manage.

01:25:18.749 --> 01:25:20.117
Keep us here forever?

01:25:20.217 --> 01:25:21.685
Are you insane?

01:25:21.785 --> 01:25:24.487
You were the brightest
one here once.

01:25:24.587 --> 01:25:26.323
Now you're as crazy
as the rest of them.

01:25:35.432 --> 01:25:38.568
How did your
negotiations go today?

01:25:38.668 --> 01:25:39.502
They went.

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:40.971
They went well.

01:25:45.408 --> 01:25:48.111
Please give it a
little more time.

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:50.413
We cannot afford to
lose any innocent lives.

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:52.615
Of course.

01:25:52.716 --> 01:25:55.018
The general would
like to talk to you.

01:25:55.118 --> 01:25:56.053
He's not at his usual location.

01:27:09.359 --> 01:27:10.693
Like this.

01:27:38.655 --> 01:27:39.456
No.
No.

01:27:41.658 --> 01:27:42.059
No.

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:42.692
No!

01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:47.030
No!

01:27:47.130 --> 01:27:48.999
Ishmael!

01:27:49.099 --> 01:27:49.532
Carmen!

01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:53.971
Carmen!

01:28:13.957 --> 01:28:15.358
Gilberto,!

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.241
No!

01:28:31.341 --> 01:28:32.342
No!

01:28:32.442 --> 01:28:32.842
Yo...

01:29:23.326 --> 01:29:24.227
Carmen!

01:29:28.331 --> 01:29:30.733
Carmen!

01:29:33.303 --> 01:29:35.705
Carmen!

01:29:36.806 --> 01:29:37.707
Carmen!

01:29:41.811 --> 01:29:42.712
Carmen!

01:29:42.812 --> 01:29:44.181
Carmen!

01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:44.681
Roxanne!

01:29:48.785 --> 01:29:49.686
No!

01:31:13.603 --> 01:31:15.004
Simon!

01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:21.010
Simon.

01:31:21.111 --> 01:31:22.011
Simon.

01:31:25.582 --> 01:31:27.484
It's OK.

01:31:32.089 --> 01:31:33.990
, presidente?

01:32:40.957 --> 01:32:41.824
It's time.
