The leaves we put over her wounds
stopped the bleeding,

00:59.768 --> 01:02.270

that's gonna last.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.688
We gotta do something.

Yaz, you gotta tell him.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.521
Tell me what?

14:17.022 --> 14:21.610
I've been having these… nightmares.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.780
That I'm alone, being hunted.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.490
-[Sammy] Oh.
-[exhales]

14:28.450 --> 14:32.371
When I told the others and found out
they've been having them, too,

14:32.454 --> 14:35.124
I… felt better.

14:35.207 --> 14:39.503
But I am, obviously,
not as fine as I thought.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.131
Everyone's having nightmares?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.632
Why didn't anyone tell me?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.467
It's not like that, Darius.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.721
We only just started talking about it
after we stopped to save Pierce

14:48.804 --> 14:52.600
and… missed the plane home.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.311
And we didn't want you to feel bad

14:55.394 --> 14:59.440
because we all agreed…
it was the right thing to do.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.816
Just like we're doing now.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.402
New plan.

15:03.485 --> 15:07.489
How about you go with Sammy and Ben
and I'll take the compound solo?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.366
Darius, are you sure?

15:09.450 --> 15:12.077
Yaz, I got this.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.204

blowing something up.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.942
