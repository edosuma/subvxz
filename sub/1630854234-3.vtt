00:01.871 --> 00:03.090
<i>Previously, on "Chucky"...</i>

00:03.133 --> 00:04.656
Sin is a choice.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.615
Hi, I'm Nadine.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.486
What the hell
is all this shit?

00:08.530 --> 00:11.011
- I steal things.
- Everyone's got their secrets.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.751
What's your secret?

00:12.795 --> 00:15.537
I'm Father Bryce, headmaster
at Incarnate Lord.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.496
They've had great success
with cases like this.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.672
<i>They could learn
from their mistakes.</i>

00:20.716 --> 00:22.152
Leave the door open if your
male friends are in your room.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.501
<i>Don't worry.</i>

00:23.545 --> 00:24.676
<i>We're all perfectly
safe here when it comes</i>

00:24.720 --> 00:25.547
<i>to Jake and Devon.</i>

00:25.590 --> 00:27.375
That's Trevor.
He's evil.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.159
The Lord brought you here
so I can finally

00:29.203 --> 00:30.856
make things right with you.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.816
<i>We received a new donation
this morning.</i>

00:33.859 --> 00:36.079
Boo!

00:36.123 --> 00:39.082
Oh, my God.
You made my day.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.692
- <i>
- What do we do?</i>

00:40.736 --> 00:43.130
- Let's just stand our ground.
- Can't let anyone else die.

00:44.783 --> 00:45.958
Now, where is the doll?

00:46.002 --> 00:47.003
I told you.
I don't know.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.048
What happened?
Did you get him?

00:48.091 --> 00:49.484
It's okay. She's cool.
She knows.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.228
<i>Why didn't you kill him?</i>

00:54.271 --> 00:55.664
Ever since he got here,
Chucky's been acting weird

00:55.707 --> 00:57.492
<i>and taking pictures
all over the school.</i>

00:57.535 --> 00:59.015
He's collecting
information for someone.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.147
Who?

01:00.190 --> 01:01.583
That's what
we're gonna find out.

01:03.454 --> 01:04.673
Where's the doll, Jake?

01:04.716 --> 01:07.719
I have no idea.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.417
You have no idea?

01:10.157 --> 01:12.985
Even though three days ago,
you were locked in this office

01:13.029 --> 01:14.117
alone with the doll,

01:14.161 --> 01:17.599
during which time
it went missing?

01:17.642 --> 01:20.167
Right.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.777
You know, it would
be easy to punish you.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.431
Have Trevor
and the hall monitors

01:23.474 --> 01:25.128
rip the place apart
until they find it,

01:25.172 --> 01:27.870
but I'm not gonna do that.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.741
- You're not?
- No.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.353
No, no, no, no, Jake.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.224
This is a learning opportunity.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.446
I want you to have the chance
to do the right thing,

01:38.489 --> 01:41.188
because I want you
to know how it feels,

01:41.231 --> 01:45.844
how free you are
to confess your sins,

01:45.888 --> 01:48.325
and pray for forgiveness.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.071
Lunch is almost over.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.638
I'm sure there's some place
you need to be.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.294
Thank you, Father.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.079
You've given me
a lot to think about.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.168
Jake...

02:05.212 --> 02:07.475
I want you
to choose the right path...

02:09.564 --> 02:12.958
but I'm not gonna wait long.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.438
Okay.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.981
- What did Bryce say?
- I don't know.

02:36.025 --> 02:38.723
A lot of patronizing bullshit.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.291
Look, he wants the doll back,
and he wants it fast.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.163
I don't like to be
without my dolls, either.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.645
Their tiny features
are very comforting.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.214
Okay, Lexy, did you
find anything out yet?

02:51.258 --> 02:54.391
Just a bunch
of weird selfies.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.350
The angles are all wrong.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.789
And a name.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.183
What name?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.010
The Colonel.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.360
That's it.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.493
Colonel Mustard?
Colonel Sanders?

03:09.537 --> 03:11.887
We gotta get
something out of him.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.194
What am I supposed to do?

03:14.933 --> 03:17.022
He hasn't talked in days.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.071
Don't you have his knife?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.521
What are you doing here?

03:37.565 --> 03:39.306
Why are you
taking pictures of us?

03:45.616 --> 03:47.531
Ha.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.623
If you won't talk,
we'll make you.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.454
Okay.
Let's do it.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.199
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:05.593 --> 04:08.160
Sick fuck.
He's enjoying it.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.510
We can't keep doing this.

04:09.553 --> 04:10.859
Just to kill him
before he kills us.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.643
Look, we need to
know what he knows.

04:12.687 --> 04:13.731
He's our best bet
at finding out

04:13.775 --> 04:15.385
what we're really up against.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.909
Here.
Let me try something.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.433
Okay.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.178
Last chance.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.745
How many of you are there?

04:27.789 --> 04:31.271
You know,
if you're gonna pull my hair,

04:31.314 --> 04:34.317
at least tell me I'm pretty.

04:53.597 --> 04:57.471
For centuries,
Western religious art

04:57.514 --> 04:59.821
was focused on one idea,

04:59.864 --> 05:04.608
directing our earthly human
attention toward the spiritual.

05:04.652 --> 05:08.308
So imagine how explosive
something like this

05:08.351 --> 05:11.441
must have been.

05:11.485 --> 05:14.662
Here, Dali challenges us
to imagine Christ

05:14.705 --> 05:17.142
as we've never dared,
from the perspective

05:17.186 --> 05:19.406
of God himself.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.713
Critics called this
painting a stunt,

05:22.757 --> 05:25.803
but perhaps Dali intended us
to do the unthinkable,

05:25.847 --> 05:29.372
really get inside
God's sorrow,

05:29.416 --> 05:31.853
his pain, his loss.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.858
We'll pick up tomorrow.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.993
Jake.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.605
So what'd you think
of that last one?

05:44.648 --> 05:46.824
Honestly, I've never
seen anything like it.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.523
Wait till you see
what I've got for you tomorrow.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.089
How's Devon?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.397
I heard he was sick.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.834
Oh, oh, yeah.

05:56.878 --> 05:59.228
It's just a cold.
I'm sure he'll be okay.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.403
Of course.

06:00.447 --> 06:05.103
But sometimes,
when we're overcome

06:05.147 --> 06:08.193
with guilt or sadness,

06:08.237 --> 06:10.326
we can make ourselves sick.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.329
And if that's ever the case,
I'm always here to talk.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.157
To Devon.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.028
To anyone,

06:17.072 --> 06:18.552
including you, Jake.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.686
You think
I'm overcome with guilt?

06:22.730 --> 06:25.820
I think something's
eating away at you.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.391
You wanna talk
about what happened

06:31.434 --> 06:33.480
to your foster brother?

06:34.959 --> 06:37.179
Um...

06:37.222 --> 06:39.703
there's more to it
than what everyone thinks.

06:43.141 --> 06:47.711
I don't think I'm ever gonna
be able to forgive myself.

06:47.755 --> 06:51.411
Jake, for what it's worth,

06:51.454 --> 06:54.501
in my experience,

06:54.544 --> 06:58.374
sometimes in order
to forgive ourselves,

06:58.418 --> 07:02.900
first we have to forgive those
who have sinned against us.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.473
Uh--okay.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.257
Yeah.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.520
Thank you.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.999
Yeah.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.915
See you tomorrow.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.652
Alexandra.
Hi, there.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.001
What's that?

08:01.655 --> 08:03.395
Allergies.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.442
I'm allergic to hay,
pet dander, and nosy people.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.270
That's funny.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.794
You know what else is funny?
- Rhetorical questions?

08:10.838 --> 08:12.753
Students can't keep
their own medicine.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.755
It's all locked up
in the infirmary.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.148
Yeah.
Hilarious.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.629
See you later.

08:23.938 --> 08:27.550
Ativan?
Clonazepam?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.247
I saw your mom's name
on the bottle.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.425
How is Mayor Cross by the way?

08:33.469 --> 08:35.863
- I wouldn't know.
- Right.

08:35.906 --> 08:39.083
Well, maybe I should call
her former Mayor Cross

08:39.127 --> 08:41.521
'cause she just lost
the election.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.612
- She lost?
- Uh, yeah.

08:45.655 --> 08:49.572
I was crushed
when I heard the news, too.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.836
You know, you should really
be more careful around here.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.535
This place is so strict
when it comes to drugs.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.842
If someone thought
you were using,

08:58.886 --> 09:02.672
well, you'd probably be stuck
in here until you turn 18

09:02.716 --> 09:04.239
just like me.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.112
Thanks for the warning.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.381
Have a blessed day.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
Eech, ugh.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.898
You didn't have
any clean socks?

09:56.639 --> 09:58.032
Don't worry.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.642
Won't be a problem
for you much longer.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.514
Ohh, I get it.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.256
Big man gonna do

10:05.300 --> 10:07.998
a wittle murder.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.350
You don't have what it takes.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.744
Zero killer instinct.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.529
And trust me, I should know.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.488
- Shut up, Chucky.
- No, really.

10:19.531 --> 10:23.144
I'm like the MVP
of serial murder.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.886
- Shut up.
- I've killed more people

10:25.929 --> 10:29.237
than you have Insta followers.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.066
Shut the fuck up.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.595
You think you think
you can fuck with me?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.771
I killed your mother.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.295
Hell, I even killed
my own mother.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.086
Wait!

10:52.129 --> 10:53.348
Devon, what are you doing?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.484
We need to talk.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.715
Father O'Malley.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.717
Hi.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.894
Oh, Lord, give me strength.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.723
Hello, Nadine.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.333
I'm really glad
you're in here.

11:22.377 --> 11:25.946
I kind of have a lot
to talk to you about.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.730
Crazy week.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.340
Wow.

11:29.384 --> 11:32.996
You know that old saying
when it rains, it pours?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.824
Well, it's funny,
'cause obviously sometimes

11:34.868 --> 11:36.957
it just sprinkles
a little, but--

11:37.000 --> 11:39.002
What is it you need, child?

11:39.046 --> 11:41.352
Oh, I need to confess.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.745
Oh, actually, Nadine,

11:42.789 --> 11:44.442
the confessional's closed
for the day.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.923
It is?
Oh, shoot.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.361
Um, I kind of have a lot
to go over with you.

11:50.405 --> 11:54.409
Um, shouldn't take more
than 20, 30 minutes, tops.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.629
Let's say 45.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.631
Oh, I would love to help,

11:59.675 --> 12:03.723
but I have to go elsewhere.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.550
Right now.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.944
Oh, that's no problem.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.512
I'll come back to tomorrow.

12:10.555 --> 12:14.298
Or maybe you could
pray on it instead.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.778
Yeah.

12:15.822 --> 12:19.129
Have a good long pray on it,
why don't you?

12:19.173 --> 12:22.872
But Father,
what about my sins?

12:22.916 --> 12:26.571
I need to confess.
I need to do penance.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.618
What about my soul?

12:29.661 --> 12:33.317
See you tomorrow, Nadine.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.670
<i>We should kill him
while we have the chance</i>

12:38.714 --> 12:40.324
before anyone else gets hurt.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.022
He's never gonna
tell us anything.

12:42.065 --> 12:45.155
If we can't figure out
his plan, we're sitting ducks.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.070
You can't torture a sadist.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.812
No, all right?
I'm not giving up.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.034
Look, it's not in his DNA.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.426
If he wanted to talk,

12:55.470 --> 12:57.559
you'd have to
completely reprogram him.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.650
Wait. Reprogram him--

13:01.693 --> 13:03.086
Like brainwashing?

13:03.130 --> 13:04.522
- Hm?
- Yeah, wait,

13:04.566 --> 13:06.916
let's try that.
- I wasn't being serious.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.439
You can't reprogram
Chucky's brain.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.267
Why not?
I mean, it might work,

13:10.311 --> 13:11.834
and I bet
you know how to do it, too,

13:11.878 --> 13:14.097
because you were super into
that one podcast on MKUltra.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.447
Uh, no, I wasn't.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.101
Okay, I'm gonna tell
Lexy and Nadine.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.234
We're starting tonight.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.556
Man, it took you guys
long enough.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.167
I brought everything
I could find.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.127
I wanted to make sure
Sister Ruth

13:44.171 --> 13:45.868
didn't catch us sneaking out.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.435
She's clenched tighter than--
- Okay.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.915
Well, you're here now.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.831
Oh.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.963
Okay.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.357
How was my day?

13:58.228 --> 14:01.231
Easily my lifetime
top five worst.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.407
Trevor is a total psycho--

14:06.584 --> 14:08.499
Never mind.
- Okay.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.546
So I know we're here
to plumb the depths

14:11.589 --> 14:15.245
of the human psyche, but I just
wanna say I'm really excited.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.944
I've never been to a sleepover
with boys before...

14:19.859 --> 14:21.295
or girls.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.994
This is crazy.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.344
How do we even know
if he can be broken?

14:27.388 --> 14:29.259
Look, if Chucky's
taught me anything,

14:29.303 --> 14:32.567
it's that anyone can be broken.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.482
Let's do it.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.750
All right.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.709
Stage one, sensory overload.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.677
Ahh!

14:59.550 --> 15:01.639
Pass the popcorn.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.048
These drops
will make him crazy.

15:21.094 --> 15:24.619
Hey, what's that?
What are you doing there?

15:24.662 --> 15:26.621
No. No.

15:26.664 --> 15:29.450
Not the drops!

16:18.238 --> 16:20.544
Oh, God. No more.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.983
It's working.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.028
Oh, it's gross.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.595
They call this aversion.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.597
The thought of violence is
actually making him sick now.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.816
So he's fixed?

16:31.860 --> 16:34.645
No, he's ready for stage two.

16:36.256 --> 16:39.085
Nadine, I think we
could use your help here.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.188
Aunt Maggie.

16:55.231 --> 17:00.410
Chucky wants to watch
the 9:00 news.

17:02.412 --> 17:05.415
- Boop.
- Not the unicorns!

17:05.459 --> 17:07.026
No!

17:07.069 --> 17:10.551
No, no, no, no.

17:19.429 --> 17:23.172
<i>♪ The sun shining
through my window ♪</i>

17:23.216 --> 17:26.436
<i>♪ Hop out of bed
and meet the day ♪</i>

17:47.588 --> 17:49.459
Ah.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.256
Hey.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.127
Hey, hey, guys. Devon.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.911
Guys, wake up. Come on.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.391
Wake up.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.002
Something's happening.
- Hey.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.787
I like to be hugged.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.572
Hi.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.574
I'm Chucky.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.967
Wanna play?

18:24.755 --> 18:27.193
Hi.
Who are you guys?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.151
I'm Chucky.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.674
Yeah, we know.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.372
Are you ready
to answer our questions?

18:32.415 --> 18:33.764
Sure.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.288
Why did you break
into the school?

18:35.331 --> 18:37.507
I don't know.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.423
How many Chuckys are there,
and what are you planning?

18:40.467 --> 18:43.339
I don't know,
and I don't know.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.648
Boy, I sure am sorry.

18:49.345 --> 18:52.740
We didn't brainwash him.
We brain bleached him.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.568
Well, maybe he
needs more time.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.222
I mean, it was a lot.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.875
Needs more time?
Listen to yourself.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.573
That's Chucky,
and he's playing us.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.923
This whole thing
is just an act.

19:09.017 --> 19:12.194
There.
That's better.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.804
Holy shit.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.937
Who untied him?

19:15.980 --> 19:20.071
Oh, the ropes came loose
during "My Little Pony,"

19:20.115 --> 19:22.248
but I didn't wanna
bother anyone.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.774
I'm hungry.

19:26.817 --> 19:31.648
Aww, it must be
from all the vomiting.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.607
You guys aren't
actually buying this.

19:33.650 --> 19:34.782
We're talking about
a knife-wielding,

19:34.825 --> 19:37.437
murder-happy sociopath.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.743
You know what?
I'm done.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.354
Devon, wait.
Come on.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.662
Okay, well, um,
I have to talk to him.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.621
Can you watch Chucky for me?

19:47.664 --> 19:50.363
No. Sorry, I can't.

19:50.406 --> 19:54.497
I have to go do something.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.543
I can watch him.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.632
I'm a really good babysitter.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.286
Oh, no, Nadine.

20:00.329 --> 20:04.855
No need to worry about me.
I took four years of Krav Maga.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.902
Plus I got this bitchin' knife.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.122
Who are you?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.171
Um, we'll be right back.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.955
I'm gonna get Chucky
something to eat.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.662
Devon, can you please
just talk to me?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.838
There's nothing
to talk about.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.450
The only safe Chucky
is one that's been killed,

20:34.494 --> 20:36.670
cut into pieces, and burned.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.280
Even that's not a sure thing.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.891
If you keep him around,
someone's gonna end up dead.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.503
What if we
really changed him?

20:43.546 --> 20:45.026
What if he could help us?

20:45.069 --> 20:46.854
What if he kills you, Jake?

20:46.897 --> 20:48.377
What am I supposed to do then?

20:48.421 --> 20:52.294
Devon, look, I need this.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.124
I need to try
and do it a different way.

20:56.167 --> 21:00.824
'Cause all I feel is guilt...

21:00.868 --> 21:03.262
all the time,

21:03.305 --> 21:08.005
and I don't know
how much more I can take.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.878
If I really want
to forgive myself,

21:10.921 --> 21:14.098
I have to be able
to forgive him first.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.667
This is a mistake.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.234
I can't lie to you.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.062
I can't tell you this is right.

21:21.105 --> 21:25.414
Just promise me...

21:25.458 --> 21:29.766
for now that you won't do
anything to Chucky, okay?

21:32.421 --> 21:33.988
I promise.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.340
Thank you.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.521
Oh, Sister Ruth. Hi.

22:28.564 --> 22:32.742
Um, do you know
when the nurse will be back?

22:32.786 --> 22:34.222
I am the nurse.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.791
You?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.706
Right, for sure.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.664
Don't look
so surprised, Ms. Cross.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.884
I also teach auto.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.494
Okay.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.627
I just have a headache.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.933
Do you think I could
bother you for an aspirin?

22:51.239 --> 22:52.980
I don't see why not.

22:54.851 --> 22:58.377
Nursing was a natural
vocation for me.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.033
I have an excellent
bedside manner.

23:13.783 --> 23:17.004
- Alexandra.
- Still Lexy.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.354
Just thinking about
our talk from yesterday.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.052
Really?
I'm doing my best to forget it.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.489
It's just
I'm so worried about you.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.360
First I find out
you have a drug problem,

23:25.404 --> 23:28.319
and now you're
scoping out the infirmary.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.104
What do you want, Trevor?

23:30.147 --> 23:32.454
I just wanna help you.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.631
I've learned so much in here
thanks to you and your mom.

23:35.675 --> 23:39.200
Learned that if you wanna
survive in a place like this,

23:39.243 --> 23:41.202
you have to put your faith
in a higher power.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.944
Thanks, but no thanks.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.859
Not really in the market for--

23:45.902 --> 23:48.078
I'm your higher power.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.385
And if you don't learn
that quickly,

23:50.429 --> 23:53.388
I'll make this place
a living hell for you, too.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.086
Listen...

23:56.130 --> 23:59.046
I'm sorry for my part
in sending you here.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.876
I've been a bully, too.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.356
I know what it feels
like to go around

24:05.400 --> 24:11.145
fucked up on anger
and insecurity and fear

24:11.188 --> 24:13.582
and then take it out
on everyone else.

24:15.889 --> 24:19.283
But I'm not like
that anymore,

24:19.327 --> 24:21.111
and you don't have
to be either.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.811
Now who's preaching?

24:24.854 --> 24:26.769
Don't do this.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.075
I own you now.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.642
You think this place is bad?

24:29.685 --> 24:32.949
You fuck up, and I'll show
you how much worse it can get.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.910
Go to class.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.652
No, Trevor, I don't know
where you can get condoms.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.959
Trevor Cain!

24:46.006 --> 24:47.834
Nice try,

24:47.877 --> 24:49.575
but if it makes you
feel any better,

24:49.618 --> 24:53.056
my situation here
couldn't possibly get worse.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.094
Mr. Evans,

25:31.138 --> 25:32.792
I thought you were sick.

25:38.885 --> 25:41.757
You shouldn't be out of bed
if that's the case.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.846
Maybe it's just
something I ate.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.979
The food here's a little--

25:46.022 --> 25:47.328
Yeah, maybe.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.329
You're right, though.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.896
I should get back to bed.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.289
Or maybe the feeling
isn't biological.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.161
Maybe it's more philosophical.

25:56.337 --> 25:59.122
- What?
- Guilt.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.821
It has a funny way
of manifesting in us.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.520
Uh, I don't think so.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.522
You sure about that?

26:07.566 --> 26:09.480
Because sometimes
the actions of others

26:09.524 --> 26:11.831
weigh heavy on our souls.

26:14.224 --> 26:15.835
Come with me to the chapel.

26:18.011 --> 26:21.275
Mr. Evans, fix the tie
and tuck in the shirt.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.717
After my mom died,

26:28.761 --> 26:30.850
my dad got me my cat,
Mr. Pasta,

26:30.893 --> 26:32.503
so I'd be less lonely.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.636
I really miss him.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.682
Only child here.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.641
He really is like
the brother I never had.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.816
He's really cuddly,

26:40.860 --> 26:43.558
but he also likes
his alone time.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.168
And I respect that boundary.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.561
Wow.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.782
Mr. Pasta sounds
genuinely cool.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.784
So cool.

26:57.485 --> 26:58.878
Okay.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.141
Here you go, buddy.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.762
OMG!

27:13.806 --> 27:15.155
Calm down, Nadine.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.244
It's Chucky,
not One Direction.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.724
Mmm!

27:18.767 --> 27:21.248
This is so crisp.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.949
Okay, that was kinda cute.

27:26.993 --> 27:30.213
Hey, uh, where's Devon?

27:30.257 --> 27:31.432
You don't know?

27:34.522 --> 27:36.480
Don't look at me.

27:36.524 --> 27:39.658
Last I saw him, you were
following him out the door.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.660
He never came back.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.794
Relax, Jake.
I'm sure your boyfriend

27:45.838 --> 27:48.318
will grace us
with his presence soon.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.842
I gotta go to class soon.

27:49.885 --> 27:50.973
Do you think you could just

27:51.017 --> 27:53.584
watch Chucky again for me, please?

27:53.628 --> 27:55.935
I can't. I also have class.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.806
But I promise I can later.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.288
Lexi?

28:02.681 --> 28:04.987
No. What?

28:05.031 --> 28:06.815
- Come on, please.
- No.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.513
So about later,

28:09.557 --> 28:10.863
what's the plan, here?

28:10.906 --> 28:13.169
Father Bryce said
that if we don't have the doll

28:13.213 --> 28:15.084
back on his desk
by the end of the day,

28:15.128 --> 28:17.391
then there's going
to be trouble.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.915
I only say that
'cause I'm supposed to stop

28:19.959 --> 28:21.134
getting in trouble.
- Yeah, well,

28:21.177 --> 28:23.353
Father Bryce can screw himself.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.746
Oh, my.

28:24.790 --> 28:28.576
This is fun.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.839
Okay, please, Lexy.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.798
Look, we're in this together,
aren't we?

28:36.323 --> 28:38.934
Yes, okay, fine.
Just go away.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.544
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.242
Yeah. I'm aware.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.330
All right,
I'll see you in an hour.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.767
Hidey-ho.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.782
Devon?

29:00.826 --> 29:02.305
Wait, what are you doing?

29:02.349 --> 29:03.785
Father Bryce sentenced me
to hard labor

29:03.829 --> 29:05.265
till Chucky's returned.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.833
What? That's bullshit.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.356
You're telling me.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.754
Well, you're gonna
need a mani after this.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.757
Are you really that blind?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.236
What?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.935
You're not the only one
going through hell, Jake.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.240
And every minute
you keep Chucky around

29:24.284 --> 29:26.112
is another minute
we have to suffer.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.420
Look, I'm sorry.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.292
I'm gonna fix this.

29:32.335 --> 29:33.859
I promise.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.906
All right?

29:43.564 --> 29:45.827
Where do dolls come from?

29:45.871 --> 29:48.090
That's a good question.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.440
No idea where you keep
coming from.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.008
What's your favorite class?

29:53.052 --> 29:54.793
- Napping.
- How did you get your hair

29:54.836 --> 29:56.838
so shiny?
- Leave-in conditioner.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.709
Do you have a cat?

29:58.753 --> 30:00.929
Absolutely not.

30:00.973 --> 30:03.453
Do you have a boyfriend?

30:07.893 --> 30:11.200
I did have a boyfriend.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.028
Once.

30:15.030 --> 30:18.033
Was he nice?
What was his name?

30:21.297 --> 30:22.777
Junior.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.302
He was the sweetest.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.699
Junior.
I like that name.

30:31.742 --> 30:34.397
♪ Junior, Junior, Junior

30:34.441 --> 30:36.747
♪ Junior, Junior

30:36.791 --> 30:39.750
♪ Junior, Junior, Junior

30:39.794 --> 30:41.404
♪ Junior, Junior

30:43.667 --> 30:45.756
Where are you going?

30:58.073 --> 31:00.771
What brings you
to Him today, child?

31:00.815 --> 31:02.817
My roommate, her name's Lexy.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.602
Nadine, please,
stick to the process.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.169
Right.
Sorry.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.910
Bless me Father
for I have sinned.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.434
It's been three days
since my last confession.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.393
Anyway, Lexy's awesome,

31:13.436 --> 31:16.613
but I think
she's addicted to drugs.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.006
Actually, I know it.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.792
My mom was an addict,
and I recognize the signs,

31:21.836 --> 31:24.970
and this time
I won't ignore them.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.450
Is that all?

31:27.494 --> 31:29.409
Lexy's so cool.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
Her hair is so shiny.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.587
Have you seen it?
It's hard to miss.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.937
Trevor is still the worst.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.592
I know I'm not supposed
to wish ill on people,

31:38.635 --> 31:42.857
but I wouldn't hate it if he <i></i>

31:42.901 --> 31:45.991
had to sneeze every time
he had cereal,

31:46.034 --> 31:49.733
and Cheerios
just flew out of his mouth.

31:49.777 --> 31:52.258
Are you putting
God first, child?

31:52.301 --> 31:54.129
Maybe if you focused on--
- Hold on.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.043
I don't wanna lose
my train of thought.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.305
Oh!

31:56.349 --> 31:57.828
And there's
this doll, Chucky.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.613
He's alive. I don't know.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.528
How can a doll be alive?

32:01.571 --> 32:03.747
The whole idea
kinda violates everything

32:03.791 --> 32:06.011
I believe in, right?

32:06.054 --> 32:08.839
Mm, yes. Right.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.668
Maybe not actually.

32:11.712 --> 32:14.149
I don't know, if I believe
in the Father and the Son

32:14.193 --> 32:15.977
and the Holy Ghost,
it's not that crazy

32:16.021 --> 32:17.544
to think that there
are other spirits

32:17.587 --> 32:19.981
just hanging out

32:20.025 --> 32:22.853
in dolls, right?

32:28.903 --> 32:30.949
Father O'Malley?

32:31.601 --> 32:33.125
You okay?

32:35.040 --> 32:37.042
Yes, my child.

32:37.085 --> 32:40.001
Ah, well, I think that's it.

32:40.045 --> 32:43.135
For these and all my sins,
I am sorry

32:43.178 --> 32:45.789
and ask for God's forgiveness.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.967
Okay. Sure.
Why not?

32:49.924 --> 32:51.708
So what's my penance?

32:51.752 --> 32:55.408
Ah, 400 Hail Marys.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.366
400?

32:57.410 --> 32:59.238
Seems harsh,

32:59.281 --> 33:01.414
but you're the expert
on redemption.

33:01.457 --> 33:04.721
Yes.
Yes, I am, my child.

33:41.671 --> 33:42.672
Hail, Mary, full of grace.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.022
The Lord is with thee.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.024
Blessed art thou
among women and blessed

33:46.067 --> 33:47.982

of thy womb, Jesus.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.898
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

33:50.941 --> 33:52.465
now and at the hour

33:52.508 --> 33:53.683
Hey, Sister.

33:55.337 --> 33:58.862
Hail, Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.560
Blessed art thou among
women and blessed

34:00.603 --> 34:02.083
is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.651
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners--

34:06.740 --> 34:10.091
<i>♪ Let Christ forgive

34:10.135 --> 34:12.485

34:24.845 --> 34:30.111

34:32.766 --> 34:35.899
Hail, Mary, full of grace,

Blessed art thou among
women and blessed

34:38.641 --> 34:40.861
is the fruit

34:40.904 --> 34:44.386
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

35:14.503 --> 35:16.288
the Lord is with thee.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.074

Amen.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.053
Lexy?

35:44.925 --> 35:46.622
Chucky?

35:57.720 --> 36:00.201
Do you have a problem with
my decision, Sister Catherine?

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
I just think
punishing an innocent kid

36:02.247 --> 36:03.900
sends the wrong message.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.992
What message would you send?

36:09.036 --> 36:11.734
That anything
and everything is tolerated?

36:15.608 --> 36:18.306
Did you know
about Jake and Devon?

36:18.350 --> 36:19.699
What do you mean?

36:19.742 --> 36:21.309
You know exactly what I mean.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.615
Do I?

36:24.269 --> 36:26.923
- Yes, you do.
- You can't do this to Devon.

36:30.753 --> 36:34.757
Jake, good to see you, too.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.194
Students aren't really
allowed back here.

36:36.237 --> 36:39.240
- Yeah, sure.
- Ah, yes. Great job.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.069
Why don't we go to my office?

36:42.112 --> 36:43.679
We can talk about
what's bothering you there.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.333
I have some scriptures
that are highlighted.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.074
Don't do that.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.902
Devon has done nothing wrong.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.599
He has nothing to do with this.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.561
Our sins often hurt
the people around us

36:55.604 --> 36:57.215
more than they hurt us.

36:59.956 --> 37:01.915
Sister Catherine
knows all about that.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.232
Lexy?

37:23.328 --> 37:25.199
Lexy?

37:32.293 --> 37:34.252
Do you wanna talk

37:34.295 --> 37:36.341
or not talk about it?

37:49.484 --> 37:51.312
Oh, no, Lexy.

37:57.753 --> 38:00.408
It's not just this bad day.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.326
It's a lot of bad days,

38:05.370 --> 38:08.721
and I'm doing my best

38:08.764 --> 38:10.766
to keep it all together
because that's

38:10.810 --> 38:13.943
what's expected of me.

38:13.987 --> 38:18.644
Cool, chill, funny,

38:18.687 --> 38:21.299
exceptionally good looking,

38:21.342 --> 38:23.344
well-dressed Lexy.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.307
But inside...

38:33.746 --> 38:35.922
inside I'm drowning.

38:38.054 --> 38:41.928
Everything is up to here,
and I'm doing my best

38:41.971 --> 38:44.060
to stay afloat,
but it's impossible.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.977
And I hate
when Jake and Devon fight...

38:50.545 --> 38:54.941
And I hate that my mom
can't just be normal,

38:54.984 --> 38:58.553
and I hate Trevor
and his dumbass face,

38:58.597 --> 39:00.990
and, oh,
I fucking hate that doll!

39:14.047 --> 39:17.093
I'm sorry about today.

39:18.921 --> 39:21.663
I wish all days could be great.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.361
It sucks that they can't.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.800
It's not realistic.

39:27.843 --> 39:33.022
And I know I can't really
fix anything.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.112
That's also not realistic...

39:36.156 --> 39:39.289
but I can be your friend.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.468
And good friends
can make it through anything.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.866
And now you're stuck with me.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.436
Wanna get outta here?

39:57.133 --> 39:59.222
I have a stash
of Oreos in our room,

39:59.266 --> 40:02.312
and no one can be sad
while eating Oreos.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.099
Yeah.

40:06.142 --> 40:09.798
Can we just hang here
for a bit longer?

40:11.583 --> 40:13.889
I don't really wanna
face the world yet.

40:54.713 --> 40:59.369
Oh, good job, Mr. Evans.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.849
Sure.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.070
You're free to go.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.682
I hope you learned
a valuable lesson today.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.510
What do you mean?

41:09.554 --> 41:11.730
Jake returned the doll.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.645
- He did?
- Yeah, sure did.

41:13.688 --> 41:17.736
So the doll, it's in
your office, and he's alone?

41:17.779 --> 41:19.128
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.653
Leave it alone, Mr. Evans.

41:41.281 --> 41:44.023
Lexy?
Nadine?

41:44.066 --> 41:46.416
Is anyone in there?

42:23.976 --> 42:26.979
See you forever, Alexandra.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.043
Gah!

42:57.183 --> 42:59.794
No! No, no, no, no, no, no,
please!

42:59.838 --> 43:01.970
Please, please, please!

43:07.410 --> 43:08.934
You see?

43:08.977 --> 43:11.719
Oh, I never skip arm day.

43:39.704 --> 43:41.183
Oh, my God.

43:41.227 --> 43:43.490
Oh, dear sweet God

43:43.533 --> 43:45.579
mother of hail Mary Jesus.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.102
Fuck!

43:48.277 --> 43:50.018
Ohh.

43:58.244 --> 44:00.942
Where is Chucky?
Did you give him to Bryce?

44:00.986 --> 44:03.205
No, no.
I left him with Lexy.

44:03.249 --> 44:05.512
You took your eyes
off a killer doll?

44:05.555 --> 44:08.297
I locked the door so he
couldn't get out.

44:08.341 --> 44:10.473
Didn't I?

44:10.517 --> 44:13.259
Shit. I didn't realize
he'd be so wily.

44:13.302 --> 44:15.565
What are the rules
for brainwashed Chucky?

44:15.609 --> 44:16.958
There are no rules.

44:17.002 --> 44:18.046
I feel like
this friend group

44:18.090 --> 44:20.135
just needs
to communicate better.

44:20.179 --> 44:22.442
Look, Bryce said
Chucky was in his office.

44:22.485 --> 44:23.704
He clearly walked
out of our room,

44:23.748 --> 44:25.140
killed Trevor,
and went downstairs

44:25.184 --> 44:26.141
to keep fucking with us.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.708
Why was Trevor in here?

44:27.752 --> 44:29.710
How do we know
if this was Chucky, anyways?

44:29.754 --> 44:31.190
Who else would do this?

44:31.233 --> 44:32.408
I would say Trevor,
but you're currently

44:32.452 --> 44:33.671
standing in a puddle of him.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.324
Inspection!

44:36.761 --> 44:39.285
No running, ladies.

44:39.328 --> 44:40.939
Inspection!

44:43.550 --> 44:45.030
Oh, no.

44:45.073 --> 44:46.509
Inspection.

44:46.553 --> 44:47.902
Oh, God.

44:47.946 --> 44:49.904
First these uniforms.
Now inspections?

44:49.948 --> 44:51.471
Come on.
We've gotta hide him.

44:51.514 --> 44:53.081
Okay.

45:01.220 --> 45:06.529
Um, you're not
supposed to be here!

45:15.713 --> 45:17.192
Okay.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.588
Inspection.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.375
Headache?

45:26.419 --> 45:28.203
All better.

45:28.247 --> 45:30.423
Hm.

45:30.466 --> 45:34.035
Sister Ruth, you know
the other day in health class

45:34.079 --> 45:35.733
when we were talking
about that one thing?

45:35.776 --> 45:37.647
Which day?

45:37.691 --> 45:40.868
Uh, it might have been
last month, actually.

45:40.912 --> 45:44.350
Uh, anyways, it really
got me spiraling.

45:44.393 --> 45:47.048
Do you think that flesh-eating
diseases are a real threat?

45:47.092 --> 45:48.180
I really like
jumping in puddles,

45:48.223 --> 45:49.703
but now
all I can think about is

45:49.747 --> 45:50.922
bacteria wanting to nibble me.

45:50.965 --> 45:52.575
Sister Ruth,
I really need to know.

45:52.619 --> 45:53.751
And, oh, my gosh.

45:53.794 --> 45:56.188
What about
brain-eating amoebas?

45:59.452 --> 46:01.323
All good in here, girls

46:11.072 --> 46:12.160
Wait, where are you going?

46:12.204 --> 46:13.945
Away from this.

46:17.209 --> 46:18.819
Devon, come on.

46:21.126 --> 46:22.692
Oh, my God.
