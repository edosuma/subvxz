01:55.320 --> 01:58.420
<i>By the end of
our nation's great Civil War,</i>

01:58.455 --> 02:00.851
<i>thousands of children
found themselves orphaned.</i>

02:02.426 --> 02:05.229
<i>Their fathers killed in battle,</i>

02:05.264 --> 02:08.298
<i>their mothers taken
by disease, or grief.</i>

02:11.930 --> 02:14.700
<i>Many ended up
on the Orphan Train,</i>

02:14.735 --> 02:17.505
<i>a program to relocate children</i>

02:17.540 --> 02:20.541
<i>from the decimated
northern cities</i>

02:20.576 --> 02:22.576
<i>to families
in other territories.</i>

02:24.910 --> 02:26.613
<i>Families with love to give.</i>

02:28.518 --> 02:29.518
<i>And farms to run.</i>

02:34.722 --> 02:39.362
<i>My brother, sister and I
rode the Orphan Train,</i>

02:39.397 --> 02:42.629
<i>cold, hungry, and scared.</i>

02:42.664 --> 02:44.862
<i>Little did we know at the time</i>

02:44.897 --> 02:47.568
<i>that the only thing
stronger than death</i>

02:47.603 --> 02:49.603
<i>was our father's love
for his children.</i>

02:55.281 --> 02:56.313
- I'll miss you, Daddy.

02:56.348 --> 02:57.380
- I'll miss you too.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.012
This is a doll.

03:03.047 --> 03:04.816
For both you girls.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.884
That's gonna protect you
while I'm gone.

03:08.327 --> 03:10.492
And anytime you miss Daddy,

03:10.527 --> 03:13.528
you can hold that doll
when you go to sleep at night,

03:13.563 --> 03:16.333
and know that I'm always
thinkin' about you.

03:17.336 --> 03:19.303
- Okay?

03:19.338 --> 03:21.305
Come here, Lily.

03:21.340 --> 03:23.901
Oh, I love you.

03:23.936 --> 03:25.672
<i>When Father
started talking about</i>

03:25.707 --> 03:28.312
<i>leaving for the war,</i>

03:28.347 --> 03:31.447
<i>our oldest brother, Phillip,
was determined to go with him.</i>

03:32.747 --> 03:35.979
- Charlie, you're
the man of the house now.

03:37.752 --> 03:40.753
<i>Father told him
to stay and look after us,</i>

03:40.788 --> 03:42.590
<i>but eventually relented.</i>

03:48.532 --> 03:50.026
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:54.406 --> 03:55.966
- I'll be home soon.

04:54.092 --> 04:55.366
Phillip!

04:58.899 --> 05:00.569
Phillip!

05:06.478 --> 05:07.576
- Father.

05:07.611 --> 05:08.973
- Where are you hurt?

05:09.008 --> 05:10.711
I can't feel my legs.

05:10.746 --> 05:12.108
- Come on, I got you.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.683
Get in the back.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.064
Get him to safety;
get him to safety.

05:23.693 --> 05:24.693
Lieutenant!

05:25.695 --> 05:26.991
Get him down here.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.124
Get him down.

05:28.159 --> 05:31.061
Move down.

05:31.096 --> 05:33.668
They're comin', they're comin'.

05:33.703 --> 05:34.746
- Move in!
There's more of 'em comin',

05:34.770 --> 05:36.000
there's more of 'em comin'.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.672
- I'm fine.
I can go back.

05:37.707 --> 05:38.640
- No, you're not goin' back.
- I can go back.

05:38.675 --> 05:39.806
- You can't go back!

05:39.841 --> 05:41.610
Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.688
- I can't leave them, Father.
- Stay with me.

05:42.712 --> 05:44.910
- I love you.
- No! Father, no!

05:44.945 --> 05:46.780
- Father, no!
- Stay with me.

05:46.815 --> 05:48.078
Stay with me.
- No!

05:48.113 --> 05:49.750
- Corporal, stay with me.

07:04.629 --> 07:05.793
- All aboard!

07:09.832 --> 07:11.568
- Thank you.

07:12.802 --> 07:14.571
- Let's get
these children on the train.

07:14.606 --> 07:16.166
We leave in five minutes.

07:24.682 --> 07:28.519
<i>Mother got word that
Father had died in battle.</i>

07:28.554 --> 07:30.015
<i>It was like part of her broke.</i>

07:32.250 --> 07:33.821
<i>Like she had a hole inside.</i>

07:35.224 --> 07:40.696
<i>Before too long, tuberculosis
came and aimed to fill it.</i>

07:44.834 --> 07:45.834
Watch your step.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.122
<i>Riding on that train, though,</i>

08:11.157 --> 08:12.860
<i>we felt a little less lonely.</i>

08:14.897 --> 08:17.601
<i>Next to the rest
of the orphan children,</i>

08:17.636 --> 08:19.328
<i>we considered ourselves lucky.</i>

08:20.837 --> 08:23.299
<i>At least we had each other,</i>

08:23.334 --> 08:25.103
<i>least we were still
part of a family.</i>

08:34.851 --> 08:36.653
- So, how'd you end up
on this Orphan Train?

08:38.349 --> 08:44.121
- My father, he didn't
come back from the war.

08:44.157 --> 08:48.093
And. and my mother,
she recently died.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.637
So, we're gonna live
with my brother, Phil.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.021
Order!

09:15.056 --> 09:16.056
Arms!

09:29.301 --> 09:31.235
Manhood comes sooner for some.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.712
Why don't you follow me down
to the Children's Aid Society.

09:35.747 --> 09:37.813
We told them you were alive,

09:37.848 --> 09:39.782
and I think your siblings
should be here soon.

09:47.055 --> 09:48.285
Take care.
- Yes, sir.

09:49.695 --> 09:50.775
- Son, you'll be all right.

09:52.390 --> 09:53.730
Carry on.

09:55.932 --> 09:57.294
Thank you.

09:57.329 --> 09:59.230
- Um-hmm.

10:01.707 --> 10:03.307
- Corporal, the Army
is movin' your post.

10:05.106 --> 10:06.347
There's a lot of folks
moving out west

10:06.371 --> 10:08.074
and they wanna
relocate your post

10:08.109 --> 10:10.373
to one along the Bozeman Trail.

10:10.408 --> 10:12.848
Government's gonna
give you land, aid,

10:12.883 --> 10:13.783
so you can build a home
on the river

10:13.818 --> 10:14.982
just outside of Bozeman.

10:15.017 --> 10:16.819
- Hmm.

10:16.854 --> 10:17.963
- Son, that's a lot to take in.

10:17.987 --> 10:19.382
You understand what I'm sayin'?

10:21.122 --> 10:22.297
I think this could be
a real good start

10:22.321 --> 10:24.090
for you and your family.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.862
- Yes, sir. I do.
My apologies.

10:28.162 --> 10:29.425
- It'll be a good beginning.

10:31.099 --> 10:32.868
- I hope it is.
Thank you.

10:38.106 --> 10:39.820
- There's a couple of
angry tribes out there, son.

10:39.844 --> 10:42.471
And I can't blame 'em.

10:42.506 --> 10:44.748
Settlements have moved west
rather quickly

10:44.783 --> 10:47.146
and things have gotten messy.

10:47.181 --> 10:50.314
We need good soldiers
like yourself to.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.349
Help bring some peace.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.022
Okay.

12:08.559 --> 12:10.394
- Just give me a minute
to gather myself.

12:12.134 --> 12:13.331
- Oh, I...

12:13.366 --> 12:14.937
- And then we can go upstairs.

12:14.972 --> 12:15.872
- I don't. I don't want
anything from you.

12:15.907 --> 12:16.907
I just.

12:18.602 --> 12:20.305
Uh, I like to.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.175
I'd like to buy this lady
a drink.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.018
Are you, uh, you all right?

12:35.553 --> 12:36.827
- Yes.

12:43.165 --> 12:44.835
You can come in.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.484
Um.

13:07.519 --> 13:10.058
Four years ago, I had to put
my baby on the Orphan Train.

13:11.655 --> 13:13.325
Just wonder what she's like now.

13:15.626 --> 13:18.033
I want her bed to be ready
just in case she does come back.

13:22.039 --> 13:24.842
- We can talk about it if...
If you'd like to.

13:28.309 --> 13:29.583
- Ain't no man ever wanted to
stay up all night

13:29.607 --> 13:31.376
and talk to me.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.185
- What was, uh.
What's your daughter's name?

13:42.158 --> 13:43.256
- Gretyl.

13:45.062 --> 13:46.391
I named her after my mother.

13:48.362 --> 13:49.405
I wanted her to have
a better life

13:49.429 --> 13:50.429
than I could give her.

13:51.629 --> 13:53.233
What will you do
now the war's over?

13:56.073 --> 13:59.668
- Um. I.

13:59.703 --> 14:02.341
I lost. both my parents.

14:02.376 --> 14:05.641
So, I have to be taking care
of my little siblings now.

14:08.514 --> 14:13.517
The Army's relocated me up to
Montana, so.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.255
- Your siblings,
what's their names?

14:17.358 --> 14:19.897
- So, my younger brother,
his name is Charlie.

14:21.131 --> 14:23.428
And, uh, so proud
of that little guy.

14:25.069 --> 14:27.003
He's.

14:27.038 --> 14:30.699
He's gonna be a big man
someday, you know.

14:30.734 --> 14:32.943
Reminds me a lot of my father.

14:32.978 --> 14:37.310
And, uh,
gosh. Lizzy.

14:37.345 --> 14:38.410
A little ball of fire.

14:40.183 --> 14:44.383
And then Lily, kind of afraid
that she won't remember me.

14:47.718 --> 14:50.224
And the thing that I can't
stop thinkin' about is

14:50.259 --> 14:51.357
how am I gonna.

14:53.526 --> 15:01.526
How am I gonna break it to them,
you know, Father, he's gone.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.402
And it's just gonna be me.

15:05.274 --> 15:07.010
And how am I gonna be him?

15:12.281 --> 15:14.314
- Um, maybe I could walk you

15:14.349 --> 15:17.383
to the train station
tomorrow, Mister...

15:17.418 --> 15:18.681
What's your name again?

15:18.716 --> 15:22.223
- Uh, Phillip.
Phillip Calgrove.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.622
- Thank you for just
wanting to talk to me.

15:25.657 --> 15:28.361
- Yeah. You're welcome.

16:45.110 --> 16:47.308
What's the matter, sweetheart?

16:47.343 --> 16:49.772
- I miss my mom and dad.

16:49.807 --> 16:51.114
I'm so sorry.

16:53.151 --> 16:55.283
- Why does God
let bad things happen?

16:57.683 --> 16:58.858
- I don't
have any answer to that,

16:58.882 --> 17:00.585
but we have to have faith.

17:03.788 --> 17:05.194
I want you to try to
get some sleep.

17:05.229 --> 17:06.756
It's a long train ride.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.132
- My mom
would always sing me to sleep.

17:13.864 --> 17:21.144
<i>- ♪ O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder ♪</i>

17:21.179 --> 17:27.117
<i>♪ Consider all the works
Thy Hands hath made ♪</i>

17:27.152 --> 17:33.882
<i>♪ I see the stars
I hear the roaring thunder ♪</i>

17:33.917 --> 17:40.724
<i>♪ Thy powers throughout
The universe displayed ♪</i>

17:40.759 --> 17:47.170
<i>♪ Then sings my soul,

17:47.205 --> 17:51.207
<i>♪ How great Thou art ♪</i>

17:51.242 --> 17:55.178
<i>♪ How great Thou art ♪</i>

18:09.293 --> 18:11.854
- Come on. Get up.

18:11.889 --> 18:12.889
War's over.

18:36.881 --> 18:40.487
Move, boy!

18:54.965 --> 18:56.536
- Keep walkin'.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.217
- Come on.

19:09.419 --> 19:10.913
Go on, get.

19:13.654 --> 19:14.884
- Keep walkin', Desmond.

19:14.919 --> 19:16.754
- Keep walking. Go.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.329
- Don't look back.

19:42.353 --> 19:43.385
- Come on, Desmond.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.382
Whoa.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.912
Jack Calgrove.

20:17.652 --> 20:18.652
- Samuel Hagan.

20:20.457 --> 20:21.737
Boys look like you had it rough.

20:22.756 --> 20:23.756
- Yeah.

20:27.090 --> 20:28.397
- Desmond Richards.

20:28.432 --> 20:29.596
- Samuel Hagan.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.470
- I got these horses here.

20:35.505 --> 20:38.902
Strays I picked up
off the battlefield.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.409
How you boys gettin' home?

20:54.887 --> 20:55.887
- Molly!

20:59.727 --> 21:01.056
Charlie!

21:04.699 --> 21:05.830
I'm home!

21:08.835 --> 21:09.835
Molly?

21:12.608 --> 21:13.904
Nobody's home.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.510
- Everything all right,
Mr. Calgrove?

21:19.483 --> 21:20.779
- Molly!

21:38.128 --> 21:39.567
Whoa, whoa.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.680
Molly.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.394
They think I'm dead.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.667
I gotta find my children.

22:18.036 --> 22:22.038
Gentlemen,
allow me to welcome you home

22:22.073 --> 22:24.480
on behalf of our great nation,

22:24.515 --> 22:28.781
and know that
while you have lost comrades,

22:28.816 --> 22:32.950
brothers, and friends,
that it was not in vain.

22:35.119 --> 22:37.053
That your nation thanks you.

22:41.565 --> 22:42.861
Well, I'll be damned.

22:46.801 --> 22:49.439
Company, present arms!

22:57.779 --> 23:01.814
- Several days after
Molly had heard of your death,

23:01.849 --> 23:03.519
she passed, Jack.

23:06.216 --> 23:07.952
Tuberculosis.

23:10.792 --> 23:12.495
I'm sorry.

23:12.530 --> 23:16.697
Molly's wish was
that the young ones

23:16.732 --> 23:19.535
be sent to live with
your son Phillip in Missouri.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.935
- Phil is still alive?

23:26.137 --> 23:27.906
- Yes.

23:27.941 --> 23:29.446
- Thank you, God.

23:30.944 --> 23:34.242
Who's been tendin' to Charlie,

23:34.277 --> 23:35.947
Lizzy, and Lily?

23:35.982 --> 23:39.082
- The Army contacted
an orphanage in New York.

23:39.117 --> 23:42.184
A gentleman by the name
of Edward Pagan.

23:42.219 --> 23:45.495
He's doin' many fine works,

23:45.530 --> 23:47.255
placing children
with good homes.

23:47.290 --> 23:49.059
The Orphan Train movement.

23:50.799 --> 23:52.964
- You mean to tell me,

23:52.999 --> 23:56.231
you put my children
in an orphanage?

23:56.266 --> 23:59.773
- Jack, when I found out
Phillip was still alive,

23:59.808 --> 24:02.809
I needed to get those children
to Missouri to meet him.

24:02.844 --> 24:05.042
There's 50 kids on that train.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.714
It seemed to me to be

24:06.749 --> 24:09.079
the most reasonable option
to transport them.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.916
- Oh, help me God.

24:10.951 --> 24:14.689
You put my kids on a train,
you sent them to Missouri?

24:14.724 --> 24:17.659
You realize how dangerous
that is?!

24:17.694 --> 24:20.288
That's hostile territory!

24:20.323 --> 24:22.026
We just finished
fightin' the war

24:22.061 --> 24:24.061
right where that train's goin'!

24:24.096 --> 24:25.997
Are there armed officers
on that train?

24:26.032 --> 24:28.263
- Yes, Jack.

24:28.298 --> 24:30.903
The government has ordered
that Company K

24:30.938 --> 24:34.577
ride with the Orphan Trains
to guard them against

24:34.612 --> 24:36.271
hostile Confederates
and Natives.

24:36.306 --> 24:39.175
- Company K's a group
of sharpshootin' Natives

24:39.210 --> 24:40.781
from Michigan.

24:40.816 --> 24:42.277
I was in the 54th Regiment

24:42.312 --> 24:44.884
and I did some work
with Company K.

24:44.919 --> 24:49.790
- Jack, I can send
a message through Company K

24:49.825 --> 24:54.630
alerting your son Phillip
that you're still alive.

24:54.665 --> 24:56.825
- I reckon you point me
in the direction of that train.

25:05.269 --> 25:07.808
God bless your soul.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.825
- All packed up.

25:26.697 --> 25:29.126
- You know you don't
have to go with me.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.864
You might enjoy
some peace and quiet.

25:30.899 --> 25:32.602
- Yeah.

25:32.637 --> 25:34.329
I ain't got nowhere else
I got to be.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.905
And I want to help you
get your family back.

25:41.646 --> 25:43.272
- You're a good man.

25:43.307 --> 25:44.307
Let's get on the trail.

25:57.024 --> 25:58.024
Let's ride.

27:10.966 --> 27:12.801
- Charlie, I'm hungry.

27:12.836 --> 27:14.869
- Okay, um, wait right here.

27:20.041 --> 27:22.140
- Um, excuse me.
Would it be okay

27:22.175 --> 27:24.780
if I get a few more
pieces of bread and water?

27:24.815 --> 27:26.342
- Yes, dear. Um.

27:26.377 --> 27:27.827
I'll go ahead and distribute
the bread to everyone.

27:27.851 --> 27:28.851
- Thank you.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.823
- What happened to you?

27:34.858 --> 27:36.825
Mom not want you anymore?

27:36.860 --> 27:38.959
Or she just work at
one of them whorehouses?

27:47.167 --> 27:48.331
- Here, you come sit with us.

27:50.808 --> 27:52.335
- Charlie, you good?
- Yeah.

28:03.381 --> 28:04.314
- Some bread for you.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.052
- Thank you.

28:08.793 --> 28:10.089
- Here.

28:46.930 --> 28:47.896
- Good morning to you all!

28:47.931 --> 28:49.491
- Good morning.

28:49.526 --> 28:52.230
- Beautiful day
for some new families.

28:52.265 --> 28:57.433
Fathers mothers, brothers,
and sisters.

28:57.468 --> 28:59.941
Thank you for comin'.

28:59.976 --> 29:01.943
- We've arrived
in Independence, Missouri,

29:01.978 --> 29:03.912
and you're all about to go home.

29:03.947 --> 29:05.848
Please stay seated
for right now,

29:05.883 --> 29:07.960
and Mr. Smith will be right on
to tell you where to go next.

29:07.984 --> 29:09.819
- You'll have to
fill out the paperwork

29:09.854 --> 29:11.150
for this gentleman.

29:11.185 --> 29:13.185
It's required by law.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.286
Those of you who've already
filled out the paperwork

29:15.321 --> 29:18.190
can just step to the front
of the line over there.

29:18.225 --> 29:20.093
We'll bring out the children.

29:20.128 --> 29:21.028
I need some strong boys
for helping me.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.293
- It's gonna be okay.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.426
Oh, we got strong ones and...

29:23.461 --> 29:24.933
And strong girls too.

29:24.968 --> 29:26.363
Do they have names?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.167
Oh yeah, they all have names.

29:39.048 --> 29:41.114
Everyone, get off the train.

29:51.027 --> 29:52.554
Follow me and we'll form a line.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.833
- Watch your step.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.199
Step right down.

30:00.234 --> 30:01.234
There you go.

30:04.502 --> 30:06.139
There you go, Jimmy.

30:06.174 --> 30:08.174
There we go.

30:08.209 --> 30:10.044
Please form a line at the stand.

30:10.079 --> 30:12.640
There we go, little one.

30:12.675 --> 30:14.246
Got it, young lady?

30:14.281 --> 30:15.511
There you go.

30:15.546 --> 30:16.512
Phil!

30:16.547 --> 30:18.217
Lizzy!

30:18.252 --> 30:19.252
- Phil!

30:20.353 --> 30:21.353
- It's okay.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
- Watch your step.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.458
- Hey, buddy.

30:28.493 --> 30:32.033
Oh, my gosh.
Look how big you've grown.

30:32.068 --> 30:34.068
- Dang.

30:34.103 --> 30:38.336
- Hey. Hey, uh, Lily, I...
I know you may not remember me.

30:38.371 --> 30:41.306
Uh, but I'm your older brother,
Phil.

30:41.341 --> 30:43.209
I'm gonna take care of you.
Okay?

30:43.244 --> 30:45.178
- She hasn't talked
since Mother and Father died.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.249
- Okay.

30:50.284 --> 30:51.558
That's all your stuff
right there?

30:51.582 --> 30:53.450
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll get that...

30:53.485 --> 30:55.232
- Sir, you will need, uh, to
fill out the proper paperwork.

30:55.256 --> 30:57.157
- Okay. All right,
you guys get in line.

30:57.192 --> 30:58.192
I'll be right back.

30:58.226 --> 30:59.226
- Okay.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.235
Ingrid?

31:09.270 --> 31:12.073
- All right, parents,
step up to the front.

31:12.108 --> 31:13.668
We'll need your paperwork.

31:13.703 --> 31:15.175
Come on up.
Come on up.

31:15.210 --> 31:16.176
Don't be afraid.

31:16.211 --> 31:17.914
Thank you.

31:23.152 --> 31:24.712
This way, please.

31:37.232 --> 31:38.232
- Uh-uh.

31:40.598 --> 31:42.037
- Step this way.

31:42.072 --> 31:43.302
Thank you.

31:43.337 --> 31:44.337
Thank you, sir.

31:46.010 --> 31:47.141
This way, please.

31:49.343 --> 31:50.309
- Paperwork looks good to me.

31:50.344 --> 31:51.344
- Next group.

31:53.314 --> 31:54.247
- What's your name?

31:54.282 --> 31:55.545
- Emily.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.086
- Hi, Emily.
Welcome to our family.

31:58.121 --> 32:00.154
- Next.

32:00.189 --> 32:02.552
- In our house,
you earn your keep.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.192
You work hard, get rewarded
with a good supper.

32:05.227 --> 32:08.129
If you don't work hard,
you hit the road.

32:08.164 --> 32:10.362
In this house, I'm the law.
That understood?

32:10.397 --> 32:12.001
- Yes, sir.

32:12.036 --> 32:12.727
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

32:12.762 --> 32:15.004
- All right. Come on.

32:15.039 --> 32:16.665
Come on down this way.
Right around.

32:16.700 --> 32:19.008
Come on now. Come on.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.444
- For Charlie, Lizzy,
and Lily Calgrove, please.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.777
That's my brother, Phil.

32:29.812 --> 32:33.550
Phil, can we take Mary with us?

32:33.585 --> 32:35.354
- I'm so... I'm sorry, children.

32:35.389 --> 32:39.127
I have, uh, Addison, Mary,
Johnny, Ray and Jacob down

32:39.162 --> 32:41.756
as all getting adopted
by the Smith family and they...

32:41.791 --> 32:43.560
They've not shown up yet.

32:43.595 --> 32:47.102
If they don't show up
by tomorrow morning,

32:47.137 --> 32:48.664
you'll go back on the train.

32:48.699 --> 32:50.710
But... but tonight you'll sleep
in the local orphanage.

32:50.734 --> 32:54.208
- Wait, what about Jimmy?

32:54.243 --> 32:57.541
- Uh. well, the family
didn't take Jimmy.

32:57.576 --> 33:01.479
Uh, lots of times, they don't
take the older children.

33:05.551 --> 33:06.649
- Bye.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.453
- My dad gave me this doll.

33:08.488 --> 33:09.751
I'd like you to have it.

33:12.459 --> 33:13.459
- Bye.

33:15.264 --> 33:17.660
- All right, uh,
Lily, Lizzy, Charlie,

33:17.695 --> 33:20.168
it's time to get goin'.

33:20.203 --> 33:24.106
Here. I got this for ya.

33:24.141 --> 33:25.272
Go on, sweetheart.

33:27.177 --> 33:28.374
- Bye.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.153
You're one brave cowboy.

33:38.188 --> 33:41.057
And sometimes, cowboys have to
part ways to their cattle.

33:46.757 --> 33:48.460
- All right, bud.

34:29.469 --> 34:31.338
- I beg you, please help me.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.636
My daughter has been taken.

34:33.936 --> 34:35.110
Please.

34:36.344 --> 34:38.213
- You lost?

34:38.248 --> 34:40.643
Ain't much around here but men
returnin' home from the war.

34:42.516 --> 34:46.452
And for a Black woman,
it ain't a safe place to be.

34:54.924 --> 34:56.594
There's a town.

34:58.235 --> 35:00.367
About 25 miles back
the way we came.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.550
- Thank you.
- I'm sure there's someone

35:07.574 --> 35:08.574
there can help you.

35:25.559 --> 35:26.559
- Keep the guns down.

35:28.298 --> 35:29.704
- Looks like we got a couple of
no-good Yanks.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.464
- Yankees.

35:33.237 --> 35:35.402
- War's over.
You guys keep on movin'.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.272
- Over when we say it's over.

35:37.307 --> 35:39.439
- How 'bout I just rip you
off that horse?

35:45.546 --> 35:46.546
- Keep goin'.

35:54.654 --> 35:56.324
- We gotta keep moving.

35:56.359 --> 35:58.479
I want to rip their throats out
just as bad as you do.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.557
- One more step, she's done!

36:34.595 --> 36:35.759
She's done!

36:40.502 --> 36:41.633
One more step...!

36:52.547 --> 36:53.777
- Come with us.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.530
Your daughter.

37:10.565 --> 37:14.765
Was in an alley living
out of a cardboard box.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.932
You gave us no choice
but to remove her.

37:18.738 --> 37:21.607
Don't you tell me that!

37:23.842 --> 37:26.480
You don't know what I've
been through to find freedom!

37:28.077 --> 37:29.945
Now to have my child
ripped away!

37:31.685 --> 37:33.949
You tell me what
my child is right now!

37:33.984 --> 37:35.291
Right now!

37:38.120 --> 37:39.790
Please, I beg you, sir.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.825
I beg you, please.
She ain't ever been without me.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.475
I'm a good mother. I promise,
I'm a good mother.

37:43.499 --> 37:46.401
I promise.

37:46.436 --> 37:47.930
I'm a good mom.

37:53.542 --> 37:54.542
- Forgive me.

37:56.413 --> 37:57.893
Now, let's see
what we can do for you.

38:01.616 --> 38:03.979
Looks like Mary is on a train
heading to Missouri

38:04.014 --> 38:05.519
with about 40 other children.

38:08.425 --> 38:11.723
She will be at the orphanage,
in good care.

38:25.002 --> 38:26.882
- You sure your daughter's
on that Orphan Train?

38:43.658 --> 38:46.593
I lost two years of my life
in those Confederate camps.

38:49.466 --> 38:52.126
My babies' voices echoed
through my head every day.

38:56.605 --> 38:57.901
It's what kept me from dyin'.

39:03.777 --> 39:04.875
How old is your daughter?

39:07.011 --> 39:08.450
- She's 10.

39:09.585 --> 39:10.683
- You said her name was?

39:10.718 --> 39:11.783
- Mary.
- Mary?

39:11.818 --> 39:13.015
- Mary Beggs.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.654
- Mary.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.902
- Where are you headed off to?

39:35.171 --> 39:37.479
Told you that you can't
get emotionally involved

39:37.514 --> 39:39.745
with these men who come in here.

39:39.780 --> 39:41.450
They aren't safe.

39:54.190 --> 39:55.926
- I never wanted this life.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.060
- Do you think
any of us want this life?

40:00.636 --> 40:02.933
I hate myself for bringing you
here with me and Jimmy.

40:04.673 --> 40:07.641
When he died, I thought
I could work here

40:07.676 --> 40:10.204
until I found another man or...

40:10.239 --> 40:14.010
Or got me an honest job
to take care of you.

40:14.045 --> 40:19.048
I never intended to drag you
into this dark hole with me.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.556
- We can leave in the morning.

40:21.591 --> 40:22.722
And never look back.

40:24.528 --> 40:26.154
I met an honest soldier.

40:26.189 --> 40:27.573
He ain't your normal man.
He just wanted to talk to me.

40:27.597 --> 40:29.597
- Ingrid, you little fool.

40:29.632 --> 40:31.093
Where do you think
this honest man

40:31.128 --> 40:33.194
is goin' to take you?

40:33.229 --> 40:34.602
What do you think
is gonna happen?

40:34.637 --> 40:35.637
I'm leaving!

40:38.542 --> 40:41.070
I would rather die
a gruesome death

40:41.105 --> 40:44.612
than spend one more night here
havin' a man touch me.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.485
I remember
when we was little girls.

40:51.951 --> 40:53.258
We used to run through
the sunflower fields

40:53.282 --> 40:54.886
in North Carolina.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.692
You used to tell me
that dreams are from God.

41:00.663 --> 41:04.533
And that when you stop dreaming,
you stop living.

41:07.197 --> 41:09.065
Sarah, we aren't living.

41:12.972 --> 41:14.510
- Dreams aren't real.

41:15.810 --> 41:17.612
I ain't too sure God is real.

41:19.814 --> 41:22.012
But I ain't goin' to stop you
from leavin' here.

41:54.981 --> 41:56.343
- There you go.

41:56.378 --> 41:58.180
Lily, this is yours.

41:58.215 --> 41:59.852
And Charlie.
- Thank you.

41:59.887 --> 42:01.755
- There you go.
- Ooo, muffins are my favorite.

42:01.790 --> 42:05.924
- And last, but certainly
not least, Miss Lizzy.

42:05.959 --> 42:07.794
- Thank you.

42:07.829 --> 42:09.323
- You're welcome.

42:11.965 --> 42:17.837
So, I got some news. The Army
is relocating me up to Montana.

42:17.872 --> 42:21.302
That means that we're going to
be leaving tomorrow morning.

42:21.337 --> 42:24.679
I think it will be
a good start for all of us.

42:24.714 --> 42:26.142
- What will we do up there?

42:26.177 --> 42:28.276
- The Army has given me
some land by a river.

42:28.311 --> 42:30.619
And, um.

42:30.654 --> 42:32.247
I plan on turning it
into a farm.

42:32.282 --> 42:34.755
So, we'll be raising crops,
and we'll have horses

42:34.790 --> 42:36.383
and we'll have sheep and cattle.

42:36.418 --> 42:38.187
And there's even a town.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.892
And in that town,
there's a little school

42:39.927 --> 42:41.322
that I'll take you all to.

42:41.357 --> 42:43.291
- Oh, can I fish on the river?

42:43.326 --> 42:44.930
I used to love fishing
with Father.

42:44.965 --> 42:46.294
You can fish all you want.

42:46.329 --> 42:48.868
- Yeah. As a family.

42:48.903 --> 42:50.837
- Yeah.
But I caught the most fish.

43:00.442 --> 43:02.717
- Did you see Father die?

43:07.724 --> 43:09.350
- No.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.000
- Hi.

43:22.035 --> 43:24.167
- Uh, hi.

43:24.202 --> 43:25.872
Uh, come in, come in.

43:28.338 --> 43:30.877
- Hi. I'm Lizzy.

43:30.912 --> 43:33.374
- Hello, Lizzy.
Nice to meet you. I'm Ingrid.

43:33.409 --> 43:34.409
Hi, Charlie.

43:34.443 --> 43:35.443
Hello, Lily.

43:38.887 --> 43:40.647
- Um, here. Let me give you
somethin' to eat.

43:43.353 --> 43:45.254
- The three of you
sure look alike.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.696
- Uh, Charlie,
Lily, and Lizzy, uh,

43:47.731 --> 43:49.863
Ingrid is a. a friend of mine.

43:53.902 --> 43:57.365
- Um.
Can I come with you to Montana?

43:57.400 --> 43:59.807
I won't be any trouble.
I just.

43:59.842 --> 44:01.138
I want a better life.

44:03.505 --> 44:05.780
- I think it would be
nice for her to come with us.

44:07.784 --> 44:12.820
- Yeah. Um, I...
I suppose, yeah.

44:14.219 --> 44:15.790
- Thank you.

44:15.825 --> 44:17.484
- Ingrid, do you think
you can talk Phil

44:17.519 --> 44:21.059
into letting our friends
come with us to Montana?

44:21.094 --> 44:22.863
I don't think
they have any homes.

44:22.898 --> 44:24.799
- Um, they made friends
with other children

44:24.834 --> 44:26.295
on the Orphan Train,

44:26.330 --> 44:30.167
and they didn't get
adopted this morning.

44:30.202 --> 44:31.872
But you know what?

44:31.907 --> 44:33.478
I know you had a long day
today on the trains.

44:33.502 --> 44:35.018
And we're gonna have
a very long day tomorrow,

44:35.042 --> 44:36.503
'cause if we're
gonna be traveling,

44:36.538 --> 44:38.274
we're gonna have to pack up.

44:38.309 --> 44:40.507
So, I think it's time
for you guys to get to bed.

44:40.542 --> 44:43.015
- I can make a pallet
for them by the fireplace.

44:43.050 --> 44:44.412
- Oh.
- Lizzy and Lily,

44:44.447 --> 44:45.897
how about I braid your hair
before bed?

44:45.921 --> 44:47.217
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44:47.252 --> 44:48.856
- Okay.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.176
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:18.211 --> 46:19.211
Go, go, go, go.

46:38.968 --> 46:40.363
Jack, there're too many!

46:51.112 --> 46:52.342
Jack, there's Company K!

47:08.591 --> 47:09.711
Thanks for the help, soldier.

47:17.567 --> 47:18.567
Let's move out.

47:21.307 --> 47:23.043
There may be more comin'.

47:23.078 --> 47:24.275
Come on.

47:35.486 --> 47:38.652
We've been tracking
these Apaches for a while now.

47:38.687 --> 47:39.961
- Lieutenant Calgrove.

47:39.996 --> 47:41.160
- Shantu.

47:41.195 --> 47:43.525
United States Army, Company K.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.505
- Ah, you're the Native Union
sharpshooting group.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.364
- Yes, sir.

47:47.399 --> 47:48.662
Wait a minute.

47:48.697 --> 47:50.939
Calgrove.

47:50.974 --> 47:52.534
The letter, please.

47:52.569 --> 47:54.239
What letter?

47:54.274 --> 47:55.449
You're the father
coming for his children.

47:55.473 --> 47:57.044
Here's a letter we're delivering

47:57.079 --> 47:58.650
to the station
in Independence, Missouri.

47:58.674 --> 48:00.377
But why didn't it get there?

48:00.412 --> 48:02.247
We guard
these Orphan Trains at night.

48:02.282 --> 48:03.622
We'll pull over
to pick on those Apaches

48:03.646 --> 48:05.316
you just encountered.

48:05.351 --> 48:08.088
And it took us far off track.

48:08.123 --> 48:11.619
- My son, Phillip Calgrove,
lives in Independence, Missouri.

48:11.654 --> 48:13.456
That's where he's stationed.

48:13.491 --> 48:15.271
They're supposed to be
holding them with him there.

48:15.295 --> 48:16.624
How far is it?

48:16.659 --> 48:18.527
- It's about
a hundred miles from here.

48:18.562 --> 48:19.562
- Let's move.

48:38.516 --> 48:40.252
- The kids are still sleeping.

48:40.287 --> 48:41.418
- Mornin'.

48:44.324 --> 48:45.587
All, uh, all loaded up now.

48:51.562 --> 48:52.562
- Is everything okay?

49:14.618 --> 49:16.552
We don't.
We don't know each other,

49:16.587 --> 49:20.391
but what I do know is
we seem to be

49:20.426 --> 49:22.492
in the same place in our lives.

49:25.497 --> 49:27.200
We're both searching
for a greater purpose.

49:36.475 --> 49:37.475
I just.

49:38.774 --> 49:41.181
I just can't walk in there
and adopt six children.

49:46.716 --> 49:48.188
I can barely
take care of myself.

49:52.821 --> 49:54.590
I had stopped
believing in goodness.

49:56.363 --> 49:57.626
Until the night we met.

50:01.764 --> 50:03.599
From that night on, I.

50:05.273 --> 50:07.570
I started thinking maybe
there's another way for me.

50:11.510 --> 50:14.412
Maybe with these children, I.

50:18.781 --> 50:20.451
I could be worth something.

50:23.555 --> 50:24.653
I can help you.

50:29.561 --> 50:30.626
We can do it.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.719
- Mary, Addi,
Johnny, Jacob, Ray, Jimmy,

50:57.754 --> 50:59.259
get out here!

51:00.394 --> 51:01.525
Get out here!

51:02.891 --> 51:03.891
Lizzy!

51:05.366 --> 51:07.564
I miss you.

51:07.599 --> 51:10.237
- Jacob.
- I miss you so much.

51:10.272 --> 51:11.272
Jimmy!

51:13.836 --> 51:16.177
- Well.

51:16.212 --> 51:18.641
Your brother already
sendin' you back, huh?

51:18.676 --> 51:20.280
No, sir.

51:20.315 --> 51:22.447
We would like to take
our friends with us.

51:22.482 --> 51:25.351
- I'd, uh, like to formally
adopt all these children

51:25.386 --> 51:26.319
that were left behind.

51:26.354 --> 51:27.452
- You serious, sir?

51:27.487 --> 51:28.487
- Dead serious.

51:28.521 --> 51:30.884
- Whoo!

51:30.919 --> 51:34.195
- We could use your help on
the farm from all of you guys.

51:34.230 --> 51:37.396
Well, you'll all be glad

51:37.431 --> 51:39.893
to have a family again, right?

51:39.928 --> 51:41.631
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

51:41.666 --> 51:43.897
- I'll get the paperwork
and you can be on your way.

51:43.932 --> 51:45.800
- Okay, thank you.
- All of ya.

51:45.835 --> 51:47.604
Thank you.

51:47.639 --> 51:49.177
Ray, welcome to the family.

51:49.212 --> 51:51.179
I'm Phil.

51:51.214 --> 51:52.741
What's your name?
- Mary.

51:52.776 --> 51:53.776
- I'm Phil.

51:57.319 --> 51:58.813
Goodbye, Frank.

51:58.848 --> 52:00.419
- I'll miss you, Ray.

52:00.454 --> 52:01.454
- I'll miss you too.

52:02.984 --> 52:04.159
- Goodbye, Jimmy.

52:06.988 --> 52:08.427
Good luck to ya.

52:08.462 --> 52:09.494
Hope to see you again.

52:09.529 --> 52:10.529
- Thank you.

52:11.531 --> 52:12.531
God bless.

52:14.468 --> 52:15.468
All right, everyone.

52:27.778 --> 52:30.944
<i>We met up with
another family leaving town,</i>

52:30.979 --> 52:34.255
<i>and together, we set out
to start our lives over.</i>

52:42.430 --> 52:44.958
<i>Huddled in the back
of those wagons,</i>

52:44.993 --> 52:47.499
<i>we were ready
to take on the world.</i>

53:03.319 --> 53:04.362
- Charlie, why don't you
get up here

53:04.386 --> 53:05.466
and show 'em how it's done.

53:10.425 --> 53:12.359
Right over there.
- Okay.

53:12.394 --> 53:13.723
On your sights.

53:13.758 --> 53:14.758
Sit back, everybody.

53:18.367 --> 53:19.367
Ooh.

53:19.401 --> 53:20.961
- Dang, Charlie.

53:20.996 --> 53:23.370
- Yeah, Charlie.
- Bull's eye, buddy.

53:23.405 --> 53:25.306
Doesn't surprise me
at all, buddy.

53:26.375 --> 53:27.375
Who's next?

53:27.409 --> 53:28.409
- Can I go next?

53:28.443 --> 53:29.640
- Yeah, get up here.

53:29.675 --> 53:31.312
All right,
just like your brother,

53:31.347 --> 53:32.808
right at those tin cans
I set up.

53:32.843 --> 53:33.843
Okay.

53:34.945 --> 53:37.351
Now, it's a little loud,
so I'm gonna cover your ears.

53:37.386 --> 53:39.749
All right.
Line up a little bit.

53:39.784 --> 53:41.586
You got it?

53:42.655 --> 53:44.391
Ooh.

53:44.426 --> 53:45.524
- Nice shooting, cowgirl.

53:45.559 --> 53:46.723
- Thanks.

53:46.758 --> 53:48.527
- Dang, Lizzy, you can shoot.

53:48.562 --> 53:50.628
- I'll go. That's easy.

53:50.663 --> 53:52.762
Hit that one right there.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.368
Here you go.

53:54.403 --> 53:56.931
Now just like the other two,
line it up.

53:56.966 --> 53:58.286
Now let her rip
when you're ready.

53:59.408 --> 54:00.682
Which one of these
is the trigger?

54:00.706 --> 54:02.409
- Whoa.
- Hey.

54:02.444 --> 54:04.840
All right, so first
rule of handling a gun is,

54:04.875 --> 54:06.842
you never aim at another person.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.580
Only if
it's the bad guy, though.

54:08.615 --> 54:10.615
- Thank you, Charlie.
Only if it's the bad guy.

54:10.650 --> 54:12.320
Children, supper's ready.

54:12.355 --> 54:13.816
- All right,
we'll do this later.

54:13.851 --> 54:14.949
Come on, Jimmy.

54:19.791 --> 54:21.461
<i>As we traveled West,</i>

54:21.496 --> 54:23.727
<i>our hearts began to heal</i>

54:23.762 --> 54:25.960
<i>from the wound
of losing our parents.</i>

54:29.801 --> 54:32.802
<i>We let go of our fear and anger.</i>

54:32.837 --> 54:34.705
<i>Love re-entered our lives.</i>

55:24.119 --> 55:25.657
- Corporal.

55:25.692 --> 55:27.054
Welcome to Missouri, Lieutenant.

55:27.089 --> 55:28.495
- Looking for
the local orphanage.

55:28.530 --> 55:30.464
Can you point us
in that direction?

55:30.499 --> 55:32.565
- Down that way
at the edge of town.

55:32.600 --> 55:33.600
- Thank you.

55:39.101 --> 55:41.068
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:50.112 --> 55:51.518
I'm here for my children.

55:51.553 --> 55:53.146
- Oh, yes, sir.

55:53.181 --> 55:56.083
Well, I will need for you
to fill out the necessary...

55:56.118 --> 55:58.459
I don't think you understand!

55:58.494 --> 56:00.428
My children arrived here
a few days ago.

56:00.463 --> 56:01.627
Phillip Calgrove.

56:01.662 --> 56:03.024
- Phillip Calgrove, yes.

56:03.059 --> 56:04.531
A... And the children.

56:04.566 --> 56:06.093
They're... they're with him.

56:06.128 --> 56:07.534
- Where the hell are they?

56:07.569 --> 56:08.997
- They're...
They're on a wagon train

56:09.032 --> 56:10.471
on the way to the Oregon Trail.

56:10.506 --> 56:11.934
It's West.
- Tell me! You got a map?

56:11.969 --> 56:13.067
You got a map in here?

56:13.102 --> 56:14.970
- I have many maps. I.

56:15.005 --> 56:16.136
I'm sure you can find it.

56:21.946 --> 56:24.111
- Was there a child named
Mary Beggs with them?

56:24.146 --> 56:27.785
- Mary Beggs, Mary Beggs.

56:27.820 --> 56:29.457
- Lieutenant, Lieutenant.

56:29.492 --> 56:31.217
You cannot travel that alone.

56:31.252 --> 56:32.658
- You know the route?

56:32.693 --> 56:33.725
- Sure do.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.056
- We'll all ride together.

56:35.091 --> 56:36.761
- Mary's, yes, yes, yes,
she's with them.

56:36.796 --> 56:38.059
Yes, yes. I remember Mary.

56:38.094 --> 56:39.094
She's with them.

56:39.128 --> 56:40.633
You'll need this paper.

56:40.668 --> 56:41.865
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

56:41.900 --> 56:42.932
- Thank you.
- Yes.

56:46.168 --> 56:48.575
- Phil's been assigned
to a new post.

56:48.610 --> 56:49.930
Someone must have
given the order.

56:53.208 --> 56:54.493
<i>Looks like you folks
left one war,</i>

56:54.517 --> 56:55.846
jumped right into another one.

56:55.881 --> 56:56.913
Where are they?

56:57.982 --> 56:59.113
- Here.

56:59.148 --> 57:01.148
Bozeman, Montana.

57:01.183 --> 57:03.084
See, a lot of these tribes
were forced West,

57:03.119 --> 57:06.890
and they had their land
seized by the government.

57:06.925 --> 57:11.026
They blamed the settlers and
started raiding the whole area.

57:11.061 --> 57:12.962
We had to station men
at different posts

57:12.997 --> 57:14.799
to help keep the peace.

57:14.834 --> 57:16.031
- Are the children in danger?

57:19.872 --> 57:21.113
- Well, the Cheyenne
have been causing

57:21.137 --> 57:22.169
most of the trouble.

58:15.356 --> 58:16.531
Charlie, get the girls.

58:22.198 --> 58:23.131
Come on, come on.

58:23.166 --> 58:24.198
This way.

58:24.233 --> 58:25.837
Come on, come on you guys.

59:16.890 --> 59:18.285
- We don't want any trouble.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.023
We're just passing through.

59:22.159 --> 59:24.357
On our way to Montana to farm.

59:24.392 --> 59:27.932
Here, come, break bread with us.

59:27.967 --> 59:28.967
- Hmm.

59:29.001 --> 59:31.034
- Okay, yeah. Okay.

59:31.069 --> 59:34.004
Guys, let's break bread.

59:34.039 --> 59:35.039
It'll be okay.

59:42.883 --> 59:45.015
- No!

59:49.857 --> 59:50.857
- Get down.

59:52.959 --> 59:54.123
- Please, please no more.

59:56.457 --> 59:58.292
Please, please.

59:58.327 --> 59:59.327
Please, enough.

01:00:00.802 --> 01:00:01.802
Stop!

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:03.903
No!

01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.268
- Please, please, no more.

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.072
They're just children.

01:00:09.107 --> 01:00:10.304
They're children, no!

01:00:16.983 --> 01:00:17.983
- No!

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.320
- No!

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.025
Charlie, no!

01:00:34.099 --> 01:00:36.264
- Charlie!

01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:46.780
Charlie, no!

01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:27.151
Here.

01:01:36.128 --> 01:01:37.128
- He's gone.

01:01:39.835 --> 01:01:40.835
- These children.

01:01:46.138 --> 01:01:47.138
She's dead.

01:01:49.108 --> 01:01:50.108
- Please, no.

01:01:51.242 --> 01:01:52.242
Oh no.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:58.852
No. Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie.

01:01:58.887 --> 01:01:59.952
Charlie's still breathing.

01:02:03.188 --> 01:02:05.386
Come here, I got you.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:08.191
I got you, I got you.

01:02:10.261 --> 01:02:11.261
I got you.

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:12.998
- Daddy, it hurts.

01:02:18.236 --> 01:02:19.532
- I tried to protect them.

01:02:19.567 --> 01:02:22.436
You did so good, Charlie.

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:23.569
You did so good.

01:02:23.604 --> 01:02:25.175
Don't you go.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.579
Don't you go.

01:02:33.614 --> 01:02:34.822
Please stay.

01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:38.584
You're my boy.

01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:39.893
You're my boy, Charlie.

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:41.158
Don't go.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.395
I got you.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.805
Daddy's here, Daddy's here.

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:56.877
Please God,
please don't take him.

01:02:56.912 --> 01:02:58.175
Don't take him.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.341
Don't take him.

01:03:02.214 --> 01:03:03.576
No!

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.514
Every night.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.891
We'd sit around the table.

01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:22.556
She'd read a Bible
verse out of this Bible.

01:04:22.591 --> 01:04:25.097
We'd take turns
sayin' the nightly prayer.

01:04:28.399 --> 01:04:29.399
Char.

01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:38.308
Charlie was always the first
to say the same prayer.

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:46.547
He became a man the day I left.

01:04:49.222 --> 01:04:50.452
And died an innocent.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:57.690
I know if they shot him.

01:05:01.234 --> 01:05:02.530
He was trying to save somebody.

01:05:13.015 --> 01:05:14.311
- My husband Charles and I

01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:18.216
planned to escape
the plantation.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.616
Mary was a baby.

01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:29.326
And we wanted to give her
a better life.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.397
We almost got
off that plantation

01:05:34.432 --> 01:05:35.728
when we got noticed.

01:05:40.801 --> 01:05:44.440
Charles told me, "You run,
and you don't look back."

01:05:48.809 --> 01:05:51.216
Well, I circled back and.

01:05:55.057 --> 01:05:57.288
They hammered him to a cross.

01:06:00.392 --> 01:06:06.429
And set him on fire
right in front of my eyes.

01:06:23.448 --> 01:06:27.285
- It doesn't seem fair
what some have to go through

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.583
on this side of life.

01:06:33.194 --> 01:06:34.194
I'm sorry.

01:06:48.209 --> 01:06:49.307
Thank you.

01:06:56.448 --> 01:06:59.053
- I'm gonna find
your daughter, Miss Beggs.

01:07:02.223 --> 01:07:03.750
I'm gonna get my children back.

01:07:06.392 --> 01:07:07.655
Nothin's gonna stop me.

01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:10.131
Nothin'.

01:07:20.505 --> 01:07:21.537
Just give me a minute.

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:44.230
- I'm gonna miss you, son.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.162
<i>Father, don't go.</i>

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:24.667
Oh, Lily.

01:08:25.834 --> 01:08:29.341
I promise you;
I'll be home soon.

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:42.420
- How do you reckon
we find them?

01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:44.256
- We'll lure them to us.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:45.786
Yes.

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:48.689
They'll be back for the next
wagon train passing by.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:49.725
Just a matter of time.

01:08:54.401 --> 01:08:55.928
- Let's get ready.

01:09:21.626 --> 01:09:22.921
Take your time.

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:24.296
Don't be nervous.

01:11:08.095 --> 01:11:09.732
Keep calm.

01:11:09.767 --> 01:11:10.799
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:12.407 --> 01:11:13.407
It's okay.

01:11:37.157 --> 01:11:38.728
Phil. Phil.

01:11:55.747 --> 01:11:56.812
- Tell me.

01:11:56.847 --> 01:11:58.385
Is that where my children are?

01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:16.865
- Did you kill my son?!

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.439
Did you kill my son?!

01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:49.696
How many men inside your camp?

01:12:51.506 --> 01:12:53.539
- Many.

01:12:53.574 --> 01:12:54.672
Many men.

01:12:57.776 --> 01:12:59.336
- All right,
you're gonna lead us there.

01:14:38.338 --> 01:14:40.173
- Shantu, take your men.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:41.977
You guys drop down the ridge.

01:14:42.012 --> 01:14:43.132
I'll meet you in the middle.

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:37.670
[Ingrid No! Get off of her.

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:40.333
No, get off of her.

01:16:03.093 --> 01:16:04.763
No. Get back, get back.

01:16:10.903 --> 01:16:12.364
- Move back that way, that way.

01:16:18.009 --> 01:16:19.206
Lily!

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.769
- Where'd they go?
- They ran that way.

01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:34.991
Lily!

01:16:46.741 --> 01:16:47.741
Come on!

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.304
Come on, come on, come on.

01:16:51.339 --> 01:16:53.812
Get up. Get up, come on.

01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:05.153
- Phil!

01:17:07.828 --> 01:17:10.356
- Are you okay?

01:17:10.391 --> 01:17:12.226
- I'm sorry.
- I got ya.

01:17:18.036 --> 01:17:19.431
- Watch it.
Go get the kids.

01:17:19.466 --> 01:17:20.751
Get the kids.
- Get her to safety.

01:17:20.775 --> 01:17:21.775
Where's the girls?

01:17:34.789 --> 01:17:35.986
- Whoa,

01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:37.119
whoa.

01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:49.032
Daddy! Daddy!

01:18:32.946 --> 01:18:35.177
Lizzy, where's your sister?

01:18:35.212 --> 01:18:36.783
They took her.
They took her.

01:18:36.818 --> 01:18:38.178
- Where? Where?
- Under the bridge.

01:18:40.217 --> 01:18:41.953
- Okay.

01:18:41.988 --> 01:18:43.218
Here's my pistol.

01:18:43.253 --> 01:18:45.858
If anybody
comes near you, shoot.

01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:47.552
Okay?

01:18:47.587 --> 01:18:49.026
Okay.

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:12.819
- Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:19:42.576 --> 01:19:43.982
- Oh, Lily.

01:19:45.183 --> 01:19:46.183
I got you.

01:19:46.217 --> 01:19:48.316
- Daddy, please,

01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:50.087
please don't leave me.
- You're safe now.

01:20:03.663 --> 01:20:04.663
Lily!

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:18.852
There you go.

01:20:22.649 --> 01:20:24.022
Alice.

01:20:32.197 --> 01:20:33.197
Mary?

01:20:34.331 --> 01:20:36.034
Mary!

01:20:36.069 --> 01:20:37.497
Mary. Mary.
- Mommy!

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.235
Mary!

01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:40.500
Oh my God.

01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:52.017
Let me look at you.

01:20:52.052 --> 01:20:54.118
Oh, you okay?

01:20:54.153 --> 01:20:55.515
Huh?

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:57.616
I missed you so much.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.100
- I hope you've
made peace with God.

01:21:09.135 --> 01:21:13.236
You killed my son,
and I'm gonna make sure

01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:16.041
every single one of you
pay the price.

01:21:16.076 --> 01:21:17.076
Jack.

01:21:19.145 --> 01:21:20.145
Please stop.

01:22:10.724 --> 01:22:11.724
- Thank you.

01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:18.972
- We want peace as well.

01:22:23.176 --> 01:22:25.275
- Raise!

01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:28.080
Fire!

01:22:29.809 --> 01:22:31.479
<i>Shantu suggested to Father</i>

01:22:31.514 --> 01:22:33.987
<i>that we honor all lives
lost that day.</i>

01:22:36.453 --> 01:22:38.453
<i>That in order to bring peace,</i>

01:22:38.488 --> 01:22:42.028
<i>we must first acknowledge
our own mistakes</i>

01:22:42.063 --> 01:22:43.788
<i>and that those in power</i>

01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:47.231
<i>must seek to break
the cycle of violence.</i>

01:23:01.082 --> 01:23:03.412
<i>We ended up moving to Montana</i>

01:23:03.447 --> 01:23:05.579
<i>and used the land
the government gave us</i>

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:06.745
<i>to start an orphanage.</i>

01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:21.265
<i>We welcomed all who wanted to b
a part of our community</i>

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.796
<i>with the promise to also
learn from their traditions.</i>

01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:37.743
Welcome.
Nice to see you.

01:23:39.417 --> 01:23:40.779
Thanks for bringing
the children.

01:23:40.814 --> 01:23:42.352
- My pleasure.

01:23:42.387 --> 01:23:43.387
Watch your step.

01:24:00.504 --> 01:24:02.504
- Figure it was time
I started dreaming again.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:14.616
- Jack!
