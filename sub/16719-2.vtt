17:02.064 --> 17:03.370
No, I mean, he's right.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.285
It is a pretty safe
neighborhood.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.852
And yet, when you
least expect it...

17:07.852 --> 17:09.941
You know what? We will come in
for a cup of coffee

17:09.941 --> 17:11.682
if you don't mind, huh,
if it's no trouble.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.118
- Thank you.
- They're coming in.

17:13.118 --> 17:14.729
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.425
- Good work.
[Kay] Okay.

17:16.425 --> 17:19.038
Good work.
Good work.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.867
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

17:23.867 --> 17:25.695
I was trying
to appear nonchalant.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.872
I didn't want them
to be suspicious.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.310
Suspi...
They weren't suspicious.

17:30.310 --> 17:33.182
They weren't suspicious?
Are you kidding me?

17:33.182 --> 17:34.749
The way you were carrying on,
you would have thought

17:34.749 --> 17:36.490
there was a dead body
in the freezer.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.100
I mean, really,
you were babbling.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.536
Just come in.
Come in.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.842
Come in.
Have...

17:40.842 --> 17:42.191
Won't you come in
for coffee?

17:42.191 --> 17:43.845
You know, they were
about to leave.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.282
I was covering for you.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.023
I don't need you
to cover for me, you know.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.720
You're not a mastermind.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.374
Don't you understand
what would have happened?

17:51.374 --> 17:53.028
They would have gone
to the car.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.899
They would have sat in the
car for a minute or two.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.901
They would have realized
how guilty you sounded.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.729
They would've come back
and searched the house.

17:58.729 --> 18:01.341
Oh, great, so...

18:01.341 --> 18:04.561
thanks to you,
they're in the dining room.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.608
Here you go.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.523
Oh, thank you.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.481
Yeah, we figured
it was a false alarm,

18:11.481 --> 18:13.135
but you have to check it out.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.181
Well, we're...

18:15.181 --> 18:16.573
We live here alone,

18:16.573 --> 18:17.966
and we've lived here
for 26 years,

18:17.966 --> 18:19.228
and we've never
had a problem.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.535
Just alone,
just the two of us.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.798
It's a very low crime
neighborhood,

18:23.798 --> 18:26.583
or maybe I should say
no crime neighborhood.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.281
I mean, once last year,
a woman

18:28.281 --> 18:29.717
had her head cut off
with a meat ax.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.371
Ah, you can't win 'em all.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.024
Well, and they found
the head.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.331
So I read about that.
That was...

18:35.331 --> 18:37.028
And then there
was a few break-ins

18:37.028 --> 18:40.684
where this, uh, homicidal
maniac was murdering people

18:40.684 --> 18:42.295
and dismembering their bodies.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.992
Yeah.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.602
And down by Pine Street,
those two escaped convicts

18:45.602 --> 18:47.169
butchered a family of four.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.389
- Mm.
- With a chainsaw.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.217
Oh, I hope it was
an Olympia chainsaw,

18:51.217 --> 18:53.001
the chainsaw that cuts
through any substance

18:53.001 --> 18:54.742
like it was melted butter.

18:54.742 --> 18:57.658
My husband did the commercial
for that chainsaw.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.399
And then there was that
crazy who was going around

18:59.399 --> 19:01.140
lighting people's houses
on fire while they slept

19:01.140 --> 19:03.185
so they burned to death.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.839
But no other crimes
around here.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.362
Mm.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.103
At least there's
no jaywalking, you know.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.540
Mmm, this is good coffee.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.889
[Kay] Thank you.
[floorboards creaking]

19:11.889 --> 19:13.935
What's that noise.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.806
Who's this?

19:15.806 --> 19:17.460
[Sid] Oh.
[sighs]

19:17.460 --> 19:19.288
Oh, I don't...

19:19.288 --> 19:22.291
I don't know.
She's obviously lost.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.119
It's our daughter.
It's our daughter, honey.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.555
[laughing]
You really were asleep.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.817
- This is our daughter?
- Yes.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.993
- Since when?
- Elizabeth.

19:28.993 --> 19:32.606
Oh, this is our little girl
Priscilla.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.564
So you're not alone.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.611
Our daughter doesn't count.
She was a cesarean.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.613
She looks so familiar.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.397
Yes, to us too.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.225
She doesn't look
like either of you.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.009
She was adopted.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.490
Adopted, oh, I have
an adopted daughter.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.537
She's lovely, but she has
some psychological problems.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.799
Ours too.

19:51.799 --> 19:55.585
Her parents died
in a tsunami.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.458
Yes, they were covered over
with molten lava.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.937
From a tsunami?

19:59.937 --> 20:01.374
Back to bed, honey.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.810
Back to bed.
Maybe if I pointed her...

20:02.810 --> 20:04.464
I wouldn't touch her, sir.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.596
They taught us how to just
keep away from sleepwalkers.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.945
Oh, yes.
Well, go back to bed.

20:07.945 --> 20:10.296
Go...
Sweetheart, go back to bed.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.732
Go back...
You got to get rid of her.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.256
- Go back to bed.
- Back to bed, honey.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.563
Who does she remind me of?

20:16.563 --> 20:17.738
- To bed.
- Pigs.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.218
- What?
- Pigs.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.132
- Oh.
- Oh.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.525
Pigs... the pigs...

20:22.525 --> 20:24.658
She's having a farm dream.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.050
She's having
a farm dream.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.488
Her father raised pigs.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.446
Fascist pigs.

20:30.446 --> 20:34.407
And he was a fascist,
so he was a fascist pig farmer.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.235
- She's waking up.
- Honey.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.802
- Go back...
- To bed.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.762
[yawning]
Where am I?

20:41.762 --> 20:42.850
Who are you?

20:42.850 --> 20:44.025
[Sid] These are
friends of ours.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.156
[Kay] They're here
for coffee.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.549
[Darlene] Uh?

20:46.549 --> 20:47.811
Now go back to bed.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.073
Go back to bed,
you little...

20:49.073 --> 20:50.553
- Back to bed, honey.
- Get...

20:50.553 --> 20:52.338
- Here we go, back to bed.
- She's...

20:52.338 --> 20:53.643
Is everything all right?

20:53.643 --> 20:55.297
And you gentlemen
should be leaving now.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.865
I'm sure the neighborhood
is rife with fiends.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.258
Here you are.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.868
Oh-oh.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.131
[Sid] Ah, yes, she's always
that way, but, you know,

21:03.131 --> 21:04.437
with a mother's touch.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.134
I guess I would
be that way too

21:06.134 --> 21:09.311
if my parents had been
killed in a tsunami, you know,

21:09.311 --> 21:12.271
with molten lava and
falling rocks and a typhoon.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.709
Typhoon, it's a small novel
by Joseph Conrad,

21:15.709 --> 21:17.493
who's Polish, but he
wrote it in English.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.103
So, you know,
the Poles, they...

21:19.103 --> 21:20.714
[clears throat]
Good night. Good night.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.106
Thanks for
the coffee break,

21:22.106 --> 21:23.543
and good luck with
your daughter, you know.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.153
We adoptive parents,

21:25.153 --> 21:27.111
we're always taking
a risk, aren't we?

21:27.111 --> 21:29.418
It's a bit of a crap shoot,
but, uh, it's well worth it.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.680
You know, I love
mine to death.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.116
Yes, as you can see,
I do too.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.335
- Yeah, all right.
- And now out.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.468
She looks like
someone I know.

21:35.468 --> 21:38.035
Oh, yes, well, it'll
come to you, I'm sure...

21:38.035 --> 21:40.255
- With my luck.
- Yeah.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.518
Good night.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.867
God, that was close.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.740
It's now officially there.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.133
We're criminals.
We've crossed the line.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.961
We're...
This is it.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.441
We are?

21:52.441 --> 21:53.790
Yeah, we're harboring
a fugitive.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.401
We lied to the police.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.099
I can't think.
Really, let's go to bed.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.144
I want her out.
I want her out today.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.582
And since it's almost today,
I want her out now.

22:02.582 --> 22:03.974
- Okay, okay.
- I want you to...

22:03.974 --> 22:05.324
Okay. Let's...
We're all shot.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.586
Let's just go to bed.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.892
I don't care if her family
hid Anne Frank.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.285
I want her out.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.895
I hope that policeman
doesn't recognize

22:11.895 --> 22:13.157
where he saw her face.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.898
Yes, I hope that too, Kay.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.596
- And she's such a...
- You know...

22:16.596 --> 22:19.599
The sun comes up
and she's gone, like Dracula.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.644
Such a young, pretty girl.

22:21.644 --> 22:24.038
I just don't want her to spend
the rest of her life in jail.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.649
Meanwhile,
we committed a felony.

22:26.649 --> 22:31.393
I know, but it does get the
adrenaline going, doesn't it?

22:31.393 --> 22:34.962
I like it when my adrenaline
remains at sea level.
