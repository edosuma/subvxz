WEBVTT

00:15.000 --> 00:18.900
We're approaching insertion target area,
about a mile from your D.Z.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.900
You ready, WD-40?

00:22.599 --> 00:25.399
I never felt more ready
in my life.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.898
Oh, damn! What the hell--
Steele, are you crazy?

00:31.199 --> 00:34.998
Good afternoon, WD-40.

00:35.198 --> 00:38.297
We now begin "the free world's in
double jeopardy" round of your mission.

00:38.498 --> 00:40.998
- He's a sadistic criminal mastermind...

00:41.198 --> 00:43.798
and international arms dealer
who has brokered a deal...

00:43.898 --> 00:48.597
to sell a stolen Scorpion missile
to a Middle Eastern terrorist cell.

00:48.797 --> 00:50.897
The question is.
Who is Rancor?

00:51.098 --> 00:53.298
That's right.
General Derwood Rancor.

00:53.397 --> 00:57.297
So why don't you begin your mission.
And good luck to you, WD-40.

00:58.896 --> 01:01.196
And don't forget, WD-40,
as always,

01:01.396 --> 01:04.796
this tape will self-destruct
in three seconds.

01:04.995 --> 01:09.695
Steele!

01:56.791 --> 01:59.591
General Rancor,
your chopper's waiting.

01:59.791 --> 02:03.392
Fine. Be there in a minute.
I ain't done with this one yet.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.391
Talk to me, boy!

02:06.591 --> 02:11.591
He doesn't want to talk.
Take him outside and shoot him.

02:22.190 --> 02:27.190
And when you shoot him,
use the silencer.

02:43.988 --> 02:45.787
Thank you.
Have a nice flight.

02:48.388 --> 02:50.186
Have a great flight.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.187
- Enjoy destroying the world, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am, I will.

02:54.887 --> 02:57.588
I'm going in there.

02:57.687 --> 03:01.586
My God!
Look at you.

03:01.787 --> 03:04.786
- You are such an incredible man.

03:06.486 --> 03:10.785
It's my job, darling.
I do it for my country.

03:10.985 --> 03:14.786
Hmm? Oh. Good luck.

03:14.985 --> 03:17.485
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

03:37.983 --> 03:40.983
Nothing can stop me now!

03:41.183 --> 03:45.883
Not even that sanctimonious
secret agent Boy Scout Dick--

03:46.083 --> 03:48.083
Y oo-hoo!

03:50.982 --> 03:52.881
Steele?

03:56.482 --> 03:59.282
- Oh, Dick, don't drop me!
- Hold on! Whoa! Don't!

03:59.481 --> 04:03.382
- Grab my wrist!
- Oh!

04:05.981 --> 04:10.580
Whoa!

04:10.781 --> 04:13.380
- Don't drop me, Dick! Don't drop me!

04:13.580 --> 04:17.380
- Honey?

04:38.678 --> 04:43.479
A man of intrigue
He lives for the thrill

04:47.177 --> 04:52.476
Always has places to go
and people to kill

04:54.977 --> 04:58.277
Danger is the game he plays

04:58.477 --> 05:02.676
And he holds every card

05:02.876 --> 05:05.676
'Cause if you wanna win

05:05.876 --> 05:09.576
You gotta spy hard

05:12.376 --> 05:17.375
A man of the world
so suave and discreet

05:19.775 --> 05:25.375
He trips over the women
piled up at his feet

05:28.973 --> 05:31.574
But evil's lurking

05:31.774 --> 05:36.374
So he's always on his guard

05:36.573 --> 05:39.473
'Cause if you're gonna spy

05:39.574 --> 05:44.974
You better spy hard

05:45.172 --> 05:48.472
He's always there

05:48.672 --> 05:53.273
When the chips
are beginning to fall

05:53.473 --> 05:56.772
He wouldn't care

05:56.971 --> 05:59.472
If they kicked him
and grabbed him

05:59.672 --> 06:01.572
And shot him
and stabbed him

06:01.772 --> 06:05.471
And nailed both his ears
to the wall

06:07.171 --> 06:09.671
Facing death every day

06:09.872 --> 06:13.170
Is a tough job for any man

06:14.670 --> 06:17.970
But his hours are flexible

06:18.271 --> 06:21.470
And he's got
a great dental plan

06:23.069 --> 06:26.870
By the way
if you walked in late

06:27.070 --> 06:30.869
Allow me to reiterate

06:31.069 --> 06:34.569
The name of this movie

06:34.769 --> 06:38.368
Is Spy Hard

06:38.568 --> 06:42.568
They call it Spy Hard

06:42.768 --> 06:46.168
You're watching Spy Hard

06:46.469 --> 06:52.868
It's the theme from Spy Hard

08:19.660 --> 08:23.760
Sir, I hate to disturb you, but we're picking
up something interesting on the compound...

08:23.959 --> 08:26.359
- infrared detection system.
- Well, what is it?

08:26.559 --> 08:28.659
Oh, it's this really neat
security system, sir.

08:28.860 --> 08:33.159
- It picks up the body heat on the
intruders-- - Fine! What is it detecting?

08:33.359 --> 08:37.659
Oh, well, it looks like
Agent Barbara Dahl, sir.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.958
Barbara Dahl?

08:47.158 --> 08:49.558
Hot damn!
At last!

08:49.759 --> 08:51.657
Arm me.

08:53.357 --> 08:56.557
Y eah.
Now, bring me the bait.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.357
Welcome, Miss Dahl.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.757
General Rancor would like to see you.
Don't even think about it!

09:03.956 --> 09:06.557
Put the gun down!

09:12.156 --> 09:16.356
Move.
Don't try anything funny.

09:16.555 --> 09:19.155
Oh, you morons!

09:19.355 --> 09:22.055
Let go!
Oh! Oh!

09:22.355 --> 09:25.754
- Well, look at you.

09:25.954 --> 09:28.254
Barbara Dahl.

09:28.455 --> 09:31.755
If you ain't the spitting image
of your mama.

09:31.855 --> 09:37.054
Don't you talk about my mother,
you hybrid curiosity.

09:37.254 --> 09:39.354
My mother was twice the man you are.

09:39.553 --> 09:41.753
Hey, lady,
I think you're carrying...

09:41.953 --> 09:45.453
this "spitting image" thing
a little bit too far.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.453
Now that I got Barbara Dahl,

09:48.653 --> 09:53.152
it's just a matter of time
before Dick Steele comes to get her.

10:09.451 --> 10:11.451
Have you confirmed
this transmission?

10:11.651 --> 10:14.350
I have. It's confirmed.
It's Barbara Dahl.

10:14.551 --> 10:17.051
Who authorized Agent Barbara Dahl
to go on this operation anyway?

10:17.350 --> 10:19.950
No one.
She's working on her own.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.950
This one is personal, Coleman.

10:22.150 --> 10:26.150
Well, this personal mission may have
cost a good agent her life...

10:26.350 --> 10:28.349
and put the entire free world
in jeopardy.

10:28.549 --> 10:31.150
- We must inform the director.

10:31.350 --> 10:33.949
This is the director.
What is it, Coleman and Bishop?

10:34.250 --> 10:37.348
Sir, we've intercepted a very disturbing
satellite transmission...

10:37.549 --> 10:39.749
from our listening post
on the Rock of Gibraltar.

10:39.949 --> 10:42.149
- Well, what is it?
- It's this really big rock...

10:42.348 --> 10:44.948
sticking out of the water
on the south coast of Spain.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.947
What is the transmission?

10:51.148 --> 10:53.947
You will have to see it
to believe it, sir.

11:06.246 --> 11:09.147
- You've got to put it on channel three.
- No, four.

11:09.346 --> 11:12.645
- Switch it to VHS.
- And take it off of cable.

11:12.845 --> 11:15.146
Put it on the monitor.

11:15.246 --> 11:18.446
And now this
special message from Rancor Industries.

11:18.646 --> 11:20.845
She makes a pretty hood ornament,
don't you think?

11:21.045 --> 11:26.345
- Rancor!
- Y es, it is I, good ol' General Rancor.

11:26.545 --> 11:29.744
I'm back, big as life
and twice as ugly.

11:29.944 --> 11:32.544
- But Steele blew him up!
- Apparently not.

11:32.744 --> 11:35.344
You did everything
except eat me,

11:35.544 --> 11:37.343
and I'm still alive.

11:37.543 --> 11:40.144
All Steele did was blow off
a couple of arms.

11:40.344 --> 11:42.344
That's no biggie,
no big thing.

11:42.544 --> 11:44.344
Now I got plenty of arms!

11:44.544 --> 11:49.043
Big arms. Pretty arms. something.

11:53.343 --> 11:56.542
Your pretty little agent
is now part...

11:56.742 --> 11:59.142
of the nose cone
on top of my missile.

11:59.342 --> 12:03.741
This missile will be launched
in 36 hours...

12:03.941 --> 12:06.841
- and nothing will stop me!
- He's a madman!

12:06.941 --> 12:10.241
Only thing is,
I'm missing one little chip...

12:10.442 --> 12:14.340
that controls my satellite,
and, daggone, I want it back!

12:14.641 --> 12:18.041
Now you hand me my chip,
and I'll give you back your agent.

12:18.241 --> 12:21.739
Good God.
He must be stopped!

12:21.939 --> 12:24.939
Dick Steele couldn't
stop me 15 years ago,

12:25.140 --> 12:29.640
and all the dicks you've got
won't stop me now!

12:29.840 --> 12:31.739
Apparently,
he hasn't seen the size...

12:31.839 --> 12:33.839
of some of our newer members!

12:34.039 --> 12:36.939
- With the chip, he rules the world.

12:37.139 --> 12:41.138
- Without the chip,
he destroys the world and--

12:41.338 --> 12:44.939
- Would you practice someplace else?
I'm trying to think!

12:45.139 --> 12:49.338
- The world? Ha!

12:49.538 --> 12:51.838
We all know what
General Rancor really wants.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.338
- Steele. - That's right!

12:54.538 --> 12:57.737
- And we're going to give Steele to him.
- Steele?

12:57.937 --> 13:02.337
Have you forgotten what happened the last
time Steele was placed in the line of fire?

13:18.736 --> 13:22.135
We are stopping here. Traveller wants
to mingle with the crowd.

13:48.533 --> 13:52.333
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Steele, what the hell are you doing? Get off me!

13:52.532 --> 13:55.632
- Get him in there!
Get him in the limo! Cover him!

13:55.832 --> 13:59.832
Go, go, go! Go! Go, go!

14:05.932 --> 14:08.431
The bridge is out.

14:08.631 --> 14:11.531
Do not enter.
The bridge is out.

14:11.732 --> 14:15.531
The bridge is out,
damn it! Stop this car!

14:44.928 --> 14:47.329
- Stay away from the window, sir.

14:47.528 --> 14:49.928
Steele, do something!

15:08.726 --> 15:10.326
Good job, Steele!
Thanks!

15:10.526 --> 15:13.626
- It's about time
that jerk did something right.

15:13.826 --> 15:16.726
- Hang on, Mr. President!

15:24.725 --> 15:29.024
The bridge is out. Do not enter.

15:30.525 --> 15:35.123
Thank God our president
was one hell of a good swimmer.

15:35.424 --> 15:40.124
Nonetheless... there's only
one man for this operation.

15:40.324 --> 15:42.624
Agent WD-40.
Steele.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.823
Dick Steele.

15:45.023 --> 15:49.423
Dick, Dick, Dick Steele.

15:49.623 --> 15:52.024
Dick.

15:52.224 --> 15:56.722
Oh, Dick, that was incredible.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.922
- Thank you.

15:59.122 --> 16:01.122
Don't thank me, darling.

16:01.322 --> 16:05.122
The art of lovemaking takes two.

16:05.321 --> 16:09.721
Sometimes three or four, depending on
how well you do at the crap tables.

16:09.922 --> 16:11.421
- Fore!
- Well, my putter's up.

16:11.521 --> 16:13.721
- Fore!
- Well, my putter's up.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.721
Oh, Dick, I'm exhausted.

16:16.921 --> 16:21.920
- You are insatiable.
- Fifteen minutes to tee- off time.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.920
I think there's something you and I
should talk about openly and honestly...

16:26.120 --> 16:28.319
before I head off
to my golf game.

16:28.519 --> 16:31.820
- What is it, Dick?
- It's a game.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.920
People dress funny.
Hit a little ball with clubs.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.119
Drinking is involved.

16:37.319 --> 16:39.319
Is something wrong, Dick?

16:39.519 --> 16:41.819
Whatever we've had between us,

16:41.919 --> 16:44.819
I think it's only fair that you know
my heart still belongs...

16:45.019 --> 16:47.618
to the girl I fell
in love with years ago.

16:47.818 --> 16:50.118
Victoria.
She fell off a cliff.

16:50.318 --> 16:53.118
- She died.
- Yes, I know.

16:53.318 --> 16:55.317
I was just getting to that.

16:55.517 --> 16:58.517
But after Victoria Dahl,
well, I don't think...

16:58.717 --> 17:01.517
I'll ever find room
for another woman in this...

17:01.617 --> 17:04.715
ripped-apart, torn-up,
scarred, burned-out...

17:04.915 --> 17:07.317
Iump in my chest...

17:07.517 --> 17:10.316
where a human heart once beat.

17:10.517 --> 17:13.715
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say to you.

17:13.915 --> 17:16.915
Oh, I'll live, Mr. Steele.

17:17.116 --> 17:21.015
It's your life
I'm worried about.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.615
I'm glad you understand.

17:23.815 --> 17:27.915
- I know how much these things can hurt.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.914
Mr. Steele.

17:30.114 --> 17:32.515
[ Woman ] Hi, Dick.

17:37.114 --> 17:38.914
- Hi, Mr. Steele!
- Good morning, Mrs. Hudmucker.

17:39.114 --> 17:41.914
Fore!
- Watch out.

17:46.314 --> 17:48.713
- You all right?
- Thank you.

17:49.012 --> 17:51.713
A little help, please? Thank you.

17:54.413 --> 17:59.112
Dinatelli foursome
to starter's window. Mr. Jack Dinatelli.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.813
- Duck!

18:07.611 --> 18:10.212
- Dick, wait!

18:10.312 --> 18:14.711
Well, Steve!

18:14.910 --> 18:18.711
- Steve Bishop. You look great.
- Thank you. We go back a long way, huh?

18:18.911 --> 18:20.310
Yeah.

18:22.509 --> 18:24.310
- Let's have a drink.
- Okay.

18:24.510 --> 18:26.510
Just sit right there, Steve.

18:26.711 --> 18:29.610
- The usual, Mr. Steele?
- You betcha.

18:29.810 --> 18:32.010
- Well, how's everything at the agency?
- Ah, Dick...

18:32.209 --> 18:35.410
it used to be such fun
killin' a few spies...

18:35.509 --> 18:38.109
with gas from a banana grenade.

18:38.310 --> 18:41.609
But now, huh, it's all
bureaucratic politics.

18:41.709 --> 18:44.609
You gotta fill out 20 forms
in triplicate...

18:44.709 --> 18:46.709
just to take a piss!

19:03.207 --> 19:05.707
- Boy, that was fun.

19:05.807 --> 19:09.006
- Y eah.
- Thank you!

19:09.206 --> 19:11.506
Oh, man, they don't do stuff
like that at the agency any more.

19:11.707 --> 19:13.706
I'm sorry to hear that, Steve.

19:13.907 --> 19:16.306
- Uh, Dickie... there is something.
- Relax, sugar.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.705
Steve, I'm out of the Service.

19:18.905 --> 19:21.606
There's a plot
to launch a satellite.

19:21.706 --> 19:25.705
- Now, I'm out of the Service.
Talk about something else.

19:25.905 --> 19:28.305
- Bishop.
- Bishop here.

19:28.404 --> 19:30.405
- Got a new lead. Gonna need you here.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

19:30.605 --> 19:32.405
- And get a dozen eggs and a gallon of milk.
- Okay.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.404
- I'll leave right away.
- Thank you, sir.

19:34.604 --> 19:36.704
- No more headsets.

19:36.905 --> 19:38.905
Ear buttons. They put the receiver
right in your head now.

19:39.105 --> 19:42.104
- I gotta get back to the hotel.

19:42.304 --> 19:45.304
- The director wants you to see this.
- I'm not interested, Steve.

19:45.504 --> 19:48.103
Please, Dickie.
Take a look at the tape.

19:48.203 --> 19:48.304
Please, Dickie.
Take a look at the tape.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.103
It'll change your mind.

20:06.003 --> 20:08.401
Hmm-hmm.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.001
She makes a pretty hood ornament,
don't you think?

20:23.301 --> 20:28.400
[ Chuckles ] Yes, it is I,
good ol' General Rancor.

20:28.600 --> 20:33.300
I'm back, big as life
and twice as ugly.

20:36.699 --> 20:39.099
- All Steele did was blow off a couple of arms.
- Rancor!

20:39.299 --> 20:43.298
- That's no biggie, no big thing. Now I got plenty of arms.
- He can't be alive.

20:43.498 --> 20:46.598
- Your pretty Barbara Dahl--
- My God!

20:46.799 --> 20:49.099
Barbara Dahl.

20:52.298 --> 20:56.498
Victoria... why would your daughter
join the agency...

20:56.698 --> 20:58.798
knowing what happened to you?

20:58.998 --> 21:00.697
Why?

21:02.097 --> 21:03.897
Why?

21:04.197 --> 21:06.697
Why, why, why, why?

21:06.897 --> 21:12.496
Victoria Dahl...
you were the only woman I ever loved.

21:12.696 --> 21:16.796
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

21:16.996 --> 21:22.496
And just like the guy
whose feet are too big for his bed

21:22.696 --> 21:25.496
- Nothin' seems to fit

21:25.696 --> 21:30.895
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

21:31.095 --> 21:36.694
So I just did me
some talkin' to the sun

21:36.894 --> 21:42.494
And I said I didn't like
the way he got things done

21:42.794 --> 21:45.293
Sleepin' on the job

21:45.494 --> 21:49.393
- Those raindrops are fallin'
on my head

21:49.493 --> 21:54.193
They keep fallin'
But there's one thing

21:54.392 --> 21:56.392
I know

21:56.592 --> 22:00.293
The blues they sent to meet me

22:00.493 --> 22:03.292
Won't defeat me

22:03.492 --> 22:07.492
It won't be long 'til happiness

22:07.692 --> 22:09.892
Steps up to greet me

22:17.191 --> 22:19.191
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

22:19.391 --> 22:23.191
But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon be turnin' red

22:23.391 --> 22:26.890
For today's top story,
we now join Kelly Lange live downtown.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.490
Kelly Lange here
for Channel 3 lsland News.

22:29.690 --> 22:34.190
A tragic accident has claimed the life of
a businessman identified as Steven Bishop,

22:34.389 --> 22:39.389
when a huge grand piano fell from
the 17th floor of the Mayan Hotel...

22:39.489 --> 22:39.589
when a huge grand piano fell from
the 17th floor of the Mayan Hotel...

22:39.589 --> 22:41.889
directly behind me
and landed on his car.

22:41.989 --> 22:43.890
- An accident?
- It seems the man was--

22:43.989 --> 22:46.189
- Having a kid at 60, that's an accident.

22:46.288 --> 22:49.888
Having a piano fall on you,
that's... bad luck.

22:49.988 --> 22:53.688
We're told that they had to remove the
driver's body from the oil pan of the car.

22:53.888 --> 22:56.187
- Police are ruling this as an accident.
- Operator.

22:56.387 --> 22:58.688
Operator, get me Washington.

22:58.888 --> 23:00.788
- George?
- D.C.

23:06.387 --> 23:09.487
I'll take care of
the luggage, just some overnight things.

23:22.885 --> 23:25.686
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- ...no parking.

23:25.886 --> 23:29.086
Do not leave
your baggage unattended.

23:29.286 --> 23:32.285
It looks like
you could use a hand.

23:35.485 --> 23:39.283
I'm afraid I'm pretty clumsy.

23:39.484 --> 23:43.383
- You must be headed to Los Angeles.
- How do you know that?

23:43.584 --> 23:48.083
- It's written on your ticket.
- Oh! Thank you.

23:48.183 --> 23:50.483
You are welcome.

23:50.683 --> 23:52.984
Have a nice flight,
and I wish you adieu.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.683
Oh, thank you, but I'm quite satisfied
with the 'do I have.

24:04.182 --> 24:07.481
If you want to see me again,
turn around now.

24:17.481 --> 24:19.881
Aha.

24:29.980 --> 24:32.079
[ Flight Attendant ]
It's right here on the aisle.

24:32.179 --> 24:36.280
[ Man ] No, no, no.
I asked for a window seat.

24:36.579 --> 24:39.779
I can't be getting up and down just because
somebody wants to be getting in and out.

24:39.880 --> 24:44.179
- I have too much to do. I always have a window seat.
- Excuse me, sir.

24:44.379 --> 24:48.379
- I was wondering, do you mind?
- No problem. Please, be my guest.

24:48.579 --> 24:51.278
- Actually, I prefer an aisle seat.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

24:51.478 --> 24:54.678
- Be my guest. Here.
- Here, let me help you with these.

24:54.878 --> 24:59.577
I hope that this will be the last
of the conversations on this trip.

24:59.677 --> 25:01.177
Your ticket.

25:09.076 --> 25:10.976
Take it easy
with that luggage!

25:13.577 --> 25:17.076
Excuse me, sir. Could you put your
tray table up for takeoff, please?

25:17.276 --> 25:21.076
No, the tray table stays down, please.
Thank you very much.

25:21.276 --> 25:24.476
You've made things
inconvenient enough as it is.

25:24.576 --> 25:26.875
- What-- What is this?

25:27.075 --> 25:28.975
Is this yours?
Do you mind?

25:29.176 --> 25:32.675
- It's my briefcase.
Let me make more room for you.

25:38.974 --> 25:42.774
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

25:42.974 --> 25:44.774
Please.

25:44.974 --> 25:46.773
Thank you.

25:50.474 --> 25:54.973
Do you always take matters
into your own hands?

25:55.073 --> 25:58.473
Things often end up
in my hands.

25:58.673 --> 26:01.272
And I bet your hands
end up in a lot of things.

26:01.473 --> 26:03.272
Let's just say,
my hands and things...

26:03.472 --> 26:05.773
are often in the same place
at the same time.

26:07.372 --> 26:09.271
Could I get you
something to drink?

26:09.471 --> 26:13.972
We'll have dry Minoli and Russos,
on the rocks,

26:14.172 --> 26:15.971
stirred, not beaten,
twist of lemon,

26:16.172 --> 26:18.471
in chilled glasses,
not frozen.

26:18.671 --> 26:21.270
And two of those
curly little straws.

26:57.068 --> 26:59.568
Thirty hours, 11 minutes and 10 seconds.

26:59.768 --> 27:02.267
Thirty hours, 11 minutes
and 8 seconds.

27:02.467 --> 27:04.467
Thirty hours, 11 minutes
and 5 seconds.

27:09.067 --> 27:12.466
[ Director Over Intercom ] Miss Cheevus,
when Agent Steele arrives, send him right in.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.466
Mm-hmm.

27:21.865 --> 27:26.065
- Miss Cheevus, is the director available?
- No, he's married.

27:26.166 --> 27:30.065
- Oh, you kidder.

27:30.264 --> 27:35.365
Miss Cheevus, you wouldn't be trying
to make things hard for me?

27:35.566 --> 27:38.665
Oh, Dick, if only I could.

27:38.865 --> 27:43.065
But you know you and I would work
so well together deep undercover.

27:43.264 --> 27:48.564
You know the agency's rules
about secrecy. They're very... rigid.

27:48.763 --> 27:52.864
- Yes, and we wouldn't want
to blow it, would we?

27:53.063 --> 27:55.063
Why don't you two just get a motel room?

27:55.362 --> 27:57.863
I need you in here now, Steele!

28:28.461 --> 28:32.860
Miss Cheevus, wasn't the director
in the office here?

28:33.060 --> 28:36.860
[ Miss Cheevus Over Intercom ] He just buzzed me from in there, my little pumpy
- whumpy.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.059
I'll just sit down
and wait for him.

28:58.358 --> 29:02.258
Great Scott!
Steele, see a doctor!

29:02.458 --> 29:06.257
Good show, Steele.

29:06.457 --> 29:10.457
I hid for two weeks from
my ex-wife's attorney in this outfit.

29:10.658 --> 29:12.957
It's good to see you, WD-40.

29:13.057 --> 29:15.056
You're always
my most noble warrior.

29:15.256 --> 29:17.556
- Glad to find you, sir.
- Yes, yes, well,

29:17.756 --> 29:20.456
we have to find someone else
far more important now.

29:20.656 --> 29:24.256
- You saw the tape with Rancor?
- I can't believe he's alive.

29:24.456 --> 29:26.756
He's a madman.
He wants the world.

29:26.955 --> 29:30.255
But I'll be perfectly frank, Dick.
He wants you first.

29:30.556 --> 29:34.255
He knew I'd send you the tape,
especially with Barbara Dahl on it.

29:35.955 --> 29:38.155
Barbara Dahl.

29:38.355 --> 29:41.154
Looks just like Victoria
when she was alive.

29:41.254 --> 29:43.354
We don't have time
for flashbacks.

29:43.554 --> 29:46.954
Rancor wants the world.
Fortunately, he wants to kill you first.

29:47.154 --> 29:51.153
That may give us needed time. Barbara Dahl's
last transmission was from Los Angeles.

29:51.353 --> 29:53.854
We couldn't hold the trace
long enough to pinpoint her.

29:54.053 --> 29:58.652
Find her, you find him,
you find the rocket.

29:58.853 --> 30:01.453
For the rest of it,
your guess is as good as mine.

30:01.652 --> 30:05.253
- Miss Cheevus, tell Noggin we're coming.

30:05.653 --> 30:07.452
- Hello, Noggin.
- Steele.

30:07.652 --> 30:11.252
Good to see you again. Do you have
a refill of that deathray laser watch?

30:11.452 --> 30:13.252
- Ah, a new air freshener?
- Careful!

30:13.353 --> 30:14.652
- Ah, a new air freshener?
- Careful!

30:14.852 --> 30:16.851
Whoo-hoo
Oooh

30:17.051 --> 30:19.752
Not again. Oh!

30:19.951 --> 30:22.451
Give me!

30:22.651 --> 30:24.650
Well, this looks like
a clever contraption.

30:24.851 --> 30:27.950
A mini--
A mini mobile crime lab?

30:28.151 --> 30:30.551
- It's a briefcase.
- I know. What does it do?

30:30.651 --> 30:34.250
It holds important papers,
files, pens and a calculator.

30:34.350 --> 30:36.850
I understand. But these numbers here,
are they in a certain sequence?

30:37.050 --> 30:39.349
The briefcase
is timed to explode?

30:39.550 --> 30:42.949
No, it's a lock so people other
than myself can't open my briefcase.

30:43.149 --> 30:46.249
Very complex
contemporary technology.

30:46.449 --> 30:50.748
All right, Steele, this is your standard,
state-of-the- art field kit with three additions.

30:50.948 --> 30:55.149
This is our latest development:
microchip Z-ray lenses,

30:55.349 --> 30:57.349
capable of penetrating
a layer of clothing.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.947
You'll be able to see if
an enemy is carrying a weapon.

31:00.047 --> 31:01.548
Oh. Director?

31:01.748 --> 31:06.347
Oh, now, Steele...
should you find your hands bound,

31:06.447 --> 31:11.846
what you can do is just reach down
and pull this pin with your teeth.

31:14.647 --> 31:18.446
Put the tube in your mouth, and squeeze
and it will emit a laser beam...

31:18.646 --> 31:21.546
powerful enough to cut steel.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.547
Fire in the hole, Director.

31:23.746 --> 31:26.345
- Huh? Oh.
- Thank you.

31:30.846 --> 31:32.745
Oh, and one more thing.

31:33.046 --> 31:34.844
This micro-detonator
has a built- in timer...

31:35.045 --> 31:37.445
set to explode 30 seconds
after you plant it.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.145
It has enough power
to blow up a two-story building,

31:40.345 --> 31:42.144
- so be careful.
- Fantastic.

31:42.345 --> 31:44.444
All right.
Well, here we go and, uh--

31:44.544 --> 31:47.744
- Oh, the glasses.
- Yeah. Thank you.

31:47.944 --> 31:49.844
Good to see you again, Noggin.

32:01.143 --> 32:03.443
Bienvenidos a Los Angeles.

32:03.642 --> 32:05.743
Welcome to Los Angeles.

32:05.942 --> 32:07.942
Ciudad de los angeles.

32:08.142 --> 32:10.241
City of the angels.

32:10.442 --> 32:12.441
?Dónde esta Maria?

32:12.642 --> 32:14.441
Where is Maria?

32:14.642 --> 32:17.242
Maria esta en la biblioteca.

32:17.442 --> 32:19.241
Maria is in the library.

32:19.441 --> 32:22.641
- Do you have a lighter?
- I use matches.

32:22.841 --> 32:25.441
Does your mother know you smoke?

32:25.541 --> 32:25.641
Does your mother know you smoke?

32:25.641 --> 32:28.341
Y es, but I don't inhale.

32:28.540 --> 32:32.040
- Kabul.
- Uh...

32:32.240 --> 32:34.940
I'm Kabul.
Agent WD-40?

32:35.140 --> 32:37.239
Get in, get in.

32:37.439 --> 32:39.439
In the car.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.838
Hello. Excuse me. Ha!

32:46.039 --> 32:49.139
Our operatives believe
you may already be in grave danger.

32:49.339 --> 32:53.039
Please take a look at this,
Mr. Steele.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.339
In that file is a photo
of Desiree More.

32:55.538 --> 32:59.938
She's an expert trained in karate, kung
fu and is a crack shot. Be on your guard.

33:00.038 --> 33:02.637
Rancor may have sent her
to take you out.

33:02.838 --> 33:05.737
She likes easy-listening
and guys who share their feelings.

33:05.938 --> 33:10.737
Her measurements: 36-24-36-22.

33:12.437 --> 33:15.537
Aye, and for God sakes,
be careful, WD-40.

33:15.737 --> 33:19.236
One time I got two cousins that got
salmonella poisoning in this hotel.

33:40.034 --> 33:43.435
Ah, sure looked like her.

33:43.635 --> 33:46.634
But you can't be too sure.

33:46.834 --> 33:49.633
Y eah, almost positive.

33:49.834 --> 33:51.634
Mm-hmm.

33:53.034 --> 33:54.834
Drink?

33:55.034 --> 33:57.633
- Only when I'm thirsty.
- Tap water okay?

33:57.833 --> 34:00.234
Poured, not decantered.

34:00.433 --> 34:02.133
Sometimes you see a woman you'd...

34:02.334 --> 34:04.132
just love to have kill ya.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.833
But timing is everything,
so that was not going to be today.

34:08.032 --> 34:10.132
Says who?

34:10.431 --> 34:13.132
She's pretty smart.
I decided to play it casual.

34:13.431 --> 34:16.232
Casual is overrated.

34:19.532 --> 34:21.431
Oops.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.230
I think the game is over,
Mr. Steele.

34:32.429 --> 34:34.831
You're gonna look like Swiss cheese
when they find you.

34:35.130 --> 34:39.130
Oh. That's no Gouda.

35:13.328 --> 35:16.026
"Coca Cabana."

35:21.526 --> 35:24.725
- I'll be back for you.
- Where are you going?

35:24.926 --> 35:27.026
In my country we have a saying:

35:27.226 --> 35:29.526
"A man who rides a camel is rich,

35:29.726 --> 35:32.725
but a man who drives a Ferrari
can get lucky.

35:35.625 --> 35:39.526
- Oh, gee, I am so sorry.

35:39.725 --> 35:41.524
- What's your phone number?
- Loser.

35:41.725 --> 35:43.725
Oh, thank you.

35:43.925 --> 35:46.424
Oh, like, look at what you've done.

35:46.624 --> 35:49.025
End of the line, pal.

35:49.225 --> 35:51.024
Uh...

36:06.223 --> 36:08.823
Hey, goombah!

36:09.022 --> 36:11.322
Huh?

36:17.122 --> 36:19.721
Well, well, if it isn't Agent Steele.

36:21.322 --> 36:25.021
Excuse me.
Uh, do you have a light?

36:27.721 --> 36:30.921
Y eah, sure.
I got a light.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.420
Ow. Ow. Ow.

36:47.119 --> 36:49.019
Very good.

36:49.219 --> 36:51.719
Well, remind me never
to light your cigarette.

36:51.919 --> 36:54.119
You don't lose guys
like that for long.

36:54.219 --> 36:56.319
Let's get the bus.
We'll be safe there.

36:59.019 --> 37:01.718
- Transfer? Uh, no, thank you.

37:04.618 --> 37:07.918
Mmm, nice dress.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.217
Next stop:

37:14.417 --> 37:16.617
Sunset Boulevard.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.117
I guess it's Sunset Boulevard.

37:28.216 --> 37:30.716
Pop quiz, hotshot.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.816
Someone on the bus
without a transfer.

37:33.016 --> 37:37.415
He won't pay the fare.
What do you do? What do you do?

37:37.615 --> 37:39.415
Stop the bus
and let him off?

37:39.614 --> 37:43.816
Negatory, honcho,
because he cut the brake line.

37:58.113 --> 38:00.614
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

39:07.808 --> 39:09.507
That was nice. Nicely done.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.008
That was nice. Nicely done.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.207
Thank you. Thank you.

39:13.407 --> 39:16.507
Next stop: Melrose. I think.

39:16.807 --> 39:20.008
Well, you must be "fameeshed."
Let's mangez.

39:20.207 --> 39:22.606
That sounds good,
but I'm hungry.

39:22.806 --> 39:24.606
Let's eat first.

39:27.806 --> 39:30.706
- Here you go.
You both enjoy yourselves.

39:31.005 --> 39:34.605
- Brian will be right here
to take your drink order.

39:34.806 --> 39:37.906
We shared an airplane, a drink.

39:38.106 --> 39:41.205
We've been chased,
bussed, seated, but...

39:41.405 --> 39:44.505
I still don't really know you.

39:44.705 --> 39:48.404
I'm Bud Fudlacker.
I have a small mail- order business.

39:48.604 --> 39:50.804
I travel with
the American Gladiators,

39:51.004 --> 39:53.604
I'm 55, I like small appliances...

39:53.704 --> 39:55.605
and I do tax accounting
on the side.

39:55.804 --> 39:59.003
Let me guess.
You are Dick Steele,

39:59.203 --> 40:02.603
Agent WD-40
with the Secret Service.

40:02.703 --> 40:06.503
You are 52,
you like big screen TVs...

40:06.702 --> 40:09.102
and you want to stop
General Rancor.

40:09.303 --> 40:12.102
That could describe
a thousand guys.

40:12.303 --> 40:14.102
Tell me about you.

40:14.301 --> 40:18.202
I like loose-fitting clothes,
and I drive a '69 Pinto.

40:18.402 --> 40:21.802
[ Chuckles ] Hi, I'm Brian.
May I take your drink orders, please?

40:22.002 --> 40:25.401
- I'll have--
- A dry Minoli and Russo on the rocks.

40:25.601 --> 40:28.002
Stirred, not beaten.

40:28.201 --> 40:32.000
With a twist.
In a chilled glass, not frozen.

40:32.201 --> 40:35.601
With two of those
curly little straws.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.501
Be right back.

40:39.501 --> 40:42.000
Tell me, who are you?

40:42.299 --> 40:45.699
Why don't you use your...

40:45.900 --> 40:49.199
Iegendary skills, and guess?

40:49.399 --> 40:53.599
You carry a UB-21 Schnauzer
with a Gnab silencer. That's K.G.B.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.899
You prefer an H&K over an A.K.
Your surveillance technique is N.S.A.

40:57.099 --> 40:59.998
Your I.D. is C.I.A.
You received your Ph.D. at NYU.

41:00.198 --> 41:04.998
Traded in your G.T.O. for a B.M.W.
You listen to CDs by R.E.M. and S.T.P.

41:05.198 --> 41:09.198
And you'd like to see J.F.K.
in his B.V.D.s, getting down with O.P.P.

41:09.397 --> 41:13.697
And you probably put the toilet paper back
on the roll with the paper on the inside.

41:13.897 --> 41:15.796
Hmm.

41:15.996 --> 41:19.797
Here's to your remarkable
powers of observation, Mr. Steele.

41:19.997 --> 41:24.796
I am Agent 3.14,
Veronique Ukrinsky.

41:24.996 --> 41:26.796
My father is the professor.

41:26.996 --> 41:31.096
Oh, yes, I know.
The megachip.

41:31.296 --> 41:34.695
When he found out he was making the chip
for Rancor, and not for the U.S.,

41:34.795 --> 41:37.196
he escaped with it,
and he is in hiding.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.296
In hiding?
Where?

41:39.495 --> 41:41.496
He would not take the chance
in telling me where he was headed,

41:41.695 --> 41:45.395
but he said,
"The pendant--

41:45.595 --> 41:51.194
Follow the path
of your pendant to find me."

41:51.393 --> 41:55.794
Hmm... haven't seen
too many like these.

41:55.994 --> 41:57.795
- Pendant.
- Pendant.

41:57.994 --> 41:59.593
- Pendant.
- Pendant.

41:59.793 --> 42:03.194
- Pendant.
- We don't have much time, WD-40.

42:03.293 --> 42:05.793
Sooner or later,
Rancor will find him.

42:05.993 --> 42:10.192
- I'll order our food to go.
- Oh, Dick, I am so worried about my father.

42:10.393 --> 42:13.593
What shall we do, huh?
What shall we do?

42:15.893 --> 42:20.591
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

42:20.791 --> 42:25.892
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

42:28.191 --> 42:33.891
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

42:33.991 --> 42:35.890
"C'est la vie"
said the old folks

42:36.090 --> 42:38.791
It goes to show
you never can tell

42:48.190 --> 42:50.290
Excuse me. Do you have reser.

42:50.490 --> 42:53.789
- Steele's here somewhere.

42:53.889 --> 42:57.589
Rancor wants him dead.
Find him.

43:00.689 --> 43:02.688
- Dance time is over.
Cigarettes? Cigars?

43:02.888 --> 43:04.789
- There he goes. Kill him!
- Throwing knife?

43:04.988 --> 43:07.989
Cigarettes? Cigars?
Throwing knife?

43:08.188 --> 43:09.688
Thanks.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.387
Cigarettes?
Cigars?

43:12.587 --> 43:16.388
- Whoops.

43:16.688 --> 43:18.488
Why?

43:24.687 --> 43:27.487
Quick. Get this
up against the door.

43:35.186 --> 43:37.385
I got an idea.

43:37.585 --> 43:39.685
This is a picture
of my father.

43:39.885 --> 43:42.985
If we get separated,
find him, save him.

43:45.585 --> 43:47.685
Why?

43:47.885 --> 43:51.985
- Go! Go, go, go!

43:52.185 --> 43:55.783
- Oh, shut up!
- Ow! I came here to dance!

43:55.984 --> 43:58.983
- Ow! Dick, help me!

43:59.184 --> 44:00.884
- I'll kill you!

44:01.083 --> 44:03.783
- Get in this--
- No, let me go!

44:17.682 --> 44:22.282
- Okay, let's go!
- Dick, help me!

44:28.982 --> 44:32.181
Follow the path
of your pendant to find me."

44:32.380 --> 44:35.481
- What is that?
- It's her pendant.

44:35.681 --> 44:37.781
"Follow the path
of the pendant to find me."

44:37.980 --> 44:40.380
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

44:40.480 --> 44:44.380
- Ah!
- What? What?

44:44.580 --> 44:46.680
No.

44:46.879 --> 44:49.480
Any idea where it came from?

44:49.679 --> 44:52.979
- Museum of Natural History.
- How do you know that?

44:53.179 --> 44:56.578
It says it really small
right there at the bottom.

44:56.779 --> 44:59.578
All right. Take me
to the Museum of Natural History.

44:59.779 --> 45:03.979
- You know, in my country we do
have a saying-- - I'm sure you do.

45:04.079 --> 45:04.279
- You know, in my country we do
have a saying-- - I'm sure you do.

45:04.279 --> 45:08.778
The saying goes: "The museum is closed at
5::00. You go the next morning at 9::00."

45:11.078 --> 45:13.977
Excuse me, Mr. Pushy!

45:14.177 --> 45:15.977
Son of a bitch.

45:18.177 --> 45:21.277
I'm getting sick and tired
of your--

45:32.376 --> 45:34.376
Mm-hmm.

45:38.576 --> 45:40.775
No, he'd never fit in there.

45:40.975 --> 45:45.575
Ah. Sir-

45:46.975 --> 45:48.774
I'm sick and tired
of these games.

45:53.774 --> 45:58.574
This is stupid. Stupid. We're
a government agency, for God sakes.

46:02.073 --> 46:03.974
Huh?

46:06.372 --> 46:08.173
Aha!

46:12.773 --> 46:15.672
Good God!
You're sicker than I thought!

46:16.972 --> 46:19.472
What is it, Coleman?
I'm busy!

46:19.672 --> 46:23.272
- I, uh, can see that.
- You wouldn't understand.

46:23.473 --> 46:25.472
It's the ancient art
of origatsi.

46:25.772 --> 46:29.571
What I don't understand is your insistence
in keeping Steele on this assignment!

46:29.772 --> 46:32.072
He still is
no closer to Rancor,

46:32.172 --> 46:35.071
and we have who knows how little time
left before Rancor launches this satellite.

46:35.171 --> 46:39.571
You better let me take over
this search before I--

46:39.771 --> 46:41.570
Before you what, Coleman?

46:41.770 --> 46:43.870
I don't know whose monkey
you spanked to get this job,

46:44.070 --> 46:46.770
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're a disgrace to the Service.

46:46.870 --> 46:48.770
How dare you!

46:48.870 --> 46:51.369
You and your one-for-all-and-all-for-one
bleeding heart nonsense!

46:51.570 --> 46:54.369
You're too old
to run this agency!

46:54.569 --> 46:56.870
And since you won't step down,

46:57.070 --> 46:59.768
you'll, uh, be stepped on!

47:01.968 --> 47:05.469
- Ha! Loser!

47:05.669 --> 47:10.167
- What you got?
- Is there a jewelery district in Los Angeles?

47:10.367 --> 47:13.968
Come on, this is Hollywood. We have jewelery.
We have women who are willing to sleep--

47:14.168 --> 47:18.167
- More important, is there a Russian jewelery section?
- Da.

47:18.367 --> 47:20.868
- Where?
- I don't know.

47:21.067 --> 47:24.767
There used to be a bunch of Russian
jewelers hung out at the warehouse at, uh...

47:26.267 --> 47:28.267
at 31st and Phlegm.

47:28.466 --> 47:31.966
- Ah, damn it!

47:32.166 --> 47:33.966
Meet me back at the hotel.
We'll split up.

47:34.165 --> 47:36.165
- After you.
- Thank you.

47:36.365 --> 47:38.166
Excuse me.

47:38.565 --> 47:40.666
- Get off!

47:57.164 --> 47:59.565
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

48:12.962 --> 48:15.062
Watch it! Watch it!

48:28.361 --> 48:30.161
- Whoa.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.461
- Cheerio.

49:02.658 --> 49:05.958
You're mine, Steele!

49:12.958 --> 49:15.158
- Whoa!

49:18.058 --> 49:20.557
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

49:26.357 --> 49:30.356
- Huh?

49:51.055 --> 49:55.554
Okay, bring it up!
Bring it up! Up, up, up!

49:55.754 --> 49:58.754
Okay, that's where
the sign goes!

50:00.755 --> 50:02.754
Ah, 31st and Phlegm.

50:02.954 --> 50:04.753
I'm on the waiting list
for a co-op.

50:11.454 --> 50:13.952
You better get outta here.
I'll see you back in half an hour.

50:14.052 --> 50:16.052
Oh, half hour?
I can drop off my dog at the groomer.

50:47.250 --> 50:51.849
- Wha--
- Mr. Steele, I presume?

50:51.949 --> 50:55.850
- Professor--
- Ukrinsky. With a "Y.'"

51:05.249 --> 51:08.648
Ah. Right.

51:10.949 --> 51:13.548
The pendant.

51:13.748 --> 51:15.947
And I suppose...

51:16.148 --> 51:18.348
this is what you need.

51:18.448 --> 51:23.447
- And this is?
- This is the controller chip for Rancor's satellite.

51:23.647 --> 51:26.047
Ah, Rancor finally
made his megachip.

51:26.346 --> 51:28.147
Who'd have thought the fate
of so many human lives...

51:28.346 --> 51:30.347
would rely on something so small?

51:30.546 --> 51:33.446
Well, there's only one thing
to do with this.

51:36.646 --> 51:41.146
No! No! What are you doing?

51:41.345 --> 51:44.945
- Trying to make the world safe from tyranny.
- You mustn't do that!

51:45.145 --> 51:47.746
This can also be used
for world peace!

51:47.845 --> 51:49.845
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:50.044 --> 51:53.845
You'd better let me get that into
the proper hands and get you to safety.

51:56.544 --> 51:58.743
- You found me through my daughter, the pendant.
- Right.

51:58.944 --> 52:03.244
- Veronique is safe?
- Yeah, the van they took her in has dual air bags and seat belts.

52:05.944 --> 52:08.543
- Kabul.
- Nice new wheels, huh?

52:08.743 --> 52:12.343
Yeah, quite an improvement.
In the back, Professor.

52:12.544 --> 52:15.243
We have to find a safe place
for the professor.

52:15.443 --> 52:17.342
In my country,
we have saying:

52:17.542 --> 52:20.742
"The rabbit hops, the spider crawls,
but the camel spits".

52:20.943 --> 52:22.943
Let's see
if this Charger can run.

52:28.542 --> 52:30.542
Now I don't want you
to be surprised.

52:30.742 --> 52:34.741
This guy's one of our top agents.
He's most capable.

52:40.141 --> 52:42.140
- McCluckey!
- Kabul!

52:47.041 --> 52:50.041
- Come on in.
- All right. Come on.

52:50.241 --> 52:52.739
McCluckey, we need
to hide the professor.

52:53.039 --> 52:56.139
- Professor Ukrinsky, it's an honor.
- How do you do?

52:56.340 --> 52:59.439
I've read all your work and your
last paper on laboratory loneliness.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.338
- Superb!
- Well, thank you.

53:02.538 --> 53:05.039
- McCluckey, I'd like you to
meet Agent-- - Dick Steele.

53:05.239 --> 53:08.837
Agent WD-40.
Good to see you back in action.

53:09.038 --> 53:13.738
Your video on deception,
Is It A Woman? Is The Moustache Real?

53:13.838 --> 53:15.738
Beautiful work!

53:15.838 --> 53:19.338
- Thank you.
- McCluckey, we need to hide this guy.

53:19.538 --> 53:22.937
Sure, sure. Come this way.
He'll be safe here.

53:24.037 --> 53:25.938
Do you have a telephone?

53:26.038 --> 53:28.037
Right over there.

53:28.236 --> 53:31.337
- Is it clean?
- I have a woman that comes in once a week.

53:35.736 --> 53:38.436
- Sir?
- What?

53:38.636 --> 53:41.235
I have Dick "Luscious Lips"
Steele on the line.

53:41.436 --> 53:44.635
Put him through.

53:44.835 --> 53:46.635
Director, is it safe?

53:46.735 --> 53:52.035
Safe? Just
a minute. I'll use the cloaking device.

54:01.733 --> 54:03.933
Go ahead, Dick.
It's safe.

54:04.133 --> 54:07.534
I have the chip
Rancor needs to launch his satellite.

54:07.734 --> 54:11.933
Good, Dick, good. Are you coming in?

54:12.133 --> 54:14.233
No, Rancor kidnapped
the professor's daughter.

54:14.433 --> 54:16.433
I've got to find her.

54:16.633 --> 54:19.532
- Yes, well... good, Dick.

54:19.732 --> 54:23.632
Good luck.
Call me if I can help.

54:31.932 --> 54:35.732
- Nineteen hours and 35 minutes.
- That Steele's gonna be sorry...

54:35.932 --> 54:38.131
his mama ever met his papa.

54:38.231 --> 54:42.431
- We gonna heat up the fire! Boys!

54:42.631 --> 54:44.431
They always seem to know
every move we make.

54:44.631 --> 54:46.430
It's inside.
It's got to be somebody inside leaking.

54:46.630 --> 54:49.330
Well, I'm not leaking.
I can prove it.

54:49.530 --> 54:51.331
- You go ahead, ask me something.
- What?

54:51.530 --> 54:54.329
Ask me something.
Ask me who's the director of our agency.

54:54.530 --> 54:57.630
- Who is the director of our agency?
- I don't know.

54:57.830 --> 54:59.629
You see, I know who it is, you see?

54:59.830 --> 55:03.828
But I'm not going to tell you,
you see, because I am no leak.

55:03.929 --> 55:06.529
This place has got to be
a front for Rancor and his men.

55:06.728 --> 55:11.729
- There's one of them now. Follow him.

55:11.928 --> 55:14.428
Do you have
to keep revving the engine?

55:14.628 --> 55:18.828
Ah, but it's an American V-8.
It's such a beautiful sound.

55:19.128 --> 55:21.227
- Oh, Steele, listen to this.

55:21.427 --> 55:24.627
- My cousin's a recording star.

55:24.828 --> 55:27.327
- Duck! Ow!

55:38.926 --> 55:41.526
- Did he see us?
- Shh. Okay.

55:48.925 --> 55:51.225
- I'm going in there.
- Okay.

55:51.325 --> 55:54.825
- Give me cover.
- I got to buy my lottery ticket.

56:00.224 --> 56:02.725
- Rancor's guy is here.
- Right.

56:02.924 --> 56:06.724
That saved a wretch

56:06.924 --> 56:09.523
Like me

56:09.724 --> 56:14.323
I once was lost

56:14.622 --> 56:19.323
But now am found

56:19.523 --> 56:21.723

56:25.922 --> 56:29.723
- What are you doing here?
- I am... the new choirmaster.

56:29.922 --> 56:34.121
- Where did you come from?
- The humble room. I was doing refractories.

56:34.221 --> 56:36.922
- "Refractories"?
- A new popal revelate.

56:37.122 --> 56:39.920
Uh, John, chapter 7, verse 2.

56:40.121 --> 56:41.421
"Popal"?

56:41.621 --> 56:45.421
Uh, sisters.
Michael, chapter 7, verse 2.

Yea, unto thee
a voice like a blenth."

57:01.919 --> 57:04.719
Kick my heels up and shout
Throw my hands up and shout

57:04.919 --> 57:07.918
Throw my head back and shout
Come on now

57:08.118 --> 57:10.218
Don't forget
to say you will

57:10.419 --> 57:13.218
- Are you gentlemen with Rancor?

57:13.418 --> 57:16.617
- Steele's here somewhere.

57:16.818 --> 57:19.418
- Sing it right now baby

57:36.116 --> 57:40.316
Come on now
Come on now

57:40.516 --> 57:45.316
I still remember when
I used to be nine years old

57:45.515 --> 57:48.915
- Hey, yeah and I was a fool for you
- All right, random inspection.

57:49.116 --> 57:52.114
- From the bottom of my soul
- Directive 21, Psalm 2.

57:52.315 --> 57:56.715
Yeah, yeah
I want you to know

57:56.915 --> 58:00.914

to know right now Ew!

58:01.214 --> 58:03.514
You been good to me sisters

58:03.715 --> 58:06.314
Much better than I've been to myself

58:06.514 --> 58:08.914
So good, so good

58:09.114 --> 58:14.013
And if you ever leave me
I don't want nobody else

58:14.214 --> 58:18.912
Hey, hey
I said I want you to know

58:19.112 --> 58:21.813
I said I want you
to know right now

58:21.913 --> 58:23.813
- Veronique?

58:23.913 --> 58:26.112
- Dick.
- You all right?

58:26.312 --> 58:30.912
- Get out of here. This is a front for Rancor.
- Yes, I know.

58:31.112 --> 58:37.011
I'll-- I'll get out of here, all right.
But you're coming with me.

58:37.112 --> 58:38.811
Stat! Code Yellow!
Code Yellow!

58:39.011 --> 58:41.711
- Get me three CCs of epinephrinox!
- Right away.

58:41.911 --> 58:44.511
- Get me two liters of gasohol mixed with neonephicine!
- On my way.

58:44.711 --> 58:47.010
- Get the electrostatifyer, now!
- I'll warm up the generator, sister.

58:47.210 --> 58:49.210
She's about to go
into fibrolcanination!

58:49.310 --> 58:51.510
- Prepare the operating room!
Yes, sister. I'll get right on it.

58:54.609 --> 58:58.410
For God's sake, can anyone
in this hospital help me?

58:58.610 --> 59:02.809
- Say it right now, baby

59:03.009 --> 59:05.009
- Come on, come on.

59:06.609 --> 59:08.609
- Say that you will.

59:08.809 --> 59:12.809
- Now wait a minute

59:13.108 --> 59:16.109
Oh. Mm-mm. No.

59:16.308 --> 59:18.307
You know you make me
want to shout

59:28.106 --> 59:30.306
High blood pressure.

59:34.607 --> 59:39.106
Here. You'll be safe here.
I'll be right back.

59:48.206 --> 59:52.205
- Okay, the coast is clear.

59:52.305 --> 59:57.105
Oh, Dick, it's so cold.

59:57.304 --> 01:00:01.704
What have they done to you?
They'll pay for this.

01:00:01.905 --> 01:00:03.803
Oh, Dick...

01:00:11.204 --> 01:00:13.903
Move 'em, fat heads!

01:00:14.003 --> 01:00:16.604
Sisters, make 'em holy!

01:00:19.103 --> 01:00:21.502
Oh, Dick, you came for me.

01:00:21.703 --> 01:00:25.203
Tell me, what's been happening?

01:00:25.502 --> 01:00:29.102
Well, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching,
getting in touch with my inner child.

01:00:29.302 --> 01:00:31.102
I have decided I love you.

01:00:31.302 --> 01:00:33.502
But what about my father?

01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:36.902
Well, I like him.
I just have to get to know him better.

01:00:37.102 --> 01:00:39.400
No, is he okay?
Have you got his chip?

01:00:39.601 --> 01:00:41.801
Oh, no, he's fine,
and I've got the chip.

01:00:42.001 --> 01:00:44.301
- Oh, I love you too.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.800
- Look out, you crazy nun!

01:00:58.099 --> 01:01:00.600
Thanks, guys, I stopped you.
You could have been killed!

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.398
Quick, let me help.

01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:06.498
You smell nice.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:11.299
Where is my father?

01:01:11.399 --> 01:01:13.298
Is he safe?

01:01:13.398 --> 01:01:16.798
He's safe, Veronique.
Safe as you and me.

01:01:16.999 --> 01:01:19.299
So cute.

01:01:19.498 --> 01:01:21.797
- Oh! Oh!

01:01:21.897 --> 01:01:24.197
- Safer.

01:01:24.398 --> 01:01:27.698
In my country, when an irate,
armless, psychotic weirdo...

01:01:27.898 --> 01:01:29.698
chase your woman,
you must hide her.

01:01:30.997 --> 01:01:32.897
Upstairs.
Apartment 5B.

01:01:33.097 --> 01:01:34.997
I'll wait downstairs.
I'll keep my eyes open.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:42.396
I just put in new carpet.
Take your shoes off.

01:01:50.095 --> 01:01:54.495
Oh, Dick... it is so nice to know...

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:57.594
that everything
is going to be all right.

01:01:59.494 --> 01:02:01.894
You have the chip.

01:02:02.095 --> 01:02:05.694
My father is safe.

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:08.494
You love me, Dick.

01:02:08.694 --> 01:02:10.594
Love?

01:02:12.094 --> 01:02:15.993
Let me tell you
about love, Veronique.

01:02:16.293 --> 01:02:19.893
Love is a dew drop
on a rose petal.

01:02:19.993 --> 01:02:22.693
- Love is a drop of rain,

01:02:22.894 --> 01:02:26.193
pure and shimmering
and trembling.

01:02:26.392 --> 01:02:29.592
So moist, so wet.

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:34.792
- And those tiny little drops of love,

01:02:34.991 --> 01:02:36.892
they come together,

01:02:37.092 --> 01:02:41.091
gathering up broken buds
and fallen flowers...

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:45.391
and dirt and dung...

01:02:45.591 --> 01:02:47.491
- and deer droppings,

01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:52.390
flowing faster and faster,
outward to the sea.

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:55.090
- Onward and onward -

01:03:18.888 --> 01:03:20.788
Good night.

01:03:20.988 --> 01:03:24.787
We'll talk more
in the morning.

01:03:52.085 --> 01:03:54.385
- Hey, hotshots.

01:03:54.685 --> 01:03:58.385
- Come and get me. - Why, you
little, no- good juvenile delinquent!

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.285
- Go on! Get him!
- Come on!

01:04:02.185 --> 01:04:05.385
- Cool. Heads up!

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:09.183
- Nice shot. I'm going.
- Go on! Go on!

01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:12.583
- We got you now!

01:04:12.784 --> 01:04:14.784
Where's the professor?

With Gilligan, dickweed.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.383
- No!
- This is for Getting Even With Dad!

01:04:24.483 --> 01:04:27.082
- And this is for My Girl.
- And this is for My Girl 2.

01:04:27.283 --> 01:04:30.282
I wasn't even in My Girl 2.

01:04:30.483 --> 01:04:32.683
- We don't care!
- We don't care!

01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:37.782
Last time I'm gonna ask you,
smart boy.

01:04:37.982 --> 01:04:41.581
- Where's the professor?
- Okay, okay, down the hall to the right.

01:04:43.282 --> 01:04:45.581
Okay, the left!

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:51.681
Help! Somebody help me!

01:04:51.881 --> 01:04:55.280
They're taking us to Kikiree lsland!

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:03.679
- They've taken him to Rancor!
- They won't kill him... not until he's installed the chip.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.479
- Wha-- - Probably not even then.
Maybe just torture him a little.

01:05:07.679 --> 01:05:11.179
- We'll talk about this on the way.
Let's get to Kikiree.

01:05:22.078 --> 01:05:24.478
You like this disguise?

01:05:24.677 --> 01:05:26.678
It's very good.

01:05:26.878 --> 01:05:28.677
I'm proud of this one.

01:05:28.877 --> 01:05:32.177
Like this,
I can look like anybody.

01:05:32.377 --> 01:05:36.278

01:05:36.477 --> 01:05:36.577
- Rancor Industries

01:05:36.577 --> 01:05:41.076
The natives say there are stranger goings-on
here than at Neverland Valley Ranch.

01:05:41.176 --> 01:05:43.977
- Look.
- Uh-huh. It's nice.

01:05:45.476 --> 01:05:49.475
- Kabul, stay in the boat.
- Why?

01:05:49.675 --> 01:05:51.476
There's a saying
in my country:

01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:54.675
"When you hear the words, 'Stay in
the boat', you stay in the boat."

01:05:54.874 --> 01:05:56.975
- Bye-bye.

01:06:04.674 --> 01:06:07.274
Dick, this is crazy.

01:06:07.474 --> 01:06:12.673
Crazy? Some people think walking down
the street muttering to yourself is crazy.

01:06:12.874 --> 01:06:14.673
I'll tell you
what crazy is.

01:06:14.873 --> 01:06:17.573
Crazy is walking down the street
with half a cantaloupe on your head,

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.873
saying, "I'm a hamster.'"

01:06:20.073 --> 01:06:22.373
"I'm a hamster.'"
That's crazy.

01:06:29.472 --> 01:06:31.472
- Ooh.

01:06:31.672 --> 01:06:34.472
My life's work
is now complete.

01:06:34.672 --> 01:06:37.272
Your cooperation
is commendable, Professor.

01:06:37.472 --> 01:06:39.271
Thank you.

01:06:42.471 --> 01:06:44.272

01:06:44.472 --> 01:06:47.471

for the world peace! Yeah, yeah.

Hello, General. It's Skippy.
They're on the island.

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:02.870
Yeah.

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:06.469
Well, well, well,
what perfect timing.

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:08.569
- It seems we're gonna have more guests.

01:07:08.669 --> 01:07:10.769

01:07:10.969 --> 01:07:12.769
He's on his way here.

01:07:12.969 --> 01:07:16.568
- Throw her in with the others!
- No! Please! Please!

01:07:16.769 --> 01:07:20.769

All right, men, tie him up.

01:08:11.864 --> 01:08:14.764

01:08:14.964 --> 01:08:18.662
I got a bomb. You touch me,
and you'll blow up yourself.

01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:22.863
You don't really think I'm gonna fall for
that old tied- to-the-bomb trick, do ya?

01:10:27.652 --> 01:10:30.153
- Father!
- My child.

01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:35.152
Well, well.
Dick Steele.

01:10:35.353 --> 01:10:38.151
I'd shake your hand,
but I don't remember where it landed.

01:10:38.352 --> 01:10:41.852
- Clever! Clever? Clever.

01:10:42.052 --> 01:10:44.152
Take their weapons.

01:10:47.851 --> 01:10:49.651
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:52.051 --> 01:10:55.250
Throw her in with the others.
Bind him.

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:02.650
- Oh, Papa.

01:11:02.849 --> 01:11:05.550
- Dick Steele?
- Oh, Ms. Dahl.

01:11:07.349 --> 01:11:09.249
- Barbara Dahl.
- Get your paws off me,

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:11.448
- Huh.
- you damn dirty apes!

01:11:15.549 --> 01:11:17.649
- No!
- You remember Barbara Dahl.

01:11:17.849 --> 01:11:19.649
Victoria's daughter?

01:11:19.849 --> 01:11:25.248
I'd like to see you watch her go up
like you watched her mother go down.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:29.947
But I'd rather let you just be
a dessert for my little pet.

01:11:31.848 --> 01:11:34.748
What's left of you will have
to watch helplessly...

01:11:34.848 --> 01:11:39.546
while I play Mortal Kombat
with the entire world!

01:12:19.344 --> 01:12:24.043
Huh?

01:12:31.642 --> 01:12:34.543
It's gonna blow! Hurry up!

01:12:45.842 --> 01:12:48.740
Come on!

01:13:31.438 --> 01:13:33.437
You are very immature.

01:13:33.637 --> 01:13:35.937
Bullies tend to have
very bad self- esteem.

01:13:38.238 --> 01:13:41.437
Aha!

01:13:43.036 --> 01:13:45.637
Oh-ho!

01:13:48.637 --> 01:13:51.036
Leave me alone!
I'm an unarmed man!

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:26.233
- Oh, Miss Cheevus.
- Dick, I'm sorry.

01:14:26.433 --> 01:14:29.833
- One minute and 22 seconds.
One minute and 21 seconds.

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:32.133
- One minute and 20 seconds.
- You were under the influence of an evil man.

01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:34.332
- One minute and 19 seconds.
- It was still a lousy thing to do.

01:14:34.531 --> 01:14:38.332
One minute and 18 seconds.
One minute and 17 seconds.

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:43.032
- One minute and 16 seconds.
- Oh-oh. General, it's broken.

01:14:43.132 --> 01:14:47.031
Well, you'll like space.
Lots of elbow room and--

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:49.332
- One minute and 12 seconds.
- Oh, whoops. Sorry.

01:14:49.432 --> 01:14:53.030
- One minute and 11 seconds.
One minute and ten seconds.

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.831
Y eah, you lose, Steele!
That countdown is irreversible!

01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:01.030
- Really?

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.629
- One minute and five seconds.
- Well...

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.730
- let's just see how...
- We need to go!

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.830
- One minute and three seconds.
- irreversible that really is.

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.829
It's irreversible,

01:15:09.929 --> 01:15:13.129
and there's nothing you
patriotic pansies can do about it!

01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:15.530
- 59 seconds, 58 seconds. Let me tell you
what being patriotic really is,

01:15:15.729 --> 01:15:18.529
you scumbag poop.

01:15:18.828 --> 01:15:22.328
This is a great country where a man can
sue anyone he wants anytime he wants.

01:15:22.528 --> 01:15:26.229
It's a great country because
thousands of people die every year...

01:15:26.329 --> 01:15:28.827
from handguns, and,
yet, at this very moment,

01:15:29.028 --> 01:15:33.828
you can still walk into a convenience
store anywhere and buy one of those guns.

01:15:34.027 --> 01:15:36.226
- That's democracy.
- It's finally time somebody does...

01:15:36.427 --> 01:15:38.326
what that fool Steele
should have done.

01:15:38.527 --> 01:15:40.227
- This is a great country...
- And it's gonna be me!

01:15:40.427 --> 01:15:45.426
- because anyone who's male has the right...
- Let's go!

01:15:45.526 --> 01:15:49.027
- to run for the office of the President.
- Let's go! Move it!

01:15:49.226 --> 01:15:52.027
- This is a great country
because any moron can

01:15:52.227 --> 01:15:54.326
- All right, everyone, drop your guns!

01:15:54.525 --> 01:15:56.625
I'm, uh, taking over!

01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:01.626
Steele... get down from there.

01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:05.525
- Dick, come on. We have to go.

01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:08.325
- Now!
- Oh!

01:16:08.425 --> 01:16:10.325
- Come on! Come on!
- I wasn't finished.

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:12.324
Quick! Hurry up! Just move it!

01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:14.324
Twenty seconds.

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:21.324
Steele, you're always
doing this to me!

01:16:23.424 --> 01:16:25.923
- You lose, Steele!

01:16:26.023 --> 01:16:27.924
I'm not through!
I'll be back!

01:16:28.023 --> 01:16:30.522
Maybe just tissue or a brain!

01:16:30.723 --> 01:16:33.522
- Open the door! I'm stuck in here!
- I'll be back!

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:37.023
- I'm going up, but you
and your whole world...

01:16:37.222 --> 01:16:39.222
are going down!

01:16:39.422 --> 01:16:42.021
- I'll be back, maybe without legs...
- Open the damn door!

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:46.021
- or some other minor organ.
- Wait! I don't want to miss the fireworks!

01:16:58.021 --> 01:17:00.121
How about a hand
for General Rancor?

01:17:02.221 --> 01:17:05.019
You're not through with me!

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.019
- Ah, well.

01:17:10.262 --> 01:17:12.348
- Houston, we have a problem.

01:17:29.618 --> 01:17:35.317
A man of intrigue
He lives for the thrill

01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:44.017
Always has places to go
and people to kill

01:17:46.217 --> 01:17:49.416
Danger is the game he plays

01:17:49.616 --> 01:17:53.616
And he holds every card

01:17:53.816 --> 01:17:56.815
'Cause if you wanna win

01:17:57.015 --> 01:18:00.315
You gotta spy hard

01:18:03.215 --> 01:18:08.415
A man of the world
so suave and discreet

01:18:11.215 --> 01:18:16.614
He trips over the women
piled up at his feet

01:18:20.114 --> 01:18:22.514
But evil's lurking

01:18:22.713 --> 01:18:27.213
So he's always on his guard

01:18:27.413 --> 01:18:30.413
'Cause if you're gonna spy

01:18:30.613 --> 01:18:35.812
You better spy hard

01:18:36.013 --> 01:18:39.413
He's always there

01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:44.211
When the chips
are beginning to fall

01:18:44.412 --> 01:18:47.812
He wouldn't care

01:18:48.012 --> 01:18:50.411
If they kicked him
and grabbed him

01:18:50.511 --> 01:18:52.411
And shot him
and stabbed him

01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:56.711
And nailed both his ears
to the wall

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:00.410
Facing death every day

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:05.411
Is a tough job for any man

01:19:05.611 --> 01:19:09.009
But his hours are flexible

01:19:09.209 --> 01:19:12.509
And he's got
a great dental plan

01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:17.808
By the way
if you walked in late

01:19:18.009 --> 01:19:22.009
Allow me to reiterate

01:19:22.209 --> 01:19:25.608
The name of this movie

01:19:25.808 --> 01:19:29.409
Was Spy Hard

01:19:29.608 --> 01:19:33.508
They called it Spy Hard

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:37.407
You just saw Spy Hard

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:43.307
It's the end of Spy Hard

01:17:16.518 --> 01:17:19.647
THE END

01:17:19.647 --> 01:17:29.031
