the old world during a holiday

46:13.918 --> 46:15.746

The idea of

came out of the writer's room,

come up with a challenge that
shows true partnership --

46:47.909 --> 46:49.736
you have to be in sync.

46:49.780 --> 46:53.349
And I think Rosita and her
partner actually pretty

46:53.392 --> 46:56.874
seamlessly figure out like,
let's talk to each other.

46:56.918 --> 46:58.702
-I got it!
-Let's take turns with

46:58.745 --> 47:00.573
the knife, like,
one person's gonna cover

47:00.617 --> 47:02.924
while the other person's got
the weapon, like,

47:02.967 --> 47:04.577
we're gonna move
sort of as a unit.

47:08.233 --> 47:11.628
Daryl is very, very good at
working with his friends,

47:11.671 --> 47:15.545
but his partner is a little bit
weaker than he is, like,

47:15.588 --> 47:17.373
terms of, like, skill set.

47:17.416 --> 47:20.158
And so I think, like, Daryl
wasn't expecting that,

47:20.202 --> 47:23.640
so when he's like, "You take the
knife, I'm just gonna, like,

47:23.683 --> 47:27.165
do my thing here," he's used to
working with people that you can

47:27.209 --> 47:30.386
give the knife and that's an act
of generosity, you know?

47:30.429 --> 47:32.388
And, like, they're gonna do
their thing, and he's gonna do

47:32.431 --> 47:34.346
his thing, and that's gonna work
out great.

47:36.261 --> 47:38.960

shoots the walker,

surprised, 'cause he's kinda

47:42.224 --> 47:45.444
like, "I was literally right
there," like, "I wasn't gonna

47:45.488 --> 47:46.924
let that guy die."

47:46.968 --> 47:49.057
But in Mercer's eyes, he's like,

47:49.100 --> 47:52.451
"You have failed the spirit of
this exercise."

47:52.495 --> 47:55.411
What I see is a guy that doesn't
know how to work with

47:55.454 --> 47:58.631
his partner and he just goes
lone wolf and does his own thing

47:58.675 --> 48:01.808
and doesn't communicate, so I
don't think either of them

48:01.852 --> 48:04.637
are really wrong, but they don't
see eye to eye yet.

You're used to handling things
on your own, I get that.

around here.

other up to win.

48:13.037 --> 48:16.693
This is the first time,
at the masquerade ball,

48:16.736 --> 48:19.043

only a certain segment
of society

48:21.916 --> 48:23.700
is welcome to this event.

48:23.743 --> 48:27.095
The celebration at the beginning
of the day was for everybody,

48:27.138 --> 48:30.185
and now this is the special
celebration for the people

48:30.228 --> 48:32.709
who are privileged enough
to be invited.

48:32.752 --> 48:35.233
There's something odd for our
people like Magna,

48:35.277 --> 48:37.540
who's working at the party,
to go like,

48:37.583 --> 48:40.412
"Wow, all that old stuff that we
thought we left behind,

48:40.456 --> 48:42.588
that we thought
didn't matter anymore,

48:42.632 --> 48:44.460
actually has always
mattered here,"

48:44.503 --> 48:47.637
and it's jarring for Magna,
who we had previously, like,

48:47.680 --> 48:50.466
established, like, when we
introduced her, she said that

48:50.509 --> 48:52.729
she used to be a waitress,
and it's like,

48:52.772 --> 48:55.079
here she is, serving food,
and I think, like,

48:55.123 --> 48:57.168
she never thought that
she would be

48:57.212 --> 48:58.865
knocked back down to that again.

48:58.909 --> 49:00.215

49:00.258 --> 49:02.086
who wants to be
amongst people again,

49:02.130 --> 49:04.697
she's right there, like,
you know, she's right there

come in.

"Well, I'm really

49:13.793 --> 49:16.405

this place,"

49:16.448 --> 49:18.494
like, "this is my doing," right?

49:18.537 --> 49:22.019
And I think, like, he really
wants the recognition!

49:22.063 --> 49:25.457
But we actually talked about
the fact that we think that,

49:25.501 --> 49:27.982
in this community,
somebody like Mercer,

49:28.025 --> 49:31.115
who is this super soldier, and,
like, the bright suit

49:31.159 --> 49:34.901
and all of that, he is kind of
a celebrity in the Commonwealth,

49:34.945 --> 49:38.122
and I think for Mercer, like,
truly, truly, truly,

49:38.166 --> 49:40.907
that is an uncomfortable place
to be,

49:40.951 --> 49:44.302
'cause I think he is somebody
who always imagined that he'd

49:44.346 --> 49:47.305
just be a public servant,
but for the Commonwealth,

49:47.349 --> 49:50.308
optics are important to them
and important to Pamela,

49:50.352 --> 49:54.095
and so he's accepted that that's
part of the way his job goes.

49:54.138 --> 49:56.706

this character Tyler Davis,

50:18.075 --> 50:20.164
who we met in the episode
"Splinter"

50:20.208 --> 50:21.948
in the season 10 extension,

50:21.992 --> 50:24.951
we were like, "Well,
what's his experience, like,

50:24.995 --> 50:27.389
after 'Splinter' happened,"
and, you know,

50:27.432 --> 50:30.348
he's a very complex character,
because, like,

50:30.392 --> 50:33.786
I don't feel particularly sorry
for him, like, all the time,

50:33.830 --> 50:37.138
'cause I'm like, man, he did
take this person hostage,

50:37.181 --> 50:39.966
he clearly doesn't have
the coping skills, right?

50:40.010 --> 50:42.969
He is an imperfect messenger,
and I think

50:43.013 --> 50:46.060
that's what makes it
easy to discount him.

we'll start to see that Connie,

50:56.592 --> 50:59.247
'cause she's got journalist
instincts, you know?

there's always an underbelly,

are gonna be pushing at --

question hanging.

51:38.460 --> 51:41.419

little secret room,

51:41.463 --> 51:45.206
then she's kinda seeing the
things that he's been painting,

51:45.249 --> 51:47.904

that's like,

"Huh, maybe there's more to this
than I thought."

running through her head

something for the audience
