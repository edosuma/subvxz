00:20.880 --> 00:23.480
They travelled back in time to get here.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.840
They travelled through time.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.840
Here. Professor Bill Ward, London.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.480
We should go find your professor.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.440
Won't you talk to me?

04:20.280 --> 04:21.880
I know that you blame me for everything.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.920
Maybe I should have
made different choices.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.600
Maybe I should've told you the truth
about your father.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.600
I didn't want to think about it.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.120
I couldn't.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.520
I just want you to know that everything
I did, I did because I love you.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.160
I'll always love you, no matter what.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.560
Mum?

05:14.880 --> 05:16.120
How did you know I was here?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.520
I knew you would want
to be close to Emily.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.280
Does she talk about me?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.600
Sacha, you have to
stop lying to yourself.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.520
She knows you killed Ash.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.760
We're going to be together.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.520
We're going to have a baby.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.440
Mum, I've seen it.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.320
I'll go first and cover you.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.080
Move fast.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
Come on.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Shit.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.360
No! He'll see you.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.680
Go...go...go...go!

10:57.880 --> 10:58.880
Go, go.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.080
We should wait to make sure
they've gone.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.360
I'll watch the stairs.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.080
You should rest.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.880
Are you okay?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.920
It would have been
Mum's birthday today.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.960
You were always better
at remembering birthdays than me.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.280
Do you ever think about how...

11:59.200 --> 12:02.400
...our lives would have been different
if Mum and Dad hadn't died?

12:04.440 --> 12:05.960
I used to.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.880
There didn't seem any point.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.360
There doesn't always have to be a point.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.920
Maybe you would have been the screw up
and I would've been the clever one.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Don't say that. You're not a screw up.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.520
I'll see if there's some food.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.800
You always change the subject
when I talk about the past.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.000
I don't always change the subject.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.760
When they died I didn't know what to do.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.000
I thought I had to be strong for you.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.840
I kept telling myself, "Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't cry."

12:51.880 --> 12:54.400
I pushed my feelings so far down...

12:57.920 --> 13:00.600
...until I stopped feeling
anything at all.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.600
See. It's me who's really screwed up.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.520
Then I guess that makes me
the smart one.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.280
I guess so.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.320
I'm coming with you.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.320
They've gone.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.880
I recognise you.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.680
Is it you?

33:03.120 --> 33:04.120
How are you?

33:05.160 --> 33:06.280
You feeling okay?

33:06.480 --> 33:07.640
I'm just tired.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.640
You can rest now.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.320
We found him.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.160
The virus is gone.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.960
You think we had a wasted journey?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.760
It's starting to feel that way.
