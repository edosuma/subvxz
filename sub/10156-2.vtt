02:12.760 --> 02:14.603
Mum, what do you want?

02:14.680 --> 02:16.728
<i>I didn't think you'd pick up.</i>

02:16.800 --> 02:18.165
Listen, you know the deal.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.530
I call you, you don't call me here.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.371
Are you ashamed to talk to me?

02:25.040 --> 02:26.963
Listen, I don't have time to talk to you.
I'm going out.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.604
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
- It doesn't matter.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.290
Some... Somewhere on the island.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.251
<i>I bet the weather there's just fine.</i>

02:38.520 --> 02:40.761
- How's Billy?
<i>- As if you care.</i>

02:42.600 --> 02:45.729
<i>They say he doesn't even
ask about you any more.</i>

02:47.360 --> 02:49.362
There's more money coming
at the end of the month.

02:50.520 --> 02:54.002
That's why you called me, right?
I'm putting the phone down.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.684
<i>Just remember one thing, honey.</i>

02:57.280 --> 02:59.044
You're nothing but a dirty whore.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.400
Just a minute.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.600
Come in.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.441
Oh.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.727
Hey, I thought you were your father.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.288
- Dad says we need to go.
- I know.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.441
I'm coming.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.124
You just wait outside.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.361
OK.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.486
- How do I look?
- You look very pretty.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.841
Come on.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.926
Go.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.010
I misunderstood him.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.527
The fact remains,
you and paella do not get on.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.965
To the point where,

04:02.040 --> 04:04.805
basically, we're out $7 million
because Corky doesn't like paella.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.564
No, that's one version, chief.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.721
What do you mean, "That's one version"?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.087
That is the version. It's a matter of record.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.730
You chaps better go on ahead, I think.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.004
There you are.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.325
I was starting to think
you'd drowned in the bath.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.366
Baby, I have terrible news.
I have a new date for tonight.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.161
He's young and he's seriously hot.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.602
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.451
All right, come on. Let's go, I'm starving.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.522
- You gonna come with me, Dans?
- OK.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.001
- Are we taking the boat?
- Yes, we are, sir.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.445
You might even drive, if you're lucky.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.966
Yes, you lot. Come on, then.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.041
Hello.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.243
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.651
- Hi.
- Jorge, how are you?

05:29.720 --> 05:31.324
Mr Roper, how are you?

05:31.440 --> 05:32.851
Very well, thank you.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.924
- Are you still doing the shellfish soup?
- Yes, of course!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.206
The recipe lives on.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.441
We'll have that to start.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.091
All except for Major Corkoran
who will have the paella.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.844
Hi Herr, how are you?

05:42.920 --> 05:44.285
Ja, ja, very good to see you.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.964
Very good to see you.
Hi, darling, how are you?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.963
- Fine.
- Good to see you.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.121
- Very well.
- Good to see you again.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.249
I think it is mad.
No, I think it's actually hypocritical.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.688
But if you like eating venison,
you ought to be able to kill a stag.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.489
I think if you're willing to kill a stag,

05:57.560 --> 06:00.723
you have to be willing to admit
you just like killing stags.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.201
Thank you, Jed, I now officially love you.

06:03.280 --> 06:08.366
Chief, is it OK to baptise the princeling
in the ways of the grape?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.290
I think that's a yes, isn't it?

06:13.360 --> 06:16.284
Dicky, will you please tell Jed,
I don't have "blood lust." I don't.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.646
Beautiful fizzy liquid.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.200
You've got so many lusts, Sandy.
That's why we love you, isn't it?

06:20.280 --> 06:23.648
Give the stag an MI6, Sandy.
Then I'm interested.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.083
- Give him an MI6? Bollocks! Sell him.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait...

06:29.080 --> 06:30.889
What do you think, Daniel?

06:31.560 --> 06:33.847
He likes it.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.445
- Oh dear!
- See what you've done?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.521
What if he turns out like me, boss?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.210
I can see this is a...

06:38.280 --> 06:40.248
This a dark, dark road
you've embarked upon.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.644
Thank you, Corky.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.210
- What do you want?
- What do you think?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.367
All right. That's all right.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.851
Go on, then.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.880
Come on.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.088
- Where are we going?
- It's a secret.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.447
Where are you going?

06:57.520 --> 06:58.726
You drink my wine.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.609
You steal my woman.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.604
Proud of you, Danny.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.731
Bring her back in one piece, will you?

07:07.800 --> 07:10.041
- Lord Langbourne is a snob, basically.
- What?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.407
Three generations of Eton,
or you're not on the map.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.406
I'm only one generation, Sandy.
So what does that make me?

07:16.360 --> 07:19.330
You're paying the bill, Dicky.
Which means you are the map.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.686
To Ricardo!

07:22.760 --> 07:24.046
- Cheers.
- Good health.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.487
Slimy, bloody arse-licking creep.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.164
Excuse me, small person.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.685
Out of my way.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.889
May I have this dance?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.645
- Thank you, so much.
- Of course.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.404
Right, let's see what you've got.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.086
OK, OK, that's fine.
And again and you go round.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.525
Good, good.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.685
She wants to dance.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.410
Come on then, Corkoran.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.847
Right, come on. I'll do it.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.081
Tear it up, tear it up.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.929
Oh, yeah. Come on, baby.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.287
There you go. Right and left.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.451
- That's it.
- It's time to put the children to bed.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.806
Oh, no...

08:31.880 --> 08:33.530
Thank you, great.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.365
- Guys, good night. Sleep well.
- Come on, ignore him.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.770
Be good.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.325
Dance with me?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.842
You have Chateaubriand
every single day.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.284
There's been no point at which you go,

08:43.360 --> 08:46.807
"Oh, for God's sake,
if I eat that I will vomit?"

08:49.800 --> 08:51.211
Corky has smelt the...

08:51.320 --> 08:53.084
Nobody move! Nobody move!
This is a robbery!

08:53.160 --> 08:54.924
Guns down! Guns down!

08:55.000 --> 08:56.490
On the floor! Guns down!

08:56.560 --> 08:58.403
Why have you got guns?
You police? You police?

08:58.480 --> 09:00.960
No, no. They're with me.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.451
Put the guns on the floor! On the floor!

09:02.520 --> 09:04.329
Roper, please. God damn it, Roper!

09:04.400 --> 09:06.607
Frisky, Tabby, do what he says.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.641
On the floor.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.771
Everyone stay very, very calm.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.282
We're going to do exactly
what this gentleman wants us to do

09:18.360 --> 09:19.725
and everything is gonna be fine.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.606
You a rich man?

09:22.480 --> 09:24.050
Yes, I am a rich man.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.768
I'm gonna give you all the money we have.
I'm gonna give you wallets, jewellery.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.251
We'll give you anything
in the restaurant till.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.448
And then you're gonna leave. Right?

09:31.520 --> 09:33.170
Jorge, will you check the till, please?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.891
- Tell him no alarms.
- No alarms, Jorge.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.121
And slowly.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.050
Everybody stay very, very calm.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.246
Dad!

09:41.320 --> 09:42.890
All right, just keep looking at me.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.007
Back off! Back off!

09:44.080 --> 09:45.844
Tabby, Tabby, Tabby, step back...

09:46.280 --> 09:47.406
This your boy?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.250
Yes, he's my boy.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.448
Danny, it's fine.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.887
Just keep looking at me. It's fine.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.689
Jewellery! Wallets!

09:56.760 --> 09:58.171
just give them
everything we have.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.321
OK.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.401
In the bag!

10:00.840 --> 10:02.410
It's all right, Danny.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.641
That's all?

10:05.720 --> 10:08.007
Where is the real money? That's shit, man!

10:08.160 --> 10:09.730
Where is the rest?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.211
We can send for some money.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.008
- How much do we have, Corks?
- About 100.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.890
There you are, $100,000.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.803
We can have it here in 15 minutes.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.484
All you have to do is let the boy go.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.125
It's all right, Danny.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.370
We contact you.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.249
We contact you.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.641
You bring the money to us.
We give you back the boy.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.484
No, no, no. We will give you money.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.324
We will give you money,
but you have to leave the boy here.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.401
We contact you!

10:33.480 --> 10:34.561
No, no, no.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.404
On the floor, on the ground!

10:36.480 --> 10:38.608
- No, you take me instead!
- We contact you! Back off!

10:38.680 --> 10:40.808
Down on the ground!

10:40.880 --> 10:43.167
Everybody on the ground!

10:43.240 --> 10:45.322
Everybody on the ground!

10:45.400 --> 10:46.606
- We contact you.
- Dad!

10:46.680 --> 10:48.728
Dad! Dad!

10:50.920 --> 10:52.160
All right, all right, all right...

10:52.240 --> 10:54.720
- Stay there, or the boy dies!
- Dad!

10:54.880 --> 10:57.042
Dad!

10:57.120 --> 10:58.645
On the ground! On the ground!

10:59.080 --> 11:01.686
- Down on the floor!
- Get down! Shut up!

11:08.360 --> 11:09.691
Who's in there? Who's in there?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.206
Good boy. Good boy. Good boy.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.649
Mr Burr always wanted
to come to the Swiss Alps.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.563
He likes the peace and quiet, does Mr Burr.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.240
You don't?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.848
All this snow and silence
makes me want to scream.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.206
- Don't worry, I'm not going to.
- OK.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.647
How long have you been together?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.601
- Twenty years, come November.
- Wow.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.681
Congratulations.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.808
It's marriage, Jonathan.
It's not a state of bliss.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.606
Any children?

12:17.960 --> 12:19.644
First and last.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.963
So, there's no mention of Cairo
on your professional CV, I checked.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.089
Yeah, I... I took it off after I left.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.241
Why?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.120
I had to.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.521
So, if Roper checked with Meisters
for a biography,

12:39.600 --> 12:42.126
- Cairo wouldn't come up?
- No.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.123
What about Freddie Hamid?

12:45.200 --> 12:49.410
To him, I was just a man in a uniform.
He never knew my name.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.121
So, just a little bit of airbrushing
and you'd be clean?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.166
Clean?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.408
Do you handle cash in that hotel of yours?

12:59.480 --> 13:01.562
Yeah, sometimes.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.086
Suppose you stole some of it, or all of it.
Would anyone notice straightaway?

13:07.480 --> 13:09.209
Not if I was clever about it.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.365
Ah, well, luckily you are clever, Jonathan.
Cos I checked.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.840
Did you?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.764
Course you did.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.482
Don't get many visitors here, do you?

13:28.440 --> 13:29.487
No.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.602
Ooh, T. E. Lawrence...

13:36.680 --> 13:37.886
Of Arabia.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.603
The lonely genius
who wished only to be a number.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.606
Would you put that back, please?

13:44.680 --> 13:45.841
Whose initials are these?

13:47.480 --> 13:48.766
They're my father's.

13:48.840 --> 13:49.966
- It's private.
- Oh.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.567
Sorry, I didn't realise
it meant that much to you.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.571
Yes, you did.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.211
He was undercover in Belfast,
wasn't he, your father?

14:01.760 --> 14:02.921
Yes, he was.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.401
- Same regiment as you?
- Yeah.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.207
I read that they had
to put his uniform back on

14:08.280 --> 14:10.203
before they buried him.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.088
What do you want, Ms Burr?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.490
I want to make you an offer.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.603
Come and work for me.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.842
And afterwards, when it's all over,
I will look after you.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.528
Resettlement, new name,
new identity, new life.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.087
An offer to do what?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.642
To bring down Richard Roper.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.484
I've spent 10 years of my life
going after that man.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.164
I've had microphones up his arse,

14:44.240 --> 14:46.561
I've had GCHQ tapping every bloody email.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.766
I've had 1,000 satellites overflying him
and I can't get close to him.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.046
And do you know why?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.406
Cos he's too smart.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.529
But that'll change.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.491
I want to put you inside his operation.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.769
I will give you a legend
as thick as your arm.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.124
You'll be in so deep,
you'll worry that you'll never get out of it.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.570
There's not a scrap of you
that won't get used,

15:08.640 --> 15:11.166
there's not an hour that will go by
you won't be scared.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.083
But you will nail him.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.406
You will nail him for Sophie Alekan.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.565
You will nail him for your country.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.166
And you will nail him
for the man that owned that book.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.522
Or you can go back to
the hotel of non-existence.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.125
It's up to you.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.084
I think he's gonna do it.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.200
What do you need?

15:46.280 --> 15:49.090
I need to give him a criminal history,
something for Roper to find.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.969
It's gotta be West Country
and it needs to be real.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.690
I need the Home Office on board.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.411
And I need you to take out
at least three Devon police officers,

15:55.480 --> 15:57.482
take them to lunch,
get them to play the game.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.565
No half measures then, eh?

15:59.800 --> 16:03.441
And not a word to the River House, Rex.
Do you understand me? Not a word.

16:05.760 --> 16:10.368
I do hope I'm not about to regret the
soft spot that I have for you, Angela.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.044
All right.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.008
This is Rob Singhal, my deputy.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.406
Hello.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.921
You up for it? You sure, are you?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.161
Yeah.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.089
Right, well, sit down and have
a cup of tea, for God's sake.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.161
You're making me feel nervous.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.046
Thanks.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.607
No.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.401
All you've said so far is yes.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.121
- Do you want me to say no?
- Well, now would be the moment.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.010
Now, or forever hold your peace.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.051
You're too bloody perfect, Jonathan Pine,
that's your trouble.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.009
I don't want you perfect.
Go on, have a biscuit, eat it.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.201
You are gonna put on
the performance of your life.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.567
There is half a psychopath
lurking in there, Jonathan.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.803
I want you to find him and stick to him.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.291
Once you get down to Devon,

18:24.360 --> 18:27.569
you are the world's second worst man,
first place already taken.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.961
There is no right or wrong
for you down there.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.923
Do you hear me? It's all me, me, me.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.090
Don't give anyone an inch.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.960
Anyone pisses you off, you smack 'em.
Anyone crosses you, God help them.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.727
I want you to scare the shit out of everyone
and that includes me.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.201
Richard Roper must know
that you're in the same league as him.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.767
Laws don't apply to him,
and they don't apply to you either.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.531
He sees that, we get him.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.166
He comes to the table,
we get him over a barrel and we skewer him.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.929
Are you comfortable with that?

18:58.480 --> 18:59.561
Yes.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.451
Right, this is our insurance.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.287
To say that you jumped, we didn't push you.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.567
<i>Tell me what you saw
when you got to the cottage.</i>

19:36.720 --> 19:40.884
<i>Uh, the...
The kitchen was a mess...</i>

19:42.960 --> 19:45.770
And there is blood on the... On the floor.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.324
Did he kill him?

20:16.080 --> 20:18.162
- Hi.
- You all right?

20:19.280 --> 20:23.080
I've, um, taken Rosum's Cottage.
I was told to leave the rent here.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.245
I'll be here for a while.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.488
- Is this your place?
- No, it's my mum's.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.847
- I'm just looking after it.
- Right.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.769
- You're from up country?
- Yeah, that's right.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.611
What you doing down here?

20:44.240 --> 20:46.686
He's a big lad.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.241
Is he yours?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.566
Yeah.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.809
Well...

20:54.520 --> 20:56.284
What was the name?

20:59.320 --> 21:00.924
Jack Linden.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.731
Who are you?

21:56.040 --> 21:57.371
Get out.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.291
- Nobody even lives here.
- Well, I do now.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.410
What do you want?

22:57.360 --> 22:58.850
- Police, right?
- Nah.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.250
Whoever you are, get lost.

23:02.680 --> 23:05.889
- I've got an offer for you.
- I'm not interested.

23:08.880 --> 23:09.927
You deaf?

23:10.320 --> 23:11.765
I told you to get lost.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.889
Now, listen to me, OK?

23:18.960 --> 23:22.282
I don't know who you're buying off,
but things have changed.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.806
I have a delivery coming
in a few weeks' time.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.609
You'll buy it off me now, OK?

23:26.680 --> 23:27.681
Piss off.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.531
I would advise

23:31.600 --> 23:33.648
a different business language from now on.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.481
OK?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.684
No!

23:41.200 --> 23:42.281
Try it.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.120
Try it.

23:46.680 --> 23:47.727
No!

23:49.640 --> 23:52.246
Shh, Shh, shh, shh...

24:09.320 --> 24:10.810
Who was that?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.086
You OK?

24:23.640 --> 24:26.086
<i>Now, let? try a little
thought experiment here.</i>

24:27.040 --> 24:30.487
<i>Think of all the things you own,
clothes, house, car,</i>

24:30.680 --> 24:32.728
<i>and ask yourself what part of all that</i>

24:32.800 --> 24:35.849
<i>did not depend on commerce
and free movement of capital?</i>

24:37.760 --> 24:40.366
<i>For the benefit of
the hard of thinking in the room,</i>

24:40.440 --> 24:43.205
<i>I'll give you the answer. The answer is none.</i>

24:43.280 --> 24:44.281
<i>None.</i>

24:46.200 --> 24:51.411
<i>My Safe Haven project for refugees is not
funded out of love, or a bleeding heart.</i>

24:51.480 --> 24:53.721
<i>I do it because it benefits me</i>

24:53.800 --> 24:55.882
<i>to have the communities
in which I wish to operate</i>

24:55.960 --> 24:57.121
<i>sympathetic to my interests.</i>

24:59.080 --> 25:02.641
<i>The truth, which no one
dares admit these days,</i>

25:03.920 --> 25:07.845
<i>is that only by freeing capital
do you free the world.</i>

25:18.400 --> 25:19.561
Right.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.241
Hey.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.327
Pint of Blue Anchor, please.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.005
That's him.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.811
Cheers.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.849
- Hey.
- You all right?

26:10.920 --> 26:12.081
Yeah.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.243
My mother says you want mineral water.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.884
Uh, I don't think so.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.047
Oh.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.330
Well, I've brought them now.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.561
- Coffee?
- I wouldn't say no.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.889
I Googled you, jack Linden.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.763
And what did you find?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.365
Bugger all.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.005
So you like it here, do you?

26:54.960 --> 26:56.564
All on your own?

26:57.480 --> 26:59.960
- What you do here all day?
- Bit of cooking.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.730
- I can cook.
- Oh, yeah?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.450
Mmm. I was good.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.767
I won prizes. I was gonna be a famous chef.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.401
- Well, what happened?
- I stopped.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.001
Why?

27:14.680 --> 27:17.081
Cos I married a loser, had a brat,
and screwed up my life.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.529
Right, um... And the father is...

27:22.600 --> 27:23.601
No, he ain't...

27:23.680 --> 27:26.809
He ain't been Charlie's father
since he was three days old.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.008
He came to the hospital with a box
of Cadbury's milk chocolates

27:29.080 --> 27:31.731
and tuckered all the nice ones.
He couldn't wait to flee.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.448
- Where to?
- Don't ask me.

27:36.440 --> 27:39.284
- Is he abroad or...
- Tom Quince?

27:39.920 --> 27:41.729
Sorry, say again.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.610
Tom Quince. It's Charlie's father's name.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.841
Nah, he's never had a passport in his life.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.328
He's probably somewhere round Bude,
smoking a ton of pot,

27:51.400 --> 27:52.925
and trying to sleep with the weekend talent.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.810
It's a great pleasure
to introduce the chief officer

28:52.160 --> 28:55.448
at the US Directorate
of Defense Trade Controls,

28:55.520 --> 28:56.726
Joel Steadman.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.131
Firstly, gentlemen...

28:59.680 --> 29:01.648
- And lady...
- Sorry.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.529
I want to thank you all
for inviting me to London

29:03.600 --> 29:05.125
to share a little of what I know

29:05.200 --> 29:07.680
about the global arms trade
in the 21 st century

29:07.760 --> 29:08.761
and how to confront it.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.127
There's about 3,000 years
of wisdom in this room.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.521
I represent about six weeks of it.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.490
But hell, those odds never
stopped an American before.

29:17.800 --> 29:18.881
Now, there's two philosophies

29:18.960 --> 29:21.042
on how to confront
internationals arms smuggling.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.248
You can exploit, or you can enforce.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.084
Now, I'm an enforcer and I'll tell you why.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.886
You go down the exploitation path
and this is what happens.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.731
You identify a bad guy, you watch him,

29:30.800 --> 29:32.086
get all kinds of dirt on him.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.766
Then you approach him,
and then what do you do?

29:34.840 --> 29:36.410
Well, then you recruit him.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.562
You recruit him to get to the next guy,

29:38.640 --> 29:40.563
then you watch him, then you recruit him,

29:40.640 --> 29:42.165
and so on, and so forth.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.720
And pretty soon the lines get blurred,
your enemy becomes your friend.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.730
And hey, the devil has
all the best lines, right?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.849
Now, I'm an enforcer.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.730
I go after someone and I bring 'em down.

29:54.280 --> 29:59.207
And the reason why I'm here today,
is to ask you folks for a little help.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.169
- Joel.
- Mr Dromgoole.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.480
- Excellent to see you.
- Thank you.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.681
You know these guys?

30:07.760 --> 30:08.966
Palfrey.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.963
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.765
I enjoyed your speech.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.410
Well, let's keep the
channels open at all times.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.807
Absolutely. Particularly when
it comes to the Middle East.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.086
Anything you have at all.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.049
I have money and people
ready to work with you.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.646
Sure will, Geoffrey.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.844
- Speak to you later.
- Thank you.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.041
- Joel.
- Ah.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.205
- Good to have you with us.
- Nice to see you.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.441
Angela.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.451
Hello, Joel.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.606
What do you think of the ale?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.005
Jury's out.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.687
I see, uh, you're not drinking.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.764
You didn't tell me you were flying in.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.363
You didn't tell me something
a lot more important than that.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.088
Why were you in Madrid two weeks ago?

31:14.840 --> 31:18.447
It's an operation called, "Limpet."
We're going after Richard Onslow Roper.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.003
His people are meeting
with a Spanish lawyer in Madrid.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.081
Juan Apostol.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.362
Yeah. Also known as, "Apo."

31:25.800 --> 31:27.962
We think there's a new deal in the pipeline.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.931
But you can't get close.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.451
Can anyone?

31:35.320 --> 31:37.641
They're phone records
from the mobile phone of Lance Corkoran,

31:37.720 --> 31:39.370
Roper's front man.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.886
They show calls to London,
Beirut and Madrid.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.610
How the hell did you get this?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.809
I've got a new asset.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.326
I want to get him on the inside
of Roper's set-up.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.162
You got any idea how dangerous that is?

31:55.200 --> 31:59.489
- Does River House know about this?
- It's got to be a church mouse operation.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.731
Then why did you call me?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.411
Cos I need your money.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.441
Joel, I'm on my own in this,
and I don't like it.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.324
I'm doing something
no one else has done before

32:13.400 --> 32:16.244
and I'm scared shitless, I need a friend.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.209
I've got some more stuff coming
on Tuesday night.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.566
You got the money?

32:39.680 --> 32:40.841
Good.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.009
- Hi.
- Harlow.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.400
Right.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.851
From London.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.728
Is that what you wanted?

33:25.280 --> 33:26.486
Well?

33:31.440 --> 33:32.566
Yeah.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.407
It's a funny old gig, this one.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.810
I shall expect a lavish funeral.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.644
I'm sure they'll do what they can.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.924
Well, then, Tom Quince.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.565
Are you ready?

34:04.320 --> 34:07.642
We need to wait for the stuff.
It'll come and it'll all be OK.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.043
Yea h, it'll be OK.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.005
It'll be OK.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.846
It's gonna be OK.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.844
Now, get out!

34:40.360 --> 34:41.521
What?

35:34.160 --> 35:35.605
Jack?

35:40.400 --> 35:41.686
Jack?

35:59.520 --> 36:01.204
<i>Tell me what you saw
when you got to the cottage.</i>

36:03.320 --> 36:06.051
<i>The kitchen was a mess...</i>

36:07.520 --> 36:10.091
And there was blood on the floor.

36:10.440 --> 36:12.010
Here you go.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.771
Did he kill him?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.282
<i>The man he attacked in the pub?</i>

36:21.360 --> 36:22.850
<i>Yes.</i>

36:23.200 --> 36:24.964
<i>Why did you go to the cottage?</i>

36:25.040 --> 36:26.451
<i>I was fetching empties.</i>

36:27.000 --> 36:29.606
- Had you been there before?
- Yeah, once or twice.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.361
<i>- Why?</i>
<i>- To deliver for my mother, that's all.</i>

36:35.480 --> 36:37.642
<i>Did he ever
mention his previous life?</i>

36:38.680 --> 36:40.444
- No.
- Ever mention Switzerland?

36:40.640 --> 36:42.085
No, why?

36:42.160 --> 36:44.640
- Did he say he was leaving?
- No.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.723
Name Jonathan Pine mean anything to you?

36:47.360 --> 36:48.361
No.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.244
So he never told you his real name?

36:50.560 --> 36:54.121
No, he said his name was Linden.
Jack Linden.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.848
He never told you who he was?

36:58.560 --> 37:00.324
He never said who he was.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.007
Who's in there? Who's in there?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.291
Go. Go back to your mother.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.606
Go.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.326
Go!

37:47.880 --> 37:49.086
You bastard.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.083
You were supposed not to hurt him!

37:51.160 --> 37:52.605
It needed to look real.

37:55.880 --> 37:56.961
You want it real?

37:57.920 --> 38:00.571
I'll show you real!

38:09.120 --> 38:11.122
We'll show you real!

38:20.480 --> 38:23.245
Oh, Jesus! Danny. Danny!
just wait here...

38:23.480 --> 38:24.811
- Come on, big man.
- Danny!

38:24.960 --> 38:26.450
- He's all right.
- Oh God!

38:26.600 --> 38:28.011
Danny!

38:28.080 --> 38:29.206
Oh!

38:29.520 --> 38:30.567
Are you all right?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.245
What happened?

38:33.440 --> 38:35.602
They ran off.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.682
He scared them. He saved me.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.130
Who saved you? What...

38:40.200 --> 38:41.406
Who is he?
Where the hell has he come from?

38:41.480 --> 38:43.244
He's our seasonal sous-chef from England.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.805
He was working in that kitchen.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.651
We need to call the police.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.040
Chief, we doing medical attention?

38:52.960 --> 38:54.325
I know him.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.691
What's his name?

38:57.320 --> 39:00.403
Thomas Quince. He's from Devon in England.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.364
No, he's bloody not.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.649
You're Pine from Switzerland.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.766
What are you doing here?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.808
Sandy, we need to call the police.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.881
No police.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.369
No police.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.601
No, hold on, Jorge.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.603
Just hold on a second.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.206
How's his pulse, Frisky?

39:22.280 --> 39:25.841
Yeah, it's quite sporting, chief,
all things considered.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.762
You hearing me, Pine?

39:29.560 --> 39:31.881
We're gonna get you out of here.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.004
Corky, get the boats ready, will you?

39:34.120 --> 39:35.201
And call the hospital.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.044
- Which one?
- Well, our one.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.202
Not the death trap on the main drag.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.645
Tell them to get ready to operate,
and get hold of that Israeli fellow.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.721
Dr Shimon.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.280
Drag him away from whatever
Russian party he's currently at.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.566
You must have given them
the fright of their lives.

39:51.160 --> 39:54.243
No police. No police.

39:55.960 --> 39:56.961
All right, Jorge,

39:57.080 --> 39:59.048
I think we can keep this between us,
can't we?

40:00.400 --> 40:03.165
I'll pay for any damage done,
Corky can sort the bill.

40:03.960 --> 40:07.851
Anyone you want us to call?
A girlfriend? Family?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.764
Still alone, are we?

40:15.440 --> 40:16.521
Well.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.087
We're gonna take care of you.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.531
Thank you.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.601
Hey.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.201
Hey.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.327
Any sign of him? What went wrong?

40:46.400 --> 40:47.731
Let me get this.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.326
He went off-script. Way off-script.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.129
He broke an agent's arm in three places.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.411
What's he playing at?

40:54.480 --> 40:56.084
He said he wanted it real.
So they made it real.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.605
They think they might have killed him.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.366
What do you mean killed him?

40:59.440 --> 41:02.887
Roper didn't call the cops,
so we don't know where he is.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.007
God damn it, Angela.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.408
This thing was perfectly choreographed.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.926
He knew exactly what we had to do.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.161
Hector.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.641
Do you remember Angela Burr
from Baghdad?

41:18.720 --> 41:21.200
- Sure do. Welcome, ma'am.
- You two still working together?

41:21.320 --> 41:23.482
Yeah.
No one is more mystified by that than me.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.050
Sir, you should hear this.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.121
Come on, sit down.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.009
Corkoran is calling a number
in Gloucestershire

41:28.480 --> 41:30.005
from his mobile phone.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.331
<i>Tony? Lance Corkoran here.</i>

41:33.920 --> 41:36.605
<i>Pressing matter, I'm afraid.
Chief needs your good offices.</i>

41:37.800 --> 41:39.165
<i>Got a pen?</i>

41:40.800 --> 41:43.724
<i>The name is Pine, like the tree.</i>

41:44.720 --> 41:46.643
<i>First name, Jonathan.</i>

41:48.160 --> 41:51.448
Goes under the name of Thomas Quince,
like the fruit.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.962
Head-to-toe background check, all avenues.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.041
All perfectly mum.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.088
<i>360 degrees. Ta.</i>

41:58.200 --> 42:00.567
Well, he's alive.
They wouldn't check on a dead man.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.406
Rob Singhal, IEA.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.005
<i>Rob, I want you to put his name out.</i>

42:19.080 --> 42:20.127
<i>Splash it large.</i>

42:20.200 --> 42:22.601
I want an international warrant
for the arrest of Thomas Quince,

42:23.520 --> 42:25.249
Jonathan Pine, jack Linden.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.811
Er, murder, multiple theft...

42:27.040 --> 42:29.247
<i>Dope-running,
obtaining a false passport,</i>

42:29.320 --> 42:30.526
<i>and identity theft.</i>

42:30.720 --> 42:32.245
And whatever else you can think of.

42:32.320 --> 42:35.608
- All right? Do it now.
- He's crossed the bridge.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.121
Yeah, now we're burning it.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.082
Thomas.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.805
Thomas, I'm not sure if you can hear me.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.082
They say your face is mending well.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.766
But you've also cracked several ribs.

44:35.880 --> 44:38.087
You're so brave, but you're gonna be fine.

44:38.160 --> 44:41.164
Dr Shimon's the very best,
otherwise Roper wouldn't use him.

44:44.680 --> 44:46.842
Listen, is there anyone you want us to call?

44:46.920 --> 44:48.126
A loved one?

44:49.160 --> 44:51.606
When you were sleeping,
you mentioned someone called Sophie.

44:51.680 --> 44:52.920
Should we call her?

44:54.920 --> 44:57.127
Just raise your finger if you can't speak.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.928
Roper is away on business,
but he'll be back soon

45:03.000 --> 45:04.240
and he can't wait to see you.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.003
Where am I?

45:16.560 --> 45:18.801
Are you awake?

45:19.440 --> 45:22.922
My father says I'm to thank you
for saving my life.

45:24.360 --> 45:28.285
I'm sorry I ran away from the table.
I won't do it again.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.644
Do you want me to read to you about squid?

45:51.640 --> 45:54.166
"This slow-moving alien-like squid

45:54.720 --> 45:57.405
<i>"lives at depths of up to 200 metres."</i>

46:17.880 --> 46:19.769
Piss off, would you, Frisky, old love?

46:25.280 --> 46:26.805
Well, that's a better colour.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.008
Lovely deep purple.

46:29.400 --> 46:33.007
Better than the blue baboon look of last week.
And sitting up.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.802
Dare one hope, we're on the mend?

46:36.520 --> 46:38.409
Actually, I'd like to go soon, please.

46:38.480 --> 46:39.845
Absolutely, old boy.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.162
Soon as the chief gets back.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.687
What do I call you, by the way?

46:47.040 --> 46:49.168
When I was doing the forms at the hospital,

46:49.400 --> 46:51.050
I had a conundrum.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.724
"Well," I thought, "This is a bit rum!"

46:53.080 --> 46:57.051
"Is he a Thomas Quince,
or is he a Jonathan Pine?"

46:57.960 --> 47:00.167
So I put Mordechai Phillips.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.521
To this day, I've no idea why.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.324
Mind if I smoke?

47:07.120 --> 47:09.600
Smoke ourselves, do we? In better times?

47:10.400 --> 47:11.561
A bit.

47:15.080 --> 47:17.845
Nothing like a fag, when you're cooking.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.809
Do you want one now?

47:22.320 --> 47:23.685
No, thanks.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.727
Bloody good grub
at that place you were working.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.050
Were those saucy mussels all your work?

47:31.320 --> 47:34.324
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, I am blown away.

47:35.400 --> 47:37.209
And did you cook at that Swiss hotel?

47:37.280 --> 47:39.681
Or merely rob the place?

47:42.040 --> 47:43.565
It's a tricky one, you see.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.446
The chief is a stickler for detail,

47:46.520 --> 47:49.967
so we called the Meisters Hotel
to ask for a reference

47:50.240 --> 47:54.802
and it turns out you are nothing more
than a common thief.

47:55.520 --> 47:59.241
40,000 euros swiped from the safe,
the police called,

47:59.680 --> 48:02.126
Herr Meister's positively seething.

48:03.560 --> 48:06.131
No wonder the chief has
a few questions to ask.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.446
But he says they can wait
until you're better.

48:09.560 --> 48:14.930
Although, I'm not so sure
we're quite as poorly as we're making out.

48:17.560 --> 48:21.610
In fact, I'm not sure at all about you, Pine.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.168
I think you might be stringing us along.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.481
Hmm?

48:30.320 --> 48:31.651
And if that's the case,

48:32.200 --> 48:33.884
when you're better,

48:33.960 --> 48:35.564
I will hood you,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.890
and hang you up by those lovely ankles

48:39.280 --> 48:43.251
until the truth falls out of you by gravity.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.491
Toodle-oo.

48:49.600 --> 48:52.331
Frisky, piss off back in again, would you?

48:53.640 --> 48:56.644
Make sure our valued guest
doesn't try and make a run for it.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.520
You know the best way
to make a bloke talk?

49:05.080 --> 49:06.923
Fizzy drink treatment.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.241
Up the nose.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.765
Bung the mouth.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.289
And if you've got a funnel handy,

49:13.840 --> 49:15.683
oh, it's even better.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.804
Hits you right in the switchboard.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.043
It's bloody diabolical.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.082
- Apo, how are you?
- Good to see you.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.242
- Very good to see you.
- Have a seat.

49:43.320 --> 49:46.130
Thank you, very much. So, have you eaten?

50:14.640 --> 50:17.211
Are you sure you know your lines?

50:17.280 --> 50:18.930
I'll do my best.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.962
So, tell us about Limpet.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.248
Well, Limpet is an ongoing
anti-arms operation

50:24.320 --> 50:25.606
based in Washington.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.808
Standard tracer op.
It's been running about a year.

50:27.880 --> 50:29.086
Who are you going after?

50:29.160 --> 50:31.766
Richard Onslow Roper, Director of Ironlast,

50:31.840 --> 50:33.330
and we think a lot more on the side.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.046
That wouldn't surprise me.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.043
I came here to see if
there were opportunities

50:37.120 --> 50:39.202
for mutual collaboration
and intelligence sharing.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.085
Angela was happy to come on board,

50:41.160 --> 50:44.323
and I was hoping you folks
would kind of do the same.

50:44.920 --> 50:47.366
All right. Where are you at, at the moment?

50:47.560 --> 50:49.722
Well, it's been going pretty well.
Wouldn't you say?

50:49.840 --> 50:51.080
- Yeah.
- Um...

50:51.160 --> 50:53.640
We have some photographs here
of a meeting that took place in Madrid

50:53.720 --> 50:56.451
between Alexander Langbourne,
Roper's money man

50:56.520 --> 50:58.966
and a Spanish lawyer, Juan Apostol.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.442
It's possible they were discussing
a future arms deal.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.450
Did you get any audio on that?

51:03.800 --> 51:04.926
Unfortunately not, no.

51:05.360 --> 51:09.206
So it's possible they were discussing
their children's Christmas parties?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.001
Well...

51:12.080 --> 51:14.924
What about on the ground?
Got anyone close to Roper?

51:15.640 --> 51:17.404
Um, not right now, no.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.405
In development?

51:20.040 --> 51:22.327
Getting someone on the inside, Harry,
that's a long game.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.448
- What I want from you...
- Let me stop you there, Joel.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.166
Angela runs her own modest
enforcement agency,

51:28.240 --> 51:29.810
and she can do what she likes.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.485
Roper is an obsession of hers.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.364
He was when she was with us
here at the River,

51:33.440 --> 51:35.169
I suspect that he always will be.

51:35.400 --> 51:38.802
But I hope you understand that I can't
spend the nation's intelligence budget

51:38.880 --> 51:43.329
on an operation whose current status
appears to be somewhat catatonic.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.610
I would need a little more.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.482
Right, that's uh... That's disappointing.

51:49.680 --> 51:53.127
Life's disappointing, Joel. just ask Angela.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.046
Please, come back when you have something.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.009
Our door is always open.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.084
- Was that dull enough for you?
- Are you kidding me?

52:11.160 --> 52:14.164
I never knew an American could sound
so much like a total bloody loser.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.962
How do you stand it, Angela?
"Modest enforcement agency."

52:20.040 --> 52:21.883
- God!
- Well, he's not wrong, is he?

52:21.960 --> 52:24.327
But they must never know
about our boy, Joel.

52:24.440 --> 52:27.046
No mention of him in comms,
nothing written down, nothing at all, yeah?

52:28.200 --> 52:31.124
We keep River House on the outside.
It's too dangerous.

53:13.640 --> 53:14.687
- Daddy!
- Oh, my goodness.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.125
I got a lobster!

53:16.200 --> 53:18.965
- You caught that?
- Javier helped me.

53:19.040 --> 53:20.371
- Did he? Good for him.
- Yeah.

53:20.440 --> 53:21.566
Good for you.

53:21.640 --> 53:24.564
Hello, darling. How are you?
Well done, Danny. Well done.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.729
How is the patient?

54:00.080 --> 54:01.889
You sleep now.

54:01.960 --> 54:04.691
Tomorrow we'll find out who you really are.

54:07.500 --> 54:15.500
