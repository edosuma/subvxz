16:47.232 --> 16:48.172
<i> [Dispatch] Truck 8.</i>

16:48.508 --> 16:50.008
<i> Report of the bear's return</i>
<i> to the hot tub.</i>

16:50.010 --> 16:52.493
<i> Repeat, the bear</i>
<i> is in the bubbles.</i>

16:52.570 --> 16:53.919
Truck 8 responding.

16:54.663 --> 16:57.098
[Patel] This bear is living
a better life than us?

16:58.926 --> 17:00.226
[knocking on door]

17:01.504 --> 17:02.928
Emily. Hey.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.505
I came here to apologize
in person

17:04.582 --> 17:06.415
but now I realize
I'm just cornering you.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.268
You don't have to apologize.
My ear fell off my head.

17:09.345 --> 17:10.770
You probably had the
appropriate reaction.

17:10.772 --> 17:11.771
[laughs]

17:12.090 --> 17:13.865
Well, thank you for being
so cool about it.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.425
I... I really am sorry.

17:16.427 --> 17:17.243
Accepted.

17:19.188 --> 17:21.355
I sense there's something else
on your mind?

17:21.432 --> 17:24.691
The budget report format.
I just... I can't even...

17:24.769 --> 17:27.879
City paperwork's a beast.
Let's get you harmonious.

17:27.955 --> 17:28.621
Oh...

17:28.623 --> 17:29.438
Huh?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.123
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.216
[pans clattering]

17:32.293 --> 17:34.469
-Humans are coming!
-Humans!

17:35.613 --> 17:36.962
[sighs]

17:36.964 --> 17:38.631
He must've hightailed it.

17:38.707 --> 17:39.557
Oh yeah.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.542
You can see his tracks
going down to the woods.

17:41.619 --> 17:42.209
Huh.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.880
Look at that steam.
A perfect 98 degrees I bet.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.025
[water bubbling]

17:57.744 --> 18:00.319
[sighs]
I have to say...

18:00.396 --> 18:02.080
it's everything I thought
it would be.

18:02.156 --> 18:04.248
Yeah. This is nice
and we deserve it.

18:04.325 --> 18:06.233
Especially after
the day we've had.

18:06.311 --> 18:07.126
Yeah.

18:07.662 --> 18:08.494
Hey, listen.

18:09.163 --> 18:11.589
I'm sorry that I was that
annoying person without kids

18:11.666 --> 18:14.317
who thinks they know anything
about parenting.

18:14.319 --> 18:15.167
I don't.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.761
You actually did okay
with Addy.

18:16.912 --> 18:19.155
You rode the bull
for almost 10 minutes.

18:19.157 --> 18:20.489
But then I locked her
in a kennel.

18:20.491 --> 18:22.266
Well, she bucked you
at the end.

18:22.343 --> 18:23.659
She bucked you real hard.

18:23.661 --> 18:24.660
She's a demon.

18:24.662 --> 18:26.062
Mmhmm.

18:27.014 --> 18:29.423
[sighs] Let me
ask you something.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.349
Do you have any interest

18:30.668 --> 18:33.319
in a mixed use warehouse
on Kirkland Avenue?

18:34.948 --> 18:37.340
What was that?
Did you say something?

18:37.342 --> 18:40.025
I'm just... I'm struggling
to hear you over the bubbles.

18:40.027 --> 18:42.036
I'll just chill over here.

18:45.941 --> 18:46.582
Hey.

18:47.201 --> 18:47.700
Hey.

18:48.202 --> 18:50.944
So, um... we cool?

18:51.022 --> 18:51.778
Yeah.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.373
'Cause you know
last night was...

18:54.450 --> 18:56.375
Oh. Yeah, no.
We're cool.

18:56.452 --> 18:58.094
It was pretty fun,
wasn't it?

18:59.030 --> 18:59.953
It was.

19:00.456 --> 19:03.290
Yeah. Okay well,
I'm gonna, uh...

19:03.292 --> 19:05.384
I'm gonna let you bask
in the afterglow.

19:05.461 --> 19:06.627
[laughs]

19:06.629 --> 19:07.395
Okay.

19:07.963 --> 19:08.554
Okay.

19:08.631 --> 19:09.372
See you.

19:09.374 --> 19:10.148
Yeah.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.061
You are in an afterglow, right?

19:16.138 --> 19:17.155
Frank, are you trying
to find out

19:17.306 --> 19:18.990
if I enjoyed
our night together?

19:18.992 --> 19:20.232
[laughs]

19:20.309 --> 19:22.218
Do you want the truth?

19:22.220 --> 19:24.720
Oh. I don't know if
it sounds like I do.

19:24.722 --> 19:28.391
Sometimes people just aren't
a good fit, you know, sexually.

19:28.393 --> 19:34.897
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Okay. Um...

19:34.916 --> 19:36.174
Well, if you,
if you had to, uh...

19:36.176 --> 19:37.175
B-minus.

19:37.568 --> 19:39.159
Why did you think I would want
a letter grade?

19:39.237 --> 19:40.344
It's not a big deal.

19:40.421 --> 19:43.163
No. No, it's not.
It's not.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.590
I assume it was just average
for you too?

19:44.667 --> 19:48.502
Mmhmm. Yeah. A-minus.

19:48.504 --> 19:49.912
Hmm.

19:49.914 --> 19:53.065
Okay. Well, um, I'm gonna...

19:53.676 --> 19:54.417
Yeah.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.252
See what's over here.

19:56.254 --> 19:57.361
Okay, bye Frank.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.107
Hey. So did you talk it out?
You all good?

20:02.184 --> 20:03.350
Good? No.

20:03.686 --> 20:06.287
And, apparently, my penis
needs to go to summer school.

20:07.598 --> 20:09.165
[laughing]

20:11.193 --> 20:13.527
You know, I was intimidated
to meet you

20:13.604 --> 20:15.621
'cause everyone speaks
about you as this great boss

20:15.773 --> 20:18.107
and I'm, like, at best,
a work in progress.

20:18.109 --> 20:20.200
Oh, I bet you're doing better
than you think.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.962
I don't know, uh... maybe.

20:23.038 --> 20:25.556
Come on.
Actualization is afoot.

20:25.633 --> 20:26.891
Seize the day.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.118
That momentum,
keep it rolling. Okay?

20:29.120 --> 20:30.043
[laughs]
Okay, alright.

20:30.045 --> 20:31.103
You're gonna be good.

20:31.639 --> 20:33.189
Thank you, Rick.

20:35.293 --> 20:36.025
Bye.
