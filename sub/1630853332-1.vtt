WEBVTT

01:57.655 --> 01:59.919
Verifying behavioral
functionality.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.146
<i>Alpha testing complete.</i>

05:47.181 --> 05:48.380
<i>The total immersion VR game,</i>

05:48.416 --> 05:50.985
<i>"Dinosaur World,"</i>
<i>is almost ready for release.</i>

05:51.559 --> 05:53.625
<i>Five million will be awarded</i>
<i>to the participants</i>

05:53.660 --> 05:55.627
<i>of the upcoming closed beta,</i>

05:55.662 --> 05:58.531
<i>the ultimate test of</i>
<i>program effectiveness.</i>

05:58.566 --> 06:00.467
<i>20 players will be</i>
<i>selected at random</i>

06:00.502 --> 06:02.799
<i>to compete in our pioneering</i>
<i>gaming experience.</i>

06:03.131 --> 06:06.132
<i>Survive the game and</i>
<i>share in the grand prize.</i>

06:06.167 --> 06:09.476
<i>Everyone is welcome to enter</i>
<i>"Dinosaur World."</i>

06:22.020 --> 06:23.952
Have you figured out how to pay
your tuition next semester?

06:26.055 --> 06:28.561
We've tried about everything,
but it's hopeless.

06:28.761 --> 06:30.024
Just can't afford it.

06:30.257 --> 06:33.467
So that's that. Game over.
See you around.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.097
Go ahead.

06:40.003 --> 06:40.969
No way.

07:05.930 --> 07:07.600
Down. Go down.

07:10.737 --> 07:11.901
Right. Move right.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.179
- Yes!
- Let's get a drink.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.755
- Can I get water?
- Water.

07:30.790 --> 07:31.921
- Soda.
- Soda.

07:34.563 --> 07:35.562
It's Peter.

07:36.631 --> 07:37.630
See what he says.

07:39.129 --> 07:41.898
Peter! What do I owe
the pleasure of your call?

07:42.571 --> 07:45.935
I hear you and Lily are
going to be beta testing
Russell's new game.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.575
You have your own gaming
company to worry about.

07:48.610 --> 07:49.939
<i>- What's it to you?</i>

07:49.974 --> 07:52.645
Let's just say
a little bird told me.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.846
<i> It was easy.</i>

07:53.881 --> 07:56.275
I hacked into their system and
left a little subroutine.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.684
It's a recursive operation
that submits our names

07:58.719 --> 08:01.016
with a callback frequency of
every five seconds.

08:01.656 --> 08:04.624
- Wow, color me impressed.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.318
It was nothing.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.255
Ass kissing aside, Peter,
what do you want?

08:10.027 --> 08:12.126
We never hear from you
unless you want something.

08:12.898 --> 08:15.129
Through my own means,
I'll be in the game with you.

08:16.605 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, good luck with that.

08:19.971 --> 08:22.675
We'll need more than luck.
I want to win.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.611
We can figure this game
out in the process

08:24.646 --> 08:25.975
and produce a copy of it.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.011
How about we partner up?

08:30.685 --> 08:35.182
I have a plan
that will guarantee we win
the five million.

08:35.822 --> 08:38.251
We'll split it
three ways equally.

08:39.694 --> 08:41.826
Think about it. Not bad, right?

08:43.027 --> 08:46.996
Well, five million split
two ways is even better. Hm?

08:49.464 --> 08:53.167
Would you two rather work
with me or against me?

08:53.202 --> 08:55.070
You might end up with
nothing at all.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.611
He's got a point.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.175
Dinosaurs are gonna
be hard enough.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.616
I'd rather not have
to worry about

09:02.651 --> 09:04.343
this sneaky asshole
stabbing us in the back.

09:06.182 --> 09:08.688
<i>So? Can I count on</i>
<i>your cooperation?</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:10.349
Mm. Okay.

09:12.122 --> 09:13.693
We're in.

09:13.728 --> 09:15.156
But we gotta share
the prize equally.

09:15.829 --> 09:17.664
Cool. You're on.

09:56.738 --> 09:57.638
- <i> Hey.</i>
- Hey.

09:58.773 --> 09:59.772
Is he asleep yet?

10:01.303 --> 10:03.776
He just passed out
waiting for your call.

10:04.273 --> 10:05.372
<i>But we should let him</i>
<i>sleep for now.</i>

10:06.781 --> 10:09.947
When you tried calling earlier,
I was working. Sorry.

10:10.884 --> 10:13.214
He's probably upset with me.

10:13.249 --> 10:14.721
<i>Don't let it get to you.</i>

10:14.987 --> 10:16.085
He'll understand.

10:16.857 --> 10:17.658
Mm.

10:18.859 --> 10:20.122
Hey, know what?

10:20.157 --> 10:21.623
<i> Mm-hm?</i>

10:21.659 --> 10:23.290
<i>You know how much he likes</i>
<i>to play the games</i>

10:24.493 --> 10:25.897
made by Mental Abyss? Well,
they're releasing a new one.

10:25.932 --> 10:27.426
I signed up as
a volunteer tester.

10:28.231 --> 10:29.703
And you won't believe
what happened.

10:30.002 --> 10:32.299
Me, they've selected me
to take part.

10:33.368 --> 10:37.238
I really wanted to tell him
today, but I was swamped.

10:37.812 --> 10:39.009
And I just got back.

10:40.278 --> 10:41.880
<i> It's okay.</i>
<i>I'll tell him in the morning.</i>

10:41.915 --> 10:43.475
<i>You know, he's gonna go crazy.</i>

10:43.510 --> 10:46.852
I better get going.
Tomorrow's another long day.

10:47.316 --> 10:48.447
Love you.

10:48.482 --> 10:49.690
Love you too.

11:08.975 --> 11:10.106
- Hi.
- Hm?

11:10.141 --> 11:11.811
You were picked for
the beta too?

11:11.846 --> 11:13.813
- Mm-hm.

11:13.848 --> 11:17.146
Their games are great.
I've played every single one.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.313
Wow, cool.

11:19.348 --> 11:21.249
Oh, what do you think that is?

11:21.284 --> 11:22.855
I'm gonna go check it out.

11:23.352 --> 11:25.891
- Oh, I recognize this.

11:26.388 --> 11:28.421
- It's the--
- Oh!

11:28.456 --> 11:29.796
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

11:29.831 --> 11:30.830
Excuse me.

11:34.198 --> 11:35.461
Um, I'm...

11:36.167 --> 11:37.529
Whoa.

11:41.403 --> 11:43.040
Uh, hi, Peter.

11:44.373 --> 11:46.813
The name's Eric. I know you.

11:47.013 --> 11:48.243
Yeah? Well, I don't know you.

11:50.346 --> 11:51.477
- Sorry.
- Beat it.

11:51.512 --> 11:53.248
My friend must be mixed up.

12:01.225 --> 12:04.457
What do you think? Our AR tech
is pretty realistic, huh?

12:05.966 --> 12:07.559
Hello, players. Welcome.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.935
- You made it.

12:12.907 --> 12:16.876
This game
is like nothing you've
ever experienced before.

12:16.911 --> 12:18.240
There are two things
to remember.

12:18.275 --> 12:19.945
First, when you enter the game,

12:19.980 --> 12:21.276
there will be
backpacks scattered

12:21.311 --> 12:22.882
throughout the starting field.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.951
Each one will carry a variety of
equipment to aid you.

12:25.986 --> 12:28.415
<i>The second is that</i>
<i>there are no rules.</i>

12:28.450 --> 12:30.417
<i>Players still alive</i>
<i>after four hours</i>

12:30.452 --> 12:33.024
<i>share the grand prize</i>
<i>pot of five million.</i>

12:33.059 --> 12:35.829
<i>And if you're the last one</i>
<i>standing, you take it all.</i>

12:35.864 --> 12:38.293
<i>Now get ready. Start-up can be</i>
<i>a bit disorienting.</i>

12:38.933 --> 12:41.560
<i>Welcome to "Dinosaur World."</i>

12:41.595 --> 12:43.870
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

13:00.988 --> 13:02.889
- Run!

13:08.292 --> 13:10.457
Leave the bags. We'll come back.

13:19.369 --> 13:20.973
You won't last long if
you stay here.

13:50.103 --> 13:51.366
They look so real.

13:52.602 --> 13:55.304
- This game is tougher
than I expected.

13:55.339 --> 13:56.739
You could've left me
to die back there.

13:56.774 --> 14:01.013
- Thank me later.
We still got 12 hours in here.

14:15.964 --> 14:16.763
- Stay back.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.033
- Come on! There's a cave here!

14:22.069 --> 14:23.464
- Run!

14:24.973 --> 14:25.906
Yeah, let's go, let's go!

14:25.941 --> 14:28.007
- Get in here!

14:39.053 --> 14:40.052
Shh.

14:51.098 --> 14:51.690
One.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.661
No, no, no, no, no.

14:55.696 --> 14:58.037
- No, no, no.

14:58.765 --> 14:59.631
- Yes.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.635
- No, no. Don't, don't.

15:55.096 --> 15:56.260
I think we're good.

15:57.296 --> 15:58.295
Looks like it.

16:05.436 --> 16:06.501
Thanks.

16:07.504 --> 16:09.339
I know it's not real,
but it sure feels real.

16:11.079 --> 16:13.178
Heart's beating like crazy.

16:14.478 --> 16:16.511
I've never been so scared
before.

16:16.546 --> 16:19.118
We've been hounded nonstop
since we got here.

16:23.553 --> 16:24.618
You smell something?

16:27.128 --> 16:28.358
Did you fart?

16:28.393 --> 16:30.261
Huh? It's you.

16:30.857 --> 16:31.823
Huh?

16:31.858 --> 16:34.067
You're covered in dinosaur spit.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.607
I suppose they meant it when
they said it was real, huh?

16:46.642 --> 16:49.148
- That?

16:52.813 --> 16:54.483
If this part feels real,

16:54.518 --> 16:56.188
then what would being
eaten feel like?

17:55.249 --> 17:56.380
- Whoa.

18:06.227 --> 18:08.194
We should head back now and
see if there are any bags left.

18:17.766 --> 18:18.765
Lily, grab that one.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.446
With a little cover,

18:29.481 --> 18:31.415
this place should be
safe for a while.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.880
If we're lucky, the T-rex scared
away the other players

18:34.915 --> 18:37.190
and, hopefully, the smaller
dinosaurs as well.

18:37.225 --> 18:40.226
If we're lucky?
That's not exactly
a reassuring sentiment.

18:40.558 --> 18:42.195
I can't guarantee anything.

18:42.230 --> 18:43.724
We know next to nothing
about the game.

18:44.727 --> 18:47.332
That said, if it's like
the others I've played,

18:48.830 --> 18:50.236
hiding won't work for long.

18:51.305 --> 18:53.305
Sooner or later,
it's fight or flight.

18:55.474 --> 18:57.276
- What d'you think?
- Huh?

18:57.311 --> 18:58.310
It's good.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.214
- Let's rest.
- Oh, yeah.

19:01.249 --> 19:03.249
- Huh?
- My name is Eason, by the way.

19:03.284 --> 19:05.284
Oh. Eric.

19:05.319 --> 19:06.417
Nice to meet you.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.749
I think we should team up
if we want to win.

19:08.784 --> 19:10.355
I can really use that
prize money.

19:10.390 --> 19:12.786
Yeah, sounds good.
Hope we make it.

19:14.328 --> 19:15.855
Did you have a look
in your bag yet?

19:16.429 --> 19:17.428
Not yet.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.469
Hm.

19:26.505 --> 19:28.802
- I got a rope, looks like.

19:28.837 --> 19:32.212
Rope against dinosaurs?
What good is this?

19:32.808 --> 19:33.607
Whoa!

19:36.977 --> 19:37.976
- Got this knife too.

19:38.484 --> 19:39.483
Mm.

19:40.321 --> 19:42.486
Seriously, talk about
ineffective.

19:42.521 --> 19:44.356
- Not against players.
- Huh?

19:49.858 --> 19:52.232
Hey! Medicine.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.268
I may live through
this after all.

19:56.337 --> 19:58.568
When I fell during the chase,
I got scratched up.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.836
Hey, help me with this?

20:03.674 --> 20:04.805
It'll probably sting a bit.

20:07.781 --> 20:09.975
I'm tough. I survived
a Tyrannosaurus rex.
I can take anything--

20:10.010 --> 20:12.681
- Really, tough guy?

20:15.356 --> 20:17.290
- Don't be so loud, dude.

20:18.326 --> 20:20.392
- Just a bit more.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.394
- All right, calm down, dude.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.561
- Nearly there. Almost done.

20:24.926 --> 20:27.366
The man survived at T-rex,

20:27.929 --> 20:29.335
defeated by salve.

20:33.506 --> 20:34.637
Let's get back inside.

20:37.037 --> 20:39.037
We need to keep
a low profile for now.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.560
Think we're good here.

20:56.958 --> 20:57.757
Yeah.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.895
I hope there's something
awesome in here.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.001
- Hey, how about this?

21:13.975 --> 21:14.974
Hm?

21:15.977 --> 21:18.483
- What do you think this is?

21:23.424 --> 21:24.621
Whoa. Cool, man.

21:24.656 --> 21:26.392
It's a smaller version
of the game map.

21:26.955 --> 21:28.086
Hey, what are the dots for?

21:29.189 --> 21:31.562
I think the green dots show
our current position.

21:32.466 --> 21:34.092
Red dots are likely
the dinosaurs.

21:35.931 --> 21:38.437
There's no way we can
lose with this.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.935
Not really. It doesn't display
the other players.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.513
Antivenom?

21:48.944 --> 21:50.647
What's this for?

21:52.453 --> 21:53.419
Toxic dinosaur?

21:57.986 --> 21:59.117
Ha!

21:59.823 --> 22:01.086
- This.

22:01.121 --> 22:02.461
This is what I'm talking about.

22:03.497 --> 22:06.465
- Nice. That could be fun.

22:06.764 --> 22:08.159
We've got to go, quick.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.534
- Okay.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.477
So here's my plan.
We just stay here hidden.

22:18.512 --> 22:20.677
Yeah, sure beats
running for our lives.

22:20.712 --> 22:23.042
- We'll win this for sure.
- Shh. Someone's here.

22:25.717 --> 22:27.387
Amateurs.

22:28.621 --> 22:30.148
- Hey!

22:30.656 --> 22:31.886
The hell?!

22:31.921 --> 22:33.558
Why'd she do that?

22:33.593 --> 22:35.824
- 'Cause she's mean.
- What you did...

22:38.532 --> 22:39.531
It's a mess.

22:40.127 --> 22:41.126
Hey!

22:41.535 --> 22:42.864
Was this your master plan,

22:42.899 --> 22:43.998
to hide behind some sticks?

22:44.034 --> 22:46.769
Yeah, he was almost eaten
in the first few minutes.

22:46.969 --> 22:49.442
What? Wasn't only me.

22:51.479 --> 22:54.480
Look, she's hurt,
and no use to us.

22:54.515 --> 22:55.646
We should take her out.

22:56.715 --> 22:59.111
She hasn't done anything to us.
She needs help.

22:59.146 --> 23:01.520
I get that, but it'd be
one less person

23:01.555 --> 23:02.521
we need to worry about.

23:03.183 --> 23:04.556
If we don't work together,

23:05.086 --> 23:06.921
I don't think anybody's
gonna win this game.

23:07.891 --> 23:08.890
I won't do it.

23:10.026 --> 23:11.497
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna help you.

23:11.532 --> 23:13.664
Hold on. She might just
be faking it.

23:15.932 --> 23:17.569
No, I don't think so.

23:19.639 --> 23:21.474
- Don't you dare.

23:22.103 --> 23:23.102
It's okay.

23:24.644 --> 23:25.445
Trust me.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.525
I'm going to need your medicine.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.956
- But we might need it.
- Hurry.

23:52.232 --> 23:55.739
Okay. Before I begin,
could you pull your shirt down?

23:56.170 --> 23:59.006
Ju--ju--just a little so I can
see the wound.

24:00.548 --> 24:02.911
If you try to take advantage
of me, you're dead.

24:02.946 --> 24:04.517
I won't, I promise.

24:15.596 --> 24:16.595
It feels so real.

24:18.126 --> 24:19.565
Trust me, I know.

24:26.640 --> 24:31.005
So how did someone so tough
get hurt so bad?

24:32.877 --> 24:33.943
I was careless.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.945
It didn't take long for people
to turn on each other.

24:41.655 --> 24:42.753
I'm Vivian.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.921
I'm Eric.

24:45.956 --> 24:46.955
His name's Eason.

24:53.964 --> 24:55.095
Okay.

24:57.737 --> 24:58.538
All done.

25:01.037 --> 25:02.036
Thank you.

25:02.907 --> 25:03.706
No problem.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.010
Hey, is this a dating app
or a game?

25:11.377 --> 25:12.816
Whatever, dude.

25:51.791 --> 25:52.592
Hey!

26:12.207 --> 26:13.206
Better give that back.

26:13.747 --> 26:15.615
I'm sorry! Sorry.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.884
Okay.

26:36.770 --> 26:37.967
- Watch out!

27:26.820 --> 27:28.149
Looks like a raptor.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.931
Where's she going?

27:40.966 --> 27:42.735
I knew it was a mistake
to trust her.

27:42.770 --> 27:44.099
She just left us here.

27:47.808 --> 27:48.807
Oh. Oh, oh.

28:01.118 --> 28:02.117
- Whoa!

28:03.384 --> 28:04.856
What are you guys doing?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.352
Don't just sit there! Run!

28:07.861 --> 28:09.025
I knew we could trust her.

28:14.035 --> 28:15.735
- Wait, hold on a sec.
- What are you doing?

28:36.582 --> 28:37.790
Help!

28:39.288 --> 28:40.287
Help.

28:42.489 --> 28:43.455
Help me.

28:45.030 --> 28:46.029
Help!

28:51.234 --> 28:52.497
Over there. He needs help.

28:53.203 --> 28:54.202
Grab on!

29:04.585 --> 29:05.378
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm sorry, man.

29:13.223 --> 29:14.827
What's happening?

29:15.621 --> 29:17.830
Wait, wait. We're friendly.

29:17.865 --> 29:19.095
- Don't worry, fellas.
- We're friendly.

29:19.130 --> 29:20.195
This will be quick.

29:30.537 --> 29:31.569
- Sorry.

29:32.077 --> 29:34.176
You guys are so dead.

29:39.887 --> 29:41.282
- Whoa!

29:54.594 --> 29:58.134
Oh, yeah.
Another player is dead.

29:58.169 --> 29:59.564
- Let me see.

30:00.303 --> 30:01.434
Pterodactyl got him.

30:07.244 --> 30:09.948
That building is too big
for there not to be
something useful in it.

30:10.445 --> 30:11.444
Let's go.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.431
- Hey, hey!

30:31.466 --> 30:32.971
- Open the door!
- Open up!

30:33.006 --> 30:35.600
I open this door for you,
and we all die!

30:35.635 --> 30:37.536
- Asshole.
- Come on.

30:54.324 --> 30:55.653
Hey! Hey!

30:56.227 --> 30:58.062
Why didn't you let us in?!

30:58.097 --> 30:59.899
It's everyone for themselves,
you know that!

31:38.137 --> 31:41.039
- All right, let's go!

31:52.151 --> 31:54.118
This is way more stressful
than I expected.

31:54.153 --> 31:55.614
- We're trapped.

31:56.452 --> 31:58.254
Any idea how to get
out of this one?

32:03.228 --> 32:04.425
- Hey.
- Huh?

32:05.296 --> 32:06.460
What are you here for?

32:07.562 --> 32:09.661
I attend a local university.

32:10.070 --> 32:12.103
- Uh-huh.
- Masters in paleontology.

32:12.633 --> 32:14.974
It was going pretty well,

32:16.142 --> 32:18.274
but a year ago,
my mother became very ill.

32:19.178 --> 32:20.474
The medical bills
are adding up.

32:21.114 --> 32:25.083
On top of the tuition,
we just can't afford it.

32:25.745 --> 32:28.152
Might have to drop out
and take care of her.

32:28.187 --> 32:32.090
I see. So this
competition is your best shot.

32:32.125 --> 32:33.289
It is.

32:33.324 --> 32:35.093
The prize money could
go a long way

32:35.755 --> 32:37.557
in paying for her procedures

32:38.098 --> 32:39.658
and giving me a chance
to stay here.

32:42.201 --> 32:44.003
- And you?
- Me?

32:45.567 --> 32:49.173
My life isn't
what you'd call fulfilling.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.405
Wanted some fun.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.144
I'm a math teacher,
and I hate math.

32:53.542 --> 32:55.608
- Math?
- Yeah.

32:55.643 --> 32:57.148
That sounds awful.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.117
- Right?

33:01.121 --> 33:03.517
I tried my best for my students,

33:05.125 --> 33:07.488
but it just wasn't enough.

33:08.359 --> 33:09.754
They still don't like me.

33:11.329 --> 33:13.164
This test is being
streamed online,

33:14.167 --> 33:16.068
so let's win the prize
to show them...

33:18.369 --> 33:20.204
that they have a cool teacher.

33:21.537 --> 33:22.536
Deal.

33:36.618 --> 33:38.057
Eason!

33:57.243 --> 33:57.835
No key.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.673
- What about the machine gun?
- Help me out.

34:01.148 --> 34:03.082
- Uh-huh.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.744
It's not moving.

34:08.221 --> 34:09.418
You guys know how to
hot wire a car?

34:10.521 --> 34:12.322
Do I look like I know how to?
This isn't a movie.

34:25.304 --> 34:26.534
Oh, yeah. That's right.

34:27.834 --> 34:29.141
The knife.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.798
I think that was a gunshot.

36:05.833 --> 36:06.832
Let's go.

36:13.346 --> 36:14.774
Come on, you son of a bitch!

36:21.519 --> 36:23.387
Someone has a gun,
and I want it.

36:23.422 --> 36:24.553
They're not just gonna
give it to you.

36:25.886 --> 36:30.328
I know that, idiot.
Unlike you two, I have a plan.

36:30.363 --> 36:32.561
I asked you to join me
because you're supposed
to be the best,

36:32.596 --> 36:34.464
so less talk, more show.

36:51.450 --> 36:52.482
I think he's alone.

36:53.518 --> 36:55.254
- Wait, he's still armed.

36:55.553 --> 36:57.322
Hey, I got this.

37:02.087 --> 37:03.361
Don't shoot!

37:03.990 --> 37:05.396
I'm unarmed.

37:10.733 --> 37:11.732
Slowly.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.675
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

37:20.710 --> 37:23.447
I was with another player,
but a raptor killed him,

37:23.482 --> 37:25.416
and I ran this way as
fast as I could.

37:28.487 --> 37:31.587
Have you killed anything
with that big gun?

37:34.757 --> 37:36.856
Yeah, I just got three raptors.

37:40.059 --> 37:41.960
It's so big.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.403
- You're so strong.

37:45.438 --> 37:47.031
It's nothing.

37:52.676 --> 37:54.445
Woopsie!

37:55.976 --> 37:58.944
Hey, I think he was
shocked to see me.

37:58.979 --> 38:00.385
- Yeah.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.551
Tie him up.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.686
Let's go, big boy.

38:09.121 --> 38:10.593
- Help!

38:23.476 --> 38:24.673
Help me!

38:25.808 --> 38:26.807
Hey!

38:50.866 --> 38:51.865
Come on.

38:52.571 --> 38:53.372
I can't trust you.

38:56.707 --> 39:02.139
Why? I could've walked away
and let that raptor eat you.

39:06.486 --> 39:07.485
Hm?

39:08.950 --> 39:11.819
Okay, fine.

39:13.658 --> 39:14.657
Bye.

39:41.521 --> 39:42.487
Seriously?

39:45.019 --> 39:46.788
- Come on, guys!
- Bye.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.461
You can't leave me
here like this.

39:50.563 --> 39:51.562
- Hey!
- Hm?

39:52.565 --> 39:55.566
Look, I don't even want the gun.
You can have it.

39:56.195 --> 39:57.700
Just please let me go!

39:58.538 --> 40:01.440
Sorry, can't do that.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.442
Oh, by the way,

40:04.709 --> 40:06.709
I've seen bigger. Hm.

40:11.518 --> 40:12.517
Help!

40:14.950 --> 40:17.522
Somebody help!
- Wait. Did you hear something?

40:18.250 --> 40:20.085
- No.
- Help!

40:20.120 --> 40:21.658
You heard it that time.

40:21.858 --> 40:23.055
Yeah, I did.

40:23.563 --> 40:25.057
- Hey, help me!
- That way!

40:25.092 --> 40:26.223
Anyone!

40:32.539 --> 40:34.231
Hey, someone's coming.

40:43.011 --> 40:45.110
Hey. Hey, over here.

40:45.145 --> 40:47.519
Could you guys help me? Please.

40:47.917 --> 40:50.016
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

40:50.623 --> 40:52.656
How did you manage to
get yourself in this position?

40:52.691 --> 40:54.757
I was tricked by three assholes.

40:55.694 --> 40:57.892
They took my rifle.
Would you guys just get
me outta here

40:57.927 --> 40:59.597
so I can go kill them?

40:59.632 --> 41:00.895
- He's pissed.

41:01.227 --> 41:02.633
Might come in useful.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.096
Yeah. All right.

41:04.736 --> 41:05.735
Just hold on.

41:15.307 --> 41:16.878
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

41:16.913 --> 41:18.649
- Now we're playing.

41:18.684 --> 41:19.683
I like it.

41:21.049 --> 41:22.549
<i>10 players remaining.</i>

41:22.584 --> 41:25.590
<i>New equipment</i>
<i>has been delivered</i>
<i>to the starting area.</i>

41:25.625 --> 41:26.888
Everyone will be
headed that way.

41:27.088 --> 41:29.253
Well, then, let's go back.

41:33.292 --> 41:34.995
- What the hell?

41:46.206 --> 41:47.337
- Poison.

41:47.372 --> 41:49.944
Come on, that was so close.

41:49.979 --> 41:51.781
Wait, did you seriously
catch that dart?

41:53.048 --> 41:54.883
- Wait right here.
- Hm.

42:00.660 --> 42:02.726
Hey, hey, man, I'm sorry!

42:02.761 --> 42:05.124
Hold on!
It's just a game, dude!

42:07.293 --> 42:08.567
Hey! Stop!

42:09.328 --> 42:10.327
Keep away.

42:10.967 --> 42:11.933
You crazy?!

42:12.870 --> 42:14.705
Why'd you shoot it at a kid for?

42:15.642 --> 42:16.608
What's your problem, man?

42:16.808 --> 42:18.302
You are, you spineless coward.

42:19.074 --> 42:21.305
Picking on those who are
too weak to fight back.

42:27.379 --> 42:28.587
Seriously?

42:31.757 --> 42:33.955
How about a taste of
your own medicine?

42:37.697 --> 42:38.696
Whoa.

42:41.734 --> 42:42.898
- All right.

42:43.901 --> 42:45.032
Come on, man.

43:01.116 --> 43:02.918
You take away consequences,

43:03.921 --> 43:05.756
and people show their
true colors.

43:18.870 --> 43:20.100
- Where is he?

43:21.774 --> 43:22.773
I killed him.

43:25.943 --> 43:26.942
I had no choice.

43:28.814 --> 43:29.912
You saved my life.

43:30.244 --> 43:32.079
Yeah, of course.

43:32.477 --> 43:34.686
That's the second time
I saved you.

43:34.721 --> 43:36.413
Let's not make it a habit, okay?

43:37.284 --> 43:39.691
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

43:40.925 --> 43:41.957
Now do you trust me?

43:44.126 --> 43:45.125
Okay.

43:45.864 --> 43:46.764
Okay.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.096
Let's get the new supplies.
Come on.

43:50.836 --> 43:52.066
Don't fall behind.

44:00.945 --> 44:01.944
That way.

44:15.861 --> 44:16.453
Give me it.

44:19.524 --> 44:21.161
How come no one has
shown up yet?

44:22.494 --> 44:23.768
I don't like waiting.

44:24.331 --> 44:26.001
We don't know how many
players are left.

44:27.367 --> 44:30.368
Don't worry, whoever's
still alive will show up.

44:43.284 --> 44:46.087
Hey, why did you sign up
for this anyway?

44:47.321 --> 44:50.025
Hm? Russell's a talented
game designer.

44:52.062 --> 44:54.733
Most of my classmates
love his games.

44:54.999 --> 44:57.868
We all wanted to be chosen
to test "Dinosaur World."

44:57.903 --> 44:59.496
You don't know how envious
my classmates are

44:59.531 --> 45:00.772
that I got picked.

45:01.808 --> 45:03.808
So I tried to stay hidden.

45:04.910 --> 45:07.009
I know I probably
won't win the prize,

45:07.044 --> 45:10.078
but I didn't want to get
killed too soon.

45:10.113 --> 45:12.377
I have a son about
the same age as you.

45:12.412 --> 45:14.885
He really loves the games
Russell makes too.

45:15.481 --> 45:17.184
What do you do in
the real world?

45:17.219 --> 45:18.790
You don't look like a gamer.

45:19.221 --> 45:21.023
I'm a bodyguard for
the rich and powerful.

45:21.828 --> 45:23.795
My job usually keeps me
away from home.

45:24.523 --> 45:26.325
I don't get to see
my son very much.

45:27.834 --> 45:29.867
My son was looking
forward to this game,

45:29.902 --> 45:31.528
so I signed up to surprise him.

45:31.563 --> 45:33.398
I thought that if I won
the competition,

45:33.433 --> 45:35.532
maybe I'd be a little bit
closer to him.

45:36.469 --> 45:37.809
I didn't expect to be chosen.

45:38.978 --> 45:40.042
When the game is over,
we'll have a lot to talk about.

45:40.944 --> 45:43.540
Hopefully, he'll be proud of me,
you know?

45:43.575 --> 45:45.443
I would be proud if
you were my dad.

45:47.447 --> 45:49.447
Let's team up. Come on.

46:01.461 --> 46:03.560
Where were you?

46:04.431 --> 46:05.804
I got lost.

46:06.433 --> 46:07.432
Huh.

46:09.975 --> 46:11.568
- Huh?

46:13.473 --> 46:14.439
What's going on?

46:15.574 --> 46:17.145
- Feels like an earthquake.

46:17.180 --> 46:18.311
Let's go.

46:45.307 --> 46:46.911
Whoa. See that?

46:47.980 --> 46:49.881
Man, they thought of everything.

47:07.131 --> 47:08.130
Quick. Shoot him.

47:09.067 --> 47:10.528
Wait. Something's chasing him.

47:32.959 --> 47:34.222
Oh, damn!

47:34.686 --> 47:35.894
Shh.

47:39.031 --> 47:41.999
One less to worry about.
Can't be many more.

48:00.217 --> 48:01.216
We're not the only ones here.

48:03.055 --> 48:04.120
This doesn't feel right.

48:20.666 --> 48:21.632
There.

48:22.602 --> 48:24.074
They're camping the supplies,

48:24.439 --> 48:26.076
picking off those
who come along.

48:36.715 --> 48:38.253
- Hey, over there.

48:47.561 --> 48:49.264
- This is too easy.

49:12.652 --> 49:14.025
- Wow!

49:21.100 --> 49:21.832
- Watch out!

49:25.170 --> 49:26.169
Eddie!

49:27.139 --> 49:29.436
Hang on.

49:40.515 --> 49:43.516
Still too dangerous.
Just a bit longer.

49:44.420 --> 49:46.684
They ran after them.
Now's a good time to get a bag.

49:46.719 --> 49:48.125
- Wait.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.258
Okay, but let's be quick.

49:49.293 --> 49:50.292
Hurry!

50:01.503 --> 50:03.140
Eddie, hold on.

50:04.176 --> 50:05.406
We have to win, remember?

50:06.607 --> 50:07.639
Just leave me.

50:09.247 --> 50:11.379
Why did you do that?
You could've got away.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.777
You saved my life twice.

50:14.483 --> 50:15.482
I still owe you one.

50:16.881 --> 50:18.353
You're a good kid.

50:18.850 --> 50:20.124
You're gonna be all right.

50:20.786 --> 50:23.391
Besides, if you
still owe me one,

50:24.394 --> 50:26.691
you have to hang on for me,
okay?

50:27.298 --> 50:29.397
Go. They'll be here any moment.

50:33.370 --> 50:35.172
This is painful.

50:46.845 --> 50:49.087
Hey. Hey!

50:50.288 --> 50:52.618
You're gonna wake up
safe and sound.

50:55.524 --> 50:59.427
Kid, I'll make them pay for
what they did to you.

51:24.916 --> 51:26.256
Weird.

51:26.555 --> 51:27.884
I think he was over here.

51:36.895 --> 51:37.894
Where's the other one?

51:40.470 --> 51:41.469
Poor kid.

51:42.406 --> 51:43.801
Better luck next time.

51:50.249 --> 51:51.446
It's our lucky day.

51:52.317 --> 51:53.646
- Look at this.
- You found the key.

51:54.418 --> 51:56.451
Now the jeep is ours. Let's go.

52:03.790 --> 52:04.789
Someone's over there.

52:12.898 --> 52:14.370
They're here! Run!

52:18.904 --> 52:20.310
I don't think they're armed.

52:21.280 --> 52:23.280
It'll be hard to track down
where they went,

52:23.480 --> 52:24.809
but they need to die.

52:25.482 --> 52:27.185
Lily and I will go after them.

52:27.517 --> 52:28.516
You check the supplies.

52:29.013 --> 52:30.485
Okay. I'll check the bags.

52:30.520 --> 52:31.651
Go.

52:53.444 --> 52:54.641
Huh?

53:02.046 --> 53:03.815
Time to pay for what you did.

53:13.695 --> 53:14.727
Help.

53:17.831 --> 53:19.270
Help!

53:19.305 --> 53:20.436
Jeremy.

53:27.874 --> 53:29.775
That guy with the kid we shot.

53:29.810 --> 53:30.809
What happened?

53:32.879 --> 53:34.384
Poison dart.

53:38.555 --> 53:39.488
Did you get him?

53:39.523 --> 53:42.854
- He got away. How's Jeremy?
- It's poison.

53:48.433 --> 53:50.334
I threw away the antivenom.

54:00.104 --> 54:01.477
He also took the scope.

54:02.007 --> 54:02.873
Damn it!

54:03.712 --> 54:05.877
This guy's tough.
We need to be cautious.

54:05.912 --> 54:07.318
What about the other two?!

54:08.387 --> 54:09.815
Gone.

54:09.850 --> 54:12.048
Great.

54:16.758 --> 54:18.560
- Damn it!

54:51.122 --> 54:52.363
- Hey.

54:53.091 --> 54:54.094
Shh.

54:57.964 --> 54:58.963
I'm not a threat.

55:00.266 --> 55:02.868
I know who's chasing you.
They're chasing
after me as well.

55:03.970 --> 55:05.475
We saw them shoot that boy.

55:06.412 --> 55:07.611
- Was he your friend?
- Mm.

55:08.546 --> 55:12.647
So we should team up and kill
those two and be done with it.

55:12.682 --> 55:14.913
Huh? Weren't there three?

55:14.948 --> 55:17.949
Managed to poison one. Got him!

55:17.984 --> 55:19.115
So what should we do now?

55:24.430 --> 55:26.430
It won't be long before
the game's over,

55:26.465 --> 55:28.696
and it doesn't seem like
there are many players left.

55:28.731 --> 55:31.127
Those two pose the only threat.

55:31.162 --> 55:32.799
They're professional gamers.

55:32.834 --> 55:34.438
As if that wasn't bad enough,

55:34.473 --> 55:35.439
they've got a sniper rifle.

55:35.474 --> 55:37.936
As things are,
we can't compete against that.

55:38.609 --> 55:41.511
The grand prize means nothing.
I don't even want it.

55:42.041 --> 55:43.172
But I want to make sure

55:43.207 --> 55:45.416
they don't get
their hands on it either.

55:47.211 --> 55:49.981
I promised Eddie
that I will avenge him.

55:50.654 --> 55:51.653
Mm-hm.

55:52.756 --> 55:55.019
So let's assess our situation,
come up with a plan.

55:55.054 --> 55:57.021
Do you have anything in
your bag we can use?

55:57.529 --> 55:58.528
Oh.

56:00.224 --> 56:02.763
I have two hand grenades.

56:04.536 --> 56:05.799
You should take one.

56:10.542 --> 56:11.541
Mm.

56:13.512 --> 56:15.743
Hey, I got the scope.

56:15.778 --> 56:17.679
I don't need it anymore.
Take it.

56:25.623 --> 56:27.183
- Move! Move!

56:30.188 --> 56:31.693
- Hey. Go!

57:13.737 --> 57:14.736
Take it.

57:19.138 --> 57:19.970
Something found them.

57:21.239 --> 57:23.272
Maybe the dinos will
kill them for us.

57:23.307 --> 57:24.779
We have to make sure.

57:24.814 --> 57:26.616
They didn't last this long
with only luck.

57:26.981 --> 57:29.146
- All right, let's go.

57:29.588 --> 57:30.587
- Mm-hm.
- Clock's ticking.

57:40.929 --> 57:41.994
Not bad, you two.

57:43.261 --> 57:44.667
Alex, there's one
more over there!

58:03.589 --> 58:04.786
Go! This way!

58:55.839 --> 58:58.037
- Grenade!

59:20.094 --> 59:21.896
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

59:23.735 --> 59:24.866
This guy doesn't give up.

59:25.935 --> 59:29.673
Even with a bullet in him,
he nearly took us out.

59:29.708 --> 59:31.070
Are you sure you can kill him?

59:31.105 --> 59:32.269
Yeah.

59:34.680 --> 59:38.275
With those wounds,
he won't be alive much longer.

59:44.250 --> 59:45.315
We made a good team.

59:48.727 --> 59:51.156
You have to go. Just leave me.

59:51.994 --> 59:53.631
But we haven't helped
you avenge Eddie.

59:56.735 --> 1:00:00.165
The longer you stay here,
the more dangerous it becomes.

1:00:01.806 --> 1:00:03.641
Live and fight on.

1:00:07.207 --> 1:00:08.206
Run.

1:00:09.979 --> 1:00:13.079
I swear, we're not gonna
let them win this game.

1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:17.886
Survive till the end,

1:00:17.921 --> 1:00:20.350
and get rid of those
two bastards.

1:00:20.990 --> 1:00:21.989
Now get going.

1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:24.959
Let's go.

1:00:31.737 --> 1:00:32.736
Don't move!

1:00:33.299 --> 1:00:34.804
He's still alive.

1:00:34.839 --> 1:00:35.673
I'm sure I got him.

1:00:36.808 --> 1:00:38.302
You're a lousy shot!

1:00:38.337 --> 1:00:39.809
Your aim was off!

1:00:40.174 --> 1:00:41.173
Then prove it!

1:00:42.109 --> 1:00:44.847
Seriously?!
Didn't you see your friend?!

1:00:44.882 --> 1:00:46.178
You want to end up like him?

1:00:47.786 --> 1:00:50.281
You two won't stand
a chance against me.

1:00:50.316 --> 1:00:53.350
Listen, how about you step out

1:00:54.826 --> 1:00:56.760
and we can talk through
a solution to this?

1:01:28.321 --> 1:01:29.320
Is he dead?

1:01:35.559 --> 1:01:37.229
One of the best players
I've ever seen.

1:01:38.001 --> 1:01:39.099
What about the other two?

1:01:39.904 --> 1:01:41.167
We still need to take them out.

1:02:01.519 --> 1:02:03.090
There's not much time. Let's go.

1:02:04.357 --> 1:02:05.455
- Get the jeep.
- Okay.

1:02:15.236 --> 1:02:16.301
We can't stay here.

1:02:17.404 --> 1:02:18.002
- It's too dangerous.

1:02:33.925 --> 1:02:35.221
- Man the gun.
- Yeah.

1:02:38.897 --> 1:02:40.457
Woo!

1:02:46.366 --> 1:02:47.332
Let's get those two.

1:02:50.469 --> 1:02:52.876
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1:03:19.333 --> 1:03:20.629
- Hey, Eric!

1:03:20.664 --> 1:03:23.137
How's it going down there?

1:03:23.172 --> 1:03:24.468
Are you kidding, dude?

1:03:25.009 --> 1:03:26.470
You're actually still alive?

1:03:26.505 --> 1:03:29.605
Yeah. Pterodactyl dropped me
in her nest and flew away.

1:03:30.278 --> 1:03:32.014
I found some Easter eggs.

1:03:32.049 --> 1:03:33.147
- Easter eggs?
- Yup.

1:03:34.051 --> 1:03:35.149
- Come here.

1:03:38.121 --> 1:03:39.857
Let me show you.
See? There.

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:43.256
<i>I can talk to dinosaurs.</i>

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:44.455
Get outta here.

1:03:47.658 --> 1:03:48.866
Huh?

1:03:50.034 --> 1:03:51.968
- Hey, do you hear that?

1:03:52.003 --> 1:03:53.068
Sounds like an engine.

1:03:54.368 --> 1:03:55.367
Over there.

1:04:04.950 --> 1:04:07.016
It's them. They've got
themselves a jeep.

1:04:08.085 --> 1:04:09.645
Huh. Of course they did.

1:04:11.055 --> 1:04:12.516
And it's got a machine gun.

1:04:13.717 --> 1:04:15.024
Then we're as good as dead.

1:04:16.357 --> 1:04:17.928
What do we do?

1:04:17.963 --> 1:04:19.028
We can't take them on.

1:04:28.105 --> 1:04:29.973
- Triceratopses.
- Huh?

1:04:30.008 --> 1:04:31.007
Where?

1:04:32.406 --> 1:04:34.604
They're like scale-covered
battering rams.

1:04:35.475 --> 1:04:37.112
If only we can use 'em somehow.

1:04:40.216 --> 1:04:41.380
I got this.

1:04:48.554 --> 1:04:50.686
- Where are you going?

1:05:14.679 --> 1:05:15.953
What are you waiting for?!
Shoot!

1:05:21.191 --> 1:05:22.993
- Yeah!

1:05:29.133 --> 1:05:31.595
- Huh?

1:05:49.318 --> 1:05:50.482
Yeah!

1:05:56.061 --> 1:05:57.126
You gotta be kidding me!

1:05:59.229 --> 1:06:00.426
Just keep shooting!

1:06:34.165 --> 1:06:35.164
Huh?

1:06:37.168 --> 1:06:38.035
No more ammo!

1:06:45.176 --> 1:06:47.671
A man and a woman in
a black jeep heading that way.

1:06:48.179 --> 1:06:51.180
All right. Gonna talk to the
pterodactyl and T-rex now.

1:06:51.215 --> 1:06:51.807
Thanks, guys.

1:06:55.450 --> 1:06:57.813
Okay, they're gonna help us out.

1:06:58.486 --> 1:07:01.190
You sure they got the message?

1:07:01.225 --> 1:07:02.455
You doubt me?

1:07:11.730 --> 1:07:13.664
- Come on!

1:07:40.561 --> 1:07:43.463
Why are they chasing us?

1:07:46.897 --> 1:07:49.172
- It's those two.

1:07:49.207 --> 1:07:50.173
I'm sure of it.

1:08:45.263 --> 1:08:46.262
It's the volcano.

1:08:46.990 --> 1:08:48.231
We should get to higher ground.

1:08:48.266 --> 1:08:49.265
Yeah.

1:09:03.314 --> 1:09:05.644
The game's nearly over.
Almost there.

1:09:06.317 --> 1:09:07.316
Yeah.

1:09:25.402 --> 1:09:27.336
- Hey!
- It's over!

1:09:27.371 --> 1:09:30.405
- Wait.
- Come any closer,
and he's dead!

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:32.374
I win!

1:09:32.706 --> 1:09:35.212
- Hey, easy. Easy.

1:09:35.610 --> 1:09:37.478
- It's okay.
- Don't you move!

1:09:37.513 --> 1:09:38.842
It's okay. It's okay.

1:09:39.317 --> 1:09:40.646
- Not a muscle!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:09:40.681 --> 1:09:41.878
- Stay back--
- Forget about me.

1:09:41.913 --> 1:09:43.913
...or I'll kill you too!
I swear it!

1:09:44.322 --> 1:09:46.256
But I know how you can get
what you really want.

1:09:46.291 --> 1:09:48.390
- It's not worth it.
- I know,
it's not about the money.

1:09:48.425 --> 1:09:49.325
You want to copy the code.

1:09:50.161 --> 1:09:51.360
We found an Easter egg.
It's yours.

1:09:51.890 --> 1:09:53.857
- What?
- If you let him go.

1:09:54.464 --> 1:09:55.496
Don't do it.

1:09:56.026 --> 1:09:57.663
Take me. I'll show you.

1:10:06.575 --> 1:10:07.574
Good game.

1:10:08.577 --> 1:10:11.743
- Huh?
- Hey, man,
Easter egg's right here.

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:17.551
It's a gift from Alex.

1:11:07.900 --> 1:11:10.439
Congratulations. You win.

1:11:12.509 --> 1:11:15.411
Eric, thank you.

1:11:15.446 --> 1:11:17.072
<i>Congratulations to Eason</i>

1:11:17.107 --> 1:11:19.041
<i>for being</i>
<i>the last man standing,</i>

1:11:19.076 --> 1:11:20.977
<i>and thanks to all</i>
<i>the chosen volunteers</i>

1:11:21.012 --> 1:11:22.946
<i>for their exemplary</i>
<i>participation.</i>

1:11:29.020 --> 1:11:30.019
Thanks.

1:11:32.496 --> 1:11:35.057
<i> 35 million viewers</i>
<i>watched your performances</i>

1:11:35.092 --> 1:11:36.828
<i>and voted on which</i>
<i>player would receive</i>

1:11:36.863 --> 1:11:38.467
<i>an additional five million.</i>

1:11:38.502 --> 1:11:40.568
<i>They voted for the person</i>
<i>who most embodied</i>

1:11:40.603 --> 1:11:43.505
<i>the virtues of selflessness</i>
<i>and good sportsmanship,</i>

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:45.903
<i>which was the true objective</i>
<i>of this competition.</i>

1:11:45.938 --> 1:11:48.477
<i>And the vote went to Eric!</i>

1:11:51.713 --> 1:11:52.745
Good job.

1:11:54.584 --> 1:11:56.947
Congrats, man.

1:11:56.982 --> 1:11:58.916
<i> We always believed</i>
<i>that games were about</i>

1:11:58.951 --> 1:12:01.149
<i>more than points</i>
<i>and leaderboards.</i>

1:12:01.184 --> 1:12:02.887
<i>You showed that</i>
<i>the determination</i>

1:12:04.323 --> 1:12:07.089
<i>to stick to your principles is</i>
<i>more important than winning.</i>

1:12:57.548 --> 1:12:59.075
Dinner's on me tonight!

1:13:01.651 --> 1:13:04.212
- Hey! Congratulations.
- Good game, dude.

1:13:04.247 --> 1:13:05.422
- Hey.
- Good game.

1:13:07.217 --> 1:13:09.525
<i> Jeremy, Lily,</i>
<i>in response to hacking</i>

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:11.659
<i>our systems to secure entry</i>
<i>into the competition,</i>

1:13:11.694 --> 1:13:14.695
<i>you are hereby banned from</i>
<i>all Mental Abyss games.</i>

1:13:14.730 --> 1:13:16.191
What?!

1:13:17.260 --> 1:13:19.535
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?!

1:13:19.570 --> 1:13:22.472
It was your idea
to hack the system
in the first place!

1:13:23.706 --> 1:13:25.607
<i> Peter is also banned</i>
<i>from our games</i>

1:13:25.642 --> 1:13:26.741
<i>for hacking the system.</i>

1:13:26.777 --> 1:13:28.907
<i>Plus, his in-game</i>
<i>conduct was witnessed</i>

1:13:28.942 --> 1:13:30.843
<i>by all his customers</i>
<i>and clients.</i>

1:13:30.878 --> 1:13:32.240
- Congrats.
- Good game.

1:13:35.113 --> 1:13:36.112
Come on.

1:13:41.790 --> 1:13:43.460
- Mm.
- See you later.

1:13:54.132 --> 1:13:56.671
Hey, I was thinking
we'd share the prize money,

1:13:56.871 --> 1:13:58.200
but I guess there's no need now.

1:13:58.235 --> 1:14:00.235
I mean, I won't say no
to more money.

1:14:00.270 --> 1:14:02.611
- Oh, greedy!

1:14:02.646 --> 1:14:03.238
In your dreams.

1:14:07.211 --> 1:14:08.617
Let's go!
