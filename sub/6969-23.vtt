there as well.

he was somehow inspired to go out

[ Phone Ringing ]

36:08.313 --> 36:10.247
Ward three.

36:10.315 --> 36:12.943
This is Fox Mulder with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

36:13.017 --> 36:15.110
I need to talk
to Dr. Stroman, please.

36:15.186 --> 36:18.781
I'm sorry. Dr. Stroman
is no longer here. I believe
he's returned to Washington.

36:18.857 --> 36:20.950
- Know where I can reach him ?
- I'm not sure.

36:21.025 --> 36:24.426
He left us a local number.
It's around here somewhere.

36:28.299 --> 36:30.893
- Is it 555-01 35 ?
- That's it.

36:31.002 --> 36:32.594
Thank you.

36:35.139 --> 36:37.664
You want me to go first
this time ?

36:37.775 --> 36:39.709
Damn straight.

36:47.452 --> 36:50.853
I haven't had a chance to clean
the room yet. He just checked out.

36:50.922 --> 36:53.891
But with all the excitement,
I don't blame him.

37:01.332 --> 37:03.266
- Do you charge for local calls ?
- Of course.

37:03.334 --> 37:06.098
- Then you'd have a record
of all calls made from here ?
- I'll get it.

37:06.204 --> 37:07.694
Thank you.

37:17.815 --> 37:21.114
Here you go.

37:21.185 --> 37:23.119
Thanks.

37:25.123 --> 37:27.057
Thank you.

37:34.065 --> 37:36.795
Hey, Danny. It's Mulder. I need you
to check a number for me.

39:04.489 --> 39:07.890
- That's what he told me, Stroman.
- Then where is he ?

39:07.959 --> 39:11.861
- He said he'd be here.
- He'll be here.

39:11.929 --> 39:15.126
It’s almost 7:00.
I can’t wait any longer.

39:18.870 --> 39:21.395
There's no sign of him !

39:33.051 --> 39:35.952
[Gunshots]

39:58.543 --> 40:02.502
You're too late, Agent Mulder.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.514
Now that you’ve destroyed
all the evidence.

40:04.582 --> 40:07.642
You were told this would happen.
You made your choice.

40:07.752 --> 40:09.686
I just didn't know
I was working for you.

40:09.754 --> 40:12.723
I had no alternative.
I was being watched too closely.

40:12.790 --> 40:14.917
I couldn't risk
compromising myself.

40:14.992 --> 40:18.951
- Why kill them if you wanted me
to expose them ?
- Those were always my orders.

40:19.030 --> 40:22.431
I was just hoping
you'd get to them first.

40:22.500 --> 40:26.095
And uncover what ? What were they trying
to do ? Manipulate people's behavior ?

40:26.170 --> 40:29.037
Alter their decision-making process ?
What to buy ? Who to vote for ?

40:29.107 --> 40:31.803
You think they'll stop
at commerce and politics ?

40:34.445 --> 40:36.777
Where will they stop ?

40:36.848 --> 40:39.373
That's where you failed,
Agent Mulder.

40:39.484 --> 40:42.112
Don't lay this off on me.
You pulled me into this situation...

40:42.186 --> 40:44.552
because you didn't have the courage
to reveal the truth yourself.

40:45.656 --> 40:47.590
- Feel better now ?
- You're a coward !

40:47.658 --> 40:51.651
You work in the shadows.
You feed me scraps, hoping
that I could piece it together.

40:51.729 --> 40:54.197
You've made me risk my life,
you've risked my partner's life...

40:54.265 --> 40:57.632
and you never risk
your own !

41:03.941 --> 41:06.068
You’re not walking
away from this.

41:09.013 --> 41:11.914
You're risking your life
right now.

41:16.487 --> 41:18.717
You failed.

41:18.790 --> 41:22.055
This is your success ?
Killing me ?

41:23.327 --> 41:27.593
The truth is,
you need me, Agent Mulder.

41:45.550 --> 41:47.984
[Sirens Wailing in Distance]

41:49.687 --> 41:51.951
This is your final report,
Agent Mulder ?

41:52.023 --> 41:55.959
- Yes, sir.
- I see more questions here
than I do answers.

41:56.027 --> 41:59.758
You don't know who manufactured
the device you found or what
its purpose was.

41:59.831 --> 42:02.391
- No, sir.
-[Knock At Door]

42:05.036 --> 42:07.766
- Agent Scully, welcome back.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

42:07.839 --> 42:09.773
I just got back
from the documents section.

42:09.841 --> 42:12.537
What did you find out about the
two men Mulder found executed ?

42:12.610 --> 42:15.602
The cable company employee
had no criminal record.

42:15.713 --> 42:18.841
In fact, there was nothing
remarkable about him whatsoever.

42:18.950 --> 42:22.181
We found a medical license
under the name " Dr. Henry Stroman"...

42:22.253 --> 42:24.187
in Falls Church, Virginia.

42:24.255 --> 42:26.746
He died in 1 978.

42:26.824 --> 42:29.588
What about their killer ?

42:29.660 --> 42:32.322
He remains an unknown subject.

43:03.728 --> 43:05.628
Have you completed
your work ?

43:05.696 --> 43:08.062
All the personnel
and hardware have been removed.

43:08.132 --> 43:10.259
But Mulder still has
one of the devices.

43:10.334 --> 43:12.268
Well, it proves nothing.

43:13.504 --> 43:16.701
What about, uh,
Mulder's source ?

43:16.774 --> 43:19.368
He's been eliminated.

43:19.443 --> 43:21.911
And his source ?

43:23.247 --> 43:25.875
Who's he working with ?

43:25.983 --> 43:28.417
That person remains unknown.
