(GROANS) Oh, I fear
I may not survive this
war reenactment.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.864
I can't believe we're only
12 feet from the parking lot.

00:31.949 --> 00:35.493
(CHUCKLES) This is
every bit as fun
as the real Civil War.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.664
Not the Civil War, Private.
We're reenacting
the Sith-il War.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.749
Sith? What the Hoth?

00:41.834 --> 00:44.585

I am Darth Stroyer.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.230
Darth Stroyer?
That's the stupidest

Let's hear the rest.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.735

Darth Sploder.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.777
It is done.

No, I'm just very old.

Whoa. That's good acting.

02:18.222 --> 02:22.975
Tell my mother to pick me up
outside Quiznos.

That's three dead.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.314
Let's pick up the pace,
people.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.816
At this point in
the actual war,

02:29.900 --> 02:32.276
the death toll
was 98 million.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.905

02:45.123 --> 02:47.083
They're putting me
in my Sunday suit

02:47.209 --> 02:49.126
and shoving me
in a wooden box.

02:50.087 --> 02:54.090

into the cold, cold ground.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.385
Hello,
here come the worms.
(LAUGHING)

02:58.345 --> 03:00.972
If you were really dead,
you wouldn't be
laughing so hard.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.059
Yeah, death's a big deal
to you flesh bags.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.145
But in case you
didn't notice,
I'm a robot.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.232
So? What if something heavy
fell on you, like a church?

03:11.316 --> 03:12.400
You could still die.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.693
Nuh-uh!

03:13.777 --> 03:16.988
My wireless backup unit
saves a copy of me every day.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.574
So, if my body gets killed,
big whoop,

03:19.658 --> 03:21.826
I just download
into another body.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.202
I'm immortal, baby.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.204
What? Then how come
you always scream

03:25.289 --> 03:26.914
so much when
you're in danger?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.667
I never said I wasn't
a drama queen.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.004
And the winner
of the war is...

03:34.006 --> 03:36.007
Let me just cross-check
my tabulation here.

Factor in the corsages

Everybody but me
is dying of old age!

03:43.849 --> 03:45.141
Okay.

I've got pains in joints
I had removed a century ago.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.762
Bender, bring me
my soft chair with
the wheels on it.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.348
Your wheelchair?
I don't need a wheelchair!

04:25.432 --> 04:27.266
The one with the wheels!

04:27.351 --> 04:29.435
Poor flimsy humans.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.021
Don't you wish you were
flawless like me?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.649
A towering inferno of
physical perfection?

04:34.733 --> 04:38.319
I hate to pop
your blimp-like ego,
but you are not perfect.

Are not.

whose opinion I even
remotely respect.

04:48.455 --> 04:52.458
Inspector 5,
the best inspector
a kid could want.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.877
The day I was built,
he looked me over,

04:55.045 --> 04:57.296
probably with tears
of pride in his eyes,

04:57.381 --> 04:59.340
and proclaimed
to all the world,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.467
by means of this
scrap of paper,

05:01.551 --> 05:05.429
that I was perfect and
infallible in every way.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.431
Hey, Mr. Perfect,

05:07.516 --> 05:09.183
you wet the chair.

05:09.267 --> 05:13.896
Huh? It wasn't me.
Must be some of that urine
you're all so proud of.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.358
That's not urine.
It's oil.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.695

caused the leak?

05:33.709 --> 05:35.918

on account of
I'm so hot?

05:36.586 --> 05:37.878
Alas, no.

05:37.963 --> 05:42.341
Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's
a symptom of a fatal defect.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.926
Yeah, fatal, schmatal.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.762
If I die, I can just
download my backup copy

05:46.847 --> 05:49.306
into a new,
equally fabulous body.

05:49.391 --> 05:54.437
That's just it. You can't!
You were built without
a backup unit!

There's no backup
copy of me?

and a billion years.

Well, at least you
can plan accordingly.

How do you living beings
cope with mortality?

to be perfect!

his blessing!

How could he bring me
into this world
knowing I would die?

So you wish you
were never born, maybe?

06:51.286 --> 06:55.414
Yes, anything less
than immortality is
a complete waste of time!

Inspector 5 and beat
an explanation out of him!

I'm all for a good beating,
but you'll never find him.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.720
Product inspectors
are bureaucrats,

who blend into the woodwork.

you might be able
to find Inspector 5

13:01.448 --> 13:05.200
A pile of dead bears can
only mean one thing.
But what?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.539
It's the 7:38!

13:10.957 --> 13:12.082
Jump!

13:15.044 --> 13:17.045
BENDER: Shoot!
Someone said shoot.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.399
Well, we're boned.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.567
No, we're not!

13:38.651 --> 13:39.985
We just got to limbo.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.864
But I'm not
designed to bend that low,
not without limbo music.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.949
(BULLETS STRIKING

13:46.034 --> 13:47.534

Ow! Ow! Ow! (GRUNTS)

13:51.456 --> 13:52.664
We're gonna get fired.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.916
Someone said fire.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.302
(BENDER WHOOPING)

14:05.386 --> 14:06.512
We did it!

14:06.596 --> 14:08.347
Twelve straight hours
of limbo.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.224
I haven't done that
since my honeymoon.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.684
Hermes, Hermes,
remember that
flock of bats?

14:12.769 --> 14:13.852
I sure do.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.103
That was fun.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.314
BENDER: Where are we?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.815
I have no idea.

(BOTH EXCLAIM)

14:27.283 --> 14:30.744
Hey,
we're just a stone's throw
from Tijuana.

14:30.828 --> 14:31.912
See?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.790
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)

14:34.874 --> 14:39.670
A rock has fallen here,
in the outskirts of Tijuana.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.588
Is it within
the city limit?

14:41.673 --> 14:43.257
I think, yes.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.383
Told you.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.343
Hey, you want to
celebrate our escape?

14:46.427 --> 14:49.346
Maybe grab a shot
of tequila and take in
a big-league cockfight?

14:49.430 --> 14:52.224
Sure. No, wait.
I was built in Tijuana.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.893
Maybe Inspector 5
still works there.

14:54.978 --> 14:59.940
He better do some explaining
before I mash up
some face guacamole.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.654
He's Mexican, I'm Mexican.
Let me handle this.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.867
Si!

15:11.369 --> 15:12.578

15:16.666 --> 15:18.375

15:18.459 --> 15:20.210

15:22.171 --> 15:24.965
Okay. I also would
have accepted a bribe.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.260
Nice work, butterball.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.555

I was in Italy last week.

a shrine to me.

selling piñatas of me!

15:42.692 --> 15:44.026
End of the line, man.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.112
Come on, we can still catch
a twi-night double cockfight.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.032
No, wait! What's that
in the Mexican garbage?

15:50.116 --> 15:52.159
Looks like
a half-eaten cheese diaper.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.368
No, next to that.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.873
A half-eaten

16:15.642 --> 16:17.351
Where are you hiding,
you coward?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.603
Get out here and get
murdered like a man!

16:20.480 --> 16:24.566
Bender, I'm afraid
our search is at an end.
He's obviously long gone.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.984
Oh, yeah?

16:26.069 --> 16:28.570
Well, maybe this is
him in a costume!

16:29.238 --> 16:32.491
I'm gonna squeeze you
out of there like
Tijuana toothpaste!

16:38.998 --> 16:41.500
Okay, Bender,
you're mortal.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.127
And, okay,
Inspector 5 screwed up.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.422
But that just makes
the time you have left
all the more precious.

16:47.590 --> 16:51.718
Do you really want to waste
the rest of your life
in a bitter, homicidal rage?

16:51.803 --> 16:54.346
No! Yes!

16:55.306 --> 16:57.432
I don't know!

17:05.066 --> 17:08.109
Why?
Why did he do this to me?

17:08.486 --> 17:11.445
All I wanted was
a little quality control.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.782
But he didn't care enough.
And now I'm gonna die!

17:15.326 --> 17:18.704
I deserve better!
I'm Bender, damn it!

17:23.126 --> 17:26.002
There, there, man.
It's gonna be okay.

17:26.087 --> 17:30.257
You are Bender,
which is something
Inspector 5 will never be.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.010
You know what?
You're right.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.054
He was just
a stupid bureaucrat.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.348
A stupid,
paper-pushing bureaucrat.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.059
A stupid l-dotting,

Oh.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.021
No offense, Hermes.
You're not like that.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.899
I mean,
you're exactly like that,
but you're okay!

In fact, I'm putting you
on the do-not-kill list.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.866
Come on, fellow mortal.
We're in Tijuana.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.492
I want to live a little.

17:58.161 --> 18:01.371
Help! I'm gonna die!
That's the opposite
of what I want!

18:06.878 --> 18:08.378
Quick, run out the back!

18:08.463 --> 18:11.256
I'll hack into
Inspector 5's terminal
and fake your death,

18:11.340 --> 18:12.716
so they'll call
off the kill-bots.

terminal is unhackable!

at that cool explosion.

look so easy.

you were looking for?

19:45.142 --> 19:47.394
Nah, but thanks
to this knucklehead,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.771
I did find a new
outlook on life.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.356
It's precious and sacred.
