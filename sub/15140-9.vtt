00:00.083 --> 00:02.001
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.085 --> 00:05.881
[Kelly] This was footage of Nathan
Templeton at a private fundraiser in 1965.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.966
Segregation is the word of God.

00:08.050 --> 00:11.845
If the Lord Almighty wanted
colored people to mix with whites,

00:11.929 --> 00:14.223
to live with whites, to marry whites,

00:14.306 --> 00:16.934
he wouldn't have placed them
on separate continents.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.895
I don't believe that tape
represents who you are today.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.897
It doesn't represent who I ever was.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.899
- It doesn't have to get out.
- Why?

00:23.982 --> 00:26.860
I think the country
doesn't need another scandal now.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.571
Maybe you want to have something
to hold over my head.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.365
[Nathan] I trusted you, Jayne.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.784
I gave you information
from him whenever I could.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.869
This time you gave
my information to him.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.580
- Mr. Speaker...
- No! Just get out of here.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.040
I don't want to see you again.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.418
- I'm moving Rod into the West Wing.
- Completely your call, ma'am.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.837
I would like to welcome
Rod Calloway to our staff.

00:45.921 --> 00:49.383
I learned a long time ago, never cross
anyone who sleeps with the boss.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.345
I'm focused on her new agenda here.
You have a White House to run. Run it.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.934
We're an independent commission.
The goal is to be above politics.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.936
- Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!
- Yes.

01:01.019 --> 01:04.063
[woman] Was economic impact
a factor in your recommendations?

01:04.147 --> 01:06.775
We considered all factors,
but our mandate is to provide

01:06.858 --> 01:10.279
the best proposals possible
to shape the future of our military.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.115
You're recommending closure
of Essex Base in Connecticut,

01:13.198 --> 01:16.118
which could devastate the economy
in the president's home state.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.246
- Has she been consulted?
- The White House received our report.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.915
And I am sure
that the president and her staff

01:21.999 --> 01:24.334
are currently reviewing
our recommendations.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.794
How did we not know about this?

01:25.877 --> 01:27.921
Essex Naval
wasn't supposed to be on there.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.757
It's always in consideration.
It never makes the list.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.135
It made the top of the list.
They close that base,

01:33.218 --> 01:36.972
they're gonna put over 30,000 people
out of work. People that I grew up with.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.975
Independent commission
means independent of the president.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.645
Look, it's your state. It's your watch.
This is tonight's lead story.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.148
Just what we need.
Three days before Thanksgiving.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.359
It's a tricky dance. You're heartless
to people in your home state

01:49.443 --> 01:51.153
or weak on defense across the board.

01:51.236 --> 01:55.032
Does no one here care that closing the
base might be what's best for the country?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.659
No, you're the only one
that cares about the country.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.995
The rest of us are here
just for the book deals.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.664
OK, OK. Let's focus on options.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.667
The best thing for us is to remain
above the fray. Let it play out.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.502
- Let the base close.
- We stick our nose in, we get bloody.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.382
- Then they'll probably close the base.
- Which will make us seem ineffective.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.178
So it's better to be ineffective than
seem ineffective, right? What a town.

02:16.261 --> 02:20.474
Excuse me, everybody.
I'd like to introduce Richard McDonald.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.351
Dickie, what are you doing here?

02:22.434 --> 02:25.187
Nice to see they're keeping
the chief of staff in the loop.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.357
- Thank you for coming by.
- Honor to meet you, Madam President.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.693
Kelly Ludlow, veep's director of comm
turned White House press sec.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.196
- Meteoric rise.
- Thank you.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.491
- Please.
- We don't want to interrupt.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.202
Yeah. Just observing. Don't mind me.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.871
We're reviewing options
for the Essex Base closure.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.792
And I was saying, as a retired general
who once sat on BRAC,

02:46.875 --> 02:48.377
they know what they're doing.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.880
The closure of a base in the president's
hometown before Thanksgiving.

02:51.963 --> 02:56.551
It's a nonpartisan recommendation of
what they think is best for national defense.

02:56.635 --> 03:00.013
We should cancel this week's
press conference till after the holidays.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.556
Let this blow over.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.393
I can't cancel my second
weekly press conference.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.936
Agreed. Rod?

03:07.813 --> 03:09.606
- Dickie?
- Yes.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.568
Kelly? You have talking options?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.404
We didn't know the base was on the list.

03:15.487 --> 03:18.031
Don't you have talking points
ready on every option?

03:18.115 --> 03:20.158
We're not looking back
at what we didn't do.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.912
Look forward to what we can do.
The press conference isn't till Wednesday.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.915
- No need to make announcements.
- Holiday press, reporters,

03:26.998 --> 03:29.584
- good way to let the story die.
- 8:45, Madam President.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.170
You have a working call
with the EU at 9:00.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.756
OK. We'll get back to this.
We'll pick this up.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.008
Uh, Mac. Dickie's
gonna join us in the Oval

03:37.092 --> 03:39.886
- for a few minutes before your phone call.
- Great.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.560
I'd appreciate you letting me know
when you're bringing someone new in.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.938
It undermines me with the staff
if it seems I'm out of the loop.

03:50.021 --> 03:54.192
You're right. I'm sorry.
I won't let that happen again.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.572
- Thank you, Vince.
- You're welcome.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.617
Vince Taylor, Dickie McDonald. Nice work
going public on your gay/HIV thing.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.454
The president's empathy rating
went up four points.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.705
OK, then, good.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.626
- Sorry the schedule's tight.
- Well, you're the president.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.004
- I'd be worried if it were any other way.
- Please.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.505
Thank you.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.175
Rod thinks we need some help.
They say you're the best.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.470
Your numbers are below where they
should be. You're playing defense.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.930
We know the critique.
We're looking for strategy.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.851
That's what I do. One question first.
Are you going to run for reelection?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.062
I hadn't really thought about it much yet.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.149
- Uh, we came into this kind of fast.
- I realize that,

04:34.232 --> 04:37.694
but unless you're going to run
there's not much point in my being here.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.821
We know that you're mainly
a campaign guy,

04:39.905 --> 04:42.282
but we want to start with image issues...

04:42.365 --> 04:44.785
Whether she's running is the image issue.

04:44.868 --> 04:48.079
Ma'am, with due respect,
you haven't been elected to this position

04:48.163 --> 04:50.499
and made no indication
as to whether you want to be.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.250
If you don't start running today,

04:52.334 --> 04:54.503
you're a lame duck for the next two years.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.130
Ma'am. The EU working group
is on the line.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.299
Thank you. We'll talk further.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.594
To start with, I'd like to know how
you'd frame the base closure issue.

05:02.677 --> 05:06.515
Unless you're running, it's not gonna
matter what position you take on the bases.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.434
It's not gonna matter what
position you take on anything.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.194
Rumor is the president's decided to run.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.655
- That's your "hello"?
- Come on.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.658
- You guys brought in Dickie McDonald.
- Like a half hour ago.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.035
Did somebody send up
a smoke signal from the RNC?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.995
Oh, we use instant messaging now.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.374
- She's definitely running?
- If she is, she hasn't told me.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.668
What about you?
Any progress on the job front?

05:34.751 --> 05:38.004
Actually, I found something.
K Street. Gerken and Leigh.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.215
See? Big time lobbyist. That was fast.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.591
Part-time lobbyist.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.885
They gave me one client,
said they'd see how I do.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.762
- Who's the client?
- B.K. Industries.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.014
They do guidance systems for submarines.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.685
Let me guess. Their biggest contract
is with Essex Naval Base.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.897
It's the president's home state. The nation
can't give up its edge in naval warfare.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.315
What do you need?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.569
I want to talk to the president.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.823
Come on, Jim. I lost my job over you.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.408
You owe me.

06:06.491 --> 06:11.037
Luncheon speech to the AARP,
sec def 2:15, FBI briefing...

06:11.121 --> 06:14.499
See if you can get Templeton in here
for a closed door on Essex Naval.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.584
Yes, ma'am.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.128
You have the AARP speech
to look at on the way?

06:19.170 --> 06:23.258
- You know a Mike Stanton?
- Yeah. We went to law school together.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.177
He keeps calling.
He says he needs to talk to you.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.848
He's representing a Linda Bodum.
I had counsel pull a file.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.268
I know the case. She's allegedly retarded.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.604
Fell in with some lowlife
robbing cab drivers.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.772
- One died?
- She's on death row in Texas.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.858
And Mike wants the Supreme Court

06:39.941 --> 06:42.819
to hear an appeal based on
her diminished mental capacity.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.781
And the Court announced an hour ago
that they are not going to hear her appeal.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.952
So... what, he wants to come in
and get me to commute her sentence?

06:51.036 --> 06:53.622
- Motorcade's ready, Madam President.
- Thank you.

06:53.705 --> 06:57.417
- I'll tell him you're too busy.
- He's a friend. I have to call him back.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.544
It's just not what I needed today.

06:59.628 --> 07:03.214
I'll tell him that you'll call him back
next week, after the holiday.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.759
Supreme Court was her last appeal.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.970
The execution is scheduled
for the day after Thanksgiving.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.680
She'll be dead by next week.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.726
OK.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.259
- [Jim] It's a bad idea.
- He's an old friend from law school.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.345
I owe him the courtesy of a face-to-face.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.264
He's representing a killer
who's about to get the needle.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.810
A killer with an IQ hovering
somewhere around room temperature.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.603
If I put his name on the schedule,

07:58.687 --> 08:00.939
the entire press corps
is gonna be all over us.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.358
All we'll be talking about
is the death penalty.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.611
OK. Arrange a drop-by.
He gets a tour of the White House.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.489
I run into him,
we spend a few minutes in private,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.783
and then it's never on the schedule.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.954
In the world of drop-bys,
do you remember Jayne Murray?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.206
- Templeton's former chief of staff.
- Yeah.

08:18.289 --> 08:21.167
She's lobbying for related industries
on the base closure.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.545
- If you could give her five minutesâ€¦
- Of course.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.756
- Madam President, your mother arrived.
- Thank you, Laura.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.051
- In for Thanksgiving, right?
- Mm-hm.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.971
Nice to get a visit from someone
who's just here for turkey.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.472
You don't know my mother.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.061
- [knock on door]
- [Mac] Mom.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.855
- Oh, honey.
- Hey.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.440
- Oh, God.
- Hi.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.066
[laughing]

08:45.150 --> 08:48.194
- Oh, look at you.
- You got in early.

08:48.278 --> 08:52.699
Well, the escorts used the sirens
all the way from Connecticut. [chuckles]

08:52.782 --> 08:54.117
It was very effective.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.537
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, uh, still in school.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.081
They don't get off
for Thanksgiving till Wednesday.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.833
Which reminds me...

09:02.751 --> 09:04.878
I brought your favorite recipes.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.631
Oh, you know, I think
the kitchen staff has that covered.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.967
Oh, honey. I know how to handle help.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.386
Don't worry. They're gonna love me.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.221
They're not exactly "help," Mom.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.891
I... I know. They're "staff."

09:17.974 --> 09:21.978
I understand. They're professionals.
They're not used to interference.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.315
But, honey, I have been
cooking Thanksgiving dinner

09:25.398 --> 09:29.486
for my family for 50 years.
It's our tradition.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.946
Even without Dad.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.824
And as long as I'm standing,
I'm cooking.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.909
OK.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.248
I'll do this later.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.917
Show me your office.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.795
The Oval's still the same.
I haven't changed anything.

09:46.878 --> 09:50.465
Oh, yes, you have.
You're sitting behind the desk now.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.802
[both chuckling]

09:54.928 --> 09:57.847
You could use more
assertive colors in here.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.600
Uh, redecorating
is at the bottom of my list, Mom.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.144
I'm not talking at all about decor.

10:03.228 --> 10:07.065
It's a way to lift your leg
and establish your territory.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.609
The point is to mark your turf.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.946
I forgot how beautiful this woodwork is.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.906
- Just right in here, Mom.
- All right.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.328
Madam President.
I'm a little early, yes. Excuse me.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.997
- Nathan Templeton, Mrs. Allen.
- Hello, Mr. Speaker.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.666
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.668
Are you gonna give your mother a tour?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.295
Oh, no. I've already done that
with President Bridges.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.172
I was walking the president to work.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.299
Please. Don't let me interrupt. I'm early.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.260
I'll wait here while you do your visit.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.555
You certainly will not, sir.
You have business with the government.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.515
- Government runs slow.
- [laughs]

10:40.598 --> 10:43.226
But not because of the president's mother.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.104
- I'll see you later, dear.
- OK.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.440
- You're making me feel bad, Mrs. Allen.
- I doubt it.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.361
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Speaker.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.696
[Nathan] And you, and you.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.865
You're much handsomer
than your pictures.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.826
Your hair is beautiful,
just like my husband's.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.703
- Mr. Speaker?
- Last chance.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.913
[chuckling]

11:04.789 --> 11:06.791
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.670
- What were you doing just now?
- I was trying to make friends for you.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.881
Mom, I don't need any help with that.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.259
The longer we're here, the more
he'll think we're talking about him.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.468
Go.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.100
[door closes]

11:25.476 --> 11:27.937
- Your mother's very charming.
- Almost always.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.355
[both chuckling]

11:29.439 --> 11:32.275
She's right.
I've never taken a good picture.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.111
Are you going back
to your district for Thanksgiving?

11:35.195 --> 11:37.071
No. We're going to stay put this year.

11:37.155 --> 11:41.242
You know, the hurricane took the house,
and Sarah's had a tough week.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.871
Sorry to hear that. If she's up to it,
why don't you join us?

11:44.954 --> 11:47.790
It's just the family,
thought it would be better for the kids

11:47.874 --> 11:49.876
than, uh, having a big White House affair.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.920
No, no. It's your family dinner.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.672
There's always room
at the table at Thanksgiving.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.886
That's very kind of you.
Thank you. I'll... I'll ask Sarah.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.554
- See how she feels.
- Good.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.099
But you didn't call me in
to ask us to Thanksgiving.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.769
No. Please.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.907
The Essex Naval Base
is a relic of the Cold War.

12:20.990 --> 12:25.119
Closing it would save the military
1.7 billion dollars in the first year alone.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.455
Well, we could cook
those numbers any way we want.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.832
My people tell me
the domino effect on the economy

12:29.916 --> 12:31.793
could cost two billion over five years.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.672
Those are local numbers.
The BRAC report is very clear.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.258
There will be no
economic impact nationally.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.802
This affects my home community
and you know that.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.886
I do.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.306
You also know that Essex was never
supposed to be on the closure list.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.477
I had a deal with President Bridges.
A deal that you made a promise to honor.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.855
I made a promise. A personal
promise to Teddy, not to you.

12:55.525 --> 12:59.195
A community is at stake,
a community that I care about.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.949
And all I am asking of you
is to honor your original position.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.827
It's a position that I was
compelled to reconsider

13:05.910 --> 13:07.495
based on the merits of the report.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.164
This is just shuffling military money
back and forth.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.835
- Robbing Peter to pay Paul.
- It's sending money where it's needed.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.714
I had a meeting with the head of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and he was forthright.

13:17.797 --> 13:22.176
He said it was critical, sad but critical,
that we close these obsolete bases

13:22.260 --> 13:24.679
and release those funds
for fighter readiness,

13:24.762 --> 13:26.723
intelligence, homeland security...

13:26.806 --> 13:30.226
You really want to make this
where we draw our battle lines?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.061
You willing to die on this hill?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.023
Are you telling me

13:35.106 --> 13:38.484
that you're going to take the tape
out of the safe and make it public?

13:38.568 --> 13:40.653
I have no intention of using that tape.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.823
I can fight fair and win.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.535
Madam President,
I would expect nothing less from you,

13:47.618 --> 13:50.246
and you should expect
nothing less from me.

13:50.913 --> 13:54.042
- [Jayne] She's really gonna see me?
- Soon as Templeton leaves.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.836
Templeton's here? On base closure?

13:58.296 --> 14:00.965
The important thing
is that you're here, right?

14:01.049 --> 14:03.384
- Yeah.
- Don't be nervous.

14:03.468 --> 14:07.638
Three minutes with her can determine
the future of my career. Why be nervous?

14:09.307 --> 14:11.392
Do ask Sarah about Thanksgiving.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.728
- We'd love to have you.
- Yes, I will.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.939
- Thank you, Madam President.
- Shouldn't be more than a second.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.486
- Jayne. Jim.
- Mr. Speaker.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.738
Madam President.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.949
You remember my former
chief of staff, Jayne Murray.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.701
- Good to see you.
- You too.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.537
Jayne's just taken a cushy K Street job,

14:31.621 --> 14:34.540
probably lobbying your man here
on the base closings.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.418
Uh, ready for you
in the Roosevelt Room, Madam President.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.128
- Thank you.
- Will you walk with me?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.923
- Um...
- Actually, we're not quite through.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.134
And I need Jim for a minute. Walk with us?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.762
- Sure.
- Mr. Speaker.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.237
Thank you so much for meeting
with me, Madam President.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.614
I'm not meeting with you,
I'm walking with you.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.450
Walking and chatting.
Chatting and walking.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.954
- What would you care to chat about?
- Essex Naval Base.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.374
Um, we're doing work
with certain related industries...

15:16.457 --> 15:19.043
Who would take a substantial hit
if the base is closed.

15:19.127 --> 15:22.380
Undersea warfare could be critical
to our survival as a nation.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.257
It's not our only undersea base,

15:24.340 --> 15:27.343
just the only one your clients
happen to have a contract with.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.638
I have a brief on the impact
of the base closure.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.474
- Can I put it in your hands?
- Of course.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.812
Can I say I put it in your hands?

15:39.730 --> 15:42.150
Of course. Good luck
with your new position.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.901
Thank you, Madam President.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.824
[Vince] Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.244
She took the brief. I just became
the K Street lobbyist who put a brief

15:53.327 --> 15:55.371
directly into the hands of the president.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.040
That's great. Do you have a second?

16:05.298 --> 16:06.966
Jayne...

16:07.049 --> 16:08.801
...we can't keep seeing each other.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.888
When you were working
for Templeton it was barely ethical.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.266
Now that you're a lobbyist, it's... illegal.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.561
I know.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.355
It was nice, for awhile.

16:22.732 --> 16:23.941
Yeah.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.863
I can't believe she took the brief.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.158
I'm gonna miss you.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.118
We'll see each other all the time.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.287
I'll still miss you.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.294
[door opens]

16:53.888 --> 16:56.349
This is Chef Tom and Chef Carl

16:56.432 --> 16:58.601
and this is Chef Paul,
who's the dessert chef.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.520
Hello, Chef Paul. What an honorâ€¦

17:00.603 --> 17:03.481
- Look at these incredible dessert...
- Mrs. Allen.

17:03.564 --> 17:07.443
Hello, I'm Nora Woodruff.
I'm the first gentleman's chief of staff.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.570
- I would be delighted to show you around.
- Oh.

17:10.655 --> 17:14.325
The president's mother is going to be
cooking Thanksgiving dinner, Nora.

17:15.326 --> 17:18.621
Well, this isn't really
a domestic kitchen, Mrs. Allen.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.625
Oh, don't worry, Nora.
I know my way around BTUs.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.796
I have a restaurant range at home.
And I'm sure Chef Paul will help me.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.047
Well, actually...

17:28.130 --> 17:31.092
Mrs. Allen's always made
Thanksgiving dinner for the family.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.427
We're not gonna mess with tradition.

17:33.511 --> 17:37.098
It's just a family dinner.
There's no state protocol involved.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.309
- Would you like place cards written?
- That would be lovely.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.105
Oh, and individual menu cards?
We have little crystal holders.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.274
- Can you show me those?
- Right over here.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.317
Well, I know when I'm not needed.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.279
Now, what china pattern
do you think we should use, Nora?

17:51.362 --> 17:52.989
[sighs]

17:53.072 --> 17:55.241
- Right this way, Mr. Stanton.
- Thank you.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.536
The Roosevelt Room was the
original site of the president's office

17:58.619 --> 18:01.205
when the West Wing was built in 1902.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.667
Kennedy kept his fishing trophies
in here, didn't he?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.877
Watch out, Vince. Mike's a Kennedy buff.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.629
- He knows all the trivia.
- Mac.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.007
- Oh.
- Hey.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.342
- Madam President.
- [Mac chuckles]

18:13.426 --> 18:15.553
- Mike.
- Impressive.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.848
- I'm sorry I can't show you the Oval.
- I understand.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.642
I only have a few minutes.
I actually just snuck this in.

18:21.726 --> 18:24.353
Mac, I want you to commute
Linda Bodum's death sentence.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.355
Supreme Court denied your appeal.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.275
Presidents don't commute
state-mandated death sentences.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.819
Presidents can commute
any sentences they want.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.656
Look, come on. I can't unilaterally
revoke the death penalty,

18:35.740 --> 18:39.035
much as I might like to.
It's... It's just not realistic.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.831
Federal Crime Bill 18,
USCA Section 9536a:

18:43.914 --> 18:46.667
"A sentence of death shall not be
carried out upon a person

18:46.751 --> 18:49.754
who is mentally retarded."
They passed that 20 years ago, Mac.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.506
- All you do is cite the law of the land.
- It's not that easy.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.926
Linda Bodum has the mental acuity
of a five year old, Mac.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.388
She doesn't understand what's happening,
doesn't understand her crime

18:59.472 --> 19:02.058
and certainly doesn't
understand D.C. politics.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.185
It doesn't make them any less real, Mike.

19:05.519 --> 19:09.398
I told her I was gonna try to see
the president to save her life.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.734
I told her I knew you from school,

19:11.817 --> 19:14.737
and the woman that I knew
wouldn't let her die.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.239
- [sighs]
- She made you this, Mac.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.991
Oh, God.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.287
"Dear President, I don't want to die.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.415
Mr. Stanton says you are good.
I want to live..."

19:26.499 --> 19:28.000
This is beyond manipulative.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.252
- What choice do I have?
- What choice do I have?

19:30.336 --> 19:33.839
Come on, Mac. You're the
president of the United States.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.843
Don't be naive.
There is a reality to this office!

19:37.927 --> 19:39.303
Yeah.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.140
The reality that you hold her life
in your hands.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.185
I understand there may be political costs,

19:46.268 --> 19:50.231
but if you do nothing, you might as well
stick that needle in her arm yourself.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.196
- [Rod] What did you tell him?
- [Mac] I told him I can't do it.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.323
Supreme Court has spoken. States' rights.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.909
- You did the right thing.
- Why does it feel so lousy?

20:01.992 --> 20:05.204
He was imposing on an old friendship
and that's inappropriate.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.082
I would have done the same thing.
So would you.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.881
I keep thinking about that base back home.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.136
My head tells me, "Do nothing,
let it close, stay out of the fray."

20:20.219 --> 20:23.764
But my heart... We close that base,
we close a whole community.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.350
Well, you're not
the president of Connecticut.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.769
You've got a whole nation to worry about.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.314
- Do you think we should shut it down?
- Look.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.902
It would free up enough money to cover
the entire F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program

20:36.986 --> 20:40.239
with enough funds left over
for the rapid deployment expansion

20:40.322 --> 20:42.575
that you've been pushing.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.244
It feels lousy, it looks bad,

20:45.327 --> 20:47.496
but it may be the best move.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.750
Mmm. I don't know.

20:50.833 --> 20:55.087
I thought with this job I'd have
more chances to do the right thing.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.672
You do.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.717
It's just...

20:59.800 --> 21:03.721
The right thing isn't always
the opposite of the wrong thing.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.692
Does Mommy know that you
gave me chocolate milk?

21:16.776 --> 21:19.779
Well, and fruit and cereal, Bunny.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.989
We'll tell her chocolate's brain food.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.534
No, that actually is true.
I would never lie to your mother.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.996
Why am I even studying French?
This whole world speaks English.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.664
This is so stupid.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.833
- Good morning, Becky.
- Morning.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.545
If you'd taken French instead of Spanish,
you could help me, Becca.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.715
What happened to your eyes?
They're all black.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.176
Do I have to talk
this early in the morning?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.928
Can't I just eat breakfast?

21:44.845 --> 21:46.514
I studied French.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.558
So, can you conjugate
the past subjunctive of venir

21:49.642 --> 21:52.686
- in the first person plural?
- [speaks French]

21:52.770 --> 21:57.358
The present subjunctive of
the auxiliary plus the past participle.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.027
- OK. I'm an idiot.
- [chuckles]

22:00.110 --> 22:02.696
- Thanks, Grandma.
- [speaks French]

22:02.780 --> 22:04.865
- Good morning.
- Good morning, everyone.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.700
Good morning, everyone. My baby boy.

22:06.784 --> 22:10.454
- Hey. Hi, baby. Mom.
- Darling.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.124
- I like the way I look, OK?
- Fine.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.214
That's Linda Bodum's mother

22:20.297 --> 22:22.591
leading a prayer vigil outside the prison.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.135
Uh, Becca, could you
pass the milk, please?

22:25.219 --> 22:27.471
- Yeah. Sure.
- The whole idea

22:27.555 --> 22:32.810
that the government can kill your child
and you can't do a damn thing to stop it.

22:32.893 --> 22:37.064
Grandma doesn't mean a little girl, baby.
She's talking about a 30-year-old woman.

22:37.147 --> 22:40.067
- With a subnormal IQ.
- Who was convicted of murder.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.404
And the state of Texas is gonna
return evil for evil and murder her?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.406
- It's not murder, Grandma.
- No? Why not?

22:45.489 --> 22:50.077
Well... Because murder is unjustified.
And this, this is completely justified.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.454
The woman shot
a taxi driver who had a family...

22:52.538 --> 22:53.831
Unless she didn't.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.251
- Oh, please.
- No. We talked about this in civics.

22:57.334 --> 23:00.129
They couldn't prove whether
it was her or her boyfriend.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.424
- Either way she's guilty.
- Right. Props for compassion, Becca.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.926
- What grade do you have in civics?
- [Rod taps glass]

23:06.010 --> 23:09.805
We can finish arguing about this
on the way to school. Time to go.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.517
- See you, Grandma.
- Goodbye, dear.

23:13.601 --> 23:14.810
Bye.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.940
How are they going to kill her?

23:20.024 --> 23:23.444
Well, first they strap her
to a kind of table with wheels.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.488
The doctor's going to put a needle
in the big vein in her arm...

23:26.572 --> 23:28.365
Mom. You've made your point.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.619
I was answering Amy's question.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.747
She has a right to get an answer.
I always answered your questions.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.957
Come on, baby.
Get your backpack. Let's go.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.294
Does it hurt?

23:40.377 --> 23:42.880
Nobody knows. The dead don't talk.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.174
Oh, God. Come on.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.886
Say "Bye-bye, Grandma."

23:48.969 --> 23:51.639
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye, honey.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.223
Morning.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.394
Since you got here,
all I'm getting is speculation

23:57.478 --> 23:59.897
on "Is she running?"
and "When's she announcing?"

23:59.980 --> 24:01.774
- I like that.
- I'm sure that you do,

24:01.857 --> 24:04.568
but there's only so much
I can vamp from the podium.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.237
Your vamping polls higher than you think.

24:07.321 --> 24:10.699
- Uh, you polled my vamping?
- I poll everything.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.994
Guys, how's prep coming
for tomorrow's press conference?

24:14.078 --> 24:16.163
We can't really prep
until we have a policy.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.999
- How's she on the base closures?
- Still considering.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.168
I hope she makes up
her mind by tomorrow,

24:21.251 --> 24:24.922
unless she has a press conference
to announce she can't make up her mind.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.174
- How will that poll, Dickie?
- All right, Jim,

24:27.257 --> 24:29.176
would you like to handle it
until we know?

24:29.259 --> 24:31.762
We'll split staff.
Have teams prepping both ways.

24:32.763 --> 24:34.598
- About your numbers...
- My numbers?

24:34.682 --> 24:37.851
You're testing in the 8s and 9s
on warmth and relate-ability,

24:37.935 --> 24:40.354
but you're lower
on judgment and confidence.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.898
- What?
- We need to talk about your hair.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.360
Get rid of the girl-next-door look.
Go more sexy, sophisticated.

24:46.443 --> 24:50.030
Is it really my hair that needs
to be sophisticated in this job?

24:50.114 --> 24:51.573
Wardrobe and makeup too.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.536
There's a reason no one's done a style
piece on President Allen's new press sec.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.038
Give this guy a call. He's the best.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.165
Rod.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.835
Someone has a fan.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.420
- Can we steal you?
- Yeah.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.047
Um, Rod tells me you have
no plans for Thanksgiving.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.299
- You'll join us?
- Thank you.

25:10.718 --> 25:14.430
Uh, Dickie had a concern. I told him
he shouldn't hold anything back.

25:14.513 --> 25:18.517
Um, somehow I think holding back
has never been his issue.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.186
- No, ma'am.
- What's on your mind?

25:22.312 --> 25:25.274
You met with Linda Bodum's attorney.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.734
It's not out, but I saw him.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.653
Figured he wasn't here
for the White House tour.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.406
Seventy percent of Americans
support the death penalty.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.867
Unless the poll gives
an option of life in prison,

25:34.950 --> 25:37.536
in which case the number
drops to 41 percent.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.415
Texas is 34 electoral votes.

25:41.498 --> 25:44.001
Not to mention the rest
of the South and Midwest.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.503
Day may come
when you wish you had them.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.681
Kate?

25:59.683 --> 26:00.976
[Kate chuckles]

26:01.060 --> 26:04.730
- Don't worry, I'm still breathing.
- Me too.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.523
That's the definition of a good day.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.526
- Ah. Come and sit for a minute.
- OK.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.696
Oh.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.286
- Are you all right?
- Mmm.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.955
- I'm sorry about this morning.
- Ah.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.916
I thought I was preaching to the choir.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.460
I mean, where is Rebecca
getting her ideas?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.462
Not from either of her parents.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.881
Kate, I'm glad you're here.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.971
President Allen. Madam President.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.849
- My daughter, the president.
- [chuckles]

26:40.933 --> 26:44.603
Do you know, I remember when
I couldn't open a checking account

26:44.686 --> 26:46.980
- without my husband's signature.
- Right.

26:47.064 --> 26:50.609
Oh, Michael would be
so thrilled to see her now.

26:51.819 --> 26:55.405
He bragged about her
from the day she was born.

26:57.241 --> 27:00.494
Everybody says you get used to loss.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.041
I miss him more every day.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.211
Kateâ€¦

27:14.675 --> 27:16.718
You spend too much time in that house.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.514
Oh. There's nowhere to go.
And nobody to go with.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.224
Well, what about all your friends?

27:22.307 --> 27:25.394
They can't see and they can't hear
and they can't walk.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.854
[stammering]

27:26.937 --> 27:29.231
Going to lunch is like a major expedition,

27:29.314 --> 27:32.901
and once we get there all we do
is talk about our medical problems.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.320
Oh, come on.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.867
I remember...

27:39.950 --> 27:43.579
...bullying Michael into having
a vacation in Hawaii.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.998
Right, right. [chuckles]

27:47.207 --> 27:49.751
After one day, he said doctors should send

27:49.835 --> 27:52.546
all their terminally ill patients to Hawaii

27:52.629 --> 27:56.300
because being there one day
was like a year.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.887
Getting old is like a vacation in Hawaii.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.848
- Come on.
- Oh.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.933
I get depressed when it's dark.

28:05.017 --> 28:08.145
- I'll be much better in the morning.
- Sure you will.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.029
- Pleasant dreams.
- Good night.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.576
[sighs]

28:33.378 --> 28:35.047
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.843
It's 7:00am and you look tired.
What's going on?

28:39.927 --> 28:41.428
I've been up since 5:00.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.640
I've been, uh, looking over
Linda Bodum's case.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.726
Now you're not seriously
considering commutation?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.728
Yeah. I am.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.940
Honey, you're just
handing yourself up on a platter

28:53.023 --> 28:54.316
with an apple in your mouth.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.945
I'm already sick of this campaign
before I've even agreed to run.

28:58.028 --> 29:02.241
I can't make a decision like this,
between my life and her life.

29:02.324 --> 29:05.285
You're asking me to compromise
before I'm even out of the gate.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.079
If you intend to stay president.

29:07.162 --> 29:11.083
Why have the job if the only point
is keeping the job, not doing the job?

29:11.166 --> 29:13.252
Don't pretend you're above politics, Mac,

29:13.335 --> 29:15.420
or you'd have resigned when Bridges died

29:15.504 --> 29:17.673
and this'd be
Templeton's bedroom right now.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.841
I have the power to save that woman's life.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.844
You weren't present at the trial.
You didn't hear the evidence.

29:22.928 --> 29:26.682
- You want to subvert this jury's decision?
- I have that right.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.141
Nice.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.813
Three thousand people on death row.
Will you commute all their sentences?

29:32.896 --> 29:35.357
- This is different.
- Why? Because she's retarded?

29:35.440 --> 29:38.527
Because she's a woman?
Because you had a thing with her lawyer?

29:40.195 --> 29:43.991
- I didn't. He was just a friend.
- A close friend.

29:45.075 --> 29:48.495
Do you really want
to trump the Supreme Court?

29:57.337 --> 30:00.340
[Nathan] The president's invited us
for Thanksgiving dinner

30:00.424 --> 30:04.219
in the private dining room.
Just the family. Her mother's in town.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.932
I saw the mother on TV. She's attractive.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.684
It's all spackle and paint.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.729
[chuckles] Some of us need that.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.230
You never did.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.191
I know what she wants.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.527
Girl's so transparent, Sarah.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.279
She didn't invite us for company.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.866
She wants to send a message
that I support her presidency,

30:25.949 --> 30:29.494
that we're friends. I told her
in Washington there are no friends.

30:29.578 --> 30:30.954
[sighs]

30:31.788 --> 30:34.458
I'm not going to let her use me this way.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.044
She thinks she's so canny.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.173
- Does she?
- [chuckles]

30:41.256 --> 30:44.051
Because she's really smart.
Don't underestimate her.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.264
Too bad you lost your inside source.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.394
I shouldn't have fired Jayne.

30:55.479 --> 30:59.524
Jayne was an excellent chief of staff.
You won't find any better.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.610
And you know you miss her.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.490
Well... [sighs] I can't hire her back.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.241
Why not?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.204
Because I'd have to beg.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.914
[chuckles]

31:13.997 --> 31:16.792
It's just a tactic, sweetheart.

31:22.506 --> 31:25.467
For Thanksgiving,
shall I wear the black suit

31:25.550 --> 31:28.095
or shall I wear the velvet pants
with the jacket?

31:30.639 --> 31:34.017
- We do have to go, don't we?
- You like the velvet pants.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.437
Whatever you wear...

31:37.521 --> 31:40.607
...you're going to be the most
beautiful woman at the table.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.151
I love you too.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.114
- I have an idea.
- Start by apologizing.

31:47.197 --> 31:49.908
- I'm sorry.
- That was too easy.

31:49.991 --> 31:53.286
What do you think about having
your mother live at the White House?

31:53.370 --> 31:55.288
- With us?
- Yes.

31:55.372 --> 31:58.125
- Have you already talked to her?
- No, I have not.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.961
But we need an official hostess,
Mac. She'd be perfect.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.380
- She could write an etiquette book.
- In French.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.133
Right. She's like Jackie Kennedy
without the pillbox.

32:06.216 --> 32:09.845
And a much louder voice.
She knows how to make herself heard.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.597
You know, in Connecticut,
we can ignore her.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.975
She's desperately lonely there, Mac.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.394
- She never said that.
- Not to you.

32:17.477 --> 32:20.063
But she thinks you have
enough to worry about.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.857
You know, with the nation.

32:21.940 --> 32:26.194
But she's all by herself.
She's just going to start fading away.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.614
And the kids need more attention,
Mac. You know they do.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.826
Are you really ready to start living
with your mother-in-law?

32:32.909 --> 32:35.203
Well, it's a very large house.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.705
[camera shutters clicking]

32:36.788 --> 32:38.498
I'm ready to take questions now.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.209
- Madam President! Madam President!
- [Mac] Luis.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.170
[Luis] The closure of Essex Naval

32:43.253 --> 32:46.131
could have a huge impact
on citizens in your home state.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.216
Will you fight to keep the base open?

32:48.300 --> 32:50.510
I grew up on that base.

32:50.594 --> 32:54.222
I had my birthday parties
at the bowling alley there every year.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.558
This is personal for me

32:56.641 --> 32:59.644
and I've agonized over it.

32:59.728 --> 33:04.024
And that's why the commission
on closures is independent.

33:04.107 --> 33:07.777
Their recommendations
are above personal feelings and politics

33:07.861 --> 33:11.907
and will move billions of dollars
into critical national security programs.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.700
- Madam President!
- Terry.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.952
Do you worry turning
your back on these people

33:16.036 --> 33:19.331
- will cost you support in your home state?
- I'm not turning my back.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.541
We're preparing
economic assistance plans

33:21.625 --> 33:25.337
that will help these communities
adjust and attract new industry.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.216
[Terry] Are you sending a signal that
running in the next election isn't a factor?

33:29.966 --> 33:33.678
Right now I'm concentrating on being
president, not running for president.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.097
Does that mean you're not going to run?

33:37.224 --> 33:39.601
- Madam President! Madam President!
- Barry.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.270
Forty percent of students
at your elementary school

33:42.354 --> 33:44.022
are children of base personnel.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.359
Does it bother you that your school
may have to shut its doors

33:47.442 --> 33:50.195
- because of this decision?
- [Mac] Yes. Of course it does.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.156
And I'll do everything I can
to see that that doesn't happen.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.951
But I'm not gonna
play favorites from this office,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.036
not even for my hometown.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.830
The right decision
isn't always the easy one,

34:00.914 --> 34:03.500
but it doesn't make it any less right.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.546
- [reporters clamoring]
- What do you think?

34:07.629 --> 34:10.215
I think she'll make a hell of a candidate.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.973
Let's assume I decide to run.
What will you need from me?

34:18.056 --> 34:21.101
Focus. Time. You have
to be serious about fundraising.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.770
You don't have the benefit
of an RNC or DNC behind you.

34:23.853 --> 34:27.857
No infrastructure. Cost of that alone
will be north of 300 million.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.443
Same for the campaign itself.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.530
We're probably talking about
raising a million dollars a day.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.283
I'll also need to be on the team
formulating the message.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.827
If you are on the team,
I'd have some ground rules.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.581
You'd have input, but ultimately
the message would be mine.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.292
- Of course.
- You're a talented guy.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.295
I'm glad Rod brought you in.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.964
But you're not going to make me
into some product to sell.

34:52.047 --> 34:55.260
I won't be handled, I won't be made over.

34:55.342 --> 34:58.179
Madam President, if you hire me,
I'll be working for you.

34:58.263 --> 35:02.058
I'll call it how I see it, but ultimately
every decision will be yours.

35:04.894 --> 35:08.231
You strike me as a rather
mercenary young man.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.275
Ambitious. Good at what you do.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.110
- But you like to win.
- Always.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.529
Then why are you here?
I'm in this job by accident.

35:14.613 --> 35:18.325
I have no party support.
My numbers are sliding.

35:18.408 --> 35:21.077
I am a long shot for re-election.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.501
My first job out of college
was for Congressman Leland.

35:28.585 --> 35:31.671
While he was setting fundraising records

35:31.755 --> 35:33.798
from every sleazebag in America...

35:33.882 --> 35:35.800
Yeah, you resigned.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.678
Because campaign finance reform
was going down in flames

35:38.762 --> 35:41.973
and you said you didn't want
to be a part of a corrupt system

35:42.057 --> 35:43.433
that couldn't heal itself.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.021
I'd have thought you'd say that
that was a dumb move.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.899
You shamed them into
passing campaign finance reform.

35:50.982 --> 35:54.569
It wouldn't have happened otherwise.
Sort of made you a hero in my book.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.613
You think I'm a hero?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.951
I think you can win this, Madam President.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.040
Do you have someplace
to go for Thanksgiving?

36:17.258 --> 36:19.511
Wow. This looks beautiful, Mom.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.638
[chuckling]

36:21.721 --> 36:25.558
I put you and Rod across from
each other in the middle of the table.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.311
Just like William Randolph Hearst
and Marion Davies.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.856
Well, except happy
and married to each other.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.984
That way Mr. Templeton
is seated to your right.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.529
Does his wife need
any special accommodation?

36:37.612 --> 36:40.532
- Not that I know of.
- Oh, well. I have her next to Rod.

36:40.615 --> 36:44.077
That works. And the youngsters
are together at the end of the table.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.870
- Great. Great.
- Good.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.123
- You love this, don't you?
- I do.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.167
- I haven't had so much fun in years.
- [Mac chuckles]

36:52.168 --> 36:53.753
You should, uh...

36:53.837 --> 36:57.340
You should close up the Connecticut
house and move in here with us.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.137
- Be careful. I just might accept.
- I'm serious, Mom.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.932
- I want to have you here with us.
- Are you feeling sorry for me?

37:06.015 --> 37:07.559
We need you, Mom.

37:07.642 --> 37:10.979
- Is this your idea or Rod's?
- We discussed it together.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.355
Spoken like a president.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.318
- I'll think about it.
- OK.

37:22.991 --> 37:26.661
You're not just going
after the senior vote, are you?

37:26.745 --> 37:29.581
Ah. That hadn't occurred to me.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.338
[jazz music playing]

37:39.549 --> 37:42.135
- [Nathan] Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.471
- Welcome, Nathan.
- Sorry we're a little late.

37:44.554 --> 37:45.930
[Mac] No, you're not.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.892
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.604
We're, uh, gathering at the West End.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.606
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:55.231 --> 37:56.858
I watched your press conference.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.486
You were right.
It was the only decision possible.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.238
You continue to amaze me.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.116
I have something for you.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.744
Yeah, but we didn't bring...
I didn't bring any...

38:07.827 --> 38:10.538
I'm giving you the original film

38:10.622 --> 38:13.541
- and the tape.
- Why?

38:13.625 --> 38:17.045
If I decide to run for re-election,
not that I haveâ€¦

38:17.128 --> 38:18.421
Of course not.

38:18.505 --> 38:21.216
- ...you'll run against me.
- That's an assumption.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.343
Assuming you do,

38:23.426 --> 38:26.221
I'm going to beat you
because of what you believe now,

38:26.304 --> 38:27.764
not what you said then.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.100
Thank you.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.025
- Madam President.
- Dickie, happy Thanksgiving.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.735
[Nathan] Happy Thanksgiving.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.655
You look beautiful, Kelly. As always.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.575
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Be careful. You'll be next,

38:47.659 --> 38:50.203
and it won't be just another new hairstyle.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.038
- Madam President.
- Excuse me.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.706
The governor's been reached.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.792
- He's waiting on the line.
- Thank you.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.462
My daughter has invited me
to live in the White House.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.465
- How nice.
- She needs me here.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.801
You've made your feelings quite clear.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.929
I've taken note of your position,
but it doesn't change mine.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.390
Tomorrow you will receive
my executive order

39:10.473 --> 39:13.476
commuting Miss Bodum's sentence
to life in prison.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.896
I'd like to wish you and your family
a very happy Thanksgiving.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.773
Good night.

39:22.569 --> 39:23.820
You called the governor.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.242
I had to pardon the National Turkey
in the Rose Garden this week.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.619
It gets to live its life
out on a farm somewhere.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.664
Does Linda Bodum deserve
any less compassion than a turkey?

39:36.374 --> 39:40.503
Well, if you're gonna go down, honey,
at least you're gonna go down fighting.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.675
- Come on. Everybody's waiting for you.
- OK.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.556
[classical music playing]

39:55.894 --> 39:58.813
[Dickie] You should know.
Your mother tests off the charts.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.648
You just made that up.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.318
OK, you're right, but when
I get the results tomorrow,

40:03.401 --> 40:06.946
her positives will hit within two points
of 85 percent across the board.

40:07.030 --> 40:10.116
No party split. You'll need a new
picture for the Christmas card.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.076
Three generations in the White House.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.287
[chuckles] Go sit down.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.042
Doesn't she look fantastic?

40:21.002 --> 40:23.004
- Madam President.
- Please, everyone.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.559
Nathan, will you do us
the honor of saying grace?

41:02.335 --> 41:03.836
Lord...

41:03.920 --> 41:06.965
...we thank you for the bounty
we are about to receive

41:07.048 --> 41:09.217
and for the hands that prepared it.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.095
On this day of giving thanks...

41:13.221 --> 41:15.890
...let us give thanks
to our families who love us,

41:15.974 --> 41:18.518
to our friends who stand by us,

41:18.601 --> 41:22.397
to our enemies who forgive us,

41:22.480 --> 41:27.068
and to our leaders
who need your strength, Lord,

41:27.151 --> 41:29.737
your compassion and mercy,

41:29.821 --> 41:33.241
to do your work and theirs.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.076
Amen.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.411
- Amen.
- Amen.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.537
Happy Thanksgiving.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.580
[all] Happy Thanksgiving.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.502
That was lovely. Thank you.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.255
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh!

41:47.338 --> 41:50.216
[Nathan] Bravo! Bravo.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.468
They're beautiful, Grandma.
