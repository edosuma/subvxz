Okay, you yelled at me, so I'm

Dad, I have, like, an issue with

09:46.033 --> 09:48.667
betrayal because I knew what it
felt like.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.233

why you're mean to Mom?

09:51.233 --> 09:54.133
'Cause you're mad at her?

09:54.133 --> 09:56.233

talking about it all day

09:56.233 --> 09:58.233
yesterday.
>> KHLOE: Mom (bleep) you in so

09:58.233 --> 10:01.633
many ways?
>> KOURTNEY: Lately, in therapy,

10:01.633 --> 10:05.266
a lot of topics that have been
coming up are about childhood

10:05.266 --> 10:12.166
issues and how that affects so
many of my relationships today.

10:15.133 --> 10:16.700

10:16.700 --> 10:20.266
>> KOURTNEY: I told you, Larsa.
If I had a problem, I wouldn't

10:20.266 --> 10:23.266
go to her, ever. Did you?
>> LARSA: But if you had a

10:23.266 --> 10:25.166
problem, she'd be there.
>> KOURTNEY: I don't know.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.166
Did you? 'Cause I didn't.
>> KHLOE: I don't go to anyone.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.000
I'm like...
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, but...

10:29.000 --> 10:30.700
>> KHLOE: But Kylie and Kim go
to Mom all the time, so, like,

10:30.700 --> 10:32.000
she is available...
>> KOURTNEY: Okay. To them.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000

need her.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.200

her.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.000

great mom.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.166
>> KOURTNEY: I would go to Dad.
That's fine.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.000
>> KHLOE: Oh.
>> KOURTNEY: I just said she was

10:40.000 --> 10:44.066

comfort in.

I don't have my phone on me.

>> KHLOE: I think she thinks
she's, like, speaking her truth

12:54.133 --> 12:56.100
more and she's-- 'cause she
says, "I've been

12:56.100 --> 12:59.300
nonconfrontational for the past
"ten years and now I'm finding

12:59.300 --> 13:01.367

means, but if she feels that
way, that's good.

she's blaming you specifically.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.133
>> KHLOE: She probably felt like
she was always picking a side

13:23.133 --> 13:26.400
and it was always my dad's.
In the divorce, she always

13:26.400 --> 13:28.300
picked his.
>> KRIS: Yeah. She did.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.133

picked his.

Okay, that's fine, but let's

they're in.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.467
up the negative?

14:43.467 --> 14:45.333
where she pinched me when she
was a teenager.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.367

she scratched you.

scratch if I'm still carrying it

14:49.467 --> 14:51.467
around at 62.

14:51.467 --> 14:54.100

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
got brought up from me going
to therapy.

31:10.300 --> 31:15.200
What we usually do as a family
is we criticize each other,

31:15.200 --> 31:17.467
we're judgmental, and we give
each other an attitude and

31:17.467 --> 31:22.367
we're bitchy.
So, moving forward in life, I've

31:22.367 --> 31:28.100
made it a point with my sisters
already to, like, not accept

31:28.100 --> 31:31.200
that anymore.
>> KRIS: All I want for you is

31:31.200 --> 31:37.467
your-- the best, most joyful,
peaceful life that you can have.

31:37.467 --> 31:40.500
And whatever it takes for me to
be a part of that, that's all I

31:40.500 --> 31:44.333
want.
That's the joy of my life, is

31:44.333 --> 31:47.767
you guys.
I have nothing else.

31:47.767 --> 31:51.233
Just, I never want you to be
disappointed in me...

31:51.233 --> 31:53.066
>> KOURTNEY: I'm not.
>> KRIS: ...so if there's

31:53.066 --> 31:56.000
something you want to say, or
something that, you know, you

31:56.000 --> 32:01.100
need to have me work on, I'm
100% ready to work on it because

32:01.100 --> 32:03.533
I love you so much.
You're my firstborn, and I

32:03.533 --> 32:05.367
wouldn't trade that for
anything.

32:05.367 --> 32:08.400
I don't want you to be
disappointed in me, and if

32:08.400 --> 32:11.233
there's something that, you
know, you ever want to talk

32:11.233 --> 32:16.233
about, I just want you to
remember that I just want you to

32:16.233 --> 32:21.266

That's all I care about.

So...
>> KOURTNEY: Moving forward, I'm

32:23.266 --> 32:27.266
gonna just tell you if some-- if
I don't like something, or if

32:27.266 --> 32:31.500
something is hurtful or whatever
instead of, like, just being a

32:31.500 --> 32:33.400
bitch about it.
>> KRIS: Okay.

32:33.400 --> 32:36.500
>> KOURTNEY: A lot is still up
in the air, but, you know, I've

32:36.500 --> 32:40.400
gone through a phase of being,
like, more sensitive to things.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.400
It's nothing bad, it's just
understanding and then

32:43.400 --> 32:46.533
understanding how that affects
our current relationships.

32:46.533 --> 32:50.266
Like, if there's a certain
behavior that, like, Younes will

32:50.266 --> 32:53.533
do or something that's similar
to things that my mom would do,

32:53.533 --> 32:57.166
just, like, subconsciously, it
will just bring up similar

32:57.166 --> 32:59.033
issues.
There is, like, that

32:59.033 --> 33:03.200
uncomfortable place when you are

myself.

could take her bed out of my

41:27.000 --> 41:29.033
room.
Whenever I would come back from

41:29.033 --> 41:33.533
Cleveland, Gabbana would be
there and she was just my buddy.

41:33.533 --> 41:37.000
But now whenever I come back
from Cleveland I'll have a baby.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.734
I'm grateful that Gabbana left
me at a time where she knew I

41:40.734 --> 41:42.767
wouldn't be alone.
>> COREY: Well, have you seen

41:42.767 --> 41:44.700
the facilities yet, where you're
giving birth?

41:44.700 --> 41:46.633
>> KHLOE: No.
>> KOURTNEY: Don't go see them

41:46.633 --> 41:47.767
in advance.
>> KHLOE: Why?

41:47.767 --> 41:49.700
>> KOURTNEY: 'Cause it's not a
good idea.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.133
>> SCOTT: You know what the
rooms look like.

41:51.133 --> 41:52.734
>> KOURTNEY: She's not giving
birth there.

41:52.734 --> 41:54.500
>> KHLOE: I'm not giving birth
at Cedars.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.100
>> SCOTT: So you should go look.
>> KOURTNEY: No.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.500
The first time, we didn't look.
I had no clue what was

41:58.500 --> 42:00.166
happening and it's so much
better that way.

42:00.166 --> 42:01.700
>> SCOTT: Is it?
>> KHLOE: Tim went this weekend

42:01.700 --> 42:04.567
and assessed it all.
>> SCOTT: Okay.

42:04.567 --> 42:07.700
>> KRIS: Kylie!
>> KOURTNEY: Hi, Ky. Hi, Stormi.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.700
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God!
Hey, bo-bo. Mwah.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.567
>> KIM: Oh, my goodness.
>> KHLOE: Ours are gonna be

42:12.567 --> 42:14.166
twins, I think.
>> KIM: Oh, she just gave me the

42:14.166 --> 42:15.567
craziest side-eye.
Did you see that?

42:15.567 --> 42:16.700
>> KYLIE: Yeah, she's...
>> KIM: She literally went like

42:16.700 --> 42:18.700
this.
>> KYLIE: 'Cause she knows you

42:18.700 --> 42:21.233
kissed me first before my mom.
>> KHLOE: And she'll never let

42:21.233 --> 42:23.200
that down.
>> KENDALL: What happened?

42:23.200 --> 42:25.200
>> KHLOE: Kim got to kiss her
before Kylie did.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.734
>> KIM: It was, like, days
later.

42:26.734 --> 42:28.600
Who knew that she didn't kiss
her on the mouth?

42:28.600 --> 42:30.667
>> KYLIE: She was like, "Ooh!"
And jokingly was like, "Ooh,

42:30.667 --> 42:32.767
look, I'm your first kiss," and
kissed her, and I was like...

42:32.767 --> 42:34.767
(gasps)
>> KHLOE: Kylie's like, "That is

42:34.767 --> 42:38.767
not funny."
>> KIM: Stop. Will you text that

42:38.767 --> 42:40.600
to me?
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.000
>> KENDALL: Let me see.
>> KIM: We're gonna have, like,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.667
a book of, like, the triplets.
>> KYLIE: I know.

42:46.667 --> 42:49.066
>> KIM: Okay, so now that it's,
like, all said and done...

42:49.066 --> 42:50.734
>> KYLIE: Mm-hmm.
>> KIM: ...what is your real

42:50.734 --> 42:53.734
take on pregnancy?
>> KYLIE: I like it. I miss it.

42:53.734 --> 42:55.734
>> KIM: You miss it?
>> KYLIE: Yeah, I had, like, the

42:55.734 --> 42:57.734
easiest pregnancy ever.
Like, you just feel-- you never

42:57.734 --> 43:01.066
feel alone and, like, I was
really sad to not be pregnant

43:01.066 --> 43:03.100
anymore.
>> KIM: That's so cute.

43:03.100 --> 43:05.533
>> KYLIE: Khloe, I'm just so
excited for you.

43:05.533 --> 43:07.233
I can't wait.
>> KRIS: I'd like to raise a

43:07.233 --> 43:12.633
glass and make a toast to Khloe,
another little Kardashian that

43:12.633 --> 43:15.233
you're bringing into the world.
Next there'll be nine.

43:15.233 --> 43:18.166
>> KOURTNEY: Cheers, everyone.
>> ALL: Cheers.

43:18.166 --> 43:20.667
>> KOURTNEY: Yay to Khloe.
>> KYLIE: Cheers to Khloe.

43:20.667 --> 43:23.033
Stormi's not gonna be the new
girl in town anymore.

43:23.033 --> 43:25.133
>> KIM: Chicago was, like, the
new girl in town for, like, a

43:25.133 --> 43:26.700
day.
>> KYLIE: Two weeks.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.667
>> KOURTNEY: And now Stormi's
got three months, maybe, as the

43:28.667 --> 43:31.133
new girl.
>> KYLIE: Anyone else pregnant?

43:31.133 --> 43:35.100
>> KRIS: Nope. Not me. I'm good.
>> KIM: Nope, but...

43:35.100 --> 43:37.567
>> COREY: Wait a minute. Wait,
wait, if you get...

43:37.567 --> 43:42.133
>> KIM: Just kidding.
(laughter)

43:42.133 --> 43:44.166
Keeping Up
With the Kardashians...

43:44.166 --> 43:46.700
>> WOMAN: You're always working
and you need to have a better

43:46.700 --> 43:50.066
work-life balance.
>> WOMAN: To our world tour.

43:50.066 --> 43:53.600
>> WOMAN 2: Our world tour.
>> KENDALL: Tour.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.300
>> KHLOE: Are you and Kanye
good?

43:55.300 --> 43:59.600
>> KIM: We had a fight 'cause I
wouldn't get him a Band-Aid.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.266
>> KHLOE: Kim, like, you
completely left Kourtney on that

44:02.266 --> 44:04.266
(bleep) e-mail.
>> KIM: I was talking about

44:04.266 --> 44:06.300
Kourtney in the e-mail as if she
wasn't on the e-mail.
