Shoo, you sign of there not being
any customers, you!

00:56.431 --> 00:57.641
Okay, Dad.

00:57.975 --> 01:02.271
We painted your face all over the valley
to attract customers like you asked.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.530
Hey, this space belongs
to Bow-Chicka-Wow-Wow!

01:11.613 --> 01:14.199
Sorry. I'll tell my boys to stop.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.803
Don't stop. I need my face on more butts.
The bigger the better.

01:18.620 --> 01:23.041
Baitsy, your head's been chewed on a lot.
Surely you need help.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.127
Yes and yes.

A lightning bug flew up my nose
and got stuck.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.839

01:30.382 --> 01:32.509
Good thing we have such a great leader.

my good man?

01:49.359 --> 01:51.570
I'm unsanitary.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.156
Oh, sorry.
We gave our best food to Grug

01:54.239 --> 01:57.326
to thank him for leading us through
an epic gathering crisis.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.119

[Grug] My fellow Ahhh-Valleyites,

02:10.589 --> 02:15.385
I've been leader for a while now,
so let's address the state of the valley.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.554
It's awesome!

02:17.638 --> 02:19.765
[cheering]

02:20.557 --> 02:23.143
I've kept us safe, hunting is booming,

02:23.226 --> 02:25.228
cliff-related falls have plummeted,

02:25.312 --> 02:29.149
and I've rescued you all
from countless predators.

02:29.232 --> 02:36.156
So today, to celebrate my true greatness,
new pelts for all!

02:44.247 --> 02:46.291
Yeah, the egg got smashed!

02:46.375 --> 02:50.087
Also, the community has been righteous
under Grug's leadership.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.546
Yeah!

02:51.630 --> 02:53.382
How can you all cheer for him?

02:53.465 --> 02:55.133
He's not that great.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.345
Ha! Did you not see the egg
just get smashed?

02:58.428 --> 03:04.351
Like, for example, he's nearly put
my advice stand out of business.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.063
Wait. So he's a bad leader
because he's too helpful?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.146
Precisely.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.566
Plus, it's cold.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.486
He's done an awful job
negotiating with the sun.

03:14.569 --> 03:18.323
Hey, our talks are ongoing.
You can't be too careful in a cold war.

03:18.407 --> 03:21.618
Look, if you have a problem,
I'll solve it. Thunk, pelt him.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.744
[inhaling]

03:24.287 --> 03:28.917
And another thing.
You never let me finish my complain...

03:29.000 --> 03:33.296
It's here. Run, hide,
do whatever it takes to survive.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.048
Women and weird old dudes first.

- Okay, I'm a-coming.
- I said weird old dudes.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.345
And there I go!

03:41.388 --> 03:42.556
What is it, Old Man Root?

03:42.639 --> 03:45.642
The Big Chickuna. It is back.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.603
Well, we've dealt with it before, so...

03:48.687 --> 03:50.605
What did we do the last time again?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.583
Is that the one
where we dressed up as a bear owl?

03:52.607 --> 03:55.402
No. We hastily invented a new device
we never used again.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.779
[Baitsy] Uh, I remember
there being two babies.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.825
No, no, no!
This time, it's appreciably different.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.244
It's super-predator mating season.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.747
The time for love, romance,

04:06.830 --> 04:09.958
and smashing everything in its path
till it finds a mate.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.293
[gasping]

04:11.376 --> 04:15.172
When you say everything,
does that include egg-like objects?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.548
There's no way to stop it?

04:16.630 --> 04:19.509
Not unless you know any monsters
looking for love.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.346
My Aunt Gloggle is a monster,
but she's a heartbreaker.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.349
[Baitsy] Ow! My heart.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.267
Listen up!

04:27.350 --> 04:28.619
Get the whole valley and follow me

04:28.643 --> 04:30.687
to the abandoned molar bear hole
to wait this out.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.898
[cheering]

04:35.150 --> 04:36.276
Hold the bone!

04:36.359 --> 04:39.279
Don't just mindlessly follow Grug.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.948
Mindlessly follow me. I say we...

04:42.032 --> 04:43.950

I can't get stomped yet.
I haven't even had my first kiss.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.548
No? They're wonderful.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.551

Are you okay?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.360
Never been better.

05:26.868 --> 05:27.868
Hey, guys.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.164
What, is there something going on here
that I'm oblivious to?

05:31.248 --> 05:32.249
[chuckling]

05:32.332 --> 05:35.794
Nope. See you, you know, if we live.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.504
[groaning]

05:37.587 --> 05:39.839
So back to panicked fleeing?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.304
Ah, come on, come on!

05:46.388 --> 05:48.848
What are you doing? The egg's right there.

05:48.932 --> 05:52.477
Everyone,
follow my amazing voice into this hole.

05:52.561 --> 05:57.190
No, follow my amazing voice
into this hole.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.779

06:03.905 --> 06:05.657
[grunting]
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

06:06.908 --> 06:10.745
Now that is what it is like
to be evacuated by the best.

06:10.829 --> 06:15.667
I saved you and you and you and...

06:15.750 --> 06:19.379
Hey, who's "Oh," and where's Bulk?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.256
Snoot, did you forget Bulk?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.675
Of course not.
I never even thought of him.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.885
Snoot, Bulk is our second favorite son,

06:25.969 --> 06:28.638
but I see you did run home
to save that fern you like.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.849
I find it soothing.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.935
- Well, someone's gotta rescue him. Grug?
- Grug?

06:34.269 --> 06:36.938
Okay,
I gotta go be a hero for Snoot's family,

06:37.022 --> 06:39.816
because Snoot valued a plant
over his son's life.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.444
Don't get in any more crises
till I get back.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.989
No! I'm gonna go be a hero
for Snoot's family.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.741
But that would be brave.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.410

when your hair gets in your face.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.703
No, I don't...

06:51.786 --> 06:54.664
I can't see. The world has ended.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.666
Pretend that didn't happen.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.792
[sighing]

06:57.876 --> 07:01.546
Look, just because Grug's leader
doesn't mean he's the caveman for the job.

07:01.630 --> 07:05.550
I'm the boy's father,
so I'll be the one to save the day.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.721
This is crazy. You'll be stomped for sure.
Repeatedly, I bet.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.390
I'm not as useless as you think.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.385
Mm-hmm.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.929
Why is he acting like this?

07:51.012 --> 07:53.974
It's as if our almost kiss
didn't almost happen.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.517
[Thunk slurping]

07:55.642 --> 07:58.561
What? Why are you interested in him?
Isn't he, like, a jerk?

07:58.645 --> 07:59.813
No, not anymore.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.565
His old girlfriend Mel broke his heart

08:02.649 --> 08:04.609
when she fell in the tar pit
and disappeared.

08:04.693 --> 08:08.363
He's changed. He even grew a moustache.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.991
- [Thunk] That's a worm.
- [Eep] Still.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.784
[sighing]

08:12.867 --> 08:15.537
Did I do something wrong?
Should I get a worm-stache?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.456
No, it's just that,
in life or death moments,

08:18.540 --> 08:21.751
people act differently
because their instincts take over.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.379
Trust me, I almost die constantly.

See? Man, I have weird instincts.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.056
Huh. Life or death moments, you say.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.975
[Big Chickuna shrieking]

08:39.059 --> 08:42.856
If you insist on coming along,
you have to keep your mouth shut.

08:43.773 --> 08:48.028
No, if you insist on coming along,
you've gotta keep your mouth shut.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.655
- I'm gonna be the one to find him.
- Found him.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.703
Okay, so you sniffed him out,
but any dumb beast could do that.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.663
See? Told you.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.928
Preferably Grug, the leader of the valley.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.096
[sighing]

09:15.597 --> 09:19.350
Well, that's my cue.
Snoot, watch my rear. Snoot?

09:19.434 --> 09:22.437
Huh, not gonna look a gift lion horse
in the mouth.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.355
Here comes greatness!

09:24.439 --> 09:26.649
Please, no!

I act like I hate life, but I love it.
Even the little things.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.991
Dew on a blade of grass. A child's laugh.

Or cowering in a crevasse
while I shout, "I want to live!"

09:40.622 --> 09:42.624
Bulk, I'm here to rescue you.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.376
- Yeah, whatever.

Snoot, what are you doing
with that Tyrannaconda?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.596
Saving the day!

09:56.679 --> 10:00.683
I found another super-predator
to take out that super-predator.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.143
Jealous?

10:02.227 --> 10:05.146
What? That plan is crazy.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.398
- [shrieking]
- [hissing]

10:11.528 --> 10:12.821
Crazy working.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.163
Wow, Dad, you actually saved me.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.917
I wasn't prepared for this.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.546
None of us were, son,
but, yes, I saved you.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.965
Me. This was my idea.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.718
I deserve all the credit for it,
and Grug had nothing to do with it.

- Son!
