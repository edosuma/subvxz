00:00.083 --> 00:01.960
Previously on <i>Smash...</i>

00:03.485 --> 00:05.423
What's this <i>Marilyn</i> thing
I'll keep hearing about?

00:05.988 --> 00:08.092
- Ivy Lynn, Karen Cartwright.
- Classic.

00:08.093 --> 00:09.468
You put in ten years
in the chorus

00:09.469 --> 00:11.892
and Karen-something shows up.

00:11.893 --> 00:14.060
Michael Swift is available
if you're interested

00:14.061 --> 00:16.308
in making him
an offer for DiMaggio.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.665
I had an affair
with Michael Swift.

00:18.666 --> 00:21.334
- It's not going to be cheap.
- What's Jerry's involvement?

00:21.335 --> 00:22.703
Jerry has no involvement.

00:25.006 --> 00:26.652
That was incredible.

00:26.653 --> 00:27.987
Do you think he gave me the part
because I slept with him?

00:27.988 --> 00:29.697
He is a terrible human being!

00:33.747 --> 00:35.981
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:41.555 --> 00:43.321
First day.
I love first days.

00:43.322 --> 00:44.689
Me too.

00:44.690 --> 00:46.224
I am so glad
that you're doing this.

00:46.225 --> 00:49.193
- Me too.
- Exciting, isn't it?

00:49.194 --> 00:50.829
Hi, Linda.
Where am I?

00:50.830 --> 00:52.330
You and Tom are here,
Derek's there.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.566
Good, you put him
at a different table.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.401
Yeah, I've worked
with him before.

00:56.402 --> 01:00.538
Can you put Tom's assistant
at a different table too?

01:00.539 --> 01:03.674
She's the one who almost
took it out from under our Ivy?

01:03.675 --> 01:07.177
Where's the Marilyn in that?
Could she be more midwest?

01:07.178 --> 01:08.579
Actually no, she was
the golden sprout champion

01:08.580 --> 01:09.914
at the Iowa state fair.

01:09.915 --> 01:11.849
- You made that up.
- I didn't.

01:11.850 --> 01:13.684
- She put it on her resume.
- She's coming, she's coming.

01:13.685 --> 01:15.351
Hi, Dennis.
Karen.

01:15.352 --> 01:17.386
- Yeah, I remember.
- Hi.

01:17.387 --> 01:18.688
Hi.

01:18.689 --> 01:19.889
So do I put
my stuff down here?

01:19.890 --> 01:22.358
You can put it
anywhere you want.

01:22.359 --> 01:26.962
The maestro arrives.

01:26.963 --> 01:32.468
- Hi, Derek.
- Yeah, hi.

01:32.469 --> 01:33.802
Hey.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.305
Michael, hi.
Hi.

01:36.306 --> 01:38.574
Yeah, hi.

01:38.575 --> 01:40.776
- Great to be here.
- Well, we're thrilled.

01:40.777 --> 01:44.079
As you know.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.447
It's gonna be fine.

01:45.448 --> 01:46.440
You don't have
to be nervous, okay?

01:46.441 --> 01:48.916
I'm not.

01:48.917 --> 01:51.385
I mean, we're
both adults right?

01:51.386 --> 01:53.739
I was talking
about the workshop.

01:53.740 --> 01:56.924
- Michael, hi.
- Hey, Tom.

01:56.925 --> 02:00.394
You sound great on the demo
of <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith.</i>

02:00.395 --> 02:03.296
Yeah, it's great.
He's gonna be so great.

02:03.297 --> 02:06.633
So great.

02:06.634 --> 02:08.067
Thanks.

02:08.068 --> 02:13.807
I think I'm gonna warm up.
Excuse me.

02:13.808 --> 02:15.141
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

02:15.142 --> 02:16.175
- You just seem a little...
- Drop it.

02:16.176 --> 02:17.276
- You know.
- Drop it.

02:17.277 --> 02:18.677
- I just mean...
- Drop it.

02:18.678 --> 02:20.432
- Where's Eileen?
- I have no idea.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.447
- Well, where's the money?
- It's not there.

02:22.448 --> 02:23.644
Well, where'd it go?

02:23.645 --> 02:24.979
We are trying
to figure that out.

02:24.980 --> 02:26.418
You are my lawyer.

02:26.419 --> 02:27.982
It's gotta be somewhere.

02:27.983 --> 02:30.523
Jerry is swanning around town
spending as much money

02:30.524 --> 02:31.924
as he ever did!

02:31.925 --> 02:33.826
Well, his family
owns half of Manhattan.

02:33.827 --> 02:36.156
I know about his family
and their stupid money.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.741
Don't talk
to me about that.

02:37.742 --> 02:41.120
All I need is $200,000,
that's it... $200,000.

02:41.121 --> 02:42.454
Well, you have
access to $8,000.

02:42.455 --> 02:43.668
The rest of it is frozen.

02:43.669 --> 02:46.004
Your husband is...

02:46.005 --> 02:47.126
Very clever.

02:47.127 --> 02:49.140
I know
he's very clever.

02:49.141 --> 02:51.341
I know he's clever.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074

03:00.451 --> 03:02.683
Okay, everyone, here we go.

03:02.684 --> 03:05.221
Welcome to <i>Marilyn.</i>

03:21.038 --> 03:24.138
- Yeah!
- Bravo!

03:24.139 --> 03:26.708
Okay, settle down, please.
Settle down!

03:26.709 --> 03:28.910
Thank you.

03:28.911 --> 03:31.145
Okay, obviously we're
not gonna have a table read

03:31.146 --> 03:34.089
because the book
is still somewhat in flux.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.484
This'll be primarily
for the ensemble.

03:36.485 --> 03:39.553
We'll put the rest in when
the book is in better shape.

03:39.554 --> 03:40.754
We'll be staging
some of the numbers.

03:40.755 --> 03:42.097
Others will be
at music stands.

03:42.098 --> 03:43.591
We'll have some
costume elements,

03:43.592 --> 03:46.026
a few props
but basically...

03:46.027 --> 03:49.229
It's up to you
to sell it.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.932
Now remember...

03:51.933 --> 03:54.934
This is a workshop.

03:54.935 --> 03:59.405
The road to Broadway
is exceedingly long.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.941
So...

04:01.942 --> 04:04.443
Let's get to it.

04:04.444 --> 04:07.013
- Tom.
- How about a little mambo?

04:09.042 --> 04:10.876
- Why not?
- Grab a chair, grab a stand.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.005
Blondie.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.957
Trying to go to Broadway
without me,

04:18.958 --> 04:20.302
My God.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.888
Good to see you!
When did you get back?

04:22.889 --> 04:24.640
- Last week.
- Everything okay, children?

04:24.641 --> 04:27.564
- You hired Sam.
- I did.

04:27.565 --> 04:29.366
We did <i>Chicago</i> together.
Six years ago?

04:29.367 --> 04:30.968
- Ten.
- No, come on.

04:30.969 --> 04:33.524
Ten years ago, baby.
We were both in the chorus.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.901
And you are Marilyn Monroe...

04:35.902 --> 04:37.942
Yeah, actually
nobody is anybody

04:37.943 --> 04:39.576
until we start rehearsing,
okay?

04:39.577 --> 04:44.047
Got it, got it.

04:44.048 --> 04:45.115
Welcome.

04:58.995 --> 04:59.925
almost.

05:01.430 --> 05:05.013
Thanks, everybody.
That's a ten.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.852
You have
a really fantastic voice.

05:09.853 --> 05:13.272
- Did you hear her?
- Yeah, she sounds great.

05:13.273 --> 05:15.910
I knew the song from before,
it was my callback piece.

05:15.911 --> 05:17.776
Your callback for what?

05:17.777 --> 05:20.982
- For Marilyn.
- Well, I'm singing it now.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.988
How come nobody told me
she was going to be here?

05:26.989 --> 05:30.357
- Derek didn't tell you?
- No.

05:33.438 --> 05:35.627
I'm so sorry
you missed it.

05:35.628 --> 05:39.788
- Ivy is sublime.
- How's the rest of the cast?

05:39.789 --> 05:42.134
Michael Swift
is gonna be amazing.

05:42.135 --> 05:44.625
I know I had
my reservations

05:44.626 --> 05:46.054
but I could not
have been more wrong.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.961
The ensemble's terrific.

05:47.962 --> 05:50.063
Even Tom had nothing
to complain about.

05:51.478 --> 05:54.802
Good.

05:54.803 --> 05:58.906
- Here's to Marilyn.
- She was an interesting woman.

05:58.907 --> 06:01.208
She certainly was.

06:01.209 --> 06:02.821
God, what a life.

06:02.822 --> 06:05.032
Marilyn had money problems.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.712
Yeah, well the studios
never did pay her

06:06.713 --> 06:08.660
what she was worth.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.550
Of course they didn't.

06:11.551 --> 06:14.586
God.

06:14.587 --> 06:16.655
Drinking at the office.

06:16.656 --> 06:18.724
I love this.

06:18.725 --> 06:21.006
Julia, you told me once
that you were

06:21.007 --> 06:22.716
an art history major.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.676
Yeah.

06:24.677 --> 06:28.800
If that were a real Degas,
what would you pay for it?

06:28.801 --> 06:30.435
That?

06:38.409 --> 06:40.911
- It is a real Degas.
- Yeah.

06:43.915 --> 06:45.948
<i>Here's a lesson
they should teach in school</i>

06:45.949 --> 06:48.742
<i>when a girl gets curvy
and the boys all drool</i>

06:48.743 --> 06:51.203
<i>if math and science
just ain't you style</i>

06:51.204 --> 06:53.956
<i>just give that teacher
a wink and a smile</i>

06:53.957 --> 06:56.500
<i>for a passing grade
you won't have to wait</i>

06:56.501 --> 06:59.294
<i>and you can thank him
later when you graduate</i>

06:59.295 --> 07:03.299
<i>'cause I never met a wolf
who didn't love to howl</i>

07:05.169 --> 07:08.036
<i>no, I never met a man
who wasn't on the prowl</i>

07:08.037 --> 07:10.038
<i>shimmy, shimmy,
aah, gimme, gimme</i>

07:10.039 --> 07:11.014
<i>if a nice diploma
you wanna get</i>

07:11.015 --> 07:12.941
Take it down, Karen!

07:12.942 --> 07:15.352
<i>well then make that teacher
the student's pet</i>

07:15.353 --> 07:20.215
<i>yeah, I never met a wolf
who didn't love to howl</i>

07:20.216 --> 07:21.650
I'm sorry,
can we just stop?

07:21.651 --> 07:23.944
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.988
I'm just having
a little trouble hearing myself.

07:25.989 --> 07:27.721
The chorus is very...

07:27.722 --> 07:29.056
Enthusiastic.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.657
Ensemble.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.294
Well, not everyone
seems to understand that

07:33.295 --> 07:35.229
that means "as one."

07:37.917 --> 07:39.966
Okay, can
we take our ten now?

07:39.967 --> 07:43.669
Actually, it's lunch.

07:43.670 --> 07:46.300
Sorry.

07:56.649 --> 07:58.649
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:02.722 --> 08:04.189
Everything okay?

08:04.190 --> 08:05.319
Absolutely.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.156
Good.
Do you know the actor Lyle West?

08:09.157 --> 08:11.450
That kid
from all the TV shows?

08:11.451 --> 08:13.097
Yeah.

08:13.098 --> 08:15.203
I gave him his first job
when he was eight years old.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.955
I made him a star.

08:16.956 --> 08:21.339
Aw, you're so sentimental.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.941
Yeah, well I'm sentimental
enough to throw him

08:22.942 --> 08:25.797
a birthday party
on Saturday night.

08:25.798 --> 08:29.079
Do you want to come?

08:29.080 --> 08:30.747
Well, sure.

08:30.748 --> 08:35.284
I... I'd love to.

08:35.285 --> 08:38.121
Good.

08:38.121 --> 08:40.289
Ivy's doing the nasty
with the dark lord,

08:40.291 --> 08:41.980
That's what I said.

08:44.859 --> 08:46.728
Who's the dark lord?

08:46.729 --> 08:49.947
Sauron himself.
Darth Derek.

08:49.948 --> 08:51.990
Look, I better run.
I've got a lunch meeting.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.470
I'm having lunch
with Tom.

08:54.471 --> 08:57.373
Well, ask him
how the new song is coming.

08:57.374 --> 09:00.999
She's sleeping with him?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.710
I don't think they're
getting all that much sleep.

09:04.313 --> 09:05.913
- Just saying'.
- Stop talking about my friend.

09:05.914 --> 09:07.748
Calm down.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.150
Why is he sending
messages through you?

09:09.151 --> 09:10.285
If he wants to know
about the new number

09:10.286 --> 09:11.486
he can just ask me.

09:11.487 --> 09:13.154
I'm sure he will.

09:13.155 --> 09:14.596
I know he's not
your favorite person.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.223
What are you
talking about?

09:16.224 --> 09:18.225
I love him.
What a stellar human being.

09:18.226 --> 09:21.128
A role model for us all.

09:21.129 --> 09:22.980
He better treat you right,
that's all I have to say.

09:22.981 --> 09:27.442
I'm a big girl, Tom.
I can take care of myself.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.403
Listen, I have a question.

09:29.404 --> 09:30.946
And I hope
this is okay.

09:30.947 --> 09:33.073
You're my star,
anything's okay.

09:33.074 --> 09:34.907
How come nobody told me
that Karen Cartwright

09:34.908 --> 09:36.952
was gonna be
in the ensemble?

09:38.945 --> 09:41.514
Actually it was Julia's idea.

09:41.515 --> 09:42.791
She wanted
to give her something.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.783
She did work really hard
on those auditions

09:44.784 --> 09:47.713
and she is impressive.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.687
She completely is.

09:49.688 --> 09:52.257
It just would have helped
to have a heads up.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.826
Absolutely.
My fault.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.346
So could you listen
to the wolf number

09:56.347 --> 09:59.297
when we get back to it
after lunch?

09:59.298 --> 10:00.665
She's just...
She's right next to me

10:00.666 --> 10:04.168
and she's just
a little bit loud.

10:06.804 --> 10:09.317
So did you hear
that Lyle West is in town?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.375
Lyle's in town.

10:11.376 --> 10:14.845
God, I haven't
seen him in... forever.

10:14.846 --> 10:16.180
Throwing
a big birthday party

10:16.181 --> 10:17.448
for him this weekend.

10:17.449 --> 10:20.620
He discovered him, you know.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.685
- He did not say that.
- He did.

10:22.686 --> 10:24.987
He told Ivy
he "discovered" Lyle.

10:24.988 --> 10:27.457
What,
did he plant a flag in the kid?

10:27.458 --> 10:29.692
I think it's so silly
when people take credit

10:29.693 --> 10:31.048
for other people's careers.

10:31.395 --> 10:34.176
Heh.
That was my show he directed.

10:34.177 --> 10:36.303
And the fact is Derek
didn't discover that kid.

10:36.304 --> 10:38.333
I discovered that kid.
He didn't even want to cast him.

10:38.334 --> 10:42.971
I was the one who said
"we have to cast that kid."

10:42.972 --> 10:44.873
How's the new number coming?

10:44.874 --> 10:48.477
You'll get it
when you get it.

10:48.478 --> 10:50.245
What's she upset
about this time?

10:50.246 --> 10:52.880
Nope, no one's upset.

10:52.881 --> 10:54.549
So I hear Lyle west
is in town.

10:54.550 --> 10:57.151
You having a birthday party
for him?

10:57.152 --> 10:59.353
Both true things.

10:59.354 --> 11:03.591
Do you think maybe
you could invite Tom?

11:03.592 --> 11:05.560
Tom!
Lyle West is in town.

11:05.561 --> 11:07.095
I'm having a party
on Saturday night.

11:07.096 --> 11:09.362
You like to come?

11:09.363 --> 11:11.046
I think I have plans.

11:11.047 --> 11:13.866
Well, I'm sure
he'd love to see you.

11:13.867 --> 11:16.551
As would I.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.271
You're welcome
of course too, darling.

11:18.272 --> 11:19.971
And when am I gonna get
to see my new scenes?

11:19.972 --> 11:21.973
I'm on my way home
right now to write them.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.142
Good.

11:24.143 --> 11:27.779
Derek's having
a big party,

11:42.694 --> 11:44.795
I need some bubble wrap.

11:44.796 --> 11:46.631
- Bubble wrap?
- You've heard of it.

11:46.632 --> 11:50.735
Bubble wrap.

12:11.322 --> 12:13.822
Okay, hold on, hold on.

12:13.823 --> 12:16.759
Okay, new idea.
Karen, step back next to Bobby.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.698
What's wrong?

12:19.699 --> 12:22.298
Let's take it
from the dance break.

12:22.299 --> 12:23.827
Again!
Five, six, seven and...

12:29.238 --> 12:30.838
Sorry...

12:35.110 --> 12:36.047
You okay?

12:36.048 --> 12:38.049
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...

12:45.353 --> 12:46.420
Hey, when you do this
in the theater,

12:46.421 --> 12:47.988
are the numbers still there?

12:47.989 --> 12:49.523
Yes, Iowa, the numbers
are still there in the theater.

12:49.524 --> 12:50.591
Okay, I've just
never done this...

12:50.592 --> 12:53.148
We know.

12:53.149 --> 12:55.462
Bobby, Karen?

12:55.463 --> 12:57.164
Come on.

12:57.165 --> 12:58.532
I don't...
What does he mean?

12:58.533 --> 12:59.905
It means we're out
of the number.

12:59.906 --> 13:01.801
Remind me not to stand
next to you anymore.

13:01.802 --> 13:04.036
- What?
- Again!

13:04.037 --> 13:05.202
Five, six, seven, and...

13:10.447 --> 13:12.533
So first she has me
put in the back row.

13:12.534 --> 13:15.245
Then I'm out
of the number altogether.

13:15.246 --> 13:17.747
Dev here.
Yeah, it went great.

13:17.748 --> 13:20.217
A corrections officer got
arrested for a DWI in the Bronx.

13:20.218 --> 13:22.652
The police desk
never even called.

13:22.653 --> 13:24.954
Great, thanks.

13:24.955 --> 13:27.140
Sorry... Ivy has
that kind of power?

13:27.141 --> 13:28.291
She's the star,
plus she's sleeping

13:28.292 --> 13:29.758
with the director.

13:29.759 --> 13:31.093
That apparently comes
with all sorts of perks.

13:31.094 --> 13:32.261
She's sleeping
with the director, wow.

13:32.262 --> 13:33.772
You buried the lead.

13:33.773 --> 13:35.398
It's just depressing
that she's allowed

13:35.399 --> 13:36.899
to do
whatever she wants to me.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.401
Maybe you should
just keep your head down.

13:38.402 --> 13:39.902
I'm an actress.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.236
I'm not supposed
to keep my head down,

13:41.237 --> 13:42.447
I'm supposed
to play to the balcony.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.617
Sorry.
Dev here.

13:45.618 --> 13:47.410
No, no, no, no, Andrew.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.144
I've been on call now
for six days.

13:49.145 --> 13:50.611
- I need a night's sleep.
- I'm going to the gym.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.123
- Hang on.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.625
Just... just breathe.

13:53.626 --> 13:56.918
I can't.
Ivy might hear me.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.618
Love you.

13:58.619 --> 14:00.131
No, not you, Andrew.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.624
I thought it was nice
that he invited you.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.460
He invited me
because you told him to.

14:06.461 --> 14:08.028
Tom.

14:08.029 --> 14:10.097
You love that kid.

14:10.098 --> 14:11.465
I've heard you say
so many times

14:11.466 --> 14:13.799
how proud
you are of Lyle.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.835
How impressive he was
as a little boy.

14:15.836 --> 14:17.603
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

14:17.604 --> 14:19.939
- Six years.
- Go to the party!

14:19.940 --> 14:20.986
Tom!

14:20.987 --> 14:23.609
- I can't.
- Why?

14:23.610 --> 14:26.879
- I have a date.
- You have a date?

14:26.880 --> 14:28.281
Yes, I have a date.
Saturday night I have a date.

14:28.282 --> 14:30.015
- You do not.
- I do.

14:30.016 --> 14:32.150
With whom?

14:32.151 --> 14:34.319
Someone my mother knows.

14:34.320 --> 14:39.024
He's taking me
to a steak house.

14:39.025 --> 14:41.226
Your mother...

14:41.227 --> 14:42.527
Set you up?

14:42.528 --> 14:45.696
On a date?

14:45.697 --> 14:47.031
No, that sounds like fun.

14:47.032 --> 14:49.533
That sounds like
a really good idea.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.302
You should do that.

14:51.303 --> 14:53.337
You should do that
instead of going

14:53.338 --> 14:56.146
to a really cool party
honoring the kid

14:56.147 --> 14:57.875
<i>you</i> discovered.

14:57.876 --> 15:01.244
Who you've always liked,
who is now a big TV star.

15:01.245 --> 15:02.444
No, seriously.
A steak house?

15:02.445 --> 15:04.347
That sounds like
much more fun.

15:08.752 --> 15:11.754
Tom?

15:16.894 --> 15:18.860
According to your records,
it was purchased from a dealer

15:18.861 --> 15:23.214
in Paris in 1985,
Francois Melinot.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.666
That's right.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.217
I just spoke
to monsieur Melinot.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.553
The provenance seems
to be accurately recorded.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.839
And the sketch
is charming.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.207
Any number of my clients
would love this.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.410
Degas did many sketches
of the little dancers,

15:35.411 --> 15:39.713
but this one
has extraordinary grace notes.

15:39.714 --> 15:41.358
- How much?
- Heh.

15:41.359 --> 15:44.235
Auctions are
notoriously unreliable,

15:44.236 --> 15:48.889
but an authentic Degas sketch
of this quality, 350.

15:48.890 --> 15:52.225
400.

15:52.226 --> 15:55.028
What if I just wanted
to sell it?

15:56.697 --> 15:58.291
Before we talk details,
I'm a little concerned

15:58.292 --> 16:00.200
about the bill of sale.

16:00.201 --> 16:01.935
It was a gift
from my husband.

16:01.936 --> 16:03.403
A wedding gift
in fact.

16:03.404 --> 16:05.924
But the bill of sale
is in his name, you see.

16:05.925 --> 16:09.408
Unless you have
a letter of transfer?

16:09.409 --> 16:12.222
He didn't want it.
He doesn't even like it.

16:12.223 --> 16:16.082
Nevertheless, he owns it.

16:16.083 --> 16:19.229
Perhaps you could
have him call me

16:19.230 --> 16:22.287
and I could explain
the legalities.

16:30.662 --> 16:34.099
<i>'cause history
is made at night</i>

16:34.100 --> 16:37.747
<i>so close the books,
turn off the light</i>

16:37.748 --> 16:40.770
<i>and listen</i>

16:40.771 --> 16:44.212
<i>let my heart
be the teacher</i>

16:44.213 --> 16:46.643
Okay, hold on.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.216
Hold on.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.980
Just give us a second.

16:49.981 --> 16:52.637
Your boys are hogging
all the melody.

16:52.638 --> 16:54.117
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:55.852 --> 16:57.520
Heh.

16:57.521 --> 17:02.024
You know, um,
I should really get going.

17:02.025 --> 17:03.326
I still have
a lot of work to do.

17:03.327 --> 17:07.262
Stay.
I like an audience.

17:07.263 --> 17:09.988
Yeah, well an audience
likes a coherent book.

17:09.989 --> 17:12.991
So...

17:12.992 --> 17:15.503
You sound great.

17:15.505 --> 17:16.661
Okay.

17:16.662 --> 17:22.109
Let's take it again.

17:24.513 --> 17:28.015
<i>'cause history

17:28.016 --> 17:31.185
<i>so close the books,

17:43.965 --> 17:46.357
<i>you've been missing</i>

17:46.358 --> 17:47.567
Okay, guys.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.652
Give a girl a chance.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.529
Yeah, she's right.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.307
There's too much sound
in the mix, Tom.

17:54.308 --> 17:55.366
It's eight voices.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.343
They sound fantastic.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.663
It's just... at least
while I'm learning it.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.500
Sure, sure. Karen, why don't
you sit this one out?

18:03.501 --> 18:05.710
- I can tone it down.
- It's just for now.

18:05.711 --> 18:10.923
We just need to hear
the number without you.

18:10.924 --> 18:16.094
Excuse me.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.139
Let's take it again.

18:20.733 --> 18:24.187
<i>'cause history

18:39.017 --> 18:41.919
How's it going in there?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.722
How do you think
it's going?

18:44.723 --> 18:45.750
It's horrible.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.857
It's...

18:47.858 --> 18:49.125
It's horrible.

18:49.126 --> 18:50.922
And you guys
are just horrible too.

18:50.923 --> 18:53.758
Don't say "whoa," it's true.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.798
She's trying to get me fired
and you guys are, like,

18:55.799 --> 18:57.345
"she's a hick,
she's from Iowa."

18:57.346 --> 18:58.868
I am just as good
as any of you guys.

18:58.869 --> 19:02.404
- Shh! They can hear.
- It's true.

19:02.405 --> 19:05.274
I am the same as you.

19:05.275 --> 19:06.563
You were all beginners too.

19:06.564 --> 19:09.445
And I'm good.

19:09.446 --> 19:10.479
I could've done that.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.070
I could've slept with him.

19:14.071 --> 19:17.653
I could've, he...

19:17.654 --> 19:19.087
And I didn't.

19:19.088 --> 19:21.589
And I wouldn't.

19:21.590 --> 19:24.659
And that doesn't make me
stupid or lame

19:24.660 --> 19:27.792
or untalented.

19:27.793 --> 19:30.665
And she shouldn't
be trying to get me fired.

19:30.666 --> 19:33.047
And you should be trying
to help me.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.813
What are we doing?

19:45.814 --> 19:47.181
Jessica had
a mother Theresa,

19:47.182 --> 19:49.650
come-to-Jesus moment.

19:49.651 --> 19:52.150
- We're helping.
- $250?

19:52.151 --> 19:55.621
Flesh tone tights
with fishnet stockings on top

19:55.622 --> 19:56.821
to get some texture.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.990
You wear that
under some loose pants,

19:58.991 --> 20:00.617
some high-top sneakers,
and a sweater

20:00.618 --> 20:02.619
- cut off at the neckline.
- Okay.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.164
You come into rehearsal
with your hair down,

20:04.165 --> 20:05.865
go into the bathroom,
take off your sweats

20:05.866 --> 20:07.699
and your sweater,
put your hair up in a pony tail

20:07.700 --> 20:08.875
and come back in.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.836
So it's like high school,

20:10.837 --> 20:12.337
you try and look
like everyone else.

20:12.338 --> 20:13.939
Exactly.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.540
- Where do you take class?
- What kind of class?

20:15.541 --> 20:17.142
Dance class.

20:17.143 --> 20:19.178
We'll get you into ours,
it's good.

20:19.179 --> 20:21.387
But maybe tonight
we should do an intervention.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.807
Could we?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.784
Divorce is not
the most fun thing

20:26.785 --> 20:29.386
that's ever happened
to me in my life.

20:29.387 --> 20:31.105
I'm trying
to sell this sketch.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.390
Yes.

20:33.391 --> 20:34.725
Jerry's name
is on the bill of sale.

20:34.726 --> 20:36.361
It's a problem.

20:36.362 --> 20:41.665
- Yes.
- I hate Jerry.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.493
I used to love him.

20:43.494 --> 20:46.236
That sketch looks to me
like our happiness

20:46.237 --> 20:51.241
and I... I don't know
why it still looks that way.

20:51.242 --> 20:53.977
Let's get
you outta here.

20:53.978 --> 20:55.745
Lyle west is in town,
do you know him?

20:55.746 --> 20:58.815
We did <i>Oliver</i> together
when he was 11 years old.

20:58.816 --> 21:01.386
Well, Derek is throwing
him a birthday party.

21:01.387 --> 21:03.721
I don't think
I'm up to it.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.088
Just come
for a little while.

21:06.089 --> 21:07.093
Let me just call

21:07.094 --> 21:10.103
and make sure that Jerry's
not gonna be there.

21:10.104 --> 21:13.028
Lyle was such
a sweet little boy.

21:13.029 --> 21:14.816
"Please, sir, I want some more."

21:16.599 --> 21:19.067
Yeah, well that sweet boy
is now a mega-zillionaire.

21:19.068 --> 21:20.405
Yeah,
don't you know?

21:20.406 --> 21:22.337
His last show
was sold into syndication

21:22.338 --> 21:24.873
for $80 million.

21:24.874 --> 21:26.202
80 million?

21:26.203 --> 21:28.454
It was just in the trades,
just last week.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.179
Derek... oh, good.
I'm glad I caught you.

21:31.180 --> 21:34.181
80 million, mm.

21:35.588 --> 21:37.154
She's too big.

21:37.155 --> 21:39.266
I didn't work my ass off
for ten years

21:39.267 --> 21:41.168
just to be upstaged by somebody
who doesn't even know...

21:41.169 --> 21:42.568
I know, I get it,
I'm just... I'm saying

21:42.569 --> 21:44.403
you didn't have
to pull a diva on her.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.438
I didn't even
pull half a diva.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.974
And trust me,
they never would have cut her

21:47.975 --> 21:49.559
just to make me
feel better.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.178
Ivy, baby, it's not
like I know this chick.

21:52.179 --> 21:53.779
I'm not all worried
about her feelings,

21:53.780 --> 21:58.025
- it's just... oh, no, look at this.
- What?

21:58.026 --> 22:00.352
My Mets, they have,
like, no pitching this season.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.154
- None.
- Well, I'm not apologizing.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.656
Woman, for the last time
I'm not asking you

22:05.657 --> 22:08.244
to apologize,
I'm... oh, my God.

22:08.245 --> 22:09.794
Sam, the Mets
are gonna be fine.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.263
Not "oh, my God,
the poor Mets."

22:11.264 --> 22:12.864
My God,
you look amazing.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.164
- I do?
- You do.

22:14.165 --> 22:15.632
- Really?
- Really.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.369
It's a Zac Posen.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.337
I think it's only
been worn once.

22:20.338 --> 22:22.806
And the zipper
still works and everything.

22:22.807 --> 22:25.009
Me

22:28.713 --> 22:29.946
Hey, love,
you're home late.

22:29.947 --> 22:32.681
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:32.682 --> 22:33.950
- Hello.
- Hi.

22:33.951 --> 22:36.986
- Hi.
- Hi, Bobby.

22:36.987 --> 22:39.355
Dev, nice to meet you.

22:39.356 --> 22:41.324
What the...?

22:43.961 --> 22:45.156
Okay.

22:45.157 --> 22:47.296
Karen?

22:47.297 --> 22:48.563
Sorry about this.

22:48.564 --> 22:50.661
Everyone, this
is my boyfriend Dev.

22:50.662 --> 22:53.335
Well done, Iowa.

22:53.336 --> 22:55.082
You're
all here because...

22:55.083 --> 22:57.251
We're doing
an intervention.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.374
Things haven't improved,
I gather.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.576
I'm not gonna lie,
it's a disaster.

23:02.577 --> 23:04.717
This is cute.

23:06.548 --> 23:09.250
<i>I'm not surprised,
not everything lasts</i>

23:09.251 --> 23:11.585
<i>I've broken my heart
so many times</i>

23:11.586 --> 23:13.142
<i>I've stopped
keeping track</i>

23:13.143 --> 23:16.771
<i>I talk myself in,
I talk myself out</i>

23:16.772 --> 23:20.274
<i>I get all worked up
and then I let myself down</i>

23:20.275 --> 23:24.831
<i>I tried so very hard
not to lose it</i>

23:24.832 --> 23:28.568
<i>I came up
with a million excuses</i>

23:28.569 --> 23:34.440
<i>I thought I thought
of every possibility</i>

23:34.441 --> 23:38.243
<i>but somehow I know
that it'll all turn out</i>

23:38.244 --> 23:42.421
<i>and you'll make me work
so we can work to work it out</i>

23:42.422 --> 23:46.051
<i>and I promise you, kid,
that I'll give so much more</i>

23:46.052 --> 23:48.845
<i>than I get</i>

23:48.846 --> 23:51.764
<i>I just haven't
met you yet</i>

23:51.765 --> 23:56.127
<i>they say all's fair</i>

23:56.128 --> 23:59.197
<i>in love and war</i>

23:59.198 --> 24:02.000
<i>but I won't need
to fight it</i>

24:02.357 --> 24:04.102
<i>we'll get it right</i>

24:04.103 --> 24:07.237
<i>and we'll be united</i>

24:07.238 --> 24:10.907
<i>oh, you know
that it'll all tn n out</i>

24:10.908 --> 24:15.078
<i>and you'll make me work
so we can work to work it out</i>

24:15.079 --> 24:19.049
<i>hey, and I promise you, kid,
that I'll give so much more</i>

24:19.050 --> 24:21.751
<i>than I get</i>

24:21.752 --> 24:25.621
<i>I just haven't
met you yet</i>

24:25.622 --> 24:29.392
Thank you.

24:41.671 --> 24:45.273
- You look stunning.
- Your place is beautiful.

24:45.274 --> 24:49.344
Thanks.

24:49.345 --> 24:51.980
Lyle, this is Ivy.

24:51.981 --> 24:53.615
She's playing my Marilyn.

24:53.616 --> 24:56.746
I can immediately see
why they cast you as Marilyn.

24:57.185 --> 24:58.915
That dress is amazing.

24:58.916 --> 25:01.088
Lyle.

25:01.089 --> 25:03.669
This is very precocious
behavior for a 15-year-old.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.589
I'm 12, you jerk.

25:07.095 --> 25:09.592
And precocious would
be showing her the bedrooms.

25:09.593 --> 25:11.427
Would you like
to see the bedrooms?

25:11.428 --> 25:14.267
You're adorable.

25:14.268 --> 25:16.202
She thinks I'm kidding...

25:16.203 --> 25:18.142
I so wish
you didn't think that.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.436
You played beautifully.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.642
I finished
my mba at wharton,

25:22.643 --> 25:24.377
even though I knew
that ultimately the law

25:24.378 --> 25:27.780
was going to be
more compelling to me.

25:27.781 --> 25:29.448
Why?

25:29.449 --> 25:33.351
How did you know?

25:33.352 --> 25:36.121
"Applied principles
of macro-dynamics

25:36.122 --> 25:38.691
in developing economies."

25:38.692 --> 25:40.539
I was as bored
as you look right now.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.527
No.

25:42.528 --> 25:45.129
Don't be polite,
it's not necessary.

25:45.130 --> 25:47.364
I'm boring myself, frankly.

25:47.365 --> 25:49.256
I'm a little nervous.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.302
You don't look nervous.

25:51.303 --> 25:53.738
Seriously, I had no intention
of going out on a date

25:53.739 --> 25:55.388
that my mother
set up for me

25:55.389 --> 26:00.559
but then I checked you out
online and I thought... wow.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.513
Yay, mom.

26:07.318 --> 26:09.152
Hi, we're friends
of Derek's.

26:09.153 --> 26:11.054
I know who you are,
Mrs. Rand.

26:11.055 --> 26:13.223
I have something here, I'd
like to put it somewhere safe.

26:13.224 --> 26:14.657
Sure, right this way.

26:15.092 --> 26:16.926
I'll see you inside.

26:16.927 --> 26:20.062
You know, Mrs. Rand,
I'm an actress and a dancer.

26:20.063 --> 26:24.433
Not now, sweetheart.

26:24.434 --> 26:25.868
Ellis?

26:25.869 --> 26:27.903
Julia, hi!

26:27.904 --> 26:29.404
This
is my friend Cynthia.

26:29.405 --> 26:30.840
Cyn.
People call me "Cyn."

26:32.074 --> 26:33.842
Julia is Tom's
writing partner.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.303
Of course.
I know who you are.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.013
Well, he talks about
you guys all the time.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.615
He's, like, obsessed.

26:39.616 --> 26:41.058
Not obsessed.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.917
Interested.

26:42.918 --> 26:45.287
I'm surprised
to see you here, Ellis.

26:45.288 --> 26:46.439
Is Tom here?

26:46.440 --> 26:48.589
I haven't seen him.

26:48.590 --> 26:51.592
Excuse me.

26:56.731 --> 26:57.931
Lyle?

26:57.932 --> 26:59.767
- Eileen.
- Hi.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.236
Are you hiding here
all alone on the stairs?

27:02.237 --> 27:04.037
I am.

27:04.038 --> 27:05.605
It's so great that Derek
did this for me but sometimes

27:05.606 --> 27:08.085
parties like this,
I feel like I have to be "on."

27:08.086 --> 27:09.576
Well, you're
a big star now.

27:09.577 --> 27:10.546
You'd think you'd
get used to it.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.045
You'd be wrong.

27:12.046 --> 27:15.215
I was really hoping
to just see my friends.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.916
Well, I think you'll find
you have a lot of those

27:16.917 --> 27:19.719
now that your show's
gone into syndication.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.554
You got that right.

27:21.555 --> 27:22.975
I was reading the trades
and I thought,

27:22.976 --> 27:26.257
"mm, my goodness,
what is Lyle gonna do

27:26.258 --> 27:27.438
with all that cash?"

27:27.439 --> 27:29.161
Well, I'm
all over the map.

27:29.162 --> 27:30.929
My business manager
has me in Sri Lanka's

27:30.930 --> 27:33.986
Colombo stock exchange,
the classic car market.

27:33.987 --> 27:36.530
Drinks!

27:36.531 --> 27:38.303
Now what exactly
is the problem?

27:38.304 --> 27:40.105
I think she's
a wonderful dancer.

27:40.106 --> 27:41.535
Her dancing isn't the problem,
it's actually fierce.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.273
It's not, like,
all trained and perfect.

27:43.274 --> 27:44.747
- But it's watchable.
- Watchable?

27:44.748 --> 27:46.540
I'm watching her
and I usually

27:46.541 --> 27:48.250
like to watch myself
in the mirror.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.044
That's true.

27:50.045 --> 27:53.084
- Ivy's the problem.
- Ivy's fine.

27:53.085 --> 27:55.174
The problem is you,
miss artichoke heart.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.254
Golden sprout champion,
and it was a great day for me

27:57.255 --> 27:59.155
so don't
make fun of it.

27:59.156 --> 28:00.623
Yeah, but you didn't sign up
to be champion this time.

28:00.624 --> 28:02.025
That's Ivy's job.

28:02.026 --> 28:03.641
You signed up
to be her backup singer.

28:03.642 --> 28:05.142
- I'm trying.
- My God.

28:05.143 --> 28:07.296
You are so not trying.

28:07.297 --> 28:08.687
Ladies...

28:08.688 --> 28:10.189
Should we show her
how it's done?

28:10.190 --> 28:12.802
Move this table.
Please, help me.

28:12.803 --> 28:15.204
- I'm getting a show?
- You're getting a lesson.

28:16.272 --> 28:18.040
- This way?
- Yup.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.698
We told you that
we're in the same dance class.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.200
Now watch and learn.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.576
What are we doing?

28:22.577 --> 28:24.947
- <i>Rumour has it.</i>
- Perfect.

28:24.948 --> 28:26.148
Lucky you.

28:27.884 --> 28:29.684
Don't lose focus,
eyes out.

28:30.786 --> 28:32.653
Nobody's bigger than anybody.

28:32.654 --> 28:34.655
Nobody's out of line.

28:34.656 --> 28:35.790
Everybody's in it.

28:38.127 --> 28:39.961
Five, six, seven, eight.

28:39.962 --> 28:41.857
<i>She, she ain't real</i>

28:41.858 --> 28:46.225
<i>she ain't gonna be able
to love you like I will</i>

28:46.226 --> 28:48.368
Stop.

28:48.369 --> 28:49.535
Okay.

28:49.536 --> 28:52.205
<i>She is a stranger</i>

28:52.206 --> 28:56.143
<i>you and I have history
or don't you remember?</i>

28:56.144 --> 29:00.013
<i>sure, she's
got it all</i>

29:00.014 --> 29:03.516
<i>but, baby, is that
really what you want</i>

29:06.219 --> 29:08.414
I'm surprised no one's
mentioned art to you.

29:08.415 --> 29:12.224
It's the one investment
that never loses its value.

29:12.225 --> 29:15.395
Art and gold bullion.

29:15.396 --> 29:17.256
You know why?

29:17.257 --> 29:21.385
- The Chinese.
- The Chinese like Degas?

29:21.386 --> 29:24.002
No, the Chinese
like a good investment.

29:24.003 --> 29:27.266
Currencies are failing,
the stock market is a mess.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.441
Art and gold bullion.

29:29.442 --> 29:32.711
Those are your choices.

29:32.712 --> 29:34.273
How much do you need?

29:34.274 --> 29:37.276
- 200,000.
- 200,000... that's all?

29:37.277 --> 29:39.450
Well, for those of us
who aren't in syndication,

29:39.451 --> 29:44.755
that's rather a lot.

29:44.756 --> 29:46.190
I tell you what.

29:46.191 --> 29:48.329
I'll give you 175
for the drawing.

29:48.330 --> 29:49.955
Keep it as collateral
and you give me points.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.093
Why would
I give you the sketch

29:51.094 --> 29:52.625
if I'm giving you points?

29:52.626 --> 29:54.793
If <i>Marilyn</i> flops
I still come out even.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.734
And if it's a success,
then you get your sketch back.

29:57.735 --> 29:59.840
Which you wouldn't
if you just sold it to me.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.405
Little Lyle,
all grown up.

30:02.406 --> 30:04.511
- One point.
- Three.

30:04.512 --> 30:08.910
1 1/2,
and I get the money this week.

30:08.911 --> 30:10.879
How do I know
if the show's any good?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.645
I mean, it's
all in the execution.

30:12.646 --> 30:15.314
That's a fair question.

30:15.315 --> 30:18.620
Scotch?...

30:18.621 --> 30:20.489
- Find Tom.
- There you are.

30:20.490 --> 30:21.724
Yeah, and
do me a favor.

30:21.725 --> 30:23.358
Get our DiMaggio
on the phone too.

30:25.093 --> 30:26.992
You want me
to call Michael?

30:26.993 --> 30:28.629
Why?

30:28.630 --> 30:30.732
He... he's probably
at home with his family.

30:30.733 --> 30:33.234
I don't want to...

30:33.235 --> 30:35.503
Hold this...

30:35.504 --> 30:37.905
Damn.

30:41.609 --> 30:45.427
And one, two, three, four.
And five, six, seven, eight.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.847
And one, two... okay.

30:46.848 --> 30:48.782
Too much.
Let me do it next to you.

30:48.783 --> 30:50.283
Five, six, seven, eight.

30:50.284 --> 30:53.519
- And one, two...
- No, no, stop pulling focus.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.455
From the arms... seven, eight.
One, two...

30:56.456 --> 30:57.623
You guys are worse
than the New York press.

30:57.624 --> 30:59.692
One, two, three, four.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.694
And one, two, three, four.

31:05.665 --> 31:08.934
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.202
This better be good.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.703
I don't actually
know what it is.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.104
- Hi
- hi.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.606
- John.
- What's going on?

31:14.607 --> 31:16.750
- I... I don't know.
- God, look at you.

31:16.751 --> 31:18.002
You need me?

31:18.003 --> 31:19.628
A-ha!

31:19.629 --> 31:22.113
The reinforcements
have arrived.

31:22.114 --> 31:26.117
I knew they would.
It's showtime.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.055
Today... is my birthday.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.934
I'm so glad
you're all here with me.

31:32.935 --> 31:35.903
Thank you.

31:35.904 --> 31:39.039
Derek Wills and Tom Levitt
cast me my first musical

31:39.040 --> 31:41.675
off-Broadway when
I was just eight years old.

31:41.676 --> 31:44.578
So they were best friends as
well as being the best friends

31:44.579 --> 31:46.580
an eight-year-old wannabe
musical theater star

31:46.581 --> 31:48.073
could hope for.

31:48.074 --> 31:52.185
And so I asked them, as a gift,
to play me a song

31:52.186 --> 31:54.913
from their new musical <i>Marilyn,</i>
and they said yes!

32:03.689 --> 32:06.758
Well, we've, uh,
just started learning

32:06.759 --> 32:09.678
the big USO number where Marilyn
sings to the troops.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.972
That sound like something
you might wanna hear?

32:11.973 --> 32:15.065
Yeah!

32:17.369 --> 32:19.470
It's in <i>G</i>,
very easy changes.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.038
Just... read my mind.

32:22.039 --> 32:24.574
Ladies and gentlemen.

32:24.575 --> 32:27.042
Marilyn herself.

32:27.043 --> 32:28.310
Ivy Lynn.

32:32.048 --> 32:35.885
<i>When you are born
with sex appeal</i>

32:35.886 --> 32:39.333
<i>in the forest
called Hollywood</i>

32:39.889 --> 32:43.725
<i>you'll find more wolves
at your back door</i>

32:43.726 --> 32:47.674
<i>than that
little red riding hood</i>

32:47.675 --> 32:51.600
<i>now she and
her little old grandma</i>

32:51.601 --> 32:55.808
<i>could have learned
from the men I've dated</i>

32:55.809 --> 32:57.171
<i>that a wolf</i>

32:57.172 --> 32:59.507
<i>can be quite</i>

32:59.508 --> 33:03.344
<i>a devotee</i>

33:03.345 --> 33:08.487
<i>once he's domesticated</i>

33:24.032 --> 33:25.832
<i>there's a lesson
they should teach in school</i>

33:26.254 --> 33:28.434
<i>when a girl gets curvy
and the boys all drool</i>

33:28.435 --> 33:30.926
<i>if math and science
just ain't your style</i>

33:30.927 --> 33:34.140
<i>just give that teacher a wink</i>

33:34.141 --> 33:36.442
<i>for a passing grade
you won't have to wait</i>

33:36.443 --> 33:39.278
<i>and you can thank him later
when you graduate</i>

33:39.279 --> 33:43.615
<i>'cause I never met a wolf
who didn't love to howl</i>

33:44.917 --> 33:46.351
<i>no, I never met a man</i>

33:46.352 --> 33:48.119
<i>who wasn't on the prowl</i>

33:48.742 --> 33:50.042
<i>shimmy, shimmy,
aw, gimme, gimme</i>

33:50.122 --> 33:52.357
<i>if a nice diploma
you want to get</i>

33:52.358 --> 33:55.126
<i>well then make that teacher
the student's pet</i>

33:55.127 --> 33:59.697
<i>yeah, I never met a wolf
who didn't love to howl</i>

34:01.366 --> 34:03.200
<i>you never know
where a wolf might crouch</i>

34:03.201 --> 34:05.937
<i>but his natural habitat's
the casting couch</i>

34:05.938 --> 34:08.706
<i>so take lots of pictures
of the wildlife</i>

34:08.706 --> 34:11.641
<i>to tell the wolf
you could share with his wife</i>

34:11.643 --> 34:14.136
<i>the hunter gets
captured by the game</i>

34:14.137 --> 34:16.597
<i>then Leo the lion
will be roaring your name!</i>

34:16.598 --> 34:20.884
<i>yeah, I never met a wolf
who didn't love to howl</i>

34:22.786 --> 34:25.554
<i>no, I never met a man

34:25.556 --> 34:27.389
<i>shimmy, shimmy,
aw, gimme, gimme</i>

34:27.391 --> 34:30.293
<i>if your face and figure
are whistle-bait</i>

34:30.293 --> 34:32.395
<i>honey, you'll have the keys

34:32.396 --> 34:36.732
<i>yeah, I never met a wolf

34:38.467 --> 34:40.568
<i>the three little piggies
sure had it wrong</i>

34:40.569 --> 34:43.237
<i>when the wolf came a-knockin'
in that old song</i>

34:43.237 --> 34:44.973

34:44.974 --> 34:46.841
<i>"Marilyn, I gotcha"</i>

34:46.842 --> 34:48.842
<i>I said, "come on in,"

34:48.844 --> 34:52.013
<i>oh, Frankie!</i>

34:52.014 --> 34:54.148
<i>a wealthy wolf
likes to buy his toys</i>

34:54.149 --> 34:56.717
<i>but he really
is just one of the boys</i>

34:56.717 --> 34:59.386
<i>if you've got something
for which he's craving</i>

34:59.931 --> 35:02.309
<i>it sure is good

35:04.492 --> 35:07.594

35:07.595 --> 35:11.430

35:13.400 --> 35:16.035

<i>tell me where can I sign
on the dotted line?</i>

35:23.248 --> 35:28.847
<i>yeah, I never met a wolf

35:28.848 --> 35:32.284
<i>oh, yeah!</i>

35:46.365 --> 35:47.854
You are thrilling.

35:47.855 --> 35:49.200
Honestly.

35:49.201 --> 35:51.769
Thank you.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.444
Are you still interested
in showing me those bedrooms?

35:57.776 --> 36:00.777
Wonderful.

36:14.804 --> 36:16.705
And this is the third bedroom.

36:16.706 --> 36:18.173
This is even nicer...

36:18.676 --> 36:20.262
Eileen, hi.

36:20.263 --> 36:22.514
I-I'm so sorry.

36:22.515 --> 36:25.647
There's no need
to apologize.

36:25.648 --> 36:30.147
I was just looking
at past happiness.

36:30.148 --> 36:33.454
But you're
my happiness now.

36:33.455 --> 36:35.690
You were wonderful.

36:35.691 --> 36:38.226
Thank you.

36:38.227 --> 36:42.162
I'll be by your office
on Monday, Eileen.

36:50.871 --> 36:53.139
That was so much fun.

36:53.140 --> 36:54.974
I gotta go.

36:54.975 --> 36:57.009
She rocked it, didn't she?

36:57.010 --> 36:58.978
Awesome.

36:58.979 --> 37:00.279
Good night.

37:13.092 --> 37:17.094
That was...

37:17.095 --> 37:20.197
Impressive.

37:20.198 --> 37:22.267
As impressive
as the TV star?

37:22.268 --> 37:24.935
Is there
a TV star here?

37:24.936 --> 37:27.938
I'm too dazzled
by the piano player to notice.

37:34.078 --> 37:36.246
Yay, mom.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.285
Yeah, yeah, no...
Apart from the, uh, explosion

37:41.286 --> 37:42.852
at the Sewage Center
in Queens,

37:42.853 --> 37:44.688
it was an utterly,
wonderfully uneventful weekend.

37:44.689 --> 37:46.356
Is he always
on the phone?

37:46.357 --> 37:48.258
He was in charge of
the press office all weekend.

37:48.259 --> 37:51.260
He's important
and good-looking.

37:51.261 --> 37:55.798
- Stop.
- I've gotta go.

37:55.799 --> 37:57.700
- I'll take care of these.
- I like him.

37:57.701 --> 38:00.903
- Sweet.
- Thank you.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.204
Hi.

38:02.205 --> 38:03.872
- Gosh, I hate shots.
- Cheers.

38:03.873 --> 38:06.040
Bottoms up.

38:06.041 --> 38:08.376
Come on, Iowa, let's show 'em
what the chorus looks like.

38:08.377 --> 38:10.312
- You ready?
- Okay.

38:10.313 --> 38:11.513
- You ready for this?
- We can do this.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.834
- I can do this.
- Come on.

38:22.123 --> 38:24.636
Hang on.
Where are you going?

38:24.637 --> 38:26.593
Don't bother.

38:26.594 --> 38:27.973
I saw you, Derek.

38:27.974 --> 38:30.809
- Saw me what?
- That woman.

38:30.810 --> 38:35.569
I saw you.
Everybody saw you.

38:35.570 --> 38:37.970
Saw me what, flirting?

38:37.971 --> 38:43.309
- Your hand was on her ass.
- Ivy.

38:43.310 --> 38:47.413
Everyone at this party
is a potential investor, okay?

38:47.414 --> 38:49.949
So, yeah, I am gonna flirt,
and I'm gonna put my hand

38:49.950 --> 38:51.913
on the asses
of pretty women

38:51.914 --> 38:54.619
if it makes them
feel that our show

38:54.620 --> 38:56.455
is the one they want
to throw millions of dollars at.

38:56.456 --> 38:57.989
It's meaningless.

38:57.990 --> 38:59.755
How come you didn't
tell me you cast Karen?

38:59.756 --> 39:02.427
She didn't get the part.

39:02.428 --> 39:05.093
You did.

39:05.094 --> 39:08.499
They loved you tonight.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.099
This is who you are now.

39:11.100 --> 39:14.972
Get used to it.

39:14.973 --> 39:18.190
This show means
everything to me.

39:18.191 --> 39:22.986
- I just want to feel safe.
- Then go back to the chorus.

39:22.987 --> 39:25.489
There's nothing safe
about being a star.

39:33.824 --> 39:37.417
You know, the bedrooms here
really are incredible.

39:40.630 --> 39:46.234
Perhaps you should show them
to me then.

39:48.004 --> 39:50.338
Five, six, seven, eight.

39:50.339 --> 39:53.341
<i>She, she ain't real</i>

39:53.342 --> 39:57.479
<i>she ain't gonna be able
to love you like I will</i>

39:57.480 --> 40:02.383
<i>she is a stranger</i>

40:02.384 --> 40:05.820
<i>you and I have history
or don't you remember?</i>

40:05.821 --> 40:09.449
<i>sure, she's
got it all</i>

40:09.858 --> 40:15.562
<i>but, baby, is that really
what you want?</i>

40:15.563 --> 40:18.932
<i>bless your soul, you've got
your head in the clouds</i>

40:18.933 --> 40:21.000
<i>she made a fool
out of you</i>

40:21.001 --> 40:22.936
<i>and, boy,
she's bringing you down</i>

40:22.937 --> 40:25.572
<i>she made
your heart melt</i>

40:25.573 --> 40:27.607
<i>but she's cold
to the core</i>

40:27.608 --> 40:30.910
<i>now rumour has it she
ain't got your love anymore</i>

40:30.911 --> 40:32.545
<i>rumour has it, ooh</i>

40:32.546 --> 40:36.518
<i>rumour has it, ooh,
rumour has it, ooh</i>

40:36.519 --> 40:38.684
<i>rumour has it, ooh</i>

40:38.685 --> 40:41.854
<i>rumour has it, ooh,
rumour has it, ooh</i>

40:41.855 --> 40:46.424
<i>rumour has it, ooh,
rumour has it, ooh</i>

40:57.702 --> 41:01.905
<i>all of these words</i>

41:01.906 --> 41:05.463
<i>whispered in my ear</i>

41:05.464 --> 41:07.877
<i>tell a story that</i>

41:07.878 --> 41:11.761
<i>I cannot bear to hear</i>

41:11.762 --> 41:14.806
<i>just 'cause I said it</i>

41:14.807 --> 41:20.490
<i>don't mean
that I meant it</i>

41:20.491 --> 41:26.490
<i>people say crazy things</i>

41:27.397 --> 41:31.766
<i>just 'cause I said it</i>

41:31.767 --> 41:35.660
<i>don't mean
that I meant it</i>

41:36.006 --> 41:39.740
<i>just 'cause you heard it</i>

41:43.445 --> 41:45.313
<i>rumour has it</i>

41:45.314 --> 41:47.615
<i>rumour has it,
rumour has it</i>

41:59.685 --> 42:03.063
<i>rumour has it</i>

42:06.800 --> 42:08.768
<i>come on now!</i>

42:08.769 --> 42:10.803
<i>rumour has it</i>

42:10.804 --> 42:13.782
<i>he's the one
I'm leaving you for</i>

42:20.713 --> 42:24.167
That was great!...
