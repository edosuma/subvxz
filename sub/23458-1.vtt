01:05.274 --> 01:06.832
Are you awake?

01:09.341 --> 01:11.535
Um, Christian?

01:11.708 --> 01:13.174
Uh, what?

01:13.341 --> 01:14.399
Do you need anything?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.166
It's time for the next one.

01:16.341 --> 01:18.399
What?

01:18.541 --> 01:20.565
It's time for
your next interview.

01:20.741 --> 01:23.298
- Uh, yeah.
- Do you need a few minutes?

01:24.074 --> 01:25.074
A glass of water?

01:25.207 --> 01:27.731
Just give me a couple
of minutes.

01:28.241 --> 01:30.936
- See you in Gallery One.
- Right.

01:36.808 --> 01:38.707
We need a soundcheck.

01:38.875 --> 01:41.034
So, what did you have
for breakfast?

01:42.875 --> 01:47.069
I had some bread,
cheese and cornflakes.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.935
- Uh, an egg.
- I'll just...

01:52.107 --> 01:56.507
Some juice, coffee.
Are we all set?

01:57.741 --> 01:58.935
Hello. Christian.

01:59.074 --> 02:00.735
Hello again.

02:01.241 --> 02:02.868
So, is everything all right?

02:03.608 --> 02:04.734
- Sure.
- Good.

02:04.942 --> 02:06.203
- And you?
- Very well.

02:06.374 --> 02:07.568
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

02:07.908 --> 02:09.738
- Um, grab a chair.
- Yes.

02:09.907 --> 02:12.500
- And let's get...
- Get started.

02:14.775 --> 02:17.003
His checklist
will be right there?

02:19.107 --> 02:20.699
Yeah.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.999
- Sorry.
- All right.

02:28.875 --> 02:31.137
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

02:31.708 --> 02:33.675
- Did you get a level?
- Yeah, we're good.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.331
- And you're comfortable?
- Mm-hm.

02:35.508 --> 02:37.031
Well, that's... Oh, my God.

02:37.207 --> 02:39.197
That's okay.

02:41.775 --> 02:43.901
No, it's just...
No, it's...

02:46.174 --> 02:47.903
Sorry, just a second.

02:52.441 --> 02:53.772
Okay.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.472
Are you rolling?

02:55.575 --> 02:56.633
Can I start over? Yeah.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.003
Yeah, if you can start over.

02:59.174 --> 03:00.936
Thanks.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.231
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

03:04.441 --> 03:05.533
- Yeah.
- We're rolling.

03:05.641 --> 03:06.641
You all set?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.334
- You ready?
- Yes.

03:13.708 --> 03:15.004
Good.

03:17.074 --> 03:19.337
Uh, my first, um...

03:19.441 --> 03:21.237
question's a broad one.

03:21.608 --> 03:26.507
What are the biggest challenges
in running a museum like this?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.372
I hate to say it,
but it's probably money.

03:30.608 --> 03:33.404
Um, raising sufficient funds.

03:33.541 --> 03:36.508
We're a museum of modern
and contemporary art.

03:37.174 --> 03:40.835
So we need to present art that
is absolutely the art of today,

03:41.074 --> 03:43.303
the future, art that is
absolutely cutting edge,

03:43.408 --> 03:44.500
and that's expensive.

03:44.608 --> 03:46.666
And the competition is fierce,

03:46.941 --> 03:48.568
because you've got
buyers and collectors

03:48.708 --> 03:50.348
from all over the world
with so much money

03:50.508 --> 03:52.600
you can't believe it.
They spend more in an afternoon

03:52.808 --> 03:54.741
- than we spend in a year.
- Mm.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.770
Whereas, if we buy
that piece of art

03:56.907 --> 03:58.670
we'll be able
to present it here.

03:58.808 --> 04:01.468
To a large audience, to all
of Stockholm and Sweden

04:01.575 --> 04:03.405
and perhaps even visitors.

04:03.941 --> 04:07.033
So I think it's actually
an obligation for us

04:07.575 --> 04:10.508
to, um... to get into
that competition

04:10.641 --> 04:13.733
and present...
art that is absolutely...

04:13.907 --> 04:16.305
I agree.
I agree absolutely.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.533
- It's key. Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.901
Well... 'cause I wanted
to ask you

04:21.041 --> 04:22.940
about something that I read
on your website.

04:23.174 --> 04:24.936
- All right.
- That I didn't understand.

04:25.174 --> 04:26.983
And I was hoping that you could
help me to understand.

04:27.007 --> 04:28.406
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

04:28.575 --> 04:30.337
Do you mind
if I read this to you?

04:30.575 --> 04:32.235
- Please do.
- Yeah.

04:32.807 --> 04:35.036
Um, May 30-31.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.567
"Exhibition/Non-exhibition.

04:37.775 --> 04:40.173
An evening conversation
that explores the dynamics

04:40.408 --> 04:42.068
of the 'exhibitable'

04:42.207 --> 04:43.551
and the construction
of public-ness

04:43.575 --> 04:45.064
in the spirit of
Robert Smithson's

04:45.207 --> 04:46.538
<i>Site/Non-site.</i>

04:46.941 --> 04:48.568
From non-site to site,

04:48.708 --> 04:50.028
from non-exhibition
to exhibition,

04:50.174 --> 04:53.039
what is the topos of
exhibition/ non-exhibition

04:53.174 --> 04:55.902
in the crowded moments
of mega exhibition?"

05:00.741 --> 05:01.741
Can I?

05:01.807 --> 05:03.240
- Do you want to read it?
- Yeah.

05:03.408 --> 05:06.204
- Um...
- Yeah, I just don't...

05:06.374 --> 05:09.466
I'm sorry, I'm clearly not
as scholarly as you are.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.936
I was just hoping
that you could...

05:13.575 --> 05:15.405
Well, this is, um...

05:17.508 --> 05:19.940
This was a couple
of evenings in May

05:20.041 --> 05:22.201
where we discussed, um...

05:27.641 --> 05:29.903
When... when...

05:30.174 --> 05:32.902
I mean, if you place
an object in a museum

05:33.374 --> 05:36.500
does that make this object
a piece of art?

05:36.641 --> 05:37.505
Hm.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.472
For instance,
if we took your bag,

05:39.575 --> 05:41.474
and placed it here...

05:43.641 --> 05:46.005
would that make it art?

05:46.241 --> 05:47.832
Ah.

05:51.608 --> 05:53.006
Okay.

05:53.174 --> 05:54.573
Does that answer your question?

05:54.740 --> 05:57.333
Yes, it does. I think. Yeah.

05:59.241 --> 06:03.140
Well, that is all we have.

08:01.441 --> 08:04.340
I need a hand over here...

08:13.107 --> 08:16.938
The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.

08:17.074 --> 08:19.200
Within its boundaries,
we all share

08:19.341 --> 08:22.069
equal rights
and obligations.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.200
Do you want to save
a human life?

08:47.607 --> 08:48.938
Do you want to save
a human life?

08:49.107 --> 08:50.937
Not right now.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.933
Do you want to save
a human life?

08:56.074 --> 08:58.666
Do you want to save
a human life?

08:58.874 --> 09:00.150
Do you want to save
a human life?

09:00.174 --> 09:03.663
Sorry?

09:18.874 --> 09:20.898
Help!

09:26.174 --> 09:28.334
Help!

09:30.774 --> 09:32.764
Help!!

09:35.408 --> 09:36.669
Help!!!

09:36.774 --> 09:39.071
You have to help me,
he's going to kill me!

09:39.241 --> 09:41.140
- Hey, calm down.
- He's going to kill me.

09:41.241 --> 09:42.071
Help! Please!

09:42.241 --> 09:43.502
- What's the matter?
- Help me,

09:43.607 --> 09:45.904
he's going to kill me!

09:46.041 --> 09:47.803
Get a grip on yourself!

09:48.041 --> 09:51.372
- He's going to kill you too!
- Calm down! Shut up!

09:58.707 --> 10:01.538
- Hey, back me up here!
- But I don't...

10:01.774 --> 10:08.470
- Okay, what's going on?
- Someone's howling over there.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.471
- I can't see anyone.
- He's going to kill us!

10:10.607 --> 10:12.938
- Would you calm down!
- He's going to kill us!

10:17.107 --> 10:20.302
- No, no...!
- No, don't...

10:22.607 --> 10:26.132
- What the hell?!
- Cool the fuck down!

10:26.507 --> 10:30.531
- I wasn't going after you guys!
- What the hell?

10:31.607 --> 10:33.699
Have a nice day, guys.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.074
- Bloody idiot!
- What a bloody idiot!

10:42.740 --> 10:46.196
- Bloody idiot!
- What the hell just happened?

10:47.274 --> 10:50.002
That was insane...

10:50.640 --> 10:54.233
What a fucking idiot! Jesus...

10:54.507 --> 10:55.769
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:55.974 --> 10:58.497
- Is your heart pounding?
- Yeah.

10:59.274 --> 11:01.536
My heart's like...

11:01.774 --> 11:04.570
Good thinking,
getting me in on it.

11:04.974 --> 11:06.600
I just reacted.

11:08.074 --> 11:11.507
Asking for help,
that was really smart.

11:11.807 --> 11:16.070
- I was scared, how about you?
- Well...

11:16.774 --> 11:19.173
Shit.

11:21.174 --> 11:24.198
- Right...
- Yeah, all right.

11:25.574 --> 11:29.133
- Take care!
- Have a nice day.

12:04.373 --> 12:07.307
Excuse me, may I please
borrow your phone?

12:07.874 --> 12:09.363
Could you please help me?

12:09.507 --> 12:11.304
Could I please borrow
your phone?

12:12.341 --> 12:13.898
I just need some help.

12:34.373 --> 12:35.567
Excuse me. Um...

12:35.807 --> 12:38.001
You're on your way to
the art exhibition now?

12:38.907 --> 12:41.772
Yeah, castle is over there.

12:42.274 --> 12:43.501
Oh.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.302
Have you seen
any of his work before?

13:05.440 --> 13:07.135
No.

13:15.041 --> 13:18.303
This is
what "The Square" looks like.

13:18.540 --> 13:20.007
Right.

13:22.207 --> 13:27.469
And the exhibition
will open on September 15.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.665
That's right.
I've booked

13:29.907 --> 13:31.533
the usual
billboards,

13:31.974 --> 13:37.169
and ad space in two
of the major daily newspapers.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.871
Okay.

13:40.373 --> 13:41.653
So we've done some prep already.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.366
Right. You see...

13:47.974 --> 13:51.668
Listen, this is
a very nice project

13:51.774 --> 13:54.536
that raises important issues.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.498
But, from a communications
point of view,

13:58.907 --> 14:01.136
the values are too general.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.540
We need to talk about
the difference

14:03.707 --> 14:07.697
between art and marketing.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.905
I totally agree.

14:10.174 --> 14:15.300
For every new project, we need
to assess how newsworthy it is.

14:17.041 --> 14:22.565
What makes this exhibition
stand out?

14:22.740 --> 14:24.570
Does it involve any controversy?

14:24.740 --> 14:27.207
Can we tie it to trends
or current events?

14:27.774 --> 14:31.003
If not, you're stuck
with the billboards.

14:31.240 --> 14:35.230
That makes it hard to generate
any international attention.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.680
Then you'll only reach
the usual "culture vultures".

14:37.807 --> 14:40.296
To get journalists
to write about it,

14:40.407 --> 14:42.670
you need some controversy.

14:43.373 --> 14:48.466
Only this project doesn't really
have much of an edge.

14:49.206 --> 14:53.867
As a journalist, I want
to create my own standpoint.

14:54.974 --> 14:58.532
Like most people, I want to
express an opinion

14:58.740 --> 15:01.400
that isn't just consensus.

15:01.974 --> 15:04.236
I'd never post
a Facebook status like

15:04.373 --> 15:06.136
"Daniel wants peace on Earth."

15:07.107 --> 15:09.573
- So...
- Hang on.

15:09.707 --> 15:13.731
There's more to this exhibition
than a Facebook update.

15:14.273 --> 15:15.706
Of course.

15:15.941 --> 15:18.237
Its strength lies
in its simplicity.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.168
That's what we
should communicate.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.505
Definitely,
just let me read this.

15:25.807 --> 15:28.036
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.

15:28.206 --> 15:29.901
Within its boundaries,

15:30.041 --> 15:32.769
we all share equal rights
and obligations."

15:34.173 --> 15:36.299
No one would disagree with that.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.202
So why should I,
as a journalist, care?

15:39.373 --> 15:42.397
Well... You dropped this.

15:42.707 --> 15:47.163
My point is, that this isn't
about the statement.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.773
What's important is...

15:48.974 --> 15:52.407
what this square activates
in its audience.

15:52.540 --> 15:53.540
We understand.

15:53.607 --> 15:55.597
That's what we want
to communicate.

15:55.807 --> 15:57.899
May I clarify something?

15:58.206 --> 16:03.230
The guys aren't disputing
the legitimacy of the project.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.202
As long as we agree
on the content.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.498
And they're not questioning
what you're trying to explore.

16:09.807 --> 16:12.672
They're simply trying to explain
how the media landscape works,

16:13.074 --> 16:16.871
and what it takes
to make an impact.

16:19.106 --> 16:22.665
I've been thinking...

16:23.373 --> 16:28.898
How about doing something
like the Ice Bucket Challenge?

16:29.340 --> 16:33.171
Yeah, that's a good
idea. Only what was it?

16:33.740 --> 16:36.502
It was a viral success...

16:36.707 --> 16:37.707
Well,

16:37.907 --> 16:44.704
ordinary people, or celebrities,
filmed themselves

16:44.941 --> 16:48.772
getting buckets of ice-water
poured all over them.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.771
And it went viral.

16:51.941 --> 16:53.771
It was huge!

16:53.907 --> 16:55.874
It was
all over the place.

16:56.106 --> 16:58.471
Sure, but what
was the point of it all?

16:58.707 --> 17:00.173
There was no point.

17:00.273 --> 17:03.536
You make it
sound corny.

17:03.974 --> 17:08.464
It was to promote ALS research.
It generated one billion kronor,

17:08.807 --> 17:11.898
so it was a very successful
campaign,

17:12.040 --> 17:15.064
but it wouldn't
be viable here.

17:15.607 --> 17:20.007
Your ambition level is high.
Our ambition level is high.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.299
Together, we should shoot
for something bold.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.205
I agree.

17:26.339 --> 17:28.001
That's what we're trying
to explain.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.937
We need to take a leap.

17:32.106 --> 17:35.596
Do something fresh.
And these guys know how.

17:35.874 --> 17:40.204
They were born into
this fast-moving arena.

17:40.373 --> 17:46.034
- It's their home turf.
- Perfect.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.930
We have everything we need,

17:49.106 --> 17:52.835
so let's go back
to the drawing board.

17:52.974 --> 17:55.463
Next week
we'll present our ideas

17:55.607 --> 17:57.403
and we'll take it from there.

17:57.574 --> 17:59.700
Sounds great.

17:59.874 --> 18:02.238
Good,
sounds exciting.

18:02.407 --> 18:06.363
- Can we keep these?
- Sure.

18:06.540 --> 18:11.030
This will be great, Christian.
So, how are things?

18:11.206 --> 18:14.230
The craziest thing
just happened.

18:14.373 --> 18:15.373
What?

18:15.540 --> 18:17.530
The craziest thing
happened to me.

18:17.774 --> 18:18.774
Today?

18:18.807 --> 18:21.467
Listen, I want you all
to hear this.

18:22.206 --> 18:25.139
It's
un-fucking-believable.

18:25.707 --> 18:29.401
And after Christian
says goodbye to the other guy,

18:29.574 --> 18:32.405
he checks his pockets
and his wallet,

18:32.574 --> 18:34.837
his phone and
his cufflinks are gone.

18:34.941 --> 18:36.202
You must be kidding!

18:36.340 --> 18:39.466
I don't understand
how they did it.

18:43.973 --> 18:46.372
And now my phone
is down there.

18:46.540 --> 18:49.995
- It's really close.
- And we're here.

18:50.173 --> 18:51.663
So surreal...

18:51.807 --> 18:54.239
Hello...

18:54.407 --> 18:56.670
Elna, check this out.

18:56.807 --> 18:59.672
I need a print
of the press release.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.398
Come here.

19:03.440 --> 19:08.840
- Can you see what that is?
- No.

19:08.973 --> 19:12.407
Of course you can't.
Well, it's my phone.

19:12.574 --> 19:17.667
On my way to work this morning,
I was robbed.

19:17.807 --> 19:21.672
They took my phone,
they took my wallet,

19:21.807 --> 19:26.137
and they even took my cufflinks!

19:26.273 --> 19:29.138
I have no idea how they did it.

19:29.273 --> 19:31.206
So what do you say?

19:35.273 --> 19:37.933
Is that your work phone?

19:39.640 --> 19:42.539
It's the only phone I have.

19:42.707 --> 19:46.731
Work or private,
it's the phone I use.

19:50.540 --> 19:53.904
- It's almost time, isn't it?
- Yes.

19:54.073 --> 19:57.404
- See you out there.
- I'm on my way.

19:57.574 --> 20:00.473
- Will you...?
- Sure.

20:00.607 --> 20:03.403
We'll talk about
the next step later on.

20:03.574 --> 20:04.904
Yeah.

20:11.906 --> 20:15.067
We will be presenting
the Argentinean artist

20:15.206 --> 20:17.764
and
sociologist Lola Arias.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.573
Lola's art is inspired by
Nicolas Bourriaud,

20:21.740 --> 20:25.173
and his thoughts
on relational aesthetics.

20:25.340 --> 20:28.864
In short, relational
aesthetics explores

20:29.040 --> 20:33.167
how we relate to each other
in a social context.

20:38.507 --> 20:40.406
I'm sorry, this all sounds
very stiff.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.464
May I start over again?

20:46.607 --> 20:49.199
Would that be okay?
Cool.

20:51.740 --> 20:55.332
I'll lose the notes...
I don't need them.

20:55.873 --> 20:58.840
Now off with these...

21:00.273 --> 21:04.138
Because the project
I'd like to tell you about...

21:05.073 --> 21:07.869
It means so much to me
that I'd prefer to speak

21:07.973 --> 21:09.463
from the heart.

21:10.340 --> 21:13.535
This is a very special night.

21:13.740 --> 21:17.173
Our museum has
received a donation

21:17.440 --> 21:22.339
from Anna-Stina and Gunnar's
foundation: 50 million kronor.

21:31.173 --> 21:34.299
Now I'd like to ask
our chief curator, Christian,

21:34.440 --> 21:37.305
to tell you about
our first acquisition

21:37.440 --> 21:41.237
with this donation,
a piece known as "The Square",

21:41.407 --> 21:45.204
which you may
have seen on your way in.

21:45.373 --> 21:49.897
An exhibition will also
be tied to this artwork.

21:50.073 --> 21:52.040
Thank you for joining us,
Christian.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.735
Um, Dear Friends of the Museum,

22:01.906 --> 22:04.771
we will be presenting
the Argentinean artist

22:04.906 --> 22:07.237
and sociologist Lola Arias,

22:07.373 --> 22:09.363
and her artwork "The Square".

22:10.707 --> 22:14.470
Lola's art is inspired
by Nicolas Bourriaud,

22:14.973 --> 22:18.134
and his thoughts
on relational aesthetics...

22:19.707 --> 22:21.571
What's so funny?

22:21.707 --> 22:25.504
Oh, a phone is ringing?
Is it for me?

22:28.707 --> 22:30.196
Let's wait and see.

22:31.507 --> 22:33.905
Erik? Is it for me?

22:34.440 --> 22:38.770
My mother usually calls
at this hour.

22:42.773 --> 22:44.070
Um...

22:44.206 --> 22:47.367
May I take this opportunity
to start over?

22:47.940 --> 22:54.306
It all felt a bit too stiff.
Let me lose the mic.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.300
I'd like you to
do something for me.

23:05.773 --> 23:07.740
Are you game? Okay.

23:07.906 --> 23:12.135
I'm asking you to imagine
that you are standing

23:12.574 --> 23:15.234
in a public place in town.

23:16.106 --> 23:17.697
Such as Odenplan,

23:17.873 --> 23:22.932
or any other large city plaza.

23:23.607 --> 23:25.732
Are you there now? Okay.

23:25.873 --> 23:29.772
It's an ordinary day and
lots of people are in motion.

23:30.106 --> 23:31.300
You look down

23:31.407 --> 23:34.568
and see that you are standing
inside a square,

23:35.273 --> 23:39.297
a clearly defined
4 x 4 meter square.

23:40.706 --> 23:44.196
That's what "The Square"
is on a physical plane.

23:44.607 --> 23:49.165
It's like an empty frame
waiting for its contents.

23:49.340 --> 23:53.705
Lola Arias compares "The Square"
to a pedestrian crossing.

23:53.873 --> 24:00.773
A pedestrian crossing
involves a clear-cut contract:

24:00.940 --> 24:03.498
Drivers are to look out
for pedestrians.

24:03.639 --> 24:07.403
In a similar way,
there is a contract

24:07.574 --> 24:11.063
implied by "The Square",
to look out for each other.

24:12.806 --> 24:14.330
We help each other.

24:14.574 --> 24:18.836
If you enter this space
and ask for help,

24:18.973 --> 24:21.940
anyone passing by
is obligated to help you.

24:25.073 --> 24:26.370
"I'm hungry.

24:26.873 --> 24:30.238
Can you help me with a meal?"

24:32.940 --> 24:34.998
"Can you teach me how to swim?"

24:38.340 --> 24:42.467
"My father just died
and I have no one to talk to.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.404
Could you spare me
30 minutes of your time?"

24:51.106 --> 24:55.130
Some of you may be thinking
that this sounds naive.

24:55.273 --> 24:58.001
Maybe even utopian.

25:15.773 --> 25:17.365
Thank you.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.929
Thank you.

25:23.507 --> 25:26.905
The exhibit opens
in late summer,

25:27.073 --> 25:29.562
and you just can't miss it.

25:29.739 --> 25:35.298
And now I hope you're hungry.
We have a treat for you.

25:35.440 --> 25:39.702
Jonas, will you
present the food?

25:39.873 --> 25:42.500
I'm sure you'll do that
better than me.

25:44.373 --> 25:46.363
- Hello!
- Hello.

25:46.539 --> 25:49.597
We've prepared
a lovely buffet for you.

25:49.773 --> 25:52.206
Corn-fed chicken
smothered in mushrooms,

25:52.373 --> 25:55.135
asparagus marinated
in truffle oil...

25:57.340 --> 26:00.330
And celeriac
roasted to sweet perfection...

26:00.706 --> 26:03.673
Please don't rush.

26:03.806 --> 26:05.568
Slow down!

26:10.273 --> 26:12.331
There's a sauce, too.

26:12.506 --> 26:14.905
Pan juices refined with
a touch of balsamic vinegar,

26:15.040 --> 26:16.666
honey and sage.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.473
Enjoy!

26:27.106 --> 26:30.561
Can I ask you something?
The GPS in my car...

26:30.739 --> 26:31.739
Yeah.

26:31.873 --> 26:34.704
It's always about 50 meters off.

26:34.873 --> 26:39.704
- Is that location reliable?
- It's right there.

26:39.873 --> 26:44.034
- It may be 10 meters off, tops.
- That's too much.

26:44.206 --> 26:47.071
We may not know which flat,

26:47.240 --> 26:49.366
but we can be certain
of the building.

26:49.539 --> 26:52.472
Listen, I have an idea.

26:52.606 --> 26:55.130
Let's write a threatening letter

26:55.273 --> 26:58.069
that we distribute
in the building,

26:58.240 --> 27:01.139
putting it in
all the letterboxes.

27:01.273 --> 27:03.933
That way, we get to
whoever did this.

27:04.106 --> 27:05.766
There could be 15 floors.

27:05.940 --> 27:09.396
- So what? It's not a problem.
- 8 flats on each floor...

27:09.573 --> 27:12.063
I'll do it. It's fine.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.298
Isn't a threat a bit
over the top?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.497
"To the person who robbed me,

27:18.639 --> 27:21.072
I'll bash your head in
if you don't return my stuff."

27:21.240 --> 27:25.230
No, no. Come on,
that's way too violent.

27:25.407 --> 27:30.170
These people are criminals,
that's how they roll.

27:30.340 --> 27:33.670
It doesn't justify
bad behavior from us.

27:33.806 --> 27:36.568
Don't be so Swedish!

27:36.739 --> 27:38.331
Ditch the political
correctness crap.

27:38.506 --> 27:41.905
They should fucking
pay for this.

27:46.539 --> 27:52.235
"We know who you are
and where you live, obviously,

27:52.406 --> 27:56.863
or you wouldn't
be getting this."

27:57.040 --> 28:00.598
Good one.
Very good.

28:00.773 --> 28:05.002
- And then they...
- Hang on!

28:05.173 --> 28:08.765
"We know who you are
and obviously where you live,

28:08.940 --> 28:12.771
or this would never
have reached you."

28:21.240 --> 28:23.173
New paragraph.

28:23.340 --> 28:24.772
Um...

28:24.940 --> 28:30.396
"Return my wallet,
my phone, and the cufflinks

28:30.573 --> 28:34.029
that once belonged
to my grandfather."

28:34.206 --> 28:36.570
They were my grandfather's.

28:37.206 --> 28:40.196
- I'll type while you eat.
- Sure.

28:41.573 --> 28:46.404
Okay if I ditch Comic Sans?
Find something less childlike.

28:46.573 --> 28:51.597
I didn't pick it.
It's a 90s all-time favorite.

28:52.073 --> 28:54.131
Now it won't look like

28:54.340 --> 28:56.829
a kid's birthday party
invitation.

28:56.973 --> 29:00.202
- After all, it is a threat!
- This is insane!

29:03.406 --> 29:06.373
- Go on. Continue.
- Just a second.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.563
"My phone"...

29:08.739 --> 29:12.173
"...and my grandfather's
cufflinks within 24 hours"...

29:12.339 --> 29:17.239
You missed the "my"
in front of grandfather.

29:19.573 --> 29:23.007
"My wallet, my phone,
and grandfather's cufflinks"...

29:24.739 --> 29:30.764
It's getting v-e-r-y personal.

29:30.940 --> 29:35.203
"...to the 7-Eleven
by the Central Station

29:35.372 --> 29:37.203
or we'll be back..."

29:37.372 --> 29:38.703
Should we add a skull?

29:38.873 --> 29:43.704
No emoticons,
that's for texting.

29:43.873 --> 29:48.068
- Right, it's too childish.
- Let's print this shit!

29:48.240 --> 29:53.037
- Let's go!
- 50 copies.

29:58.206 --> 30:02.832
They're driving
like bloody maniacs!

30:05.639 --> 30:07.038
Could we listen
to some music?

30:07.173 --> 30:08.901
Sure.

30:09.073 --> 30:12.403
How about a golden oldie
from back home...

30:14.606 --> 30:15.903
Gasoline!

30:16.073 --> 30:20.597
Don't you have anything
more upbeat?

30:24.973 --> 30:27.202
This is more upbeat.

30:27.806 --> 30:32.240
Cool, you've got Justice.
Track 5.

30:32.406 --> 30:37.465
- What?
- Justice. Track 5.

30:37.606 --> 30:39.766
That's the one.
It's awesome. Put it on.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.134
Okay.

30:43.706 --> 30:47.231
Yes.

30:47.406 --> 30:48.998
Come on, crank it up loud.

30:49.173 --> 30:51.696
I haven't listened to Justice
for ages.

30:57.873 --> 31:00.601
The paradox is that
they're called Justice.

31:00.773 --> 31:02.364
And what are we out to get?

31:02.539 --> 31:08.564
- That's not a paradox.
- Well, maybe not...

31:08.739 --> 31:11.070
But we're out to get justice,
aren't we?

31:11.239 --> 31:12.763
Yeah.

31:12.940 --> 31:17.202
- That's great timing!
- It certainly is.

31:17.372 --> 31:20.396
Are you ready?
Turn it up!

31:22.906 --> 31:26.135
Isn't this great?

31:29.173 --> 31:35.299
This is what happens
when they steal your phone.

31:35.439 --> 31:39.566
- We're coming with the cavalry!
- Coming at them with a hammer.

31:39.739 --> 31:44.570
- A great, big hammer.
- Out for justice...

31:44.739 --> 31:46.672
In a Tesla.

31:49.773 --> 31:54.172
- The Tesla of Justice!
- You're crazy.

32:07.239 --> 32:10.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:27.506 --> 32:31.530
Are you going?
One of us has to watch the car.

32:31.706 --> 32:33.138
I'll do it.

32:34.406 --> 32:38.396
- You'll do what?
- I'll watch the car.

32:41.773 --> 32:43.831
I'll watch the car.

32:50.106 --> 32:56.232
This is kind of
embarrassing, but...

32:56.406 --> 33:00.134
You are aware that I'm
sort of a semi-public figure?

33:00.272 --> 33:02.933
- Yeah, yeah.
- People know who I am.

33:03.105 --> 33:07.903
There's a good chance
I'll be recognized.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.596
Not here.

33:09.773 --> 33:12.740
They wouldn't know
who you are.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.506
True.

33:14.639 --> 33:18.073
But I wasn't the one
who was robbed.

33:18.239 --> 33:21.331
But this was your idea.
Oh, yes, it was.

33:21.506 --> 33:25.701
You suggested writing
a letter. Right?

33:25.873 --> 33:32.238
I just wanted to help out.
So I can't see why...

33:32.406 --> 33:36.669
Let's just skip the whole thing,
it doesn't matter.

33:38.072 --> 33:40.198
Let's get out of here.

33:49.606 --> 33:51.937
Give me your jacket.

33:52.105 --> 33:55.732
I can't go in there
in this suit.

33:55.906 --> 33:58.839
Hand over your jacket,
you sissy.

33:58.973 --> 34:02.599
Being a sissy
has nothing to do with it.

34:02.773 --> 34:05.035
You're a sissy!

34:05.205 --> 34:07.866
Hang on. I'm sorry...

34:17.438 --> 34:21.998
Do you remember saying
you'd run in with the letters?

34:22.172 --> 34:24.139
- I never said that.
- You did.

34:24.272 --> 34:27.831
Let me refresh your memory:
"It's dead easy, you just..."

34:29.406 --> 34:31.565
- I did say that.
- You did.

34:31.739 --> 34:35.331
But I never said
I'd do it, personally.

34:35.505 --> 34:41.337
As your boss, I'm curious
to know if I can count on you.

34:41.505 --> 34:45.735
If you promise to do something,
can I count on you?

34:45.906 --> 34:48.371
- Of course you can.
- Really?

34:48.539 --> 34:52.563
I'm willing to overlook it
this time, but in the future?

34:52.739 --> 34:55.205
You can count on me.
Yeah, yeah.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.036
That's cool.

35:11.039 --> 35:14.063
Motherfuckers...

35:14.239 --> 35:16.729
<i>Thirteenth floor.</i>

35:31.606 --> 35:33.903
<i>Going down.</i>

37:24.372 --> 37:27.362
Hello?!

38:05.272 --> 38:07.000
Shit.

38:16.872 --> 38:19.305
This is totally insane.

38:33.039 --> 38:34.506
Come on!

38:44.539 --> 38:47.028
Oh, fuck!

38:47.205 --> 38:51.934
Yes, this is my car,
but I'm kind of busy.

38:52.105 --> 38:55.595
It's a cool car.
Could you start it up?

38:55.772 --> 38:58.296
- What?
- Start it up. Drive...

38:59.872 --> 39:03.896
Could you please not touch it?

39:04.072 --> 39:07.732
- You might scratch it.
- I'm not doing anything.

39:07.905 --> 39:09.838
I just want you
to start her up.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.996
No, I don't feel like it.

39:13.172 --> 39:17.935
Come on, don't be such a drag,
I've never seen one of these.

39:18.105 --> 39:23.061
It's just an ordinary car.
Nothing special, dead boring.

39:23.239 --> 39:25.536
Have a nice evening.

39:37.939 --> 39:39.167
What the hell?

39:39.272 --> 39:41.239
What do you think you're doing?

39:42.039 --> 39:44.006
- What are you doing?
- Whatever I want.

39:44.172 --> 39:48.367
Listen, stop this crap...

39:48.539 --> 39:50.130
- Go! Go!
- What?

39:50.272 --> 39:53.932
All right! Get in!

40:25.239 --> 40:28.570
I think we hit something.

40:28.738 --> 40:31.296
Yeah,
I guess we did...

40:41.705 --> 40:46.366
Could you pull over...
so I can take a look?

41:46.272 --> 41:52.297
Please, I have three children
and diabetes. One krona?

41:54.105 --> 41:58.197
Excuse me...
Please, one krona?

42:00.772 --> 42:06.933
- Thank you, ma'am.
- A little money? Thank you.

42:07.339 --> 42:12.204
Thank you, ma'am.
Please, kind ma'am.

42:14.805 --> 42:19.068
Hello, help me...
One krona, please.

42:20.939 --> 42:25.770
Hello, help me.
One krona, please.

42:25.939 --> 42:29.236
Thank you.
Help me, please.

42:31.072 --> 42:33.301
Do you want
to save a human life?

42:35.605 --> 42:39.164
Do you want
to save a human life?

42:39.339 --> 42:42.306
Do you want
to save a human life?

42:54.805 --> 42:56.829
- Hello.
- Hi.

42:57.772 --> 42:59.034
How are you today?

43:01.306 --> 43:02.795
Money...

43:03.505 --> 43:06.473
Sorry, I don't have any cash.

43:06.605 --> 43:10.039
But I could buy you
something to eat.

43:10.205 --> 43:12.138
Chicken ciabatta.

43:14.372 --> 43:18.032
- What?
- Chicken ciabatta.

43:19.805 --> 43:23.204
- Okay, chicken ciabatta.
- Yeah.

43:24.905 --> 43:26.929
- Hey...
- Yeah?

43:30.172 --> 43:31.729
What did you say?

43:33.805 --> 43:36.034
- "No onions?"
- Yeah.

43:40.172 --> 43:41.536
Okay.

43:44.139 --> 43:45.571
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:45.738 --> 43:48.001
I'd like a pay-as-you-go
SIM card

43:48.172 --> 43:50.536
and one chicken ciabatta.

43:55.872 --> 43:58.703
Has anyone dropped off
a parcel or letter

43:58.872 --> 44:01.339
addressed to "Christian"?

44:03.172 --> 44:04.502
Peggy?

44:06.139 --> 44:08.333
- Peggy?
- Yes?

44:08.505 --> 44:10.995
Has anybody
dropped off a parcel?

44:11.172 --> 44:14.003
A parcel?

44:14.172 --> 44:17.696
A parcel or a letter
for Christian?

44:18.572 --> 44:21.005
- No.
- Nothing?

44:23.738 --> 44:26.137
- Sorry.
- Okay.

44:28.005 --> 44:29.494
Have a nice day.

44:29.638 --> 44:34.503
Here's your ciabatta.
Pick the onions out yourself.

44:34.638 --> 44:36.935
Hey. Hey!

45:11.239 --> 45:12.398
Sir?

45:12.572 --> 45:15.062
No picture.

45:15.239 --> 45:17.865
<i>My starting point
with this installation</i>

45:18.039 --> 45:21.528
<i>as with probably all
my art over the last...</i>

45:21.705 --> 45:23.763
...six years, um...

45:25.239 --> 45:26.933
Uh...

45:27.105 --> 45:30.731
My starting point was
my immediate surroundings

45:30.905 --> 45:34.168
and, uh... uh...

45:34.339 --> 45:36.669
and uses everyday objects

45:36.805 --> 45:42.898
to explore the meaning of one's
human response to art.

45:43.072 --> 45:47.005
By that, I mean
they are framed instances

45:47.172 --> 45:51.196
that would shine a light
on everyday objects

45:51.371 --> 45:54.168
which might normally
be not noticed

45:54.338 --> 45:56.362
in their original context.

45:56.538 --> 45:58.732
I was interested,
for example, in...

46:00.105 --> 46:03.697
What happens when
a landscape painting

46:03.872 --> 46:05.203
is hung in a gallery.

46:05.371 --> 46:08.861
How does that landscape
relate to its...

46:09.039 --> 46:10.596
to the space of the gallery,

46:10.772 --> 46:14.466
how does that space
relate to the space

46:14.605 --> 46:18.766
inside one's own head?
Inside one's psyche, so that...

46:19.105 --> 46:22.038
Cock, goddammit!

46:30.105 --> 46:31.401
Um...

46:31.572 --> 46:33.233
You were
talking about landscape,

46:33.405 --> 46:37.203
and that reminds me of
the late Robert Smithson,

46:37.371 --> 46:41.066
who, in the 60s and 70s,
was very famous for his...

46:41.239 --> 46:42.671
Garbage!

46:42.805 --> 46:47.397
Um, of photography and, uh...
and the landscape.

46:47.572 --> 46:53.403
And, um, he used material such
as soil, rock and leaves

46:53.572 --> 46:55.869
and mixed it with
other materials, like...

46:56.039 --> 46:58.301
Show us your boobs!

47:00.972 --> 47:05.337
We apologize,
my husband has Tourette's.

47:05.505 --> 47:08.870
- Other materials such as...
- Tourette's?

47:10.405 --> 47:12.599
- Please, carry on.
- Yeah, um...

47:12.772 --> 47:14.739
So the piece of art
is created,

47:14.905 --> 47:16.838
when you're talking
about earth art...

47:16.972 --> 47:19.461
Whore!

47:19.605 --> 47:23.504
By introducing materials
such as concrete, metal,

47:23.638 --> 47:27.128
to rocks and soils and leaves,
is that something...

47:27.271 --> 47:31.329
Is that a headline for
the work you do? I mean...

47:31.505 --> 47:34.336
- Fuck off!
- That's enough.

47:36.605 --> 47:40.402
Sorry. Sorry...

47:40.572 --> 47:44.528
Smithson was a friend
of mine, in fact, when I was...

47:46.405 --> 47:48.463
He was interested
in the aesthetics

47:48.605 --> 47:51.868
of earth and the products
of the earth,

47:52.039 --> 47:53.719
and I'm interested
in using those products,

47:53.805 --> 47:55.704
- but not in their aesthetic.
- Garbage!

47:55.872 --> 47:58.805
Cocksucker! Whore!

47:59.405 --> 48:02.463
- This is outrageous.
- I'm sorry.

48:02.605 --> 48:04.902
If everyone
that can be quiet,

48:05.072 --> 48:07.130
please try to be quiet.

48:07.271 --> 48:10.204
Shut up!
Go home! Fuck off!

48:10.371 --> 48:12.032
If the artist
is okay with it...

48:12.204 --> 48:14.398
We have
this one opportunity

48:14.572 --> 48:19.063
to meet this fantastic artist...

48:19.238 --> 48:21.501
Show us your boobs!

48:21.638 --> 48:25.503
Let's continue.
Everyone is welcome,

48:25.638 --> 48:28.332
irrespective of views...

48:29.772 --> 48:32.671
Um, yeah...

48:32.805 --> 48:35.772
Have you seen
the exhibition downstairs?

48:35.939 --> 48:38.405
You've seen it?
Did you like it?

48:38.572 --> 48:40.039
Garbage!

48:40.204 --> 48:41.466
Okay.

48:41.605 --> 48:43.129
- I liked it.
- Okay.

48:43.271 --> 48:45.238
What do you want to say?

48:46.438 --> 48:47.735
Go home! Fuck off! Suck cock!

48:50.805 --> 48:52.601
We can't hear a thing.

48:52.805 --> 48:56.329
The atmosphere
is stressing him out...

48:57.705 --> 48:59.296
Shut up! Go home!

49:00.338 --> 49:02.237
Camel toe!

49:03.072 --> 49:05.903
Try to be a bit tolerant.

49:06.638 --> 49:08.537
The man is suffering

49:08.705 --> 49:10.171
from a neuropsychiatric
disorder.

49:10.705 --> 49:15.161
This isn't voluntary,
so show some tolerance.

49:17.338 --> 49:18.464
Uh, yeah.

49:18.605 --> 49:19.902
You're very welcome here.

49:20.072 --> 49:22.402
I don't see any reason
for any other interruptions.

50:25.039 --> 50:26.300
Fuck!

50:57.872 --> 50:59.702
What are you up to?

51:06.905 --> 51:09.064
Algot, come here.

51:17.538 --> 51:20.198
She's off her rocker...

51:32.805 --> 51:37.067
Hello, my name is Christian.
I believe you called me?

52:22.772 --> 52:25.705
Well, I'll be damned!

52:38.505 --> 52:40.665
Unbelievable.

52:54.938 --> 52:57.599
Money?

52:57.772 --> 53:00.762
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

53:00.938 --> 53:06.565
- And this...
- Thank you.

53:06.738 --> 53:08.227
Thank you...

54:27.038 --> 54:30.563
Attention, people...

54:30.738 --> 54:34.569
This is a very special place.
Right behind here...

54:34.738 --> 54:38.569
I'm serious,
this is the Royal Palace.

54:38.738 --> 54:43.137
The former private quarters of
the king and queen is next door.

54:43.271 --> 54:46.761
And one person here tonight
has the keys...

54:48.371 --> 54:55.032
We thought we'd pop in
and have a look.

54:56.772 --> 54:59.500
Oh, crap! We have...

55:00.438 --> 55:01.681
Don't forget to be
extremely careful

55:01.705 --> 55:03.467
with the interiors.

55:32.638 --> 55:37.900
- Josefina!
- Come with us...

56:01.904 --> 56:03.701
Do you know this one?

56:13.371 --> 56:14.599
No.

56:31.737 --> 56:32.863
Do you want to sit?

56:33.004 --> 56:34.471
No, go ahead.

57:34.871 --> 57:36.929
Cunt!

57:42.938 --> 57:44.996
Shh! Cunt!

57:50.538 --> 57:52.834
Excuse me?

57:52.971 --> 57:55.200
Cunt.

57:55.371 --> 57:58.338
Did you say "cunt"?

57:58.505 --> 57:59.903
Shh!

58:00.071 --> 58:02.004
Cunt.

58:05.238 --> 58:06.761
Okay.

58:06.938 --> 58:08.180
Yeah, do you remember
from the...

58:08.204 --> 58:10.228
Shh!

58:12.038 --> 58:13.335
Um...

58:14.737 --> 58:16.863
- You want to go ahead?
- No.

58:43.505 --> 58:46.529
I am not going
to sleep with her tonight.

59:41.938 --> 59:45.030
Um... Ann?

59:47.804 --> 59:49.362
Anne.

01:00:24.971 --> 01:00:27.302
All right.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.997
I can take that, yeah.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.501
There.

01:01:49.637 --> 01:01:51.161
- It's on.
- Okay.

01:01:51.338 --> 01:01:52.736
Hmm?

01:03:40.437 --> 01:03:42.836
Did you come?

01:03:42.938 --> 01:03:45.996
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:47.933
Cool.

01:04:05.571 --> 01:04:07.538
I can take that.

01:04:08.871 --> 01:04:10.770
- What?
- I'll take it.

01:04:11.804 --> 01:04:13.236
No, it's fine. I got it.

01:04:13.404 --> 01:04:15.031
- Give it to me.
- No, it's cool.

01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:16.761
I'll...

01:04:16.938 --> 01:04:19.370
- I'll do it myself.
- Give it me, Christian.

01:04:23.871 --> 01:04:25.701
Um... no.

01:04:25.871 --> 01:04:28.861
No. I'll do it myself.

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:32.667
I'm going to the bathroom, so...

01:04:32.804 --> 01:04:35.396
I'll throw it out myself.
It's fine.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.731
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:04:56.704 --> 01:04:58.568
Throw it away.

01:05:12.637 --> 01:05:14.831
God, you really...

01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:19.063
Hmm. You really think highly
of yourself, don't you?

01:05:22.504 --> 01:05:23.732
No.

01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:28.202
I can't believe you think
I would do that.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:30.234
Do what?

01:05:31.237 --> 01:05:33.137
You know what I'm talking about.

01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:34.899
And what would that be?

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.099
You tell me.

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:38.847
- I'm not thinking anything.
- Yes, you are.

01:05:38.871 --> 01:05:40.633
- No! No.
- You're lying to me.

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.169
- I'm not lying.
- Yes, you are.

01:05:42.337 --> 01:05:44.327
"No, I'm not lying."
Yes, you are.

01:05:44.837 --> 01:05:47.066
- I'm not lying.
- Tell me. What do you think?

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.062
Oh, my God, you're being
all weird now.

01:05:49.203 --> 01:05:50.568
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

01:05:50.737 --> 01:05:53.169
The second we're done you're
going straight for the condom.

01:05:53.404 --> 01:05:55.166
- Trying to be nice.
- "Can I have it?"

01:05:55.337 --> 01:05:56.861
- What? Do you...
- Let go of it.

01:05:56.971 --> 01:05:58.232
- You let go.
- It's mine.

01:05:58.437 --> 01:06:00.495
It's not yours. Let go.

01:06:00.637 --> 01:06:01.535
- No.
- Yes,

01:06:01.637 --> 01:06:02.695
you're acting
like a child.

01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:04.201
- I'm not letting go.
- Let go!

01:06:04.337 --> 01:06:06.304
- No!
- I'm gonna let go if you don't.

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:07.835
- Let go then.
- You let go.

01:06:07.971 --> 01:06:09.631
- It's gonna break.
- Yes, it is.

01:06:09.737 --> 01:06:11.135
- Let go.
- Give it to me.

01:07:45.404 --> 01:07:46.404
Hello?

01:07:46.537 --> 01:07:48.504
<i>Hello,
is this Christian?</i>

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:50.035
Yeah.

01:07:50.203 --> 01:07:53.227
<i>This is the Central Station
7-Eleven.</i>

01:07:53.704 --> 01:07:56.068
<i>I'm calling to say that
there's a parcel here</i>

01:07:56.337 --> 01:07:58.201
<i>waiting for you.</i>

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:04.470
There must be
a misunderstanding,

01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:05.868
I picked it up yesterday.

01:08:07.037 --> 01:08:10.129
<i>This came just
a little while ago.</i>

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:11.869
<i>I'm holding it as we speak.</i>

01:08:12.604 --> 01:08:15.332
<i>It has "Christian" written
on it, so it has to be yours.</i>

01:08:15.537 --> 01:08:18.332
- And it was dropped off today?
<i>- Yes, today.</i>

01:08:20.604 --> 01:08:24.059
That's strange...
Could you open it for me?

01:08:24.737 --> 01:08:28.932
<i>- You want me to open it?</i>
- If that's possible, please do.

01:08:32.737 --> 01:08:34.761
<i>There's a little note inside.</i>

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.295
Is there a message?

01:08:37.437 --> 01:08:38.801
<i>Yes, want me
to read it to you?</i>

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:39.970
Yes, please.

01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:42.366
<i>"You accused me
of being a thief.</i>

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:44.867
<i>Apologize to me
and my family,</i>

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.193
<i>or I'll make chaos with you."</i>

01:08:51.537 --> 01:08:54.368
Oh, I'll be darned...
"Chaos," you said?

01:08:54.938 --> 01:08:59.337
<i>Yes."Or I'll make C-H-A-O-S
with you."</i>

01:08:59.504 --> 01:09:03.562
Uh-huh, yeah. Well, I'll
pick it up as soon as I can.

01:09:03.737 --> 01:09:07.328
<i>There's a phone number here
too, want me to say it?</i>

01:09:07.504 --> 01:09:11.993
No, never mind,
I'll come and get the parcel.

01:09:12.237 --> 01:09:15.033
- Thank you for calling.
<i>- Great, bye.</i>

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:23.738
Will you be wearing
your hair up?

01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:25.335
That's the plan.

01:09:30.237 --> 01:09:32.203
- Okay
- Is it time?

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.832
One, two, three...

01:09:41.103 --> 01:09:42.764
Yes!

01:09:47.937 --> 01:09:49.063
<i>What's up!</i>

01:09:49.504 --> 01:09:51.300
How are you feeling
about this?

01:09:51.404 --> 01:09:52.701
Great.

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.028
We're getting closer.

01:09:55.704 --> 01:09:58.466
I'm excited to hear what
you've come up with.

01:09:58.771 --> 01:10:02.465
- Right. Are you all set?
- Absolutely.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:07.026
- It's great to be back.
- Great to have you back.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:09.761
This project raises
many interesting,

01:10:10.103 --> 01:10:12.934
topical and
humanitarian issues.

01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:16.469
But the challenge here

01:10:16.737 --> 01:10:21.136
is to cut through
the media clutter.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:24.998
Your competition
isn't other museums,

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:27.831
it's disasters,
terrorism,

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.833
and controversial moves
by far-right politicians.

01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:34.229
Keep that at the back
of your mind, stay calm,

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:37.859
and Daniel will
tell you about our idea.

01:10:38.037 --> 01:10:39.595
Okay.

01:10:39.771 --> 01:10:41.203
Yes.

01:10:41.903 --> 01:10:45.200
Moving media,
that's what we recommend.

01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:48.399
When making films today,
you need to be aware

01:10:48.604 --> 01:10:51.594
that people have
a very short attention span.

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:56.830
If the viewer isn't hooked in
two seconds, they'll move on.

01:10:57.771 --> 01:11:01.828
In 10 to 15 seconds, tops,
we also have to create

01:11:01.937 --> 01:11:04.769
something so powerful
or interesting

01:11:04.937 --> 01:11:08.496
that people want to
share it on Facebook,

01:11:08.771 --> 01:11:11.862
social media, to the press,
thereby creating a viral effect.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.895
We conducted market research

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:20.504
on what's shared the most
on social media.

01:11:21.103 --> 01:11:23.366
It's generally
vulnerable groups.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:28.567
People post about women,
the disabled,

01:11:28.737 --> 01:11:33.897
the racialized, LGBTQ people...
You can make that list longer,

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.401
but there is one group
that affects people

01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:40.527
even more strongly: beggars.

01:11:40.704 --> 01:11:44.193
So we'd like to use a beggar
in this clip,

01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:48.303
but also turn it up a notch
by making the beggar a child.

01:11:50.504 --> 01:11:56.335
In addition to this,
the beggar will have fair hair.

01:11:56.504 --> 01:11:59.130
Personify the Swedish...

01:11:59.404 --> 01:12:01.428
What are you thinking...?

01:12:04.836 --> 01:12:10.827
We open on the Palace courtyard.
The Square is visible.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:14.996
So there's product placement
from frame one.

01:12:16.237 --> 01:12:18.067
Towards this artwork...

01:12:18.437 --> 01:12:21.029
is daybreak and the Square
is shimmering

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:23.931
with its promise of trust,

01:12:24.203 --> 01:12:28.660
caring, moral courage
and all that good stuff...

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:31.861
Then we see a little girl
approaching the Square.

01:12:32.037 --> 01:12:36.368
She's shivering.
She's all alone. She's crying.

01:12:36.537 --> 01:12:38.470
She's wrapped in a dirty blanket

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.400
and you sense
that she's homeless.

01:12:40.571 --> 01:12:44.163
These are powerful images
so we've hooked the viewer.

01:12:45.803 --> 01:12:47.395
The girl
keeps on walking...

01:12:51.604 --> 01:12:55.401
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, please go on.

01:12:58.437 --> 01:12:59.733
Powerful images...

01:12:59.937 --> 01:13:01.404
You wonder where it's
all heading.

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:03.996
She's crying
as she moves along...

01:13:08.736 --> 01:13:10.067
She enters the Square...

01:13:18.037 --> 01:13:20.731
And there,
it's time for the unexpected.

01:13:22.304 --> 01:13:25.567
The total opposite of everything
the Square stands for.

01:13:26.537 --> 01:13:31.402
The surprise effect will
generate the attention we need,

01:13:31.571 --> 01:13:36.799
creating the perfect platform
to express your message.

01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:40.469
All those values and issues
your exhibition

01:13:40.604 --> 01:13:42.571
would like to raise.

01:13:51.103 --> 01:13:52.831
- Hmm?
- Exciting...

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.403
And not at all
what I expected.

01:13:55.571 --> 01:13:57.901
- That's good.
- A novel approach.

01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:01.764
That's what we wanted
to achieve.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:06.530
So, what happens?

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:09.330
Exactly what happens?

01:14:09.937 --> 01:14:16.394
Well, we haven't quite figured
out exactly what that will be,

01:14:16.903 --> 01:14:19.734
but in one way or another,

01:14:19.903 --> 01:14:22.699
the girl will get hurt
inside the Square.

01:14:25.604 --> 01:14:28.503
What do you mean
by "get hurt"?

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:32.397
Well, it's the last thing
viewers expect,

01:14:32.571 --> 01:14:34.197
and opposite of...

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:37.360
- Hello.
- Great! Come on in.

01:14:37.537 --> 01:14:42.061
Michael, can I
bother you for a sec?

01:14:42.237 --> 01:14:44.897
Christian, it would
be great if you could join us.

01:14:45.237 --> 01:14:47.329
It would be great
if you could join us.

01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:52.734
Let's take it from the top.

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:54.994
He needs to be
on board with this.

01:14:55.736 --> 01:14:58.363
This looks fine.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:03.726
It's the right approach.
Go ahead, run with it.

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:05.303
I could
run through it...

01:15:05.404 --> 01:15:07.200
I've got to go.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:09.132
- Bye.
- But...

01:15:13.037 --> 01:15:16.834
Okay, we'll do a recap later.
Let's move on.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:19.301
Explain, please.

01:15:19.437 --> 01:15:21.370
What's happening here

01:15:21.504 --> 01:15:23.868
is exactly what we
want to achieve.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:27.762
Questions like these reflect

01:15:28.537 --> 01:15:31.731
how the general public
and the media will react.

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:33.028
That's what
I'm afraid of.

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:34.467
Don't be...

01:15:34.603 --> 01:15:38.764
Excuse me...
What's your name?

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:40.930
Hello...

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:43.132
- Yes, you.
- Nicki.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:44.861
Do you have
a drivers' license?

01:15:45.037 --> 01:15:45.867
Yes.

01:15:46.037 --> 01:15:47.334
Come along.

01:15:48.037 --> 01:15:50.470
- Right now?
- Yes. Please.

01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:59.397
We have, of course,

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:02.860
prepared for crisis management.

01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:05.394
That's part of our risk
analysis,

01:16:05.536 --> 01:16:09.594
to prepare for
any external concerns.

01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:12.532
The same concerns I sense here.

01:16:12.703 --> 01:16:14.727
We can handle them.

01:17:01.503 --> 01:17:04.834
Don't make me angry!
Don't act stupid!

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:07.335
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:08.696
It says "Christian" here.

01:17:08.803 --> 01:17:10.929
- And there.
- Yes, but...

01:17:11.103 --> 01:17:17.333
- Oh. Are you Christian?
- No, he's my boss.

01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:19.335
- Your boss?
- Listen...

01:17:19.436 --> 01:17:21.301
- Where's your stupid boss?
- Listen...

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:24.995
- Where's your stupid boss?
- Lower your voice.

01:17:25.636 --> 01:17:27.830
I've got nothing to do
with all this...

01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:31.698
- I want his phone number.
- You can't have it.

01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:36.327
Why not? Look what he did to me,
I need to talk to him.

01:17:36.503 --> 01:17:39.766
I'm really sorry,
we made a mistake.

01:17:39.937 --> 01:17:45.461
What? Why did you write this?
My parents think I'm a thief.

01:17:45.603 --> 01:17:49.661
They won't let me play ball,
or anything! All thanks to you!

01:17:49.803 --> 01:17:52.702
- Hey, listen...
- You put this in my letterbox.

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:56.167
It wasn't me, it was my boss.

01:17:56.337 --> 01:17:59.826
No, you did this!
You're lying. You're Christian.

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:03.994
- He's lying to me!
- Calm down.

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:06.602
Look what he put
in our letterbox!

01:18:07.503 --> 01:18:09.232
Now my parents think
I'm a thief.

01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.163
My boss was robbed...

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:14.759
All I get to do is stay home
and rot!

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:18.996
They took his phone
and his wallet...

01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:21.228
So he put a note
in all the letterboxes.

01:18:21.403 --> 01:18:24.700
- What are you laughing at?
- Well, it's...

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:27.201
- You bastard! Shut up.
- Chill...

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:32.393
- You can't fight in here.
- Look at what he wrote.

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.003
Don't I have the right
to be angry?

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:38.228
I don't know
who's right here.

01:18:38.403 --> 01:18:42.598
He's pretending
to have a boss called Christian.

01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:47.033
And he's pretending that he
can't understand my Swedish...

01:18:47.203 --> 01:18:51.533
Translate,
so the idiot understands.

01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:53.863
Stop calling me an idiot.

01:18:54.037 --> 01:18:56.061
- Give me his number!
- Shh! Calm down!

01:18:57.536 --> 01:19:01.300
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey! What are you doing?

01:19:03.536 --> 01:19:05.833
What's wrong with you?

01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:09.835
What do you expect me to do?
I didn't do this!

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:33.294
- Jesus!
- What the hell are you doing?

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.199
I'm so sorry.

01:19:35.369 --> 01:19:37.132
- You scared me.
- You scared me.

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:39.203
- Sorry...
- Christian?

01:19:39.369 --> 01:19:41.734
- God!
- I'm sorry, but...

01:19:41.903 --> 01:19:45.301
- This is not a good time.
- It's an emergency.

01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:47.528
- What?
- Excuse me. Sorry.

01:19:47.703 --> 01:19:51.568
- It's okay.
- All right...

01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:55.596
One of the cleaners
managed to sweep up

01:19:55.937 --> 01:19:58.699
parts of the Gijoni exhibit.

01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:03.169
- The piles don't look the same.
- Are you pulling my leg?

01:20:03.336 --> 01:20:06.326
- Hmm.
- Are the piles gone?

01:20:06.503 --> 01:20:08.868
No, but they don't
look the same.

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:14.198
And we found
a bag full of gravel.

01:20:14.369 --> 01:20:15.996
So I'll call
the insurance company.

01:20:16.237 --> 01:20:21.000
No, no! No, don't do that.

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:26.326
Where's the gravel?
The gravel that was swept away?

01:20:26.503 --> 01:20:28.732
In a bag? Great.

01:20:28.903 --> 01:20:32.734
And we have photos, don't we?

01:20:32.903 --> 01:20:35.836
- Um-hm.
- So here's the plan:

01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:40.994
Meet me downstairs in 5 minutes,
with the photos and the gravel,

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:45.330
and we'll fix it.
Without telling anyone at all.

01:20:45.503 --> 01:20:47.993
She doesn't understand a thing,
she's American.

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:51.194
Are you serious?
We're going to fix the piles?

01:20:51.369 --> 01:20:54.530
Sure, it will be fine. Hm?

01:20:54.703 --> 01:20:56.670
We'll sort it out.

01:20:58.037 --> 01:20:59.731
- Okay.
- Mm-hm?

01:20:59.903 --> 01:21:04.064
Mm-hm. Yeah. Okay.

01:21:11.703 --> 01:21:14.898
Do you remember what happened
between us the other night?

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.070
We were here.

01:21:16.202 --> 01:21:18.533
Yeah, no, after that though.

01:21:18.703 --> 01:21:21.693
- We left.
- Yes. And then?

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.666
- We got in a car.
- Mm-hm.

01:21:25.236 --> 01:21:27.567
Went back to your place.

01:21:32.202 --> 01:21:33.635
No?

01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:36.933
- Missing something?
- Mm-mm.

01:21:38.269 --> 01:21:40.293
You opened a bottle of wine,
we sat down.

01:21:40.436 --> 01:21:42.528
We talked, had a great time.

01:21:42.703 --> 01:21:44.533
And then what happened?

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.436
Are you getting at something
specific here?

01:21:50.603 --> 01:21:51.843
- Yes.
- You've got something...

01:21:51.903 --> 01:21:52.903
Very specific.

01:21:52.937 --> 01:21:54.379
Why don't you just come out
and say it?

01:21:54.403 --> 01:21:55.563
Because I want you to say it.

01:21:55.636 --> 01:21:57.126
I want you to remember it.

01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:04.963
Why is it so hard
for you to say...

01:22:05.137 --> 01:22:06.626
Come.

01:22:08.736 --> 01:22:10.362
Why is it so...

01:22:10.536 --> 01:22:12.935
I don't understand why it's
so hard for you to say this.

01:22:13.103 --> 01:22:16.661
- We had sex.
- Great, yes.

01:22:16.803 --> 01:22:18.497
Why didn't you just
say it yourself?

01:22:18.636 --> 01:22:20.193
You didn't want to say it.

01:22:33.236 --> 01:22:36.169
Okay, you were inside of me,
that's what happened.

01:22:36.336 --> 01:22:38.735
- Yes, I am...
- You were inside of me.

01:22:38.903 --> 01:22:41.335
- I'm aware of that.
- Okay, good.

01:22:41.503 --> 01:22:42.902
You remember that then.

01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:45.832
Listen, that is part of it.

01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:47.664
Yes, it's a big part of it.

01:22:47.803 --> 01:22:49.997
When a man and a woman,
you know...

01:22:50.169 --> 01:22:51.466
The man is...

01:22:51.603 --> 01:22:53.399
- Good.
- Inside the woman, yeah?

01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:56.765
And that meant something,
did it not?

01:22:56.937 --> 01:22:58.369
Absolutely.

01:22:58.536 --> 01:23:00.833
Okay. What did it mean to you?

01:23:06.937 --> 01:23:08.597
I really enjoyed myself
that evening.

01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.737
- I did. I absolutely did.
- Good, good, and I...

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.563
Can you please keep
your voice down?

01:23:13.736 --> 01:23:16.328
It's just there's someone
right over there.

01:23:16.503 --> 01:23:19.299
- Yeah, yeah. I like you.
- Mm-hm.

01:23:19.436 --> 01:23:22.232
And I have an emotional
connection to you,

01:23:22.403 --> 01:23:25.893
and I'd like to explore that
because it's important to me.

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:28.265
I don't just go have sex
with anybody.

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.064
You know? I have to have that.

01:23:30.803 --> 01:23:32.770
Do you just go have sex
with just anybody?

01:23:33.037 --> 01:23:34.230
Excuse me?

01:23:34.403 --> 01:23:37.199
Do you just go have sex
with lots of other women?

01:23:38.202 --> 01:23:40.226
Um...

01:23:42.603 --> 01:23:44.900
Is this something
that you do a lot?

01:23:47.336 --> 01:23:49.360
Kind of a private question,
isn't it?

01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:53.503
Uh, well, so it being inside me
pretty private, so...

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.967
But where's
the connection there?

01:23:56.202 --> 01:23:57.829
I'm asking how often
you do this.

01:24:09.202 --> 01:24:12.829
How... how often would you say
that you take women...

01:24:13.803 --> 01:24:15.531
that you don't know very well,

01:24:15.836 --> 01:24:17.735
and have sex with them
and be inside them?

01:24:18.069 --> 01:24:19.400
I'm not sure...

01:24:19.903 --> 01:24:21.335
Do you not remember them?

01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:23.793
Yeah, sure, I do. Yeah.

01:24:24.069 --> 01:24:25.866
You know their names?

01:24:26.736 --> 01:24:28.168
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:24:28.336 --> 01:24:29.633
- Mm-hm, yeah.
- Always?

01:24:29.836 --> 01:24:31.268
- Always. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:33.161
So what's my name?

01:24:44.336 --> 01:24:45.359
I know your name.

01:24:45.536 --> 01:24:47.127
Okay, then good, what is it?

01:24:47.269 --> 01:24:49.293
I'm not gonna go
into this with you.

01:24:49.436 --> 01:24:50.596
This is stupid.

01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:52.361
Anyone that would know
somebody's name

01:24:52.536 --> 01:24:56.196
would just say, "Of course
I know your name."

01:24:56.369 --> 01:24:57.563
Name.

01:24:57.736 --> 01:25:00.293
- I know your name.
- What is it?

01:25:02.403 --> 01:25:03.927
Anne.

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:09.536
Okay.

01:25:11.436 --> 01:25:13.130
You really
piss me off.

01:25:13.269 --> 01:25:14.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:15.036 --> 01:25:16.663
I think you're fascinating.

01:25:16.803 --> 01:25:18.770
Oh, now we're gonna
get to the... oh.

01:25:18.937 --> 01:25:21.199
Yeah, I think you're
so interesting.

01:25:21.369 --> 01:25:24.393
Yes, I really do. I'm really
starting to figure you out.

01:25:24.570 --> 01:25:26.537
- You are?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:26.636 --> 01:25:27.636
Let's hear it.

01:25:27.736 --> 01:25:31.464
I think you're interested
in using your position,

01:25:31.636 --> 01:25:33.466
which is a position of power,

01:25:33.603 --> 01:25:36.832
to attract women
and to make conquests.

01:25:36.969 --> 01:25:38.903
That's what I think.

01:25:39.069 --> 01:25:41.036
That's what I think. Sorry.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:44.535
Mm-hm. Is that how I
got you into bed?

01:25:44.703 --> 01:25:46.533
Well, it didn't work for me
in that way.

01:25:46.703 --> 01:25:49.602
- Oh, no. Absolutely not.
- Well, you admit it now.

01:25:50.169 --> 01:25:51.192
It didn't work for you.

01:25:51.336 --> 01:25:53.064
That's not a turn-on for you
in any way.

01:25:53.936 --> 01:25:56.062
It's a lot of things,
but I don't think it's...

01:25:56.336 --> 01:25:58.769
It's nothing to do with
the fact that I'm...

01:25:59.102 --> 01:26:00.831
I... I don't think so.

01:26:00.969 --> 01:26:05.335
Why is that so hard to admit,
that power is a turn-on?

01:26:05.770 --> 01:26:07.862
- Admit it.
- But it's not true for me.

01:26:08.036 --> 01:26:09.367
- It's not true. Okay.
- No.

01:26:09.536 --> 01:26:11.526
I'll admit to something else
as well.

01:26:11.703 --> 01:26:13.192
I'm really proud
that I conquered you.

01:26:13.369 --> 01:26:14.734
- Are you?
- Yeah.

01:26:15.969 --> 01:26:17.993
- Proud of having me.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.202
You. You're quite a catch...

01:26:22.102 --> 01:26:24.069
Yeah. Huh?

01:26:24.469 --> 01:26:26.459
You're quite a catch.

01:26:38.036 --> 01:26:40.230
"You accused me
of being a thief.

01:26:40.403 --> 01:26:42.029
You will apologize to me
and my family,

01:26:42.202 --> 01:26:46.158
or I will make chaos with you."

01:28:37.102 --> 01:28:38.729
Hello?

01:28:42.636 --> 01:28:44.125
Hello.

01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:49.169
Daddy!

01:28:49.236 --> 01:28:50.827
Why didn't you
open the door?

01:28:50.969 --> 01:28:53.061
And why didn't you
pick us up!

01:28:53.236 --> 01:28:54.726
It wasn't
my turn to do it.

01:28:54.902 --> 01:28:58.666
- We had to call Mummy!
- She didn't tell me...

01:28:58.802 --> 01:29:01.860
- Go inside, you idiot!
- Stop it!

01:29:04.603 --> 01:29:07.035
No... What's going on here?

01:29:07.202 --> 01:29:13.295
What's wrong?
Don't fight like that...

01:29:13.436 --> 01:29:17.062
What's wrong with you?

01:29:17.236 --> 01:29:20.032
- You twerp!
- I hate you!

01:29:20.202 --> 01:29:22.896
- Let go!
- Stop it!

01:29:24.802 --> 01:29:26.769
Hey, hey...!

01:29:28.369 --> 01:29:32.859
What are you doing?
No, go to your room.

01:29:33.036 --> 01:29:35.299
What's the matter, Lise? No!

01:29:37.902 --> 01:29:41.858
Lilly? What have I said
about slamming doors?

01:29:42.036 --> 01:29:44.594
What have I said
about that?!

01:29:48.536 --> 01:29:52.526
What have I said
about slamming doors?

01:29:52.702 --> 01:29:59.466
We've talked about this.
What's wrong with you two?

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:04.298
Lise? You're the eldest...
What's all this?

01:30:11.169 --> 01:30:12.329
Hello?

01:30:41.802 --> 01:30:43.928
Why are you fighting like this?

01:30:46.236 --> 01:30:48.032
What's the matter?

01:31:08.436 --> 01:31:11.994
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- No, it was my fault.

01:31:12.269 --> 01:31:15.134
I raised my voice.

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:17.599
I shouldn't have
shouted like that.

01:31:18.635 --> 01:31:21.727
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

01:31:24.202 --> 01:31:29.226
Do you want to wait here
while I go get Lise? All right?

01:31:41.336 --> 01:31:46.598
Welcome! I'm delighted
to see such a crowd.

01:31:46.936 --> 01:31:49.926
Here are sets for our new
exhibition,

01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:53.298
one that is
very promising indeed.

01:31:55.802 --> 01:32:02.134
To enter, you have to decide
whether you trust other people,

01:32:02.269 --> 01:32:06.759
or that you don't,
you mistrust them.

01:32:06.936 --> 01:32:11.336
This is done by pressing
the appropriate button.

01:32:11.503 --> 01:32:14.493
You're welcome to do that now.

01:32:30.702 --> 01:32:34.829
Excited?
Let's see what happens next.

01:32:45.735 --> 01:32:49.499
- Should we?
- What do you think?

01:32:49.635 --> 01:32:54.399
- That's what it says.
- So, shouldn't we?

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:57.036
- Here?
- Mm-hm.

01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:03.693
Is that okay?
Does it feel strange?

01:33:03.869 --> 01:33:06.166
Yes.

01:33:08.403 --> 01:33:10.596
It'll be interesting to see
if they're still there

01:33:10.769 --> 01:33:13.168
when we get back.

01:33:13.336 --> 01:33:17.463
This reminds me of something
your grandpa told me.

01:33:17.602 --> 01:33:21.899
He was a boy, about 6 years old.

01:33:22.069 --> 01:33:24.366
And he was about to go out
and play...

01:33:24.535 --> 01:33:26.559
His parents made him a tag

01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:30.136
and wrote his name and address
on it.

01:33:30.269 --> 01:33:33.861
They hung it around his neck
and sent him off to play

01:33:34.036 --> 01:33:37.162
all by himself
in the middle of Copenhagen.

01:33:37.336 --> 01:33:43.236
Imagine if I had done that
to you when you were six.

01:33:43.403 --> 01:33:47.699
That never would have happened.
Attitudes change...

01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:52.461
Back then,
people trusted other grownups

01:33:52.702 --> 01:33:54.862
to help their children if they

01:33:54.969 --> 01:33:57.334
had problems or had
lost their way.

01:33:57.902 --> 01:34:00.664
But nowadays, you tend to
regard other adults

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:04.735
as potential threats.

01:34:06.502 --> 01:34:07.502
Do you understand?

01:34:07.535 --> 01:34:09.332
What's that got to do
with this?

01:34:09.569 --> 01:34:13.333
Everything. Read this again
and you'll understand.

01:34:14.602 --> 01:34:17.660
Read it again. Out loud.

01:34:18.202 --> 01:34:24.897
"The Square is
a sanctuary of trust and caring.

01:34:25.269 --> 01:34:32.032
Within it, we all share
equal rights and obligations."

01:34:44.036 --> 01:34:49.867
I don't have any cash.
Sorry, I don't have any cash.

01:34:50.969 --> 01:34:52.993
I don't have any cash.

01:35:32.102 --> 01:35:33.102
Hello?

01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:37.568

Really? Well, that's nice.

01:36:00.869 --> 01:36:05.235
I presume you're referring
to our artist talk.

<i>No, it's "Blonde Child Beggar

01:36:11.335 --> 01:36:13.666
<i>The reason I'm calling
is to ask</i>

01:36:13.802 --> 01:36:15.769
<i>if you are interested
in any ads,</i>

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:20.665
<i>thereby sharing
partner revenue.</i>

01:36:22.702 --> 01:36:23.702
<i>Hello?</i>

01:36:23.869 --> 01:36:27.825
I need to get my head
around this...

01:36:28.036 --> 01:36:31.867
We have a clip on YouTube

01:36:32.236 --> 01:36:34.226
that features kids
being blown up?

01:36:34.402 --> 01:36:39.029
<i>I haven't seen
the clip myself...</i>

01:36:39.202 --> 01:36:40.930
<i>I don't work with content.</i>

01:36:41.102 --> 01:36:44.660
No, of course not.
Listen, can I call you back

01:36:44.802 --> 01:36:48.894
in ten minutes
when I know more about this?

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:54.525
<i>- Sure.</i>
- I'll do that. Great. Bye.

01:37:07.535 --> 01:37:11.128
This so can't be happening.

01:37:12.936 --> 01:37:15.368
Unbelievable...

01:37:58.569 --> 01:38:00.661
Excuse me,
could you help me?

01:38:00.802 --> 01:38:03.701
No?

01:38:03.869 --> 01:38:08.393
- Could you give me a hand?
- Sorry...

01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:14.998
Excuse me.

01:38:15.635 --> 01:38:17.659
Hi. Can you...

01:38:17.802 --> 01:38:19.735
Hey, hey. I need your help.

01:38:19.902 --> 01:38:21.926
Can you help me, please.

01:38:23.702 --> 01:38:25.828
Can you please help me.

01:38:27.802 --> 01:38:30.394
Yes, you.
Can you help me, please.

01:38:33.168 --> 01:38:34.294
Can you please come with me.

01:38:34.602 --> 01:38:36.126
Please come.

01:38:36.268 --> 01:38:38.826
Come. Come. Come on.

01:38:38.969 --> 01:38:40.936
I need help.

01:38:41.102 --> 01:38:42.227
Thank you.

01:38:42.402 --> 01:38:44.063
Just...

01:38:44.235 --> 01:38:47.168
Um, and just wait.

01:38:47.335 --> 01:38:48.597
Just wait here.

01:38:48.769 --> 01:38:50.929
My daughters are missing.

01:38:51.102 --> 01:38:52.864
So I'm gonna go look for them.

01:38:53.036 --> 01:38:54.468
If they come back here,

01:38:54.602 --> 01:38:57.330
please tell them
that I will be right back.

01:38:57.502 --> 01:38:59.731
And just watch... the bags.

01:38:59.902 --> 01:39:01.869
And my daughters,
if they come,

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:03.556
tell them I'll be here
in five minutes.

01:39:03.702 --> 01:39:06.464
Yeah. Thank you.

01:40:11.869 --> 01:40:14.358
"These people must die in hell.

01:40:14.535 --> 01:40:17.297
If I meet them on the street, I
will punch them in their faces."

01:40:17.435 --> 01:40:21.527
"You make money off of
scaring people shitless."

01:40:25.368 --> 01:40:28.563
"Why aren't these people dead?"

01:40:29.368 --> 01:40:30.699
- Well,
- He's here.

01:40:30.802 --> 01:40:34.394
at least
we got people talking.

01:40:52.735 --> 01:40:56.634
<i>...have produced this
video with taxpayers' money...</i>

01:40:56.802 --> 01:40:58.428
Hello...

01:41:00.335 --> 01:41:01.962
Hi, Elna.

01:41:02.869 --> 01:41:03.949
<i>And the other thing
they do,</i>

01:41:04.068 --> 01:41:06.126
<i>that they are
clueless about,</i>

01:41:06.435 --> 01:41:08.698
<i>is to attack one of Sweden's</i>

01:41:08.902 --> 01:41:10.892
<i>most vulnerable groups,
the beggars.</i>

01:41:11.068 --> 01:41:15.729
<i>People who sit day
and night outside shops.</i>

01:41:16.502 --> 01:41:20.697
<i>A video like this is pissing
them straight in the face.</i>

01:41:20.869 --> 01:41:23.734
<i>What's really sick is that
my 6-year-old daughter...</i>

01:41:23.902 --> 01:41:27.596
- Could you turn that off?
<i>- ...sees body parts flying...</i>

01:41:27.769 --> 01:41:30.736
Who's that idiot?

01:41:31.268 --> 01:41:35.463
Elna, this is an opportunity
to take a stand.

01:41:35.602 --> 01:41:39.501
We, as a museum, mustn't
be afraid to push boundaries.

01:41:39.635 --> 01:41:44.193
To transcend
all kinds of taboos.

01:41:44.368 --> 01:41:47.494
Nothing should stand in the way
of freedom of expression.

01:41:47.635 --> 01:41:51.500
That's my conviction.
It's something to stand up for.

01:41:53.569 --> 01:41:54.695
Without a doubt.

01:42:01.402 --> 01:42:03.392
BabyBjörn...

01:42:03.569 --> 01:42:06.832
Do you think they'll want
to donate money to this museum?

01:42:11.235 --> 01:42:13.202
You do realize

01:42:13.368 --> 01:42:15.460
that I didn't have anything
to do with this video?

01:42:15.602 --> 01:42:21.331
- I didn't make it...
- That's totally irrelevant.

01:42:21.502 --> 01:42:23.230
Really.

01:42:27.535 --> 01:42:31.059
I have a board meeting
to attend.

01:42:31.235 --> 01:42:33.225
And I want to make sure
that you will comply

01:42:33.402 --> 01:42:36.233
with any decisions we make.

01:42:36.402 --> 01:42:42.063
Well, that depends
on what we're talking about.

01:42:42.235 --> 01:42:46.692
That would be decisions related
to the consequences of all this.

01:42:51.902 --> 01:42:55.062
- Obviously.
- Okay.

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:57.065
Good.

01:43:12.502 --> 01:43:15.560
Girls, if you want to draw,

01:43:15.735 --> 01:43:18.861
there are some crayons
over there.

01:43:19.035 --> 01:43:23.560
- No...
- You don't want to? Why not?

01:43:26.502 --> 01:43:30.458
One more thing.
We need new press photos of you.

01:43:32.901 --> 01:43:33.901
What for?

01:43:33.968 --> 01:43:35.731
On the ones we have,
you're smiling.

01:43:49.435 --> 01:43:51.026
Welcome.

01:43:52.935 --> 01:43:54.493
Christian?

01:43:58.268 --> 01:44:01.724
Keep in mind that they
don't know about the clip.

01:44:42.968 --> 01:44:45.299
<i>I'm
asking for your utmost caution</i>

01:44:45.435 --> 01:44:47.368
<i>during this performance.</i>

01:44:55.368 --> 01:44:59.529
- What's happening?
- This will be exciting!

01:44:59.702 --> 01:45:01.396
<i>Welcome to the jungle.</i>

01:45:04.168 --> 01:45:08.693
<i>Soon you will be confronted
by a wild animal.</i>

01:45:08.868 --> 01:45:11.028
<i>As you all know,
the hunting instinct</i>

01:45:11.201 --> 01:45:13.225
<i>is triggered by weakness.</i>

01:45:13.402 --> 01:45:17.130
<i>If you show fear,
the animal will sense it.</i>

01:45:19.768 --> 01:45:25.703
<i>If you try to escape,
the animal will hunt you down.</i>

01:45:28.535 --> 01:45:31.990
<i>But if you remain
perfectly still,</i>

01:45:32.168 --> 01:45:35.294
<i>without moving a muscle,</i>

01:45:35.435 --> 01:45:38.231
<i>the animal
might not notice you.</i>

01:45:38.402 --> 01:45:41.164
<i>And you can hide in the herd,</i>

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:45.598
<i>safe in the knowledge that
someone else will be the prey.</i>

01:46:07.935 --> 01:46:10.198
What's going on?

01:48:10.435 --> 01:48:12.992
- This is rather fierce.
- Yes.

01:49:29.935 --> 01:49:31.697
Hello.

01:49:41.901 --> 01:49:43.765
Stop.

01:49:43.935 --> 01:49:46.232
Stop.

01:49:53.168 --> 01:49:54.828
Very funny.

01:50:15.168 --> 01:50:16.930
Go on, go away.

01:50:18.634 --> 01:50:19.692
Go away.

01:50:35.168 --> 01:50:37.828
Come on.

01:50:40.568 --> 01:50:43.763
Okay...

01:51:21.201 --> 01:51:26.600
Let's have a round of
applause... for Oleg Rogozjin.

01:51:26.768 --> 01:51:29.530
Amazing!

01:51:29.701 --> 01:51:33.600
Great! Thank you very much.

01:51:39.534 --> 01:51:41.831
Oleg, I just said that...

01:51:41.968 --> 01:51:44.491
I'm just saying that...

01:51:46.534 --> 01:51:48.865
I'm just saying...

01:52:24.734 --> 01:52:27.724
No.

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:37.231
Help...

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.929
Hey...

01:54:54.068 --> 01:54:57.058
That hurts a bit...

01:54:57.234 --> 01:55:00.360
Hello? Help...

01:55:00.534 --> 01:55:03.729
Fredrik, could you help me?

01:55:05.401 --> 01:55:08.300
Okay... Help!

01:55:24.568 --> 01:55:27.729
Stop it! Hey! Stop it!

01:55:39.534 --> 01:55:41.831
You bastard!

01:55:45.035 --> 01:55:47.160
Kill him, for God's sake!

01:56:37.401 --> 01:56:39.334
Are you Christian?

01:56:43.267 --> 01:56:46.234
Are you Christian?

01:56:46.401 --> 01:56:48.334
Daddy?

01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:52.867
Why don't you go upstairs?
This won't take long.

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.929
You can wait outside.

01:56:58.035 --> 01:57:02.297
- What are you doing here?
- You put this in our letterbox.

01:57:02.434 --> 01:57:06.333
- My parents think I'm a thief.
- You shouldn't be here.

01:57:06.501 --> 01:57:09.662
Yes, I should.
And you should apologize.

01:57:09.801 --> 01:57:14.234
Listen to me,
you shouldn't be here.

01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:17.334
This is just weird.
You have to leave.

01:57:17.501 --> 01:57:21.764
- Stay here. Hey!
- No.

01:57:22.901 --> 01:57:24.561
Hey...

01:57:25.901 --> 01:57:27.026
Hey, stop!

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.861
Don't shout,
people are sleeping.

01:57:31.601 --> 01:57:33.659
If you apologize, I'll go.

01:57:33.868 --> 01:57:37.198
Listen carefully to me...

01:57:39.034 --> 01:57:42.297
I'm really sorry
if my letter caused you trouble.

01:57:42.601 --> 01:57:49.023
This has nothing to do with you.
Please, let me finish...

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:52.031
It was nothing personal.

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:56.224
All I wanted was to
get my stuff back.

01:57:56.401 --> 01:58:00.926
- What are you doing?
- Good night. Go now.

01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.727
Stop!

01:58:05.901 --> 01:58:07.697
Hey! Stop!

01:58:09.334 --> 01:58:14.290
What are you doing?
Beat it!

01:58:20.067 --> 01:58:22.296
- Hey!
- Stop this.

01:58:22.434 --> 01:58:25.833
No. Apologize to me
and my family!

01:58:25.967 --> 01:58:31.060
Stop shouting!
Stop this and get out!

01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:37.056
I will smack you one,
believe me.

01:58:37.234 --> 01:58:41.759
I'm counting to three.
One, two...

01:58:41.935 --> 01:58:43.299
Get out.

01:58:47.568 --> 01:58:48.865
Get out!

01:59:11.434 --> 01:59:13.663
Let's go inside.

01:59:20.401 --> 01:59:24.459
What are you doing?
Don't do that!

01:59:30.768 --> 01:59:32.927
Stop doing that!

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.397
Stop it!

01:59:34.568 --> 01:59:37.000
You called me a thief,
so I'm making chaos with you!

01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.294
Stop this...

01:59:41.434 --> 01:59:44.889
No! Don't you...

01:59:46.934 --> 01:59:50.766
- They're my neighbors! Get out!
- Help me!

01:59:50.934 --> 01:59:54.493
- Hello? Hello?
- Beat it!

02:00:05.734 --> 02:00:08.030
Why didn't you listen to me?

02:00:10.267 --> 02:00:12.825
You should have listened.

02:00:12.967 --> 02:00:16.833
Right? Now go home.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.992
Go home.

02:00:31.501 --> 02:00:35.662
All right, go
and brush your teeth.

02:00:35.801 --> 02:00:39.858
Go on, brush your teeth...
Shoes off first.

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:20.597
Help!

02:01:37.434 --> 02:01:39.367
Help!

02:01:39.534 --> 02:01:42.864
- Hello?
- Help me...

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:45.062
Is there anyone here?

02:01:51.501 --> 02:01:53.058
Hello?

02:02:20.867 --> 02:02:22.766
Help!

02:02:26.867 --> 02:02:29.766
Here we go... Yes.

02:03:01.334 --> 02:03:03.891
Help me!

02:03:06.733 --> 02:03:08.394
Help!

02:03:13.733 --> 02:03:15.496
Help me...

02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:22.333
Help!

02:03:31.967 --> 02:03:33.661
Help me...

02:03:38.234 --> 02:03:39.928
Help...

02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:57.729
<i>The person
you're trying to reach</i>

02:06:57.900 --> 02:06:59.333
<i>is not available...</i>

02:07:22.767 --> 02:07:25.030
Uh, hi...

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:28.530
You can probably
see who this is.

02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:31.895
We just met on my stairwell.

02:07:32.067 --> 02:07:35.465
I tried to call,
but I couldn't get through.

02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:40.499
So now I'm making
this video instead.

02:07:40.633 --> 02:07:43.930
Because you're absolutely right.

02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:47.033
I apologize for
the rotten thing I did.

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.496
I accused you
of being a thief.

02:07:49.633 --> 02:07:54.329
Please show this
to your parents,

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.865
so they'll know you are
not a thief.

02:07:57.034 --> 02:08:00.126
The note said you stole
my phone and my wallet,

02:08:00.267 --> 02:08:03.200
but that wasn't true.

02:08:03.367 --> 02:08:07.390
I want to emphasize
that this is simply not true.

02:08:07.567 --> 02:08:11.023
So I'd like to apologize.
It was a bad thing to do.

02:08:15.433 --> 02:08:18.559
It was so selfish of me.

02:08:18.733 --> 02:08:21.723
Careless and prejudiced
and I'm...

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:27.061
Looking back, I should have
gone into your building,

02:08:27.234 --> 02:08:31.133
knocked on the doors
and asked a simple question.

02:08:31.267 --> 02:08:34.495
But that never
occurred to me, because...

02:08:36.167 --> 02:08:38.998
Well, honestly,
I was too afraid.

02:08:39.167 --> 02:08:42.861
Afraid of the people who live...

02:08:43.034 --> 02:08:47.229
Afraid of the people I picture
living in a building like yours.

02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:53.827
Those negative expectations
say something about me.

02:08:53.967 --> 02:08:56.763
They say something
about our society,

02:08:56.934 --> 02:09:01.993
because I'm sure I'm not
the only one who's prejudiced...

02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:07.531
You have preconceptions
about us too,

02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:10.462
probably because
our lives are so different.

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.396
So suddenly,
it comes down to politics

02:09:13.567 --> 02:09:16.659
and the distribution of assets.

02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:23.030
Because these problems can't
be solved by individuals alone.

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:27.758
Society needs to lend a hand
too. It's not enough

02:09:27.934 --> 02:09:33.993
that I admit I was wrong
and apologize to you in a video.

02:09:34.167 --> 02:09:37.361
There are bigger,
structural problems

02:09:37.533 --> 02:09:40.329
involved that society
needs to deal with.

02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:46.730
I actually know
one of the 291 people

02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:49.992
who own more than 50%
of the world's wealth.

02:09:50.167 --> 02:09:56.067
A guy like that could fix
all this in an instant.

02:10:20.967 --> 02:10:22.558
<i>Hi, you've
called Christian.</i>

02:10:22.733 --> 02:10:24.723
<i>I can't pick up my phone
right now,</i>

02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:28.492
<i>but please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

02:10:32.234 --> 02:10:33.860
Welcome...

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.161
We have...

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.530
We have called
this press conference

02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:56.759
in response to a certain video
circulating on the Internet.

02:10:56.934 --> 02:11:01.560
We believe that it's the best
way to deal with your questions.

02:11:01.733 --> 02:11:05.132
This session will be led by
our chief curator,

02:11:05.266 --> 02:11:06.756
Christian Juel Nielsen.

02:11:14.266 --> 02:11:15.927
Hello.

02:11:17.867 --> 02:11:22.232
Well, as previously stated...

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:26.731
We are here
to discuss the video clip

02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:33.356
published on the museum website
and on our YouTube channel.

02:11:33.533 --> 02:11:37.023
We have received a massive
amount of messages

02:11:37.199 --> 02:11:39.325
and indignant responses

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:43.558
with regard to this video,
and this pains us.

02:11:43.733 --> 02:11:48.564
- Could you please speak up?
- Yes, certainly.

02:11:48.733 --> 02:11:52.860
We're very sorry
to have caused this commotion,

02:11:53.034 --> 02:11:59.456
particularly since this clip
was published by mistake.

02:12:01.233 --> 02:12:03.757
This museum has
clearly defined procedures.

02:12:03.934 --> 02:12:07.196
It's my role to supervise
all our communications

02:12:07.366 --> 02:12:10.356
and marketing efforts.

02:12:10.533 --> 02:12:14.694
In this particular case, I did
not fully comply with protocol,

02:12:14.867 --> 02:12:19.891
and this video was published
without my knowledge.

02:12:20.067 --> 02:12:23.659
I have acted
irresponsibly in this matter,

02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:27.927
and have therefore,
in accord with our board,

02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:30.657
decided to step down.

02:12:31.166 --> 02:12:33.066
Are you saying that
you're resigning?

02:12:33.266 --> 02:12:34.324
Yes.

02:12:34.433 --> 02:12:37.229
- When?
- As soon as possible.

02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:38.826
Were you sacked?

02:12:38.934 --> 02:12:41.594
No, it was
a unanimous decision.

02:12:41.767 --> 02:12:46.826
We felt that it would be
the best solution.

02:12:46.967 --> 02:12:49.297
Define "we".

02:12:49.867 --> 02:12:52.732
That would be myself,
our management and our board.

02:12:53.099 --> 02:12:57.556
Where is your solidarity
with the voiceless

02:12:57.733 --> 02:13:00.894
and the vulnerable
members of society?

02:13:07.934 --> 02:13:12.560
Where is your solidarity
with the voiceless

02:13:12.733 --> 02:13:15.461
and the vulnerable
members of society?

02:13:18.433 --> 02:13:20.991
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

02:13:24.567 --> 02:13:26.557
That's total bullshit...

02:13:26.733 --> 02:13:33.189
You started out by saying
that you and the museum board

02:13:33.366 --> 02:13:37.595
agreed that you should resign.

02:13:37.767 --> 02:13:41.165
Yes, that was our decision.

02:13:41.333 --> 02:13:45.357
This is not the image
we wish to project.

02:13:45.533 --> 02:13:49.489
So you've reached the limit
for how much freedom of speech

02:13:49.633 --> 02:13:51.327
you can handle?

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:55.866
You've hit the ceiling
in terms of communication?

02:13:56.034 --> 02:13:59.865
Do you personally believe
that you crossed a line?

02:14:02.767 --> 02:14:06.894
I believe that freedom of speech

02:14:07.066 --> 02:14:08.658
comes with certain
responsibilities.

02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:11.665
You must consider
what you express.

02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.323
But is it up to you
to limit free speech?

02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:21.229
Isn't such self-censorship
cause for concern?

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:27.231
- You're in a powerful position.
- The decision was not all mine.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.299
But you took part
in this decision.

02:14:30.433 --> 02:14:33.229
You have clearly expressed
that this clip

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:38.993
was so distasteful that you
feel obligated to resign.

02:14:39.166 --> 02:14:43.463
I made a mistake, the clip was
published without my approval.

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.659
So that's where you draw the
line? A fictional girl gets...

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:52.289
No, it isn't. Like I said,
this has nothing to do

02:14:52.433 --> 02:14:54.491
with my own opinions.

02:14:54.633 --> 02:14:56.657
You're putting a cap
on free speech!

02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.767
These are not
my personal opinions.

02:14:58.934 --> 02:15:03.458
We're talking about the museum
and my professional role.

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.294
What is it you don't
understand about that?

02:15:06.433 --> 02:15:10.298
This is a highly alarming future

02:15:10.433 --> 02:15:14.890
you're creating for our society.

02:15:15.066 --> 02:15:17.226
Quite frankly, it sucks!

02:15:28.066 --> 02:15:31.727
Christian... Christian?

02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:36.060
I have questions
about the content of the clip.

02:15:39.567 --> 02:15:45.125
How did the choice fall on
a blonde beggar girl exploding?

02:15:45.266 --> 02:15:47.926
This just came
from the PR agency.

02:15:48.099 --> 02:15:51.897
If you wanted to draw parallels
to the poverty in the EU,

02:15:52.066 --> 02:15:54.533
why not have
a dark-haired child?

02:15:58.633 --> 02:16:01.862
How do you respond to that?

02:16:02.033 --> 02:16:05.467
As I was trying to explain,

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.761
I have not dealt responsibly...

02:16:08.933 --> 02:16:13.663
- Answer the question!
- I just received a message...

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.925
...that might shed
some light on this.

02:16:16.099 --> 02:16:19.828
I hope so.

02:16:19.966 --> 02:16:23.730
It's a statement from
our marketing department

02:16:23.899 --> 02:16:27.856
and the agency we used.

02:16:28.033 --> 02:16:31.364
"We want to emphasize
that the clip

02:16:31.533 --> 02:16:35.296
published on the museum's
website and YouTube channel

02:16:35.433 --> 02:16:41.162
in no way expresses
the standpoint of the museum."

02:16:41.333 --> 02:16:44.891
"The clip was produced
in sheer speculation to generate

02:16:45.066 --> 02:16:49.466
attention for
an upcoming exhibition."

02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:53.465
- So it's all speculation?
- What exhibition is that?

02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.191
Will you be blowing up kids?

02:16:57.366 --> 02:17:00.299
What kind of exhibition is it?

02:17:00.898 --> 02:17:04.593
To best explain
the theme of the exhibition,

02:17:04.767 --> 02:17:07.460
I'll quote the artist's
manifesto,

02:17:07.566 --> 02:17:09.761
which goes something
like this:

02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:15.325
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.

02:17:15.566 --> 02:17:18.534
Within it, we all share
equal rights and obligations."

02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:22.599
- Could you repeat that?
- Quiet, let him talk.

02:17:25.733 --> 02:17:29.598
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.

02:17:29.767 --> 02:17:32.734
Within it, we all share
equal rights and obligations."

02:17:39.165 --> 02:17:43.224
- What's the name of the artist?
- Lola Arias.

02:17:43.866 --> 02:17:47.822
- Repeat her last name, please.
- A-R-I-A-S.

02:17:49.165 --> 02:17:52.065
All the press material
is on our website.

02:17:52.933 --> 02:17:54.525
Including photos
of Lola Arias?

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:56.231
Yes, in high-resolution.

02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:59.367
Both of the artist
and of some of her work.

02:17:59.633 --> 02:18:04.225
There is an extensive press kit
to download there.

02:18:13.866 --> 02:18:18.822
Museum speculates in disgusting
details to grab attention

02:18:22.165 --> 02:18:28.326
Imam, Priest and Rabbi:
stand united against PR campaign

02:18:34.733 --> 02:18:38.893
Here is the exhibition
they wanted to launch

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.691
<i>The coaches are
Therese Johansson,</i>

02:18:55.898 --> 02:18:59.059
<i>Yasemin Beyasit,
and Josephine Kalmlund.</i>

02:18:59.266 --> 02:19:03.029
<i>And here come the "Bobcats"!</i>

02:20:08.333 --> 02:20:10.527
Great! Let's go for it!

02:20:18.866 --> 02:20:20.662
Go, girls!

02:20:47.766 --> 02:20:49.529
Hey guys,
great job today.

02:20:49.732 --> 02:20:52.325
Good teamwork.
Way to work together.

02:20:52.533 --> 02:20:53.999
Really, really proud
of you girls.

02:20:55.799 --> 02:20:57.061
Hey Elna, listen.

02:20:57.899 --> 02:20:59.230
What's with your attitude?

02:21:00.533 --> 02:21:01.658
Look at me.

02:21:02.933 --> 02:21:05.594
Sitting there feeling sorry
for yourself isn't gonna help.

02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:09.828
Okay? Stop wasting your energy
on those thoughts.

02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:12.123
Use it to help the team.

02:21:13.099 --> 02:21:17.362
You guys, if you mess up,
correct it and move on.

02:21:18.066 --> 02:21:20.192
Feeling guilt isn't
gonna help you.

02:21:21.333 --> 02:21:23.856
Okay?
How do you feel?

02:21:25.599 --> 02:21:26.998
How do you feel?

02:21:27.933 --> 02:21:30.661
All right.
Go ahead and take your showers.

02:21:31.333 --> 02:21:32.493
Very good.

02:21:45.933 --> 02:21:48.025
Hey, where are we going?

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.593
I'll explain in a minute.

02:22:19.366 --> 02:22:23.231
Remember that boy who was
waiting for us the other night?

02:22:27.632 --> 02:22:32.328
He lives over there.
I need to talk to him.

02:22:35.166 --> 02:22:37.463
It will only take ten minutes.
Twenty, tops.

02:22:37.632 --> 02:22:39.826
You don't mind
waiting in the car, do you?

02:22:41.732 --> 02:22:43.290
Is that okay?

02:23:02.199 --> 02:23:03.722
Daddy?

02:23:07.532 --> 02:23:09.056
Daddy!

02:23:11.966 --> 02:23:13.592
What is it?

02:23:13.799 --> 02:23:16.028
Could we come along too?

02:23:19.899 --> 02:23:23.855
- Well, if she wants to.
- Do you?

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:30.589
Sure, let's go.

02:23:58.933 --> 02:24:01.900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:24:39.899 --> 02:24:43.764
Hello... Sorry to bother you.
My name is Christian.

02:24:44.799 --> 02:24:48.664
This may sound a bit crazy,
but I was hoping...

02:24:48.933 --> 02:24:53.992
Did you happen to get a letter
accusing you of being a thief?

02:24:57.366 --> 02:25:00.389
Claiming that you stole
a phone and a wallet?

02:25:01.233 --> 02:25:03.825
- Pardon?
- A letter.

02:25:04.166 --> 02:25:07.599
Accusing you of being a thief.

02:25:12.099 --> 02:25:17.589
- What did you say I got?
- A letter with a weird message.

02:25:21.266 --> 02:25:22.926
- In my letterbox?
- Yes.

02:25:23.166 --> 02:25:25.359
I put them through
all the slots in this building.

02:25:29.399 --> 02:25:31.559
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:25:32.033 --> 02:25:36.057
Could anyone else
in your household have found it?

02:25:37.333 --> 02:25:39.856
My ex-wife comes around
to clean.

02:25:40.066 --> 02:25:43.999
She throws away any mail
that doesn't have my name on it.

02:25:47.233 --> 02:25:48.358
I have one more question...

02:25:48.599 --> 02:25:53.124
Are there any kids living
in this building?

02:25:54.233 --> 02:25:57.324
- Sure, why do you ask?
- I'm looking for a boy.

02:25:58.399 --> 02:26:03.299
He's, like, ten or 12...
Pitch-black hair.

02:26:06.033 --> 02:26:09.159
About this tall?
Really dark hair...

02:26:09.432 --> 02:26:12.298
- Ten, 13-years old...
- That's right.

02:26:12.432 --> 02:26:13.729
Does he live here?

02:26:14.432 --> 02:26:16.456
He used to.
I haven't seen him around.

02:26:17.732 --> 02:26:20.858
- The family used to live here?
- I think they moved.

02:26:23.899 --> 02:26:25.331
I see...

02:26:25.499 --> 02:26:28.489
- Do you know where they moved?
- No, not a clue.

02:26:35.866 --> 02:26:37.594
I'm afraid I can't help you.

02:26:46.066 --> 02:26:48.532
- Okay.
- Bye.
