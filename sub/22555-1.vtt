01:07.500 --> 01:08.534
- Morning.

01:08.536 --> 01:08.534
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.437
There is a customer who
wants a consultation

01:11.439 --> 01:12.371
at the register.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.772
- Okay, I'll be two seconds.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.341
- Also, you know how
today's my last day

01:16.343 --> 01:17.709
before I go to med school.

01:17.711 --> 01:18.710
- Shit, I didn't realize.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.345
- Yeah.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.981
I'm having this thing tonight
at chacha if you wanna come.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.483
- Ah, damn, I'd love to

01:24.485 --> 01:26.785
but I can't tonight, i
got plans, I'm sorry.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.488
But thank you for everything,
you've been awesome.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.457
- Yeah no, it's fine.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.858
It's been great working for you.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.659
- You're gonna kill it.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.793
- Thank you.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.801
- Very good.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.670
- Little better.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.506
- It hurts some more?

02:21.508 --> 02:23.342
You're doing so good.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.914
Okay, you don't need me anymore.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.349
Just go and have fun.

02:32.887 --> 02:34.786
- What's up?

02:34.788 --> 02:36.421
- Well she doesn't
have her insurance

02:36.423 --> 02:38.724
so I don't know what to do.

02:38.726 --> 02:39.758
- Is it for you?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.727
- No, it's for my mom.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.730
She's really sick and
it's very expensive,

02:44.732 --> 02:46.365
I really need it.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.367
- Hey, I'll cover it

02:48.369 --> 02:49.535
and then she can pay
next time or something.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.302
- Are you sure?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.403
- Have a good day.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.939
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

02:55.808 --> 02:58.877
- I just get on my phone
and I just start swiping.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.646
I like black girls,
i like persian girls,

03:00.648 --> 03:02.447
I like white girls,
i like Asian,

03:02.449 --> 03:05.384
well I've never been to
the Asian world as you have

03:05.386 --> 03:06.652
and sometimes--

03:06.654 --> 03:07.419
- a big ole
racist over here.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.287
- I'm not racist.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.555
- Yeah, you are.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.455
- You have your
own thing too, man.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.157
You love Asian girls, you know.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.625
Bethany was clearly Japanese.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.927
You wouldn't shut up about her.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.228
- I knew she was
clearly Japanese,

03:16.230 --> 03:17.496
but I married her
because I loved her

03:17.498 --> 03:18.797
not because I was like,
oh I need a Japanese.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.898
- How many
times did he say,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.300
Bethany takowa.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.267
Bethany takowa.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.502
The whole time.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.436
- You like
their name, you say it.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.337
- But she was Japanese,

03:25.339 --> 03:26.605
that's what we're talking about.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.673
- She
was half Japanese.

03:27.675 --> 03:27.673
- Yeah so.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.908
- That's his
wife man, come on.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.343
- My ex, ex wife.
- Ex wife,

03:31.345 --> 03:32.644
so it shouldn't matter because--

03:32.646 --> 03:33.845
- well yes, but we don't
have to talk about her

03:33.847 --> 03:35.847
like that, I don't know.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.782
- Let's not talk about her.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.683
- And you're a lucky man

03:37.685 --> 03:37.683
for having an Asian girl,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.818
that's all it is.
- Thank you, thank you.

03:39.820 --> 03:39.818
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.286
do you need anything?

03:41.288 --> 03:42.187
- I'm good.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.522
- Alright.
- You?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.290
- Why'd you
bring up Bethany?

03:45.292 --> 03:46.658
- Because we talking
about fucking

03:46.660 --> 03:47.993
persians and blacks and latinas

03:47.995 --> 03:50.829
and fucking asians fit in that.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.465
- So does
he have a job?

03:53.467 --> 03:54.967
Does he work, does
he make money?

03:54.969 --> 03:57.035
- He says he's an
instagram model.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.370
- An instagram model?

03:58.372 --> 03:59.705
- Let's just let that
hang there for a second.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.472
- What is that?
- Instagram model,

04:00.474 --> 04:01.373
that's not a job.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.208
- Show me his photos.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.876
Oh my god, crazy abs.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.345
- You have an
appetite, you know that?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.480
You have an appetite to.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.718
- I'm not dating
as many people as you are.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.219
- I'm not dating as many people,

04:14.221 --> 04:15.153
I'm just trying to find

04:15.155 --> 04:17.856
someone who can make me cum.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.559
- This is
a girl's night.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.793
- Crazy abs' texting.
- Girls?

04:21.795 --> 04:22.995
Girl night?

04:22.997 --> 04:24.196
- How're you guys doing?
- Hi, how are you?

04:24.198 --> 04:25.998
- Is everything okay?

04:28.334 --> 04:30.969
Try to make sure it's
always good for you guys.

04:30.971 --> 04:35.207
Are you sure you don't
need anything else?

04:35.209 --> 04:36.908
- Bye,
love you, be safe.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.095
- My best friend
had met her boyfriend

04:57.097 --> 04:58.196
at the time on the app

04:58.198 --> 04:59.831
and suggested I try it.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.733
Just kind of for fun basically,

05:01.735 --> 05:02.901
and I didn't even realize this,

05:02.903 --> 05:03.902
but when I moved
into the building

05:03.904 --> 05:05.203
my best friend at the time

05:05.205 --> 05:07.406
was sleeping with the
guy on the fifth floor,

05:07.408 --> 05:08.907
so she would literally go out

05:08.909 --> 05:10.342
and then come to my apartment

05:10.344 --> 05:11.677
and I would fluff her hair

05:11.679 --> 05:11.677
and then she would
go sleep with him

05:11.679 --> 05:13.779
and come back.
- No.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.713
- And then sleep
in the same, yeah,

05:14.715 --> 05:15.747
they'd tell me all about it.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.916
And so you're not a doctor?

05:17.918 --> 05:18.750
- No.
- You're a pharma dude.

05:18.752 --> 05:18.750
- Yeah.

05:18.752 --> 05:18.750
- So what's
the difference?

05:18.752 --> 05:22.688
- Well the doctor,
you know is a doctor.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.955
- Oh right.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.791
- I work in the pharmacy.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.359
- Right.

05:45.578 --> 05:46.378
- Hey.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.512
- What's up?

05:51.951 --> 05:53.485
- Oh shit.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.286
Oh shit.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.887
- Oh god.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.952
Do you want to go
down on me now?

06:27.653 --> 06:29.955
- We kinda just met.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.090
Hey I'm gonna go shower.

06:47.974 --> 06:48.774
- You okay?

06:48.776 --> 06:49.975
- Yeah, yeah.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.812
I took too many.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.882
- Took too many what?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.183
- Klonopin.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.953
- How many did you take?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.522
- I don't remember.

07:05.124 --> 07:07.058
- I'm gonna get you
a glass of water.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.293
- No, I'm good.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.397
- Okay I'll be right back.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.832
- Okay.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.685
- Let it out, let it out.

09:42.181 --> 09:42.981
- Hey!

09:42.983 --> 09:43.982
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:43.984 --> 09:44.916
Sorry.

09:46.185 --> 09:46.985
How's it going?

09:46.987 --> 09:48.620
- Good.
- Yeah?

09:48.622 --> 09:50.689
I got a shot of Jameson.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.523
- Oh.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.525
- Okay?
- Perfect, yeah.

09:57.563 --> 10:01.866
- Would it be better if
you go to my place or?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.068
- Oh yeah.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.403
But do you want to
have a beer before?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.905
- Yeah,
yeah yeah, of course.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.839
Modelo?

10:07.841 --> 10:07.839
- Yeah.
- That good?

10:07.841 --> 10:10.175
Can we get two modelos?

10:10.177 --> 10:11.977
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.411
How long you been on wings?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.748
- A while, I don't
know yeah, yeah.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.016
How long have you been?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.751
- Like six months.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.719
I go through phases though,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.253
like sometimes I use it

10:22.255 --> 10:24.155
and then other times I just.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.357
I don't know if I'm a big fan.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.392
- Really, why?

10:28.861 --> 10:31.730
- I mean to be
honest I feel like,

10:31.732 --> 10:33.765
80% of the time i
feel like a dildo

10:33.767 --> 10:35.567
attached to a warm body.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.235
I do, that's the honest truth.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.871
People look at me and
I'm like, that's it.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.940
You're from Spain originally?

10:41.942 --> 10:42.741
- Yeah.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.541
- Where about?

10:43.543 --> 10:44.342
- From Barcelona.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.343
I came here for school.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.678
- Oh yeah?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.779
- And then I like it
and then I stayed.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.447
Yeah, nine years I've been here.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.716
- What were you studying?

10:51.718 --> 10:53.084
- I did history

10:53.086 --> 10:55.687
and then I did two
bachelor degrees.

10:55.689 --> 10:59.190
But not just partial
like, psychology.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.425
- Right.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.261
- And then
evolutionary biology.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.696
- Wow.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.930
- They're very different.
- That's a lot of school.

11:05.932 --> 11:05.930
- Yeah, it's a lot.

11:05.932 --> 11:10.902
- Tell me something
evolutionarily biological.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.238
Most fascinating
biological fact.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.540
- Yeah one, maybe you know,

11:15.542 --> 11:17.442
is that, you know that

11:18.544 --> 11:21.279
the tip of the human penis,

11:21.281 --> 11:24.082
it's shaped like a mushroom.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.284
Well like, some penises
are shaped like.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.585
- Most, I think, yeah.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.520
- Most.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.157
So that's just
literally because then

11:32.159 --> 11:34.926
the penis can scoop out

11:34.928 --> 11:38.530
another man's sperm
from inside the vagina.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.632
- What?

11:40.634 --> 11:42.000
- Yeah, they go there
and they do like,

11:42.002 --> 11:43.301
this is my thing,
this is my place,

11:43.303 --> 11:44.636
just fuck off.

11:45.738 --> 11:48.973
- It's like a weird
pooper scooper for jizz.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.508
- Yeah.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.910
- Wow.

11:51.912 --> 11:52.944
And then what else?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.412
You studied all three of those,

11:54.414 --> 11:55.647
you still in school, no?

11:55.649 --> 11:56.815
- No no, I'm working now.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.149
- Where you working?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.350
- I'm a physical
therapy assistant.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.618
- Okay cool.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.953
- Maybe this is the
problem, I don't know,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.155
but I really like new things.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.491
You know, constant newness.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.425
- Right.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.326
- When there's something new,

12:08.328 --> 12:10.328
I'm really into it, I go for it

12:10.330 --> 12:11.763
and then after a
while I ditch it.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.598
Like I don't like it
anymore, I get bored,

12:13.600 --> 12:16.801
whatever, so, I just
go like, okay whatever.

12:16.803 --> 12:17.702
You know?

12:17.704 --> 12:19.003
- Yeah, I get that.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.171
- It's hard for
me to really know

12:20.173 --> 12:21.639
what I want to do.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.274
- You just gotta start
doing something, right?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.442
I mean at some point
i had to leave school

12:24.444 --> 12:27.312
and press play and real life.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.948
- You have pressed play?

12:32.284 --> 12:33.685
- I haven't pressed play,

12:33.687 --> 12:35.620
I kinda, I just,

12:35.622 --> 12:37.622
I unplugged the console and
threw it out the window,

12:37.624 --> 12:39.858
and just stopped playing

12:39.860 --> 12:43.728
because I was like,
this game's rigged.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.662
Wanna have another beer here?

12:44.664 --> 12:45.997
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:57.376 --> 12:59.144
- The other way?
- Other way.

12:59.146 --> 12:59.144
- Red.
- Red.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.979
See.
- Red, wait wait wait.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.380
- That one.

where is Bethany.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.579
I think I should know
something about that.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.247
- She made a mistake, okay.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.583
Her brain's
deteriorating, she can't

30:19.585 --> 30:21.018
figure a lot of stuff out

30:21.020 --> 30:21.018
you just have to get past it.
- Yeah, but that's

30:21.020 --> 30:23.453
the other thing, I know that,

30:23.455 --> 30:25.355
I know that, because
your dad has talked to me

30:25.357 --> 30:26.957
about that today.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.959
You have not said that
to me about your mom.

30:28.961 --> 30:32.396
You have not said that
you have a sister.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.232
- I don't, so.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.255
- Just talk to me.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.291
Do you have a sister?

31:01.293 --> 31:04.862
- No, gabi, I don't have
a sister, she's dead.

31:05.496 --> 31:06.296
- She's dead?

31:06.298 --> 31:08.398
- Yeah, please, stop.

31:17.242 --> 31:18.775
- I'm sorry.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.444
- It's fine, but
you keep digging.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.478
- I'm not digging.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.513
Don't say that, I'm asking.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.815
Because I should know

31:24.817 --> 31:26.083
because I'm your
girlfriend, right?

31:26.085 --> 31:26.984
I mean.

31:28.419 --> 31:31.555
Girlfriends know
that kind of stuff.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.596
You wanna talk about it?

31:42.700 --> 31:44.034
You can talk about it with me.

31:44.036 --> 31:44.835
- Fine, I'll talk about it.

31:44.837 --> 31:46.503
Okay, look.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.306
My sister died in a car
accident when she was 16.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.474
The money from the settlement

31:50.476 --> 31:51.708
paid for me to go to college,

31:51.710 --> 31:53.143
it completely
destroyed my family,

31:53.145 --> 31:56.680
and it's never been
the same since then.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.484
Is that better?

32:02.387 --> 32:04.454
- Yeah, it's better
because I know.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.290
But I don't want you
to say it's better

32:06.292 --> 32:07.591
like an asshole.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.327
- Okay so now

32:10.329 --> 32:11.161
I talk to you.
- Because I'm finding

32:11.163 --> 32:12.129
it out.
- I talk to you

32:12.131 --> 32:13.530
and I'm the asshole still.

32:13.532 --> 32:13.530
- I mean, Martin

32:13.532 --> 32:13.530
you're talking to me about--
- I try to tell you something

32:13.532 --> 32:17.501
that's personal to me--
- because I find out.

32:17.503 --> 32:17.501
- And you
call me an asshole?

32:17.503 --> 32:20.637
Yeah great, perfect,
yeah thanks.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.208
- I'm just saying that

32:25.210 --> 32:26.977
I'm right now talking
about that with you

32:26.979 --> 32:28.512
because I'm finding out

32:28.514 --> 32:30.414
not because you're
talking about it.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.416
I just want you to tell
me about everything.

32:32.418 --> 32:33.717
I'm not digging!

32:33.719 --> 32:35.152
- I want all of this with you

32:35.154 --> 32:36.720
but I don't fucking
need to talk about

32:36.722 --> 32:38.989
everything from my past, okay?

32:38.991 --> 32:40.590
- But I'm here for that too,

32:40.592 --> 32:42.893
I'm not here just
for fun and for now.

32:42.895 --> 32:44.094
- I know

32:44.096 --> 32:45.228
you're not here for fun!
- And for parties.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.430
I wanna know
everything about you.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.031
I wanna know your mom is sick

32:48.033 --> 32:50.500
and I wanna know you have
a sister that is dead

32:50.502 --> 32:52.369
and I wanna know that
you have an ex wife

32:52.371 --> 32:54.538
that is so important
in your fucking family.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.239
I wanna know everything of this.

32:56.241 --> 32:57.541
Because I think I should know!
- Gabi, please!

32:57.543 --> 32:58.742
You're not talking to me

32:58.744 --> 32:59.743
about that.
- I tried to talk to you

32:59.745 --> 33:00.677
but then--
- you're not

33:00.679 --> 33:01.778
talking to me about that!

33:01.780 --> 33:03.080
- It's not fucking

33:03.082 --> 33:04.381
good enough for you.
- Just talk to me!

33:04.383 --> 33:05.615
- Everything I do
is not good enough.

33:05.617 --> 33:05.615
Gabi I don't wanna
fucking talk about it.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.185
- Why not!
- Because there's shit--

33:08.187 --> 33:08.952
- why not!
- There's shit you

33:08.954 --> 33:10.287
don't wanna talk about.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.355
- I wanna talk about
everything with you!

33:11.357 --> 33:12.255
- No, let's talk about the shit

33:12.257 --> 33:13.590
you don't wanna talk about.

33:13.592 --> 33:14.358
Let's talk about all
the guys you fucked

33:14.360 --> 33:15.659
the night we met.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.399
- Fucking asshole.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.668
You're a fucking asshole.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.824
- The very
definition of humanity

33:47.826 --> 33:49.126
is changing as we know it.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.594
And that's only happened
like three times ever.

33:50.596 --> 33:51.595
- Right.
- First.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.597
There was a gradual transition

33:53.599 --> 33:55.399
from hunter gatherer
to agriculture.

33:55.401 --> 33:55.399
- Yeah.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.068
- Then, this part's
gonna blow your mind,

33:58.070 --> 33:59.603
there was the flushable toilet,

33:59.605 --> 34:03.073
which, I already
fucked up, sorry dude.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.141
- No, it's okay.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.075
- Ignore my penmanship,

34:05.077 --> 34:06.009
and that is my favorite part,

34:06.011 --> 34:07.511
and that's what is robbing us

34:07.513 --> 34:08.578
of our understanding

34:08.580 --> 34:09.946
of what it means to be human.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.681
It is literally destroying

34:11.683 --> 34:11.681
our emotional spectrum.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.618
There's only like or shame,

34:14.620 --> 34:17.687
pleasure or pain,
all extremes no gray,

34:17.688 --> 34:20.489
which is funny, because
it was our grayness

34:20.492 --> 34:22.592
that made us human all along.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.860
What do you think?

34:23.862 --> 34:26.663
- It's good, I like
the emotional spectrum

34:26.665 --> 34:30.699
and that being the
grayness, it's cool,

34:30.702 --> 34:32.702
as long as it doesn't
get cheesy at the end.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.139
In the wrong hands it
could get a little.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.275
How's Quinn?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.945
- She's
good, she's great.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.280
Can't believe it, man.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.181
- What?

34:44.183 --> 34:44.181
- 10 years,
that's fucking crazy.

34:44.183 --> 34:48.819
- 10 years.
- I know next Tuesday.

34:48.821 --> 34:49.753
- Jeez.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.356
- How's gabi?

34:53.358 --> 34:54.891
- She's good.

34:54.893 --> 34:55.826
- Good.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.862
Do you love her?

34:58.864 --> 35:00.030
- I think so.

35:01.199 --> 35:03.533
I think I love her, yeah.

35:03.535 --> 35:04.868
- Strong enough, because
you're so strong,

35:04.870 --> 35:07.737
maybe we have to do something.

35:07.739 --> 35:07.737
Hey.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.540
- Oh hey.
- How are you?

35:10.542 --> 35:10.540
- Good.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.810
I have a consultation
appointment with Tim.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.579
- With Tim?
- You're not Tim.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.813
- No no,
he's gonna be here,

35:16.815 --> 35:17.681
hi, I'm hiding myself.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.416
- I'll go over here.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.417
I know you right?

35:20.419 --> 35:21.318
- What?
- Wait.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.385
- Oh yeah.
- From covelle.

35:22.387 --> 35:23.687
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

35:23.689 --> 35:23.687
- You're
there every night.

35:23.689 --> 35:23.687
- You eat there with
your girlfriends.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.990
Yeah, well I manage the place.

35:26.992 --> 35:26.990
- Oh really?
- So I'm there every night.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.493
- Oh my god I love that place.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.561
Tim is coming in a minute,
if you wanna sit down.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.696
- Okay.
- Yeah.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.564
- I'll wait, yeah.
- Sure.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.034
Okay let's move your leg now.

35:42.073 --> 35:43.874
- Fuck yes, out like a light.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.075
- Yeah?
- Yup.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.447
- You still not on Facebook?

35:50.449 --> 35:52.582
- Still not on Facebook.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.186
- Bethany might have blocked me.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.021
- Maybe she's not on Facebook.

35:58.023 --> 35:58.922
- She was.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.259
- Maybe she's off.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.027
You can delete an
account, right?

36:04.029 --> 36:05.028
- Yeah, but.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.263
- Probably deleted it.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.397
- I don't think you
can delete it for good,

36:07.399 --> 36:10.066
it's still there somewhere.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.368
- That's what creeps me
out about the Internet,

36:11.370 --> 36:14.037
it's like everything
is always still there.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.839
- Has Quinn seen her?

36:17.208 --> 36:18.108
- No.

36:19.210 --> 36:21.545
Last I heard she moved
to Santa Monica to like

36:21.547 --> 36:24.247
do music licensing or something.

36:33.658 --> 36:34.591
Fuck.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.828
- Could sit here all day.

36:39.831 --> 36:40.664
- Hey.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.898
- Hi gabi.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.800
- Hi, how was that?

36:43.802 --> 36:44.734
- It was good.
- Yeah?

36:44.736 --> 36:45.835
- It was really good yeah.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.771
- Yeah, he's the best.

36:48.673 --> 36:50.640
- He worked me good.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.778
I was thinking about when

36:54.780 --> 36:56.246
when I was getting my therapy,

36:56.248 --> 37:00.183
there's this amazing party
tonight with this chef

37:00.185 --> 37:01.952
Charlie Dominic, have
you heard of him?

37:01.954 --> 37:03.653
- Yeah, you know him?

37:03.655 --> 37:04.955
- Yeah we're close,

37:04.957 --> 37:06.189
let's just say we're close,

37:06.191 --> 37:07.958
but he's having this
private dinner tonight.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.526
Would you wanna come with me?

37:09.528 --> 37:13.196
- No, I have some
stuff to do, sorry.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.631
- No, no no no.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.834
No no no, I won't
take no for an answer.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.670
I can't, I've done all this.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.840
I feel like I almost
even came here

37:23.842 --> 37:28.178
to see you, even though i
didn't know you were here but.

37:29.313 --> 37:32.949
I just think about
that, and make my night.

37:35.453 --> 37:36.386
Bye.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.320
- Bye.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.633
- Oh my god.

37:49.635 --> 37:50.867
My baby.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.369
- Oh my god I missed you.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.004
I missed you.
- I missed you so much.

37:54.006 --> 37:55.005
I'm so bored here.

37:55.007 --> 37:56.806
- Hey, how are ya?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.975
- Hey, good yeah, how are you?

37:58.977 --> 38:01.511
- Yeah good good,
how come you're back?

38:01.513 --> 38:02.812
- Just down
for the weekend.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.347
- Right.

38:04.349 --> 38:08.184
- No but for
real, tonight we are going

38:09.654 --> 38:13.223
to some salsa at los
globos at eight P.M.

38:13.225 --> 38:15.558
So you buddy, you're
coming with us, okay?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.493
- I'll try.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.894
I'll do my best.

38:17.896 --> 38:21.164
- Well, I mean you missed
my going away party.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.499
- I did.
- So I just wanna

38:22.501 --> 38:26.002
put it out there that
you do owe me a drink.

38:27.872 --> 38:30.507
- How is Claire treating you?

41:57.314 --> 41:58.781
- Hey.

42:01.986 --> 42:04.387
I thought you had an
early appointment.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.289
- I just washed those.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.192
- I didn't know.

42:13.130 --> 42:16.232
Want a tea or
coffee or anything?

42:50.034 --> 42:50.967
What's wrong?

42:54.271 --> 42:55.171
Baby.

42:56.674 --> 42:57.607
Hey.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.009
Why're you upset?

43:01.111 --> 43:02.645
What's going on?

43:07.017 --> 43:07.951
What's up?

43:13.691 --> 43:14.624
You okay?

43:18.028 --> 43:20.463
- I think we have a problem.

43:20.465 --> 43:21.998
- Why what's up?

43:26.704 --> 43:30.340
- I cheated on you
last night, I'm sorry.

44:03.107 --> 44:04.307
Martin.

44:14.852 --> 44:17.420
Do you wanna tell me something?

44:22.259 --> 44:25.361
Do you want to
tell me something?

44:26.964 --> 44:27.897
What?

44:31.435 --> 44:33.102
- I did the same.

44:38.976 --> 44:39.909
I'm sorry.

45:05.636 --> 45:08.404
- Do you still love me?

45:12.342 --> 45:13.276
- Yeah.

45:14.845 --> 45:18.481
- I never felt like
this for anyone before.

45:19.950 --> 45:21.451
- We can make this work.

45:21.453 --> 45:23.486
We can figure it out.

45:24.254 --> 45:25.088
Please?

45:25.090 --> 45:25.988
- Yeah.

45:27.324 --> 45:28.658
We can fix it.

45:28.660 --> 45:29.592
- Yeah.

45:32.262 --> 45:33.996
- It was something

45:35.699 --> 45:37.600
freeing about, i
thought fuck it,

45:37.602 --> 45:39.435
you only live once.

45:39.437 --> 45:41.471
- Because it was new,

45:43.107 --> 45:44.807
and it was exciting.

45:46.710 --> 45:48.678
- What
would happen if you,

45:48.680 --> 45:50.780
if you shared your feelings?

45:50.782 --> 45:53.683
If you told gabi
what you told me?

45:58.155 --> 46:01.190
- I don't think i
could tell her that.

46:01.192 --> 46:03.025
- He will think I'm

46:05.329 --> 46:06.262
a monster.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.835
- She'd think I was
a different person,

46:12.837 --> 46:15.371
that I wasn't who she loves.

46:17.908 --> 46:22.278
- What if you
found out that she related?

46:23.814 --> 46:26.582
To you, what if
you found out that

46:26.584 --> 46:29.986
the two of you had a
lot more in common?

46:29.988 --> 46:31.754
You might be surprised.

46:31.756 --> 46:34.223
- Maybe love is not enough.

46:35.225 --> 46:37.360
Maybe we're not in love.

46:44.735 --> 46:48.304
I am in love, I am
in love, I know that,

46:50.541 --> 46:52.875
but maybe it's not enough.

46:55.245 --> 46:58.381
- I wanna give you
guys a challenge.

46:59.416 --> 47:02.418
When you go home I want
you to sit down and

47:02.420 --> 47:05.421
try to be 100% honest
with each other

47:05.423 --> 47:08.624
about anything,
just for an hour.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.626
And it can be small.

47:10.628 --> 47:13.296
In fact it should be to start.

47:13.298 --> 47:15.398
It's gonna take some time

47:15.400 --> 47:17.700
and a little bit of courage.

47:17.702 --> 47:20.536
It takes courage to me in love.

47:25.709 --> 47:27.443
- Okay.
- Alright.

47:27.445 --> 47:29.979
- You say something honest
and then you take a sip.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.414
You cannot drink if you are not

47:31.416 --> 47:33.416
saying something honest first.

47:33.418 --> 47:34.450
- Okay.

47:34.452 --> 47:34.450
- Okay.

47:34.452 --> 47:38.421
With how many people
did you sleep?

47:39.256 --> 47:40.957
- That'll be around,

47:41.892 --> 47:43.092
I mean I don't keep count,

47:43.094 --> 47:45.728
but it's gonna be high 20s-ish.

47:46.797 --> 47:48.264
- How old were you

47:48.266 --> 47:50.099
when you lost your virginity?

47:50.101 --> 47:52.101
- I was 16 I was
thinking that he was

47:52.103 --> 47:54.170
so so sexy and I was excited

47:54.172 --> 47:57.139
and we had sex a few times

47:57.141 --> 47:58.941
and then he stopped
talking to me

47:58.943 --> 48:02.311
after it, so I went
back to Barcelona

48:02.313 --> 48:03.679
and then next summer
i came back here

48:03.681 --> 48:05.414
and then I saw this guy again

48:05.416 --> 48:09.518
and he wanted to have
sex with me again

48:09.520 --> 48:10.586
but then I,

48:12.689 --> 48:15.258
I fucked his friend instead.

48:16.660 --> 48:18.494
- Why, what?

48:19.529 --> 48:20.730
- I don't know.

48:23.634 --> 48:26.068
I don't know, I was 16, so.

48:29.306 --> 48:31.674
- When I was nine I would,

48:34.378 --> 48:36.812
I can't believe I'm
telling you this,

48:36.814 --> 48:40.149
I would watch my
sister in the shower.

48:42.519 --> 48:44.387
- Why do you feel
bad about that?

48:44.389 --> 48:46.389
- 'Cause I can't believe

48:46.391 --> 48:49.125
you were just cool
about that, I was like.

48:49.127 --> 48:52.595
- I mean kids do
that, they're curious.

48:53.664 --> 48:56.832
I could just be there
watching with you, for sure.

48:56.834 --> 48:58.467
It's really okay.

49:00.871 --> 49:02.171
- What is it?

49:02.173 --> 49:03.472
It's always there
you're grabbing.

49:03.474 --> 49:05.875
- I don't know, there's
something I like here.

49:05.877 --> 49:09.478
It's like ,

49:09.480 --> 49:11.414
I touch it and i
feel like.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.952
- I have another one.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.221
- Okay tell me.

49:19.223 --> 49:22.625
- I want you really
really bad right now.

49:29.766 --> 49:32.234
Come on, let's go to bed.

49:32.236 --> 49:34.670
- No, let's stay here.

49:36.540 --> 49:37.340
- Gabi.

49:37.342 --> 49:38.240
- What?

49:39.609 --> 49:41.544
- People will see us.

49:41.546 --> 49:42.945
- So what?

49:42.947 --> 49:43.913
- So I don't.

49:43.915 --> 49:45.614
- So what?

49:45.616 --> 49:47.216
Fuck them.

49:47.218 --> 49:49.218
We can do it like this.

50:22.387 --> 50:24.820
- Say hi to him.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.775
- Who was that?

50:52.783 --> 50:55.718
- The guy I slept
with that night.

51:09.599 --> 51:12.001
- Do you want other people?

51:13.937 --> 51:17.840
- Sometimes I miss
flirting with other people.

51:19.643 --> 51:20.810
Do you?

51:23.480 --> 51:26.048
- Part of me does, yeah.

51:26.050 --> 51:28.617
- Which part of you doesn't?

51:29.553 --> 51:33.289
- The part that's
afraid I'll lose you.

51:33.291 --> 51:34.523
- If you're honest with me,

51:34.525 --> 51:36.826
you will never lose me.

51:39.362 --> 51:41.363
Just have to be honest.

51:42.833 --> 51:44.967
- Yeah, let's be honest.

51:46.570 --> 51:51.373
- No secrets, no family
secrets, no sex secrets,

51:51.375 --> 51:52.174
okay?

51:52.176 --> 51:53.709
- Yeah.

51:55.212 --> 51:58.080
- If you wanna
flirt with a girl,

51:58.082 --> 52:00.549
you can do it, just tell me.

52:04.187 --> 52:05.654
- Okay.

52:05.656 --> 52:07.389
- You sure?
- Yeah.

52:08.525 --> 52:09.492
- Who's party
did Blake say it was?

52:09.494 --> 52:09.492
- What?

52:09.494 --> 52:11.861

did Blake say it was?

52:11.863 --> 52:14.163
- I don't know.

52:14.165 --> 52:15.064
A friend?

52:15.866 --> 52:17.566
- It's gonna be fancy.

52:19.036 --> 52:21.737
Is Blake already here?

52:21.739 --> 52:22.538
- Yeah, I guess so,

52:22.540 --> 52:24.173

No bullshit.

54:01.706 --> 54:01.704
to start a friendship.

54:01.706 --> 54:04.039
- No but why not?
- Between guys.

54:49.553 --> 54:50.853
Yeah I'm hiding.

54:50.855 --> 54:52.488

54:54.325 --> 54:55.357
I'm not blending in.

54:55.359 --> 54:56.592
- You don't like my party?

No no, that's not what I meant.

54:59.764 --> 55:01.063

I mean it's not a
bad place to hide.

55:07.938 --> 55:08.871
- No it's good.

Do you have any coffee?

56:05.896 --> 56:07.062

My paralegal, she's great.

56:18.776 --> 56:20.142
- Yeah.

56:20.144 --> 56:21.777
- Were you surprised?

56:21.779 --> 56:23.746

56:23.748 --> 56:23.746
I don't wanna seem ungrateful,

56:23.748 --> 56:26.782
but I just came off
a 16 hour flight,

56:26.784 --> 56:28.917
I'd love to be in bed.

56:28.919 --> 56:30.586

56:30.588 --> 56:31.620
- Would you

56:31.622 --> 56:33.989
- Let's go and take a coffee.

56:35.792 --> 56:37.426
- If I was in mild peril,

56:37.428 --> 56:39.194
and you turned up,
I'd be thrilled.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.629
I'd be so happy with that.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.498
Like, perfect, save the day.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.867
I would be getting into
trouble purposefully.

56:44.869 --> 56:45.801
'Cause you're like.

56:45.803 --> 56:45.801
- Do I look like a superhero?

56:45.803 --> 56:48.637
- You have the
presence of a superhero.

56:48.639 --> 56:50.139
- The presence of a--

56:51.442 --> 56:52.541
- I just
meant the composure.

56:52.543 --> 56:53.776
The composure and,

56:53.778 --> 56:54.943
not like the presence.

well, yeah you're tall,

56:56.013 --> 56:57.880
you could be a superhero.

56:57.882 --> 57:00.015

57:00.017 --> 57:02.718
I go into art
gallery or museums.

57:02.720 --> 57:03.519
- Yeah?

57:03.521 --> 57:05.220

we have to choose

57:07.224 --> 57:11.160
one piece of art and we
have to take it home.

57:11.162 --> 57:12.728
- I thought you came with Blake.

57:12.730 --> 57:13.829
- Yeah, I came with her.

57:13.831 --> 57:15.464
I mean, she invited us.

57:15.466 --> 57:17.966
- Okay so, what would you take?

57:17.968 --> 57:19.868
What would you take
from the kitchen?

57:19.870 --> 57:22.438
- From this kitchen?
- Yeah.

57:24.340 --> 57:25.674

57:26.843 --> 57:28.043
- Good choice.

58:23.967 --> 58:24.933
- Sorry.

58:24.935 --> 58:26.134
- You go.
- Excuse us.

58:26.136 --> 58:27.870
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

58:29.873 --> 58:30.772
- Hey!

58:30.774 --> 58:32.040
Hey, what're you leaving?

58:32.042 --> 58:33.408
- Yeah we're leaving.

58:33.410 --> 58:34.977
- Well thanks for
helping me wake up.

58:34.979 --> 58:36.645
- No, thanks for the
party it was so good.

58:36.647 --> 58:37.746
- Yeah, thanks man.

58:37.748 --> 58:38.647
- See you around.
- Bye.

58:38.649 --> 58:40.516
- Bye.
- See ya later.

58:50.293 --> 58:52.427
- Did you like watching me?

58:52.429 --> 58:53.228
- Yeah.

58:53.230 --> 58:54.129
- Really?

58:54.131 --> 58:55.130
- Yeah, did you want him?

58:55.132 --> 58:57.399
- I want you.

59:13.516 --> 59:15.851
- What do you want?

59:15.853 --> 59:16.952
- I want to watch you

59:16.954 --> 59:19.655
get a lap dance from a stripper.

59:33.703 --> 59:35.137
What do you want?

59:36.205 --> 59:38.540
- I wanna spy on you.

59:38.542 --> 59:39.775
- How?

59:41.210 --> 59:43.946
- I wanna
watch you on a date.

59:43.948 --> 59:46.481
- Okay, this one.

59:46.483 --> 59:47.482
- Yeah.

59:47.484 --> 59:48.417
- Yeah?

59:50.053 --> 59:51.153
He's handsome.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.467
- What do you wanna do?

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:08.103
- What're we going to do now?

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.542
- Take him to ours.

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.044
- And then
he put on a condom,

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.213
and he took me from behind.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.147
- Where?

01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:21.817
- Against the wall.

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:22.584
- Did you cum?

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:23.719
- No.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:30.258
- What
else do you want?

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.194
- I want a threesome.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:33.762
- With who?

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:35.397
- You can choose.

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.233
- How about Blake?

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:39.201
- No friends.

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:45.007
It's complicated, friends.

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.541
- Yeah okay, no friends.

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:51.580
- Open relationship.
- Open relationship.

01:00:51.582 --> 01:00:53.715
- And yes, this one?

01:00:53.717 --> 01:00:54.650
- Yes.

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:57.019
No.

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.187
No.

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:00.322
No.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.325
Yes.

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:05.794
Fuck yes.

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.276
- What time is it?

01:01:54.278 --> 01:01:55.477
Like 10:30.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.313
Is she breathing?

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.682
I'm being serious.

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:04.086
She hasn't moved for
like five minutes.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.155
Oh, she's awake!

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.291
- Repeat after me,

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.293
I promise to always push you.

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:14.196
- I promise to always push you.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:15.664
- I promise to keep sending you

01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:17.432
in new directions.

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:22.671
- I'll keep sending
you in directions.

01:02:22.673 --> 01:02:24.306
- And never stop.

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:26.808
- And never stop.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:31.246
- And to do it together.

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.518
- And to do it together.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.621
- So the sacred cow
of the romantic ideal

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.323
is monogamy,

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:45.327
and the idea itself that
it could be negotiated

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.462
means already that
there's something missing.

01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:49.297
The conversation
about infidelity

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.299
and the conversation
about open relationships

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:53.001
is not the same one.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:55.971
Because the essence of
infidelity is secrets.

01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:59.141
It's organized around a secret.

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:01.042
The concept of an
open relationship

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.311
is that your
explorations with others

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:04.546
are not secret

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:06.882
and that notion that when I go

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.350
to look for someone else,

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:11.219
it's not always because i
wanna get away from you,

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:13.255
it's because I wanna
get away from the person

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.590
that I have myself become.

01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:18.226
And it's not that I want
to find somebody else,

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:20.495
but I want to find another self.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:24.065
I think it's at the core
of a lot of affairs.

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:26.334
There are people
who are trying to

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:29.337
basically reconcile
two sets of values,

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.439
two fundamental
sets of human needs.

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.241
Is to have one relationship

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:36.344
in which with you i
can have the anchor

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:36.344
and the waves.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:40.248
I can have the stability
and the security,

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.218
but I can also have the
freedom and the autonomy.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.719
And this improbable marriage,

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:47.255
between the feeling of belonging

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.292
and the feeling of
freedom with one person

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:52.394
is probably the great challenge

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:54.062
of modern love today.

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.402
- You wanna ask it.

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.304
- I don't know.
- What's you're name?

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:04.272
- She can't answer
all of our questions.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.373
- Enjoy.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:05.373
Thank you.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.776
- Hi, thank
you so much, gabi.

01:04:07.778 --> 01:04:09.211
- Hi gabi.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:10.378
- Martin.
- I'm Martin.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:10.378
Very nice to meet you.
- Hey Martin.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.614
- How's it going?
- Good, good.

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.249
- Thank you so much,
it was amazing.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.285
We are trying to do this
kind of open relationship

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.387
and just to listen to
someone recommending it

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:22.924
it makes you feel
like, okay, it's okay.

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:26.895
- So we are clear, I'm
not recommending it,

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:28.663
but that doesn't
mean it's not valued.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.932
So if you think of it as,

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:33.501
the thing that doesn't kill
us but makes us stronger,

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:36.504
then yes, but I really
want you to imagine it

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:40.475
less as a destination
and more as a layover.

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:53.555
- Gabi.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:56.291
Say hey for me.

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:01.596
- He says hi.

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:12.507
He's always so
excited when he says,

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:15.543
oh say Martin, hi hi, kiss.
- How is he?

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:17.012
Do you think they'll
come out and visit?

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:19.381
- No I was talking about,

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.816
maybe coming on Christmas
but they're like,

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:23.518
they don't know yet.

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.121
- That'd be fun.

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:27.489
- Yeah.
- I'd like that.

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:40.502
- Excuse me,
miss, can I help you?

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:43.571
- Actually you can,

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:45.540
because I'm like quite lost.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:46.474
- Welcome.

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:49.911
- Did you see that one?

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:51.413
- That was magic.
- Must've been three yards.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:51.413
- It's magical.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:51.413
- If half of what
you told me is true,

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:54.649
you gotta marry her asap.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:55.917
I'm serious, lock
that chick down, man.

01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:58.019
- It's good, we don't
own each other, but,

01:05:58.021 --> 01:05:59.421
it's made us a lot
closer, you know.

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.256
- And you're
genuinely okay if she

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:03.758
sleeps with other people,
it doesn't freak you out?

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.360
- So far like no,

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:07.562
no one's made her cum,

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:10.899
so it's kinda like,
makes me feel great.

01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:11.733
When she comes home I'm the one

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.435
that gets her off, so.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.770
- It's amazing.
- It's weird, I don't know.

01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:17.339
- I'm very jealous.

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:18.840
Ah shit.

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:20.275
You know what I did last night?

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:21.543
- What?

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.244
- I read Peter
petere pumpkin eater,

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:24.546
I changed a shitty diaper

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:28.016
and I fell asleep at
eight P.M. in a chair.

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:38.593
There's something i
gotta tell you man

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.195
and there's like no

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.999
cool way to do it, so,

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:49.037
I don't know how to say
it so I'm just gonna,

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.772
Bethany had a kid.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.312
After you brought
her up the other day,

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.447
I asked Quinn and
Quinn went on Facebook.

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:02.050
I guess she had a little boy

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:03.651
earlier this year with some guy.

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:05.553
I think he's an ex boyfriend.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:08.623
He's not in the picture but,

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:09.924
it's all Facebook info,

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:10.759
so I don't really
know what time,

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:12.727
I just, I knew that,

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:15.463
I knew that I should tell you.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.401
- I guess she did block me.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:58.740
- You married?

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:00.809
Twice?

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:01.843
- Divorced.

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.546
- Do you have kids?

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.050
- So does your boyfriend
know that you're here?

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:12.220
- Not yet,
but I'll tell him.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:14.722
- What're you guys like,
swingers or something?

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:15.657
- We're like open.

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:17.826
We tell each other everything.

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:19.627
- How does that work?

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.629
- It works good.

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:22.831
It's just being honest.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:25.066
- What do you get out of that?

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:26.367
- What do you mean?

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.535
Like I have to get
something out of it?

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.705
- Well everything's
a transaction.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:32.506
- Okay.

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:35.009
Transparency.

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:36.144
- Worst off.

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:38.546
- Why?

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:40.814
- Well, in my experience,

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.853
there's some things that

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.122
you just can't see

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.225
and maybe that's for the best.

01:08:50.227 --> 01:08:52.493
- What's the goal then?

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:54.028
- The goal?

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:57.298
The goal is accepting
that I'm alone.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.604
I spent so many years
of my life trying to

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:07.575
structure it so i
wouldn't feel alone but,

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.611
finally you can't own anything.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:10.845
Not really.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:14.182
So now I like to
look out at the ocean

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:21.189
and if somebody kind,
smart and attractive

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:26.694
was to spend some time
looking out with me,

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:29.296
well then that works too.

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:30.932
So you acclimate.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:35.970
- I don't know, i
think it's still sad somehow.

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:36.938
- Saddest
people are the ones

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.707
who don't know what they want.

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:00.595
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.003
What're you doing?

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:09.938
- Just hanging out.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.738
You have a good day?

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.507
- Yeah, I'm so tired.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:13.408
- Yeah.

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.377
How was it?

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:19.214
- It was good.

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.349
He's cool.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.318
You know, he has no bullshit.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.419
It was fun.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:26.454
The sunset was amazing.

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:28.456
- Were you guys safe?

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.257
- What?

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:30.458
- Were you safe?

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.293
- No no no, we
didn't do anything.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:33.628
- What did you do?

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.863
- We talk and
we got some drinks,

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.833
spent some time on
the boat, that's it.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.168
- Come on.
- What're you doing there?

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.135
- What?

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:42.670
- What are you doing here?

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:42.670
You okay?

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:45.106
- Yeah yeah, I'm
good, heading out.

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:46.007
- You sure?

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:47.575
- Yeah.
- Where?

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:49.677
- To see Paul.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.779
Call if you need
anything, alright?

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:52.714
- Okay.

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:53.781
- See you later.

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:55.516
- Okay bye.

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.721
- Bye.

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:09.757
- Oh, hello.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.059
What's up?

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:12.393
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:13.695
- I'm good, how are you?

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:15.263
- Good to
see you, Martin,

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:16.798
Claire, Martin, Claire.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.900
Claire is gabi's roommate.

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.234
- Oh cool hi.
- Know what's keeping

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:21.803
you guys all day.
- Oh hey.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.371
- What's up, what're
you doing tonight?

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:24.138
Just drinking?

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.640
- Yeah, hanging out.

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:26.474
- Your friends
coming, you just bye yourself?

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.942
- No I'm alone.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.111
- You said that so sad.

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:30.912
- No no.

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:32.814
I was having a night drink.

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.248
- You need a friend?

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:35.783
- Yeah yeah, if you wanna join.

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:35.783
- Do you wanna sit?

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:37.785
- No I'm meeting
up with the girls.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:38.986
Text me later.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:38.986
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:38.986
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.956
See you later.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:42.890
- What're you drinking?

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:42.890
And how drunk are you already?

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:47.462
- I'm not that
drunk, that's juice.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.831
- You know, gabi and i
aren't actually that close.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:51.499
We're only friends
because of Claire.

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:53.601
Well not only friends
because of Claire, but.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:54.969
- Really.

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:56.637
- And the guys are
really into gabi.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:58.005
It's kind of infuriating.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:58.806
- It's infuriating, really?

01:12:58.808 --> 01:12:59.974
- Yeah, extremely.

01:12:59.976 --> 01:12:59.974
- Because you have such trouble

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:02.176
with the guys, really?

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:03.978
- I'm selective.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.313
I'm picky.
- Selective, okay.

01:13:05.315 --> 01:13:07.448
What're you picky about?

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:10.985
- Tall, funny,

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:13.955
sensitive.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:16.657
- Alright.

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.793
- We should take shots.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:19.694
- Shots?

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:20.461
- That was very out of the blue,

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:21.863
but yes, we should.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:24.499
- Okay, alright.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:27.335
- Can we
please do shots?

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:44.485
- Should we wait
just a minute or something?

01:13:44.487 --> 01:13:45.787
- No.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:48.489
Do I have to open your
mouth and pour it down?

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:49.424
Yes!

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:53.394
I sound like a valley girl.

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:54.328
Good idea.

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:57.665
What's up?

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.135
- What?

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:02.470
- You just like do this thing

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:03.971
where you go off and
then you come back.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:05.506
It's kinda rude.

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:07.508
- I'm right here.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:08.910
- Come on tell me, what's wrong?

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:11.212
- Nothing is wrong.

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.581
- I see something
above your head

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:16.684
and it kinda looks
like a big black cloud.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:17.919
- No no,
nice try though.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:17.919
- Come on.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:21.255
Tell me what's up,
don't be a pussy.

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:22.190
- Don't be a pussy?

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:23.257
Really you think that's--

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:24.559
- man up.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:26.828
The dark cloud is
getting bigger.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.464
It's taking over the whole bar.

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:31.432
- No.

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:32.366
No.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:36.137
- You need another shot?

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.575
- My ex wife had this,

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.045
she had a miscarriage.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.581
A few years ago.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.116
- I'm sorry.

01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:50.051
- No, you don't
have to be sorry,

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:50.918
I'm not saying it for sympathy,

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.987
I'm just saying that,

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:59.760
this thing, we talked
about having kids

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:02.296
and obviously she was distraught

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:04.866
when it happened, of course,

01:15:04.868 --> 01:15:06.434
and then she asked
me how I was doing,

01:15:06.436 --> 01:15:09.770
and I realized I was
kind of relieved.

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.607
I lost it.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:16.077
I ran from everything.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:17.245
I ran from her.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.282
And school and
everything, but that's.

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:24.151
I just drove myself
crazy with all the

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:26.020
bad stuff I could be.

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.657
It was so simple, like now in
the back, it was so simple.

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:33.227
I just couldn't tell
her a simple truth.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.297
I wasn't ready.

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.967
I wasn't ready for any of that.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.569
Any of it.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.141
I couldn't say that to her so.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:56.417
The thing is I always
believed that she

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:59.954
when I was ready she
would be waiting for me,

01:15:59.956 --> 01:16:02.590
of course, she was the one who's

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.294
gonna love me most always.

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.164
And then like,

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:15.803
this morning I found
out she had a kid,

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:21.976
and I don't even,

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.146
that's great.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.350
It's great.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:39.827
- I did not mean to put you
in this situation, I'm sorry.

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:40.962
- It's fine.

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:45.199
Do you wanna get
another shot, or?

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.001
- I'm okay.

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:47.935
I'm sorry.

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:51.339
It's just that,

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:55.209
I don't think I'm the
right person to tell.

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.311
I'm gonna go.

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.349
See you soon.

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:02.283
Bye.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.234
- Hey gabi.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.204
Gabi, hey.

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.375
Babe, are you awake?

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:30.544
Hey.

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:32.480
Hey.

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:37.718
Can we talk real fast?
- Hi.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.953
I'm sleeping.

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:42.189
- I know, but i
need to talk to you.

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.691
- In the morning.

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:45.526
- No, baby, please now.

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:47.194
- Come, come in here.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:49.630
- I know, but can we talk first?

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:50.564
Please?

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.435
- Come.

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:57.104
I want to spoon you.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.790
Hi, how are you?

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:16.724
- Hi.

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:17.792
- What's you're name?

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:19.060
- Angelica.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:20.561
- My name is
gabi, nice to meet you.

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:21.962
- Yes, well we actually

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:23.264
frequent this place quite often.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:24.231
- Really?
- There's a particular fish

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:25.733
that we like to see.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:28.803
- You have to
show me the best places.

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:30.337
- This one guy,

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:33.808
he's like a sort of
dragon of sorts, isn't he?

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:39.747
Well here's my favorite guy.

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:41.248
- They look like spots,

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.317
like these different
little spots.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.278
- Ah shit!

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.447
Oh you're in
fucking trouble now.

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:16.117
Oh you're in so much trouble.

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:19.353
Man down!

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:21.021
No no no!

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.294
- Do you like my part?

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.596
- Yeah.

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:39.440
This is a baby diary, day one.

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.246
- There is a baby.

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:46.547
- Yeah.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.816
It's that big already.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:53.254
- I'm gonna be
like that pretty soon.

01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:55.422
- I'm gonna love you.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.625
I'm gonna love you so much.

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.027
I felt it, it kicked.

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.695
- Really?
- It kicked.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:03.597
Oh yeah, it's gonna
be a little fighter.

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:08.669
- What a little lush.

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:11.305
Drunk on pizza and milkshake.

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.910
There's some wine if you want.

01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:17.611
I'll get some rioja.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:18.546
- Okay.

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:19.613
- And some cabernet,

01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:20.915
you chose one if you like.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:21.849
- Okay.

01:20:21.851 --> 01:20:22.917
- And the decanter.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.652
- Don't worry, okay.

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.137
Is she asleep?

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:25.946
Wow, oh.

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:29.550
- G.
- G, yes.

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:31.485
Gina?

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:35.489
- Gina, yes, every girlfriend
i have begins with a g.

01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:36.290
- Greta?

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:37.591
- Greta.

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.361
- It's very nice,

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:42.329
I mean you don't have
to give me anything.

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:43.931
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.599
- No no, I'm not upset.

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:48.502
I like it a lot,
thank you so much.

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:48.969
- I like you.

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:53.908
- And I like you.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:22.903
- Hey.

01:22:22.905 --> 01:22:24.471
- Hey.

01:22:24.473 --> 01:22:26.407
What're you doing home?

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.008
- I called in here today.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:29.977
- Oh, are you sick?

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:31.812
- No, just needed it.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.883
- We can spend
the morning together.

01:22:35.885 --> 01:22:37.151
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.696
You gonna tell me what happened?

01:22:48.698 --> 01:22:49.663
- Yesterday?

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:50.998
- Mm-hm.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.535
- Nothing, we
went to the aquarium

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:59.039
with his daughter,
she's super sweet.

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:01.842
She's so cute, she's amazing.

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:03.510
And then we went to his place

01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:05.279
and then we opened some wine

01:23:05.281 --> 01:23:07.815
and we got a little bit drunk.

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.088
- And that was it?

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:15.723
- No, we had sex.

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:21.729
- Did you cum?

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:26.667
- Yeah.

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:31.572
You okay?

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.109
Sure?

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:17.451
- Fuck.

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.660
When are you gonna
see him again?

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:40.474
Alright.

01:24:40.476 --> 01:24:41.809
- I'm having a

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:44.912
a dinner at my house

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.548
a weekend after the next,

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:50.050
I was wondering if
you were around,

01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:51.852
you might wanna come.

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:54.188
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:24:54.190 --> 01:24:55.522
- Maybe yeah.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.063
I have to check with Martin.

01:25:03.065 --> 01:25:05.866
I don't know if we are
gonna do something.

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:07.334
Okay, maybe I come.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:12.272
- Does,

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.009
does he wear protection?

01:25:16.011 --> 01:25:17.311
- Martin?

01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:18.212
No.

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:26.220
- I'd like it if
he did, you know.

01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:35.662
- Martin is my boyfriend.

01:25:35.664 --> 01:25:36.964
- And what am I?

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:40.367
- You're my boat man.

01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:41.168
- Your boat man.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.069
- Oh shit.

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:44.438
- Oh no,
not another cramp.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.372
- Yeah.

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:48.041
That's it, that's it.

01:25:48.043 --> 01:25:48.942
- Cold feet.

01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:51.044
- Yeah, cold feet.

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:53.981
- Warm heart.

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:33.654
- She, she told me
about all of his ex wife drama,

01:26:33.656 --> 01:26:35.656
I didn't even know
he had an ex wife so.

01:26:35.658 --> 01:26:36.823
- What drama?

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.625
He has an ex wife, so what?

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:40.460
- She implied that there were

01:26:40.462 --> 01:26:42.629
maybe regrets and issues.

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:44.431
It just seemed like there
was a lot of baggage.

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:47.768
- That he had issues
with his ex wife?

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:49.937
- What do you think?

01:26:49.939 --> 01:26:51.238
Is there any issues

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.439
between you guys?
- No of course not,

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:54.641
but why is he talking
about to Blake?

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:54.641
- I don't know.

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:58.011
- Why is Blake talking
about that to you?

01:26:58.013 --> 01:27:00.714
- I think you need to ask him.

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.455
You okay?
- Yeah.

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:11.992
- Wanna watch a
movie or something?

01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:12.793
- What?

01:27:12.795 --> 01:27:15.495
- Wanna watch a movie?

01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:17.164
- No, you go, you go,

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:18.398
you watch it.

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:29.836
You are constantly on my mind,

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:32.706
anything I think or do
is just a reflection

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:34.741
of our time together
and that makes me

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:36.910
miss you constantly.
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:38.045
Hey.

01:28:38.047 --> 01:28:39.379
- I think of--

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.382
- you can't go
through my fucking shit.

01:28:42.384 --> 01:28:43.717
- Why did
you message her?

01:28:43.719 --> 01:28:45.419
What is going on?

01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:46.920
Why are you missing her?

01:28:46.922 --> 01:28:48.789
Because you care, all the time.

01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:50.123
- My fucking
personal shit.

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:51.224
You shouldn't go through it.

01:28:51.226 --> 01:28:52.125
- It's your shit?
- Yes.

01:28:52.127 --> 01:28:53.727
- It's your fucking shit?

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:55.696
You have to talk to me about
your fucking shit, okay?

01:28:55.698 --> 01:28:55.696
- I don't need to
talk to you about it?

01:28:55.698 --> 01:28:58.031
It's my fucking business!
- Why are you not open

01:28:58.033 --> 01:28:58.932
about her?
- I tried.

01:28:58.934 --> 01:28:59.933
I tried to fucking talk to you.

01:28:59.935 --> 01:28:59.933
- When you try?

01:28:59.935 --> 01:29:01.702
When you try?

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:01.702
When?

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:01.702
When?
- Gabi please.

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:05.272
Don't fucking start this,
you fucking can't go

01:29:05.274 --> 01:29:06.106
through that shit.
- No tell me, when you try?

01:29:06.108 --> 01:29:07.441
- No no.

01:29:07.443 --> 01:29:07.441
- You are not talk
to me about that.

01:29:07.443 --> 01:29:09.876
- You know what we
need to fucking talk about?

01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:11.211
Let's talk about this.

01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:12.779
- Okay, I didn't know
how to react to that.

01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:13.714
- You didn't
know how to react to this,

01:29:13.716 --> 01:29:13.714
but you didn't have a problem

01:29:13.716 --> 01:29:13.714
fucking accepting it, did you?

01:29:13.716 --> 01:29:17.150
You didn't have a problem
fucking keeping it, did you?

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:18.385
Is this from him, huh?

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:19.619
You can tell me about it, gabi,

01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:20.987
you can tell me all about this,

01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:21.788
because that's how we work.

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:22.956
That's how this works,

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.124
that's how we work, please.

01:29:24.126 --> 01:29:25.826
Tell me about this
fucking necklace

01:29:25.828 --> 01:29:27.094
you got given, please.

01:29:27.096 --> 01:29:28.795
Because I don't fucking
know about that.

01:29:28.797 --> 01:29:29.830
- It's just a fucking necklace.

01:29:29.832 --> 01:29:30.897
- Do you love him?

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:31.665
- No!

01:29:31.667 --> 01:29:32.599
No, do you love her?

01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:33.333
- No, I don't fucking love her,

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:34.301
she's in the past.

01:29:34.303 --> 01:29:35.902
- She's a fucking ghost!

01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:37.337
She's a fucking
ghost inside of you.

01:29:37.339 --> 01:29:38.638
- She's not a fucking ghost.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:38.638
- She's fucking here.
- She's not a ghost

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.275
- she's fucking here.
- She's in the past, gabi!

01:29:42.277 --> 01:29:44.511
She's not, she's here!
- Get the fuck off me.

01:29:44.513 --> 01:29:46.480
Do you think i
wanted any of this?

01:29:46.482 --> 01:29:47.848
Do you think I want any of this?

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:50.684
Knowing you're with
another guy half the time?

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:52.152
You're with another fucking guy

01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:54.254
because you're so
fucking self entitled,

01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:55.155
you knew I loved you,

01:29:55.157 --> 01:29:56.490
so you fucking drag me along

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:58.191
for your fucking games.

01:29:58.193 --> 01:29:59.826
I didn't want any of this!

01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:00.994
- You didn't?

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:01.795
- No!

01:30:01.797 --> 01:30:02.863
- You fucking most--

01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:04.664
- entitled.
- Self deceptive person

01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:05.966
I've ever met.
- Yeah and you're the most

01:30:05.968 --> 01:30:09.536
self destructive, so i
guess we're even right?

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:33.627
Fuck.

01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:07.227
I don't know.

01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:08.995
I guess she went home.

01:31:08.997 --> 01:31:09.896
Or,

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:16.303
she might've moved in with him.

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.972
- I'm sorry, man.

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:24.377
You know my grandparents
were together for 57 years.

01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:26.046
The night that i
proposed to Quinn,

01:31:26.048 --> 01:31:27.781
I called them up, my grandpa,

01:31:27.783 --> 01:31:31.017
and I asked him what
the, what the secret was

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:32.719
and he kinda thought about it

01:31:32.721 --> 01:31:34.955
for a real long time actually

01:31:34.957 --> 01:31:38.091
and then he said,
love is two people

01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:42.262
who don't give up on each other.

01:31:42.264 --> 01:31:43.196
Simple as that.

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:45.265
- You're saying it's a choice?

01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:48.034
- I feel like if you
think too hard about it,

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.937
you're just kinda complicating
it and fucking it up.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:52.439
You gotta stop thinking.

01:31:52.441 --> 01:31:54.774
And you gotta get your
broke ass phone fixed.

01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:57.143
Or get a fax machine
or something.

01:31:57.145 --> 01:31:58.144
Get a beeper.

01:31:58.146 --> 01:31:59.713
- I would love a beeper.

01:31:59.715 --> 01:32:01.281
I think that's more
my vibe, you know.

01:32:01.283 --> 01:32:02.215
- You'd
look good with one,

01:32:02.217 --> 01:32:05.285
it'd complete your look, man.

01:32:05.287 --> 01:32:06.520
- Fuck.

01:32:06.522 --> 01:32:08.288
I don't know, whatever
will be will be.

01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:09.322
- No man.

01:32:09.324 --> 01:32:12.092
No, see, for love to work

01:32:12.094 --> 01:32:12.092
and for happiness to work

01:32:12.094 --> 01:32:14.995
and for you to wanna
have a family some day,

01:32:14.997 --> 01:32:17.864
you have to actually pursue it.

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:22.969
You know, don't
leave it up to fate.

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:34.147
- Hey.

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.147
- Morning.

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:38.251
- Oh my god, you're
a early bird, right?

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.654
Is your daddy up?

01:32:40.656 --> 01:32:42.489
- No, not yet.
- Not yet?

01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:44.424
Do you wanna start
breakfast for him?

01:32:44.426 --> 01:32:45.325
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

01:32:45.327 --> 01:32:46.459
You help me?

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:57.737
Oh my god.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:32:59.906
He's coming.

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:01.875
You can't look yet.

01:33:01.877 --> 01:33:02.776
- Oh my god, what's going on?

01:33:02.778 --> 01:33:03.543
- You cannot come yet.

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:04.544
Stop him.

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:05.779
Stop him.

01:33:05.781 --> 01:33:07.447
- No no!
- I won't look, I won't look.

01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:09.182
- Stop him.

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:13.219
- Did you,

01:33:13.221 --> 01:33:14.854
did you have any
dreams last night?

01:33:14.856 --> 01:33:15.789
- Yeah.

01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:17.357
I was in another dimension

01:33:17.359 --> 01:33:18.925
and it was 2040.

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:22.696
- Wow.

01:33:22.698 --> 01:33:24.297
- And then I was like.

01:33:24.299 --> 01:33:26.700
And then I saw my future self.

01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:28.034
- Wow.

01:33:28.036 --> 01:33:30.136
- Yeah, and I was
like who are you?

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:34.341
And then my future self
was like, who are you?

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:39.212
Can I play on my iPad?

01:33:39.214 --> 01:33:41.047
- Yeah, sure you can.

01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:42.015
Don't get the iPad sticky

01:33:42.017 --> 01:33:43.550
with all the maple syrup.

01:33:43.552 --> 01:33:45.251
Can you wash your hands first?

01:33:45.253 --> 01:33:46.052
Yeah?

01:33:46.054 --> 01:33:47.721
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:33:47.723 --> 01:33:48.855
See you later.

01:33:48.857 --> 01:33:50.056
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.431
I've been meaning
to tell you that

01:33:58.433 --> 01:34:00.066
I have this offer

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:02.569
that would take me to
Europe for a while.

01:34:02.571 --> 01:34:03.370
- Really?

01:34:03.372 --> 01:34:04.170
- Yeah.

01:34:04.172 --> 01:34:05.405
- For work?

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.908
- Munich, Milan, and Barcelona.

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.244
- That's good.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.081
Barcelona's good.

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:16.249
How long?

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:18.284
- A year, two years.

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:20.053
Depending on how things go.

01:34:20.055 --> 01:34:21.354
- A year or two?

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:24.057
That's a long time.

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:27.927
What're you gonna do with Angie?

01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:28.895
- Angie's gonna come.

01:34:28.897 --> 01:34:30.130
- Really?

01:34:30.132 --> 01:34:31.364
Yeah?
- Managed to convince her

01:34:31.366 --> 01:34:32.732
mother that it
would be a mistake

01:34:32.734 --> 01:34:34.634
not to allow her this
kind of opportunity.

01:34:34.636 --> 01:34:37.237
Her brain is like a
little sponge right now.

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:38.171
- Yeah.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.473
Yeah.

01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:41.908
No, it's so good
for kids to travel.

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:44.911
They learn other
languages and cultures.

01:34:44.913 --> 01:34:45.979
- Yeah.

01:34:45.981 --> 01:34:48.348
- She's lucky to have you.

01:34:52.486 --> 01:34:54.554
- I'd like you to come.

01:34:57.591 --> 01:35:01.795
You could spend time with
your family, your friends.

01:35:01.797 --> 01:35:04.297
We can make new ones together.

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:06.566
- Yeah.

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:10.303
It's like, I don't know,

01:35:10.305 --> 01:35:10.303
because I have my job here,

01:35:10.305 --> 01:35:14.641
my friends, I have like
this whole life down here.

01:35:14.643 --> 01:35:15.775
- We could
have a life there.

01:35:15.777 --> 01:35:16.976
- Yeah.

01:35:16.978 --> 01:35:19.012
- Yeah.

01:35:19.014 --> 01:35:19.946
- Yeah.

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:23.483
When is this happening?

01:35:23.485 --> 01:35:25.452
- Two weeks.

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.189
These are the best

01:35:29.191 --> 01:35:32.325
soft scrambled
eggs I've ever had.

01:35:32.327 --> 01:35:34.260
What did you do to them?

01:35:34.262 --> 01:35:37.097
- It's like the details.

01:35:37.099 --> 01:35:38.198
- All the details.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:38.998
- Yeah.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:39.933
- I gotta make a call.

01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:41.267
- Okay.

01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:25.178
- Okay.

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:27.347
- That's why i
don't think they're right.

01:36:27.349 --> 01:36:28.381
- Okay.

01:36:28.383 --> 01:36:29.816
Excuse me, I'll be one second.

01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:34.587
Pharmacy.

01:36:34.589 --> 01:36:36.456
- Martin?

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.660
- Hey.

01:36:40.662 --> 01:36:41.561
- Hey, sorry,

01:36:41.563 --> 01:36:43.930
I didn't know you were at work.

01:36:43.932 --> 01:36:46.199
- Yeah, no no, it's good.

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:46.866
How are you?

01:36:46.868 --> 01:36:49.068
- I got your email,

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:50.270
I thought about
emailing back but,

01:36:50.272 --> 01:36:53.339
I thought it'd be
better if we spoke.

01:36:53.341 --> 01:36:55.942
I asked Quinn for this number.

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:03.216
- Always flip your car over.

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:07.954
- Daddy.

01:37:07.956 --> 01:37:09.255
- Oh hi, honey.

01:37:09.257 --> 01:37:12.091
- The
TV isn't playing.

01:37:12.093 --> 01:37:13.259
- Gabi, can you?

01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:14.360
- Yeah, sure.

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:15.728
- Thank you so much.

01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:17.797
It was the other time

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:18.965
when he was in New York

01:37:18.967 --> 01:37:21.835
and he followed all the steps.
- Hey.

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.470
What's going on with the TV?

01:37:24.472 --> 01:37:28.074
- I tried but, all
it did was go red.

01:37:28.076 --> 01:37:31.411
- Okay, let's see.
- That's all it did.

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:34.013
- What about?

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.382
- That's what
i was talking about!

01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:39.085
That's what I was talking about.

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:45.758
- Okay.

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.264
- This is Blake.
- Blake, nice to meet you.

01:37:51.266 --> 01:37:54.834
- Does a lot of
great legal work for us.

01:37:54.836 --> 01:37:57.203
- Blake, nice to meet you.

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:01.241
- Yeah, it's
great to have Blake here.

01:38:01.243 --> 01:38:03.176
Would you like a glass of wine?

01:38:03.178 --> 01:38:04.444
- Yeah.
- Cocktail?

01:38:04.446 --> 01:38:05.612
- Wine's great.

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:09.482
- Hey!

01:38:09.484 --> 01:38:10.583
Hey hey hey hey.

01:38:10.585 --> 01:38:12.986
Hey, where're you going?

01:38:12.988 --> 01:38:14.120
- Why is she here?

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:15.021
- She works with me,

01:38:15.023 --> 01:38:16.322
I thought you guys were friends.

01:38:16.324 --> 01:38:17.657
- I want her out.

01:38:17.659 --> 01:38:18.925
- Come on, don't be
silly, she is here.

01:38:18.927 --> 01:38:20.026
- No I want her out right now.

01:38:20.028 --> 01:38:21.327
- No.

01:38:21.329 --> 01:38:22.495
- I just want her
to leave right now,

01:38:22.497 --> 01:38:23.997
I'm right here with this.

01:38:23.999 --> 01:38:25.498
- I'm not kicking her out.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.333
Now stop being like
a fucking teenager,

01:38:27.335 --> 01:38:29.102
okay, you're embarrassing
yourself and me.

01:38:29.104 --> 01:38:30.003
- Okay.

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:45.818
- Me and
Martin we only talked,

01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.153
we just talked okay?

01:38:47.155 --> 01:38:48.354
You should know that,
you should know that.

01:38:48.356 --> 01:38:49.689
I don't care what
you're doing with Larry.

01:38:49.691 --> 01:38:51.224
Talk to me for a second.

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.004
- Thank you.

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.213
It's good to see you, Martin.

01:41:27.215 --> 01:41:29.282
- Yeah, you too.

01:41:29.284 --> 01:41:31.551
Congratulations again,

01:41:31.553 --> 01:41:32.351
on the baby.

01:41:32.353 --> 01:41:33.286
- Oh yeah.

01:41:33.288 --> 01:41:36.355
Yeah, it was a
surprise, definitely.

01:41:36.357 --> 01:41:37.723
But it was the best thing

01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:39.058
that's ever happened to me.

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:39.992
- Yeah?

01:41:39.994 --> 01:41:42.128
- I know that sounds cliche but,

01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:43.062
but it's true.

01:41:43.064 --> 01:41:44.897
- No, it's not, it's not cliche,

01:41:44.899 --> 01:41:46.866
I mean if it wasn't.

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:51.671
What's his name?

01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:52.839
- Dylan.

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:56.576
Yeah, I know.

01:41:56.578 --> 01:41:58.177
- It's a good name.

01:41:59.079 --> 01:41:59.979
Like Bob.

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:04.684
- I wanted to see you in person

01:42:04.686 --> 01:42:06.986
to tell you I'm sorry.

01:42:06.988 --> 01:42:08.421
I'm sorry, Martin.

01:42:08.423 --> 01:42:09.722
- You don't have to say that,

01:42:09.724 --> 01:42:09.722
you have nothing
to be sorry about.

01:42:09.724 --> 01:42:11.591
I'm the one,

01:42:11.593 --> 01:42:14.093
I should apologize.
- For blaming you.

01:42:14.095 --> 01:42:15.528
That was unfair of me.

01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:17.864
It wasn't your fault or mine.

01:42:17.866 --> 01:42:20.833
We were just kids playing house.

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.771
- Are you happy?

01:42:25.773 --> 01:42:26.706
- I am.

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:30.910
But you know what
the funny thing is,

01:42:33.046 --> 01:42:35.081
it's not very exciting.

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:37.717
It's kinda boring,

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.753
predictable.

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:46.159
I don't know, maybe
that's just adulthood.

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:49.729
Are you happy?

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:56.569
Are you happy?

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:00.806
You're seeing someone.

01:43:00.808 --> 01:43:02.742
You have a girlfriend?

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.178
- No.

01:43:10.384 --> 01:43:11.150
Can I see Dylan?

01:43:11.152 --> 01:43:13.119
Do you have any photos?

01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:15.121
- Yeah, sure.

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:21.494
- Oh my god.

01:43:21.496 --> 01:43:22.762
He is--

01:43:22.764 --> 01:43:23.563
- he's very alert.

01:43:23.565 --> 01:43:25.631
Always amazed looking

01:43:25.633 --> 01:43:28.768
and he was fat, like obese.
- Oh no.

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:31.938
Oh my god.

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:34.307
- Look at his arms.

01:43:34.309 --> 01:43:36.842
- He was chunky, right.

01:43:36.844 --> 01:43:38.744
- He's my heart.

01:43:38.746 --> 01:43:40.813
- He's so cute.

01:43:40.815 --> 01:43:44.250
I'm really, really
happy for you, that's.

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:50.423
- Yeah.

01:43:50.425 --> 01:43:52.825
You should go back to work.

01:43:54.194 --> 01:43:56.696
- Thank you for making
time to stop by.

01:43:56.698 --> 01:43:58.764
It's good to see you.

01:43:58.766 --> 01:44:00.099
- Thank you for the water.

01:44:00.101 --> 01:44:02.602
- It's la's finest.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.115
- You consider my offer?

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.153
You know I'm leaving soon,

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:55.988
it's be nice to know.

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.762
- You don't think
we have to talk first?

01:45:02.764 --> 01:45:03.929
- About what?

01:45:03.931 --> 01:45:06.866
- About
yesterday, last night?

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:12.405
- Well, the way that I see it,

01:45:12.407 --> 01:45:13.773
I invited some friends,

01:45:13.775 --> 01:45:15.908
you felt out of place,
then Blake arrived

01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:20.513
and for some reason you
went a little crazy and,

01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:22.782
I'm fine with that but,

01:45:22.784 --> 01:45:24.850
beyond that I'm really
not all that interested,

01:45:24.852 --> 01:45:26.752
no I'm not in all honesty.

01:45:26.754 --> 01:45:29.522
- You don't wanna know what
i was doing last night?

01:45:29.524 --> 01:45:30.856
- We can run around
in circles here.

01:45:30.858 --> 01:45:33.225
Help me help you,
what is it you need?

01:45:33.227 --> 01:45:34.894
- Why you don't
take me seriously?

01:45:34.896 --> 01:45:35.961
- Seriously?

01:45:35.963 --> 01:45:37.697
- Yeah.

01:45:37.699 --> 01:45:39.565
- This entire relationship
was based upon me

01:45:39.567 --> 01:45:42.234
not taking you seriously.

01:45:42.236 --> 01:45:45.905
It's how you
introduced yourself.

01:45:45.907 --> 01:45:45.905
It's what you are.

01:45:45.907 --> 01:45:51.444
By your actions, it's
what your proving to be.

01:45:51.446 --> 01:45:53.679
I'm fine with that, okay?

01:45:56.983 --> 01:46:00.319
Do you wanna know how an
adult relationship works?

01:46:00.321 --> 01:46:02.121
Do you want me to
be transparent?

01:46:02.123 --> 01:46:04.056
This is a transaction.

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.259
I give you a necklace,

01:46:07.261 --> 01:46:10.229
you look at the ocean with me.

01:46:10.231 --> 01:46:12.131
I give you a place to stay,

01:46:12.133 --> 01:46:13.899
you play Patty cakes
with my daughter

01:46:13.901 --> 01:46:16.035
and you sleep in my bed.

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:17.837
We go to Europe
and you spend time

01:46:17.839 --> 01:46:19.638
with your friends, your family

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.475
and we live like
fucking royalty.

01:46:23.977 --> 01:46:27.413
And you spare me whatever
perverted bullshit

01:46:27.415 --> 01:46:30.049
you have to do in order to feel

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:33.619
somehow whole.

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:40.426
You want transparency?

01:46:40.428 --> 01:46:42.828
You got transparency, okay?

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.347
I'm sorry, that was harsh.

01:47:01.349 --> 01:47:02.681
- That's okay.

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:12.992
I get what you want,

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:18.664
but I think you
are wrong about me.

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:23.035
I think you don't
care to know me

01:47:23.037 --> 01:47:25.438
and you don't know me at all.

01:47:27.207 --> 01:47:28.207
- Okay let's talk.

01:47:28.209 --> 01:47:29.008
- No.

01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:30.342
No, I mean.

01:47:30.344 --> 01:47:34.647
We say sometimes things
we don't mean actually,

01:47:34.649 --> 01:47:37.516
but I think you don't
care to know me at all,

01:47:37.518 --> 01:47:40.853
to know if you mean it or not.

01:47:40.855 --> 01:47:44.123
It's easy or nothing
with you, right?

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:47.393
It's okay.

01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:52.364
You have your whole
life all set, right?

01:47:52.366 --> 01:47:53.299
It's done.

01:47:56.603 --> 01:48:00.506
I have not even started
mine and I don't know,

01:48:02.409 --> 01:48:03.943
I don't know how
I'm gonna do it,

01:48:03.945 --> 01:48:06.178
but I'm gonna start mine.

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:13.018
And I don't wanna
do it with you.

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:36.368
I think I want
something of my own now.

01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:38.604
I want something serious.

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.775
I thought I didn't want it,

01:49:42.777 --> 01:49:44.176
but I do want it.

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:59.692
I don't know if I deserve it,

01:49:59.694 --> 01:50:01.694
but I want to try it,

01:50:01.696 --> 01:50:04.163
and I think that
if I try it hard,

01:50:04.165 --> 01:50:06.465
maybe I find a way with you.

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:14.173
Because when we're
together, it was magic.

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:26.118
You say something.

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.925
- It just can't be how it was.

01:50:32.927 --> 01:50:35.194
- I know, I know.

01:50:35.196 --> 01:50:36.061
- You do?

01:50:36.063 --> 01:50:37.563
- Yeah.

01:50:37.565 --> 01:50:41.000
If I say it, I know, I do know.

01:50:41.002 --> 01:50:45.337
I don't want it like before,
i don't want it like before.

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:51.176
- You know when i
said I was in before,

01:50:53.013 --> 01:50:53.912
I wasn't,

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:56.181
not all of me.

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:01.253
I was afraid but.

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.592
I really want you, only you.

01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:11.263
- I want you.

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:28.380
I think we're,

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:34.019
we're going to get
bored of each other.

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:36.121
- That's okay.

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.793
You know, bored is okay.

01:51:40.795 --> 01:51:44.129
- We're going to
resent each other, too.

01:51:44.131 --> 01:51:48.200
- We'll remind each
other why we're worth it.

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:55.307
- I will disappoint you.

01:51:55.309 --> 01:51:57.276
- I will disappoint you.

01:51:57.278 --> 01:51:59.244
- You promise?

01:51:59.246 --> 01:52:00.112
- Yes.

01:52:00.114 --> 01:52:01.280
- You promise me.

01:52:01.282 --> 01:52:03.248
- I promise you.
