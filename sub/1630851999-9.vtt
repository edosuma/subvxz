WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.921
I still think it's an epic fail you're
spending this much energy on the past.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.757
When will you accept
your relationship with Marco is over?

00:07.841 --> 00:08.717
PREVIOUSLY

00:08.800 --> 00:11.886
Our relationship isn't over. You destroyed
it. And I swear you will regret it.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.597
And you too.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.350
[Cocó] Ahem.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.560
Cocó--

00:19.060 --> 00:20.520
Your relationship with Caterina

00:20.603 --> 00:23.648
could have grave consequences for you
and your career.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.234
Or it could be a great opportunity.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.154
[Diego] What if you came on tour with us?

00:29.237 --> 00:30.363
My mom sent you.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.116
-Listen to me. It's not what you--
-Get out.

00:34.659 --> 00:39.372
[Allegra] <i>Cocó, Greta, Tomás,</i>
<i>Diego, Marco…</i>

00:40.248 --> 00:42.250
They all seem like pieces of the puzzle,

00:42.334 --> 00:44.544
but I don't understand
how they fit together yet.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.879
It was that girl Laura's fault.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.714
<i>If she hadn't been there…</i>

00:47.797 --> 00:49.174
What happened with that girl?

00:49.257 --> 00:50.633
That night, Laura died.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.021
INTERTWINED

01:03.855 --> 01:07.400
We still don't know what happened
on opening day. I have to save Marco.

01:07.484 --> 01:11.863
Okay. There it is. I think you
have to get your priorities in order, no?

01:11.946 --> 01:17.869
You have to save yourself. Greta said that
you were at the theater on opening night.

01:17.952 --> 01:22.499
No. I wasn't there yet.
Lucía said that time has rules.

She tried to bring Eusebio
with her to her time, and he died.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.051
Eusebio? Who's that?

01:33.134 --> 01:34.552
The love of Lucía's life.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.222
I don't want the same thing
to happen to Marco.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.933
Well, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.853
I have to take advantage of the last trip.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.314
There's still time to change
what happened.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.775
That night destroyed the theater
and my family.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.444
Were you able to find Dante?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.781
Yes. Yes.
He works at Indiana, the record label.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.908
Dante? Are you sure?

01:56.991 --> 01:58.034
Yes, it's him.

01:58.118 --> 02:02.080
I messaged him at the office.
I messaged him on social media, but--

02:02.163 --> 02:05.667
I doubt he's going to answer you.
He must think you're a crazy stalker.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.460
-[door opens, creaks]

02:07.544 --> 02:10.130

-[Félix] The, a…
-[Allegra] Uh, a…

02:12.590 --> 02:14.926
-A character in my short.
-Yes.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.470
-You found it. Thank you.
-Yes.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.099
Yes, the only thing is
I don't know if these are the cables…

02:21.182 --> 02:23.810
I'll take care of it later.
Thank you. That's fine.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.603
Hmm.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.688
Mmm.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.567
Ma, your food is burning, no?

02:32.152 --> 02:35.030
-Yes. My food is burning.
-[Allegra] Yeah.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.868
-See you later.
-See you later.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.453
[footsteps departing]

02:43.955 --> 02:47.584
-What if we go to the theater tomorrow?
-No. I can't. I have to rehearse.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.253
But it's at night.
We'll rehearse together tomorrow.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.131
I don't want to rehearse for the audition.
I want to prepare for the short.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.217
All right. Enough excuses.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.887
Yesterday you couldn't because
you were tired. Today you can't either.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.097
That's right.
I was exhausted after recording all day.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.515
But you went out with my brother.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.642
I didn't go out with your brother.
I went out with the team.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.103
There was a really great vibe
while we were filming.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.189
I don't understand why
you're giving so much importance

03:09.272 --> 03:11.191
to a student short no one is going to see.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.860
Allegra isn't in your way. Your spot
at Eleven O'Clock is a sure thing.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.362
You should put your energy
into the company.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.322
It doesn't make sense
to waste energy on the play.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.285
I'm never going to be able to be
the actress my mom expects me to be.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.372
Because she wants me to be
just like her, and that's impossible.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.835
I think it's best to make my own way.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.838
In a short by a high school newbie?

03:48.311 --> 03:53.400
It's Sofía. She has some suggestions
to change the short's script.

-[scoffs] She's a playwright now too?
-[Félix sighs]

03:55.819 --> 03:59.864
I don't know. She says she doesn't agree
that her character should die

03:59.948 --> 04:02.909
and that it would be good
if she came back to life.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.328
I don't understand.
She wants to be a zombie?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.455
I don't know. She hasn't
fully explained the idea to me.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.790
-No, but I can't believe you.
-[beeps]

04:08.873 --> 04:12.502
Who does she think she is to have
an opinion and destroy your script?

04:12.585 --> 04:15.005
[chuckles] She's the lead in my short.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.548
[Félix sighs]

04:16.631 --> 04:18.925
That doesn't give her the right
to question your story.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.469
It doesn't hurt to hear her ideas, eh?

04:21.553 --> 04:25.181
And at least she, I don't know, doesn't
abandon me with my projects, right?

04:25.265 --> 04:28.685
Ay, please. Stop torturing me.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.104
I know I'm the worst friend in the world.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.981
Yes. Yes, you are.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.442
And you know what else you are?
A very good actress.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.527
Even when you're not acting, I would say.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.283
You may not be the lead
in my horror short,

04:43.366 --> 04:46.119
but you are the lead in my mockumentary.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.412
Mocku-- what?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.789
It's like a fake documentary.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.752
It's going to be about a movie director
who wants to film his movie,

04:53.835 --> 04:56.713
but his lead never arrives on time.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.214
Sound familiar?

No? [chuckles] Look.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.222
I was so concentrated on the past that…

I ended up neglecting
the most important thing.

And how's it going with that? Mmm?

The last audition for <i>Freaky Friday</i>

06:12.038 --> 06:13.498
Yes, but it's a done deal.

Mom isn't going to let me audition,

to tell you.

you met with Mike instead?

Why do you say that?
Mike and I are old friends.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.460
Yes, that's true.

Also, he's one of the biggest producers

If you don't let me go out,

07:14.893 --> 07:16.811
Oh, yeah? You're going to tell him?

what I talked to him about.

I tried, but your mom
doesn't want to listen to me.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.065
If I could go back in time…

08:45.442 --> 08:47.652
there are so many things
I would do differently.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.739
Do you mean because of
the opening of <i>Freaky Friday</i> in '94?

08:51.823 --> 08:53.408
Why do you ask that?

08:54.743 --> 08:55.744
I don't know.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.080
Mom said she lost everything that night.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.167
She lost you.

That was the best
and the worst night of my life.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.473
Caterina was never able to understand me.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.767
[scoffs]
And were you able to understand her?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.604
What happened can't be changed.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.439
But I would like to think

09:25.190 --> 09:30.153
that there's still time
to change other things.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.909

Bye.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.279
Do you think I'll be able to publish
my novel when I finish writing it?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.907
-[door closes]
-Why are you worried about that right now?

10:15.990 --> 10:19.202
Well, I don't know.
Isn't that what we all want?

10:19.285 --> 10:21.538
Don't we write
so others will read what we wrote?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.748
Writing is one thing,

10:24.582 --> 10:28.795
and being a professional writer
is something else entirely.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.883
We are not writers only
when our books are on the bookshelves.

10:33.967 --> 10:38.263
There are great writers
that have never published a single book

10:38.346 --> 10:42.642
because they consider the act of writing
to be extremely intimate.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.770
And I share that idea somewhat.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.480
You still have time.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.317
Think hard about what kind of life
you want to live

10:51.401 --> 10:53.820
before publishing your first book.

10:55.447 --> 10:59.868
You can be a great writer
with just a piece of paper…

11:00.994 --> 11:02.078
and a pen.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.581
For me?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.375
So you don't forget your path.

11:09.711 --> 11:14.382
You have to do something
to change that unbearable mood you're in.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.218
I lost the part of Ellie.
How else am I going to be?

11:17.844 --> 11:21.431
Do you want us to go to Laura's house
and yell things at her so she can't sleep?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.642
Or play music really loud?
Or we can egg her house.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.437
Well, at least you laughed.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.148
I can go to Tomás' office
and get her information

11:30.231 --> 11:32.359
to find out her address.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.652
Because we don't know where Laura lives.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.988
We don't know anything about Laura.
[chuckles]

11:38.323 --> 11:40.200
Of course. We don't know where she lives…

12:03.139 --> 12:04.140
Let's see.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.601
[chattering]

12:06.685 --> 12:08.228
Good. Excellent. Excellent.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.773
-Sofi, that was great.
-And how was I? Good, no?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.942
You have room for improvement.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.862
Allegra, you came. We just finished.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.489
Yes. We were just leaving, right?

12:19.572 --> 12:22.534
Too bad you didn't get here in time.
Félix is a great director.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.244
Don't exaggerate.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.914
-Time will tell, no?
-Don't be modest. You're really good.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.084
Yes, I know.
I know Félix better than you do.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.130
Not as a director.
Or has he ever directed you?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.884
What is it?
Were you scared you would ruin the short?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.511
Why don't you take your venom
somewhere else?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.097
I didn't say anything bad.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.100
If it bothers you so much,
there must be some truth to it.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.102
Let's make one thing clear.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.230
I was going to be the original lead
in Félix's short.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.274
If you're taking my place now,
it's because--

12:56.568 --> 12:57.777
A matter of time.

12:57.861 --> 13:01.656
You may not be a good actress,
but you're great at making up excuses.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.617
Do you really think you're better than me?

13:06.244 --> 13:07.245
I know I am.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.538
Prove it.

13:10.707 --> 13:14.502
Marco, listen to me.
Please, let me explain. One second.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.587
[sighs]

13:18.256 --> 13:20.925
I never wanted to take your part.
It was Cocó's decision.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.635
Enough.
I don't want to talk about Adam anymore.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.804
-Don't you get it?
-And the band?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.556
They're waiting for us to record a demo.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.141
Marco,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.185
-This is our dream.
-Hey.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.603
Listen. There you two are.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.147
The producer just called me.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.776
He said they got tired of waiting,
and they called another band.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.113
I got tired of waiting too.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.409
What? What? What are you saying?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.495
That Serotonin is over.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.039
I'm leaving the band.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.304
-Should we start?
-No.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.348
First, I want to propose something.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.433
Here comes another great idea
from the director.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.227
Tell us.

14:12.310 --> 14:16.523
I was thinking it might be
more interesting if we made a bet.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.857
If Allegra wins,

14:17.941 --> 14:21.277
you are going to convince your mom
to let her audition.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.697
No. I don't know.
That has nothing to do with it.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.074
What's wrong? Are you afraid you'll lose?

14:27.075 --> 14:28.993
Not at all. And if I win?

14:30.370 --> 14:34.499
I will rewrite the script of my short
to incorporate your ideas.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.584
-Félix.
-All of them?

14:36.668 --> 14:38.795
All of them. I give you my word.

14:39.295 --> 14:43.091
Okay. All right, I agree.
I'm going to change.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.055
How could you bet your future?
You can't let Sofía ruin your short.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.099
And you can't achieve your dream
in the past.

14:51.182 --> 14:54.436
You have to do it in the present.
And for that, you have to beat Sofía.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.022
This is a street dance battle, Félix.
Not a professional audition.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.149
The winner won't be the best.
It'll be who gets the most votes.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.233
I know.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.903
They're going to vote on a story posted
on Sofía's account. I have no chance.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.613
You're risking it all with this.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.450
I'm risking it all for you.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.587
@Julii.ju90
I'm dying to see this

16:02.671 --> 16:04.339
@Abruu.abril
Sofía, I love youuuuuu

16:04.422 --> 16:05.965
@Feli.23_
Greetings from Uruguay!!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.137
-[gasps]
-[crowd] Ooh.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.866
@Fedenahuel.1
Allegra, love you, starting to follow you

16:33.451 --> 16:34.744
@Mili_bsas
She's amazing, she couldn't care less

16:34.828 --> 16:36.579
@Caami_19
They are killing itttt

16:52.178 --> 16:55.432
-[applause]
-[crowd cheers]

16:59.728 --> 17:00.937
[typing on cell phones]

17:01.021 --> 17:02.313
All right guys, what happened?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.399
[typing continues]

17:04.482 --> 17:05.483
Guys.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.237
By Odin's beard, guys. Say something.
What happened?

17:09.821 --> 17:10.864
Odin?

17:10.947 --> 17:14.534
Yes, Odin. Odin… Thor's father.
Don't you know?

17:15.118 --> 17:16.828
-No.
-You're not normal.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.164
Did we win or not?

17:19.247 --> 17:20.248
[beeps]

17:20.832 --> 17:22.375
Yes, we won? We won.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.044
-Congratulations.
-Ah, yes.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.670
I can't believe it.

17:25.754 --> 17:29.049
You were much better than Allegra.
You were perfect.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.510
It looks like your followers don't care
about perfection, eh?

17:32.594 --> 17:34.137
They prefer to have fun.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.638
Let's go, Alan.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.974
Hey. Where are you going?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.934
Do you want us to stay
and celebrate with you two?

17:40.018 --> 17:42.729
No. I want you
to fulfill your part of the bet.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.398
Did you think I was for real?

17:46.274 --> 17:48.068
Are you really such a sore loser?

17:48.902 --> 17:52.614
Stop, Félix. It's not worth arguing
with someone that has no moral code.

17:52.697 --> 17:56.409
No. No, stop. I'm not leaving
until Sofía keeps her word.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.453
Are you that scared of Allegra?

17:58.953 --> 18:02.957
Come on, Félix.
This was just a game. It wasn't for real.

18:03.958 --> 18:04.959
A game.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.586
I know.

18:06.670 --> 18:10.548
And what if we play
that I leave you out of my short?

18:10.632 --> 18:13.635
You're going to leave me out of your short
because of a stupid bet?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.221
Because of a stupid challenge?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.431
I can't direct someone I don't trust.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.558
You can't say that to me
after everything we talked about.

18:20.642 --> 18:24.104
So show me that I can trust you. Simple.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.408
You won.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.035
-I believe in you. Let's see.
-[beeps]

18:42.080 --> 18:44.416
[horns honking]

18:44.499 --> 18:46.292
-I need to talk to you.
-Yes. I know.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.878
I saw the live of the challenge
with Allegra.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.089
I shouldn't have agreed to it.
It was a mistake.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.425
It wasn't a mistake.
Don't play the martyr.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.761
Next time,
make sure it's not being recorded

18:56.845 --> 19:00.223
if you're going to compete against someone
more prepared than you. That's all.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.808
I'm much better than Allegra.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.977
You don't have to make excuses
with me, honey.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.770
Next time will be different.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.231
You plan to challenge Allegra again?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.150
No. I have another idea.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.611
Let Allegra audition tomorrow
at the final audition.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.113
And why would I do that?

19:15.196 --> 19:17.866
So I can destroy her on stage
in front of everyone.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.203
All right.

19:22.287 --> 19:26.166
Sometimes we need a little competition
to bring out the best in us.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.045
Let's go.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.510
[Tomás] Look, Greta.
Opening day is in a few hours.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.304
I understand that you're upset.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.930
You were the cover.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.975
You are the one
that deserved to play the part of Ellie,

19:44.059 --> 19:46.061
but I can't do anything about it.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.439
This is just another one of Cocó's whims.
Understand?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.566
No, it's not that.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.109
On the contrary,

19:53.193 --> 19:56.071
I think the audition was fair
and that the best actress got the part.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.947
I don't understand.
What do you want to talk about?

19:58.031 --> 20:00.283
I wanted to apologize to her.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.911
If we're going to go on tour,
we need to get along.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.081
That is a very mature attitude
on your part. Very good.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.415
Congratulations. That's great.

20:07.499 --> 20:11.544
Yes, but it's a little hard for me
to say it to her in person.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.545
Uh-huh.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.422
I thought
it would be best to send a letter.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.092
-Yes.
-But I don't have her address.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.386
And none of the others do either.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.724
I understand, Greta. I understand.

20:24.808 --> 20:25.892
Let's see. Let's see.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.729
[drawer opens, closes]

20:31.314 --> 20:33.692
Laura. Let's find her.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.785
Her information isn't here.
That's strange.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.622
Maybe the information is
on the parental permission slip?

20:49.332 --> 20:50.333
The permission slip…

20:54.004 --> 20:56.548
From the office to university
and from university to home.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.133
No distractions along the way. All right?

20:58.216 --> 21:00.343
Thank you for giving me so much freedom.

21:00.427 --> 21:04.055
Don't be dramatic, Marco.
I worked and studied at your age too.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.765
You chose to study economics, while I--

21:05.849 --> 21:08.560
You are going to have a great career.
You're about to enter the best university.

21:08.643 --> 21:09.894
Will you let me talk, Dad?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.398
I'm late to a meeting, Marco.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.026
We'll talk tonight.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.112
I can't tonight.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.574
And why not? What do you have to do?
Let's hear it.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.618
Tonight I have to…

21:26.619 --> 21:29.956
What? Spit it out.
I'm late. Marco, come on.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.294
I have to study for an accounting exam.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.923
I'm going to the university library
with some classmates.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.178
Didn't you take accounting recently?

21:44.929 --> 21:46.139
Yes.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.391
But this is another unit.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.936
Good. I'm glad you all are so advanced.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.855
All right, I'll see you later.
Go ahead. Bye.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.567
Go on, go on, go on. I'm late, Marco.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.155
Straight home, eh?

22:04.324 --> 22:05.492
No distractions, eh?

22:06.785 --> 22:09.371
I'm a terrible strategist.

22:09.454 --> 22:13.124
If my life were a movie, I think it
would be in the catastrophe genre.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.585
Can you stop feeling sorry for yourself?

22:15.669 --> 22:17.671
It's over. You tried,
and I really appreciate it,

22:17.754 --> 22:19.881
but it was obvious
that it wasn't going to work.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.174
Why do you say that?

22:22.759 --> 22:24.469
It's going to sound ridiculous,

22:24.552 --> 22:27.514
but I can't stop thinking
that my life in '94 is much better.

22:27.597 --> 22:28.598
No.

22:29.766 --> 22:30.767
What's wrong with you?

22:31.893 --> 22:32.894
Why are you so mad?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.730
I told you not to risk your short.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.315
You're incredible, you know that?

22:38.274 --> 22:39.275
I don't understand.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.444
What don't you understand?
What don't you understand?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.655
This has nothing to do
with the short, Allegra.

22:43.738 --> 22:46.908
This has to do with us.
With you, and with me.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.536
You know what?

22:49.619 --> 22:52.789
It terrifies me to think that you could
travel to the past and not come back.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.582
-That's what's wrong.
-That's not going to happen.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.460
How do you know?
And what if what Greta said is true?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.462
What if you end up trapped in the fire?

22:59.546 --> 23:01.214
What if we never see each other again?
Then what?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.465
Everything is going to be okay.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.718
-You have to trust the bracelet.
-Well, I can't.

23:04.801 --> 23:05.802
I can't.

23:06.511 --> 23:09.931
I-- I was thinking and…

23:11.391 --> 23:14.602
The thing is that… I love you.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.314
What?

23:19.149 --> 23:22.110
That's it. I love you.
I love you. I love--

23:22.193 --> 23:24.904
I love how obsessive you are
about organization.

23:24.988 --> 23:29.868
I love when you go on and on about
your dreams and you don't let me talk.

23:30.577 --> 23:36.041
I love that you are the last person
I want to talk to before I go to sleep.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.501
I love this,

23:38.585 --> 23:42.172
the wrinkle on your forehead
when you look at me like I'm crazy.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.382
What?

23:44.466 --> 23:45.925
It's from a movie. It doesn't matter.

23:46.009 --> 23:49.179
It doesn't matter
because I'm not Billy Crystal,

23:49.262 --> 23:51.765
you're not Meg Ryan,
this is not a movie and--

23:54.476 --> 23:56.478
Fiction never becomes reality.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.816
But I can't get around it.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.362
I love you. I love you, Allegra.
I love you.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.863
What are you doing dressed like that?

24:50.156 --> 24:53.702
No, the thing is
I got called for a casting

24:53.785 --> 24:57.622
for an insurance company and…

25:00.375 --> 25:01.376
No.

25:03.211 --> 25:06.673
I can't. I can't keep lying,
especially not to you.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.136
What are you talking about?

25:12.345 --> 25:14.597
I work part-time
at my dad's finance agency.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.474
And I should be taking
the admission course

25:16.558 --> 25:19.102
for the Department of Economics,
but I quit on the first day.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.647
Because I hate economics.
I hate university. I hate these suits.

25:22.731 --> 25:25.191
-Marco. Marco.
-And my dad thinks I'm still going.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.111
Why don't you tell him the truth?

25:29.487 --> 25:30.488
I'm scared.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.535
I've never gotten up
the courage to face him.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.247
He doesn't even know
I'm a part of Eleven O'Clock.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.045
I'm sorry for lying to you.

25:45.879 --> 25:48.840
I'm not the free and independent guy
you think I am.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.802
Well, that's good. You were so perfect
I was starting to get bored.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.641
My mom doesn't really support me
with the Eleven O'Clock thing, either.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.394
She doesn't even know I'm in the company.

26:02.354 --> 26:05.732
And every time I try to talk to her
about it, she won't even listen to me.

26:06.858 --> 26:09.527
How are you supposed to talk to someone
who refuses to listen?

26:11.404 --> 26:12.739
Talk louder?

26:14.324 --> 26:16.159
If you have to yell, yell.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.121
Your dad has to understand you.

26:21.456 --> 26:24.417
And if he doesn't, it's his loss.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.461
It's your life.

27:13.508 --> 27:16.928
[cell phone vibrates, beeps]

27:19.431 --> 27:21.099
-Dante!
-<i>How are you? Is everything okay?</i>

27:21.182 --> 27:22.726
Yes. Thank you. Thank you for calling.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.810
<i>Of course.</i>

27:26.813 --> 27:28.898
And? Did you finish your song?

27:30.984 --> 27:35.363
Voilà, which in French means
that this is the final version of my song.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.657
All that in just one word.

27:37.741 --> 27:40.160
The thing is the French are
a little more concise.

27:40.243 --> 27:41.244
Of course.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.413
I left the band.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.707
And this is a new start
for me as a musician.

27:46.374 --> 27:47.959
And that's all thanks to you.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.838
What's wrong? Was it something I said?

27:53.757 --> 27:56.760
No. I'm just a little nervous
for opening day.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.224
Let's go. I want to show you my song.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.727
-Of course.
-No. This way is faster. Come on.

28:08.730 --> 28:09.731
Open it.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.276
My secret.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.948
CONTROL ROOM

28:20.825 --> 28:22.410
These are all the messages from people

28:22.494 --> 28:24.496
that called to congratulate you
and wish you luck.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.580
[Cocó] Okay.

28:25.663 --> 28:28.124
Mrs. Sharp, let me know when you're ready.
I'm here to dress you.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.709
[Cocó] Give me 15 minutes.

28:29.793 --> 28:31.419
Okay, look up, ma'am.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.171
-For what?
-To put on your blush.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.422
Give it to me. I'll do it.

28:34.506 --> 28:37.467
-Okay. Are you going to want lip liner?
-[cell phone rings]

28:37.550 --> 28:39.094
No, I'm going to brush my eyebrows.

28:39.803 --> 28:40.804
All right.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.516
Leave me, please.
I need to be alone for this conversation.

28:44.599 --> 28:45.600
Okay.

28:51.648 --> 28:54.776
-Hello.
-Cocó dear, how are you?

28:54.859 --> 28:55.902
<i>Quite busy.</i>

28:55.985 --> 28:59.114
Well, I imagine.
I just wanted to wish you a lot of <i>merde</i>.

28:59.197 --> 29:02.826
And just know that this is going
to be an unprecedented success.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.411
I can feel it.

29:04.494 --> 29:09.499
And… if you change your mind, let me know.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.878
I don't feel right betraying Tomás.

29:15.630 --> 29:18.425
This is not personal.
This is show business.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.926
Tomás will understand perfectly.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.302
I don't think so.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.722
<i>Let's see. Eleven O'Clock is your company.</i>

29:24.848 --> 29:26.016
<i>You founded it.</i>

29:26.099 --> 29:28.643
Yes, but Tomás funded the play.

29:30.687 --> 29:35.525
Cocó, Tomás is going to get everything
we collect in the first shows we do here.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.820
<i>Anyway, you two didn't sign</i>
<i>a tour contract, did you?</i>

29:38.903 --> 29:41.031
Let me think about it a little more.

29:41.114 --> 29:44.451
<i>Okay, no problem, but don't take too long</i>
<i>because the clock is ticking.</i>

29:45.243 --> 29:47.120
Okay. Talk to you later.

29:49.247 --> 29:50.248
[cell phone closes]

29:54.669 --> 29:56.671
Tomás. Excuse me, were you looking for me?

29:56.755 --> 29:58.173
Yes, Laura. Come in, please.

29:59.549 --> 30:02.385
Let's see. I need your parents
to sign the permission slip.

30:02.469 --> 30:05.764
Yes. Yes. I forgot. I'll bring it later.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.766
No, no, no. It can't be later.
It has to be now.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.352
Without this permission slip,
I can't let you go on stage.

30:10.435 --> 30:13.104
What's more,
I don't understand how we didn't check

30:13.188 --> 30:14.731
that we had all your paperwork.

30:15.357 --> 30:17.859
Don't worry. Your parents can come
to the office before opening day.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.361
The important thing is that they sign it.

30:19.444 --> 30:21.071
-Please, I'm begging you, eh?
-Yes, my parents…

30:21.154 --> 30:24.115
Laura, what are you doing here?
You should be getting ready.

30:24.199 --> 30:26.701
Let's see, Cocó. We have a small problem.

30:26.785 --> 30:29.204
Laura didn't bring the permission slip
signed by her parents.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.541
We don't need it.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.419
No, no. It's the same situation as Marco.

30:36.503 --> 30:40.090
They're both emancipated.
Don't worry. I have all the documentation.

30:40.173 --> 30:44.969
Either way, I would like, or rather,
I would need a copy of those documents.

30:45.053 --> 30:46.054
Is that possible?

30:46.137 --> 30:48.515
For what, Tomás? Don't you trust me?

30:49.474 --> 30:52.018
You know very well
that I don't like loose ends.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.812
Haven't we talked about this?

30:53.895 --> 30:55.647
Everything is under control.

30:55.730 --> 31:00.527
Come on, Tomás. Relax. Don't worry.
Go and enjoy the show.

31:00.610 --> 31:02.070
It's impossible to relax and enjoy

31:02.153 --> 31:04.239
when you change the lead on me
a few days before opening day.

31:04.322 --> 31:06.950
I mean, it seems to me. Or am I wrong?

31:08.118 --> 31:09.703
I'm sorry, but the press is waiting.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.830
-I have to go talk to them.
-Enjoy, Tomás.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.164
<i>Merde.</i>

31:13.998 --> 31:17.085
[Bárbara vocalizing]

31:18.253 --> 31:20.714
[vocalizing continues]

31:20.797 --> 31:23.550
[Cocó] Everyone ready?
Ten minutes to curtain.

31:25.677 --> 31:27.929
I have a good feeling.

31:28.805 --> 31:31.474
This is going to be
a once-in-a-lifetime night.

31:31.558 --> 31:34.728
My dear daughter. Let's do it, eh?
You're going to be great.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.312
Were you able to talk to Laura?

31:36.396 --> 31:39.566
Don't worry. It's all resolved.
Cocó cleared everything up.

31:39.649 --> 31:41.568
What-- What did she clear up?

31:41.651 --> 31:44.738
That Laura is emancipated and that
she has all the necessary documentation.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.948
So, crisis averted.

31:48.158 --> 31:49.159
[chattering continues]

31:49.242 --> 31:50.702
Bad luck, sweetie.

31:51.453 --> 31:53.204
But look on the bright side.

31:53.997 --> 31:56.416
You get to play the villain.

31:56.499 --> 32:01.671
That means that now you can be Laura's
enemy in the play and in real life.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.048
Isn't that funny?

32:04.507 --> 32:05.717
No, it's not funny.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.636
I'm not going to allow
some ridiculous rules

32:08.720 --> 32:11.765
to stop me from having someone
as talented as you in my company

32:11.848 --> 32:13.391
and in my play.

32:16.561 --> 32:18.772
We haven't known each other long, Laura.

32:19.564 --> 32:24.652
But I feel like there is
a strong connection between us.

32:25.528 --> 32:27.238
I don't know how to explain it.

32:28.782 --> 32:31.201
I would have liked to have had
a daughter like you.

32:31.284 --> 32:33.411
I think you're being a little unfair
to Caterina.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.704
After what she did to me.

32:35.372 --> 32:39.125
I'm sure that if you talk to her,
you two can resolve your problems.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.134
We're all scared before an opening show.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.387
Or are you going to tell me
you're not scared?

32:51.096 --> 32:52.681
But we get over it.

32:52.764 --> 32:55.725
We don't hide behind our excuses
like Caterina did.

32:56.851 --> 33:00.939
I can forgive anything, but not cowardice.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.691
That's not how I raised her.

33:03.441 --> 33:04.901
You're angry now,

33:04.984 --> 33:08.405
but you'll change your mind in the future,
and it might be too late.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.244
This is between me and my daughter.

33:14.327 --> 33:17.747
Right now,
we have to focus on the opening show.

33:19.749 --> 33:25.130
After tonight,
your life is going to change forever.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.551
Today is the grand opening
of <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

33:34.097 --> 33:36.057
Kids, kids.
What are your hopes for tonight?

33:36.141 --> 33:39.769
Honestly very excited, with high hopes
as the show is about to start.

33:39.853 --> 33:41.604
And after the show, Cocó Sharp.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.858

33:44.941 --> 33:47.277

All together, smile, please.

-Have fun.

-Go out there and shine. Let's go.

33:56.536 --> 33:57.537
Marco.

33:58.204 --> 34:02.500
Promise me that whatever happens,
you'll go home as soon as the show ends.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.419
But I thought we were going
to hang out afterwards.

34:04.502 --> 34:05.545
You have to trust me.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.797
Go home and we'll meet up there later.
Okay?

34:07.881 --> 34:10.091
Okay. I promise.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.307
Hey.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.852
Hey, I'm so glad you came.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.520
No way was I going to miss your debut.

34:24.647 --> 34:29.319
What's wrong? You're the lead.
I thought you would be ecstatic.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.738
I'm sad that
you're fighting with your mom.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.449
It's good to be good, but not that good.

34:35.784 --> 34:37.410
My mom is a horrible person.

34:38.036 --> 34:39.746
And she still thinks I'm a coward.

34:40.497 --> 34:43.625
The truth is she never tried
to understand me.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.585
Talk to her about it. Explain it to her.

34:45.669 --> 34:47.837
I tried, but she didn't want to listen.

34:47.921 --> 34:50.590
And if she doesn't want to understand,
then great.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.676
We'll just be mad at each other forever.

34:56.179 --> 34:59.724
Sometimes the body says
what words can't express.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.851
