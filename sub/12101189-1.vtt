00:21.480 --> 00:23.382
Jo!

00:25.918 --> 00:28.186
Jo.

00:33.291 --> 00:35.662
Josephine, come here!

02:16.361 --> 02:20.565
Open your bibles
now to psalm 42.

02:24.536 --> 02:27.907
So I thirst for Him, oh God.

02:27.940 --> 02:32.477
My soul thirsts for God,
for the living God.

02:32.511 --> 02:36.581
When shall I see
the face of my Father?

02:36.615 --> 02:39.384
My tears have been
my food day and night.

02:50.562 --> 02:53.065
Have you forgotten me?

02:53.099 --> 02:54.967
We've all been there,
have we not?

02:55.001 --> 02:55.968
Bill, get up.

02:56.002 --> 03:00.305
On the banks of Jordan,
locked out of heaven....

03:27.099 --> 03:32.672
What are you standing there for?

03:32.705 --> 03:37.944
You got me up too late
to give you a ride.

03:37.977 --> 03:41.047
Go on, get out of here.

04:23.789 --> 04:27.159
So um, you wanna talk about...

04:37.236 --> 04:40.006
Then my dad, my real dad,
not my foster dad,

04:40.039 --> 04:42.607
- he shows up.
- How do you tell it's him?

04:42.642 --> 04:45.477
You know how sometimes
you just know, you know.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.847
No.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.715
But that's not the point.

04:49.749 --> 04:51.884
Anyway, my dad comes home

04:51.918 --> 04:58.658
and we go to the dance and
I can dance, I don't waddle.

05:00.059 --> 05:01.459
And Robert E. Lee says,

05:01.493 --> 05:04.630
"Selma, you're the prettiest,
best dancer.

05:04.664 --> 05:08.935
Would you marry one of my sons?"

05:08.968 --> 05:13.571
I say, "No.

05:13.605 --> 05:17.410
I have to dance with my dad."

05:20.146 --> 05:21.781
Do you think presidents
have people to tell them

05:21.814 --> 05:24.582
what their dreams mean, like
Joseph in the Old Testament?

05:24.616 --> 05:28.553
No, dreams don't mean things.

05:30.656 --> 05:33.893
Is that your real dad?

05:36.262 --> 05:39.899
You want to talk about it?

05:44.236 --> 05:48.207
Let me see.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.910
You wanna sing our prayers?

05:50.943 --> 05:52.610
Wanna say our prayers,
you gonna say your prayers?

05:52.645 --> 05:53.646
You gonna say your prayers?

05:53.679 --> 05:54.780
You gonna say your prayers?

05:54.814 --> 05:56.949
You gonna say your prayers?

05:56.983 --> 05:58.985
He's gonna smite you.

05:59.018 --> 06:02.254
I'm gonna smite you.

06:05.057 --> 06:06.258
Thank you, thank you so much

06:06.292 --> 06:08.928
for spending
Saint Patty's with us.

06:08.961 --> 06:10.796
Hopefully we'll help you
make it memorable.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.765
I'm Johnny Alverez.

06:12.798 --> 06:14.300
Anybody out there have youngins?

06:15.768 --> 06:17.870
All right, all right.

08:00.372 --> 08:04.910
Grab me those covers.

08:09.381 --> 08:11.684
Grab me those covers.

08:17.189 --> 08:21.060
Give me those covers, dammit!

08:25.898 --> 08:29.768
What are you crippled
or retarded?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.876
Ugh, it's freezing.

08:36.909 --> 08:39.411
I'm freezing.

08:48.754 --> 08:50.656
I know I've been hard on you.

08:58.797 --> 09:01.167
Times...

09:01.200 --> 09:05.404
times have been tough
without your mom.

09:15.181 --> 09:17.049
Don't leave me.

09:17.082 --> 09:19.151
Don't you leave me.

09:19.185 --> 09:22.388
Don't you walk away.

09:22.421 --> 09:24.290
Please.

09:24.323 --> 09:27.993
Come back.

09:28.027 --> 09:29.161
Jo.

09:31.797 --> 09:34.133
Jo.

09:45.044 --> 09:48.280
Please.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.385
Josephine, come here.

10:59.418 --> 11:03.822
No, my name is Jo!

11:03.856 --> 11:06.525
Jo, come on, come here,

11:06.558 --> 11:08.193
I want to show you something.

11:08.227 --> 11:11.897
Tah-dah!

11:11.930 --> 11:14.900
- Those flowers are so pretty.
- Yeah.

11:14.933 --> 11:17.069
What color are those flowers?

11:17.102 --> 11:18.537
Purple and pink.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.539
Ah, do you love them,
they're beautiful.

11:20.572 --> 11:22.374
Is there a spider in there?

11:22.408 --> 11:27.179
Yeah, there's a spider in there.

11:27.212 --> 11:30.015
- Oh my gosh.
- A ton of spiders.

11:30.049 --> 11:31.984
A ton of spiders?

11:32.017 --> 11:34.320
Can you get my sweater?

11:36.522 --> 11:38.390
Thank you!

11:38.424 --> 11:40.292
- We don't want to forget it.
- Nope.

11:40.326 --> 11:42.561
- Nope, I'll carry it.
- You'll carry it.

11:42.594 --> 11:44.863
Okay, where are you
going to carry it?

11:44.897 --> 11:46.465
You want to wear it?

11:46.498 --> 11:51.203
- Yeah, 'cause I'm cold.
- 'Cause you're cold?

11:54.973 --> 11:59.211
You're beautiful!

11:59.244 --> 12:00.479
Ugh, wow.

12:03.916 --> 12:06.185
Give me kisses.

12:06.218 --> 12:08.220
No, no kisses?

12:08.253 --> 12:12.057
Ugh, fine.

12:12.091 --> 12:13.525
The huggy monkey!

12:13.559 --> 12:14.993
The huggy monkey!

12:15.027 --> 12:19.231
Okay,
I love being a huggy monkey!

12:38.283 --> 12:41.253
Good morning,
today is Tuesday, June 24th

12:41.286 --> 12:42.955
and the last day of school.

12:46.693 --> 12:51.130
Do not fill permanent homes
but mobile tents.

12:51.163 --> 12:53.700
Lonnie come on.

12:53.733 --> 12:56.468
- Lonnie's....
- The further they go,

12:56.502 --> 12:58.370
the more the road
that lies ahead

12:58.404 --> 13:02.307
opens up,
presenting a dark horizon.

13:02.341 --> 13:06.646
Lost in immensity.

13:06.679 --> 13:08.547
Now can God remain silent

13:08.580 --> 13:14.052
in the face of these parched
lips that cry out?

13:14.086 --> 13:17.690
I know I've asked
myself that question.

13:17.724 --> 13:19.425
Let us turn to the...

14:03.302 --> 14:06.238
Whatcha gonna do?

14:06.271 --> 14:08.340
Should cover him first.

14:08.373 --> 14:09.709
I ain't touching him.

14:09.742 --> 14:11.744
Such a girl.

14:11.778 --> 14:15.080
What's wrong with that?

14:17.316 --> 14:20.118
Do boys turn into baby worms?

14:20.152 --> 14:24.757
Nah, not if I cover him.

14:27.059 --> 14:31.631
Whatcha gonna do without a dad?

14:31.664 --> 14:35.033
Don't need a dad.

15:33.258 --> 15:35.728
Aw shit.

17:03.248 --> 17:06.618
Plah!

17:12.892 --> 17:15.394
- It declined, buddy.
- Try again.

17:15.427 --> 17:19.666
Once declined
it will decline again.

17:19.699 --> 17:22.401
- It's declined.
- Try again.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.937
It's not magic check
your eight ball.

17:24.971 --> 17:29.274
Thank you.

17:31.678 --> 17:33.278
- How you doing?
- Fine, how are you doing?

17:33.311 --> 17:35.280
I'm good, good, good.

17:35.313 --> 17:38.951
Have to let go.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.571
Ugh.

17:59.604 --> 18:01.808
Ugh.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.489
Mommy!

19:24.523 --> 19:27.392
Mommy!

19:34.934 --> 19:40.673
- No, no, no, no.
- Mom!

19:54.887 --> 19:58.124
Bill smells like the turkey
plant on process day.

20:18.678 --> 20:22.648
- Hello?
- Todd says you're fired.

20:22.682 --> 20:26.786
So there's that
and then on an unrelated note,

20:26.819 --> 20:28.520
can I borrow your car...

22:07.552 --> 22:09.188
Do you wanna watch TNT tonight?

22:09.221 --> 22:11.623
No.

22:11.657 --> 22:14.093
- (indistinct)?
- No.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.527
I can go for
some waffles right now.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.163
No.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.270
What are we gonna do
for the rest of the summer?

22:42.188 --> 22:46.058
I love Los Angeles,
I love living here.

22:46.092 --> 22:50.730
But it is a big city,
it gets lonely fast.

22:50.763 --> 22:52.564
I remember I just moved
from Saint Louis

22:52.597 --> 22:53.899
maybe six months before

22:53.933 --> 22:55.901
and some friends
took me up to this hill

22:55.935 --> 22:58.137
over Lincoln Heights
for The Fourth

22:58.170 --> 22:59.972
and fireworks
were going off all over

23:00.006 --> 23:03.175
like we'd just won a war
or something.

23:03.209 --> 23:04.777
It's one of those moments
that makes you wish

23:04.810 --> 23:09.248
you had somebody.

23:09.281 --> 23:12.985
Some family.

23:13.019 --> 23:16.956
I must've kissed
the first girl I saw.

23:16.989 --> 23:19.658
Well, that's LA, man.

23:19.692 --> 23:21.961
That's LA.

23:32.304 --> 23:34.774
Mobile, WTOP-FM Washington.

23:34.807 --> 23:36.876
WTOP-FM Braddock Heights,

23:36.909 --> 23:39.645
WWWTFM Onassis Fredericksburg.

23:39.678 --> 23:42.248
Worldwide at WPOT.com.

23:42.281 --> 23:43.349
Good afternoon,
I'm Hillary Howard.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.117
I'm Sean Anderson coming up...

23:45.151 --> 23:47.953
Talks of a cleaner bay and
mixed predictions of dead zones.

23:47.987 --> 23:49.789
- This is Hank Sullivan...
- A little girl's birthday

23:49.822 --> 23:51.290
in the Shenandoah Valley
was interrupted

23:51.323 --> 23:53.359
by an uninvited guest.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.894
A floating corpse.

23:54.927 --> 23:56.762
I'm Todd Diglsby.

23:56.796 --> 23:59.098
That familiar flash
in your rearview mirror

23:59.131 --> 24:01.901
now at these intersections,
I'm Adam Scott...

24:01.934 --> 24:05.171
Probably too swollen fat
with water to recognize.

24:05.204 --> 24:08.107
Like when your fingers
get all rainy in the bathtub.

24:08.140 --> 24:13.245
Except with his face.

24:13.279 --> 24:17.783
Hey, did you order pizza?

24:17.817 --> 24:22.288
It's the fuzz, you idiot!

24:38.804 --> 24:40.172
It's John Rambo to you, bud.

24:40.206 --> 24:41.440
You're like a kid
with his lights, I swear.

24:41.474 --> 24:43.275
- Nobody's here anyways, dude.
- Well, they're definitely

24:43.309 --> 24:46.145
- not going to be now.
- Shut up.

24:46.178 --> 24:50.349
Hey, look County,
we got an open door.

24:50.382 --> 24:53.185
507 County hold 800, we have
an open door of the residence.

24:53.219 --> 24:54.820
- We'll be securing.
- Sheriff's office,

24:54.854 --> 24:57.823
anybody in here,
make yourself known.

25:01.794 --> 25:03.729
It's clear in here.

25:03.762 --> 25:05.231
We got an open door here
to the left.

25:05.264 --> 25:06.932
What's that smell?

25:06.966 --> 25:11.036
Sheriff's office, anybody
in here make yourself known.

25:13.405 --> 25:15.307
Oh my gosh, what is that?

25:15.341 --> 25:17.276
Bill, are you home?

25:17.309 --> 25:20.813
Oh wow,
if he is he's not happy.

25:26.418 --> 25:27.920
I don't want to be
doing paperwork

25:27.953 --> 25:29.788
and I don't want to
find out what the source

25:29.822 --> 25:31.290
of that smell is,
so let's get out of here

25:31.323 --> 25:33.325
and do not look in
that wood stove.

25:33.359 --> 25:36.829
Leave it for investigators,
let's go.

25:36.862 --> 25:38.898
What are you doing this weekend?

25:38.931 --> 25:42.101
Not coming anywhere near
the river, how about you?

25:50.776 --> 25:53.412
That's it, I'm going.

25:53.445 --> 25:55.915
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

25:55.948 --> 26:00.019
I'm gonna find my real dad.

26:00.052 --> 26:01.320
I thought you didn't need a dad.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.222
I don't.

26:03.255 --> 26:07.293
I'm just gonna haul up with him
until I figure things out.

26:07.326 --> 26:09.061
Can I come?

26:09.094 --> 26:10.996
I've always wanted
to see the ocean.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.299
And I've always wanted
to have a real dad.

26:13.332 --> 26:17.803
And LA has both.

26:17.836 --> 26:18.971
If you don't slow me.

26:19.004 --> 26:20.506
No, no, no, I won't slow you.

26:20.539 --> 26:22.007
I promise.

26:22.041 --> 26:24.810
Cross my heart.

26:24.843 --> 26:26.378
Don't you want that?

26:26.412 --> 26:30.349
Only packing these things.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.785
There's more kinds of things
useful here.

26:32.818 --> 26:35.154
You're brining a CD?

26:35.187 --> 26:38.958
It has the address in it.

28:20.559 --> 28:23.095
And even should she forget,

28:23.128 --> 28:28.167
I will not forget.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.636
Now isn't that a nice...

29:46.011 --> 29:47.579
I need $450.

29:47.613 --> 29:50.983
More like 200 bucks.

29:53.619 --> 29:57.690
These snap-ons
are worth 500 alone.

29:57.724 --> 29:59.491
Well, really,
you're not old enough to pawn

29:59.525 --> 30:01.527
or sell anything,
so you get 50 bucks.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.430
Take it or leave it.

30:08.668 --> 30:10.969
Fine.

30:11.003 --> 30:14.039
You got ripped off.

30:14.072 --> 30:15.607
Those snap-ons were $500 alone.

30:15.642 --> 30:20.179
Shut up and look out the window!

30:25.652 --> 30:28.320
I kind of get it
but I kind of don't.

30:28.353 --> 30:31.023
Why don't you want a dad?

30:31.056 --> 30:32.759
Did you meet Bill?

30:32.792 --> 30:34.727
There's more kinds of dads
then just Bills.

30:34.761 --> 30:36.161
Dads are boys.

30:36.195 --> 30:37.730
And there are two kinds of boys.

30:37.764 --> 30:40.299
Stupid boys and pigs.

30:40.332 --> 30:42.568
There's more than
just boys and pigs.

30:42.601 --> 30:45.404
Things that grow are supposed
to grow into something.

30:45.437 --> 30:47.707
So if a pig is supposed
to grow into bacon,

30:47.740 --> 30:49.374
boys supposed to grow into men.

30:49.408 --> 30:50.710
Like Bruce Springsteen.

30:50.743 --> 30:52.411
Pigs don't grow into bacon.

30:52.444 --> 30:53.646
They get cut into bacon.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.314
They grow themselves.

30:55.347 --> 30:57.784
They're for bacon.

30:57.817 --> 30:59.384
Hitler grew into a man.

30:59.418 --> 31:01.688
Just growing
doesn't make you good.

31:01.721 --> 31:03.790
Well...

31:03.823 --> 31:06.525
you've gotta grow right
like apples.

31:06.558 --> 31:09.729
Good apples are red
and shiny and crunchy.

31:09.762 --> 31:12.231
Bad apples are mushy and brown.

31:12.264 --> 31:14.466
Old as apples.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.437
What makes a man crunchy?

31:23.442 --> 31:27.112
Well, it's how he does.

31:27.145 --> 31:30.382
Always picks you up
when you fall

31:30.415 --> 31:31.818
and he lets you
walk way in front

31:31.851 --> 31:34.586
but he's never far behind.

31:34.620 --> 31:36.756
And when somebody
makes fun of your legs

31:36.789 --> 31:41.393
he'll whisper in your ear
that you're pretty.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.765
And he always makes
his words come true

31:45.798 --> 31:50.269
and doesn't say them
if he can't.

33:07.814 --> 33:08.881
Come on!

33:08.915 --> 33:10.883
Selma.

33:10.917 --> 33:14.821
Shut up.

33:21.694 --> 33:24.596
We're out of gas
and food and money.

33:24.631 --> 33:25.665
Why don't we just
turn ourselves in?

33:25.698 --> 33:33.605
Shut up or I'll rip your
stupid runny mouth off.

33:33.640 --> 33:38.176
Go, go, go.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.345
- You're just gonna leave...
- Come on, go, go, go.

33:40.379 --> 33:44.349
Okay, I'm going.

33:52.557 --> 33:55.695
So I guess we're walking.

33:57.529 --> 34:00.365
Stop!

34:00.399 --> 34:03.602
Nothing bad could possibly
happen out here.

34:03.636 --> 34:08.206
Selma.

34:10.910 --> 34:13.278
We'll hop a train
in the morning.

34:19.952 --> 34:21.520
We gotta go back.

34:21.553 --> 34:23.588
Turn ourselves in

34:23.622 --> 34:25.390
and maybe they'll take us
to the orphanage

34:25.424 --> 34:28.593
and it will be all okay.

34:28.628 --> 34:30.328
- Get some sleep.
- No, no, no.

34:30.362 --> 34:31.698
I'm not sleeping here.

34:31.731 --> 34:33.766
Ow.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.903
Stop.

34:39.772 --> 34:43.408
- At least...
- Shut up, I'm not your daddy.

34:43.442 --> 34:45.610
I'm allowed to be scared.

34:45.645 --> 34:48.881
No you're not.

34:48.915 --> 34:52.819
The minute they find out
that you're scared

34:52.852 --> 34:58.223
they're gonna rip your stupid
little face off.

35:12.071 --> 35:15.273
You're gonna tell me so much
about mommies and daddies

35:15.307 --> 35:17.643
and how good they are.

35:17.677 --> 35:19.578
Remind me to tell you something

35:19.611 --> 35:23.548
about mommies and daddies.

35:30.757 --> 35:34.727
They don't want us.

35:53.079 --> 35:57.549
Ain't no one ever stick
their necks out for me.

36:30.783 --> 36:32.051
Get up, get up,
get up, come on.

36:32.084 --> 36:34.954
Get up.

36:34.987 --> 36:38.423
Jo.

36:38.456 --> 36:39.992
Please.

36:40.026 --> 36:43.062
Get up, get up.

36:43.095 --> 36:46.398
Wait no, no.

36:46.431 --> 36:52.071
No, don't leave me, please.

36:52.104 --> 36:55.507
No!

37:17.663 --> 37:20.398
I'm sorry.

37:20.432 --> 37:23.970
I'm sorry.

37:24.003 --> 37:26.438
Jo, I'm sorry.

37:26.471 --> 37:31.576
Next time you slow me
I won't come back for you.

37:41.654 --> 37:45.091
What now?

38:16.188 --> 38:20.192
What's so bad about foster care?

38:20.226 --> 38:25.463
I'm done being a...

39:16.248 --> 39:17.683
The license plate
says Colorado,

39:17.717 --> 39:20.119
doesn't mean
he's going to Colorado.

39:36.568 --> 39:39.038
Did you try the door maybe?

39:39.071 --> 39:42.908
Nobody's gonna leave
their doors unlocked.

41:18.304 --> 41:24.310
I used to be afraid
of heaven when I was younger.

41:24.343 --> 41:29.215
Something that never stops.

41:29.248 --> 41:34.253
Wouldn't it get boring?

41:34.286 --> 41:41.260
I don't know,
I guess I was just scared.

41:41.293 --> 41:47.133
But one day, I waited
till the sun started setting

41:47.166 --> 41:51.904
and I looked straight at him
and he looked straight at me.

41:51.937 --> 41:54.373
And I knew...

41:54.406 --> 41:57.776
I could stay here forever

41:57.810 --> 42:01.280
if my real dad was there.

42:07.820 --> 42:11.757
You done?

42:16.462 --> 42:20.132
Heaven ain't real.

42:40.319 --> 42:44.056
Wake up.

43:47.386 --> 43:50.022
I hope you're happy.

43:50.055 --> 43:53.359
Yeah, I'm happy.

44:30.396 --> 44:33.565
It's better.

44:59.591 --> 45:04.363
Preggers.

45:04.396 --> 45:08.400
Where's my gob?

45:08.434 --> 45:11.970
You ate my gob, didn't you?

45:12.004 --> 45:16.408
You only get those gobs
in J-Town.

45:16.442 --> 45:18.877
It's pretty far.

45:21.113 --> 45:22.548
It's my cheat day.

45:22.581 --> 45:23.582
- Ugh!
- Donnie, what the hell

45:23.615 --> 45:26.985
- are you doing?
- Ah!

45:27.019 --> 45:28.420
Donnie,
what the hell are you doing?

45:28.454 --> 45:29.955
Stop it.

45:38.931 --> 45:43.135
Donnie, I think you gotta
lay off the pre-workout.

45:52.444 --> 45:55.581
Hi.

45:55.614 --> 45:57.516
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

45:57.549 --> 46:00.619
I'm sure they were not
good to you.

46:00.653 --> 46:05.624
I'm Pete and now I have no idea
what's going on right now.

46:05.658 --> 46:07.694
This punk jumped me.

46:07.727 --> 46:12.131
He's beating up preggers
over a stupid pastry.

46:12.164 --> 46:13.265
Donnie!

46:13.298 --> 46:18.671
Don't say words.

46:19.972 --> 46:22.007
You running?

46:22.040 --> 46:23.509
I don't mean anything by it.

46:23.542 --> 46:27.246
I get it is all.

46:27.279 --> 46:28.681
Different week, different house.

46:28.715 --> 46:32.351
Different mommy,
different daddy.

46:32.384 --> 46:35.020
Same bruises.

46:35.053 --> 46:40.092
You heading west?

46:40.125 --> 46:44.029
Mhm, no, no, no.

46:44.062 --> 46:48.333
There's a big difference
between a runner and a killer.

46:48.367 --> 46:54.072
You don't want to
cross that line.

46:54.106 --> 46:56.442
Look, I can take you as far as
Delta County, Colorado.

46:56.475 --> 46:58.110
We've got business there.

46:58.143 --> 47:03.182
Drop you off at Raton,
find you something there.

47:03.215 --> 47:06.518
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

47:06.552 --> 47:09.421
That hurts my feelings.

47:09.455 --> 47:11.691
Strangers?

47:11.724 --> 47:17.229
Honey, we ain't strangers
to calling bruises birthmarks.

47:17.262 --> 47:20.432
Let me show you something.

47:30.442 --> 47:32.211
Go on, take a look.

47:39.151 --> 47:44.791
Let's not worry about...

47:44.824 --> 47:46.558
Ugh!

47:46.592 --> 47:50.429
Ugh.

47:57.269 --> 48:00.339
She a little young, Pete.

48:00.372 --> 48:01.340
Mm.

49:22.855 --> 49:29.762
Jo.

49:29.796 --> 49:31.864
Josephine, come here.

49:45.745 --> 49:49.481
Jo.

49:49.514 --> 49:51.483
Come on.

50:59.719 --> 51:01.921
- Are you okay?
- Sh, stay there.

51:01.954 --> 51:06.458
Just trust me.

52:05.550 --> 52:07.954
Hey, Nicky, keep an eye
on the girl, all right?

53:29.802 --> 53:32.805
Are you my guardian angel?

53:34.106 --> 53:35.908
Yes.

53:45.117 --> 53:48.988
You know,
I dated this girl once,

53:49.021 --> 53:52.091
and... well,
I didn't really date her,

53:52.124 --> 53:53.826
like, we went on a few dates,

53:53.860 --> 53:55.627
and they were nice dates,

53:55.661 --> 53:59.165
and I really thought
we were gonna stick it out,

53:59.198 --> 54:01.801
and then she told me,

54:01.834 --> 54:04.670
"You're too short."

54:04.704 --> 54:07.039
Is there a gun around?

54:07.073 --> 54:08.406
Yeah.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.475
Right in there.

54:11.911 --> 54:14.412
I'm too short?

54:14.446 --> 54:16.682
You're too tall!

54:20.686 --> 54:23.823
Can you see the future?

54:23.856 --> 54:26.792
Do I ever get married?

54:27.960 --> 54:30.897
I hope I marry Margot Robbie.

54:30.930 --> 54:33.065
She'd be my first pick.

54:33.099 --> 54:37.703
But if I could go back,
it'd be Marisa Tomei.

54:37.737 --> 54:40.572
But I really want
to have kids.

54:40.605 --> 54:43.575
Like six or seven kids.

54:43.608 --> 54:45.144
Probably seven kids.

54:45.177 --> 54:50.182
- Like, I date her now...
- Show me the nearest town.

54:50.216 --> 54:53.052
Uh...

54:53.085 --> 54:54.854
Bingo.

54:54.887 --> 54:57.857
And this.

54:57.890 --> 54:59.158
That?

55:01.961 --> 55:04.130
Half a mile

55:04.163 --> 55:06.098
that way.

55:06.132 --> 55:09.068
It would work.

55:09.101 --> 55:11.837
But I really want
to have kids.

55:13.973 --> 55:15.540
Yeah.

55:16.842 --> 55:18.510
Come on.

55:25.785 --> 55:28.486
We can't leave her.

55:28.520 --> 55:32.124
If she didn't want to stay here,
she would've left by now.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.828
I'll leave you too.

55:35.861 --> 55:38.030
You said nobody ever stuck
their neck out for you.

55:38.064 --> 55:40.633
Well, she did,
and if we leave now,

55:40.666 --> 55:42.702
we're no better than them.

57:40.252 --> 57:42.620
Where's my popcorn?

1:02:56.135 --> 1:02:58.604
What will we do if she...

1:05:58.617 --> 1:05:59.819
Jo!

1:06:01.453 --> 1:06:03.522
Jo!

1:06:16.903 --> 1:06:18.705
There's a lot of blood.

1:06:23.876 --> 1:06:27.546
Help! Help!

1:06:27.579 --> 1:06:30.215
Help!

1:06:33.619 --> 1:06:35.822
Anybody, please!

1:06:35.855 --> 1:06:38.290
Our Father,

1:06:38.323 --> 1:06:40.192
who art in heaven,

1:06:40.225 --> 1:06:41.426
hallowed be Thy name...

1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:43.630
- Help!
- Thy kingdom come;

1:06:43.663 --> 1:06:48.367
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:49.869
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1:06:49.902 --> 1:06:51.303
Help...

1:06:51.336 --> 1:06:53.171
...and forgive us
our trespasses.

1:06:54.272 --> 1:06:55.440
Please.

1:06:55.474 --> 1:06:56.943
Help!

1:07:06.753 --> 1:07:08.220
Help!

I ain't never seen Him

1:13:34.807 --> 1:13:36.909
He looks so sad.

1:14:40.139 --> 1:14:42.675
Oh, all right, all right!

1:14:47.713 --> 1:14:49.748
Oh...

1:14:49.782 --> 1:14:52.251
What a strange place this is,
you know?

1:14:55.454 --> 1:14:58.257
Vegas will always be, uh,

1:14:58.290 --> 1:15:02.027
kind of a magic for me.

1:15:02.061 --> 1:15:05.064
My first and only love,

1:15:05.097 --> 1:15:08.000
I think, was conceived here.

1:15:09.401 --> 1:15:11.070
Um...

1:15:11.103 --> 1:15:14.240
This girl in a blue dress
bought me a drink.

1:15:14.273 --> 1:15:16.876
When I asked her why,
she said,

1:15:16.909 --> 1:15:20.246
"A good life is filled
with people you did right by,

1:15:20.279 --> 1:15:23.048
and you need a drink, right?"

1:15:23.082 --> 1:15:25.217
She knew. She always knew.

1:15:27.052 --> 1:15:28.888
Didn't end up
doing right by her,

1:15:28.921 --> 1:15:31.423
but she sure did right by me.

1:16:25.778 --> 1:16:27.746
Is that the Eiffel Tower?

1:16:32.418 --> 1:16:35.120
It's a lot smaller
than I thought.

1:18:41.947 --> 1:18:42.948
Thanks.

1:21:43.095 --> 1:21:44.496
Shoes.

1:21:50.770 --> 1:21:52.371
Do you think he got fat?

1:21:52.404 --> 1:21:54.106
He's not gonna be fat!

1:21:54.139 --> 1:21:55.240
Maybe he went bald.

1:21:55.274 --> 1:21:56.341
He's not!

1:21:56.375 --> 1:21:58.778
He's gonna be the opposite.

1:22:17.797 --> 1:22:20.098
Can I help you?

1:22:22.401 --> 1:22:25.070
Have you seen Johnny Alvarez?

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:30.175
They, uh...

1:22:30.208 --> 1:22:32.578
They broke up a few years back.

1:22:32.611 --> 1:22:34.613
I haven't seen Johnny in...

1:22:36.683 --> 1:22:39.251
- Yeah, I got nothing for you.
- Do you got a number?

1:22:39.284 --> 1:22:41.353
- No.
- An address?

1:22:41.386 --> 1:22:43.522
Look, I got a lot of things
I gotta get done today.

1:22:43.555 --> 1:22:45.223
I don't have time
for a Johnny Alvarez groupie...

1:22:45.257 --> 1:22:47.292
He's my dad.

1:22:49.328 --> 1:22:51.196
Oh, uh...

1:22:55.334 --> 1:22:56.836
Let me check, but...

1:22:56.869 --> 1:23:00.707
Johnny's more of kind of
a stay-at-home, uh...

1:23:00.740 --> 1:23:03.442
He doesn't get out that much.

1:23:26.833 --> 1:23:28.835
Do I look okay?

1:23:28.868 --> 1:23:30.602
You're beautiful.

1:23:30.637 --> 1:23:33.840
Besides, I'll be right here.

1:24:26.693 --> 1:24:28.226
Yeah, I'm comin'.

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:30.328
Yeah.

1:24:30.362 --> 1:24:31.496
What?

1:24:38.971 --> 1:24:41.473
You selling cooking
or something?

1:24:41.506 --> 1:24:43.876
- I just found this...
- I don't want any cookies.

1:24:45.978 --> 1:24:49.214
Oh, I just found this.

1:24:54.386 --> 1:24:55.487
Got a pen?

1:24:57.023 --> 1:24:58.858
No.

1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:02.360
You want an autograph,

1:25:02.394 --> 1:25:06.231
but you don't bring
something to write with.

1:25:10.937 --> 1:25:14.006
I got one inside,
meet me around back.

1:25:45.470 --> 1:25:48.373
What're you doin'
with a backpack that big?

1:25:50.342 --> 1:25:51.978
Big backpack.

1:26:46.531 --> 1:26:50.368
- Name?
- Jo, Jo Frost.

1:26:52.537 --> 1:26:55.775
- Where you from?
- Virginia.

1:26:55.808 --> 1:26:57.977
Long way.

1:27:01.647 --> 1:27:02.882
Where's your mama?

1:27:09.755 --> 1:27:11.691
Ain't got a mama.

1:27:14.626 --> 1:27:16.128
Everybody's got a mama.

1:28:15.821 --> 1:28:18.724
She said your voice was so soft,
it sounded like

1:28:18.758 --> 1:28:21.827
you stole it from an angel
when he was dozin'.

1:28:23.595 --> 1:28:27.733
That sounds like the kind
of sappy crap she'd say.

1:28:43.916 --> 1:28:45.785
Where's your daddy?

1:28:52.692 --> 1:28:55.227
Thought you could tell me that.

1:29:14.246 --> 1:29:17.582
This is the fella
you're lookin' for.

1:29:23.022 --> 1:29:25.992
Those ain't my eyes.

1:29:33.833 --> 1:29:36.002
You got your mama's eyes.

1:29:44.076 --> 1:29:45.644
She said

1:29:45.678 --> 1:29:49.614
she never loved a boy
as much as Johnny Alvarez.

1:29:51.183 --> 1:29:54.720
She wasn't lyin'.

1:29:57.289 --> 1:29:59.591
Your ma had a big heart.

1:30:04.096 --> 1:30:05.264
The biggest.

1:30:08.234 --> 1:30:10.102
But it's too big for just me.

1:30:19.311 --> 1:30:21.080
Did you love her?

1:30:22.248 --> 1:30:25.017
You love every Julia at 18.

1:30:36.796 --> 1:30:38.931
Can I stay with you?

1:33:07.947 --> 1:33:10.749
Always wanted
to see the ocean.

1:34:03.836 --> 1:34:05.204
Ain't you comin'?

1:34:10.609 --> 1:34:13.045
You're 11 years old now.

1:34:13.078 --> 1:34:15.047
It's time.

1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:18.284
I'm only 10 and a half.

1:34:28.994 --> 1:34:32.398
You'll make new friends.

1:34:32.431 --> 1:34:34.466
Have you met me?

1:34:44.576 --> 1:34:47.279
If you go in there
and really be yourself,

1:34:47.313 --> 1:34:50.549
then they'll be racing
to be your best friend.

1:34:53.118 --> 1:34:54.987
No, they won't.

1:34:55.020 --> 1:34:57.156
They ain't nothin' like you.

1:35:01.293 --> 1:35:04.463
There's things I can't give you,
things you need,

1:35:04.496 --> 1:35:07.066
things I want you to have,

1:35:07.099 --> 1:35:09.301
instead of getting in the way.

1:35:15.307 --> 1:35:19.078
You may not have a home,
but you can be a home.

1:35:24.983 --> 1:35:29.388
Besides, I'll be right here!

1:35:50.042 --> 1:35:54.113
Young lady, what are you doing
out here all by yourself?

1:37:27.072 --> 1:37:29.408
I like you.

1:37:29.441 --> 1:37:31.711
What's your name?

1:37:31.744 --> 1:37:33.713
Josephine.

1:37:33.746 --> 1:37:36.683
I'll call you Jo, cool?

1:37:36.716 --> 1:37:40.586
No, call me my name or nothing.

1:37:40.619 --> 1:37:41.721
Cool.

1:37:41.754 --> 1:37:44.022
- Cool.
- Cool.
