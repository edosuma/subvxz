we're just settling in here.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.893

just to listen.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.376
Yeah, he texted
while you were gone.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.030
Said he was stopping by.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.641
- Well, he has
his work face on.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.252
- I'm gonna take
the boys with me.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.906
I don't want them hearing
about some crazy person

12:12.949 --> 12:13.820

12:13.863 --> 12:15.909
- So how was today without me?

12:15.952 --> 12:18.781
- Uh, you know, it was--
it was a lot better, actually.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.304
I think we should have done
this a long time ago.

12:20.348 --> 12:23.394
- Shut up.
- Boys, you're coming with me.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.137

12:31.185 --> 12:32.882

our armored friend here

12:32.926 --> 12:36.494
hit a black market weapons site
last night in Moldova.

- Not sure yet.

Blew out the whole operation
before leaving, though.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.980
What'd he say to you, exactly?

12:44.024 --> 12:46.026
- Just what he knew
about Superman

12:46.069 --> 12:47.810
and that we'd see
each other again.

12:47.854 --> 12:51.248

to make that happen.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.294
This time he came in a ship.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.774
- So he brought more than
just a war suit with him.

12:54.817 --> 12:55.992
- He sure did.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.951
My guys were able to assign

12:57.994 --> 13:00.649

a residence identifier.
