00:00.007 --> 00:02.295
Your transfer to Black Rock
Prison is set for 0600 hours.

00:02.297 --> 00:04.859
You taste different.

00:04.890 --> 00:07.609
- For the greater good.
- How are you holding up?

00:07.625 --> 00:10.102
I feel strong.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.742
- What did you do?
- You play ball, I'll

00:11.745 --> 00:13.973
- help you break the Earp Curse.
- What do we do now?

00:13.975 --> 00:16.125
Find everything from the
Ghost River Triangle and kill it.

00:16.126 --> 00:18.694
- What about Black Badge?
- They should be scared of me.

00:18.715 --> 00:21.620
No matter what they say, I
only really have one job now.

00:33.061 --> 00:34.960
So here we are.

00:34.996 --> 00:37.429
You and me.

00:37.465 --> 00:40.047
All sticky.

00:40.050 --> 00:42.535
We've been stickier.

00:42.571 --> 00:44.437
This water smells like turnips.

00:44.450 --> 00:47.173
In hindsight, maybe
visiting the trailer park

00:47.209 --> 00:50.476
- was not our best idea.
- We combed every scuzzy inch

00:50.512 --> 00:52.444
of Bobo Nation and not one revenant!

00:52.480 --> 00:54.380
Maybe the creature we shot

00:54.416 --> 00:56.248
- ate 'em.
- Like it tried to eat us.

00:56.284 --> 00:59.151
- I can't believe we agreed to do this.
- Agreed?!

00:59.187 --> 01:02.621
We were forced at gunpoint
to sign a blood oath.

01:02.657 --> 01:05.324
We fall in line or
Black Badge makes us bleed.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.526
- This is the worst.
- What?

01:07.562 --> 01:10.663
Perks ain't bad.

01:10.699 --> 01:12.998
- I had to do paperwork.
- And I quote,

01:13.034 --> 01:16.435
"Whatever goo'd us stunk of living anus

01:16.471 --> 01:19.238
and was hairier than a prewaxed Nedley."

01:19.274 --> 01:22.041
- What? That's super accurate.
- One last time,

01:22.077 --> 01:23.542
never touc
