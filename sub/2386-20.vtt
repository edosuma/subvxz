Chester,
you're not even dressed.

00:03.785 --> 00:06.002
- The reservation is in 15 minutes.
- Shh!

00:06.004 --> 00:06.953
He's back.

00:06.955 --> 00:09.422
Every night
at exactly 8:00 p.m.,

00:09.424 --> 00:11.841
the well-dressed
blond man appears.

00:11.843 --> 00:14.677
Chuck and Joanne

00:14.679 --> 00:16.462
are going to be waiting.
You don't understand!

00:16.464 --> 00:18.014
Every night, he does this.

00:18.016 --> 00:20.633
Every single night.

00:20.635 --> 00:22.769
He steps out of this building,

00:22.771 --> 00:25.755
walks exactly seven paces,
stops,

00:25.757 --> 00:28.391
and smiles.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.155
Honey, I am worried about you.

00:42.157 --> 00:43.823
Is he trying to communicate
with someone?

00:43.825 --> 00:45.491
Is he trying
to communicate with me?

00:45.493 --> 00:47.460
Why is he doing this?!

00:47.462 --> 00:48.795
But aside from
not being able

00:48.797 --> 00:51.547
to fart in the apartment,
how's living with Quinn?

00:51.549 --> 00:53.319
Oh, it's great.

Living with Quinn

01:08.466 --> 01:11.901
Great, great,
great... great.

01:11.903 --> 01:12.602
So how bad is it?

01:12.604 --> 01:13.403
Pretty bad.

01:13.405 --> 01:14.237
Last night,

01:14.239 --> 01:15.972
I had just come back

01:15.974 --> 01:17.139
from my 8:00 fart.

01:17.141 --> 01:17.640
Sure.

01:17.642 --> 01:18.574
Go on.

01:18.576 --> 01:20.410
Still no mail.

01:20.412 --> 01:22.495
I think they only deliver it
once a day.

01:22.497 --> 01:23.780
Hey, listen,

01:23.782 --> 01:26.082
when I moved in here,
I sold all my stuff

01:26.084 --> 01:27.867
because I know you like
your place as is,

01:27.869 --> 01:29.419
and I was totally fine
with that.

01:29.421 --> 01:32.205
Just one little thing:
would it be okay

01:32.207 --> 01:34.457
if instead of using
your coffee mugs,

01:34.459 --> 01:35.758
we use mine?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.544
Hmm...

01:38.546 --> 01:40.430
No.

01:40.432 --> 01:43.466
Barney, she got rid
of all of her stuff for you.

01:43.468 --> 01:45.468
Oh, I see what this
is really about.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.837
Yeah, mugs.

01:47.839 --> 01:48.855
Coffee?

01:48.857 --> 01:50.390
Tea?

01:50.392 --> 01:52.558
Eh, religion.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.311
This is about the fact
that you don't think

01:55.313 --> 01:57.513
this relationship
is gonna last.

01:57.515 --> 02:00.033
That's why you don't want
to throw anything out.

02:00.035 --> 02:02.402
Because when
that inevitable breakup comes,

02:02.404 --> 02:04.353
you don't want
to buy new mugs.

02:04.355 --> 02:06.789
That's why I've never
thrown anything out

02:06.791 --> 02:09.157
for any relationship ever.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.861
Isn't that right, honey?

02:11.863 --> 02:13.830
Oh, that's right. I'm alone.

02:13.832 --> 02:15.999
Lily, here's the thing.

02:16.001 --> 02:17.083
It's my apartment,

02:17.085 --> 02:20.586
and I need to assert
my dominance as a man.

02:20.588 --> 02:23.139
Don't ever say that...

02:23.141 --> 02:26.009
to any girl ever.

02:26.011 --> 02:28.094
Too late.

02:28.096 --> 02:29.679
What did you just say to me?

02:29.681 --> 02:31.681
- She gave up her apartment for you!
- You said that to her?!

02:31.683 --> 02:32.932
Okay, you know what?

02:32.934 --> 02:35.818
I don't have to sit here and
take this from you ladies.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.386
I'm going to Ted's.

02:37.388 --> 02:38.888
The man cave,

02:38.890 --> 02:40.556
where guys can be guys.

02:40.558 --> 02:42.575
- Assert your dominance?
- It's like you have no respect for women.

02:42.577 --> 02:44.226
- What is wrong with you?
- You have a mother!

02:44.228 --> 02:45.695
You guys, too?

02:45.697 --> 02:48.197
I'm going to the Y for a shvitz.

02:48.199 --> 02:49.999
No, dude, hold on.

02:50.001 --> 02:51.417
You're not going anywhere.

02:51.419 --> 02:53.336
It's trilogy time.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.440
<i>- Kids, here's the deal</i>-

02:57.442 --> 03:02.178
It all started a long time ago
<i>in a dorm room far, far away.</i>

03:02.180 --> 03:03.463
Dude, if we fail
this econ final,

03:03.465 --> 03:05.414
for the rest of our lives
we're not gonna be able to...

03:05.416 --> 03:07.100
We won't know how to...

03:07.102 --> 03:09.052
Do you even know what econ is?

03:09.054 --> 03:10.686
No idea. We're screwed.

03:10.688 --> 03:14.690
But there's only one thing
left to do at at time like this.

03:14.692 --> 03:16.759
Watch the entire <i>Star Wars</i>
trilogy all the way through

03:16.761 --> 03:18.694
because I haven't done that
in, like, five years.

03:18.696 --> 03:20.063
Dude, you can't let that happen.

03:20.065 --> 03:22.398
If you're not trilling it
at least once every three years,

03:22.400 --> 03:24.100
the Dark Side wins.

03:24.102 --> 03:25.485
Okay, let's make a pact.

03:25.487 --> 03:27.436
No matter what,
every three years,

03:27.438 --> 03:29.622
we sit down
and trill it up big time.

03:29.624 --> 03:30.740
Agreed?

03:30.742 --> 03:33.242
A-Greedo.

03:33.244 --> 03:35.444
Wow.

03:35.446 --> 03:37.497
2003, I mean...

03:37.499 --> 03:39.499
What's that gonna be like?

03:44.287 --> 03:45.888
Hey, Ted.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.173
Sweet hair.

03:47.175 --> 03:49.725
I told you it would
eventually stop growing out

03:49.727 --> 03:51.460
and start growing down.

03:51.462 --> 03:52.845
Anyway, I'm just working

03:52.847 --> 03:55.464
on designing
yet another skyscraper.

03:55.466 --> 03:56.649
And I'm carrying this briefcase

03:56.651 --> 04:00.136
because now
I'm a successful lawyer...

04:00.138 --> 04:01.104
I like that.

04:01.106 --> 04:03.272
Can I make one adjustment?

04:03.274 --> 04:05.908
...with a cool mustache.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.193
Nice.

04:07.195 --> 04:08.528
And who knows, by then,

04:08.530 --> 04:10.163
you and Lily might be engaged.

04:10.165 --> 04:13.499
Engaged? Bro, I'm gonna do
way better than that.

04:13.501 --> 04:18.004
Ah, being pregnant
is so much fun.

04:18.005 --> 04:20.206
I want to do this
four more times.

04:20.208 --> 04:21.491
Oh, baby, how do you feel

04:21.493 --> 04:23.459
after spending all day
working on your art,

04:23.461 --> 04:26.562
since I make enough to
support us both financially?

04:26.564 --> 04:27.630
Horny.

04:27.632 --> 04:29.498
I hope we don't
bother you, Ted,

04:29.500 --> 04:31.634
because even though
we're married and pregnant,

04:31.636 --> 04:33.002
it still makes sense

04:33.004 --> 04:36.422
that we all share
adult-sized bunk beds.

04:37.224 --> 04:40.676
So, <i>Star Wars?</i>

because my boss appreciates that

04:45.567 --> 04:48.618

drinking and...

04:48.620 --> 04:51.187

- Yeah.

06:46.821 --> 06:48.637
By the way, guys, this is Lisa.

06:48.639 --> 06:51.857

Whassaaaa!

06:58.149 --> 06:59.699
Okay,

06:59.701 --> 07:01.701

about how great
our lives were gonna be,

07:22.340 --> 07:24.140
Sure, it's not
the most lucrative field,

but luckily I have
the cash and prizes

07:26.444 --> 07:28.644
from my historic seven-week run

07:28.646 --> 07:31.230
on <i>Wheel of Fortune...</i>

07:31.232 --> 07:33.366
Can I just make
one little adjustment?

07:39.540 --> 07:41.457
Oh, Sir Marshall.

07:41.459 --> 07:43.292
I cannot wait to get a house

07:43.294 --> 07:45.127
down the street
from your parents

07:45.129 --> 07:48.831
so we can be close to your mom,
whom I get along with now.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.166
Good, good.

07:50.168 --> 07:51.584
But here's the best part.

07:51.586 --> 07:53.502
Rhiannon, hurry!

07:53.504 --> 07:55.471
Just because I designed
the opera house

07:55.473 --> 07:58.224
doesn't mean they'll hold
the curtain for us.

07:58.226 --> 07:59.642
Just kidding.

07:59.644 --> 08:00.976
Of course it does.

08:00.978 --> 08:03.095
Take your time, my love.

08:03.097 --> 08:06.215
Hey, guys, it's me again.

08:06.217 --> 08:07.900
I'm pretty much
the same as last time,

08:07.902 --> 08:10.853
only now I'm super-rich
and fancy.

08:13.724 --> 08:17.860
And it still makes sense
that we all live together.

08:19.831 --> 08:21.280
What about you, Barney?

08:21.282 --> 08:23.115
Any predictions for 2006?

08:23.117 --> 08:25.117
Oh, yeah. Picture it.

08:25.119 --> 08:27.403
By the way, guys,
this is Jody.

08:27.405 --> 08:30.289
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Jody.

08:32.008 --> 08:34.243
And they never saw her again.

08:34.245 --> 08:36.962
Whassaaaa!

08:36.964 --> 08:40.349
How is that any different
from your life right now?

08:40.351 --> 08:42.217
It's not. I'm KFC, baby.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.253
You don't mess
with the Colonel's recipe.

08:45.138 --> 08:46.806
I want things to stay
exactly the same,

08:46.808 --> 08:48.424
but with a different hottie.

08:48.426 --> 08:50.810
'Cause Barney don't slurp
no sloppy seconds,

08:50.812 --> 08:53.896
especially his own.

08:53.898 --> 08:55.531
Okay, the bottom line is

08:55.533 --> 08:57.149
things are gonna get better.

08:57.151 --> 08:59.485
Well, all I care about is
getting into law school.

08:59.487 --> 09:00.936
You will.

09:00.938 --> 09:03.689
2006 is gonna be awesome.

09:08.078 --> 09:09.662
And look what happened.

09:09.664 --> 09:11.330
You got into law school,

09:11.332 --> 09:12.965
just like I said you would.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.217
See, things aren't so bad.

09:15.219 --> 09:16.618
Lily left me.

09:17.587 --> 09:21.390
And now I'll never have
a mustache.

09:27.590 --> 09:29.390
Baby, there you are.

09:29.392 --> 09:32.060
I have spent all day thinking
about all the naughty,

09:32.062 --> 09:34.429
naughty things
you and I are gonna do

09:34.431 --> 09:35.463
to cheer up Marshall.

09:35.465 --> 09:37.432
Like what?

09:37.434 --> 09:38.766
Um...

09:38.768 --> 09:41.135
Uh, I'll you guys
hang out, okay?

09:41.137 --> 09:42.737
Um, I'll just be...

09:42.739 --> 09:43.738
waiting in the bedroom.

09:44.824 --> 09:46.357
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean that

09:46.359 --> 09:49.394
to sound like Ted and I are
gonna do a kind of thing.

09:53.315 --> 09:54.482
Okay, okay.

09:54.484 --> 09:55.833
See you.

09:55.835 --> 09:57.085
Marshall, this will pass.

09:57.087 --> 09:58.252
Trust me.

09:58.254 --> 10:00.338
Three years from now...

10:01.823 --> 10:03.658
Briefcase, lawyer,

10:03.660 --> 10:05.009
knighthood, mustache,

10:05.011 --> 10:06.878
all that stuff from before.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.513
Congratulations, bro.

10:08.515 --> 10:10.348
And congratulations
to you too, Ted,

10:10.350 --> 10:12.133
for locking this down.

10:13.302 --> 10:14.552
You know, it's weird,

10:14.554 --> 10:16.187
I never thought I
would get married,

10:16.189 --> 10:17.438
but you talked me into it.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.607
Or rather, banged
me into it.

10:19.609 --> 10:21.392
You're so good in bed, ooh.

10:23.513 --> 10:25.113
How is this helping me?

10:25.115 --> 10:26.280
I'm getting to it.

10:26.282 --> 10:30.368
In three years, not only
will Lily be back, but...

10:30.370 --> 10:34.188
It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

10:34.190 --> 10:37.125
and be carrying his child.

10:37.127 --> 10:39.377
I think you're being
kind of optimistic, Ted.

10:39.379 --> 10:41.963
Can I make
one little adjustment?

10:41.965 --> 10:45.983
It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

10:45.985 --> 10:47.635
and carrying his child,

10:47.637 --> 10:49.754
and here he is now.

10:49.756 --> 10:51.889
Guys, I want you to meet

10:51.891 --> 10:53.841
some douchey guy named Trey.

10:53.843 --> 10:56.094
- 'Sup, bro?
- Mmm.

10:56.096 --> 10:57.878
I don't know
what I love more:

10:57.880 --> 10:59.647
his thick mustache

10:59.649 --> 11:00.732
or his trucker hat.

11:00.734 --> 11:02.767
You know I hate those hats.

11:02.769 --> 11:05.436
Then you're really gonna
hate this sonogram.

11:08.390 --> 11:12.026
Nooo...

11:12.028 --> 11:15.229
ooo...!

11:16.315 --> 11:19.951
A baby in a trucker hat.
That's awesome.

11:19.953 --> 11:21.018
Anyway,
Ted's right.

11:21.020 --> 11:23.504
2009's gonna rule.

11:23.506 --> 11:25.506
By the way, guys,
this is Maya.

11:25.508 --> 11:29.427
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

11:30.597 --> 11:32.430
And they never saw her again.

11:32.432 --> 11:33.914
Whassaaaa!

11:33.916 --> 11:35.082
Okay, seriously,

11:35.084 --> 11:36.350
at least tell me
you're gonna

11:36.352 --> 11:38.085
change the what
will by then be

11:38.087 --> 11:39.420
nine-year-old beer
commercial reference.

11:39.422 --> 11:40.354
I mean,
come on.

11:40.356 --> 11:41.606
There's got to be
at least one way

11:41.608 --> 11:43.191
that you'd like the future
to be different.

11:43.193 --> 11:45.777
I guess there is one thing.

11:45.779 --> 11:47.595
By the way, guys, this is Maya.

11:47.597 --> 11:49.731
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

11:49.733 --> 11:51.866
And not because
of these these.

11:51.868 --> 11:55.019
Because of <i>these.</i>

11:55.788 --> 11:57.989
Back boobs--
the visual stimulation

11:57.991 --> 12:00.074
of missionary meets
the emotional detachment

12:00.076 --> 12:01.409
of doggy-style.

12:01.411 --> 12:02.710
Patent pending.

12:02.712 --> 12:04.078
Whassaaaa!

12:04.080 --> 12:06.113
The point is, Marshall,

12:06.115 --> 12:10.017
this time in three years,
everything is gonna be great.

12:14.306 --> 12:16.307
See? Lily came back.

12:16.309 --> 12:19.427
Of course, Robin and I
didn't end up together.

12:19.429 --> 12:21.512
But I did get engaged.

12:21.514 --> 12:23.314
And left at the altar.

12:23.316 --> 12:25.349
But I did start
my own architectural firm.

12:25.351 --> 12:27.101
And it failed
after a few months.

12:27.103 --> 12:29.103
- Can we put the movie on, please?
- Yeah.

12:29.105 --> 12:29.937
Sure, buddy.

12:29.939 --> 12:31.472
Hey, by the way,
where is Robin?

12:31.474 --> 12:33.324
<i>In the summer of 2009,</i>

12:33.326 --> 12:35.426
<i>Barney and Robin</i>
<i>were secretly dating.</i>

12:35.428 --> 12:37.945
Oh, uh, Barney said she's
taking some extension class

12:37.947 --> 12:39.664
in how to decoupage,
and Barney's taking

12:39.666 --> 12:41.649
a different decoupage class
in the same building.

12:41.651 --> 12:43.918
That's why they shared
that cab that one time.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.255
<i>We were idiots.</i>

12:47.257 --> 12:49.156
Wait a minute.

12:49.158 --> 12:53.744
You're saying that Barney Stinson
is at a decoupage class?

12:54.863 --> 12:56.964
That means we can watch
<i>Star Wars</i> on his giant TV!

12:56.966 --> 12:58.800
Punch it, Chewy!

13:02.971 --> 13:05.223
Oh.

13:05.225 --> 13:06.340
You're back
from decoupage.

13:06.342 --> 13:07.692
What's decoupage?

13:07.694 --> 13:10.394
Oh, uh, yeah, I took that
cab there that one time.

13:10.396 --> 13:11.896
Hold on.

13:13.315 --> 13:16.016
Come on in.

13:17.069 --> 13:19.520
We were hoping we could
watch the trilogy here.

13:19.522 --> 13:22.456
Uh, sure. But, uh...

13:22.458 --> 13:24.692
first go look out
my, uh, bedroom window.

13:24.694 --> 13:26.661
There's a, uh...

13:26.663 --> 13:29.463
naked lady, uh...

13:29.465 --> 13:32.032
jumping up and down
on a mini-trampoline

13:32.034 --> 13:34.752
in the apartment
across the, uh...

13:34.754 --> 13:36.220
street.

13:41.042 --> 13:43.644
Get me out of this thing!

13:43.646 --> 13:44.929
There's no time!

13:44.931 --> 13:47.265
Barney, I am not ready for them
to find out about us.

13:47.267 --> 13:49.383
Then you're gonna have to stay
in there for the entire trilogy.

13:49.385 --> 13:51.652
Don't worry. It's
only 382 minutes.

13:51.654 --> 13:52.987
Nerd!

13:55.908 --> 13:58.109
So, where do you guys think
we'll be in three years?

13:58.111 --> 13:59.894
It'll be 2012.

13:59.896 --> 14:01.779
That's an easy one.

14:01.781 --> 14:03.014
Guys, this is Sophia.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.066
You'll be seeing a lot more of...

14:06.735 --> 14:08.819
Okay, that is so weird.

14:08.821 --> 14:12.139
I was just trying
to use the force.

14:12.141 --> 14:14.592
Do you think instead
of making a beer

14:14.594 --> 14:17.595
fly out of the fridge,
I made that lamp break?

14:17.597 --> 14:19.764
Either that
or the stormtrooper did.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.634
Oh, the stormtrooper
would never do that.

14:23.636 --> 14:27.154
He knows that lamp costs $1,200.

14:28.056 --> 14:29.590
Anyway, while it's just us guys,

14:29.592 --> 14:32.777
let me ask you something:
we've all had that same fantasy

14:32.779 --> 14:36.864
about having sex with a girl in
a stormtrooper costume, right?

14:36.866 --> 14:39.533
- Mmm, no.
- Never.

14:39.535 --> 14:40.985
Guys...

14:40.987 --> 14:43.537
come on, no girls around,
just us bros.

14:43.539 --> 14:44.789
Safe space.

14:44.791 --> 14:47.441
Let's stop being polite
and start gettin' real.

14:48.327 --> 14:49.460
Stormtrooper fantasy.

14:49.462 --> 14:51.245
Every guy's had that one, right?

14:51.247 --> 14:53.881
Not even once, no.
No, no, no.

14:53.883 --> 14:56.634
So I'm the weird one?

14:56.636 --> 14:58.285
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:58.287 --> 14:59.587
Yeah.

14:59.589 --> 15:00.671
How about you, Ted?

15:00.673 --> 15:03.624
How's your life gonna
be different

15:03.626 --> 15:05.643
Oh, you know,
the usual.

15:05.645 --> 15:07.895
Gonna meet a nice girl
and get married.

15:07.897 --> 15:10.431
I mean, I know I say that
every year, but...

15:10.433 --> 15:13.267
let's be honest,
in 2012, I'll be 34.

15:13.269 --> 15:15.102
If it still hasn't
happened for me by then,

15:15.104 --> 15:19.190
something is seriously
wrong with me!

15:28.533 --> 15:32.770
Something is seriously wrong
with me.

15:37.387 --> 15:38.754
I can't do
this anymore.

15:38.756 --> 15:40.105
I can't
keep smiling

15:40.107 --> 15:41.840
and being optimistic
all the time

15:41.842 --> 15:44.009
when all the evidence
points to the contrary.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.228
You really think
that three years from now

15:46.230 --> 15:47.679
things aren't gonna be awesome?

15:47.681 --> 15:49.982
I'll tell you what
things are gonna be like

15:49.984 --> 15:52.000
three years from now.

15:53.136 --> 15:56.088
Uh, yes, hello. I see

15:56.090 --> 16:00.642
on my frozen entree for one
they printed this number

16:00.644 --> 16:03.345
where I can voice
comments and concerns.

16:03.347 --> 16:06.014
Well, there's more cinnamon

16:06.016 --> 16:08.884
in the cobbler than usual.

16:08.886 --> 16:11.253
No, I like cinnamon.

16:12.488 --> 16:16.692
Oh, you're very welcome
for my comment.

16:16.694 --> 16:20.262
Wait! Uh, don't go.

16:20.264 --> 16:22.931
Um... do you like cinnamon?

16:22.933 --> 16:24.983
Hello? Hello?

16:31.107 --> 16:33.859
Marshall, you want
to watch <i>Star Wars?</i>

16:33.861 --> 16:35.444
No, can do, old bean!

16:35.446 --> 16:36.928
You see, we're up on the Cape

16:36.930 --> 16:38.313
living the idyllic
family lifestyle

16:38.315 --> 16:39.764
that you've always
dreamed of.

16:39.766 --> 16:44.353
Oh, and I'm pregnant
with baby #5!

16:44.355 --> 16:46.321
But baby #4 isn't even out yet.

16:46.323 --> 16:48.073
I'm just that good!

16:48.075 --> 16:49.207
Oh, oh, hold on.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.942
There's somebody wants
to say hello to you.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.662
Hey, Ted.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.881
I just wanted to say
that things are great,

16:55.883 --> 16:58.900
and I'm married to that
douchey guy in the trucker hat.

16:58.902 --> 17:00.335
Whassup, bra?

17:01.471 --> 17:03.455
It turns out it was just <i>you</i>

17:03.457 --> 17:05.190
I didn't want to commit to.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.125
Oh,

17:07.127 --> 17:09.627
and I got back boobs.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.646
So things are great!

17:11.647 --> 17:12.948
Buh-bye!

17:17.771 --> 17:19.771
By the way, Ted,
this is Melanie.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.772
You'll be seeing a
lot more of Melanie.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.075
<i>Wait-wait-wait a minute!</i>

17:23.077 --> 17:24.409
Who is Melanie?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.494
Come on, Barney, if there's
one thing I can count on

17:26.497 --> 17:27.779
not to change,
it's you walking in

17:27.781 --> 17:29.364
with some random
girl on your arm.

17:29.366 --> 17:31.783
No. No, I don't want that.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.085
For the first time

17:33.087 --> 17:35.203
in my life, I don't
want to find myself

17:35.205 --> 17:37.172
in three years
with some random girl,

17:37.174 --> 17:39.157
no matter
how many boobs she has.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.893
I want to be with Quinn.

17:44.714 --> 17:46.664
Guys...

17:46.666 --> 17:48.884
you're gonna be seeing
a lot more of Quinn.

17:48.886 --> 17:51.353
Dude, we've been to the
Lusty Leopard. We've seen plenty.

17:51.355 --> 17:54.139
I kind of walked into that one.
All right, bye-bye.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.062
What are you doing?

18:01.064 --> 18:02.781
We're living together,
I'm excited about it,

18:02.783 --> 18:04.750
and I'm getting
rid of my mugs.

18:06.068 --> 18:07.319
That was mine.

18:07.321 --> 18:09.738
Sorry. I don't know
which are which.

18:09.740 --> 18:13.041
Truth is, I never
drink coffee at home.

18:13.043 --> 18:14.493
This one?
Mm-hmm.

18:14.495 --> 18:16.211
There!

18:16.213 --> 18:18.413
I don't need my coffee mugs
'cause I got yours!

18:18.415 --> 18:20.215
For the rest of my life.

18:20.217 --> 18:22.968
Or as... long as
you'll have me.

18:22.970 --> 18:25.220
We haven't really talked
about the future.

18:25.222 --> 18:27.372
Did I make things awkward?

18:27.374 --> 18:28.807
Just keep smashing mugs.

18:29.893 --> 18:32.260
Or donate them.

18:32.262 --> 18:34.095
Point is,

18:34.097 --> 18:37.015
I plan on being with you
for a long time.

18:37.017 --> 18:38.934
You okay with that?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.390
Sounds great.

18:47.443 --> 18:49.811
Ooh.. Oh!

18:51.330 --> 18:54.699
I am so sorry.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.951
No, no, it's great.

18:55.953 --> 18:59.087
A guy has to be the first one
to let 'er rip.

18:59.089 --> 19:01.173
I was actually hoping
this would happen soon.

19:01.175 --> 19:03.741
I've been crop-dusting
the patio for weeks.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.577
- The <i>patio!</i>
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.579
I've been going
out on the street,

19:07.581 --> 19:10.682
like, exactly this time
every night.

19:10.684 --> 19:13.185
Where are you, blond man?!

19:13.187 --> 19:15.554
Show yourself!

19:15.556 --> 19:18.523
I will be at my mother's.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.758
We're a real couple now,
aren't we?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.811
We are.

19:29.770 --> 19:32.654
Hey, buddy, I get
that you're bummed.

19:32.656 --> 19:35.773
But I got a good feeling
about 2015.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.076
I think that's
gonna be your year.

19:38.078 --> 19:41.046
<i>Kids, that was the one time</i>
<i>I ever lost faith</i>

19:41.048 --> 19:44.282
<i>in the idea that my life</i>
<i>would be better in three years.</i>

19:44.284 --> 19:47.219
<i>And what's funny is,</i>
<i>three years from that moment,</i>

19:47.221 --> 19:49.254
<i>my life was amazing.</i>

19:49.256 --> 19:50.839
All right!
It's trilogy time!

19:50.841 --> 19:52.624
Can I just lodge
one complaint?

19:52.626 --> 19:54.059
This is a guy's tradition.

19:54.061 --> 19:56.645
It's kind of a lame move
on Ted's part to bring a chick.

19:56.647 --> 19:59.231
Come on, dude...
cut him some slack.

19:59.233 --> 20:00.482
I know. He loves her.

20:00.484 --> 20:03.151
And I'll give him this:
she is pretty damn cute.

20:03.153 --> 20:05.570
Thank God she takes
after her mother.

20:05.572 --> 20:09.024
All right,
let's watch this thing!

20:09.026 --> 20:10.692
TV...

20:10.694 --> 20:14.979
play <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy.

20:16.582 --> 20:19.451
Play <i>Star Wars</i> tril...

20:19.453 --> 20:21.369
You know what?
Screw it.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.691
Okay, you are about to see
something awesome.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.493
And just know this:

20:28.495 --> 20:30.745
Han shot first.

20:32.048 --> 20:34.266
I wonder if things'll
be a lot different

20:34.268 --> 20:37.719
when we watch the trilogy
again in 2018.

20:37.721 --> 20:40.071
I hope not.

20:48.517 --> 20:50.884
Oh, that was awesome.

20:52.370 --> 20:54.321
You were right--
not weird.

20:54.346 --> 20:55.855
No.
