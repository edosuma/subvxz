00:16.967 --> 00:18.901

00:42.393 --> 00:49.031
(music)

00:49.033 --> 00:50.933
ANDY: That's part of living
out in the bush--

00:50.935 --> 00:54.570
you have to adapt to whatever
Mother Nature throws.

00:54.572 --> 00:56.405
And you try and stay
a step ahead of her,

00:56.407 --> 00:58.640
but most of the time
you're playing catch-up.

00:58.642 --> 01:03.612
(music)

01:03.614 --> 01:07.015
You got to be (bleep)
kidding me, man.

01:07.017 --> 01:09.918
Un-(bleep)-believable.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.253
I just came down here,

01:11.255 --> 01:14.556
and my boat that had a tank
of water in it isn't here,

01:14.558 --> 01:18.127
look like the stake,
the stake pulled out

01:18.129 --> 01:21.897
and it drifted off,
is what it looks like to me,

01:21.899 --> 01:24.366
and, ah, so I got to go
track down the boat.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.069
<i> NARRATOR: With currents</i>
<i> ripping through</i>

01:27.071 --> 01:29.071
<i> at up to 10 miles per hour,</i>

01:29.073 --> 01:33.342
<i> the boat can be anywhere</i>
<i> along the vast Yukon.</i>

01:33.344 --> 01:35.043
ANDY: I just want to get
(bleep) downriver

01:35.045 --> 01:36.745
so I can get my (bleep) boat
back up here

01:36.747 --> 01:39.214
before it ends up down
in (bleep) circle.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.452
Could be a hundred miles
downriver at this point.

01:43.454 --> 01:45.254
Come!

01:45.256 --> 01:46.722
Hup, hup.

01:46.724 --> 01:48.457
Good boy.

01:48.459 --> 01:51.660
I don't know when it got lost
or when it came out, so.

01:51.662 --> 01:57.432
(music)

01:57.434 --> 01:59.835
The Yukon River is our highway.

01:59.837 --> 02:02.905
In the summer months I use boats
every day on the Yukon.

02:02.907 --> 02:03.972
I do a lot of freighting.

02:03.974 --> 02:06.809
Large loads, unorthodox loads.

02:06.811 --> 02:08.076
Having boats to work with

02:08.078 --> 02:11.413
is critical to the way
we live down here.

02:11.415 --> 02:12.648
Last time this happened,

02:12.650 --> 02:17.019
my boat drifted
almost 70 miles downriver.

02:17.021 --> 02:19.621
That was on a windy day when
I would've expected the wind

02:19.623 --> 02:22.291
to ground it on the shoreline.

02:22.293 --> 02:23.926
It wasn't windy
at all last night,

02:23.928 --> 02:26.728
so I have no idea how far
this boat can drift

02:26.730 --> 02:28.897
before it's going to go aground.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.702
<i> NARRATOR: Not only is the boat</i>
<i> worth thousands of dollars,</i>

02:33.704 --> 02:36.538
<i> it's also carrying 300 gallons</i>
<i> of freshwater</i>

02:36.540 --> 02:40.776
<i> that Andy collected from</i>
<i> a creek just yesterday.</i>

02:40.778 --> 02:43.579
ANDY: In the wintertime
the Yukon River flows clear

02:43.581 --> 02:46.715
under the ice, and so
we're able to drill holes

02:46.717 --> 02:49.718
and scoop out water and haul it
up to the house with buckets.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.754
However, in the summertime,
a great deal of silt

02:52.756 --> 02:55.858
comes out of the glacial streams
from the mountain range,

02:55.860 --> 02:59.194
and that puts a tremendous
volume of silt into the Yukon.

02:59.196 --> 03:03.866
Right now there's about 2.2 tons
of silt going by per second.

03:03.868 --> 03:08.704
So it makes the water unpotable
for human drinking.

03:08.706 --> 03:10.339
That forces us to go upriver

03:10.341 --> 03:12.608
and get clear water
out of a clear stream.

03:14.011 --> 03:16.678
If I don't have that boat,
water doesn't get hauled,

03:16.680 --> 03:18.447
my gravel doesn't get hauled.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.982
My house doesn't get built.

03:19.984 --> 03:24.620
So, it's a pretty essential part
of my whole plan for the summer.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.755
I can't afford to lose a boat.

03:29.093 --> 03:30.659
<i> NARRATOR: Losing this</i>
<i> vital piece of equipment</i>

03:30.661 --> 03:33.595
<i> would be a huge blow</i>
<i> to Andy and his livelihood.</i>

03:33.597 --> 03:36.398
<i> But time isn't on Andy's side.</i>

03:36.400 --> 03:39.067
<i> He's got to find the boat</i>
<i> before his fuel runs out.</i>

03:39.069 --> 03:40.068
ANDY: I got a million projects

03:40.070 --> 03:41.570
I'm trying to get done
right now,

03:41.572 --> 03:43.438
and I got my schedules lined out

03:43.440 --> 03:45.274
on what I want to do
on what days,

03:45.276 --> 03:49.177
and something like this
unexpected comes up

03:49.179 --> 03:50.913
that I hadn't planned on,

03:50.915 --> 03:54.383
brings a lot of stress and
a lot of frustration for me.

03:54.385 --> 03:56.018
That's the life along the river,

03:56.020 --> 03:58.820
(bleep) happens,
you got to deal with it.

03:58.822 --> 04:05.460
(music)

04:05.462 --> 04:07.462
I'm switching gas tanks.

04:07.464 --> 04:12.301
Each tank of gas is 5 gallons at
about $5.50 to $6.00 a gallon.

04:12.303 --> 04:13.635
By the time I get it down to me,

04:13.637 --> 04:16.371
it's probably about
$7.00 a gallon.

04:16.373 --> 04:18.473
Depending on how far downriver
this boat goes,

04:18.475 --> 04:20.943
this is going to be
a fairly expensive trip

04:20.945 --> 04:23.712
for someone who doesn't
have a lot of money

04:23.714 --> 04:26.014
to spend on this kind of stuff.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.288
I'm a little irritated that
I got to spend this time today

04:33.290 --> 04:36.391
basically killing this day

04:36.393 --> 04:40.429
and a whole bunch of fuel
to go get a boat.

04:40.431 --> 04:43.031
Feeling a little bummed out
at myself for not checking it

04:43.033 --> 04:45.167
before I went to bed last night.

04:45.169 --> 04:48.804
Without it, I don't know
what I'll do.

04:48.806 --> 04:51.239
Hey, it looks like I might
see it up ahead here,

04:51.241 --> 04:56.144
two miles off,
beached against the bank.

04:57.581 --> 05:00.549
Kind of looks like it from here.

05:00.551 --> 05:04.753
It looks like the current
pushed it into this slough.

05:04.755 --> 05:06.755
<i> NARRATOR: Navigating</i>
<i> the shallows of the Yukon</i>

05:06.757 --> 05:08.623
<i> is a difficult challenge.</i>

05:08.625 --> 05:12.194
<i> One miscalculation and</i>
<i> Andy could lose both boats.</i>

05:12.196 --> 05:15.664
ANDY: Looks pretty shallow
in there where it's grounded.

05:15.666 --> 05:17.199
My biggest problem now
is gonna be

05:17.201 --> 05:20.869
if I can get my big boat here
into where that boat is.

05:20.871 --> 05:23.405
I don't want to hit bottom
with my prop too much,

05:23.407 --> 05:27.509
'cause A, I don't have my second
prop with me right now,

05:27.511 --> 05:30.178
and B, it's expensive.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.646
Not sure if I'm going to be able
to get into it

05:31.648 --> 05:33.648
with this boat or not.

05:35.185 --> 05:36.585
Look at that, I just,
my wake coming in

05:36.587 --> 05:38.787
just moved the boat again.

05:38.789 --> 05:42.190
(bleep) It's going down
into the shallows.

05:42.192 --> 05:46.128
(music)

05:46.130 --> 05:51.099
(music)

05:51.101 --> 05:57.239
(music)

05:57.241 --> 05:58.407
Every day you're out here

05:58.409 --> 06:00.409
you got to adapt
to something new.

06:00.411 --> 06:01.877
Good.

06:01.879 --> 06:05.247
It's an endless progression of
problem solving, compromising,

06:05.249 --> 06:08.617
MacGyvering things together
all the time.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.620
That's life in
the Alaska bush: adapt.

06:13.257 --> 06:16.925
First thing I'm going to have
to do is pump this tank dry

06:16.927 --> 06:19.895
to lighten that boat up,
and make it a shallower draft,

06:19.897 --> 06:23.231
so I can line it back
up the slough here.

06:27.104 --> 06:29.604
<i> NARRATOR: The 300 gallons</i>
<i> of freshwater on board</i>

06:29.606 --> 06:32.841
<i> is an essential resource,</i>

06:32.843 --> 06:35.110
<i> but in order to pull the boat</i>
<i> from the shallows,</i>

06:35.112 --> 06:37.846
<i> Andy will have to dump it all.</i>

06:37.848 --> 06:38.847
ANDY: This kind of sucks.

06:43.187 --> 06:45.754
The challenge here is how do I
get both of these boats back out

06:45.756 --> 06:49.024
of this shallow area
over to the Yukon?

06:49.026 --> 06:51.560
I've got about 100 yards
of really shallow water

06:51.562 --> 06:54.529
between me and where
the Yukon's flowing.

06:54.531 --> 06:56.765
It's a hard rock bottom that
will really mess up my prop

06:56.767 --> 06:58.500
if I touch bottom.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.001
And if you don't get your prop
in very far,

07:00.003 --> 07:01.769
you don't have much
pulling power,

07:01.771 --> 07:03.238
so it's going to be
a bit of a challenge

07:03.240 --> 07:05.507
to figure how to get this out.

07:05.509 --> 07:09.845
I might have to just tie
a rope to my big boat.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.948
Once I get going out away
from the shallow area here,

07:12.950 --> 07:14.516
I should be able
to get enough line

07:14.518 --> 07:18.253
to hook onto this one
and tow it out.

07:18.255 --> 07:20.255
(music)

07:20.257 --> 07:25.293

07:25.295 --> 07:27.329
JESSIE: This is how I go out
and relax in the summers.

07:27.331 --> 07:30.432
I go out and get
prepared for winter.

07:30.434 --> 07:31.566
<i> NARRATOR: In Nenana,</i>

07:31.568 --> 07:33.668
<i> Jessie Holmes relies</i>
<i> on a fish wheel</i>

07:33.670 --> 07:35.537
<i> to get enough fish</i>
<i> to feed himself</i>

07:35.539 --> 07:38.073
<i> and his team of sled dogs.</i>

07:38.075 --> 07:39.541
JESSIE: Alright,
so fish are here,

07:39.543 --> 07:42.744
and it's time to go catch some.

07:45.015 --> 07:46.481
I got these dogs.

07:46.483 --> 07:48.250
It's a heck of a lot better
when I got fish for 'em,

07:48.252 --> 07:50.152
and I don't have
to buy dog food.

07:50.154 --> 07:52.521
<i> NARRATOR: After getting his</i>
<i> fish wheel into the current,</i>

07:52.523 --> 07:54.890
<i> Jessie must now get</i>
<i> the wheel operational</i>

07:54.892 --> 07:57.626
<i> to take advantage of</i>
<i> the summer chum salmon run.</i>

08:00.197 --> 08:02.497
<i> It's critical that</i>
<i> the gear works perfectly,</i>

08:02.499 --> 08:05.767
<i> or he and his dogs</i>
<i> could go hungry.</i>

08:05.769 --> 08:07.269
JESSIE: This is a fish wheel,

08:07.271 --> 08:09.137
and it's used to catch
large amounts of salmon

08:09.139 --> 08:10.438
during their peak runs,

08:10.440 --> 08:13.175
which right now, the summer chum
are in their peak run.

08:13.177 --> 08:17.712
I got to get this big, heavy-ass
fish wheel downriver eight feet,

08:17.714 --> 08:21.850
and then I got to push it out
into the river about 15 feet,

08:21.852 --> 08:22.918
so I can get it to the depth

08:22.920 --> 08:25.787
that I can drop
the baskets down.

08:25.789 --> 08:29.024
Time to get my spar log
attached here.

08:29.026 --> 08:32.494
A spar log is the log
that you anchor to the raft

08:32.496 --> 08:35.197
and you use to push the wheel
out into the current.

08:35.199 --> 08:40.468
(music)

08:40.470 --> 08:42.304
This is a lot of work
for one man.

08:42.306 --> 08:44.506
Everything's heavy
and heavy-duty

08:44.508 --> 08:46.641
when it comes to
fish wheels, so.

08:49.046 --> 08:50.478
You got to be in really good
physical shape

08:50.480 --> 08:53.481
to do these things.

08:53.483 --> 08:55.984
This is anchoring the spar log
to the raft here.

08:58.222 --> 09:00.455
This fish wheel is in pretty
bad condition, you know?

09:00.457 --> 09:01.656
But once it's dropped down

09:01.658 --> 09:04.092
it should still work
and catch fish.

09:04.094 --> 09:08.597
But you know, not really that
safe working on this thing.

09:11.668 --> 09:13.001
Once I get these
secured on there,

09:13.003 --> 09:14.336
I can start pushing
this fish wheel out there,

09:14.338 --> 09:16.638
and then I'll be able
to see some action.

09:16.640 --> 09:22.644

09:22.646 --> 09:25.247
Just a one step at a time
kind of thing, you know?

09:25.249 --> 09:30.619
(music)

09:30.621 --> 09:34.923
So far I think this is going
better than ever, possibly.

running, right?

10:16.333 --> 10:17.766
(chuckles)

10:17.768 --> 10:22.370
I was going across and I was
gonna put a choker up on this,

10:22.372 --> 10:25.440
and start pulling it,

10:25.442 --> 10:27.509
and the rope that
I had tied there,

10:27.511 --> 10:30.345
hanging on to a piece of wood
that was kind of minimal and...

10:30.347 --> 10:31.680
broke!

10:31.682 --> 10:34.482
I ran off of it, no problem.

10:34.484 --> 10:35.984
This is dangerous stuff
out here.

10:35.986 --> 10:38.086
I'm just really hoping that,

10:38.088 --> 10:39.654
you know, this thing
catches some fish.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.727
Everything's looking
really good.

11:20.564 --> 11:22.764
I got my boat back.

11:22.766 --> 11:26.668
This boat's absolutely critical
to me in the summertime.

11:26.670 --> 11:30.271
Pretty important piece
of equipment not to be losing.

11:30.273 --> 11:34.609
I almost always tie my boats up
with two lines.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.913
Just didn't do it last night
and I'm paying the price.

11:38.915 --> 11:42.884
I'm a long ways from home
right now.

11:42.886 --> 11:44.285
Really need to get back home,

11:44.287 --> 11:48.957
so I can get back onto my
projects and get back to work.

11:48.959 --> 11:53.995
A bit frustrating,
but all in a day, I guess.

ANDY: All in all,
I'm feeling pretty good now.

12:00.237 --> 12:03.271
And I can assure you, I have
two lines on it right now.

12:03.273 --> 12:09.210

12:09.212 --> 12:10.979
JESSIE: It's not like
it's just one task up here.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.814
It's multitasking all the time.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.783
Make two jobs out of one.

12:14.785 --> 12:16.785
(music)

12:16.787 --> 12:23.258
(music)

12:23.260 --> 12:24.692
It started nicely and straight,

12:24.694 --> 12:28.797
so nothing's fallen
to pieces yet.

12:28.799 --> 12:31.566
I can't believe I got it

Fish dinner.

12:44.915 --> 12:48.082

13:08.705 --> 13:11.473
It's a major, heavy thing.

13:11.475 --> 13:14.008
It's a major operation
to run one of these things.

13:14.010 --> 13:19.047
Something is always breaking
and needing fixed and repaired.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.715
Oh, (bleep).

13:20.717 --> 13:25.420
The axle sleeve slipped off
of the axle.

13:25.422 --> 13:27.155
And fish are running right now.

13:27.157 --> 13:29.991
And done a lot of work already.

13:29.993 --> 13:34.395
Maybe after my accident there,
I'll get it down this time.

ANDY: You want to go

13:57.654 --> 14:00.021
Who wants to go get wood?
Just a short run.

14:00.023 --> 14:03.157
I woke up this morning,
it was about 30 below zero.

14:03.159 --> 14:06.394
Went out to my power shack,
and I got no wood.

14:06.396 --> 14:09.864
I like getting firewood with
the dogs as much as possible,

14:09.866 --> 14:11.132
especially when it's colder out.

14:11.134 --> 14:13.535
The machines are a pain
in the butt to deal with.

14:13.537 --> 14:15.136
The dogs are always reliable.

14:15.138 --> 14:16.638
It's good exercise for the dogs,

14:16.640 --> 14:19.107
and I just like the dogs
better than the machines,

14:19.109 --> 14:22.010
it's just way, way more fun
with the dogs.

14:23.413 --> 14:24.846
Thatta boys!

14:24.848 --> 14:28.316
Little more,
gee, gee, gee, gee, gee!

14:28.318 --> 14:30.151
Come on! Hup, hup, hup!

14:30.153 --> 14:32.287
Hup, let's go, hup, hup, hup.

14:36.159 --> 14:38.226
Ho! Ho!

14:38.228 --> 14:42.530
It's either cut wood or go get
a job, make money, and buy oil.

14:42.532 --> 14:44.666
I'd much rather go cut wood.

14:46.269 --> 14:48.369
Well, this tree's leaning
definitely the wrong way,

14:48.371 --> 14:49.470
but at least I don't
have to worry about it

14:49.472 --> 14:51.906
dropping on the dogs.

14:51.908 --> 14:53.908
(chainsaw roaring)

14:53.910 --> 14:59.514
(music)

14:59.516 --> 15:01.015
Well, that kind of sucks.

15:01.017 --> 15:03.484
When trees are leaning,
they can only go one direction,

15:03.486 --> 15:05.853
so you're at the mercy
of the lean of the tree.

15:05.855 --> 15:12.727
(music)

15:12.729 --> 15:16.264
(music)

15:19.469 --> 15:22.737
Trees hang up,
sometimes multiple times.

15:22.739 --> 15:25.740
And it makes for
a lot more work.

15:27.644 --> 15:29.911
Ha ha ha! Woo-hoo!

15:32.382 --> 15:33.948
I dropped I think four trees,

15:33.950 --> 15:37.185
just to try and get it to where
I could cut it up for firewood.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.953
I'll get back in there
and stumble around

15:38.955 --> 15:41.456
and try and get the rest
of the wood another day.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.893
Huh!

15:47.764 --> 15:52.333
150, 100 pounds, 150 pounds,
it's not too bad.

15:52.335 --> 15:55.203
This will be enough wood
for probably five days.

15:57.173 --> 16:03.544

16:05.248 --> 16:06.214
Hup, hup!

16:08.118 --> 16:10.952
Ho, ho, whoa, ho! Perfect.

16:10.954 --> 16:13.087
I'm gonna load this thing
to the max.

16:13.089 --> 16:14.422
We don't have too far to go,

16:14.424 --> 16:17.425
I'm only about a mile and a half
or so from the house.

16:17.427 --> 16:18.793
Okay. Hup, hup.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.397

16:50.310 --> 16:52.877
Woo!

16:52.879 --> 16:54.946
Stay, stay, stay.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.850
Phew, man.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.520
Bit of a bump at the bottom
of the hill I wasn't expecting.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.188
Hopefully no harm done.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.692
I heard something pop
when I hit the bottom.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.594
You guys did a good job
of stopping for me.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.595
Good boys.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.597
I'm lucky the dogs
stopped for me.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.098
I didn't want to have
to walk home.

17:14.100 --> 17:18.736
So I'll keep on going here
and drop this load,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.671
then come back and
get another load.

17:47.434 --> 17:52.270

17:52.272 --> 17:54.839
Trying to get my sleeve
back on this axle,

17:54.841 --> 17:57.508
and it's not going
very smoothly so far.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.579
Every year, I'm constantly doing
maintenance to this thing.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.248
It's an old wheel,
it's been through hell,

18:04.250 --> 18:06.184
it's been in the water
its whole life,

18:06.186 --> 18:10.121
and it's gonna go back
in the water when it's done.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.623
I'm about to have to try to
figure something else out here.

18:12.625 --> 18:17.929
(music)

18:17.931 --> 18:18.996
I'm gonna try to put
the spike in there

18:18.998 --> 18:20.331
and see if I can't
get it picked up,

18:20.333 --> 18:21.566
put it on a block of wood

18:21.568 --> 18:22.934
to where I can get my sleeve
under it somehow.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.706
I went to the Tanana River
University of Fish Wheels.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.041
You got to make the best
of what you've got

18:30.043 --> 18:31.676
and what's at hand, you know.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.778
It's not like I'm gonna go
to a hardware store

18:33.780 --> 18:36.347
and buy new pieces for this
when it's right here, you know,

18:36.349 --> 18:38.216
or right on the riverbank.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.653
I'm gonna try to make
a little block of wood

18:42.655 --> 18:44.088
with a saddle in it,

18:44.090 --> 18:46.757
so if I can get this thing up
I can set it back down on this.

18:46.759 --> 18:50.394
Some people might be liking to
be idealistic and simplistic,

18:50.396 --> 18:51.729
but I'll tell you one thing,

18:51.731 --> 18:55.533
up in Alaska, you ain't nothing
without a chainsaw.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.302
Everything I do
demands a chainsaw.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.440
I'm not sure whether
this is plan C or D.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.574

19:19.459 --> 19:20.992

19:20.994 --> 19:24.562
I'm trying to time this, 'cause
there's only a certain rotation

19:24.564 --> 19:27.098
that I can get
this spike hooked on,

19:27.100 --> 19:29.734
and if it goes past it, it just
gets tight and falls off.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.402
I'm trying to get this block
underneath there,

19:31.404 --> 19:33.070
and that'll work if
I can get it under there.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.805
Then we can get
this thing going.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.708

just won't last for too long,

in there, so.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.571
There's another fish,
so it might be working out.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.707
That's what I'm talking about,
chum money.

20:42.709 --> 20:46.877
Yeah, go right in there! That's
right! Two fish. Two fish down.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.580
I'd say for the amount
of dogs I got,

20:49.582 --> 20:53.484
once we got 17 fish in there,
we'll be cooking, baby.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.789
I'm gonna have myself
a little snack here.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.795
That's some rich food
right there.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.764
That'll keep you going.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.200
Nice to have
a little rich snack.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.668
Straight up from the land.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.336

21:27.553 --> 21:29.787

The dogs are quick, reliable,
and they do the job.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.281
Plus, they have fun.

You don't put the time in
with the training,

22:03.222 --> 22:04.588
you don't get much out of 'em.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.924
It's not just physical
conditioning training

22:06.926 --> 22:08.726
that's important,
there's a lot of training

22:08.728 --> 22:12.997
that goes into discipline,
behavioral issues.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.066
If your dogs behave well,
then you take 'em everywhere

22:15.068 --> 22:16.100
and you do more with 'em.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.568
If they're always misbehaving,

22:17.570 --> 22:21.539
then it defeats the purpose to
take 'em into the bush with you.

I felt the sled starting to give
way on me, so I just let go.

23:02.832 --> 23:05.666
Bailed because I was afraid
I was gonna fall off.

23:05.668 --> 23:07.301
The sled continued on
with the dogs,

23:07.303 --> 23:08.769
it was crashing and banging,

23:08.771 --> 23:13.174
and eventually it slammed into
a chunk of ice, flipped over.

23:13.176 --> 23:16.377
Anybody here get hurt?
You guys okay?

23:16.379 --> 23:17.812
You were just going
like the wind!

23:17.814 --> 23:19.080
Holy crap, man!

23:21.350 --> 23:22.917
Holy (bleep).

23:22.919 --> 23:25.419
Plastic shouldn't do that,
but it looks like

23:25.421 --> 23:28.756
it's, it's just getting
kind of old and brittle.

23:28.758 --> 23:30.825
I don't know if I can
get this home like this.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.327
I'm gonna just unload
the sled here,

23:33.329 --> 23:35.162
maybe take one log for my fire,

23:35.164 --> 23:39.133
and then lighten the load up
and try and get it home.

23:39.135 --> 23:40.868
Stay.

23:40.870 --> 23:42.169
I don't want to come home
empty-handed

23:42.171 --> 23:43.971
'cause I'm out of wood.

23:43.973 --> 23:49.343
A fast, easy wood trip's turning
into a bit of an ordeal here.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.212
Man, lost my sled twice today.

23:51.214 --> 23:52.613
(laughs)

23:52.615 --> 23:56.350
Man, I don't think I ever seen
one blow apart like that.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.718
Alright, easy, you guys, easy.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.855
Gambo, easy, man, easy.

24:03.126 --> 24:04.225
That wasn't too bad.

24:04.227 --> 24:06.227
The sled didn't come
to an abrupt stop,

24:06.229 --> 24:09.630
but I've had 'em crash before
where it comes to an abrupt stop

24:09.632 --> 24:13.701
and I've had dogs rip right out
of their harnesses before.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.936
And that's not good for the dog.

24:15.938 --> 24:18.139
Good boys. Haw, haw. Haw, haw.

24:18.141 --> 24:21.108
Haw, haw. Haw, haw.

24:21.110 --> 24:22.910
What a mess.

24:22.912 --> 24:24.445
Something good came of it.

24:24.447 --> 24:26.380
Got a couple pieces of wood
for my fire,

24:26.382 --> 24:29.283
that'll get me a couple hours.

24:29.285 --> 24:32.353
I don't know, I'm gonna have to
bring this into my shop

24:32.355 --> 24:37.024
and really go over it, but
I mean, it's, it's smucked.

24:37.026 --> 24:39.260
I mean, it's gone. Look at that.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.063
It's pretty much toast.

24:43.065 --> 24:46.066
This is a total rebuild.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.535
Alright, you guys did
a good job.

24:47.537 --> 24:49.069
That was me.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.604
I'm the one who screwed that,

24:50.606 --> 24:53.140
I'm the dumbass today, because
today you were a good anchor.

24:53.142 --> 24:54.742
I saw you stop everybody.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.311
You're such a good boy!

25:03.586 --> 25:07.855

25:07.857 --> 25:09.990
JESSIE: Setting down here
to check the fish wheel.

25:09.992 --> 25:11.859
It's been running all night.

25:11.861 --> 25:14.261
The season is coming
close to an end.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.330
I need a lot of fish
going into the winter.

25:16.332 --> 25:18.299
The winter is long up here.

25:18.301 --> 25:19.833
Oh, it's looking like
it's running.

25:19.835 --> 25:21.468
You know, the lead's
all in place,

25:21.470 --> 25:23.003
that's an important thing,

25:23.005 --> 25:26.073
it ain't gonna catch no fish
if it ain't in place.

25:26.075 --> 25:28.309
Oh, I see a lot of fish
right there.

25:28.311 --> 25:30.511
It's looking great.

25:30.513 --> 25:32.146
Wow, it's looking better
than I expected.

25:32.148 --> 25:33.614
Ho.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.316
There's a fish right there.

25:35.318 --> 25:36.617
Wow.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.118
This is a lot of fish,

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
and that could feed my dogs
for a long time.

25:44.026 --> 25:46.560
I know one thing,
I'm gonna have some happy dogs.

25:49.932 --> 25:52.666
I'll use about 18 a day,
20 sometimes.

25:52.668 --> 25:55.603
So, that's, you know,
days of feed for my dogs.

25:57.340 --> 25:59.306
This is what it's
all about for me.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.076
You suffer a lot of hard times
and lean times out here,

26:02.078 --> 26:04.245
so when it's good,
man, you're excited.

26:04.247 --> 26:06.580
You just, you realize
how lucky you are

26:06.582 --> 26:10.150
to be doing something like this.

26:10.152 --> 26:14.755
I'm gonna throw this last one
on here, 177.

26:14.757 --> 26:17.091
So now I got to haul
all these up to my house

26:17.093 --> 26:19.927
on the Nenana River and get to
work, you know, moving them

26:19.929 --> 26:22.830
and getting them to where
they're gonna be for the winter.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.798
Fishing is nothing but work.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.502
But whenever it pays off, it's
the best feeling you could have.

26:30.940 --> 26:32.673
ANDY: It's up early,
to bed late,

26:32.675 --> 26:34.875
eat lots of aspirin,
keep on going.

26:36.912 --> 26:39.680
<i> NARRATOR: After crashing twice</i>

26:39.682 --> 26:42.883

26:47.857 --> 26:50.257

26:50.259 --> 26:52.860
ANDY: I got the sled inside
to do an inspection on it.

26:52.862 --> 26:57.164
Brush bow's totally destroyed,
plastic's totally destroyed,

26:57.166 --> 26:58.866
delaminating runners.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.468
The more I took apart,
the more I found wrong with it.

27:01.470 --> 27:04.271
I think it's gonna be quicker
for me to build a whole new sled

27:04.273 --> 27:07.408
than to try and do repairs
and then rebuild this sled.

27:07.410 --> 27:08.776
When I started this morning,

27:08.778 --> 27:12.212
I had no idea I was gonna be
building a new sled.

27:12.214 --> 27:16.483
(music)

27:16.485 --> 27:18.018
Alaskans are very unique people.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.353
We're all very independent,

27:19.355 --> 27:21.588
especially people
living out in the bush.

27:21.590 --> 27:25.192
We're all very inventive,
tough, hearty souls

27:25.194 --> 27:26.794
that want to take care
of themselves.

27:26.796 --> 27:32.533
(music)

27:32.535 --> 27:34.335
Yeah, I'm just about done.

27:34.337 --> 27:39.173
This is the final thing to do,
this is called the bridle.

27:39.175 --> 27:43.143
This is what the dogs
pull the sled with,

27:43.145 --> 27:46.914
and hopefully I don't have to do
this again for a while.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.949
Looks pretty good.

27:48.951 --> 27:50.517
It's fairly light.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.755
It's a, it's a little more than
a one-handed sled,

27:54.757 --> 27:58.992
but I'm guessing maybe
30, 35 pounds maybe.

27:58.994 --> 28:03.230
Kind of a frustrating
chain of events today.

28:03.232 --> 28:06.500
Losing the sled, busting it up,
but I'm gonna have a new sled.

28:06.502 --> 28:07.768
I'm gonna have something
that will last me

28:07.770 --> 28:09.670
for five or six years.

28:09.672 --> 28:12.072
There's a silver lining
in every dark cloud.

28:12.074 --> 28:14.208
Once your head gets
wrapped around that,

28:14.210 --> 28:15.843
you just get on with the job.

28:15.845 --> 28:17.911
Let's test it out.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.013
Woo-hoo!

28:20.015 --> 28:26.420

28:26.422 --> 28:27.454
JESSIE: The more you grow
out here,

28:27.456 --> 28:29.423

(music)

28:31.394 --> 28:36.830

28:36.832 --> 28:38.665
I'll be building
a new rack system

28:38.667 --> 28:41.402
that I can hopefully hang
a thousand fish on.

28:41.404 --> 28:44.738
So, I can just take those fish
right off of it, they're ready.

28:44.740 --> 28:47.674
And juo lessen my workload,
make more space.

28:47.676 --> 28:49.376
<i> NARRATOR: Creating a fish rack</i>
<i> will allow Jessie</i>

28:49.378 --> 28:53.414
<i> to dry, smoke, and preserve</i>
<i> large quantities of fish.</i>

<i> The meat will provide him</i>

28:55.284 --> 28:58.185
<i> with enough protein</i>
<i> for the long winter.</i>

28:58.187 --> 29:00.053
JESSIE: I need to start
collecting some poles.

29:00.055 --> 29:03.624
And I'm gonna put 'em off with
some barrels in a level area.

29:03.626 --> 29:05.793
And start filling it up
with some fish.

29:08.264 --> 29:10.130
I'm not an idealist out here.

29:10.132 --> 29:11.799
I'm a realist.

29:11.801 --> 29:14.902
If it means using a chainsaw
over a bow saw,

29:14.904 --> 29:17.271
that's the way I'm gonna do it.

29:17.273 --> 29:19.072
Waste time doing things
the hard way,

29:19.074 --> 29:21.241
then you miss out on
a lot of opportunities.

29:24.046 --> 29:26.013
Time is of the essence.

29:26.015 --> 29:28.582
It's imperative that I get these
fish put up for the winter,

29:28.584 --> 29:30.317
it really enables my lifestyle.

29:30.319 --> 29:33.454
This is a huge part of my
lifestyle to have these fish.

29:33.456 --> 29:35.923
It fuels my dogs
and it fuels me.

29:38.327 --> 29:40.894
This is pretty much what
it's gonna look like.

29:40.896 --> 29:44.932
I'll be rolling these
and spacing these,

29:44.934 --> 29:48.602
even enough apart that I can fit
about five fish per alder pole.

29:48.604 --> 29:50.637
I'm looking to not go
too far of a span,

29:50.639 --> 29:52.139
because I don't want it
to bend and break

29:52.141 --> 29:54.741
and be under the strain
of too many fish,

29:54.743 --> 29:57.211
so I'm just trying to fit in
this rectangle what I can.

29:57.213 --> 30:01.248
I'll have 125 fish per row,
and nine rows,

30:01.250 --> 30:04.351
so I'll have over a thousand
fish hanging on this,

30:04.353 --> 30:05.752
which is gonna be cool.

30:09.425 --> 30:10.724
It's time to hang some fish

30:10.726 --> 30:13.727
and try to fit as many in there
as I possibly can.

30:13.729 --> 30:18.465
As much as my rack can hold is
the work I got cut out for me.

30:18.467 --> 30:19.666
I'm just going for it,

30:19.668 --> 30:22.035
'cause time's everything to me
right now.

30:23.806 --> 30:25.172
This is it.

30:25.174 --> 30:27.574
This is my opportunity to
put up fish for the winter.

30:30.145 --> 30:32.346
Got a lot of dogs,
need a lot of fish.

30:32.348 --> 30:34.114
Got to do it right.

30:34.116 --> 30:36.583
50 dogs, there's no such thing
as too much fish.

(bleep)

31:11.320 --> 31:16.390
(music)

31:16.392 --> 31:19.726
Well, it's a hard lesson that's
gonna cost me a lot of work,

31:19.728 --> 31:21.628
but it will probably stick
in my mind, you know?

31:21.630 --> 31:25.632
It's, I don't think that plastic
barrel helped me too much there,

31:25.634 --> 31:28.435
could have had more barrels
maybe and more supports,

31:28.437 --> 31:29.436
and some weight.

31:29.438 --> 31:30.637
Think I cut a shortcut,

31:30.639 --> 31:34.708
because the metal barrel's
heavier to carry.

31:34.710 --> 31:37.578
And this is what
(bleep) happens.

31:37.580 --> 31:40.714
I'm gonna load all this fish
on the tarp.

31:40.716 --> 31:43.417
Still just really thankful
to have this fish.

31:43.419 --> 31:45.752
This is a very valuable
resource.

31:47.556 --> 31:50.457
This is costing me
valuable time,

31:50.459 --> 31:53.427
that I need to be out there on
the river putting on more fish.

31:53.429 --> 31:56.830
Takes a lot of pounds of meat
to feed these dogs.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.833
So, while this is a lot of fish

31:59.835 --> 32:02.536
and it makes me feel good
to have it,

32:02.538 --> 32:05.706
I don't want to waste time,
thinking I got it made,

32:05.708 --> 32:07.741
'cause you don't
ever got it made.

32:07.743 --> 32:09.242
You can't be complacent.

32:09.244 --> 32:10.544
And when I put this
back together,

32:10.546 --> 32:12.846
I'll just put it back
together stronger.

32:15.284 --> 32:17.618
And count it a lesson learned.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.190
I got these fish.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.858
They're ready to go
back on these racks.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.693
Racks just need to be
thrown back together

32:26.695 --> 32:28.895
a little bit more securely.

32:28.897 --> 32:30.497
Fish got to be moved again.

32:30.499 --> 32:33.700
This task is mostly done, so
it's definitely gonna get done.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.035
I have no choice
but to get it done.

32:35.037 --> 32:38.405
I don't start something
and not finish it.

Topey, want to go?

33:01.196 --> 33:02.896
I'm gonna go out and
do some beaver trapping.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.298
That's something I've done
almost every year

33:05.300 --> 33:07.134
since I've lived up here.

33:07.136 --> 33:09.002
Hup, hup!

33:09.004 --> 33:11.672

early springtime comes,

33:11.674 --> 33:14.107
I want to get out
and trap a few beavers,

33:14.109 --> 33:16.443
get a little food,
get a little fur,

33:16.445 --> 33:18.178
and just enjoy
the sun coming back

33:18.180 --> 33:21.615
after seven months of darkness.

33:21.617 --> 33:23.550
Oh!

33:23.552 --> 33:24.985
Alright!

33:24.987 --> 33:26.586
Good boys.

33:28.323 --> 33:32.592
Well, this is, this is a spot
where I've trapped before,

33:32.594 --> 33:34.294
but I've had problems
finding water.

33:34.296 --> 33:36.563
If I don't have water,
I'm kind of screwed here.

33:36.565 --> 33:39.466
If I got water, I got
a chance of making sets.

33:39.468 --> 33:42.669
I can punch through the ice
in a couple of different places,

33:42.671 --> 33:43.837
see how deep it is.

33:43.839 --> 33:45.939
If I'm lucky,
I'll find the feed pile.

33:48.877 --> 33:51.144
Most important thing is I need
to have some water

33:51.146 --> 33:54.948
between the bottom of the ice
and the bottom of the lake.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.217
You need an area there where
the beavers can swim in

33:57.219 --> 33:59.319
and get caught in your traps.

34:02.825 --> 34:04.558
That's half the battle
right there.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.893
Now, I got to see
how thick the ice is

34:06.895 --> 34:08.628
and how deep the water is.

34:08.630 --> 34:13.333
(music)

34:13.335 --> 34:15.802
Got about eight, eight,
nine inches.

34:15.804 --> 34:20.140
So it's not ideal, but I think
it'll work right here.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.875
I'm just gonna set a Conibear.

34:21.877 --> 34:23.443
I didn't make the hole
really big

34:23.445 --> 34:26.113
for doing a lot
of snares on this.

34:26.115 --> 34:27.681
And Conibears are
really positive,

34:27.683 --> 34:30.584
if you, if you nail one, you
nail 'em good with a Conibear.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.322
I have to just take
a chance here.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.057
See, right now,
I got no safety on,

34:37.059 --> 34:40.227
and if that trigger goes off,
the whole thing goes off on me.

34:44.399 --> 34:46.333
Alright, I think
that might work.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.301
(music)

34:48.303 --> 34:54.207
(music)

34:54.209 --> 35:00.914
(music)

35:00.916 --> 35:02.215
I think that's gonna work.

35:02.217 --> 35:05.118
(barking)

35:05.120 --> 35:09.890
Pack up some of my stuff,
go to the next spot.

35:09.892 --> 35:11.224
Stay!

35:11.226 --> 35:13.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:13.829 --> 35:16.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Settle down!

35:22.871 --> 35:23.770
(sighs)

35:23.772 --> 35:28.675
(music)

35:28.677 --> 35:33.480
(music)

35:33.482 --> 35:34.648
I'm (bleep).

35:34.650 --> 35:35.982
(chuckles)

35:35.984 --> 35:37.150
When they went to turn around,

35:37.152 --> 35:38.818
the back of the runner
slid down in that crack,

35:38.820 --> 35:40.821
and they just snapped the end
of the runner off.

35:40.823 --> 35:43.857
I could see it happening,
I just couldn't stop the dogs.

35:43.859 --> 35:45.458
Once you destroy a runner,

35:45.460 --> 35:47.394
you pretty much have to take
the whole sled apart,

35:47.396 --> 35:49.563
replace the entire
sets of runners,

35:49.565 --> 35:51.398
you can't just replace one.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.234
So it's basically like
starting all over again.

35:54.236 --> 35:55.702
I'm just gonna turn around
and go home.

35:55.704 --> 35:59.005
And that's the end of it
for today.

36:01.343 --> 36:03.510
Coug, we're going home.

36:07.015 --> 36:12.252
(barking)

36:12.254 --> 36:14.087
I didn't want to go
and set the beaver traps

36:14.089 --> 36:16.389
and then be coming home
late at night in the dark,

36:16.391 --> 36:17.924
and I had no idea how well

36:17.926 --> 36:19.960
the runners were gonna
hold together.

36:19.962 --> 36:22.562
Pretty much had to stand on
one runner the whole way back.

36:22.564 --> 36:25.165
Oh, I'll transfer all this
over to a smaller sled,

36:25.167 --> 36:28.935
and I just built a new sled,
and it's a good little sled.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.470
It just doesn't handle the same.

36:30.472 --> 36:32.606
It's really squirrely.

36:32.608 --> 36:35.175
I'll go back out tomorrow and
try and finish making sets

36:35.177 --> 36:37.978
and take a night
to think about it,

36:37.980 --> 36:40.747
and get over being disappointed,

36:40.749 --> 36:42.916
and hopefully I won't do the
same thing to the other sled,

36:42.918 --> 36:44.417
'cause then I'm out of sleds.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.619
(chuckles)

36:45.621 --> 36:48.622
Just a disappointing day.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.857
But that's the way
it goes sometimes.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.328

to live up here,

36:55.330 --> 36:57.597

37:08.844 --> 37:10.343
Would have been nice to have
finished that in one day,

37:10.345 --> 37:14.514
but now we got good six inches
of snow to add to the mix.

37:27.896 --> 37:29.329
this whole project over again.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.198
I'm just trying to rectify
the balance problem that I had.

37:32.200 --> 37:36.202
And then I just pick these
fish up and slap 'em on here.

37:36.204 --> 37:38.505
And I'm behind right now.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.941
If I don't keep moving,
I'm gonna be way behind.

37:40.943 --> 37:43.677
For me, fear is, fear of failure

37:43.679 --> 37:46.846
is probably the greatest
fear for me.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.249
'Cause right now
I have so much on the line,

37:49.251 --> 37:51.918
and I've invested so much.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.353
Hopefully this'll set up
a little bit

37:53.355 --> 37:56.890
and help it from kicking out.

Oh, God.

JESSIE: Whoa.

38:07.903 --> 38:09.302
Oh, God.

38:11.006 --> 38:13.306
That tree's gonna break and fall
right on this rack

38:13.308 --> 38:15.108
and destroy all my hard work.

38:15.110 --> 38:16.242
I got to take a look at it

38:16.244 --> 38:18.078
and see if I can safely
get it down somehow

38:18.080 --> 38:20.613
without hitting the rack.

but it's for a greater cause.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.575
Alright. This looks great.

This is gonna hold.

39:24.346 --> 39:26.646
I've got, you know,
nearly a thousand fish here.

39:26.648 --> 39:29.883
So, you know, I achieved
what I wanted to achieve.

39:29.885 --> 39:31.418
I had some hardships
along the way,

39:31.420 --> 39:34.521
but it's just a lesson
in perseverance, you know?

39:34.523 --> 39:35.688
When things aren't going good,

39:35.690 --> 39:37.323
that's when you got
to step up, man.

39:37.325 --> 39:39.225
You got to step up
and get it done.

39:39.227 --> 39:41.327
My mind can rest that
I accomplished this.

39:41.329 --> 39:43.463
And I can move
on to the next job,

39:43.465 --> 39:46.099
which now that the snow
is coming, is many.

40:07.189 --> 40:08.755
Great day yesterday,
up until the point

40:08.757 --> 40:11.658
where I schmucked a runner up
on the sled.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.559
Whoa!

40:12.561 --> 40:15.161
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Settle down!

40:15.163 --> 40:16.830
Pretty frustrating.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.465
I was feeling pretty depressed
last night,

40:18.467 --> 40:19.833
'cause it's my favorite sled,

40:19.835 --> 40:22.102
and I've had a lot
of miles on it.

40:22.104 --> 40:23.369
So I got this sled,

40:23.371 --> 40:25.905
which is kind of a carbon copy
of the other one,

40:25.907 --> 40:28.741
however, it's about
two feet shorter,

40:28.743 --> 40:33.012
so it doesn't have the hauling
capacity that the other one had,

40:33.014 --> 40:36.082
and so it's gonna be
a little bit more tricky

40:36.084 --> 40:38.418
getting everything in here.

41:14.556 --> 41:16.890
Alright, that's
a nice-sized beaver.

41:16.892 --> 41:20.693
That's probably a good
30 pounds, maybe 35.

41:20.695 --> 41:22.061
We'll find out when we get home.

41:22.063 --> 41:23.463
I mean, that's a,
that's a mature beaver.

41:23.465 --> 41:25.165
That's not a little kit.

41:25.167 --> 41:27.767
Go back to the house and
skin him out, butcher him up,

boil him up, have a nice
beaver dinner tonight.

a beaver, guys.

something from the land

You know, I don't want to go
to the store and buy crap.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.848
I want to go out and get
the animals and make it.

41:41.850 --> 41:44.651

it's about being self-reliant

41:44.653 --> 41:47.654

blanket size.

super blanket,

41:57.332 --> 41:59.365

good-sized hide.
