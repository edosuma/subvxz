Mr. Spencer. Mr. Spencer,
I hate to bother you...

02:35.168 --> 02:37.762
but I thought
you'd like to know
there were two men here.

02:37.838 --> 02:39.772
Two men askin' for you.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.707
Ayoung man
and a kind of older man.

02:42.776 --> 02:45.745
They was sorry you wasn't in.
I said you wasn't.

02:45.812 --> 02:50.078
Did they say they'd be back?
They didn't say exactly,
but I think they will.

02:50.150 --> 02:54.211
Just now, when I had to go
down to the store, I seen them
standing there at the corner.

02:54.287 --> 02:56.653
Maybe I shoulda let
them in, only you said
not to disturb you-

02:56.723 --> 03:00.557
Yes?
And I'm sure they'll be back.

03:00.627 --> 03:03.596
You look kinda tired to me,
and that's a fact.

03:03.663 --> 03:05.927
You got a headache
or somethin'?

03:05.999 --> 03:09.526
I think maybe
you need a real rest.
That's what I think.

03:09.603 --> 03:13.471
Why, Mr. Spencer.
You oughtn't to leave all that
money lying around like that.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.168
Oh, it makes me nervous
to see money lying around.

03:16.243 --> 03:18.370
Everybody in the world
ain't honest, you know.

03:18.445 --> 03:21.005
Though I must say I haven't had
much trouble that way.

03:21.081 --> 03:25.677
<i>Those friends of yours</i>
<i>told me not to mention</i>
<i>they'd called.</i>

03:25.752 --> 03:29.313
Wanted to surprise you.
But I thought you'd like
to know somehow.

03:29.389 --> 03:32.153
Yes, yes. Of course.
If they come back,
you may show them in.

03:32.225 --> 03:35.717
Yes.
You know, Mrs. Martin,
it's very funny.

03:35.795 --> 03:39.162
They aren't exactly
friends of mine.
They've never seen me.

03:39.232 --> 03:42.360
That's odd, isn't it?
'Tis odd, like you say.

03:42.435 --> 03:47.304
And now that I'm here,
I'll have to meet them.

03:47.374 --> 03:51.435
I may even go out
and meet them.

03:51.511 --> 03:54.844

I may not. Not yet.

Am coming out to stay

06:49.856 --> 06:53.155

Out. The average mind-

09:39.125 --> 09:43.084
Where's Charlie?
Out. No, I mean she's upstairs
in her room thinking.

Well, don't read too much.

And I think we ought
to do something for her.

11:20.193 --> 11:23.822
<i>Don't you think we should?</i>
Yeah. What were you thinking
of doing for her?

11:23.896 --> 11:28.230
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

11:28.301 --> 11:30.667
I guess we'll just have to wait
for a miracle or something.

11:30.737 --> 11:33.797
Oh, now, Charlie, you're right.
Absolutely right.

11:33.873 --> 11:38.708
- I'll figure out some way-
- Oh, I don't believe
in good intentions anymore.

11:38.778 --> 11:42.441
All I'm waiting for now
is a miracle.
Oh, Charlie.

Oh, I've become
a nagging old maid.

11:51.891 --> 11:55.156

what hat I put on?

11:58.464 --> 12:02.230

I'm going downstairs anyway.

<i>Oh, it's nothing. Charlie's</i>
<i>a bit under the weather.</i>

<i>Let's go downstairs.</i>
<i>No use standing here.</i>

a bottle of beer.

12:21.254 --> 12:23.245
Mother, I'm going downtown

12:23.322 --> 12:25.620
Why, darling, who do you know
to send a telegram to?

12:25.691 --> 12:29.320
I know a wonderful person
who'll come and shake us up.
Just the one to save us.

12:29.395 --> 12:31.693
What do you mean, "save us"?

12:31.764 --> 12:34.824
All this time, there's been
one right person to save us.

12:34.901 --> 12:39.201
- Mother, what's
Uncle Charlie's address?
- Uncle Charlie?

12:39.272 --> 12:41.968
- Now, you're not going to ask
him for money, are you?
- Of course not.

12:42.041 --> 12:45.977
That wouldn't help us.
What's his address?
The last address I had-

12:46.045 --> 12:47.979
Do you know how many steps
I had to take...

12:48.047 --> 12:49.912
to get from here
to the drugstore and back?

12:49.982 --> 12:54.544
649.
No. If you've forgotten,
I'm not going to tell you.

12:56.422 --> 13:01.325
I remember. Philadelphia.
You can't ask a busy man to come
all this way for nothing.

13:01.394 --> 13:03.760
He'll come for me.
I'm named after him.

13:03.830 --> 13:06.060
Besides, we're
the only relatives
he has in the world.

<i>up Fourth Street, it's 802.</i>

I have no time for guessing.
What's that thing in your hair?

13:14.006 --> 13:18.272
Well, I'll tell you anyway,
even though I think it's nicer
when people guess.

13:18.344 --> 13:22.474
Mrs. Henderson said to call her
at the telegraph office because
she says we have a telegram.

13:22.548 --> 13:24.880
Ann, I don't think
you ought to put things
behind your ears.

13:24.951 --> 13:29.012
Something might get
into your ear.
Emmy, Ann
says we have a telegram.

13:29.088 --> 13:32.649
I think you ought to find out
about it. Somebody might be
sick or something.

13:32.725 --> 13:34.989
Mrs. Henderson didn't read
the telegram...
Telegram for me?

13:35.061 --> 13:37.120
Because I couldn't
find a pencil.

13:37.196 --> 13:40.256
When I have a house,
it's going to be full
of well-sharpened pencils.

13:40.333 --> 13:44.201
- Did Mrs. Henderson say
who the telegram was from?
<i>- No. She didn't.</i>

13:44.270 --> 13:47.103
[Boy Chattering]
I think she might have said
who it was from.

13:47.173 --> 13:49.767
Come on, Ann.
That's my chair.
I'll call up and find out.

13:49.842 --> 13:53.334
If you will be quiet
just a second.

13:54.881 --> 13:58.578
Hello. 181, please.
I wonder who it can be?

13:58.651 --> 14:01.711
Oh, nothing, Operator.
Just 181.

14:01.787 --> 14:04.449
If that's from my sister-
<i>Hello?</i>

14:04.524 --> 14:07.493
Mrs. Henderson?
This is Emma Newton.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.051
Ann says you have
a telegram for me.

14:10.129 --> 14:12.063
Mama, you don't
have to shout.
Shh.

14:12.131 --> 14:15.532
Really, Papa. You'd think
Mama had never seen a phone.

14:15.601 --> 14:17.660
She makes no allowance
for science.

14:17.737 --> 14:20.797
She thinks she has
to cover the distance
by sheer lung power.

14:20.873 --> 14:25.003
Why, how wonderful.
Thursday, you say?

14:25.077 --> 14:26.977
Looks like somebody's coming.

14:27.046 --> 14:30.982
- Who's coming, Ma?
- Well, it's
the most wonderful surprise.

14:31.050 --> 14:35.077
It's my brother, you know.
My younger brother. The baby.

14:35.154 --> 14:38.988
Yes, of course, a little spoiled.
You know how families
always spoil the youngest.

14:40.092 --> 14:43.186
<i>Well, it's just</i>
<i>simply wonderful.</i>

14:43.262 --> 14:46.231
Thanks most awfully,
Mrs. Henderson.

14:47.266 --> 14:49.200
Well.

14:50.469 --> 14:53.961
What do you think?
Charles is coming.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.008
Who?
Who?
Your Uncle Charlie.

14:56.075 --> 15:00.978
- Did you say "Charles"?
- And our Charlie's gone
to send him a telegram.

15:01.047 --> 15:04.346
Now, what made her think
to do that?
What do you mean our Charlie-

15:04.417 --> 15:06.612
<i>[Woman] Hello, Charlie.</i>
<i>I just called your house.</i>

15:06.686 --> 15:09.314
Telegram for your mother.
Did you?

15:09.388 --> 15:11.515
Gonna send that by Bill Forest,
but you can take it.

15:11.591 --> 15:14.458
Thanks.
From your uncle.

15:16.596 --> 15:18.723
Yeah.

15:23.035 --> 15:26.095
Mrs. Henderson,
do you believe in telepathy?

15:26.172 --> 15:28.072
Well, I ought to.
That's my business.

15:28.140 --> 15:31.439
Oh, not telegraphy.
Mental telepathy.

15:31.510 --> 15:34.445
Like... well,
suppose you have a thought,

15:34.513 --> 15:37.311
and suppose the thought's about
someone you're in tune with.

15:37.383 --> 15:41.820
Then across miles,
that person knows what you're
thinking and answers you.

15:41.887 --> 15:45.323
And it's all mental.
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:45.391 --> 15:47.723
I only send telegrams
the normal way.

15:56.702 --> 15:58.897
He heard me. He heard me.

You're almost in Santa Rosa.
Want to be ready
when you get into Santa Rosa.

16:18.157 --> 16:22.059
<i>I'm ready now. Thanks.</i>
Then I'll get all your bags
out for you, then.

16:22.128 --> 16:24.688
How you feelin', Mr. Otis?
<i>Pretty well.</i>

16:24.764 --> 16:27.392
<i>A little weak but pretty well</i>
<i>on the whole.</i>

16:27.466 --> 16:29.434
Mm-hmm.

16:29.502 --> 16:31.561
Harry, tell the porter
you're a doctor.

16:31.637 --> 16:34.902
Ask if there's anything
you can do. Maybe you can
help that poor soul.

16:34.974 --> 16:38.637
I'm on my vacation.
Porter, my husband's a doctor
and if there's anything-

16:38.711 --> 16:42.169
No, Ma'am.
He's a very sick man.
Won't see anyone.

16:42.248 --> 16:45.308
I haven't set eyes on him
myself since we first got
on the train.

16:45.384 --> 16:48.114
<i>[Doctor] Well, you don't look</i>
<i>very well either.</i>

Ah, here we are.
Come on, children.

17:00.933 --> 17:03.731
Close the door, there.
That's right.

17:03.803 --> 17:05.896
[Steam Hissing]

17:09.008 --> 17:14.412
[Train Bell Ringing]

18:04.530 --> 18:07.294
Oh, are you-
Charlie.

18:07.366 --> 18:10.267
Young Charlie.
At first, I didn't know you.
I thought you were sick.

18:10.336 --> 18:14.397
Sick?
You aren't sick, are you?
Look, Pop! Here he is!

18:14.473 --> 18:17.840
Why, Uncle Charlie,
you're not sick.
That was the funniest thing.

18:17.910 --> 18:22.904
Sick? Me, sick?
Well, Joe, how are you?
All right, Charles.

18:22.982 --> 18:26.145
Roger. Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't remember me.

18:26.218 --> 18:29.676
I remember you sort of.
You look different.
[Laughs]

18:29.755 --> 18:32.553
<i>Well, we better get started.</i>
<i>Emma's got the dinner</i>
<i>almost ready.</i>

18:32.625 --> 18:35.890
I couldn't persuade her
to come to the station.
Dinner came first.

18:35.961 --> 18:38.896
Roger, get the bags.
Charles, I'll take that.
Thank you, Joe.

18:38.964 --> 18:41.558
That's it. Come on. Let's go.

19:05.157 --> 19:08.854
<i>[Charlie]</i>
<i>Come on there, Roger,</i>
<i>and get these bags.</i>

19:08.928 --> 19:11.192
[Groans]
You, uh, sure
that isn't too heavy for you?

19:11.263 --> 19:14.426
Oh, no. It's nothing.
I love to carry.

19:18.003 --> 19:19.937
Emma. Don't move.

19:20.005 --> 19:22.269
Standing there, you don't look
like Emma Newton.

19:22.341 --> 19:26.243
You look like Emma Spencer
Oakley of 46 Burnham Street,
St. Paul, Minnesota.

19:26.312 --> 19:29.042
'T he prettiest girl
on the block.'
Charles!

19:29.114 --> 19:32.641
Charlie.
Mama, nobody got off the train
but Uncle Charlie.

19:32.718 --> 19:35.186
Let me look at you.
We were the only ones
who met somebody.

19:35.254 --> 19:38.621
To think you could
take the time off.
There was only one bed made up.

19:38.691 --> 19:42.320
Oh, Charles, it's so wonderful
to have you here.
Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.

19:42.394 --> 19:44.862
And imagine your thinking
of 46 Burnham Street.

19:44.930 --> 19:47.330
I haven't thought of that
funny old street in years.

19:47.399 --> 19:52.063
- I keep remembering those
things. All the old things.
<i>- [Joe] Emmy, how's he look?</i>

19:52.137 --> 19:54.128
Same old Charles, eh?

19:54.206 --> 19:56.936
Roger, Ann,
get these other bags.

20:01.247 --> 20:04.648
<i>[Joe] You have</i>
<i>Charlie's room right here</i>
<i>at the head of the stairs.</i>

20:04.717 --> 20:09.177
Emmy wanted to move Ann,
but Charlie thought you'd be
more comfortable here.

20:09.255 --> 20:11.348
<i>[Ann] Come on, Roger.</i>

20:11.423 --> 20:14.859
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Don't put the hat on the bed.
Superstitious, Joe?

20:14.927 --> 20:17.828
No, but I don't believe
in inviting trouble.

21:02.675 --> 21:06.111
It wasn't the biggest yacht
in the world, but it had
a fireplace in the library...

21:06.178 --> 21:09.204
and the bar was panelled
in bleached mahogany.

21:09.281 --> 21:13.911
You pushed a button and-
What am I talking about?
That's all over.

21:13.986 --> 21:15.920
<i>Let's talk about you.</i>

21:15.988 --> 21:19.480
Charlie, that's
the prettiest dress I ever saw.

21:19.558 --> 21:21.617
I think so too.
<i>[Emmy Giggles]</i>

21:21.694 --> 21:24.162
Why, Charles,
don't you remember?

21:24.229 --> 21:26.163
Remember? Remember what?

21:26.231 --> 21:28.859
Why, Uncle Charlie,
you sent it to me.
I did?

21:28.934 --> 21:32.062
Well, say, I've been
sitting here all this time
forgetting something.

21:32.137 --> 21:35.106
Ann. Roger.
[Family Gasping]

21:35.174 --> 21:39.338
Look at that. Oh, dear now.
Joe. Don't know whether
you had one or not.

21:39.411 --> 21:43.347
You didn't have to think
of me, Charles. Presents
for the children are all right.

21:43.415 --> 21:46.316
Say... I've never had
a wristwatch.

21:46.385 --> 21:49.183
Fellows at the bank'll think
I'm quite a sport.

21:51.690 --> 21:53.749
<i>I have two for you, Emmy.</i>
<i>One old and one new.</i>

21:53.826 --> 21:56.294
<i>[Emmy] Oh, Charles.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>

21:56.362 --> 21:59.525
You shouldn't have.
Really. No.
Well, yeah.

22:01.233 --> 22:04.430
[Gasps]
Oh, Charles.

22:04.503 --> 22:07.870
<i>[Box Lid Clunks]</i>
Oh, how... beautiful.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.965
Oh, I've-I've
always wanted one.

22:10.042 --> 22:13.136
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right.
It's what you should have.

22:13.212 --> 22:15.146
Look, Emmy.

22:20.285 --> 22:23.618
Charles. You've had these
all along.

22:23.689 --> 22:26.783
<i>Mm-hmm. All along, Emmy.</i>
<i>All these years.</i>

22:26.859 --> 22:29.521
Safe in a deposit box.
No matter where I was.

22:29.595 --> 22:31.722
Oh. Grandpa and Grandma?

22:31.797 --> 22:34.129
1888.
[Whistles]

22:34.199 --> 22:36.360
<i>53 years ago.</i>

22:36.435 --> 22:39.029
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.

22:39.104 --> 22:42.665
Everybody was sweet
and pretty then, Charlie.
The whole world.

22:42.741 --> 22:46.404
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.

22:47.479 --> 22:49.811
Not like the world now.

22:49.882 --> 22:51.816
It was great to be young then.

22:51.884 --> 22:55.047
We're all happy now,
Uncle Charlie. Look at us.

22:55.120 --> 22:59.181
For once, we're all happy
at the same time.
Now, for your present, Charlie.

22:59.258 --> 23:03.752
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.

23:03.829 --> 23:05.820
Before you came,
I didn't think I had anything,

23:05.898 --> 23:09.925
but now I don't want
another thing.

23:10.002 --> 23:12.903
She's crazy.
She doesn't mean it. Really.

23:12.971 --> 23:16.498
If you ask me,
I think she's putting on,
like girls in books.

23:16.575 --> 23:19.635
The ones that say
they don't want anything
always get more in the end.

23:19.712 --> 23:22.909
That's what she's hoping.
She's not crazy.

23:22.981 --> 23:25.006
The smartest girl
in her class at school.

23:25.084 --> 23:28.850
<i>Won the debate</i>
<i>against the East Richmond</i>
<i>High School single-handed.</i>

23:28.921 --> 23:31.014
<i>She's got brains.</i>

23:34.593 --> 23:37.892
I meant it. Please don't
give me anything.

23:37.963 --> 23:40.557
- Nothing?
- Oh, I can't explain it.

23:40.632 --> 23:45.660
But you came here
and Mother's so happy and-

23:45.738 --> 23:50.072
Oh, I'm glad that she named me
after you and that she thinks
we're both alike.

23:50.142 --> 23:53.873
I think we are too. I know it.

23:53.946 --> 23:57.473
Oh, it would spoil things
if you should give me anything.

23:57.549 --> 24:01.679
You're a strange girl, Charlie.
Why would it spoil things?

24:01.754 --> 24:06.691
Because we're not just
an uncle and a niece.
It's something else.

24:06.759 --> 24:11.321
I know you.
I know that you don't
tell people a lot of things.

24:11.396 --> 24:17.266
I don't either.
I have a feeling that
inside you somewhere,

24:17.336 --> 24:20.499
<i>there's something</i>
<i>nobody knows about.</i>

24:20.572 --> 24:23.006
Something... nobody knows?

24:23.075 --> 24:28.707
- Something secret and wonderful
and... I'll find it out.
- [Chuckles]

24:28.781 --> 24:30.749
It's not good to find out
too much, Charlie.

24:30.816 --> 24:33.614
But we're sort of like twins.
Don't you see?

24:33.685 --> 24:37.951
- We have to know.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

24:49.868 --> 24:52.393
Thank you.

24:52.471 --> 24:56.339
You didn't even look at it.
I don't have to look at it.

24:56.408 --> 24:58.501
No matter what you gave me,
it'd be the same.

24:58.577 --> 25:00.511
Here. Let me show you.

25:02.781 --> 25:06.512
It's a good emerald.
A really good one.

25:09.488 --> 25:13.584
Good emeralds are
the most beautiful things
in the world.

25:20.432 --> 25:23.833
You've had something engraved.
I haven't,
but I will if you like it.

25:23.902 --> 25:26.462
Yes, you have, Uncle Charlie.
It's very faint.

25:26.538 --> 25:30.304
"T.S. From B.M."

25:30.375 --> 25:33.640
But-Why, it must be
someone's initials.

25:35.981 --> 25:38.541
Well, I've been rooked.
The jeweler rooked me.

25:38.617 --> 25:40.983
Oh, it doesn't matter. Really.
Give it back.
I'll have it taken off.

25:41.053 --> 25:43.453
No, No. I like it this way.

25:43.522 --> 25:46.650
Someone else was probably happy
with this ring.

25:46.725 --> 25:49.592
Oh, it's perfect the way it is.

25:49.661 --> 25:51.891
You bring the coffee.

26:03.041 --> 26:03.939
[Charlie Humming]

26:11.350 --> 26:13.648
Sing at the table, you'll marry
a crazy husband.

26:13.719 --> 26:16.745
Superstitions have been
proved 100% wrong.

26:16.822 --> 26:20.314
Yes, I've been thinking
of transferring some money
out here from the East.

26:20.392 --> 26:22.553
I could put it
in your bank, Joe,
until I found out what's what.

26:22.628 --> 26:27.031
Uh, I suppose your bank
does take money, huh?
[Chuckles]

26:27.099 --> 26:29.294
That's one thing we do.
Rake in the dough.

26:29.368 --> 26:31.302
Can't promise to give it back.

26:31.370 --> 26:33.361
Well, I think I'll go
downtown in the morning
and open an account.

26:33.438 --> 26:38.102
- Say, 30 or $40,000
just to start things off?
- That's a lot of money.

26:38.176 --> 26:40.770
He won't have it long.
The government will get it.

26:40.846 --> 26:44.077
The government gets-
You're not to talk
against the government, Roger.

26:44.149 --> 26:48.552
[Humming]
<i>[Emmy] My goodness.</i>
<i>The way men do things.</i>

26:48.620 --> 26:51.282
I can't get that tune
out of my head.

26:51.356 --> 26:54.052
Maybe if somebody tells me
what it is, I'll forget it.

26:54.126 --> 26:57.061
<i>[Emmy] It's a waltz.</i>
I know it is, but what one?

26:57.129 --> 26:59.097
<i>[Charlie] You know, it's</i>
<i>the funniest thing.</i>

26:59.164 --> 27:01.496
<i>Sometimes I get a tune</i>
<i>in my head like that...</i>

27:01.566 --> 27:04.535
and pretty soon, I hear
somebody else humming it too.

27:04.603 --> 27:06.935
I think tunes jump
from head to head.

27:07.005 --> 27:10.065
<i>Do you know what it is,</i>
<i>Uncle Charlie?</i>

27:10.142 --> 27:12.940
Uh, no. No. L-l-I don't know
what it is.

27:13.011 --> 27:17.744
<i>[Emmy] I remember. Uh-</i>
<i>It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

27:17.816 --> 27:20.011
<i>It's a waltz</i>
<i>and it's Victor Herbert.</i>

27:20.085 --> 27:24.681
- Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz.
He was-
- It's the <i>Blue Danube</i> waltz.

27:24.756 --> 27:27.725
Oh, yes. Of course it is.

27:29.895 --> 27:33.353
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie.
I know what it is.
It's the <i>Merry-</i>

27:33.432 --> 27:36.868
I'm terribly sorry, Emmy.
Nothing to make a fuss over.

27:36.935 --> 27:40.200
Charles, while we do
the dishes, why don't you come
in the living room...

27:40.272 --> 27:42.740
and stretch out
on the sofa and read
the evening paper?

27:42.808 --> 27:44.742
You never were much on helping.

27:44.810 --> 27:48.507
Joe, here's Herbert.
<i>[Charlie] Ann, Roger.</i>
<i>Help me clear the table.</i>

27:48.580 --> 27:51.777
Herbert's a friend ofJoe's.
They're literary critics.

27:53.352 --> 27:55.582
Hello, Herb. Had your supper?

27:55.654 --> 27:59.090
Had mine an hour ago.
Hour ago, huh?

27:59.157 --> 28:01.091
Oh. A watch.
Yeah. A present.

28:01.159 --> 28:04.788
Here, Herb.
I'd like you to meet
my brother-in-law.

28:04.863 --> 28:08.321
Charles, this is Herb Hawkins.
Nice to know you, Mr. Hawkins.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.732
Fine, thank you.
How's your mother, Herb?

28:10.802 --> 28:14.499
Oh, uh, just middling.
Uh-huh.

28:14.573 --> 28:16.507
Excuse me, Herb.

28:16.575 --> 28:19.806
Oh.
Thank you. I'm sorry
your mother's not better.

28:19.878 --> 28:23.006
Thank you, dear. There, now.
Thank you.

28:23.081 --> 28:26.642
<i>[Emmy] Lead a life ofluxury.</i>

28:26.718 --> 28:30.154
<i>Well, I must go and see</i>
<i>what Charlie's doing.</i>

28:34.459 --> 28:38.225
Wife's brother from the East.
New York man.

28:38.296 --> 28:41.595
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?

28:41.666 --> 28:46.262
In business?
Well, he takes himself
very seriously.

28:46.338 --> 28:48.602
Well, how's everything?

28:48.673 --> 28:51.836
Say, ha-have you read
this one?
Huh?

28:51.910 --> 28:53.844
That little Frenchman
beats them all.

28:53.912 --> 28:56.745
You can talk all you like
about Sherlock Holmes.

28:56.815 --> 28:58.749
That little Frenchman
beats 'em all.

28:58.817 --> 29:02.218
I read it. Air bubbles don't
necessarily kill a person.

29:02.287 --> 29:05.222
Those writers
from the other side
get too fancy.

29:05.290 --> 29:08.589
The best way
to commit a murder-
I know. I know.

29:08.660 --> 29:10.855
Hit 'em on the head
with a blunt instrument.

29:10.929 --> 29:13.454
Well, it's true,
isn't it? Listen.

29:13.532 --> 29:15.591
If I wanted
to murder you tomorrow,

29:15.667 --> 29:18.693
do you think I'd waste my time
on fancy hypodermics?

29:18.770 --> 29:20.738
Or on Inee?
What's that?

29:20.806 --> 29:23.639
Inee- Indian arrow poison.
Oh.

29:23.708 --> 29:28.077
Listen. I'd find out
if you were alone, walk in,

29:28.146 --> 29:31.377
hit you on the head
with a piece of lead pipe
or a loaded cane-

29:31.450 --> 29:33.441
What'd be the fun of that?

29:33.518 --> 29:36.180
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?

29:36.254 --> 29:38.882
I don't want any clues.
I want to murder you.

29:38.957 --> 29:41.255
What do I want with clues?

29:41.326 --> 29:44.386
Well, if you
haven't got any clues,
where's your book?

29:44.463 --> 29:49.093
I'm not talkin'
'bout writing books.
I'm talking about killing you!

29:49.167 --> 29:53.194
If I was going to kill you,
I wouldn't do a dumb thing
like hitting you on the head.

29:53.271 --> 29:56.832
First of all, I don't like
the fingerprint angle.

29:56.908 --> 30:00.207
Of course, I could always
wear gloves, press your
hands against the pipe...

30:00.278 --> 30:04.339
after you were dead and
make you look like a suicide.
Ho, ho!

30:04.416 --> 30:09.376
Except it don't seem
hardly likely that you'd beat
yourself to death with a club.

30:09.454 --> 30:11.388
I'd murder you
so it didn't look like murder.

30:34.913 --> 30:38.349
- Oh, Ann?
- What?

30:38.416 --> 30:40.941
<i>Come here.</i>

30:41.019 --> 30:44.250
Did you ever see a house
made out of newspapers?

30:44.322 --> 30:46.654
Well, watch.

30:46.725 --> 30:50.593
You-You take one sheet here.

30:50.662 --> 30:53.859
Okay?
And you tear it down here.

30:53.932 --> 30:56.594
And you tear it there.

30:56.668 --> 31:00.627
And you fold it
over here at the side.

31:00.705 --> 31:02.730
<i>Fold over the other side here.</i>

31:02.807 --> 31:05.139
And turn it up there.

31:05.210 --> 31:07.804
Now with... the door-

31:07.879 --> 31:10.677
Right off... and there.

31:10.749 --> 31:14.742
I'm not a baby
anymore. Besides,
that's Papa's paper.

31:14.819 --> 31:18.846
<i>[Uncle Charlie]</i>
<i>Oh, Roger, look what we've got.</i>
<i>A nice, little red barn.</i>

31:18.924 --> 31:22.826
- You've got Papa's paper.
- Oh, that's all right.
Simply unfold it.

31:22.894 --> 31:27.991
<i>Nobody will ever know</i>
<i>the difference.</i>
What are you two doing?

31:28.066 --> 31:31.832
<i>You know that's father's paper.</i>
Oh, it's my fault, Charlie.
I was showing them a game.

31:31.903 --> 31:35.430
<i>Didn't think about it</i>
<i>being Joe's paper.</i>
Oh, that's all right.

31:35.507 --> 31:40.376
Here's page one, five... eight.

31:40.445 --> 31:43.209
What'd you do
with page three and four?
We never touched it.

31:43.281 --> 31:46.341
<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>Really. Uncle Charlie's</i>
<i>the only one that touched it.</i>

31:46.418 --> 31:48.010
Oh, well.
I guess it's all right.

31:48.086 --> 31:50.748
<i>If I fold it very neatly,</i>
<i>maybe he won't notice.</i>

31:58.730 --> 32:00.891
<i>[Uncle Charlie] Come in.</i>

32:00.966 --> 32:06.131
I brought you water.
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful of you.

32:06.204 --> 32:09.037
<i>Pleasant dreams.</i>

32:12.177 --> 32:17.877
- Uncle Charlie, I know a secret
you don't think I know.
- What secret?

32:17.949 --> 32:23.012
Remember I said you couldn't
hide anything from me
because I'd find it out?

32:23.088 --> 32:26.148
Well, now I know there was
something in the evening paper
about you.

32:26.224 --> 32:29.250
About me in the evening paper?
<i>About you.</i>

32:29.327 --> 32:31.795
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>you played that game</i>
<i>with Ann and Roger.</i>

32:31.863 --> 32:34.991
You didn't want us to know
and you wanted
to tear the paper.

32:35.066 --> 32:38.126
- Now I know.
You might as well tell me.
- [Chuckling]

32:38.203 --> 32:40.535
Well, you've got me
there, Charlie.

32:40.605 --> 32:42.505
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about, uh...

32:42.574 --> 32:45.168
<i>someone I used to know.</i>

32:46.478 --> 32:48.742
There!

32:50.415 --> 32:51.848
It's none of your business.

32:53.385 --> 32:55.353
[Gasping]
Oh! Uncle Charlie,
you're hurting me.

32:55.420 --> 32:57.888
Oh, Charlie.
Your hands.

32:57.956 --> 33:01.392
Charlie, I didn't mean
to hurt you.
[Short Chuckle]

33:01.459 --> 33:04.587
I was just fooling.
[Chuckling]

33:04.663 --> 33:08.497
It was nothing.
Just-Just some gossip.

33:08.566 --> 33:12.764
Not very pretty about someone
I once met up with.

33:12.837 --> 33:15.328
[Chuckles]

33:15.407 --> 33:17.341
Not for you to read.

33:19.911 --> 33:22.402
Forget it.

33:22.480 --> 33:27.679
Good night, young Charlie.
Good night, Uncle Charlie.
Pleasant dreams.

33:37.362 --> 33:41.492
<i>[Church Bell Tolling]</i>

33:43.034 --> 33:46.936
How long is Uncle Charlie
going to stay here?
Forever, I hope.

33:47.005 --> 33:48.939
Hasn't he got
a house of his own?

33:49.007 --> 33:51.407
Not that I mind you in here,
but I never can tell...

33:51.476 --> 33:53.910
when I'll want some privacy.

33:53.978 --> 33:56.572
[Chuckles]
You better go to sleep, baby.

33:56.648 --> 33:58.673
You said your prayers?
I forgot.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.843
You better say them.

34:02.287 --> 34:04.755
I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep-

34:04.823 --> 34:07.815
Don't bless too many people.
It's late.
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

34:07.892 --> 34:11.851
God bless Mama, Papa,
Captain Midnight, Veronica Lake
and the president-

34:11.929 --> 34:17.061
You can't say them
all tonight, dear.
Oh, and Uncle Charlie. Amen.

34:20.237 --> 34:22.263
[Sighs]

34:25.275 --> 34:30.235
[Humming Waltz]

34:39.556 --> 34:41.991
<i>[Distant Train Whistle]</i>

34:43.128 --> 34:45.527
<i>[Traffic Noises]</i>

34:49.434 --> 34:53.130
All ready for breakfast?
Oh, coffee. Emmy.

34:53.204 --> 34:56.731
I don't know how you do it.
Now, I'm never comfortable
eating in bed.

34:56.808 --> 34:59.072
I had to have my meals
in bed for awhile...

34:59.144 --> 35:02.045
after the children came,
but I never liked it.

35:02.113 --> 35:05.446
I can't face the world
in the morning. I must have
coffee before I can speak.

35:05.517 --> 35:08.179
Well, I don't mind
pampering you
your first morning,

35:08.253 --> 35:12.212
but I think you're
the only person in this town
to have breakfast at 10:30.

35:12.290 --> 35:15.987
And while you were sleeping,
the newspaper called up
for an interview.

35:16.060 --> 35:20.690
With me?
And the women's club I belong to
wants you to give a little talk.

35:20.765 --> 35:23.734
- [Chuckling]
Women's club.
- [Laughing]

35:23.802 --> 35:28.205
Oh! Oh, you haven't
finished unpacking.
I'll do that for you.

35:28.273 --> 35:31.242
<i>Where's Charlie?</i>
She's running around the house
as though she'd lost her mind.

35:31.309 --> 35:33.243
She thinks everything
needs fixing.

35:33.311 --> 35:38.248
But what I wanted to tell you
was that you are not
the only celebrity in this town.

35:38.316 --> 35:41.615
<i>The whole Newton family's</i>
<i>going to be in the limelight.</i>
What are you cooking up?

35:41.686 --> 35:45.053
<i>Well, a young man called</i>
<i>this morning,</i>
<i>said his name was Graham...</i>

35:45.123 --> 35:48.251
<i>and he wants to interview</i>
<i>everybody in this house.</i>

35:48.326 --> 35:50.487
Interview everybody?
<i>That's what he said.</i>

35:50.562 --> 35:55.499
He's being sent
around the country by some kind
of institute or committee...

35:55.567 --> 35:59.401
and he has to pick
representative American families
and ask them questions.

35:59.471 --> 36:03.874
<i>It's a kind of a poll.</i>
<i>It's called</i>
<i>the National Public Survey.</i>

36:03.942 --> 36:05.933
Wonder how he happened
to pick this family?

36:06.010 --> 36:08.638
Well, he said he wanted
a typical American family.

36:08.713 --> 36:11.375
I told him we weren't
a typical American family.

36:11.449 --> 36:14.043
Well, if he's going to ask
a lot of questions,
he can leave me out of it.

36:14.118 --> 36:17.884
Oh, but you could tell him
so much more
than any of us could.

36:17.956 --> 36:21.448
- He's going to take
our pictures too.
- Pictures.

36:21.526 --> 36:23.585
[Gasps]
My. Isn't that lovely?

36:23.661 --> 36:29.463
You see, there were really,
there were two young men.
One of them takes the pictures.

36:29.534 --> 36:32.867
Oh, there were two.
<i>Yes. Mr. Graham</i>
<i>was the nicest.</i>

36:32.937 --> 36:35.337
Oh, he doesn't want us
to dress up or anything.

36:35.406 --> 36:39.001
<i>Hejust wants us to act</i>
<i>the way we always do.</i>
Emmy, women are fools.

36:39.077 --> 36:41.443
<i>They'd fall for anything.</i>

36:44.682 --> 36:47.651
Why do you let
two strangers come and turn
the place upside-down?

36:47.719 --> 36:51.587
<i>Why expose the family</i>
<i>to a couple of snoopers?</i>

36:51.656 --> 36:55.956
- [Short Chuckle]
You ought to have better sense.
- Why, Charles, l-

36:56.027 --> 36:58.825
<i>- [Charlie]</i>
<i>Good morning, Uncle Charlie.</i>
- Good morning, Charlie.

36:58.897 --> 37:02.424
Your mother's been telling me
about the Newtons being picked
for all-American suckers.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.593
What do you know about it?
Charlie wasn't here
when they came.

37:04.669 --> 37:06.728
But really, Charles,
the way Mr. Graham told it...

37:06.804 --> 37:08.738
it wasn't like snooping at all.

37:08.806 --> 37:12.503
It was our duty as citizens.
It's something
the government wants.

37:12.577 --> 37:15.478
Government?
<i>Maybe not exactly,</i>
<i>but it's for the public good.</i>

37:15.547 --> 37:19.415
<i>When I told them about you</i>
<i>and the places you've been,</i>
<i>he was really interested.</i>

37:19.484 --> 37:21.418
Now, listen, Emmy.
I'll have nothing
to do with this.

37:21.486 --> 37:24.387
I'm just a visitor here
and my advice to you is
to slam the door in his face.

37:24.455 --> 37:26.753
Oh. Well, l-I couldn't do that.

37:26.824 --> 37:28.917
But you don't have to meet him
if you don't want to.

37:28.993 --> 37:30.927
Well, I think I'd be
kind of exciting.

37:30.995 --> 37:33.463
He'd take your photograph
and then we could have it
for nothing.

37:33.531 --> 37:36.295
No thank you. I've never
been photographed in my life
and I don't want to be.

37:36.367 --> 37:38.301
Oh, Charles, how can you
talk that way?

37:38.369 --> 37:41.270
I had a photograph of you.
I gave it to Charlie.

37:41.339 --> 37:45.002
I tell you, there are none.
I guess you've
forgotten this one.

37:45.076 --> 37:47.567
Get it, Charlie.

37:47.645 --> 37:49.545
<i>[Emmy] You sure</i>
<i>you don't remember?</i>

37:49.614 --> 37:52.913
<i>[Uncle Charlie]</i>
<i>Of course I don't ever remember</i>
<i>being photographed.</i>

37:56.821 --> 37:58.914
46 Burnham Street.

37:58.990 --> 38:02.289
Mm-hmm. It was taken
the Christmas
you got your bicycle.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.852
Just before your accident.
Uncle Charlie,
you were beautiful.

38:05.930 --> 38:09.957
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy.
Always reading.

38:10.034 --> 38:14.300
Papa never should have bought
you that bicycle. You didn't
know how to handle it.

38:14.372 --> 38:19.036
He took it right out on
the icy road and skidded
into a streetcar.

38:19.110 --> 38:22.238
We thought he was going to die.
I'm glad he didn't.

38:22.313 --> 38:26.750
Well, he almost did.
He fractured his skull,
and he was laid up so long.

38:26.818 --> 38:30.015
And then,
when he was getting well,
there was no holding him.

38:30.088 --> 38:33.387
And it was just as though
all the rest he had was,
well, too much for him...

38:33.458 --> 38:36.427
and he had to get into mischief
to blow off steam.

38:36.494 --> 38:39.486
He didn't do
much reading after that,
let me tell you.

38:39.564 --> 38:42.260
It was taken the very day
he had his accident.

38:42.333 --> 38:46.827
A few days later when
the pictures came home,
how Mama cried.

38:46.904 --> 38:51.398
She wondered if he'd ever
look the same. She wondered
if he'd ever be the same.

38:51.476 --> 38:54.877
What's the use of looking
backward? What's the use
of looking ahead?

38:54.946 --> 38:59.280
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy. Today.

38:59.350 --> 39:02.217
If today's the thing,
then you'd better
finish your breakfast...

39:02.286 --> 39:04.345
and get down to the bank
becauseJoe'll be waiting.

39:04.422 --> 39:08.950
<i>And Charlie, don't be late back</i>
<i>because the questionnaire men</i>
<i>are coming at 4:00.</i>

39:20.204 --> 39:22.172
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Madge.

Good morning, Charlie.
<i>Hello, Catherine.</i>

39:33.718 --> 39:36.710
Did you see the way
they looked at you?
I bet they wonder who you are.

39:36.788 --> 39:40.884
Oh, Uncle Charlie,
I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.

39:59.977 --> 40:03.378
<i>[Keyboards Clacking]</i>
There's Papa in that
window over there.

40:03.448 --> 40:06.246
[Background Chattering]

40:09.620 --> 40:12.953
Hello, Joe. Can you stop
embezzling a minute
and give me your attention?

40:13.024 --> 40:15.549
Oh, uh...

40:15.626 --> 40:18.754
Charles, we don't joke
about such things here.

40:18.830 --> 40:21.355
Oh, what's a little shortage
in the books at the end
of the month?

40:21.432 --> 40:24.196
<i>Any good bank clerk can</i>
<i>cover up a little shortage.</i>
<i>Isn't that right, Charlie?</i>

40:24.268 --> 40:29.262
- Everyone can hear you.
- Good thing they can.
We all know what banks are.

40:29.340 --> 40:33.106
<i>Look all right,</i>
<i>but no one knows what goes on</i>
<i>when the doors are locked.</i>

40:33.177 --> 40:35.941
<i>Can't fool me, though.</i>
<i>Well, Joe, let's see</i>
<i>your president.</i>

40:36.013 --> 40:38.311
Still want to open
that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.

40:38.382 --> 40:42.785
Well, uh, you wait right here.
I'll see if Mr. Greene's busy.

40:42.854 --> 40:47.154
And, uh, Charles,
he doesn't care much
for jokes about banks.

40:47.225 --> 40:49.989
Well, $40,000 is no joke.
Not to him, I bet.

40:50.061 --> 40:53.724
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's a joke to me.

40:53.798 --> 40:56.164
I'll be right back.

41:03.007 --> 41:06.033
You shouldn't tease
Papa like that.
[Chuckles]

41:06.110 --> 41:10.240
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate
this stuffy atmosphere.

41:12.049 --> 41:14.916
They're waving
for us to come in.

41:18.556 --> 41:20.547
- [Charlie]
Hello, Mr. Greene.
- Hello, Charlie.

41:20.625 --> 41:23.890
Well, Mr. Greene, this is
my brother-in-law, Mr. Oakley.

41:23.961 --> 41:25.895
How do you do?
How are you, Mr. Oakley?

41:25.963 --> 41:28.329
Well, Mr. Greene, I was thinking
of settling down here
for awhile.

41:28.399 --> 41:32.631
Great country. Great country.
We think so.
What have you been doing?

41:32.703 --> 41:35.501
I suppose you might call me
a promoter. I've done
a little bit of everything.

41:35.573 --> 41:39.304
The only trouble I find is
that once I make the money,
I'm not interested in it.

41:39.377 --> 41:41.345
Not interested in money?
[Chuckles]

41:41.412 --> 41:44.870
You know there's plenty
of money lying around waiting
for somebody to pick it up.

41:44.949 --> 41:48.112
I thought maybe I'd put
some of my loose cash away
for safekeeping.

41:48.186 --> 41:51.781
- Naturally, I thought
of the bank whereJoe works.
<i>- [Mr. Greene] Loose cash?</i>

41:51.856 --> 41:55.724
Well, I got in a habit
of carrying a lot of cash
with me when I was traveling.

41:55.793 --> 41:59.923
A dangerous habit, Mr. Oakley.
Hmm. Never lost a penny
in my life, Mr. Greene.

41:59.997 --> 42:02.522
I guess heaven takes care
of fools and scoundrels.

42:02.600 --> 42:06.400
[Chuckles]
Yes.
Thirty, thirty-five, forty.

42:06.470 --> 42:09.439
Forty thousand. Shall we start
with forty?

42:09.507 --> 42:13.568
- If you'll just write out
a deposit slip, Mr. Oakley.
<i>- Ah, details.</i>

42:13.644 --> 42:17.341
I'm glad to see you're a man
who understands details,
Mr. Greene.

42:17.415 --> 42:19.349
They're most important to me.

42:19.417 --> 42:23.148
Most important.
All the little details.

42:23.221 --> 42:25.849
<i>[Woman] Oh, dear. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't know you were busy.</i>

42:25.923 --> 42:30.724
We can come back.
<i>Come in, now that</i>
<i>you're here. Come in.</i>

42:30.795 --> 42:34.094
Mrs. Greene,
I'd like you to meet
my uncle, Mr. Oakley.

42:34.165 --> 42:36.929
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mrs. Greene
and Mrs. Potter.

42:37.001 --> 42:39.367
Mrs. Greene, Miss Potter.

42:39.437 --> 42:41.530
[Chuckles]
Mrs. Potter.

42:41.606 --> 42:45.235
Oh, and there was something
about you that made me think-
Yes?

42:45.309 --> 42:49.712
- What did you want, Margaret?
- Well, we were going shopping
and I only had five dollars-

42:49.780 --> 42:51.714
There's one good thing
in being a widow, isn't there?

42:51.782 --> 42:55.513
You don't have to ask
your husband for money.
[All Laughing]

42:55.586 --> 42:58.054
<i>Here you are.</i>
Oh, thank you.

42:58.122 --> 43:00.283
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.
Mrs. Potter.

43:00.358 --> 43:02.223
Bye, Mrs. Greene.

43:03.661 --> 43:06.721
[Pen Scratching]
There. There you are,
Mr. Greene.

43:06.797 --> 43:09.425
Charlie, let's see the town
and have some lunch.
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.525
Bye, Mr. Greene.
Call on us for advice anytime.

43:11.602 --> 43:14.469
Thank you.
Joe, you may see
Mr. Oakley to the door.

43:14.538 --> 43:19.532
Joe, keep your eyes open.
You'll have his job
in a couple of years.

43:19.610 --> 43:22.170
<i>[Typewriters Clacking]</i>

43:29.921 --> 43:31.821
Here he is.

43:34.659 --> 43:36.627
<i>[Bus Bells Ringing]</i>

43:45.736 --> 43:48.899
Those must be
the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.

43:48.973 --> 43:51.601
I won't see them.
Don't worry.

43:51.676 --> 43:54.440
You don't have to
if you don't want to.
I'll see that you don't.

43:54.512 --> 43:56.480
The way they got
around your mother.

43:56.547 --> 43:59.107
I thought she'd have
better sense.

44:03.754 --> 44:05.722
<i>How do you do?</i>
How do you do?

44:05.790 --> 44:08.623
You must be the men
who want to interview us.
My name is Graham, Miss Newton.

44:08.693 --> 44:10.923
Oh, how do you do?
And this is Fred Saunders.

44:10.995 --> 44:13.259
How do you do?
Won't you come in?

44:13.331 --> 44:15.765
I'll call my mother.
Thank you.

44:15.833 --> 44:18.893
<i>Mother, the government men</i>
<i>are here.</i>

44:18.970 --> 44:20.870
<i>Will you sit down?</i>

44:20.938 --> 44:23.304
But you said 4:00.
Nothing's ready now.

44:23.374 --> 44:25.638
My husband is still at the bank
and-and the house is-

44:25.710 --> 44:28.201
That's all we want now,
Mrs. Newton.
Some pictures of the house.

44:28.279 --> 44:31.248
Saunders can get busy
and I'd like to ask
a few questions.

44:31.315 --> 44:36.014
All right, but I do wish
you'd waited until I had
the house looking its best.

44:36.087 --> 44:39.215
<i>I wanted flowers around</i>
<i>and fresh curtains</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

44:39.290 --> 44:42.191
<i>And there are a lot of things</i>
<i>I don't want you to photograph.</i>

44:43.961 --> 44:46.657
I believe you told me
you owned the house?
<i>Own it? It owns us.</i>

44:46.731 --> 44:50.462
It seems to me no sooner
do I get one thing fixed
then something else gets broken.

44:50.534 --> 44:52.798
And then it needs
fresh paint and th-

44:52.870 --> 44:54.804
<i>Mr. Saunders, I'm very sorry...</i>

44:54.872 --> 44:57.033
<i>but you simply cannot</i>
<i>take a picture</i>
<i>with that chair in it.</i>

44:57.108 --> 45:00.839
<i>- It needs a new slipcover.</i>
- And there are, uh,
six in your family?

45:00.911 --> 45:03.471
- Five.
- Five? But-

45:03.547 --> 45:05.515
<i>Well, my uncle's just visiting.</i>

45:05.583 --> 45:07.551
<i>[Emmy] I told you about him.</i>
<i>He's here from the East.</i>

45:07.618 --> 45:10.883
Put down five because my uncle
doesn't want to be bothered
with a lot of questions.

45:10.955 --> 45:13.219
Well, you see,
on a survey, we usually-

45:13.290 --> 45:15.224
<i>[Charlie] He's not interested</i>
<i>in a survey...</i>

45:15.292 --> 45:17.692
<i>and I promised him</i>
<i>he wouldn't be bothered.</i>

45:17.762 --> 45:19.696
Well, we'd like it
if we could get all of you.

45:19.764 --> 45:22.062
You know, your opinions,
what you do
or what you want to do.

45:22.133 --> 45:25.432
My uncle's opinions
aren't average and I'm afraid
they wouldn't help you.

45:25.503 --> 45:28.995
<i>I think when someone</i>
<i>asks for privacy,</i>
<i>they should have it.</i>

45:29.073 --> 45:32.201
Well, we'll-
The whole idea of this
thing is that-

45:32.276 --> 45:35.006
Mr. Graham,
perhaps you'd better
choose another family.

45:35.079 --> 45:39.413
We'll do anything you say,
of course, but this family
seemed right and-

45:39.483 --> 45:41.417
<i>[Emmy] It is a nice family.</i>

45:41.485 --> 45:44.454
Charlie, why don't you let
the young men go ahead
so long as they're here?

45:44.522 --> 45:46.922
Well, all right.

45:46.991 --> 45:49.926
Okay. Saunders, go ahead
and get another shot.

45:49.994 --> 45:54.124
Mrs. Newton, perhaps you could
tell me what organizations
you and your husband belong to.

45:54.198 --> 45:56.132
How about a picture
in the kitchen?

45:56.200 --> 45:59.328
<i>Well, I'm afraid</i>
<i>the kitchen isn't quite</i>
<i>the way I'd like it.</i>

45:59.403 --> 46:01.769
<i>Come along.</i>

46:07.144 --> 46:09.874
If you'll start
by breakin' an egg,
Mrs. Newton.

46:09.947 --> 46:11.881
Oh, but you don't start a cake
by breaking an egg.

46:11.949 --> 46:14.884
You have to put
the butter and sugar in first.

46:14.952 --> 46:17.853
Survey or no survey,
I'm not going to start
by breaking an egg.

46:17.922 --> 46:21.756
<i>I thought I'd make</i>
<i>a maple cake. My brother</i>
<i>Charles loves maple cake.</i>

46:21.826 --> 46:25.125
What does your brother do?
Oh, I guess he just
does about everything.

46:25.196 --> 46:29.132
What does he do?
Oh, he's just in business.
You know, the way men are.

46:29.200 --> 46:33.899
My husband works in a bank,
but I think Charles
is just in business.

46:33.971 --> 46:37.407
<i>[Emmy]</i>
<i>If you really want a picture</i>
<i>of me breaking an egg,</i>

46:37.475 --> 46:40.376
you'll have to wait
till I cream the butter
and sugar.

46:40.444 --> 46:42.344
I'll wait.

46:42.413 --> 46:44.574
I wonder if we
could take a look
at the upstairs?

46:44.648 --> 46:47.674
You show us, and your mother
can call us when she's ready.
All right.

46:47.751 --> 46:49.685
If you'd rather wait,
Mr. Saunders.

46:49.753 --> 46:52.586
Folding in the eggs
has to be done just right.

46:52.656 --> 46:54.590
<i>I can't beat them</i>
<i>and let them stand.</i>

46:54.658 --> 46:57.092
The minute I hear
you've broken the eggs,
I'll come right down.

46:57.161 --> 46:59.288
Yes.

47:04.969 --> 47:07.802
I really don't see
what you want
to look up here for.

47:07.872 --> 47:11.308
Whose room is that?
It's mine. My uncle's
using it now, though.

47:11.375 --> 47:15.175
I'd like to get an idea
what your room looks like.
Typical girl, typical room.

47:15.246 --> 47:17.874
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.

47:17.948 --> 47:20.178
I really don't want
to disturb him.

47:20.251 --> 47:24.711
Is there a back stairs?
Mm-hmm.
Right down the hall.

47:24.788 --> 47:27.484
I'll bet you 50 cents
that your uncle isn't in there.

47:27.558 --> 47:29.492
[Chuckles]
Oh, betting's silly.

47:29.560 --> 47:32.461
All you want to do
is photograph my room.
Doesn't he?

47:32.530 --> 47:35.522
That's it.
Besides, I know
my uncle's in there.

47:35.599 --> 47:38.227
All right,
I'll still bet he isn't.
Let me knock and see.

47:38.302 --> 47:40.964
Oh, I'll knock.

47:41.038 --> 47:43.734
Uncle Charlie?

47:43.807 --> 47:46.139
Uncle Charlie,
may we come in?

47:51.815 --> 47:54.511
See?
You were right.

47:54.585 --> 47:57.418
Nice room. Do you mind
if I take a picture or two
since he isn't here?

47:57.488 --> 48:00.480
I certainly don't want
to disturb your uncle.
Oh, I suppose so.

48:00.558 --> 48:04.255
But I really can't imagine
anyone being interested
in my room.

48:04.328 --> 48:09.231
It's not the way I'd like it.
I'd like to have it all white.
Yellow and white.

48:09.300 --> 48:11.234
Might as well let him
work in peace.

48:11.302 --> 48:15.033
Besides, I'd like
to talk to you.

48:15.105 --> 48:19.064
You know, your picking us
as an average family
gave me a funny feeling.

48:19.143 --> 48:23.102
- What kind of a funny feeling?
- Oh, I don't know.

48:23.180 --> 48:26.047
I guess I don't like
to be an average girl
in an average family.

48:26.116 --> 48:28.175
Average families
are the best. Look at me.

48:28.252 --> 48:30.686
I'm from an average family.
<i>As average as ours?</i>

48:30.754 --> 48:33.052
Sure. Besides, I don't think
you're average.

48:33.123 --> 48:37.560
Oh, that's because
you see me now
instead of a few days ago.

48:37.628 --> 48:43.032
I was in the dumps,
and then Uncle Charlie came
and everything changed.

48:43.100 --> 48:46.069
But your mother said
he only got here last night.
Maybe you just think-

48:46.136 --> 48:49.003
I don't think. I know.

48:49.073 --> 48:54.409
Funny, but when I try to think
of how I feel, I always
come back to Uncle Charlie.

48:54.478 --> 48:58.608
Are you trying to tell me
I shouldn't think
he's so wonderful?

49:00.284 --> 49:03.378
Oh, no. L-
<i>[Emmy] Mr. Saunders?</i>

49:03.454 --> 49:07.220
<i>I'm ready with the eggs.</i>
I hope Mr. Saunders
doesn't move anything in there.

49:07.291 --> 49:11.091
<i>My uncle's awfully neat</i>
<i>and fussy.</i>
Saunders is neat and fussy too.

49:11.161 --> 49:13.629
[Footsteps]

49:15.966 --> 49:20.801
- Is this your uncle
you were telling us about?
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

49:23.507 --> 49:25.998
Now, for one of the hall.

49:26.076 --> 49:30.445
<i>[Shutter Clicks]</i>
<i>[Charlie] Mr. Saunders has</i>
<i>been taking pictures of my room.</i>

49:30.514 --> 49:34.814
My sister told me to remind you
about eggs and a cake.

49:34.885 --> 49:38.082
I don't like to be photographed.
I'll have to ask you for the film.

49:38.155 --> 49:41.420
Oh, Uncle Charlie.
Give it to me, please.

49:41.492 --> 49:44.086
Give it to him, Fred.

49:44.161 --> 49:48.393
That's too bad.
There's a picture
of Mrs. Newton on this film.

49:55.139 --> 49:59.235
Excuse me.
<i>[Emmy] Mr. Saunders,</i>
<i>I'm ready to fold in the eggs.</i>

49:59.310 --> 50:02.074
<i>I can't let them stand</i>
<i>another minute.</i>

50:04.548 --> 50:07.779
[Saunders]
That was my last roll of film.
Oh.

50:07.851 --> 50:10.285
Mr. Saunders took
Uncle Charlie's picture
by mistake...

50:10.354 --> 50:13.118
and Uncle Charlie made him
give him back the roll.

50:13.190 --> 50:15.954
He wasn't joking
about not wanting
to be photographed.

50:16.026 --> 50:17.960
We didn't want to start
a family feud.

50:18.028 --> 50:19.962
I'll get you making the cake
again tomorrow.

50:20.030 --> 50:22.498
I won't be making a cake
again tomorrow.

50:22.566 --> 50:26.161
I want to help an important
work, but I cannot
go on making cakes.

50:26.236 --> 50:29.205
You have helped, Mrs. Newton.

50:29.273 --> 50:31.207
And now I'd like
to ask another favor.

50:31.275 --> 50:34.642
Could I borrow your daughter
for this evening? I'd like
to look around the town.

50:34.712 --> 50:37.681
Ann?
Charlie.

50:37.748 --> 50:41.809
Ann would be better.
Ann knows everything
about everybody.

50:41.885 --> 50:45.753
Charlie.
Well, if, uh,
Charlie doesn't mind.

50:45.823 --> 50:48.348
- I don't mind.
- Swell.

50:55.165 --> 50:56.598
Good-bye, then, Mrs. Newton.
Good-bye.

50:56.667 --> 50:59.101
Half past 6:00?
Half past 6:00.

50:59.169 --> 51:01.603
Okay. Good-bye.
Bye. Bye, Mr. Saunders.

51:01.672 --> 51:03.606
Bye.
Good-bye.

51:05.509 --> 51:07.739
He seems like a nice young man.

51:07.811 --> 51:10.871
But I thought you were
going to the movies
with Catherine.

51:10.948 --> 51:14.179
Oh, I'll tell her
I don't feel well or something.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.833
Hello, Charlie.
Well... hello, Catherine.
Hello, Shirley.

51:32.903 --> 51:37.306
Hello.
This is Jack Graham.
He's in town.

51:37.374 --> 51:39.308
[Together]
How do you do?
Hello.

51:39.376 --> 51:43.938
How's your throat, Charlie?
Oh, much better. Thank you.

51:44.014 --> 51:46.175
Bill Forest was
asking about you.

51:46.250 --> 51:48.810
Oh. Bill Forest?
[Embarrassed Chuckle]

51:48.886 --> 51:51.116
Well, uh, good-bye.

Bye.
Good-bye.
Bye.

51:54.825 --> 51:57.157
[Both Laughing]

52:01.965 --> 52:03.956
I know what you are, really.

52:04.034 --> 52:06.002
You're a detective.

52:06.069 --> 52:08.799
There's something the matter,
and you're a detective.
Charlie, listen.

52:08.872 --> 52:11.966
I don't want to listen.
Why, you're not
on a survey at all.

52:12.042 --> 52:13.976
You lied to us.
You lied to Mother.

52:14.044 --> 52:17.309
You just wanted to get
in our house. Police.

52:17.381 --> 52:19.281
That's what it is.

52:19.349 --> 52:22.648
What do you want with us?
What are you doing around here
lying to us?

52:22.719 --> 52:24.846
Look, Charlie,
you've got to listen to me.
You've got to trust me.

52:24.922 --> 52:26.822
When you've done
nothing but lie?

52:26.890 --> 52:29.688
And you probably didn't want
to take me out at all
the way I thought.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.819
You just wanted to ask me
a lot of questions.

52:31.895 --> 52:34.830
Have I asked you
a lot of questions? Have I?

52:34.898 --> 52:38.356
All right, I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.

52:38.435 --> 52:40.369
Now, won't you even
listen to me?

52:40.437 --> 52:42.837
Why should I
when you lied to me?
I had to.

52:42.906 --> 52:45.841
When I came here to find a man,
I hadn't counted on you.

52:45.909 --> 52:49.675
I hadn't counted on your mother
or your family.
Find a man? What man?

52:49.746 --> 52:52.613
There's a man loose
in this country.
We're after him.

52:52.683 --> 52:55.846
We don't know much.
We don't even know
what he looks like.

52:55.919 --> 53:00.015
Charlie, think.
How much do you know
about your uncle?

53:00.090 --> 53:04.493
Why, he's my mother's brother.
What's he got to do with it?

53:04.561 --> 53:06.529
This man we want
may be your uncle.

53:06.597 --> 53:10.363
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.

53:10.434 --> 53:13.961
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be that man.

53:14.037 --> 53:17.529
But in the East,
there's another man
who's being hunted, too,

53:17.608 --> 53:20.133
through Massachusetts
and into Maine;
he may be the man.

53:20.210 --> 53:22.542
My uncle hasn't done anything.

53:22.613 --> 53:25.446
He knows it would kill
my mother if he did.

53:25.516 --> 53:29.350
He's her younger brother,
just like Roger is mine.

53:29.419 --> 53:31.410
Why don't they arrest
that man in the East?

53:31.488 --> 53:35.117
<i>Why don't you go away</i>
<i>and leave us alone?</i>

53:35.192 --> 53:38.025
Charlie, when we were
eating tonight and talking
about our folks...

53:38.095 --> 53:41.792
and what we'd done and how
we felt, we were like
two ordinary people.

53:41.865 --> 53:43.833
We'd been brought up
about the same.

53:43.901 --> 53:47.894
<i>You liked me and I liked you.</i>
Oh, it doesn't matter now.

53:47.971 --> 53:51.236
What do you mean,
"it doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing that does.

53:51.308 --> 53:53.606
<i>If it weren't for you,</i>
<i>you don't think I'd care...</i>

53:53.677 --> 53:55.736
<i>how or where I caught up</i>
<i>with your uncle, do you?</i>

53:55.812 --> 54:00.306
Because if he's the guy,
I'm going to catch up with him.
Remember that.

54:00.384 --> 54:02.716
<i>And you're going to keep</i>
<i>your mouth shut.</i>

54:02.786 --> 54:05.414
<i>You're going to keep</i>
<i>your mouth shut because</i>
<i>you're such a nice girl...</i>

54:05.489 --> 54:09.289
you'd help if you knew
your uncle was the man
we wanted.

54:09.359 --> 54:12.260
I wouldn't help you.
<i>And I know you would.</i>

54:12.329 --> 54:14.763
And I'm trying
to make it easier for you.

54:14.831 --> 54:17.959
If your uncle's the man we want,
we'll get him out of town quietly.

54:18.035 --> 54:20.936
<i>We won't arrest him here.</i>
Arrest him here in town?
With Mother?

54:21.004 --> 54:23.871
<i>I'm trying to tell you</i>
<i>we won't.</i>

54:25.676 --> 54:29.942
- Please, Charlie.
- I won't say anything.

54:30.013 --> 54:32.379
Oh, take me home!

54:40.857 --> 54:43.655
<i>[Clock Bell Tolling]</i>

54:46.496 --> 54:48.430
Good night, Charlie.

54:48.498 --> 54:51.592
It's going to be funny
when you find out you're wrong.

54:51.668 --> 54:53.829
Good night.

<i>Hello, Charlie. Home already?</i>
Oh, yes, Dad.

55:28.472 --> 55:31.669
It's so nice out, I thought
I'd get a breath of air
before I went to bed.

55:31.742 --> 55:35.178
Well, you better run in.
Your Uncle Charlie's
been asking about you.

55:35.245 --> 55:36.303
I think I'll just go up
the back way.

55:36.380 --> 55:38.405
L-I'm tired and I don't
feel like talking.

55:38.482 --> 55:40.882
All right. Suit yourself.

55:40.951 --> 55:42.885
Take care of yourself.
Mm-hmm.

55:42.953 --> 55:45.581
Good night, Herb.
Good night, Charlie.

55:45.656 --> 55:46.884
Good night, Charlie.

55:46.957 --> 55:50.120
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?

55:50.193 --> 55:52.127
Well, did you taste
anything funny...

55:52.195 --> 55:54.186
about that coffee you had
at my house this evening?

55:54.264 --> 55:56.425
No. It tasted all right.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.730
That's what I mean.
It wasn't all right.

55:58.802 --> 56:01.498
Put something in it?
Put a little soda.

56:01.571 --> 56:05.166
About the same amount
that I'd have used
if I'd wanted to use poison.

56:05.242 --> 56:07.802
Well, you don't say.
I never tasted a thing.

56:07.878 --> 56:11.041
Of course, I might not
notice the soda.

56:11.114 --> 56:14.811
You'd notice the soda more
than you would the poison.
[Scoffs]

56:14.885 --> 56:17.911
For all you knew, you might
just as well be dead now.

56:31.568 --> 56:34.594
[Rustling]

56:47.517 --> 56:50.384
Aren't you asleep yet, Ann?
Uh-uh.

57:02.165 --> 57:04.360
Charlotte, what are you doing?

57:04.434 --> 57:07.494
Oh, I'm just looking
for a recipe I thought I saw,

57:07.571 --> 57:10.199
but it's just so torn up-

57:10.273 --> 57:13.504
They have papers
in the "libarry."
New ones and old ones.

57:13.577 --> 57:15.568
Miss Corcoran
will get them out for you.

57:15.645 --> 57:19.137
She won't even notice
if you cut out
a little, bitty recipe.

57:19.216 --> 57:22.276
Oh, it's not that important.

57:22.352 --> 57:24.320
What time does
the library close?

57:24.387 --> 57:28.847
If you read as much
as you should, you'd know
it closes at 9:00.

57:30.761 --> 57:34.993
Oh, well. If I think about it,
maybe I'll go tomorrow.

57:35.065 --> 57:37.829
You really ought
to go to sleep, Ann.

58:19.709 --> 58:22.542
[Tires Screeching]

58:22.612 --> 58:25.547
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!

58:31.988 --> 58:33.717
[Blows Whistle]

58:37.594 --> 58:40.654
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think
I am out here for?

58:40.730 --> 58:42.925
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Norton.

58:42.999 --> 58:44.933
All right. Go ahead.

59:03.987 --> 59:06.217

Oh! Miss Corcoran,

59:28.278 --> 59:30.109
Oh, please!

59:32.649 --> 59:34.674
Oh, thank you.

59:34.751 --> 59:37.845
Really, Charlie.
You know as well as I do
the library closes at 9:00.

59:37.921 --> 59:40.014
If I make one exception,
I'll have to make a thousand.

59:40.090 --> 59:43.787
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corcoran,
but there is something
in the paper I've got to see.

59:43.860 --> 59:46.328
I'm surprised at you, Charlie.
No consideration.

59:46.396 --> 59:49.331
Oh, I'll only be a minute.
You've got all day,
Charlie, to come here.

59:49.399 --> 59:52.095
I don't know why you want
to rush in here tonight
like a madwoman.

59:52.168 --> 59:54.227
I'll give you
just three minutes.

01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:13.882
[Whispering]
Can't be anything really awful.

01:00:14.724 --> 01:00:17.284
I'll prove to him it isn't.

Where's Charlie?
She's still asleep.
I don't want to wake her.

<i>[Clock Bell Tolling]</i>

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:16.801
Charlie still asleep?
No, she just woke up.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.748
I shouldn't have let her sleep
so long, but she needed it.

01:02:20.817 --> 01:02:24.378
She doesn't look quite herself.
She'll be down for dinner.

Mother, let me finish
mashing those.

I'll fix the rest of dinner
and get it on the table.

01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:53.015
You go talk to Uncle Charlie.

01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:55.051
How do you feel?
Fine.

01:02:55.118 --> 01:02:57.882
I must have been tired.
I slept like a log.

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:01.355
Uncle Charlie was
asking for you again.
He's fond of you.

01:03:01.424 --> 01:03:06.987
And that nice young man
came twice to ask after you.
I told him you were asleep.

01:03:07.063 --> 01:03:12.501
[Humming]
I'm rested now and ready for
anything. Is the gravy made?

01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:17.632
Now you're humming that waltz.
Please don't hum
that tune anymore.

01:03:17.707 --> 01:03:22.144
[Stops]
I've just got it out of my head
and don't want it started again.

01:03:22.212 --> 01:03:24.874
And don't keep getting up
every few minutes.

01:03:24.948 --> 01:03:27.678
You just sit there
and be a real lady.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:32.449
All right, if you say so,
but at least I can
carry in the soup.

01:03:32.522 --> 01:03:37.550
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.

01:03:39.162 --> 01:03:44.190
Mama.
Ann, I told you not to
put things behind your ears.

01:03:44.267 --> 01:03:49.204
And don't whisper. Anyone
could hear you a block away.
May I sit by you at the table?

01:03:49.272 --> 01:03:52.469
<i>By me?</i>
<i>I should think you'd want</i>
<i>to sit by Uncle Charlie.</i>

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:55.875
<i>[Ann]</i>
<i>No, I want to sit by you.</i>
<i>Why do you want to change?</i>

01:03:55.945 --> 01:03:57.845
Mother, let her change
if she wants to.

01:03:57.914 --> 01:04:00.075
Roger doesn't mind.

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:04.314
No, certainly not.
Uncle Charlie might think-
No, certainly not.

01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:09.120
Mother, let her change.
All right, but Ann has
too many foolish ideas.

01:04:09.192 --> 01:04:12.889
Go in the dining room,
both of you.

01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:23.635
What's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?

01:04:23.706 --> 01:04:25.970
<i>Roger wanted</i>
<i>to sit next to you,</i>

01:04:26.042 --> 01:04:29.569
and I thought it would be nice
if the children took turns.

01:04:29.646 --> 01:04:31.580
I never-
Never what, Roger?

01:04:31.648 --> 01:04:35.277
Nothing.
Come, Ann. Come and help me.

01:04:35.351 --> 01:04:40.618
Joe!
I brought it in by mistake.
Nothing special in it.

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:44.057
Want to look at
the headlines, Charles?
Thank you, Joe.

01:04:46.062 --> 01:04:48.895
<i>[Emmy] Roger, don't make</i>
<i>so much noise with your soup.</i>

01:04:48.965 --> 01:04:53.527
<i>[Ann] lfhe holds his lips</i>
<i>close together, he could draw it</i>
<i>carefully, same as a horse.</i>

01:04:53.603 --> 01:04:56.538
<i>[Emmy] Don't be disgusting.</i>
<i>[Roger]</i>
<i>May I dip my bread in it?</i>

01:04:56.606 --> 01:04:59.598
<i>[Joe] Where's Charlie?</i>
<i>[Emmy]</i>
<i>She wanted to serve the dinner.</i>

01:04:59.676 --> 01:05:03.407
<i>She'll be in in a minute.</i>
<i>[Uncle Charlie]</i>
<i>You're right, Joe.</i>

01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:06.744
Nothing special tonight.
Oh, here she is!

01:05:06.816 --> 01:05:09.808
<i>Here's my girl.</i>
<i>I wonder how many</i>
<i>hours you slept.</i>

01:05:09.886 --> 01:05:12.787
If you could tell me
the exact minute
you went to sleep,

01:05:12.855 --> 01:05:16.222
the exact minute you woke up,
if you woke up in between...

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:19.227
and how long you stayed awake
each time you woke up,

01:05:19.295 --> 01:05:21.126
then I could tell you exactly-

01:05:21.197 --> 01:05:25.861
You won't sleep tonight.
Nobody who sleeps all day
can sleep all night.

01:05:25.935 --> 01:05:28.233
I slept all right,
and I kept dreaming-

01:05:28.304 --> 01:05:30.738
perfect nightmares
about you, Uncle Charlie.

01:05:30.807 --> 01:05:33.241
Nightmares about me?

01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:38.474
You were on a train,
running away from something...

01:05:38.548 --> 01:05:42.882
and when I saw you on the train,
I felt terribly happy.

01:05:42.952 --> 01:05:46.649
<i>How could you feel happy</i>
<i>seeing Uncle Charlie</i>
<i>on a train?</i>

01:05:46.723 --> 01:05:50.887
I don't want to see him
on a train. I hope
he stays here forever.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.294
Well, he has to leave sometime.
We have to face the facts.

01:05:55.365 --> 01:05:58.095
I like people who face facts.

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:01.659
Well, we're not going
to face any such facts as those.

01:06:03.273 --> 01:06:06.265
Oh, Ann, would you like
to see the funnies?

01:06:06.342 --> 01:06:10.745
I'm too old for funnies.
I read two books a week.
I took a sacred oath I would.

01:06:10.813 --> 01:06:14.271
Besides, no one's allowed
to read at the table.
It isn't polite.

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:16.147
Don't correct your elders!

01:06:16.219 --> 01:06:18.483
She's right, Emmy.
I'm forgetting my manners.

01:06:18.554 --> 01:06:21.546
Joe, I'm going to blame
this paper on you.

01:06:21.624 --> 01:06:26.823
Roger, go to the icebox
and bring me a big red bottle
you'll find there.

01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:30.229
You can throw the paper away.
Dad's read it, you've read it.

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.894
We don't need to play any
games with it tonight.

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:36.097
<i>[Emmy]</i>
<i>Ann, you can help Charlie</i>
<i>carry in the vegetables.</i>

01:06:36.172 --> 01:06:38.663
<i>[Emmy] I saw that bottle</i>
<i>when I was getting dinner.</i>

01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:42.734
You know what St. Paul said:
"Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake."

01:06:42.812 --> 01:06:44.973
Wine for dinner...
Sounds so gay!

01:06:45.048 --> 01:06:49.348
Remember the time they
had the champagne when
the oldestJones girl got married?

01:06:49.419 --> 01:06:51.216
This is sparkling burgundy.

01:06:51.287 --> 01:06:56.054
One sip and I'll be calling it
"sparkling burgledy."

01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.389
<i>[Emmy] Maybe I'd better</i>
<i>not take any.</i>

01:06:58.461 --> 01:07:00.827
Oh... imported.

01:07:00.897 --> 01:07:03.525
Imported Frankie and his tweeds?

01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:05.760
And his loaded cane.

01:07:05.835 --> 01:07:08.201
His loaded everything!

01:07:08.271 --> 01:07:11.434
<i>[Emmy, Uncle Charlie</i>
<i>Laughing]</i>

01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:18.006
<i>[Emmy] Roger, go get four of</i>
<i>the small glasses with stems.</i>

01:07:18.081 --> 01:07:23.678
<i>Charles, I promised Mrs. Greene,</i>
<i>the president of our club,</i>
<i>that you'd talk to the ladies.</i>

01:07:23.753 --> 01:07:28.452
What am I going to talk about?
Lecturers usually give travel
or current events.

01:07:28.524 --> 01:07:30.788
Oh, not current events.
We <i>get</i> current events.

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.055
<i>[Uncle Charlie]</i>
<i>What sort of an</i>
<i>audience will it be?</i>

01:07:33.129 --> 01:07:36.656
<i>[Cork Popping]</i>
Oh, women like myself.
Busy with our homes, most of us.

01:07:36.733 --> 01:07:39.065
<i>Women keep busy</i>
<i>in towns like this.</i>

01:07:39.135 --> 01:07:44.437
In the cities it's different:
Middle-aged widows,
husbands dead;

01:07:44.507 --> 01:07:49.604
<i>husbands who've spent</i>
<i>their lives making fortunes,</i>
<i>working and working,</i>

01:07:49.679 --> 01:07:54.048
<i>and then they die and leave</i>
<i>their money to their wives-</i>
<i>their silly wives.</i>

01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:57.848
And what do the wives do,
these useless women?

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.584
You see them in the best hotels
every day by the thousands;

01:08:02.658 --> 01:08:05.092
drinking the money,
eating the money,

01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:08.324
losing the money at bridge,
playing all day and all night,

01:08:08.398 --> 01:08:10.525
smelling of money.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.297
Proud of their jewelry,
but of nothing else.

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:19.136
Horrible, faded, fat,
greedy women.

01:08:19.207 --> 01:08:22.700
<i>[Charlie] But they're alive!</i>
<i>They're human beings!</i>

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.942
Are they? Are they, Charlie?

01:08:26.015 --> 01:08:30.349
<i>Are they human or are they fat,</i>
<i>wheezing animals? Hmm?</i>

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.857
And what happens to animals
when they get too fat and too old?

01:08:34.924 --> 01:08:37.620
Well, I seem to be making
my speech right here.

01:08:37.693 --> 01:08:43.598
Don't talk about women
like that in front of my club!
You'll be tarred and feathered.

01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:48.796
And that nice Mrs. Potter's
going to be there too.
She was asking me about you.

01:08:48.871 --> 01:08:54.002
The Greenes are bringing her
here to the party I'm having
for you after the lecture.

01:08:54.076 --> 01:08:56.203
<i>Joe, it's Herbert.</i>

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:59.009
[Quietly]
He always comes
when we're eating.

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:04.115
<i>[Place Setting Clanging]</i>
Good evening, Mrs. Newton.

01:09:04.187 --> 01:09:06.747
Good evening, Mr. Oakley.
Good evening.

<i>[Emmy] Well, Herb,</i>
<i>how's your mother?</i>

01:09:09.658 --> 01:09:11.593
Oh, she's just middling.

01:09:12.828 --> 01:09:16.765
Had your dinner?
Oh, I had mine an hour ago.

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:21.532
You folks are getting pretty stylish.
Having dinner later every evening.

01:09:21.604 --> 01:09:23.537
[Joe]
Ha, ha!

01:09:28.211 --> 01:09:30.270
Joe.
<i>Huh?</i>

01:09:30.345 --> 01:09:36.046
Joe, l-I picked some
mushrooms before dinner.
You don't say.

01:09:36.118 --> 01:09:38.951
Mushrooms mean anything
to you, Joe?

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:44.323
I eat 'em on my steak when
I'm out and the meat's not
good enough as 'tis.

01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:46.657
If I brought you
some mushrooms,
would you eat 'em?

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:48.662
Suppose I would. Why?

01:09:48.731 --> 01:09:53.862
Then I've got it, you see?
The worst I'd be accused of
would be manslaughter.

01:09:53.935 --> 01:09:57.770
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death,
pure and simple.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.539
A basket of good
mushrooms and...
two or three poisonous ones.

01:10:02.612 --> 01:10:07.379
No, no. Innocent
party might get
the poisonous ones.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:09.941
I thought of something better
when I was shaving.

01:10:10.019 --> 01:10:15.252
A bath tub.
Pull the legs out from
under you, hold you down.

01:10:15.324 --> 01:10:17.087
It's been done,
but it's still good.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.051
<i>[Charlie]</i>
<i>Oh, what's the matter</i>
<i>with you two?</i>

01:10:20.129 --> 01:10:22.723
Do you always have to
talk about killing people?

01:10:22.798 --> 01:10:24.891
We're not talking about
killing people.

01:10:24.967 --> 01:10:28.061
Herb's talking about
killing me, and I'm
talking about killing him.

01:10:28.137 --> 01:10:30.196
It's your father's
way of relaxing.

01:10:30.273 --> 01:10:32.503
Can't he find some
other way to relax?

01:10:32.575 --> 01:10:37.342
Can't we have a little peace
and quiet here without dragging
in poisons all the time?

01:10:37.413 --> 01:10:40.507
<i>[Emmy]</i>
<i>Charlie! She doesn't make</i>
<i>sense talking like that.</i>

01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:42.983
<i>I'm worried about her.</i>
<i>Roger, bring her back.</i>

01:10:43.052 --> 01:10:47.284
I'll go. You stay
and finish dinner.
I'll catch up with her.

01:10:47.356 --> 01:10:49.756
<i>[Emmy]</i>
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

01:10:59.168 --> 01:11:01.728
[Officer Blows Whistle]

01:11:01.804 --> 01:11:06.036
Excuse me, Mr. Norton.
You're always running
along the street at night.

01:11:06.108 --> 01:11:09.976
Say, where were you going
in such a hurry last night?
Just doing an errand.

01:11:10.046 --> 01:11:13.447
Is this gentleman your uncle
I've heard so much about?
Yes.

01:11:13.516 --> 01:11:16.917
Uncle Charlie, Mr. Norton.
Glad to know you.
What's the name?

01:11:16.986 --> 01:11:19.352
Oakley. Charles Oakley.
Nice to meet you.

01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:23.916
Better keep your eye on your
niece. I'll have to give her
a ticket for speeding.

01:11:23.993 --> 01:11:27.394
City ordinance about running
along these sidewalks.
Hear that, Charlie?

01:11:27.463 --> 01:11:32.526
Don't want to break the law.
I'll take care of her.
Good night.

01:11:32.602 --> 01:11:35.901
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:48.210
I want to talk to you.
You're hurting my arm again.

01:11:48.284 --> 01:11:51.412
You're coming here with me.
I can't. I've never been
in a place like this.

01:11:51.487 --> 01:11:53.421
Go on in.

01:12:06.802 --> 01:12:09.737
Why'd you bring me here?
What does it matter
where we are?

01:12:09.805 --> 01:12:11.739
Hello, Charlie. Hello.

01:12:11.807 --> 01:12:15.971
Hello, Louise. Uncle Charlie,
Louise Finch.
Hello.

01:12:16.045 --> 01:12:20.675
This is my uncle.
I was in Charlie's
class in school.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:24.982
I sure was surprised to
see you come in. I never
thought I'd see you here.

01:12:25.054 --> 01:12:29.115
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job over at Kern's.

01:12:29.191 --> 01:12:33.184
I've been in half the
restaurants in town.
What'll you have, Charlie?

01:12:33.262 --> 01:12:38.632
Nothing, thank you.
Bring her some ginger ale.
I'll have a double brandy.

01:12:38.701 --> 01:12:42.262
Well, Charlie.
Well?

01:12:42.338 --> 01:12:46.468
Think you know something,
don't you? That young
fellow told you something.

01:12:46.542 --> 01:12:49.409
Jack? Why should he
know anything about you?

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:56.948
Now look, Charlie.
Something's come between us.
I don't want that to happen.

01:12:57.019 --> 01:13:01.979
Why, we're old friends.
More than that.

01:13:03.059 --> 01:13:04.890
We're like twins.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.361
You said so yourself.
Don't touch me, Uncle Charlie.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.865
What did that boy tell you?

01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:18.896
He's got nothing to do with it.
I hope he never knows
anything about you.

01:13:18.974 --> 01:13:24.742
Charlie, you're a pretty
understanding sort of girl.

01:13:27.683 --> 01:13:30.447
If you've heard some
little things about me,

01:13:30.519 --> 01:13:34.819
I guess you're
a woman of the world
enough to overlook them.

01:13:37.827 --> 01:13:42.230
You're the head of
your family, Charlie.
Anyone can see that.

01:13:42.298 --> 01:13:47.861
I'm not so old. I've been
chasing around the globe
since I was sixteen.

01:13:49.739 --> 01:13:52.264
<i>I guess I've done some</i>
<i>pretty foolish things, ;</i>

01:13:52.341 --> 01:13:55.003
made some pretty
foolish mistakes.

01:13:55.077 --> 01:13:58.945
<i>Nothing serious.</i>
<i>Just... foolish.</i>

01:14:13.496 --> 01:14:15.623
[Chuckles]

01:14:15.698 --> 01:14:19.634
Oh, Charlie, now, don't start
imagining things.

01:14:19.702 --> 01:14:25.004
How could you do such things?
You're my uncle.

01:14:25.074 --> 01:14:26.939
<i>My mother's brother.</i>

01:14:27.009 --> 01:14:30.968
We thought you were
the most wonderful
man in the world.

01:14:31.046 --> 01:14:34.641
- The most wonderful
and the best.
- Charlie, what do you know?

01:14:43.592 --> 01:14:46.254
I'm sorry I was so long.
We're awful busy.

01:14:48.464 --> 01:14:51.865
Whose is it?
Ain't it beautiful?

01:14:53.169 --> 01:14:57.003
I'd just die for
a ring like that.

01:14:57.072 --> 01:15:01.031
Yes sir, for a ring like that,
I'd just about die.

01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:04.511
I love jewelry- real jewelry.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:09.279
Notice I didn't even have
to ask if it was real.
You can tell.

01:15:09.351 --> 01:15:12.149
I can.
Bring me another brandy.

01:15:13.989 --> 01:15:16.321
Sit down.

01:15:16.392 --> 01:15:18.326
Sit down!

01:15:22.131 --> 01:15:25.362
You think you know
something, don't you?

01:15:25.434 --> 01:15:28.562
You think you're
the clever little girl
who knows something.

01:15:28.637 --> 01:15:32.573
There's so much you
don't know. So much.

01:15:32.641 --> 01:15:34.871
What do you know really?

01:15:34.944 --> 01:15:38.573
You're just an ordinary
little girl living in
an ordinary little town.

01:15:38.647 --> 01:15:42.845
You wake up every morning and
know perfectly there's nothing
in the world to trouble you.

01:15:42.918 --> 01:15:45.819
You go through your
ordinary little day...

01:15:45.888 --> 01:15:51.758
and at night, you sleep your
untroubled ordinary sleep filled
with peaceful, stupid dreams.

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:55.695
And I brought you nightmares.

01:15:57.299 --> 01:16:00.757
Or did I? Or was it
a silly inexpert little lie?

01:16:00.836 --> 01:16:04.272
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker- blind.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:07.070
How do you know what
the world is like?

01:16:07.142 --> 01:16:10.043
Do you know the world
is a foul sty?

01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:14.640
<i>Do you know if you ripped</i>
<i>the fronts off houses,</i>
<i>you'd find swine?</i>

01:16:14.717 --> 01:16:17.208
The world's a hell.
What does it matter
what happens in it?

01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:21.086
<i>Wake up, Charlie.</i>
<i>Use your wits.</i>
<i>Learn something!</i>

01:16:21.156 --> 01:16:23.090
You goin', Charlie?

01:16:23.959 --> 01:16:26.951
<i>[Raucous Laughter]</i>

01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:46.171
Charlie, will you help me?
Help you?

01:16:46.248 --> 01:16:51.584
The same blood flows through
our veins, Charlie. A week ago,
I was at the end of my rope.

01:16:53.122 --> 01:16:57.525
Oh, I'm so tired.
There's an end to
the running a man can do.

01:16:57.593 --> 01:17:01.495
You'll never know what
it's like to be so tired.
I was going to-

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:09.668
Well... Then I got the idea
of coming out here.
It's my last chance, Charlie.

01:17:10.339 --> 01:17:12.273
Give it to me.

01:17:13.475 --> 01:17:15.500
Graham and the other fellow,
they don't know.

01:17:15.577 --> 01:17:19.707
There's a man in the east.
They suspect him, too.
And if they get him, I'll-

01:17:19.782 --> 01:17:23.411
Charlie, give me
this last chance.

01:17:23.485 --> 01:17:26.010
Take your chance. Go!

01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:28.989
I'll go, Charlie.
Just give me a few days.

01:17:29.058 --> 01:17:31.686
Think of your mother.
It'll kill your mother.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.161
Yes, it would kill my mother.

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:38.631
Take your few days.
See that you get
away from here.

01:17:38.701 --> 01:17:41.966
You realize what it'll mean
if they get me?

01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:44.130
The electric chair.

01:17:44.206 --> 01:17:47.835
[Sobs]
Charlie, you've got to help me.
I count on you.

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:53.212
You said yourself we're no
ordinary uncle and niece,
no matter what I've done.

01:17:53.282 --> 01:17:56.547
You go in. I'll be in
in a minute.

<i>[Uncle Charlie]</i>
<i>East, west, home's best.</i>
<i>[Emmy] Where's Charlie?</i>

01:18:14.136 --> 01:18:17.162
<i>She's outside.</i>
<i>Don't worry about her.</i>
<i>What was the matter?</i>

01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:21.733
<i>She was a little edgy.</i>
<i>I persuaded her to go for</i>
<i>a walk. She's calmed down now.</i>

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:27.214
<i>I'm so glad. I've saved</i>
<i>dessert for you, Charles.</i>
<i>[Charles] We had an ice-cream soda.</i>

<i>[Emmy] Roger, come here!</i>
No!

01:19:02.918 --> 01:19:06.547
There's my girl. Psst! Ann!

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:09.921
Hello! You must be trying
to hide or something.

01:19:09.992 --> 01:19:14.156
We're not hiding.
People who are hiding
always say "psst."

01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:16.959
We just don't want
to yell on Sunday.
Look, Ann.

01:19:17.032 --> 01:19:21.799
Ask your sister to run over here
for a minute. Just ask her
quietly. We'll wait here.

01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:25.533
Did my father and your
father have a feud?
My father?

01:19:25.607 --> 01:19:29.668
Because if they didn't,
there's no sense in my
asking Charlotte quietly.

01:19:29.745 --> 01:19:33.237
Mama won't care.
She thinks girls ought to
marry and settle down.

01:19:33.315 --> 01:19:36.182
In a book I'm reading-
Just ask her, Ann.
Don't be literary.

01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:38.947
All right.
Remember, I'm doing
all the talking.

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:47.928
<i>[Charlie] Hello.</i>
Hello. Hello, Catherine.

01:19:47.996 --> 01:19:50.294
Good morning, Mr. Graham.

01:19:50.365 --> 01:19:53.459
Catherine, this is
Mr. Saunders.

01:19:53.535 --> 01:19:56.003
How do you do?
How do you do?

01:19:56.071 --> 01:19:59.472
Ann says you want
to speak to me.
Saunders wants to speak to you.

01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:05.411
Come on, Ann. Tell Catherine
the story of Dracula.
Come on, Catherine.

01:20:07.216 --> 01:20:11.448
What do you want?
Let them get a
little bit ahead.

01:20:16.992 --> 01:20:21.224
I, uh, want to tell you about
that photograph we took.
The one of your uncle?

01:20:21.296 --> 01:20:24.788
You gave it back to him.
He probably burned it.
Not that one he hasn't.

01:20:24.867 --> 01:20:27.199
We gave him the wrong film.

01:20:27.269 --> 01:20:29.635
We got the picture all right.
We wired it east.

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:32.731
They've got witnesses
can identify the man we want
from that picture.

01:20:32.808 --> 01:20:35.333
What do you mean,
identify him?
Just what I said.

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:38.709
The minute the witnesses see
that picture, we'll know
whether Oakley's the man.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.908
We're waiting for the wire now.
And then Uncle Charlie will be-

01:20:41.984 --> 01:20:45.351
That's right.
That's the way it is.

01:20:47.956 --> 01:20:52.586
Graham thought you could get
your uncle to leave town now.
It would be better for-

01:20:52.661 --> 01:20:56.563
I've got to, haven't I?
I've got to! What's the
most time you'll give me?

01:20:56.632 --> 01:20:58.156
Two hours.

01:20:58.233 --> 01:21:00.565
I'll make him leave!

01:21:00.636 --> 01:21:03.605
You seem pretty sure
he's the man we want. Why?

01:21:03.672 --> 01:21:08.166
No reason why. I'm just scared.
You're the ones who seem sure.

01:21:08.243 --> 01:21:13.112
It's just that I can't stand
for anything to happen here.
You know what he's done?

01:21:13.182 --> 01:21:15.946
No, I don't want to hear!
Well, I want you to get this.

01:21:16.018 --> 01:21:21.251
We're really doing you a favor.
If you know anything more about
your uncle, let's have it!

01:21:21.323 --> 01:21:23.757
We also want to know
when and how he leaves town.

01:21:23.825 --> 01:21:26.419
If you hold out on us-
I won't. I'll tell you.

01:21:28.297 --> 01:21:31.391
[Ann]
Step on a crack,
you'll break your mother's back.

01:21:31.466 --> 01:21:34.162
I wish I knew we
could trust you.

01:21:34.236 --> 01:21:37.637
I won't do anything
to help him, I promise.

01:21:37.706 --> 01:21:40.675
But you can't ask me
to spy on him.

01:21:40.742 --> 01:21:44.508
We've made a bargain.
I'll get him to leave.
That's all I'll do.

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:47.378
Think, Charlie.
The man's dangerous.
If he gets away from us-

01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:52.614
I don't want to hear
what he'll do. We've made
a bargain. I'll keep it.

01:21:52.688 --> 01:21:55.316
I'll let you know
when he leaves.

01:21:55.390 --> 01:22:00.327
Funny if he turned out
to be the wrong man.
Could be.

01:22:00.395 --> 01:22:04.559
<i>Ann.</i>
I broke my mother's
back three times.

01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:08.865
Not bad. You didn't finish
telling me whether Miss Rose
married the rich guy...

01:22:08.937 --> 01:22:11.963
or the one she was in love with.
How long have you two
been so friendly?

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.635
Oh, we play games.
I ask questions. She
knows all the answers.

01:22:15.711 --> 01:22:18.680
The only trouble is
I can't make out
what she's making up.

01:22:18.747 --> 01:22:23.980
I never make up anything.
I get everything from my books.
They're all true.

01:22:24.052 --> 01:22:28.113
Come on, Ann. We'd better
get home and help
with dinner. Good-bye.

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:31.785
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Graham.
Mr. Saunders.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.953
Good-bye, Catherine.
<i>Come on, Catherine.</i>

01:22:34.029 --> 01:22:38.625
Why don't you pick some
flowers for the dinner table?
Simple flowers are the best.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:42.227
I didn't ask for orchids.
<i>[Ann] I wish I'd</i>
<i>been born in the South.</i>

01:22:42.304 --> 01:22:45.637
<i>Southern women have a lot</i>
<i>of charm. They pick</i>
<i>flowers with gloves on.</i>

01:22:45.707 --> 01:22:48.335
Good-bye, Catherine.
Good-bye, Charlie.
See you after dinner.

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:49.843
Bye.

01:22:51.079 --> 01:22:53.513
<i>- Hello, Ann.</i>
- Hello.

01:22:53.582 --> 01:22:58.451
How was church, Charlie?
Did you count the house?
Turn anybody away?

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.954
No, room enough for everyone.

01:23:01.023 --> 01:23:03.218
I'm glad to hear that.

01:23:03.292 --> 01:23:07.524

a long time, I thought maybe
attendance might be falling off.

01:23:07.596 --> 01:23:10.429
<i>Anything special on</i>
<i>the noon broadcast?</i>

01:23:10.499 --> 01:23:14.868
A fellow said they caught
that other fellow-
the Merry Widow Murderer.

01:23:14.936 --> 01:23:18.235
<i>They did, did they? Where?</i>
<i>State of Maine. Portland.</i>

01:23:18.307 --> 01:23:21.799
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away
from the police,

01:23:21.877 --> 01:23:26.439
and they were just about to nab
him, at the airport, and he ran
into the propeller of a plane.

01:23:26.515 --> 01:23:30.952
Ooh, boy!
Cut him all to pieces. Had
to identify him by his clothes.

01:23:31.019 --> 01:23:35.046
His shirts were all initialed,
"C," "O," apostrophe "H."

01:23:35.123 --> 01:23:37.717
Well, makes a good ending.
Couldn't have done
better myself.

01:23:37.793 --> 01:23:40.159
I guess that closes
that case pretty final.

01:23:40.228 --> 01:23:43.493
<i>Sure does. Never cared</i>
<i>much for that case.</i>

01:23:43.565 --> 01:23:49.265
Well, I think I'll go get
ready for dinner. I'm hungry.
I can eat a good dinner today.

01:24:47.562 --> 01:24:51.760
Charlie, I have
great news for you.
Where can we talk alone?

01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:08.340
We got a wire from Maine,
so we can call off the job.
I'll bet you're relieved. I am.

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:10.351
Oh, I am relieved.

01:25:10.419 --> 01:25:14.082
<i>Here you were trying to get</i>
<i>your uncle out of town. He must</i>
<i>have thought you were crazy.</i>

01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:17.353
Now that it's over, I don't
want to talk about it anymore.

01:25:17.426 --> 01:25:20.156
I'd like to pretend the whole
dreadful thing never happened.

01:25:20.228 --> 01:25:24.562
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to pretend about.</i>
There's mother's gloves.

01:25:24.633 --> 01:25:27.659
Mother and her gloves.
She's always losing things.

01:25:27.736 --> 01:25:31.137
<i>All mothers lose things.</i>
<i>Someday, she'll be losing you.</i>

01:25:31.206 --> 01:25:35.006
Mothers don't lose daughters,
they gain sons.

01:25:35.076 --> 01:25:38.534
That's right. But gain
isn't always the word.
Now take me.

01:25:38.613 --> 01:25:41.013
Who'd want a detective
for a son-in-law?

01:25:41.082 --> 01:25:43.346
My father would.
He would?

01:25:43.418 --> 01:25:48.822
If you said to him, " Father,
I'm going to marry a detective,"
he wouldn't disown you?

01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:50.915
It wouldn't have to be me.
There's Ann.

01:25:50.992 --> 01:25:55.292
No. Ann wants to marry
a librarian. She told me.

01:25:55.363 --> 01:25:59.129
So she'll always have plenty
of books around to read.
[Laughing]

01:26:01.069 --> 01:26:03.060
What's the matter?

01:26:03.138 --> 01:26:06.869
I was laughing.
It's been so long
since I laughed.

01:26:06.942 --> 01:26:08.637
I like it when you laugh.

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:14.046
I like it when you don't.
I guess I like you
whatever you do.

01:26:14.115 --> 01:26:18.677
I guess I like you.
I'm glad. I like you too.

01:26:18.753 --> 01:26:24.055
Funny how you happen to meet
someone and like them and...
<i>like</i> them.

01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:26.218
Mm-hmm.

01:26:26.294 --> 01:26:28.057
Charlie?
Yes?

01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:33.089
I suppose it couldn't ever
really happen some day that
you'd tell your father-

01:26:33.168 --> 01:26:37.036
You know, about
marrying someone-
a detective, I mean.

01:26:37.105 --> 01:26:40.268
I don't know.
I didn't mean to tell you.

01:26:40.342 --> 01:26:43.800
I wanted to wait until you'd
forgotten all the mess
we've been through together;

01:26:43.879 --> 01:26:46.746
till you could stop
thinking of me as something
unpleasant and frightening.

01:26:46.815 --> 01:26:51.582
I wanted to wait and come back
and then tell you.

01:26:51.653 --> 01:26:54.053
But I can't help it.
I want to tell you now.

01:26:54.122 --> 01:26:57.785
I love you, Charlie.
I love you terribly.

01:26:57.859 --> 01:27:02.125
I know it's no time
to tell you now and
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

01:27:02.197 --> 01:27:05.030
I don't mind.
Do you think you
could think about it?

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:10.834
About your loving me?
And perhaps your loving me.

01:27:10.906 --> 01:27:16.310
L-I'd like us to be
friends. I know that.
We <i>are</i> friends.

01:27:16.378 --> 01:27:20.075
I'd like to have
that to think about.
Nothing more?

01:27:20.148 --> 01:27:24.448
I don't know, Jack.
I... just don't know yet.

01:27:24.519 --> 01:27:27.920
All right. But I may
come back?

01:27:27.989 --> 01:27:32.551
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.

01:27:33.562 --> 01:27:35.496
Listen, Charlie.

01:27:35.564 --> 01:27:38.294
When I go,
go back to that square
in the middle of town.

01:27:38.366 --> 01:27:42.132
Take a good look at it.
That's where I first knew
I loved you.

01:27:42.203 --> 01:27:46.230
That's where we had the fight.
I didn't know what to do.

01:27:46.308 --> 01:27:49.334
I like my job, but I
didn't like it that night.

01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:51.504
I hated it that night.

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:54.708
You hate it now?
No, not now.

01:27:56.484 --> 01:28:01.319

we sat in the parlor.
Hello, Mr. Oakley.

I was saying
good-bye to Charlie.
In the garage?

01:28:30.452 --> 01:28:32.386
The door got stuck.

01:28:32.454 --> 01:28:34.388
Now I'll have to say
good-bye to you.

01:28:34.456 --> 01:28:38.222
Let's say good-bye out here
on the lawn. No use taking
a chance on the garage.

01:35:55.263 --> 01:35:57.458
If I have a band,
I'm a-least have 87 men.

01:35:57.532 --> 01:36:00.695
<i>[Continues]</i>
Help, everybody!
Somebody's caught in the garage.

01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:03.862
They're suffocating!
There's something
the matter with the door.

01:36:03.938 --> 01:36:05.872
Joe!

01:36:29.864 --> 01:36:32.230
I'll take her. I've got her.

01:36:35.636 --> 01:36:38.867
Joe, there's a bottle
of whiskey on my bureau.
Get it quick.

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:41.807
Charlie. Charlie.
Dear Charlie.
Charlie?

01:36:41.876 --> 01:36:44.845
Emmy, rub her feet.
Roger, run get something
to fan her with.

01:36:44.912 --> 01:36:47.506
Charlie!

01:36:47.582 --> 01:36:50.107
<i>[Emmy] Ann, don't, dear.</i>

01:36:50.184 --> 01:36:53.551
[Moans]
Charlie? What are you
trying to say, Charlie?

01:36:58.359 --> 01:37:00.554
Go away.

01:37:00.628 --> 01:37:02.459
<i>Go away.</i>

01:37:03.764 --> 01:37:05.857
<i>[Uncle Charlie]</i>
<i>Emmy, she wants you.</i>

01:37:05.933 --> 01:37:10.529
I'm here, darling.
Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.

01:37:10.605 --> 01:37:14.666
That's right,
my brave little girl. Here...

01:37:14.742 --> 01:37:17.074
Take a little sip of this.
No- I'm all right.

01:37:17.145 --> 01:37:22.139
Joe, call Dr. Phillips.
No, I'm all right.
I just want to get up.

01:37:22.216 --> 01:37:26.243
You had a wonderful escape,
Charlie. Someone must have
left the motor running.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.847
I couldn't find the key to turn
it off.
The key was there
when I went in.

01:37:29.924 --> 01:37:32.222
Lucky thing I passed by.

01:37:32.293 --> 01:37:35.922
She might have died.
You saved her.
You knew just what to do.

01:37:35.997 --> 01:37:40.331
- Don't know how I happened
to come across that way.
- We'll put the lecture off.

01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:45.134
Oh, yes, there is.
I want you all to go.
There's the cab now.

01:37:45.206 --> 01:37:47.868
Oh, I couldn't.
I just couldn't go.

01:37:47.942 --> 01:37:51.469
Wh-Who found me in the garage?

01:37:51.546 --> 01:37:53.912
<i>[Joe] Herb heard you</i>
<i>beating on the door.</i>

01:37:53.981 --> 01:37:58.077
<i>I was coming across the backyard,</i>
<i>and I heard this gaspin'</i>
<i>and beatin'on the door.</i>

01:37:58.152 --> 01:38:01.121
I figured there must be
a human bein' in there.

01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:03.589
Quick thinking, Herb.
<i>Lucky thing.</i>

01:38:03.658 --> 01:38:06.058
I'm glad you happened
to be going by, Herb.

01:38:06.127 --> 01:38:08.561
<i>Come on, Mother.</i>

01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:10.654
L-I want to stay with you.

01:38:10.731 --> 01:38:15.430
I don't feel like making a
speech now. When I think what
might have happened to Charlie.

01:38:15.503 --> 01:38:19.564
I'm all right. I just
want to sit on the porch
awhile and get the air.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.574
No, darling,
I won't hear of it.

01:38:21.642 --> 01:38:26.773
I'm all right, really.
I'd rather stay home and get
things ready for the party.

01:38:26.847 --> 01:38:29.372
Darling, I want
to stay with you.

01:38:34.455 --> 01:38:38.357
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.

01:38:38.426 --> 01:38:40.417
<i>[Car Starts]</i>

First the stairs and-

01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:07.519
Mr. Graham isn't there?

01:39:07.588 --> 01:39:09.522
[Sighing]

01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:12.889
This is the Hotel Stewart
in Fresno, isn't it?

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.485
And you don't expect him?

01:39:15.563 --> 01:39:18.623
I see. Thank you.

01:39:18.699 --> 01:39:23.762
He isn't there?
Thank you very much. Good-bye.

01:39:23.838 --> 01:39:26.636
Can you tell me
where I can reach him?

01:39:26.707 --> 01:39:30.905
I've already tried
to get him at the address
he gave me in Fresno.

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:34.314
Thank you.

01:40:10.718 --> 01:40:13.050
[Indistinct Chattering]

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.054
Mom, may we have
some sandwiches?

01:40:15.122 --> 01:40:19.115
Don't take anything
from the dining room.
Go in the kitchen.

01:40:19.193 --> 01:40:22.424
<i>Please go in.</i>
<i>Andjust leave your coats-</i>

01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:26.165

01:40:26.233 --> 01:40:27.860
<i>Charlie!</i>

01:40:27.935 --> 01:40:29.869
I'll be right down.

01:40:29.937 --> 01:40:33.031
<i>[Herb] Well... now... hmm.</i>

01:40:35.543 --> 01:40:40.640
Now, now, Mr. Oakley.
I thought champagne was
only for battleships.

01:40:40.715 --> 01:40:46.449
None for me and none, I'm sure,
for my wife. But we hope
you'll all forget we're here.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.853
I'd like to propose a toast to-
Isn't Charlie coming down?

01:40:49.924 --> 01:40:52.916
She'll be down in a moment.
Mrs. Potter.

01:40:52.993 --> 01:40:57.896
Don't take that one. I don't
know why I make tomato. They
always soak through the bread.

01:40:57.965 --> 01:41:02.834
Try one of these. It's just
whole wheat bread and cream
cheese. Paprika makes it pink.

01:41:02.903 --> 01:41:05.235
[Uncle Charlie] Mr. Greene.
Mrs. Greene, what
would you like?

01:41:05.306 --> 01:41:07.240
Thank you.

01:41:07.308 --> 01:41:10.300
I think I'd like to
propose a toast, too.
Emmy.

01:41:10.378 --> 01:41:15.714
To our distinguished visitor,
The man who's made the best
speech heard in town for years.

01:41:15.783 --> 01:41:18.877
To that very good fellow,
Mr. Oakley.

01:41:18.953 --> 01:41:21.751

01:41:28.829 --> 01:41:32.458
Ah, here she is.
Now for my toast.

01:41:40.775 --> 01:41:42.709
Charlie...

01:41:44.578 --> 01:41:47.012
you're just in time
for a farewell toast.

01:41:47.081 --> 01:41:52.109
I hate to break the news
to you like this, but tomorrow
I must leave Santa Rosa.

01:41:52.186 --> 01:41:55.451
Not forever.
If that isn't
the strangest coincidence.

01:41:55.523 --> 01:41:58.185
<i>[Mrs. Potter] I was planning</i>
<i>to go to San Francisco tomorrow.</i>
Charles.

01:41:59.894 --> 01:42:02.886
Oh, Emmy darling,
I didn't mean to
spoil your fun tonight.

01:42:02.963 --> 01:42:06.763
I got a letter today.
I have to catch
the early morning train.

01:42:07.701 --> 01:42:09.635
I'll miss you, Emmy.

01:42:13.474 --> 01:42:17.706
But I want you all to know
that I'll always think
of this lovely town...

01:42:19.013 --> 01:42:21.948
<i>as a place ofhospitality</i>
<i>and kindness...</i>

01:42:23.083 --> 01:42:26.052
<i>and homes... homes.</i>

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.989
- But I can't bear it
if you go, Charles.
- Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.

01:42:31.058 --> 01:42:36.860
<i>I've arranged with</i>
<i>Dr. Phillips for our little</i>
<i>memorial for the children.</i>

01:42:37.865 --> 01:42:40.356
It isn't any
of the things you've done.

01:42:42.069 --> 01:42:47.564
It's just the idea that
we were together again.
I'm sorry!

01:42:47.641 --> 01:42:51.737
<i>But you see, we were</i>
<i>so close growing up.</i>

01:42:51.812 --> 01:42:55.475
And then Charles went away,
and I got married, and-

01:42:56.784 --> 01:42:58.877
<i>Then you know how it is.</i>

01:43:00.554 --> 01:43:04.888
<i>You sort of forget you're you.</i>
<i>You're your husband's wife-</i>

01:43:06.594 --> 01:43:09.757
We'll be looking for you.
We feel you're one of us,
don't we, Margaret?

01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:13.561
Indeed. I want to thank
you on behalf of our club.

01:43:13.634 --> 01:43:15.659
And bless you for your
gift to our hospital.

01:43:15.736 --> 01:43:19.570
The children will bless you,
too, in the years to come.
Thank you, sir.

<i>[Steam Whistle Blowing]</i>
Excuse me, sir, but l-I can
hear the train coming now.

All right. Good-bye,
everybody. Roger, Ann,
come see the train.

01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:46.866
Come on, Charlie.
You can see they get off.

01:43:46.934 --> 01:43:48.765
All right.

<i>I want to see the rooms,</i>
<i>the private ones.</i>

and one lower with Papa.

01:43:55.576 --> 01:43:58.443
Good-bye, Joe.
Good-bye, Charles.

01:43:58.512 --> 01:44:01.913
Good-bye, Emmy.
Good-bye. And don't
forget to write!

01:44:01.982 --> 01:44:06.043
I will. You write too.
I'll send you my address.

01:44:11.225 --> 01:44:13.159
Good-bye.

01:44:16.564 --> 01:44:18.964
Don't jump on the seats, Roger.

01:44:20.868 --> 01:44:23.132
Roger, what did I tell you?

01:44:26.574 --> 01:44:30.670
Porter, there's one more bag.
It got taken into the other car.
Will you get it please?

01:44:30.744 --> 01:44:34.475
Charlie, the train's
going to start. I don't
want to get carried away.

01:44:34.548 --> 01:44:37.449
Maybe it's too late!
Maybe I'll have to go along!

01:44:37.518 --> 01:44:39.782
There's plenty of time.
You run along, we'll follow.

01:44:39.853 --> 01:44:42.014
Charlie.

01:44:42.089 --> 01:44:44.990
Just a minute.

01:44:45.059 --> 01:44:48.825
I want you to know
I think you were right
to make me leave.

01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:53.427
It's best for your mother.
Best for all of us.

01:44:55.102 --> 01:44:58.265
You saw what happened
to her last night.

01:44:58.339 --> 01:45:03.174
She's not very strong,
you know. I don't think
she could stand the shock.

01:45:03.243 --> 01:45:06.440
I remember once when
she was a little girl-
The train's moving!

01:45:06.513 --> 01:45:12.509
Listen, Charlie. I want you to
forget all about me. Forget
that I ever came to Santa Rosa.

01:45:14.154 --> 01:45:15.985
Your hands!

01:45:18.092 --> 01:45:21.152
Let me go, Uncle Charlie!
Let me go!

01:45:24.632 --> 01:45:26.998
I've got to do this, Charlie...

01:45:27.067 --> 01:45:29.433
so long as you know
what you do about me.

01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:44.913
Not yet, Charlie.
Let it get a little faster.

01:45:45.786 --> 01:45:47.481
Just a little faster.

01:45:47.554 --> 01:45:48.987
Faster.
