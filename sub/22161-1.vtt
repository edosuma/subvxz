WEBVTT

00:06.172 --> 00:07.424
{\an7}&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE IT ALL

00:07.507 --> 00:08.675
{\an7}HAPPENED, LAGUNA BEACH,

00:08.758 --> 00:09.426
{\an7}CALIFORNIA, A SMALL TOWN IN

00:09.509 --> 00:12.262
{\an7}THE O.C. WHERE I GREW UP.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.138
{\an7}I JUST FINISHED MY SENIOR

00:13.221 --> 00:14.431
{\an7}YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL,

00:14.514 --> 00:16.391
{\an7}A YEAR I'LL NEVER FORGET.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.809
{\an7}I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS

00:17.892 --> 00:19.018
{\an7}MY FRIENDS, ESPECIALLY

00:19.102 --> 00:20.478
{\an7}MY BEST FRIEND, LO.

00:20.562 --> 00:21.479
{\an7}NO MATTER HOW CRAZY

00:21.563 --> 00:22.522
{\an7}IT GOT THIS YEAR,

00:22.605 --> 00:24.232
{\an7}I COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON LO.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.443
{\an7}THAT'S CHRISTINA.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.319
{\an7}SHE'S THE REVEREND'S DAUGHTER.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.070
{\an7}NO, REALLY, SHE IS.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.406
{\an7}THERE'S MORGAN.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.115
{\an7}HER GOAL IS TO SAVE HERSELF

00:32.198 --> 00:34.492
{\an7}FOR THE RIGHT GUY.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.744
{\an7}THAT'S TREY.

00:35.827 --> 00:36.745
{\an7}I GUESS YOU COULD SAY HE WAS

00:36.828 --> 00:38.037
{\an7}THE SERIOUS ONE.

00:38.121 --> 00:38.538
{\an7}BUT HE ALSO HAD THE BEST

00:38.621 --> 00:41.040
{\an7}PARTY HOUSE IN LAGUNA.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.917
{\an7}THAT GUY ON THE SURFBOARD?

00:43.001 --> 00:43.960
{\an7}THAT'S TALAN.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.170
{\an7}HE'S A JUNIOR AND HE'S HOOKED UP

00:45.253 --> 00:46.337
{\an7}WITH MOST OF THE GIRLS

00:46.421 --> 00:48.173
{\an7}AT OUR SCHOOL...TWICE.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.759
{\an7}THAT, THAT WOULD BE KRISTIN,

00:50.842 --> 00:52.051
{\an7}ANOTHER JUNIOR.

00:52.135 --> 00:52.510
{\an7}WHEREVER KRISTIN WENT,

00:52.594 --> 00:54.137
{\an7}DRAMA FOLLOWED.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.056
{\an7}SHE THINKS SHE'S HOT.

00:57.140 --> 00:57.515
{\an7}OKAY, I GUESS SHE IS,

00:57.599 --> 01:00.602
{\an7}BUT SHE CAN'T STAND ME.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.061
{\an7}HERE'S THE REASON WHY:

01:02.145 --> 01:04.230
{\an7}STEPHEN.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.105
{\an7}I GUESS HE'S KIND OF HER

01:05.190 --> 01:06.399
{\an7}BOYFRIEND, BUT STEPHEN AND I

01:06.483 --> 01:07.901
{\an7}HAVE BEEN REALLY CLOSE FOREVER.

01:07.984 --> 01:08.485
{\an7}WE'RE EVEN GOING TO COLLEGE

01:08.568 --> 01:10.195
{\an7}TOGETHER IN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.529
{\an7}KRISTIN'S THE WRONG GIRL

01:11.613 --> 01:12.614
{\an7}FOR HIM.

01:12.697 --> 01:13.573
{\an7}I'M JUST WAITING FOR HIM

01:13.656 --> 01:14.991
{\an7}TO FIGURE IT OUT.

01:15.074 --> 01:15.992
{\an7}OH, AND ME?

01:16.075 --> 01:16.868
{\an7}I'M LAUREN.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.328
{\an7}MY FRIENDS CALL ME L.C.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.371
{\an7}I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE NICE GIRL.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.956
{\an7}BUT THIS YEAR, I REALIZED

01:22.040 --> 01:22.499

01:22.582 --> 01:25.710
{\an7}GO AFTER WHAT YOU WANT.

01:25.794 --> 01:26.586
{\an7}AND ALL THIS DRAMA STARTED AT
