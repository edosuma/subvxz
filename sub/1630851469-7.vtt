00:15.000 --> 00:19.920
Our intel has Torben Jensen in
London. He's in contact with the bias link to Daesh.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.720
-Wait, don't come in.
-I have your food.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.000
How many more times? I
don't know where Torben is.

00:29.000 --> 00:29.920
That's him.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Halt! Stop!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh, fuck! No! Kelvin's been killed.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.960
Your asshole boyfriend betrayed me.
We had an agreement.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.920
I have information you're going to be
interested in.

00:46.000 --> 00:46.920
Redback.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Who is Redback?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.920
Beatrice, they're arresting your father.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.920
Take your hands off me.

00:53.000 --> 00:53.920
What? No.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.920
Your father is working for Moscow.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.920
He's here voluntarily. What's changed?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.840
He's being charged under the Official Secrets
Act.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.200
Heard about William.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.000
Is any of it true?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.960
Whatever you think you have on him,

01:07.040 --> 01:09.880
William Ogilvy will walk.
And when he does,

01:09.960 --> 01:11.000
he'll be coming for you.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.040
God, you look terrible.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Have they interrogated Sergov?

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
He offered them a deal. They took it.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
What evidence did he conjure up?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.120
He says you're working for Russia.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.080
They told me that Counter Terrorism
found VX traces at your house.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.400
Well, of course they did.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.880
So, they're working on a theory that Oleg
Adamov spent the night--

02:16.960 --> 02:19.000
Insignificant amount of time.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.920
Levi thinks it proves a connection.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.040
Indicates. It doesn't prove anything. God
almighty, Beatrice.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.880
This made me an
accessory to the murder of Glen Whitehall.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.840
Has he even considered the possibility that
I've been set up?

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
I'm working on that.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
And in the meantime I imagine he's shut his
decks and gone running to Dame Iris.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.040
He called her last night.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.920
And she's ordered the exfiltration of all our
agents from Moscow?

02:47.000 --> 02:47.960
With immediate effect.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.160
Can they not even think one fucking move
ahead?

02:53.120 --> 02:57.720
Neutralize the primary obstacle,
weaken resources and strike.

02:59.400 --> 03:05.480
This is Redback.
As sure as night follows day.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000

04:11.000 --> 04:16.480
Marcus, I want all the CCTV from outside my
father's house pulled for the last week.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.520
And that includes any half-assed security
that his neighbors have got.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.600
So, doorbell monitors, dash cams.
I want everything, front and back.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.000
Same goes for this office and for
Sergov's club.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.120
All right? Get a team on it.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.880
Nobody leaves here till we found out how that
nerve agent got in his house.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.920
Also, I want
Katrine Poulsen in for a debrief.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.360
-What time?
-10:30?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.240
And how is your dad coping with the slam?

04:35.720 --> 04:38.720
Like boarding school, but more consensual.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.920
He says Redback's imminent.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.520
And he should know.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.040
Naughty step.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.760
I spoke to the DG yesterday and he wanted
your security clearance revoked.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.680
I fought your
corner. Was that a mistake?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.280
What? Supporting one of your team?

05:03.360 --> 05:06.920
Team? Can you put aside what happened
yesterday and focus on Redback?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.840
Finding out who set up my father and
stopping Redback are the same thing.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.960
I strongly advised you not to visit him and you
ignored me.

05:14.040 --> 05:14.960
Should I have ordered you not to
go?

05:15.040 --> 05:17.840
The Russians want us to think that William is
Redback.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.920
They want us looking the other way,
exactly the moment that it's gonna happen.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.400
Do you have proof it's a setup?

05:23.480 --> 05:24.920
If I had proof, I'd have given it to you.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.880
Right. No communication with your
father while this is sub judice.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.920
Is that an order?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Yes, Beatrice! That's an order!

05:48.000 --> 05:49.200
Beatrice?

05:49.280 --> 05:51.360
Received an encryption from Green
Source.

05:51.440 --> 05:57.000
I ran it through the program and... this
is what came up.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.920
That's a Jsteg. Forward it to me.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.920
Do you know the first ever recorded instance
of steganography?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.920
Histiaeus. 6th century BC.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yes. Correct.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.920
Well, I can never remember how he did it.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.440
OK, so Histiaeus's army are under
siege and he's got to send for help.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.840
Then he's like,

06:16.920 --> 06:17.800
"I'll know what I will do.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.520
I will shave a slave's
head,

06:19.600 --> 06:21.320
tattoo a message on it,

06:21.400 --> 06:24.120
wait for the hair
to grow back and send him off."

06:24.200 --> 06:27.480
When thou art come to Miletus,
bid them shave thy head

06:27.560 --> 06:29.600
and look thereon - genius.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.000
You're talking to yourself, mate.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.920
That was rude.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.920
Jelena.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.920
Like I predicted, Daesh London have the
bio-fuels.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.920
Torben Jensen?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.920
We think so.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.920
Did they mention the code Redback?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.680
I don't know. I'll find out.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.680
The attack is
planned for tonight.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.600
Cathedral of Sound
nightclub.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.920
OK. Where are you now?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.200
GRU. Empty office in the basement.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.480
Are you not worried about intercepts?

07:20.560 --> 07:21.960
I know how to hack-proof my PDA.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.920
Well, who else knows?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.520
We have to act on this.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.800
How many at the GRU know about this,
Jelena?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.920
Look, before I pass on this
information,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.720
I want assurances that we'll get
Jelena Alakin and her daughter

07:37.800 --> 07:38.920
across the
border to Finland.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.400
Wait, let me get this straight.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.960
You've got information that could
benefit the UK and save lives,

07:44.040 --> 07:46.120
and you're gonna withhold it
unless...

07:46.200 --> 07:48.240
No, look. Course I won't, but...

07:48.320 --> 07:50.560
I also have a
duty to protect my agent.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.240
Your first duty's to your country.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.160
Do you remember what they did to Ludmila
Ganev?

07:56.120 --> 07:56.960
Yeah, they nailed her in a coffin
and they cremated her.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.600
Of course I remember.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.200
So, don't lecture me on duty.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.920
OK. What's the information?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
A bio-fuels attack, on a London nightclub,
tonight.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.920
Torben Jensen's back in play?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.920
So they believe.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.920
Where did this intel originate from?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.760
So, GRU have got a sleeper with Daesh
in Syria. Five years.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.000
if all goes as planned, how
many casualties are we talking?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.000
The nightclub holds 600.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.920
Why haven't the GRU passed this on?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.920
Their agent is too valuable to compromise.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
So, let hundreds dies to save one life? Same
game, different rules.

08:47.000 --> 08:47.920
Shall I go?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.720
No. Get me Counter Terrorism command.
Commander Landau.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.680
Wait. Hold on, hold on. So, look, apart from
the GRU agent,

08:54.760 --> 08:57.440
the only people who have this
information are Jelena and her boss.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.600
So, if we
send in uniformed officers now,

09:00.680 --> 09:01.920
Moscow's
gonna know that Jelena was the tip-off.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.800
We've got to act on this. We don't have a
choice.

09:03.880 --> 09:04.680
Not immediately.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.520
All right, look. They're not gonna
attack until the nightclub's full.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.160
Ten hours to the Finnish border.
We can get Jelena to safety.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.240
-Declan?
-Yeah, I'm on hold.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.720
What are you gonna say to him?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.080
Clear the surrounding area, get eyes on the
target,

09:17.160 --> 09:18.920
-check the threat level.
-I've got Landau.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Look, I can't lose another agent. Please.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.920
Talk to Jelena. Organize the escape. I'm
giving you 30 minutes.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.920
30 minutes? At least let me get her clear of
Moscow.

09:31.000 --> 09:31.920
You're wasting time.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Fuck.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.920
Right, I'm setting up your escape, but you
need to be ready.

09:49.000 --> 09:49.920
I can't leave Tiana.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.920
I know. You're gonna bring her with you.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.920
If I'm caught, I'm dead.

09:54.000 --> 09:54.920
You're not gonna get caught.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.920
They will kill me, and they don't let witnesses
survive.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.960
Look, they're not gonna kill a four-year-old
child.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.920
Beatrice, how long have you been doing
this?

10:03.000 --> 10:03.920
Jelena--

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Wait. Give me a second.

10:06.080 --> 10:11.280
Tiana has play time in an hour.
I'm going to see her.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.800
We don't have an hour!

10:12.880 --> 10:14.720
I'm going to see my daughter.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.240
My mother will
pick her up after school.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.200
Promise me, you'll
bring her to the UK.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.920
Look, I promise, but we don't have time.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.520
If Tiana is not with me within a week,

10:24.600 --> 10:26.240
I will go
back for her.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.920
Do you understand? I will go
back.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.600
I know you will. Jelena--

10:32.680 --> 10:34.400
Jelena?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.920
Fuck. Yes?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
5You need to see this.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.520
CCTV outside the club, two hours ago.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.800
That's their beer cellar.
Owner says it hasn't been used for years.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.680
What are they loading in?

10:52.760 --> 10:53.920
I don't know. Their belongings?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.160
In oil drums, yeah?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.200
Couldn't possibly be
bio-fuels?

10:57.280 --> 10:59.960
I've informed the CTC.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.920
Commander Landau's on his way.
He's gonna wanna speak to you.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.320
No, I know Landau, all right? He's gonna
wanna storm the building.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.000
He's gonna take appropriate action.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.600
Jelena put her life in her hands, right?
You promised her time.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.200
The circumstances changed and I responded.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.360
That's it.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.920
Yes?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.920
Jelena, something's changed.
You need to get out immediately.

11:21.000 --> 11:21.800
No!

11:22.320 --> 11:24.680
-Jelena.
-Not without seeing my daughter.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.840
But you don't have time.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.520
Jelena? Fuck!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You're out of shape, girl.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.960
Are the GRU still sharing Daesh intel from
Syria?

11:42.040 --> 11:44.000
We get some decent cuts.

11:45.040 --> 11:45.960
That's gonna stop.

11:46.040 --> 11:46.960
Unless what?

11:47.040 --> 11:50.920
We have intel that indicates an action by
Daesh in London.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.920
How sure are you?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.920
Personally, not sure at all. But my boss is
insisting on immediate preventative action.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.960
Which would expose the GRU mole in Syria.

11:59.040 --> 12:03.000
No more decent cuts. That's based on flawed
intel.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
How immediate is this immediate action?

12:07.040 --> 12:09.920
Commander Landau is on his way to Thames
House now.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.920
Landau? Fairly immediate then.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.960
If you can get me one hour, I will know if this
threat is real.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.920
And if the intel's flawed, our information
streams continues.

12:19.000 --> 12:19.920
I guarantee it.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And if the intel's accurate?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
We have time to stop it.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.920
I've got Commander Landau downstairs
calling his heels.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.600
Oh? How is he?

12:43.720 --> 12:45.000
He's fucking peachy.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.880
Downing Street have
ordered the CTC to stand down

12:47.960 --> 12:49.400
and await
further orders.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.760
That's risky.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.040
Extremely risky.

12:52.120 --> 12:56.360
Apparently, they were
operating on advice sent from Vauxhall Cross.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.480
How did they get involved?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.600
Number Ten will change their orders?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.200
Once they get the full facts.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.360
You didn't do this to buy Jelena Alakin more
time?

13:08.400 --> 13:09.920
Well, I wish I had that clout.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.080
Don't. Just don't.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.160
What if Vauxhall decide to
let this attack go ahead?

13:15.640 --> 13:18.040
What if, in their
big-dick wisdom,

13:18.120 --> 13:21.640
they decide that protecting
the bona fides of one GRU mole

13:21.720 --> 13:24.760
is more
important than saving the lives of 600 people.

13:24.840 --> 13:25.920
They won't do that.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.720
You're sure about that?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.200
What?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.040
Cathedral of Sound DJ
has canceled their set tonight.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Bummer. I hear she's pure flames.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.520
Her old man is MI6.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.360
OK. They've got their job
and I've got mine.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.560
Got something.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.880
-What?
-It's gonna help your dad.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.640
OK, one second.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.840
Declan? This is what I need.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.720
Little Duck?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.920
Sergei Borsutzky. He's the boss. He speaks
English.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.920
Your handwriting's terrible.

14:23.000 --> 14:23.920
Can you just do this now?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.440
-Now?
-Yes, now.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.720
I know you didn't ask,

14:32.800 --> 14:35.240
but I pulled the CCTV
from our underground car park.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.280
That's your dad's car.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.920
Right, I want that whole area tested.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.040
Already on it.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Well done, Marcus.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.000
I was two years in juvey.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Oh, I didn't know.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Your dad knew.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.960
And he gave you the job?

15:13.040 --> 15:17.000
He said two years in juvey was better than a
double-first from Oxford.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.720
Thanks for coming in.

15:32.200 --> 15:37.000
You know this
man? Gavriil Sergov.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.920
I need to speak to him.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.920
His club's ten minutes away.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I can't leave the building right now.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
You want me to bring him in?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Preferably alive.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
This is to help your father, yes?

15:54.040 --> 15:56.000
Of course.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.960
Hey. I've talked to Little Duck guy.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.680
Pick-up set for Karpovich Bakery,
one o'clock, Moscow time, yeah?

16:20.000 --> 16:20.920
OK.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.080
Also,

16:22.160 --> 16:24.680
Commander Landau is in room one and
he would like to speak with you.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.120
Well, he can wait.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.800
He's pretty insistent.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.360
Yeah, good for him.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.760
OK, Jelena? I've arranged
your pick-up.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.320
Fine. I'll see Tiana,
then head whatever you want me to.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.680
I'm trying to save your life here.
Can you...

16:41.760 --> 16:42.920
Tiana is my life.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I've gained us an hour of which 45 minutes
are left.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.920
After that Counter Terrorism could go
in and your cover's blown.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.480
OK. What do I need to know?

16:52.560 --> 16:56.800
OK, we're using a driver who's
smuggled agents out of Russia before.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.000
His van will
be registered to Little Duck.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.920
Little Duck have links with the Chechen
mafia.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.400
I know. We did a deal.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.520
-No.
-Look, Jelena...

17:06.600 --> 17:07.760
If something's wrong, it's wrong.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.160
We did a deal for exactly this.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.200
The van is perfect cover.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.600
OK. Tell me.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.040
Right, the pick-up is Karpovich Bakery. One
o'clock, your time.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.280
OK? He's not gonna wait.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.400
The driver will ask you for directions to
Petrovsky Street.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.080
You'll say you live near
there. The driver will open the door.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.280
In Finland
you'll be met by two British Embassy officials

17:30.360 --> 17:31.640
who will drive you to Tromsø.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.000
Tiana!

17:37.960 --> 17:41.960
And then from there,
you'll fly to London... Jelena?

17:42.040 --> 17:43.480
-Jelena?
-What?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Good luck.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.680
Cathedral of Sound nightclub.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.640
Surveillance vehicles
here, here and here.

18:05.720 --> 18:09.600
Four officers in each.
Four points of entry.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.280
I managed to drop
a wire down the cellar gate.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.600
Thermal imaging.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.480
Six in total. Three men, three women.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.560
A lovely
little rats' nest.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.480
How long will it take?

18:20.560 --> 18:23.400
If our intelligence is correct,
could be all over in 30 seconds.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.640
-Hey.
-Hey. How are you?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.920
Is Beatrice pissed off? I'm late.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
I think you're OK. Beatrice is up to
here.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.560
Who's the uniform?

18:44.800 --> 18:48.840
What? I save your Prime Minister's
life and I'm still a security risk?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.280
So, what do you think?

19:00.360 --> 19:04.600
Do you think that's
how the VX got into my father's house?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.920
That's his car.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.760
You have proof that's a nerve agent?

19:10.840 --> 19:12.920
These
things can be dangerous.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Do you know, pretty soon

19:14.080 --> 19:15.560
your bullshit statement

19:15.640 --> 19:17.640
will be the only thing
that they can hold him on.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.680
No, no, no, no. What he did on that film...

19:20.760 --> 19:23.280
We need my father here!

19:23.360 --> 19:25.840
In your statement you accuse him
of working with the Russians.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.920
You need to withdraw that.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.760
Why would I do that?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.200
Because you know it won't stick.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.920
Will it? And
when he gets out...

19:34.000 --> 19:36.400
When he gets out, what?

19:36.480 --> 19:40.000
He's going to come
for me, all guns blazing?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.920
My father was 19 years in Belfast
and came through unscathed.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.920
Not my impression.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.880
Do you think I give a fuck about your
impression?

19:51.800 --> 19:53.600
I mean, look at you. You're
sweating like a prince.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.440
My father isn't the all-guns-blazing
type, but he gets stuff done.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.120
Why did you set him up?

20:02.360 --> 20:03.920
I'd like to go.

20:05.160 --> 20:09.600
See, I know you can't be bought,
so who's threatening you?

20:09.720 --> 20:11.400
Apart from you, no one.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.120
Sorry, but I really think you need to know this.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.480
One second.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.000
My father has some friends who
are incredibly loyal.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.480
I just met one. He was charming.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.400
Right, but they don't often get a chance to
prove just how loyal that they can be.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.680
You can go.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.000
What is it?

20:45.640 --> 20:46.720
Levi talked to Downing Street

20:46.800 --> 20:49.880
and the Home Secretary's
overturned the previous order.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.000
5CTC have set up surveillance outside the
nightclub.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Oh, you're f---

20:56.000 --> 20:57.920
I don't think you should go in there.

20:58.000 --> 20:58.920
Why?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.600
Well, Landau wants to arrest you.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.880
Your boyfriend stole bio-fuels

21:04.960 --> 21:06.840
and sold them to
Daesh.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.840
Just... just let Beatrice handle it, OK?

21:11.960 --> 21:13.480
Jelena's not even in the car yet

21:13.560 --> 21:15.360
and you've got
SVs surrounding the nightclub?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.480
I'm amazed they're keeping you operational.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.960
What?

21:19.040 --> 21:19.960
Your father.

21:21.000 --> 21:21.920
My father's been framed.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.920
Not what I'm hearing.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.920
The SVs are unmarked.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.920
Oh, well, great! That'll fool any GRU spooks
that are down there!

21:28.000 --> 21:30.920
Have you proof GRU agents are monitoring
the building?

21:31.000 --> 21:31.920
This is bullshit!

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Any intel to suggest they might be?

21:34.440 --> 21:35.520
We don't have any.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.320
Yeah. Well then, what's the problem?

21:37.400 --> 21:38.920
Where are you getting these images
from?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.560
Nightclub basement.

21:40.640 --> 21:44.200
One officer in a telecoms uniform drilled a
hole, dropped the wire.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.440
Somebody take her
phone and PDA.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.680
I want her in a secure area
until this is over.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.080
Are you serious?

21:51.160 --> 21:54.000
Yes. I am deadly fucking serious.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.640
You allow her to wander around her
while we're dealing with a critical threat

21:57.720 --> 21:59.480
created by her boyfriend?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Can we follow protocols, please?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.360
Yeah.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.920
Would Torben Jensen know how to use
bio-fuels as a weapon? Answer the question.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Torben wouldn't know how to operate a tin
opener.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.920
Could he instruct whoever bought the process
how to store the fuel safely?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
What do you mean?

22:25.000 --> 22:29.680
The BF 100 process creates an incredibly
volatile, highly incendiary liquid.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.400
One spark could flash-fry
every living soul in that building.

22:35.000 --> 22:35.960
Who are they?

22:36.040 --> 22:37.800
You don't know?

22:37.880 --> 22:39.440
Our intels says they're Daesh.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.920
Three men. Three women.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.920
And where are the bio-fuels?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.920
What? You don't know about moving the oil
drums into the basement?

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
No, but my question!
Where are the bio-fuels?

22:49.120 --> 22:51.000
Thermal imaging would have
picked them up.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.240
We're here because your dipshit
boyfriend sold Daesh WMDs.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.920
It's a bit more complicated than that.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.160
Your fuck buddy has embroiled us in a mass
slaughter scenario

23:01.240 --> 23:04.840
and you've the neck to
waltz in here and question my authority?

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
There are no bio-fuels in there.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.080
Thermal imaging doesn't see through
concrete.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.760
We don't know how many rooms are
down there.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.560
I do.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.000
Yeah, I checked the architectural plan.
The basement is one area.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.000
Also, this isn't Daesh.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
How the fuck would you know?

23:27.840 --> 23:30.000
Well, let's assume that they bought the
process,

23:30.080 --> 23:33.280
spent millions on one massive hit.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.920
You see? That's a pregnant woman.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.800
Do you think that's Daesh
suicide squad?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Could it be squatters?

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
The intel is wrong. It's a canary trap.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.920
Jelena. Fuck.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.160
Sergei, you need to contact your driver.
You need to abort the pick-up.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.920
Yeah, abort the pick-up. I'll contact
the target.

24:03.000 --> 24:03.920
Did the intel come from your agent?

24:04.000 --> 24:04.920
Yes.

24:05.000 --> 24:05.920
OK. What time is the pick-up?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.240
Now.

24:07.320 --> 24:11.720
Right, Jelena, when you get this
message, do not get in the van, all right?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.560
You
go back to work. You're being watched.

24:13.640 --> 24:14.880
And if you're in the van,

24:14.960 --> 24:18.120
then you've got to warn the
driver that you're being followed.

24:36.000 --> 24:36.920
Any news?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.960
No, I don't know where she is. I don't know if
she's got in the van.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.920
If her phone's off she must be in the van.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.680
We could have helped her if you
hadn't pulled agents out.

24:44.800 --> 24:45.760
We didn't have a choice. William...

24:45.840 --> 24:47.280
Yeah, I don't wanna hear this!

24:49.400 --> 24:51.440
It's
just fucking rigi

24:51.520 --> 24:58.000
d thinking. Yes? Thank you.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.920
Little Duck boss, they had a lookout at the
pick-up. Jelena got in the van.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Let me go to the Embassy and see what they
can do.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Come on.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.200
The prison governor is a member of my club.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.200
I
talked to your daughter.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.320
You know what I did.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.120
I
had no choice.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.840
Some of the men who used my
club after the raid,

26:03.920 --> 26:06.680
they would have had me
killed.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.080
At least with you it would be quick.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.160
I'm
here to explain.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.880
I don't want you as my enemy.

26:31.080 --> 26:34.960
Right now, my hands are tied, but very soon
this will be over.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.720
When you get out... anything
you want.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.240
Anything.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.760
Call me and it's yours

26:53.560 --> 26:57.000
William!

27:03.720 --> 27:05.880
Suddenly doing things by the book is wrong?

27:05.960 --> 27:07.960
Rigid thinking.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.680
When I joined 3 PARA,

27:09.760 --> 27:12.680
platoon sergeant, black guy, took me aside.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.120
He said, "In this regiment you're allowed one
fuck-up.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.760
Being black, you've already made it."

27:18.840 --> 27:22.000
I have to do things by the book.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.760
Anything from the Embassy?

27:24.840 --> 27:25.720
Still on hold.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.040
Sergei Borsutzky's been trying to
contact you.

27:29.000 --> 27:29.960
What?

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
Their driver? Found his body.

27:34.000 --> 27:34.920
What happened?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.920
Doesn't know. Got a call from the
police.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.920
Jelena, yes!

27:40.000 --> 27:43.920
Beatrice, I'm in Toshino Park. Three
men are after me.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.920
All right, well, we're gonna get help
to you, so keep moving. Find a crowd and--

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Let me fucking go!

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Jelena...

27:55.000 --> 27:58.240
Yes, we have an agent in Toshino
Park. She's being pursued.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.720
She is in grave danger.
Repeat, grave danger.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.920
-Declan?
-I'm trying to find her. I'm on it.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
-With an exact location.
-I am on it. I'm trying.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.840
Beatrice. Please, turn off your
phone.

28:19.920 --> 28:24.920
Don't watch anything
from your phone. Please.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.960
Don't watch.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.000
Let me go!

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Fuck. No.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I'm sorry, Beatrice.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Beatrice...

30:25.040 --> 30:29.000
Fucking hell.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.080
You think she might quit?

31:27.120 --> 31:27.920
Open it.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.920
Why?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.080
Because you might have to delete it, mate.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.480
What if it's something horrific?

31:37.320 --> 31:40.000
She's on the verge of quitting
and you tip her over the edge?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.000
Come in.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.360
Sorry.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.080
I was fixing your phone and I accidently
clicked on a message.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.120
It's a Jsteg.

32:08.200 --> 32:12.880
The time it was sent was when
she was in Toshino Park.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.200
Double-click on the image.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.240
The coordinates are for Copenhagen,

32:21.320 --> 32:23.800
about half a mile from where
Katrine Poulsen was living.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.920
I already opened it. Sorry.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.600
Why did
Jelena send them?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.040
There's a body buried there.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.920
Beatrice... We need to strategize.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.920
The Copenhagen flight leaves in one hour.

32:45.000 --> 32:45.920
You need to rest,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.440
Yeah, I'll do that on the flight.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.480
Look, Katrine
Poulsen must not know about this, all right?

32:50.560 --> 32:53.040
Send those coordinates to the Copenhagen
police.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.160
I want the whole location cordoned off.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.920
Get Forensics down there and an excavation
team.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.520
Beatrice, no.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.560
We shouldn't have even been in
Denmark in the first place.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.360
This needs to go to
the Foreign Office.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.600
Jelena knew that she was gonna die

33:05.680 --> 33:08.360
and the last thing that she did
was send me those coordinates,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.280
so fuck the Foreign Office
and fuck you.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.200
Hello, Miss Ogilvy.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.440
Just over here.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.000
OK. Let's start, then.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
[forensic speaking Danish]

35:10.000 --> 35:12.920
Katrine.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
[speaking Danish]

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
[speaks Danish]

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Uh, English?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.600
Grief vampires.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.440
They might know about the
loss.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.280
But the guilt.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.960
5They infect each other.
Grow like tumors.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.040
Does it ever stop?

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
You can make it stop. I did.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.000
How?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.240
I decided to kill myself.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.160
And then...

36:36.120 --> 36:38.160
Then there
was an angel.

36:43.640 --> 36:48.200
Don't talk to them. Use your pain.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.040
Katrine.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.360
You have been coming
here for 6 months

36:55.640 --> 36:58.640
Are you ready to share?

37:00.920 --> 37:03.920
Ok. That's fine.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.720
Perhaps you can tell us who it was.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.880
The one you lost.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
My syster

37:32.000 --> 37:34.040
Hey. Hey, hey! Hello!

37:35.040 --> 37:38.960
And I thought you were special. I asked you
not to talk to them.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.920
I said two words.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.920
That's all it needed. Everybody in that room
knows everything.

37:45.000 --> 37:45.920
OK. How?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.280
The tone of your voice.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.200
You told them it was
your younger sister.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.640
Much younger sister.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.400
A
sister you felt responsible for.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.800
You practically
brought her up.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.680
You saved her from your
mother. But before you know it

37:59.760 --> 38:00.960
your sister is a teenager.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.400
You're shouting at her and she's
screaming back at you.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.600
And, one day, bang!

38:04.680 --> 38:06.880
You're turning into your own mother.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.400
And she's had enough.
She goes back

38:09.480 --> 38:11.840
and within a week she's dead.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.360
Your junkie mother sets

38:13.440 --> 38:15.760
fire to the apartment.

38:16.840 --> 38:20.720
She crawls out, but your
sister never does.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Who are you?

38:51.000 --> 38:52.560
I'm going to tell you something.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.080
But if discovered, it will put me
in prison for the rest of my life.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.920
Well, I should probably tell you who I work for.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I know who you work for.

39:08.000 --> 39:08.920
Your GRU?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.480
I'm not the GRU.

39:11.800 --> 39:17.680
I work for Russia.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.760
More than
any other nation in the world,

39:19.840 --> 39:22.480
Russia knows
the pain and suffering and loss.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.240
That's why
we assumed the role of world peacekeepers.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.080
Our presence keeps the other powers in
balance.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.840
Not many outsiders understand the
Russian mindset.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.040
I thought you would.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.600
The job you do.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.240
Do you know the evils which are
done in the name of democracy?

39:52.760 --> 39:58.480
The West.
So good at turning a blind eye.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.800
Colonial atrocities. Slavery.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.720
Never-ending wars against
the Third World.

40:03.800 --> 40:08.360
And then they tell us
they are civilized.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.320
I'm going to take a chance with you.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.840
I'm going to tell you something

40:16.920 --> 40:19.960
and what you do with it, it's up to you.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.840
If there's police waiting for me,

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
then I've got it
wrong.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.560
But if I'm right, your life, Katrine...

40:31.520 --> 40:33.880
Your life will begin again.

40:41.120 --> 40:44.400
-You cannot come in!
-I have your supper.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.720
-Can you just put it outside.
-Really?

40:48.600 --> 40:50.760
Follow the rules
and you have nothing to fear.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.440
What would you do
if I came in anyway?

40:58.720 --> 41:01.720
"Then I would have to kill you!"

41:03.320 --> 41:05.600
-Torben?
-Just let me finish this.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.920
Ow!

41:26.240 --> 41:28.400
Katrine? Katrine?

41:30.360 --> 41:33.000
-Can you move?
-No, don't touch me!

41:35.120 --> 41:37.040
Hold my hand.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.920
I'll be back.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.720
Torben? Torben!

42:12.120 --> 42:14.000
This was not part of
the plan.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.720
It's part of it now.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.600
And now?

42:39.680 --> 42:41.320
I'll deal with Torben.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.120
Say you were with him all
weekend.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.800
You wake up Monday, he's gone.

42:50.520 --> 42:54.920
Mikhail Kutuzov used snow and ice to defeat
Napoleon.

42:57.760 --> 43:00.800
Every negative return to
advantage.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.920
Got you.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.680
She's been screwing us the whole
time.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.760
She re ported Torben missing on
Monday morning.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.240
Said he was with her all
weekend.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.280
His watch stopped three days
earlier when he was buried.

43:25.360 --> 43:28.160
Without me there would be no Redback.
Are people aware of that?

43:28.240 --> 43:30.920
What you've achieved, it's really quite
something.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.400
You make delivery. You begin the final phase.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.080
This can't come out before the referendum.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.800
We need to keep this between us.

43:37.880 --> 43:38.920
Just for now.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Give an unhappy woman some hope

43:41.360 --> 43:43.760
and she is yours forever.

43:43.840 --> 43:46.080
<i>But I do think you should come</i>
<i>back.</i>

43:46.160 --> 43:47.800
Please let me finish this.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.960
Then I'll come home. I promise.

43:50.040 --> 43:51.200
Is the building fully secure?

43:51.280 --> 43:53.000
Eight officers standing by.

43:54.440 --> 43:55.560
Footsloggers follow the rules,

43:55.640 --> 43:58.000
so people like
William can do whatever they want.

43:58.080 --> 43:58.920
She killed her partner.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.920
She said she was framed to protect your dad.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.720
Leave Ogilvy to me.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.520
What is Redback?

44:04.600 --> 44:06.920
You're that little Danish spook!

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
If this Redback happens, I will hold you
personally to account.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.160
Just bring Katrine Poulsen in.
Keep her there.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.000
I'm gonna take her apart.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.920
