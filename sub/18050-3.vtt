17:41.693 --> 17:43.562
- Just follow my lead,
and remember,

17:43.629 --> 17:45.831
regular and normal.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.066
Oops.
[giggles]

17:48.133 --> 17:51.170
{\an3}Boo Boo Bear,
what am I doing wrong?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.671
Can you help me?

17:52.738 --> 17:54.706
- But, babe,
you're on the varsity golf--

17:54.773 --> 17:56.141
Ow!
I mean, sure, babe,

17:56.208 --> 17:58.844
I'll help you.
Okay, just square your shoulders

17:58.911 --> 18:01.313
and follow through.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.314
{\an8}- Oops.
- Ow!

18:02.381 --> 18:03.715
What was that for?

18:03.782 --> 18:06.452
- I thought, uh, um, uh,

18:06.518 --> 18:08.053
{\an3}how about
that baseball team

18:08.120 --> 18:10.622
{\an3}that played
the other night?

18:13.492 --> 18:16.595
- Ooh. [chuckles]
Great shot, Boo Boo Bear.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.796
[laughs]

18:17.863 --> 18:18.897
{\an3}- That one's for you,
babe.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.633
- Aw!
[giggles]

18:25.604 --> 18:28.006
{\an1}- Ooh.
Great shot, Rocky Bear.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.675
{\an3}- What?
I totally shanked it.

18:29.741 --> 18:31.844
{\an3}My ball went
down a rain gutter.

18:31.910 --> 18:35.247
- Ha ha. Ha ha.
You're so funny.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.648
{\an3}- Ah!

18:39.885 --> 18:40.853
- Good shot, bro.

18:40.919 --> 18:44.223
{\an3}- Ooh, this hole
is creepy.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.757
Right, Lucy?

18:45.824 --> 18:49.094
{\an3}- Whoa, the Freilich 2000
with crushed velvet interior.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.896
{\an3}I've only seen these
in catalogues.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.865
- Lucy, no, no, no.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.399
[whispering]
Regular and normal.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.802
{\an1}- Ahh!

18:56.869 --> 18:59.137
[strumming guitar]

18:59.204 --> 18:59.972
[door opening]

19:00.038 --> 19:01.306
[all talking at once]

19:01.373 --> 19:02.508
- Tell me everything!
Tell me everything!

19:02.574 --> 19:03.775
- Are you totes in love?

19:03.842 --> 19:06.111
- No, we are totes not.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.279
- Lucy, wait.

19:07.346 --> 19:08.780
{\an3}We're sorry we pushed you
so hard.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.182
all: Sorry.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.050
{\an3}- We got a little too excited
when you said

19:12.117 --> 19:14.820
{\an3}you wanted to be normal
and regular, like us.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.689
{\an3}But you're not those things.
You're Lucy Loud.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.591
{\an3}You're perfect
just the way you are,

19:19.658 --> 19:21.226
and <i> we</i> love you.

19:21.293 --> 19:24.029
{\an1}- Sigh.
There's no need to apologize.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.831
{\an1}I know you were
just trying to help,

19:25.898 --> 19:28.600
{\an1}and I thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.302
I'm going to go
sit in the dark.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.004
That always cheers me up.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.672
- Well, lesson learned.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.240
{\an3}You can take the girl
out the coffin,

19:35.307 --> 19:37.442
{\an3}but you can't take the coffin
out of the girl.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.046
{\an1}- Well, Edwin.
Rocky doesn't like me as myself.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.715
{\an1}He doesn't like me
as a regular, normal girl.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.385
{\an1}He just doesn't like me.
Sigh.

19:46.451 --> 19:50.155
I was a fool to think it could
ever work with a mortal being.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.491
- Poor kid.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.626
- Fangs, bedtime.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.028
- Ah!

19:56.094 --> 19:57.329
Dang it.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.531
{\an3}There we go.
Now, as long as we keep it

19:59.598 --> 20:02.334
{\an3}far away from your house,
we should be done.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.305
{\an1}Ah!
Rocky! You're bleeding!

20:06.371 --> 20:07.739
{\an1}[screams]

20:07.806 --> 20:10.609
{\an3}- Don't worry, man.
Rusty faints all the time.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.144
{\an1}- Yeah, but are you
all right?

20:12.210 --> 20:14.446
{\an3}- Oh, yeah, this is
fake blood.

20:14.513 --> 20:15.948
{\an1}- Why would you have
fake blood?

20:16.014 --> 20:18.283
{\an3}- I saw Lucy making it
at your house

20:18.350 --> 20:22.187
{\an3}and it seemed kinda cool,
so I thought I'd give it a try.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.388
{\an3}Anyway--

20:25.257 --> 20:26.391
{\an1}- Oops.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.693
- Wha--what happened?

20:27.759 --> 20:30.696
{\an1}- Uh, you fainted and
broke our solar system.

20:30.762 --> 20:31.997
{\an3}- Aw, man!

20:32.064 --> 20:34.433
{\an1}- That's okay.
We can fix it at my house.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.867
I have an extra Jupiter.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.169
- Your house?

20:37.235 --> 20:39.838
{\an1}- Well, our project isn't
any safer here.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.106
- I guess you're right.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.041
{\an3}Come on, Rock,
let's roll!

20:44.409 --> 20:47.179
- Done.
Form a protective perimeter.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.518
{\an3}- Hey, Rocky, grab us some sodas
from the kitchen, will ya?

20:56.655 --> 20:58.991
{\an3}- Ah.
Oh. Hi.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.693
{\an1}- Uh, hi.
You changed your hair back.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.895
Yeah, the blonde
wasn't really me.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.264
I was trying to be
regular and normal,

21:06.331 --> 21:08.300
{\an3}but I think I'm just
gonna be myself.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.736
{\an1}- I'm really glad
to hear that.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.838
{\an3}- Thanks.
Well, see you later.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.173
Wait, you are?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.943
But when we first met,
you kept running away.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.012
{\an3}I thought
I freaked you out.

21:20.078 --> 21:22.180
- To be honest, I thought
you were too cool for me,

21:22.247 --> 21:24.750
and I couldn't think
of anything to say,

21:24.816 --> 21:26.852
so I just ran.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.255
{\an3}- Hey, uh,
my coffin collection's

21:30.322 --> 21:32.557
{\an3}in the basement.
Wanna check it out?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.059
{\an1}- Sure.
That'd be really fun.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.894
As long as I don't
have to get in one.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.829
{\an3}- Deal.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.501
{\an3}- Can we stop?
I'm feeling faint.

21:43.568 --> 21:44.536
{\an3}Easy.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.271
{\an3}Ah!
Watch the pothole!

21:46.338 --> 21:49.007
{\an1}- It's okay, Rusty.
We spent all weekend on this,

21:49.074 --> 21:50.542
we're not gonna
drop it now.

21:50.609 --> 21:51.943
both: Hey, guys.
both: Ah!

21:52.978 --> 21:55.047
{\an3}- Phew!
Good save, man.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.581
- Sorry we scared you.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.351
{\an1}- We just wanted to tell you
we nailed the fake blood recipe.

21:59.418 --> 22:01.720
{\an3}- We also threw in
a few popcorn kernels

22:01.787 --> 22:03.689
for brain matter.

22:03.755 --> 22:04.690
{\an3}- Ah!

22:04.756 --> 22:06.091
{\an1}- Dang it.
