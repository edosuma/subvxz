WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.218
So, you want to be a secretary
for a talent manager.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.762
- Yes. Very much.
- Great.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.765
You're up.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.726
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead. I'm all ears.

00:16.726 --> 00:19.729
Oh. Well,
what would you like to know?

00:20.813 --> 00:22.732
Give me a minute.

00:28.988 --> 00:32.450
Do you have a natural flair
for meticulous organization?

00:32.450 --> 00:33.868
I'd say yes. Yes, I do.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.953
Great.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.916
You excuse me again?

00:46.881 --> 00:49.800
Can you always be depended upon
to do what you say you'll do?

00:49.884 --> 00:52.052
- Yes, certainly.
- Fantastic.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.848
Perhaps you'd like
to see my résumé?

00:55.848 --> 00:58.476
Excellent, yes,
let's take a gander.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.478
Three pages, huh?

01:00.478 --> 01:01.645
Mm-hmm.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.064
Come on. Some of this is
bullshit, right?

01:04.148 --> 01:05.483
Then I went
to Brooklyn College,

01:05.483 --> 01:06.942
where I got my B.A.
in English literature.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.611
Very good.

01:08.611 --> 01:11.530
And... why do you want
to work here?

01:11.614 --> 01:13.491
Many reasons. But first
and foremost, I'm excited

01:13.616 --> 01:15.367
to get in on the ground floor
of a growing business.

01:15.451 --> 01:16.911
Growing business.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.914
Okay, that's putting
a shit-ton of pressure on me.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.082
Do you have any questions
you'd like to ask me?

01:22.166 --> 01:24.627
Um, what will
a typical workday look like?

01:24.627 --> 01:28.088
Will you excuse me a minute?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.591
Every one of these broads,
they can type,

01:30.591 --> 01:33.844
they graduated from someplace,
they sit nice.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.388
I got this book with questions
to ask. It's no fucking help.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.973
All the girls give
the same answer,

01:38.057 --> 01:39.934
because they all probably got
a fucking book, too.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.393
You ever hire anybody?

01:41.477 --> 01:42.728
Sure, lots of people. <i>- Well, what kind of stuff</i>

01:42.812 --> 01:44.021
<i>do you ask,
so you know who to pick?</i>

01:44.021 --> 01:45.940
That depends.
You got to tailor the questions

01:45.940 --> 01:47.107
to the specific job.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.400
Yeah. How, Fred? How?

01:48.484 --> 01:50.402
Well, when I hired a guy
to paint my apartment,

01:50.486 --> 01:52.655
I asked if he had a ten-foot ladder. <i>- Okay.</i>

01:52.655 --> 01:54.949
But I didn't ask that
when I hired my tax guy

01:54.949 --> 01:57.201
<i>or the girl to get my brother
laid after his divorce.</i>

01:57.201 --> 01:58.869
<i>You don't need a ladder
for those jobs.</i>

01:58.953 --> 02:01.497
Fred, did you ever hire anybody
at William Morris

02:01.497 --> 02:03.916
in a professional,
show-business capacity?

02:03.916 --> 02:05.000
Not per se.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.252
I'm hanging up. <i>- Wait.</i>

02:06.252 --> 02:08.546
You should definitely see
how the person chews.

02:08.546 --> 02:10.172
<i>- What?</i>
- I'm serious.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.132
You're going to be in
close quarters with this girl,

02:12.216 --> 02:15.052
with snacks and whatnot,
munching and crunching,

02:15.052 --> 02:16.262
<i>day in, day out.</i>

02:16.262 --> 02:19.014
<i>If they chew loud,
you're doomed.</i>

02:19.098 --> 02:21.141
My shorthand is excellent,
and I type 70 words per minute.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.185
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm friendly but I'm firm.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.229
Your time is precious,
and I'll be the gatekeeper.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.273
There will be
no unwarranted interruptions.

02:27.273 --> 02:28.899
Yes, that is all
very interesting.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.359
Very interesting.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.319
Hey, you hungry?

02:32.403 --> 02:34.613
- Uh, no, not really.
- 'Cause I was about to eat this, but now...

02:34.697 --> 02:35.865
why don't you have it?

02:35.865 --> 02:37.449
Thank you, no, I just had lunch.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.909
I'll cut it up for you.
I got a pocketknife.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.244
That's very nice,
but really, no.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.620
Oh, come on,
it's nice and crispy.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.163
To be honest,
I'm actually allergic...

02:43.247 --> 02:44.748
Eat the fucking apple!

03:09.273 --> 03:10.983
- Papa, are you up?
- Who is it?

03:10.983 --> 03:12.318
It's me, Abe.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.153
It's not you.

03:14.153 --> 03:17.698
- Stop that, please.
- It's not me.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.074
Did I wake you?

03:19.158 --> 03:20.951
Sorry,
I figured you'd be reading.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.953
Your mother made me
turn out my light.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.371
Now, what is it?

03:24.455 --> 03:26.457
I need some help,
but I'll ask you tomorrow.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.083
No, it's fine.
I was just lying there

03:28.167 --> 03:30.127
thinking about how she made me
turn out my light.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.171
I just can't get my checkbook
to balance,

03:32.171 --> 03:34.423
- and it's driving me crazy.
- What's going on?

03:34.423 --> 03:36.175
Nothing. Miriam can't balance
her checkbook.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.135
Why on earth
would you have her doing that

03:38.135 --> 03:40.512
- in the middle of the night, Abe?
- I live in a Dr. Seuss book.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.348
I'm sorry I got you up.
Back to bed, you two.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.433
- Night night.
- I can't sleep when your father's just lying there

03:44.433 --> 03:46.393
thinking about how I made him
turn out the light.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.687
- Then let me turn on my light.
- Fine, I'll sleep on the couch.

03:48.771 --> 03:51.148
Do not sleep on the couch.
It wears out the cushions faster

03:51.148 --> 03:55.319
- than just everyday sitting.
- Then I'm going back to bed.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.279
Where's the checkbook?

03:57.363 --> 03:58.822
In the kitchen.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.866
It's been weeks.
You have to stop fighting.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.826
Who's fighting?
I'm simply recalibrating

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
my entire relationship
with your mother

04:04.912 --> 04:07.164
based on information she
previously chose to keep secret

04:07.164 --> 04:08.582
for 35 years.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.210
Okay. Could you stop that, then?

04:11.210 --> 04:13.212
It comes out different
every time.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.673
- Always terrible but never the same.
- Ugh.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.133
What's this?

04:18.217 --> 04:20.177
Is it better if it's a one
or a seven?

04:20.177 --> 04:22.054
It's less bad if it's a seven.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.722
Call it a seven.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.766
And this is
what you're getting paid

04:25.766 --> 04:27.893
for selling
all that Tupperware?

04:27.977 --> 04:30.270
It's no way to get rich,
but I did win an aquarium.

04:30.354 --> 04:33.065
Which has been surprisingly
expensive to maintain.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.276
I sold the most pastel
Wonderliers in my region.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.446
- Mm-hmm.
- I also won those toasters and a salad spinner.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.365
And surely you've seen
the two large dalmatians

04:41.365 --> 04:42.866
in our living room.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.996
Do you think Joel could try
to contribute a little more?

04:46.996 --> 04:49.456
He's doing
everything he can, Papa.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.708
Well...

04:51.792 --> 04:53.627
There's your balance.

04:53.711 --> 04:56.046
Uh, that's if the number was
a seven.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.632
And that's if it was a one.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.218
I think even Ethan
could have helped you.

05:01.218 --> 05:05.055
Thanks, Papa. Really.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.725
Could I bring my book in here
and read?

05:07.725 --> 05:09.476
Sure.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.104
I'll forgive your mother
in the morning.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.982
For God's sake, the woman owns
a Chanel sleep mask.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.290
Looks like it's gonna be
four debates.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.708
Kennedy-Nixon?

05:32.708 --> 05:34.251
- He's such a creep.
- Which one?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.295
Nixon. Mei.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.629
They both have skeletons.

05:37.713 --> 05:38.797
You are not voting for Nixon.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.507
I am not voting for Nixon.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.884
He looks like he eats children.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.093
Thank you.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.386
Ethan wants

05:44.470 --> 05:46.221
one of these
Etch A Sketch things,

05:46.305 --> 05:48.682
but they're $2.99, and he'll
break it in, like, a day.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.184
What's an Etch A Sketch?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.935
You draw on the screen with the knobs,

05:52.019 --> 05:54.897
- then you shake it, and the picture erases.
- What's the point of that?

05:54.897 --> 05:57.608
To teach kids that nothing lasts.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.942
- Joel!
- What?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.611
You're not even gonna answer
the door?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.071
- Nah.
- Come on!

06:02.071 --> 06:03.697
We discussed this.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.574
It could be another one
of Ma's girls.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.660
- If I open it, I'm as good as engaged.
- It could be a delivery.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.037
- They'll leave it.
- Someone could steal it.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.288
Nothing lasts.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.289
What do you do at the club?

06:12.289 --> 06:13.457
- Shh.
- Why?

06:13.457 --> 06:15.084
In case they're listening
at the door.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.294
If the phone rings at the club,
you have to answer it.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.338
People want to come in,
you have to let them in.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.423
There's a protocol for women
of childbearing age.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.634
If they want to talk to me,
Mrs. Moskowitz screens them

06:23.634 --> 06:25.219
with a series
of discreet questions.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.221
- Oh, my God.
- The system's worked for weeks.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.264
- Why question it now?
- Because it's demented.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.891
Because it's...

06:30.891 --> 06:32.601
Aah! I'll do it!

06:32.601 --> 06:34.269
- Do what?
- I'll meet your parents.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.479
Just answer the phone!

06:35.479 --> 06:37.940
- No. We can wait my mother out.
- We can't.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.359
We can. She's getting older.
She has limited wind.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.860
We need our lives back, Joel.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.904
- My life is fine.
- Well, mine isn't.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.489
This is dumb.
I mean, you said it.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.033
We're in a... a...

06:48.117 --> 06:49.868
Relationship.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.245
Yes. That. Sure.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.663
They have to know.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.749
Make a date. End the madness.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.917
I'll just move again.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.752
A moving target
will confuse her.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.092
Set it up. Today.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.136
I'll be at the movies.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.099
Just in case.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.232
Susie? Oh. Sorry.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.109
I just need to talk to you
when you're done.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.902
- No, now's a good time.
- Should I wait outside?

07:23.986 --> 07:25.529
Nah. You ain't getting the job.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.865
- Oh. Okay, thank you.
- No. Thank you.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.660
- What's with your phone?
- Nothing. Why?

07:31.660 --> 07:34.705
- I've been calling all morning. All you get is a busy signal.
- Shit.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.915
You need a secretary.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.083
What do you think that was?

07:38.167 --> 07:39.877
What's up?

07:39.877 --> 07:41.587
- This.
- What is that?

07:41.587 --> 07:45.382
This is my invitation
to Shy Baldwin's wedding.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.967
Why the fuck
would you be invited

07:46.967 --> 07:49.094
- to Shy Baldwin's wedding?
- You tell me.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.971
I don't know.
They're working off an old list?

07:50.971 --> 07:54.391
- Then you would've been invited.
- And I was not invited.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.019
- Susie.
- I guess I was invited.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.271
Why the hell was I invited
to Shy Baldwin's wedding?

07:59.271 --> 08:01.315
And it's three days from now.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.900
Basic wedding etiquette dictates
invitations go out

08:02.900 --> 08:05.068
45 days prior to the event,
at a minimum.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.486
I'm sorry, you're offended
that you were invited

08:06.570 --> 08:08.697
at the last minute to a
wedding you don't want to go to?

08:08.697 --> 08:09.698
Yes. Who wouldn't be?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.450
- Me.
- And not only am I not going,

08:11.450 --> 08:13.243
I'm RSVPing "yes"
and then not going,

08:13.327 --> 08:14.703
just to screw up his count.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.996
You're a monster.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.165
That thing's a waste
of a nice gilded edge.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.709
You know what?
Maybe we should go.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.712
- Go? Are you kidding me?
- There's no way

08:23.712 --> 08:25.505
there's not an open bar,
some good food.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.924
You are not serious.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.217
He kind of owes us, you know?

08:28.217 --> 08:29.426
You could get
your picture taken there,

08:29.426 --> 08:31.803
get some good exposure
and some good cake.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.556
I am kind of curious to see
the whole spectacle.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.559
And I am really curious
to drink a lot of free booze.

08:39.603 --> 08:40.812
Did you see that?

08:40.896 --> 08:42.481
- See what?
- So you didn't?
- The smoke?

08:42.481 --> 08:44.233
- So you did.
- I did.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.235
- Damn. Damn it.
- Were we not supposed to?

08:46.235 --> 08:48.320
Of course you were,
but not then. Later.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.989
It's no good! I can't...

08:51.073 --> 08:52.532
What was I...
How am I supposed...

08:52.616 --> 08:54.076
Breathe it out.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.954
It was on four, not three.
Just have to remember to count.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.331
I'll just try it again.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.462
I'm looking pretty good to you
right now, aren't I?

09:08.507 --> 09:12.427
I got a net.
I should save for Ethan?

09:12.511 --> 09:14.179
We have saying back home:

09:14.263 --> 09:17.724
"Never too early for child
to learn how to bury."

09:17.808 --> 09:21.812
Mm. Let's just flush him and let
his memory be a blessing.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.439
Do we have any matches, Zelda?
This is dangerous.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.567
I saw Miss Miriam has matches
in her bedroom. I'll get them.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.988
I'll get it, Zelda.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.493
Weissman residence.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.620
Mm, this is she.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.125
Well, of course.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.502
I'd be very happy to meet
with Mr. Melamid.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.298
Certainly, any time he'd like.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.591
Today's fine.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.469
Half an hour.
I can be ready by then.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.347
It's 385 Riverside Drive
in Manhattan.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.640
Thank you so much.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.517
You're welcome. Thank you.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.977
<i>Goodbye.</i>

10:04.271 --> 10:06.690
As it turns out, I don't have
time for tea after all.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.608
There's a car coming for me.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.610
I have business in Scarsdale.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.946
Please tell Mr. Weissman
when he comes home.

10:13.030 --> 10:16.658
Okay, I'll tell him you went
outside to do your business.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.828
I'll just leave a note.

10:21.747 --> 10:25.375

10:44.311 --> 10:46.396
I'd, uh, shake your hand,
but mine is...

10:46.480 --> 10:48.690
straight from the horse's mouth, shall we say.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.359
- Anyway, welcome.
- Rose Weissman.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.735
It's a pleasure.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.278
Cut it out, Zephaniah.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.905
Don't let him scare you.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.115
Oh, it takes more than
a little showing off to do that.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.701
I grew up with horses.
In Oklahoma.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.953
- And I see you wore sensible shoes.
- Well, there's nothing elegant

11:02.037 --> 11:04.456
about landing on your backside
in the mud, is there?

11:04.456 --> 11:06.625
I can tell,
you know a thing or two.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.043
Join me in a walk?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.753
Now, that...

11:09.753 --> 11:10.837
Whoa, boy!

11:10.921 --> 11:13.715
...is Copper Jack,
my prize stallion.

11:13.799 --> 11:17.094
A stable boy walked a mare
past his stall this morning.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.179
Poor devil got a whiff,
and he hasn't been able

11:19.179 --> 11:21.890
- to calm himself since.
- Hmm. Your house, my goodness,

11:21.890 --> 11:24.976
it's even more stunning than
it looked in <i>Town & Country.</i>

11:25.060 --> 11:27.229
My great-grandfather
had it built in 1840.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.398
We throw on another wing
from time to time--

11:29.398 --> 11:31.066
birthdays, Hanukkah.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.068
Hmm, your family's
in the railroad business.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.071
Railroad, shipping, steel.
We're eyeing aviation.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.532
Innovation's key.
Stagnation is death.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.534
You're a businesswoman;
you know all this.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.786
Oh, yes, I am. I do.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.621
Mrs. Weissman,
I wanted to meet you,

11:44.621 --> 11:48.041
because your impressive match
for my lawyer's daughter

11:48.125 --> 11:49.876
did not escape my notice.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.711
Norma and Lorraine,
my two daughters,

11:51.795 --> 11:54.047
are 31 and 32 years old.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.132
Oh!

11:55.132 --> 11:57.175
- Uh, sorry.
- No, don't be.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.177
Their mother cries herself
to sleep every night

11:59.261 --> 12:00.887
wondering where she went wrong.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.806
Well, you've come
to the right place.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.641
Trees with a few more rings
on them

12:04.641 --> 12:06.601
happen to be
a specialty of mine.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.686
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.854
That's good to hear.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.815
I think we're gonna have
to give him Starlight

12:11.815 --> 12:13.233
just to calm him down.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.444
Horses are easy.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.237
You throw them together,
a little noise,

12:17.237 --> 12:20.490
maybe a stall door needs
repairing, and that's that.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.701
If only it were as simple
with daughters.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.495
- Tell me about them, your girls.
- Well...

12:25.579 --> 12:27.497
Norma has a penchant
for stable boys.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.708
- She's the Starlight of the family.
- I see.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.835
Lorraine, the younger one,
she got kicked in the head

12:31.835 --> 12:34.254
by a horse as a child,
so she's an easy mark.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.715
We've had a lot of schemers
and gigolos who look at Lorraine

12:36.715 --> 12:38.884
and see the goose that laid
the golden egg.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.428
- She almost married an actor.
- Heavens.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.973
I got him a job on the road
promoting Ford Thunderbirds.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.142
He's in Alaska as we speak.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.436
But they aren't all
so easily disposed of.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.480
You just need someone
to screen out the schemers

12:51.480 --> 12:53.482
and find the man
who will love Lorraine

12:53.482 --> 12:55.609
for who she is
and not what she has.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.819
And I need to be able
to bring my daughters' husbands

12:57.903 --> 12:59.988
into the family business.
They can't be idiots,

12:59.988 --> 13:02.574
- or obvious idiots.
- Well, Mr. Melamid,

13:02.574 --> 13:04.868
I assure you I can find
some very nice men

13:04.868 --> 13:06.536
who are not obviously idiots

13:06.620 --> 13:08.997
and will make Norma and Lorraine
very happy.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.207
Oh, yes.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.125
Happy, that would be good, too.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.503
Not a deal breaker,
but a nice bonus.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.630
Mrs. Weissman,
I am appointing you

13:16.630 --> 13:20.175
director of the nearly bankrupt
division of Melamid Industries

13:20.175 --> 13:22.552
known as my daughters'
marital prospects.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.596
Good luck.
And if it's any incentive,

13:24.596 --> 13:28.391
the extended Melamid family
is large, rich and homely,

13:28.475 --> 13:31.436
so there could be a lot of
Melamid matches in your future.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.438
Well, then I'd better get
right to work.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.565
Where are
Norma and Lorraine now?

13:35.649 --> 13:36.733
In the city.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.443
They live together there
like a pair of ex-nuns.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.654
I'll set up meetings right away
to get to know them.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.281
Please tell Mrs. Melamid
I said she should start thinking

13:43.365 --> 13:44.741
about the centerpieces.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.159
One more thing.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.161
Respectability is
of the utmost importance

13:48.245 --> 13:49.496
to the Melamid family.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.707
We value decency,
dignity and discretion,

13:52.791 --> 13:55.877
and we assume you
and your family do as well.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.547
- Yes, of course, Mr. Melamid.
- Good.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.465
Call me Solomon.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.841
John!

14:01.925 --> 14:04.594
Send Edgar to give
Mrs. Weissman a tour.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.221
Make sure you see the swans.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.848
They are bastards
but they are beautiful.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.567
Hello?

14:18.567 --> 14:20.694
Is anybody home?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.530
Miriam?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.615
Ice cream,
get your ice cream here.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.452

I got vanilla.

- It's my chauffeur. He fired himself.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.388
I had to take a cab.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.349
- Okay, so...
- Did you hear what I said?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.184
A taxicab.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.562
Susie... I'm exhausted.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.022
I had to hail it myself.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.107
I had to put my arm
up in the air,

15:41.191 --> 15:44.444
I had to leave it there
until the cab pulled over.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.280
I had to open my own door.
I had to duck down...

15:47.364 --> 15:49.324
It sounds harrowing,
but it's over. Now focus.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.742
- Mm.
- Look over there.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.953
That is Mike Carr.
He books <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

15:54.037 --> 15:56.164
Hmm, not unattractive.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.458
You are not gonna fuck him.
You're gonna meet with him.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.502
Now, I got to make sure
you are ready for this.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.337
Let me see your eyes.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.255
Well, at least they're spinning
in the same direction.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.257
Did you take your meds,
or stop taking them,

16:06.341 --> 16:09.177
- whichever makes you less nuts?
- Yes, both.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.429
Because if you screw this up,
all that's left for you

16:11.513 --> 16:14.641
is to be my secretary,
and you'd be a lousy secretary.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.142

16:21.064 --> 16:22.941

16:22.941 --> 16:24.859
Finally. I was about to leave.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.528
You would've missed out
on the meeting of a lifetime.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.155
When I went to a bullfight
with Hemingway,

16:29.239 --> 16:30.949
that was the meeting
of a lifetime.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.617
I don't know what the fuck
this is.

16:32.701 --> 16:35.120
Then, let me introduce you
to the goddamn living legend,

16:35.120 --> 16:36.913
Sophie Lennon. Sophie, Mike.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.081
I started out with
ten minutes for you.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.874
I waited seven,
so now I have three.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.960
- I like him.
- Great. Sit.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.797
Ooh!

16:45.797 --> 16:47.006
You okay?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.175
Have you ever taken a cab?

16:49.259 --> 16:50.719
Ignore her.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.512
Mike, when's your birthday?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.764
Day before Christmas.
It's a fucking curse.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.141
How would you like it
to be next week?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.600
What's the angle here?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.310
I thought you said no sex.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.479
What I am offering you
today is a gift.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.274
An unprecedented interview
with the great Sophie Lennon.

17:04.274 --> 17:05.775
Unprecedented?

17:05.859 --> 17:07.652
She's been on every goddamn
talk show in the country.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.696
I have. I've been
on <i>Sullivan</i> nine times.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.656
Yeah, I heard about
you being "on Sullivan."

17:11.740 --> 17:13.450
He said he was leaving his wife.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.201
I am not talking about some
run-of-the-mill interview.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.578
Is that what you think
Gordon does?

17:16.578 --> 17:18.121
Run-of-the-mill interviews?

17:18.121 --> 17:20.957
- Mike.
- Keep walking.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.834
- Mike, listen...
- There's no heat on her.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.003
Okay? It'd be like booking
an iceberg, sorry.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.338
- And I accept your apology.
- Don't talk.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.216
Mike, just listen to me.
This woman here,

17:30.300 --> 17:31.843
she had a nervous breakdown.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.386
- That's your pitch?
- She went from being

17:33.470 --> 17:35.263
the highest-paid comedian
in this business

17:35.263 --> 17:37.474
to a punch line herself
in one fucking night.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.975
Complete career suicide.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.602
You telling me that story
doesn't interest you?

17:40.602 --> 17:42.937
Well, sure, but we can't talk
about that shit on the show.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.522
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.857
Who says?

17:45.857 --> 17:48.276
I don't know, uh... America?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.861
Fuck America.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.696
You book Sophie on that show,
she will give Gordon

17:51.780 --> 17:53.490
the kind of interview
no other star

17:53.490 --> 17:55.283
in her right mind
would ever agree to.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.243
I am not in my right mind,
that is true.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.537
- She's got stories, Mike.
- So?

17:59.621 --> 18:01.748
My mother has stories.
I wouldn't book her, either.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.125
Who'd you have
on the show last night, Mike?

18:04.209 --> 18:06.586
Let me answer that--
a blonde starlet

18:06.586 --> 18:08.379
and a boring-ass director.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.048
The night before that,
a red-headed starlet

18:10.048 --> 18:11.716
and a boring-ass novelist.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.635
And they're all
plugging something.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.887
They talk about their shitty
movie or their boring book,

18:15.887 --> 18:18.264
how everyone they work with
is a genius

18:18.348 --> 18:20.517
and how everybody in Hollywood
is best friends.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.811
And maybe they throw in
a semi-embarrassing story

18:22.811 --> 18:24.604
about getting locked
out of their house,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.272
wearing only a towel,
then you go

18:26.356 --> 18:27.774
to a commercial,
sell some cigarettes.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.109
Well, Sophie Lennon has
fuck-all to plug.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.986
She's got nothing to lose.

18:32.070 --> 18:35.406
So she is gonna open up
her walk-in closet of skeletons

18:35.490 --> 18:38.660
and introduce them all
to the world in living color.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.078
And her publicist
isn't gonna stop her

18:40.078 --> 18:41.579
'cause her publicist
quit last week.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.915
It's risky.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.792
If it's a disaster,
I'm the one that goes down.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.169
Gordon's been stuck at
number two since the beginning.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.380
He does something ballsy
like this?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.173
He's number one
and you're the one

18:52.257 --> 18:53.842
who made him number one.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.677
If it doesn't work, sure,
it's your ass.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.388
But if he stays number two,
aren't you getting fired anyway?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.307
Give me a card.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.184
Got one right here.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.562
Uh, wait, I got a...
new number.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.316
And the printer fucked up.
There's no "Q" in "Myerson."

19:10.400 --> 19:12.402
Stay by your phone.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.865
Did that go well or badly?

19:16.865 --> 19:19.325
I do not think you're gonna need
to be my secretary.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.111
What would you like to drink?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.030
Very cold water, please.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.865
You get water,
I still have to charge you.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.658
And there's a two-drink minimum.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.369
Water... and two sherries.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.778
Bubble, bubble,

20:36.778 --> 20:39.364
toil and trouble.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.199
Ooh!

20:41.199 --> 20:43.534
Everyone nice
and lubricated out there?

20:45.620 --> 20:46.871
How you doing
in the cheap seats?

20:46.955 --> 20:48.456
- All right!
- All right.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.750
Now I just want you
to think about something.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.418
Especially you with your hand

20:52.502 --> 20:54.671
precariously close
to your crotch there.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.966
Every girl
you see working tonight,

20:57.966 --> 21:00.635
shaking their moneymakers...

21:00.635 --> 21:03.388
has a father.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.264
That's right, me, too.
I have a father.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.683
Goes by Abraham.

21:06.683 --> 21:09.268
He thought I'd grow up
to be the perfect lady.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.604
And here I am,
slinging dick jokes

21:11.688 --> 21:13.272
in a strip club
to a bunch of drunk men

21:13.356 --> 21:14.816
with various degrees
of syphilis.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.442
So happy Father's Day!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.335
You're home late.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.671
- You're up late.
- Where have you been?

21:36.671 --> 21:38.548
We went out to get
something to eat after work.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.216
- We?
- Me and Susie.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.968
Oh, so no boyfriend.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.344
Well, if you squint.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.430
Late-night dining sounds
very glamorous.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.016
I ate my grilled cheese
with my pinkie up.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.392
Where are you going?

21:49.392 --> 21:50.935
You're certainly not gonna
eat again, are you?

21:51.019 --> 21:52.186
You'll lose your figure.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.479
Then you'll never get
a boyfriend.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.233
I already have a shadow, Mama.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.194
There's something
I need to discuss with you.

22:00.278 --> 22:01.946
Something
that can't wait till morning?

22:02.030 --> 22:03.322
I'm exhausted.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.491
It's 5:00 a.m. It is morning.

22:05.575 --> 22:06.993
This is me

22:06.993 --> 22:08.745
falling asleep on the counter.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.329
I have a new matchmaking client.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.458
Solomon Melamid,
of the Melamids.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.793
- Are you listening?
- Uh-huh, Mallomars.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.420
Melamids.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.131
Miriam, wake up.
This is important.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.508
He has two unmarried daughters
and he's richer than God.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.469
Sounds great.
Mallomars sound better, but...

22:24.469 --> 22:26.554
He's a very important man.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.473
- He's very concerned about discretion.
- Uh-huh.

22:28.473 --> 22:31.142
And I have promised him that
I am nothing if not discreet.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.603
- I will do nothing to embarrass him.
- Uh-huh.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.063
I won't.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.647
However...

22:38.441 --> 22:40.443
What?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.951
I'm thinking things are
gonna get a little loud.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.953
I don't want to wake the kids.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.209
You were saying?

22:56.209 --> 22:57.919
Your career thing.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.670
- Yep.
- It's a problem.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.255
Mallomars don't like jokes?

23:01.339 --> 23:03.800
Well, they don't like
strip clubs.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.094
You've been hiding it from us,
so you must understand

23:06.094 --> 23:07.720
- where they're coming from.
- Where'd you get that?

23:07.804 --> 23:09.055
Your room. It's full of them.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.515
You're snooping in my room,

23:10.515 --> 23:12.058
like I'm 15?

23:12.058 --> 23:14.185
No, you didn't lie and sneak
around when you were 15.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.853
I never lied about the club.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.438
I just didn't tell you
the details.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.065
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.942
A rubber girdle
is uncomfortable.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.985
Stumbling onto a box
of newspaper clippings

23:23.069 --> 23:24.570
linking your daughter
to a strip club

23:24.654 --> 23:26.322
for all the world to see
is excruciating!

23:26.322 --> 23:29.492
It's pretty hard to stumble onto
a locked box in a closed drawer.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.077
So you were hiding it.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.745
No. I wasn't hiding my box

23:32.829 --> 23:35.123
of my clippings in my apartment.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.207
You mean the apartment
your father

23:36.207 --> 23:37.208
and I bought back for you.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.292
That's your cover story

23:38.376 --> 23:39.293
for something you're hiding.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.419
Well, it's not a cover story

23:40.503 --> 23:41.838
if you don't use it consistently.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.631
Yes, I am working
at a strip club.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.008
- So you're a stripper?
- No, I am a comic.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.386
Solomon Melamid will think
you are a stripper.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.304
Well, then he'll be
very disappointed by my act.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.681
Miriam, hear me.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.808
There are dozens
of rich, homely girls

23:53.808 --> 23:55.434
in the Melamid clan.

23:55.518 --> 23:58.146
And all four of Solomon
Melamid's sisters are widows.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.189
Suspicious? Fine. I don't care.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.983
This large, sad family is
a cash cow,

24:01.983 --> 24:03.317
and I want to milk it.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.403
Who's stopping you? Grab a pail.

24:05.403 --> 24:06.946
I can't because my daughter's
a stripper.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.574
Are we really
gonna do this again?

24:09.574 --> 24:11.659
What else do I call a woman
who performs at a strip club?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.494
An emcee, a comic,

24:13.578 --> 24:15.371
a jokester, a card,

24:15.371 --> 24:16.998
a gagster, a wag, a wit...

24:16.998 --> 24:19.083
Would you go to a dentist whose
office was in a whorehouse?

24:19.167 --> 24:21.002
Okay, the sun is coming up

24:21.002 --> 24:22.795
and I have to talk to Ethan's
teacher at 8:00 about the odds

24:22.879 --> 24:24.338
of him getting out of
kindergarten on the first try,

24:24.422 --> 24:25.923
so let's wrap this up.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.425
What do you want me
to do here, Mama?

24:27.425 --> 24:30.595
- Quit.
- No. I am a comedian.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.013
Well, comedian somewhere else.

24:32.013 --> 24:34.098
The Wolford pays me.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.018
It's regular money and
I can do my act the way I want.

24:37.018 --> 24:38.477
Why not just go back
to the Gashole?

24:38.561 --> 24:40.563
The Gaslight.
That's a basket house.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.273
There's no money there.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.442
I don't see how Mallomar's
even gonna find out about this.

24:44.442 --> 24:45.610
He'll read about you
in the paper.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.778
I doubt he reads L. Roy Dunham.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.238
Mr. Melamid reads everything.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.532
Well, even if he does,
we have different names.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.577
- Weissman, Maisel.
- L. Roy Dunham is a journalist.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.579
He will track down your identity
and he will eventually print it.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.664
Well, que será, será.

24:58.748 --> 25:01.250
Miriam, my job is
very important to me.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.628
I could be on the verge
of something very big here.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.131
Me, too.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.379
Shit.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.756
Yeah. It's fucking fabulous.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.270
Here.

26:02.270 --> 26:05.439
You kind of fucked up
the floral arrangement there.

26:08.693 --> 26:11.821
There,
now it's truly fucked up.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.447
We're off to a productive start.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.533
- Bar?
- Bar.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.958
What can I get
for you?

26:23.958 --> 26:25.793
What's
your most expensive Scotch?

26:25.793 --> 26:27.503
I think that would be
the Balvenie 30, sir.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.714
That one. Uh, make it a double.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.133
A triple.
Hey, what's your top shelf gin?

26:32.133 --> 26:34.051
- Throw some of that in there, too.
- I'll have the same.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.178
- But with a cherry.
- Your most expensive cherry.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.306
Two cherries, please.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.106
Let's do some business.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.109
Hello, boys.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.236
Mrs. Maisel, Miriam,
hot rising comic.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.071
Get in there, honey.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.865
- Oh, she is something, huh?
- Smile.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.074
Looks good
in a bathing suit, too.

26:57.158 --> 26:59.618
Boy! Legs and tits for days!

26:59.702 --> 27:01.037
- Okay, got it.
- Good?

27:01.037 --> 27:03.414
You got it? Okay.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.916
Uh, Susie Myerson and Associates
is her representation.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.960
Well, that was sufficiently
gross and demeaning.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.129
- You're welcome.
- Interesting combination.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.298
What are they called?

27:12.298 --> 27:14.258
Sweet Revenge.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.555
Whoa!

27:19.555 --> 27:21.724
This is definitely gonna
make me throw up.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.559
Do it on the dance floor.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.811
- Canapé?
- I can indeed.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.688
Great portions here.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.273
Eh, 20 bucks right there.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.941
- Heads up.
- Ooh!

27:31.025 --> 27:32.068
- Oh, my God.
- Hmm?

27:32.068 --> 27:33.986
Susie, it's Sidney Poitier.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.238
- What? Where?
- There, front table.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.783
Wow, and he's talking
to, uh, Harvey.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.868
- From the movie.
- Harvey was the rabbit.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.620
But that is Jimmy Stewart.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.580
Oh, my God, Jimmy Stewart is
sexy in person.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.540
Ew. Oh.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.418
Oh, my God.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.045
- These are delicious.
- What are they?

27:51.045 --> 27:52.797
I don't even know.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.382
A little ball of something
that teaches you

27:54.382 --> 27:56.050
what pleasure is
even if you've been half-dead

27:56.050 --> 27:57.760
- your whole fucking life.
- Excuse me.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.428
Oh, no balls, just puffs.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.348
Mmm, puffs are good.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.392
Mm-hmm, I repeat,
puffs are very good.

28:04.392 --> 28:05.976
Oh, yeah.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.521
I bet if you put a puff with
a ball and maybe some cheese...

28:08.521 --> 28:10.481
Wait, hang on, we're not
supposed to be enjoying this.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.691
- Are we?
- No, we're not enjoying this.

28:12.775 --> 28:15.319
Are you crazy? We're just
eating and drinking...

28:15.403 --> 28:17.488
Ah, fuck, we are enjoying it.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.365
All right, let's get back on...

28:19.365 --> 28:22.201
Will you get out of here?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.412
The lights are different, right?

28:24.412 --> 28:26.372
- Yeah, something's happening.
- Good.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.332
I thought it was the drink.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.376
This shit has to be
what killed Toulouse-Lautrec.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.170
Where's Carole?
And the rest of the guys?

28:33.254 --> 28:34.505
I don't recognize a soul
up there.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.424
Hmm, must've gotten a new band.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.592
Ladies and
gentlemen, may I please have

28:38.676 --> 28:41.345
<i>your attention as we welcome

28:41.429 --> 28:42.763

- No, he doesn't.

29:04.452 --> 29:05.953
His hair looks thin.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.413
No, it doesn't.

29:07.413 --> 29:12.251

Are you watching this shit?

30:14.522 --> 30:16.524
This drink is
really growing on me.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.817
Now look at this.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.403
None of y'all had anywhere
else to go tonight?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.030
Well, good.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.032
'Cause now I get to gloat.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.242
Look at the girl over there.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.868
All right, now stop looking,

30:27.952 --> 30:30.663
'cause she's mine.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.915
Mrs. Shy Baldwin.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.543
I'm the luckiest man
in the world, baby.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.795
- Aw!
- And so,

30:37.795 --> 30:40.381
in honor of my wife...
Boy, that is tough to say.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.591
Um, I'll practice,
I'll practice.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.552
You just heard a little
of my new single.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.807
And it's a special one
because the lyrics were written

30:49.807 --> 30:51.809
by my boy Reggie Harris.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.894
Which is fitting because
that man's been putting words

30:53.978 --> 30:55.271
in my mouth since we were kids

30:55.271 --> 30:57.314
begging his grandmom
to buy us ice cream.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.610
He made me say
I had heat stroke...

31:01.694 --> 31:03.988
Cute story about a control freak

31:03.988 --> 31:06.574
making his pal cheat
an old lady.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.117
...the people I'm closest to.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.493
I feel your love.

31:09.577 --> 31:12.121
And my heart is
with you tonight.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.335
Feel better?

31:18.419 --> 31:20.004
- Yep.
- And now there's someone

31:20.004 --> 31:22.590
else who wants to chime in here.

31:22.590 --> 31:25.384
You know him, you love him.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.344
It's my good friend,

31:27.428 --> 31:29.638
Mr. Harry Belafonte.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.058
Yeah!

31:33.142 --> 31:34.518
Someone good!

31:39.523 --> 31:41.442
Shy, Monica,

31:41.442 --> 31:43.360
I had a special song
written for you.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.029
And I'm gonna sing it now,
if nobody minds.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.196
Three, four.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.534
Mei! I'm here!

32:32.618 --> 32:34.370
Joel? Thank God.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.455
Okay.

32:38.332 --> 32:40.250
I got a dress.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.002
I know. I got eyes.

32:42.086 --> 32:43.754
It's got a skirt and bow, see?

32:43.754 --> 32:46.256
There's birds on the top, kind
of a Peter Pan collar thing.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.633
You look great.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.218
You sure? I don't know.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.345
The skirt is weird, and I don't
know what the bird is,

32:51.345 --> 32:53.180
and why is this
a Peter Pan collar?

32:53.180 --> 32:54.473
I've seen <i>Peter Pan,</i>
I've read <i>Peter Pan.</i>

32:54.473 --> 32:55.891
I don't get the connection.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.643
Anyhow, I told
the girl at the shop

32:57.643 --> 32:59.311
that I needed a dress
to meet my...

32:59.395 --> 33:02.147
whatever you are's parents,
and she handed me this.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.691
Great.

33:03.691 --> 33:05.651
Are you sure?

33:05.651 --> 33:07.611
'Cause it's really important
that this dress is right.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.488
And while normally I don't
care what anybody thinks

33:09.488 --> 33:11.990
about anything, I feel like
there's a lot at stake here.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.784
- There's not.
- Of course there is.

33:13.784 --> 33:15.494
Are you crazy?
The first thing they see

33:15.494 --> 33:17.454
is the dress and the second
thing they see is me,

33:17.538 --> 33:19.164
so initially I asked
the lady at the shop

33:19.248 --> 33:20.916
if she had a dress
with a matzo ball print,

33:20.916 --> 33:22.960
which elicited exactly the
kind of response you'd think--

33:22.960 --> 33:25.587
deafening silence--
so I just took this one.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.048
You look perfect.

33:28.132 --> 33:30.300
My hair will be better.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.636
So, if we get a cab
within 20 minutes,

33:32.720 --> 33:34.513
we can be
at my folks' place in time.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.306
Or we can be a little late.

33:36.390 --> 33:37.933
Shorten the length
of time we're exposed.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.227
No! Oh, my God,
we can't be late!

33:40.227 --> 33:42.938
I want to do
everything perfectly.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.233
Shit. Too colorful.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.985
Is this too colorful?
It's too colorful.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.945
I couldn't see at the shop
that this was too colorful?

33:49.945 --> 33:51.905
- Mei, should I make us a drink?
- Yes.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.949
So I can be drunk and late
with a too colorful dress

33:53.949 --> 33:55.743
and a Peter Pan collar.
Thanks, Joel!

33:55.743 --> 33:57.953
- Hey, you need to relax.
- Can't.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.788
- You have to breathe.
- Nope.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.874
I like what you're wearing.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.792
But that's probably
'cause you're in it.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.503
Unbelievable.
You want to have sex now?

34:06.587 --> 34:07.838
- No.
- That was your sex call.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.423
- My what?
- Your sex call.

34:09.423 --> 34:11.341
- I do not want to have sex.
- Is that because of the dress?

34:11.425 --> 34:12.885
Please take me up on that drink.

34:12.885 --> 34:15.095
I got together with Adina
Kritzer, from pathology lab?

34:15.179 --> 34:17.055
She taught me some things
about Jewish culture.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.807
But it's all dumped
out of my head.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.642
I had Yiddish.
Now I have nothing.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.519
You have Jewish culture
right here at your disposal.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.897
I remember two words--
"tsoris" and "gefilte fish."

34:24.897 --> 34:26.815
- That's all you need to know.
- I bought a yarmulke.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.692
Mei, honey,
girls don't wear yarmulkes.

34:28.776 --> 34:30.486
What? Fuck.

34:30.486 --> 34:32.237
That would've been good
for Adina to mention.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.490
Bitch. And I'm pretty sure
all sales are final.

34:34.490 --> 34:36.325
- I'll wear the yarmulke.
- It's pink.

34:36.325 --> 34:37.576
We'll use it as a coaster.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.119
I'm gonna try on
the other dress.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.079
And throw up.
That's the sound you'll hear.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.040
Ignore it.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.173
Moishe, it's Joely and his little girlfriend!

34:51.173 --> 34:52.549
She's here, Shirl!

34:52.633 --> 34:54.301
- Don't open the door!
- I'm gonna open the door.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.678
- Don't open the door!
- I got to open the door, Shirl!

34:56.762 --> 34:59.056
I want to see her at the exact
same time you see her.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.017
Where is she?

35:02.017 --> 35:03.352
She parking the car?

35:03.352 --> 35:05.145
That's quite a greeting. Hi, Ma.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.772
Well, where is she?
What happened?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.816
Did you break up?

35:08.816 --> 35:10.651
- Let him talk, Shirl.
- She's feeling sick.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.653
- What's the matter with her?
- She's sick.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.112
It's nothing serious,
but there was a lot of sneezing.

35:14.196 --> 35:15.989
I'm devastated.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.658
I would've called ahead,
but she started feeling worse

35:17.658 --> 35:20.077
in the cab, so I dropped
her back at her apartment.

35:20.077 --> 35:22.079
Did she think she couldn't
be sick here? I'm a mother.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.039
She wanted you to have this.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.666
- She picked it out herself.
- Nice.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.292
Your lady has taste.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.211
Well, at least you can tell
us all about her over dinner.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.921
You know, you haven't
even told us her name.

35:30.921 --> 35:33.423
- It's Rachel.
- Ah, you have a cousin named Rachel.

35:33.507 --> 35:35.384
- Different Rachel.
- Rachel.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.386
Such a nice Jewish name.

35:37.386 --> 35:39.012
The nicest.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.514
Your father has
a cousin named Rachel?

35:40.514 --> 35:42.182
Different Rachel.

35:42.266 --> 35:45.143
Looks like he's got
the good kind of croutons.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.229
Motherfucker.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.529
Be right back.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.823
I have to powder my nose.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.089
You know, the lighting's
better in the ladies' room.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.592
Well, well, well.

36:16.592 --> 36:19.052
Bigger mirrors, too.

36:19.136 --> 36:21.138
You look surprised.

36:21.138 --> 36:22.890
A little.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.892
So my invitation was a mistake.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.518
I don't know.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.228
The PR team made the guest list.

36:28.312 --> 36:30.230
Jerry Lewis wasn't
invited either,

36:30.314 --> 36:31.940
if it makes you feel any better.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.692
- Not really.
- He came anyway.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.110
Princess Grace is here.
Did you see her?

36:35.110 --> 36:36.737
- No.
- Oh, you will.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.822
Hang out by the bar.

36:41.909 --> 36:43.619
Monica looks beautiful.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.787
She's a nice girl.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.081
- She enjoys puzzles.
- Oh.

36:48.165 --> 36:49.917
- Neat.
- Yeah.

36:49.917 --> 36:53.253
Neat. I bought her
a house in Beverly Hills.

36:53.337 --> 36:56.006
- Bought her a house?
- Well, I'm always traveling.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.383
- She likes oranges.
- You should get her

36:58.467 --> 37:00.510
a puzzle of an orange grove.
She'll lose her mind.

37:00.594 --> 37:03.472
First wedding anniversary gift, covered.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.349
And look at you.

37:05.349 --> 37:07.809
A wedding, a dance, a song,

37:07.893 --> 37:10.103
- and you hardly break a sweat.
- Ah.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.356
The trick's keeping the fabric
on your clothes light.

37:12.356 --> 37:14.316
Nat King Cole taught me that.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.276
He didn't come.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.570
I was looking around
for the gang.

37:18.654 --> 37:21.365
Lester, Tommy, Carole, Slim.

37:21.365 --> 37:24.326
- Got 'em locked up somewhere?
- Uh, no.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.828
- I have a new band.
- Why?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.497
I wanted a new sound.

37:28.497 --> 37:29.998
Because the old one
was such a disappointment.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.000
You got to keep things fresh.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.251
And they're
a really great group.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.836
You heard them out there.
They can really swing.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.673
Yeah. They sounded great.

37:37.673 --> 37:39.341
But you don't miss the gang?

37:39.341 --> 37:41.969
You all just seemed like family.

37:41.969 --> 37:43.512
You know what I miss?

37:43.512 --> 37:45.555
I miss your brisket.

37:45.639 --> 37:48.600
I have not had
a decent meal since the...

37:52.604 --> 37:55.565
Jack Ballard's
not much of a cook, huh?

37:55.649 --> 37:57.484
Jack Ballard's
not much of a comic, either.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.861
No. He's not.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.446
You had a good comic
for a while.

38:01.530 --> 38:02.906
Beginning of the tour.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.158
Who was that?
Trying to remember. Oh, yes.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.369
Me. What happened there?

38:07.369 --> 38:08.954
Trying to remember.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.582
I believe I can see a tarmac?

38:12.666 --> 38:15.043
And in the back there, a plane?

38:15.127 --> 38:16.586
- Was there a plane?
- There was a plane.

38:16.670 --> 38:19.631
That's right. That big thing
sitting there full of people.

38:19.715 --> 38:22.134
And it was missing
a couple of folks, right?

38:22.134 --> 38:25.053
- Was it?
- Yep. It was.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.222
You should've let me
on that plane, Shy.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.724
Oh, really? And why's that?

38:28.724 --> 38:30.058
Because I had
something to say to you.

38:30.142 --> 38:31.518
Oh, I bet you had
a lot to say to me.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.729
When you fire someone,
they get mighty chatty.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.063
Are you curious?

38:35.147 --> 38:36.481
What I would've said
if I'd gotten on the plane?

38:36.565 --> 38:37.691
Something about winged monkeys?

38:37.691 --> 38:39.735
I would've said
that I fucked up.

38:39.735 --> 38:41.570
I fucked up

38:41.570 --> 38:43.363
like I've never
fucked up anything

38:43.447 --> 38:45.490
in a life
not without its fuckups.

38:45.574 --> 38:48.160
I would've said
I was scared off my ass

38:48.160 --> 38:49.411
getting on that stage,

38:49.411 --> 38:51.496
and Moms Mabley
went on before me.

38:51.580 --> 38:52.998
Yeah, it's hard to follow Moms.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.332
I was desperate for that laugh.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.210
I was desperate
to just go out there and kill.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.087
I just thought...

38:59.171 --> 39:01.715
hometown crowd, talk about Shy.

39:01.715 --> 39:02.966
So I did.

39:03.050 --> 39:06.094
And I did kill,
which was my job,

39:06.178 --> 39:08.722
but I should have gone
in a different direction.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.724
"Shy gives a lot of money

39:10.724 --> 39:12.768
to abused children. In
other words, he pays his staff."

39:12.768 --> 39:14.686
"Before every concert, Shy
spends half an hour going..."

39:14.770 --> 39:15.896
<i>Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi ♪</i>♪

39:15.896 --> 39:17.981
"And then he starts
his vocal exercises."

39:18.065 --> 39:20.400
"Shy doesn't think
he's God's gift to the world,

39:20.484 --> 39:22.736
- but he does call his suits his wrapping paper."
- I get it.

39:22.736 --> 39:25.655
You are a treasure trove
of punch lines.

39:25.739 --> 39:28.200
But I never would have hurt you.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.912
Not on purpose.
Not for anything in the world.

39:31.912 --> 39:33.872
I thought we were friends.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.833
And I take my friendships
very seriously.

39:36.917 --> 39:40.462
I know how loaded
what I said was,

39:40.462 --> 39:42.255
and if I could take it back,
I would.

39:42.339 --> 39:44.508
If you had just let me
on that plane,

39:44.508 --> 39:46.551
I would have said I was sorry.

39:46.635 --> 39:49.179
And not to keep my job.
I'll get another job.

39:49.179 --> 39:54.017
But because I was
and still am truly sorry.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.854
If I'd have let you
on that plane,

39:57.938 --> 39:59.314
you would've brought Susie,

39:59.314 --> 40:01.775
and she would've tried
to stab me with a cheese knife.

40:01.775 --> 40:03.777
And I would have thrown myself
in front of you

40:03.777 --> 40:05.362
and taken the blow.

40:05.362 --> 40:06.863
And some Brie.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.866
Well...

40:11.868 --> 40:13.870
I sure have missed that brisket.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.458
I'll send Monica the recipe.

40:22.295 --> 40:25.423
You know, I'm back in the States

40:25.507 --> 40:27.175
for a while again next month.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.802
Cut another Christmas album.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.721
Hmm. I know what to get
my mother for Hanukkah.

40:31.805 --> 40:34.349
Maybe we could,
uh, get together,

40:34.349 --> 40:37.144
have a drink.
I-I could take you to...

40:37.144 --> 40:38.687
- No.
- No?

40:38.687 --> 40:40.647
I'm not falling for that again.

40:40.647 --> 40:42.607
We're not friends.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.693
I have learned my lesson.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.907
Congratulations.

40:50.991 --> 40:54.744
I hope you're gonna be
very happy...

40:54.828 --> 40:56.830
Dwayne.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.756
That's what I'm saying.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.134
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah, sure.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.136
Bye. Thanks for the croutons.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.638
- I ate everybody's croutons.
- Who let them in?

41:13.722 --> 41:16.224
Ladies,
would you come with us, please?

41:16.308 --> 41:17.559
We have invites.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.644
They checked them
at the door and everything.

41:27.694 --> 41:28.945
He still there?

41:29.029 --> 41:30.071
- Yep.
- He still big?

41:30.155 --> 41:31.072
- Yep.
- Mm.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.542
- Lou.
- Susie Myerson.

41:42.626 --> 41:45.462
And Mrs. Maisel.
It's nice to see you.

41:45.462 --> 41:47.672
- What is this, Lou?
- I want you to meet my associate,

41:47.756 --> 41:49.090
Ken Bruni.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.509
Ken is Shy's new agent
over at MCA.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.970
Very nice to meet you, ladies.
Enjoying the party?

41:54.054 --> 41:56.556
- Up until our abduction, it was great.
- Well,

41:56.640 --> 41:57.766
we just wanted to say hello

41:57.766 --> 42:00.477
and fill you in
on some exciting news.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.230
Shy's going to be the lead
in Billy Wilder's next film.

42:03.230 --> 42:04.648
Did you know he could act?

42:04.648 --> 42:06.316
I thought today's performance
was pretty good.

42:06.316 --> 42:07.859
I'll cut to the chase.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.486
Everyone here

42:09.486 --> 42:12.155
is aware of Shy's proclivities.

42:12.239 --> 42:15.784
But from now on,
we're gonna help him

42:15.784 --> 42:17.077
to stay
on the straight and narrow.

42:17.077 --> 42:19.329
Watch over him 24 hours a day.

42:19.329 --> 42:21.706
- Isn't that what Reggie does?
- Reggie's gone.

42:21.790 --> 42:22.916
Gone?

42:22.916 --> 42:24.501
- Holy shit.
- Look,

42:24.501 --> 42:26.962
he's a good guy, Reggie.
I like him.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.922
But he's too close with Shy

42:28.922 --> 42:31.132
to control him.
There's too much history.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.843
- And too much history with the band, too, huh?
- Exactly.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.387
Shy fought it,
but eventually he realized

42:35.387 --> 42:37.013
it was time
to chart a new course.

42:37.097 --> 42:39.557
All this because I cracked
a couple Judy Garland jokes

42:39.641 --> 42:41.142
- at the Apollo?
- No,

42:41.226 --> 42:43.061
no, this has been
a long time coming.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.397
That night at the Apollo
just gave us an opening.

42:45.397 --> 42:46.690
So, thank you.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.692
Reggie got Shy
to where he is now.

42:48.692 --> 42:51.194
- You realize that?
- Reggie's taken care of.

42:51.278 --> 42:53.488
Big severance.
We threw him some publishing.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.282
He's buying a house
in Westchester.

42:55.282 --> 42:57.325
- Everybody's happy.
- Oh, I bet.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.994
'Cause when you think Reggie,
you think Westchester.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.079
All right, Lou. Suit guy.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.164
- Ken.
- Thanks for filling us in

43:03.248 --> 43:04.624
on a bunch of stuff
we didn't give a fuck about.

43:04.708 --> 43:05.792
Okay for us to go?

43:05.792 --> 43:07.502
Just another minute
of your time.

43:07.502 --> 43:10.297
We understand you and Shy
got pretty friendly on tour

43:10.297 --> 43:12.215
and that maybe you saw
some things.

43:12.299 --> 43:15.010
One thing in particular
that occurred on a boat.

43:15.010 --> 43:17.637
We know that you thought
you were helping him,

43:17.721 --> 43:19.472
so the way it ended up with you
on the tarmac that night,

43:19.556 --> 43:22.309
it doesn't seem right.
We want to make it right.

43:22.309 --> 43:23.852
Okay.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.812
How does $2,000 sound?

43:25.812 --> 43:27.689
Two thousand dollars? Wow.

43:27.689 --> 43:30.442
- You want to give me $2,000?
- In exchange

43:30.442 --> 43:32.152
for your signature
on a legal agreement

43:32.152 --> 43:34.696
stating that you won't disparage
or besmirch Shy Baldwin

43:34.696 --> 43:37.032
in any way,
publicly or privately.

43:37.032 --> 43:39.075
You invited me
so you could bribe me?

43:39.159 --> 43:40.660
It's not a bribe.
It's an agreement.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.954
There is no way I would
ever take $2,000 from you.

43:43.038 --> 43:45.874
Uh, yeah, right.
Fuck you and your $2,000.

43:45.874 --> 43:48.335
- How about three?
- Miriam?

43:48.335 --> 43:51.212
- Nope. Three? Forget it.
- Five.

43:51.296 --> 43:53.423
Now, this is getting
very interesting.

43:53.423 --> 43:55.717
- Keep it.
- Yep.

43:55.717 --> 43:58.636
We thought about it.
Not fucking interested.

43:58.720 --> 44:00.805
- Ten.
- Okay, Miriam, that's a car.

44:00.889 --> 44:03.475
Three cars
or one big, fancy German car.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.685
- A shiny, nazi Mercedes.
- No.

44:05.769 --> 44:07.729
- No.
- Fuck! No.

44:07.729 --> 44:09.314
Last and best. Twelve.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.274
Oh, are there harps
playing somewhere?

44:11.358 --> 44:12.984
- I'm hearing harps.
- We're done here.

44:13.068 --> 44:14.194
- We are?
- Yes.

44:14.194 --> 44:15.278
- Come on.
- We'd like you

44:15.362 --> 44:16.571
to reconsider. The offer's gone

44:16.571 --> 44:17.739
as soon as
you walk out the door.

44:17.739 --> 44:19.240
I promised Shy
I would never tell anyone

44:19.324 --> 44:20.450
about that night, and I haven't.

44:20.450 --> 44:22.327
I promised Shy.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.245
Let's go.

44:24.329 --> 44:25.997
- Unless you want to...
- I want nothing from them.

44:26.081 --> 44:28.917
Yep, me, neither.
Let's go. Fuck you.

44:28.917 --> 44:30.502
Stupid idea to come here.

44:30.502 --> 44:32.837
- Was that aimed at me?
- No. Yes.

44:32.921 --> 44:35.590
- This was your idea.
- My idea? If it wasn't for you,

44:35.590 --> 44:36.883
I wouldn't have found
my invite to this thing

44:36.883 --> 44:38.968
for, like, ten months,
so this is your fault.

44:39.052 --> 44:40.553
Fuck it.
We're getting gift bags.

44:40.637 --> 44:43.181
That's tacky. I bet there's not
even anything good...

44:43.181 --> 44:44.891
Oh, my God, it's Chanel No. 5.

44:44.891 --> 44:47.102
- Get one for Grandma Mary.
- Who?

44:47.102 --> 44:49.354
Our grandmother
who couldn't come tonight

44:49.354 --> 44:51.689
but was also invited
and loves Chanel No. 5.

44:51.773 --> 44:54.192
- Got it.
- I'll meet you outside.

45:13.086 --> 45:15.338
- Where the hell were you?
- I was looking for a cab.

45:15.422 --> 45:17.173
You told me,
"Meet me out front."

45:17.257 --> 45:18.716
There weren't any cabs
out front, so I thought

45:18.800 --> 45:20.009
I'd go around the corner
because I remembered

45:20.093 --> 45:21.261
that whenever I shop
at Bergdorf's,

45:21.261 --> 45:22.846
I always go out the side door
to grab a cab

45:22.846 --> 45:25.098
- before they turn onto Fifth.
- I got this cab on Fifth.

45:25.098 --> 45:26.808
Well, it's not a foolproof plan.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.309
Just get in the goddamn car.

45:28.393 --> 45:29.978
Next time, I leave you here.

45:52.834 --> 45:55.253
<i>♪ Baby...</i>

45:55.253 --> 45:57.589
- The till's over.
- Over?

45:57.589 --> 45:59.507
That's not possible.
I did the count myself.

45:59.591 --> 46:01.092
I counted twice.
There's an extra five.

46:01.176 --> 46:02.886
Give it. I must've screwed up.

46:02.886 --> 46:04.512
Thanks for catching it.

46:04.596 --> 46:07.724
- You know this guy?
- Pop. What are you doing here?

46:07.724 --> 46:09.058
I was in the area

46:09.142 --> 46:11.019
seeing one of my notions
and trimmings guys

46:11.019 --> 46:12.187
and thought I'd stop by.

46:12.187 --> 46:13.688
Well, come on in.
I'll spot you a drink.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.190
Place looks good.

46:15.190 --> 46:18.902
The decor, the ambience.
Very impressive.

46:18.902 --> 46:21.154
Last time I was here,
it was covered in buttons.

46:21.154 --> 46:23.698
- Couple of whiskies for me and my pop.
- You got it, boss.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.575
"Boss."
I like the sound of that.

46:25.575 --> 46:28.119
- It does not get old.
- You know that the key

46:28.203 --> 46:31.080
to a great relationship
with your employees is respect.

46:31.164 --> 46:32.916
In order for them
to be productive,

46:32.916 --> 46:34.626
they got to think
you trust them unconditionally.

46:34.626 --> 46:36.503
- Absolutely.
- But every one of them's a thief,

46:36.503 --> 46:38.254
- so don't trust a single one.
- I know.

46:38.338 --> 46:40.715
I put an extra five in the till,
and he called it out.

46:40.715 --> 46:43.176
And didn't pocket it.
That means he's a keeper.

46:43.176 --> 46:45.386
I was taught by the best.

46:45.470 --> 46:46.888
Thanks.

46:46.888 --> 46:48.640
Any chance
your girlfriend's around?

46:48.640 --> 46:51.309
No. It's crunch time
at school for her.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.770
- Always with the books.
- In the summer?

46:53.770 --> 46:55.939
- It's medical school.
- Medical school.

46:55.939 --> 46:57.148
Well, well, well.

46:57.232 --> 46:59.234
She sounds interesting,
this girl.

46:59.234 --> 47:01.069
She is. She's great.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.988
With a lot of different sides
to her. Conflicting sides.

47:04.072 --> 47:06.241
- What?
- Well, the other night,

47:06.241 --> 47:07.659
the first half of dinner,
she was Rachel,

47:07.659 --> 47:09.369
sometime before kugel,
she was Rebecca,

47:09.369 --> 47:11.329
after kugel she was Ruth.
You kept them biblical.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.164
- That was nice.
- I was nervous.

47:13.248 --> 47:15.792
- And I corrected myself. You remember that, right?
- I do.

47:15.792 --> 47:17.335
Just trying to think
when was the last time

47:17.335 --> 47:19.128
I called Shirley
Sheila or Trudy.

47:19.212 --> 47:21.130
Or had to think
for a couple of seconds

47:21.214 --> 47:22.715
when somebody asked how we met.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.842
Ma's questions come
pretty fast and furious, Pop.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.636
- You know that.
- Mm-hmm.

47:26.636 --> 47:28.596
Listen, so you know,

47:28.680 --> 47:30.890
what I know
is all I need to know.

47:30.974 --> 47:33.601
- I don't know.
- You like her.

47:33.685 --> 47:35.728
That's all I know.
That's all I need to know.

47:35.812 --> 47:39.399
But keep in mind
your mother is very excited

47:39.399 --> 47:40.817
about Rachel Rebecca Ruth,

47:40.817 --> 47:42.694
and when she gets excited
about something

47:42.694 --> 47:44.195
