WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.136
Hello there, sexy.
Oh... No, don't touch the tie.

00:04.138 --> 00:07.206
I had to watch a YouTube video
to get the knot right.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.541
We made it, brother.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.744
Building a mini-mall.
What's bigger than that?

00:11.746 --> 00:13.712
Well, a mall.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.114
Yeah.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.282
I love seeing you guys
all fancy.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.285
It's a big step up
from the open robe

00:20.287 --> 00:22.254
I usually see at breakfast.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.257
You're welcome.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.326
Hey, um,

00:27.328 --> 00:28.694
since you guys are so busy,

00:28.695 --> 00:30.061
why don't I take
some personal days this week

00:30.064 --> 00:31.497
and fill in for you
as room parent?

00:31.499 --> 00:33.432
You can do that?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.601
This will give me a chance
to dazzle Mrs. Rodriguez

00:35.603 --> 00:38.037
so she'll recommend Emme
to the good first grade teacher,

00:38.039 --> 00:41.774
and not the one that takes
out her teeth during quiet time.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.475
Yeah, well, good luck.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.412
Rodriguez's bar for room parents
is way too high.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.781
I've done my best to
bring it down, but it's still...

00:48.783 --> 00:51.083
(whistles)
up there.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.518
Okay, well,
don't worry about me.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.520
You know that bar
that you haven't met?

00:54.522 --> 00:56.355
I set it.

00:56.357 --> 01:00.259
I'm just saying, she's
not an easy woman to please.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.761
Well, there's a reason she's
good-looking, but not married.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.430
There's trouble under the hood.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.833
Come on. We should get going.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.401
Kids! Time for school.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.603
I'm gonna hit
the bathroom first this time.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.571
Good thinking.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.989
(laughs):
Yeah.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.406
Every office we go to
has a different bathroom code.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.076
I can't keep 'em all straight.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.344
Last week, I had to pee
in the parking garage.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.180
I hit the car alarm

01:21.182 --> 01:24.216
when he was in mid-stream.
He looked like a lawn sprinkler.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.220
LISA:
<i> Okay, guys.</i>

01:28.222 --> 01:30.589
These bids
look excellent.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.125
And how are you coming
with those 3-D models?

01:33.127 --> 01:35.160
Good. Yeah, we hired a computer
guy, Lowell, he's great.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.129
Yeah, yeah, nice
having him around.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.397
He smells better
than any man

01:38.399 --> 01:40.132
I've ever known.
(chuckles)

01:40.134 --> 01:43.635
Well, that's important,
I suppose.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.904
So let's talk about our meeting,

01:45.905 --> 01:47.371
uh, this week
with the investors.
DON: Mm-hmm.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.708
It's critical
you appear professional.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.112
Ooh, I'll wear my tie
that looks like a fish.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.646
It's a crowd-pleaser
and very realistic.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.315
A seagull
attacked me once.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.784
That's how you know
it's a good one.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.854
All right. I think
we said enough here.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.288
Maybe too much.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.157
Uh, Lisa, we'll let you
get back to work.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.859
Oh. Okay, take care.

02:06.861 --> 02:09.194
Uh-huh. Adam,
stick around for a second.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.163
Oh?

02:11.165 --> 02:14.333
Yep, you're done.
Oh. Okay.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.301
I don't want Don at
the investors' meeting.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.404
These people need to know
their money is in serious hands,

02:19.406 --> 02:22.641
and Don's a fish tie guy.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.344
Oh, I'll tell him
to wear a regular tie.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.212
Plus, I think he might
have relieved himself

02:27.214 --> 02:29.281
in our parking garage last week.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.917
I don't think it was him.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.685
You don't have
security cameras, do you?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.687
You know...

02:35.689 --> 02:38.257
he just doesn't fit
in a corporate environment.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.359
So, take care of this for me.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.261
Okay.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.263
You're the boss.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.198
Hey, I know it's tough,
but welcome to the big leagues.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.233
Mm.
I had to fire my mother
on a Saturday,

02:48.235 --> 02:51.370
then take her out to
Easter brunch the next morning.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.206
That was a... quiet meal.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.509
What'd she do, wear a fish tie?
(chuckles)

03:00.781 --> 03:04.349
I'll, uh, I'll figure out
a way to break it to Don.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.868
Mm. Word of advice:

03:05.869 --> 03:07.386
when I'm giving someone
bad news,

03:07.388 --> 03:08.820
I always use
the direct approach.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.857
I look them in the eye,
put my hand on their shoulder,

03:11.859 --> 03:15.327
and say, "Mom, you're fired."

03:17.298 --> 03:19.665
You're right,
it does get quiet after that.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.602
¶ ¶

03:33.714 --> 03:36.348
So? How'd the meeting
with the developer go?

03:36.350 --> 03:37.683
McCaffrey didn't know
what hit her.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.717
We blew that place up.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.719
There's shrapnel
all over her office.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.554
What's he saying?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.855
Is everything ruined?

03:43.857 --> 03:46.258
No. No, it went fine.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.926
Hey, what did Lisa want
to talk to you about?

03:47.928 --> 03:49.628
Well, um...
(sighs)

03:51.365 --> 03:52.998
Okay, there's something
I need to tell you.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.267
Uh...

03:57.838 --> 04:00.739
Lisa thinks that
your fun personality

04:00.741 --> 04:03.775
might be too much
for the investors.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.277
And she, uh,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.379
she wants you to sit out
the meeting.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.964
(gasps)

04:08.965 --> 04:10.548
Could you please not do that?

04:10.551 --> 04:12.684
Well, I hope you told her
to take a flying leap.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.785
Don, we've given up

04:13.787 --> 04:15.387
all our other work for this job.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.022
Okay? Plus, she's the boss.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.324
Well, she may be the boss,
but I'm going to that meeting.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.026
I'm gonna let her know
exactly what I think of her.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.495
(gasps) Sorry,
that was me again.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.564
I'm too mad to work.
I'm gonna sit in the truck

04:25.566 --> 04:27.532
and listen to Johnny Cash
and eat my feelings.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.702
And Lowell's candies.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.804
It's a meeting,
and you're not invited.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.411
(sighs)
Oh, man, I feel terrible.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.679
Well, I'd offer you
a butterscotch,

04:40.681 --> 04:41.880
but he took them all.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.383
I've got to figure out
a way to calm him down.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.717
He cannot go
yell at Lisa.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
She fired her own mother.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.054
She'll have no problem
firing us.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.656
You know,
when I was in marketing

04:50.658 --> 04:51.690
and a client was upset,

04:51.692 --> 04:53.358
we would send them
a gift basket.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.993
It made them feel appreciated.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.029
A gift basket?
They're doing some amazing stuff

04:57.031 --> 04:59.564
with fruit these days.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.333
No. Don hates fruit.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.035
He says it's like
eating a tree's baby.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.020
And I'm not the one

05:05.021 --> 05:07.004
who needs to make him
feel appreciated, Lisa is.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.976
Ooh. Wait, what about this:

05:10.978 --> 05:13.578
I'll send Don a basket

05:13.580 --> 05:15.981
and say it's from Lisa.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.883
I see what you did.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.986
You took a nice idea
and added a lie to it.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.424
Morning, Alicia.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.992
I'm surprised to see you here.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.760
Oh, I'm covering
for Adam this week.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.095
Oh, thank God.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.630
I know, right?
(chuckles)

05:31.632 --> 05:32.664
And I just

05:32.666 --> 05:34.066
wanted to thank you for

05:34.068 --> 05:36.501
what a wonderful job
you've done with Emme this year.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.436
So here

05:37.438 --> 05:38.737
is a cup of coffee,

05:38.739 --> 05:42.107
and a muffin
from your favorite bakery.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.608
Oh.
(chuckles)

05:43.610 --> 05:45.477
And it doesn't have
anything to do with

05:45.479 --> 05:47.846
hoping you'll help get Emme
into the good first grade class.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.549
Coffee's a large, by the way.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.752
Andi, are you trying
to influence me with gifts?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.921
I don't know, am I?

05:55.923 --> 05:58.523
I think you are.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.958
And I like it.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.460
(both laugh)

06:01.462 --> 06:03.562
But honestly, a muffin?
(chuckles)

06:03.564 --> 06:06.531
Okay. I guess I'll just put it
over here with all the others.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.435
All right,
so how do we get this done?

06:10.437 --> 06:13.405
Huh? Nice bottle of wine,
spa day?

06:13.407 --> 06:15.741
I drop a $20 and walk away?

06:15.743 --> 06:17.743
(sighs) You know,
if I was so overwhelmed

06:17.745 --> 06:19.478
by the amazing job you did

06:19.480 --> 06:20.946
with the kids'
Spring Fling party this week--

06:20.948 --> 06:22.447
I'm thinking Hawaiian luau--

06:23.484 --> 06:25.417
I'd say we have a deal.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.819
(laughs): A Hawaiian luau
for a bunch of kids?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.054
Oh, you're serious.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.622
Um, yeah.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.392
All right, yeah.
I'm on it. Surf's up.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.893
(chuckles)

06:34.895 --> 06:35.861
(softly):
Damn.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.964
Yeah, I took your advice,
what do you think?

06:38.966 --> 06:40.665
Don's going to love it.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.768
And he can repurpose
this basket for so many things.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.870
Picnics, an herb garden.
He could put it

06:44.872 --> 06:46.838
on the front of his bike
and drive around

06:46.840 --> 06:48.824
with a little dog in there.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.809
Lowell, you want the
basket after he's done?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.878
If you could put a good word in,
I'd appreciate it.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.814
Hey, Lowell.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.048
Backstabber.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.152
What's this?

07:00.154 --> 07:01.920
Oh, yeah, that came
for you today.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.121
We don't know
who it's from.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.056
Eh, someone knows,
but not the two of us.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.925
(clicks tongue)

07:08.862 --> 07:10.195
"Dear Don, between us,

07:10.197 --> 07:11.830
"you're my favorite
Burns brother.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.432
Lisa."

07:14.034 --> 07:15.350
Why would she send me this

07:15.351 --> 07:16.667
if she doesn't want me
at the meeting?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.870
Great question.
Lowell?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.906
Me?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.544
It's because
she appreciates you.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.611
(snaps fingers)

07:29.583 --> 07:31.516
I know what's
going on here.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.751
You do?

07:32.753 --> 07:35.587
Mm-hmm. She's into me.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.190
Look at this stuff:
wine, chocolates.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.091
All aphrodisiacs.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.227
This woman wants to lay with me.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.696
What's that, now?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.965
Yeah, that's-that's why she
doesn't want me at the meeting.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.900
She's worried she can't
control herself around me.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.001
She's a hungry bear,

07:50.003 --> 07:51.837
and I'm a pot of honey.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.973
It wouldn't be right
to yell at her now.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.908
Yeah, you're-you're
right.
Yeah.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.577
He's right, it
wouldn't be right.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.780
Yeah, I mean, uh, you can't
yell at a woman in love.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.081
That'd be mean.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.649
And you're not
mean, you're...

08:04.651 --> 08:06.151
a, uh... you're a...

08:06.153 --> 08:07.986
What is he, Lowell?
Pot of honey.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.822
You're a pot of honey.
That's right, yeah.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.891
Yeah, okay, so you skip the
meeting, I'll handle that.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.060
And everybody will live
happily ever after.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.028
Right?

08:16.029 --> 08:16.995
You take the things
in the basket,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.263
I'll take the basket,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.732
and it'll be like
it never happened.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.902
Thank you for
volunteering to help me.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.737
Rodriguez is out of her
mind with this party.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.639
Well, so just tell her
it's too much.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.508
Sounds like someone
already got their daughter

08:29.510 --> 08:31.643
into the good
first grade class. Hmm?

08:31.645 --> 08:35.881
I learned Spanish and picked
her mother up from the airport.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.917
Or<i> aeropuerto.</i>

08:38.919 --> 08:42.687
Okay, well, I can't do that,
so this party has to kick butt.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.023
But, I mean, look
at this list.

08:45.025 --> 08:49.895
I mean, inflatable palm trees,
grass skirts, virgin daiquiris?

08:49.897 --> 08:53.865
Why don't I just resurrect
Don Ho while I'm at it?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.133
Don who?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.167
Ho.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.870
Don't get nasty.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.039
(laughs):
No.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.042
Don Ho was a ukulele player
from the '70s.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.077
Oh.
Yeah.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.080
Sometimes I forget how much
older you guys are than me.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.120
I worded that
incorrectly.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.988
Mm-hmm.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.026
Wait, so Lisa McCaffrey's
coming on to Don?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.294
My husband has
that effect on women.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.995
Every time
he leaves the house,

09:23.997 --> 09:27.299
it's like throwing a hunk
of meat into an alligator pit.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.835
I mean, some of
this is my fault.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.871
There I was, parading around
her in my khaki Dockers

09:32.873 --> 09:34.606
like a Chippendale.
(giggles)

09:34.608 --> 09:37.142
I got an idea:
let's stop talking about this,

09:37.144 --> 09:38.777
and just build
a mini-mall. Hmm?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.111
Yeah.
Well, hold on.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.780
He can't act
like nothing happened.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.615
Don, you have
to tell her

09:43.617 --> 09:46.685
that she needs to keep
her horny mitts off of you.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.986
What? No, he doesn't.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.154
Yeah, I'm with Marcy.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.156
What? No, you're not.
Ye-Yeah,

09:51.158 --> 09:53.158
I mean, a woman doesn't
write a guy a note like that

09:53.160 --> 09:55.126
if she's not interested.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.261
I mean, is-isn't she
recently divorced?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.063
No, no, no.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.632
It's been,
like, three months.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.703
Yeah, and now she wants to
bounce back with a married guy,

10:04.705 --> 10:07.205
which is exactly
how I'd play it.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.308
Well, sounds like you put
some thought into that.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.143
Okay, everybody,
just relax, all right?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.345
She sent him
a gift basket,

10:13.347 --> 10:16.147
not her underwear
and a motel key.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.883
Nobody needs to
talk to Lisa.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.685
Well, I think he needs
to say something to her.

10:20.687 --> 10:21.753
Don't you agree, Andi?

10:21.755 --> 10:22.887
No, she doesn't agree.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.656
Don't talk for me.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.759
I thought
you loved that.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.928
I think you
know I don't.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.997
If I were talking for you
right now,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.898
I would say
you love that.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.036
Marcy, I-I think
you're right.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.071
I should let Lisa know
that this pot of honey

10:40.073 --> 10:43.642
already has a mean,
beautiful she-bear.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.511
I'm gonna call
her tomorrow.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.178
What? No, I don't think
you should do that at all.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.048
I think you should
just let it go.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.916
Drop it, choke it,
put it in a sack,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.218
throw it in the river.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.020
Nah, I'm gonna
call her tomorrow.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.321
Yeah, good boy.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.089
Now, let's go home
for your reward.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.057
Ooh.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.760
My she-bear's
on the prowl.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.130
You're a good husband, Don.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.166
What are you doing?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.152
What are<i> you</i> doing?

11:10.153 --> 11:12.137
If he calls Lisa,
the mini-mall project is dead.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.238
Why?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.106
Because she didn't
seduce my brother.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.008
I did!

11:22.115 --> 11:24.783
So you sent Don
a fancy gift basket?
Right.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.185
And for Mother's Day,
you got me a Sausage McMuffin.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.088
Can we stick to
the problem at hand, huh?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.257
Don is gonna call our boss

11:32.259 --> 11:34.025
and break off a relationship

11:34.027 --> 11:36.428
she doesn't know exists
because it doesn't exist.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.380
Okay? And when

11:38.381 --> 11:40.331
that happens,
the mini-mall is dead.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.034
Well, then you need
to do the right thing.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.869
I agree.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.706
What is that?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.240
You have to keep lying.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.179
(laughs)
Is this one of those times

11:54.181 --> 11:56.247
where you say one thing,
but you mean the opposite?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.916
Huh? Like when you said

11:57.918 --> 12:00.285
you'd never bring up
the Mother's Day McMuffin again?

12:00.287 --> 12:03.288
Look, right now,
you need to protect

12:03.290 --> 12:05.290
both Don and the mini-mall job.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.192
It's time to
double down, babe.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.262
I like this side of you.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.099
Okay. Here's how you
handle it, all right?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.801
You send Don another
note from Lisa

12:16.803 --> 12:19.971
and say, "We have to keep
our feelings a secret

12:19.973 --> 12:22.307
and never discuss them,
not even with each other."

12:22.309 --> 12:24.976
Ooh, that's clever.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.478
Mm.
Yeah-- wait.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.446
Should I be worried
about how good you are

12:28.448 --> 12:29.981
at manipulating people?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.217
What?

12:32.219 --> 12:35.754
Honey, you're way
too smart for that.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.864
All this party
stuff looks great.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.767
Do they even have
monkeys in Hawaii?

12:48.769 --> 12:52.871
Well, I almost passed out
blowing them up, so they do now.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.875
We may have overdone it
with the virgin daiquiris.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.144
There's a ton left inside.
Good.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.180
Later, we'll mix in some rum
and celebrate Emme

13:02.182 --> 13:04.315
getting the good
first grade teacher.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.356
"Dear Don, we have to keep
our feelings a secret

13:11.358 --> 13:14.259
"and never discuss them,
not even with each other.

13:15.562 --> 13:20.098
"I know you may want to,
but you shouldn't. Lisa.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.568
P.S. Don't talk
to me about this."

13:23.570 --> 13:27.405
And I may be reading between
the lines, but sounds to me--

13:27.407 --> 13:29.974
this is just me--

13:29.976 --> 13:31.509
it sounds like
you shouldn't call her.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.344
Well, no need to.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.113
Right before
you got in,

13:35.115 --> 13:37.315
I sent her some flowers
with a steamy note.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.118
You sent her flowers?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.553
Why would you do that?

13:41.555 --> 13:42.554
Because I got to thinking.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.122
Why would you do that?

13:44.124 --> 13:46.391
We can't afford to screw up
this mini-mall gig,

13:46.393 --> 13:48.259
so I need to keep her
on the hook.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.996
It's a dance, Adam,
and you're looking at Beyoncé.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.332
No, I'm not!

14:01.308 --> 14:03.575
Lowell?

14:05.912 --> 14:07.212
You okay?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.547
Hiya.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.383
What's the matter with you?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.452
I must've dozed off.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.522
I had a few
virgin daiquiris.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.291
They made me happy.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.428
Then dancy,
then sleepy.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.097
I've been every dwarf today.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.901
Oh, my God.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.070
There's alcohol in here.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.339
That explains a lot.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.041
How can that be?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.643
I mean, t-the label
says "virgin."

14:38.645 --> 14:41.830
What?

14:41.831 --> 14:45.016
Oh... it's Tropical Virgin
<i> brand</i> daiquiri.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.587
It's not tropical
virgin daiquiri.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.456
Okay, the kids are
still at assembly.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.925
I have 15 minutes before they
get drunk and I get arrested.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.059
Wait, Andi.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.361
What?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.363
On your way back,
pick up some tacos.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.430
Oh, my...

15:05.438 --> 15:07.572
(whispers):
Okay.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.313
Good morning.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.649
What are you doing?

15:17.651 --> 15:21.019
I'm just wishing everyone
good morning.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.053
Yeah.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.221
Okay, got to go.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.489
I'm off to accounting, then HR.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.124
What a bunch of stiffs they are.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.325
(laughs)

15:27.327 --> 15:29.360
Are those flowers for me?

15:29.362 --> 15:32.030
Uh, no, no, different Lisa.
(chuckles)

15:32.032 --> 15:34.699
Oh, so, you're in my office
with flowers

15:34.701 --> 15:37.669
for a different person
named Lisa?

15:37.671 --> 15:40.004
Yes.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.373
Lisa... Marie Presley.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.474
Yeah.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.542
I'm a big fan, yeah.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.577
Is she in yet?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.614
Okay, everyone,
it's time to start

15:49.616 --> 15:51.149
our Hawaiian luau.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.251
CHILDREN:
Yay!

15:56.489 --> 15:59.457
(distorted):
No!

16:07.400 --> 16:10.401
Is there alcohol in this?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.571
Yes, but... the good news is:

16:13.573 --> 16:16.074
none of the kids
are driving, so...

16:17.477 --> 16:20.078
So, because of you,
fish tie guy

16:20.080 --> 16:22.747
thinks I have
the hots for him.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.718
Do you have any idea
how unprofessional all this is?

16:28.088 --> 16:30.288
I have a sense.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.656
Look, I was
just trying

16:31.658 --> 16:33.358
to keep the project on track

16:33.360 --> 16:35.426
and protect
my brother's feelings.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.528
Well, turns out
you can't do both.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.465
Then you know what?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.100
I get that this
investor meeting's important,

16:42.102 --> 16:43.735
but here's the deal:

16:43.737 --> 16:47.372
either Don and I do it together
or we don't do it at all.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.741
And that's your bottom line?

16:49.743 --> 16:52.110
Yep. I'll walk away.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.078
Okay.

17:00.754 --> 17:03.421
I'm walking.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.257
Here I go.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.459
Don't try to stop me.
(scoffs)

17:08.461 --> 17:09.761
You're barely moving.
Well, I want you

17:09.763 --> 17:12.363
to get a good look
at what you're losing.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.768
Did you say something?

17:16.770 --> 17:18.569
Nope.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.605
Okay, look, I know
business is business,

17:20.607 --> 17:22.540
but I have a<i> family</i> business.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.108
My brother and I
like each other.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.377
Our brunches are very loud.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.547
Well, I do appreciate
your loyalty.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.151
My therapist says it's good
for me to be around people

17:33.153 --> 17:35.686
who experience
real human emotions.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.558
Had to have a therapist
tell you that, huh?

17:40.560 --> 17:43.294
Well, things have been
quiet at my house

17:43.296 --> 17:45.530
since my mom moved out.

17:45.532 --> 17:49.534
Yeah, I didn't just fire her,
I also evicted her.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.069
Ouch.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.538
Tell you what:

17:53.540 --> 17:56.407
because you guys
are the best in the business,

17:56.409 --> 17:57.241
if we never

17:57.243 --> 17:58.609
have to talk about this

17:58.611 --> 18:00.311
ever again, we're good.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.613
And Don can come to the meeting.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.732
Thank you.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.850
And don't worry,
this is definitely over.

18:06.853 --> 18:07.718
(mouths)

18:07.720 --> 18:09.153
Look, baby,

18:09.155 --> 18:10.488
we got to call
this thing off.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.623
What are you doing here?

18:12.625 --> 18:15.493
Well, I'm just hanging.
This is my hang now.

18:15.495 --> 18:19.263
Look, I tried to play this game,

18:19.265 --> 18:21.299
but I'm a one-woman man.
(groans)

18:22.669 --> 18:25.103
Fact is, I'm not Beyoncé.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.638
I'm Adele.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.408
I rock the house,
but I don't dance.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.677
Okay, you know what,
I've had enough.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.613
This is getting
ridiculous.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.681
Don...

18:36.683 --> 18:39.684
Did you say Don or Mom?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.422
Don...

18:45.525 --> 18:48.359
I want you real bad.

18:52.265 --> 18:56.667
But I can't have you,
so please leave.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.539
Listen, you're a special lady.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.441
If something should happen
to my wife,

19:03.443 --> 19:04.742
I'll put you on the list.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.810
(mouths)

19:07.814 --> 19:08.846
Okay,

19:08.848 --> 19:09.814
good-bye.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.789
Playing the mom card was cold.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.791
You're a good businessman.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.627
But don't let it
happen again.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.629
You already have two strikes.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.596
Two strikes?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.632
We have security cameras

19:27.634 --> 19:29.467
in the parking garage.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.311
So I'm guessing
Emme's not getting

19:40.313 --> 19:43.214
the good first
grade teacher?

19:43.216 --> 19:45.316
No, she's in.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.253
All I had to do was promise
that neither of us

19:49.255 --> 19:50.788
would be room parent next year.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.326
You got us banned
from being room parents?

19:55.328 --> 19:56.978
Mm-hmm.

19:56.979 --> 19:58.629
I have never been more
in love with you.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.732
(doorbell rings)
Mm.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.367
Will you grab that?

20:03.369 --> 20:04.635
Mm-hmm.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.808
What's this?

20:10.810 --> 20:13.511
I don't know. Read the card.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.450
Okay.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.385
"Thanks for your help
this week.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.721
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world. Love, Adam."

20:23.723 --> 20:25.590
Aw.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.458
(squeals)

20:29.996 --> 20:32.697
It's a Sausage McMuffin.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.636
You get it?
That's our thing now.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.371
It is kind of cute.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.539
(chuckles)

20:41.541 --> 20:44.375
And yum.
(chuckles)

20:44.377 --> 20:45.776
Wow, that smells good.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.878
I should've sent
two of those.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.714
You're gonna
have to fight me for it.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.549
Well, you better start running.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.484
(scoffs)

20:53.486 --> 20:55.720
No, no!
Give me that muffin!

20:55.722 --> 20:57.722
Yeah. (whoops)
