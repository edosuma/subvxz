07:44.710 --> 07:46.080
- [laughing]
- Wow.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.650
Yeah. I have to imagine

07:47.650 --> 07:49.950
you've dated some other women.

07:49.950 --> 07:52.090
- No. No.
- So, you've never been involved

07:52.090 --> 07:53.420
with someone else,

07:53.420 --> 07:55.320
and then all of a sudden
Nevaeh comes around

07:55.330 --> 07:56.820
and you have to be like,
"Oh, [bleep]."

07:56.830 --> 08:00.230
- There was one girl.
We was talking hard.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.700
- Okay. For how long?

08:01.700 --> 08:04.130
- Four months at least.

08:04.130 --> 08:06.070
Then Nevaeh came back.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.600
And then conversation was--
- And you were hardly talking?

08:08.610 --> 08:10.470
- Never talking.
Dude, I never talked--

08:10.470 --> 08:12.810
- So, you'll drop a real girl

08:12.810 --> 08:15.610
for Nevaeh in a heartbeat.
- In a heartbeat.

08:15.610 --> 08:17.110
Because I'm soft for her.
- Right.

08:17.110 --> 08:19.310
How many pictures
do you think she's sent you

08:19.320 --> 08:20.450
in the last eight years?

08:20.450 --> 08:22.620
- Probably like eight to nine.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.720
- Okay, so not a lot.
- Nah.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.790
- I mean, I send that many
pictures usually in a week...

08:26.790 --> 08:28.390
- Right.
- With my--with my girl.

08:28.390 --> 08:29.790
- It's really--like I said,
it's really getting

08:29.790 --> 08:31.090
to the point where, like,

08:31.090 --> 08:33.360
the stress is starting
to, like, affect me.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.000
Like, I'm starting to lose hair.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.429
Like I said,
I recently was in the hospital.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.600
They say it was dehydration.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.799
I say it's stress.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.240
- You think
you were in the hospital

08:42.240 --> 08:44.870
because you're lovesick?

08:44.870 --> 08:46.870
- Yeah.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.540
It's time for a change.

08:48.550 --> 08:50.610
- Which could be
starting a life together...

08:50.610 --> 08:52.250
- Peeow!
- Or...

08:52.250 --> 08:55.580
finding out
that she's been lying to you.

08:55.590 --> 08:57.950
- I'd rather know
than not know.

08:57.950 --> 08:59.890
I feel like the time has come.

08:59.890 --> 09:01.220
- Wow.
All right.

09:01.220 --> 09:04.360
Sounds like at any moment
she could poof, disappear,

09:04.360 --> 09:05.590
so, Max, we got work to do.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.260
- All right.
- Let's get out of here.

09:07.260 --> 09:08.930
- All right, good to see you.
- All right, guys.

09:08.930 --> 09:11.670
I appreciate it.
- All right, man.

09:11.670 --> 09:13.470
- I like this guy.
- I like him a lot.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.100
- I want to see him
find love here.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.510
I mean, for eight years, he's
been basically off the market...

09:18.510 --> 09:20.540
- Right.
- Because he's in love with her.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.910
- Man, and I hate to say it,

09:21.910 --> 09:23.610
but, like, my gut is
it's a catfish.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.420
- Check this out.
Boom.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.650
both: Ohh! Whoa!

09:31.650 --> 09:34.160
- Oh, my God!

09:34.160 --> 09:35.220
- [laughs]

09:36.490 --> 09:38.160
- All right, so.
- Alante and Nevaeh.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.760
<i> - Alante and Nevaeh have been</i>
<i> talking for eight years.</i>

09:40.760 --> 09:42.860
She comes and goes. She
disappears with no explanation.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.470
Then she shows back up.

09:44.470 --> 09:47.300
<i> She makes plans to meet up,</i>
<i> then blows you off.</i>

09:47.300 --> 09:50.070
<i> She's got all the makings</i>
<i> of a classic catfish.</i>

09:50.070 --> 09:53.510
<i> But she seems to really care</i>
<i> about Alante.</i>

09:53.510 --> 09:55.810
Look, we got an email here
from Alante.

09:55.810 --> 09:58.010
"Hey, guys. This is the info
I have on Nevaeh.

09:58.010 --> 10:01.250
"This is her number
that she texts me from now.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.050
"This is the number I call her
on sometimes to talk."

10:04.050 --> 10:05.650
Which is weird.
So, Nevaeh has two numbers.

10:05.660 --> 10:07.460
One for texting
and one for talking.

10:07.460 --> 10:08.760
"Here's a link to her Facebook.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.630
"I also attached some pics
that she sent...

10:10.630 --> 10:12.730
"so it's not a lot.
Good luck."

10:12.730 --> 10:13.860
- Cheers.
- All right,

10:13.860 --> 10:15.500
let's do
a little picture search.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.830
[exhales sharply]
- Did we get something?

10:18.840 --> 10:20.900
- Ooh--ah--no.
- Ugh.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.170
- Here we go. Come on. Come on.

10:23.170 --> 10:24.470
[inhales sharply]

10:24.470 --> 10:25.970
No, we got nothing.
- Ugh.

10:25.980 --> 10:27.840
- Well, there's more pictures
on her Facebook page

10:27.840 --> 10:29.180
that we could download.
- That's true.

10:29.180 --> 10:32.750
- Save. Save.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.120
Save.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.750
- Hold on.
Let's run some new pics in.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.420

We got a hit!

10:42.390 --> 10:44.030
Click on one of these links.

10:44.030 --> 10:45.360
- "I'm getting closer to my--"
- This is her blog!

10:45.360 --> 10:46.560
- Look. Instagram.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.660
- Oh, boy.

10:47.660 --> 10:50.230
So, this is Audrey.
- Boom.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.630
- She's based in Brooklyn.
She's a journalist, blogger.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.800
She's got 13,000 followers.
- Wow.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.400
She's Insta-famous.
Oh, look.

10:56.410 --> 10:58.540
There's one of the pictures
we saw, right there.

10:58.540 --> 11:00.140
- Ugh, yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.840
- This girl is definitely
who's in the photos.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.750
- Yeah.
- We found the mask.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.880
- Right.
Now we need to figure out

11:06.880 --> 11:08.480
who he's actually talking to.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.750
And the only thing we know is

11:09.750 --> 11:11.590
that this is
their Facebook page.

11:11.590 --> 11:14.760
Let's see here. Says she lives
in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.790
345 friends.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.930
Not a ton.
- No.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.430
- But--
- It's a real amount.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.100
- Right. It's like--
- Is there some way to see

11:22.100 --> 11:24.070
how many of her friends are
mutual with Alante?

11:24.070 --> 11:25.070
- I don't know.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.070
- Really?

11:38.550 --> 11:40.680
- Whoa.
- What is this hack?

11:43.020 --> 11:46.690
- All right, so I'm gonna do
facebook.com/

11:46.690 --> 11:48.090
Nevaeh plus?

11:48.090 --> 11:49.090
- No. A-N-D.

11:49.090 --> 11:51.490
Question mark, A-N-D,
equal sign.

11:51.490 --> 11:54.400
- Question mark, and, equals,

11:54.400 --> 11:56.960
and then Alante's username.

11:56.970 --> 12:00.270
This should show us
mutual friends.

12:00.270 --> 12:02.040
Whoa!
- What?

12:02.040 --> 12:03.670
- This is awesome.
- Yeah.

12:03.670 --> 12:05.810
- So, yeah, 46 mutual friends.

12:05.810 --> 12:06.940
- Which is a lot.
- That's a lot,

12:06.940 --> 12:08.280
for someone he doesn't know.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.610
Are they all in Saginaw?
- Yeah, they are.

12:10.610 --> 12:12.050
- They're all Saginaw people.

12:12.050 --> 12:13.680
- All right, so,
let's just send a message

12:13.680 --> 12:16.180
to all 46
of their mutual friends.

12:16.190 --> 12:19.150
Really simple.
"How do you know Nevaeh?"

12:19.160 --> 12:21.890
All right, so, "Hey Aletha...
could use your help.

12:21.890 --> 12:23.220
"Wondering
how you know Nevaeh Watson.

12:23.230 --> 12:24.660
Please get back to me
as soon as you can."

12:24.660 --> 12:25.730
- Okay.
- All right. Let's just

12:25.730 --> 12:26.730
fire them out.

12:26.730 --> 12:28.400
- Anna [bleep].
- Dion.

- Seiairah.
Qua.

12:37.070 --> 12:39.610
[sighs]
- We have now sent out messages

12:39.610 --> 12:42.140
to all 46 people.
- You know what time it is?

12:42.150 --> 12:43.810
- Time to run
those phone numbers.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.750
- You got it.
So, here's the phone number

12:45.750 --> 12:47.450
they text on.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.620
Okay. Here we go.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.020
Iowa Falls?
- Something.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.950
- Oh, that's a landline,

12:52.960 --> 12:54.790
so it's probably a text app.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.760
- So, it's, like,
an Internet number.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.130
- All right, let's try again

12:58.130 --> 13:00.530
with the other number
that they talk on.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.260
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

13:02.270 --> 13:03.930
- We gonna get something.
- Come on.

13:03.930 --> 13:05.530
- Oh! We got a few hits.
- Ooh, whoa.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.840
Christopher [bleep]
and then Latoya [bleep].

13:07.840 --> 13:10.140
We know it's a woman that's been
talking to him on the phone.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.910
- Well, who's Latoya [bleep]?

13:11.910 --> 13:14.140
- Let's search Facebook.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.850
- Oh, boy. That's--
- Saginaw! Boom!

13:18.850 --> 13:20.280
- That's her.
- Boom!

13:20.280 --> 13:22.650
- That's got to be her.
- Okay.

13:22.650 --> 13:26.050
Let's see if he and Latoya have
any friends in common.

13:26.060 --> 13:29.960
- New hack.
Question mark, "and," equals...

13:31.390 --> 13:32.930

- Wow. That's a lot.
This is a big clue.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.760
This connects them.

13:36.770 --> 13:39.170
- All right, so, look. We know
that the girl in the pictures

13:39.170 --> 13:41.840
that's Nevaeh's been sending
to Alante

13:41.840 --> 13:43.240
are not her.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.770
- We found a number linked
to a woman in Saginaw

13:46.780 --> 13:48.810
named named Latoya [bleep].

13:48.810 --> 13:51.380
It's very possible
that this Latoya woman

13:51.380 --> 13:52.510
could be the catfish.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.780
- She is our prime suspect.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.620
- Oh! We got something.
- Oh! Oh, man.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.490
Royon says "I called the number.
It went to voicemail."

13:59.490 --> 14:01.360
All right,
let's give him a call.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.530
- Yeah, hi. Is this Royon?

This is Nev from "Catfish,"

where you live, right?

14:20.680 --> 14:22.510
- And we saw that you're friends

14:22.510 --> 14:26.080
with a girl named Nevaeh Watson.

14:28.850 --> 14:30.380
- So, how do you know her?

- Whoa. Okay, so you guys have
been flirting, like,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.430

29:23.750 --> 29:25.910
So, you got to fill us in here.

- Seiairah told me
she had a crush on Alante,

29:28.180 --> 29:31.150
and I told her not to pursue it.

29:31.150 --> 29:33.490
- Why?
- Because you're my friend.

29:33.490 --> 29:36.260
That's my brother. I don't want
to be in the middle.

29:36.260 --> 29:38.590
So, I gave her her proof

29:38.590 --> 29:41.430
that you were talking
to other people on Facebook.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.430

you didn't want

29:47.370 --> 29:49.040
some other girl
to be with Alante

29:49.040 --> 29:50.640
because you wanted
to be with Alante.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.070
- No. Not at all.

29:52.070 --> 29:53.910
That's it.
That's my brother.

29:53.910 --> 29:56.310
- Well, he's not your brother.
You're not actually related.

29:56.310 --> 29:57.940
- No. Not blood-related, no.
- Right.

But you're very close,
and he's your God-brother.

30:00.350 --> 30:02.080
- Yes.
- At what point

30:02.080 --> 30:04.050
did you make a fake profile,

30:04.050 --> 30:05.320
decide to name it Nevaeh--

30:05.320 --> 30:07.150
- I had already made it.
- Okay.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.590
- So, it was
just something originally

30:08.590 --> 30:10.520
that me and all my friends did
in high school,

30:10.530 --> 30:12.760
because I had some friends
who were, you know,

30:12.760 --> 30:15.760
"Hey, add my boyfriend,"
or "Add this person,"

30:15.760 --> 30:18.730
so I added them
as Nevaeh's friend,

30:18.730 --> 30:21.970
and immediately
they would poke her on Facebook,

30:21.970 --> 30:23.300
direct message her,

30:23.310 --> 30:27.170
and that right there
was your proof that

30:27.180 --> 30:29.540
he'll engage in a conversation
with somebody else.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.410
- So, why keep this Nevaeh
profile going so long

30:32.410 --> 30:33.680
with Alante?
- Right, why keep it going

30:33.680 --> 30:35.580
for eight years?
- Because after a while,

30:35.580 --> 30:37.080
you know, I told Seiairah--I was
like, "You think it's time?"

30:37.090 --> 30:39.620
You know, "Is it time for me
to just let it go?"

30:39.620 --> 30:41.450
And Seiairah:
"No. Write him back."

30:41.460 --> 30:44.360
- Why do you have her back
over his?

30:44.360 --> 30:46.260
- I mean, because I'm a female,

30:46.260 --> 30:48.800
so I knew
what she was going through.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.000
- This sounds like bull[bleep].

30:51.000 --> 30:52.730
- I mean--

30:52.730 --> 30:55.970
- I'm gonna walk over there
with Alante

30:55.970 --> 30:57.770
just to check in with him.

30:57.770 --> 31:00.810

When you were young,

you and Seiairah had something.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.120
- She had something.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.850
We were talking.
- Right.

31:11.850 --> 31:13.450
- There wasn't no touching.
- She had a much bigger crush

31:13.460 --> 31:15.120
on you.
You were the older guy.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.860
- I was the older guy.
- Okay.

31:16.860 --> 31:19.530
But did--did you ever
do anything to make her feel

31:19.530 --> 31:21.190

31:21.200 --> 31:22.530
- No.
- No.

a young state of mind.

if you had been in the room

31:28.300 --> 31:30.140

to Nevaeh before,

31:30.140 --> 31:31.700
did you make that up?

31:31.710 --> 31:34.570

in the room. I was on one side

Alante was on the couch.

talking to him, and, you know,

Alante was so caught up
in talking to her,

- Good to see you, too.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.139
- Here--why don't you sit here?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.580
- Okay.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.920
Maybe, Alante,
if you want to start.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.020
- Uh...

34:33.020 --> 34:34.750
pretty much why?

34:34.760 --> 34:37.620
The whole Seiairah thing.
- Mm-hmm.

34:37.630 --> 34:39.090
- What the [bleep]?

34:39.090 --> 34:40.560
Like...

34:40.560 --> 34:44.060
in order for you to be
feeling some type of way,

34:44.070 --> 34:46.870
she had to really be
in a relationship with me?

34:46.870 --> 34:48.500
- She liked him.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.270
But my thing is this:
if you play me,

34:51.270 --> 34:54.510
I'm going to get you
when you least expect it.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.409
If you hurt me,
I'm gonna hurt you.

34:56.409 --> 34:58.140
It might not--
- Did Alante hurt you?

34:58.150 --> 35:01.550
- Uh-uh.
- Well, you remember the dude

35:01.550 --> 35:02.720
that lives around
the corner from me?

35:02.720 --> 35:05.020
- Yep.
- That's your friend.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.950
You knew your friend
was a dog,

35:06.960 --> 35:09.690
and you ain't tell me.
I'm your sister, right?

35:09.690 --> 35:11.590
You didn't tell me
that he was a dog.

35:11.590 --> 35:12.960
- So what happened,
you were dating someone?

35:12.960 --> 35:14.990
- I was in a relationship
with one of his friends,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.830
off and on
for about seven years.

35:16.830 --> 35:18.700
And he told him
that he didn't think that

35:18.700 --> 35:20.570
the relationship was
that serious,

35:20.570 --> 35:22.900
but yet Alante
never told me that,

35:22.900 --> 35:24.540
"Hey, he not really into you."

35:24.540 --> 35:27.610
I felt like because of the type
of bond that we had,

35:27.610 --> 35:30.580
maybe you would have understood
where I was coming from,

35:30.580 --> 35:32.180
just as a female.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.650
- I don't know what
Tyler Perry movie you watched

35:34.650 --> 35:36.550
and got that idea from, but...

35:36.550 --> 35:37.950
- But you knew
that he was--

35:37.950 --> 35:40.420
- But he strung me along
for 7 1/2 years--

35:40.420 --> 35:42.760
- I shouldn't have had
to tell you. He showed it.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.190
- But how was
I supposed to know?

35:44.190 --> 35:46.860
He didn't start showing it
until later on.

35:46.860 --> 35:49.230
Time had already
been invested.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.830
- I hope you had fun doing it,
'cause, uh--

35:51.830 --> 35:54.530
- I hope at the end
of the day you still under--

35:54.540 --> 35:56.940
you understand
what was going on,

35:56.940 --> 35:58.270
and you're not.
- No, I never took--

35:58.270 --> 35:59.970
- Whoa, wait, Ericka.
- You don't.

35:59.970 --> 36:01.540
- Ericka, wait.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.940
You're obviously, like,
very angry

36:04.950 --> 36:08.080
and very hurt
by the way you feel

36:08.080 --> 36:09.980
the world has treated you.

36:09.980 --> 36:12.990
I mean, the truth is that,
like, you're not entirely

36:12.990 --> 36:16.990
being honest with yourself
for why you did this.

36:16.990 --> 36:20.690
- It's been [bleep] years.

36:20.700 --> 36:24.960
Like, how do you explain
something like this?

36:24.970 --> 36:28.430
- I mean, I kind of just--

36:28.440 --> 36:33.540
I didn't--I didn't think
about the aftermath.

36:33.540 --> 36:36.380
I didn't mean
for it to go this far.

36:36.380 --> 36:39.480
I just, you know, I got
so caught up and wrapped up

36:39.480 --> 36:41.980
in being Nevaeh.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.520
I actually liked it.
I did.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.080
<i> Because I have been told that,</i>

36:45.090 --> 36:46.820
<i> "Oh, you're pretty</i>
<i> for a dark-skinned girl."</i>

36:46.820 --> 36:48.090
<i> "You're pretty</i>
<i> to be kind of chunky."</i>

36:48.090 --> 36:49.520
<i> "You're pretty to be short."</i>

36:49.520 --> 36:51.460
<i> But Nevaeh's confident.</i>

36:51.460 --> 36:52.760
<i> She's pretty.</i>

36:52.760 --> 36:54.860
<i> She's light.</i>
<i> She models.</i>

36:54.860 --> 36:57.130
<i> Everybody wants her.</i>

36:57.130 --> 36:59.630
And I had to remember
it's not that they want me.

36:59.630 --> 37:01.030
They want her.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.340
But he didn't deserve
to get strung along

37:03.340 --> 37:04.740
for that long.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.440
I thought that, you know,
he would say,

37:06.440 --> 37:08.210
<i> "You kind of just pop</i>
<i> in and out of my life.</i>

37:08.210 --> 37:10.040
<i> I don't have time</i>
<i> for that instability."</i>

37:10.040 --> 37:12.480
<i> I wanted him to end</i>
<i> the relationship with Nevaeh,</i>

37:12.480 --> 37:14.310
<i> but, you know,</i>
<i> I would go away,</i>

37:14.320 --> 37:15.950
<i> and then when</i>
<i> he would leave a message</i>

37:15.950 --> 37:18.120
<i> I would hear that</i>
<i> sincerity in his voice.</i>

37:18.120 --> 37:20.120
<i> "Are you okay?</i>
<i> I was just checking in on you."</i>

37:20.120 --> 37:21.750
<i> And I'm like, "Okay,</i>
<i> I got to tell him,"</i>

37:21.760 --> 37:23.220
<i> you know,</i>
<i> "that I'm all right."</i>

37:23.220 --> 37:25.930
And so that's why
I let it carry on so long.

37:25.930 --> 37:29.860
It wasn't necessarily
about you.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.430
It was the inner problems
and the inner issues

37:32.430 --> 37:34.670
that I needed to work on

37:34.670 --> 37:37.540
as myself.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.510
I feel like I just lost
my best friend behind this.

37:40.510 --> 37:43.180
And was it worth it?
No.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.880
- There's definitely
no friendship.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.180
You could hit the lottery
for Mega Millions tomorrow,

37:47.180 --> 37:48.880
and I wouldn't give
a [bleep].

37:51.620 --> 37:53.150
- It's--
it's going nowhere.

37:53.150 --> 37:55.120
It's going nowhere.
- Pretty much.

37:55.120 --> 37:58.390
- I said I'm sorry.
That's all I can say.

37:58.390 --> 38:01.160
So, it was nice meeting you.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.700
- Nice to meet you, too.
