WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.235
Only on Fox.

00:04.237 --> 00:07.240
Narrator:
Tonight on "MasterChef"...

00:07.274 --> 00:09.577
Keep your fingers out of there.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.846
...the top 19
face a mystery box...

00:12.880 --> 00:15.415
Oh, my God!

00:15.448 --> 00:17.317
...that's tough to crack.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.419
I do not know how
to cook with them.

00:19.452 --> 00:21.088
And then...

00:21.121 --> 00:23.356
Please welcome one of America's
greatest soccer players.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.158
Alexi Lalas?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.994
Are we playing soccer
or are we cooking over here?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.862
Narrator:
A world-class challenge...

00:28.896 --> 00:31.999
- My God.
- ...with an end...

00:32.032 --> 00:34.735
- What happened?
- ...no one will see coming.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.303
- Are you done?
- ( sighs )

00:45.078 --> 00:47.080
Come on, everyone.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.348
( cheers and applause )

00:48.381 --> 00:50.618
Yes! Top 19!

00:51.985 --> 00:53.353
Yes!

00:53.386 --> 00:55.555
This is so good
to have my apron still.

00:55.589 --> 00:59.526
Back home in Michigan,
I grew up in a family
of four brothers.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.795
( sing-song )
A mystery box!

01:01.829 --> 01:03.530
So, I'm a fighter.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.565
Everyone sees a pretty face
and the hair,

01:05.599 --> 01:08.636
but I've got some big guns
underneath here.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.470
I'm ready to pull 'em out
and I'm giving 'em my all.

01:10.503 --> 01:13.907
You are the 19 most talented,
amateur cooks

01:13.941 --> 01:15.408
from all walks of life.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.646
One of us gave each of you
an apron.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.749
It's on you to prove

01:21.782 --> 01:25.118
which judge identified
America's next MasterChef.

01:25.152 --> 01:28.622
So let's get started with the
iconic mystery box challenge.

01:32.525 --> 01:35.395
Are you ready to find out what's
under your mystery boxes?

01:35.428 --> 01:36.997
All:
Yes, Chef.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.599
The side bits, keep your fingers
out of there for now.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.968
They move quickly.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.403
- You good?
- All: Yes, Chef.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.273
Aarón: Let's do this
on the count of three.

01:46.306 --> 01:51.311
One, two, three.

01:52.545 --> 01:56.116
( screaming, clamoring )

01:56.149 --> 01:57.317
Oh!

01:57.350 --> 01:59.319
- I told you they move.
- Oh, my God.

01:59.352 --> 02:02.455
Stunning California walnuts.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.758
It's a million walnuts!
It's a million of 'em!

02:04.792 --> 02:06.093
Oh, my God!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.095
Walnuts everywhere!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.430
I do not know
how to cook with them.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.867
The Chinese believe walnuts
can make you smarter.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.770
So I hope the walnut
can make me smarter

02:16.804 --> 02:19.472
to get through the competition.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.308
They are packed
with amazing flavor

02:21.341 --> 02:23.143
whether you're roasting them,
candy them,

02:23.176 --> 02:24.978
or even puréeing them.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.814
There are endless
roads to go down.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.117
- It's amazing.
- Joe: You will have 45 minutes

02:30.150 --> 02:33.954
to make us one incredible dish
featuring walnuts.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.023
And the entire MasterChef pantry

02:36.056 --> 02:38.391
is at your disposal
for you to use.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.628
The person with the best dish
in this mystery box challenge

02:41.661 --> 02:43.697
will get the biggest advantage

02:43.731 --> 02:47.400
in the entire competition
so far.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.670
Your 45 minutes...

02:50.704 --> 02:54.474
starts...

02:54.507 --> 02:56.676
...now.
Let's go.

02:56.710 --> 03:00.347
- Oh! Uh--
- Careful, careful, careful.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.482
- Cauliflower, cauliflower.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.384
Oh, my goodness.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.586
Spinach, spinach, spinach,
spinach, spinach.

03:06.619 --> 03:09.356
Walnuts? Give me a pecan.
I'm a Southern guy.

03:09.389 --> 03:10.824
But hey, I know I can put
something together

03:10.858 --> 03:12.392
that'll impress the judges.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.527
So I'm thinking walnuts
with blue cheese

03:14.561 --> 03:16.096
stuffed inside a bacon
wrapped pork chop

03:16.129 --> 03:19.099
with a bourbon
and walnut butter glaze.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.433
Gordon: Let's go.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.938
- So many nuts.
- Hey, Ralph, how's it cracking?

03:26.606 --> 03:27.908
Back home in Michigan
I make this for my husband.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.010
I make brownies for him
all the time.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.579
So, right now I'm making
a dark fudgy brownie

03:32.612 --> 03:35.415
with walnut inside
and walnuts on top.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.517
I'm gonna do this for my family.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.854
I am making a vanilla
and walnut cupcake

03:40.888 --> 03:43.523
with a chocolate
and walnut buttercream.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.259
Hopefully I can pull it off
in 45 minutes.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.728
Mmm! Ain't nothing
wrong with that.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.899
How do you turn
those humble walnuts

03:51.932 --> 03:54.067
into the star of the dish?

03:54.101 --> 03:56.369
And how do you incorporate it
into your dish in a way
that makes sense?

03:56.403 --> 03:59.039
( sighs )
There's so many nuts.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.975
I don't wanna see dishes
that are just carrying walnuts
for the sake of it, right?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.610
- They need to be integrated.
- Aarón: Absolutely.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.416
The skin on that walnut.
They're very bitter.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.984
You need to counteract that.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.285
I think that all
that bitterness,

04:12.319 --> 04:14.387
you wanna have some
fat contrast.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.622
Aarón:
And they can get
a little bit mealy

04:15.655 --> 04:17.257
if you over-marinate them.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.827
Milk's down. Don't cry
over spilled milk.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.762
Well, it's a great challenge
because you could either go
sweet or savory.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.997
It's gonna be really interesting

04:24.031 --> 04:25.398
to see what they put
on the plate

04:25.432 --> 04:27.334
with this very,
very difficult challenge.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.769
I'm super happy that we decided
to use walnuts today.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.638
I really wanna impress
Joe today

04:31.671 --> 04:33.740
because Joe gave me
this apron.

04:33.773 --> 04:38.311
I am making a parmesan Alfredo

04:38.345 --> 04:40.080
with a red wine reduction,

04:40.113 --> 04:41.648
that has grape
and roasted walnuts.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.251
I'm gonna do a crispy
pancetta bacon on top.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.186
I'm not gonna crack
under pressure. Not today.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.389
35 minutes to go, guys.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.426
- I can do it.
- Bowen!

04:53.460 --> 04:55.795
How are you, buddy?
What do you got going on?

04:55.829 --> 04:59.166
So I'm gonna make a pork
shrimp dumpling

04:59.199 --> 05:00.800
with candied walnut,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.270
served with miso stock.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.707
Is it normal to put candied
walnuts in pork dumplings?

05:07.740 --> 05:09.843
No, but I think this
will be good.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.113
So, today I'm gonna
represent myself.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.615
So, I want to make
my country people proud.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.884
- Good luck, Bowen.
- Thank you.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.655
Ashley, a professional grocery
shopper from Florida,

05:22.689 --> 05:24.357
a home cook
that I gave an apron to.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.226
Tell me about the dish.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.562
I'm doing a walnut herb-crusted
cauliflower steak

05:29.596 --> 05:31.698
with a walnut pesto.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.834
- Why no protein?
- They are protein--
they have protein in them.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.203
It's just not a meat protein.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.670
Hold on.
You've gone vegetarian.

05:37.704 --> 05:38.906
I have gone vegetarian.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.473
I am making this dish

05:40.507 --> 05:41.741
because I actually got
my boyfriend excited

05:41.774 --> 05:43.810
about cauliflower
with this dish.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.479
So I really wanted to highlight
the nut and vegetables,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.548
'cause I think
they go hand in hand.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.083
How are those
cauliflower steaks?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.885
- They are tender, Chef.
- They're tender.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.221
I'd like mine
mid-rare, please.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.555
Yes, Chef.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.425
Gordon:
23 minutes remaining.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.193
- Cesar.
- Yes, Joe. How are you?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.428
What's the dish?
What are you making?

06:01.461 --> 06:02.695
I am making pan dulce,

06:02.729 --> 06:04.998
which is Spanish
for "sweet bread,"

06:05.032 --> 06:08.868
but I'm using banana walnut
as my flavoring for the bread,

06:08.902 --> 06:12.039
then I'm gonna make a walnut
cinnamon caramel sauce
to go with it.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.174
This is what's great and what
I appreciate about Cesar

06:14.207 --> 06:16.676
and hy he has one of my aprons,
'cause he's not gonna go

06:16.709 --> 06:19.079
for something savory.
He's gonna go big
with a pan dulce,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.547
and show off his baking skills.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.949
But here's the deal,
Cesar.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.951
Did you bite off more
than you can chew?

06:23.984 --> 06:25.285
I don't think so, Chef.
I'll be ready.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.054
- Joe: Good luck.
- Thank you.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.357
- Samantha.
- Yes.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
- Pesto?
- Yes.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.628
I'm gonna be making a potato
gnocchi with a walnut pesto.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.464
You're gonna make gnocchi
for Joe Bastianich?

06:37.497 --> 06:38.932
Yes.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.434
If you have the confidence
at 20 years old

06:41.468 --> 06:44.771
to whip out gnocchi
in a 45 minute
mystery box then--

06:44.804 --> 06:47.307
- Good luck. Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.409
12 minutes remaining.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.611
Use your time wisely.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.583
An amazing mix
of incredible dishes.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.952
Aarón:
Guys, if I could boast
a little bit,

06:58.986 --> 07:01.321
all of the people that I have
given my aprons are still here,

07:01.354 --> 07:03.290
- battling it out...
- Here we go.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.326
...showing that they can be
America's next MasterChef.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.962
I don't mean to toot
my own horn, but I'm ecstatic

07:08.996 --> 07:12.232
- that I still have all
my eight aprons intact.
- It's delicious.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.169
Okay. I've got five left,
but at least those five,

07:16.203 --> 07:18.972
I can concentrate
on my strongest cooks.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.473
You know it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.275
- Aarón: It's true.
- I happen to have six.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.577
I don't know
who's gonna win or lose,

07:24.611 --> 07:26.980
but I know that among those
are three finalists.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.482
So, Aarón, the fact that you
have all your mentees left

07:29.516 --> 07:31.351
is completely circumstantial.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.121
One minute 45 seconds to go.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.489
- We need to start plating.
- Come on, come on, come on!

07:36.523 --> 07:38.591
Love it. I love it.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.128
Come on, Cesar.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.363
Gordon:
One minute to go. Come on!

07:43.396 --> 07:46.166
Come on, Taylor.
Show some finesse.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.135
- Aarón: Let's push, Ralph.
- Oh, my God, it's coming
down to the wire.

07:48.168 --> 07:52.039
Judges: Ten, nine, eight, seven,

07:52.072 --> 07:56.509
six, five, four, three,

07:56.543 --> 07:58.845
- two, one.
- Gordon: And stop.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.113
Hands in the air.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.748
Well done.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.558
Now, tonight, you were each
given a single ingredient,

08:11.591 --> 08:15.195
the humble California walnut.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.197
Joe: And now we've watched you
all cook,

08:17.230 --> 08:20.800
and we've tasted elements
of every single dish.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.370
And there are three dishes
that we are so excited,

08:23.403 --> 08:25.972
we cannot wait to try.

08:26.005 --> 08:30.009
The first home cook
utilized two proteins,

08:30.043 --> 08:33.080
and candied walnuts as well,

08:33.113 --> 08:35.982
and being mentored by myself.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.185
Please step forward...

08:40.387 --> 08:41.588
Bowen.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.190
Let's go.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.526
Bowen:
Oh, my God!

08:46.559 --> 08:48.261
That feeling is so great.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.696
You just fly into the heaven.

08:49.729 --> 08:52.199
I truly have faith in myself,

08:52.232 --> 08:55.202
because I am the strongest man
in the competition.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.370
Okay, young man,
describe the dish, please.

08:57.404 --> 09:01.374
Bowen:
I made pork shrimp
candied walnut dumplings

09:01.408 --> 09:04.444
with miso chicken stock.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.113
In China,
dumplings symbol good luck,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.115
but walnuts symbol
long life.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.550
This plate is lucky.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.719
The miso broth, yeah,
we could smell it from here,

09:12.752 --> 09:15.388
smelling incredibly delicious.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.091
I saw the way you were making
the pasta by hand,

09:18.125 --> 09:19.959
and it was beautiful to watch.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.561
In China we're always
using by hand,

09:21.594 --> 09:23.696
so I think makes it
more tasty.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.298
You can taste the texture.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.400
You're quite a technician,
aren't you?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.769
You got the dumpling,
you got the shrimp, the apple.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.471
They've got that crunch
running through.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.739
Of course
that's the candied walnuts.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.274
And then you made pasta as well.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.209
That's what
this competition is all about.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.445
- There's no stopping you,
is there?
- No.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.148
The broth needs to be
a little bit less thick,

09:41.181 --> 09:42.449
'cause it's quite strong.

09:42.482 --> 09:43.750
But it's a really good dish.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.218
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.919
I'm a little bit confused,
Bowen.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.921
Is this an Italian
pasta dish

09:48.955 --> 09:50.723
or a Chinese dumpling dish?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.625
A Chinese pasta dish.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.227
There's no pasta in China.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.963
Okay, it's dumpling wrapper.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.298
- Joe: Dumpling wrapper.
- Bowen: How about this?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.400
So this is like a fusion.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.968
Yes.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.672
The filling, I love it.
I love the crunchy bits.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.274
I love the miso soup.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.142
The only thing I would say,

10:09.176 --> 10:12.612
is this thing is completely
not relevant.

10:12.645 --> 10:16.916
I love the use of the walnut
inside the ravioli.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.618
- Your dish is very, very good.
- Thank you.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.487
Good job.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.092
Aarón: The next dish
that we want to examine further

10:26.125 --> 10:28.361
featured no meat in the dish.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.863
This person took a lot of risk

10:30.897 --> 10:33.366
considering the 45 minute
time limit.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.135
Please step forward...

10:36.169 --> 10:37.970
Samantha.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.209
I'm ecstatic right now.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.978
My love for Italian food
comes from my dad

10:46.012 --> 10:48.848
and this is just reassuring
that what I do,

10:48.881 --> 10:51.318
and, like, the risks I take
are worth it.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.019
Today I have for you

10:53.052 --> 10:56.556
a potato gnocchi with
a walnut pesto sauce.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.824
I love pesto.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.526
I grew a bunch of basil
this summer,

10:59.559 --> 11:01.994
and just made a ton
of pesto sauce.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.464
So you substituted the walnut
in lieu of the pine nuts
traditionally.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.965
- Right?
- Correct.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.334
Pine nuts are usually
a bit creamy.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.803
I got the same effect
from the walnuts,

11:10.837 --> 11:12.572
so that's why I went
with that route.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.341
The flavor's there.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.510
Those walnuts work beautifully
with the floral basil,

11:17.544 --> 11:19.979
and then the gnocchi are just
light, puffy, and airy.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.748
You didn't fall
into the trap

11:21.781 --> 11:23.015
of adding too many
other ingredients.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.584
If you go to Italy,

11:24.617 --> 11:25.918
the pastas don't have all
that frilly stuff.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.254
So I think you stayed true

11:27.287 --> 11:28.821
to the essence of true
Italian pasta

11:28.855 --> 11:30.857
by doing it this way.
You just need more.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.759
- All right. Thank you.
- Great job.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.999
Dish is delicious.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.834
Your gnocchi's got
an amazing flavor.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.337
Crisp on the outside,
light and fluffy
in the center.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.940
That walnut pesto
just makes it elevated.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.243
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Visually, it didn't have
that wow factor.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.279
But you're only 20 years of age,

11:52.312 --> 11:53.846
and you've nailed the gnocchi.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.815
- Great job. Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.920
Joe:
Those gnocchi were perfect.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.860
The last choice was very,
very difficult.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.731
But this cook took a big risk

12:11.764 --> 12:14.467
making a sweet treat.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.204
Please step forward, Cesar.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.373
( whispers )
Yes!

12:20.407 --> 12:21.941
I'm doing a secret fist bump

12:21.974 --> 12:24.911
in the air
because this dish symbolizes

12:24.944 --> 12:29.248
both my Mexican heritage
with my American upbringing.

12:29.282 --> 12:33.219
So, I'm a mixture of many things
and produces one amazing thing.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.221
Okay, Cesar,
tell me about it.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.490
I tried recreating pan dulce.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.592
It's banana, it's walnut.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.595
In the bottom I did crème
fraîche with citrus and basil

12:42.629 --> 12:44.897
to balance the walnut.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.599
But instead of using sour cream
for my moisture,

12:46.633 --> 12:48.067
I grated an ear of corn,

12:48.100 --> 12:50.803
and all that milk
that comes from grating the corn

12:50.837 --> 12:53.473
- I folded that in to my batter
so it'll give it moisture.
- Wow!

12:53.506 --> 12:55.575
That's an interesting technique.
Where did you learn that?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.611
I had a recipe
that included sour cream,

12:58.645 --> 13:00.747
and one day I said,
"What if I take away
the sour cream

13:00.780 --> 13:03.015
and use corn milk?"
And that's where that came from.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.517
You taste the banana,

13:04.551 --> 13:06.018
taste the walnuts.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.687
Sour cream sauce
is delicious.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.988
Gives it a tang.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.823
Your caramel sauce
is complex.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.493
And all three
kind of work together,

13:13.526 --> 13:16.028
and almost give me
a sense of eating a real
restaurant dessert.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.498
If I had to maybe
suggest one thing,

13:18.531 --> 13:21.133
maybe a little sprig
of something green,

13:21.167 --> 13:22.869
- Right.
- just to make it pop a little
bit more aesthetically,

13:22.902 --> 13:24.270
but really delicious.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.538
- Good job.
- Okay. Thank you.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.709
Cesar, como estas?

13:29.742 --> 13:32.545
- Bien bien.
- Que bueno.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.113
What I'm most impressed
about is your finesse

13:34.146 --> 13:36.148
with your presentation.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.150
Do you cook with this much
finesse at home
every day like this?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.219
I'm a high school teacher,
but when I have breaks

13:40.252 --> 13:42.522
I like to do taco tastings
out of my apartment,

13:42.555 --> 13:45.858
and I apply the same finesse
that I do here.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.698
- This dish right here
has it all.
- Thank you.

13:51.731 --> 13:55.034
Creaminess. It has richness
'cause of the caramel sauce.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.203
The cake is moist.
That's really spectacular.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.971
- Thank you.
- What would I do different?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.507
Citrus salsa on top,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.074
just to break down
some of that richness.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.376
But I'm proud
I gave you that pin.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.011
- Thank you.
- Sigues adelante.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.579
- Will do.
- All right, you'll do me proud.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.086
- ( indistinct chatter )
- Yeah.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.388
You're right.
But it's very good.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.694
Wow!
What a night.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.163
Bowen, Samantha, Cesar,
well done.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.534
Each one of those dishes
highlighted your culinary styles

14:27.567 --> 14:28.835
in a beautiful way,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
but there only
could be one winner.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.472
and you know that.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.108
And that winner is...

14:44.617 --> 14:46.553
Aarón:
Three amazing dishes,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.421
each showcasing
the mystery box ingredient,

14:48.455 --> 14:50.890
which are walnuts.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.926
But there only could be
one winner,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.729
that home cook that will get
an unreal advantage

14:56.763 --> 15:00.800
in the upcoming elimination
challenge.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.402
And that winner is...

15:03.436 --> 15:05.938
Cesar.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.740
Yes!

15:09.809 --> 15:10.943
Cesar, congratulations.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.779
Yeah, Cesar!

15:12.812 --> 15:14.714
Extremely proud of you 'cause
you have one of my aprons.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.084
And with that, why don't you
join us in the pantry?

15:18.117 --> 15:20.052
I can't believe
that something I do as a hobby

15:20.086 --> 15:24.123
in my one-bedroom apartment was
just validated by the judges.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.125
It's the greatest culinary
moment of my life.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.365
- Cesar.
- Hey! How's it going, Joe?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.237
- Hola!
- Ah, nice!

15:38.270 --> 15:39.506
Forza Azzurri. Huh?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.608
- What do you think?
- ( laughs )

15:41.641 --> 15:43.510
- Numero uno.
- Bastianich.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.978
I love it.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.514
- Look at that.
- Come on.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.283
- Viva Méjico! Whoo!
- Oh, Sanchez.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.686
- Nice. Loving it.
- It's all about Méjico.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.125
This is what a real
soccer kit looks like.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.729
Bonnie Scotland.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.832
There you go. Come on.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.133
Ramsay. There you go.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.536
- Love it.
- All right.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.270
Soccer is the most popular
sport in the world,

16:11.303 --> 16:12.972
and this year is a special one.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.642
It's a World Cup year
and FOX is bringing America

16:15.675 --> 16:17.143
all the World Cup coverage.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.045
But unlike these two poor lads,

16:19.078 --> 16:21.514
my team is actually
in the World Cup.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.850
That's right. Méjico.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.351
Now, your first
big advantage tonight

16:25.384 --> 16:27.319
for winning that mystery box
challenge is...

16:27.353 --> 16:28.855
you are safe.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.824
Joe:
Here's your second
advantage.

16:31.858 --> 16:35.127
You get to choose
what everyone else
will be cooking

16:35.161 --> 16:37.697
- in this elimination test.
- All right.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.031
And when you go
to a soccer game,

16:39.065 --> 16:40.499
no matter what country
you're in,

16:40.533 --> 16:43.035
there's always amazing
street food.

16:43.069 --> 16:47.506
Roma, Milano, Naples
are full with amazing
Italian street food.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.543
And one of my favorites is...

16:50.577 --> 16:52.845
pizza fritta.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.080
Okay.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.916
Fried pizza filled with tomato,

16:56.949 --> 16:59.385
ricotta, salame piccante.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.388
Gooey cheese on the inside,
crispy on the outside.

17:02.421 --> 17:05.024
It's quite difficult to do,
because everyone knows pizza,

17:05.057 --> 17:08.194
but pizza fritta not many people
in this country know about.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.762
In Mexico on match day,

17:09.796 --> 17:12.531
one of my favorite things to eat
on the way to the game,

17:12.565 --> 17:14.166
churros con chocolate.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.002
- Yes!
- They're beautiful.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.671
They're dusted with a wonderful
canela sugar on the outside.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.006
You gotta make pâte à choux.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.941
You have to put it
in the piping bag,

17:21.974 --> 17:23.375
then as you're frying them
you cut 'em with the scissors.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.177
There's a lot
of technique involved,

17:25.211 --> 17:28.547
that señoras all over Méjico
take years to master.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.250
When I'm walking
through the streets of Glasgow

17:31.283 --> 17:32.685
on the way to the game,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.787
there's only one thing
that I grab.

17:34.821 --> 17:38.457
A big, juicy...

17:38.490 --> 17:39.792
...burger.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.094
The intricacy of a beef patty.

17:42.128 --> 17:45.031
Hot, seasoned,
and more importantly, layered

17:45.064 --> 17:48.735
with caramelized onions, cheese,
ketchup, and that bun.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.403
So, as a competitor,

17:51.437 --> 17:54.073
you want to eliminate
the competition,

17:54.106 --> 17:57.209
putting the best cooks
in difficulty.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.579
And this is a decision that
can help you achieve that goal.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.882
Gordon:
Which dish do you want

18:02.915 --> 18:05.885
those talented cooks to make
for us this evening?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.586
Um...

18:10.256 --> 18:11.457
I-- I'm gonna go with...

18:13.760 --> 18:14.994
um--

18:17.830 --> 18:20.066
- Oh...
- What is this?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.434
- What is this?
- Off you go, Cesar.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.005
Aarón: This year
it's a World Cup year,

18:26.038 --> 18:28.140
and come on, guys,
how do you like these kits?

18:28.174 --> 18:30.442
- Awesome!
- Super fly!

18:30.476 --> 18:32.311
For winning the mystery box
challenge,

18:32.344 --> 18:37.750
Cesar got to decide what
everyone else here has to cook.

18:37.784 --> 18:42.955
- Sorry, guys.
- Now, the next challenge is
an elimination challenge.

18:42.989 --> 18:47.660
At least one home cook will be
leaving the MasterChef kitchen

18:47.694 --> 18:49.762
after this next challenge.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.965
Gordon: Right.
The dish you'll all
have to cook tonight

18:52.999 --> 18:56.335
is being delivered
by a very special guest.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.837
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.473
He has been to two World Cups.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.810
He played for the U.S.
Olympic team,

19:03.843 --> 19:07.479
and he is in the U.S. Soccer
Hall of Fame.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.181
Ooh!

19:09.215 --> 19:13.786
One of America's most incredible
soccer players ever.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.856
Please welcome...

19:16.889 --> 19:18.825
Alexi Lalas!

19:18.858 --> 19:20.326
- Ooh, no way!
- ( cheers and applause )

19:20.359 --> 19:22.895
- Hello there.
- Good to see you. Please.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.230
Alexi Lalas is here?

19:24.263 --> 19:25.497
How exciting is this?

19:25.531 --> 19:27.133
Why is he here?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.567
Are we playing soccer
or are we cooking over here?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.669
- Good to see you.
- Look at you guys.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.171
Damn sexy!
Look at those legs!

19:32.204 --> 19:33.706
- Huh?
- Whoo!

19:33.740 --> 19:35.541
Whoo!

19:35.574 --> 19:37.043
- Good to see you, sir.
- Thank you! Thank you
for having me.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.078
Now you've got a very,
very busy summer.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.247
Big summer for soccer,
big summer for FOX.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.316
- We're going to bring you
the World Cup.
- Yes!

19:44.350 --> 19:47.019
All of the players, all of the
teams, all of the storylines,

19:47.053 --> 19:48.921
and bringing everybody together
in celebration

19:48.955 --> 19:50.522
of the greatest game
in the world.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.091
Amazing, amazing.
Right, Alexi.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.427
Would you please let these
talented home cooks know

19:55.461 --> 19:57.830
what they're gonna
have to nail this evening

19:57.864 --> 20:00.332
- to stay in this competition.
- You got it.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.469
Your dish tonight is...

20:06.973 --> 20:09.341
churros with chocolate sauce.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.211
- Oh, God.
- ( exhales )

20:12.244 --> 20:14.947
Gordon:
Cesar, give us an insight to why
you picked churros this evening.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.716
Cesar: Because they seem
like a simple dish,

20:17.750 --> 20:21.087
and people might have
a false sense of confidence
by seeing the churros there,

20:21.120 --> 20:23.790
'cause not all of them
are gonna come out the way
they should come out.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.191
Are you targeting anyone
in particular?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.725
I kind of picked this
for Bowen.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.528
He's the strongest,
plating is beautiful.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.964
I know he has an excellent
Asian palate,

20:31.998 --> 20:34.767
but I wanna know if he can step
out of that zone

20:34.801 --> 20:37.303
- and cook other cuisines.
- Wow!

20:37.336 --> 20:39.772
Bowen:
I'm really mad at Cesar,

20:39.806 --> 20:41.908
because he wants to use
his advantage

20:41.941 --> 20:44.043
to send me home.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.411
But I'm not chicken.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.814
I'm ready for it.
Let's compete.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.082
- All right, Cesar,
- Yes, Alexi.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.651
There are 11 players
on a soccer team, right?

20:52.684 --> 20:55.154
- True.
- So for your next advantage,

20:55.187 --> 20:58.457
I am making you captain
of your own soccer team.

20:58.490 --> 21:02.261
As a team captain, you'll get
to pick ten contestants

21:02.294 --> 21:04.296
to join you in safety up
on the balcony.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.766
Ten?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.169
Wow! Another advantage?

21:10.202 --> 21:11.770
For my first choice

21:11.804 --> 21:14.406
I decided to pick cooks
who excel in baking.

21:14.440 --> 21:20.246
Chelsea, Ashley, Emily.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.181
I'm thinking, "What's the point
of making them go through this

21:22.214 --> 21:25.517
if I know they have the ability
to cook their way out of it?"

21:25.551 --> 21:26.919
Interesting.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.320
Then I choose to save people

21:28.354 --> 21:30.156
that are excellent
team players.

21:30.189 --> 21:31.757
- S.J.
- Gordon: S.J.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.026
- Ralph.
- Gordon: Ralph.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.862
Farhan, Gerron.

21:35.895 --> 21:39.131
And earning the respect of some
of the stronger cooks

21:39.165 --> 21:40.833
will also be an advantage
for myself.

21:40.867 --> 21:44.036
- Ryan, Lindsay.
- Gordon: Wow!

21:44.070 --> 21:46.338
- Last but not least.
- Young Mark.

21:46.372 --> 21:49.041
Joe:
Come on up, Mark.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.510
All right, Cesar,
very interesting picks.

21:51.543 --> 21:54.480
And Alexi, that completes
your time here in the
MasterChef kitchen.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.182
And I know
we'll see lots of you
across the summer.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.816
Alexi:
I can't wait for this summer.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.351
I hope you guys join us on FOX

21:59.385 --> 22:02.321
for what is going to be
a spectacular World Cup.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.690
And I can't wait
to bring it all to you.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.058
It's been an absolute
pleasure having you here in
the MasterChef kitchen.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.826
Thank you so much.
Good luck to everybody here.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.295
- Thank you!
- Thank you, guys.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.629
( cheers and applause )

22:10.662 --> 22:12.198
Thank you!

22:13.432 --> 22:14.700
Thank you.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.670
All right,
so back to business now, guys.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.672
You eight are about to cook
for your lives.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.543
Now, you will have
just 30 minutes

22:24.576 --> 22:30.316
to cook us some delicious
churros with chocolate sauce.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.818
- Is everybody ready?
- All: Yes.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.021
Your time starts...

22:35.054 --> 22:36.355
...now.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.024
- Come on, guys!
- Come on.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.893
- Run!
- Run, run, run! Hurry!

22:44.263 --> 22:46.865
( whispers )
Gosh, I'm shaking.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.767
I'm not sure what this is.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.937
I don't have a ton of
experience in making churros,

22:50.970 --> 22:52.571
but honestly,
I'm not nervous

22:52.604 --> 22:54.273
because I'm just sticking it
in a fryer.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.208
Very similar to making a donut.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.177
Of course I made donuts before.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.212
In my dad's restaurant that's
all we did was make the donuts.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.480
Do they have a banana?

23:03.983 --> 23:05.784
( whispers )
Oh, come on, guys.
You got this.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.190
Right, 30 minutes, churros.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.625
What is the A to Z of churros?

23:13.659 --> 23:15.094
It is one of the most
challenging things to make.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.562
I don't put 'em
on my restaurant menus

23:16.595 --> 23:17.896
unless I have the right talent

23:17.930 --> 23:19.698
to be able to execute them
properly.

23:19.731 --> 23:20.866
The original dough,
it's like a pâte à choux.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.401
It's a choux pastry dough.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.970
Aarón:
You have to mix in that water,

23:24.003 --> 23:25.871
add your flour,
continue to work it,

23:25.904 --> 23:28.040
and at the end,
add your eggs.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.376
Right. Crack eggs into it,
which actually makes it spin it,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.111
aerates it, and
it just creates a little bit

23:32.144 --> 23:33.812
of that even distribution
of the eggs.

23:33.845 --> 23:35.881
So, crisp on the outside,
light and spongy in the middle.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.283
Tell me
about the chocolate sauce.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.385
Well, it's essentially
just chocolate,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.420
Mexican cinnamon,
put it in a double boiler,

23:41.453 --> 23:43.322
and add heavy cream
and make a quick little sauce.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.624
Gordon:
23 minutes remaining.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.426
We have to speed up.

23:47.459 --> 23:49.328
Double boiler on,
get your chocolate melting

23:49.361 --> 23:51.697
as you're making
your pâte à choux.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.403
Whip it, Alecia.
I see you, girl.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.471
I'm coming up there, y'all.

23:59.505 --> 24:01.107
Supposed to be up there
with team Aarón.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.342
We haven't lost
an apron yet.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.245
We ain't gonna lose
an apron today.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.814
- Come on, Tay.
- Making sure
I get my chocolate going,

24:08.847 --> 24:10.749
'cause it started a little late.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.284
Taylor, this is
'cause I know
you're gonna pass.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.752
You can build confidence.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.121
Shoot.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.956
Oh, my gosh.
It's just broken.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.591
- Her sauce looks terrible.
- It's way too thick.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.793
Any tips
to thin it out, Chef?

24:21.827 --> 24:23.429
- Do you have any more
chocolate?
- No.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.963
I think she's really
falling apart.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.633
- I don't know what to do.
- Gordon: Quick.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.435
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.836
Shoot!

24:30.869 --> 24:32.338
She's got me worried.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.347
Taylor:
I don't know what to do.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.614
Gordon: Quick.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.383
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

24:44.416 --> 24:45.984
Shoot!

24:46.018 --> 24:50.022
It is a treat to watch other
contestants struggle

24:50.056 --> 24:52.324
with a dish that has followed me
since my childhood.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.193
- Chelsea: Come on, Taylor!
- Let's go.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.727
Get some more melted
chocolate on there.

24:55.761 --> 24:57.696
- Can I borrow some chocolate?
- Oh, yeah. Here.

24:57.729 --> 24:59.965
- Hazelnut?
You want dark chocolate?
- Thank you so much.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.367
Nice team player, Julia.
That's awesome.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.402
Here's more milk chocolate.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.737
- Thank you.
- It's okay, Taylor.
You're doing good.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.005
Taylor:
It's a chocolate sauce.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.507
Why is this so difficult?

25:08.540 --> 25:11.009
I started over and now

25:11.043 --> 25:14.146
what matters is making a perfect
churro for these judges,

25:14.180 --> 25:17.049
and that's what I have
to keep focused on.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.088
Right. Samantha.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.056
Churros.
Have you made them before?

25:24.090 --> 25:25.924
- No, Chef. No, I haven't. No.
- You've never made 'em before?

25:25.957 --> 25:27.993
- You are adding the eggs
in by hand.
- Yep.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.028
Why are you doing this
the hard way?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.497
This is the way I've done
pâte à choux in the past,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.732
so I'm confident
that I can do it again.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.667
Is this the last time cooking
inside the MasterChef kitchen?

25:35.701 --> 25:37.736
- No, Chef, it is not.
- Don't let me down.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.405
I do not want you
going home tonight.

25:39.438 --> 25:40.772
- Nail it. Good luck.
- Thank you. Thank you, Chef.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.110
- Bowen!
- Hi.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.577
Now, Cesar is your friend,
right?

25:45.611 --> 25:46.912
Kind of is my friend.

25:46.945 --> 25:48.447
- Yes.
- Kind of?
Why are you down here?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.781
He want me to go home.
He's scared of me!

25:49.815 --> 25:52.251
He want me to lose.
He want me to go home.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.253
- So he can win the competition.
No way.
- Okay.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.455
So, China, a big culture
of frying food.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.225
What's the closest thing you
have in China to a churro?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.260
- Fried salty dough. Yes.
- Salty dough?

26:01.293 --> 26:04.730
We eat breakfast
with fried salty dough
every morning.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.765
So, I think
I will knock this out.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.067
- Bowen, best of luck. Okay?
- Okay.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.737
Come on, Matt dog.
You got this.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.972
- Matt, how we doing?
- Chef Ramsay. Good.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.907
- I think we're on time here.
- Have you made churros before?

26:15.941 --> 26:18.577
I never made churros before.
I made pâte à choux before.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.446
So, I made, you know, éclairs
and things like that.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.414
- Good. Have you got this?
- I got this. A hundred percent.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.550
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.985
Guys, 15 minutes gone,
15 minutes to go.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.488
- Okay, Alecia.
- Como estas?

26:29.521 --> 26:32.057
- Muy bien. So have you made
churros before? You have?
- Yes. I have.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.925
I made churros right before
I came here for my daycare kids.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.328
Why did Cesar leave you
down here?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.930
Everybody has seen me
in the first elimination.

26:38.964 --> 26:41.099
So, I'm labeled as
the underdog of the group.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.068
One of you eight is gonna
be eliminated.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.636
- Yes, not me. It's not me, Joe.
Not today.
- At least one of you.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.472
- All right.
- All right.

26:46.505 --> 26:47.773
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.077
Everybody thinks
I'm going home tonight.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.945
You're not, Bowen.
You gotta have the faith.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.147
- You got this, Bowen.
You're not.
- You got it.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.618
She was way late to start
on that dough.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.154
Oil's nice and hot.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.522
I gotta make this for Joe.

27:03.555 --> 27:06.325
I need him to know
that I am here to stay.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.794
Juni, those look perfect!

27:08.827 --> 27:11.330
I better execute these churros
to perfection,

27:11.363 --> 27:13.899
otherwise my Mexican card
is gonna be revoked.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.668
Wow! Tough one, this one.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.337
I'm really worried
about Samantha,

27:18.370 --> 27:20.672
'cause she made
the pâte à choux by hand.

27:20.706 --> 27:23.108
- Oh.
- And so her mix is very pale,
very thick.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.976
So, Shanika is in the back
and she's actually
adding peanut butter

27:25.010 --> 27:26.812
- to her chocolate sauce...
- Joe: Yeah.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.847
- Gordon: Wow!
- ...which I think could
be spectacular

27:28.880 --> 27:31.016
- if done in the right ratio.
- Joe: Risky.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.319
All right, guys,
two minutes left.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.355
- I'm coming up there.
- I know you'll be up here.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.157
- I think Alecia's showboating.
- Yes. We don't need
to do that.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.194
Aarón:
All you're doing is beating
those things out.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.563
60 seconds remaining.
Come on.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.632
Focus, please.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.034
- Bowen's churros look
like churro nuggets.
- Mm-hmm.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.172
- Coming out hot.
- Looks good, Matt. Looks good.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.674
Come on, guys.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.376
Ten, nine...

27:57.409 --> 27:59.845
Judges: Eight, seven, six,

27:59.878 --> 28:04.850
five, four, three, two, one,
and stop.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.518
- Well done.
- Nice!

28:06.552 --> 28:09.655
- Yes!
- ( applause )

28:09.688 --> 28:13.191
Right, it's time to find out
who has made their last dish.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.093
Let's start with Taylor, please.

28:15.126 --> 28:16.828
- Come on, Taylor.
- Gerron: Come on, Tay.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.397
I am so disappointed.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.999
I know churros are the star
of the dish,

28:21.032 --> 28:24.069
but the dish is churros
and a chocolate sauce.

28:24.102 --> 28:28.106
I just really wanted to serve
a beautiful, perfect dish

28:28.139 --> 28:31.076
to make Gordon Ramsay proud of
me that I am wearing his pin.

28:31.109 --> 28:34.112
Taylor, how did
those 30 minutes feel for you?

28:34.145 --> 28:36.848
I felt different
at every moment.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.584
These are not easy
to master.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.419
- There's a lot
of intricacy involved.
- Mm-hmm.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.788
- There's a lot of skill,
timing.
- Yes.

28:42.821 --> 28:46.858
- How do you feel you did?
- I think I did well
on the churros.

28:46.892 --> 28:50.596
I've made them once and they
really weren't that great,

28:50.629 --> 28:52.598
but I think
that I did a good job.

28:52.631 --> 28:55.267
So, when I crack this open,
what are you hoping to see?

28:55.301 --> 28:57.235
I'm hoping it stays crispy
on the outside,

28:57.269 --> 29:00.272
and it's nice and soft
on the inside.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.345
- Mm-mm! Beautiful!
- Thank you, Chef.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.982
Mmm. It's brown
on the outside,

29:11.016 --> 29:13.151
but soft to melt
in your mouth.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.721
You didn't go overboard
with the cinnamon coating
and the sugar.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.389
I know that
you were stressing
a little bit

29:17.423 --> 29:19.057
with the chocolate sauce.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.828
I think the actual flavor
of the sauce is delicious.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.963
I think you were melting
that chocolate with
too much high heat.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.632
- Absolutely.
- Okay, but overall,

29:26.665 --> 29:28.600
I think the importance
lies in the churro.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.770
Great color, flavor's there,
well-balanced.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.138
You didn't go crazy
with the sugar
and the cinnamon.

29:33.171 --> 29:36.107
- I like that.
- Thank you, Chef.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.976
- Hi, Taylor.
- Hey, Joe.

29:38.009 --> 29:40.011
Okay, so these look nice
and light on the inside.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.947
They seem
to be well fried.

29:46.217 --> 29:48.119
- Very, very good.
- Thank you.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.522
- And your chocolate broke.
- Yes.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.458
What's on top?
Is that little
chocolate chips?

29:52.491 --> 29:55.293
Yep, I put some hazelnut
chocolate chips,

29:55.327 --> 29:56.795
some orange zest as well.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.164
Well, pretty good together.

29:59.197 --> 30:00.766
Thank you, Joe.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.868
Your churros are really good.
Crispy, soft.

30:02.901 --> 30:05.036
- It's a good effort.
- Thank you.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.005
- Good job, Taylor.
- Yeah, Taylor.

30:07.038 --> 30:08.940
Gerron:
Way to go, Tay.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.342
Gordon: Bowen.

30:10.376 --> 30:13.144
( applause )

30:13.178 --> 30:14.613
Bowen:
In China the churro

30:14.646 --> 30:16.014
is not really common,

30:16.047 --> 30:17.549
but I'm not scared,

30:17.583 --> 30:20.352
because my cooking skill
and my passion,

30:20.386 --> 30:22.621
can overcome everything.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.856
I want to show Cesar what I got.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.494
Okay, young man.

30:38.704 --> 30:42.708
Bowen, I was excited
when I tasted your food
to begin with

30:42.741 --> 30:46.344
and I gave you that apron,
but what happened?

30:48.747 --> 30:49.981
I double fried it.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.851
In China we eat salty,
fried dough,

30:52.884 --> 30:56.187
and we have to double fry it
to make it actually crispy,

30:56.221 --> 30:58.724
but I don't think
that's the right way
to fry this.

30:58.757 --> 31:02.461
We never cook churros twice.
Never.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.096
- Cesar.
- Chef.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.032
Your number one target
tonight was who?

31:07.065 --> 31:09.100
- Bowen.
- Why?

31:09.134 --> 31:11.603
I was positive
he's a surefire to top three.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.105
Are you telling me now,
young man,

31:14.139 --> 31:17.342
that this is the most talented
individual in this competition

31:17.375 --> 31:19.244
that you're worried about?

31:19.277 --> 31:22.414
- Yes.
- And you are minutes away
from sending him home.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.263
Cesar, you are minutes away
from sending him home.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.636
( sighs )

31:50.308 --> 31:53.411
The churros actually
don't taste as bad
as they look.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.813
They are crispy.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.616
The inside tastes nice.
I'm amazed.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.985
You've got an even distribution
of the sugar.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.153
The sauce is delicious,

32:02.187 --> 32:04.155
but this is
your worst performance.

32:04.189 --> 32:06.825
- Thank you.
- Head up, Bowen.

32:11.429 --> 32:14.600
The next home cook
has Joe's apron.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.803
- Please step forward, Shanika.
- ( cheers and applause )

32:20.305 --> 32:21.807
How do you feel you did
with the churros?

32:21.840 --> 32:23.341
I feel I did pretty good.

32:23.374 --> 32:25.310
I coated them
with cinnamon and sugar,

32:25.343 --> 32:27.345
and the chocolate sauce
has peanut butter.

32:29.981 --> 32:32.017
There is some issues.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.485
Had you fried them
a little bit more,

32:33.519 --> 32:35.120
and allowed that pâte à choux
to cook,

32:35.153 --> 32:36.922
maybe we could've got away
with some of that raw flavor

32:36.955 --> 32:38.757
of the actual inside,

32:38.790 --> 32:41.627
but because of the lack of the
eggs being incorporated well,

32:41.660 --> 32:44.262
it's almost stunting that
process from happening.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.764
I don't know if you're gonna
stay in this competition,

32:45.797 --> 32:48.500
- till I taste everybody else's.
- Gotcha, Chef.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.704
- Next up, Julia.
- Lindsay: Yeah, Julia!

32:52.738 --> 32:55.941
( cheers and applause )

32:55.974 --> 32:58.309
Julia, describe your churros.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.111
I made a traditional churro,

33:00.145 --> 33:02.614
and then I have
a chocolate espresso,

33:02.648 --> 33:04.883
vanilla, chocolate sauce,
and raspberry whipped cream.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.019
I love the size, 'cause you feel
like you got a decent portion.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.921
I just wish they had a little
bit more color on there.

33:11.890 --> 33:15.226
- Wow! Churros taste delicious.
- Thank you.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.195
Nice crunch on the outside,
sauce is delicious.

33:17.228 --> 33:19.164
Good job.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.499
Joe:
The next home cook,

33:21.533 --> 33:23.669
- Juni!
- ( cheers and applause )

33:25.571 --> 33:27.706
So, let's talk
about these churros.

33:27.739 --> 33:30.141
So, you have
a vanilla churro,

33:30.175 --> 33:34.412
and an Ancho chili,
Abuelita chocolate
inspired sauce.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.247
So, small. It's a whole
other take on 'em,

33:36.281 --> 33:38.584
but the color
I think is pretty textbook.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.921
That's good.
Being so small

33:42.954 --> 33:44.656
I thought they'd be hard
and crunchy. They're not.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.392
They're perfectly crispy
and soft on the inside as well.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.595
You can tell
your Mexican compadres

33:49.628 --> 33:51.730
- sometimes good things come
in small packages.
- Good job, Juni.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.666
- All right, Juni.
- Aarón: The next churros
that we wanna taste,

33:54.700 --> 33:57.703
- Matt, please come down.
- Come on, Matt.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.839
I made a simple cinnamon
and sugar churro

34:00.872 --> 34:03.008
- with a chocolate ganache.
- Are you happy with the cook?

34:03.041 --> 34:04.242
Do you feel like
it's consistent?

34:04.275 --> 34:06.912
I think the cook is consistent.

34:06.945 --> 34:09.447
Here's what I love.
The color, spot-on.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.684
You did a great job evenly
disbursing the cinnamon
and the sugar.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.119
The chocolate sauce is good.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.187
I think you need more
heavy cream in that.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.690
It settled,
but the churros, good job.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.925
Thank you, Chef.
I appreciate it.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.993
- Way to go, Matt.
- Dude!

34:23.128 --> 34:24.896
Next up, please,

34:24.930 --> 34:28.700
mentored by Aarón, Alecia.
Let's go.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.302
Alecia:
I got to make churros for my
daycare kids before I left,

34:31.336 --> 34:33.138
so I'm definitely feeling
confident,

34:33.171 --> 34:36.441
and then I also wanna do
really well for Chef Aarón.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.645
I just wanna make him proud
that he gave me this apron.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.713
Alecia, how many times
you made churros?

34:41.747 --> 34:43.882
- This is my second time.
- Wow!

34:43.915 --> 34:48.720
Visually, they are absolutely
clogged with sugar.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.457
I'm talking clump
after clump after clump.

34:52.490 --> 34:54.292
You shot yourself
in the foot there.

34:54.325 --> 34:55.961
How'd you mix
in the eggs?

34:55.994 --> 34:58.864
I beat them
with my hands.

35:01.767 --> 35:05.737
And the hard thing is,
I'm caked in sugar.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.506
I don't want the third
or the fourth bite.

35:08.539 --> 35:11.476
It's dry, it's crumbly.

35:11.509 --> 35:15.013
- And like I said, taste
everything you serve us.
- Yes, Chef.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.581
You're a smart girl.
You would've realize
it's too much sugar,

35:16.614 --> 35:18.149
and you could've
dusted them down.

35:18.183 --> 35:19.651
Thank you.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.755
Alecia, one of my favorite
foods is churros.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.357
When I saw you at the end

35:26.391 --> 35:29.160
kind of showboating,
tossing those churros.

35:29.194 --> 35:30.696
You see how they're
breaking apart?

35:30.729 --> 35:32.263
It's 'cause of that.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.965
Mistreating this
really beautiful,

35:33.999 --> 35:36.167
heartwarming dish for me,

35:36.201 --> 35:38.169
that's just like
super disrespectful

35:38.203 --> 35:40.005
and I'm just disappointed
that you did that.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.943
The actual churro itself
needs a lot of work.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.278
The sauce,
no problems there,

35:47.312 --> 35:49.180
but they still have
too much sugar.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.649
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.824
Right. Next up, a home cook
that I gave an apron to.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.558
Samantha. Let's go, please.
Thank you.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.294
I'm looking at my churros.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.963
They needed longer in the fryer.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.898
The chocolate could've used
more cream.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.734
All I can think about
is my family.

36:08.767 --> 36:12.470
I don't wanna disappoint them
by coming home this early.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.006
Samantha,
you've sacrificed a lot

36:15.040 --> 36:16.541
to be in this
competition.

36:16.574 --> 36:19.911
Leaving tonight,
how devastated would you be?

36:19.945 --> 36:22.848
Um... yeah, that'd
be really devastating.

36:22.881 --> 36:27.185
Um... just like putting
everything on hold to be here,

36:27.218 --> 36:29.187
and leaving all my friends
and family behind,

36:29.220 --> 36:31.689
especially when my family needs
me the most right now, you know.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.892
It hasn't even been a year
since we lost my dad.

36:33.925 --> 36:37.896
And I know we're gonna hit
that year mark soon,

36:37.929 --> 36:39.865
in a couple weeks here,

36:39.898 --> 36:41.933
and I know my sister's gonna
have a hard time.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.036
And just the fact that I can't
be there for her is just--

36:45.070 --> 36:47.338
it's really hard.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.174
Will you take a look up
onto the balcony,

36:49.207 --> 36:51.509
and you will see
the talent up there.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.078
Are you as good
as them?

36:55.480 --> 36:58.249
I, unfortunately, don't think
I showed that tonight.

36:58.283 --> 37:00.318
Are you done?

37:03.388 --> 37:04.790
( sighs )

37:09.795 --> 37:11.797
Samantha, will you take
a look up onto the balcony,

37:11.830 --> 37:13.965
and you see
the talent up there.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.134
Are you as good
as them?

37:16.167 --> 37:18.103
I, unfortunately, don't think
I showed that tonight.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.740
Are you done?

37:22.774 --> 37:25.811
I gave up everything, you know.
I don't wanna go home now,

37:25.844 --> 37:27.779
because it's just too soon
for me to go home.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.816
I'm here to stay
and fight till the end.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.284
Okay, visually, they're a little
bit all over the place.

37:33.318 --> 37:35.453
- Right? This one.
- Yeah.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.588
Why's it so flat in the middle?

37:37.622 --> 37:39.390
Just the pressure
of the piping bag,

37:39.424 --> 37:41.526
and uneven with the egg
in the batter.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.896
Let's see how they taste.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.932
What's the chocolate sauce?
What's the flavoring?

37:46.965 --> 37:49.434
The flavoring is a little bit
of orange.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.607
They actually taste better
than they look.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.343
That's my saving grace.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.645
I love your determination.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.081
If there's one thing
that's started to show
in this competition,

38:03.114 --> 38:05.183
it's your lack of experience.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.584
Yeah.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.254
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.622
Go, Sam!

38:11.656 --> 38:13.791
As embarrassing as it is to cry

38:13.825 --> 38:16.161
in front of my mentor, I hope
it showed that even though

38:16.194 --> 38:18.696
there's other people with years
of experience on me,

38:18.729 --> 38:22.133
I have so much more passion
and heart to show the judges.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.135
- ( Aarón sighs )
- I expected more.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.471
- Joe: Tough cook.
- I mean, that idea
of mixing the eggs,

38:26.504 --> 38:28.106
- that's key to a great batter.
- Yeah.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.475
Joe:
You will be losing an apron,
my friend.

38:30.508 --> 38:33.011
All right.
We got it?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.713
I think it's safe to say that
that was a very tough challenge.

38:35.746 --> 38:38.449
But one of you did
all the right things

38:38.483 --> 38:41.552
to be safe from elimination
this evening.

38:41.586 --> 38:43.188
Matt.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.857
- Well done.
- ( cheers and applause )

38:45.891 --> 38:49.861
Now, if I say your name,
please come down to the front.

38:49.895 --> 38:55.633
Shanika, Bowen, Alecia,
and Samantha.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.104
Everyone else can head
straight up to the balcony.

39:07.712 --> 39:11.082
This competition gets tougher
and tougher.

39:11.116 --> 39:16.387
Only one home cook
is leaving tonight.

39:16.421 --> 39:19.357
Shanika and Samantha...

39:21.459 --> 39:23.228
please head up to the balcony.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.233
( whispers )
I can't.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.101
( exhales )
This is tough.

39:32.603 --> 39:38.443
Bowen, Alecia, one home cook
has real potential,

39:38.476 --> 39:41.446
and so much more to give
this competition.

39:41.479 --> 39:45.516
The other has seen the end
of the road,

39:45.550 --> 39:47.785
and is leaving
this competition tonight.

39:47.818 --> 39:51.789
Now, we judges have made
our decision.

39:51.822 --> 39:53.858
I'm curious to see
what the balcony thinks.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.928
Cesar, who's leaving?

39:59.264 --> 40:01.366
Alecia?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.600
Mark, who's leaving?

40:02.633 --> 40:04.936
Bowen.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.237
Emily, who's leaving?

40:06.271 --> 40:07.905
Alecia, Chef.

40:09.607 --> 40:13.644
- Gerron, who's leaving?
- Alecia, Chef.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.583
Gerron...

40:18.616 --> 40:20.485
you are right.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.955
Alecia, I'm sorry.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.557
Bowen, head up to the balcony.

40:26.591 --> 40:27.858
Thank you.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.962
( crying )

40:30.996 --> 40:32.730
Gordon:
Oh, dear.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.432
- ( Bowen crying )
- You're still here.

40:34.465 --> 40:38.303
Alecia, tonight you produced
a churro that--

40:38.336 --> 40:41.406
that was so sugary,
it was virtually inedible.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.008
I'm sorry.

40:43.041 --> 40:46.411
You're time is done here
in the MasterChef kitchen.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.646
Aarón:
Alecia, I gave you my apron
for a reason,

40:48.679 --> 40:50.681
'cause you showed
you have what it takes.

40:50.715 --> 40:51.983
And I think you're well
on your way.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.318
Remember that.

40:53.351 --> 40:56.354
Please, place your apron
on your bench.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.689
- Good night.
- Never give up, girl!

40:58.723 --> 41:00.958
- Love you, Alecia.
- Keep pushing, Alecia.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.927
I feel like I let
Chef Aarón down,

41:02.960 --> 41:04.529
but there's many
positive things

41:04.562 --> 41:07.032
along my journey,
like I met some kickass people,

41:07.065 --> 41:08.766
and definitely some people

41:08.799 --> 41:10.535
that I know that I've learned
a lot from.

41:10.568 --> 41:13.204
No matter what,
you keep reaching for it.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.440
I'm gonna tell my son Alex,
I'm gonna tell the same thing.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.476
Just because I didn't win,
I'm still a winner.

41:22.380 --> 41:25.950
- Narrator: Next time...
- Please welcome Shaun O'Neale.

41:25.983 --> 41:29.187
...a champion returns
for a MasterChef wedding.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.057
It is my honor to declare you
husband and wife.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.991
( cheers and applause )

41:34.025 --> 41:36.294
- But...
- Imagine if it was
your wedding day.

41:36.327 --> 41:39.164
- That's how we gotta work.
- ...when the top 18
join together

41:39.197 --> 41:42.067
- for better or worse...
- Beautiful.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.401
You wanna serve
this ( bleep ).

41:43.434 --> 41:45.002
...the celebration...

41:45.036 --> 41:46.837
MasterChef mashed potatoes.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.539
...ends in heartbreak.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.641
You are not gonna captain
this team any longer,

41:50.675 --> 41:52.377
I'm gonna run it!
