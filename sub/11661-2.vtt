(Rose)<i> On the last episode of</i>
The Golden Girls...

00:43.133 --> 00:45.233
I have heart palpitations.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.567
I can't concentrate.
I forget things.

00:47.633 --> 00:50.667
I get confused.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.200
I know what my destiny is.

00:53.266 --> 00:55.033
I'm going to be a novelist.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.767
I don't believe you're sick,
but you do.

00:58.834 --> 01:01.467
Girls, I have writer's block.

01:01.533 --> 01:03.900
It is the worst feeling
in the world.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.834
Try 10 days without
a bowel movement sometime.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.467
Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
Maybe I am.

01:09.533 --> 01:13.100
There's nothing wrong, Dorothy,
except what happens to everyone.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.233
You're not 30 anymore.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.166
Dorothy could be dying,
and they don't know.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.600
(serene music playing)

01:35.867 --> 01:38.834
(pounding)

01:46.200 --> 01:48.967
Dorothy. Dorothy.

01:49.033 --> 01:52.500
Don't smash the play dough.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.000
Sorry.

01:54.066 --> 01:57.200
Well, you've certainly
seen the best doctors.

01:57.266 --> 01:59.734
The best don't exist.
They're dead.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.367
Well, I don't know about that.

02:02.433 --> 02:06.433
You're the exception, Harry.
I didn't mean you.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.166
Do you think I'm crazy too?

02:08.233 --> 02:10.100
Dorothy, you're very sane.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.233
Just because a doctor
hasn't found something

02:12.300 --> 02:14.734
doesn't mean
there's nothing there.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.066
Are you serious?

02:17.133 --> 02:19.033
How come you know that
and they don't?

02:19.100 --> 02:21.834
Dear, I know you.
You're a stable person.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.000
If you say you're sick,
you probably are.

02:25.066 --> 02:29.567
I want you to see Michael Chang,
a virologist on staff.

02:29.633 --> 02:33.367
There are lots of unknown diseases.
Look at Lyme disease.

02:33.433 --> 02:36.266
-Am I dying?
-I'm afraid so.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.100
You really think so?

02:40.166 --> 02:43.467
Sooner or later.
I guarantee it.

02:43.533 --> 02:46.934
Unless, of course, the Japanese
come up with something.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.200
Here you go.
Here's his name and number.

02:49.266 --> 02:51.834
My God,
what handwriting doctors have.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.367
I can't even read this,
and I just wrote it.

02:56.834 --> 02:59.200
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

02:59.266 --> 03:02.567
How are you gonna know
it's not chicken soup?

03:02.633 --> 03:05.300
We don't keep chicken soup,
only vegetable.

03:05.367 --> 03:08.700
If that looks like vegetable soup,
you're in a lot of trouble.

03:10.633 --> 03:12.033
How are you gonna know
it's mine?

03:12.100 --> 03:14.166
It'll have your name on it.

03:14.233 --> 03:15.600
How old are you?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.300
Too old for you.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.934
Has he been your doctor
since you were little?

03:24.033 --> 03:25.700
He's not my doctor.

03:27.266 --> 03:29.367
He's my friend.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.066
Oh.

03:31.133 --> 03:35.233
Oliver, Oliver, the bottle, please.
Thank you.

03:35.300 --> 03:38.200
Listen, Harry, thank you.

03:38.266 --> 03:40.000
Thank you.
I can't tell you what it means

03:40.066 --> 03:42.667
to have someone like you.
Believe me.

03:42.734 --> 03:46.266
Give me that. That's not his.
He had Buddy Klein do it for him.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.867
This is a proxy?

03:51.934 --> 03:53.500
He doesn't mind doing it
in his own bed

03:53.567 --> 03:56.767
but not in a public place.

03:58.133 --> 04:00.600
Kind of like sex.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.667
Maybe where you come from.

04:08.066 --> 04:11.533
(mellow music playing)

04:20.934 --> 04:24.300
Rose, what the hell are you doing?

04:24.367 --> 04:26.133
I'm making omelets without yolks

04:26.200 --> 04:28.367
so we don't get
too much cholesterol.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.400
And that leaves us all these yolks
which I hate to throw out,

04:33.467 --> 04:35.266
so I thought we'd give them
to the homeless.

04:38.066 --> 04:39.767
Give them egg yolks.

04:39.834 --> 04:43.233
They'll die of heart attacks.
They won't need homes.

04:44.367 --> 04:48.033
Your heart's in the right place, but
I don't know where your brain is.

04:50.934 --> 04:54.333
-Morning.
-Dorothy, you look terrific.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.133
Where are you going?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.734
To see that specialist
Harry recommended.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.700
Wipe off your make-up.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.400
-Why?
-You look too healthy.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.900
That's why they don't believe you.
You don't look sick.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.867
She should go.
They'd believe her.

05:12.934 --> 05:14.800
Blanche, you look terrible.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.300
What day is this?

05:17.367 --> 05:19.200
I've been up for 72 hours.

05:19.266 --> 05:21.033
I had a breakthrough.

05:21.100 --> 05:25.233
I discovered a new form of writing.
I'll go down in history.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.600
I wrote all day, then I tore it up.
Then it came to me.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.900
The words poured like liquid.

05:32.967 --> 05:34.934
It was a mystical experience.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.800
Somebody else was writing this.

05:36.867 --> 05:37.734
Who?

05:40.967 --> 05:42.533
Everyman.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.300
This is everyman's work.

05:44.367 --> 05:47.700
Open it anywhere,
the magic will touch you.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.800
But I'm so tired.

05:52.867 --> 05:55.600
I must sleep, and I cannot sleep.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.667
I'm too tired to sleep.

05:57.734 --> 06:00.266
I will never sleep again.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.900
I may die from this.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.633
What am I going to do?

06:14.266 --> 06:16.533
My God, I'm hallucinating.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.533
I see little balls
of sunshine in a bag.

06:30.734 --> 06:32.633
Does this mean something?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.767
Those are egg yolks, Blanche.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.800
Oh. My brain's gone.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.734
My body is limp with exhaustion.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.300
I suppose all the greats
knew this feeling.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.600
And the thing is,

06:48.667 --> 06:51.333
after all this,
I've decided not to sell my book.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.967
It's too good to sell.

06:53.033 --> 06:55.166
They can publish it after I'm dead.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.000
Like Vincent Van Gogh.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.266
Van Gogh was a painter.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.166
Whatever.
It's all the same thing.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.567
We're all artists.
We're all misunderstood.

07:05.633 --> 07:09.600
He cut off his hair.
Maybe I'll cut off mine.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.667
He cut off his ear.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.300
I have too many earrings.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.400
We've got to go.
I hate to leave.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.633
I've never seen a show
like this before.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.500
Good luck. I hope he
finds something wrong with you.

07:30.934 --> 07:32.667
I don't mean something wrong, wrong.

07:32.734 --> 07:35.133
I mean, something wrong
so you know you're right

07:35.200 --> 07:39.033
when you know something's wrong
and haven't been wrong all along.

07:39.100 --> 07:44.133
I can't even understand people
when they speak, I'm so tired.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.700
What did she just say?
Was that a poem?

07:48.467 --> 07:49.767
Rose, make her lie down.

07:49.834 --> 07:54.934
I do try, but I pop right up like
one of those clowns you hit.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.233
I'll never rest.
I'll never rest again.

07:58.300 --> 08:03.533
Have a good time, Dorothy.
Buy me a present.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.166
I'll make you some hot milk,
and then you're going to bed.

08:07.233 --> 08:11.100
Rose, I'm going to let you
read a few pages.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.967
You have to give me your word
you won't tell anyone.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.734
Then will you sleep?

08:16.800 --> 08:21.533
Whatever. I can trust you.
You're from Minnesota.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.300
People from Minnesota are honest.

08:25.367 --> 08:26.633
They don't lie.

08:27.533 --> 08:32.100
What could you possibly
find to lie about on a farm?

08:32.166 --> 08:33.667
Must be some state.

08:35.066 --> 08:38.200
Lots of lakes and nice pale people.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.700
I'd drown myself.

08:43.734 --> 08:46.934
Read, Rose.
Don't talk.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.200
I must publish a guide to my book.

08:49.266 --> 08:53.300
It's too full of references
people couldn't possibly understand.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.133
It will be taught in universities.

09:03.133 --> 09:04.467
Rose, what is this?

09:04.533 --> 09:06.600
Yellow eyeballs are staring at me.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.633
Those are egg yolks.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.367
Blanche, you are exhausted.

09:11.433 --> 09:12.600
You have to sleep.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.734
To sleep, perchance to dream.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.767
My God, what a wonderful line.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh.

09:21.066 --> 09:24.433
I'm getting so good,
I can't stand it.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.767
I ought to write that
in my book.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.367
What do you think, Rose?

09:29.433 --> 09:32.266
I don't understand any of this.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.000
It doesn't seem
to make any sense.

09:35.066 --> 09:37.367
Doesn't make sense?

09:37.433 --> 09:39.834
Since when are you a literary
critic, Rose Nylund?

09:39.900 --> 09:40.734
I'm not.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.333
You're from Minnesota.
What have you read?

09:43.400 --> 09:44.500
<i>Silas Marner?</i>

09:44.567 --> 09:45.667
<i>Paul Bunyan?</i>

09:45.734 --> 09:47.500
Nothing. You know nothing.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.667
People from Minnesota
are considered well-read

09:49.734 --> 09:51.767
if they get through
the sears catalogue.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.500
Give me my book.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.834
This is why Hollywood
won't get it either.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.867
I will not have my words coming out
of Glenn Close's mouth.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.333
I'd rather die.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.367
Come on, Blanche.
Let's get you to bed.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.667
But it's my duty to the public.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.734
No, I must have it published.
It's my duty.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.200
I'm so tired.

10:14.266 --> 10:16.633
Come on.
You can sleep here.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.500
Tell me a story.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.900
That always puts me to sleep.
It works every time.

10:20.967 --> 10:24.133
Just tell me one
of your boring stories.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.934
Okay.

10:32.734 --> 10:36.700
(calm music playing)

10:41.133 --> 10:44.166
I want you to know,
I'm crazy about Chinese people.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.367
Ma.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.767
It's a compliment. I am.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.233
Thank you, Mrs. Petrillo.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.100
Chinese people revere the elderly.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.467
This country throws
away anything that's old.

11:03.533 --> 11:07.166
But you people don't.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.667
You also have the most gorgeous
hair in the world.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.166
Even when it's humid.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.500
Ma, please, let Dr. Chang read.

11:16.567 --> 11:19.500
It's ok, Mrs. Zbornak. I'm finished.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.600
You've seen some
wonderful doctors,

11:21.667 --> 11:23.500
but I can't agree
with their findings.

11:23.567 --> 11:28.533
There are new diseases arising,
things we don't have tests for,

11:28.600 --> 11:30.867
but that doesn't mean
the diseases don't exist.

11:30.934 --> 11:34.600
See how terrific the Chinese
are with food.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.233
Tasty, but not fattening.

11:36.300 --> 11:41.500
I don't care what anyone says,
I don't get hungry an hour later.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.700
Let Dr. Chang finish.

11:43.767 --> 11:47.400
I love Chinese checkers
much better than plain checkers.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.734
Chopsticks, a great idea.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.734
Who knows what fork to use
at dinner? Chopsticks--

11:52.800 --> 11:54.333
Ma, enough!

11:57.333 --> 11:58.667
Dr. Chang, please.

11:58.734 --> 12:02.066
Well, I think that you are sick.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.633
I think you have
chronic fatigue syndrome.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.467
It's fairly recent.
Most believe it's a virus.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.500
It hasn't been identified yet.

12:10.567 --> 12:12.633
The man's a genius.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.934
By the way, I loved
<i>Flower Drum Song.</i>

12:16.433 --> 12:19.233
Doctors kept telling me
I was depressed.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.567
Depression can make
a person feel tired.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.266
But depression
doesn't start suddenly,

12:23.333 --> 12:26.300
give swollen glands,
and other symptoms.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.834
There are blood tests we'll do.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.967
If those results are abnormal,

12:31.033 --> 12:33.333
that combined with the exclusion
of other diseases,

12:33.400 --> 12:36.800
will compose a profile
that many people fit.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.667
I have something real?

12:38.734 --> 12:40.700
I'd say you do.

12:40.767 --> 12:43.066
But we'll have our answers
in two weeks.

12:43.133 --> 12:46.467
How long will it last?
Does it get worse?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.100
Does anyone die from it?

12:48.166 --> 12:50.033
No one's died from it.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.700
We don't know how long it lasts.

12:51.767 --> 12:55.300
Some recover in months,
some not after 10 years.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.800
But that happens
in other diseases too.

12:57.867 --> 13:01.500
Take multiple sclerosis,
some have 20-year-remissions,

13:01.567 --> 13:04.934
others wind up in wheelchairs.
There are variations.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.266
You're a genius.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.633
All your people are brilliant.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.633
The Chinese invented pasta,
you know.

13:13.700 --> 13:17.700
We take credit for it,
but we just added oregano.

13:20.433 --> 13:24.433
All I can say is,
try to adapt to it.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.000
Rest, eat well,
eliminate stress if you can.

13:28.066 --> 13:29.166
Right now there's no cure,

13:29.233 --> 13:31.967
and no one thing relieves
symptoms in everyone.

13:32.033 --> 13:34.767
Right now
you'll have to live with it.

13:34.834 --> 13:38.500
Why didn't they tell me,
all those doctors I saw?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.867
I'm sure some of them
weren't familiar with it.

13:40.934 --> 13:44.767
Others have trouble
believing it exists,

13:44.834 --> 13:48.133
since they can't see it
under their microscopes.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.467
Those colleagues of mine,
unfortunately,

13:50.533 --> 13:52.066
tend to blame the victim.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.400
What a relief this is.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.033
I'm sure.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.266
Are there any other questions
I could answer?

13:58.333 --> 14:00.467
Not that I can think of.

14:00.533 --> 14:03.533
Right now
I can't even think straight.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.734
If there are no more questions,
I'll order some blood work.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.433
I have a question.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.133
Of course, Mrs. Petrillo.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.233
When I order at Fung Chow's
and say, "no MSG,"

14:16.300 --> 14:19.033
do they really put it in anyway?

14:29.300 --> 14:33.300
(serene music playing)

14:35.367 --> 14:38.000
I don't believe it.
Another rejection.

14:38.066 --> 14:41.233
This one isn't even personal.
It's a form letter.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.767
They just filled in
my name at the top.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.867
Oh! I'm so upset.

14:45.934 --> 14:47.567
I put everything into this.

14:47.633 --> 14:50.133
I held nothing back.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.500
Then to have some snot-nosed kid
from Harvard

14:52.567 --> 14:54.900
send me a form letter!

14:54.967 --> 14:57.066
I'm so mad
I could scream.

14:58.467 --> 15:01.033
Aah!

15:04.066 --> 15:06.500
That's the first time
I heard anybody say,

15:06.567 --> 15:11.066
"I'm so mad I could scream,"
and actually do it.

15:11.133 --> 15:14.433
It's like saying,
"I laughed all the way to the bank."

15:14.500 --> 15:16.433
I never saw anybody
do that, either.

15:19.166 --> 15:22.567
I did all this work, Rose.
I worked so hard.

15:22.633 --> 15:26.367
-I know you did, Blanche.
-I wanted to be special.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.467
I thought this would do it.

15:28.533 --> 15:31.600
I'd publish a novel,
and I'd be special.

15:31.667 --> 15:36.066
Of course I've always been special
because I'm attractive,

15:36.133 --> 15:38.600
but that won't last forever.
I have to be realistic.

15:38.667 --> 15:44.600
Another 20 or 30 years, and
my face and body might start to go.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.767
Then I'll have nothing
to make me special.

15:47.834 --> 15:51.767
That's not what makes
a person special, Blanche.

15:51.834 --> 15:56.467
You're special because you're
a kind, decent, loving individual

15:56.533 --> 16:00.400
with a wonderful heart and a beauty
that comes from your soul.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.867
That's that Minnesota crap again
about the meaning of life.

16:05.900 --> 16:09.300
Well, Blanche, what else is there
besides love and kindness?

16:09.367 --> 16:10.567
Fame and fortune.

16:10.633 --> 16:13.867
-That doesn't bring happiness.
-Like hell it doesn't.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.633
You know, I'm getting sick of you
knocking Minnesota.

16:18.700 --> 16:22.133
Maybe we're not as sophisticated
as Miami.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.133
Maybe we don't have French boutiques
and valet parking

16:26.200 --> 16:29.500
and facelifts
for Christmas vacation.

16:29.567 --> 16:34.333
But we have friends, family,
a sense of community, and caring.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.967
And that's pretty special.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.633
And our people are special too.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.767
And if we have farms, that's great.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.033
Without farms, you couldn't eat.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.567
And without eating,
you wouldn't diet.

16:46.633 --> 16:49.233
And if you couldn't, what would
you do the rest of your life?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.834
Was I harsh?

17:01.200 --> 17:06.433
(mellow music playing)

17:07.700 --> 17:09.734
Ladies. Drinks?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.600
Champagne.
The best you have.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.433
-Dorothy, that's so expensive.
-Shut up, Rose.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.400
This is my treat.
It is a celebration.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.800
What are we celebrating?

17:21.867 --> 17:24.934
My daughter found out
she has a debilitating disease.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.467
Ah!

17:30.533 --> 17:33.066
It has a name. I'm thrilled.

17:33.133 --> 17:36.300
-We all are.
-Well, of course.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.033
Congratulations.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.166
Champagne it is.

17:39.233 --> 17:44.700
It's a relief to just be sick,
not sick and crazy,

17:44.767 --> 17:46.633
and to know what I have

17:46.700 --> 17:49.533
and that other people
have the same thing.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.934
I don't like the name.
It should have a better name.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.033
That's what Dr. Chang said.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.533
Chronic fatigue syndrome

17:57.600 --> 18:00.300
makes it sound like
I'm just a tired person.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.300
It's more than that.

18:02.367 --> 18:05.100
I think they should
name it after you.

18:05.166 --> 18:09.467
Zbornak syndrome.

18:09.533 --> 18:12.633
That sounds like a chess move.

18:12.700 --> 18:16.033
Devereaux's disease
has a nice ring to it.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.000
-Oh, my God.
-Just a thought.

18:19.066 --> 18:21.667
It's him. I can't believe it.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.133
I saw him first.
Where is he?

18:25.200 --> 18:28.066
It's the neurologist
I saw in New York,

18:28.133 --> 18:33.266
the one who said I was just getting
old and to see a psychiatrist.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.934
Don't make a scene.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.367
Order without me.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.500
Dr. Budd?

18:44.567 --> 18:45.633
Yes.

18:45.700 --> 18:50.734
You probably don't remember me,
but you told me I wasn't sick.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.633
Remember? You told me
I was just getting old.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.100
-Sorry. I really don't...
-Remember.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.367
Maybe you're getting old.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.500
That's a little joke.

19:03.567 --> 19:07.633
Well, I tell you,
Dr. Budd, I really am sick.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.233
I have chronic fatigue syndrome.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.033
That is a real illness.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.700
You can check with the center
for disease control.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.400
I'm sorry about that.

19:16.467 --> 19:20.000
I'm glad.
At least I know I have something.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.333
I'm sure.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
Well... nice seeing you.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.300
Not so fast.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.066
There are some things I have to say.

19:29.133 --> 19:31.200
There are a lot of things
I have to say.

19:31.266 --> 19:35.900
Words can't express
what I have to say.

19:35.967 --> 19:40.333
What you put me through,
I can't do this here.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.900
-Good.
-But I will.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.433
Lewis, who is this person?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.734
-Look, miss--
-Sit. I sat for you long enough.

19:52.967 --> 19:57.500
Dr. Budd, I came to you sick,
sick and scared,

19:57.567 --> 19:58.734
and you dismissed me.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.133
You didn't have the answer.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.000
Instead of saying,
"I don't know what's wrong,"

20:04.066 --> 20:07.367
you made me feel crazy,
like I had made it up.

20:07.433 --> 20:09.633
You dismissed me.

20:09.700 --> 20:13.266
You made me feel like
a child, a fool,

20:13.333 --> 20:17.233
a neurotic who was
wasting your precious time.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.433
Is that your caring profession?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.633
Is that healing?

20:22.700 --> 20:27.333
No one deserves
that kind of treatment.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.800
Had I been a man,

20:28.867 --> 20:31.066
I might have been
taken more seriously

20:31.133 --> 20:33.266
and not told to go to a hairdresser.

20:33.333 --> 20:37.100
-I'm not sitting here and--
-Shut up, Lewis.

20:42.934 --> 20:46.667
I don't know where you doctors
lose your humanity,

20:46.734 --> 20:48.266
but you lose it.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.533
If you, at the beginning
of your careers,

20:50.600 --> 20:53.467
could get very sick and scared,

20:53.533 --> 20:57.300
you'd learn more
from that than anything else.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.967
You'd better start
listening to your patients.

21:00.033 --> 21:02.200
They need to be heard.

21:02.266 --> 21:06.033
They need caring.
They need compassion.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.266
They need attending to.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.800
Someday you'll be on
the other side of the table.

21:11.867 --> 21:16.734
As angry as I'll always be,

21:16.800 --> 21:20.033
I still wish you a better doctor
than you were to me.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.600
Are you all right?

21:29.667 --> 21:32.800
I feel better than I have in ages.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.266
To my friends...

21:35.333 --> 21:38.767
who made being sick a little easier
because they cared.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.266
Oh.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.400
This is the best champagne
I've ever tasted.

21:45.467 --> 21:48.767
It should be. It's $430 a bottle.

21:53.266 --> 21:55.900
Rose, I can't afford that.

21:55.967 --> 21:57.400
You did say the best.

21:57.467 --> 21:59.367
You should have told me.

21:59.433 --> 22:02.700
I said, "the best,"
but nothing like this.

22:02.767 --> 22:05.300
What am I going to do?

22:05.367 --> 22:07.000
I'll show you a Sicilian trick.

22:07.066 --> 22:11.233
This is how I managed to eat
in Italy's best restaurants.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.633
Watch.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.200
Look. Learn.

22:20.467 --> 22:23.000
It's awful. Swill!

22:23.066 --> 22:24.367
Is there a problem?

22:24.433 --> 22:26.967
You take off your socks
before stepping on grapes.

22:27.033 --> 22:27.967
Taste this!

22:32.033 --> 22:33.367
Mmmph!

22:33.433 --> 22:34.533
Oh, dear.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.834
Ladies, I'm terribly sorry.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.700
I'll get you a new bottle.

22:37.767 --> 22:40.567
No, no. It lingers on the palate.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.200
We won't be able
to drink champagne for weeks.

22:45.266 --> 22:48.333
At least let us pay for your meal.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.400
If you insist.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.100
Thank you.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.066
Now it's a celebration.

23:16.166 --> 23:19.700
(theme music playing)
