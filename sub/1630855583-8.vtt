<i>You've had a minor heart attack.</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:05.130
But I'm healthy enough
to still direct a play, right?

00:05.130 --> 00:07.466
You need to reduce stress

00:07.466 --> 00:09.760

it might not be so small.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.185
This one... just didn't sing.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.937
My folks adopted me

00:19.937 --> 00:21.647
when they thought they couldn't have kids.

00:21.647 --> 00:22.731
But then, they had Ben.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.692
A guy who, by the way,
was always fucking up.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.903
Dickie said that Ben
always got the credit.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.113
What, CoBro was Dickie's creation?

00:30.113 --> 00:31.073
That's motive.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.616

in charge of a playground?

12:32.753 --> 12:35.005
I knew it. This is Mabel's fault,

12:35.005 --> 12:37.716
swinging solo in our podcast playground.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.010
Let's stay away from
blaming words like "fault."

12:40.010 --> 12:41.637
Neutral language, please.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.597
Oh...

12:43.597 --> 12:45.641
Y'all are fighting.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.601
Actually, you know what?
Don't tell me.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.102
I don't even care.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.105
I'm gonna go find a room
to do some interrogations.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.860
Oliver, I know you and I
haven't been seeing eye-to-eye,

12:56.860 --> 12:59.279
but we've got to get in
on those interviews.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.866
Look, my show is hanging
on by a thread here.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.536
Finding this killer is the only way

13:05.536 --> 13:07.663
that you'll actually
have an opening night.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.082
She's right. We're back. Whoa-ho-ho!

13:10.082 --> 13:11.625
Hands in! Let's go!

13:11.625 --> 13:13.627
I made a huge break in the case.
You gotta come with me.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.004
Mm, just Mabel.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.882
The ace investigator
with a closet full of cashmere.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.176
I wanna be her in a next life.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.177
<i>Follow me.</i>

13:23.262 --> 13:25.514
It's okay, go.
I'll spy on Williams.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.517
- Seriously?
- Yes, yes.

13:28.517 --> 13:31.061
I-If cracking this case

13:31.061 --> 13:33.272
means I save my show, I'm in.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.024
It's just, it's been a minute.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.527
Mabel, trust us. We've got this.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.529
Mabel! Come on.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.243
- Williams!
- Yeah, okay.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.872
So when the cops came,
I rushed in here

13:49.872 --> 13:52.875
to shred my Papa Smurf-Skeletor slash-fic.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.793
In the wrong hands,
it could be misunderstood.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.295
Then, this happened.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.008
The spooky sound from opening night,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.093
when I was looking for the broom,
and the door was locked.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.137
Someone was in here shredding something.

14:05.137 --> 14:08.599
Yes! So we're left with two questions.

14:08.599 --> 14:11.852
What was happening in here
right before Ben Glenroy was poisoned,

14:11.852 --> 14:13.896
and can I be on your podcast?

14:13.896 --> 14:16.273
I don't know. I mean,

14:16.273 --> 14:18.734
it could be linked to Ben's death,
or it could not be.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.736
Either way, the evidence is destroyed.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.154
We can reassemble it.

14:22.863 --> 14:23.864
I can.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.577
I am a master at word searches
and jumbles.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.078
I was an unpopular child.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.288
<i>No.</i>

14:31.288 --> 14:34.541
I can take any word and list every word
you can make out of its letters.

14:35.250 --> 14:39.213
Take "puzzle," for example.
From "puzzle," you can make "up" and...

14:41.465 --> 14:43.258
Actually, "up" might be
the only word in puzzle.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.135
That was a bad example.
Give me another word, Mabel.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.595
Uh, uh, "treasure."

14:46.595 --> 14:48.514
Erasure, austere, rats.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.557
Mabel, we don't have time
to list them all!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.893
We need to reassemble these!
There might be a clue.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.354
- Okay, I can help.
- Great. Go get me some scotch tape.

14:55.354 --> 14:58.232
No, I can actually help.
I mean, puzzles are kind of my thing, too.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.109
There's a killer on the loose!
This is what I do!

15:01.109 --> 15:03.529
Go get me scotch tape,
then get the hell out of my way.

15:05.364 --> 15:06.406
O-Oh...

15:09.826 --> 15:13.205
See? Perfect for sitting
and probing during sitzprobe?

15:13.205 --> 15:15.040
You got your low lighting,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.959
you got an ergonomic chair,

15:16.959 --> 15:18.585
uh, back issues of <i>The New Yorker.</i>

15:18.585 --> 15:20.671
A fantastic "Talk of the Town" piece

15:20.671 --> 15:22.840
about a pigeon who lives in
a clock at the Guggenheim.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.092
Yeah, I don't give a damn
about your old-man magazines,

15:25.092 --> 15:27.261
but I do love a good chair.
Lumbar support?

15:27.261 --> 15:28.554
For days!

15:28.554 --> 15:30.681
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

15:30.681 --> 15:31.974
Okay.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.227
Young man, come and have a seat.
Ah, yeah.

15:35.227 --> 15:38.188
Thank you. Charles,
I'm not talking till you get up and go.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.818
Okay. Sure. Yeah. Have fun.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.238
Okay, so...

15:48.532 --> 15:50.909
Please leave. Sorry about that.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.579
Uh, so opening night,

15:53.579 --> 15:55.873
you arrived at the theater at what time?

15:55.873 --> 15:58.542
Um, let's see,
I-I got here before Kimber--

15:58.542 --> 15:59.376
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.003
I'm just looking
for my weighted blanket.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.840
Just continue the questioning
like I'm not even here. Blanket...

16:05.507 --> 16:08.760
You got here at what time?
Um, I think around 5:00?

16:08.760 --> 16:11.096
Okay, 5:00 p.m.?
And did you get in contact

16:11.096 --> 16:12.723
with your stage manager at all?

16:12.723 --> 16:15.559
Jeez! These things weigh, like, 60 pounds.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.020
It's like the weight of a small man!

16:18.020 --> 16:20.522
Or a big cozy dog.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.609
Charles. Knock it off.
Get outta here.

16:23.609 --> 16:27.112
Well, the trouble is
I'm weighted down now.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.739
I can hardly move.

16:28.739 --> 16:31.783
I'll tell you what, I just won't listen.
Huh! Look at this.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.912
Yeah, here we go.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.499
Whatever.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.084
So, you got here what time? You said 5:00?
- Yes.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.961
And did you notify the stage manager?

16:42.961 --> 16:44.963
I did not. I forgot to notify her--

16:44.963 --> 16:46.089
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.883
<i>♪ Which of the Pickwick Triplets
did it ♪</i>

16:47.883 --> 16:49.384
Hey.
- What?!

16:50.302 --> 16:51.678
I know what you're doing!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.847
I'm just practicing my patter song.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.141
A-And not to brag, but I can do
four lines in a row now

16:56.141 --> 16:58.477
without going into a panic attack.

16:58.477 --> 17:01.772
Yeah, that's not really a brag.
Get out!

17:22.584 --> 17:24.169
Come in.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.049
Hello.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.512
You took something from my apartment.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.306
Didn't you?

17:37.266 --> 17:38.767
Yes, I did.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.645
And I shouldn't have.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.606
Here.

17:46.859 --> 17:49.278
You don't owe me any explanation.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.239
I mean,

17:52.239 --> 17:54.700
sure, th-the book is a <i>little</i> odd,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.702
but, uh,

17:56.702 --> 17:58.412
th-th-the point is

17:58.412 --> 18:01.123
y-y-you don't need to tell me.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.667
Thank you.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.505
See, this is where you jump in

18:08.505 --> 18:10.966
a-and tell the story behind the book,

18:10.966 --> 18:14.094
so we can move on
and never speak of it again.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.387
You <i>don't</i> trust me.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.390
Of course, I trust you.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.933
I-I was confused.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.936
But it's not like I think
you're the killer.

18:24.897 --> 18:26.607
In fact, Mabel thinks it's Dickie,

18:26.607 --> 18:28.901
and Mabel's never wrong.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.277
Except when she suggested

18:30.277 --> 18:33.280
that I remove the singing
crab people from the show. I mean,

18:33.280 --> 18:36.241
that's just lunacy.
- Dickie? Why Dickie?

18:36.241 --> 18:37.492
I mean...

18:38.243 --> 18:39.953
Ben's creepy brother?

18:41.079 --> 18:42.164
I can see it.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.082
KT [on PA]: <i>Loretta to the stage for</i>
The Nanny's Lullaby.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.084
<i>Loretta to the stage.</i>

18:46.084 --> 18:47.586
So...

18:52.090 --> 18:54.593
Yeah, yeah.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.762
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, got you. Just...

18:59.932 --> 19:03.519
And then my family, they moved down
to Florida, which was really tough on me

19:03.519 --> 19:06.730
because my mother only has one foot--

19:06.730 --> 19:08.690
Bobo. Bobo, please.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.194
Again, I'm gonna remind you,
this is a police interview.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.695
Cut all that family shit out.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.863
- Okay.
- Now, focus.

19:14.863 --> 19:18.492
Five minutes before the curtain went up,
where were you?

19:18.492 --> 19:20.077
- I--
- Very quickly.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.662
Oh, my God.

19:21.662 --> 19:23.413
I just wanted to say sorry for Charles.

19:23.872 --> 19:27.334
I-It's my fault he's acting up,
you know. I-I...

19:27.334 --> 19:30.629
I gave him a patter song,
which is theater parlance--

19:30.629 --> 19:32.339
I know what the fuck a patter song is.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.799
Is it the Gilbert & Sullivan thing, right?

19:33.799 --> 19:35.467
Like <i>Pirates of the Pen...</i>
You know what?

19:35.467 --> 19:37.135
No! We're not doing this!

19:37.135 --> 19:39.388
We're not doing this.
Stay focused, now.

19:39.388 --> 19:42.391
Anyway, it ratcheted up his anxiety

19:42.391 --> 19:44.560
to a whole new level.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.812
Now, I don't know if
you've ever hit a deer,

19:46.812 --> 19:50.065
but in the moment before
your car makes impact,

19:50.065 --> 19:51.483
there's a look in their eyes...

19:51.483 --> 19:54.027
And Charles is the deer. I got it.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.737
Do you, though?

19:55.737 --> 19:58.282
Maybe I just stay here...
- No.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.200
...until I think of the right
devastating analogy.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.411
- Putnam?
- What?

20:02.411 --> 20:04.413
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.792
- Close the door!
- Oh, yes.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.545
Good seeing you.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.964
Seriously? How many rolls

20:13.964 --> 20:16.383
of colored masking tape
does a theater need?

20:16.383 --> 20:18.510
Where's the scotch tape?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.012
Hey.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.848
That's spike tape.
I got you. Here.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.058
I never go anywhere without it.

20:26.727 --> 20:29.605
Side gig as a professional gift wrapper.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.690
- Thank you.
- Mm.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.067
So, um...

20:35.194 --> 20:37.154
Oliver says that you're investigating,

20:37.154 --> 20:39.114
so I thought, hm,

20:39.114 --> 20:40.824
maybe I should find out

20:40.824 --> 20:43.535
what your theory is and lend a hand?

20:44.995 --> 20:47.623
You know,
killers sometimes insert themselves

20:47.623 --> 20:49.291
into investigations.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.878
Oh. [laughs] That's really funny.

20:53.337 --> 20:56.131
No! No, I just really wanna help.

20:56.131 --> 20:59.301
I mean, this show means the world to me.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.471
God, it's supposed to be
my Broadway debut.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.473
For God's sake.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.267
Took me long enough.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.357
There's nothing wrong
with being a late bloomer.

21:13.357 --> 21:15.609
I'm one myself.

21:16.527 --> 21:18.028
Mm.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.615
I'm looking at Dickie.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.287
Oh, you don't want it to be him, do you?

21:27.287 --> 21:29.623
I mean, I know you have
a relationship with him.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.542
Wh-Wh-What do you mean?

21:31.542 --> 21:32.835
Isn't he your manager or something?

21:32.835 --> 21:35.128
Oh, yeah! He-- [laughs] Yeah, he's my...

21:35.128 --> 21:37.256
Of course, I don't want it to be him,

21:37.256 --> 21:39.466
but I also don't think he did it.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.261
I mean, Dickie's just a really good kid.

21:42.261 --> 21:43.637
Isn't he, like, 50?

21:43.637 --> 21:45.347
Yeah, he's a child.

21:46.557 --> 21:48.392
Well, but what about poison?

21:48.392 --> 21:50.060
You know, not to be sexist,

21:50.060 --> 21:52.896
but that is more a woman's method.

21:52.896 --> 21:56.275
Well, Dickie was in
charge of Ben's food.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.151
Could be easy and convenient.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.656
Uh, yeah, but before
we pin it on him

22:02.656 --> 22:05.158
you should know that there is a cast of...

22:06.076 --> 22:09.454
much odder characters around this show.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.040
I'm just gonna throw a name out. Bobo.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.169
We don't really know Bobo, do we?

22:15.169 --> 22:16.795
I mean, he's the comic relief,

22:16.795 --> 22:20.632
but, um, is the comedy
hiding something sinister?

22:20.632 --> 22:23.343
I thought poison was a woman's method.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.554
Oh, yeah. Right, right. So...

22:25.554 --> 22:27.139
KT! What a bitch.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.642
Could be...

22:30.642 --> 22:32.686
I'm just trying to, um,

22:32.686 --> 22:36.064
picture Dickie as a murderer, and, um...

22:36.064 --> 22:37.858
Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.029
And no. I can't.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.739
Sorry.

22:43.739 --> 22:44.990
I just can't picture it.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.202
Thanks.

22:53.999 --> 22:57.920
KT [on PA]: <i>Charles-Haden Savage

22:58.879 --> 23:00.380
<i>God help us all.</i>

23:04.426 --> 23:06.053
I really have to do the whole thing?

23:06.053 --> 23:08.889
Yes. All two minutes, 46 seconds.

26:42.728 --> 26:44.229
You were right.

26:44.897 --> 26:48.650
Our killer might have stood
right here on opening night.

26:49.067 --> 26:51.778
There's something important in there,
and only you can find it.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.405
I don't know if I can.

26:53.405 --> 26:56.450
Howard, what are
the words in "determined"?

26:56.950 --> 26:58.952
Tired. Denied.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.954
- Keep going.
- Remedied.

27:02.164 --> 27:04.750
Redeem... Me.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.252
Oh. That worked better than I expected.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.837
See? You <i>can</i> do this.

27:09.296 --> 27:10.797
I did find this.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.010
That's the date of opening night.

27:15.010 --> 27:18.347
Okay, find all the other pieces
with the same font.

27:18.347 --> 27:21.183
Who knows, you might get
a spot on the podcast.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.601
I can be on the podcast?

27:22.601 --> 27:24.895
I said "might" and "who knows."

27:26.939 --> 27:29.608
I'm gonna need a lot more fucking tape.

27:30.484 --> 27:32.736
- Here she comes.
- Alright.

27:34.446 --> 27:37.699
So! I'm assuming no luck with Williams?

27:37.699 --> 27:39.826
Funny, isn't it? The way she doubts us.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.787
Oh, she thinks we're fools.

27:41.787 --> 27:44.540
But that's only because
we're so skilled at playing them.

27:44.540 --> 27:46.583
Weird flex, but okay.

27:46.583 --> 27:49.837
We have the interrogations on tape.

27:49.837 --> 27:51.213
On tape?

27:51.213 --> 27:54.466
Charles, let's bring
the lady up to speed.

27:54.466 --> 27:56.718
Well, I went in first...

27:57.719 --> 27:59.513
<i>...making Williams think
I was just an idiot</i>

27:59.513 --> 28:01.056
<i>trying to eavesdrop.</i>

28:01.056 --> 28:03.809
<i>But, really, I was piquing her interest.</i>

28:03.809 --> 28:07.062
<i>For, you see,
Detective Williams is a theater nut.</i>

28:07.062 --> 28:08.647
<i>♪ Which of the Pickwick Triplets did it? ♪</i>

28:09.106 --> 28:11.567
<i>We knew she'd be
interested in a patter song,</i>

28:11.567 --> 28:13.902
<i>and doubly so if it involved Charles</i>

28:13.902 --> 28:16.238
<i>absolutely humiliating himself.</i>

28:16.238 --> 28:18.448
Now, I don't know
if you've ever hit a deer...

28:18.448 --> 28:22.411
<i>So, I painted a picture
of just how tragic Charles was on stage.</i>

28:23.579 --> 28:25.080
<i>The bait was set.</i>

28:26.957 --> 28:28.667
You need to get me
the time to sneak past

28:28.667 --> 28:30.627
this phalanx of coppers
so I can set it all up.

28:30.627 --> 28:31.920
- I've got this.
- Okay.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.797
I just have to say
one word after another.

28:33.797 --> 28:36.800
- One word, yes. Uh-huh.
- Faster than any human ever should.

28:39.428 --> 28:43.056
<i>She took it, and the interrogation
room was left unattended.</i>

28:44.474 --> 28:45.976
Okay...

28:55.235 --> 28:58.030
<i>Of course, in order
to give Oliver the time needed,</i>

28:58.030 --> 29:00.449
<i>I had to get through all of it.</i>

29:00.449 --> 29:02.075
<i>Didn't miss a word.</i>

29:03.160 --> 29:06.747
So, you're saying with Tobert's GoPro...

29:06.747 --> 29:08.540
We recorded everything.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.210
All the big interrogations.

29:11.210 --> 29:14.505
Oh, my God! That sounds
so unnecessarily complicated,

29:14.505 --> 29:16.215
but you guys actually did it.

29:16.215 --> 29:17.716
Uh-huh.

29:17.716 --> 29:19.968
You know what this calls for.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.681
Wanna make a podcast with me?

29:27.768 --> 29:29.269
Oh, my God, this is corny.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.771
- So corny.
- I know, it is.

29:30.771 --> 29:33.315
- So, so corny.
- But i-it was good. It was cute.

29:33.315 --> 29:34.942
- It's fun, yeah.
- It's cute.

29:35.901 --> 29:36.985
- Murder?
- Yeah.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.403
Murder, yeah.

29:53.293 --> 29:54.670
Nerves.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.508
Forty years in show business,
and I've still got 'em.

29:59.508 --> 30:01.426
Who doesn't?

30:03.679 --> 30:05.681
Is everything alright, dear?

30:05.681 --> 30:08.559
Oh. Yeah.
I just have some nerves of my own.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.018
Of course.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.688
You saw Maxine Spear out there, I take it.
- Mm-hmm.

30:16.817 --> 30:19.862
It's quite a big swing
we've taken with this show,

30:19.862 --> 30:21.655
trying to save it.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.782
I don't know that I would've hung on

30:24.658 --> 30:27.160
if it weren't for Cliff.
- Mm-hmm.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.746
- His first show.
- I know.

30:29.746 --> 30:32.749
As a mother, you can't help it.

30:32.749 --> 30:35.377
You spend your whole life
looking out for your child.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.462
It never stops.

30:37.462 --> 30:40.382
And you'll do anything
to make sure they're okay.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.634
Mm... hmm.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.313
The final number's next, right?

30:54.313 --> 30:55.898
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, where's Loretta?

30:55.898 --> 30:57.357
We're looking for her.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.985
I do hope you find her.

30:59.985 --> 31:02.821
She's really quite extraordinary, Oliver.

31:03.447 --> 31:04.740
So you like what you're seeing?

31:04.740 --> 31:07.576
Well, when I last saw
this show in previews,

31:07.576 --> 31:09.203
I thought there was no hope,
and when I heard

31:09.203 --> 31:11.496
you were making it into a musical,

31:11.496 --> 31:13.874
I got so excited

31:13.874 --> 31:16.502
that I was gonna savage
your toe-tapping dreams.

31:16.502 --> 31:19.004
But this, this, this, <i>this...</i>

31:21.298 --> 31:23.300
is pure Oliver Putnam.

31:25.135 --> 31:28.430
Uh, tell me, Maxine, does it sing?

31:31.725 --> 31:33.018
You'll have to wait for my review.

31:45.656 --> 31:48.575
Oh. Here you are.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.494
Hey, shouldn't you be getting ready
for your big final number?

31:51.286 --> 31:52.621
Oh yeah.

31:52.621 --> 31:55.541
Something about being
back in this theater.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.753
I just... keep thinking about--

31:59.753 --> 32:02.297
Opening night? I know.

32:03.048 --> 32:05.759
I keep thinking about
the fight I had with Ben

32:05.759 --> 32:07.928
right before he...

32:07.928 --> 32:10.347
You know, he said I was dead to him.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.725
Look, you c-couldn't have known that--

32:13.725 --> 32:15.936
No, it's not that.
I'm not upset I hurt his feelings.

32:15.936 --> 32:17.646
He was a prick.

32:18.438 --> 32:21.692
I just knew the next morning,
he'd rope me back in.

32:22.484 --> 32:24.987
But when he was gone,

32:26.738 --> 32:29.533
for those few brief moments, I just,

32:30.909 --> 32:32.286
I felt free.

32:35.664 --> 32:37.291
And then he was back.

32:38.041 --> 32:41.336
I was trapped again.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.047
I couldn't take it anymore.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.302
You understand?

32:49.511 --> 32:52.055
Of course, I do.

32:52.055 --> 32:54.224
KT [on PA]: <i>Loretta to the stage for</i>
The Sake of a Child.

32:54.224 --> 32:55.475
<i>Loretta to the stage.</i>

32:56.143 --> 32:58.770
Was there something
you needed to say to me?

32:58.770 --> 33:00.022
Oh.

33:01.190 --> 33:02.608
Mm-mmm.

33:03.817 --> 33:05.694
You didn't deserve this.

33:05.694 --> 33:09.031
None of this ever should have happened.

33:09.031 --> 33:11.033
It's not your fault.

33:12.576 --> 33:16.205
You are the best part about
these last few months for me.

33:18.624 --> 33:19.708
Oh...

33:25.839 --> 33:28.383
Loretta, Loretta, I-I-- c-can I...

33:28.383 --> 33:30.511
Just need just one... Thanks.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.264
We're gonna start
with your part of the song.

33:34.264 --> 33:35.516
And just focus--
- Okay, not Jonathan?

33:35.516 --> 33:38.060
Yeah, well, we'll do
that in a little bit, um...

33:39.019 --> 33:42.689
And listen to me.
I know that you're upset with me.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.858
And that's fine. That's fine.

33:44.858 --> 33:48.737
But, I-I need to say that I <i>do</i> trust you.

33:48.737 --> 33:52.366
And I-I don't care about the book.
I don't care about any of it.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.492
I just wanna be with you.

33:54.618 --> 33:56.161
To do our show.

33:57.037 --> 33:59.540
Excuse me, our <i>hit</i> show,

33:59.540 --> 34:03.752
and go home to your funny little apartment

34:03.752 --> 34:06.004
and just fall asleep in your arms.

34:06.797 --> 34:08.924
- Oliver, you don't have to--
- No, I do.

34:10.884 --> 34:11.927
And there's more.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.514
And it's a biggie.

34:17.558 --> 34:18.684
I love you.

34:20.435 --> 34:23.480
Wow, I haven't said
those words in a minute.

34:25.274 --> 34:26.775
But you know what? It felt right.

34:26.775 --> 34:29.361
So I'm gonna say it again.
Here it goes.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.906
I love you.

34:33.323 --> 34:36.910
