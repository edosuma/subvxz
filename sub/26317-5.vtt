00:00.240 --> 00:01.772
Previously on S.W.A.T.

00:01.773 --> 00:03.288
It's some kind of drama

00:03.313 --> 00:05.281
or is this guy's default button
just set on dick mode?

00:05.315 --> 00:06.549
Don't know who your new smart-ass is,

00:06.583 --> 00:07.550
but good luck with that.

00:07.584 --> 00:09.285
- I lied.
- You're off SWAT.

00:09.319 --> 00:10.973
Hondo, this is not how this ends.

00:11.007 --> 00:12.588
<i>You don't kick people out of a family!</i>

00:12.623 --> 00:15.224
I know I haven't got a chance
at getting back on SWAT

00:15.259 --> 00:17.193
- with these budget cuts.
- Buck pulled strings

00:17.227 --> 00:18.802
to get you transferred
here from Long Beach,

00:18.836 --> 00:20.992
but maybe this time you can do it right

00:21.027 --> 00:22.367
and earn yourself a spot.

00:22.401 --> 00:25.301
Are you saying y-you'd give me a
chance at getting back on SWAT?

00:25.335 --> 00:27.403
I'm saying that I will
get you in SWAT Academy.

00:27.437 --> 00:30.206
So what you got to do is ask
yourself how bad do you want it.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.228
And then go kick ass
and make sure it's you.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.509
I'll do my best.

00:38.151 --> 00:39.918
BARNETT: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:39.953 --> 00:41.392
we are about 90 minutes away

00:41.426 --> 00:43.956
from arriving back home
in the Port of Los Angeles.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.991
I'd like to take this opportunity

00:46.026 --> 00:47.596
to thank you for sailing with us.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.994
We really do hope you had
a pleasant cruise.

00:49.825 --> 00:51.897
Couple of bits of business:

00:51.931 --> 00:53.766
by now, your luggage should've
been picked up

00:53.800 --> 00:55.983
by our bell staff for offloading
upon our arrival.

00:56.017 --> 00:58.037
Also, if you haven't done it yet,

00:58.071 --> 01:00.072
now would be a great time to fill out

01:00.106 --> 01:01.740
your customs declaration forms

01:01.775 --> 01:03.042
for anything you might have picked up

01:03.076 --> 01:04.766
during your visit to Mexico.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.515
So enjoy the rest of your trip
aboard the <i>Tranquil Seas.</i>

01:07.550 --> 01:09.748
- We should have you in port shortly.
- Take care of this.

01:09.783 --> 01:10.916
I'm gonna get the other one.

01:10.950 --> 01:12.684
- Be right back.
- Okay.

01:16.770 --> 01:19.672
Hey! Step away from that, now.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.423
H-Hold on, man. Wait.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.001
Base, I'm gonna need a
supervisor in the forward hold.

01:24.026 --> 01:25.163
(GUNSHOT)

01:29.135 --> 01:31.804
Hey. I got this.

01:31.838 --> 01:32.971
You get rid of him.

01:33.006 --> 01:35.707
Hide him somewhere
till we get off the boat. Go.

Where's the guard who just radioed in?

01:55.422 --> 01:57.309
I don't know, we just got here.

02:12.679 --> 02:14.680
(GRUNTS, PANTS)

02:33.470 --> 02:36.014
GUARD: There's no way out
of this for you.

02:36.729 --> 02:38.530
I just signaled the shore.

02:38.872 --> 02:42.980
The second we dock, there'll be
a hundred cops on board.

02:51.951 --> 02:53.719
Sir, I'm getting an indicator

02:53.753 --> 02:56.155
saying we just put out
a hijack alert code.

02:56.535 --> 02:57.923
Didn't come from the bridge.

02:57.957 --> 03:00.025
Let's figure out where it was keyed in.

03:00.497 --> 03:02.794
HARBORMASTER: <i>Tranquil Seas,
Harbormaster L.A.</i>

03:02.829 --> 03:04.897
We're getting a coded hijack
alert from your vessel.

03:04.931 --> 03:06.284
Can you confirm?

03:06.318 --> 03:08.452
Uh, Harbormaster, this is <i>Tranquil Seas.</i>

03:08.486 --> 03:10.002
We're checking on that.

03:10.382 --> 03:12.509
Let's go ahead and secure the doors.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.741
Over there! Over there!

03:15.775 --> 03:17.042
- (GRUNTS)
- Get away from the door.

03:17.076 --> 03:18.677
Stop the ship.

03:18.711 --> 03:20.078
- Shut it down.
- I can't do that.

03:20.113 --> 03:21.780
(GRUNTS)

03:23.983 --> 03:25.684
I think you can.

03:25.718 --> 03:26.885
Shut it down.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.501
Go, do it.

03:33.439 --> 03:36.128
HARBORMASTER: <i>Tranquil Seas,
I now have you at full stop.</i>

03:36.162 --> 03:38.897
I'm initiating emergency
response protocol.

03:38.932 --> 03:40.699
Do not do that.

03:40.733 --> 03:43.199
If I see anything coming
anywhere near this ship,

03:43.234 --> 03:45.671
I'm gonna start throwing dead
passengers into the ocean.

03:45.705 --> 03:47.377
Do you understand?

03:55.014 --> 03:56.682
Give 'em hell today, huh?

03:56.716 --> 03:58.016
Yeah, don't worry about me.

03:58.051 --> 03:59.885
Just make sure Hondo
doesn't give my spot away

03:59.919 --> 04:00.974
before I get there.

04:02.035 --> 04:04.169
Hey, hold up a sec.

04:04.891 --> 04:06.274
I just wanted to say thanks.

04:06.308 --> 04:08.443
- Right.
- No. I mean, just...

04:08.444 --> 04:10.478
for making SWAT
a possibility again for me.

04:10.513 --> 04:12.247
Well, it won't mean a thing
unless you make it through

04:12.281 --> 04:14.315
- the Academy and earn your way back.
- I know.

04:14.350 --> 04:16.017
But you've always had my back.

04:16.052 --> 04:18.916
Looking out for me,
even when I didn't deserve it.

04:18.951 --> 04:21.375
I mean, besides Buck,
no one else in my whole life's

04:21.410 --> 04:22.756
ever done that for me.

04:22.790 --> 04:23.997
So...

04:26.529 --> 04:28.077
- What?
- Uh...

04:28.102 --> 04:29.464
LUCA: Let's go. Gather
in the ring, everyone.

04:29.498 --> 04:32.615
Nothing, just, uh, go kick some ass.

04:32.649 --> 04:34.469
- I will.
- All right.

04:34.503 --> 04:36.604
MUMFORD: All right, first things first.

04:36.639 --> 04:39.552
Congratulations on passing
your first round

04:39.586 --> 04:40.778
at SWAT Training Academy.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.610
This year, we had... h-how many?

04:42.645 --> 04:46.281
- 93.
- 93 applicants.

04:46.315 --> 04:48.886
So you are the elite eight.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.149
Don't let it go to your heads.

04:52.288 --> 04:53.588
Because the next four weeks

04:53.622 --> 04:56.357
are gonna be the toughest of your lives.

04:56.392 --> 04:59.294
No joke. This is Metro SWAT,
the big leagues.

04:59.328 --> 05:01.396
So you can bet we're gonna
push you till you break.

05:01.430 --> 05:04.471
Better to expose your weaknesses
here than out on an op

05:04.506 --> 05:06.216
where you'll have your teammates
depending on you.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.203
SWAT Academy's always been competitive.

05:08.237 --> 05:11.372
Only the top four or five
usually get a spot.

05:11.407 --> 05:14.242
This year, as you probably heard...

05:15.311 --> 05:18.479
...only one of you will join a team.

05:18.514 --> 05:20.515
So if you want to end up working
in this building,

05:21.012 --> 05:22.896
second best isn't good enough.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.485
ROCKER: Now everybody
hit your first stations.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.354
- Let's go!
- MUMFORD: Move!

05:26.388 --> 05:28.456
Let's go, you guys.

05:29.479 --> 05:30.926
You're not dropping him off

05:30.961 --> 05:32.814
at his first day of kindergarten, Chris.

05:32.849 --> 05:34.295
Let's just stay close.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.497
- I just got word something's cooking.
- Okay.

05:39.197 --> 05:41.202
- Hey.
- Mm.

05:41.237 --> 05:43.204
- Hey.
- Something's not right.

05:43.239 --> 05:45.273
They're lying to us
about why we're not moving.

05:45.307 --> 05:47.375
(SCOFFS) Honey, you
heard the announcement.

05:47.409 --> 05:49.310
There's just some issue in port.

05:49.345 --> 05:51.379
There's a ship blocking our berth.

05:51.413 --> 05:53.098
No, no, no. The Internet is down.

05:53.132 --> 05:54.382
Suddenly, there's no cell signal.

05:54.416 --> 05:55.630
And when I...

05:57.173 --> 05:58.553
when I was coming back from the casino,

05:58.587 --> 06:01.745
I thought... maybe I heard gunshots.

06:01.779 --> 06:06.133
Connor, look around you.
Nothing's happening.

06:06.168 --> 06:07.867
I'm gonna go down to the cabin
and get my sat phone.

06:07.902 --> 06:10.632
Wait. You told me that you didn't
bring your satellite phone.

06:10.666 --> 06:12.908
This trip was supposed to be
about us getting away from work.

06:12.942 --> 06:14.688
- I know, I know.
- Remember?

06:14.722 --> 06:16.304
- Yep.
- Connor!

06:16.785 --> 06:17.852
JESSICA: <i>The cruise line maintains</i>

06:17.886 --> 06:20.655
a video feed from the bridge
of all their ships.

06:20.689 --> 06:22.990
This is the last they got before
communications went down.

06:23.025 --> 06:25.026
Do not do that, do you hear me?

06:25.060 --> 06:27.862
If I see anything coming
anywhere near this ship,

06:27.896 --> 06:29.997
I'm gonna start throwing dead
passengers into the ocean,

06:30.032 --> 06:32.734
you understand? Kill the radio.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.068
Cut out all this communication crap.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.837
JESSICA: That's all there is.

06:35.871 --> 06:37.672
We never see their faces,
but they look like crew.

06:37.706 --> 06:38.940
HONDO: Or they're dressed as crew.

06:38.974 --> 06:41.419
How many passengers on board?
Almost 1,200.

06:41.453 --> 06:43.252
And we don't know
which ones we can trust.

06:43.286 --> 06:45.572
How much support can we count on
even if we can get on board?

06:45.607 --> 06:49.083
The security chief,
Kevin Weller, is former LAPD.

06:49.118 --> 06:51.886
He's got a staff of 15,
but none of them are armed.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.888
I'm running ideas in my head
of how we can get on board.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.857
Won't be easy.

06:55.891 --> 06:58.025
Boat or chopper, they're gonna
see us coming from a mile away.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.861
HICKS: Dispatch just routed us

06:59.895 --> 07:01.696
a 911 call from a sat phone.

07:01.730 --> 07:04.074
Guy named Connor Reeves,
claims to be on the ship.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.159
Put him up.

07:07.369 --> 07:11.839
Connor. This is Sergeant
Harrelson, LAPD Metro SWAT.

07:11.874 --> 07:13.941
You're calling from the <i>Tranquil Seas?</i>

07:13.976 --> 07:15.777
CONNOR: Yeah,
a-and something is going on here

07:15.811 --> 07:17.456
but nobody else seems to realize it.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.504
All right, listen to me.
You're not wrong about that,

07:19.538 --> 07:21.406
but we're gonna keep it
between us, you hear me?

07:21.440 --> 07:22.807
We do not need people panicking.

07:22.841 --> 07:25.095
Yeah, but-but somebody's
gonna help us, right?

07:28.480 --> 07:29.647
You're right about that, too, Connor,

07:29.682 --> 07:30.848
so here's what we're gonna do.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.517
Once we hang up,

07:32.551 --> 07:33.851
I need you to find the security chief.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.687
His name is Kevin Weller.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.590
You keep your sat phone with you
and you go find Weller.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.657
And then we'll get back to you.

07:39.692 --> 07:42.070
All right, but, uh, please hurry.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.496
You got a plan in mind?

07:47.600 --> 07:51.292
This ship, it's about four miles out.

07:51.326 --> 07:52.837
That's within range to go in with <i>Nemo.</i>

07:53.123 --> 07:54.439
HICKS: <i>Nemo?</i>

07:54.473 --> 07:55.740
Chris and I did training exercises

07:55.774 --> 07:57.456
with the SEALs over in Coronado.

07:57.491 --> 07:59.510
But with <i>Nemo,</i> you're only
going in with two operators.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.713
It may also be the only way to
get on that ship unnoticed.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.216
Hondo.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.818
We don't even know what
we're up against yet.

08:06.852 --> 08:08.819
We'll know more once we're on that ship.

08:12.944 --> 08:20.945
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:48.553 --> 08:50.232
60 second out!

08:50.233 --> 08:52.400
Captain's staging a second
SWAT team at the harbor.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.200
They'll be ready
to fast-rope in off a chopper

08:54.225 --> 08:56.061
- if anything goes sideways.
- Can't let it come to that.

08:56.095 --> 08:59.229
There's a service ladder located
halfway up midship on the port side.

08:59.264 --> 09:01.298
That's gonna be your best bet
for ingress. And once you're

09:01.332 --> 09:03.344
on board, there's a lot of ground
you're gonna have to cover.

09:03.378 --> 09:05.477
Even though it's an old ship,
it's-it's like a floating hotel.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.968
There's restaurants, bars,
theaters, casinos.

09:06.993 --> 09:08.749
Damn, Deac. You speaking from experience?

09:08.783 --> 09:10.128
I never pegged you for the cruise type.

09:10.163 --> 09:11.930
DEACON: Well, actually,
Annie's mom loves them.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.508
She got us one for
our second anniversary.

09:13.543 --> 09:15.801
And here I thought your
mother-in-law liked you.

09:15.835 --> 09:17.135
Actually, it was pretty great...

09:17.170 --> 09:19.104
until Annie got sick
the last couple days.

09:19.138 --> 09:21.106
I thought it was seasick, turned
out to be morning sickness.

09:21.140 --> 09:22.908
- But I'd do it again.
- No, not me.

09:22.942 --> 09:24.209
I've never been in a
relationship where I want

09:24.243 --> 09:26.549
to be trapped together like
that. No escape, no way.

09:26.584 --> 09:27.946
Come on, now, Chris. That could change.

09:27.981 --> 09:29.014
Not in this lifetime.

09:29.048 --> 09:30.502
So what? Eternal bachelorette, that it?

09:30.536 --> 09:32.589
I-I did meet someone last week,
had a couple dates.

09:32.624 --> 09:34.286
It's a matter of time
before it tanks, though.

09:34.808 --> 09:35.988
That's the job, right?

09:36.022 --> 09:38.890
- TAN: This is it. We're here.
- DEACON: You made good time, Tan.

09:38.925 --> 09:40.495
We might have to have
you drive more often.

09:40.529 --> 09:42.060
Yeah, sure, you tell Luca that.

09:42.095 --> 09:44.162
Ha. All right, let's move.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.002
Remy, man, what are we doing?

09:50.036 --> 09:52.304
You know what'll happen
if we lose those drugs.

09:52.338 --> 09:53.630
We're dead, man.

09:53.664 --> 09:55.537
Our lives will be worth nothing.

09:59.145 --> 10:00.291
Remy.

10:04.469 --> 10:05.769
I can fix this.

10:05.794 --> 10:07.799
Hey, Captain Kirk, get up.

10:09.989 --> 10:11.386
Come over here.

10:12.058 --> 10:14.226
Turn us around, we're
going back to Mexico.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.927
BARNETT: Look, that's not possible.

10:15.962 --> 10:17.679
What I mean is we don't have the fuel.

10:17.714 --> 10:20.332
We only carry enough to go to
Mexico and back, that's it.

10:20.366 --> 10:21.600
Listen to me, you smug son of a bitch.

10:21.634 --> 10:23.301
You're gonna call the harbor.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.873
You call them and you tell them

10:27.907 --> 10:30.697
to get us some fuel, a refueling ship.

10:34.472 --> 10:36.440
The coordinates are already
programmed in the <i>Nemo.</i>

10:36.828 --> 10:38.216
You're pushing the limits
of what it can do,

10:38.251 --> 10:39.704
but it should get you there.

10:39.739 --> 10:42.220
Let's just hope our guy
on the boat does his part.

10:42.255 --> 10:44.256
Otherwise, it's gonna be
a long swim back.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.094

10:50.263 --> 10:52.230
All right, let's do this.

10:56.202 --> 10:59.204
30-David to Command. Divers away.

10:59.238 --> 11:01.106
Our guy with the sat phone,
he's having trouble

11:01.140 --> 11:02.874
locating the security chief.

11:02.874 --> 11:04.842
We're nowhere if he
doesn't get that door open.

11:04.876 --> 11:07.111
Well, in the meantime, we might've
caught a little bit of a break.

11:07.145 --> 11:08.946
The gunmen are demanding more fuel.

11:09.485 --> 11:10.814
So the captain radioed

11:10.849 --> 11:12.883
to request a tanker
for a ship-to-ship refueling.

11:12.918 --> 11:15.111
They told me they didn't have
the capability for that.

11:15.136 --> 11:17.144
They don't,
but these clowns don't know that,

11:17.169 --> 11:18.923
and it'll buy us some extra time.

11:18.957 --> 11:22.126
Until they realize they've been
lied to, and then what happens?

11:25.830 --> 11:27.097
Holster your handguns!

11:27.132 --> 11:29.033
ROCKER: Wait till you see
the new running shoes

11:29.067 --> 11:30.167
I got for the race tonight.

11:30.201 --> 11:31.556
They're like feathers.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.704
Gonna cut 30 seconds off my mile time.

11:33.738 --> 11:35.512
- Yeah, they sound expensive.
- LUCA: Hey, even if they're free,

11:35.546 --> 11:37.841
you paid too much... there's
no way you're gonna beat us.

11:37.876 --> 11:39.090
- Is that right?
- Dusk Till Dawn Relay

11:39.125 --> 11:40.503
was made for 20 Squad.

11:40.538 --> 11:42.200
You might as well put
our names on the trophy

11:42.235 --> 11:44.214
- right now.
- Noticed you didn't sign up to run.

11:44.248 --> 11:46.050
Hey. I'm the coach, right? It's every bit

11:46.084 --> 11:48.052
- as important as the runners.
- Second group, you're up.

11:48.086 --> 11:49.153
Be ready.

11:49.187 --> 11:50.921
Go ahead.

11:50.956 --> 11:52.603

11:52.637 --> 11:54.692
you want to put some
money behind that mouth?

11:54.726 --> 11:56.060
20 Squad versus 50 Squad?

11:56.094 --> 11:58.490
Fine. How's $500 sound?

11:58.524 --> 12:00.097
Sounds cheap.

12:00.364 --> 12:02.332
How about a thousand?

12:20.098 --> 12:22.753

stance down in Long Beach?

Weaver stance was invented
before I was born.

12:24.468 --> 12:25.923
Isosceles works better for me.

12:25.957 --> 12:29.026
Isosceles is not how we
do it at LAPD SWAT.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.996
Didn't you learn anything
while you were on the team?

12:32.030 --> 12:34.932
Hey, Devlin, show him
how it's done. Come here.

12:34.966 --> 12:36.166
Come here.

12:37.101 --> 12:38.668
Go ahead.

12:39.938 --> 12:41.038
All right, bring 'em up.

12:41.577 --> 12:43.107
I mean, yeah, it works fine

12:43.141 --> 12:45.142
for him, I guess.

12:48.046 --> 12:50.943
But... you can't argue with perfection.

12:50.977 --> 12:52.269
Yeah, for once you're right, Street.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.018
I'm not arguing.
Just work on your stance.

12:54.052 --> 12:55.786
Devlin, great job.

12:55.820 --> 12:57.054

13:30.989 --> 13:33.352
- That's right.
- Confirm for me how we made contact.

13:33.386 --> 13:34.925

One of my guys wasn't so lucky, though.

13:55.780 --> 13:57.014
All right, what can you tell us

13:57.048 --> 13:58.782
- about what we're up against?
- There's two of 'em.

13:58.817 --> 14:00.918
Brothers. Both work for the ship.

14:00.952 --> 14:02.886
Colton and Remy Pope.

Both armed: one a nine-mil;
the other a .40-cal, I think.

down in the dry hole after they left.

14:13.798 --> 14:15.766
My guy must have discovered it.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.935

14:17.969 --> 14:19.069
I'll have Deacon and Tan check out

something that'll help you.
HONDO: 20-David. Roger that.

All right, these two guys
are still up on the bridge?

14:24.743 --> 14:25.905
- Yeah.
- CHRIS: So we know who they are,

what we came here to do.

14:31.562 --> 14:34.106
We can use some clothes and maybe a bag?

Why don't you tell me why
you're so cynical about romance?

14:58.553 --> 15:00.554
being in SWAT and being
in a relationship,

the two don't mesh.
