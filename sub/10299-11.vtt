01:17.901 --> 01:19.667
Why do we have go through
the family album

01:19.701 --> 01:21.733
and X out the dead guy?

01:21.767 --> 01:25.266
Well, Dad said it helps
at Christmastime.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.400
"Never send a present

01:26.434 --> 01:28.867
to someone who won't
send one back."

01:30.200 --> 01:32.967
Then we should X out
Mom and Dad.

01:33.934 --> 01:36.934
Soon enough, Kel.
Soon enough.

01:37.534 --> 01:39.233
<i>Well, I guess
it's buenos nachos</i>

01:39.267 --> 01:41.401
to Uncle Stymie.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.934
Yup. Uncle Stymie
was the only Bundy

01:43.968 --> 01:46.099
to have died of
natural causes.

01:46.133 --> 01:49.334
And to be named
after a Little Rascal.

01:50.334 --> 01:52.567
I can't believe
this guy's actually rich.

01:52.601 --> 01:53.900
Was he a real Bundy?

01:53.934 --> 01:55.800
Well, Dad explained it
to me.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.934
He was the only male Bundy
never to marry.

02:02.267 --> 02:04.567
I just hope Dad's
not too broken up over this.

02:04.601 --> 02:07.600
I mean, Uncle Stymie was
his favorite.

02:16.534 --> 02:19.600
Oh, God, why did it have
to be him?

02:19.634 --> 02:21.834
Why did it have
to be him?

02:21.868 --> 02:24.934
W- was that convincing, Peg?

02:24.968 --> 02:26.500
I wasn't pushing it
too much, was I?

02:26.534 --> 02:29.500
I mean, I don't wanna seem
greedy at the will reading.

02:29.534 --> 02:31.333
Well, then maybe
you shouldn't have asked

02:31.367 --> 02:34.099
for dibs
on his gold fillings.

02:34.133 --> 02:36.200
What do you think, Peg?
Hankie? No hankie?

02:36.234 --> 02:38.200
Uh, better no hankie.

02:38.234 --> 02:42.767
It's still crusty from that flu
that hit the family in '84.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.433
Hey, what do you think
your uncle was worth, Dad?

02:45.467 --> 02:47.733
Bud, how can you
put a worth

02:47.767 --> 02:50.934
on the life of a man
like Uncle Buckwheat?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.467
Stymie, Al.

02:55.501 --> 02:56.733
What's
the difference?

02:56.767 --> 02:59.533
Neither one of them
were germane to the plots.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.533
The point is
he saved all his money,

03:01.567 --> 03:02.633
and now, I'm gonna
get it.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.334
Let's go, Peg.

03:05.734 --> 03:06.934
Hey,
wait a minute.

03:06.968 --> 03:08.500
You two aren't going.

03:08.534 --> 03:09.667
Why?

03:09.701 --> 03:10.733
We loved Uncle Spanky

03:10.767 --> 03:13.434
just as much
as the next man.

03:13.968 --> 03:16.366
You don't even know
his name.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.700
Look, what Daddy means

03:17.734 --> 03:21.234
is that the sadness would just
be too much for you kids.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.700
They're not
coming back.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.767
They're taking the money
and leaving. I know it.

03:29.801 --> 03:32.266
Now, kids,
do you really think

03:32.300 --> 03:33.600
we could enjoy
this money

03:33.634 --> 03:36.600
without sharing it
with you?

03:38.934 --> 03:41.167
We're going
to this funeral.

03:41.968 --> 03:43.633
All right.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.500
But before you do,
I think we should all have

03:45.534 --> 03:48.366
a moment of silence
for our dear Uncle, uh...

03:48.400 --> 03:50.401
Gang.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.334
Amen.

04:02.634 --> 04:04.500
We've been had.

04:06.634 --> 04:08.633
"And so the legacy

04:08.667 --> 04:11.166
"I, Stymie C. Bundy,
leave you,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.366
"the last surviving
male Bundys,

04:13.400 --> 04:17.600
<i>"is proof that a male Bundy
can achieve greatness.</i>

04:17.634 --> 04:20.401
"Did I mention
that I never married?

04:20.901 --> 04:21.867
"Well, regardless,

04:21.901 --> 04:23.099
"I'm sure you men

04:23.133 --> 04:27.033
"have all become successful
in your own ways.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.900
"Iggy Bundy,

04:29.267 --> 04:30.233
"I'm sure you became

04:30.267 --> 04:33.366
"the astronaut
you dreamed of.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.700
"Lester Bundy,

04:35.734 --> 04:37.266
"I'm sure
you achieved your dream

04:37.300 --> 04:40.467
"of becoming
a brain surgeon.

04:40.501 --> 04:43.400
"Eugene Bundy,

04:43.434 --> 04:45.433
"I wonder if you
achieved your goal

04:45.467 --> 04:49.266
of becoming
bank president."

04:49.300 --> 04:51.500
I did.

04:51.534 --> 04:54.266
"And last,
and most certainly least,

04:54.300 --> 04:56.099
"Al Bundy.

04:56.133 --> 04:59.334
Al, get your hands
out of your pants."

05:04.467 --> 05:06.966
"You never really had
a dream,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.500
"but I only hope you had
the sense

05:08.534 --> 05:12.800
"to dump that wild redhead
who stole my wallet.

05:14.601 --> 05:16.233
"In conclusion,

05:16.267 --> 05:17.934
"rather than dividing
my estate

05:17.968 --> 05:19.999
"between all you vultures,

05:20.033 --> 05:23.133
I've decided to make
one Bundy really happy."

05:23.167 --> 05:26.368
If it's you, Al,
I really love you.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.301
If it's me, I--
I don't even know you.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.633
"Therefore,
it is my final wish

05:41.667 --> 05:44.867
"that the first couple
to give birth to a Bundy male

05:44.901 --> 05:46.999
"named after me

05:47.033 --> 05:49.468
"and born in wedlock...

05:50.901 --> 05:53.266
"will receive
my entire estate.

05:53.300 --> 05:58.134
That sum being $500,000."

06:11.567 --> 06:13.467
Uh, this may be
a stupid question,

06:13.501 --> 06:16.200
but why would you hide
your birth control pills?

06:16.234 --> 06:17.366
Safety precaution.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.366
Oh. Kelly.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.733
No. Al.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.166
Heh.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.667
He got ahold of them once.

06:23.701 --> 06:24.800
He thought
they were food

06:24.834 --> 06:27.300
I was hiding in my purse.

06:27.334 --> 06:29.366
So he ate them
while watching a ball game.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.467
Heh.

06:30.501 --> 06:32.133
You know, he actually kind
of liked it,

06:32.167 --> 06:34.533
because he didn't have to
shave for a month.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.166
I don't get it.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.433
Why take birth control,

06:38.467 --> 06:40.900
when you could
get 500,000 bucks

06:40.934 --> 06:42.800
for a Bundy baby boy?

06:42.834 --> 06:45.167
Plus what the zoo
would pay you for it.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.099
You know, I wouldn't
have another baby

06:49.133 --> 06:51.633
if gold dust dripped
out of its nose.

06:52.234 --> 06:54.300
I mean, sure,
the money would be nice,

06:54.334 --> 06:55.667
but I mean,
all that trouble.

06:55.701 --> 06:58.800
The screaming
and the crying and...

06:58.834 --> 07:02.600
changing those diapers
three or four times a week.

07:04.634 --> 07:08.433
Well, at least that left
your weekends free.

07:08.467 --> 07:09.966
You'd think. Heh.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.934
But I mean, you go away
for the weekend,

07:11.968 --> 07:12.934
and when you come home,

07:12.968 --> 07:16.800
they are never
where you left them.

07:16.834 --> 07:20.800
And then, of course, there's
that 10 months of pregnancy.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.334
Ten?

07:22.868 --> 07:25.500
Male Bundys never
wanna come out.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.333
Oh, and then once
they're out,

07:27.367 --> 07:29.834
they never wanna
go back in again.

07:36.534 --> 07:39.700
But, you know, for once,
Al is excited about sex.

07:39.734 --> 07:41.700
And I am not gonna dampen
his enthusiasm

07:41.734 --> 07:43.533
with little details.

07:45.367 --> 07:46.800
So let me get
this straight.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.633
You're turning down
half a mil

07:49.667 --> 07:51.966
to have sex with Al
for free.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.900
Mm-hm.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.767
Personally, I would rather
drive back and forth

07:57.801 --> 08:00.467
over a speed bump.

08:00.501 --> 08:02.166
But I guess
that's just me.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.166
And every other woman
in the world.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.567
By the way,
where is the stallion?

08:07.601 --> 08:11.200
<i>Oh, he's out buying Playboy,
Penthouse, Biker Babes, heh.</i>

08:11.234 --> 08:14.434
You know, a little gas
for the engine.

08:14.601 --> 08:15.834
How disgusting

08:15.868 --> 08:18.400
that a man should need
outside stimulation.

08:18.434 --> 08:21.667
It's so insulting
to a woman.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.366
Who do you think of
when you're with Al?

08:24.400 --> 08:26.567
James Bond.

08:27.434 --> 08:29.468
All of them.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.633
How about you?

08:31.667 --> 08:34.799
Oh, I like to keep
my fantasies simple.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.400
It starts with me in
a really tight, short dress

08:37.433 --> 08:40.265
at the end of a bar.

08:40.299 --> 08:41.332
At the other end,

08:41.366 --> 08:44.067
they're greasing up
Mike Tyson.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.133
He's shadowboxing
and starting to sweat.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.167
Then the scene changes.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.166
It's now
Madison Square Garden.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.166
A smoky crowd throbs
with anticipation.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.834
"Go, Marcie," they buzz.

08:59.868 --> 09:02.166
Tyson turns
into George Foreman,

09:02.200 --> 09:05.533
who eyes me
like a basket of muffins.

09:05.567 --> 09:06.834
The bell rings.

09:06.868 --> 09:09.533
I try to fight,
but I'm powerless.

09:09.567 --> 09:10.867
Then our eyes meet.

09:10.901 --> 09:13.200
He gives me
the old one-two.

09:13.234 --> 09:15.066
The crowd is
on its feet cheering.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.934
I'm down.
The count starts.

09:16.968 --> 09:19.733
The crowd's screaming,
"Get up!" But I can't.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.900
I won't!

09:22.868 --> 09:25.667
Take me, Mandingo!

09:33.000 --> 09:37.234
And then...sometimes I get
a little kinky.

09:37.734 --> 09:38.900
Peg...

09:38.934 --> 09:40.300
tonight your name
is Guinevere,

09:40.334 --> 09:42.600
and you were born in--
Yikes!

09:44.934 --> 09:46.099
Now look what
you've done.

09:46.133 --> 09:49.334
You might have
cost me $500,000.

09:50.133 --> 09:51.600
What are you
doing here?

09:51.634 --> 09:54.834
Collecting smells
for the poor.

09:54.868 --> 09:56.400
You have so much.

09:56.434 --> 09:58.999
Couldn't you please spare some
for those poor unfortunates

09:59.033 --> 10:01.600
who have no odor
to call their own?

10:01.634 --> 10:04.767
Peg, this is not
helping Lancelot.

10:04.801 --> 10:07.667
Marcie, I'll call you
when we're done.

10:07.701 --> 10:09.467
So you better run home
and get by the phone.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.500
It'll be ringing
in about a minute.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.700
Let's go, baby.

10:16.634 --> 10:18.200
Well, what's wrong,
honey?

10:18.234 --> 10:20.867
Marcie looked at me.

10:21.934 --> 10:24.600
I might be shot
for the night.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.700
I need some--

10:26.734 --> 10:29.533
I need some incentive.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.033
Incentive.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.600
Incentive.

10:32.634 --> 10:34.166
Okay.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.066
We're in
a boxing ring.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.633
You're George Foreman,
and I'm, uh--

10:38.667 --> 10:41.233
Oh, no, no, no.
That's my incentive.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.966
Okay. Uh, you want me
to run upstairs

10:43.000 --> 10:44.166
and put on
a garter belt?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.700
Ah...

10:45.734 --> 10:47.467
How about
my short pink teddy?

10:47.501 --> 10:50.201
You're not
helping me, Peg.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.834
I need some real incentive.

10:53.868 --> 10:55.667
Okay. Okay, honey,
I got it.

10:55.701 --> 10:57.366
Now, just picture this:

10:57.400 --> 10:59.099
you're sitting
on the couch

10:59.133 --> 11:01.767
in front of
a big-screen TV.

11:04.734 --> 11:05.900
Forty-inch?

11:05.934 --> 11:07.366
I wish.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.067
What?

11:13.734 --> 11:15.667
I mean, yeah.

11:15.701 --> 11:16.934
So there you are,

11:16.968 --> 11:18.733
in front
of this big-screen TV.

11:18.767 --> 11:23.233
And on top of it is
this nice, shiny VHS.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.834
Just look how clear
that picture is.

11:26.868 --> 11:30.500
Slow down, baby.
Slow down.

11:30.534 --> 11:33.300
And every machine
in this house

11:33.334 --> 11:38.301
is wired to one
remote control unit.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.834
And that remote
control

11:41.868 --> 11:45.134
is yours, big boy.

11:47.234 --> 11:50.500
Let's go, Peg.

11:51.634 --> 11:53.966
We got things to do,
eyes to blindfold,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.166
and babies to make.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.166
You know, it may not work
the first time, honey.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.767
I don't care.

12:00.801 --> 12:02.966
If it takes a million tries
and a million tears,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.834
that young'un
shall be yours.

12:05.868 --> 12:08.333
And that money
shall be mine.

12:08.367 --> 12:09.800
Come on, babe.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.468
Let's go die a little.

12:22.067 --> 12:23.133
"To test for pregnancy,

12:23.167 --> 12:26.333
mix sample A
with reagent B."

12:26.367 --> 12:28.800
What's reagent B?

12:29.467 --> 12:31.099
Hi, Daddy.
What you doing?

12:31.133 --> 12:33.767
Uh, nothing you need
to know about, honey.

12:33.801 --> 12:36.368
Oh, a home
pregnancy test.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.900
Let me show you.

12:40.734 --> 12:43.834
Now, you just fill
the dropper to the line...

12:43.868 --> 12:47.834
and then shake the mix
with the anti-HCG conjugate.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.733
Put it back
into the stand,

12:49.767 --> 12:51.333
add the litmus key...

12:51.367 --> 12:53.200
And if the test area--

12:53.234 --> 12:55.033
not the control area
-- turns blue,

12:55.067 --> 12:57.633
then you have
a positive reading.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.633
I, uh...

13:03.667 --> 13:06.533
<i>saw the professor do it
on Gilligan's Island.</i>

13:08.934 --> 13:10.966
Oh, well, that's okay.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.066
Now, it's clear.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.266
What does that mean?

13:13.300 --> 13:17.567
Well, it means that you
can still take PE.

13:19.734 --> 13:20.700
Al.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.301
Honey,
my temperature's up.

13:23.801 --> 13:24.834
I can't believe it.

13:24.868 --> 13:26.667
Two weeks, and she's
not pregnant yet.

13:26.701 --> 13:28.834
It's like having
two menial jobs.

13:31.701 --> 13:33.967
Having fun, Dad?
Go on with you.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.733
Any Bundys
get pregnant yet?

13:38.767 --> 13:39.733
Nope.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.966
Good. I still
got a shot.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.999
I just can't believe the babes
haven't been calling though.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.867
I mean, I'm offering
me and a half million.

13:47.901 --> 13:49.333
I mean, I'll even
marry the broad.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.733
What more could
a girl want?

13:50.767 --> 13:53.567
A spine-crushing accident?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.301
A bald spot?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.099
A weekend in Des Moines

13:58.133 --> 14:01.900
with Orville Redenbacher
and his really cool grandson?

14:08.601 --> 14:10.467
I know you're
just kidding.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.667
Because I'm cool.

14:13.334 --> 14:14.633
I am.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.533
I know I am.

14:16.567 --> 14:19.301
<i>I took the quiz
in Boys' Life.</i>

14:20.033 --> 14:21.033
Come on, Peg!

14:21.067 --> 14:23.133
Tell me what
I wanna hear, baby!

14:23.167 --> 14:26.133
Five hundred thousand
dollars, baby!

14:26.167 --> 14:28.101
Half a mil!

14:32.000 --> 14:33.934
What if they do have
another baby?

14:33.968 --> 14:35.500
It'll be so confusing.

14:35.534 --> 14:37.567
I mean, what would
that be to me?

14:37.601 --> 14:40.001
A tutor?

14:42.901 --> 14:45.233
Well, I hope
they don't do it.

14:45.267 --> 14:49.133
I remember before you hatched,
I used to get some attention.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.934
I like to think that
if you were never born,

14:50.968 --> 14:53.600
that I would have been
the one who was able to read.

14:54.834 --> 14:57.334
There, that should
have done it.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.066
<i>* He works hard
For the money *</i>

15:13.100 --> 15:16.667
<i>* So hard for it
Honey *</i>

15:16.701 --> 15:17.667
<i>* He works hard *</i>

15:17.701 --> 15:18.867
<i>* For the money *</i>

15:18.901 --> 15:20.166

15:20.200 --> 15:23.134
<i>* Treat him right *</i>

15:23.767 --> 15:27.200
<i>* He works hard

15:27.234 --> 15:30.767
<i>* So hard for it
Honey *</i>

15:30.801 --> 15:32.700
<i>* He works hard
For the money *</i>

15:32.734 --> 15:37.800
<i>* So you'd better
Treat him right *</i>

15:37.834 --> 15:38.800
<i>* He works hard *</i>

15:38.834 --> 15:40.066
<i>* For the money *</i>

15:40.100 --> 15:41.400
<i>* Hard for the money *</i>

15:41.434 --> 15:43.600
<i>* So hard for it
Honey *</i>

15:43.634 --> 15:44.800
<i>* Hard for it
Honey *</i>

15:44.834 --> 15:46.800
<i>* He works hard
For the money *</i>

15:46.834 --> 15:48.066
<i>* So you'd better *
* Better *</i>

15:48.100 --> 15:51.800
<i>* Treat him right *</i>

15:51.834 --> 15:54.033
<i>* He works hard, hard *
* Hard, hard *</i>

15:54.067 --> 15:55.834
<i>* Hard for the money *</i>

15:55.868 --> 15:57.400
<i>* Hard, hard *</i>

15:57.434 --> 15:58.867
<i>* Hard for it
Honey *</i>

15:58.901 --> 16:00.800
<i>* Hard for the money *</i>

16:00.834 --> 16:02.366
<i>* So you'd better *</i>

16:02.400 --> 16:04.434
<i>* Treat him right *</i>

16:06.000 --> 16:08.867
<i>* He works hard, hard, hard *</i>

16:08.901 --> 16:12.600
<i>* Hard, hard, hard, hard... *</i>

16:21.167 --> 16:23.066
Hi, Mom.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.066
What are you doing?

16:24.100 --> 16:27.033
Uh...
I'm, uh...

16:27.067 --> 16:29.366
taking fertility pills.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.767
There.
All fertile.

16:30.801 --> 16:32.066
Where's Daddy?

16:32.100 --> 16:34.066
Oh, uh, he's out back
getting some exercise.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.600
Hm.

16:48.534 --> 16:50.266
Al. Honey.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.567
My temperature is higher
than it's ever been.

16:56.501 --> 16:57.934
Daddy said he can't
do it anymore.

16:57.968 --> 17:00.233
You're killing him.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.667
Oh, come on, Al.
Just one more time.

17:02.701 --> 17:05.934
You'll never
have to do it again.

17:07.634 --> 17:10.201
Daddy says that he
can "snargly heathe."

17:12.567 --> 17:14.900
Hardly breathe.

17:16.267 --> 17:17.800
Al...

17:17.834 --> 17:20.999
It's half
a million dollars.

17:21.032 --> 17:24.532
<i>You could get cable
with that kind of money.</i>

17:26.534 --> 17:28.134
He says,
"Let's boogie."

17:30.501 --> 17:31.934
Do you want
your Gatorade, Daddy?

17:31.968 --> 17:34.234
Okay.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.001
Brace me.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.234
God, he's light
as a feather.

17:51.033 --> 17:51.999
Hello.

17:52.033 --> 17:54.301
I'm looking for
Mr. Al Bundy.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.301
I was Al Bundy.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.567
I'm personally letting
the heirs know

17:59.601 --> 18:01.133
that the race is over.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.500
Thank God.

18:02.534 --> 18:03.500
Who won?

18:03.534 --> 18:04.867
I did.

18:04.901 --> 18:06.033
You're not a Bundy.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.300
I am now.

18:07.334 --> 18:09.467
Right after the will reading,
I married Eugene.

18:09.501 --> 18:12.001
Come, Eugene.

18:14.133 --> 18:18.300
This is the product
Stymie, Jr.

18:18.334 --> 18:21.099
I got Eugene a kind of
work release program.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.333
And work he did.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.133
Honey, I'll--
I'll be out in six years.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.133
You-- ? You'll hold the money
for us, won't you?

18:27.167 --> 18:29.800
Of course, darling.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.999
Now, just don't get shot
trying to escape or something.

18:33.033 --> 18:35.633
Then what would I do?

18:39.667 --> 18:42.001
So long,
Uncle Eugene.

18:42.601 --> 18:43.567
Well,

18:43.601 --> 18:44.767
there's another fruitcake

18:44.801 --> 18:46.900
we won't have to
send at Christmas.

18:46.934 --> 18:48.867
Well, at least
it's over.

18:48.901 --> 18:49.966
But I don't get it.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.834
A thousand times,
and nothing.

18:51.868 --> 18:54.600
I barely touched her,
and I had you two.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.301
Well, at least
my appetite came back.

18:57.801 --> 19:00.700
Al, it's planting time.

19:00.734 --> 19:04.401
I'd like to plant a shovel
right between her barren eyes.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.333
But first, some food.

19:09.367 --> 19:12.767
Then I'll be able to watch TV
sitting up again.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.867
Hey,
I remember these.

19:14.901 --> 19:16.066
Tasty, crunchy.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.433
Good for snacking
right out of the box.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.400
Daddy, don't
eat those.

19:20.434 --> 19:21.999
Those are
birth control pills.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.867
No, they're not. They're
fertility pills.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.633
Mom's been
taking them.

19:29.901 --> 19:32.767
Al, I'm waiting.

19:34.801 --> 19:37.001
Leave me.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.066
Uh, Dad--

19:39.100 --> 19:41.334
Leave me.

19:44.634 --> 19:46.733
Be right there, punny.

19:46.767 --> 19:50.166
I- I just wanna check
your last test first.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.101
Gee, I hope
it's positive.

19:53.868 --> 19:56.633
Oh, I have a good feeling
about this one.

20:05.367 --> 20:06.333
Oh, for joy.

20:06.367 --> 20:07.966
For joy!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.867
We are blessed!

20:11.033 --> 20:13.133
We're what?

20:13.167 --> 20:15.333
We're what?

20:15.367 --> 20:17.166
We did it, babe.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.433
Well, that's
impossible.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.967
That can't be.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.133
I mean, not that I'm
not really happy. I--

20:23.167 --> 20:26.233
Oh, God.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.934
Ah, there, there,
my little baby oven.

20:28.968 --> 20:31.400
Don't you ever
touch me again.

20:31.434 --> 20:33.300
Oh.

20:33.334 --> 20:36.533
Diapers and doodie.

20:36.567 --> 20:38.700
Feed me. Wash me.

20:38.734 --> 20:41.600
Unlock my door.

20:41.634 --> 20:45.034
Oh, my life is
truly over.

20:47.167 --> 20:48.966
Well, at least
there's the money.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.934
Oh, honey.
I forgot to tell you.

20:50.968 --> 20:54.700
I found out today that
someone beat us to it.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.500
But, honey,
why should we worry?

20:59.534 --> 21:02.134
We have a love child
on the way.

21:03.567 --> 21:06.867
Wouldn't it be great
if we got twins?

21:07.367 --> 21:09.900
I feel fat!

21:09.934 --> 21:13.266
Oh, honey, that means
just more of you to love.

21:13.300 --> 21:16.001
Like 100 pounds.

21:16.801 --> 21:19.700
Gee, I hope you don't get
morning sickness again.

21:19.734 --> 21:23.600
You know. I-isn't it, like,
every day around this time?

21:23.634 --> 21:25.366
Gee, I don't feel
so good.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.999
Ah, it's gonna be
lots of fun.

21:28.033 --> 21:30.500
A- and you'll be beautiful,
what with that glow

21:30.534 --> 21:33.467
and the varicose veins, and...

21:33.501 --> 21:37.034
your nose swelling up
like a Christmas wino.

21:37.467 --> 21:39.633
But, honey, as I recall,

21:39.667 --> 21:42.133
pregnancy was the happiest
time of your life.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.166
Well, that
and the three years

21:44.200 --> 21:46.134
it took you to
lose the weight.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.867
Al, you are a pig.

21:48.901 --> 21:50.266
Yeah, but it won't be me
squealing

21:50.300 --> 21:53.167
those 40 hours
during labor.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.533
Wh-- ? What's
the matter, honey?

21:59.567 --> 22:01.066
You look kind
of pale.

22:01.100 --> 22:04.134
H- how about some nice
clams and peas?

22:11.634 --> 22:14.767
Eh, tomorrow, I'll shrink
all her clothes.

22:16.801 --> 22:19.800
Oh, mother of God!

22:22.767 --> 22:25.368
Yeah, you can't buy that
for half a mil.
