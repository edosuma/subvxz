00:06.246 --> 00:09.533
- How did Oscar's accident happen?
- They were climbing a tree.

00:09.648 --> 00:12.499
- Come on, what are you scared of?
- I'm not scared.

00:14.771 --> 00:16.707
Oscar, no!

00:16.713 --> 00:18.797
Alice is dangerous,
you have to stay away from her.

00:18.798 --> 00:21.074
In my universe,
you and I don't really talk.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.107
You were supposed to come to the police
with me. That detective won't listen to me!

00:24.113 --> 00:27.157
If you wanna charge us, then do it.
Otherwise we don't have to be here.

00:27.316 --> 00:29.472
- What's that?
- The 'other you' made it for Andy.

00:29.478 --> 00:32.378
The other me is sick-making.
What are you gonna do with it?

00:32.384 --> 00:33.853
I think it might help us reach Andy.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.349
Saskia didn't take the talisman.

00:35.355 --> 00:38.251
Isn't Alice the one that wants it?
You think they're working together?

00:38.257 --> 00:40.888
I wasn't supposed to like you.
It wasn't meant to be possible.

00:40.894 --> 00:43.769
From earth you came,
to earth return.

00:43.770 --> 00:44.898
Find Andy.

00:44.904 --> 00:46.809
- Run!
- We have to go!

00:47.155 --> 00:48.401
Saskia!

00:48.407 --> 00:51.235
- She's a golem! She was never real!
- I said shut up!

00:51.241 --> 00:54.887
Here's your precious talisman!
You better get Andy back with it!

Season 2, Episode 9

01:41.565 --> 01:44.565
Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:55.762 --> 01:57.791
Can we really talk to Andy with this?

01:57.797 --> 02:00.439
Strong magic opens a tear
between universes.

02:00.472 --> 02:04.587
And with your Water power as a conductor,
we should be able to see Andy again.

02:04.626 --> 02:07.003
"Should"...? No pressure!

02:07.009 --> 02:10.745
Oh, no, none. Totally relaxed here!

02:10.746 --> 02:13.774
- Ready?
- Let's do this.

02:15.532 --> 02:18.419
Water flows, water shows.

02:18.516 --> 02:21.284
Earth and air and fire glows.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.550
Come on, guys, concentrate.

02:28.556 --> 02:31.702
Water flows, water shows.

02:31.710 --> 02:34.761
Earth and air and fire glows.

02:36.610 --> 02:39.554
- Is that...?
- You're doing it!

02:40.087 --> 02:44.880
Water flows, water shows,
earth and air and fire glows.

02:50.479 --> 02:52.999
Andy! Andy!

02:53.147 --> 02:55.201
- Can you hear us?
- Look over, dude!

02:55.207 --> 02:57.167
- Guys!
- Andy!

02:57.299 --> 03:00.137
Dude, so good to see you!
Are you OK?

03:00.143 --> 03:02.596
- Where are you exactly?
- I don't know.

03:02.602 --> 03:06.175
But this place doesn't obey any
scientific principles that I know of.

03:06.176 --> 03:08.995
I saw something weird on the way
back from the other universe.

03:09.001 --> 03:11.696
It's a place where
magic has replaced physics.

03:11.702 --> 03:15.143
OK... Does this make no sense
or is my brain just full?

03:15.151 --> 03:18.555
- Full of what?
- OK, how do we get you out?

03:18.561 --> 03:23.342
- There are these holes, like this one.
- Could you go home through one?

03:23.348 --> 03:26.311
So far, they're more
like windows than doors.

03:26.317 --> 03:28.610
But if we could manipulate
them with a spell...

03:28.616 --> 03:31.396
He could just walk through.
Cool!

03:31.402 --> 03:36.241
Wait, how are you doing this without me?
Magic requires all four Elements.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.919
- That would be me.
- Ellen...

03:39.009 --> 03:41.706
- You have magical potential?
- Who knew, right?

03:41.712 --> 03:45.534
Yeah; we needed another Water Element
to do magic and turns out...

03:45.540 --> 03:50.571
Of course! Water is a conductor.
That's a means of communication.

03:51.453 --> 03:53.776
We always did have a connection.

03:55.090 --> 03:58.040
- So awkward...
- Yeah, anyway.

03:58.068 --> 04:01.096
Where do we find a spell
to turn a window into a door?

04:01.102 --> 04:03.683
If you got yourself there,
why can't you get yourself back?

04:03.689 --> 04:05.913
That wasn't me, that was...

04:07.254 --> 04:08.485
What's happening?

04:08.491 --> 04:11.489
It's not like this water power thing
came with instructions.

04:12.167 --> 04:16.111
- Who, Andy? Who sent you there?
- I'm trying...

04:18.303 --> 04:21.684
I heard... in my head...
a woman's voice.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.649
- A spell.
- Who?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.012
Andy!

04:25.805 --> 04:27.618
Something's blocking me.

04:33.335 --> 04:35.989
Not something - someone.

04:40.635 --> 04:44.532
- On a scale of one to not good, this is...
- Completely off the charts.

04:44.538 --> 04:46.792
Why would Alice not want us
to talk to Andy?

04:46.798 --> 04:51.121
- Because she put him there.
- It was <i>her</i> voice he heard.

04:51.655 --> 04:54.358
This is some seriously funky magic.

04:54.594 --> 04:57.073
She sabotages Andy
and destroys Saskia...

04:58.675 --> 05:00.165
She has to pay.

05:00.408 --> 05:01.926
Jake, don't!

05:09.438 --> 05:11.019
Jake, come back!

05:11.087 --> 05:13.046
Now, Jake!

05:14.873 --> 05:17.849
You're not gonna get away with this!

05:19.170 --> 05:20.861
Jake, come on!

05:25.639 --> 05:27.377
That was intense.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.966
That was incredibly stupid.

05:29.972 --> 05:31.199
You wanna do this now?!

05:31.205 --> 05:33.415
What, you get another swing at me,
like you did in the forest?

05:33.421 --> 05:35.476
How about we dial down
the man angst?

05:42.643 --> 05:45.619
We know where Andy is. Finally.

05:46.293 --> 05:47.803
We have to get him back.

05:47.809 --> 05:51.413
We can't get through Alice's storm.
She's blocking us.

05:51.446 --> 05:53.396
<i>Oscar.</i>

05:53.760 --> 05:56.055
- Did you hear that?
- What?

05:56.117 --> 05:57.638
<i>Oscar.</i>

05:57.639 --> 05:59.131
It's nothing.

05:59.348 --> 06:02.360
- What about Phoebe?
- I don't know, man.

06:02.366 --> 06:04.934
She'll help us, now we know
Alice did something to Andy.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.828
But she's not our Phoebe.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.013
Deep down, they're both the same person.
They have to be.

06:10.019 --> 06:11.630
Maybe you just want them to be.

06:11.636 --> 06:12.822
<i>Oscar!</i>

06:15.305 --> 06:17.770
Think about Rowland,
he's not the same.

06:17.776 --> 06:20.147
How many times
did the other Phoebe help us?

06:20.153 --> 06:22.750
She'll help us find the spell we need
to get Andy back.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.250
Fine, we start with her.

06:29.667 --> 06:33.588
- Hey, Alice is gone.
- We need to get to Phoebe while we can.

06:33.609 --> 06:34.873
Just do it.

06:37.087 --> 06:39.606
- Sorry, Oscar, too dangerous.
- But if you let me...

06:39.612 --> 06:43.604
- We'll let you know how it goes.
- Fine, why would today be any different?

06:48.210 --> 06:49.710
___

06:56.786 --> 06:59.376
Alice sure knows her way around
an electrical storm.

06:59.382 --> 07:01.880
- This is no ordinary storm.
- Meaning...?

07:01.901 --> 07:04.900
- She's got elemental powers too.
- Exactly.

07:04.901 --> 07:08.845
By the way, Alice is going down.

07:09.995 --> 07:13.010
- Jake!
- You should talk to him.

07:13.029 --> 07:15.705
He's kind of right.
Alice has gone too far.

07:15.722 --> 07:18.721
About Saskia. That's what
he's really cut up about.

07:18.791 --> 07:22.429
- Me and Jake talk about feelings?
- Seriously?!

07:22.435 --> 07:25.322
You can take on a scary demon,
but a heart-to-heart is terrifying?

07:25.328 --> 07:28.563
- Why don't you talk to him?
- He's your friend.

07:28.643 --> 07:32.792
We're not little kids anymore.
You really can talk about feelings.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.633
Or not.

07:38.074 --> 07:40.063
Hey, Jake, wait up a second!

07:45.111 --> 07:46.769
Jake! Jake!

07:46.890 --> 07:49.655
About Saskia, I should have been
a better friend...

07:49.661 --> 07:52.846
Mate, just don't. OK?

07:53.439 --> 07:56.763
You were right - she's not real.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.026
She <i>wasn't</i>... real.

08:01.809 --> 08:04.844
- Weird.
- I'm such a loser.

08:04.845 --> 08:08.885
She was a good person.
That, that was real.

08:12.106 --> 08:15.223
You seriously think that Ellen and
the boys are disappearing people?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.937
All these people went missing
the same way Andy did.

08:17.943 --> 08:20.683
And the boys are responsible?
Ellen too?

08:20.689 --> 08:23.722
They know something about it.
It's a conspiracy.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.845
You know that sounds crazy, right?

08:30.622 --> 08:33.691
You still like Sam.
No wonder you want to protect him.

08:33.697 --> 08:36.664
I'm not protecting anyone.
I've moved on.

08:45.246 --> 08:47.838
You're so annoyingly perfect
for each other.

08:47.889 --> 08:50.885
She's never gonna trust me again - ever.

08:56.721 --> 08:59.200
- We're leaving.
- Sam, we have to go.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.821
Uh, yeah!

09:18.983 --> 09:22.709
- How do we know Alice isn't here?
- We don't.

09:24.619 --> 09:26.508
Have you seen her?

09:29.958 --> 09:33.345
- I can't believe she'd go this far.
- Believe it.

09:34.220 --> 09:37.175
If she has her Book of Shadows with...

09:37.845 --> 09:39.901
Looks like it.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.787
Can you help us?

09:43.937 --> 09:45.059
Felix...

09:45.065 --> 09:48.159
I don't know why, but she's
stopping us from rescuing Andy.

09:48.175 --> 09:51.042
- You're our only hope.
- She's out of control.

09:53.984 --> 09:57.375
Well, a witch is nothing
without her Book of Shadows.

09:58.675 --> 10:02.638
- If we destroy it...
- How? She'd do anything to protect it.

10:02.639 --> 10:04.279
She'd have a spell.

10:04.285 --> 10:07.056
There is a spell that can overcome
a protection spell.

10:07.062 --> 10:11.143
But it needs both magic
and elemental powers combined.

10:12.151 --> 10:13.582
I'm in.

10:14.025 --> 10:18.164
- But where is her book?
- Well, wherever Alice is.

10:18.170 --> 10:20.197
Where would she go to lay low?

10:20.203 --> 10:24.258
T-there is a place...
We used to bushwalk there with Dad.

10:24.264 --> 10:27.827
- You? Bushwalking?
- Oh, because you're so outdoorsy?

10:28.005 --> 10:29.676
It's worth a crack.

10:32.675 --> 10:36.274
I-it's good.
Having you back.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.591
We've missed you.

10:39.675 --> 10:42.639
OK, don't get all creepy
on me, kiddo.

11:10.998 --> 11:12.719
Well done, Oscar.

11:14.231 --> 11:18.202
Alice...? You put this picture in my head?

11:18.372 --> 11:22.654
- You're not in any danger, Oscar.
- Yeah, well, I'm not scared of you.

11:22.905 --> 11:26.925
That would be more convincing if you
didn't look so desperate to get away.

11:28.064 --> 11:31.234
- I know what you did to Andy.
- I'm not the bad guy, Oscar.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.692
Yeah, you're trying to stop us
from helping Andy.

11:33.698 --> 11:35.462
It's not that simple.

11:36.357 --> 11:39.396
- I should go, this is...
- Felix doesn't see it, does he?

11:39.946 --> 11:43.607
- See what?
- How things could be different.

11:44.063 --> 11:46.601
You don't know a thing
about my brother or me.

11:46.607 --> 11:50.375
I know what it's like to have
a sibling who wants to keep you safe.

11:51.063 --> 11:54.119
But I also know what it feels like
to be...

11:54.554 --> 11:56.260
Suffocated.

11:56.788 --> 11:59.175
- Useless.
- I'm not useless.

11:59.181 --> 12:01.225
I see that.

12:04.938 --> 12:07.218
But what if you could walk again?

12:08.235 --> 12:10.816
Well, that's... that's impossible.

12:10.891 --> 12:13.168
What if I had a spell?

12:13.673 --> 12:15.576
I could make it happen.

12:17.675 --> 12:19.655
Would you let me help you?

12:31.562 --> 12:33.149
This way.

12:34.786 --> 12:36.124
Sure...?

12:36.506 --> 12:39.076
We came up here all the time
when we were kids.

12:42.599 --> 12:45.436
Hmm, happy families.

12:47.510 --> 12:50.570
Why do I feel like Hansel and Gretel?

12:52.413 --> 12:55.629
- What exactly are we looking for?
- A hide.

12:56.054 --> 12:57.670
Dad was into ornithology.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.674
- Into what?
- He was a bird watcher.

13:00.848 --> 13:05.094
Haven't been up here for years.
Might have been torn down.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.545
- So this is it?
- A magic shed?

13:16.481 --> 13:18.063
Bingo.

13:23.675 --> 13:25.835
Oh, spooky...

13:31.602 --> 13:33.475
Hey, Sam, it's you.

13:35.358 --> 13:37.750
Her book. Start looking.

13:51.793 --> 13:53.214
Gotcha!

13:56.868 --> 13:58.776
That's it, that's her book.

13:59.925 --> 14:03.124
- You won't regret this, Oscar.
- You're sure it'll work?

14:03.130 --> 14:05.392
You're sure I'll be able
to walk again?

14:05.398 --> 14:08.118
What's the first thing
that you're going to do?

14:08.554 --> 14:10.561
I'm... I'm gonna run.

14:10.619 --> 14:13.619
I'm gonna run and run and run
some more.

14:14.388 --> 14:16.344
Sounds like a plan.

14:18.169 --> 14:20.092
Whoa, what are you doing?

14:20.098 --> 14:23.615
A binding spell requires DNA
from those being bound.

14:27.675 --> 14:31.148
- A strand of my hair.
- And a strand of mine?

14:31.154 --> 14:33.457
- Exactly.
- To bind us?

14:33.501 --> 14:35.775
So the magic can be transferred
between us.

14:35.850 --> 14:39.655
- You power my legs with your magic?
- We do it together.

14:39.824 --> 14:42.159
If you're feeling brave enough.

14:43.445 --> 14:45.879
Just a little off the back, thanks.

14:50.501 --> 14:53.534
See...? Painless.

14:54.173 --> 14:57.204
Felix is gonna freak out
when he sees me walking.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.396
In a good way.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.076
I bet he does.

15:02.413 --> 15:03.735
Ready?

15:04.749 --> 15:06.870
Elements we call together.

15:06.877 --> 15:10.042
Erase the magic, quell forever.

15:10.048 --> 15:12.738
Elements that knit and bind.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.983
- That was your power, wasn't it?
- Did you see that too?

15:18.989 --> 15:20.185
It's OK, it's working.

15:20.191 --> 15:23.020
United, take the power away.

15:23.026 --> 15:25.642
Transform, make mortal.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.346
Elements that knit and bind...

15:27.352 --> 15:29.661
- Elements we call together.
- Hear my will.

15:29.667 --> 15:33.940
- Join different kinds.
- Erase the magic, quell forever!

15:34.832 --> 15:37.909
Unite as one and essence tie...

15:37.997 --> 15:41.627
Obey my call, none will deny!

15:46.203 --> 15:48.638
My toes, they're tingling.

15:48.639 --> 15:51.626
Be patient, this is powerful magic.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.000
You'll know when the time is right.

15:57.572 --> 16:01.161
- What happened?
- You turned it into a phonebook?

16:02.151 --> 16:03.937
It always was a phonebook.

16:03.943 --> 16:06.642
Alice enchanted it to look like
a Book of Shadows.

16:06.643 --> 16:10.409
- You're saying she played us?
- She was furious when I hid it.

16:10.459 --> 16:12.414
What do we do now?

16:12.603 --> 16:14.610
We... we try again.

16:14.611 --> 16:18.602
- Find Alice's real book.
- Any ideas on how we do that?

16:18.603 --> 16:20.004
Just one.

16:20.336 --> 16:23.133
- Oscar.
- Done, let's move.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.399
- What's happening with the generator?
- Yep, I'm on it!

16:31.405 --> 16:33.530
Detective? Detective.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.915
Viv, if this is about magic...

16:36.719 --> 16:38.675
I've been researching
missing persons.

16:38.676 --> 16:41.642
Jane Upton, William Quale,
Alice Hartley.

16:41.643 --> 16:43.646
All of them disappeared like Andy.

16:43.647 --> 16:45.792
Viv, I understand that
this is a difficult time...

16:45.798 --> 16:48.057
Please. Read the articles.

16:48.063 --> 16:51.330
Whatever happened to them,
happened to Andy.

16:55.356 --> 16:58.336
- No promises.
- Thank you.

17:01.538 --> 17:03.498
Generator's up!

17:46.296 --> 17:47.638
Osky, we need your help!

17:47.644 --> 17:49.625
- I have something to tell you.
- It can wait.

17:49.631 --> 17:52.469
- Actually, it's kind of important.
- We need you to draw where Alice is.

17:52.475 --> 17:55.257
- Yeah, but I need...
- Oscar, this is really important.

18:08.048 --> 18:10.575
Bound and shared.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.173
Together as one.

18:13.619 --> 18:17.266
Access my power -
limits undone.

18:20.675 --> 18:23.618
- Oscar.
- It's happening.

18:23.650 --> 18:24.994
What is?

18:25.752 --> 18:27.010
This.

18:33.176 --> 18:34.703
I can stand.

18:40.639 --> 18:43.830
- I'm walking!
- Yeah, I know! Osky, it's amazing!

18:43.836 --> 18:46.773
- Look at me, I...
- But... how?

18:48.647 --> 18:52.599
- Oscar, how did you do this?
- She just wanted to help.

18:53.297 --> 18:56.240
- Alice did this?
- You trusted <i>her?</i>

18:56.254 --> 18:58.706
Now you don't have to feel guilty
about the accident.

18:58.742 --> 19:01.414
- You don't have to worry about me anymore.
- Osky...

19:01.520 --> 19:02.986
<i>Oscar...</i>

19:03.133 --> 19:04.598
What's wrong?

19:04.757 --> 19:06.126
<i>The talisman...</i>

19:06.180 --> 19:07.777
What are you doing?

19:10.544 --> 19:13.260
- No!
- I don't know what's happening!

19:16.994 --> 19:20.523
Bound and shared.
Together as one.

19:20.635 --> 19:23.890
Access my power -
limits undone.

19:24.090 --> 19:28.599
Powered by me -
my will shall be done.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.724
- We'll never catch him.
- Dude, he's got some pace.

19:37.199 --> 19:40.874
- I can track his phone with mine!
- Don't you think that's a little creepy?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.771
Mum got tracking apps on our phone
when we got back.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.742
- Got him.
- Good one!

20:01.543 --> 20:03.499
I gotta call you back.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.392
There he is, straight ahead!

20:20.423 --> 20:23.914
- Come on, guys, we will lose him again!
- Felix, wait.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.504
He's taking us right
back to Alice's place.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.654
- So?
- So it's a trap!

20:29.655 --> 20:32.055
We have to think about this,
we need a plan.

20:32.061 --> 20:35.634
- There's no time, he's my brother!
- It's too dangerous, Felix.

20:35.949 --> 20:37.933
Then I'll have to go alone.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.322
Felix!

20:42.605 --> 20:44.216
Come on, Phoebe!

20:52.412 --> 20:54.639
- This way?
- No, no, that way!

20:57.376 --> 20:58.945
So outdoorsy!

22:02.675 --> 22:07.170
Up high you climb,
where you've been before.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.572
What's she doing?

22:10.341 --> 22:12.293
Oscar!

22:13.743 --> 22:16.363
- Bring him down!
- Felix, I'm sorry!

22:16.369 --> 22:19.992
- Alice! Alice, let the kid go.
- Phoebe, you don't understand.

22:19.998 --> 22:22.410
- Let him go!
- Not until I get the talisman!

22:22.416 --> 22:25.395
- No way!
- Up high you climb.

22:25.401 --> 22:27.881
- Where you've been before.
- Oscar, no!

22:27.887 --> 22:30.262
- She's making me, Felix!
- Oscar!

22:30.268 --> 22:33.369
This can't happen again. Phoebe!

22:33.375 --> 22:36.884
Doesn't have to be like this, Felix.
Just give it to me.

22:37.093 --> 22:38.596
Do something!

22:38.602 --> 22:41.181
- Give me the talisman.
- Stop this, Alice!

22:41.187 --> 22:44.892
- Felix, don't do it!
- Felix. What about Andy?

22:44.924 --> 22:48.590
- Just bring him down!
- Now, Felix!

22:50.815 --> 22:52.655
No longer as one.

22:52.656 --> 22:55.598
- My will is undone.
- What are you doing?

22:55.761 --> 22:57.105
Felix, help!

22:57.957 --> 23:01.429
Felix! Felix, my legs!
I can't hold on much longer!

23:01.435 --> 23:03.609
- Here! Here! Here!
- No! Felix!

23:03.933 --> 23:07.729
- Bring... him... down!
- You can't do this!

23:10.200 --> 23:14.356
No longer as one.
Your will is your own.

23:15.518 --> 23:16.928
No!

23:17.077 --> 23:18.422
No...!

23:18.952 --> 23:20.267
Halt!

23:26.024 --> 23:28.473
- He's not hurt.
- Oscar, Oscar.

23:28.557 --> 23:29.910
He's safe.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.598
I-I'm fine, I'm OK.

23:32.599 --> 23:35.663
- Felix, what were you thinking?
- He's my brother!

23:35.664 --> 23:38.081
Elements we call together.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.869
Erase the magic -
quell forever.

23:41.889 --> 23:44.104
- What is she doing?
- The spell!

24:00.618 --> 24:02.598
What have you done?!

24:09.606 --> 24:12.581
Roland.
Oh, man. Sprung again.

24:12.587 --> 24:16.043
That was quite an explosion.
How about you explain what that was?

24:16.049 --> 24:19.045
- We need a distraction.
- Like what?

24:20.087 --> 24:23.062
What has this got to do
with Andy Lau?

24:23.139 --> 24:27.460
Felix? I will prove
that you're involved!

24:27.513 --> 24:30.435
What is going on, Alice?
What's this really about?

24:30.441 --> 24:31.485
I'll show you.

24:31.491 --> 24:33.721
- It's an elemental thing.
- You're doing that?

24:33.727 --> 24:36.682
- You don't need a spell?
- What if you could too?

24:36.683 --> 24:39.564
- Never should have believed Alice.
- How could you have known?

24:39.570 --> 24:42.917
Not to trust Alice? Pretty sure most
of us could have figured that one out.

24:42.972 --> 24:44.139
Jake!

24:44.145 --> 24:47.213
What you did to Andy and Oscar
and Saskia, you're evil.

24:47.262 --> 24:49.298
- Please!
- Jake, we need their help!

24:49.304 --> 24:52.078
Roland saw the talisman explode,
he knows about magic!

24:52.084 --> 24:54.337
We need help with
a memory-wiping spell.
