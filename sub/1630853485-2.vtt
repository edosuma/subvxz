WEBVTT

00:11.320 --> 00:12.640
To new beginnings.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.400
And to our family, if and when.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.880
If and when.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.920
Since 9:47pm
we've had a complete blackout.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.880
Anyone trying to get in
falls instantly unconscious.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.560
Sir, London's sent someone.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.920
I have a daughter.
She's home on her own.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.040
She has health issues.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.520
Mum, where are you?

00:36.320 --> 00:37.480
I need you!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Canter on.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.400
Nice. Doing well.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.720
Whoa!

01:07.760 --> 01:09.760
Hey!

01:10.800 --> 01:12.960
Keep the knees in.
Yeah? Tell him you're there.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.400
I'm trying!
Are you all right, Ellie?

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
Ellie!

02:24.160 --> 02:25.320
I love you.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.840
Yeah, it's me.
I'm on my way there now.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.160
Arrange a meeting
for tomorrow at 2pm.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.600
Let London know.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.200
It was a freak event
that took the nation by surprise.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.480
But as the weeks pass, the small

03:02.520 --> 03:07.080
finds itself at last able to return
to some semblance of normality.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.760
The huge power surge...

03:20.240 --> 03:21.240
I love you.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.560
Jodie.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.680
What are you doing here?

03:31.720 --> 03:33.720
It's a police matter.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.320
Is it about that Twix
I stole from Smith's?

03:36.360 --> 03:38.120
It was 20 years ago
and I've eaten it.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.160
It's not about the Twix.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.160
Well, you'd better come in, then.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.640
Look, how long
is this going to take?

03:52.480 --> 03:56.560
Because Steve's coming round
and I need to tidy up and cook.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.880
Steve?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.320
Yeah, we're giving it another go.
Do you want tea?

04:01.280 --> 04:03.280
Why are you giving it another go?

04:03.320 --> 04:05.000
None of your business.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.320
You were a real bastard to me,
after the funeral.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.720
I was in grief too.
Maybe you didn't notice.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.600
Something's happened.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.240
To do with May 6th.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.560
I'm done talking about that night.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.560
Fucking police interviews,
journalists everywhere.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.200
I just want to live my life.

04:32.760 --> 04:36.160
Why are you back with Steve?
Any particular reason?

04:38.840 --> 04:40.840
What are you talking about?

04:43.280 --> 04:45.280
You know what I'm talking about.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.600
How the fuck do you know about that?

04:51.640 --> 04:53.200
Jodie, I need you to call Steve.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.640
You need to cancel tonight
and we need to talk.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.080
Because this is not
what you think it is.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.760
Are you ready yet?
Coming!

05:06.800 --> 05:07.800
Yeah.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.040
Sorry. Had to send the edit
on Laura's novel.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.360
Thanks for doing this.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.800
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
Take a seat.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
We have an appointment at 2pm.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.440
About our pregnancy.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.560
Yes, of course.
Um... Go through to D Wing.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.320
Ward 300.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.360
Oh, ignore the signs about
rebuilding.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.440
Are you sure this is right?

06:06.480 --> 06:08.480
It's what she said.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.520
Come on, we're late.
All right.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You OK?
Mm.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.160
Mr Clyde, listen to your girlfriend.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.920
This is not the same
as it was in London.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.760
I can feel life growing inside me.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.120
Oh, name, please?

06:38.160 --> 06:41.520
Zoe Moran. We have an appointment
with obstetrics at 2pm.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.440
And this is your partner?
Yeah, yeah.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.280
We are in the right place,
aren't we?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.320
Yes. Just go on through.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
What is this?

07:08.120 --> 07:10.120
Please, come in. Take a seat.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.800
Good afternoon, everyone.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.080
My name is Dr Colin McAfferty.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.880
And I am a senior advisor

07:27.920 --> 07:31.040
to the government's
Medical Response Council.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.880
And the reason
that you're here today

07:32.920 --> 07:36.360
is that DCI Haynes and I need
to talk to you about what happened

07:36.400 --> 07:40.360
on the night of Friday May 6th.

07:42.120 --> 07:46.160
We asked you here today, along with
a partner or someone that you trust.

07:47.040 --> 07:52.800
Because, as you will recall, our
medical teams took extensive tests

07:52.840 --> 07:56.320
from every victim
of the Midwich blackout.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.360
Our intention was to check that there
were no ongoing health concerns.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
And I'm happy to say
that there weren't.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.640
But what the tests did show

08:07.680 --> 08:11.600
is that something occurred
that night.

08:11.640 --> 08:17.360
It appears that
every woman of child-bearing age

08:17.400 --> 08:19.400
who was in the zone...

08:20.480 --> 08:24.040
it seems that
you've all fallen pregnant.

08:35.440 --> 08:41.160
We see no sign as yet that your
foetus is anything other than normal.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.720
But how this happened,
we... we do not yet know.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.320
What do you mean, you don't know?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.800
So you're saying it's...
What are you saying?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.280
If I could just finish.
Hold on a second.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.520
Are you implying we're
all pregnant for the same reason?

08:56.640 --> 09:01.520
Um... We can't say anything with
any medical certainty at this time.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.160
We will be conducting more tests
after the meeting.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.480
But you are saying something.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.600
You're making assumptions -
about my body.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.400
Is this a joke?

09:12.440 --> 09:14.680
It's not a joke.
Do you want me to go in?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.440
No. The local touch is better.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.240
This was always going to be the
tricky bit.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.280
We're therefore
drawn to date of conception

09:23.320 --> 09:25.000
to the night of the blackout.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.920
There must be some mistake.
There's no mistake.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.360
Excuse me,
this is nothing to do with us.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.360
Please sit down.
You can't tell us what to do.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.360
Well, I'm afraid I can.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.560
I know that this is a shock.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.280
But it is vitally important

09:48.240 --> 09:51.360
that what has happened to you
does not go outside of this room.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.160
For this reason,
we've brought you here together

09:53.200 --> 09:55.120
and before anything else happens,

09:55.160 --> 09:59.080
everyone here
must sign the Official Secrets Act.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.120
What?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.600
The blackout event
has been classified

10:03.640 --> 10:06.120
a national red level threat.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.000
It could be the result
of a hostile attack

10:14.040 --> 10:16.240
from a foreign or a domestic agent.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.280
Do you mean terrorism?

10:19.080 --> 10:22.280
I'm pregnant.
How can that be a hostile act?

10:23.200 --> 10:26.200
Some external force,
as yet unidentified,

10:26.240 --> 10:28.240
caused a major power cut that night.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.640
And may have also
caused you all to conceive.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.800
What about the power surge?

10:33.840 --> 10:36.000
There was a lightning strike.
You lied to us.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.840
Let's just stay calm.
Was there a lightning strike or not?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.360
Well, was there?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.520
Please. Please sit down.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.120
I went to my GP
and he told me my baby was normal.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.160
Is that a camera?

10:49.240 --> 10:52.320
I asked you a question.
Is that a camera?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.360
Yeah.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.760
Who's watching us?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.280
Answer the question.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.960
The police have been assigned
temporary extrajudicial powers

11:01.000 --> 11:02.560
by the Home Secretary.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.640
They're filming us!

11:04.680 --> 11:06.240
Can they do that?
No, they fucking can't!

11:06.760 --> 11:08.920
Calm down, Curtis.
Don't tell me what to do!

11:08.960 --> 11:11.120
Can you let us out that door now,
please?

11:11.520 --> 11:12.600
You, with me.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.640
What are you talking about?

11:16.400 --> 11:17.520
I'm calling a lawyer.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.040
My phone's not working.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.080
Nor mine.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.400
Have you blocked our phones?
What is going on?!

11:26.440 --> 11:28.240
They've blocked our phones.
What?!

11:28.280 --> 11:29.840
Yeah. Check your phone.
There's no signal.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.280
You can't do that. Rachel,
get your things. We're going.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.200
Sam, we're going too. Sorry, but
nobody leaves until this is done.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.800
Where did they come from?
Sit down.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.200
Jesus Christ. What is this? Just let
us out of here. Curtis, sit down.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.760
Could you ask the soldiers
to get away from the door?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.400
I have a feeling
they're not very helpful.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.840
I... I don't even know
who the hell you are.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm Susannah Zellaby.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.160
I know Rachel.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.800
It's true. Sit down.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.560
I'm a... a family therapist
here in the town.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.480
I'm also the mother of Cassie here,
who was in the zone that night.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.600
Five days ago, Cassie found out
that she was pregnant.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.760
She swore to me she had no idea
how it had happened.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.720
And I didn't believe her.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.120
Since then, a few women have
come to me with similar concerns.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.760
And it was then I started to wonder
if something strange had happened.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.440
I'll tell you what's happened.

12:31.480 --> 12:36.080
My... my partner and I made love
that night in my new home.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.880
And as a result
we have a baby coming.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.920
And this is nothing to do with it.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.720
Zoe, yes?
Yeah.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.720
Zoe, I would dearly love that
to be the case.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.120
But if every woman in this room
is pregnant,

12:51.160 --> 12:56.000
regardless of their sexual
orientation, sexual experience -

12:56.040 --> 12:58.480
That's not my problem.
Sam, let's go.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.440
Uh... I think most of you know me.
I'm hard to miss.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.000
But for those that don't,
I'm Mary-Ann.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.000
I work at Case
estate agents on the High Street.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.360
I asked my friend Sarah
to come with me today

13:11.400 --> 13:13.560
because I was scared
to come on my own.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.560
I'm pregnant and I haven't
had sex with a man for...years.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.360
That can't be true.
Trust me.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.920
What about artificial -
No.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.080
I don't believe you.
That's not helpful.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.720
It's all right, Sarah.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.880
You know, it may not make sense,
Zoe, but it is the truth.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.440
Yeah, well, maybe you got drunk
and forgot.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.960
Given the sexual desert
of my last couple of years, Curtis,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I think that is something
I would remember.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.920
What about you, Sarah?
Are you pregnant?

13:50.240 --> 13:52.400
I was out of town that night
with Charlotte.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.160
Otherwise, I think I might be.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.200
The...same is true for me.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.160
They're here.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.760
Bring them in.
Bring them in, please.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.560
There are some younger women
coming up with their parents.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.240
They were also in the zone
that night,

14:11.280 --> 14:14.600
some of them
at a house party on Lichfield Road.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.600
They're in the same situation

14:16.640 --> 14:18.680
but given that they were under 18
when it happened

14:18.720 --> 14:22.080
we thought it important
to speak to them individually first.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
Come on in. It's OK.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.320
Everyone knows what's going on.

14:32.760 --> 14:33.760
Please.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.200
I really need them to sign this.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
Listen, everyone.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.160
DCI Haynes wants us
to sign this piece of paper

14:55.200 --> 14:57.560
for our security and our protection.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.480
You don't have to do this.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.960
No-one here can make you
sign anything against your will.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.120
You are free to leave and go home.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.320
But one thing we must all accept.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.880
May 6th happened.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.080
And whether we like it or not,
we are all in this together now.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.560
So I will be signing,
if you wish to join me.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.800
Nora, isn't it?
Yeah.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.040
Mary-Ann.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.040
Bet that was one party
you wish you hadn't gone to.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.280
What is this for?

17:11.320 --> 17:12.720
It's an NIPT.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.480
We're looking to isolate
the foetal DNA from your own.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.520
Why?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.480
At just over seven weeks,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.720
the mother's blood contains
small levels of the baby's DNA

17:22.760 --> 17:23.960
which is excreted
through the placenta.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.880
But why are you doing this?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.880
We do it for a variety of reasons.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.800
But one thing we do want
to do is test for paternal DNA.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.120
Paternal DNA?

17:35.160 --> 17:37.160
We're looking to isolate
the foetal DNA.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.200
It's an NIPT.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.640
We're looking to isolate
the foetal DNA from your own.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.760
Dr Zellaby.

18:00.280 --> 18:05.520
Sorry. It's a bad habit.
I had given up but...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Free country last time I looked.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.280
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.320
Have you got a moment?
Yeah.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.640
I wanted to say...
so sorry for your loss.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.760
If there's anything I can do...

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
Just through here.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.440
Thanks.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.240
Dr Zellaby.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.280
Bernard Westcott, Home Office.
How do you do?

18:36.560 --> 18:38.240
How do you do?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.280
Shall we use my office?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.400
We're still locating
all of the women affected.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.520
We expect mostly terminations

19:01.560 --> 19:03.920
but we are anticipating
a small percentage

19:03.960 --> 19:06.000
may choose to keep the child.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.520
Those women
may need psychological support.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.640
I hope you're not asking me to report
back on personal consultations.

19:14.680 --> 19:15.880
That would be unethical.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.960
We just want you to help
the mothers on their journey.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Like you did today.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.240
And we're willing to pay you
to do so.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.280
One of those mothers is my daughter.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.360
Surely that's a positive.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.960
Well, you'll have an insight
none of us could possibly share.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.800
Let me be frank, Dr Zellaby.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.120
An entirely unexplained phenomenon
has occurred.

19:41.160 --> 19:45.720
We have a responsibility to
protect not just the women concerned

19:45.760 --> 19:47.320
but all of us.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.440
We should use every tool
at our disposal.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.360
Wouldn't you agree?

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Susannah?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.600
Before you go...

20:09.200 --> 20:12.280
There is one thing that came up
on your background checks.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.760
May 1999. Your daughter, Cassie.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.640
What about it?

20:18.680 --> 20:21.200
I just wanted to ask you
a few questions about that time,

20:21.240 --> 20:22.280
if that's all right?

20:55.760 --> 20:57.760
Maybe this was a bad idea.
No.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I need to face it.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.560
Let me show you the room.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.160
Paul.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.240
You should know
I'm going to keep the baby.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.120
I think I have to.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.640
Can you understand that?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.920
Well, it's your choice.
I know it's my choice.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.960
I'm asking if you understand.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.200
Are you OK?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.960
Honestly... I don't know
how to answer that question.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
Brought you a tea.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.520
How are you feeling?
Is this my free session?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.120
Paid for by the government.
No, I'm just asking you how you are.

23:14.640 --> 23:19.480
It's...disturbing
and it's OK to say so.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.560
Actually,
it all kind of makes sense.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.240
Yeah.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.280
I knew that night
had to be for something.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.120
The way that I felt, right after.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.000
I couldn't put it into words.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.040
But now I...

23:41.320 --> 23:45.560
It... it felt like I was visited.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.520
Have you read the pamphlet?

23:57.080 --> 23:59.080
Yeah, I've read it.

24:04.960 --> 24:09.440
Cassie this...
this isn't an ordinary situation.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.960
And you have to ask yourself
if you are ready for this.

24:13.960 --> 24:18.160
I'm here of course, always,
but is that what you want?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.520
To be reliant on me?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.960
Just say it.
You want me to get rid of it.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.600
You don't think that I can cope.
No, that's not what I said.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.800
That's what you meant, though,
isn't it?

24:27.840 --> 24:30.920
You don't think
that I'm mother material.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.040
Oh, Cassie, don't.

24:32.080 --> 24:36.680
I get one thing.
One thing of my own.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.600
I understand.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
And you'll send a letter?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.040
Thank you.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.160
Who was that?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
The hospital.
They've got the test results.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
And?

25:12.200 --> 25:15.080
The baby has my DNA but not yours.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.880
Apparently there's no evidence
of paternal DNA of any kind.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
The woman said
as you're not the father,

25:28.240 --> 25:30.200
you don't have the same legal
rights.

25:30.560 --> 25:34.680
So we have to sign something
to ascribe those rights to you,

25:34.720 --> 25:36.720
if you want to.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.600
This is bullshit.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.080
I'm with you.
It's OK.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.560
I'm getting rid of it.
Where's that letter? No!

25:51.920 --> 25:55.000
It's not what we wanted.
We wanted OUR child.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.840
Zoe, listen to me. That doctor
gave us a less than 1% chance.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.680
That's why we came here.
Change of environment...

26:01.720 --> 26:03.960
Yeah, it worked. It worked.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.760
Not... not how I wanted.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.960
But it might be
the best chance we get.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.360
So please don't get rid of it.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
Please.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
For me,
it's a matter of my religion.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.400
I'm as disturbed by this as anyone.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.440
But I won't interrupt God's work.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.400
I don't expect everyone to agree.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.920
But for me,
it's an article of faith.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.880
No, Sam is being amazing.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.920
He's feeding me huge suppers.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.800
The baby's good.
The scan was normal.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.120
No need for amnio
or anything like that.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.520
Yes, I am sleeping fine.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.560
It's all fine.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.440
I can't explain it. It's like
this weird fucking miracle.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.360
Hello, sweetheart.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
Go on, Charlotte.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.760
Oh, my God, you're the Virgin Mary.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.200
Definitely not a virgin.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.320
Who's messaging you?

27:41.800 --> 27:44.720
Uh... It's just
someone from the council.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.640
Can we play?

27:49.680 --> 27:50.680
Sure.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.120
Excuse me. Can I help?

28:01.160 --> 28:03.160
No, I know where I'm going.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.480
Miss Stone? We got your call.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.080
Is anyone with you?
No.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.120
Anyone coming to pick you up?

28:15.160 --> 28:19.160
Um... Listen, I've...done this
before so let's just get it done.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.640
Of course.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.320
Please sit down and
wait for your name to be called.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.360
Are you not with anyone?

28:38.400 --> 28:42.480
My mum can't cope.
It's too weird for her.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.720
It's too weird for all of us.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.760
Hm.

28:51.800 --> 28:55.600
My mate Sadie tried posting
about the whole thing on Facebook.

28:55.640 --> 28:58.400
It got taken down.
The police came round.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.880
Yeah.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.040
We're being watched all the time.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.080
I don't want anything to do with it.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.160
If you'd like
to take a seat through here.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.120
And wait for your name to be called.
OK. Thank you.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
Hi.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.040
I didn't know anyone else
would be here.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.600
Well, I guess it's more efficient.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.840
Cassandra Stone?

29:44.400 --> 29:48.000
So, Cassie, you've thought about
keeping the baby but decided against.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.040
Is that correct?
Yeah.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.840
And you've made that decision
yourself?

29:51.880 --> 29:52.880
Yeah.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
OK, so you'll be taking two pills.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.480
The first will block
the main pregnancy hormone

29:59.520 --> 30:01.920
and the second will induce
the breakdown of the pregnancy.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.680
Due to the unusual nature
of the pregnancy,

30:05.720 --> 30:08.360
we'll administer the pills here
and monitor you during the process.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.320
If you can just sign the consent
form, we'll get everything ready.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.840
You've thought about having the baby
and have decided against.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.200
Is that correct?
Yes, that's right.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.920
And you made that decision yourself?

30:30.960 --> 30:32.960
Yes, in consultation
with my husband.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.720
Just wait through here,
Mrs Saunders.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.240
Sign this consent form
and we'll get everything ready.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.280
Thanks.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.440
Sign this consent form
and we'll get everything ready.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.400
Thank you.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.760
OK, Miss Stone?

32:11.800 --> 32:13.800
It's happened again.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.000
As you can see, with
Kilmorey Avenue you get more garden,

33:39.040 --> 33:40.560
a little less living space.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.960
It's all a matter of taste, Aisha,
but I personally think its a peach.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.480
Come any time. Even in winter,
it's always a trip worth making.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.960
Your brother
is going to love you so much.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.000
I've still got
another two months to go,

34:01.040 --> 34:03.200
although you wouldn't think it
to look at me.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.400
Ma'am.

34:56.520 --> 35:01.040
..for the
09:56 service to London Marylebone

35:01.080 --> 35:05.320
calling at Great Missenden,
Amersham, Chalfont and Latimer,

35:05.360 --> 35:10.200
Chorleywood, Rickmansworth, Harrow
on the Hill and London Marylebone.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.320
This train is formed
of five carriages.

35:13.360 --> 35:18.880
Platform 1 for the 09:56 service
to London Marylebone...

36:12.120 --> 36:14.120
Sorry about this.
No, not at all.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
I'm glad you called.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.560
Cassie's got a friend here
but they're upstairs

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
so we can talk in my study.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.760
Would you like a cup of tea?

36:31.320 --> 36:33.320
Ugh, there it is again.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.920
What are you going to call her?

36:41.400 --> 36:43.400
I was thinking about...Eve.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.960
The first woman.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.040
What?

36:52.080 --> 36:54.080
It's too mystical for me.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.200
Hey, stranger.

37:09.240 --> 37:11.240
Hey! How are you?

37:11.640 --> 37:13.040
Haven't seen you around.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.160
Uh, well,
I went to Croydon for a bit

37:15.200 --> 37:17.200
but it just didn't feel right,
you know?

37:17.240 --> 37:18.680
So where are you staying?

37:18.720 --> 37:22.080
I'm just with Paul for now.
OK. Mm.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.720
It's only temporary. I'm going
to look for my own place soon.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.240
Well, you know where to come.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.920
We've got a lovely two-bed
in Drakesford Avenue. £600 a month.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.440
Oh. Yeah, that sounds great.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.720
How can we be so bloody heavy?

37:38.120 --> 37:41.000
We've still got six weeks to go.
They shouldn't be this big.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.000
Mum says it's weird.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.760
Well, your mum
thinks everything's weird.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.800
That is so true.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.360
Oh... Laters, babe.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.320
Come tomorrow?

38:07.400 --> 38:12.400
I was at the station and
I just couldn't get on the train.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.840
Well, a pregnant body
can behave like that.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.360
The chemical changes are extreme.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.000
No.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.040
This is different.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.880
It controlled my body, Susannah.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.160
It?

38:30.200 --> 38:31.200
Yes.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.360
It doesn't want me to go to work.
It just wants me to be here.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.280
It's like it has a will of its own.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.920
Having chicken?
Yeah, it's an old family classic.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.080
I can't find any of the spices,
though, so I'm having to improvise.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.480
Ooh!

38:55.520 --> 38:57.400
Argh!
You OK?

38:57.440 --> 38:59.440
Uh... Yeah.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.560
OK. Stay calm.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.960
Have you got that number?
Yeah, it's on my phone.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.680
Oh... It's so early, though.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.600
They said it might come early,
remember?

39:07.640 --> 39:09.240
Let's tell them
you're on your way in

39:09.280 --> 39:11.200
then we'll call Paul
and he can pick you up.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.240
We'll call outside. Walk with me.
OK.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.840
