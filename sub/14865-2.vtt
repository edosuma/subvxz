WEBVTT

02:25.938 --> 02:27.394
Come on!

02:28.190 --> 02:30.602
This way!

02:30.735 --> 02:32.817
Come on, quickly!

02:32.945 --> 02:35.152
Move! Move!

03:00.765 --> 03:01.800
No!

03:05.269 --> 03:07.885
Out of the way! Move!

03:10.775 --> 03:13.858
Evil inside. Evil...

03:13.986 --> 03:15.692
Vai!

03:30.544 --> 03:33.786
— Give us a kiss, then.
- You shave, | kiss.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.044
You talk to him?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.171
I said lwould, and lwill.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.013
We cannot stay here forever.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.427
It's not right.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.677
— This place is a house of death.
- I know.

03:49.814 --> 03:54.308
What if we make a baby here?
Gods forbid. It would be a monster.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.947
I said I'd talk to him.

04:11.502 --> 04:15.666
How are you, brother?
Good day out?

04:15.798 --> 04:18.164
Good day for a walk
in the country maybe?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.006
No.

04:20.136 --> 04:23.219
Spring's here,
blossom on the trees,

04:23.347 --> 04:25.212
lambs in the meadows.

04:26.308 --> 04:29.846
Brother, the full moon
has come and gone.

04:29.979 --> 04:33.346
Maybe it's time to cut off
these mourning beards?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.689
Life must continue.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.487
You're right.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.399
- You should go.
— And leave you here like this?

04:45.536 --> 04:48.699
— Good friend I'd be.
— l'm past need of friends.

04:48.831 --> 04:51.573
Now what's that mean?
What are you going to do?

04:51.709 --> 04:53.290
You can't sit here the rest of your life.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.956
l've caused the death of my wife.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.579
l've caused the death of my children.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.002
l have caused the death of Caesar.

05:01.135 --> 05:03.592
What would you have me do now?

05:03.721 --> 05:06.178
What? Run a butcher's shop?

05:06.307 --> 05:09.799
Fine, fine. Sorry I spoke.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.551
Eat your damn porridge.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.817
What sort of woman is she?

05:19.945 --> 05:22.436
— Who?
— The Egyptian girl.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.861
Oh, her. I barely met her.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.076
Skinny thing. Talks too much.

05:29.205 --> 05:30.911
Well, she must have something

05:31.040 --> 05:33.156
to lure a cold fish like Caesar.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.123
She's a queen.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.744
Caesar would've fucked Medusa
if she'd worn a crown.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.079
You jealous, flower?

05:41.217 --> 05:43.333
Of course.
I don't mind your whores,

05:43.469 --> 05:46.006
but I don't want you
making love to her sort.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.550
Meaning younger women
of higher rank than...

05:48.682 --> 05:50.013
you?

05:50.142 --> 05:52.053
That's a good general rule.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.801
I shall remember it.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.929
I love you.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.442
Antony?

06:04.740 --> 06:06.150
A word, if I may.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.989
What is it, dear boy?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.985
About my money, Caesar's money.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.622
You assured me I'd have it by now.

06:12.748 --> 06:15.956
I'm so sorry. lt slipped my mind.
I will see to it.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.827
Good, only that is what you've said
several times now.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.329
Well, these things take time.

06:21.465 --> 06:24.753
We are talking vast sums of money.

06:24.885 --> 06:29.003
There's a great deal of paperwork
and lawyering to be done and...

06:29.139 --> 06:31.300
So when can I expect
transfer to my control?

06:31.433 --> 06:32.388
What's the rush?

06:32.518 --> 06:35.305
Some wicked woman
giving you the squeeze?

06:35.437 --> 06:37.928
Don't worry. I'll see to it.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.192
Tolerable voyage?

06:47.324 --> 06:50.236
- It was.
— Myself...

06:50.369 --> 06:53.532
I cannot abide ships and boats.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.030
Too much like cages, ne?

06:56.166 --> 06:59.124
With the added risk of drowning.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.380
You've changed since we last met.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.921
Have I seen you before?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.673
Yes.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.173
ln Alexandria, with Caesar.

07:14.310 --> 07:18.223
It's those uniforms you wear.
You all look alike.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.391
When I saw you then,
you seemed...

07:20.524 --> 07:21.934
happier.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.566
Is something wrong?

07:24.695 --> 07:28.313
A strange question. Caesar is dead.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.319
He was as a husband to me.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.031
l was as a wife to him.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.827
— l amuse you.
- Forgive me.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.950
It's an odd thought.

07:41.879 --> 07:45.667
A Roman consul
with a 'Gyptian wife.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.882
— Wouldn't do, you know?
— I fail to see why.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.219
I believe we may begin negotiations.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.589
Here is the text of our proposal.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.717
We would read it
into the Senate record.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.771
"| Mark Antony, Consul of Rome,

08:02.900 --> 08:05.232
"guarantee that our armies will continue

08:05.361 --> 08:08.273
"to protect and preserve
the throne of Cleopatra,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.612
"child of Ptolemy, Queen of Egypt,

08:10.741 --> 08:12.777
"mistress of sedge and bee,
et cetera."

08:12.910 --> 08:16.152
- What is your price?
— Her majesty will guarantee

08:16.288 --> 08:18.700
ten grain shipments a month
at the standard rate,

08:18.832 --> 08:23.246
from which revenues the Consul
will accept as a personal gift

08:23.379 --> 08:25.620
48,000 denarii a month.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.801
42.

08:31.095 --> 08:34.258
42, delivered on the calends.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.552
Are we done, then?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.891
One more thing.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.269
My son by Caesar
is near four years old.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.363
He has begun to ask
questions about his father.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.574
How touching.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.659
He's too young to understand now,

08:57.788 --> 08:59.244
but soon I must tell him

08:59.373 --> 09:02.080
that his father's people
do not accept him.

09:03.419 --> 09:05.580
Not as a true legal son.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.750
It will never happen.
The people wouldn't like it.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.089
We have no political design,

09:11.927 --> 09:14.134
merely the happiness of my boy.

09:15.681 --> 09:19.173
A simple public declaration

09:19.309 --> 09:21.095
of paternity will suffice.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.935
And what would I profit by that?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.348
You would have my eternal gratitude.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.112
Promise me...

09:42.833 --> 09:44.789
That's possible.

09:53.719 --> 09:57.553
Declare my boy
a lawful son of Caesar,

09:57.681 --> 09:59.137
then we shall be friends.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.131
— You don't trust me?
- Not so much.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.554
You have a changeable look about you.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.678
You're mistaken.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.396
Steady as a priest of Saturn, me.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.981
Come now.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.978
It is not permitted to touch.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.785
Nice manners...

10:21.914 --> 10:23.870
for a whore.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.460
If I must prostitute myself

10:34.593 --> 10:37.756
for the good of my country and my family,

10:37.888 --> 10:40.254
|wi||.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.382
But the customer pays first, does he not?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.430
Your son will eat shit and die

10:46.563 --> 10:48.394
before I make him legal.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.890
You see?

10:52.027 --> 10:53.483
Very changeable.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.734
Sorry we couldn't agree.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.573
Perhaps you'll change your mind.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.570
We'll see you at dinner
tomorrow, I believe.

11:33.277 --> 11:35.142
He wasn't Apollo, by no means,

11:35.279 --> 11:38.191
but when Erastes Fulmen was alive

11:38.323 --> 11:40.314
there was peace on the Aventine.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.659
Now every gang in the city's
fighting for control of the hill.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.951
Every day there's violence,
every day there's...

11:48.083 --> 11:49.744
hoo—ha.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.993
— lt's killing commerce.
- I will see to it.

11:52.129 --> 11:55.792
And is not commerce
the root of civic virtue?

11:55.924 --> 12:00.042
Can Rome long survive
if commerce is...

12:01.138 --> 12:02.127
You may go.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.182
Something...

12:08.312 --> 12:10.849
Something must be done
on the Aventine.

12:10.981 --> 12:14.064
Yes, yes, I know.
I hear of nothing else.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.478
The gangs will not stop fighting
of their own accord.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.603
It is too rich a prize.
Whoever controls the Aventine

12:18.739 --> 12:20.570
controls the docks
and the grain supply...

12:20.699 --> 12:23.031
- I am aware!
— The violence will spread.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.492
If it is not stopped,
the whole city will swift descend

12:25.621 --> 12:29.660
into chaos and famine
and you will be blamed, I'm afraid.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.874
Though it'd be none of
your fault, of course. Still...

12:33.003 --> 12:34.584
I will handle it.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.704
Now...

12:37.841 --> 12:38.956
what can I do for you?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.754
— You sent for me.
— Oh, yes, that.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.548
Show him.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.976
It appears to be a list of every
dishonest rascal in the city.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.609
Very droll.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.067
It is a list of candidates
for next year's elections

12:59.196 --> 13:02.563
drawn up by our beloved Caesar
just before he was taken from us.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.190
Posca found it amongst his papers.

13:05.327 --> 13:08.945
Another lucky find?
You are prodigious, Posca.

13:09.081 --> 13:12.118
I want your endorsement
of the names.

13:12.250 --> 13:16.243
For the sake of unity and amity,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.462
Isn't that being just a little too brazen?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.081
Who would believe that Caesar
chose such wretches?

13:21.218 --> 13:25.052
Surely you don't think those men
paid me to put their names on the list?

13:25.180 --> 13:26.795
Not at all.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.422
I expect they have paid Posca.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.425
- So, what's the problem?
— My endorsement will be worthless.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.724
People will merely assume
I've been intimidated by you.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.313
— Are you not intimidated?
- Not especially.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.603
At present,
you cannot afford to kill me.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.068
You need me to run the Senate.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.609
Today, I need you.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.574
- Tomorrow...
— Then tomorrow I will worry.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.786
Today, | suggest you let me strike
the worst scoundrels off this list.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.415
Then I will endorse it.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.374
Fine, fine. Do as you like.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.076
A pleasure as always.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.500
Next there is a delegation...

14:04.636 --> 14:07.753
No, enough. Enough of this.
Call my guard.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.425
Immediately. Before you go,

14:09.558 --> 14:12.140
if I might raise the matter
of my recompense and commission?

14:12.269 --> 14:15.386
No! No, you might not,
you wretched Greek thief!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.353
Money, money, money.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.098
l'm surrounded by money—grubbers.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.572
Mark Antony, sir! It's me, sir!

14:27.701 --> 14:29.282
Titus Pullo of the 13th!

14:29.411 --> 14:30.992
Legionary Pullo?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.611
Hold it. Let him through.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.454
Sir!

14:34.583 --> 14:35.948
What are you doing here?

14:36.084 --> 14:39.167
Requiring advice and counsel
regarding Lucius Vorenus, sir.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.161
Go on.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.959
He has gone awry, sir.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.299
I don't know what's to be done with him.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.803
Vorenus! Officers afoot!

14:53.935 --> 14:56.768
Centurion Vorenus.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.513
— As was.
- Sir?

15:03.070 --> 15:05.527
Look at the fucking state of you.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.146
— lt's mourning dress, sir...
- Mourning?

15:08.283 --> 15:10.615
You may well mourn.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.359
Caesar is dead,

15:12.496 --> 15:15.329
and it was you as
good as held the knife.

15:15.457 --> 15:18.494
Stand to fucking attention
when I'm talking to you!

15:22.547 --> 15:26.631
You know that your name
is disgraced forever?

15:26.760 --> 15:29.547
I do, sir.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.091
"I do, sir."

15:33.975 --> 15:36.762
Why, then, are you still alive?

15:41.858 --> 15:45.100
Why have you not done your damn duty

15:45.237 --> 15:47.944
and opened your stomach?

15:49.491 --> 15:52.028
I would like that above all things, sir.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.573
But Dis is my master,

15:55.705 --> 15:57.957
and he will take me when he chooses.

16:00.085 --> 16:04.078
At present, he wishes me
to suffer here on this earth.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.542
You are wrong, Centurion.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.720
Dis is not your master.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.387
I am your master.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.642
By sacred oath under the standards

16:22.774 --> 16:24.310
of the 13th.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.943
Sir.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.376
And this, ltake it,
was Erastes Fulmen.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.835
I told him to get rid,

16:45.964 --> 16:48.626
but it calms him
to look at the thing.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.500
Not content to let our great father die,

16:51.636 --> 16:54.127
you start a damn war on the Aventine

16:54.264 --> 16:57.927
that threatens to engulf
the whole fucking city.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.396
Now...

17:14.117 --> 17:17.826
would you like a chance
to redeem yourself, Centurion?

17:22.626 --> 17:24.787
There's no redemption.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.290
No man is beyond redemption, Lucius.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.839
Not even you.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.772
And so?

18:00.247 --> 18:01.157
And so?

18:01.289 --> 18:03.245
The Egyptian girl. Tell all.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.366
Well, she was naked

18:05.502 --> 18:07.458
before the priests had left the room.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.828
I had to call my people to pull her off me.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.331
Seriously.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.798
She was in mourning.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.636
She was very grey and formal.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.004
She was quite the little mouse.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.007
On Jupiter's stone?

18:22.143 --> 18:23.679
On Juno's cunt.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.355
Nothing at all interesting happened.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.896
Oh, she did ask me to formally recognise

18:32.028 --> 18:33.939
her bastard as Caesar's son.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.733
Blasted impudence!

18:35.865 --> 18:38.026
You refused, of course.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.774
Octavian is the only...

18:39.911 --> 18:41.947
Yes, yes, of course I refused.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.287
Which set off a great flood

18:44.416 --> 18:46.702
of royal whining.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.752
No, it's been a pig of a day all around.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.339
Running this damn city isn't nearly
as amusing as I thought it would be.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.457
Poor lamb.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.594
More tedium to follow

18:59.723 --> 19:01.930
at this damn dinner tomorrow, no doubt.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.757
ls Servilia coming, by any chance?

19:04.894 --> 19:05.974
Yes.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.558
Good.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.102
Have you ever been bitten

19:15.238 --> 19:17.570
by a moray eel?

19:17.699 --> 19:18.939
I should think not.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.868
Where's your mother?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.875
— Something wrong?
- Possibly.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.635
Juno's mercy.
What's she doing here?

20:29.771 --> 20:32.729
I suppose Antony
wants a show of unity

20:32.857 --> 20:34.688
for the Egyptians.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.651
Servilia, my love,
it's good of you to come.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.526
I am here under protest.
Mark Antony's insistence.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.365
He's a terrible bully, isn't he?

20:44.494 --> 20:46.576
You must be very scared.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.569
Not in the slightest.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.118
Well, you need have no fear of me.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.833
| wish you no harm, truly.

20:53.962 --> 20:57.295
It's enough for me to know that
l have won and you've been humbled.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.914
We've both suffered enough.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.507
You are mocking me, I believe.

21:01.636 --> 21:05.220
Not at all.
I'm offering you friendship

21:05.348 --> 21:07.088
and reconciliation.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.967
What do you say?

21:10.103 --> 21:12.845
Two friends together?

21:16.526 --> 21:18.767
I cannot honourably refuse.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.894
I'm so happy.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.357
Kiss me, my dear.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.372
Enjoy the party.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.965
Did you see the look
on her face? Priceless.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.551
Mother, I saw Timon
and some of his men in the yard.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.420
Knife—and—hatchet men.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.798
- So?
— l was wondering what they're doing here.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.925
Security, what else?

21:52.061 --> 21:54.723
Their obvious purpose would be
the abduction and killing of Servilia

21:54.856 --> 21:57.142
— as she leaves this evening.
- That's absurd.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.937
There's a truce ratified by priests.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.196
— You can't harm her.
- A truce? Priests?

22:02.322 --> 22:03.607
You think that bitch cares?

22:03.740 --> 22:07.107
Mother, there is more at stake here
than your desire for vengeance.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.780
The political situation
is extremely delicate.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.778
Her death would throw
the Republic into uproar.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.577
— I don't care.
— You're being childish.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.700
Does Antony know of this?

22:17.921 --> 22:19.411
Of course he does.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.798
All right, he doesn't, obviously.
And don't you dare tell him.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.509
I'm sorry, Mother.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.094
You little bastard.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.102
I won't be needing you.
You can go now.

22:47.659 --> 22:50.901
Where is your damned Egyptian?
It's time to serve dinner.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.494
l have a good mind to cancel
the whole damn thing.

22:53.623 --> 22:56.490
Don't sulk, you know you're in the wrong.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.836
Just as you described her.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.840
Quite the little mouse.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.689
Cleopatra Philopator,

23:21.818 --> 23:25.276
mistress of sedge and bee,

23:25.405 --> 23:27.691
queen of both upper
and lower kingdoms.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.689
Please...

23:30.743 --> 23:32.404
We shall be informal.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.618
We shall act as if we were all equals.

23:38.835 --> 23:42.544
It's much more fun that way,
don't you think?

23:42.672 --> 23:47.132
Now, who are all these lovely people?

23:49.053 --> 23:50.714
Our hostess,

23:50.847 --> 23:52.633
Atia of the Julii.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.721
Atia.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.512
Your Highness.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.052
Nice...

23:59.188 --> 24:00.803
just as you said.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.021
Come here, boy.

24:08.656 --> 24:12.274
This is my darling Caesarion.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.112
Does he not look
exactly like his noble father?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.573
Uncanny.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.451
Looks nothing like him.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.788
Shall we eat?

25:35.118 --> 25:37.325
You're back.
I thought you'd be late.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.489
— Here I am.
— You'll never guess...

25:43.126 --> 25:45.492
— Tevye!
- Levi?

25:45.628 --> 25:47.835
Release me now, children.
Let me hug your father.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.295
Why are you here?

25:49.424 --> 25:51.210
So happy to see your brother.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.752
You gave me a start, that's all.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.342
I'm very happy to see you.
You could've written.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.756
Forgive me.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.266
I caught a ship on the tide's turn. Here I am.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.758
Look at you!
How long's it been? Eight years?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.885
Nine. What brings you here?

26:04.021 --> 26:07.309
My partners and l are
setting up a new business.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.898
I'm to run the office here.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.358
— You'll be staying a while, then?
— If you'll have me.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.523
Of course.
Our house is your house.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.362
Why haven't you made him dinner?

26:15.491 --> 26:17.277
No, that's all right. I'm not hungry.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.525
We're not kosher.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.698
Already we're not good enough?

26:21.831 --> 26:25.164
— Well, have some wine at least.
- Now you're talking.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.700
So, you're still in spices?

26:27.837 --> 26:30.374
Spices, cloth, oil. Thank you.

26:30.506 --> 26:34.875
- Goes well, I hope?
— Oh, up, down, up, down.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.626
It goes.

26:37.597 --> 26:40.304
And you? Deborah tells me
you're doing very well.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.469
Oh, up, down.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.352
Horses?

26:49.025 --> 26:50.890
Horses.

26:54.864 --> 26:57.947
Consul, farewell.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.487
Your vassal queen shall weep

27:00.620 --> 27:02.702
till she sees you again.

27:02.830 --> 27:06.322
I shall see you soon, then, I hope.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.915
Atia,

27:08.044 --> 27:11.002
l have made a friend for life.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.210
| feel it.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.505
Indeed.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.799
Kiss me.

27:22.517 --> 27:25.509
Die screaming,
you pig—spawn trollop.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.893
Safe journey, Your Highness.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.324
Well, I'm glad that's...

27:42.453 --> 27:46.571
Party's over!
Everybody can go home now!

28:06.602 --> 28:09.685
So tell me the truth now.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.145
Why are you here?

28:11.274 --> 28:13.060
I told you, I'm just
setting up a new business.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.980
You hate Rome. You hate Romans.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.695
How many times did you tell me
what scum they are?

28:19.824 --> 28:22.907
Vile oppressors,
Babylonian whores.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.072
And now you've come to live
amongst them. I don't think so.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.242
Business is business.
This is where the money is.

28:34.422 --> 28:38.290
Things were getting
a little hot for me in Jerusalem.

28:38.426 --> 28:39.916
Better I leave for a while.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.304
— Things? What things?
— Politics.

28:43.598 --> 28:45.259
Nothing serious.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.052
Maybe I spoke a little too freely.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.312
— Oh, brother.
— How is a man to stay silent?

28:50.438 --> 28:53.350
Our so—called leaders
lick the boots of Roman soldiers.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.609
— The Pharisees are...
— You listen to me.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.943
You're in Rome now. In my house.
I've a wife and children to think of.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.483
You keep that cack to yourself.
Do you hear me?

29:04.118 --> 29:05.824
Ihearyou.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.655
All right, then.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.993
Hold him down.

29:25.014 --> 29:26.504
Take him out.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.599
He's dead.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.922
Would you do me a small favour?

29:59.048 --> 30:00.959
Go back and tell my friend

30:01.092 --> 30:03.253
that I have given up
trying to reason with him.

30:03.386 --> 30:06.344
Everything on the Aventine
above Persephone's Oak

30:06.472 --> 30:08.178
is my territory now.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.763
If he touches any man of mine again,

30:09.892 --> 30:13.100
there's a grave danger
that I will become irate, and if I do...

30:13.229 --> 30:16.471
Captains and men of the collegia.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.769
Under the auspices of Mother Concord,

30:19.902 --> 30:22.769
a sanctified truce is declared.

30:22.905 --> 30:27.399
Violence shall cease
until the waxing of the moon.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.951
At the sixth hour

30:31.080 --> 30:33.617
all captains are summoned

30:33.749 --> 30:35.410
to attend a parley

30:35.543 --> 30:38.250
at the Aventine collegium.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.467
What the fuck's all this, then?

31:36.604 --> 31:39.687
- I don't know.
— Who called a parley?

31:39.815 --> 31:42.306
- Nobody knows.
— The priest must know.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.729
— You can't talk to a priest of Concord.
- Why not?

31:44.862 --> 31:47.695
Because you can't, you fucking savage.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.655
Foreigners.

31:53.788 --> 31:55.995
What's going on?

32:14.016 --> 32:16.257
My name is Lucius Vorenus.

32:16.393 --> 32:19.260
I speak to you
under the authorisation

32:19.396 --> 32:22.229
of Mark Antony, Consul of Rome.

32:22.358 --> 32:25.771
Captains, follow me.

32:25.903 --> 32:29.020
You'll hear something to your benefit.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.068
Come on, then.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.384
Consul Mark Antony declares your contest

32:56.517 --> 32:58.428
for control of the Aventine is finished.

32:58.561 --> 33:01.303
- All violence will cease.
— He can declare what he likes.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.564
It doesn't make it so.

33:02.690 --> 33:04.897
As killer of Erastes Fulmen,

33:05.025 --> 33:07.892
I claim his captaincy
of the Aventine collegium

33:08.028 --> 33:09.939
as my rightful spoils.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.108
The Aventine is now mine.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.983
— You can't do that.
- Yet here I am.

33:15.119 --> 33:18.111
You can have this old rat's nest if you like,
but you've got no men.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.738
They're all dead or run away.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.285
I'll find men.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.283
Rome has no shortage of criminal scum.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.661
Maybe I'll take some of yours.

33:26.797 --> 33:29.174
Brothers, remember the lady.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.795
We all know of you, Lucius Vorenus.

33:32.928 --> 33:36.637
We know you're a man of gravity
and we're duly respectful.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.256
You would do well
to return that respect.

33:39.393 --> 33:42.055
I can't do that,
but I can give you coin instead.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.144
Once order is restored,

33:44.273 --> 33:48.061
all collegia will receive
a monthly stipend of 5,000 denarii

33:48.194 --> 33:51.152
directly from Consul Mark Antony
under my supervision.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.235
In return,

33:52.364 --> 33:55.982
he expects you will limit yourself
to your traditional liberties and malpractices.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.985
Nothing that will disrupt trade or politics.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.486
Anything else?

34:00.623 --> 34:03.080
Naturally, should there be civil violence,

34:03.209 --> 34:05.495
you and your people will be called upon

34:05.628 --> 34:08.791
to defend the rights of the Consul.

34:08.923 --> 34:11.289
I require your acknowledgement

34:11.425 --> 34:13.666
and acceptance of these terms.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.588
5,000 denarii...

34:16.805 --> 34:18.056
that's not bad.

34:18.182 --> 34:19.217
In cash or grain?

34:19.350 --> 34:21.261
— As you like.
— Are you women?

34:21.393 --> 34:25.636
One bark from this red dog
and you bend your neck.

34:25.773 --> 34:26.979
What's your name?

34:27.107 --> 34:29.519
Gaius Ignus Acerbo,

34:29.652 --> 34:31.688
Captain of the Oppian colleges.

34:31.820 --> 34:36.484
Tell us, why would sane
and respectable men like ourselves

34:36.617 --> 34:41.782
do business with a poor, cursed,
hounded beast like you?

34:42.790 --> 34:45.748
Gaius Ignus Acerbo,

34:45.876 --> 34:48.083
you ask a fair question.

34:48.212 --> 34:52.080
Those of you who will not
do business with me are my enemy.

34:52.841 --> 34:53.830
And so?

34:53.968 --> 34:56.209
They will die much sooner
than they expect.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.552
Steady on.
Remember blessed Concord.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.387
No menaces.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.809
Concord.

35:46.270 --> 35:49.433
I am a son of Hades!

35:50.607 --> 35:54.065
I fuck Concord in her arse!

36:07.166 --> 36:09.782
— The truce is raised!
— Brother!

36:16.675 --> 36:18.916
Acerbo, will you do business with me?

36:24.975 --> 36:26.135
Yes, it's funny, isn't it?

36:26.310 --> 36:30.644
I warn you, woman, another word about
that damn girl and I will...

36:30.773 --> 36:33.139
You will what? What will you do?

36:36.236 --> 36:38.318
Fighting again?

36:38.447 --> 36:40.483
How tiresome.

36:40.616 --> 36:43.653
I never touched that woman!

36:43.786 --> 36:46.323
So you keep saying.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.447
— Good morning.
— Good morning.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.333
Antony, about my money...

36:57.466 --> 36:59.707
Oh, gods beneath us. I...

36:59.843 --> 37:02.880
- Not now, Octavian.
— Has the matter moved fonNard at all?

37:03.013 --> 37:05.299
Tell me, boy,
if I did give you the money,

37:05.432 --> 37:09.266
what on Gaia's great arse
would you do with it?

37:09.395 --> 37:10.350
That's a complex question,

37:10.479 --> 37:13.892
but I'd certainly start by giving the plebs
the money that Caesar promised them.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.355
Then you're a fool.

37:15.484 --> 37:18.271
Basic politics, lad.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.692
Once they have the money
and spend it,

37:21.824 --> 37:23.860
then they will want more money.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.653
And what are you gonna do then?

37:25.786 --> 37:28.448
I was afraid you'd take this attitude,
so I've engaged a lawyer.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.116
A lawyer.

37:30.249 --> 37:33.491
He can help Posca expedite the delay
in transferring the money to me.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.834
What were you thinking?
Antony's family.

37:35.963 --> 37:37.874
He's not, actually.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.542
All right, boy,

37:39.675 --> 37:41.882
you can tell your lawyer

37:42.010 --> 37:44.387
to shove a taper up his arse

37:44.513 --> 37:45.969
and set himself alight.

37:46.098 --> 37:49.431
You'll not get
one brass obol of that money.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.640
Nothing.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.181
Come on, my love.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.267
Brother, will you pass the fruit salad?

38:03.198 --> 38:04.699
See what you've done?

38:04.825 --> 38:06.941
I'm sorry if I've
disturbed your love affair.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.033
- I merely...
— Oh, shut up, you fool.

38:09.163 --> 38:10.903
Love affair be damned.

38:11.039 --> 38:15.078
You will apologise and promise
to stop all this talk about money.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.543
Tell him that you're perfectly happy
for him to administer Caesar's estate.

38:18.672 --> 38:21.334
- But I'm not happy.
— Do you think I am?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.879
What choice do we have?

38:24.011 --> 38:27.048
Don't you see
we're dependent on Antony now?

38:28.223 --> 38:30.430
Who will protect us if you drive him
away from me? Who?

38:30.559 --> 38:33.676
— I'm perfectly capable.
- Please don't.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.020
Mark Antony buggers boys like you
for a morning snack.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.225
You will apologise,
and there's an end on it.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.611
There's not enough figs in this salad.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.130
That's enough!

39:12.267 --> 39:14.724
Vai. Vai!

39:14.853 --> 39:17.765
Off with you! Vai!

39:20.400 --> 39:21.389
Thank you, sir.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.313
Please, sir, I need work.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.155
I'll do anything.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.947
I'll suck your cock.

39:34.248 --> 39:37.740
Why are you making all this fuss
over the money?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.741
It was obvious
he'd never give it to you.

39:39.878 --> 39:43.086
All you're doing
is making Mother anxious.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.831
Sister,

39:45.968 --> 39:49.256
you must promise me never to speak
of what I tell you now.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.594
Oh, gods.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.470
I promise.

39:56.812 --> 39:59.554
The Republic is on the brink of an abyss.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.397
Antony... Antony's
a destructive brute.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.642
The Senate is weak and cowardly,

40:04.778 --> 40:07.690
and the plebs are roiling
in want and anger.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.235
Rome is in need of new leadership.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.358
I can provide that leadership.

40:12.494 --> 40:15.327
Now, I already have
several initiatives un...

40:28.176 --> 40:31.839
It'll come to no good,
this Hades business.

40:31.972 --> 40:35.430
Worked though, didn't it?
The bastards fell into line.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.641
You scared the fuck
out of them right enough,

40:37.769 --> 40:39.930
but that's not the point.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.019
You're no son of Hades.
You're a mortal man.

40:42.149 --> 40:44.014
The gods don't like this sort of shit
from mortal men.

40:44.151 --> 40:47.234
I'm following the orders of
a consul of Rome, my master by oath,

40:47.362 --> 40:52.277
for the sake of peace and public order,
for the good of the Republic.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.406
Are you with me or not?

40:58.582 --> 41:00.618
I'm with you.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.099
By grace of Jupiter,
Gaius Octavian Caesar,

41:19.227 --> 41:21.843
lawful son of Gaius Julius Caesar,

41:21.980 --> 41:23.845
makes this his pledge

41:23.982 --> 41:26.439
that he personally will fulfil the terms

41:26.568 --> 41:31.107
of his beloved father's
bequest to the people.

41:31.239 --> 41:34.481
In the fields of Mars next nine days,

41:34.618 --> 41:37.860
all eligible citizens and soldiers

41:37.996 --> 41:41.079
will receive 300 sestertii

41:41.208 --> 41:44.541
from the hands of
Octavian Caesar himself!

41:45.337 --> 41:49.831
Let it be known
that Caesar's son has sold away

41:49.966 --> 41:51.672
all his own property

41:51.802 --> 41:53.838
to honour his father's wishes.

41:53.970 --> 41:58.009
May such piety
bring blessings upon him.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.768
— What have you done?
- Wake up!

42:04.189 --> 42:05.599
Wake up at once!

42:05.732 --> 42:07.108
What is the meaning of this?

42:07.234 --> 42:08.519
- What?
— The money!

42:08.652 --> 42:10.608
You're giving the plebs their money!

42:11.196 --> 42:13.653
Is it so late already?

42:14.741 --> 42:15.981
I've overslept.

42:16.118 --> 42:18.279
I don't care.
What about the money?

42:18.412 --> 42:20.323
I've promised it.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.241
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before now.

42:22.374 --> 42:25.286
But I knew you'd object.

42:25.419 --> 42:27.330
I've decided to enter public life.

42:27.462 --> 42:30.875
This seemed the best way
to introduce myself to the people.

42:31.007 --> 42:35.091
That will be seen as
a direct challenge to me.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.428
Yes, but that isn't
my intention at all.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.890
I suggest we make a public display
of unity to quash such notions.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.304
A public display of unity!

42:44.438 --> 42:47.805
It makes sense.
Our interests are conjoined.

42:47.941 --> 42:50.523
While you are consul,
my name will lend weight to yours.

42:50.652 --> 42:52.233
And when your consulship is over,

42:52.362 --> 42:54.648
and you retire from politics
as you have promised,

42:54.781 --> 42:56.897
I will step in as leader
of the Caesarian party.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.239
I see.

42:58.368 --> 43:01.110
You will need protection
from your enemies in the Senate,

43:01.246 --> 43:03.658
and I can provide that.

43:06.585 --> 43:09.292
Just who the fuck
do you think you are?

43:09.421 --> 43:12.629
— I'm Caesar's rightful heir.
— Nowjust stay calm.

43:12.758 --> 43:16.216
He doesn't have the money,
so he can't give it away, can he?

43:16.344 --> 43:17.845
This is all just childish talk.

43:17.971 --> 43:19.677
The money is legally mine.

43:19.806 --> 43:22.047
I was able to borrow against it.

43:22.184 --> 43:24.596
— Borrow?
— Borrow?

43:24.728 --> 43:26.559
How much did you borrow?

43:26.688 --> 43:30.226
It's not so much
in the great scheme of things.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.859
How much?

43:32.527 --> 43:34.188
Three million sestertii.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.528
Juno's cunt!

43:43.663 --> 43:47.201
You stupid, stupid boy!

43:49.211 --> 43:51.202
You...

44:06.269 --> 44:08.055
You stupid little shit!

44:08.188 --> 44:09.769
Fucking whore!

44:18.532 --> 44:19.942
Apologise! Apologise.

44:20.075 --> 44:21.656
That's it, now. Just leave it now.

44:21.785 --> 44:23.946
— Apologise!
— No!

44:26.790 --> 44:29.532
No, enough.

44:37.551 --> 44:39.041
Little fuck.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.588
Antony!

44:46.601 --> 44:48.808
Stop it!

44:48.937 --> 44:50.598
Antony, leave him!

44:52.148 --> 44:54.309
Leave him. Leave him.
Leave him. Look at me!

44:54.442 --> 44:56.694
Look at me! Look at me!

44:56.820 --> 44:58.731
Stop it!

44:58.864 --> 45:00.229
Stop it.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.321
Juno's mercy!

45:03.285 --> 45:05.776
What's the matter with you?

45:06.788 --> 45:08.494
You're lucky you're breathing!

45:08.623 --> 45:10.204
— Do you hear me, boy?
- Come on.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.665
— You're lucky you're breathing!
— Animal!

45:12.794 --> 45:14.705
You're not fit to lead Rome!

45:31.062 --> 45:32.393
Who are you, then?

45:34.149 --> 45:37.516
Slave of the college brothel
over by three bells.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.688
Sorry, love, we've plenty of whores.

45:39.821 --> 45:42.312
No, I'm no whore.

45:43.450 --> 45:44.530
You gonna make me guess?

45:44.659 --> 45:49.619
Supervisor. I handle the girls,
keep the customers in line.

45:49.748 --> 45:50.908
Name?

45:51.041 --> 45:52.622
Romans call me Gaia.

45:52.751 --> 45:55.208
What do your own people call you?

45:55.337 --> 45:58.124
— Not your business.
- Fair enough.

45:58.256 --> 46:01.043
I get my own room, I eat what I want.

46:01.176 --> 46:04.339
Every 500 coins that comes
through the brothel, I get one.

46:04.471 --> 46:07.213
— Saving up to buy your freedom, are you?
— No.

46:07.349 --> 46:08.714
A fur coat.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.771
Sign her up.

46:14.981 --> 46:16.312
Thanks, boss.

46:38.213 --> 46:39.419
Brother Mascius.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.926
Pullo, you black dog.

46:44.052 --> 46:46.168
You're still alive?

46:47.555 --> 46:49.056
You've come to join up, then?

46:50.350 --> 46:51.635
I heard you were hiring.

46:51.768 --> 46:54.635
Oh, I thought you were well set,
farm and all.

46:54.771 --> 46:57.012
Oh, crooked dice done for that.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.434
— Shame.
— What can you do?

46:59.567 --> 47:02.104
Didn't like farming much anyway.

47:03.196 --> 47:06.029
Be sure about this, brother.
It's a dark road we're on.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.239
No one knows where it will lead.

47:08.368 --> 47:10.324
All roads lead to
the same place, don't they?

47:10.453 --> 47:11.784
That they do.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.536
Glad to have you with us.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.406
Come through the back
and say hello to Vorenus,

47:16.543 --> 47:19.080
— cheer up the old bastard.
- Is it true what they say?

47:19.212 --> 47:21.624
— About the wife and children?
— True enough.

47:21.756 --> 47:24.372
Not a fucking word.

47:35.145 --> 47:38.558
— Brother Vorenus.
— Mascius, how are you?

47:43.194 --> 47:44.309
I'm fair. Fair.

47:44.446 --> 47:46.027
Come to join our merry band.

47:47.323 --> 47:48.654
You tried to warn him off, did you?

47:48.783 --> 47:50.319
Idid.

47:50.452 --> 47:52.443
This isn't the army, brother.

47:52.579 --> 47:55.662
We here, we're pimps,

47:55.790 --> 47:57.826
knifemen, thieves.

47:57.959 --> 47:59.790
Are you sure you've sunk so low?

48:01.129 --> 48:03.996
I walked here from Capua.
I slept in ditches.

48:04.132 --> 48:07.920
When I get here, I hear people talking.

48:09.137 --> 48:10.673
They say a black—hearted villain

48:10.805 --> 48:12.591
has taken over the Aventine college.

48:12.724 --> 48:16.387
He's in league with
the gods below, they say.

48:16.519 --> 48:19.431
And his name is Lucius Vorenus.

48:19.564 --> 48:23.307
Well, I thought to myself,
"Mascius, old boy,

48:27.030 --> 48:28.986
See, Pullo, ltold you
I know what I'm about.

48:29.115 --> 48:32.027
It's not right. The gods don't like it.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.616
Yeah.

48:33.745 --> 48:36.407
What more can the gods do to me?

48:36.539 --> 48:38.200
How can they punish me now?

48:39.209 --> 48:40.619
Don't know.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.743
Don't wanna find out.

48:47.133 --> 48:49.124
Have you heard the good news?

48:51.179 --> 48:52.885
Ihave.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.050
This is the beginning of the end for them.

48:55.183 --> 48:58.220
From your lips
to the ears of the gods.

48:58.353 --> 49:00.810
A fool like Antony was sure to blunder.

49:00.939 --> 49:03.726
They'll fight among themselves
and destroy each other.

49:03.858 --> 49:06.440
I doubt the boy will be
more than a nuisance to Antony.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.230
He cannot hope to rival him.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.695
Caesar did not
choose the boy on a whim.

49:10.824 --> 49:13.315
— He'll surprise you, I think.
— We can hope.

49:14.369 --> 49:17.953
The Senate should ask my son to return.

49:18.832 --> 49:19.912
The time is ripe.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.407
Brutus return?

49:24.045 --> 49:26.001
No.

49:26.131 --> 49:29.965
Not yet. Not quite yet, Ithink.

49:30.093 --> 49:31.754
VVhen?

49:31.886 --> 49:34.878
We must wait and see how things develop.

49:35.014 --> 49:37.221
Wait and see?

49:40.019 --> 49:41.304
A noble strategy.

49:41.437 --> 49:44.395
Not noble, perhaps, but sensible.

49:44.524 --> 49:47.106
In any case, tell your son that I...

49:47.235 --> 49:50.227
No, not I...

49:52.073 --> 49:53.654
His friends in Rome

49:53.783 --> 49:56.240
look fonNard to seeing him again
