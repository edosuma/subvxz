00:01.000 --> 00:02.335
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.335 --> 00:05.504
I waited at school for an hour
and had to walk home.

00:05.504 --> 00:06.839
No one even called.

00:06.839 --> 00:08.007
Mandy went into labor.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.300
I had to go to the hospital.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.260
She had the baby
and no one told me?

00:11.260 --> 00:14.513
And what exactly is it
that's wrong with your bed?

00:14.513 --> 00:16.182
My husband's in it.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.225
So, you're just gonna
keep sleeping here

00:18.225 --> 00:19.852
instead of dealing
with it?

00:19.852 --> 00:21.854
I'm helping with the baby.

00:21.854 --> 00:24.899
She'll still be crying
tomorrow. Go home.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.336
Uh-oh.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.640
Ten dollars on pump two.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.058
You got it.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.106
Hi, uh, ten dollars
on pump, uh...

01:05.106 --> 01:06.274
whichever that one is.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.234
Ain't you young to be driving?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.195
Oh, I'm just pumping gas
for my dad.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.405
He's in the bathroom.
Might be a while.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.740
Been there.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.792
I'm on pump number three.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.876
You?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.045
Two.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.880
Nice.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.258
Hello?

01:32.258 --> 01:33.259
Hey, it's Missy.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.469
I stole my dad's truck,

01:34.469 --> 01:35.804
I'm running away.
Want to come?

01:35.804 --> 01:38.223
You're running away?
Sounds dangerous.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.724
Oh, um...

01:39.724 --> 01:41.059
well, my dad taught me
how to drive and...

01:41.059 --> 01:43.645
I'm messing with you.
Come and get me.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.648

is stronger than I am ♪

01:46.648 --> 01:49.234

02:11.297 --> 02:12.799
Why didn't we do this years ago?

02:12.799 --> 02:14.509
My feet wouldn't
reach the pedals.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.766
Dad, wake up. There's a problem.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.434
What? What's wrong?

02:23.434 --> 02:25.019
It's Saturday morning
and no one's cooking bacon.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.647
Oh. So go cook bacon.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.107
But Mom cooks bacon.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.608
Well, she's at
your meemaw's.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.277
Which is why I'm waking you up.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.612
Sheldon, you're a very
intelligent little boy,

02:34.612 --> 02:35.822
I'm sure you can handle bacon.

02:36.823 --> 02:37.907
I'll wake up Missy.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.742
No, wait...

02:39.742 --> 02:41.160
She's mad at the
world right now.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.704
Just leave her alone.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.455
Then I'll call Mom.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.791
Okay...

02:46.791 --> 02:49.127
I'll make your
stupid bacon, happy?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.336
I've been better.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.676
This is the best day of my life.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.344
First time running away?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.637
Pretty much.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.180
Think your parents
know you're gone?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.474
They barely know when I'm there.

03:03.474 --> 03:07.186
Missy, there's breakfast.
We saved you a little.

03:07.186 --> 03:08.813
What about somewhere
with a beach,

03:08.813 --> 03:10.023
like California?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.524
We've already driven
five hours east,

03:11.524 --> 03:13.192
so we might want to
keep heading that way.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.987
East. You really are smart.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.239
I get there was a lot
of yelling last night.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.744
Just want you to know I'm here
when you're ready to talk.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.078
I mean, if you want a beach,

03:24.078 --> 03:25.496
then Florida's in
the right direction.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.373
Oh, and it's almost
spring break.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.584
Like MTV Spring Break?
Mm-hmm.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.587
If you expect me to apologize,
you can sit in there forever.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.548
Great.
Then we're going to Florida.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.925
Let's pay and get out of here.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.509
Or...

03:38.509 --> 03:40.803
let's not pay
and get out of here.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.807
Fine, ignore me.
I'm eating your bacon.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.606
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.234
You know, there's a more
spatially efficient way

03:55.234 --> 03:57.528
to do that.
It's good enough.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.030
Is that what you tell
your football players?

03:59.030 --> 04:02.241
I make them run laps.
That what you want?

04:02.241 --> 04:05.203
You're funny.
I like our weekends together.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.916
Oh.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.168
Hi. Um...

04:12.168 --> 04:13.503
I didn't see your truck.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.088
I just came
to grab a few things.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.256
Yeah. It's fine.

04:17.256 --> 04:19.384
Hi, Shelly.
How you doing, baby?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.552
I'm all right, although
the dishwasher looks like

04:21.552 --> 04:23.262
it was loaded by Gustaf Dalén.

04:23.262 --> 04:26.474
He won a Nobel Prize in physics.
And was blind.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.435
What do you mean you didn't
see my truck outside?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.562
It's not out front.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.897
Yes, it is.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.607
I was just out there.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.904
The hell's my truck?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.908
It's a '86 Ford F-250.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.827
And you didn't hear anything?
No.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.578
What about you, ma'am?

04:47.578 --> 04:50.915
Well, um, actually...

04:50.915 --> 04:52.208
Oh, she hasn't
slept here in days.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.501
She's just
getting her things.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.086
I was taking
care of the baby.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.090
We have a new grandbaby.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.009
You mentioned you
had a daughter.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.135
Any chance she saw something?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.553
I doubt it.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.679
She didn't even
come out of her room.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.680
You haven't
seen her at all?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.140
No. She's mad at me.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.142
Mind if we ask her?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.269
Missy.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.478
Open up.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.109
Missy?

05:18.109 --> 05:19.360
Son of a bitch.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.362
Huh, your truck's gone
and she's gone?

05:21.362 --> 05:22.405
What are the odds of that?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.282
She took my truck, Sheldon.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.659
Oh, more chaos. Got it.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.871
We are breaking so
many laws right now.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.539
I feel like Thelma Louise.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.707
Me too.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.459
Have you seen
that movie?

05:34.459 --> 05:35.668
No.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.170
Me neither.

05:43.595 --> 05:45.797
How could you not know
she was missing?

05:45.797 --> 05:48.725
I thought she was giving me
the silent treatment.

05:48.725 --> 05:51.144
You know, teenage girls.

05:51.144 --> 05:52.225
I don't.

05:52.225 --> 05:54.043
Moody, moody, moody.

05:54.043 --> 05:56.003
Sheldon.
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

05:56.003 --> 05:58.148
Uh, well...

05:58.148 --> 06:00.330
Hard to say.
We just... Lot going on.

06:00.330 --> 06:01.915
Well, at 6:15 she made
a plate of food

06:01.915 --> 06:03.375
and took it to her room,

06:03.375 --> 06:04.751
which I said, "is how
you attract ants,"

06:04.751 --> 06:06.253
and she said to mind
my own business,

06:06.253 --> 06:07.838
and I said it
is my business

06:07.838 --> 06:09.131
because her bedroom
shares a wall with mine...

06:09.131 --> 06:11.341
6:15, got it.
No one saw her after that?

06:11.341 --> 06:13.135
Well, at 7:22, she had
to use the restroom,

06:13.135 --> 06:14.678
but she had to wait
because my dad was in there.

06:14.678 --> 06:15.762
Probably due
to all the beers.

06:15.762 --> 06:17.598
Thank you.
Happy to help.

06:17.598 --> 06:19.808
And then at 7:45, she
tried the bathroom again,

06:19.808 --> 06:21.435
and luckily, by then
my father had...

06:21.435 --> 06:23.520
Sheldon, when was
the last time you saw her?

06:23.520 --> 06:25.772
Well, at 9:15 I brought her
a can of Raid for the ants,

06:25.772 --> 06:27.816
and she told me to go to hell,
which is rude.

06:27.816 --> 06:29.776
And then at 11:06 I tried
to communicate with her

06:29.776 --> 06:31.528
via walkie-talkie
to no response.

06:31.528 --> 06:33.113
I can't believe
she would do this.

06:33.113 --> 06:35.157
How does she even
know how to drive?

06:36.116 --> 06:38.285
All right, now,
take your foot off the brake

06:38.285 --> 06:40.120
gently put it on the...

06:42.998 --> 06:44.583
I bet your mother taught her.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.252
She could be lost,
she could be in an accident,

06:47.252 --> 06:48.795
she could be in a ditch

06:48.795 --> 06:50.380
by the side of the road somewhere.

Nothing.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.863
Any word?

07:14.863 --> 07:17.032
No. None of her friends
have heard from her.

07:17.032 --> 07:19.034
The police are looking
for my truck, but still no sign.

07:19.034 --> 07:20.494
I can't believe
that girl.

07:20.494 --> 07:22.913
Did she even think about
how worried we'd all be?

07:22.913 --> 07:25.749
Wow, you became a dad fast.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.209
Well, it just kicks in.

07:27.209 --> 07:29.169
I don't know
who else to call.

07:29.169 --> 07:30.420
What about Paige?

07:30.420 --> 07:31.713
Are they still in touch?

07:31.713 --> 07:33.090
They saw each other
a few weeks ago.

07:33.090 --> 07:34.675
Although Paige was
quite inebriated.

07:34.675 --> 07:36.551
What?
It means drunk.

07:36.551 --> 07:38.011
We know what it means.

07:38.011 --> 07:39.554
And Paige has
run away from home before.

07:39.554 --> 07:40.681
If I was going on the lam,

07:40.681 --> 07:42.266
that's certainly
who I'd contact.

07:42.266 --> 07:44.184
"Lam." What a fun word.

07:44.184 --> 07:45.894
I'm glad I got the chance
to use it.

07:46.853 --> 07:48.188
Lam.
Hi. Linda,

07:48.188 --> 07:49.898
this is Mary Cooper.

07:49.898 --> 07:51.650
Um, I'm sorry
to call out of the blue,

07:51.650 --> 07:53.694
but is Missy there with Paige?

07:53.694 --> 07:55.862
No. Why?
What's going on?

07:55.862 --> 07:57.364
Well...

07:57.364 --> 07:59.408
Missy has run away,
and we thought...

07:59.408 --> 08:00.951
That my daughter
would have something

08:00.951 --> 08:03.704
to do with it?
Oh, no, I'm not accusing her.

08:03.704 --> 08:05.747
No, that's exactly
something she would do.

08:05.747 --> 08:06.748
Hold on.

08:06.748 --> 08:08.375
Paige.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.168
I'm thinking
she might be with Paige.

08:10.168 --> 08:11.628
Paige?

08:11.628 --> 08:12.796
Damn it.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.381
Hey, can I drive?

08:14.381 --> 08:16.216
Better not.

08:16.216 --> 08:18.552
My dad'll be pretty mad if
something happens to his truck.

08:18.552 --> 08:20.554
Like what,
if somebody stole it?

08:21.596 --> 08:22.889
Oh, my God, I'm a criminal.

08:22.889 --> 08:24.391
Yeah.
It's pretty cool, right?

08:24.391 --> 08:26.268
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

08:27.269 --> 08:28.395
Only if you go back.

08:29.396 --> 08:30.480
I guess you're right.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.190
I mean, don't worry.

08:32.190 --> 08:33.567
When we get to Daytona,
everything's gonna be great.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.776
Think so?

08:34.776 --> 08:36.737
Yeah.

08:37.654 --> 08:39.823
Hey, maybe we should
change our names.
Really?

08:39.823 --> 08:41.366
And I hate my name.

08:41.366 --> 08:43.660
Paige. What am I,
a congressional aide?

08:43.660 --> 08:46.330
Yeah, totally.

08:46.330 --> 08:47.914
So, what name
are you gonna pick?

08:47.914 --> 08:49.750
I'm thinking Ginger.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.293
That is so good.

08:51.293 --> 08:53.086
Ginger's not
a boring scientist.

08:53.086 --> 08:55.422
Ginger's fun.
She's alive.

08:55.422 --> 08:57.174
I'm gonna pick Susan.

08:57.174 --> 08:58.634
No, Suzie.
Much cuter.

08:58.634 --> 09:01.803
Ginger and Suzie.
Ginger and Suzie.

09:01.803 --> 09:03.597
♪ Call me up and tell me... ♪

09:03.597 --> 09:05.932
Wait, is it too late to
change my name to Brandi?

09:05.932 --> 09:08.352
Too late.
Come on, Ginger.

09:10.771 --> 09:13.440
I can't believe the last thing
we did was yell at her.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.775
Now, don't go blaming yourself.

09:14.775 --> 09:17.444
Uh, I was blaming both of us.

09:17.444 --> 09:19.529
So, we weren't
supposed to punish her?

09:19.529 --> 09:21.656
Kids do stupid stuff,
parents yell at them.

09:21.656 --> 09:24.368
Yeah, y'all did it to me,
I'm gonna do it to my kid.

09:24.368 --> 09:25.952
Calm down, Daddy.

09:25.952 --> 09:27.954
I know y'all are worried,
but this ain't helping.

09:27.954 --> 09:29.873
She snuck out
and stole my truck.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.625
I mean, how is this our fault?

09:31.625 --> 09:32.918
Well, maybe she was right.

09:32.918 --> 09:34.336
She does get ignored
around here.

09:34.336 --> 09:35.712
I liked being ignored.

09:35.712 --> 09:37.255
Let me get away with
all kinds of stuff.

09:37.255 --> 09:38.799
Please stop helping.

09:38.799 --> 09:40.634
We need to get the police
back on the phone.

09:40.634 --> 09:41.635
I know how to find them.

09:41.635 --> 09:43.470
Really?
How?

09:43.470 --> 09:45.263
Right, well, based on the time
they've been gone

09:45.263 --> 09:46.848
and the average speed limit,
I've calculated that this circle

09:46.848 --> 09:48.392
is the maximum distance
they could have traveled.

09:48.392 --> 09:51.061
And what are the pins?
I'm glad you asked.

09:51.061 --> 09:53.397
To help narrow down
the search, I've identified

09:53.397 --> 09:54.773
points of interest
to teenage girls.

09:54.773 --> 09:57.484
The big four--
malls, beauty salons,

09:57.484 --> 09:59.486
horse stables and roller rinks.

09:59.486 --> 10:01.196
And what are the blue pins?

10:01.196 --> 10:02.989
Those are places
that I'm interested in

10:02.989 --> 10:04.699
that we can swing by
after we find them.

10:04.699 --> 10:06.076
For example, Peaster, Texas...

10:06.076 --> 10:07.160
No one cares.

10:08.453 --> 10:10.455
Peaster, Texas--
birthplace of Robert E. Howard,

10:10.455 --> 10:13.667
regarded to be the father of
the sword and sorcery subgenre.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.210
Sheldon, this isn't about you.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.962
But it's a good start.

10:16.962 --> 10:18.672
Why don't you go
narrow that down even more?

10:18.672 --> 10:20.966
I'll check in Missy's room
for clues.

10:20.966 --> 10:23.427
If she took her roller skates,
this case is closed.

10:27.806 --> 10:29.349
Think your parents
are freaking out?

10:29.349 --> 10:31.143
Probably having a party.

10:31.143 --> 10:33.103
And then Sheldon will complain
about them having a party,

10:33.103 --> 10:35.564
and they'll stop because he gets
everything he wants.

10:36.690 --> 10:39.401
I know.
Try being the golden child.

10:39.401 --> 10:41.194
Everybody's always expecting
big things from you

10:41.194 --> 10:42.571
'cause you're a genius.

10:42.571 --> 10:44.448
What do you want to do?

10:45.449 --> 10:47.159
I don't know.

10:47.159 --> 10:49.077
Something simple, easy.

10:50.370 --> 10:52.372
You know, I heard there's
a place in Florida

10:52.372 --> 10:53.874
where you can get a job
as a mermaid.

10:53.874 --> 10:55.709
Really?
Really.

10:55.709 --> 10:58.545
Don't get mad at me,
but you are a genius.

10:58.545 --> 11:00.464
Just don't tell
the other mermaids.

11:01.548 --> 11:02.841
Oh, crap.

11:02.841 --> 11:04.509
Well, how fast are you going?

11:04.509 --> 11:05.594
I'm not going too fast.
Maybe I'm going too slow.

11:05.594 --> 11:06.803
Should I speed up?

11:06.803 --> 11:07.637
Don't speed up.
What are you doing?

11:07.637 --> 11:08.889
I don't know.

11:08.889 --> 11:10.307
Just...
Maybe it's not for us.

11:10.307 --> 11:11.683
Pull over and let him pass.

11:20.484 --> 11:21.693
What do we do?

11:21.693 --> 11:23.528
We need to get
our stories straight.

11:23.528 --> 11:26.239
We're cousins, you're 16,
you forgot your license at home,

11:26.239 --> 11:28.450
and we're on our way to the
hospital to visit our grandma.

11:28.450 --> 11:29.743
Okay.

11:34.873 --> 11:36.708
I'm only 13, I stole
my dad's truck

11:36.708 --> 11:38.168
and we didn't pay for
breakfast at the diner.

11:38.168 --> 11:39.294
We just left.

11:40.253 --> 11:42.672
Okay. And who's this?

11:42.672 --> 11:44.758
My cousin, Ginger.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.666
Is anyone hungry?
I can make sandwiches.

11:54.666 --> 11:55.709
No, thanks.

11:55.709 --> 11:57.544
Not hungry.
I could eat.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.838
Then make yourself a sandwich.

11:59.838 --> 12:01.465
Maybe you should.
Are you cranky?

12:01.465 --> 12:03.133
Okay, I figured it out.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.218
Based off the pictures

12:04.218 --> 12:05.594
she's ripped out of magazines,

12:05.594 --> 12:07.513
she's a big fan
of actor Luke Perry.

12:07.513 --> 12:10.808
Who is that?
He plays Dylan
on Beverly Hills, 90210.

12:10.808 --> 12:12.142
Your classic bad boy.

12:12.142 --> 12:14.186
Your classic bad boy?

12:14.186 --> 12:15.896
Yeah, like me.

12:15.896 --> 12:18.315
The show not only takes
place but is also filmed

12:18.315 --> 12:19.650
in Los Angeles, California.

12:19.650 --> 12:21.151
That's obviously
where she's heading.

12:24.321 --> 12:25.989
Cooper residence.

12:25.989 --> 12:27.366
Now, given the amount of time
since she's left...

12:27.366 --> 12:29.660
They're okay!
They've found them.

12:30.661 --> 12:31.662
Oh, thank God.

12:31.662 --> 12:32.996
Where are they?

12:32.996 --> 12:35.707
Uh, about an hour
east of Baton Rouge.

12:35.707 --> 12:37.042
Apparently they were
on their way to Florida.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.419
That's not where
Luke Perry is.

12:38.419 --> 12:39.503
Let me speak to them.

12:40.504 --> 12:41.713
Copy that.

12:42.673 --> 12:44.550
All right. Your parents
are on the way.

12:44.550 --> 12:46.218
Are they mad?

12:46.218 --> 12:48.929
If my daughter stole my car
and ran away, I'd be mad.

12:48.929 --> 12:51.181
What if she had a good reason?

12:52.224 --> 12:53.600
Do you have a good reason?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.686
Well, my brother's really smart

12:55.686 --> 12:58.355
and my older brother had a baby
and they were ignoring me.

12:58.355 --> 13:00.274
You might need
a better reason.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.193
Are you taking us to jail?

13:04.403 --> 13:05.404
No.

13:05.404 --> 13:07.364
Great, so we can go?

13:07.364 --> 13:09.116
No.

13:09.116 --> 13:11.076
But I'm not
taking you in either.

13:11.076 --> 13:12.703
Why not?

13:12.703 --> 13:15.873
I got a kid your age.
I get it.

13:16.874 --> 13:18.625
Oh, God,
I'd rather sit in jail

13:18.625 --> 13:20.752
than have another adult
tell me how much they get it.

13:20.752 --> 13:23.755
Not me.
Happy right here.

13:25.883 --> 13:28.802
I'm real sorry for whatever
Paige got Missy into.

13:28.802 --> 13:31.930
Thanks, but I think
this one's on Missy.

13:31.930 --> 13:34.558
I doubt it. Last month
she swiped my credit card

13:34.558 --> 13:36.393
and bought a plane ticket
to Hawaii.

13:36.393 --> 13:37.728
Nonrefundable.

13:37.728 --> 13:39.229
What did you do?

13:39.229 --> 13:40.355
What could I do?
I dropped her off at her dad's

13:40.355 --> 13:42.274
and I went to Hawaii.

13:42.274 --> 13:43.901
Trust me,

13:43.901 --> 13:45.319
Missy's never gonna do
anything like this again.

13:45.319 --> 13:47.738
Aw, bless your heart.

13:47.738 --> 13:51.325
I'm serious.
School and home, that's it.

13:51.325 --> 13:54.745
No TV, no friends, no shoes.

13:54.745 --> 13:56.330
Let's see her
run away barefoot.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.791
That's your plan--
make her hate us even more?

13:59.791 --> 14:01.126
I'm not trying
to be her friend, Mary.

14:01.126 --> 14:02.419
I'm trying to be her parent.

14:02.419 --> 14:04.296
What do you think
I'm trying to be?

14:04.296 --> 14:06.340
Oh, I don't know.
Her neighbor?

14:09.635 --> 14:11.470
Is everything okay?

14:11.470 --> 14:13.263
Yes.

14:13.263 --> 14:15.474
I've just been staying
across the street

14:15.474 --> 14:17.226
taking care of
our granddaughter.

14:17.226 --> 14:19.102
How long you gonna
keep using that excuse?

14:19.102 --> 14:21.813
I am so sorry.
It's been a stressful week.

14:21.813 --> 14:24.483
You don't need to apologize.
I've been there.

14:24.483 --> 14:25.651
Right.

14:26.610 --> 14:29.446
I know it's not
my place, but...

14:29.446 --> 14:31.823
Barry and I used to keep
a bunch of stuff bottled up,

14:31.823 --> 14:34.159
and we know how that turned out.

14:34.159 --> 14:36.203
We're not getting divorced.

14:36.203 --> 14:37.663
Yeah, over my dead body.

14:37.663 --> 14:39.831
Yeah, that's exactly
how it's gonna end.

14:40.791 --> 14:42.459
Oh, boy.

14:46.338 --> 14:48.799
What was Missy thinking?
Why Florida?

14:48.799 --> 14:50.300
Why does it matter?

14:50.300 --> 14:51.969
I made a solid hypothesis
backed by data.

14:51.969 --> 14:53.178
Where did I go wrong?

14:53.178 --> 14:55.222
You tried to predict
a teenage girl.

14:57.391 --> 14:58.684
Perhaps when she gets back

14:58.684 --> 15:00.143
we can take her in
for a brain scan.

15:00.143 --> 15:02.145
Maybe what Missy needs

15:02.145 --> 15:04.565
is for us all to be
a little understanding.

15:04.565 --> 15:05.899
I'm trying to understand.

15:05.899 --> 15:07.442
That's why I need
the brain scan.

15:07.442 --> 15:10.237
Look, your sister's
going through a lot these days.

15:10.237 --> 15:11.822
She's feeling overlooked,

15:11.822 --> 15:14.032
confused, angry, sad.

15:14.992 --> 15:16.660
She's feeling all those
things at once?

15:17.661 --> 15:18.704
Yeah.

15:18.704 --> 15:20.247
And I can't scan her brain?

15:20.247 --> 15:22.332
That is so unfair.

15:22.332 --> 15:24.710
So, what exactly
was your plan?

15:24.710 --> 15:26.670
We were gonna
go to Daytona Beach.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.005
Like on MTV.

15:28.005 --> 15:29.381
And what were you
gonna do for money?

15:29.381 --> 15:31.133
I don't know.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.843
We would have figured
something out.

15:32.843 --> 15:35.053
Yeah, she's an actual genius.

15:36.013 --> 15:37.347
Sorry.

15:37.347 --> 15:40.267
Don't get a lot of
geniuses back there.

15:40.267 --> 15:42.561
Mostly stupid folk.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.565
I'm just saying, I have a good
relationship with Missy.

15:46.565 --> 15:49.026
Yeah, I taught her
how to throw a ball.

15:49.026 --> 15:50.444
Taught her how to drive.

15:50.444 --> 15:52.195
You taught her how to drive?

15:52.195 --> 15:54.197
Oh, uh...

15:54.197 --> 15:56.199
You know, just the basics
in-in a parking lot.

15:57.743 --> 15:59.036
Hey...

15:59.036 --> 16:00.370
She made it all the
way to Louisiana

16:00.370 --> 16:01.580
without getting
into an accident.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.373
I think I did a
pretty good job.

16:03.373 --> 16:04.875
Unbelievable.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.585
If y'all want, I can recommend

16:06.585 --> 16:08.712
the marriage counselor
me and Barry used.

16:10.172 --> 16:12.215
What's...

16:12.215 --> 16:14.551
Y'all got divorced.

16:14.551 --> 16:15.969
How good can he be?

16:15.969 --> 16:17.596
Well, she...

16:17.596 --> 16:19.890
Stop with the...

16:19.890 --> 16:23.560
Oh, like she's not
gonna be on your side?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.312
It's not about sides.

16:25.312 --> 16:27.314
She helped us realize we were
staying in our marriage

16:27.314 --> 16:28.857
for the wrong reasons

16:28.857 --> 16:30.609
and it would be better
for everyone if we split.

16:30.609 --> 16:32.986
I'm not sure
it was better for Paige.

16:34.821 --> 16:37.658
Paige's issues have nothing
to do with our divorce.

16:37.658 --> 16:39.034
Sure.

16:41.036 --> 16:43.789
How much she have to pay the
counselor to tell her that?

16:46.333 --> 16:48.168
At least my daughter
didn't steal my truck,

16:48.168 --> 16:51.004
and none of my kids
are having babies.

16:52.089 --> 16:54.091
Okay, we all have our stuff.

16:55.842 --> 16:57.094
Here comes another one.

16:58.804 --> 17:01.556
Fifty-eight.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.225
How does it know?

17:03.225 --> 17:05.227
It calculates the speed
based on the Doppler shift

17:05.227 --> 17:07.145
of the reflected radio waves.

17:07.145 --> 17:09.439
See? Genius.

17:09.439 --> 17:11.942
My brother's like that too,
but she's way more fun.

17:14.945 --> 17:16.530
Ninety-one.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.365
All right, buckle up.

17:18.365 --> 17:19.658
Yes!

17:22.244 --> 17:24.172
Show me how to use your gun
and I'll cover you.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.588
If you need a break,
I can drive for a bit.

17:38.588 --> 17:40.338
I'm okay, thanks.

17:40.338 --> 17:43.175
I could take a turn.
Not a time for jokes.

17:43.175 --> 17:44.968
You may never drive again.

17:44.968 --> 17:47.471
And you are not hanging out
with Paige anymore.

17:47.471 --> 17:49.473
That's not fair.
It was my idea, not Paige's.

17:49.473 --> 17:51.641
You really think
that's helping your case?

17:51.641 --> 17:54.311
Liked it better
when you two weren't talking.

17:54.311 --> 17:56.563
Well, too bad, 'cause we are.

17:56.563 --> 17:58.482
If you're feeling
ignored, don't worry.

17:58.482 --> 18:00.776
We're gonna be laser-focused
on you from now on.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.779
This marked the beginning of

18:03.779 --> 18:05.197
what our family
would come to call

18:05.197 --> 18:07.491
"Missy's difficult period."

18:07.491 --> 18:08.658
Despite my repeated assurances

18:08.658 --> 18:10.243
that I could solve the problem

18:10.243 --> 18:11.912
with a brain scan
and some low-voltage

18:11.912 --> 18:13.663
electric shocks, I was

18:13.663 --> 18:16.666
never given the opportunity.
Such a shame.
