WEBVTT

00:28.570 --> 00:29.988
Thing gave me your note.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.782
I was surprised you wanted to see me again

00:32.866 --> 00:34.826
after you ran out the other night.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.580
So, uh, is this a date?

00:38.663 --> 00:39.956
It's a surprise.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.302
When I came to Nevermore,
romance was the last thing on my mind.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.097
But when you kissed me,

00:57.098 --> 01:00.101
you opened my eyes
and suddenly it all made sense.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.106
Xavier warned me about you,
but I didn't listen.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.108
Ironic now, huh?

01:07.192 --> 01:09.235
Ironic would've been
framing Xavier for murder

01:09.319 --> 01:11.154
while the real Hyde
helped me put him away.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.451
Wait… you don't think--

01:16.534 --> 01:18.244
I don't think. I know.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.372
Kinbott probably discovered your secret
during one of your sessions.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.499
So she unlocked you.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.792
Why'd you kill her?

01:24.459 --> 01:26.878
I thought Hydes
were typically loyal to their masters.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.379
Wednesday, this is nuts.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.966
On Outreach Day, I told you
I was visiting the old meeting house.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.511
Did Kinbott send you to spy on me?

01:35.678 --> 01:36.513
At the Rave'N,

01:36.596 --> 01:39.140
<i>you overheard Eugene and me</i>
<i>discussing your cave in the woods</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:40.225
<i>and you warned Kinbott.</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:42.602
Eugene probably saw her torching it.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.231
Then she sent you to clean up her mess.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.150
I have to hand it to you, Tyler.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.986
Wounding yourself that night
at the Gates mansion,

01:52.821 --> 01:54.781
that was a masterstroke of misdirection.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.158
Okay, stop. Do you know
how insane you sound right now?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.202
I'm not a monster.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.995
A… And if you really thought that I was,

02:01.079 --> 02:04.040
why would you risk bringing me
out to the woods to confront me alone?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.667
Who said I was alone?

02:14.050 --> 02:18.096
Okay, I don't know what kind of sick joke
you're playing, but I'm out of here.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.013
Actually…

02:21.015 --> 02:22.559
you're coming with us.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.748
Welcome back.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.376
Where the hell am I?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.503
Somewhere no one can hear your screams.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.754
What's with the chains?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.381
Don't ask stupid questions.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.926
Wednesday, this is crazy. I'm a normie.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.428
That's only half true.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.140
Do you recognize her?

03:02.223 --> 03:05.393
Perhaps if I hadn't been so distracted
by my own mother hogging this photo,

03:05.476 --> 03:07.395
I would have noticed yours sooner.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.899
Your father fell in love
and married an outcast.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.820
My mom was an outcast.
That doesn't make me a monster.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.739
According to her
personal medical records--

03:17.822 --> 03:20.617
-You stole her medical records?
-Technically, Thing did.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.912
He took them from your garage.
Your father's quite the pack rat.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.582
Her postpartum depression
triggered her condition.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.542
My mom had severe bipolar disorder.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.002
We both know that's a lie.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.045
She was a Hyde.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.797
And your father has been
living his life in dread,

03:34.881 --> 03:37.675
never quite sure whether or not
she passed her condition on to you.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.804
Are you all gonna stand there
and let her do this to me?

03:41.888 --> 03:44.140
Uh, guys? Enid just texted.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.808
Thornhill's suspicious.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.561
How long until he morphs into that… thing?

03:48.645 --> 03:49.812
I'm not the monster.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.440
You are. I saw it
in a vision at the Weathervane.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.819
Wait, you're basing all this off
some vision you had after we kissed?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.738
I mean, is that something you can trust?

03:59.447 --> 04:00.949
Wednesday, what are you doing?

04:01.616 --> 04:04.535
Just some light torture.
Don't worry, I won't leave a mark.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.872
-Wednesday, hold on.
-Wait. Are you being serious?

04:08.539 --> 04:10.625
There's only one thing
that a Hyde understands.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.252
Pain.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.878
-Wait! No, Wednesday!
-Wednesday!

04:15.213 --> 04:16.381
That's it. I'm out!

04:17.340 --> 04:19.050
-Us too.
-No.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.134
-Wait.
-No, I'm done.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.513
Wednesday, I didn't sign up for this.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.557
-Let's go to Weems, explain everything.
-Weems won't help.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.060
And Tyler is always
one step ahead of his father.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.313
Then you're on your own.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.193
No, don't leave me here with her, please!
I'm begging you, please!

05:53.353 --> 05:57.190
<i>When I press him on his mother</i>
<i>or any sensitive issue, he snaps,</i>

05:57.273 --> 05:59.233
<i>becoming cold and detached.</i>

05:59.317 --> 06:01.486
<i>It's like I'm talking</i>
<i>to a different person.</i>

06:02.236 --> 06:03.946
<i>I'm increasingly concerned.</i>

06:04.030 --> 06:06.115
<i>I believe the trauma of losing his mother</i>

06:06.199 --> 06:09.202
<i>may have left Tyler with deeper</i>
<i>psychological scars than I suspected.</i>

06:19.045 --> 06:21.130
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Sheriff Galpin.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.383
We have a problem.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.053
And her name is Wednesday Addams.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.306
What is Kinbott, or should I say
Laurel Gates, using you for?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.849
Wednesday, please.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.936
Tyler, the body parts
in the basement of the Gates mansion,

06:35.019 --> 06:36.437
what was she collecting them for?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.564
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.281
Let's test your reflexes.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.700
-I'm in here!
-Get away from my son! Drop it.

06:51.035 --> 06:51.953
Drop it.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.252
Sign here.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.929
Sheriff Galpin isn't
pressing kidnapping charges.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.390
Which is a miracle
given the circumstances.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.349
Of course not.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.560
How long have you known?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.353
Excuse me?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.606
When I gave you that claw from the cave,
did you already know?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.358
Wednesday, that's enough.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.569
Xavier Thorpe is our Hyde.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.405
We've got evidence, thanks to you.
That's why I'm giving you one pass.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.282
Tyler is going to turn on you too.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.450
Let's go.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.208
Get out.

07:40.751 --> 07:41.919
We… Wednesday, wait.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.965
Tyler! No, no, what are you doing?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.134
I need to talk to her, Dad.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.470
She was my friend.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.139
We're in a police station.
What's gonna happen?

07:59.979 --> 08:00.813
Make it quick.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.155
What do you want?

08:10.781 --> 08:12.033
To ask a question.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.996
What does it feel like?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.582
What does what feel like?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.251
To lose.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.299
You know, at first,

08:28.382 --> 08:29.800
I'd wake up naked,

08:30.343 --> 08:31.636
covered in blood,

08:32.512 --> 08:34.222
no idea what happened.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.099
But over time,

08:38.267 --> 08:39.685
I started to remember

08:40.603 --> 08:41.562
everything.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.274
The sound of their screams,

08:46.108 --> 08:48.152
the panic in their eyes,

08:49.195 --> 08:52.823
and a fear so primal I could taste it.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.288
And it was delicious.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.920
You have no idea what's coming.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.997
The quid pro quo
for Sheriff Galpin not pressing charges

09:41.080 --> 09:43.583
is your immediate expulsion
from Nevermore.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.294
The others had nothing to do with this.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.087
I acted alone.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.466
For someone who claims to have no friends,
you certainly protect them.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.552
They didn't have guts
to do what needed to be done.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.555
You mean kidnapping and torture?
I should hope not.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.850
You do realize that Tyler
brutally disemboweled six people,

10:00.933 --> 10:02.977
then harvested a variety
of their body parts.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.187
Perhaps if you'd come to me
with your suspicions

10:05.271 --> 10:07.106
rather than take matters
into your own hands,

10:07.189 --> 10:08.566
we could've worked together.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.194
Because trust and cooperation have always
been hallmarks of our relationship.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.451
I admire your ability
to be your own person

10:18.534 --> 10:20.328
and trust your own instincts.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.539
But that also makes you
impatient and impulsive.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.792
Your actions have put me
and the school in an impossible position.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.294
Tyler is the Hyde.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.465
And he has framed Xavier.
He confessed everything to me!

10:32.548 --> 10:34.800
I wish I could believe you.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.805
His mother was an outcast.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.308
She was a student here,
you must remember her.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.643
She was a Hyde!

10:43.726 --> 10:45.519
Yes, Francois. A lovely woman.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.438
I didn't ask what she identified as.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.441
Then give me more time,
and I can prove they are Hydes.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.776
There is no more time,

10:51.859 --> 10:53.986
and there are no more deals, Wednesday.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.697
Pack your steamer trunks.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.199
We will have them shipped.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.742
And say your goodbyes.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.037
You'll be on the afternoon train tomorrow.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.875
I'm sorry Nevermore
didn't work out for you, Wednesday.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.545
I'm sure your mother
will be very disappointed.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.176
And so am I.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.479
Xavier… I'm not sure
how much time we have.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.107
Thing distracted the guards
and is looping the cameras.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.484
What are you doing here?

11:34.485 --> 11:35.986
I know you're not the Hyde.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.657
Tyler used me to frame you.
He is the actual Hyde.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.411
How do you know?

11:45.121 --> 11:47.164
I saw it in a vision when he kissed me.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.421
I'm… glad you were getting some action
while I was falsely accused.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.131
I should've believed you.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.883
But since you seem to have
some psychic connection to the Hyde,

11:57.967 --> 11:59.844
I was curious if you've drawn anything

11:59.927 --> 12:02.221
-that might shed light on this?
-You want my help?

12:07.476 --> 12:09.103
You ruined my life!

12:13.899 --> 12:14.775
No.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.902
I tried being your friend.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.614
-Look where that got me.
-This isn't about us, Xavier.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.699
No, it's about you!

12:22.283 --> 12:24.660
Every time you get involved,
people get hurt.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.871
You're toxic.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.708
All you ever do is make things worse.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.508
Tyler warned me something bad
was coming. I think--

12:39.592 --> 12:40.468
I don't care!

12:40.551 --> 12:43.012
Do you want to stop this? Then leave.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.431
Go far away and never come back.

12:47.516 --> 12:48.434
Do you understand?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.687
That can't happen if you're not here.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.524
That's how you save everyone, okay?

12:56.984 --> 12:57.818
So, go.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.989
Leave!

13:34.647 --> 13:38.776
I can't believe I'm actually going to miss
your creepy, lifeless eyes waking me up.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.528
It won't be the same without you.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.574
So I assume you'll be moving in with Yoko.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.243
Leaving me in the past.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.410
Not ever.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.329
What about you?

13:51.497 --> 13:52.665
Will you forget about me?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.545
Enid… the mark
you have left on me is indelible.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.506
Anytime I grow nauseous
at the sight of a rainbow

14:00.589 --> 14:02.842
or hear a pop song
that makes my ears bleed,

14:03.342 --> 14:04.677
I'll think of you.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.097
Thanks.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.182
I guess.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.855
I always believed relying on other people
to be a sign of weakness.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.109
That inevitably they would
lead me to disappointment.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.488
Turns out I've been the disappointment.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.282
Are you kidding me?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.493
I've learned so much from you.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.954
Part of it is admittedly
criminal behavior,

14:32.037 --> 14:35.958
but… most people spend their entire lives
pretending to give zero effs,

14:36.041 --> 14:38.419
and you literally
never had an eff to give.

14:40.504 --> 14:44.008
Any chance you've got
some sort of sneaky plan to elude Weems?

14:45.175 --> 14:46.260
Xavier's right.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.889
This prophecy cannot
come true if I'm not here.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.351
But it kills me to leave
when Tyler is still walking around free.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.980
If he tries anything,

14:58.063 --> 15:01.317
we have a school full of gorgons,
vampires, and werewolves,

15:01.400 --> 15:02.568
ready and waiting.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.820
We've got this, Wednesday. I promise.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.407
On a good note,

15:08.490 --> 15:10.159
I got a text from Eugene's moms.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.619
He woke up last night.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.954
Maybe Weems'll let you drop by
on your way to the station.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.879
I think we're all set.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.006
Thing,

15:24.590 --> 15:26.550
I'm going to miss our makeup tutorials.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.969
And you better keep sending me
moisturizing tips.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.888
Stay in touch, okay?

15:42.942 --> 15:43.943
So, we're gonna…

15:47.363 --> 15:48.322
You're right.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.658
Not hugging is kind of our thing.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.088
The plan wasn't to get you expelled.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.965
We're sorry.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.926
The Nightshades need to be ready
for what's coming.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.844
Or a lot of people are going to die.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.641
I'm so glad I caught you.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.645
I was weeding my wolfsbane,
and I just completely lost track of time.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.730
This is a parting gift.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.527
White oleander, one of nature's deadliest.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.738
It also symbolizes destiny and renewal.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.408
You're a very talented young woman,
Wednesday.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.952
I can't wait to see what you do next.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.204
Wednesday.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.666
This time I'm personally
escorting you to your train.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.085
I have one final favor.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.393
Wednesday!

17:00.269 --> 17:01.228
Eugene.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.189
Glad to see you're finally awake.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.734
-I heard you visited all the time.
-Don't ever mention it again.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.403
-Listen, I've been meaning to tell you…

17:11.321 --> 17:14.575
I shouldn't have gone to the dance.
I should have been with you.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.369
When the dance floor calls,
you gotta answer.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.958
-It's not your fault. It's the monster's.
-It's actually called a Hyde.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.753
It's still out there.
You can't go back to Nevermore.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.129
Not even to check on your bees.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.923
And you have to listen to me this time.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.468
I thought hummers were
supposed to stick together.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.222
That night in the woods,

17:37.973 --> 17:39.641
someone set fire to that cave.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.685
Yes, Dr. Kinbott.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.812
It's so crazy that it was her.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.315
I don't really remember any of it.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.693
I just saw someone wearing black
and those boots.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.195
What about her boots?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.281
There was an explosion of light

17:54.364 --> 17:56.492
and just for a moment,

17:56.575 --> 17:58.160
I saw that they weren't black.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.037
They were red.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.058
Wednesday.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.977
I thought you'd be
halfway to New Jersey by now.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.771
You can drop the act, Laurel.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.107
I should have known it was you.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.316
Faking your death,

18:29.399 --> 18:31.276
securing a job at Nevermore,

18:31.360 --> 18:32.820
unlocking a Hyde.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.614
Typically, I have great admiration
for well-executed revenge plots.

18:35.697 --> 18:39.118
But yours was a bit extreme,
even for my high standards.

18:39.868 --> 18:40.869
Oh, dear.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.122
Weems was right.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.000
You do need psychiatric help.

18:47.584 --> 18:51.255
Can't throw out wild accusations
without consequences.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.466
They may be wild… but they're true.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.593
Tyler told me everything.

19:03.976 --> 19:08.021
Initially I incorrectly accused Kinbott
of using hypnosis to unlock him.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.607
But you used
a plant-derived chemical, didn't you?

19:12.109 --> 19:14.778
I know your father kept tabs
on all the outcasts in town.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.365
So I assume he told you about the Galpin
family secret when you were just a girl.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.242
<i>That's why you targeted Tyler.</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:23.662
<i>You manipulated him</i>
<i>by showing him what his mother truly was.</i>

19:24.371 --> 19:26.665
What Tyler didn't realize
is that truth wouldn't free him.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.709
I'm so sorry.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.045
<i>It would enslave him to you.</i>

19:32.629 --> 19:35.424
That was scary at first,
so you used the cave and the shackles.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.304
<i>But eventually he willingly</i>
<i>became your servant.</i>

19:40.387 --> 19:42.681
And when Kinbott came close
to discovering the truth,

19:42.764 --> 19:44.933
you had Tyler kill her
and pin it on Xavier.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.562
Ugh. That's enough.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.317
Tyler, honey,
make Mama happy and shut her up.

19:54.067 --> 19:54.985
Permanently.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.486
He's not on your side.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.239
Tyler will do anything for me.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.285
Remember what I told you?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.996
I showed you who you really are.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.459
What they did to your mother…

20:12.211 --> 20:14.755
The outcasts made you a monster.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.927
If you only hate outcasts,
why is he killing normies as well?

20:21.511 --> 20:23.347
They're just pawns in a bigger game.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.016
Just like you, Wednesday.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.561
Once again,
you've underestimated the situation.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.939
You were never getting on that train.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.024
I sent Tyler to intercept you.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.568
I never made it to the station.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.445
Heard enough?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.955
Your slave is probably
still at the station.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.625
Don't make this more difficult
than it already is, Marilyn.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.586
My name is Laurel!

21:06.223 --> 21:09.184
Principal Weems!
Principal Weems!

21:21.863 --> 21:23.282
Nightshade poisoning.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.992
A fitting end, don't you think?

21:48.515 --> 21:49.516
Whoa.

21:50.934 --> 21:51.935
Are you okay?

21:52.477 --> 21:55.188
You're not gonna, like,
wolf out on me, are you?

21:55.272 --> 21:57.107
It is a full blood moon.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.401
I'm okay, I think.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.904
But this is helping.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.170
Hey! Eugene, how are you?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.421
<i>Have you seen Wednesday?</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:22.632
No, she left this afternoon.
Didn't she swing by to see you?

22:22.716 --> 22:25.761
Listen, Principal Weems and her
went and confronted Ms. Thornhill.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.804
But I haven't heard a peep
from either of them.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.598
Why would they confront Ms. Thornhill?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.850
<i>Because she's behind</i>
<i>everything that's happened.</i>

22:31.933 --> 22:33.894
<i>She's the bad guy… bad woman.</i>

22:33.977 --> 22:35.395
<i>She's just a really bad person.</i>

22:35.479 --> 22:38.190
Okay. Ajax and I will go
check out the conservatory.

22:38.774 --> 22:42.694
<i>-Yo. Bee boy, welcome back.</i>
What's he doing in your room?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.237
-Um…

22:45.864 --> 22:46.865
Wha…?

22:50.827 --> 22:52.579
Slow down! What happened?

22:56.750 --> 22:57.834
Principal Weems?

22:57.918 --> 23:00.212
-What the hell is going on?
-What about Wednesday?

23:00.921 --> 23:02.297
Tyler and Thornhill took her?

23:03.090 --> 23:04.257
Where?

23:05.008 --> 23:06.426
Crackstone's crypt, what the heck?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.222
Who are the Nightshades?

23:13.308 --> 23:14.935
I'll… I'll explain on the way.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.062
Come on.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.481
<i>Guys. Guys?</i>

23:20.565 --> 23:21.983
Calm down, Eugene.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.111
That gorgon is a moron.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.655
It… It could be dangerous.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.199
If Enid's right,
and Wednesday's been taken,

23:29.282 --> 23:31.701
-we need to call the sheriff.
-Mom, I've got to go.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.455
Wednesday's my only friend,
and if she's in trouble, I've got to help.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.623
It's hive code.

24:16.329 --> 24:19.207
Kind of a déjà vu thing
we got going on, huh?

24:20.083 --> 24:22.627
Except I won't cry and whine like a child.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.297
Tyler, go wait by the boat.

24:26.047 --> 24:26.923
Yes.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.010
Listen to your master
and be a good little Hyde.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.269
-I have to admit…

24:39.352 --> 24:42.272
…that shape-shifting stunt
with Weems almost worked.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.192
But as my father always said,

24:45.775 --> 24:48.945
"If you want to outsmart an outcast,
you got to out-think 'em."

24:50.947 --> 24:54.701
You know, we have roots that go
all the way back to Joseph Crackstone.

24:54.784 --> 24:57.037
So you come from a line
of psychotic killers too.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.123
Joseph Crackstone was a visionary,

25:00.207 --> 25:02.792
dedicated to protecting
normies from outcasts

25:02.876 --> 25:04.669
until his life was cut short

25:04.753 --> 25:07.380
by your ancestor, Goody Addams.

25:07.964 --> 25:10.008
And then, to add insult to injury,

25:10.091 --> 25:13.178
they stole his land to build
that abomination of a school.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.060
But,

25:21.478 --> 25:23.021
throughout the centuries,

25:23.104 --> 25:26.816
my family has remained
committed to Crackstone's mission.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.486
My brother died serving that cause.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.364
I decided to take a different approach.

25:32.864 --> 25:33.990
The supernatural.

25:34.991 --> 25:38.370
Tyler's been collecting these body parts
to resurrect Crackstone.

25:38.453 --> 25:42.624
The one man who nearly succeeded
in eradicating the outcasts.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.043
You can't wake the dead.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.670
Believe me, I've tried.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.341
I believe your ancestor Goody Addams
would disagree.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.176
Goody's Book of Shadows.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.929
You're the one that stole
the original from Pilgrim World.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.558
It wasn't enough for Goody
to kill Crackstone.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.726
She had to curse his soul too.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.938
What does this have to do with me?

26:06.106 --> 26:07.399
My dear Wednesday,

26:08.191 --> 26:09.776
you are the key.

26:09.859 --> 26:13.488
Your arrival at Nevermore set
the chubby wheels of my plan in motion.

26:13.989 --> 26:18.076
Goody sealed Crackstone
in his sarcophagus with a blood lock.

26:18.159 --> 26:21.079
Only one of her direct descendants
can open it.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.039
You are the key.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.293
A living descendant
on the night of a blood moon.

26:26.835 --> 26:30.130
So… I bided my time,

26:30.213 --> 26:32.215
and I made you feel special

26:32.716 --> 26:34.843
until you were ready to be sacrificed.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.514
Damn it.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.473
Quiet!

26:41.725 --> 26:43.059
Santiago, what's up?

26:43.143 --> 26:44.728
Sir, we got a situation.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.314
Eugene Ottinger's mom
just called, frantic.

26:47.397 --> 26:51.067
-Something's going on at Nevermore.
-Get a couple cars over there ASAP.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.819
<i>That's just it, I can't.</i>

26:52.902 --> 26:56.031
The tires on the squad cars
have been slashed. Every damn one.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.116
All right, I'm on my way.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.075
I am of your blood.

29:04.159 --> 29:09.247
I have summoned you to rid the world
of outcasts once and for all.

29:15.378 --> 29:18.673
My vengeance will be swift and true.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.509
As will mine.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.722
Goody Addams.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.600
You haunt me still.

29:28.683 --> 29:31.728
You will suffer the same fate
you bequeathed me.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.775
Now burn in the eternal fires of hell.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.987
Where you belong.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.960
Sweet dreams, Wednesday!

30:04.594 --> 30:07.931
I can't believe you're in a secret society
and you didn't tell me.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.017
Because, you know,

30:12.310 --> 30:13.394
it's secret.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.856
Bianca, Davina…

30:17.649 --> 30:18.983
and Kent?

30:19.067 --> 30:21.110
Seriously, even Kent is here?

30:21.194 --> 30:23.446
How exclusive is this club?

30:23.530 --> 30:25.907
So, what's the deal
with Thornhill being a psycho?

30:25.990 --> 30:29.035
She murdered Weems and then took
Wednesday to Crackstone's crypt.

30:29.702 --> 30:32.789
We have to get everyone in the school
to safety before it's too late.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.123
This is what's coming.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.376
So do we pull the fire alarms?

30:36.459 --> 30:39.087
We don't want to cause a panic
and alert Tyler or Thornhill.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.548
So how do we get everyone out?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.759
We'll use our siren song to convince them.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.810
Thing and I will go look for Wednesday.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.646
Okay, Nightshades forever.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.734
Seriously, a secret snap too?

31:10.785 --> 31:12.036
Wednesday.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.500
Are you here to take me to the other side?

31:17.584 --> 31:21.004
Listen, Crackstone must be stabbed
through his black heart.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.632
It is the only way
he will be vanquished now and forever.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.510
Is your spectral vision impaired?
I'm dying.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.429
Your necklace.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.847
It is a powerful talisman.

31:32.515 --> 31:35.018
My mother told me
it's for conjuring visions.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.395
It is also a conduit
for conjuring spirits.

31:37.478 --> 31:40.690
It will allow me
to pass through you and heal you.

31:40.773 --> 31:43.902
Just know, once I do,
you will never see me again.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.613
The school needs you, Wednesday.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.918
Why're we stopping
in the middle of the woods?

32:42.001 --> 32:44.796
-You tracking your little monster?
-You shut it.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.134
Hey, wait. Wait!

32:50.802 --> 32:52.387
Hey! What about me?

32:52.470 --> 32:53.471
What…

32:54.555 --> 32:56.099
Oh, you asshole!

32:57.141 --> 32:59.602
Come on, let's move quickly
and calmly, all right?

32:59.686 --> 33:02.063
-Good job! Let's keep moving.
-Bianca!

33:04.399 --> 33:05.566
What the hell's going on?

33:06.150 --> 33:08.820
Danger is on its way.
No time to delay.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.577
Follow me. Come on, faster.

33:32.593 --> 33:33.636
Oh my God.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.805
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

33:36.305 --> 33:37.765
It's happening!

33:40.143 --> 33:41.519
Thing, I'm wolfing out!

33:55.616 --> 33:57.201
Laurel said you were dead.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.162
I'm feeling much better now.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.039
You're like a cockroach.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.291
Please, flattery will get you nowhere.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.504
This will not end well for you.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.539
Enid?

34:45.083 --> 34:45.917
Enid!

34:54.175 --> 34:55.927
I need to get back to the school.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.268
I can't tell you
how I've longed for this moment,

35:04.352 --> 35:05.770
what it means for my family.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.271
Silence, woman!

35:08.231 --> 35:13.069
Be gone, or I will cut thy tongue
from thy wretched mouth!

35:15.071 --> 35:16.197
Never meet your heroes.

35:27.875 --> 35:31.337
I will expunge
you abominations from this Earth!

35:51.107 --> 35:52.483
Yes!

35:52.567 --> 35:53.651
Yes!

35:53.734 --> 35:55.153
Yes, Thing!

36:23.848 --> 36:24.807
Tyler.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.434
Son, is that really you?

37:36.462 --> 37:37.838
Howdy, pilgrim.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.427
How canst thy heart still beat?

37:44.011 --> 37:46.722
What demon sorcery is this?

37:46.806 --> 37:48.057
Stay away from her!

38:01.070 --> 38:01.904
No!

38:04.782 --> 38:07.827
-Oh my God!
-I'm fine. Go. Get them out of here!

38:09.161 --> 38:10.538
Now!

38:10.621 --> 38:11.455
Okay!

38:15.668 --> 38:17.503
Come on, guys. Let's go! Go! Go!

38:59.378 --> 39:01.922
I will send you back to hell.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.830
You brought a gun to a sword fight.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.999
It's probably the first smart decision
you've made today.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.836
I might not get to kill all the outcasts,

40:21.919 --> 40:24.338
but at least I'll get to kill you,
Wednesday.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.119
Yeah, that's what you get
for messing with Nevermore.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.454
Bitch.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.625
Hummers stick together, right?

41:12.386 --> 41:13.888
I'll take it from here.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.639
Maybe we should call the sheriff?

41:15.723 --> 41:16.724
Turn around, Eugene.

41:38.370 --> 41:39.413
Enid?

42:17.535 --> 42:18.494
Where's Wednesday?

44:28.749 --> 44:29.833
I hate to admit,

44:30.334 --> 44:32.211
but I am gonna miss Principal Weems.

44:33.420 --> 44:34.630
She could be a real pain.

44:37.424 --> 44:38.550
But she was tough.

44:39.802 --> 44:42.971
And she died for the one thing
she truly loved, this school.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.601
For that, I have immense respect.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.646
She was one of us.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.034
Now that classes are canceled
for the semester,

45:04.118 --> 45:06.453
you have to come visit me
in San Francisco.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.289
I can pretty much guarantee
fog and drizzle every day.

45:09.373 --> 45:10.541
Sounds tempting.

45:11.041 --> 45:11.917
Bianca.

45:13.335 --> 45:14.837
I owe you a thank-you.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.715
We're getting that
fencing title next year.

45:17.798 --> 45:20.634
So don't let killing one
supernatural pilgrim get to your head.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.132
I hear you're a free man now.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.844
Yup. All charges dismissed.

46:05.471 --> 46:06.472
Listen.

46:06.555 --> 46:09.308
When I was in the cell
I said a lot of… things.

46:11.143 --> 46:12.728
Being your friend
should come with a warning label.

46:12.811 --> 46:17.191
But… I don't know a lot of people
who would take an arrow for me. So…

46:18.025 --> 46:20.152
Welcome to the 21st century, Addams.

46:27.242 --> 46:28.786
My number's in there already.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.163
That's a bold move.

46:32.372 --> 46:33.874
I hope you're not expecting me to call.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.001
No, never.

46:38.086 --> 46:39.254
I'd settle for a text, though.

46:42.674 --> 46:44.510
You know what a text is, right?

46:46.470 --> 46:48.055
Goodbye, Xavier.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.936
Hey, are you going to be back
next semester?

46:56.188 --> 46:57.606
Yes? No? Maybe?

47:31.723 --> 47:33.308
<i>My very first stalker.</i>

47:34.810 --> 47:38.355
<i>Maybe this forced vacation</i>
<i>will be more interesting than I imagined.</i>

47:40.190 --> 47:42.693
<i>Unlike my novel,</i>
<i>not every thread has been tied up,</i>

47:42.776 --> 47:44.653
<i>nor every question answered.</i>

47:44.736 --> 47:47.865
<i>Secrets are still lurking</i>
<i>in the dark corners of Jericho.</i>

47:53.412 --> 47:56.164
<i>Were Laurel Gates and Tyler</i>
<i>just pawns in a bigger game?</i>

47:57.499 --> 48:00.294
<i>Will today's stalker</i>
<i>become tomorrow's nemesis?</i>

48:05.090 --> 48:07.092
<i>I know the suspense is killing you.</i>
