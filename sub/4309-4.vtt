Honey, what time are kent
and joon coming over?

02:45.633 --> 02:46.865
Around 2:00.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.300
You almost ready?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.536
Just about.
Okay.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.238
We need to get propane
after church.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.480
Sure thing, hon.

03:04.417 --> 03:07.186
What's going on, teddy?

03:07.188 --> 03:09.388
Just watching tv, tawney.

03:09.390 --> 03:13.559
Is this still about
the loan paperwork?

03:13.561 --> 03:16.428
Could've had
a little more faith in me.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.731
That's why I signed it.
Eventually.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.634
I just... I needed a little bit
of time to think about it.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.536
The one time
I ask you to trust me,

03:24.538 --> 03:26.405
You got to think about it?

03:26.407 --> 03:30.275
See, I'm still a little mad.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.878
Is there something else
going on?

03:34.914 --> 03:37.549
Let me in, teddy.

03:39.752 --> 03:43.255
Just talk to me, honey.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.994
I still can't get over what you
told me about you and daniel.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.598
I thought I could,

03:52.600 --> 03:56.368
But I can't just snap my fingers
and get it out of my head.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.730
I'm sorry.
It's stuck in there.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.945
Thank you for being honest
with me.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.681
Now, why does everything
got to be so goddamn polite

04:09.683 --> 04:11.483
In this relationship?!

04:13.853 --> 04:16.421
Do you want me to start talking
like you, teddy?

04:18.625 --> 04:20.858
That make you happy?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.667
I'm gonna go to church.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.872
If you think of it, take
the fruit salad out in an hour.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.833
Hello, mother.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.468
Hey, sweetheart.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.837
Ted and I are gonna go
to the movies tonight.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.772
Thought you might want
to join us.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.374
I'm pretty busy, mother.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.543
That's good.
Packing.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.044
Oh!

05:46.046 --> 05:47.612
Did you say packing?

05:47.614 --> 05:50.349
Amantha?

05:50.351 --> 05:54.052
Yes, mother,
packing... Up.

05:57.358 --> 06:01.760
Honey, maybe I shouldn't have
said that about atlanta.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.463
No, mother, you were right.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.432
I don't belong here, no offense.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.102
Might be nice to get back
to your friends, huh?

06:10.104 --> 06:12.537
I didn't think of
making any real friends

06:12.539 --> 06:15.974
While I was there,
except with daniel's lawyer.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.909
Always thought it was temporary.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.512
Then... then stay here
for awhile longer.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.780
Why not?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.849
God, mom.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.052
I know, honey.
I'm sorry.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.997
What do you think?

07:14.801 --> 07:18.770
What do I think?

07:18.772 --> 07:22.808
Um, well, I-I think
I have looked at this painting

07:22.810 --> 07:25.010
For so long in a...
in a book

07:25.012 --> 07:28.480
That somehow my brain has...
has trivialized it.

07:28.482 --> 07:32.951
And, uh, now as I stand here
in front of the real thing,

07:32.953 --> 07:37.656
Uh, I feel, if anything...

07:37.658 --> 07:39.090
Disappointment.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.559
Oh, that's too bad.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.462
Well, n-not at the painting
itself...

07:43.464 --> 07:45.797
More at my brain I guess.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.466
I think the brain's afraid

07:47.468 --> 07:49.568
Of being in a state
of constant wonder.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.837
It's for safety reasons
or something.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.539
I suppose this is inevitable.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.675
Usually by the time we're four.

07:56.677 --> 08:01.746
Then there's the... the issue
of great expectations.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.715
Something the brain doesn't seem
the least bit interested

08:03.717 --> 08:05.183
In protecting us from.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.185
No.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.654
Well, I think we should
reinstate wonder,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.524
Banish expectation.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.059
I concur.

08:15.262 --> 08:19.030
We're moving on, dear.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.866
One of the things I try to do

08:20.868 --> 08:23.268
Is imagine myself
in the exact moment

08:23.270 --> 08:24.736
Of the artist's life

08:24.738 --> 08:28.139
Before the paint
even dries on the canvas

08:28.141 --> 08:30.775
Or when that last note
is written

08:30.777 --> 08:32.677
Or final sentence crafted.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.547
That does wonders for wonder.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.984
Sound advice.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.087
Well,
I don't always succeed, but...

08:45.259 --> 08:47.058
I'm peggy.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.696
Donald.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.532
Hi, donald.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.734
Good to meet you.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.836
Enjoy.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.954
Can I help you?

09:20.059 --> 09:23.028
Large diet coke, please.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.664
Anything else, ma'am?

09:29.802 --> 09:32.938
Ma'am?

09:50.356 --> 09:52.824
It's all twisted.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.060
I got it, mama.
Don't worry.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.361
Stupid thing.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.897
It gets stuck sometimes.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.165
There.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.912
Oh. Oh.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.947
Donald.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.083
Donald!

10:18.085 --> 10:19.351
Hi.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.153
Hello.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.955
Come over. Come on.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.860
Come...
come join us.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.895
I-I don't want to impose.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.764
Impose? How gallant.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.366
Well, you must sit with us now.

10:34.368 --> 10:37.235
Besides, we ordered
too much wine, anyway.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.371
Donald, these are my friends.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.072
Florene...

10:41.807 --> 10:44.643
...Anna lewis, and hazel.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.877
Hello, donald.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.812
Hello.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.414
- Maybe he's in that group.
- A.A.?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.082
Donald,
are you in a.A.?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.351
Uh, no.
Well, thank god.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.253
We've lost so many to them.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.057
Are you from atlanta, donald?

10:59.059 --> 11:02.160
Uh, no, I'm not.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.295
How mysterious.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.765
Enough with the questions.
It sounds like an interrogation.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.967
Where he's from?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.336
How is that inappropriate?

11:11.338 --> 11:15.807
I'm from alabama, actually.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.942
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.945
May we ask what he does, peggy,
or is that verboten, too?

11:22.448 --> 11:25.183
I own a bookstore there.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.352
Why does that not surprise me?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.721
It's small.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.456
Well, maybe you could recommend
something for our book club.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.024
Well...

11:33.026 --> 11:35.393
We just read
"the mermaid chair."

11:35.395 --> 11:36.795
Did you not just hate it?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.096
To be honest, I...

11:38.098 --> 11:40.031
The protagonist...
so pitiful.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.966
There is no point
in telling stories

11:41.968 --> 11:43.435
About people who are perfect.

11:43.437 --> 11:47.172
Well up to a point,
but, peggy, come on.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.174
What did you think, donald?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.910
Um, well, it's... it's always
subjective, isn't it?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.278
Mm-hmm.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.346
Well, at least say
you hated the monk.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.781
Please.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.283
I didn't care for him, no.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.318
Thank you.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.888
This bread is, um...
is excellent.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.991
It's, um, different.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.193
The panini bread?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.794
Yes.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.730
The palini... it's, um...

12:13.132 --> 12:16.067
It's unusually fresh here.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.937
Am I the only one
who is over panini bread?

12:18.939 --> 12:21.873
Panini bread.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.175
Mm.

12:34.286 --> 12:38.022
<i>We need</i>
<i>a cleanup on aisle 3, please.</i>

12:38.024 --> 12:40.458
<i>Cleanup on aisle 3.</i>

12:57.443 --> 12:59.144
Hello, mother.

13:01.046 --> 13:04.916
That's nice of you to offer,
but I already ate.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.085
What'd I eat?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.853
A salad.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.056
No, it was filling.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.426
It had cheese on it...
cheese and croutons.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.297
No, mother, I still don't want
to go to the movies tonight.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.066
Enjoying my solitude.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.935
You know, practicing.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.404
Alesha, could you get
on register two please?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.872
Hold on, mom.
Thanks.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.340
Do you have any moving supplies?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.843
Uh, we have packing tape
on the endcap.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.345
Bubble wrap?
Ugh, sorry.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.447
Um, maybe target.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.916
Thanks.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.818
Yep.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.886
Town's so small
you have to drive to mansfield

13:41.888 --> 13:44.022
To get bubble wrap.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.592
Bubble wrap, mom.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.995
Guess nobody ever moves
from here.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.132
I don't know
if I can get my deposit back.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.967
Melvin wasn't optimistic.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.904
Yeah, mom,
it's a lot of money to me.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.207
Got to go again.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.342
Hmm. Mamas.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.110
Uh-huh.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.613
It's $8.77.
Cash or credit?

14:08.615 --> 14:10.215
Credit.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.850
I could be having the best day,

14:11.852 --> 14:13.418
And then I talk to my mama.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.019
Heard that.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.889
Now, you have a great day now.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.332
There a problem?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.534
Can I get an application?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.603
For what?

14:31.605 --> 14:34.239
For the job advertised.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.573
For real?

14:35.575 --> 14:38.409
Yeah. For real.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.278
Okay.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.512
Uh...

14:43.048 --> 14:45.550
Why on earth would you memorize

14:45.552 --> 14:47.452
Tobias wolff's
"bullet in the brain"?

14:47.454 --> 14:48.920
It's a short story, florene.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.622
I don't care if it was a haiku.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.191
It was sad enough to read.
It'd be torture to memorize.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.960
No, it was...
it was calming, actually.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.262
Okay.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.364
More please.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.500
I-I don't know why,
exactly.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.204
Well, it was... it was during
a period of my life

15:06.206 --> 15:09.040
Where I was having
some difficulties

15:09.042 --> 15:12.644
Dealing with the passage of time
in a traditional sense.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.613
And since mr. Wolff's
short story

15:15.615 --> 15:20.285
Deals partly
with the bending of... of time,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.987
Well, in memorizing it,

15:22.989 --> 15:27.191
Or... or in taking the action
of memorizing it,

15:27.193 --> 15:33.598
I, too, was... was able
to bend time, in a way.

15:33.600 --> 15:40.405
Or at least
experience it... Differently.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.441
Nicely defended, donald.

15:45.544 --> 15:49.280
Well, we better get a move on if
we're gonna hit the gift shop.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.683
Tour group leaves in 20 minutes.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.686
Good to meet you, donald.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.154
Oh, m-my pleasure.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.355
Nice to meet you, donald.
Thank you.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.623
I'll catch up with you.
Okay, hon.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.492
Thank you.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.996
Bit much sometimes, the gaggle.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.397
No, no. Not at all.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.200
They were...
they were stimulating.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.136
We never talked about music.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.405
I'm curious.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.741
Truthfully, I...

16:16.743 --> 16:19.677
I haven't listened to much music
of... of late.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.312
Mostly reading.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.715
Well, surely you must be
a dylan fan.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.183
Well, of course.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.585
I listened to him some
as a teenager.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.421
A teenager? Donald.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.689
I'm... yeah. I know.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.758
I've been meaning
to get back to it.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.294
I saw him when he went electric

16:36.296 --> 16:39.330
In, well,
more than a few years ago.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.134
Talk about the paint
being still wet and alive.

16:43.136 --> 16:47.305
I can only imagine.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.243
Are you okay, donald?

16:53.479 --> 16:55.480
I don't mean to pry.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.616
No, it's, uh...

16:58.618 --> 17:03.221
I think that's perhaps for
a longer conversation one day.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.157
Of course.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.195
I'm gonna go catch up
with the girls, okay?

17:15.267 --> 17:16.701
Peggy, uh...

17:18.604 --> 17:20.137
Yes, donald?

17:20.140 --> 17:23.674
I really enjoyed meeting you.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.777
Likewise.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.246
And when I'm down in mobile,

17:28.248 --> 17:30.548
I'll come by your bookstore.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.286
I'd like that.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.764
You stop.
You told them. Oh, my god!

17:46.766 --> 17:49.133
It's not. It's not.
That's private.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.102
No, I'm the worst.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.503
You're so bad.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.372
Hi.
Hey!

17:54.374 --> 17:56.174
Hey, tawney. Hi.
Hey.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.575
Hey, baby!

17:57.577 --> 17:59.143
Good. Hey.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.312
Good. Kent.
What's up?

18:01.314 --> 18:02.647
They got here
a little early, so...

18:02.649 --> 18:04.248
I hope that's okay.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.783
We made really good time down
from hilton head.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.318
Oh, no. It's great.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.619
Yeah, I told joon
we can't just show up,

18:08.621 --> 18:10.254
But teddy said
we should come on over.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.457
And party's on.
You don't mind.
Do you, babe?

18:12.459 --> 18:14.258
No, of course not.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.860
I asked teddy
if I could help with anything,

18:15.862 --> 18:17.428
But he said
he had it all under control.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.629
Mm.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.264
I try. I sure do.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.732
I got the propane,

18:21.734 --> 18:24.402
Got the fruit salad out,
and table's almost set.

18:25.737 --> 18:28.272
How was hilton head, joon?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.607
A whirlwind.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.676
Uh, let me help with something.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.877
Do you want that peeled?

18:32.879 --> 18:35.279
Oh, um, that'd be great.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.415
Hey, buddy,
you know you can get yourself

18:37.417 --> 18:38.883
A nice vacation condo
for a song.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.518
You getting a place?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.553
Thinking about it.
I'm not a big beach person.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.190
Hey, mind if I put these out,
baby?

18:46.192 --> 18:48.559
Uh, nope. They're fine.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.361
Muy bueno.
Oh, my god.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.230
I cannot wait
for your muffins to be ready.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.898
Stop it.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.800
You need anything, babe?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.702
Uh, nope. I'm all good.
All right.

18:57.704 --> 19:01.506
Well, I am gonna get
the grill fired up.

19:01.508 --> 19:05.610
Give me a little something
to, uh, tide me over.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.479
Now, you want some company?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.762
Hey, hell yeah.
Come on.

19:13.852 --> 19:16.821
You two are so sweet together.
He just adores you.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.789
Yeah, I don't know about that.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.925
Kent said when he was off
at that tire conference

19:20.927 --> 19:24.328
That teddy was all like,
"tawney this and tawney that."

19:24.330 --> 19:25.930
Yeah.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.465
I'm sure kent
forgot he was married

19:27.467 --> 19:30.535
The minute
he walked out the door.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.503
Amantha holden.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.338
Two semesters of college.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.673
Didn't take to it?

19:35.675 --> 19:40.878
No, I actually liked it,
but I quit to be near...

19:40.880 --> 19:42.680
To go to work in atlanta.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.349
I know you've been through a lot
with your brother and so forth.

19:45.351 --> 19:49.620
So almost 11 years
at atlanta metro gas.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.855
Yeah.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.757
Third of my life at old metro.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.358
Did you like it?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.427
Not really.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.829
Just paid the rent.
You know?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.965
Did you ever work a register?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.401
No.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.735
Any experience in receiving?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.470
No.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.772
Stock shelves?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.707
I'm pretty sure
I can pick up on that.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.277
I'm sure you could.
Amantha, look, here's the thing.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.946
Peanut's already out
on baby leave,

20:14.948 --> 20:16.981
And the last girl
didn't work out.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.883
So we need somebody right away.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.520
I'm available whenever.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.755
We're not splitting the atom,
okay?

20:24.757 --> 20:26.824
I'm sure you could get
the hang of it pretty quick.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.293
But if you can't deal
with customers

20:29.295 --> 20:30.661
Or you get bored and quit on me,

20:30.663 --> 20:32.296
Then we're gonna be
short-staffed

20:32.298 --> 20:34.332
And I'm gonna have to go through
all this again.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.301
You see what I'm saying?

20:37.303 --> 20:39.604
I won't quit.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.439
I won't get bored.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.441
I didn't get bored at metro.

20:43.443 --> 20:48.012
Well, I got bored,
but I did a really good job.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.848
And I know I don't have
retail experience,

20:50.850 --> 20:52.850
But I'm a-a really quick
learner, and...

20:54.554 --> 20:57.255
I don't know
about long-term,

20:57.257 --> 21:03.761
But I need to be here right now
in paulie...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.964
For my brother.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.702
Well, thank you
for being honest with me.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.306
Like I said, I have a few other
applicants to consider,

21:15.308 --> 21:17.675
But we'll make a decision
very soon.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.044
Thank you for coming in.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.624
That's insane, teddy.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.326
You're just one store.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.861
There's no way you can compete
with the big rental chains.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.763
I don't have to.
Nearest chain's in macon.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.032
Yeah, because there aren't
enough customers around here

21:41.034 --> 21:42.767
To support a store.
No, they're here.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.635
You just got to reach them.
Yeah, sure.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.637
Then you're on the hook
when some lowlife

21:46.639 --> 21:48.306
Misses a payment
for $2,000 worth of chrome.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.474
That's a great plan, brother.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.076
The big rent-to-own chains,

21:52.078 --> 21:55.046
They're pulling in more than
$150 million a year, kent.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.881
All right, they can't do that

21:56.883 --> 21:59.750
If the customers aren't paying
their goddamn bills.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.585
Well, you got a point.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.521
Yeah, I do.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.356
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.857
Fine? Hell, it's a gold mine
is what it is.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.526
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds like it.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.827
I mean, we already got
the local brand awareness.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.462
That's important.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.732
Damn right it is.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.741
Better go get us
some fresh soldiers.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.076
Uh, don't trouble yourself.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.111
I got to think about
the drive home.

22:27.113 --> 22:30.548
Ain't no trouble.
I'll be right back.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.532
Can I help you?

22:48.534 --> 22:54.505
I believe there was someone
who, uh, o-once lived here.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.574
Okay.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.009
Named kerwin.

23:00.846 --> 23:03.614
Why is that your business?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.983
Well, I knew him.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.519
We were in prison together.

23:08.521 --> 23:13.023
Oh, my god.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.025
Are you daniel?

23:15.027 --> 23:19.930
I am. Yes.
I-I am daniel.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.932
Mama.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.735
Mama, it's...
it's kerwin's friend.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.537
Who?
Daniel.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.005
Daniel?

23:28.007 --> 23:31.108
The... ma, the white man...
the one who got out.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.548
Lord, have mercy.

23:39.652 --> 23:46.056
Daniel, look at you,
right here in my door.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.958
You by yourself, daniel?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.660
I am.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.496
Well, that's good.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.865
That's good, isn't it?

23:54.867 --> 23:57.835
It is good.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.838
Can I hug you, daniel?

24:00.840 --> 24:04.008
Please.

24:14.853 --> 24:17.588
Goodness gracious, and alive.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.831
Here, living and breathing.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.197
Hello, stefan.

24:26.199 --> 24:28.466
How you doing?

24:34.139 --> 24:36.240
The grate between our cells

24:36.242 --> 24:40.511
Was like an intercom of sorts.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.714
A lot of conversations, I bet.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.016
He liked to keep
the dialogue going.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.152
Oh, yeah.
That was kerwin, all right.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.955
I can still hear him sometimes.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.525
I heard that.

24:54.527 --> 24:58.062
Oh, kerwin carried on about you.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.631
"daniel this
and daniel that."

25:00.633 --> 25:02.266
He could lift you up.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.602
Please.
Thank you.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.674
Kerwin grew up so much in there.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.743
Yes, he did.

25:12.745 --> 25:15.179
In that awful place.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.281
He became a man.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.750
A decent man, too.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.052
He was that.

25:22.054 --> 25:26.824
So, how are things for you now,
daniel?

25:26.826 --> 25:29.059
It's been a bit
of an adjustment,

25:29.061 --> 25:32.563
But, uh, things are looking up.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.699
Well, your mama must be
beside herself.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.234
It was a big shock for her
at first,

25:37.236 --> 25:41.205
But, uh, she's...
she's cautiously optimistic.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.308
Well, mamas got to hold some
things back, 'cause y'all...

25:44.310 --> 25:46.277
yes.

25:46.279 --> 25:48.078
Boys.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.782
Worry your mother to death.

25:51.784 --> 25:52.850
Mm-hmm.

25:56.288 --> 26:01.592
Kerwin wanted me to come
and see you when I got out.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.294
Is that right?

26:03.296 --> 26:06.964
He said,
"not if but when, daniel."

26:06.966 --> 26:09.300
Had faith, did he?
Oh, yes, ma'am.

26:09.302 --> 26:12.069
A-and once he got something
in his head...

26:12.071 --> 26:14.605
Oh, no, that's right.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.007
He was that way
even as a little old thing.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.810
"first, you got to stop in
at mr. Gill's grocery store

26:19.812 --> 26:21.712
And get yourself
and orange soda."

26:21.714 --> 26:23.981
Kerwin loved
anything orange.
Oh, yeah.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.650
Now, the color, the taste,
even the word.

26:26.652 --> 26:29.019
He used to call it "ernge"
when he was young.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.022
Then he'd say, "you got to go
across the street

26:32.024 --> 26:33.824
"to mama's house,

26:33.826 --> 26:35.893
And she's gonna squeeze the air
right out of you, too."

26:35.895 --> 26:37.628
Oh.
"so get ready."

26:37.630 --> 26:39.330
Oh, he wasn't lying there,
daniel.

26:39.332 --> 26:41.265
Well, who hugs
without squeezing?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.601
Not you, mama.
Oh, hush, stefan.

26:43.603 --> 26:44.935
You know.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.704
And he'd say it so often
and with such conviction

26:46.706 --> 26:50.975
That, uh, sometimes
I could actually see myself

26:50.977 --> 26:54.345
Walking here right to your door.

26:54.347 --> 26:57.314
And then you did, daniel.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.850
Just like my baby said.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.654
B-but most of the time,

27:03.656 --> 27:10.260
I never, ever thought
I'd really get out.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.329
You know, I never knew

27:12.331 --> 27:16.300
Anybody got off death row,
you know, alive.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.903
No.

27:19.905 --> 27:23.941
Your mama must be so happy.

27:23.943 --> 27:27.144
Hugs you whenever she wants.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.014
Ah, come on, mama. Don't.
Don't now. Just...

27:30.016 --> 27:33.183
I know. I just can't help
thinking about my baby.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.819
Mama, daniel's not like kerwin,
okay?

27:35.821 --> 27:37.688
He didn't do nothing.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.423
No, I guess he didn't.

27:39.425 --> 27:42.092
I guess he didn't.

27:46.297 --> 27:48.165
I'm sorry.

27:48.167 --> 27:52.970
I-I have a, um...
I have a bus to catch.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.372
You heading home?

27:55.374 --> 27:58.175
Thank you.
Uh, yes.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.843
Yes, heading home.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.913
Oh, please.
Don't... don't rush off.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.816
Mrs. Whitman?

28:05.818 --> 28:07.718
Yes, daniel.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.021
Thank you for, um...

28:11.023 --> 28:13.057
Well, for kerwin.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.829
He was a good person,

28:18.831 --> 28:21.031
And he was my friend.

28:25.003 --> 28:27.771
I miss him every day.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.164
Hey.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.434
Thanks for coming by, daniel.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.037
I wasn't sure I should.

29:01.806 --> 29:05.008
Hey, good luck.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.978
Thank you.

29:23.995 --> 29:27.064
Any more muffins left?

29:27.066 --> 29:30.200
Um, maybe there's some
in the bread basket.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.369
Mm.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.305
Oh, I got you.

29:35.307 --> 29:39.309
You see the way old kent
scarfed down lunch today?

29:39.311 --> 29:42.980
I don't think joon spends
so much time in the kitchen.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.115
She makes me laugh.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.185
He can be a little negative
sometimes.

29:49.087 --> 29:50.988
Really? In what way?

29:55.527 --> 29:57.561
Come here.
Oh.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.931
Come on. You know,
want you to take a bite.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.066
I-I'm not hungry.
Here. Take a bite.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.588
I'm...
take a bite.

30:07.438 --> 30:09.506
You're such a good cook.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.943
Thank you.

30:12.945 --> 30:15.946
I'm so damn lucky.

30:24.589 --> 30:26.089
Teddy, can we please...

30:26.091 --> 30:27.291
Can we what?

30:27.293 --> 30:29.326
Ted.

30:31.062 --> 30:33.096
Oh, god.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.431
Teddy.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.033
Teddy!

30:36.035 --> 30:38.535
By god, you... you haven't
touched me in weeks,

30:38.537 --> 30:40.237
And now you got to be drunk
to...

30:40.239 --> 30:42.873
I don't have to be drunk.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.045
I'm sorry.

30:48.047 --> 30:51.448
Damn, tawney.
Will you ever be satisfied?

30:55.587 --> 30:59.056
I didn't mean "stop."
I just...

30:59.058 --> 31:02.259
You just scare me a little bit.
That's all.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.366
I scare you?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.602
No. No.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.136
I just...
no, no.

31:13.138 --> 31:19.076
So a convicted killer
doesn't scare you,

31:19.078 --> 31:21.511
But your own husband does.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.314
Don't put words in my mouth.

31:27.252 --> 31:29.732
Put something else
in your mouth.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.624
What is wrong with you?

31:35.593 --> 31:39.630
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.244
Order up.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.052
That will be $2.50.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.615
There you go.
Keep the change.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.691
Hey, you're that guy,
aren't you?

32:09.527 --> 32:12.396
The... the guy that got off
of death row.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.998
No, I'm not him.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.533
Yes, you are.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.602
Look, I don't mean to bother
you, mister, uh...

32:18.604 --> 32:20.504
It's holden, right?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.139
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

32:22.141 --> 32:25.042
Just wanted to say,
we followed your case.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.576
Real railroad job.

32:26.578 --> 32:30.213
We're just tickled you're out,
man. That's all.

32:30.215 --> 32:33.016
Um, thank you very much.

32:33.018 --> 32:34.952
I hope it's not too forward,

32:34.954 --> 32:37.554
But could... could we, like,
get a picture with you?

32:37.556 --> 32:40.958
O-okay, sure.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.659
Oh, great.
Uh, excuse me, miss.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.295
Could you take our photo?
Oh, yeah.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.231
The guy got off of death row.
Can you believe that?

32:48.233 --> 32:49.566
Oh, wow.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.201
Uh, sorry, mr. Holden.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.370
We got to get in kind of close.
It just looks better.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.605
Okay, yeah.
Just frame it up a little bit.

32:55.607 --> 32:58.288
There you go. Then you'll pre...
uh-huh. That's it.
Right here? Okay.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.445
Oh, thanks, hon.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.314
Oh.
Oh, it's good.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.582
You want me to send it to you?

33:05.584 --> 33:08.385
You on, uh, facebook
or instagram?

33:08.387 --> 33:10.187
N-no.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.588
- I get it.
- That's so crazy, right?

33:11.590 --> 33:13.123
I know.
Just keeps happening.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.658
I know.
I keep running into...

33:14.660 --> 33:17.194
No offense,
but oddballs like yourself.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.463
Kind of like that guy
that shot himself in the head

33:19.465 --> 33:21.031
Accidentally with a nail gun.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.566
You remember him?
Not really, no.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.334
Yeah, nail goes
straight through the roof

33:24.336 --> 33:26.703
Of this guy's mouth
to the tip of his brain.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.772
He doesn't even realize it until
he goes to the freaking dentist.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.741
I saw the news story,
and then it was like

33:30.743 --> 33:33.243
Two weeks later, I was...
I don't care.

33:34.545 --> 33:35.679
W-what?

33:35.681 --> 33:38.315
I don't care
about your boring story.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.117
You got your photo.

33:40.119 --> 33:43.653
So if you don't mind, I would
like to finish my dinner.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.223
What an asshole.
Rick.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.759
Look... look, I-I'm sorry.
No, really.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.228
I'm just not used to people...
look, I'm gonna
delete the photo.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.263
You don't have to
delete the photo.
Are you kidding, man?

33:53.265 --> 33:54.664
I-I don't want the photo.
Come on, rick.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.067
Dick.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.803
Think they let out
the wrong guy.

34:24.629 --> 34:27.230
Hello?

34:30.234 --> 34:32.768
Oh.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.172
Hi, ms. Lovaas.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.706
Wynn. Sorry.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.145
Really?

34:44.148 --> 34:45.649
No.

34:45.650 --> 34:49.186
No, that's... Great.

34:50.721 --> 34:53.223
It's good to hear.

34:54.692 --> 34:58.195
So is it full time or...?

34:58.197 --> 35:01.331
Oh, great.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.334
Um... Yeah.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.538
See you Tuesday.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.201
Hey, ted.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.636
Hey, carl.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.705
What brings you out this way?

35:41.707 --> 35:46.543
Oh, uh... I need to talk to you
about something.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.278
Sure.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.580
In confidence.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.582
You got it.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.718
Why don't you come in?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.587
It's about daniel.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.691
Something he did...

36:01.693 --> 36:04.694
To me.

36:06.731 --> 36:10.333
Come on in.

36:16.807 --> 36:20.310
Hello!

37:47.765 --> 37:50.300
Coffee grounds?

37:50.302 --> 37:52.902
Yeah. Coffee grounds.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.372
Just regular coffee grounds?

37:55.374 --> 37:57.507
Yeah, regular damn
coffee grounds, carl.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.509
You know,
medium-grind or whatever.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.944
I buy it in bulk at sam's.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.613
Okay, ted.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.782
So, when you woke up,

38:05.784 --> 38:08.718
The grounds had already been
placed back there?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.487
Yeah, they'd been placed
back there, all right.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.821
A big old pile of them.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.523
You don't
remember anything before?

38:13.525 --> 38:17.494
I mean, him pulling your pants
down or nothing?

38:17.496 --> 38:19.562
I told you, I was passed out

38:19.564 --> 38:20.964
From the choke hold
he put on me.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.565
You think I'd let him
pull my pants down

38:22.567 --> 38:24.934
If I'd have been awake?
No, no. Of course not.

38:29.373 --> 38:32.575
Was there, um...

38:32.577 --> 38:34.678
Penetration, ted?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.680
What?

38:36.682 --> 38:38.448
With the grounds?

38:38.450 --> 38:40.450
Well, yeah.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.886
I mean, you know, some of them
trinkled down in there.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.055
You know, like sand at the beach
or whatever.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.524
No, no.
What I mean, is, um...

38:47.526 --> 38:51.494
Was there penetration beyond
what had trinkled there...

38:51.496 --> 38:53.797
In an intentional way?

38:53.799 --> 38:56.833
Like he tried to shove them
up my ass?

38:56.835 --> 38:58.101
Basically.

38:58.103 --> 39:00.904
No. Hell, no, carl.

39:02.039 --> 39:04.507
You know how uncomfortable
this is to even talk about?

39:04.509 --> 39:06.476
Of course.

39:06.478 --> 39:09.412
I'm just trying to get
the specifics, ted.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.815
It's a big difference in the
eyes of the law if an object...

39:11.817 --> 39:13.683
In this case, coffee grounds...

39:13.685 --> 39:15.118
Had been forced
into your anal cavity...

39:15.120 --> 39:17.354
jesus, carl.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.022
...Rather than some
had just matriculated

39:19.024 --> 39:23.059
Into your,
uh... General crack area.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.562
Good god.
I can't believe...

39:25.564 --> 39:27.964
look.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.870
He may have patted them down
some to keep them in place,

39:33.872 --> 39:36.039
But this felt more like
some kind of symbolic thing,

39:36.041 --> 39:37.841
All right?

39:37.843 --> 39:40.844
Not like he was trying to shove
a pound of grounds up my b-hole.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.880
I mean,
it's all in hindsight, carl.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.951
Really?

39:47.953 --> 39:50.453
Un-goddamn-believable.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.927
Look, when I woke up,

39:57.929 --> 40:00.897
I didn't know what the hell
had happened, you know?

40:00.899 --> 40:02.732
I was a little disoriented.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.033
I'd imagine.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.871
Well, it sure would've been nice

40:07.873 --> 40:09.906
If you'd told me this
when it happened.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.975
What do you mean?

40:11.977 --> 40:14.844
Have a more solid case.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.847
I'm not pressing charges, carl.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.750
Ted, you got sexual assault,

40:20.752 --> 40:23.820
Maybe even attempted murder
with that choke hold.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.889
Who's to say
he didn't want you dead?

40:25.891 --> 40:27.624
He wasn't trying to kill me.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.186
He was trying to teach me
some kind of sick lesson.

40:35.199 --> 40:39.669
If you tell anybody about this,
carl...

40:39.671 --> 40:41.538
I swear to god.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.973
So, you just gonna let him
get away with it?

40:43.975 --> 40:48.044
I'll never live this down
in paulie.

40:50.681 --> 40:53.716
I'm gonna need your word
on this, carl.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.855
Okay.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.124
I won't tell anybody,
if that's what you want.

41:01.126 --> 41:05.829
It's exactly what I want.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.598
But I am curious

41:08.600 --> 41:11.835
As to why you'd even tell me
in the first place.

41:11.837 --> 41:15.071
I can't tell dad. No.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.940
Or my wife.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.942
I don't know, carl.

41:18.944 --> 41:23.713
I guess I... Just wanted you
to know what he's capable of.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.883
I know what he's capable of,
ted.

41:26.885 --> 41:30.553
I saw it in those woods
20 years ago.

41:32.556 --> 41:36.593
Does tell us one thing, though.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.161
What's that?

41:38.163 --> 41:41.965
The zebra didn't change
his stripes.

42:21.639 --> 42:24.941
You awake?

42:36.754 --> 42:39.656
I'm sorry.

42:51.602 --> 42:57.173
I'm so sorry, honey,
for what I said.

42:57.175 --> 42:59.943
For the way I've been acting.

43:05.215 --> 43:09.586
I'm glad you made it back.

43:24.902 --> 43:27.303
Just... geez, louise.
And she don't care?

43:27.305 --> 43:30.106
She's playing him.
I don't know.

43:30.108 --> 43:34.677
♪ The pouring light ♪

43:34.679 --> 43:37.780
