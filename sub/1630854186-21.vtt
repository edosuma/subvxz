WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:03.820
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:04.020 --> 00:05.550
I reached out to
a colleague who's doing

00:05.750 --> 00:09.290
a summer research program
at the University of Heidelberg,

00:09.490 --> 00:10.860
and I think
I can get you in.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.960
<i>Fantastisch.</i>
That's German for fantastic.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.930
This is my niece Tonya.

00:16.130 --> 00:16.960
She's staying with us.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.700
Hey, Missy.
Tonya.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.630
(quietly):
What are you doing?

00:20.830 --> 00:22.700
Sneaking out.
So, what's the plan?

00:22.900 --> 00:25.440
I got half a pack of cigarettes
and a bottle of cooking sherry.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.060
Let me get dressed.

00:29.260 --> 00:32.150
This will allow us to calculate
the speed of sound in the liquid

00:32.350 --> 00:35.550
using the standard elements of
the Einstein field equations.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.650
The answer is only
correct, of course,

00:37.850 --> 00:39.490
if the density
changes slowly.

00:39.690 --> 00:42.320
And to begin,
we use the standard equations

00:42.520 --> 00:44.790
of thermal physics
to simplify the answer--

00:44.990 --> 00:46.460
(sniffing)

00:46.660 --> 00:48.060
Wh-Wha-What am I smelling?

00:48.260 --> 00:51.200
Oh, that might be
my sauerkraut and knockwurst.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.920
It is.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.630
Why are you eating sauerkraut
in my classroom?

00:55.830 --> 00:58.700
I'm acclimating my body to
a Germanic meat-based diet.

00:58.900 --> 00:59.970
At 11:00 a.m.?

01:00.170 --> 01:01.510
It's dinnertime in Heidelberg.

01:01.710 --> 01:02.740
We're not in Heidelberg.

01:02.940 --> 01:04.210
But I will be over the summer,

01:04.410 --> 01:05.610
so I'm trying to adjust

01:05.810 --> 01:07.210
my internal clock
to the local time

01:07.410 --> 01:09.730
so I can hit the ground
running <i>mitout</i> jet lag.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.680
I'm got to get back to
my lecture,

01:11.880 --> 01:12.920
if that doesn't
interfere with your meal.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.890
Oh, dinner and a show,
I love it.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.490
Although...
would you be a lamb

01:16.690 --> 01:17.860
and open this jar of
mustard for me?

01:18.060 --> 01:20.260
Here are two words
you don't often hear--

01:20.460 --> 01:21.830
poor Germany.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.160
* *

01:23.360 --> 01:26.370
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

01:26.570 --> 01:28.700
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

01:28.900 --> 01:31.240
* I bet I could be your hero *

01:31.440 --> 01:34.370
* I am a mighty little man *

01:34.570 --> 01:39.400
* <i>I am a mighty little man.</i> *

01:41.400 --> 01:43.800
* *

01:45.670 --> 01:47.590
Hey.
MARY: Oh, good.
Can you do me a favor

01:47.790 --> 01:49.390
and run to the grocery store?

01:49.590 --> 01:51.260
There's a list there
on the island.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.930
Nice to see you, too.
(sighs)

01:53.130 --> 01:55.660
I'm sorry, I have to get
passports for Shelly and me,

01:55.860 --> 01:57.260
I've got to make sure that
the house is stocked,

01:57.460 --> 01:59.900
and now that he's read
about deep-vein thrombosis,

02:00.100 --> 02:02.140
I have to find compression
socks for the flight.

02:02.340 --> 02:05.270
"Chicken boo-eh-lon"?
What does that even mean?

02:05.470 --> 02:06.810
Bouillon.

02:07.010 --> 02:09.280
It's the tiny cubes that
turn into soup.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.140
So, the soup aisle?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.380
There you go.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.810
And you also need to
go to the drugstore.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.680
For what?
Missy needs...
some items.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.570
They're on the back
of the list.

02:20.170 --> 02:21.840
(sighs)

02:22.640 --> 02:24.320
You know, you seem
pretty stressed out

02:24.520 --> 02:26.890
Maybe it'd be easier
if I go to Germany.

02:27.090 --> 02:28.560
You got to be kidding.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.960
Well, it might make
more sense.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.400
I got the summer off...

02:31.600 --> 02:32.870
And, come on,
beer and sausage?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.770
I've been training
for that my whole life.

02:34.970 --> 02:36.370
Uh...

02:36.570 --> 02:39.740
Well, I guess that's
a possibility.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.440
It's just a thought.
Mm-hmm.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.840
I'll run to the grocery store,
we can talk about this later.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.280
If you're going to
the grocery store,

02:45.480 --> 02:46.610
you should get
more tinfoil.

02:46.810 --> 02:47.950
(sighs) You're not making
a hat, are you?

02:48.150 --> 02:50.650
No. I need it to
black out my windows.

02:50.850 --> 02:52.570
It's 10:00 p.m.
in Heidelberg.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.100
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

02:56.170 --> 02:57.720
(clucks tongue)

02:57.920 --> 02:59.730
(exhales)

02:59.930 --> 03:01.460
Tinfoil.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.030
(sizzling)

03:03.230 --> 03:05.600
Hey, thanks for
watching her.
No problem.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.970
She's my little
Hamburger Helper helper.

03:08.170 --> 03:09.340
Ain't that right?

03:09.540 --> 03:12.470
Hey, um, you got anything
going on this weekend?

03:12.670 --> 03:15.370
Uh, not much. Why?

03:15.570 --> 03:16.980
Well, at the baby shower,
I got a spa trip

03:17.180 --> 03:19.080
and I was thinking
about using it.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.950
I can watch CeeCee.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.980
No, it's for two people.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.870
I thought maybe
you and I could go.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.620
Like together?
Yeah.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.870
You deserve a break
as much as I do.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.330
Oh, uh...

03:33.530 --> 03:35.980
Sure, maybe.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.500
Okay, you don't seem
very excited.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.630
Well, what do guys do at spas?

03:40.830 --> 03:42.500
The same thing
that women do at spas.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.970
What do women do at spas?

03:44.170 --> 03:46.710
I don't know, spa stuff.
Let's find out.

03:46.910 --> 03:48.910
Oh, what about the baby?

03:49.110 --> 03:50.780
It's just one night,
Connie can watch her.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.880
Okay, fine, if she says yes,
then sure.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.150
Great. Oh!

03:55.350 --> 03:57.650
We can go to bed early,
we can nap...

03:57.850 --> 03:59.590
(gasps)
we can sleep in.

03:59.790 --> 04:01.390
Mm, exciting.

04:01.590 --> 04:03.040
Tell me about it.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.290
(whoops softly)

04:05.490 --> 04:07.490
So, Missy,
how was your day?

04:07.690 --> 04:08.590
Sheldon's not here--

04:08.790 --> 04:10.530
let's just enjoy
the silence.

04:10.730 --> 04:12.830
Mm, it is nice,
isn't it? (chuckles)
No.

04:13.030 --> 04:14.400
And if you think
it's so nice,

04:14.600 --> 04:17.040
why do you want to spend
two months with him in Germany?

04:17.240 --> 04:18.570
I thought Mom was going.

04:18.770 --> 04:20.710
We're exploring
our options.

04:20.910 --> 04:22.440
Well, I've been
thinking about it.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.010
You've traveled the world.

04:24.210 --> 04:25.610
I've never
left the country.

04:25.810 --> 04:28.010
The Army isn't
"traveling the world."

04:28.210 --> 04:29.280
More than I've done.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.680
Do I get a vote?
No.

04:30.880 --> 04:31.980
Wait, what's your vote?

04:32.180 --> 04:33.990
Mom goes.
You don't get a vote.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.820
And... you got to visit
Caltech with him.

04:37.020 --> 04:39.460
Seeing a college campus ain't
two months in Europe.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.860
I wouldn't know, would I?

04:41.060 --> 04:44.330
Mary, I've worked my ass off
for 20 years,

04:44.530 --> 04:45.700
I deserve this.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.770
Right, because what I do
is worthless.

04:47.970 --> 04:48.830
(sighs)

04:49.030 --> 04:50.140
Will you keep it down?

04:50.340 --> 04:51.600
It's the middle of
the night in here.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.240
* *

04:53.440 --> 04:55.570
Fighting over two months
of that?

04:55.770 --> 04:57.080
Okay...

04:57.280 --> 04:58.730
MEEMAW:
Hey.

04:59.530 --> 05:02.650
I hear you and Mandy are
going away for the weekend.

05:02.850 --> 05:05.180
Yeah, if you don't mind
watching the baby.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.850
I don't mind.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.150
You sure?

05:08.350 --> 05:09.590
You ain't ever watched her
overnight before.

05:09.790 --> 05:12.330
It's fine, we both wake up
a lot to pee.

05:12.530 --> 05:16.260
Well, if you change your mind,
I don't <i>have</i> to go.

05:16.460 --> 05:17.830
Do you not want to go?

05:18.030 --> 05:20.070
No, I do.

05:20.270 --> 05:22.370
Is this 'cause it's a spa
and you're worried about

05:22.570 --> 05:23.870
getting a massage
from a guy?

05:24.070 --> 05:26.870
Well, I wasn't.
But that ain't helping.

05:27.070 --> 05:29.120
(chuckling)
What's going on?

05:29.960 --> 05:32.650
Well, we've just never been
away from the baby

05:32.850 --> 05:34.350
this long before and...

05:34.550 --> 05:35.880
And...?

05:36.080 --> 05:40.090
Me and Mandy have never been
away alone together.

05:40.290 --> 05:42.360
You worried you're gonna
blow it with her?

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
No.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.770
Quit making me worry
about new things!

05:46.780 --> 05:48.330
* *

05:48.530 --> 05:50.900
ADULT SHELDON: <i>It may have</i>
<i>been midnight in Medford,</i>

05:51.100 --> 05:52.900
<i>but it was morning</i>
<i>in Heidelberg--</i>

05:53.100 --> 05:55.500
<i>the perfect time to enjoy</i>
<i>a hearty breakfast</i>

05:55.700 --> 05:57.670
<i>of leberwurst on pumpernickel.</i>

05:57.870 --> 05:58.970
(crunching)

05:59.170 --> 06:01.170
How do you say blech in German?

06:01.370 --> 06:02.910
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>I'll save you from googling.</i>

06:03.110 --> 06:06.160
<i>It's</i> eklig.
<i>You're welcome.</i>

06:13.940 --> 06:15.340
Where were you?
(gasps)

06:16.610 --> 06:18.920
Why are you up?
Go back to bed.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.760
I was enjoying a revolting
German breakfast.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.860
What's your excuse?

06:22.060 --> 06:23.330
It's none of your business.

06:23.530 --> 06:25.330
As your brother,
your safety is my business.

06:25.530 --> 06:28.330
I met my friend Tonya,
it's not a big deal.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.400
You smell like cigarettes.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.670
No, I don't.

06:31.870 --> 06:33.440
Perhaps a second opinion,
I'll get Mom.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.670
Sheldon,
stop and think.

06:34.870 --> 06:36.340
If I get in trouble,

06:36.540 --> 06:38.280
neither Mom or Dad is
gonna want to leave me

06:38.480 --> 06:39.580
and go to Germany.

06:39.780 --> 06:41.550
And if they don't go,
you don't go.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.620
But I have to go.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.250
Then you need to forget
this happened.

06:46.450 --> 06:48.890
I can't forget this happened--
I remember everything.

06:49.090 --> 06:51.990
Then when you're old and
not a famous scientist,

06:52.190 --> 06:54.490
you'll remember this is
the moment you blew it.

06:54.690 --> 06:57.030
* *

06:57.230 --> 07:00.050
Well? What's it gonna be?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.500
I'm going to brush
the liver out of my teeth

07:02.700 --> 07:04.150
and mull this over.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.210
ADULT SHELDON: <i>I was presented</i>
<i>with a moral dilemma.</i>

07:16.410 --> 07:17.580
(groans)

07:17.780 --> 07:19.350
<i>Cover for Missy</i>
<i>and protect my trip,</i>

07:19.550 --> 07:23.320
<i>or sing like a canary and</i>
<i>spend a muggy summer in Texas</i>

07:23.520 --> 07:25.560
<i>with my clean conscience.</i>

07:25.760 --> 07:28.460
Sheldon, everything okay?

07:28.660 --> 07:31.280
Yeah, Sheldon,
is everything okay?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.920
Everything is okay.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.340
What was that about?

07:40.540 --> 07:42.890
I don't know.
I just woke up.

07:43.930 --> 07:44.960
(yawns)

07:45.930 --> 07:47.430
(sighs)

07:48.730 --> 07:50.580
So, George really wants to
go to Germany?

07:50.780 --> 07:52.590
Yeah, he thinks
it'll be a vacation.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.520
Because the two things
that Sheldon loves are

07:54.720 --> 07:56.350
change and new people.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.020
Thank you.
So, which one of you
is gonna go?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.860
(sighs) We're still
discussing it.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.630
So, you?
Mm-hmm.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.230
Hi.
MEEMAW:
Hey.

08:04.430 --> 08:05.860
Did y'all get her down?
MANDY: Yeah.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.200
Finally. We're gonna head out
before she wakes up.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
I am so glad
you two are spending

08:10.600 --> 08:11.870
some quality time together.

08:12.070 --> 08:14.640
Mom.
No, she's right,
I mean, we earned it.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.140
I don't love that you're gonna
share a hotel room, but...

08:17.340 --> 08:18.210
Mom.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.210
Well, you're not married.

08:19.410 --> 08:20.580
Mom.
Stop.

08:20.780 --> 08:21.380
I'm done.

08:21.580 --> 08:22.980
She's not. Run.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.870
See ya.
Bye.

08:25.870 --> 08:27.820
Well, you know
you weren't.

08:28.020 --> 08:28.950
(door closes)

08:29.150 --> 08:30.760
(TV playing indistinctly)
MISSY: Okay.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.830
According to this quiz,
your TV boyfriend is...

08:34.030 --> 08:34.960
Bart Simpson.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.500
He's not even real.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.760
That doesn't matter.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.000
I still think about
marrying Alf.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.330
(both chuckling)

08:40.530 --> 08:42.400
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Look at them over there.</i>

08:42.600 --> 08:44.000
<i>They got away with</i>
<i>one transgression,</i>

08:44.200 --> 08:46.510
<i>and now they were clearly</i>
<i>plotting their next.</i>

08:46.710 --> 08:48.970
All right, we got away
with sneaking out.

08:49.170 --> 08:50.240
What should we do now?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.980
I say we rob the mall.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.180
You read my mind.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.010
We hit the shoe store first

08:56.210 --> 08:57.750
and then the makeup store.

08:57.950 --> 08:58.950
Smart.

08:59.150 --> 09:00.550
Those are the things
we girls like.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.150
(ominous music playing)

09:02.350 --> 09:04.120
GEORGE SR.:
You okay?

09:04.320 --> 09:05.560
Huh? What?

09:05.760 --> 09:07.390
You look a little
distracted.

09:07.590 --> 09:11.080
No, what would I be
distracted about?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.500
Eh, you got Germany coming up.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.340
Makes sense to be
a little nervous.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.940
That does make sense.
Yeah.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.270
Remember how scared you got
when we flew to Pasadena?

09:22.470 --> 09:25.010
(chuckles softly)
But we got through it.

09:25.210 --> 09:26.180
Together.

09:26.380 --> 09:27.550
We did.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.480
Germany's
way further than that.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.120
Your mom's never been on
a flight that long before.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.190
I have.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.050
When I was in the Army.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.560
Fighting for our country.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.540
Weren't you in the motor pool?

09:39.740 --> 09:41.960
I'm just saying,
if your mom gets nervous,

09:42.160 --> 09:44.030
you might be the one
calming her down.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.760
But that's what she does for me.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.370
Well, I'm sure
she'll do her best.

09:47.570 --> 09:51.040
But if she can't, there's
lots of strangers on the plane.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.460
You can hold one of their hands.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.310
(mumbles)
Hey.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.450
Hey, thanks
for coming.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.550
Ah, I'm not gonna pass
on a free lunch.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.950
I'm no dummy.
What you making?

10:06.150 --> 10:07.190
Chicken salad.

10:07.390 --> 10:08.390
(sniffs)

10:08.590 --> 10:10.120
Is it supposed to
smell like that?

10:10.320 --> 10:11.460
What?

10:11.660 --> 10:14.360
Oh, it's the baby.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.600
Uh, yeah, and people keep
having them.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.060
I don't get it.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.330
Could you change her
and let me finish up here?

10:20.530 --> 10:21.900
How do you mean?

10:22.100 --> 10:24.940
I mean, like, go get
a new diaper and put it on her.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.040
Oh.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.370
No, thanks.

10:27.570 --> 10:30.140
Don't you be a baby.
Go and change her.

10:30.340 --> 10:33.210
The first diaper I change
is gonna be my own.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.250
You've never changed a diaper?

10:35.450 --> 10:36.780
Not a one.

10:36.980 --> 10:39.080
You have kids.
And grandkids.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.650
How did you get away with
never changing a diaper?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.990
Mm. It wasn't easy.

10:44.190 --> 10:45.960
When there's
something's important to you,

10:46.160 --> 10:48.160
you find a way.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.500
Maybe we can do a sleepover
at your place.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.360
Why can't we do it here?
(knock at door)

10:52.560 --> 10:53.430
SHELDON:
Missy.

10:53.630 --> 10:54.830
(quietly):
That's why.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.270
Go away.

10:56.470 --> 10:58.370
SHELDON:
Why? What secret plot
are you hatching now?

10:58.570 --> 11:00.170
What's wrong with him?

11:00.370 --> 11:01.340
Literally, everything.

11:01.540 --> 11:02.980
(knocks on door)
SHELDON: Missy.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.240
Is he gonna
rat us out?
No.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.250
He's really smart but also
really dumb. Watch.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.270
Come in, Sheldon.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.050
What?
I've been reading up
on German history

11:15.250 --> 11:17.190
and I've realized that
appeasement

11:17.390 --> 11:19.730
in the face of rule-breaking is
a slippery slope.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.590
Let's say that
sneaking out was

11:21.790 --> 11:22.960
your "occupying
the Sudetenland."

11:23.160 --> 11:25.030
What's your "invasion of Poland"
going to be?

11:25.230 --> 11:26.460
I see it.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.570
(scoffs) What are you
talking about?

11:28.770 --> 11:29.970
If I can't tell
Mom and Dad on you,

11:30.170 --> 11:31.270
then I need you to promise
you won't break

11:31.470 --> 11:32.570
any more rules while I'm away.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.470
Fine, I promise.
Now get out.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.410
Excellent.

11:36.610 --> 11:37.960
Wait, how do I know
you meant that?

11:38.760 --> 11:42.450
Maybe she should promise
she was telling the truth.

11:42.650 --> 11:43.980
I like that.

11:44.180 --> 11:46.420
I promise I was
telling the truth.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.540
* *

11:49.700 --> 11:51.360
Wait, if you were lying
about the first promise,

11:51.560 --> 11:53.690
how do I know you weren't
lying about the second promise?

11:53.890 --> 11:55.710
I promise I wasn't.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.350
(groans)

12:00.120 --> 12:02.430
(door closes)
I think you broke him.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.240
No, he'll be back.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.540
SHELDON:
I will.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.320
(sighs)

12:08.720 --> 12:10.260
(lock beeps)

12:11.260 --> 12:13.050
(gasps)
Wow.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.780
Look at this.

12:14.980 --> 12:15.780
GEORGE JR.:
Uh-huh.

12:15.980 --> 12:18.620
Nice.
Oh, come on.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.220
You live in a garage.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.350
This is the nicest room
you've ever seen in your life.

12:22.550 --> 12:24.610
I said it was nice.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.860
Oh, my God.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.950
You have to feel this bed.
I may never leave.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.500
Yeah, that's something.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.740
Soft.
Okay.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.200
What is going on?
Do you not want to be here?

12:39.400 --> 12:40.740
What? I'm here.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.470
Are you that worried
about the massage?

12:42.670 --> 12:43.880
You know,
you don't have to get one.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.380
It ain't the massage.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.250
Well, it's a little
the massage.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.020
They ain't gonna touch
my butt, are they?

12:50.220 --> 12:52.150
Oh, yes. I ordered
the couples' butt massage.

12:52.350 --> 12:53.290
I paid extra for it.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.520
Really?
No, dummy.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.360
Oh, forget it.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.420
I thought this is
what you wanted--

12:59.620 --> 13:00.860
us together.

13:01.060 --> 13:02.780
I did.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.010
You did.
What changed?

13:06.850 --> 13:07.900
It's just different now.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.240
What's "different" about it?

13:10.440 --> 13:12.370
(knock at door)

13:12.570 --> 13:13.840
(door opens)

13:14.040 --> 13:17.280
Hi. I have you booked for
an in-room couples' massage.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.810
Now's not a good time.

13:19.010 --> 13:20.680
Screw you.
I'm getting a massage.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.930
Fine. But I'm keeping
my jeans on.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.200
Great.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.310
Hey.
Hey.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.660
Look,
I've been thinking...

13:36.860 --> 13:38.600
we've been making
this trip about us,

13:38.800 --> 13:40.270
and it should really be
about Sheldon.

13:40.470 --> 13:42.330
I agree.

13:42.530 --> 13:46.540
So... maybe he should have
some say in who goes with him.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.340
Why? What've you been
telling him?

13:48.540 --> 13:50.540
(snorts)
Nothing.
George.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.010
(sighs)

13:52.210 --> 13:53.850
He might've mentioned he was
nervous about the flight,

13:54.050 --> 13:57.220
and how great I handled it when
we flew to California, so...

13:57.420 --> 14:00.420
Did he mention it
or did <i>you</i> mention it?

14:00.620 --> 14:02.620
It's tough to say,
really.

14:02.820 --> 14:06.020
You are unbelievable.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.860
Sheldon, what has your
father been telling you

14:08.060 --> 14:10.160
about Germany?
What?

14:10.360 --> 14:11.360
Come on, Mary,

14:11.560 --> 14:13.030
don't try to
confuse the kid.

14:13.230 --> 14:14.070
I'm confused.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.230
It's his choice.

14:15.430 --> 14:16.370
What's my choice?

14:16.570 --> 14:17.940
Who you want to go
to Germany with you.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.600
I can't believe you're
putting him in the middle.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.110
I'm not putting him
in the middle,

14:21.310 --> 14:23.740
I'm treating him like the
responsible adult that he is.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.740
Missy's been sneaking out
of the house at night

14:25.940 --> 14:27.860
and I'm worried
she's going to rob a mall.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.750
I also think she's smoking.
(exhales)

14:31.950 --> 14:33.870
* *

14:40.780 --> 14:42.690
Sneaking out of the house?
Where did you go?
Nowhere.

14:42.890 --> 14:43.900
What were you doing?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.360
Nothing.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.700
Well, you went somewhere
and did something.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.950
Tonya, do you have
anything to say?

14:50.720 --> 14:53.040
No.
Why do you believe
Sheldon and not me?

14:53.240 --> 14:56.210
Because he's a Goody Two-shoes
and you stole my truck!

14:56.410 --> 14:57.510
Fine.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.580
We snuck out, but we
just walked around.

14:59.780 --> 15:01.350
Sheldon said you were smoking.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.950
And we learned
it's a disgusting habit.

15:04.150 --> 15:06.050
I know I learned my lesson.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.220
That's enough.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.570
(knock at door)
Come in.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.460
Mary, George,
thank you for the call.

15:12.660 --> 15:14.960
Tonya, apologize to the Coopers.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.930
Sorry.

15:17.130 --> 15:18.400
Oh, you're gonna be.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.450
Our trip to the Noah's Ark
petting zoo, that's off.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.840
I'm too old for that anyway.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.400
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
realize 14 was too old

15:26.600 --> 15:28.570
to pet two of
many kinds of animals.

15:28.770 --> 15:29.810
Come on.

15:30.010 --> 15:31.640
Your parents are
getting a phone call.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.810
Great, maybe they'll send me to
live with my fun uncle.

15:34.010 --> 15:37.220
Jerry is not fun,
and he's in rehab.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.580
(Mary sighs)

15:38.780 --> 15:40.250
I hope you don't have
any plans for the summer,

15:40.450 --> 15:42.290
because you're not
leaving the house.

15:42.490 --> 15:43.620
That's like three months.

15:43.820 --> 15:45.220
Oh, you want to
make it Christmas?

15:45.420 --> 15:46.760
(scoffs)
Whatever.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.880
There's nothing to do
in this stupid town anyway.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.500
(slams door)

15:51.700 --> 15:53.570
Any chance we can both
go to Germany?

15:53.770 --> 15:55.570
(sighs)

15:55.770 --> 15:59.370
Oh, you are holding
a lot of tension in here.

15:59.570 --> 16:01.110
Huh, I wonder why.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.280
GEORGE JR.:
Do I feel tense?
Oh, I bet I feel tense.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.910
You are a little tense.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.550
Huh, I wonder why.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.110
GLORIA:
Have you been drinking
enough water?

16:09.310 --> 16:10.250
Because often when...

16:10.450 --> 16:11.850
No, that ain't it.
(scoffs) No.

16:12.050 --> 16:15.250
It's my fault, for inviting him
on a romantic getaway.

16:15.450 --> 16:18.390
It is your fault.
Oh, one sec--

16:18.590 --> 16:20.460
(groaning)
Really get in there.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.660
Oh... yeah.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.400
(grunts) Okay, where was I?

16:25.600 --> 16:27.670
This is what you do--
you act all into me,

16:27.870 --> 16:29.570
then you get weird
and push me away.

16:29.770 --> 16:30.770
Okay, that's not true.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.700
Yes, it is.
You sleep with me,

16:32.900 --> 16:34.810
then you tell me to
date other people.

16:35.010 --> 16:36.810
I ask you to marry me,
you say no.

16:37.010 --> 16:38.610
Why is this time gonna be
any different?

16:38.810 --> 16:41.650
I-I don't know.
Maybe I'm ready now.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.020
"Maybe"?

16:43.220 --> 16:44.480
Yeah.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.720
(sighs)
Look.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.420
We're getting' along, we're
a good team with CeeCee...

16:49.620 --> 16:51.360
Maybe I don't want to
risk that on a maybe.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.090
Okay, if you don't want to try,
why did you even come here?

16:54.290 --> 16:56.430
Well, I didn't want to say no
and make things weird.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.710
Oh, well, you nailed it.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.680
(grunts)

17:02.980 --> 17:04.040
<i>(knock at door)</i>

17:04.240 --> 17:06.990
Missy?
MISSY:
Go away.

17:09.460 --> 17:10.640
I know you're angry

17:10.840 --> 17:13.160
but I was genuinely
worried about you.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.720
I realize we have
our differences, but...

17:17.920 --> 17:19.450
I would never be able to
forgive myself

17:19.650 --> 17:21.600
if anything bad happened to you.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.210
I hate you.

17:29.410 --> 17:31.610
* *

17:32.810 --> 17:35.230
(TV playing indistinctly)

17:35.430 --> 17:36.930
I'm gonna give
CeeCee a bath.

17:37.140 --> 17:37.940
Do you want to help?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.070
Nah, I'm good.

17:39.270 --> 17:40.440
Let me guess...

17:40.640 --> 17:42.470
you've never given
a baby a bath either.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.780
It was a different time.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.410
You gonna tell me
your husband did all that stuff?

17:47.610 --> 17:48.680
Not really.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.480
Eh, you see?
Look, you got a type.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.950
Well, it's not the '50s anymore.

17:54.150 --> 17:56.900
I'm gonna give her a bath
and you're gonna help.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.160
Fine.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.510
And afterward, you're gonna
change her diaper.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.560
Ah, man, I miss the '50s.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.750
What was that?
Nothing, I'm coming.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.700
Whoa, take it easy,

18:10.900 --> 18:12.640
that towel didn't
sneak out of the house.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.410
How can you make a joke?

18:14.610 --> 18:16.210
(sighs)
Sorry.

18:16.410 --> 18:17.640
I don't know
what else to do.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.740
We were both here
and she snuck out.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.450
What's gonna stop her
from running wild

18:21.650 --> 18:23.130
if it's just one of us?

18:23.930 --> 18:25.780
Oh, so you're saying neither
of us should go to Germany?

18:25.980 --> 18:28.490
(exhales)
I don't know.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.390
I don't want to punish Sheldon,
but I'm worried about Missy.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.130
I am, too.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.780
(Mary sighs)

18:36.710 --> 18:38.880
But I think you should go.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.670
You do?
I got the summer off.

18:42.870 --> 18:45.820
My full-time job can be
keeping her in line.

18:46.890 --> 18:48.310
You sure you're up
for that?

18:48.510 --> 18:49.870
Mary, I'm a football coach.

18:50.070 --> 18:52.160
I can handle
a 13-year-old girl.

18:53.130 --> 18:55.210
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Missy snuck out 32 times</i>
<i>that summer,</i>

18:55.410 --> 18:58.450
<i>and got</i>
<i>her belly button pierced.</i>

18:58.650 --> 19:01.640
<i>The poor guy had no idea.</i>

19:07.480 --> 19:09.790
* If I hadn't blown
the whole thing years ago *

19:09.990 --> 19:11.660
* I might not be alone *

19:11.860 --> 19:14.430
* Tomorrow we can drive
around this town *

19:14.630 --> 19:17.520
(sighs)
(turns radio off)

19:20.360 --> 19:22.160
All right, let's get married.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.080
What?

19:24.280 --> 19:26.890
You think
I'm not all in, but I am.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.630
Okay. I am, too.

19:32.530 --> 19:33.490
Okay.

19:33.690 --> 19:36.170
So, we're really doing this?

19:36.970 --> 19:38.410
Yeah.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.300
What are you doing?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.360
I ain't waiting to
get home to kiss you.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.680
(laughs)
