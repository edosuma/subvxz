A-game today.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.122
The scout from
State is watching.

Astral, you're going
off the deep end.

Your teammates,

no one's gonna want
to be around you.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.178
This is
just a game.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.139
No, it's
a victory.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.475
It's being better
than everyone else.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.101
It's making
me stronger.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.936

Astral I know.

You let

I mean I'm glad I'm not in

Thrown perfectly!

You had
her.

You blew it.

Young lady,
impressive.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.406
Maybe with a
little more practice

19:17.489 --> 19:18.323
you could
play for state.

I think my dodgeball
days might be over.

Hey coach,
what about me?

19:22.452 --> 19:24.288
I'm available.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.709
She didn't
say no.

C'mon, killer, I'll
buy you a protein shake.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.464
{\an1}I'd rather
have french fries.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.509
I've never
apologized before

19:37.593 --> 19:40.137

you to make Tristan jealous.

didn't hear what she said.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.429
I know.
