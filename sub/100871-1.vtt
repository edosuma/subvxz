00:32.540 --> 00:33.840
Movement, roof!

00:35.486 --> 00:36.986
Contact!
Contact!

01:08.347 --> 01:09.914
JoJo?

01:36.226 --> 01:37.475
Asana?

05:45.810 --> 05:48.732
I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

05:52.993 --> 05:56.711
All the "should-have" s
can make a man old.

05:58.714 --> 06:00.547
You must be ancient.

06:01.303 --> 06:04.326
Yes, there is that.

06:23.794 --> 06:26.471
When I get out of here,
you'll be fucking sorry.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.507
No one really gets out.

06:31.122 --> 06:32.811
I feel sorry for you.

06:32.991 --> 06:34.608
You feel sorry for yourself.

06:37.844 --> 06:39.780
I do when no one's looking.

06:44.183 --> 06:48.228
You're not like them.

06:48.549 --> 06:49.617
No...

06:52.700 --> 06:54.915
but I am caught in the same web.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.872
How long do I have?

07:01.488 --> 07:03.205
It's not for me to say.

07:03.288 --> 07:04.708
Just for you to do?

07:07.712 --> 07:08.962
You don't understand.

07:09.509 --> 07:10.897
What's to understand?

07:10.953 --> 07:12.482
You're a traitor.

07:15.481 --> 07:17.216
Easy for you, then.

07:49.604 --> 07:51.229
A white man made that up.

07:51.323 --> 07:52.798
Huh.

17:41.285 --> 17:44.288
Are you afraid of the dark?

17:46.626 --> 17:49.997
Maybe when I was a
child squatting in the dirt.

17:52.133 --> 17:53.868
Now?

17:55.234 --> 17:56.902
It was scared out of me.

18:13.379 --> 18:15.280
You're an American.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.251
Canadian.

18:18.550 --> 18:21.669
You amaze me with the idea that
there is a difference here.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.059
You are all the same.

18:26.428 --> 18:27.807
Unwelcomed.

18:31.098 --> 18:33.066
You're a spy.

18:33.476 --> 18:35.102
A soldier.

18:35.253 --> 18:38.046
A to-mah-to or to-may-to?

18:38.264 --> 18:39.527
The law under your feet

18:39.613 --> 18:42.850
proclaims you will
be tried as a spy.

18:43.487 --> 18:47.613
Punishable by death.

18:47.810 --> 18:49.271
Are you afraid now?

18:52.959 --> 18:55.618
Something to think
about in the dark, yes?

19:11.206 --> 19:15.308
You didn't ask my name?

19:16.277 --> 19:18.577
My name is Ramiz.

19:19.001 --> 19:21.069
Ramiz...?

21:28.254 --> 21:30.056
You guys better watch your step.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.312
Jesus, Sweetie, man.

21:33.406 --> 21:34.829
Pay attention.

21:34.907 --> 21:37.256
Watch where you're walking.

21:37.455 --> 21:39.541
Ladies first, eh?

21:39.736 --> 21:41.546
Jeez, ever creepy.

21:41.695 --> 21:44.215
Horror movie freaky.

21:44.356 --> 21:46.911
More like Residential
School creepy.

21:46.966 --> 21:48.363
Fuck.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.460
Say it again.

21:49.578 --> 21:51.456
Say what again?

21:51.754 --> 21:53.548
"Residential school," or "fuck"?

21:54.595 --> 21:56.183
Fuck residential school.

21:56.234 --> 21:57.969
Get that shit off your head, Sweetie.

22:18.079 --> 22:20.251
Dylan! Dylan!

22:20.389 --> 22:21.500
Stand down!

22:21.672 --> 22:24.422
Down!

22:24.655 --> 22:26.091
They took her.

22:26.206 --> 22:28.774
My daughter, Khatira.

22:29.035 --> 22:31.062
It's Aman, the translator
from camp.

22:39.380 --> 22:40.915
Movement, roof!

22:48.369 --> 22:49.437
Contact! Contact!

23:00.281 --> 23:02.116
Gone. Sweetie, man.

23:20.569 --> 23:21.928
It's going to be okay.

24:18.264 --> 24:21.414
Please... not in
front of my children.

29:00.609 --> 29:01.719
Boom!

33:40.123 --> 33:41.525
Asana...

33:41.817 --> 33:44.452
Asana...

34:22.393 --> 34:25.228
You call yourself a soldier.

34:27.290 --> 34:28.257
I'm a warrior.

34:28.455 --> 34:29.422
A warrior?

34:34.386 --> 34:35.870
I am protecting my country.

34:35.958 --> 34:40.194
You are on my land
protecting your country?

34:40.485 --> 34:43.023
Who's the crazy one now? Hmm?

34:43.181 --> 34:45.135
Maybe you are the crazy one.

34:45.228 --> 34:47.199
Maybe you're right.

34:47.232 --> 34:48.599
You agree you're wrong?

34:51.070 --> 34:54.324
I agree I'm fucked.
Let's agree on that.

34:54.395 --> 34:56.094
Agreed.

34:56.172 --> 34:58.553
See how easy it is to get along?

34:58.672 --> 34:59.673
Hmm?

35:06.376 --> 35:08.378
Give it back!

35:10.147 --> 35:13.083
I don't take orders
from fucked warriors.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.342
Nice.

35:18.755 --> 35:21.510
What is written here?

35:21.588 --> 35:23.991
These notes are
written in code...

35:24.894 --> 35:27.262
..the language of spies.

35:29.841 --> 35:31.627
I don't want to
hurt you, my friend.

35:32.776 --> 35:35.646
I am not your friend.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.038
It is a saying.

35:43.139 --> 35:46.109
Not where I come from.

35:59.836 --> 36:02.465
English, and the other language?

36:26.804 --> 36:32.204
It is the Taliban who
are the teachers now.

36:32.768 --> 36:34.872
Isn't that right, Tahir?

36:35.472 --> 36:37.275
What do you think you
are teaching?

36:37.923 --> 36:39.411
The word of Islam.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.501
You're Christian, yes?

36:42.617 --> 36:43.398
No.

36:43.499 --> 36:44.903
No?

36:44.981 --> 36:46.937
So what religion do
you believe in?

36:47.133 --> 36:48.186
Hmm?

36:48.383 --> 36:49.487
Let me guess.

36:49.876 --> 36:51.705
No religion.

36:51.819 --> 36:55.990
You are faithless, groundless,
you're lost.

36:56.461 --> 36:58.421
Your country and
your will to believe

36:58.505 --> 36:59.684
failed you.

37:03.842 --> 37:06.310
I'm glad you find it amusing.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.335
Unless your grieving
family and pitiful country

37:18.413 --> 37:20.385
has the money to
bargain for your life.

37:21.036 --> 37:22.682
That's what this show is about?

37:22.752 --> 37:24.905
Life is a barter, my friend.

37:24.975 --> 37:26.358
You became a commodity

37:26.389 --> 37:28.299
when you set a
foot on my country.

37:28.385 --> 37:30.158
You just didn't know it.

37:31.559 --> 37:34.261
And you know
everything, I suppose?

37:35.410 --> 37:36.411
I know...

37:36.784 --> 37:38.034
...who you are.

37:57.385 --> 37:59.329
Did you know, Dylan,

37:59.430 --> 38:02.236
some people feels
translating itself

38:02.318 --> 38:04.720
is an act of betrayal?

38:18.105 --> 38:22.697
We know a traitor has many
tongues and many faces.

38:22.799 --> 38:25.317
Don't we, Dylan?

38:25.797 --> 38:28.486
Something we share...

38:29.332 --> 38:31.100
however painful.

39:33.949 --> 39:35.718
What country do you come from?

39:39.517 --> 39:41.118
Your name?

39:44.586 --> 39:45.854
English!

39:46.449 --> 39:48.184
Your family?

39:51.686 --> 39:53.554
In English.

39:57.893 --> 40:00.315
I will ask you my
question again,

40:00.387 --> 40:03.407
and you will answer
them in English!

40:25.752 --> 40:27.820
First Nations Canadian.

40:38.262 --> 40:42.089
Deep down, we always
wanted to be the Indian,

40:42.198 --> 40:44.221
didn't we Aman?

40:44.517 --> 40:47.158
I think everyone does.

40:47.507 --> 40:49.126
So free.

40:49.427 --> 40:51.829
So much spirit.

40:51.975 --> 40:54.231
You're the Indian
here, aren't you?

40:54.583 --> 40:57.101
Clever.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.570
But we are not like you, Dylan.

40:59.748 --> 41:03.007
Your Indians always
lose in Hollywood movies.

41:03.151 --> 41:05.042
And your Indians don't?

41:05.230 --> 41:06.507
Your Indians die.

41:06.562 --> 41:08.012
And your people don't?

41:08.114 --> 41:11.115
I'm getting tired of this.

41:11.223 --> 41:12.387
You want to be the cowboy.

41:12.449 --> 41:13.918
I want you to shut up.

41:13.951 --> 41:16.166
So said the Indian who
acts like a cowboy

41:16.265 --> 41:18.901
with a fuckin'
turban on his head!

42:04.068 --> 42:06.401
Where were you captured?

42:06.493 --> 42:12.366
I was taken in Panjawai,
in an ambush.

42:12.594 --> 42:16.431
I am now being held
captive by the Taliban.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.150
Do you know where you are now?

42:19.462 --> 42:21.652
No.

42:21.841 --> 42:23.109
How have you been treated?

42:27.931 --> 42:31.968
Again, English,
with more conviction.

42:44.888 --> 42:47.958
I have been treated like...

42:48.233 --> 42:50.535
...like I was one of them.

43:55.956 --> 44:02.129
It proves that you are not
just a warrior, as you said.

44:02.319 --> 44:03.920
You are a spy.

44:04.015 --> 44:07.852
It proves nothing.

44:08.058 --> 44:10.454
You will translate
this for me now

44:10.555 --> 44:13.475
so your family and
your government

44:13.569 --> 44:19.103
can see that we are righteous
in our prosecution of you.

44:30.741 --> 44:33.638
What does it mean?

44:33.778 --> 44:35.980
I said, what does it mean?

44:45.434 --> 44:48.636
"Snow that brings a
new beginning."

44:57.249 --> 45:02.688
Why so sad at such
beautiful words?

45:02.869 --> 45:04.738
I should have said...

45:13.477 --> 45:17.133
I asked you why
you're really here.

45:17.408 --> 45:21.790
I asked you why you
speak this crazy language.

45:21.913 --> 45:25.439
You are not just a
simple Canadian soldier.

45:25.489 --> 45:28.422
You are here on a
secret mission.

45:31.445 --> 45:34.584
You say you're worth nothing to
your family and your country.

45:38.076 --> 45:41.271
I didn't say that.

45:41.396 --> 45:45.021
I said my family has no money.

45:45.132 --> 45:47.513
We live like you,
except more snow.

46:18.024 --> 46:19.435
You say your
country wouldn't care

46:19.491 --> 46:21.859
if I were to kill you here.

46:22.047 --> 46:23.368
I don't think they
would care enough

46:23.442 --> 46:25.578
to bargain for me.

46:28.613 --> 46:31.215
That's what we're
talking about, right?

46:33.337 --> 46:35.806
You are a realistic man.

46:38.997 --> 46:42.868
Being Indian makes
you clear-sighted.

46:44.516 --> 46:47.017
What do you know of Islam?

46:47.051 --> 46:49.621
Nothing.

46:49.776 --> 46:53.257
As much as I want to
know of Christianity.

46:55.959 --> 46:57.928
You're going to ask me
if I want to convert.

46:58.032 --> 47:01.065
I will spare you.

47:01.176 --> 47:06.181
The Christians would
say, "I will save you."

47:07.371 --> 47:10.474
Then they'll fuck you.

47:11.014 --> 47:14.286
Sometimes literally.

47:14.387 --> 47:17.256
Comparing me to those savages?

47:17.577 --> 47:23.424
I'm saying extreme beliefs can
change the true face of a god.

47:25.218 --> 47:29.013
We are not at the United
Nations holding hands

47:29.076 --> 47:31.362
in a mud hut.

47:31.690 --> 47:33.102
Worthless.

47:33.198 --> 47:35.238
You are worthless to
your own country,

47:35.318 --> 47:37.839
makes you worthless to me.

48:18.769 --> 48:20.634
{\an8}We will start with your kidneys.

49:26.435 --> 49:27.293
{\an8}Tahir...

49:31.379 --> 49:32.718
It's going to be okay.

50:45.455 --> 50:47.322
"Never say die"?

50:49.038 --> 50:50.739
Ironic, isn't it?

51:25.021 --> 51:27.093
Beg for your life.

51:27.296 --> 51:29.310
My grandmother taught
me to bow to no man.

51:29.412 --> 51:31.694
Yet you are below me.

51:32.032 --> 51:34.666
My spirit isn't.

51:52.976 --> 51:54.889
{\an8}You fucking traitor!
I trusted you!

51:55.766 --> 51:57.390
Let him go!
Now!

51:57.490 --> 51:59.325
Every fucking time...

51:59.592 --> 52:01.543
{\an8}There's been enough
killing for today!

53:01.445 --> 53:03.269
Who's the fucked warrior now?

53:13.161 --> 53:15.462
Today you win.

55:55.418 --> 55:57.293
It's time to leave.

55:57.413 --> 55:59.373
What makes you think
I'm coming with you?

55:59.483 --> 56:00.930
We're your only hope.

56:00.963 --> 56:02.198
That's comforting.

56:02.339 --> 56:03.765
I'll take my chances.

56:03.882 --> 56:06.202
They will be
returning before dark.

56:06.235 --> 56:07.203
There is nowhere to hide

56:07.280 --> 56:10.217
unless you already
know where to go.

56:11.868 --> 56:13.997
Do what you want.
I don't care.

56:28.222 --> 56:31.158
Do you know how to ride a bike?

57:05.924 --> 57:08.627
We'll rest here until
late afternoon.

57:08.871 --> 57:11.574
We have enough gas to
get close to half way.

57:11.646 --> 57:14.696
We will walk from there.

57:14.790 --> 57:16.888
I should find my
way back to my camp.

57:16.960 --> 57:19.262
There is no going back.

57:19.678 --> 57:21.829
By now, every road, every rock

57:21.899 --> 57:25.381
between Spin Bolduc and our
house has been turned.

57:25.901 --> 57:28.050
You are not a soldier now.

57:28.307 --> 57:30.886
You are a trophy.

57:31.596 --> 57:33.865
And you?

57:35.259 --> 57:38.162
I am a dead man.

57:38.461 --> 57:41.364
My family, the same.

57:42.231 --> 57:45.401
The enemy you don't know is
sometimes a safer bet.

57:45.502 --> 57:47.403
You are an optimistic man.

57:48.472 --> 57:49.925
If we make it to the hills

57:50.011 --> 57:53.242
without being caught by the
Taliban we're running from,

57:53.562 --> 57:56.930
if we make it through the
pass without being killed

57:56.993 --> 57:59.791
by the Taliban patrols we
are running into,

57:59.880 --> 58:02.816
the Pakistani Taliban,
the snipers and thieves...

58:02.952 --> 58:04.993
and that is just what
we can see coming.

58:05.091 --> 58:07.026
There are many ways to
die before the day is out,

58:07.123 --> 58:10.126
and it will take us three
days to get to Pakistan.

58:10.159 --> 58:11.760
You do the math.

58:15.973 --> 58:17.513
{\an8}No, everything is great.

58:22.818 --> 58:24.954
Leave.

58:25.095 --> 58:27.264
You've done enough
damage to our family.

58:27.609 --> 58:28.581
What are you talking about?

58:28.656 --> 58:31.312
My unit is dead because
of your father.

58:31.414 --> 58:34.283
You think you're the only
one who has lost everything?

58:34.316 --> 58:36.081
He was getting night letters.

58:36.159 --> 58:38.614
Letters threatening
him, and then us.

58:38.700 --> 58:41.412
Your government
promised safety, a visa.

58:41.474 --> 58:43.292
Nothing.

58:43.325 --> 58:46.395
It was only a matter of
time before they came for us.

58:46.560 --> 58:49.128
Why do you think I
was kidnapped?

58:49.237 --> 58:51.655
Because my father was
working for you.

58:51.823 --> 58:56.061
Because he was translating
for you, the Canadian Army.

58:56.834 --> 58:58.908
What would you have done?

58:59.558 --> 59:00.592
{\an8}Answer me!

59:06.313 --> 59:07.375
Khatira.

59:29.205 --> 59:31.053
Canadian. Fuck!

59:35.970 --> 59:37.043
{\an8}I'm crazy?

59:40.322 --> 59:42.624
{\an8}There you have it.
Just a matter of time, eh?

59:46.841 --> 59:48.294
Let him go, Dylan.

59:48.357 --> 59:50.392
He is just a boy.

59:50.503 --> 59:51.493
Let him go.

59:51.690 --> 59:53.892
Please!

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:04.035
He's gonna run and talk.

01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:06.134
Yes.

01:00:06.234 --> 01:00:09.304
Being a human being costs...

01:00:09.962 --> 01:00:12.331
but I am tired of death.

01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:15.112
There will be no rest.

01:00:15.205 --> 01:00:17.774
We should go if we want to live.

01:01:21.727 --> 01:01:23.428
You know, when you are a child,

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:27.890
a stick is a stick, or a gun.

01:01:28.411 --> 01:01:32.161
When you're a man,
your choices narrow.

01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:46.978
I'll do the watch tonight.

01:02:36.229 --> 01:02:37.997
Sit. Eat.

01:02:59.848 --> 01:03:03.552
Where is Tahir's mother?

01:03:03.919 --> 01:03:06.020
Your mother?

01:03:06.098 --> 01:03:07.690
She is dead.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.059
Executed for teaching girls.

01:03:16.767 --> 01:03:21.624
They met in university when such
things were possible...

01:03:21.709 --> 01:03:24.612
and then teaching at a
local school in Kabul.

01:03:26.475 --> 01:03:28.544
When the Taliban took control,

01:03:29.027 --> 01:03:30.886
she took their
school underground.

01:03:30.962 --> 01:03:33.389
My father decided to translate.

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:36.244
To help make things better.

01:03:38.534 --> 01:03:41.236
You?

01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:47.853
I became a teacher
like her, underground.

01:03:49.847 --> 01:03:53.183
Inside a square box you
put secret things into.

01:04:05.326 --> 01:04:08.162
He did not want to betray you.

01:04:08.218 --> 01:04:10.321
They came that
morning and took me.

01:04:10.393 --> 01:04:12.995
They were going to kill me.

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:15.965
Bartering death and betrayal

01:04:16.035 --> 01:04:19.038
are sometimes the only
things left here.

01:04:20.262 --> 01:04:23.199
Why did you rescue
me in the cabin?

01:04:24.097 --> 01:04:27.804
Once you were dead,
they would kill us.

01:04:28.008 --> 01:04:29.308
And dressing like a man?

01:04:32.642 --> 01:04:33.988
If I'm going to die,

01:04:34.074 --> 01:04:36.411
I want to know what it
is like to be free.

01:05:28.453 --> 01:05:29.855
Good morning.

01:05:40.412 --> 01:05:42.255
Say... "uncle"!

01:05:42.577 --> 01:05:44.316
Why?

01:05:44.393 --> 01:05:46.982
I can't explain it,
really, but...

01:05:47.074 --> 01:05:51.513
say,"Dylan is the most
handsome man in Afghanistan."

01:05:51.751 --> 01:05:52.579
Never!

01:05:52.664 --> 01:05:53.856
You think that's funny, eh?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.484
I think you're funny-looking!

01:05:56.825 --> 01:05:58.668
I'm the most
handsome Gwich'in man

01:05:58.756 --> 01:06:00.175
you ever laid eyes on, eh?

01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:03.210
You are the only Gwi... Gwa...

01:06:03.316 --> 01:06:04.258
Gwich'in.

01:06:04.345 --> 01:06:06.481
...man I have ever seen.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.038
Fair enough, JoJo.

01:06:09.093 --> 01:06:11.674
My name is not JoJo.

01:06:11.708 --> 01:06:12.675
You sure?

01:06:21.316 --> 01:06:23.251
We need to leave now.

01:06:23.408 --> 01:06:26.779
There will be patrols everywhere
on the main road.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:29.828
We will have to walk the
rest of the way.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.430
Khatira!

01:07:57.923 --> 01:07:59.820
They never let me give
her a proper burial.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.221
They just...

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:05.047
put her in a hole in
the ground somewhere.

01:08:05.503 --> 01:08:06.998
Sometimes I
imagine she is alive,

01:08:07.073 --> 01:08:09.909
living in another world.

01:08:12.498 --> 01:08:15.267
Look.

01:08:16.247 --> 01:08:19.819
The little black
book you carry...

01:08:19.969 --> 01:08:22.037
It was my cousin's.

01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:24.531
What was her name?

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.294
Asana. She was Inuit.

01:08:28.419 --> 01:08:29.879
Did you find love again?

01:08:29.912 --> 01:08:33.298
No.

01:08:33.372 --> 01:08:35.939
Well, you're young, and life is
too short to hold back.

01:08:36.318 --> 01:08:38.095
Me, it's like I'm still married.

01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:14.011
Hmm.

01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:15.904
These are her words?

01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:21.928
We were young...

01:09:22.755 --> 01:09:26.430
15... 14.

01:09:26.524 --> 01:09:29.136
In history class, we read
that there was an explorer

01:09:29.215 --> 01:09:31.112
that came to the North

01:09:31.277 --> 01:09:33.831
{\an8}and wrote that the Inuit have
10,000 words for snow.

01:09:35.251 --> 01:09:38.620
No, not really. But, um...

01:09:40.368 --> 01:09:43.272
that's what everyone
thought after he said it.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.732
She wanted to, uh,
document it in her own way.

01:09:54.812 --> 01:09:59.315
In her own words.

01:10:00.453 --> 01:10:05.392
Sometimes proving someone
wrong makes other things right.

01:10:16.673 --> 01:10:19.183
What's the translation?

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:20.467
"Frozen water vapor

01:10:20.547 --> 01:10:23.389
that falls to the ground in
soft white flakes."

01:10:40.425 --> 01:10:42.960
Now we're both spies, eh?

01:10:45.184 --> 01:10:48.453
Spies on our own land.

01:11:33.075 --> 01:11:35.710
What does "Gwich'in"
stand for?

01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.763
"The people."

01:11:39.615 --> 01:11:40.916
"Pashtun"?

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.940
"The mountain people."

01:11:44.324 --> 01:11:46.792
We're headed
in the right direction.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.582
Just over that mountain range.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.684
Pakistan.

01:14:06.932 --> 01:14:09.333
I'm tired.

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:38.991
Mornin'.

01:17:05.683 --> 01:17:08.378
We have to take a different
path than originally planned.

01:17:08.447 --> 01:17:10.001
There are Taliban
insurgents coming through...

01:17:10.064 --> 01:17:11.714
have been for three days.

01:17:11.815 --> 01:17:13.085
We've just been lucky.

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:15.730
We have to move.

01:17:35.546 --> 01:17:37.611
She keeps following me!

01:17:40.108 --> 01:17:42.009
Love is like that.

01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:06.872
This will work.

01:19:06.954 --> 01:19:08.822
We can rest here for the night.

01:19:08.904 --> 01:19:11.340
No one will be able to see us.

01:19:11.559 --> 01:19:12.520
Come.

01:19:12.602 --> 01:19:14.997
What if there are bears
in the back sleeping?

01:19:15.075 --> 01:19:15.741
No bears.

01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:17.032
Maybe a snow leopard.

01:19:17.398 --> 01:19:18.296
Really?

01:19:19.538 --> 01:19:21.725
All sorts of animals
come out in the night.

01:19:23.781 --> 01:19:26.884
We need to leave tomorrow
at daybreak.

01:19:28.499 --> 01:19:31.135
We should get some sleep.

01:19:49.982 --> 01:19:52.521
JoJo was afraid of wild dogs, too.

01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:03.353
That JoJo of yours...

01:20:03.472 --> 01:20:05.941
how old is he now?

01:20:11.786 --> 01:20:16.824
He... he's dead, isn't he?

01:20:17.085 --> 01:20:19.555
What did he die of?

01:20:25.776 --> 01:20:27.948
He, um...

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:30.098
he left himself.

01:20:31.388 --> 01:20:34.157
I don't know what you mean.

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:40.168
He killed himself.

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:49.329
My cousin Faris...

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:54.584
Uncle Ramiz's son,
was a suicide bomber.

01:20:54.696 --> 01:20:57.565
He died when he was nine.

01:20:59.625 --> 01:21:02.460
I'm sorry.

01:21:04.801 --> 01:21:08.470
Why did your cousin do it?

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:19.006
I think...

01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:22.551
I think he thought he
had nothing to live for.

01:21:33.751 --> 01:21:37.936
Do you think Faris and
JoJo are in paradise,

01:21:38.007 --> 01:21:39.836
or in hell?

01:21:39.869 --> 01:21:42.538
We don't believe in hell.

01:21:42.994 --> 01:21:46.141
JoJo is in the spirit
world with our ancestors.

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:50.647
They're here now,
looking after us.

01:21:52.594 --> 01:21:56.531
Why do you call me "JoJo"?

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:01.817
Because you remind me of him.

01:22:25.657 --> 01:22:27.282
JoJo and Tahir.

01:22:30.324 --> 01:22:32.625
Where I come from,

01:22:33.505 --> 01:22:38.161
if a name is passed down from
one person to another...

01:22:38.284 --> 01:22:40.819
you share more than a name.

01:22:41.008 --> 01:22:44.613
You share the
bones of that person.

01:22:44.771 --> 01:22:48.507
Will it make me stronger?

01:22:48.908 --> 01:22:51.710
Yes, Tahir.

01:22:53.595 --> 01:22:56.498
I'm still scared of the dogs.

01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:00.185
I know, Tahir.

01:23:00.282 --> 01:23:03.853
We're all scared of the dogs.

01:23:04.089 --> 01:23:06.424
We just can't let them know it.

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:52.702
I can make out
"Afghanistan" and "Pakistan."

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.371
What's the third one say?

01:23:58.104 --> 01:23:59.596
What?

01:23:59.694 --> 01:24:00.929
It says "Hell"...

01:24:01.333 --> 01:24:03.135
a joke, if it was funny.

01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:04.796
The path winds up
and around, meeting

01:24:04.868 --> 01:24:08.905
the trail to Pakistan, mostly
used by herders and tribesmen.

01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:10.986
That's reassuring.

01:24:11.064 --> 01:24:13.799
I thought you were some
big tribesman.

01:24:14.363 --> 01:24:16.397
Not a fuckin'
mountain goat, though.

01:24:19.522 --> 01:24:22.760
Not a lot of hills where
I come from.

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:25.925
We're almost there.

01:25:04.204 --> 01:25:06.540
Pakistan.

01:25:22.555 --> 01:25:24.355
Aman, stop!

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:30.011
Don't move.

01:25:31.289 --> 01:25:33.526
Don't move.

01:25:34.475 --> 01:25:35.975
You already said that.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:37.596
I know.

01:26:03.161 --> 01:26:05.662
Dylan...

01:26:06.356 --> 01:26:09.226
I want you to take them now.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.903
You need to promise me you
will look after my family.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.442
Promise me.

01:26:21.697 --> 01:26:24.503
You have my word.

01:26:24.644 --> 01:26:25.878
Stay still.

01:26:26.169 --> 01:26:28.024
Don't move!

01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:30.960
I'll be back for you.

01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:39.859
Khatira?

01:26:40.002 --> 01:26:41.789
Where are you?

01:26:41.883 --> 01:26:44.753
I think we are
to your right.

01:26:44.872 --> 01:26:46.006
Khatira?

01:26:46.142 --> 01:26:48.077
Is Tahir with you?

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:49.812
I don't know
where he is!

01:26:49.937 --> 01:26:51.113
Dylan!

01:26:51.505 --> 01:26:52.849
Tahir!

01:26:52.945 --> 01:26:53.873
Tahir!

01:26:53.961 --> 01:26:55.503
I'm over here!

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:59.055
Tahir!

01:26:59.286 --> 01:27:00.291
Tahir!

01:27:00.393 --> 01:27:01.891
Where are you?

01:27:02.053 --> 01:27:04.033
Khatira?

01:27:04.192 --> 01:27:05.357
I can't see you!

01:27:05.463 --> 01:27:07.007
Tahir!

01:27:07.122 --> 01:27:10.258
I can't see you!

01:30:10.849 --> 01:30:12.617
