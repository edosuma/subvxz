(STAMMERING) I don't even know
what you're talking about.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.266
Who's this platypus?
Why am I handcuffed to him?

10:00.266 --> 10:03.895
And where
is Perry the Platypus?

10:03.895 --> 10:06.606
So to recap, in order of importance,
why am I handcuffed to him?

10:06.648 --> 10:10.151
So it'll make it easier
to hunt the both of youse.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.152
Now, run!

10:11.152 --> 10:14.280
Okay, fair enough. (YELLS)

10:14.280 --> 10:16.282
Wow! You know, I really
shouldn't have ignored

10:16.282 --> 10:20.620
the 97% of customer feedback
that says he tends to go rogue.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.413
So, I guess we should
introduce ourselves.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.625
My name is
Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.627
Ancl you being a platypus, you can't
talk to tell me your... Uh...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.420
(STAMMERING) You know, I'm
just gonna call you Steven.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.757

You look like a Steven to me.

10:41.432 --> 10:45.270
Whoa! It was a trap?
I did not see that coming!

10:45.270 --> 10:47.647
All right, Nancy, don't
hold anything back, love.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.823
What took you so long?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.825
BU FORD: All right, you two, let's
get something straight here.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.577
There'll be no messing
with the Buford!

11:00.577 --> 11:02.954
Don't make no diff
how many of you there are.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.582
Buford, I would never mess with you.
Neither would I!

11:05.582 --> 11:07.292
That's good, 'cause I
still got your number.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.169
Or would that be numbers?
I don't know.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.713
Hey, Baljeet, which one would
be grammatically corre...

11:11.713 --> 11:13.339
Huh?

11:13.339 --> 11:15.216
How rude!

11:15.216 --> 11:16.801
Finally getting around to
spring cleaning in the summer.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.428
First up, the fridge.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.847
Ivlom! Look at this! Look
what Phineas and Ferb did!

11:20.847 --> 11:22.348
Hello,
Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.559
Oh, hello, Baljeet.
How's your mom doing?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.477
Oh, she is doing well.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.314
That's good. That's nice.
Would you like a snack?

11:29.314 --> 11:30.857
Something to drink
if you have it.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.734
Let's see, I've got some
grape juice or orange juice.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.860
I would like grape juice.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.697
And orange juice.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.241
Mom!
My, someone's thirsty!

11:40.241 --> 11:41.701
Oh, there's
more juice down here.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.330
Let's see. I've got pineapple,
mango, and tomato.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.873
BALJEET 3: Pineapple!
BAUEET 4: Mango!

11:46.873 --> 11:49.000
BAUEET 5: Tomato!
Okay, Baljeet.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.252
You weren't kidding.
You really were thirsty.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.629
Mom!

11:52.629 --> 11:54.714
(PANTING) I think we lost him.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.633
You can slow down now.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.260
I just said slow down,
I didn't say stop.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.012
What are you looking at? Oh, no,
you we are not going... (YELLS)

there, Steven! (GURGLING)

12:32.543 --> 12:35.296

That was sweet!

12:35.296 --> 12:37.548
You're really good at that...
That barb thing.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.551
What? Why are you turning around?
Oh, don't go back that way.

12:40.551 --> 12:44.764

Oh, I see, a waterfall. Just in time
for commercial. Isn't that convenient?

12:49.686 --> 12:53.564
What's that all about, anyway? It's not a
cliff-faller, it's called a cliffhanger.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.566
Ancl here we are, falling, and watch,
watch, watch, here we go. Wait.

hang on there, Steven!

13:12.292 --> 13:14.085
I'm tired of running.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.587
And I don't mean tired like I
need to sit down for a while.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.090
(STAMMERING) I mean, although lam tired
and I do need to sit down after all,

13:19.090 --> 13:21.092
but I mean
I'm fed up with that guy.

13:21.092 --> 13:24.095
With your animal instincts and
my vast knowledge of science,

13:24.095 --> 13:25.596

I wonder if the others
would like some juice.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.842
We should take some
out to them.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.010
What about Buford?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.386
Indeed. What about Buford?

14:05.386 --> 14:06.095
What has he
ever done for us?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.639
You mean, to us.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.974
Yeah, he can get
his own juice.

having a party, Baljeet?

14:13.644 --> 14:17.398

Wait a moment.

Well, all right, then.
Carry on.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.491
So, we all agree.
No juice for Buford.

he is our friend.

(WITHOUT AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) But
it's not my fault! It's him!

20:49.874 --> 20:51.459
It's the platypus you want!

20:51.459 --> 20:53.461
Oh, look how cute he is!

20:53.461 --> 20:54.754
Whoa!

20:54.754 --> 20:57.381
What a handsome platypus!

20:57.381 --> 20:59.383
MONOGRAM: There has
got to be a way out of here.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.385
CARL: Major Monogram?
MONOGRAM: Yes, Carl?

21:01.385 --> 21:03.471
CARL: (STAMMERING) I want you
to meet my cousin, Larry.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.097
MONOGRAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got out of the vent,

21:05.097 --> 21:07.850
found your cousin
and brought him back in here?

21:07.850 --> 21:09.393
CARL: Well, I didn't have to find him.
We had a lunch date.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.271
He was waiting for me...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.231
MONOGRAM: Why on Earth would did
you bring him back into the vent?

21:14.231 --> 21:16.275
CARL: 'Cause
I wanted you to meet him.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.985
LARRY: Plus,
I really like vents.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.278
MONOGRAM: Mutual, I'm sure.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.863
How are you
feeling, buddy?

21:20.863 --> 21:22.490
Oddly enough, I feel the same.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.033
But I am not worried
about making choices anymore.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.410
Well, it's nice
to have you back, Baljeet.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.038
I agree. It's nice to have you back.
One of you back.

21:29.038 --> 21:34.877
Buford, do I detect
true sentiment in your voice?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.129
You do realize
I'm holding a pie here.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.298
I retract my mocking tone.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
Perry the Platypus!
Oh, this is perfect!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.802
I want you to meet my new
friend, Steven the Platypus.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.930
You guys...
Huh? He's gone!

21:45.930 --> 21:49.934
I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.061
(GASPS) Steven! We were
just talking about you!

21:52.061 --> 21:54.897
Hey, I'd like you
to meet Per...

21:54.897 --> 21:56.524
Now where did he go?

21:56.524 --> 21:59.944
Aw, I really wanted you to meet him.
Hey, maybe you know him!

21:59.944 --> 22:02.321
It's not that I think platypuses
all know each other or anything,

22:02.321 --> 22:04.406
it's just that I thought that
maybe you might, you know,

22:04.406 --> 22:06.075
run in the same crowd
or something.
