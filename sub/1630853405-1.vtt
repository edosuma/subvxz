00:02.066 --> 00:02.500
This program is rated G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.333
Megan Miller.

00:38.467 --> 00:40.333
Are you in Denver?

00:40.467 --> 00:41.767
Megan: Oh, hello, Mrs. Evans.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.367
Not for three more days.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.767
Megan: Yes, I'm in Denver.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.900
On my way to
the client as we speak,

00:48.033 --> 00:50.033
but I'm so excited
about tonight.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.333
Me too.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.200
Is Mom? Is she staying sane?

00:53.333 --> 00:55.700
Well, she volunteered
to coordinate corsages

00:55.834 --> 00:57.367
for the wedding party. So...

00:57.500 --> 00:59.433
How hard could that be?
Thank you.

00:59.567 --> 01:01.567
Do you know how many flowers
are in bloom right now?

01:01.700 --> 01:03.400
I mean, she's obsessing.

01:03.533 --> 01:05.967
She just wants
everything to be perfect.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.834
Yeah. I do, too.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.433
Megan: And it will
be better than perfect.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.900
It will be real
and full of heart.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.133
Just like the bride.

01:13.266 --> 01:17.233
I'm marrying Jack.

01:17.367 --> 01:18.900
I still can't quite believe it.

01:19.033 --> 01:20.834
I know he is
one heck of a catch.

01:20.967 --> 01:23.500
After all, he is
the luckiest guy in the world.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.300
Yeah, he kind of is.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.233
Alright. Showtime. I gotta buzz.

01:28.367 --> 01:29.467
I'll see you at 7:00.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.066
Okay, but don't be late.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.300
Megan: Neither snow
nor rain nor gloom of the night

01:33.433 --> 01:35.400
will keep this
maid of honor from being at

01:35.533 --> 01:36.967
her sister's bachelorette party.

01:37.100 --> 01:39.000
I'll see you later.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.934
Mom: Blair! Blair!
We've had a breakthrough!

01:42.066 --> 01:44.934
Uh, I'll be down in a few, Mom.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.300
May I help you?

02:04.433 --> 02:06.567
Hi, I'm Megan Miller.
I have a 10:00 o'clock

02:06.700 --> 02:08.533
appointment with Mrs. O'Reilly.
Fun For All.

02:08.667 --> 02:09.834
She's still with
her 9:00 o'clock,

02:09.967 --> 02:11.233
but it shouldn't be too long.

02:11.367 --> 02:12.500
Would you like a water?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.734
Um, no, that's okay. Thanks.

02:17.767 --> 02:20.166
Okay. I'll just go--
I'll sit over there. Thanks.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.166
For the bridesmaids I was
thinking roses or carnations,

02:39.300 --> 02:41.633
because, I mean, naturally
that's what you do, right?

02:41.767 --> 02:43.633
But then I thought,
where's the fun in that?

02:43.767 --> 02:46.500
If we keep to a color scheme,

02:46.633 --> 02:49.300
we could do a parade
of different flowers.

02:49.433 --> 02:52.467
Roses, carnations,
daisies, lisianthis,

02:52.600 --> 02:55.667
whatever all nestled
in baby's breath.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.033
I mean you can never go wrong
with baby's breath, right?

02:58.166 --> 02:59.967
Uh, yeah.

03:00.166 --> 03:04.433
The eye will be drawn in
and pow, the dresses will pop.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.033
Whatever you want mom.

03:06.166 --> 03:08.567
No, it's whatever you want.
It's your day.

03:08.700 --> 03:09.967
Well, I want you to pick,

03:10.100 --> 03:11.767
because whatever
you choose will be amazing.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.033
Hi, Mrs. M.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.033
Hi, Della.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.033
Oh! Sorry.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.533
- Is it 10:30 already?
- Just about.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.133
We'll see how the flowers
look on the girls.

03:21.266 --> 03:22.400
Okay. Want to bring them up?

03:22.533 --> 03:23.900
Okay.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.900
Excuse me.

03:37.033 --> 03:38.934
Did Mrs. O'Riley mention
how much longer she's gonna be?

03:39.066 --> 03:40.700
I'm sorry. No.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.734
Oh. Well, that 9:00
must be going real well.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.200
Probably just got
Ms. O'Riley talking.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.600
When she starts
she could go all day.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.300
Well, that's good to know. Thanks.

03:51.433 --> 03:53.233
Do you have another
appointment to get to?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.734
Nope.
This is my only stop in Denver.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.266
I just--

03:57.400 --> 04:00.200
I have a flight to
catch this afternoon.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.900
Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.667
Sure I can't get you a water?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.066
You know what?
I will get that water.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.500
Mom!

04:21.633 --> 04:22.800
I love the colors.

04:22.934 --> 04:24.800
Yeah, it turned out great.

04:24.934 --> 04:29.133
Yes! Like I said, amazing.

04:29.266 --> 04:30.633
Yeah.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.734
Oh.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.700
I never did get
the hang of these.

04:38.834 --> 04:40.100
You look fabulous.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.333
Man:

04:53.467 --> 04:54.967
You know,
I hear it's a beautiful stadium.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.834
Mrs. O'Riley:
It is! It's a real gem.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.834
Next time I'm in town I'll have
to try and catch a game.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.533
Let me know.
We have excellent box seats.

05:03.667 --> 05:04.934
I'll set you up.

05:06.633 --> 05:07.734
That'd be amazing.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.066
Alden Brown.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.400
Megan Miller?

05:12.533 --> 05:14.367
Both: What are you doing here?

05:14.500 --> 05:16.233
Novelties R Us?

05:16.367 --> 05:18.100
Fun For All?

05:18.233 --> 05:19.867
You must be my 10:00 o'clock.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.667
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.000
Novelties R Us is your company.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.500
And Fun For All is yours.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.233
Thank you for stopping in, Alden.

05:29.367 --> 05:30.500
We'll be in touch.

05:30.633 --> 05:32.266
Yes, and if you
have any questions,

05:32.400 --> 05:34.100
just give me a call
or shoot me an email.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.533
Of course.

05:36.667 --> 05:41.066
I have kept you waiting
long enough, Miss...

05:41.200 --> 05:42.333
Megan is totally fine.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.600
Oh, I'm Leanne.

05:43.734 --> 05:44.867
Nice to meet you.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.266
So, you and Alden
know each other?

05:47.400 --> 05:48.600
Yeah, we grew up together.

05:48.734 --> 05:50.266
We went to rival high schools.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.867
Oh! Small world.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.967
Yeah, sure is. Too small.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.300
That's adorable.

06:11.433 --> 06:13.467
Yeah, and as you can see
from our promotional materials,

06:13.600 --> 06:17.767
we have a dynamic product line
with a ton of variety.

06:17.900 --> 06:22.633
I gotta admit, the hand-sewn
whoopee cushion made me smile,

06:22.767 --> 06:24.400
but these guys--

06:24.533 --> 06:27.500
The perfect poster toy for
what Fun For All is all about.

06:27.633 --> 06:30.000
See all our toys are
traditional mechanics.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.333
So, no electronics.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.967
Oh, my kids would love these.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.400
And our packaging doubles as
eye-catching store displays.

06:36.533 --> 06:40.734
So, the entire product line
is really going to stand out

06:40.867 --> 06:42.066
in your department stores.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.934
If we decide to
carry vintage toys.

06:45.066 --> 06:46.500
No, you must.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.500
People nowadays,
especially children,

06:48.633 --> 06:50.233
they're turning off technology.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.233
They're oversaturated.

06:52.367 --> 06:56.433
The market for old-fashioned
toys is exploding.

06:56.567 --> 07:00.233
Well, it must be if two sharp
Millennials like you and Alden

07:00.367 --> 07:03.000
have started
competing companies.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.033
Competition in name only.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.400
My product line is the best.

07:07.533 --> 07:10.867
You're really passionate
about what you do.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.467
Yeah.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.934
Fun For All has been
a dream of mine since...

07:16.633 --> 07:18.033
Since I can remember.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.633
I like that.

07:19.767 --> 07:23.734
But the thing is, Megan,
Mountain State Consolidated

07:23.867 --> 07:27.166
has gotten to where it is,
the largest most profitable

07:27.300 --> 07:30.066
chain of family-owned
department stores in the region,

07:30.200 --> 07:33.900
because we always
expand prudently.

07:34.033 --> 07:36.567
Respecting verities.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.967
That's what Fun For All
is all about.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.000
Let me walk you through
the Mountain State story.

07:42.133 --> 07:44.800
Show you how we got here.

07:44.934 --> 07:49.066
Well, it all started with
Great Grandpa O'Riley,

07:49.200 --> 07:52.033
a man of vision.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.200
In the spring of 1890,

07:54.333 --> 07:57.000
he stowed away in
the hold of a freighter.

07:57.133 --> 08:00.600
Blair, you will never guess who
I just ran into! Alden brown!

08:00.734 --> 08:03.233
The guy from Central High?

08:03.367 --> 08:04.467
Megan: Yes!

08:04.600 --> 08:05.734
You saw him where?

08:05.867 --> 08:07.533
We were pitching
to the same client.

08:07.667 --> 08:11.200
Apparently, he has his own
vintage toy business.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.133
Wow. What are the chances?

08:13.266 --> 08:15.367
I wish I had a trigger warning.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.767
Seeing him brought back so many
high school horror stories.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.033
Blair: Yeah. I bet.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.567
Debates, the pep club showdowns.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.300
We competed then
and we're competing now,

08:22.433 --> 08:25.867
but this time
he is not going to win.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.600
You go, girl.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.734
I am on my way to the airport.

08:29.867 --> 08:31.066
I will see you soon.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.734
Megan, you did
remember to bring--

08:32.867 --> 08:34.533
That super something
special borrowed to go with

08:34.667 --> 08:36.200
your old, new, and blue?

08:36.333 --> 08:37.633
Uh-huh. Of course, I did.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.100
Why did I even ask?

08:42.700 --> 08:43.567
Oh, no.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.734
What?

08:44.867 --> 08:47.400
The Denver Airport is closed.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.600
What? Why?

08:49.734 --> 08:52.533
Wildcat baggage handler strike?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.467
You're still coming tonight,
right?

09:00.734 --> 09:02.100
Got to go. Bye.

09:04.967 --> 09:06.533
It's a regional strike.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.100
So, Colorado Springs
is still open.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.867
There's a flight leaving to
Wichita in about three hours.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.367
So, I was thinking
that I could rent a car...

09:16.667 --> 09:19.166
To...

09:19.300 --> 09:21.367
Blair, I'm going to
call you back. Bye.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.533
Excuse me.

09:29.667 --> 09:32.367
I really need to rent
a car like five minutes ago.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.667
Oh, okay.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.033
I'll ask all the other
people in line to step aside

09:37.166 --> 09:38.667
so you can go first.

09:38.800 --> 09:43.266
Really? Oh, thank you so much.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.266
Yeah, everybody needs to run
a car like 10 minutes ago.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.667
Um...

09:48.800 --> 09:50.200
The thing is, it's an emergency.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.166
It's not like I'm having a baby
or a heart attack

09:52.300 --> 09:53.867
or I need a car
to save the world,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.934
but my sister is getting married
and her bachelorette party

09:56.066 --> 09:57.667
is tonight.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.533
Wow, a bachelorette party.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.800
That does sound important.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.333
Yeah. No, it's not.

10:05.467 --> 10:06.767
I'm really sorry, Stella.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.266
You must be having
a really stressful day

10:08.400 --> 10:10.333
and I'm being a total jerk.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.233
It's just
I'm the maid of honor and...

10:14.000 --> 10:16.700
I'm hosting the party,
and it's for my little sister,

10:16.834 --> 10:17.967
and I've always
been there for her

10:18.100 --> 10:19.467
and I never let her down and...

10:20.767 --> 10:22.000
...the thought of me
letting her down

10:22.133 --> 10:24.233
and not being there for her,
it just...

10:25.633 --> 10:26.767
I'm sorry.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.467
Sorry, Stella.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.867
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Have a nice day.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.300
Me?

10:34.433 --> 10:37.166
I would do anything
for my little sister

10:37.300 --> 10:38.867
Anything.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.967
Follow me.

10:52.633 --> 10:54.033
Megan, hey! Did you get a car!?

10:54.166 --> 10:55.700
- Can't talk, Alden.
- Where are you headed?

10:55.834 --> 10:57.266
Colorado Springs, I'm catching
a flight to Wichita.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.533
Wichita?

10:59.667 --> 11:00.867
I need to get the Wichita.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.333
Well, good luck with that.

11:02.467 --> 11:03.567
Let me come with you.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.100
No, thank you.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.500
I'll pay for gas,
I'll pay for the rental fee.

11:07.633 --> 11:11.200
I will buy you
a first class upgrade.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.734
Are you pleading with me?

11:12.867 --> 11:14.000
Begging.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.934
Megan, please.
It's an emergency.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.934
An emergency? Are you having
a baby? A heart attack?

11:18.066 --> 11:19.533
Have you been tasked
to save the world?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.233
It's my dad.

11:21.367 --> 11:23.667
It's his retirement party.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.900
The entire family's
going to be there.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.433
Everyone's flying in.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.500
I've never missed
a really important family event,

11:28.633 --> 11:31.600
and I've never not been
there for my dad, not ever.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.200
How can I say no to that?

11:36.333 --> 11:37.967
Let me grab my stuff.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.367
Well-played.

11:44.233 --> 11:46.133
I call shotgun.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.734
Alden: Hey, I noticed
you don't have a suitcase.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.100
Yeah, I checked it
through to Wichita

11:58.233 --> 12:00.800
when I left from
Seattle this morning.

12:00.934 --> 12:04.166
Wait, you live In Seattle, too?

12:04.300 --> 12:06.266
This day keeps on
getting better and better.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.333
I live in Belltown.
Where do you live?

12:09.467 --> 12:10.700
That's great. We're neighbors.

12:12.734 --> 12:14.967
I'm feeling a bit of
a chill over here, Megatron.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.900
Don't call me that.
My friends only call me that

12:17.033 --> 12:18.433
and you are definitely
not one of them.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.800
Well, high school was ages ago.

12:19.934 --> 12:22.367
So, maybe we could
be friends now.

12:24.066 --> 12:25.934
Not until you give me
that trophy stole for me back.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.233
What trophy?

12:27.367 --> 12:29.400
Regional debate champ.
Senior year.

12:29.533 --> 12:30.900
Uh, I won that fair and square.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.700
Oh, no, you did not.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.433
Alden: Oh, no.

12:35.567 --> 12:37.934
Well, I guess we're not the only
ones with a bright idea.

12:38.066 --> 12:40.767
Colorado Springs to Wichita,
sold out.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.500
I guess you're going
to be flying without me.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.734
What?

12:45.867 --> 12:48.266
I never got a flight.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.400
I thought I could just buy
a plane ticket at the airport.

12:52.533 --> 12:53.633
Oh.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.400
It's okay. It's totally okay.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.633
When's the next flight?

12:57.767 --> 13:00.066
Not until tomorrow.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.567
Okay. What are we gonna do?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.200
Go back to Denver?

13:05.333 --> 13:07.033
Maybe there's a bus
that'll take us to Wichita.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.667
No, that's going
to take forever.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.567
- Why don't we just drive there?
- Let's just drive there.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.133
- Can't be that far.
- 78 hours tops.

13:17.266 --> 13:18.367
We'd be there by midnight.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.834
I'll miss
the bachelorette party.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.066
And my dad's barbecue
isn't until Sunday.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.533
But I'll make it
in time for the wedding.

13:22.667 --> 13:23.800
Cousins, I can hang out
with them on Saturday.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.233
And the rehearsal dinner.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.667
Seven to eight hours in the car.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.066
Together.

13:34.967 --> 13:36.400
For my sister.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.400
For my dad.

13:41.333 --> 13:42.567
I still want that trophy.

13:43.967 --> 13:45.166
I'm not even sure
if I still have it.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.467
Yes, you are and yes, you do.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.066
Top shelf in the family room,

13:48.200 --> 13:50.166
right next to my
Student of the Year award.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.600
That's gonna look
so perfect next to mine.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.200
Blair: Oh, no!

14:02.333 --> 14:03.934
Megan: I know, I'm so bummed.

14:04.066 --> 14:06.633
There's no way at all
that you can get here on time?

14:06.767 --> 14:10.600
No, and I wrote
a killer toast, too.

14:10.734 --> 14:13.567
Why don't you email it to me?
I'll read it to everyone.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.266
No, you can't read it!
It has to be read to you.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.767
You'll see. I know!

14:18.900 --> 14:21.300
Okay. Why don't you
call me back when it's time

14:21.433 --> 14:23.433
and I'll read the toast
over the phone?

14:23.567 --> 14:25.400
Perfect. Hey, I gotta jump off.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.533
Jack's here, but keep me
posted on your progress.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.633
- Megan: I will.
- Bye.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.200
Hi, handsome.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.133
Sorry. I only let
my fiance call me that.

14:35.266 --> 14:36.533
What brings you here?

14:36.667 --> 14:37.767
Baby's breath.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.266
For your mom.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
Ah, yes, the wedding party look.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.400
we have a ton of
baby's breath in our garden.

14:44.533 --> 14:45.700
It's over-flowering with it.

14:46.867 --> 14:49.033
Jack.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.800
So, Megan's not going to be able
to make the bachelorette party.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.633
- Why not?
- She can't get a flight.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.767
She's driving in
from Denver instead.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.266
I thought she was
hosting the party.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.200
I'll enlist Della to do it.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.834
Ah, you'll Della-gate her.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.834
Three more days, Jack,
and then that's it.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.834
No more puns. You promised.

15:05.967 --> 15:08.500
I know. I'm just trying
to get it out of my system

15:08.633 --> 15:10.633
so we can enjoy
our pun-free-moon.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.934
You know, you get better mileage
if you use cruise control.

15:23.066 --> 15:24.367
I'm not really worried
about the mileage.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.734
You're paying for the gas.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.834
Okay if I put the radio on?

15:32.967 --> 15:35.133
No, no music.
I find it very distracting.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.700
How about talk radio?

15:38.834 --> 15:39.967
No.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.800
Podcast?

15:41.934 --> 15:44.200
No. Why don't you just listen
to something on your phone?

15:44.333 --> 15:46.533
I can't, earbuds in a moving
vehicle making me nauseous.

15:46.667 --> 15:47.867
Okay, then read something.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.400
That's even worse.

15:53.233 --> 15:54.700
Why don't we play a game?

15:54.834 --> 15:55.700
20 Questions?

15:55.834 --> 15:57.166
No, thank you.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.166
- Alphabet.
- You'd cheat.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.500
I would not cheat.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.900
A leopard cannot
change his stripes.

16:03.033 --> 16:04.533
Spots.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.333
Whatever.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.066
This is about that debate,
isn't it?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.367
For starters.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.100
You actually think
that I cheated.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.367
No, I know that you did.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.734
Really? How?

16:14.867 --> 16:17.233
Resolved cafeteria food
fails to meet RDA guidelines?

16:17.367 --> 16:21.066
You presented totally
bogus data to show that it does.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.934
And were you able to
prove that the data was--

16:23.066 --> 16:25.367
- Data were.
- Bogus in rebuttal?

16:27.667 --> 16:30.333
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.333
I was having internet problems.

16:32.467 --> 16:33.834
I didn't have
time to research it.

16:33.967 --> 16:36.100
Ah, see, I was in
the same auditorium

16:36.233 --> 16:38.567
using the same internet
and funny, I didn't have any

16:38.700 --> 16:40.000
trouble rebutting your claims.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.500
Oh, yeah, with bogus data.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.767
Robert's Rules of Order
clearly state

16:44.900 --> 16:46.533
that it is the burden
of the rebutter--

16:46.667 --> 16:48.834
I do know! I know, I know,
I know the rules.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.700
Case closed. Case closed.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.000
Cheater.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.667
Sore loser.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.600
Well, you're going to be
a sore loser this time around,

17:04.734 --> 17:08.233
because that Consolidated
account is mine.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.266
You haven't seen
my product line.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.767
Oh, I have, I always
research the competition.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.300
Really? Well, so have I.

17:16.433 --> 17:17.333
I've seen your stuff.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.400
I know and it rocks.

17:18.533 --> 17:20.567
It's not bad.

17:23.633 --> 17:26.633
You are going to hate
the taste of my dust.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.934
We'll see about that.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.100
Of course, if you want to give
me a hard time about that debate

17:41.233 --> 17:42.433
I could say the same thing about

17:42.567 --> 17:44.767
the school spirit
film competition.

17:44.900 --> 17:48.300
Oh, give me a break, that movie,
if you can even call it that,

17:48.433 --> 17:50.433
was totally amateurish.

17:50.567 --> 17:53.233
As it should be in
a film made by amateurs.

17:53.367 --> 17:54.467
And what is your point?

17:54.600 --> 17:55.900
Charles Garvey.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.667
Charles? Okay.
What about Charles?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.500
Award-winning documentarian.

17:59.633 --> 18:02.400
Oh, and the father of your
classmate Toby Garvey.

18:02.533 --> 18:03.967
The director of your film.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.066
Who clearly inherited
his father's talents.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.734
Not to mention his
state-of-the-art camera,

18:08.867 --> 18:11.734
sound, and lighting equipment,
and his participation.

18:11.867 --> 18:14.066
He was only a consultant
on the movie.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.834
- Like ducks.
- "Like ducks."

18:15.967 --> 18:18.400
Who says like ducks?

18:18.533 --> 18:19.467
But I'm not going to give
you a hard time about it.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.700
You know why?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.500
No, but I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.467
Because it was a competition
and people compete to win.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.400
You have a genius
for stating the obvious.

18:28.533 --> 18:30.400
Come to think of it.
I may have been the best thing

18:30.533 --> 18:32.166
that ever happened
to you in high school.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.066
I gave you someone
to compete against.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.934
But like you said, we're not
in high school anymore.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.000
Yet here we are,
still competing.

18:43.967 --> 18:47.533
"Best thing to happen
to me in high school?"

18:47.667 --> 18:48.967
I know you are annoying,

18:49.100 --> 18:50.834
but I did not think
you were delusional.

18:50.967 --> 18:53.000
You know I'm right.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.133
What?

18:55.266 --> 18:57.333
Where's the car?

18:59.533 --> 19:00.900
Did we park it somewhere else?

19:01.033 --> 19:02.400
No, no. We parked
in front of the window

19:02.533 --> 19:04.066
with the caramel corn sign.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.633
That's why I bought some.
It was smart ad placement.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.367
Someone stole our car?

19:09.500 --> 19:12.400
- My luggage is in there!
- My sample suitcase, my phone!

19:12.533 --> 19:13.734
My something borrowed.

19:20.467 --> 19:23.200
Megan: I really appreciate
all your help with this all.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.900
Are you sure there's
nothing else I can do?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.567
Thanks.

19:30.834 --> 19:31.967
What did he say?

19:32.100 --> 19:34.333
Well, he issued an APB.

19:34.467 --> 19:35.567
Well, if they're tracking
your cell, we'll find

19:35.700 --> 19:38.133
my phone, though, right?

19:38.266 --> 19:40.200
You didn't
activate that feature?

19:40.333 --> 19:41.633
I don't like that thing.
I don't like that someone

19:41.767 --> 19:43.367
can track me down.
I find it very creepy,

19:43.500 --> 19:44.900
Besides, it doesn't matter
if they don't find the phone.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.533
I'm not the owner of it.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.400
They have to send it
back to the car rental place,

19:48.533 --> 19:51.300
which can't send us a new one,
because the airport strike,

19:51.433 --> 19:53.066
they're all booked up.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.133
Mm-hm. Well, I contacted Uber
and Lyft and every ride company

19:56.266 --> 19:58.367
that you've never heard of.
No one is going to take us

19:58.500 --> 20:00.700
because they all need
a fair back to Wichita,

20:00.834 --> 20:02.467
which I guess makes sense.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.834
Making sense does not
get us to Wichita.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.800
No, but I have
something that does.

20:23.133 --> 20:25.233
He wanted $5,000 for it,
but I sweet-talked him down to

20:25.367 --> 20:27.834
four and a half,
and a free tank of gas.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.800
You bought this?

20:33.934 --> 20:35.900
Yeah, put it on my card.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.600
Well, how do you
even know it runs?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.967
That's really reassuring,
like everything printed

20:45.100 --> 20:46.200
on a dot matrix is.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.700
Okay, have a little faith,
alright?

20:47.834 --> 20:50.066
The guy's in mechanic,
said the engines cherry.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.834
Wow, if I had known
that you were this gullible

20:52.967 --> 20:55.967
in high school,
I would have never lost to you.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.533
If you got a better idea
on how to get us to Wichita,

20:58.667 --> 21:00.200
I'd love to hear it.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.567
Must be your sister.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.800
Blair, hi.

21:11.934 --> 21:13.734
Hey, I just got your message.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.734
The car was stolen?

21:15.867 --> 21:18.533
Yeah, I know,
but we landed another one.

21:18.667 --> 21:19.900
Blair: Oh, good.

21:20.033 --> 21:21.200
Okay, I need to call
back on this phone

21:21.333 --> 21:22.800
when it's time
for the toast, okay?

21:22.934 --> 21:24.233
And whose phone is this?

21:28.533 --> 21:29.767
Alden Brown.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.100
What?

21:31.233 --> 21:32.934
I know. I know.

21:33.066 --> 21:34.533
I'll tell you about it
when I see you next, okay?

21:34.667 --> 21:35.867
I'll talk to you later.

21:38.266 --> 21:40.433
Alright, let's get this
dog and pony show on the road.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.400
Oh, that door doesn't open.

21:42.533 --> 21:43.800
Gotta use the driver door.

21:50.066 --> 21:53.767

Yeah. What is that about anyway?

22:30.467 --> 22:32.000
It's tradition.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.467
The bride. She always
wears something old,

22:33.600 --> 22:34.700
something new, something...

22:34.834 --> 22:36.133
Something borrowed,
something blue.

22:36.266 --> 22:37.367
- Yeah.
- Got it.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.767
So, Blair's something borrowed

22:38.900 --> 22:40.367
she was borrowing from me.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.467
It was this beautiful
vintage shawl I found at

22:42.600 --> 22:45.300
a Good Will in high school,
and I actually wore it--

22:45.433 --> 22:46.800
To senior prom.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.500
How do you know that?

22:49.633 --> 22:51.133
I was there, remember?
The time I was dating--

22:51.266 --> 22:53.500
Katie MacDougall, I remember.
Yeah, right.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.367
It was a beautiful shawl.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.100
Guys aren't supposed
to notice stuff like that.

23:00.233 --> 23:02.233
Well, I did.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.867
Well, Blair,
she thought it was beautiful too

23:05.000 --> 23:07.433
and she designed her whole
wedding dress around it,

23:07.567 --> 23:08.700
but now it's gone.

23:08.834 --> 23:10.266
I had it in my sample suitcase.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.600
You know, in case
the airlines lost my luggage.

23:13.734 --> 23:15.934
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

23:16.066 --> 23:20.266
I'm just turning out to be
the worst maid of honor ever.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.800
Your sister won't mind.

23:23.133 --> 23:24.500
Yeah, but I do.

23:31.834 --> 23:33.100
You know,
I remember your sister.

23:33.233 --> 23:35.700
She was one heck
of a cheerleader.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.934
Yeah, she is. Allstate.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.700
Who's she marrying?
Anybody I know?

23:41.834 --> 23:43.266
Jack Evans. He went to Central.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.700
She's marrying Greenback Jack?

23:44.834 --> 23:46.166
Oh, yeah. She is.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.767
That guy was money in the bank.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.567
Letter for every sports team.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.066
The Debate Club
even looked up to him.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.333
What's he doing now?

23:53.467 --> 23:54.734
He is teaching at a high school.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.000
That's how he and Blair met.

23:56.133 --> 23:57.233
They're both teachers together.

23:57.367 --> 23:58.600
Oh, P.E.?

23:58.734 --> 24:00.166
Special Ed.

24:00.300 --> 24:03.567
Right. Of course,
not just a great athlete.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.767
Great guy.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.633
And he was very picky.

24:07.767 --> 24:10.600
Your sister must
really be something.

24:10.734 --> 24:12.233
Yeah, she is.

24:18.433 --> 24:20.133
He did pun non-stop though.

24:20.266 --> 24:23.233
Oh, I know. I know, she's trying
to wean him off of that,

24:23.367 --> 24:26.467
but I think she might have
to state an intervention.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.500
- Good luck.
- Uh-oh.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.233
There's road work ahead,
but it says we're still

24:30.367 --> 24:32.266
on the fastest route,
but we won't be

24:32.400 --> 24:33.934
if the traffic backs up.

24:34.066 --> 24:35.800
Let's just take this exit here.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.667
No, I think we should
stick with the GPS.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.767
No, as soon as we turn off
it's going to recalculate,

24:39.900 --> 24:42.834
and I don't want to
get in a traffic jam.

24:42.967 --> 24:45.133
This exit.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.500
Alright.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.233
I mean,
a bachelorette pep rally?

25:02.367 --> 25:03.700
Who's idea was that?

25:03.834 --> 25:05.834
Megan.
She put all this together,

25:05.967 --> 25:07.066
with a little help from me.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.500
It seems like a lot of help.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.734
Well, she wasn't here. I was.

25:10.867 --> 25:12.400
Well, she should
be calling soon.

25:12.533 --> 25:14.834
So, I can't wait.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.300
It's not recalculating.

25:26.433 --> 25:27.700
Try a different app.

25:27.834 --> 25:29.734
I did, but I'm going
to try another one.

25:29.867 --> 25:31.233
So, we have no idea
where we are.

25:31.367 --> 25:33.467
- We're fine, Alden.
- No, we're not fine.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.533
- We're lost.
- Don't overreact. Okay?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.834
Look, maybe this app right here.

25:37.967 --> 25:40.367
No nothing. Uh-oh. Okay.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.734
I knew I should have
never let you convince me

25:41.867 --> 25:43.367
to get off the highway.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.633
Since when have I ever talked
you into doing anything?

25:44.767 --> 25:46.233
I knew it was a bad idea.

25:46.367 --> 25:48.500
How was I supposed to know
there'd be a dead zone?

25:48.633 --> 25:50.367
It said we were on
the fastest route.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.033
Well, sometimes GPS, they lie.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.133
Yeah, and sometimes
they don't work!

25:58.767 --> 26:00.233
Are you okay? Are you alright?

26:00.367 --> 26:02.166
Yeah, I'm fine.
It just came out of nowhere.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.033
You sure?

26:06.166 --> 26:07.533
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:22.367 --> 26:23.266
Oh, no.

26:27.767 --> 26:29.066
Come on!

26:42.567 --> 26:45.500
Well, at least
we have our signal back.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.967
Is AAA on the way?

26:48.100 --> 26:49.500
Looks like it.

26:49.633 --> 26:50.767
How much longer?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.166
it's hard to say,

26:52.300 --> 26:53.633
and I'm going to
shut my phone off soon.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.266
It's practically dead.
Too much hopping around

26:55.400 --> 26:56.600
to find a decent GPS.

26:56.734 --> 26:58.000
Alden, I said, I was sorry,

26:58.133 --> 26:59.967
and, no, you cannot
turn that thing off,

27:00.166 --> 27:01.734

call in my toast.

Well, whatever you are
they've had a heck of a day.

31:52.333 --> 31:55.066
Charlie told me all about it
when he called, you poor things.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.266
So listen, I got you some
pajamas and warm socks.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.500
Charlie said that you and he
were about the same size.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.467
Well, give or take a few inches.

Okay.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.934
Well, come on.
Let's get you settled.

32:46.066 --> 32:47.166
We're sleeping in a tent.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.667
A tent? This is a real beauty.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.266
Overflow from
the Renaissance Fair.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.000
It's got plenty of room,
you'll see.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.767

32:58.433 --> 32:59.967
a crafting studio,

33:00.166 --> 33:02.934
and I'm using Seth's
to store my LPs.

33:03.066 --> 33:05.533
Vinyl's made a comeback.

33:05.667 --> 33:06.900
Come on.
Let's get this puppy up.

33:07.033 --> 33:09.266
Okay.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.066
I've never put
a tent together before.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.333
Megan: It's easy.

33:12.467 --> 33:13.867
How do you know?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.600
Girl scouts. Ambassador gold.

33:16.734 --> 33:17.934
Impressive.

33:18.066 --> 33:19.867
No idea what that means.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.867
It's scouting highest honor.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.166
I don't want to brag.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.433
Well, that'd be a first.

33:24.567 --> 33:27.867
Hey, Alden, grab a corner.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.567
Yeah.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.834
Morning, sweetheart.

34:05.967 --> 34:07.200
Morning, Mom.

34:07.333 --> 34:08.900
Oh, what time did Megan
get in last night?

34:09.033 --> 34:10.166
I didn't hear come in.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.033
She didn't. Car trouble.

34:12.166 --> 34:13.533
Oh, no.

34:13.667 --> 34:16.834
They spent the night in
a town called Mackenzie.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.467
Where's that?

34:18.600 --> 34:21.400
According to GPS,
the middle of nowhere.

34:21.533 --> 34:23.000
What kind of car trouble?

34:23.133 --> 34:24.467
I don't know,

34:24.600 --> 34:26.867
but the mechanic said it
would be easy to fix.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.734
So, she'll be here in time
for the rehearsal tonight.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.266
I'm sure she will.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.233
Entereth!

34:49.500 --> 34:51.867
Good morrow, gentlefolk.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.500
How sleepest thou?

34:54.633 --> 34:56.066
Fair.

34:56.200 --> 34:58.000
To middling.

34:58.133 --> 34:59.400
Oh, no.

34:59.533 --> 35:01.400
Was the tent uncomfortable?

35:01.533 --> 35:02.967
No, the tank was great.

35:03.100 --> 35:06.200
It just turns out
somebody snores.

35:06.333 --> 35:07.533
- Everybody snores.
- I don't snore.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.066
- Oh, yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.533
- Yes, you do.
- Are you hungry?

35:12.333 --> 35:13.700
Yes.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.133
Thank you, Zadie.

35:16.266 --> 35:17.800
Oh, this looks so delicious.

35:17.934 --> 35:19.533
Thank you so much.

35:19.667 --> 35:21.433
It's Renaissance Day.
So we try to eat as they did.

35:21.567 --> 35:24.200
Oh. Great outfits.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.367
Oh, Mackenzie.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.033
It's a Scottish
Renaissance Fair.

35:29.166 --> 35:30.800
Well-observed, Milady.

35:30.934 --> 35:33.533
Oh, can I borrow
a phone charger?

35:33.667 --> 35:35.734
Phones almost out of juice.

35:39.834 --> 35:42.100
Not today, milord.

35:42.233 --> 35:43.367
We're off the grid.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.033
Yes.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.900
Oh, is there a power outage?

35:47.033 --> 35:49.600
Oh, no, Milady. It's voluntary.

35:49.734 --> 35:52.400
We don't just
dresseth as they did,

35:52.533 --> 35:55.367
we liveth as they did.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.633
- No electronics.
- No.

35:56.767 --> 35:57.967
- No cell phones. Nope.
- No.

35:59.767 --> 36:03.834
Woo, that seems like
a very interesting challenge.

36:03.967 --> 36:06.266
So, I guess I'll just
charge it when we get to town

36:06.400 --> 36:07.500
while you're fixing our car.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.700
Nay, milord, the whole town is

36:11.834 --> 36:15.266
offeth the grideth today.

36:15.400 --> 36:19.633
And thy carriage will
not be fixeth 'til tomorrow.

36:21.066 --> 36:22.166
Wait, what?

36:22.300 --> 36:23.934
Did you just say tomorrow?

36:24.066 --> 36:26.767
There being
no motorized carriages

36:26.900 --> 36:29.166
in what is our Renaissance

36:29.300 --> 36:31.467
one can't very well fixeth one.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.100
Didn't think to
mention that last night?

36:33.233 --> 36:37.200
Well, we did not want
to disturbeth your sleep.

36:45.500 --> 36:49.500
This is a disaster,
an absolute disaster.

36:49.633 --> 36:50.867
The nearest town is
about 20 miles away.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.500
We can walk there.
We'll find another car.

36:52.633 --> 36:55.700
I can't walk 20 miles in
a pair of heels or slippers.

36:55.834 --> 36:57.867
I need more comfortable shoes.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.967
Did they have comfortable
shoes in the Renaissance.

37:00.166 --> 37:02.233
Only I don't know how
we're going to buy a new car,

37:02.367 --> 37:04.066
because I maxed out
my credit card on the SUV

37:04.200 --> 37:05.367
and you lost her phone
and your purse.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.367
Please do not remind me.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.000
Wait, maybe we could
hire someone there

37:10.133 --> 37:11.500
to drive us to Wichita.

37:11.633 --> 37:14.166
Maybe, but again, no money.

37:14.300 --> 37:18.000
Why does this
keep on happening to us?

37:18.133 --> 37:21.000
Me thinketh the universe
is aligned against us.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.033
Or maybe...

37:27.667 --> 37:29.033
Or maybe what?

37:30.734 --> 37:32.166
They're trying to
tell us something.

37:35.834 --> 37:37.200
The stars?

37:39.166 --> 37:41.533
Okay, laugh at me all you want
and I know you will

37:41.667 --> 37:44.433
but Fun For All is not
just a business for me.

37:44.567 --> 37:45.834
It is my passion.

37:45.967 --> 37:47.734
So is Novelties R Us for me.

37:47.867 --> 37:50.233
Yeah, but, Alden, I really
believe in what I'm doing.

37:50.367 --> 37:51.900
Providing the world
with whoopee cushions

37:52.033 --> 37:53.667
and exploding fountain pens.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.033
Actually, yeah.

37:56.166 --> 37:58.000
And don't get me wrong,
I love that thing, I really do,

37:58.133 --> 37:59.767
but in about five minutes
it's gonna lose juice,

37:59.900 --> 38:03.900
and I'm going to feel
completely untethered.

38:05.567 --> 38:08.467
And that is my point.

38:08.600 --> 38:11.066
That we're too wired in.

38:11.200 --> 38:15.000
That people don't take
the time to slow down anymore.

38:17.266 --> 38:21.000
We're always looking forward,
which of course you have to do,

38:21.133 --> 38:23.433
but sometimes...

38:23.567 --> 38:25.667
...you got to look back.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.767
And Novelties R Us
and Fun For All

38:28.900 --> 38:31.166
gives people
the chance to do that.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.433
Yes.

38:32.567 --> 38:35.800
To feel like kids again.

38:35.934 --> 38:39.100
Kids in a simpler,
less frenetic time.

38:39.233 --> 38:42.066
When people appreciated...

38:42.200 --> 38:43.400
The verities.

38:44.734 --> 38:46.834
Okay, I'm not laughing.

38:46.967 --> 38:49.734
Alden, think about it.

38:49.867 --> 38:52.800
This whole crazy trip

38:52.934 --> 38:55.000
is putting us to the test,

38:55.133 --> 38:56.767
giving us a chance
to walk our walk

38:56.900 --> 38:59.266
and talk our talk.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.633
So, why don't we give into it

39:02.767 --> 39:04.200
and spend the day?

39:04.333 --> 39:07.000
Seriously?

39:07.133 --> 39:09.567
Yeah, Charlie said we'd be out
of here first thing tomorrow.

39:09.700 --> 39:13.233
So, that gives me plenty of
time to get back to Wichita,

39:13.367 --> 39:15.467
to be the maid of honor,
an unrehearsed one,

39:15.600 --> 39:17.800
but how hard can that be?

39:17.934 --> 39:20.900
Besides, by the time
we get to the next town,

39:21.033 --> 39:23.500
assuming we can even get a car,

39:23.633 --> 39:25.700
I'm going to miss
the rehearsal anyway.

39:25.834 --> 39:28.734
And I could be there today
to help my mom and my brother

39:28.867 --> 39:31.367
and my cousins prep
for the big barbecue,

39:31.500 --> 39:34.667
but do they really
need me for that?

39:34.800 --> 39:36.567
I don't know,
it could be kind of...

39:38.367 --> 39:40.333
...fun?

39:40.467 --> 39:42.166
So, what do you say?

39:45.467 --> 39:46.667
I say....

39:48.700 --> 39:50.900
...a very good day to thee. Renaissance.

39:51.033 --> 39:54.133
Ooh!

39:54.266 --> 39:56.533
No, I don't think they did
that five hundred years ago.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.066
- Probably right.
- Okay.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.333
I need to use that phone,
I have to call home,

39:59.467 --> 40:01.000
and let them know what is up.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.500
So do I.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.233
Damsels in distress first.

40:05.367 --> 40:07.166
Wait, who said
that I'm a damsel?

40:07.300 --> 40:08.400
Fine, I'm making my call first.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.000
That's okay. Thank you.

40:14.033 --> 40:15.467
Just give me like five minutes.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.800
Five minutes?

40:23.367 --> 40:25.500
These boots are
amazingly comfortable.

40:25.633 --> 40:27.066
So's the kilt.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.567
No wonder you guys
wear these things.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.500
We call it a skirt.

40:41.667 --> 40:43.834
Wow, this is amazing.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.800
Check out the band.

40:58.867 --> 41:00.467
Somebody has an admirer.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.200
Whatever dost thou mean?

41:02.333 --> 41:03.934
Thou art shameless.

41:04.066 --> 41:05.600
Welcometh.

41:05.734 --> 41:10.233
Oh, don't you two
looketh right at home!

41:10.367 --> 41:11.800
Thank you for the clothing.

41:11.934 --> 41:13.900
Charlie:
You are crushing that kilt.

41:14.033 --> 41:17.133
Crushing, Charles?
I faileth to understand.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.233
Crusheth.

41:19.367 --> 41:22.200
Who are your new friends, Mayor?

41:22.333 --> 41:23.433
Mayor?

41:23.567 --> 41:24.867
You're the mayor?

41:25.000 --> 41:28.100
Ceremonial title,
a few responsibilities.

41:28.233 --> 41:30.233
Co-equal remuneration.

41:30.367 --> 41:31.467
Don't you believe it.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.133
He rules us down
with an iron hand.

41:34.266 --> 41:35.533
Megan, Alden.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.400
This is Franklin.

41:37.533 --> 41:39.934
Franklin, we very much
enjoyeth you're fiddling.

41:40.066 --> 41:42.200
Why, thank you, Milady.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.433
Franklin's troupe--

41:43.567 --> 41:45.300
The Mackenzie Minstrels.

41:45.433 --> 41:47.266
They're going to be playing
at the dance later on tonight.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.900
Which I now regreteth.

41:49.033 --> 41:50.467
Oh, how so, dear sir?

41:50.600 --> 41:54.900
Well, if I playeth,
I do not dance it with thee.

41:55.033 --> 41:56.433
Okay.

41:56.567 --> 41:58.967
Nice to meet you, Franklin.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.266
Arts and Crafts?
We should go check that out.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.967
Anon! Come playeth our games.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.934
Archery, quoits.

42:05.066 --> 42:05.934
Quoits?

42:06.066 --> 42:06.934
Horseshoes.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.166
How do you know that?

42:08.300 --> 42:09.834
Races? Kickball?

42:09.967 --> 42:11.767
So, no jousting?

42:11.900 --> 42:14.533
Doth thou joust?

42:14.667 --> 42:16.000
Nay.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.433
I think that sounds fun.

42:17.567 --> 42:20.834
if thou enjoyeth

42:20.967 --> 42:22.200
a little friendly competition.

42:24.767 --> 42:26.600
Oh, we enjoyeth competition.

42:26.734 --> 42:28.934
Friendly or otherwise.

42:29.066 --> 42:30.533
Most wondrous.

42:30.667 --> 42:33.066
Well, I'll see thee thither.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.333
Ah, huzzah,
the McDaniel's are here!

42:38.467 --> 42:40.100
Both: Anon!

42:40.233 --> 42:42.300
Anon!

42:42.433 --> 42:43.533
That was a little nervy.

42:43.667 --> 42:44.800
What was?

42:44.934 --> 42:47.033
The fiddler,
pitching woo like that.

42:47.166 --> 42:48.800
"Pitching woo,"
is that what we're calling it?

42:48.934 --> 42:50.667
You didn't seem to
mind it one bit.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.500
I guess I didn't.

42:52.633 --> 42:54.533
For all he knew
we could have been a couple.

42:54.667 --> 42:57.467
You, me, a couple? Please.

43:18.734 --> 43:20.166
It's really pretty.

43:27.066 --> 43:29.633
Is that...

43:29.767 --> 43:32.300
Yup, that's Will.

43:32.433 --> 43:34.200
The best man.

43:34.333 --> 43:35.467
Wow.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.166
I know. Big-time wow.

43:37.300 --> 43:38.433
I'm happy you're here, though.

43:38.567 --> 43:39.667
- Hey.
- Blair: Hey.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.133
Still no Megan?

43:41.266 --> 43:42.967
No. She's not going to
make it until tomorrow.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.367
But Della is going
to fill in for now.

43:44.500 --> 43:47.333
Will, meet your
maid of honor for the day.

43:47.467 --> 43:50.367
Pleasure to meet you, Della.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.800
You, too.

43:53.934 --> 43:55.967
Looks like she means it, Will.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.500
In fact, she looks
downright Dell-lighted.

43:58.633 --> 44:01.700
Jack.

44:01.834 --> 44:02.934
That's good, right?

44:03.066 --> 44:04.367
- Jack.
- Babe.

44:12.667 --> 44:15.266
This is really cool.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.066
I know not what thoust
mean by "cool," Milady,

44:18.200 --> 44:19.567
but thank you.

44:19.700 --> 44:21.900
You made this?

44:22.033 --> 44:24.533
Yeah, I carve them
and I do the mechanics

44:24.667 --> 44:26.066
and Zadie paints them.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.400
I have a business
that sells toys like these.

44:28.533 --> 44:30.367
So, do I.
It's not the same as these.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.100
These are really special.

44:32.233 --> 44:33.834
If you're ever interested
in selling to a wider market--

44:33.967 --> 44:36.333
Both: My company would be
the perfect partner for you.

44:38.567 --> 44:39.900
I know not of that.

44:40.033 --> 44:42.166
I enjoyeth making them
for family and friends.

44:42.300 --> 44:45.033
Yet we sell at them to any
old anybody who's interested.

44:45.166 --> 44:48.200
So maybe we would like
to hear about your company.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.400
Both: Companies.

44:50.533 --> 44:53.000
Companies. Submiteth your proposals

44:53.133 --> 44:54.533
and we'll see
who's we like better.

44:54.667 --> 44:55.533
Don't worry.

44:55.667 --> 44:56.767
We shalleth.

44:56.900 --> 44:58.633
May the best proposal winneth.

45:04.266 --> 45:05.834
Wow.

45:05.967 --> 45:08.000
Fantastic. Whoa.

45:08.133 --> 45:09.567
Should bring some of
this home to my dad.

45:09.700 --> 45:12.166
He loves apple cider.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.800
Tell me about your dad.

45:13.934 --> 45:15.400
You said he's retiring.

45:15.533 --> 45:18.667
Yeah, he's a typesetter,
he's an artist.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.100
Loves his work.

45:20.233 --> 45:23.166
So why is he retiring?

45:23.300 --> 45:25.100
Because he loves golf and tennis
and rock climbing more.

45:26.734 --> 45:29.166
Your dad is a jock?

45:29.300 --> 45:30.934
Yeah, when it comes
to my brothers and me,

45:31.066 --> 45:32.400
not an athlete in the bunch.

45:32.533 --> 45:34.934
I tried Little League,
the only position I was

45:35.066 --> 45:36.500
suited for was left out.

45:36.633 --> 45:39.934
Although I will say
when I was eight years old,

45:40.066 --> 45:41.700
I killed in ballroom dancing.

45:43.100 --> 45:45.900
How about you?
What's your dad like?

45:46.033 --> 45:50.500
He passed away
about two years ago.

45:50.633 --> 45:52.300
I'm so sorry.

45:52.433 --> 45:55.400
Thanks. Just makes
Blair's wedding

45:55.533 --> 45:57.667
all that more important.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.400
It's the first big family event
since we lost him.

46:02.300 --> 46:03.867
Ooh.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.066
Very athletic.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.533
Yeah, I don't see a debate
platform or chess tournament.

46:09.667 --> 46:11.033
I think we're in trouble.

46:11.166 --> 46:14.834
We? Captain of
the volleyball and track team.

46:14.967 --> 46:16.233
Of course you were.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.667
How would your boyfriend in
Seattle feel if he knew you were

46:25.800 --> 46:28.066
making eyes at
a Mackenzie Minstrel?

46:28.200 --> 46:31.333
I am not making eyes,
and no, there's no boyfriend.

46:31.467 --> 46:34.533
So, the minstrel has a chance.

46:34.667 --> 46:37.300
Well, I haven't met Will yet.

46:37.433 --> 46:38.734
Who's Will?

46:38.867 --> 46:40.533
Jack's best man.

46:40.667 --> 46:42.800
Apparently we're perfect
for each other.

49:12.734 --> 49:14.133
Sorry!

49:27.800 --> 49:29.834
Art thou in pain, good sir?

49:29.967 --> 49:33.200
Yes, used muscles
I didn't know I had.

49:33.333 --> 49:35.266
Aye, in a Renaissance,
we worketh hard

49:35.400 --> 49:37.500
and we playeth it hard.

49:37.633 --> 49:39.867
Clearly I'm not equipeth
for these times.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.533
Well, uh,
I doth not knoweth that.

49:42.667 --> 49:44.367
While the real men
huntereth and gathereth,

49:44.500 --> 49:47.033
I prefereth to stayeth
at home and readeth.

49:47.166 --> 49:50.166
Much like our beloved
William Shakespeare.

49:50.300 --> 49:52.500
He was also a brilliant actor,
successful entrepreneur,

49:52.633 --> 49:54.667
and a formidable wrestler.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.066
I did a report on him
when I was in seventh grade.

49:57.200 --> 50:01.367
But tis his intelligence
that attracteth the damsels.

50:06.633 --> 50:09.834
Megan claimeth
to not be a damsel.

50:09.967 --> 50:12.533
Be that as it may,

50:12.667 --> 50:16.367
even in these times,
a lady knoweth how to, well,

50:16.500 --> 50:19.633
whet a man's interest by paying
attention to someone else.

50:22.133 --> 50:23.800
Are we having
a teachable moment here, guys?

50:25.233 --> 50:26.367
"Teachable moment?"

50:26.500 --> 50:30.100
Why, whatever dost thou meaneth?

50:32.533 --> 50:33.767
Excuse me.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.200
I'm sorry about your foot.

51:11.333 --> 51:12.567
I just got to face it.

51:12.700 --> 51:14.033
Renaissance is not my jam.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.867
Ah, what a grand day,
fellow Mackenzians.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.667
It's an honor
to be in Mackenzie

51:23.800 --> 51:26.700
and to stand in the same
place that my forebears did

51:26.834 --> 51:28.333
when they founded this town.

51:29.667 --> 51:32.100
Sixth generation.

51:32.233 --> 51:34.834
And they would have
loved this annual fair

51:34.967 --> 51:37.934
and they'd want to thank ye
all for coming from near and far

51:38.066 --> 51:40.000
including our
very special guests.

51:41.633 --> 51:43.867
Yes, it's a grand day, indeed,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.433
but all grand days must end,

51:46.567 --> 51:50.567
and the Mackenzie Minstrels will
help us bid the past goodbye

51:50.700 --> 51:53.834
with a lovely
16th century waltz.

51:53.967 --> 51:55.333
Valorous night, good townfolk.

51:55.467 --> 51:58.567
Walketh home safely.

52:00.767 --> 52:03.300
Did he say-- The waltz!

52:03.433 --> 52:05.166
I can do that!

52:05.300 --> 52:06.633
Second grade ballroom dancing.

52:06.767 --> 52:08.166
Listen, I don't know
how to waltz. I don't--

52:08.300 --> 52:11.433
It's okay.
Just, uh, follow my lead.

52:11.567 --> 52:12.767
Put your hand on my shoulder.

52:14.100 --> 52:15.400
Like that.

52:19.633 --> 52:20.767
Ready?

52:20.900 --> 52:22.467
I think so.

52:22.600 --> 52:25.834
One, two three. That's okay.

52:31.467 --> 52:33.033
There you go.

53:30.867 --> 53:32.300
As far as rehearsal dinners go,

53:32.433 --> 53:34.033
I'd say that was
a darn good one.

53:34.166 --> 53:36.066
It was the best one
of mine I've ever been to.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Somebody's hitting it off.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.700
Will told me
he's completely smitten.

53:42.834 --> 53:43.967
Yeah, as well he should be.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.200
I mean, she's a doll.

53:45.333 --> 53:47.667
I always thought so.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.533
But I don't think she has.

53:50.667 --> 53:52.166
I love seeing
her shine like this.

53:53.800 --> 53:57.233
Insightful, empathetic, kind.

53:57.367 --> 53:59.567
I mean, I could really
go for a guy like you.

53:59.700 --> 54:02.400
Don't.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

54:02.533 --> 54:04.033
She's a very lucky woman.

54:05.100 --> 54:06.467
Not as lucky as I am.

54:11.100 --> 54:13.300
Okay, buster. That's it.

54:13.433 --> 54:15.934
You're not seeing me again until
you're on that altar tomorrow.

54:16.066 --> 54:20.200
Not true. I'll be seeing you
constantly right here.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.033
Hey.

54:22.166 --> 54:24.100
Aren't you forgetting something?

54:24.233 --> 54:28.367
Sorry, I'd stay
and "punnel" you with yolks,

54:28.500 --> 54:30.967
but, alas, I must make
like autumn and leaf.

54:31.100 --> 54:34.033
That's my guy.

54:34.166 --> 54:35.567
Oh!

54:35.700 --> 54:37.967
Excuse me!

54:38.100 --> 54:40.066
Ah, enough. Enough.

54:40.200 --> 54:42.300
Oh, I thought
you were enjoying it.

54:42.433 --> 54:45.934
No, I was I'm just so exhausted.

54:46.066 --> 54:47.700
Ah, right.

54:47.834 --> 54:51.100
Because winning race after race
makes you really drained, right?

54:51.233 --> 54:52.633
Don't forget quoits.

54:52.767 --> 54:54.100
How could I?

54:54.233 --> 54:55.934
Surprised they didn't
throw me in the pillory

54:56.066 --> 54:58.066
for attempted assault
with a deadly weapon.

55:03.066 --> 55:06.200
I had a lot of fun today.
I'm glad we stayed.

55:06.333 --> 55:08.300
Yeah, me too.

55:08.433 --> 55:10.467
No, you did not.
Not until the waltz.

55:10.600 --> 55:11.867
I mean,
you were completely miserable.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.633
You lost every game.

55:13.767 --> 55:15.266
Okay, fine.
Yeah, I was miserable,

55:15.400 --> 55:19.700
but not because you beat me
at every single game.

55:22.967 --> 55:24.433
Like ducks it wasn't.

55:24.567 --> 55:26.033
Who says "like ducks?"

55:27.300 --> 55:30.200
Hey, where are you going?

55:30.333 --> 55:31.800
Charlie and Zadie's
place is this way noted.

55:31.934 --> 55:33.700
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

55:33.834 --> 55:35.834
- Nope.
- Yes.

55:35.967 --> 55:39.233
Fine, suit yourself,
but I'm going to go this way.

55:49.967 --> 55:52.166
A man who admits he's lost.

55:52.300 --> 55:53.533
How refreshing.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.567
Okay, say it.

56:02.700 --> 56:03.834
Say what?

56:03.967 --> 56:05.066
I told you so.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.867
What kind of
a person would say that?

56:07.000 --> 56:09.166
An olden kind of person?

56:09.300 --> 56:11.533
Megan Miller,
you don't know me at all.

56:13.834 --> 56:15.367
Let's get an aerial view.

56:16.667 --> 56:18.433
What? Not inspired to climb?

56:18.567 --> 56:20.834
I'm wearing a very long skirt.

56:20.967 --> 56:23.000
I'm wearing a kilt.

56:23.133 --> 56:24.500
Come on.

56:25.867 --> 56:27.767
Alright.

56:38.834 --> 56:40.200
Hey.

56:42.133 --> 56:43.667
Are you ready for tomorrow?

56:43.800 --> 56:45.200
Scooch over.

56:45.333 --> 56:48.767
Sometimes I think
I've been ready for tomorrow

56:48.900 --> 56:52.233
my whole life.

56:52.367 --> 56:53.734
Here.

56:53.867 --> 56:58.033
I remember
my wedding day so vividly.

56:58.166 --> 57:00.633
It was the happiest day
of my life,

57:00.767 --> 57:03.133
until I held Megan in my arms,

57:03.266 --> 57:04.667
then you.

57:08.867 --> 57:10.967
What was your secret, Mom?

57:11.100 --> 57:14.667
You and Dad, you guys,
you made happy seem so easy.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.300
Oh, it was all
smoke and mirrors.

57:17.433 --> 57:19.066
No, it wasn't.

57:21.633 --> 57:23.900
Well, I don't know. I--

57:24.033 --> 57:26.300
I really don't only that

57:26.433 --> 57:28.834
every day I'd wake up
and tell myself

57:28.967 --> 57:31.100
to make this day
the best one yet.

57:31.233 --> 57:34.166
No matter what came at me.

57:34.300 --> 57:35.533
Your dad did the same.

57:38.100 --> 57:41.734
Still can't believe that he's
not going to be there tomorrow.

57:41.867 --> 57:43.266
Oh, sweetheart. He will.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.367
Megan is going to look so
pretty in that dress tomorrow.

57:51.633 --> 57:53.300
If she gets here.

57:53.433 --> 57:54.667
She will.

58:03.767 --> 58:06.266
Maybe it's a mirage.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.467
Maybe the whole town is.

58:09.600 --> 58:10.767
Like Brigadoon.

58:10.900 --> 58:12.600
It only appears
every hundred years.

58:12.734 --> 58:15.333
And then dissolves
into the mist again.

58:15.467 --> 58:18.000
Or maybe we're just
good and lost.

58:18.133 --> 58:19.400
I'll put my money on that one.

58:20.734 --> 58:22.400
Although...

58:24.934 --> 58:27.066
It's a darn nice
place to be lost in.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.667
Copy that.

58:41.800 --> 58:45.000
What did you mean earlier
when you said that it wasn't me

58:45.133 --> 58:48.100
beating you that
made you miserable?

58:50.734 --> 58:52.967
Really?

58:53.100 --> 58:54.567
You need me to say it?

58:56.200 --> 58:57.567
Yeah.

58:59.900 --> 59:01.500
I was jealous.

59:04.100 --> 59:05.200
Jealous?

59:05.333 --> 59:06.934
Of you and Franklin.

59:11.600 --> 59:13.900
I kind of thought
that's what it was.

59:14.033 --> 59:16.066
Okay, but tell me something.

59:17.767 --> 59:19.734
Was there not a part
of you that was...

59:21.500 --> 59:22.767
...trying to make me jealous?

59:25.166 --> 59:26.667
I guess I was.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.400
What's that all about?

59:34.800 --> 59:36.133
Is that a serious question?

59:38.200 --> 59:39.767
Megan, come on.

59:41.367 --> 59:42.800
In high school...

59:44.834 --> 59:46.300
...I had a huge crush on you.

59:48.367 --> 59:49.500
You did?

59:49.633 --> 59:52.400
Yeah, every debate,

59:52.533 --> 59:55.000
every prep squad rally.

59:55.133 --> 59:58.300
Every time our schools
were facing off, I, uh--

1:00:00.700 --> 1:00:01.934
I hoped you'd be there.

1:00:06.467 --> 1:00:07.834
Wow.

1:00:09.300 --> 1:00:10.967
How come you never
asked me out then?

1:00:13.533 --> 1:00:16.333
Like you would have
said yes.

1:00:19.700 --> 1:00:22.834
I think I would have.

1:00:22.967 --> 1:00:24.166
Really?

1:00:24.300 --> 1:00:26.734
Yeah. I mean,
you were only annoying,

1:00:26.867 --> 1:00:28.400
because you were good at
absolutely everything,

1:00:28.533 --> 1:00:29.800
but...

1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:33.834
I always thought you were
kinda cool.

1:00:40.300 --> 1:00:42.200
Wow.

1:00:42.333 --> 1:00:44.734
But that was
in high school.

1:00:44.867 --> 1:00:46.200
- Alden: Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:00:46.333 --> 1:00:47.800
Alden: Right, right.

1:00:47.934 --> 1:00:51.300
So, why would I try and make you
jealous now?

1:00:51.433 --> 1:00:55.633
Yeah, why would you?

1:00:55.767 --> 1:00:58.233
But you were.

1:00:58.367 --> 1:01:00.567
And I was.

1:01:42.700 --> 1:01:44.400
Guess we slept here.

1:01:44.533 --> 1:01:46.867
Alden: Yep.

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.600
Wait...

1:01:48.734 --> 1:01:52.867
Oh, I was gonna surprise you
with it when we got to Wichita,

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.133
but... it got a little cold
last night.

1:01:57.266 --> 1:01:59.433
- Where did you get it?
- The fair.

1:01:59.567 --> 1:02:01.867
One of the craft tables.

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.800
It's not as perfect as the one
you wore to the prom,

1:02:04.934 --> 1:02:08.266
but... I figure, it's yours now,
and Blair can borrow it.

1:02:10.266 --> 1:02:11.467
Alden.

1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:16.800
Oh, thank you.

1:02:20.834 --> 1:02:22.600
Guess what.

1:02:22.734 --> 1:02:26.200
What?

1:02:26.333 --> 1:02:28.266
We couldn't see it
in the dark.

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:31.667
The lights were off,
they were off the grid.

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:34.300
So, direction-wise,
I was right.

1:02:34.433 --> 1:02:36.100
You usually are.

1:02:39.266 --> 1:02:40.266
Shall we?

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:43.400
We shall.

1:02:52.433 --> 1:02:54.433
There you are.
Good morning.

1:02:54.567 --> 1:02:56.667
I was just about to come
wake you up.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:58.500
I washed
and dried your clothes.

1:02:58.633 --> 1:03:00.500
Oh, Zadie.

1:03:00.633 --> 1:03:02.367
So, why don't you have some
nice breakfast,

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:04.266
and then you can go
and freshen up.

1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:07.233
Charlie is in the garage,
working on your car.

1:03:07.367 --> 1:03:08.533
Thank you so much.

1:03:08.667 --> 1:03:09.867
You guys are the best.

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.834
And I will be in touch
real soon

1:03:13.967 --> 1:03:16.533
with a proposal
for those toys.

1:03:16.667 --> 1:03:18.000
- So will I.
- Mmm.

1:03:18.133 --> 1:03:21.100
Well, uh,
we got a wee problem.

1:03:21.233 --> 1:03:22.867
Oh no.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.734
I got everything on that, uh,
car, patched up just fine,

1:03:26.867 --> 1:03:29.567
and then I went to replace
the busted serpentine belt,

1:03:29.700 --> 1:03:31.500
and um... well,
I don't have the right size.

1:03:31.633 --> 1:03:33.166
Clean out of stock.

1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:36.166
I don't know what
a serpentine belt is.

1:03:36.300 --> 1:03:37.734
- Neither do I.
- Do we need one.

1:03:37.867 --> 1:03:39.400
Well if you wanna drive
the car, you do.

1:03:39.533 --> 1:03:41.066
Alden:
How soon can you get one?

1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:42.567
Ooh. Tomorrow?

1:03:42.700 --> 1:03:45.033
No!

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:48.166
Alden and Megan's Reverie in
Renaissanceville ends now!

1:03:48.300 --> 1:03:50.700
Charlie, we are going
to Wichita,

1:03:50.834 --> 1:03:54.500
and if that car is not
gonna get us there,

1:03:54.633 --> 1:03:56.734
you better help find
a vehicle that will.

1:03:56.867 --> 1:03:58.166
Like, immediately.

1:03:58.300 --> 1:03:59.934
Uh-- Ah...

1:04:00.133 --> 1:04:03.066
Well, I suppose you could take
the tow truck.

1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:04.300
It's kinda pokey.

1:04:04.433 --> 1:04:06.066
It's just a little pokey, though.

1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:26.767
Okay, in 20 miles,
there's a turn-off

1:04:26.900 --> 1:04:28.433
that'll take us to
the interstate.

1:04:28.567 --> 1:04:30.934
Oh, this thing makes that van
feel like a Ferrari.

1:04:35.900 --> 1:04:40.400
Oh, what?
You have got to be kidding me.

1:04:40.533 --> 1:04:44.266
What? Are we being pulled over
because we're driving too slow?

1:04:52.233 --> 1:04:53.767
Whatever we did,

1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:55.367
let's hope they write tickets
around here fast.

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:57.367
Fat chance.

1:04:59.867 --> 1:05:02.300
Here he comes.

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:06.467
- Franklin?
- Is this your vehicle, Miss?

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:08.033
Uh, no.
It's Charlie's.

1:05:08.166 --> 1:05:09.300
And where are you
headed today?

1:05:09.433 --> 1:05:10.600
Wichita.

1:05:10.734 --> 1:05:12.367
Are you travelin' there
with her, sir?

1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:14.166
What's this
all about, Franklin?

1:05:14.300 --> 1:05:17.033
Stay in the vehicle, both of
you. Hands where I can see them.

1:05:17.166 --> 1:05:19.633
Megan: Wha...

1:05:23.667 --> 1:05:25.133
- What did we do?
- I don't know.

1:05:25.266 --> 1:05:26.934
- Did you know he was a cop?
- No, I had no idea.

1:05:27.066 --> 1:05:29.100
- Well, he seems pretty upset.
- Very upset.

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.533
He's coming. Okay, okay.

1:05:48.300 --> 1:05:50.533
Couple of jugs
of Mackenzie's cider.

1:05:50.667 --> 1:05:53.767
I hear you like it.

1:05:55.100 --> 1:05:56.433
I had you pretty scared,
didn't I?

1:05:56.567 --> 1:05:58.300
Uh, yeah, you did.

1:05:58.433 --> 1:06:00.266
Franklin:
I just fiddle for fun.

1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:01.700
This is my day job.

1:06:01.834 --> 1:06:03.700
Ah, well,
you're pretty good at it.

1:06:03.834 --> 1:06:05.500
Thank you.

1:06:05.633 --> 1:06:08.200
And you may be the single most
uncoordinated human being

1:06:08.333 --> 1:06:11.033
I have ever met...
until you waltz,

1:06:11.166 --> 1:06:12.500
then you're magic, dude.

1:06:12.633 --> 1:06:15.200
Thank you--
both of you,

1:06:15.333 --> 1:06:17.934
for helping to make yesterday
one of my best days ever.

1:06:18.066 --> 1:06:21.633
Oh, well, it was one of
our best days too.

1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:26.867
Well, I'll let you off with
a warning this time.

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.166
And I hope to see you back here
next year.

1:06:29.300 --> 1:06:31.700
Won't be the same fair
without ya.

1:06:31.834 --> 1:06:35.166
Thanks, Franklin.

1:06:36.633 --> 1:06:40.333
- Brigadoon.
- Oh, yes! Definitely.

1:06:41.633 --> 1:06:42.934
You sure you don't wanna disappear

1:06:43.066 --> 1:06:44.233
into the mist with him?

1:06:44.367 --> 1:06:47.433
Oh, I'm tempted,
but I think I'm good.

1:06:47.567 --> 1:06:48.700
Alden: All right.

1:06:48.834 --> 1:06:51.700
Let's get out of here.

1:06:51.834 --> 1:06:54.533
Definitely.

1:06:58.467 --> 1:06:59.667
No.

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:01.667
Ugh! No!

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:04.567
Come on, you've got to be
kidding me.

1:07:06.633 --> 1:07:07.767
- Come on.
- Come on, pokey!

1:07:09.567 --> 1:07:11.300
Quick, before He changes
His mind.

1:07:11.433 --> 1:07:12.333
Okay.

1:07:37.734 --> 1:07:39.166
They've just hit
the city limits,

1:07:39.300 --> 1:07:42.667
but there's
a lot of traffic.

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:44.266
So... what do you want
to do?

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:47.066
Um...

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:50.400
Let's give her another...
20 minutes.

1:07:50.533 --> 1:07:53.567
And then come be my maid
of honor.

1:07:53.700 --> 1:07:54.800
Oh, Blair. I can't--

1:07:54.934 --> 1:07:56.967
I will love having you
beside me,

1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:58.900
and so will Will.

1:08:17.433 --> 1:08:21.100
Oh, sweetheart.
You look glorious.

1:08:22.133 --> 1:08:25.166
Mom, you're crying already!

1:08:25.300 --> 1:08:27.800
Oh, I'll be crying all day.
Get used to it.

1:08:29.467 --> 1:08:30.834
Let's do this.

1:08:47.967 --> 1:08:50.000
Alden: Oh, great.
We're boxed in.

1:09:18.367 --> 1:09:20.200
- Ah!
- Ah!

1:09:20.333 --> 1:09:22.066
- We made it!
- It is a miracle.

1:09:29.033 --> 1:09:32.300
So, I was thinking, when
we're back in Seattle...

1:09:32.433 --> 1:09:36.400
Yeah, let's maybe, uh, get
together sometime.

1:09:36.533 --> 1:09:39.066
Yeah, hang out,
or something.

1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.000
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:09:43.100 --> 1:09:45.100
Well, I-- I should be
getting in there.

1:09:45.233 --> 1:09:47.300
Right, yes. Go.

1:09:47.433 --> 1:09:49.233
Uh, have a great wedding.

1:09:49.367 --> 1:09:51.133
Thanks, you too.
Have a great party.

1:09:51.266 --> 1:09:52.967
Alden: Thanks.

1:09:54.567 --> 1:09:55.934
Don't forget the cider.

1:09:56.066 --> 1:09:58.934
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, thanks.
- There you go.

1:09:59.066 --> 1:10:00.967
And thank you again.

1:10:01.100 --> 1:10:02.500
Okay, bye.

1:10:28.567 --> 1:10:29.867
Okay.

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.600
Oh! Ah, Della.

1:10:32.734 --> 1:10:34.100
Uh, Megan.

1:10:34.233 --> 1:10:36.867
Look at that dress.
You look fantastic.

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.200
Thanks.

1:10:38.333 --> 1:10:39.867
Are you on your way
over there?

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.867
Uh, yeah, they left your mom's
car for you,

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.100
but I-- I can wait.

1:10:43.233 --> 1:10:44.934
Oh, no, no, no,
that's okay.

1:10:45.066 --> 1:10:47.400
You can just go over there,
let them know I am on my way.

1:10:47.533 --> 1:10:48.867
I have no cellphone.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.734
Oh, right.

1:10:50.867 --> 1:10:52.700
I'll see you over there.
Oh, um, oh...

1:10:52.834 --> 1:10:55.800
I left the invitation
in my luggage.

1:10:55.934 --> 1:10:57.300
What church is it at?

1:10:57.433 --> 1:10:59.300
First Consecrational.

1:10:59.433 --> 1:11:03.533
Right. Okay.
Thank you, Della.

1:11:03.667 --> 1:11:05.567
Bye.

1:12:04.033 --> 1:12:06.166
Megan!

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:09.667
I'm such a bad person.
I-- I did such a bad thing.

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:11.433
Della, what are you talking
about?

1:12:11.567 --> 1:12:16.333
These past few days,
I've felt so captivating and...

1:12:16.467 --> 1:12:19.266
attractive and... fun,

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.567
and... guys don't go for me,

1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:23.033
you know they don't.

1:12:23.166 --> 1:12:26.767
But Will did, and I know
the minute he sees you

1:12:26.900 --> 1:12:29.166
and walks down
the aisle with you,

1:12:29.300 --> 1:12:33.367
he's gonna forget all about me,
and who can blame him?

1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:35.600
You're so fabulous.

1:12:35.734 --> 1:12:38.667
So, I-- I don't know
what came over me.

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:41.867
I think I lost my mind for
a minute. And...

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.767
So, you sent me to
the wrong church?

1:12:45.133 --> 1:12:46.834
Yes.

1:12:46.967 --> 1:12:49.033
It's okay, Della.

1:12:49.166 --> 1:12:51.500
Let's get us to the right one.
Come on, I'll follow you.

1:13:02.333 --> 1:13:04.166
They're getting a bit antsy
in there.

1:13:04.300 --> 1:13:06.800
Well, I suppose I could get
married with no maid of honor.

1:13:06.934 --> 1:13:08.133
Mom:
Oh, no, no, sweetheart.

1:13:10.467 --> 1:13:14.200
They're here.

1:13:14.333 --> 1:13:16.033
You waited!
Thank you!

1:13:16.166 --> 1:13:18.233
- Blair: Megan!
- Blair!

1:13:18.367 --> 1:13:20.900
You look transcendent.
Hi, Mom.

1:13:21.033 --> 1:13:22.400
Wait, why are
you wearing--

1:13:22.533 --> 1:13:24.166
I'll tell you
about it later.

1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:27.200
Ah, Will. I'm Megan.
So nice to meet you.

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:30.533
Best man and maid of honor they
go behind the bridesmaids

1:13:30.667 --> 1:13:31.967
- and groomsmen, right?
- Uh...

1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:34.367
Uh, no, Megan.
You're the maid of honor.

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:36.367
No time to change it.
Plus, you rehearsed it.

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:37.800
So, what number bridesmaid
are you?

1:13:37.934 --> 1:13:39.467
Number one.

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:41.033
And who am I walking with?

1:13:41.166 --> 1:13:43.266
Mom:
Oh, just one moment!

1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:47.200
Here you go, sweetheart.

1:13:47.333 --> 1:13:50.400
- Thanks, Mom.
- And for you.

1:13:50.533 --> 1:13:51.967
- Thanks, Mom.
- All right.

1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:53.767
Let's get this girl married!

1:13:56.533 --> 1:13:59.133
Wait, hold that thought.

1:14:04.166 --> 1:14:06.233
I don't know.

1:14:06.367 --> 1:14:08.700
Oh, Megan.

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.400
Now you're ready
to get married.

1:14:13.533 --> 1:14:16.600
Thank you.

1:14:16.734 --> 1:14:19.900
Okay.

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:46.233
Oh, Mom!

1:14:47.433 --> 1:14:48.600
Are you ready?

1:14:48.734 --> 1:14:51.900
Yes.

1:14:54.166 --> 1:14:56.567
The proverbial "they" say
true love

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:58.567
can overcome any obstacle.

1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:01.266
Although, I think snoring comes
pretty close

1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:03.300
to being a deal breaker,
if you ask me.

1:15:05.433 --> 1:15:09.367
Jack and Blair, I don't know
what obstacles

1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:12.166
you had to overcome
for the sake of your love.

1:15:12.300 --> 1:15:14.500
You ever hear
this guy pun?

1:15:14.633 --> 1:15:17.033
Oh, right. Right, yeah.
There's that.

1:15:17.166 --> 1:15:18.533
There's that. You do that.

1:15:18.667 --> 1:15:20.934
Well, okay, one thing, but let's
hope that's it,

1:15:21.066 --> 1:15:23.300
now and forever.

1:15:23.433 --> 1:15:27.233
However, not all love
is romantic.

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:33.767
The love between
two sisters

1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:35.667
is a pretty powerful one too.

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:37.467
It is.

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:39.667
Ugh! And let me tell you,

1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:43.867
the obstacles I had to get
through to get to this sister!

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.133
Okay, here I go.

1:15:45.266 --> 1:15:47.867
Um, an airport strike...

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.300
a stolen car, stolen luggage,
stolen phone!

1:15:52.433 --> 1:15:54.500
Which was the cruelest
of them all.

1:15:56.133 --> 1:15:58.500
Oh, right, a van in a ditch...

1:15:58.633 --> 1:16:02.266
um, a day without electricity
or internet--

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:05.200
which is not as gnarly
as you think.

1:16:05.333 --> 1:16:07.600
An undersized
serpentine belt--

1:16:07.734 --> 1:16:10.233
which, I still don't know that
that is.

1:16:10.367 --> 1:16:13.834
A tow truck going at the speed
of snail,

1:16:13.967 --> 1:16:16.200
and a trip to
the wrong church!

1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:21.667
Don't worry about it.

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:23.367
Now, I could have
just stayed home,

1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:24.900
and watched
the countless uploads

1:16:25.033 --> 1:16:26.433
you guys are all gonna post
of this wedding--

1:16:26.567 --> 1:16:28.767
and don't tell me
you're not going to.

1:16:30.166 --> 1:16:33.000
But not be there...

1:16:33.133 --> 1:16:35.500
for my sister's biggest day?

1:16:35.633 --> 1:16:39.166
I can't imagine
anything sadder,

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:42.200
because this sister

1:16:42.333 --> 1:16:46.900
has been
the brightest star in my sky

1:16:47.033 --> 1:16:50.700
since as long
as I can remember.

1:16:50.834 --> 1:16:52.700
Blair, to see you so beautiful...

1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:57.066
...with the rightest guy in
the world for you,

1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:59.166
there is no obstacle that would
have stopped me

1:16:59.300 --> 1:17:02.233
from being here today.

1:17:02.367 --> 1:17:05.500
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1:17:05.633 --> 1:17:09.934
So, please raise your glass in
helping me toast

1:17:10.066 --> 1:17:14.066
to the couple
of this hour,

1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:15.967
and every hour,

1:17:16.100 --> 1:17:19.000
Jack and Blair Evans.

1:17:19.133 --> 1:17:20.266
Cheers.

1:17:26.900 --> 1:17:29.100
I needed that after my day...

1:17:29.233 --> 1:17:30.400
but thanks
for all being here.

Megan: I think that's probably

That was really sweet of you.
What you did at the church.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:47.900
Today's all about love.

1:17:48.033 --> 1:17:49.333
How can I get in the way
of that?

1:17:49.467 --> 1:17:51.000
Oh, they've only known each
other for a day.

1:17:51.133 --> 1:17:53.934
Oh, come on, Blair,
think positive.

1:17:55.767 --> 1:17:58.467
Mmm, by the way, you neglected
to mention

1:17:58.600 --> 1:17:59.967
the biggest obstacle
to you getting here.

1:18:00.166 --> 1:18:01.734
Megan: What?

1:18:01.867 --> 1:18:03.400
Forty-eight hours joined at
the hip with Alden Brown.

1:18:03.533 --> 1:18:06.533
I mean, he must
have driven you crazy.

1:18:06.667 --> 1:18:07.900
Actually, he didn't.

1:18:08.033 --> 1:18:10.633
- No?
- No.

1:18:10.767 --> 1:18:13.367
He wasn't as bad
as I thought he was.

1:18:13.500 --> 1:18:15.467
Oh. Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

1:18:26.133 --> 1:18:28.633
What is he doing here?

1:18:28.767 --> 1:18:31.200
You better go find out.

1:18:31.333 --> 1:18:32.900
Megan, go.

We went to Central together.

1:18:45.133 --> 1:18:46.734
Yeah. It's Alden Brown.

1:18:46.867 --> 1:18:49.900
Right. Great guy. Hands down
the smartest kid in class.

1:18:50.033 --> 1:18:51.834

- Uh...

1:18:51.967 --> 1:18:56.367

Wait, how did you know--

1:19:02.533 --> 1:19:03.867
Social media.

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.133
Half the people here
are live-updating this.

1:19:06.266 --> 1:19:07.533
I knew it.

1:19:09.100 --> 1:19:10.633
So, why aren't you at your dad's
party then?

1:19:10.767 --> 1:19:12.700
I'm just taking a break.

1:19:12.834 --> 1:19:15.767
They probably don't even know
I'm gone.

1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:19.533
Thing is, I was right,
they didn't need me there.

1:19:19.667 --> 1:19:23.200
I needed me
to be there and...

1:19:23.333 --> 1:19:27.033
I needed you to have this.

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:30.133
Top shelf of the family room
just like I thought.

1:19:30.266 --> 1:19:33.900
Oh, wow. You did not need to
bring me this!

1:19:34.033 --> 1:19:37.433
Uh, I have it on good authority
that I did.

1:19:37.567 --> 1:19:39.467
And I also don't have
your number

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:41.967
or your address
in Seattle.

1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:44.633
Well, you know Fun For All does
have a Contact Me link.

1:19:44.767 --> 1:19:47.066
About that.

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:49.633
See, I was thinking, you could
submit your proposal

1:19:49.767 --> 1:19:52.133
to Zadie and Charlie,
and I could submit mine.

1:19:52.266 --> 1:19:53.567
Mmm-hmm.

1:19:53.700 --> 1:19:54.800
Would they be any different?

1:19:54.934 --> 1:19:56.300
No, probably not, no.

1:19:56.433 --> 1:20:00.066
So, I was thinking, what if we
just submitted--

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:01.967
- One proposal.
- Right.

1:20:02.100 --> 1:20:04.133
- And then we could--
- Share the business.

1:20:04.266 --> 1:20:06.033
Right. And then we'll do
the same thing with--

1:20:06.166 --> 1:20:07.934
With Consolidated. We can stop
chopping up the market.

1:20:08.066 --> 1:20:09.700
And then we'll just work together.

1:20:09.834 --> 1:20:11.533
Yeah. Why fight to crowd each
other out of the space--

1:20:11.667 --> 1:20:13.066
That we love when
we can just--

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:15.533
Join forces. We could...

1:20:15.667 --> 1:20:17.200
Own it together.

1:20:17.333 --> 1:20:19.133
Fun Time Novelties.

1:20:19.266 --> 1:20:22.533
Novelties R Fun.

1:20:22.667 --> 1:20:24.600
Oh, whatever.

1:20:30.233 --> 1:20:31.934
Um...

1:20:32.066 --> 1:20:35.100
Look, the bottom line is...

1:20:35.233 --> 1:20:39.200
I don't wanna just maybe
call you

1:20:39.333 --> 1:20:42.367
when we get to Seattle

1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:43.867
and maybe, sort of hang out.

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.567
I want to see you
as soon as I can,

1:20:47.700 --> 1:20:50.467
as soon as you're back,

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:54.133
properly, like over dinner?

1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:01.533
Are you asking me out,
Alden Brown?

1:21:01.667 --> 1:21:03.934
I think I am,
Megan Miller.

1:21:04.066 --> 1:21:07.233
Well, took you
long enough.

1:21:08.900 --> 1:21:11.633
What can I say, girls mature
faster than boys.

1:21:11.767 --> 1:21:13.266
Megan: I think we debated
that proposal.

1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:16.500
Uh, yeah, we did, and I won,
but the data were bogus.

1:21:16.633 --> 1:21:17.900
No doubt.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.266
Okay, so just
to be clear here.

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:25.367
We don't hate each other
anymore?

1:21:42.567 --> 1:21:45.700
I'm pretty sure
that we don't.

1:21:48.967 --> 1:21:51.667
Um...

1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:54.500
I guess I should go back
to my dad's party.

1:21:54.633 --> 1:21:57.867
Oh. Come on.
One more dance?

1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.600
I could ask the DJ if he could
play a waltz.

1:22:00.734 --> 1:22:02.600
I don't know.

1:22:02.734 --> 1:22:05.400
I mean, I don't want to steal
Jack and Blair's thunder.

1:22:05.533 --> 1:22:07.734
I think after
all we've been through,

1:22:07.867 --> 1:22:10.867
we deserve to steal
a little bit of it.

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.200
Don't you think?
