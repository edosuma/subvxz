WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:07.048
I wanted a big town car.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.426
He gives me one of his
repo'ed Tokyo bug boxes.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.802
Hey, free's free, my man.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.179
I ain't never even got
a Christmas card from my brother-in-law.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.222
-Free?
-Mm-hm.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.474
How many times you had to
drive me to work this year?

00:16.558 --> 00:19.019
You know how much old Rob's
making on my repairs?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.521
(tires screech)

00:21.604 --> 00:23.940
That jerk is either drunk or stoned, Neal.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.527
(tires squeal)

00:29.112 --> 00:31.114
-(tires screech)
-Hey!

00:32.657 --> 00:35.785
Hey. Police.
Pull around the corner, up on the curb.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.539
I think that's Tony Catina.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.636
Hi, guys. Tony Catina.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.723
-Hope we don't got a problem.
-Let's see your license and registration.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.683
I got a little medical
emergency here, guys.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.394
-What kind of medical emergency?
-A young lady who's gonna die

01:01.478 --> 01:04.189
if Tony doesn't administer mouth-to-mouth
pretty damn quick.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.024
Have you been drinking, Mr. Catina?

01:06.107 --> 01:08.526
Maybe you didn't get the name?
Tony Catina.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.028
Played a little ball in this town.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.530
Are you aware your license
is expired, Mr. Catina?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.157
Oh, no. Really?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.534
(laughing) I guess I'm gonna
get the slammer for that.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.162
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for suspicion of drunk driving.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.955
Come on, guys, can't we let this slide?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.416
You will let the lady down,
not to mention the little kids

01:23.500 --> 01:26.628
who watch my anti-alcohol commercial.
You'll break their little hearts.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.922
Item six: temporary assignments.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.634
This, uh, this flu bug
is still causing havoc.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.720
Sergeant Bates,
Officers Guaraldi, Kaplan, and Marcos

01:35.804 --> 01:37.680
are all at home kissing the sheets.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.517
And the verdict is still out
on LaRue and Washington.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.353
As of now, Coffey is gonna
ride with Haines.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.688
And Winslow with Dombrowski.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.525
Item seven: Mick Belker
is gonna be undercover

01:48.608 --> 01:50.902
at the East Side Animal Shelter.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.362
As a purebred or a mutt?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.863
(officers whooping)

01:53.947 --> 01:55.448
STAN: Hey, hey, hey!

01:55.532 --> 01:58.159
We got reports
that somebody over at the pound

01:58.243 --> 02:01.704
is selling some of those poor
strays to research labs,

02:01.788 --> 02:03.581
where they do God knows what to them.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.209
Yeah, you don't want to get me started

02:06.292 --> 02:10.004
on what I think of the scum
that is cruel to animals, I'm worried.

02:10.088 --> 02:14.008
All right, item eight:
this is a memo from Division.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.718
(officers groaning)

02:15.802 --> 02:22.142
Yeah, it's re: the use of
personal electrical devices on prisoners.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.687
I quote, "Departmental regulations forbid

02:25.770 --> 02:29.691
the use of nonissue weapons of any kind.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.568
The use of any personal weapons,

02:31.651 --> 02:33.987
including the use of electrical devices

02:34.070 --> 02:37.198
other than department-issue stun guns

02:37.282 --> 02:41.703
will result in immediate
suspension without pay."

02:41.786 --> 02:43.872
People, leave them at home.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.999
Okay, item last:

02:46.082 --> 02:49.460
Mr. Harry Steel from Warrior Review

02:49.544 --> 02:52.463
is here doing a profile
on our own Lieutenant Hunter

02:52.547 --> 02:55.008
as next month's "Urban Warrior."

02:55.091 --> 02:56.634
(applause)

02:56.718 --> 03:00.597
Okay. Okay, guys.
They're getting away out there.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.391
(indistinct conversations)

03:06.394 --> 03:09.981
And that was our first contact
with NVA regular.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.692
I'll tell ya, tough, disciplined troops.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.195
They could go for days
on a handful of rice,

03:15.278 --> 03:16.738
a couple of fish heads.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.822
Get out to Nam?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.949
Uh, no. I was young and stupid.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.534
I was a conscientious objector.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.411
What was your alternative service?

03:23.494 --> 03:25.371
The Oakland Zoo.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.208
But then I realized, Howard,
that the real animals are out there

03:28.291 --> 03:30.543
hijacking planes
and running wild in our streets.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.671
Zoomorphic metaphor's precise,
all my EATers really attempt

03:33.755 --> 03:36.549
is to keep the urban carnivores
away from the lambs.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.051
(laughs) Well, that must be hard,

03:38.134 --> 03:40.261
I mean, what with the teary,
liberal bed-wetters

03:40.345 --> 03:43.514
hamstringing you at every point.
I mean, no personal weapons?

03:43.598 --> 03:45.016
Well, it's not always easy.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.810
Wouldn't go to the can without mine.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.938
I would think that they
would be encouraging

03:50.021 --> 03:52.106
the use of nonlethal side arms.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.566
You tell me.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.818
Does this look like excessive force?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.612
(electricity crackling)

03:57.695 --> 03:59.197
(thud)

03:59.280 --> 04:01.658
Ugh! Ahh!

04:01.741 --> 04:04.244
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:04.327 --> 04:06.412
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:06.496 --> 04:10.250
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:20.802
(theme music plays)

05:27.577 --> 05:29.871
Because I can't concentrate like this,

05:29.954 --> 05:32.165
and I want to get
some stuff straightened out.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.835
Robin, if I could straighten
it out on the phone,

05:35.918 --> 05:37.879
I wouldn't ask you out
for lunch, now, come on.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.631
Okay. Good.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.342
Bye.

05:43.092 --> 05:44.927
WOMAN: Rodriguez, line two.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.597
-Lieutenant?
-Yes.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.683
Guy named Tim Kelly called
you about ten minutes ago.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.226
He'd like to see you at his loft.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.645
Says it's about some guy
named Tommy Joe Page.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.981
-Here's the address.
-Yeah. Um?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.110
Look, is, uh, 8:00 all right?

06:02.445 --> 06:03.988
I don't know if I can get a sitter.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.990
I knew it. You're backing out, right?

06:06.074 --> 06:08.451
I got absolutely no shot
with you, am I right?

06:08.534 --> 06:09.702
Look, I'll be honest.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.746
I'm a little nervous
about an evening with you.

06:11.829 --> 06:12.830
You blame me?

06:15.249 --> 06:16.501
Nah, I guess not.

06:17.126 --> 06:20.463
Listen, uh? (clears throat)
Why don't you think it over?

06:20.546 --> 06:23.091
I won't make any plans,
and we'll talk later.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.300
If it's yes, that's great.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.761
If it's no, uh, it's not a problem.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.096
Okay.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.018
(sighs, clears throat)

06:34.102 --> 06:36.437
Hey, Rodriguez, come on,
take a ride with me.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.189
Uh, sure.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.358
Tell him we'll come over
Sunday right after mass.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.485
I got to go.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.238
(in Spanish) I love you.

06:45.947 --> 06:46.906
Let's roll.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.325
This is real rinky-dink.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.703
I can understand you giving me a ticket,
but this is really bush league.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.705
Address, Mr. Catina?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.792
(sighs) 432 Carlton Terrace.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.961
Maybe you've never been there.
It's downtown.

07:00.044 --> 07:03.714
If you ever wanna get back down there,
maybe you ought to keep your mouth shut.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.051
Yeah, you hit a home run
on the breathalyzer: .15.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.345
Uh, excuse me. Tony Catina, right?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.097
(scoffs) You win the prize, Officer.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.932
Andrew J. Renko. What's the charge?

07:13.015 --> 07:14.976
Let's see if I can guess,
driving while intox?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.060
Man's a genius.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.438
Well, sir, your reputation sort of
precedes you,

07:18.521 --> 07:19.522
if you get my meaning.

07:19.605 --> 07:24.277
This man hit .425 in the '72 Series
and had nine RBIs.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.821
and then they won this sports car for MVP,

07:26.904 --> 07:29.657
and him and, um, Rick Rogers
and, let me see,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.367
Charlie Heckshire, right?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.328
The three musketeers put that car

07:34.412 --> 07:36.831
in the pool
at the Langston Hotel. (laughs)

07:36.914 --> 07:39.000
I've always wanted to ask you,
who was driving?

07:39.083 --> 07:41.335
Well, that was the problem.
Nobody was driving.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.671
Would've been better for you
if he'd have been driving today.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.215
Impound voucher on Mr. Catina's vehicle.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.342
Hey, champ?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.720
You just moved into the bigs.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.306
Car pound just found two OZ's
of rock in your trunk.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.600
-What?
-It's on the way to the lab.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.102
Hold the phone here, guys. It ain't mine.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.522
Sure. Carwash guy
probably left it in there.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.900
I'm telling you, it ain't mine.
Maybe you guys planted it there.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.110
My lawyer's coming down here.
You know Richard Sherman?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.154
Richard's gonna make
dog meat out of you guys.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.822
-Whoo.
-You got no right to go

08:09.906 --> 08:11.157
in a man's locked trunk!

08:12.158 --> 08:14.410
FRANK: Who's responsible for that?
Looks like water damage.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.497
Technically, the seller,
but you're getting a great price.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.707
Really, I wouldn't rock the boat, Frank.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.835
Frank, the view
from the bedroom is incredible.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.087
You can see all the way
down to the water. I like it.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340
-(telephone rings)
-Must be the bank.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.509
-Did you ask about closing costs?
-No, not yet.

08:30.259 --> 08:33.513
-I'm getting excited. (laughs)
-Hi. Fred, we approved?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.098
I don't know anything about it.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.142
I'll talk to the Furillos
and get back to you.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.563
-What's wrong?
-Well, there's a problem.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.899
You were approved for the mortgage,
but they found out

08:44.982 --> 08:48.027
you couldn't get mortgage insurance.
No insurance, no mortgage.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.238
That's ridiculous.
My medical exam was fine.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.032
I don't know what to tell you,
the Dickersons have to close this week,

08:53.115 --> 08:55.576
-and there's another offer on the table.
-Call my insurance agent.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.203
We'll have it straightened out
by tomorrow morning.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.497
Better make it end of business today.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.209
(dogs barking)

09:03.292 --> 09:04.877
Okay.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.589
There you go.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.385
Bad dog, Sniper.
Why did you run away like that?

09:12.468 --> 09:13.636
Thanks, mister.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.765
That's okay. City Hall,
room 205 for that license.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.225
You're not gonna forget, right?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.810
-Right.
-Okay.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.020
Kid's lucky.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.440
That whole cage is going
to mutt heaven tonight.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.609
I'd like to adopt some dog.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.737
All right, let's run through the procedure
with this customer.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.490
First, have him fill one of these out.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.742
Then get a five dollar fee for each dog.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.120
Uh, give him whatever he wants
on the left-side cages.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.539
I'll be up front.
Any problems, give a shout.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.583
Okay. (clears throat)

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
-Name?
-Smith.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.506
Okay, Mr. Smith, you can go ahead

09:50.590 --> 09:52.049
-and pick one out.
-That's okay.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.384
I don't wanna be any trouble.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.512
-You choose.
-You want me to pick out a dog for you?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.765
I'd like four, actually,
around? Ten pounds.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.730
You're gonna need four adoption contracts.

10:05.813 --> 10:06.856
You been here before?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.025
Me? No, not me. Never.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.110
Ever had a dog before?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.779
They all died. My kids, real sad.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.615
Sign each one of them.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.868
By signing that, you're promising
to give your animals a good home.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.786
Could you afford four dogs?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.913
Sure. I got my own business.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.041
Yeah? What kind of business?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.500
I'm a nutritionist.

10:26.584 --> 10:31.005
(dogs barking)

10:41.891 --> 10:43.225
This guy lives around here?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.978
Yeah, he's got a loft.
He gets it rent-free.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.313
Who is he?

10:47.396 --> 10:50.107
Ah, he was our key witness
against Tommy Joe Page.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.734
They used to pump gas together.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.986
-Any idea what this is about?
-I don't know.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.989
Maybe Page is sending him
threatening letters from the puzzle house.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.074
We'll find out.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.957
(coughs)

11:20.137 --> 11:21.597
Tim! Norm Buntz!

11:31.399 --> 11:32.692
Cover me from here.

11:39.281 --> 11:43.786
(suspenseful music playing)

12:09.019 --> 12:11.564
(whispering) No.
No, keep your eye on your friend.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.984
Now, the gun, throw it down.

12:18.946 --> 12:19.947
(thuds)

12:20.030 --> 12:22.074
Hi, Norman. It's me.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.749
The guns: the big one
and the Derringer on the floor.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.542
If you pull that trigger, Page,

12:31.625 --> 12:33.544
there's no way you'll leave here alive.

12:33.627 --> 12:34.628
Doesn't worry me.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.923
A sick person should always live
every minute like it was his last.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.134
(chuckles) And God knows
I'm a sick person.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.429
Incidentally, what is your name, Officer?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.140
(voice trembling) Rodriguez.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.933
Sounds pretty shaky.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.733
(gun thuds)

12:57.151 --> 12:58.152
The Derringer.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.365
(thuds)

13:08.287 --> 13:09.497
Reach into that bag.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.625
That's it. That's right.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.793
Take out a handful.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.879
I found this amazing hardware store.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.757
They had everything:
the gun, the fasteners.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.676
I got a hammer and nails.
I don't even know what for.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.388
Maybe we'll think of something.
Sit down, Norman.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.224
That nice heavy chair.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.653
I thought you'd come alone.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.781
But I like this better. (chuckles)

13:44.949 --> 13:47.201
I think we have
very interesting situation here.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.244
Yeah?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.871
Well, you enjoy it while you can.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.586
Well, Norman, since you put me in,
are you disappointed to see me out?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.422
I always thought putting you in
was a bad idea, Page.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.133
-I had other plans for you.
-I'll bet you did.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.928
I learned a lot in the hospital.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.222
I learned to do
what people wanted me to do.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.057
I was a model resident.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.976
Eventually they had to give me privileges.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.310
Which you took advantage of.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.606
That's why I'm here, Norman. Hungry?

14:18.816 --> 14:19.942
Uh-uh.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.570
Tim kept a full fridge.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.904
It's all ours.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.074
I mean, he won't be hungry.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.910
-How'd he take it?
-He cried.

14:30.953 --> 14:31.954
And you liked that.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.873
Can't change what we are, Norman.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.667
This place has big closets.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.754
That's where I stashed him.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.301
<i>Olé!</i>

14:47.803 --> 14:49.305
(chuckling)

14:51.557 --> 14:53.475
That's where I'm gonna stash you, Norman.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.144
You look smaller, Page.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.607
-Smaller?
-Yeah, like you're shrinking.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.525
(chuckles)

15:07.281 --> 15:09.742
You know, for hours in court,
I used to stare at you, Norman.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.660
And I think I know
why you dress like that.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.578
Mmm?

15:13.370 --> 15:17.958
Are you colorblind? (laughs)

15:18.042 --> 15:21.587
(dry chuckle) I don't know.
I'll have it checked, alright.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.672
I don't think you'll have
a chance to do that.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.007
Heh.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.258
Oh.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.099
Wouldn't you agree
this situation's hopeless?

15:34.892 --> 15:38.187
Do you want money?
Just tell us what you want.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.857
(laughing) He thinks he's a hostage.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.776
No. I don't want money.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.445
He's a squeak, Rodriguez. He's nothing.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.529
Just stare him down.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.490
He'll slip through the cracks
in the floor.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.993
-(chuckles)
-Are you challenging me, Norman?

15:53.077 --> 15:55.204
Go on, Rodriguez. Tell him he's a maggot.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.336
You filthy maggot.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.630
It won't work, Norman.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.590
I haven't even started,
and he's terrified.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.218
-Maggot!
-That's right. There you go, huh?

16:09.301 --> 16:10.928
You like that? You hear that, Page?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.137
Maggot!

16:12.221 --> 16:15.516
(chuckles)

16:15.599 --> 16:18.602
Yes, I heard your expression of anger.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.396
Let me just ask you something.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.732
Later on, when hours have passed

16:23.816 --> 16:25.651
and your wife puts dinner in the oven

16:25.734 --> 16:27.569
because you haven't come home,

16:27.653 --> 16:30.030
and she sits and waits and worries,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.950
do you think there's even
a remote possibility

16:33.033 --> 16:34.535
you'll still be alive?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.537
Just a yes or no answer.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.794
Yes.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.172
Yes, and you'll be dead.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.134
I'm not convinced. Are you, Norman?

16:50.217 --> 16:52.011
(chuckles)

16:52.094 --> 16:53.637
TONY: Give me a break, Richard.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.931
RICHARD: The break was my coming up here.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.933
I am suing you for the 25 grand you--

16:58.017 --> 17:00.352
How d'you expect to collect
if I'm sitting in Harrisonville?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.563
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I will write you a check.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.940
Sorry, Tony, my office
doesn't need repapering.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.483
-You unethical scum!
-Oh,

17:06.567 --> 17:09.486
Save that team spirit rap
for the sports writers, Tony.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.321
You forget I know you.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.656
All right, I'll give you that.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.617
I'm no apple pie,
but this ain't right, I'm innocent.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.579
Well, you'll have a chance
to convince 12 of your peers of that fact.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.956
You see, I understand
the public defender's office

17:21.040 --> 17:23.876
has experience in that area.
Get the man a PD.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.046
I don't want a public defender,
I want the best lawyer that money can buy!

17:27.129 --> 17:30.049
-PD is the best he can buy.
-You button-down creep.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.468
What about the chicks, Richard?
Who got you all the girls?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.887
Bimbos, Tony! Third-rate bleached blondes.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.889
But it was fun for a time.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.600
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

17:39.683 --> 17:42.061
Hold it! Sit down!

17:43.020 --> 17:46.065
I'm telling you guys. It ain't mine.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.650
Well, my man, if you are clean,
why don't you tell us about it.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.736
-About what?
-About your dealer, for one.

17:50.819 --> 17:54.490
Do I have to connect the dots for you?
I ain't got no dealer!

17:54.573 --> 17:56.658
I loaned my car to a friend
while I'm in Florida.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.536
I get back, I pick it up, I get tanked,
you guys nail me for speeding,

17:59.620 --> 18:02.331
and the next thing you know,
I'm public enemy number one around here!

18:02.414 --> 18:04.041
Okay, okay, okay, who's your friend?

18:04.666 --> 18:06.710
That's how it works around here, huh?

18:06.794 --> 18:09.838
I gotta give up my two
best pals to walk on this thing?

18:09.922 --> 18:13.300
Let me tell you goons something.
That totally stinks! You understand me?

18:13.383 --> 18:14.885
You still got the other option open, baby.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.970
-What option?
-Do the time.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.847
Tony Catina...

18:18.931 --> 18:23.102
'72 Series. The three musketeers.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.687
-You a lawyer?
-Chief of Police Daniels.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.191
Chief, listen, you gotta help me out.
These two guys here are flaking me.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.903
-I gotta be in Cleveland tonight.
-We got resale-weight cocaine

18:32.986 --> 18:34.154
on Mr. Catina, Chief.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.615
I'm sure whatever the problem, Mr. Catina,

18:36.698 --> 18:39.493
you'll receive the fairest possible
treatment from these men.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.539
I wasn't expecting you.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.834
I'm here to have
my picture taken with Howard

18:46.917 --> 18:48.836
-for some magazine.
-I'm sure he appreciates the effort.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.755
Always try to accommodate
my loyal officers.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.299
And what can I do for you?

18:54.925 --> 18:58.262
Nothing, but it occurs to me to ask
how you're handling Mr. Catina.

18:58.345 --> 19:02.224
By the book. Low-key,
just like any other first-time offender.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.186
More sniveling homilies
from the Marshal Pétain of Hill Street.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.564
What a penchant you have
for pursuing the innocent

19:08.647 --> 19:09.982
and slacking off on the guilty.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.735
Tie Mr. Catina up
in his own brown jockstrap,

19:13.819 --> 19:16.238
and this department hits
a home run against traffickers,

19:16.321 --> 19:17.739
no matter who they are.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.783
We'll get public affairs up to speed.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.201
This has a lot of ink.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.953
We're not ready to arraign, Chief.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.455
There's some question
as to the possession.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.832
Resolve it.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.709
And keep my office informed.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.880
Good morning.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.304
What in God's name is going on, Mr. Eeley.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.306
I pay my bills. I passed the physical.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.641
I have a regular job, so does my wife,

19:44.725 --> 19:47.519
and we got turned down for insurance
so we can't buy an apartment.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.521
We would have been happy
to write your policy.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.772
What?

19:50.856 --> 19:54.359
But your application fell
outside our policy profile.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.611
Mr. Eeley...

19:58.113 --> 20:00.991
I'm becoming quite angry.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.035
Bad IFF report.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.411
What's an IFF?

20:04.494 --> 20:06.371
Insurance fact finders.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.208
It's like an insurance
credit-check company.

20:09.291 --> 20:13.003
They go around and ask your neighbors
if you beat your wife or sell dope.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.379
And what do I supposedly do?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.089
Oh, I have no idea.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.842
We don't actually get to see their files.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.928
They just issue a yes
or no recommendation.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.596
Which your company blindly follows.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.890
Pretty much everybody I know does.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.602
Whom do I contact at IFF?

20:28.685 --> 20:31.438
Um, they've got a district office.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.275
Try Martin Sallow.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.654
My editor was counting on
20 tons of steel, Howard,

20:38.737 --> 20:40.405
not eight ounces of plastic.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.658
If you could have given me
more than a week's notice,

20:42.741 --> 20:45.994
I could have had everything reassembled
and polished up for you.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.079
It was my fault.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.749
I was just operating under the assumption
that the dragon would be battle-ready.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.334
I just never thought to inquire.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.544
-It's okay, Lieutenant.
-Just as long as you know

20:54.628 --> 20:56.546
<i>we</i> are probably going to lose the cover.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.008
Okay, into the lens, please, and...

21:00.092 --> 21:01.718
(camera shutter clicks)

21:01.802 --> 21:03.762
-That's passable.
-(shutter clicks)

21:03.845 --> 21:05.013
Nice. Alright. Again.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.682
-(shutter clicks)
-Okay.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.394
I'd like to get a couple
of Chief Daniels holding the facsimile.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.229
Me, in the middle with the toy?

21:12.312 --> 21:13.814
It's not a toy, Chief.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.358
It's an absolutely accurate scale model,

21:16.441 --> 21:18.026
right down to the paint job.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.530
Even the battering ram is to regulation,
and see here?

21:21.613 --> 21:23.448
The tread's genuine rubber.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.242
And read the lettering.

21:25.325 --> 21:29.288
-"Fletcher Daniels, Chief of Police."
-Let's get it over with, Lieutenant.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.747
Thank you, Chief.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.083
That's lovely.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.252
I got the plane tickets.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.421
I got the credit-card receipts.
I got all that stuff.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.257
Doesn't that prove I have been
in Fort Lauderdale all week?

21:40.340 --> 21:42.634
They'll maintain you brought
the drugs back with you.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.928
Or that the bag was in the trunk
before you left.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.931
What about that? What about the trunk?
They got no right to go in a locked trunk.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.309
Wrong. On impound,
they voucher for safekeeping.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.311
I thought you were here to help me out.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.188
If we can show that the person
who borrowed your car

21:55.272 --> 21:57.607
was a known cocaine user,
we might, on the basis of that,

21:57.691 --> 21:59.860
be able to establish
a climate of reasonable doubt.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.362
-What would that mean?
-It's a chance.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.698
We'd have an issue to argue at trial,
not much of one.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.950
Cutting through all the crap,
what you're saying is

22:07.034 --> 22:09.411
I gotta rat these guys out
or I'm finished, right?

22:09.494 --> 22:11.997
It's your word against theirs.
The cocaine was found in your car.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.166
I gotta set them up and then rat them out?

22:14.249 --> 22:17.586
I'm saying that because of who you are,
you won't get probation,

22:17.669 --> 22:20.213
-the chief won't allow it.
-The Chief of Police?

22:20.297 --> 22:22.799
He almost asked me
for a signed ball just now.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.302
Damn.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.720
Damn!

22:30.474 --> 22:31.558
(inhales deeply)

22:31.641 --> 22:32.809
Yeah.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.354
Okay.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.940
I think I can get them to cop to it.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.320
(indistinct conversations)

22:48.909 --> 22:51.953
-Mick?
-What?

22:53.121 --> 22:54.122
What was so urgent?

22:59.419 --> 23:00.253
I love you.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.050
I love you, and this morning,

23:05.133 --> 23:07.094
you didn't even say goodbye
to me when you left.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.555
And ever since the day
you got kicked in the face

23:10.639 --> 23:12.432
and I saw you in the emergency room,

23:12.516 --> 23:14.684
I have felt very far away from you.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.524
I'm sorry for the things I said then,

23:21.400 --> 23:23.819
about you and the baby, I'm very sorry.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.075
I'm sorry I slapped you.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.619
You know how much I love you?

23:33.870 --> 23:38.458
Sometimes I think if we die,
we could still be together.

23:43.296 --> 23:46.550
Look at this crappy stuff.
This strayed from a pushcart!

23:46.633 --> 23:49.052
He wants you to beg. Don't give him that.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.512
Don't beg him or you're dead.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.097
He's going to kill us.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.391
He's a worm. I'll eat this guy.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.935
Every minute we stay alive,
our odds improve.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.062
-You just fight him.
-What odds?

24:00.147 --> 24:02.774
-We're history.
-Not me, Rodriguez.

24:04.985 --> 24:08.738
So, I guess you've had
a little pep talk, huh?

24:08.822 --> 24:12.159
I was just telling Detective Rodriguez
what a brave guy you were.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.660
Seven murders.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.079
Three women, a ten-year-old boy,
an elderly couple--

24:16.163 --> 24:19.332
You can try to make me angry,
Norman, but it won't work.

24:19.416 --> 24:23.253
I'm in too good a mood!
I've had five restful years.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.963
They give you a lot of drugs?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.174
I was occasionally sedated.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.259
(chuckles) Dulled your edges, Page.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.761
-You're not sharp anymore.
-How's that?

24:31.845 --> 24:34.139
My car. It's sitting right out there.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.432
That's sloppy.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.560
This is not gonna take that long.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.687
It won't be a problem.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.855
Don't count on it.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.817
You know, sometimes working under pressure
brings out the best in a man.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.902
(chuckles)

24:47.819 --> 24:49.154
You've had your fun.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.449
Now it's time for mine.

24:54.784 --> 24:57.370
(chuckles)

25:07.631 --> 25:09.799
For example, I don't have to kill you.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.558
I could blow your face away.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.061
Don't beg him, Rodriguez.
Don't beg him. He's nothing.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.979
(crying) Oh, God.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.357
Don't beg him. He's nothing.

25:26.066 --> 25:30.487
Oh, God. No. Please. Please don't.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.740
-Don't beg him, Rodriguez.
-I beg you, please. Don't kill me.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.283
(sobbing) Please, please!

25:35.367 --> 25:36.535
There it is.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.288
He said the magic words.

25:41.498 --> 25:44.292
(gunshot)

25:47.504 --> 25:49.506
You got three goats in one year.

25:49.589 --> 25:52.759
See, now I gotta verify
whether these other goats

25:52.842 --> 25:55.053
are doing well in their adoptive homes.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.930
(Jamaican accent) I have a picture.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.599
(dogs barking)

26:01.184 --> 26:02.769
This is you with the robes on?

26:02.852 --> 26:04.145
These goats don't look happy.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.524
Well, that is the way
a goat looks when he's happy!

26:08.066 --> 26:09.317
You got a polaroid?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.236
-Camera?
-Yeah.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.990
Go home, get today's paper.
Hold it up like this.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.867
Get me a picture of the goats
with today's headline.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.452
Like kidnappers do.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.037
Give me the damn goat, man.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.831
Stop this nonsense!

26:22.914 --> 26:26.793
Listen, barn breath.
No damn picture, no damn goat.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.044
MAN: I want a police dog!

26:28.128 --> 26:31.548
A mean one! One of them Dobermans.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.926
Mike, why don't you take 15?

26:35.010 --> 26:37.971
Go, uh, have some coffee.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.223
What about my Doberman?

26:40.307 --> 26:41.641
I'll take it.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.602
A mean one.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.730
(dogs barking)

27:22.724 --> 27:24.476
TOMMY: I didn't mind the hospital.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.770
In fact, there's only one thing in my life

27:26.853 --> 27:28.605
worth the effort of getting out…

27:28.688 --> 27:30.273
you.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.983
You were very special.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.612
Oh, the things I dreamed of doing to you.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.156
-What? Am I supposed to be flattered?
-You're good.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.824
You got a hell of an act,

27:40.617 --> 27:42.077
but I could make you hurt so bad.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.537
You're getting yourself excited
over nothing, Page.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.790
-It's never gonna work.
-It worked on him.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.833
(chair clatters)

27:49.542 --> 27:52.545
-You heard him beg.
-I heard you beg. Remember?

27:52.629 --> 27:55.090
I made you get down on your knees.

27:55.715 --> 27:59.010
I pressed my gun against
the back of your skull. (chuckles)

27:59.094 --> 28:02.055
You were begging me
in that tiny, little voice of yours,

28:02.138 --> 28:05.058
"Please, don't kill me. Please. I'm sick."

28:05.141 --> 28:06.309
Stop!

28:09.813 --> 28:11.981
Now why don't you tell me
that didn't hurt?

28:13.191 --> 28:15.485
Yeah, it hurt. What of it?

28:17.404 --> 28:19.739
(laughs) You still got the itch, huh?

28:19.823 --> 28:22.325
Still the long sleeves
to cover up them sores.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.326
It's nasty.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.747
What's that disease called?

28:27.831 --> 28:28.957
I could burn you in here.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.583
Yeah, and then what?

28:30.667 --> 28:33.044
You'd run away,
and you'd hear me laughing at you.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.671
(laughs)

28:34.754 --> 28:36.881
Hey, that's what you heard
in the hospital, wasn't it, huh?

28:36.965 --> 28:39.592
You heard me laughing. (laughs)

28:39.676 --> 28:41.970
Like in court, when they
played those tapes, huh?

28:42.053 --> 28:44.764
(chuckling) You remember? You were crying.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.391
Talking like a little boy.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.101
Telling how your old man used to--

28:48.184 --> 28:50.186
-Stop it! Stop!
-(laughs)

28:50.270 --> 28:53.523
And I was laughing!
Oh-ho, I thought it was funny.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.275
(laughs)

28:56.735 --> 29:00.447
See? I know what this means to you, Page.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.490
And there's no relief, is there?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.826
Not unless you can put me where I had you.

29:05.452 --> 29:09.789
-That's gonna happen right now!
-(laughs) Not a chance.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.500
No? You've inspired me.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.086
It's time to get more creative.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.547
Time? You don't have time.
Remember the car? Huh?

29:17.630 --> 29:20.133
You're gonna lose this,
Page, because you're sloppy.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.052
There's nobody there.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.637
(laughs)

29:24.721 --> 29:25.930
Shut up!

29:35.607 --> 29:37.942
Police officer. Who's in charge here?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.110
I'm Dr. Morton.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.112
I'm in charge of this facility.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.655
What do you got in the van, doc?

29:42.739 --> 29:44.240
What do you mean, what's in the van?

29:44.324 --> 29:47.243
I mean are you using
those dogs for lab experiments?

29:47.327 --> 29:49.078
Dogs?

29:49.162 --> 29:52.040
-(dogs barking)
-Dogs! Dogs! (growls)

29:52.123 --> 29:54.709
You're under arrest.
Turn around, both of you.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.753
Put your hands on the van.
Spread your legs.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.507
(telephone ringing)

30:00.590 --> 30:02.217
Hey, Lieutenant Buntz around?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.593
Out since this morning.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.221
Well, I been sitting
in the Mahjong Moon for two hours

30:06.304 --> 30:07.806
over a plate of cold goulash.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.099
-We had a sit-down.
-What can I tell you?

30:10.183 --> 30:12.310
Well, you can tell Lieutenant Buntz

30:12.393 --> 30:14.646
I ain't a guy to be
treated like a fiancée.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.690
And he owes me nine bucks
for chicken paprikash.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.234
I'll see that he gets the message.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.401
Do.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.363
Thousands of people are dying
of arteriosclerosis every year

30:23.446 --> 30:25.824
but you'd rather gas those mutts
than to permit me

30:25.907 --> 30:28.576
to do fundamental, grant-level research.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.329
-Those dogs are for pets.
-They're dogs!

30:31.412 --> 30:34.582
You go to a supply house, it's $35.
This way it's cheaper.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.043
There's money for more important things.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.087
Maybe you'll remember that
when your arteries

30:39.170 --> 30:41.047
are the consistency of uncooked spaghetti.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.300
You pay Weaver for these dogs?

30:44.384 --> 30:46.427
What do you think?
He gives them to me for free?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.555
Hold both of them. I'll be back later.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.432
Whose is it? Which one?
Rogers or Heckshire?

30:51.516 --> 30:53.935
I told you, they've been buying
together for years.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.854
-Which one you give the car to?
-Charlie.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.856
You talk to them about
their missing possessions?

30:57.939 --> 31:00.483
-You call them up?
-You busted me before I could go to sleep.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.402
Mr. Catina would like to call
and set up a meeting

31:02.485 --> 31:04.362
with Mr. Rogers and Mr. Heckshire.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.613
Captain?

31:07.282 --> 31:08.283
Make your call.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.789
These are old roommates of Mr. Catina's,

31:14.873 --> 31:17.333
so you'll understand if this
is a little hard for him.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.003
Hey, Charlie, what's happening?

31:20.086 --> 31:21.796
Of course I was the one
that picked up the car.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.464
You didn't report it stolen, did you?

31:24.173 --> 31:27.302
What? You got some laundry
in the trunk? No problem.

31:27.385 --> 31:31.723
Listen, why don't you and the Rick Man
meet me at the Stadium Tavern at 6:00?

31:31.806 --> 31:34.309
(chuckles) Solid.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.104
Now, what does that sound like to you?

31:38.187 --> 31:39.480
Snow white?

31:39.564 --> 31:42.191
J.D., be sure to keep
a blanket on the press.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.943
Yeah, loose lips sink ships.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.487
Oh, Tony seemed real upset, Ms. Davenport.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.865
Any word on the apartment?

31:48.948 --> 31:50.199
Guy was supposed to be here.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.453
Captain. Captain,
we got a Mr. Sallow waiting.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.955
Oh, good. Show him into my office.
You got five minutes?

31:56.039 --> 31:58.166
-Yeah, sure.
-One more thing.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.292
Maybe it's nothing,

31:59.375 --> 32:01.294
but we just got a call
from Hill and Renko.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.421
They spotted Lieutenant Buntz's sedan

32:03.504 --> 32:05.882
over near those abandoned
buildings on Van Meer.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.425
-And?
-Well, they say it was there

32:07.508 --> 32:09.218
on their last pass-by a couple hours ago.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.221
The lieutenant's snitch came in
and said he was supposed to have lunch

32:12.305 --> 32:14.265
with the lieutenant,
and Norman never showed.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.684
-Was Norm alone?
-No, he took Rodriguez with him.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.227
Hill and Renko are looking around.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.812
-Tell them to be careful.
-Yes, sir.

32:20.813 --> 32:23.066
I'm gonna be released,
and this gets totally dropped.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.944
Only if it works, my man.
See, it's just like your batting average.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.487
A long fly ball is still an out.

32:29.113 --> 32:32.116
Captain Furillo,
I can't actually show you the file itself.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.494
-Why is that?
-Well, obviously,

32:34.577 --> 32:37.121
we have to protect
our confidential sources.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.456
Those sources being?

32:39.207 --> 32:41.751
Neighbors, friends, business associates.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.212
In other words,
completely unsubstantiated material.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.924
-We just gather facts, Captain.
-What do those sources reveal about me?

32:48.007 --> 32:49.133
You must know.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.553
Does this have anything to do
with my being an alcoholic?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.389
Oh, no, no. That's fine.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.140
You haven't fallen off
the wagon, have you?

32:58.518 --> 33:01.396
No, this concerns
your illness ten years ago.

33:01.479 --> 33:05.274
-What illness?
-Come on, Captain. Your cancer.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.902
-I never had cancer.
-You've never had leukemia?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.738
-Not to my knowledge.
-This isn't a joke, Captain.

33:10.822 --> 33:14.158
-Believe me, I'm not laughing.
-But our field investigator verified it.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.494
Well, I suggest you find
your field investigator

33:16.577 --> 33:17.954
and get this thing cleared up.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.623
I think that's
a very good idea, Mr. Sallow.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.919
Well, he might be out of the office.
Can I use the phone?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.675
Does this sort of thing happen often?

33:30.758 --> 33:34.137
No. Very rarely. As a matter of fact,
hardly anybody knows about us.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.556
Well, I certainly didn't.
I find it appalling.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.350
I'm going to film
for your medical records, Frank.

33:40.768 --> 33:43.438
Marty, here. Get me Campanis.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.191
You're probably gonna have
to come downtown, Captain.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.652
And you may want to phone
your insurance guy as well.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.779
What were the other names?

33:52.822 --> 33:55.241
No. No.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.494
No. Spell that.

33:59.620 --> 34:06.419
C-A-R-I-L-L-O.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.588
That must be the guy.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.007
Okay.

34:12.300 --> 34:16.137
I, uh, must have gotten
the two reports mixed up.

34:16.220 --> 34:19.766
This Carillo dude
had leukemia ten years ago.

34:19.849 --> 34:23.144
So, if your doctor says you never had it,

34:23.227 --> 34:24.228
I guess you didn't.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.730
It's unbelievable.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.106
Hey, man.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.608
I'm sorry.

34:28.691 --> 34:31.736
I got a quota. Ten investigations a day.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.906
I know cops never arrest
the wrong guy, right?

34:34.989 --> 34:37.075
Very competent work, Mr. Sallow.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.119
Would you call the bank
and get this straightened out?

34:40.203 --> 34:42.413
Uh, well, um?

34:42.497 --> 34:44.999
Uh, well, I can start the paperwork.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.918
-What paperwork?
-I did a little checking.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.795
Once a bad IFF's filed,

34:48.878 --> 34:50.588
let's assume it's out of their computer,

34:50.671 --> 34:52.799
it's still gotta get out
of our exchange computer,

34:52.882 --> 34:55.051
and then the explanation's
gotta be inserted

34:55.134 --> 34:56.427
into the applicant's file.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.138
-How long?
-60 days would be standard.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.516
Expedited, maybe 20?

35:01.599 --> 35:04.977
So this unqualified jerk
working for an untouchable company

35:05.061 --> 35:06.229
cost me a condo.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.900
What about paying cash?

35:13.402 --> 35:14.821
Twenty minutes for one building?

35:14.904 --> 35:16.781
And it'll be dark
in another couple of hours.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.283
Think we ought to call for some
more manpower down here?

35:19.367 --> 35:21.661
What do you think Buntz
is doing down here anyway?

35:21.744 --> 35:25.540
I don't know, but if it's romance,
he's got zero sense of atmosphere.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.471
They're gone.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.516
Maybe they think you have
a woman who lives here.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.518
Yeah.

35:45.601 --> 35:48.146
Yeah, you're the kind of cop
who'd have a mistress, right?

35:48.229 --> 35:50.857
Not your area of expertise, is it?

35:50.940 --> 35:53.109
I've had women. Remember?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.778
At the trial, you heard all the details.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.324
They're coming back. You know that, Tommy.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.576
Unless I move the car.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.036
-Better get going.
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.913
And give a guy like you a chance?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.499
(laughing) Try to chew yourself free.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.087
I've got a remedy for that.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.219
You know, when you got me, Norman,

36:20.303 --> 36:22.096
the press made a big thing of it.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.266
One article even called you a savior.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.810
So this isn't really out of line.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.520
It won't change things.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.275
When you feel this nail being
driven through your wrist

36:34.358 --> 36:36.068
you may have a whole different attitude.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.237
And if one doesn't work...

36:39.197 --> 36:41.532
-I've got a whole boxful.
-(nails rattling)

36:41.616 --> 36:43.868
You don't have time.
You didn't move the car.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.496
Look at your hands shake.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.207
You see, you're falling apart here.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.083
Now look at my hands.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.085
Nothing's changed, has it?

36:53.669 --> 36:56.380
You're still the little worm
that begged me for his life.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.759
What's the matter?
You don't want me to see it?

37:00.301 --> 37:04.388
(laughs) I don't need to see it,
I can smell it. What's that?

37:04.472 --> 37:06.641
-What?
-I thought I heard a car door slam.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.851
They're back. (laughs)

37:10.144 --> 37:11.896
There's no one there. No one!

37:12.480 --> 37:14.148
So I was wrong, huh?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.609
But they are coming. We both know that.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.281
Not if I move the car.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.617
(laughs)

37:27.995 --> 37:29.997
Nice and tight.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.885
Hey...

37:43.427 --> 37:44.971
Didn't you forget something?

37:58.526 --> 38:01.070
(footsteps)

38:03.322 --> 38:05.950
(straining)

38:10.955 --> 38:13.833
(dogs barking)

38:13.916 --> 38:15.418
Where's Weaver?

38:15.501 --> 38:17.753
In the back, by the decompressor.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.219
WEAVER: Where you been?

38:25.303 --> 38:28.514
I tell you it'll take 15 minutes,
you're gone three and a half hours!

38:28.597 --> 38:30.558
Leave the dog alone. You're under arrest.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.018
You a cop?

38:32.101 --> 38:34.437
Bribe-taking, misuse of office.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.896
What's the matter with you?

38:35.980 --> 38:38.149
You some kind of animal-rights
crazy or something?

38:38.232 --> 38:40.609
-Turn around!
-Oh, boy.

38:48.534 --> 38:49.744
Norman?

38:49.827 --> 38:51.203
(panting)

38:57.835 --> 38:59.587
All right, men, disperse in pairs.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.006
Check each building one floor at a time.

39:04.550 --> 39:05.760
Howard,

39:05.843 --> 39:08.637
if there's any way I could be
a working part of this--

39:08.721 --> 39:11.724
Well, your offer is understood
and appreciated, Harry,

39:11.807 --> 39:14.018
but we're just at
the reconnaissance phase.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.686
-Roger.
-Hoo!

39:16.354 --> 39:20.274
(breathing heavily)

39:20.358 --> 39:22.068
I know you're there, Norman.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.904
(screams)

39:31.452 --> 39:32.661
I got guns.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.373
I could just start shooting around.
I'd hit you!

39:35.998 --> 39:37.792
I'd kill you, Norman, just like that!

39:37.875 --> 39:39.627
But I'm trying to give you this chance.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.385
Maybe I was wrong.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.095
Maybe you're not here, Norman.

39:58.145 --> 39:59.605
You're trying to make me beg.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.233
Well, it's not gonna happen.

40:03.317 --> 40:06.737
See, they'll take me back to the hospital.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.365
(laughing) It's easy for me.

40:11.450 --> 40:12.743
Lieutenant.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.579
(camera shutter clicking)

40:16.080 --> 40:19.083
Hey! I'm up here!

40:19.166 --> 40:22.002
Just let me finish a little business,
and I'll be ready to come back.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.838
(yells)

40:26.882 --> 40:28.843
(shutter clicking)

40:31.053 --> 40:32.096
Damn.

40:32.179 --> 40:35.307
(dramatic music playing)

40:35.391 --> 40:39.812
MAN: Also dead at the scene,
Tommy Joe Page, male Caucasian.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.481
-MAN 2: Request permission for body--
-Is he alive?

40:42.565 --> 40:45.401
Everything's shattered from the skull
to the base of the spine.

40:54.618 --> 40:57.246
TONY (on radio): <i>What say</i>
<i>I call up some stews and we have a party</i>

40:57.329 --> 40:58.914
<i>at my house tomorrow night? (laughs)</i>

40:58.998 --> 41:00.875
MAN: <i>Still trying to get me</i>
<i>in trouble, Tony?</i>

41:00.958 --> 41:03.419
<i>-You know I don't fool around.</i>
-TONY: <i>Claire, as pregnant as she is,</i>

41:03.502 --> 41:05.504
<i>I thought you take on</i>
<i>another squeeze right now.</i>

41:05.588 --> 41:08.007
Man, some days
this job really don't make it.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.383
Maybe they won't bite.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.885
MAN: <i>Thought you would be in Cleveland.</i>

41:10.968 --> 41:12.803
Tell you the truth,
I got a little juiced...

41:13.512 --> 41:14.555
Missed the plane.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.056
(laughing)

41:16.140 --> 41:17.808
You guys want your laundry, don't you?

41:19.435 --> 41:21.562
I almost forgot,
I talked to Richard today.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.022
Yeah, what'd he say?

41:23.105 --> 41:25.316
Said he was going to Jamaica,
gonna take a little R&amp;R.

41:25.399 --> 41:27.818
He wouldn't be able to get on
that lease till after the 1st.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.153
Guy works too hard.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.280
Stealing people's money will wear you out.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.531
Yeah. Hey?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.492
You got something else of mine in there?

41:35.451 --> 41:36.702
What? I don't see anything.

41:36.785 --> 41:40.331
Hey, man. It's not there. What the hell?

41:40.414 --> 41:41.749
Okay, Tony, where's our stuff?

41:41.832 --> 41:44.168
Ricky, you're getting so wasted,
you're losing your digits.

41:44.251 --> 41:47.338
-It's under the wheel well.
-(sighs) Damn. Let's get them.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.592
(siren wails)

41:53.135 --> 41:54.512
I wonder what that could be.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.682
We were gonna have it out last night,
but you got home early.

41:58.766 --> 41:59.892
You should have called me.

41:59.975 --> 42:02.144
It scared me
when I saw the car wasn't there.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.313
I cannot believe you guys
would leave that in my car.

42:04.396 --> 42:06.023
(laughing) Some pals, right?

42:06.106 --> 42:08.400
Mr. Innocent, only reason you're ticked

42:08.484 --> 42:11.111
is you didn't scarf up
a couple of grams for yourself.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.285
J.D.: Police! Freeze! You're under arrest!

42:18.869 --> 42:20.496
You bastard!

42:20.579 --> 42:22.039
All right, come on! That's enough!

42:22.122 --> 42:25.209
What'd you expect me to do,
take the fall for you two pinheads?

42:25.751 --> 42:28.546
That's lame.
You didn't have to rat us out.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.131
MAN: Come on, pal. This way.
Make it easy on yourself.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.883
Hey, you guys. Hey, hey.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.262
Let's go inside and have a drink.
I got a million friends in there.

42:36.345 --> 42:37.596
Pass.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.391
Oh, I get it. Now I'm the bad guy, right?

42:40.474 --> 42:42.184
Why don't the two of you
take a look in the mirror

42:42.268 --> 42:44.228
when you're cutting your faces
in the morning?

42:44.311 --> 42:46.605
-(car doors close)
-(car engine starts)

42:48.691 --> 42:50.734
So he held them both for a couple of hours

42:50.818 --> 42:53.946
and then Page just pumped him
in cold blood.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.741
Norm, I just heard. Are you all right?

42:57.825 --> 42:58.993
I'm breathing.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.370
(clears throat) Look, uh, Captain...

43:05.332 --> 43:07.876
Look, I know this is your area, but, uh...

43:07.960 --> 43:11.797
I thought I might go by
and see Mrs. Rodriguez.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.801
I just want her to know that
he stood up there and he didn't flinch.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.511
He was an honor to the badge.

43:18.053 --> 43:19.930
I'm sure she'd appreciate hearing that.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.350
Yeah, well, it's a lie,
but at least it's something.

43:32.526 --> 43:33.819
Not tonight, okay?

43:35.362 --> 43:36.488
No problem.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.995
Boy, some stones this guy's carrying, huh?

43:43.078 --> 43:46.498
I expect nothing less
from a veteran and skilled officer.

43:46.582 --> 43:49.752
Well, that's not to say that you
and your EATers weren't magnificent.

43:49.835 --> 43:52.296
I doubt that the Rangers could
have done any better.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.214
(laughs) That's high praise indeed.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.592
I'm telling you, though,
the sight of that murderer

43:56.675 --> 43:59.136
-hurtling through that window--
-Yes.

44:00.846 --> 44:02.348
what I'm suggesting, Howard, is,

44:02.431 --> 44:04.099
and I think that my editor will demand

44:04.183 --> 44:07.269
that we make some adjustment here because

44:07.353 --> 44:10.856
we kind of missed on the tank,
and I got the other on film.

44:10.939 --> 44:13.734
So I'm gonna propose that
we designate Norman Buntz

44:13.817 --> 44:15.069
as our "Warrior of the Month."

44:17.905 --> 44:21.116
Of course. (clears throat)
Excellent choice.

44:27.247 --> 44:30.084
(vomiting)

44:36.131 --> 44:37.132
(spits)

44:38.384 --> 44:40.469
(toilet flushes)

44:41.345 --> 44:43.764
(breathing heavily)

44:50.854 --> 44:52.272
Heard it was pretty rough.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.775
(exhales)

44:54.858 --> 44:58.278
Yeah, well, it wasn't tea
with the freaking Queen.

45:00.864 --> 45:01.907
You okay?

45:02.616 --> 45:03.826
(exhales)

45:04.743 --> 45:06.328
I'm, I'm better.

45:09.164 --> 45:10.416
(coughs)

45:12.209 --> 45:13.544
Whew.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.217
Robin?

45:20.759 --> 45:23.846
I'm sending 20 bucks
to that animal charity.

45:27.516 --> 45:28.600
Mick?

45:30.269 --> 45:33.313
Oh, something's not right.
I'm bleeding a little.

45:35.274 --> 45:36.358
Let's call a doctor.

45:38.110 --> 45:42.281
Hmph. But then I asked myself,
why are you upset?

45:42.906 --> 45:45.993
You joined the department to serve,
not to become a...

45:46.702 --> 45:48.287
a media personality.

45:49.830 --> 45:53.459
But I know that that motive is honest.

45:54.376 --> 45:56.462
And dare I say it, selfless.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.423
Hmph.

46:00.591 --> 46:04.219
I suppose that my frustration
stems from my own weakness,

46:04.303 --> 46:06.847
my own inability

46:06.930 --> 46:10.225
to stifle the feelings
of envy and resentment.

46:12.311 --> 46:15.522
Not toward Norman Buntz, but towards...

46:17.691 --> 46:19.151
Harry Steel...

46:20.527 --> 46:22.112
and the Warrior Review,

46:23.781 --> 46:26.950
who took me up to the mountaintop,

46:28.494 --> 46:32.122
and cast me down
from those Olympian heights.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.834
It's an absolute disgrace.

46:35.918 --> 46:38.337
And anyway, that magazine is terrible.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.756
It hasn't been good for years.

46:40.839 --> 46:45.093
Oh, God, what a woman you are,
Ms. Ashton-Wilkes.

46:46.845 --> 46:49.765
I'm canceling my subscription
in the morning.

46:49.848 --> 46:51.934
(both laughing)

46:57.523 --> 46:58.941
Mr. Belker?

46:59.024 --> 47:00.526
Would you like to come with me?

47:00.609 --> 47:02.069
(someone coughs)

47:04.696 --> 47:06.573
Doctor, what's going on?

47:06.657 --> 47:08.033
Your baby's still alive.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.251
As you can see,

47:18.460 --> 47:22.422
there appears to be
a small fibroid tumor <i>here.</i>

47:22.506 --> 47:24.341
And that could be
the cause of the bleeding.

47:24.925 --> 47:27.302
And <i>here</i> is another.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.346
Now, it's too soon to tell whether or not

47:29.429 --> 47:31.473
you will spontaneously abort,
Ms. Tataglia,

47:32.099 --> 47:33.308
but I would advise bed rest

47:33.392 --> 47:36.019
for at least the next 72 hours,
in any event.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.980
What is that thing that's moving there?

47:38.063 --> 47:39.273
-That?
-Yeah.

47:40.649 --> 47:42.192
That's your baby, Mr. Belker.
