01:40.009 --> 01:41.042
Hey!

03:10.804 --> 03:11.805
I'm Amber.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.939
Amber, Amber.

03:14.941 --> 03:16.242
Hi, I'm Amber.

03:16.244 --> 03:18.277
Hi, I'm Amber.

03:18.279 --> 03:19.378
Ted Hooper.

03:19.380 --> 03:20.882
Won't you come in?

03:23.385 --> 03:24.616
He mostly likes to
keep to himself.

03:29.023 --> 03:30.489
I'm busy.

03:30.491 --> 03:32.091
Coming in, okay?

03:33.061 --> 03:33.893
Kevin?

03:36.365 --> 03:37.197
Hey buddy.

03:37.199 --> 03:38.365
This is Amber.

03:38.367 --> 03:39.433
She's gonna be watching
you tonight, okay?

03:39.435 --> 03:40.434
Hey.

03:41.703 --> 03:42.736
So you're leaving
me with a stranger?

03:42.738 --> 03:43.870
Don't be silly, Kevin.

03:43.872 --> 03:45.406
It's just for tonight.

03:45.408 --> 03:46.706
What if I fall asleep and...

03:46.708 --> 03:49.342
Kevin, I'll be home as
soon as my date's over.

03:49.344 --> 03:50.710
Now come on down, okay?

03:50.712 --> 03:52.245
Ronnie will be here soon.

03:52.247 --> 03:53.780
So Charlotte's gonna
be my new mom now?

03:55.318 --> 03:56.250
Lighten up, kid.

03:56.252 --> 03:57.984
We're gonna be best buds, okay?

03:57.986 --> 03:58.819
I promise.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.390
I'll pinky promise.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.996
That's stupid.

04:08.265 --> 04:09.531
Yeah.

04:09.533 --> 04:10.365
I guess it is

04:12.435 --> 04:15.004
We'll let you get back to it.

04:18.442 --> 04:20.675
So, let's get the sob
story out of the way.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.312
My wife died about a year ago.

04:23.314 --> 04:24.146
My God.

04:24.148 --> 04:24.980
I'm so sorry.

04:24.982 --> 04:25.814
Don't be.

04:25.816 --> 04:27.649
You didn't kill her.

04:27.651 --> 04:29.452
Unless you did?

04:29.454 --> 04:30.388
I'm joking.

04:31.856 --> 04:36.360
The point is Kevin's been
a little moody since then.

04:36.961 --> 04:38.127
I can imagine.

04:38.129 --> 04:40.196
He's a
very sensitive boy.

04:40.198 --> 04:44.870
Bad thoughts, nightmares,
monsters hiding in his closet.

04:46.037 --> 04:48.138
Just make sure nothing
gets him too worked up.

04:48.140 --> 04:49.040
Mmm-hmmm.

04:52.445 --> 04:54.779
Well this is embarrassing.

04:56.282 --> 05:00.049
Who knows what evil
lurks in your small town,

05:00.051 --> 05:03.287
in your neighborhood
or even your own home.

05:03.289 --> 05:04.787
I forgot I left this on.

05:08.562 --> 05:09.860
What happens when a house of God

05:09.862 --> 05:12.199
becomes an unholy nightmare?

05:13.534 --> 05:17.435
A simple case of arson
or irrefutable proof

05:17.437 --> 05:19.504
of demonic possession?

05:19.506 --> 05:21.339
Join me on my
travels as I seek out

05:21.341 --> 05:23.276
rare artifacts of the occult.

05:23.278 --> 05:25.009
Take this suit of armor

05:25.011 --> 05:27.179
worn by the world's
first ghost hunter,

05:27.181 --> 05:29.349
Sir Barnabus Lord of Kent.

05:31.351 --> 05:32.918
Is that her?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.422
The Weeping Widow?

05:36.723 --> 05:40.726
Find out tonight on Ted Hooper:
Paranormal Investigator.

05:47.901 --> 05:49.368
It's called a sizzle reel.

05:49.370 --> 05:53.507
I'm waiting to hear back
from some investors.

05:53.509 --> 05:54.740
It's really something.

05:54.742 --> 05:55.841
Well, it's my life's work.

05:57.011 --> 05:59.313
The occult, the
macabre, the bizarre.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.150
I live for this stuff.

06:03.185 --> 06:06.019
So what's the scariest
thing you've ever seen?

06:06.021 --> 06:08.755
I've never seen
an event firsthand.

06:08.757 --> 06:10.493
Not once in 20 years.

06:12.061 --> 06:13.462
You believe that?

06:14.930 --> 06:16.333
One day, right?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.467
Would you like a drink?

06:19.469 --> 06:20.301
Whiskey?

06:20.303 --> 06:21.135
I'm having whiskey.

06:21.137 --> 06:22.906
Oh, I'm not 21 so...

06:23.907 --> 06:25.909
I was not 21 once too.

06:29.146 --> 06:30.546
I would actually love a drink.

06:33.517 --> 06:36.751
So, you
got any references?

06:36.753 --> 06:38.253
Oh um,

06:38.255 --> 06:42.291
well all of my numbers were
on my old phone which I lost.

06:42.293 --> 06:43.459
Don't you hate that?

06:43.461 --> 06:44.893
Oh, what a drag.

06:44.895 --> 06:46.128
Nobody in the
neighborhood, though?

06:46.130 --> 06:48.531
Nobody local who might know you?

06:48.533 --> 06:51.934
Um, well I'm still
sort of new in town,

06:51.936 --> 06:54.070
and I haven't
really had a chance

06:54.072 --> 06:56.643
to build up my client base yet.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.680
Pretty spooky, huh?

07:03.682 --> 07:04.813
It's my office.

07:04.815 --> 07:05.815
It's locked.

07:05.817 --> 07:07.250
Off limits.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.419
So that's where
the goodies are?

07:09.421 --> 07:11.622
Full of treasure, naturally.

07:11.624 --> 07:13.025
Like valuables?

07:13.925 --> 07:15.326
Like valuables.

07:15.328 --> 07:16.162
Sure.

07:17.397 --> 07:19.631
Well, the ambiance is um...

07:19.633 --> 07:20.800
It is, yeah.

07:23.437 --> 07:24.834
That's Finley.

07:24.836 --> 07:25.936
You'll love him.

07:29.108 --> 07:31.309
Sometimes Finley gets
a little rowdy outside,

07:31.311 --> 07:34.579
but the neighbors
never complain.

07:34.581 --> 07:37.151
You'll barely notice he's here.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.587
Pool, pool-house.

07:41.589 --> 07:44.856
A lot more fun in the
summer, but there you are.

07:44.858 --> 07:48.193
So, there's not much
cell service out here, huh?

07:48.195 --> 07:49.895
Well, it's a little
bit old school,

07:49.897 --> 07:51.863
but there's the landline.

07:51.865 --> 07:54.600
And there's a trick
with cell phones.

07:54.602 --> 07:55.535
Okay.

07:55.537 --> 07:56.803
Come on, I'll show you.

07:56.805 --> 07:59.607
Gotta get suited up
for the date anyway.

08:14.757 --> 08:16.457
You can usually get
reception in there.

08:16.459 --> 08:18.225
Feel free to check it out.

08:18.227 --> 08:19.061
Okay.

08:32.476 --> 08:34.244
Yeah, it works great.

08:36.212 --> 08:37.044
So, Amber.

08:37.046 --> 08:38.513
About tonight.

08:38.515 --> 08:41.515
If Charlotte asks, you sat
for Mr. Gilford up the street.

08:41.518 --> 08:42.784
Danny and Sarah are his kids.

08:42.785 --> 08:44.319
Very well-behaved.

08:44.321 --> 08:45.520
Okay.

08:46.390 --> 08:47.222
Oh.

08:47.224 --> 08:48.156
That's them.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.291
Finish your drink in here, okay?

08:49.293 --> 08:50.127
Oh.

08:51.696 --> 08:52.495
Hey.

08:52.497 --> 08:53.729
Hey!

08:53.731 --> 08:55.564
Great to see you.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.433
Ronnie, my man!

08:57.435 --> 08:58.269
Hi, Ted.

09:00.203 --> 09:01.170
Cool house.

09:01.172 --> 09:02.937
It's pretty big.

09:02.939 --> 09:04.907
Not bigger than my
dad's house though.

09:04.909 --> 09:05.776
Ronnie.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.844
Don't be a brat.

09:07.846 --> 09:09.044
And who's this cutie?

09:09.046 --> 09:09.880
Amber.

09:09.882 --> 09:10.714
Pleased to meet you.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.716
Charlotte LaFontaine.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.918
I'm just gonna go
grab Kevin, okay?

09:23.329 --> 09:25.164
So you like sitting?

09:26.398 --> 09:28.398
You good with kids?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.767
Yes.

09:29.769 --> 09:33.805
I usually sit for Mr.
Gilford's kids down the street.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.706
Danny and Sarah.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.909
Very well-behaved.

09:36.911 --> 09:38.142
Well, don't you
worry about this one,

09:38.144 --> 09:40.211
'cause he's gonna be
on his best behavior.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.714
Now what have we been
learning, Ronnie?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.850
My actions have consequences.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.553
He likes to mix it up
a bit, but he's harmless.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.656
Just make sure you
keep an eye on him.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.089
Okay.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.262
I know you're upset
that I'm leaving,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.431
so I'll understand if you
wanna go to bed early.

10:05.407 --> 10:07.140
I'll be home by midnight.

10:07.142 --> 10:09.375
If anything goes
wrong, Amber will help.

10:27.630 --> 10:30.431
You're gonna be just fine.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.600
Look who I found!

10:32.602 --> 10:34.368
Hey, Kevin!

10:34.370 --> 10:35.503
Shall we?

10:35.505 --> 10:36.336
Yes, we shall!

10:37.340 --> 10:39.440
X marks the spot, Ronnie.

10:39.442 --> 10:41.375
X marks the spot.

10:41.377 --> 10:43.210
He doesn't like
to say I love you.

10:43.212 --> 10:44.514
Hmm, who does?

10:46.683 --> 10:48.249
Ronnie.

10:48.251 --> 10:49.083
X marks the spot.

10:49.085 --> 10:49.887
Okay?

10:53.690 --> 10:55.123
I left money for pizza in there.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.392
And remember what I
said about my office.

10:57.394 --> 10:59.062
Strictly off-limits.

11:01.063 --> 11:02.165
No problem.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.602
You guys have fun, okay?

11:12.477 --> 11:14.914
I thought they'd never leave.

11:19.018 --> 11:21.618
Okay, I need to
make a phone call

11:21.620 --> 11:23.888
so you two just go hang out

11:25.056 --> 11:28.159
and watch some TV
or something, okay?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.301
Hey.

11:36.201 --> 11:37.467
You alone?

11:37.469 --> 11:38.970
Yeah, parents are gone.

11:38.972 --> 11:40.370
Just waiting on the kids.

11:40.372 --> 11:41.204
Well you better hurry.

11:41.206 --> 11:42.807
I don't have all night.

11:42.809 --> 11:44.976
Hey, bring your kit.

11:44.978 --> 11:48.347
I've got a job for
you when you get here.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.317
It's locked.

11:53.319 --> 11:55.520
You need the key.

11:55.522 --> 11:57.288
Think the babysitter's got it?

11:57.290 --> 11:59.557
I could seduce her.

11:59.559 --> 12:01.492
Ladies love me.

12:01.494 --> 12:03.394
Those are my dad's artifacts.

12:03.396 --> 12:05.967
He'd never trust them with her.

12:07.234 --> 12:09.170
He loves them too much.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.605
We're gonna get inside.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.438
I mean, what's the
worst that could...

12:14.642 --> 12:17.042
Pretty creepy, right?

12:17.044 --> 12:18.310
Little jumpy, Ronald?

12:18.312 --> 12:19.712
Whatever.

12:19.714 --> 12:21.380
You just surprised me.

12:21.382 --> 12:22.949
Aren't you gonna get us pizza?

12:22.951 --> 12:25.384
You have to buy us pizza.

12:25.386 --> 12:26.519
Ahhh!

12:26.521 --> 12:27.522
What a baby.

12:29.658 --> 12:30.590
Come on.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.862
Cheese.

12:35.864 --> 12:37.464
You can't just get cheese.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.032
You have to get pepperoni.

12:39.034 --> 12:40.500
He can pick it off.

12:40.502 --> 12:42.036
It'll have pepperoni grease.

12:42.038 --> 12:44.437
Yeah, it will have
pepperoni grease, Ronald.

12:44.439 --> 12:46.509
Stop calling me Ronald.

12:47.443 --> 12:49.175
Okay, we'll get half and half.

12:49.177 --> 12:50.745
But that's such a waste of m...

12:50.747 --> 12:52.647
And half cheese.

12:52.649 --> 12:53.483
Yep.

12:54.350 --> 12:55.316
Thanks.

13:04.293 --> 13:05.626
It smells funny.

13:05.628 --> 13:07.328
Like my uncle.

13:07.330 --> 13:08.563
Ronnie!

13:08.565 --> 13:10.132
I like the way you smell.

13:10.134 --> 13:11.433
Like home.

13:11.435 --> 13:12.936
What's this for?

13:13.804 --> 13:14.803
Ronnie!

13:14.805 --> 13:16.072
Ronnie, give that back.

13:16.074 --> 13:17.707
Give it back.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.174
It's complicated, okay?

13:19.176 --> 13:20.643
Can't be that complicated.

13:20.645 --> 13:23.812
You are a credit
to your gender, kid.

13:23.814 --> 13:25.915
Okay, pizza's not gonna
be here for a while,

13:25.917 --> 13:28.084
so let's watch some TV.

13:28.086 --> 13:29.317
Yeah?

13:29.319 --> 13:30.520
Dad turned off the
cable cause no one

13:30.522 --> 13:31.888
bought his ghost show

13:31.890 --> 13:34.590
even though it was
professional quality.

13:35.794 --> 13:36.826
Okay, okay.

13:36.828 --> 13:37.662
Umm.

13:39.330 --> 13:40.531
How about hide & seek?

13:40.533 --> 13:41.364
Yeah!

13:41.366 --> 13:43.000
I don't wanna play.

13:43.002 --> 13:44.001
Come on.

13:44.003 --> 13:45.402
Don't be a loser.

13:45.404 --> 13:46.904
Mmm, don't.

13:46.906 --> 13:49.973
Kevin, you are more than
welcome to sit down here

13:49.975 --> 13:52.478
and talk with Ronnie all night.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.279
Yeah, okay I'll play.

13:55.281 --> 13:56.547
Okay, awesome.

13:56.549 --> 13:58.215
It's a big house so
I will count to 100.

13:58.217 --> 13:59.986
Do your worst fellas.

14:00.854 --> 14:02.189
One, two, three,

14:05.625 --> 14:06.560
four, five.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.197
I already
told you it's locked.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.366
Where's your dad's room?

14:15.202 --> 14:16.036
Ummm.

14:17.738 --> 14:18.572
30, 31,

14:20.540 --> 14:21.374
32,

14:23.077 --> 14:23.911
33, 34,

14:26.781 --> 14:27.615
35, 36,

14:28.483 --> 14:29.317
37, 38

14:31.552 --> 14:32.386
39,

14:36.524 --> 14:37.358
100.

14:39.228 --> 14:40.294
Ready or not.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.766
We're supposed to be hiding.

14:45.768 --> 14:46.633
And seeking.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.469
Shut up.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.479
Oh shit.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.549
She's coming.

15:03.418 --> 15:04.254
Get out.

15:06.923 --> 15:09.025
It's locked, you dumbass.

15:44.930 --> 15:46.163
Hey.

15:46.165 --> 15:47.096
I've
been calling you.

15:47.098 --> 15:47.897
Yeah, I was gonna call you.

15:47.899 --> 15:48.865
Uh-huh.

15:48.867 --> 15:49.699
I'm out in the sticks.

15:49.701 --> 15:50.567
There's no service.

15:50.569 --> 15:51.734
Where?

15:51.736 --> 15:53.570
I thought maybe we
could hang out tonight.

15:53.572 --> 15:54.771
Okay, listen.

15:54.773 --> 15:57.607
The thing is I gotta
leave town soon,

15:57.609 --> 15:58.843
like tomorrow.

15:58.845 --> 16:00.343
When were
you gonna tell me?

16:00.345 --> 16:01.712
We've only been hooking
up for two months, okay?

16:01.714 --> 16:02.947
Grow up.

16:02.949 --> 16:03.981
Yeah the best
two months of my life.

16:04.951 --> 16:07.285
Let's talk about this, okay?

16:07.287 --> 16:08.719
I gotta go, okay?

16:08.721 --> 16:10.322
I love you.

16:10.324 --> 16:11.155
I love you.

16:11.157 --> 16:12.022
I like you.

16:12.024 --> 16:12.857
I love you.

16:12.859 --> 16:13.693
Bye.

16:17.897 --> 16:19.197
Guys, pizza's here.

16:19.199 --> 16:20.031
Game over.

16:20.033 --> 16:20.934
Hiders win.

16:22.435 --> 16:23.270
Oh.

16:24.370 --> 16:25.205
Hello.

16:26.173 --> 16:27.839
It's you.

16:27.841 --> 16:29.741
I was watching you earlier.

16:29.743 --> 16:30.575
Right.

16:30.577 --> 16:31.509
You waved.

16:31.511 --> 16:33.346
We waved at each other, yes.

16:33.348 --> 16:34.349
I'm Vincent.

16:35.282 --> 16:37.649
Amber, I'm just babysitting.

16:37.651 --> 16:39.918
Well, I just
wanted to stop by.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.522
Couldn't help but notice earlier
that you have a kind aura.

16:44.524 --> 16:45.423
Thanks.

16:45.425 --> 16:46.995
That's really nice.

16:48.029 --> 16:49.263
Have a Merry Christmas, okay?

16:49.265 --> 16:50.097
Christmas.

16:50.932 --> 16:52.465
Right.

16:52.467 --> 16:54.600
Did you know that the pagans
actually pioneered the idea

16:54.602 --> 16:56.603
of a wintertime
celebration of rebirth

16:56.605 --> 17:01.341
long before the so called
savior was even allegedly born?

17:01.343 --> 17:03.911
I'm sorry, is this like
a weird religious thing?

17:03.913 --> 17:05.378
Yes.

17:05.381 --> 17:08.949
But most things are, you know,
if you go back far enough.

17:08.951 --> 17:10.618
Okay, well thanks.

17:11.787 --> 17:14.454
Oh, I also have
lots of board games

17:14.455 --> 17:17.358
if you need help
with the little ones.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.530
I think I'll be
okay, but thank you.

17:21.631 --> 17:23.763
I actually should get back, so...

17:23.766 --> 17:26.666
Well if you need
anything, anything,

17:26.669 --> 17:29.506
I'm right next
door in the garage.

17:30.774 --> 17:32.740
I'm free all night.

17:32.742 --> 17:33.574
Okay.

17:33.576 --> 17:36.011
I think I can handle it.

17:36.013 --> 17:36.847
Take care.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.882
Okay.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.384
Bye.

17:41.386 --> 17:43.953
It would be really nice if we
could exchange information...

17:48.259 --> 17:50.326
Can you take a hint?

17:51.729 --> 17:53.996
Can't believe I
couldn't find you guys.

17:53.998 --> 17:56.399
Guess you just
suck at hide & seek.

17:56.401 --> 17:58.034
Ronnie, did your
mom ever teach you

17:58.036 --> 18:00.003
that if you don't have
anything nice to say,

18:00.005 --> 18:02.274
don't say anything at all?

18:06.212 --> 18:07.046
Fuck.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.849
I like your drawings.

18:12.851 --> 18:13.685
Why?

18:14.820 --> 18:15.986
They're horrible.

18:15.988 --> 18:17.388
I hate them.

18:17.390 --> 18:18.356
So don't make them.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.857
My doctor says I should draw

18:19.859 --> 18:22.660
whenever I'm
emotionally vulnerable.

18:22.662 --> 18:23.761
Does that help?

18:23.763 --> 18:24.929
Drawing?

18:24.931 --> 18:26.365
Seeing a doctor.

18:26.367 --> 18:27.798
Not really.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.401
I mostly show them my drawings,

18:29.403 --> 18:32.437
and then they tell my dad I
have antisocial tendencies.

18:32.439 --> 18:34.873
X marks
the spot, Ronnie

18:34.875 --> 18:36.073
X marks the spot, okay?

18:49.023 --> 18:50.990
Oh, you little shit.

18:50.992 --> 18:52.260
You shit fucker.

18:58.401 --> 18:59.898
Fuck.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.734
Fuck.

19:04.172 --> 19:05.004
All right.

19:05.006 --> 19:05.838
Time for bed.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.873
Let's go.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.174
You got it.

19:08.176 --> 19:09.345
Come on, Kev-o

19:11.112 --> 19:12.179
What if I clean?

19:12.181 --> 19:13.916
Can I stay up longer?

19:15.683 --> 19:16.683
Kevin, you're not in trouble.

19:16.685 --> 19:18.619
You just need to go to bed.

19:18.621 --> 19:19.456
Come on.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.745
Go fetch, Finley.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.383
Kids in bed yet?

20:20.385 --> 20:21.318
Yeah, the
kids are asleep.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.552
Is this your phone?

20:22.554 --> 20:23.220
No, it's
the house line.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.121
Oh.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.255
Can you bring a truck?

20:25.257 --> 20:26.189
A truck?

20:26.191 --> 20:27.023
Why?

20:27.025 --> 20:28.092
It's a big house.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.327
Just in case.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.361
Yeah, I've
got a connect.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.395
What's the address?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.032
It's 187 Idledale.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.534
Amber?

20:37.803 --> 20:40.538
Hey, you okay, kiddo?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.140
Can I ask you something?

20:42.142 --> 20:42.942
Uh-huh.

20:44.344 --> 20:48.181
Why did you take my dad's
money and his watches?

20:50.117 --> 20:51.617
I, I didn't.

20:51.619 --> 20:52.918
In the bedroom.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.219
I was under the bed.

20:54.221 --> 20:55.055
Hiding.

20:56.023 --> 20:57.291
Hide & go seek.

21:00.026 --> 21:00.860
Okay.

21:07.368 --> 21:08.834
When I was your age,

21:08.836 --> 21:10.403
it drove me nuts when
people talked down to me.

21:10.405 --> 21:13.141
So I'm just gonna
level with you.

21:16.077 --> 21:19.649
I stole from your dad
because I need money.

21:20.715 --> 21:22.950
But he's rich and I'm poor.

21:25.287 --> 21:27.055
It's like Robin Hood.

21:28.524 --> 21:30.156
You know Robin Hood?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.925
Well he's a good guy, right?

21:31.927 --> 21:35.963
He breaks the rules, but he
does it for the right reason.

21:35.965 --> 21:37.433
You get it, right?

21:39.068 --> 21:40.602
Of course you get it.

21:40.604 --> 21:43.407
But your dad, he
might not get it,

21:44.774 --> 21:47.374
and he might go all Sheriff
of Nottingham on us.

21:47.376 --> 21:50.346
So, it's got to be
our secret, okay?

21:52.181 --> 21:54.114
Can I tell you a secret?

21:54.116 --> 21:56.850
That's the only
way we'll be even.

21:56.852 --> 21:59.354
There's something
trying to get me.

21:59.356 --> 22:01.358
Three of them, actually.

22:02.793 --> 22:07.665
They find me in my dreams when
I'm laying in bed at night.

22:08.399 --> 22:10.266
And I hear them humming

22:10.268 --> 22:14.035
like they're right
inside my closet.

22:14.037 --> 22:16.037
Waiting for me.

22:16.039 --> 22:16.940
To hurt me.

22:17.841 --> 22:19.944
What do they look like?

22:25.283 --> 22:29.054
I never see them up
close, but I hear them,

22:30.189 --> 22:31.023
laughing,

22:32.091 --> 22:33.357
whispering.

22:33.359 --> 22:36.792
And I keep moving
towards them, but

22:36.794 --> 22:38.130
I don't want to.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.704
Okay, well we can compromise,

22:45.938 --> 22:48.138
like two grownups.

22:48.140 --> 22:49.806
I will go upstairs with you,

22:49.808 --> 22:51.876
and I'll stay until
you fall asleep

22:51.878 --> 22:53.444
to make sure that you're safe.

22:53.446 --> 22:54.281
Okay?

23:00.786 --> 23:02.289
Hold on.

23:25.746 --> 23:26.580
Okay.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.316
Once upon a time there was a

23:33.689 --> 23:34.521
sorry.

23:34.523 --> 23:35.357
Excuse me.

23:36.759 --> 23:41.027
Once upon a time there
was a boy in a lighthouse.

23:41.029 --> 23:44.432
Every day he stared out at
the sea, watching ships go by.

23:46.336 --> 23:48.301
Each one off to a new adventure

23:48.303 --> 23:51.772
and a new exotic
part of the world.

23:53.409 --> 23:55.643
At night the boy dreamt of
the furthest the reaches

23:55.645 --> 23:59.146
of the globe, but in the
morning the boy awoke

23:59.148 --> 24:00.651
in the lighthouse.

24:03.086 --> 24:05.520
One stormy day a ship rolled by.

24:05.522 --> 24:07.556
He couldn't take it anymore.

24:07.558 --> 24:08.890
He had to know what the world

24:08.892 --> 24:11.562
outside the lighthouse was like.

24:13.497 --> 24:17.199
He jumped into the water and
he swam as hard as he could,

24:17.201 --> 24:21.870
but the tide was high and
the waves were strong.

24:21.872 --> 24:23.606
He soon grew tired.

24:23.608 --> 24:25.708
He could see the
ship passing by,

24:25.710 --> 24:28.511
but he couldn't swim
fast enough to reach it.

24:28.513 --> 24:30.213
And soon it was gone.

24:30.215 --> 24:32.484
Vanishing over the horizon.

24:35.285 --> 24:36.885
He turned back to his home,

24:36.887 --> 24:39.991
but he was too tired
to swim anymore.

24:42.026 --> 24:43.727
His arms and his legs burned

24:43.729 --> 24:47.698
and he felt himself
sinking below the waves.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.633
He sank farther
and farther still

24:49.635 --> 24:53.406
until his feet touched
the floor of the ocean.

24:54.775 --> 24:57.375
It was there that he
remembered how cozy it was

24:57.377 --> 24:58.878
in the lighthouse.

25:00.579 --> 25:04.849
He suddenly felt foolish, and
he opened his mouth to laugh.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.183
But just as it opened...

25:49.197 --> 25:50.031
Hello?

27:05.578 --> 27:06.411
Wait.

27:10.650 --> 27:11.782
It worked.

27:11.784 --> 27:13.350
No nightmares.

27:13.352 --> 27:15.386
You have to stay.

27:15.388 --> 27:17.221
You're fine, okay?

27:17.223 --> 27:18.423
Go back to sleep.

27:18.425 --> 27:20.492
I won't tell my
dad about Robin Hood.

27:24.196 --> 27:25.195
Okay.

27:25.197 --> 27:27.264
I'm gonna leave you here alone

27:27.266 --> 27:29.801
because that's what you need.

27:29.803 --> 27:32.539
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

27:34.641 --> 27:37.912
You lost your mother,
but you survived.

27:39.279 --> 27:41.349
You gotta be strong, kid.

27:45.921 --> 27:48.054
You gotta be brave.

27:48.056 --> 27:48.890
Okay?

27:50.223 --> 27:51.289
Okay.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.727
Okay, go to bed.

27:58.834 --> 27:59.633
Sorry, I'm sorry.

27:59.635 --> 28:00.433
Ow, what the hell?

28:00.435 --> 28:01.602
Sorry, Ronnie.

28:01.604 --> 28:02.836
Oh my God you
kicked me in the arm!

28:02.838 --> 28:04.170
It was an honest
mistake, Ronnie.

28:04.172 --> 28:05.038
It hurts!

28:05.040 --> 28:05.872
I need a doctor!

28:05.874 --> 28:07.207
I need a doctor, Kevin!

28:07.209 --> 28:08.408
Kevin, you saw!

28:08.410 --> 28:10.110
She kicked me right in the arm!

28:10.112 --> 28:11.044
Okay.

28:11.046 --> 28:13.013
Kevin, close your eyes, okay?

28:13.015 --> 28:15.983
You're gonna be
in so much trouble.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.150
She's gonna...

28:23.059 --> 28:23.958
How's that arm?

28:23.960 --> 28:25.059
Arm.

28:25.061 --> 28:26.027
Good.

28:26.029 --> 28:26.863
It's good.

28:28.732 --> 28:30.365
Good.

28:30.367 --> 28:31.802
Sleep well, boys.

28:34.370 --> 28:36.104
What happened?

28:36.106 --> 28:38.806
She got totally naked.

28:38.808 --> 28:39.609
Nuh-uh.

28:42.479 --> 28:44.245
Wanna have some fun?

28:44.247 --> 28:45.850
What do you mean?

28:49.654 --> 28:51.455
Lookie what I found.

29:19.419 --> 29:20.651
Jesus, Martin?

29:20.653 --> 29:21.986
What the fuck are
you doing here?

29:21.988 --> 29:23.120
That's nice.

29:23.122 --> 29:24.654
Very civil.

29:24.656 --> 29:25.890
Who's house is this?

29:25.892 --> 29:27.892
How did you even
know I was here?

29:27.894 --> 29:28.893
I called Rod.

29:28.895 --> 29:30.260
And lower your voice, please.

29:30.262 --> 29:32.530
Rod did not tell
you where I was.

29:32.532 --> 29:35.033
Well, the girl
he's doing told me,

29:35.035 --> 29:36.634
and she also told
me something else.

29:36.636 --> 29:37.736
Lindsey.

29:37.738 --> 29:39.171
God, that bitch.

29:39.173 --> 29:42.941
She told me what
you're doing here.

29:44.511 --> 29:45.345
Yeah.

29:46.412 --> 29:48.446
Goddammit, come on.

29:48.448 --> 29:50.115
Go.

29:56.024 --> 29:58.725
I'm an accomplice just by
being here, you know that?

29:58.727 --> 30:00.560
Oh my God.

30:00.562 --> 30:01.761
That's what I'm risking

30:01.763 --> 30:05.665
to tell you that you're
my girlfriend, and...

30:05.667 --> 30:06.866
No, no, I'm not.

30:06.868 --> 30:08.769
And I'm committed
to helping you

30:08.771 --> 30:11.838
get out of this dark place.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.905
Okay, the guy is rich.

30:12.907 --> 30:14.073
He's insured.

30:14.075 --> 30:15.541
And it's not like
we're cleaning him out.

30:15.543 --> 30:16.843
We'll just get all the
electronics in the truck.

30:24.587 --> 30:25.421
Wait.

30:26.455 --> 30:27.389
I'll do it.

30:55.153 --> 30:55.987
Whoa.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.325
This is so cool.

31:10.802 --> 31:11.869
Look at that.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.244
These still have blood on them.

31:50.210 --> 31:51.811
The Three Mothers.

32:15.803 --> 32:16.637
Ow!

32:19.007 --> 32:22.075
Aw, did baby hurt himself?

32:22.077 --> 32:23.578
Shut up, Ronnie.

33:15.733 --> 33:17.166
Ronnie?

33:56.709 --> 33:59.110
Stop honking,
you fucking idiot!

33:59.112 --> 34:00.044
Woo!

34:00.046 --> 34:01.045
What up, girl?

34:01.047 --> 34:02.314
Let's burgle.

34:02.316 --> 34:03.581
Why not just set
off some fireworks

34:03.583 --> 34:05.184
or fuck it let's just
call the police, Rod.

34:05.186 --> 34:06.418
Look, hold up.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.419
I've been calling you.

34:07.421 --> 34:08.686
I've been texting you.

34:08.688 --> 34:09.922
What the fuck are
you worried about?

34:09.924 --> 34:12.156
It's a goddamn ghost
town out here anyway.

34:12.158 --> 34:12.991
Oh shit.

34:12.993 --> 34:14.326
Look out.

34:14.328 --> 34:15.860
You got your angry
face on again.

34:15.862 --> 34:17.396
Look how tough you are.

34:17.398 --> 34:18.563
Come on.

34:18.565 --> 34:19.797
We about to get this money.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.632
There's my girl.

34:20.634 --> 34:21.567
You know I've got you.

34:21.569 --> 34:23.268
I've got the truck, right?

34:23.270 --> 34:24.103
Oh God.

34:24.105 --> 34:24.969
Oh my God!

34:24.972 --> 34:26.239
This is so exciting!

34:26.241 --> 34:27.072
Volume.

34:27.074 --> 34:28.674
What did I just say?

34:28.676 --> 34:29.510
Lindsey.

34:30.445 --> 34:32.212
You're here.

34:32.214 --> 34:33.780
Yeah, I mean I
couldn't resist.

34:33.782 --> 34:35.981
It sounded so fun,
robbing someone!

34:35.983 --> 34:37.983
Let's do this shit.

34:37.985 --> 34:40.887
What the
hell are you wearing?

34:40.889 --> 34:42.856
I'm a cat burglar.

34:42.858 --> 34:45.925
It's called a sense of occasion.

34:45.927 --> 34:47.827
Cat burglars wear
all black, Lindsey.

34:47.829 --> 34:49.330
Ugh, boring.

34:49.331 --> 34:50.831
Yeah and it took her ass
two hours to get ready too.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.433
Look at her.

34:52.435 --> 34:53.768
Okay, can we
please get serious?

34:53.770 --> 34:55.002
Yes.

34:55.004 --> 34:57.204
Your passion is
seriously inspiring.

34:57.206 --> 34:59.039
Her passion?

34:59.041 --> 35:00.107
For stealing things?

35:00.109 --> 35:01.608
Oh my God.

35:01.610 --> 35:02.877
Why in the hell did you
bring the ball and chain?

35:02.879 --> 35:03.878
I don't know.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.379
Ask Lindsey.

35:05.381 --> 35:07.181
Well, he said that
it was an emergency

35:07.183 --> 35:08.582
and that he was your boyfriend.

35:08.584 --> 35:09.884
- He's not.
- I am, I am!

35:09.886 --> 35:10.988
You're not.

35:13.223 --> 35:14.058
Awkward.

35:15.225 --> 35:17.325
Rod, can you please
just take the truck

35:17.327 --> 35:19.561
around the side of the
house discreetly, please.

35:19.563 --> 35:22.130
Hey look, discretion is
my motherfucking jam, baby.

35:22.132 --> 35:23.298
Let's go, cute booty.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.132
Let's go.

35:24.134 --> 35:25.067
Oops!

35:25.069 --> 35:26.601
I'm gonna get you back for that.

35:26.603 --> 35:28.937
I don't even know
why you hang out with them.

35:28.939 --> 35:29.773
Martin.

35:31.509 --> 35:33.577
You're a nice guy, right?

35:35.679 --> 35:37.013
Please just fuck
off before I have

35:37.015 --> 35:39.048
to start getting mean, okay?

35:42.321 --> 35:45.988
You know pretty soon
you're gonna realize

35:45.990 --> 35:48.057
that you messed up.

35:48.059 --> 35:49.460
Don't.

35:49.462 --> 35:53.197
And when you do,
I'm gonna be there.

35:53.199 --> 35:55.631
Because that's what
good boyfriends do.

36:01.607 --> 36:03.541
Get inside, get inside.

36:12.785 --> 36:13.619
Ronnie?

36:28.035 --> 36:28.870
Ronnie?

36:29.871 --> 36:32.039
Ronnie, this isn't a joke.

36:50.993 --> 36:52.094
I can do this.

37:01.236 --> 37:02.569
Ronnie.

37:02.571 --> 37:03.405
Seriously.

37:05.642 --> 37:08.244
I don't want to get in trouble.

37:28.998 --> 37:29.832
Ronnie?

37:30.733 --> 37:33.268
Hide & seek, Kevin.

37:33.270 --> 37:34.369
Let's play.

38:01.199 --> 38:02.033
Ronnie?

38:05.204 --> 38:06.537
Oh, holy shit!

38:06.539 --> 38:07.771
Look at the size of
this place, baby.

38:07.773 --> 38:09.006
Come on over here.

38:09.008 --> 38:10.273
Would you
shut the fuck up?

38:10.275 --> 38:12.678
I just got the kids to sleep.

38:13.679 --> 38:15.912
Ronnie?

38:22.054 --> 38:22.886
All right.

38:22.888 --> 38:25.190
So what are we doing?

38:25.192 --> 38:27.225
Why don't we take the TV down?

38:27.227 --> 38:28.226
Start with that.

38:28.228 --> 38:29.995
That little piece of shit?

38:29.997 --> 38:30.895
That TV?

38:30.897 --> 38:31.830
Are you serious?

38:31.832 --> 38:34.098
Yes, can you just do it?

38:34.100 --> 38:35.567
Please.

38:35.569 --> 38:36.434
All right, playboy.

38:36.436 --> 38:37.269
Let's do this.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.103
Come on.

38:38.105 --> 38:38.937
I'm here for her.

38:38.939 --> 38:39.772
Not this.

38:41.475 --> 38:44.175
You better
control your man.

38:47.448 --> 38:48.948
I know that
you're upset, baby.

38:48.950 --> 38:50.149
I know.

38:50.151 --> 38:51.917
And I'm sorry and I
know that it's my fault,

38:51.919 --> 38:53.121
but if you just

38:54.422 --> 38:56.956
help out a little bit

38:56.958 --> 38:58.291
then we can all leave.

38:58.293 --> 39:00.393
And that's what you want, right?

39:00.395 --> 39:01.260
Right?

39:01.262 --> 39:02.997
That's what you want?

39:05.266 --> 39:06.533
Go.

39:06.535 --> 39:08.000
Please.

39:09.238 --> 39:10.170
Let's just
get this over with.

39:10.172 --> 39:13.006
You're a fucking siren, babe.

39:13.008 --> 39:16.446
I mean he must go down
on you a lot, huh?

39:20.916 --> 39:21.750
Huh.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.351
Unbelievable, Rod.

39:24.353 --> 39:25.252
Really?

39:25.254 --> 39:26.453
What?

39:26.455 --> 39:27.689
Look, it ain't about
how heavy it is.

39:27.691 --> 39:29.490
Shit's mounted to the
wall or something.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.292
No, you are blown
halfway out of your shit.

39:32.662 --> 39:33.895
Both of you!

39:33.897 --> 39:35.330
No, no, no.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.130
We're just trying to
stay focused, right babe?

39:36.132 --> 39:37.165
Most definitely.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.232
Look, my shit is laser-guided...

39:41.505 --> 39:42.771
Put it down, man.

39:42.773 --> 39:44.506
Great.

39:44.508 --> 39:45.474
What?

39:45.476 --> 39:46.407
Okay.

39:46.409 --> 39:48.309
You brought your kit, right?

39:48.311 --> 39:49.844
It's old.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.680
It's real old.

39:51.682 --> 39:53.848
Might take some digging,
but you know me.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.117
I'm gonna get up in there.

39:55.119 --> 39:57.186
It doesn't matter
how long it takes.

39:57.188 --> 39:59.823
He keeps it locked for a reason.

39:59.825 --> 40:01.190
No doubt.

40:03.562 --> 40:04.661
What was that?

40:04.663 --> 40:05.595
Oh God.

40:05.597 --> 40:06.396
I'll be right back you guys.

40:06.398 --> 40:07.564
All right.

40:09.167 --> 40:11.501
Well, it's time to
watch daddy work.

40:28.755 --> 40:31.422
Looks like we're
ahead of schedule.

40:31.424 --> 40:32.724
What?

40:32.726 --> 40:34.492
Shit, you know what.

40:34.494 --> 40:35.294
Come on.

40:37.663 --> 40:38.696
Woo!

40:44.371 --> 40:45.171
Finley?

40:46.072 --> 40:46.874
Here boy.

40:49.543 --> 40:50.845
Come on, Finley.

40:53.715 --> 40:54.547
Don't, don't.

40:54.549 --> 40:56.150
Please just don't.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.983
Let's play.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.267
Come on.

42:24.743 --> 42:25.744
Yeah, Rod!

42:27.513 --> 42:28.680
"Yeah, Rod!"

42:32.384 --> 42:34.016
Hey.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.418
Do you think she likes me?

42:35.420 --> 42:37.487
She don't like people.

42:37.489 --> 42:39.623
I know, I just, I get
these weird vibes from her.

42:39.625 --> 42:42.158
Like I feel like I'm
out here being friendly

42:42.160 --> 42:45.028
and she has to be all alpha.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.531
Sure.

42:46.533 --> 42:47.500
Ow, Jesus!

42:49.435 --> 42:51.636
I don't know, I just, I
wish she would realize

42:51.638 --> 42:53.705
that I'm not a threat.

42:53.707 --> 42:55.774
Hey, you wanna do a line?

42:55.776 --> 42:57.342
We already finished it.

42:57.344 --> 42:58.276
Damn, for real?

42:58.278 --> 42:59.210
Yeah.

42:59.212 --> 43:00.611
I gave you a whole vial.

43:00.613 --> 43:02.413
It was
a long ride over.

43:02.415 --> 43:03.447
Mm-hmm.

43:03.449 --> 43:04.315
I know yo ass.

43:05.553 --> 43:08.119
All
right, one second.

43:08.121 --> 43:11.191
Hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

43:16.598 --> 43:18.533
Come on girl, hurry up!

43:25.139 --> 43:28.710
Hey, now you know I
can hear that in there.

44:31.242 --> 44:33.411
Whoa, baby, you all right?

44:35.213 --> 44:36.113
I like you.

44:36.115 --> 44:37.546
Well I like you, too.

44:37.548 --> 44:39.651
But I also like to share.

44:42.286 --> 44:43.122
Oh!

44:46.125 --> 44:46.959
Mmmm.

44:47.994 --> 44:49.428
Ow, ow, ow, damn!

44:50.362 --> 44:51.194
What?

44:51.196 --> 44:52.462
Shit!

44:52.464 --> 44:53.131
Don't
you want to play?

44:53.133 --> 44:54.432
You bit me!

44:54.434 --> 44:56.770
We could have so much fun.

45:08.114 --> 45:09.313
I'm gonna hurt you.

45:09.315 --> 45:10.748
Huh?

45:10.750 --> 45:12.650
Goddamn it.

45:12.652 --> 45:13.919
"Like valuables"?

45:13.921 --> 45:15.487
You know I hate it
when you ignore me.

45:15.489 --> 45:19.091
Good relationships are
built on communication.

45:19.093 --> 45:22.127
Oh, you're just not
gonna talk to me now?

45:22.129 --> 45:23.062
All right.

45:23.064 --> 45:25.132
Two can play at that game.

45:28.201 --> 45:29.036
Ronnie?

46:29.533 --> 46:30.967
I am not stealing for you.

46:30.969 --> 46:32.267
Well then go the
fuck home, Martin.

46:32.269 --> 46:34.469
Nobody asked you to be here,

46:35.739 --> 46:37.006
Kevin!

46:37.008 --> 46:38.841
Turn on your light,
turn on your light!

46:38.843 --> 46:39.676
Go, go!

46:41.112 --> 46:41.946
Kevin!

46:43.280 --> 46:44.349
What's wrong?

46:45.251 --> 46:47.450
They killed Ronnie.

46:47.452 --> 46:49.454
Ronnie's not upstairs?

46:50.355 --> 46:51.657
Ronnie's dead.

46:53.726 --> 46:56.393
Can you look around and
see if you can find him?

46:56.395 --> 46:58.494
I don't know
what he looks like.

46:58.496 --> 46:59.495
There are two kids.

46:59.497 --> 47:00.964
One of them is right here.

47:00.966 --> 47:01.999
It's not exactly a needle
in a fucking haystack!

47:02.001 --> 47:03.700
Just do it.

47:03.702 --> 47:04.537
Please.

47:07.339 --> 47:09.107
Kevin, tell me what happened.

47:09.109 --> 47:14.114
I tried to be brave like
you said, but they're here.

47:14.714 --> 47:15.515
They're real.

47:17.117 --> 47:19.017
Not in my closet,

47:19.019 --> 47:20.485
but in my dad's office.

47:20.487 --> 47:21.320
Who is?

47:22.923 --> 47:24.423
They're witches.

47:25.559 --> 47:26.726
Three of them.

47:30.797 --> 47:32.900
I got nothing.

47:34.367 --> 47:35.634
Ronnie's dead.

47:35.636 --> 47:36.635
He's not.

47:36.637 --> 47:38.137
He's just hiding somewhere.

47:38.139 --> 47:40.240
I heard screaming.

47:40.242 --> 47:41.308
Someone else screaming.

47:41.310 --> 47:42.541
It's nothing, it's nothing.

47:42.543 --> 47:43.776
It'll be fine, okay?

47:43.778 --> 47:46.745
Can you go up and
find Ronnie please?

47:46.747 --> 47:47.780
Ronnie's dead.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.550
Who are these people?

47:50.618 --> 47:51.851
Who is this kid?

47:51.853 --> 47:55.554
They are um, they're
just, they're just...

47:55.556 --> 47:58.390
Can we please
just fucking leave?

47:58.392 --> 47:59.893
Am I losing my mind here?

47:59.895 --> 48:02.529
This was fucked before a
little kid went missing.

48:02.531 --> 48:04.364
We can't even see
anything in here.

48:04.366 --> 48:06.466
There's lanterns
in the pool house.

48:06.468 --> 48:09.703
Seriously, who are these people?

48:09.705 --> 48:10.973
They're just,

48:13.408 --> 48:15.910
they're helping
me rob your house.

48:15.912 --> 48:16.911
What the fuck?

48:16.913 --> 48:18.411
Bush league!

48:18.413 --> 48:19.347
You don't never tell nobody
that your robbing they're ass!

48:19.349 --> 48:21.849
He already knew!

48:21.851 --> 48:23.086
Hello, child.

48:25.455 --> 48:26.687
Aww.

48:26.689 --> 48:29.324
You're afraid, aren't you?

48:30.861 --> 48:32.294
Amber?

48:32.296 --> 48:33.563
Amber?

48:34.764 --> 48:37.531
It's
Vincent from earlier.

48:37.533 --> 48:38.967
We bail, right?

48:38.969 --> 48:40.369
Yeah, and then they'll
come after me for kidnapping.

48:40.371 --> 48:42.104
No, we need to find that
little shit, Ronnie.

48:42.106 --> 48:44.439
I don't think
your doorbell's working.

48:44.441 --> 48:45.275
You guys need help?

48:45.277 --> 48:46.109
Okay, okay.

48:46.111 --> 48:46.944
Lanterns.

48:48.980 --> 48:49.814
Just go.

48:51.249 --> 48:52.414
Check out the office.

48:52.416 --> 48:53.316
There's gotta be
something we can flip.

48:53.318 --> 48:54.317
Yeah, you got it.

48:54.319 --> 48:55.518
I'll watch Kevin.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.120
Looks
like your power's out.

48:57.122 --> 48:58.356
Amber, Amber?

49:00.292 --> 49:01.523
Don't worry child.

49:01.525 --> 49:04.062
I know
you're in there.

49:05.398 --> 49:06.229
Hey.

49:06.231 --> 49:07.400
Hello again.

49:08.367 --> 49:09.899
Everything okay in here?

49:09.901 --> 49:10.733
Uhh.

49:10.735 --> 49:12.002
Yeah, no.

49:12.004 --> 49:15.839
It's nothing, we just
turned the lights off.

49:15.841 --> 49:17.908
I also heard screaming.

49:17.910 --> 49:19.944
Yeah, it's just the kids.

49:19.946 --> 49:22.146
They're really rambunctious,

49:22.148 --> 49:24.181
love to scream,

49:24.183 --> 49:26.850
nothing like the Gilfords.

49:26.852 --> 49:29.086
It really looks
like your power's out.

49:29.088 --> 49:31.222
I've got scented
candles if you want...

49:31.224 --> 49:33.158
No, no, that's okay.

49:33.160 --> 49:36.897
Ummm, we turned the
lights off, power's fine.

49:41.402 --> 49:42.467
I can call an electrician.

49:42.469 --> 49:43.702
Hey, you know what?

49:43.704 --> 49:46.805
Why don't we check
out your place.

49:46.807 --> 49:48.239
I can come by for a minute.

49:48.241 --> 49:49.074
Yes!

49:49.076 --> 49:50.008
Yeah?

49:50.010 --> 49:51.876
I mean, yeah, if you want to.

49:51.878 --> 49:52.711
That's fine.

49:52.713 --> 49:53.545
Cool, okay?

49:53.547 --> 49:54.479
Yeah, yeah.

49:54.481 --> 49:57.717
Okay, let's do that.

49:57.719 --> 50:01.020
After you,
after you, my lady.

50:14.036 --> 50:16.205
What's your name, child?

50:17.439 --> 50:19.773
Kevin Edward Hooper.

50:19.775 --> 50:24.379
Do you miss your friend,
Kevin Edward Hooper?

50:24.381 --> 50:26.216
He wasn't my friend.

50:27.616 --> 50:30.451
Are you afraid that you're
gonna get hurt like him?

50:30.453 --> 50:32.756
Maybe we could find Amber?

50:33.856 --> 50:35.123
Please.

50:35.125 --> 50:38.026
Hey, I think I know
where she went, come on.

50:38.028 --> 50:39.526
I'll show you.

50:47.837 --> 50:51.539
I've been thinking
about having a door put in.

50:51.541 --> 50:52.841
Yeah.

51:03.087 --> 51:05.888
I know what's
going on over there by the way.

51:05.890 --> 51:07.190
What?

51:07.192 --> 51:09.691
You know that, right?

51:09.693 --> 51:11.161
Uh.

51:11.163 --> 51:12.896
You're having a little party.

51:12.898 --> 51:14.464
You and your friends
in the white truck.

51:14.466 --> 51:15.466
Oh.

51:15.468 --> 51:16.299
I won't tell.

51:16.301 --> 51:17.303
Don't worry.

51:18.904 --> 51:19.738
Beer?

51:21.273 --> 51:22.706
No, no, thanks.

51:23.842 --> 51:27.012
So you, you really
believe in this stuff?

51:28.780 --> 51:29.746
What?

51:29.748 --> 51:31.015
The dark arts?

51:31.017 --> 51:32.316
The occult?

51:32.318 --> 51:35.221
Sure,
this satanic stuff.

51:36.355 --> 51:37.988
Before Christianity
co-opted all

51:37.990 --> 51:40.057
of the most important
dates on the calendar,

51:40.059 --> 51:44.031
every culture celebrated
satanic or pagan ideas.

51:45.431 --> 51:47.198
You ever met Ted, next door?

51:47.200 --> 51:48.799
Just in passing.

51:48.801 --> 51:51.769
You guys would get along.

51:51.771 --> 51:54.239
I take it you don't believe
in that kind of stuff?

51:54.241 --> 51:56.374
I've never seen
any evidence so...

51:56.376 --> 51:58.645
I doubt you were looking.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.380
You smoke?

52:01.382 --> 52:05.485
Don't take this the wrong way,
but it seems like you smoke.

52:05.487 --> 52:06.321
Ummm.

52:17.165 --> 52:19.699
What do you know about witches?

52:27.109 --> 52:28.609
But that's...

52:28.611 --> 52:30.512
You should be with your
friend, Kevin Edward Hooper.

52:30.514 --> 52:31.613
He misses you.

52:31.615 --> 52:32.879
No, no!

52:32.881 --> 52:34.046
It's your turn, child.

52:34.048 --> 52:35.149
No, no!

52:35.151 --> 52:35.985
Amber!

52:37.186 --> 52:38.020
Hey!

52:41.957 --> 52:43.790
What the hell was that?

52:43.792 --> 52:46.026
You fucking idiot.

52:46.028 --> 52:50.098
You worthless piece
of shit-crusted filth!

52:50.100 --> 52:52.435
You better watch your tone.

52:53.803 --> 52:55.504
How's this?

52:55.506 --> 52:59.174
So, what
do you wanna know?

52:59.176 --> 53:00.608
I don't know.

53:00.610 --> 53:01.945
I mean, nothing.

53:02.879 --> 53:03.945
It's just this kid next door.

53:03.947 --> 53:04.779
He's...

53:05.949 --> 53:07.483
Well, I've written
more Wikipedia

53:07.485 --> 53:09.418
than most people have read
when it comes to witches.

53:09.420 --> 53:11.587
That's a really good
sativa by the way,

53:11.589 --> 53:13.989
and it's almost
the witching hour.

53:13.991 --> 53:14.823
The?

53:14.825 --> 53:15.659
Midnight.

53:15.661 --> 53:16.792
The witching hour.

53:18.564 --> 53:21.897
Amber,
Amber, Amber help!

53:21.899 --> 53:23.501
What, what, what?

53:25.069 --> 53:26.035
Your friend!

53:26.037 --> 53:26.938
She's evil.

53:28.773 --> 53:30.440
She's not my friend.

53:30.442 --> 53:31.807
And yeah, she's the worst.

53:31.809 --> 53:33.310
No, no!

53:33.312 --> 53:36.079
She tried to kill me and
she tried to lead me down

53:36.081 --> 53:39.015
to the basement and that's
where they killed Ronnie.

53:39.017 --> 53:42.553
Kevin, okay,
you're okay, right?

53:42.555 --> 53:43.988
I won't leave you again.

53:43.990 --> 53:45.924
You don't believe me.

53:47.025 --> 53:48.927
Have you met Vincent?

53:49.895 --> 53:52.230
He knows all about this stuff.

53:52.232 --> 53:55.233
You know you should
tell him what you saw,

53:55.235 --> 53:57.001
exactly what you saw,

53:57.003 --> 54:00.441
and then he'll tell
you whether it's real

54:02.243 --> 54:04.178
or definitely not real.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.647
There's witches in my house.

54:07.649 --> 54:08.879
Witches?

54:08.881 --> 54:09.715
And they
all wear masks.

54:09.717 --> 54:10.682
Masks?

54:10.684 --> 54:12.286
What kind of masks?

54:16.090 --> 54:17.522
Did you copy these
out of a book?

54:17.524 --> 54:18.523
No.

54:18.525 --> 54:19.458
Freehand.

54:19.460 --> 54:21.628
I saw them in my basement.

54:21.630 --> 54:23.829
These are, wait a second.

54:23.831 --> 54:24.664
No, wait.

54:24.666 --> 54:26.334
Where are you going?

54:29.004 --> 54:30.405
Check this out.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.275
That's them.

54:34.409 --> 54:35.575
The Three Mothers.

54:35.577 --> 54:36.643
You say you saw them?

54:36.645 --> 54:37.877
Not in the book.

54:37.879 --> 54:38.778
In real life?

54:38.780 --> 54:41.214
Yeah, in my basement

54:41.216 --> 54:42.882
Okay, who are
The Three Mothers?

54:42.884 --> 54:44.618
Notorious child killers.

54:44.620 --> 54:46.420
Bled children dry.

54:46.422 --> 54:47.988
The lucky ones died fast.

54:47.990 --> 54:50.157
The others, they'd
bleed for weeks.

54:50.159 --> 54:52.727
Legend has it that the
townspeople of Salem

54:52.729 --> 54:54.962
caught them and
sentenced them to death.

54:54.964 --> 54:56.498
One was burned at the stake.

54:56.500 --> 54:58.565
One hanged and one drowned.

54:58.567 --> 55:02.336
They died watching
each other suffer.

55:02.338 --> 55:04.071
Kevin, how did they kill Ronnie?

55:04.073 --> 55:05.039
Describe it to me.

55:05.041 --> 55:06.474
No, no!

55:06.476 --> 55:08.343
They tied him upside down.

55:08.345 --> 55:10.979
They were whispering
something to him

55:10.981 --> 55:12.514
and then they were
about to cut him.

55:12.516 --> 55:13.348
Where?

55:13.350 --> 55:14.182
Cut him where?

55:14.184 --> 55:15.016
Dude, Vincent!

55:15.018 --> 55:15.850
His throat.

55:15.852 --> 55:17.486
Please.

55:17.488 --> 55:18.654
I believe him.

55:21.024 --> 55:22.991
Okay, you know what,

55:22.993 --> 55:25.761
a lot of crazy stuff
has happened, right?

55:25.763 --> 55:27.765
And I can't find Ronnie.

55:29.567 --> 55:31.467
Ronnie's dead.

55:31.469 --> 55:34.236
Okay, I can't explain
what's happening,

55:34.238 --> 55:37.374
but I'm sure that there's some...

55:37.376 --> 55:38.408
No!

55:38.410 --> 55:39.745
You're not sure.

55:41.879 --> 55:42.715
Please.

55:50.121 --> 55:52.089
"Get the
lanterns, Martin."

55:52.091 --> 55:54.424
"Save the day, Martin."

55:54.426 --> 55:55.260
Martin.

56:04.003 --> 56:04.839
Hi.

56:10.310 --> 56:11.143
Shhh.

56:57.526 --> 56:58.861
Help!

57:00.362 --> 57:01.762
Did you not just hear that?

57:01.764 --> 57:02.897
What?

57:02.899 --> 57:03.731
Help me!

57:14.277 --> 57:17.212
Please get this
crazy bitch off me!

57:17.214 --> 57:18.413
The child.

57:18.415 --> 57:21.415
Give us the child,
and you won't be hurt.

57:21.417 --> 57:24.185
We've already tasted his blood.

57:24.187 --> 57:26.423
Soon we will bleed him dry.

57:28.826 --> 57:30.025
When it is our hour,

57:30.027 --> 57:31.693
we will make him suffer.

57:31.695 --> 57:33.865
Leave now or die with him.

57:34.933 --> 57:36.534
Stay right there.

57:38.303 --> 57:39.502
You're right.

57:39.504 --> 57:41.270
It'll be more fun this way.

57:41.272 --> 57:42.873
We've only just gotten started.

57:49.481 --> 57:50.415
No, no, no!

58:03.095 --> 58:04.528
No, stay right there!

58:04.530 --> 58:05.662
Amber?

58:05.664 --> 58:06.497
Get up.

58:06.499 --> 58:07.699
You're okay.

58:07.701 --> 58:08.532
My fingers!

58:09.468 --> 58:11.802
She bit my fucking fingers off!

58:34.995 --> 58:35.928
Kevin!

58:35.930 --> 58:37.262
Indomidae Brachtus Mona.

58:42.370 --> 58:43.402
You okay, little one?

58:43.404 --> 58:44.537
Was that them?

58:44.539 --> 58:46.171
Was that...

58:46.173 --> 58:47.275
Yes.

58:48.476 --> 58:49.976
What the fuck was that?

58:49.978 --> 58:51.745
An incantation.

58:51.747 --> 58:53.312
What the fuck?

58:54.583 --> 58:56.016
That bitch!

58:56.018 --> 58:56.851
Fuck!

58:57.852 --> 58:59.285
Give me back my finger, bitch!

58:59.287 --> 59:01.320
Kevin, Kevin, come on!

59:02.824 --> 59:03.723
It's jammed or something.

59:03.725 --> 59:04.658
I can't...

59:04.660 --> 59:06.895
That fucking psycho bitch!

59:07.796 --> 59:09.298
Stand back, Rod!

59:14.437 --> 59:15.736
Oh shit!

59:15.738 --> 59:17.972
Now that's clever.

59:17.974 --> 59:19.340
It looks like a rune,

59:19.342 --> 59:20.176
a spell.

59:21.276 --> 59:23.543
The house is bound to it.

59:23.545 --> 59:25.646
The doors will open on the
outside but not the inside.

59:25.648 --> 59:27.682
So what we're
trapped in here now?

59:27.684 --> 59:29.051
Oh not just us.

59:29.053 --> 59:30.284
Them too.

59:30.286 --> 59:32.553
Until someone opens the
door from the outside,

59:32.555 --> 59:34.155
no one is going anywhere.

59:34.157 --> 59:35.256
And who the fuck are you?

59:35.258 --> 59:36.257
I'm Vincent.

59:36.259 --> 59:37.695
I live next door.

59:38.796 --> 59:40.662
He knows about this stuff.

59:40.664 --> 59:42.331
What stuff?

59:42.333 --> 59:43.432
Does anyone's phone work?

59:43.434 --> 59:44.666
We can call the cops.

59:44.668 --> 59:45.867
And what are
we gonna tell them?

59:45.869 --> 59:46.668
That we're in the middle
of robbing a house?

59:46.670 --> 59:47.469
Who gives a shit?

59:47.471 --> 59:48.772
They'll open the door.

59:50.140 --> 59:50.975
Kitchen.

59:59.818 --> 01:00:00.652
Hello?

01:00:01.853 --> 01:00:03.288
Martin.

01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:05.789
Who is this?

01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:07.390
Martin.

01:00:07.392 --> 01:00:09.626
No, who the fuck is this?

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:11.027
Martin.

01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.861
Fuck you!

01:00:14.299 --> 01:00:16.432
Have you seen them before?

01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:17.535
I think so.

01:00:18.704 --> 01:00:21.839
But you've
seen them, right?

01:00:21.841 --> 01:00:23.273
Landline is fucked.

01:00:23.275 --> 01:00:24.742
Does anyone have service?

01:00:24.744 --> 01:00:25.676
Master bathroom.

01:00:25.678 --> 01:00:26.911
It's the only room with service.

01:00:26.913 --> 01:00:27.578
They won't let
you call for help.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.146
Shut up!

01:00:29.148 --> 01:00:30.515
What is with you, man?

01:00:30.517 --> 01:00:31.916
I mean, who are you anyway?

01:00:31.918 --> 01:00:33.684
I'm an expert on witches.

01:00:33.686 --> 01:00:34.986
An expert, okay?

01:00:34.988 --> 01:00:35.819
Who the fuck are you?

01:00:35.821 --> 01:00:36.654
Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:36.656 --> 01:00:37.856
Enough.

01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:40.226
Just got make the call, okay?

01:00:43.463 --> 01:00:45.330
You've seen them?

01:00:45.332 --> 01:00:46.966
I think so.

01:00:46.968 --> 01:00:50.002
And in your dreams they
never get you, right?

01:00:50.004 --> 01:00:50.805
No.

01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:53.472
So why not?

01:00:53.474 --> 01:00:55.074
How do you stay away?

01:00:55.076 --> 01:00:55.910
Maybe,

01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:00.213
maybe we can use it.

01:01:02.016 --> 01:01:04.118
My mom always shows up.

01:01:05.586 --> 01:01:08.523
Right when they're
about to get me.

01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:13.529
She tells me to run
and don't look back.

01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:16.265
I run and I run,

01:01:18.233 --> 01:01:20.568
and I never never look back.

01:01:25.808 --> 01:01:27.007
And then I wake up.

01:01:37.887 --> 01:01:39.123
You smell nice.

01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:46.027
Guys, I'd love to
see that book now.

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:53.135
9-1-1.

01:01:53.137 --> 01:01:54.002
What is your emergency?

01:01:54.004 --> 01:01:54.837
Hello?

01:01:54.839 --> 01:01:55.771
Yes!

01:01:55.773 --> 01:01:56.905
Yes, thank you, thank you.

01:01:56.907 --> 01:01:58.741
My girlfriend's
friend, he's been hurt.

01:01:58.743 --> 01:02:00.242
He's bleeding.

01:02:00.244 --> 01:02:04.781
Send paramedics, fire trucks,
police, just send everyone!

01:02:04.783 --> 01:02:07.117
Okay, I'm sending
the request to dispatch now.

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:08.717
Try to apply first aid

01:02:08.719 --> 01:02:11.086
and in the meantime keep
the wounded area elevated.

01:02:11.088 --> 01:02:11.920
Great.

01:02:11.922 --> 01:02:13.355
Thank you.

01:02:13.357 --> 01:02:14.858
Thank you so much.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.092
What
about the child?

01:02:16.094 --> 01:02:18.260
How long do think
you think before you...

01:02:18.262 --> 01:02:22.499
Bring the
child down to the basement.

01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:24.667
Bring the child down
to the basement.

01:02:24.669 --> 01:02:26.137
What?

01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:30.141
Bring the
child down to the basement.

01:02:30.143 --> 01:02:33.246
Bring the child down
to the basement.

01:02:37.582 --> 01:02:40.084
Now this is incredible.

01:02:40.086 --> 01:02:41.921
Absolutely incredible.

01:02:44.991 --> 01:02:48.827
So this incantation,
it hurts them, right?

01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:50.327
Not in the slightest.

01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:51.496
But it does block their spells,

01:02:51.498 --> 01:02:53.665
which seems to
really piss them off.

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:55.433
And you're sure
that it's gonna work?

01:02:55.435 --> 01:02:57.235
Yeah, you just saw me use it.

01:02:57.237 --> 01:03:00.071
Plus, look, it's here
in the book, too.

01:03:00.073 --> 01:03:01.106
It's witchcraft.

01:03:01.108 --> 01:03:02.073
They're witches.

01:03:02.075 --> 01:03:04.509
They gotta play by the rules.

01:03:07.148 --> 01:03:09.882
That's what they
did to Ronnie.

01:03:09.884 --> 01:03:10.950
That's not gonna
happen to you, okay?

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:13.621
We're not gonna let that happen.

01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:17.023
What if we just just hide,

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:18.524
wait for Ted to get home,

01:03:18.526 --> 01:03:20.725
and for him to open the door?

01:03:20.727 --> 01:03:21.928
Maybe.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:23.062
But that girl said something

01:03:23.064 --> 01:03:25.264
about an hour nearing,

01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:26.098
"our hour".

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.333
The witching hour.

01:03:27.335 --> 01:03:28.701
Midnight.

01:03:28.703 --> 01:03:30.137
If they have a ritual
that involves Kevin,

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.437
that's when it will begin.

01:03:31.439 --> 01:03:32.272
So we've got...

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:38.645
I take it calling
the cops didn't work?

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:39.481
No!

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:43.650
Asshole.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:55.163
Oh fuck!

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:55.997
Fuck!

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.465
Fuck you!

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.804
I'd like to see you
try that shit again!

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:02.804
Hey!

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.306
You're the expert, right?

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:07.109
Then why in the hell is
she still fucking with me?

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.343
That's witches for you.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.279
They tend to play
with their food.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:15.184
Or, in this case, use their
food to play with their food.

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:16.318
Okay, okay.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.319
So what about the book?

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.687
It's very interesting.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.155
It's a testament to the Mothers,

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:22.424
written by their followers
after their death.

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:25.262
Their ashes were collected
and turned into ink,

01:04:25.264 --> 01:04:27.463
the ink used in the book,

01:04:27.465 --> 01:04:29.666
They're not just in the book.

01:04:29.668 --> 01:04:31.169
They are the book.

01:04:33.138 --> 01:04:34.973
Or so the legend goes.

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:38.008
Okay, so how do we stop them?

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:39.441
No, nothing yet.

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:40.977
Wait, hold up.

01:04:40.979 --> 01:04:42.579
Why in the hell would they
tell us how to stop them?

01:04:42.581 --> 01:04:44.148
I mean you just
said that the book

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:46.783
was written by their
followers, right?

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:47.952
Okay, yeah, yeah.

01:04:47.954 --> 01:04:50.288
Okay, so, so we learn
the incantation,

01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:53.459
we hide out and just
hope for the best.

01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:55.993
What incantation?

01:04:55.995 --> 01:04:58.329
Indomidae Brachtus Mona.

01:04:58.331 --> 01:04:59.596
Repeat it.

01:04:59.598 --> 01:05:00.463
Indominame Brachtus...

01:05:00.465 --> 01:05:01.299
No, no.

01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:02.266
Listen, listen.

01:05:02.268 --> 01:05:04.271
Indomidae Brachtus Mona.

01:05:05.306 --> 01:05:06.837
All right, together.

01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:08.106
This is a joke.

01:05:08.108 --> 01:05:09.507
Indomidae Brachtose...

01:05:09.509 --> 01:05:12.144
No, no, no, both wrong.

01:05:12.146 --> 01:05:13.981
How do you spell it?

01:05:15.749 --> 01:05:18.351
Indomidae Brachtus Mona...

01:05:18.353 --> 01:05:19.953
Why are we even
listening to this guy?

01:05:19.955 --> 01:05:21.186
Don't you live in a garage?

01:05:21.188 --> 01:05:23.288
- Jesus.
- Holy shit, the garage

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:24.723
You use a button to
get into the garage,

01:05:24.725 --> 01:05:26.158
and the door slides up, right?

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.427
That's how you get in and out.

01:05:27.429 --> 01:05:28.794
Yeah, I live in a garage.

01:05:28.796 --> 01:05:29.728
Get over it.

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:30.662
No, no, think about it.

01:05:30.664 --> 01:05:31.965
We get to the garage.

01:05:31.967 --> 01:05:33.266
We raise the door.

01:05:33.268 --> 01:05:36.736
I mean the spell, it
turns doors into walls

01:05:36.738 --> 01:05:39.539
so if we can get the door
to slide up, no walls!

01:05:40.376 --> 01:05:41.208
Hell yeah.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.042
I mean, right?

01:05:42.044 --> 01:05:43.410
It could work.

01:05:43.412 --> 01:05:45.080
Let's do it.

01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:51.118
Okay, okay.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.554
This will be easy.

01:05:53.756 --> 01:05:56.592
You just gotta be
fast, really fast.

01:05:57.626 --> 01:05:59.128
To outrun witches,

01:06:02.332 --> 01:06:04.401
because witches are real.

01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:06.336
Oh God.

01:06:31.162 --> 01:06:32.294
Figures.

01:06:32.296 --> 01:06:35.500
You said you wouldn't
leave me again.

01:06:38.535 --> 01:06:39.769
Someone's gotta go.

01:06:39.771 --> 01:06:40.603
I'll go.

01:06:42.073 --> 01:06:43.806
You'll go?

01:06:43.808 --> 01:06:44.807
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:45.641
Did you want to?

01:06:45.643 --> 01:06:46.476
No, no, I don't.

01:06:46.478 --> 01:06:47.576
I'm good.

01:06:47.578 --> 01:06:49.679
Do you guys have dibs?

01:06:49.681 --> 01:06:50.515
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:51.815
No, nope.

01:06:51.817 --> 01:06:52.582
Okay.

01:06:52.584 --> 01:06:53.520
Well sweet.

01:06:54.421 --> 01:06:55.987
Then yeah, I'll go.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.724
I'm really the
only one qualified.

01:07:00.726 --> 01:07:01.992
I can protect myself.

01:07:01.994 --> 01:07:03.226
Right.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.262
'Cause you know all the
fancy words and stuff.

01:07:04.264 --> 01:07:05.097
Shut up.

01:07:06.965 --> 01:07:08.567
Thank you, Vincent.

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:12.105
Uh, ummm, sorry, uh,

01:07:13.573 --> 01:07:16.208
so you're gonna run all the
way down and unlock the door

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:19.478
and then continue to run
all the way back up here

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.112
without having a heart attack?

01:07:21.114 --> 01:07:25.051
We need someone fast,
someone athletic, someone

01:07:27.288 --> 01:07:28.122
healthy.

01:07:35.129 --> 01:07:37.029
Indomidae Brachtus Mona.

01:07:37.031 --> 01:07:38.264
Indomidae Brachtus Mona.

01:07:38.266 --> 01:07:40.100
Okay, you can't
just keep saying it.

01:07:40.102 --> 01:07:41.568
Fuck off.

01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:43.103
It's like punching someone.

01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:48.042
You get a nice punch in at the
start, then you'll get tired.

01:07:48.642 --> 01:07:49.576
I forgot.

01:07:49.578 --> 01:07:51.077
You're the expert and the hero.

01:07:51.079 --> 01:07:54.247
There's an innocent girl
and a little kid up there.

01:07:54.249 --> 01:07:55.583
It's our responsibility to...

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:02.323
We keep moving.

01:08:02.325 --> 01:08:04.391
Don't look back.

01:08:11.267 --> 01:08:12.466
That's it, right?

01:08:12.468 --> 01:08:13.334
It doesn't work.

01:08:13.336 --> 01:08:14.602
Let's just go.

01:08:14.604 --> 01:08:16.337
This is organized
just like my garage.

01:08:16.339 --> 01:08:18.205
There's a breaker in there.

01:08:18.207 --> 01:08:19.773
You do it.

01:08:19.774 --> 01:08:22.843
I'll hit the button
as soon as we're good.

01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:23.679
Go.

01:08:47.971 --> 01:08:49.171
Martin.

01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:50.841
Did you hear that?

01:08:52.777 --> 01:08:53.975
Behind you!

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:57.081
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:01.417
Indomidae, Indomidae, no!

01:09:01.419 --> 01:09:03.219
Please, no, no!

01:09:18.205 --> 01:09:19.636
Where's Vincent?

01:09:19.639 --> 01:09:21.104
What happened?

01:09:21.106 --> 01:09:22.339
He fucked up, okay!

01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:24.207
There's no power down there!

01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:26.644
He almost got me killed!

01:09:40.261 --> 01:09:41.093
Oh God!

01:09:51.339 --> 01:09:55.009
There's another garage
in the pool house.

01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:02.284
Finley?

01:10:05.821 --> 01:10:07.521
Come on, Kevin!

01:10:07.523 --> 01:10:09.556
Come on, come on, go!

01:10:09.558 --> 01:10:10.923
You okay, you okay?

01:10:10.925 --> 01:10:12.359
There's something
wrong with Finley.

01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:13.761
Martin?

01:10:35.885 --> 01:10:37.184
Amber!

01:10:37.186 --> 01:10:38.819
Behind you!

01:10:46.697 --> 01:10:47.831
Bitch!

01:11:37.284 --> 01:11:38.350
Amber!

01:11:38.352 --> 01:11:39.584
Amber, please!

01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:41.821
Kevin, no!

01:11:41.823 --> 01:11:43.355
Kevin, no!

01:11:43.357 --> 01:11:44.658
Amber!

01:11:50.397 --> 01:11:51.698
Fucking bitch!

01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.501
How you like that shit, huh?

01:11:55.503 --> 01:11:56.435
Baby?

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:58.870
Baby, why are you hurting me?

01:11:58.872 --> 01:12:00.172
Lindsey?

01:12:11.252 --> 01:12:12.184
Fight it, Lindsey!

01:12:12.186 --> 01:12:13.052
No!

01:12:13.054 --> 01:12:14.320
Don't do it!

01:12:14.322 --> 01:12:15.256
No, no, no!

01:12:18.694 --> 01:12:19.927
No, please, no!

01:12:39.883 --> 01:12:40.717
Hello?

01:12:45.989 --> 01:12:47.457
Amber, we're home.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.629
Oh, what the fuck?

01:12:54.398 --> 01:12:55.232
Ronnie?

01:12:59.436 --> 01:13:00.270
Ronnie?

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.274
Ronnie?

01:13:07.211 --> 01:13:08.143
We have to call the police.

01:13:08.145 --> 01:13:09.011
It's in the kitchen.

01:13:09.013 --> 01:13:11.146
Knock yourself out.

01:13:22.059 --> 01:13:22.892
9-1-1.

01:13:22.894 --> 01:13:23.726
What's your emergency?

01:13:23.728 --> 01:13:25.194
Oh, thank God!

01:13:25.196 --> 01:13:26.196
My son is missing and the
house has been robbed!

01:13:26.198 --> 01:13:27.664
We just went to dinner.

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:28.465
We left the kids with
Amber, with the Gilfords,

01:13:28.467 --> 01:13:29.699
and there's blood!

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:31.234
Just slow
down, ma'am, all right?

01:13:35.475 --> 01:13:37.006
So there's a boy missing?

01:13:37.008 --> 01:13:37.842
Yes!

01:13:37.844 --> 01:13:39.310
My son is missing!

01:13:39.312 --> 01:13:40.511
Ma'am, I'm
gonna need you to calm down.

01:13:40.513 --> 01:13:41.913
Are you sure your boy
didn't deserve it?

01:13:41.915 --> 01:13:43.647
Actions have consequences.

01:13:43.649 --> 01:13:44.482
What?

01:13:44.484 --> 01:13:45.716
I...

01:13:45.718 --> 01:13:47.083
Do you want
to see your son again?

01:13:47.085 --> 01:13:48.819
Yes, I wanna see my son again!

01:13:51.591 --> 01:13:52.358
Oh my...

01:13:59.166 --> 01:13:59.999
Ronnie?

01:14:00.901 --> 01:14:02.400
Baby?

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:46.113
Ronnie?

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:49.784
Ronnie, Ronnie, are you here?

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:51.386
Help me, Mommy!

01:14:51.388 --> 01:14:53.454
Are you in here?

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:54.856
Mommy,
they're hurting me.

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.390
Ronnie, where are you?

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:58.191
I hear you, baby.

01:14:58.193 --> 01:15:02.032
Don't worry,
Mommy, you'll find me.

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:06.037
Ronnie?

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:11.943
You'll find me.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.761
It worked.

01:16:04.297 --> 01:16:05.296
Hey man, call the cops!

01:16:08.668 --> 01:16:09.502
Fuck.

01:16:14.407 --> 01:16:15.241
Rod?

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:17.375
Rod?

01:16:17.377 --> 01:16:18.311
No, no, no!

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.246
No, no, no!

01:16:21.248 --> 01:16:22.850
What the fuck, Ted?

01:16:23.817 --> 01:16:25.885
He, he came out of nowhere,

01:16:25.887 --> 01:16:29.187
and I, I and who the
fuck is this guy anyway?

01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:31.156
It was self defense!

01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:32.824
He needed help.

01:16:32.826 --> 01:16:34.996
We need, I need help, Ted!

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.056
Ronnie went in
the office, right?

01:17:02.058 --> 01:17:03.691
It's happening.

01:17:03.693 --> 01:17:04.658
It's a paranormal event.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.859
Don't you see?

01:17:05.861 --> 01:17:08.295
You wanted this to happen?

01:17:08.297 --> 01:17:10.598
The Three Mothers
target children.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.599
I needed a kid.

01:17:11.601 --> 01:17:12.534
That's all.

01:17:12.536 --> 01:17:14.102
To see what would happen.

01:17:14.104 --> 01:17:16.471
And Ronnie well,
he's predictable.

01:17:16.473 --> 01:17:17.472
Kevin!

01:17:17.474 --> 01:17:19.242
Kevin found the book.

01:17:20.644 --> 01:17:21.712
No, that's,

01:17:23.146 --> 01:17:26.316
the odds of that
happening are so low.

01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:31.654
You are a sick
fuck, you know that?

01:17:31.656 --> 01:17:35.256
He was supposed
to stay in his room.

01:17:35.258 --> 01:17:36.559
He's always in his room.

01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:38.327
I can barely get him to
come down for dinner.

01:17:38.329 --> 01:17:39.662
How was I supposed to know?

01:17:50.641 --> 01:17:52.408
I'd never hurt him.

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:53.679
I'm his father.

01:17:56.415 --> 01:17:57.816
No, you're not.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.787
What time is it?

01:18:06.926 --> 01:18:08.058
Are you done?

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.060
We only have 15
minutes until midnight.

01:18:10.062 --> 01:18:11.195
Their ritual, of course.

01:18:11.197 --> 01:18:12.329
Where's the book?

01:18:12.331 --> 01:18:13.430
It's not in my office.

01:18:13.432 --> 01:18:15.133
Martin took it downstairs.

01:18:15.135 --> 01:18:16.266
Martin?

01:18:16.268 --> 01:18:17.668
Nevermind, that's fine.

01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:18.536
It'll be even better.

01:18:18.538 --> 01:18:19.403
Better?

01:18:19.405 --> 01:18:20.605
The footage.

01:18:20.607 --> 01:18:21.806
We'll go right into
the lion's den.

01:18:21.808 --> 01:18:23.808
It'll be way more
interesting this way.

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:25.043
Look.

01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:26.444
Legend has it that
the book was printed

01:18:26.446 --> 01:18:27.613
in the ashes of The Mothers.

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:28.814
They're not just...

01:18:28.816 --> 01:18:29.615
In the book,
they are the book.

01:18:29.617 --> 01:18:30.549
So what?

01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:31.616
Destroy the book,

01:18:31.618 --> 01:18:33.518
destroy the Mothers.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.685
That was my plan all along.

01:18:34.687 --> 01:18:38.056
I never expected anyone
to you know, die,

01:18:38.058 --> 01:18:39.792
except for Ronnie.

01:18:39.794 --> 01:18:42.561
Yeah, so how do
we destroy the book?

01:18:42.563 --> 01:18:45.297
The same way you destroy
a witch, you burn it.

01:18:45.299 --> 01:18:46.431
Are you sure?

01:18:46.433 --> 01:18:47.399
We can't use more bullets?

01:18:47.401 --> 01:18:48.868
There's nothing else?

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:50.436
No, we don't even know
if a bullet will hurt them.

01:18:50.438 --> 01:18:52.372
But burning a
book will hurt them?

01:18:52.374 --> 01:18:54.507
This isn't cops and
robbers, okay sweetie?

01:18:54.509 --> 01:18:56.176
This is a paranormal event,

01:18:56.178 --> 01:18:58.477
and I am a paranormal
investigator.

01:18:58.479 --> 01:18:59.712
I'm the expert here.

01:18:59.714 --> 01:19:01.848
So either you trust
me, or you wing it

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.284
and hope for the best.

01:19:39.456 --> 01:19:40.291
Badass.

01:19:44.428 --> 01:19:47.729
This is once-in-a-lifetime
footage.

01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:50.734
Ted Hooper, Paranormal
Investigator.

01:19:52.369 --> 01:19:53.271
This is it.

01:19:54.438 --> 01:19:58.042
What evil lurks in the
basement of my own home?

01:19:59.278 --> 01:20:00.443
We find out...

01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.982
Tonight.

01:20:16.996 --> 01:20:19.663
Oh fuck, fuck!

01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:03.345
Shhh.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.235
Now watch this.

01:21:36.612 --> 01:21:38.413
Nothing's happening.

01:21:38.415 --> 01:21:41.183
Why is nothing happening?

01:21:41.185 --> 01:21:41.986
Oh God!

01:22:45.118 --> 01:22:45.919
Kevin!

01:22:48.555 --> 01:22:50.021
Okay, okay, okay!

01:22:50.023 --> 01:22:50.855
Okay, come on!

01:22:50.857 --> 01:22:52.291
Stop, stop, look at me.

01:22:52.293 --> 01:22:55.026
Okay, we're gonna run and we're
not gonna look back, okay?

01:22:55.028 --> 01:22:56.196
Okay, come on.

01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:11.777
Indomidae Brachtus Mona!

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:14.181
Indomidae Brachtus Mona!

01:23:23.091 --> 01:23:23.925
Amber!

01:23:24.859 --> 01:23:25.693
Amber!

01:23:29.398 --> 01:23:30.232
Please!

01:23:46.216 --> 01:23:48.952
Don't
look back, Kevin!

01:23:57.428 --> 01:23:58.262
You.

01:24:00.898 --> 01:24:01.731
Yeah.

01:24:18.450 --> 01:24:20.983
You have any family nearby?

01:24:20.985 --> 01:24:23.088
Anyone you can stay with?

01:24:27.493 --> 01:24:28.326
Right.

01:24:41.973 --> 01:24:43.174
Damn kids.

01:24:43.176 --> 01:24:44.774
Partying at all
hours of the night.

01:24:44.776 --> 01:24:47.344
God damn, can't get a
night's sleep around here.

01:24:49.248 --> 01:24:52.051
What the hell's
going on in there?

01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:16.173
