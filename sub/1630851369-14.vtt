Did you go out
with my daughter?

- There are several tumors.
- Is it malignant?

Give her 50 mics

05:17.969 --> 05:19.231
Let's get a pelvis x-ray,

and let's send her up to CT
for a pan scan,

05:20.755 --> 05:22.147
and make sure we add
a tox to her blood and urine.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.323
Yep.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.196
Dr. Shentu, why don't
you see this through?

Uh, certainly.

you run point.

a pair of scrubs.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.638
Okay.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.991
Did you just assign
the compliance officer

05:40.035 --> 05:41.297
to a medical case?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.777
He's a critical care doctor

05:42.820 --> 05:44.474
who's credentialed at Med.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.607
He's a bureaucrat.
A suit.

Nevertheless, I know
you'll be accommodating.

05:51.612 --> 05:52.830

06:10.805 --> 06:12.197
Given everything we've seen,

06:12.241 --> 06:14.765
we think you have a condition
called fibromyalgia.

Let's give her
another 50 of fentanyl.

Fibromyalgia?

We've seen it
in long-haul COVID patients

06:22.469 --> 06:24.775
like yourself; there's
even a name, "Fibro-COVID."

06:24.819 --> 06:26.342
What causes it?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.344
We think it's due
to a problem in the way

06:28.388 --> 06:29.650
that the spinal cord
and the brain

06:29.693 --> 06:30.868
process pain signals.

06:30.912 --> 06:31.869
It's not life-threatening,
but it is--

06:31.913 --> 06:33.610
It's terrible.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.264
We need
a rheumatology consult,

06:35.307 --> 06:36.700
but for right now,
we're giving you

06:36.744 --> 06:38.006
more pain meds
so you can get some rest,

06:38.049 --> 06:38.963
all right?
- [groans]

06:39.007 --> 06:40.008
The good news, Gia?

06:40.051 --> 06:41.313
According to your scans,

06:41.357 --> 06:42.967
there were no serious injuries
with your crash.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.796
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.277
I should have never
driven myself.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.279
Dr. Taylor and I are
just happy you're safe

06:50.322 --> 06:51.759
and getting
the treatment you need.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.115
- Fibromyalgia.
- That's tough.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.290
Yeah.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.205
So how are you thinking
of treating her?

07:03.248 --> 07:05.425
There's data on patients
responding very well

07:05.468 --> 07:07.644
to Xyrem.
- Xyrem?

07:07.688 --> 07:11.866
As I recall, it's not
FDA-approved for fibromyalgia.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.128
- Right.
- Yeah, it's only approved

07:13.171 --> 07:14.695
for cataplexy and narcolepsy.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.000
We'd be using it off-label.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.306
And per your new mandates,

07:17.349 --> 07:20.222
our doctors can't prescribe
off-label meds

07:20.265 --> 07:21.876
without the patient's consent.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.921
And she's sedated now,
so she can't.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.880
Well, then as soon
as she wakes,

07:25.923 --> 07:27.490
we'll, uh, explain
the situation

07:27.534 --> 07:29.274
and ask for consent.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.973
Yeah, seems like
your only option.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.979
Dr. Scott!

I understand we're doing
a transplant

07:39.154 --> 07:40.460

got the case, man.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.637
Well, we're gonna take
good care of her, all right?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.116

Help us treat him?

08:57.188 --> 09:00.017
Terrell's kind of a mystery.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.542
When we were kids,
he was funny, smart.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.673
Then he drops out,

09:03.717 --> 09:05.980
starts hanging
with the wrong crowd.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.548
[sighs] After that,
things went downhill.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.290
It's tough to see
a life fall apart.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.772
He's been MIA for a while.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.339
I'm gonna go tell
his wife he's here.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.384
- Yeah.
- All right, thanks.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.651
Morning.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.827
Hey.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.568
Here you go.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.960
I hear that Stevie's
going back to Michigan

09:30.004 --> 09:31.005
to be with her husband?

09:31.048 --> 09:32.441
Yeah, so?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.010
Don't start with me.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.839
Where is Trini?

09:38.882 --> 09:40.014
They're short-staffed
at the ICU.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.668
She's covering.
- Well, I need her.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.539
She's supposed to make
a house call with me.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.323
Oh. I'll go.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.890
Trini knows the patient,
you don't.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.370
What?

09:48.413 --> 09:49.763
Am I not the nurse
with more experience

09:49.806 --> 09:51.634
than anyone else down here?

09:51.678 --> 09:53.505
Sorry, Nurse Lockwood.
I'm sure you've seen it all.

09:53.549 --> 09:54.811
I'm grateful
for your assistance.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.857
Huh.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.207
Charge Nurse Lockwood.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.426
You're in a good mood.
- So are you.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.211
Mm-hmm.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.430
Dr. Hammer.
Good news, huh?

10:05.474 --> 10:08.782
- What's that?
- Your mom.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.044
I was just up
in the Psych Ward.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.959
I saw
that they're discharging her.

- My mother's here?

10:24.058 --> 10:25.059
Why didn't you tell me?

10:25.102 --> 10:27.365
- I couldn't.
- Why?

10:27.409 --> 10:30.368
Because she gave me
express orders not to.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.631
Well, this doesn't
make any sense.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.893
Did you commit her?

10:32.936 --> 10:34.503
I'm sorry, I can't
discuss that with you.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.678
She's my mother!

10:35.722 --> 10:36.940
Doesn't matter, Stevie.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.986
She's a patient here,
and she has rights.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.248
Okay, where is she?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.902
- Stevie--
- This is ridiculous.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.251
Come on.

She's a little confused.

Right? She's--she's angry.

She's--she's hurt.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.497
But, um...

11:12.541 --> 11:14.151
how would you like
to handle this?

11:14.195 --> 11:15.631
What--what would you like
me to tell her?

- Dr. Halstead.
- Hey, Lenny.

- Hey.

Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

a healthy glow.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.610
Okay.

Well, we're gonna need
to open the box

But who's counting?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.174
He's also instructed me
more than once

13:04.218 --> 13:06.481
never to refer to him
as a polio victim.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.964

13:30.548 --> 13:32.463
Mm, I'm all ears.

13:32.507 --> 13:33.943
Nothing to tell.

13:33.987 --> 13:37.294
Ellis, I'm seeing

We need an EKG.
I brought one.

You good
for a few more minutes?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.745
Oh, yeah.
I need the exercise.

13:55.225 --> 13:59.186
So, um, your mom
has given me permission

13:59.229 --> 14:01.492
to share her medical history
with you.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.191
- Well, that's big of her.
- Have a seat, please.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.279
I'm okay.

14:07.063 --> 14:10.197
So you're mom
admitted herself.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.589
She was very depressed

14:11.633 --> 14:13.765
and, uh, was worried
about self-harm.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.071
Oh, my God.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.900
She has been diagnosed
with bipolar disorder.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.510
All right?
Which has, of course,

14:19.554 --> 14:22.035
been exacerbated
by her alcohol abuse.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.907
But admitting herself
to the hospital,

14:24.951 --> 14:27.475
seeking help--
really good sign.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.651
And I have to say,
with, uh--

14:29.694 --> 14:30.826
with treatment, right?

to reach her for weeks.

14:34.743 --> 14:35.918
No answer.

any of my calls.

I'm, um--
I'm moving back to Michigan,

14:41.793 --> 14:43.404

if I should.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.840
You know, Stevie,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.929
I'm so sorry that you've had
to go through this.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.063
Yet you were just fine
keeping me in the dark.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.763
Look, if it's
any consolation,

14:54.806 --> 14:56.330

14:56.373 --> 14:59.594
She's doing very well.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.292
Yeah, okay.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.164
But did it have to mean
cutting me out of her life?

Any more good news?

15:22.399 --> 15:23.879
EKG also shows low voltage,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.402

point to anything specific.

- Yeah.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.758
So Ellis, we gotta place a line
so we can collect your samples.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.064

15:35.108 --> 15:36.283
the only place
we have access to

15:36.326 --> 15:37.327
is your neck.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.250
Uh-huh. And shut up.

And we're in.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.393

15:59.436 --> 16:00.829
I'll have them run the tests.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.744

Hey, whatever's causing
your symptoms,

16:05.181 --> 16:07.009

16:18.368 --> 16:19.979

about it later.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.068
You need to get to the lab.

16:25.462 --> 16:26.594

16:26.637 --> 16:27.943
of the recipient's
abdominal cavity

16:27.987 --> 16:29.249
until we open her up.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.164
So we'll resect
the donor liver then

16:31.207 --> 16:32.513
according to the body weight ratio.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.384

You were passed out

to be treated surgically.

that I've been curious about.

Yeah?

22:26.910 --> 22:29.609
When you checked yourself
into a hospital

22:29.652 --> 22:31.872
where you knew
that Stevie worked,

22:31.915 --> 22:34.091

that eventually

22:34.135 --> 22:37.007
she was gonna find out
that you were here.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.182
I did.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.272
I--I wanted to be
near her,

22:41.316 --> 22:43.927

22:43.971 --> 22:45.799
eventually I would want
to see her.

But...

22:49.324 --> 22:51.370

22:51.413 --> 22:55.330
the more I felt I was
turning my life around,

22:55.374 --> 22:57.114
the less I wanted to see her.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.116

23:11.041 --> 23:13.522
Stevie always thinks I'll fail.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.437

plenty of reasons

23:15.481 --> 23:18.397

to be genetic,
