WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:04.830
So, then I said
to the eye doctor,

00:04.874 --> 00:06.789
"I can't see it.
I can't see it.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.965
I cansee it.
It's gone again."

00:09.009 --> 00:11.185
And he said I
was very special,

00:11.228 --> 00:14.144
and I might be eligible
for a service dog.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.321
Great story, Ma.

00:17.365 --> 00:20.672
And that clocked in
at just under 12 minutes.JOE: Yeah.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.413
And she's told it
to everybody--

00:22.457 --> 00:23.936
the grocer,
the pharmacist,

00:23.980 --> 00:26.809
some poor bastard who was
holding the door for her.Shh.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.246
Hey, there's
my thoughtful husband.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.900
All right, what is it?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.424
Last time
she called me thoughtful,

00:33.468 --> 00:35.687
I had to clean a pound of hair
out of the drain.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.908
That kid Julian is coming over
for a playdate with Emme,

00:38.951 --> 00:40.997
but I have to take Kate
to the doctor,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.216
so you have to watch them.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.826
Honey, I thought we agreed
no more Julian.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.349
That kid's the worst.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.090
Well, maybe while he's here,

00:47.134 --> 00:48.831
he'll see
how nice people behave,

00:48.874 --> 00:50.702
and it'll rub off on him.

00:50.746 --> 00:51.834
Yeah, only a mom
would say that.

00:51.877 --> 00:54.663
It's sweet
and packed full of lies.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.882
Dads know better.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.494
Joe, there's no difference
between moms and dads.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.629
Did you just roll your eyes?

01:04.673 --> 01:05.848
No, no, I was making sure

01:05.891 --> 01:07.371
all the light
bulbs are working.

01:09.373 --> 01:12.072
Okay, I know it's not popular
to say these days,

01:12.115 --> 01:15.205
but there are some things
dads are better at.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.164
The fact that we're so annoying

01:17.207 --> 01:20.384
and you keep marrying us
proves my point.

01:20.428 --> 01:23.605
We keep marrying you
because we're optimists

01:23.648 --> 01:26.390
and they make the lids
on pickle jars too tight.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.438
Well, he-he's not saying
dads are better than moms.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.092
You're not saying
that, are you?

01:32.135 --> 01:34.398
I said dads are better
at some things.

01:34.442 --> 01:37.619
Okay, moms are better
at some things, too.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.490
Okay. Like what?

01:39.534 --> 01:41.188
Don't say cooking
and cleaning, boy.

01:43.494 --> 01:46.367
Okay, uh, if we're the same,

01:46.410 --> 01:49.892
would you like to take care of
that dead squirrel on the roof?

01:49.935 --> 01:53.025
I would totally do it, but I
saw an owl fly away with it.

01:53.069 --> 01:56.159
And I know it was a mom owl
because she handled it

01:56.203 --> 01:58.118
like a boss
and then didn't spend

01:58.161 --> 02:00.076
the next two hours
bragging about it. Ha!

02:02.034 --> 02:04.472
Am I right?Hey, hey.

02:04.515 --> 02:08.128
Oh, high five. Fun.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.913
Sorry I'm late.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.742
I found a YouTube channel
of cats punching dogs.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.004
ANDI:
Ooh.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.180
Is it better
than chickens wearing pants?

02:17.224 --> 02:19.400
I don't want to get political.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.838
Now that Don is here,
I think we should talk

02:22.881 --> 02:24.187
about your knee surgery.Oh.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.146
It's in a couple of weeks,

02:26.189 --> 02:28.757
and the doctor said he should
hire a home health care nurse

02:28.800 --> 02:31.107
for during the rehab,
but he won't agree.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.328
I don't want some stranger in
my house going through my stuff.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.808
What stuff?
You mean that jug of nickels?

02:36.852 --> 02:39.115
Hey, when the world
goes to hell,

02:39.159 --> 02:42.031
the guy with the jug of nickels
is gonna be living like a king.

02:43.554 --> 02:47.297
I got a can of dimes.
Smaller and twice the value.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.777
You're a good boy, Donny.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.867
So, about this nurse...I'm not listening

02:51.910 --> 02:53.521
to any more
of this nurse stuff.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.044
I'll be with the TV.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.351
When I push mute,
it stops talking.

02:57.394 --> 03:01.920
Did he really leave,
or can I just not see him?

03:03.052 --> 03:05.272
He's going through the couch,
looking for nickels.

03:05.315 --> 03:08.536
Hey, Joe, I get half
of whatever you find.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.538
Boys,

03:10.581 --> 03:12.148
your dad's gonna need help,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.455
and I can't get him
to listen to reason.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.152
He was much easier to control

03:16.196 --> 03:18.459
when he was getting
that medical marijuana.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.679
Well, his dealer was 85.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.246
It was time to retire.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.250
Someone needs to talk him into
getting a nurse,

03:27.294 --> 03:29.774
and there's one person
at this table he'll listen to.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.254
Oh, Ma.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.647
That's why I need help

03:32.690 --> 03:35.127
from his favorite son... Don.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.956
What?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.525
: Dodged
that bullet.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.180
I heard it whistle past my ear,
and then it hit you.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.270
'Cause you're a good boy, Donny.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.497
Hey, that weird kid's
looking at you.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.542
Hello, Julian.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.109
Listen, buddy.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.068
Tell your kids
to give me the swing.

04:03.112 --> 04:06.202
Well, buddy,
you just had your turn,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.073
and it's Emme's turn now.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.250
I don't care.
I want to swing now.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.164
Hey, we have something
in common.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.645
I don't care, either.

04:14.689 --> 04:15.646
You're a butthead.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.258
You'rea butthead.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.216
Two against one.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.435
I guess you're a butthead.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.352
I really
don't like that kid.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.615
He does have some
good comebacks.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.138
So, listen,

04:29.181 --> 04:31.619
how am I supposed to get Dad
to agree to a home nurse?

04:31.662 --> 04:35.057
Good luck. He never changes
his mind about anything.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.885
He still drops his film
at the Foto Hut

04:36.928 --> 04:38.452
even though it's
a frozen yogurt place now.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.022
Hey, what are you
doing here?

04:44.066 --> 04:45.110
It's still your turn.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.851
Julian pushed me off the swing.

04:46.895 --> 04:50.290
What? Teddy, did you see this?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.292
Yeah, he pushed her right off.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.424
And you didn't do anything?

04:54.468 --> 04:56.296
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.952
Okay, Julian can't think

05:00.996 --> 05:04.216
pushing your little sister
is okay.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.958
Good thing there's a dad here.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.612
Teddy...

05:10.658 --> 05:12.355
...put him on the ground.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.270
I don't think Mom...

05:14.314 --> 05:15.967
Mom is not here.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.535
Put him on the ground.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.058
Okay.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.205
JULIAN:
Hey, you pushed me!

05:36.248 --> 05:37.206
He did it.

05:37.249 --> 05:40.252
My son defended his sister.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.299
Turn away, Don.
You might see me cry.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.706
So, Butterbean,
Daddy was totally right

05:58.749 --> 06:01.099
to tell Teddy
to put Julian on the ground.

06:01.143 --> 06:05.669
But that's not the kind of thing
that Mommy'd understand.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.019
Okay, so, let's play
a little game

06:08.063 --> 06:11.588
and see who can keep this secret
the longest.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.766
I bet I can keep it until I die.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.812
This is gonna be fun.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.554
Yeah. Okay, now, where's Teddy?
I have to tell him, too.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.817
He's outside playing basketball.Okay.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.122
And then I put Julian
on the ground,

06:24.166 --> 06:25.733
just like Dad told me to.
Right, Dad?

06:29.780 --> 06:32.435
Kids, go upstairs. I need
to talk to your father.

06:32.479 --> 06:35.046
Okay, when are we gonna be old
enough to stay for one of these?

06:35.090 --> 06:39.181
I'm gonna be married someday,
and I need to know how to do it.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.878
I'm going.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.014
You told Teddy to push Julian?

06:46.057 --> 06:47.581
Yes, I did.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.843
But we don't push people.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.932
No, youdon't,
'cause you're a mom.

06:50.975 --> 06:54.805
Come on, join the dads.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.808
It's fun over here.
We push people.

06:57.852 --> 07:02.726
There is no difference
between moms and dads.Look, will you just

07:02.770 --> 07:03.640
trust me on this?

07:03.684 --> 07:06.513
I handled it. It's dad time now.

07:06.556 --> 07:10.473
Okay, but this is gonna
blow up in your face.Hmm. Wha...?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.823
And when it does,
I'm gonna say "I told you so,"

07:12.867 --> 07:16.914
'cause that's something
moms are good at.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.655
I think I did society a favor.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.049
There's too many people
walking around out there

07:21.092 --> 07:22.746
who don't know they're boneheads

07:22.790 --> 07:26.489
because they didn't get put
on the ground as kids.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.273
Did you get put on the ground
as a kid?

07:28.317 --> 07:30.580
Of course I did.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.626
And yet you're still a bonehead.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.585
My point stands.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.369
But that was a good one.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.545
That was a good one, yeah.

07:38.588 --> 07:39.981
: Yeah,
that was a good one.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.939
DON:
So, I have to warn you.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.333
My dad's not real keen
on getting a nurse.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.161
Maybe you should
take off those scrubs

07:46.204 --> 07:47.989
so Joe isn't put off
when he walks in.

07:48.032 --> 07:51.122
Oh, I think he might be more
put off by a topless male nurse.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.429
Your résumé looks good.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.910
Ten years experience,
rave recommendations.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.216
At the top it says Funchy.
What's that?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.783
Oh, that's me.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.046
I've got "fun" right in my name.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.005
And "chi."

08:04.048 --> 08:06.703
Oh, here comes Joe.

08:06.747 --> 08:07.791
Let us do the talking.
We had to trick him

08:07.835 --> 08:08.879
to get him to come down here.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.838
Hey.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.710
Is this the guy selling the
secret recipe for Coca-Cola?

08:13.754 --> 08:17.192
Uh, we actually brought you here
to meet Funchy,

08:17.235 --> 08:20.325
a home health care nurse
for after your knee surgery.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
All right, listen up.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.763
I'm gonna talk to you

08:22.806 --> 08:24.591
the same way you talk
to everybody else.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.680
This is the guy.
He's your nurse,

08:26.723 --> 08:27.855
so no bellyaching.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.509
Okay, you win.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.901
Okay.I'll just grab a drink,

08:30.945 --> 08:32.947
and then we can
start the interview.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.694
Then he just walks out the door.
It was the perfect trick.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.304
It doesn't sound
like much of a trick.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.741
He just lied and left.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.961
Well, the simplicity is
what made it perfect.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.528
It's like ice. It's
just frozen water,

08:48.571 --> 08:50.312
but it changed the world.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.574
KATE:
Dad,

08:51.618 --> 08:53.271
Teddy was using
my mascara brush

08:53.315 --> 08:55.709
to make it look
like he had chest hair.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.102
I just wanted to see what
it's gonna look like on me.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.713
It's gonna look so good,

08:59.756 --> 09:01.976
you won't mind
that's it's also on your back.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.979
Oh, hey.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.807
Your Uncle Don told me
you pushed a kid down.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.984
All right, I don't need
any more lectures.MARCY: No, no.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.812
I'm proud.
He always seemed a little soft.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.379
Next time, go
for the windpipe.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.468
You can't fight if
you can't breathe.

09:17.469 --> 09:20.124
Wait, so you agree with me?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.779
Because Andi came out
pretty strong against it.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.608
She's soft,
just like Teddy used to be.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.872
Oh, there's my boy.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.178
I heard about what happened,

09:30.221 --> 09:32.920
and I wanted to give you
my old boxing gloves.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.009
If you need it to be over quick,
there's a hole inside

09:35.052 --> 09:36.619
where you can slip in
a couple of batteries.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.752
Kapowie! Hmm?

09:38.795 --> 09:41.581
All right, all right,
take it easy, champ.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.017
Thanks, Grandpa.

09:43.060 --> 09:43.974
Hey, Kate, you want
to go upstairs

09:44.018 --> 09:45.019
and see if I can
take a punch?

09:45.062 --> 09:47.064
Yeah, all right.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.199
Hey, guys.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.592
What's the occasion?

09:52.635 --> 09:56.030
Well, the occasion
is everybody agrees with me

09:56.073 --> 09:58.206
about Teddy putting that kid
on the ground.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.991
Yeah. You said it was
gonna blow up in my face,

10:01.035 --> 10:02.863
but the only thing on my face

10:02.906 --> 10:06.388
is a big smile
from being right.

10:06.431 --> 10:10.000
Am I really the only voice
of reason around here?

10:10.044 --> 10:12.002
I hate to say it, but
this all comes back

10:12.046 --> 10:15.876
to dads are just better
at some stuff than moms.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.181
It doesn't even make sense.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.401
Marcy agrees with you,
and she's a mom.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.011
Sorry. It's
not the gender.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.447
It's how your
relationship works.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.885
And in our relationship,
he's the mom.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.104
You tell 'em,
Big Daddy.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.107
ADAM:
Did you get Dad

10:30.151 --> 10:31.718
to agree to that nurse yet?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.241
Or did he pull
another Mission: Impossible

10:33.284 --> 10:35.286
and just walk out
right in front of you?

10:35.330 --> 10:38.072
Don't worry about me. I still
got a few tricks up my sleeve.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.856
Yeah? If you don't
get dad a nurse,

10:39.900 --> 10:42.076
the only thing up your sleeve
is gonna be sudsy water

10:42.119 --> 10:43.425
when you're giving Dad
a sponge bath.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.862
Maybe I'll hold on to
these nurse résumés.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.212
Now that I'm single,
I don't have anyone

10:48.256 --> 10:50.214
to take care of me
if something happens.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.955
Plus, the company would be nice.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.088
I wish they had a thing
for single guys

10:54.131 --> 10:55.306
where you could pay someone

10:55.350 --> 10:57.178
to hang out with you
on lonely nights.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.268
They have that.

11:00.311 --> 11:03.575
Yeah, they'll even dress up
like a nurse if you want.

11:05.012 --> 11:05.969
Hi.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.536
Hi, honey.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.103
I'm surprised you came
into work today.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.583
Considering how right
I was about Teddy,

11:11.627 --> 11:13.890
I thought
you might call in wrong.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.631
Well, you'd be wrong.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.546
Yeah, 'cause I just had
an interesting conversation

11:17.589 --> 11:19.069
with Teddy's school.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.550
He spent the morning
pushing kids at recess.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.205
What?!Sweet little Teddy
took it to the streets?

11:24.248 --> 11:26.860
As a mom, I don't condone that.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.601
I didn't tell him
to push other kids.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.865
Do you remember
what I told you?

11:31.908 --> 11:33.997
That this was gonna
blow up in your face?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.172
Let's not
live in the past.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.044
Let's be about the future.

11:37.087 --> 11:40.090
Well, the future is gonna be me
telling you, "I told you so."

11:40.134 --> 11:43.093
I told you so.
Welcome to the future.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.580
Principal Collins,
we are so sorry.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.843
I mean, I-I'm sorry
because he's my kid, and,

11:53.887 --> 11:56.237
well, he's sorry
'cause it's all his fault.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.761
Told you so.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.763
Look, Teddy is a good kid.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.591
He just got
a little carried away.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.159
I don't think we
have to overreact.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.161
Well, due to our zero tolerance
policy on fighting,

12:07.204 --> 12:09.598
I'm placing him in detention
for the rest of the week.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.253
I was just protecting
little kids from bullies.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.168
Well, that changes everything.

12:14.211 --> 12:18.694
We are all against
bullying here, I... I hope.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.827
You're not
pro-bully, are you?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.567
Of course not.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.700
I thought I was just
acting like Batman.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.789
There you go. Huh?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.966
You wouldn't put Batman
in detention, would you?

12:30.010 --> 12:32.273
Another option might be to
give him a little Batsuit

12:32.316 --> 12:35.972
and let him do
his thing.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.714
People think I'm
funny at work.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.064
Okay, that's it.
You are off the job.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.979
It is Mom time now.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.155
Mom time. That's funny.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.766
Oh.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.681
This is not my crowd.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.728
You are in
big trouble, mister.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.904
You can't go around
pushing people.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.559
All right? You use your words,
or you get an adult.

12:57.602 --> 13:00.475
What if that adult is Dad,
and he tells me to shove them?

13:02.477 --> 13:04.261
Don't take me down with you.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.438
We sleep in the same room.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.833
It is never okay, ever.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.835
What if someone's
picking on Emme,

13:12.879 --> 13:15.882
and my words don't work,
and there's no adults around?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.927
Well...

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
Well...

13:24.325 --> 13:26.588
Well, y...

13:30.244 --> 13:32.028
You stumped her, pal.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.945
What a week for you.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.774
I'm not stumped, okay?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.864
I'm just taking a moment
to figure out

13:41.908 --> 13:46.303
how to explain
that obviously...

13:47.304 --> 13:49.916
...the answer is...

13:49.959 --> 13:51.874
something I'm gonna tell
your dad in the other room.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.879
Dad?
Hmm?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.141
Am I still in trouble?

13:58.185 --> 14:00.100
I think things are looking up
for both of us.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.669
Yes, darling?

14:04.713 --> 14:06.671
Look, I-I don't know
what to say to him.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.891
I mean, I don't want anybody
pushing my daughter,

14:08.935 --> 14:11.415
but as a mom, I can't tell him
to push another kid.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.070
Hmm. So you want me
to talk to him?
Yeah.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.072
Because you're the mom.Yeah.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.813
And I'm the...

14:17.857 --> 14:19.597
What am I again?

14:19.641 --> 14:22.774
Rhymes with "glad."

14:22.818 --> 14:24.559
Bonehead?

14:24.602 --> 14:27.040
Going down swinging.
I respect that.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.129
Okay. Fine,
you're the dad,

14:29.172 --> 14:31.218
and there's differences
between moms and dads.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.784
Now I really need you
to handle this!

14:32.828 --> 14:36.963
It feels so good
to be right.

14:37.006 --> 14:40.183
This must be what it
feels like to be you.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.926
All right.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.973
Teddy,

14:47.016 --> 14:49.192
step into the elevator
and let's take a ride up

14:49.236 --> 14:50.977
to the men's department.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.978
Okay?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.588
Here's the deal.

14:53.631 --> 14:54.981
You can't police the world.

14:55.024 --> 14:58.985
Using your words is your first
and best option.

14:59.028 --> 15:04.077
But sometimes...
if your words don't work,

15:04.120 --> 15:07.167
you do what you have to do
to protect your family.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.561
That is the code
that we live by, hmm?

15:10.605 --> 15:12.781
You're making it sound
like the mob.

15:12.824 --> 15:16.045
Yes! Thank you, Andi.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.656
Thank you.
We are like the mob.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.617
Okay? And like the mob,

15:22.660 --> 15:24.749
if you do the crime,

15:24.793 --> 15:26.708
you do the time.

15:26.751 --> 15:29.624
So, it's detention at school,

15:29.667 --> 15:33.933
and I want you to apologize to
those kids from the playground.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.283
Okay.Okay.

15:36.326 --> 15:39.025
So does our mob include
my girlfriend?

15:41.984 --> 15:43.899
You have a girlfriend?

15:45.205 --> 15:47.816
Your first girlfriend?

15:47.859 --> 15:49.426
Since when?

15:49.470 --> 15:52.560
Since today.
Chicks dig Batman.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.486
Head upstairs and draw on
some chest hair, son.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.531
You've earned it.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.014
You're a good boy, Teddy!

16:15.452 --> 16:17.933
That was pretty
good with Teddy.
Mm.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.891
Hey, you did your part, too.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.328
Nah, you're just
saying that.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.112
No, I'm serious.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.723
Moms appeal
to kids' better nature,

16:25.767 --> 16:28.030
and dads teach them
how to defend themselves

16:28.074 --> 16:31.642
when other people
don't have good moms.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.035
I like that.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.906
Yeah, I can get deep.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.823
It's the beer.
Beer makes me deep.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.177
Hey, man.
Hey.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.875
I tried everything, but I can't
get Dad to agree to a nurse.

16:46.918 --> 16:50.139
I'm jeopardizing his health,
disappointing Mom.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.881
I feel terrible.

16:52.924 --> 16:56.493
Oh, Don, I hate
seeing you like this.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.757
Okay, I'll talk to Dad.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.891
Ha! No take-backs!Wha...?

17:02.934 --> 17:04.849
What? You tricked me!

17:04.893 --> 17:07.200
That's right.
It's all on you now. Whoo!

17:10.290 --> 17:13.075
I don't want
to deal with this.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.773
Well, you don't
have to do it.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.906
He said no take-backs.

17:19.168 --> 17:22.215
He got me fair
and square, Andi.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.827
ADAM:
Dad,

17:25.870 --> 17:27.655
we need to have
a serious conversation

17:27.698 --> 17:29.787
about you hiring Funchy.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.920
Can we hurry this up?
I left an old lady

17:31.963 --> 17:33.443
in a wheelchair
by the duck pond,

17:33.487 --> 17:35.271
and she is notgonna
sleep forever.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.057
I hope.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.667
Why are you doing this?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.843
I thought Don was
handling the nurse stuff.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.279
Don handed it off to me.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.585
Which I knew he would.

17:44.628 --> 17:48.110
Oh, this is working out
just like I planned.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.243
Oh, so all that stuff

17:50.286 --> 17:53.072
about him being the favorite
was to trick him.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.638
No, no, that part's true.

17:54.682 --> 17:58.251
I just didn't want to hurt his
feelings by asking you first.

17:58.294 --> 18:01.123
Well, I'm glad we're not
hurting people's feelings.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.473
Hey, look, Dad,
we all know

18:03.517 --> 18:05.258
that this knee surgery
is gonna be tough,

18:05.301 --> 18:06.998
and you're gonna need some help.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.826
Okay, okay, you're always
looking out for me.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.785
I'm just gonna grab a drink
from the kitchen,

18:10.828 --> 18:12.178
and then
we can get started.Mm-hmm.

18:12.221 --> 18:15.572
Uh, uh...
mm, uh...

18:15.616 --> 18:17.183
Damn, I guess
that only works on Donny.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.315
Listen,

18:19.359 --> 18:22.013
you need a nurse,
but nobody can argue with you,

18:22.057 --> 18:24.190
so I'm gonna have to appeal
to your better nature.

18:24.233 --> 18:27.193
That's why I'm calling
in my teammate, Andi.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.282
I knew you would
ask her to do it.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.850
Ah. I pull all the strings
in this family.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.374
JOE:
Nothing she says

18:34.417 --> 18:35.940
is gonna change my mind.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.638
I'm not getting
a damn nurse!

18:37.681 --> 18:41.207
Okay, let's just see how
you do in the hands of a mom.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.340
Joe.

18:46.299 --> 18:50.172
I love you, and I just... just
want you to make me proud.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.348
What are you,
my Little League coach?

18:52.392 --> 18:56.091
I believe you have it
in you to try this,

18:56.135 --> 18:59.399
because, well, you're
the bravest man I know.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.793
That's powerful
because it's true.Yeah.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.883
And you know the real
reason to get a nurse

19:05.927 --> 19:07.668
is to lighten the
load for Bev,

19:07.711 --> 19:10.236
and I know you'd do
anything for your wife.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.413
Fine, I'll have a nurse.

19:13.456 --> 19:17.547
No take-backs.
Ha! We got him.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.201
But I won't be nice to him.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.465
Oh, yay!
I'm so glad I got this job.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.294
Let me tell you,
this isn't gonna be easy.

19:25.338 --> 19:28.993
He's been real touchy since
his pot guy retired to Orlando.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.909
It was medical marijuana.
I only used it for my glaucoma

19:31.953 --> 19:33.998
and your mother's
boring stories.

19:35.391 --> 19:38.873
I, too, am a big
believer in Vitamin Weed.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.962
You should know,
if I'm your nurse,

19:41.005 --> 19:43.399
I won't be able
to pass a drug test.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.228
The good news is,

19:46.272 --> 19:48.187
neither will you.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.450
I like him.

19:50.493 --> 19:53.757
But no taking my
temperature the baby way.

20:03.419 --> 20:04.768
I don't know
what these buttons do,

20:04.812 --> 20:06.596
but I just knocked
your ass out.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.556
Hey, Funchy.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.558
What are you doing here?

20:11.601 --> 20:12.950
He hasn't had
his surgery yet.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.691
I brought over a
little pre-op medicine,

20:14.735 --> 20:17.564
if you know what I mean.

20:17.607 --> 20:20.306
I could smell what you mean
from the sidewalk.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.177
Why'd you call me?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.700
There's a hairball
in my shower drain.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.398
I hear you're good
at fixing that.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.617
Oh, no problem.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.229
Let me just get
a drink first.Yeah.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.582
It's the perfect trick.

20:40.064 --> 20:43.024
