WEBVTT

00:06.250 --> 00:08.125
And at the first blush
of the oak leaves,

00:08.208 --> 00:09.458
we head to the Grove.

00:09.541 --> 00:12.791
The only trouble is there's
a hundred perils between here and there.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.041
I'm peril.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.125
-Stop!

00:24.625 --> 00:27.250
Our light is fading.

00:27.583 --> 00:31.083
And this  mithril...
It is our only salvation?

00:31.458 --> 00:35.250
So the fate of the entire Elven race...

00:35.291 --> 00:37.250
-...is in your hands.
-Hmm.

00:37.416 --> 00:38.416
Nampat!

00:38.500 --> 00:41.291
Sauron was once
your people's enemy as much as mine.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.375
I call on you to reforge the alliance

00:44.458 --> 00:45.958
-between Númenor and Elves.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.625
To save the men of the Southlands.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.416
Give it to me.

00:51.541 --> 00:52.625
It's under here.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.208
All hail to the true
King of the Southlands.

01:00.541 --> 01:02.375
All hail!

01:08.750 --> 01:09.625
Take shelter!

01:09.708 --> 01:10.625
The Queen!

01:11.708 --> 01:13.291
Theo!

04:29.166 --> 04:30.000
Help!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.416
Halbrand!

04:45.250 --> 04:46.541
Elendil!

04:49.208 --> 04:50.625
Halbrand!

04:51.333 --> 04:53.416
Mother? Mother?

04:55.250 --> 04:56.666
Mother!

04:57.416 --> 04:58.666
Over here.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.916
Come here.

05:07.791 --> 05:10.166
-Are you hurt?
-No.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.916
Stay with me.

05:15.125 --> 05:15.958
Come on.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.916
Where's Ontamo?
Ontamo was with me.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.625
Crawl.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.208
Crawl. I won't leave you.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.291
Soldier, over here!

05:49.500 --> 05:50.541
Valandil.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.416
Soldier, he's gone.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.416
He's gone.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
This way!

06:23.208 --> 06:25.083
-He's gone...
-Come on!

06:25.166 --> 06:27.375
-Help! Please, help!
-Soldiers!

06:27.458 --> 06:28.791
Over here! We're inside!

06:28.875 --> 06:30.791
That roof's about to come down.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.500
-Can't get out!
-Quickly, clear a path.

06:53.791 --> 06:56.000
Over here. This way.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.416
Take hold of my hand. You're all right.

06:59.041 --> 07:01.458
Go forward. Stay together.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.583
-Hurry, my Queen.
-Go.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.041
Go towards the bridge.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.541
Get them out of here!

07:13.250 --> 07:15.125
-No!

07:24.500 --> 07:26.208
Isildur!

07:27.166 --> 07:28.041
Isildur!

07:29.500 --> 07:31.833
Old Bolgerbuck went snailing

07:31.916 --> 07:33.708
One autumn day so fine

07:34.291 --> 07:36.500
He found a hundred big ones

07:36.583 --> 07:38.500
I wish that they were mine

07:38.583 --> 07:39.500
Up ahead.

07:39.583 --> 07:42.083
The Grove! I think this is it.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.666
Said that three days ago.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.750
No, no, he's right. I remember this.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.000
Come on.

07:48.083 --> 07:52.041
Do you smell that? Wood smoke!
The others must've started bakin'.

08:21.791 --> 08:23.166
Mr. Burrows.

08:24.625 --> 08:25.875
What happened?

08:26.833 --> 08:32.666
My great-grand used to speak of mountains
to the south that could spit fire-rock.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.166
He said they go to sleep.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.333
Sometimes for hundreds of years.

08:40.125 --> 08:45.958
Only to wake again
when a new evil is rising.

09:07.791 --> 09:09.416
-Hmm.
-Brandyfoot.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.333
Your friend up there. The big fella.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.333
-You don't suppose...
-Suppose what?

09:16.416 --> 09:17.916
Maybe he could fix it.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.833
-Go on, Nori.
-Yes. Like he fixed those wolves.

09:19.916 --> 09:22.541
-Uh, I don't know... I don't know if he...
-What you waitin' for?

09:22.625 --> 09:23.750
He's done so much for us.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.250
It's a mite rude of us to ask more of him.

09:28.708 --> 09:29.791
I see.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.166
-I'll ask him, then.

09:34.666 --> 09:35.500
Sadoc!

09:35.583 --> 09:37.333
Out the way, little ones.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.000
Á keuta...

09:44.333 --> 09:48.750
Á envinyata...

09:51.750 --> 09:53.541
Envinyata...

09:54.291 --> 09:56.125
Lótë na...

09:57.250 --> 09:59.458
-Lótë na...
-What's he mutterin'?

09:59.541 --> 10:02.750
Likely little words,
so the tree'll understand.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.833
Sadoc, trees don't talk.

10:04.916 --> 10:05.958
Some do.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.291
Don't distract him.

10:14.166 --> 10:17.125
Envinyata!

10:17.208 --> 10:18.291
Lótë na!

10:18.375 --> 10:21.875
Great-goats. It's working...

10:23.208 --> 10:29.208
Á kuita! Á kuita! Á kuita!

10:33.708 --> 10:35.125
He's fixin' it.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.125
Just like Sadoc said he would.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.250
-Á kuita!

10:39.333 --> 10:41.250
Dilly, get back!

10:45.000 --> 10:46.916
-No!
-Nori!

10:47.000 --> 10:48.875
My sweet girls! My babies!

10:48.958 --> 10:50.708
Nori! Dilly! Dilly.

10:50.791 --> 10:53.583
Dilly, Nori, are you all right?

10:55.250 --> 10:57.041
-There you go.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.708
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

10:58.791 --> 11:00.708
I'm all right. I said.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.166
-I'm all...

11:23.458 --> 11:26.875
We ask for something sacred
from this mountain.

11:28.666 --> 11:31.166
And so we offer
something sacred in return.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.208
In exchange for access
to your  mithril  mines,

11:36.291 --> 11:38.750
the Elves are prepared
to furnish this city

11:38.833 --> 11:42.291
with game, grain,

11:42.375 --> 11:47.333
and timber from the elder forests
of Eriador for the next five centuries.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.083
Five centuries?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.708
Quite a promise, if they can keep it...

11:52.625 --> 11:54.625
I never made a promise
I didn't.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.500
I see you've learned
a few words of stone-tongue.

12:00.541 --> 12:01.791
Impressive.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.958
Tell me, why should we trust any Elf?

12:08.791 --> 12:10.041
You should not.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.750
But you can trust me.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.333
For I am no common Elf,
but Elrond Half-elven.

12:19.083 --> 12:23.458
And I see in Elves
that which they cannot see in themselves.

12:23.916 --> 12:26.708
That is why I stand
before you now, alone...

12:30.583 --> 12:31.750
Pleading.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.791
For you to save my people.

12:37.500 --> 12:41.750
Please, noble King. Help us.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.750
I will speak to my son now.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
What is to be your answer, Father?

13:27.166 --> 13:32.666
It is said that
when Aulë created our people,

13:33.875 --> 13:35.875
he crafted us of two elements.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.500
Fire and rock.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.041
The rock that lives within us
hungers for the eternal,

13:44.125 --> 13:46.125
resisting the pull of time.

13:47.416 --> 13:51.125
But the fire embraces truth.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.916
That all things must one day
be consumed...

13:57.041 --> 13:59.000
-...and fade away to ash...
-Father...

13:59.083 --> 14:01.416
We do not dig in earth
that cannot support it.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.291
-Delving into depths beyond the darkness.

14:04.375 --> 14:09.166
Tempting shadow, rock, and mine
to bury us all beneath the mountain.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.333
I will not risk Dwarven lives

14:13.583 --> 14:15.541
to help the Elves cheat death.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.208
Cheat death?

14:18.750 --> 14:19.833
Father!

14:23.041 --> 14:26.458
My friend is drowning,

14:27.750 --> 14:30.583
reaching for me to pull him to shore.

14:30.666 --> 14:32.833
You expect me to swat his hand away

14:32.916 --> 14:35.166
because you're afraid
of a bloody rock fall?

14:35.250 --> 14:38.708
The fate of the Elves
was decided many Ages ago.

14:39.541 --> 14:42.166
By minds much wiser,

14:43.083 --> 14:45.375
much farther-seeing than our own.

14:46.916 --> 14:51.916
Defy their will,
and this entire kingdom might fall.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.875
Perhaps the entire Middle-earth.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.166
I am sorry, my son.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.541
But their time has come.

15:16.208 --> 15:19.750
-Lice-bearded, uncaring, old fool!

15:19.833 --> 15:21.041
What if he's right?

15:21.125 --> 15:23.791
You're not thinking
of lettin' this happen!

15:25.000 --> 15:28.041
What choice do we have?

15:28.125 --> 15:32.166
You said the other Dwarf-lords
were open to the proposal.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.833
If we reopen the mine ourselves,

15:34.916 --> 15:37.791
prove to them there's a safe way
to gather  mithril,

15:37.875 --> 15:39.541
perhaps they'd make him listen.

15:39.625 --> 15:42.625
Perhaps we could force your father's hand.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.833
He's more
than just my father, Disa.

15:47.708 --> 15:49.333
He's our king.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.708
What kind of father would I be

15:52.833 --> 15:55.125
if I teach our children the will of a king

15:55.208 --> 15:58.166
should be counted as dross
to be cast to the wind?

16:05.291 --> 16:07.708
-All right, fine.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.833
I shouldn't have said
he had lice in his beard.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.458
-Or called him a fool.
-Yeah.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.625
No.

16:16.833 --> 16:20.041
No, I detest it
when you heap slag on my mother.

16:21.666 --> 16:24.666
Uh, well, in your mother's case,
she actually does have lice in her...

16:24.750 --> 16:26.500
I'm joking. I'm joking.

17:03.750 --> 17:07.000
Don't suppose I can
elbow you into staying for dinner?

17:08.250 --> 17:10.125
Gil-galad must be informed.

17:12.875 --> 17:17.583
And soon, he will no longer be a king,
for there will no longer be a Lindon.

17:24.833 --> 17:26.833
So this is goodbye, then?

17:29.041 --> 17:30.625
We do not say goodbye.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.916
-We say  namá...
-Namárië.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.625
It means more than simply "farewell."

17:47.708 --> 17:51.208
It means... "Go towards goodness."

19:13.875 --> 19:15.083
Elrond!

19:28.583 --> 19:29.791
Why'd they do this?

19:31.541 --> 19:32.958
To make this their home.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.708
Their Shadow Land.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.833
So we take it back, and drive them off.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.250
We have neither position,
nor reinforcement.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.500
These lands are dead.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.625
We must rally to the living.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.583
Or put steel down their throats!

19:49.416 --> 19:51.041
It is over.

19:51.125 --> 19:52.833
Not for me. I won't allow it!

19:52.916 --> 19:54.166
We must!

19:57.666 --> 19:58.916
We must.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.958
What are you so bothered about?
It isn't your fault.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.291
Yes, it is.

20:21.666 --> 20:24.208
Keep moving. That's it.

20:30.916 --> 20:32.791
Help those people at the back there.

21:00.916 --> 21:02.291
Isildur?

21:14.916 --> 21:17.083
-The Queen!
-She's alive.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.083
-Is she hurt?
-Save us!

21:19.166 --> 21:21.125
-Is she hurt?
-Is she all right?

21:21.208 --> 21:22.291
Thank goodness!

21:26.708 --> 21:27.958
My Queen.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.333
Take my horse.

21:46.625 --> 21:48.333
Captain, you...

21:51.291 --> 21:53.416
-Captain...
-Where is he?

21:58.833 --> 22:00.500
Where is my son?

22:03.833 --> 22:06.458
They're dead, aren't they?

22:08.458 --> 22:12.333
Arondir. My friends. My...

22:13.333 --> 22:16.541
My mother. Everyone.

22:17.791 --> 22:22.791
What cannot be known hollows the mind.
Fill it not with guesswork.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.875
Where are we even going?

22:30.958 --> 22:34.333
Númenor set their camp
upon that ridgeline,

22:34.416 --> 22:35.833
beyond that far peak.

22:36.583 --> 22:39.375
That is where they shall hie to,
along with any survivors.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.541
Your mother included.

22:45.666 --> 22:48.916
And be wary.
The Orcs will move in daylight now.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.833
I've killed Orcs before, you know.

22:52.916 --> 22:56.333
When I was your age,
there was no such thing as Orcs.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.541
And now? How many have you killed?

22:59.625 --> 23:01.708
-Many.
-Good.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
I would not use such words.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.583
Why not?

23:07.208 --> 23:10.583
It darkens the heart,
to call dark deeds "good."

23:11.916 --> 23:14.666
It gives place for evil
to thrive inside us.

23:15.875 --> 23:18.458
Every war is fought
both without and within.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.000
Of that, every soldier must be mindful.

23:23.541 --> 23:26.291
Even I. Even you.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.208
Am I a soldier, then?

23:40.083 --> 23:42.208
Perhaps we can make one of you yet.

24:21.916 --> 24:24.666
How much further
until we reach the encampment?

24:26.041 --> 24:27.583
It's just beyond this rise.

24:40.333 --> 24:43.333
How much further
until we're clear of this smoke?

24:46.958 --> 24:47.791
Hold here.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.750
How long have we been clear of it?

25:03.166 --> 25:04.583
Nearly a mile.

25:06.208 --> 25:07.458
I see.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.333
Do you?

25:26.208 --> 25:27.458
Only gray.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.833
Keep walking, both of you.

25:36.916 --> 25:40.083
Guide my horse. No one need notice.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.875
Elendil?

25:46.166 --> 25:48.291
Elendil, please.

25:49.291 --> 25:50.541
Keep walking.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.208
They call it Greenwood the Great.

26:19.291 --> 26:22.791
Keep your head down
and your eye on that line of cliffs.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.958
You'll find the big folk settlements
on the far side.

26:26.791 --> 26:30.708
With any luck, the people there
can help you find your stars.

26:36.708 --> 26:38.458
'Cause all I can tell you is,

26:38.541 --> 26:40.250
Harfoot-folk haven't seen 'em

26:40.333 --> 26:43.291
since the days our ancestors
lived in parts unknown

26:43.375 --> 26:45.416
over a thousand years ago.

26:45.500 --> 26:50.208
And that's a long time to wander.
Even for a fellow with big legs.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.833
Should've just stayed on-trail.

29:12.333 --> 29:16.541
When I saw that star falling,
I should've just let it alone.

29:16.625 --> 29:19.500
-Elanor...
-You tried to tell me, Mother.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.833
But now I understand.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.708
I'm just a Harfoot.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.833
That's all I'll ever be.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.208
Off to bed, Nori.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.916
We can tend to the rest in the mornin'.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.416
Have you ever lost someone close?

30:21.125 --> 30:22.291
To them?

30:24.125 --> 30:25.541
Kin, I mean.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.083
My brother. Finrod.

30:36.416 --> 30:37.750
And my husband.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.666
Husband?

30:41.541 --> 30:44.041
Celeborn was his name.

30:47.041 --> 30:48.875
We met in a glade of flowers.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.750
I was dancing and he saw me there.

30:55.041 --> 30:56.791
You were dancing?

30:57.958 --> 31:00.458
The war seemed so very far away then.

31:04.291 --> 31:06.291
When he went to it, I chided him.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.125
His armor didn't fit properly.

31:10.791 --> 31:12.458
I called him a silver clam.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.875
I never saw him again after that.

31:30.041 --> 31:31.458
My lady.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.166
What you said before...

31:36.666 --> 31:37.875
You're wrong.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.625
It isn't your fault.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.083
It's mine.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.500
You did not intend for this to happen.

31:46.125 --> 31:50.583
I gave power to the enemy.
So that makes me responsible.

31:51.291 --> 31:53.458
Some say that is the way of things.

31:55.791 --> 31:58.666
But I believe the wise
also look upon what is in our hearts.

32:00.708 --> 32:02.291
And this was not in yours.

32:04.958 --> 32:08.541
Do not take the burden of this day
upon your shoulders, Theo.

32:10.791 --> 32:13.541
You may find it difficult
to put it down again.

32:17.250 --> 32:21.083
But how am I to let it go?

32:29.291 --> 32:34.208
There are powers beyond darkness
at work in this world.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.291
Perhaps on days such as this,

32:38.375 --> 32:41.375
we've little choice
but to trust to their designs.

32:42.666 --> 32:44.166
And surrender our own.

32:44.750 --> 32:47.333
My home is gone.

32:50.375 --> 32:52.208
Where's the design in that?

32:58.958 --> 33:00.541
I cannot yet see it.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.541
-Stop.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.666
Shut it.

34:13.916 --> 34:17.041
What is it? What do you smell?

34:17.375 --> 34:18.708
Huh?

34:26.791 --> 34:27.958
Ashes.

34:28.875 --> 34:30.875
Nothin' but ashes.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.458
Come on. We're wasting time.

34:47.541 --> 34:49.416
Rest while you can.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.208
We move at first light.

34:54.375 --> 34:55.791
What light?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.458
Another tremor.

35:29.041 --> 35:31.541
We need to give the rocks
time to resettle.

35:42.666 --> 35:44.916
No.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.541
Self-discipline, master Elf.

35:47.666 --> 35:50.041
Think that'll bring you success?

35:51.625 --> 35:53.125
It did in our contest.

35:54.666 --> 35:56.083
Did it?

36:06.083 --> 36:07.083
No.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.583
You lost on purpose?

36:10.666 --> 36:12.541
My aim was never to defeat you,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.666
but to gain your ear a while longer.

36:16.291 --> 36:18.125
Elf lies.

36:21.916 --> 36:23.541
I was...

36:26.541 --> 36:27.958
Winded.

36:37.875 --> 36:38.958
Blast it.

36:43.666 --> 36:47.166
I always thought you were
a mite Dwarvish for an Elf.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.500
And you are a rather Elvish Dwarf, Durin.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.458
-Son of Durin.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.375
-Grandson of...
-Scoff if you like.

36:59.458 --> 37:03.958
The mightiest thing a Dwarf can do
is to be worthy of the name of his father.

37:10.541 --> 37:12.208
We do have our secret names,

37:13.208 --> 37:15.875
for use only amongst ourselves.

37:15.958 --> 37:19.291
And we reveal them only to family.

37:19.375 --> 37:25.333
Wives, parents, sisters, brothers.

37:33.083 --> 37:35.583
-Elrond...
-Save it, Durin.

37:38.791 --> 37:40.208
For the far side.

37:42.666 --> 37:43.750
Aye.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.500
Durin...

39:10.291 --> 39:12.166
Father...

39:14.541 --> 39:17.166
It's more than we ever imagined.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.666
-King Durin, there is a...
-Enough!

39:22.833 --> 39:27.083
Father, just look at it.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.416
Seize the Elf.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.625
When your mother bore you,

40:30.166 --> 40:33.166
something inside you was ill-formed.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.666
Your breathing was ragged and dry.

40:38.833 --> 40:43.500
A tiny, pitiful sound,
like scraping chalkstones.

40:46.166 --> 40:48.750
Folk said you'd never see
your first winter.

40:51.833 --> 40:53.333
And every night,

40:54.708 --> 40:58.708
after your mother's weeping eyes
had found refuge in sleep,

41:00.375 --> 41:02.375
I held you to the firelight,

41:04.625 --> 41:06.625
kept your chin up all night long.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.833
Seemed to ease the burden a little.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.416
And one night,

41:13.500 --> 41:16.750
I gazed down on your tiny, naked face,

41:18.583 --> 41:20.583
and I saw upon it

41:22.875 --> 41:28.875
the great gray beard
of an old Dwarven-king.

41:30.208 --> 41:34.458
Mighty and terrible
as an army with banners.

41:38.291 --> 41:41.500
And when your mother woke, I told her,

41:43.541 --> 41:46.333
she need cry no more.

41:46.416 --> 41:52.416
Our son would live
and he would move mountains!

41:58.875 --> 42:02.083
How do you expect me
to move mountains, Father,

42:02.166 --> 42:05.500
if you fall to pieces
when I dig a single hole?

42:06.416 --> 42:08.500
You speak of greatness for me,

42:09.333 --> 42:13.208
but you suffocate in me any ambition,

42:13.291 --> 42:15.250
any desire,

42:15.333 --> 42:20.458
any thought
that does not originate in you.

42:20.541 --> 42:23.833
The iron that must bear
the most heavy of burdens

42:23.916 --> 42:27.250
must also endure
the most rigorous tempering!

42:27.333 --> 42:30.958
Consigning your allies to death
is not tempering.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.958
Elrond is as much a brother to me

42:37.041 --> 42:40.583
as if he'd been fired
in my own mother's womb.

42:42.166 --> 42:43.875
How dare you...

42:49.666 --> 42:51.500
How dare you!

42:53.083 --> 42:54.708
Invoke your mother's memory

42:54.791 --> 42:58.416
to defend your decision
to betray your own kind?

42:58.500 --> 43:01.375
No! It's you that's betrayed our kind!

43:01.458 --> 43:05.291
Squandering our future
so you can cling to the past!

43:05.375 --> 43:07.958
You profane the crown you wear!

43:50.208 --> 43:51.083
Leave it.

43:54.958 --> 43:56.625
It's not yours anymore.

44:13.916 --> 44:16.166
And while he was a snailin'

44:16.250 --> 44:18.541
Upon that autumn day

44:18.625 --> 44:22.416
His babe he left a-wailin'
The stream took her away

44:22.500 --> 44:23.958
-Poppy?
-Hmm?

44:24.041 --> 44:25.708
-What are you doin'?

44:25.791 --> 44:27.750
Fetchin' a pail, what's it look like?

44:27.833 --> 44:30.750
No, the vittles. Stop eatin'!
We have to save those.

44:30.833 --> 44:34.625
Why don't you take a look outside,
and then we'll talk.

44:37.291 --> 44:38.125
What...

44:43.625 --> 44:44.875
Look at that! Oh, wow!

44:44.958 --> 44:47.041
We'll go to market
with that crop, won't we?

44:51.458 --> 44:52.541
Here you go.

44:54.625 --> 44:57.750
I don't understand. How?

44:57.833 --> 44:59.083
How do you think?

45:00.708 --> 45:02.125
He fixed it.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.791
Can you believe it, Nori?

45:05.875 --> 45:08.208
There's enough bounty here
to feast tonight

45:08.291 --> 45:11.208
and still have enough left over
to last to Frozen Fish.

45:11.291 --> 45:14.416
Malva's sayin' she gonna make
somethin' called apple-sausage.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
-Applesauce.
-That's what I said.

45:30.125 --> 45:31.458
From Father.

45:31.541 --> 45:33.833
Thank you, Malva.
Where's your sister gone?

45:33.916 --> 45:36.000
We got it.
Is there more space in there? We're done.

45:37.833 --> 45:41.250
...floated down it
So loudly she did wail

45:41.333 --> 45:43.416
The King of the Frog Fishies

45:43.500 --> 45:45.750
Turned her into a snail

45:46.208 --> 45:51.000
Old Bolgerbuck he caught her
So juicy and so sweet

45:51.083 --> 45:55.083
They say his little daughter
He could not help but...

47:41.958 --> 47:43.041
Wait!

47:45.916 --> 47:47.541
You're going the wrong way.

47:49.791 --> 47:51.250
He went that way.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.250
Go on, now.

48:07.916 --> 48:09.125
Nori!

48:12.166 --> 48:14.333
-Leave her alone!
-You heard her.

48:14.416 --> 48:16.333
-Off with you now!
-Begone!

48:17.375 --> 48:20.875
You harm a hair on her foot,
and I'll brain the lot of ya.

49:35.958 --> 49:38.500
Come on. All right.
Keep your hands on.

49:40.208 --> 49:41.041
Together now.

49:45.833 --> 49:46.791
Whoa!

49:49.416 --> 49:50.833
Give him to me.

49:56.041 --> 49:56.875
No!

49:58.125 --> 50:00.541
You're going home. Do you hear me?

50:01.583 --> 50:03.000
You're coming with us.

50:10.500 --> 50:13.333
Please. Berek.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.750
-Please.
-He won't listen to you.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
He won't listen to any of us.

50:57.083 --> 50:59.666
I should never have
pulled the Elf on board.

51:02.458 --> 51:05.125
I should've left her in the sea,
where I found her.

52:47.125 --> 52:48.541
Theo?

53:34.833 --> 53:38.666
The Queen Regent. Is she here?

53:45.916 --> 53:47.916
Preparations are nearly complete.

53:49.041 --> 53:50.875
We can depart within the hour.

53:51.458 --> 53:53.541
What of the Southlanders?

53:53.625 --> 53:57.625
One garrison will remain behind
to escort them to a safe settlement.

53:59.541 --> 54:01.208
And search for our missing.

54:12.333 --> 54:13.333
Galadriel.

54:36.916 --> 54:38.666
No one kneels in Númenor.

54:39.791 --> 54:41.791
You are not in Númenor.

54:42.916 --> 54:44.916
Neither of you are.

54:45.625 --> 54:48.041
A fault that is mine alone.

54:48.583 --> 54:51.166
Our ships are waiting, my Queen.

54:53.958 --> 54:56.291
Let us put this land behind our sails.

55:16.916 --> 55:19.750
Do not spend your pity on me, Elf.

55:21.166 --> 55:24.166
Save it for our enemies.

55:26.041 --> 55:28.458
For they do not know what they have begun.

55:37.125 --> 55:39.875
For I, Míriel,

55:40.916 --> 55:43.541
daughter of Ar-Inziladûn, vow this.

55:44.083 --> 55:45.833
Númenor will return.

55:48.541 --> 55:51.625
Then the Elves will be ready.

55:55.208 --> 55:58.208
Captain, we sail with the tide.

56:01.875 --> 56:03.125
Captain?

56:12.250 --> 56:13.500
I got it.

56:31.166 --> 56:35.166
On your feet now, girl. Stand up.
Help me gather what we can.

56:36.958 --> 56:38.958
Nori, now.

56:39.041 --> 56:42.000
Don't let this splinter your spirit,
it'll be all right.

56:42.083 --> 56:45.833
Don't lie to her, Largo.
She's too old for that now.

56:45.916 --> 56:48.291
I wasn't lyin'. It will be all right.

56:48.375 --> 56:50.166
Pity's sake, Brandyfoot.

56:50.250 --> 56:52.041
Give us a moment to weep.

56:52.125 --> 56:53.416
Weepin'?

56:53.875 --> 56:56.375
Is that all you think we have left in us?

56:56.458 --> 56:57.958
We're Harfoots!

57:09.500 --> 57:11.416
Look, we don't slay dragons.

57:12.958 --> 57:15.041
Not much for diggin' jewels.

57:15.125 --> 57:17.333
But there's one thing we can do,
I warrant,

57:17.416 --> 57:20.375
better than any creature
in all Middle-earth.

57:22.750 --> 57:24.375
We stay true to each other.

57:26.375 --> 57:30.416
No matter how the path winds,
or how steep it gets,

57:32.166 --> 57:33.500
we face it,

57:34.833 --> 57:38.666
with our hearts even bigger than our feet.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.166
And we just keep walkin'.

58:08.875 --> 58:11.375
Nori. Where are you goin'?

58:14.500 --> 58:15.833
To help my friend.

58:16.875 --> 58:19.875
Warn him what's comin'.
He deserves at least that.

58:19.958 --> 58:23.208
Goin' off-trail? Now? Alone?

58:23.291 --> 58:24.541
She won't be alone.

58:28.750 --> 58:31.833
We've left enough folk behind,
we're not leavin' him.

58:34.208 --> 58:36.416
You girls aren't goin' anywhere.

58:37.791 --> 58:39.625
Not without me.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.833
You sure about this, Goldie?

58:45.916 --> 58:49.750
You go into those woods,
you might never come out alive.

58:49.833 --> 58:53.541
They might if a trail-finder
were to go with them.

58:55.375 --> 58:59.375
Brandyfoot girl was right to help him.
Was right all along.

58:59.458 --> 59:02.958
And if you think Malva Meadowgrass
is too proud to admit it,

59:03.041 --> 59:07.041
well, what's the good of livin', Sadoc,
if we aren't livin' good?

59:10.916 --> 59:14.125
You know, Malva, just once...

59:14.208 --> 59:18.458
Once, it would be grand
if you weren't right all the time.

59:20.041 --> 59:22.375
I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.

59:23.291 --> 59:24.458
I'm comin' with ya.

59:28.125 --> 59:30.500
It doesn't matter anyway,
we're all gonna die.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.666
Come on, otherwise we'll be here all day.

59:34.750 --> 59:36.666
Think we'll be able to find him?

59:36.750 --> 59:39.791
He's a bloody giant.
How could we miss him?

1:00:03.708 --> 1:00:05.541
You believe
she'll keep her promise?

1:00:06.375 --> 1:00:07.541
No.

1:00:08.583 --> 1:00:10.000
I'm certain of it.

1:00:11.791 --> 1:00:16.208
Bones have been set,
wounds bound. We can travel.

1:00:16.791 --> 1:00:18.708
Where will you go?

1:00:18.791 --> 1:00:22.083
An old Númenórean colony
by the mouth of the Anduin.

1:00:22.625 --> 1:00:27.541
Pelargir,  they called it.
They say there's fresh land, fresh water.

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:29.875
A fresh start.

1:00:32.750 --> 1:00:34.708
Then I will report
to our High King.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000
To face whatever awaits me.

1:00:40.958 --> 1:00:42.208
But what of our king?

1:00:43.583 --> 1:00:44.833
Your king?

1:00:45.750 --> 1:00:47.166
Has no one informed you?

1:00:47.791 --> 1:00:49.291
Informed me of what?

1:00:56.250 --> 1:00:57.416
Halbrand.

1:01:00.375 --> 1:01:01.958
I thought you had died.

1:01:03.416 --> 1:01:05.500
Better for me if I had done.

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:11.125
Southlanders found him on the road
like this yestereve.

1:01:12.666 --> 1:01:14.666
The wound soured overnight.

1:01:14.750 --> 1:01:17.208
I thought to try and treat him
on the road, but...

1:01:23.875 --> 1:01:25.875
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:28.333
Can he ride?

1:01:28.416 --> 1:01:31.791
I'll have the healers
gather what provisions they can.

1:01:40.625 --> 1:01:42.375
Well, my friend.

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:46.500
It seems fate has in store for us
one more raft.

1:01:46.583 --> 1:01:48.291
This is not over.

1:01:48.375 --> 1:01:51.791
I will not abandon these lands
and condemn them to burn.

1:01:54.083 --> 1:01:55.416
Nor will you.

1:02:22.750 --> 1:02:24.083
Strength to the king!

1:02:24.833 --> 1:02:28.291
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

1:02:28.750 --> 1:02:32.666
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:36.750
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

1:02:48.583 --> 1:02:51.583
Keep it... Soldier.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.166
Commander.

1:03:05.583 --> 1:03:07.208
Strength to the Southlands!

1:03:07.291 --> 1:03:11.041
Strength to the Southlands!
Strength to the Southlands!

1:03:11.125 --> 1:03:13.000
Strength to the Southlands!

1:03:13.083 --> 1:03:15.291
Strength to the Southlands!

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:18.375
Strength to the Southlands!

1:03:35.125 --> 1:03:36.541
I failed him.

1:03:38.958 --> 1:03:41.625
It's all my fault.

1:03:43.708 --> 1:03:44.791
No.

1:03:45.458 --> 1:03:46.750
No, it isn't.

1:03:48.375 --> 1:03:49.875
Whose is it, then?

1:03:53.833 --> 1:03:55.000
It's your father's.

1:03:56.708 --> 1:04:00.708
He's grown too old, too suspicious.

1:04:01.541 --> 1:04:03.958
His mind, too feeble.

1:04:04.583 --> 1:04:07.125
His eyes too dim to see

1:04:07.250 --> 1:04:10.583
that no matter how many crests
he hurls to the floor,

1:04:12.125 --> 1:04:14.791
one day this will be your kingdom.

1:04:17.041 --> 1:04:19.041
Durin IV's.

1:04:19.125 --> 1:04:20.750
Not your brother's.

1:04:22.916 --> 1:04:26.708
Not some other Dwarf-lord's. Yours.

1:04:27.916 --> 1:04:29.250
And mine.

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:35.958
And together, we will rule this mountain
and all others before our time is done.

1:04:39.291 --> 1:04:42.416
That  mithril  belongs to us.

1:04:43.625 --> 1:04:45.458
To you and me.

1:04:46.375 --> 1:04:48.791
And together, one day,

1:04:49.958 --> 1:04:52.208
we are going to dig.

1:05:18.833 --> 1:05:23.375
Seal it up.

1:05:54.041 --> 1:05:55.291
My children.

1:05:56.666 --> 1:05:59.041
Cast off your sun-cloaks and your helms.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.583
You are no longer
to be burdened by the day.

1:06:03.958 --> 1:06:05.541
This is our land now.

1:06:08.791 --> 1:06:10.208
It is our home.

1:06:11.625 --> 1:06:15.333
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

1:06:15.416 --> 1:06:19.166
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:22.458
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

1:06:22.541 --> 1:06:26.000
Hail Adar,
Lord of the Southlands!

1:06:27.166 --> 1:06:28.458
No...

1:06:30.958 --> 1:06:35.583
That is the name of a place
that no longer exists.

1:06:36.541 --> 1:06:39.125
What should we call it instead,
Lord-father?

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:46.375
Adar! Adar!

1:06:47.166 --> 1:06:49.791
Adar! Adar!

1:06:50.541 --> 1:06:53.208
Adar! Adar!

1:06:53.791 --> 1:06:56.500
-Adar! Adar!

1:06:56.958 --> 1:06:58.541
Adar!
