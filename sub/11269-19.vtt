00:01.350 --> 00:04.051
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.821 --> 00:08.289
Oh, Sammy, look who's here.

00:08.357 --> 00:09.591
Harry the Hat.

00:09.658 --> 00:10.798
Aw, man, how many times

00:10.799 --> 00:12.994
am I gonna have to chase
that guy out of here?

00:12.995 --> 00:15.330
Grab your wallets, everybody.

00:15.397 --> 00:17.365
Hello, Harry.
Hey, Sam.

00:17.366 --> 00:19.984
What you doing, trying to
sell some bogus watches,

00:19.985 --> 00:22.587
some knock off's to my customers
and try to cheat 'em?

00:22.588 --> 00:24.122
Sam, that hurts.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.374
This is no knock off.
That's a $5,000 Rolex.

00:26.441 --> 00:28.293
But it's on sale for $2,500.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.929
Is this a real Rolex, Harry?
Yeah.

00:30.996 --> 00:32.797
Whoa.

00:32.865 --> 00:36.668
Hey. Sounds like a
Rolex, doesn't it?

00:36.736 --> 00:38.970
Oh, look at that-
still ticking, too.

00:39.037 --> 00:41.606
Uh, Sam...

00:41.607 --> 00:42.557
Hey, do me a favour.

00:42.558 --> 00:44.025
Just, just take
your bogus goods

00:44.026 --> 00:45.727
and peddle them
someplace else, will ya?

00:45.728 --> 00:48.258
So Harry, are you interested
in buying the watch?

00:48.297 --> 00:52.066
No, but I think my
friend Sam might be.

All right. All right.

02:09.345 --> 02:11.346
But now, the band I'm looking
for is gonna have to be able

02:11.347 --> 02:12.814
to do all
the old Irish standards.

02:12.815 --> 02:15.533
Yeah. "Danny Boy," "Galway Bay,"

02:15.534 --> 02:17.785
"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,"
that kind of thing.

02:17.786 --> 02:19.570
You think you can handle that?

02:19.638 --> 02:21.105
All right then.

02:21.173 --> 02:22.974
Okay, I'll get back to you.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.509
Yeah, adios to you too, Manuel.

02:27.546 --> 02:31.616
Oh, well, I see
you're getting an early jump

02:31.684 --> 02:33.284
on Saint Patrick's Day.

02:33.285 --> 02:34.352
Yeah. That's right.

02:34.353 --> 02:35.786
You know, this time tomorrow

02:35.787 --> 02:37.522
when Gary's still decorating
Olde Towne Tavern,

02:37.523 --> 02:40.024
this place's gonna be open,
people are gonna be flooding in.

02:40.025 --> 02:42.255
That's a good idea, Sam.
You're damned right.

02:42.261 --> 02:45.162
Hey, finally, for the first
time, St. Patrick's Day,

02:45.163 --> 02:46.898
Cheers is gonna do
more business

02:46.899 --> 02:48.332
than Gary's Olde Towne Tavern.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.501
Yes!
Yes!

02:50.502 --> 02:51.970
I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.238
He's beaten you
ten years running.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.689
I know but I've got a feeling.

02:54.706 --> 02:56.707
You know, lucky 11?

02:56.775 --> 02:58.726
We can't lose
this time, Dr. Crane.

02:58.727 --> 03:00.295
We're pulling out
all the stops.

03:00.296 --> 03:02.397
We've got, a two
for one special,

03:02.464 --> 03:05.700
we've got balloons,
we've got a live Irish band,

03:05.767 --> 03:09.603
we've got Mr. Peterson
mixing up some green beer.

03:09.671 --> 03:12.140
Oh, hey, how's that
beer coming, Norm?

03:12.208 --> 03:14.975
You want it fast or
you want it good?

03:15.043 --> 03:17.812
Come on, you've been working
on it for three hours.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.049
And I'm prepared to work on it
all night long, Sam,

03:21.116 --> 03:23.584
because damn it, I care.

03:23.652 --> 03:25.203
Normie, watch this.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.872
(knocking)
Hey, Carla. You-you through in there?

03:27.940 --> 03:29.750
CARLA:
Hold your horses. I'm coming.

03:36.815 --> 03:38.850
Shut up, everybody.

03:38.851 --> 03:39.967
Hey, look, everybody.

03:39.968 --> 03:43.437
It's our little
leprechaun, Brill O'Head.

03:43.505 --> 03:48.042
Keep talking, Clavin, you'll
lose your left Blarney Stone.

03:48.110 --> 03:50.161
This outfit is ridiculous.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.829
I mean, I want to beat Gary

03:51.897 --> 03:55.066
as much as the next guy,
but I'm not wearing this, okay?

03:55.134 --> 03:56.668
I think it kind of looks nice.

03:56.735 --> 03:59.287
Yeah, I think it
looks kind of sexy. That's it.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.124
Please, please.

04:03.191 --> 04:05.877
Hey, everybody,
I've got great news.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.746
I applied to the Boston
League of Businesswomen,

04:07.747 --> 04:09.330
and they might let me join.

04:09.398 --> 04:10.565
Oh, who are they?

04:10.633 --> 04:13.033
Oh, it's this very
prestigious organization

04:13.034 --> 04:15.069
that helps raise the stature
of women in society...

04:15.070 --> 04:17.654
and that kind of crap.

04:17.723 --> 04:19.053
Sam, I need a couple hours

04:19.053 --> 04:21.142
off tomorrow because
they want to interview me.

04:21.142 --> 04:23.344
Honey, it's the
busiest day of my year.

04:23.345 --> 04:24.612
What difference does it make?

04:24.613 --> 04:25.980
She doesn't do anything anyway.

04:25.981 --> 04:28.283
You know what?

04:28.284 --> 04:29.917
Why don't you take
the whole day off?

04:29.918 --> 04:32.987
You're a peach.

04:33.054 --> 04:34.222
Hi, everybody.

04:34.290 --> 04:35.723
(booing)

04:35.791 --> 04:38.843
What the hell do you
want here, Gary?

04:38.844 --> 04:40.928
Well, you know, in the spirit
of Saint Patrick's Day,

04:40.929 --> 04:43.230
I thought I'd come over here and
give you guys a chance

04:43.231 --> 04:44.491
to call off our little bet

04:44.492 --> 04:46.100
and, uh, save yourselves
the supreme humiliation.

04:46.101 --> 04:48.119
I'll tell you what, Gary,

04:48.186 --> 04:50.388
we're gonna win this
lousy bet this year.

04:50.389 --> 04:52.506
Not only that, we're gonna make
ten times more money than you.

04:52.507 --> 04:54.342
And you know why?
Because we've got a strategy.

04:54.343 --> 04:56.928
Well, you know, if you're so
sure of yourself, Malone,

04:56.929 --> 04:58.796
maybe you'd like to raise
the stakes a little bit

04:58.797 --> 05:00.698
and make it more interesting
than the usual 100 bucks?

05:00.699 --> 05:02.366
What you got in mind?

05:02.367 --> 05:04.752
Oh, just a little something
that the loser has to do.

05:04.753 --> 05:06.487
What are you doing?

05:08.723 --> 05:11.325
Oh, I don't know, Gary, uh...

05:11.326 --> 05:14.061
Well, okay well,
if you're going to be chicken about it.

05:14.062 --> 05:16.313
Oh, I'm not being chicken,
because we're gonna win anyway.

05:16.314 --> 05:19.133
So, we've got a deal?

05:19.134 --> 05:20.518
Uh, all right. All right.
Yeah, yeah.

05:20.519 --> 05:23.321
But wait a minute, what is the,
uh, what are the ground rules?

05:23.322 --> 05:25.540
Malone, there's only
one rule, no rules.

05:25.607 --> 05:27.859
Just the way I like it.
Great.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.877
May the best man win.

05:29.945 --> 05:32.447
Sam, may I have
a word with you? Yeah.

05:32.448 --> 05:34.114
I strongly urge you
to reconsider.

05:34.115 --> 05:36.617
Listen, why do you think Gary's
so willing to up the stakes?

05:36.618 --> 05:39.454
I mean, it stands to
reason that he thinks he's going to win.

05:39.455 --> 05:40.488
No, no, he's bluffing.

05:40.489 --> 05:41.809
What makes you think that?

05:41.857 --> 05:44.058
Well he-he's beaten us
ten times in a row.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.728
And not one of those times
has he raised the stakes.

05:46.795 --> 05:49.196
He's running scared.

05:49.264 --> 05:53.267
Well, don't I feel stupid.

05:53.335 --> 05:57.004
All those degrees really don't
do much, do they, Doctor?

06:02.310 --> 06:03.461
Sammy, what's up?

06:03.462 --> 06:05.630
I thought you wanted to get
an early jump on Gary.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.498
Yeah, I did. That's
why I'm here at 9:00.

06:07.499 --> 06:08.549
9:01, Sam.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.168
Some of us were
here at 9:00.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.137
Hey, relax, will you.
It's in the bag.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.922
I fixed it so Gary
can't ever win.

06:14.990 --> 06:16.657
Yeah?
Yeah? What'd you do?

06:16.658 --> 06:18.426
Yeah, you're gonna love this.
You know that-that sign

06:18.427 --> 06:19.727
he's got outside
his window there,

06:19.728 --> 06:21.195
"50 cent beer,
Saint Patrick's Day Special?"

06:21.196 --> 06:23.030
CARLA:
Yeah. Yeah, well I added a zero.

06:23.031 --> 06:25.433
I mean who's going to pay
$5 for a beer, huh?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.268
Good one, Sam.
Yeah.

06:27.336 --> 06:29.270
Sometimes I scare myself.

06:29.338 --> 06:31.072
It's 9:02, Sam. Let's go.

06:31.139 --> 06:33.191
All right. Sorry.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.175
$5 beer.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.244
(laughing)

06:36.311 --> 06:37.778
Yeah, let's see him top that.

06:37.846 --> 06:40.481
(gasps)

06:42.767 --> 06:47.304
See now, that,
that's not right.

06:47.372 --> 06:49.890
Gary did it to us again.

06:49.958 --> 06:53.628
Walled off from the keg.

06:53.695 --> 06:56.397
I want him dead, Sam.

06:56.465 --> 06:57.665
His family, dead.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.467
His friends, dead!

06:59.534 --> 07:02.086
SAM:
Oh, now see, this, this is,

07:02.154 --> 07:04.322
this is the lowest thing
a person can do.

07:04.389 --> 07:05.589
This is pure evil.

07:05.657 --> 07:06.707
Yeah.

07:06.725 --> 07:08.876
Why can't we think like that?

07:08.943 --> 07:10.578
Tell me about it.

07:10.646 --> 07:13.931
I thought you left Woody here to
guard against things like this.

07:13.999 --> 07:16.469
WOODY (voice echoing):
Sorry, Sam. I fell asleep.

07:19.337 --> 07:23.875
They walled Woody in the bar.

07:25.443 --> 07:27.728
Woody, you all right in there?

07:27.796 --> 07:30.664
Well, I'm feeling
light-headed and woozy, Sam.

07:30.732 --> 07:32.450
That's the way I want to feel.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.385
Somebody tear this thing down!

07:38.873 --> 07:42.143
New Armani, new hair.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.813
Am I ready for the Boston League
of Businesswomen or what?

07:45.880 --> 07:49.450
I just have to get my resume
and then I'm on my way.

07:55.607 --> 07:58.109
Is this in any way my fault?

07:58.177 --> 07:59.777
No, sweetheart.

07:59.845 --> 08:02.296
Okay then wish me luck.
Bye-bye.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.352
Yep. Crisis solved.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.004
Where'd you get the beer?

08:10.071 --> 08:13.201
I've got a few squirrelled away
around the bar for emergencies.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.110
I always kind of figured it
would be a nuclear thing,

08:16.111 --> 08:18.178
but I think this qualifies.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.752
Where would you like us
to set up, Mr. Malone?

08:24.820 --> 08:26.320
Oh, hi. fellows.

08:26.388 --> 08:28.556
Uh... uh, yeah, why not?

08:28.557 --> 08:29.990
I'll tell you what,
right over there.

08:29.991 --> 08:31.124
Thank you very much...

08:31.125 --> 08:32.193
Hey, come on, Norm, Carla,

08:32.193 --> 08:33.660
listen we can still win
this thing, right?

08:33.662 --> 08:35.563
We, we've got
the green beer, we've got the band.

08:35.563 --> 08:37.798
All we've got to do is
get rid of this wall somehow

08:37.799 --> 08:39.534
and hustle like
there's no tomorrow.

08:39.534 --> 08:42.703
All we need is, uh, well, a little
winning attitude, right? There you go.

08:42.703 --> 08:44.172
A little positivity.
Hey, fellas,

08:44.173 --> 08:45.973
do me a favour,
play us a little something

08:45.974 --> 08:47.741
to get us in the mood.

10:09.557 --> 10:12.976
Oh. Hold everything.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.178
$150 even.

10:16.898 --> 10:18.549
Hey guys, bad news.

10:18.616 --> 10:20.117
I just came from Gary's.

10:20.185 --> 10:22.386
He's raking in the money,
hand over fist.

10:22.387 --> 10:23.921
And then again why shouldn't he?

10:23.922 --> 10:25.912
I mean, he's charging
five bucks a beer.

10:28.093 --> 10:29.977
Looks like we lost again.

10:29.978 --> 10:32.096
Well, Sammy, guess you're
gonna have to fork over

10:32.097 --> 10:33.764
that 150 to Gary.

10:33.832 --> 10:37.417
Uh, actually, we
raised the stakes, remember fellas?

10:37.418 --> 10:38.770
Oh, yeah, how much
do you have to pay?

10:38.771 --> 10:40.454
Well, it's, it's not money.

10:40.522 --> 10:43.190
It's uh, it's more like
a, a little favour, actually.

10:43.258 --> 10:45.025
Oh yeah? What is it?

10:45.093 --> 10:48.629
It's, it's something
that people do everyday.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.898
Uh, uh, I'm going to,
uh, need, uh,

10:50.966 --> 10:53.100
you three guys
to help me out here.

10:53.168 --> 10:56.236
Hey, just once I'd like
to be included, huh?

10:56.304 --> 10:57.872
All right, Paul, you're in.

10:57.939 --> 11:00.107
Thank you. Thanks,
I owe you Sammy.

11:00.175 --> 11:02.909
Well, what do we have to do?

11:02.977 --> 11:05.696
Uh, it's no big
thing, really, Norm.

11:05.763 --> 11:09.416
We've just got to go over
to Gary's and... (mumbles)

11:09.484 --> 11:10.918
What?

11:10.986 --> 11:12.420
Uh, it's no big deal.

11:12.487 --> 11:15.456
Fellas, all we've got
to do is, is let him (mumbles).

11:17.526 --> 11:20.528
What?
Just get your coats and follow me.

11:20.595 --> 11:22.129
I'll tell you on the way over.

11:22.130 --> 11:23.531
Hey, Sam, what's the big deal.

11:23.532 --> 11:25.700
Why don't you just tell us
what we have to do?

11:25.701 --> 11:26.934
All right, you got to...

11:27.001 --> 11:29.837
(all screaming)

11:39.924 --> 11:42.666
SAM:
Well, what do you think?

11:42.667 --> 11:44.102
NORM:
Well, let's get it over with.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.937
Yeah, yeah, all right, Gary.
Go on. Go on. Go on.

11:45.938 --> 11:49.140
Okay, I want to see
some big smiles.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.976
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:52.044 --> 11:55.679
Gary's Olde Towne Tavern has the
privilege of presenting an act

11:55.748 --> 11:59.016
so humiliating, so embarrassing,
so degrading

11:59.017 --> 12:01.352
that it could only happen
to the men of Cheers!

12:01.353 --> 12:02.787
Let's hear it for them!

12:02.855 --> 12:04.622
(whistles, applause)

12:06.591 --> 12:09.260
Gentlemen?

12:11.997 --> 12:14.031
(cheers and whistling)

12:14.967 --> 12:16.684
Whoo! Whoo!

13:11.406 --> 13:13.173

13:19.313 --> 13:22.750
It was the low point
in my life.

13:22.817 --> 13:27.955
Never ever have I been naked
and not had fun.

13:29.424 --> 13:32.142
I tell you it was degradation.

13:32.210 --> 13:35.012
I thought we were
a lot tighter the second show.

13:37.415 --> 13:40.101
How am I ever gonna show my face
in here again?

13:40.168 --> 13:42.986
Paul, it's not your
face that's burned into my memory.

13:46.374 --> 13:48.876
You know, I kind of found
the whole thing,

13:48.943 --> 13:51.111
uh, quite exhilarating.

13:52.481 --> 13:53.830
Exhilarating?

13:53.898 --> 13:57.768
I meant humiliating.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.537
It was really humiliating.

14:02.073 --> 14:04.241
Uh, guys, you've been really
good to me,

14:04.309 --> 14:05.776
so I'm gonna be good to you.

14:05.843 --> 14:06.910
You need a finish.

14:06.978 --> 14:09.530
Yeah, that's real funny.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.947
That's real funny stuff.

14:10.948 --> 14:12.516
I'll tell you something, man.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.785
I'm gonna get you- I don't
care how long it takes,

14:14.786 --> 14:17.054
how much money it costs,
how many lives are lost,

14:17.055 --> 14:19.523
I'm gonna get you, Gary,
once and for all.

14:19.591 --> 14:20.690
Oh, I hope not

14:20.691 --> 14:22.326
because I'm still shaking
from that terrifying

14:22.327 --> 14:23.494
five-dollar-beer prank.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.763
Yeah, well, I'm still
gonna get you.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.465
Sammy, let's just give it up.

14:28.533 --> 14:29.750
No! Never!

14:29.818 --> 14:31.652
I tell you
I'm gonna get that guy.

14:31.719 --> 14:33.470
I don't give a...
Oh, you know...

14:33.538 --> 14:36.040
Oh, yes,
yes-yes-yes.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.275
There's one guy who can help us
out here, fellows.

14:38.276 --> 14:39.877
I'm calling in Harry the Hat.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.344
(all exclaim)

14:43.514 --> 14:45.982
You know, my underwear's
a little tight.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.952
It's funny, mine's
a little loose.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.454
(both scream)

14:52.730 --> 14:55.509
HARRY:
Let me get this straight.

14:55.510 --> 14:57.944
Over the years, Gary has put
sheep in your office,

14:57.945 --> 15:00.481
had exterminators shut you down,

15:00.482 --> 15:02.083
and then yesterday
he built a brick wall

15:02.084 --> 15:04.685
around the bar
and had you perform naked?

15:04.752 --> 15:07.404
Listen, we need your help bad.

15:07.472 --> 15:09.774
I'm sorry, Sam,
I'm not interested.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.609
Oh, all right, fine.
Fine, Harr.

15:11.676 --> 15:12.726
What is your price?

15:12.744 --> 15:14.374
No, I don't want
your money, Sam.

15:14.379 --> 15:16.647
Besides, if I did,
I could take it.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.966
I kind of like you guys.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.603
So let me give you a piece of
advice: stop trying to top Gary.

15:22.604 --> 15:23.838
You're never gonna beat him.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.273
Face it.
You're a bunch of losers.

15:28.176 --> 15:29.616
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

15:29.617 --> 15:30.794
It's your nature you know?

15:30.795 --> 15:32.263
It's the way God made you.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.480
You're part of his master plan.

15:33.481 --> 15:34.948
If it weren't for you guys,

15:35.016 --> 15:37.417
how would we know
who the winners were?

15:39.221 --> 15:41.422
No, we're not losers.

15:41.489 --> 15:43.179
All right, fine,
have it your way.

15:43.224 --> 15:44.858
Woody, give me a beer, huh?

15:44.977 --> 15:46.360
Sure.

15:46.361 --> 15:48.128
CLIFF: Yeah, but don't
forget to charge him, Woody.

15:48.129 --> 15:49.329
Get some money out of him.

15:49.330 --> 15:50.464
Yeah, all right, all right.

15:50.465 --> 15:51.735
What do I owe you, Woody?

15:51.817 --> 15:53.466
Well, that'll be two dollars.

15:53.467 --> 15:54.869
Hey, you know, I got
a lot of change here.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.738
Will you take all this
and give me a 20?

15:56.739 --> 15:58.522
Well, you know,

15:58.573 --> 15:59.873
be careful of that Woody.

15:59.941 --> 16:00.991
I think he's pulling

16:00.992 --> 16:02.376
his flimflam
short change thing here.

16:02.377 --> 16:03.377
Really?

16:03.378 --> 16:04.545
Yeah, yeah.
Count the money.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.948
Oh... oh, this isn't right.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.166
Aha. Yeah, see?

16:09.233 --> 16:10.501
You gave me too much.

16:10.502 --> 16:11.569
Huh?

16:11.570 --> 16:12.736
That's your tip, Woody.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.955
Oh, no, I'm not falling
for that.

16:15.022 --> 16:17.991
I'll just keep
the two dollars for the beer.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.478
Yeah. See, Harry?

16:20.545 --> 16:22.813
We're not as stupid
as you think we are.

16:22.881 --> 16:23.961
No, I guess you're not.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.883
Here's your wallet, Cliff.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.422
Wow, he's good.
Very good.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.191
Aw, who are we kidding,
you guys?

16:34.258 --> 16:35.759
We might as well just quit.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.979
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
What are you saying?

16:39.046 --> 16:41.047
You mean after
Gary's done to us,

16:41.048 --> 16:42.816
you're just gonna roll over
and die?

16:42.817 --> 16:44.017
You're gonna walk away?

16:44.018 --> 16:45.536
You're gonna be a quitter, Sam?

16:45.537 --> 16:47.621
Yeah, Carla, that's exactly what
I'm gonna do.

16:47.622 --> 16:49.824
I'm gonna quit!
I'm tired of losing to the guy.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.124
Tomorrow I'm gonna go
over there.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.727
I'm gonna make my peace with him
once and for all.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.229
Well, go.

16:55.230 --> 16:57.097
But I'm not lettin' him
off the hook.

16:57.098 --> 16:58.332
This is personal now.

16:58.399 --> 17:00.334
And I don't know what,
I don't know,

17:00.401 --> 17:02.802
but I swear I am gonna do
something to that guy.

17:02.803 --> 17:04.238
Look, Carla,
we're willing to give in.

17:04.239 --> 17:05.571
You should, too.

17:05.573 --> 17:07.608
It's not like you had
to dance naked over there.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.577
No, but I had to look at it
on videotape.

17:10.612 --> 17:14.515
Gary's selling videotapes?

17:14.566 --> 17:17.935
No, He's giving them away
with every five-dollar beer.

17:22.323 --> 17:25.125
Can you believe it?
The League rejected me.

17:25.193 --> 17:26.292
Why?

17:26.361 --> 17:28.531
Because they said I was
too self-involved

17:28.531 --> 17:30.163
and that I wasn't
community-minded enough.

17:30.164 --> 17:32.633
So now I have to spend
the next six months

17:32.701 --> 17:35.769
doing community
service. Yawn.

17:35.887 --> 17:37.754
Woody, get me a charity
on the phone.

17:37.822 --> 17:38.872
Which one?

17:38.889 --> 17:40.490
How the hell do I know?!

17:40.491 --> 17:42.909
Just make sure it's close by.

17:42.910 --> 17:45.596
And I don't want one
that's real depressing.

17:46.964 --> 17:48.665
And no weekends!

17:57.025 --> 17:58.492
(knocking)

18:10.304 --> 18:12.272
(engine starts)

18:19.714 --> 18:21.815
Oh! Oh!

18:25.103 --> 18:26.286
Oh, God! Oh, God!

18:26.354 --> 18:29.589
Oh, God!

18:29.641 --> 18:31.274
Oh, Carla!

18:38.283 --> 18:40.150
(hushed):
Carla!

18:40.151 --> 18:42.803
I just came back from Gary's!

18:42.804 --> 18:44.771
Wha, what were you thinking?!

18:44.839 --> 18:46.373
Are you crazy?!

18:46.374 --> 18:48.275
I really got him good,
didn't I, Sam?

18:48.276 --> 18:49.510
Got him good?

18:49.577 --> 18:51.567
Honey, we're in
serious trouble here!

18:51.613 --> 18:53.847
What are you talking about?

18:53.915 --> 18:55.883
Malone!
You went way too far this time.

18:55.950 --> 18:57.651
You're gonna go to jail
for this!

18:57.669 --> 19:00.337
I swear to God, Gare, we had
nothing to do with this.

19:00.338 --> 19:01.738
Wha-what are you talking about?

19:01.739 --> 19:03.307
Just yesterday, you swore
in front of witnesses that,

19:03.308 --> 19:05.593
that you were gonna ruin me.
You said you'd do anything!

19:05.594 --> 19:07.327
That's true, Sam.
I was there.

19:07.395 --> 19:09.729
What the hell
were you thinking, Malone?

19:09.730 --> 19:11.365
Did you think you were
gonna get away with this?!

19:11.366 --> 19:12.783
Well, forget about it.
I'm gonna call the cops.

19:12.784 --> 19:13.967
The cops?!

19:14.019 --> 19:15.118
Wait a minute!

19:15.119 --> 19:16.753
Putting a rat
in a heating system

19:16.754 --> 19:18.221
isn't even a misdemeanour!

19:18.222 --> 19:21.242
Carla, sweetheart, please,
you're just making things worse.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.076
My, my bar is ruined!

19:23.161 --> 19:25.479
Please, man, don't bring
the cops into this.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.846
Listen, I-I'm begging you.

19:26.847 --> 19:28.348
I'm on my knees here.

19:28.416 --> 19:29.650
No, you're not.

19:32.554 --> 19:33.887
Oh...

19:36.424 --> 19:37.991
Please...

19:38.058 --> 19:40.594
Oh, and this is supposed
to be enough?

19:40.679 --> 19:44.314
Help me out here, will ya?
Come on.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:50.055 --> 19:54.708
Sam! Ha-ha, I gotcha!
That's news.

19:55.493 --> 19:58.045
What's, what's going on here?

19:58.046 --> 19:59.746
You fell for it.
It was a trick.

19:59.814 --> 20:00.948
What is a trick?

20:01.015 --> 20:02.882
I saw your bar being bulldozed!

20:02.901 --> 20:05.168
Somebody bulldozed your bar?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.836
I bulldozed my bar.

20:06.837 --> 20:08.905
You see, I sold my property
to a commercial developer,

20:08.906 --> 20:10.774
and he's going to put a shopping
centre on my old spot.

20:10.775 --> 20:12.376
I'm getting a million bucks
for it.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.643
But the best part is,

20:13.644 --> 20:16.113
you guys have humiliated
yourselves at the feet

20:16.114 --> 20:18.648
of the master one last time.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.534
Yeah, well, the joke's on you.

20:20.601 --> 20:23.436
We happen to need a shopping
centre in this area.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.922
Sam, I hope you don't mind,

20:25.923 --> 20:27.691
but since I don't have
a bar anymore,

20:27.692 --> 20:29.593
I invited the developer
over here to, you know,

20:29.594 --> 20:31.762
help me celebrate.

20:38.510 --> 20:42.689
Sam, I'd like you to
meet your new neighbour,

20:42.690 --> 20:44.458
Rutherford Cunningham.

20:44.459 --> 20:45.993
Real nice place you have here.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.695
Nice to meet you.

20:48.763 --> 20:50.163
Sam, is it?

20:50.282 --> 20:52.032
Yeah.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.867
A bottle of your
finest champagne.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.269
(phone rings)
WOODY: Cheers.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.622
Oh, Gary, uh, phone for you,
the bank.

20:58.623 --> 21:01.441
Oh, yeah. Sam, do you mind
if I take that in your office?

21:01.442 --> 21:03.010
It's big business,
that sort of thing.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.128
Sure.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.615
Bank's not used
to million-dollar deposits.

21:08.683 --> 21:11.635
So, Sam!
It's good to see you again.

21:11.702 --> 21:14.954
Now what's that I heard about
the finest champagne?

21:15.022 --> 21:16.690
Did you do this?

21:16.757 --> 21:19.176
Did you, did you destroy
his bar?

21:19.244 --> 21:21.662
No, I didn't.
Gary did.

21:21.729 --> 21:23.963
He's the one hired
the bulldozer.

21:23.964 --> 21:26.166
Me? I'm just an interested
land developer

21:26.167 --> 21:28.602
who's gonna come up a little
short on funds...

21:28.670 --> 21:33.073
say about a million bucks short.

21:33.140 --> 21:37.043
I have the same problem
with a decimal point.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.813
(Gary screams)

21:39.831 --> 21:40.998
Excuse me.

21:41.065 --> 21:44.034
I believe that's the sound
of my check bouncing.

21:45.302 --> 21:47.470
Mr. Cunningham?

21:47.538 --> 21:51.508
Uh, where's,
uh, Mr. Cunningham?

21:51.559 --> 21:52.943
Uh, he left.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.845
Uh, why, Gary?

21:54.979 --> 21:56.830
Uh, no reason.

21:58.218 --> 22:00.233
Oh, man!

22:00.234 --> 22:02.102
Oh, you are terrific!

22:08.109 --> 22:11.260
If you guys ever need any more
help, you just give me a call.

22:11.328 --> 22:12.929
Oh, thank you, Harry.

22:12.997 --> 22:14.397
Ah, don't mention it.

22:14.465 --> 22:17.333
I guess I've always had
a soft spot for you lunkheads.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.619
Hey, how are we ever
gonna pay you back?

22:19.671 --> 22:23.022
Sam, you already have.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.392
Aw, what a guy, huh?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.627
Wonder what he meant by,

22:26.694 --> 22:28.684
we already have
paid him back, though?

22:28.713 --> 22:29.830
Oh, I don't know.

22:29.831 --> 22:32.599
You know, probably that warm
spirit, the camaraderie,

22:32.600 --> 22:33.967
something like that.

22:34.035 --> 22:36.603
Yeah, yeah, he stole
all my money.
