LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

00:24.030 --> 00:26.010
SEASON VI
EPISODE 25

00:31.210 --> 00:34.200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight!

00:34.220 --> 00:37.120
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:37.140 --> 00:43.080
Let's dive in with a week that was once
again consumed by Stupid Watergate II,

00:43.100 --> 00:45.210
something that features everything
that was bad about the original,

00:45.230 --> 00:48.060
while still somehow
managing to be worse.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.160
It's basically the Diet Mountain Dew
of political scandals.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.160
This week saw Trump
try to shift the narrative

00:54.210 --> 00:56.200
away from the allegations
surrounding him

00:56.220 --> 00:59.030
to conspiracies
surrounding the Biden family,

00:59.050 --> 01:02.070
although in doing so,
he hit some ridiculous roadblocks.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.500
The president is amping up
his accusations on social media.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.340
Tweeting out a video
slamming the Bidens

01:10.360 --> 01:12.400
featuring music
from the rock group "Nickelback"

01:12.420 --> 01:14.320
only to be shut down by Twitter

01:14.340 --> 01:17.390
after the band complained
that was a copyright violation.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.340
It's true.

01:20.360 --> 01:24.420
Twitter removed one of the president's
memes 'cause Nickelback complained.

01:25.390 --> 01:28.350
And that's a sentence
that somehow suggests the news

01:28.370 --> 01:32.380
is being written by an algorithm
designed to generate random shittiness.

01:32.430 --> 01:35.390
"Twitter took down Trump's meme;
And now for the weather,

01:35.410 --> 01:39.330
where it will be raining expired
ranch dressing, rats, and bedbugs,

01:39.350 --> 01:41.380
all in honor
of Guy Fieri's birthday.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.480
Thanks for watching,
I'm Roman Polanksi."

01:44.340 --> 01:48.340
And if that wasn't sufficiently stupid,
the very next day,

01:48.390 --> 01:52.350
during Trump's customary
"screaming next to a helicopter" time,

01:52.370 --> 01:56.380
he decided to answer a question about
what he wanted Ukraine to do like this.

01:57.290 --> 01:59.290
They should investigate the Bidens,

01:59.330 --> 02:03.460
likewise, China should start
an investigation into the Bidens,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.020
because what happened in China

02:06.210 --> 02:12.000
is just about as bad
as what happened with Ukraine.

02:12.190 --> 02:17.000
I would say that President Zelensky,
if it were me,

02:17.060 --> 02:21.040
I would recommend that they start
an investigation into the Bidens.

02:21.220 --> 02:23.150
Holy shit!

02:24.100 --> 02:28.130
Instead of denying that he privately
solicited dirt from a foreign power,

02:28.170 --> 02:29.230
he publicly did it,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.040
and then asked another foreign power
to get involved, too.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.130
Which is just making it worse.
You almost expect his next words to be:

02:37.150 --> 02:41.120
"Biden's not as bad as Jeffrey Epstein,
but no problem, I had him killed.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.060
So sad, great guy.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.070
The killer too-paid the guards,
used a bed sheet, he's outta there.

02:47.090 --> 02:50.030
Wonderful extrajudicial murder."

02:51.060 --> 02:52.090
It is bad enough

02:52.130 --> 02:56.180
that Trump seems fixated on a rightwing
conspiracy theory about the Bidens.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.060
But what makes it far worse
is the extent

02:59.100 --> 03:03.090
to which he's abused the power
of the presidency to pursue that belief.

03:03.110 --> 03:07.210
Text messages emerged,
showing a career diplomat Bill Taylor,

03:07.860 --> 03:10.060
objecting to Trump
withholding aid from Ukraine

03:10.080 --> 03:12.860
unless they investigated
the Bidens.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.050
He apparently texted his concerns
to Gordon Sondland,

03:15.070 --> 03:20.010
Trump's ambassador to the EU, and
the response he got was not reassuring.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.960
Taylor wrote, quote:

03:21.990 --> 03:25.880
"Are we saying that security assistance
and a White House meeting

03:25.900 --> 03:27.940
are conditioned on investigations?"

03:28.060 --> 03:30.850
Sondland responded: "Call me".

03:31.910 --> 03:35.020
"Call me".
That is not a good response.

03:35.970 --> 03:38.930
It would've been less damning
if Sondland had added:

03:38.950 --> 03:40.020
"Because I'm horny."

03:40.930 --> 03:43.950
"And I want you to talk me off.
Even though I'm your boss.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.080
That's the misconduct I'm engaged in
right now. Not anything else."

03:48.960 --> 03:50.050
Eggplant emoji.

03:52.010 --> 03:57.060
And that wasn't the only time
Sondland brushed off Taylor's concerns.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.990
In a text last month he wrote:

04:00.860 --> 04:02.980
"It's crazy to withhold
security assistance

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
for help
with a political campaign."

04:05.880 --> 04:08.080
But Gordon Sondland
disagreed saying:

04:08.890 --> 04:11.820
"I believe you are incorrect
about President Trump's intentions...

04:11.850 --> 04:14.020
No quid pro quo's... of any kind."

04:14.830 --> 04:17.029
He suggested taking
the conversation offline.

04:17.950 --> 04:22.940
He said: "I suggest we stop
the back and forth by text."

04:22.980 --> 04:24.880
When you are that concerned

04:24.910 --> 04:27.920
about not leaving a paper trail
in your conversation,

04:27.950 --> 04:29.940
it's just inherently suspicious.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.860
If you texted someone:

04:31.890 --> 04:35.840
"Have you ever masturbated in the lawn
care aisle at Home Depot?"

04:35.890 --> 04:36.980
and they responded with:

04:37.000 --> 04:39.860
"I suggest we stop
the back and forth by text"

04:39.890 --> 04:42.030
you pretty much
have your answer right there.

04:43.870 --> 04:47.940
A lot of information is tumbling out
into the open thanks to this inquiry,

04:47.980 --> 04:50.030
and none of it is good
for the White House.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.830
It was just confirmed today
that a second whistleblower

04:52.850 --> 04:55.860
with first-hand knowledge
of Trump's Ukraine dealings

04:55.880 --> 04:57.850
spoke to the inspector general.

04:57.870 --> 05:00.980
Other White House staffers
are now voicing broader concerns

05:01.000 --> 05:03.840
about the president's
approach to diplomacy.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.820
"The Washington Post"

05:05.840 --> 05:08.860
chronicles President Trump's
conversations with other world leaders.

05:09.060 --> 05:12.250
Often, they leave his aides
genuinely horrified.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.200
Yeah, it's true.
According to the story,

05:16.230 --> 05:20.180
Trump pestered Shinzo Abe to help
recommend him for a Nobel Prize,

05:20.280 --> 05:23.240
was obsequious and fawning
to Vladimir Putin,

05:24.040 --> 05:25.180
and in a call with Xi Jinping,

05:25.220 --> 05:29.180
repeated numerous times how much
he liked a kind of chocolate cake.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.200
While that last one sounds dumb,

05:31.220 --> 05:35.160
at least "I like chocolate cake"
is a unifying message.

05:35.190 --> 05:40.080
The president might be a racist foghorn
wrapped in old fried chicken skin,

05:40.140 --> 05:44.260
but as far as chocolate cake
is concerned, he is us, and we is him.

05:45.050 --> 05:47.060
Unless you don't like chocolate cake,

05:47.100 --> 05:49.190
in which case feel free
to brick yourself up into a wall.

05:49.230 --> 05:52.230
And look...
You fucking monsters!

05:53.190 --> 05:58.150
While it should be clear
why Trump's Ukraine dealings are bad,

05:58.180 --> 06:02.040
it is worth taking a second
to reflect just how bad.

06:02.140 --> 06:07.110
Using your office to take down your
political rivals is what dictators do.

06:07.250 --> 06:11.230
Trump asking China and Ukraine
to do that should really bother us.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.000
The only question is,
will Republicans care?

06:14.030 --> 06:17.820
And many seem to be trying very hard
to avoid commenting,

06:17.840 --> 06:21.960
maybe because, when Marco Rubio
did comment, it didn't exactly go well.

06:22.870 --> 06:24.960
Do you think it's okay
for President Trump to ask China

06:24.980 --> 06:27.930
to launch an investigation
of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?

06:27.950 --> 06:30.940
I don't know if that's a real request
or him just needling the press,

06:30.960 --> 06:32.950
knowing that you guys were
gonna get outraged by it.

06:32.970 --> 06:36.900
I don't think it's a real request,
I think he did it to gig you guys.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.850
He did it to provoke you to ask me
and others and get outraged by it.

06:41.850 --> 06:45.910
Like I said, he plays it like a violin
and every-falls right into it.

06:46.850 --> 06:51.020
"He plays the media like a violin"
only makes sense if he means:

06:51.800 --> 06:54.820
"Trump plays the media
exactly like he plays the violin,

06:54.840 --> 06:59.860
very loud, very badly, and sometimes
screaming at it for no reason."

07:00.830 --> 07:03.800
But the clear subtext
of Rubio's argument there

07:03.830 --> 07:05.990
is that Trump
is just trolling-he didn't mean it.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.880
But I would not be sure
that that is true.

07:08.900 --> 07:13.960
And even if it is, it doesn't matter.
People act on his jokes.

07:14.470 --> 07:18.590
Russia took his "Help find Hillary's
emails" routine pretty seriously.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.600
And shooting his mouth off
now is significantly worse,

07:21.620 --> 07:24.560
because... you know,
he's the president.

07:24.590 --> 07:28.550
Nixon famously justified his actions
during Watergate by saying:

07:28.570 --> 07:32.500
"When the President does it,
that means that it is not illegal."

07:32.630 --> 07:35.570
But Trump's case here
is actually the exact opposite of that.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.660
Because if he was
just any old Fox News-addled idiot

07:38.680 --> 07:42.560
ranting about how Biden should be
investigated, that would be one thing.

07:42.580 --> 07:46.450
But he's not. He's the president,
he has real power,

07:46.480 --> 07:50.580
and when he abuses it to keep himself
in power, that's a big problem.

07:50.670 --> 07:55.620
It is a case where, when the president
does it, it has to be illegal.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.440
And for good reason.
Because unfortunately,

07:58.460 --> 08:02.500
not every foreign government will be as
brave and willing to stand up to Trump

08:02.520 --> 08:04.470
as fucking Nickelback.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.440
And now this!

08:08.540 --> 08:13.440
British News Programs
Seem Unable To Book The Right Guest.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.590
May I speak to Gareth Thomas,
the shadow minister for Civil Society.

08:17.070 --> 08:20.040
He's in our central London studio.
Sir, good news, this?

08:20.060 --> 08:24.120
I'm not Gareth Thomas, I'm Richard
Dodd from the British Retail Consortium.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.120
We're joined now by Steven Joseph.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.230
He's chief executive
of the Campaign for Better Transport.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.260
- A very good morning to you.
- Unfortunately I'm Steve McKenzie.

08:34.059 --> 08:38.070
- I'm the finance expert this morning.
- It's equally as good to have you on.

08:38.120 --> 08:42.200
Joining us is Sara Adelbi,
a human rights barrister.

08:43.059 --> 08:46.060
Hi, I'm Addi Kakabara,
from Amnesty International.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.260
We have the wrong guest up.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.080
Joining us from our New York studio
is Ben Walker

08:50.120 --> 08:52.130
who's the baseball editor
for the Associated Press.

08:52.160 --> 08:58.050
I know that you've been covering Roger
Clemens' career for the last 23 years.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.050
Remind us how big a name he is
in the sport of baseball.

09:01.150 --> 09:03.220
Ben, can you hear me in New York?
It's Francis in London.

09:04.280 --> 09:09.170
It's even a worse situation than that.
Because I am not Ben Walker.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.280
And I know nothing about baseball.

09:12.070 --> 09:15.250
He's now attempting to scale
the world's highest mountain again.

09:16.070 --> 09:19.060
He joins us now in the studio
ahead of his next mission.

09:19.310 --> 09:22.230
- Good morning.
- I think you have the wrong guest.

09:27.340 --> 09:32.340
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns China, the country that is,

09:32.360 --> 09:35.350
not the thing you fill a cabinet with
when you've run out of human needs.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.330
And I know there is a lot
going on with China right now,

09:40.120 --> 09:43.330
from the ongoing pro-democracy
protests in Hong Kong to the trade war

09:43.350 --> 09:47.230
that's been good and easy to win
for the last year and a half now.

09:47.260 --> 09:50.310
But China took a moment
to celebrate the 70th anniversary

09:50.330 --> 09:54.290
of the Communist Party coming to power
and they did it in some style.

09:55.350 --> 09:58.360
Chinese President Xi Jinping
and other senior officials

09:59.130 --> 10:02.260
watched a grand evening gala
Tuesday on Tiananmen Square.

10:03.210 --> 10:05.360
A song called
"I Love You China" played.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.230
And the number 70
was formed in the night sky.

10:10.230 --> 10:12.300
They didn't just make a 70
out of fireworks,

10:12.330 --> 10:16.240
people also made a 70
out of chickens and out of pandas.

10:16.290 --> 10:22.160
That is a 7 made out of pandas,
with a zero made out of apples.

10:22.340 --> 10:26.300
And if there aren't enough pandas
to make a whole 70 out of pandas,

10:26.320 --> 10:29.340
maybe pandas don't deserve
to be made into a 70.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.420
You might not like it when I imply
pandas are shitty and worthless,

10:33.440 --> 10:35.290
but you know
who agrees with me on that?

10:35.310 --> 10:38.350
Other pandas.
Pandas look at pandas and say:

10:38.370 --> 10:41.380
"That thing sucks so much,
I would not fuck it

10:41.400 --> 10:45.510
if the survival of my species depended
on it, which it absolutely does."

10:46.460 --> 10:48.390
But look, that's not the point.

10:48.510 --> 10:53.500
The point is, since China's government
is celebrating its last 70 years,

10:54.280 --> 10:56.290
we thought we'd help
by highlighting

10:56.310 --> 11:00.350
one the most massively consequential
policies they undertook in that time:

11:00.370 --> 11:01.470
the one child-policy.

11:01.490 --> 11:05.500
It began in 1980, and it was basically
exactly what it sounded like:

11:05.520 --> 11:10.320
a policy from the government limiting
how many children families could have.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.340
And I know
it might seem like old news,

11:12.370 --> 11:16.320
but this policy actually ended
far more recently than you might think.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.480
În China, the Communist Party

11:18.510 --> 11:23.500
is ending the one child policy
as a method of population control.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.370
That was 2015,

11:27.250 --> 11:31.260
meaning China made the historic
decision to end its one child policy

11:31.280 --> 11:34.230
the same year Pizza Rat
made the historic decision

11:34.250 --> 11:37.320
to carry pizza down stairs
while being a rat.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.230
Which one of those decisions
will prove to be more historic?

11:41.270 --> 11:44.230
We won't know until future generations
are reading about both events

11:44.260 --> 11:50.170
in the history textbook: "History Is
Memes: 435 Pages About Pizza Rat."

11:50.330 --> 11:53.320
So, why talk about
something that's now over?

11:53.350 --> 11:57.210
The history of the one child policy
reveals a lot

11:57.230 --> 12:01.180
about how the Communist Party
has used and held on to its power.

12:01.210 --> 12:04.390
And for another,
the effects of it are far from over.

12:05.170 --> 12:09.360
The one child policy is behind a lot
of challenges facing China right now.

12:10.250 --> 12:14.200
To take just one major example:
for reasons we'll discuss later,

12:14.230 --> 12:20.190
there are currently around 34 million
more males than females in China.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.350
That is a lot.

12:22.180 --> 12:25.400
In some villages, the ratio of men
to women can be nearly two to one.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.150
A situation that's made journalists
who've visited noticeably sad.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.340
Welcome to the most miserable
place in China for lovers.

12:34.260 --> 12:38.280
Here where single men sit around
all day, it seems, with nothing to do.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.340
You come across them everywhere,
listless and hopeless.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.190
That is so harsh!

12:47.180 --> 12:50.170
"The most miserable place in China
for lovers."

12:50.240 --> 12:53.350
I presume narrowly beating out
wherever they keep the pandas.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.250
The one on the right
is clearly thinking:

12:56.270 --> 13:00.350
"I am not doing it." And the one on
the left is completely fine with that.

13:01.340 --> 13:05.220
So, tonight, let's talk
about China's one child policy:

13:05.240 --> 13:09.300
why it happened, how it was carried out
and what the consequences have been.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.330
And let's start with why it happened.

13:11.350 --> 13:15.270
In the 60s and 70s, overpopulation
was a huge global concern,

13:15.300 --> 13:18.240
with alarmists
making apocalyptic predictions.

13:18.260 --> 13:22.280
Even Disney got in on it, producing
this video for the Population Council.

13:23.180 --> 13:27.350
Suppose that in time,
more and more children are born.

13:28.190 --> 13:32.190
The children will be sickly, unhappy,
with little hope for the future.

13:32.250 --> 13:35.230
This picture can be true
for countless families

13:36.080 --> 13:38.270
if the number of children
born is left to chance.

13:39.220 --> 13:42.210
But fortunately,
this need not happen anymore.

13:43.060 --> 13:45.090
Modern science has given us a key

13:45.230 --> 13:49.060
that makes possible
a new kind of personal freedom:

13:49.210 --> 13:50.230
family planning.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.260
Family planning?
Never heard of it.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.230
Okay, okay, so first:

13:59.070 --> 14:02.060
I know that clip
seems a little racially problematic,

14:02.080 --> 14:05.240
but let's remember Disney also made
"Song of the South",

14:05.270 --> 14:08.180
so we're grading them
on a very steep curve here.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.130
But secondly,
and I cannot stress this enough,

14:11.150 --> 14:15.240
I don't care how useful the information
Donald has on family planning might be,

14:15.260 --> 14:18.190
you never take advice
on having sex from a duck.

14:18.280 --> 14:23.250
They have corkscrew-shaped penises
that they regrow every mating season.

14:23.270 --> 14:26.040
Donald Duck
actually looks like this.

14:26.160 --> 14:30.130
And I'm simply not taking
family planning lessons

14:30.530 --> 14:32.590
from some corkscrew-dicked pervert.

14:34.430 --> 14:40.500
In any case, curly-dick duck aside,
the overpopulation hysteria was global.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.400
And China was no exception.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.430
And the Communist Party also saw
controlling their population growth

14:45.460 --> 14:49.530
as key to raising the China's economic
prospects and standard of living,

14:49.550 --> 14:51.610
making it easier for them
to hold onto power.

14:51.630 --> 14:54.550
So, who did they pick
to solve this issue?

14:54.570 --> 14:58.550
Take a minute and think about
who would be the absolute worst choice

14:58.580 --> 15:01.540
to craft a prescriptive
nationwide policy on reproduction

15:01.560 --> 15:04.550
and, do keep in mind,
Jared Kushner is not Chinese.

15:05.510 --> 15:07.620
I'll give you the answer,
it was actually the military.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.620
The policy was crafted
by military scientists.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.570
Which, as one expert will tell you,
was not ideal.

15:14.470 --> 15:15.570
It was conceived by men.

15:16.630 --> 15:20.590
So, and the, these men
were primarily missile scientists,

15:20.610 --> 15:24.430
who envision women
as in some ways like machines.

15:24.530 --> 15:27.590
What these men thought
were that, women's fertility,

15:27.620 --> 15:30.480
you can push it up
or push it down like a switch.

15:30.770 --> 15:33.770
They didn't understand
that that's not how things work.

15:33.890 --> 15:37.960
She's absolutely right.
Family planning isn't rocket science.

15:38.740 --> 15:41.810
That's exactly why rocket scientists
should not do it.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.730
It's the same reason
we don't let OB-GYNs

15:44.760 --> 15:47.720
launch babies into space
and land them on the moon.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.880
Experts should stay in their lane.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.950
This policy
was a nationwide directive,

15:53.750 --> 15:55.900
in the form of an open letter
to members of the Communist Party,

15:55.930 --> 15:58.880
but it was actually
implemented at the lower level,

15:58.920 --> 16:02.820
meaning enforcement varied wildly
depending on where you lived.

16:02.840 --> 16:03.910
There could be exceptions.

16:03.930 --> 16:08.900
Many rural areas even allowed families
a second child if their first was a girl.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.870
But, the general message
was to have just one child.

16:12.950 --> 16:16.830
It was often expressed through
striking propaganda, like this!

16:16.960 --> 16:22.960
If you have a second child,
you violate the law.

16:23.780 --> 16:25.860
Then you'll be detained.

16:25.890 --> 16:28.870
If you try to escape,
you will end up in jail.

16:28.890 --> 16:30.800
Think twice about it.

16:32.240 --> 16:36.110
Don't say I didn't warn you.

16:36.230 --> 16:41.040
Holy fuck!
That is undeniably effective.

16:41.200 --> 16:45.040
No better way to dissuade parents
from having more children

16:45.060 --> 16:47.180
than by showing them
that particular child.

16:48.060 --> 16:52.090
"Congratulations, Mrs. Jong, you've
given birth to a real aggro narc!"

16:53.160 --> 16:57.210
There were also propaganda signs,
saying things like:

16:57.230 --> 17:01.210
"Respond actively to the call that
each couple should have one child."

17:01.260 --> 17:04.260
And "Have fewer children
but raise the quality."

17:05.079 --> 17:07.250
Which is just
not how children work.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.190
Children, and I say this
as a loving parent,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.240
are not high-quality individuals.

17:13.150 --> 17:16.240
Their artwork is derivative
and their stories, meandering.

17:16.260 --> 17:20.140
No one who's ever been asked:
"Who's your ideal dinner guest"

17:20.170 --> 17:24.060
has said, "Someone who insists
their food be dinosaur-shaped."

17:24.220 --> 17:29.180
Broadly, the one child policy was also
enforced by an enormous bureaucracy.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.110
At the national level, there were
half a million employees

17:33.340 --> 17:36.400
in charge of administering it,
with many millions more

17:36.430 --> 17:40.320
at the local level and their
scrutiny could be intense.

17:40.510 --> 17:44.370
Workers must have their factory's
permission to get married.

17:44.390 --> 17:48.390
Each team of 16 women,
has its birth planning worker.

17:48.490 --> 17:51.550
She is constantly alert for
anyone who might be pregnant

17:52.330 --> 17:53.560
or even thinking
of having a child.

17:54.330 --> 17:57.460
We asked: "Doesn't the fact that
she's watching her workmates,"

17:57.480 --> 18:00.370
"asking them
about their periods and so on,"

18:00.400 --> 18:02.410
"doesn't that make
for resentment?"

18:03.350 --> 18:05.450
No, the workers
are grateful for my concern.

18:06.340 --> 18:08.540
Really?
Are you sure about that?

18:08.560 --> 18:11.400
The workers are grateful
for your concern?

18:11.420 --> 18:15.360
If there is anything I know about
women, and there definitely isn't,

18:15.380 --> 18:19.380
it's that they love to be asked
about their periods at work.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.360
Seriously. Just go up to a colleague
and say:

18:22.380 --> 18:24.480
"How do you like
that DivaCup, girlfriend?"

18:24.500 --> 18:27.460
"You wear it with a period
thong to prevent leakage?"

18:27.480 --> 18:30.500
"How about that extra-absorbent
period toilet paper?"

18:30.520 --> 18:34.450
My female writers told me that one
of those things I said isn't real,

18:34.860 --> 18:36.850
but they refuse
to tell me which one.

18:37.010 --> 18:41.020
If I'm honest, my money
is on "DivaCup"

18:41.040 --> 18:45.060
'cause it sounds like what Mariah Carey
demands all her beverages come in.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.910
I could be wrong, but obviously,
the enforcement went much further.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.040
Local officials
would issue massive fines

18:52.060 --> 18:54.980
for having more children
than you were allowed,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.980
fines that routinely were multiple
times a household's annual income.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.910
Many villages came to depend
upon those fines for revenue.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.930
Even if parents could afford them,

19:04.960 --> 19:08.080
some chose never to let
their kids ever forget it.

19:09.010 --> 19:11.850
One child policy fines
are now so common

19:11.890 --> 19:14.930
that they're being
incorporated into children's names.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.890
Why did we name our child
"20000 Chen?"

19:17.910 --> 19:20.980
That's how much we were fined
to have him, 20000 yuan.

19:21.950 --> 19:25.900
Yeah. They named
their kid "20000 Chen"

19:25.950 --> 19:29.040
so everyone would know what
they had to go through to have him.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.890
It's the equivalent of

19:30.910 --> 19:35.860
"Jason Last-Minute-Epidural-And-A-Lot
- Of-Shitting-On-The-Table Rabinowitz."

19:35.940 --> 19:38.000
It's a lot
to make that kid carry around.

19:38.150 --> 19:41.970
Massive fines were far
from the worst-case scenario,

19:41.990 --> 19:43.930
particularly for girls.

19:43.990 --> 19:47.060
In China, there's
a strong preference for boys,

19:47.090 --> 19:51.130
which are seen as
an economic investment for old age,

19:51.160 --> 19:54.060
as sons are expected
to support their parents.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.090
Families would go to great lengths

19:56.120 --> 19:59.060
to make sure that
their one child was a boy:

19:59.130 --> 20:02.990
from abandoning girls,
to having sex-selective abortions,

20:03.040 --> 20:05.080
to cases of female infanticide.

20:05.160 --> 20:09.100
In some areas, the government's
methods of preventing more births,

20:09.120 --> 20:11.130
regardless of gender,
were brutal.

20:11.970 --> 20:14.110
Children could be taken
and sold to orphanages

20:14.130 --> 20:18.130
and there were millions of forced
sterilizations and forced abortions.

20:18.930 --> 20:21.150
This woman is still haunted
by the fact she was forced

20:21.930 --> 20:23.980
to abort her child at nine months,

20:24.030 --> 20:27.130
because her husband had a child
from a previous marriage.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.130
It's like an arrow through my heart.
They made a mistake,

20:31.160 --> 20:34.980
I should have had my baby,
they did not let me to keep my child.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.140
The policy was
just so senseless.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.980
That's obviously horrifying.
I know that there are some

20:45.000 --> 20:49.050
who like to hold up China as a blanket
argument against abortion.

20:49.080 --> 20:56.030
It is very easy to be both pro-choice
and anti-forced abortion,

20:56.080 --> 21:00.100
in the same way you can be pro-drinking
fountain and anti-waterboarding.

21:00.160 --> 21:04.110
The important thing is who's
in control of the fucking process.

21:05.080 --> 21:09.980
As you have seen so far,
many heartbreaking decisions

21:10.000 --> 21:13.080
were forced on Chinese families
by the one child policy.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.140
You'll be relieved to hear

21:15.160 --> 21:18.950
that we're gonna jump now
from the past to the present.

21:19.010 --> 21:22.100
There are enormous ongoing
ramifications to China's policy

21:22.120 --> 21:24.120
and much
like Donald Duck's penis,

21:24.150 --> 21:28.080
there are a lot of twists and turns
and an important point at the end.

21:28.920 --> 21:32.990
For a government that made it a point
to micromanage their citizens' lives,

21:33.010 --> 21:37.150
China did little to prepare for
the long-term consequences.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.910
And let's start
relatively small here.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.920
The one child policy meant
that an entire generation

21:42.940 --> 21:44.970
is filled with many only children.

21:45.030 --> 21:49.840
Some theorize that means lots of kids
whose parents have overindulged them,

21:49.870 --> 21:53.920
as a newscast explained in the '90s
in a not very tactful way.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.880
A surprising by-product of China's
affluence is a young generation

21:58.910 --> 22:00.940
with growing numbers
of fat children,

22:01.900 --> 22:06.860
"little emperors" or "little meatballs"
as they're called in Chinese.

22:07.070 --> 22:12.060
Calling that kid a little meatball
is both mean and adorable.

22:12.840 --> 22:17.070
You shouldn't call a child a meatball
if he doesn't want to.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.870
But on the other hand:
look at that little meatball!

22:20.990 --> 22:25.040
Look at his little meatball hat. I want
to bite that little meatball's tummy.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.920
I want to say "nom nom"

22:26.980 --> 22:28.960
and throw him up
in the air and say:

22:28.980 --> 22:30.980
"Who's a little meatball?
You are!"

22:31.000 --> 22:33.970
That's the proper
reaction to that little meatball.

22:33.990 --> 22:37.070
Hashtag #MeatballHero,
hashtag #ThatsASpicyMeatABall.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.040
The policy didn't just produce
lots of scrumptious little meatballs.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.900
Remember those fines
that resulted in 20000 Chen?

22:46.980 --> 22:50.010
There were many parents who
did not have that kind of money.

22:50.030 --> 22:53.970
But even if, for whatever reason,
they were able to keep their child,

22:53.990 --> 22:56.850
there was a massive catch,
as this woman,

22:56.880 --> 23:00.030
born 26 years ago as a second
child, can attest.

23:00.990 --> 23:04.010
Officials told her parents
they would have to pay a fine,

23:04.030 --> 23:07.030
the equivalent to about
four years of their salaries.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.000
They could never afford it,

23:09.030 --> 23:12.050
so she was never registered
as a Chinese citizen.

23:13.960 --> 23:18.070
Her birth certificate
has a blank instead of her name.

23:18.940 --> 23:22.000
Without an ID card,
I can't have a normal life.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.970
I could never go to school,
never see a doctor.

23:25.030 --> 23:29.860
I can't work and I can't get married.
It makes me very sad.

23:30.070 --> 23:33.930
Exactly. She can't go to the doctor,
find a job, or get married.

23:33.950 --> 23:37.890
She's a ghost without all the fun
parts of being a ghost,

23:38.070 --> 23:40.260
like rattling chains,
or summoning cold winds,

23:40.280 --> 23:44.140
or making terrible ceramics
while having sex with Demi Moore.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.190
That woman is far from alone.

23:47.210 --> 23:53.210
At least six and a half million Chinese
have no official status

23:53.240 --> 23:57.050
because they were born
outside the family planning rules.

23:57.100 --> 24:01.060
But one of the largest and perhaps
most far reaching effects of a policy

24:01.080 --> 24:04.090
that resulted in the elimination
of millions of girls,

24:04.110 --> 24:07.110
is that a couple of decades later
you have a generation

24:07.130 --> 24:10.200
with a massive gender disparity
and far more men than women,

24:10.220 --> 24:13.130
34 million more,
you may remember.

24:13.230 --> 24:18.110
Millions of Chinese men will end up
without female mates.

24:18.130 --> 24:21.170
Which has created a number
of odd business opportunities

24:21.190 --> 24:23.240
to give men an edge
in attracting women.

24:23.270 --> 24:28.150
This is an agency catering for
China's growing population of singles.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.220
Choosing the right clothes,
the right chat lines on the first date

24:32.250 --> 24:34.110
are all part of the plan.

24:34.220 --> 24:36.250
For singles like Lo Gu Zhang,

24:37.050 --> 24:39.180
newfound magic skills
may do the trick.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.770
"You can really impress a girl,"
he says,

24:41.790 --> 24:45.600
"and they'll become
attracted without even knowing it."

24:46.720 --> 24:49.840
I know this might seem
hard to believe,

24:50.630 --> 24:53.660
but that's actually a pretty
amazing magic trick there.

24:53.690 --> 24:56.690
At the beginning, the hoop
and the chain are separate.

24:56.720 --> 25:00.600
By the end, any woman he's talking
to has disappeared.

25:01.730 --> 25:07.670
No matter how many cool tricks
they learn,

25:07.690 --> 25:11.680
millions of men who want
a wife will never have one.

25:11.700 --> 25:14.670
Which has led to a bunch
of unintended consequences,

25:14.690 --> 25:16.770
including the success
of this company.

25:20.740 --> 25:24.650
There are far too many men in China
compared to the number of women.

25:24.670 --> 25:26.670
It's a great business opportunity.

25:26.690 --> 25:29.840
There are more single men who cannot
find a wife and are desperate.

25:30.610 --> 25:33.620
We've decided to make
life-sized dolls for them.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.790
These men are happy to pay the price,
because the alternative

25:36.810 --> 25:39.700
is to be alone
for the rest of their lives.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.200
Buying a life-sized sex doll does not
stop you from being alone.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.220
It makes you somehow more alone

25:50.000 --> 25:52.080
than you were
when you were totally alone.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.090
If one is the loneliest number,

25:54.110 --> 25:58.030
one and a sex doll is the even
loneliester number.

25:59.010 --> 26:02.110
While buying a sex doll
to replace the wife you'll never have

26:02.140 --> 26:07.030
may seem like rock-bottom,
it's somewhere around rock-middle.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.210
The gender imbalance created
by the one child policy

26:10.240 --> 26:13.180
has created
a huge market for human trafficking,

26:13.200 --> 26:17.240
with women and girls trafficked from
within China or surrounding countries

26:18.010 --> 26:20.010
to be sold as wives
for Chinese men.

26:20.070 --> 26:23.210
One study estimated that,
in just a four-year period,

26:23.240 --> 26:28.110
21000 women and girls,
just from northern Myanmar,

26:28.130 --> 26:31.240
were forced into marriage
in one Chinese province alone.

26:32.110 --> 26:36.160
It isn't fair to expect the rocket
scientists who designed this policy

26:36.180 --> 26:41.050
to anticipate the boom times it would
create for sex dolls and trafficking.

26:41.260 --> 26:45.230
The irony is that one of the key
justifications for the policy

26:45.250 --> 26:48.320
was that it would boost
China's future economic prospects.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.250
Those prospects are under threat,
thanks to that very policy.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.410
China's population is rapidly aging

26:55.200 --> 26:58.410
and the youngest generation
is facing crushing responsibilities.

26:59.300 --> 27:04.410
Researchers estimate that by 2025,
one in five Chinese in urban areas

27:04.430 --> 27:08.320
will be over 60
and that by 2050,

27:08.370 --> 27:12.260
that age group will increase
to 30 percent of the population.

27:13.320 --> 27:17.290
The policy has led to what
is called the 4-2-1 problem,

27:17.330 --> 27:22.290
where one child will be responsible
for two parents and four grandparents.

27:23.230 --> 27:25.430
Right, that's a lot
for someone to take on.

27:26.210 --> 27:29.200
If you've seen "Willy Wonka
&amp; The Chocolate Factory",

27:29.220 --> 27:31.440
you know the pressure
of having four grandparents,

27:32.210 --> 27:33.270
all relying on you.

27:33.290 --> 27:37.240
Best-case scenario, you win a
chocolate contest and you end up

27:37.260 --> 27:40.430
impressing a slave-owner by surviving
his child murder factory.

27:41.250 --> 27:44.290
But that's only gonna happen
to what? 12-14 of them, tops.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.380
The rest are facing
a big challenge here.

27:46.410 --> 27:51.270
There are worrying signs for China.
From 2012 to 2017,

27:51.290 --> 27:56.260
the country's working-age population
decreased by 25 million people,

27:56.300 --> 27:59.340
the equivalent
of the entire population of Australia

27:59.370 --> 28:01.360
disappearing from the workforce.

28:01.380 --> 28:05.290
And not for the reasons Australians
usually leave the workforce,

28:05.310 --> 28:07.350
like being carried off
by a giant snake.

28:07.430 --> 28:10.370
Australia is a terrible island
full of monsters.

28:10.390 --> 28:14.290
Those aren't even stars on their
flag. They're spiders.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.230
Get out of here!
You're disgusting.

28:18.300 --> 28:22.330
And the troubling economic forecast
is a big reason why China's government

28:22.350 --> 28:24.380
decided to end
their one child policy.

28:24.410 --> 28:26.420
If you think:
"Great, happy ending."

28:27.200 --> 28:31.260
"The government learned its lesson
and stopped meddling with family size",

28:31.280 --> 28:32.320
not exactly.

28:32.340 --> 28:36.240
Remember that clip earlier announcing
that the policy was over?

28:36.300 --> 28:38.280
Let me play it out just a little bit.

28:39.210 --> 28:42.380
The Communist Party is ending
that country's one child policy

28:42.950 --> 28:44.950
as a method of population control.

28:44.990 --> 28:48.920
All couples will now be allowed
to have two children.

28:49.090 --> 28:54.120
Exactly! The one child policy is over,
but a two child policy has begun.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.010
Chinese couples
can do whatever they want,

28:57.030 --> 28:59.920
as long as what they want
is having two children

28:59.950 --> 29:02.010
like the government
wants them to want.

29:02.030 --> 29:06.980
Many couples don't want that. China's
birth rate has fallen to its lowest,

29:07.010 --> 29:10.990
despite the policy shift, due in part
to rising living standards

29:11.010 --> 29:12.970
and the cost of having children.

29:12.990 --> 29:17.140
The Chinese government is pushing
the appeal of two children hard,

29:17.940 --> 29:21.010
in ways that may, by now,
seem a little familiar to you.

29:21.090 --> 29:24.150
There's propaganda, once again,
they've released stamps

29:24.920 --> 29:27.010
showing a happy
monkey with two babies,

29:27.080 --> 29:31.090
there are signs that say things like:
"One is too few, two is just right;"

29:31.110 --> 29:34.150
"The young will have siblings,
the old will be cared for."

29:34.920 --> 29:37.000
There are
government-produced PSA's...

29:37.920 --> 29:42.080
To all our friends of childbearing age,
are you aware that the two child policy

29:42.110 --> 29:45.140
went into effect
on January 1st, 2016?

29:45.850 --> 29:47.940
The reform
of family planning services

29:47.960 --> 29:50.920
will be a great thing
for not only each family,

29:50.940 --> 29:53.820
but also the great family
that makes up China.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.890
Look, I'll grant that that was a very
compelling argument

29:56.910 --> 29:58.910
made by a very sexy cartoon.

29:59.820 --> 30:02.920
We all agree on that, right?
That's a hot 'toon right there.

30:03.900 --> 30:07.950
When you consider...
Now you get it, now you see it.

30:08.030 --> 30:12.980
We've got the same tie on.
That's a copyright infringement.

30:13.930 --> 30:18.890
When you consider all the one
child propaganda before that,

30:18.930 --> 30:20.880
that's pretty jarring to watch.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.940
I haven't seen a turnaround
that abrupt

30:22.960 --> 30:25.910
since Subway changed their slogan
from "eat fresh"

30:25.930 --> 30:27.840
to "forget that pedophile".

30:27.880 --> 30:30.860
It was direct.
You have to give that to them.

30:31.860 --> 30:36.820
Enforcement of the two child policy
is being left to local officials,

30:36.840 --> 30:39.990
so methods for carrying it out
can still vary.

30:40.820 --> 30:42.930
There are concerns
that the low birthrate

30:42.950 --> 30:46.940
is behind a push in some provinces
to tighten access to abortion

30:47.390 --> 30:49.480
and make it more difficult
to get divorced.

30:49.510 --> 30:52.600
And in other areas, where two
is being treated as a hard limit,

30:53.370 --> 30:57.580
people exceeding those limits are
frightened of the worst consequences.

30:58.370 --> 31:01.530
Listen to this man, whose wife
got pregnant with their third child.

31:01.550 --> 31:05.440
He was so terrified, he'd only
talk with his identity disguised.

31:07.480 --> 31:10.510
A third baby is not allowed,
so we went into hiding.

31:10.600 --> 31:14.580
Family planning officers conduct
pregnancy tests every three months.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.480
They would have done
a forced abortion.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.590
And that right there does suggest
the Chinese government

31:22.360 --> 31:24.570
still hasn't learned
the fundamental lesson here:

31:24.600 --> 31:26.500
people are not machines,

31:26.530 --> 31:30.470
whose reproductive systems
can be turned on or off at will.

31:30.500 --> 31:34.410
Pretending otherwise leads
to all the consequences you've seen,

31:34.430 --> 31:37.520
from the entirely foreseeable,
like trauma and heartbreak,

31:37.550 --> 31:41.430
to the less anticipated ones
like delicious little meatballs,

31:41.530 --> 31:43.430
desperate magic tricks

31:43.480 --> 31:46.490
and a factory that can't pump
out sex dolls fast enough.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.450
That image is pretty on-the-nose:

31:49.750 --> 31:53.750
a factory churning out
headless silicone women,

31:53.790 --> 31:57.750
because rocket scientists nearly
40 years ago didn't care enough

31:57.770 --> 31:59.940
about what their policies
might do to real ones.

31:59.960 --> 32:05.730
As China's Communist Party
celebrates its 70 years in power,

32:05.760 --> 32:08.930
it seems worth remembering a massive
way that they used that power.

32:08.950 --> 32:12.780
And if they are running low
on pandas, which they clearly are,

32:12.820 --> 32:16.820
I'd argue that sex dolls might be
a more appropriate tribute.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.870
They've certainly got enough
of them.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.920
So, happy 70th
to the Chinese government.

32:22.930 --> 32:24.870
And now, this.

32:25.910 --> 32:31.960
More Local News Beat Poetry
From NBC4 Washington's Pat Collins.

32:32.930 --> 32:38.840
Two scammers got a shopper inside
Whole Foods talking about rice.

32:38.960 --> 32:43.900
Soon, they disappeared.
And so did her wallet.

32:44.750 --> 32:50.960
See this display case here?
It used to be way over there.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.900
Now, it's back here in what's left
of the break room.

32:56.830 --> 33:00.740
A video chat. She takes off
her clothes,

33:00.800 --> 33:02.810
he takes off his clothes.

33:02.910 --> 33:08.730
And then, sextortion!

33:09.710 --> 33:11.780
The sign over here says "open",

33:11.850 --> 33:17.860
but this morning it was far more
open than they ever intended it to be.

33:19.700 --> 33:23.860
Two days later, same kind
of pick up truck, same M.O.!

33:23.910 --> 33:28.750
In goes the truck!
Down goes the ATM.

33:28.860 --> 33:33.680
ATM here.
Not anymore.

33:33.830 --> 33:39.830
Police say they also seized a car.
A car with flashing lights.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.880
A car with a siren.

33:43.910 --> 33:46.700
A car with police equipment.

33:48.810 --> 33:49.850
It was a Honda.

33:54.770 --> 33:58.710
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week. Goodnight!

33:59.710 --> 34:01.780
