TOM SWIFT #106
"...And the Benefits of Bondage"
Closed Captioned

00:01.418 --> 00:04.086
I'm Tom Swift,
inventor, billionaire,

00:04.129 --> 00:06.006
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.299
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.884
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn

00:09.926 --> 00:11.720
I could earn his love.

00:11.761 --> 00:15.265
But his mission ended
tragically, or so I thought.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.851
Turns out it was sabotage.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.520
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

00:20.562 --> 00:22.814
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.151
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.319
Now, I have to find
the pieces of that capsule

00:28.361 --> 00:30.030
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.198
A global conspiracy called
The Road Back

00:32.240 --> 00:35.702
is standing in my way,
so I can only trust my squad:

00:35.744 --> 00:38.121
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:38.163 --> 00:41.249
my adopted brother Lino,
and my A.I. Barclay.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.001
Together, we're going
to find my father

00:43.043 --> 00:44.711
and bring him home.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.215
(phone line ringing)

00:49.257 --> 00:52.343
(on message):
What's up? It's Tom.
Text me. (beeps)

00:52.385 --> 00:54.846
Hey. Hey, it's me again.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.140
I'm sure by now
your mother has informed you

00:57.182 --> 00:59.017

(exhales) That's because being
your own hype woman takes focus.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.200
I found Tom's watch on the
ground next to his Corvette.

01:57.241 --> 01:58.660
The side mirror
was broken,

01:58.701 --> 02:00.286
and there was a handprint
on the window.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.497
You do know he's meticulous
about his vehicles.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.960
I think Tom's in trouble.

02:07.001 --> 02:10.088
Oh, I can't do nothing
without him

02:10.130 --> 02:11.881
getting in my way!

02:11.923 --> 02:14.092
You know what?
He better be dead,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.970
or I swear to God
I'm gonna kill him.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.472
ISAAC:
Lorraine won't be happy
to see me here.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.808
ZENZI:
Don't worry, she's detoxing
from the cotillion

02:21.850 --> 02:23.059
in Martha's Vineyard.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.772
Barclay, where's Tom?

02:27.814 --> 02:31.484
BARCLAY:
Powering up now.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
Hey, we're gonna find him.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.363
You haven't let
anyone down.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.699
Since when does Barclay
need time to power up?

02:37.740 --> 02:41.369
Tom is late for his
8:00 a.m. cycling class

02:41.411 --> 02:43.954
with Sir Cody Rigsby.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.457
Tom never misses Cody.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.168
Locate his phone, please.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.670
Locating.
Barclay, run an analysis

02:50.712 --> 02:52.130
on this handprint
I just sent you.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.174
You have been released
from your security duties.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.509
Request denied.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.635
Barclay,
just run the print.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.180
Yes, Zenzi.
Unbelievable.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.933
The handprint belongs to Tom.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.437
Tom would never leave
a handprint on a Corvette.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.981
Wh... When did you
last see him?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.858
Just after 7:00 p.m.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.860
I was still looking for him
at 7:50 p.m.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.486
when I left you a voice mail.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.324
7:46 was is I took
my electromagnetic pulse nap.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.702
Tom wouldn't expose Barclay
to an electromagnetic pulse.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.204
Too harsh.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.414
And it would damage
memory access.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.832
Barclay,

03:27.874 --> 03:30.210
what did you see just
before taking that nap?

03:30.251 --> 03:32.378
Technically,
I didn't see anything.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.714
Swift Manor security cameras
did.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.466
As Tom was leaving
the cotillion,

03:36.507 --> 03:38.426
I heard a car screech
to a halt.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.969
(tires screech)

03:40.011 --> 03:42.055
I then heard Tom grunting
and breathing heavily

03:42.096 --> 03:45.558
before his pulse accelerated
to 146 BPM.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.602
That's when I was hit
with an EMP.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.978
From that moment on, I was in
sleep mode till you woke me.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.816
Barclay,
engage side-ho protocol.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.360
Engaging.
What?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.737
It's basically when you give
a spare key to a side-ho

03:57.779 --> 03:59.822
so they can just pop in whenever
no one else is around.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.407
Basically, you and I
will both be able

04:01.449 --> 04:02.909
to access Barclay
on our devices

04:02.951 --> 04:04.202
while we look for Tom.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.411
Might I add
there's still the matter

04:05.453 --> 04:07.038
of capsule piece number four.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.581
Tom was unable
to retrieve it yesterday

04:08.623 --> 04:10.333
due to the Swift jet
being grounded.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.794
No, we can't save Barton
without Tom.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.295
It'll have to wait.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.005
Yeah.
BARCLAY:
Triangulation complete.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.216
Tom's phone is located
in 82 locations

04:18.257 --> 04:19.801
across the state
of New York.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.053
The signal's been cloned
and scattered to throw us off.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.847
Who would have the
resources to do that?

04:29.894 --> 04:31.604
Where did The Road Back
take Tom?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.564
This is the last time
you put your hands on me.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.983
Where is he?

04:35.024 --> 04:37.110
The Road Back did not
kidnap Tom.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.654
If they had, I would have
been the one to do it,

04:39.696 --> 04:41.406

I've been instructed
to observe him.

Observe for what?

05:02.885 --> 05:04.887
Who instructed you?
The congressman?

08:27.089 --> 08:29.175
If Claire destroyed the
capsule piece last night,

08:29.217 --> 08:32.845
then it was probably taken to
the incinerator this morning.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.014
Barclay said that even though
Claire destroyed

08:35.056 --> 08:37.183

08:37.225 --> 08:39.352
Tom was able to retrieve
the information that was on it.

Whoever sent that capsule piece
was probably watching him

long enough to know
that he wanted it.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.358
I mean,
they were probably watching

08:45.399 --> 08:46.484
when he was kidnapped.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.236
Or maybe they're the kidnapper?

08:48.277 --> 08:51.113
Either way, I didn't find
any relevant information

25:23.438 --> 25:25.524
Which room gets the oxygen?

25:26.775 --> 25:29.444
(exhales, groans)

25:42.916 --> 25:44.417
GARRETT:
Three, two...

25:44.459 --> 25:46.628
Room One.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.592
(woman breathing shakily)

25:54.261 --> 25:56.763
GARRETT:
As a courtesy, you now have
intercom privileges.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.057
We appreciate
your participation.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.771
Ma'am? Are you okay?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.319
Guys, I got eyes on you.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.697
Poison is flowing
through the vent.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.907
I-I think the five minutes
on the countdown are for you.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.200
Now,

26:17.242 --> 26:18.994
we are going
to figure this out.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.328
I'll cover the vent.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.205
TOM:
Okay. Search the room.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.292
Tell me everything you find,
ordinary or not.

26:29.087 --> 26:32.465
Uh, I see a speculum
and-and a...

26:32.507 --> 26:35.010
A what?
Oh, to be a cisgender man.
Barclay,

26:35.051 --> 26:38.930
please look up a list of
common OB-GYN tools for Tom.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.974
BARCLAY:
Loading.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.440
(loud whoosh)

26:48.481 --> 26:51.192
Rowan!
I'm fine.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.404
This wall is softer
than the others.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.531
Some kind of weaker composite.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.325
Okay, well,
maybe it's more breakable.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.828
Brilliant.
Um, let's try something.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.542
Move a foot to your left and

27:07.584 --> 27:09.836
ram the wall with your shoulder.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.343
Okay, the barrier
to the room is thin.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.553
If you can create
an opening for it,

27:18.595 --> 27:20.347
we can get enough oxygen
to you. Um...

27:20.388 --> 27:21.723
We just need a drill.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.350
I'm not seeing a drill.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.852
You're gonna invent one.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.648
(wrist device beeps)

27:29.689 --> 27:31.107
Rowan,

27:31.149 --> 27:32.567
take that stool to the wall

27:32.609 --> 27:34.361
and turn it around,
all right?

27:34.402 --> 27:37.322
Uh, and Zenzi and Isaac,
grab the speculum

27:37.364 --> 27:40.075
and a T-shaped screw that's
shaped like a wine opener.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.743
Then I want you to use
the medical tape

27:41.785 --> 27:44.537
to enclose the speculum bill
around the screw.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.422
Now, fasten the speculum to

27:54.464 --> 27:56.841
the underside of the stem,
face up.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.718
Then I want you to take
the chair legs to the wall

27:58.760 --> 28:00.720
and turn the seat
like a wheel.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.180
Hold on. Bring it down,
bring it down, bring it down.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.516
Yeah, just like that.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.935
Okay.

28:06.976 --> 28:10.397
All right.

28:10.438 --> 28:12.065
TOM:
As you open a hole
in the wall,

28:12.107 --> 28:15.402
the balance of nitrogen
and oxygen will even out.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.156
Okay. Okay, uh...

28:21.616 --> 28:23.952
...inhale and hold it now.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.912
(air hissing)

28:25.954 --> 28:28.206
(Rowan coughing)

28:35.505 --> 28:38.091
No, that's--
You should have enough air.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.095
Oh, we're good.
We're through.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.057
(Zenzi gasping)
Isaac!

28:55.233 --> 28:57.902
(gasping)

29:05.702 --> 29:07.871
For the record,
this is my second

29:07.912 --> 29:10.415
life or death vagina room.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.625
Girl, it's like you don't even
remember Vegas.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.097
TOM:
No. No, no, no! No!

29:26.139 --> 29:27.932
No!

29:30.018 --> 29:31.978
Ma'am.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.188
BARCLAY:
More bad news.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.522
The Utah capsule
has gone dark.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.565
We've lost it.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.317
TOM:
Oh, no.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.123
(coughs, gasps)

30:00.673 --> 30:03.510
Mom? Mom?!

30:03.551 --> 30:04.928
Lino?

30:05.845 --> 30:07.972
Is everyone...

30:10.517 --> 30:12.644
GARRETT:
Welcome home, Tom.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.361
GARRETT:
Put your glasses on.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.618
BARCLAY:
Prying eyes activated.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.625
GARRETT:
After Tulsa, we tried
to protect ourselves.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.129
Garvey and his pan-Africanists,

30:40.171 --> 30:43.132
the Leaders of
the Black Freedom Movement.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.224
Rustin.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.018
Parks.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.901
From the SCLC to SNCC

31:01.943 --> 31:06.698
to the Panthers, we tried.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.284
And in doing so,

31:09.325 --> 31:12.161
we went through trials
of our own.

31:12.203 --> 31:16.207
Picked ourselves up,
built something new.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.753
We weren't as public
as others,

31:20.795 --> 31:23.339
but we funded movements.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.843
Mutual aid, bail.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.345
Scholarships.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.472
(protestors chanting)

31:32.974 --> 31:35.184
We learned hard lessons.

31:42.775 --> 31:46.404
But everything we did

31:46.446 --> 31:48.907
led to you.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.752
(glasses blip)

32:03.671 --> 32:06.799
According to these shades,

32:06.841 --> 32:08.927
you're dead, Garrett.

32:10.345 --> 32:14.849
And for your sake,
my friends better not be.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.102
We're getting your friends help.

32:20.521 --> 32:21.481
But right now...

32:21.522 --> 32:23.316
I need yours.

32:25.693 --> 32:26.819
Mom?

32:34.452 --> 32:38.164
You stole my face filter
prototype

32:38.206 --> 32:42.669
and made some adjustments,

32:42.710 --> 32:44.128
I see.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.424
Where are my friends?

32:48.466 --> 32:51.552
They're being given
top medical care.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.805
They'll wake up in their cars
in a few hours.

32:53.846 --> 32:57.684
Mm. So now they matter to you?

32:57.725 --> 33:01.396
The company you keep will matter
more than ever now.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.606
It's why I pushed
Justin toward you.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.316
I wanted you to have
worthy confidantes

33:05.358 --> 33:06.651
for what's coming.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.195
But it seems you already
chose good ones.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.198
So you were testing them, too.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.369
They pounced on the soil sample
we left in the observatory.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.038
Raced right into danger
for you.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.082
Zenzi, especially,
kept her head

33:21.124 --> 33:23.209
when others were
losing theirs.

33:23.251 --> 33:26.713
You counted on her recalling
the epinephrine compound?

33:26.754 --> 33:28.589
Mom, I was 12 the last time
I needed one.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.259
And yet she stepped up,
as did the others,

33:31.300 --> 33:33.344
during the final trial.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.513
And because you were able
to count on your friends,

33:35.555 --> 33:37.807
you were able to save
that woman, too.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.394
Except you staged it all.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.313
Why?

33:48.693 --> 33:52.071
You know the Tubman group
for its cotillions.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.574
But there's a sub-group
within it.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.534
We kept it secret.

33:57.160 --> 34:01.414
Since Tulsa, a select group
of Black Americans,

34:01.456 --> 34:04.792
including your grandfather,
worked to amass

34:04.834 --> 34:07.378
concentrated
and undetected wealth.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.215
They aimed to form a society

34:11.257 --> 34:13.842
untainted by white supremacy.

34:14.761 --> 34:17.679
Like a safe space.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.100
We've been thinking
outer space.

34:21.141 --> 34:23.853
A planet of our own.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.982
The idea came to us
27 years ago.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.944
Your father was
at a conference...

34:33.237 --> 34:35.156
...and I was
six months pregnant.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.784
Alexandra came early.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.328
I had a sister?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.790
Your father tried
to race home.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.083
And when I called 911,
I was in so much pain

34:46.125 --> 34:47.793
I could barely think.

34:48.878 --> 34:52.672
WOMAN (recorded):
Help! Please!

34:52.715 --> 34:54.592
Please, someone help me!

35:05.311 --> 35:07.188
That was you?

35:10.024 --> 35:13.277
I was alone and
in premature labor.

35:13.319 --> 35:16.280
And after, I was so afraid

35:16.322 --> 35:20.034
that once I saw a doctor,
I trusted him completely.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.079
His name was
Dr. Garrett.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.499
He dismissed my symptoms
of gestational diabetes

35:26.541 --> 35:30.169
that he should have diagnosed;
symptoms I told him about.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.172
And because he ignored me,

35:33.214 --> 35:35.133
I never saw your sister
open her eyes.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.470
Hypoxia.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.472
(sighs heavily)

35:41.931 --> 35:46.519
Running out of air
in a contained space.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.607
She was a stillborn.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.359
Yes.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.403
Due to the diabetes.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.281
And you were all alone.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.117
Not entirely.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.162
They did let me hold her
at the end.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.503
(voice breaking):
Mom...

36:14.839 --> 36:17.925
...I am so sorry.

36:17.967 --> 36:20.094
I had no idea.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.722
For a long time,

36:22.763 --> 36:26.851
I didn't know
how many other Black women

36:26.893 --> 36:29.812
had similar stories
about their doctors...

36:31.606 --> 36:33.566
...or how this system
hurts all of us.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.068
Which is why your father
dreamt of a new home

36:36.110 --> 36:38.029
for Black people.

36:38.070 --> 36:40.865
We call it
the Mountaintop Station.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.827
And you want me to join it?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.913
No, Tom.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.207
We want you to build it.

36:49.248 --> 36:53.252
And Swift Enterprises is
its only chance at funding.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.255
You see, I-I was afraid
that if you couldn't handle

36:56.297 --> 36:58.216
being CEO,
this was beyond you.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.384
Okay, then why bring me in now?

37:00.426 --> 37:02.637
You were there
for my sister.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.723
Hey, shh, listen.
(crying)

37:05.765 --> 37:07.975
Look at this little invention
I created, huh?

37:08.017 --> 37:10.311
Wanna put that on?

37:10.353 --> 37:12.897
LORRAINE:
You looked out for Quinn.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.191
Claire's assistant, Quinn.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.360
Can I promote them to R&D?

37:17.401 --> 37:19.737
They have some very
useful ideas.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.282
You owned up to everything.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.410
Maybe I was too harsh
about your suspension.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.621
You showed great
leadership tonight.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.956
But I've been careless
of my actions

37:29.997 --> 37:31.666
and how they affect others.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.459
LORRAINE:
Just like the man
I knew you were.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.048
(phone line ringing)

37:41.384 --> 37:44.637
And frankly, our timetable
has been accelerated.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.223
Look, we're no CIA, but we know
people are looking into us.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.810
And after the-the brutal,
one-sided police response

37:50.851 --> 37:53.145
to protest in 2020,
some of us believe

37:53.187 --> 37:55.356
that the Mountaintop Station
was overdue.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.192
Okay. Then why didn't you
just tell me about it?

37:58.234 --> 38:00.319
If I treated you
any differently

38:00.361 --> 38:02.405
than any other recruit,
they wouldn't let you in.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.115
You all had to go through

38:04.156 --> 38:06.492
torture-porn-hell-week
back there?

38:06.534 --> 38:08.744
Well, some form of it.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.998
To communicate
the Tubman principles,

38:12.039 --> 38:14.875
and to see which candidates
embodied them.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.170
Your first trial,

38:18.212 --> 38:20.006
it took after our mantra.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.049
"Invent the power

38:22.091 --> 38:24.885
your freedom requires."
Your freedom requires.

38:24.927 --> 38:28.848
And the second was
a test of integrity.

38:28.889 --> 38:31.100
And you never
used your ring.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.019
(both chuckle)

38:33.060 --> 38:34.186
So you knew what it could do.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.938
Well, we leave cheat items

38:35.980 --> 38:38.024
on the person
of every candidate.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.900
As for the third trial,

38:39.942 --> 38:42.695
we needed to know that
you'd help the collective,

38:42.737 --> 38:45.698
even at the risk
of personal cost.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.159
The woman you saw on the gurney
is from the Tubman Group,

38:48.200 --> 38:50.119
and she's okay, don't worry.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.330
But we did monitor
the safety of your friends,

38:52.371 --> 38:54.248
down to the laser intensity.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.001
The nitrogen was diluted.

38:57.543 --> 39:00.379
But Rowan's lungs were
more contaminated than usual

39:00.421 --> 39:01.797
for someone his age.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.425
We would have resuscitated him
if Isaac hadn't.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.344
So send our apologies.

39:06.385 --> 39:10.139
So I can talk to them
about all this?

39:10.181 --> 39:14.727
Well, I'd like to have
a private discussion with Isaac,

39:14.769 --> 39:17.146
but he and the others
are approved.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.189
That is, if you'll join us.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.192
I'm in. I'm in.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.861
Well, I am proud to have you.

39:23.903 --> 39:28.824
