32:50.886 --> 32:53.763
It seems like a dragnet
on all Russian citizens.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.198
Yes.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.691
So, situation-type room.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.985
This is, uh,
commando raids and stuff?

34:08.797 --> 34:11.132
What happened?

34:21.559 --> 34:23.478
(man speaking over computer)

35:01.933 --> 35:03.518
(man speaking over computer)

35:41.723 --> 35:43.475
Are those real airplanes
back there?

35:43.475 --> 35:45.727
(Putin speaking)

35:46.978 --> 35:49.564
Stone: Access
to submarines?

36:43.743 --> 36:47.789
So, in conventional
military terms, your budget,
as you said,

36:47.789 --> 36:50.709
the American budget
is 600 billion.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.961
Your annual budget is 66,

36:52.961 --> 36:54.754
according
to the Russian statistics.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.340
Sixty-six.
That's almost a tenth,

36:57.340 --> 37:00.176
uh, twelve percent roughly
of American spending.

37:00.176 --> 37:04.597
The Chinese are
at 215 billion, 215.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.393
Saudi Arabia's at 87,

37:08.393 --> 37:12.188
which leaves Russia
fourth place at 66.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.773
Is this
an accurate figure?

37:15.525 --> 37:18.361
Whoa. Saudi Arabia's spending
more money than you are.

37:21.823 --> 37:25.827
How do you do it?
I mean, you have
quite an army.

37:25.827 --> 37:29.622
I mean, quite
an intelligence economy.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.375
But what's the trick?
I mean, how do you--

37:32.375 --> 37:34.586
You don't have lobbies
that cost a lot of money?

37:34.586 --> 37:38.548
You don't--
No graft, no corruption
in this thing?

38:21.841 --> 38:22.926
The US makes a lot
out of building up.

38:22.926 --> 38:27.430
They keep talking about
its antimissile systems.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.932
Is there a reason to believe
there's been some kind
of breakthrough

38:28.932 --> 38:31.434
in their technology?

38:31.434 --> 38:33.853
Some kind of
first-strike superiority?

38:42.779 --> 38:46.950
But they have a,
they have a plan--
They're doing something.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.370
I feel that they really
are working, that they can
get an advantage

38:50.370 --> 38:54.999
in which your missile silos
would be knocked out
on a US first strike.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.002
And we'd be able to absorb
whatever you had left
to throw at us.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.630
But then we'd warn you

39:00.630 --> 39:02.674
that we're going to be hitting
you again with a second strike,

39:02.674 --> 39:06.928
and that would really wipe out
your cities, your population,
the whole works.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.828
Stone:
<i>In the matter of Syria,</i>
<i>can you describe</i>

39:31.828 --> 39:33.663
what your objective was?

39:33.663 --> 39:35.665
Give us a little history of that
and where you are now?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.392
Who's they? The terrorists.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.019
(Putin speaking)

41:01.584 --> 41:02.210
Stone:
<i>This is the biggest concern?</i>

41:02.210 --> 41:03.753
(Putin speaking)

42:14.991 --> 42:16.826
And, uh, the roads that ISIS
were using to drive

42:16.826 --> 42:20.705
<i>the trucks to, uh,</i>
<i>to Turkey, the oil trucks?</i>

42:21.164 --> 42:24.000
(Putin speaking)

42:37.847 --> 42:38.931
Stone:
<i>Right.</i>

42:46.314 --> 42:49.067
And you confronted Erdogan
with this information, correct?

42:51.778 --> 42:53.863
You were hitting
Turkmen areas,

42:53.863 --> 42:57.200
<i>and you didn't tell him,</i>
<i>uh, why?</i>

42:57.200 --> 42:59.786
(Putin speaking)

43:08.086 --> 43:11.005
Could you have said
in a diplomatic way,

43:11.005 --> 43:13.925
uh, Mr. President, uh,
we have information,
good information

43:13.925 --> 43:18.137
that the oil is coming
into certain places in Turkey,

43:18.137 --> 43:20.681
and we believe that
there are elements
in Turkey on the border,

43:20.681 --> 43:23.226
smugglers that are cooperating
with ISIS

43:23.226 --> 43:26.062
and bringing the oil in,
and we're very concerned
about that?

43:26.062 --> 43:28.731
(laughing)

43:35.863 --> 43:36.906
(translating)

44:20.324 --> 44:21.909
Who from the United States
was in that room?

44:30.668 --> 44:34.672
So two times a day,
tomorrow, uh, today,

44:34.672 --> 44:38.968
you'll give information to NATO
as to when the missions
are in Syria.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.182
To-- Oh, really?
Directly.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.685
And you get
the same information?

44:52.315 --> 44:54.984
To prevent
major catastrophes?

44:57.987 --> 44:59.697
Yeah. This is
a dangerous situation.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.093
Stone:
I know.

45:40.655 --> 45:42.031
So they're illegal.

45:42.031 --> 45:44.533
Any foreign troops
coming to Syria

45:44.533 --> 45:46.494
-without our invitation...
-Man: Mm-hmm.

45:46.494 --> 45:49.872
...or consultation
or permission,
they are invaders.

46:01.968 --> 46:06.055
So we have French airplanes,
we have British, uh, fighters,

46:06.055 --> 46:09.016
we have Turkish fighters,
and now we have--

46:09.016 --> 46:09.934
Is there another one
I missed?

46:18.067 --> 46:19.819
-Stone: Oh, really?
-Yeah, really so.

46:19.819 --> 46:22.488
Australians?
This is--

46:22.488 --> 46:24.407
-And Canada.
-Mm.

46:24.407 --> 46:26.742
What about Iran?
No Iranian air force?

46:28.744 --> 46:31.580
So, it's pretty hot
air space, I'd say.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.874
Putin: <i>Uh...</i> (sighs)

46:52.393 --> 46:54.478
You're making 72
to a 100 airstrikes a day?

46:54.478 --> 46:56.439
Seven days a week?

46:56.439 --> 46:57.106
-Yes. Yes.
-Wow.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.112
And, uh... (exhales)
so there must be
some progress I would think?

47:03.112 --> 47:05.406
We're not gonna have
a Vietnam-type situation here,
are we?

47:05.906 --> 47:07.408
You see progress?

48:05.758 --> 48:08.886
It seems to me
if you're striking 70
to a 120 times a day

48:08.886 --> 48:12.431
at least two months,
that's 60 days.

48:12.431 --> 48:15.810
We're down to four
to seven thousand strikes?

48:15.810 --> 48:17.061
How big is ISIS?
How big is this thing?

48:42.753 --> 48:44.088
Who's on the ground?

49:03.065 --> 49:04.650
But they don't have
Stingers?

49:08.154 --> 49:10.156
These people have fought
you before in Afghanistan.

49:14.660 --> 49:15.744
Yeah.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.079
So they were surprised?

49:19.206 --> 49:23.127
I think it'd be a good--
It's an anti-recruitment
poster for ISIS.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.463
<i>You wouldn't want to join ISIS</i>
<i>if you saw that poster.</i>

49:31.302 --> 49:34.096
(Putin speaking)

50:18.599 --> 50:19.808
Let's talk about
another war situation.

50:19.808 --> 50:22.811
In the Crimean,
when the referendum
was coming up,

50:22.811 --> 50:26.273
the US destroyer <i>Donald Cook</i>
was apparently

50:26.273 --> 50:28.442
<i>coming right into the Black Sea</i>

50:28.442 --> 50:31.362
<i>when it made a U-turn</i>
<i>and didn't carry through</i>
<i>its mission.</i>

50:31.362 --> 50:34.323
<i>It seems like it was similar</i>
<i>to the Cuban Missile Crisis</i>

50:34.323 --> 50:38.536
<i>when the same thing happened</i>
<i>where a ship was coming towards</i>

50:38.536 --> 50:40.246
<i>the demarcation line</i>
<i>and made a U-turn.</i>

51:01.141 --> 51:05.062
Rising tensions
between the US and Russia
after a Russian fighter jet

51:05.062 --> 51:07.523
<i>buzzed a US warship</i>
<i>in the Black Sea.</i>

51:07.523 --> 51:09.567
<i>ABC Chief Global Affairs</i>
<i>Correspondent Martha Raddatz</i>

51:09.567 --> 51:11.443
<i>is tracking this all</i>
<i>from Washington.</i>

51:11.443 --> 51:14.363
<i>Martha, this maneuver</i>
<i>by the Russian fighter</i>
<i>carries echoes of the Cold War.</i>

51:14.363 --> 51:17.199
It certainly does, George.
This was a Russian jet

51:17.199 --> 51:19.910
<i>that screamed by</i>
<i>a US destroyer</i>
<i>in the Black Sea,</i>

51:19.910 --> 51:23.038
<i>not just once</i>
<i>but 12 times</i>

51:23.038 --> 51:24.957
<i>over a</i>
<i>90-minute period.</i>

51:24.957 --> 51:28.168
(Russian newsman speaking)

51:42.308 --> 51:43.726
(Putin speaking)

51:43.726 --> 51:45.060
Stone:
Yeah.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.280
(translator speaking)

52:04.705 --> 52:05.247
Bastion,
was it called?

52:08.250 --> 52:11.086
Stone: <i>But this</i>
<i>is a big missile.</i>

52:11.086 --> 52:14.923
<i>And the destroyer,</i>
<i>the</i> Donald Cook
<i>has Tomahawk missiles.</i>

52:14.923 --> 52:16.675
(Putin speaking)

52:21.013 --> 52:22.222
Stone:
<i>That's probably why</i>
<i>it turned around.</i>

52:22.222 --> 52:25.643
But your commander had
the authority to fire.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.353
(Putin speaking)

52:34.735 --> 52:36.278
Stone: <i>Still,</i>
<i>it's a big incident,</i>
<i>potentially.</i>

52:47.247 --> 52:50.376
What time frame did
all this take place?
This challenge?

53:41.677 --> 53:43.345
Was he warned? Was there
a warning sent out to him?

53:50.185 --> 53:52.020
All this thing takes place
in two minutes?

53:52.020 --> 53:53.522
Thirty minutes?
Fifty minutes?

53:56.316 --> 53:59.194
I mean, does this
happen all the time?

53:59.194 --> 54:00.863
He sounds very cool.

54:00.863 --> 54:03.240
Were you... (chuckles)
Were you contacted?

54:12.374 --> 54:13.542
He admits to the brink.

54:16.336 --> 54:19.214
Well, finally,
you're admitting it.

54:26.722 --> 54:28.682
Stone: Yeah.

54:33.562 --> 54:34.438
Yes.

54:42.237 --> 54:44.656
At that time,
you made a speech.

54:44.656 --> 54:47.743
"This is our historic territory.
These are Russian people.

54:47.743 --> 54:50.579
<i>"They are in danger now.</i>

54:50.579 --> 54:53.248
<i>"We can't leave them alone.</i>

54:53.248 --> 54:55.542
<i>"It wasn't us</i>
<i>who staged the coup,</i>

54:55.542 --> 54:57.252
<i>"it was done by nationalists</i>

54:57.252 --> 54:59.963
<i>"and people</i>
<i>with far-right views.</i>

54:59.963 --> 55:03.300
<i>"You supported them.</i>
<i>But where do you live?</i>

55:03.300 --> 55:05.469
<i>"Five thousand miles away.</i>

55:05.469 --> 55:09.139
"But we live here,
and it is our land.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.600
"What do you want
to fight for there?

55:11.600 --> 55:14.061
<i>"You don't know, do you?</i>
<i>But we do know.</i>

55:14.061 --> 55:15.729
<i>And we are ready for it."</i>

55:17.231 --> 55:19.316
Stone:
<i>Is there any hope?</i>

55:42.005 --> 55:43.423
So he's an optimist.

55:46.009 --> 55:48.178
(translator speaks)

57:16.725 --> 57:18.810
Or Moscow will be
a caliphate.

57:21.271 --> 57:22.981
(both laugh)

57:24.232 --> 57:26.068
Thank you.

57:26.068 --> 57:28.528
Well, you came close.

57:28.528 --> 57:30.614
And now you're close again,
so it seems to be

57:30.614 --> 57:33.075
a very tense presidency
you have.
