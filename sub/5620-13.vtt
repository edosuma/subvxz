to pick Edie up in two hours.

00:07.667 --> 00:09.250
Are you listening me to me?

00:09.333 --> 00:10.667
No, this crazy girl
I went out with

00:10.750 --> 00:11.875
a couple weeks ago
keeps texting me.

00:11.959 --> 00:13.041
She won't leave me alone.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.375
Kind of like you guys.

00:14.458 --> 00:15.875
So she's still texting you

00:15.959 --> 00:17.208
even after you told her
you weren't interested?

00:17.291 --> 00:18.875
I didn't tell her that.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.834
I'm ghosting her, see?

00:20.917 --> 00:22.750
Oh, it's this cool new thing
where you ignore someone

00:22.834 --> 00:24.041
who likes you
until they go away.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.583
Ooh, "ghosting," huh?
Mm-hmm.

00:25.667 --> 00:26.875
So I guess I've been
ghosting the gym

00:26.959 --> 00:28.667

00:28.750 --> 00:30.625

JIMMY: She's not nice,
she's crazy.

Eh, what do you know?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.208
(singsongy):
Don't kill our granddaughter.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.875
Don't tell me
what to do.

00:39.959 --> 00:41.875
JIMMY: Bye.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.041
Your grandmother doesn't
understand us young people.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.917
Ghosting's totally on flick.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.208
Flack.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.000
That's not right,
is it?

00:49.083 --> 00:51.583
Edie, what do you got
here, a magazine?

And the only time you let me win
is when you want me happy

Is that what's happening here?

01:34.500 --> 01:36.166
No. You just outplayed me.

You jumped the fence

02:39.792 --> 02:41.083
and stormed his security detail

02:41.166 --> 02:43.709
so you could give him
a personal invitation.

across social media

03:26.125 --> 03:27.458

flautist, Borgshaft.

You don't even know what you're
talking about, Victor, okay?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.792
Borgshaft basically invented
alt-electro dirge pop.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.166
Pitchfork just said he's, like,
"the next Flardsgaard."

04:06.250 --> 04:08.542

conflict another time.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.125

04:48.208 --> 04:49.500
Annelise can't find
this Chason kid,

04:49.583 --> 04:51.000
so I need you to hack
into his server

04:51.083 --> 04:52.208
and triangulate his location.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.083
You know I'm not
a hacker, right?

04:54.166 --> 04:55.333
And besides, hacking's a crime

04:55.417 --> 04:56.834
and I definitely
don't want to go to jail

04:56.917 --> 04:58.375

He's at a tattoo parlor
in Hollywood.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.166
How'd you figure that out?

05:01.250 --> 05:02.542
He just posted,

05:02.625 --> 05:03.709
"I'm at a tattoo parlor
in Hollywood."

05:03.792 --> 05:04.667

Hey, Cooper,
hook it up, all right?

06:44.667 --> 06:46.250
So we're super excited
for Saturday.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.583
Just a heads up:
Chason can be a bit demanding.

06:48.667 --> 06:51.625
When he says "some friends,"
it's usually somewhere
in the 90-120 range.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.000
Oh, also, he's on
a real '80s kick lately,

06:54.083 --> 06:55.417
so if you could, like, deck out
the place, that'd be great.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.291
Actually, you have
to do that.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.083

now's the time to back out.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.000
No. No, no, no, no.

We'll see you Saturday night.

07:12.834 --> 07:13.917
Okay.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.834
No.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.458
Okay, well, let's give
my dolphin a friend.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.583
This is good. Very '80s.
We got a pinball machine,

07:28.667 --> 07:30.000
(musical tone plays)

07:30.083 --> 07:31.166
Oh, look at this.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.542
(musical tones playing)

07:39.291 --> 07:41.417
Happy now? Okay.
Yeah.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.917
Ravi, I never thought
I'd say this,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.208
but how are we
on the tableside guac?

07:44.291 --> 07:45.709
We are guaced and loaded, boss.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.875
Now, look, I know we're doing
this just because of Chason,

07:47.959 --> 07:50.917
but I really think when you see
this baby on its feet, you...

07:51.000 --> 07:52.750
I can't believe this.

07:52.834 --> 07:55.208
Chason Fairwick is gonna be
in this restaurant.

07:55.291 --> 07:58.375
No, Chason specifically said
no maroon.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.291
Do you want to have
that conversation with him?

08:01.458 --> 08:02.792
You seem very tense.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.208
What happened to the fun,

08:04.291 --> 08:05.834
freewheeling Jimmy
we've come to love?

08:05.917 --> 08:07.792
That Jimmy brought shame
upon this restaurant.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.208
But tonight,
that's all gonna change

08:09.291 --> 08:11.125
with a little help
from my friend Chason...

08:11.208 --> 08:12.208
Fairwick.
Fairwick.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.834
Now, he's gonna come in,
we're gonna impress him,

08:13.917 --> 08:15.208
he's gonna promote us,

08:15.291 --> 08:16.750

right back on top.

Uh, uh, question.
I know the drinks are free,

Hmm, thank you.

Chason's coming in

Hey. Welcome.

Hey, what's up, man?
I'm Chason.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.709
I know. I met you
at the tattoo parlor.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.417
Listen, Chason, we've, uh,

09:48.500 --> 09:50.000
we've done everything, uh,

09:50.083 --> 09:51.750
to make tonight as great
as possible for you.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.333
My goal is,
if you have a good time,

09:53.417 --> 09:55.333
that you'll tell everyone
how great Jimmy's is.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.333
Cool. Hey, so what's
with all the decorations?

09:57.417 --> 09:58.709
This, like, an '80s restaurant?

09:58.792 --> 10:00.417
No, no, your assistant said

10:00.500 --> 10:02.333
that you were going
through an '80s phase, so...

10:02.417 --> 10:04.709
Oh, I guess so.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.125
Hey, which wall
do I get to paint?

10:07.208 --> 10:09.208

Boss?

10:13.208 --> 10:14.500
I can't work like this.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.333
These avocados are a little firm
for tableside.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.041
People don't want to see me
struggle through the mash.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.333
No, I got it.

10:22.417 --> 10:23.500
I wonder if he knows

10:23.583 --> 10:24.750
he's not a good musician?

10:24.834 --> 10:26.083
Nobody put a $20
in that tip jar.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.792
He put that in himself.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.208
Somebody's got to tell him.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.417
You know, and if I
don't, who will?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.375
Do you see the psychology here?

10:32.458 --> 10:33.667
He's trying to get people

10:33.750 --> 10:34.875
to tip him bigger.

10:34.959 --> 10:37.041
Screw it, I'm going in.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.375
Here you go.

10:38.458 --> 10:41.041
Thank you.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.375
I can't just put
a dollar in there.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.250
It's gonna make me look cheap
next that $20.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.041
I guess I'll just
give him a $20.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.500
(laughs)

10:52.583 --> 10:55.417
You clever little bastard.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.375
I was watching these videos of
Kesha giving her fans tattoos,

10:58.458 --> 11:00.375
and I was like,
"That is so badass."

11:00.458 --> 11:03.750
So I asked my lawyer
if I could steal the idea,

11:03.834 --> 11:05.542
and he's like,
"Yeah, I guess."

11:05.625 --> 11:07.417

11:07.500 --> 11:09.375
Here we go. You know,
I'm not that good at it yet,

11:09.458 --> 11:10.792
but curves are hard.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.166
Hey, Chason, I need to tell
you something, all right?

11:13.250 --> 11:14.750
Something you need to know.
You might be rich and famous,

11:14.834 --> 11:16.583
and loved by everyone,

11:16.667 --> 11:18.917
and even more handsome up close
than you are on TV...

11:19.000 --> 11:20.542
Wow, thank you so much
for saying that.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.667
No, no, no, there's a
big finish here. You are...

11:22.750 --> 11:24.417

are afraid

11:24.500 --> 11:25.917

11:28.542 --> 11:29.959

don't like that name.

14:47.959 --> 14:48.959
That's not racist.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.083
(Chason laughs)

14:50.166 --> 14:51.125
Nice.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.667
All right.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.917
So the first thing
you want to do

14:54.000 --> 14:56.458
is find a nice and ripe avocado.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.875
This one will have to do;
I didn't buy them.

14:58.959 --> 15:01.250
Listen, I've really tried
to deliver for you tonight,

15:01.333 --> 15:02.875
so I was hoping you could
do something for me.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.500
I don't think so. I'm just
trying to have fun tonight, man.

15:05.583 --> 15:06.875
I want you to have fun.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.250
Can we just talk
some business first?

15:09.333 --> 15:11.250
Hey, we can talk
business later, okay?

15:11.333 --> 15:12.959
You know what we should do now?

15:13.959 --> 15:14.875
This guy.

15:14.959 --> 15:15.875
He'll get a tattoo.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.125
Total ink head.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.375
Right?

15:19.083 --> 15:20.917
Oh, those are forever.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.083
As tempting as it...
as it-it looks,

15:24.166 --> 15:26.583
uh, my regular tat
guy would not...

15:26.667 --> 15:28.625
he would just
not like this.
(sighs)

15:28.709 --> 15:29.917
He gets so jealous.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.709
(chanting):
Do it.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.417
Do it. Do it...

15:33.500 --> 15:34.834
You guys like a little kick?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.709
ALL (chanting):
Do it! Do it!

15:36.792 --> 15:41.208
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

15:41.291 --> 15:42.959
All right.

15:43.041 --> 15:43.959
Let's do it!

15:44.041 --> 15:45.917
Yeah!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.458
Let's do this!
That's my boy!

15:47.542 --> 15:50.250
And now we celebrate
with a little guacamole.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.166
(chuckles)

15:52.250 --> 15:53.166
You know what?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.208
I don't like this light.

15:54.291 --> 15:55.709
Come on. Let's go.

15:55.792 --> 15:57.625
Oh.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.542
Okay. Yeah.
Okay.
Let's get out of here.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.208
Wait, Gerald, do you want to
take the guac with you?

16:02.291 --> 16:04.041
Oh, hey, buddy...

16:05.041 --> 16:08.083
This is my "guacalypse" now.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.959
Hey. Isn't this cool?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.333
What is that?
Is that a tattoo?

16:12.417 --> 16:14.667
Yeah, Chason
gave it to me.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.458
It-it's "C" for Chason.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.709
He said curves are hard.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.709
(scoffs)

16:21.792 --> 16:24.000
Ugh, you remember
when that was us?

16:24.083 --> 16:26.041
Back in the actual '80s?

16:26.125 --> 16:28.458
We were young, having a blast,

16:28.542 --> 16:30.250
not worrying about
what anybody thought.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.041
Look at me, I'm turning
my whole life upside down

16:32.125 --> 16:33.542
trying to please
some Bieber wannabe

16:33.625 --> 16:34.959
for a tweet
I'll probably never get.

16:35.041 --> 16:38.291
You did all of this for a tweet?

16:38.375 --> 16:40.875
Ew, don't tell
other people that.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.208
You know, I used to get a kick

16:42.291 --> 16:44.208
out of hustling
for the restaurant, but now?

16:44.291 --> 16:46.000
Like, how far is too far?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.000
It's just a guess,
but I'd say letting

16:48.083 --> 16:51.083
a one-hit wonder brand you
for life with a dirty needle.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.250
Eh, who am I to talk?

16:53.333 --> 16:54.542
I mean, what am I
even doing here?

16:54.625 --> 16:55.834
I look ridiculous.

16:55.917 --> 16:57.417
You look like
a roadie for Heart.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.208
A cool roadie.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.625
Remember what we did last time
you wore an outfit like that?

17:01.709 --> 17:03.000
(trills tongue)
Yes.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.000
But the last time I wore
an outfit like this,

17:05.083 --> 17:07.542
you didn't have that
thing on your arm.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.000
Oh, I got to get this
disinfected.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.542
Annelise!

17:12.083 --> 17:13.542
You're still here?

17:13.625 --> 17:15.000
Rock on, girl.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.875
My mom would so
be asleep by now.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.375
(laughs dryly)

17:19.458 --> 17:20.875
♪ ♪

17:20.959 --> 17:22.917
Okay, here it comes.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.208
And... okay, wait
for my go-kart.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.208
Okay.
And...

17:26.291 --> 17:27.709
You see it?
Hey.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.041
(laughs)

17:29.125 --> 17:30.500
Crazy.
Sick, right?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.041
So sick.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.834
that's not as-as good as this,
but I'll find it.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.875
How important would you
say tonight is for my dad?

17:36.959 --> 17:38.875
You were with your dad
when he read that rumor

17:38.959 --> 17:41.041
about Padma Lakshmi's marriage
being on the rocks, right?

17:41.125 --> 17:42.667
Yeah, it was the first
time he hugged me.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.458
He wants this more than Padma.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.458
He loves this restaurant
more than anything.

17:47.417 --> 17:49.291
More than Padma?
Oh, my God.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.250
Barkeep!

17:53.333 --> 17:55.250
I'm yelling at you!

17:55.333 --> 17:57.250
At the top of my lungs!

17:57.333 --> 17:59.709
(women chattering)

18:01.125 --> 18:03.041
(sighs)
What am I, invisible?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.667
I see you.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.667
I'm Kyle.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.542
I'm Sara.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.333
I'm about to head out.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.166
Any chance you want to head
to a party in Silver Lake?

18:15.625 --> 18:16.542
Hold that thought.

18:16.625 --> 18:17.542
Here, come with me.

18:17.625 --> 18:18.625
Okay.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.458
(gasps)
Hey, yoo-hoo.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.667
See this hot young guy?

18:26.750 --> 18:28.583
He just asked me
to leave with him.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.709
So, yeah, "good
for me" is right.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.792
Yeah, that's what I said,
good for you.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.834
Yeah, but you said
it with a tone.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.667
Hey, so does that mean
you want to come?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.667
You're sweet, but no.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.792
I'm, like, 20 years
older than you.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.291
Whoa, you're 38?

18:44.375 --> 18:46.333
Yes.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.125
Yes, I am.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.125
All right, so
what do you want?

18:50.208 --> 18:51.709
You want a "C"
for Chason?

18:51.792 --> 18:53.208
"A" for Abe?

18:53.291 --> 18:54.709
What's smaller?

18:54.792 --> 18:56.291
Gerald, what
are you doing?

18:56.375 --> 18:57.625
Oh, he's still deciding.

18:58.709 --> 18:59.625
No, no, you know what,

18:59.709 --> 19:00.917
Chason, he's not deciding.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.208
Chason, I've taken
your crap all night.

19:03.291 --> 19:05.208
I-I've gone further
than I thought I would.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.208
There's a line, okay?

19:06.291 --> 19:07.917
And this is crossing it.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.500
So my son is not
getting a tattoo.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.792
Unless of course
you want a tattoo, son.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.542
No, I don't.
No, he doesn't
want a tattoo.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.917
Dude...

19:15.000 --> 19:17.375
Okay, start promoting my
restaurant, or get the hell out.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.500
JIMMY:
Chason!

19:20.583 --> 19:23.500
Chason, hey, at least say,
"I hate Jimmy's."

19:23.583 --> 19:24.875
We can edit
that out, right?

19:26.291 --> 19:27.250
Uh, Dad, if I may?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.333
Hey, Chason.

19:29.417 --> 19:30.750
You know, you may be
rich and famous,

19:30.834 --> 19:32.458
and millions of people
may love your music,

19:32.542 --> 19:34.542
but know this...

19:34.625 --> 19:36.583
it's not for me.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.667
There's that
honesty again.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.041
All right, maybe
I have gone soft,

19:44.125 --> 19:46.542
but, you know what,
maybe I'm okay with it.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.333
You figured that out now?

19:48.417 --> 19:50.333
I just watched
a 12-minute go-kart video.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.125
With no sound.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.125
Wait a minute, wait
a minute, I-I got it.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.208
@JimmyThe...

19:58.750 --> 20:00.667
Yeah.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.750
Take your time, I want mine
to look as good as hers.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.750
Henna.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.583
I don't think you
should have changed it.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.458
There's nothing wrong
with a bad tattoo.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.625
Eh, says the woman with a
tattoo on her hip that says...

20:10.709 --> 20:12.458
Buh, buh, buh.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.709
Who's Eddie?

20:14.792 --> 20:15.959
What do you mean,
who is Eddie?

20:16.041 --> 20:17.792
Oh!

20:17.875 --> 20:21.125
(laughs) You were always
a big Pearl Jam fan.

20:21.208 --> 20:22.500
I told you "Edie."

20:22.583 --> 20:24.542
Should have went
with a snake, man.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.208
Rookie.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.208
All right, from now on,
you're Eddie.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.208
Oh, she's passed out.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.041
Put a monkey on her forehead.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.250
(clicks tongue) No.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.709
<i>Time to go.</i>
