WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.476
PREPARE YOURSELVES, DINGOES!

00:08.509 --> 00:11.212
IT'S TIME FOR MY ANNUAL
FITNESS CHALLENGE WEEK!

00:11.245 --> 00:15.449
THIS YEAR, FORGET ABOUT
PUSH-UPS AND SIT-UPS.

00:15.483 --> 00:20.488
IT'S TIME FOR BRUISES,
SPRAINS, AND FREAK ACCIDENTS!

00:20.521 --> 00:22.490
I PRESENT

00:22.523 --> 00:26.026
THE DEATH SPIRAL SMACK DOWN!

00:32.232 --> 00:33.701
WELL, SAY WHAT YOU
WILL ABOUT HER,

00:33.734 --> 00:35.703
BUT SHE KNOWS HOW
TO BRING THE SIZZLE.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.739
WHY DO YOU CALL IT
THE DEATH SPIRAL?

00:38.772 --> 00:41.409
I MEAN... DOESN'T LOOK
SO SCARY TO ME.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.344
WHY DON'T I HAVE
VICE PRINCIPAL COCHRAN

00:43.377 --> 00:44.778
DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.318
( laughter )

01:00.060 --> 01:02.563
IT'S NOT BROKEN!
WALK IT OFF!

01:04.465 --> 01:06.600
S-SO HOW DOES IT WORK?

01:06.634 --> 01:09.637
YOU WRESTLE YOUR OPPONENT
AS IT SPINS YOU SILLY.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.539
IT'LL TEST YOUR STRENGTH,
REFLEXES,

01:11.572 --> 01:14.742
AND ABILITY TO HOLD
YOUR BLADDER AGAINST
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE!

01:14.775 --> 01:16.510
HA HA HA!

01:16.544 --> 01:19.180
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LEO?
CAN YOU HANDLE IT?

01:19.213 --> 01:22.550
WELL, MY BLADDER'S STRONG,
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE,

01:22.583 --> 01:25.653
I'M STICKING TO DARK
GYM SHORTS.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.689
I MYSELF WILL BE WEARING
A FULL-BODY DIAPER.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.759
IN THE FACE OF FEAR,
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA LEAK FROM.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.463
IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS,
PARTNER UP,

01:35.496 --> 01:37.298
AND CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.067
YOUR SURVIVAL DEPENDS
ON THE DECISION YOU MAKE,

01:40.100 --> 01:43.304
AND THERE ARE VERY
FEW GOOD OPTIONS!

01:43.337 --> 01:45.706
HA HA HA!

01:45.739 --> 01:48.609
WELL, LEO, EVERY YEAR
WE LOSE THE FITNESS CHALLENGE,

01:48.642 --> 01:50.611
BUT THIS YEAR,
WE'RE GONNA DO IT IN STYLE.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.613
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG, BUT...

01:52.646 --> 01:55.416
I TOTALLY EARNED
THE SEWING MERIT BADGE.

01:57.251 --> 02:01.655
LISTEN, GORDO,
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CAPE.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.858
I WANT TO BE A WINNER,
SO THIS YEAR,

02:04.892 --> 02:06.627
WE'RE GOING
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.628
YES.RE?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.632
BUT BY "WE," I MEAN NOT YOU.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.668
I'M GOING
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.537
OH. I SEE.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.672
THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE
MOST OF THE SCHOOL

02:18.706 --> 02:22.610
WOULD GIVE THEIR
RIGHT HAND TO BE
MY PARTNER.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.282
I'M SORRY, GORDO,
BUT WITH MY NEW PARTNER,

02:28.316 --> 02:29.750
I'M GONNA WIN THIS THING.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.252
( snarky chuckle )

02:31.285 --> 02:32.753
YOU'RE GONNA TRY THIS
AGAIN?

02:32.786 --> 02:34.388
LAST YEAR YOU THREW
YOUR BACK OUT

02:34.422 --> 02:35.623
PICKING YOUR WEDGIE!

02:35.656 --> 02:36.757
HA HA HA!

02:39.360 --> 02:40.761
WELL, THIS YEAR'S
GONNA BE DIFFERENT

02:40.794 --> 02:43.897
BECAUSE I HAVE
A SECRET WEAPON.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.833
OH, WHAT IS IT?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.401
YOU.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.571
AH, THAT IS A GOOD SECRET.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.707
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT IT!

02:53.741 --> 02:56.844
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.812
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.914
FASTER, SMARTER--

03:00.948 --> 03:03.817
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:03.851 --> 03:05.786
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:05.819 --> 03:09.323
**

03:14.462 --> 03:16.264
All: AAAAHHH!

03:43.757 --> 03:47.361
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY
IS THE BIG DEATH
SPIRAL SMACK DOWN.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.464
ME AND ADAM ARE GONNA
UNLEASH THE FURY!

03:52.366 --> 03:53.301
YOU GUYS GONNA COME WATCH?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.768
WE'D LOVE TO, BUT WE'RE
GONNA GO TO THE MALL

03:54.802 --> 03:56.337
AND CHECK OUT
THE ESCALATOR.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.506
I FINALLY MASTERED THE ART

03:58.539 --> 04:00.741
OF STEPPING OFF
WITHOUT TRIPPING.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.611
OOH, UM, WERE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT TODAY?

04:03.644 --> 04:04.945
SHOOT, I-I CAN'T MAKE IT.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.681
I HAVE A REALLY BIG
TEST TO STUDY FOR.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.849
WHAT?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.918
( sighs ) OKAY, FINE.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.786
I JUST HOPE THOSE OLD LADIES
ARE THERE AGAIN

04:12.820 --> 04:14.422
TO CLAP FOR ME.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.724
NEVER HAD
THIS CEREAL BEFORE.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.858
NO, LEO!

04:17.891 --> 04:19.892
THOSE ARE POWER PELLETS.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.529
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY'RE CALLED,

04:21.562 --> 04:23.731
AS LONG AS THEY MAKE
MY MILK CHOCOLATY.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.399
NO.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.401
THEY'RE BITE-SIZED PIECES
OF ADRENALIN

04:27.435 --> 04:28.536
THAT ACTIVATE OUR BIONICS.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.903
WE DON'T EAT THEM ANYMORE

04:29.937 --> 04:32.373
BECAUSE WE LEARNED HOW
TO ACTIVATE THEM OURSELVES.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.274
THEY TASTE LIKE DOG TREATS

04:34.308 --> 04:36.510
WITHOUT THE LIVERY AFTERTASTE.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.346
I'M GUESSING.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.782
I GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE THESE.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.817
CAREFUL, LEO!

04:43.851 --> 04:46.687
THOSE ARE POWDERED SUGAR
COOKIE DONUT O's.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.790
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
THEY SLOW DOWN
YOUR BRAIN ACTIVITY.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.860
( gasps ) YUMMY POWDERED
SUGAR COOKIE DONUT O's!

04:57.465 --> 04:58.799
SO, ADAM,

04:58.832 --> 05:00.901
HERE IS OUR SMACK DOWN
GAME PLAN.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.437
I WILL DISTRACT EVERYONE

05:03.471 --> 05:06.273
WHILE YOU USE YOUR BIONICS
TO CRUSH OUR OPPONENTS.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.042
I'M SORRY, LEO,
BIONICS ARE FOR MISSIONS.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.545
USING THEM FOR
A SCHOOL COMPETITION
WOULD JUST BE WRONG.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.880
BUT...

05:12.913 --> 05:14.748
YOU HA TO USE
YOUR BIONICS!

05:14.782 --> 05:16.784
IT'S THE WHOLE REASON
I CHOSE YOU!

05:16.817 --> 05:20.354
IT'S THE WEAPON PART
OF OUR SECRET WEAPON!

05:20.388 --> 05:21.522
OH, BUMMER!

05:21.555 --> 05:23.023
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA USE BIONICS,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.359
AND THEN YOU BLEW OFF
YOUR OLD BUDDY GORDO.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.461
COULDA HAD YOURSELF
A GREEN CAPE, DUDE.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.966
OH, ADAM, LET ME
HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.536
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE RUINING MY CEREAL!

05:35.569 --> 05:38.472
OH, AM I? LET'S--

05:38.506 --> 05:40.508
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT IS NOT MILK.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.609
HERE, LET ME FIX THAT.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.368
THERE YA' GO.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.039
THERE.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.074
EAT UP, TEAMMATE.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.976
I CAN'T EAT THIS!

06:16.977 --> 06:18.679
NOT WITHOUT A SPOON!

06:18.712 --> 06:19.813
OH, YEAH.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.789
( school bell rings )

06:28.822 --> 06:30.090
WHAT IS BREE
STILL DOING HERE?

06:30.123 --> 06:31.859
SHE SAID SHE HAD
TO STUDY FOR A TEST.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.429
YEAH, SHE'S NOT
STUDYING FOR A TEST.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.034
( whooshing sound )

06:41.068 --> 06:42.903
SO, BREE, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD GO TO THE PARK

06:42.936 --> 06:44.972
AND FISH SPARE CHANGE
OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.608
LAST WEEK, I MADE
A BUCK SEVENTY-THREE!

06:47.641 --> 06:50.077
WHATEVER WE DO,
I HAVE TO AVOID MY BROTHER.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.546
I TOTALLY DITCHED HIM
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS!

06:53.614 --> 06:55.483
SHE LIED TO ME!

06:55.516 --> 06:57.685
WOW. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OF TECHNOLOGY

06:57.718 --> 07:01.822
FOR YOU TO GET A TINY
GRASP OF THE OBVIOUS.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.958
SHE THINKS SHE
CAN JUST DITCH ME
AND GET AWAY WITH IT?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.561
OHH. SHE IS GOING DOWN.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.763
MR. DAVENPORT GAVE ME
AN OVERRIDE APP

07:09.797 --> 07:11.665
SO IN AN EMERGENCY
SITUATION,

07:11.699 --> 07:14.568
I CAN TAKE OVER ADAM
AND BREE'S BIONICS.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.970
( whirring sound )

07:17.004 --> 07:18.405
CONNECT TO BREE.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.541
( laughter )

07:26.013 --> 07:29.517
OW! OW! OW!
WHY AM I HITTING MYSELF?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.719
( lWHOA!er )

07:31.752 --> 07:33.787
TIME TO WAKE UP, BREE!
NOT SLEEPY ANYMORE!

07:33.821 --> 07:35.088
WAKE UP!

07:35.122 --> 07:37.658
I WAS FRIENDS WITH
A SELF-SLAPPER ONCE.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.192
I'M NOT GOING DOWN
THAT ROAD AGAIN!

07:39.226 --> 07:41.529
( laughter )

07:46.166 --> 07:48.168
MAN, THAT CEREAL'S
REALLY GOT ME GOING!

07:48.201 --> 07:49.937
I COULD BITE THE HEAD
OFF A GAZELLE!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.772
( comical growling )

07:51.805 --> 07:54.107
GREAT!
LET'S FOCUS THAT...

07:54.141 --> 07:56.677
DISTURBING ENERGY
ON WINNING!

07:58.111 --> 07:59.713
GREETINGS, LEO.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.816
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I ALSO FOUND
A SECRET WEAPON--

08:02.850 --> 08:04.051
A SECOND-YEAR SENIOR

08:04.084 --> 08:07.020
WHO WILL CONQUER YOU
AND YOUR FREAKISH TEAMMATE.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.155
WHO?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.991
I THINK HE'S TALKING
ABOUT THAT GUY.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.060
NERVOUS? I WOULD BE
IF I WERE YOU.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.663
THEY CALL HIM DESTRUCTO.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.097
I'M NOT NERVOUS.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.065
I HAVE HIM.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.735
YEAH. THEY CALL ME ADAM-O.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.106
MAN, I NEED A BETTER NAME.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.176
LISTEN UP, YOU FLABBY,
WEAK UNDERACHIEVERS!

08:29.209 --> 08:32.212
HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS--
TWO TEAMS FACE OFF.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.881
FIRST TEAM THROWN
OFF THE PLATFORM LOSES.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.085
SUDDEN DEATH--
NO SECOND CHANCES!

08:38.118 --> 08:39.886
SHORT KID AND DOOFUS,

08:39.919 --> 08:42.155
YOU'RE UP AGAINST
SPAGHETTI LEGS AND BOWL CUT!

08:42.188 --> 08:46.193
LET'S GET READY TO SPIRAL!

08:46.226 --> 08:49.229
( applause )

08:51.965 --> 08:53.934
STUPID THING'S BROKEN!

08:53.967 --> 08:55.168
( imitates air horn )

08:57.104 --> 08:59.072
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!

09:09.216 --> 09:11.719
LEO!

09:17.157 --> 09:20.861
WAY TO STICK THE LANDING!
HA HA! NEXT!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.796
WE WON!

09:22.830 --> 09:24.798
I AM THE DEATH SPIRAL
MASTER!

09:24.832 --> 09:27.067
RRRAAAAHHHH!

09:27.100 --> 09:29.670
HE IS THE DEATH SPIRAL
MASTER!

09:29.703 --> 09:31.772
WHOO!

09:32.840 --> 09:34.241
UH, HEY, GUYS.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.309
SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.
IT'S THIS NEW SCHOOL--

09:36.343 --> 09:38.178
IT'S GOT ME
ALL SLAP-HAPPY.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.246
( whirring sound )

09:39.279 --> 09:41.849
THAT'S OKAY. WE ALL
HAVE OUR MOMENTS.

09:41.882 --> 09:45.953
GREAT.
( speaking gibberish )

09:47.187 --> 09:49.289
BREE, YOU'RE HAVING
A LOT OF MOMENTS!

09:51.158 --> 09:54.094
NO, IT'S JUST, UM,
I SPEAK SWEDISH.

09:54.127 --> 09:58.298
( speaking Spanish )

09:58.331 --> 10:01.869
A-AND SPANISH.
( nervous chuckle )

10:01.902 --> 10:05.639
S'UP, LADIES?
HOW Y LIVIN'?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.310
( speaking Swedish )

10:10.343 --> 10:14.214
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE WASN'T THIS WEIRD LAST WEEK!

10:21.288 --> 10:23.757
YOU DID THIS TO ME.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.959
YOU'RE USING THAT STUPID
OVERRIDE APP.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.961
YEP, BECAUSE YOU LIED
TO ME.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.630
WELL, SINCE YOU USED
BIONICS ON ME,

10:30.664 --> 10:32.265
I'M GONNA USE MINE ON YOU.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.801
AND BEWARE.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.136
IT'S COMING WHEN YOU
LEAST EXPECT IT.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.238
OOH! THOSE ARE BIG WORDS
COMING FROM

10:38.271 --> 10:41.008
THE MANLY SPANISH-
SPEAKING SWEDE.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.948
COME ON! COME ON!

10:49.382 --> 10:52.052
YES! WHOO-HOO!

10:52.085 --> 10:53.821
IF THEY ASK
AT THE HOSPITAL,

10:53.854 --> 10:56.123
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN
ON SCHOOL GROUNDS!

10:57.390 --> 11:00.227
YOU JUST KEEP GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.329
I KNOW, AND I'M NOT
EVEN TRYING!

11:04.798 --> 11:08.802
ALL RIGHT, CHASE,
TIME FOR A LITTLE
BIONIC REVENGE.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.374
AAH! WHAT THE--?

11:16.209 --> 11:17.711
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!

11:19.212 --> 11:21.381
( laughter )

11:24.351 --> 11:25.786
( laughter )

11:25.819 --> 11:26.954
I WANT THAT TAIL!

11:26.987 --> 11:29.322
THIS IS IT--
THE FINAL SHOWDOWN.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.158
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D MAKE IT?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.326
A 90-POUNDER LIKE YOU
SHOULD HAVE EATEN IT
IN ROUND TWO.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.795
YEAH, TELL HIM!

11:34.828 --> 11:36.163
SHUT IT,
LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE!

11:37.297 --> 11:38.398
COME ON!

11:40.734 --> 11:41.869
( imitates air horn )

11:46.874 --> 11:48.141
SERIOUSLY?

11:50.343 --> 11:51.845
WILL!

12:04.224 --> 12:06.493
TELL MY MOM I LOVE HER!

12:08.095 --> 12:11.298
( spectators react )

12:11.331 --> 12:12.966
( celebrating )

12:13.000 --> 12:15.268
THAT'S IT? NO WAY!

12:15.302 --> 12:16.904
WE'RE TOO PUMPED FOR
THIS THING TO END!

12:16.937 --> 12:18.872
I WANT MORE! MORE! MORE!

12:18.906 --> 12:20.107
LEO!

12:23.310 --> 12:24.444
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ADAM?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.446
OH, HE'S JUST A WINNER,
LIKE ME.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.481
ME AND ADAM WINNERS.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.818
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.088
DID YOU GIVE HIM
POWER PELLETS?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.289
JUST ONE...

12:37.490 --> 12:38.959
BOWL.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.228
WHAT? TOO MANY
OF THOSE PELLETS

12:41.261 --> 12:42.863
WILL KEEP HIS
ADRENALINE GOING!

12:42.896 --> 12:46.366
IT'LL SNOWBALL,
AND HE WON'T BE ABLE
TO TURN HIS BIONICS OFF!

12:46.399 --> 12:48.335
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
WE WON!

12:48.368 --> 12:50.770
NOW, ON TO THE FINALS!

12:50.804 --> 12:52.139
THE WHAT?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.241
THERE CAN ONLY BE
ONE TRUE WINNER

12:54.274 --> 12:56.743
OF THE DEATH SPIRAL
SMACK DOWN,

12:56.776 --> 13:00.480
SO TOMORROW
WE GO MANO-A-MANO.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.882
GENTLEMAN,

13:01.915 --> 13:05.485
YOUR TEAMMATE
IS NOW YOUR ENEMY!

13:05.518 --> 13:08.488
I NEED TO GO
( AGAINST HIM?)

13:08.521 --> 13:12.025
RRRAAAAHHHH!

13:12.059 --> 13:15.262
YEP. SO YOU GO HOME
AND GET YOUR REST.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.364
I'M GONNA GO HOME
AND GET MY CAMERA.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.140
HEY, LEO, DO I SEEM
A LITTLE JITTERY TO YOU?

13:27.174 --> 13:30.010
HUH? DO I? ANSWER ME!

13:30.043 --> 13:32.880
WELL, JITTERY, NO.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.049
COMPLETELY MANIACAL
AND FULL OF RAGE, MAYBE.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.119
OH, I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.492
I'M HUNGRY! OH, I NEED
SOME MORE OF THAT YUMMY CEREAL.

13:45.525 --> 13:49.462
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.198
NO MORE CEREAL.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.233
WHY NOT?

13:53.266 --> 13:57.237
BECAUSE...
WE'RE OUT OF MILK.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.939
NO WE'RE NOT.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.174
IT'S RIGHT... HERE.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.213
OKAY. WE'RE OUT.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.988
HEY, IT'S THE LITTLE
DRUMMER BOY.

14:15.022 --> 14:19.059
IT'S ALL THAT WAS LEFT
IN THE LOST AND FOUND.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.127
AND THE HAT?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.229
IT'S PART OF THE ENSEMBLE.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.164
YOU CAN'T BREAK UP THE SET!

14:28.235 --> 14:30.603
COME ON, BREE,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

14:30.637 --> 14:32.339
I NEED TO GO AGAINST
ADAM TOMORROW,

14:32.372 --> 14:35.108
AND HE'S LIKE A BIG,
STRONG, GOOFY GODZILLA,

14:35.142 --> 14:36.376
AND I'M TOKYO!

14:36.409 --> 14:39.246
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
JUST QUIT!

14:39.279 --> 14:40.948
I CAN'T JUST QUIT.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.416
THE WHOLE SCHOOL
IS EXPECTING ME TO
TAKE ON ADAM TOMORROW,

14:43.450 --> 14:46.286
AND IF I QUIT,
I'LL JUST BE HUMILIATED.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.456
MORE HUMILIATED.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.026
IF I WANTED TO LOSE,
I COULD HAVE JUST

14:53.060 --> 14:54.627
STUCK WITH GORDO
AND KEPT A FRIEND.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.429
THE PELLETS WILL
WEAR OFF EVENTUALLY,

14:56.463 --> 14:58.498
BUT UNTIL THEY DO,
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM

14:58.531 --> 15:00.267
AND MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
DESTROY THE WHOLE HOUSE.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.506
CAN SOMEBODY HELP ME
PUT THIS BACK ON?

15:10.510 --> 15:13.346
WHOEVER CLAIMED
THE DRUM MAJOR UNIFORM

15:13.380 --> 15:15.615
YESTERDAY FROM
THE LOST AND FOUND,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.384
IT'S NOT YOURS!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.286
GIVE IT BACK!

15:26.926 --> 15:28.295
ALL THOSE CLOTHES,
AND YOU COULDN'T FIND

15:28.328 --> 15:31.331
SOMETHING
TO COVER YOUR FACE?

15:31.364 --> 15:34.501
GO AHEAD.
TRY TO HUMILIATE ME.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.270
I HAVE 36 ITEMS
OF CLOTHING ON.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.173
WHY WOULD I TRY?
YOU'RE HUMILIATING YOURSELF.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.009
YEAH? WELL,
THE TIN MAN CALLED.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.576
HE WANTS HIS NECK BACK.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.179
IT'S TO DEFLECT
YOUR STUPID APP

15:46.213 --> 15:47.647
FROM CONNECTING
TO MY CHIP.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.483
IT'S THE HEAVY DUTY KIND
THEY USE IN RESTAURANTS.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.253
( laughter )

15:54.954 --> 15:56.356
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.291
EVERYONE
THINKS WE'RE WEIRDOES.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.261
HEY, IT'S YOUR FAULT
FOR LYING AND DITCHING ME.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.064
I-I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.933
KATELYN'S THE FIRST REAL
FRIEND I'VE EVER HAD.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.301
JUST 'CAUSE I WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH HER

16:08.335 --> 16:10.570
DOESN'T MEAN I LIKE YOU
ANY LESS.

16:10.603 --> 16:15.042
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE
OTHER FRIENDS TOO NOW, SO...

16:15.075 --> 16:17.944
THAT'S GREAT. I MEAN,
YOU SHOULD GO HANG OUT
WITH THEM SOMETIMES.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.248
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY HAVE
OTHER FRIENDS.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.150
BUT I'M GONNA GO GET SOME.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.184
GOOD.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.119
OH, AND BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.987
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOSE
A LAYER OR TWO.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.491
YEAH, AND YOU
MIGHT WANT TO LOSE
THE BAKED POTATO NECK.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.128
SO, AS IT TURNS OUT,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.064
ADAM IS TOO SICK
TO COMPETE.

16:37.097 --> 16:41.234
SUCH A SHAME.
I GUESS THAT MEANS
I'M THE WINNER.

16:41.268 --> 16:45.138
"WINNER, PARTY OF LEO,
YOUR TROPHY'S READY."

16:45.172 --> 16:47.307
SICK? HE CAN'T BE SICK!

16:47.340 --> 16:49.109
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
TO ANNIHILATE YOU

16:49.142 --> 16:52.379
SO I CAN RUN YOU
UP THE FLAGPOLE
AND SALUTE FAILURE!

16:52.412 --> 16:57.484
ADAM IS SO SICK,
HE CAN... BARELY MOVE.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.294
HEY, WHAT GIVES?

17:09.162 --> 17:11.397
WHO LOCKED ME IN HERE?

17:11.431 --> 17:12.332
( gasps ) LEO!

17:16.636 --> 17:18.338
WHAT WAS HE THINKING?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.473
I COULDA MISSED
THE SMACK DOWN!

17:24.176 --> 17:28.648
IT PAINS ME DEEP TO MY CORE
TO SAY THIS,

17:28.681 --> 17:31.684
BUT THE WINNER
BY DEFAULT IS...

17:31.718 --> 17:33.353
( stammering )

17:33.386 --> 17:36.055
AHUH?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.590
SORRY I'M LATE,
PRINCIPAL PERRY.

17:37.624 --> 17:41.694
SOMEBODY LOCKED ME
IN MY CAP-- BEDROOM.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.297
BUT I JUST HAD
A GIGANTIC BOWL
OF MY FAVORITE CEREAL,

17:44.331 --> 17:47.300
SO NOW I'M READY
TO COMPETE, CRUSH,
AND DESTROY.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.602
THAT'S THE DINGO SPIRIT!

17:49.636 --> 17:51.271
BRING ON THE PAIN!

17:51.304 --> 17:53.173
WHOO!

17:53.206 --> 17:54.707
BUT WAIT, NO!

17:54.741 --> 17:56.209
WE'RE LIKE BROTHERS.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.810
OH. GOOD POINT.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.447
UM... WELL, THEN,
I GUESS I WILL CRUSH
AND DESTROY YOU

18:00.480 --> 18:03.550
AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE
WHILE STILL CRUSHING
AND DESTROYING YOU.

18:05.685 --> 18:09.389
I BOUGHT A NEW ONE! HA!

18:09.422 --> 18:12.058
( cheers and applause )

18:12.091 --> 18:14.561

18:39.452 --> 18:41.388

18:41.421 --> 18:42.722
HEY!

18:42.755 --> 18:44.157
YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

18:45.892 --> 18:47.360

18:47.394 --> 18:49.496

19:05.878 --> 19:08.248
HE'S GONNA TURN

WRECKING BALL

19:08.281 --> 19:10.417
IF WE DON'T STOP HIM

19:38.678 --> 19:42.415
I... DON'T... KNOW...

AAAHHHH!

19:46.486 --> 19:48.755

19:48.788 --> 19:52.725
( cheers and applause )

19:52.759 --> 19:55.328
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:55.362 --> 19:57.330
LIFE WAS SO MUCH
MORE GRATIFYING

19:57.364 --> 19:58.898
WHEN I WAS
A PRISON GUARD!

20:00.767 --> 20:01.901
HERE.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.338
( mockingly )
CON-GRAT-U-LA-TIONS.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.442
WAY TO GO, LEO.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.611
I WAS SECRETLY ROOTING
FOR YOU TO WIN.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.612
YOU WERE NOT.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.780
SURE I WAS.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.948
I EVEN SEWED YOU
THIS VICTORY CAKE

20:15.982 --> 20:17.817
BECAUSE WHEN
ONE LOSER WINS,

20:17.850 --> 20:20.487
WE ALL GET BUMPED
UP A NOTCH.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.621
OH.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.323
OH, RIGHT. EXACTLY.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.791
THAT'S WHY I DID IT.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.560
I MEAN, I HAD YOU
IN MIND THE WHOLE TIME.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.462
( cOW!g )

20:29.496 --> 20:32.265
WATCH IT! THAT'S
MY SEWING HAND!

20:34.367 --> 20:37.337
HEY, CHASE TOLD ME
ABOUT THE POWER PELLETS!

20:37.370 --> 20:39.606

20:39.639 --> 20:41.608
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME, LEO.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.277
I'M SORRY. I JUST--
I REALLY WANTED TO WIN.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.413
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO HURT OUR FRIENDSHIP.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.248
YEAH, WELL, IT DID,
AND NOTHING'S GOING
TO FIX IT.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.584
YOU CAN HAVE MY
VICTORY CAPE.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.486
BUDDY!

20:53.520 --> 20:54.654
OOH!

20:54.687 --> 20:57.524
( imitates airplane engine )

20:59.959 --> 21:02.429
WAIT. SO YOU CAN
CONTROL WHAT I DO
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.631
THE OVERRIDE APP
IS PRETTY COOL, HUH?

21:04.664 --> 21:09.536
SO YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S
BEEN MAKING ME DO STUPID
STUFF ALL THESE YEARS.

21:09.569 --> 21:12.305
NO, THAT'S ALL YOU.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.440
DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.708
I HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME
CONTROLLING MYSELF.

21:15.742 --> 21:20.513
OKAY, BUT...
THAT MEANS I CAN'T
EVER DO THIS.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.615
CONNECT TO ADAM.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.917
( whirring
and plinking sounds )

21:24.951 --> 21:26.853
OOH! MAKE ME DO
THE CHICKEN DANCE!

21:35.862 --> 21:37.464
ADAM, I DISCONNECTED.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.065
I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST
TOO MUCH FUN!
