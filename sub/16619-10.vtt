WEBVTT

00:00.776 --> 00:03.858
- Previously on "Quantico"...
- We believe Owen Hall,

00:03.860 --> 00:06.444
the head instructor, is the recruiter.

00:06.446 --> 00:09.177
Everything you'll learn
is a capital offense.

00:10.022 --> 00:11.537
Something doesn't add up.

00:11.539 --> 00:12.780
Something about you.

00:12.782 --> 00:14.115
I'm not coming back, Miranda.

00:14.117 --> 00:15.616
I'm gonna stay here at The Farm,

00:15.618 --> 00:18.252
find the AIC, and take them down myself.

00:18.288 --> 00:20.321
No one suspects you're a double agent?

00:20.323 --> 00:21.589
- Nope.
- Good.

00:21.591 --> 00:23.491
They chose me, Alex, not you.

00:23.493 --> 00:24.858
It's over.

00:24.860 --> 00:26.426
That's what I wanted you to believe.

00:26.428 --> 00:28.295
President Todd will hand over power

00:28.297 --> 00:30.130
to Vice President Claire Haas.

00:30.132 --> 00:32.833
I wasn't wrong about
your broken heart. Lydia?

00:32.835 --> 00:35.453
I let my career get in the
way of our relationship.

00:35.478 --> 00:38.368
_

00:38.393 --> 00:39.483
_

00:39.508 --> 00:40.618
I am one of the terrorists.

00:40.643 --> 00:43.042
And after the conversation
that we are about to have,

00:43.044 --> 00:44.153
you will be, too.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.814
This is where we're headed.

00:47.816 --> 00:50.117
You're telling me there's been
a way inside the crisis zone

00:50.119 --> 00:52.352
this whole time, and no one's found it?

00:52.354 --> 00:55.155
Last week, Eric Boyer
edited a service tunnel

00:55.157 --> 00:56.723
out of every digital map in this city

00:56.725 --> 00:58.725
in case they needed a way out.

00:58.727 --> 01:00.893
You say "they" as if
you're not a part of them.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.663
You went inside The Farm to
stop a group of insurgents

01:03.665 --> 01:05.832
inside the CIA, and you failed.

01:05.834 --> 01:09.135
Someone noticed, and they contacted me.

01:09.137 --> 01:09.869
Ryan.

01:09.871 --> 01:10.903
Someone else.

01:10.905 --> 01:14.040
Someone who knew how
ruinous this group could be

01:14.042 --> 01:17.809
to the very foundation of
this country, to the world.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.147
They knew what it took to stop them.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.881
We knew lines had to be crossed.

01:22.883 --> 01:27.586
You have betrayed every oath
that you have ever taken.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.920
Once all this is over,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.389
you're gonna pay for
everything you've done.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.824
Everyone will, Alex.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.660
Including you.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.305
_

01:37.330 --> 01:38.830
I've done some digging,

01:38.832 --> 01:41.033
and this group appears
to be very, very real.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.834
And what did you find out?

01:42.836 --> 01:45.837
No specifics I'd like
to share with AT&T.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.873
Let's just say the AIC
appear to be the answer

01:47.875 --> 01:49.379
to a lot of unsolved questions

01:49.404 --> 01:51.176
the home office has
had the past few months.

01:51.178 --> 01:54.845
Okay. Well, how should I proceed?

01:54.847 --> 01:57.182
I thought you had someone on the inside,

01:57.184 --> 02:00.285
but your work with Alex Parrish
seems to be going nowhere.

02:00.287 --> 02:04.021
I think I've been backing
the wrong horse up to now.

02:04.023 --> 02:07.391
Then change horses.

02:07.393 --> 02:10.061
Thank you, as ever, for
your encouraging words.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.862
Next year you can come with us.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.898
You'll see how much joy there is

02:13.900 --> 02:15.766
building these shelters for these kids,

02:15.768 --> 02:17.125
working with their churches.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.903
You don't have to leave already, do you?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.204
You are the one who has to drive

02:20.206 --> 02:22.239
two and a half hours after breakfast.

02:22.241 --> 02:23.973
I can be late.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.084
You cook, too?

02:34.086 --> 02:36.486
Well, I've spent a lot of time alone.

02:36.488 --> 02:38.822
Consider this the last
piece to my apology.

02:38.824 --> 02:41.925
Whatever did you do so I
could deserve all of this?

02:44.963 --> 02:46.662
Why don't you go take a shower?

02:46.664 --> 02:48.397
I'll plate this.

02:48.399 --> 02:50.366
Okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.495 --> 03:20.362
Hey.

03:21.598 --> 03:23.498
We need to talk about the other night.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.699
Yeah, I figured this was bigger

03:24.701 --> 03:27.935
than a "run the bathroom
sink or blender" conversation.

03:27.937 --> 03:30.538
I need to know what you're
gonna do with your phone.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.206
You know that's none of your business.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.166
Maybe not mine, but I'm on my way

03:34.191 --> 03:35.393
to a safe house somewhere,

03:35.418 --> 03:37.011
full of people who will make it theirs.

03:37.013 --> 03:38.380
Has yours even rung yet?

03:38.382 --> 03:39.947
Yours hasn't?

03:42.452 --> 03:43.718
I'm sorry. Look.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.288
Separating our work and our
relationship is getting harder.

03:47.290 --> 03:49.023
The mission will end.

03:49.025 --> 03:51.058
Being at The Farm will end.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.459
We won't.

03:52.461 --> 03:54.228
No matter what's happening,

03:54.230 --> 03:57.398
that doesn't change how
we feel about each other.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.167
Not yet.

04:02.871 --> 04:04.405
Oh-ho-ho!

04:04.407 --> 04:05.572
Please, go ahead.

04:05.574 --> 04:07.007
No, no, you go first.

04:07.009 --> 04:08.909
How about I just see you back there?

04:08.911 --> 04:10.043
Yeah, okay.

04:10.045 --> 04:11.178
I'll, uh...

04:11.180 --> 04:11.878
I'll go west.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.014
- Yep.
- Yep.

04:22.057 --> 04:23.589
Clever girl.

04:29.865 --> 04:31.231
Is this made by StarTAC?

04:31.233 --> 04:32.833
Do you get free rollover minutes?

04:32.835 --> 04:33.999
What are you doing? Put that back.

04:34.001 --> 04:34.967
What, back in your pocket?

04:34.969 --> 04:36.703
Where it's been through
every conversation

04:36.705 --> 04:37.903
we've had this last week?

04:37.905 --> 04:40.039
Oh, two weeks? Oh.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.941
And there I was thinking
you needed my help,

04:41.943 --> 04:45.044
but you've just played me
like you've been playing him.

04:45.046 --> 04:46.546
I've been there before.

04:46.548 --> 04:48.348
What are you, spying on us?

04:48.350 --> 04:50.515
This should not be your concern, Harry.

04:50.517 --> 04:52.451
You should be tracking Owen's movements.

04:52.453 --> 04:54.086
Yeah, well, he hasn't been
anywhere besides class,

04:54.088 --> 04:56.121
the Gold Leaf, and home this last week.

04:56.123 --> 04:58.057
The radioactive isotope we've put in him

04:58.059 --> 05:00.059
has since worn off, and
we are none the wiser.

05:00.061 --> 05:01.961
But not that any of that matters,

05:01.963 --> 05:05.364
because you've had what
we've needed this whole time.

05:05.366 --> 05:07.232
You know, you had in me, unlike Ryan,

05:07.234 --> 05:09.468
someone you could trust
who's on your side...

05:09.470 --> 05:11.636
Or was, rather.

05:11.638 --> 05:13.405
Because

05:13.407 --> 05:15.807
I think I've just found me a new ride.

05:15.809 --> 05:18.943
Wait.

05:18.945 --> 05:19.711
Don't.

05:19.713 --> 05:20.945
Don't what?

05:20.947 --> 05:22.834
What are you gonna do, phone a friend?

05:22.859 --> 05:24.082
How are you gonna do that, Alex?

05:25.886 --> 05:29.420
"Operating an asset" means
giving someone a reason

05:29.422 --> 05:30.989
to do what you want them to do.

05:30.991 --> 05:32.123
Which is?

05:32.125 --> 05:33.091
Spy for you.

05:33.093 --> 05:34.592
Goes without saying.

05:34.594 --> 05:35.393
What else?

05:35.395 --> 05:37.896
Provide intelligence or secrets.

05:37.898 --> 05:38.729
Getting warmer.

05:38.731 --> 05:39.597
Change sides?

05:39.599 --> 05:41.766
Betray their country?

05:41.768 --> 05:44.134
Betray their loved ones?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.403
Betray themselves.

05:45.405 --> 05:46.837
Correct, all of you.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.606
But there are many layers
to operating an asset,

05:48.608 --> 05:51.108
and it all starts with leverage.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.176
In our game, there are
four points of leverage...

05:53.178 --> 05:57.580
Money, ideology, coercion, and ego.

05:57.582 --> 05:59.316
We call this "MICE."

05:59.318 --> 06:01.451
But in my experience, I
like to add another letter...

06:01.453 --> 06:04.121
"D," for "doubt."

06:04.123 --> 06:05.923
If you can give your
asset a reason to doubt...

06:05.925 --> 06:08.691
Doubt who they can trust,
what they believe in,

06:08.693 --> 06:10.460
how they're perceived...
Then you have found

06:10.462 --> 06:12.629
their largest point of leverage.

06:12.631 --> 06:14.597
But seeding doubt takes time.

06:14.599 --> 06:16.699
You have to do the research,
find the pressure points,

06:16.701 --> 06:19.001
get your leverage... Which
is what you'll be doing

06:19.003 --> 06:20.970
for the next few hours.

06:20.972 --> 06:25.074
But doubt not, your
patience will be rewarded.

06:33.985 --> 06:34.984
What's up?

06:34.986 --> 06:36.518
I have orders from Miranda,

06:36.520 --> 06:39.621
and you're not going to like them.

06:39.623 --> 06:41.290
Ooh, hot.

06:41.292 --> 06:43.159
I didn't know you were
into this sort of thing.

06:43.161 --> 06:44.693
Let's be honest, I'm not surprised.

06:44.695 --> 06:45.727
I want my phone back, Harry.

06:45.729 --> 06:46.862
But you've already got one.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.798
I've seen you 'Gram all those
inspirational quotes with it.

06:50.734 --> 06:51.967
You're not leaving.

06:51.969 --> 06:52.901
This ends now.

06:52.903 --> 06:53.535
What does?

06:53.537 --> 06:55.070
Alex's time at The Farm.

06:55.072 --> 06:56.137
We gave you the benefit of the doubt

06:56.139 --> 06:59.407
that wouldn't stand in
the way, but that's over.

06:59.409 --> 07:01.176
They recruited me.

07:01.178 --> 07:02.344
Did they?

07:02.346 --> 07:04.745
Because this phone has only
received two phone calls,

07:04.747 --> 07:06.247
and neither of them were answered.

07:06.249 --> 07:08.383
If I didn't know you better, Alex,

07:08.385 --> 07:11.052
I would say you mocked this up yourself.

07:11.054 --> 07:11.987
What do you want?

07:11.989 --> 07:14.222
I want to know every
single thing you know

07:14.224 --> 07:15.090
and when you know it.

07:15.092 --> 07:16.424
Or I can go to Ryan

07:16.426 --> 07:19.426
and combine the powers
of the FBI and MI6.

07:19.428 --> 07:20.695
You wouldn't do that.

07:20.697 --> 07:21.696
Wouldn't I?

07:21.698 --> 07:23.698
You've already told your
boyfriend you have this,

07:23.700 --> 07:26.501
which means your former
employers now know,

07:26.503 --> 07:28.035
and their next move is to eliminate

07:28.037 --> 07:29.403
any threat to their mission.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.572
She's not FBI anymore.

07:31.574 --> 07:33.173
She could compromise your mission.

07:33.175 --> 07:35.209
I won't sabotage Alex.

07:35.211 --> 07:37.077
One way or another,

07:37.079 --> 07:38.412
she'll be done.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.880
Better it be you.

07:39.882 --> 07:43.850
You eliminate Ryan,
and then we can talk.

07:43.852 --> 07:45.419
In the meantime, I will just stand back

07:45.421 --> 07:47.187
and see whether

07:47.189 --> 07:49.456
Mr. or Mrs. Smith survives.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.191
But a word of advice.

07:51.193 --> 07:54.561
Take Ryan out before he takes you out.

07:54.563 --> 07:56.029
Better you...

07:56.031 --> 07:58.632
...than him.

08:02.971 --> 08:05.104
We're against the clock, Miranda.

08:05.106 --> 08:07.240
President Haas is
ordering an air strike.

08:07.242 --> 08:09.742
- What are we doing waiting here?
- You wanted to save lives, right?

08:09.744 --> 08:11.810
How about we start with 121 souls

08:11.812 --> 08:14.647
who don't know an air
strike is coming their way?

08:14.649 --> 08:17.116
I never said redemption came easy.

08:17.118 --> 08:18.584
Come on.

08:18.586 --> 08:21.087
Come on!

08:21.089 --> 08:23.222
No sign of Director
Shaw or Alex Parrish.

08:23.224 --> 08:24.123
Keep looking.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.625
Let me know the moment
you find anything.

08:26.627 --> 08:30.095
All personnel must
clear out immediately.

08:30.097 --> 08:32.164
Remain in your office, Agent Wyatt.

08:32.166 --> 08:35.500
The worst crisis since
Grand Central in unfolding

08:35.501 --> 08:37.402
in lower Manhattan, and
you just kicked the FBI

08:37.404 --> 08:38.336
out of their offices?

08:38.337 --> 08:40.105
It's a big building.

08:40.107 --> 08:42.640
They'll find a place to work.

08:42.642 --> 08:43.775
Madame President.

08:43.777 --> 08:45.444
We need to talk.

08:47.572 --> 08:51.736
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

08:52.535 --> 08:54.769
I guess congratulations are in order.

08:54.794 --> 08:56.377
The first lady's been murdered.

08:56.379 --> 08:57.845
Downtown Manhattan is under siege.

08:57.847 --> 08:59.814
There's not cause for congratulations.

08:59.816 --> 09:01.015
Why not?

09:01.017 --> 09:02.950
You got the job you always wanted.

09:02.952 --> 09:05.820
I see this isn't going to
be a friendly conversation.

09:05.822 --> 09:07.021
Why should it be?

09:07.023 --> 09:09.556
You could've ordered the
strike from the Situation Room,

09:09.558 --> 09:13.327
but you sent General Richards
down here to do your dirty work.

09:13.329 --> 09:14.862
Why show yourself now?

09:14.864 --> 09:16.730
Or did you just want to see my face

09:16.732 --> 09:18.732
when you kill my friends?

09:18.734 --> 09:20.667
In the brief time that
I've been president,

09:20.669 --> 09:22.736
I've been surrounded by
experts who don't think

09:22.738 --> 09:23.970
I'm equipped for the job.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.405
Are you?

09:27.543 --> 09:28.675
You see that office?

09:28.677 --> 09:30.043
It used to be Greg Lawson's.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.745
We trained together at Quantico.

09:31.747 --> 09:34.047
He was one of the guys I came up with.

09:34.049 --> 09:37.083
But I was never one of them.

09:37.085 --> 09:38.551
I could pretend to be like them.

09:38.553 --> 09:41.020
I could do the job better,
I could get the promotions,

09:41.022 --> 09:42.488
but at the end of the
day, I look like I looked

09:42.490 --> 09:44.657
and I was what I was.

09:44.659 --> 09:46.826
Men don't like to admit
that glass ceilings exist

09:46.828 --> 09:49.061
because they are the glass ceiling.

09:49.063 --> 09:51.196
Well, you just shattered it.

09:51.198 --> 09:52.832
Only be default.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.000
It's not getting the job
that's gonna change the way

09:55.002 --> 09:56.836
Americans feel about women.

09:56.838 --> 09:58.437
It's what I do with it.

09:58.439 --> 10:01.106
If I listen to the
people around me now...

10:01.108 --> 10:02.775
People I did not choose...

10:02.777 --> 10:05.610
Then I might be able to stay president.

10:05.612 --> 10:07.045
But those people want to strike,

10:07.047 --> 10:09.381
and they say if I don't,
I'll be perceived as weak.

10:09.383 --> 10:12.784
I didn't plan or approve
this, and I still don't.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.619
There is a better way.

10:14.621 --> 10:16.088
And that's why I'm here.

10:16.090 --> 10:18.223
I need your help

10:18.225 --> 10:20.725
to call off the strike.

10:20.727 --> 10:22.794
You're the commander in chief.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.362
You just say "no."

10:24.364 --> 10:27.932
I can't...

10:27.934 --> 10:31.699
because I helped create the
rogue group inside the CIA.

10:33.407 --> 10:35.973
The act of betraying
someone, or something,

10:35.975 --> 10:37.442
isn't easy.

10:37.444 --> 10:40.912
And the target we've chosen
for you isn't, either.

10:40.914 --> 10:43.981
Meet Gabriel Carrera...
A squeaky-clean,

10:43.983 --> 10:46.583
high-ranking officer at
the Venezuelan Consulate

10:46.585 --> 10:48.752
whom the CIA would like
to use to gain access

10:48.754 --> 10:51.122
to some of Venezuela's state secrets.

10:51.124 --> 10:52.890
Now, you've already cased his house,

10:52.892 --> 10:55.058
got his phone logs
and his banks records,

10:55.060 --> 10:56.493
and even obtained his garbage...

10:56.495 --> 10:58.762
Thank you, Mr. Chen...
All for one reason...

10:58.764 --> 11:00.731
Finding out what makes him tick.

11:00.733 --> 11:03.233
Intel has told us certain
Venezuelan government officials

11:03.235 --> 11:05.235
may be embezzling money
from their homeland.

11:05.237 --> 11:08.772
Carrera has access to
classified financial records.

11:08.774 --> 11:10.808
Obtaining this information
will allow the agency to

11:10.810 --> 11:13.810
have leverage in Venezuela
during its expected collapse.

11:13.812 --> 11:14.978
Now, we've already gathered

11:14.980 --> 11:17.080
an array of intelligence on Carrera.

11:17.082 --> 11:20.183
Your job is to learn
all you can about him

11:20.185 --> 11:23.753
and figure out how best to
turn him against his country.

11:24.722 --> 11:28.257
Vaulted ceilings,
skylights, new appliances,

11:28.259 --> 11:29.792
all on a government salary?

11:29.794 --> 11:32.662
Well, maybe he's got a
sugar daddy or a rich uncle.

11:32.664 --> 11:36.265
Either way, need for
money will not turn him.

11:36.267 --> 11:40.202
Gabriel, his daughter,
and his husband, Robbie.

11:40.204 --> 11:41.170
Well done, Gabriel.

11:41.172 --> 11:43.105
Worked out pretty well for Robbie, too.

11:43.107 --> 11:44.840
Gabriel got him a job at the Consulate.

11:44.842 --> 11:46.041
How's it going with Ryan?

11:46.043 --> 11:48.844
Have you worked out how to
clear that playing field yet?

11:48.846 --> 11:50.446
I'm not going after him.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.547
I have my mission, he has his.

11:52.549 --> 11:57.052
Oh. Just so you know, this
has rung a few more times.

11:57.054 --> 11:59.688
Wonder what they'll do if they
think you're ignoring them.

11:59.690 --> 12:02.023
Living and working together.

12:02.025 --> 12:06.194
Sounds like my personal
nightmare... no space.

12:06.196 --> 12:08.530
Didn't figure you for
someone who had relationships.

12:08.532 --> 12:10.899
Didn't figure you for one, either.

12:10.901 --> 12:14.068
Relationships make for weak operatives.

12:14.070 --> 12:16.838
- Owen?
- Yeah?

12:20.074 --> 12:21.909
Something I can help you with?

12:21.911 --> 12:24.512
You know what? I just figured it out.

12:24.514 --> 12:25.346
Thanks.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.417
See, I can understand falling into debt

12:29.419 --> 12:32.020
for a really beautiful Tom Ford tuxedo,

12:32.022 --> 12:34.443
but all these Bonobos?

12:34.468 --> 12:35.589
Are we sure they're gay?

12:35.591 --> 12:38.325
You do realize that I don't find you

12:38.327 --> 12:40.761
as charming as everyone
else here does, right?

12:40.763 --> 12:42.696
But you might find me useful.

12:42.698 --> 12:45.032
Your girlfriend is trying to
get you bounced out of training

12:45.034 --> 12:47.568
so she can have the AIC all to herself.

12:47.570 --> 12:49.269
And why would I believe a word you said?

12:49.271 --> 12:52.072
Well, because we're both real
agents who swore under oath

12:52.074 --> 12:54.174
to uphold the law, and
your fiancé over there

12:54.176 --> 12:56.209
is just some disgruntled ex-employee

12:56.211 --> 12:58.345
that HR hasn't gotten around to yet.

12:58.347 --> 13:02.215
You see, I back winners, Ryan.

13:02.217 --> 13:05.618
If you want to turn the
tables and get the upper hand,

13:05.620 --> 13:08.220
I am willing to help.

13:08.222 --> 13:11.090
Well, I might just take
you up on that offer.

13:11.092 --> 13:13.092
That's very good to hear.

13:16.765 --> 13:19.398
Money seems to be the
best point of leverage.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.533
Maybe we can bribe him.

13:20.535 --> 13:22.869
Or we use doubt to turn him.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.756
Maybe he resents the
lifestyle he has to maintain

13:24.780 --> 13:25.846
to keep his husband.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.940
We could make it seem like
Robbie's having an affair?

13:27.942 --> 13:29.408
Get him in a vulnerable place.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.033
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

13:31.035 --> 13:32.945
You call fidelity and trust into issue,

13:32.947 --> 13:34.478
everything starts to unravel.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.482
You're assuming there
isn't strong trust there.

13:36.484 --> 13:37.649
What about the kid?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.085
Gabriel is the biological father.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.055
Venezuela doesn't
support marriage equality

13:43.057 --> 13:44.155
or LGBT adoption.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.959
If we cause concern over custody,

13:46.961 --> 13:50.228
we have a true pressure
point to exploit.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.597
What do you think is best?

13:51.599 --> 13:53.298
You tell me.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.467
You're heading to the
Venezuelan Consulate in one hour.

13:55.469 --> 13:58.236
Your goal... plant enough
doubt in Gabriel Carrera's mind

13:58.238 --> 13:59.471
to get him to give us access

13:59.473 --> 14:01.839
to those confidential financial records.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.341
Work as a team.

14:03.343 --> 14:07.178
And remember, a Consulate
is technically foreign soil.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.513
There is no "get out of jail free" card

14:08.515 --> 14:09.847
from your Uncle Sam if you get caught.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.250
You blow your cover,
it'll be a long time

14:12.252 --> 14:14.184
before you see the outside
of a Venezuelan prison.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.621
We could destroy an entire relationship

14:16.623 --> 14:18.288
with the information we've collected.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.924
A family.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.525
How far do you want us to go?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.694
As far as it takes.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.501
Well, I might just take
you up on that offer.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.169
You told him I was
going after him first.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.303
You lied.

14:33.305 --> 14:36.840
Oh, please, I barely tipped
the glass before he spilled.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.255
He's coming for you, Alex.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.344
Harry, please. You're playing us both.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.245
Maybe.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.614
It's not a race with just one person.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.316
Look, all that matter
is, Ryan in an FBI agent

14:47.318 --> 14:49.285
with legitimate
government business here.

14:49.287 --> 14:50.820
You are just holding a grudge.

14:50.822 --> 14:53.389
He will betray you...

14:53.391 --> 14:55.491
Maybe today, maybe next week.

14:55.493 --> 15:00.130
But if you want to stay
here, you need to do it first.

15:07.405 --> 15:09.639
So, what, are we
supposed to just rush in,

15:09.641 --> 15:12.241
get everyone out...
hostage, terrorists alike...

15:12.243 --> 15:13.108
Before the strike?

15:13.110 --> 15:14.677
That's a tall order for two people.

15:14.679 --> 15:17.713
A little less tall for three.

15:17.715 --> 15:21.316
Alex, I just need you to know...
Ryan is not a part of this.

15:21.318 --> 15:23.218
I told him everything that was going on,

15:23.220 --> 15:26.321
and he made me promise to
help him get you out to safety.

15:32.884 --> 15:34.817
We can catch up on the
way. Come on, let's go.

15:34.842 --> 15:38.710
Nobody's going anywhere...
Especially you, Miranda.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.034
It was my first term as senator.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.381
I was eager to reach across the aisle.

15:46.383 --> 15:49.417
I would talk to anyone
who had a good idea.

15:49.419 --> 15:52.020
And then one night, I
found myself sitting across

15:52.022 --> 15:54.221
from someone from DOD who revealed,

15:54.223 --> 15:56.123
after several bottles of wine,

15:56.125 --> 15:58.258
that he was in charge
of the Black Budget.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.694
The federal-intelligence budget?

16:00.696 --> 16:02.630
That is code-word classified.

16:02.632 --> 16:05.766
It is, but he was drinking,
and I was fascinated.

16:05.768 --> 16:08.101
There is was in front of me...

16:08.103 --> 16:10.637
An accounting of everything
we spend on surveillance,

16:10.639 --> 16:12.406
foreign operations, assassinations,

16:12.408 --> 16:14.207
arming rebels,

16:14.209 --> 16:16.310
rigging elections in other countries.

16:16.312 --> 16:18.778
I mean, if you want to know what
a country's priorities are...

16:18.780 --> 16:20.147
- you follow...
- You follow the money.

16:20.149 --> 16:21.714
That's right.

16:21.716 --> 16:24.384
This country needs
black ops, that's a fact.

16:24.386 --> 16:26.486
But he said that he
wanted to help facilitate

16:26.488 --> 16:29.155
more transparency, more
accountability, as did I.

16:29.157 --> 16:31.257
I campaigned on it.

16:31.259 --> 16:32.759
I was proud to help.

16:32.761 --> 16:35.227
We passed a bill that called
for independent oversight

16:35.229 --> 16:38.832
of the black ops, with 10%
going towards something called

16:38.834 --> 16:41.300
"alternative training,"
which was supposed to mean

16:41.302 --> 16:42.936
new practices.

16:42.938 --> 16:45.438
Instead, it meant the
formation of the group

16:45.440 --> 16:47.606
you've dubbed the AIC
in your white paper.

16:47.608 --> 16:50.242
Once you knew, you
could have come forward,

16:50.244 --> 16:52.011
done something to stop them.

16:52.013 --> 16:54.580
I didn't know they
existed until your report

16:54.582 --> 16:56.983
came across my desk five hours ago.

16:56.985 --> 16:58.784
I need you to disavow that paper.

16:58.786 --> 17:01.319
I get it. I get it.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.522
If you call off the strike
and the white paper comes out,

17:04.525 --> 17:06.458
it'll look like you helped the AIC.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.862
But that is not the case, and
you can defend your actions.

17:09.864 --> 17:11.296
You just did.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.665
Why are you making this a negotiation?

17:13.666 --> 17:16.001
What is the point of a
woman even being elected

17:16.002 --> 17:18.269
if she's just gonna act
like every man before her?

17:18.271 --> 17:20.838
Why can't you just do the right thing?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.173
Because I wasn't elected.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.309
America elected a
half-as-qualified man

17:24.310 --> 17:25.609
with next to no experience.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.454
A man who's never stood for anything,

17:27.479 --> 17:29.981
who never served this country,
and who rolled over out of fear

17:29.983 --> 17:32.017
when a terrorist demanded it.

17:32.019 --> 17:33.618
He's gone now, and I'm here,

17:33.620 --> 17:35.219
and we both want the same things.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.121
Let's start with that.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.395
The Joint Chiefs want an update.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.130
They work for you.

17:46.132 --> 17:48.799
I'll be sure to remind them of that.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.204
Hey. How are you?

17:54.206 --> 17:56.240
My wife and I are here
for our visa application.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.674
This won't take too long, is it?

17:57.676 --> 17:59.410
'Cause our sitter has to leave at 6:00.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.879
Okay. Have a seat.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.749
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.716
We're in.

18:06.718 --> 18:07.918
Well, you can sit tight.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.019
We got this.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.054
This isn't a solo mission.

18:11.056 --> 18:12.355
I thought they all were.

18:12.357 --> 18:14.357
Gentlemen, please.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.225
Mr. Carrera, I'm glad
you could meet with us

18:16.227 --> 18:17.661
on such short notice.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.395
Two important men want to bring

18:19.397 --> 18:21.898
much-needed investment capital
to the people of Venezuela.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.100
How can I say "no" to that?

18:24.102 --> 18:28.571
So, what's your play with Ryan?

18:28.573 --> 18:30.106
No play, really.

18:30.108 --> 18:33.409
Just a shot across the
bow to see if you're right.

18:33.411 --> 18:35.511
As you can see, our
firm is well-capitalized

18:35.513 --> 18:37.613
and prepared to meet whatever
requirements there are

18:37.615 --> 18:39.782
to start our business in
your country immediately.

18:39.784 --> 18:43.351
Including paying any
special fees, let's say.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.387
I'm listening.

18:45.389 --> 18:47.623
We have money... A lot of it.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.224
And we're willing to spend it in any way

18:49.226 --> 18:50.693
that makes our lives easier,

18:50.695 --> 18:54.563
including lining the
right pockets in Caracas.

18:54.565 --> 18:57.532
I was just waiting to
hear what your goal was.

18:57.534 --> 19:00.735
Even if I had that information,
I wouldn't share it with two men

19:00.737 --> 19:03.472
who represent a firm that doesn't exist.

19:03.474 --> 19:08.210
You were incorporated last
week, and you have no investors.

19:08.212 --> 19:10.579
What is this? Money
laundering? Pay-to-play?

19:10.581 --> 19:11.980
I don't care to find out.

19:11.982 --> 19:16.417
Leave now, before I have
you forcibly removed.

19:20.056 --> 19:23.390
We'll find another way.

19:23.392 --> 19:26.560
Looks like it's time for plan "B."

19:26.562 --> 19:28.429
Mr. Gold?

19:28.431 --> 19:29.663
Mrs. Gold.

19:36.451 --> 19:38.700
Uh, excuse me, you're not
supposed to be in here.

19:38.725 --> 19:40.241
- We know.
- Yeah.

19:40.243 --> 19:41.775
We're sorry to come at you like this,

19:41.777 --> 19:43.611
but we believe your
husband, Gabriel Carrera,

19:43.613 --> 19:45.278
has gotten himself into trouble.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.279
I don't understand.

19:46.281 --> 19:48.281
We believe he's preparing
to flee the country...

19:48.283 --> 19:49.783
And worse, for a crime he didn't commit.

19:49.785 --> 19:51.484
Our office has been
looking into Mr. Carrera

19:51.486 --> 19:53.353
for helping Venezuelan ex-pats

19:53.355 --> 19:54.921
here in America launder their money.

19:54.923 --> 19:58.025
That's a joke. Gabriel
won't even double-park.

19:58.027 --> 19:59.860
We know. We looked into him.

19:59.862 --> 20:01.494
We just think he's being
made a patsy by someone

20:01.496 --> 20:02.428
from the government, and he wants

20:02.430 --> 20:04.631
to leave the country
before he's arrested.

20:04.633 --> 20:05.798
That's ridiculous.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.368
He's right upstairs. I'll go get him.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.970
Do you know where your daughter
is right now, Mr. Robertson?

20:12.974 --> 20:14.340
Ginger, our nanny,

20:14.342 --> 20:16.108
is picking up Isabel from school.

20:16.110 --> 20:17.477
Are you sure?

20:17.479 --> 20:19.136
Because from what we know,

20:19.161 --> 20:22.896
they're boarding a 4:45
flight to Caracas as we speak.

20:26.453 --> 20:30.355
Are you sure you're up for this today?

20:30.357 --> 20:31.523
Why wouldn't I be?

20:31.525 --> 20:33.793
Because you almost ran out on
the last mission we went on.

20:33.795 --> 20:36.628
You mean when I stayed
to clean up your mess?

20:38.065 --> 20:39.464
That's our call.

20:43.671 --> 20:46.371
Foxhall Elementary.

20:46.373 --> 20:50.409
Yes, Mr. Robertson, I know who you are.

20:50.411 --> 20:53.812
Your husband was here over an hour ago.

20:53.814 --> 20:56.414
He took Isabel out of class.

20:56.416 --> 20:57.648
Mr. Robertson?

20:58.785 --> 21:04.022
If they land in Venezuela,
you may never see her again.

21:04.024 --> 21:06.925
They don't recognize marriage equality.

21:06.927 --> 21:07.858
What can I do?

21:07.860 --> 21:10.394
Just let us have a
look at Gabriel's files

21:10.396 --> 21:11.829
upstairs at the data center.

21:11.831 --> 21:14.432
We just need to confirm a
few things, get a warrant,

21:14.434 --> 21:16.434
and stop that plane.

21:16.436 --> 21:19.303
We can get your little girl back.

21:22.108 --> 21:23.674
Follow me.

21:23.676 --> 21:25.275
Just don't talk to anyone.

21:25.277 --> 21:27.377
- Of course.
- Okay.

21:39.190 --> 21:39.889
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:39.891 --> 21:41.424
Is there a restroom upstairs?

21:41.426 --> 21:43.460
No one but Consulate
staff is allowed upstairs.

21:43.462 --> 21:46.129
Oh, well, that's odd,
'cause I thought I saw

21:46.131 --> 21:49.565
a fellow visa applicant
head right up there alone.

21:49.567 --> 21:52.401
Frank, do you want to cover me, here?

21:55.106 --> 21:57.039
You want to dance, let's dance.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.476
You told me I was going undercover

22:00.478 --> 22:02.444
to stop people from getting killed.

22:02.446 --> 22:06.214
Instead, the group of
people you sent me in with

22:06.216 --> 22:07.716
has been killing people.

22:07.718 --> 22:09.151
It wasn't supposed to go this far.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.219
Did you know that my
sister was gonna be here?

22:11.221 --> 22:12.621
I told you that it wouldn't be easy.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.790
There might be sacrifices.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.659
I've been doing everything
that I can to keep her safe.

22:17.661 --> 22:19.460
I even had to lie to her

22:19.462 --> 22:21.797
to prove to them that she's
not who they're looking for.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.631
All that, for what, Miranda?

22:23.633 --> 22:24.866
For nothing.

22:24.868 --> 22:29.604
We failed because we aligned
ourselves with the wrong people.

22:29.606 --> 22:32.274
I believed we were doing
this for our country.

22:32.276 --> 22:35.810
Right now, we need to get inside.

22:35.812 --> 22:39.814
We need to find Lydia
Hall and get those drives.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.784
N... no... no, no. We need
to get those hostages first.

22:42.786 --> 22:44.485
The drives are more important.

22:44.487 --> 22:46.487
I told you, Alex.

22:46.489 --> 22:48.523
Miranda, you go find Lydia,

22:48.525 --> 22:50.657
and Nimah and I will
go get the hostages.

22:50.659 --> 22:53.794
Now, can we put the gun down
and face the real enemy, please?

22:59.705 --> 23:01.672
I'm sorry.

23:01.697 --> 23:04.743
Lydia Hall will not trust me alone.

23:04.768 --> 23:06.121
So I need you

23:06.123 --> 23:07.922
to come with me, Alex.

23:07.924 --> 23:12.327
100 people are important,
but millions of lives

23:12.329 --> 23:16.231
will be lost if those drives
fall into the wrong hands.

23:18.102 --> 23:20.969
Alex, move.

23:30.814 --> 23:32.847
Go, Alex.

23:32.849 --> 23:34.148
You'll be okay here with her?

23:34.150 --> 23:35.449
I'll deal with it.

23:35.451 --> 23:37.651
Go.

23:37.653 --> 23:39.120
Go.

23:39.122 --> 23:41.188
You're making a big mistake.

23:41.190 --> 23:43.491
Alex, don't!

23:50.133 --> 23:51.465
The files are in here.

23:51.467 --> 23:53.934
My card will access them.

23:55.804 --> 23:57.838
What's the matter?

23:57.840 --> 23:58.772
I should call Gabriel.

23:58.774 --> 24:01.675
No. There isn't time.

24:01.677 --> 24:04.044
Without a warrant, we
can't stop that plane,

24:04.046 --> 24:06.379
and we need these files
to get that warrant.

24:06.381 --> 24:07.915
Sorry, this is just all so crazy.

24:07.917 --> 24:09.549
I-I need to talk to him.

24:09.551 --> 24:10.683
He took your daughter.

24:10.685 --> 24:12.852
He didn't tell you about
the trouble that he was in.

24:12.854 --> 24:15.055
How could you trust him
in that state of mind?

24:15.057 --> 24:16.889
I just need to hear his voice.

24:16.891 --> 24:19.492
Okay, I wanted to do this the easy way.

24:19.494 --> 24:20.626
Who are you people?

24:20.628 --> 24:22.962
We're the ones who have your daughter.

24:27.669 --> 24:28.901
When are my dads coming?

24:28.903 --> 24:30.536
They'll be here soon.

24:30.538 --> 24:33.005
I promise.

24:35.610 --> 24:37.009
Start filming.

24:37.011 --> 24:38.343
We should take her back.

24:38.345 --> 24:39.845
We should finish what we started.

24:39.847 --> 24:41.547
Do it.

24:41.549 --> 24:42.614
Isabel.

24:42.616 --> 24:44.883
Salude a tu papi.

24:44.885 --> 24:46.085
Hola, papa.

24:47.254 --> 24:48.420
If you hurt her...

24:48.422 --> 24:51.022
Just give us the files, and
we'll free your daughter.

24:51.024 --> 24:52.791
You'll never see us again.

24:57.565 --> 24:58.763
Keep a lookout.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.951
Excuse me, miss?

25:20.953 --> 25:24.655
Miss, stop where you are right now.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.758
Miss?

25:27.760 --> 25:31.061
We had a report of unauthorized
personnel on this floor.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.097
Can you identify yourself?

25:35.835 --> 25:36.800
Ma'am?

25:36.802 --> 25:37.935
I hate this game.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.604
They'll be here soon, sweetheart.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.172
Who are you again?

25:42.174 --> 25:44.708
We told you. We're friends.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.151
Go. Just go.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.585
- Go.
- Wait, what are you doing?

25:55.587 --> 25:58.155
Wait. Isa... what are you...

25:58.157 --> 25:59.322
We got what we needed.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.258
We didn't need her anymore.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.026
You don't know that.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.832
What are you doing? You
got what you came here for.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.968
Mnh-mnh-mnh. This will
only take a second.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.137
Consider this one a personal favor.

26:14.139 --> 26:17.473
Come on, you've already
aided an act of treason.

26:17.475 --> 26:20.476
Aren't we just splitting hairs now?

26:25.883 --> 26:27.883
- I see you made it past the...
- Ryan, we need help.

26:27.885 --> 26:29.185
Something went wrong.

26:29.187 --> 26:30.986
The security guard you sent after me...

26:30.988 --> 26:32.521
Harry, he's hurt.

26:32.523 --> 26:33.355
Mmm.

26:33.357 --> 26:35.057
And you really expect me to buy that?

26:35.059 --> 26:36.692
This isn't a game!

26:36.694 --> 26:38.326
I need you right now.

26:38.328 --> 26:42.230
Are we not working together anymore?

26:42.232 --> 26:43.965
All right.

26:47.037 --> 26:49.805
Will you do me a favor
and wait here for a second?

27:03.052 --> 27:04.699
Alex?

27:13.395 --> 27:15.863
Are you kidding me?

27:15.865 --> 27:18.199
I gave you first crack, Booth.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.499
You should've taken it.

27:19.501 --> 27:21.702
I'll meet you out back.

27:21.704 --> 27:23.070
So that's it, huh?

27:23.072 --> 27:24.004
You're pushing me out?

27:24.006 --> 27:26.173
You're literally going
to obstruct justice

27:26.175 --> 27:27.774
and put your little
crusade above the law...

27:27.776 --> 27:29.909
And worse, sacrifice
your fiancé for it.

27:29.911 --> 27:31.845
As if you weren't
gonna do the same thing.

27:31.847 --> 27:33.513
- Of course I wasn't.
- Yes, you would have.

27:33.515 --> 27:36.617
If not this assignment,
then the next one.

27:36.619 --> 27:38.585
I know that because I
would've done the same thing

27:38.587 --> 27:39.853
if I was in your shoes.

27:39.855 --> 27:41.921
Harry played me your conversation.

27:41.923 --> 27:44.557
The only thing Harry
played was both of us.

27:44.559 --> 27:46.626
Even if he did, what does it matter?

27:46.628 --> 27:48.694
There isn't enough room
at The Farm for both of us.

27:48.696 --> 27:49.863
You have to admit it.

27:49.865 --> 27:50.930
You're right.

27:50.932 --> 27:53.566
This isn't your job
anymore, it's just mine.

27:53.568 --> 27:56.002
It was yours.

27:56.537 --> 27:58.304
Have fun explaining

27:58.306 --> 28:00.373
to the police how you
ended up like that.

28:00.375 --> 28:03.776
Your bags will be ready when
you get back to The Farm.

28:05.312 --> 28:06.444
Give me that!

28:06.446 --> 28:07.646
Give me the key.

28:08.749 --> 28:10.214
Aren't you sick of this?

28:10.216 --> 28:11.716
No, Alex, I'm not sick of it.

28:11.718 --> 28:12.984
I hate it.

28:12.986 --> 28:15.387
I hate what it's doing to us.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.322
Look, I know that we
said whatever happens here

28:17.324 --> 28:19.658
doesn't change things
between us, but look, Alex.

28:19.660 --> 28:20.759
Look at what's happening.

28:20.761 --> 28:23.327
If you do this, if this
is where we are right now,

28:23.329 --> 28:24.962
how are we ever gonna
get back to where we were

28:24.964 --> 28:26.864
before this all started?

28:31.936 --> 28:34.030
Parrish will be the key for us.

28:34.055 --> 28:37.877
I am closer to her now
than I have ever been.

28:37.879 --> 28:39.712
The field is clear for her

28:39.714 --> 28:41.914
to become a great asset
for us within the CIA.

28:41.916 --> 28:44.984
And she will give us entrée
we need to get to the other one.

28:44.986 --> 28:47.719
Has the day yielded
anything else of value?

28:47.721 --> 28:48.786
No.

28:48.788 --> 28:49.888
Nope, it hasn't,

28:49.890 --> 28:52.790
but I will let you know if
anything new does come in.

28:52.792 --> 28:55.227
Okay, look, just love
to Pip and the girls.

28:55.229 --> 28:56.328
Bye.

29:09.242 --> 29:11.843
You're, uh... you're Carly, aren't you?

29:11.845 --> 29:12.844
Sebastian's friend?

29:12.846 --> 29:14.979
Yes, that's right.

29:14.981 --> 29:16.681
Is... he okay?

29:16.683 --> 29:17.782
Yes.

29:17.784 --> 29:19.783
Yeah... sorry... yes.

29:19.785 --> 29:21.256
I just... I wanted to say hello.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.654
I'm Harry. I'm his, uh...

29:23.656 --> 29:24.588
I'm his flatmate.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.990
Sorry. I-I didn't
know he had a roommate.

29:26.992 --> 29:28.692
I barely know him.

29:28.694 --> 29:29.826
We've just met.

29:29.828 --> 29:31.995
Yeah, well, I barely know him, too,

29:31.997 --> 29:34.131
and I've lived with him
for under half a year.

29:34.133 --> 29:37.333
But I just think
Sebastian doesn't open up

29:37.335 --> 29:39.836
to that many people.

29:39.838 --> 29:42.305
Anyway... uh...

29:44.777 --> 29:46.643
Am I...

29:46.645 --> 29:49.112
doing the right thing?

29:49.114 --> 29:50.948
I work on the Hill.

29:50.950 --> 29:53.349
That's a long commute for a guy.

29:53.351 --> 29:55.151
For anything, really.

29:55.153 --> 29:57.887
It's just, I don't meet many people

29:57.889 --> 29:59.370
who aren't in the government.

29:59.372 --> 30:04.538
And he's just so kind and decent.

30:04.563 --> 30:06.696
And who's decent anymore?

30:06.698 --> 30:08.558
Yeah... no, I know.
You're... You're right.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.701
He's... well, he's
a very special person.

30:11.703 --> 30:15.437
He, uh, follows the rules,
doesn't give in to temptation.

30:17.075 --> 30:21.077
He's uncorrupted, which, in this world,

30:21.079 --> 30:24.413
is a harder and harder thing to be.

30:24.415 --> 30:26.081
Anyway, nice to meet you.

30:26.083 --> 30:27.682
Good night.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.160
Oh.

30:41.098 --> 30:42.563
Evening, Harry.

30:42.565 --> 30:44.866
Evening.

30:48.772 --> 30:51.673
You had him right where you wanted.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.301
You mean right where you wanted.

30:53.326 --> 30:54.408
I don't believe you.

30:54.410 --> 30:55.710
You're back where you started.

30:55.712 --> 30:57.178
You're making an emotional call,

30:57.180 --> 30:59.913
allowing your relationship
to stand in your way.

30:59.915 --> 31:04.051
You betrayed a mission for it.

31:04.053 --> 31:05.520
Why?

31:05.522 --> 31:08.922
Because my relationship
gives me strength, Harry.

31:08.924 --> 31:09.890
It doesn't hold me back.

31:09.892 --> 31:12.092
It allows me to
accomplish whatever I need,

31:12.094 --> 31:13.927
including this.

31:13.929 --> 31:16.130
We're done.

31:16.132 --> 31:18.966
I'm cutting you loose.
You're a free agent now.

31:18.968 --> 31:20.433
Oh, and, um...

31:20.435 --> 31:23.070
I have all the help that I need.

31:23.072 --> 31:24.972
It's not you.

31:27.043 --> 31:29.309
What happens when he changes his mind?

31:29.311 --> 31:31.944
He won't!

31:31.946 --> 31:33.079
He will.

31:35.651 --> 31:39.052
You want to talk about what
happened during that operation?

31:39.054 --> 31:40.720
We did what we were told to.

31:40.722 --> 31:42.789
Yeah, until you let that girl go.

31:42.791 --> 31:44.791
Our part of the mission was complete.

31:44.793 --> 31:47.126
You didn't know that at the time.

31:47.128 --> 31:49.428
What if we needed more from her?

31:49.430 --> 31:51.764
I had a moment of weakness, okay?

31:51.766 --> 31:53.800
Sometimes a moment is all it takes.

31:53.802 --> 31:56.102
Why are you being so hard on me?

31:56.104 --> 31:59.405
Last week, you couldn't
even complete the assignment.

31:59.407 --> 32:02.175
We grabbed a child today, León.

32:02.177 --> 32:03.975
We convinced her she could trust us

32:03.977 --> 32:06.579
so that we could take
her away from her family.

32:06.581 --> 32:08.414
I know what it's like to be young

32:08.416 --> 32:10.949
and trust the wrong people.

32:10.951 --> 32:14.119
And I'm being hard on you
because you keep doing this.

32:14.121 --> 32:16.021
Two steps forward, four steps back.

32:16.023 --> 32:18.123
You can't pick and choose
how far you're gonna go,

32:18.125 --> 32:20.458
and you can't keep
struggling with who you are.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.794
The day I stop struggling with who I am

32:22.796 --> 32:25.130
is the day I'll die.

32:29.502 --> 32:31.636
You have doubts, Dayana.

32:31.638 --> 32:33.338
You have doubts about what you've done

32:33.340 --> 32:35.140
and doubts about who you are.

32:35.142 --> 32:37.842
That makes you weak,
and that will bring you down.

32:37.844 --> 32:39.777
You betray yourself every day

32:39.779 --> 32:41.912
by not choosing which side to play.

32:48.020 --> 32:50.288
And you?

32:50.290 --> 32:53.190
You doubt nothing in your life?

32:53.192 --> 32:57.795
Sometimes people doubt
themselves for a reason.

32:57.797 --> 33:00.164
Just give up.

33:12.978 --> 33:15.145
You want to explain this?

33:15.147 --> 33:19.516
I may have been on the sidelines
today, but I'm always watching.

33:19.518 --> 33:22.586
You two nearly got yourselves
and everyone around you

33:22.588 --> 33:24.354
burned during this operation.

33:24.356 --> 33:26.089
It was beyond reckless.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.024
What you did doesn't
just end operations,

33:28.026 --> 33:30.260
it doesn't just end careers,
it sends people to jail.

33:30.262 --> 33:32.762
And I think that just
might be where you belong,

33:32.764 --> 33:36.132
unless you can give me one
good reason why you don't.

33:38.670 --> 33:41.737
Who are you?

33:41.739 --> 33:43.639
And what are you really doing here?

33:49.380 --> 33:50.913
Alex was trying to get me burned

33:50.915 --> 33:54.249
because she's jealous that
you recruited both of us.

33:54.251 --> 33:57.420
She knew she'd been cut out of
the loop, and she wants back in.

33:57.422 --> 33:59.121
She thinks I'm the one that burned her,

33:59.123 --> 34:01.857
so she was trying to
get me out of the way.

34:01.859 --> 34:05.961
Which is why today I
was trying to get her

34:05.963 --> 34:08.931
kicked out before she
unraveled everything

34:08.933 --> 34:10.331
that you've been working for.

34:13.904 --> 34:16.070
Well, thanks for bringing
this to my attention.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.868
Good night.

34:23.313 --> 34:25.213
Good night.

34:31.955 --> 34:35.621
I can't. I can't betray my country,

34:35.623 --> 34:37.891
my oath, my friends.

34:37.893 --> 34:41.261
People deserve to know
what the AIC are capable of.

34:41.263 --> 34:42.762
They deserved to know it last year

34:42.764 --> 34:44.297
when we could've prevented today.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.998
If that paper goes
out, it will be decades

34:46.001 --> 34:47.800
before another woman is on the ticket,

34:47.802 --> 34:49.101
let alone the Oval Office.

34:49.103 --> 34:50.303
We don't know that.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.505
Right now, you are president.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.674
Listen, there's a version of this

34:54.676 --> 34:56.275
where you trust everyone around you

34:56.277 --> 34:58.310
and it probably works out for you.

34:58.312 --> 35:00.513
But you wouldn't have flown to New York

35:00.515 --> 35:02.515
in the middle of a national crisis

35:02.517 --> 35:04.016
if that is what you wanted.

35:04.018 --> 35:07.286
You said you wanted
my help to call it off.

35:07.288 --> 35:08.388
You want to say "no."

35:08.390 --> 35:11.357
And if that means owning up
to the role you had in it,

35:11.359 --> 35:14.526
then you know what, that's two
right things you'll do today.

35:16.297 --> 35:19.664
I wish I could be more like you, Shelby.

35:20.601 --> 35:24.003
Actually, I was you 25 years ago.

35:24.005 --> 35:26.038
I believed in the American dream.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.274
But now I know better.

35:29.276 --> 35:31.276
"We the people" means
"We the corporations,"

35:31.278 --> 35:34.946
justice still depends on
the color of one's skin.

35:34.948 --> 35:37.282
Now I have a chance to
help change all that.

35:37.284 --> 35:40.685
I will not give it up.
I need another option.

35:40.687 --> 35:44.055
Call off the air strike.

35:44.057 --> 35:47.125
Send in a team to breach the perimeter.

35:47.127 --> 35:49.360
It might get messy, and there will be

35:49.362 --> 35:51.129
no parade at the end,

35:51.131 --> 35:54.799
but you will have
done right by everyone.

35:54.801 --> 35:57.235
Isn't that the better legacy

35:57.237 --> 36:02.372
of the first female president
of the United States,

36:02.374 --> 36:04.685
even if it costs you your job?

36:10.427 --> 36:12.986
Okay, I'm gonna go run a few errands

36:13.011 --> 36:14.304
before I meet up with León.

36:14.329 --> 36:16.246
Just text me when you
meet, and I'll get out.

36:16.248 --> 36:18.081
I always do.

36:18.083 --> 36:19.348
Do the dishes.

36:19.350 --> 36:21.384
I always do.

36:21.386 --> 36:24.420
Have fun, Jane.

36:30.461 --> 36:32.428
Forgot your keys again?

36:33.565 --> 36:35.898
Can I help you? You can't
just walk into people's...

36:35.900 --> 36:38.901
You know who I am.

36:38.903 --> 36:40.803
You must be Jane's friend.

36:40.805 --> 36:42.405
She just left not 10 seconds ago.

36:42.407 --> 36:44.473
Yeah, someone just left,

36:44.475 --> 36:47.410
but her name's not Jane.

36:47.412 --> 36:50.112
I know what you've been doing.

36:50.114 --> 36:52.881
You're FBI, both of you.

36:52.883 --> 36:55.450
Trying to get to me, to The Farm.

36:55.452 --> 36:59.788
- I don't know what you're...
- You were right to.

36:59.790 --> 37:02.057
What they're doing there is not right.

37:02.059 --> 37:04.392
It reminds me of places I've
been right before an uprising.

37:04.394 --> 37:06.461
You can feel it coming.

37:06.463 --> 37:09.097
I will tell you everything I know.

37:09.099 --> 37:10.998
I will work for you.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.368
But only directly, not through her.

37:17.941 --> 37:19.307
Why?

37:19.309 --> 37:22.444
They made me kill someone for no reason.

37:22.446 --> 37:24.511
The people I'm with, I care about them,

37:24.513 --> 37:25.716
and I want to get them out.

37:25.741 --> 37:26.981
But whatever's happening,

37:26.983 --> 37:29.316
I'm afraid it will destroy them, too.

37:29.318 --> 37:31.152
I came to the CIA because I didn't want

37:31.154 --> 37:32.186
to act selfishly anymore,

37:32.188 --> 37:34.122
I didn't want to just
stand around and do nothing.

37:34.124 --> 37:35.422
But what they're making me do there...

37:35.424 --> 37:37.625
Let me talk to my people.

37:41.264 --> 37:45.399
So, what's her name?

37:48.170 --> 37:51.272
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.

37:51.274 --> 37:53.707
Is any of this real?

37:53.709 --> 37:56.377
No.

37:56.379 --> 37:58.845
I'll let you know as soon
as I talk to my superior.

38:02.684 --> 38:04.818
Speak to them quickly.

38:04.820 --> 38:06.486
Things are moving fast.

38:15.497 --> 38:18.531
What are you doing in my room?

38:18.533 --> 38:20.400
I'm here to talk.

38:24.539 --> 38:25.538
About?

38:25.540 --> 38:27.407
A group at The Farm

38:27.409 --> 38:31.510
secretly selecting recruits
for covert training.

38:33.414 --> 38:35.146
Wow.

38:35.148 --> 38:37.749
I didn't think you'd
drop the mask that easy.

38:37.751 --> 38:40.485
You have the phone.

38:40.487 --> 38:43.254
Come on.

38:45.492 --> 38:48.726
This is how they contact you?

38:48.728 --> 38:50.695
Hmm?

38:52.265 --> 38:55.099
"They?"

38:55.101 --> 38:57.535
You really think I'd be
part of a secret organization

38:57.537 --> 39:00.404
to train recruits at The Farm?

39:00.406 --> 39:03.041
After all this time, that's who I am?

39:03.043 --> 39:03.999
That's how I operate?

39:04.024 --> 39:06.191
I have dedicated my life to this agency.

39:06.216 --> 39:07.882
I've dedicated my life to this country.

39:07.907 --> 39:09.240
And I'm supposed to believe that?

39:09.265 --> 39:11.932
I don't play games, Alex. I train spies.

39:11.957 --> 39:13.761
I train patriots to serve their country.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.453
And I don't what you've
gotten yourself into,

39:15.455 --> 39:17.421
but if you don't start telling
me everything right now,

39:17.423 --> 39:20.257
I swear to God I will have
you arrested for espionage

39:20.259 --> 39:22.960
and make sure you don't see
the light of day for a decade.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.816
Anyone know what we're doing here?

39:49.454 --> 39:52.221
You have a lot to be proud of.

39:52.223 --> 39:58.560
Few make it this far, and fewer
yet make it where we're going.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.562
Yeah? Where's that?

40:00.564 --> 40:02.965
What are we?

40:02.967 --> 40:04.300
You tell me.

40:07.996 --> 40:11.573
No one knows what this is?

40:11.575 --> 40:13.509
You've lied for it, killed for it,

40:13.511 --> 40:15.944
and you can't even tell me what this is?

40:17.615 --> 40:19.981
It's the CIA.

40:19.983 --> 40:22.484
Everyone at The Farm, at Langley,

40:22.486 --> 40:26.421
at stations around the world
think they're a part of the CIA,

40:26.423 --> 40:27.622
but it's the people here.

40:27.624 --> 40:31.859
It's the people who do what
we do who are the true CIA.

40:31.861 --> 40:35.630
We make the real
choices, real sacrifices,

40:35.632 --> 40:38.199
without anyone knowing the truth.

40:38.201 --> 40:40.501
For the rest of your time at The Farm,

40:40.503 --> 40:43.671
we will be meeting and training
under everyone's noses...

40:43.673 --> 40:47.675
The way that you will for
the rest of your careers,

40:47.677 --> 40:50.511
the way that we who truly love America

40:50.513 --> 40:52.780
have always had to operate.

40:52.782 --> 40:53.781
Where's Alex?

40:53.783 --> 40:56.016
She didn't make the cut.

40:56.018 --> 40:58.519
Welcome to the other side.

40:58.521 --> 41:01.355
Madam President, the
F-22s are 50 klicks

41:01.357 --> 41:03.623
from the target,

41:03.625 --> 41:05.826
closing in and weapons-free.

41:08.797 --> 41:12.666
GBU-28s armed and online.

41:12.668 --> 41:14.501
30 seconds out, Madam President.

41:17.906 --> 41:21.007
We are a go.

41:21.009 --> 41:23.977
Do we have final
approval, Madam President?

41:31.752 --> 41:32.918
Call it off.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.754
Stand down. Do not engage target.

41:35.756 --> 41:38.924
I repeat. Stand down.
Do not engage target.

41:41.028 --> 41:43.729
What now, Madam President?

41:43.731 --> 41:45.097
Now we save them.

41:46.333 --> 41:47.700
Shelby.

41:47.702 --> 41:48.567
Alex, where are you?

41:48.569 --> 41:50.836
I'm heading back into the perimeter.

41:50.838 --> 41:52.605
My phone will be jammed once I get in.

41:52.607 --> 41:54.389
Listen... the strike,
is it still happening?

41:54.414 --> 41:55.540
It's off, but it's not over.

41:55.542 --> 41:56.774
They're gonna breach instead.

41:56.776 --> 42:00.223
A specialized hostage-rescue
team is going in, weapons hot.

42:00.248 --> 42:01.513
Where are you, Alex?

42:01.515 --> 42:03.448
Exactly where I need to be.

42:03.450 --> 42:05.150
I'll see you soon.
