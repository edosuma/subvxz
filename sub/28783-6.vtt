WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.610
200 grand in debt, this little farm.

00:02.660 --> 00:04.610
I don't want any favours off you.

00:04.660 --> 00:06.610
You've got something Oleg wants.

00:06.660 --> 00:09.610
That cup could give me
cause for a mistrial.

00:09.660 --> 00:10.610
It's inadmissible.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.610
Cross contamination. No probable cause.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.760
That's where you came in. He
needed a result and you got him one.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.610
The time was a police officer cadet

00:23.660 --> 00:26.610
would get two years' subsidised housing

00:26.660 --> 00:28.610
and state-of-the-art leisure facilities

00:28.660 --> 00:31.290
for the duration of his training.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.660
Well, those days have
long gone. Thank Christ.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.970
So, Tredmon Holdings

00:37.020 --> 00:39.610
are going to take this white
elephant off our hands.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.970
They're going to pay
for all the renovations.

00:43.020 --> 00:47.610
And then they rent it back
to us at 56% off market rate.

00:47.660 --> 00:50.610
- You can only sell a property once.
- 25 years, Bill.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.610
We'll be long gone.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.660
I'll be in Phuket and you'll be
in Arizona on the fifth Mrs Hixon.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.940
Unless you've got a better idea.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.660
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

01:02.660 --> 01:04.660
Why should anybody else take our profit?

01:06.660 --> 01:08.610
I say we sell 160 of these residences

01:08.660 --> 01:10.610
to our own officers and staff

01:10.660 --> 01:13.970
for a 5% down payment on
a mortgage we guarantee,

01:14.020 --> 01:16.610
giving us the exact same
number you wanted me to cut.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.650
Yeah, by firing cops.

01:18.700 --> 01:22.810
600 salaries off my balance
sheet, you promised me.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.970
But if we do this, we don't
have to cut a single cop.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.610
This is the biggest police
district in the country

01:28.660 --> 01:30.610
with the lowest police numbers.

01:30.660 --> 01:33.290
600 cops isn't fat, it's muscle.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.610
What's happened to you, hey?

01:35.660 --> 01:38.290
I hired an ice-cold assassin.

01:38.340 --> 01:40.610
You've turned out to be
more like fucking Bagpuss.

01:40.660 --> 01:44.450
Why don't you stick to doing
what I hired you to do,

01:44.500 --> 01:46.610
firing cops, saving me money?

01:46.660 --> 01:49.660
Leave all this complex
stuff to the experts, hey?

01:51.660 --> 01:53.610
Yeah, well, that's the problem.

01:53.660 --> 01:56.660
I've looked behind the curtain
here and there's no wizard.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074

02:51.660 --> 02:53.660
Jesus Christ...

03:01.660 --> 03:03.610
Oh, no. No, no...

03:03.660 --> 03:06.180
Urgh! This is shit!

03:07.860 --> 03:09.500
Fuck!

03:11.660 --> 03:14.610
We have five victims.

03:14.660 --> 03:15.660
Jesus...

03:18.660 --> 03:20.610
- An aversion to death?
- Yeah.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.610
A healthy one.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.810
I had enough of the smell of
burned flesh last night, thank you.

03:24.860 --> 03:29.020
The victims are all male,
approximately 30 to 50 years old.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.660
Nails in every one of them.

03:36.660 --> 03:39.660
- All in the back of the head.
- The medulla oblongata.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.660
They were executed.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.610
All five bodies are so far unidentified.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.610
None are present on the
police DNA database.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.610
Hey, close that.

03:56.660 --> 04:00.610
We don't need some long-lens
journalist sticking this online.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.290
The bodies were found burning
here at Tointon Turkey Farm.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.610
Eric Tointon and his
family are in the Bahamas.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.610
Well, what else is a turkey
breeder going to do in January?

04:08.660 --> 04:10.610
Isotopes from hair, teeth and skin

04:10.660 --> 04:14.610
suggest the victims were living
in the UK prior to their deaths.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.610
The presumed murder weapon
is an industrial nail gun.

04:17.660 --> 04:20.610
When did this place become
a gangsters' paradise?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.290
Since someone suggested cutting
police numbers in half.

04:23.340 --> 04:25.650
We have very little time
before this gets out.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.610
Someone out there knows something.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.610
Who were these lads?

04:30.660 --> 04:31.660
Who did this to them?

04:33.860 --> 04:37.610
Lydia, do you know Tredmon Holdings?

04:37.660 --> 04:40.610
It's a hedge fund that specialises
in property development.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.610
- Are you looking to invest?
- Huh.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.610
I suppose that bonus isn't
going to spend itself.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.610
Great excitement out there, sir.

04:46.660 --> 04:49.610
Five executions. You've really
brought the Florida swamps

04:49.660 --> 04:50.610
to the Lincolnshire marshes.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.610
- I didn't kill them.
- The thing is, this isn't Florida.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.610
We don't have executions here,
let alone five in one go.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.610
We don't have the resources
to investigate a serial killer

04:58.660 --> 05:01.610
or a gangland feud or whatever this is.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.860
Especially not now.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.610
Your mother said I'd find you in here.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.660
Your happy place.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.610
So, just an off-the-rack power tool, huh?

05:28.660 --> 05:30.130
They must have modified it.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.610
I mean, to get it to the
midbrain, you'd have to make

05:32.660 --> 05:35.560
some pretty serious adjustments
on the factory's default.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.660
This guy needs to be stopped.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.610
I'm thinking National Crime Agency.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.610
It's your FBI. That's who I'd be calling.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.160
Organised crime's their
job. This is too big for us.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.610
A buck passed is a buck lost.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.610
That's what you've taught me.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.610
I've done the research.

05:55.660 --> 05:58.610
There was 11 nail gun fatalities
in ten years in the US.

05:58.660 --> 05:59.610
There were four in Russia.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.660
But in the UK...

06:02.660 --> 06:04.610
.. seven over nine years.

06:04.660 --> 06:07.500
All traced back to the same man.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.660
Frank McGill.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.970
Born in Dublin in 1948.

06:14.020 --> 06:15.610
He came to Manchester when he was 14.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.810
He was involved in a series
of gang-related killings

06:18.860 --> 06:20.610
in the Moss Side in the early '90s.

06:20.660 --> 06:23.610
He was convicted in 1997,
three life sentences.

06:23.660 --> 06:26.340
He'll be 71 years old now.

06:27.660 --> 06:29.610
Is he in prison or dead?

06:29.660 --> 06:31.610
Well, that's the gnarl of it, sir.

06:31.660 --> 06:33.610
There's no death record.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.610
There's no sign of him in
any jail in these islands.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.610
It's like he's disappeared.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.810
You read about him.

06:39.860 --> 06:42.660
What makes you think somebody else didn't?

06:43.660 --> 06:45.610
It wasn't released, sir.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.660
It was only in the police report.

06:48.660 --> 06:51.660
We need to find Frank McGill.

06:57.660 --> 07:00.130
Prawn cocktail in a potato chip.

07:00.180 --> 07:03.610
I will never understand you
or the people you come from.

07:03.660 --> 07:05.610
That's a first.

07:05.660 --> 07:09.450
I also had a day of firsts today.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.450
I had to recuse myself
from Her Majesty's bench.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.610
Apparently, a senior
serving police officer

07:14.660 --> 07:16.610
in the East Lincolnshire Constabulary

07:16.660 --> 07:18.970
improperly obtained DNA
from a murder suspect.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.650
You can see why I couldn't
hear the application.

07:21.700 --> 07:27.660
Somehow DS Blair's defence team
got a coffee cup from my desk.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.610
They're trying to discredit you, Bill.

07:31.660 --> 07:35.060
Yeah, well, they'll try anything to
get Blair off. Don't worry about me.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.660
Frank McGill.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.660
A nail gun? Fuck me, who is this man?

07:44.660 --> 07:47.610
A ghost. He was convicted 20 years ago

07:47.660 --> 07:49.610
and there's no record of
him serving time anywhere.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.610
He's just disappeared.

07:51.660 --> 07:52.610
Extradited?

07:52.660 --> 07:54.610
He's not on any PNC list.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.660
Then Muriel found that.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.610
Nine members of the Maguire gang,

07:59.660 --> 08:02.610
convicted on the evidence
of an informant in 1997.

08:02.660 --> 08:06.610
So he righted out his own gang
and he's in witness protection.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.610
Well, good luck with that.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.450
Frank McGill doesn't exist any more.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.610
I'll tell the five guys on the slab.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.610
You could talk to the PPS.
If you can convince them

08:14.660 --> 08:16.970
there's strong evidence
he's committed another crime,

08:17.020 --> 08:19.520
they might lead you to him.
But I wouldn't bet on it.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.659
What's coming?

08:45.660 --> 08:48.610
Frank McGill was a hitman for
the Maguires back in the day.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.610
A hitman, what, in witness
protection here in Lincolnshire?

08:51.660 --> 08:55.130
Frank turned on them in '97.
He put half the family away.

08:55.180 --> 08:56.970
Three died in jail.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.610
Two are still serving time.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.970
Terence Maguire, capo di tutti capi,

09:01.020 --> 09:03.820
dying in the medical wing of
Strangeways with dementia.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.610
Nice.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.610
Who's the babe?

09:09.660 --> 09:11.610
That's the boss' missus,
the lovely Pauline.

09:11.660 --> 09:13.660
Lucky Terence.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.970
Are you cleaning that
window or jumping out of it?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.610
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

09:24.660 --> 09:26.610
You've been making inquiries into a man

09:26.660 --> 09:28.610
you shouldn't be making inquiries into.

09:28.660 --> 09:31.610
- I've had the Home Office on.
- Yeah.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.610
Frank McGill's a suspect
in multiple homicides.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.130
Why won't they let us talk to him?

09:35.180 --> 09:37.610
Well, I think that's witness protection.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.610
- You know, protecting the witness.
- From us?

09:40.660 --> 09:42.610
Who's protecting the
public from their witness?

09:42.660 --> 09:44.610
You can't help yourself, can you, hey?

09:44.660 --> 09:49.610
You can't help but draw attention to
yourself for all the wrong reasons.

09:49.660 --> 09:53.660
Our friend Alex, DS Blair as
was, he's applied for bail.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.610
His lawyers seem to think
that the conviction's unsafe.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.660
Do you know why?

10:01.020 --> 10:02.810
Police malfeasance.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.610
Well, I'm sure it's all bullshit.

10:05.660 --> 10:07.130
Yeah.

10:07.180 --> 10:10.290
And I'm pretty sure
that he'll probably walk.

10:10.340 --> 10:13.660
And if he does, that'll be down to you.

10:14.660 --> 10:16.660
Well, at least I've got my friends.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.610
The thing about friends is, Bill,

10:19.660 --> 10:23.860
they tend to fuck off, you know,
when you start shitting on them.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.160
Sir.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.150
Someone stole evidence from my desk.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.110
I'm sorry, sir.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.110
It could be anybody,

10:57.160 --> 10:59.110
the cleaning crew to
the Crime Commissioner,

10:59.160 --> 11:01.110
with my open-door policy.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.160
Maybe you've made some new enemies.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.160
Enemies in here who are friends
of the criminals out there?

11:10.160 --> 11:13.110
- Are you getting anywhere with
the protected person, sir? - No.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.110
No, and they've made it
very clear that I won't be.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.260
They don't trust us.
We're just the tin hats.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.110
We're on our own, Muriel.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.160
Just you and me.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.110
I told you, Dr Marks, he's a narcissist.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.110
- I'm just trying to take responsibility.
- For my actions!

11:32.160 --> 11:34.110
For crying out loud, Kelsey,
give the man a chance.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.110
- He's come a long way.
- Thank you.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.110
A week ago, he was worried about
me finding out about his girlfriend.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.790
Now he's worried that we're
going to get too close.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.110
I'm just trying not to disappoint you.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.470
- You're just using me as an
excuse, like always. - I don't...

11:46.520 --> 11:48.110
An excuse to move, an excuse to stay,

11:48.160 --> 11:50.950
an excuse to not commit
to the woman you like.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.110
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.520
Urgh...!

11:56.160 --> 11:59.160
All right, I do know what
you're talking about. But...

12:02.160 --> 12:05.110
.. you're not the only one who is
trying to live up to your mother.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.470
Right?

12:06.520 --> 12:09.160
It's hard to compete
with somebody who was...

12:12.360 --> 12:14.160
Yeah?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.110
You just wait for me to
make a mistake, don't you?

12:18.160 --> 12:20.110
Yeah, I do.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.660
And you so rarely disappoint.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.110
What I'm hearing Kelsey say

12:26.160 --> 12:29.110
is that she feels her father
has a problem with commitment.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.110
It's not me. It's the people in my life.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
They either die or try to commit suicide.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.470
Kelsey's right.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.110
You are something of a narcissist.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.310
I don't need to pay to be
insulted. I live in England.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.160
OK, well...

12:53.160 --> 12:55.790
What are you hoping to
get from gawping at them?

12:57.160 --> 13:00.110
I want to know who they are.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.950
Who they were.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.110
Well, erm, they're pretty
rough on the outside.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.110
Er, I'd say they worked outdoors.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.110
Rough on the inside, too.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.110
Three of the livers
show signs of cirrhosis.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.110
So, they're working-class lads who drank.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.110
Sounds like 95% of my Facebook friends.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.470
There is something out of
whack. The schad levels.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.110
Short chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.470
Wow.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.110
You're, like, one voice box
away from Stephen Hawking.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.110
They could speak of high insulin levels.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.110
So, they were diabetic?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.110
Not necessarily.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.760
Abnormal schad levels may just mean
they'd been exposed to extreme cold.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.470
But...

13:37.520 --> 13:40.160
- .. they were burned.
- Maybe they were frozen first.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.110
- So, they could have been killed ages ago.
- No, I don't think so.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.200
Pound coin in this fella's shoe.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.160
- 2019.
- Huh...

13:52.160 --> 13:53.950
He freezes them when he kills them

13:54.000 --> 13:56.110
and then burns them
when the freezer's full.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.110
But I think he enjoys it.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.110
A nail gun to the back
of the head is who he is.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.110
Great. So, why did he show up in my patch?

14:02.160 --> 14:05.110
Lincolnshire is an obvious choice
if you're trying to hide somebody.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.110
Nobody comes round here unless
they want to do a Brexit survey

14:08.160 --> 14:09.630
or run a dodgy medical trial.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.470
Are you house-hunting, sir?

14:11.520 --> 14:14.110
I mean, you don't seem very interested.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.160
- We need to find him.
- I think I just did.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.790
1997, East Lincs Constabulary.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.240
They sold one of their
empty residential units.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.110
The only thing, they
didn't pay the stamp duty.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.950
So?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.110
When one Government agency sells
to another, they don't pay the tax.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.110
Who did we sell it to?

14:33.160 --> 14:35.360
The National Crime Intelligence Service.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.150
They bought Frank a house.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.360
We've got him, sir.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.150
Police! Stay where you are!

14:46.200 --> 14:48.310
Check the back!

14:48.360 --> 14:50.160
Open the door!

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
All clear, sir.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.160
Well, he's long gone.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.110
Now we know why the Home Office
didn't tell us where he was.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.860
They lost track of him a decade ago.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.160
I want this place finger-tip searched.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.110
Fuck me!

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
Sir! Muriel!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.110
My hand just went right through it.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.160
And that...

15:31.200 --> 15:33.160
.. fell out.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.470
Frank McGill was under
the witness protection,

15:40.520 --> 15:43.630
alias of Patrick Shawcross, for ten years.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.110
He had a library card,
joined a snooker club,

15:47.160 --> 15:49.110
registered with a GP.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.110
The neighbours described him
as unremarkable, that he...

15:51.160 --> 15:53.110
- Kept himself to himself.
- Kept himself to himself.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.110
Until he was paid a visit
by our latest victim,

15:57.160 --> 15:59.470
John Paul Cafferky, a Maguire hitman.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.790
So, Frank murdered this
guy, then he done a runner.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.110
So, if the Home Office can't
find him, how the hell will we?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.110
He'll have gone off the grid, won't he?

16:10.160 --> 16:14.110
So, he'll be sticking to cash,
no cards, no phones in his name.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.110
No links to anyone alive.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.110
And that's exactly how
we're going to find him.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.000
And by we, I mean you, Muriel.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.110
All right, check his first name
-- Francis. He may have kept that.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.110
Keep the lie close to the truth.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.110
Check that against population records,

16:37.160 --> 16:39.110
then exclude everybody with a credit card,

16:39.160 --> 16:42.110
phone contract, Netflix account.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.950
26,422.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.110
- That many?
- Mm, we're rural folk.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.950
Farmers hate banks and credit cards.
They hate utility companies, too.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.110
Well, he's got to live somewhere.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.950
Check the Land Registry, post-2002.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.110
We're looking for isolated dwellings,

16:57.160 --> 17:00.110
a thousand feet away from
the nearest neighbour,

17:00.160 --> 17:03.160
far away from any arterial
roads and major intersections.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.160
7,631.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.160
It turns out it's not
that easy to find people.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.160
Hello?

18:02.160 --> 18:04.160
Don't move.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.160
Is there anyone else in this house?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.110
No.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.110
You're a bad liar, which is good to know.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.110
It's a little late for an old
man to be out, isn't it, Frank?

18:15.160 --> 18:17.110
I was never much of a sleeper, me.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.110
Yeah, too many men on your conscience.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.160
Not just men.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.110
You were poking around my old gaff.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.150
Yeah, we thought a nail gun
killer might live there.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.110
And then, lo and behold...

18:29.160 --> 18:32.110
That was the last guy
that was looking for me.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.110
You stay away from me.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.110
Don't look for me.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.110
Don't ask about me.
Don't open my file again.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.150
Or I will come for you
and everyone you know.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.110
You think, by scaring me,

18:44.160 --> 18:46.310
you're going to keep the
police away from you?

18:46.360 --> 18:49.110
You had a chance to live a
straight life, you blew it.

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
I didn't have a chance. My
associates would never let me be.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.110
So, when they came for you, you
put the first one in the wall.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.160
Then you lit the other five on fire.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.110
What the fuck are you talking
about? There was one man.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.630
So, there's another nail gun
psychopath lighting men on fire

19:08.680 --> 19:11.110
- and leaving them in
turkey farms? - Dad?

19:11.160 --> 19:13.000
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody!

19:14.680 --> 19:16.160
I'm on the phone.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.110
You should go to sleep.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.110
Are you going to work all night?

19:23.160 --> 19:25.000
You need to sleep, too.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.160
- I will.
- Erm...

19:29.160 --> 19:31.160
We could talk.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.110
- I can't.
- It's just...

19:36.160 --> 19:37.200
.. I've been selfish.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.840
- If you wanted to talk
about Mom... - Kelsey.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.160
OK. Nice talking to you, too.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.160
Now, you touch one hair on her...

20:24.160 --> 20:27.110
- So, Alex wanted me to go to
his after school today. - Yeah.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.860
- Yeah, I think that
would be good. - OK.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.110
- Kelsey...
- No, I get it, Dad.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.160
You don't want to talk, like, ever.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
If anything were ever to happen to me...

20:43.160 --> 20:44.110
What?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.310
I mean, it is a dangerous job.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.110
Right. Like when a screen falls on you.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.160
How dangerous is a spreadsheet?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.680
Kels...

20:57.160 --> 20:58.160
Kels...

21:01.000 --> 21:02.200
Excuse me, is this yours?

21:04.160 --> 21:06.160
- Yes. Thank you.
- You must have dropped it.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.110
Where's Frank McGill?

21:24.160 --> 21:27.360
Now look what comes onto
your territory, a killer.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.160
And you come to me?

21:31.160 --> 21:34.160
- So, you do know him.
- Yes. I do my job.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.110
I knew when they placed
him here in protection

21:38.160 --> 21:40.110
and I knew when they lost him.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.160
- Where is he now?
- Ah...

21:44.160 --> 21:46.360
They say he does it like that.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.110
To the back of the head.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.160
Ppht!

21:52.160 --> 21:54.110
So they don't get to make
their peace with God.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.150
If he's working for you...

21:56.200 --> 22:00.110
Why would I employ a
70-year-old hitman, huh?

22:00.160 --> 22:03.160
I can hire an Albanian for 120 euro.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.160
Is that all you came for, really?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.520
You don't want to know who
took that little cup...

22:16.160 --> 22:18.360
.. and gave it to
Sergeant Blair's solicitor?

22:19.680 --> 22:21.160
Go on.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.360
It hurts to be betrayed.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.310
Mr Blair, you're being
released on bail of £30,000.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.110
Please register your
address with the clerk.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.160
All rise.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.110
Well, that was uniquely humiliating.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.110
Have you got any idea how
this Blair thing makes me look?

22:55.160 --> 22:56.680
Like a dick again.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.110
Have you ever made a mistake, but
you're in too deep to see a way out?

23:01.160 --> 23:04.110
I've got three of them at home, but
they're too big to put in a sack

23:04.160 --> 23:05.470
and throw in the canal.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.160
You've always been very straight with me.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.110
I appreciate your wise counsel.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.110
You've never listened to a word I've said.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.110
No, I know. But I
appreciate you saying it.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.160
Hixon was a mistake.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.680
The Yank's got to go.
I've learned my lesson.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.160
Local cops for local crime.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.110
The west of the county
is in the shit as well.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.110
So, I was thinking, maybe
we should pool resources.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.110
Bring it all under one roof.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.110
- Are you saying you want me as Chief?
- No, I want Joe Watkins as Chief.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.110
He's got a lot of experience,
hasn't he? He's got...

23:41.160 --> 23:43.110
- A penis.
- Well, yeah.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.110
That is a factor. I mean,
it's not a policy. But it's...

23:46.160 --> 23:49.110
- .. a personal preference, yeah.
- And that makes it OK?

23:49.160 --> 23:52.110
Look, Joe Watkins will
do what he's always done.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.110
He'll look after the west and he'll
let you run this side of the county.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.160
You'll have complete control.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.950
Frank McGill came to your house?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.110
That's the fourth time
you've asked me that.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.110
- And he claims he didn't do it?
- He says.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.110
I wasn't exactly in a
position to argue with him.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.110
Well, it's bullshit, isn't it? He's lying.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.110
Well, let's keep this
between us, all right,

24:18.160 --> 24:21.060
until I can figure out what the
fuck is going on around here.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.110
These are different from the one
you're playing with, aren't they?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.950
How did you know that?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.110
Something a little
birdie told me last night.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.110
Well, my old prof used to say,

24:32.160 --> 24:35.310
"Imagine breaking a bar
of chocolate. Clean snap."

24:35.360 --> 24:38.110
That's what happened to this fella.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.110
He was alive until this
nail so rudely interrupted

24:40.160 --> 24:43.110
the idle musings of his medulla oblongata.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.110
Whereas these guys, crumbly like fudge.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.110
Dead bone crumbles.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.630
So, these guys were dead before.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.470
The nail didn't kill them.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.110
I've got a pretty good idea what did.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.110
Alcoholic livers. Lower body weight.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.790
Significantly lower atherosclerotic grade.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.630
- It's what we see in homeless people.
- You said they were frozen.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.110
When homeless people come
in, no-one to claim them,

25:07.160 --> 25:09.110
they go in the deep freeze.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.110
So, someone took five
bodies from the deep freeze,

25:12.160 --> 25:15.110
put nails in their head and then
burned them in a Lincolnshire field?

25:15.160 --> 25:18.310
Frank wasn't lying. This wasn't him.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.160
Someone's working very hard
to make it look like it was.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.110
We've been through this.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.360
All the Maguires are in
jail or in the ground.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.160
Terence and Pauline's
son, Terry Maguire Junior.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.630
He's 24 years old.

25:34.680 --> 25:38.110
His mother was murdered in a
gang tit for tat when he was two.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.110
- Nice family.
- Terry lives in Birmingham now.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.110
He is becoming something of a
player there himself, apparently.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.110
I spoke to the CIO of Snow Hill Precinct.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.110
They say Terry's a nasty
little psycho, but he's no fool.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.790
Terry's built up his own Maguire firm

25:52.840 --> 25:56.110
with some of the lads he met on the
inside. They're into all sorts.

25:56.160 --> 26:00.110
Armed robberies, drug
distribution, sex trafficking.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.110
And now they're expanding.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.110
So, Junior's trying to accomplish
what his old man never could do.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.110
He's trying to get McGill to break cover.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.110
And it worked, didn't it?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.160
Frank came to your house.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.160
I've seen him before.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.160
Kelsey, your dad's here!

26:26.200 --> 26:29.110
- Those two seem to be getting along.
- Keith wants you out.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.110
Well, Keith wants a
La-Z-Boy for Christmas.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.110
- What do you care?
- Well, why did he want you in?

26:34.160 --> 26:36.110
- You know.
- Yeah. 600 job cuts.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.110
You've gone a bit quiet about that lately.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.110
It turns out we don't
have to cut 600 jobs.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.110
Believe me, it's nothing sentimental.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.110
It's just sound financial planning.
More than sound, actually.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.110
What, you've told Keith?

26:47.160 --> 26:51.110
Cos he wants to merge east and west,
bring in Joe Watkins to run both.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.110
Really? That shit bird?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.110
Well, something stinks.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.110
Yeah, Tredmon Holdings.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.110
Keith has agreed to sell the
whole property portfolio to them.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.110
We don't know who them is.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.950
Well, watch your back,
cos he wants you out.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.310
- That's fine by me.
- Really?

27:05.360 --> 27:08.310
Because I have a funny notion you're
starting to feel at home here.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.950
Thanks, Lydia.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.110
All right, Morticia.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.110
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Not if I see you first.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.160
You two seriously need to grow up.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.110
It's mud.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.110
- What did you want to know?
- Soil content.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.110
Calcides, gypsum, limestone,
basic analytic footprint.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.110
Sure. Come back in a week when I've
sent it to the Forensics Department.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.630
I don't have a week.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.790
- Well, send it to your backstreet
boys like last time. - What?

27:39.840 --> 27:42.310
Well, that's what she said
you did with the coffee cup.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.160
What is this?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.110
Iron, maybe.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.680
Iron salt.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.630
The only place I can think
of with that salinity,

28:00.680 --> 28:02.160
Freiston Salt Marsh.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.160
Hi. I'm sorry, sir. Traffic was a bitch.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.160
Did she have anything for you?

28:17.160 --> 28:18.160
No.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.160
Sir?

28:38.160 --> 28:39.790
Was I expecting you?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.160
I wanted to see you.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.160
Are you all right?

28:46.160 --> 28:48.110
I'm about to do something very stupid.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.160
I'm going to try to find a
psychopath in a salt marsh.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.520
How about don't?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.680
It's so funny how I trust you.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.160
I mean... I only trust you.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.160
You could always just stay here.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.360
I know.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.840
Bill...

29:22.000 --> 29:23.160
Be careful.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Hey, Colin, have you got the stuff?

30:17.160 --> 30:18.110
Yes.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.000
It's all yours, mate.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.520
Cheers.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.110
Mur...? Muriel...?

31:12.160 --> 31:14.160
Fuck.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.110
You came here on your own?

32:03.160 --> 32:05.110
You fucking idiot.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.310
Wait! Wait!

32:06.360 --> 32:09.160
- Someone's trying to frame you.
- No, they're not.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.110
They're trying to find me.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.160
Goddammit!

32:19.160 --> 32:20.360
I'm not used to visitors.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.960
Yes, I saw what you did to the last guy.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.310
JP Cafferky.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.110
Is that why you're here, to arrest me?

32:30.160 --> 32:33.110
And how would that play out?

32:33.160 --> 32:36.110
Well, on the one hand, I'm
approaching threescore and ten.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.110
And on the other, I'm me.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.110
The Maguires set you up.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.110
Terence Maguire is dead. Or as good as.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.110
Not Terence the father.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.160
Terry the son, he is
looking to set you up.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.110
But I can help you if you'll come with me.

32:50.160 --> 32:54.110
I have moved 23 times in ten years.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.160
I am done moving.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.630
I don't want the Maguires
in my territory either.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.110
If young Terence is
anything like his old man,

33:03.160 --> 33:04.790
it'll take more than you to stop him.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.110
Would you stop with the gunslinger shit?

33:07.160 --> 33:10.110
I'm the Chief Constable of a
force of a thousand officers.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.160
In the real world, that's what
we do, we bring criminals in.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.110
I passed a cell tower on my way
here. What's wrong with your signal?

33:18.160 --> 33:20.160
It comes and goes.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.160
Why did you turn on them, the Maguires?

33:32.160 --> 33:34.840
So I could live in the lap of luxury.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.520
It's not a bad set-up.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.110
You've got your solar for hot
water, wind for electricity,

33:41.160 --> 33:45.110
it smells like you've been
running your van on chip oil.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.110
You remind me of the first lad I killed.

33:47.160 --> 33:51.110
- He wouldn't stop talking, neither.
- Your file says you killed seven.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.110
Those are just the ones we know about.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.110
I've told you to stop talking.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.560
Why do you kill them like that?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.160
Haven't you heard?

34:01.160 --> 34:04.160
So they wouldn't have time
to make their peace with God.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.110
It's funny, you don't really
strike me as the religious type.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.110
So, what type do I strike you as?

34:10.159 --> 34:12.840
The type that shoots nails
into people's heads.

34:14.159 --> 34:17.110
- What makes you a cop, hey?
- My dad was a cop.

34:17.159 --> 34:18.159
Oh...

34:19.159 --> 34:22.110
- The old man's footsteps.
- On the contrary.

34:22.159 --> 34:25.630
I thought he was an idiot for
risking his life for 25 grand.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.280
So I went the management route.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.469
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard of.

34:30.520 --> 34:34.159
We haven't spoken in five
years. Even when my wife died.

34:35.159 --> 34:38.520
Our generation knows that
talking doesn't cure anything.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.110
Come with me.

34:43.159 --> 34:45.949
We can prove you didn't
kill those five guys

34:46.000 --> 34:47.630
and the one in your
house was self-defence.

34:47.679 --> 34:51.110
Then you help me find Terry
Maguire. We'll relocate you.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.460
We'll put you somewhere
more... comfortable.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.199
Sure.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.160
Call your guys.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.160
Young Terry's boys cut the mast.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.110
Clever guy. They're coming.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.110
What are you talking about?

35:13.160 --> 35:17.160
They tripped my perimeter
wire 15 minutes after you did.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.110
Where is he?

35:32.160 --> 35:33.110
He's not answering his phone

35:33.160 --> 35:36.110
and he didn't pick up his
daughter from school.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.110
Good things are coming, Muriel.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.160
Great riches.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.110
- And you are a part of it.
- I'm done.

35:45.160 --> 35:48.110
Take my farm if you want.
I won't work for you.

35:48.160 --> 35:51.110
No-one gave me a chance before him.

35:51.160 --> 35:53.110
Not any more.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.110
- He's gone.
- Where?

35:55.160 --> 35:57.260
To Frank? You don't
even know where Frank is.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.160
But you do know where Terry
Maguire is, don't you?

36:04.160 --> 36:08.160
I imagine he went to kill the
man who murdered his mother.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.310
Frank murdered Terry's mother?

36:11.360 --> 36:14.160
Christ, Bill's going
to walk right into it!

36:23.300 --> 36:25.410
Body armour? Are you kidding me?

36:25.460 --> 36:29.410
There's one road into these
woods and one road out.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.410
You can take your chances over the marsh.

36:31.460 --> 36:34.250
So, what's his grudge?

36:34.300 --> 36:36.410
Young Terry has his reasons.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.410
But he was just a baby when you left.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.410
Is it just because you
rooted out his old man?

36:40.460 --> 36:43.770
Terence was the first man who
thought I was any good for anything.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.410
I was on the roof of
his lock-up re-felting.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.410
I'd never seen a rifle, but I was
pretty handy with a nail gun.

36:49.460 --> 36:50.410
Bang!

36:50.460 --> 36:52.410
So, how many? You said not just men.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.140
I mean, I can't imagine you
sneaking up behind a woman.

36:57.660 --> 36:59.410
Who was she?

36:59.460 --> 37:01.460
The only woman I ever loved.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.410
Pauline Maguire?

37:14.460 --> 37:17.300
Terence's mom, she was murdered.

37:20.460 --> 37:22.460
Tell me about Pauline, Frank.

37:24.460 --> 37:27.410
Terence Maguire had no
right to be with her.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.770
She was 15 years younger than him.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.410
The only woman you ever loved

37:31.460 --> 37:33.410
and you fell in love with the boss' wife?

37:33.460 --> 37:35.410
Why did you kill her?

37:35.460 --> 37:38.300
Why did you do it? Did she go back to him?

37:39.460 --> 37:41.410
You couldn't have her, then nobody could?

37:41.460 --> 37:44.460
It's no wonder Terry
Maguire wants you dead.

37:48.460 --> 37:51.410
Terry Maguire, I know where I saw him.

37:51.460 --> 37:55.460
It was out the front of my
daughter's school. He gave me this.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.410
Shit.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.460
He put a tracker on it.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.460
He's coming to kill you.

38:11.460 --> 38:14.410
Sean, I think the Chief's in
danger. Something is going down.

38:14.460 --> 38:18.460
Whoa, what are you talking about,
Muriel? What the fuck's going on?

38:28.460 --> 38:30.460
What is it?

38:31.460 --> 38:33.660
It's a feeling I've had since I arrived.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.460
That I was brought here to fail.

38:38.460 --> 38:41.410
Well, as they used to say in
The Brothers, que es bono?

38:41.460 --> 38:42.820
Who benefits?

38:44.460 --> 38:46.410
They're merging the force.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.410
They're selling all the properties.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.410
Jesus fucking Christ, they're
going to make a fortune,

38:51.460 --> 38:53.770
- Krasnov and his friends.
- If they get rid of you.

38:53.820 --> 38:57.300
Maybe I'm not the only one
who's meant to die here.

38:58.460 --> 38:59.460
That's what's coming.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.410
100 metres.

39:04.460 --> 39:08.460
Any minute now, young Maguire will
be walking up to my front door.

39:09.980 --> 39:13.410
Like you said, he has a good
reason. You killed his mother.

39:13.460 --> 39:14.460
McGill!

39:16.300 --> 39:17.410
McGill!

39:17.460 --> 39:19.250
Come out here!

39:19.300 --> 39:22.410
I mean, come on, Frank, 20 years
ago, you wouldn't be sitting here

39:22.460 --> 39:24.410
waiting for the Maguires
to come and get you.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.410
What happened?

39:26.460 --> 39:28.460
What changed?

39:29.660 --> 39:31.410
Pauline happened.

39:31.460 --> 39:37.250
She wanted me to turn myself
in and face the consequences.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.410
You would have gone to prison for her?

39:39.460 --> 39:42.460
I would have gone anywhere
for her. I wish I had.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.300
Terence found out about us.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.460
Terence killed her?

39:53.460 --> 39:55.930
Terry thinks you killed his
mom. You've got to tell him.

39:55.980 --> 39:58.410
That young man is a fucking psychopath.

39:58.460 --> 40:03.410
He put a grenade down a young
lad's jumper and pulled the pin.

40:03.460 --> 40:05.160
You thought the old man was mad...

40:07.460 --> 40:09.250
Come on, Frank!

40:09.300 --> 40:11.460
Frank, tell him. You can't win this.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.460
Good luck, copper.

40:15.460 --> 40:18.410
When the shooting starts,
head for the woods.

40:18.460 --> 40:19.460
Frank, come out!

40:20.460 --> 40:21.410
Come out here!

40:22.960 --> 40:23.760
Shit.

40:24.980 --> 40:28.410
- He won't come out.
- Let him have it, lads.

40:29.980 --> 40:31.460
Frank!

40:51.460 --> 40:52.660
Frank?

41:01.140 --> 41:02.460
Frank?

41:17.300 --> 41:18.460
Jesus, Frank.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.460
Frank...?

41:43.460 --> 41:47.460
If only I'd got him and Pauline
out of there, like I promised.

41:51.460 --> 41:53.460
Terry's your son.

41:54.460 --> 41:55.410
I made him.

41:55.460 --> 41:57.410
And I killed him.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.460
I had to.

42:00.460 --> 42:02.410
Before he killed some other mother's son.

42:02.460 --> 42:04.460
What have I done?

42:06.460 --> 42:07.820
He'd come to kill you.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.760
He would've killed me, too.

42:12.460 --> 42:15.410
Terence Maguire did see something in me.

42:15.460 --> 42:17.410
He saw a killer.

42:17.460 --> 42:19.300
And he was right.

42:23.460 --> 42:24.770
We tried.

42:24.820 --> 42:26.460
It's OK.

42:29.460 --> 42:30.410
It looks bad.

42:30.460 --> 42:32.410
They saw something in you, too.

42:32.460 --> 42:34.140
What was it?

42:35.300 --> 42:37.770
My father told me the day I left
home I'd get what I was worthy of.

42:37.820 --> 42:39.410
Ah...

42:39.460 --> 42:42.460
Well, they were right about
both of us, then, hey?

42:43.460 --> 42:46.460
I was happy on that roof.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.410
Who said we had to be something?

42:49.460 --> 42:51.460
The view...

42:52.460 --> 42:54.460
.. was good enough...

42:55.460 --> 42:56.660
.. from there.

43:41.820 --> 43:44.410
How much money were you
going to make on the deal?

43:44.460 --> 43:46.410
I don't know what you're talking about.

43:46.460 --> 43:48.410
I thought Tredmon Holdings

43:48.460 --> 43:50.410
was a perfectly legitimate
corporate interest.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.410
One that was going to line your pocket.

43:52.460 --> 43:54.460
How much was your kickback worth?

43:57.460 --> 43:59.610
You never really got this
place, did you, Bill, hey?

43:59.660 --> 44:02.410
It's ancient rhythms.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.460
You never should have hired me, Keith.

44:05.460 --> 44:07.460
I'll get Krasnov.

44:08.460 --> 44:10.410
And then I'm coming for his friends.

44:10.460 --> 44:13.410
I had no idea anyone was
going to get hurt, Bill.

44:13.460 --> 44:16.410
But it sounds to me like
you had a lucky escape.

44:16.460 --> 44:19.410
Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

44:19.460 --> 44:23.410
You always gave me the impression
that this place was beneath you.

44:23.460 --> 44:24.610
To the contrary.

44:24.660 --> 44:26.930
I kind of like the view.

44:26.980 --> 44:29.300
You can see for miles.

44:49.460 --> 44:50.660
So, how do I look?

44:52.460 --> 44:54.410
- Alex is a lucky guy.
- Urgh, no.

44:54.460 --> 44:55.410
Not that.

44:55.460 --> 44:58.410
- I'm running for the
school's eco committee. - Oh!

44:58.460 --> 45:01.410
Well, you're a true Hixon.

45:01.460 --> 45:03.460
Does it come with a corner office?

45:09.460 --> 45:11.410
I was a shitty husband.

45:11.460 --> 45:13.460
You know that, right?

45:15.300 --> 45:17.460
Yeah, you're a shitty dad, too.

45:18.460 --> 45:19.980
But you're my shitty dad.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.450
It's a miserable place, isn't it, Dad?

45:26.500 --> 45:29.460
A miserable place for miserable people.
