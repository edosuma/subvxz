00:32.500 --> 00:33.401
GRACE:
Hey, it's me.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.402
Don't leave a message.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.769
Text me.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.638
(footsteps approaching)

00:53.221 --> 00:55.189
YOUNG WOMAN:
I'm sorry.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.490
She's not here.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.392
I talked to the other girls

00:58.426 --> 01:00.161
and no one's seen
her since lunch.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.062
Okay. Thanks.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.615
GRACE:
You can't come up with me.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.251
You're gonna get me
in trouble, Noah. Stop.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.186
RYAN:
Grace?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.188
Avery.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.157
Oh, my God, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

01:29.190 --> 01:29.890
I'm late for dinner.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.891
Let me just grab my stuff

01:30.924 --> 01:32.626
and then we...
we can go.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.129
We can reschedule.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.264
Whoa.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.765
Are you okay?
Yeah.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.300
Yeah, I'm fine, I just... I...

01:39.333 --> 01:41.135
I forgot what time it was.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.504
I should
probably change.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.538
It'll only take a minute.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.174
Honey, it's fine.

01:46.207 --> 01:49.210
Why don't you just stay here
tonight with your friends?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.811
God, I'm so embarrassed.

01:50.844 --> 01:51.879
(phone chimes)

01:51.912 --> 01:53.881
Oh, see-- we would have been
interrupted anyway.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.916
This is work. Um...

01:55.949 --> 01:57.318
I need to go.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.253
But we'll have dinner
next week, okay?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.788
Okay.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.223
God, I'm so sorry.
No...

02:08.562 --> 02:11.332
*

02:11.365 --> 02:13.567
I received a ViCAP alert.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.370
A murder victim's fingerprints
matched to a convicted hacker.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.606
Quinn Elliot.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.807
Queen of Hearts?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.175
She... she's dead?

02:21.209 --> 02:23.844
We're here to
recover her phone.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.214
Thank you for delaying
the autopsy, Dr. Macy.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.449
MACY:
Of course.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.218
But, uh, considering
the condition of her body,

02:30.251 --> 02:31.452
I don't think you'll have
much luck with her cell.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.454
KRUMITZ:
Ugh...

02:34.988 --> 02:37.291
Why did D.B. have to testify
in Vegas this week?

02:37.325 --> 02:39.260
I don't do dead bodies.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.228
He does dead bodies.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.729
He's done
a bunch of them.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.364
He literally talks
about it all the time.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.865
He kind of brags about it,
have you noticed that?

02:44.898 --> 02:46.267
You'll be fine, Krummy.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.536
Transfer everything
you recover off that phone

02:48.569 --> 02:49.770
to CTOC ASAP.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.940
Gloves?

02:52.973 --> 02:55.175
*

03:17.531 --> 03:19.633
(computer beeps)

03:19.667 --> 03:21.469
Looks like someone found
Quinn Elliot before we did.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.537
Yeah. So much for
long live the queen.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.240
I always felt invincible
behind my computer screen.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.876
Your devices
aren't bulletproof,

03:28.909 --> 03:30.278
and hacking
the wrong person

03:30.311 --> 03:31.345
is a chance every
black hat takes.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.715
We need to figure out
what Quinn was working on.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.284
If someone went to the trouble

03:36.317 --> 03:37.585
of tracking her down
and killing her,

03:37.618 --> 03:40.254
who knows what kind of
hack we'll uncover?

03:40.288 --> 03:42.356
MUNDO: Well, that means
a long list of suspects.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.526
'Cause pretty much anyone
Quinn ever hacked has motive.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.361
She was a convicted
hacker for hire.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.896
Was imprisoned three years ago
for hacking the Port of Seattle.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.698
Made several containers of drugs

03:50.731 --> 03:52.366
disappear
from shipping manifests.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.403
Well, Quinn was a suspect
in nine open cases.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.404
Variety of charges:

03:56.437 --> 03:57.905
DDoS'ing Web sites,

03:57.938 --> 04:00.941
uncovering hidden assets
in high-profile divorces,

04:00.974 --> 04:03.844
doxxing politicians.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.314
All of this stuff happened
before she was locked up.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.648
Yeah, it says
she was released

04:07.681 --> 04:08.782
just over a year ago.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.784
But her parole officer
lost track of her.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.952
She's been off
the grid ever since.

04:11.985 --> 04:12.953
MUNDO: Did someone
wait patiently

04:12.986 --> 04:14.388
to seek their revenge?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.823
Or did Quinn go back
to her black hat ways

04:15.856 --> 04:18.326
and piss off someone else?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.428
Let's ask our only eyewitness:
Quinn's phone.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.795
It knows where
she's been,

04:21.829 --> 04:23.464
who she was with
and what she was planning next.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.965
A digital record
of her every move.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.334
We'll question Quinn's phone

04:26.367 --> 04:27.067
to find out who killed her.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.370
*

04:58.732 --> 05:01.034
*

05:07.908 --> 05:11.412
RAMIREZ: A watched progress
bar never uploads.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.646
Yeah. Can't help it.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.382
I mean, we're usually
chasing a screen name

05:14.415 --> 05:15.315
trying to find
the hacker.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.484
We never start out
knowing who they are,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.486
let alone have
their phone.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.520
(computer chimes)

05:21.655 --> 05:23.056
NELSON: We just got
an all-access pass

05:23.090 --> 05:24.057
to our hacker's life.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.360
Krumitz just sent
an image of Quinn's phone.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.562
RYAN: Let's see what the
Queen of Hearts was up to.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.964
Okay, Quinn activated
her virtual assistant

05:30.998 --> 05:34.067
at 7:57 p.m. the night
she was murdered.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.636
Well, the coroner put
the time of death

05:35.669 --> 05:37.104
between 6:00 and 8:00.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.672
Those are Quinn's last words.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.540
Can we recover them?

05:39.573 --> 05:42.610
RAMIREZ:
Dirty little secret about Isla:

05:42.643 --> 05:44.978
phone manufacturers
save everything users say

05:45.012 --> 05:47.415
to their virtual assistant
for at least two years.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.783
I can call the DOJ
and get a subpoena.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.821
What is it? What's wrong?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.123
These apps, they're weak.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.625
No Deep Web browser,

05:57.658 --> 05:58.859
no Bluetooth sniffer,
no Wi-Fi cracker.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.160
I mean, this phone

06:00.193 --> 06:01.895
could belong to anyone
except a hacker.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.731
No, no. Wait... wait, wait.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.533
You notice anything
about the calculator?

06:05.566 --> 06:07.100
Well, the file size
is much larger

06:07.134 --> 06:08.602
than the other apps.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.603
NELSON:
That's a gatekeeper.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.904
If we enter a passcode

06:10.938 --> 06:12.072
into the calculator's keypad,

06:12.105 --> 06:13.474
it opens up a hidden partition.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.842
This is a phone within a phone.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.945
It's a perfect place
to hide data.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.113
Mm-hmm.
Whatever's inside
that hidden partition

06:20.147 --> 06:22.550
could tell us everything
we need to know about Quinn.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.851
Break into it.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.853
And then meet me
in CTOC.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.088
Don't look at me--
I don't know how to do it.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.925
(phone line ringing)

06:31.959 --> 06:33.594
Go for Krummy.
Hey, Krummy.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.595
What's up?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.163
Yeah, man, um...

06:36.196 --> 06:39.467
we need to know how to crack
into a hacker's passcode.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.201
I got the IMEI number

06:41.234 --> 06:43.437
off Quinn's phone from Krumitz.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
It's registered
to a Lexie James.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.207
An alias?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.510
Yeah. Apparently,
Lexie or Quinn

06:49.543 --> 06:50.878
was married to a Louis James
about nine months ago.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.146
Metro PD is making
the notification right now.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.582
RAMIREZ:
The DOJ came through.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.617
So I'm downloading
Quinn Elliot's Isla log

06:56.650 --> 06:58.519
from the phone manufacturer.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.687
It's an audio file.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.089
Okay.
Here we go.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.090
(whimpering)

07:08.662 --> 07:11.865
ISLA (electronic voice):
Hello, what can I help you with?

07:11.899 --> 07:12.933
E-mail. Photo.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.535
2-2-6.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.070
ISLA: You want me
to e-mail a photo? Sure.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.640
To whom would you like
to send photo 2-2-6?

07:19.673 --> 07:20.874
(gunshots)

07:20.908 --> 07:24.545
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.378
MUNDO:
Wait, so the last thing

07:25.412 --> 07:26.780
Quinn tried to do
before she died

07:26.814 --> 07:27.815
was e-mail a photo?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.483
Why not dial 911?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.651
RAMIREZ:
This is photo 2-2-6.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.219
RYAN:
"Drowning. Yielding.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.755
"Grasping. Scarring.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.223
I gave in.
I won't give up."

07:36.256 --> 07:37.891
Looks like an Instagram post.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.693
No, it's not.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.661
Hold on.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.795
It's from this Web site.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.030
MUNDO:
"Miafina"?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.231
RAMIREZ:
Means "secret" in Malagasy.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.500
This site is where
users anonymously post

07:46.534 --> 07:48.502
their deepest, darkest secrets.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.003
Anyone can read them.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.905
It's addictive.
Total click bait.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.741
Photo 2-2-6 is a confession.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.975
See?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.944
It's got the same purple
borders as all of these.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.945
NELSON:
Whoa.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.146
"I'm addicted to heroin.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.048
I'm a third-grade teacher."

08:01.081 --> 08:02.115
RAMIREZ:
"Helpless. Alone. Afraid.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.216
What a difference
a month makes."

08:03.250 --> 08:06.520
These confessions are either
super shocking or vague.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.055
"I told my mom
I was going on a diet.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.723
I'm really anorexic."

08:09.757 --> 08:12.092
Why would anybody post
anything so personal?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.927
It's cathartic,
impersonal.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.563
Often the easiest person to tell

08:15.596 --> 08:16.764
a secret to
is a stranger.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.533
RAMIREZ: This site has
12 million users

08:19.567 --> 08:20.734
from all over the world.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.069
That's a lot of strangers.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.605
Is photo 2-2-6
Quinn's confession?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.207
Raven, separate the text

08:27.240 --> 08:28.576
from the image.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.243
MUNDO:
All right, a couple letters

08:30.277 --> 08:31.812
are randomly capitalized.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.046
Pull them together.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.282
MUNDO:
Doesn't make sense.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.650
Wait a minute,
look at it backwards.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.818
R-A-P-E-D.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.087
"Raped.
I won't give up."

08:40.120 --> 08:42.122
Was Quinn a rape victim?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.324
Raven, can you find this
confession on the site?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.893
RAMIREZ:
No, it's not here.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.563
But the purple border
means that it was posted.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.698
Maybe she had
second thoughts

08:50.731 --> 08:53.033
about sharing her secret
and deleted it.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.135
No, the language suggests that
she wasn't going to stay quiet.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.270
MUNDO: "I won't give up"
in all caps.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.338
Maybe she was planning
on going to the cops.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.808
Or to confront
her attacker--

09:00.841 --> 09:02.710
which could have
resulted in her death.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.545
Our suspect pool
just got even bigger.

09:11.384 --> 09:17.324
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

09:19.627 --> 09:25.799
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

09:25.833 --> 09:29.136
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:29.169 --> 09:33.173
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:33.206 --> 09:37.244
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:37.277 --> 09:41.014
* And miles...

09:41.048 --> 09:42.049
* Oh, yeah.

10:00.834 --> 10:01.969
RYAN: Thank you for
taking the time

10:02.002 --> 10:03.671
to meet with us,
Mr. James.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.839
I know that this is a very
difficult time for you.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.140
I don't understand

10:07.174 --> 10:08.608
why someone would want
to kill Lexie.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.681
Uh, Mr. James, there's
something you should know

10:13.714 --> 10:14.815
about your wife.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.116
Her real name
was Quinn Elliot.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.918
Excuse me?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.687
RYAN:
Your wife, Lexie,

10:19.720 --> 10:20.821
was living a dual life.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.823
She was
a convicted hacker,

10:22.856 --> 10:24.858
she had outstanding warrants,

10:24.892 --> 10:27.695
she was living under an alias
to avoid detection.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.729
No.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.430
You've obviously made a mistake.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.433
Lexie was a software engineer.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.868
Her fingerprints
are in our system

10:34.902 --> 10:36.136
under the name Quinn Elliot.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.839
Now, we think she
may have been killed

10:38.872 --> 10:41.408
because of something
she was hacking.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.011
I'm gonna need to confiscate
the devices from your home.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.680
Do what you want,

10:46.714 --> 10:48.348
but she would've told me.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.183
Lexie and I didn't
lie to each other.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.151
This is absurd.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.787
Mr. James,
I have to ask you

10:53.821 --> 10:57.090
a very difficult question.

10:57.124 --> 11:01.094
Did Lexie ever talk to you
about being sexually assaulted?

11:01.128 --> 11:02.362
What?!

11:02.395 --> 11:04.131
No.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.265
No, it...

11:05.298 --> 11:07.034
She isn't who you think she is.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.336
I know it seems
like I didn't

11:09.369 --> 11:12.039
know my wife at all,
but I would know

11:12.072 --> 11:14.041
if Lexie had been...

11:15.909 --> 11:17.878
We were planning a family.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.848
Saving to buy a home.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.283
You're wasting your time,
Agent Ryan.

11:23.316 --> 11:27.187
And instead of accusing Lexie
of some false identity scam,

11:27.220 --> 11:29.156
saying these awful things,
you should be searching

11:29.189 --> 11:32.893
for the psychopath
who killed my wife.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.996
Did you see what he did to her?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.464
I'm not gonna be able
to help you.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.699
I'm sorry.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.742
(groans)

11:50.911 --> 11:53.146
(Nelson whoops)

11:53.180 --> 11:55.215
Check out the moves
on this baby!

11:55.248 --> 11:56.984
This brute force bot

11:57.017 --> 11:59.186
is grinding through 72
potential passcodes per minute,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.154
trying to crack
into Quinn's hidden partition.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.322
Hey, don't touch it.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.324
I don't want to have
to start over.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.293
We're lucky that this calculator
app only accepts numbers.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.028
No letters or symbols means

12:08.061 --> 12:09.897
there's only about 10 billion
possible combinations.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.232
Yeah, but Quinn programmed
the calculator to overwrite

12:12.265 --> 12:14.301
the hidden partition if it
senses a forensic tool.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.237
Now, are you sure we're
not gonna lose everything.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.406
No, the bot replicates
the action of entering a code.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.309
It stopped.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.444
All right, we're in.
All right, cool!

12:24.477 --> 12:26.079
Send the data to CTOC
and I'll meet you there.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.186
(whoops)
This is a sick hacker's toolbox.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.487
A Wi-Fi password cracker?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.423
Blackshades command and control?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.358
I've never seen this PIN
testing tool before but...

12:38.391 --> 12:40.027
Nelson, check it out.
Yeah.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.428
She's got
a ToggleFly exploit,

12:41.461 --> 12:44.231
which means that the site
is an easy target.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.899
That could be worth
some serious cash.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.134
I know hackers who
would do anything

12:47.167 --> 12:48.235
to get their hands on that.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.203
Is that what I think it is?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.272
May I present Quinn Elliot,

12:52.305 --> 12:54.141
hidden partition and all.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.809
RYAN: That leaves
only one question.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.578
Was Quinn killed by someone
in her cyber world

12:58.611 --> 12:59.913
or her real world?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.314
Well, it looks like she logged

13:01.348 --> 13:04.284
into a coffee shop's
open Wi-Fi network every day.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.486
Hackers use open networks
to stay anonymous.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.421
They're the sharks
in open Wi-Fi water.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.523
That's why so many people
get hacked in coffee shops.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.392
Maybe Quinn was hacking.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.995
Okay, think I might
have something here.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.329
RYAN: Shield Wallet.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.931
Hackers for hire
use it to accept

13:17.965 --> 13:19.432
anonymous payments
from their clients.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.968
Can't be tracked.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.469
Quinn was loaded.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.471
She's got half a mil here.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.374
Her husband said they were
saving up to buy a house.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.843
He had no idea she was
stashing all this money away.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.980
Last payment she received was
for $25,000, eight days ago.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.848
Our hacker for hire
was back in business.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.887
Why would she hide the Miafina
app behind the partition?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.288
Yeah, well, it looks
like Quinn was hired

13:41.321 --> 13:43.490
to hack the site Miafina
a week ago.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.560
She found a backdoor
and identified

13:47.594 --> 13:48.862
who posted every secret.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.563
And look at all those names.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.033
RAMIREZ: What people thought
was anonymous is no longer.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.002
Hi, honey.
Hey.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.069
Sorry I'm late.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.170
Beltway was backed up.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.939
It's okay.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.041
RYAN:
This is a massive data dump.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.542
This is Ashley Madison
all over again.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.979
Blackmailing users
with the juiciest secrets,

14:06.013 --> 14:07.547
threatening to reveal
their names.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.781
This is a big payday.

14:08.815 --> 14:11.018
Or go straight to the top--
hold the Miafina site hostage.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.552
But Quinn didn't do any of that.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.987
The only thing that she did

14:14.021 --> 14:15.422
was delete her secret.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.457
Users can delete
their own confessions.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.392
You'd only need

14:19.426 --> 14:21.061
to hack the site

14:21.094 --> 14:22.629
if you were deleting
someone else's secret.

14:22.662 --> 14:26.499
So maybe the confession
we recovered wasn't Quinn's.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.535
Use the Lookback Machine
to track it.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.609
Okay, it was posted
November 18.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.145
And deleted November 26.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.080
Here's a screenshot

14:40.113 --> 14:42.349
of the confession
as it appeared online.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.317
Our confession was posted from
the Paxton University campus

14:44.351 --> 14:46.686
on November 18, 5:17 a.m.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.256
So it's possible a student

14:49.289 --> 14:51.424
at Paxton University was raped.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.561
She used Miafina
to threaten her rapist,

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
then Quinn was hired
to silence our rape victim.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.676
A sexual assault victim
at Paxton University

15:09.709 --> 15:12.479
posted this secret
on November 18,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.181
right in the Red Zone.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.116
The "Red Zone" as in football?

15:16.149 --> 15:16.950
No.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.585
On college campuses,
the "Red Zone"

15:18.618 --> 15:21.154
is the time in-between
new student orientation

15:21.188 --> 15:22.622
and the Thanksgiving break,
when students

15:22.655 --> 15:25.092
are at greatest risk
for sexual assault.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.127
So, instead of fixing
the problem, they named it.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.561
Incredible.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.563
We need to find out
who posted that secret.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.199
All right, well,

15:32.232 --> 15:33.733
we can use Quinn's backdoor
to get a list of all confessions

15:33.766 --> 15:35.635
with a Paxton University geotag.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.605
I'll reach out to campus
security, metro PD,

15:38.638 --> 15:40.640
cross-reference those
confessions with reports

15:40.673 --> 15:41.441
of sexual assault on campus.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.709
That might lead us
to our victim.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.378
Make sure they know this case
stays under our jurisdiction.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.581
Someone hired a hacker
to cover up a rape.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.717
We started this,
we're gonna finish it.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.951
You got it.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.325
Hey, do you know
what "S-O-T" means?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.692
Yeah, "screen on time"?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.528
Amount of time your
cell phone screen is lit up.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.596
No, I don't think
that's what this is.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.498
I'm trying to figure out
why Quinn hacked Miafina.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.167
Mm-hmm.
And this is the database

16:07.200 --> 16:09.402
of new words logged by the
cell's dynamic dictionary.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.439
And my phone finally stopped
changing "Krummy" to "tummy."

16:12.472 --> 16:15.042
So?
So the last word that
Quinn's phone learned

16:15.075 --> 16:16.743
Mm-hmm?
was "SOT."

16:16.776 --> 16:18.611
You search it?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.180
Unless Quinn recently became
a "sot" which is defined

16:20.213 --> 16:22.182
as a "habitual drunkard"
or visited a village

16:22.215 --> 16:24.084
in Serbia named Sot,
we're out of luck.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.418
Okay.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.520
So, let's write a script
to search the phone's

16:27.554 --> 16:29.656
hard drive
for the origin of "SOT."

16:29.689 --> 16:32.425
Um... just put in that.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.294
All right... (muttering)

16:34.327 --> 16:37.097
You miss being a black hat?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.698
(chuckles)

16:40.200 --> 16:41.634
I miss the rush.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.470
You know that moment
right before you execute?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.472
You have no idea
what's gonna happen next?

16:45.505 --> 16:48.341
I mean, the hacks I knew
I shouldn't have been doing.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.676
That was like--
Sex.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.378
Oh, it was way better than sex,
come on now.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.214
No.
Oh.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.549
I mean, not-not better
than with you, just...

16:56.583 --> 16:58.118
Right.
like, in the abstract.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.287
Uh-huh. Nice save.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.554
(laughing)

17:02.589 --> 17:05.792
What was your most
dangerous hack?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.627
I was living in New York.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.263
I used to eat at this bomb
Thai spot, right?

17:10.297 --> 17:11.664
Called Thai Delight.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.566
They had killer pad Thai.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.436
Thing was no one
was ever in this place.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.238
So I was curious
how they were paying their rent

17:18.271 --> 17:20.373
and they literally had
no network security.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.542
So I snuck a peek
at their books.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.711
Come to find out they were
a front for the Thai Mob.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.114
Now, the second
I accessed the network,

17:27.147 --> 17:29.716
I had, like, six huge guys
coming at me, right?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.319
So, you know me, I'm fighting
them off, one-by-one.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.388
I took one of them-- boom,

17:35.422 --> 17:38.091
threw him through a table--

17:38.125 --> 17:40.260
Nelson, stop lying.
Yes, I did.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.561
You ran!

17:41.594 --> 17:42.795
NELSON:
Damn.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.231
Faster than I ever did.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.299
(Nelson and Ramirez
laughing)

17:46.333 --> 17:48.101
You're an idiot.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.769
You know that's why
you're so into me.

17:49.802 --> 17:50.737
Mm-hmm.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.439
All right, now your turn.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.740
What's your most dangerous hack?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.542
I'm not telling.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.809
Come on.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.779
You can post on Miafina, but you
can't share your secret with me?

17:59.812 --> 18:02.749
See, I only read
other people's confessions.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.750
Ah.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.684
Mm-hmm.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.354
I never post.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.389
(laughs)

18:11.924 --> 18:14.527
So I called Paxton
University to get a list

18:14.561 --> 18:17.530
of all sexual assault incidents
reported on campus last year.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.432
Their number was zero.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.867
That is virtually impossible.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.204
One in five young women are
sexually assaulted in college.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.873
Clearly they're underreporting
to keep their crime stats down.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.840
Protect their image.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.709
It's despicable.

18:29.742 --> 18:30.910
NELSON:
Avery?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.245
Check it out--
we figured out

18:32.279 --> 18:33.580
who hired Quinn to hack Miafina.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.847
She started
talking to someone

18:34.881 --> 18:37.584
with the handle
SOT515 nine days ago

18:37.617 --> 18:38.851
on an encrypted messaging app.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.019
There's their first
conversation.

18:40.052 --> 18:43.356
Quinn was hired to delete
the confession we recovered.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.860
And locate and spy on the person
who posted it-- Shelby Lockhart

18:47.894 --> 18:50.663
SOT515 is a rapist,

18:50.697 --> 18:51.831
who's searching for his victim.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.900
We need to find Shelby
before he does.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.636
Go to their last conversation.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.770
All right.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.206
Maybe Quinn gave him
Shelby's location.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.607
Nothing like
that, but...

19:00.640 --> 19:02.509
Whoa.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.644
Quinn quit working for SOT515.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.446
She refused to continue
to spy on Shelby.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.880
Said that she was
gonna tell the world

19:07.914 --> 19:10.517
what a disgusting,
vile human being he is.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.452
I mean, that's bold.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.753
That is motive.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.422
Quinn quit her hacking job.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.924
She threatened to expose SOT515.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.459
He may have killed Quinn.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.660
Mm-hmm.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.429
And when he asked
to meet Quinn in person,

19:22.462 --> 19:24.364
wanted to make a deal,
Quinn agreed to meet him.

19:24.397 --> 19:28.368
But hackers for hire never meet
their client in person.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.902
Maintaining anonymity is
the cardinal rule of hacking.

19:29.936 --> 19:30.903
I mean, come on,

19:30.937 --> 19:33.373
Quinn would never agree
to a real-world meeting.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.408
But she did.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.846
We need to find out why she met
with her killer in person.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.548
I'll meet you in CTOC.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.316
(indistinct chatter)

19:48.355 --> 19:49.556
RYAN:
Nelson was right.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.792
Quinn agreed to meet Mr. 515
the night that she was killed.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.328
He's our prime suspect
in this murder.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.764
Where are we at with finding
our rape victim Shelby Lockhart?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.866
Her phone's been
offline for a week.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.702
No missing person reports
on campus or with metro PD,

20:02.735 --> 20:04.837
but I have not been able
to reach her parents.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.006
Okay, well, this is what
Shelby Lockhart looks like.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.010
Her FriendAgenda has not been
updated for over a week.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.780
You think that 515 killed Quinn
to keep her from exposing him,

20:13.813 --> 20:14.881
then went after
Shelby Lockhart?

20:14.914 --> 20:17.016
Until we find Shelby,
that's our operating theory.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.287
Still no info on SOT515.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.854
I searched with and social media
user with that handle.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.556
I got nothing.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.857
All right, this guy went
through a lot of trouble

20:24.891 --> 20:26.426
to delete Shelby's
confession, right?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.827
Now, at first blush,

20:27.860 --> 20:29.629
it just looks
like a cryptic poem.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.564
But what about it made him
go to such extremes?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.733
Well, the guilty see

20:33.766 --> 20:34.934
evidence of their crime
everywhere they look.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.670
To him, this was
broadcasting the rape.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.741
Raven, can you enlarge
Shelby's confession image?

20:41.774 --> 20:44.544
So the images underneath the
secrets are just as revealing

20:44.577 --> 20:45.778
as the text.

20:45.812 --> 20:46.946
Why chose this picture?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
MUNDO:
It's pretty abstract.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.317
I'm not sure it is.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.984
Draws your eye upwards.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.953
There's a structure.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.023
Raven, can you rotate it
180 degrees?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.791
NELSON:
Whoa, that's crazy.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.660
Boats-- SOT5!

21:00.693 --> 21:02.729
Sprint of the Five Mile--
look it up.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.797
Okay, it's a row team race
that happens once a year

21:04.831 --> 21:08.468
on the Five Mile River
in Boston.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.969
KRUMITZ:
Yeah, happens in October.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.671
This year
the Paxton University crew team

21:11.704 --> 21:13.039
won the whole thing.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.807
Hey, well, check it out.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.943
They have a photo album
of the celebration party.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.746
Hey, Avery, is that Grace?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.748
RYAN: She's with her friend.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.416
They must have gone
to the celebration party.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.786
Wait, stop, stop!
Behind those guys

21:26.819 --> 21:28.721
standing at the pool table.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.723
That painting is at
the crew team house.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.925
It's time we paid
that crew a visit.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.804
Paxton University crew team.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.073
My name is Agent Mundo of the
FBI. This is Deputy Director...

21:47.106 --> 21:49.509
Ryan? Julian Perkins.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.678
Paxton University
Athletic Director.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.680
Campus security alerted
me to your visit.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.782
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.017
We have a warrant to search the
crew team's electronic devices.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.852
We have reason to believe

21:59.886 --> 22:02.021
one of them
is a rapist and a murderer.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.024
MUNDO: The assault victim
is currently missing.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.359
This is ridiculous.

22:06.393 --> 22:09.462
You can't just come in here and
make those kind of accusations.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.863
Do you even have any proof?
It's an
ongoing investigation.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.765
You don't get to
ask that question.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.033
Who are you to say that?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.702
Finn, that's enough.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.470
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.606
I'll handle this.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.040
(sighs)
This is not the first time

22:21.073 --> 22:22.942
that one of my athletes
has been wrongly accused

22:22.975 --> 22:24.911
of sexual assault.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.914
These lies ruin reputations.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.982
Fewer than ten percent of
all rape accusations are false.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.183
That statistic,

22:31.217 --> 22:34.454
Agent Ryan, has nothing to do
with these fine young men.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.924
Not one of them
is capable of rape or murder.

22:37.957 --> 22:38.891
If you're so sure
they're innocent,

22:38.925 --> 22:40.059
the devices will prove it.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.561
You won't be taking
their devices.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.863
According to university counsel,

22:43.896 --> 22:46.499
their computers, phones,
their tablets,

22:46.533 --> 22:48.134
they're all protected under
the Family Educational Rights

22:48.167 --> 22:50.670
and Privacy Act.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.105
They contain confidential
student records.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.774
We're not interested
in their calculus scores.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.543
We're looking for evidence
in a criminal investigation.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.578
As you know,
the law's the law.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.747
The only way you can have access
to their devices

23:00.780 --> 23:02.782
is if you obtain consent

23:02.815 --> 23:05.918
or probable cause
for an arrest.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.855
Your warrant is useless.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.823
We will find out
what happened here.

23:10.857 --> 23:11.858
You can't
protect them forever.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.577
RYAN:
I need to get access

23:30.610 --> 23:32.945
to the crew team's devices,
Mason.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.181
(sighs) We need to get
around this legal loophole.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.649
I'm hunting a rapist.

23:36.683 --> 23:37.617
It's not that simple, Avery.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.118
I can't just get around
a FERPA violation.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.854
Obtaining university records
is dicey territory.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.990
Those devices contain the
oarsmen's class schedules,

23:44.023 --> 23:45.492
university e-mails--

23:45.525 --> 23:46.759
they're protected.

23:46.793 --> 23:50.229
The university is throwing up
a wall to protect their image.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.632
If we uncover that
one of their golden oarsmen

23:52.665 --> 23:54.801
is a rapist and a murderer,

23:54.834 --> 23:56.703
it will tarnish their brand,
and they know it.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.938
You need the victim
to file a complaint, okay?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.072
Where is Shelby Lockhart?

24:00.106 --> 24:02.875
We haven't been able
to locate her.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.712
Well, you don't have evidence
that supports the arrest

24:05.745 --> 24:06.546
of any of the oarsmen.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.014
That's the only way
you're gonna get

24:08.047 --> 24:09.549
your hands on those devices.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.750
How am I supposed
to get evidence

24:10.783 --> 24:13.252
for an arrest if I'm not allowed
to analyze those devices?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.654
We're on the same
side, Avery.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.556
There's just no way
to get around this.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.166
(sighs) All right, come on,
Shelby, where are you?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.169
Quinn was paid
to locate Shelby.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.839
There has to be some digital
trail that'll lead us to her.

24:32.872 --> 24:33.806
Hey, right here.
Where?

24:33.840 --> 24:36.676
Quinn was using Blackshades
to spy on Shelby.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.778
It mirrored Shelby's phone
onto Quinn's screen,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.514
allowing her to track
Shelby's every move.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.783
NELSON: Everything Shelby typed,
Quinn saw.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.719
Check this out.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.889
She wasn't only watching...

24:49.922 --> 24:51.257
Quinn also injected
targeted ads

24:51.290 --> 24:52.925
into Shelby's
FriendAgenda feed.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.162
RAMIREZ:
She was replacing Shelby's

24:56.195 --> 24:57.296
targeted shopping ads

24:57.329 --> 24:59.866
with online sexual assault
support groups.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.167
And Quinn knew
Shelby's secret.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.034
I mean, she wanted to help,

25:02.068 --> 25:03.936
but she couldn't out
herself as a hacker.

25:03.970 --> 25:07.574
Quinn was Shelby's
guardian angel.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.709
All right.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.911
So Shelby's phone
has been offline for a week.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.614
No phone service means the
spyware can't track her.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.616
NELSON: Hold up.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.317
The spyware didn't stop
tracking Shelby's phone

25:18.350 --> 25:19.686
because it went offline.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.187
The spyware forced it offline.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.955
Quinn disabled Shelby's phone.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.624
So her final act
as guardian angel

25:24.657 --> 25:27.727
was to stop Shelby's rapist

25:27.760 --> 25:29.829
from being able to find her.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.998
MUNDO:
Shelby Lockhart

25:32.031 --> 25:33.065
is alive.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.834
Her phone was inactive
because Quinn disabled it.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.268
Finally got ahold
of her parents.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.904
They just got back
from a cruise.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.271
They said that Shelby's old
phone wasn't working,

25:39.305 --> 25:40.940
so she got a new phone
and a new number.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.875
Nelson's tracking it right now.

25:42.909 --> 25:43.743
(phone chirps)
Good.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.144
That was quick.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.879
All right.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.215
We have an address.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.858
RYAN: Shelby, this is your
confession on Miafina.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.027
Why do you have this?

26:01.060 --> 26:04.764
Whoever attacked you
saw your confession.

26:04.797 --> 26:05.965
He was looking for you.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.134
Now I'm looking for him.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.836
I should never have posted that.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.904
It was stupid.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.873
It wasn't stupid.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.342
I thought if I posted it,

26:16.375 --> 26:18.945
that it'd make me
feel better or...

26:18.978 --> 26:21.247
help me to move forward,

26:21.280 --> 26:22.982
or to go to the police,

26:23.015 --> 26:25.017
to tell someone else.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.854
(sighs)

26:27.887 --> 26:29.321
Anyone else.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.357
Tell me, Shelby.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.160
Who assaulted you?

26:38.998 --> 26:40.399
(softly):
Um...

26:40.432 --> 26:42.735
there were three of them.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.673
I can't remember their faces.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.107
I never asked
for their names.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.809
(whimpering)
Yeah, stop crying.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.077
Stop crying.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.278
(sobbing):
No!

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
I went to the party

26:54.180 --> 26:57.016
the weekend that the crew team
won the Sprint of the Five Mile.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.653
I had two drinks.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.789
You know, they make them strong
on purpose.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.023
MAN: Yeah!

27:06.025 --> 27:07.694
I went looking for the bathroom,

27:07.727 --> 27:09.962
and the next thing I remember
is that painting.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.234
They held me down
to the pool table,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.269
and they pinned my arms back.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.005
I realized my skirt was up.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.707
No!
They took turns raping me.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.941
Help me!

27:21.974 --> 27:24.811
(sobbing): And I tried
to tell them to stop.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.279
I tried to fight them off,
and...

27:27.313 --> 27:30.950
and then I just-just
stared at that painting,

27:30.983 --> 27:32.919
and I prayed for it to be over.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.754
I'm so sorry that
happened to you.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.222
Did you report
your assault to anyone?

27:37.757 --> 27:39.726
The university.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.994
A few days after the party.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.063
I went to see an administrator
in the student life office.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.264
And she said

27:45.297 --> 27:48.735
that the school takes incidents
like this very seriously,

27:48.768 --> 27:50.469
but that I didn't have
a good case,

27:50.502 --> 27:52.739
because...

27:53.973 --> 27:55.708
...because I couldn't remember
their faces

27:55.742 --> 27:58.044
or their names,
and because I was drunk,

27:58.077 --> 27:59.979
and because I didn't turn it
in immediately.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.982
That I was-- I think she said--

28:03.015 --> 28:05.384
facing a hard fight.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.190
My body was covered in bruises.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.993
Why didn't you go to the police?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.494
She told me not to.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.097
She told me that I could lose
my scholarship

28:18.130 --> 28:21.100
if I falsely accused
the crew team of rape.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.301
(sighs)

28:22.334 --> 28:24.070
So then you left school.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.773
I couldn't pretend
that nothing had happened.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.910
Every male face was my rapist.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.146
I haven't told anyone else,

28:34.180 --> 28:35.848
not even my parents.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.316
My sister doesn't
even know, either.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.851
She-she thinks I'm here

28:38.885 --> 28:40.519
just to help her move
into her new place.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.421
I had to get away.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.925
I didn't think anyone
would believe me.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.427
I believe you.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.463
And I'm gonna help you.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.165
I promise.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.334
(sighs)

29:02.474 --> 29:03.976
MASON LYNNE:
Hello.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.377
Your Title IX complaint

29:05.411 --> 29:08.014
against Paxton University,
as requested.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.148
Excellent.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.318
Title IX requires
a school maintain

29:12.351 --> 29:14.086
a campus free of
sexual discrimination

29:14.120 --> 29:15.287
and violence.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.288
I'm disgusted.

29:16.322 --> 29:17.824
Paxton broke the law

29:17.857 --> 29:18.958
when they dissuaded Shelby

29:18.991 --> 29:20.526
from filing
a sexual assault complaint

29:20.559 --> 29:23.129
and threatened
to revoke her scholarship.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.230
They're supposed
to make sure

29:24.263 --> 29:26.098
that assault victims
can continue their education,

29:26.132 --> 29:27.366
not retaliate against them

29:27.399 --> 29:29.035
for reporting.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.336
So if Paxton is
found guilty

29:30.369 --> 29:32.038
of this violation,

29:32.071 --> 29:34.140
it'll hit them right
where it hurts, their wallet.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.908
Their federal funding
can be revoked.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.043
Good.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.277
Then they won't be able to hide

29:38.310 --> 29:39.545
what's happening
on campus anymore.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.313
No one should go through
what Shelby did.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.482
One question:

29:43.515 --> 29:44.416
Why did you list yourself

29:44.450 --> 29:46.853
as the complainant
and not Shelby Lockhart?

29:46.886 --> 29:49.121
Anyone who believes
there's been discrimination

29:49.155 --> 29:52.024
on the basis of sex
can file a complaint.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.292
I would rather be

29:53.325 --> 29:56.162
the thorn in Paxton's side than
have Shelby fight this battle,

29:56.195 --> 29:58.364
a battle that no university
should be waging

29:58.397 --> 30:01.067
against a sexual assault victim
to begin with.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.301
Where do I sign?

30:02.334 --> 30:03.602
Right there.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.171
Excellent strategy.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.039
If the university won't
speak up for the students,

30:07.073 --> 30:09.175
we'll speak up for
them ourselves.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.543
That's it.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.511
What?

30:12.544 --> 30:14.580
We've been working this case
from the top down.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.515
There were hundreds of students
at that party.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.018
If the university
won't stand up for Shelby,

30:19.051 --> 30:20.052
maybe another student will.

30:34.133 --> 30:37.036
(students talking, laughing)

30:37.069 --> 30:41.440
(bell tolling)

30:44.176 --> 30:45.444
Is this about the other night?

30:45.477 --> 30:46.412
I was just a little buzzed.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.647
You were more than buzzed;
you were drunk.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.082
I need you to be careful.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.151
I am being careful.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.185
Good.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.188
Do me a favor, download
an app called Witness.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.357
If you're ever in trouble,

30:58.390 --> 31:01.093
no matter what time of night,
I want you to send me an alert

31:01.127 --> 31:02.494
with your location.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.230
I will find you
and help you.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.065
Just promise me.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.233
I promise.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.267
(softly):
Okay.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.037
Avery, you could have texted me
or even called me

31:11.070 --> 31:12.104
about this.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.639
Is there something else?

31:13.672 --> 31:15.374
(sighs) Smart girl.

31:15.407 --> 31:18.144
I'm working a case at Paxton.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.546
There were photos
on FriendAgenda

31:20.579 --> 31:22.448
of you and your friend Noah

31:22.481 --> 31:25.317
at the crew team's
victory party.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.120
Three members of the team
sexually assaulted a young woman

31:28.154 --> 31:30.556
that night.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.224
Do you know anything about it?

31:32.258 --> 31:35.161
Did you see anything
or hear anything?

31:35.194 --> 31:37.096
What is it?

31:37.129 --> 31:37.997
I don't...

31:38.030 --> 31:40.166
I feel weird
talking to you about this.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.101
Grace, tell me.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.236
Avery, you can't just throw
around accusations like that.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.205
You're defensive. Why?

31:47.206 --> 31:49.308
Okay, look...

31:49.341 --> 31:51.277
Noah is my boyfriend.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.279
He transferred
into Paxton last year

31:53.312 --> 31:56.682
because he was falsely accused
of rape at his old school.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.218
There was
a police investigation.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.220
It got a lot of press
and everything,

32:01.253 --> 32:04.290
and then one month later,
the girl recanted her story.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.491
It was too late, you know.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.393
He had to leave
his university,

32:07.426 --> 32:08.660
his friends...

32:08.694 --> 32:10.562
take a year off to reapply.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.399
It took him forever
to trust anyone again,

32:13.432 --> 32:15.567
even me,
when we started dating.

32:15.601 --> 32:19.138
That's why you didn't
introduce me the other night.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.673
GRACE:
You're an FBI agent.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.343
You know, I was afraid
that you would look him up.

32:24.376 --> 32:27.079
Everyone gets to decide
whether he's guilty or innocent

32:27.113 --> 32:29.681
just by typing his name
into a search engine

32:29.715 --> 32:31.183
without even knowing the facts.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.252
(sighs)

32:33.285 --> 32:36.488
That girl's lie will effect Noah
for the rest of his life.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.624
Well, what happened to Noah
was terrible.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.592
No one should
go through that.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.294
But as an FBI agent,

32:42.328 --> 32:44.363
I operate
on a case-by-case basis,

32:44.396 --> 32:46.665
looking at the evidence
that's right in front of me.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.335
Grace, if you know anything

32:49.368 --> 32:51.203
about what happened
at that party,

32:51.237 --> 32:52.338
you need to tell me.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.572
I didn't see anyone
get attacked,

32:53.605 --> 32:54.706
but I've heard the rumors.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.378
There could be someone
who saw something.

32:59.411 --> 33:02.148
He was recording video
at the party all night.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.616
(cheering, whooping, shouting)

33:06.785 --> 33:08.720
His name is Carter Harris.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.256
Another student?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.623
He's on the crew team.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.728
RYAN: Carter, this is
not a code of silence

33:16.762 --> 33:18.530
you want to live the rest
of your life with.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.566
We know that
you were documenting

33:20.599 --> 33:22.301
the Sprint of
the Five Mile party.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.402
We need that footage.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.138
Well, you can't look at
my phone without my consent.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.474
You're right, we can't.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.110
But you need
to ask yourself

33:31.143 --> 33:32.244
what is more important:

33:32.278 --> 33:34.346
your team,

33:34.380 --> 33:36.548
or your integrity?

33:36.582 --> 33:38.317
And what about Shelby Lockhart?

33:40.452 --> 33:42.254
MUNDO: Listen, you're worried
about betraying your boys.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.389
I get it.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.690
You train together
year round,

33:44.723 --> 33:45.824
you compete all season,

33:45.857 --> 33:47.159
you party together
every weekend.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.360
You depend on each other.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.762
It's an amazing brotherhood.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.266
When you're part of
a group like that,

33:54.300 --> 33:55.667
nobody sees you
as an individual.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.770
Is this who you want to be?

34:00.239 --> 34:01.607
Come on, Carter,
do the right thing.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.244
I-I deleted the footage.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.179
They told me to.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.086
Here.
Maybe you can recover the video.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.189
RYAN:
Get that to Daniel Krumitz.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.228
*

34:33.205 --> 34:34.273
And what did you delete?

34:34.306 --> 34:35.874
I don't...
I-I'm not sure, really.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.443
I caught it by mistake.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.878
I was just... I was walking
around the house,

34:39.911 --> 34:41.380
filming the party,

34:41.413 --> 34:43.882
and I accidentally
walked in on them...

34:43.915 --> 34:45.817
uh, with Shelby.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.186
Raping Shelby.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.487
(sighs)

34:48.520 --> 34:50.156
Who did you see?

34:50.189 --> 34:51.390
I, uh, I can't be sure.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.459
You said they told you
to delete the footage.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.195
Who is "they"?

35:00.299 --> 35:02.134
Finn Thompson, Pete Winthrop

35:02.168 --> 35:03.835
and Thatcher Bell.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.271
I was coming home
from my last midterm

35:05.304 --> 35:06.772
and everybody in the house
was freaking out.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.907
One of the guys recognized
the painting from the house

35:08.940 --> 35:10.642
when he was reading
secrets on Miafina.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.578
RYAN:
What happened then?

35:12.611 --> 35:13.812
CARTER: Finn made us all swear
to keep our mouths shut.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.814
Look, those guys are headed
for the Olympics.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.883
A rape charge would...

35:17.916 --> 35:19.651
ruin their lives.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.589
(Shelby sobbing)

35:23.622 --> 35:24.923
Stop, please!

35:24.956 --> 35:27.193
Please, stop!

35:27.226 --> 35:29.295
(Shelby sobbing)

35:34.600 --> 35:36.268
All right! Pete Winthrop.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.270
Finn Thompson. Thatcher Bell.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.805
Stay.
Everybody else, get out.

35:39.838 --> 35:40.806
Stand up.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.808
Hands out to your sides.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.810
In case you've forgotten,
Officer,

35:44.843 --> 35:46.745
you're not allowed
to look at our phones.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.314
MUNDO: It's "agent,"
and you're under arrest

35:48.347 --> 35:49.281
for the aggravated
sexual abuse

35:49.315 --> 35:50.749
of Shelby Lockhart.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.619
With all due respect, Agent,

35:53.652 --> 35:55.321
we're the Paxton
crew team.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.755
We don't have to rape anyone.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.357
RYAN:
Rape isn't about sex.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.192
It's about power.

36:00.226 --> 36:03.362
And as a team,
you operate as a pack.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.264
This campus is
your hunting ground.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.566
Sorry, those a little tight?

36:12.638 --> 36:14.306
KRUMITZ:
Bad news.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.941
None of their phones
I.D. them as SOT515.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.209
What? Are you sure?

36:17.243 --> 36:18.577
Looks like someone else
hired Quinn

36:18.610 --> 36:20.212
to cover up their crime.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.314
RYAN:
Those three would've gone
to someone else for help.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.250
Their devices can
still lead us to him.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.451
I doubt they would've texted

36:25.484 --> 36:26.985
or called
whoever it was for help.

36:27.018 --> 36:27.986
No, you're right.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.555
They would've gone in person.

36:29.588 --> 36:30.722
And their phones
would've been with them.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.224
Frequent locations.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.493
Carter gave Avery the date

36:34.526 --> 36:36.262
that the team saw
Shelby's confession--

36:36.295 --> 36:37.429
last day of midterms.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.564
That was, uh, right there.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.898
November 19.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.633
All right, so,
other than their house

36:41.667 --> 36:43.302
and this facility,
were their phones ever

36:43.335 --> 36:45.237
in the same place
at the same time that day?

36:45.271 --> 36:46.338
They were all
in the same location

36:46.372 --> 36:48.006
for two hours:

36:48.039 --> 36:49.508
the athletic
director's office,

36:49.541 --> 36:50.909
Julian Perkins.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.244
Thank you.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.945
Oh, good.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.781
You saved me
a phone call.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.849
The university
attorney is on his way

36:57.883 --> 36:59.351
to get your search
warrants tossed.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.353
Those students will be
back on campus

37:01.387 --> 37:03.389
within the hour.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.556
I'm not here for your crew team.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.824
I'm here for you.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.993
I know that you're SOT515.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.328
(laughs)

37:09.361 --> 37:10.329
I'm afraid I have no idea

37:10.362 --> 37:11.430
what you're talking about.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.299
Mmm... I think you do.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.900
Your precious
crew team

37:14.933 --> 37:16.635
came to you with a problem:

37:16.668 --> 37:18.904
someone was accusing them
of rape

37:18.937 --> 37:20.038
on the Miafina
Web site.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.473
They claimed

37:21.507 --> 37:22.908
they didn't do it, of course,

37:22.941 --> 37:24.543
but this silly girl

37:24.576 --> 37:26.945
was threatening to make up
a story that they did.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.514
And when they couldn't find her,

37:28.547 --> 37:31.617
she became a ticking time bomb
for them and for you.

37:31.650 --> 37:35.287
That is quite the detailed
fabrication, Agent Ryan.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.390
It's the truth, Mr. Perkins.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.526
There's a funny
thing about guilt.

37:40.559 --> 37:43.362
It traps people
into reacting.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.397
The irony is,

37:45.431 --> 37:47.599
if your team members
had just left it alone,

37:47.633 --> 37:49.868
you could've
gotten away with all of it.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.537
The only ones

37:51.570 --> 37:53.705
who knew what Shelby's
confession really meant

37:53.739 --> 37:54.840
were the guilty.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.510
But then,
when Quinn Elliot went rogue,

37:58.544 --> 38:01.680
that's when you had
everything to lose.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.982
Your glory over
the Sprint of the Five Mile.

38:04.015 --> 38:07.453
The money and the prestige that
win brought this university.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.954
Your job.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.323
So you asked Quinn
to meet with you in person

38:11.357 --> 38:12.658
to work out a deal.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.059
PERKINS:
This is absurd.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.761
I have no idea who Quinn is.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.430
RYAN: And I had no idea
why she agreed

38:18.464 --> 38:19.665
to meet with you in person,

38:19.698 --> 38:21.567
but then her phone told me why.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.769
She launched
her video camera app.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.071
She planned on recording
your meeting

38:26.104 --> 38:27.406
to expose you.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.741
She knew that you were capable

38:29.775 --> 38:32.043
of covering up rape,
but she didn't know

38:32.077 --> 38:33.445
that you were capable of murder.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.548
(gunshots)

38:36.582 --> 38:40.085
Julian Perkins,
you are under arrest

38:40.118 --> 38:42.087
for the murder of Quinn Elliot.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.098
I never thought they'd be
punished, let alone this.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.801
First thing we need to do is get
you into a survivor's group.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.736
Then get you back into school.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.671
I don't know.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.973
I'm the girl who got
the crew team suspended.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.375
I'm the girl who lost the school

39:03.409 --> 39:05.143
the Sprint
of the Five Mile.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.479
People are gonna hate me.
Shelby...

39:07.513 --> 39:08.814
none of this
is your fault.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.683
They lost that title
all by themselves.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.152
But by coming forward,
you're protecting

39:14.185 --> 39:17.389
every other young woman
on this campus.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.924
You're exposing an ugly truth

39:18.957 --> 39:21.793
that is occurring on
universities across the country.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.697
Title IX requires
that the university

39:25.731 --> 39:27.399
keep you safe
from retaliation.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.534
I'm gonna make sure they do.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.670
I don't want to be known as
"the rape victim" on campus.

39:31.703 --> 39:32.804
I get that.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.740
Unfortunately,
this is an epidemic.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.575
And the reality is,

39:36.608 --> 39:37.943
everywhere you go on campus,

39:37.976 --> 39:40.546
you will be surrounded
by other women

39:40.579 --> 39:42.548
who've experienced
sexual violence.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.450
Women like you.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.485
You're not alone.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.088
And while you're a victim,

39:50.121 --> 39:52.057
you're also a survivor.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.059
Look, this is just
the beginning.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.127
You still need
to go through trial,

39:56.161 --> 39:57.796
you need to testify...

39:57.829 --> 39:59.931
I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.767
It's not going to be easy,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.602
but when it is over,
you will be glad that you did.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.705
And I'm gonna be there for you

40:06.738 --> 40:08.974
every step of the way.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.809
'Cause I've got your back.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.110
Thank you.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.949
(sniffling)

40:19.985 --> 40:20.986
(light switch clacks)

40:23.955 --> 40:25.691
You're seriously
not gonna tell me

40:25.724 --> 40:26.992
your most
dangerous hack?

40:27.025 --> 40:28.860
I told you mine.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.629
Listen, honestly,

40:30.662 --> 40:32.631
I have too many
to choose from.
Okay.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.199
(elevator bell dings)

40:34.232 --> 40:37.002
Mr. James.
Thanks for coming in.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.004
We want to tell you something
about your wife.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.238
Haven't I heard enough?

40:40.271 --> 40:42.040
She wasn't who she said she was.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.009
Maybe not.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.944
Your wife wasn't killed
because she was hacking.

40:47.245 --> 40:48.780
She was killed
because she stopped.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.618
She died protecting the young
woman she was hired to hack.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.620
Your wife was a hero.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.688
I wish I could be sure
that's the truth.

40:56.722 --> 40:57.923
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.926
RAMIREZ: Hackers are
secretive by nature.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.894
But our devices
know more about us

41:02.928 --> 41:05.263
than anyone
in our lives.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.264
"Us."

41:06.297 --> 41:07.999
You're a...

41:08.033 --> 41:10.869
A hacker. Yeah.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.103
We both are.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.939
Former black hats.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.074
Lexie's phone told us
she was turning her life around.

41:16.107 --> 41:19.044
Why do you keep
calling her Lexie?

41:19.077 --> 41:21.246
Your boss told me that
her real name is Quinn.

41:21.279 --> 41:24.182
Because of this.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.953
QUINN:
This is Quinn's last job.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.755
Then I will live only as Lexie.

41:29.788 --> 41:34.159
I owe it to him to be the wife
he thinks he married.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.861
What is this?

41:35.894 --> 41:37.062
RAMIREZ:
Lexie's secret.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.130
It's a confession
she posted as Lexie James.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.933
She was done
living a double life.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.502
She wanted to put
Quinn behind her.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.140
She was choosing me.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.242
You gave her a reason to change.

41:53.078 --> 41:55.313
Nothing can bring
your wife back.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.749
But this might be able to help.

41:57.783 --> 41:59.618
It's a zero day exploit

41:59.651 --> 42:00.852
for ToggleFly.

42:00.886 --> 42:03.188
Allows a hacker to steal login
information from the users.

42:03.221 --> 42:04.723
Lexie found it.

42:04.756 --> 42:05.991
RAMIREZ:
Companies pay hackers

42:06.024 --> 42:07.859
who find bugs in their systems.

42:07.893 --> 42:09.294
It's completely legal

42:09.327 --> 42:10.996
and it's worth a lot of money.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.131
NELSON:
And it's yours.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.533
A gift from Quinn.

42:20.806 --> 42:21.807
Lexie.
