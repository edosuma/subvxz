00:06.441 --> 00:09.477
How am I getting shorter?

Jeremy.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.416
Hey, Ab.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.817
Hey.

00:16.852 --> 00:18.719
Locked out of my apartment.

00:18.753 --> 00:19.854
You have a spare, right?

00:19.888 --> 00:22.189
No, I don't, I don't,
I would totally remember

00:22.224 --> 00:24.625
if I had, um, one of your keys.

00:24.659 --> 00:25.893
That's weird.

00:25.927 --> 00:27.828
You'd be the person I'd pick
if I gave someone a spare,

00:27.863 --> 00:29.997
so, I just assumed you had one.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.031
I would be?

00:31.066 --> 00:32.333
I mean, I would take one.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.869
If we want to go through
that and that commitment,

00:34.903 --> 00:36.804
I would have it with
me whenever.

00:36.838 --> 00:37.972
Um...

00:38.006 --> 00:39.607
While you're here,
inside my apartment,

00:39.633 --> 00:41.912
maybe you could help me
put up a shelf?

00:43.078 --> 00:44.345
I'd love to.

00:44.379 --> 00:45.880
Let's do that then.

00:45.914 --> 00:48.682
♪ Blades of grass to look

00:56.748 --> 00:57.825

00:57.859 --> 00:59.426

I take off my shirt?

00:59.461 --> 01:01.128
Wow... Um.

01:01.163 --> 01:02.479
Sure.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.775
Where'd you get
all that oil from?

01:08.403 --> 01:09.937
Now I can put up that shelf.

01:14.042 --> 01:16.451
You're so... slippery.

01:19.114 --> 01:19.997
Wow.

01:21.416 --> 01:22.666
That was a hot dream.

01:24.786 --> 01:26.620

01:38.433 --> 01:39.767
Hey sleepyhead.

01:39.801 --> 01:41.936
Someone had a sexy dream, huh?

01:41.970 --> 01:43.571
Shut up, Bevers.

01:43.605 --> 01:46.273
Shut your stupid face.

01:50.345 --> 01:51.779
I'm so happy you're here.

01:51.813 --> 01:54.415
I was thinking maybe we could
masturbate next to each other.

01:54.449 --> 01:55.583
Really?

01:55.617 --> 01:57.084
I'm always trying to
get you to parallel play.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.285
You're never into it.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.989
It's because I want to so badly.

02:07.696 --> 02:08.961
Oh my God.

02:10.098 --> 02:12.299
What a way to start the day.

02:12.334 --> 02:14.435

02:56.444 --> 02:58.379
So many awesome things

02:58.413 --> 03:00.347
Like, for instance,
Bevers is here.

03:00.382 --> 03:03.050
- And he invited his sister to stay.
- Ew.

03:09.724 --> 03:10.899
Funny enough.

03:11.459 --> 03:14.995
And she said that it's not where
you would expect it to be.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.730
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

03:16.765 --> 03:18.615
'Sup, Marla Bevers.

03:19.713 --> 03:21.201

Just kidding.

03:22.237 --> 03:23.358
I know I smell potato salad.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.664
I think it was a gift
for the host of the party.

03:26.608 --> 03:27.975
Isn't this so fun?

03:28.009 --> 03:29.576
It's like the gang's all here.

03:29.611 --> 03:30.678
Yeah... I was dying to see

03:30.712 --> 03:32.179
where my baby bro lives.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.315
Well, it's not his apartment.

03:34.349 --> 03:35.449
His girlfriend lives here, so...

03:35.483 --> 03:37.651
Where is your girlfriend, dude?

03:37.686 --> 03:40.220
- Well, she went...
- Yeah, she went to her parents' house.

03:40.255 --> 03:41.355
In Jersey.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.690
To escape the storm.

03:42.724 --> 03:44.358
They were supposed to go...
She asked him to go.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.393
I don't know what's
going on with that.

03:46.428 --> 03:47.828
It's just too much presh.

03:47.862 --> 03:50.230
Her parents are like,

but the fun's staying here!

03:54.135 --> 03:55.569
It's like camp right now!

03:55.603 --> 03:57.438
I have an idea... Drinking game.

03:57.472 --> 03:58.439
Yes!

03:58.473 --> 03:59.373
Yes!

03:59.407 --> 04:00.374
Mm.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.209
- Yes!
- Yes, I get the booze.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.411
I think that's
a great idea, Ilana.

04:09.784 --> 04:11.652
I feel like nobody else
is here, you know?

04:16.791 --> 04:18.459
In case we all die,
there is something

04:18.493 --> 04:20.177
that I must
confess to you, Ilana.

04:20.795 --> 04:22.196
Um...

04:23.832 --> 04:30.037
Last summer, um, I switched our
laptop chargers in the night...

04:30.071 --> 04:32.355
during the night,
like a sneaky thief.

04:33.004 --> 04:34.284
And that's why
yours never works.

04:34.309 --> 04:35.876
And I see you try and
you try and you try

04:35.910 --> 04:37.878

04:37.912 --> 04:39.480
- Oh.
- It's never gonna work, Ilana.

04:39.514 --> 04:40.748
I'm so sorry.

04:40.782 --> 04:41.982
It's not a big deal at all.

Um, I'll guess I'll go.

05:02.871 --> 05:05.773
Never have I ever...

05:05.807 --> 05:07.474

divorce affected my overall,

your ear to relax you

06:31.693 --> 06:33.193

everybody out here.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.194

08:34.150 --> 08:36.618
You... You do...

08:36.652 --> 08:38.019
Do you grant me permission

08:38.054 --> 08:41.389
to use any means necessary
to make this go away?

08:41.424 --> 08:42.823
Sure, fine.

08:42.857 --> 08:47.027
Look me in the eyes and
tell me I have your permission.

08:48.164 --> 08:49.698
You have my permission.

08:49.732 --> 08:52.033
- Any means necessary?

A shelf fell.

09:31.574 --> 09:33.007
Off the wall... It was crazy.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.075
You need some help?

09:34.110 --> 09:35.477
I'm pretty good
with the felf shells.

09:35.511 --> 09:36.478
No, no, no.

09:36.512 --> 09:37.712
We should stay out here.

09:37.747 --> 09:39.013
- We should definitely...
- Hey, guys.

09:39.048 --> 09:40.715
We're putting
together a talent show.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.084
Don't have to figure out what
your talent is, Ab.

09:43.119 --> 09:45.418
Pretty sure it's
not washing dishes.

09:46.088 --> 09:48.505
She's always making
me wash dishes!

09:50.860 --> 09:53.027
Such a jokester.

09:53.062 --> 09:54.996
I love dishes and washing them.

09:55.030 --> 09:55.997
It is gone.

09:56.031 --> 09:57.031
The deed is done.

09:57.066 --> 09:59.067

10:15.985 --> 10:18.286

10:18.320 --> 10:20.255
As these wind speeds
increase, it is critical

10:20.289 --> 10:21.656
that you stay inside.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.425
We've already seen reports
of downed power lines

10:23.459 --> 10:25.260
and we're seeing heavy debris

10:25.294 --> 10:26.895
blowing from construction sites.

10:26.929 --> 10:29.063
Wind gusts are going
to go a lot higher

10:29.098 --> 10:30.932
before this is over.

10:30.966 --> 10:32.534
Hello, my name is Flo.

10:32.568 --> 10:34.235
Everyone say, "Hello, Flo."

10:34.270 --> 10:36.237
Hello, Flo.

10:36.272 --> 10:37.639
I can do lots of dances.

10:37.673 --> 10:39.353
I can do the running man.

10:40.776 --> 10:43.445
- I can do the Roger Rabbit.
- It looks real.

10:43.479 --> 10:46.548
I went into the park and
I did some jumping jacks.

10:46.582 --> 10:49.884

11:18.981 --> 11:20.915
is the best part of the rap,
I swear to God.

11:20.950 --> 11:21.983
I'll go next.

11:22.017 --> 11:23.485
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:23.519 --> 11:24.819
It's all right...
You can show it to me later.

11:24.854 --> 11:29.958
My talent is I will leg
wrestle anyone in here.

11:29.992 --> 11:31.993
You... Cheekbones.

11:32.027 --> 11:33.359
Let's do this.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.137
Down on your butt.

11:37.366 --> 11:38.600
Here we go.

11:38.634 --> 11:39.801
Yeah, lock 'em up!

11:39.835 --> 11:41.369
Lock 'em up!

11:41.403 --> 11:42.470
Oh!

11:42.505 --> 11:45.640
I got a boot in my cootch
and I do not care!

11:45.674 --> 11:46.641
What?

11:46.675 --> 11:47.709
What are you doing?

11:47.743 --> 11:49.277
You are wasting
edge of death time.

11:49.311 --> 11:50.712
- Make a move.
- What do you what me to do?

11:50.746 --> 11:54.649
My talent can't be
to like, wash his body.

11:54.683 --> 11:57.819
You mean like, wash his
body after sex, right?

11:57.853 --> 12:00.855
- I want to make sure you're optimizing your fantasies.
- All right, it's the first thing I thought of.

12:00.890 --> 12:02.624
I know what we will do.

12:02.658 --> 12:04.325
I know what we will do.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.729
You say, "Let's
play Truth or Dare."

12:07.763 --> 12:10.698
You pick me, I say, "Dare"
and then...

12:10.733 --> 12:11.733
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.034
Say no more.

12:13.068 --> 12:14.204
Okay, cool.

12:15.871 --> 12:18.339
- 10, yes!
- Whoo!

12:18.374 --> 12:20.308
Champion!

12:20.342 --> 12:22.143
Don't feel bad.

12:22.177 --> 12:23.534
I'm on speed.

12:24.046 --> 12:25.008
Yeah.

12:26.248 --> 12:27.649
Okay, you guys.

12:27.683 --> 12:28.650
Truth or Dare.

12:28.684 --> 12:29.651
No, come on.

12:29.685 --> 12:31.152
We have to finish
the talent show.

12:31.186 --> 12:32.287
No, we don't.

12:32.321 --> 12:36.925
Um, hmm... Who should I...
who wants to... Abbi.

12:36.959 --> 12:38.026
Truth or dare?

12:38.060 --> 12:39.227
Truth or dare?

12:39.261 --> 12:40.495
Truth or dare?

12:40.529 --> 12:42.397
You know what,
I'm gonna go with dare.

12:42.431 --> 12:43.431
Okay.

12:43.465 --> 12:46.601
I dare you to
suck Jeremy's (bleep).

12:48.270 --> 12:49.804
Um, that's a wrap
on Truth or Dare.

12:53.976 --> 12:55.858
Oh my God.

12:56.879 --> 12:58.880
Oh, this is an
amazing use of space.

12:58.914 --> 13:01.883
See, this is next
level feng shui.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.285
That pasty ass.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.647
He lives here for free.

13:06.255 --> 13:07.463
Whoa.

13:08.123 --> 13:09.357
That's Abbi's roommate?

13:09.391 --> 13:10.358
Yeah.

13:10.392 --> 13:11.926
She is so hot, it's bizarre.

13:11.961 --> 13:13.528
Look at her body... So tight.

13:13.562 --> 13:16.254
Next to him, it's
just like, "You suck, dude."

13:16.966 --> 13:19.048
Fully stocked mini fridge.

13:20.803 --> 13:22.804
Should I put my Lincoln Log
on one of these cans?

13:22.838 --> 13:24.906
That is so sweet.

13:24.940 --> 13:26.708
Abbi would love it.

13:26.742 --> 13:29.517
Guys, there's something that
I want to get off my chest.

13:30.079 --> 13:32.180
In case, you know, we die today.

13:35.618 --> 13:36.918
It's okay.

13:40.456 --> 13:43.124
I once ate a corn on the cob...

13:43.158 --> 13:44.926
including the cob.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.595
I can't really... I don't see
anything wrong with that.

13:47.630 --> 13:48.730
It's okay.

13:48.764 --> 13:50.131
I'm sure it's good
for you in some ways.

13:50.165 --> 13:52.233
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's roughage, right?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.735
I do it every time.

13:53.769 --> 13:55.460
I'm sorry, do you guys
smell something?

13:57.206 --> 13:58.506
No.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.008
Smell a little like dookie, no?

14:00.042 --> 14:01.643
Can you grab me some more
wine just to top it off?

14:01.677 --> 14:05.079
- It's getting flat.
- Sure.

14:05.114 --> 14:06.681
Jaime, it's you.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.082
You smell terrible.

14:08.117 --> 14:09.250
I smelled it all night.

14:09.284 --> 14:10.318
I'm sorry.

14:10.352 --> 14:11.632
I think you stepped
in something.

14:11.654 --> 14:12.987
I'm so sorry.

14:13.022 --> 14:16.324
I think that we can all
agree that there's no smell.

14:16.358 --> 14:17.625
It's the storm, I think.

14:17.660 --> 14:18.608
Yep.

14:22.798 --> 14:25.133
Sweet dreams on my ass, Bevers!

14:27.469 --> 14:29.261
Yes... Got it!

14:31.407 --> 14:32.940
W-w-wait, wait, wait.

14:32.975 --> 14:34.123
Ew.

14:38.247 --> 14:39.847
It's tea time, bitch.

14:39.882 --> 14:41.349
Oh, governor!

14:41.383 --> 14:43.351
I have a hole in my weenus!

14:46.355 --> 14:47.622
Have you been to Africa?

14:47.656 --> 14:48.790
- No.
- Oh, you gotta go.

14:48.824 --> 14:50.058
I would love to go.

14:50.092 --> 14:53.027
Yeah, I learned to cook meat
just out in the wilderness.

14:53.062 --> 14:55.296
Yeah, you, you
cook a lot, right?

14:55.330 --> 14:57.565
Every time I'm outside your
door, it smells so good.

14:57.599 --> 14:59.999
- It smells like garlic or...
- You're smelling my apartment?

15:00.002 --> 15:03.671
Walking to places that I go.

15:03.706 --> 15:05.907
I go to a lot of spots.

15:05.941 --> 15:08.142
To answer your question,
I love to cook.

15:08.177 --> 15:09.177
Me too.

15:09.211 --> 15:11.546
I think cooking is
just a wonderful thing.

15:11.580 --> 15:16.250
It's like, spices all over
stuff and mixed in.

15:16.285 --> 15:17.752
What do you like to make?

15:17.786 --> 15:20.054
Egg, mostly.

15:22.357 --> 15:24.048
What the hell!

15:24.593 --> 15:26.634
Who (bleep) in my shoe?

15:30.700 --> 15:32.301
Mother(bleep)!

15:32.335 --> 15:34.336
So which one of
you maggots did it?

15:34.371 --> 15:35.638
Okay, um, I'm going to go.

15:35.672 --> 15:36.839
I live right next door, so...

15:36.873 --> 15:39.775
No one's going
anywhere until I find out

15:39.810 --> 15:44.313
who took a (bleep)
in my Shapely!

15:44.347 --> 15:47.316
Was it you, Dimples?

15:47.350 --> 15:48.517
No, no.

15:48.552 --> 15:50.186
I'm on a low-fiber diet.

15:50.220 --> 15:51.454
I go like, twice a week, tops.

15:51.488 --> 15:52.688
I promise.

15:52.722 --> 15:53.956
You know, it could
have been anyone, actually,

15:53.990 --> 15:55.524
'cause in hurricanes, people
are coming and going

15:55.559 --> 15:57.860
and there's a lot
of stuff happening.

16:00.497 --> 16:03.532
Matty, come on, huh?

16:03.567 --> 16:04.733
Camp was rough.

16:04.768 --> 16:07.703
Tonight brought up a lot
of bad memories.

16:07.737 --> 16:10.039
You took a dump in my size 11s.

16:10.073 --> 16:11.574
Just say so.

16:11.608 --> 16:12.842
No, it wasn't me.

16:12.876 --> 16:14.677
It wasn't me at camp either.

16:14.711 --> 16:15.811
Camp was the best.

16:15.846 --> 16:17.480
I had the best time.

16:17.514 --> 16:20.049
Danny was the coolest
counselor ever.

16:20.083 --> 16:23.853
Only me and Greg Shapiro
could blow ourselves.

16:23.887 --> 16:26.489
I was always the fastest at it.

16:26.523 --> 16:27.737
Always!

16:28.391 --> 16:29.658
What?

16:29.693 --> 16:30.740
No.

16:31.761 --> 16:33.496
No... Oh.

16:33.530 --> 16:35.431
No, no, you got it wrong.

16:35.465 --> 16:37.333
It wasn't like that!

16:37.367 --> 16:41.837
I would blow myself and Greg
would blow himself separate,

16:41.872 --> 16:43.005
across the room.

16:43.039 --> 16:44.507
There's a video of it!

16:44.541 --> 16:45.608
There's a...

16:50.313 --> 16:55.074
Are you the secret dumper,
brown eyes?

16:56.052 --> 16:57.686
Oh my God.

16:57.721 --> 16:59.788
Marla, I know... It was Brody.

16:59.823 --> 17:00.789
Come on, Brody!

17:00.824 --> 17:01.924
Come on out here, boy.

17:01.958 --> 17:03.192
Come on out!

17:03.226 --> 17:04.425
Brody's my dog.

17:04.461 --> 17:05.928
And that explains it.

17:05.962 --> 17:07.029
Sorry, guys.

17:07.063 --> 17:08.696
Oh, I feel like a crazy
methhead right now.

17:08.732 --> 17:09.765
It's okay...
It's fine, it's fine.

17:09.799 --> 17:12.067
Except for one thing!

17:12.102 --> 17:18.307
If you had a dog, I'd be dead
because I'm allergic, bitch!

17:18.340 --> 17:23.479
So Abbi, why'd you (bleep)
in my Shapelys?

17:23.512 --> 17:26.582
And tell it to the toe!

17:30.353 --> 17:31.887
Fine!

17:31.922 --> 17:33.722
God, it was me!

17:33.757 --> 17:35.257
I didn't (bleep)
in your Shapely though.

17:35.292 --> 17:36.392
I wouldn't do that.

17:36.426 --> 17:38.494
I (bleep) in the toilet,
but there's no water

17:38.528 --> 17:39.795
and I couldn't flush it.

17:39.829 --> 17:41.263
Ilana said that she
would take care of it.

17:41.298 --> 17:45.856
I did not think that that meant
she would put it in your shoe.

17:46.336 --> 17:47.303
God.

17:47.337 --> 17:48.317
I'm sorry.

17:49.205 --> 17:50.111
I'm sorry.

17:50.807 --> 17:53.309
Okay, uh, this was so fun.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.116
I'm gonna go.

17:55.645 --> 17:57.012
Glad I kept my shoes on.

17:57.047 --> 17:59.982
I will see you...
when I see you.

18:00.016 --> 18:01.483
I feel like I
can explain it better.

18:01.651 --> 18:02.585
In the hall.

18:02.752 --> 18:04.500
Okay.

18:09.225 --> 18:10.626
Oh, hey, Ilana.

18:10.694 --> 18:12.828
Crazy things
happening right now.

18:12.996 --> 18:15.598
When you said you were a ninja,
I didn't know that that meant

18:15.632 --> 18:17.866
you were just
gonna put it in a shoe.

18:17.901 --> 18:19.001
What?

18:19.035 --> 18:20.169
I didn't put it in a shoe.

18:20.203 --> 18:22.004
There's (bleep) in
this shoe, is there not?

18:22.038 --> 18:25.474
Thank you so much
for covering for me.

18:25.508 --> 18:26.508
You're the best.

18:26.543 --> 18:28.143
You (bleep) in your
sister's Shapely.

18:28.178 --> 18:29.712
Just trying to say thank you.

18:29.746 --> 18:32.214
I'm really glad that Jeremy
thinks it was you and not me,

18:32.248 --> 18:35.050
'cause I think I might be
developing a man crush on him.

18:35.085 --> 18:36.452
He's pretty cool.

18:36.486 --> 18:38.454
Let me take that.

18:38.488 --> 18:41.156
You don't have to worry
about this again.

18:42.325 --> 18:43.292
I get it.

18:43.326 --> 18:44.560
Jeremy has amazing teeth.

18:44.594 --> 18:47.196
Yeah... Jeremy's pretty amazing.

18:47.230 --> 18:48.897
Do you mind if I talk to
Lincoln for a second?

18:48.932 --> 18:49.898
Sure.

18:51.501 --> 18:55.838
Hi, Lincoln, um, before we die,
which might be tonight,

18:55.872 --> 18:57.673
there is something
that I have to say to you

18:57.707 --> 18:59.408
and it's very hard
for me to say.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.076
Listen, we've known
each other for a while,

19:01.111 --> 19:02.411
so you can say anything to me.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.346
What's up?

19:04.381 --> 19:05.848
Okay, Jaime say it, okay?

19:05.882 --> 19:07.516
Um...

19:07.550 --> 19:09.818
When I was a little boy,
I had a pet turtle.

19:09.853 --> 19:11.020
His name was Franklin.

19:11.054 --> 19:15.524
Privately, though, his
name was the N-word.

19:15.558 --> 19:18.193
I would say,
"Come here, (bleep).

19:18.228 --> 19:19.695
I love you, (bleep)."

19:19.729 --> 19:21.830
I'm so sorry.

19:33.444 --> 19:35.711
Get out there and bounce
them little titties

19:35.746 --> 19:37.814
for that hunky, quarter-Latino.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.822
- Thank you.
- Hey.

19:39.550 --> 19:40.554
Gimme.

19:41.085 --> 19:42.556
Oh my God, thank you.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.758
Hold up!

19:48.792 --> 19:50.993
Oh!

19:51.028 --> 19:53.262
Yeah!

19:58.068 --> 20:01.437
We're just putting
together a talent show.

20:07.478 --> 20:08.878
♪ Do it again ♪

20:20.090 --> 20:22.725
It's all in good fun.

20:26.263 --> 20:27.230
It is gone.

20:27.264 --> 20:28.297
The deed is done.

20:28.332 --> 20:30.633
- Your sh...
- Iiit...

20:30.667 --> 20:38.241
♪ It looks like
there's a talent show ♪

20:38.275 --> 20:40.576

20:40.611 --> 20:44.814

go do that now ♪

20:47.518 --> 20:48.651
Ooh.
