01:39.460 --> 01:40.420
Riggs, Homicide.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.220
- Nobody's dead.
- The night's young.

01:42.460 --> 01:43.820
This is Sergeant Murtaugh.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.500
- Threat or a scare?
- Real thing.

01:45.740 --> 01:46.860
He saw the device.

01:47.100 --> 01:50.220
It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.
I wrote the license plate number.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.980
That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.220
- You evacuated the building?
- It's clean.

01:54.460 --> 01:56.020
- Where's the bomb squad?
- Coming.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.260
Good. It's under control. Let's go.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.660
I think we ought to check this out.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.540
- Hey, Riggs.
- What?

02:02.780 --> 02:04.700
- Bomb squad's coming.
- There's no bomb.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.220
- How do you know?
- Because it's a full moon.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.500
Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.540
- Is that Greek?
- No, Latin.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.460
You surprise the shit out of me.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.740
There's no bomb.
It's probably a false alarm.

02:15.980 --> 02:18.420
It happens. He probably saw a radio
on the back seat.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.940
Let's not mess with it.
Wait for the bomb squad.

02:21.180 --> 02:24.180
You're right. You sit tight,
I'll be right back.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.780
What's the matter with you?

02:26.020 --> 02:28.020
- There's a bomb in there!
- No, there's not.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.100
- There's a bomb in there!
- There is not.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.580
There's a bomb in there!

02:31.820 --> 02:33.060
- You know how I know?
- How?

02:33.300 --> 02:36.460
I've got eight days till retirement
and I won't make a stupid mistake.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.460
There is no bomb.
I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.380
Look.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.380
Trust me. Okay?

02:47.260 --> 02:50.900
That's usually my first mistake.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.180
Hey, wait. I'm coming.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.460
Rog?

02:54.700 --> 02:57.340
- Is your insurance paid up?
- Of course. Why?

02:57.580 --> 03:01.700
- There could be a bomb in here.
- Oh, God!

03:02.860 --> 03:06.180
- I hate it when I'm right.
- Learn to trust your instincts more.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.780
Oh, God.

03:08.020 --> 03:12.060
The first impression
can often be the right one.

03:14.100 --> 03:14.860
Drive shaft...

03:15.100 --> 03:18.540
- I wonder if there's a bomb.
- Just don't touch it.

03:18.780 --> 03:21.620
Just looking.

03:25.260 --> 03:30.340
What are you doing? Don't open the door!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.620
Son of a bitch, just look at it.

03:34.860 --> 03:38.180
That's all I'll do, just look.

03:39.740 --> 03:42.060
There's more plastic than Cher.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.180
I love this job. This is amateur night.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.060
Open the door. I can't hear you.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.580
Open the door.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.140
Don't do nothing.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.820
Not that one!

03:52.060 --> 03:53.260
You son of a bitch.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.260
This is a pretty shonky job.
I think I can dismantle it.

03:56.500 --> 04:00.380
It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!

04:02.020 --> 04:05.660
Everybody's outside. Just me, you
and the cat are dumb enough to be here.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.940
Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?

04:09.180 --> 04:10.780
- Relax, Rog. Relax.
- Right.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.020
Don't do nothing.

04:12.260 --> 04:15.260
We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.
You know what we can do?

04:15.500 --> 04:16.779
We could drive it out.

04:17.019 --> 04:18.700
Fine, it's your turn to drive.

04:18.940 --> 04:21.100
No keys. I could hot-wire it.

04:21.339 --> 04:23.500
Don't even say "hot-wire"
around this stuff!

04:23.740 --> 04:24.540
You're right.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.660
Why am I doing this? Why?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.580
We're going to have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.340
What are you thinking?

04:31.580 --> 04:33.820
What are you thinking?

04:34.060 --> 04:36.300
- I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.
- Wait!

04:36.540 --> 04:38.940
- That's not what I think.
- You think maybe the red?

04:39.180 --> 04:40.220
No! No!

04:40.460 --> 04:42.500
I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.900
We can go upstairs, wait for
the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.

04:46.140 --> 04:49.580
The bomb squad never gets here on time.
And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.

04:49.820 --> 04:50.620
Rog, please.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.100
Forget the cappuccino.

04:52.340 --> 04:55.300
- You know what they'll say?
- "Get the fuck out of here!"

04:55.540 --> 04:59.540
But then they'll say: "Let's cut
the blue wire", which I'll do right now.

04:59.780 --> 05:01.220
- Wait, wait!
- What?

05:01.460 --> 05:02.820
How can you be so sure?

05:03.060 --> 05:04.060
It's just a hunch.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.100
A hunch?

05:05.340 --> 05:07.060
Remember the bomb under your toilet?

05:07.300 --> 05:09.740
- How could I forget?
- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.700
This is more simplified,
but a bit more powerful.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.620
From where I sat, I couldn't see.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.380
Forget it. Come on, trust me.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.500
Trust you?

05:17.740 --> 05:21.700
Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?

05:22.860 --> 05:23.820
What? What?

05:24.060 --> 05:26.780
A minute ago you said blue.

05:27.020 --> 05:27.740
I did?

05:27.980 --> 05:29.460
You said blue.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.260
- I meant red.
- Sure?

05:31.500 --> 05:32.860
We can do it your way if you like.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.100
- My way? I don't have...
- Quiet!

05:35.340 --> 05:36.220
I'm sure, okay?

05:36.460 --> 05:39.220
Ah, shit!

05:40.540 --> 05:42.220
Ready?

05:42.460 --> 05:42.980
Rog?

05:43.220 --> 05:44.380
What?

05:44.620 --> 05:47.340
Won't you miss all this good stuff
when you retire?

05:47.580 --> 05:51.060
Won't you miss it a little bit?

05:52.420 --> 05:54.220
I'm cutting the wire.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.780
Snip. All done.

06:01.100 --> 06:01.980
Grab the cat!

06:02.220 --> 06:03.340
Grab the cat?

06:03.580 --> 06:07.100
Get out of there! Take cover!

07:04.060 --> 07:06.820
Where are they?

07:10.460 --> 07:12.900
Bravo.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.980
Whoops.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.660
Right. "Whoops."

07:23.420 --> 07:26.820
Right.

07:30.140 --> 07:32.900
Seven days till retirement,
I'm busted down to patrolman.

07:33.140 --> 07:35.260
I should've cut the red wire.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.580
- You did.
- No, I cut the blue wire.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.220
That's what I meant.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.780
- We should've waited for the bomb squad.
- Must I hear this every day?

07:43.020 --> 07:46.620
- Every day until I retire!
- That'll be a week too long.

07:46.860 --> 07:49.220
- My feet are killing me.
- They're killing me, too.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.820
- How?
- I have to listen to you bitch about them!

07:52.060 --> 07:55.780
- Because you should've cut the red wire!
- I did cut the red wire!

07:56.020 --> 07:56.780
What's this?

07:57.020 --> 07:59.020
It's kind of soft. Not a bulletproof vest.

07:59.260 --> 08:00.660
It won't keep anything out.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.220
It'll keep my stomach in.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.700
What have you got under there?

08:04.940 --> 08:06.140
It's a girdle.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.340
What?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.220
It's a girdle.

08:10.460 --> 08:11.340
Does Trish know?

08:11.580 --> 08:12.860
It's a man's girdle.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.380
They make girdles for men?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.620
- Yes, they make girdles for men.
- They do?

08:16.860 --> 08:19.340
Yeah, they do.
I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.

08:19.580 --> 08:22.300
- Cleaners must have shrunk it.
- You should take it to Chin.

08:22.540 --> 08:26.060
I did take it to Chin. Look at it.
It shrunk all up in here.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.820
I have to hold my breath.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.020
Did you see that?

08:29.260 --> 08:31.700
- See what?
- Jaywalker.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.299
Jaywalking?

08:33.539 --> 08:35.740
Hold it right there, pal.
Step up here, please.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.179
- Me?
- Yes, you.

08:37.419 --> 08:38.700
- What'd I do?
- Stand there.

08:38.940 --> 08:41.659
Jaywalking. I saw you.
I'll have to cite you.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.260
Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on!

08:44.500 --> 08:47.780
- Should I radio for backup?
- Smart-ass. Can you get the ticket book?

08:48.020 --> 08:50.460
There are crimes in the city
and you're hassling me...

08:50.700 --> 08:53.660
Shut up!

08:55.180 --> 08:58.620
- Do you know how to fill one of these out?
- A long time ago.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.380
I can't read it. The print is too small
without my glasses.

09:02.620 --> 09:05.580
Can we speed this up?
You may have nothing to do, but I do.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.780
No, we can't, so will you shut up?

09:09.020 --> 09:10.860
- Jaywalking.
- Ask for his license.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.700
- License, for jaywalking?
- Yeah.

09:12.940 --> 09:15.580
I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.

09:15.820 --> 09:18.300
I was walking.
Do I need a walking license now?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.220
- Let's just shoot him!
- Is he crazy?

09:20.460 --> 09:23.140
I'm going to drill him!
We'll make it look like suicide!

09:23.380 --> 09:25.740
- Get out of the way!
- No, the video cameras!

09:25.980 --> 09:27.460
I don't care! I'll drill him!

09:27.700 --> 09:29.580
Get out of here, before he kills you!

09:29.820 --> 09:32.220
- Go that way! Not that way!
- This way! Over here!

09:32.460 --> 09:33.340
- Run!
- Now!

09:33.580 --> 09:36.420
Run!

09:45.420 --> 09:46.860
Wait a minute!

09:47.100 --> 09:50.100
You forgot to sign.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.620
What was that?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.540
Wait a minute.
You forgot to sign the form.

09:55.780 --> 09:56.620
Who are you?

09:56.860 --> 09:58.100
You're not the regular guy?

09:58.340 --> 10:00.620
- He's on vacation.
- On vacation?

10:00.860 --> 10:03.020
Well, who the hell is that?

10:03.260 --> 10:06.140
Get in the truck.

10:12.060 --> 10:14.980
You fucking prick!

10:21.020 --> 10:22.340
Are you a cop?

10:22.580 --> 10:25.420
Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.
Will continue transmission.

10:25.660 --> 10:26.540
Call 911.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.660
Okay, honey. Let me drive.
We're in pursuit.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.220
I'm driving! Don't worry.

10:38.380 --> 10:41.260
This fool picked the wrong time
to mess with the wrong lady.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.420
Just stay close.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.980
Right behind you, baby!

10:51.220 --> 10:52.340
Take a good look!

10:52.580 --> 10:56.940
Delores the Road Warrior
is dead on your raggedy ass!

11:03.900 --> 11:06.580
Ram him!

11:11.300 --> 11:13.860
- Watch out, Riggs!
- Come on!

11:21.580 --> 11:22.940
Are you married, sugar?

11:23.180 --> 11:24.980
What? Yes, 24 years. 24 years!

11:25.220 --> 11:28.100
Yeah, but is it working?

11:32.220 --> 11:36.420
- You can't get closer?
- I am. I'm getting closer.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.860
Hold on, Riggs!

11:48.420 --> 11:50.140
Hold on! We got you!

11:50.380 --> 11:52.340
Hold on!

11:52.580 --> 11:54.460
- I told you I could do it!
- Closer!

11:54.700 --> 11:56.420
- Get me up there!
- Go!

11:56.660 --> 11:59.260
I am!

12:02.900 --> 12:05.380
Back off!

12:15.940 --> 12:17.220
If he falls, don't hit him.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.980
Don't worry, I've got something for you.

12:56.700 --> 13:01.140
Thanks for the interest, sugar,
but one thing at a time.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.420
- Catch him!
- All right!

13:17.660 --> 13:21.220
Keep singing. Just stay close.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.340
Relax, baby. Relax.

13:28.580 --> 13:30.460
Keep your hands off my thighs!

13:30.700 --> 13:34.500
- He's in trouble. Watch out!
- I got him!

13:45.580 --> 13:47.020
I'm getting too old for this.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.660
Not for me, you're not, sugar.

13:52.460 --> 13:55.100
You have the right to remain unconscious.

13:55.340 --> 13:59.220
Anything you say ain't gonna be much.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.340
Hey, Riggs. Are you all right?

14:03.580 --> 14:07.420
I'm okay. I think we've got to book
this guy for not wearing his seat belt.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.420
That was dynamite driving.

14:09.660 --> 14:13.500
- She's a dynamite driver.
- I'll show you dynamite.

14:13.740 --> 14:16.220
Sho 'nuff!

14:16.460 --> 14:18.220
What have you two been up to?

14:18.460 --> 14:20.180
What do you mean? We were in pursuit.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.340
- I saw you kiss her.
- I didn't. She kissed me.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.420
It looked mutual to me.
Wipe that lipstick off...

14:25.660 --> 14:29.140
Hey, go spit, Riggs.

14:29.420 --> 14:30.460
Are you okay?

14:30.700 --> 14:32.300
Are you all right?

14:32.540 --> 14:34.500
Back to bed. Back to bed.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.780
Good morning, guys. Daddy.

14:37.020 --> 14:40.660
How about treating your dad
to breakfast today?

14:40.900 --> 14:45.260
- You've got six more days to go.
- Laundry service.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.700
Hold this. Hangers?

14:46.940 --> 14:50.140
I'm springing for the soap.
Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.900
It's a Westie.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.740
'Morning, Trish.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.700
'Morning, Rog.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.460
- Good morning, Nick.
- Spare me.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.140
- What, you didn't brush your teeth?
- Hold it, mister.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.060
Just looking for some orange juice.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.780
Don't get any fingerprints on the door
and put the glass in the dishwasher.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.500
Did somebody commit a murder?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.340
Someone's coming to see the house.

15:09.580 --> 15:12.780
A little mess adds to the charm.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.340
How's this?

15:23.580 --> 15:26.380
Isn't this great? Okay?

15:26.620 --> 15:27.820
Kelly's Pool Hall.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.780
Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.

15:31.020 --> 15:34.700
Hi, honey. How are you?
I thought I asked you not to call me here.

15:34.940 --> 15:38.300
- It's for you.
- Me?

15:39.340 --> 15:40.900
Who is it? Hello?

15:41.140 --> 15:44.620
Hi. It's my first day at work. Are you
going to come by and wish me luck?

15:44.860 --> 15:47.820
- Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.
- Beautiful lawn.

15:48.060 --> 15:49.180
It's great.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.380
See how quiet it is here? Listen.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.020
Isn't that great? Come on.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.180
- It's quiet.
- The inside's even better.

15:55.420 --> 15:59.940
- It's the people to look at the house.
- And our broker.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.220
Just want to make sure.

16:03.460 --> 16:07.540
I'll show you this room first.
It's my favorite.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.380
Is that it? Does that say it all?

16:09.620 --> 16:10.460
It's very nice.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.460
I love that picture window.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.980
- It's just been completely replaced.
- Why?

16:16.220 --> 16:19.100
A drug dealer came through with his car
and crashed right in.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.820
Shot up the whole place.

16:21.060 --> 16:25.100
Son of a bitch!
I'm going to cut him off at the knees.

16:25.340 --> 16:28.500
It's true. It's true. True.
Okay, anyway, look.

16:28.740 --> 16:31.020
Do you like the drapes?
Maybe she'll leave them.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.940
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

16:33.180 --> 16:36.700
- You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.
- I'm itching to.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.620
Here.

16:38.860 --> 16:40.220
Chew on these.

16:40.460 --> 16:44.140
I have to tell you this. It's the law.
It's called "full disclosure".

16:44.380 --> 16:47.740
Anything else you want to disclose
before we go on?

16:47.980 --> 16:51.180
Now that you mention it, the bathroom
has been completely remodeled...

16:51.420 --> 16:53.060
...due to unexpected bomb damage.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.620
Hey, come on. It's okay.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.140
Son of a bitch!

16:56.380 --> 17:00.420
Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.

17:03.740 --> 17:06.780
Okay. We saw enough of the kitchen.
I'll show you the upstairs.

17:07.020 --> 17:11.260
Wait till you see it.
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

17:15.020 --> 17:17.540
They're gone. Leo Getz,
I'm going to kill him.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.980
Son of a bitch. I'm going to kill him!

17:20.220 --> 17:23.619
You have to let me, Riggs!

17:24.099 --> 17:25.740
They weren't going to buy it anyway!

17:25.980 --> 17:28.900
- You scared them away!
- They couldn't afford to buy it!

17:29.140 --> 17:31.420
- Oh, I see.
- Okay, relax.

17:31.660 --> 17:34.860
I had to tell them everything.
It's the law. "Full disclosure."

17:35.100 --> 17:38.060
- You must have heard of it?
- I'm a cop. I'm the law!

17:38.300 --> 17:41.820
- Get off me! What is it with you?
- Hold it!

17:42.060 --> 17:43.060
Okay, okay.

17:43.300 --> 17:47.140
At least he didn't tell them
about the nail-gun incident.

17:47.380 --> 17:50.380
I forgot. Did you have a permit
when you built over the garage?

17:50.620 --> 17:51.580
Permit?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.100
Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.180
I'll make some calls.
We'll get some back-dated permits.

17:57.420 --> 18:01.300
- Which phone can I use?
- Sunroom.

18:02.380 --> 18:04.860
- It must be easier than this.
- Count on Leo Getz.

18:05.100 --> 18:08.300
You need less aggravation.
Come to work with me.

18:08.540 --> 18:12.140
Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.860
Did you forget something?

18:31.020 --> 18:31.900
This.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.220
You wear it. You sleep in it. You eat in it.

18:34.460 --> 18:35.100
Okay?

18:35.340 --> 18:37.260
Six more days.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.540
And you...

18:38.780 --> 18:40.580
...keep an eye on him.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.980
Sure.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.300
She loves me.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.740
Stop fronting yourself.
You know what I'm saying?

18:50.980 --> 18:54.340
Swing with me and my crew.

18:57.140 --> 19:00.340
- I got school.
- Forget school.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.300
Here comes your pops.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.220
- Later.
- All right, gotcha.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.500
Next time.

19:12.020 --> 19:15.540
- 'Morning, Rog.
- How are you doing?

19:16.020 --> 19:17.940
Hey, Nick?

19:18.180 --> 19:19.740
- Wasn't that Darryl?
- Yeah.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.580
I haven't seen him around in a while.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.260
He dropped out of high school.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.460
Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.020
Yeah, I know.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.140
Hey, Nick?

19:31.380 --> 19:32.300
Yeah, Dad?

19:32.540 --> 19:34.140
Be good.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.740
Word.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.340
"Word", Nick.

19:39.580 --> 19:42.180
Word.

19:43.740 --> 19:44.700
"Word", Riggs.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.500
"Word", Rog.

19:46.740 --> 19:48.340
- What are we talking about?
- "Word."

19:48.580 --> 19:51.620
Four letters. Starts with a "W",
"O" in the middle, "D" at the end.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.980
Oh, yeah, that word.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.660
"Word."

20:08.220 --> 20:11.020
- Tyrone, my man, how are you?
- Jack, how's it going?

20:11.260 --> 20:13.220
- Let's take a walk.
- Wait here for me.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.980
Look around. This is my dream
and it's all coming true.

20:16.220 --> 20:20.580
You sank your money into this,
out here in the middle of the desert?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.020
- Know why it'll be a gold mine?
- Do tell.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.780
Because no one wants to live
next door to a menace like you.

20:27.020 --> 20:30.020
I came to do business,
not to be insulted by you.

20:30.260 --> 20:31.620
Relax, Tyrone.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.340
Like houses,
friendships need strong foundations.

20:34.580 --> 20:38.420
Smitty, come here. Come here.

20:39.420 --> 20:42.420
What's wrong with you?
Don't I pay you good and take care of you?

20:42.660 --> 20:45.900
- Sure you do.
- What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?

20:46.140 --> 20:49.100
- It was a good plan. It worked.
- It worked? It didn't work.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.860
You got nailed, first time out.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.780
Nobody who works for me
goes into business for themselves.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.820
Do you understand me?
See how that can jeopardize everything?

20:57.060 --> 20:59.180
- Right?
- Whatever.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.900
Especially trying to pop an armored car.

21:02.140 --> 21:05.460
Okay, Billy got caught.
There's nothing I can do about that now.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.140
He'll have to face the music on his own.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.860
But you and me...

21:10.100 --> 21:11.460
...we're gonna start over.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.020
You know what I mean?

21:14.260 --> 21:15.980
- Whatever you say.
- Good.

21:16.220 --> 21:20.140
Glad you understand
what I'm talking about.

21:24.580 --> 21:28.460
Now we've got a relationship
we can build on.

21:29.020 --> 21:32.140
- Employee problems. You know how it is?
- Yeah, right.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.700
You invest time and energy
into training somebody.

21:34.940 --> 21:38.420
Then they get greedy and do something
stupid that jeopardizes everything.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.700
It's a bitch!

21:39.940 --> 21:41.980
Stick around. This is the good part.

21:42.220 --> 21:45.300
We can put our initials in there.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.380
Jesus Christ!

21:50.340 --> 21:52.780
Lankershim and Vineland.
Where are we going?

21:53.020 --> 21:56.500
Right here. Rianne's got a new job.
I promised her I'd stop by.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.860
That's a good reason.

21:59.100 --> 22:03.140
All right. Here we are.

22:07.580 --> 22:10.580
- You got any silver, any change?
- We're cops.

22:10.820 --> 22:15.620
That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.
I'll get change.

22:23.460 --> 22:26.660
Get down! All of you!

22:28.940 --> 22:31.740
Get down!

22:46.460 --> 22:47.620
How do you like me?

22:47.860 --> 22:50.060
What are you doing with a rubber gun?

22:50.300 --> 22:51.420
This is a film.

22:51.660 --> 22:54.540
Cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?

22:54.780 --> 22:57.140
- Get him off my set.
- This isn't part of the story.

22:57.380 --> 23:00.660
- Where did you come from?
- Can we get a cop on set?

23:00.900 --> 23:03.980
Rianne, I'm so sorry.
I feel like a microbe right now.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.860
- You really thought I was in trouble?
- I did.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.620
A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.940
- Are you a fucking idiot?
- I apologize.

23:12.180 --> 23:15.260
He's a friend of mine, a policeman.
He thought I was in trouble.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.500
We're both...

23:16.740 --> 23:17.940
He's a friend of yours?

23:18.180 --> 23:21.220
Let me tell you something:
You're fired. Have a nice day.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.780
Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?

23:24.020 --> 23:25.140
You're not fired.

23:25.380 --> 23:27.500
No, you're not. Just take it easy.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.740
You can't fire her for something I did.

23:29.980 --> 23:32.060
I don't care whose mistake it was.
She's fired.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.500
I apologize to everyone.

23:33.740 --> 23:34.740
Don't push him!

23:34.980 --> 23:36.100
All of you, go!

23:36.340 --> 23:38.020
Just take it easy. Don't push him.

23:38.260 --> 23:41.300
Get off my set, all right?
What are you, deaf?

23:41.540 --> 23:42.340
Get off my set!

23:42.580 --> 23:44.780
On any normal day,
I'd smack you in the mouth.

23:45.020 --> 23:45.820
Is that so?

23:46.060 --> 23:46.700
Don't!

23:46.940 --> 23:48.620
It's a normal day.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.460
I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay? I'm sorry.

23:51.700 --> 23:54.780
I'm all thumbs. He fell down.
Let me help you.

23:55.020 --> 23:56.420
I said don't hit him!

23:56.660 --> 23:58.380
- Is she fired?
- Yes, she's fired.

23:58.620 --> 23:59.740
- Is she fired?
- No, no.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.580
- It's okay.
- Does she get a raise?

24:01.820 --> 24:03.820
- Yes. I said, "yes".
- Good.

24:04.060 --> 24:07.540
Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.140
We'd like you to come back.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.140
You can't settle every problem
with your fists.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.260
- I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.
- Six more days.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.060
I don't want to hear that anymore.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.860
Did Rianne get her job back?
Did she get a raise?

24:24.100 --> 24:25.900
I don't hear a "thank you".

24:26.140 --> 24:30.060
Maybe I should become a Hollywood agent.
What do you think?

24:30.300 --> 24:31.900
- It won't work.
- Why?

24:32.140 --> 24:34.060
You don't have that killer instinct.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.140
Son of a bitch!

24:36.380 --> 24:40.260
- We should've put a bag on the meter.
- I'll put it in the glove compartment.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.860
I don't do that anymore.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.340
Oh, yeah? Good man.

24:43.580 --> 24:47.180
It's full. Put it in the back seat.

24:49.500 --> 24:54.060
- You really like those things?
- These? They're good.

24:55.060 --> 24:59.460
You can eat a box of them
and still be dying for a cigarette.

25:01.540 --> 25:04.340
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- Yeah.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.220
Old razor?

25:06.460 --> 25:09.100
Old face.

25:09.660 --> 25:13.180
You're letting this retirement thing
get you down.

25:13.420 --> 25:16.140
Spend a few more years
getting used to the idea. Why quit?

25:16.380 --> 25:18.940
- I've got plans for my retirement.
- Oh, yeah, plans.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.740
- I do. Big plans.
- Big plans?

25:20.980 --> 25:22.980
- I've had them for a long time.
- Like what?

25:23.220 --> 25:25.580
Like...

25:25.820 --> 25:28.020
- Things, man.
- Things.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.060
Things.

25:29.300 --> 25:30.820
Things I've put off for too long.

25:31.060 --> 25:33.780
Oh, those things. I've got those, too.

25:34.020 --> 25:37.860
I see you've given this a lot of thought.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.700
Yeah.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.420
I've given it a lot of thought.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.860
Goddamn it!

26:03.100 --> 26:06.020
- What's going on?
- I'm pissed off. You need a reason?

26:06.260 --> 26:09.900
- I thought I heard gunfire.
- Get your hearing checked! Put that away!

26:10.140 --> 26:11.300
What are you looking at?

26:11.540 --> 26:14.540
Hey, man. Peace.

26:34.460 --> 26:38.020
Why'd you call us down here?

26:38.780 --> 26:39.980
How are you doing, son?

26:40.220 --> 26:43.940
Does your mother know you're here?

26:45.980 --> 26:48.140
- Did you do this?
- Nice shooting.

26:48.380 --> 26:50.380
Better than Billy the Kid.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.420
Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?

26:52.660 --> 26:55.580
Give it to your mom.
Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.

26:55.820 --> 26:57.700
- Can I borrow your glasses?
- Yeah.

26:57.940 --> 26:58.940
Who's wearing?

26:59.180 --> 27:00.340
Roger, you are.

27:00.580 --> 27:02.260
Why me? You guys should be wearing.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.020
Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.

27:04.260 --> 27:07.020
I don't need help.
I've been dressing myself since I was 30.

27:07.260 --> 27:09.260
- Okay, man, just trying to help.
- Get back.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.060
All you perverts, turn your heads.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.700
- Take it off, baby.
- Hold this shirt.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.460
You're wearing a girdle.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.700
- He's got a girdle.
- This is not a girdle.

27:18.940 --> 27:20.620
This is not a girdle. It's my back.

27:20.860 --> 27:23.580
My back went out on me.

27:23.660 --> 27:27.420
I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
What are you talking about?

27:27.660 --> 27:28.780
I saw him do it.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.300
Everybody, listen up.

27:30.540 --> 27:33.180
I want you all to look at these.
Lovely bullets.

27:33.420 --> 27:33.980
Cute.

27:34.220 --> 27:39.100
Notice the smooth jacket.
Pay particular attention to the tip.

27:42.140 --> 27:47.220
Now, you've all seen these vests stop
a.357 Magnum bullet.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.700
Observe.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.100
Son of a bitch.

28:08.740 --> 28:12.500
- Armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah, cop killers.

28:12.740 --> 28:16.420
Those bullets came from the gun
of a suspect we arrested yesterday.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.500
They're out there on the streets.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.740
Vests are optional, boys and girls.
Especially boys.

28:21.980 --> 28:24.740
See you, Riggs.

28:25.820 --> 28:28.580
Cop killers.

28:29.380 --> 28:32.300
Son of a bitch.

28:33.300 --> 28:39.100
I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.
I'll have him brought in for interrogation.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.140
I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.

28:48.380 --> 28:51.020
- Can I see your ID, please?
- Sure.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.460
William Phelps, armored car suspect.
He's been moved to Interrogation.

28:54.700 --> 28:59.020
- Do you know where that is?
- Sure. I've been there a lot.

29:06.660 --> 29:09.700
Same floor.

29:09.980 --> 29:14.980
I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss
bank account will come in pretty handy.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.780
How much you got in there, $1 million?
$1.5 million?

29:18.020 --> 29:19.660
- $5 million.
- $5 million?

29:19.900 --> 29:21.580
Well, you deserve it.

29:21.820 --> 29:26.180
It's better than those
miserable drug dealers getting it.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.420
What are you talking about?

29:30.660 --> 29:34.380
Don't sweat it. You laundered it,
didn't you? They can't trace it.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.260
- They can't trace it.
- What?

29:36.500 --> 29:39.540
So long as I get an invite
to "casa de" Murtaugh, I'm happy.

29:39.780 --> 29:40.780
"Casa" what?

29:41.020 --> 29:43.180
- I've never been to Portugal.
- Stop joking.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.300
She's a cop.

29:44.540 --> 29:48.260
I know she's a cop.
She's probably on the take, too.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.220
The whole Force is bent.

29:50.460 --> 29:52.940
She may be wearing a skirt,
but we're all brothers.

29:53.180 --> 29:56.380
You know I have nothing.
I ain't been to Portugal.

29:56.620 --> 30:00.100
Listen to me.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.780
Son of a bitch.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.740
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

30:05.980 --> 30:09.420
- Who is it today?
- Billy Phelps.

30:09.460 --> 30:10.340
Who are you?

30:10.580 --> 30:13.660
Fly me. I'm your friendly
Portuguese airline.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.100
She's Infernal Affairs.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.140
How'd you know?

30:16.380 --> 30:19.820
I took the liberty
of looking at your file folder.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.860
Lorna Cole.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.780
- And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.
- I used to be.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.820
What's Infernal Repairs
want with our collar?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.380
We're taking over, thanks.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.380
Nobody told us they were taking over.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.660
Nobody has to tell you anything,
Patrolman.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.620
I want to go and see the captain.

30:35.860 --> 30:38.340
You want to see the captain?
Let's go see the captain.

30:38.580 --> 30:41.020
- And put on a vest.
- Oh, are you wearing one?

30:41.260 --> 30:44.740
Just take it easy, man.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.860
Hey, guys. Phelps, William.
Actually, his name's Billy.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.220
You, too?

30:59.460 --> 31:01.300
- Popular guy today.
- Somebody with him?

31:01.540 --> 31:04.460
No, not really.
He's down the hall to the right.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.060
Want to sign in here, Sarge?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.540
Miss.

31:08.780 --> 31:12.220
- What's Internal Affairs doing here?
- Don't start. I just found out myself.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.620
This is Herman Walters,
Chief of Intelligence.

31:14.860 --> 31:16.780
You haven't met his daughter,
Lorna Doone.

31:17.020 --> 31:18.100
Pleased to meet you.

31:18.340 --> 31:21.060
The Phelps case has been transferred
to Internal Affairs.

31:21.300 --> 31:21.980
Why?

31:22.220 --> 31:24.020
- I can't tell you.
- That's classified.

31:24.260 --> 31:26.620
We busted our buns busting this guy.
We busted him.

31:26.860 --> 31:29.260
Busted is right.
He spent the night in the hospital.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.380
- He didn't buckle up.
- We even cited him.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.340
I know, I read your report.

31:33.580 --> 31:35.860
Our cases have, unfortunately,
crossed paths here.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.300
That's all I can say.
We'll take over from here.

31:38.540 --> 31:40.620
Captain, what is she talking about here?

31:40.860 --> 31:43.300
- That's classified.
- No, I'm talking to him.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.580
I'm telling you...

31:44.820 --> 31:47.220
No, I said, "Captain".
I'm talking to the captain.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.220
- That's classified.
- I'm talking to him.

31:50.460 --> 31:53.300
That's bullshit!

31:53.900 --> 31:56.460
Maybe these guys
can contribute something to this case?

31:56.700 --> 31:59.460
From their records,
they only contribute mayhem and chaos.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.860
No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.
We're a double act.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.140
What are we,
required reading or something?

32:04.380 --> 32:05.820
As a matter of fact, you are.

32:06.060 --> 32:08.580
It's a cross between "Police Gazette"
and "Mad" magazine.

32:08.820 --> 32:11.500
- What's wrong with "Mad"?
- Nothing, I used to read it...

32:11.740 --> 32:13.100
You've got some taste.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.540
...when I was 12.

32:15.780 --> 32:17.140
- Riggs, let's go.
- I'm out of here.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.180
We busted him, we can talk to him.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.460
- Captain.
- Riggs. Murtaugh.

32:21.700 --> 32:25.180
Get your asses back here.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.940
You'll be needing these.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.340
I'm reinstating both of you.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.900
- Don't you just love him?
- Yeah.

32:34.140 --> 32:36.620
God!

32:37.100 --> 32:38.700
You really are a beautiful man.

32:38.940 --> 32:40.180
Just get rid of the blues.

32:40.420 --> 32:44.620
- They don't go with your ponytail.
- Absolutely not.

32:44.780 --> 32:45.620
Yeah, right.

32:45.860 --> 32:46.700
Get a haircut!

32:46.940 --> 32:48.020
Of course, I won't.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.140
You've exceeded your authority, Captain.

32:50.380 --> 32:53.140
- That's not how I see it.
- That's how the chief will see it.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.260
- Take it up with him.
- I think I will.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.740
Catch up with them. We don't want this
screwed up with cowboy tactics.

32:58.980 --> 33:01.580
Son of a bitch.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.900
Hi, Billy.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.140
Jack.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.900
'Bye, Billy.

33:15.780 --> 33:18.820
See you, Billy.

33:23.780 --> 33:25.540
Sergeant, did you get what you need?

33:25.780 --> 33:29.580
Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.

33:29.820 --> 33:31.700
How long has Phelps been doing this?

33:31.940 --> 33:34.580
- Doing what?
- This armored-car thing.

33:34.820 --> 33:39.140
I wouldn't know.
I'm not interested in armored cars.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.660
I don't think she's telling us everything.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.020
I think you're right.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.620
Boy, these six days are going to be rough.

33:56.860 --> 34:00.100
God, be good to me, please.

34:00.860 --> 34:04.660
Shit, son of a bitch knew there was
a camera in the wall.

34:04.900 --> 34:05.580
Damn it!

34:05.820 --> 34:08.260
He didn't know there was one
in the interrogation room.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.179
There isn't.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.060
We installed them six months ago.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.739
- Every station.
- That's great.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.739
Six months and we don't know about it?

34:15.980 --> 34:17.699
This is the "police police", Captain.

34:17.940 --> 34:21.500
"Police police." Very good. Can you say
that three times in a row, real fast?

34:21.739 --> 34:24.179
- Why? Am I getting to you?
- Are you trying to bait me?

34:24.420 --> 34:25.540
I'm a master at it.

34:25.780 --> 34:26.659
That figures.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.300
Baiting master. Great, man,
try all the tricks.

34:29.540 --> 34:31.060
Freeze that. Stop it.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.620
Jack Travis.

34:32.860 --> 34:33.620
Who?

34:33.860 --> 34:36.860
Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.060
He was one of us.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.219
Hell of a brutal cop.
He could beat a confession out of anyone.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.739
One hell of a dirty cop.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.460
I've never seen so many suspensions
and reprimands and charges of misconduct.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.940
He's also as tough as they come.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.300
What happened to him?

34:50.540 --> 34:51.500
I don't know.

34:51.739 --> 34:55.380
His partner and him were on a stakeout.
He went for coffee, never came back.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.980
Looks like he's had
one cappuccino too many.

34:58.220 --> 34:59.900
We'd better brief Walters.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.100
Excuse me, cute stuff.

35:02.340 --> 35:05.380
- That's harassment.
- "Cute stuff." That's you.

35:05.620 --> 35:08.860
- Captain.
- Boys. It's just the captain.

35:09.100 --> 35:12.340
Your involvement in this case ended
when Phelps hit the floor.

35:12.580 --> 35:15.540
Why don't you just go back
and beat your street?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.540
- Now's the time to buy.
- Not now.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.620
- Hey, Roger.
- Not now, Leo.

35:20.860 --> 35:23.180
- Not now!
- We got to talk, babe, okay?

35:23.420 --> 35:25.420
You're in trouble. You've got termites.

35:25.660 --> 35:26.700
Termites?

35:26.940 --> 35:28.860
- Oh, God!
- You're infested!

35:29.100 --> 35:31.420
The only thing holding up your house
is the paint.

35:31.660 --> 35:32.540
We should go.

35:32.780 --> 35:34.620
Leo, could you get the place fumigated?

35:34.860 --> 35:36.980
We should pull every file on this guy.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.340
I know this guy.
Are you watching "Geraldo"?

35:39.580 --> 35:40.860
- What?
- I know the guy.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.540
- How do you know him?
- I've seen the guy before.

35:43.780 --> 35:45.780
- Where?
- I don't know. I recognize him...

35:46.020 --> 35:49.140
His name is Jack Travis.
Does that ring a bell?

35:49.380 --> 35:51.380
Hands off the clothes. Okay?

35:51.620 --> 35:53.940
I'm thinking. Let me think.

35:54.180 --> 35:55.540
It was a big party.

35:55.780 --> 35:58.860
Someone brought a monkey
that knocked over the salad bar.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.140
And this guy comes in
and introduces me to another guy...

36:02.380 --> 36:04.340
...who wants a favor.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.100
- I got it!
- What?

36:06.340 --> 36:07.380
He's got it!

36:07.620 --> 36:09.500
- I remember!
- You remember!

36:09.740 --> 36:12.620
Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.

36:12.860 --> 36:14.900
- We're back. We're back!
- Yeah.

36:15.140 --> 36:18.980
Listen. Can I have a gun this time?

36:28.260 --> 36:32.740
Okay, this is it! These guys always
wanted me to do favors for them!

36:32.980 --> 36:36.500
Like, some guys wanted broads,
another guy wanted Cuban cigars.

36:36.740 --> 36:38.340
Your guy, hockey.

36:38.580 --> 36:41.860
The best seats in the house.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.580
- Where're the seats?
- Yeah?

36:45.820 --> 36:48.060
Probably by the glass.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.660
Does "needle in a haystack"
mean anything to you?

36:50.900 --> 36:52.180
Why don't we spread out?

36:52.420 --> 36:56.700
If we all take a different direction,
it'd be like old times.

36:56.940 --> 36:59.580
Don't push, lady.
I'm on police business here.

36:59.820 --> 37:03.020
Just take it easy.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.340
Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.300
Two minutes for high-sticking.

37:33.540 --> 37:37.060
Time, 5:15.

37:53.580 --> 37:56.220
Mr. Jack Travis?

37:56.460 --> 38:00.220
Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.

38:00.460 --> 38:01.780
We know you're in here.

38:02.020 --> 38:04.060
We know where you are.
Just stay in your seat.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.580
Don't be stupid.

38:05.820 --> 38:07.940
I'll be there to escort you out in a minute.

38:08.180 --> 38:11.180
There's a policeman at every exit,
so it's no use trying to run.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.380
Smart son of a bitch.

38:12.620 --> 38:13.900
Just stay where you are.

38:14.140 --> 38:17.700
Thanks for your cooperation.
Play on, boys.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.660
Come on, let's go!

38:41.500 --> 38:44.780
Get out of my fucking way!

38:55.100 --> 38:57.700
Excuse me.

39:08.540 --> 39:11.460
You can't be on the ice!

39:16.740 --> 39:19.780
I got him!

39:20.620 --> 39:24.940
You have the right... You're under arrest!

39:31.900 --> 39:32.780
Fucking weasel!

39:33.020 --> 39:34.700
What the hell's going on here?

39:34.940 --> 39:36.460
I'm LAPD!

39:36.700 --> 39:40.420
I don't care. You can't be on the ice.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.140
I got him!

39:46.380 --> 39:49.860
You're all right, pal. Stay calm.

39:50.980 --> 39:52.620
Make sure you tell my mother.

39:52.860 --> 39:53.940
Where'd he go?

39:54.180 --> 39:56.860
Down there.

40:05.060 --> 40:08.260
Son of a bitch!

40:09.740 --> 40:12.740
He thinks I don't know I'm dying.
I know it.

40:12.980 --> 40:15.980
- You'll be okay.
- I'm dying, Roger.

40:16.220 --> 40:17.780
I'm choking, see?

40:18.020 --> 40:19.860
This is what they do when they die.

40:20.100 --> 40:23.460
Leo, it's going to be okay.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.420
My body's numb. I can't feel it.

40:25.660 --> 40:28.500
I'm going to die, I know it. What?

40:28.740 --> 40:31.940
You're lying on the ice.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.380
- That's why I'm cold?
- That's why you're cold.

40:34.620 --> 40:36.820
- That's why I'm numb?
- That's why you're numb.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.860
But he shot me. Look at all the blood.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.980
- It's just a flesh wound.
- So it's okay.

40:46.660 --> 40:51.620
He's okay. He's going to make it.
He's alive!

40:55.300 --> 40:59.660
- Bring him this way.
- I can't believe this.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.740
- I can't believe I got shot.
- Calm down.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.020
Riggs, are you here?

41:03.260 --> 41:05.780
We're all the same now. We all got shot.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.540
You'll be fine.

41:07.780 --> 41:08.420
Relax.

41:08.660 --> 41:11.340
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.
I can take this.

41:11.580 --> 41:14.580
Calm down. We'll take care of it.
You'll be out of here tonight.

41:14.820 --> 41:15.740
It's no big deal.

41:15.980 --> 41:18.460
That's not a good idea.
You shouldn't rush this, Doc.

41:18.700 --> 41:19.700
You should rest up.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.740
A dum-dum wound can be serious.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.740
What's a "dum-dum wound"?

41:23.980 --> 41:27.660
You don't know? A guy on the Force
got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.940
From the shock,
he was dead two days later.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.500
"Dead two days later"?

41:31.740 --> 41:33.060
He died from dum-dums?

41:33.300 --> 41:35.540
- We'll keep you overnight.
- Make it two.

41:35.780 --> 41:36.620
Two days?

41:36.860 --> 41:38.540
Okay, we'll keep him in two days.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.260
Is that Leo's chart?

41:40.500 --> 41:43.500
- Two days, then you'll be as good as new.
- I should be with them.

41:43.740 --> 41:45.900
I should be with...

41:46.140 --> 41:47.700
How do you spell, "proctological"?

41:47.940 --> 41:49.620
Rectal exam?

41:49.860 --> 41:52.500
- No, you can't do that to Leo.
- Sure, we can.

41:52.740 --> 41:53.500
Why's she...

41:53.740 --> 41:55.380
Please, Mr. Getz.

41:55.620 --> 41:58.740
You've been shot in the arm?
Let her take it. You'll get it back.

41:58.980 --> 42:02.380
There's a clock in your room.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.260
Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?

42:04.500 --> 42:06.740
- It sounded like one when it happened.
- Shit.

42:06.980 --> 42:10.700
- Take it easy. Two days.
- Two days and you'll be out. No problem.

42:10.940 --> 42:13.540
- I'll see you guys.
- We won't make a move without you.

42:13.780 --> 42:15.740
I thought that bullet sounded different.

42:15.980 --> 42:18.500
- Relax. They'll be there when you get out.
- I'm fine.

42:18.740 --> 42:20.500
- You own your house, Doc?
- What?

42:20.740 --> 42:22.500
- You don't recognize my face?
- No, sir.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.420
Watch.

42:24.660 --> 42:25.140
It's about time.

42:25.380 --> 42:28.020
These doggy treats are okay,
but I need some human food.

42:28.260 --> 42:31.500
Don't worry. I'll make you the best thing
you've ever had.

42:31.740 --> 42:34.180
Good.

42:34.420 --> 42:38.420
- You ever eaten one of my hamburgers?
- I've been lucky so far.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.700
Hey, Fast Eddie.

42:39.940 --> 42:42.020
- How's business?
- Booming. Can't you tell?

42:42.260 --> 42:44.540
Yeah, I'm looking at it.
Did you meet my partner?

42:44.780 --> 42:47.220
I want to cook one
of those monster burgers for him.

42:47.460 --> 42:48.780
- Go for it.
- All right.

42:49.020 --> 42:50.140
You'll let him cook?

42:50.380 --> 42:52.900
- Do I have a choice?
- No, because it's Wednesday.

42:53.140 --> 42:54.740
He's too big to argue with.

42:54.980 --> 42:56.780
In that case, give me a MacRog.

42:57.020 --> 42:58.660
Hold the hair.

42:58.900 --> 43:00.060
Did you wash your hands?

43:00.300 --> 43:03.660
Keep joking. But I guarantee
you're gonna like this burger...

43:03.900 --> 43:07.540
...and you're gonna come back
with your friends.

43:07.780 --> 43:11.060
I haven't got any friends,
you know that, except you.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.780
He's a comedian in his spare time.

43:14.020 --> 43:15.900
When is he gonna say something funny?

43:16.140 --> 43:17.460
Are you gonna put that out?

43:17.700 --> 43:19.220
You're finished with it, yeah?

43:19.460 --> 43:22.620
Do you mind? Thanks.

43:23.140 --> 43:25.180
Sorry. I was just looking at it.

43:25.420 --> 43:27.940
Chew on this onion.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.580
He's quitting, so help him.

43:30.820 --> 43:33.980
I was only looking at it.

43:35.300 --> 43:36.820
The first thing is the fat.

43:37.060 --> 43:39.380
Everyone says, "Cut the fat".

43:39.620 --> 43:42.540
My uncle said, "You cut the fat,
you kill the burger". Right?

43:42.780 --> 43:43.260
Yeah.

43:43.500 --> 43:48.220
There's an art to it.
You just can't plop this on the grill.

43:49.060 --> 43:52.740
Gently coax the flavors out.

43:53.540 --> 43:56.860
Hey, what's the problem?

44:01.900 --> 44:05.220
A little pepper,
then you massage it a little bit.

44:05.460 --> 44:06.540
Just a little bit.

44:06.780 --> 44:10.620
"Sweet, sweet meat"

44:11.700 --> 44:14.940
Shit, man, feel it.

44:16.980 --> 44:18.180
Okay, guys!

44:18.420 --> 44:20.020
LAPD. Let me see your hands.

44:20.260 --> 44:22.380
Let me see your hands. Get them up!

44:22.620 --> 44:27.660
In the car! Get them up there!
Let me see both of them! Come on!

44:30.380 --> 44:32.900
Hey, Riggs!

44:41.660 --> 44:45.420
Don't you love me? Five days.

44:51.620 --> 44:52.900
Don't do that to me.

44:53.140 --> 44:54.860
- Riggs, are you okay?
- Yeah.

44:55.100 --> 44:57.820
Who did it?

44:58.660 --> 44:59.860
All right, asshole!

45:00.100 --> 45:03.740
I want to see your hands, right now!

45:27.460 --> 45:30.300
Back me up, Riggs.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.220
Darryl?

46:02.220 --> 46:04.740
Fuck, no!

46:06.460 --> 46:09.860
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance! Breathe!

46:10.100 --> 46:11.780
Please, breathe.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.140
Breathe!

46:13.380 --> 46:15.940
Call an ambulance!

46:16.180 --> 46:18.220
Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!

46:18.460 --> 46:21.460
Fuck, it's Darryl!

46:21.900 --> 46:23.700
Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!

46:23.940 --> 46:26.260
- He's dead.
- Breathe!

46:26.500 --> 46:28.820
- God, don't do this!
- He's dead.

46:29.060 --> 46:31.180
Rog, he's dead!

46:31.420 --> 46:33.940
He's dead, Rog.
Don't mess with the corpse.

46:34.180 --> 46:37.140
He's dead. Come on, man,
it was a clean shoot.

46:37.380 --> 46:39.220
It's okay, it was a clean shoot.

46:39.460 --> 46:41.460
He was gonna do you
and he was gonna do me.

46:41.700 --> 46:43.740
It's okay. Are you okay?

46:43.980 --> 46:46.420
It's not okay.

46:46.660 --> 46:49.580
I know that kid.

46:50.740 --> 46:53.100
I know that kid.

46:53.340 --> 46:56.460
He's Nick's friend.

47:11.860 --> 47:14.060
- I got it, Mom.
- I'll get it.

47:14.300 --> 47:15.460
Hello?

47:15.700 --> 47:17.380
Hi, Martin.

47:17.620 --> 47:20.380
He's not here.

47:26.180 --> 47:29.340
Oh, my God!

47:30.740 --> 47:33.500
Thanks.

48:00.580 --> 48:03.100
Fuck!

48:07.540 --> 48:09.300
How are you doing? Taking your vitamins?

48:09.540 --> 48:12.820
- Riggs, how's Murtaugh?
- He's good. He's fine.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.820
- I'm sure he's anything but fine.
- Really, he's okay.

48:16.060 --> 48:19.300
- I'd really like to talk to him.
- That's not such a good idea.

48:19.540 --> 48:21.580
The best thing to do is to leave him alone.

48:21.820 --> 48:26.260
- Let's get something for your cold.
- I know what I'm talking about.

48:26.500 --> 48:29.260
- We have to talk.
- Talking to you is bad for my image.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.380
- I'm afraid I insist.
- Oh, you insist?

48:31.620 --> 48:36.860
In that case, let's find someplace private.
Step into my orifice.

48:41.220 --> 48:43.860
- Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
- Hey, Riggs.

48:44.100 --> 48:48.020
- Clip any wrong wires lately?
- I haven't done that for a couple of days.

48:48.260 --> 48:50.180
Next time, wait for the bomb squad.

48:50.420 --> 48:51.380
Yeah, it's our job.

48:51.620 --> 48:53.940
I'll remember that.
We saved a cat, though.

48:54.180 --> 48:57.380
Great. I love cats.

48:57.740 --> 48:59.300
Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.

48:59.540 --> 49:03.500
You purposefully withheld information
concerning a case under my investigation.

49:03.740 --> 49:04.860
Damn right, I did.

49:05.100 --> 49:06.940
Careful, she's Internal Affairs.

49:07.180 --> 49:09.860
You had a tip on Travis.
You should have shared it with me.

49:10.100 --> 49:11.180
No, I take that back.

49:11.420 --> 49:13.740
You were required to share it with me.

49:13.980 --> 49:16.300
I was "required" to share it with you?

49:16.540 --> 49:18.380
I don't have to share shit with you.

49:18.620 --> 49:21.780
Schoolyard rules: If you don't scratch
my back, I don't throw you...

49:22.020 --> 49:24.820
- Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!
- Yes, you can!

49:25.060 --> 49:27.180
Why don't you cut out
this classified bullshit!

49:27.420 --> 49:29.340
Right now! It's giving me the shits!

49:29.580 --> 49:32.940
We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.
We're both on the same side, right?

49:33.180 --> 49:34.060
- Right?
- Right!

49:34.300 --> 49:36.740
Good! Why don't we start to act like it?

49:36.980 --> 49:39.100
There are kids out there.
Babies. No brains.

49:39.340 --> 49:40.940
But they got automatic weapons.

49:41.180 --> 49:45.780
- Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...
- I know about Murtaugh.

49:46.580 --> 49:49.420
And I'm sorry, Riggs.

49:49.660 --> 49:52.060
Yeah.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.940
Why don't you let me in on this?
I can help you.

49:58.180 --> 50:01.220
I really want to help you,
if you'll let me. Let me.

50:01.460 --> 50:04.940
What do you say? Have we got a deal?

50:07.300 --> 50:10.060
Wash your hands...

50:11.180 --> 50:14.780
...and meet me in my office.

50:15.820 --> 50:18.700
I'll be right there.

50:18.900 --> 50:20.740
I'll be right there.

50:20.980 --> 50:22.700
MAC-10, 9-mm, semi-automatic...

50:22.940 --> 50:25.860
...converted to automatic
with 36 rounds in the magazine.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.780
"On a sesame seed bun."

50:28.020 --> 50:29.300
Very illegal.

50:29.540 --> 50:31.540
That gun has a history.
Wanna know about it?

50:31.780 --> 50:34.140
Tell me.

50:35.460 --> 50:38.420
"Killed a convenience store clerk
in LA County, July 1990."

50:38.660 --> 50:42.820
"Used in a drive-by shooting
in San Bernardino County, August 1990."

50:43.060 --> 50:47.700
"Confiscated by a truant officer
of the LA School Board, October 1990."

50:47.940 --> 50:50.260
Scheduled for destruction by the LAPD
six weeks ago.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.820
"Scheduled" for destruction.

50:53.060 --> 50:56.220
But it never got there.

50:56.620 --> 50:59.460
Instead, it found its way
into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...

50:59.700 --> 51:01.980
...who fired it on a police officer,
your partner.

51:02.220 --> 51:03.620
I thought it looked familiar.

51:03.860 --> 51:05.660
That gun and 15,000 others like it...

51:05.900 --> 51:09.380
...were stolen from a police storage facility
before they could be destroyed.

51:09.620 --> 51:12.180
They should be paper clips right now,
or license plates.

51:12.420 --> 51:15.780
Anything but a gun. Here we are
busting our asses on the streets...

51:16.020 --> 51:19.900
...getting these weapons out of circulation
and now they're headed back out.

51:20.140 --> 51:24.580
By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto
something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.

51:24.820 --> 51:28.260
That's why Internal Affairs is onto this.
They think this is an inside job.

51:28.500 --> 51:30.540
That's right. They knew police procedures.

51:30.780 --> 51:33.220
They knew where the guns were stored
and how to get in.

51:33.460 --> 51:35.940
They even knew the sorting codes
on the containers...

51:36.180 --> 51:38.980
...because they took the automatics
and left the junk behind.

51:39.220 --> 51:41.300
- It all pointed to a cop.
- Or an ex-cop.

51:41.540 --> 51:42.300
Right.

51:42.540 --> 51:44.980
Travis.

51:45.860 --> 51:48.820
And you let him slip through your fingers.

51:49.060 --> 51:50.740
That's closer than you ever got.

51:50.980 --> 51:52.300
Close, Riggs?

51:52.540 --> 51:56.860
Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window.

51:57.820 --> 51:59.380
Do you want to go for a ride?

51:59.620 --> 52:01.420
Sure, where are we going?

52:01.660 --> 52:04.460
It's a surprise.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.660
Oh, I love surprises.

52:09.900 --> 52:10.820
What is this place?

52:11.060 --> 52:13.540
I accessed Billy Phelps'phone records
on my computer.

52:13.780 --> 52:15.660
He made a dozen calls to this address.

52:15.900 --> 52:18.140
That was nice of you
to steal that information.

52:18.380 --> 52:19.860
- Semantics, Riggs.
- "Semantics"?

52:20.100 --> 52:22.500
I'm always up for some antics.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.500
Let's go on three.

52:24.740 --> 52:25.540
One.

52:25.780 --> 52:27.780
- On three, or three and then go?
- What?

52:28.020 --> 52:31.500
Never mind. One, two, three.

52:32.580 --> 52:35.140
I've got you.

52:47.020 --> 52:49.220
It looks like Billy's grandmother
owns a big dog.

52:49.460 --> 52:51.180
It's not a dog. It's a horse.

52:51.420 --> 52:53.540
I hate dogs, Riggs.

52:53.780 --> 52:54.860
I don't get it.

52:55.100 --> 52:58.420
You don't get what?
It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.

52:58.660 --> 53:02.980
I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window." I don't get it.

53:03.220 --> 53:05.740
Later.

53:09.180 --> 53:10.540
What are you doing?

53:10.780 --> 53:13.700
I can't shoot a dog.
People, okay, but not dogs.

53:13.940 --> 53:16.100
I should try to make friends with him.

53:16.340 --> 53:18.420
"Make friends"?

53:18.660 --> 53:23.580
Now don't run, because he'll only
chase you down and kill you.

53:24.420 --> 53:25.620
Here, boy.

53:25.860 --> 53:28.380
Here, boy.

53:34.180 --> 53:34.900
Shit!

53:35.140 --> 53:37.820
Good boy.

53:44.220 --> 53:46.780
Riggs?

53:50.260 --> 53:53.100
You're crazy.

54:10.900 --> 54:12.300
Want some?

54:12.540 --> 54:15.020
Are you hungry?

54:15.220 --> 54:16.700
You're a hungry boy.

54:16.940 --> 54:20.660
Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.

54:22.020 --> 54:24.100
Here's one. Leave some for me.

54:24.340 --> 54:27.740
Very slowly, as if you're not here,
just walk away.

54:27.980 --> 54:29.060
You want me to go?

54:29.300 --> 54:30.900
Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.

54:31.140 --> 54:32.500
"Guy sort of thing"?

54:32.740 --> 54:35.500
Are you all alone in here?

54:42.820 --> 54:45.380
Stay, stay.

54:45.940 --> 54:49.020
Come on, let's go.

55:07.860 --> 55:08.980
How many is that?

55:09.220 --> 55:12.900
- Fifty-five.
- Fifty-five. All right, we've got eight more.

55:13.140 --> 55:16.540
We'll get these later. Let's go.

55:18.860 --> 55:20.580
Hi, fellas.

55:20.820 --> 55:23.980
What's in all these boxes?

55:32.420 --> 55:38.020
Easy, let's not kill him, yet.
Let's see who he is first, all right?

55:38.500 --> 55:40.140
You have the right to remain silent.

55:40.380 --> 55:42.180
Shut him up!

55:42.420 --> 55:45.820
"Sergeant Martin Riggs."

55:46.620 --> 55:48.180
- Get the truck ready.
- Right.

55:48.420 --> 55:49.980
So, Sergeant Riggs...

55:50.220 --> 55:51.620
...how did you find us?

55:51.860 --> 55:54.180
Freeze! Police!

55:54.420 --> 55:55.860
Another one?

55:56.100 --> 55:57.620
We need a new fucking dog.

55:57.860 --> 55:59.620
Get your hands up, asshole.

55:59.860 --> 56:02.580
Get them up!

56:04.540 --> 56:05.740
A little bit higher.

56:05.980 --> 56:08.020
That's better.

56:08.260 --> 56:11.020
Very good.

56:13.380 --> 56:16.060
Drop it, miss.

56:16.740 --> 56:19.260
Now, look!

57:04.580 --> 57:07.540
Okay, I'm on! No, wait!

57:07.780 --> 57:10.780
Wait, wait!

57:12.500 --> 57:13.740
Sergeant Cole!

57:13.980 --> 57:17.100
Get down!

57:19.300 --> 57:22.820
Get those cases and kill that dog!

57:32.380 --> 57:33.580
Stop!

57:33.820 --> 57:34.420
The dog.

57:34.660 --> 57:37.620
- Where'd you learn to fight?
- Catholic school. Forget the dog!

57:37.860 --> 57:39.620
Here, boy! We're waiting for the dog!

57:39.860 --> 57:40.780
Hold it.

57:41.020 --> 57:42.180
Come on, dog!

57:42.420 --> 57:46.180
Good dog. Good puppy. Go!

57:47.060 --> 57:48.260
Stop!

57:48.500 --> 57:49.260
What?

57:49.500 --> 57:50.980
- It's full of guns.
- Grab one!

57:51.220 --> 57:52.740
- You grab one!
- Chicken.

57:52.980 --> 57:55.340
Step on it.

57:57.980 --> 58:01.740
Get that crate! Come on!

58:05.540 --> 58:09.740
Hatchett, you said not to worry about
the police, but the cops are all over you!

58:09.980 --> 58:12.340
They got my guns.
They'll come after me, next!

58:12.580 --> 58:14.620
As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!

58:14.860 --> 58:17.660
Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.
We have a deal.

58:17.900 --> 58:18.860
Nobody backs out.

58:19.100 --> 58:21.060
You said you had the cops under control.

58:21.300 --> 58:23.300
I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...

58:23.540 --> 58:25.260
... why I should do business with you.

58:25.500 --> 58:26.940
I'll give you a good reason.

58:27.180 --> 58:28.740
Tyrone, this is Travis.

58:28.980 --> 58:32.980
You back out now, and I'll make sure
only your dentist can identify the body.

58:33.220 --> 58:37.100
Is that a good enough reason for you?

58:37.780 --> 58:39.220
But I need ammo.

58:39.460 --> 58:41.340
I'm out of business without ammo.

58:41.580 --> 58:42.860
I need the good stuff.

58:43.100 --> 58:46.340
You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.

58:46.580 --> 58:47.980
"The good stuff." Jesus.

58:48.220 --> 58:51.900
Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.

58:52.180 --> 58:55.580
You look like I feel.

59:06.940 --> 59:08.940
Have you got anything
I can put on my head?

59:09.180 --> 59:10.460
There's a hat in the closet.

59:10.700 --> 59:15.340
You're all heart. Here, I thought
you'd get all tender and maternal.

59:15.580 --> 59:17.340
I was raised with four brothers.

59:17.580 --> 59:21.900
We got hurt often, but if no bones were
broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.

59:22.140 --> 59:23.380
Look, blood. See? Blood.

59:23.620 --> 59:24.940
It's not gushing.

59:25.180 --> 59:27.500
It was free flowing earlier.

59:27.740 --> 59:33.740
Could you bring me a needle and thread?
Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.

59:35.020 --> 59:36.380
Don't touch anything.

59:36.620 --> 59:39.380
I wasn't.

59:39.580 --> 59:42.660
What's with you?

59:57.340 --> 59:58.780
What are you doing?

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.460
- I said not to touch anything.
- It came on by itself.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.580
All by itself? What are you, a wise guy?

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.660
You don't like to share your toys, do you?

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.580
- This isn't a toy.
- What is it?

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.500
- This is a weapon.
- A weapon?

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.820
Used properly, a very effective weapon.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.820
What, do you throw it at people?

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.620
You'll give yourself a hernia.
Come here. Sit down.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.820
Right here.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:22.180
- Take a little off the top...
- Right here.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.940
Do you bring all your interrogations home?

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.380
- What are we talking about?
- It's back here.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.180
- Careful, careful.
- Turn your head.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.660
- Careful.
- This?

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.300
- This scratch?
- It feels like the Grand Canyon.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.140
Oh, God.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.500
Hold still.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.740
Oh, God. We haven't even started.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.660
Be gentle with me.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.180
I see this isn't virgin territory.
What is this? A knife?

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.220
That's an ax.
Some guy mistook my head for a log.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.980
- That's a natural mistake.
- What, I have a wooden head?

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.500
- Look at that.
- A knife.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.460
Knife? That's very nice.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.700
This is all right.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.220
That's a pavement,
dragged down Crenshaw.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.260
That's great. Look at that texture.
Look at this.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.380
Same thing. Third and Highland.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.180
- Dragged for about half a block.
- That's a good one.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.460
Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.500
- Moving truck.
- Moving truck?

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.540
Moving bullet.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.700
- Moving bullet?
- Here. This is the best.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.540
- It goes all the way through to the back.
- Right through?

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.260
You're lucky. Was it a.22?

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.860
It's a.38.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.740
- It's a.38.
- That? That's wimpy. This is a.38.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.660
Yours is bigger than mine?
I don't think so.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.060
Maybe not, but look.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.060
A whole family of.44s on the back.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.140
There they are.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.420
That's impressive.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.780
One hit my lung. I was breathing
blood bubbles. It was disgusting.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.140
Blood bubbles. Okay.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.140
You got one?

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:47.500
Pump-action. 12-gauge.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.340
Right down here. Went through.

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.940
- That must have hurt.
- Right.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:52.980
Not too close.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.300
Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.780
I can beat it.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.300
- I'll take your word for it.
- You gotta see this.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.300
- I believe you.
- This guy had a knife.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.460
You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg
and ran it around eight times.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.620
- I'll take your word for it.
- Look!

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.100
No, I said forget it.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.700
This is a blue-ribbon event.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.740
Forget it.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.060
You started this.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.740
- Yeah, I can end it.
- You know what?

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.780
You're a very poor loser.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.820
I didn't lose.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.180
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't lose.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.580
- You lost.
- I conceded.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.060
There's a difference between losing
and conceding.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.020
You conceded or you're conceited?

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.860
- You think I'm conceited?
- Yeah.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.900
Tell me you lost. Admit to it.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.300
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.580
- Tell me you lost.
- I said don't touch anything...

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.780
You're going to smack
the shit out of me, right?

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.300
I can do better than that.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.180
This could be a serious ethical breach here.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.620
I never made it
with another sergeant before.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.500
Shut up, Riggs.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.700
I'm as hungry as a whale.
Bring on the food.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.940
He's got a sense of humor.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.500
Watch this. This is a good bit.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.900
I think you're gonna get on just fine.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:18.020
If you could pry yourself away
from doggie heaven, I'm finished out here.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:22.700
- You wanna take a look?
- Sure. Let's go outside for some air.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.060
One for you.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.580
One for you. No favorites.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.940
I just have to finish the flashing here...

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.580
...and the roofing shingles
about another few bundles.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.900
Unless it rains, it should hold up all right.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.740
That's comforting.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.180
I like a man who takes pride in his work.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.060
Do you know where I can find one?

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.340
Like trying to find a cop
when you need one.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.940
We're not mind readers.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.860
You have to have a mind to read.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.060
Read it and weep.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.700
With these prices
you're promoting graft in the port.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.980
If there's anybody
who knows about graft, it's you.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.940
- Hi, Martin.
- How are you doing?

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.460
- Hi, Mickey.
- Hi, Rianne.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.860
What are you doing here?

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.380
Or shouldn't I ask?

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.460
You got a sink to unplug?

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.260
- I got your sink.
- Good. Go do it.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.300
I'll see you next week.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.340
What's up?

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.300
Dad didn't come home last night.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.500
He always comes home.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.900
Oh, damn, Riggs.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.820
What do you want?

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.060
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.100
Who sent you? Trish?

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.500
You're doing pretty well.
Trish didn't send me.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.060
Rianne came to see me.
She asked me to find you.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.180
To your place?

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.580
Well, that's where I am.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:15.500
- My daughter came to your trailer?
- Yeah.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:19.820
- My daughter came to your trailer?
- Come on, she was worried.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.700
Get off of my boat, Riggs!

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.620
- Come on.
- Get off my boat!

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.180
You're drunk.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.420
That's something you should know about.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.140
- This isn't going to do you any good.
- Give me that.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.260
Give me that.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.180
Roger, please don't do this.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.380
You got three days until you retire.
This won't do you any good.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.100
You self-righteous bastard! Give it...

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.980
Don't do this, okay? Please?

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.420
Give it to me, damn it.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.020
What are you going to do now, shoot me?

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.020
There.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.700
Take your finger out of my bottle.
Give me that gun.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.100
The bottle's going sailing.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.300
Son of a bitch!

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.380
Not bad for an old man.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.660
Are you finished?

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.460
No, I got another bottle in the galley
and I'll get it.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.660
No, you're not.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.780
Don't do this to yourself.

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.620
You gotta cut this out.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.180
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.460
Come on. Sit down.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.380
- You hit me.
- Cool it, will you?

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.300
Cut it out. Give it up, okay?

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:21.500
Go ahead.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.420
Go ahead. Hit me again.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:26.020
I don't want to hit you.
You think I like this shit?

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.700
Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you...

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.260
- I know you're not.
...and that kung-fu shit?

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.580
Please, Rog.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.020
That kid was a killer, all right.
That wasn't a toy in his hand.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.580
That was a machine pistol
with twin carbines and all the trimmings.

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.140
He would have drilled you, me,
anybody that came along.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.820
You had no choice.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.140
It didn't happen to you. It happened to me.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.660
It happened to me!

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.900
My God, I killed that kid!

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.340
I killed that boy.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.340
You've killed a lot of people.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.780
You've killed a fucking lot of people!
You don't kill a baby.

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.020
You've got ice in your veins.
You don't kill a boy like Nick.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.660
You selfish bastard!

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.500
You selfish bastard!

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.900
You're just thinking about yourself.

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.820
What about me?

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.860
We're partners. We are partners.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.700
What happens to you, happens to me.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.979
After all the shit we've been through,
don't you get it?

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.220
Don't you get it?

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:23.620
When you retire, you're not just
retiring you, you're retiring us.

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:25.899
- You're retiring us.
- That's not my problem.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:26.859
Yes, it is.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.620
- It's not my problem.
- You're the only family I've got.

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.660
I've got three beautiful kids.
I love them and they're yours.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:35.899
Trish does my laundry.
I live in your icebox. I live in your life!

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.500
What am I going to do?

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.100
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do.

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.620
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do.

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:41.859
I don't care!

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.020
Yes, you do!

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.020
- I don't care.
- You do so.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.140
I don't care!

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:55.819
I don't know what I'm saying anymore.
I don't know what I'm thinking.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.660
I had three days, and now this.

01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:00.859
I'm sorry.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.899
- That's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.460
I didn't realize that my retirement
was gonna screw you up.

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:13.060
Forget it. I haven't got any problems.
I was out of line saying that shit.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.420
Look, man...

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.380
Riggs, look...

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.380
You know I love you.

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:25.660
You know I love you, Riggs.
And your problems are my problems.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:28.540
Like you said, "What happens to you...

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:30.859
...happens to me." So try me.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.819
I'm here for you.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.540
I haven't got any problems.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:39.620
Yes, you do. We all have problems.
You help me...

01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:42.939
...and I'm gonna help you.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.740
I do have a little problem.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.220
You don't want to hear it.
This is piddly shit.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.100
Yes, I do. I want to hear it.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.180
- Tell me.
- This is ridiculous.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.180
- You don't want to hear it.
- No. I'm here.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.180
Well...

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:04.700
I think maybe I slept with someone
that I probably shouldn't have.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.980
You son of a bitch!

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:14.340
Help me.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.700
I ought to let you drown, you traitor.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.940
Help me.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.140
Come on in.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.820
What did you hit me for?

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:28.100
'Cause you slept with Rianne.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.140
I did not.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.620
- Who did you sleep with?
- I slept with Sergeant Cole.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.300
Sergeant Cole from Traffic?

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.420
No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.460
Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic
is her uncle.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:43.660
- Okay. That's okay.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:45.980
Sheriff's Department.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.020
Sheriff...

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.580
We're LAPD.

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.220
What are you boys doing down there?

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.780
- We're in the middle of a case.
- Yeah.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.580
Of Scotch.

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.340
Let's get out of here.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.580
Go with the grain.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.460
I'll show you. Here.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.700
You're going against the grain.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:32.540
- Like that.
- Okay.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.460
Are you okay?

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.580
Darryl was my friend, Dad.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.820
I know. I'm sorry, son.

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:52.060
I hope you don't blame me.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.620
I don't blame you, Dad.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.740
I blame Darryl.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:03.340
What's this right here?

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.860
I love you, Dad.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.500
I love you, son.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.100
"May he find the peace in Heaven
that eluded him on Earth."

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.940
"And may the scourge of violence...

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.500
...claiming the lives of our children
be lifted by Your grace...

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.940
...and infinite wisdom."

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.740
"Amen."

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.820
Wait here.

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.380
Mrs. Smithers...

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.140
Ma'am?

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.020
I just don't know...

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.140
You want to do something,
Sergeant Murtaugh?

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.660
You find the man...

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.500
...that put the gun in my son's hand.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.780
Take your mama to the car.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.700
Are you okay?

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.460
Yeah.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.500
Who's got the gun?

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.980
- You got it.
- Yeah.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.500
- Where did this gun come from?
- Fuck you!

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.940
Ever heard of the word "genocide"?
Have you, stupid motherfucker?

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.740
Have you ever heard of genocide?

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.380
You fools are killing yourselves!
You're killing us!

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.340
I'm tired of it!

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.780
You'd better tell me where this
comes from or I'll blow your head off.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.700
I want to know, now!
Where did it come from?

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:49.700
Do you see this gun? I want to know
where it came from. Now!

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:51.060
I want a name!

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:54.100
Do you see that car?
I want a name, asshole!

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.420
I want a name! I want a name now!

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.220
One!

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.620
Are you crazy?

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.980
Ready?

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:04.780
Watch your hands.
That tire will rip them right off.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.700
- Two!
- I'm getting excited.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.700
Very excited.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.940
- Your face is going to be a skidmark!
- No!

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.740
It's Jack Travis!

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.340
That's what I wanted, baby.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.740
Three!

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.940
Wrong...

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.700
Women drivers, baby.

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.460
We're looking for your friend, Travis.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.740
I've never heard of him.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.300
Wrong answer.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.340
You're pulling on the wrong string.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.260
That's not a very professional attitude.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.620
Who the fuck are you guys?

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860
Sorry, LAPD.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:49.140
We're doing a few routine inquiries.
Have you been checked for lumps recently?

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.660
Give me my fucking wallet!

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.180
Keep your hands down!

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.540
My fucking wallet!

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.900
Get up! We don't need this.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:01.140
We have a license that belongs to Hubert
Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.100
Fuck you!

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.420
Hey, there's a lady here.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.140
What the hell's going on here?

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.420
- Maybe they know something.
- I'll go find out.

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.500
- Want me to come with you?
- No, I got it.

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.420
Maybe I should go with her.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.740
No, I want you to see something.
She has a gift. Watch this.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.940
Good morning, gentlemen. LAPD.

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.380
I've got a few questions.

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.780
Are you on parole?

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.460
- I got a job...
- Who asked you?

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.420
Do any of you know a Mr. Travis?

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.860
You got a warrant?

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.500
No, but I can get one.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.780
Until you do...

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.260
...fuck off.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.580
That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.100
Fuck you.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:43.140
I don't think so.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.660
Backspin kick.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.620
Are you okay, honey?

01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.380
Just great.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.860
- "Honey"?
- How are you doing?

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.580
This guy's on parole.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.500
This guy's an asshole!

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:13.420
- Riggs, there's five of them.
- I know.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.820
Look at that.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:26.220
Grabbed his clusters!

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.580
Let me help her.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.340
Stay still.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.060
My girl.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:49.300
This PMS is murder.

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.580
I know what you mean.

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:53.220
I've been married 25 years.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.220
So, tell me about Travis.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.140
I told you before, moron,
I don't know Jack Travis.

01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.980
I didn't say his name was Jack.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:03.780
You better start telling me
more than jackshit.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.980
- Men cross the street when they see me.
- I didn't have enough time.

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:12.740
I'm not your enemy, Captain.
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.700
- Have you eaten?
- I already ate. I've gotta go downtown.

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.900
- What, do you eat alone?
- I'm used to it.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.500
It's bad for the digestion.

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:23.940
Tomorrow, you'll have lunch with me,
but I'm not paying.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.900
Are you all right?

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.780
Two fingers, Murph.

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.900
- Jack, what the fuck?
- Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.340
After watching Lorna
handle herself so well...

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.700
...I'm changing my mind about kung fu.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.620
Want to try it sometime?

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.420
- No.
- Come on.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.940
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.140
"Old dog", my ass.

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.580
Let's try something. Watch this.
It's called a backspin kick.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.780
Pivot on the right, kick with your left...

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.860
...and you whip that head around
to catch the target over there.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.460
Like this. Get that head around
and follow through.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.540
Like so.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.180
So you whip the head.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.780
All right?

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.740
Thank you. Now you try it.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:18.740
Here's your target. All right?

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.900
Remember, pivot right, kick left,
get that head around, spot that target.

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:25.340
- Like that.
- Yeah. Follow the head around.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:28.220
Back up a bit. We don't want you
to bump into the pole.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.100
Just back up a little bit.
A little bit more. Okay, good.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.140
Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.820
Okay.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.300
Go.

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:44.580
He can't hold his water.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.500
Get back to work!

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.580
Okay, back to work, everybody.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:52.740
Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:55.900
Sergeant Murtaugh,
you could be experiencing...

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.580
...some transitional anger
caused by the shooting.

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.180
Do you want to talk about it?

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.020
- He's okay for a change.
- Are you sure?

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.500
You look good in red. That's your color.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:13.540
- I've got a little extra time now.
- I'm fine, Doctor.

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.420
Oh, shit!

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.420
Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:21.460
What?

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.060
It's her.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:27.220
Can you tell me where I can find
the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.900
Hi, skinny!

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.180
- Delores. Remember me?
- I remember you.

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.260
Can you tell me where I can find
the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:39.460
Actually, he's cowering down
on all fours right behind this counter.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.580
- Where is the sergeant?
- He's not here right now.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.980
But he's talked of nothing but you all week.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.140
Shut my mouth.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.580
The man's on fire.

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:50.900
- What's the matter, baby?
- A little sciatica.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.540
You tell him Delores was here.

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.340
You tell that man...

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.460
...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.540
I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.180
See you.

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:07.100
Delores says
you're "the jam in her jellyroll".

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.900
I heard.

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.820
That's a lot of woman.

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.340
She calls me all the time.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.660
She leaves me notes.
What am I going to do?

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.420
You shouldn't have led her on.

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.460
Led her on? I didn't do anything.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.940
Sergeant, we have got to talk.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.700
You've got to come see me.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:30.260
We've got to work. Come on. Let's go.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.900
- Thanks anyway, for your concern.
- Thanks, Doc. You're a beauty.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.260
- Coming?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:46.700
Good afternoon, Captain.

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.020
That's good. See how easy that was?

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.540
I love it down here. Don't you?

01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:00.660
This place is better than the swap meet.
Best bargains in town.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.540
Give me the lock-up keys.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.260
Those guys from the garage,
they're all ex-cons.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.540
They were all busted by the same
police officer, Jack Edward Travis.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:14.940
Early paroles
on the work-furlough program.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.180
Employed by a company called
Mesa Verde Construction.

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.900
You can't go in there.
You don't have a pass.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.780
- May I see your pass?
- My pass?

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:23.900
Here's my fucking pass.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.660
- I got shot in the line of duty.
- He's with us.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.220
- "He's with us"?
- I said that?

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:29.700
Where'd you get her from?

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.420
Why aren't you in the hospital?

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.020
Don't mention it.
I told you not to leave me there.

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.980
They tried to take my appendix out.
They gave me a lapotomy.

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.780
- Brain surgery?
- A lapotomy.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.060
Not a lobotomy.
Cut your hair so you can hear.

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.660
What's the difference?

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:46.140
The difference is, for a lapotomy,
they shave your nether regions.

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.660
Nether what?

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.060
Nether... I can't say it in front of her.

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.180
Point to it.

01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.580
- Here.
- It must be itchy.

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.220
It is itchy. These doctors are savages.

01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:01.100
Where does it say that a gunshot wound
requires a rectal exam?

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.540
Yeah. With a telescope big enough
to see Venus.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.500
I guess all they saw was Uranus.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.700
That's great. Thank you.

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.180
You know what I say?

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.820
They fuck you in the hospital.
First they drug you, then they fuck you!

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.260
When they're done...

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.420
...the insurance company comes
and fucks you some more!

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.660
$10 for a fucking aspirin
and it isn't even covered!

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.860
That's enough!

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.380
We're trying to work here.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.420
So, what's new on our case?
Anything new? You got Travis yet?

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:28.940
Did you guys advertise?

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.580
- He's family.
- Who's she?

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.740
- Sergeant Cole.
- How are you? Leo Getz.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.260
- Anything you need, Leo "gets". Get it?
- I get it.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.660
It's real estate now...

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:40.140
Listen, come on, you guys,
give me a break.

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.380
I owe this guy one.
Give me something to do.

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.060
You can get us a cup of coffee.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.740
That's great. I take one for you
and that's what you tell me?

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.660
- He could check this out.
- That's all I'm good for?

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.460
We've got something for you to do.

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:57.340
Check out Mesa Verde Construction.
Find out all the information you can.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.940
- Sure, I can do this.
- Can you remember that name?

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.660
Mesa Verde, I got it.

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:05.660
- Wait. What are you doing?
- If there's any shit there, he'll find it.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.220
- Who is that guy?
- It's a long story.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.020
Here are your keys, Captain.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.220
You motherfucker!

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.220
- Don't be stupid.
- What the fuck?

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:23.660
Take the elevator, get the other guys.
Keys. Give me those fucking hands.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.660
Goddamn you, Travis. What the fuck?

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:31.060
Stand there.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.820
I can get faster results
than that real estate broker.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.300
Leo's not just a real estate broker.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:42.100
He's a pain in the ass
with a lot of connections.

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:45.660
This is what we came for.
Load everything on the elevator.

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:48.260
- How'd you know where to find them?
- We got it all.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.980
The world of computers.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.020
You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:56.260
You know what future a cop has? None.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.340
Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.060
Pension.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.180
Nothing to do.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.620
Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain
by evening. Not for this kid.

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.820
Police Department's got it all:

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.500
Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.020
It's a one-stop shopping center
if you've got the balls and the brains.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.900
Not a thing anybody can do about it.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.220
You're already fucking history
and you know it.

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:19.660
Sorry. I'm just getting started.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.740
Something's wrong.

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.460
The program's been accessed
by someone from the outside.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.020
What's been accessed?

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:29.860
After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs
moved the confiscated ammunition.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.300
Armor-piercing bullets?

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.340
Thousands of rounds
to a more secure location.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.900
- That's what's been accessed.
- Someone else knows.

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.900
Where's this store? Where'd they move it?

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.500
Let's go.

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.220
- I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.
- That's a switch.

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.180
- Right here in the building.
- Where?

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.260
- I'm showing you.
- Something's going down.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500
- Nothing's going down.
- I'm going with you.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.900
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two today.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:53.980
Come on.

01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.580
Have you got protection?

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.340
- Right here in my wallet.
- No, your vest, you dummy.

01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.860
Should we take him?

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.860
- Okay, but keep your head down.
- Stay behind me.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.340
Come on, let's go. Quiet!

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.820
You were my ticket in.

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.900
It's too bad you won't be coming with me.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:29.100
They got it all.

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.540
- He's dead.
- How'd they get it out of here?

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:33.780
- I don't know.
- Not upstairs.

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.820
Elevator.

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.540
Shit. It's down.

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:40.940
The subway's down there.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:43.100
- Let's take the stairs.
- LA has subways?

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.660
- Where've you been?
- Read something besides the comics.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.420
All right. Come on, let's hustle!

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.380
Hurry up, guys.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.780
LAPD! Come here!

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.260
Come here! Step on it!

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.700
Son of a bitch!

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.940
Did you see anybody or anything strange?

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:17.660
- Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.
- Split now. Just get out of here.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.020
- I'm going across.
- I got it.

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:29.460
Get rid of Murphy, now!

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:37.620
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Let's go.

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.340
Let's get out of here.

01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.940
Cover me.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.740
Let's go.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:25.100
Stay still.

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.220
Happy birthday, kid.

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.740
Another baby.

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.140
Is he dead? Check the body.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.180
Get me out of here!

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.940
Stupid son of a bitch!

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:34.980
Stop that.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.060
Cut it out.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.860
- Don't shoot.
- LAPD!

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.220
Where does this lead?

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.780
- Pico Station.
- Thanks.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:41.980
Not that way.

01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:45.740
Take the stairs, it's faster.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.020
Gangway!

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.300
Get out of the way!

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.060
Holy shit!

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.820
Son of a bitch!

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:16.660
Police!

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.140
Step on it. There he is.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.020
Goddamn!

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.900
Put your foot down!

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.380
Police!

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:01.580
I need your bike.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.220
This is bullshit.

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:08.140
Sergeant Riggs, call it in.
I need a couple of clips, too.

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:24.620
Okay, we lost him.

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:32.380
Where's Riggs?

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:36.660
Keep me in touch
with the motorcycle pursuit.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:43.380
- Shit!
- Take a right, now.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.380
Take a right.

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.900
Go!

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.420
Take a right! No, left!

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.500
This is 6-William-6.
I'm at the freeway construction site.

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.620
Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.140
Come back to me, Central.

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.340
Where the hell is Riggs?

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:42.780
Take a left here! Get off!

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.900
Get off the freeway!

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.380
Stop! Hold it!

01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:00.060
Shit!

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:02.700
Hang on!

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:19.100
Where is the pursuit?

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.820
Shit!

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.740
Relax, Riggs.

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.580
Relax?

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.860
Shit!

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.900
Just get back. Get back!

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.460
Riggs, talk to me.

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:06.140
Riggs, you're alive.

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.780
Don't move.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.860
Just get back.

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.820
Are you all right?

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.300
Don't touch me!

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:22.780
Okay! I'm not touching you!

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.220
Don't touch me!

01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:33.420
- Don't touch me.
- I won't touch you.

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.260
- Are you okay now?
- I'm pissed. Now I'm pissed.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.700
- Now what?
- That bastard!

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.940
He's done this twice now. Damn!

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:45.940
Son of a gun,
I'll suck his eyes down through his nose.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:49.340
That's twice he's got away.
Nobody gets away from me.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.140
Just relax.

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.060
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:56.660
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.540
- I'm having that.
- You quit!

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.980
I ran out of biscuits, okay?
Give me a break.

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:10.540
Oh, shit!

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:15.820
Perfect.

01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:17.660
What'd I miss?

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.980
- What are you doing here?
- Great car chase.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.100
- Great chase.
- What are you doing here?

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:24.060
- How'd you find us?
- Police scanner.

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.100
What are you doing with a police scanner?

01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.660
Hello, Car 54, where are you?
I cracked this case for you guys.

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:32.540
Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.020
They got a housing project,
called Rancho Arroyo.

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.540
- I know where that is.
- Why don't we check it out?

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.340
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah, okay.

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.660
I'll come with you.

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.660
- You're not coming with us.
- Yes, I am.

01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:43.900
I'll take my car.

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.780
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:51.060
I can't believe you did that! I got a spare!

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.220
- You're driving.
- No, I'm driving.

01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:58.580
How could you do that?
I can't believe you did that.

01:35:58.820 --> 01:35:59.940
Where's Lorna?

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:03.540
I can't believe you did that!

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.340
I can't believe it.

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:08.380
How could you do that to me?

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:09.660
Did you see that?

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:13.180
They're my partners.
I can't believe they did that!

01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:16.380
Do you own your own home?

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:49.700
- Looks like we came to the right place.
- Yeah.

01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.780
Move on out to Travis Town.

01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.300
Great place to raise a family.

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.540
Built on guns and bloodshed.

01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.060
One hell of a retirement plan
this asshole's got.

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.140
Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:04.460
- Say, is that...
- Darryl's gun.

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:07.220
- I've been saving it for the right occasion.
- This is it.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.660
- How many men do you think he has?
- Who knows?

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.780
Maybe I should run over there
and ask him?

01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:13.180
That'd be too easy.

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.780
Wish I had some grenades
or a rocket launcher.

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:18.180
Maybe a ground-to-air missile.

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.260
I wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:25.340
It's obvious Murphy
was never a Boy Scout.

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:28.980
Not even a good spare.

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.220
Put your hands down...

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.420
...it's embarrassing.

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:36.900
How are you doing?

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:37.940
Kissing.

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.380
Fresh ones?

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.220
Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:42.780
No points for those.

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.580
- How'd you get here?
- Drove.

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:48.940
I ran into Leo at the police station.
He talked to me first.

01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.260
- Any ideas?
- Lucky thing we've got a plan.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.860
Lucky thing. What is it?

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.300
I want it to be a surprise.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:58.540
I like surprises.

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.100
Move it!

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.140
- Check it out.
- Let's go.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:27.500
- Look what they did to Murph's car.
- It could've been worse.

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.940
- It could've been yours.
- Worse, it could've been Trish's car.

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.340
- On three.
- Three.

01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.620
Three?

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.820
One...

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.020
...two...
- Three!

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:40.780
Police! Freeze!

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:43.660
Oh, shit!

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:55.340
- Let's go!
- Right now!

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.900
What's wrong with you?
I said go on three, not two.

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:05.260
On three.

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.620
It's always three.

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.420
Boys!

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:12.940
What are we doing here?
Losing our heads in a crisis?

01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:17.420
Cover me!

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.300
Exxon.

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:41.820
- What?
- Count to 20.

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:42.580
What?

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:46.380
Count to 20 and then light me.

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.660
Shit!

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:56.140
Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:10.980
- Cover me.
- Cover you?

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.580
Cover you, cover Riggs.

01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:16.620
When's someone gonna cover me
for a change?

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.940
What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it.

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.020
It's the cops. They're burning everything.

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:52.500
Son of a bitch!

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.780
Crazy motherfucker!

01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.220
Damn!

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:03.020
Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.220
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:21.900
Yeah!

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.500
Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.260
Stay there.

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.380
Shit, where's Riggs?

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.580
Son of a bitch! No clip.

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.260
Lorna, no, don't!

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.100
Come on in, bitch.

01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.900
The door's open!

01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:39.980
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.700
Son of a bitch.

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.620
Shit!

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.540
Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.

01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:30.060
Cop killers.

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:33.420
You're coming with me!

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:42.900
Fuck you, asshole!

01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.340
Get up!

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.740
Get up!

01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:06.940
Killed in the line of duty.

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:13.220
You'll get a great funeral
from the Department.

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:20.580
Cop killers.

01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:33.500
Ex-cop killers.

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.740
Go to hell, Riggs.

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:47.620
You first.

01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:59.220
Crazy son of a bitch!

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:07.300
Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:09.780
Just hold still.

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:12.140
Get a chopper, man.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.460
She had two vests on.
She's gonna be okay.

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:16.820
A couple of bad ones.
We need to get a chopper.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.860
You're all right, partner. Hang on.

01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.900
It's okay. Just lie still.

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:27.220
Just a romantic evening by the fire,
just the two of us.

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:30.060
Just be still.

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:41.020
Honey, open your eyes.

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:43.980
Open your eyes.

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:48.220
What are you trying to prove out there?

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:50.140
Why do you do that?

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:53.580
- Can I take this off?
- Yeah.

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:59.340
You're supposed to grow old
with someone, not because of them.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.340
I'm gonna be with you.

01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:07.620
I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.

01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:11.300
We're both here, right? Right.

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.220
Come on, I want to be with you.

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.020
What have you got to lose?

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:18.660
You.

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:21.900
Not likely.

01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.540
- Hey, Lorna.
- Yeah?

01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:33.380
Let's live to regret this.

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.980
- We've got to go, sir.
- Okay.

01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:41.100
She's gonna be fine.

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.980
Can you hear me?

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.780
I love you.

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:08.500
"Happy retirement, Daddy"

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:12.700
"Happy retirement, Daddy"

01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.580
This is it. This is the day.

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.780
Everybody? Daddy?

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:19.860
I want you to know there's a candle
for every year in the Force.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.100
Yes! A lot of years.

01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:26.020
- You have to blow it out.
- Come on.

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:27.580
I can't.

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.460
- Come on, blow it out.
- That's not what I mean.

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:32.100
What?

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.060
I can't retire.

01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:38.460
I thought I could. I wanted to.

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.260
But I can't.

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:46.260
That means you're gonna
stay with the Force?

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:50.340
That means I'm staying
with the Force, baby.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:55.900
This cake's about to explode,
so you'd better blow out these candles.

01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:59.380
I want you to know
that I'm behind you all the way.

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.220
- Me, too.
- So am I, Dad.

01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.340
It's okay.

01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:07.380
Well, the streets will be safer
for another couple of years.

01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:08.980
"Word", Nick?

01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:11.820
"Word", Dad.

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.420
Blow them out!

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:16.700
Hello?

01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:19.060
Hello! In here!

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:22.540
Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.900
Oprah should see this.

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:26.260
I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.900
What is it?

01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:31.580
Where's Riggs? I didn't know
he could hold his breath that long.

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.300
I'm taking a bath, Leo.

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:37.540
I can see that. And it's cold water, too.
There goes your image.

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.260
Listen, I got great news.

01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:42.180
Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.

01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.860
Okay, I have sold this turkey.

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:49.260
This termite-infested dump is now gone.
Okay?

01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:53.220
All you have to do is sign the contract
before the suckers change their mind.

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.500
Okay? I did it!

01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.140
The house is off the market.

01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:00.940
We're gonna stay in this "termite-infested turkey"
for another ten years.

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:04.060
- At least.
- Maybe I'll get married here.

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.060
- Come on, out.
- You can't do this.

01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.860
- Out.
- No, you can't do that.

01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.660
You can't do that. I have contracts signed.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.060
Because we're partners,
no commission. Okay?

01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:14.980
Partners?

01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:17.300
You and Riggs owe me two new tires.

01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:18.300
Why?

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.540
Because bullets aren't covered
in normal road hazard. That's why!

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.700
I want those tires. No conditions.

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.220
Leo, get out of here!

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:27.420
- Don't tell me to get out!
- Out!

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:31.860
Okay, I'm going.
You're lucky your wife's here.

01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:35.460
Don't come crying to me if...

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.380
Get out!

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:40.740
- Termites get...
- No more!

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:44.420
Your friends.

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:48.580
Ten more years till forced retirement.

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:52.700
That's 3,650 days.

01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:56.220
- Forty-nine.
- Oh, yeah.

01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:09.300
I gotta improve my image.

01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:21.700
'Bye, Daddy!

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:25.420
'Bye, baby.

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:34.900
What are you smiling at?

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.660
Why weren't you at my party?

01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.460
I knew you weren't going to retire.

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.340
I've been wrong about a few things
in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.

01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.380
Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:47.060
I'm smoking to forget
my dog-biscuit problem.

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:48.900
What dog-biscuit problem?

01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.900
I've been chasing more cars lately...

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:54.260
...and when I try to lick my balls,
I keep falling off the couch.

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:55.620
Jesus Christ.

01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:57.260
I'm driving. Other side.

01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:00.380
I've got no dispute. I just came over
to open the door for you.

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.820
Thank you for opening it.

01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:04.540
An old fella like you
needs all the help he can get.

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:05.820
I'll show you.

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.820
- Who's a grumpy bastard?
- I'm a grumpy bastard.

01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.340
- You know something?
- What?

01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:14.220
When I do retire,
I hope your next partner is just like you.

01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:18.100
There's winners and there's losers,
and God wouldn't do that to me.

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.140
He did it to me.

01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:22.420
I know.

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:25.460
See what I mean?

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.180
My point exactly.

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:30.300
Son of a bitch!

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.580
Stay away from my daughter!

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.060
You can't be serious?
What are you talking about?

01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:37.580
I saw you kiss Rianne.

01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.860
She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.

01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:42.900
- That's not the point!
- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.

01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.580
If it's just friendship,
try shaking hands next time.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:49.100
- Are you getting enough fiber in your diet?
- I'm getting enough fiber!

01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:50.420
I'm spoken for, okay?

01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.380
I'm gonna pick Lorna up
from the hospital this afternoon.

01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:54.820
We're practically...

01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.340
- You're serious?
- We've got a dog and everything.

01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:59.780
I figure I can make ends meet.

01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:04.940
English subtitles conformed by
SOFTITLER

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.100
All units! All units! Code 2, High.

01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.820
Don't even think about it. Don't even try.

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.980
This is us, rolling to Code 2, High,
at Verrina Place.

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.820
Shit. This time
we wait for the bomb squad.

01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:23.900
Do you think I want to end up
in uniform again?

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:21.500
20-William-12,
the REA Bomb Squad's en route. All units.

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:24.140
Those guys gonna get in the way again?

01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.300
There it is. Happy? Let's go.

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:28.380
We ain't seen nothing yet, Rog.

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.780
- Get me closer.
- It's roped off.

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:34.300
- Can't see the bomb squad anywhere.
- They're coming.

01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.660
Stop here and I'll just get out.

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:39.260
No, don't get out of the car, Riggs!

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.660
Tell me, was it the red wire or blue...

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.900
- Let's get out of here.
- Step on the gas.

01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:45.380
They'll never believe this!

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:48.100
- I hope nobody saw us.
- They'll blame us.

01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:51.420
Let's keep cool. You'd better
get your girdle out of mothballs.

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.820
They'll say, "Back in uniform again."

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.180
Ten more years of this!

01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:00.900
I'm too old for this shit.
