00:01.334 --> 00:02.968
Ryan: I thought
you were dead.

00:02.969 --> 00:04.136
If something happened
to you, that would end me.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.704
            Now you know
            how I feel.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.339
                So you have
                a plan?

00:07.341 --> 00:08.841
I have an epic plan.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.175
I need you, em.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.343
        Ryan: I want to
        make a trade--

00:11.345 --> 00:12.711
        Your son
        for joe carroll.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.279
I sacrificed
too much, joe.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.948
            I'm not willing to
            give up on you.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.717
        Can't have you running
        off after ryan hardy.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.119
        Give me my son.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.353
            Now!

00:21.355 --> 00:23.355
            Mark: Where's luke?

00:24.557 --> 00:25.791
        [gunshots]

00:25.793 --> 00:26.592
            No!

00:26.594 --> 00:28.627
It's too late! Drive!

00:31.664 --> 00:32.598
            Max: Mike, stop it!

00:32.600 --> 00:34.199
Ryan: What's going
on with you?

00:34.201 --> 00:35.901
            I have joe. Where's
            the airstrip?

00:35.903 --> 00:37.069
    Mark: Tillman road.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.937
    We'll meet you there
    in 20 minutes.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.105
            What?

00:41.708 --> 00:42.775
Ryan: Where is he?

00:42.777 --> 00:43.609
            I don't know!

00:43.611 --> 00:45.444
    Ryan: Joe was here.
    Someone inside the fbi

00:45.446 --> 00:46.111
        Is helping him.

00:46.113 --> 00:47.646
            You made me give up
            the fbi.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.280
Please, jana.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.115
            I'm here for you
            when you need
            anything.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.551
You've been
so good to me.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.385
    They killed my son.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.055
Carroll: You are getting
exactly what you deserved.

00:56.057 --> 00:56.822
            Aah!

00:56.824 --> 00:59.124
I'm done
with you, lily.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.793
Good-bye.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.110
We're here.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.255
            Should we call
            somebody,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.191
            Let them know
            we're here?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.293
Oh. They know
we're here.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.528
            Creepy. How well
            do you know

01:36.530 --> 01:37.429
This robert guy?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.831
            He already
            told you that.

01:38.833 --> 01:39.765
Am I talking to you?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.300
        Hey, hey, girls.
        We're all tired.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.534
    Let's not fight, huh?

01:42.536 --> 01:47.506
        And he lives here
        with his friends.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.212
So...

01:53.214 --> 01:56.281
What is the plan
once we get inside?

01:56.283 --> 01:59.651
        Meet our host,
        figure out
        the hierarchy,

01:59.653 --> 02:01.353
        Feel our way, you know?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.821
What kind of cult
is this?

02:02.823 --> 02:05.624
    I hear they're
    quite a peaceful lot.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.161
    Roderick identified them
    as a vulnerable group,

02:09.163 --> 02:10.027
        Easily swayed.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.663
            And robert has
            paved the way?

02:11.665 --> 02:15.334
Yeah. He seemed
very enthusiastic.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.303
Tell you the truth,
I don't know robert
all that well.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.172
He visited me a couple
of times in prison,

02:20.174 --> 02:22.541
But he was very much
roderick's recruit.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.676
Then ultimately,
he never made it
to havenport,

02:24.678 --> 02:29.214
So we're kind of
winging it here.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.250
        [car approaching]

02:31.252 --> 02:33.252
            Somebody's coming.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.194
        Hey, robert.
    I'm sorry we're so late.

02:42.196 --> 02:46.398
Sorry, joe. I wanted to
bring you in a different way.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.066
        Hey. Whoa!

02:48.068 --> 02:50.169
            All of you,
            on your knees!

02:50.171 --> 02:50.936
        I--I'm sorry?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.171
            It's ok.
            You can trust us.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.338
            Woman:
            Shut up, robert.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.507
    If you want to enter,
    you must humble yourselves.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.778
    On your knees, hands
    behind your back now.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.014
            Ok.

03:02.016 --> 03:06.418
    Let's, uh--let's do
    as the nice people ask.

03:11.224 --> 03:14.226
            Joe carroll.
            So it really is you.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.628
    Oh, yes, it's me.
    Are you in charge here?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.130
    Can I have a word--

03:18.132 --> 03:19.298
        Joe!

03:19.300 --> 03:20.098
            [coughs]

03:20.100 --> 03:22.134
    There's--there's really
    no need for that.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.435
            I know out
            in the world
            you're a big deal

03:23.437 --> 03:25.737
            With a killer cult
            and a bunch
            of followers,

03:25.739 --> 03:29.708
            But in here, you
            are the follower.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.216
        No!

    mr. Hardy, mr. Hardy!

03:56.971 --> 03:58.437
        Will you confirm
        your involvement

03:58.439 --> 03:59.671
        In the search
        for lily gray?

03:59.673 --> 04:00.672
        Do you have
        anything to say?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.108
    People want to know
    what's going on.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.643

04:04.645 --> 04:07.312
            Thanks for coming
            in, mr. Hardy.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.181
            How's your wound?

04:09.183 --> 04:13.185
I'll heal.
What can I do for you?

04:14.554 --> 04:20.259
            Well, I'm inclined
            to believe you.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.326
About what?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.294
            That you saw
            joe carroll

04:22.296 --> 04:23.862
            And that he is,
            in fact, alive

04:23.864 --> 04:25.831
            And that he knew
            were on to him.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.366
            Someone warned
            him not to get
            on that plane.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.935
According to the pilot,
he received a phone call
just prior.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.270
        I went to the evidence
        warehouse in virginia

04:31.272 --> 04:33.639
        Where carroll's
        physical dna was
        being stored,

04:33.641 --> 04:36.541
        And it's possible
        that his dna had
        been swapped.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.344
        That means that he
        would have someone
        inside the bureau

04:39.346 --> 04:41.480
        This entire time.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.782
        Any ideas on who
        that may be?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.817
        I need to know.
        I cannot trust anyone.

04:45.819 --> 04:50.856
Well, by your own logic,
how can I trust you?

04:52.558 --> 04:54.726
        You're facing
        federal charges.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.228
        The only reason
        you're not in jail

04:56.230 --> 04:57.796
        Is because
        director franklin wanted

04:57.798 --> 04:58.664
        To minimize the fallout.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.866
        However, there will be
        repercussions.

05:00.868 --> 05:01.500
Gina, right?

05:01.502 --> 05:04.336
Feel free to arrest me
whenever you like,

05:04.338 --> 05:07.005
But till then...

05:07.007 --> 05:08.740
            You know,
            I actually like you.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.809
            I even respect your
            need to do this

05:10.811 --> 05:13.378
            Without
            the bureau's help,

05:13.380 --> 05:14.980
            But you put
            the people that you

05:14.982 --> 05:17.049
            Care about
            in danger,

05:17.051 --> 05:21.820
And I don't understand
or respect that.

05:29.028 --> 05:32.397
Mike, did you
get my message?

05:32.399 --> 05:33.699
They interview
luke yet?

05:33.701 --> 05:36.335
            Everyone thinks lily
            left the country.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.769
            D.C. Found several
            different properties

05:37.771 --> 05:39.204
            In various countries
            all linked to her.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.372
Yeah, but she
prepared for this.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.740
Not gonna find her
through the records.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.208
Can you get me in
to see luke?

05:43.210 --> 05:44.276
Maybe I can get
him to talk.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.578
            No. Uh, I'm leaving.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.680
What?

05:48.682 --> 05:52.184
            I'm going home,
            ryan.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.453
            I'm done.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.890
Mike, wait.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.230
        Get out! Move!

06:05.232 --> 06:06.932

still there?

06:06.934 --> 06:08.600
        Carroll:
    Still here, mouse.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.569
    It's gonna be fine.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.915
            Divest yourself
            of all your clothing
            and possessions

06:23.917 --> 06:26.151
            And place them
            in a barrel.

06:26.153 --> 06:26.651
    What?

06:26.653 --> 06:30.922
            Emma: She wants
            us to take off
            our clothes.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.326
No. It's all good.
Go ahead.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.161
            It's time
            for you to lose
            what you learned

06:36.163 --> 06:37.996
            Outside these walls.

06:37.998 --> 06:44.102
            Shower.
            Cleanse yourself.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.737
            Divest.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.241
            Mike: I asked to go.
            I want to go.

06:49.243 --> 06:49.808
Why?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.777
            I lost control.
            I almost
            killed luke.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.445
He was trying
to kill you.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.479
            You weren't
            there, ryan.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.615
            I did a lot
            more than that.
            I lost it.

06:56.617 --> 07:00.152
            I thought I was
            ready for this.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.686
            I thought...

07:01.688 --> 07:05.357
            Coming back would
            somehow help me.

07:05.359 --> 07:09.261
            A lot's happened
            in the past year--

07:09.263 --> 07:11.696
            Havenport...

07:14.300 --> 07:16.134
            Debra.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.504
            And, um, I've had
            some problems

07:19.506 --> 07:20.839
            With my friends,
            my family.

07:20.841 --> 07:26.611
            I don't
            respond to normal
            situations...

07:26.613 --> 07:27.212
            Appropriately.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.847
            I can fake it
            most of the time.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.149
            Then I cloud over.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.717
            My dad won't
            talk to me.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.852
            He--he doesn't
            get it.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.886
Can you talk
to somebody else?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.955
            I have. I've talked
            to therapists,

07:36.957 --> 07:41.526
            I've talked
            to counselors.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.961
            I need to go, ryan.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.131
            My flight's
            in the morning.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.034
            It's for the best.

07:56.742 --> 07:58.043
Ryan: For how long?

07:58.045 --> 07:58.743
            For 6 months

07:58.745 --> 07:59.711
            Or until this case
            is over,

07:59.713 --> 08:03.014
            But I'm not going
            back to the intel
            division.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.182
I'm so sorry, max.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.251
            I didn't lose
            my career yet.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.085
            I got suspended.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.553
What if I call somebody
at the bureau?

08:08.555 --> 08:09.921
            Don't, ok?

08:09.923 --> 08:13.191
            I knew the deal.
            I'm ok with this.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.359
What are you
gonna do?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.728
            I'm more worried
            about what you're
            gonna do.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.364
            It's time to
            rethink this,

08:19.366 --> 08:21.700
            What you've
            been doing,

08:21.702 --> 08:24.336
            What we've all
            been doing.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.437
I'm fine.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.438
            No. You're obsessed,

08:26.440 --> 08:27.706
            But go ahead
            and dodge the issue.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.940
        I'm not dodging
        anything,

08:28.942 --> 08:30.509
            But I'm not
            gonna stop.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.610
            I can't.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.346
Sure you can.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.448
You make the decision

08:36.450 --> 08:37.448
Right this moment.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.683
You go back to teaching,

08:38.684 --> 08:42.287
You--you forget
about all of this.

08:42.289 --> 08:46.057
            I withdrew
            for the semester.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.592
            Look. I'm not gonna
            lie to you, max.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.128
            I can't, not after
            everything you've
            done for me,

08:50.130 --> 08:54.266
            But I have to be
            the one to find him.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.434
You mean to kill him.

08:58.804 --> 09:03.241
            Yeah. I mean
            to kill him.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.046
            I stopped drinking

09:08.048 --> 09:10.916
            So I could get
            clear-headed enough
            to find him,

09:10.918 --> 09:13.618
            So I could get
            healthy enough
            to hunt him.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.622
            I started teaching
            because I knew
            it would anger him.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.257
            So this life
            you see,

09:19.259 --> 09:22.127
            It's all for him.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.564
            So am I obsessed?
            Yeah, I am,

09:25.566 --> 09:27.933
            And I'm ok with it.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.270
Maybe this new life
was for carroll,

09:32.272 --> 09:35.173
But it doesn't have
to be anymore.

09:35.175 --> 09:41.346
This is your life, ryan,
and it's very real.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.481
You have a family--

09:43.483 --> 09:47.018
Me--who loves you.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.590
Just think
about it, please.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.529
    Man on p.A.: Korban--
    love, unity, peace.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.464
        We are one.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.765
        Korban is family,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.667
        Korban is love.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.502
        Korban forever.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.171
        You can call me
        julia for now.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.206
    We have beds set up
    for you in the main dorm.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.175
Carroll: And what is
your role here, julia?

10:10.177 --> 10:12.377
        I assist micah
        in all areas
        of operation,

10:12.379 --> 10:13.878
        I'm his wife
        and lead deacon.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.981
            Why do we have to
            wear these masks?

10:15.983 --> 10:18.283
    Because you haven't
    earned an identity yet.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.684
I don't see much
identity here.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.952
I see conformity.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.721
            Emma.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.723
    What you see is unity.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.824
        You see community
        and spirit.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.693
    It's sad that you don't
    recognize that, emma.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.396
            [whispering]
            micah wants
            to see joe.

10:32.498 --> 10:35.800
It appears micah has
requested your presence.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.902
Robert will take you.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.875
    Don't fear me, girls.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.312
    I'm not your enemy,
    I'm your champion.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.682
        Come on.
    I'll show you around.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.484
            Let's go.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.593
Man: What did I
tell you, huh?

11:01.595 --> 11:02.527
What did I tell you?

11:02.529 --> 11:03.762
            You told me not to
            drink in the car.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.163
That's right,
and look what you did.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.398
You're gonna
clean it up!

11:06.400 --> 11:07.832
            Ok. I'll do it.
            Aah!

11:07.834 --> 11:09.367
I've had it with you.
Look what you did!

11:09.369 --> 11:11.603
You are such
a spoiled brat!

11:11.605 --> 11:12.671
    Come on!

11:12.673 --> 11:14.673
Aah! Aah!

11:14.675 --> 11:15.707
Aah! Ow!
That hurts!

11:15.709 --> 11:17.275
            Hey! Is there
            a problem here?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.678
This is family business.
Stay out of it!

11:19.680 --> 11:22.514
            Nypd! Step away
            from the boy.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.615
            Step away!

11:23.617 --> 11:24.849
        -Police?
        -Stay back.

11:24.851 --> 11:28.086
    Are you all right, son?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.587
            Smile, miss hardy.

11:29.589 --> 11:32.357
        [grunting]

11:53.713 --> 11:55.814
            Did I do good?

11:56.649 --> 11:59.117
    You did great, son.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.258
    [cell phone vibrating]

12:12.832 --> 12:14.432
Hello, ryan.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.767
I'm sorry it's
come to this,

12:15.769 --> 12:17.836
But I don't know
any other way

12:17.838 --> 12:21.740
To express what
my loss feels like.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.775
You take from me,

12:23.777 --> 12:26.911
I take from you.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.338
    [indistinct chatter]

12:53.773 --> 12:57.308
        [women giggling]

13:04.116 --> 13:05.183
            You wanted to
            see us?

13:05.185 --> 13:08.319
        Micah: Oh, yes.
        Thank you, girls.

13:08.321 --> 13:12.457
        Beautiful work.
    We'll continue tomorrow.

13:17.396 --> 13:20.298
        Blessed be
        the children.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.713
I'm micah.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.082
It's nice to
meet you.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.184
Robert, you wait
outside.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.718
I want to do some
private bonding

13:40.720 --> 13:43.321
With our new friend.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.389
Ok. You guys, too.

13:44.391 --> 13:49.661
I'll scream if our guest
gets all alpha on me.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.897
Take off the mask.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.771
Yep. That's really you.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.406
Damn.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.577
It's good to meet
you, micah.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.053
            You may not sit
            at my table.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.589
        No. No.
        Of course not.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.190
    How presumptuous of me.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.692
So, joe carroll,
you're a dead man.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.926
How'd you pull
that off?

14:21.928 --> 14:24.863
        Oh, it's--it's
        all in the details.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.898
So you faked it.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.700
        As opposed to?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.034
So cool what you did
last year

14:30.036 --> 14:31.603
With your--
with your cult.
Mad props.

14:31.605 --> 14:34.372
I was impressed
the way you organized

14:34.374 --> 14:37.108
And gathered
all your followers.

14:37.110 --> 14:42.080
Dude, how did you get
them to kill for you?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.282
        I've always had
        an innate ability

14:44.284 --> 14:46.784
        To--to connect
        with people.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.054
So I'm guessing you're
looking for a place
to hide out,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.489
Korban is your
crib of choice.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.659
        I'm interested in more
        than just refuge.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.761
What can you
offer me, joe?

14:56.763 --> 14:59.964
You're, like, the world's
most deadly killer.

14:59.966 --> 15:04.102
Why would I welcome
you into my kingdom?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.604
        $30,000 in a bag
        in my car.

15:06.606 --> 15:10.074
Yep. Got it. Thank you
for your donation.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.443
What else?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.846
        I think,
        given the chance,

15:14.848 --> 15:16.314
        I could be of great help

15:16.316 --> 15:18.483
        To both you
        and your cause.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.617
How so?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.353
        You tell me.
        Surely you must have

15:22.355 --> 15:23.955
        Something in mind.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.123
        Otherwise, I wouldn't
        be here.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.991
Heh heh! I could find
some use for you,

15:26.993 --> 15:29.027
But the question is
your commitment

15:29.029 --> 15:31.362
And can I trust you?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.831
This is
the micah show here,

15:33.833 --> 15:39.837
And you need to be
down with that,

15:39.839 --> 15:42.140
But are you?

15:47.813 --> 15:50.682
            I need your help,
            micah.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.951
            I offer you
            my humble service

15:52.953 --> 15:58.623
            In exchange
            for--for your
            hospitality.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.559
Mendez: Ryan, I'm sorry
about max.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.727
            Anything?

16:02.729 --> 16:04.529
        Lawrence: Lily gray's
        e-mail was tracked
        to a coffee shop

16:04.531 --> 16:05.730
    Just outside boston.

16:05.732 --> 16:06.998
Open wi-fi.
Whoever sent it

16:07.000 --> 16:08.132
Didn't even have to get
out of their car.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.367
    Any witnesses
    to max's abduction?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.169
    It happened right
    outside her apartment.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.337
        Garage was already
        processed.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.305
        Security cameras
        were disabled.
        No eye witnesses.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.474
    Ok. We know the abductor
        was using an suv,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.309
    Late seventies model,
    male on camera

16:18.311 --> 16:20.545
        Wearing a brown
    work jacket, flannel shirt.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.080
All right, everybody.
Eyes up.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.381
We're looking
for two suspects.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.016
    We got camera footage
    from both corners

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
    Near her apartment. Hey.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.353
        I thought you left.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.988
Mendez called me.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.156
I'm here, ryan.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.024
        Thank you.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.327
            Mendez: Ryan,
            what time did she
            leave your place?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.228
    Uh, it was around 2:00.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.396
        She said she
        was heading home.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.498
That puts her home
near just after 2:30.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.200
Let's go.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.105
        There!

16:47.107 --> 16:48.239
        Work jacket,
        flannel shirt.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.609
Mike: What about
the license plate?

16:51.611 --> 16:52.577
    It's been taped over.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.611
            That's the best
            I can do.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.580
Well, put it through
facial recognition.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.080
Come on.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.783
        There's a person
    that could help us--luke.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.119
    Lily sent this guy
    to punish me for luke.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.054
    He would know who he is,
        where lily is.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.021
    Luke would know.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.023
        Well, he's recovering
        because he was
        almost killed,

17:06.026 --> 17:07.692
            And he's
            refusing to talk.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.560
    Let me try.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.228
        Max is not dead,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.563
        Or it would be
        on that tape,
        and it's not.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.767
    We are wasting time.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.770
        Please, gina.

17:25.243 --> 17:27.278
        [gasps]

17:35.354 --> 17:37.288
    Hi.

17:39.024 --> 17:41.392
Nice to meet you, max.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.601
Is that a tattoo?

17:50.603 --> 17:53.304
            [grunting]

17:53.306 --> 17:56.607
Well, isn't
that something?

18:01.180 --> 18:02.647
Do you have any more?

18:02.649 --> 18:05.316
            Where--where am I?

18:09.188 --> 18:11.022
Look at this.

18:12.191 --> 18:16.427
Heh heh.
It's a butterfly.

18:22.301 --> 18:25.670
I've got lots
of tattoos.

18:25.672 --> 18:29.874
I really like
this one.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.709
It's pretty, right?

18:32.878 --> 18:36.547
Come on. Tell me.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.487
Do you have any more
tattoos?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.232
            [buzzer]

18:58.237 --> 19:00.071
Ryan: Hey!

19:02.007 --> 19:04.208
I came to see you,

19:04.210 --> 19:07.545
But first, they have
to secure me.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.080
They don't trust me.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.348
Anger issues.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.250
            [buzzer]

19:12.252 --> 19:16.254
So...How you feeling?

19:17.923 --> 19:20.024
Listen. I'm sorry
about giselle,

19:20.026 --> 19:21.225
But she was trying
to kill me.

19:21.227 --> 19:24.362
I mean, you can't hold
that against me.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.764
I mean, what would you do
in my situation, huh?

19:26.766 --> 19:27.832
            What do you want?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.433
I need your help, luke,

19:29.435 --> 19:31.736
And I know you have
no reason to help me,

19:31.738 --> 19:34.338
But I really hope
that you will.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.907
            I'm not gonna help
            you find my mother.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.008
This is not
about your mother.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.110
            She really liked
            you, you know?

19:39.112 --> 19:40.411
Aw. That's so nice to hear,

19:40.413 --> 19:45.416
But I need your help
finding this guy.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.586
            Ooh. Ooh, ooh.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.522
            You don't want
            find that guy.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.057
            He's bad news.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.258
            If you're looking
            for him,

19:54.260 --> 19:55.893
            You must be
            in real trouble.

19:55.895 --> 19:56.594
Why is that?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.296
            A little too gory
            for my mom's taste.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.130
So your mom knows him?

19:59.132 --> 20:00.631
            My mom knows lots
            of people, ryan.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.200
            She's been looking
            for the right guy

20:02.202 --> 20:05.236
            For a really,
            really long time,

20:05.238 --> 20:09.040
            And they're not
            all princes.

20:09.042 --> 20:13.711
            There's a lot
            of toads out there.

20:13.713 --> 20:19.283
So...Your mom was
auditioning killers?

20:19.285 --> 20:22.920
            Ha! No, no, no, no.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.290
            No, not killers,
            ryan.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.592
            People.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.760
            She just wants
            to be loved

20:29.762 --> 20:31.329
            Like everybody else.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.432
            She just wants
            someone to
            understand her

20:34.434 --> 20:38.169
            And accept her
            for who she is.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.304
            I mean, no one wants
            to be alone.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.640
So where can I find
this guy?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.942
            You already
            know him.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.010
            Everybody does.

20:46.012 --> 20:46.944
What's his name?

20:46.946 --> 20:50.281
            Why do you need to
            know his--

20:50.283 --> 20:51.482
            Ha ha ha!

20:51.484 --> 20:55.186
            I know what's
            happening. Ha!

20:55.188 --> 20:57.321
            Mom got clever.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.624
            Tit for tat.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.125
            Oh.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.961
            This guy, he's hot
            for my mom.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.497
            He'll do anything
            for her.

21:06.499 --> 21:12.370
            Ha ha ha!
            What did he do?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.338
            Ooh!

21:15.874 --> 21:18.342
Who is he?

21:18.344 --> 21:21.612
            His name's kurt
            something or other.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.180
            I don't know
            his last name,

21:23.182 --> 21:24.148
            But...

21:24.150 --> 21:29.053
            You know him as
            the huntsman.

21:31.723 --> 21:34.325
    Mike: The huntsman
    is a known serial killer
    of women, all prostitutes.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.061
    He's believed to be
in the northeast coast region

21:37.063 --> 21:37.895
        Of the country.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.630
    He's been evading
    quantico for years--

21:39.965 --> 21:41.232
        No eye witnesses,
        no survivors.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.401
    Now the victim's time
    of death is roughly

21:43.403 --> 21:44.468
        24 hours
    after their abduction.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.671
    They're all killed
    with a high-velocity bow.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.872
            I see a lot of
            superficial cuts

21:47.874 --> 21:49.407
            On their faces,
            arms, legs.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.508
    Yeah, we believe those
    were sustained while

21:50.510 --> 21:52.243
    They ran for their lives
    through the woods.

21:52.245 --> 21:55.579
    He hunted them like prey.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.315
            He's
            a mission killer.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.317
            He's ridding
            the world of sin.

21:59.319 --> 22:04.255
            He hunts them,
            he guts them,
            he skins them.

22:04.257 --> 22:05.523
        We know what
        he looks like.

22:05.525 --> 22:09.493
Mendez: And we've
got a first name. Kurt.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.395
Come on, guys.
We've only got 12 hours

22:11.397 --> 22:12.496
If he sticks
to this m.O.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.365
I need those
dmv records.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.399
        Max is not his
        typical victim.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.368
    He may be following
    different methods.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.670
            Lawrence:
            I have a match.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.674
        Kurt bolen
    of trenton, new jersey.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.210
            That's him.
            Let's go!

22:26.212 --> 22:27.411
Carroll: What is this?

22:27.413 --> 22:28.179
            The reckoning.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.281
            It's perfectly safe.

22:30.283 --> 22:31.015
    Right.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.850
            All community
            members have been

22:32.951 --> 22:34.785
        Through the reckoning
        many times.

22:39.624 --> 22:43.527
            This works better
            if you remain still.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.563
    Ok.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.604
            May I?

22:55.340 --> 22:57.541
Of course.

23:02.347 --> 23:05.449
        I'm gonna ask you
        a series of questions.

23:05.451 --> 23:08.319
        These electrodes
        will measure your
        blood pressure,

23:08.321 --> 23:10.388
        Breathing rate,
        and body temp.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.457
Oh. So it's
a glorified lie detector.

23:13.459 --> 23:17.395
Mmm. I should warn you
that these machines

23:17.397 --> 23:19.063
Tend not to work
terribly well

23:19.065 --> 23:22.500
On people with my
psychological profile.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.069
            You mean sociopaths?

23:27.038 --> 23:27.772
            Psychopaths?

23:27.774 --> 23:33.344
Oh. Who wants to be
reduced to a label, hmm?

23:33.346 --> 23:36.947
            People of your
            ilk may respond
            differently,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.582
            But they do respond.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.486
A response that allows
you to determine
truthfulness?

23:42.488 --> 23:44.355
            I'm very good
            at this.

23:44.357 --> 23:46.257
            Let me just get
            a level.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.292
            Your name is
            joe carroll?

23:48.294 --> 23:50.094
Yes.

23:52.564 --> 23:57.468
        Did you like the view
        of my breasts when
        I leaned over?

23:57.470 --> 23:59.603
No.

24:01.373 --> 24:06.477
            See? It works. Liar.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.344
Heh.

24:07.346 --> 24:09.513
            Shall we begin?

24:09.515 --> 24:11.849
By all means.

24:12.384 --> 24:15.052
            [sirens]

24:37.342 --> 24:38.809
        Move in, move in!

24:38.811 --> 24:41.212
            Ohh!

24:41.214 --> 24:43.314
                Don't move!
                Hands up!

24:46.952 --> 24:49.153
        Is kurt bolen
        your husband?

24:49.155 --> 24:50.521
    Where is he?
    Where is he?!

24:50.523 --> 24:53.424
            He w-went away
            for a few days.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.525
Boy: Mom!

24:54.527 --> 24:56.360
            Come here.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.597
        Come here.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.265
            Ok.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.005
            We don't have
            time for this.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.507
    I know that this is
    difficult to accept,

25:09.509 --> 25:10.641
    But we need your help.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.043
            No. I told you.
            He's traveling
            for work.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.845
            He sells
            office supplies.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.614
Mike: We checked.
There's no business trip.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.583
            What? No.
            This is impossible.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.819
    Come on, shannon.
    Don't be that wife.

25:21.887 --> 25:22.887
    You know it's true.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.088
    Boy: Hey! Shut up!

25:24.090 --> 25:25.523
    You don't know my dad.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.190
            Chris!

25:26.591 --> 25:28.425
    You don't know him.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.632
Yeah. Look
at that camera angle.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.499
Max is about 5'8".

25:35.501 --> 25:37.601
That camera's shooting
up at her from below.

25:38.136 --> 25:39.603
        You think whoever
        shot this was
        shorter than her.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.772
By about a foot.

25:50.148 --> 25:53.050
            Hey. You can't
            just come in here.

25:53.052 --> 25:53.951
            This is my room.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.720
        Where's your
        father, chris?

25:56.722 --> 25:57.354
What?

25:57.356 --> 25:58.923
    Where is your father?

25:58.925 --> 25:59.890
Why are you
asking me?

25:59.892 --> 26:03.661
            Because I think
            you shot that.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.996
        No, I didn't.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.064
            You see that girl?

26:07.599 --> 26:11.335
            That's my niece.
            That's my family,

26:11.337 --> 26:14.638
            And I'm not gonna
            let your sick,
            twisted father

26:14.640 --> 26:16.574
            Kill my niece.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.809
Is she a whore?

26:20.045 --> 26:21.579

40:10.142 --> 40:11.241
    No.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.008
            Are you staying?

40:12.010 --> 40:14.144
I'm leaving
in the morning.

40:14.146 --> 40:15.345
Hey.

40:15.347 --> 40:16.446
            How's max?

40:16.448 --> 40:17.514
She's good.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.816
    [cell phone vibrating]

40:19.818 --> 40:22.685
        Lily just sent me
            a text.

40:22.687 --> 40:23.820
It's another link
to a video.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.356
            All right.
            Let's get it up
            on the big screen.

40:26.358 --> 40:28.091
Hey, hopkins.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.131
    Lily: Hello, ryan.

40:35.133 --> 40:35.999
Mendez: Is this live?

40:36.001 --> 40:38.034
            Hopkins: No.
            It's time-stamped
            a few hours ago.

40:38.036 --> 40:41.137
    Where is she? House,
    dining room, where?

40:41.139 --> 40:42.972
        Lily: I'm sorry
        about your niece.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.508
        She must be
        a terrible loss
        in your life.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.210
            She doesn't realize
            you saved her.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.878
    I have one more surprise.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.382
    You weren't the only
    one to hurt me, ryan.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.853
    Another was involved,
    and he must pay
    for what he...

40:56.855 --> 40:58.888
I know that place.
That's my dad's house.

40:58.890 --> 40:59.889
        Did to luke.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.291
She's in his
living room. Oh, my god.

41:01.293 --> 41:02.892
        Say hello to your
        son, richard.

41:02.894 --> 41:03.827
    Go to hell.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.528
All right. Somebody, help.

        All right.

41:08.166 --> 41:08.998

41:09.000 --> 41:09.899

41:09.901 --> 41:12.001

    surprises for you, ryan.

41:45.469 --> 41:47.670

42:01.852 --> 42:03.553
                Mike.

42:17.735 --> 42:20.370
Oh, mike.

42:25.009 --> 42:28.545
            He's gone.
            He's gone.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.813
            Oh, my god.

42:37.054 --> 42:40.089
