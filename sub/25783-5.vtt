02:16.960 --> 02:18.711
So exciting

02:18.794 --> 02:20.752
Why, thank you.
I'm excited to be here.

Hey, it's Mary in reception.

02:24.627 --> 02:26.794
I have Jason Taylor

03:19.168 --> 03:21.669
I can't. I have a family

Oh. What are your kids' names?

No problem.
I'm Spencer Strasmore.

04:34.419 --> 04:37.627
I'm Sean, this is Nick,
we are with Distribution
and Acquisitions.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.085
So you guys are in charge
of my channel.

04:40.168 --> 04:43.168
- Yeah, we are.
- Thanks for meeting
on short notice.

04:43.252 --> 04:44.836
I never took you for
an action sports guy.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.544
Because I'm not.
But I do like making money.

04:47.627 --> 04:49.711
Well, how can we
help you make more?

04:49.794 --> 04:51.502
Let's start by getting me
a better channel.

04:51.586 --> 04:53.002
Getting me
out of the nosebleeds.

04:53.085 --> 04:56.210
How do I get around
Fox Sports Net, NBC Sports?

04:56.294 --> 04:58.752
I'm sure one of
your computer geek experts

04:58.836 --> 05:01.627
can just type on the keyboard
and move me on down the line.

05:01.711 --> 05:03.877
It's really not that easy.
Besides, it doesn't matter

05:03.960 --> 05:06.460
where your house is located
if nobody will come visit.

05:06.544 --> 05:08.960
- You're referring
to our fan base?
- Nick: Or lack thereof.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.877
You guys have  no fan base.
Zero. None.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.502
- Are you exaggerating?
Come on.
- Sean: No, he's not.

05:14.586 --> 05:17.502
You polled at 0.001.

05:17.586 --> 05:20.502
You went dark last week--
how many calls
do you think we got?

05:20.586 --> 05:22.210
- I'm guessing zero.
- Bingo.

05:22.294 --> 05:24.294
You should be more concerned
with being dropped
from our system.

05:24.377 --> 05:25.877
Obviously Lance
didn't give a shit

05:25.960 --> 05:28.085
about making money,
or ratings, but I do.

05:28.168 --> 05:31.168
The dark days are over.
I need you guys
to help me help myself.

05:31.252 --> 05:33.127
Well, as you said,
in so many words,

05:33.210 --> 05:35.210
content that
moves the needle--

05:35.294 --> 05:37.085
like your old sport.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.419
Those rights are spoken for.

05:38.502 --> 05:39.711
Yeah, I know.
We own them.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.127
Surf and skate
will never work

05:41.210 --> 05:42.252

Spencer.

05:42.335 --> 05:43.335
We know what works,

05:43.419 --> 05:45.002
and we just want
to get more of it.

05:46.544 --> 05:49.627
- What about college football?
- We'd love that.

05:49.711 --> 05:51.836
Our SEC Network
is killing it.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.586
Do you have exclusive rights
to anything?

05:53.669 --> 05:55.085
I don't, but I can get access.

05:55.168 --> 05:58.043
Great. But we're only
interested in brand names--

05:58.127 --> 05:59.294
Notre Dame, Ohio State,

05:59.377 --> 06:02.502
or if it's a big market team
like USC.

06:02.586 --> 06:04.502
And prying them loose
ain't gonna be easy,
as you know.

06:04.586 --> 06:06.377
Let me worry
about the prying, huh?

06:06.460 --> 06:09.586
Deliver that,
and we can deliver

06:38.085 --> 06:40.294
Hey, are you planning
on addressing the team?

06:40.377 --> 06:42.877

I might make myself

What do you think about that?
That's a great idea.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.127
You know where Lance
kept the liquor?

06:53.210 --> 06:54.502
We don't have liquor
in the office.

Keep my black ass

What? You slippin', man.
Season's just around the corner.

08:44.752 --> 08:47.252
Ain't like that.
I'm tryin' to lean up, bro.

08:47.335 --> 08:48.419
Get quicker.

08:48.502 --> 08:50.335

09:19.294 --> 09:21.335
Yeah. That's why I'm out here,
meet with Chuck, handle shit.

09:37.752 --> 09:41.669
Ah. Desperate times...
call for desperate measures.

09:41.752 --> 09:44.335
Look to your left

09:44.419 --> 09:48.377
These are your brothers
and sisters in fuckin' arms!

These are the people
whose fuckin' bodily fluids

09:52.460 --> 09:54.711
are gonna be drenching
your hands as you

09:54.794 --> 09:58.544
fuckin' shove their small
intestine back up
into their body,

09:58.627 --> 10:00.960

fuckin' die on me!

10:01.043 --> 10:03.918
You never walked away
from a fight in your life!"

10:04.002 --> 10:06.460

- "Times are so tough."

10:06.544 --> 10:09.168
Fuck you, times are tough.

10:09.252 --> 10:10.460
We're tougher!

10:10.544 --> 10:14.210
We eat glass and fuckin'
crap diamonds, bro.

10:14.294 --> 10:16.960
Doink! "Oh, another
fuckin' diamond.

10:17.043 --> 10:19.335
I'm rich because
I was fuckin' tough."

10:19.419 --> 10:22.002
But, like in all times of war,

10:22.085 --> 10:24.335
there are casualties. Right?

10:24.419 --> 10:26.794
And ours happen
to be financial.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.127
So, um, as of this moment,

10:29.210 --> 10:31.335
I'm gonna have to freeze
all the expense accounts.

10:31.419 --> 10:33.669
We're gonna have to cut back
in other ways too,

10:33.752 --> 10:35.960
like I was thinkin'
maybe half-hour lunches
for a while?

10:36.043 --> 10:39.294
- Just for a while.
- ( man whispers )
Shoulda gone with Lance.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.711
Hey, Kurt Cobain.
What were you just saying?

10:41.794 --> 10:43.669
- Do you have a question?
- Uh, just sayin' that

10:43.752 --> 10:46.960
your motivational speech
was, uh, motivational.

10:47.043 --> 10:49.711
I don't think
that's what you said
in that short amount of time.

10:49.794 --> 10:52.586
- What did he say?
- That we should have
left with Lance.

10:52.669 --> 10:54.043
Fuck, dude!

10:54.127 --> 10:57.252
Then why don't you do me
the favor

10:57.335 --> 10:58.877
of grabbing all your shit

10:58.960 --> 11:00.544
and gettin'
the fuck out of here,

11:00.627 --> 11:02.669
'cause you're fired.
All right? Adios.

11:02.752 --> 11:05.502
Give Lance my warmest regards.

11:05.586 --> 11:07.836
Fuck you, who cares.
Hey, and also,

11:07.918 --> 11:09.918
may as well get
your shit too and go,

11:10.002 --> 11:12.502
because you're a snitch. OK?

11:12.586 --> 11:14.502
We're a troop of soldiers.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.419
- Get out!
- This place sucked anyway.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.752
It sure did suck...

11:18.836 --> 11:21.752
until you left,
which is... now.

11:21.836 --> 11:23.544
- ( door slams )
- ( exhales )

11:23.627 --> 11:26.460
For the rest of us,
I know it's hard,

11:26.544 --> 11:28.586
but we gotta get after it!

11:28.669 --> 11:30.419
All of our remaining clients,

11:30.502 --> 11:33.002
we gotta put back
to fuckin' work.

11:33.085 --> 11:36.419
Book, book, book, book!
That is your mantra.

11:36.502 --> 11:39.252
And if we book,
come Christmastime

11:39.335 --> 11:43.586
Santa Claus is gonna put
a little something extra
in your stockings.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.294
( approving murmurs )

11:45.377 --> 11:47.877
Thank you all for taking
this journey with us.

11:49.294 --> 11:52.460
- Great stuff.
- Yeah. I'm drunk.

11:52.544 --> 11:55.210
So, Lance is on hold
for you.

11:56.586 --> 11:58.502
Do you want to take it...

11:58.586 --> 12:00.669
or should I take
that pep talk to heart

12:00.752 --> 12:03.960
and tell him
to suck a bag of dicks?

Hey. Can I help you?

12:33.460 --> 12:35.960
I doubt it.
I'm here to see him.

12:36.043 --> 12:38.377
You and everybody else.
He don't want to be disturbed.

12:42.085 --> 12:43.794
( laughs ) Shit.

12:43.877 --> 12:45.335
Yo! What's up, brother?

12:45.419 --> 12:47.586
- ( whistle blows )
- Yo, Q!

12:49.586 --> 12:50.794
Hold up.

12:52.252 --> 12:53.918
- You must be Spencer.
- I am.

12:54.002 --> 12:56.335
My mom said to expect you.
What can I do for you?

12:56.419 --> 12:59.335
More like what
I could do for you.

12:59.419 --> 13:02.502
- How you know my mom?
- We're just friends.

13:02.586 --> 13:04.752
You got a thing for her?

13:04.836 --> 13:06.210
It's a'ight,
everybody does.

13:06.294 --> 13:07.877
You ain't gotta be
all awkward and shit.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.210
- It ain't about that, brother.
- No? What's it about?

13:10.294 --> 13:13.043
Your mom thought
that I could give you
some good advice.

13:13.127 --> 13:17.377
I've been through the league,
All- Pro, Super Bowl champ,
I'm up for the Hall.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.085
You've got a lot
of choices to make,

13:19.168 --> 13:21.210
and I could
help you with those.

13:21.294 --> 13:24.043
Wow. I appreciate it.

13:24.127 --> 13:26.794
But there's no need
for the résumé,
future Hall-of-Famer.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.836
No need for the advice, either.
But I got some for you.

13:29.918 --> 13:34.043
- Yeah, what's that?
- Be careful with my moms.

13:34.127 --> 13:35.460
All right, boys,
let's go!

13:35.544 --> 13:38.544
I'm always
fuckin' careful.

13:38.627 --> 13:40.586
( back-up alarm beeping )

13:48.460 --> 13:51.877
Ooh hoo hoo
hoo hoo hoo!

13:51.960 --> 13:54.711
Wow! And I thought
it was an undertaking

13:54.794 --> 13:56.918
when me and the wife
remodeled the kitchen--

13:57.002 --> 13:59.502
but this place is really
coming together, Mr. Thompson.

13:59.586 --> 14:02.752
No shit, Charles.
Mr. Kroenke is a visionary.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.752
Might come as a surprise to you,

14:04.836 --> 14:07.377
but these things
don't happen by accident.

14:07.460 --> 14:11.252
No. No. Why is it
you wanted to see me, sir?

14:11.335 --> 14:14.794
I just want to make sure
that we're all rowing
in the same direction.

14:14.877 --> 14:16.836
Of course.
My guys are ready.

14:16.918 --> 14:18.335
Locked and loaded
for free agency.

14:18.419 --> 14:20.544
We've circled guys
like Alshon Jeffery,
maybe--

14:20.627 --> 14:22.419
What about Teague?
How we doin' with Teague?

14:22.502 --> 14:25.043
He's probably gonna
be a little pricier
than we thought.

14:25.127 --> 14:26.711
Take a look around you
for a second.

14:26.794 --> 14:28.794
How much do you think
we're spending here?

14:28.877 --> 14:30.586
A few more dollars
isn't gonna do anything.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.085
Gimme a coupla doubles,
all right?

14:32.168 --> 14:33.877
I thought it was my job
to be smart and frugal.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.210
No. Your job is to support
the wunderkind.

14:37.294 --> 14:42.960
If he wants Kisan,
then just give him Kisan.

14:43.043 --> 14:44.918
- Vendor: Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:45.002 --> 14:47.627
Yeah, but the GM's
supposed to make
all personnel decisions.

14:47.711 --> 14:49.460
It says so right there
in my contract.

14:49.544 --> 14:51.627
I don't give a fuck
what your contract says.

14:51.711 --> 14:55.168
All right? Look,
McVay likes the player,

14:55.252 --> 14:57.460
and we just happen to love
his personality.

14:57.544 --> 14:59.377
Huh? His personality?

14:59.460 --> 15:02.419
We've got some
great young talent
on this team.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.544
- Yeah.
- Coach is putting up
almost 30-plus points a game.

15:05.627 --> 15:08.669
- Hell, yeah.
- But we need a little more...
swagger!

15:08.752 --> 15:10.294
- Swagger.
- You know what I'm sayin'?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.294
Other than McVay's.

15:12.377 --> 15:14.752
Look, Charles,

15:14.836 --> 15:16.627
no disrespect to you, OK?

15:16.711 --> 15:20.627
But I wouldn't exactly
call you charismatic.

15:20.711 --> 15:24.419
It takes a lot more
than just wins
to succeed in L.A.

15:24.502 --> 15:27.502
You gotta do it with style,
with some panache.

15:27.586 --> 15:30.252
- Panache.
- Yeah. You can't
buy taste, Charles.

15:30.335 --> 15:34.586
But you can  buy yourself
some new clothes. Yeah.

15:34.669 --> 15:36.627
Why don't you get yourself
a fuckin' suit?

15:36.711 --> 15:40.252
You'd look great
in a suit. OK?

15:40.335 --> 15:41.377
All right.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.836
It's a beautiful vista
you've brought us to.

15:46.918 --> 15:48.918
Or is this a mesa?

15:49.002 --> 15:52.669
Well, technically,
to use the accurate
geographical term,

15:52.752 --> 15:54.960
- this is a bluff.
- Bluff.

15:55.043 --> 15:57.877
You should see it
at magic hour, Joe,
it comes alive.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.002
I thought with you and I,
everything was magic.

16:00.085 --> 16:03.210
Well, it was,
then you brought your
beefcake boyfriend on the scene.

16:03.294 --> 16:06.294
- OK.
- I never had a brother,
always wanted one.

16:06.377 --> 16:08.043
I know you
don't have siblings.

16:08.127 --> 16:09.836
Sadly, I was
an only child.

16:09.918 --> 16:12.210
And I still wasn't
my parents' favorite.

16:12.294 --> 16:14.043
I can relate to that.

16:14.127 --> 16:16.460
Joe, I'm really sorry
about everything that
went down between us.

16:16.544 --> 16:18.127
Yeah, so am I.

16:19.794 --> 16:22.210
Obviously I can't reverse time,

16:22.294 --> 16:24.168
but I can press reset.

16:24.252 --> 16:26.627
Joe, I'm willing
to give you 75 cents
on the dollar,

16:26.711 --> 16:28.085
buy my company back,

16:28.168 --> 16:30.377
and then you
and the glamorous potato

16:30.460 --> 16:32.502
of whom you are
peculiarly enamored

16:32.586 --> 16:34.627
can go back to Miami,
focus on what you're good at,

16:34.711 --> 16:36.711
where footballers need you.

16:36.794 --> 16:39.043
( takes deep breath )

16:39.127 --> 16:41.294
I'll think about it.
OK? I will.

16:41.377 --> 16:43.294
And I'll talk to the potato.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.085
Don't be a dummy, Joe.

16:45.168 --> 16:48.627
This world was never
gonna work out for
a guy like like Spencer.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.127
I don't know.
Maybe a world like this

16:52.210 --> 16:54.419
is never gonna work
for a guy like me.

16:54.502 --> 16:56.168
One time, right here, we have

16:56.252 --> 16:59.419
the league legend
against the young buck,

16:59.502 --> 17:02.252
only at Unbreakable.
Step right up, folks!

17:02.335 --> 17:03.918
Come on, Rick,
fuck this bitch up.

17:04.002 --> 17:05.168
Hey, watch your language,

17:05.252 --> 17:06.460
Terrence Tyrone Darby!

17:06.544 --> 17:08.252
I run a place of business!

17:08.335 --> 17:10.586
- Goin' down, Jerret.
- I don't go down for nobody.

17:10.669 --> 17:11.627
We'll see.

17:11.711 --> 17:12.960
Ready, ready, ready? Go!

17:13.043 --> 17:15.836
( crowd shouting encouragement )

17:18.294 --> 17:20.669
- Man: Jerret, let's go!
- Time!

17:22.127 --> 17:23.544
Jay:
Don't be breakin' Unbreakable.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.836
Come on now! Let's go!

17:25.918 --> 17:28.127
Must be the baby.
She keepin' you up at night?

17:28.210 --> 17:31.294
I live in
a 12,000-square-foot mansion,
not a condo like yours.

17:31.377 --> 17:33.794
Besides, baby ain't the problem,
'cause there ain't no problem.

17:33.877 --> 17:35.752
I can do this shit
all fuckin' day.

17:35.836 --> 17:38.752
- TTD: All day.
- Kisan: You gonna need to.

17:38.836 --> 17:41.043
Come on, Ricky,
do it for us old guys!
I mean "veterans."

17:41.127 --> 17:42.294
Yves: Come on, man!

17:42.377 --> 17:43.960
- Get him!
- Come on, man!

17:44.043 --> 17:45.335
Gettin' tired of this,
Jerret?

17:47.711 --> 17:49.627
Fourth quarter, buddy.
We're goin' behind
the rib cage.

17:49.711 --> 17:52.752
- Let's go. Come on, buddy.
- Get it, baby.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.335
( cheering, applause )

17:58.419 --> 18:00.669
Nobody rollin' up on me,
especially not this young boy.

18:00.752 --> 18:02.752
You ain't never
gone deep in your life.

18:02.836 --> 18:05.836
- Feel me, Jay?
- Got you, buddy, I like it.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.960
That was cute.

18:09.043 --> 18:11.043
That was real cute, Jerret.

18:11.127 --> 18:12.918
Don't get scared now, Jerret.

18:17.918 --> 18:20.502
( crowd oohs and aahs )

18:20.586 --> 18:22.669
( applauding )

18:22.752 --> 18:24.502
You can keep living
in a fantasy world,

18:24.586 --> 18:26.335
or you might want
to accept the fact

18:26.419 --> 18:28.085
that you're gettin'
too old for this shit, bro.

18:28.168 --> 18:29.168
No disrespect.

18:29.252 --> 18:31.002
- Right?
- None taken.

18:31.085 --> 18:33.210
Don't let that nigga
get in your head.
That shit'll fuck you up.

18:33.294 --> 18:35.627
Just you sayin' that's
fuckin' me up.
Get outta my face.

18:35.711 --> 18:37.294
Hey, we're goin' harder
tomorrow.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.419
Go pop a cryo
and an IV. Good?

18:43.711 --> 18:45.877
Fuck that high-jumpin' ass--

18:47.586 --> 18:49.794
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Spencer: Well, it didn't.

18:49.877 --> 18:52.294
Ohh. I was worried
about that.

18:52.377 --> 18:55.210
Me too. I thought
I had all the answers
when I was his age.

18:55.294 --> 18:56.502
Did you?

18:56.586 --> 18:58.127
- I still don't.
- Join the club.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.377
I think it's time
to drill down

19:00.460 --> 19:02.085
on that sweet child o' mine.

19:02.168 --> 19:03.544
Can you come to dinner?

19:03.627 --> 19:05.586
Are you gonna
force-feed me to him?

19:05.669 --> 19:07.335
That's how bad-ass moms do it.

19:07.419 --> 19:08.711
Besides, I'm cookin'.

19:08.794 --> 19:10.502
Should I manage
my expectations?

19:10.586 --> 19:13.085
You should know
whatever I think
is worth doing

19:13.168 --> 19:14.544
is worth doing right.

19:14.627 --> 19:15.877
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.960
Ciao.

19:18.836 --> 19:21.168
Enough with the fuckin'
"ciaos" already.

19:21.252 --> 19:22.836
Jesus Christ.

19:24.586 --> 19:25.794
( sighs )

19:28.794 --> 19:30.502
( students chatter )

19:44.836 --> 19:47.669
Thompson's telling me
I gotta get McVay Kisan!

19:47.752 --> 19:50.002
Tellin' me I gotta worry
about filling seats!

19:50.085 --> 19:51.752
Talking about
winning ain't enough.

19:51.836 --> 19:53.711
What the hell he mean,
winning ain't enough?!

19:53.794 --> 19:56.294
These people are about
to give me an anxiety disorder

19:56.377 --> 19:57.711
like my assistant got.

19:57.794 --> 20:01.168
Mine's generalized anxiety.
Yours is specific.

20:01.252 --> 20:03.627
Charles: You need
to mind your business.

20:03.711 --> 20:05.752
Good. Now we got
some privacy.

20:05.836 --> 20:07.836
I can't face-fuck
right now, all right?

20:07.918 --> 20:10.752
I can't get this image of McVay
out of my head!

20:10.836 --> 20:13.627
How many times
do I have to remind you--
it's La La Land.

20:13.711 --> 20:15.877
You're not gonna start
singing and dancing again,
are you?

20:15.960 --> 20:18.252
No. I just mean
it's L.A., baby.

20:18.335 --> 20:19.711
Embrace the glitter.

20:19.794 --> 20:21.669
We got Jared Goff,
number one draft pick!

20:21.752 --> 20:24.586
Aaron Donald, he breathes,
eats, sleeps sacks!

20:24.669 --> 20:27.294
We put up 29 points a game
last season!

20:27.377 --> 20:29.794
- That ain't enough glitter?!
- Look at the Lakers.

20:29.877 --> 20:31.960
They departed
from what worked
with their prodigal son,

20:32.043 --> 20:34.043
and how'd that turn out?
Not so great.

20:34.127 --> 20:36.419
But now they're back on track
with Magic.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.127
Let me get this straight, baby.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.377
So the Rams are the Lakers,

20:40.460 --> 20:42.168
and you want me to be Magic?

20:42.252 --> 20:43.627
All I'm saying is,
you have to learn

20:43.711 --> 20:44.960
to be a showman, Charles.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.627
Give the people an experience.

20:46.711 --> 20:49.294
I don't know, baby,
I just ain't that guy.

20:49.377 --> 20:52.460
You weren't
a front office guy,
either. Now you are.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.127
It's time
to rep the Greane family.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.252
Show the world
who Charles Greane can be.

20:56.335 --> 20:59.210
Now, I know
it's not easy being Greane,
but you wanna play the part,

20:59.294 --> 21:01.918
you gotta act the part.
You feel me?

21:02.002 --> 21:03.544
Yeah, I feel you, baby.

21:03.627 --> 21:06.168
- I hear you.
- But do you see me?

21:06.252 --> 21:09.043
Well, I mean, I--
I see you, baby.

21:09.127 --> 21:10.544
And do you like what you see?

21:10.627 --> 21:12.502
- Hey, Andrew!
- Yes, sir.

21:12.586 --> 21:14.669
Go on ahead
and get up outta here, dawg.

21:14.752 --> 21:15.918
- You sure?
- Mmm.

21:16.002 --> 21:19.377
All right.
Have a good night, Charles.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.085
Mm-mm.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.294
( clicks tongue )

21:38.669 --> 21:39.877
( laughs )

21:39.960 --> 21:42.210
You really trying
to make an impression, huh?

21:42.294 --> 21:43.836
Well, I hope
you like apple pie.

21:43.918 --> 21:46.294
Hate that shit.
Mom's in the kitchen.

21:46.377 --> 21:48.460
Remember... ( whispers )
you ain't the first,

21:48.544 --> 21:50.544
and you won't be the last.

21:50.627 --> 21:53.168
I see you still carry
that chip on your shoulder

21:53.252 --> 21:55.210
even when you come home,
huh?

21:55.294 --> 21:57.544
When there's people
in my house I don't want to see.

21:57.627 --> 22:01.252
Well, it's just a dinner,
so lighten the fuck up.

22:01.335 --> 22:03.377
Jayda: Hey!

22:03.460 --> 22:07.002
- Hey. Perfect timing.
- Thanks. You too.

22:07.085 --> 22:08.419
Dinner's ready.

22:08.502 --> 22:10.627
- So, sit. Let's eat.
- Spencer: All right.

22:10.711 --> 22:13.043
Uh, that includes you, Q.

22:13.127 --> 22:14.836
Yep, let's eat.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.252
Can't wait.

22:17.335 --> 22:18.794
I can't eat another bite.

22:18.877 --> 22:20.918
That was amazing.
Thank you.

22:21.002 --> 22:24.168
I hope you don't mind.
I have a lot of homework
to do, so I'm just gonna...

22:24.252 --> 22:27.043
I have a better idea.
How about the two of you
chop it up

22:27.127 --> 22:29.460
while I go get dessert ready?

22:31.794 --> 22:34.669
- ( sighs ) Thanks, babe.
- You're welcome, babe.

22:36.127 --> 22:38.168
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.752 --> 22:44.419
So why don't you
save us a bunch of time
and bullshit

22:44.502 --> 22:47.085
so you can get back
to your... pie.

22:47.168 --> 22:49.210
We conversing
'cause you're dating my moms,

22:49.294 --> 22:51.252
or are you just another
straight-up hustler?

22:51.335 --> 22:52.877
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.335
You gonna put me
on a Wheaties box?

22:54.419 --> 22:56.127
Show me how to do it
the right way?

22:56.210 --> 22:58.127
It's a little too late
for that, isn't it, Q?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.627
What's that
supposed to mean?

22:59.711 --> 23:02.960
Well, I saw your
$150,000 G-Wagen

23:03.043 --> 23:05.168
that's parked down the street
at your neighbor's.

23:05.252 --> 23:07.918
That's a really smart,
elaborate ruse.

23:08.002 --> 23:09.335
( both chuckle )

23:09.419 --> 23:13.168
So I would say that
you are dirty as fuck.

23:13.252 --> 23:14.960
Yeah? What else?

23:15.043 --> 23:16.711
And that discretion
ain't your thing.

23:16.794 --> 23:19.294
- You gonna roll on me?
- No. That's not my style.

23:19.377 --> 23:22.168
- Then what is  your style?
- Teaching you
how to be discreet.

23:22.252 --> 23:24.960
About wearing a nice suit
and some Italian monk straps?

23:25.043 --> 23:26.502
That doesn't seem
very discreet to me.

23:26.586 --> 23:28.294
It's not supposed to be.

23:28.377 --> 23:30.960
I don't want to fuck around.
I'm here to do business.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.252
If you're gonna
jeopardize your eligibility,

23:33.335 --> 23:34.877
at least make it
worth something--

23:34.960 --> 23:37.502
not a $150,000 Mercedes.

23:37.586 --> 23:40.752
You finally
got my attention.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.544
Don't lose it.

23:42.627 --> 23:45.127
How would you like
to own a piece of
a regional sports network?

23:45.210 --> 23:48.752
It is an asset that
has a chance to be worth
a half a billion dollars.

23:52.168 --> 23:55.918
I knew you were a hustler.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.419
Jayda:
Who wants pie?

24:00.460 --> 24:01.836
I'm in.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.918
Never pass up a chance
to grab a slice.

24:05.752 --> 24:06.960
Me neither.

24:17.918 --> 24:18.877
Joe: Hey.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.877
When you sneak back
into the house,

24:21.960 --> 24:24.043
you're supposed
to do it barefoot,
dum-dum.

24:24.127 --> 24:25.877
You know that?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.043
( both laugh )

24:28.127 --> 24:30.127
Where the fuck
have you been, huh?

24:30.210 --> 24:33.294
You been makin' deals
or makin' love?

24:34.544 --> 24:37.043
- Hit me, Donny.
- You got it.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.210
I'm sorry about
not calling you back
earlier, man,

24:39.294 --> 24:40.877
I just had
a crazy-long day.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.544
But believe it or not,
I been workin' for us.

24:44.627 --> 24:47.419
- Good. Me too.
- Yeah? Anything good?

24:47.502 --> 24:49.627
I met with Lance today.

24:49.711 --> 24:51.711
Don't say anything,
let me finish.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.168
He's willing
to buy back the company

24:54.252 --> 24:57.502
at a respectable
75 cents on the dollar.

24:57.586 --> 24:59.918
We will take a big hit,
sure,

25:00.002 --> 25:02.377
but we'll eventually recover.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.168
And we'll just chalk it up
to a failed experiment--

25:05.252 --> 25:08.419
which is on me--
it's on me.

25:08.502 --> 25:11.752
And I really appreciate
you backing me up
this whole time.

25:11.836 --> 25:15.335
But, come on, it's time
to pull the ripcord

25:15.419 --> 25:17.711
and parachute back
to our oasis

25:17.794 --> 25:21.960
with most of our company
and self-esteem still intact.

25:22.043 --> 25:23.460
( sighs )

25:24.669 --> 25:26.210
So what do you say?

25:26.294 --> 25:28.252
I don't know whether
I should be appreciative
right now

25:28.335 --> 25:30.252
or call you out
for being a fuckin' pussy.

25:30.335 --> 25:32.460
- Oh, fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you.

25:32.544 --> 25:34.419
Is that what you want to do,
you wanna sell Sports X back,

25:34.502 --> 25:37.210
at a $12 million loss,
to that fuckin' dick-bag,

25:37.294 --> 25:39.419
or  do you want to dig in
and grind it out

25:39.502 --> 25:41.002
to be what you imagined
it could be?

25:41.085 --> 25:44.335
Well, of course  I want
to dig in and grind it out--

25:44.419 --> 25:46.210
