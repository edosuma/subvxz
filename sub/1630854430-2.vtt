Dwight "The General" Manfredi.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.115
Tulsa, I want you
to go there.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.449
Are you serious?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.185
After everything
I've done for this family.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.187
You don't understand
how this fucking works.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.589
I don't understand?

00:21.589 --> 00:24.692
But I'm gonna overlook this
for old time's sake.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.760
You'll kick up five grand
a week to start.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.330
Name's Tyson.
Welcome to Tulsa.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.798
Where to?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.500
This is how
it's gonna work--

00:32.500 --> 00:34.568
you make the money
and I make sure you keep it.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.937
- Do I have a choice?
- Absolutely not.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.107
You drive for me now.

00:39.107 --> 00:42.042
My gangsta, ha-ha!

00:43.277 --> 00:45.413
- I'm Mitch, by the way.
- Dwight.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.814
We're gonna invite you
to the party.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.982
I wouldn't really
call that a party.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.151
What do you call a party?

00:53.821 --> 00:56.724
- I had a good time.
- Maybe I'll see you around.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.692
A high-ranking Mafia capo
who has decided

00:58.692 --> 01:00.161
to grace Tulsa
with his presence.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.695
Oh, fuck me.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.056
There you are.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.993
- How you doing?
- Good.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.929
I need to send this
to New York overnight.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.831
And any perishables,
lithium batteries,

02:10.831 --> 02:12.566
flammable liquids or firearms?

02:12.566 --> 02:15.035
In the box?
Nah.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.538
Looks like it'll be $28.32.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.540
- Visa or Mastercard?
- Cash.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.342
- Oh.
- Oh?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.711
Yeah, we don't accept
cash anymore.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.646
You know, not for nothing,

02:25.646 --> 02:28.382
and I know
you don't make the rules--

02:28.382 --> 02:32.119
what the fuck is going on
with the world, huh?

02:32.220 --> 02:35.122
Cash is king.
You ever hear that expression?

02:35.223 --> 02:38.226
- No, I'm sorry.
- It's a great expression.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.100
Excuse me, sir,
I forgot my credit cards

02:47.235 --> 02:49.036
back at the hotel,
and I was wondering,

02:49.036 --> 02:53.140
if I give you cash,
could you put it on your card?

02:53.241 --> 02:55.343
Sure.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.645
You're a freaking hero.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.583
Dwight?
Double espresso?

04:15.323 --> 04:18.426
Young lady, do you have
a glass coffee cup?

04:19.226 --> 04:21.862
Super cool you're green,
but we don't use glass anymore.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.797
So, no real cups no more?

04:23.797 --> 04:25.399
Sorry.

Dwight David Manfredi.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.040
Born Brooklyn, New York,
July 1947.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.343
<i>Long-time member
of Cosa nostra,</i>

04:35.343 --> 04:37.010
<i>first-generation American,</i>

04:37.010 --> 04:39.647
<i>dad was a barber,
mom, a homemaker.</i>

04:39.647 --> 04:44.051
- Any kids?
- Daughter Cristina, early 30s.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.920
<i>- Nothing on the ex-wife.</i>
- Okay.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.589
Can I ask
what you need this for?

04:48.589 --> 04:52.225
We got a tip that he's in town,
so, you know, following up.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.395
<i>- Honey, please.</i>
- What?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.364
How long do we know each other?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.932
He bought me a drink.
Nothing happened.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.469
<i>- He bought you a drink?</i>
- Yeah.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.237
I got a rap sheet in front of me
goes back to before the Beatles,

05:04.372 --> 05:06.039
including two murders.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.976
I just said
nothing happened, okay?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.378
Who'd he kill?

05:10.378 --> 05:14.214
First, a guy named
Richard McLeevy, aka Ripple.

05:14.214 --> 05:17.217
<i>Second, a self-defense
in prison.</i>

05:17.217 --> 05:19.487
- Huh.
<i>- What?</i>

05:19.487 --> 05:21.755
<i>They tried to flip him
six different times.</i>

05:21.755 --> 05:24.425
<i>Did a 25-year stretch
rather than talk.</i>

05:24.425 --> 05:26.159
Well, you gotta
admire that, right?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.095
Do you?
He's a fucking gangster.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.764
I'm just saying, at least
he's got some integrity.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.833
Nothing sexier
than a cold-blooded killer

05:32.833 --> 05:35.068
with principles.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.470
I'll see you next time
I'm in town.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.406
Thank you.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.784
<i>Wait.</i>

05:52.486 --> 05:53.421
<i>Wait.</i>

06:16.810 --> 06:20.213
Can you believe that?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.358
Center of the universe!

06:32.793 --> 06:34.227
Is that what this is?

06:34.227 --> 06:37.264
Not really, it's just
what they call it.

06:37.264 --> 06:40.200
- Oh.
- You stand in that circle,

06:40.200 --> 06:43.971
and nobody outside it
can hear a sound.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.973
- No shit?
- Try it.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.508
What do I say?

06:47.508 --> 06:50.544
It won't matter, I won't be able
to hear you anyway.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.779
All right.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.663
Horse.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.405
Hey, did you hear that?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.578
Did you hear that?

07:24.578 --> 07:28.248
I told you,
nobody can hear anything.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.518
People talk to God in there.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.722
Hold up.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.924
Here you go.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.091
What's that?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.528
Get yourself
something good to eat.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.363
I don't want any
of your scuzzy money.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.307
So, how goes the battle?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.977
Good days, bad days.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.779
How's the drinking?

07:58.779 --> 08:02.983
Really good.
I think I am nailing that.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.652
Edward?

08:04.652 --> 08:07.254
- You guys talking?
- Not much.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.859
He's... he's dating a lady.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.295
How 'bout you?

08:15.295 --> 08:17.464
Been over a year.
You're entitled.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.934
I wouldn't say that
I'm dating anyone.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.036
Slept with someone?

08:23.036 --> 08:25.906
Yep.
I did.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.576
- What was he like?
- Old.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.044
- How old?
- Really fucking old.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.847
Like, he's 75.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.484
And he's also a criminal.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.920
Are you planning
on seeing him again?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.455
No.
I'm not.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.125
Okay. Good.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.972
There he is.
How you feeling?

08:58.972 --> 09:02.042
Fucking mandible's broke
in three places.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.778
- Sorry, bro.
- That's it?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.980
That's all you gotta say?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.349
What do you mean?

09:09.349 --> 09:12.052
I'm a made fucking guy,
that's what I mean!

09:12.052 --> 09:13.320
A fucking capo!

09:13.320 --> 09:14.955
What do you want me to do?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.790
- Fucking bullshit, Chickie!
- Hey.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.726
- This cock...
- Calm the fuck down.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.993
You're gonna get hurt.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.763
This fucking cocksucker
raised his hands.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.965
So, what do you wanna do?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.667
- You wanna kill the guy?
- Yeah.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.901
The fuck you think?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.705
My dad's friend, Vince.
You know that.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.273
And he's a capo too.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.709
Do we got rules
in this family or not?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.310
Of course we do.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.554
All right.
I'll talk to my father.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.090
Thank you.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.168
You getting in?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.403
You would think
for two grand a week,

10:03.403 --> 10:05.873
you'd get out and open the door.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.842
Seriously?
You want me to do that shit?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.177
No.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.612
But it would have been nice
if you offered.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.185
So, where to, boss?

10:18.185 --> 10:20.087
I need a credit card.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.789
Like a legal one,
or a fugazi?

10:21.789 --> 10:24.057
- No, legal.
- Well, you need to fill out

10:24.057 --> 10:25.793
an application and shit,
and show some income.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.795
Well, can't really do that,
can I?

10:27.795 --> 10:30.530
Well, you can get a debit card,
it's just as good.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.066
- How's that work?
- You go to the bank

10:33.066 --> 10:36.136
and you, uh...
fill out some paperwork,

10:36.136 --> 10:39.206
and deposit some cash,
and they give you a card.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.174
Well, there's the answer
to your question.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.845
- To what question?
- "Where to, boss?"

10:44.845 --> 10:47.247
Let's go see Bodhi
so I can get some cash.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.656
Oh, shit's fire.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.026
Ooh, that Grape Milkshake slaps.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.162
And buzzkill.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.802
The fact that it's barely
00 a.m.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.537
and you got a buzz to kill

11:10.537 --> 11:12.339
makes me question
your work ethic.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.876
I'm selling weed,
not operating a nuclear reactor.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.180
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.183
Second of all,
call me buzzkill again,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.152
I will rearrange your kidneys.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.220
- Yeah.
- I need some money.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.321
Uh-huh.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.024
Morning, Spooky.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.028
That's some real cornball stuff
right there, man.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.398
- What?
- The dreads.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.900
There's a lot
of cultural appropriation

11:39.900 --> 11:41.769
going on in here.

11:42.770 --> 11:46.506
So, at the risk of you
rearranging my internal organs

11:46.506 --> 11:49.209
or some other creative way
of inflicting pain,

11:49.209 --> 11:52.312
is there some sort of structure
to you taking my money?

11:52.312 --> 11:54.247
It's 20% a week.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.949
I'm sorry, what do I get
out of this?

11:55.949 --> 11:57.350
'Cause I'm still missing that.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.586
It's what you're not getting,
which is hosed.

11:59.586 --> 12:02.355
Speaking of which, I need
to talk to your supplier.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.124
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.559
- Why?
- So I can cut a better deal.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.163
And by the way, I got a line
on a new investment for us.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.165
We'll be making money
hand over fist,

12:12.165 --> 12:14.201
and the Feds
won't be able to touch it.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.370
When will all of this
start happening?

12:17.370 --> 12:21.041
You know, for a guy that's
stoned at 11:00 in the morning,

12:21.041 --> 12:24.144
you're pretty freaking impatient.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.820
Okay, and current address?

12:32.820 --> 12:34.421
Mayo Hotel.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.356
Do you have
a permanent residence?

12:36.356 --> 12:39.159
- Same place.
- And where's that located?

12:39.159 --> 12:42.830
- You're on.
- West-- West Fifth...

12:42.830 --> 12:44.331
115 West Fifth.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.266
Okay, I'll just need
to see some ID.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.704
New York.
I've been there once.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.073
Times Square.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.613
Do you happen
to have a passport?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.250
I haven't been doing
a lot of traveling lately.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.584
Is there a problem?

13:04.584 --> 13:07.220
I can't accept this.
It's expired.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.457
Look, I don't wanna
borrow your car.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.992
You asked for ID.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.695
I know, it's just,
it expired in 1998.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.103
This is why people
break the law,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.905
because they make
everything legitimate

13:24.905 --> 13:26.206
so freaking complicated.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.507
It ain't all that complicated,

13:27.507 --> 13:28.942
we just get you
a new license.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.410
You're such a good citizen.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.012
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.213
Why'd you go to jail?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.682
I didn't go to jail,
I went to prison.

13:35.682 --> 13:38.151
Jail's like a five-star resort
they put you in

13:38.151 --> 13:40.053
before they send you to prison.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.421
So, what'd you do?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.156
I tore the tongue
out of this guy

13:43.156 --> 13:45.492
who kept asking
so many stupid questions.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.627
It's a bit excessive,
don't you think?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.296
I'm impressed.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.509
Red Sox are even 6,
Yanks are 6 to 7.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.577
How 'bout the Braves?
- 9-11.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.646
- Put two on the Braves.
- You got it.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.381
I'll be back
tomorrow when I win.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.183
Yeah, I'll be waiting
right here.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.287
Manny?
Got a call.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.156
Oh, thanks, Roxy.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.398
This is Manny.
<i>[laughing]</i>

14:25.398 --> 14:27.267
<i>Manny's the name
for a Jew tailor.</i>

14:27.267 --> 14:28.735
What do you got
for me, Eddie?

14:28.735 --> 14:31.471
<i>You're right.
It's him.</i>

14:31.471 --> 14:33.941
<i>- It's Ike.</i>
- Fuck me.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.476
I knew it.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.946
- What's he doing here?
<i>- That, I don't know.</i>

14:38.946 --> 14:41.381
Oh, who am I kidding?
He's here to fucking kill me.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.483
<i>Maybe he's on vacation.</i>

14:43.483 --> 14:45.852
Yeah, yeah, and the Bahamas
were probably booked.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.254
Where's he staying?

14:47.254 --> 14:49.356
<i>How many nice hotels
you got down there?</i>

14:50.290 --> 14:52.092
I don't know, one?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.061
<i>Then maybe look there, stunad.</i>

14:54.061 --> 14:56.964
Fuck you.
And thanks.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.496
Face front, please.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.837
Sir, what are you doing?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.275
Next in line.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.877
Good afternoon.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.382
You're gonna need
to take a road test.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.551
I've been driving
since I was 13.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.220
Those are the rules.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.422
Next appointment is in...

15:55.422 --> 15:56.789
in five weeks.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.603
Well, this is strange.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.705
Looks like there's an opening
early next week.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.042
Mm.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.512
That's a learner's permit.
You can use that to practice.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.913
Is this good for ID?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.116
It's just like
a regular license.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.520
And we're all set.
I put a rush on it.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.955
You should receive
your new debit card

16:29.056 --> 16:31.058
within 24 to 48 hours.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.360
And if you need an extra card
for your...

16:34.594 --> 16:36.329
- Colleague.
- Colleague.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.697
One can never assume
these days.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.532
Assume all you want.
I work for him.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.201
- That's true.
- Well, thank you

16:41.201 --> 16:42.935
for choosing the Bank of Tulsa.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.072
Ow.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.943
Did he think we was...

16:51.078 --> 16:53.180
I think so.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.447
Yeah?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.083
How you doing, Chickie?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.585
<i>- How's Tulsa treating you?</i>
- Are you kidding me?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.687
It's like the Paris
of the Southwest.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.822
There you go,
that's the spirit.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.557
So, how's your old man?

17:04.557 --> 17:05.992
He's good,
he's here with me now.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.895
- Chickie, send him my love.
<i>- Yeah, of course.</i>

17:08.895 --> 17:10.630
<i>So listen,
I gotta talk to you.</i>

17:10.630 --> 17:12.099
That thing with Vince.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.334
- What thing?
<i>- Seriously?</i>

17:14.334 --> 17:15.902
You're gonna play
Mickey the Dunce?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.370
Let me tell you something, Chickie.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.706
If there was ever a guy
that had a crack in the jaw

17:19.706 --> 17:21.608
coming to him,
it was that kid.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.110
<i>Dwight, he's a made guy.</i>

17:23.110 --> 17:24.411
You made a beef.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.845
What's he want, a duel?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.914
Come on, we're rational people.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.816
That kinda shit
don't solve anything.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.784
<i>But you gotta make amends.</i>

17:31.784 --> 17:33.553
All right, I'll get him
a Get Well card.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.322
Dwight, I'm serious.
He's fucking pissed.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.723
<i>You gotta make this right.</i>

17:36.723 --> 17:38.525
And how do you suggest
I do that?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.127
100 grand would do it.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.895
- Are you kidding me?
<i>- Dwight, it's a tax.</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:45.465
His jaw's wired shut,
he can barely talk.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.134
Then you ought to be paying me.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.136
<i>You embarrassed him.
He's in pain.</i>

17:49.136 --> 17:50.970
Dwight, you gotta
make this go away.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.806
- And 100 grand will do that?
- Yes.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.842
All right,
I'll send him something.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.145
But if you hear it ticking,
don't open it.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.163
Hello?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.964
Okay, okay, okay.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.170
- Who is it?
- It's Stacy Beale.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.206
- Who?
- We met a few nights ago.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
No.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.243
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.413
- How you doing?
- Do people call you Dwight?

18:33.413 --> 18:34.981
Is that what I should call you?

18:34.981 --> 18:37.384
Sure.
Do you wanna come in?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.885
Sure.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.220
Really good seeing you.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.790
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- Sure.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.692
I'm an ATF agent.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.528
I should have told you
the other night,

18:48.528 --> 18:50.697
but it didn't come up.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.370
You know,
when high-level felons relocate,

18:57.370 --> 18:59.206
the FBI sends out a bulletin.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.208
Your picture came
through my office.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.810
- I'm an ex-felon.
- Great.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.382
What's an ex-felon,
former Mafia capo

19:09.382 --> 19:10.750
doing in Tulsa?

19:10.750 --> 19:15.121
Maybe if you're here
in your official capacity,

19:15.222 --> 19:17.457
maybe it's none
of your business.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.026
What does your family think
about you being here?

19:20.026 --> 19:22.262
I'm an ex-felon, how many times
do I have to say it?

19:22.262 --> 19:24.831
No, not your mob family.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.834
Your real family.
Your daughter.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.521
I haven't seen
my daughter Tina--

19:48.521 --> 19:51.524
that's her name, but I'm sure
you already know that.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.595
I haven't seen her
or the rest of my relatives

19:55.595 --> 19:57.264
in 18 years.

19:59.266 --> 20:02.134
It was hard for her
to see me all locked up.

20:02.134 --> 20:07.474
She was only a kid, so I said,
don't come back no more.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.542
Save her the pain.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.346
So basically, there's nothing
left for me in New York.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.948
So, you just decided
to move to Tulsa?

20:17.183 --> 20:18.251
Why not?

20:22.789 --> 20:26.158
Listen, I need you to know
that if you get jammed up here,

20:26.158 --> 20:28.461
there's nothing I can do
to help you out.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.463
I don't expect you to.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.369
We done, Stacy Beale?

20:49.181 --> 20:51.050
You know, John Lewis
didn't get his head broke

20:51.050 --> 20:52.485
on the Edmund Pettus Bridge

20:52.485 --> 20:55.121
so you could spit-shine
some gangster's Lincoln.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.623
Oh, you right about that.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.691
He did it so you can unplug
them white folks' toilets.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.992
Hey.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.361
You better be smiling.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.229
When I was your age,
I had mouths to feed.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.565
I know, Dad, I'm just--
I'm just kidding.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.437
You should be in college.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.373
Come on, Dad, we gonna do this
this early in the morning?

21:13.373 --> 21:16.075
Dude a businessman, you know,
I can learn a lot from him.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.841
Larry!

21:48.841 --> 21:50.410
What the hell, man?

21:50.410 --> 21:52.178
Your dog crapped
on my lawn.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.746
How do you know it was my dog?

21:53.746 --> 21:56.182
Because I just saw him.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.385
Good for the grass. Fertilizer.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.721
Well, let him
fertilize your grass, huh?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.591
That's it?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.834
So, what's this guy's
name again?

22:14.834 --> 22:17.269
Jimmy.
Creek Indian.

22:17.404 --> 22:20.106
Jimmy the Creek?
That's rich.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.174
Wait till you meet
his cousin Bad Face.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.411
Speaking of members
of the Tribe,

22:24.411 --> 22:26.846
I read the name
on your grower's license.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.215
Lawrence Geigerman?

22:29.215 --> 22:30.583
That's your name?

22:30.583 --> 22:32.752
Are we on some
anti-Semitic tip now?

22:32.752 --> 22:35.488
No, come on, I love the Jews.
I love Jewish food.

22:35.488 --> 22:40.827
So, what's with this Buddhist
Bodhi bullshit nickname?

22:40.827 --> 22:42.929
Come on, you never had a handle
in your line of work?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.330
Mm.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.732
What did they used
to call you?

22:45.732 --> 22:48.334
I was named after
General Dwight Eisenhower,

22:48.435 --> 22:50.870
so they called me
<i>Cinque Stelle.</i>

22:50.870 --> 22:52.639
Five Star.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.019
Bodhi, where the hell are we?

23:07.019 --> 23:08.655
Sorry for the inconvenience,

23:08.655 --> 23:11.157
but no one puts
a 100-acre grow

23:11.157 --> 23:13.860
and a shatter lab
on the side of U.S. 85.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.243
Smells good.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.489
How you doing?
I'm Dwight.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.759
This is Jimmy's cousin,
Bad Face.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.263
This a staring contest?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.965
You got a last name, <i>wasicu?</i>

23:54.967 --> 23:56.368
What's that mean?

23:56.503 --> 24:01.007
Literal translation
is a greedy non-Indian person

24:01.007 --> 24:03.109
who steals the fat.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.911
That's a first.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.513
You got a last name?

24:06.513 --> 24:08.548
You got a problem?

24:08.548 --> 24:10.783
I got serious problems, motherfucker.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.219
Okay, so we got off
to a really bad start here,

24:13.219 --> 24:15.321
but I think we can
turn this around.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.423
You ever been on a horse?

24:17.524 --> 24:19.859
You ever been
on life support?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.528
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:21.528 --> 24:22.829
Hey, take it easy, guys,
come on!

24:22.829 --> 24:25.565
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Easy, easy now.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.539
Nothing a little bit
of the fine Chiba won't fix.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.544
You don't even
need a sauna suit.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.946
Maybe I went to hell
and I don't even know it.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.213
Help yourself.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.115
I negotiate
with a clear head.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.450
I'll stick with this.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.819
There'll be no negotiating.

24:50.122 --> 24:53.560
It's $1,200 a unit for the buds

24:53.560 --> 24:55.562
based on a 10-unit order.

24:55.562 --> 24:59.098
Let's go.
There's other weed farms.

24:59.098 --> 25:04.571
And... I'll throw in a case each
of CBD Doggie Droppers

25:04.571 --> 25:07.006
and Rapture Patch
personal lubricant.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.407
Lubricant?

25:11.077 --> 25:13.412
You gotta do better
on the price, Jimmy.

25:13.412 --> 25:16.182
But for the glut, you're gonna
be paying over a deuce.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.652
You won't do better than $1,200
unless you're into DEPs.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.689
Light-deprived,
forced ripe.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.859
So, how many units you want?

25:26.859 --> 25:29.596
I'll ask the questions,
if you don't mind.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.765
This is delicious, by the way.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.402
So, is your operation
vertically integrated?

25:36.402 --> 25:38.070
You're a cultivator.

25:38.070 --> 25:43.342
You got DEPs, BHO, CRC,
blast concentrate.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.945
I know a trans-shipment station
when I see one.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.448
So, what do you got here?

25:49.448 --> 25:51.951
500 acres?
Maybe more?

25:51.951 --> 25:54.987
Probably see this place
from the fucking moon.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.322
It's big.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.290
Big enough that you wanna
sell me bruised fruit

25:58.290 --> 26:00.627
from your bumper crop,
and I'm supposed to be touched

26:00.627 --> 26:02.161
by your generosity?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.397
I'll take 300 units.

26:05.397 --> 26:09.435
$1,200 for the first 10 units,
$1,100 for the next 10,

26:09.435 --> 26:11.671
$1,000 for the 10 after that,

26:11.671 --> 26:16.743
and $750 each
for the remaining 270 units.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.645
I'll have to do the math.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.947
Well, do it fast
because the offer expires

26:20.947 --> 26:22.949
when I swallow this cracker.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.223
You drive a hard bargain.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.660
- But fair.
- Deal.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.366
When are we gonna
smoke the peace pipe?

26:40.366 --> 26:42.101
- Do we need to?
- Yeah.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.503
Me and Fuck Face
got off to a bad start.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.273
Bad Face.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.208
And I'm sorry about that.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.878
You kidding?
I could use 10 like him.

26:55.715 --> 26:59.585
Mm, and...
I should probably tell you...

27:00.787 --> 27:02.454
that apricot preserve
you're eating?

27:02.454 --> 27:03.923
Perfecto.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.292
It's infused with THC.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.395
How infused?

27:11.563 --> 27:13.199
Heavily, man.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.369
It's a weed farm.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.712
I was wondering why
I was feeling so good.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.948
Gee.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.150
- Let me try one of these.
- Hey.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.251
Damn.

27:46.465 --> 27:47.800
Hey, Dwight, you feeling it?

27:49.736 --> 27:51.137
There's a possibility.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.942
Want some?
No.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.343
- Okay.
- Want some?

27:58.610 --> 28:00.412
Here. Beep.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.917
Are you just gonna
pull it away again?

28:04.917 --> 28:07.653
No, of course not.
Trust me.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.321
- Yeah.
- Boop.

28:13.625 --> 28:14.827
Okay.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.331
I want you to get
a little nuts too.

28:23.402 --> 28:28.140
You know, I feel like
Rip Van Winkle.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.376
You wake up after 25 years,

28:30.376 --> 28:34.814
GM has gone electric,
Dylan's gone public,

28:34.814 --> 28:37.283
a phone is a camera.

28:38.584 --> 28:41.153
Coffee, five bucks a cup!

28:41.153 --> 28:43.689
And the Stones,
bless their heart,

28:43.790 --> 28:45.391
- they're still on tour.
- Word?

28:45.391 --> 28:49.095
Now that, that's music.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.963
Turn it up.
Turn it up.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.802
- Turn it up, Bodhi.
- I understand,

28:55.802 --> 28:57.536
but I don't have control
over that.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.940
- Turning your brain up.
- That won't do it.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.276
Let me ask you guys something.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.979
Seriously, I mean, seriously...

29:08.280 --> 29:09.816
what's going on
with this country

29:09.816 --> 29:11.383
in general nowadays?

29:11.383 --> 29:14.921
I mean, like, your generation,
seriously, come on.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.255
And these pronouns,

29:16.255 --> 29:18.424
what the fuck
is with the pronouns?

29:18.424 --> 29:23.896
He, she, him, they,
the, boom, bang, ba, fa, foo.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.933
You know what my pronoun is?
Guess.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.968
- Uh...
- Time's up. "It."

29:28.968 --> 29:33.439
As in, it can't take
this shit anymore.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.343
I'm all for change, I am.
I really am.

29:37.343 --> 29:40.512
But somebody keeps
moving the goalposts.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.049
When I was a kid,
in my neighborhood,

29:43.049 --> 29:45.217
at least I knew who I was.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.519
Or I thought I did.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.556
But truthfully,
nobody knows nothing.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.892
You had any brothers
in your neighborhood, OG?

29:52.892 --> 29:54.326
I'm not done.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.362
Did you ever hear of
Arthur Miller, the playwright?

29:56.362 --> 29:58.865
Of course, you haven't,
what am I doing?

29:58.865 --> 30:02.334
Arthur Miller wrote a play
about my neighborhood

30:02.334 --> 30:04.136
called "View From the Bridge."

30:04.136 --> 30:06.305
Not Henry Miller.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.841
Henry Miller wrote
"Tropic of Cancer."

30:08.841 --> 30:11.243
Which was okay, not bad.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.213
But Arthur Miller,
who banged, whacked,

30:14.213 --> 30:17.416
tick-tapped, double-whap-packed
Marilyn Monroe,

30:17.416 --> 30:20.252
and married her, and won
the freaking Pulitzer Prize.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.621
But in my opinion,
him getting to bang

30:22.621 --> 30:24.790
and sleep nightly
with Marilyn Monroe

30:24.790 --> 30:28.160
is by far his greatest triumph.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.498
Wow, this stuff is potent.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.437
<i>Mayo Hotel.</i>
- Yeah, hi.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.272
I'm looking for a friend,

31:13.272 --> 31:15.374
I believe he's staying
at your hotel.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.943
Name of the guest, please?

31:16.943 --> 31:18.344
Manfredi.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.113
Okay, just one sec.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.484
I'm sorry, sir, there's no one
here under that name.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.554
How 'bout an Ike?
You got an Ike?

31:28.554 --> 31:30.756
<i>- Is that a first name?</i>
- Dwight.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.358
Oh, Mr. Manse.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.426
<i>From New York, right?</i>

31:34.426 --> 31:37.563
Yeah, that-- that's right.
That's him.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.298
Okay, hold on.
I'll connect you.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.600
No, no, you know what?
Somebody just walked in.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.669
I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

31:43.669 --> 31:45.504
Sounds good.
Thank you, sir.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.173
Sure thing. Thanks.

32:27.213 --> 32:28.547
Sir?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.885
- This came for you.
- Oh, right.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.274
<i>Hello?</i>

33:28.274 --> 33:30.609
Hi, is Tina there?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.278
<i>Who's this?</i>

33:32.278 --> 33:34.080
- It's her father.
<i>- What?</i>

33:35.414 --> 33:39.118
It's Dwight Manfredi,
it's her father.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.853
Can I ask who this is?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.723
<i>I'm her husband, Emory.
Hold on.</i>

33:52.264 --> 33:55.467
<i>Listen, I'm sorry, but she--
she doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

33:56.635 --> 33:58.937
Are those your kids?
Yours and Tina's?

33:58.937 --> 34:00.472
<i>Guys, be quiet.
I'm on the phone.</i>

34:00.472 --> 34:01.840
<i>What's that?</i>

34:01.840 --> 34:05.977
Um, can you just tell her
I wanna hear her voice?

34:06.112 --> 34:07.146
<i>Hold on.</i>

34:09.615 --> 34:11.750
<i>Hello.
- Tina.</i>

34:11.750 --> 34:14.220
<i>- You wanted to hear my voice.</i>
- Yeah.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.921
<i>There.
You happy?</i>

34:15.921 --> 34:17.156
Can I see you?

34:40.612 --> 34:44.516
<i>Wait.
Wait.</i>

35:06.972 --> 35:09.175
I stopped seeing her...

35:10.876 --> 35:13.312
because it was too hard on her.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.285
No.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.353
I stopped seeing her...

35:23.088 --> 35:25.824
because it was too hard on me.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.033
I love you.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.304
I quit on you.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.941
And I'm sorry.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.812
I'm sorry.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.219
I'm sorry.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.935
- We made it.
- Got you some Barolo.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.438
We're on nitrous, dude!

36:13.572 --> 36:14.740
Man down.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.709
Where do you see me
in five years?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.711
You realize
I'm a criminal, right?

36:19.711 --> 36:20.912
I got a guru.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.381
I'm not here to get you killed.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.316
Down!

36:24.316 --> 36:26.418
Am I being charged
with almost getting shot?

36:26.418 --> 36:27.786
'Cause I don't think
that's a crime,

36:27.786 --> 36:29.154
even in Oklahoma.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.056
Somebody tried to kill me.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.525
Who might want you dead?
