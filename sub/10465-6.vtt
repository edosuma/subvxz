I'm telling you,
I've talked to the doctor.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.234
There is some depression
in your family, Gene.

09:08.968 --> 09:10.567
Really?

09:10.567 --> 09:11.801
Your mother
and her sister,

09:11.801 --> 09:13.067
well, they both had a problem.

09:13.067 --> 09:14.367
Do you mind?

09:14.367 --> 09:16.334
How about that?

09:16.334 --> 09:18.901
You don't think you could have
mentioned the family history?

09:18.901 --> 09:20.234
That's nothing to do with this.

09:20.234 --> 09:21.534
That's not what it sounds like.

is it making her any better?

just sitting there?

Gene, I am not having any luck.

from somebody on the street.

10:01.033 --> 10:04.200
Uh, one block east
and about 10 blocks south.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.767

has a doctor-- Dr. Leto.

in the glove compartment.

only the three of us.

and all this amazing
intellectual conversation.

that it might be weeks

the bathroom by herself again.

Oh, God, I'm sorry.

a total basket case.

a lot on your mind.

Yeah. Sarah, if you're
not feeling up to this--

11:40.334 --> 11:42.300
No. No. I mean,

that owes me an apology.

be big about the whole thing.

he doesn't even want to hear it.

Yeah. For my ticket home.

that I wouldn't go

13:03.868 --> 13:06.000

unless he pays for it.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.300
JULIA:
Yeah.

42:08.300 --> 42:10.234
I came back.

42:10.234 --> 42:13.000
For this?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.400
For you.

42:17.434 --> 42:18.834
Oh.

42:21.467 --> 42:24.100
Look, uh,

42:24.100 --> 42:27.267
I'm just gonna
go on upstairs.

42:27.267 --> 42:28.834
JULIA:
No.

42:28.834 --> 42:30.267
Don't do that.

42:30.267 --> 42:33.067
You're just gonna
feel alone upstairs,

42:33.067 --> 42:36.267
and you're not a-alone.

42:36.267 --> 42:40.734
I mean, you are in a way,
but you're also not.
