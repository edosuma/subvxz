05:56.726 --> 05:57.225

05:57.294 --> 05:57.725
SO THERE ARE A THOUSAND

05:57.794 --> 05:58.326

06:09.773 --> 06:11.105
THE HOLOCAUST.

06:11.174 --> 06:12.507

06:14.144 --> 06:14.609
MOST OF WHOM HAVE NOT BEEN

06:14.678 --> 06:16.978
RETURNED.

06:17.047 --> 06:17.678
IT WAS HIDEOUS AND IT WAS

06:17.747 --> 06:19.981
SICKENING.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.415
IN RESPONSE, ISRAEL LAUNCHED

06:27.724 --> 06:29.457
IN JUST THE FIRST SIX DAYS OF

06:29.526 --> 06:32.260
THE WAR, IT DROPPED 6,000 BOMBS

06:32.329 --> 06:34.529
ON A STRIP OF LAND JUST 25 MILES

06:34.598 --> 06:35.897
LONG, AND AT MOST 7 MILES WIDE.

06:35.966 --> 06:37.932

RECORD NUMBER THAT THE U.S.

06:39.436 --> 06:40.601
DROPPED ON AFGHANISTAN IN A

06:40.670 --> 06:42.537

06:42.606 --> 06:43.838
AS OF THIS TAPING, MORE THAN

06:43.907 --> 06:45.006
11,000 PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED,

06:45.075 --> 06:45.506
INCLUDING AT LEAST 4,000

06:45.575 --> 06:48.643
CHILDREN.

06:48.712 --> 06:49.210
THERE IS ALMOST NO PIECE OF

06:49.279 --> 06:55.650
FOOTAGE THAT I COULD SHOW YOU

06:55.719 --> 06:56.417
OF GAZA THAT IS NOT HORRIFYING

06:56.486 --> 06:56.818

06:56.887 --> 06:57.385
BUT WE DID FIND ONE PIECE OF

06:57.454 --> 06:58.019
FOOTAGE WHERE A CHILD VERY APTLY

06:58.088 --> 06:58.586
SUMS UP WHAT THINGS ARE LIKE

06:58.655 --> 06:59.320
THERE.

06:59.389 --> 06:59.921
>> HOW HAVE THE PAST FEW DAYS

06:59.990 --> 07:02.824
BEEN, ABDULAZIZ?

07:02.893 --> 07:04.525
>> LIKE SHIT.

07:04.594 --> 07:05.159
>> IT'S OKAY, WE CAN CUT IT OUT.

07:05.228 --> 07:06.461
TELL ME HOW HAVE THE PAST FEW

07:06.530 --> 07:08.729
DAYS BEEN, ABDULAZIZ?

07:08.798 --> 07:09.664
EXPLAIN TO US.

07:09.733 --> 07:10.198
>> YOU MEAN ABOUT THE WAR?

07:10.267 --> 07:11.699
>> YES.

07:11.768 --> 07:12.934
HOW HAS IT BEEN WITH THE WAR?

07:13.003 --> 07:14.535
>> LIKE SHIT!

07:14.604 --> 07:15.603
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE IT

07:15.672 --> 07:18.072
FEELS LIKE SHIT!

07:18.141 --> 07:19.107
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.

07:19.176 --> 07:21.742
AND I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

07:21.811 --> 07:23.077
I ALSO APPRECIATE HIM ASKING FOR

07:23.146 --> 07:23.711
CLARIFICATION WHEN THE REPORTER

07:23.780 --> 07:25.279
STARTED OVER.

07:25.348 --> 07:26.247
"SORRY, JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU'RE

07:26.316 --> 07:27.281
ASKING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE

07:27.350 --> 07:28.116
THROUGH THIS WAR, RIGHT?

07:28.185 --> 07:30.017
OKAY, GOT IT!

07:30.086 --> 07:31.052
MY ANSWER REMAINS -- LIKE SHIT!

07:31.121 --> 07:34.655
NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE."

07:34.724 --> 07:35.189
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, IT IS

07:35.258 --> 07:36.724
HARD TO SEE A KID LIKE THAT, AND

07:36.793 --> 07:37.325
THEN HEAR GLIB PRONOUNCEMENTS

07:37.394 --> 07:38.526
LIKE THIS ONE, FROM

07:38.595 --> 07:39.093
REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST OF

07:39.162 --> 07:40.728
FLORIDA.

07:40.797 --> 07:41.329
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE OTHER

07:41.398 --> 07:44.132
SIDE TO NOT SO LIGHTLY THROW

07:44.201 --> 07:45.666
AROUND THE IDEA OF INNOCENT

07:45.735 --> 07:46.234
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS, AS IS

07:46.303 --> 07:50.371
FREQUENTLY SAID.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.006
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD SO

07:52.075 --> 07:56.310
LIGHTLY THROW AROUND THE TERM

07:56.379 --> 07:56.944
"INNOCENT NAZI CIVILIANS" DURING

07:57.013 --> 07:57.278
WORLD WAR II.

07:57.347 --> 08:02.116
THERE'S NOT THIS FAR STRETCH TO

08:02.185 --> 08:06.387
SAY THERE ARE VERY FEW INNOCENT

08:06.456 --> 08:09.457
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS.

08:09.526 --> 08:10.057
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S NOT ONLY

08:10.126 --> 08:11.926
DISGUSTING, IT IS ALSO,

08:11.995 --> 08:13.594
EVIDENTLY THE SORT OF THING

08:13.663 --> 08:14.228
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH

08:14.297 --> 08:15.797
SAYING ON THE HOUSE FLOOR WITH

08:15.866 --> 08:16.998
ZERO REPERCUSSIONS, BECAUSE

08:17.067 --> 08:17.565
THAT'S APPARENTLY WHERE THE

08:17.634 --> 08:19.600
CONVERSATION IS RIGHT NOW.

08:19.669 --> 08:21.202
BUT JUST SO WE'RE VERY CLEAR,

08:21.271 --> 08:22.570
THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT

08:22.639 --> 08:24.472
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS, IN THE

08:24.541 --> 08:25.072
SAME WAY THERE ARE FLORIDIANS

08:25.141 --> 08:25.940
WHO AREN'T BRAINDEAD BIGOTS WITH

08:26.009 --> 08:28.609
A PENIS FOR A HEAD.

08:28.678 --> 08:29.343
A REGION'S WORST DOES NOT

08:29.412 --> 08:33.848
REPRESENT THEM ALL.

08:33.917 --> 08:34.482
AND LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO

08:34.551 --> 08:35.950
TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE

08:36.019 --> 08:38.519
MIDDLE EAST TONIGHT.

08:38.588 --> 08:39.253
AND I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING: BUT

08:39.322 --> 08:40.021
JOHN ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

08:40.090 --> 08:41.422
AREN'T YOU SCHOOL?"

08:41.491 --> 08:43.224
WELL, FUN FACT, I'M NOT!

08:43.293 --> 08:44.125
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT, I'M

08:44.194 --> 08:44.725
ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY A COMEDY

08:44.794 --> 08:45.359
SHOW, I JUST HIDE IT BETTER THAN

08:45.428 --> 08:47.094
MOST.

08:47.163 --> 08:47.728
SO I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE

08:47.797 --> 08:49.831
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF

08:49.900 --> 08:53.601
GENERATIONAL TRAUMAS INFORMING

08:53.670 --> 08:54.368
THE RESPONSE TO THIS, INCLUDING

08:54.437 --> 08:57.438
THE HOLOCAUST, AND THE NAKBA, OR

08:57.507 --> 08:58.005
MASS VIOLENT DISPLACEMENT OF

08:58.074 --> 08:58.606
PALESTINIANS, BEFORE AND AFTER

08:58.675 --> 08:59.006
ISRAEL'S FOUNDING.

08:59.075 --> 08:59.540
I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO DO A

08:59.609 --> 09:01.676
HISTORICAL BLOW-BY-BLOW OF HOW

09:01.745 --> 09:02.243
PALESTINIANS CAME TO LIVE IN

09:02.312 --> 09:02.910
GAZA AND THE WEST BANK RIGHT

09:02.979 --> 09:09.617
NOW.

09:09.686 --> 09:10.918
YOU CAN GOOGLE THAT FOR

09:10.987 --> 09:11.519
YOURSELVES -- OR EVEN BING IT!

09:11.588 --> 09:12.086
THAT'S COMPLETELY FINE, TOO!

09:12.155 --> 09:12.720
THOUGH I WILL SAY -- I WOULDN'T

09:12.789 --> 09:13.554
ASK JEEVES ABOUT THIS.

09:13.623 --> 09:14.188
HE HAS SOME UNEXPECTEDLY PRETTY

09:14.257 --> 09:18.092
NASTY VIEWS ON THIS.

09:18.161 --> 09:18.726
INSTEAD, I'D LIKE TO ZERO IN ON

09:18.795 --> 09:19.360
ONE OF THE BIGGEST

09:19.429 --> 09:20.495
MISCONCEPTIONS YOU MAY'VE BEEN

09:20.564 --> 09:25.032
HEARING OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

09:25.101 --> 09:25.633
SPECIFICALLY, THE TENDENCY TO

09:25.702 --> 09:28.202
COLLAPSE LEADERS AND CITIZENS

09:28.271 --> 09:29.170
WHEN DISCUSSING THIS.

09:29.239 --> 09:30.271
TO ASSUME THAT NETANYAHU SPEAKS

09:30.340 --> 09:30.905
FOR ALL ISRAELIS, OR THAT HAMAS

09:30.974 --> 09:32.406
SPEAKS FOR ALL PALESTINIANS.

09:32.475 --> 09:34.442
BECAUSE THAT IS EMPHATICALLY NOT

09:34.511 --> 09:35.910
THE CASE.

09:35.979 --> 09:38.513
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT HAMAS

09:38.582 --> 09:39.213
AND NETANYAHU -- HOW THEY CAME

09:39.282 --> 09:41.015
TO BE IN POWER, WHOSE INTERESTS

09:41.084 --> 09:42.049
THEY DO AND DON'T REPRESENT, AND

09:42.118 --> 09:43.618
WHAT ROLE THEY'VE PLAYED IN

09:43.687 --> 09:45.419
BRINGING US TO THIS CURRENT

09:45.488 --> 09:45.920
CONFLICT.

09:45.989 --> 09:47.655
AND LET'S START WITH HAMAS.

09:47.724 --> 09:48.756
IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE 1987, AND

09:48.825 --> 09:51.793
HAS GOVERNED GAZA FOR THE LAST

09:51.862 --> 09:52.426
17 YEARS.

09:52.495 --> 09:52.994
IT WAS FOUNDED, IN PART, IN

09:53.063 --> 09:59.066
OPPOSITION TO THE CORRUPTION OF

09:59.135 --> 09:59.700
WHERE PALESTINIAN POLITICS WERE

09:59.769 --> 10:00.334
HEADING AT THE TIME EMBRACING A

10:00.403 --> 10:00.935
PEACE PROCESS WITH ISRAEL, A

10:01.004 --> 10:04.038
PROCESS BY THE WAY THE

10:04.107 --> 10:04.672
PALESTINIANS HAD HIGH HOPES FOR

10:04.741 --> 10:11.741
WHEN IT STARTED.

10:12.115 --> 10:12.814
BUT HAMAS BRANDED ITSELF THE

10:12.883 --> 10:17.251
PARTY OF WRIST SINCE RESISTANCE.

10:17.320 --> 10:17.885
AND UNDERMINED THE PEACE PROCESS

10:17.954 --> 10:18.486
WITH A LONG SERIES OF ATTACKS

10:18.555 --> 10:18.953
AND SUICIDE BOMBINGS.

10:19.022 --> 10:19.587
HAMAS SEEMS TO BE VINDICATED IN

10:19.656 --> 10:20.188
ITS MESSAGING AND YOU CAN SEE

10:20.257 --> 10:20.721
THE PHILOSOPHY CONTINUING

10:20.790 --> 10:26.093
THROUGH TODAY.

10:26.162 --> 10:26.727
IT THEN UNDERMINED THAT PROCESS

10:26.796 --> 10:27.328
WITH A LONG SERIES OF ATTACKS

10:27.397 --> 10:27.795
AND SUICIDE BOMBINGS.

10:27.864 --> 10:28.362
THIS SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL,

10:28.431 --> 10:28.963
GHAZI HAMAD, RECENTLY DOUBLED

10:29.032 --> 10:29.597
DOWN ON THE MASSACRE OF OCTOBER

10:29.666 --> 10:30.164
7, BY SAYING "WE MUST TEACH

10:30.233 --> 10:32.066
ISRAEL A LESSON, AND WE WILL DO

10:32.135 --> 10:33.201
IT TWICE, AND THREE TIMES."

10:33.270 --> 10:35.036
AND FOR MANY COMMENTATORS, ALL

10:35.105 --> 10:36.704
THE CITIZENS OF GAZA ARE

10:36.773 --> 10:37.238
IMPLICATED IN THAT SORT OF

10:37.307 --> 10:38.906
RHETORIC, THANKS TO ONE KEY FACT

10:38.975 --> 10:41.909
YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME.

10:41.978 --> 10:42.443
>> THE PEOPLE OF GAZA, THE

10:42.512 --> 10:43.978
PALESTINIANS ELECTED HAMAS

10:44.047 --> 10:45.813
PEOPLE, HAMAS FIGHTERS, HAMAS

10:45.882 --> 10:47.048
TERRORISTS TO THEIR BOARD OF

10:47.117 --> 10:51.452
GOVERNORS.

10:51.521 --> 10:52.053
>> THE PEOPLE IN GAZA ELECTED

10:52.122 --> 10:52.253
HAMAS.

10:52.322 --> 10:54.622
IT'S A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,

10:54.691 --> 10:55.857
THAT IS THEIR GOVERNMENT.

10:55.926 --> 10:56.491
>> HOW DO YOU SAY HAMAS DOESN'T

10:56.560 --> 10:58.226
REPRESENT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE

10:58.295 --> 11:01.362
WHEN THEY VOTED HAMAS IN TO

11:01.431 --> 11:02.130
REPRESENT THEM?

11:02.199 --> 11:03.431
>> John: OKAY, SO VERY QUICKLY,

11:03.500 --> 11:04.332
THAT'S TUCKER CARLSON'S

11:04.401 --> 11:04.966
REPLACEMENT AT FOX,

11:05.035 --> 11:06.400
JESSE WATTERS.

11:06.469 --> 11:07.301
HE'S A LOT LIKE TUCKER, EXCEPT

11:07.370 --> 11:09.370
LESS CHARISMATIC, WAY DUMBER,

11:09.439 --> 11:11.305
AND WITH SOMEHOW EVEN MORE OF AN

11:11.374 --> 11:12.106
"I'VE KILLED SOMEONE DURING A

11:12.175 --> 11:13.841
FRATERNITY HAZING ACCIDENT"

11:13.910 --> 11:14.876
VIBE.

11:14.945 --> 11:15.343
WHICH IS REALLY SAYING

11:15.412 --> 11:17.979
SOMETHING.

11:18.048 --> 11:18.713
BECAUSE LOOK, IT'S TRUE THAT

11:18.782 --> 11:19.781
GAZANS DID, AT ONE POINT, ELECT

11:19.850 --> 11:20.648
HAMAS.

11:20.717 --> 11:22.750
BUT, IF YOU THINK THAT MAKES

11:22.819 --> 11:24.285
THEM ALL COMPLICIT IN WAR CRIMES

11:24.354 --> 11:26.721
THEIR GOVERNMENT COMMITS, THEN

11:26.790 --> 11:31.192
BOY DO I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU

11:31.261 --> 11:31.759
ABOUT WHAT THE U.S. FOREIGN

11:31.828 --> 11:33.928
POLICY.

11:33.997 --> 11:34.529
AND ALSO, THERE ARE SOME HUGE

11:34.598 --> 11:35.129
ASTERISKS ON "GAZANS ELECTING

11:35.198 --> 11:40.468
HAMAS."

11:40.537 --> 11:41.102
FIRST, THAT ELECTION HAPPENED IN

11:41.171 --> 11:41.736
2006, AND THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE

11:41.805 --> 11:41.936
SINCE.

11:42.005 --> 11:42.570
AND GIVEN THAT CHILDREN MAKE UP

11:42.639 --> 11:43.070
ROUGHLY HALF OF GAZA'S

11:43.139 --> 11:45.773
POPULATION, THAT MEANS MOST

11:45.842 --> 11:46.374
GAZANS WEREN'T EVEN BORN WHEN

11:46.443 --> 11:47.308
THE LAST ELECTION TOOK PLACE.

11:47.377 --> 11:48.910
WHAT'S MORE, HAMAS DIDN'T WIN A

11:48.979 --> 11:52.947
MAJORITY.

11:53.016 --> 11:53.448
IT ONLY WON WITH A BARE

11:53.517 --> 11:54.615
PLURALITY OF THE VOTES.

11:54.684 --> 11:55.416
AND IT DID SO BY RUNNING AGAINST

11:55.485 --> 11:56.050
FATAH, WHICH WAS WIDELY REVILED

11:56.119 --> 11:58.686
FOR INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION

11:58.755 --> 12:00.321
AT THE TIME.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.223
THOSE WERE THE KEY ISSUES IN

12:02.292 --> 12:02.757
THAT ELECTION.

12:02.826 --> 12:05.193
ALSO, HAMAS WENT OUT OF ITS WAY

12:05.262 --> 12:06.961
TO PRESENT ITSELF AS MORE

12:07.030 --> 12:07.562
MODERATE BACK THEN.

12:07.631 --> 12:08.162
IN FACT, HERE'S THE SAME HAMAS

12:08.231 --> 12:09.797
OFFICIAL WHO RECENTLY JUSTIFIED

12:09.866 --> 12:11.999
THE OCTOBER 7 ATTACKS -- SHORTLY

12:12.068 --> 12:13.401
BEFORE THAT 2006 ELECTION.

12:13.470 --> 12:16.804
>> WE ARE A MODERATE

12:16.873 --> 12:18.272
ORGANIZATION, REALLY.

12:18.341 --> 12:20.475
WE ARE NOT RADICAL ORGANIZATION,

12:20.544 --> 12:21.042
AND WE ARE NOT EXTREMIST OR

12:21.111 --> 12:22.810
FUNDAMENTALIST.

12:22.879 --> 12:23.344
NO, WE ARE AN OPEN-MINDED

12:23.413 --> 12:26.114
ORGANIZATION.

12:26.183 --> 12:27.014
WE BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY AND

12:27.083 --> 12:28.116
FREEDOM AND POLITICAL

12:28.185 --> 12:31.886
PLURALIZATION.

12:31.955 --> 12:32.954
>> John: YEAH, HAMAS REALLY

12:33.023 --> 12:34.388
TRIED TO REBRAND ITSELF.

12:34.457 --> 12:35.923
KIND OF LIKE DOMINO'S DID WHEN

12:35.992 --> 12:37.291
THEY RAN ADS ADMITTING THAT "THE

12:37.360 --> 12:39.060
SAUCE TASTES LIKE KETCHUP," "THE

12:39.129 --> 12:40.828
CRUST TASTES LIKE CARDBOARD,"

12:40.897 --> 12:42.864
AND THEY PROMISED TO "WORK DAYS,

12:42.933 --> 12:43.431
NIGHTS, AND WEEKENDS" TO GET

12:43.500 --> 12:44.165
BETTER.

12:44.234 --> 12:45.299
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE

12:45.368 --> 12:46.067
DOMINO'S, HAMAS IS A TERRIBLE

12:46.136 --> 12:47.769
ORGANIZATION THAT IN NO WAY KEPT

12:47.838 --> 12:51.139
ITS PROMISES.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.507
BECAUSE IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING,

12:52.576 --> 12:53.808
THAT TONE OF OPEN-MINDED FREEDOM

12:53.877 --> 12:56.778
CLEARLY FELL AWAY.

12:56.847 --> 12:57.345
NOT ONLY HAS THERE NOT BEEN

12:57.414 --> 12:57.979
ANOTHER ELECTION, MOST PEOPLE IN

12:58.048 --> 12:58.613
GAZA DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE

12:58.682 --> 13:02.183
FREEDOM TO SPEAK OPENLY.

13:02.252 --> 13:02.817
ONE POLL FOUND THAT, UNDER HAMAS

13:02.886 --> 13:03.718
RULE, 68% BELIEVED THAT THE

13:03.787 --> 13:05.353
RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A

13:05.422 --> 13:07.522
PEACEFUL PROTEST WAS NOT

13:07.591 --> 13:08.156
PROTECTED, OR WAS PROTECTED ONLY

13:08.225 --> 13:11.058
TO A LIMITED EXTENT.

13:11.127 --> 13:11.626
AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE

13:11.695 --> 13:14.328
SAID THAT HAMAS FORCES HAVE

13:14.397 --> 13:14.962
CARRIED OUT A BRUTAL CAMPAIGN OF

13:15.031 --> 13:15.897
ABDUCTIONS, TORTURE, AND

13:15.966 --> 13:17.131
UNLAWFUL KILLINGS AGAINST

13:17.200 --> 13:20.201
PALESTINIANS ACCUSED OF

13:20.270 --> 13:20.802
COLLABORATING WITH ISRAEL, AND

13:20.871 --> 13:22.970
HAVE ATTACKED MEMBERS AND

13:23.039 --> 13:23.604
SUPPORTERS OF FATAH, THEIR MAIN

13:23.673 --> 13:26.274
POLITICAL RIVAL.

13:26.343 --> 13:26.874
AND THE TRUTH IS, MANY GAZANS

13:26.943 --> 13:28.075
WILL SAY THEY DON'T WANT HAMAS

13:28.144 --> 13:28.910
IN CHARGE.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.545
POLLS SHOW IF TRUE PEACE WERE

13:30.614 --> 13:32.046
ACHIEVABLE, MANY PALESTINIANS

13:32.115 --> 13:34.682
WOULD EMBRACE IT.

13:34.751 --> 13:35.249
IN FACT, ONE CONDUCTED RIGHT

13:35.318 --> 13:38.152
BEFORE OCTOBER 7 FOUND 73%

13:38.221 --> 13:38.853
FAVORING A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT

13:38.922 --> 13:40.421
TO THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN

13:40.490 --> 13:42.490
CONFLICT.

13:42.559 --> 13:43.891
AND IT'S NOTABLE THAT IN JULY,

13:43.960 --> 13:44.525
DESPITE ALL THE RESTRICTIONS ON

13:44.594 --> 13:46.627
DISSENT IN GAZA, THERE WERE

13:46.696 --> 13:47.595
ACTUALLY PEOPLE ON THE STREETS

13:47.664 --> 13:49.330
CHANTING SLOGANS INCLUDING,

13:49.399 --> 13:49.931
"FUCK OFF, HAMAS" AND "WE WANT

13:50.000 --> 13:53.367
TO LIVE."

13:53.436 --> 13:53.968
AND LOOK, EVEN IF ALL

13:54.037 --> 13:56.471
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA DID SUPPORT

13:56.540 --> 13:58.339
HAMAS -- WHICH THEY DON'T -- THE

13:58.408 --> 13:58.973
RELENTLESS BOMBINGS OF CIVILIANS

13:59.042 --> 14:04.545
WOULD STILL BE ABHORRENT.

14:04.614 --> 14:05.146
COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT IS A WAR

14:05.215 --> 14:05.947
CRIME.

14:06.016 --> 14:07.715
BUT THE FACT IS, THERE IS MUCH

14:07.784 --> 14:08.349
MORE CRITICISM OF HAMAS IN GAZA

14:08.418 --> 14:11.219
THAN AMERICANS IN GENERAL, AND

14:11.288 --> 14:12.620
THESE DIPSHITS IN PARTICULAR,

14:12.689 --> 14:13.955
ARE WILLING TO ADMIT.

14:14.024 --> 14:15.356
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOT A

14:15.425 --> 14:16.791
MONOLITH.

14:16.860 --> 14:18.025
AND NOR, IMPORTANTLY, ARE

14:18.094 --> 14:19.427
ISRAELIS.

14:19.496 --> 14:20.628
BECAUSE NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT

14:20.697 --> 14:21.996
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, A MAN WHO

14:22.065 --> 14:24.499
HAS BEEN PRIME MINISTER OF

14:24.568 --> 14:25.299
ISRAEL FOR A COMBINED 16 YEARS,

14:25.368 --> 14:27.368
HERE IN THE U.S., DISCUSSION OF

14:27.437 --> 14:28.136
THE CURRENT CONFLICT SOMETIMES

14:28.205 --> 14:29.303
CONFLATES THE CURRENT ISRAELI

14:29.372 --> 14:30.571
GOVERNMENT WITH ISRAEL AS A

14:30.640 --> 14:31.572
WHOLE, AS IF THE TWO ARE

14:31.641 --> 14:33.040
ENTIRELY REPRESENTATIVE OF EACH

14:33.109 --> 14:34.475
OTHER.

14:34.544 --> 14:36.377
YOU'LL HEAR, "WE NEED TO SUPPORT

14:36.446 --> 14:38.179
BIBI AND ISRAEL" OR "THIS IS NOT

14:38.248 --> 14:42.216
A TIME TO CRITICIZE NETANYAHU."

14:42.285 --> 14:43.518
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITHIN

14:43.587 --> 14:46.587
ISRAEL.

14:46.656 --> 14:48.656
CRITICISM OF NETANYAHU THERE IS

14:48.725 --> 14:49.090
FIERCE.

14:49.159 --> 14:52.393
ONE POLL SHOW THAT 76% OF

14:52.462 --> 14:53.027
ISRAELIS WANT HIM GONE, AND MANY

14:53.096 --> 14:53.561
BLAME HIM FOR THE SECURITY

14:53.630 --> 14:54.061
LAPSES THAT LED TO THE

14:54.130 --> 14:55.263
OCTOBER 7TH ATTACK.

14:55.332 --> 14:56.898
AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT

14:56.967 --> 14:58.766
ATTACK, VIDEOS WENT VIRAL OF

14:58.835 --> 14:59.367
NETANYAHU MINISTERS VISITING

14:59.436 --> 15:02.503
HOSPITALS WHERE SOME OF THE

15:02.572 --> 15:03.104
VICTIMS WERE RECUPERATING, AND

15:03.173 --> 15:03.471
BEING YELLED AT.

15:03.540 --> 15:04.071
JUST WATCH THIS ONE MINISTER

15:04.140 --> 15:04.772
ESSENTIALLY GET CHASED OUT OF

15:04.841 --> 15:07.608
THE HOSPITAL, FIRST BY A FAMILY

15:07.677 --> 15:09.210
MEMBER, AND THEN BY SOMEBODY WHO

15:09.279 --> 15:14.449
WORKED THERE.

15:14.518 --> 15:15.450
>> [SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH

15:15.519 --> 15:22.519
LANGUAGE]

15:40.510 --> 15:41.976
>> John: THAT'S PRETTY INTENSE.

15:42.045 --> 15:44.178
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT

15:44.247 --> 15:44.812
MEDICINE, BUT AFTER SEEING THAT,

15:44.881 --> 15:45.513
I'M GOING TO ASSUME THE

15:45.582 --> 15:47.548
HIPPOCRATIC OATH ACTUALLY GOES,

15:47.617 --> 15:48.483
"FIRST DO NO HARM," AND SECOND

15:48.552 --> 15:50.084
"IF UNWELCOME GOVERNMENT

15:50.153 --> 15:50.685
OFFICIALS ARE UPSETTING PEOPLE

15:50.754 --> 15:51.519
IN YOUR HOSPITAL, KICK THEM THE

15:51.588 --> 15:56.691
FUCK OUT."

15:56.760 --> 15:57.258
BECAUSE HE'S CLAPPING AT HER

15:57.327 --> 15:58.392
THERE LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE

15:58.461 --> 15:59.026
TRYING TO GET A BIRD OUT OF YOUR

15:59.095 --> 16:01.362
HOUSE.

16:01.431 --> 16:01.863
AND WHILE THAT ANGER AT

16:01.932 --> 16:02.530
NETANYAHU HAS CERTAINLY

16:02.599 --> 16:04.232
INTENSIFIED SINCE OCTOBER 7,

16:04.301 --> 16:05.366
IT'S ALSO BEEN THERE FOR A LONG

16:05.435 --> 16:07.201
TIME.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.836
BEFORE THE ATTACK, ISRAEL SAW

16:08.905 --> 16:10.037
NEARLY 40 WEEKS OF PROTESTS,

16:10.106 --> 16:11.973
INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

16:12.042 --> 16:12.673
OF ISRAELIS MARCHING IN THE

16:12.742 --> 16:14.976
STREETS, IN OPPOSITION TO HIS

16:15.045 --> 16:15.610
PLAN THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY END

16:15.679 --> 16:17.044
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE

16:17.113 --> 16:17.745
JUDICIARY AND ENDANGER CIVIL

16:17.814 --> 16:19.914
RIGHTS.

16:19.983 --> 16:20.515
AND LOOK, NETANYAHU HAS ALWAYS

16:20.584 --> 16:22.784
BEEN A HARD-LINER.

16:22.853 --> 16:23.417
HE'S FORGED HIS ENTIRE POLITICAL

16:23.486 --> 16:24.752
PERSONA AROUND AN EXTREME

16:24.821 --> 16:25.920
VERSION OF "SAFETY THROUGH

16:25.989 --> 16:27.588
STRENGTH."

16:27.657 --> 16:28.222
WHICH HAS INCLUDED OPPOSITION TO

16:28.291 --> 16:30.291
THE PEACE PROCESS AT CRUCIAL

16:30.360 --> 16:32.360
POINTS.

16:32.429 --> 16:34.328
WHEN FORMER ISRAELI PRIME

16:34.397 --> 16:35.630
MINISTER YITZAK RABIN AGREED TO

16:35.699 --> 16:36.964
THE OSLO PEACE ACCORDS, WHICH

16:37.033 --> 16:39.801
ATTEMPTED TO SET A FRAMEWORK FOR

16:39.870 --> 16:40.401
AN EVENTUAL RESOLUTION OF THE

16:40.470 --> 16:42.470
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT,

16:42.539 --> 16:43.070
NETANYAHU WAS FIERCELY AGAINST

16:43.139 --> 16:44.472
IT.

16:44.541 --> 16:45.640
INFAMOUSLY SPEAKING AT A RALLY

16:45.709 --> 16:48.075
WHERE PROTESTORS CHANTED "IN

16:48.144 --> 16:50.611
BLOOD AND FIRE, WE WILL EXPEL

16:50.680 --> 16:51.078
RABIN," AND HELD ALOFT

16:51.147 --> 16:51.813
DEPICTIONS OF HIM IN A NAZI

16:51.882 --> 16:54.315
UNIFORM.

16:54.384 --> 16:54.849
SOON AFTER THAT, RABIN WAS

16:54.918 --> 16:57.185
KILLED BY A FAR-RIGHT ISRAELI

16:57.254 --> 16:58.219
EXTREMIST, AND RABIN'S WIDOW

16:58.288 --> 17:00.488
BLAMED NETANYAHU FOR STOKING THE

17:00.557 --> 17:03.291
FLAMES THAT LED TO THAT.

17:03.360 --> 17:03.791
AND IN THE WAKE OF THAT

17:03.860 --> 17:04.859
ASSASSINATION, NETANYAHU'S

17:04.928 --> 17:07.728
POLITICAL CAREER SEEMED DEAD.

17:07.797 --> 17:08.362
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL A SERIES OF

17:08.431 --> 17:10.665
BUS BOMBINGS BY HAMAS IN ISRAEL

17:10.734 --> 17:11.299
-- AS PART OF THEIR OWN EFFORTS

17:11.368 --> 17:18.368
TO DERAIL THE PEACE ACCORDS --

17:29.519 --> 17:30.084
THAT NETANYAHU WAS FIRST ELECTED

17:30.153 --> 17:30.451
PRIME MINISTER.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.052
AND HIS MESSAGE, "I'M THE ONLY

17:31.121 --> 17:31.652
ONE WHO CAN KEEP YOU SAFE" HAS

17:31.721 --> 17:32.220
BEEN CONSISTENT EVER SINCE.

17:32.289 --> 17:32.787
HERE HE IS IN THE RUN-UP TO

17:32.856 --> 17:33.421
ISRAEL'S 2014 ELECTION, MAKING

17:33.490 --> 17:33.821
THAT POINT AGAIN.

17:33.890 --> 17:34.422
>> I FEEL THE JEWISH NATION IS

17:34.491 --> 17:41.491
UNDER THREAT, AND I'M PREPARED

17:42.332 --> 17:42.763
TO MITIGATE THAT DANGER.

17:42.832 --> 17:43.364
IT'S WHAT THE STATE OF ISRAEL

17:43.433 --> 17:43.998
EXPECTS FROM ME, AND IT'S WHAT

17:44.067 --> 17:44.232
I'LL DO.

17:44.301 --> 17:44.899
>> John: THAT'S A BIG CLAIM THAT

17:44.968 --> 17:45.900
HASN'T JUST DATED VERY WELL.

17:45.969 --> 17:46.434
HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T SEEN A

17:46.503 --> 17:49.103
POLITICIAN'S WORDS AGE SO POORLY

17:49.172 --> 17:49.704
SINCE HILLARY CLINTON TWEETED

17:49.773 --> 17:56.773
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THIS FUTURE

17:56.780 --> 17:57.011
PRESIDENT."

17:57.080 --> 17:57.478
SO HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN

17:57.547 --> 17:57.779
HARD-RIGHT.

17:57.848 --> 17:58.379
BUT IT'S WORTH TAKING A MINUTE

17:58.448 --> 18:02.917
TO UNDERSCORE JUST HOW EXTREME

18:02.986 --> 18:03.451
HIS CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS.

18:03.520 --> 18:08.589
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, NETANYAHU

18:08.658 --> 18:09.157
HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO HOLD

18:09.226 --> 18:09.490
OFFICE THERE.

18:09.559 --> 18:10.057
AND ISRAEL HAD TO ENDURE TK

18:10.126 --> 18:10.658
ELECTIONS, BECAUSE NO ONE WAS

18:10.727 --> 18:11.159
ABLE TO FORM A MAJORITY.

18:11.228 --> 18:11.893
HE ONLY MADE IT BACK INTO POWER

18:11.962 --> 18:14.362
LAST YEAR, BY FORMING A

18:14.431 --> 18:14.929
COALITION WITH THOSE ON THE

18:14.998 --> 18:15.530
FURTHEST RIGHT WING OF ISRAELI

18:15.599 --> 18:16.164
POLITICS -- LEADING TO THE MOST

18:16.233 --> 18:16.731
RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT IN THE

18:16.800 --> 18:21.669
COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

18:21.738 --> 18:22.236
HIS CABINET IS STOCKED WITH

18:22.305 --> 18:22.537
EXTREMISTS.

18:22.606 --> 18:29.606
TAKE ITAMAR BEN-GVIR.

18:30.380 --> 18:30.945
HE'S BEEN CONVICTED ON AT LEAST

18:31.014 --> 18:31.446
EIGHT CHARGES, INCLUDING

18:31.515 --> 18:31.913
SUPPORTING A TERRORIST

18:31.982 --> 18:35.082
ORGANIZATION AND INCITEMENT TO

18:35.151 --> 18:35.550
RACISM.

18:35.619 --> 18:39.687
HE WAS ONCE CONSIDERED SO

18:39.756 --> 18:40.221
FRINGE, THIS ISRAELI ARMY

18:40.290 --> 18:43.257
REJECTED HIM FROM MANDATORY

18:43.326 --> 18:43.925
SERVICE.

18:43.994 --> 18:44.425
BUT HE'S NOW NETANYAHU'S

18:44.494 --> 18:45.026
MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

18:45.095 --> 18:49.597
MEANWHILE, HIS CURRENT FINANCE

18:49.666 --> 18:50.231
MINISTER, BEZALEL SMOTRICH, HAS

18:50.300 --> 18:50.832
SAID, "IS THERE A PALESTINIAN

18:50.901 --> 18:51.265
HISTORY OR CULTURE?

18:51.334 --> 18:51.599
THERE IS NONE.

18:51.668 --> 18:52.166
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A

18:52.235 --> 18:53.167
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE."

18:53.236 --> 18:53.801
HE'S ALSO ADVOCATED FOR "VICTORY

18:53.870 --> 18:56.270
THROUGH SETTLEMENT," BASICALLY

18:56.339 --> 18:56.871
SEIZING LAND IN THE WEST BANK,

18:56.940 --> 18:57.472
AND DRIVING PALESTINIANS FROM

18:57.541 --> 19:00.942
THEIR HOMES TO THE POINT WHERE,

19:01.011 --> 19:01.542
QUOTE, "I ABORT THEIR HOPES OF

19:01.611 --> 19:05.880
ESTABLISHING A STATE."

19:05.949 --> 19:06.481
SETTLEMENTS ARE WIDELY

19:06.550 --> 19:06.981
UNDERSTOOD TO BE AGAINST

19:07.050 --> 19:11.419
INTERNATIONAL LAW, YET SMOTRICH

19:11.488 --> 19:12.120
WANTS A MASSIVE EXPANSION OF

19:12.189 --> 19:13.354
THEM, AND NETANYHAU GAVE HIM A

19:13.423 --> 19:13.888
SPECIAL ROLE IN CHARGE OF

19:13.957 --> 19:17.492
SETTLEMENT AFFAIRS.

19:17.561 --> 19:18.126
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST SURPRISING

19:18.195 --> 19:18.726
WAY NETANYAHU HAS JEOPARDIZED

19:18.795 --> 19:21.295
ISRAEL'S SAFETY IS THAT, FOR

19:21.364 --> 19:21.863
YEARS, HE DELIBERATELY USED

19:21.932 --> 19:22.497
HAMAS AS A WAY TO UNDERMINE THE

19:22.566 --> 19:24.765
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, A RIVAL

19:24.834 --> 19:29.170
TO HAMAS, WHICH ADMINISTERS

19:29.239 --> 19:30.204
PARTS OF THE WEST BANK AND HAS

19:30.273 --> 19:30.772
MUCH MORE LEGITIMACY ON THE

19:30.841 --> 19:31.439
WORLD STAGE.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.374
EXPERTS SAY THE IDEA WAS

19:33.443 --> 19:34.008
BASICALLY DIVIDE AND CONQUER --

19:34.077 --> 19:37.378
IF PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP

19:37.447 --> 19:37.979
REMAINS SPLIT, AND ONE OF THE

19:38.048 --> 19:40.281
MAIN PARTIES AT THE TABLE HAS A

19:40.350 --> 19:40.848
TERRORISM LABEL ON IT, IT'S

19:40.917 --> 19:41.816
GOING TO BE MUCH EASIER FOR

19:41.885 --> 19:42.416
NETANYAHU TO REFUSE TO ENGAGE

19:42.485 --> 19:43.584
WITH THEM, AND SAY HE HAS "NO

19:43.653 --> 19:46.854
PARTNER FOR PEACE."

19:46.923 --> 19:47.488
HERE'S SMOTRICH EXPLAINING THAT

19:47.557 --> 19:51.592
STRATEGY OUT LOUD IN 2015.

19:51.661 --> 19:54.562
>> THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IS

19:54.631 --> 19:55.062
A BURDEN AND HAMAS IS A

19:55.131 --> 19:56.564
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT NO

19:56.633 --> 19:58.933
ONE WILL RECOGNIZE, AND NO ONE

19:59.002 --> 20:00.535
WILL GIVE IT STATUS IN THE ICC.

20:00.604 --> 20:01.736
NO ONE WILL LET THEM LEAD A

20:01.805 --> 20:02.537
DECISION IN THE SECURITY

20:02.606 --> 20:03.704
COUNCIL.

20:03.773 --> 20:06.474
THE MAIN PITCH WE ARE PLAYING

20:06.543 --> 20:06.908
NOW IS INTERNATIONAL

20:06.977 --> 20:07.708
DELEGITIMIZATION.

20:07.777 --> 20:08.676
HAMAS AT THIS POINT, IN MY

20:08.745 --> 20:11.145
OPINION, WILL BE AN ASSET.

20:11.214 --> 20:12.914
>> John: "HAMAS IS AN ASSET."

20:12.983 --> 20:14.615
IF YOU'RE CALLING THE GROUP THAT

20:14.684 --> 20:15.149
HAS REPEATEDLY KILLED YOUR

20:15.218 --> 20:18.352
PEOPLE AN ASSET, IT SHOWS PRETTY

20:18.421 --> 20:18.986
CLEARLY THAT WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT

20:19.055 --> 20:21.689
ISN'T SAFETY, BUT TOTAL CONTROL.

20:21.758 --> 20:22.223
AND FOR YEARS, NETANYAHU'S

20:22.292 --> 20:22.857
GOVERNMENT WAS ACTUALLY ALLOWING

20:22.926 --> 20:25.393
SUITCASES OF CASH TO BE

20:25.462 --> 20:26.527
DELIVERED TO HAMAS, SOMETHING BY

20:26.596 --> 20:31.332
THE WAY THAT EARNED SUITCASES OF

20:31.401 --> 20:31.899
CASH THE TITLE "MOST MORALLY

20:31.968 --> 20:32.500
DISREPUTABLE WAY TO TRANSFER

20:32.569 --> 20:33.100
MONEY" FOR THE NINE HUNDREDTH

20:33.169 --> 20:34.902
YEAR IN A ROW.

20:34.971 --> 20:35.603
WHEN THE SCANDAL BROKE,

20:35.672 --> 20:37.004
NETANYAHU INSISTED THAT THAT

20:37.073 --> 20:37.638
MONEY WAS FOR HUMANITARIAN AID.

20:37.707 --> 20:44.445
WHICH STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY

20:44.514 --> 20:44.979
IT HAD TO BE DELIVERED IN

20:45.048 --> 20:45.646
LUGGAGE IN THE BACK OF A FUCKING

20:45.715 --> 20:45.813
CAR.

20:45.882 --> 20:47.081
THE POINT IS, NETANYAHU TOOK THE

20:47.150 --> 20:48.516
RISK OF BETTING THAT HE COULD

20:48.585 --> 20:49.884
CONTROL HAMAS, AND USE THEM TO

20:49.953 --> 20:51.319
HIS OWN ENDS.

20:51.388 --> 20:52.753
AND HE WAS HORRIBLY WRONG ABOUT

20:52.822 --> 20:53.921
THAT, TO THE POINT THAT HIS

20:53.990 --> 20:54.822
MINISTERS ARE NOW GETTING

20:54.891 --> 20:56.824
SCREAMED OUT OF HOSPITALS.

20:56.893 --> 20:58.392
SO, TO RECAP SO FAR:

20:58.461 --> 20:59.560
PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS HAVE

20:59.629 --> 21:01.028
BOTH BEEN RELENTLESSLY LET DOWN

21:01.097 --> 21:03.397
BY THEIR LEADERS', AND THE

21:03.466 --> 21:04.665
RESULT HAS BEEN A DECADES-LONG

21:04.734 --> 21:06.300
CYCLE OF EXTREMISM, VIOLENCE,

21:06.369 --> 21:07.902
RETALIATION, AND MORE EXTREMISM.

21:07.971 --> 21:09.837
AND PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN ON

21:09.906 --> 21:10.638
THE RECEIVING END OF THAT

21:10.707 --> 21:12.507
EXTREMISM TWICE OVER -- SUBJECT

21:12.576 --> 21:14.242
TO THE INADEQUACIES AND

21:14.311 --> 21:16.744
CRUELTIES OF A HAMAS GOVERNMENT

21:16.813 --> 21:18.412
AND THE PUNISHING ISOLATION AND

21:18.481 --> 21:20.948
DAILY MISERY OF AN ISRAELI ONE.

21:21.017 --> 21:21.516
BECAUSE ISRAEL'S APPROACH TO

21:21.585 --> 21:23.785
GAZA HAS BEEN PUNISHING --

21:23.854 --> 21:25.520
FENCING PEOPLE IN, LIMITING

21:25.589 --> 21:26.954
EXITS, AND TRAPPING THEM INSIDE

21:27.023 --> 21:28.389
OF WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED AN

21:28.458 --> 21:28.990
OPEN-AIR PRISON BY MANY HUMAN

21:29.059 --> 21:32.293
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS.

21:32.362 --> 21:33.427
LIFE UNDER A BLOCKADE THERE HAS

21:33.496 --> 21:34.595
BEEN HARD FOR A LONG TIME, EVEN

21:34.664 --> 21:38.166
WHEN THERE AREN'T BOMBS FLYING.

21:38.235 --> 21:38.800
>> THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS JUST

21:38.869 --> 21:40.568
10% OF GAZA'S TWO MILLION PEOPLE

21:40.637 --> 21:43.571
HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING

21:43.640 --> 21:44.705
WATER.

21:44.774 --> 21:47.108
>> MY CHILDREN GET SICK BECAUSE

21:47.177 --> 21:49.644
OF THE WATER.

21:49.713 --> 21:50.411
THEY SUFFER FROM VOMITING,

21:50.480 --> 21:51.646
DIARRHEA.

21:51.715 --> 21:54.315
>> ALL THE STREETS ARE FULL OF

21:54.384 --> 21:54.849
TRASHES, ALL OF GARBAGE.

21:54.918 --> 21:55.416
ALL THE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE NO

21:55.485 --> 21:56.784
WORK.

21:56.853 --> 21:58.986
THEY HAVE NO EMPLOYMENT.

21:59.055 --> 22:01.255
>> WHEN PEOPLE HERE RUN OUT OF

22:01.324 --> 22:01.889
ELECTRICITY HERE, THEY ONLY GET

22:01.958 --> 22:03.157
THREE HOURS A DAY.

22:03.226 --> 22:05.193
THEY CAN EITHER BUY A SMALL

22:05.262 --> 22:06.928
BATTERY TO TRY TO OPERATE

22:06.997 --> 22:07.895
LIGHTS, OR THEY JUST GO OUTSIDE

22:07.964 --> 22:08.696
AND LIGHT FIRES.

22:08.765 --> 22:10.698
>> THIS LIFE HAS GIVEN IMAD,

22:10.767 --> 22:12.333
LIKE MANY GAZANS, A SENSE OF

22:12.402 --> 22:14.435
HAVING LITTLE TO LOSE.

22:14.504 --> 22:17.405
>> John: YEAH, YOU REALLY CAN'T

22:17.474 --> 22:18.739
BLAME THEM FOR FEELING THAT WAY.

22:18.808 --> 22:19.340
ONCE YOU'VE LOST CLEAN WATER,

22:19.409 --> 22:19.974
SANITARY SPACE, JOB PROSPECTS,

22:20.043 --> 22:20.575
AND MOST ELECTRICITY, THERE'S

22:20.644 --> 22:21.209
NOT REALLY MUCH LEFT TO LOSE BUT

22:21.278 --> 22:23.644
HOPE.

22:23.713 --> 22:27.515
AND IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT

22:27.584 --> 22:28.116
THERE IS ONE MORE MAJOR PLAYER

22:28.185 --> 22:29.617
IN ALL THIS THAT I HAVEN'T

22:29.686 --> 22:30.284
MENTIONED, AND IT'S US.

22:30.353 --> 22:32.186
AND I DON'T JUST MEAN THE

22:32.255 --> 22:33.321
BRITISH, WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY

22:33.390 --> 22:34.989
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THIS.

22:35.058 --> 22:36.224
I'M TALKING ABOUT AMERICA.

22:36.293 --> 22:37.625
BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY HAS

22:37.694 --> 22:40.361
EMPHATICALLY PICKED A SIDE.

22:40.430 --> 22:40.928
IN RECENT YEARS, WE'VE GIVEN

22:40.997 --> 22:42.897
ISRAEL $3.8 BILLION A YEAR IN

22:42.966 --> 22:43.965
MILITARY AID.

22:44.034 --> 22:45.066
AND YOU CAN MAKE GEOPOLITICAL

22:45.135 --> 22:46.033
ARGUMENTS FOR WHY THAT IS OR

22:46.102 --> 22:47.068
ISN'T A VALID THING TO DO.

22:47.137 --> 22:48.703
BUT IT MEANS WE ARE HEAVILY

22:48.772 --> 22:49.337
IMPLICATED IN EVERYTHING YOU'VE

22:49.406 --> 22:50.638
JUST SEEN.

22:50.707 --> 22:54.375
JUST LISTEN TO BASSAM ARAMIN, A

22:54.444 --> 22:55.676
PALESTINIAN WHOSE TEN-YEAR-OLD

22:55.745 --> 22:56.511
DAUGHTER WAS KILLED BY AN

22:56.580 --> 22:59.113
ISRAELI BORDER GUARD IN 2007.

22:59.182 --> 22:59.847
>> MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KILLED

22:59.916 --> 23:01.516
WITH AN AMERICAN RUBBER BULLET,

23:01.585 --> 23:02.984
UNFORTUNATELY, FROM AN AMERICAN

23:03.053 --> 23:06.220
M16, UNFORTUNATELY, FROM AN

23:06.289 --> 23:07.822
AMERICAN JEEP, AN AMERICAN

23:07.891 --> 23:08.389
UNIFORM, AND THE SOLDIER HAD

23:08.458 --> 23:12.160
TRAINED IN AMERICA.

23:12.229 --> 23:14.662
SO EVERYTHING IS AMERICAN.

23:14.731 --> 23:15.029
>> John: RIGHT.

23:15.098 --> 23:15.563
"EVERYTHING IS AMERICAN."

23:15.632 --> 23:16.197
AND I KNOW THAT'S HARD TO HEAR.

23:16.266 --> 23:21.269
BUT THE FACT IS, "MADE IN

23:21.338 --> 23:21.869
AMERICA" IS SOMETHING THAT WE

23:21.938 --> 23:23.004
UNDERSTANDABLY LOVE TO BRAG

23:23.073 --> 23:25.773
ABOUT WHEN IT'S THINGS WE'RE

23:25.842 --> 23:26.541
PROUD OF, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S

23:26.610 --> 23:28.242
NOT JUST TRACTORS, TRUCK NUTS

23:28.311 --> 23:30.011
AND TOBY KEITH SONGS.

23:30.080 --> 23:30.578
SOMETIMES IT'S STUFF THAT'S

23:30.647 --> 23:37.647
KILLING PEOPLE.

23:38.021 --> 23:38.519
AND SO, HAVING EXPLAINED AT

23:38.588 --> 23:39.120
LEAST SOME OF HOW WE GOT HERE,

23:39.189 --> 23:39.720
NOW MIGHT BE THE TIME TO TALK

23:39.789 --> 23:40.154
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE.

23:40.223 --> 23:40.788
AS OF RIGHT NOW, HAMAS IS STILL

23:40.857 --> 23:43.693
REFUSING TO RELEASE THE HOSTAGES

23:45.228 --> 23:45.626
AND ISRAEL, IS BOMBING

23:45.695 --> 23:46.494
RELENTLESSLY, AND AGAIN,

23:46.563 --> 23:47.094
THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN KILLED SO

23:47.163 --> 23:54.163
FAR.

23:54.971 --> 23:55.503
ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

23:55.572 --> 23:56.104
MADDENING EFFORTS TO DOWNPLAY

23:56.173 --> 24:01.175
THE SUFFERING IN GAZA -- LIKE

24:01.244 --> 24:03.077
WHEN ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO THE

24:03.146 --> 24:03.845
U.N. SAID THIS, LAST WEEKEND.

24:03.914 --> 24:05.646
>> THERE IS NO HUMANITARIAN

24:05.715 --> 24:07.915
CRISIS IN GAZA.

24:07.984 --> 24:09.383
IN COORDINATION WITH THE U.S.

24:09.452 --> 24:10.785
AND THE U.N., WE ALLOWED THE

24:10.854 --> 24:12.386
NUMBER OF TRUCKS ENTERING GAZA

24:12.455 --> 24:15.490
NOW WITH FOOD AND MEDICINES TO

24:15.559 --> 24:17.992
REACH ALMOST 100 TRUCKS EVERY

24:18.061 --> 24:20.695
DAY.

24:20.764 --> 24:21.329
>> YOU'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, THAT

24:21.398 --> 24:21.963
THERE IS NO HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

24:22.032 --> 24:24.632
IN GAZA.

24:24.701 --> 24:26.934
THAT'S KIND OF AN AMAZING

24:27.003 --> 24:27.535
STATEMENT, BECAUSE THERE WERE

24:27.604 --> 24:28.102
HUMANITARIAN PROBLEMS THERE

24:28.171 --> 24:33.741
BEFORE THE WAR.

24:33.810 --> 24:37.812
AND NOW, OBVIOUSLY, IT HAS

24:37.881 --> 24:39.046
GOTTEN BAD.

24:39.115 --> 24:39.614
>> BUT, DANA -- OKAY, SO...

24:39.683 --> 24:40.181
>> TAKE THEIR NUMBERS ASIDE.

24:40.250 --> 24:40.748
IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE CRISIS

24:40.817 --> 24:44.652
POINT.

24:44.721 --> 24:45.253
>> YES, BUT I'M NOT -- NO, I'M

24:45.322 --> 24:46.053
NOT SAYING THAT THE LIFE IN GAZA

24:46.122 --> 24:53.122
IS GREAT.

24:53.730 --> 24:54.061
>> John: OH, OKAY.

24:54.130 --> 24:54.695
"I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GREAT" IS A

24:54.764 --> 24:55.263
SEVERE UNDERSTATEMENT THERE.

24:55.332 --> 24:57.031
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU SAY WHEN

24:57.100 --> 24:57.665
YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE BAND AT A

24:57.734 --> 24:59.734
WEDDING, OR A SANDWICH FROM

24:59.803 --> 25:00.234
PANERA BREAD.

25:00.303 --> 25:00.835
BUT IT'S NOT HOW YOU DESCRIBE

25:00.904 --> 25:02.870
LIFE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FUCKING

25:02.939 --> 25:03.337
WAR ZONE.

25:03.406 --> 25:04.705
BECAUSE THOSE ON THE GROUND IN

25:04.774 --> 25:05.673
GAZA WILL TELL YOU IT'S

25:05.742 --> 25:09.444
ABSOLUTELY A HUMANITARIAN

25:09.513 --> 25:09.911
CRISIS.

25:09.980 --> 25:10.511
JUST THIS WOMAN WHO WORKS WITH

25:10.580 --> 25:17.018
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS.

25:17.087 --> 25:17.652
>> IT IS THE WORST HUMANITARIAN

25:17.721 --> 25:18.252
CATASTROPHE I HAVE EXPERIENCED

25:18.321 --> 25:22.723
IN MY LIFETIME.

25:22.792 --> 25:23.357
YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN ACRONYM IN

25:23.426 --> 25:28.763
THE GAZA STRIP RIGHT NOW.

25:28.832 --> 25:29.297
YOU KNOW, I'M A PEDIATRIC

25:29.366 --> 25:29.897
INTENSIVE CARE DOCTOR, I SEE A

25:29.966 --> 25:30.498
LOT OF SUFFERING IN MY CAREER.

25:30.567 --> 25:31.132
THERE IS AN ACRONYM IN THE GAZA

25:31.201 --> 25:31.466
STRIP, WCNSF.

25:31.535 --> 25:32.033
WOUNDED CHILD, NO SURVIVING

25:32.102 --> 25:39.102
FAMILY.

25:41.845 --> 25:42.376
CHILDREN -- AND IT IS USED NOT

25:42.445 --> 25:42.977
INFREQUENTLY IN THE LAST THREE

25:43.046 --> 25:43.177
WEEKS.

25:43.246 --> 25:43.744
WOUNDED CHILD, NO SURVIVING

25:43.813 --> 25:44.345
FAMILY SHOULD NOT EXIST AS AN

25:44.414 --> 25:44.579
ACRONYM.

25:44.648 --> 25:45.046
>> John: SHE'S RIGHT.

25:45.115 --> 25:45.646
AND, PERSONALLY, I'M GOING TO

25:45.715 --> 25:46.514
TAKE MY CUES ABOUT WHAT

25:46.583 --> 25:47.315
CONSTITUTES A HUMANITARIAN

25:47.384 --> 25:49.250
CRISIS FROM THE HUMANITARIANS.

25:49.319 --> 25:49.884
AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE IT IN ME

25:49.953 --> 25:52.820
TO SHOW YOU FOOTAGE OF PEOPLE IN

25:52.889 --> 25:53.154
AGONY TONIGHT.

25:53.223 --> 25:57.091
BUT I DO WANT YOU TO SEE SOME

25:57.160 --> 25:57.592
KIDS IN GAZA WHO'VE BEEN

25:57.661 --> 25:58.259
DISPLACED, SPEAK ABOUT WHAT

25:58.328 --> 26:02.363
THEY'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.

26:02.432 --> 26:09.432
[SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE]

26:54.251 --> 26:55.283
>> John: YEAH, I'D REALLY LIKE

26:55.352 --> 26:57.785
THEM TO BE ABLE TO CHILL THE

26:57.854 --> 26:58.486
FUCK OUT, TOO.

26:58.555 --> 26:59.053
BECAUSE KIDS SHOULD NEVER BE

26:59.122 --> 27:02.056
LOSING SLEEP DUE TO FEAR OF WAR,

27:02.125 --> 27:02.690
THEY SHOULD ONLY BE LOSING SLEEP

27:02.759 --> 27:04.625
FOR COMPLETELY NORMAL KID

27:04.694 --> 27:05.460
REASONS, LIKE TUMMY ACHES FROM

27:05.529 --> 27:09.497
EATING TOO MUCH CANDY OR --

27:09.566 --> 27:10.131
APPARENTLY, FOR AUSTRALIAN KIDS

27:10.200 --> 27:10.998
-- STAYING UP EXCITED ALL NIGHT

27:11.067 --> 27:17.638
BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE AND

27:17.707 --> 27:18.239
YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF SANTA

27:18.308 --> 27:19.407
BROUGHT YOU A BRAND NEW BAG FOR

27:19.476 --> 27:20.041
ALL OF YOUR HOLIDAY HAM FOR SOME

27:20.110 --> 27:20.475
DEEPLY WEIRD REASON.

27:20.544 --> 27:23.344
IT SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH

27:23.413 --> 27:25.847
THOSE KIDS AND NOT FEEL

27:25.916 --> 27:26.514
SHATTERED.

27:26.583 --> 27:27.148
THERE IS A NATURAL HUMAN IMPULSE

27:27.217 --> 27:27.582
TO PROTECT CHILDREN.

27:27.651 --> 27:28.216
TO GRAB A TODDLER YOU DON'T KNOW

27:28.285 --> 27:28.783
IF YOU SEE THEM RUNNING INTO

27:28.852 --> 27:32.753
TRAFFIC.

27:32.822 --> 27:33.387
AND IF THAT IMPULSE IS BROKEN OR

27:33.456 --> 27:34.021
DISINCENTIVIZED BY A GOVERNMENT,

27:34.090 --> 27:34.489
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A

27:34.558 --> 27:35.723
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

27:35.792 --> 27:36.324
NO MATTER WHAT ANY ASSHOLE HAS

27:36.393 --> 27:39.193
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

27:39.262 --> 27:39.694
AND LOOK, I DON'T HAVE A

27:39.763 --> 27:42.463
SOLUTION FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE

27:42.532 --> 27:42.763
EAST.

27:42.832 --> 27:43.297
AND EVEN IF I DID -- WHICH

27:43.366 --> 27:43.931
AGAIN, I DON'T -- THIS WOULD BE

27:44.000 --> 27:46.534
THE WORST VOICE IN WHICH TO

27:46.603 --> 27:49.904
RELAY THAT MESSAGE.

27:49.973 --> 27:50.404
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME,

27:50.473 --> 27:52.807
PERSONALLY, THAT A CEASEFIRE HAS

27:52.876 --> 27:53.975
TO BE THE FIRST STEP.

27:54.044 --> 27:54.542
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

27:54.611 --> 27:55.610
HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR ALL OVER

27:55.679 --> 27:56.677
THE WORLD, BUT IT'S SOMETHING

27:56.746 --> 27:58.212
THAT WORLD LEADERS HAVE BEEN

27:58.281 --> 27:59.747
RELUCTANT TO SAY.

27:59.816 --> 28:00.381
JUST WATCH JUSTIN TRUDEAU ALMOST

28:00.450 --> 28:01.682
SAY IT, AND THEN CORRECT

28:01.751 --> 28:04.485
HIMSELF.

28:04.554 --> 28:06.687
>> WE NEED TO SEE A CEASE -- UH,

28:06.756 --> 28:09.223
WE NEED TO SEE A HUMANITARIAN

28:09.292 --> 28:11.526
PAUSE SO WE CAN FLOW -- WE NEED

28:11.595 --> 28:12.493
TO SEE A CEASING OF THE LEVELS

28:12.562 --> 28:14.962
OF VIOLENCE THAT WE'RE SEEING.

28:15.031 --> 28:17.899
>> John: WOW.

28:17.968 --> 28:18.466
HE STOPPED HIMSELF MID-WORD.

28:18.535 --> 28:19.433
HE LITERALLY ORDERED A CEASEFIRE

28:19.502 --> 28:23.004
ON THE WORD "CEASEFIRE."

28:23.073 --> 28:23.638
MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT HE DIDN'T

28:23.707 --> 28:26.741
JUST KEEP THAT WORD SALAD, OR

28:26.810 --> 28:27.375
WORD-POUTINE, GOING, "WE NEED A

28:27.444 --> 28:28.843
CEASING OF THE VIOLENCE, A

28:28.912 --> 28:31.078
STOPPING OF THE EXPLOSIONS --

28:31.147 --> 28:32.313
SORT OF A HALTING OF THE BOOMS,

28:32.382 --> 28:33.080
IF YOU WILL?

28:33.149 --> 28:39.854
A HALT-BOOM!

28:39.923 --> 28:40.388
WOULD BE GREAT RIGHT NOW."

28:40.457 --> 28:40.922
AND IT'S NOT JUST TRUDEAU.

28:40.991 --> 28:41.522
JOE BIDEN HAS SAID THERE'S NO

28:41.591 --> 28:41.856
CHANCE OF ONE.

28:41.925 --> 28:42.457
WHICH IS A HELL OF A THING TO

28:42.526 --> 28:43.491
HEAR FROM PERHAPS THE ONLY WORLD

28:43.560 --> 28:46.594
LEADER WHO COULD ACTUALLY EXERT

28:46.663 --> 28:47.161
SOME PRESSURE HERE.

28:47.230 --> 28:47.895
AND LISTEN, THERE ARE THOSE,

28:47.964 --> 28:50.898
LIKE NOTED MID-EAST PEACE EXPERT

28:50.967 --> 28:52.099
HARVEY LEVIN, WHO WILL SAY, NOT

28:52.168 --> 28:53.501
WRONGLY, THAT THERE ARE REAL

28:53.570 --> 28:54.836
DANGERS TO A CEASEFIRE -- THAT

28:54.905 --> 28:56.170
HAMAS MIGHT REGROUP ONCE THE

28:56.239 --> 28:58.606
BOMBING STOPS.

28:58.675 --> 28:59.240
ALTHOUGH, THAT'S ARGUABLY GOING

28:59.309 --> 29:00.308
TO BE A DANGER WHENEVER IT

29:00.377 --> 29:01.476
STOPS.

29:01.545 --> 29:03.344
SO WHY NOT STOP RIGHT NOW?

29:03.413 --> 29:04.278
CONTINUING DOWN THIS PATH ONLY

29:04.347 --> 29:05.146
CREATES MORE EXTREMISTS, WHICH

29:05.215 --> 29:07.482
IS THE LAST THING THAT ANYONE

29:07.551 --> 29:07.915
NEEDS.

29:07.984 --> 29:08.683
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING

29:08.752 --> 29:10.151
THAT DENIES THE PAIN OF THOSE IN

29:10.220 --> 29:13.020
ISRAEL, WHO'VE LOST LOVED ONES

29:13.089 --> 29:13.688
TO A TRULY BARBAROUS ACT, OR WHO

29:13.757 --> 29:14.522
ARE WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE

29:14.591 --> 29:18.025
RETURN OF HOSTAGES.

29:18.094 --> 29:20.461
ALTHOUGH, YOU SHOULD KNOW, SOME

29:20.530 --> 29:21.028
HOSTAGES' FAMILIES ARE ALSO

29:21.097 --> 29:22.997
UTTERLY FURIOUS AT THE MILITARY

29:23.066 --> 29:23.598
TACTICS NETANYAHU'S EMPLOYING

29:23.667 --> 29:24.365
RIGHT NOW.

29:24.434 --> 29:24.866
>> WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN

29:24.935 --> 29:27.835
NEGOTIATIONS.

29:27.904 --> 29:28.503
WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW.

29:28.572 --> 29:30.338
THEY SAY THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO

29:30.407 --> 29:30.905
DESTROY -- TO FLATTEN GAZA.

29:30.974 --> 29:31.405
THEY NEVER MENTIONS THE

29:31.474 --> 29:35.309
HOSTAGES, NEVER.

29:35.378 --> 29:35.676
>> John: RIGHT.

29:35.745 --> 29:36.611
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW INFURIATING

29:36.680 --> 29:38.446
THAT WOULD BE.

29:38.515 --> 29:39.313
AND I KNOW THAT FOR MANY

29:39.382 --> 29:40.248
ISRAELIS, THERE IS AN

29:40.317 --> 29:42.950
UNDERSTANDABLE SENSE OF FEAR AND

29:43.019 --> 29:43.551
PRECARITY RIGHT NOW, AMID THE

29:43.620 --> 29:44.552
SPECTER OF HAMAS ATTACKS AND

29:44.621 --> 29:46.821
ROCKETS OVERHEAD.

29:46.890 --> 29:47.255
BUT IT'S WORTH ALSO

29:47.324 --> 29:50.057
ACKNOWLEDGING THE OVERWHELMING

29:50.126 --> 29:50.892
SENSE OF PRECARITY AMONG

29:50.961 --> 29:53.961
PALESTINIANS, LIVING UNDER A

29:54.030 --> 29:54.495
BLOCKADE, AND A BARRAGE OF

29:54.564 --> 29:55.396
ISRAELI ROCKETS.

29:55.465 --> 29:56.631
AND IT HAS TO BE POSSIBLE TO

29:56.700 --> 29:58.032
FEEL THE PAIN IN ONE COMMUNITY

29:58.101 --> 29:58.633
WITHOUT DENYING IT IN ANOTHER.

29:58.702 --> 30:02.537
IT HAS TO BE.

30:02.606 --> 30:03.104
THAT IS, PERHAPS, THE MOST

30:03.173 --> 30:05.339
NECESSARY PRECONDITION FOR

30:05.408 --> 30:06.908
PEACE.

30:06.977 --> 30:08.309
BECAUSE REAL PEACE HERE WILL

30:08.378 --> 30:10.077
CLEARLY BE DIFFICULT.

30:10.146 --> 30:12.246
IT'S GOING TO BE STRUGGLED

30:12.315 --> 30:12.814
TOWARD, AS PART OF A LARGER

30:12.883 --> 30:14.115
PURSUIT OF JUSTICE, WHICH WILL

30:14.184 --> 30:15.183
IN TURN REQUIRE AN HONEST AND

30:15.252 --> 30:17.418
UNCOMFORTABLE RECKONING WITH ALL

30:17.487 --> 30:18.252
THE DECISIONS THAT BROUGHT US TO

30:18.321 --> 30:21.155
THIS POINT.

30:21.224 --> 30:22.156
AND I KNOW HOPE IS SCARCE RIGHT

30:22.225 --> 30:23.057
NOW, BUT I DID SEE SOMETHING

30:23.126 --> 30:24.525
THIS WEEK WHICH GAVE ME A SEED

30:24.594 --> 30:26.093
OF HOPE.

30:26.162 --> 30:29.263
IT INVOLVED THIS ISRAELI MAN,

30:29.332 --> 30:30.465
RAMI ELHANAN, WHO LOST HIS

30:30.534 --> 30:31.766
14-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TO A HAMAS

30:31.835 --> 30:33.601
SUICIDE BOMBING 26 YEARS AGO.

30:33.670 --> 30:34.735
HE ACTUALLY CO-DIRECTS A GROUP

30:34.804 --> 30:36.304
CALLED "THE PARENTS CIRCLE,"

30:36.373 --> 30:37.105
WITH THAT PALESTINIAN MAN.

30:37.174 --> 30:44.174
ELHANAN WAS ASKED IF RECENT

30:44.648 --> 30:46.214
EVENTS HAD CHANGED HIS WORLDVIEW

30:46.283 --> 30:47.448
AT ALL, AND HIS RESPONSE IS

30:47.517 --> 30:50.718
WORTH LISTENING TO.

30:50.787 --> 30:51.552
>> YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN A CIRCLE

30:51.621 --> 30:52.120
OF BLOOD FOR-FOR THE LAST 75

30:52.189 --> 30:54.388
YEARS.

30:54.457 --> 30:55.022
AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ROUND.

30:55.091 --> 31:00.394
NOBODY EXPECTED THE VICIOUSNESS

31:00.463 --> 31:01.829
AND THE CRUELTY OF THIS ROUND,

31:01.898 --> 31:04.532
BUT IT WAS EXPECTED.

31:04.601 --> 31:05.299
YOU CANNOT PUT TWO MILLION

31:05.368 --> 31:06.367
PEOPLE IN A BOX, CLOSE THE COVER

31:06.436 --> 31:08.503
AND, EXPECT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.

31:08.572 --> 31:09.137
IT WILL NOT STOP UNLESS WE TALK.

31:09.206 --> 31:12.273
YOU CANNOT ANNIHILATE HAMAS.

31:12.342 --> 31:18.846
YOU CANNOT IGNORE SIX MILLION

31:18.915 --> 31:19.413
PEOPLE, PALESTINIANS, LIVING

31:19.482 --> 31:22.517
HERE IN THE HOLY LAND.

31:22.586 --> 31:25.119
AND YOU CANNOT EXPECT THEM TO GO

31:25.188 --> 31:27.755
AWAY.

31:27.824 --> 31:28.222
THEY WILL NOT GO AWAY.

31:28.291 --> 31:28.656
WE WILL NOT GO AWAY.

31:28.725 --> 31:29.190
WE ARE DOOMED TO LIVE HERE

31:29.259 --> 31:30.391
TOGETHER, AND WE HAVE TO CHOOSE

31:30.460 --> 31:32.026
WHETHER TO SHARE THIS LAND OR TO

31:32.095 --> 31:33.761
SHARE THE GRAVEYARD UNDER IT.

31:33.830 --> 31:36.430
>> John: EXACTLY.

31:36.499 --> 31:37.331
AND IT IS INSPIRING THAT --

31:37.400 --> 31:38.633
DESPITE WHAT THAT MAN WENT

31:38.702 --> 31:40.234
THROUGH -- HE'S STILL COMMITTED

31:40.303 --> 31:42.603
TO ACHIEVING PEACE THROUGH

31:42.672 --> 31:42.937
TALKING.

31:43.006 --> 31:43.404
AND IT SHOWS THAT ANY

31:43.473 --> 31:44.839
CONVERSATION AROUND THIS HAS TO

31:44.908 --> 31:45.473
BEGIN WITH EMPATHY OR WE'RE JUST

31:45.542 --> 31:47.642
FUCKED.

31:47.711 --> 31:48.743
AND OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T KNOW HOW

31:48.812 --> 31:50.778
ALL THIS ENDS.

31:50.847 --> 31:51.879
BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WE DO

31:51.948 --> 31:52.079
KNOW.

31:52.148 --> 31:54.549
WE KNOW THAT DEHUMANIZING PEOPLE

31:54.618 --> 31:56.050
LEADS TO VIOLENCE.

31:56.119 --> 31:56.651
WE KNOW THAT VIOLENCE LEADS TO

31:56.720 --> 31:58.653
EVEN MORE BRUTALITY AND

31:58.722 --> 31:59.253
DESTRUCTION.

31:59.322 --> 32:00.254
AND WE KNOW THAT, CRUCIALLY,

32:00.323 --> 32:01.689
BREAKING THAT CYCLE IS

32:01.758 --> 32:02.290
UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO REQUIRE

32:02.359 --> 32:03.257
LEADERSHIP SIGNIFICANTLY

32:03.326 --> 32:04.725
DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES

32:04.794 --> 32:05.993
CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

32:06.062 --> 32:08.696
AND NOW, THIS.

32:08.765 --> 32:11.666
>> Announcer: AND NOW, RACHEL

32:11.735 --> 32:13.000
CAMPOS DUFFY REALLY, REALLY

32:13.069 --> 32:16.971
NEEDS YOU TO KNOW THAT HER

32:17.040 --> 32:22.577
HUSBAND WAS ONCE IN CONGRESS.

32:22.646 --> 32:24.178
>> I BROUGHT THIS UP TO YOU GUYS

32:24.247 --> 32:24.779
IN CONGRESS.

32:24.848 --> 32:25.379
MY HUSBAND GOT TO DO THAT WHEN

32:25.448 --> 32:27.148
HE WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:27.217 --> 32:28.685
YOU NKOW, MY HUSBAND'S A FORMER

32:29.452 --> 32:30.017
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, AS YOU KNOW.

32:30.086 --> 32:30.651
MY HUSBAND HIRED PEOPLE ALL THE

32:30.720 --> 32:31.252
TIME WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF

32:31.321 --> 32:34.956
CONGRESS.

32:35.025 --> 32:36.224
YOUR BROTHER WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:36.293 --> 32:37.792
MY HUSBAND WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:37.861 --> 32:39.393
IT'S SO INTERESTING, BECAUSE YOU

32:39.462 --> 32:40.228
TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE MY HUSBAND,

32:40.297 --> 32:41.996
WHO WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:42.065 --> 32:45.633
WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:45.702 --> 32:46.200
EVERY DAY WHEN MY HUSBAND IN

32:46.269 --> 32:46.667
CONGRESS.

32:46.736 --> 32:47.535
MY HUSBAND WHEN HE WAS IN

32:47.604 --> 32:47.969
CONGRESS.

32:48.038 --> 32:48.536
MY HUSBAND WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:48.605 --> 32:51.839
MY HUSBAND WAS IN CONGRESS.

32:51.908 --> 32:54.642
MY HUSBAND WAS A MEMBER OF

32:54.711 --> 32:55.710
CONGRESS.

32:55.779 --> 32:56.244
MY HUSBAND WAS ELECTED TO

32:56.313 --> 33:03.313
CONGRESS.

33:05.755 --> 33:08.422
LET ME GET TO ANOTHER TOPIC

33:08.491 --> 33:09.223
THAT'S INTERESTING, AS YOU KNOW

33:09.292 --> 33:09.757
MY HUSBAND WAS A MEMBER OF

33:09.826 --> 33:10.024
CONGRESS.

33:10.093 --> 33:10.458
>> John: MOVING ON.

33:10.527 --> 33:11.092
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK UPDATE

33:11.161 --> 33:11.492
ABOUT NEW ZEALAND.

33:11.561 --> 33:12.260
YOU MAY REMEMBER LAST WEEK, WE

33:12.329 --> 33:12.760
WADED INTO THEIR HIGHLY

33:12.829 --> 33:13.261
COMPETITIVE "BIRD OF THE

33:13.330 --> 33:13.828
CENTURY" CONTEST, RUN BY THE

33:13.897 --> 33:14.729
CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION

33:14.798 --> 33:17.865
FOREST & BIRD.

33:17.934 --> 33:18.733
BASICALLY, EVERY YEAR

33:18.802 --> 33:19.867
NEW ZEALANDERS VOTE FOR THEIR

33:19.936 --> 33:20.668
FAVORITE BIRD AND ULTIMATELY

33:20.737 --> 33:22.603
ELECT A NEW BIRD KING.

33:22.672 --> 33:24.105
IT'S JUST EXCELLENT.

33:24.174 --> 33:25.173
AND WE ANNOUNCED OURSELVES AS

33:25.242 --> 33:29.343
THE OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN MANAGERS

33:29.412 --> 33:30.111
OF THIS BIRD, THE PUTEKETEKE.

33:30.180 --> 33:33.014
AND I'LL NEVER TIRE OF SAYING

33:33.083 --> 33:33.314
IT OUT LOUD.

33:33.383 --> 33:33.614
PUTEKETEKE.

33:33.683 --> 33:34.248
IT'S THE BIRD NAME EQUIVALENT OF

33:34.317 --> 33:34.882
RUBBING YOUR GUMS WITH COCAINE,

33:34.951 --> 33:35.883
OR FILLING YOUR MOUTH WITH POP

33:35.952 --> 33:37.552
ROCKS AND CHUGGING A COKE.

33:37.621 --> 33:41.022
AND LOOK AT THE PLUMAGE!

33:41.091 --> 33:41.923
IT HAS THE GRACE OF A SWAN AND

33:41.992 --> 33:46.060
THE HAIR OF AN EMO GUY FIERI.

33:46.129 --> 33:46.661
TO CAMPAIGN FOR IT, WE PUT UP

33:46.730 --> 33:47.795
ADS IN NEW ZEALAND, PARIS,

33:47.864 --> 33:49.363
MUMBAI, TOKYO, AND LONDON.

33:49.432 --> 33:53.468
WE FLEW A BANNER OVER IPANEMA

33:53.537 --> 33:55.736
BEACH IN BRAZIL, AND, NATURALLY,

33:55.805 --> 33:56.604
PUT UP A BILLBOARD IN MANITOWOC,

33:56.673 --> 33:58.673
WISCONSIN.

33:58.742 --> 34:00.108
AND IT SEEMS, OUR PROMOTION

34:00.177 --> 34:00.741
WORKED, BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A

34:00.810 --> 34:01.676
HUGE INFLUX OF VOTES THIS WEEK

34:01.745 --> 34:04.479
THAT, ACCORDING TO

34:04.548 --> 34:05.046
FOREST & BIRD, THEIR VOTING

34:05.115 --> 34:06.647
VERIFICATION SYSTEM GOT

34:06.716 --> 34:07.515
OVERLOADED AND TEMPORARILY

34:07.584 --> 34:09.550
CRASHED.

34:09.619 --> 34:11.185
THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO DELAY

34:11.254 --> 34:11.786
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WINNER

34:11.855 --> 34:12.153
UNTIL WEDNESDAY.

34:12.222 --> 34:15.790
SO WHILE WE DON'T YET KNOW WHO

34:15.859 --> 34:16.424
WON, I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT

34:16.493 --> 34:17.625
TO ADDRESS THE RESPONSE TO OUR

34:17.694 --> 34:20.027
CAMPAIGN IN NEW ZEALAND.

34:20.096 --> 34:21.796
BECAUSE IT WASN'T ALL POSITIVE.

34:21.865 --> 34:22.497
>> JOHN OLIVER, THE LATE NIGHT

34:22.566 --> 34:25.533
HOST, AND FORMER BIRD HIMSELF --

34:40.517 --> 34:41.716
CONVINCE KIWIS.

34:41.785 --> 34:42.283

34:42.352 --> 34:43.451
STILL?

34:43.520 --> 34:44.252

34:51.127 --> 34:52.026
COMING OUT AND ESSENTIALLY

34:52.095 --> 34:57.098
HIJACKING BIRD OF THE CENTURY.

34:57.167 --> 34:58.065
I DON'T EVEN THINK HE LIKES

34:58.134 --> 34:58.466
BIRDS.

34:58.535 --> 35:01.536
>> John: HEY, HEY, HEY!

35:01.605 --> 35:02.537
OKAY, NOW I'M INSULTED.

35:02.606 --> 35:03.805
NOT BECAUSE OF THE B-GRADE

35:03.874 --> 35:04.906
AMERICAN CELEBRITY PART, THAT'S

35:04.975 --> 35:05.640
HONESTLY GENEROUS.

35:05.709 --> 35:06.474
BUT HOW DARE YOU SAY I DON'T

35:06.543 --> 35:07.909
LIKE BIRDS!

35:07.978 --> 35:09.143
I LOVE THEM!

35:09.212 --> 35:11.045
I JUST DON'T LIKE YOUR BIRD.

35:11.114 --> 35:12.613
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE

35:12.682 --> 35:14.482
DONKEY KONG'S HAIRY TESTICLE.

35:14.551 --> 35:15.082
IT LOOKS LIKE A RAT CARRYING A

35:15.151 --> 35:16.250
TOOTHPICK.

35:16.319 --> 35:18.619
BUT SHE WASN'T THE ONLY

35:18.688 --> 35:19.220
NEW ZEALANDER WHO GOT A LITTLE

35:19.289 --> 35:20.888
TESTY WITH US.

35:20.957 --> 35:22.290
THERE WAS ALSO THIS WOMAN.

35:22.359 --> 35:22.924
>> YOU WANT TO TAKE THE PISS OUT

35:22.993 --> 35:25.460
OF OUR VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION,

35:25.529 --> 35:27.829
THEN I SEND 14 EMAILS TO

35:27.898 --> 35:32.266
EVERYONE ON YOUR TEAM TO TRY AND

35:32.335 --> 35:32.800
GET YOU TO COME AND DEFEND

35:32.869 --> 35:33.434
YOURSELF ON ANOTHER BIRD DEBATE

35:33.503 --> 35:34.302
AND YOU SAID "NO."

35:34.371 --> 35:35.670
UM, WOW.

35:35.739 --> 35:36.804
>> THAT'S A STOOL FOR YOU,

35:36.873 --> 35:37.605
JOHN OLIVER, IF YOU WANT TO PUT

35:37.674 --> 35:38.206
YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS

35:38.275 --> 35:40.274
ABOUT YOUR BIRD.

35:40.343 --> 35:42.009
EMPTY CHAIR.

35:42.078 --> 35:42.743
>> DO YOU HAVE A BIRD?

35:42.812 --> 35:43.111
>> YEAH, KERERU.

35:43.180 --> 35:45.379
IT'S THE BEST BIRD.

35:45.448 --> 35:47.281
>> John: OKAY, OKAY, LET ME

35:47.350 --> 35:47.849
ADDRESS THAT.

35:47.918 --> 35:48.449
OF COURSE I SAID "NO" TO THAT

35:48.518 --> 35:48.683
DEBATE.

35:48.752 --> 35:49.283
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO ARGUE

35:49.352 --> 35:50.184
WITH SOMEONE THAT WRONG.

35:50.253 --> 35:53.721
THIS IS THE BEST BIRD?

35:53.790 --> 35:54.355
PLEASE, IT'S A FUCKING PIGEON IN

35:54.424 --> 35:58.793
A TANK TOP.

35:58.862 --> 36:05.166
DEBATE OVER.

36:05.235 --> 36:05.766
I'M NOT GETTING ON A PLANE TO

36:05.835 --> 36:06.234
DESTROY YOU LIKE THAT.

36:06.303 --> 36:06.868
AND LOOK, SOME BIRD CAMPAIGNERS

36:06.937 --> 36:08.069
DID ACCEPT OUR INTERFERENCE WITH

36:08.138 --> 36:08.669
GRACE, LIKE SUPPORTERS OF THE

36:08.738 --> 36:09.237
TITIPOUNAMU, WHO POSTED THIS

36:09.306 --> 36:10.938
IMAGE SAYING "THAT'S ME IN THE

36:11.007 --> 36:12.240
CORNER, THAT'S ME IN THE

36:12.309 --> 36:13.441
SPOTLIGHT, LOSING A BIRD

36:13.510 --> 36:15.910
COMPETITION."

36:15.979 --> 36:17.345
BUT OTHERS CAME OUT SWINGING.

36:17.414 --> 36:18.980
SUPPORTERS OF THE KAKARIKI

36:19.049 --> 36:21.382
KARAKA DESIGNED THIS RETALIATORY

36:21.451 --> 36:22.984
BILLBOARD, SAYING "DEAR JOHN,

36:23.053 --> 36:24.786
DON'T DISRUPT THE PECKING ORDER"

36:24.855 --> 36:25.620
AND PUT THEM UP ALL OVER THE

36:25.689 --> 36:31.626
PLACE.

36:31.695 --> 36:34.395
AND I REALLY RESPECT THAT KIND

36:34.464 --> 36:34.729
OF AGGRESSION.

36:34.798 --> 36:35.329
BUT THE KAKARIKI KARAKA HAS NO

36:35.398 --> 36:35.897
BUSINESS BEING IN THIS

36:35.966 --> 36:36.197
COMPETITION.

36:36.266 --> 36:36.731
"BIRD OF THE CENTURY" IS A

36:36.800 --> 36:37.298
CONTEST FOR REAL BIRDS, NOT

36:37.367 --> 36:41.869
BRIGHT-GREEN CAT TOYS.

36:41.938 --> 36:42.370
EVEN THIS PROFESSIONAL

36:42.439 --> 36:43.204
BASKETBALL TEAM GOT INVOLVED,

36:43.273 --> 36:44.539
POSTING THIS VIDEO OF A

36:44.608 --> 36:45.173
BILLBOARD THEY PUT UP ALONGSIDE

36:45.242 --> 36:46.340
THEIR MASCOT AND BIRD OF THE

36:46.409 --> 36:48.276
YEAR PICK, THE KEA.

36:48.345 --> 36:50.878
AND IF YOU MISSED IT, THAT

36:50.947 --> 36:52.613
BILLBOARD SAYS, "THE ONLY BIRD

36:52.682 --> 36:53.614
WORSE THAN THE PUTEKETEKE IS

36:53.683 --> 36:55.716
ZAZU."

36:55.785 --> 36:57.485
AND I'LL ADMIT, I'LL ADMIT,

36:57.554 --> 37:03.024
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

37:03.093 --> 37:04.859
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THE JOKES

37:04.928 --> 37:06.160
ON YOU,YOU PHOTOSHOPPED MY FACE

37:06.229 --> 37:06.561
ONTO CARTOON ZAZU.

37:06.630 --> 37:06.961
I'M NOT THAT ONE.

37:07.030 --> 37:07.428
I'M NOT THE FUN ONE.

37:07.497 --> 37:07.995
I'M THE TERRIFYING ONE, THAT

37:08.064 --> 37:08.629
PUTS PRIDE ROCK SMACK DAB IN THE

37:08.698 --> 37:11.899
MIDDLE OF THE UNCANNY VALLEY.

37:11.968 --> 37:12.533
THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN FOR

37:12.602 --> 37:13.100
THE SOUTHERN DOTTEREL WHICH

37:13.169 --> 37:14.402
POSTED THIS PHOTO OF IT WALKING

37:14.471 --> 37:14.869
IN ON ME IN BED WITH A

37:14.938 --> 37:18.306
PUTEKETEKE.

37:18.375 --> 37:20.141
AGAIN, VERY GOOD.

37:20.210 --> 37:21.175
AND I LOVE ALL THE TINY DETAILS,

37:21.244 --> 37:24.378
FROM THE POST-BIRD-SEX CIGARETTE

37:24.447 --> 37:25.279
THAT I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND.

37:25.348 --> 37:26.147
TO THE CHOICE OF THE DOTTEREL

37:26.216 --> 37:27.548
PHOTO.

37:27.617 --> 37:28.082
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY THE

37:28.151 --> 37:29.417
EXPRESSION A DOTTEREL WOULD MAKE

37:29.486 --> 37:30.017
IF IT WALKED IN ON ITS SPOUSE

37:30.086 --> 37:34.922
CHEATING ON IT.

37:34.991 --> 37:35.890
BUT AMID ALL THE BLOWBACK, THERE

37:35.959 --> 37:36.524
WAS ONE ACCUSATION I CANNOT LET

37:36.593 --> 37:36.724
PASS.

37:36.793 --> 37:37.391
AND IT COMES FROM THAT

37:37.460 --> 37:38.860
CAMPAIGNER FOR THE KIWI YOU SAW

37:38.929 --> 37:40.795
EARLIER, WHO TOLD A NEWS OUTLET,

37:40.864 --> 37:42.130
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE

37:42.199 --> 37:42.997
NEW ZEALAND, TO BE HONEST.

37:43.066 --> 37:45.066
ANYTIME WE FEATURE ON HIS SHOW

37:45.135 --> 37:46.601
IT'S SO HE CAN LAUGH AT US.

37:46.670 --> 37:47.235
WE'RE THE BUTT OF HIS JOKES AND

37:47.304 --> 37:48.636
HE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

37:48.705 --> 37:50.104
AND LOOK, I AM DOING IT AGAIN.

37:50.173 --> 37:52.073
YEAH, I AM.

37:52.142 --> 37:52.640
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T

37:52.709 --> 37:55.376
LIKE YOU.

37:55.445 --> 37:56.010
IT'S BECAUSE I FUCKING LOVE YOU.

37:56.079 --> 38:01.115
NEW ZEALAND, YOU ARE SO GOOD AT

38:01.184 --> 38:01.649
NOT JUST TALKING SHIT, BUT

38:01.718 --> 38:02.416
TAKING IT, WITH REMARKABLE GOOD

38:02.485 --> 38:03.985
HUMOR.

38:04.054 --> 38:04.619
I TALK ABOUT YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE

38:04.688 --> 38:06.120
YOU'RE THE MOST FASCINATING

38:06.189 --> 38:06.521
COUNTRY ON EARTH.

38:06.590 --> 38:08.790
YOU HOLD BIRD CONTESTS, YOU

38:08.859 --> 38:10.024
SOMETIMES THROW DILDOS AT YOUR

38:10.093 --> 38:13.561
POLITICIANS, YOU LET YOUR PEOPLE

38:13.630 --> 38:15.096
SUBMIT IMAGES LIKE THIS FOR YOUR

38:15.165 --> 38:16.464
NATIONAL FLAG -- YOU'RE AN

38:16.533 --> 38:18.132
ENDLESS WELL OF JOY.

38:18.201 --> 38:19.534
HONESTLY, I'D TALK ABOUT YOU

38:19.603 --> 38:20.902
EVERY WEEK IF IT WEREN'T FOR ALL

38:20.971 --> 38:22.136
THE OTHER CRAZY SHIT GOING ON IN

38:22.205 --> 38:22.937
THE WORLD.

38:23.006 --> 38:24.839
I WOULD RENAME THIS SHOW

38:24.908 --> 38:25.740
"NEW ZEALAND TONIGHT WITH

38:25.809 --> 38:27.041
JOHN OLIVER" AND IT WOULD BE AN

38:27.110 --> 38:29.577
IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT.

38:29.646 --> 38:31.078
AND FOR THE RECORD, ALL OF YOUR

38:31.147 --> 38:32.814
BIRDS ARE GREAT, AND IT WOULD BE

38:32.883 --> 38:34.982
AN HONOR TO LOSE TO ANY OF THEM

38:35.051 --> 38:36.184
WHEN RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED ON

38:36.253 --> 38:38.286
WEDNESDAY.

38:38.355 --> 38:39.787
AND THE REASON IT'S SO EASY FOR

38:39.856 --> 38:41.456
ME TO SAY THAT IS, WE'RE NOT

38:41.525 --> 38:42.356
GOING TO LOSE, ARE WE?

38:42.425 --> 38:43.825
WE'RE GOING TO WIN.

38:43.894 --> 38:45.393
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN BY A LOT.

38:45.462 --> 38:47.795
AND WHEN WE DO THAT, THE

38:47.864 --> 38:48.563
PUTEKETEKE WILL BE YOUR BIRD OF

38:48.632 --> 38:49.697
THE CENTURY, AND THERE'S NOTHING

38:49.766 --> 38:51.666
ANY OF YOU CAN DO TO STOP THAT

38:51.735 --> 38:55.136
RIGHT NOW.

38:55.205 --> 38:55.837
MAYBE GOOD LUCK NEXT CENTURY,

38:55.906 --> 38:56.137
NEW ZEALAND.

38:56.206 --> 38:57.605
THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANK YOU SO

38:57.674 --> 38:59.407
MUCH FOR WATCHING.

38:59.476 --> 39:00.675
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
