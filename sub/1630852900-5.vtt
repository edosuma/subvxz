WEBVTT

00:32.633 --> 00:33.633
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.700 --> 00:35.200
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:35.266 --> 00:35.900
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.966 --> 00:36.300
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:36.366 --> 00:37.766
FOR JOINING US.

00:37.833 --> 00:38.533
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:38.600 --> 00:39.766
THE WEEK, WHICH HAS BEEN BUSY.

00:39.833 --> 00:40.866
RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE

00:40.933 --> 00:42.100
ENTERED ITS SECOND MONTH,

00:42.166 --> 00:43.700
NORTH KOREA LAUNCHED ITS BIGGEST

00:43.766 --> 00:44.733
MISSILE TEST IN YEARS, AND HERE

00:44.800 --> 00:46.566
IN THE U.S., THE SENATE HELD

00:46.633 --> 00:47.866
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR JUDGE

00:47.933 --> 00:49.133
KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, WHERE SHE

00:49.200 --> 00:50.266
HAD TO ANSWER SOME ABSOLUTELY

00:50.333 --> 00:53.333
BATSHIT QUESTIONS.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.733
>> ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,

00:54.800 --> 00:56.400
HOW FAITHFUL WOULD YOU SAY

00:56.466 --> 01:00.666
YOU ARE IN TERMS OF RELIGION?

01:00.733 --> 01:01.533
>> I'M AN HISPANIC MAN.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.466
COULD I DECIDE I WAS

01:02.533 --> 01:03.633
AN ASIAN MAN?

01:03.700 --> 01:04.433
>> DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

01:04.500 --> 01:05.700
CATCH AND IMPRISON MORE

01:05.766 --> 01:06.300
MURDERERS OR FEWER

01:06.366 --> 01:08.366
MURDERERS?

01:08.433 --> 01:09.266
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS BOOK

01:09.333 --> 01:10.400
THAT IS BEING TAUGHT WITH KIDS

01:10.466 --> 01:14.200
THAT BABIES ARE RACIST?

01:14.266 --> 01:23.033
>> SENATOR.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.166
I DO NOT BELIEVE...

01:25.233 --> 01:25.866
OKAY, JUST STOP.

01:25.933 --> 01:26.500
BECAUSE FOR A SECOND, DON'T

01:26.566 --> 01:27.300
FOCUS ON THE STUPIDITY OF THE

01:27.366 --> 01:28.600
QUESTIONS, JUST APPRECIATE HOW

01:28.666 --> 01:31.000
EXQUISITE THAT PAUSE WAS.

01:31.066 --> 01:33.133
IN IT WAS CONTAINED THE STRENGTH

01:33.200 --> 01:34.400
AND PATIENCE OF EVERY

01:34.466 --> 01:35.533
BLACK WOMAN BEING STRETCHED TO

01:35.600 --> 01:37.966
ITS ABSOLUTE LIMIT.

01:38.033 --> 01:39.066
IN THAT PAUSE WAS THE DIVINE

01:39.133 --> 01:40.133
CALCULUS WHERE SHE HAD TO

01:40.200 --> 01:41.700
BALANCE "HOW MUCH DO I WANT

01:41.766 --> 01:42.633
THIS JOB?"

01:42.700 --> 01:44.200
AND "HOW MUCH DO I WANT TO CUSS

01:44.266 --> 01:45.600
OUT THESE PREPOSTEROUS PEOPLE?"

01:45.666 --> 01:47.000
CALL IT THE CHISHOLM-JOHNSON

01:47.066 --> 01:49.400
FORMULA.

01:49.466 --> 01:51.000
AND LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THOSE

01:51.066 --> 01:51.766
QUESTIONS WEREN'T ASKED BECAUSE

01:51.833 --> 01:52.366
THEY GENUINELY WANTED TO KNOW

01:52.433 --> 01:52.700
THE ANSWER.

01:52.766 --> 01:53.266
THEY WERE ASKED TO GENERATE

01:53.333 --> 01:55.166
VIRAL SOUNDBITES.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.233
THE PROOF OF WHICH IS IN THIS

01:56.300 --> 01:57.966
IMAGE OF TED CRUZ, RIGHT AFTER

01:58.033 --> 01:59.066
HIS QUESTIONING, WHERE HE'S

01:59.133 --> 02:00.633
CHECKING HIS MENTIONS ON TWITTER

02:00.700 --> 02:02.600
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

02:02.666 --> 02:03.800
WHICH IS HONESTLY KIND OF

02:03.866 --> 02:05.366
AMAZING.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.433
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING TED CRUZ

02:06.500 --> 02:09.533
AND WANTING TO HEAR WHAT

02:09.600 --> 02:10.766
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU?

02:10.833 --> 02:12.933
ON THE INTERNET?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.033
THAT'S A DOOM-SCROLL

02:14.100 --> 02:16.100
THAT WILL NOT END WELL.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.066
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ON

02:17.133 --> 02:18.200
TO THE ROYAL FAMILY.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.833
THEY'VE HAD A PRETTY TOUGH YEAR,

02:19.900 --> 02:20.466
COMPARED TO NO ONE ELSE WHO'S

02:20.533 --> 02:22.333
EVER LIVED, FROM HARRY AND

02:22.400 --> 02:23.733
MEGHAN TALKING TO OPRAH TO

02:23.800 --> 02:24.833
PRINCE ANDREW BEING STRIPPED OF

02:24.900 --> 02:26.966
HIS TITLES AFTER --

02:27.033 --> 02:28.266
WILL LEGAL LET ME MENTION

02:28.333 --> 02:29.633
THE THINGS HE DID?

02:29.700 --> 02:30.566
THEY WON'T?

02:30.633 --> 02:31.366
EVEN THOUGH HE DEFINITELY DID

02:31.433 --> 02:31.933
THEM?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.100
OKAY, I GUESS FORGET

02:34.166 --> 02:35.233
THOSE THINGS I MENTIONED

02:35.300 --> 02:36.766
THAT HE DEFINITELY DID.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.000
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG

02:38.066 --> 02:39.200
WEEK FOR THE ROYALS, WITH PRINCE

02:39.266 --> 02:40.000
WILLIAM AND KATE MIDDLETON

02:40.066 --> 02:40.633
EMBARKING ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT

02:40.700 --> 02:45.766
TO THE CARIBBEAN.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.133
>> THE MOMENTS ROYAL

02:47.200 --> 02:47.533
TOURS ARE MADE OF.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.000
THE DUKE AND DUCHESS

02:48.066 --> 02:48.633
OF CAMBRIDGE DANCING

02:48.700 --> 02:50.133
WITH LOCALS IN BELIZE, A VISIT

02:50.200 --> 02:51.000
OFFICIALLY TO MARK THE QUEEN'S

02:51.066 --> 02:53.500
70 YEARS ON THE THRONE,

02:53.566 --> 02:54.533
ALSO BEING DUBBED

02:54.600 --> 03:02.766
A "CHARM OFFENSIVE",

03:02.833 --> 03:03.966
AN ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE CARIBBEAN

03:04.033 --> 03:04.500
NATIONS TO HANG ONTO THE

03:04.566 --> 03:04.766
MONARCHY.

03:04.833 --> 03:05.900
"CHARM OFFENSIVE"?

03:05.966 --> 03:06.466
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF

03:06.533 --> 03:07.900
THOSE THINGS.

03:07.966 --> 03:08.966
THAT LOOKS LESS LIKE A ROYAL

03:09.033 --> 03:09.733
VISIT AND MORE LIKE "BEACH

03:09.800 --> 03:10.466
BARBECUE NIGHT AT SANDALS

03:10.533 --> 03:12.966
BELIZE" BUT IT'S TRUE THAT THIS

03:13.033 --> 03:14.266
TOUR WAS FOR TWO KEY REASONS.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.600
FIRST, TO CELEBRATE

03:15.666 --> 03:17.266
THE QUEEN'S 70 YEARS IN POWER,

03:17.333 --> 03:18.266
A MILESTONE SHE'S DEFINITELY

03:18.333 --> 03:19.500
HIT, BECAUSE SHE'S ABSOLUTELY

03:19.566 --> 03:21.166
NOT DEAD RIGHT NOW.

03:21.233 --> 03:22.466
NOPE.

03:22.533 --> 03:23.466
DON'T DO THE DATES.

03:23.533 --> 03:24.733
DON'T DO THE DATES YET.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.666
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WHEN SHE'S

03:25.733 --> 03:28.200
SO OBVIOUSLY FINE?

03:28.266 --> 03:29.066
BUT SECOND, THIS WAS A CLEAR

03:29.133 --> 03:29.766
ATTEMPT TO TRY AND KEEP THE

03:29.833 --> 03:31.000
COMMONWEALTH TOGETHER,

03:31.066 --> 03:32.033
ESPECIALLY AS JUST FOUR MONTHS

03:32.100 --> 03:33.700
AGO, BARBADOS FORMALLY REMOVED

03:33.766 --> 03:35.566
THE QUEEN AS THEIR HEAD OF STATE

03:35.633 --> 03:36.500
AND, DURING THE SAME CEREMONY,

03:36.566 --> 03:38.566
RECOGNIZED RIHANNA

03:38.633 --> 03:40.300
AS A NATIONAL HERO,

03:40.366 --> 03:41.633
PROVING BARBADOS IS CURRENTLY

03:41.700 --> 03:45.266
MAKING ALL THE RIGHT DECISIONS.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.466
BUT INSTEAD OF THE FAWNING

03:46.533 --> 03:47.700
COVERAGE THE ROYALS NO DOUBT

03:47.766 --> 03:48.533
HOPED FOR, THIS TOUR HAS BEEN

03:48.600 --> 03:51.366
A DISASTER.

03:51.433 --> 03:52.200
>> NOT QUITE THE WELCOME

03:52.266 --> 03:55.033
THEY WERE HOPING FOR.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.666
AT ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES

03:56.733 --> 03:58.066
WILLIAM AND KATE WERE SUPPOSED

03:58.133 --> 03:59.366
TO VISIT, PROTESTS FORCED

03:59.433 --> 04:01.966
THE COUPLE TO CANCEL.

04:02.033 --> 04:02.766
YEAH, THAT WAS THE

04:02.833 --> 04:05.466
FIRST STOP OF DAY ONE.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.133
NOT A GREAT SIGNAL

04:06.200 --> 04:07.733
FOR THE REST OF YOUR TRIP.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.433
IT'S LIKE GETTING TO DISNEY

04:08.500 --> 04:09.333
WORLD AND IMMEDIATELY BEING

04:09.400 --> 04:10.733
TOLD, "SORRY, THEME PARK'S

04:10.800 --> 04:11.933
CLOSED TO YOU BECAUSE YOUR

04:12.000 --> 04:14.100
FAMILY COMMITTED GENOCIDE."

04:14.166 --> 04:14.800
THAT'S GOING TO SET A TONE

04:14.866 --> 04:15.566
FOR THE REST OF YOUR TIME

04:15.633 --> 04:17.066
IN ORLANDO.

04:17.133 --> 04:18.466
AND THINGS DIDN'T GET MUCH

04:18.533 --> 04:19.133
BETTER FROM THERE.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.566
BEFORE THEY EVEN LANDED IN THE

04:20.633 --> 04:21.800
BAHAMAS, THE NATIONAL

04:21.866 --> 04:22.966
REPARATIONS COMMITTEE THERE

04:23.033 --> 04:24.266
RELEASED A STATEMENT, SAYING,

04:24.333 --> 04:25.166
"THE TIME IS NOW FOR

04:25.233 --> 04:26.533
REPARATIONS," ENDING THE LETTER

04:26.600 --> 04:28.366
QUOTING BAHAMIAN ARTIST TONY

04:28.433 --> 04:29.600
McKAY, SAYING, "I COME TO

04:29.666 --> 04:31.200
COLLECT EVERYTHING

04:31.266 --> 04:32.900
THAT YOU OWE ME."

04:32.966 --> 04:34.333
WHICH IS A DEVASTATING WAY

04:34.400 --> 04:35.766
TO END A LETTER.

04:35.833 --> 04:36.400
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE

04:36.466 --> 04:38.433
MADE IT ANY MORE DEVASTATING IS

04:38.500 --> 04:40.133
SIMPLY ADDING THE WORD "BITCH."

04:40.200 --> 04:42.633
I MEAN, THE "BITCH" IS IMPLIED.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.366
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

04:44.433 --> 04:45.233
BUT IT'D BE LOVELY TO SEE IT

04:45.300 --> 04:46.400
WRITTEN DOWN.

04:46.466 --> 04:47.933
AND THEN THERE WAS JAMAICA,

04:48.000 --> 04:48.500
WHERE THINGS CONTINUED GOING

04:48.566 --> 04:49.600
BADLY.

04:49.666 --> 04:50.933
PROTESTORS DEMANDED AN APOLOGY

04:51.000 --> 04:52.300
FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY'S ROLE IN

04:52.366 --> 04:53.600
THE SLAVE TRADE AND MADE SOME

04:53.666 --> 04:55.900
PRETTY POINTED CRITICISMS.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.866
>> MR. WILLIAM, I SEE YOU LOVE

04:57.933 --> 05:00.333
TO DANCE WITH THE BLACK PEOPLE

05:00.400 --> 05:04.300
AND YOU LOVE TO FROLIC,

05:04.366 --> 05:05.933
BUT SPEAK SOME TRUTH

05:06.000 --> 05:07.366
ON THIS TRIP.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.000
>> OUR GOAL IS TO LOOSEN AND

05:09.066 --> 05:10.366
REMOVE THE HANDS, THE GLOVED

05:10.433 --> 05:14.533
HANDS OF THE QUEEN FROM AROUND

05:14.600 --> 05:15.100
OUR NECKS

05:15.166 --> 05:16.366
SO THAT WE CAN BREATHE.

05:16.433 --> 05:17.600
>> HOW ARE THESE TWO YOUNG

05:17.666 --> 05:18.733
WHITE PEOPLE NOW, GOING TO BE

05:18.800 --> 05:20.600
HERE SAYING WE ARE GOING TO

05:20.666 --> 05:22.000
KOWTOW TO THEM AND WE ARE GOING

05:22.066 --> 05:23.600
TO BEND AND BOW

05:23.666 --> 05:25.033
AND KNEEL TO THEM AS IF

05:25.100 --> 05:26.533
THEY ARE GODS?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.200
THOSE DAYS ARE DONE.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.500
THE MONARCHY IS A RELIC.

05:29.566 --> 05:30.733
HOLY SHIT.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.633
WILLIAM, KATE.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.466
JUST GO.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.100
YOU JUST GOTTA LEAVE.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.366
IF ALL THOSE BLACK WOMEN HAVE

05:35.433 --> 05:36.600
TAKEN TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY TO

05:36.666 --> 05:38.366
CALL YOU "MR. WILLIAM" AND

05:38.433 --> 05:39.466
"THOSE TWO YOUNG WHITE PEOPLE,"

05:39.533 --> 05:40.366
YOU'RE DONE.

05:40.433 --> 05:41.500
YOU'RE JUST DONE.

05:41.566 --> 05:42.366
IT IS OVER FOR YOU.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.800
ALL OF IT.

05:43.866 --> 05:44.900
HAVING YOUR ENTIRE THING IN LIFE

05:44.966 --> 05:46.900
REDUCED DOWN TO "YOU LOVE

05:46.966 --> 05:50.233
TO FROLIC" IS FUCKING BRUTAL.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.266
THE PEOPLE OF JAMAICA HAVE SAID,

05:51.333 --> 05:52.166
"THESE TWO WHITE PEOPLE ARE

05:52.233 --> 05:52.866
UNSERIOUS, AND WE DO NOT REQUIRE

05:52.933 --> 05:54.066
THEM.

05:54.133 --> 05:55.733
PLEASE GO FROLIC SOMEWHERE ELSE"

05:55.800 --> 05:56.966
AND I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH THEM.

05:57.033 --> 05:58.600
AND LOOK, WILLIAM AND KATE

05:58.666 --> 06:00.166
TRIED TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

06:00.233 --> 06:01.666
THEY PLAYED SOME BONGOS,

06:01.733 --> 06:02.700
THEY SAT IN

06:02.766 --> 06:05.266
A JAMAICAN BOBSLED, AND POSED

06:05.333 --> 06:06.600
NEXT TO A BOB MARLEY STATUE,

06:06.666 --> 06:07.633
WHILE SOMEHOW MANAGING TO LOOK

06:07.700 --> 06:08.700
MORE LIFELESS THAN AN ACTUAL

06:08.766 --> 06:11.100
STATUE.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.333
BUT IT ALL FELT DESPERATE.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.966
AND PERHAPS THEIR LOWEST MOMENT

06:14.033 --> 06:15.033
CAME DURING THEIR AUDIENCE WITH

06:15.100 --> 06:15.900
THE JAMAICAN PRIME MINISTER,

06:15.966 --> 06:16.833
BECAUSE AS HE WELCOMED THEM IN

06:16.900 --> 06:18.766
FOR THEIR INITIAL PHOTO OP,

06:18.833 --> 06:20.066
BEFORE THE CAMERAS HAD EVEN GOT

06:20.133 --> 06:21.000
SETTLED, HE DROPPED THIS

06:21.066 --> 06:23.000
ON THEM.

06:23.066 --> 06:25.700
>> JAMAICA IS, AS YOU WOULD SEE,

06:25.766 --> 06:28.333
A COUNTRY THAT IS VERY PROUD OF

06:28.400 --> 06:30.166
OUR HISTORY AND VERY PROUD OF

06:30.233 --> 06:32.500
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED.

06:32.566 --> 06:36.233
WE ARE MOVING ON AND WE INTEND

06:36.300 --> 06:45.866
TO ATTAIN IT IN SHORT ORDER.

06:45.933 --> 06:47.033
AND FULFILL OUR TRUE AMBITIONS

06:47.100 --> 06:48.100
AS AN INDEPENDENT,

06:48.166 --> 06:50.866
DEVELOPED, PROSPEROUS COUNTRY.

06:50.933 --> 06:52.766
OH, SHIT!

06:52.833 --> 06:53.966
HE BASICALLY BROKE UP WITH THEM

06:54.033 --> 06:55.800
BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN SIT DOWN.

06:55.866 --> 06:56.433
THEY DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE

06:56.500 --> 06:59.000
CHAIRS.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.133
IT'S HARD TO WATCH THAT WITHOUT

07:00.200 --> 07:01.166
GETTING FLASHBACKS TO EVERY TIME

07:01.233 --> 07:03.066
YOU'VE BEEN DUMPED.

07:03.133 --> 07:04.766
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU NEED TO BREAK

07:04.833 --> 07:06.200
UP WITH SOMEONE, YOU SHOULD

07:06.266 --> 07:08.100
DEFINITELY DO IT LIKE THAT.

07:08.166 --> 07:08.566
"I'M SORRY, MICHELLE.

07:08.633 --> 07:09.400
BEFORE WE EAT, I JUST WANT TO

07:09.466 --> 07:10.433
SAY I'M VERY PROUD OF OUR

07:10.500 --> 07:11.766
HISTORY AND WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED

07:11.833 --> 07:12.866
TOGETHER, BUT I'M MOVING ON

07:12.933 --> 07:14.066
AND INTEND TO FULFILL

07:14.133 --> 07:15.566
MY AMBITIONS AS AN INDEPENDENT,

07:15.633 --> 07:18.066
DEVELOPED, PROSPEROUS PERSON.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.166
ALSO, I HATE EVERY ONE OF YOUR

07:20.233 --> 07:22.066
FRIENDS AND I ALWAYS HAVE."

07:22.133 --> 07:25.200
THERE WERE SO MANY POINTS THIS

07:25.266 --> 07:25.900
TRIP THAT IT SHOULD'VE BEEN

07:25.966 --> 07:27.033
ABANDONED.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.433
HOW DID NO ONE ON IT NOT LOOK

07:28.500 --> 07:32.266
AROUND AND SAY, "NO ONE ASKED US

07:32.333 --> 07:33.566
TO BE HERE, EVERYONE IS FUCKING

07:33.633 --> 07:34.133
MAD AT US, WE SHOULDN'T BE

07:34.200 --> 07:34.666
HERE."

07:34.733 --> 07:35.500
ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, I GUESS

07:35.566 --> 07:36.266
"NO ONE ASKED US TO BE HERE

07:36.333 --> 07:37.100
AND NOW THEY'RE MAD"

07:37.166 --> 07:38.066
IS ESSENTIALLY BRITISH HISTORY

07:38.133 --> 07:42.400
IN TWO SENTENCES.

07:42.466 --> 07:43.700
THE THING, THOUGH, IS, EVEN IF

07:43.766 --> 07:44.400
WILLIAM AND KATE WERE CHARMING,

07:44.466 --> 07:45.433
I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ENOUGH

07:45.500 --> 07:46.433
CHARM IN THE UNIVERSE TO

07:46.500 --> 07:48.033
CONVINCE THESE NATIONS TO STICK

07:48.100 --> 07:50.233
WITH THE MONARCHY.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.100
THIS IS AN EMPIRE THAT INVADED

07:51.166 --> 07:52.100
THEIR LANDS, ROBBED THEIR

07:52.166 --> 07:53.533
WEALTH, AND ENSLAVED AND

07:53.600 --> 07:55.166
MURDERED THEIR PEOPLE, AND NOW

07:55.233 --> 07:56.433
THE ROYALS HAVE THE

07:56.500 --> 07:58.333
FUCKING BALLS TO ASK, "CAN YOU

07:58.400 --> 08:01.233
PLEASE KEEP US AROUND?"

08:01.300 --> 08:02.500
THAT HAS TO BE THE SINGLE

08:02.566 --> 08:03.633
DUMBEST QUESTION I'VE EVER HEARD

08:03.700 --> 08:05.233
IN MY LIFE.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.366
ASIDE, MAYBE, FROM THIS.

08:07.433 --> 08:08.966
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS BOOK

08:09.033 --> 08:10.066
THAT IS BEING TAUGHT WITH KIDS

08:10.133 --> 08:11.466
THAT BABIES ARE RACIST?

08:11.533 --> 08:12.533
EXACTLY.

08:12.600 --> 08:17.800
AND NOW THIS.

08:17.866 --> 08:20.500
AND NOW YET

08:20.566 --> 08:21.933
ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF COMING UP

08:22.000 --> 08:26.633
ON "INSIDE EDITION."

08:26.700 --> 08:29.166
>> BUGGING OUT.

08:29.233 --> 08:32.433
THE PRESIDENT ATTACKED BY A

08:32.500 --> 08:32.800
CICADA.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.266
THEN, THE GUY WHO SAYS HE WAS

08:34.333 --> 08:37.266
SWALLOWED BY A WHALE.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.633
HE SAYS IT'S ALSO HAPPENED TO

08:39.700 --> 08:40.400
HIM.

08:40.466 --> 08:43.233
THEN, BABY DINOSAUR MYSTERY.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.866
AND, YOU CALL THIS LUNCH?

08:44.933 --> 08:47.200
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

08:47.266 --> 08:51.800
THEN, NOT BAD FOR AN OLD MAN.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.033
THEN, STORAGE LOCKERS.

08:53.100 --> 08:53.900
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE

08:54.000 --> 08:55.366
STORING THEIR STUFF IN THEM.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.466
FREAK OUT.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.500
THEN.

09:00.566 --> 09:03.500
THEIR SONG SO BEAUTIFUL.

09:03.566 --> 09:04.366
GATOR GIRL.

09:04.433 --> 09:04.900
WILD-GOOSE CHASE.

09:04.966 --> 09:08.333
>> HAS HE BEEN EATEN BY

09:08.400 --> 09:08.633
ALLIGATORS?

09:08.700 --> 09:11.700
>> THEN, CHIROPRACTORS FOR

09:11.766 --> 09:11.900
BABIES.

09:11.966 --> 09:12.666
CHAMPAGNE WEDDING TOAST.

09:12.733 --> 09:16.900
THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL.

09:16.966 --> 09:17.900
MOVING ON.

09:17.966 --> 09:18.733
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

09:18.800 --> 09:19.400
CONCERNS DRUGS.

09:19.466 --> 09:20.200
THEY'RE SOMETHING WE'VE OFTEN

09:20.266 --> 09:20.766
BEEN TOLD TO AVOID, THROUGH

09:20.833 --> 09:24.033
PSAs LIKE THIS.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.433
>>

09:26.500 --> 09:27.066
>> OH, NO!

09:27.133 --> 09:28.300
>> OH, DON'T YOU DO IT NOW!

09:30.066 --> 09:33.866
>> OH, NO!

09:34.600 --> 09:36.233
FOR A FOOL WHEN THEY SAY,

09:36.733 --> 09:37.900
JUST BE SMART AND HEED THIS

09:42.833 --> 09:43.966
JUST TELL THEM YOU GOT BETTER

09:46.166 --> 09:48.566
COOL.

09:48.633 --> 09:50.166
EVERYONE KNOWS THE HOTTEST SPOT

09:50.233 --> 09:51.533
TO SNORT COKE IS A BENCH

09:51.600 --> 09:52.300
ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET

09:52.366 --> 09:54.133
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.100
THESE DAYS, YOU CAN'T EVEN HANG

09:55.166 --> 09:56.400
OUT ON YOUR SPLIT-LEVEL PORCH IN

09:56.466 --> 09:57.633
YOUR POODLE SKIRT WITHOUT SEEING

09:57.700 --> 09:58.866
THOSE PESKY TEENS, BLOWING THAT

09:58.933 --> 10:01.500
SNOW LIKE IT'S JACKSON HOLE.

10:01.566 --> 10:02.233
BUT DESPITE THOSE VERY

10:02.300 --> 10:03.333
COMPELLING ARGUMENTS, MILLIONS

10:03.400 --> 10:04.800
UPON MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STILL

10:04.866 --> 10:07.000
USE ILLICIT DRUGS.

10:07.066 --> 10:08.566
AND IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY.

10:08.633 --> 10:11.000
DRUGS CAN BE A LOT OF FUN.

10:11.066 --> 10:12.200
SOME, IN FACT, CAN BE SO MUCH

10:12.266 --> 10:12.933
FUN THEY END UP RUINING YOUR

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
FUCKING LIFE.

10:14.066 --> 10:15.500
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, THAT

10:15.566 --> 10:17.566
"GREASE" FEVER DREAM ISN'T WRONG

10:17.633 --> 10:19.200
TO IMPLY ENGAGING WITH THE

10:19.266 --> 10:19.933
ILLICIT DRUG SUPPLY

10:20.000 --> 10:22.533
CAN BE DANGEROUS.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.100
THIS PAST DECADE HAS SHOWN

10:24.166 --> 10:25.766
A SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN OVERDOSE

10:25.833 --> 10:26.333
DEATHS, LEADING TO ALARMING

10:26.400 --> 10:28.600
STATISTICS LIKE THIS.

10:28.666 --> 10:31.066
>> THE CDC ESTIMATES MORE THAN

10:31.133 --> 10:32.866
100,000 AMERICANS DIED FROM DRUG

10:32.933 --> 10:35.366
OVERDOSES OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD

10:35.433 --> 10:37.266
ENDING THIS APRIL, A RECORD.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.333
THAT'S NEARLY THREE TIMES

10:38.400 --> 10:38.966
THE NUMBER OF DEATHS

10:39.033 --> 10:40.866
FROM TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS LAST

10:40.933 --> 10:42.400
YEAR AND MORE THAN TWICE THE

10:42.466 --> 10:44.333
NUMBER OF GUN DEATHS.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.033
WOW.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.333
THAT IS STAGGERING.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.033
AND QUICK SIDE NOTE.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.166
IT'S DEPRESSINGLY AMERICAN TO BE

10:49.233 --> 10:51.066
SHOCKED THAT SOMETHING COULD

10:51.133 --> 10:53.600
CAUSE MORE DEATHS THAN GUNS.

10:53.666 --> 10:54.966
WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT

10:55.033 --> 10:56.100
WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND SAY,

10:56.166 --> 10:57.900
"IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT DRUG

10:57.966 --> 10:58.800
OVERDOSES ARE KILLING MORE

10:58.866 --> 10:59.866
PEOPLE THAN ONE OF THOSE NATURAL

10:59.933 --> 11:00.900
CAUSES OF DEATH,

11:00.966 --> 11:02.766
HIGHLY PREVENTABLE LOSS OF LIFE

11:02.833 --> 11:05.233
BY LOOSELY REGULATED WEAPONS."

11:05.300 --> 11:06.500
STREET DRUGS ARE

11:06.566 --> 11:08.433
AN ABSOLUTE MESS RIGHT NOW, AS

11:08.500 --> 11:09.866
THEY'VE BECOME SO CONTAMINATED,

11:09.933 --> 11:10.933
ONE YALE RESEARCHER SAID

11:11.000 --> 11:11.833
THE WHOLE SUPPLY IS JUST SO

11:11.900 --> 11:13.500
ABSOLUTELY FUCKED

11:13.566 --> 11:17.733
AT THIS POINT.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.900
AND THE RISE IN OVERDOSES DEATHS

11:18.966 --> 11:20.233
HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE PRESENCE

11:21.933 --> 11:22.600
AND THAT IS FENTANYL.

11:22.666 --> 11:23.866
A SYNTHETIC OPIOID OFTEN USED

11:23.933 --> 11:24.633
PRESCRIPTIVELY FOR THINGS LIKE

11:24.700 --> 11:25.566
SURGERIES OR CANCER PAIN.

11:25.633 --> 11:28.133
BUT OUTSIDE OF MEDICAL SETTINGS,

11:28.200 --> 11:29.666
ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURED FENTANYL

11:29.733 --> 11:32.400
HAS BECOME A HUGE PROBLEM.

11:32.466 --> 11:33.933
BECAUSE IT AND OTHER SYNTHETIC

11:34.000 --> 11:35.166
OPIOIDS WERE INVOLVED IN NEARLY

11:35.233 --> 11:36.433
TWO-THIRDS OF ALL OVERDOSE

11:36.500 --> 11:38.700
DEATHS DURING THE PAST YEAR.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.066
AND WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT

11:40.133 --> 11:41.733
FENTANYL IS INCREDIBLY POTENT,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.966
THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT

11:44.033 --> 11:45.200
THERE'S A DANGEROUS LACK OF

11:45.266 --> 11:46.200
CONSISTENCY IN THE WAY IT'S

11:46.266 --> 11:47.400
CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE

11:47.466 --> 11:49.433
STREET DRUG SUPPLY.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.133
SO YOU CAN EITHER KNOW YOU'RE

11:51.200 --> 11:52.400
TAKING IT ON ITS OWN OR IN

11:52.466 --> 11:54.200
SOMETHING LIKE HEROIN BUT NOT

11:54.266 --> 11:54.833
KNOW HOW POTENT WHAT YOU'RE

11:54.900 --> 11:58.100
TAKING IS.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.333
OR YOU MAY NOT KNOW YOU'RE

11:59.400 --> 12:00.200
TAKING IT AT ALL.

12:00.266 --> 12:02.166
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT

12:02.233 --> 12:03.666
THIS OPIOID IS BEING FOUND

12:03.733 --> 12:05.833
IN A CONTAMINATED PILL SUPPLY

12:05.900 --> 12:07.433
IN THE WHOLE UNITED STATES.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.833
THEY'RE USING PILL PRESSES

12:09.900 --> 12:11.666
THAT LOOK LIKE PILLS FOR

12:11.733 --> 12:12.633
PHARMACEUTICALS THAT ARE

12:12.700 --> 12:13.933
CURRENTLY MARKETED.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.033
>> ONE DAY, I ADMITTED THREE

12:15.100 --> 12:16.233
PEOPLE INTO THE CLINIC.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.366
ALL THREE OF THEM SAID

12:17.433 --> 12:18.800
THEY WERE TAKING OXYCODONE.

12:18.866 --> 12:20.266
NONE OF THOSE THREE PEOPLE HAD

12:20.333 --> 12:21.966
ANY OXYCODONE TESTED IN THEIR

12:22.033 --> 12:24.000
URINE THAT WE TESTED THAT DAY.

12:24.066 --> 12:27.800
IT WAS ALL FENTANYL.

12:27.866 --> 12:28.600
WELL, THAT'S NOT GREAT,

12:28.666 --> 12:29.333
IS IT?

12:29.400 --> 12:30.333
THE ONLY TIME YOU SHOULD BE

12:30.400 --> 12:31.833
SURPRISED BY WHAT'S IN YOUR

12:31.900 --> 12:34.233
URINE IS WHEN YOU FORGOT YOU ATE

12:34.300 --> 12:35.866
ASPARAGUS EARLIER THAT DAY OR,

12:35.933 --> 12:38.366
WORST CASE SCENARIO, THE SHRUNK

12:38.433 --> 12:39.500
DOWN MAGIC SCHOOL BUS COMES OUT

12:39.566 --> 12:39.966
AFTER A BIOLOGY LESSON

12:40.033 --> 12:41.600
GONE HORRIBLY WRONG.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.166
SO IF THE CURRENT DRUG SUPPLY

12:43.233 --> 12:44.133
IS THIS TAINTED AND THIS

12:44.200 --> 12:45.766
DANGEROUS, WE THOUGHT TONIGHT

12:45.833 --> 12:47.300
IT'D BE WORTH TALKING ABOUT THE

12:47.366 --> 12:51.700
OVERDOSES IT CAN CAUSE, AND THE

12:51.766 --> 12:52.866
THINGS WE SHOULD AND REALLY

12:52.933 --> 12:53.633
SHOULDN'T BE DOING TO PREVENT

12:53.700 --> 12:54.166
THEM.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.433
AND LET'S START BY ACKNOWLEDGING

12:55.500 --> 12:56.133
SOME PAST MISTAKES.

12:56.200 --> 12:56.766
BECAUSE FOR DECADES, WE'VE BEEN

12:56.833 --> 12:57.400
FIGHTING A WAR ON DRUGS THAT WAS

12:57.466 --> 12:58.133
OFTEN FUELED BY FEAR AND

12:58.200 --> 12:59.366
MISINFORMATION, DIRECTLY LEADING

12:59.433 --> 13:02.266
TO BAD POLICY.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.700
IN THE '80s, FOR INSTANCE,

13:03.766 --> 13:04.366
THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CRACK

13:04.433 --> 13:06.100
COCAINE USE, WHICH WERE VERY

13:06.166 --> 13:08.200
REAL, GOT CARTOONISHLY

13:08.266 --> 13:10.433
INFLATED INTO FEARMONGERING

13:10.500 --> 13:13.500
HEADLINES ABOUT A GENERATION OF

13:13.566 --> 13:16.166
CRACK BABIES WITH STORIES LIKE,

13:16.233 --> 13:17.733
"CRACK BABIES TURN 5

13:17.800 --> 13:18.666
AND SCHOOLS BRACE," WHICH WAS

13:18.733 --> 13:20.100
OBVIOUSLY SHITTY AND RACIST AT

13:20.166 --> 13:20.733
THE TIME BUT HAS ALSO SINCE

13:20.800 --> 13:22.300
BEEN COMPLETELY DEBUNKED.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.966
BUT THAT HYSTERIA LED TO

13:24.033 --> 13:25.633
POLICIES LIKE MANDATORY MINIMUMS

13:25.700 --> 13:27.666
THAT FUELED MASS INCARCERATION,

13:27.733 --> 13:28.633
AND LAWS THAT CRIMINALIZED

13:28.700 --> 13:30.400
EVERYTHING SURROUNDING DRUG USE,

13:30.466 --> 13:32.166
FROM PARAPHERNALIA TO EVEN

13:32.233 --> 13:34.466
LOCATIONS WHERE DRUGS WERE USED.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.333
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE SEEING

13:36.400 --> 13:38.466
A SIMILAR PANIC TODAY BREWING

13:38.533 --> 13:40.333
AROUND FENTANYL, WHICH, AGAIN,

13:40.400 --> 13:41.266
IS DANGEROUS IF INGESTED

13:41.333 --> 13:42.666
OR INJECTED.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.533
BUT TO HEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT TELL

13:44.600 --> 13:45.133
IT, IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS TO BE

13:45.200 --> 13:46.400
ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

13:46.466 --> 13:47.233
TAKE THIS VIDEO FROM

13:47.300 --> 13:48.766
THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S

13:48.833 --> 13:50.100
DEPARTMENT, AND BEFORE I SHOW

13:50.166 --> 13:51.300
IT TO YOU, JUST KNOW THE OFFICER

13:51.366 --> 13:53.533
INVOLVED HERE IS COMPLETELY

13:53.600 --> 13:54.400
FINE, FOR REASONS I'LL GET TO IN

13:54.466 --> 13:56.000
A MINUTE.

13:56.066 --> 13:59.100
>> MY TRAINEE WAS EXPOSED TO

13:59.166 --> 14:02.166
FENTANYL AND NEARLY DIED.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.800
HE FOUND A WHITE SUBSTANCE

14:03.866 --> 14:06.433
THAT HE SUSPECTED WAS DRUGS.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.000
>> IT TESTED POSITIVE

14:07.066 --> 14:08.766
FOR FENTANYL.

14:08.833 --> 14:09.866
THAT STUFF'S NO JOKE.

14:09.933 --> 14:10.633
IT IS SUPER DANGEROUS.

14:10.700 --> 14:11.766
>> A COUPLE SECONDS LATER,

14:11.833 --> 14:12.833
HE TOOK SOME STEPS BACK

14:12.900 --> 14:14.800
AND HE COLLAPSED.

14:14.866 --> 14:15.266
AGAIN...

14:15.333 --> 14:16.133
DON'T WORRY.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.900
THAT OFFICER IS COMPLETELY FINE.

14:17.966 --> 14:18.533
AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FEW

14:18.600 --> 14:19.966
IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS THERE;

14:20.033 --> 14:21.300
NOT ONLY DID THE DEPARTMENT

14:21.366 --> 14:22.800
VOLUNTARILY RELEASE THAT BODY

14:22.866 --> 14:24.833
CAM FOOTAGE, THEY ALSO WENT TO

14:24.900 --> 14:26.066
THE TROUBLE OF SCORING IT WITH

14:26.133 --> 14:27.100
MUSIC THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED

14:27.166 --> 14:29.966
AS "FUNERAL HOME SLIDESHOW."

14:30.033 --> 14:31.733
BUT THE IDEA THAT OFFICER

14:31.800 --> 14:33.033
COULD'VE BEEN PASSIVELY EXPOSED

14:33.100 --> 14:35.066
TO FENTANYL AND THEN OVERDOSED

14:35.133 --> 14:37.066
IS COMPLETELY ABSURD.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.733
EXPERTS SAY IT IS TECHNICALLY

14:38.800 --> 14:40.900
IMPOSSIBLE TO TOUCH FENTANYL

14:40.966 --> 14:42.633
POWDER AND FEEL ANY EFFECTS FROM

14:42.700 --> 14:45.533
IT, LET ALONE OVERDOSE AND "YOU

14:45.600 --> 14:46.366
WOULD HAVE TO BE IN SOME SORT OF

14:46.433 --> 14:47.866
WIND TUNNEL WITH MASSIVE AMOUNTS

14:47.933 --> 14:50.533
OF FENTANYL" TO ACCIDENTALLY

14:50.600 --> 14:51.266
INHALE ENOUGH TO O.D.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.633
"A WIND TUNNEL FULL OF FENTANYL"

14:55.700 --> 14:56.466
IS QUITE THE PHRASE THERE.

14:56.533 --> 14:57.466
IF YOU JUST ADD "AND ROVING

14:57.533 --> 14:58.100
GANGS," YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT

14:58.166 --> 14:58.933
HOW A RACIST UNCLE DESCRIBES

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
CHICAGO AFTER WATCHING

15:00.066 --> 15:05.800
TOO MUCH FOX NEWS.

15:05.866 --> 15:08.133
AND THE THINGS IS IT'S BY NO

15:08.200 --> 15:09.533
MEANS JUST SAN DIEGO

15:09.600 --> 15:10.466
MULTIPLE POLICE

15:10.533 --> 15:11.533
DEPARTMENTS HAVE PUT OUT SIMILAR

15:11.600 --> 15:12.033
CLAIMS OF OD-ING THROUGH

15:12.100 --> 15:12.600
ACCIDENTAL SKIN CONTACT OR

15:12.666 --> 15:13.500
INHALATION, WHICH AGAIN,

15:13.566 --> 15:15.333
IS BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.400
WHAT THOSE OFFICERS WERE MUCH

15:16.466 --> 15:17.400
MORE LIKELY EXPERIENCING WERE

15:17.466 --> 15:18.666
PANIC ATTACKS.

15:18.733 --> 15:19.966
WHICH MAKES SENSE, IN A WAY,

15:20.033 --> 15:20.800
BECAUSE THEY'D JUST BEEN EXPOSED

15:20.866 --> 15:22.133
TO SOMETHING THEY'VE REPEATEDLY

15:22.200 --> 15:24.133
HEARD IS DEADLY TO BE ANYWHERE

15:24.200 --> 15:25.500
NEAR.

15:25.566 --> 15:27.033
THIS HAS NOW BECOME SUCH A

15:27.100 --> 15:28.966
TROPE, IT WAS A PLOT POINT ON

15:29.033 --> 15:29.966
"BLUE BLOODS," WHERE DONNIE

15:30.033 --> 15:31.500
WAHLBERG'S PARTNER BRIEFLY PICKS

15:31.566 --> 15:33.033
UP A TRAY WITH FENTANYL ON IT,

15:33.100 --> 15:35.566
AND THEN THIS HAPPENS.

15:35.633 --> 15:36.133
>> ANY IDEA WHAT SHE

15:36.200 --> 15:37.600
CAME IN CONTACT WITH?

15:37.666 --> 15:38.233
>> SAID SHE GOT

15:38.300 --> 15:39.166
FENTANYL ON HER HANDS.

15:39.233 --> 15:40.366
WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPENING HERE?

15:40.433 --> 15:40.866
SHE WAS FINE ONE SECOND,

15:40.933 --> 15:41.233
THE NEXT MINUTE,

15:41.300 --> 15:42.133
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

15:42.200 --> 15:42.933
>> FENTANYL IS A SYNTHETIC

15:43.000 --> 15:45.133
OPIOID 50 TO 100 TIMES STRONGER

15:45.200 --> 15:46.300
THAN MORPHINE.

15:46.366 --> 15:47.900
THE SLIGHTEST EXPOSURE

15:47.966 --> 15:49.133
CAN TRIGGER AN OVERDOSE.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.166
YEAH, THAT'S COMPLETE

15:51.233 --> 15:53.700
HORSESHIT, NOT THAT YOU'D EXPECT

15:53.766 --> 15:54.300
ANY MORE NUANCE FROM A SHOW

15:54.366 --> 15:55.566
THAT'S BASICALLY ADULT

15:55.633 --> 15:58.266
PAW PATROL.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.900
BUT THE POINT IS, IT'S DEEPLY

16:00.966 --> 16:02.100
IRRESPONSIBLE OF POLICE TO KEEP

16:02.166 --> 16:03.666
PERPETUATING A MEDICAL

16:03.733 --> 16:05.533
IMPOSSIBILITY AND FOR MEDIA

16:05.600 --> 16:07.166
OUTLETS TO KEEP AMPLIFYING IT.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.633
FOR A START, IT MIGHT MAKE

16:08.700 --> 16:09.833
PEOPLE AFRAID TO HELP SOMEONE

16:09.900 --> 16:10.566
THEY SEE EXPERIENCING

16:10.633 --> 16:11.333
AN OVERDOSE.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.066
WHY RISK GIVING SOMEONE CPR

16:13.133 --> 16:14.133
IF THEY MIGHT BE COVERED

16:14.200 --> 16:16.266
IN POWDERED DEATH?

16:16.333 --> 16:18.233
AND ALSO, WHEN YOU TREAT A DRUG

16:18.300 --> 16:20.066
LIKE A BIO WEAPON, YOU JUSTIFY

16:20.133 --> 16:21.300
A PUNITIVE, MILITARIZED RESPONSE

16:21.366 --> 16:22.633
TO IT.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.433
A COUPLE YEARS BACK, A OHIO MAN

16:24.500 --> 16:25.900
RECEIVED ADDITIONAL PRISON TIME

16:25.966 --> 16:26.800
FOR ASSAULT ON A POLICE OFFICER

16:26.866 --> 16:28.666
AFTER OFFICERS SEARCHED HIS CAR

16:28.733 --> 16:30.133
FOR DRUGS AND FOUND POWDER THAT

16:30.200 --> 16:30.600
LATER TESTED POSITIVE

16:30.666 --> 16:31.533
FOR FENTANYL.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.333
THAT EXPOSURE TO FENTANYL

16:33.400 --> 16:36.466
ALONE CONSTITUTED THE ASSAULT.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.700
AND LOOK, IF FENTANYL REALLY

16:38.766 --> 16:41.933
WERE SMALLPOX IN A BOTTLE,

16:42.033 --> 16:43.000
MAYBE IT'D MAKE SENSE FOR TOTAL

16:43.066 --> 16:44.200
ERADICATION TO BE OUR GOAL.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.966
BUT IT ISN'T.

16:46.033 --> 16:46.700
SO IT FRANKLY MAKES MUCH MORE

16:46.766 --> 16:48.600
SENSE TO FOCUS ON HOW TO PROTECT

16:48.666 --> 16:49.900
THOSE GENUINELY AT RISK OF

16:51.266 --> 16:52.900
THAT IS THE PEOPLE TAKING IT.

16:52.966 --> 16:54.166
WHICH IS TO SAY, THE REST OF

16:54.233 --> 16:55.366
THIS PIECE IS GOING TO BE ABOUT

16:55.433 --> 16:56.566
HARM REDUCTION.

16:56.633 --> 16:57.933
ESSENTIALLY, HARM REDUCTION

16:58.000 --> 16:59.933
ACCEPTS THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE

17:00.000 --> 17:01.900
WILL USE ILLEGAL DRUGS AND THAT

17:01.966 --> 17:02.400
SOME EITHER CAN'T

17:02.466 --> 17:04.200
OR DON'T WANT TO STOP.

17:04.266 --> 17:06.066
SO RATHER THAN ARREST THEM,

17:06.133 --> 17:07.533
WE MIGHT BE BETTER OFF TRYING TO

17:07.600 --> 17:09.200
MITIGATE THE DAMAGE DONE.

17:09.266 --> 17:12.166
IT'S A CONCEPT YOU MIGHT BE

17:12.233 --> 17:15.933
FAMILIAR WITH THROUGH THINGS

17:16.000 --> 17:16.966
LIKE SYRINGE SERVICES PROGRAMS

17:17.033 --> 17:17.900
WHICH GIVE PEOPLE CLEAN NEEDLES

17:17.966 --> 17:18.933
AND ARE PROVEN TO MASSIVELY HELP

17:19.000 --> 17:19.533
DRIVE DOWN THE SPREAD OF

17:19.600 --> 17:20.300
DISEASE.

17:20.366 --> 17:21.500
AND RIGHT NOW, IF YOU GENUINELY

17:21.566 --> 17:22.933
WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

17:23.000 --> 17:23.600
OVERDOSES, THERE ARE SOME

17:23.666 --> 17:25.333
IMPORTANT TACTICS WE COULD

17:25.400 --> 17:26.566
ENCOURAGE.

17:26.633 --> 17:27.733
FIRST, THERE'S DRUG CHECKING.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.433
THE SIMPLE ACT OF TESTING DRUGS

17:29.500 --> 17:31.066
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN THEM.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.300
THIS CAN BE DONE THROUGH THINGS

17:32.366 --> 17:33.400
LIKE FENTANYL TESTING STRIPS OR

17:33.466 --> 17:34.933
REAGENT TEST KITS.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.666
THESE ARE VERY VALUABLE TOOLS

17:36.733 --> 17:38.566
TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE, AND YET,

17:38.633 --> 17:40.066
THANKS TO THOSE DRUG-WAR ERA

17:40.133 --> 17:41.166
LAWS ON PARAPHERNALIA

17:41.233 --> 17:43.700
I MENTIONED EARLIER, THEY'RE

17:43.766 --> 17:45.566
TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL IN ALL THESE

17:45.633 --> 17:47.500
STATES, MAKING IT A LIABILITY

17:47.566 --> 17:48.700
TO CARRY THEM, WHICH IS

17:48.766 --> 17:51.133
JUST COMPLETE MADNESS.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.766
NOW, THANKFULLY, SOME STATES

17:52.833 --> 17:53.766
HAVE WRITTEN CARVE-OUTS

17:53.833 --> 17:54.966
FOR SPECIFIC METHODS,

17:55.033 --> 17:56.733
LIKE FENTANYL TESTING STRIPS.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.600
AND OTHERS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO

17:57.666 --> 17:59.266
ENFORCE THEIR STUPID LAWS

17:59.333 --> 18:00.666
CRIMINALIZING THEM.

18:00.733 --> 18:01.800
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH, POLICE

18:01.866 --> 18:03.233
OFFICERS MAY NOT BE AWARE

18:03.300 --> 18:04.400
OR INDEED CARE ABOUT THOSE

18:04.466 --> 18:06.466
CARVE-OUTS AND ARE STILL VERY

18:06.533 --> 18:09.066
MUCH ARRESTING PEOPLE OR USING

18:09.133 --> 18:11.000
THE PRESENCE OF TESTING

18:11.066 --> 18:12.033
EQUIPMENT AS PROBABLE CAUSE FOR

18:12.100 --> 18:13.333
FURTHER SEARCHES.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
AND ALL THIS MEANS PEOPLE ARE

18:14.466 --> 18:16.066
STILL GETTING LOCKED UP BECAUSE

18:16.133 --> 18:17.200
THEY WERE CARRYING A LIFESAVING

18:17.266 --> 18:19.366
TOOL, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS,

18:19.433 --> 18:21.366
BECAUSE IF ANY LIFE-SAVING TOOL

18:21.433 --> 18:22.433
SHOULD BE CRIMINALIZED,

18:22.500 --> 18:23.500
IT OBVIOUSLY SHOULDN'T BE

18:23.566 --> 18:24.833
DRUG CHECKING EQUIPMENT.

18:24.900 --> 18:25.700
IT SHOULD BE

18:25.766 --> 18:27.266
THE HEIMLICH MANEUVER.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.033
I'M SORRY, BUT LET'S GET THIS

18:30.100 --> 18:31.200
VERY CLEAR.

18:31.266 --> 18:33.833
IF YOU SEE ME CHOKING

18:33.900 --> 18:34.900
THAT IS, FRANKLY, NONE OF

18:34.966 --> 18:36.033
YOUR BUSINESS.

18:36.100 --> 18:41.366
IF I DIE, LET ME DIE DOING MY

18:42.633 --> 18:43.333
NOT BEING SURPRISE-HUGGED

18:43.400 --> 18:44.100
BY A STRANGER.

18:44.166 --> 18:44.866
DO NOT TOUCH ME

18:44.933 --> 18:46.333
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.433
THEN THERE'S THE HARM REDUCTION

18:47.500 --> 18:48.100
METHOD YOU'RE PROBABLY ALREADY

18:49.233 --> 18:50.066
THAT IS NALOXONE, ALSO KNOWN

18:50.133 --> 18:51.466
BY THE BRAND NAME NARCAN.

18:51.533 --> 18:52.833
NALOXONE, AS THIS WOMAN

18:52.900 --> 18:54.166
WHO WORKS IN HARM REDUCTION

18:54.233 --> 18:54.800
EXPLAINS, CAN QUICKLY REVERSE

18:54.866 --> 18:59.000
AN OPIOID OVERDOSE.

18:59.066 --> 18:59.966
>> SO PRETEND THAT, LIKE, THIS,

19:00.033 --> 19:00.733
THIS HERE, THIS IS THE

19:00.800 --> 19:01.366
FENTANYL COMING IN YOUR SYSTEM,

19:01.433 --> 19:02.266
RIGHT?

19:02.333 --> 19:03.133
SO WHEN YOU SHOOT SOMEONE UP

19:03.200 --> 19:04.766
WITH NARCAN, IT'S LIKE A WALL

19:04.833 --> 19:06.000
GOES UP AND SO THE FENTANYL HITS

19:06.066 --> 19:06.500
THE WALL, IT CAN'T KEEP

19:06.566 --> 19:07.800
ON GOING.

19:07.866 --> 19:08.800
THE MORE NARCAN YOU PUT INTO THE

19:08.866 --> 19:09.633
SYSTEM, THAT BIGGER THAT WALL

19:09.700 --> 19:10.866
GETS.

19:10.933 --> 19:12.333
>> SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

19:12.400 --> 19:13.566
IS IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE EASY

19:13.633 --> 19:14.533
TO REVERSE AN OVERDOSE?

19:14.600 --> 19:15.733
>> YES, IT IS.

19:15.800 --> 19:16.666
RIGHT,

19:16.733 --> 19:18.200
IT'S INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.

19:18.266 --> 19:19.566
NALOXONE HAS GOT TO BE IN THE

19:19.633 --> 19:21.066
HALL OF FAME FOR ERASING

19:21.133 --> 19:22.800
MISTAKES, UP THERE WITH THE

19:22.866 --> 19:24.200
PENCIL ERASER,

19:24.266 --> 19:25.300
THE CONTROL-Z KEY, AND STARRING

19:25.366 --> 19:27.366
IN "DADDY'S HOME 2."

19:27.433 --> 19:28.666
WHAT A FUN FAMILY!

19:28.733 --> 19:30.300
WHAT A CRANKY DAD!

19:30.366 --> 19:33.000
I WONDER IF THERE ARE ANY FUN

19:33.066 --> 19:35.166
PRANKS OR VOICEMAILS ON THE SET.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.033
I BET THERE WERE.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.100
THE POINT IS, NALOXONE'S

19:38.166 --> 19:38.866
A FUCKING MIRACLE, WHICH IS WHY

19:38.933 --> 19:40.233
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING

19:40.300 --> 19:41.733
THAT THE FDA CURRENTLY HAS IT

19:41.800 --> 19:45.766
UNDER PRESCRIPTION-ONLY STATUS,

19:45.833 --> 19:46.466
SOMETHING EVEN THE AMA HAS

19:46.533 --> 19:47.600
SAID SHOULD BE CHANGED.

19:47.666 --> 19:48.566
AND WHILE EVERY STATE HAS

19:48.633 --> 19:50.000
ADOPTED SOME KIND OF WORKAROUND,

19:50.066 --> 19:51.366
MEANING AN INDIVIDUAL CAN

19:51.433 --> 19:52.133
THEORETICALLY GET IT WITHOUT

19:52.200 --> 19:53.966
SEEING A DOCTOR FIRST,

19:54.033 --> 19:56.166
IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT.

19:56.233 --> 19:58.033
AND FOR COMMUNITY GROUPS WHO

19:58.100 --> 20:00.133
WANT TO BUY IT IN BULK, SO THEY

20:00.200 --> 20:02.100
CAN DISTRIBUTE IT DIRECTLY TO

20:02.166 --> 20:02.700
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT, IT CAN BE

20:02.766 --> 20:04.300
BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

20:04.366 --> 20:06.000
AND LOOK, THERE ARE CERTAIN

20:06.066 --> 20:07.333
THINGS YOU'D WANT TO GO OUT OF

20:07.400 --> 20:08.033
YOUR WAY TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE

20:08.100 --> 20:10.200
FROM HAVING IN THEIR HOMES --

20:10.266 --> 20:11.900
NAZI FLAGS, PET CHIMPS,

20:11.966 --> 20:13.866
A TV PLAYING AN EPISODE OF

20:13.933 --> 20:16.566
"BLUE BLOODS", BUT NARCAN

20:16.633 --> 20:18.000
IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ONE OF THEM.

20:18.066 --> 20:19.233
BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST STEP

20:19.300 --> 20:21.200
WE COULD MAKE HERE IS TO

20:21.266 --> 20:23.000
PROPERLY SUPPORT OVERDOSE

20:23.066 --> 20:24.066
PREVENTION CENTERS, SOMETIMES

20:24.133 --> 20:24.733
CALLED SUPERVISED INJECTION

20:24.800 --> 20:26.433
SITES.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.333
THEY'RE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN

20:27.400 --> 20:28.633
BRING THEIR OWN DRUGS, AND HAVE

20:28.700 --> 20:29.633
ACCESS TO CLEAN SUPPLIES AND

20:29.700 --> 20:33.133
TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN

20:33.200 --> 20:34.266
INTERVENE IN THE EVENT OF AN

20:34.333 --> 20:35.533
OVERDOSE AS WELL AS DIRECT

20:35.600 --> 20:36.300
THEM TOWARD TONS OF OTHER

20:36.366 --> 20:37.600
SERVICES, INCLUDING ADDICTION

20:37.666 --> 20:40.166
TREATMENT, IF THEY SO CHOOSE.

20:40.233 --> 20:43.633
HERE'S A LOOK INSIDE ONE OF

20:43.700 --> 20:44.233
THEM RIGHT HERE

20:44.300 --> 20:45.100
IN NEW YORK CITY.

20:45.166 --> 20:45.766
>> WHEN WE WERE INSIDE,

20:45.833 --> 20:46.433
THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN CLIENTS

20:46.500 --> 20:47.066
USING DRUGS.

20:47.133 --> 20:48.066
>> NO MORE IMPROPERLY DISCARDED

20:48.133 --> 20:48.966
SYRINGES ON THE STREETS,

20:49.033 --> 20:50.100
NEAR OUR SCHOOLS,

20:50.166 --> 20:51.766
IN OUR SUBWAY STATIONS.

20:51.833 --> 20:52.600
YOU WON'T --

20:52.666 --> 20:54.933
YOU FIND WAY LESS --

20:55.000 --> 20:59.600
>> SAFELY, SECURELY.

20:59.666 --> 21:00.533
WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT

21:00.600 --> 21:01.666
OVERDOSING.

21:01.733 --> 21:02.533
>> THE VOICE BEHIND THE DIVIDER

21:02.600 --> 21:04.300
BELONGED TO A MAN NAMED OZ

21:04.366 --> 21:05.800
WHO TOLD US HE'S A MARINE CORPS

21:05.866 --> 21:06.400
VETERAN AND WAS USING HEROIN

21:06.466 --> 21:08.633
AS WE SPOKE.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.166
>> I'VE GOTTEN MORE HELP HERE

21:10.233 --> 21:12.300
THAN I'VE GOTTEN FROM, YOU KNOW,

21:12.366 --> 21:15.033
FROM THE V.A.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.300
WOW, THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

21:16.366 --> 21:17.500
AND I KNOW THAT WE, AS A

21:17.566 --> 21:18.566
SOCIETY, HAVE LEARNED NOT TO

21:18.633 --> 21:20.100
TRUST ANYONE NAMED OZ WHO'S

21:20.166 --> 21:21.366
EITHER YELLING AT YOU FROM

21:21.433 --> 21:23.266
BEHIND A CURTAIN OR TRYING TO

21:23.333 --> 21:23.833
TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING

21:23.900 --> 21:25.300
MEDICAL.

21:25.366 --> 21:26.566
BUT WE SHOULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION

21:26.633 --> 21:28.800
HERE ON BOTH COUNTS BECAUSE THIS

21:28.866 --> 21:29.633
PARTICULAR OZ MAKES A VERY

21:29.700 --> 21:30.666
IMPORTANT POINT.

21:30.733 --> 21:32.133
OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS

21:32.200 --> 21:33.666
PROVIDE CRUCIAL SERVICES

21:33.733 --> 21:34.833
THAT KEEP PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS

21:34.900 --> 21:36.833
AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.066
AND YET, WHENEVER THEY'RE

21:38.133 --> 21:39.400
FLOATED AS AN OPTION,

21:39.466 --> 21:42.100
PEOPLE FREAK THE FUCK OUT.

21:42.166 --> 21:43.266
>> IT'S ACTUALLY A HEROIN

21:43.333 --> 21:44.466
SHOOTING GALLERY, AND THAT'S

21:44.533 --> 21:45.233
REALLY WHAT IT IS.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.100
IT IS A COMMUNITY CENTER

21:47.166 --> 21:48.566
FOR HEROIN ADDICTS TO GO

21:48.633 --> 21:51.266
AND SHOOT UP UNDER SUPERVISION,

21:51.333 --> 21:52.033
WHICH I THINK IS --

21:52.100 --> 21:53.566
IS CRAZY.

21:53.633 --> 21:54.466
>> THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT

21:54.533 --> 21:56.433
OVERDOSES FROM HEROIN IS

21:56.500 --> 21:57.000
TO HAVE PEOPLE STOP DOING

21:57.066 --> 21:58.466
HEROIN.

21:58.533 --> 22:00.666
>> THEY CALLED IT HARM REDUCTION

22:00.733 --> 22:02.066
CENTERS, BUT IN MY WAY

22:02.133 --> 22:05.033
OF THINKIN, IT'S REALLY HARM

22:05.100 --> 22:05.433
ENABLING CENTERS.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.166
>> THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS

22:06.233 --> 22:07.333
TO DEAL WITH THAN, YOU KNOW,

22:07.400 --> 22:07.966
LETTING PEOPLE SHOOT UP

22:08.033 --> 22:09.166
SAFELY.

22:09.233 --> 22:10.466
IT'S JUST LIKE CONDONING

22:10.533 --> 22:11.300
DOING DRUGS.

22:11.366 --> 22:12.333
IT'S LIKE, "WHY DON'T

22:12.400 --> 22:14.000
I GO DO IT?"

22:14.066 --> 22:15.933
OKAY, BUT THAT'S NOT

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
AT ALL WHAT THESE CENTERS

22:17.066 --> 22:17.533
ARE FOR.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.066
THEY'RE NOT FOR THE

22:19.133 --> 22:20.466
HEROIN-CURIOUS TO SAMPLE FLIGHTS

22:20.533 --> 22:23.166
OF SYRINGES LIKE IPAs.

22:23.233 --> 22:24.866
THEY'RE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO

22:24.933 --> 22:27.033
ALREADY USE DRUGS DO SO IN A WAY

22:27.100 --> 22:28.433
THAT WON'T FUCKING KILL THEM.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.900
WE KNOW OVERDOSES OFTEN HAPPEN

22:29.966 --> 22:30.700
WHEN PEOPLE USE DRUGS ALONE,

22:30.766 --> 22:32.166
WITH NO ONE AROUND TO HELP THEM,

22:32.233 --> 22:33.000
AND THESE FACILITIES ARE

22:33.066 --> 22:33.733
DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT

22:33.800 --> 22:36.033
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.533
AND POLITICIANS WHO ACTUALLY

22:37.600 --> 22:38.100
STUDY THESE SITES, LIKE THE

22:38.166 --> 22:38.666
FORMER MAYOR OF ITHACA,

22:38.733 --> 22:42.100
NEW YORK, COME AWAY IMPRESSED.

22:42.166 --> 22:42.700
>> THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT,

22:42.766 --> 22:43.800
I THOUGHT IT SOUNDED LIKE

22:43.866 --> 22:44.566
WE WERE JUST ENABLING PEOPLE

22:44.633 --> 22:47.100
TO USE DRUGS.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.300
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IN THE

22:48.366 --> 22:49.966
PLACES WHERE IT'S WORKED, IN

22:50.033 --> 22:53.433
AUSTRALIA AND EUROPE AND CANADA,

22:53.500 --> 22:57.233
MORE PEOPLE GET OFF OF DRUGS,

22:57.300 --> 22:58.233
PEOPLE WHO USE SUPERVISED

22:58.300 --> 22:59.300
INJECTION ARE 30% MORE LIKELY

22:59.366 --> 23:00.300
TO ENTER INTO TREATMENT,

23:00.366 --> 23:00.866
AND THEY'RE 100% LESS LIKELY

23:00.933 --> 23:02.600
TO DIE.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.633
100%.

23:05.700 --> 23:09.833
NO ONE HAS EVER DIED THERE.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.400
IN FACT, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN

23:11.466 --> 23:12.033
A RECORDED DEATH

23:12.100 --> 23:12.833
IN ANY OVERDOSE PREVENTION

23:12.900 --> 23:13.366
CENTER ON EARTH.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.100
THAT'S INSANE!

23:14.166 --> 23:15.466
PEOPLE DIE EVERYWHERE!

23:15.533 --> 23:16.000
PEOPLE DIE

23:16.066 --> 23:17.866
AT CHUCK E. CHEESE!

23:17.933 --> 23:19.266
ALL THE TIME!

23:19.333 --> 23:20.200
THE BALL PIT THERE IS --

23:20.266 --> 23:21.133
AND THIS IS TRUE --

23:21.200 --> 23:23.133
MOSTLY BONES.

23:23.200 --> 23:23.733
YOU WANT TO KNOW

23:23.800 --> 23:24.833
THAT RAT'S REAL NAME?

23:24.900 --> 23:27.533
IT'S CHARLES "EXECUTION" CHEESE.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.866
AND YET DESPITE THE FACT THAT

23:28.933 --> 23:30.400
CLIP WAS FROM SIX YEARS AGO,

23:30.466 --> 23:31.700
ITHACA STILL DOESN'T HAVE AN

23:31.766 --> 23:33.466
OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTER.

23:33.533 --> 23:34.733
BECAUSE WHEN CITIES FLOAT

23:34.800 --> 23:36.200
OPENING ONE, QUESTIONS AROUND

23:36.266 --> 23:37.500
THEIR MORALITY AND EVEN LEGALITY

23:37.566 --> 23:39.366
MAKE IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.

23:39.433 --> 23:40.466
JUST RECENTLY, AN OPC IN

23:40.533 --> 23:41.833
PHILADELPHIA WAS PREVENTED FROM

23:41.900 --> 23:43.466
OPENING AFTER A THREE-JUDGE

23:43.533 --> 23:45.066
PANEL FOUND IT VIOLATED A

23:45.133 --> 23:46.600
PROVISION IN FEDERAL LAW KNOWN

23:46.666 --> 23:48.500
AS THE "CRACK HOUSE STATUTE,"

23:48.566 --> 23:51.433
WHICH BANS FACILITIES THAT

23:51.500 --> 23:53.533
OPERATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF USING

23:53.600 --> 23:54.266
ILLEGAL DRUGS.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.033
YET ANOTHER 1980s LAW

23:55.100 --> 23:56.300
WE'RE STILL SUFFERING FROM,

23:56.366 --> 23:59.100
WHICH IS JUST INFURIATING.

23:59.166 --> 24:00.133
SO OFTEN, THE PROBLEM FACING ALL

24:00.200 --> 24:00.766
HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS IS THAT

24:00.833 --> 24:02.733
PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY WITH THOSE

24:02.800 --> 24:03.800
WHO USE DRUGS, THEY WANT TO TRY

24:03.866 --> 24:06.366
AND PUNISH THEM INTO ABSTINENCE.

24:06.433 --> 24:07.266
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW

24:07.333 --> 24:09.933
ANY OF THIS WORKS.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.700
AND ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN TRYING

24:11.766 --> 24:12.366
TO TELL US THIS FOR A LONG TIME,

24:12.433 --> 24:13.300
LIKE LOUISE VINCENT, WHO POINTS

24:13.366 --> 24:14.666
OUT THAT FOR DECADES, WE'VE BEEN

24:14.733 --> 24:19.433
GOING AT THIS COMPLETELY WRONG.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.300
>> ALL WE DO IS DISCONNECT

24:20.366 --> 24:21.400
PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES.

24:21.466 --> 24:22.333
SO IF YOU ARE FOUND TO BE

24:22.400 --> 24:23.500
A PERSON WHO USES DRUGS

24:23.566 --> 24:26.200
AND NEEDS HELP, WE START

24:26.266 --> 24:27.033
WITH DISCONNECTING YOU.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.133
AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT

24:28.200 --> 24:29.166
ADDICTION IS THE OPPOSITE

24:29.233 --> 24:32.966
OF CONNECTION.

24:33.033 --> 24:34.133
SO WHAT WE DO IS EVERYTHING

24:34.200 --> 24:35.366
WRONG TO HELP A PERSON.

24:35.433 --> 24:38.100
WE DISCONNECT PEOPLE

24:38.166 --> 24:38.766
FROM THEIR FAMILIES.

24:38.833 --> 24:39.733
WE DISCONNECT PEOPLE

24:39.800 --> 24:40.166
FROM THEIR FRIENDS.

24:40.233 --> 24:41.166
WE ALIENATE PEOPLE FROM WORK.

24:41.233 --> 24:43.533
WE DISCONNECT THEM

24:43.600 --> 24:44.700
FROM COMMUNITY,

24:44.766 --> 24:45.533
AND THEN WE DISCONNECT THEM

24:45.600 --> 24:49.166
FROM THEIR FREEDOM, FINALLY,

24:49.233 --> 24:50.133
AND WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY

24:50.200 --> 24:51.366
HAVE NOTHING LEFT, THEN THEY

24:51.433 --> 24:54.600
WILL USE UNTIL THEY DIE.

24:54.666 --> 24:55.633
RIGHT, WHEN PEOPLE HAVE

24:55.700 --> 24:56.200
NOTHING LEFT, THEY WILL USE

24:56.266 --> 24:57.666
UNTIL THEY DIE.

24:57.733 --> 25:00.133
IT IS FUCKING DARK.

25:00.200 --> 25:00.733
IT'S HORRIBLE, AND RIGHT NOW,

25:00.800 --> 25:01.633
YOU CAN MAKE A PRETTY GOOD CASE

25:01.700 --> 25:02.833
THAT -- DELIBERATE OR NOT --

25:02.900 --> 25:03.800
IT'S THE END-GOAL OF U.S.

25:03.866 --> 25:05.700
PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY.

25:05.766 --> 25:06.500
SO, GIVEN THAT, WHAT DO WE DO

25:06.566 --> 25:09.633
FROM HERE?

25:09.700 --> 25:10.700
WELL, FOR STARTERS, THE FDA

25:10.766 --> 25:11.433
SHOULD REMOVE NALOXONE'S

25:11.500 --> 25:12.033
PRESCRIPTION-ONLY STATUS, AND

25:12.100 --> 25:14.500
THEY SHOULD DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

25:14.566 --> 25:15.866
AND CRUCIALLY, NOT JUST FOR

25:15.933 --> 25:16.433
EXPENSIVE BRAND-NAME NASAL

25:16.500 --> 25:17.166
SPRAYS LIKE NARCAN, BUT FOR

25:17.233 --> 25:20.066
LOW-COST, GENERIC NALOXONE,

25:20.133 --> 25:22.100
WHICH IS THIRTY TIMES CHEAPER.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.933
AS FOR STATE LEGISLATURES,

25:24.000 --> 25:24.500
THEY SHOULD RE-EXAMINE THEIR

25:24.566 --> 25:25.266
PARAPHERNALIA LAWS TO MAKE SURE

25:25.333 --> 25:26.500
PEOPLE AREN'T HELD LIABLE FOR

25:26.566 --> 25:27.800
HOLDING BASIC PROTECTIVE TOOLS

25:27.866 --> 25:31.033
LIKE DRUG TESTING EQUIPMENT.

25:31.100 --> 25:31.766
AND FINALLY, WE NEED A

25:31.833 --> 25:32.366
FULL-THROATED ENDORSEMENT OF

25:32.433 --> 25:33.600
OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS

25:33.666 --> 25:34.366
FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION,

25:34.433 --> 25:35.633
BECAUSE REMEMBER, RIGHT NOW,

25:35.700 --> 25:36.400
AS PHILLY IS FINDING OUT,

25:36.466 --> 25:37.533
THEY'RE ARGUABLY ILLEGAL,

25:37.600 --> 25:41.200
THANKS TO THAT

25:41.266 --> 25:41.966
CRACK HOUSE STATUTE.

25:42.033 --> 25:42.700
NOW, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

25:42.766 --> 25:43.833
COULD INTERVENE HERE, AND TAKE

25:43.900 --> 25:44.700
A STAND IN THEIR FAVOR, WHICH IS

25:44.766 --> 25:48.600
FRANKLY THE VERY LEAST BIDEN

25:48.666 --> 25:49.133
COULD DO.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.100
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WONDERING,

25:50.166 --> 25:50.733
"WHO'S THE GUY WHO AUTHORED THE

25:50.800 --> 25:51.266
CRACK HOUSE LEGISLATION,"

25:51.333 --> 25:54.366
I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YOU.

25:54.433 --> 25:54.933
>> I'M THE GUY WHO AUTHORED

25:55.000 --> 25:56.166
THE CRACK HOUSE LEGISLATION.

25:56.233 --> 25:58.500
OH, THANKS

25:58.566 --> 25:59.333
FOR CLARIFYING, JOE.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.300
NICE LARRY KING COSTUME,

26:00.366 --> 26:01.033
BY THE WAY!

26:01.100 --> 26:02.900
AND LOOK, THIS ADMINISTRATION

26:02.966 --> 26:04.366
HAS DONE SOME REAL GOOD, IN

26:04.433 --> 26:05.766
BEING THE FIRST TO BROADLY

26:05.833 --> 26:06.933
ENDORSE HARM REDUCTION TACTICS.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.733
BUT ADVOCATES SAY MUCH, MUCH

26:08.800 --> 26:10.700
MORE IS NEEDED, INCLUDING MAKING

26:10.766 --> 26:12.500
SURE PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS HAVE A

26:12.566 --> 26:13.933
SEAT AT THE TABLE DURING POLICY

26:14.000 --> 26:15.033
DISCUSSIONS, AND THAT FUNDING

26:15.100 --> 26:16.100
GETS TO COMMUNITY-BASED

26:16.166 --> 26:17.433
ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING THE MOST

26:17.500 --> 26:19.533
SERVICES FOR THEM.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.333
BUT WE ALL NEED TO GET ON BOARD

26:22.400 --> 26:23.033
HERE.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.033
OUR ENGRAINED STIGMAS AROUND

26:24.100 --> 26:28.366
DRUGS AND THE PEOPLE WHO USE

26:28.433 --> 26:29.200
THEM RUN REALLY DEEP.

26:29.266 --> 26:30.166
AND IF WE ACTUALLY WANT TO

26:30.233 --> 26:31.300
MINIMIZE DEATHS AND KEEP PEOPLE

26:31.366 --> 26:31.933
SAFE, THE FACTS POINT IN A VERY

26:32.000 --> 26:33.500
WE NEED TO MEET

26:33.566 --> 26:35.366
PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE, HELP THEM

26:35.433 --> 26:36.666
TRANSITION INTO SAFE DRUG USE TO

26:36.733 --> 26:38.166
STAY ALIVE, AND REMOVE BARRIERS

26:38.233 --> 26:40.500
FOR THOSE SEEKING ADDICTION

26:40.566 --> 26:41.166
TREATMENT.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.266
AND WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO

26:42.333 --> 26:45.433
STOP DOING IS SPREADING

26:45.500 --> 26:46.266
MISINFORMATION AND WAREHOUSING

26:46.333 --> 26:49.300
DRUG USERS IN PRISONS.

26:50.766 --> 26:51.900
IT IS WELL PAST TIME TO START

26:51.966 --> 26:52.666
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE MAN

26:52.733 --> 26:53.866
BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

26:53.933 --> 27:00.000
AND NOW THIS.

27:00.066 --> 27:03.133
I KNOW, STILL OF

27:03.200 --> 27:06.700
COMING UP ON "INSIDE EDITION."

27:06.766 --> 27:08.300
>> PEACOCK INVASION.

27:08.366 --> 27:10.966
>> SOUND LIKE BABIES BEING

27:11.033 --> 27:11.900
TORTURED.

27:11.966 --> 27:15.600
>> THEN, THE BRAZILIAN BUTT

27:15.666 --> 27:15.833
LIFT.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.300
TORTOISE THEFT.

27:17.366 --> 27:19.066
YOU'VE BEEN REPLACED BY A ROBOT

27:19.133 --> 27:20.400
WAITRESS.

27:20.466 --> 27:23.233
THEN, HEY, BUDDY, HOW IS THE

27:23.300 --> 27:23.866
FISHING?

27:23.933 --> 27:24.066
PLUS.

27:24.133 --> 27:26.366
>> 911 BAD HAIRCUT.

27:26.433 --> 27:29.733
>> AND DO FACE COVERINGS PREVENT

27:29.800 --> 27:31.400
WOMEN FROM GETTING CAT CALLS?

27:31.466 --> 27:33.566
>> IS THE BABY IN DANGER?

27:33.633 --> 27:35.766
>> THE WOMAN THEY ARE CALLING

27:35.833 --> 27:38.700
HULU HOOP KAREN.

27:38.766 --> 27:40.600
MASK WARS KAREN.

27:40.666 --> 27:41.533
WHY THESE PEOPLE NAMED KAREN ARE

27:41.600 --> 27:43.300
FED UP.

27:43.366 --> 27:46.466
SUPERMODEL GISELE SAVING THE

27:46.533 --> 27:48.666
TURTLE.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.166
THE LUPE TAYLOR SWIFT PATIENT.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.800
WHOSE DENTIST DOESN'T LIKE

27:51.866 --> 27:52.333
TAYLOR SWIFT.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.666
>> YOU DON'T LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT.

27:53.733 --> 27:57.000
DON'T TOUCH ME.

27:57.066 --> 27:57.633
MOVING ON.

27:57.700 --> 27:58.266
FINALLY TONIGHT, I'D LIKE TO

27:58.333 --> 27:59.000
TALK ABOUT ALASKA.

27:59.066 --> 27:59.733
THE SINGLE BEST PLACE TO SEE

27:59.800 --> 28:00.266
A SALMON JUMPING INTO

28:00.333 --> 28:00.933
A BEAR'S MOUTH, AND,

28:01.000 --> 28:01.433
IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY,

28:01.500 --> 28:02.666
A BEAR JUMPING INTO

28:02.733 --> 28:04.066
A SALMON'S MOUTH.

28:04.133 --> 28:04.700
IT'S RARE, BUT WHEN IT

28:04.766 --> 28:06.400
HAPPENS, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

28:06.466 --> 28:07.366
SPECIFICALLY, I'D LIKE TO TALK

28:07.433 --> 28:08.233
ABOUT ONE OF ALASKA'S GREATEST

28:08.300 --> 28:09.333
THE NENANA ICE

28:09.400 --> 28:11.000
CLASSIC.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.700
IT'S A YEARLY CONTEST YOU MAY

28:12.766 --> 28:13.266
NOT HAVE HEARD OF, BUT IT'S

28:13.333 --> 28:13.866
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S

28:13.933 --> 28:14.666
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

28:14.733 --> 28:16.866
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

28:16.933 --> 28:18.066
>> WITH THE PLACING OF

28:18.133 --> 28:19.366
THE TRIPOD ON THE FROZEN

28:19.433 --> 28:20.566
TANANA RIVER, THE NENANA

28:20.633 --> 28:21.766
ICE CLASSIC IS OFF AND

28:21.833 --> 28:22.933
RUNNING.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.133
THE ICE CLASSIC INVOLVES

28:24.200 --> 28:24.966
GUESSING WHEN THE TRIPOD

28:25.033 --> 28:26.366
CONNECTED TO A CLOCK NEAR THE

28:26.433 --> 28:28.066
RIVERBANK WILL FALL THROUGH THE

28:28.133 --> 28:30.133
MELTING RIVER ICE,

28:30.200 --> 28:31.800
WITH THE CLOSEST GUESS WINNING.

28:31.866 --> 28:33.266
IT'S TRUE.

28:33.333 --> 28:34.266
EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE IN THE

28:34.333 --> 28:35.366
SMALL ALASKAN TOWN OF NENANA PUT

28:35.433 --> 28:36.666
A GIANT WOODEN TRIPOD ON A

28:36.733 --> 28:38.000
FROZEN RIVER AND PLACE BETS ON

28:38.066 --> 28:39.566
EXACTLY WHEN THE ICE WILL MELT

28:39.633 --> 28:40.800
ENOUGH TO BREAK UP, AND THE

28:40.866 --> 28:42.033
TRIPOD FLOATS DOWNSTREAM.

28:42.100 --> 28:42.900
AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,

28:42.966 --> 28:44.333
IF YOU AREN'T

28:44.400 --> 28:45.833
INTRIGUED BY WHAT I JUST SAID,

28:45.900 --> 28:48.866
TURN THIS SHOW OFF RIGHT NOW.

28:48.933 --> 28:49.800
IF YOU JUST HEARD ME DESCRIBE

28:49.866 --> 28:51.000
PEOPLE BETTING ON ICE MELTING

28:51.066 --> 28:51.800
AND DIDN'T THINK, "SOUNDS GREAT,

28:51.866 --> 28:53.566
TELL ME MORE," CHANGE THE

28:53.633 --> 28:55.233
CHANNEL, SHUT YOUR LAPTOP,

28:55.300 --> 28:57.666
CLOSE THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO ON YOUR

28:57.733 --> 28:58.700
PHONE, HIT THE "UNROKU" BUTTON

28:58.766 --> 28:59.866
ON YOUR ROKU -- WHATEVER YOU

28:59.933 --> 29:01.066
HAVE TO DO, JUST GET THIS SHOW

29:01.133 --> 29:02.333
AWAY FROM YOUR FACE.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.566
THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM FOR YOU.

29:03.633 --> 29:04.466
YOU DON'T NEED TO WATCH IT.

29:04.533 --> 29:05.933
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WATCH IT.

29:06.000 --> 29:06.533
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

29:06.600 --> 29:08.633
IN YOUR LIFE.

29:08.700 --> 29:13.533
FUCK OFF!

29:14.766 --> 29:15.933
THE NENANA ICE CLASSIC IS

29:16.000 --> 29:16.566
APPARENTLY ONE OF THE OLDEST

29:16.633 --> 29:17.966
CONTINUOUSLY RUNNING

29:18.033 --> 29:18.566
BETTING EVENTS IN THE UNITED

29:18.633 --> 29:19.000
STATES.

29:19.066 --> 29:20.233
IT OFFICIALLY BEGAN BACK IN

29:20.300 --> 29:20.866
1917, WHEN A HANDFUL OF RAILROAD

29:20.933 --> 29:22.200
ENGINEERS DECIDED TO BET ON THE

29:22.266 --> 29:23.933
ICE BREAKUP TO HELP PASS THE

29:24.000 --> 29:25.766
LONG ALASKAN WINTER.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.166
AND ALREADY, I CAN'T HELP

29:27.233 --> 29:29.133
WONDERING WHAT ELSE DID THEY DO

29:29.200 --> 29:30.133
TO PASS THE TIME BEFORE THEY

29:30.200 --> 29:32.733
CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA?

29:32.800 --> 29:34.033
"LET'S SEE, GUYS, WE PLAYED

29:34.100 --> 29:35.833
CARDS, SANG SONGS, WROTE LETTERS

29:35.900 --> 29:36.700
HOME, DRANK HEAVILY, AND

29:36.766 --> 29:38.466
EXPERIMENTED WITH CANNIBALISM,

29:38.533 --> 29:39.633
BUT WE'VE STILL GOT TWO MONTHS

29:39.700 --> 29:40.533
OF WINTER LEFT.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.700
SO, WHO'S UP FOR BETTING ON WHEN

29:41.766 --> 29:43.933
THAT ICE OVER THERE MELTS?"

29:44.000 --> 29:44.833
IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THEY

29:44.900 --> 29:45.800
DETERMINE THE EXACT MOMENT THE

29:45.866 --> 29:46.433
CONTEST IS OVER, THEY'VE DEVISED

29:46.500 --> 29:49.366
A PRETTY AMAZING SYSTEM.

29:49.433 --> 29:50.900
>> WE HAVE DEVELOPED A MECHANISM

29:50.966 --> 29:52.300
THAT TELLS US WHEN THE TRIPOD

29:52.366 --> 29:54.366
MOVES 100 FEET DOWN THE RIVER.

29:54.433 --> 29:59.766
IT CONSISTS OF PULLEYS, WIRE,

29:59.833 --> 30:02.333
A CLEAVER, TWO DIFFERENT TYPES

30:02.400 --> 30:04.700
OF ROPE -- THERE'S TWISTED POLY

30:04.766 --> 30:08.700
AND THEN THERE'S BRAIDED POLY --

30:08.766 --> 30:10.000
HALF OF A 55-GALLON DRUM

30:10.066 --> 30:12.166
THAT'S FILLED WITH ROCKS,

30:12.233 --> 30:13.500
A CLOTHESLINE, AND THE

30:13.566 --> 30:15.600
SPECIAL CLOCK.

30:15.666 --> 30:17.133
EXCELLENT.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.200
THEY BASICALLY MADE

30:18.266 --> 30:19.566
A RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINE OUT OF

30:19.633 --> 30:20.266
RANDOM ITEMS TO CALL THE

30:20.333 --> 30:21.200
CONTEST.

30:21.266 --> 30:22.133
HONESTLY, I WISH IT WAS EVEN

30:22.200 --> 30:23.366
MORE COMPLICATED.

30:23.433 --> 30:24.766
HOW ABOUT THIS?

30:24.833 --> 30:26.233
WHEN THE TRIPOD HITS

30:26.300 --> 30:27.133
100 FEET DOWNRIVER, IT PULLS

30:27.200 --> 30:27.900
A ROPE THAT RUNS TO THE TOWER,

30:27.966 --> 30:28.566
WHICH IS CONNECTED TO A HOOK

30:28.633 --> 30:29.466
THAT PULLS UP A GARBAGE CAN

30:29.533 --> 30:30.433
FILLED WITH DORITOS, AND THAT

30:30.500 --> 30:32.100
RELEASES A BASKETBALL, WHICH

30:32.166 --> 30:33.300
ROLLS DOWN A WOODEN PLANK AND

30:33.366 --> 30:34.133
PULLS A STRING ATTACHED TO A

30:34.200 --> 30:35.866
PAIR OF SCISSORS, WHICH CUTS A

30:35.933 --> 30:36.466
CLOTHESLINE, WHICH IS TIED

30:36.533 --> 30:38.633
THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY TO THE

30:38.700 --> 30:41.333
BACK OF ROBERT DENIRO'S PANTS

30:41.400 --> 30:42.566
AND IT PULLS HIS PANTS DOWN,

30:42.633 --> 30:43.766
WHICH THEN PULLS ANOTHER STRING

30:43.833 --> 30:45.000
BACK AT THE TOWER THAT TRIPS A

30:45.066 --> 30:46.233
WIRE, WHICH DROPS A SECOND

30:46.300 --> 30:47.500
GARBAGE CAN FILLED WITH

30:47.566 --> 30:48.500
MICROSOFT ZUNES,

30:48.566 --> 30:49.533
WHICH LANDS ON THREE DOZEN EGGS,

30:49.600 --> 30:50.500
AND THE EGG YOLK RUNS DOWN INTO

30:50.566 --> 30:51.133
A FUNNEL THAT FLOWS INTO A CUP,

30:51.200 --> 30:52.366
AND ONCE THE CUP IS FILLED, IT

30:52.433 --> 30:53.933
PUSHES AN AIR PUMP, WHICH FILLS

30:54.000 --> 30:55.233
A BALLOON UNTIL IT POPS, AND THE

30:55.300 --> 30:57.100
BALLOON'S STRING PULLS OPEN A

30:57.166 --> 30:57.966
GATE THAT RELEASES A MARBLE,

30:58.033 --> 30:59.066
WHICH ROLLS DOWN A SPIRAL TRACK

30:59.133 --> 31:01.000
AND THEN HITS A MAN NAMED DOUG

31:01.066 --> 31:01.766
IN THE HEAD, AND THEN DOUG

31:01.833 --> 31:04.533
UNPLUGS THE CLOCK.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.400
IT MIGHT NOT BE AS ACCURATE,

31:06.466 --> 31:08.466
BUT IT'D BE REALLY FUN TO WATCH.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.933
SO, TO RECAP, THE MOMENT THE

31:11.000 --> 31:11.933
TRIPOD FLOATS 100 FEET

31:12.000 --> 31:12.500
DOWNRIVER, THE CLOCK STOPS,

31:12.566 --> 31:13.500
AND THE CONTEST IS OVER.

31:13.566 --> 31:15.366
HERE IS THAT GLORIOUS MOMENT

31:15.433 --> 31:17.600
FROM A PAST YEAR.

31:17.666 --> 31:20.600
>> WHOOOO, BABY!

31:20.666 --> 31:21.933
LOOK AT IT!

31:22.000 --> 31:26.033
LOOK AT IT GO!

31:26.100 --> 31:29.533
>> THE CLOCK HAS STOPPED!

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
>> THE CLOCK HAS STOPPED!

31:31.666 --> 31:33.633
>> WHOOOOOO!

31:33.700 --> 31:34.900
LOOK AT IT GO.

31:34.966 --> 31:36.100
I COULD NOT ASK

31:36.166 --> 31:37.766
FOR A BETTER BREAKUP, BABY.

31:37.833 --> 31:38.733
>> I'VE NEVER WITNESSED

31:38.800 --> 31:39.766
THIS BEFORE.

31:39.833 --> 31:40.766
>> YOU HAVEN'T?

31:40.833 --> 31:41.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:41.566 --> 31:43.933
>> IT'S GOOD.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.566
>> WHOOOOO!

31:48.633 --> 31:49.433
DON'T YOU ENVY THAT

31:49.500 --> 31:50.566
WOMAN?

31:50.633 --> 31:51.833
DON'T YOU ENVY HOW MUCH

31:51.900 --> 31:53.033
UNBRIDLED JOY SHE FELT WATCHING

31:53.100 --> 31:54.833
A GIANT WOODEN TRIPOD FLOAT DOWN

31:54.900 --> 31:56.666
A PARTIALLY FROZEN RIVER?

31:56.733 --> 31:57.533
SHE'S GOT LIFE FIGURED OUT.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.500
WE'RE OVER HERE RUNNING AROUND

31:59.566 --> 32:00.433
LIKE IDIOTS, BEING MISERABLE ALL

32:00.500 --> 32:04.400
THE TIME, WHILE SHE'S UP IN

32:04.466 --> 32:04.966
ALASKA WATCHING ICE MELT AND

32:05.033 --> 32:06.066
EXPERIENCING A LEVEL OF PURE

32:06.133 --> 32:06.933
HAPPINESS THAT THE REST OF US

32:07.000 --> 32:09.100
WILL NEVER FEEL IN OUR LIVES.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.200
THAT WOMAN IS LIVING HER BEST

32:10.266 --> 32:13.866
LIFE, AND WE ARE ALL DIPSHITS.

32:13.933 --> 32:14.766
THE WAY YOU ENTER THE ICE

32:14.833 --> 32:16.066
CLASSIC IS BY FILLING OUT A CARD

32:16.133 --> 32:18.400
WITH YOUR GUESS AND DROPPING IT

32:18.466 --> 32:20.200
OFF WITH THE $2.50 ENTRY FEE,

32:20.266 --> 32:21.633
INTO ONE OF THESE RED ICE

32:21.700 --> 32:23.000
CLASSIC BETTING CANS.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.033
WHICH ARE DELIVERED TO VARIOUS

32:24.100 --> 32:24.666
GAS STATIONS, BARS, AND STORES

32:24.733 --> 32:25.500
ALL OVER ALASKA.

32:25.566 --> 32:27.200
AND EACH YEAR, THEY SELL OVER

32:27.266 --> 32:29.533
A QUARTER MILLION ENTRY TICKETS,

32:29.600 --> 32:30.500
WITH LAST YEAR'S JACKPOT BEING

32:30.566 --> 32:32.966
OVER $230,000.

32:33.033 --> 32:35.066
IT WAS SPLIT BETWEEN

32:35.133 --> 32:36.166
12 WINNERS.

32:36.233 --> 32:37.833
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, HOLD ON.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.066
TWELVE DIFFERENT ENTRIES HAD THE

32:39.133 --> 32:40.800
EXACT DAY, HOUR, AND MINUTE THIS

32:40.866 --> 32:41.400
GIANT WOODEN THING FLOATED 100

32:41.466 --> 32:43.533
FEET DOWNSTREAM?

32:43.600 --> 32:44.666
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY

32:44.733 --> 32:46.966
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.300
KEEP PAYING ATTENTION.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.833
NOW, ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT

32:49.900 --> 32:50.700
IS THAT YOU'RE TECHNICALLY

32:50.766 --> 32:52.533
ALLOWED TO PLACE AS MANY BETS AS

32:52.600 --> 32:53.466
YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU PAY

32:53.533 --> 32:54.500
THE FEE EACH TIME.

32:54.566 --> 32:55.766
AND THE CONTEST ISN'T JUST FUN

32:55.833 --> 32:56.800
FOR EVERYONE WHO TAKES PART.

32:56.866 --> 32:59.033
IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES A VALUABLE

32:59.100 --> 33:01.033
SOURCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE DATA BY

33:01.100 --> 33:02.500
MEASURING THE RIVER ICE BREAKUP

33:02.566 --> 33:04.133
TO THE MINUTE EACH YEAR.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.866
AS ONE CLIMATE SPECIALIST PUT

33:05.933 --> 33:06.833
IT, "IT'S ALMOST AS PERFECT

33:06.900 --> 33:07.500
A CLIMATE RECORD

33:07.566 --> 33:09.633
AS YOU COULD GET."

33:09.700 --> 33:10.833
AND THE FINAL THING YOU SHOULD

33:10.900 --> 33:12.133
KNOW IS THAT PARTICIPATION ISN'T

33:12.200 --> 33:14.566
JUST LIMITED TO ALASKANS.

33:14.633 --> 33:16.366
ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN

33:16.433 --> 33:17.566
APPARENTLY PLACE A BET.

33:17.633 --> 33:18.700
NOW, DUE TO ALASKA GAMING

33:18.766 --> 33:19.733
REGULATIONS, THEY CAN'T

33:19.800 --> 33:21.433
PHYSICALLY MAIL THE TICKETS OUT

33:21.500 --> 33:23.566
TO YOU, BUT YOU CAN MAIL YOUR

33:23.633 --> 33:25.933
LIST OF GUESSES ALONG WITH $2.50

33:26.000 --> 33:27.566
PER GUESS TO THE NENANA ICE

33:27.633 --> 33:28.933
CLASSIC OFFICE, AND THEY WILL

33:29.000 --> 33:29.500
GLADLY FILL OUT THE TICKETS

33:29.566 --> 33:30.166
FOR YOU.

33:30.233 --> 33:31.333
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN

33:31.400 --> 33:31.900
PROBABLY SEE WHERE I'M GOING

33:31.966 --> 33:33.900
WITH THIS, RIGHT?

33:33.966 --> 33:36.233
YOU THINK I'D SPEND 10 MINUTES

33:36.300 --> 33:38.100
TALKING ABOUT THE GREATEST ICE

33:38.166 --> 33:39.166
MELTING CONTEST IN THE WORLD,

33:39.233 --> 33:40.466
THEN SAY "OKAY, GOODNIGHT"

33:40.533 --> 33:42.133
AND END THE SHOW?

33:42.200 --> 33:44.300
NO, THAT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE.

33:44.366 --> 33:45.000
OF COURSE, WE'RE BETTING ON THIS

33:45.066 --> 33:46.733
FUCKING ICE MELTING CONTEST.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.766
OF COURSE WE ARE!

33:48.833 --> 33:50.233
WE DECIDED TO PLACE EXACTLY ONE

33:50.300 --> 33:52.266
BET ON THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION

33:52.333 --> 33:54.533
FOR APRIL 26, 2022,

33:54.600 --> 33:56.466
AT EXACTLY 2:17 P.M.

33:56.533 --> 34:00.833
WHY?

34:00.900 --> 34:01.500
I JUST HAVE A REALLY GOOD

34:01.566 --> 34:01.966
FEELING ABOUT IT.

34:02.033 --> 34:02.966
AND THE TRUTH IS, WE COULD HAVE

34:03.033 --> 34:03.533
PLACED MORE BETS THAN THAT,

34:03.600 --> 34:04.266
BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.366
AT THAT POINT, WHAT WOULD STOP

34:05.433 --> 34:05.966
SOMEONE FROM PLACING BETS FOR

34:06.033 --> 34:07.900
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY FOR

34:07.966 --> 34:09.066
THE ENTIRE MONTH OF APRIL?

34:09.133 --> 34:10.400
THEN IT JUST BECOMES A CONTEST

34:10.466 --> 34:12.033
OF "WHO HAS THE MOST MONEY?"

34:12.100 --> 34:13.000
AND THAT'S ALREADY THE GENERAL

34:13.066 --> 34:15.700
CONTEST FOR LIFE IN AMERICA.

34:15.766 --> 34:16.966
AND INITIALLY, WE WERE GOING TO

34:17.033 --> 34:18.400
MAIL OUR GUESS TO ALASKA.

34:18.466 --> 34:19.133
UNTIL WE REALIZED THAT'S NOT

34:19.200 --> 34:19.733
FULLY ENTERING INTO THE TRUE

34:19.800 --> 34:21.700
SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST.

34:21.766 --> 34:23.933
SO INSTEAD, WE DECIDED LAST WEEK

34:24.000 --> 34:26.033
TO GO ALL THE WAY TO NENANA AND

34:26.100 --> 34:27.566
DROP OFF OUR BET IN ONE OF THOSE

34:27.633 --> 34:28.200
RED CANS.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.533
AND WHEN I SAY "WE," LET ME BE

34:29.600 --> 34:30.400
VERY CLEAR.

34:30.466 --> 34:32.300
I DON'T MEAN ME.

34:32.366 --> 34:34.500
I DID NOT GO TO ALASKA.

34:34.566 --> 34:36.233
YOU REALLY THINK "THIS" COULD

34:36.300 --> 34:38.900
HANDLE A HARSH ALASKAN WINTER?

34:38.966 --> 34:40.033
MY APARTMENT'S THERMOSTAT IS SET

34:40.100 --> 34:42.400
TO "DAINTY BOY."

34:42.466 --> 34:44.400
THANKFULLY, THOUGH, I KNOW

34:44.466 --> 34:45.133
SOMEONE WITH A PERFECT BODY FOR

34:45.200 --> 34:46.266
SUCH AN ADVENTURE.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.066
YOU MAY REMEMBER, SEVERAL YEARS

34:48.133 --> 34:48.633
AGO, IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP

34:48.700 --> 34:49.466
CELEBRATE EARTH DAY, WE

34:49.533 --> 34:52.133
INTRODUCED A NEW MASCOT

34:52.200 --> 34:52.900
MARSHMALLOW, THE POLAR BEAR WITH

34:52.966 --> 34:55.900
A BROKEN PENIS.

34:55.966 --> 34:56.633
NOW, WHY WAS HIS PENIS BROKEN?

34:56.700 --> 34:59.333
I HONESTLY CAN'T REMEMBER,

34:59.400 --> 35:00.100
AND I DOUBT IT REALLY MATTERS.

35:00.166 --> 35:00.966
BUT LONG STORY SHORT, THE

35:01.033 --> 35:01.733
ORGANIZERS OF EARTH DAY REFUSED

35:01.800 --> 35:02.333
TO ADOPT MARSHMALLOW AS THEIR

35:02.400 --> 35:03.600
MASCOT.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.100
SHATTERING HIS HEART, LIKE HIS

35:05.166 --> 35:08.700
PENIS, INTO A THOUSAND PIECES.

35:08.766 --> 35:10.200
AND AS MARSHMALLOW'S BEEN

35:10.266 --> 35:11.400
SITTING AROUND WITH NOTHING TO

35:11.466 --> 35:13.200
DO FOR SEVEN YEARS, HE WAS MORE

35:13.266 --> 35:15.700
THAN HAPPY TO DROP OUR BET OFF

35:15.766 --> 35:16.466
IN PERSON, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT

35:16.533 --> 35:17.000
HE DID.

35:17.066 --> 35:24.466
TAKE A LOOK.

35:24.533 --> 35:27.100
>> THEY SAY THE JOURNEY OF A

35:27.166 --> 35:28.533
THOUSAND MILES STARTS WITH A

35:28.600 --> 35:30.733
SINGLE STEP BUT FOR THIS POLAR

35:30.800 --> 35:32.766
BEAR, IT BEGAN WITH A FOND

35:32.833 --> 35:35.766
FAREWELL TO HIS EMPLOYER.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.600
A 90 MINUTE CAB RIDE TO NEWARK,

35:38.666 --> 35:41.533
VIRTUALLY NO TSA LINE, AND AN

35:41.600 --> 35:42.966
EIGHT-HOUR FLIGHT.

35:43.033 --> 35:45.366
ONCE IN ALASKA, MARSHMALLOW WAS

35:45.433 --> 35:47.366
READY TO GO.

35:47.433 --> 35:47.966
UNFORTUNATELY, HIS LUGGAGE WAS

35:48.033 --> 35:48.833
NOT.

35:48.900 --> 35:55.533
FEELS LIKE THE FISH BACKS ALWAYS

35:55.600 --> 35:57.366
COME OUT LAST.

35:57.433 --> 35:58.333
FUCKING ALASKA AIRLINES.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.933
MARSHMALLOW FACED AN OMEN OF THE

36:00.000 --> 36:00.666
PERILOUS PATH AHEAD.

36:00.733 --> 36:03.766
HERE WAS A FEAT FAR WORSE THAN A

36:03.833 --> 36:06.333
BEING STUCK AT THE

36:06.400 --> 36:08.900
AIRPORT FOREVER.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.400
MARSHMALLOW KNEW THIS JOURNEY

36:10.466 --> 36:12.333
WOULDN'T BE EASY, TREKKING

36:12.400 --> 36:14.433
THROUGH THE VAST ARCTIC EXPANSE

36:14.500 --> 36:17.400
OF SNOW, SUBZERO COLD, AND WINDS

36:17.466 --> 36:19.366
THAT CUT TO THE BONE.

36:19.433 --> 36:21.466
NO ONE SEEMED WILLING TO LEND A

36:21.533 --> 36:24.500
HAND OR EVEN A HORN.

36:24.566 --> 36:27.700
AND WHEN MARSHMALLOWS PAWS TOOK

36:27.766 --> 36:28.866
HIM AS FAR AS THEY COULD GO AND

36:28.933 --> 36:30.966
HE WAS AT HIS PHYSICAL AND

36:31.033 --> 36:33.833
MENTAL LIMITS, HE CALLED ON

36:33.900 --> 36:36.633
ALASKAN UBER.

36:36.700 --> 36:41.333
NOW THAT'S A FIVE STAR RIDE.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.533
SOON HE HAD REACHED HIS

36:43.600 --> 36:44.666
DESTINATION.

36:44.733 --> 36:56.066
NENANA, HOME OF THE ICE CLASSIC.

36:56.133 --> 36:56.700
PLACING A SINGLE BET FOR $2.50

36:56.766 --> 37:01.966
AAND I SMELTING CONTEST.

37:02.033 --> 37:04.900
APRIL 26, 2:17 P.M.

37:04.966 --> 37:07.866
THE WAGER 100% GUARANTEED TO WIN

37:07.933 --> 37:14.366
THIS YEAR'S ICE CLASSIC.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.700
A KIND STRANGER SAID THE NICEST

37:16.766 --> 37:18.566
WORDS ANYONE HAD EVER SAID TO

37:18.633 --> 37:19.200
MARSHMALLOW.

37:19.266 --> 37:20.000
>> THANKS, MARSHMALLOW.

37:20.066 --> 37:23.200
GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND I HOPE YOUR

37:23.266 --> 37:24.400
PENIS FEELS BETTER.

37:24.466 --> 37:25.700
>> SORTED MARSHMALLOW.

37:25.766 --> 37:28.900
BUT OUR BEAR'S JOURNEY WASN'T

37:28.966 --> 37:32.800
COMPLETE.

37:32.866 --> 37:35.333
HE HAD ONE MORE THING LEFT TO

37:35.400 --> 37:43.200
SEE.

37:43.266 --> 37:51.800
SUDDENLY THERE IT WAS.

37:56.233 --> 38:02.000
THE MIGHTY TRIPOD ON THE RIVER.

38:02.066 --> 38:05.933
AS STRAIGHT AND STURDY AS

38:06.000 --> 38:11.133
MARSHMALLOW'S PENIS WAS NOT.

38:11.200 --> 38:11.900
WE ALL FACE A FOREBODING TUNDRA

38:11.966 --> 38:15.266
AT SOME POINT IN LIFE THAT WE

38:15.333 --> 38:16.666
MUST CROSS.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.100
BUT IT'S THE FIRE ON THE INSIDE

38:18.166 --> 38:19.066
THAT PUSHES US THROUGH THE

38:19.133 --> 38:21.700
BITTER COLD ON THE OUTSIDE AND

38:21.766 --> 38:23.833
AS LONG AS THAT FIRE BURNS

38:23.900 --> 38:30.400
WITHIN YOU, ANYTHING IS POSSIBL

38:30.466 --> 38:30.933
POSSIBLE.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.900
EXCEPT FOR FIXING A BROKEN PENI

38:33.966 --> 38:35.366
PENIS.

38:35.433 --> 38:36.866
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

38:36.933 --> 38:38.100
PLEASE WELCOME BACK FROM ALASKA,

38:51.200 --> 38:52.333
WELCOME BACK, MARSHMALLOW.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.600
HOW WAS ALASKA?

38:53.666 --> 38:54.633
OH, YOU CAN'T TALK BECAUSE YOUR

38:54.700 --> 38:55.400
PENIS HURTS TOO MUCH AND YOU'RE

38:55.466 --> 38:55.766
A BEAR?

38:55.833 --> 38:58.366

WE DON'T WIN, WE'RE GOING TO

39:09.733 --> 39:11.966
DONATE $10,000 TO THEM ANYWAY.
