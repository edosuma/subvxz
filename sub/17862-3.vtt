00:00.315 --> 00:02.501
A GP for Olivia,
or were you after a specialist?

00:02.814 --> 00:04.014
A psychiatrist, I think.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.744
I want to go home.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.805
Your father and your wife
signed you in.

00:07.806 --> 00:09.805
You cannot leave
without their consent.

00:09.806 --> 00:10.805
Orderlies!

00:10.806 --> 00:11.805
No! No!

00:11.806 --> 00:15.307
Your kind lacks moral fibre, James,
and I'm here to provide it for you.

00:15.308 --> 00:16.828
Is this why you tried
to kill yourself?

00:17.806 --> 00:19.805
It might be best if you had!

00:19.806 --> 00:21.973
I was upset.
You meant it.

00:21.974 --> 00:24.805
I'm not proud.
Nor should you be!

00:24.806 --> 00:25.806
I've just started
drawing up a guest list.

00:25.807 --> 00:28.805
For?
Our engagement party.

00:28.806 --> 00:30.805
I've come to talk about
our daughter.

00:30.806 --> 00:32.973
Who is she?
Anna.

00:32.974 --> 00:35.640
You're that interested in Anna?

00:35.641 --> 00:36.805
I'm being badgered to marry,

00:36.806 --> 00:39.805
and she's the only
vaguely interesting candidate.

00:39.806 --> 00:43.805
I already have investigators at
work, in Paris, London and Berlin.

00:43.806 --> 00:46.973
The talk of the camps.
You were a Jew in France at that time.

00:46.974 --> 00:49.705
I'd rather we concentrate
on the future.

00:49.706 --> 00:51.346
One thing that can be said
for the Nazis -

00:51.383 --> 00:53.206
they kept meticulous records.

02:25.721 --> 02:27.513
Welcome to Ash Park.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.720
Oh, it's like I've stepped
into fairyland!

02:30.721 --> 02:31.721
Hardly.

02:32.721 --> 02:34.721
Cinderella!

02:42.721 --> 02:45.256
Mr Bligh, I believe
congratulations are in order.

02:45.273 --> 02:46.708
Thank you. That's why I'm here.

02:46.788 --> 02:48.788
We're having
an engagement party tomorrow.

02:48.789 --> 02:51.787
We'd like James to join us.

02:51.788 --> 02:53.787
He's well into his aversion therapy.

02:53.788 --> 02:56.787
I thought it might be a chance
to reconnect.

02:56.788 --> 02:58.787
It's just for one day.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.788
I'm afraid that would be
counterproductive to his treatment.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.289
Oh.

03:02.290 --> 03:03.787
Sorry.

03:03.788 --> 03:06.787
May I see him?

03:06.788 --> 03:08.788
Given your part in his breakdown,
we'd prefer not.

03:08.789 --> 03:12.787
Dr Stewart and I believe
it's too soon, too raw.

03:12.788 --> 03:14.787
I see.

03:14.788 --> 03:19.788
I understand how hard this must be
for you, but it is for the best.

03:20.788 --> 03:23.787
This aversion therapy,
what does it involve?

03:23.788 --> 03:26.787
It's a new treatment, from America.

03:26.788 --> 03:29.290
Preliminary results
have been most encouraging.

03:32.788 --> 03:36.787
I'm sure you share your son's desire
to rid himself of his perversion.

03:36.788 --> 03:39.788
I ask for your trust.
I'm sure I have it.

03:45.788 --> 03:48.787
When are you finishing up
at the hospital?

03:48.788 --> 03:49.788
I'm staying on.

03:50.788 --> 03:53.787
Oh. Mr Bligh doesn't mind?

03:53.788 --> 03:55.622
Not at all.

03:55.623 --> 03:57.787
Well, I suppose times are changing.

03:57.788 --> 03:59.787
They are, which is why
we're having our party

03:59.788 --> 04:02.788
for the people important to us,
not the important people.

04:04.788 --> 04:07.787
It may not seem like a fairytale
to you, love,

04:07.788 --> 04:09.787
but it certainly does to me.

04:09.788 --> 04:11.788
I'm lucky. Very.

04:14.788 --> 04:19.786
There's that look again,
right under your smile.

04:19.788 --> 04:21.788
You never could hide much from me,
you know.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.787
You're here to enjoy yourself.
Oh, I am!

04:25.788 --> 04:27.788
But you...

04:29.788 --> 04:32.123
You are alright?
I'm fine.

04:37.788 --> 04:40.787
As the nausea builds, try to
stay focused on the images.

04:40.788 --> 04:42.788
Yes.

04:48.123 --> 04:49.789
Are you ready?

05:01.788 --> 05:03.623
Eyes open.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.788
Good.

05:25.788 --> 05:27.456
Shall we continue?

05:44.456 --> 05:46.787
At least you were allowed
to visit him.

05:46.788 --> 05:49.289
Briefly. And he was
heavily sedated.

05:49.290 --> 05:50.787
I don't think it's too much
to want to know

05:50.788 --> 05:52.787
what's being done to your son.

05:52.788 --> 05:54.787
George, he's in good hands.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.788
The main thing is, he's being strong,
and we owe him as much in return.

06:00.456 --> 06:03.787
So, tomorrow's gathering.

06:03.788 --> 06:04.787
You know you're more than welcome.

06:04.788 --> 06:08.787
In my own home?
Well, thank you very much.

06:08.788 --> 06:10.787
No, I think we both know what's best,

06:10.788 --> 06:12.787
given the style of celebration
that you've chosen.

06:12.788 --> 06:16.455
But I do hope
that you have an enjoyable afternoon.

06:16.456 --> 06:17.787
Thank you, Mother.

06:17.788 --> 06:20.787
That is wicked gossip!
It's true.

06:20.788 --> 06:23.622
He's been a great help
in raising her spirits.

06:23.623 --> 06:26.622
I think your attempt to visit James
is best not mentioned.

06:26.623 --> 06:28.955
Given our last meeting,
I've a lot to make up for.

06:28.956 --> 06:33.455
Andrew. It's lovely to see you.

06:33.456 --> 06:34.788
It is.

06:34.789 --> 06:37.455
I was telling George
how kind you've been.

06:37.456 --> 06:39.787
We've been enjoying
the company, sir.

06:39.788 --> 06:42.787
Shouldn't you be at Ash Park
preparing for tomorrow?

06:42.788 --> 06:45.788
I had urgent business.
I'm heading back there now.

06:46.788 --> 06:48.787
Perhaps you would like
to come with me.

06:48.788 --> 06:51.955
I have a car arranged
for the morning.

06:51.956 --> 06:55.787
Of course.
Why don't I do the honours?

06:55.788 --> 06:57.787
We can't expect you...
It'd be my pleasure.

06:57.788 --> 07:01.787
Gauche, inviting myself, I know,
but all for a good cause.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.787
There and back with a driver -
tres, tres dull.

07:04.788 --> 07:07.787
That's very kind of you.

07:07.788 --> 07:10.787
If you don't mind.
The more the merrier.

07:10.788 --> 07:12.787
Settled, then.
I'll see you away, George.

07:12.788 --> 07:14.788
There's no need, Mother.
No, no.

07:17.456 --> 07:19.122
The more the merrier,
for heaven's sake!

07:19.123 --> 07:20.787
Why not?

07:20.788 --> 07:22.787
I have spent the entire week

07:22.788 --> 07:24.787
placing barriers in the way
of his visiting Anna.

07:24.788 --> 07:27.788
No wonder he jumped in so quickly.
And you've undone it in a moment.

07:27.789 --> 07:31.787
Inverness may accept Anna
absorbing Italian at the Polettis'.

07:31.788 --> 07:34.787
Andrew is not as gullible.
I didn't think.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.788
No, you didn't!

07:42.788 --> 07:46.455
So, are you still enjoying it here?
Mm.

07:46.456 --> 07:49.787
I cooked my first meal
on my own last night.

07:49.788 --> 07:52.290
Ah! I didn't get a call
for food poisoning.

07:53.290 --> 07:56.787
I'd best...

07:56.788 --> 07:58.787
How's your Italian coming along?

07:58.788 --> 08:00.787
Molto bene, grazie.

08:00.788 --> 08:01.787
Quick learner.
No, not really.

08:01.788 --> 08:04.787
So, I should...
Yeah, of course.

08:04.788 --> 08:05.955
- Sorry.
- Dr Duncan.

08:05.956 --> 08:10.787
Gino. Just checking on your sister.
She's doing much better.

08:10.788 --> 08:11.788
Yes.

08:13.788 --> 08:17.787
Well, I've got to go.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.788
Good luck with the lingo.
Thanks.

08:23.788 --> 08:26.787
The last three days he comes,
he looks at Gilda...

08:26.788 --> 08:29.455
..then he talks to you.

08:29.456 --> 08:32.787
I can't help it if I'm fascinating.

08:32.788 --> 08:35.787
It's like he comes to see you.
Don't be silly!

08:35.788 --> 08:37.787
It's a little strange,
is all I'm saying.

08:37.788 --> 08:39.787
You're strange.

08:39.788 --> 08:41.787
You're jealous.
Of an old man?

08:41.788 --> 08:42.787
He's not that old.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.787
You're imagining things.
Maybe.

08:44.788 --> 08:46.788
But I know what I do imagine.

08:48.788 --> 08:49.788
Gino!

08:55.788 --> 08:58.788
We promised.
Yeah.

09:16.788 --> 09:20.455
I'll leave you both to catch up.
Don't hurry off on my account.

09:20.456 --> 09:22.788
I would stay on your account,
but I have an errand.

09:22.789 --> 09:24.787
We'll see you in the morning.
The big day!

09:24.788 --> 09:26.788
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

09:30.788 --> 09:32.787
She's lovely.

09:32.788 --> 09:34.788
Yes, I feel like
I've known her for years.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.956
So, is it...

09:42.623 --> 09:46.787
Is it Mrs Bligh who's caused this,
um, whatever it is?

09:46.788 --> 09:48.788
I told you. I'm fine.

09:49.788 --> 09:51.787
No, you're not.

09:51.788 --> 09:54.788
But no more prying.

09:57.788 --> 10:00.788
I hope you have the perfect day
for it.

10:06.788 --> 10:08.787
There are things
that have happened recently

10:08.788 --> 10:10.788
that have brought up the past.

10:12.788 --> 10:15.623
There's something
I've tried to ignore. It's...

10:19.788 --> 10:21.188
..something I've never told anyone.

10:25.788 --> 10:28.788
Tomorrow's party
makes our relationship official.

10:29.956 --> 10:33.788
If I'm going to tell George,
it has to be before.

10:34.788 --> 10:37.788
He'd never forgive me
if he learned about it after.

10:52.788 --> 10:55.788
Guess you haven't eaten. Leftovers.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.788
Look! A telephone.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.787
Don't know what to say.

11:05.788 --> 11:07.956
It is a lot to take in.

11:10.623 --> 11:12.622
So, what have you been doing?

11:12.623 --> 11:14.787
Finding excuses to see Anna.

11:14.788 --> 11:17.622
Finding others
to avoid seeing George.

11:17.623 --> 11:18.787
I said I mightn't make the party.

11:18.788 --> 11:21.787
You'd be conspicuous by your absence.

11:21.788 --> 11:24.290
How can I look him in the eye,
knowing what I do?

11:25.788 --> 11:28.623
I'll be there. We'll do it together.

11:32.788 --> 11:35.787
All those years
playing Aunt Carolyn.

11:35.788 --> 11:36.788
How did you manage?

11:38.788 --> 11:40.787
It broke my heart.

11:40.788 --> 11:42.788
For a long time.

11:43.788 --> 11:45.787
And then it didn't.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.787
Time heals.

11:48.788 --> 11:51.456
So I understand, I really do.

11:55.788 --> 11:58.787
My husband Rene and I were arrested.

11:58.788 --> 11:59.787
In Paris.

11:59.788 --> 12:03.787
For distributing anti-Nazi material.

12:03.788 --> 12:07.455
He convinced them
that he'd been acting alone.

12:07.456 --> 12:09.787
They let me go.

12:09.788 --> 12:11.788
I got as far as the Spanish border.

12:11.789 --> 12:15.787
I could have got out,
but I turned back, to fight.

12:15.788 --> 12:19.787
The Resistance.
I did what I could.

12:19.788 --> 12:22.623
Killed who I had to
to shorten the war.

12:23.788 --> 12:27.456
I was caught. I was sent to a camp.

12:28.788 --> 12:30.788
Ravensbruck.

12:32.788 --> 12:35.787
You have to understand
the depth of my love for Rene

12:35.788 --> 12:37.787
to understand what I did.

12:37.788 --> 12:40.788
All that mattered
was to remain alive.

12:41.788 --> 12:44.787
To see him again.

12:44.788 --> 12:48.456
There's no shame in surviving, love.

12:49.456 --> 12:51.788
It's how I survived.

13:02.456 --> 13:03.788
I used my body.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.788
They used it.

13:18.916 --> 13:20.917
My poor darling,
poor darling girl.

13:21.010 --> 13:23.344
The women who resisted were shot.

13:24.909 --> 13:27.409
The rest of us were taken
to a special barracks

13:27.501 --> 13:30.501
every day for over a year.

13:30.623 --> 13:33.958
Oh, it breaks my heart.

13:37.623 --> 13:39.622
Hark at me.

13:39.623 --> 13:42.124
Just making it worse.
I should be comforting you.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.958
I'm so sorry.
You have nothing to be sorry for.

13:46.623 --> 13:48.623
There is no shame
when there's no choice.

13:50.125 --> 13:52.623
How can I marry without telling him?

13:54.623 --> 13:56.623
What good would it do?

13:57.623 --> 14:02.623
You've suffered so much.
You deserve happiness now.

14:03.623 --> 14:05.291
You both do.

14:06.791 --> 14:12.623
I...I am sure
he's a lovely man.

14:15.623 --> 14:18.958
But, see, he's a man.

14:20.623 --> 14:22.623
Don't risk destroying this.

14:28.623 --> 14:30.622
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

14:30.623 --> 14:34.622
I need to ask your cooperation
in something.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.622
Andrew Swanson
is coming with Olivia tomorrow.

14:37.623 --> 14:38.622
So?

14:38.623 --> 14:41.622
I'd like you to be there
before the guests arrive

14:41.623 --> 14:43.623
and leave after they're gone.

14:44.623 --> 14:46.622
You mean, not arrive with Gino.

14:46.623 --> 14:48.623
Act like we mean nothing
to each other.

14:48.624 --> 14:51.622
During the party, yes.
You still think we won't work.

14:51.623 --> 14:54.622
I'm simply trying to protect you.
I don't need protecting!

14:54.623 --> 14:56.622
If this experiment doesn't work...
This is my future!

14:56.623 --> 14:58.457
Anna, please.
It is.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.622
That breeze you feel
is the winds of change, Father.

15:00.623 --> 15:02.622
Accept it.

15:02.623 --> 15:04.622
Which one of your books
did you get that from?

15:04.623 --> 15:08.457
I wrote it myself. I am capable
of independent thought.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.623
I had noticed.

15:11.623 --> 15:12.623
Is it too much to ask?

15:12.624 --> 15:14.957
Yes.
Anna.

15:14.958 --> 15:17.623
Tomorrow is your papa's special day.

15:19.623 --> 15:20.790
We'll do what makes him happy.

15:20.791 --> 15:23.623
It's not what's right.
It is what is right.

15:25.623 --> 15:28.623
Just like he will do
on the day of our engagement party.

15:29.623 --> 15:31.622
When we do have it.

15:31.623 --> 15:33.623
Fair deal.

15:36.623 --> 15:38.623
Anna?
Alright.

15:40.623 --> 15:42.623
Thank you both.

15:43.791 --> 15:44.958
Goodnight.

15:50.623 --> 15:54.622
You're not worried? About Andrew?
Should I be?

15:54.623 --> 15:56.623
No.
Then I'm not worried.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.623
Sarah.

16:07.623 --> 16:09.623
Are you awake?

16:34.958 --> 16:36.623
Good morning!

16:37.623 --> 16:40.623
What time is it?
9:30.

16:41.623 --> 16:44.623
It's too early.
We're up at six on the farm.

16:44.624 --> 16:46.622
Uncivilised.

16:46.623 --> 16:49.623
There's a dress I want to wear.

16:52.125 --> 16:55.622
Your father and I had a chat
when he got home.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.957
Good girl for doing what he asked.

16:57.958 --> 16:59.622
I suppose.

16:59.623 --> 17:02.622
But since I'm forced
into being here...

17:02.623 --> 17:04.622
What are you up to?

17:04.623 --> 17:07.622
I'm using luncheon to make a point.

17:07.623 --> 17:09.622
Ah!

17:09.623 --> 17:11.622
Shouldn't we wait for Anna?
She'll be along.

17:11.623 --> 17:13.622
Something about a surprise.

17:13.623 --> 17:15.622
A pleasant one, I hope.

17:15.623 --> 17:18.622
Guest of honour first.
Oh, you're spoiling me.

17:18.623 --> 17:20.622
We're thrilled you're here.

17:20.623 --> 17:24.290
If I may, I would like
to propose a toast

17:24.290 --> 17:26.622
to the future happiness of you both.

17:26.623 --> 17:29.082
To happiness.
Happiness.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.623
Long happiness.

17:34.623 --> 17:37.622
Luncheon is served!

17:37.623 --> 17:39.622
Spaghetti Napoletana

17:39.623 --> 17:41.622
alla Poletti.

17:41.623 --> 17:43.622
Oh, please, miss,
it's my job to carry.

17:43.623 --> 17:46.290
Yes, and it's Cook's job to cook,
but she didn't.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.622
Did she, Amy?

17:47.623 --> 17:50.622
You should have seen her, sir.
She wouldn't let us lift a finger.

17:50.623 --> 17:53.457
You did that?
Just like Mamma makes.

17:53.458 --> 17:55.623
To the winds of change.

17:57.623 --> 17:58.623
Aunty Peg.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.958
Oh, it's so beautiful!

18:16.791 --> 18:19.622
Remember our last reception here,
for the Japanese?

18:19.623 --> 18:23.623
I said how wonderful it would be
if you were by my side.

18:24.623 --> 18:26.622
And now look.

18:26.623 --> 18:28.623
I want a perfect day
for my perfect bride-to-be.

18:31.623 --> 18:35.083
Yes, a perfect day for everyone.

18:37.623 --> 18:39.957
Sir, your first guests.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.791
Oh.
Ready?

18:43.623 --> 18:44.623
Ready.

18:49.623 --> 18:51.622
Are you sure it's wise
not to be there?

18:51.623 --> 18:53.623
And appear to endorse
the whole fiasco?

18:55.623 --> 18:58.623
Thank you, Diane. I'll serve.

19:01.623 --> 19:05.622
Now, Prudence, there's a matter
in which I'd appreciate your assistance.

19:05.623 --> 19:08.458
I expected this tete-a-tete
days ago.

19:09.623 --> 19:11.622
May I hazard a guess?

19:11.623 --> 19:15.622
You want my support
in bringing down the Jewess?

19:15.623 --> 19:18.622
And she's a nurse, you say.

19:18.623 --> 19:22.082
Oh, there's a lot more to her
than that.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.622
I'm having inquiries made
into her background.

19:24.623 --> 19:26.622
Eminently sensible.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.622
The woman has
many admirable qualities,

19:29.623 --> 19:33.622
and oddly I find myself somewhat
rejuvenated by her presence,

19:33.623 --> 19:36.622
but I... I cannot sit by
and watch her be anointed

19:36.623 --> 19:38.622
as the future mistress of Ash Park.

19:38.623 --> 19:41.290
The union is doomed.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.082
Poor George
has suffered quite enough.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.623
What do you propose?

19:46.083 --> 19:49.622
Mixing with the Inverness locals
is one thing.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.791
Socialising with our kind
is quite another.

20:04.623 --> 20:07.622
# Give me a kiss
to build a dream on

20:07.623 --> 20:13.622
# And my imagination
will thrive upon that kiss

20:13.623 --> 20:16.622
# Sweetheart,
I ask no more than this

20:16.623 --> 20:18.622
â™ª A kiss to build a dream on... â™ª

20:18.623 --> 20:20.622
Jack, you made it.

20:20.623 --> 20:23.622
Couldn't miss this one, eh?
You wouldn't have been forgiven.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.623
You're a lucky man.

20:26.623 --> 20:28.622
No arguments there.

20:28.623 --> 20:30.623
You're on my side, aren't you?

20:31.623 --> 20:34.622
I've been forcing Father
to see that I've changed.

20:34.623 --> 20:36.622
Leave innocent bystanders
out of this, Anna.

20:36.623 --> 20:38.622
Dr Duncan understands me
far better than you do.

20:38.623 --> 20:40.622
You've seen it firsthand, haven't
you?

20:40.623 --> 20:41.622
I...

20:41.623 --> 20:44.622
He shows interest and asks questions
about how my Italian's going.

20:44.623 --> 20:46.622
Alright, Anna.

20:46.623 --> 20:49.063
I'm sure Sarah's more qualified
to give an opinion. Excuse me.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.622
Ciao.

20:50.623 --> 20:52.290
Everything going well?

20:52.291 --> 20:54.290
Apart from you
staring at me all the time.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.622
I've been mingling too.
Mingle more.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.622
They're all slightly intimidated.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.622
Except for Doris.

20:59.623 --> 21:02.623
Yes, I had noticed.

21:03.623 --> 21:06.623
I think that's an SOS. Excuse me.

21:07.623 --> 21:10.622
From the moment Miss Adams
walked up my front path,

21:10.623 --> 21:13.290
I said to myself,
"This one's special."

21:13.291 --> 21:16.622
And now she's marrying a Bligh.

21:16.623 --> 21:20.457
It's like something
out of 'Portia Faces Life'.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.622
Her serial.

21:21.623 --> 21:25.623
I sometimes feel as if
I shot Cupid's arrow myself.

21:26.623 --> 21:30.622
Oh, Miss Adams!
Oh, it's a lovely party.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.622
Just lovely.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

21:32.623 --> 21:35.623
Such a pity that Mrs Bligh
couldn't attend.

21:35.624 --> 21:38.957
Yes. I was wondering
if I might steal you away.

21:38.958 --> 21:41.622
Need some help with the speeches.
Oh, if I could assist...

21:41.623 --> 21:44.623
I'll see you later then, Mr Briggs.

21:44.624 --> 21:46.623
On the dance floor.

21:48.623 --> 21:52.622
Thank you, missy. A man can work up
a thirst talking to that woman.

21:52.623 --> 21:55.790
You're on her dance card.
I ain't promised nothing.

21:55.791 --> 21:57.622
I owe you.

21:57.623 --> 22:00.622
I owe you in more ways
than I can count.

22:00.623 --> 22:03.622
After what we've been through of
late, today's a real tonic.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.623
It is.

22:06.623 --> 22:07.623
Good luck.
Cheers.

22:09.623 --> 22:13.622
If George is to see her
as a fish out of water,

22:13.623 --> 22:15.622
we must construct a suitable pond.

22:15.623 --> 22:17.622
Mm.

22:17.623 --> 22:19.943
I think these names will constitute
a formidable gathering.

22:20.623 --> 22:22.622
Oh, indeed.

22:22.623 --> 22:25.622
At the very least,
George will witness her discomfort.

22:25.623 --> 22:30.622
At best, she may be provoked
to some form of outburst.

22:30.623 --> 22:32.623
The Jews can be so sensitive.

22:32.624 --> 22:37.622
Now, what's the pretext?
What is the occasion?

22:37.623 --> 22:39.458
It has to be something
he can't decline.

22:42.623 --> 22:43.622
Ah.
Yes?

22:43.623 --> 22:45.622
Who arrives next month,

22:45.623 --> 22:48.791
bringing a hive of social activity
not to be missed?

22:53.623 --> 22:56.623
God save our Queen.
Indeed.

23:01.624 --> 23:04.622
Miriam, Isaac,
I'm so glad you're here.

23:04.623 --> 23:06.622
For you, even on Shabbat.

23:06.623 --> 23:11.290
And you, out amongst people again.
She hardly slept last night.

23:11.291 --> 23:12.623
So excited.
Aunty!

23:12.624 --> 23:16.622
Neither did I.
So, where's the lucky man?

23:16.623 --> 23:18.623
There he is.

23:20.623 --> 23:22.622
Gentlemen really do prefer blondes.

23:22.623 --> 23:25.124
You and your Marilyn Monroe!

23:25.125 --> 23:27.957
A drink first, and then
you can meet my aunty.

23:27.958 --> 23:32.622
Roy Briggs, Doris Collins
and now the Jewish community.

23:32.623 --> 23:34.623
Mother would expire.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.623
Ah! Right on cue.

23:38.623 --> 23:42.622
Amo! Carla! Gilda. Gino.

23:42.623 --> 23:44.290
Miss Anna.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.622
What a silly charade.

23:45.623 --> 23:48.458
Si. Ah, remember, just friends, hm?

23:50.623 --> 23:53.290
Hello, handsome.

23:53.291 --> 23:57.458
If you want to be a Poletti,
act like a Poletti.

24:01.623 --> 24:02.790
It was a joke.

24:02.791 --> 24:05.622
They're just worried we're gonna
start kissing in front of everyone.

24:05.623 --> 24:07.622
Let's.
Anna!

24:07.623 --> 24:09.623
He's staring again.

24:14.623 --> 24:18.622
It feels odd being back.
It's a gothic old pile.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.622
James and I were both keen
to leave.

24:21.623 --> 24:24.622
I imagine living with Mrs Bligh
has its challenges.

24:24.623 --> 24:26.623
Somewhat of an understatement.

24:27.623 --> 24:31.290
This happy event, however,
gives me hope.

24:31.291 --> 24:33.623
Let's hope Anna gives me some too.

24:36.623 --> 24:38.623
I'm planning to propose.

24:38.624 --> 24:40.622
Today?

24:40.623 --> 24:42.790
We've been circling each other
for months,

24:42.791 --> 24:44.957
and I have the feeling
someone else is circling,

24:44.958 --> 24:46.790
so I best not leave my run too late.

24:46.791 --> 24:48.622
Did Anna mention someone else?

24:48.623 --> 24:50.622
She's been making excuses
to go to the city.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.623
I think a man was involved.

24:53.791 --> 24:56.622
Shall we?

24:56.623 --> 24:57.623
Good luck.

25:08.672 --> 25:10.004
How are you managing with George?

25:11.426 --> 25:13.757
Luckily he's distracted.

25:13.758 --> 25:15.758
He's like a teenager.

25:16.466 --> 25:17.465
Takes you back.

25:17.466 --> 25:20.301
It does.

25:22.466 --> 25:25.465
How have you avoided
being dragged to the altar so far?

25:25.466 --> 25:26.801
Who says I have?

25:27.801 --> 25:30.465
I've got four wives,
three at the hospital, one at home.

25:30.466 --> 25:34.301
It's a serious question.
It can't be for lack of opportunity.

25:35.466 --> 25:38.465
The right one or not at all
is my motto.

25:38.466 --> 25:40.466
And the right one hasn't come along?

25:41.466 --> 25:42.466
Twice.

25:47.466 --> 25:49.465
Oh, I see.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.465
The better man won.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.465
And the other?

25:54.466 --> 25:56.467
There was no winner there.

26:01.466 --> 26:03.465
Mystery solved.
Hm?

26:03.466 --> 26:06.800
What better way to get on
her good side than to get on mine?

26:06.801 --> 26:09.465
He knows we're close. That's why
he's been hanging around me.

26:09.466 --> 26:11.466
Romance if ever I saw it.

26:13.467 --> 26:15.465
He hardly knows her.

26:15.466 --> 26:17.465
Who wouldn't fall in love with her?

26:17.466 --> 26:19.465
Oh, no. Quickly,
say something in Italian.

26:19.466 --> 26:20.465
Amo!

26:20.466 --> 26:23.465
Si, si, certo!

26:23.466 --> 26:24.465
Mrs Collins.
Si! Si!

26:24.466 --> 26:28.465
Oh, Mr Poletti.
Mrs Collins, ciao.

26:28.466 --> 26:30.465
Oh, hello!

26:30.466 --> 26:32.633
I haven't seen you
for a long, long time.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.134
Close. What did you say?

26:36.134 --> 26:38.466
"You look as pretty as a picture."
Really?

26:38.467 --> 26:41.466
Really, no. I...
I said she talks too much.

26:52.466 --> 26:55.465
Anna, do what you must.

26:55.466 --> 26:57.301
It's OK.

27:01.466 --> 27:04.466
Hello! How have you been?

27:10.467 --> 27:12.465
There you are!

27:12.466 --> 27:13.801
Oh.

27:15.466 --> 27:17.466
Such a beautiful day.

27:19.134 --> 27:20.465
I'm a silly old woman.

27:20.466 --> 27:23.134
Don't you talk about
my aunt like that.

27:24.466 --> 27:28.466
It just breaks my heart
what you suffered.

27:31.466 --> 27:33.466
You made the right decision.

27:35.466 --> 27:37.466
He doesn't need to know.
No.

27:44.466 --> 27:46.465
Ma'am. A telegram.

27:46.466 --> 27:47.801
Oh, thank you.

27:52.466 --> 27:58.465
Arrived. Inquiries already
promising. Will elaborate by post.

27:58.466 --> 28:00.466
Regina.

28:07.134 --> 28:11.466
Aren't we being a little unsociable?
Coming from you!

28:12.466 --> 28:16.967
The first time we met, you arrived
half an hour late, in jodhpurs.

28:16.968 --> 28:18.465
I was trying to make
a bad impression.

28:18.466 --> 28:20.465
You failed.
I'll have to try harder.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.465
I've rather missed you.

28:22.466 --> 28:25.465
I'm sure you've had plenty
to keep you amused.

28:25.466 --> 28:27.465
Not as much as you think.

28:27.466 --> 28:31.465
And it does all start to
wear a bit thin after a while.

28:31.466 --> 28:33.465
I'm thinking of entering politics.

28:33.466 --> 28:37.465
Good choice for you.
Which means it's time I married.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.466
Anyone in mind?

28:41.467 --> 28:43.466
Why do you think I came today?

28:46.466 --> 28:48.465
I don't expect an immediate answer.

28:48.466 --> 28:50.465
All I'm asking
is that you consider it.

28:50.466 --> 28:53.466
There's no point.
The answer will be no.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.466
You gave that some serious thought.
I'm sorry, Andrew, but it will be.

28:59.466 --> 29:01.465
You're not still seeing your chap
in the city, are you?

29:01.466 --> 29:04.800
The mystery one
I was your alibi for.

29:04.801 --> 29:07.465
Since you hadn't been up lately
I'd rather assumed that it ended.

29:07.466 --> 29:10.465
It has.
Is there someone else then?

29:10.466 --> 29:12.465
Someone closer to home?

29:12.466 --> 29:14.465
I'm not about to share
my private life with you.

29:14.466 --> 29:16.466
There is!

29:17.466 --> 29:19.465
You can't tell me
that a girl like you

29:19.466 --> 29:21.967
wants to spend the rest of her life
here amongst them.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.465
What's wrong with them?

29:23.466 --> 29:26.466
You don't honestly think
you'll do better than me here?

29:29.466 --> 29:30.466
Excuse me.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.465
I'm glad you told me
about this, James.

30:04.466 --> 30:07.465
It proves what you have been
unwilling to accept.

30:07.466 --> 30:10.465
You lust for the male form in general

30:10.466 --> 30:12.466
rather than desire
one or two individuals.

30:14.466 --> 30:16.968
Perhaps now you'll accept
the severity of your case.

30:19.466 --> 30:21.466
There are other treatments,

30:21.467 --> 30:25.466
more extreme but more effective,
which we may need to consider.

30:27.466 --> 30:30.465
Whatever it takes. Hm?

30:30.466 --> 30:33.134
Your own words, yes?

30:37.301 --> 30:39.465
I tried to see him.

30:39.466 --> 30:41.301
I wanted him here today.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.465
They wouldn't allow it.

30:44.466 --> 30:47.465
As long as he knows
he was welcome.

30:47.466 --> 30:49.466
I asked them to tell him that.

30:51.467 --> 30:53.466
I'm not proud of that day.

30:55.466 --> 30:57.466
I can see that.

30:59.801 --> 31:03.800
Andrew Swanson.
He is a good friend.

31:03.801 --> 31:05.967
But obviously he shouldn't know
the full story.

31:05.968 --> 31:07.467
No. Nor about Anna.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.466
Anna?

31:11.466 --> 31:13.465
Anna and Gino.

31:13.466 --> 31:15.466
Mother didn't tell you?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.466
I only just found out.

31:28.968 --> 31:31.465
I'm so sorry.

31:31.466 --> 31:32.467
Who is he?

31:34.466 --> 31:36.300
No-one you know.

31:36.301 --> 31:39.967
I would never have encouraged you
if I'd even suspected.

31:39.968 --> 31:41.466
Her loss.

31:42.466 --> 31:44.466
I don't see the point in staying.

31:45.466 --> 31:48.465
You?
I must.

31:48.466 --> 31:51.465
What are we hiding up here for?

31:51.466 --> 31:54.465
Everyone for the hokey-pokey.

31:54.466 --> 31:55.465
Come along, Mrs Bligh.

31:55.466 --> 31:57.465
And no shirking.

31:57.466 --> 32:00.466
Now, there's an offer
you can't refuse.

32:07.301 --> 32:11.465
# You put your right arm
in, you put your right arm out

32:11.466 --> 32:15.465
# You put your right arm in
and you shake it all about

32:15.466 --> 32:18.465
# You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around

32:18.466 --> 32:21.467
# That's what it's all about

32:22.467 --> 32:26.465
# Do the hokey-pokey

32:26.466 --> 32:29.465
# Do the hokey-pokey

32:29.466 --> 32:34.465
# Do the hokey-pokey

32:34.466 --> 32:37.465
# That's what it's all about

32:37.466 --> 32:41.465
# You put your left arm in,
you put your left arm out

32:41.466 --> 32:45.465
# You put your left arm in
and you shake it all about

32:45.466 --> 32:48.633
# You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around

32:48.634 --> 32:51.466
â™ª That's what it's all about. â™ª

33:15.879 --> 33:17.547
Livvy!

33:23.550 --> 33:25.550
Why didn't you tell me?

33:26.550 --> 33:28.549
About you and Gino?

33:28.550 --> 33:31.549
It all came out
while you were in the city.

33:31.550 --> 33:35.549
You said you were just friends.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.550
I'm so sorry.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.549
I owe you an apology too.

33:47.550 --> 33:51.549
I knew what Andrew was planning.

33:51.550 --> 33:53.852
I encouraged it.

33:53.893 --> 33:55.391
Oh.

33:57.391 --> 34:00.350
Are you sure
you've made the right choice?

34:00.351 --> 34:02.350
Not you too.

34:02.351 --> 34:05.390
I don't want your life
to be difficult

34:05.391 --> 34:08.058
when it doesn't have to be.

34:08.059 --> 34:11.389
Because how on earth could I be happy
with a farmer's son

34:11.391 --> 34:13.391
instead of with someone rich?

34:14.391 --> 34:17.389
Gino is lovely.

34:17.391 --> 34:20.389
But Andrew is from your own class,

34:20.391 --> 34:23.389
and things like that, they...
they do matter.

34:23.391 --> 34:28.391
I don't care about all of that.
What Gino and I have, it's special.

34:29.391 --> 34:32.391
Have you... been intimate?

34:36.391 --> 34:38.558
And it was wonderful.

34:38.559 --> 34:41.389
Anna...
You must understand that feeling.

34:41.391 --> 34:46.389
What it's like to...
to give yourself to someone.

34:46.391 --> 34:48.350
To lose yourself.

34:48.351 --> 34:52.389
To feel the touch of his skin
and his kisses.

34:52.391 --> 34:56.389
To know that he is giving himself
completely to you.

34:56.391 --> 34:57.391
Stop!

35:00.893 --> 35:05.391
Livvy, I love him.
I really thought you'd understand.

35:06.391 --> 35:09.390
I'm-I'm sorry, I...
If it's what you truly want...

35:09.391 --> 35:11.390
It is.

35:11.391 --> 35:13.351
Then I can only wish you well.

35:14.391 --> 35:16.059
I need to freshen up.

35:42.391 --> 35:45.391
Righto, she's speech time!

35:46.391 --> 35:49.390
Gather round, folks!

35:49.391 --> 35:50.390
I'm gonna head off.

35:50.391 --> 35:53.391
I'll kick her off
with a little bush ballad.

35:54.559 --> 35:59.390
There was a wild colonial girl,
Miss Adams was her name.

35:59.391 --> 36:04.350
From humble home she did set sail
and never was the same.

36:04.351 --> 36:09.390
She was away for many a year,
a quest that took its toll.

36:09.391 --> 36:15.390
But 'twas aboard the homeward ship
her true fate did unscroll.

36:15.391 --> 36:20.390
For on that ship she met her match,
a gentleman to boot.

36:20.391 --> 36:24.390
One look at her and he was smit,
like a wild-eyed bandicoot.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.390
Whoa!

36:26.391 --> 36:32.892
And now she'll be his blushing
bride, and he her gallant buck,

36:32.893 --> 36:36.390
and so we wish the happy pair...

36:36.391 --> 36:37.725
A right royal...

36:37.726 --> 36:39.390
..the very best of luck!

36:39.391 --> 36:42.391
Hear, hear!

36:50.391 --> 36:52.391
I think they're waiting for this.

37:06.351 --> 37:08.390
We were at the back of the crowd.
No-one saw us.

37:08.391 --> 37:10.390
I know.
And don't be mad at Gino.

37:10.391 --> 37:12.390
I put my head on his shoulder,
so blame me!

37:12.391 --> 37:14.390
It's got nothing to do with that.
Anna, let him speak!

37:14.391 --> 37:15.893
Thank you, Gino.

37:19.059 --> 37:23.390
I brought you in here to tell you
that you were right.

37:23.391 --> 37:27.391
I agreed to the trial hoping
it would fail, and I'm not proud of it.

37:28.391 --> 37:32.390
Today I stood in front of everyone
celebrating my love,

37:32.391 --> 37:35.390
and yet I'm forcing you
to hide yours.

37:35.391 --> 37:37.391
And I do apologise.

37:39.391 --> 37:44.390
You've made me believe in you
and the choice you've made.

37:44.391 --> 37:46.390
You have my blessing.

37:46.391 --> 37:48.350
Really?

37:48.351 --> 37:50.390
Mm. And you don't need three months.

37:50.391 --> 37:52.391
You're engaged.

37:54.351 --> 37:55.725
Congratulations, Gino.

37:55.726 --> 37:57.391
Thank you, Mr Bligh.

38:10.391 --> 38:11.391
Ah.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.725
To the happy couple.

38:14.726 --> 38:18.390
Anna and the eyetie grape grower.

38:18.391 --> 38:20.892
You kept that close.

38:20.893 --> 38:24.058
Well, I had hoped that she would see
the error of her ways

38:24.059 --> 38:25.390
and come to her senses.

38:25.391 --> 38:29.893
I was on the verge of proposing.
Oh, Andrew, I'm sorry.

38:31.726 --> 38:35.390
If you could resist the urge
to disseminate this.

38:35.391 --> 38:38.390
You may have no further interest...
What makes you think that?

38:38.391 --> 38:42.391
Well, I assumed that...
Incorrectly.

38:44.391 --> 38:48.351
Do you think I'm going to let
some wop farm boy have her?

38:54.217 --> 38:56.216
First to arrive, last to leave.

38:56.217 --> 38:59.216
Do you have your keys?
I'm not doing the driving.

38:59.217 --> 39:01.216
Here she is!

39:01.217 --> 39:05.216
Have you got your new hat?
Yes, Mr Briggs.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.551
Now, in the truck with you.

39:07.552 --> 39:09.216
Can you drive, Doris?

39:09.217 --> 39:12.217
Ex-Land Army. '42 to '44.
We all did our bit.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.217
Arrivederci.

39:20.217 --> 39:21.884
Quite a day.

39:21.885 --> 39:23.217
Quite a day.

39:25.217 --> 39:27.217
Oh!

39:30.217 --> 39:34.216
You gave me this to keep until
you had your father's blessing.

39:34.217 --> 39:36.217
Now it is yours.

39:37.552 --> 39:39.217
Gino.

39:48.217 --> 39:51.216
Welcome to the family, Anna.

39:51.217 --> 39:54.216
Alla vostra salute.
Mrs Gino Poletti!

39:54.217 --> 39:56.009
Soon!

39:56.010 --> 39:58.217
Salute!

40:16.885 --> 40:18.216
Oh.

40:18.217 --> 40:22.216
Oh. Is it late?
Everyone's gone.

40:22.217 --> 40:25.551
Oh, I must have had
one glass too many.

40:25.552 --> 40:27.217
You weren't the only one.

40:29.217 --> 40:32.217
Oh, you got your perfect day.

40:34.218 --> 40:38.177
You know, some people
never find a great love.

40:39.217 --> 40:41.217
But you did.

40:42.217 --> 40:43.217
Twice.

40:49.177 --> 40:50.217
Yes.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.217
Not hungry?

40:57.217 --> 40:59.216
It isn't the baby, is it?

40:59.217 --> 41:00.217
No.

41:03.385 --> 41:06.217
I noticed your spirits shift
over the afternoon.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.217
Can I help?

41:11.217 --> 41:12.217
No.

41:13.217 --> 41:15.384
How did it go with Dr Stewart?

41:15.385 --> 41:18.551
James asked me for his number.
Did you see him?

41:18.552 --> 41:22.177
I'm told he's the best for women
with nervous disorders.

41:25.217 --> 41:28.216
The referral wasn't for me.

41:28.217 --> 41:30.217
Who?

41:33.217 --> 41:35.010
James?

41:36.217 --> 41:39.217
I'm very proud of you.

41:40.217 --> 41:42.217
Anna loves him.
Mm.

41:44.217 --> 41:45.719
I love you.

41:46.719 --> 41:49.216
I'm not perfect.

41:49.217 --> 41:52.216
Pardon?
I need you to know I'm not perfect.

41:52.217 --> 41:55.216
You are to me.

41:55.217 --> 41:57.217
Is that so terrible?

41:59.217 --> 42:00.217
No.

42:10.217 --> 42:13.885
George, I'm sorry, I think
I've made a terrible mistake.

42:14.885 --> 42:18.017
The procedure is called
a transorbital lobotomy

42:18.080 --> 42:21.080
and has proven 100% effective
in cases such as yours.

42:22.748 --> 42:26.079
We insert an instrument
up behind the eye

42:26.080 --> 42:28.079
through the thin layer of bone
into the frontal lobe.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.079
There's no pain.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.079
By making adjustments to the lobe

42:32.080 --> 42:37.080
we can ensure a change of behaviour,
and I stress 'ensure'.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.081
A word to take comfort in.
