03:16.562 --> 03:18.263
Hey.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.198
Simpson.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.100
I didn't think you'd come.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.969
We chewed the same sand.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.638
Yeah, I'm still pickin'
it outta my teeth.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.950
Shit, man.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.988
Long time.

03:34.246 --> 03:36.181
How ya doin', Smitty?

03:37.450 --> 03:40.418
I haven't heard that nickname
since Mission Sentinel.

03:40.419 --> 03:41.786
I'm doin' good.

03:41.787 --> 03:44.489
The German doctors
down in Landstuhl,

03:44.490 --> 03:46.324
they stitched me back
together pretty well.

03:46.325 --> 03:48.259
When'd you get outta that sandbox?

03:48.260 --> 03:49.728
Couple of months back.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.040
Doin' okay?

03:52.832 --> 03:55.300
They say I am.

03:55.301 --> 04:00.172
Hey, they broke me,
they gotta fix me.

04:01.507 --> 04:04.318
Welcome to the world.

04:14.987 --> 04:18.255
Listen, Smitty, I know this is not a good
time to be lookin' for a job. But if...

04:18.257 --> 04:20.829
I said I'm okay.

04:21.861 --> 04:26.164
I got a line on a job
over at Sembach Annex,

04:26.165 --> 04:28.609
training Army Snipers.

04:29.468 --> 04:34.077
You know what they say,
"Those who can't, teach."

04:34.607 --> 04:36.807
Well, the Army owes you that.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.281
It's my daughter Alex at school.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.683
I didn't know you had a kid.

04:44.684 --> 04:47.552
I got two, Alex and Lucy.

04:47.553 --> 04:51.457
Don't see much of 'em. Not anymore.

04:51.857 --> 04:53.963
Sorry.

04:54.226 --> 04:56.298
Yeah.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.701
You guys threw me under
the bus on Sentinel.

05:02.702 --> 05:06.776
We got sent on a bad
mission and people died.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.074
They hung that
friendly-fire shit on me.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.176
Your gun did it.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.078
I was ordered to fire.

05:13.079 --> 05:17.182
And I was ordered by the
Colonel to give those orders.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.653
Call it awash.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.397
What are we doin' here, Smitty?

05:32.398 --> 05:35.801
You got somethin' to say, say it.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.439
Do you think that
God will forgive us

05:41.440 --> 05:43.819
for all the shit that we've done?

05:45.444 --> 05:49.416
We did things right,
most of the time.

05:49.548 --> 05:52.291
We were drinkin' from
the devil's cup.

05:53.085 --> 05:55.658
That's just war.

05:56.021 --> 05:57.388
So that's it?

05:57.389 --> 05:59.257
That's it.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.092
Just like that.

06:01.093 --> 06:06.464
So fuck you and fuck the
Colonel, I did my job.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.370
And I did mine.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.312
Hey, did I tell ya?

07:27.313 --> 07:29.314
Getting my citizenship next month.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.024
- Finally came through, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:32.451 --> 07:33.918
It pays to be a Marine.

07:33.919 --> 07:36.788
God, I can't wait to
have that blue passport.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.489
Well deserved.

07:38.490 --> 07:41.292
So, Corporal, you got an
interesting nickname.

07:41.293 --> 07:44.605
- Mango?
- Yeah, where'd it come from?

07:44.763 --> 07:47.932
My first live op, we
were in East Timor.

07:47.933 --> 07:51.636
Thirty days in the jungle,
short on food supply.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.472
Sol made my team a
mango-snake salad.

07:54.473 --> 07:56.875
What'd you season it with?

07:56.876 --> 07:58.776
Sea salt.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.211
Hmm.

08:00.212 --> 08:02.420
Sounds good right about now.

08:04.216 --> 08:07.357
- Movement, one o'clock.
- Range me.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.823
Thirteen hundred.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.560
On target.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.031
- Hold scope.
- Wind?

08:18.964 --> 08:21.399
It's comin' off the mountain
at our one o'clock,

08:21.400 --> 08:24.469
quarter value, push two
clicks to the right.

08:26.338 --> 08:27.639
Angle?

08:27.640 --> 08:31.248
Descending 18 degrees,
no adjustment.

08:32.578 --> 08:36.714
More Syrians coming into Turkey.
Who can blame 'em?

08:39.717 --> 08:41.961
Your move, Reese.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.399
White rook captures F five.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.093
Fuck.

08:49.094 --> 08:52.406
That's it, son. Check and mate.

08:52.765 --> 08:56.200
<i>NS-Two, NS-Two,
this is NS-One, over.</i>

08:56.201 --> 08:58.836
NS-One, this is NS-Two,
what's your traffic, over?

08:58.837 --> 09:01.572
NS-Two, please advise
on your sit rep, over.

09:01.573 --> 09:03.174
Livin' the dream, baby.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.009
How's your focus?

09:05.010 --> 09:10.325
Currently, I am focused
on cleaning my barrel.

09:10.549 --> 09:12.417
I can see your silhouette.

09:12.418 --> 09:15.264
<i>Get back in your hide.</i>

09:18.724 --> 09:20.258
Can I shake first?

09:20.259 --> 09:21.693
Oh, you got jokes?

09:21.694 --> 09:23.061
<i>Always.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:26.364
Keeps me light, on the edge,
where I need to be.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.132
You need to be on your scope.

09:28.133 --> 09:31.235
<i>I know you're a member of the Green
Jackets Team back in the UK,</i>

09:31.236 --> 09:33.638
but sniping isn't just
about shooting straight,

09:33.639 --> 09:35.473
you also have to shoot first,

09:35.474 --> 09:37.041
<i>so get back on your rifle.</i>

09:37.042 --> 09:40.712
<i>Tell knucklehead riding shotgun
to put the chess set away.</i>

09:40.713 --> 09:42.380
Aye-aye.

09:48.587 --> 09:52.058
Got something. Could
be our guy. 12 o'clock.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.625
This party's startin'.

09:54.626 --> 09:57.128
NS-Two, put your dick
away and lock it up.

09:57.129 --> 09:59.838
Time to go to work.

10:12.144 --> 10:15.279
Vehicle, belt-fed AK.
They're coming heavy.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.659
Call it out.

10:25.657 --> 10:28.826
Target on ground.
Head-wrap, sackcloth.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.294
He's a real charmer.

10:30.295 --> 10:32.333
Hey!

10:33.098 --> 10:35.443
Do the math.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.302
970 meters.

10:38.303 --> 10:40.805
Wind, one-half value.

10:40.806 --> 10:45.745
Angle, 13 degrees descending.
No adjustment.

10:47.946 --> 10:49.514
On target.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.519
Fire when ready.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.220
Refugees are blocking my shot.

10:56.221 --> 10:59.123
NS-Two, do you have a clean
shot to the Tango, over?

10:59.124 --> 11:00.491
Give me a sec.

11:00.492 --> 11:02.326
Go two up.

11:02.327 --> 11:04.562
This is a senior Taliban.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.331
If you have a clean shot,
send the mail now.

11:07.332 --> 11:09.575
Roger that, over.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.503
Put some lead on this guy, Reese.

11:12.504 --> 11:14.906
<i>Do it now!</i>

11:16.208 --> 11:18.416
Hey! Hey!

11:21.180 --> 11:23.081
- Miss.
- Ready for a gunfight?

11:23.082 --> 11:26.155
- Thought you'd never ask.
- Go to guns.

11:50.342 --> 11:51.909
Hit.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.244
Give me a shot.

12:08.627 --> 12:12.633
NS-Two, you have two hostile
technicals approaching your position.

12:16.468 --> 12:19.109
Fuck me! We're takin' heavy fire!

12:24.476 --> 12:26.616
Man down! Man down!

12:27.379 --> 12:29.314
Position to lead truck.

12:31.416 --> 12:35.286
816 meters and closing,
25 miles an hour.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.689
Two-mil lead.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.970
Beckett, I need some help!

12:54.773 --> 12:57.241
Large rock, 750 meters.

12:57.242 --> 12:58.643
Two guys on foot.

13:06.985 --> 13:10.889
Guy with the AK, on the
ground, 800 meters.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.001
- Hostile threat down.
- Where's the target?

13:25.003 --> 13:27.171
Heading south, fast.

13:27.172 --> 13:29.415
Range me.

13:33.378 --> 13:34.779
Range is long gone.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.852
Call it in.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.019
Let's pack it up.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.092
Yeah.

13:45.290 --> 13:48.793
Hog's Den, Hog's Den,
this is North Star One.

13:48.794 --> 13:52.129
Hostile threat down.
Ready for evacuation, over.

13:52.130 --> 13:56.443
<i>Roger that, NS-One, move to
extraction point LZ-Cobra.</i>

13:57.069 --> 13:59.971
Hold your position.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.156
What the hell happened, Gunny?

15:25.157 --> 15:27.758
You'll read about it
in the report, sir.

15:27.759 --> 15:28.893
Reese?

15:28.894 --> 15:31.162
Yahoo, no discipline.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.631
That's why you're here,
to train these yahoos.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.399
Look around you.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.935
This is a work in progress,
not even the fucking paint's dry.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.570
We had him.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.839
Should've been clean, done.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.810
It was that bad?

15:45.410 --> 15:47.411
Worse.

15:47.412 --> 15:49.416
Reese got his spotter killed.

15:50.916 --> 15:54.160
Well, let me buy you a drink.
We'll talk it through.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.587
I want out, Major.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.489
What are you saying?

15:58.490 --> 16:01.158
You sent us into a country we
weren't even supposed to be in,

16:01.159 --> 16:03.427
with a team that wasn't
qualified for the job.

16:03.428 --> 16:05.529
We lost one today.
We'll get him next time.

16:05.530 --> 16:10.501
No, I had five kills today and we
were only sent out for one target.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.370
It's tough work.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.840
Not really, that's what bothers me.

16:15.841 --> 16:19.043
It was easy, five shots, five kills.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.846
I was on the scope, correcting
for wind and velocity,

16:21.847 --> 16:23.547
doing the trig work in
my head, on the fly.

16:23.548 --> 16:25.216
Yeah, it's just math.

16:25.217 --> 16:28.018
No, everything was easy.

16:28.019 --> 16:30.287
Second nature?

16:30.288 --> 16:32.289
Yeah.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.991
That's the goal.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.927
Congratulations, you're a sniper.

16:36.928 --> 16:40.531
It's what we do. Black on black.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.843
It's ugly stuff.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.674
You're not the first sniper
to question his destiny.

16:51.276 --> 16:53.553
We all do.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.120
You think I like to kill?

17:03.955 --> 17:06.198
I'm done.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.160
You're assigned to a
Multi-National Task Force

17:09.161 --> 17:12.329
authorized to carry weapons
in a foreign country!

17:12.329 --> 17:14.732
You can't just quit!

17:16.067 --> 17:18.913
You're a natural, kid.

17:19.871 --> 17:22.579
It's in your blood.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.624
You're 10 minutes late.

18:46.625 --> 18:51.228
Major, you still don't know when
you're talking to a superior?

18:51.229 --> 18:55.008
It's along time since we've had
a come-to-Jesus face to face.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.804
I'm not here.

18:59.804 --> 19:02.907
The rest of us are in the shit and
you're living the life out here.

19:02.908 --> 19:07.756
Way off the grid, out of the
grind, right where I need to be.

19:08.146 --> 19:12.858
You must rate some serious
juice with the brass stateside.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.763
Pete Steffen, you remember him?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.591
Yeah. Reasonably good man.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.165
Got shot in Berlin, two days ago.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.029
Shame.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.132
It would be a shame
if it was just Steffen.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.341
Hopkins and Carswell.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.102
Dead?

19:32.103 --> 19:35.539
Hopkins got popped nine
days ago in South Florida.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.007
Carswell?

19:37.008 --> 19:40.115
Medulla shot, two
days back in London.

19:40.645 --> 19:46.283
Shots were from 1,500 meters
with a high-caliber bullet.

19:46.284 --> 19:48.552
- How high?
- Fifty.

19:48.553 --> 19:52.022
That's not a just a kill,
that's a statement.

19:52.023 --> 19:55.960
It was a home-made bullet with
its own calculated spindrift.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.161
Conditions?

19:57.162 --> 20:01.131
Hopkins' shot required an
adjustment for extreme wind.

20:01.132 --> 20:03.636
- From 1,500 meters?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:04.235 --> 20:07.071
This guy's a serious motherfucker.

20:07.072 --> 20:10.174
Let's get the hell outta
of here. You hungry?

20:16.414 --> 20:18.015
Best octopus in the world.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.387
You brought me here
because you think I did it?

20:23.154 --> 20:24.355
Why would you say that?

20:24.356 --> 20:27.424
There are only a handful of
guys can make those shots,

20:27.425 --> 20:29.395
and I'm one of them.

20:30.228 --> 20:34.109
If I thought you did it,
we wouldn't be talking.

20:34.432 --> 20:36.066
Fair enough.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.868
We have three men dead out of five

20:37.869 --> 20:40.671
who were put together for a
particular mission in Afghanistan,

20:40.672 --> 20:43.540
a mission you turned down.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.042
Didn't see any upside in it.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.012
Everyone involved got a high-paying
job with the corporation

20:48.013 --> 20:49.213
when they got back home.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.749
With all due respect, sir, the men
that get those high-paying jobs

20:51.750 --> 20:55.290
end up about six feet lower
than I care to park my desk.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.388
Who do you think did it?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.768
Ideas or actionable intel?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.394
What's your gut say?

21:03.395 --> 21:06.196
Simpson. Got the raw talent.

21:06.197 --> 21:09.566
He just got back from Afghanistan
a couple months ago.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.802
Spent time in the psych
ward at Landstuhl.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.637
He's been in the shit too long.

21:13.638 --> 21:16.707
We think he's somewhere in Syria,
tracking one of our members.

21:16.708 --> 21:17.808
Shope?

21:17.809 --> 21:20.644
And we think your boy Beckett
might also be on his list.

21:20.645 --> 21:22.413
Why would he want Brandon?

21:22.414 --> 21:26.488
Because last night there
was a fourth killing.

21:41.666 --> 21:42.933
Thomas Beckett?

21:42.934 --> 21:44.869
He was taken out in Rome.

21:47.672 --> 21:51.212
<i>He was the best shooter I ever knew.</i>

21:52.577 --> 21:55.320
<i>Fucker could thread a needle.</i>

21:56.481 --> 21:58.655
So what are you gonna do about it?

21:59.484 --> 22:02.660
Find Simpson, shut him down.

22:09.861 --> 22:13.530
There's an ax coming through
your door, Colonel.

22:13.531 --> 22:15.666
And this island's not
so far off the grid.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.335
That's why I've got you.

22:18.336 --> 22:21.273
This is all the Intel we have.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.507
Sir.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.546
Hey.

22:27.178 --> 22:30.058
They still calling you Bullet-Face?

23:08.987 --> 23:12.766
So I hear you're lookin'
for a transfer?

23:12.991 --> 23:14.858
Word travels fast.

23:14.859 --> 23:16.393
When were you gonna tell me?

23:17.595 --> 23:21.165
- Sanaa, I...
- No, look... Fine, it's fine.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.170
Just thought we were friends.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.136
We are.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.539
- Doesn't feel like it sometimes.
- It does to me.

23:28.540 --> 23:32.109
It's so much easier for you guys,

23:32.110 --> 23:35.456
especially you with your legacy.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.517
My legacy?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.995
Wanna know why I became a sniper?

23:43.555 --> 23:45.627
Yeah.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.961
Republic of the Congo.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.696
A sniper took out my entire squad,

23:52.697 --> 23:55.099
missed killing me by
less than an inch.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.435
I don't believe in misses.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.537
The bullet either
wants you or doesn't.

24:00.538 --> 24:02.473
Hmm.

24:03.908 --> 24:05.409
Hey, Beckett!

24:05.410 --> 24:07.411
Bullet-Face is sending me home.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.947
You rat-fucked me.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.250
I did you a favor, Reese. Go home.

24:13.251 --> 24:15.919
The Green Jackets will be happy
to have their shooter back.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.697
We've got some business
to finish first.

24:22.126 --> 24:23.927
You really wanna do this?

24:23.928 --> 24:25.429
Oh, yeah.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.375
Fucking Beckett!

24:44.782 --> 24:46.850
So what was that all about?

24:46.851 --> 24:51.622
Just a couple of guys who kill for
a living getting into a bar fight.

24:51.623 --> 24:54.658
What are you doing here, Brandon?

24:54.659 --> 24:57.232
Chasin' a ghost.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.796
Thomas Beckett?

24:59.797 --> 25:03.200
Walkin' in the shadow of a giant.

25:04.469 --> 25:07.042
He's just a man, Brandon.

25:10.708 --> 25:15.055
I'll tell you a story about
a girl and her father.

25:15.346 --> 25:19.716
They lived in this small town
in the south of Lebanon.

25:20.184 --> 25:22.686
He was the mayor.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.454
He was working with the
police to try to stop

25:24.455 --> 25:27.357
local farmers from
growing heroin poppy.

25:30.194 --> 25:32.903
One day the girl came
home from school.

25:34.399 --> 25:39.042
She found her father's severed
head on the front steps.

25:39.737 --> 25:44.744
The police who had been hired to
protect him, assassinated him.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.744
I'm sorry.

25:47.745 --> 25:52.092
My mom picked up our lives
and moved us to Chicago.

25:52.817 --> 25:55.162
Never looked back.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.321
And you?

25:57.322 --> 25:58.956
I joined the Corps.

25:58.957 --> 26:01.625
Actually where I
realized I could shoot.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.827
Which brings me here,

26:03.828 --> 26:06.530
back in the Middle East,
shooting long-guns

26:06.531 --> 26:10.033
with you at the command
of Major Bidwell.

26:10.034 --> 26:13.039
I actually learned a lot from him.

26:15.340 --> 26:20.043
He taught me that no matter
what country you're in,

26:20.044 --> 26:23.982
you don't really know
who the bad guys are.

26:24.248 --> 26:27.217
So you find a shooter who you trust

26:27.218 --> 26:30.120
and join forces with him.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.972
Gunny?

26:49.273 --> 26:52.585
Get dressed, I need a minute.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.953
Major?

27:02.954 --> 27:06.590
I'm not good at small talking
over the facts of things,

27:06.591 --> 27:09.027
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

27:09.260 --> 27:13.835
A U.S. sniper went rogue and
killed several military officers.

27:14.265 --> 27:17.270
One of those men was your father.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.476
My father?

27:25.576 --> 27:28.012
I'm sorry, kid.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.816
How?

27:32.717 --> 27:34.051
Who?

27:34.052 --> 27:36.022
That's need to know.

27:37.655 --> 27:43.197
I know you never knew him and
maybe it doesn't matter to you,

27:44.662 --> 27:47.371
but he was the best
shooter I ever knew.

27:48.399 --> 27:50.676
He would've been proud of you.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.808
Is that it?

27:54.939 --> 27:59.377
No, I'm gonna take a small
team and tie this thing off.

28:00.411 --> 28:04.414
I can't take you with me
because the Colonel says so.

28:04.415 --> 28:06.483
Besides, you wouldn't
know how to keep

28:06.484 --> 28:09.419
on the trigger without
making it personal.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.621
This isn't personal for you?

28:11.622 --> 28:13.557
Yes, it is.

28:13.658 --> 28:16.401
But I know how to make it a job.

28:16.627 --> 28:20.098
Our training teaches us
not to personalize killing.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.533
I myself,

28:23.801 --> 28:26.942
I think there's something
to be said for revenge.

28:28.639 --> 28:30.474
So what are you saying?

28:30.475 --> 28:32.854
What I'm saying is,

28:33.511 --> 28:36.480
I hope you don't sneak off the base

28:36.481 --> 28:39.190
and take this thing
into your own hands.

28:39.784 --> 28:45.565
Because if you do, you will
be on loan-out to yourself.

28:46.157 --> 28:52.735
And if you get caught, I will throw
your ass under a fucking bus.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.068
Yes, Major.

29:01.572 --> 29:03.576
And, Gunny,

29:04.642 --> 29:07.385
I know he wasn't much of a father,

29:08.012 --> 29:11.085
but he was a hell of a man.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.284
How's it goin', Mango?

29:47.285 --> 29:49.352
Hey, Twinkle Toes Cantara.

29:49.353 --> 29:52.021
I'm spottin' for you on
this mission. I got your six.

29:52.022 --> 29:54.457
Oh, cool, man.

30:01.098 --> 30:05.802
We'll see ya, kid.
Wheel's up! Let's roll!

30:05.803 --> 30:07.804
Sir?

30:07.805 --> 30:10.307
- Where's Brandon?
- He's not making this trip.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.441
May I ask why?

30:11.442 --> 30:13.480
Nope. Load up!

30:44.642 --> 30:46.443
<i>This is Viper-One to Command Op,</i>

30:46.444 --> 30:49.613
<i>we're 600 klicks from
AFB Incirlik and rolling.</i>

30:49.614 --> 30:52.182
<i>ETA approximately five hours.</i>

30:52.183 --> 30:55.018
<i>Copy that, Viper-One.
Be safe out there.</i>

31:46.203 --> 31:47.871
<i>This is Tiger-Two Seven to Tower.</i>

31:47.872 --> 31:50.473
<i>We're ready and awaitin'
your command, over.</i>

31:50.474 --> 31:51.975
<i>This is Tower.</i>

31:51.976 --> 31:53.176
<i>You're cleared for take-off.</i>

31:53.177 --> 31:56.489
<i>Confirm Team Viper's on
board, ready for incursion.</i>

31:57.548 --> 32:01.088
<i>That's affirmative,
the team's locked and loaded.</i>

32:04.088 --> 32:07.223
<i>We are approximately 80
minutes from DZ Alpha Bravo.</i>

32:07.224 --> 32:10.104
<i>Roger that, Tiger-Two
Seven, be safe out there.</i>

33:32.977 --> 33:34.577
- Major Shope!
- Bidwell?

33:34.578 --> 33:36.312
Yeah.

33:36.313 --> 33:37.947
They call you Bullet-Face, right?

33:37.948 --> 33:40.150
I have heard that before, yes.

33:40.151 --> 33:43.395
This is Sanaa Malik, Eddie Cantara.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.921
Sniper?

33:44.922 --> 33:46.289
I prefer the word shooter.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.690
Okay.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.659
Now we know who we all are.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.629
Sol heard somebody wants me dead?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.864
Well, tell 'em to take a number.

33:54.865 --> 33:58.768
Everybody within a thousand
klicks of here wants me dead.

33:58.769 --> 34:02.505
Someone in particular, linked to
what you were doing in Afghanistan

34:02.506 --> 34:04.808
on April the 22nd, 2004.

34:04.809 --> 34:08.178
Yes, Sentinel.
I remember that mission.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.379
Afghanistan.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.382
We were escorting a group
of Army Intel out of theater.

34:12.382 --> 34:13.683
We were ambushed.

34:13.684 --> 34:18.487
It was a cluster fuck. We lost
half the men to friendly fire.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.630
Someone is killing every officer
who served on that mission.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.431
You're the last one alive.

35:01.398 --> 35:04.434
380 tons of heroin and
morphine is produced

35:04.435 --> 35:07.537
in Afghanistan and
trafficked up into Europe.

35:07.538 --> 35:10.540
The Heroin Highway starts
in the Helmand River Valley

35:10.541 --> 35:16.279
and moves through Iran, Iraq and
then into Syria before entering Turkey

35:16.280 --> 35:18.748
and making its way into Europe.

35:18.749 --> 35:22.218
These drugs bankroll terrorism
and it's our job to stop it.

35:22.219 --> 35:23.786
They move through small villages,

35:23.787 --> 35:27.725
sometimes forcing the local men
and women to work as slave labor.

35:30.861 --> 35:34.197
<i>These cartels are
protected by kill squads.</i>

35:34.198 --> 35:36.499
<i>At 1800 today, the group
we've been hunting</i>

35:36.500 --> 35:39.702
will deliver the heroin to a
town on the outskirts of Bayda

35:39.703 --> 35:42.539
in exchange for weapons.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.107
<i>My team's forward deployed.</i>

35:44.108 --> 35:46.543
<i>They're getting in position now.</i>

35:46.544 --> 35:50.013
We will be there to say
hello and fuck them up.

35:50.014 --> 35:52.115
In and out in 30 minutes.

35:52.116 --> 35:55.051
<i>This is an urban op, ladies.</i>

35:55.052 --> 35:58.187
I don't need to remind you
there's an 88% casualty rate.

35:58.188 --> 35:59.756
Don't silhouette, watch your angles

35:59.757 --> 36:01.724
and stay out of the fatal funnel.

36:01.725 --> 36:05.061
<i>The drugs and weapons
will be destroyed on site.</i>

36:05.062 --> 36:07.839
This is not a recovery mission.

36:07.865 --> 36:10.400
We leave zero signature.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.371
Questions?

36:20.277 --> 36:22.212
Thank you.

36:22.913 --> 36:24.447
Right.

36:24.448 --> 36:29.285
While Major Shope and your I.N.L.
team are busy fucking them up,

36:29.286 --> 36:33.089
my boys and girls will be on the
green-side providing long-range support.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.291
For those of you who skipped class,

36:35.292 --> 36:37.727
that's short for
sniping in the weeds.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.698
Thank you.

36:40.230 --> 36:44.567
We'll also be filling the surrounding
areas with these little babies.

36:44.568 --> 36:46.836
GSM surveillance devices,

36:46.837 --> 36:52.108
<i>real time HD audio and video
with an IR range of 60 feet.</i>

36:52.109 --> 36:55.445
<i>I'll be monitoring all the video
feeds on the crisis zone.</i>

36:55.446 --> 37:00.176
<i>If it moves with a gun,
we will watch it in HD.</i>

37:00.984 --> 37:05.822
Whoever shows up to
kill you is the bad guy.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.925
We've invited him with a stream
of unsecured radio chatter

37:08.926 --> 37:12.402
pinpointing the town and
your team's presence there.

37:14.765 --> 37:17.366
So, if this guy shows
you've got my back?

37:17.367 --> 37:18.301
We have.

37:18.302 --> 37:21.307
You any good with those
long-guns, Major?

37:21.705 --> 37:25.779
I'd rather take my long-guns,
than your short arms.

37:27.144 --> 37:29.079
Well said.

37:29.847 --> 37:31.919
Gear up.

37:33.283 --> 37:35.253
Let's get it done.

37:54.371 --> 37:56.973
YOUR PAPERS? IDENTIFICATION.

37:56.974 --> 37:59.409
I'm just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.380
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

38:03.981 --> 38:07.293
Come on, guys. Let's not do this.

38:41.018 --> 38:42.785
- Here it is.
- Good.

38:42.786 --> 38:45.666
800 meters out from
the center of town.

38:53.597 --> 38:57.706
Sir, if I may, why do they
call you Bullet-Face?

38:59.603 --> 39:02.605
I've had 74 confirmed kills.

39:02.606 --> 39:07.181
And 67 of those have
been face shots.

39:07.277 --> 39:10.214
- Quite a statement.
- More of a trademark.

39:11.648 --> 39:15.118
Sir, why did you leave
Brandon behind?

39:15.119 --> 39:18.693
There's more at play here
than you need to know about.

39:18.722 --> 39:22.796
But I do what's right in
the moment at the time.

39:23.127 --> 39:26.200
- You always know what's right for us?
- Yeah, pretty much.

39:26.797 --> 39:28.869
You think you could ever be wrong?

39:30.334 --> 39:32.508
Keeps me awake at night.

39:35.105 --> 39:38.178
Okay, get ghillied-up, play hide.

40:24.388 --> 40:27.957
Lots of friendlies out
there, no tangos.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.030
Roger that.

41:10.701 --> 41:14.904
Viper-Two, Viper-Two,
this is Viper-One, over.

41:14.905 --> 41:19.508
Viper-One, this is Viper-Two,
send your traffic, over.

41:19.509 --> 41:22.184
Watch your target
indicators down there.

41:22.512 --> 41:25.014
You've got shine, over.

41:25.015 --> 41:27.189
Roger that, over.

41:29.953 --> 41:32.457
Pantyhose. Sexy.

41:32.756 --> 41:36.092
If you saw half the shit I did
with this, you would blush.

41:36.093 --> 41:38.028
Fucking slut.

41:52.109 --> 41:54.545
Nice hide, Mango.

42:05.222 --> 42:08.758
We got movement, two o'clock, over.

42:25.409 --> 42:27.610
Stay frosty, Viper-Two.

42:27.611 --> 42:30.151
Safeties off.

42:54.304 --> 42:56.872
Any sign of Tango, over?

42:56.873 --> 42:58.708
Negative, over.

42:58.709 --> 43:00.543
Keep your eyes on the prize.

43:00.544 --> 43:02.878
Find me Simpson. Viper-One, out.

43:02.879 --> 43:05.087
Roger that.

43:13.623 --> 43:17.693
Major, how's everything
going out there?

43:17.694 --> 43:19.228
This shithead pushing
up daisies yet?

43:19.229 --> 43:21.163
I'm in the middle of it now.

43:21.164 --> 43:22.631
Gunnery Sergeant Beckett with you?

43:22.632 --> 43:24.333
He's confined to base.

43:24.334 --> 43:25.501
Is he?

43:25.502 --> 43:27.136
<i>That's where I left him.</i>

43:27.137 --> 43:30.643
Well, he's gone. Hasn't
been seen since yesterday.

43:32.009 --> 43:33.979
That's news to me.

43:34.211 --> 43:37.146
I'm starting to get a bad
feeling about this, Major.

43:37.147 --> 43:38.247
Finish it!

43:38.248 --> 43:41.817
So no pressure then. Just hurry up.

43:41.818 --> 43:44.163
Exactly, Major.

43:44.321 --> 43:45.921
No more Marines dying.

43:45.922 --> 43:47.994
Roger that.

43:57.567 --> 44:01.471
Okay, boys. Stay sharp now.

44:11.348 --> 44:14.950
Viper-One, Viper-One, got a
second truck at my 10 o'clock.

44:14.951 --> 44:17.296
Roger that, Viper-Two.

44:30.767 --> 44:35.444
Team Alpha, Team Bravo,
get ready to bound.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.788
Let's go.

45:00.397 --> 45:01.764
Team Charlie, you are on me.

45:01.765 --> 45:04.008
We're fire support.

45:04.968 --> 45:07.211
Take that window.

45:07.471 --> 45:09.475
You take that window.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.109
Shit. We're made.

45:47.110 --> 45:49.045
Shooter!

45:49.312 --> 45:51.413
Take them! Take them now!

46:12.869 --> 46:14.907
Which way? Which way?

46:30.987 --> 46:32.121
Should we engage?

46:32.122 --> 46:34.557
Protect Shope and look for
Tango. That's our mission.

46:34.558 --> 46:37.199
<i>Keep your head down on that scope.</i>

46:37.827 --> 46:41.765
Advance, advance! Move in!
Cover me! Cover me!

47:25.242 --> 47:28.918
Viper-Two, Viper-Two,
we've got enemy sniper fire.

47:35.118 --> 47:37.759
ATB Tangos, 11 o'clock.

47:39.856 --> 47:41.290
Fuck!

47:41.291 --> 47:44.467
Cantara? Cantara?

47:49.599 --> 47:52.568
Viper-One, Viper-One, this is
Viper-Two. I got a man down!

47:52.569 --> 47:55.537
They've got counter-sniper
support. How copy?

47:55.538 --> 47:57.473
Start shooting.

48:26.936 --> 48:28.270
We're pinned!

48:28.271 --> 48:31.344
We need to change this fucking game!

48:33.743 --> 48:35.678
Gotcha, bitch.

49:11.481 --> 49:13.649
Nice work. That's a game changer.

49:13.650 --> 49:15.756
It wasn't me.

49:16.186 --> 49:18.121
Brandon.

49:22.859 --> 49:24.526
Zaim!

49:24.527 --> 49:26.633
Zaim!

49:32.369 --> 49:34.475
LIGHT 'EM UP, ZAIM!

49:35.338 --> 49:37.478
LIGHT 'EM UP, ZAIM!

49:37.741 --> 49:39.711
RPG!

50:19.416 --> 50:21.049
- Move in! Move in!
- Hustle! Hustle!

50:21.050 --> 50:25.354
Let's push the perimeter! Fucking
push down, let's go! Move in!

50:25.355 --> 50:27.055
Go!

50:27.056 --> 50:29.091
Move in, rig the truck.

50:29.092 --> 50:30.225
Blow all the merch.

50:30.226 --> 50:32.867
Nothing gets back on the market!

51:27.016 --> 51:28.584
Anybody with me?

51:28.585 --> 51:30.319
<i>I'm here.</i>

51:30.320 --> 51:32.563
Cantara's gone.

51:39.762 --> 51:43.799
Corporal, you tough it out.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.934
This is a high stress event.

51:45.935 --> 51:47.905
It's the job.

51:48.171 --> 51:49.605
Clear!

51:49.606 --> 51:51.640
We're blowing this truck!

51:51.641 --> 51:53.952
Watch your backs!

51:58.815 --> 52:01.149
Well, that was a goat fuck, huh?

52:01.150 --> 52:03.852
Looks like your assassin
didn't get the invitation.

52:03.853 --> 52:05.854
Our Intel says he did!

52:05.855 --> 52:07.856
Yeah, well, your Intel can blow me!

52:07.857 --> 52:11.636
Job's done! Let's get
the fuck outta...

53:02.045 --> 53:04.583
Rookie mistake, Junior.

53:04.747 --> 53:07.449
The air is heavy, the light is low

53:07.450 --> 53:11.354
and you don't got the range
with that 308, do you, kid?

53:36.779 --> 53:38.722
Sleep tight, kid.

54:39.542 --> 54:44.720
<i>Be advised, be advised, we've got
an unidentified Marine coming in.</i>

55:05.802 --> 55:08.443
Identify yourself.

55:12.141 --> 55:14.976
Thomas Beckett, former
US Marine. Who are you?

55:14.977 --> 55:17.413
What the hell?

55:18.715 --> 55:21.617
The rumor was you were dead,
Master Gunnery Sergeant.

55:22.752 --> 55:25.020
I've been dead before, Major.

55:25.021 --> 55:28.590
Where is Gunnery Sergeant
Brandon Beckett?

55:28.591 --> 55:30.025
I left him back at the base.

55:30.026 --> 55:32.064
Bullshit, he was here.

55:32.662 --> 55:34.666
He's a resourceful kid.

55:35.565 --> 55:38.500
So, this is how you
take care of my son?

55:38.501 --> 55:41.036
Your son is a force recon
Marine Scout Sniper

55:41.037 --> 55:43.905
highly skilled in field
craft and marksmanship.

55:43.906 --> 55:47.676
The Corps has spent a lot of time and
money teaching him how to survive.

55:47.677 --> 55:52.753
Now, are you gonna tell me why
you're on this side of the ground?

55:53.116 --> 55:56.051
- Disappointed?
- A little.

55:56.052 --> 55:58.295
Takes a lot to kill a legend.

55:58.521 --> 56:00.589
If the assassin thought I was dead,

56:00.590 --> 56:03.225
I figured he'd do what you did.

56:03.226 --> 56:04.359
And what would I do?

56:04.360 --> 56:06.261
Go to the next man on the list.

56:06.262 --> 56:10.302
So, who is the sniper?

56:11.701 --> 56:16.173
- Army Ranger David Simpson.
- Simpson?

56:17.405 --> 56:19.842
Now that's a damn shame.

56:20.209 --> 56:24.613
I put some lead on him, but he was
too far for me to put his lights out.

56:25.281 --> 56:27.353
Master Guns?

56:27.884 --> 56:30.024
A word.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.294
What's on your mind, Major?

56:33.823 --> 56:39.194
To say you're a long way from
home is an understatement.

56:39.796 --> 56:42.430
We're in the middle
of the Middle East.

56:42.431 --> 56:45.038
Allah himself doesn't
know that we're here.

56:45.968 --> 56:47.435
So how do you?

56:47.436 --> 56:49.471
I know people, too.

56:49.472 --> 56:52.808
Are we playing on the same team?

56:52.809 --> 56:55.677
I'm playing to keep Brandon
alive, that's my mission.

56:55.678 --> 56:57.746
And to kill Simpson.

56:57.747 --> 57:01.321
My life, nah, my life's been lived.

57:30.213 --> 57:34.890
Sun will be up in a couple
of hours. We'll find this guy.

57:39.288 --> 57:41.360
Wait.

57:49.398 --> 57:52.642
This blood's fresh.
This was Simpson's hide.

57:54.070 --> 57:55.704
I'll track Brandon and Simpson.

57:55.705 --> 57:57.072
Yeah, we'll come with you.

57:57.073 --> 57:58.740
Negative, Major.

57:58.741 --> 58:00.909
I counted at least
two other combatants

58:00.910 --> 58:02.878
that lived through your
donnybrook and made it out.

58:02.879 --> 58:04.512
They could be working with Simpson.

58:04.513 --> 58:06.481
So you two have to go after them.

58:06.482 --> 58:08.516
I'll go west. I know that terrain.

58:08.517 --> 58:10.051
Yeah, I'll go to the east.

58:10.052 --> 58:13.296
So if this is more than just
Simpson, who are they working for?

58:14.357 --> 58:17.294
We'll ask whoever we leave alive.

58:17.493 --> 58:19.463
Happy hunting.

01:02:12.194 --> 01:02:14.266
Drop your fucking gun.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:32.647
Don't move. Put the weapon down.

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.618
I don't have one.

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.722
What are you doing?

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.955
I'm waiting for evac.

01:02:40.956 --> 01:02:42.891
Evac?

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.692
There's no evac coming for you.

01:02:44.693 --> 01:02:46.361
End of the road.

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.363
They promised.

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:50.368
Who's "they"?

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.735
My recruiter.

01:02:54.503 --> 01:02:56.473
My CO.

01:02:57.806 --> 01:02:59.776
All of 'em.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.914
What did they promise?

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:06.748
To know I was fighting for
something that mattered.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.821
I was doing good.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.056
Maybe you were.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.723
No.

01:03:15.724 --> 01:03:17.728
I wasn't.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.046
Your old man was out there with me

01:04:12.047 --> 01:04:15.791
and it did not do me any good
having him watch my six.

01:04:28.897 --> 01:04:30.832
Ah, ah, ah.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.243
Say hi to your old man
when you see him.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.738
- My father's dead.
- Is he?

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:40.586
- Well, you killed him.
- Well, I thought I did, but he's here.

01:04:41.076 --> 01:04:43.080
- Here?
- Yep.

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:46.154
He's on the scent,

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:49.086
doing what he does best.

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:57.258
Now, I want you to
do a favor for me.

01:04:57.259 --> 01:05:01.829
Tell your old man and the
Colonel that I'm coming for 'em.

01:05:03.832 --> 01:05:05.836
Don't you hate that?

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:37.068
- Let's talk.
- You cannot torture me.

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:40.468
Really? Who says?

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.780
Your government says.

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:51.986
I can do what the fuck
I like. I'm in Syria.

01:05:52.981 --> 01:05:56.718
You think my government sent
me here to follow the rules?

01:05:56.719 --> 01:06:00.688
They sent me here to take
down creeps like you.

01:06:00.689 --> 01:06:05.259
They don't ask me how
I do it and I don't tell.

01:06:07.262 --> 01:06:09.800
Don't ask, don't tell.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.872
Excuse me.

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.108
Won't be long.

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.509
Colonel.

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.078
- Sharpe's dead?
<i>- Yes, he is.</i>

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:26.047
And I got to find out
from a third party?

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.448
We've been busy.

01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:30.454
Understood. We got to
get this done, Major.

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.388
Listen, Colonel, I know
this thing has gone

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:37.463
a bit sideways and I'm
willing to wear that,

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.561
but I've got a piece of business
right in front of me now.

01:06:40.562 --> 01:06:41.929
What kind of business?

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:46.107
A captive hostile.
How far can I take this?

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:51.205
No limits. Major, don't let
this ax come to my door.

01:06:51.206 --> 01:06:53.483
Roger that.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:02.123
Now where were we?

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:10.698
Now you talk or you die.

01:07:39.788 --> 01:07:42.065
He's gone.

01:07:45.994 --> 01:07:48.032
Dad?

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.501
Hello, son.

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:05.980
You need to rendezvous
with the team.

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:09.016
You're a hard man to find,
Master Gunnery Sergeant.

01:08:09.017 --> 01:08:11.089
Yeah.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.729
I guess that's the idea.
Scout Sniper and all.

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.721
It's me.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.658
Easy, Master Guns.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.104
Still leaving the unit?

01:09:01.236 --> 01:09:03.513
I don't know.

01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:07.742
You're fighting a good war, Brandon.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.781
We're on the right side of it.

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:14.215
Yeah. Well, maybe I just
joined for the wrong reasons.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.356
You should go talk to him.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.393
I don't even know him.

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:30.332
And the next thing I knew, I became
him. I'm not sure where to begin.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:34.734
"Where the fuck you
been my whole life?"

01:09:34.736 --> 01:09:37.115
Start there.

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:42.314
Don't let this moment pass you.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:13.808
Look here, I know there's some
questions you want to ask me, Gunny.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:17.979
And I'm afraid you're not
gonna like the answers.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.515
A sniper is just not a father.

01:10:21.516 --> 01:10:25.090
I walked. It happened.

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:30.594
Should I go on or can we skip
this sad story with all its tears?

01:10:34.529 --> 01:10:38.706
Let's skip it. Let's
talk about the mission.

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.840
Okay.

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:45.543
- Simpson, the assassin...
- Simpson's working alone.

01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:48.848
Major?

01:10:49.277 --> 01:10:50.878
No, he was never with them.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:52.883
How do you know that?

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:56.617
Well, my guy turned out
to be quite talkative.

01:10:56.618 --> 01:10:58.686
- Huh.
- So how do we catch him?

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:02.523
Question.

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:04.525
Who sent all of you out here?

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:06.127
Who else?

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:08.195
The last thing Simpson
said to me was

01:11:08.196 --> 01:11:10.398
that he was gunning for
you and the Colonel.

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:11.966
Sounds like a trap to me.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.608
Or a misdirection.

01:11:14.636 --> 01:11:17.872
Maybe he wants us to lead him there.

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.081
The Colonel's in Santorini.

01:11:21.743 --> 01:11:24.045
In Greece?

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:26.084
That's his new pivot point?

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:28.487
Nice.

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:33.766
Well, looks like we'll
need a cruise ship.

01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:04.785
Him?

01:12:04.786 --> 01:12:07.121
He's the only one we didn't
take on the mission.

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:11.526
Welcome to the shit, Reese.
All right, let's load up.

01:12:17.365 --> 01:12:20.506
Reese, we good?

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.570
I'm good.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.882
Unless you wanna go again?

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:28.144
Not really. But we can.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:32.786
Let's not. You kicked
my ass the first time.

01:12:43.091 --> 01:12:44.825
Are these scanners operational?

01:12:44.826 --> 01:12:46.327
They should be.

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:47.595
What do you got in mind?

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:51.298
You said this shooter uses a
remote control firing platform.

01:12:51.299 --> 01:12:54.101
Remote-firing systems are
linked in to cell signals.

01:12:54.102 --> 01:12:56.270
With a cell-tuned scanner,
I could pinpoint

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:59.208
the exact location of
his firing platform.

01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:03.480
Get on that.

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.354
So, who is this guy anyway?

01:13:08.416 --> 01:13:09.950
He's working for someone.

01:13:09.951 --> 01:13:11.652
Or he's crazy.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.657
Or both.

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:20.998
I hunted this kid once.

01:13:21.596 --> 01:13:24.198
He did the hero side of Afghanistan

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:26.300
from the Fifth Stryker Brigade.

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:29.238
A 15-month deployment in
the Helmand River Valley.

01:13:29.437 --> 01:13:33.250
Heavy action, really heavy.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:38.913
You know, he was a good Marine,

01:13:39.347 --> 01:13:42.386
but it got to his soul.

01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:46.527
Messed him up really good.

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:53.128
The psychs tagged him with PTSD,
but they didn't discharge him.

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:56.874
They didn't really treat him either.

01:13:58.033 --> 01:14:01.812
For three months he wandered
the base with a weapon.

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:07.041
January first,
he went into his hooch,

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:11.549
grabbed his weapon and he
shot up a New Year's Party.

01:14:11.746 --> 01:14:15.957
Then he trekked up to
Yosemite National Forest.

01:14:16.184 --> 01:14:20.065
No food, no shelter,

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:23.900
temperatures dropping
below freezing.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:31.066
When we finally spotted him, he was
up the mountain above the snow line.

01:14:33.668 --> 01:14:39.745
Just sitting there, staring
into dawn's early light.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:45.758
And then he ate his gun.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:49.290
If Simpson's broken,

01:14:49.851 --> 01:14:52.753
he makes a perfect
puppet for the Colonel.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.758
What? You think he's in on this?

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.128
I sure hope to God he's not.

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.385
You don't drink coffee?

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:58.721
Not much.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.755
No bad habits?

01:16:01.022 --> 01:16:03.196
I like cars.

01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:05.626
That's a bad habit?

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:07.597
It is if they're expensive.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:10.371
How about you?

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.241
I like to fish.

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:21.848
Well, maybe we'll
cast a line someday.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.385
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah.

01:16:29.617 --> 01:16:32.337
Might want to get square,
if you're gonna go see a colonel.

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:41.229
Right.

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:48.902
If you get this Simpson
in your sights,

01:16:48.903 --> 01:16:50.804
you put some hot lead into him.

01:16:50.805 --> 01:16:52.877
One shot, one kill.

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:54.909
Yes, sir.

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.978
Brandon?

01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:03.886
You hold my weapon.

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:07.088
Master Guns.

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:36.180
Excuse me, sir.
You have a phone call.

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:39.353
Excuse me, please.

01:18:39.914 --> 01:18:41.315
Yes, who's this?

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:44.389
Former Master Gunnery
Sergeant Thomas Beckett, sir.

01:18:44.752 --> 01:18:46.353
Beckett?

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.488
Thought you were dead.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:51.125
You mean you heard I was dead,
but I'm betting you didn't believe it.

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:52.426
That's true.

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:53.527
Where are you?

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.962
<i>On my way to see you.</i>

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:56.898
Are you close?

01:18:57.098 --> 01:18:58.198
Very.

01:18:58.199 --> 01:19:00.167
<i>Should I send someone?</i>

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.869
No, I'll cab it.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.804
1322 Thira Drive.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:06.013
<i>I know, over.</i>

01:19:31.866 --> 01:19:34.370
<i>Say your positions, everybody.</i>

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:46.240
Keep your eyes on the perimeter.

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.176
Scanning.

01:20:50.945 --> 01:20:54.155
If Simpson's here, I want him dead.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:11.394
Wow. Nice office.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:14.769
You certainly made a
deal with the devil, sir.

01:22:15.496 --> 01:22:17.230
This is a breach of protocol.

01:22:17.231 --> 01:22:19.576
You didn't have to see me, Colonel.

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:24.538
You call me up from the grave
and expect me not to respond?

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.906
Do you know who I have up there?

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:27.979
Yeah.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.443
The, uh...

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:32.346
The US Attorney
General, Phil Daniels,

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:35.955
the esteemed Senator
from North Dakota,

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:39.286
and the Syrian Rebel Forces.

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:42.827
And from the looks of it,
a couple of <i>Playboy</i> Bunnies.

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:48.173
Well, we don't all wear a
ghillie suit and creep around.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.531
Question.

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.933
Did you send an assassin to track me

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:55.068
and the other members
of Mission Sentinel?

01:22:55.069 --> 01:22:58.372
If I sent a kill squad for you,

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:01.275
you would not be here
having this conversation.

01:23:01.442 --> 01:23:04.822
Damn, Thomas, we go back a long way.

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.956
Yeah, yep.

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.084
- Twenty-five years.
- That's right.

01:23:11.085 --> 01:23:13.453
So, if you think I'm
gonna stand here

01:23:13.454 --> 01:23:15.455
and let you point your
finger in my face,

01:23:15.456 --> 01:23:16.990
you can go to straight
to hell, Beckett.

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.392
Well, then tell me what's happening.

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:21.495
What's happening is David Simpson.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:24.876
He's been in the game too
long and he had a meltdown.

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:29.336
And let me tell you something,
there is no conspiracy here.

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:31.375
I'm telling you what I know.

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:38.812
Well, tell me something, Colonel,

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:43.388
does this, um, black-on-black
work ever wear you out?

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:50.024
Yeah, it does,
when I think about it.

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:54.366
- How's Brandon?
- Ah...

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:58.042
Sins of the father, I guess.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:04.771
You've given up a lot for
your country, Master Guns.

01:24:04.772 --> 01:24:07.845
Maybe it's time you
consider a change of venue.

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:10.944
You can have any job you want.

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:14.883
Because by far, you are the
best Marine I have ever known.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.554
Gunshot came from my six.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.866
<i>Find him and shut him down.</i>

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.892
- Get me a location, Malik.
- I'm on it.

01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:29.603
God damn it, Thomas!
You've led him right to me.

01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:45.219
If he's using a remote
platform, I'm not seeing it.

01:24:53.187 --> 01:24:56.260
Got him, 2,600 meters out.

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:06.107
<i>Missed, too far down range.</i>

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:12.449
He's on the move, headed
southbound on the ridge-line.

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:15.409
Roger that, on my way.

01:25:41.235 --> 01:25:42.903
I've got a visual on him.

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.804
If you have a shot, take it.

01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:48.379
<i>That's a negative, I'm in pursuit
on the southbound trail.</i>

01:26:37.658 --> 01:26:39.593
Fuck.

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:41.361
Put the weapon down.

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.332
Don't do it!

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:48.041
Don't do it.

01:26:51.939 --> 01:26:54.975
Vintage Remington 308.

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.977
Not the best for accuracy.

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:59.880
Blow his fucking head off, Sarge!

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.792
Talk to me, Malik.

01:27:41.822 --> 01:27:43.826
I'm getting a weak signal.

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:08.782
There's no signal with
a remote, Brandon.

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:10.617
I've got the eastern side
of the ruins covered.

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:11.851
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:28:11.852 --> 01:28:14.421
I'm gonna draw him out.
Watch for movement.

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.056
I'm on the scope, kid.

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:19.028
Waiting to get a vector
on his position.

01:28:31.138 --> 01:28:33.740
Give it up, Simpson! You're done!

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:36.052
This ends badly for you!

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.983
Any reading on that
frequency yet, Malik?

01:28:43.984 --> 01:28:45.552
I got it.

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:48.626
1,200 meters to the west,
headed there now.

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.385
Isn't this fun?

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:16.218
Let's get to it, Junior!

01:29:25.192 --> 01:29:27.503
<i>I missed. He's still in play.</i>

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:34.434
Remote platform's not here.
He must have scrambled the signal.

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:36.102
I'm on my way down.

01:29:41.842 --> 01:29:44.244
What happened to you, Simpson?

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.780
They lied!

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:48.648
I read the reports.

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:51.351
No one ordered you to
fire on your own team.

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:54.554
It was an accident, friendly fire.

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:56.523
It wasn't an accident.

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:58.458
I was under orders.

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.661
They made me do it.

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.806
It was not my fault!

01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:35.002
Welcome to my kill zone, Junior.

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.522
Come on!

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.171
Toss it now.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.675
Get the fuck up.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.623
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.052
Why shouldn't I?

01:31:33.053 --> 01:31:35.321
This is my last hurrah.

01:31:40.594 --> 01:31:43.062
The field sniper is a dinosaur.

01:31:43.063 --> 01:31:47.069
You're extinct and you're
right in my kill zone.

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:03.592
Now you're right in my kill zone.

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.825
Fucking Beckett.

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.106
Two shots, one kill.

01:32:27.107 --> 01:32:29.275
You slipping, Master Guns?

01:32:29.276 --> 01:32:31.211
It was intended.

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:34.147
The first shot was
just to let him know.

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:36.118
Let him know?

01:32:36.283 --> 01:32:40.687
Yeah, let him know
he was about to die.

01:32:58.172 --> 01:33:01.040
<i>I feel it coming down</i>

01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:03.576
<i>Lying on the ground</i>

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:05.645
<i>Kingdom's never safe</i>

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:08.481
<i>When the king is fooling 'round</i>

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.917
<i>A lighthouse on a hill</i>

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.553
<i>A wave that never breaks</i>

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:17.323
<i>I throw all my regrets into the sun</i>

01:33:17.324 --> 01:33:20.431
<i>As the sea forgets</i>

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:26.099
<i>You take the key from my hand</i>

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:30.536
<i>You press the button and reset</i>

01:33:30.537 --> 01:33:36.284
<i>I shout, I shout,
I shout out at the sky</i>

01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:40.446
<i>From the roof of my car, oh</i>

01:33:40.447 --> 01:33:46.194
<i>I shout, I shout out into the night</i>

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.794
<i>I need some answers right now, oh</i>

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.538
You got a phone call.

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:04.971
Hello?

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:07.476
Gunnery Sergeant Beckett.

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:09.409
<i>Yes, Colonel.</i>

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:12.483
I wanted to thank you
for being a good Marine.

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.247
Not necessary, sir.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:15.948
<i>We tied this off,</i>

01:34:15.949 --> 01:34:17.750
you did most of the heavy lifting.

01:34:17.751 --> 01:34:20.386
That kind of work hits my radar.

01:34:20.387 --> 01:34:22.989
Thank you, sir. Is that all?

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.757
I understand you put in
a request for leave.

01:34:24.758 --> 01:34:26.592
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:34:26.593 --> 01:34:28.327
Just trying to sort some things out.

01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:32.732
I get it, take some
time, get some rest.

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:35.906
But when you come up for air,

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:38.541
I'll be that knock at your door.

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.911
Forgive me if I don't answer, sir.

01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:45.411
You'll answer.

01:34:45.412 --> 01:34:46.746
Are you sure about that?

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:50.389
This work we do, it's in your
DNA. Its who you are.

01:34:50.617 --> 01:34:54.259
So, yeah, I'm sure about that.

01:34:54.521 --> 01:34:58.024
<i>There is one more thing though.
There's been no decision yet,</i>

01:34:58.025 --> 01:35:00.026
but if things stack up,

01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:02.795
there's a chance you might
see a lot more of your dad.

01:35:02.796 --> 01:35:04.530
How so?

01:35:04.531 --> 01:35:06.842
He's gonna be your new CO.

01:35:09.536 --> 01:35:11.537
Take care of that arm, Colonel.

01:35:11.538 --> 01:35:13.806
Oh, and find yourself a new island.

01:35:13.807 --> 01:35:15.913
That hide's been compromised.

01:35:16.176 --> 01:35:18.311
Already done.

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:23.449
<i>Swim into the ocean</i>

01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:28.321
<i>Lift yourself up off the floor</i>

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:34.296
<i>An army on the street</i>

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:39.974
<i>Marching to the beat, oh</i>

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:45.471
<i>I shout, I shout</i>

01:35:45.472 --> 01:35:50.476
<i>I shout</i>

01:35:50.477 --> 01:35:56.417
<i>I shout, I shout,
I shout out at the sky</i>

01:35:56.650 --> 01:36:00.419
<i>From the roof of my car, oh</i>

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:06.167
<i>I shout, I shout out into the night</i>

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.429
<i>I need some answers right now, oh</i>

01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:13.499
<i>Communication</i>

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:16.778
<i>Why don't you call me?</i>

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:19.316
<i>Call me</i>

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:23.576
<i>Communication</i>

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:26.855
<i>Why don't you call me?</i>

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:28.982
<i>Call me</i>

01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:35.208
