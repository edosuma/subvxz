WEBVTT

00:04.218 --> 00:05.437
Web shooters.

00:06.144 --> 00:07.846
Proportionate strength
of a spider.

00:07.909 --> 00:11.558
And it still takes me just as long to
organize this place as anyone else.

00:11.683 --> 00:12.910
Who knew science
was so messy?

00:13.005 --> 00:14.972
He shoots, he...

00:16.855 --> 00:19.175
hits his teacher
with a dirty rag.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.524
Sorry, Max. It's
quite all right, Peter.

00:22.774 --> 00:24.587
I'm just happy to see you balancing out

00:24.645 --> 00:27.095
your science work
with a little athleticism.

00:27.207 --> 00:30.173
I make room when I can.
Speaking of which,

00:30.243 --> 00:33.457
since Tony Stark took the V-252
back to the Avengers Compound,

00:33.524 --> 00:35.591
do you want me to put
its container in storage?

00:35.658 --> 00:38.579
No, that's okay.
It's really no bother.

00:38.751 --> 00:40.463
In fact, we'll have
more room for...

00:40.530 --> 00:43.259
I said no, Peter. I, uh...

00:43.477 --> 00:46.759
I like it there. Sort of reminds
me of what could've been.

00:46.899 --> 00:50.048
Oh. I get it.
Sorry, Max.

00:50.196 --> 00:52.712
No worries. In fact,
why don't you head home?

00:52.813 --> 00:55.126
You can come in early and
finish up in the morning.

00:55.407 --> 00:58.118
I can't.
I promised Flash Thompson

00:58.188 --> 01:01.218
- I'd tutor him before school tomorrow.
- Flash Thompson?

01:01.485 --> 01:03.946
The Midtown lad
who won the Stark Expo?

01:04.040 --> 01:06.415
Don't remind me.
Flash got lucky.

01:06.626 --> 01:10.056
And I'll have my work cut out for me if I'm
going to teach him anything about science.

01:10.199 --> 01:13.303
People can surprise you, Peter.
You're a perfect example.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.696
I never would've thought
you'd agree to tutor the boy

01:15.759 --> 01:18.126
who caused you so much grief
at Midtown.

01:18.267 --> 01:22.345
Well, he did something I didn't expect.
He asked for my help.

01:22.477 --> 01:24.571
See? He's off
to a good start.

01:24.845 --> 01:26.501
And he's quite
the football star.

01:26.626 --> 01:29.368
I'm looking forward
to seeing him play this weekend.

01:29.462 --> 01:32.743
Tell you what.
Let's call it a night anyway.

01:32.806 --> 01:34.977
I can straighten
these things up on my own.

01:35.068 --> 01:37.868
You sure? Thanks, Max.

01:39.602 --> 01:41.384
Oh, yeah! Getting out

01:41.508 --> 01:43.704
earlier than expected,
and not a mugger in sight.

01:43.821 --> 01:46.044
I might actually get a good
night's sleep for a change.

01:46.102 --> 01:48.579
Whoo-hoo-hoo... Ah!

01:48.743 --> 01:53.118
Uh, hello, spider-sense?

01:53.243 --> 01:55.579
Let me know the next time
you're gonna take a vacation.

01:55.673 --> 01:58.352
I don't like being
caught off guard by...

01:59.227 --> 02:01.509
Is that the black suit?

02:01.826 --> 02:04.093
Is that my black suit?

02:06.462 --> 02:09.368
And all this time,
I thought black was slimming.

02:10.138 --> 02:13.442

02:21.306 --> 02:24.337
So this is what it was
like to fight me in this costume.

02:25.752 --> 02:29.220
Well, a larger,
more monstrous version of me

02:29.454 --> 02:32.767
who's clearly taken the V-252
to a much darker place.

02:36.993 --> 02:39.079
'Cause from that wet,
gnarly grin,

02:39.144 --> 02:42.376
I'd say the "V"
stood for "Venom"!

02:43.001 --> 02:45.802
Whoa! My spider-sense
still isn't working!

02:45.860 --> 02:48.017
Can it not sense the Symbiote?

02:48.134 --> 02:51.056
Either way, looks like I need
to rely on my other gifts.

02:51.948 --> 02:53.504
I don't mean bowling!

02:53.617 --> 02:56.261
Although...

02:56.753 --> 02:58.644
I'm still going for the strike!

03:01.182 --> 03:04.403
I know the V-252's
securely at Avengers Tower.

03:06.043 --> 03:08.229
So are you another one?

03:09.113 --> 03:11.569
'Cause it seems unlikely
it could've escaped, unless...

03:11.803 --> 03:14.356
Unless it bonded with Tony
before he could contain it.

03:14.414 --> 03:16.633
Mr. Stark, is that you?

03:16.923 --> 03:20.737
If it is, you should know you're
really stretching out my suit.

03:20.869 --> 03:23.149
Unless you're just
looking to see who wore it best!

03:24.433 --> 03:25.579
In which case,

03:25.637 --> 03:27.943
let's just say I turned a lot
of heads wearing that thing.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.562
Not like Tony to
put people in harm's way.

03:31.668 --> 03:34.412
But I have to remember the suit

03:34.478 --> 03:37.015
made me do a lot of things
I didn't want to either.

03:39.047 --> 03:40.465
Like throwing a bus!

03:40.750 --> 03:43.042
Definitely wouldn't
throw a bus!

03:50.271 --> 03:53.189
That's right.
You don't like that, do you?

03:53.374 --> 03:56.225
Let's see what a cacophony
of car alarms sounds like.

04:00.137 --> 04:02.922
I was just showing off that
I knew what "cacophony" meant.

04:05.304 --> 04:07.135
And now he's gone.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.720
Guess there's only one way of knowing if
the Symbiote has taken over Tony Stark,

04:13.845 --> 04:16.478
and that's for Spidey
to ask him directly.

04:17.356 --> 04:20.709
Tony! It's your old pal, Spidey.

04:21.140 --> 04:24.302
Too friendly.
Mr. Stark, Spider-Man.

04:24.393 --> 04:26.679
Remember that V-252 you took?

04:26.832 --> 04:29.616
It didn't, by chance,
take over your mind, did it?

04:30.514 --> 04:31.960
Too direct.

04:32.885 --> 04:35.197
Mr. Stark, it's Spider-Man,

04:35.343 --> 04:39.031
and depending on how you answer this
question, you may need my help.

04:40.106 --> 04:43.386
Oh-ho-ho, that's good!
That's gooood.

04:44.961 --> 04:46.125
Call Tony Stark.

04:46.237 --> 04:48.045
<i>Leave a message.</i>

04:48.243 --> 04:52.337
Uh, hi. This is Spider-Man
with a message for Tony Stark.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.452
Mr. Stark, depending on how you
answer this question,

04:55.510 --> 04:57.352
I may need your help.

04:57.581 --> 04:59.852
You may need your help!
My help!

05:02.320 --> 05:03.614
Call me back, please.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.052
Real smooth, Parker.

05:09.112 --> 05:10.917
And monoammonium phosphate

05:10.975 --> 05:13.278
is a compound
that can separate the...

05:13.377 --> 05:15.776
- Flash!
- Huh? What? What? What?

05:15.868 --> 05:18.521
<i>You're</i> the one who asked
<i>me</i> here, remember?

05:18.865 --> 05:22.575
Now, do you wanna learn about the exciting
world of chemical compounds, or not?

05:22.833 --> 05:25.230
To be honest,
Parker, I could care less.

05:25.322 --> 05:27.568
But my grades are down,
and Mr. Salerno says

05:27.626 --> 05:29.446
if I don't pass
tomorrow's science exam,

05:29.534 --> 05:31.732
I can't play
in the big game this weekend.

05:32.226 --> 05:36.436
So? I'm not the biggest sports fan,
but... won't there be other games?

05:36.774 --> 05:37.999
Are you kidding me?

05:38.057 --> 05:41.437
This game is against
our biggest rival, Truman High.

05:41.530 --> 05:43.267
And I may not be much
in the classroom,

05:43.373 --> 05:45.671
but I am the king
of the football field!

05:49.197 --> 05:50.856
A nerd like you
couldn't understand

05:50.914 --> 05:52.689
the pressures of being a hero.

05:52.768 --> 05:56.594
- A hero? Yeah, right.
- Well, well, well!

05:56.825 --> 05:59.869
If it isn't
Flash-In-The-Pan Thompson!

05:59.955 --> 06:01.720
Kevin Wyatt.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.442
I forgot Truman High's quarter-hack
has family in this neighborhood.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.520
What do you want?

06:06.578 --> 06:08.872
I wanna see
you eat turf this weekend.

06:08.930 --> 06:11.825
But rumor has it
you won't be able to play

06:11.889 --> 06:14.388
'cause your grades are
no good.

06:17.279 --> 06:19.480
Keep it up, and you
won't be able to play

06:19.538 --> 06:21.765
'cause your <i> legs</i>
are no good!

06:22.076 --> 06:25.102
Flash, getting in a fight
isn't going to solve anything.

06:25.167 --> 06:28.209
Better listen to your
nerd buddy, Thompson.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.938
Nicely played, Flash.

06:31.229 --> 06:34.352
If you really wanna stick
it to him, ace this test.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.556
Then you can settle
your argument on the field.

06:36.828 --> 06:39.303
You really think I can pass,
tiny tutor?

06:39.361 --> 06:41.539
Is an amoeba
a single-celled organism?

06:41.725 --> 06:43.548
Huh? I don't know!

06:48.967 --> 06:51.833
Still no word from Tony.
That's not good.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.136
'Cause if the Symbiote was looking
for a host like its original,

06:55.368 --> 06:58.744
Tony and I are both smart,
we're both superheroes,

06:58.839 --> 07:01.801
and we were both
in close contact with the V-252.

07:01.976 --> 07:03.230
- Peter.
- Aah!

07:03.481 --> 07:04.595
Didn't mean to startle you.

07:04.689 --> 07:07.885
I just saw your...
your door open.

07:08.407 --> 07:09.760
That's all right.

07:10.201 --> 07:12.491
You okay, Max?
You look tired.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.593
Oh, I've been working late
most nights.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.627
It's probably just
catching up with me.

07:16.694 --> 07:17.739
What are you busy with?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.706
Well, I'm devising a way
to track the V-252.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.791
Why? We know exactly
where it is.

07:22.897 --> 07:25.130
Tony took it to Avengers
Compound, remember?

07:25.262 --> 07:29.763
Yeah, but Spider-Man told me
he thought he saw it last night,

07:29.829 --> 07:31.507
and I started to wonder.

07:31.908 --> 07:34.436
What if the Symbiote
bonded with Mr. Stark?

07:34.674 --> 07:37.433
Hmm.
That could be catastrophic.

07:38.306 --> 07:39.898
Fortunately,
I know for a fact

07:39.958 --> 07:42.834
that Tony is off-planet with the
Avengers on a secret mission.

07:43.072 --> 07:44.171
Really?

07:44.352 --> 07:47.339
That's a relief.
I think.

07:47.658 --> 07:48.680
What do you mean?

07:48.738 --> 07:52.224
Well, that means it's not Tony.
But it's still out there.

07:52.363 --> 07:55.634
And Spider-Man says his
spider-sense is useless against it.

07:55.926 --> 07:58.537
Which is why I'm working
on a way to track it.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.788
Didn't you say once
that the Symbiote gave off

08:00.846 --> 08:03.474
a unique quantum oscillation
of 35 gigahertz?

08:03.574 --> 08:05.883
It was actually 38 gigahertz.

08:05.995 --> 08:09.845
But... I really don't want you
getting involved in this, Peter.

08:10.011 --> 08:14.262
Promise me you'll leave the
dangerous stuff to the superheroes.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.618
You have my word.

08:18.103 --> 08:20.223
Technically,
I wasn't lying to Max,

08:20.283 --> 08:22.012
since I am a superhero,

08:22.250 --> 08:24.317
but I still don't
feel good about it.

08:24.692 --> 08:27.236
Fortunately, the data
he gave me comes in handy.

08:28.185 --> 08:29.242
There!

08:29.316 --> 08:32.508
Instead of a GPS,
I've made myself a VPS:

08:32.937 --> 08:34.604
Venom Positioning System.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.806
- <i>Let's get started.</i>
- After you.

08:39.216 --> 08:43.025
<i>Venom Symbiote detected.
Turn right on Broadway.</i>

08:43.357 --> 08:46.916
Yes! Once again,
science gets the upper hand!

08:48.342 --> 08:50.757
And with the sonic blaster
attached to my glove,

08:50.856 --> 08:53.036
that hand is gonna feel
like a fist.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.759
<i>Swing left at 47th Street.</i>

09:02.539 --> 09:03.899
Okay, Venom.

09:04.064 --> 09:07.172
Let's see how you feel when someone
sneaks up on you undetected.

09:07.230 --> 09:09.023
- <i>Arriving at your destination.</i>
- Huh?

09:09.081 --> 09:11.202
Oh, come on!

09:11.407 --> 09:14.760
You ruined my surpri...

09:17.600 --> 09:19.173
Everybody, get to safety!

09:19.231 --> 09:21.702
And while you're at it,
cover your ears!

09:27.513 --> 09:31.669
He's neutralizing the sonic blasts
with the lead in those manhole covers!

09:34.455 --> 09:36.401
My sonic blaster!

09:41.907 --> 09:43.742
<i>Venom approaching.</i>

09:44.731 --> 09:46.253
Tell me something I don't know!

09:47.962 --> 09:50.610
Phone, call Max's fax machine!

09:50.703 --> 09:51.952
<i>Dialing.</i>

09:59.001 --> 10:01.371
Thank goodness
for dated technology.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.542
Where'd he go?

10:06.092 --> 10:09.192
Gone. And it looks like the
VPS was damaged in the fight.

10:09.303 --> 10:11.440
Based on that move
with the manhole covers,

10:11.498 --> 10:13.688
I wasn't wrong about Venom
being somewhat smart.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.305
But with Tony Stark
off the suspect list,

10:16.391 --> 10:18.241
who's another person
that fits the bill?

10:18.308 --> 10:21.442
Everyone at Horizon High
has had access to the V-252.

10:21.593 --> 10:23.188
Gwen, Anya...

10:23.442 --> 10:25.431
Miles has powers
similar to mine.

10:25.911 --> 10:28.156
He doesn't quite
match Venom's size.

10:28.374 --> 10:31.550
Maybe Max can give me a list of
all the people who worked on it.

10:31.655 --> 10:34.269
Wait a minute.
What about Max?

10:34.798 --> 10:36.436
He's had the most
exposure to it.

10:36.494 --> 10:38.153
He's certainly smart enough.

10:38.325 --> 10:40.430
Not to mention
he's a pretty big guy.

10:40.714 --> 10:42.524
This needs some looking into.

10:46.537 --> 10:49.816
I won't be able to snoop
until he leaves for the day.

10:50.129 --> 10:51.547
So it's a good time to check in

10:51.612 --> 10:55.392
- on Flash at Midtown...
- Nerd alert! Puny Parker in the house!

10:57.488 --> 10:58.990
Sorry, tiny tutor.

10:59.067 --> 11:02.735
- Gotta keep up appearances, you know?
- What's going on here?

11:02.915 --> 11:06.150
Flash, I've told you
a hundred times not to...

11:06.297 --> 11:08.693
Peter Parker?
Is that you?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.387
It is, Mr. Salerno.
How have you been?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.565
Well, I've been better,
Peter.

11:13.648 --> 11:15.653
Ouch!
I can see that.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.619
What I mean is,
I'm having a hard time

11:17.677 --> 11:20.300
losing good students
like yourself to Horizon High.

11:20.390 --> 11:24.099
In fact, I've been petitioning to
stop Max Modell from recruiting here.

11:24.192 --> 11:26.032
He's well aware
of it, sir.

11:26.113 --> 11:28.146
And, while I know
it upsets him,

11:28.235 --> 11:29.959
I understand
your point too.

11:30.030 --> 11:32.519
But... what I meant was,
what happened to your arm?

11:32.577 --> 11:33.657
Oh, that.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.475
Well, I was in a bus accident,
believe it or not.

11:36.598 --> 11:38.781
A strange creature
attacked us.

11:39.479 --> 11:40.479
Really?

11:40.584 --> 11:42.517
But what brings you
to Midtown?

11:42.585 --> 11:44.937
Not a need to be picked on
by Flash, I hope.

11:45.036 --> 11:48.490
Oh! I don't know, I was tutoring Flash
for your big exam.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.327
I should've guessed,

11:50.387 --> 11:54.297
because Flash <i> passed</i>
with flying colors.

11:54.355 --> 11:55.729
I... I did?

11:55.787 --> 11:57.253
He... He did?

11:57.317 --> 11:58.796
Yes!

11:59.139 --> 12:03.054
Now you can see me kick Truman
High's butt tonight! Yeah!

12:03.193 --> 12:06.673
Oh, I... I wasn't actually
planning on going to the game.

12:06.731 --> 12:08.392
I mean, I don't know
if I can...

12:08.524 --> 12:12.000
My God! Oh ho ho!
You are so there, tiny tutor!

12:14.560 --> 12:17.591
I don't wanna believe Max
could actually be Venom.

12:17.764 --> 12:20.794
But that attack on Mr. Salerno's
a pretty big clue.

12:20.992 --> 12:23.638
Come to think of it,
Max was overly concerned

12:23.757 --> 12:26.872
about keeping the V-252 canister
in his office.

12:27.322 --> 12:28.856
Luckily, he's gone for the day,

12:28.920 --> 12:30.532
and I can check out
its usage...

12:30.649 --> 12:31.995
M-Max!

12:32.716 --> 12:35.233
I-I thought you were
going to the big game.

12:35.398 --> 12:37.546
I was hoping to,
but it dawned on me

12:37.604 --> 12:41.403
that with Sal Salerno petitioning to
keep me from recruiting at Midtown,

12:41.631 --> 12:43.661
it might not be
the best idea.

12:43.998 --> 12:45.671
Oh. I see.

12:45.729 --> 12:48.184
Oh! But you better run
if you're gonna make it on time.

12:48.263 --> 12:50.753
Yeah. I
guess you're right.

12:54.529 --> 12:57.072
So much for seeing
if the canister's been in use.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.383
Although I guess
I could check its activity

12:59.448 --> 13:02.292
by logging in to Horizon's
mainframe with my tablet.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.022
Yeah. Why not?
I'm sure people multitask

13:05.080 --> 13:07.471
at sports events
all the time, right?

13:10.848 --> 13:12.265
Excuse me.

13:14.018 --> 13:17.471
Do you know if the Wi-Fi password
is still "Ra-ra-sis-boom"...

13:17.570 --> 13:20.331
Whoa! "bah"?

13:20.496 --> 13:22.700
Whoa!

13:22.885 --> 13:26.509
Tiny tutor! Hey, you made it.
Where's your foam finger?

13:26.689 --> 13:30.109
I, uh,
must've left it at home.

13:32.237 --> 13:34.452
Get this crowd cheering,
Mary Jane.

13:34.571 --> 13:37.277
Mary Jane?
That's Mary Jane Watson?

13:37.403 --> 13:39.298
Yeah. She's the school mascot
this year.

13:39.378 --> 13:42.521
Wow. Good for her.
Go get 'em, tiger!

13:46.025 --> 13:48.297
Go, Tigers!

13:48.515 --> 13:50.501
Go, Tigers!

13:51.004 --> 13:53.391
Whoo. I'm beginning
to understand

13:53.449 --> 13:55.150
why you felt
so much pressure, Flash.

13:55.223 --> 13:57.579
- Are you nervous?
- I'm pumped!

13:57.711 --> 13:59.611
Gonna crush those guys!

13:59.838 --> 14:03.005
See? This is the way you show up
that Truman quarterback.

14:03.164 --> 14:05.238
It's about how you play,
not how you fight.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.495
Yeah?
He's not playing tonight.

14:07.621 --> 14:11.069
Doofus claimed he got injured when a
monster attacked him in that café.

14:11.175 --> 14:12.800
Can you believe it? I mean,

14:12.858 --> 14:15.118
I get that he's scared of me,
but a monster?

14:15.232 --> 14:18.787
Please! I gotta go.
See ya after the game?

14:18.845 --> 14:21.171
Sure. And good luck!

14:21.369 --> 14:25.425
If Max is Venom, then why would he
go after a teenager like Wyatt?

14:26.360 --> 14:29.380
Unless Wyatt is one of the people
who signed Salerno's petition.

14:30.449 --> 14:33.136
Nope.
Kevin Wyatt isn't listed.

14:33.663 --> 14:37.197
Think, Pete. Why would Venom
go after a quarterback?

14:37.255 --> 14:39.790
- You're going down!
- Wait a minute.

14:40.068 --> 14:42.068
Keep it up,
and you won't be able to play

14:42.213 --> 14:44.972
'cause your <i> legs</i>
are no good!

14:45.581 --> 14:48.022
Mr. Salerno says if I don't pass
tomorrow's science exam,

14:48.080 --> 14:50.596
I can't play
in the big game this weekend.

14:50.966 --> 14:53.884
Could it be... Flash?

14:54.770 --> 14:59.664
But the only time Flash was ever near
the Symbiote was at... the Stark Expo!

15:02.837 --> 15:04.693
Gotta find footage
of the expo.

15:04.761 --> 15:07.042
I know he helped get it off
me, but could it have...

15:07.136 --> 15:09.501
There's Flash,
and there's the...

15:14.691 --> 15:16.625
Oh, no!

15:21.820 --> 15:23.782
Flash Thompson...

15:25.976 --> 15:27.342
is Venom.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.438
So it was Flash the whole time?

15:31.496 --> 15:33.466
I can't figure this out.

15:33.631 --> 15:35.208
I was so
distracted by the idea

15:35.255 --> 15:36.805
that Venom
had to be someone smart

15:36.863 --> 15:39.678
that I completely
underestimated Flash.

15:40.396 --> 15:42.404
Everyone, stay calm!

15:42.929 --> 15:45.283
Flash, I know you're in there.
Stand down!

15:48.001 --> 15:51.204
What's happening to me?

15:51.600 --> 15:54.115
Flash, it's the creature
from the expo. Aah!

15:54.181 --> 15:57.483
It bonded with you when you pulled
it off me. You have to fight it!

15:57.648 --> 15:59.985
I'm...

16:00.209 --> 16:02.547
trying!

16:06.994 --> 16:08.745
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:08.809 --> 16:10.544
Flag on the play!

16:14.899 --> 16:16.913
Unnecessary roughness.

16:17.197 --> 16:19.580
But I've got a better play.

16:21.501 --> 16:22.604
Huh?

16:22.710 --> 16:24.216
What's going on?

16:24.355 --> 16:25.864
Looks like one can
won't do the trick.

16:25.922 --> 16:27.759
I need more volume.

16:27.948 --> 16:30.242
Let's hear some team spirit!

16:34.416 --> 16:36.000
Hit him full blast!

16:44.344 --> 16:47.127
- Flash, you all right?
- Did I score?

16:47.271 --> 16:49.579
Let's just say I think
you're gonna be the MVP:

16:49.637 --> 16:51.497
Most Venomish Player.

16:51.799 --> 16:53.899
Although the competition
is fierce.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.211
Uh-oh.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.842
Looks like all the air horns
got used up on you.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.236
Run!

17:05.631 --> 17:07.118
We need a plan.

17:08.347 --> 17:10.737
My tutor can help us.
He's super smart.

17:10.915 --> 17:13.987
Yo! Parker!
Where are you?

17:14.186 --> 17:16.759
If he is smart, he got out of
here when Team Venom showed up.

17:16.946 --> 17:19.752
I still need a way to separate
the Symbiote from these guys.

17:19.810 --> 17:23.679
I can rip it off them like I did for you
at the expo. There's too many of them.

17:23.736 --> 17:25.906
Plus we don't want you
touching it again.

17:26.027 --> 17:27.940
We need something
that will force the Symbiote

17:27.998 --> 17:29.956
to separate from the players
on its own.

17:30.068 --> 17:32.210
Like a chemical catalyst.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.642
Oh! What about, uh, uh,
monoammonium phosphate?

17:38.708 --> 17:40.211
It's the stuff
in fire extinguishers

17:40.269 --> 17:42.697
that separates the oxygen
from the fuel.

17:42.856 --> 17:44.822
It was one of
the answers on my test.

17:45.342 --> 17:48.180
Thompson,
you're a genius!

17:48.458 --> 17:52.190
But sadly, all I have are
webs, not fire extinguishers.

17:52.373 --> 17:54.315
Yeah. Not a big help.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.216
But the school
has plenty of 'em.

17:56.295 --> 17:57.649
Then here's the play.

17:57.788 --> 17:59.965
I'll fake a distraction
and occupy the players.

18:00.086 --> 18:01.802
You head up the middle
and into the school,

18:01.860 --> 18:03.801
bringing back as many
extinguishers as you can.

18:03.859 --> 18:06.856
- On it!
- Grass hut! Thatched hut!

18:06.914 --> 18:08.725
Tiki hut! Hike!

18:14.214 --> 18:16.798
Oh! A Midtown win
brings satisfaction,

18:16.856 --> 18:19.035
even if it's a distraction!

18:19.866 --> 18:22.507
Uh-oh. Looks like
a Spider blitz.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.555
Touchdown!

18:31.164 --> 18:33.058
Why so defensive?

18:33.266 --> 18:35.101
Get it? "Defensive"?

18:35.228 --> 18:37.864
'Cause you're all
defensive line... backers.

18:38.096 --> 18:40.319
Don't worry. I only know
a few football terms.

18:40.497 --> 18:42.206
They're almost done.

18:42.684 --> 18:44.441
Yeah, baby!

18:44.606 --> 18:47.472
Flash cuts to the left.
Then to the right.

18:48.181 --> 18:50.048
He's unstoppable!

18:51.887 --> 18:52.919
Ow!

18:53.010 --> 18:56.212
Huh. Guess it's back
to training camp, boys.

19:01.781 --> 19:03.862
Hope Flash makes it back
with those extinguishers.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.598
Or this is gonna
be a brutal halftime show.

19:11.975 --> 19:14.140
Spidey, go long!
"Go long"?

19:14.207 --> 19:16.776
Oh, you mean "run"!
And with a little luck...

19:16.843 --> 19:18.379
Come on, Spidey.
Don't choke!

19:18.437 --> 19:22.576
Lots of people watching!
Catch! Yes!

19:22.836 --> 19:25.476
I know this is not the way fire
extinguishers should ever be used,

19:25.534 --> 19:29.093
but this is a dire emergency and lives
are at stake, so we've got no choice.

19:37.341 --> 19:40.528
That's a first down!
Now we gotta take the rest down.

19:40.595 --> 19:43.476
Flash, spray 'em all.
It won't hurt the players, because...

19:43.575 --> 19:45.885
Because the chemicals
only affect the Symbiote...

19:46.011 --> 19:49.340
Freezing it without ever
touching the players.

19:52.345 --> 19:54.013
Nerd!

19:54.158 --> 19:55.843
Don't lose any of it.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.831
Max?
What are you doing here?

19:59.023 --> 20:02.934
I heard you stayed away
because... of some petition.

20:03.099 --> 20:05.390
Well, I figure if you can't
face your opposition

20:05.463 --> 20:07.758
in a sports arena,
where can you do it?

20:07.893 --> 20:11.797
But right now, we need to contain
the frozen pieces of the V-252,

20:11.855 --> 20:13.790
and my equipment
is back at Horizon.

20:13.903 --> 20:16.470
I think I can lend a hand.
These containers

20:16.528 --> 20:18.739
may not be as advanced
as your Horizon ones,

20:18.852 --> 20:20.819
but they should
hold them for now.

20:20.946 --> 20:23.116
Thank you, Sal.
If Midtown's equipment

20:23.242 --> 20:26.243
is anything like its teachers,
I'm sure it's top notch.

20:26.384 --> 20:29.723
And I'm sorry if I've come
across as inconsiderate.

20:29.870 --> 20:31.849
Maybe moving forward,
I could recruit

20:31.914 --> 20:34.557
students based on <i> your</i>
recommendations.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.413
I'd like that, Max.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.071
Thank you.

20:38.340 --> 20:41.861
Hey! I just got a text
from Tony Stark.

20:42.361 --> 20:44.228
"Sorry I didn't get back
to you sooner.

20:44.448 --> 20:46.020
"I was in space.

20:46.217 --> 20:50.185
"What. A. World. Huh.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.271
- Call me back."
- No need to, Mr. Stark.

20:53.338 --> 20:56.610
Flash and Spidey
were on the case.

21:00.146 --> 21:01.180
Hmm?

21:01.247 --> 21:03.793
Well, if it isn't
Puny Parker.

21:03.857 --> 21:06.595
Come on, guys. I'm just returning
Mr. Salerno's equipment.

21:06.653 --> 21:08.843
Hey! No one messes
with Parker.

21:08.901 --> 21:12.678
If it wasn't for him, I couldn't have
saved Spider-Man's neck... again!

21:13.500 --> 21:15.368
Whatever you say, Flash.

21:16.823 --> 21:19.101
Don't worry about them
anymore, tiny tutor.

21:19.161 --> 21:23.301
From now on, you and I are gonna
be like two peas in a paramecium.

21:23.599 --> 21:25.104
I mean, um...

21:25.171 --> 21:27.554
Flash, you're my hero.

21:27.623 --> 21:28.922
Noogie!

21:28.980 --> 21:30.893
Ow!
