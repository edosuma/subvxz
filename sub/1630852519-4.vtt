WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:06.484
- When you chose this,
you didn't choose me.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.138
- I know we've had
our differences.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.227
- Why don't you just tell me
why you spoke to my boss.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.489
- I have stomach cancer.

00:12.273 --> 00:15.798
- I was thinking you could move
in here, with me and Amira.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.542
[alarm clock ringing]

00:23.762 --> 00:26.113
[gentle music]

00:35.774 --> 00:37.428
[indistinct]

00:43.086 --> 00:45.219
[rhythmic music playing]

00:47.830 --> 00:49.571
[giggling]

00:51.051 --> 00:54.532
- No, you have to bend
your knees.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.361
Not that much!
[indistinct chatter]

00:57.405 --> 00:59.668
Your arms have to be looser.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.672
[laughing]

01:05.674 --> 01:09.591
- Living in sin with me and
praying in the morning, Bashir?

01:09.634 --> 01:13.203
- We could fix that.
Call the Imam, get married.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.423
You and Amira can do your dance
at the party.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.600
- That may be my least romantic
proposal since,

01:18.643 --> 01:19.818
uh, your first one.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.559
- I got a yes then, didn't I?

01:21.603 --> 01:22.865
[chuckling]

01:23.953 --> 01:25.259
What will you do today?

01:25.302 --> 01:27.696
- Amira's lending me her
tech skills.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.219
[in Arabic]:

01:37.271 --> 01:40.187
- I don't mind paying the bills
while you study English

01:40.230 --> 01:41.927
and figure out
your qualifications.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.452
- I know that.
But I want to work.

01:45.148 --> 01:48.412
And maybe we'll organize
her room.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.415
Put away some of the mess
she moved in here with.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.939
- Yeah, she keeps anything
with a story.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.247
After everything over
these years,

01:57.291 --> 01:59.902
I'm going to work on
a Saturday,

01:59.945 --> 02:02.905
and I'm not worried
about leaving her home alone.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.170
[city hubbub]

02:07.214 --> 02:09.216
[knocking]

02:18.790 --> 02:20.531
[gentle music]

02:22.490 --> 02:24.144
- Didn't hear you get up.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.842
- Oh, I thought a walk would
do me good.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.150
- Excited to reclaim
your office?

02:30.193 --> 02:32.326
- That's up to the committee.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.418
- Are you nervous?

02:37.461 --> 02:39.246
- I'll update them on
how I am doing,

02:39.289 --> 02:43.032
and they'll either agree
that I'm ready to come back
to work or...

02:43.075 --> 02:46.775
they won't.
- When you say update?

02:46.818 --> 02:48.690
- The truth, Claire.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.824
- And what are you gonna say if
they ask about what Novak said

02:52.868 --> 02:54.130
during the M and M rounds?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.001
- That I instill a culture
of fear?

02:56.045 --> 03:00.180
I'll tell them that Dr. Novak
had the unfortunate luck

03:00.223 --> 03:02.530
of working under me when I was
less charming.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.706
Had worse when I was
a resident,

03:04.749 --> 03:06.577
though I never remember
publicly flogging

03:06.621 --> 03:08.188
any of my bosses for it.
Is that okay?

03:08.231 --> 03:09.363
- Yeah.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.714
And on the subject of
you ignoring your symptoms

03:12.757 --> 03:14.542
that led to your stroke?

03:14.585 --> 03:18.067
- Well, let's hope 30 years here
buy some clemency.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.243
- Are you sure you want this
again Jed?

03:22.071 --> 03:24.247
- I should go up there.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.388
[gentle music]

03:47.879 --> 03:49.141
- Mr. Neal?
- Hey.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.534
- Hi, I'm Dr. Leblanc.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.623
I heard you had a bit
of fall today.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.582
Do you mind if I take a look?
- Yeah.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.583
- Okay.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.151
Yeah, this'll need sutures.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.675
Can you tell me where else
it hurts?

04:00.718 --> 04:02.851
- Uh, well, my stomach got
the worst of it.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.200
- Yeah.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.289
Okay, lie down for me please?

04:08.378 --> 04:10.511
Here we go, let's see here.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.644
[inhales sharply]

04:13.688 --> 04:16.255
Hmm.
Where did you fall exactly?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.083
- Hum. I didn't fall.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.694
The truth is,

04:19.737 --> 04:21.652
yeah, I borrowed money
from the wrong guy

04:21.696 --> 04:24.307
and I lost it in a card game.
He didn't take it so well.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.614
- Okay, so you're saying that
he beat you up?

04:26.657 --> 04:28.920
- Sometimes you eat the bear,
sometimes the bear eats you?

04:28.964 --> 04:31.532
- No, but we can call the police
if you want to file a report.

04:31.575 --> 04:34.578
- Thanks. I think I'm just gonna
call this a lesson learned

04:34.622 --> 04:37.059
and move on.
- Okay.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.584
Did you lose consciousness or
feel dizzy at all?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.717
- No.
- Any nausea? Vomiting?

04:42.760 --> 04:45.285
Trouble with your eyesight?
- No. I mean, not from this.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.070
- What do you mean?
- Well, I get double vision
sometimes,

04:48.113 --> 04:51.247
but you know, the larger problem
is I don't know how to fight.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.902
- I'm gonna do an ultrasound
on your abdomen.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.384
Okay.
This might be cool.

05:00.996 --> 05:05.130
- I bet your boyfriend
wouldn't get his ass handed
to him like this.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.567
[chuckles]

05:07.263 --> 05:08.960
Unless you're single.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.963
Which I will be,

05:12.007 --> 05:14.183
when my wife finds out
how much money I lost.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.185
[awkward chuckle]

05:16.228 --> 05:18.013
- There's fluid around
your spleen.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.756
- Uh... Is that a bad thing?
- No, not necessarily,

05:21.799 --> 05:24.280
but we need to make sure
there's no organ damage.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.977
So we'll do imaging to be sure.

05:26.021 --> 05:29.111
I'll be back soon to stitch
the cut on your cheek.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.243
- Thank you.
- 'Course.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.897
- Theo.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.986
I keep forgetting to give
these back.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.858
- Well, you may have moved on,
but your things haven't.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.903
Can you come by this week and
get the rest of it?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.992
- Well, I called the junk
service. They were supposed--

05:41.036 --> 05:42.385
- Well, they didn't.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.126
You've been gone two weeks,

05:44.169 --> 05:45.693
your things are mixed in
with mine

05:45.736 --> 05:48.522
and there's the Sudbury stuff
and it's just...

05:49.218 --> 05:50.959
- Theo, I'm--
- Forget it.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.049
I'll deal with it.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.621
- Sending Mr. Neal to CT,

06:00.664 --> 06:02.187
flagging a potential
low-grade splenic injury.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.494
He just admitted to being
in a fight so I want to keep him

06:04.538 --> 06:05.843
until we get the full picture.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.497
- Couple hours monitoring
will do, Leblanc.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.934
Don't follow the poor guy home
and cook him soup.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.371
Multiple traumas incoming.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.677
EMS reports a boy with
hypothermia

06:13.721 --> 06:15.940
and a woman sliced by
a boat propeller

06:15.984 --> 06:18.334
losing blood volume,
both pulled from Lake Ontario.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.728
Dr. Hamed,
we'll take the mom.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.995
[dramatic music]

06:28.344 --> 06:29.911
- Let me go!

06:30.694 --> 06:32.566
- Witnesses say they turned
too sharp and capsized.

06:32.609 --> 06:36.004
His core temp's down to 30.
Rate's 65, BP's 95 on 53.

06:36.047 --> 06:38.528
Resp rate's 13, and no telling
how much water he took in.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.488
- It's okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa--

06:41.531 --> 06:43.707
- Okay, on three.
One, two, three.

06:43.751 --> 06:44.839
- Don't!

06:44.882 --> 06:47.102
- Everything's gonna be okay,
Owen.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.712
Arnold, heating blankets.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.976
- No! Stop!

06:52.020 --> 06:54.109
- Okay, we need a line
and warmed oxygen. Warmed
IV fluids too.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.327
- No!

06:55.371 --> 06:56.938
[whimpering]

06:56.981 --> 06:58.243
- Okay.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.115
[heavy breathing]

07:00.158 --> 07:02.334
- My husband,
did he make it?

07:02.378 --> 07:04.511
- We're looking for him,
ma'am.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.773
- Two large-bore IVs,

07:05.816 --> 07:07.252
cross-match and
give two units O-neg.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.906
Get her on a monitor!

07:08.950 --> 07:11.996
- Somebody, please...

07:12.040 --> 07:13.520
My son.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.436
- He's here. He has hypothermia,
he's being warmed.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.569
- He has SPD.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.442
- What's SPD?
- Sensory Processing Disorder.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.965
It's a kind of neurodivergence.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.577
[laboured breathing]: Sounds,
lights, touch.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.274
They all set him off.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.625
- Rhoda, make sure Dr. Hunter
knows.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.932
- It's really important we get
you warmed up. Okay, pal?

07:34.976 --> 07:37.631
- Warmed O2's ready.
- No, Owen, I need you
to stay down.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.415
- Don't touch me!
- Resp rate's falling.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.590
Ketamine?

07:40.634 --> 07:42.462
- Dr. Hunter.

07:44.942 --> 07:48.206
- Okay, okay, we're not
touching you, okay?

07:48.250 --> 07:49.991
- GCS is seven.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.776
Radial and ulnar pulses
are absent.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.648
- Brachial artery is severed.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.695
- Okay, buddy, we know
about your condition
and we're here to help.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.610
Owen, your temperature's
too low,

08:00.654 --> 08:02.133
we need to bring it back up,
okay?

08:02.177 --> 08:04.135
I know you don't like
the feeling of the blanket,

08:04.179 --> 08:05.789
but even a few minutes
will really help us.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.878
- I've never seen SPD before.
Is it the warming blankets?

08:07.922 --> 08:10.359
- It's everything.
- What do you want to do?

08:10.402 --> 08:12.622
[sighs]
- We don't have a choice.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.059
We're gonna hold you down for
just a second. Okay, Owen?

08:15.103 --> 08:16.887
We're going to give you some
medicine with a needle

08:16.931 --> 08:19.194
to make you sleepy.
- No! Not nee-- no, no, no!

08:19.237 --> 08:20.848
[screaming]

08:20.891 --> 08:22.980
No, no, no!

08:23.024 --> 08:25.505
[indistinct chatter]

08:25.548 --> 08:27.158
[screaming]

08:27.202 --> 08:29.247
- It's done buddy, it's done,
it's done.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.727
- It's okay.
[indistinct]

08:30.771 --> 08:32.686
It's okay, it's okay.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.822
- OR's on standby, guys.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.345
- She might not survive
the trip up.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.390
What's the call
here, Dr. Hamed?

08:41.433 --> 08:42.870
- Protocol would be transfusions

08:42.913 --> 08:44.349
to stabilize her blood
pressure.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.873
- And if that's not her
best shot?

08:45.916 --> 08:48.397
Since when do you let protocol
stand in your way?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.790
We fix the bleed here.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.574
Brachial plexus block
for anesthesia.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.445
1 % xylocaine, 10 cc syringe,

08:53.489 --> 08:56.013
18 and 25 gauge needle
with a catheter.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.275
Let's go.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.368
Now if I had made this call
when I was a resident,

09:03.412 --> 09:04.544
I would've been called
dangerous.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.458
- And if you'd made
the other call?

09:06.502 --> 09:08.373
Waiting and risking her life?

09:08.417 --> 09:09.940
- Short-sighted
and irresponsible.

09:09.984 --> 09:10.941
- BP's 85.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.595
- Still no word on her husband?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.208
- Sorry about the wait.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.820
I'll do your sutures now.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.386
- Lot of action out there?

09:21.430 --> 09:23.301
- Uh, it's just a normal
Saturday for us.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.042
- At least you're never bored.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.610
- So imaging does show
a rupture to your spleen.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.046
But it's minor, a grade one,

09:29.090 --> 09:30.744
which means it'll heal
by itself.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.746
I can also refer you
to an ophthalmologist.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.226
Occasional double vision
is normally related to dryness,

09:35.270 --> 09:37.751
but it wouldn't hurt to see
a specialist.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.101
- I'm seeing fine now.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.148
[nervous laughter]

09:44.192 --> 09:45.585
- Excuse me.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.325
- Oh.
- Look straight.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.596
This won't take long.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.598
- You smell good.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.560
- Mr. Neal.
- What?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.301
Come on...

10:06.823 --> 10:08.085
[gasps]
- Stop!

10:08.129 --> 10:09.304
- Come on.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.871
You've been flirting
with me all morning.

10:10.914 --> 10:11.828
[grunts]

10:13.003 --> 10:15.005
[cries out]

10:15.049 --> 10:16.485
[clattering]

10:16.528 --> 10:18.139
You bitch!

10:18.835 --> 10:21.011
[panting]
- Hey, whoa!

10:21.055 --> 10:22.796
[cries out]

10:22.839 --> 10:24.493
- Get off me, man!
I didn't do anything!

10:24.536 --> 10:26.582
- Calm down.
- Come on! Ow!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.366
[panting]
- Mags?

10:28.410 --> 10:29.716
- Calm down!

10:29.759 --> 10:32.022
- Come with me.
It's okay.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.765
[grunting, yelling]
- It's over.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.638
- Hey. You okay?

10:38.681 --> 10:40.857
[panting]

10:46.341 --> 10:48.212
- Is this the father from
the boat?

10:48.256 --> 10:49.779
- It took them longer
to find him.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.520
They had to resuscitate.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.220
No pain response.

10:56.264 --> 10:59.093
- O2 sats are down to 90.
Let's get him on a 100 % oxygen.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.790
Do we have a GCS?

11:01.312 --> 11:04.054
- Three.
And no pupillary reflex.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.796
He's showing every sign
of brain death.

11:07.841 --> 11:11.453
I'll confirm with EEG and,
uh, tell the mom.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.673
- I'll go see the kid.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.331
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

11:20.375 --> 11:21.898
- Well, he made
a couple comments,

11:21.942 --> 11:23.378
but I didn't think
too much of it.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.988
- What happened next, Mags?

11:25.032 --> 11:26.947
- Well, then he grabbed me,
you know,

11:26.990 --> 11:29.819
and I pushed him to try
to get loose.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.821
- Good.
Good for you.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.781
- And then that's when he got
angry, and he shoved me,

11:34.824 --> 11:37.522
and then Lou came in and tried
to grab him before he could,

11:37.566 --> 11:40.221
you know....
- I just heard. Mags?

11:40.264 --> 11:42.658
- I'm fine. Are you back?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.181
- So it would seem.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.489
The police are here.
- I'll go talk to them.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.926
- Dr. Atwater can handle it.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.493
Find Mags when they need
a statement.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.060
- I'll take over her patient
as well.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.409
- Thanks, Wendy.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.324
Let's keep things as they are
for this morning,

11:56.367 --> 11:57.891
while I get my bearings.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.545
We'll talk later about how
my transition back will work.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.333
- Sir.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.248
- Hold on a minute, doctor.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.599
- What?
- Do you need to take the day?

12:10.642 --> 12:13.558
- No. No, I'd just really want
to keep moving.

12:13.602 --> 12:17.084
I'm gonna tell Dr. Atwater that
his splenic rupture makes sense,

12:17.127 --> 12:18.476
but he also complained
of double vision,

12:18.520 --> 12:21.044
and I offered him a referral,
but he...

12:21.088 --> 12:22.872
he wasn't interested, so.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.961
- I've missed our differentials.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.833
- Me too.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.836
- How have you been,
this last month?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.402
- Hum...

12:32.273 --> 12:35.015
Dr. Novak has his own way
of doing things, I guess,

12:35.058 --> 12:37.408
and I was just getting
used to it.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.282
- I'm sorry this happened
to you. It shouldn't have.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.981
- I'm really happy you're back.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.855
[indistinct chatter]

12:53.598 --> 12:55.644
- They told me you were up,
Olivia.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.428
And uh, the pain meds
aren't helping?

12:57.994 --> 13:01.737
I can put in a catheter to get
you on a continuous infusion

13:01.781 --> 13:02.999
of a local anesthetic.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.393
- Owen. How is he?

13:05.436 --> 13:07.308
- His temperature's rising.

13:07.830 --> 13:11.747
We had to sedate him,
but his doctors are aware
of his condition.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.270
[sighs]

13:14.228 --> 13:15.751
- And Eli?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.798
A nurse said he's here,
but won't say how he is.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.930
- Your husband, um...

13:21.931 --> 13:23.628
He...

13:23.672 --> 13:27.284
he was pulled out of
the lake and resuscitated.

13:28.633 --> 13:31.245
But he went without oxygen
for too long

13:31.288 --> 13:33.638
and his brain is no longer
functioning.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.727
- What?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.166
No. That can't be.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.647
- He's on mechanical ventilator
and it's...

13:42.691 --> 13:45.302
it's the only thing
keeping him alive.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.479
- What?
- Olivia.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.530
Eli is not going to recover.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.576
- Oh God...

13:58.620 --> 13:59.926
No.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.623
- If there's anything we can do.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.495
- Well, you can save him.
Please.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.977
[sobbing]
Oh God.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.328
- I'm very sorry.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.857
[soft music]

14:28.215 --> 14:30.870
- You've been pretty brave
today, pal.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.835
I know we didn't get off
to a great start.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.578
I'm sorry about the needle.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.712
I also know you don't like
the way the blankets feel.

14:53.370 --> 14:57.505
Your body isn't warming up
on its own,

14:57.548 --> 15:00.987
so I need you to speak up
if there's anything we're doing

15:01.030 --> 15:03.380
that makes you feel bad,

15:03.424 --> 15:06.079
or anything we can do to make
things easier.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.607
Good news is you get to see
your mom soon.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.395
- I want to see my dad.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.842
- I'm fine. Guys.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.151
Okay, I'm okay.

15:35.195 --> 15:39.503
- Okay, so uh, the trops
from the patient in four
came back negative.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.028
It's just a stable angina
so I can discharge with--

15:42.071 --> 15:43.681
- No, no, I'll take it.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.945
Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.599
Dr. Bishop, hi.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.082
- It's good to have you back,
sir.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.433
- Alright, enough gawking.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.957
Everybody back to work.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.570
- When did you decide to--
- The intensivist wants to know

16:02.613 --> 16:05.355
if Eli Rosenthal's family has
made a decision yet.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.835
- Not yet.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.099
I should check on his wife.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.800
- Sir.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.029
Ibuprofen?

16:27.899 --> 16:28.988
Thank you.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.904
- His wife's arrived.
- Hmm.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.126
I knew he was a creep.
I knew it.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.476
Just didn't follow my instincts,
you know, completely--

16:39.520 --> 16:42.610
- Mags. You didn't cause this.
He did.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.700
He made a decision
and put you in a situation.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.616
- And now I have to live
with it.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.578
- How's she doing?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.928
- Somewhere between
didn't happen

16:56.972 --> 16:59.018
and can't stop thinking
about it.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.150
[sighing]

17:01.194 --> 17:03.152
- Mr. Eldridge?

17:03.196 --> 17:04.806
Can I have a look?
- Sure.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.330
[groans]

17:08.723 --> 17:11.638
[exhales sharply]
Hernia.

17:12.378 --> 17:14.816
It was barely a bump
two months ago.

17:14.858 --> 17:17.471
My GP offered to refer
a surgeon,

17:17.513 --> 17:20.256
but I said let's wait
and see.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.566
- Look, if you're worried about
the surgery, don't be, okay?

17:25.608 --> 17:26.784
We can do it laparoscopically,

17:26.828 --> 17:28.612
so it's through small
incisions.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.484
You'll be out of here by today
or tomorrow.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.747
- And uh, if it's not laparo?

17:32.790 --> 17:35.489
- Sir, if you can avoid the pain
of open surgery.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.230
- I can take the pain.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.101
- Oh. Well...

17:39.145 --> 17:42.235
- And, you can call my sister,
tell her I need the support?

17:42.278 --> 17:45.194
She'll take it more seriously
if it comes from you.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.331
- I explained all the benefits
of laparo to Mr. Eldridge,

17:51.374 --> 17:53.072
and he still wants open surgery.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.117
First, I was thinking
drug seeker.

17:55.161 --> 17:58.686
- Oh. Even pain seeker.
I've seen those before too.

17:58.729 --> 18:02.037
You said he didn't let his GP
address the issue early on.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.518
- Yeah. I think he just wants
to milk this experience

18:04.561 --> 18:06.085
for all it's worth.
- Hmm.

18:07.608 --> 18:11.829
- So your last follow-up
with my father.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.918
- You know I can't discuss
an on-going patient.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.835
- Yeah, he's just not great
at relaying important details.

18:17.879 --> 18:21.187
- He seems like a guy trying his
best to stay in good spirits.

18:22.449 --> 18:26.105
Hmm. We can get Mr. Eldridge
in today,

18:26.148 --> 18:28.150
but you need to document
everything.

18:28.194 --> 18:31.371
Get it in writing that
he chose open surgery AMA.

18:31.414 --> 18:35.070
- Yeah, I think I just need one
more shot to change his mind.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.378
- Dr. Curtis, if he's got a
legitimate fear of laparoscopy--

18:38.421 --> 18:39.727
- He doesn't.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.685
- Better be sure.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.604
- Eli... The ventilator.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.216
We can't leave him on it.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.783
- No one's rushing you to make
that decision.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.046
- But Owen,

18:55.090 --> 18:56.396
he doesn't know.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.180
- Not until you want him to.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.966
- We moved to Ward's Island
for him.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.622
It's so quiet there.

19:07.494 --> 19:10.149
Eli quit his job just
to homeschool.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.977
I wasn't patient enough
with him.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.591
Could you be with me
when Owen hears?

19:17.634 --> 19:19.158
- Of course.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.991
- Does your brother mind
when you bother him at work?

19:27.035 --> 19:29.820
- He says he'd say, "References
available on request

19:29.864 --> 19:32.954
and hope they forgot they needed
them once they met me."

19:32.997 --> 19:34.651
[in Arabic]:

19:40.266 --> 19:41.745
- It beats homework.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.748
- Let's do something fun after.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.707
We could paint your room?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.666
We just have to tidy a bit
first.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.408
Maybe unpack some boxes.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.455
- Hum, recent work experience.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.109
Did you say you worked in
your cousin's cafe in Amman?

19:58.153 --> 19:59.328
- Hmm-mm.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.331
We can make your room your own?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.465
Any colour you want.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.206
- I don't want to.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.211
- Right here, Owen.

20:15.866 --> 20:19.348
- Oh honey, I'm so glad
you're okay.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.655
- Where's Dad?

20:21.698 --> 20:24.397
Why won't they tell me?
- Owen...

20:24.875 --> 20:28.052
I need you to prepare yourself
for some hard news.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.359
Come here.

20:32.013 --> 20:35.408
Um, when the boat went over,

20:35.451 --> 20:37.801
Dad was under for
a long time.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.587
The doctors examined him,
and...

20:41.240 --> 20:43.938
They found out that his brain
isn't working anymore.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.940
- Then they need to fix it.

20:47.202 --> 20:51.467
- Sometimes when a person's
brain is injured badly,

20:52.381 --> 20:54.122
we can't.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.864
- Right now
we're using a machine

20:56.907 --> 20:58.692
to help his body breathe.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.520
- Then he's not dead.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.044
- I'm so sorry, baby.
He is.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.046
I didn't want
to believe it either.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.222
- They said he was breathing.
He's alive if he's breathing.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
- But he won't be able to
without the machine.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.531
Once we turn it off.
- Then don't!

21:11.574 --> 21:13.054
- Owen, they have to.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.926
Dad would want us to.
- You don't know that!

21:15.970 --> 21:18.364
You let them hurt me, now
you're letting them kill Dad?

21:18.407 --> 21:20.322
- I know this is a lot.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.064
You can take some time to get
used to what we're telling you.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.240
- No!
You don't know us!

21:25.284 --> 21:28.243
Don't let them do this.
He could wake up.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.766
He could!
- No.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.333
He's gone, baby.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.901
- You're wrong! I hate you!
- You don't mean that.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.077
You never do.
- I always do!

21:36.120 --> 21:38.732
This is your fault!
You do what you want.

21:38.775 --> 21:41.648
You don't care what I want
or what Dad wants,

21:41.691 --> 21:43.954
and you don't get
to kill him!

21:43.998 --> 21:45.434
- You think I wanted this?

21:45.913 --> 21:47.915
You got upset on that boat.

21:47.958 --> 21:50.570
You couldn't calm down and
Dad lost control.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.441
That's why this happened!

21:55.139 --> 21:56.619
Owen, I--

21:56.663 --> 21:58.795
[sobbing]

22:09.589 --> 22:14.028
The committee agreed
I'd resume my duties
effective immediately,

22:14.071 --> 22:17.901
but that I won't be working
hands-on with patients

22:17.945 --> 22:19.816
for the foreseeable
future.

22:19.860 --> 22:23.037
I'll still be teaching,
and running the department.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.607
This will put added
responsibility onto you, Wendy.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.783
- Hum...

22:30.958 --> 22:33.743
what about, hum,
Dr. Novak?

22:34.570 --> 22:37.443
- I'm taking today to
consider that.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.054
Thank you both.

22:48.062 --> 22:50.151
- I know that wasn't easy.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.327
- Nothing else to say, Claire.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.548
My cognitive tests are clear,

22:55.591 --> 22:58.638
but my fine motor skills
are lacking.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.773
- Hello?

23:03.817 --> 23:05.122
[in Arabic]:

23:05.166 --> 23:06.820
- Is everything okay?

23:07.298 --> 23:09.126
- It's about Amira.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.346
I just thought
you should know.

23:12.347 --> 23:13.653
[in Arabic]:

23:20.877 --> 23:24.098
- She's moved around so much
since leaving our parents.

23:24.141 --> 23:27.449
I don't think she can trust
anything as permanent.

23:28.363 --> 23:31.801
You know, it's not just
the apartment this time.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.151
It's also us.

23:34.195 --> 23:36.284
It's you and me.

23:36.327 --> 23:40.506
- She needs us to be real.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.682
- Does that scare you?

23:43.378 --> 23:45.511
- What scares me is...

23:46.381 --> 23:49.428
...is not knowing what you
really feel.

23:50.385 --> 23:54.476
Can you trust anything
as permanent?

23:56.173 --> 23:59.220
- I... I know I'm happy.

23:59.263 --> 24:00.656
- I am too.

24:00.700 --> 24:05.052
But are you happy because of
what it means for her?

24:05.574 --> 24:08.969
Or because of what it means
for us?

24:10.927 --> 24:12.494
- Um...

24:12.538 --> 24:16.542
I'll talk to you later
tonight.

24:18.282 --> 24:19.632
Bye.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.770
Olivia?

24:28.467 --> 24:31.121
- I could never soothe him
when he was a baby.

24:34.864 --> 24:38.172
Then he got older, and
diagnosed.

24:39.565 --> 24:45.440
But Eli, he knows how.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.096
They have this language
together.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.061
- Arnold?

24:58.105 --> 24:59.541
- Yeah.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.587
- Let's get you back to
your room.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.295
- Where's the bathroom?

25:14.338 --> 25:16.297
- Down the hall to the right.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.733
- Okay, thanks.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.953
- Are you okay?
[sighs]

25:20.780 --> 25:23.391
- My husband.
They say he, uh...

25:23.434 --> 25:25.915
And then there was something
about his spleen, I don't know.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.569
- His spleen has a low-grade
rupture.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.920
With proper rest and
medication, it'll be fine.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.271
- You were the doctor?

25:34.315 --> 25:36.143
The one he...

25:37.013 --> 25:38.754
I'm so sorry.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.975
He wasn't always like this.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.455
A few months ago he started
to change,

25:44.499 --> 25:46.545
and when I'd confront him
about it,

25:46.588 --> 25:48.895
he'd blame it on me,
not come home.

25:50.244 --> 25:53.029
I'm sorry,
this isn't my place.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.293
- Uh, your husband.

25:56.337 --> 26:01.037
Any recent headaches or
changes in taste or smell?

26:01.081 --> 26:02.648
- Why?

26:02.691 --> 26:05.520
Are you saying there's something
medically wrong with him?

26:07.522 --> 26:09.089
- If you'll excuse me.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.965
- What happened?
- As soon as we got her
into bed,

26:16.009 --> 26:19.099
her heart rate went up, her BP
dropped, she got confused.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.363
- Olivia, do you remember
hitting your head?

26:23.103 --> 26:25.627
Could you have lost
consciousness before? Olivia?

26:25.671 --> 26:27.368
- I gave her a drink of water,
she barely sipped it,

26:27.411 --> 26:29.457
she said it felt funny.
And then the vomiting started.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.415
- Felt funny, those were
her words?

26:31.459 --> 26:32.808
- Yeah.
- She's seizing.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.680
Push 60 milligram propofol!

26:37.030 --> 26:38.597
- Thank you.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.558
- Propofol's in!
- Good.

26:47.431 --> 26:48.519
- Talk to me.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.173
- Dr. Bishop.
She was seizing.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.480
And we need to intubate her,
but it could be tricky.

26:52.523 --> 26:53.829
- You need to paralyze her.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.570
Page RT and get the first
physician you can see.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.528
Norm, prep 50 milligrams
rocuronium.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.879
You know I can only walk you
through this?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.011
- What happened?

27:02.055 --> 27:05.841
- Uh, she was light-headed,
and then vomiting

27:05.885 --> 27:08.235
and confusion with tachycardia
and hypotension.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.410
Followed by seizure.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.847
- Subdural hematoma from
head injury?

27:12.805 --> 27:14.633
- Stabilizing larynx.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.899
We're in.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.727
- Well, let's get her up
to imaging.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.425
- Looks more like local
anesthetic systemic toxicity

27:24.468 --> 27:25.513
than a cranial bleed.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.689
- Last?
That's highly unlikely.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.300
- She has no physical indication
of a head injury.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.999
- Dr. Hamed?
She's your patient.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.131
- The catheter may have eroded
a blood vessel,

27:35.175 --> 27:37.220
but statistically a hematoma's
more probable.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.919
- And we prioritize according
to probability.

27:39.962 --> 27:43.749
Imaging first, then talk to me
about toxicity.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.840
- You agree with him?
- He was pretty clear.

27:47.883 --> 27:50.799
- I'm asking what you think
is most likely, given the facts.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.236
- She told Claire taking a sip
felt a bit funny.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.762
Mouth numbness is a common
symptom of last.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.590
- And her heart rate's
increasing.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.897
I'm stopping administering
painkiller.

28:01.941 --> 28:05.031
I'm calling up to toxicology for
a bag of lipid emulsion.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.685
Imaging can wait.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.953
- When did you notice
he was gone?

28:13.996 --> 28:16.216
- Right when I paged you. He was
there but ten minutes ago.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.697
We've all been--
- That's not good enough!

28:21.221 --> 28:22.744
That was uncalled for.

28:22.788 --> 28:26.400
I just... I can't get through
to this kid.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.098
Page security.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.448
Make sure they don't touch him.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.276
[sighing]

28:35.409 --> 28:37.280
- Your OR slot is coming up

28:37.324 --> 28:39.848
and I just want to make sure
that you understand.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.632
- What did Brenda say?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.853
She's not coming?

28:44.897 --> 28:47.595
- The social worker called
your sister and left a message

28:47.638 --> 28:49.336
and she has not gotten
back to us.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.512
- I want you to call her
this time.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.993
Tell her all the stuff you
told me about pain,

28:54.036 --> 28:56.299
and not lifting what's heavy.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.650
- Okay. Huh, look.

28:59.694 --> 29:03.219
The recurrence rate for
open surgery is really high.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.482
Which means that you could
end up right back here.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.790
I just wanna make sure
that you're making this decision

29:08.834 --> 29:10.661
for the right reason.

29:11.097 --> 29:13.186
- My reasons are not
your problem.

29:13.926 --> 29:16.319
Relax, I can handle this.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.628
Now, when you call Brenda, don't
tell her about the lapro option.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.673
Let her think this is
all there is.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.588
- Yeah, uh...

29:27.200 --> 29:28.679
If you want to lie
to your sister,

29:28.723 --> 29:30.856
that's something you're gonna
have to do yourself.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.645
- Mr. Neal.

29:37.688 --> 29:38.864
- Hi.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.866
- Your head CT shows
a tumour.

29:40.909 --> 29:44.086
A sub-frontal meningioma
and they're typically benign.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.175
The tumour's in the lining
of your brain

29:46.219 --> 29:48.438
and relatively easy to remove.
- Hold on--

29:48.482 --> 29:50.049
- Side effects can include
vision problems,

29:50.092 --> 29:52.225
neuro-dysfunction
and personality changes.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.488
Heightened aggression,
impulse control, etcetera.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.577
I'll update Dr. Atwater
and someone from neurosurgery

29:56.620 --> 29:58.057
will be down to answer
any questions.

29:58.100 --> 30:01.147
- Wait. Wait. Wait!

30:01.190 --> 30:03.192
- Dr. Leblanc.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.281
Please!

30:06.152 --> 30:08.328
Are you saying Shane's
personality changes

30:08.371 --> 30:10.025
are because of a tumour?

30:10.069 --> 30:12.027
- I didn't know him before
today, so...

30:12.506 --> 30:16.640
- And if they remove it,
does he go back to normal?

30:17.816 --> 30:21.863
- Many patients do revert
to their previous traits
post surgery, yes.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.519
- All these months.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.564
He made me feel like it was
my fault.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.350
That I did something
to make him stop caring.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.962
- The surgeon will be down soon.

30:34.006 --> 30:35.703
[panting]

30:38.793 --> 30:41.840
- It was definitely systemic
toxicity from the infusion.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.145
Lipid emulsion worked.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.582
BP's stable, rate's stable.

30:46.757 --> 30:49.978
- Does her injured arm look
more pale than her left one now?

30:51.371 --> 30:53.329
- When she got here we fixed
the artery,

30:53.373 --> 30:55.723
and we ran every test
in the book.

30:55.766 --> 30:56.898
She was clear.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.378
- It's cool to the touch.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.859
Earlier she was complaining
about pain.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.686
- Plenty of patients do.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.732
- But we wouldn't know if
the level of her pain

31:04.775 --> 31:07.778
was increasing in severity.
Because the local anesthetic--

31:07.822 --> 31:11.565
- Was masking the post-surgical
compartment syndrome
she was developing?

31:12.305 --> 31:14.437
We've barely got the toxicity
under control,

31:14.481 --> 31:16.352
the last thing this patient
needs is another complication.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.528
- Well, she may have one.
Soft tissue feels wooden.

31:18.572 --> 31:21.270
- I'll get her pressure checked,
just to confirm.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.631
Injecting saline.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.375
40 millimeters of mercury.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.769
If we don't relieve the pressure
under her skin,

31:41.812 --> 31:42.813
she'll lose her arm.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.990
Find bodies, now.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.302
- What's going on here?

31:53.346 --> 31:55.261
- Preparing for an emergent
fasciotomy.

31:55.304 --> 31:56.566
Marking incisions.

31:56.610 --> 31:57.959
- I told you to image her head.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.962
- It wasn't a brain bleed
before, it was toxicity,

32:01.006 --> 32:02.703
the lipid emulsion proved it.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.923
- Could have gone either way.
- But I was right then.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.490
And I am right now.
It's compartment syndrome.

32:07.534 --> 32:08.927
- It just presented.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.494
- Her arm feels wooden,
high compression pressure,

32:11.538 --> 32:13.148
it all points to the same thing.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.715
- Then we need to resolve it.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.979
Claire, doctors Atwater
and Leblanc need help going up.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.067
- Is that it?

32:19.111 --> 32:20.721
- You'd rather I do what,
exactly?

32:20.764 --> 32:23.463
- I would like you to tell me
that I am right for once.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.813
- I agree with your diagnosis,
Dr. Novak.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.336
Now let's get it done.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.643
Dr. Hamed, ready to incise.

32:29.686 --> 32:32.776
- Claire, would you administer
the fentanyl, please.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.127
- Mags, retractors
when you're ready.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.693
- Fentanyl in.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.652
- Excuse me.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.396
- Making incision.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.009
- Retracting.
- Dr. Novak?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.445
Fascia's yours.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.190
- Fascia is exposed.
Cutting.

32:55.234 --> 32:58.106
- Current literature
says we need to open the skin
a few more inches

32:58.150 --> 32:59.673
to inspect the carpal tunnel.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.980
- This isn't a research study,
Leblanc.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.807
- Yeah, but she's not wrong.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.766
Dr. Leblanc, why don't you
show us how it's done,

33:05.809 --> 33:07.507
release the volar compartment.

33:07.550 --> 33:10.249
- Leblanc have you ever done
an ED fasciotomy before?

33:10.292 --> 33:12.077
- I've done the reading.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.122
- She's not ready.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.428
What are you doing?

33:15.471 --> 33:17.865
- This is a teaching hospital,
Mark.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.519
I'm teaching.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.570
- Retracting.

33:28.354 --> 33:29.572
Scissors?

33:32.967 --> 33:35.448
- Good.
Release the next compartment.

33:35.491 --> 33:38.494
Keep the motion smooth.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.019
- All compartments released.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.325
- That should do it.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.849
Apply and secure wet dressing.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.721
- Welcome home.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.748
- Hi, Owen.

34:15.226 --> 34:18.143
You're getting better,
but you still need to stay warm.

34:18.186 --> 34:21.581
So I went out and picked up
this bad boy.

34:24.018 --> 34:27.065
If you want it, grab it.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.676
It's up to you.

34:30.938 --> 34:35.072
- He's really not waking up,
is he?

34:38.598 --> 34:40.513
- No, Owen. He's not.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.786
- I almost love it.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.918
Lie to your own damn sister,
sir.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.139
We should get t-shirts made
with that on them.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.315
- Look, I know what I said was
unprofessional, okay?

35:00.359 --> 35:03.536
But that guy
was basically emotionally
extorting his family.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.408
I guess I'm off that surgery.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.888
- Why?

35:07.931 --> 35:10.108
Just because patients get sick
doesn't mean we can't

35:10.151 --> 35:11.674
occasionally find them
annoying.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.938
I'm not condoning insulting them
moments before an operation.

35:14.982 --> 35:17.724
But we all lose our cool.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.118
[grunts]

35:20.161 --> 35:22.120
Medical record consent forms.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.948
Get your father to sign them and
you can access his chart.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.776
- Uh, about my dad.

35:27.342 --> 35:32.391
I'm not up to date on his
condition because we don't talk.

35:33.261 --> 35:35.916
- I'm his doctor, June.
And your boss.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.136
I don't want that information.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.970
- I appreciate you pitching in
this last month.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.669
- But my services
will no longer be required?

35:53.455 --> 35:57.851
- Mark. I was too tough on you
when you were a resident.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.853
When I look back now.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.507
I put you through hell.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.291
Should have been a better
mentor to you,

36:03.335 --> 36:05.337
and for that, I apologize.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.992
Maybe it's how I was
trained too,

36:09.036 --> 36:12.344
but that's no excuse for paying
it forward. For either of us.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.303
- So you're apologizing,

36:15.347 --> 36:17.697
but you're still saying
I'm never gonna be good enough.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.048
- No, that's not what
I'm saying.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.878
There's no question
you're a skilled doctor, Mark.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.664
If you want to stay, work under
Wendy, we could try again.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.014
But...

36:31.058 --> 36:33.713
I don't think you're ready,
as a leader.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.933
- I'll pass, thanks.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.631
- Up to you.

36:40.937 --> 36:45.072
Hamed, his transcripts.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.728
If anyone else were
to look under that rock.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.426
- They'll find me.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.345
[sighs]

37:11.707 --> 37:12.969
- You fixed her?

37:13.013 --> 37:14.449
- Yes.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.409
She's going to need a lot
of rest, but she'll be okay.

37:19.411 --> 37:23.632
- The first time you ran away,
you were only nine.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.548
I was so scared.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.421
Dad knew you were in the shed.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.513
He said we should pretend
we didn't know where you were.

37:35.470 --> 37:38.038
You needed
the independence and...

37:38.734 --> 37:41.084
You always came back
feeling better.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.912
- He hid snacks in there
for me.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.262
- Yeah.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.615
I know I'm not him, baby.

37:51.138 --> 37:54.272
I know I'm gonna get a lot
of stuff wrong.

37:55.316 --> 37:58.711
But I promise you,
I'm gonna try.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.585
I love you so much.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.504
[gentle music]

38:22.387 --> 38:24.606
- Are you gonna fly home
tonight?

38:25.912 --> 38:28.654
Seems like a good night to go
hug the girls.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.876
- I can't.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.751
- Hey.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.622
What's wrong?

38:43.843 --> 38:45.627
- Mel and I split up.

38:48.674 --> 38:51.503
I chose this and
she wasn't okay with it.

38:53.766 --> 38:56.290
- Theo. I'm so sorry. I--

38:56.334 --> 38:58.945
- No, I just... I guess
I thought she'd change her mind.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.644
That was stupid.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.780
- Hey, why don't you come
to our place tonight, huh?

39:07.823 --> 39:10.260
We'll make some dinner.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.221
- I don't think I'd be great
company, uh...

39:14.830 --> 39:16.963
- Well, Theo, if--

39:17.006 --> 39:19.313
- You know, I'm fine, Bash.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.665
I'll see you later.

39:39.028 --> 39:42.031
- You know, it was some
good work you did back there.

39:43.555 --> 39:44.991
Anyway.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.387
It hasn't been boring.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.477
- Are you leaving us?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.043
- Back to ICU.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.711
Guys like us,

40:09.755 --> 40:12.105
we might not fit
into a place like this.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.325
But don't let them turn you into
something that you're not.

40:26.685 --> 40:29.601
- So he really has
a brain tumour?

40:29.644 --> 40:31.864
- A benign one, but yeah.

40:34.127 --> 40:37.783
I really want to hate him,
but it's sort of not his fault.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.525
- Screw that! You don't owe
him any empathy, Mags.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.396
- Well, maybe it's not
that easy for me!

40:43.528 --> 40:45.094
- Ooh.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.359
Okay.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.191
It's cool. Look, um...

40:57.716 --> 41:03.635
If you need to yell at anyone,
or whatever,

41:03.678 --> 41:07.421
just, I'm here, alright?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.075
- Okay.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.295
- Okay.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.494
[in Arabic]:

41:43.326 --> 41:45.459
- Rania's teaching me
to play tricks.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.895
- Hey.

41:46.939 --> 41:49.202
- We waited for you, for dinner.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.333
- I will heat it.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.907
- Where did you find playing
cards?

41:58.951 --> 41:59.995
I didn't know we had any.

42:00.039 --> 42:02.084
- I saved them from
the airplane.

42:03.129 --> 42:05.261
- Are we going to keep those
old rocks too?

42:05.305 --> 42:08.264
- I found them in the park,
by the first place we had.

42:09.265 --> 42:11.746
- Rania tells me you're not
ready to unpack.

42:12.312 --> 42:15.315
- You're the one who's
still sleeping on the couch.

42:18.448 --> 42:21.887
- Amira. We're still figuring
out what this looks like.

42:21.930 --> 42:24.454
But that doesn't mean we're
going anywhere.

42:24.498 --> 42:25.978
This is your home now.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.849
You can get comfortable.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.898
- The rocks go in my closet.

42:32.941 --> 42:34.682
Top shelf.

42:34.726 --> 42:37.293
The rest of it,
I'm still deciding.

42:43.038 --> 42:45.214
[gentle music]

42:54.484 --> 42:56.399
[cutlery clattering]

43:21.686 --> 43:24.906
Subtitling: difuze
