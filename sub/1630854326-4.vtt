00:21.313 --> 00:22.856
You know what, Hugo?

00:22.856 --> 00:25.067
I'm always going on about myself.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.110
Tell me about your life.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.195
So,

00:28.737 --> 00:30.697
you have a girlfriend back home or what?

00:31.281 --> 00:34.785
Well, there is this girl, Natalia.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.912
She's not my girlfriend.
We're just lab partners.

00:36.912 --> 00:37.955
But one day...
-Yeah.

00:37.955 --> 00:41.083
...she asked to borrow a pen
when she already had a pen.

00:42.376 --> 00:46.421
Or was it a mechanical pencil?
-Wow. Amazing story. I love it.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.216
So, it was Valentine's Day in 1985.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.134
No, wait. My story wasn't over.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.427
Yes, it was.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.013
It was Valentine's Day, 1985.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.477
And at Las Colinas, we were all excited.

01:02.271 --> 01:06.233
A cheap, corporate-created U.S. import
that's invading our country

01:06.233 --> 01:08.694
and making it more generic every year?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.237
No thanks.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.407
Valentine's Day is the fast-food
chain of holidays.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.617
<i>Okay, not all of us were excited.</i>

01:15.617 --> 01:18.912
That's exactly the same face
Máximo made when I told him

01:18.912 --> 01:21.415
I didn't want anything cheesy today.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.417
He's so cute.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.587
And you two have been dating,
what, nine days now?

01:26.587 --> 01:27.838
Yes?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.840
It's weird that you know that and I don't.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.593
Who keeps track of a relationship
like that?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.178
Nine days.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.014
I love keeping track
of our relationship like that.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.557
Congrats, "hermigo."

01:38.557 --> 01:41.185
You two got any big plans tonight?

01:41.185 --> 01:43.395
She's not really into Valentine's Day.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.272
But it makes it easy for me, right?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.149
The pressure's off.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.901
Yeah, sure.

01:48.901 --> 01:52.070
How about you?
Is Chad doing anything special?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.989
Nah, he's not really that kind of guy.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.449
We're just staying in tonight.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.992
It'll be nice.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.953
Hey, hey.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.914
Hi.
-<i>We were all happy.</i>

02:01.914 --> 02:05.292
<i>Even if Julia and I
were still uncomfortable.</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:09.213
<i>But Valentine's Day
would bring all of that to the surface.</i>

02:09.213 --> 02:10.881
<i>And more.</i>

02:10.881 --> 02:14.551
<i>Before the day was over,
some relationships would grow closer,</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:17.387
<i>one would break apart
in order to come back stronger,</i>

02:17.387 --> 02:22.184
and one would end forever.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.854
Really? Do you always have to
make things a mystery?

02:27.814 --> 02:30.275
I don't know. Do I?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.361
Just tell the story.

02:33.862 --> 02:38.283
You see, Valentine's Day can put
a lot of pressure on relationships.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.453
Including secret ones.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.335
Well, that was fun.

02:49.086 --> 02:53.215
It was mind-blowing,
and your hair didn't even move.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.008
<i>After months of hookups,</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:58.345
<i>something had changed
in Diane and Héctor's relationship.</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:01.348
<i>For one of them,
it was still a meaningless fling.</i>

03:01.348 --> 03:07.396
<i>But for the other one,
it had become something much, much more.</i>

03:08.564 --> 03:11.567
The grounds crew is already out.
Take the back way so no one sees you.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.403
By the way,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.030
happy Valentine's Day.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.790
Gross.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.711
For a minute, I thought you were serious.
-Of course not.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.254
So gross.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.257
Back way.
-Oh, yes.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.153
<i>Meanwhile,
it was Lorena's last day in Acapulco</i>

03:56.153 --> 03:58.238
<i>before going back to Mexicali.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:00.449
<i>Ever since she and Memo started dating,</i>

04:00.449 --> 04:03.035
<i>they found it impossible
to get any time alone.</i>

04:06.622 --> 04:08.582
No hands!

04:09.082 --> 04:12.085
<i>Still,
Memo was determined to convince Lupe</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:15.422
<i>to let them spend
their last evening alone together.</i>

04:17.507 --> 04:18.884
Lupe.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.805
I come here today to profess my love.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.850
What?
-Not for you! For Lorena.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.560
Your niece...

04:28.560 --> 04:31.730
...my great, true love is leaving tomorrow.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.857
Which is why I insist that you
allow us to go on one date,

04:33.857 --> 04:35.984
on this special day of love.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.570
I will not take no for an answer.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.280
No.
-Okay.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.200
<i>As for me, I was still looking for a way</i>

04:43.200 --> 04:44.910
<i>to prove myself to Diane.</i>

04:44.910 --> 04:48.372
<i>So I decided to go further than
just her usual newspaper.</i>

04:48.372 --> 04:50.457
Here's your coffee and your newspaper.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.626
And a Danish.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.962
And a small plant
to brighten up your office.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.130
And a pack of mints.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.384
And a muffin,
in case you don't like the Danish.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.887
Thank you for all these loose objects.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.766
Actually,
I have an important assignment for you.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.103
For months, we've been offering
a deluxe Valentine's Day package

05:11.103 --> 05:13.897
in our presidential suite,
but no one's booked it.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.023
Until this morning.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.484
And what's in
the deluxe Valentine's Day package?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.028
That's the fun part. I have no idea.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.156
But for what Mr. and Mrs. Teller paid,
it better be good.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.577
Do you want me to come up with something?
I love Valentine's Day.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.454
I love love. I love packages.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.373
Wonderful.

05:31.373 --> 05:35.210
I know it's a big job, but don't worry.
You won't be alone on this.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.132
All right, you two.
Fill this suite up with romance.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.557
I'll take this room!

05:48.974 --> 05:50.434
I'll take some other room!

05:56.607 --> 06:00.819
<i>Meanwhile, Sara was still dealing with
her own heartbreak.</i>

06:11.830 --> 06:14.833
<i>She blamed your</i> abuela
<i>for her breakup with Roberta.</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:19.671
<i>But, of course, she couldn't say that,
so her anger came out in weird ways.</i>

06:21.298 --> 06:22.799
That's really loud.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.219
I can turn the TV down.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.514
I mean your chewing. It's so loud.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.476
I'm eating a banana. I'm hardly chewing.
-Uh-huh.

06:32.476 --> 06:36.480
And yet it still sounds like
you have a mouth full of screws.

06:42.528 --> 06:46.490
No. I can't hear anything. And look
how close my ears are to my mouth.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.994
Oh God, it feels so good to have a hook.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.080
Oh, Esteban! Come talk to us. Please!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.415
Happy Valentine's Day!

06:55.415 --> 06:57.042
Now get out.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.544
Get out?

06:58.544 --> 07:02.840
If that's okay.
I want to cook a surprise dinner for you.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.509
I'm making pulpo enamorado.

07:05.509 --> 07:06.635
Dammit, that was supposed
to be a surprise.

07:07.010 --> 07:07.845
Yes, mama...

07:07.845 --> 07:09.012
Get out.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.681
Fine.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.475
But you need to come with me.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.936
I need your help--
I didn't get him anything!

07:16.854 --> 07:18.313
Yes, both of you go--

07:18.313 --> 07:20.190
I don't want you to see
the heart-shaped flan I'm making.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.733
Again?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.695
We're going.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.574
Flowers. Balloons.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.451
Champagne. Rose petals.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.538
This sucks, doesn't it.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.622
It's total trash.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.251
What do we do?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.753
Chocolate covered strawberries!

07:42.796 --> 07:45.215
Don Pablo taught me how to
make a swan out of a napkin.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.218
I could turn two towels into
kissing swans on the bed.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.846
Oh, sure. I can picture
Mr. and Mrs. Teller now...

07:50.846 --> 07:53.599
Holy moly, Susan.
The swans are made out of towels.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.517
I told you it was gonna be
worth all our money.

07:55.517 --> 07:59.354
Oh, I'm sorry it's not as brilliant as
"Chocolate covered strawberries!"

08:04.776 --> 08:07.070
Why is it so weird between us?

08:07.070 --> 08:09.573
We can't even be in
the same room together.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.701
I know, it is weird.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.163
I miss being friends.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.457
What happened?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.586
What happened was the balcony...

08:59.540 --> 09:01.291
Héctor, the ladies' man.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.585
I see you checking out that babe.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.672
Nah.
-So, any plans for the big V-day?

09:06.672 --> 09:09.258
I mean,
you must be juggling so many chicks.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.510
There's only one chick
I care about juggling.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.847
It sounds like somebody tamed the beast.

09:14.847 --> 09:18.475
Well, tell me about this babe.
Come on, man. Spill it.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.061
What's she like physically, you know?
Is she my type?

09:22.646 --> 09:23.814
In a way, yes.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.774
You have a lot in common.

09:25.774 --> 09:29.528
Oh, come on, no. I want details, okay?
Is she older, is she younger?

09:29.528 --> 09:31.655
She's... older.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.909
Yes, I knew it. She's a hot mama.
Mama, mama, mama.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.077
Please don't say "mama."

09:37.077 --> 09:40.205
MY LITTLE MAMA IS HOT!!!
-Okay.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.207
Hey, you better be careful.
I might make a move on her.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.292
I really hope not.

09:43.292 --> 09:46.587
Chad and the <i>mamacita</i> hooking up.
Just picture that.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.839
I'm trying not to.
-Hey, you know what?

09:48.839 --> 09:50.757
If things cool off with Julia,

09:50.757 --> 09:52.467
does she have a sister?
-No.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.761
Just a son.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.890
Oh, gosh.
<i>Papacito</i>, you're gonna be a daddy.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.600
No.
-Yes.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.144
Doesn't matter anyway, okay?

10:03.145 --> 10:06.023
She seems to be cooling on me now.
-Wait, on Valentine's Day?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.608
Yes, I know.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.111
I even got her a giant stuffed animal,
and now I--

10:11.111 --> 10:12.738
A giant stuffed animal?

10:12.738 --> 10:15.073
Dude, you're dating a real woman, okay?
A mother.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.618
You can't-- If somebody got my mother
a giant stuffed animal,

10:17.618 --> 10:19.453
I would--
I would laugh in their face, okay?

10:19.453 --> 10:22.456
You need to go big if you like her.
Put it all on the line.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.834
Take a chance.
Get her something nice like "hoo-lery."

10:27.419 --> 10:30.047
You know?
'Cause the "J" is silent with you guys?

10:43.602 --> 10:46.063
Pleasure doing business.

10:53.278 --> 10:57.324
Okay. Do you want to...
talk about the balcony?

10:57.324 --> 11:00.452
Yes! No. I mean...

11:00.452 --> 11:04.915
You said what happened
there was a mistake...

11:08.210 --> 11:09.503
...and I agree.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.796
Right. It was stupid.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.923
So stupid. It was nothing.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.591
Less than nothing!
It didn't mean anything.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.135
But it still happened!
And it's driving me crazy.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.470
And if I don't say what's been
on my mind then

11:18.470 --> 11:19.805
I'm going to explode, but I can't

11:19.805 --> 11:20.973
because I can't tell anyone.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.140
You can tell me.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.727
No. I can't.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.398
I'm embarrassed.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.446
Here, put this over your eyes.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.365
This is a weird time for a piñata.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.158
No. If we don't have to
look at each other,

11:40.158 --> 11:42.786
it'll be easier to say
what's on your mind.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.872
Here, I'll show you.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.796
I'm the one who ate
Lupe's yogurt last week.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.800
I feel so much better now!

11:56.800 --> 11:59.678
Okay... my turn...

12:05.225 --> 12:06.226
Okay.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.187
Here I go.

12:14.026 --> 12:19.489
I've just been carrying this huge weight
on my shoulders after that...

12:21.033 --> 12:22.534
...kiss.

12:22.534 --> 12:28.832
And I feel like I should tell Chad,
but that could end our relationship;

12:28.832 --> 12:35.047
and I feel I should tell Isabel,
but that could end your relationship;

12:35.047 --> 12:37.049
and I want to talk to you about it,

12:37.049 --> 12:43.889
but it's made things so weird between us.

12:45.849 --> 12:50.854
I just feel like I'm disappointing
everyone no matter what I do.

12:50.854 --> 12:54.191
I'm so overwhelmed.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.451
It never happened.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.578
What do you mean?

13:07.162 --> 13:11.917
If it never happened, then you have
nothing to hide from Chad or Isabel.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.046
If it never happened, then
you don't have to feel overwhelmed.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.217
If it never happened, then...

13:20.217 --> 13:23.178
...we can be friends again.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.806
We're the only two people who were there.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.058
It's our story to tell.

13:28.058 --> 13:31.728
So all we have to do is say it didn't
happen, and...

13:32.896 --> 13:34.690
...it never happened.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.235
It never happened.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.654
It never happened.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.038
Paris.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.207
What?

13:53.250 --> 13:55.919
The lights remind me of all
the lights in Paris...

13:56.420 --> 13:59.840
I think we still have some props
left from that Model U.N. we hosted.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.177
Right. The kitchen could make
coq au vin and croissants...

14:03.177 --> 14:07.764
Chad's got an antique record player
that could look cool here...

14:07.764 --> 14:09.683
Let's get started.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.147
You have more luck with Lupe than I did?

14:15.147 --> 14:18.942
No. She still insists on watching us
anytime we're together.

14:19.735 --> 14:20.944
Even now.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.452
Looks like this will be
our Valentine's Day.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.578
Well,

14:30.078 --> 14:31.788
we'll have to make it last.

14:42.841 --> 14:46.678
Ah, to be young and in love.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.223
You know who those two remind me of?

14:49.223 --> 14:54.603
You and that one with the skinny
little legs, who worked in the gardens?

14:56.647 --> 14:59.274
Mauricio.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.736
May he rest in peace.

15:03.362 --> 15:08.033
Those skinny little legs didn't
help him out-swim that shark.

15:08.784 --> 15:12.204
You used to look at each other
the same way...

15:12.996 --> 15:16.959
This must really take you back.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.011
I know you don't like to talk
to your mother about some things, but

15:28.011 --> 15:31.348
I want you to know that I'm here for you.

15:32.558 --> 15:36.728
Thanks. Let's just focus
on getting Esteban's gift.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.691
Do you think he'd like this?

15:42.150 --> 15:44.653
Yeah, it's perfect.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.366
Hello, my name is Esteban and
I'm a REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE!

15:50.284 --> 15:52.953
While staying under the speed limit.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.664
And is there a seat belt on this thing?

15:55.664 --> 15:58.542
Oh, come on, Sara. No.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.753
It's more like this...

16:01.753 --> 16:03.213
...pay attention.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.299
Here goes...

16:05.966 --> 16:09.011
I'm Esteban, the king of rock and roll!

16:09.011 --> 16:13.724
But, if it's too loud, I can turn it down.
Is that good?

16:13.724 --> 16:17.728
You know what, I'll just turn it off.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.532
Diane, as we agreed,

16:30.532 --> 16:33.327
I'm letting you know early
about any personal time.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.997
Next weekend,
I'll be visiting my son and grandson.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.082
I wish I could say yes,

16:39.082 --> 16:42.127
but we have so much work to do
for that Hollywood party next month.

16:42.127 --> 16:45.714
In fact, we have to start talking
about invitations, catering--

16:49.468 --> 16:51.845
Let's put a pin in this conversation,
shall we?

16:53.597 --> 16:54.640
Okay.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.062
Is this a joke?

17:00.062 --> 17:03.732
If loving you is a joke,
then I am the world's biggest clown.

17:04.525 --> 17:08.237
Diane, I have been with hundreds--
No, dozens of women.

17:09.070 --> 17:14.535
But none compare to you,
Diane Davies, <i>mi amor</i>.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.744
Okay, I think there's been
a misunderstanding here.

17:16.744 --> 17:20.290
I will never leave you.
I will always be here.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.376
What? No. What is that?

17:22.376 --> 17:24.711
You agreed,
this was supposed to be casual.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.796
But, <i>mi amor</i>--

17:25.796 --> 17:27.005
Please stop calling me that.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.384
In fact, you know what?

17:30.384 --> 17:31.927
You ruined it.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.762
I'm sorry, Héctor, it's over.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.306
Wait.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.599
Over?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.894
Okay, fine.
We don't have to love each other.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.480
Just meaningless sex. Three times a week.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.608
And an occasional candlelit dinner,
we share our intimate secrets.

17:46.608 --> 17:47.526
Oh, God, no.

17:47.526 --> 17:50.237
Okay, fine. No dinner. Just sex.

17:50.237 --> 17:53.323
And light conversation.
We talk about what we're watching on TV.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.992
Héctor, you need to go.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.703
And if anyone finds out about us,
you're fired.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.038
Okay.

18:00.706 --> 18:01.832
I'm going.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.545
Final offer.

18:06.545 --> 18:09.214
I won't say a word, just sex.
You say when.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.049
I'm just a prop. Take it or leave it.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.634
Get out!
-I said I'm going.

18:20.434 --> 18:21.435
There he is!

18:21.435 --> 18:24.104
Whoa, looking slick.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.940
How'd it go?
-Not so good, Chad.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.942
Not so good.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.360
No.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.323
Here. You can give this to Julia.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.078
Yeah, thanks, man,
but this really isn't her style.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.501
Hey, Héctor.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.214
Whoever turned you down,
her son's missing out on a great dad.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.555
Now this is starting to feel like Paris.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.723
Have you ever been?

18:59.723 --> 19:02.142
No, but I'm definitely going to
live there someday.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.520
Maybe show my clothes at Fashion Week.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.397
Great.
I'll visit you there in my private jet.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.899
It's a date.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.115
Great... I love them.

19:20.494 --> 19:24.039
Hands up! It's the cool police!

19:24.039 --> 19:26.708
Don't worry, it's not a real gun.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.837
Although once I did get robbed by a man
who just pointed his fingers at me.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.089
But that's because it was very dark.

19:32.089 --> 19:35.342
I need to get a picture of you.
Where's the camera?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.761
I think it's on my dresser.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.012
Don't you dare take that off!

19:40.764 --> 19:43.392
The food smells great!

19:43.392 --> 19:47.729
Well, pulpo enamorado is a special recipe
that's been in our family for generations.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.815
It was carefully passed down from
my great-grandmother to my grandmother,

19:49.815 --> 19:52.901
and then from my grandmother to my mother,
and then from my mother to me.

19:52.901 --> 19:57.030
Every measurement must be precise.
Every ingredient just so.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.907
It's extremely complicated

19:59.157 --> 20:00.492
so I made chicken.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.745
That story is very...

20:04.580 --> 20:07.624
Mom, what's taking so long?

20:07.624 --> 20:10.294
The camera's right on the--

20:16.967 --> 20:19.219
Memo, this is terrible.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.930
I begged <i>Tía</i> Lupe one more time
to let us go on a date,

20:21.930 --> 20:23.515
but then she said I have to work. Tonight.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.018
So now the only way
for us to spend time together

20:26.018 --> 20:29.188
is if you help me in the laundry room.
-The laundry room?

20:29.188 --> 20:32.316
So we're supposed to spend
Valentine's Day folding fitted sheets?!

20:32.316 --> 20:34.610
You're so angry!

20:34.610 --> 20:36.862
I love it.

20:36.862 --> 20:38.947
And towels?! And pillow cases?!

20:38.947 --> 20:40.866
Keep naming linens! It's so sexy.

20:40.866 --> 20:43.702
And tablecloths?! And napkins?!

20:43.702 --> 20:46.330
This is our last night together!

20:46.330 --> 20:49.416
This. Will. Not. Stand.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.651
"Enjoy your evening together - Lupe"

21:21.365 --> 21:23.492
So this whole time,

21:24.743 --> 21:26.537
it wasn't Máximo and Roberta,

21:26.537 --> 21:28.038
it was... Roberta and you.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.415
Sara, how could you do this?

21:30.415 --> 21:32.042
It's a sin!
-But we--

21:32.042 --> 21:34.837
What if people find out?
What would they say?

21:35.838 --> 21:37.798
I don't know--

21:38.632 --> 21:39.883
Cool police!

21:39.883 --> 21:41.885
You're under arrest for failure
to report to dinner...

21:44.346 --> 21:49.309
I can put some foil over it
so it doesn't get cold.

21:53.939 --> 21:58.527
And what about your future?
How do you think you'll make a family?

21:59.403 --> 22:02.281
There's nothing more important than that.

22:02.281 --> 22:05.826
My life would be nothing
without my children.

22:05.826 --> 22:08.704
I don't know. I just--

22:08.704 --> 22:11.623
I'm not sure I want a husband.

22:11.623 --> 22:15.794
How would you know? You've never
even tried to be with a boy!

22:15.794 --> 22:18.338
I've never felt like trying.

22:18.714 --> 22:20.549
I can't believe it!

22:23.427 --> 22:25.179
What would your father say?

22:27.931 --> 22:29.057
So sorry--

22:29.057 --> 22:31.351
Where do you keep your foil?

22:34.813 --> 22:36.398
I'll find it.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.908
We did it.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.452
How do you say "great work" in French?

22:48.452 --> 22:51.788
Oh, it's [gibberish French sounds].

22:52.956 --> 22:56.919
Well, [gibberish French sounds]
to you too.

23:01.507 --> 23:04.009
I'm glad we're friends again.

23:04.843 --> 23:06.011
Me too.

23:06.345 --> 23:09.598
They'll be here soon.
Should we do a final walk through?

23:10.474 --> 23:11.600
Mrs. Teller, my dear,

23:11.600 --> 23:14.061
may I show you around
our glorious Parisian suite?

23:14.061 --> 23:17.356
Oh, why, Mr. Teller,
this is absolutely divine.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.818
Expensive champagne. Ooh-la-la.

23:21.818 --> 23:24.279
Oh, don't worry.
It was only a million dollars.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.657
They were out of
the two-million-dollar champagne.

23:30.994 --> 23:33.413
This is awesome.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.706
Wait, did you do all this?

23:34.706 --> 23:38.252
Yeah, but we should get going.
The Tellers should be here in any minute.

23:38.252 --> 23:39.753
No, sweetie.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.421
We are the Tellers.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.174
I booked this suite under a fake name
to surprise you.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.511
Told you we were staying in,
but I didn't say where.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.638
Oh, my God. You're amazing.

23:52.391 --> 23:55.185
I can't believe you had to prepare
your own suite.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.897
Well, my friends, have a wonderful night.

24:00.232 --> 24:02.276
Thanks, Máximo. You too.

24:02.276 --> 24:03.735
Oh, my God.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.405
Hey, I have a record player
just like that one.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.952
It's going to be okay.
Here's what we'll do.

24:11.952 --> 24:17.457
We'll pretend this never happened,
we'll never speak about Roberta again,

24:18.542 --> 24:21.211
and you'll grow out of this phase.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.380
Phase? Mom--

24:23.380 --> 24:28.051
You're a teenager. You're confused.

24:28.051 --> 24:32.723
We'll forget this and move on.

24:36.101 --> 24:40.063
Mom, listen to me! That's not--

24:40.689 --> 24:42.858
I can't do that.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.027
I don't want to do that.

24:45.027 --> 24:48.614
It's a sin.

24:48.614 --> 24:50.115
I can't have
someone living in my home who...

24:50.115 --> 24:52.117
continues to behave that way.

24:52.117 --> 24:57.748
Well, I'm not going to live in a place
where I have to lie about who I am!

25:03.128 --> 25:04.838
Sara...

25:07.090 --> 25:09.927
I can't accept that part of you.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.430
Mom. I meant what I said.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.058
It's not right.

25:24.233 --> 25:26.193
I'm sorry.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.363
I can't tell you that it's okay.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.699
I'm sorry.

25:39.206 --> 25:40.415
I hate you!

25:43.418 --> 25:44.837
And then, Hugo,

25:45.462 --> 25:48.173
your mother and <i>abuela</i>
said some things to each other

25:48.674 --> 25:50.467
that I'll never repeat to you.

25:52.427 --> 25:56.139
It would take a long time for them
to get over what happened that day.

25:58.851 --> 26:02.855
Of course, at the time,
I had other things on my mind.

26:15.534 --> 26:16.827
Máximo.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.746
I know our plans
aren't until tomorrow night,

26:19.746 --> 26:22.291
but I wanted to drop by
and give you these.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.793
Chocolates. How...

26:24.793 --> 26:25.752
...cheesy.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.129
Not just any chocolate.

26:27.129 --> 26:31.216
I stole each one of these chocolates
off pillows in guest rooms at Las Colinas.

26:31.717 --> 26:33.677
Just for you.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.430
They're perfect!

26:46.857 --> 26:47.941
Joe,

26:49.526 --> 26:51.820
that extra stop you put on the itinerary?

26:51.820 --> 26:52.946
Wait, hold on a second.

26:52.946 --> 26:55.407
The one you told me
that you definitely did not want to go to,

26:55.407 --> 26:57.618
and was angry at me for even suggesting?

26:57.618 --> 26:59.161
Yeah. That one.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.663
Do you mind looking into it after all?

27:03.373 --> 27:07.169
That's a wonderful idea, boss.
I'd be happy to take care of that for you.

27:07.836 --> 27:11.089
So, it's Isabel you're going to see.

27:11.757 --> 27:12.883
I don't know.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.885
Is it?

27:16.094 --> 27:17.763
Imagine what it's like
working for the guy.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.348
I don't know how you do it.
-It's torture.

27:19.348 --> 27:20.682
But, as I said,

27:21.808 --> 27:26.146
that Valentine's Day
changed us all in different ways.

27:27.981 --> 27:30.067
<i>Some relationships grew closer</i>.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.581
<i>One relationship ended forever.</i>

27:47.084 --> 27:50.128
<i>And even though
one day things would change,</i>

27:50.128 --> 27:52.673
<i>and despite neither one wanting it,</i>

27:53.257 --> 27:55.968
<i>one relationship was shattered.</i>
