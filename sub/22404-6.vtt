08:49.528 --> 08:52.114
- She still tells
me that I'm nice.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.159
- Oh, she does.
- Yeah, she does.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.745
- Ulch.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.454
How long has he
been up there?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.791
- About five minutes.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.334
- Well it feels like six.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.047
[ both arguing ]

09:08.130 --> 09:10.299
- All right,
I've had enough a'this.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.805
Charlotte, will you pick up
that popcorn I dropped?

09:15.888 --> 09:19.350
- Nah, Schwoz'll just
eat it off the floor.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.979
- Family helps family!

09:23.062 --> 09:25.147
- I'm not gonna get involved
in your little schemes, Piper!

09:25.231 --> 09:28.234
I'm not gonna help you.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.902
- I know Jasper is low voltage--
- I have my own ambitions.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.446
- But I think he can watch--
- I have my own dreams.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.323
- All right, all right,
that's enough,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.325
knock it off, c'mon,
I mean it.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.414
I don't wanna hear any more
arguing in this junk store.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.000
- Fine.
- You're not the boss of me.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.963
- That is true.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.756
But I am the boss
of your brother, Henry,

09:50.840 --> 09:52.591
and since you're
directly related to Henry

09:52.675 --> 09:55.386
via the transitive property,
ex post facto,

09:55.469 --> 09:57.263
as long as you're standing
in this commercial property,

09:57.346 --> 09:59.724
vis-à-vis, I am,
in fact, somewhat..

09:59.807 --> 10:02.768
the boss of you.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.353
- What?!?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.273
- Piper, you're creating
a disturbance in my workplace!

10:07.356 --> 10:09.525
- Oh please,

10:09.608 --> 10:12.403
I've never seen anybody
"work" in this place!

10:12.486 --> 10:13.571
- Okay. Well..

10:13.654 --> 10:14.613
- Look at Jasper...

10:14.697 --> 10:16.449
just sittin' there,
doin' nothin'

10:16.532 --> 10:19.910
but stuffin'
his face fulla popcorn!

10:22.288 --> 10:25.207
- Piper, go!

10:25.291 --> 10:28.044
- Hey! You're his boss...

10:28.127 --> 10:29.378
- Dang right.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.549
- Then tell him that when
a guy's nice little sister

10:33.632 --> 10:34.884
needs help to make
a meet-cute happen,

10:34.967 --> 10:36.344
her nice brother
should say yes

10:36.427 --> 10:38.512
and do his best to make
her dreams come true!!!

10:40.139 --> 10:40.973
- Yeah man,
what's wrong with you?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.558
- What?!?

10:42.641 --> 10:43.225
- She needs a favor man,
she's your family,

10:43.309 --> 10:44.226
man, she's your sister.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.520
- I-I get that but--

10:46.604 --> 10:47.605
- Do you have any idea
what I'd give

10:47.688 --> 10:48.397
to have my sister back?!?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.776
But I never will...

10:51.859 --> 10:56.530
all because of a dark,
rainy Wednesday in Kansas...

10:56.614 --> 11:00.034
and that terrible,
awful farm accident.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.787
- Oh my god, seriously?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.789
- No. But it happens.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.917
So, maybe you should
appreciate having a sister

11:08.000 --> 11:09.085
who's still here,
and breathing

11:09.168 --> 11:10.795
and not under a dirty
tractor wheel in Kansas!

11:10.878 --> 11:15.257
- Okay, what planet
have I landed on?!?

11:15.341 --> 11:16.926
- Y'know, you've spent
more time whining

11:17.009 --> 11:18.511
about why you won't help me,

11:18.594 --> 11:20.930
when if you had helped me
we'd be done by now

11:21.013 --> 11:23.391
and I'd have a boyfriend
named Jackson!

11:23.474 --> 11:24.642
- Look Piper,
I want to help you but--

11:24.725 --> 11:26.560
- Kid, go help her.
- I have to pack for my New York

11:26.644 --> 11:28.187
- That's an order.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.357
- I'm on my lunch break man.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.608
- Piper, c'mon, let's go.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.487
- Oh yay!
This is gonna be so great!

11:36.570 --> 11:37.697
- Oh yeah so great.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.452
- Hey, no eating on the job.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.584
- I'm on my lunch break.

12:02.221 --> 12:02.972
- There...
over there, see him?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.306
The cute boy in the blue jacket?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.976
- Yeah, I see him.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.144
- Isn't he cute?!?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.854
- I have no opinion on that.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.106
- Well trust me,
he's super cute.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.107
- Alright. Cool.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.402
Okay. Boy. Blue Jacket.
Super cute.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.570
Now can we please
get this over with?

12:17.653 --> 12:19.321
- Yeah hang on, wait...

12:19.405 --> 12:20.739
- What is that?
- Giving you a disguise--

12:20.823 --> 12:22.074
just hold still and be quiet!

12:22.158 --> 12:24.493
- What!?!
Wh--why is this necessary?!?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.245
- 'Cuz! When Jackson
becomes my boyfriend,

12:26.328 --> 12:27.079
he's gonna meet
you some day,

12:27.163 --> 12:28.122
and I don't want him to think

12:28.205 --> 12:29.999
my own brother
tried to jack my phone!

12:30.082 --> 12:32.710
- Alright well..
But what about--

12:32.793 --> 12:33.752
yeah okay, that makes sense.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.884
- We good?
- Now bend down.

12:39.967 --> 12:43.471
- Why do I have t--
- 'Cuz I said bend down!

12:47.099 --> 12:48.517
- Yeah Mom,
I sent you the flowers.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.060
- You did? Why?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.854
- Ah, no reason.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.314
- Oh c'mon, whats the reason?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.190
- Just 'cuz you're my mom.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.149
- Oh my god..
You're perfect!

12:55.232 --> 12:58.402
- Okay, okay,
you look good.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.195
- Yeah I dunno 'bout this.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.030
- You remember the animatic?

13:01.113 --> 13:01.697
- Yeah, how'd you make that?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.574
- I'll tell you later!

13:03.657 --> 13:06.118
Just go hide, and get ready!
Go!

13:11.832 --> 13:16.337
No way! Your mom
got a new car!

13:16.420 --> 13:18.631
Does it have a sunroof?
It does?

13:18.714 --> 13:20.549
Oh my gosh,
when you open it,

13:20.633 --> 13:23.928
can you see the sky?
You can?!?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.804
- Hey!
Gimme your phone!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.932
- Whaaaaa?!?

13:28.015 --> 13:31.268
No! Oh my gosh, HELP!

13:31.352 --> 13:33.395
- Haaa!
- That jerk just stole my phone!

13:33.479 --> 13:35.397
- Hey whoa man!
Just give her back her--

13:35.481 --> 13:38.609
- WHAT THE BUTT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOIN'?!?

13:38.692 --> 13:40.110
- OH MY GOD!!!

13:48.536 --> 13:49.495
- Here's your phone, kid.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.248
- Great, thanks so much.

14:02.800 --> 14:07.429
- This was not covered
in the animatic.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
[ on screen ]
- Oh come on.

14:16.188 --> 14:16.981
There's no way
Kevin can James.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.608
- Yes he can!
He's Kevin!

14:19.692 --> 14:20.359
- If anyone can James,
it's him!

14:20.442 --> 14:22.695
[ laughing ]

14:22.778 --> 14:23.946
- C'mon Kevin!

14:24.029 --> 14:25.364
Show 'em how to James!

14:31.287 --> 14:31.954
- Uh, you wanna help me?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.664
- Why?
Did you help me?

14:33.747 --> 14:38.168
No.
You ruined my meet-cute!

14:38.252 --> 14:39.962
- Oh my gosh, Henry,
what happened?!?

14:40.045 --> 14:40.546
- Hen, are you okay?!?

14:40.629 --> 14:43.549
- No! I'm not.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.135
- All right,
tell us what went down.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.428
- Oh I'll tell ya
what went down!

14:47.511 --> 14:52.141
My body! Down!

14:52.224 --> 14:53.851
Through a table!

14:53.934 --> 14:55.603
Onto the floor!

14:55.686 --> 14:57.646
- What's this green stuff?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.524
- Probably avocado.
For toast.

15:00.608 --> 15:04.903
- Sooo, Piper's animatic
didn't work in real life?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.155
- It woulda worked!

15:06.238 --> 15:07.906
If Henry had done
his part right!

15:07.990 --> 15:10.159
- Well what was I
supposed to do?!?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.869
I ran across the room!

15:11.952 --> 15:16.540
I grabbed your phone!
I said my line!

15:16.624 --> 15:18.500
But before Jackson could run in,

15:18.584 --> 15:20.169
some powerful woman grabbed me,

15:20.252 --> 15:22.421
and hurled me across the room!

15:22.504 --> 15:25.674
Geez!

15:25.758 --> 15:29.511
- Well, why'd you let her throw
you across the room?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.889
- She didn't offer me
another option, Charlotte.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.476
- Whatever, just get cleaned up
so that we can

15:35.559 --> 15:36.644
go back to Downtown Brown
and try again.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.479
- Are you insane?!?
I'm not trying again.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.563
- We have to try again!

15:39.647 --> 15:41.857
- Nah, I dough not either,
no I dough not!

15:41.940 --> 15:43.108
- You said dough.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.526
- I meant do,

15:44.610 --> 15:46.570
everybody here knows I meant do!

15:46.654 --> 15:50.032
- I have a question.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.326
Why's it so important for you
to have this "meet-cute"?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.535
- Huh?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.663
- Why can't ya just
go over to Downtown Brown,

15:55.746 --> 15:57.623
walk up to this uh...
this uh boy you like..

15:57.706 --> 16:00.334
- Jackson Bartell.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.086
- Okay him...

16:02.169 --> 16:05.047
and just say, "Hi Jackson,
my name is uh..."

16:07.841 --> 16:10.260
- Piper!
- Piper, my name is Piper...

16:10.344 --> 16:12.096
and I really like you...

16:12.179 --> 16:14.390
soooo what do you think a'that?"

16:14.473 --> 16:15.516
- Oh Ray, come on.

16:15.599 --> 16:19.395
- That would never work
in the real world!

16:19.478 --> 16:22.398
Except maybe for old people!

16:22.481 --> 16:23.649
- Hey, I am not old!

16:23.732 --> 16:25.776
- Oh please, what are you,
like thirty?

16:25.859 --> 16:28.237
- No I am n--

16:28.320 --> 16:30.197
Yeah.
Yeah, I am like, thirty.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.367
- Whatever. Just tell Henry
that he has to help me--

16:33.450 --> 16:36.370
and I need you guys to help me
think of a new meet-cute plan!

16:36.453 --> 16:37.913
- Noooo!
- Yes!

16:37.996 --> 16:40.958
- Look Paper, I know that
you're like seven

16:41.041 --> 16:42.418
and you think you know
everything...

16:42.501 --> 16:44.962
- I'm Piper and I'm twelve!

16:45.045 --> 16:47.256
- Be that as it may...

16:47.339 --> 16:49.717
I'm gonna show you
that young love

16:49.800 --> 16:50.968
can begin with
something as simple as a,

16:51.051 --> 16:54.930
good old fashioned
"Nice to meetcha, howdaya do."

16:55.013 --> 16:56.765
- Yeah, try that.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.600
- C'mon, let's go.
- No!

16:58.684 --> 16:59.601
I'm not going 'til we come up

16:59.685 --> 17:00.936
with another meet-cute plan,

17:01.019 --> 17:02.104
and then I have to make
an animatic of it!

17:02.187 --> 17:04.189
- When did you learn how
to make animatics?!?

17:04.272 --> 17:06.108
- That's not the point!

17:06.191 --> 17:08.026
Look we're going to do this my
way, so that I--

17:13.240 --> 17:14.532
- Alright...

17:14.616 --> 17:16.952
I'm gonna carry her over
to Downtown Brown.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.119
- Good, take your time.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.005
- Wh...what's...
what's going on?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.966
- Ahhh,
look who's waking up.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.229
- H-H-how'd
I get back here?

17:44.313 --> 17:48.734
- Look, life's not about
how we get places.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.819
It's about what happens
at those places,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.988
after we've gotten there.
Here.

17:53.071 --> 17:54.114
- Huh?

17:55.741 --> 17:58.118
- So, where's this
allegedly "cute boy"

17:58.202 --> 17:59.161
you wanna meet so bad?

17:59.244 --> 18:02.498
- Oh...he's um..

18:02.581 --> 18:03.165
He's right over there!

18:03.248 --> 18:05.542
In the cool blue jacket!

18:05.626 --> 18:07.169
- Okay, so I'm gonna
stay right here,

18:07.252 --> 18:09.671
and I want you to walk
right over to that boy

18:09.755 --> 18:11.715
and say, "Hi.
My name is Paper Hart,

18:11.799 --> 18:13.842
and I would like to
introduce myself to you

18:13.926 --> 18:16.095

- AHHHHHH!!!

There's a big bug
on the coffee bean display!

- Oh my god it's a scorpion!

18:21.725 --> 18:24.603
- All right everybody,
lets just calm down okay!

18:24.686 --> 18:25.896
You know uh..

18:25.979 --> 18:28.232
I used to be a better
than average tennis player,

18:28.315 --> 18:30.484
back in my day.
Ya mind?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.655
All right,
Mister Scorpion...

18:37.658 --> 18:39.535
don't take this
personally, but,

18:39.618 --> 18:42.621
game, set, and SMASH!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.000
- What was that?

18:53.006 --> 18:54.883
- Jackson!
Quick!

18:54.967 --> 18:58.887
Somebody call an ambulance!!!

18:58.971 --> 19:02.641
- Why don't you get
a better tennis racket, guy?!?

19:06.645 --> 19:09.231

19:16.613 --> 19:18.991
- All right, let's get him out
from under that coffee thing!

19:22.327 --> 19:23.412
- You guys see what happened?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.289
- Yeah, there was a big scorp--

19:25.372 --> 19:26.748
- Uhhh, I'm the adult.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.959
So uh, apparently,

19:29.042 --> 19:30.878
that poorly constructed
display case

19:30.961 --> 19:32.838
just fell off the wall,
for no reason

19:32.921 --> 19:35.340
that anyone can prove.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.599
- Listen, Popper...

19:43.682 --> 19:45.767
I know you're sad, and...

19:45.851 --> 19:48.437
I'm sorry that you didn't get
to have the "meet-cute"

19:48.520 --> 19:50.188
that you wanted.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.273
- Yeah, yeah.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.733

lady paramedic

19:52.816 --> 19:55.444
is about the same height as me?

19:55.527 --> 19:58.280
- Yeah? So?

19:58.363 --> 20:00.782
- Uh, 'scuze me...

20:00.866 --> 20:02.910

behind that door over there?

20:02.993 --> 20:06.830
- Uh...yeah okay.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.134
Wh..wha--hey,

20:19.217 --> 20:20.385

20:43.325 --> 20:44.326
