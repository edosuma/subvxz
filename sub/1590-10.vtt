To wonder why you
keep disappearing.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.796
Well, I've seen the
other teams practicing,

12:11.798 --> 12:13.998
And we're still
going to qualify!

12:14.000 --> 12:17.102
I can fly fast enough
to make up the distance.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.838

teams you're practicing with

12:19.840 --> 12:21.973
Needs a little more
help than the other one.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.743

working out with the winners

12:24.745 --> 12:27.979

12:27.981 --> 12:30.749

will still qualify!

got a minute?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.352
Uh, sure.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.857
You could really be an
asset to our team so,

12:38.859 --> 12:41.526
