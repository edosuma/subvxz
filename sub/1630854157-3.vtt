is I saw Lois strutting around
your front yard,

basically putting on
a sex show for Joe.

10:53.302 --> 10:54.544

No, I do all my own research.

I can't believe you would
beat up your own friend.

Fine, Peter.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.394
So what if I was
putting on a show?

12:09.545 --> 12:11.712
At least someone
was in the audience.

12:11.732 --> 12:15.291
And maybe ask yourself why
I'd even feel I have to do that.

12:15.310 --> 12:17.310
I come out of the bathroom
in my underwear last night

12:17.404 --> 12:20.129

of marriage,

your naked body has pretty much
no effect on me anymore.

12:31.826 --> 12:34.753
It's basically like staring
at a chair from the DMV.

I became so excited

by all that's happened
is that Peter's a good friend

15:38.254 --> 15:40.329
and perhaps the affection
you two share

15:40.348 --> 15:42.331
was briefly channeled towards me

15:42.350 --> 15:44.943

of the importance

in a single apartment.

19:18.399 --> 19:19.640
Okay, I'm back in.

19:19.734 --> 19:22.234
Boy, you really made
some mistakes in your life,

19:22.387 --> 19:25.738
haven't you,
you little piece of trash?

19:25.890 --> 19:27.832
(moaning)

19:27.983 --> 19:30.075
Uh, there's someone else
in here.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.244
-Oh, my God!
-What the hell?

19:32.397 --> 19:34.413
Principal Shepherd?
You're in here, too?

19:34.565 --> 19:36.749
Yeah, I got into a slap fight
with the Applebee's hostess

19:36.918 --> 19:38.401
because they wouldn't
turn on Fox News.

19:38.419 --> 19:40.178
Y-You know what,
we'll wait till we get home.

19:40.329 --> 19:41.512
(chuckles)
We're so sorry.

19:41.664 --> 19:43.923
For what?
I didn't tell you to stop.

19:44.075 --> 19:46.517
Um... okay.

19:47.836 --> 19:50.021
(moaning)

19:51.599 --> 19:53.082
<i> Oh, Peter!</i>

19:53.100 --> 19:54.358
<i> PETER:</i>
<i> Oh, Lois!</i>

19:54.510 --> 19:55.935
<i> SHEPHERD:</i>
<i> Can you call out the names</i>

19:56.087 --> 19:57.862
<i>of garbage people from Fox News?</i>

19:57.939 --> 19:59.197
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i> Oh, Hannity!</i>

19:59.348 --> 20:00.423
<i> PETER:</i>
<i> Oh, Tucker!</i>

20:00.516 --> 20:02.182
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i> Oh, Judge Jeanine!</i>

20:02.202 --> 20:03.534
<i> PETER:</i>
<i> Oh, Steve Doocy!</i>

20:03.761 --> 20:05.928
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i> Uh, who's that terrible</i>
<i> blonde lady</i>

20:05.947 --> 20:07.354
<i> whose own family hates her?</i>

20:07.373 --> 20:08.431
<i> SHEPHERD:</i>
<i> Laura Ingraham.</i>

20:08.449 --> 20:10.766
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i> Oh, Laura Ingraham!</i>

20:10.859 --> 20:11.959
<i> Yes!</i>

20:17.866 --> 20:19.383
Oh, Peter, I'm so glad

20:19.610 --> 20:22.053
we were able to discover
this new level of intimacy.

20:22.204 --> 20:24.388
I-I've never felt
so connected to you.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.539
Me either.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.466
And I never knew
your biggest fantasy

20:27.618 --> 20:30.228
was to do it as a cat
from a children's book.

20:30.379 --> 20:32.355
(moaning)

20:33.900 --> 20:35.307
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> For most of the night,</i>

20:35.460 --> 20:37.217
<i> Peter gooshed on her flumpkus.</i>

20:37.386 --> 20:38.885
<i> She crunkled his wanz-it.</i>

20:38.980 --> 20:40.479
<i> He boobled her bumpkus.</i>

20:40.631 --> 20:44.300
<i> The bangle-bong lasted</i>
<i> till first break of day.</i>

20:44.393 --> 20:46.969
<i> Six times that night</i>
<i> she screamed,</i>

20:46.988 --> 20:49.247
<i> "Zazu-ki-zay!"</i>

20:49.398 --> 20:50.748
The end.

20:50.899 --> 20:52.141
Good night, Stewie.

20:52.234 --> 20:54.627
Don't read me books
that you write.
