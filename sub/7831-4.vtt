14:10.349 --> 14:14.080
Well, that hideous creep
doesn't scare me.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.952
[Screaming]

14:18.057 --> 14:21.549
<i>Mom, Dad, help!</i>
<i>He's trying to kill me!</i>

14:21.660 --> 14:23.628
Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.924
They're like this every rainy day.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.022
[Grunting]

14:31.503 --> 14:33.562
[Growling]

14:36.208 --> 14:38.199
Get my filthy hands
off my sister!

14:39.612 --> 14:43.571
No, don't eat me!
You don't know where I've been!

14:45.651 --> 14:48.916
You just made
a big mistake, fly boy!

14:50.723 --> 14:52.554
[Grunting]

14:54.693 --> 14:56.388
Hey, it worked!

14:56.495 --> 14:59.020
Well, we were lucky this time.

14:59.131 --> 15:03.033
But it's all too clear that some things
in this universe...

15:03.135 --> 15:05.330
aren't meant to be trifled with.

15:05.437 --> 15:10.841
- Homer, what are you doing?
- Something I should have done a long time ago.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.138
I'll teach you to mess
with my machine!

15:13.245 --> 15:16.476
- [Screams]
- I'm gonna chop you good!

15:16.582 --> 15:18.607
That cost me 35 cents!

15:18.717 --> 15:21.777
You're just making it worse!
I promise I won't hurt you!

15:29.762 --> 15:32.731
<i>[Animal Howling]</i>

15:34.466 --> 15:37.492
<i>[Quimby] You are all hereby found guilty</i>
<i>of the crime of witchcraft.</i>

15:37.603 --> 15:40.663
I sentence you hags
to be burned at the stake...

15:40.773 --> 15:43.742
until you are deemed fit
to reenter society.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.868
Fire it up, boys.

15:46.979 --> 15:50.642
- [Crowd Cheering]
- Ha-ha!

15:50.749 --> 15:53.946
- See you in hell, Seymour!
- Good-bye, Mother.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.112
How horrible!

15:56.221 --> 15:59.452
If they're really witches, why don't
they use their powers to escape?

15:59.558 --> 16:02.652
- That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.
- Never mind.

16:02.761 --> 16:05.093
Well, that's 75 witches
we've processed.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.893
That oughta show God whose
side we're on, eh, Pastor?

16:08.000 --> 16:12.198
Yes, Nedwin, but we have
many more strumpets to incinerate.

16:13.906 --> 16:17.706
Brothers and sisters, there is still
a witch among us.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.973
Let us throw open the floor
to, uh, wild accusations.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.571
Whoo-hoo!
I accuse Goodie Flanders!

16:23.682 --> 16:25.775
- [Gasps]
- [Crowd Murmuring]

16:25.884 --> 16:27.852
I accuse Goodie Badwife.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.853
Uh, we killed her on Sunday.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.923
There must be someone
here we can accuse.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.652
- Lisa Simpson!
- Bart, quit it!

16:34.760 --> 16:36.728
She put a spell on me!

16:36.829 --> 16:39.229
Must... drop... pantaloons.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.698
[Groans]
Let's come to our senses, everyone.

16:42.801 --> 16:45.361
This witch hunt is
turning into a circus.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.871
- She's the witch!
- [Crowd Shouting]

16:47.973 --> 16:51.966
- I was just about to accuse her.
- This is crazy. I'm not a witch!

16:52.077 --> 16:55.945
Ha! Then how come your laundry
is always <i>much</i> whiter than mine?

16:56.048 --> 17:00.985
- I've heard enough. Burn her!
- [Shouting]

17:01.086 --> 17:03.884
People, let us not turn
into an angry mob.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.755
Goodie Simpson is entitled
to due process.

17:07.859 --> 17:12.523
Okay, here's how the process works. You sit
on the broom and we shove you off the cliff.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.565
- What?
- Well, hear me out.

17:14.665 --> 17:18.295
If you're innocent, you will fall
to an honorable Christian death.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.372
<i>lf, however, you are</i>
<i>the bride of Satan...</i>

17:20.472 --> 17:23.202
you will surely fly
your broom to safety.

17:23.308 --> 17:26.675
At that point, you will report back here
for torture and beheading.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.872
- Tough, but fair.
- [Lisa] Stop!

17:28.981 --> 17:33.475
Doesrt the Bible say,
"Judge not lest ye be judged"?

17:33.585 --> 17:35.917
[Murmuring]

17:36.021 --> 17:39.047
- The Bible says a lot of things. Shove her!
- [Gasps]

17:39.158 --> 17:41.524
[Screaming]

17:41.627 --> 17:44.027
[Screaming]

17:44.129 --> 17:46.324
Brothers and sisters...

17:46.432 --> 17:48.764
we have performed
the Lord's work...

17:48.867 --> 17:52.860
and sent a good woman
into his waiting-

17:52.971 --> 17:56.168
- [Gasping]
- [Cackling]

17:56.275 --> 18:00.974
Okay, now, let's not jump
to conclusions, everyone.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.241
Well, I'll be a son of a witch.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.816
That's right, I'm a witch.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.386
And I'm the one who
withered your livestock...

18:08.487 --> 18:11.547
soured your sheep's milk
and made your shirts itchy.

18:11.657 --> 18:15.457
- Hey, you destroyed my turnip crop.
- No, that was gophers.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.029
Impossible.
We burned all the gophers.

18:18.130 --> 18:21.122
Not all of them.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.133
[Screaming]

18:23.235 --> 18:25.703
And this is for
pushing me off the cliff!

18:25.804 --> 18:28.102
- Whoa! Whoa!
- [Gasping]

18:28.207 --> 18:30.368
All right, people,
nothing to see here.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.637
Yeah, show's over, all right?
Move along.

18:32.744 --> 18:36.305
As for the rest of you-
[Cackling]

18:36.415 --> 18:38.576
[Screaming]

18:38.684 --> 18:41.448
[Gasps]
They're in my hair! They're in my hair!

18:48.527 --> 18:51.325
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.398
This needs more eye of newt.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.399
You always want more
eye of newt.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.197
If it were up to you, the brew
would be nothing but newt eyes.

18:59.438 --> 19:01.338
Well, look who's here.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.704
If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cat.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.802
What a day. They found out I was a witch,
so I had to leave my family.

19:07.913 --> 19:11.508
Really? So you finally left Durwood.

19:11.617 --> 19:14.177
His name is Homer.

19:15.787 --> 19:19.154
Oh, Neddie, look at them up there,
plotting our doom.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.056
They could force us to commit
wanton acts of carnality.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.891
- [Scoffs] Yeah, that'll be the day.
- What's that, Ned?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.124
Uh, we shouldn't fear
the witches, Maude.

19:27.232 --> 19:31.168
We're both 35. We've already gone
way past our life expectancy.

19:31.270 --> 19:34.205
But think of the children! I heard
that witches come to your house...

19:34.306 --> 19:36.672
and take your children away
to eat them!

19:36.775 --> 19:40.233
Hmm. Eat their children.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.041
Geez, we were just
gonna swipe their shoes.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.447
But a good idea is a good idea.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.625
[All Cackling]

19:57.095 --> 19:58.995
- <i>[Ned] Who is it?</i>
- [All] Witches!

19:59.097 --> 20:00.997
<i>[Maude]</i>
<i>Um, what do ya want?</i>

20:01.099 --> 20:03.067
We're here to eat your kids.

20:03.168 --> 20:05.728
<i>[Ned]</i>
<i>Okay, come on in...</i>

20:05.837 --> 20:07.737
and look at this!

20:07.839 --> 20:09.807
Oh, please.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.376
Now make with the kids.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.910
Don't blame yourself, Daddy.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.984
<i>You did everything you could.</i>

20:21.987 --> 20:25.616
[Whimpers]
Maude, do something.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.954
Oh. Uh, excuse me.

20:28.060 --> 20:32.360
Are you sure you ladies wouldn't prefer
some gingerbread children instead?

20:32.464 --> 20:34.523
- They're boneless.
- [All] Hmm?

20:38.770 --> 20:41.568
- [All] Mmm.
- <i>[Children] Ow!</i>

20:41.673 --> 20:44.198
[Hooting]

20:45.777 --> 20:48.507
Bye, witches.
Thanks for not eating me.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.514
Yeah, you hags are all right.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.811
What did you get?

20:52.918 --> 20:56.183
- A candied apple.
- I got a caramel cod.

20:57.556 --> 21:02.357
You know, scaring people
into giving us treats is fun.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.361
We should do this every year.

21:04.463 --> 21:08.559
I just wish we hadrt filled up on all
those kids before we got to the Flanders'.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.567
[Belches]

21:10.669 --> 21:14.332
[All Cackling]

21:14.439 --> 21:18.603
Yargh. And that's the story
of the very first caramel cod.

21:18.710 --> 21:21.702
I mean, Halloween.
And it wasrt long...

21:21.813 --> 21:25.874
before this yearly custom
became an annual tradition.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.657
[Children Chattering]

21:38.930 --> 21:42.559
Come on! Give us some candy!
Don't pretend you're not home.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.465
Dad, that's our house.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.834
[Crowd Laughing]

21:47.939 --> 21:50.305
- She's a witch!
- <i>[Man] Get her!</i>

21:50.409 --> 21:53.503
- [Crowd Shouting]
