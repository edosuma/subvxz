00:07.120 --> 00:08.720
[theme music]

01:41.760 --> 01:43.720
Thank you. Bye.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.680
SOCO reckon he's
been dead about a month.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.560
We'll have to wait for the
post mortem to confirm

01:53.720 --> 01:56.400
cause of death but it looks like
he's been hit over the head.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.960
If this is the victim's
passport,

01:58.120 --> 01:59.640
his name's Peter Hodges.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.680
According to the system
he was reported missing.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.120
Four weeks ago.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.680
-Who by?
-His wife.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.000
-You got an address?
-Home and work.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.520
She's a university professor.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.840
Okay. Let's do the death knock.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.480
Doesn't the Sarge want
to take a look at this?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.360
She's happy for
us to get on with it.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.920
The Sarge has got other
priorities this morning.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.560
[suspenseful music]

02:47.160 --> 02:48.680
This is our suitcase.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.960
These are my
husband's possessions.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.560
We've only been married a year.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.920
We're very sorry for your loss.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.760
We're gonna need your assistance
with a forensic sample

03:02.920 --> 03:06.240
for a comparison.
Something belonging to Peter.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.160
Of course.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.680
Did Peter take his phone
the morning he went missing?

03:10.840 --> 03:13.520
It's not been recovered as yet.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.800
The Missing Persons
team asked me to look,

03:15.960 --> 03:19.040
but I couldn't find it.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.920
We understand the MISPER
case has been downgraded.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.880
Yes, one of the neighbours
saw my husband leaving.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.080
He had a suitcase with him.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.640
The detectives decided it proved

03:27.800 --> 03:30.360
his disappearance
wasn't suspicious.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.200
I'd say they were wrong,
wouldn't you?

03:37.080 --> 03:38.680
[instrumental music]

03:55.440 --> 03:58.280
The neighbour who
saw Peter leaving?

03:58.440 --> 04:00.920
-Mrs. McCarthy?
-Yeah. Which side is she?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.520
Right. Number 17.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.920
What do you need?

04:19.080 --> 04:21.960
His comb, a pair of
glasses, his pillow case.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.160
I might as well tell you.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.000
We were sleeping
in separate rooms.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.560
Poor guy.
I can't believe he was murdered.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.880
Sorry.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.560
[sobs]
It's the shock.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.200
You gave a statement to
the Missing Persons team

04:49.360 --> 04:51.120
that you saw him
leaving the house on

04:51.280 --> 04:53.840
Friday the 17th of last month.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.160
What time was that?

04:55.320 --> 04:58.560
It was about 8.30 am.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.040
That's when my husband rings.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.920
He works away a
lot in Manchester

05:02.080 --> 05:04.760
phones before his first meeting.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.280
I was standing here,
clearing up after the kids.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.240
I saw Mr. Hodges
leave the house.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.040
-With a suitcase?
-Yes.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.720
What happened next?

05:17.880 --> 05:21.520
My husband rang.
My phone was in the kitchen.

05:21.680 --> 05:26.240
By the time I came back in here
Mr. Hodges was gone.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.640
You didn't see where
he went from there.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.160
No. Like I said, he was gone.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.600
The separate rooms,
do you mind if I ask?

05:52.720 --> 05:53.840
Umm...

05:55.600 --> 05:58.960
Before I met Peter he was
always in debt, serious debt.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.360
When we got married, he asked me
to take charge of the money

06:04.520 --> 06:06.400
so he couldn't fritter it away.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.960
He even arranged to have
his salary paid into my account.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.200
How did that work?

06:11.360 --> 06:14.040
I gave him a basic allowance
in cash

06:14.200 --> 06:16.360
just enough to cover
his day to day expenses

06:16.520 --> 06:20.040
and it worked well for a while.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.880
-But...
-But what?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.440
[sighs]

06:26.600 --> 06:28.360
We still loved each other

06:28.520 --> 06:32.600
but Peter was growing
increasingly resentful.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.920
He told me he didn't
feel like a man anymore.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.880
[suspenseful music]

06:45.640 --> 06:47.600
I've been going through
Peter Hodges' financials.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.680
He had a savings
account of his own.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.960
Two days before he disappeared,
he paid in 5000 pounds in cash.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.480
Interesting.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.640
I also went through
the receipts in his wallet

06:57.800 --> 07:00.960
and I found one for
a cafe next door to the bank.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.920
Two coffees, two sandwiches,

07:03.080 --> 07:05.960
20 minutes after
he deposited the 5K.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.720
So, he wasn't alone

07:07.880 --> 07:10.400
I requested the bank CCTV.
I'll send it to you now.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.960
That is Charlie Hill,
Peter's older brother.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.840
He's a car dealer.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.400
Hill?

07:26.560 --> 07:28.400
Peter took my surname
when we married.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.960
He was keen
to make a clean break,

07:30.120 --> 07:31.200
especially from his brother.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.080
They didn't get on?

07:35.880 --> 07:38.880
Charlie didn't approve
of our relationship.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.040
He described
Peter as my lap dog.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.240
And you had no idea Peter was
in contact with Charlie again?

07:46.400 --> 07:49.320
As far as I knew, Peter had cut
him out of his life for good.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.600
But then, Charlie always
was the arch manipulator.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.360
How come we're out
and about and the Sarge

08:04.520 --> 08:06.880
is in the office doing
all the grunt work?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.840
They were sleeping
in separate bedrooms.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.160
-Some people do.
-That's not a marriage.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.000
What's up with you lately?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.480
I haven't seen my
wife for days, or my kids.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.840
[suspenseful music]

09:06.840 --> 09:08.880
How much longer have
I got to be stuck in this dump?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.320
It's been a long night.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.280
It was the best we
could do at such short notice.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.920
If you would
just give us a name,

09:21.080 --> 09:22.600
none of this would be necessary.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.120
Guarantee my safety, and I will.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.400
You're protecting a murderer,

09:27.560 --> 09:30.680
a serving police officer
who has killed three people.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.000
That is why I need
to be absolutely sure

09:33.160 --> 09:37.120
that you are gonna keep me safe
before I tell anyone anything.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.200
What about your duty?

09:39.360 --> 09:42.520
The oath you swore.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.080
You swore you'd stay
with me till death us do part.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.520
What happened to that?

10:01.080 --> 10:04.440
Is he gonna come through,
tell us what we need to know?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.520
Your guess is as good as mine.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.400
[sighs]
You shouldn't be out and about.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.920
I want you to go straight
to the office and stay there.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.480
[sighs]

10:29.680 --> 10:31.160
She just walked out on me,
you know.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.480
Didn't even leave a note.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.320
I got home.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.680
Vivienne had packed up her stuff
and gone.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.840
[suspenseful music]

11:06.320 --> 11:09.920
-Mr. Hill?
-Who's asking?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.880
Detective Constable
Billie Fitzgerald.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.640
This is Detective
Constable Rob Brady.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.960
What's this about?

11:17.120 --> 11:18.440
Your brother, Peter Hodges.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.960
Has he turned up?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.880
I'm very sorry to tell you,

11:26.040 --> 11:27.760
Peter was found dead.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.960
Dead?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.960
Has, has there been an accident?

11:32.120 --> 11:35.920
No, the circumstances
are being treated as suspicious.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.040
What does that mean?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.120
Mr. Hill, we're investigating
your brother's murder.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.080
Ta.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.560
You told the Missing Persons
team that

11:54.720 --> 11:56.600
you haven't seen your
brother in months.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.160
[Rob]Is that accurate?

11:58.320 --> 12:00.400
Yeah.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.520
Then before I ask you
that question again,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.520
I need you to take
a look at some CCTV.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.320
This was just
over four weeks ago.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.920
[sighs]

12:19.080 --> 12:21.920
Pete didn't want Cassidy
to know we were meeting.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.680
How come?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.520
Because she's controlling,
suffocating.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.280
[Charlie]She treated
him like a child.

12:28.440 --> 12:32.120
He had to ask her for every
penny, permission to breathe.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.560
Why were you in a bank together
two days before he disappeared?

12:35.720 --> 12:37.440
I lent him some cash.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.640
Why?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.680
An escape fund.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.200
Well, how do
you explain the fact that

12:42.360 --> 12:44.120
the money's still
in Peter's account?

12:44.280 --> 12:45.880
He never touched it.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.560
What?

12:47.720 --> 12:50.600
No, I, I just
assumed that when he disappeared

12:50.760 --> 12:52.440
he'd used it to get
away from that witch.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.200
So, your brother didn't
contact you after he left?

12:54.360 --> 12:56.000
No.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.040
Are you sure?

12:58.200 --> 12:59.880
Do I need to remind you
this is a murder investigation?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.720
I swear I've never
heard from Pete again.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.840
This is Peter
Hodges, 33 years old.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.600
He worked in maintenance at
Royal Ashford University for the

13:18.760 --> 13:21.480
last eight years, which is
where he met his wife, Cassidy.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.040
[Rob]She's a doctor,
neuroscience.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.400
Proper high flyer, written
books and everything.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.200
They sound very
chalk and cheese.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.240
They are. Our victim
has a history of getting

13:30.400 --> 13:32.360
himself into serious
financial trouble.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.880
According to Cassidy,
when they got married,

13:35.040 --> 13:37.360
Peter asked her to
take care of their finances,

13:37.520 --> 13:39.960
keep him out of any temptation.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.520
That's not how
his brother sees it.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.600
He reckons Peter was
the victim of coercive control.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.520
You should meet Cassidy Hodges,
Sarge, see what you make of her.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.120
Okay. Set it up.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.760
Sarge! I've been talking to Rob

14:08.920 --> 14:11.760
or, rather, he's been talking
to me.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.400
About?

14:13.560 --> 14:14.560
The fact that
he had to send his family away

14:14.720 --> 14:17.680
because
they were threatened.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.320
What else did he say?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.000
Only that I should speak to you.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.960
Is Vivienne seeing anyone?

14:34.160 --> 14:36.560
The Detective Sergeant
is a very private person.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.760
What about you and her?

14:42.240 --> 14:43.560
[scoffs]

14:43.720 --> 14:46.040
I'm not gonna dignify
that with an answer.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.000
Turn you down, did she?

14:51.680 --> 14:52.840
Get a life!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You have no
idea of the pressure.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.480
You're a disgrace.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.480
I am still your senior officer.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.720
So, what are
you gonna do, report me?

15:09.840 --> 15:11.400
[sighs]

15:11.560 --> 15:14.040
So, the Chief Super has
been covering for a murderer?

15:14.200 --> 15:17.960
This guy killed Tyler Bates,
Grace Harper and Harry Steadman.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.960
But Tyler Bates
was a police officer.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.360
We think the killer is too.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.600
So the minute I met
Mulgrew I didn't like him.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.600
Something really
creepy about him.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.960
[cell phone beeps]

15:33.720 --> 15:35.280
I need to respond to this.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.840
Billie,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
not a word to anybody.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.080
Yeah, of course.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.840
-This is my Detective Sergeant.
-Vivienne Cole.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.560
I take it you spoke
to Peter's brother.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.000
We did.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.760
Let me guess,

16:05.920 --> 16:09.080
according to Charlie Hill
I'm a control freak, a monster.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.240
He's said to my
face often enough.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.720
Why do you think Peter was back

16:12.880 --> 16:14.440
in contact with
his brother again?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.920
[scoffs]

16:18.080 --> 16:21.520
To have a good time,
spend money, be carefree.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.760
My husband was
addicted to spending.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.680
He knew that he had
to go cold turkey to

16:30.840 --> 16:33.080
have any chance of
conquering that addiction.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.920
So, you took
charge of the finances.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.640
Tell me, Sergeant,
are you married?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.760
I was.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.360
Then it won't be foreign to you
that in a trusting relationship

16:47.520 --> 16:50.520
what's mine is
yours is quite normal.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.400
Were you aware that
Peter had a savings account?

16:54.480 --> 16:56.400
No, I was not.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.200
Was there any money in it?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.600
5000 pounds.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.240
According to Charlie,
it was his running away fund.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.320
But the odd thing is that

17:06.480 --> 17:08.000
he never got round
to spending any of it.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.360
All that means...

17:12.880 --> 17:13.960
All that means it that he was
killed

17:14.120 --> 17:15.560
before
he could withdraw it.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.600
[suspenseful music]

17:27.240 --> 17:28.840
The press reporting
of Peter Hodge's murder

17:29.000 --> 17:30.320
has paid dividends.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.320
A local journalist
received an anonymous

17:32.480 --> 17:34.920
tip off about the
morning he disappeared.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.160
The caller saw a car hanging
around outside

17:37.320 --> 17:39.560
the Hodges' house.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.000
The description they
gave of the car is of interest,

17:42.160 --> 17:45.680
an orange Subaru Impreza,
rear spoiler.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.240
Sounds like the car Charlie Hill
was working on this morning, eh?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.640
Yeah, the one he was so keen
to cover up when we arrived.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.800
Yeah, so maybe Dr. Hodges
was right about Charlie Hill.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.240
[music continues]

18:17.080 --> 18:18.480
Officers...

18:20.360 --> 18:22.280
You got any news?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.320
Where's the car you
were working on this morning,

18:24.480 --> 18:26.240
the souped-up Subaru?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.200
So, the owner
came to collect it.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.360
Can we get their
name and address?

18:30.520 --> 18:31.960
Yeah. Be in the office.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.760
[dramatic music]

18:38.560 --> 18:41.000
Oy!

18:41.160 --> 18:43.040
[Rob]Open the door!
Open the door!

18:49.400 --> 18:51.360
[dramatic music]

19:04.720 --> 19:06.960
Control, Detective
Constable Fitzgerald.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.760
All units be on the look out
for an orange Subaru Impreza,

19:10.920 --> 19:12.560
no call index.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.400
Driver is wanted in connection
with the murder of Peter Hodges.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.720
Come on!

19:28.240 --> 19:30.040
Don't do this to me!

19:41.360 --> 19:42.880
That's the car.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.160
So much for a
customer collecting it.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.320
-He's locked it.
-Of course he has.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.680
Yeah, it's DC Brady.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.800
[police] It's open now.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.800
Number plates are false.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.120
Surprise, surprise.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.200
St. Christopher.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.560
Wasn't our murder victim wearing
one of these in their photo?

20:32.880 --> 20:34.360
Looks like a match to me.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.680
Yeah.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.520
[instrumental music]

20:47.640 --> 20:49.200
According to
Cassidy Hodges, Peter

20:49.360 --> 20:50.520
never took off
the St. Christopher.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.640
So, it was definitely his?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.000
I reckon so, but
the lab will confirm it.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.840
So, dead or alive,
Peter Hodges was in

20:58.000 --> 20:59.600
the stolen car that
his brother's driving?

20:59.760 --> 21:00.760
At some point.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.800
[cellphone vibrating]

21:03.960 --> 21:05.520
David? What's happening?

21:15.960 --> 21:17.480
What's that for?

21:17.640 --> 21:20.840
I can't imagine what
you've been going through.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.040
One thing I don't
understand, though,

21:23.200 --> 21:26.880
how did Vivienne and David get
the Chief Super to play ball?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.520
The Sarge didn't tell
you absolutely everything, then?

21:29.680 --> 21:31.400
What?

21:31.560 --> 21:33.960
Vivienne and Mulgrew
used to be married.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.680
Rob! We need you
to take over from the

21:38.840 --> 21:40.760
Detective Inspector
at the safe house.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.240
He needs to go to HQ.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.880
I'm on my way.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.640
[phone ringing]

21:53.800 --> 21:57.280
Detective
Constable Fitzgerald...

21:57.440 --> 21:58.760
Thanks for letting me know.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.080
Charlie Hill just
handed himself in.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.280
Apparently, he's worried
we think he killed his brother.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.200
Oh, I wonder why he thinks that.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.680
I didn't kill Pete.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.840
Why did you run, then?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.200
-Panicked.
-Why?

22:20.360 --> 22:22.520
Because of that orange Subaru.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.680
We suspect that it's stolen.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.240
The engine and chassis
numbers have been removed.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.080
Tell us, Charlie,
did you do that?

22:31.720 --> 22:33.720
Yes.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.680
Me and Pete,
we were stealing cars.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.080
When did this start?

22:39.240 --> 22:40.520
A few months back.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.280
Pete needed some
cash to leave Cassidy.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.840
He was always
good with electronics.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.320
He got hold of, like, a scanner.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.080
You point it at the car
and the owner thinks

22:51.240 --> 22:53.880
it's secure when it's
locked, but it isn't.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.120
The thing is, we're not so
concerned

22:55.280 --> 22:56.760
that the car was stolen.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.320
What we care about
is whether your brother, Peter,

22:59.480 --> 23:01.200
was ever inside the Subaru.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.280
No, never.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
-Are you sure?
-100%.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.160
Perhaps you'd like
to explain this, then.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.680
It's a St. Christopher's medal.

23:18.840 --> 23:21.440
It's like the one
Cassidy gave to Pete.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.040
It was found in the
boot of the orange Subaru.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.680
No, that's impossible.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.560
Why?

23:28.720 --> 23:30.400
I told you, Pete
was never in that car.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.920
I only nicked
the Subaru last week.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.480
So, you can't explain Peter's

23:35.640 --> 23:37.880
St. Christopher
being in the Subaru?

23:38.040 --> 23:39.400
[Billie]Could someone
have planted it there?

23:42.280 --> 23:45.560
-It's possible, I guess.
-How?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.880
Well, the same way Pete
got into the cars he nicked,

23:49.040 --> 23:50.440
using the scanner.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.080
Charlie's story holds up.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.920
The orange Subaru
was reported stolen

24:00.080 --> 24:01.880
three weeks after
Peter went missing.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.600
So, who planted the evidence?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.680
-How's he been?
-Pain in the neck.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.160
Alright.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.760
[intense music]

24:48.040 --> 24:49.360
I am sorry, you know.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.040
About what?

24:56.080 --> 24:57.440
That he threatened your kids.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.600
I assume they're still safe.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.240
They are.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.200
I'm glad to hear that.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.760
So, what kind of hold
has this guy got over you?

25:17.920 --> 25:21.880
He saved my life, which
meant that I owed him, big time.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.560
Did you know I used to box?

25:28.880 --> 25:30.240
I wasn't half bad.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.160
I could paste
you all over those walls.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.960
Believe me,

25:38.120 --> 25:39.760
nothing would give
me greater satisfaction.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.960
Why don't you, then?

25:45.560 --> 25:48.200
Because I need you to identify
the man that threatened my kids.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.640
And I need him to be locked up,

25:53.800 --> 25:55.280
behind bars...

25:57.280 --> 25:59.520
so that I can hold my
babies in my arms again.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.800
[suspenseful music]

26:18.960 --> 26:20.760
You are kidding me.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.720
What?

26:23.880 --> 26:26.480
Mila McCarthy,
the Hodges' neighbour.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.400
There's no way she
could have seen Peter Hodges

26:28.560 --> 26:30.520
leaving around 8.30
on that Friday morning.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.000
How come?

26:32.160 --> 26:33.640
When I spoke to her
this morning something

26:33.800 --> 26:35.600
wasn't right, so I ran
a check on her financials.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.520
According to
her debit account records,

26:37.680 --> 26:41.040
Mila was putting petrol in
her car at 8:27,

26:41.200 --> 26:42.640
three miles from home.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.760
[knock on door]

26:52.520 --> 26:54.080
[knock on door]

26:58.480 --> 26:59.720
Can we come in?

27:02.800 --> 27:04.240
What's going on?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.280
I'm going to arrest
you for murdering Peter Hodges

27:13.440 --> 27:14.960
and for perverting
the course of justice,

27:15.120 --> 27:16.480
and then these
officers are going to

27:16.640 --> 27:18.240
conduct a search of
your property.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.960
What's going on?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.040
We've made an arrest.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.920
Mrs. McCarthy.
You think she killed Peter?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.440
I can't say much at the moment.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.760
I'll ask the
Detective Sergeant to

27:47.920 --> 27:49.720
give you a ring,
bring you up to speed.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.640
Mila, you gave a statement
saying you saw Peter Hodges

28:07.800 --> 28:13.200
leave home at around 8:30
on the morning he disappeared.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.160
This is a receipt for
petrol paid for

28:16.320 --> 28:18.840
on your debit card at 8:27.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.080
Quite the trick, being
in two places at once.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.480
I dropped my kids off at school,

28:32.640 --> 28:34.640
got some petrol on
the way to the supermarket.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.400
Did you see Peter Hodges
leave the house with a suitcase?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.400
[sobbing]
No.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.160
[suspenseful music]

28:59.640 --> 29:01.200
I looked at Peter Hodges
call data again.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.120
The last time
he used his mobile was

29:03.280 --> 29:05.640
at 9 o'clock on
the Thursday night.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.040
So, he could have
been killed before Friday.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.080
That's what I'm thinking.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.400
This is footage
from a CCTV camera

29:12.560 --> 29:15.240
near the deposition
site, on Thursday,

29:15.400 --> 29:17.080
just before midnight.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.000
I can't get
a clear registration yet,

29:19.160 --> 29:22.280
but I'm sure that's
Mila McCarthy's car.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.240
You know, if Mila is the killer,

29:24.400 --> 29:25.800
then she'd have
had to have planted

29:25.960 --> 29:27.240
the St. Christopher
in Charlie's car.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.520
Using a scanner.
I find that hard to believe.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.440
Yeah, so do I.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.000
Who would be clever
enough and arrogant enough

29:34.160 --> 29:37.080
to think that they could
get away with all of this?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.080
-Cassidy Hodges.
-Exactly.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.560
What were you doing on the
evening of Thursday the 16th?

29:49.640 --> 29:51.000
The night before you
said you saw

29:51.160 --> 29:53.560
Peter leaving with the suitcase.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.120
I was at home with the kids.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.560
-All night?
-Yes.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.360
-You didn't go out.
-No.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.880
And what was your
car doing near Millwall Stadium

30:05.040 --> 30:07.360
at 23:48 that evening?

30:11.680 --> 30:13.040
That is your car, isn't it?

30:15.560 --> 30:16.760
Yes.

30:18.600 --> 30:23.240
Mila,
did you kill Peter Hodges?

30:23.400 --> 30:24.680
[sobbing]
No.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.960
Then who did?

30:28.520 --> 30:30.080
-I can't tell you.
-[Sarge]Why?

30:30.240 --> 30:31.760
I just can't.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.240
-Right, she's coming in.
-Who is?

30:48.400 --> 30:50.280
The victim's wife,
Cassidy Hodges.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.200
I told her I want to
update her on

30:52.360 --> 30:53.880
the progress
of the investigation.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.520
And what are you really up to?

30:55.680 --> 30:58.280
We think she killed her husband.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.840
We just have to prove it.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.480
-How's it going?
-Good.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.720
The Deputy Assistant
Commissioner will be here soon.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.280
Rob's bringing Mulgrew
in to speak to her.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.600
We have a deal?

31:14.200 --> 31:15.680
Yes. I think we do.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.760
He doesn't deserve
to be protected.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.880
After what he's done,
he should be going to prison.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.640
[suspenseful music]

31:35.480 --> 31:37.080
We have reason to believe

31:37.240 --> 31:39.320
that your husband was
killed on the Thursday night,

31:39.480 --> 31:41.080
which means we need to
recalibrate

31:41.240 --> 31:43.080
our investigation timeline.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.800
Can you tell me where
you were that evening?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.920
[scoffs]
As I told you, I was out

31:49.080 --> 31:51.200
to dinner with friends.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.920
Uh, Italian restaurant
on Upper Street.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.360
What time did you get home?

31:56.520 --> 31:58.280
Late, very late.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.760
-I walked all the way.
-From Upper Street?

32:00.920 --> 32:03.600
Yes. I'd been drinking,
wanted to clear my head.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.520
I left the restaurant
about half-eleven,

32:05.680 --> 32:06.880
so I can't have got home until

32:07.040 --> 32:08.560
nearly one o'clock
in the morning.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.840
When you got home, did you
see your husband, speak to him?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.120
No, I assumed
he was fast asleep.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.200
In his own room?

32:17.360 --> 32:19.640
That's right.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.880
One more thing,

32:22.040 --> 32:26.520
where were you between 10:00
and 11 o'clock this morning?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.080
At home,

32:28.240 --> 32:31.440
coming to terms with
my husband being murdered.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.320
Thank you. That's very helpful.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.400
Cassidy Hodges told
us she was out for dinner

32:39.560 --> 32:41.200
with friends the night
her husband was killed.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.960
The dinner checks out,

32:43.120 --> 32:45.400
but she paid for her
meal earlier than she told us.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
If she caught a taxi
rather than walked.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.240
She could have been
home in 20 minutes.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.360
So, she had plenty
of time to get home,

32:52.520 --> 32:54.280
kill her husband and
dispose of his body.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.160
-When was the body dumped?
-Just before midnight.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.560
CCTV shows Mila's car
in the area.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.640
I've requested urgent
call data for Cassidy's phone.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.160
She told us she was
home this morning.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.840
Grieving.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.240
But cell site puts her
very close to Charlie's garage.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.920
And what was she up to?

33:12.080 --> 33:13.960
She was planting her
husband's St. Christopher

33:14.120 --> 33:16.520
in the car that she
took to be Charlie's.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.120
Alright, that's more
than enough for me.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.960
Arrest her and search
her home address.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.680
-Thank you for waiting.
-I've had enough.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.720
-You can call a taxi for me.
-Circumstances have changed.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.320
What do you mean
circumstances have changed?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.400
Cassidy Hodges, I'm
arresting you on suspicion

33:36.560 --> 33:38.600
of the murder of your
husband, Peter Hodges

33:38.760 --> 33:41.200
I came in here voluntarily.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.680
You do not have to say anything,
but may harm your defence

33:43.840 --> 33:45.400
if you do not mention
when questioned,

33:45.560 --> 33:47.760
something which you
later rely on in court.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.320
Anything you do say, may be
given in evidence.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.880
Do you understand?

33:59.800 --> 34:03.120
I just need to
swing by my office,

34:03.280 --> 34:06.360
pick up a couple
of personal items.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.160
It won't take a moment.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.640
Make it quick.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.600
Mila, I'm Detective
Inspector David Bradford.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.600
I'm here to tell you that
we've arrested Cassidy Hodges

34:26.760 --> 34:28.480
on suspicion
of murdering her husband.

34:31.680 --> 34:33.360
Why don't you tell
us what really happened, Mila?

34:36.320 --> 34:37.280
[sobs]

34:37.440 --> 34:39.040
Cassidy bashed Pete's head in.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.960
Go on.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.320
Cassidy came home early,

34:49.480 --> 34:50.800
found us in bed together.

34:52.640 --> 34:54.960
You were having an affair?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.640
We slept together a few times.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.040
We were both lonely.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.680
That night,
we were saying goodbye.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.400
He had enough
money to leave her.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.680
What happened when Cassidy found
you together?

35:10.080 --> 35:12.680
She went crazy,

35:12.840 --> 35:16.120
shouting and screaming at Pete.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.680
He tried to lock
himself in the bathroom,

35:19.840 --> 35:21.720
but she was so strong.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.200
He didn't stand a chance.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.440
Did you see Cassidy kill Peter?

35:29.680 --> 35:31.640
No.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.040
I heard a terrible noise,

35:35.200 --> 35:36.520
then it all went quiet.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.640
By the time I got to
the bathroom door...

35:42.360 --> 35:44.400
he was on the floor.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.080
There was so much blood.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.960
Did you see what
Cassidy hit Peter with?

35:52.720 --> 35:54.000
No. Not really.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.880
It was in her hand.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.560
Something shiny.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.160
What happened next?

36:06.400 --> 36:09.080
Cassidy said
it was all my fault.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.440
She threatened to tell
my husband what I'd been up to.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.760
I couldn't let her do that.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.640
And then?

36:20.400 --> 36:23.240
Cassidy can't drive.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.200
She made me drive my car,
so she could dump Pete's body.

36:28.800 --> 36:29.920
It was horrible.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.800
[intense music]

36:58.600 --> 37:02.120
[police]Oh, in here,
Detective! If you don't mind.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.600
What have you found?

37:12.360 --> 37:15.240
This is a joke.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.640
When did you
last see Charlie Hill?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.520
I told you,

37:19.680 --> 37:22.440
over a year ago, at
our engagement party.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.840
He didn't call round today?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.360
Of course not.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.080
Cell site data
for your phone shows you

37:31.240 --> 37:33.040
close to Charlie Hill's
garage this morning.

37:35.720 --> 37:40.040
You were there
from 10:26 until 10:31.

37:40.200 --> 37:45.760
Plenty of time to plant
evidence in a car.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.720
You might be interested to know
your trip was a waste of time.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.160
Charlie didn't
steal the car until

37:51.320 --> 37:53.560
three weeks
after Peter was killed,

37:53.720 --> 37:55.520
when Peter's body
had already been dumped.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.600
When did you leave
the restaurant, the night

37:59.760 --> 38:01.400
before you reported
your husband missing?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.520
It was well
after 11:00, closer to 12:00.

38:05.680 --> 38:09.760
And yet you paid the
bill not long after ten o'clock.

38:09.920 --> 38:13.240
I... hung around,
chatted to staff,

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
had another drink.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.920
Mila McCarthy told us what
really happened

38:17.080 --> 38:18.560
that Thursday night.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.920
Did she tell you
she killed Peter?

38:25.680 --> 38:28.680
They'd been having an affair.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.520
He told her he was
leaving, and she killed him.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.640
Really?

38:33.800 --> 38:36.840
And you've been covering
for her all this time?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.440
Why would you do that?

38:43.680 --> 38:45.200
We're searching your house.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.200
The forensic
team have found blood

38:49.360 --> 38:51.880
and tissue matter in
your bathroom.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.080
We're assuming both
belong to your husband,

38:54.240 --> 38:56.320
but the lab will confirm that.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.360
[Billie]We also found
fragments of glass,

39:01.520 --> 39:03.960
consistent with someone breaking
a mirror with great force.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.840
Can you show me
your hands, Dr. Hodges?

39:17.040 --> 39:18.600
I can see healing
cuts on your hands.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.520
How did you get those?

39:30.320 --> 39:34.120
I hit him with the mirror.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.240
So, you admit
that you killed Peter.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.840
Yes.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.760
Was Mila McCarthy involved?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.440
No.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.360
Whose idea was it to
say that she saw Peter leaving?

39:53.840 --> 39:55.400
Mine.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.520
It worked. Until your
husband's body was found.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.400
By the way, when
did you find the scanner?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.120
A couple of weeks after.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.320
Once I'd worked
out what it was for,

40:07.480 --> 40:10.320
I realized that is how
Peter was stealing cars,

40:10.480 --> 40:12.360
after everything
I had done to get

40:12.520 --> 40:15.720
him on the straight and narrow.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.120
Not such a trusting
relationship after all.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.600
Charlie Hill did his
best to destroy my marriage,

40:22.760 --> 40:24.200
and as for Mila McCarthy,

40:24.360 --> 40:28.360
having sex with my
husband in my house.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.440
You blackmailed her,

40:30.600 --> 40:32.800
and you made her move
your husband's body with you.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.520
Will she be charged
as an accessory?

40:39.680 --> 40:41.920
The Crown
Prosecution Service has

40:42.080 --> 40:43.400
authorized charges against her.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.560
Then today hasn't been all bad.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.000
[grunts]

41:27.720 --> 41:28.800
Boss...

41:28.960 --> 41:29.920
[breathing heavily]

41:30.080 --> 41:32.680
we got a problem.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.320
You were right
about coercive control.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.040
-Good instincts.
-Thanks.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.400
-Rob said something earlier.
-What?

41:41.560 --> 41:44.920
He said you were
married to the Chief Super.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.720
What about it?

41:46.880 --> 41:49.960
You told me you didn't
even know Mr. Mulgrew.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.280
Sorry about that. I was lying.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.680
We've just charged
Cassidy Hodges with murder.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.640
-What's happened?
-Chief Superintendent Mulgrew.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.600
I'm sorry, he gave me the slip.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.960
He cracked Rob with a golf club.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.320
Are you alright?

42:07.480 --> 42:10.000
I'm fine, just
feel a bit stupid.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.400
There he is.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.600
He clearly changed
his mind about giving evidence.

42:17.760 --> 42:20.000
Where would he go,
Vivienne? Out of the country?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.760
Possibly.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.280
He'd need his passport.
Would he risk going home?

42:25.440 --> 42:28.280
When we were married, he hid
things in his locker at the gym.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.880
Harrowfield Gym.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.080
Same one I got to.
I've seen him in there.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.560
-Billie, you're with me.
-Yeah.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.000
Rob, line up urgent
cell site for Mulgrew.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.840
[Rob]On it.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.440
How could he be so reckless?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.840
I want you to stay here.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.040
That is an order, Sergeant.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.560
[intense music]

43:08.240 --> 43:09.200
[receptionist]Can I help you?

43:09.360 --> 43:11.200
Police. We need
access to the men's

43:11.360 --> 43:13.240
changing area and
one of the lockers.

43:13.400 --> 43:14.640
Down there.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.560
[cellphone vibrating]

43:27.480 --> 43:29.560
Where are you?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.360
Don't panic, I'm on my way.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.920
His locker's empty.
We've missed him.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.360
Vivienne, you were
right. Mulgrew came here,

44:13.520 --> 44:15.040
but we don't know
where he is now.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.080
He's here.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.200
He's with me.

44:30.440 --> 44:31.840
He's dead.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.280
[theme music]
