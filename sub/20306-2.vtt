NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.878 --> 00:07.132
Stan Jablonski never cold-cocked no woman.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.258
Tomorrow, Celestine Grey

00:08.341 --> 00:12.178
will be the fourth execution in the state
since August 1983.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.306
If Tony had used this, he wouldn't be dead
and you wouldn't have this job.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.725
I'm looking for Sergeant Bates.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.643
Sergeant Bates is back on the streets.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.979
Oh, well,
I'm with the Victims' Aid Bureau.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.773
I really can't remember
the license number. It, uh...

00:23.857 --> 00:24.983
It was metallic blue.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.276
It was gray.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.154
-LUCY: It was gray.
-We're from out of town.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.281
MAN: We don't have to mince words, Rikers.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.324
You talking smack, soda, what?

00:33.408 --> 00:35.201
GERALD: It's all over! It's dead meat!

00:35.452 --> 00:36.870
They're gonna fry me, lady!

00:36.953 --> 00:38.830
JOYCE (on phone):
<i>Frank, I'm just leaving Harrisville.</i>

00:38.913 --> 00:40.874
-Could I come over?
<i>-Sure. I'd like that.</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:43.918
PHIL: Item seven.

00:44.335 --> 00:47.088
Unless there's some of your
last-minute legal technicalities,

00:47.172 --> 00:48.923
2205 hours this evening,

00:49.007 --> 00:53.219
Celestine Grey pays the ultimate penalty
at Harrisville State Prison.

00:53.803 --> 00:54.929
As arresting precinct,

00:55.013 --> 00:57.474
we may or we may not,
in the course of the day,

00:57.557 --> 01:00.477
be subject to citizens
and press individuals

01:00.560 --> 01:04.731
exercising their First Amendment rights
concerning this event.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.484
Hey, Sarge,
is the execution gonna be on TV?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.652
Sure, LaRue,
they're gonna run instant replays

01:09.736 --> 01:11.696
-on the 11 o'clock news.
-(scoffs)

01:12.530 --> 01:16.534
Our undercover at the Hotel Stratford
is established. We're in as fences.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.746
Also got, uh, the wheels turning
on a major drug buy.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.873
Best case,
we're gonna clean out the attic,

01:21.956 --> 01:24.375
maybe pop a few absentee landlords.

01:24.459 --> 01:28.213
Detectives LaRue, Washington,
Belker, Garibaldi, and Mayo,

01:28.296 --> 01:30.590
-Lieutenant Calletano are working.
-(papers rustle)

01:30.673 --> 01:32.092
Oh, item nine.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.470
You'll note on the board downstairs

01:35.553 --> 01:40.100
a list of appointments
for patrol-car pesticide wash-downs.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.351
Hey, that stuff stinks.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.520
This is not optional.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.315
A unit out of South Ferry
jumped a sidewalk last week,

01:47.398 --> 01:49.317
cleaned out a chandelier establishment.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.279
Involved officers wrote up
the cause as "pest distraction."

01:53.696 --> 01:55.615
A two-inch silverfish
went up a guy's nose.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.492
(laughter)

01:58.535 --> 01:59.661
Final note.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.874
Congratulations to Officer Renko
on the birth of a brand-new baby daughter!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.210
(cheering and applauding)

02:07.293 --> 02:10.922
Seven pounds, four ounces
at Mother of Mercy Hospital.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.174
Mama and baby are doing just fine,

02:13.258 --> 02:16.427
and papa's busted schnoz
ought to mend in a week or two.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.138
It looks like me and you
went a couple rounds

02:18.221 --> 02:20.014
with Sugar Ray Leonard, don't it, Sarge?

02:20.098 --> 02:21.474
I don't take your reference.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.101
My beak and your eyeball.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.435
Your face and my rear end!

02:24.519 --> 02:26.938
ALL: Ooh.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.858
Lieutenant Harboth and me are quits.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.359
(silence)

02:31.442 --> 02:32.443
Okay, let's get out there.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.155
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.407
(chattering)

02:37.824 --> 02:40.201
I don't understand why...

02:40.285 --> 02:41.744
I'd say he's got a point.

02:42.162 --> 02:46.541
Um, um, Officer Coffey!
Coff, can I see you for a second?

02:46.624 --> 02:49.294
(chattering continues)

02:50.461 --> 02:52.839
Your personnel update
for your sergeant's application.

02:52.922 --> 02:53.756
Is that right?

02:54.591 --> 02:57.135
Last name, Coffey, first name, Josephine,

02:57.510 --> 02:59.512
sex, female, race, Black.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.515
Hey, I was just
having a little fun, Sarge.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.100
Trying to improve the odds a little bit.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.269
But you're not Black. You're not a woman.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.520
Right.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.813
So this is wrong.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.731
Yeah.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.109
Jablonski's no fanatic
for Affirmative Action, officer,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.236
but this here's only
gonna buy you a jackpot.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.280
-I'll do it over.
-Why don't you do it over?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.535
Oh, Andy, she's beautiful!

03:22.619 --> 03:24.954
Look at that, just like her mama.
See the little fat cheeks?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.123
She's gonna have an innie, too, I think.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.625
-Captain.
-Andy...

03:29.584 --> 03:30.710
she's a knockout.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.212
So is your nose.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.214
-Natalie.
-Yeah?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.090
Where is Mr. Schnitz
with my reading material?

03:36.174 --> 03:39.010
Oh, the prince.
The prince has not yet arrived.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.929
The prince has not yet arrived.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.263
-Good morning, Captain.
-Good morning.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.767
Very persuasive, Mayo.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.101
HENRY: I've had enough of you, Renko!

03:47.185 --> 03:48.728
Easy, lieutenant! Lieutenant.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.813
I'm just trying to point out
this here execution--

03:50.897 --> 03:52.690
I'm telling you I don't wanna hear it.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.692
FRANK: Henry. Henry.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.319
You know, there's something foul
in this station house.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.905
I'm getting outta here.
Let's get out of this damn place.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.783
(phone ringing)

04:05.536 --> 04:07.205
(sighs) What's the matter, Henry?

04:08.706 --> 04:09.749
(sighs) Rachel.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.876
My kid's asleep in the next room.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.419
What happened?

04:15.004 --> 04:17.882
Four o'clock this morning
she was attacked, raped.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.345
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:22.679 --> 04:24.430
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:28.476
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:28.559 --> 04:29.936
(sirens wailing)

04:35.400 --> 04:38.027
(theme music playing)

05:53.728 --> 05:55.480
-JOYCE: Hi.
-Hi.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.814
What's Henry upset about?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.150
-How do you feel?
-Tired.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.902
-Happy we talked.
-So am I.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.487
Would you give that to Neal, please?

06:02.570 --> 06:03.696
I'm almost embarrassed.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.032
The clock's running on Celestine Grey,

06:06.115 --> 06:08.034
and I'm happier than I've been
in four months.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.369
Where does it stand?

06:09.994 --> 06:11.913
The governor's aid's ducking my call.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.874
Jerry Fuchs' man is trying to run down
the Supreme Court justice

06:14.957 --> 06:16.542
who takes appeals from our district.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.668
Is he getting warm?

06:17.752 --> 06:20.088
The justice is mountain-climbing
in New Hampshire.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.758
Jerry's man feels that he's somewhere
in the western part of the state.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.011
Frank, I could use uninterrupted
access to a phone.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.805
Dial away.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.640
I'll reimburse.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.934
Central Accounting still hasn't
figured out how to bill.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.395
-IRWIN: Frank.
-Uh, just two minutes, please.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.312
I'm due in court.

06:36.396 --> 06:40.149
Frank, am I wrong,
or was my office not told yesterday

06:40.233 --> 06:42.902
to prepare for large-scale
junkie busts this a.m.?

06:42.985 --> 06:44.570
-Yes.
-Yes, we were.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.114
We were asked to allocate manpower

06:46.197 --> 06:48.408
to process those arrests
and to obtain warrants

06:48.491 --> 06:50.576
based on some absentee landlords.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.830
Irwin, the possibility
of a large-scale drug buy

06:53.913 --> 06:54.997
came up all of a sudden.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.000
It was too tempting
for LaRue and Washington to pass up.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.877
We're delaying the other operation

06:59.961 --> 07:01.462
so as not to jeopardize
their undercover work.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.881
I took guys off two ongoings
to move on this, Frank.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.926
Well, keep 'em on. The buy may come
as early as this afternoon.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.595
We'll bust the junkies
and the landlords right after.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.222
(sighs)

07:11.931 --> 07:13.850
-Better coordination.
-Better coordination.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.144
Oh, excuse me, sir.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.062
I wanted to ask you about a situation

07:18.146 --> 07:20.148
where a dead body
is heaved out of a window.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.691
Uh, call me later, Detective.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.277
But, I mean, wouldn't that
be some sort of a crime?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.362
Uh, I'd need the details.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.448
You know when Sid will be back?

07:29.615 --> 07:33.369
Would you ask him to call me,
please, as soon as he can? It's important.

07:34.036 --> 07:34.871
Thank you.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.012
How's Rachel?

07:53.514 --> 07:54.348
The kids?

07:56.392 --> 07:57.810
They don't even know it happened.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.687
He had a knife.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.815
He said he'd kill her and them
if she made a sound.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.485
Who's handling it at Midtown?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.111
-Nobody.
-What do you mean?

08:07.195 --> 08:09.071
Nobody's handling it.
She won't file a report.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.656
That's just a first reaction.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.452
(sighs) She says she won't
go through the legal wringer.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.913
Says she's been assaulted enough.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.583
No assignments today, okay?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.001
Any way you want it.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.343
(police siren wails)

08:40.144 --> 08:42.522
-How are you?
-I'm all right. How are you?

08:43.272 --> 08:44.690
We're the Fimpels. Any messages?

08:45.274 --> 08:46.192
None today.

08:46.943 --> 08:47.777
Dave.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.655
Oh, just one second, hon.
I'll be right with you.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.615
We have some errands to run,
then we'll be leaving.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.618
-What's your check-out time?
-Approximately 1:00.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.499
Oh, well, we should be out
long before then.

09:01.582 --> 09:02.542
That's fine.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.501
-Dave.
-Yeah.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.628
That large person was wearing my dress.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.505
-Pretty color.
-Not the same style, Dave.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.174
One of my actual dresses
that was stolen yesterday.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.343
Your guy understands
this is just to get acquainted.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.553
He wants it that way, too.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.931
Okay, he samples my product,
I look at his presidents' collection.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.558
See you upstairs at 11:00.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.145
Man, it's gonna be a real
pleasure putting that dude away.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.772
Lower your voice.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.110
Neal, what's that about
water seeking its own level?

09:29.193 --> 09:30.486
(chuckles)

09:30.570 --> 09:31.821
(rattles)

09:36.659 --> 09:40.037
A child, Robert, a beautiful little child,

09:40.121 --> 09:41.956
a sweet little child.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.500
-She's mighty cute.
-Mm-hmm.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.212
It puts everything in perspective, Robert.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.758
Sergeants can yell at you
for no apparent reason,

09:52.842 --> 09:56.137
lieutenants can manhandle you
in the corridors and--

09:56.220 --> 09:58.347
Nice to see you
in a good mood again, Renko.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.515
(thuds)

09:59.599 --> 10:01.892
-On the other hand...
-Mm-hmm.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.936
...maturity is yet one more argument for--

10:04.020 --> 10:05.396
-(horn honks)
-Preach it.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.690
Homicide detectives, Robert,

10:07.773 --> 10:10.026
-they work in suits and ties.
-Yes, they do.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.194
They enter scenes of violence
after the fact.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.405
They work in safety.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.073
-Safety?
-Safety.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.992
(chuckles) Where are you gonna find
a safe place?

10:18.075 --> 10:19.827
You busted up your nose
in a maternity ward!

10:19.910 --> 10:22.163
WOMAN (over radio):<i> Unit 2202, respond.</i>

10:22.246 --> 10:23.623
2202.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.667
<i>Domestic disturbance,</i>
<i>1706 Hurdle, Apartment 3.</i>

10:26.751 --> 10:29.086
2202, copy. 1706 Hurdle.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.172
-Got it.
-(police siren wails)

10:31.255 --> 10:32.882
A little more rapid there, Renko.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.593
This speed is prudent.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.847
-(crashes)
-MAN: You're asking for it now, bitch!

10:40.431 --> 10:42.058
I'm gonna smack you.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.935
-Yeah, you and everybody else!
-(knocks on door)

10:45.019 --> 10:47.021
Police officers!
Open up the door, Mr. Turner!

10:47.104 --> 10:48.105
MAN: Get back over here!

10:48.314 --> 10:50.024
The man's allegedly dusted, Robert.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.360
(crashes)

10:52.443 --> 10:54.111
-Open up!
-MAN: Open up the damn door.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.446
(door opens)

10:58.949 --> 11:00.785
Jermaine says go away.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.204
Nobody's going anywhere, ma'am.
Are you okay?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.540
-You better go. (screams)
-JERMAINE: Bitch!

11:07.249 --> 11:10.002
-Open up the door, Mrs. Turner!
-JERMAINE: Beat it, man!

11:10.419 --> 11:12.338
-Do you wanna kick it?
-No, sir, I do not.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.800
(door crashes)

11:15.883 --> 11:16.759
JERMAINE: I'll kill her!

11:17.551 --> 11:18.928
You just take it easy there, pal.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.305
I mean it, man. Get out!

11:22.098 --> 11:23.265
Let's get out of here, Renko.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.977
All right, we're gonna go
and reconsider this, okay, buddy?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.730
You think I'm kidding? Huh?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.649
(gunfire)

11:33.025 --> 11:35.027
JERMAINE: Get out of here! Get out!!

11:35.778 --> 11:36.654
(bangs)

11:36.737 --> 11:39.281
2202, a 10-13, 1706 Hurdle.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.908
WOMAN (over radio):<i> Copy, 2202.</i>

11:41.492 --> 11:43.035
-You all right?
-(sobs)

11:43.119 --> 11:45.162
I think I just refractured my snooter.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.208
RENKO: This freak is definitely nuts,
probably dusted.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.210
Got a long rifle, has a handgun up there--

11:51.293 --> 11:52.503
Excuse me just a moment.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.630
Ballantine, would you please
get the press corps

11:54.714 --> 11:56.006
the hell behind our van?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.884
Folks, we need you to stay
to the rear of this vehicle.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.553
Now come on. Let's go.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.765
(gunfire)

12:04.849 --> 12:06.350
RENKO: What'd I tell you?

12:06.434 --> 12:08.269
-Do we have full evacuation?
-Everybody's out.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.272
Mullins was hit by a ricochet, Lieutenant.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.315
Is he all right?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.900
Oh, it's a flesh wound
to the upper right arm.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.527
-He seems okay.
-Oh, Judas.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.112
Is it your sense
that this woman is at risk?

12:18.195 --> 12:20.614
She was beat up pretty badly.
He looked crazy enough to do anything.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.324
-And he's refused to communicate?
-Yeah.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.410
Well, I'm not inclined to waltz with him.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.663
Prepare to deliver CS.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.290
(trigger clicks)

12:29.373 --> 12:30.791
MAN (over radio):<i> C.S. ready, sir.</i>

12:31.876 --> 12:33.335
Support units trained on the window?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.338
<i>Trained and ready, sir.</i>

12:36.422 --> 12:37.339
Don't do it!

12:37.423 --> 12:38.966
Ready? Go.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.135
-(gunshot)
-(glass breaks)

12:41.218 --> 12:43.262
(gunfire)

12:43.345 --> 12:44.555
He's trapped.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.974
All right, support units, fire.
Take him out.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.351
(gunfire continues)

12:50.936 --> 12:52.813
-(gunshot)
-Cease fire.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.065
Got you, you son of a bitch!

12:55.983 --> 12:58.986
(helicopter blade whirs)

13:02.656 --> 13:05.451
(police siren wailing)

13:12.208 --> 13:13.292
I appreciate this, Sid.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.170
I'll get another day off
next week, Lieutenant.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.765
Just tell me, Lieutenant,
someone comes home,

13:28.015 --> 13:30.059
are we leaving
through the door or the window?

13:30.392 --> 13:33.562
It's my ex-wife's apartment.
She was attacked and won't press charges.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.189
<i>Basta.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:46.742
(suitcase clicks)

14:16.522 --> 14:17.439
Whoa.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.359
If this guy's on file, he's popped.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.364
We're talking some pressure.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.909
You won't demonstrate the other hand.
The other hand was holding a knife.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.503
Josephine Coffey, really dumb.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.755
I'm gonna tell you something, Luce,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.300
I'm off the list saying
the guy's a bing-bong.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.468
He may not be a bing-bong.
I think he's a jerk.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.014
Hey, he could have ranted and raved,
which would have just got my back up.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.515
He could have put it in your jacket.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.766
Yeah, but what does he do?

14:53.309 --> 14:56.645
He calmly points out,
in a completely nonjudgmental way,

14:57.646 --> 14:59.940
"You are not Black. You are not a woman."

15:01.859 --> 15:04.361
I'm telling you,
I think the guy may be a genius.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.781
WOMAN (over radio):<i> Unit 2203,</i>
<i>robbery reported. 113 North Fisher.</i>

15:07.865 --> 15:09.909
-Unit 2203 responding.
-(police siren wailing)

15:09.992 --> 15:13.621
(people shouting)

15:13.704 --> 15:16.165
MAN: Eighty bucks is not easy
to come by! I need my money!

15:16.248 --> 15:18.542
MAN 2: This is your fault, man!
Just save it!

15:18.626 --> 15:21.128
(shouting indistinctly)

15:21.503 --> 15:23.130
-COFFEY: What's going on?
-(shouting continues)

15:23.213 --> 15:24.298
LUCY: Hold it down!

15:24.381 --> 15:25.299
A thief comes here,

15:25.382 --> 15:27.092
so this turkey clerk
just slams down the window,

15:27.176 --> 15:28.719
so the guy robs all of us!

15:28.802 --> 15:29.970
I'll take you out, you jerk!

15:30.054 --> 15:32.598
-Hey, take it easy now. Just take it easy.
-Oh, boy.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.725
Hello, officers.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.894
They're the people from yesterday.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.562
You're the Fimpels, right?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.231
We were robbed again.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.734
I mean, it's the second time
it happened, you know?

15:43.817 --> 15:47.321
This has been the worst
experience of our lives!

15:47.404 --> 15:49.114
(chattering)

15:49.198 --> 15:50.950
FEMALE REPORTER<i>: Hear in the background,</i>
<i>as Turner falls,</i>

15:51.033 --> 15:53.535
<i>an EATER marksman adds</i>
<i>a footnote to the incident.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:55.579
<i>Got you, you son of a bitch!</i>

15:55.913 --> 15:57.623
It looks as if we executed him.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.751
I saw no culpable
behavior out there, Frank.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.879
The man had a hostage,
he was laying down deadly fire,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.422
an officer had been wounded.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.424
Yeah, but there's one spot...

16:07.508 --> 16:10.552
-(clicks)
-There. Right there.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.846
Now there, he looks completely defenseless

16:12.930 --> 16:14.431
and as if Foster shoots him in cold blood.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.141
-(gunshot)
-It's an illusion, Frank.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.269
It makes it seem like more time
has elapsed than actually did.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.437
He dropped his weapon.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.941
Are you asking me if I thought
the man came up slowly, Frank?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.109
The answer is yes.

16:25.693 --> 16:30.072
Do I wish he hadn't shouted what he did
after the man fell? (chuckles)

16:30.155 --> 16:32.282
Would I prefer not having
23-year-olds in my unit?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.201
Yes on both counts.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.246
But the fact is, up to that point,
I had given no cease-fire order.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.414
(knock on door)

16:40.833 --> 16:43.335
They, uh, get that stuff
on the air real quick,

16:43.419 --> 16:44.670
-don't they, sir?
-(telephone rings)

16:44.753 --> 16:48.215
It's pretty dramatic footage.
TV stations are making the most of it.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.135
-Furillo.
-It's all over the place.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.262
FRANK: Howard Hunter's
briefing me right now, sir.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.430
<i>Got you, you son of a bitch!</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:56.140
He says it's very misleading.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.684
FEMALE REPORTER:
<i>...that final shot knocked him back.</i>

16:58.767 --> 17:00.227
Yeah, they've already phoned.
They're on their way up.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.854
<i>...shooting has caused</i>
<i>considerable controversy.</i>

17:01.937 --> 17:04.189
Uh-huh. Yes, sir.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.819
<i>The 23-year-old officer</i>
<i>from the Hill Street precinct that shot...</i>

17:09.945 --> 17:11.864
Internal Affairs is on
its way up to interview you.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.159
Any weapons discharged,
that's standard procedure.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.078
Okay, but let's at least
acknowledge that the tapes exist

17:18.162 --> 17:20.706
and that they appear to show
questionable conduct.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.250
I'd urge you to be prepared
for a rigorous interrogation.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.753
We're not gonna have an electronics
lynching here, are we, Captain?

17:27.921 --> 17:30.007
Would you excuse us for a minute, Foster?

17:30.090 --> 17:31.175
Uh, yes, sir.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.515
What the hell's
the matter with you, Howard?

17:38.599 --> 17:41.018
Well, we don't exactly seem to
be closing ranks behind our man.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.854
Nobody's gonna lynch Foster,
and nobody's gonna sell him out.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.148
But there's also gonna be
no stonewalling here.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.609
At minimum, what I hear
between the lines from you

17:48.692 --> 17:50.736
is that his behavior was problematic.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.739
Which is no justification
for a media crucifixion.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.700
That's a separate problem.
Let's establish what the man did!

17:58.452 --> 17:59.661
I'll write up my statement.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.038
I think that's a good idea.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.172
(telephone ringing)

18:10.714 --> 18:12.382
A couple of visitor's passes, please.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.135
Rachel, there's more to it than that.
I didn't break into your room.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.096
-(dial tone)
-Rachel.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.099
JOYCE: Of course not for clemency,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.768
but did you say cautious
optimism and a short stay?

18:23.894 --> 18:26.396
Yeah. Let me ask you
a question, Mr. Larson.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.066
Did you even bring up Celestine's case
with the governor?

18:30.984 --> 18:33.320
I know you have to look
at the large canvas.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.364
Thanks for your efforts.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.991
"N.G," Ms. Davenport?

18:38.867 --> 18:40.410
"N.G" with the governor.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.288
Hey, believe me, my Manchester
guy's gonna find this justice.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.582
He knows New Hampshire
like the back of his hand.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.168
Meanwhile, how about we open up
a second front?

18:48.252 --> 18:49.169
Namely?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.964
How about a guy having pizza
with Celestine Grey

18:52.548 --> 18:55.342
halfway across the city
when the sister was attacked?

18:55.676 --> 18:57.594
-What's his name?
-Sonny Franks.

18:58.387 --> 19:02.099
-Why didn't he come forward before this?
-No one gave him 500 bucks before.

19:02.891 --> 19:06.728
-That's suborning perjury, Mr. Fuchs.
-Come on, call me Jerry.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.022
What would be criminal, Ms. Davenport,

19:09.106 --> 19:12.693
if I didn't report to you every single
possibility my operatives uncover.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.737
Besides which, we'll take a whole day
to knock the story down.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.741
I take that as a no?
We stay on the one front?

19:20.325 --> 19:21.410
Just the one front.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.166
You got a problem, Sergeant?

19:27.875 --> 19:29.751
I thought you used to be
a pretty good cop.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.217
MAN: Well, get ready.
You won't believe this fix.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.635
Sara and I were robbed again.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
Uh, I'm wondering if I can complete

19:40.387 --> 19:42.472
these people's robbery report now,
Mrs. Furillo.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.016
-Sergeant.
-Every cent you wired us.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.643
This man is making
an emergency phone call,

19:46.727 --> 19:49.730
and I've got to call my office to clear
putting them up for another night.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.523
No, we didn't even get out
of the telegraph office!

19:51.607 --> 19:53.901
So I'm afraid you're gonna have
to be satisfied with waiting

19:53.984 --> 19:55.027
until I'm done with them.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.112
Well, we didn't ask to get robbed, Dennis!

19:57.196 --> 20:01.116
Or maybe you'd like to give me
a little pop in the kazoo, huh?

20:01.366 --> 20:02.201
Come on, slugger!

20:02.284 --> 20:03.535
Look, I'm not exactly
in the mood for a lecture.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.038
I'm not exactly positive
of what you're referring to,

20:06.121 --> 20:08.415
but (chuckles) sure, sure.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.709
Ladies first, Mrs. Furillo.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.128
All right. Yeah, all right.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.257
A little pop in the snootsky
wouldn't do her no harm.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.801
Yeah, I said all right, Dennis!

20:20.719 --> 20:21.970
Best to Betsy.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.348
(telephone thuds)

20:25.307 --> 20:27.559
Dennis says they're at their credit limit.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.394
How about my father?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.480
Yeah, that's a good idea.
You wanna call him?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.315
Listen, I'm pretty sure

20:33.398 --> 20:36.068
we could get you extended
at the hotel another night.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.154
Well, I'm sorry. It's the best I can do.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.699
Okay, but I'm not setting foot
out of that room

20:42.783 --> 20:44.284
until we go to pick up the money.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.286
Plus, I want a police escort.

20:47.871 --> 20:52.292
MAN: Young fella don't got no remembering
of the way this place used to be.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.169
It's a dump now!

20:54.878 --> 20:56.296
Them elevators...

20:57.130 --> 20:59.383
they relieve themselves in there.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.512
Junkies... (sniffs)

21:03.595 --> 21:05.764
Peeing. Ugh!

21:05.847 --> 21:07.557
(telephone rings)

21:08.725 --> 21:09.726
Switchboard.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.521
Yeah.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.066
Yes. Thank you.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.276
MAN: Look at you.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.364
And look at this fella!

21:23.740 --> 21:24.741
Alley Cat.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.077
Hey, did you relieve yourself in there?

21:27.160 --> 21:30.622
MICK: I have a male Cauc, 5'7",
brown hair, maroon shirt, black pants.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.708
Cauc may have seen some
surveillance equipment--

21:32.791 --> 21:35.043
Fella may have relieved himself in there.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.336
Shh!

21:36.420 --> 21:37.671
Alley Cat, copy.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.886
Who are you talking to there?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.638
Nothing. It's a ham radio.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.973
Well, good for you.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.351
Hobby keeps you out of trouble. (chuckles)

21:51.435 --> 21:53.645
-Mike, I'll be in room 306.
-Right.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.355
Yes, sir!

21:55.772 --> 21:57.065
Eat poison and die.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.443
Hiya, big time.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.236
-Hey, sport.
-I have no time to party.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.321
Police! You're under arrest.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.197
-For what?!
-Dealing stolen property.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.700
Aw, come on. Wait!
At least let me talk first, huh?

22:09.119 --> 22:10.245
Sorry I'm a little late, Ray.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.955
You manage a hotel,
your schedule's not your own.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.459
Yeah, it can't be any picnic keeping up
a swell joint like this.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.544
You bring the stuff, Mr. Rikers?

22:17.627 --> 22:19.880
As soon as I see a Polaroid
with you and some currency.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.382
Please.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.010
Nice likeness.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.855
I like that you don't sample it, Ray.
Wise man.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.487
Is that sweet?
Is that maraschino cherry or what?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.906
Very good. (inhales sharply)

22:48.533 --> 22:51.787
-Four kilos?
-Correcto. I need 125 units.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.080
That's acceptable.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.749
Bing-bang. Don't shoot a cabbage twice,
do you, my friend?

22:56.500 --> 22:59.586
Four o'clock here good for the transfer?
My place, your people.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.464
-Four o'clock.
-(speaks Spanish)

23:09.930 --> 23:11.723
Henry, why are you doing this to me?

23:11.807 --> 23:13.767
Because pretending
that something did not happen

23:13.850 --> 23:15.227
is not gonna make it go away.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.813
Don't you lecture me! Don't you dare!

23:17.896 --> 23:19.689
I know exactly what happened.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.691
A man came into my bedroom.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.318
He put a knife to my throat,

23:23.652 --> 23:26.696
and he threatened to kill our children
unless I had sex with him.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.615
Now, do you want to know
exactly what he made me do?

23:28.698 --> 23:29.574
No.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.745
I will not let that animal violate my life
any more than he already has.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.837
What about the next woman he rapes?
And the one after that?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.713
Don't put that guilt on me.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.968
I have children, a job,
a man who cares about me.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.388
I won't let what happened to me
become the topic of snide gossip.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.933
We know who the guy is.
You can put him away, for God's sake!

23:55.016 --> 23:56.810
Let someone else be a hero.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.854
You do the right thing now,

23:59.271 --> 24:01.189
there doesn't have to be someone else.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.276
Maybe, if I'd still had
a husband in bed beside me,

24:04.359 --> 24:05.485
this never would have happened!

24:06.987 --> 24:08.321
(sighing) Oh, boy.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.119
No, please. (sniffles)

24:15.412 --> 24:17.122
Please, just leave me alone.

24:18.498 --> 24:19.583
(crying)

24:47.027 --> 24:48.904
Completed our on-site witness
statements, Captain,

24:48.987 --> 24:50.447
EATER and civilian.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.615
(door closes)

24:51.990 --> 24:52.949
How does it look?

24:53.033 --> 24:55.410
Two questionable aspects
in the cop's behavior.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.913
He may have fired late,
and the shouting was inflammatory.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.789
Regarding the first, all statements agree,

24:59.873 --> 25:02.417
no one discharged his weapon
after the cease-fire was given.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.962
Regard to the second,
no indication Foster's shouting

25:06.046 --> 25:08.298
-substantially affected the incident.
-So you're gonna clear?

25:10.133 --> 25:12.344
Ballistics and forensic reports
will take three to four days.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.723
Uh, Foster doesn't have
three or four days.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.642
Lieutenant Hunter's
concerned about the effect

25:18.725 --> 25:20.143
the television tapes might have.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.687
There's really no way
to issue any faster, sir.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.356
I also want to say that, uh,

25:25.607 --> 25:27.067
even though he's not guilty
of any wrongdoing,

25:27.150 --> 25:30.487
I think the cop showed
a very poor situational response.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.782
FRANK Thanks very much for moving so fast.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.452
(sighs) Thanks
for your cooperation, Lieutenant.

25:39.579 --> 25:40.622
(door opens)

25:42.916 --> 25:44.376
Well, Officer Foster,

25:44.709 --> 25:47.337
bend over and kiss your butt goodbye.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.507
Let him know the preliminary findings.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.551
Cold comfort for a man
who's about to endure

25:52.634 --> 25:54.928
press vilification that'll
damage the rest of his life.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.180
Well, I'm gonna do my best
to minimize that, Howard,

25:57.264 --> 26:00.183
but we can't shield Foster
from the fact that his conduct stank.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.602
It's either gonna bust him,
or he's gonna get over it.

26:02.686 --> 26:03.520
Yeah.

26:11.861 --> 26:12.696
Hi.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.283
The justice refused the stay.

26:17.325 --> 26:18.952
Does that exhaust Grey's options?

26:19.536 --> 26:22.247
This was his last chance.
He's going to be executed.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.001
I feel like it's my fault.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.628
That's crazy. You've been a bearcat.

26:29.796 --> 26:30.922
He killed that woman.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.092
If anyone deserves executing,
probably he does.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.054
But at that arraignment two years ago,

26:38.138 --> 26:41.516
Celestine Grey could have had
the same deal Gerald Chapman got.

26:41.933 --> 26:45.729
If I'd been less busy fuming at you
and busier being his advocate,

26:45.812 --> 26:47.647
he could have been
the one to roll and plead.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.817
-Joyce...
-No, it's the truth, Frank.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.445
(sighs) And I've got to live with it.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.991
Would you drive up with me?

27:00.076 --> 27:02.162
I'm an invited guest to this.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.079
Yes.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.332
Ms. Davenport, would you
supervise an intake interview?

27:05.415 --> 27:08.084
-We got a pretty agitated guy.
-Sure.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.712
(telephone ringing)

27:11.504 --> 27:13.089
(chattering)

27:16.092 --> 27:17.052
Mr. Hanley.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.015
Captain, I'm still working on my story.

27:22.098 --> 27:25.852
Are you aware that the Supreme Court
turned down Grey's last appeal?

27:26.686 --> 27:27.604
Surprised?

27:27.854 --> 27:29.814
No comment.
May I talk to you for a minute?

27:37.155 --> 27:38.823
Close it for me, would you please?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.993
I want you to write a story on Ed Foster.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.620
Ed "Got you, you son of a bitch" Foster?

27:43.703 --> 27:45.830
That's the headline, not the story.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.999
There's no malice in Foster.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.877
He's a decent young man
who may make a decent cop.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.629
Did you say a story or a PR piece?

27:52.879 --> 27:53.963
A story.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.091
On those, I form
my own impressions, Captain.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.717
I hope those impressions include

27:57.801 --> 28:00.929
how it can ruin a young cop's life
to have the cameras rolling

28:01.012 --> 28:03.223
when he shouts the wrong thing
in the heat of the moment.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.935
Am I hearing Foster's been cleared
of everything but bad language?

28:07.018 --> 28:08.269
It's not for attribution.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.979
But off the record,
that's how it lays out?

28:10.063 --> 28:11.064
That's how it lays out.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.441
He's been cleared by EATER
as well as civilian witnesses.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.361
-How can I use it?
-Just quote a department source.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.239
-This doesn't commit me to a puff piece.
-Understood.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.408
Thanks, Captain.

28:25.912 --> 28:26.996
Captain, excuse me.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.040
We got something
I think you ought to hear.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.050
My client claims to know
of officers at risk.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.136
He'll trade particulars for immunity.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.096
-You better move, too.
-Let's hear it.

28:43.847 --> 28:44.681
That good enough?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.976
Your guys at the hotel,
they're looking' at a jackpot.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.187
There's going to be a drug sale in the
room your detectives are undercover.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.273
-And?
-And it's gonna be a robbery.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.734
Rikers hired two of my buddies to bust in.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.069
I was gonna take it down a little early,

28:58.153 --> 29:00.071
then I thought I spotted
these hidden cameras.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.948
-When?
-Four o'clock.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.284
-(door opens)
-MAN: Way to wait, Toni.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.785
I couldn't get representation.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.079
-Phone Belker, then get over there.
-PATSY: On the way.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.291
Don't kill us, fellas.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.460
-Don't kill us, all right?
-MAN: Hey, lighten up.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.962
Nobody's gonna get killed
as long as everybody behaves.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.005
I don't want to die.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.631
-Can you believe this?
-Sort of.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.719
-Oh, man!
-What?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.220
-Pigs.
-Get outta here.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.930
I'm telling you,
it's both ends of the hall.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.432
-What's goon' on?
-What?

29:27.515 --> 29:29.350
-Oh, man, you're cops!
-Hey, if we were...

29:29.434 --> 29:32.687
What am I? What is this? What am I?
An unknowing go-between here?

29:32.771 --> 29:33.980
Are you kiddin' me, man?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.982
Easy, easy. Let's everyone stay calm.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.234
-All right, I'll stay calm.
-(chair crashes)

29:39.110 --> 29:41.154
You'll never make it. Don't be foolish.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.572
We're out of here, man.
We're gettin' out of here.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.033
NEAL:
Hey, you ain't gettin' no place, slick!

29:45.116 --> 29:46.868
We got cops in the hall, cops downstairs!

29:46.951 --> 29:49.287
Yeah? We got one, too, right here!

29:49.704 --> 29:51.414
MAN: We got a hostage, man! We'll off him!

29:51.498 --> 29:52.624
I'm goin' with you!

29:53.166 --> 29:55.543
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
They got Lieutenant Calletano!

29:55.627 --> 29:57.587
We got a hostage, man! We'll off him!

29:57.921 --> 29:59.798
Think, Rikers. Call it off.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.260
You'll never make the front door, Rikers.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.263
It's you! Look at you!
You pigs are all over!

30:07.347 --> 30:09.599
You're not that stupid, are you?
You don't want to die, do you?

30:09.682 --> 30:11.142
(door opens)

30:11.893 --> 30:14.270
Uh, excuse me. Uh, hi.
Could you pardon us, please?

30:14.354 --> 30:15.730
Shut your mouth!

30:24.823 --> 30:27.158
-Drop your weapons!
-Lord!

30:27.242 --> 30:28.201
You don't move, Rikers!

30:28.284 --> 30:29.953
Let's work something
out here, huh, people?

30:30.036 --> 30:31.246
Drop them!

30:31.329 --> 30:33.206
Hands goin' up! All right?

30:34.791 --> 30:36.084
No, we're okay! It's all right!

30:36.167 --> 30:38.503
Unwilling companion! Forced companion!

30:39.045 --> 30:40.129
You okay, Lieutenant?

30:40.213 --> 30:41.881
I'm all right. I'm all right.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.552
If I could only get a glass of water...
my heart is pounding.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.470
-All right, take it easy.
-All right.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.265
This is just terrible.
This is the most terrible thing.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.643
-There are those two officers again!
-Hi, folks.

30:53.726 --> 30:54.853
Officers.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.647
Do you know, Dave,
do you know what disturbs me?

30:57.730 --> 30:59.566
Do you know what disturbs me particularly?

30:59.649 --> 31:01.484
-Why don't you come over and sit down?
-Come on, sit down.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.737
Do you know what-- Do you know
what disturbs me, Dave?

31:05.071 --> 31:08.491
It's seeing that person in my dress!

31:08.575 --> 31:10.118
In addition to everything else,

31:10.201 --> 31:13.079
to have to watch my stolen dress
in front of me!

31:14.581 --> 31:17.125
Hey, they're talkin' to you, sex change!

31:17.834 --> 31:19.794
Just what is the lady's problem?

31:20.169 --> 31:23.047
I... want... my...

31:23.131 --> 31:24.632
dress back!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.802
We want our dress back, please.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.971
-Give her her dress back.
-No.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.140
Give it to her.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.601
-And just what am I supposed to wear?
-Pants!

31:34.684 --> 31:36.895
(scoffs) I'd rather die!

31:37.896 --> 31:39.314
Do you mean that?

31:41.357 --> 31:44.110
Go upstairs, Jared,
and get my yellow frock, please.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.745
In the alley! Uh, hold it!

31:53.828 --> 31:55.288
That ain't cool, man!

31:55.371 --> 31:56.581
What's your deal?

31:56.664 --> 31:58.458
-You're under arrest!
-Ah!

31:58.541 --> 32:01.127
Hey! You just bought yourself
a brutality rap, sucker!

32:01.210 --> 32:03.630
Oh, that so?
In for a penny, in for a pound.

32:03.713 --> 32:04.964
Aah!

32:05.757 --> 32:06.591
Move!

32:20.980 --> 32:22.523
Is that the knife you used, James?

32:23.066 --> 32:24.901
Is that the knife you held
to her throat while you raped her?

32:24.984 --> 32:25.818
Hey.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.153
Is this what you were gonna kill
her kids with if she resisted?

32:27.236 --> 32:29.155
I don't know what you're talkin'
about, man! I didn't do no rape!

32:29.238 --> 32:32.325
And you know what, James?
You're gonna get away with it!

32:32.408 --> 32:34.410
-(grunts)
-Ain't that somethin'?

32:34.702 --> 32:36.829
You're gonna get away with it
because she won't charge!

32:36.913 --> 32:38.498
Oh, you're crazy, man!

32:39.207 --> 32:41.417
(panting)
You got that exactly right, James.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.002
I am crazy...

32:44.003 --> 32:45.505
because that was my wife!

32:45.588 --> 32:47.131
Those were my kids in the next room!

32:47.799 --> 32:49.467
You're damn right I'm crazy, James!

32:50.468 --> 32:52.136
Go on! Go ahead!

32:53.638 --> 32:55.765
Get up! Run!

32:55.848 --> 32:56.933
I run, you'll kill me.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.894
-(trigger clicks)
-I may kill you anyway.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.648
No, man, don't kill me.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.192
No, man, please don't kill me.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.156
How does it feel, James, huh?
How does it feel to be that scared?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.116
I'm sorry, man!

33:19.247 --> 33:20.289
Get up.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.042
-(trigger clicks)
-Get up!

33:24.377 --> 33:26.129
(panting)

33:27.088 --> 33:30.049
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.385
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say

33:32.468 --> 33:34.721
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.682
You have the right to an attorney!

33:38.266 --> 33:41.227
You have the right to have your attorney
present during questioning.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.187
(telephone rings)

33:45.356 --> 33:48.484
James Fitzsimmons,
warrants on failure to appear and assault.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.029
New charges are resisting,
possession, possession with--

33:51.112 --> 33:52.280
A little slower, Lieutenant.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.157
Possession of a concealed weapon.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.950
How about a little compression,
Lieutenant?

33:56.034 --> 33:57.035
Someone will have to try all those counts.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.494
And somebody better do it!

34:00.663 --> 34:02.957
(telephone rings)

34:05.126 --> 34:06.836
You talkin' a wrong guy here, Frank?

34:08.629 --> 34:10.757
Tell Henry to throw in
his parking tickets, too.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.218
-Captain...
-You the captain?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.598
-This is the guy that owns the Stratford.
-We're physicians, Captain.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.433
That hotel is a corporate investment.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.685
How in hell would we know what
goes on there from day-to-day?

34:22.769 --> 34:23.728
No sale.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.606
We've pursued civil remedies
with you people for three years,

34:26.689 --> 34:29.067
and you've set up one corporate
roadblock after another.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.027
-Now you're gonna go away.
-I don't believe it.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.528
Take the hint. Henry.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.828
I lifted a clean print
in Rachel's apartment. He's the guy.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.455
Rachel's decided to press charges?

34:42.789 --> 34:43.748
No.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.167
What else do we have on him?

34:47.251 --> 34:50.546
Felony warrants,
he was holding when I took him,

34:50.630 --> 34:51.672
he had a switchblade.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.925
He'll go away for a while.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.387
You can't believe
how much I wanted to kill him.

34:59.013 --> 34:59.931
I can believe it.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.227
Not for deterrence, not for justice,
for vengeance.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.397
Giving me a little problem
with Celestine Grey.

35:08.481 --> 35:11.234
I know capital punishment is wrong
because I<i> feel </i>it's wrong,

35:11.526 --> 35:13.152
the Gospel according to Goldblume,

35:13.694 --> 35:14.821
always trust your heart.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.742
But if I go just with my feelings,
I got blood up to my elbows.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.538
It's a minor inconsistency.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.169
(telephone rings)

35:32.547 --> 35:34.090
(chattering)

35:34.423 --> 35:35.299
Ray...

35:36.342 --> 35:37.218
Nice job.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.178
Thank you.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.015
I have been hyperventilating
ever since I came back.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.560
Is there any particular reason
you wanted this assignment?

35:46.227 --> 35:49.730
To show that I'm still a vital
and vigorous cop.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.359
From downtown.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.030
-An invitation to early retirement.
-Oh, yeah, I got one, too.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.116
-Really?
-Sure, it's an automatic.

36:00.199 --> 36:03.703
The computer kicks it out to everyone
just before full pension vestment.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.081
I never want to go on another undercover.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.798
You goldbricking, Foster?
The watch is not over.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.093
I'm sorry, sir. I was, uh...

36:19.552 --> 36:20.386
Oh...

36:22.597 --> 36:24.724
We can fudge for 15 minutes.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.812
I understand you did an interview.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.772
-Yes, sir.
-How did it go?

36:32.523 --> 36:36.444
Uh, okay, I guess.
I mean, he seemed like an okay guy.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.905
Well, on balance,
things are looking up, huh?

36:39.864 --> 36:40.698
(exhales)

36:43.951 --> 36:45.244
My mother called before.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.832
They showed the tape in Portland.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.086
I guess they're gonna show it everywhere.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.088
I see.

36:59.967 --> 37:00.801
Yeah.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.637
She, uh, she wanted...

37:04.347 --> 37:06.766
She wanted to know
how I could ever do such a thing.

37:10.937 --> 37:11.812
Well...

37:13.481 --> 37:15.233
They want us to protect them, Foster,

37:15.316 --> 37:17.652
but they're a little squeamish
about chapter and verse.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.197
I just shouldn't have shouted.
I shouldn't have yelled what I did.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.659
Well, in a perfect world,
you wouldn't have.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.871
But you were adrenalized and afraid,
and you did shout it.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.541
What you have to decide is whether
that moment is gonna defeat you.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.710
Well, it seems like it already has.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.214
I mean, it seems like... that tape...

37:40.007 --> 37:42.301
is how people are always
gonna think about me.

37:43.177 --> 37:46.097
You're not the first to have
a moment of weakness, Foster.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.519
People can be more forgiving
than you can imagine...

37:53.562 --> 37:55.731
but you have to be able
to forgive yourself.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.902
Well... I don't know if I can.

38:01.737 --> 38:04.740
I don't know if I could after this.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.451
Come on, don't let it whip you, son.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.415
Just swallow what's bitter in the cup
and move on.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.084
Be a man.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.628
Will you please just excuse me, sir?

38:17.712 --> 38:18.796
-Ed--
-Please!

38:19.005 --> 38:22.091
Please just leave me alone.
I'll be up in a minute.

38:24.927 --> 38:25.761
Okay.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.900
-(telephone ringing)
-Ms. Davenport?

38:40.109 --> 38:41.944
Wish we could have turned
things around for you.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.279
Thanks for your efforts.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.323
That's what you hired us for.
Going up to the execution?

38:45.406 --> 38:48.409
-Yes.
-Uh, can I take 30 seconds here?

38:48.909 --> 38:50.995
I was wondering
if you could give us a report card,

38:51.078 --> 38:54.582
say if you'll be able to recommend
Fuchs Security for more work?

38:54.665 --> 38:56.709
Offering to provide perjuring witnesses

38:56.792 --> 38:59.128
is something I'd advise against
in future, Mr. Fuchs.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.547
Hey, you don't have to tell me that twice.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.674
-Frank!
-Jerry.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.302
-Uh, you goin' up to the execution?
-That's right.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.805
I admire that, Frank. You go the distance,
the full nine innings.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.392
Leo, I'm signed out
to Harrisville State Prison.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.894
Any word on Officer Mullins?

39:14.977 --> 39:16.479
He's out of recovery, sir, doing well.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.231
Uh, so you would call that
around a "B," then?

39:19.315 --> 39:20.441
Somewhere around a "B."

39:20.524 --> 39:22.818
Well, it's passing
with room for improvement.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.905
Uh, drive safely.

39:26.614 --> 39:27.907
(dog barking)

39:27.990 --> 39:29.200
HENRY: Rachel, please wait.

39:29.283 --> 39:32.286
Annie is inside and Josh
is coming home any minute.

39:32.578 --> 39:33.954
I'm not gonna say anything.

39:34.038 --> 39:34.997
ANNIE: Who's here?

39:36.624 --> 39:38.542
-RACHEL: It's Daddy.
-Hi, Daddy.

39:38.626 --> 39:39.585
Hiya, sweetheart.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.796
Yahhh.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.631
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

39:43.714 --> 39:44.799
You're a day early.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.551
Just thought I'd come by
and talk to Mom for a sec.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.345
-ANNIE: What's wrong?
-Nothing.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.180
Nothing's wrong. What's wrong with you?

39:51.472 --> 39:52.681
Just the way you sounded.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.810
Mm. You never met a grouch before?

39:56.268 --> 39:58.312
-RACHEL: Annie, check the chicken.
-Okay.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.023
-You helpin' Mom cook?
-Yep.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.818
It's hotshot chicken. You should stay.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.491
What's that?

40:11.075 --> 40:13.077
My friend's coming over. Jack.

40:13.828 --> 40:14.703
Good.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.498
Yeah, she doesn't like him.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.053
We arrested the guy, Rach.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.140
I am not going to testify.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.724
We charged on other crimes.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.645
For what it's worth, I just wanted
you to know that he was off the street.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.986
Here's... a counseling service.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.530
You're covered on my benefits.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.576
Talk to somebody, Rach.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.245
Maybe later.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.205
You can't carry
the whole weight by yourself.

40:59.498 --> 41:02.334
It's a little late for you
to be worrying about my burdens.

41:06.338 --> 41:09.008
I'm sorry I bullied you.
I got a little... crazy.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.138
I nearly killed the guy, Rachel.

41:16.348 --> 41:17.892
I wish you had.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.565
Annie, come say bye to Daddy.

41:24.648 --> 41:25.608
Rachel, I'm sorry.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.697
Mm!

41:34.366 --> 41:35.576
Movies tomorrow?

41:35.659 --> 41:37.411
-Pick you up at 6:00?
-Okay.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.996
Sure you don't want to stay for dinner?

41:39.079 --> 41:41.624
Mm, don't be such a troublemaker.

41:41.707 --> 41:42.583
Bye.

41:45.669 --> 41:46.712
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

41:51.550 --> 41:52.468
Hug for Josh.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.441
Gerald, you were Celestine's partner.
You did the crime together.

42:07.733 --> 42:10.069
I'm begging you to search
your memory one last time.

42:10.152 --> 42:14.281
Is there any assertion at all from your
testimony that convicted Celestine

42:14.365 --> 42:16.075
which you would want to change now?

42:16.200 --> 42:17.910
You saying I perjured myself before?

42:18.452 --> 42:21.080
Or are you asking me
to perjure myself now?

42:21.455 --> 42:22.456
Neither.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.041
It's got to be one of them two.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.752
See, I'm studyin' my law books
now, you know, ma'am.

42:26.835 --> 42:29.129
becoming a jailhouse lawyer,
all like that,

42:29.630 --> 42:31.257
get the library hours.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.717
And you wouldn't want to
jeopardize your privileges...

42:34.260 --> 42:36.053
even to save Celestine's life.

42:36.428 --> 42:39.098
There you go again,
wantin' me to perjure myself.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.809
You might have forgotten something, you
might have remembered something now.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.228
That's the way it was! We did that nun!

42:44.311 --> 42:45.396
I did her and he did her!

42:48.440 --> 42:50.568
-That's where it's at, ma'am.
-(stomps)

42:50.901 --> 42:52.611
(laughs)

42:53.320 --> 42:54.196
(sniffs)

42:54.613 --> 42:57.700
Now The Man say somebody gotta
be pushin' up daisies for it.

42:58.450 --> 42:59.827
And it's not going to be you.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.583
It's your system, lady.
I can live with it.

43:08.794 --> 43:10.045
(knocking)

43:26.061 --> 43:28.105
Did you think of anyone else
for me to call?

43:31.317 --> 43:32.318
Jackie Marsh.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.195
Address?

43:36.113 --> 43:37.948
My cousin might know where he's livin' at.

43:41.410 --> 43:42.369
What message?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.496
Say "goodbye."

43:45.581 --> 43:48.334
Celestine, maybe another lawyer
could have done better for you.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.377
I got no complaints.

43:51.086 --> 43:54.340
Maybe you could have gotten
the plea bargain instead of Gerald. I...

43:55.507 --> 43:56.967
If it's true, I apologize.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.969
I put myself here.

44:01.889 --> 44:02.848
Wait, wait a second!

44:02.931 --> 44:05.643
There's still some time, Celestine,
but your lawyer has to go outside.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.770
-CELESTINE: I want her to stay.
-MAN: We have to get you ready.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.480
CELESTINE: But I want my attorney present.

44:09.563 --> 44:12.066
She's gonna be present,
but she has to be in another room.

44:12.524 --> 44:14.693
-What's he doin'?
-He's gonna be with us.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.904
Celestine, pay attention to me.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.740
Pay attention to me, Celestine.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.951
We're gonna walk in there,
then we'll still have several minutes.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.244
Why don't you go ahead?

44:27.414 --> 44:28.707
(clicks)

44:29.375 --> 44:30.793
(clicks)

44:44.098 --> 44:46.225
(breathing unevenly)

44:56.568 --> 44:58.070
(metal squeaking)

45:05.494 --> 45:07.204
(clank)

45:07.788 --> 45:09.790
(whirring)

45:09.957 --> 45:12.084
(groans)

45:22.553 --> 45:23.971
Ernie, another tonic.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.770
Drinking to forget.

45:34.815 --> 45:38.318
I used up my alcohol quota
between when I was 15 and 34.

45:38.694 --> 45:42.322
Yeah, I think I used my quota
plus for my next incarnation.

45:42.948 --> 45:45.701
Hey, you don't believe
in any of that, do you,

45:45.784 --> 45:47.202
like reincarnation or anything?

45:48.203 --> 45:49.121
Not really.

45:49.913 --> 45:53.041
No? Like, not,
like, astrology or anything?

45:53.125 --> 45:54.960
I read my horoscope in the paper.

45:55.544 --> 45:56.503
Can't hurt, right?

46:04.261 --> 46:06.096
Could I, uh, buy you a drink?

46:06.180 --> 46:08.307
I still get a vicarious thrill.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.643
-Thanks.
-Again for the lady.

REPORTER (on TV):
<i>...the late murderer Celestine Grey</i>

46:13.395 --> 46:15.522
<i>died in the electric chair at 10:04 p.m.</i>

46:15.981 --> 46:18.358
God, they did it. They killed him.

46:18.567 --> 46:19.443
Who?

46:19.526 --> 46:22.029
The man who killed that nun,
they electrocuted him.

46:22.112 --> 46:25.115
-Oh, yeah.
<i>-...in September of 1983.</i>

46:25.199 --> 46:27.910
So, uh, what do you think about that?

46:27.993 --> 46:29.620
I don't think it solves anything.

46:29.703 --> 46:31.288
Amen to that.

46:31.371 --> 46:32.790
You against capital punishment?

46:32.873 --> 46:35.834
Absolutely. Hey, what does it solve?

46:36.376 --> 46:37.920
Ernie, give me that paper.

46:38.670 --> 46:39.505
Let me show you something.

46:43.467 --> 46:44.676
Mm-hmm.

46:48.388 --> 46:49.556
That's me.

46:50.682 --> 46:52.226
I caught a little flack for it at work,

46:52.309 --> 46:54.353
but I figure, you stand up and be counted.

46:55.896 --> 46:56.980
(chuckles)

46:58.982 --> 47:00.442
My name's Cathleen McConnell.

47:01.527 --> 47:03.487
Pleased to meet you, Cathleen McConnell.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.324
Pleased to meet you, Henry Goldblume.

47:08.909 --> 47:11.495
We offer this prayer for Celestine Grey.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.998
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.459
Lord Jesus Christ,

47:18.544 --> 47:20.754
you took our weaknesses upon yourself

47:21.296 --> 47:23.882
and bore our sufferings
in your passion and death.

47:24.842 --> 47:27.219
Hear this prayer
for our suffering brother,

47:27.302 --> 47:28.512
Celestine Grey.

47:29.805 --> 47:33.308
Here where he took life,
we ask you to forgive him

47:34.101 --> 47:36.103
and to strengthen his hope for salvation,

47:37.104 --> 47:39.314
as we ask you to strengthen
and forgive those

47:39.398 --> 47:41.692
who have taken life from him.

47:43.151 --> 47:45.320
You who are the redeemer of all men

47:45.988 --> 47:47.573
and who live and reign forever.

47:48.574 --> 47:50.158
-Amen.
-ALL: Amen.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.411
PRIEST: In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

47:52.494 --> 47:53.745
ALL: Amen.
